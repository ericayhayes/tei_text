PREFACE.&#xD;
SCENE.&#xD;
A front room in a house in Wahalak, Mississippi. The window open; through the&#xD;
casement a white rose throws its branches laden with bloom. Miss Hazard sitting in a&#xD;
rocking-chair near, reading, with no companion but a dog at her feet, and three kittens&#xD;
playing about the room.&#xD;
ENTER MR. ELMENDORF.&#xD;
Ah ! good afternoon, Miss Hazard ; glad to find you alone this after-&#xD;
noon !&#xD;
Aiss Hazard.-Alone$ do you call me alone?&#xD;
Mr. Elnendorf.-Certainly! cats and dogs are no company.&#xD;
Miss Hazard-I beg to differ with you, for they often amuse and in-&#xD;
terest me; I must certainly plead guilty of the enormity of loving such&#xD;
creatures ; but were I to agree with you there, and pronounce them ut-&#xD;
terly uninteresting and uncompanionable, what say you to Shakspeare,&#xD;
Irving, Scott, Tupper, and Hemans, who are on yonder shelf, and Bryant,&#xD;
who has been conversing with me since dinner, in some of his sweetest&#xD;
strains? Call you me alone with such companions?&#xD;
Mr. Elmendorf.-I will never again charge you with solitude ; but I&#xD;
am glad to find you without living companions.&#xD;
Aiss Fiazard (smiling and pointing to her dogs). See! Procyon seems&#xD;
to understand you, for he looks up in my face appealingly, as if to ask if&#xD;
he is so very insignificant, or, as we say in Mississippi, so no account.&#xD;
Mr. Elmendorf.-But Procyon is dumb, and therefore can neither in-&#xD;
terrupt our conversation nor detail it to others. I hear you have prepared&#xD;
Emma Stanley for the press, and that you have no preface to it. Is it so? I&#xD;
Miss Hazard.-And who made you so wise as to tell you any thing&#xD;
about it?&#xD;
Air. Elmendor f.-Yankee-like, you answer one question by asking an-&#xD;
other. Why not tell me if my information is correct?&#xD;
Miss Hazard-What right have you to ask?&#xD;
Mr. Elmendorf.-There, the Yankee again ! I have the right of a&#xD;
friend, and you are well aware that were it not from the most friendly&#xD;
considerations I should not interfere, and therefore I repeat the question,&#xD;
is my information correct?&#xD;
Miss Hazard.-It is !&#xD;
Mr. Elmendorf.-You are wrong to do so ! So lay aside your book&#xD;
and write one now.&#xD;
Miss Hazard.-A preface ! But why should I write a preface?&#xD;
Mr. Elmendorf.-I will follow your example, and answer your question&#xD;
by asking another. Would you send a young lady alone into the world,&#xD;
without a guide or protector of any kind, and not even give her a letter&#xD;
of introduction?&#xD;
Miss Hazard.-But what could I say in a preface, and how would it&#xD;
appear for the preface of a book to be dated from Wahalak ? The thing&#xD;
itself would be as unheard of as the place is unknown.&#xD;

CHAPTER       I.&#xD;
Joy for the freed one ! she might not stay,&#xD;
When the crown had fallen from her life away&#xD;
She might not linger a weary thing,&#xD;
A dove with no home for its broken wing.&#xD;
From the long heart-withering early gone,&#xD;
She hath lived-she hath loved-her task is done'!-HEMANs.&#xD;
THERE was sadness im the house of Capt. Stanley, though the&#xD;
face of nature wore her brightest smile, and the summer breeze&#xD;
just waved the white curtains of the bed, and the drapery of the&#xD;
windows floating in the wind, like the herald's flag of office,&#xD;
seemed to offer peace to all within. Yet, even the soothing in-&#xD;
fluences of nature were unheeded by its afflicted inmates ; for in&#xD;
one room sat Miss Stanley watching by the bedside of the infant&#xD;
daughter of her brother, and in another, in separate coffins, lay&#xD;
the bodies of Capt. Stanley and his wife. He had been attacked&#xD;
by the fever about a week previously, and on the second day be-&#xD;
fore that of which we speak, had died. His wife had watched&#xD;
by his side until the angel of death had stopped his utterance&#xD;
with his icy fingers, and then, when she spoke to him and re-&#xD;
ceived no answer, the dreadful knowledge that all hope was&#xD;
gone fell like an icebolt upon her heart. She fainted, and was&#xD;
carried to another room. After some time she showed signs of&#xD;
recovery: she opened her eyes, and placed her hand to her fore-&#xD;
head, as if trying to remember why she was there, then she&#xD;
looked upwards-" Take me too, O Father !" said she; "do n'ot&#xD;
divide us."  And her prayer was heard. She spoke no more,&#xD;
and those who came from her husband's room to say that his&#xD;
spirit had fled, were just in time to witness the last long sigh of&#xD;
her who had loved so well. And now there they lay, both&#xD;
beautiful in death; for both had been touched with a smile by&#xD;
the hand of that ministering spirit who paints for eternity the&#xD;
faces of the dead.&#xD;
Soon the heavy bell boomed forth its note of sorrow, to sum-&#xD;
mon those who were to pay the last tribute of respect to the&#xD;
&#xD;

dep1artctl. A t tit first -troke, the family came in to take their&#xD;
solrmn farewell. I'irst catne his sister-she was about thirty-&#xD;
ti; sh''  lire in her arms the infant Emma, whose feeble wail,&#xD;
asit h fr an in-tant hid her ovet the coffin, told in the same&#xD;
not that the orphan recognized the inmate of that narrow house,&#xD;
and also how much disease had enfeebled its own fragile form.&#xD;
Mi- Stinlv hid by the hand a little boy about nine years old,&#xD;
who wept so violently that it was impossible for him to beheld&#xD;
hi  parent,.  A  little behindd him came his elder btrothe:, a&#xD;

I 'mulous mtion of his lip, that his grief, though unexpressed,&#xD;
was only the more agonizing. He went and gazed a moment&#xD;
on his father, then, as if unable to endure the sight, he turned&#xD;
away, dashed a tiar from  his eve, atnd walked to where his&#xD;
mother lay. For an instant he loitkd upon her face, then threw&#xD;
lit arms around the coin, as if he would once more embrace&#xD;
htr, and, h tndin d own, ie itmprinted upon her cold lips a kiss,&#xD;
ln, a  it his mul w«eire there, but tender as if he feared to dis-&#xD;
turb her re-t. At length he lifted his head, drew one deep&#xD;
sigh, rtteled frward1, andl\i would have fallen had not sonic one&#xD;

'I will,''&#xD;
i ri se and went into his own room, and for a few moments&#xD;
ni sounds proceeded forth but his convulsive sobs. They ceased,&#xD;
and then one might hear his voice in low but earnest prayer.&#xD;
In thte curse of half an hour, just as the procession was forming&#xD;
at the door, he came out apparently as calm as any of those&#xD;
around him, and took his place with his aunt and brother as&#xD;
chief mourner. ie stood uncovered at the grave, and saw the&#xD;
coffins both committed to the earth; and it was not until the&#xD;

EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.               7&#xD;
solemn sound of dust to dust met his ear that he again wept ;&#xD;
but then his tears fell naturally, and, like dew upon the earth,&#xD;
they softened his heart without disturbing the young virtues&#xD;
sown there by love and grief.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
Where were flown&#xD;
Our hope, if man were left to man's decree alone ?-HEMiANS.&#xD;
ABOUT a month after the events recorded in our last chapter,&#xD;
in the director's room of the Mercantile Bank'of Newport, Rhode&#xD;
Island, the board met for the transaction of business, and the&#xD;
first that was proposed was two notes, with the name of Charles&#xD;
Stanley as first endorser, drawn in favor of a man who the week&#xD;
before had pleaded the act of insolvency to escape a prison.&#xD;
Both notes were due, and both for a large amount.&#xD;
"What shall be done with those ?" said the president of the&#xD;
board, speaking generally, but looking at the brother-in-law of&#xD;
Capt. Stanley, who was usually one of the chief speakers, a&#xD;
proud, handsome man, but one who looked as if his soul could&#xD;
not know pity, and who, for that reason, was generally appealed&#xD;
to if there was any business to transact at which milder natures&#xD;
would shrink; but ere he could reply, the president was hastily&#xD;
answered by a man seated at the opposite side of the table,&#xD;
who appeared to be in every respect the reverse of Mr. Wither-&#xD;
ington.&#xD;
"Certainly, we had better lose the debt entirely than now to&#xD;
add one to the trials which the family have so lately suffered ;&#xD;
for my own part, my fortune is small, but I would cheerfully&#xD;
bear my share of the loss rather than to distress them now."&#xD;
"Distress them now !" hastily interposed Mr. Witherington;&#xD;
"if their afflictions are already as heavy as you would make us&#xD;
believe, what will be the loss of a little of their extra wealth?&#xD;
Have they not all their lives been rolling in luxury? It is my&#xD;
opinion that we should not lose the debt, but that sufficient of&#xD;
the property should be taken to pay it."&#xD;
"If only sufficient could be taken at a fair valuation," resumed&#xD;
Mr. Chapman, "I should say so too, or at least I would not op-&#xD;
pose you perhaps; but you know at such a time how things are&#xD;
sacrificed at an auction, and to pay both these notes in that&#xD;
manner will sweep' every thing from the family. At least give&#xD;
them six months' warning, so as to have a chance to sell at&#xD;

other."&#xD;
"Mr. Chapman will perhaps pay one note out of his private&#xD;
purso rather than to distress one old maid, two stout boys, and&#xD;
a sickly girl, whom  it would be a mercy to let follow its&#xD;
parent."&#xD;
Yes, indeed, it would. Oh, how that poor babe's melan-&#xD;
holy wail went to my heart, as it stretched out its little hands&#xD;
over its mother's cofin !"&#xD;
Order, order !" exclaimed the president; "you forget, gen-&#xD;
tlemen, that corporate bodies have no souls, and that every thing&#xD;
but busines must be excluded here."&#xD;
"Why," said a man upon his right hand, whose portly figure&#xD;
and extreme attention to dress, told that the good things of this&#xD;
world were not unknown to him, but at the same time who had&#xD;
an air of low breeding about him, which told just as plainly that&#xD;
he had not always mingled with the magnates of the land, "it is&#xD;
certainly a pity to distress the family, but as Mr. Witherington&#xD;
approves it, and as I suppose he will be present to see that no&#xD;
needle sacrif&amp;amp;ee i made, I don't consider it at all incumbent&#xD;
upon us to Iose the amount.  Stanley knew what sort of a man&#xD;
Billings w as before h went his security, for it is only about two&#xD;
years sin  he had to par a debt of the same kind to this very&#xD;
bank for the samne man for five thousand dollars; and if, after&#xD;
such a warnin, he chose to risk it again, surely he should suffer&#xD;
and not surl&#xD;
" But shiubl hi. family again suffer ?'' interposed Mr. Chap-&#xD;
man.   ln t hi,    th le guilty has gone to another tribunal&#xD;

There was a silence unbroken for a few moments, then Mr.&#xD;
Chapman, who for that interval had gazed alternated upon all&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLE Y, OR THE ORPHANS.               9&#xD;
those around him, arose : "Gentlemen," said he, "alone I op-&#xD;
pose this resolution. I sincerely grieve that, though all around&#xD;
me have families, I find none to second my exertions in favor&#xD;
of the fatherless ; but I oppose it, and will no longer serve in&#xD;
a board where it can be carried into effect. Mr. President, I&#xD;
resign my place ; I am no longer a director." Again he looked&#xD;
sternly into the face of each individual, every one of whom&#xD;
shrank as they met the lofty glance of his calm eye. He then&#xD;
turned, and, amidst the unbroken silence of those momentarily&#xD;
humbled men, he left the apartment.&#xD;
It was not until the sound of his last step had died away,&#xD;
that the silence was broken, then the tone of business was re-&#xD;
sumed, and no further allusion was made to the affair of Capt.&#xD;
Stanley.&#xD;
CHAPTER       III.&#xD;
Swift-footed is the approach of woe;&#xD;
But with a lingering step and slow,&#xD;
Its form departs.-COPLAS DE MENLAS.&#xD;
ANOTHER month had passed, and even the lacerated hearts&#xD;
of the sister and orphans were sinking into peace, when one after-&#xD;
noon, just as Miss Stanley had soothed her little niece into a&#xD;
quiet repose, Mr. Witherington was announced. She rose to re-&#xD;
ceive him, but for some time after he was seated he did not&#xD;
speak, the chastened expression of his sister-in-law, whose suffer-&#xD;
ing had added pallor to a countenance in which was singularly&#xD;
blended meekness and heroism, patient, trusting confidence, and&#xD;
lofty self-reliance, took from him for an instant the power to in-&#xD;
flict pain. Even the proud, the selfish, the hard-hearted Wither-&#xD;
ington was constrained at her presence. He knew her character&#xD;
--he knew that, mingled with the credulous trust of woman,&#xD;
was an energy of purpose, and .a quick-sightedness to wrong,&#xD;
that he feared to awaken. At length he broke the silence by&#xD;
asking her what plans she intended to pursue with regard to the&#xD;
children, how she intended to dispose of them?&#xD;
"Keep them here with me, to be sure. Carry out the plans&#xD;
which Charles had begun. Our noble Jared in little more than&#xD;
a year will be fit for college, and with the aid of his father's am-&#xD;
ple fortune I hope yet to see him the boast of his country."&#xD;

ceedingly agitated, " I will try what can be lone for the sake of&#xD;

thought t hat if he succeeded she would confide in him as in a&#xD;
friend, which she much needed, and she would adopt the coun-&#xD;
sel which he might give her, supposing that he would be as&#xD;
much in her favor as the law and his unfeeling disposition would&#xD;
permit him; but at the same time determining if he were not suc-&#xD;
cessful never to seek him to direct her, or rely upon his' support.&#xD;
He saw why she spoke thus, and felt that if he wished ever to&#xD;
pursue his own schemes with regard to the family, he must make&#xD;
her strongly believe him her friend, and he therefore determined&#xD;
to defer the levy for two weeks, and immediately proceeded to&#xD;
put his resolve into operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
He had scarcely left the house when Mr. Chapman came in:&#xD;
soon after he took his seat he began to inquire after the health&#xD;
of -the children ; but it was in terms so earnest and so kind, that&#xD;
it seemed as if hope waited only his bidding to spring up in the&#xD;
heart of the disconsolate, and ere he had been there long, Miss&#xD;
Stanley felt that the cheerfulness which Mr. Witherington had so&#xD;
effectually banished, was again resuming its accustomed place&#xD;
in her heart. She asked him if he knew of the change in the&#xD;
prospects of the orphans. He told her that it was to speak of&#xD;
that .change that he had left home; but as he had met Mr.&#xD;
Witherington at the door he supposed that she was already ap-&#xD;
prised of it, and that of course it was useless for him to say any&#xD;
thing upon the subject, unless she wished for some friend to&#xD;
advise with, in which case he was ever ready to serve her-that&#xD;
she knew that his circumstances forbade his giving her pecuniary&#xD;
aid ; but in any thing in which he could serve her he would feel&#xD;
gratified by so doing.&#xD;
He sat with her for some time, and continued to cheer her&#xD;
with hopes drawn from every available source, but particularly&#xD;
from that one whence she had always derived them; and so much&#xD;
did his converse lead her towards heaven, that ere he took his&#xD;
leave she felt that she could sincerely say, these .troubles must&#xD;
be best for me-" because they are 7iy will."&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
Over thine orphan head&#xD;
The storm hath swept as o'er a willow's bough.-HEANs.&#xD;
THE two weeks ran rapidly by in which Mr. Witherington&#xD;
often called with specious offers of service; and Miss Stanley&#xD;
often asked him if nothing could be saved for the children, to&#xD;
which he always replied-Nothing consistently with honor !&#xD;
that it would be absolutely necessary for her to give up every&#xD;
thing ; and except the wearing apparel of the deceased, she suf-&#xD;
fered every thing to be carried to the auction-room, and in one&#xD;
day she saw herself, as the representative of her brother, reduced&#xD;
from wealth to poverty, and compelled to leave a house which&#xD;
in size and decorations might do for the seat of a nobleman, and&#xD;
with her young charges occupy a small house; and that almost&#xD;
£ empty. Fortunately she possessed a small jointure which had&#xD;
been bequeathed her by her parents, and that kept her from im-&#xD;

her from undertaking. Richard had lately declared himself al-&#xD;
most a man, and Jared was near the conclusion of his last term&#xD;
of tuition preparatory to his leaving for college. However, on&#xD;
the anniversary of that day which had deprived him of both his&#xD;
parents he craved permission to remain at home ; his aunt shared&#xD;
his melancholy feelings too deeply to deny his request, and he&#xD;
remained alone nearly all day. In the afternoon he came into the&#xD;
room where his aunt was sitting, and took his place by her side ;&#xD;
he remained silent for some time. At length he raised his eyes&#xD;
to his aunt's face, and spoke in a voice so filled with sadness that&#xD;
the tones at once awakened her attention. "I have been think-&#xD;
ing," said he, "my dear aunt, that your little patrimony will be&#xD;
melted away in a very short time if you continue to support us&#xD;
all; nay, I have already observed that you no longer indulge&#xD;
yourself in little luxuries that you formerly considered neces-&#xD;
saries, and now I am a large boy,.quite large enough to gain my.&#xD;
own living. You know how I pine after the sea. Capt. West&#xD;
got in to-day from Liverpool. He will sail again in about a&#xD;
month. Let me join his crew, and thus free your hands of one&#xD;
incumbrance, and in a few years," he added, and his brow&#xD;
brightened as he spoke, for hope was whispering at his heart,&#xD;
"in a few years I shall be able to assist you; perhaps I may have&#xD;
a ship of my own, and-"&#xD;
His aunt clasped him to her heart. "My noble boy," said&#xD;
she, "you have not yet felt the struggles against poverty ; born&#xD;
to wealth, you have yet only had a glimpse of the reverse.&#xD;
Hope holds before your eyes the picture which she presents only&#xD;
to youth, and you think that you have but to wish and your&#xD;
wishes will be accomplished; that you have only to exert your&#xD;
energies, and they will bring to pass all you desire ; but, my son,&#xD;
though I do not wish to damp the ardent aspirations of your na-&#xD;
ture, yet, believe me, that you will see the good, the generous,&#xD;
the honorable, the virtuous fail, where the artful, the designing,&#xD;
and the unprincipled will succeed; that the candid and the&#xD;
frank-hearted will be borne down by the corrupt and the hypo-&#xD;
critical ; that noble poverty will often have to bow her head, and&#xD;
leave the place to wealthy vice."&#xD;
"But yet I shall have to try these scenes ! I must go out&#xD;
and struggle with the world, and when shall I be more fitted for&#xD;
it than now&#xD;
"When you are older-when your principles are more indeli-&#xD;
bly fixed-when you feel as well as know that God will reward&#xD;
your piety, good faith, high principles, and worthy conduct,&#xD;

cradle, v-et hier friends could see that there was an improvement&#xD;
in her constitution : for she was not now so continually hovering&#xD;
bet  en lifP and death as she had been for the first three months&#xD;
after hr p rent' decease. She was now nearly three years old,&#xD;
and by her prattle she had often cheered her aunt. She had&#xD;

attainment which her great weakness had until lately prevented&#xD;

fish man ; I should have added an envious one too ; and he had&#xD;
determined that his sons should not only inherit his wealth, but&#xD;
if possible should in every way eclipse all around them. With&#xD;
these feelings he had watched the development of the mind of&#xD;
the young Jared, and had seen him, whether at school or in any&#xD;
other situation in which they had been together placed, bear off&#xD;
the palm of praise from his own sons, though they were the&#xD;
eldest ; and for this superiority he had hated him with all the&#xD;
bitterness which envy could prompt, and it was this which had&#xD;
made him act with such cold-heartedness towards Miss Stan-&#xD;
ley ; for he had determined if his sons were eclipsed in intellect,&#xD;
that they should not be in wealth. And to gratify these feelings&#xD;
he now wanted to get the young Jared into his employ to make&#xD;
him feel his inferiority, and if possible to bend his aspiring&#xD;
spirit, and to make him stoop to him. But he knew that force&#xD;
was no way to overcome the wishes of-his nephew, and there-&#xD;
fore to Miss Stanley he professed the most anxious regard for&#xD;
his welfare, and succeeded in making her so far enter into his&#xD;
views as to feel grateful for his offer, and desirous that her&#xD;
nephew should accept it ; and when he returned from  a visit&#xD;
which he had been paying to one of his young friends, she men-&#xD;
tioned to him his uncle's offer.&#xD;
Do you wish me to accept it ?" he asked.&#xD;
I do not wish you to do violence to your inclinations ; but I&#xD;
dread for you the hardships of a sailor's life. If you accept it&#xD;
you will be near me-I shall see you every day ; if you go to&#xD;
sea,your visits to me will be indeed like angels'."&#xD;
I know and have thought of that much in these last few&#xD;
days ; but you are deceived in uncle Witherington. I should&#xD;
find him despotic and severe, and I know that with him I should&#xD;
-'      unhappyp"&#xD;
bDo as you wish, my son ; but I should like for you to see&#xD;
your uncle before you decide, or before you make an irrevocable&#xD;
agreement with Captain West; and if he fails to shake your&#xD;
resolution I will give you my consent and my blessing."&#xD;
The next day he went to Mr. Witherington's store ; but in-&#xD;
stead of his uncle he found one of his cousins. After they had&#xD;
talked a while upon general topics, George Witherington ab-&#xD;
ruptly said that he heard that a change had taken place in his&#xD;
views as in his circumstances, and that he was going to barter&#xD;
his liberty a while for some of his uncle's cash.&#xD;
The blood rushed to young Stanley's brow at the tone'of the&#xD;
speech, and also at the taunt conveyed. For a few moments he&#xD;
did not trust himself to reply. "I think not," said he, at last ;&#xD;

tanle still intended for him to go through college, and offering&#xD;
if shedlid not to take him into his counting-room; for he knew&#xD;
of his proficiency in writig and accounts, and thought that in&#xD;
him he might have a valuable clerk without paying much salary&#xD;
for him.&#xD;
Miss St tnlev urged his desire for the sea.&#xD;
Mr. Witherington represented all the dangers of the sea, as&#xD;
well as its hardships, with so much force that she determined to&#xD;
use her influence with her nephew to prevail upon him to&#xD;
act-pt his'uncle's offer ; but had she known the motives of&#xD;

" You don't mean to say that you refuse ?"&#xD;
" I think I mu t.''&#xD;
"And pray what are you going to do with yourself? Do you&#xD;
intend to enter college and see if the professors there will be as&#xD;
partial as your schoolmaster here has been, and give you all the&#xD;
prizes ?"&#xD;
" Were I to enter college I should certainly try to gain the&#xD;
prizes, not from the partiality of my teachers, but by endeavor-&#xD;
ing industriously to improve the talents which God has given&#xD;
rme.'&#xD;
Come, come, it is in vain for you to deny that old White&#xD;
was partial; but tell me, do you intend to enter college ?"&#xD;
No; the ruin of our property denies that. I suspect the&#xD;
college which I shall shortly enter will be a Liverpool packet, of&#xD;
which sailors will be the professors."&#xD;
" What ! You don't really think of going to sea ! You don't&#xD;
truly prefer the salt sea and the hard berth of a sailor to a place&#xD;
here ! We will try and change that resolution."&#xD;
You will try in vain."&#xD;
Oh no, my dear coz," said George, softening ; for though&#xD;
he had imbibed some of his father's envy of Jared by seeing him-&#xD;
self always thrown in the shade by him, yet he had a respect&#xD;
for his virtues and an appreciation of his extremely brilliant&#xD;
talents, which made him unwilling that he should sink them in&#xD;
an ordinary sailor. " Oh no ! if you stay here you will in a few&#xD;
years make enough to set out in life with, and at the same time&#xD;
have an opportunity of reading enough to improve yourself so&#xD;
as to make all of us proud of you."&#xD;
a But if I go to sea 1 shall at once see the countries of which&#xD;
you would have me read. I shall step out into the world at&#xD;
once, and if I never make you proud of me, I at least shall never&#xD;
make myself a burden to you. So say no more ; to sea&#xD;

After waiting a short time to see his uncle, he left and went&#xD;
down to the wharf, where he found Captain West, and after a&#xD;
short conversation he agreed to take his place on board the ship&#xD;
and commence his duty there in two weeks, though he was not&#xD;
to sail in four.&#xD;
When he left home he had intended to have conversed with&#xD;
his uncle before he made this agreement, in accordance with his&#xD;

CHAPTER       VI.&#xD;
Oh bitter to the youthful heart,&#xD;
That scarce a pang, a care has known,&#xD;
The hour when first from scenes we part,&#xD;
Where life's bright spring has flown;&#xD;
Forsaking, o'er the world to roam,&#xD;
That little shrine of peace--our home.-HEMANS.&#xD;
THE next day he went to take leave of his old schoolmaster&#xD;
and his former schoolmates. The old man appeared shocked&#xD;
when he told him of his plans for the future. He made him sit&#xD;
down by his side, and for nearly an hour advised him how to&#xD;
guide himself in life. Then he opened the book in which he&#xD;
always inscribed the names of his scholars. "More than two&#xD;
thousands pupils have I taught," said he, "but round none of&#xD;
their names have I ever more fondly hoped to see the wreath&#xD;
of immortality given by fame entwined than round yours ; and&#xD;
none of my pupils have ever given a brighter promise than your-&#xD;
self. But roses grow not upon rocks, and you have chosen a&#xD;
rough and stony path; but you have the prayers of an old man&#xD;
that God will smooth it before you. Farewell !"  As he spoke&#xD;
he laid his hand upon his head and raised his eyes to heaven.&#xD;
The youth turned, drew his hand across his eyes to brush away&#xD;
the tears. He then went among the scholars and shook hands&#xD;
with each one of them, though not a word was spoken; for each&#xD;
felt that silence was necessary to his self-command. The old&#xD;
man watched the countenances that surrounded him, and felt&#xD;
that the chord of melancholy which he had touched was vibrating&#xD;
too strongly and too long, and that as he had first put it in mo-&#xD;
tion he must cause it to react. As young Stanley shook hands&#xD;
with the last one, Mr. White himself broke silence: "Let us&#xD;
give him as a farewell three times three, my boys," saidhe ; and&#xD;
the roof of the academy rang with his own huzza. In the first&#xD;
shout there were but few of the boys joined, but the third was a&#xD;
full chorus of forty human voices at their loudest' pitch ; then all&#xD;
sank into silence. Young Stanley in the mean time had walked&#xD;

s:de ; and plungig ito) the thickest part of it, he tried to calm&#xD;
his overurdenedI feelings by communing with nature. Tt was&#xD;
some time before he succeeded. lie had on that and the pre-&#xD;
eding lay set the seal to his destiny ; he had relinquished hopes&#xD;
which for three or hur years had been his daily thought-the&#xD;
ida of g ing honorably through college, and of afterwards be-&#xD;
coming something of which the whole country would be proud.&#xD;
A Marshall or a  Webster had mingled with every lesson which&#xD;
. had recited, and now so suddenly and so entirely to give it up,&#xD;
and to live the hard life of a sailor ; and then, that solemn and&#xD;
sint parting with his revered teacher and with all those who&#xD;
had     l4ng shared his study and his play, altogether had for a&#xD;
w hile entirely overcome him.&#xD;
That week and the following Miss Stanley busied herself in&#xD;
pw parations for the departure of Jared, and though to him she&#xD;
talked of it calmly and encouragingly, yet many a tear did she&#xD;
dry p upon her work, as she plied the busy needle to fit him for&#xD;
th Iw li he had  iusen.  She regretted his choice ; for the sister&#xD;
of a sailor, she was but too well acquainted with the toils and&#xD;
tiuas ti w  1hich  e would be exposed, many of which lie had not&#xD;
yet dreamed : but yet, she felt that the evils of a lot which he&#xD;
dountarily followed, would be more easily borne than those of&#xD;
one to which The might direct him, and, therefore, she now only&#xD;
endeav Ired to fortify his mind to hear up against those which he&#xD;
might have to encounter.&#xD;
At length the day of parting came, and with many prayers&#xD;
Miss Stanley endeavored to strengthen her heart for the bitter&#xD;
pang. She had given her nephew many directions for his future&#xD;
conduct.  She had warned him of the many evils he would have&#xD;
to shun, in order to steer his course according to the law of that&#xD;
(od which, amidst all the vicissitudes of a sailor's life, his father&#xD;
ha de lighted to follow. And now the hour was arrived in&#xD;
which he was to go from her, with no stay but his own good&#xD;
pinneilples, ani dependent alone upon the Father of the fatherless.&#xD;
At dinner he appeared in his sailor's dress : it was the first&#xD;
time that he had worn it. He took his seat with a smile, but sad-&#xD;
nes was gnawing at his heart, and he could not eat.  He rose&#xD;
foni table and approached his aunt.  "It is -ime to go," said&#xD;
e, She rose also, and opened her arms: for a moment he hid&#xD;
his head upon her shoulder, but by an effort he mastered his&#xD;
emotion ; he kissed her with filial affection, and moved to go.&#xD;
God bless and keep you, my son !" said Miss Stanley.&#xD;
He,ared not trust himself again to speak, but hastily kissing&#xD;
&#xD;
his brother, and stooping a moment over the cradle of his sleep-&#xD;
ing sister he hastened~ from the house, and then whistling to&#xD;
keep down the tears, he almost ran to the wharf, and in an hour&#xD;
after the vessel was gallantly sailing out of the harbor, with a&#xD;
fine fair breeze, as if no aching heart was under the shelter of its&#xD;
snowy sails.&#xD;
CHAPTER       VII.&#xD;
Friendship's sweet and fairy strain&#xD;
Shall ever in her heart remain,&#xD;
Nor memory lose, nor time impair,&#xD;
The sympathies which tremble there.--Mooal.&#xD;
TuouG HMiss Stanley saw many who, in her prosperity, had&#xD;
professed themselves her friends, leave her in her adverse cir-&#xD;
cumstances, yet her many virtues had endeared her to a numer-&#xD;
ous circle of acquaintances, and she found that she had small&#xD;
cause to complain of desertion. Among those who seemed to&#xD;
think more of her than formerly, was an old woman who had&#xD;
once been housekeeper for her mother. She was now advanced&#xD;
in age, perhaps sixty-five years old : a woman of many eccen-&#xD;
tricities of character, but of some peculiar virtues. Honest to a&#xD;
fault herself, she was yet suspicious of others to as great a de-&#xD;
gree; never trusting where she could possibly avoid it, but yet,&#xD;
when trusted, acting with the same degree of exactness for an-&#xD;
other that she would do for herself. The day after Captain&#xD;
Stanley was taken sick, Miss Hoxie took up her abode there as&#xD;
nurse, and now when Miss Stanley (who had been her pet when&#xD;
she was an infant) was in poverty and desolate, she remained&#xD;
with her, taking from her the drudgery of housekeeping, and&#xD;
mingling the character of servant and friend. They had spoken&#xD;
upon the subject of her staying there once, for Miss Stanley knew&#xD;
that she was unable to give her such remuneration for her ser-&#xD;
vices as they merited ; but Miss Hoxie, like a spoiled child, had&#xD;
apparently become angry, because she was contradicted. And&#xD;
r        thus, for that time, ended the colloquy, for she knew that her&#xD;
_ F      services were needed, and she only wanted to give them without&#xD;
.-       a reward; but suspecting that they would not be so received, she&#xD;
-       took refuge from the subject in seeming anger, knowing that by&#xD;
that means she could silence opposition, and thus continue with&#xD;
her favorite until better times should dawn, or until she should&#xD;
lay herself down to sleep with her fathers. But though these&#xD;
were her feelings, Miss Stanley's were far different. She could&#xD;
&#xD;

nmt bear to impose upon her faithful devotion, or to accept from&#xD;
hr series in her old age which she could not reward, and&#xD;
which she knew were of such a nature as would command from&#xD;
ethers ready pay. She determined to make one more effort to&#xD;
shake her generous resolves, and if not successful, to leave all to&#xD;
time. With this thought she went into the kitchen, where the&#xD;
old lady was sitting, busily employed reeling some linen thread&#xD;
from a little wheel by her side. She was dressed in an old-&#xD;
fashioned calico gown, made with a boddice-waist, and open in&#xD;
front, with short sleeves made tight to the arm. Around her&#xD;
neck was a plain muslin three-cornered handkerchief, neatly&#xD;
starched, which might have rivalled the snow in whiteness ; her&#xD;
long gray hair was put up in what I suppose was the fashion&#xD;
when she first assumed caps, that is, she wore upon the top of&#xD;
her head a pad which she called a cushion; it was about as broad&#xD;
as one's hand, and about twice as thick: this was surmounted by&#xD;
a plain mob cap, of the same material as her handkerchief, and&#xD;
seemed the only thing that in point of neatness could have ap-&#xD;
proached it. As Miss Stanley took her seat by her, she began&#xD;
to chew furiously upon a piece of tobacco which she had in her&#xD;
mouth, and with which she was always well provided ; then she&#xD;
put her hand into first one pocket and then the other, as if look-&#xD;
ing for something which she could not find, for she suspected the&#xD;
object of the visit; but it all would not do. At length she&#xD;
turned round, and looking her in the face--" What have you&#xD;
come here for, Nancy ?" said she.&#xD;
"I have come, Miss Iloxie, to speak once more to you upon&#xD;
the terms of our living together."&#xD;
" Well, you may go again !" said she, with peculiar emphasis&#xD;
upon the word go, "for I want to hear nothing ye've got to&#xD;
say upon the subject."&#xD;
But I consider it my duty that we should understand each&#xD;
other."&#xD;
"1 understand ye well enough. Have not I carried ye in&#xD;
my arms before ye could walk, and sung ye to sleep every night&#xD;
of your life till ye were ten years old ! and now ye talk about&#xD;
understanding each other. If ye can't understand me by this&#xD;
time ye never will. So now hold your tongue !"&#xD;
She had a peculiar manner of speaking every word with&#xD;
marked distinctness, and almost screaming out those which she&#xD;
wished to emphasize; but it was a rare thing to speak so&#xD;
much at one time as she had just spoken, and she never did it&#xD;
unless excited by strong feeling, though she would talk by short&#xD;
sentences for hours together.&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.               21&#xD;
Miss Stanley was aware of this, and though almost startled by&#xD;
her authoritative manner of crying out, "Hold your tongue !"&#xD;
yet thought she would try a little more, and she continued, "But,&#xD;
my dear Miss Hoxie, you know-"&#xD;
"I don't know any thing, and I don't want to know any thing&#xD;
ye have got to say, and if ye choose to stay here and talk, why&#xD;
talk, but I won't hear ye," and she got up and went out.&#xD;
Miss Stanley thought she would soon return, and sat for&#xD;
some time awaiting her, but she was disappointed. At length&#xD;
the little Emma's voice called her away, and as soon as she left&#xD;
the kitchen, Miss Hoxie, who had been all the time standing by&#xD;
the door waiting for her exit, re-entered and resumed her place&#xD;
by her wheel.&#xD;

JAIRED had made his fourth voyage to Liverpool without once&#xD;
revisiting Newport, because he could not do so without losing&#xD;
his berth on board, and consequently in that time a letter about&#xD;
every six weeks had been the only tidings his aunt had received&#xD;
from him. Over some of them she had sighed, for he had uncon-&#xD;
sciously betrayed by them that he had awakened from some of&#xD;
the illusions of youth, but she, was glad to see by them that he&#xD;
improved his time in the cultivation of his mind. His last letter,&#xD;
however, was written in excellent spirits: he had been promoted&#xD;
to the office of second mate, and he was coming home to see her.&#xD;
Capt. West would give him high recommendations, and as he&#xD;
had become rather wearied of the Liverpool trip, he intended,&#xD;
y        after staying a while at Newport, to get a berth in some vessel&#xD;
going to some other port. And he was really coming home !&#xD;
that was the part of the letter which made Miss Stanley's heart&#xD;
beat quicker, and upon comparing the date of it and the time&#xD;
since, with what he said must elapse, she might begin to expect&#xD;
him that very day. This thought took from her all capability&#xD;
of doing any thing with her accustomed method, and after trying&#xD;
to compose herself to several things, and finding herself unsue-&#xD;

EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
23&#xD;
&#xD;
-MMA sTANLEY, OR THE ORPUANS.&#xD;
-al in all, she took little Emma and determined to go and&#xD;
carry the glad news to her sister, Mrs. Witherington ; for&#xD;
though she began to have an almost undefinable dislike for Mr.&#xD;
Witherington, vet she was upon terms of intimacy with the family,&#xD;
for she believed her sister felt affectionately towards her; and&#xD;
even had she thought otherwise, she was not one who would&#xD;
willinglv snap asunder bonds which had been formed by nature.&#xD;
Sh, would prefer to bear much from one who could claim her&#xD;
fP rbearance by the sacred name of relative.&#xD;
While she is walking onwards I will give a short description of&#xD;
the family of Mr. W. Ilis wife was one of that kind of women&#xD;
who take for granted that her husband is always right, and that&#xD;
whoever differs from him must be wrong. Always willing to&#xD;
yield her own opinions to his, she was but a softened mirror of&#xD;
his feelings. She pitied her sister and the orphans, but her sym-&#xD;
pathv was not of that active kind which would ever be of any&#xD;
t-cential service to them ; she was kind to them when they were&#xD;
near her, but she left them to go on as they could.&#xD;
The eldest son, George, has been already introduced ; he&#xD;
had now attained the age of manhood. The eldest daughter,&#xD;
Lucy, was a beauty and a belle. She had been educated with&#xD;
all the care that fortune could bestow, and being naturally&#xD;
talented, and inheriting from her father a disposition to outvie all&#xD;
around her, she had improved the advantages that had been&#xD;
given her, and had the faculty of showing them in the most al-&#xD;
luring manner. She acquired the habit of saying agreeable&#xD;
things to those whom she wished to please, in such a manner as&#xD;
to be almost irresistible ; but if any one incurred her dislike, few&#xD;
would willingly encounter a second time the unbounded hauteur&#xD;
and withering scorn by which she would manifest her displeasure.&#xD;
She had a violent temper, with absolute command over it when-&#xD;
ever she chose ; and to prosecute any object, even while loathing&#xD;
a person, she would approach them in a manner so winning, and,&#xD;
at tih- same time, with so much apparent artlessness, that one&#xD;
must have known her intimately, indeed, to have accused her of&#xD;
insincerity. With such a (isposition she was feared by her own&#xD;
family-by her inferiors she was hated-by her own sex gener-&#xD;
ally, at once flattered and shunned--and by the gentlemen al-&#xD;
most adored. Her sister Harriet was of a very different disposition.&#xD;
Placid even to weakness, she was alternately the' tool and the&#xD;
dupe of the imperious Lucy. Their brother Robert was now at&#xD;
meolee. lie was warm-hearted and convivial, but partaking too&#xD;
largely of the yielding character of his mother and. younger sis-&#xD;
ter, he was too easily led into every temptation. Called the&#xD;
&#xD;
handsomest youth at college, and flattered by the many who&#xD;
basely bow to wealth or power, he thought it was unnecessary&#xD;
to improve his time, and was rapidly running headlong into dis-&#xD;
sipation, and sowing the seeds of future misery.&#xD;
Mrs. Witherington received her with her accustomed cor-&#xD;
diality, and as Lucy happened to be in one of her blandest hu-&#xD;
mors, she was almost overwhelmed with kindness. All of them&#xD;
seemed to partake of her joy in the anticipation of Jared's speedy&#xD;
return ; and seeing that Miss Stanley was completely unhinged&#xD;
by the idea of the time of his return being so near, they tried&#xD;
every way to cheer her, or rather to divert her mind from its&#xD;
overburdening joy ; and they succeeded. She became calm, and&#xD;
seating herself by a window which had a fine view of the bay,&#xD;
she had begun to talk cheerfully of other things, when a vessel&#xD;
hove in sight : that circumstance again renewed her agitation, a&#xD;
telescope was brought, and, as the ship rounded to, she read upon&#xD;
its stern the name of "The Watchman," the very packet in&#xD;
which he had left when he had gone down to New York with&#xD;
his captain, to take their places on board the ship in which they&#xD;
=     had since sailed, and she immediately decided that he must be&#xD;
on board. Her relatives found it impossible to detain her a mo-&#xD;
ment-she must meet him at home, and she hastily departed ;&#xD;
f-   and she was not mistaken, for but a few moments after she got&#xD;
home, the door opened, and there entered one whom, at first, she&#xD;
could not think was the same fair youth whom she expected.&#xD;
When he left her, the rose and the lily had contended for empire&#xD;
upon his cheeks ; now, exposure had bronzed them to manhood's&#xD;
hue, but there was the same buoyant step as he leaped forward,&#xD;
exclaiming, "My dear aunt Nancy !" Nothing more was needed&#xD;
than that well-remembered tone ; for, .&#xD;
"Oh the voice is known&#xD;
First from all else."&#xD;
- -s-&#xD;
Once more she embraced him. Again he was with her, atid&#xD;
she was happy. She had hardly welcomed him when in rtn&#xD;
Richard, closely followed by Miss Hoxie with Emma in h r&#xD;
arms ; the child calling out," How-do-ye-do, my own brother, my&#xD;
dear brother ?"  Emma was crying with astonishment and frig at&#xD;
at the turbulence of the scene around her ; and Miss Hoxie was&#xD;
screaming, "Get out of the way-let me come-let me s e&#xD;
him !" She walked, or rather waddled up to him, and hastily&#xD;
putting Emma from her, she caught him in her arms, then she&#xD;
held him at arm's length, and, after gazing at him intently a mo-&#xD;
ment or two, she turned to Miss Stanley, "Well," said she, lie&#xD;

glad to see you ! Now sit down !"  Stooping to take up Emma,&#xD;
lie obeyed her, not without a smile at the strangeness of her&#xD;
gring.   She observed the smile : " And what are ye laugh-&#xD;
mg for ?" said she ; " that's the way with all of ye : ye go to&#xD;
foreign parts, and, instead of learning manners, ye come back to&#xD;
laugh at old folks."&#xD;
Oh no, Miss Hoxie, you are mistaken. I hope you don't&#xD;
think I would laugh at you !"&#xD;
"Well! now hold your tongue, and don't go to telling a lie&#xD;
to make it better, for it will only make it worse."&#xD;
lie knew her too well to say any more, and, taking a seat by&#xD;
his aunt, with Emma on one knee and Richard by his side, he&#xD;
was soon absorbed in asking questions and listening to rephies&#xD;
concerning every thing immediately relating to all that had hap-&#xD;
pened during his absence.&#xD;

\WnIE thus enjoying his society, hoping to be that evening&#xD;
olin- with him, the door opened, and Mr. Witherington and&#xD;
family entered ; and scarcely had the conversation resumed its&#xD;
social turn, when it was interrupted again and again by the en-&#xD;
trance of the former acquaintances of Jared, until the room was&#xD;
filled to overflowing. For he was a general favorite ; and the&#xD;
news of his coming had quickly spread through his circle of&#xD;
friends, most of whom were impatient to greet him on his ar-&#xD;
rival.  Though  Miss Stanley was disappointed in not being&#xD;
able to have him alone with her on the first evening of his arri-&#xD;
val, vet she was astonished at the improvement of his conversa-&#xD;
tional talents. Before lie left her, except to those with whom&#xD;
he was on terms of intimacy, he was reserved and shy ; now he&#xD;
was free and animated in conversation. Though he had been&#xD;
literally the hero of the evening, he bore his-part through it with&#xD;
modest, but with perfect freedom from embarrassment. Ap-&#xD;
parently at home, at whatever turn the conversation took, he&#xD;
had an answer for all. lie gave a lively description of the dan-&#xD;
grs and delights of the sea. He spoke of the glories of the&#xD;
rising and the setting sun-the beauties of the moonlight ocean&#xD;
&#xD;
., EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPIIANS. o&#xD;
-and then of the tedium of the sailor's life in a calm. Then,&#xD;
y     ere his audience began to weary, he made them thrill with hor-&#xD;
ror as he related the terrible struggles of the ship in a storm,&#xD;
t'    and a severe conflict which they had with a pirate vessel on the&#xD;
t      way. To one, he would relate an anecdote which would con-&#xD;
$      vulse all in the room with laughter ; to another, he would turn&#xD;
and tell some incident of his voyages which would make the&#xD;
eyes of the more tender suffuse with tears, and sadden the coun-&#xD;
tenances of the more stern. But all was natural and uncon-&#xD;
strained. And though he never presumptuously took the lead in&#xD;
conversation, yet, when he spoke, all hung upon his words.&#xD;
Miss Stanley gazed upon him in wonder ; her heart was too full&#xD;
to question him. She looked her delight, and was mute.&#xD;
At length the company dispersed. But it was long after&#xD;
'.     midnight had sunk upon the earth, when those two separated.&#xD;
And she was gratified by his telling her that it was her precepts&#xD;
before he left home, and her letters afterwards, which had inci-&#xD;
ted him to improve every spare moment in the cultivation of&#xD;
his mind, and enriching it with so varied a store both by read-&#xD;
ing and observation.&#xD;
The next morning he went to see Mr. and Mrs. Chapman.&#xD;
He found her seated by the fire reading. But Richard and&#xD;
Emma were there before him ; for Richard had made a very&#xD;
earnest and successful application to lis aunt to go and apprise&#xD;
her-whom he considered one of his best friends-of the arrival&#xD;
of a brother, of whom he had already learned to be proud;&#xD;
and as he had insisted that it would do Emma good to take a&#xD;
little walk, Miss Stanley had entrusted her to his care.&#xD;
How shall I describe Mrs. Chapman? For she was then in&#xD;
her sixtieth year, and to say she was beautiful might excite a&#xD;
smile in some of my youthful readers ; but I might make use of&#xD;
the expression, without fear of ridicule, to all those who rank&#xD;
expression as one of the principal requisites of beauty, for her&#xD;
countenance was what you might imagine a saint's to be. And&#xD;
even those who sought for beauty only in regularity of feature,&#xD;
might trace the remains of it in her bright blue eye, her Grecian&#xD;
nose, her high forehead, and her yet sound and regular teeth.&#xD;
A     She greeted the youth with that mild and maternal expression&#xD;
which so universally finds the way to the heart; inquired into&#xD;
the details of his voyage, and then, laying her hand on his arm,&#xD;
and looking anxiously into his face, as if fearing what his answer&#xD;
~   might be-" And how," said she, "has the soul prospered?&#xD;

est searching, but imperfectly acquainted with the secret work-&#xD;

length upon this subject than is warrantable in the warmth of a&#xD;
tirst meeting, after so long an absence. But I hope I have said&#xD;
nothing which you will not readily excuse, in consideration of my&#xD;
age, habits, and regard for your best welfare."&#xD;
"Instead of my having any thing to excuse, my warmest&#xD;
feelings of gratitude are yours; and I am rejoiced to find that I&#xD;
have awakened so warm an interest in your heart."&#xD;

I&#xD;
I&#xD;

"Let us, then, take a walk in the garden to see my children,&#xD;
as you used to call my flowers."&#xD;
"Gladly ; and I can prove to you that I did not forget you in&#xD;
my absence ; for while in Liverpool, I made a collection of seeds&#xD;
for you of a considerable number of plants, which you had not,&#xD;
and which I admired ; and I have a beautiful specimen of stone-&#xD;
crop at aunt Nancy's, which I brought from thence expressly&#xD;
for you."&#xD;
"I thank you. Such are indeed sweet remembrances, and&#xD;
such as I need not assure you I shall cherish, both on account of&#xD;
the giver and the gift ; but how shall I repay you for the trouble&#xD;
they must have cost you ?"&#xD;
"Think of me sometimes while admiring them; for I would&#xD;
take much more trouble for such a reward."&#xD;
"Surely you have learned to flatter since you left us."&#xD;
"I never flatter those whom I esteem; and to prove to you&#xD;
that what I have said is no flattery, I will ask a yet bolder boon:&#xD;
sometimes in your prayers remember me."&#xD;
She held out her hand ; he took it and pressed it respectfully&#xD;
to his lips, but said no more upon the subject. They spent more&#xD;
than an hour admiring the flowers ; after which, remembering&#xD;
that he had other friends to visit, he took his leave.&#xD;

JARED's next visit was to Mr. Witherington's. He found the&#xD;
young ladies amusing themselves with a letter which Lucy had&#xD;
that morning received from an admirer of hers. They were so&#xD;
absorbed in laughter, that for some time all he could learn of the&#xD;
cause of it was, that Lucy had received a billet-doux from Dr.&#xD;
Blustermeath. But who Dr. Blustermeath was, he was at a loss to&#xD;
conjecture. He supposed that he must be a new resident, as it&#xD;
was a name with which he was wholly unacquainted.&#xD;
"Oh !" said Lucy, at length, "just wait an hour or two and&#xD;
you will probably see him ; for he promises to be here this morn-&#xD;

Not at all. I can reject him just as well in your presence ;&#xD;
and as the lesson may be a useful one to you, I beg you would&#xD;
stay and relieve me from the irksomeness of a private interview ;&#xD;
and I can give you another reason, he is quite anxious to see&#xD;
you.''&#xD;
" To see me&#xD;
" Yes, you ; and why not ?  Indeed, I suspect that your arri--&#xD;
val had something to do with this precious epistle."&#xD;
" Why so&#xD;
Ye terday he was here, and I told him of your arrival, and&#xD;
lie asked me many questions concerning you, which I took pleas-&#xD;
ure in anwering. And I must confess that I praised you rather&#xD;
extrava antly. When he asked me if you had gained the cit-&#xD;
addl of my hiart, instead of answering the question, I. merely&#xD;
blushed, and hung down my head, with the mischievous design&#xD;
f wishing to see what effect it would have ; and I presume this&#xD;
ltt 'r is the effect, for he begins by referring to you."&#xD;
Do It me see this famous epistle.''&#xD;
Sh handed him the letter, and he read the following:&#xD;
My Al) l I) MI -s Ia e'v&#xD;
N N t bin_ alel1nger to bear the torturing thought that&#xD;
that iresuiiin  roung man, your cousin Stanley, may bear off&#xD;
the pri,  f  o'r inimitable heart, and determining that at least&#xD;
he should not gain it without a struggle. I propose myself as a&#xD;
tndidate in opposition to him. I declare you to be the queen&#xD;
of my afietion , and the only one of your sex in the great arena&#xD;
upon which the luminary of day casts his beams to whom I&#xD;
could surrender my libertyv-; but to you I am anxious to be a&#xD;
slhve, and, if vou will accept my heart and hand, and join your&#xD;
fate to mine, I pledge myself to you that you shall not only con-&#xD;
trol all my actions, but even all my thoughts. You are suffi-&#xD;
ciently acluaiitsd with me not to render it necessary for me here&#xD;
to enlarge upon my character. I have never scrupled to unfold&#xD;
it to vou. I will call this morning and receive from your beau-&#xD;
tiful m uth the fiat of my fate, and until I see you, live upon&#xD;
the hope that it may be most propitious to my dearest hopes.&#xD;
.A dieu for a few moments, which suspense and anxiety will&#xD;
l n-then to indescribable bounds, as is always the case when I&#xD;
am absent from you.&#xD;
"Your ardent admirer,&#xD;
"AUGUSTUS BLUSTERMEATIL"&#xD;
ie handed back the letter.  "A  singular being he must&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
surely be; and now I suspect I am as anxious to be acquainted&#xD;
with him as he can be with me."&#xD;
"And how do you intend to act towards him ?"&#xD;
"If that letter is at all characteristic, I shall endeavor to flat-&#xD;
ter him into a better opinion of me. But here is some one com-&#xD;
ing, and I suspect it is him."&#xD;
"What does he look like ?-an eel-skin drawn over a broom-&#xD;
stick ?"&#xD;
"Yes, somewhat. He has on a narrow-brimmed hat, from&#xD;
which peeps dark-brown hair."&#xD;
"Oh, his wig !-but I beg pardon ; go on."&#xD;
"A blue coat with light buttons, a white vest, blue pants,&#xD;
and unbrushed brogan shoes ; no gloves, but in his hand a gold-&#xD;
headed cane, which he flourishes back and forth, as if keeping&#xD;
time to his own anxieties. In short, he is altogether a singular&#xD;
mixture of a dandy and a sloven."&#xD;
"You have hit his character. Good morning, doctor," she&#xD;
continued, as he entered the room; "permit me to introduce&#xD;
you to my~much-esteemed cousin, Mr. Stanley, of whom you&#xD;
have so often heard me speak."&#xD;
The old man looked upon Jared as if he would gaze him into&#xD;
stone, and, instead of stepping forward to meet the advances of&#xD;
the youth, he sat, or rather dropped down upon the chair near-&#xD;
est him without speaking.&#xD;
But Jared, true to his determination of flattering him, began&#xD;
thus: "I feel myself peculiarly fortunate, Doctor Blustermeath,&#xD;
in meeting you so soon after my arrival, as, from what I had&#xD;
heard of you, I was quite desirous to see you."&#xD;
"Heard of me !" said the old man, his countenance brighten-&#xD;
ing with pleasure ; "and pray tell me from what quarter you&#xD;
heard me spoken of ?"&#xD;
"And do you think that you are so little known, or have so-&#xD;
few friends, that no one speaks of you ?"&#xD;
"No, I hope that I am not entirely unknown or un-&#xD;
thought of."&#xD;
"By no means ; and even were you personally unknown,&#xD;
were you to be once seen, pardon me if I say that your appear-&#xD;
ance is such that you would not be soon forgotten. I presume&#xD;
that you are of English descent ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I believe my grandfather was from Liverpool."&#xD;
"I thought so. I was acquainted with a Mr. Blustermeath,&#xD;
of Liverpool, one of the most wealthy merchants of the city.&#xD;
Lords and ladies contended for the honor of his acquaintance.&#xD;
He is about your size, and resembles you so much, that it&#xD;

startled Ie when I first saw you. You must certainly be re-&#xD;
Ia tedt&#xD;
I have no doubt of the relationship," interposed Lucy.&#xD;
" Dstor Ilustermeath, I would advise you to take a trip over&#xD;
to se your relative.&#xD;
Culd I have a companion," he replied, "as agreeable as&#xD;
ty v dviscr, I should not hesitate."&#xD;
" Bfr, vu decide upon going or staying, I will give you a&#xD;
letter which may have some effect upon your resolution," and so&#xD;
saving, she placed in his hands his own letter, upon which she&#xD;
had written.  " Miss Witherington regrets that she has made so&#xD;
favorable an impression upon the author of this, as she can nev-&#xD;
er, under any circumstances, reciprocate such sentiments in the&#xD;
slightest degree."&#xD;
lie read what she had written, and sat for some moments in&#xD;
mute wonder that he could be thus refused: then rising, neither&#xD;
the po)liten~ss of Lucy, nor the good-natured pity of Harriet,&#xD;
could induce him to stay. lie was evidently angry, as well as&#xD;
astonished at being discarded ; but though he bowed coldly to&#xD;
the ladies, there was more cordiality in his how to Stanley ; and&#xD;
now, as he left the room, he appeared to be the only individual&#xD;
in it with whom he was not angry.&#xD;
CIIAI'TER    XI.&#xD;
Strange fondness of the human heart,&#xD;

Strange that the words we know are art,&#xD;

A rrw days after, George Witherington accosted Stanley upon&#xD;
meeting him with-" Did you know that you had made a con-&#xD;
quest of old Dr. Blustermeath? He told me yesterday that he&#xD;
had met you at my- father's, and, to use a sailor's phrase, he was&#xD;
struck all aback at seeing you ; that you were a much handsomer&#xD;
young man than he expected to see ; and that he found you one&#xD;
of the most agreeable young men that he ever saw."&#xD;
Vive la flatterie !" exclaimed Jared; "'tis the same all the&#xD;
world over. The old and the young-the sensible and the fool-&#xD;
ish-the miserable and the happy-the rich and the poor-no&#xD;
matter w hat may be the rank, or situation, or sex,-all are&#xD;
moved by flattery !"&#xD;
" Such are not your real sentiments, surely ?"&#xD;

-Crail thyae      gat that it must be administered in&#xD;
different qualities andquantities to different persons. Some you&#xD;
must only pelt with roses, others you may daub  th hon&#xD;
but I hold .it a truth that no one can gainsay, that there is not&#xD;
the mortal living who cannot be moved by flattery, and that any&#xD;
one by using it judiciously might always move others to their&#xD;
wil- s                    designs never fail of their accom-&#xD;
plishment; for, as you succeeded so well in the case of the old&#xD;
doctor, I presume you are an adept in the art."&#xD;
"Unfortunately I have not learned to use it when I need it.&#xD;
I can flatter for my own amusement, as I did in the case you&#xD;
cite. The doctor had taken a prejudice against me that I thought&#xD;
c might easily remove b the means I used, as I knew that it was&#xD;
perfectly unfounded. But when it is necessary to use flattery,&#xD;
in order to be of service to myself, or to make any one act justly&#xD;
towards me, it is too revolting to every principle of independence&#xD;
with whirh I am blessed, or cursed, for me to make use of it;&#xD;
but I believe, that had I that smoothness of tongue and servility&#xD;
o   inde which would permit me to make every one think that I&#xD;
of mi     with true ffection, and would make me flatter the&#xD;
qualities which they knew they possessed, extol all their virtues,&#xD;
excuse all their faults, and such vices as were too glaring to ex-&#xD;
cuse entirely, gloss them over with such palliating circumstances&#xD;
as  take from them what was offensive-then I think that I&#xD;
might turn man or woman to my will."&#xD;
You give rather a contemptible view of human nature."&#xD;
"It is, alas!1 as I have found it. I am young in years, but in&#xD;
experience I am at least middle-aged; and the more I see of&#xD;
mankind, the more frail I feel our nature is."willyet&#xD;
"I regret to hear you say so ; but I hope that you  ye&#xD;
think mankind more upright than to be so easily oeominten-&#xD;
"As to the uprightness of many individuals, at least inine&#xD;
tion, I do not doubt, for there are hundreds who must first be&#xD;
oled to believe that the cause is not wrong before they will engage&#xD;
in it; but a true flatterer can convince them of that-they can&#xD;
interest the feelings, and thus blind the reason; and in such&#xD;
cases, unless the grace of God be showered down upon him or&#xD;
her thus tempted to guard them from the snare, I think no one&#xD;
cn withstand the insinuating poison, if cautiously and artfully&#xD;
can wtsadteusu&#xD;
directed."&#xD;
"Tell me how it should be pointed to succeed."&#xD;
"Always to that quality in which the victim wished to excel&#xD;
all others  and if it happens to be one in which the person&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
head leaning on his hand, and so profoundly engaged with his&#xD;
own thoughts, that he had not heeded the entrance of his visitor.&#xD;
s        He was in the undress uniform of the United States army-his&#xD;
face would betoken him to be about twenty-seven or eight ; but&#xD;
-      perhaps it was grief which had bowed his form with that pecu-&#xD;
liar stoop, which is seldom given by other cause, and which&#xD;
seems rather unexpected in a soldier. He started as Stanley&#xD;
pronounced his name.&#xD;
" Ah, Stanley !" said he, "I am heartily glad to see you, and&#xD;
you are one of the very, very few, to-whom I could now say so&#xD;
with any sincerity."&#xD;
"I should not suppose," said Jared, "that you were one to&#xD;
speak insincerely ; but you must not abate the joy that I feel in&#xD;
seeing you interested in any one, when I tell you the purport of&#xD;
my visit ; for I have come to ask a favor of you; but before I&#xD;
propose it, I want you to guarantee to me your consent."&#xD;
"I can scarcely suppose that you could possibly ask a favor of&#xD;
me, which I could refuse. You have too often relieved me of&#xD;
myself, and lightened my thoughts, for me to behave as churlish&#xD;
-i      towards you as I do towards others."&#xD;
:Y        " Why, then, have you permitted  e to welcome you to my&#xD;
=       home, and to introduce you to the members of my family, which&#xD;
render that home so dear to me&#xD;
"I can only plead to you the same excuse which I have so&#xD;
often made use of-my disincliniation for society, and my unfit-&#xD;
ness for it."&#xD;
"You are not unfit for it. On the contrary, you must be sen-&#xD;
sible that if you chose to exert the talents which God has given&#xD;
you, you would always be hailed with pleasure by any society&#xD;
into which you might be introduced ; and, to use the freedom of&#xD;
a friend, this morbid sensibility to deficiencies which only exist&#xD;
in your imagination, and this cankering melancholy in which you&#xD;
indulge, will lead you to an early grave. You must shake it off,&#xD;
and if you trust where you ought, and lift your heart above, in-&#xD;
stead of bowing it to the earth, believe one who somewhat early&#xD;
in life has proved it true, that 'Earth has no sorrow that God&#xD;
will not heal;' but I came not here to moralize, but-&#xD;
"Oh, stop not ! I love to hear you speak thus. It was hear-&#xD;
ing such sentiments from your lips, and seeing you act up to&#xD;
them, which first led me to seek your society-to take an inter-&#xD;
est in you, and to feel that there was yet one of my species with&#xD;
whom I might have some kindred feelings. Go on! Speaking&#xD;
thus you soothe a saddened soul, and minister-to a broken heart.&#xD;
" But I came to-night with a far different object in view.&#xD;

I told you that I had come to ask a favor, and if I mistake not&#xD;
you have promised to grant it, There is an assembly in town&#xD;
to-nit: I am going, and I came to beg you to accompany me.&#xD;
("1i, ask some other boon ! do not ask such a one as that!&#xD;
You know not the pain that I should suffer were I to grant it.&#xD;
I know your motive, you think that I can enter into the gayety&#xD;
of the scene; but you are mistaken. Do not urge your request."&#xD;
" Then you refuse to grant the only favor that I ever asked,&#xD;
after you had promised to grant it? I thought that what you&#xD;
oace promised you always performed. I regret that I am mis-&#xD;
taken inyou, even in the slightest point."t&#xD;
"If you insist upon the fulfilment of my promise I will accom-&#xD;
pa nvvyou. I must stipulate, however, that I may abstain from&#xD;
"Asy ou please; but I  sopegthat you will remain in the dan-&#xD;
cing-roront, and let us depart together."&#xD;
lie then inquired at what time it was fashionable to attend,&#xD;
and learning that the time had nearly arrived, he immediately&#xD;
began his toilet, and at about a quarter past ten o'clock the&#xD;
two friends proceeded to the assembly-room. It was a beauti-&#xD;
ful room, and brilliantly lighted. As they stood together and&#xD;
gazed upon the young and the gay before them, Captain Linton&#xD;
turned to Jare and observed that he had never seen such a col-&#xD;
lection of beauties, and that, though Newport had long been&#xD;
famous for its handsome ladies, yet he had never supposed that&#xD;
so many could meet at a public ball whom one might pronounce&#xD;
beautiful.&#xD;
A gleam of joy shot athwart the countenance of Stanley at the&#xD;
compliment paid his town's-women; but it instantly vanished as&#xD;
uis eve met that of his friend ; for instead of his face being lighted&#xD;
up with pleasure, more than his usual melancholy pervaded every&#xD;
feature. As Jared was about to reply, his arm was touched by&#xD;
asyo    a   o       - id schoolmates, who told him that he&#xD;
was commissioned by Miss Witherington to lead him captive to&#xD;
her feet. "Tell her," said he, that I will go a willing captive&#xD;
without being led," and turning to Captain Linton, he asked him&#xD;
if he wished to be introduced to one of the belles of the city?&#xD;
"011, excuse me !" said lie, "it is sufficient for me tougaze&#xD;
upon stars at a distance, without being near enough to be im-&#xD;
mersed in their rays."&#xD;
Jared went alone ; but before he reached the spot where his&#xD;
cousin sat she had left to dance, and not feeling disposed to join&#xD;
them in the amusement, he took a'vao nt seat and awaited her&#xD;
return ; and as he gazed upon the fair creatures before him, he&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.&#xD;
could not help assenting to his friend's remark ; but among all&#xD;
that he saw, there was none there whom he thought more wor-&#xD;
thy of admiration, on account of mere personal appearance, than&#xD;
his cousin Lucy. Her beauty was of that kind which seemed&#xD;
peculiarly fitted to the place, and=gas heightened by every&#xD;
circumstance of the scene. He was still admiring her when she&#xD;
returned to her seat. She playfully reproached him for absent-&#xD;
ing himself so long, and then asked him why he did not bring&#xD;
with him that melancholy-looking man who was standing by&#xD;
him ; "for," said she, "I think he must be an oddity, and you&#xD;
must know that it is my passion to attach such animals to my-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"You must not make sport of my friend," he replied; "and I&#xD;
think you would find it rather more difficult to attach him than&#xD;
you suppose."&#xD;
"The more difficult it would be, the greater the honor ! I'&#xD;
insist upon an introduction. What is his name ?&#xD;
"Captain Linton, of the United States army, at present upon&#xD;
furlough."&#xD;
"Captain Linton, that sounds well! You must introduce&#xD;
him now."&#xD;
"I fear that I cannot, as he prefers distance where ladies are&#xD;
concerned. I have already endeavored to persuade him to per-&#xD;
mit me to introduce him, ancl he declines."&#xD;
"You make me more and more anxious to become acquainted&#xD;
with one so different from the rest of the world; make one effort&#xD;
more. Tell him that I wish to be acquainted with him."&#xD;
He accordingly returned to Captain Linton; but even this ar-&#xD;
gument was of no avail. "Tell her," said he, "that I would&#xD;
not willingly sadden a moment of the existence of one so fair and&#xD;
beautiful, and for her sake I decline the invitation. But you&#xD;
must excuse my staying here any longer. Will you call to see&#xD;
me to-morrow morning, about ten o'clock, and suffer me now to&#xD;
depart ; it only saddens me to remain." So saying, he turned&#xD;
and left the room.&#xD;

cast around; and I wish you would give me some talisman by&#xD;
which I may preserve the charm even when you are not by to&#xD;
insure its power."&#xD;
So saying, they joined the dancers; and as Jared had early&#xD;
learned the power of making successful efforts to repress all ex-&#xD;
pressions of his feelings, when he was aware that they were per-&#xD;
ceptible to others, he commanded from him all appearance of&#xD;
sadness, and at once became the gayest of the gay. Miss Wither-&#xD;
Sington flattered herself that it was solely her influence which had&#xD;
so transformed him, for she was not aware that he had long tried&#xD;
to hide his feelings from the general eye, and that he would have&#xD;
made the same effort, and with equal success, as soon as he be-&#xD;
came aware that they were mirrored upon his face, even if she&#xD;
had been far distant; but it is generally the case that those ac-&#xD;
customed to homage, expect it from all who come within their&#xD;
influence, and attribute all the actions of those around them as&#xD;
so many acknowledgments of their sway.&#xD;
But he made no demonstrations of the remembrance of his&#xD;
friend to her again that evening, though he left before the party&#xD;
had generally began to disperse; but after he left, he gave free&#xD;
scope to his natural thoughts, and it was long ere they permitted&#xD;
him to sleep ; and when he slept, the visions of the evening were&#xD;
repeated and exaggerated, so that his slumber was uneasy and&#xD;
unrefreshing. He awoke the next morning with the exclamation&#xD;
upon his lips, What can Linton want with me? I shall be glad&#xD;
when the time arrives to visit him ; and just at that time he en-&#xD;
tered the room.&#xD;
" Ahl! Stanley," said Capt. Linton, "like yourself, always&#xD;
punctual! How did you spend the evening after I left you ?&#xD;
"Had you seen me, you would have thought me the lightest-&#xD;
hearted creature in the room.&#xD;
"And why were you not ?"&#xD;
x=            " For several reasons ; but I believe the most weighty one&#xD;
among them was your noble self."&#xD;
"I owe you an apology for leaving so abruptly, but I dreaded&#xD;
an introduction to any one there, for I knew that then I could&#xD;
not even feign mirth ; for only gazing upon it led-me into reflec-&#xD;
tions but little fitted for the place. But perhaps it was my par-&#xD;
ticularity in naming the time for our meeting this morning, which&#xD;
clouded your joy."&#xD;
"Yes I"&#xD;
"Well, my friend, I spoke to you last evening with the inten-&#xD;
tion of telling you my whole history this morning ; but I sat up&#xD;

&#xD;
late last night with the design of putting it into some form and&#xD;
only the dwelling upon sornecircumstances in thought, so much&#xD;
ngitated me, that you must excuse me for deferring it some time&#xD;
longer. I was unwilliancr to suffer you to introduce me toyour&#xD;
relatives, while you could give no other account of me than now&#xD;
you can  but vet I find myself unequal to the task of opening&#xD;
wounds (if which time has but blunted the severity. Are you&#xD;
willing to take me a little longer upon trust? You spoke truly&#xD;
when you said, that this morbid melancholy which I cherished&#xD;
would lead me to an early grave ; but before I die, or when I&#xD;
am dead, you shall know all the cause which so depresses me,&#xD;
whose only hin~,ringr of early pride is in being able to call Jared&#xD;
Stanley his friend. I can tell you now," he continued, waving&#xD;
his hand as he saw Stanley about to reply, " that nothing dis-&#xD;
honorable has ever cast a shade upon my character. Of that&#xD;
perhaps, my being continued in the army, and the peculiar in-&#xD;
d(ulagnce that I meet with from my superior officers, in being&#xD;
allowed long and frequent furloughs, is sufficient proof. I am&#xD;
th  only child of Robert Linton, formerly a lawyer of Philadel-&#xD;
phia, and though he is now numbered with the dead, yet there&#xD;
are many there who knew him, and those who were most intimate&#xD;
with him are the loudest in his praise. And my sainted mother-&#xD;
the poor, the sik, and the destitute are those who could tell you&#xD;
best where were her daily walks. Look upon her lovely face !"&#xD;
and he took a miniature from his bosom and held it towards his&#xD;
fiend as le spoke. " Does it not speak truly of one who would&#xD;
minister to the distressed and relieve the wretched?  Perhaps&#xD;
were she alive, she might pour balm into the lacerated bosom of&#xD;
her son .  He leaned back in his chair and covered his face with&#xD;
his hands, but Jared could see the veins of his forehead swell,&#xD;
and hear his breath come fast and thick. " Alas !'" said he, I&#xD;
wrong thee by the seltish thought, my mother !" In a few mo-&#xD;
ments he subdued his feelings.  " tanley," said he, with a sad&#xD;
smilef are you wilhingwit b so imperfect a knowledge of me, to&#xD;

mother, would have entirely supplied the loss; but' I was too&#xD;
old when my mother (lied, to transfer all the love which my&#xD;
heart had garnered up for her, to my devoted aunt ; but let us&#xD;

CHAPTER       XIV.&#xD;
But art thou thus indeed alone,&#xD;
Quite unberriended-alunknown 1&#xD;
And hast thou then His love forgot,&#xD;
Who formed thy frame, and fixed thy lot ?-CosnDER.&#xD;
TuouGH the interview related in the last chapter had been dif-&#xD;
ferent from what Jared had hoped, it had not been a disagreeable,&#xD;
though it was a sad one. He ha'd long wished to know some-&#xD;
thing particular concerning his friend, for though he had inferred&#xD;
from his conversation that he was, like himself, a parentless wan-&#xD;
derer upon earth, yet this was the first time that he had ever&#xD;
given him any direct information of himself. He was glad too,&#xD;
hat he had at last consented to visit him at his own home; and,&#xD;
at the same time, to account for his reluctance to have done so&#xD;
before and he thought that if any one could have any effecttin&#xD;
infusing cheerfulness into his heart, that Miss Stanley was the&#xD;
person to do it; and Mrs. Chapman, to whom he intended intro-&#xD;
ducing him, might give him another example of patience in bear-&#xD;
ing the ills of life.&#xD;
.The two friends were met at the door by Emma, who claimed&#xD;
her accustomed place in Jared's arms. He took her up, and pro-&#xD;
ceeding to the parlor he introduced his friend to his aunt, an&#xD;
also to Mrs. Chapman, whom he had the pleasure to find sitting by&#xD;
the fire knitting, which employment gave assurance to his prac-&#xD;
tised eye, that she was there for the day. They both kindly wel-&#xD;
comed Capt. Linton.-&#xD;
c"Did    ou know," said Miss Stanley, "that I am almost dis&#xD;
posed to arraign you before this present tribunal, for your long an&#xD;
inexcusable refusal to wait upon us fair ladies, at our own homes?"&#xD;
"Iwould beg not to be arraigned," said he, "did I think that&#xD;
my acquittal would depend upon the defence that I might be able&#xD;
to make, but I read mercy so plainly written upon your counte-&#xD;
nances, that if I am ever to be tried for this offence, this is the&#xD;
time and place I should choose."&#xD;
"You don't know how inexorable we might prove: perhaps, as&#xD;
a punishment, we might condemn you to sojourn amongst us ir&#xD;
a longer period than your patience could endure; but if you or-&#xD;
offend no more in the same way, we will put off your trial for-&#xD;
ever : but your not coming sooner has made us believe you very&#xD;
hard-hearted."&#xD;
"And why ?"&#xD;

"No! for them we are debtors to the Giver of all good. They&#xD;
are talents intrusted to our care, and we are accountable to the&#xD;
great Proprietor for our diligent use of them. The command is,&#xD;
as you know, 'Occupy till I come.'"&#xD;
"You give me rather new ideas of my duties; but though&#xD;
they militate against my general practice, yet I believe you&#xD;
right."&#xD;
"Look here !" said Emma, thrusting a kitten which she held&#xD;
in her hand almost into his face, in order to attract his attention,&#xD;
which she had been in vain attempting to do for some time by&#xD;
antics of all kinds. "Is not my kitten a beauty ?"&#xD;
He was unprepared for such an interruption, and a repulsive&#xD;
answer rose to his lips ; but when he looked upon the child, it&#xD;
was quickly changed to one of sympathy; she was so frail that&#xD;
she looked as if a summer's breath, if suffered to blow harshly&#xD;
upon her, might waft her to another sphere, and she looked so&#xD;
lovingly upon the kitten which she still held in her hand, as she&#xD;
repeated the question, that it at once awakened his kindly feel-&#xD;
ings, and in a short time she was clambering upon his knee, and&#xD;
entertaining him with the whole history of her cat.&#xD;
Thus passed the day, in rational converse with the ladies and&#xD;
Jared,-in fondling Emma, who did her best to amuse the&#xD;
"sorry man," as she called him, or in watching Richard, who&#xD;
was truly a lover of mischief, and who appeared to be at once&#xD;
the life and the favorite of the household. While he was in the&#xD;
house, scarcely a moment passed in which the frolicsomeness of&#xD;
his disposition was not apparent. At one time he would be&#xD;
teasing Emma, then archly doing something to gain a smile from&#xD;
the ladies, then some prank against Jared, to get into a romp if&#xD;
Jared took any notice of it; and he eyed Captaia Linton askance,&#xD;
as if he only waited for a better acquaintance to make him take&#xD;
his share ; but yet, when he was led into conversation, he dis-&#xD;
played a depth of thought and a shrewdness, which bade fair to&#xD;
render him superior to his fellows, should he live to manhood,&#xD;
and Captain Linton could not help feeling interested in him, and&#xD;
he took pleasure in engaging him in conversation, in order to&#xD;
fathom his young mind ; and there were few who knew and did&#xD;
not take an interest in him. He was rather small of his age, his&#xD;
fair complexion was perfectly colorless, and to see him standing&#xD;
still, looking downwards, one might have taken him for marble,&#xD;
such an entire air of repose breathed over him ; but if he raised&#xD;
his eyes, and unveiled them from their long lashes, the resem-&#xD;
blance vanished-there was too much life in those bright blue&#xD;
eyes to belong to aught inanimate !&#xD;

In vain through beauty, fortune, wit,&#xD;
For happiuness we trace ;&#xD;
It dwells not in the faithless smile,&#xD;
That brightens Lucy's face."&#xD;
" IHAIRIET, just fasten that bandeau," said Lucy Witherino-&#xD;
ton to her sister, as she sat before her glass, arranging her hai-.&#xD;
"Pshaw ! don't you see that you have put it too low upon my&#xD;
forehead-and now it is as much too high. Oh, let it alone ! and&#xD;
call Susan here, and let me see if she can find out where I want it."&#xD;
" Let me try once more," said Ilarriet.  "There! I am sure&#xD;
you can find no fault with that, it lies so beautifully between&#xD;
those curls and flowers ; but tell me, Lucy, why are you so very&#xD;
particular in your dress to-day? here have you been before your&#xD;
class for two whole hours, and have just finished your head-&#xD;
(lre-c ; but really it now pays you for your trouble ; for I have&#xD;
rarely seen it arranged so becomingly; but it is a mystery to&#xD;
me why you are so anxious to look well to-day."&#xD;
- Dii not cousin Jared promise me that, if possible, he would&#xD;
bring Captain Linton to dine here to-day ; but, at all events, he&#xD;
would bring him round in the afternoon?"&#xD;
"And what of that&#xD;
"Simply because he is different from men generally, and in-&#xD;
stead of fluttering round me the other night at the assembly, as&#xD;
ther did, he even refused Imty invitation to come. I admire his&#xD;
independence, and it would delight me to make it bow to mine."&#xD;
" Al   believe me, sister dear, you will never chain that man&#xD;
to  our triumphal ear; ho has some corroding grief that will&#xD;
forbid him to lve.'&#xD;
' Arnd I tell you that I will chain him, and should he continue&#xD;
here six weeks, I will have the offer of his hand."&#xD;
" And if you do, will you accept it ?"&#xD;
Why will you ask me such foolish questions-what has that&#xD;
to do wat hi5 making me the offer ? I wish you would let the&#xD;
fut ure take care of itself&#xD;
- But, seriously, Lucy!&#xD;
" )o stand out of my light! I can never betray pne of my&#xD;
thoughts to you, but you begin with your seriouslys ; what dif-&#xD;
fir"nce can it make to you whether I discard or accept him ?"&#xD;
" Are you not already engaged ?"&#xD;
"And what if I am?     You know that is merely an engage-&#xD;
ment of convenience, which I intend to break if I should chance&#xD;
to have an offer that I like better."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I did not know that you intended to break it. I should con-&#xD;
sider such a contract too sacred to be so lightly broken."&#xD;
"I suppose so, Miss Prude ! but you need not suppose that I&#xD;
need your lectures, or directions, to make me regulate my con-&#xD;
duct."&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, Lucy, I did not intend to make you an-&#xD;
gry. I thought I might as well know if I was to prepare my-&#xD;
self for a martial brother-in-law."&#xD;
"You won't know, now, at least. I tell you again that I wish&#xD;
you would call Susan here ; there you stand and see me endeav-&#xD;
oring in vain to suit myself with this dress, and you will neither&#xD;
help me yourself, nor call her to do it."&#xD;
"You did not ask me to assist you !"&#xD;
"Could not you see that I needed assistance without my ask-&#xD;
ing you? No, you shall not do it now," continued she, as her&#xD;
sister advanced towards her. "Call Susan, I say !"  Harriet&#xD;
turned and left the room, and in a few moments the maid ap-&#xD;
peared. "Your father has come, Miss Lucy," said she, "and if&#xD;
you don't hurry, you won't be ready for dinner.&#xD;
"And what if I am not !" said Lucy. "Is it in your place&#xD;
to tell me what I must do? I sent for you to dress me, not to&#xD;
instruct me in my duty ;" but notwithstanding her stern reproof,&#xD;
the announcement of her father's arrival, hastened her prepara-&#xD;
tions ; for Mr. Witherington's children stood in fear of commit-&#xD;
ting the slightest act that could incur his displeasure; for, as in&#xD;
their childhood, nothing could prevent the punishment which&#xD;
was the certain follower of his anger, so in their more mature&#xD;
years, nothing could shield them from his reproof.&#xD;
At the summons to dinner Lucy descended to the dining-&#xD;
room; but neither of her hoped-for guests were there, and it by&#xD;
no means dispelled the frown upon her brow to find them absent.&#xD;
"Lucy," said Mr. Witherington, "Judge Ormond and his&#xD;
wife and sister are in the city, and you must call upon the ladies&#xD;
this afternoon ; I told him you would do so."&#xD;
"Not to-day, father, if you please ; it is too cold."&#xD;
"You will hardly freeze, if you shut up the carriage well, with&#xD;
your cloak and pelisse both on, and the foot-stove inside to keep&#xD;
your feet warm."&#xD;
"Let Harriet go without me, father. I do not wish to go&#xD;
out this afternoon."&#xD;
"I am not aware that I asked if you wished to go; I am not&#xD;
in the habit of asking favors of my children."&#xD;
"But, father, I do not feel well enough to go out so cold an&#xD;
afternoon as this."&#xD;

days which are so often felt during the winter of a New England&#xD;
eliiate, while a damp northeaster seems to penetrate every fibre&#xD;
f ih-- b dy .&#xD;
I wih, said Lucy, petulantly, " that the great folk would&#xD;

" I) you intend going with us to see ' the lions' this after-&#xD;

" N  I intend making the shortest possible call, and return-&#xD;

"Thank you, Harriet, for the thought ; that is just the thing.&#xD;
You can always think on both sides of the question."&#xD;
Thus they proceeded ; Lucy and George contending on almost&#xD;
every subject that was mentioned, and Harriet continually inter-&#xD;
posing as mediator. But they were very agreeably surprised&#xD;
wk-n they arrived at the hotel, to find none of those whom they&#xD;
came to visit at home. But the cold rendered Miss Lucy far too&#xD;
uncomfortable to permit her to regain her equanimity before&#xD;
they arrived at her father's door.&#xD;
CHAPTER       XVI.&#xD;
This life is but a mermaid's song,&#xD;
A crazy bark on stormy waves;&#xD;
And every gale that sweeps along&#xD;
Conveys us nearer to our graves.-RAY.&#xD;
WhEN they arrived at home, Lucy was gratified to find her&#xD;
cousin and Captain Linton there. He was more talkative than&#xD;
usual, for Lucy, bent upon conquest, addressed her conversation&#xD;
principally to him; and as his politeness compelled him to do&#xD;
something towards supporting the conversation, it had the ef-&#xD;
fect of drawing him out of himself, until, by degrees, he became&#xD;
agreeably cheerful. As what he said was characterized by good&#xD;
sense, and showed a depth of intellect more than is usually dis-&#xD;
played by gentlemen in their conversation with ladies, the im-&#xD;
pression which he had already made upon the capricious beauty&#xD;
was deepened. Seeing a piano in the room, he requested Lucy&#xD;
to sing, adding, that a love for music was one of his passions.&#xD;
She was herself a brilliant performer, and readily complied with&#xD;
his request. Her voice was a very powerful one, and well&#xD;
trained, but rather deficient in softness. But as her sister's was&#xD;
low and soft, and as their voices harmonized well from their&#xD;
constant practice of singing together, she was now too anxious&#xD;
to excel to neglect so important a coadjutor. Together they&#xD;
sang song after song ; but Lucy had the mortification to see&#xD;
Captain Linton often watching her sister's face, though he&#xD;
scarcely glanced at her. She was not conscious that her anxiety&#xD;
to please made itself conspicuous to him, and that he was conse-&#xD;
quently much more charmed with Harriet's perfectly natural&#xD;
manner. For it is always the nature of a man to feel contempt&#xD;
for a woman whom he sees make any advances to gain admira-&#xD;

hsvays at the same time feel flattered by the preference, and&#xD;
ent-mn the flattered'&#xD;
At l      ;nth .ared asked for the beautiful and simple song,&#xD;
SIdier, rest," &amp;amp;. ; and he was surprised to see Captain Linton&#xD;
ave the piano, and after walking very rapidly once or twice&#xD;
airos the room, leave it, and go out upon the balcony. He&#xD;
waited till the tune was tinihed, and then, begging to be excused&#xD;
a moment, he sought his friend,  lie found him standing at one&#xD;
nd of the balcony, supported by one of the columns, with his&#xD;
lips compressed, his eves fixed, but looking as if they would&#xD;
start from their sockets, and pale and livid as a corpse. Jared&#xD;
went up to him and took his hand ; he heeded it not. ie spoke&#xD;
t' hin, anil received no answer.  But not wishing to have a&#xD;
sent, ie went to the sideboard, and seizing a tumbler of water,&#xD;
i dashed about half its contents in his face. It had the de-&#xD;
sird effect-it awoke him to consciousness. lie gasped, and a&#xD;
moment after he took Stanley's hand.  " I thank you for your&#xD;
care of me 'sd he, " but I am ashamed thus to betray my&#xD;
want of self-command, even to you.  But that tune-the last&#xD;
time I heard it was from lips as fair, that are now cold in death;&#xD;
and now I am in the world alone, and she is-where?     But&#xD;
leay me, Stanley, leave me; I will return to you in a few mo-&#xD;
ments." And Stanley, thinking that it was best for him to be&#xD;
alone, returned to the ladies.&#xD;
What is the matter ." said Lucy, as he re-entered.&#xD;
Captain Lint'n was merely a little faint," he replied, " and&#xD;
I had to throw some water in his face. ie will return as soon&#xD;
as that on his clothes is dry."&#xD;
His -b ohes will not dry ; they will freeze on that cold bal-&#xD;
cony," said Harriet ; "go, Jared, and bring him in.  I sus-&#xD;
p)act the room  was too warm ; let us leave the door open a&#xD;
while.''&#xD;
Jared went again to the balcony, and telling his friend that&#xD;
the ladies supposed he had fainted from the warmth of the room,&#xD;
they returned together.&#xD;
He took a seat on the sofa, and Lucy soon seated herself near&#xD;
him. At her feet was a beautiful geranium ; she asked him if&#xD;
he understood the language of flowers.&#xD;
He replied that he did not, that there were not many flowers&#xD;
in a soldier's life ; and that, consequently, he had not studied&#xD;
what must ever prove to him a dead language.&#xD;
"I am studying it," said Jared, "and if I ever fall in love I&#xD;
intend by their means to express my passion."&#xD;
&#xD;

"And can you truly say," said Harriet, "that you have never&#xD;
felt the arrows of the wily god ?"&#xD;
"Most truly ; but I have seen so many beauties that, like the&#xD;
humming-bird, if I may compare myself to any thing so beauti-&#xD;
ful, I flutter around them too indiscriminately to fix upon any."&#xD;
"I hope," said Lucy, addressing Captain Linton, "that you.&#xD;
are not so ungallant as my cousin ?"&#xD;
"1 think," said Jared, "that you should rather complain of&#xD;
my excess of gallantry ; for do I not tell you that all the ladies&#xD;
are so lovely that I am unable to choose one as my Dulcinia?&#xD;
Beauty has given me an armor invulnerable to all the arrows of&#xD;
love."&#xD;
"Boast not, rash mortal !" said Lucy, with her finger lifted&#xD;
towards him in a threatening manner; "defy not the power of&#xD;
the wily god ! He will yet come upon you at a time when you&#xD;
expect him not ; he will pierce your heart, and lay you prostrate&#xD;
at the feet of beauty."&#xD;
"You should not risk your fame as a prophet with so little&#xD;
prudence, for I have already had my future destiny predicted&#xD;
by one of those strange beings called gipsies, which haunt merry&#xD;
England."&#xD;
Oh, tell us what he said," exclaimed Harriet.&#xD;
He smiled, but said nothing.&#xD;
"Do you believe in his prediction ?" said Lucy.  .&#xD;
"It was a woman that told my fortune," said he, evasively.&#xD;
"Do not evade our curiosity so cunningly," said Harriet.&#xD;
"You awakened it rather gratuitously, now it would be cruel in&#xD;
you not to gratify it. Did she make you believe that all she&#xD;
said was true ?"&#xD;
"I cannot tell," said he, "but I certainly do not entirely dis-&#xD;
believe her, for she predicted some things which have since hap-&#xD;
pened, as well as telling some that then were past."&#xD;
"What were they ?" persisted Harriet. "Tell us what she&#xD;
said."&#xD;
"She described my native town," said he, "with as much ac-&#xD;
curacy as if she had visited it; told me that I was an orphan-&#xD;
that I had one brother and one sister ; said that I had that day&#xD;
received a letter, and told me most of its contents ; said that it&#xD;
was the last time that I should ever see England-that my des-&#xD;
tiny was in a southern land-that at the south I should love,&#xD;
and in the south I should die-but that I should die young and&#xD;
unmarried."&#xD;
"And   do tell me," said Lucy, "how looked the weird&#xD;
sister."&#xD;

&#xD;
length of his first, and while thinking upon it he could not help&#xD;
contrasting his present with his former feelings : then he was&#xD;
full of hope ; unacquainted with human life and human char-&#xD;
acter, he saw only bright visions before him ; now, reality had&#xD;
cast its dampening shadow upon many a brilliant prospect, had&#xD;
sunk into nothingness many a fond imagining, and given him a&#xD;
sad experience of many evils of which before he had not even&#xD;
dreamed. his brother Richard was now anxiously looking for-&#xD;
ward to independence, without foreseeing how many troubles&#xD;
were concealed under the folds of its alluring garb; and it made&#xD;
him sad to think that even the joyousness of Richard might be&#xD;
changed to sadness, and the bright smiles that now so often il-&#xD;
lumines his countenance be blotted out by the frowns of care.&#xD;
There was another reason too why he should, go less joyously.&#xD;
When he went before he had a destined port: now he was going&#xD;
he knew not whither. All these thoughts were causes of anx-&#xD;
iety to him ; but yet, with the delicacy which always character-&#xD;
ized him, he endeavored to appear to his aunt cheerful and as&#xD;
full of hope as before.  He spoke with confidence of imme-&#xD;
diately procuring a situation on board some ship, and nothing&#xD;
indicated to a careless observer the unhappiness of his bosom;&#xD;
but the day before his departure he was surprised at his aunt's&#xD;
accosting him with-" Jared, why are you so sad? If you have&#xD;
any particular cause for being so, why not make me a sharer?&#xD;
Am I not worthy of your confidence ?"&#xD;
"Most worthy, my dear aunt ; but why do you think that I&#xD;
have any thing to confide? Is it not enough to make me sad&#xD;
to know that I am so shortly to leave you?  I thought before&#xD;
I ever left you, that I loved you as much as I could 'love any&#xD;
one now upon this weary world, but this winter's sojourn with&#xD;
you has endeared you to me in a still greater degree, and I find&#xD;
you so superior to those with whom I am shortly to mix, that I&#xD;
somewhat dread the contact."&#xD;
"Think not, my dear Jared, thus to blind the eyes of affection.&#xD;
I have watched you closely, and I have observed a restlessness&#xD;
that proceeds not from a mind at ease. What is it that thus&#xD;
distresses you?  Is it the uncertainty of your getting into imme-&#xD;
diate employ ?"&#xD;
"Such have been somewhat my thoughts, but I thought that&#xD;
I had hidden my anxieties from you."&#xD;
~ "I would not, my dear boy (you must suffer me to call you&#xD;
so, though you are now verging upon manhood), I would not&#xD;
counsel you to turn back after you have put your hand to the&#xD;

STANLEY went with Capt. Linton to his room, where the first&#xD;
question he asked him after they were seated was, What was his&#xD;
present object and where his destination?&#xD;
"I have only the object to get my own living in the lot which&#xD;
I have chosen ; and any place where I can attain that object is&#xD;
my place of destination."&#xD;
"How should you like to try a steamboat instead of a ship?&#xD;
I have an uncle residing at' Pittsburg who is, I believe, largely&#xD;
concerned in that kind of property, and if you should wish to&#xD;
try freshwater with land in sight and on both -sides of you, in-&#xD;
stead of the boundless ocean, I shall use my influence in your&#xD;
favor. I have written a letter to him which, should your applica-&#xD;
tions elsewhere fail, you can make use of, as I flatter myself that&#xD;
it would not be unavailing. Don't return me any thanks," he&#xD;
continued, "as it pains me for you to do so; you would not,&#xD;
could you be sensible under how many obligations I feel myself&#xD;
to you and our beloved aunt, for to call her thus, and to think&#xD;
of you as the brother of my soul, is a privilege which I cannot&#xD;
deny myself; for, in truth, my soul is knit to yours as David's&#xD;
was to Jonathan's. Never having a brother, I knew not what&#xD;
fraternal affection was until I knew you, but now the remem-&#xD;
brance of it will sweeten the remainder of my life. Before I&#xD;
knew you, life was a load which I longed to cast away-now I&#xD;
would fain prolong it, because I know my death would give you&#xD;
pain."&#xD;

her sister; I cannot admire one who so evidently puts forth all&#xD;
heyr charms-&#xD;
'Thefruit that fails without shaking,&#xD;
Is rather too mellow for me.'"&#xD;
"I am glad you feel so, for I did not know if you remained&#xD;
here what effect the efforts which I saw she was making to cap-&#xD;
tivate you might have, and I would not like to see you united."&#xD;
"You need not fear it ; I have once loved too deeply ever to&#xD;
love again, but that is a theme too painful for me to touch upon&#xD;
now.   Let me tell you this before we part-the precepts of&#xD;
yourself, of your aunt, and of Mrs. Chapman, have sunk deeply&#xD;
into my heart, and I hope they will bring forth their blessed fruit&#xD;
hereafter."&#xD;
"I have with joy for some weeks perceived that you spoke not&#xD;
so despondingly as heretofore, but I attributed it to the soothing&#xD;
effects of time and new subjects of thought."&#xD;
"The latter it certainly is ; for the excellent friends whom I&#xD;
have mentioned have taught me the sin of repining at my griefs,&#xD;
as I have done. They have taught me to rest my cares on Him&#xD;
who careth for all the children of men, and pointed to the only&#xD;
source from whence I could draw comfort."&#xD;
"Then while you remain here I commend those friends to&#xD;
your care, and you to theirs ; I can assure you that you have&#xD;
awakened a deep interest in the heart of each of them: aunt&#xD;
Nancy this morning thanked me for introducing you to her, and&#xD;
expressed much anticipated consolation at your visits after I shall&#xD;
have left. Even Miss Hoxie says that it is worth while for one&#xD;
to be like you, and she frequently advises Richard and myself to&#xD;
take you as a pattern: you completely won the old lady's heart&#xD;
the night you waited upon her home from uncle Witherington's,&#xD;
and she will never forget it."&#xD;

"If your arguments are good, I will at least listen with defer-&#xD;

"Yes, I do: you do not like the sea ! Don't smile so mean-&#xD;
ingly-I know you do not. You are yet young, andby leaving&#xD;
it now, you might yet choose your mode of life."&#xD;
"I know of none, my dear sir, which would not abound in&#xD;
trials-I know of none which would not require self-command&#xD;
and self-denial."&#xD;
"You are right, Jared," said Mrs. Chapman, "and as rational&#xD;
beings, as heirs of immortality, as living for eternity, we must&#xD;
learn to distinguish the shadow from the substance; learn volun-&#xD;
tarily and resolutely to deny ourselves all those alluring and dan-&#xD;
gerous indulgences which militate against our real good, and&#xD;
with ,firm step and steady eye pursue unswervingly the path&#xD;
which duty points out to us; and unless you could enter at once&#xD;
upon some other walk of life which you would greatly prefer, I&#xD;
think you are decidedly right to continue in the one you have&#xD;
chosen. It may be that your choice was a hasty and unfortunate&#xD;
one, let it then teach you not again to take an important step&#xD;
without being first well aware where it will lead; but as you&#xD;
,A        observed, you would find self-command and self-denial equally&#xD;
necessary in every other station. Always remember, however,&#xD;
that 'no cloud can overshadow a true Christian, but his faith&#xD;
will discern a rainbow in it;' and I hope that you will ever keep&#xD;
in view the great end of life, and remember that the righteous&#xD;
Dispenser of good and evil sends every trial of the faith and pa-&#xD;
tience of his dependent creatures for their benefit, and if wisely&#xD;
improved, they ultimately tend to their spiritual and eternal&#xD;
welfare."&#xD;
"I fear that I have not wisdom thus beneficially to improve&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"When we lack, we arc directed by St. James to ask of Him&#xD;
who giveth liberally, and upbraideth not."&#xD;
"My dear Elizabeth," said Mr. Chapman, "I expected you&#xD;
for my coadjutor against this foolish boy, and you have turned&#xD;
all your powers in his favor, and I suppose that, deserted as I&#xD;

ever intend to leave a sailor's life, do it now ; for believe me, you&#xD;
will find it more and more difficult ever year you live : I am&#xD;
selfish in wishing you to do it; for I want you'here, I am not&#xD;
willing to see you so seldom ; but I will say no more to you now&#xD;

&#xD;
always forbore, for when that was the case, unless she interfered,&#xD;
Miss Hoxie's wrath became so violent at the slightest provoca-&#xD;
tion, that she would be so agitated as to take an hour or two to&#xD;
regain composure. Richard's last demand, however, irritated her.&#xD;
"Take it-take all that is on the table. Here, now take the&#xD;
coffee-pot and wait upon yourself, and I hope that will please&#xD;
ye. Come, Emma dear !" said she, snatching up the child with&#xD;
one hand, and her plate with the other. "I hope ye'll never be&#xD;
like them;" and so saying, she was waddling out of the room,&#xD;
when Jared thinking it was time to appease her, jumped quickly&#xD;
between her and the door-&#xD;
"Now, Miss Hoxie," said he, "you know that I don't love to&#xD;
pour out my own coffee: please to go back and pour me out one&#xD;
more cup.&#xD;
"And if I do, I can't suit ye !"&#xD;
"Oh, yes, I guess you can, and it is the last time that you&#xD;
will have to try for a long, long time. Come, make friends with&#xD;
Richard and I. Don't let me think when I am on the watch at&#xD;
sea, with my heart full of home, that the last time I saw you,&#xD;
you were angry with me."&#xD;
"Well, go to yere seat; I can try to pour it out. Now sit&#xD;
down and see if I can suit ye this time."&#xD;
She began to pour it out ; but she was still enough excited to&#xD;
make her talkative, and as she performed the operation, she con-&#xD;
tinued talking, as if her troubled thoughts escaped her without&#xD;
her will: "Yes," said she, "I must put in a whole spoonful of&#xD;
sugar, and that won't do, 'and if I were to put in the whole I&#xD;
believe ye'd still ask for more ; for it's always more, more, with&#xD;
all of ye. And now comes the cream, and I s'pose I must put in&#xD;
half that's in the cream-pot (suiting each action to her words), or&#xD;
there won't be enough of that either ; and now there is hardly any&#xD;
room for the coffee, and I s'pose now it won't be strong enough:&#xD;
well, there must be some fault. Here, take it," said she, scream-&#xD;
ing out to Jared, "and see if that suits ye."&#xD;
"Exactly right," he replied; but fearing, unless the subject&#xD;
was changed, that something might be said by Richard or him-&#xD;
self again to irritate her, he asked her what he should bring her&#xD;
when he returned again.&#xD;
"Bring yourself," said she. "I'm sure that's enough !"&#xD;
"I intend to do that; but what shall I bring you ?"&#xD;
Nothing !"&#xD;
"Miss Hoxie, suppose I should bring a wife !"&#xD;
"Ye look like getting a wife, now dont ye?  Ye talk about a&#xD;
wife, and ye're hardly out of petticoats yet."&#xD;

EMASALY, OR THE ORPHANS.               5&#xD;
school to a lady who taught not far from her house, and from&#xD;
the mildness of whose character she thought that she might in-&#xD;
trust her with her frail pet. Emma was not at all pleased with&#xD;
the idea, but Miss Stanley had early taught her that though will-&#xD;
ing to yield in all minor points, yet when she absolutely said any&#xD;
thing, it must be ; there was no appeal from her decision, and&#xD;
unless she submitted without force, that even that would never&#xD;
be wanting to enforce obedience. She consequently rarely dis-&#xD;
obeyed her aunt; but the fear she had of her was so joined with&#xD;
love, that a wish expressed by Miss Stanley was frequently&#xD;
enough to make her readily comply with any requisition, even&#xD;
after others had tried force in vain to accomplish the same ends.&#xD;
Feeling thus, she got ready to go to school upon the appointed&#xD;
morning, where her aunt conducted her. When they entered&#xD;
the room, they found a number of boys and girls differently em-&#xD;
ployed. Miss Waitstill Trott, for such was the teacher's name,&#xD;
called her to take a seat by her, upon a small low bench which&#xD;
was made only for the accommodation of two. It was then&#xD;
vacant, and Emma appeared quite pleased with the idea of hav-&#xD;
ing that seat ; for she had whispered to her aunt, as soon as they&#xD;
entered, to know if she might sit there. Soon after her aunt&#xD;
left, a little girl cane in and took her seat upon the same bench.&#xD;
Emma whispered her to get up; but as the child feared her&#xD;
teacher more than she did any new-comer, she paid no attention&#xD;
to the command. After repeating it several times in a low voice,&#xD;
she at length spoke it so loudly as to attract the attention of the&#xD;
teacher, who turned round and asked what she wanted.&#xD;
You gave me this bench," she replied, "and this girl won't&#xD;
get off."&#xD;
"Is there not room enough for both of you ?" said Miss Trott.&#xD;
"I don't like the looks of this girl, and I want her to get offE"&#xD;
"But that was her seat before you came, and she must sit&#xD;
there still."&#xD;
"Let me get off then, and go sit yonder," said Emma,&#xD;
pointing to a long bench, at one end of which sat several girls,&#xD;
though the other end was unoccupied.&#xD;
"No," replied Miss Trott, "I choose for you two to sit where&#xD;
you are."&#xD;
Emma knew that there was no appeal from the authoritative&#xD;
tone of the teacher, but she was resolved not to be thus deprived&#xD;
of what she considered her own right, the sole possession of the&#xD;
bench, and she thought she would see what could be done by&#xD;
4         her taking the matter into her own hands, and she began imme-&#xD;
di~ately to pinch the little girl upon the arm ; and when she&#xD;

told me to take that bench, and sit upon it, and Mary Smith had&#xD;
no right to it."  Finding that she could not prevail upon her to&#xD;
yield, Miss Trott sent her home. So soon as she got into the&#xD;
house she went immediately to Miss Stanley, and told her every&#xD;
circumstance of her day's experience, not forgetting the cat and&#xD;
kittens, and as she would not have condemned her own beha-&#xD;
vior in another, she did not attempt to excuse it in herself.&#xD;
Miss Stanley, however, soon made her think and feel differently,&#xD;
and after representing to her how culpable she had been, she in-&#xD;
sisted upon her telling both her teacher and the little girl on the&#xD;
morrow that she was sorry.&#xD;
It was a difficult task for one so obstinate voluntarily to confess&#xD;
herself wrong ; but Miss Stanley knew that if she could induce&#xD;
her to say that she would do so, that she would quell every re-&#xD;
bellious feeling rather than break her promise.  At last she&#xD;
yielded to the persuasion of her aunt, and agreed to say so, if&#xD;
her aunt did really think that she was wrong.&#xD;
The next morning was a bright and sunny one, and Emma&#xD;
tripped off gayly to school, and as soon as she entered the room&#xD;
she walked up to the teacher, and said to her, "Aunt Nancy&#xD;
says that I acted very naughty yesterday, and I suppose I did,&#xD;
as she says so ; and if I was naughty I am sorry, and will not act&#xD;
so again." She then went up to Mary Smith, who was already&#xD;
seated upon the contested bench: "I will not pinch you any&#xD;
more," said she, "and if you will sit by me I will sit down, and&#xD;
we will see which can be the best girl." She then quietly took&#xD;
her seat, and in a few days she and Mary were firm friends ; and&#xD;
though she often forgot her proposal of seeing which would be&#xD;
the best girl, yet it was the last time that she ever assaulted one&#xD;
of her schoolmates. She continued at this school for four years,&#xD;
and it was one of those institutions where children are taught to&#xD;
use their fingers in all sorts of needlework, at the same time that&#xD;
they are storing their minds : but while she was there, her teacher&#xD;
complained much of her loving her book too well, and a stolen&#xD;
book had often to answer for a deficiency in the accomplishment&#xD;
of a task ; and afterwards, in speaking of her, she said that she&#xD;
was the only child that she ever taught to whom certain pun-&#xD;
ishment offered no hindrance to the prosecution of a design; but&#xD;
that upon her it had no effect whatever, and if she ever wished&#xD;
to deter her from doing any thing, her only certain means was&#xD;
by representing its being wrong, and thus gaining her promise&#xD;
that she would not do it; but when that was once gained she&#xD;
felt perfectly easy, as she knew that no temptation could induce&#xD;
her to falsify her word. Her feebleness gave her physical cow-&#xD;

'lit: manner, t Euana Stanley were blunt even to brusquerie.&#xD;
Sh' never yii jiid a fault to the person who conunitted it,&#xD;
though in their absence she would often try to excuse them ; and&#xD;
to any one who asked her opinion of their own actions, their man-&#xD;
ners, or their sentiments, she would express herself with the&#xD;
stnofe freedom and the sante regard to truth as if she had been&#xD;
only thinking about them in the solitude of her own chamber,&#xD;
without any of the softening which speaking face to face generally&#xD;
giveh to faults or follies. Consequently, she had but few friends,&#xD;
she generally offended most of those who asked her opinion&#xD;
concerning themselves; for there are few of us who can bear&#xD;
to have ourselves held up to our own view exactly as we appear&#xD;
to those who view us truly, without suffering friendship to inter-&#xD;
pose its thick veil of partiality between us and our errors.  But&#xD;
through tuns severe to the faults of others, yet sl rwas a true&#xD;
ft iend wherever she professed the name ; and there were few .&#xD;
difficulties she would not encounter, few hardships she would not&#xD;
attempt to perform, for one to whom she was attached; but her&#xD;
love was too entire, too devoted, ever to be a source of happiness&#xD;
to herself : and even in childhood she felt the want of a return&#xD;
of such live as she gave. She would sometimes ask her aunt&#xD;
why her little playmates did not love her as well 'as she did&#xD;
them; and when her aunt would ask her why she thought they&#xD;
did not, she would reply, "Because they sometimes neglect me;&#xD;
they prefer others to me; and some whom I have dearly loved&#xD;
have accused me of unjust and unkind acts; and I could not do&#xD;
so to one of them."  When not more than seven years old she&#xD;
would seek an unoccupied room, and weep as if she would break&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.             63&#xD;
her young heart at the idea, which some trivial word or act of a&#xD;
playfellow had forced upon her, that she was not loved with the&#xD;
love which she would herself feel for some object of her youthful&#xD;
affection. It was the one dark spot in her existence, but like&#xD;
most of those exacting natures, she would resent the most trifling&#xD;
slight, and meet the person who gave it with cold disdain; and&#xD;
perhaps, as soon as they were out of sight, she would shed bitter&#xD;
and agonizing tears over the decay of that friendship which a&#xD;
word of explanation from herself might have renewed, but which&#xD;
she was too proud to give. "No, I will not seek her love," she&#xD;
would say to herself ; "she shall never know that I care for it.&#xD;
If she does not love me enough to seek an explanation it shall&#xD;
never come from me ; I do not want her love, if I have to stoop&#xD;
to gain it." Thus forgetting that she was asking of her friend&#xD;
an act which she would not herself commit ; and at the very&#xD;
same time that she was making these resolves, and acting up to&#xD;
them, the canker of grief was eating into her soul, for the loss of a&#xD;
possession which she prized above all others, and that was human&#xD;
love. And it was most unfortunate for her that such a blot on&#xD;
her mental organization could not be effaced ; for this under-cur-&#xD;
rent of her heart was laid bare to no one, and no one suspected&#xD;
its existence. Miss Stanley thought that she often acted re-&#xD;
vengefully, and she tried to eradicate that evil, but she struck&#xD;
not at its root-pride; and that was suffered to grow and spread,&#xD;
and harden a heart which was overflowing with love to every&#xD;
thing about her. Indeed, her whole character, as far as it was&#xD;
developed, was a strange mixture of tenderness and sternness.&#xD;
By those who did not know her, and by some who thought they&#xD;
knew her well, she was often accused of want of feeling, because&#xD;
she showed no mercy unless she thought that mercy merited,&#xD;
because she never professed friendship when she had it not, and&#xD;
seldom showed it by words at all, and because she never feigned&#xD;
a tear ; for whenever they gushed from her eyes, they came from&#xD;
the deep well-spring of her heart; and they never flowed upon&#xD;
any occasion in the presence of a fellow-being, when her self-&#xD;
command could restrain them. But though thus never affecting&#xD;
the softer feelings, she would administer to the wants of a dog&#xD;
whom she had never seen before ; beg for a horse if she saw him&#xD;
beaten ; stand for hours to pull up weeds and give them to a&#xD;
neighbor's pig, because he seemed so much to enjoy the pleas-&#xD;
ure of eating; and be kept awake by the lowing of a cow, and&#xD;
even shed tears of sympathy if she thought it was mourning for&#xD;
its calf.&#xD;
Miss Stanley she loved, as such natures as hers are capable&#xD;

&#xD;
of loving; but even to her she did not show the extent of her&#xD;
affection. When she was sick, Emma would bid her good&#xD;
night without appearing to feel any thing more than common ;&#xD;
but when she was alone in her own bed, she would wet her pil-&#xD;
low with her tears at the thought that her aunt might die. Em-&#xD;
ma was irritable ; for what child, who has ill health from her&#xD;
cradle, is not? Her temper was like a whirlwind, it took every&#xD;
thing in its wrath ; but when it had passed, it left her calm as if&#xD;
wrath had never entered her bosom ; but Miss Stanley was the&#xD;
only one who had a love for her sufficiently indulgent to excuse&#xD;
the fault. She was wild as the fawn of the forest, and when not&#xD;
depressed by bodily suffering, her spirits were buoyant as the&#xD;
air she breathed. 1er natural propensities had but little curb&#xD;
from her aunt, and she would not submit to the rule of any other&#xD;
person.&#xD;
"You will make that child a complete pest, Nancy," said&#xD;
Mrs. Witherington to her one day ; "indeed, she is that al-&#xD;
ready."&#xD;
"1 hope not," replied Miss Stanley.   "But poor, sickly&#xD;
child, she seems to have no one to love her but me, and she&#xD;
suffers so much bodily pain that I cannot help indulging her&#xD;
sometimes."&#xD;
"Sometimes! you never restrain her that I see."&#xD;
"Well, let her be as happy as she can while I am able to in-&#xD;
dulge her; I may not live long, and I fear after my death she&#xD;
would not meet with much allowance for her faults."&#xD;
"Why not cure her of them ?" continued Mrs. Witherington.&#xD;
"Just look at her !" she exclaimed, as at that moment she ran&#xD;
past the window with a kitten in her arms, and a dog at her&#xD;
heels ; "she is the greatest romp I ever saw ; I would advise&#xD;
you to put pantaloons on her, and make a boy of her at once, or&#xD;
else confine her a little more to the house."&#xD;
"And have her fade and die," said Miss Stanley, mournfully.&#xD;
" Pshaw ! there is no reasoning with you, Nancy ; you always&#xD;
bring up the child's ill health as an answer to all argument."&#xD;
"Did you ever see a more delicate flower ?"&#xD;
"That's no reason that you should permit her to be such a&#xD;
romp. Mr. Witherington says that she is perfectly ungovernable&#xD;
now.&#xD;
"Not to me. But it is useless arguing about it, Martha, for&#xD;
I do not intend that she shall ever have it in her power to re-&#xD;
proach me with undue severity, and as far as possible I intend&#xD;
to heighten all her pleasures. I hope I shall not be excessively&#xD;
indulgent, and that I shall not injure her by over-kindness."&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"But you are injuring her every day."&#xD;
"Let us say no more about it, Martha, for I don't think that&#xD;
I can alter my mode of education."&#xD;
IIJAPTER     XXIII.&#xD;
"Were every one's internal care&#xD;
Imprinted on their brow,&#xD;
How many would our pity share&#xD;
Who claim our envy uow !"&#xD;
A SHORT time after the departure of Jared, there was a party&#xD;
given at Mr. Witherington's, in honor of Judge Ormond and&#xD;
family, who were to take their departure in a few days. Cap-&#xD;
tain Linton had not only received a note of invitation, but Lucy&#xD;
herself had honored him with a personal one, to which she would&#xD;
take no excuse ; but notwithstanding his feeling somewhat flat-&#xD;
tered at her earnestness, he did not attend. Such parties had&#xD;
for a long time lost all attractions for him. But now his health&#xD;
was visibly declining, and he felt that the exposure which he&#xD;
must suffer, and the pain consequent upon it, would not be com-&#xD;
pensated for by attending one of Mr. Witherington's brilliant.&#xD;
parties ; and of all those who were there, none felt his loss ex-&#xD;
cept the star of the night-the belle of the room-the fair Lucy&#xD;
herself ; for one of whose smiles many there would have felt hon-&#xD;
ored. Though she was as usual radiant in beauty, and carrying&#xD;
life and gayety, by turns, into every part of those crowded rooms,&#xD;
yet, as every successive guest was announced, her heart beat&#xD;
quick, hoping to hear that one loved name; and her cheek&#xD;
would grow momentarily pale at each disappointment. It was&#xD;
that evening that carried the truth to her heart that she loved,&#xD;
and was not loved in return. Twice she left the guests and re-&#xD;
tired to her own room, to subdue the sadness which she felt was&#xD;
overpowering her, and to commune with herself ; and by the aid&#xD;
of all her pride, and every auxiliary which woman can call to her&#xD;
aid in such moments, to regain her gayety. And she nobly&#xD;
succeeded. Few could have supposed that her smiles were&#xD;
forced.&#xD;
A young lady, who was notorious for her envy of Lucy, by the&#xD;
name of Miss Dodric, came up to her, and began to compliment&#xD;
her upon her exuberant spirits that evening ; but at the same&#xD;
time she thought she might as well test the reality of them, or&#xD;
the truth of the rumor that the cold and indifferent Captain Lin-&#xD;
ton had won the heart of the gay coquette. "Where is Captain&#xD;
&#xD;

Linton ?" said she ; " I thought of course I should see him here&#xD;
to-night ; and after all I have heard of him, I have quite a great&#xD;
curiosity to see him."&#xD;
"If you feel very desirous," said Lucy, "you can go to the&#xD;
Episcopal church and see him in Miss Stanley's pew, and as he&#xD;
is quite a regular attendant there, you can have that pleasure&#xD;
every week."&#xD;
"Oh, I don't mean merely to look at him! I mean to converse&#xD;
with him. Do tell me where he is to-night."&#xD;
"At his room, I presume," said Lucy, in her coldest manner.&#xD;
"And why is he not here ?" persisted Miss Dodric.&#xD;
"Mr. Coleman," said Lucy, turning to a young man who&#xD;
stood not far from her, "I will thank you to step here a moment,&#xD;
if you are wholly unengaged." In a moment he was by her&#xD;
side.&#xD;
Are you entirely at liberty ?" said she.&#xD;
I am always at liberty to attend to any of Miss Withering-&#xD;
ton's commands," he replied, bowing as he spoke.&#xD;
"Then I will trouble you to attend to Miss Dodric to answer&#xD;
all her questions, for really I have not the time to spare from&#xD;
my other guests ; and should she wish to call upon Capt. Linton&#xD;
immediately, I will thank you to be her escort."  So saying, she&#xD;
moved off, leaving Mr. Coleman completely motionless with&#xD;
astonishment, and Miss Dodric as much overcome with mortifi-&#xD;
cation.&#xD;
But if Lucy on that night was rendered unhappy by the ab-&#xD;
sence of one, Harriet was proportionably blessed by the presence&#xD;
of another. Mr. Thorn was there ; he was a young lawyer from&#xD;
New Haven, and had of late paid more frequent visits to New-&#xD;
port than one might suppose his law business warranted ; and it&#xD;
was observed by the many who find watching their neighbors a&#xD;
more pleasant employment than watching themselves, that he&#xD;
never visited Newport without spending more time at Mr. Wither-&#xD;
ington's than at any law-office in town. lie was an attendant&#xD;
at the party, and Miss Dodrie said that when he came in he had&#xD;
a beautiful monthly rosebud in his button-hole which was soon&#xD;
transferred to Miss Harriet's sash, and placed near her heart as&#xD;
possible.&#xD;
It was true that he had brought that bud from New Haven&#xD;
to present to her whom he loved, and that he had guarded it&#xD;
with so much care upon the way, that it was yet fresh and&#xD;
lovely. When lie entered he found her sitting in a rather ab-&#xD;
stracted manner by a window. He had not seen her for a week,&#xD;
and she did not expect him, for her brother George had invited&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
67&#xD;
&#xD;
him without her knowledge. He spoke to her gayly, and the&#xD;
blushes which mantled her cheek led him to hope that he did&#xD;
not love in vain. He took his seat by her side, and, after con-&#xD;
versing with her for a few moments, he handed her the rose-&#xD;
bud. "Here," said he, "is what I would wish to be a true&#xD;
emblem of yourself-a rose just blooming into beauty, already&#xD;
so lovely that one would hardly dare to say that it could be&#xD;
more beautiful. So far the comparison is perfect; but this one&#xD;
is protected by a thorn from every thing but the rude winds of&#xD;
heaven ; for see, the thorn will wound all who too roughly touch&#xD;
its loved rose. Thus would I wish you to be guarded for life,&#xD;
by the Thorn at your side, from every thing but those afflictions&#xD;
which Heaven sends ; and even through them I would support&#xD;
and cherish you. If you will accept him by your side, then&#xD;
take the bud ; I shall need no other answer." With trembling&#xD;
hand she placed the bud in her girdle. A short time after he&#xD;
asked her to permit him to lead her to the piano.&#xD;
"Oh, no !" said she, "I could not possibly sing now."&#xD;
"But you could play, and I see some gentlemen are endeav-&#xD;
oring to persuade your sister to favor them with a song, and you,&#xD;
if they succeed, will be called upon as an auxiliary. By the&#xD;
way, what is the matter with Lucy to-night? I never before&#xD;
saw the least cloud of uneasiness upon her brow upon an occa-&#xD;
sion like this, when,.she could display herself to so much advan-&#xD;
tage ; but as I came in I met her, and she positively looked&#xD;
gloomy, and then when I saw you sitting here alone in the midst&#xD;
of the crowd as abstracted as if your best friend were absent, I&#xD;
did not know but I had mistaken the occasion of this assem-&#xD;
blage, and that the meeting was one of sorrow instead of fes-&#xD;
tivity."&#xD;
"I am not aware of any cause for Lucy's unhappiness. I&#xD;
think you must have imagined more than was real."&#xD;
"But yourself-there was nothing imaginary about you-&#xD;
what was the gloomy subject of your thoughts ?"&#xD;
"My thoughts were Thorny ; so ask me no more questions."&#xD;
"I thank you much for that admission, and in proof of my&#xD;
gratitude for it I will obey your injunction, though I am sorely&#xD;
tempted to ask you many-but hark ! there, Lucy has just com-&#xD;
missioned young Coleman to call you to her assistance."&#xD;
"Of course he would be her messenger ; I wonder how any&#xD;
man can bear to stoop as he does to my sister. She at times&#xD;
treats him with the utmost contempt, and always when he is&#xD;
near her, she employs him as a lackey to do her errands ; and&#xD;
what makes me despise him is, he appears to consider it an honor&#xD;

to bear her commands. See, how anxiously he is looking for&#xD;
me ! What would he do if he could not find me ?-ah ! he ap-&#xD;
proaches; he must have seen me. Now, watch his bows as he&#xD;
speaks."&#xD;
"Good evening, Miss Harriet (bow), I hope you are well&#xD;
(bow) ; indeed, you look charmingly (bow); I am commissioned&#xD;
by your sister to ask your assistance in a song (bow). May I&#xD;
have the pleasure to lead you to the piano (bow) ?"&#xD;
She gave him her hand, and suffered him to lead her forward.&#xD;
Her lover did not follow, wisely judging that his presence there&#xD;
would serve to confuse rather than to gratify her ; but his heart&#xD;
beat quicker as he distinguished the soft and tremulous notes&#xD;
which she warbled forth, from the louder but far less sweet&#xD;
tones of her sister. She sang, however, but two or three songs,&#xD;
when one of the gentlemen came up and asked for an overture,&#xD;
and after that for another, and thus she was enabled to escape,&#xD;
and she returned to the instrument no more that evening.&#xD;

While Pve thee before me&#xD;

No clouds can linger o'er mie-&#xD;
That smile turn, them all to light !-MooRE.&#xD;
WE will not dwell upon the scene of loneliness which the&#xD;
house exhibited after all the guests had departed ; but before&#xD;
the last one had departed, Lucy retired to her room, and left to&#xD;
Harriet the task of bidding the few late lingerers good night.&#xD;
When that was over, she also retired ; but what was her sur-&#xD;
prise to find Lucy sitting by the fire in tears. "Lucy, my dear&#xD;
Lucy," said she, "what is the matter ?"&#xD;
"Nothing."&#xD;
"Why, then, do you weep ?-are you sick ?"&#xD;
" What has happened, then?   Do tell me ; I can't bear to&#xD;
see you so distressed and not know the cause. Has any one&#xD;
hurt your feelings ?"&#xD;
"Hurt my feelings !" said she scornfully; "and do you think&#xD;
that Lucy Witherington would weep, because any one had hurt&#xD;
her feelings?  No ; she would revenge herself !"&#xD;
"What, then, makes you weep?    I beseech you to tell me."&#xD;
"Go to bed, Harriet, and let me weep."&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.            69&#xD;
But Harriet was too happy herself that night to be willing to&#xD;
see her sister apparently so miserable. Failing by direct in-&#xD;
quiries to find out the cause of her distress, she determined to&#xD;
mention every thing that she supposed might have a bearing&#xD;
upon it.  "I would like to know," said she, carelessly, "why&#xD;
Capt. Linton was not here to-night."&#xD;
"Oh, I beseech you," said Lucy, "not to mention his hated&#xD;
name. I invited him myself ; I urged him to come, and sent&#xD;
him a note of invitation myself ; and he has refused the whole."&#xD;
"Lucy," said Harriet, "has he any thing to do with your&#xD;
tears ?"&#xD;
But she answered not, she only continued to weep.&#xD;
"I am glad," continued Harriet, after a brief pause, "that he&#xD;
is going away so soon; George says that he told him that he&#xD;
should return to his regiment in about a week, and I. hope we&#xD;
shall see him no more: but let us leave that subject, Lucy, for I&#xD;
see it is most painful to you, and I will tell you some news about&#xD;
myself. Mr. Thorn proposed to-night: I have referred him to our&#xD;
father, and to-morrow he is to ask his consent."&#xD;
"Yes," said Lucy, "and you never took any pains to gain his&#xD;
love ; unless loving him, and trying to conceal it, be pains ;&#xD;
while I have spared no charm, no kindness, no flattery of which&#xD;
I was mistress, to captivate that obdurate Linton, and he has&#xD;
remained cold and unmoved, while I have lost my own heart in&#xD;
trying to gain his. I never believed before I knew him that I&#xD;
could love ; for though I have gained many a heart, and flirted,&#xD;
and flattered, and exulted at the conquests that I made, I never&#xD;
before felt a particle of the love that I feigned: but let us talk&#xD;
no more of it, Harriet; let us go to bed and sleep, if we can."&#xD;
While such were the circumstances in which the two young&#xD;
ladies found themselves on the night of the party, they had be-&#xD;
come somewhat the subjects of gossip to their guests; for Miss&#xD;
Dodric was too much mortified by Lucy's behavior towards her&#xD;
on that eventful night, to feel very agreeably towards any of the&#xD;
household. "Did you observe," said she, to one of her ac-&#xD;
quaintances whom she called upon the following morning, "how&#xD;
pleased Harriet Witherington looked after that young Thorn&#xD;
came in ?"&#xD;
"I did," replied Miss Beekam, "and I really believe that will&#xD;
be a match after all."&#xD;
"I don't believe any such thing, for, depend upon it, Thorn&#xD;
will never fancy that milk-and-water looking creature enough to&#xD;
propose for her."&#xD;
"Why, then, is he at her father's house so often? I think he&#xD;

<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6673-00000036"/>&#xD;
70          EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.&#xD;
is all devotion, and she appears to be sufficiently pleased with&#xD;
his attention."&#xD;
"Pleased I supposed she would be, with the attentions of&#xD;
one so fine looking and so rich ; but take my word for it, he will&#xD;
never propose."&#xD;
"I see no reason why he should not. To be sure, Harriet is&#xD;
rather a languid beauty when placed in close contrast with her&#xD;
sister, and I have seldom seen any one who would not be, for&#xD;
she is certainly brilliantly beautiful."&#xD;
"I must say, that I could never see any thing so very fascinat-&#xD;
ing about Lucy. Were you to say that she is haughty, I could&#xD;
readily agree with you."&#xD;
"I grant that at times she is very haughty and scornful, but&#xD;
we must excuse a little spoiling in the case of one who is so&#xD;
universally admired ; for I think it would have some effect upon&#xD;
any of us. Even you, condescending as you now are, might be&#xD;
made a little imperious by such excessive, general, and long-con-&#xD;
tinued flattery."&#xD;
"Oh ! I beg your pardon ! I was not aware that I was ad-&#xD;
dressing one of Miss Witherington's friends ; for they are so very&#xD;
few of her own sex, that I did not know that you enlisted your-&#xD;
self upon their scanty roll."&#xD;
"The fewness of their numbers would be no objection to my&#xD;
placing my name among them, but you are rather mistaken if&#xD;
you suppose me one of her intimate friends; for though we have&#xD;
each other's names upon our visiting lists, yet there are few of&#xD;
my acquaintances whom I visit less often than Miss Withering-&#xD;
ton, but I merely say of her what I think she deserves, and that&#xD;
I endeavor to do of any one."&#xD;
"Well, I must bid you good morning, for there is Mrs. Chap-&#xD;
man coming into the gate, and I have no desire to meet her."&#xD;
"Are you acquainted with her, Miss Dodric ?"&#xD;
"No, and I don't wish to be ; I have heard she was a saint,&#xD;
and I don't affect any of those saint-like characters, they are al-&#xD;
ways too gloomy for me."&#xD;
"Mrs. Chapman, I think, really deserves the name of saint ;&#xD;
but she is one of the most cheerful companions I ever saw. She&#xD;
fixes her thoughts too much above to let any thing depress her,&#xD;
and I would advise you to seek her society,'for I think it would&#xD;
be improving to any one, and to know her would dispossess you&#xD;
of any prejudice against the pious and the saint-like. So sit down&#xD;
and hear her converse for once ; you need not pursue the ac-&#xD;
quaintance if you are not pleased."&#xD;
"No, I thank you, 1 leave you two together: good morning."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
That glorious valley with its streams,&#xD;
And mounts on mount in clusters swelling,&#xD;
Mighty, and pure, and fit to make&#xD;
The ramparts of a godhead's dwelling.-MooRE.&#xD;
BUT perhaps my readers will inquire what has become of Jared&#xD;
all this time ; but we will let him speak for himself in the follow-&#xD;
ing letter, which he wrote to Capt. Linton about a month after&#xD;
his departure.&#xD;
From fared Stanley to Capt. Linton.&#xD;
"PITTsBURG, May 18, 18.-.&#xD;
"My DEAR FRIEND.-&#xD;
" When I arrived in New York I tried seversi ship-masters for&#xD;
a berth, and got half a promise that I should receive a berth&#xD;
from three of them ; but was at last disappointed in all, and&#xD;
finally resolved to take advantage of your kind offer, and proceed&#xD;
to this place, and present your- missive. I accordingly left New&#xD;
York on the third inst., arrived in Philadelphia on the fourth, left&#xD;
there the fifth, and arrived here the eleventh. I stayed but one&#xD;
day and a night in Philadelphia, and of course could not see&#xD;
much of it in so short a time ; this I regretted the more, for its&#xD;
being your birth-place gave it a superior charm; but even the&#xD;
partiality which this circumstance engendered could not make&#xD;
it, in my humble opinion, comparable to New York. The ex-&#xD;
treme regularity and sameness tires the eyes, and is not half so&#xD;
pleasing to me as the variety to be met with in New York.&#xD;
"As for the journey here it was very tedious and fatiguing:&#xD;
the roads are called good for this country, especially for the&#xD;
season ; but they would be extremely rough for New England.&#xD;
The stages are bad, and what they call the springs have not much&#xD;
more elasticity than a bar of iron.&#xD;
"Crossing the mountains I found worse than I expected, for&#xD;
instead of accomplishing it by crossing one ridge, as I supposed&#xD;
I should, I found it nearly a hundred miles from the foot of the&#xD;
Cove Mountain, which is the first hill we cleared, to the Laurel&#xD;
Hill, which is called the last of the mountains ; though there are&#xD;
many others on this side which are high enough to deserve the&#xD;
name, but they are detached from the main chain.&#xD;
The views from some of the peaks are very grand and ex-&#xD;
tensive, though not so rich as a more cultivated landscape. On&#xD;
every side you see mountains piled up in heaps, like the waves&#xD;

of the Atlantic, and in many places the valleys resemble the&#xD;
trough of the sea. The hills being covered with woods, and the&#xD;
glades few and small, so as hardly to be distinguished from the&#xD;
tps of them, give an idea of wildness to the whole scene, which&#xD;
is not without its beauties, though it has not the advantage of&#xD;
contrast to heighten its effect.sIopassed through several towns,&#xD;
and a great many villages, some quite neat, and others verythe&#xD;
shabby. The farm-houses in Pennsylvania, however, through&#xD;
whole State, are much the best that I ever saw; and te b-n&#xD;
are substantial even to a proverb, as some satirical writer ob-&#xD;
serves -' the y seem intended for the same purpose that the old&#xD;
woman planted the trees: for the good of posterity and the im-&#xD;
mortal gods.' I passed through a village in the valley called&#xD;
Bloody-run, from an Indian massacre, in which a creek was made&#xD;
to run red with the blood of the whites. The mountains which&#xD;
I crossed, you know, are called collectively the Alleghany ; but&#xD;
besides the ridge which bears that appellation, par excellence,&#xD;
there are the Love Mountain, Scrub Ridge, and many others&#xD;
with like names, which have been given to them by the wagon-&#xD;
ers. These hills and ridges, of which there are a great number,&#xD;
are not connected in straight lines, but thrown together without&#xD;
apparent regularity.&#xD;
Pittsburg is a pretty large place. The streets are well&#xD;
paved, and it bids fair, at some future day, to become the Bir-&#xD;
mingham of America. There are iron mines not far off, and all&#xD;
the hills in the vicinity abound in coal. There are already, sev&#xD;
eral iron-foundries, an excellent glass-factory a paper-mill, saw-&#xD;
mills, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;C. &amp;amp;c. The city proper covers a triangular plain,&#xD;
surrounded by hills, abruptly rising at the back of the town, and&#xD;
on the opposite banks of the rivers, giving it the form of a vast&#xD;
amphitheatre.  Standing on Giant's Hill, just on the edge of the&#xD;
town you have the Alleghany river at your right; the Monon-&#xD;
gahela, over which is thrown a fine bridge of seven arches, at&#xD;
your left, both rivers emerging from the mountains, and visible&#xD;
but a short distance. The Ohio before you, soon hides itself&#xD;
among the hills; and the city of Pittsburg lies at your feet.&#xD;
The whole is a fine view : and the long dark shadows thrown&#xD;
by the hills in the evening--the vapory clouds often seen hang-&#xD;
in  on their sides-and the lights here and'there seen breaking&#xD;
through them, give a romantic and pleasing effect to the scenery.&#xD;
"The magazine of what was once Fort Du Quesne, at the junc-&#xD;
tion of the rivers, is still standing. It is a small arched stone&#xD;
building with walls about four feet thick, and the earth around&#xD;
still retains traces of the ramparts.&#xD;
&#xD;

"I think I have faithfully fulfilled the promise which I made&#xD;
you, of giving you a minute description of my journey hither,&#xD;
and of Pittsburg as I found it, and it somewhat astonishes me&#xD;
thateyou have never travelled westward through your native&#xD;
State.                                          orntv&#xD;
"I found your uncle very agreeable and obliging. He received&#xD;
your letter with much pleasure, and professed himself particular-&#xD;
ly happy in being able to oblige you, or any of your friends.&#xD;
He has a steamboat which was launched yesterday, called the&#xD;
Fire-fly, of which I am to be clerk during the remainder of the&#xD;
season. I shall not leave here in a fortnight, and in that time I&#xD;
hope to receive a letter from you. Answer this as soon-as re-&#xD;
ceived, and I may get it before I leave; but if I do not it will&#xD;
be forwarded. Tell me when you leave Newport, and where&#xD;
you go, and give me the most minute details of yourself; for&#xD;
nothing you can write can possibly be uninteresting to your&#xD;
attached friend,                       JARED STANLEY.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
And is he gone? on sudden solitude&#xD;
How oft that fearful question will intrude;&#xD;

And now !  *    0*   0**&#xD;

ADOUT the middle of September following, Richard departed&#xD;
to seek his fortune in the sunny clime of Alabama, with the idea&amp;amp;&#xD;
that by the time he had attained manhood, he would have ac-&#xD;
quired a fortune. Thus is youth ever beguiled by sweet visions&#xD;
of the future, and it is only as it is led on step by step to prove&#xD;
their falsity, that it can be convinced that they are only illusions.&#xD;
After he had gone, Miss Stanley wandered from room to room,&#xD;
as if all light had left the house with her favorite; for having&#xD;
him always near her, his open disposition and his cheerfulness&#xD;
had twined themselves round her heart, and he had by insensi-&#xD;
ble degrees become her favorite of the three. Jared had been&#xD;
so long from her, and had acquired so much of the character of&#xD;
the man, that she had no longer those tender anxieties for him&#xD;
with which she saw him first set out from home. It is true that&#xD;
Emma was her pet; but she was too feeble to look upon in any&#xD;
other light but the one in which Miss Stailey often spoke of.&#xD;
her, as a delicate flower, which every blast threatened to destroy,&#xD;
and her aunt could not look forward to her companionship even&#xD;

for  single year ; but Richard had now attained his fifteenth&#xD;
ye r, and his character was sufficiently unfolded to display many&#xD;
virtues, and he had a manliness about him which had encouraged&#xD;
Miss Stanley to cherish the expectation, that he would be the&#xD;
prop and stay of her declining years. She had never thought&#xD;
of the possibility of his leaving her, until his suddenly-formed&#xD;
project in the spring preceding his departure ; and so fondly had&#xD;
she clung to the idea of having him always near her, that though&#xD;
she gave her consent for him to go, she still expected and hoped&#xD;
that he would at last relinquish his design, and she could not&#xD;
realize the thought that he was indeed going, until the dreaded&#xD;
morning of his departure arrived, and then, as she expressed it,&#xD;
had some one come and taken a limb from her body, the sep-&#xD;
aration could not have been more painful.&#xD;
There are some hopes to which the heart will fondly cling,&#xD;
until disappointment tears them rudely from our grasp, and Miss&#xD;
Stanley's belief that Richard would not leave her was one of&#xD;
these ; but when he had said farewell, when he had given her&#xD;
his parting kiss, and she had showered her farewell blessings and&#xD;
tears upon his head, when she missed his merry laugh, his buoy-&#xD;
ant step and cheering voice, then indeed she felt that her house&#xD;
had become most desolate. For a time she appeared to sink&#xD;
under the blow, and when her friends came around her to cheer&#xD;
her, her only replies to their soothing words were such as the&#xD;
following: "I shall never see him more. I have looked upon&#xD;
his fair face for the last time. I have folded him in my last em-&#xD;
brace, and for the last time laid my hand in blessings upon his&#xD;
head. He will never return ; or if he does, it will not be until&#xD;
long after I am laid in the grave. No! I cannot hope, I know&#xD;
that I shall never see him more.'&#xD;
And how was he affected-that joyous-spirited boy, who&#xD;
thought that the earth contained no place which he could not&#xD;
inhabit contented and happy ; for he had never yet felt a disap-&#xD;
pointment at which he could not laugh in a few moments after-&#xD;
wards: but when he saw the shores of his native land receding&#xD;
from his view, and felt that each breath of the favorable wind&#xD;
which filled the sails was wafting him still more and more dis-&#xD;
tant, a seriousness to which he had hitherto been a stranger&#xD;
seized upon his heart, and he for the first time felt a possibility&#xD;
of regretting the step which he ha"I taken. But we will not&#xD;
dwell upon the details of the voyage: it is sufficient to say that&#xD;
it was a smooth and safe one. No storms assailed them, and&#xD;
they arrived in Mobile in little less than a month from the time&#xD;
that they sailed from Newport. After remaining in Mobile about&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.             75&#xD;
a week, Mr. Williams determined to go up the Tombigbee river&#xD;
to St. Stephens, a village upon its banks, which then contained&#xD;
inceabt tw hundred inhabitants, and was still flourishing and&#xD;
increasing, and where le was told there was a much better open-&#xD;
ing for merchants than in Mobile. He gave Richard his choice&#xD;
of going with him to St. Stephens, or of remaining in Mobile, as&#xD;
the latter place was theirhport of destination when they left New-&#xD;
cotan ofesidently Rihe thought it only fair to give him a&#xD;
choice of residence. Richard, however, chose to go with him;&#xD;
for his sea-voyage had attached him to both Mr. Williams and&#xD;
his wife, and he had also learned the value of a friend, or even&#xD;
an acquaintance in a strange land, and he appreciated one too&#xD;
highly, voluntarily and without good cause to separate himself&#xD;
from those to whose kind offices he had been solemnlyintrusted&#xD;
by his aunt.                                         se&#xD;

Lies all before him.-jlssAxs.&#xD;
LoNG and dreary did the time seem to Miss Stanley after&#xD;
Richard took his leave, and anxiously did she count the weeks&#xD;
and days until she could hear tidings of her nephew; but at&#xD;
length the long-expected letter came, and it did much to calm&#xD;
her feelings, and to make her think that the separation was&#xD;
rightly ordered by a higher power ; but we will give the greater&#xD;
part of it tohour readers, as it will show the character of the wri-&#xD;
ter better than any version of it which we could give.&#xD;
"ST. STEPHENS, Nov. 18, 18-.&#xD;

since I left you; I never felt how necessary you were to my&#xD;
happiness, until after I had bid you good-bye. And even now&#xD;
I never hear of any thing new or strange (and such things are&#xD;
continually meeting mybears),rI never see a lovely prospect, or&#xD;
think of any thing of which I wish to speak to a friend, but it is&#xD;
to you that my thoughts always turn.&#xD;

was a much better opening here, put his goods of board a&#xD;
barge, and arrived here the night before last ; and I should have&#xD;
written to you last night but I was seeing to the unloading, and&#xD;
otherwise taking care of the goods, until past ten o'clock, and I&#xD;
was then too tired to write. I, however, wrote to you a long let-&#xD;
ler from Mobile, and gave you a description of the voyage. We&#xD;
came from that place up the river in a barge, which jaunt took&#xD;
us three long dreary weeks, a distance that is travelled on horse-&#xD;
back in two days, with the greatest ease.&#xD;
**                          *                 *&#xD;
"St. Stephens is one of the most beautiful natural sites for a&#xD;
town that can be imagined. It is literally a city upon seven&#xD;
hills, and all around it is girdled by the most splendid forest that&#xD;
the eye of man ever rested on. In our New England climate&#xD;
we have no idea of the rich, gorgeous, and ever-various tints&#xD;
that adorn the woodland scenery of a southern autumn, or that&#xD;
beautify the sunset sky. Here the cedar, the pine, the chestnut,&#xD;
the maple, the beech, the gum, the oak, and many other trees,&#xD;
all different in their hues, and mingling a deep red, a sombre&#xD;
brown, a light green, and a light yellow, with here and there&#xD;
one deeper than the rest, are frequently all presented in the&#xD;
same view, and together form a prospect more lovely than I&#xD;
ever supposed could be presented by a mere piece of forest ; but&#xD;
the sunset I will not attempt to describe ; my very pen would&#xD;
tire in the effort, and words are too poor to tell its glories.&#xD;
"The village, or to speak more correctly, the city, for it is in-&#xD;
corporated, is built quite scatteringly ; but upon every hill is a&#xD;
house, and from every house is a prospect that the eyes of a&#xD;
painter might rest upon without satiety forever. But much as&#xD;
I love this scenery, I would, were it possible to annihilate time&#xD;
and space, frequently exchange it, at least for a few hours, for a&#xD;
seat by your fire, with you on one side of me, and Emma and&#xD;
her cat on the other. Give my love and a kiss to my dear sis-&#xD;
ter ; remember me to Mr. and Mrs. Chapman, and Miss Hoxie,&#xD;
and believe, my dear aunt, that you have the most affectionate&#xD;
and grateful love of&#xD;
Your nephew                RICHARD."&#xD;
There was but one source of disappointment in the letter, and&#xD;
that was, he mentioned having written her from Mobile, and that&#xD;
letter had not arrived. But it was not long before she received&#xD;
that also, and by it she learned of all the kindness which had&#xD;
been shown him by Mr. Williams and his wife ; and she shed&#xD;
tears of gratitude that such kind and good friends had been be-&#xD;
&#xD;
77&#xD;
&#xD;
stowed upon her orphan boy; but still her heart yearned towards&#xD;
him with an attraction too great for her to be yet happy without&#xD;
him. And an evening had not passed without her shedding&#xD;
tears as she thought of him while sitting by the fire, and missing&#xD;
his place among them.&#xD;
"I would advise ye, Nancy," said Miss Hoxie, "to go to the&#xD;
veal country after that boy, sooner than for ye to sit here moping&#xD;
yere life away ;" (for hearing the word Mobile, she mistook the&#xD;
sound, and would always call it the veal country.)&#xD;
Alas! Miss Hoxie, it is a long way to go, and I cannot&#xD;
leave this place ; I am wedded to it too firmly."&#xD;
"Ye might go and come back in the time that ye've been&#xD;
crying about him. He is doing well enough."&#xD;
CHAPTER       XXVIII.&#xD;
Phenomenon in all the universe,&#xD;
Of moral being most anomalous,&#xD;
Inexplicable most and wonderful-&#xD;
A human heart.-PoLOC.&#xD;
ON one of the Christmas holidays, a few days after Christmas&#xD;
day, Miss Stanley invited several of her friends to dine with her ;&#xD;
for she was one of those who loved those family and friendly&#xD;
reunions, for which our New England States, after the example&#xD;
of their transatlantic mother, are so famous at certain periods of&#xD;
the year, and consequently she never permitted any of those old&#xD;
festivals to pass unobserved. But this year she had been visiting&#xD;
at the houses of her relatives for several days, and in corres-&#xD;
pondent hospitality she now invited them to hers. She was of&#xD;
course expecting considerable company ; and among the meats&#xD;
for their reception was a huge turkey, which presided as king of&#xD;
the feast. Just before she invited her guests into the dining-&#xD;
room, she went in to look at the table, and found Miss Hoxie in&#xD;
the act of cutting the wing from the turkey. "What are you&#xD;
doing, Miss Hoxie ?" she exclaimed in astonishment.&#xD;
"I am getting the wing for Emma," she replied, without at&#xD;
all discontinuing the operation which she was performing.&#xD;
" Stop ! Miss Hoxie," said Miss Stanley, "'stop ! I entreat you.&#xD;
Surely you do not intend to spoil the turkey for that child !"&#xD;
"She wants the wing-she asked me for it, and I mean to&#xD;
get it for her."&#xD;
"But indeed you must not get it for her; you certainly&#xD;

'78         EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.&#xD;
would not spoil the looks of my table because she has taken a&#xD;
notion for the wing?  If she does want it, she must not have it&#xD;
now-she must wait."&#xD;
" Yes ! and then she won't be able to get it ; for somebody&#xD;
else will ask for it, and ye'll give it to them, and Emma will have&#xD;
to go without."&#xD;
"But, indeed, Miss Hoxie, she cannot have it now !"&#xD;
"Well, then ! I say she shan't have any of it : poor child, ye'd&#xD;
all be willing to starve her."&#xD;
"Starved or not, I cannot have the turkey cut now for her."&#xD;
"Well, ye've said enough about it, so now hold your tongue ;&#xD;
I don't care, I'll see that the poor child gets something to eat,"&#xD;
and so saying she waddled out of the room; and a moment after&#xD;
Miss Stanley heard her going up stairs, talking soothingly to&#xD;
Emma, who was evidently objecting to going with her. After din-&#xD;
ner, as they did not return, Miss Stanley went up to Miss Hoxie's&#xD;
room; but neither her entreaties nor remonstrances could induce&#xD;
Miss Hoxie to come out herself, or to permit Emma to come.&#xD;
"Poor child," she said, "she had had some dinner, and was then&#xD;
asleep, after all their bad treatment, and she was not going to&#xD;
wake her."&#xD;
"Miss Hoxie," said Miss Stanley, "you are ruining that child&#xD;
by your over-kindness, and I really cannot have her so much in-&#xD;
dulged."&#xD;
"Now Nancy, hold your tongue ! for I tell ye I will indulge&#xD;
the poor sick child, and not treat her as ye do."&#xD;
"Do I not treat her kindly ?"&#xD;
"No ! If she was always healthy ye might act to her as ye&#xD;
do now ; ye send her to school as long as she is able to go, and&#xD;
then when she can't go to school, ye give her a task in knitting&#xD;
or sewing every day.&#xD;
"She will thank me for it one of these days, more than she&#xD;
will you for your indulgence."&#xD;
"I don't expect her to thank me ! Who ever did thank me&#xD;
for any thing ! Can ye tell that ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Hoxie, easily ; for I have all my life, for many&#xD;
things, and do yet, every day."&#xD;
" Well ! hold yere tongue, Nancy ! Hold yere tongue, and&#xD;
go down, and let us alone !"&#xD;
Miss Stanley knew by her voice that her anger was subsiding,&#xD;
notwithstanding it was pitched in her loudest key, as was always&#xD;
usual with her when she wished to conclude an argument. She&#xD;
therefore thought it best to leave her as she desired, feeling con-&#xD;
fident that before long she would descend from the stronghold of&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
her chamber: nor was she disappointed, for as soon as Emma&#xD;
awaked from her nap, she was asked in a cheerful voice by her.&#xD;
injudicious nurse, if she was willing to go down stairs, with&#xD;
which request she gladly complied, as it had been much against&#xD;
her inclination that she had gone up ; but though violent herself,&#xD;
if opposed by any one else, she generally yielded to Miss Hoxie,&#xD;
knowing that unless she did so, the wish that she expressed&#xD;
would be instantly changed into a command so vehemently given,&#xD;
that rather than meet it, she complied at once ; for, like most of&#xD;
the violent and irascible, where they find a nature of their own&#xD;
to contend with, the weakest will easily yield. And now she&#xD;
was particularly anxious to go down ; for, besides being desirous&#xD;
to show her best and newest frock to the ladies, she was not at&#xD;
all willing to give up her share of the turkey, and she had reso-&#xD;
lutely rejected all the sweets and dainties that Miss Hoxie had&#xD;
offered her. "And may I have some of the turkey 2" she asked,&#xD;
as Miss Hoxie was combing her hair after her nap.&#xD;
"Hold yere tongue about the turkey, ye little plague ! yes,&#xD;
yes ; ye shall have the whole that's left, and I hope that'll&#xD;
satisfy ye."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
"When sickness pales thy cheek,&#xD;
And dims thy lustrous eye,&#xD;
And pulses low and weak,&#xD;
Tell of a time to die,&#xD;
sweephope shall whisper then:&#xD;
Though thou from earth be riven,&#xD;
-         There's bliss beyond thy ken,&#xD;
There's rest for thee in heaven!"&#xD;
UPoN looking into her finances at the end of the year, Miss&#xD;
Stanley saw that it was necessary for herto find some way by&#xD;
which she might cheek their further waste ; and after consulting&#xD;
with her friends, but particularly with Mr. and Mrs. Chapman,&#xD;
and for some time hesitating between taking a school and taking&#xD;
boarders, she at length determined upon the latter, and requested&#xD;
all of her friends to send to her such persons as they might hear&#xD;
inquiring for board, whom they would be willing to receive as&#xD;
inmates of their own families ; and she accordingly prepared all&#xD;
of her spare rooms for their reception. One day in the May fol-&#xD;
lowing, she was sitting by the fire talking over her future plans&#xD;
and prospects with Miss Hoxie, when a knock was heard at the&#xD;
door.&#xD;

"That's Linton's knock," said Miss Hoxie, "I should know it&#xD;
if I was to hear it clear away in the veal country."&#xD;
"Impossible 1" said Miss Stanley ; but hardly had she pro-&#xD;
nounced the word when he entered the room. But she started&#xD;
as she looked at the spectre which presented itself, he was so&#xD;
much altered since he left her, was so thin, and he walked so&#xD;
feebly towards her; but the unnatural brilliancy of his eyes, and&#xD;
the bright red spot upon his cheek, at once announced consump-&#xD;
tion. She welcomed him gladly and warmly ; but he had no-&#xD;
ticed her surprise at first beholding him, and as he smiled and&#xD;
extended his hand, "I am," said he, "to use the words of Wol-&#xD;
sey, 'come to lay my bones among you,'" and, indeed, his ex-&#xD;
treme feebleness and apparent exhaustion seemed to say that&#xD;
the words were well applied. After resting sufficiently to be&#xD;
able to converse for some length of time without much fatigue,&#xD;
he told her that he would give some account of his sudden ap-&#xD;
pearance there ; "for," continued he, "I know that it is a long&#xD;
time since you have heard from me, as sickness has prevented&#xD;
my writing to you."&#xD;
He told her that he accompanied his regiment which was&#xD;
stationed upon the northern frontier of Maine-that the summer&#xD;
passed away without much injury to his health ; but that every&#xD;
day of the winter had served more fully to unfold the fatal rose&#xD;
of consumption which was blooming upon his cheek ; that much&#xD;
of the time he had been confined to his room, and his bed, and&#xD;
that in every such case the longing desire to be near her, that she&#xD;
might sometimes smooth his pillow, and soothe his soul with&#xD;
such words of comfort as she had often administered, had been&#xD;
so intense, that he could never banish it from his mind, or sub-&#xD;
stitute any other thought in its place ; that, in consequence, he&#xD;
had resigned his commission, and as soon as he was able to&#xD;
travel lie had started for Newport, and had arrived there the&#xD;
night before ; that he had heard that she had one or two&#xD;
boarders, and was willing to take a few more, and that now he&#xD;
had come to ask for a room in her house, for the remainder of&#xD;
the time that he inhabited this lower world. And gladly did&#xD;
she undertake to comfort the few days which now only could be&#xD;
his.&#xD;
But though his frame was thus enfeebled, and though his&#xD;
hours seemed to be numbered upon earth, she rejoiced to see&#xD;
that his mind had in part awaked from the torpor, which seemed,&#xD;
when she first became acquainted with him, to overspread it like&#xD;
a thick cloud. He was now calm, and never overcome by that&#xD;
despair which had so entirely characterized him on his previous&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.               81&#xD;
sojourn at Newport. He inquired about all his Newport friends ;&#xD;
for all who knew him-all with whom he had associated-&#xD;
seemed to feel an interest in him sufficiently lively to merit that&#xD;
appellation; and now he appeared more ready to acknowledge&#xD;
their claims than he had ever been before. He was in truth one,&#xD;
whom to know was to esteem, if not to love. His deep air of&#xD;
dejection at first attracted pity, and his fine mind, his noble&#xD;
heart, and upright principles, which were merely veiled, not&#xD;
hidden by it, and whose light broke through all obstacles, won&#xD;
for him the intense admiration of all with whom he mingled ;&#xD;
and it was deepened by the sorrow elicited by the knowledge&#xD;
that he was hastening to the tomb; for no one could gaze upon&#xD;
his feeble step and attenuated form, or see the hectic upon his&#xD;
cheek, or hear his hollow cough, without being fully aware that&#xD;
consumption had marked him for its own. But the knowledge&#xD;
which to others was a source of sorrow, was to him a well-spring&#xD;
of peaceful joy; to know that he was going to rejoin those loved&#xD;
ones who had gone before, and that he should never more be&#xD;
separated from them, calmed his spirit, and relieved him from&#xD;
that load of despair which, for a time, had so bowed him to the&#xD;
earth.&#xD;

It was because he felt himself dying, that he was now so calm,&#xD;
and at times so cheerful; for religion had lent him her lamp, to&#xD;
guide him onwards-in his journey through the dark regions of&#xD;
the grave.&#xD;

IT was not long before Miss Stanley penetrated the cause of&#xD;
the calm which reigned in the bosom of Captain Linton, and sad&#xD;
were her reflections, and fervent were her prayers, when she first&#xD;
heard him express his feelings upon the subject. He saw her&#xD;
grief, and strove to relieve it. "Why, my dear Christian friend,&#xD;
do you wish 'me to linger longer upon this earth ?" 'said he.&#xD;

suffered much, and I have sinned much, in repining and mur-&#xD;
muring. Now, however, I am resigned to the will of, Heaven,&#xD;
and though I have no wish to live-though I welcome every&#xD;
pain as a herald to eternity, yet should it please Him, whom now&#xD;
with confidence I call 'my Father,' to prolong my life, even&#xD;
should it be prolonged in pain, I think I could submit with pa-&#xD;
tience, and bless his hand for the infliction."&#xD;
And what," said she, "has wrought this happy change in&#xD;
your feelings ?"&#xD;
"Jared Stanley," he replied, "first told me that it was sinful&#xD;
to murmur at those afflictions that Heaven sent. 'Tis true that&#xD;
I had heard the same from the pulpit, and I had read it in books ;&#xD;
but none had ever taught me to feel it-none had even applied&#xD;
it to myself, until one lovely night on our way from Liverpool to-&#xD;
gether. The time and scene are often before me when I dwell upon&#xD;
that conversation. The ship was running steadily onwards, with&#xD;
a fair breeze. All the passengers but myself were asleep, and, ex-&#xD;
cept the watch on deck, and the rippling of the waves against the&#xD;
vessel, every thing was still around us. I had, as usual, spent the&#xD;
evening on a part of the deck, withdrawn from the companionship&#xD;
of other passengers, who, in sooth, no more desired my company&#xD;
than I did theirs ; for I suppose the gloom to which I was a vic-&#xD;
tim oppressed them, and they strove to flee from it. The moon&#xD;
was pursuing her glorious way among the stars ; but there was&#xD;
something in the melancholy softness of her beams, which re-&#xD;
minded me of the most harrowing event of my past life, and I&#xD;
was gazing upon her calm full orb, and with the most torturing&#xD;
feelings recalling every particular that could add agony to a&#xD;
mind obscured by the darkest despair. Jared was that night on&#xD;
the watch, and after I had been sitting, as I have said, for some&#xD;
time, I know not how long, he stopped in the measured pace&#xD;
with which he had been for some time walking the deck, and as&#xD;
he stood not far from me, I felt that he was earnestly observing&#xD;
me; but I felt that I held no communion with my kind, and&#xD;
therefore what cared I for the looks of one of my fellow-men.&#xD;
I had buried all I loved but one, and that one, the most in-&#xD;
tensely dear, was sleeping beneath the waters of Lake Erie. I&#xD;
felt that all I had to do was to endure a life that 'I hated and&#xD;
scorned, and that I had vainly endeavored to cast away in battle ;&#xD;
but which I dared not otherwise destroy. Feeling thus, what&#xD;
was to me the gaze of one who would probably forget me as&#xD;
soon as we separated?&#xD;
"But after standing thus a while, he spoke, and while I have&#xD;
life, neither his words or tone will ever fade from my memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR TILE ORPHANS.                 83&#xD;
The interest that I take in Emma has been principally excited&#xD;
by her voice, it is so much like Jared's ; and when she speaks in&#xD;
earnest sadness, she often reminds me of that night. 'Those who&#xD;
have been afflicted,' said he, 'feel for the unhappy, and I have&#xD;
often watched you thus, alone and apparently comfortless. For-&#xD;
give a stranger for thus interrupting a revery which could not&#xD;
have been pleasant, and if sympathy can alleviate your grief, do&#xD;
not disdain to breathe it into a stranger's ear.' He paused, as if&#xD;
expecting an answer. I had been looking full into his face from&#xD;
the first syllable that he uttered ; for his full, low, sad tones de-&#xD;
manded and fixed my attention; but when he ceased, I turned&#xD;
from him with all the selfishness that is produced by apathetie&#xD;
despair.  'No!' said I, 'No!' Still he stood there, and I was&#xD;
annoyed by his calm eye, which I felt was yet upon me, and&#xD;
thinking that perhaps he did not heap my answer to his kind ad-&#xD;
vances, I spoke to him with that irritation to which an unhappy&#xD;
man is so often a slave, unlee his feelings are softened by all-&#xD;
hallowing grace.   Yes, my dear aunt Nancy! can you believe&#xD;
it? I spoke roughly to him, as I repeated my former answer.&#xD;
For a few moments he resumed his walk, but it was faster and&#xD;
more irregular than before ; it by degrees became as slow and&#xD;
measured as at first ; but he had succeeded in directing my at-&#xD;
tention from any thing but himself, and after a short interval as&#xD;
he passed me, he said, in his own sweet tones, and with marked&#xD;
and peculiar emphasis-&#xD;
'Should sorrow o'er thy brow&#xD;
Its darkened shadow fling-&#xD;
And hopes that.cheer thee now,&#xD;
Die in their early spring:&#xD;
Should pleasure at its birth,&#xD;
Fade like the hues of even;&#xD;
Turn thea away from Earth,&#xD;
There's rest forthee in Ieaven!&#xD;
If even life should seem&#xD;
To thee a toilsome way-&#xD;
And gladness cease to beam&#xD;
Upon its clouded day:&#xD;
If like the wearied dove,&#xD;
O'er the seleoelss ocean driven ;&#xD;
Raise thoa thine eyeabove,&#xD;
There's rest for thee in HeavenP,&#xD;
"Every word of those beautiful lines fell upon my heart, and&#xD;
softened it towards him, and raised it towards heaven, and as he&#xD;
passed me the next time, I rose and extended to him my hand.&#xD;
Forgive the petulance of a lacerated heart,' said I. He grasped&#xD;
my hand with the warmth of a brother, and the electric spark&#xD;
of sympathy and love shot into each bosom at the touch, and&#xD;
has there spread its beautiful and soul-reviving fire. We entered&#xD;
into conversation, and night after night succeeding to that did he&#xD;

&#xD;
arrest my thoughts from the gloomy subjects which generally&#xD;
occupied them, and in those nightly meetings, upon that silent&#xD;
deck, did he pour into my soul the balm of the Christian's hope,&#xD;
such as I had never before felt, and his words have indeed&#xD;
proved like a grain of mustard-seed, which has at length become&#xD;
a tree whose top reaches unto Heaven.&#xD;
"Thus began my change of feeling, and it has been cherished&#xD;
and strengthened by those many assurances of peace and com-&#xD;
fort which have been administered to me by Mrs. Chapman and&#xD;
yourself, and it was the remembrance of the instruction which I&#xD;
gained here, and the hope of its continuance, joined to the&#xD;
knowledge that this was ,Jared's birth-place, and the home to&#xD;
which his thoughts ever fondly turned, and the place where I&#xD;
should be more likely to meet him than any other, which to-&#xD;
gether made me pray that here I might die and that here I might&#xD;
he buried.''&#xD;

THE summer following was quite a happy one to Miss Stanley.&#xD;
She heard often from Richard, and his letters were generally full&#xD;
of hope ; and in them he frequently repeated his day-dream of fu-&#xD;
ture wealth, and his consequent reunion with herself. Jared,&#xD;
after a few trips on board the steamboat, left it at New Orleans,&#xD;
and went to Malaga, thus having fulfilled his hopes of going to&#xD;
some other port than Liverpool. Emma made rapid advances&#xD;
at school, and had quite good health. Miss Stanley had as many&#xD;
boarders as she wished, and though all of them had their peculiar-&#xD;
ities, yet they were easy enough to live peaceably with, and that&#xD;
was as much as she expected. The health of Capt. Linton was&#xD;
so much improved, that she began to entertain hopes of his re-&#xD;
covery, though he endeavored to check them by telling her that,&#xD;
though he might grow much better, and live a year or two, still&#xD;
he felt that in the course of a very few years he should be re-&#xD;
leased ; but she would hope in spite of all he could say against&#xD;
it; for she saw him already so far recovered as to gallant her&#xD;

&#xD;
almost anywhere she wished, and to give her many little atten-&#xD;
tions that Jared would have paid her had he been there ; and as&#xD;
an evidence that it was his desire as much as possible to fill to&#xD;
her her nephew's place, she afterwards had the satisfaction of&#xD;
reading a letter that during that time he addressed to Jared. It&#xD;
was as follows:&#xD;
"NEwPORT,.August 14th, 18-.&#xD;
"My DEAR STANLEY:&#xD;
"I suppose you have heard through our aunt of the many&#xD;
changes which have taken place here since you left ; but yet the&#xD;
pleasure of writing to you is such that I cannot forego it when I&#xD;
am able to carry my pen as fast as my thoughts will flow. You&#xD;
know that my pleasures are not of that cast which the world&#xD;
generally enjoy ; but I think there are few persons who more&#xD;
highly appreciate the delights of true friendship than myself ;&#xD;
and it is for this reason that I so often address you, this being&#xD;
the third letter that I have addressed to you during as many&#xD;
weeks ; for being so long unable to write, I have felt desirous to&#xD;
make up for lost time, and while you live, though the Pacific&#xD;
rolls between us, yet with such means of communication as the&#xD;
blessed art of letter-writing affords, I can never feel alone. My&#xD;
disposition is such that I have seldom known much of the feeling&#xD;
termed lonesomeness, though I have proved that termed desola-&#xD;
tion in its widest range of meaning. I have often longed for&#xD;
sympathy ; but I have seldom felt the want of company. I&#xD;
know that our tastes, our sentiments, our feelings, are in most&#xD;
respects the same, and our influence over each other is attractive.&#xD;
You, however, my dear Jared, are the pole, always steadfast and&#xD;
sure : I am the needle, though constantly varying by the cir-&#xD;
cumstances in which I am placed, yet ever truly pointing to&#xD;
thee.&#xD;
"So much for the preamble. Now for the discourse, which,&#xD;
like its forerunner, will probably be filled with self; but that&#xD;
you tell me will make it only more agreeable to you, and I, with&#xD;
the fond vanity which characterizes me, as far as you are con-&#xD;
cerned, believe you are sincere in saying so, and judging by my&#xD;
own heart (and that the world says is righteous judgment), I&#xD;
know you are so. I suppose you have heard from Rithard be-&#xD;
fore this ; but if you have not, we have. He is safe in Alabama,&#xD;
and has written home many letters full of life,:which I know by&#xD;
the contents come warm from his heart. He continues pleased&#xD;
with the country, pleased with his protectors, pleased with him-&#xD;
self, and pleased with every thing. He was sea-sick going out,&#xD;
but met with the kindest attentions from his compagnons du&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
troyage.  He has written several letters full of detail to aunt&#xD;
Nancy; but though he keeps a stout heart and acts the man,&#xD;
yet he cannot help breathing a desire for home: he is apparently&#xD;
not sorry that he went; but yet there is running through all of&#xD;
his letters a feeling that he is very far from those he loves, and&#xD;
a longing for the power to annihilate both time and space to con-&#xD;
verse with those so nearly and dearly connected to him by all&#xD;
hia memories of happiness, and by the thousand retrospections&#xD;
which arise to him in his far and strange home. Such feelings&#xD;
I have experienced for a time. You speak sometimes as if they&#xD;
were but seldom deserters of your breast, and I often ask myself&#xD;
the question, How can they be, when he leaves such a home&#xD;
as this to become a wanderer, and make his sojourn among&#xD;
strangers?&#xD;
In my last few letters I have told you what, from fear you&#xD;
might not receive any of them, I will briefly repeat, namely-&#xD;
that aunt Nancy wished to take a few boarders on account of&#xD;
pecuniary considerations, and that now she has as many as she&#xD;
wishes ; and that I was compelled, on account of ill health, to&#xD;
resign my commission, but since I have been domiciliated at her&#xD;
house that my health has improved in an astonishing manner.&#xD;
I am now endeavoring, in some slight measure, to fill your&#xD;
place, and I receive from the hands of your beloved aunt those&#xD;
thousand nameless attentions to my wants which she would be-&#xD;
stow upon you, and which it often seems to me that only she&#xD;
could give, which I am certain no other could give as she does ;&#xD;
and once in a while I go with her to sit an afternoon and even-&#xD;
ing with Mr. and Mrs. Chapman, and by that means I enjoy the&#xD;
double pleasure of her conversation, mingled with theirs. Some-&#xD;
times, too, I walk over to Mr. Witherington's to see the fair&#xD;
Lucy. Apropos of Lucy-'tis said that she has lost her heart ;&#xD;
but I think for one to say that of her is a slander upon her, for I&#xD;
hardly believe that she would suffer any one to steal from her&#xD;
what she has hitherto guarded with so much care as to make it&#xD;
doubtful whether she had one : this, however, is a lamentable&#xD;
fact, that something has paled her cheek-that is, when one sees&#xD;
her at home, for when she frequents public places she has re-&#xD;
course to some artificial means to bring her former, color to its&#xD;
place. She has lost much of her embonpoint, and two or three&#xD;
times I have seen her with spirits so depressed, that any one&#xD;
might have perceived how violent was the effort which-she made&#xD;
to rally them; but in a short time she has always been success-&#xD;
ful, and being witness to this self-command, makes me doubt&#xD;
her loving unfortunately. You know that your cousin Harriet&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
is soon to be married to Mr. Thorn ; I think they will, suit ad-&#xD;
mirably, as they are contrasted in the very points requisite to&#xD;
make a happy whole. He has all that decision of character in&#xD;
which she is somewhat deficient. He appears to be the oak&#xD;
which might defy the storm; she the violet that could enjoy the&#xD;
most perfect security in his protection from the blast.&#xD;
"My paper warns me that I must this time stop without say-&#xD;
ing to you half that I intended, either in news about others, or&#xD;
by expressing my own feelings to you; but I intend to make&#xD;
my letters to you weekly chronicles of passing events, as long as&#xD;
I can write without pain ; and we must both be satisfied with&#xD;
this one's now ending, with once more assuring you that I am&#xD;

Letter from Capt. Linton to fared Stanley.&#xD;
"NEWPORT, Oct. 10, 18-.&#xD;
"My DEAR STANLEY&#xD;
"I wrote to you last week, and sent the letter to Mr. Bragg,&#xD;
of New York, requesting him to send it to Malaga by the first&#xD;
merchant-vessel going out; and the very day after I had de-&#xD;
spatched my missive, here comes a letter from you to aunt&#xD;
Nancy, telling us to direct to Havre de Grace,. and that you&#xD;
were bound for that port instead of Malaga, and that you would&#xD;
not probably see the letter during your present voyage. You&#xD;
ask after me as if you had not heard from me in the last three&#xD;
months, though during that time I have written to you many&#xD;
letters ; but it is no wonder that they do not reach you, for by&#xD;
the time they arrive at any place where you tell us to direct,&#xD;
you are off to some other. But I shall not tell you much that&#xD;
I. have already written, because I do not wish to weary you&#xD;
with a twice-told tale ; and I hope, with your usualgood-for-&#xD;
tune in at last getting old letters, that you will yet receive those&#xD;
that I have written.&#xD;
"When I wrote to you during the summer months, I gener-&#xD;
ally spoke of the great and continued improvement in my health ;&#xD;
but of late our autumnal winds have forcibly reminded me that&#xD;
I am still a subject of pain's vast empire.&#xD;

" Emma has discontinued school ; I suspect for the winter.&#xD;
Per child ! she suffers much, though I hardly think that she is&#xD;
conscious of the joy that is debarred her by her being shut out&#xD;
from the play of other children in consequence of her ill health ;&#xD;
or in other words, I think her joys, though of a different kind,&#xD;
are as numerous and as great as other childrens'.  She amuses&#xD;
me often and much by the delight which is afforded her by her&#xD;
kittens and her dolls.  And sometimes, when I feel too feeble to&#xD;
leave my room in the morning, I send for her up to see me; and&#xD;
on such occasions I frequently attempt to teach her such ab-&#xD;
struse sciences as I think she can comprehend, and I can take&#xD;
the trouble to dictate to her young mind. She has learnt her&#xD;
multiplication table ; but she says that she would much prefer to&#xD;
nurse Toney (the name of her cat), or make a bonnet after the&#xD;
latest fashion for her prettiest doll, to studying grammar, for&#xD;
she does not like that at all.  I told her I was going to write to&#xD;
you in a few days, and asked if she had a message for you.&#xD;
' Yes,' she replied ; 'tell him that if he will write to me you&#xD;
will read the letter, and help me to answer it;' and upon those&#xD;
terms I insist upon your complying with her desire. She says&#xD;
that if you will write to her that she will knit you a pair of&#xD;
gloves before you return; for that she can now knit so fast as to&#xD;
beat Mrs. Chapman, with whom she has frequent trials of indus-&#xD;
try, and who always gives her half.&#xD;
"Aunt Nancy is quite well, and she promises to write to you&#xD;
next week.  I hope that I shall myself receive a letter from you&#xD;
in a very short time; and though power to answer it should be&#xD;
denied me, my heart will ever fondly beat at the thought of&#xD;
you ; and until it is stilled by the icy fingers of death, a letter&#xD;
from you would always give inexpressible joy to&#xD;

important treasure. He was aware that she had flattered, and;&#xD;
until she had found the effort of no avail, had persevered in&#xD;
her endeavors to attach him to herself ; but.looking upon her&#xD;
as a coquette, who would use the same endeavors to chain any&#xD;
one to her triumphal car, merely for the glory of the conquest,&#xD;
he had never once imagined that he had in reality made a&#xD;
serious impression upon her heart. He had paid to her only&#xD;
such civilities as he thought due to any lady, without any inten-&#xD;
tion of gaining an interest in her feelings. Perfectly free from&#xD;
the least symptom of love for her, he had rot dreamed of her&#xD;
feeling any for him. He at first met her advances with courtesy;&#xD;
because, as he himself said, she often' amused him and relieved&#xD;
his gloomy thoughts; and afterwards he continued to frequent&#xD;
her father's house, as much from habit as for any other reason.&#xD;
But she had at first determined that he should be her captive,&#xD;
not from any particular partiality for him, but because she felt&#xD;
piqued at his indifference, and resolved to overcome it ; though&#xD;
probably, had she succeeded, tha victory would have contented&#xD;
her, and after she had gained his love, she would have repulsed&#xD;
the heart he would have offered. But the novelty of suing un-&#xD;
successfully made her more eager for conquest, and in endeavor-&#xD;
ing to gain his heart she had lost her own, before aware of the&#xD;
depth of the game she was playing. From the evening of the&#xD;
party when he rejected her invitation, and she awoke to the con-&#xD;
sciousness of the depth of her feelings for him, the color gradually&#xD;
forsook her cheek, and she grew low-spirited and thin, and,&#xD;
though her father was not very tender with his children, he could&#xD;
not help observing the change. 'Tis true she sought company&#xD;
more eagerly than ever, and that of the gayest was her choice;&#xD;
for she had resolved to return the indifference of the only one&#xD;
whom she had ever loved. She did not try to hate; for she&#xD;
was too conscious of his worth to do so. Her health declined&#xD;
under the continual struggle which she kept up between love&#xD;
and pride. She at length gladly seized upon an offer made her&#xD;
by her father of accompanying George to Providence, on a visit&#xD;
to one of her uncles, where he would probably remain two or&#xD;
three months'; and the new scenes and acquaintances to which&#xD;
she was there introduced, relieved her from all sadness, and in&#xD;
the endeavor to conquer other hearts she regained or forgot she&#xD;
had lost her own. In the course of a few weeks she was sur-&#xD;
rounded by admirers, and except when alone, and at times&#xD;
when memory would exert its oft-disputed sway, Linton was&#xD;
forgotten.&#xD;
'Tis true that the meek, the passive, or the weak-minded may&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6673-00000046"/>&#xD;
sink under the effects of unsuccessful love, but there are few who&#xD;
cannot successfully resist its power. As long as they think that&#xD;
possibly they are loved in return, they may find it fruitless to&#xD;
endeavor to become indifferent ; but when all hope is taken from&#xD;
them, slight indeed must be their self-command, if utterly unable&#xD;
to repress the rising sigh-if they cannot school their heart to&#xD;
obey the dictates of pride and reason.&#xD;
This was the first disappointment which Lucy had ever ex-&#xD;
perienced.  She had hitherto moved the queen of hearts, and all&#xD;
within her influence, over whom she had chosen to wield her&#xD;
sceptre, had acknowledged and obeyed her power. Except her&#xD;
father, she exercised undisputed authority over all at home, and&#xD;
over him she had a greater influence than any other had ever ac-&#xD;
quired, for he respected a nature so much like his own. Her&#xD;
pride, in which she gloried, and which she cherished as a virtue,&#xD;
instead of repressing as a source of unhappiness to herself and&#xD;
others, had now received its first check ; but it was doomed ere&#xD;
long to receive others more lasting and more severe, though, like&#xD;
a tree which grows the more shady and luxuriant by being&#xD;
topped, from every check it received it seemed to spread the&#xD;
more.&#xD;
After having been absent about six weeks, she received a&#xD;
letter from her father, recalling her to Newport; and reminding&#xD;
her that Robert would shortly return from college, and that as&#xD;
he wished to show him off, he should be anxious for a party im-&#xD;
mediately after his son's return, and of course her presence would&#xD;
be necessary-and she immediately obeyed the summons.&#xD;
CHAPTER        XXXIII.&#xD;
It is but pride wherewith&#xD;
To his fair son the father's eye doth turn,&#xD;
Watching his growth. Ay, on the boy he looks,&#xD;
The bright, glad creature springing in his path,&#xD;
nut as the heir of his great name; the young&#xD;
And stately tree, whose rising strength ere long&#xD;
Shall bear his trophies well.-HANS.&#xD;
THE time of Robert's collegiate course bad expired, and he&#xD;
returned to his father a graduate, and Mr. Witherington was&#xD;
satisfied ; for he knew not that his son had graduated more on&#xD;
account of his own standing than in regard to the knowledge he&#xD;
had acquired.  And alas ! Robert had while at college become a&#xD;
victim to a vice, of all others the most degrading and the most&#xD;

ruinous--Intemperance had marked him for her own, and it was&#xD;
not long before. Mr. Witherington had such a proof of his frailty&#xD;
as would carry anguish to the heart of any parent ; but to one of&#xD;
a temperament as priud as Mr. Witherington's, none could tell of&#xD;
the anguish of the blow. It was at the party, to give which&#xD;
Lucy had been summoned from Providence, and rather late in&#xD;
the evening, Robert came reeling into the room, too much ine-&#xD;
briated to keep his balance. His father, though at the most dis-&#xD;
tant part of the room, saw him, and with two or three strides&#xD;
was at the side of his son, with his hand on his collar. "What&#xD;
is the matter, father !" said Robert.&#xD;
"Hush !" said Mr. Witherington, in a voice so harsh with an-&#xD;
ger that he could scarcely articulate-" Hush, and come with&#xD;
me !" So saying, he rather roughly pulled him along with him.&#xD;
His intention was to lock him in his room ; but, as he was pass-&#xD;
ing through the side gallery, the carriage whip hanging there&#xD;
caught his eye. In his fury he heeded not its size, nor that it&#xD;
was heavily laden at the end : he took it down, and began to&#xD;
beat him unmercifully with the staff of it. Robert was too much&#xD;
intoxicated to resist, and he had yet remaining a sufficient sense&#xD;
of shame to forbear such loud exclamations as would draw the&#xD;
guests around him ; but a mother's eye had been upon him, and&#xD;
a mother's love was with him. Mrs. Witherington had seen in&#xD;
what state he 'had entered the room; she saw, too, how he had&#xD;
left it, and as her husband did not return she went in quest of&#xD;
them. As she passed the gallery in which they were, she caught&#xD;
Robert's stifled groans and low exclamations of, "Father, you will&#xD;
kill me ! O father, spare me ! I beg of you for the love of&#xD;
heaven, spare me !"  But vain were all entreaties of mercy from&#xD;
him to that infuriated father ; every word that he spoke but&#xD;
added new weight to the blow. Just as Mrs. Witherington&#xD;
reached the spot, he had, by a blow on the side of the head,&#xD;
felled his son to the ground.  She sprang forward.  "Mr.&#xD;
Witherington," she exclaimed, "what have you done?  You&#xD;
have killed him !"&#xD;
"I hope I have !" said he. "The drunken dog ! to come home&#xD;
here and expose himself as he has done to-night. He might&#xD;
better be dead !"&#xD;
"But, oh ! not by your hand ! Robert, Robert," she cried,&#xD;
"speak, move !"&#xD;
Her voice aroused him, for he was only stunned by the blow.&#xD;
He opened his eyes and attempted to rise; but as soon as Mir.&#xD;
Witherington saw that he was not dead, he struck him with the&#xD;
lash of the whip ; but fear of the consequences endued Mrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6673-00000047"/>&#xD;
92          EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.&#xD;
Witherington with an energy which she had never before shown:&#xD;
she rose like a tigress and seized the whip. "Are you mad ?"&#xD;
said she. " Give me the whip !"&#xD;
He suffered her to take it ; for her action had been so sudden,&#xD;
so unexpected and energetic, that in mere surprise he unclasped&#xD;
his hold.&#xD;
" Now go and leave us, unless you want to kill him ! Leave&#xD;
us," said she ; and her manner was so authoritative that, without&#xD;
speaking, he withdrew. One, to have heard her command, and&#xD;
to have witnessed his obedience, would have supposed their&#xD;
natures to have been suddenly changed, and so for the time&#xD;
being they were ; for maternal tenderness and horror at the deed&#xD;
which her husband had so nearly committed, had gifted her with&#xD;
a commanding energy equal to his own; while disappointment,&#xD;
intense, deep, and unlooked-for, had bowed his stern heart to&#xD;
the dust. The idea of Robert's becoming a drunkard had never&#xD;
once crossed his imagination, and that the hateful knowledge&#xD;
should come upon him before so many witnesses, and at the&#xD;
time when they were assembled to do that son honor, had at&#xD;
first enraged him beyond the limits of self-control, and then he&#xD;
felt crushed to the earth. From his cradle Robert had been his&#xD;
favorite son. Gifted in a pre-eminent degree with manly beauty,&#xD;
and of a much higher order of intellect than his elder brother,&#xD;
Mr. Witherington had always in thinking upon him given full&#xD;
scope to the natural pride of his heart. Of a yielding disposition,&#xD;
he had never given to his father those causes of disquietude&#xD;
which George had often done. He had always been rather fond&#xD;
of books, and that was another ground upon which his father&#xD;
had built his proud hopes ; and now to see him fallen thus low--&#xD;
to see all his own hopes blasted, and to find that the only being&#xD;
for whom he had felt such tenderness, was to be an instrument of&#xD;
his degradation, was more than he could tamely bear. It was an&#xD;
arrow in his heart which was long to rankle there, and which was&#xD;
the keenest that had ever afflicted him.         -&#xD;
Mr. Witherington through life had been generally successful.&#xD;
He had in boyhood been poor, and the first object of his youth-&#xD;
ful ambition was riches, and he pursued that object to the total&#xD;
disregard of principle, until he could count the value of his prop-&#xD;
erty by hundreds of thousands. And when he found those&#xD;
wishes so happily accomplished, a desire for other distinction,&#xD;
besides that given him by his wealth, arose in his mind. lie de-&#xD;
termined that his sons should be famous in the annals of their&#xD;
country. He soon found, however, that George took no pleasure&#xD;
in any thing of the kind, and he could not implant in his heart a&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.            93&#xD;
single branch of the mighty tree of ambition which grew so&#xD;
luxuriantly in his own, and his talents were not brilliant enough&#xD;
to warrant his pushing him forward against his inclination. Thus&#xD;
disappointed, his hopes all centered upon Robert. He often&#xD;
pictured to himself the pleasure that he should one day feel in&#xD;
listening to the praises that would yet be heaped upon his favorite&#xD;
son, and in proportion to the length of time that he had thus&#xD;
flattered himself, and the ardor of his hope, was his disappoint-&#xD;
ment and his rage. As I said before, it was the first heavy&#xD;
affliction that he had ever suffered. 'Tis true that he had not&#xD;
escaped the common lot of humanity, for he had followed more&#xD;
than one relative to the tomb ; but his parents had both sunk&#xD;
into the grave at a good old age, and the brother and sisters to&#xD;
whom he had said farewell, were not united to his heart by those&#xD;
ties which bind in one natures of a more tender mould. Neither&#xD;
was he one to sorrow long over the graves of the departed.&#xD;
The voice of gain would at all times drown the tender and melan-&#xD;
choly tones of grief. Degradation he had hitherto escaped ; for&#xD;
though his meains in many instances had been cruel, and his&#xD;
ways crooked, yet as he had never been openly exposed,-he had&#xD;
assumed an equal place with the just and the upright ; but now&#xD;
he felt that disgrace was to be reflected upon him through his&#xD;
son, and he quailed beneath a blow which he could neither for-&#xD;
get or drown by business or pride.&#xD;
Mrs. Witherington was one who hoped all things ; and she&#xD;
fondly believed her son would amend. So thought George and&#xD;
Harriet; but Lucy partook in her father's feelings; and what&#xD;
love she had before borne to her younger brother was, from the&#xD;
moment that she saw him enter the room thattight in such a&#xD;
condition, changed to bitter hate and scorn.&#xD;

"As I have a little leisure and a good opportunity of forward-&#xD;

what I did write in the few moments that were allotted to me,&#xD;
was incoherently expressed ; and in order to retaliate, you have&#xD;
written so fast, and in such a runaway-hand, that it would take&#xD;
a Philadelphia lawyer, or some one much better acquainted with&#xD;
all sorts of scrawls than your brother Jared, to decipher a great&#xD;
number of your words ; and besides that method of punishing&#xD;
my faults, you have tried one yet worse ; you have disobeyed&#xD;
my injunction with regard to writing about yourself. Do you&#xD;
not know, my dear brother, that you are the most interesting&#xD;
subject of which you can write to me?  When I say you, of&#xD;
course I include all those in whom you are particularly inter-&#xD;
ested. However, I by no means consider your remarks as im-&#xD;
pertinent, but attribute them to the good motives by which I&#xD;
know you to be actuated. You must show me the same indul-&#xD;
gence that you crave, and thus we may criticise or condemn&#xD;
each other's proceedings without the least fear of giving offence.&#xD;
"I agree with you that the world in general respects most&#xD;
what most it fears ; but it also respects virtue, and an open,&#xD;
candid deportment, almost against its will. I differ from you&#xD;
with respect to credulity and confidence. That I have been too&#xD;
credulous, and thereby have been often deceived, I readily ac-&#xD;
knowledge ; but I think the opposite extreme would have&#xD;
been doubly disagreeable. A man who is continually fearing an&#xD;
enemy in the disguise of a friend, must live like a ,thief sur-&#xD;
rounded by constables ; and every instance of the depravity of&#xD;
mankind will tend to strengthen his early imbibed prejudice,&#xD;
and make him sensible only of the faults, without his being able&#xD;
to perceive the beauties of the picture of human life, while he&#xD;
permits every noble heart to pass unnoticed amid the general&#xD;
throng, and attributes every generous act to an interested mo-&#xD;
tive. Such sentiments will soon settle any man into a perfect&#xD;
cynic, and make his life one continued scene of precaution, fear,&#xD;
and distrust : while he who cherishes opposite ideas, though he&#xD;
may be often deceived, is equally open to a conviction of his&#xD;
folly ; and the experience he daily gains will serve to correct his&#xD;
too tredulous habits, and teach him to be more careful where he&#xD;
places his confidence. But to state every pro and con on this&#xD;
subject, would exhaust my paper and your patience ; for the&#xD;
view of it widens as I proceed. And having said thus much, I&#xD;
will leave all further comment to yourself, hoping that you will&#xD;
pursue the middle course, and not be led into either extreme,&#xD;
though the knowledge that I have of your character leads me to&#xD;
fear that you will follow my example, and fall into the extreme&#xD;
which I have been advocating.&#xD;

"I received your letter, to which this is an answer, about an&#xD;
hour before I left New York for this port. I was glad to hear&#xD;
that you continued so well pleased with your Alabama situation;&#xD;
and it relieves me from much anxiety to hear that you have such&#xD;
kind protectors. And as for the country, I think, from your de-&#xD;
scription, it must rival Italy in point of climate and fine natural&#xD;
scenery, though its views must be of rather a tamer cast. I&#xD;
should rejoice much to be able to gaze with you upon some of&#xD;
those fine prospects, which you so glowingly describe ; and&#xD;
should I return home next spring, or next fall, I shall try hard&#xD;
to see you once more before I revisit a European port ; that is,&#xD;
provided my voyages till that time should prove prosperous.&#xD;
"I heard from aunt Nancy and from Linton yesterday. As&#xD;
you have opportunities of hearing from them so much more fa-&#xD;

said, for I presume that you are already acquainted with all that&#xD;
could interest you, in their letters.&#xD;
"I cannot yet tell you to what port we are destined from&#xD;
here, as it will depend upon the market; but you must write&#xD;
me often, and direct to me in th same manner as I last wrote&#xD;
to you; for when I leave here, the American consul will forward&#xD;
all that comes addressed to me.&#xD;
" Adieu! my dear brother. Should we never meet on earth&#xD;
again, I hope that we shall be able to welcome each other in a&#xD;
better country, where we may enjoy that fraternal union which&#xD;
is so much denied us now, and which has ever been felt as one&#xD;
of the greatest deprivations in the life of&#xD;

"HAVRE DE GRACE.&#xD;
"DEAR LINTON :-&#xD;
"We arrived here the week before last, in forty-five days from&#xD;
New York, after the most tempestuous voyage that I ever ex-&#xD;
perienced, notwithstanding that I now write myself an old sailor,&#xD;
though yet a young man. It was almost a continual storm from&#xD;
the time that we first lost sight of the American coast, and had&#xD;
not our ship been much better than I thought her, she must&#xD;
have proved our coffin.&#xD;
"I received and answered a letter from aunt Nancy a few&#xD;
days after I arrived here: as the ship by which it was sent had&#xD;
a much quicker voyage than we had, it arrived here almost as&#xD;
soon as I did. I was glad to hear by it that you were with her,&#xD;
though I much regretted the cause which forced you to leave&#xD;
your regiment. Before I received her letter, I had vainly en-&#xD;
deavored to account for your silence to myself, as that was the&#xD;
first intimation I had of your sojourn there, or of your extremely&#xD;
bad health.&#xD;
"You remember my telling you of the fortune which the gip-&#xD;
sy of England foretold me. Well, my dear friend, I suspect&#xD;
that I have indeed met with my destiny in the south. I have&#xD;
lost my heart ! Would that I might say that I had exchanged&#xD;
it; but on that score I fear far more than I hope. I am desir-&#xD;
ous to tell you of all my wishes, as well as of all that befalls me;&#xD;
but I am at a loss how to touch upon a theme which occupies&#xD;
all my thoughts while awake, and blesses me with delightful&#xD;
visions while I sleep. In short, Linton, I love !&#xD;
"Last Sunday I was going to the Cathedral, and at a corner of&#xD;
the street I met a young girl, apparently about seventeen years&#xD;
old, and at the first glance I was enraptured with her wondrous&#xD;
beauty. She was very simply and plainly dressed, but the want&#xD;
of ornament only served to render more remarkable the majesty&#xD;
of her exceeding loveliness. But that was only a momentary&#xD;
glance ! The next day, however, I saw more of her. All my&#xD;
ideas of the Venus de Medici were surpassed by her beautiful&#xD;
face and form. I formerly thought my cousin Lucy beautiful.&#xD;
I shall never think so again, until the memory of Isabelle fades&#xD;
from before my mental vision. Imagine to yourself a complex-&#xD;
ion brilliantly fair, which looks as if the sun of France had never&#xD;
touched it, except to plant rich roses on her cheeks. A profu-&#xD;

its blessed influence, you may yet regain your former health, and&#xD;
live many years, and be a blessing to all who know you. I&#xD;
think that the fine air of Newport, and the nursing of aunt Nan-&#xD;
cy, will be as serviceable to you as any remedy you could pro-&#xD;
ose. I hope that I shall yet have the happiness of seeing you&#xD;
an inmate of her house. I should like to know what room in it&#xD;
you occupy !&#xD;
"Your account of Emma pleased me much. I will write to&#xD;
her by the same ship which will take this ; but yet I charge you&#xD;
with a brother's kiss to her. I feel grateful, too, that aunt&#xD;
Nancy has been so successful in her designs, and that her health&#xD;
continues good as usual. When I am absent from her, I always&#xD;
hail one of her letters with peculiar joy, which assures me that&#xD;
she is well; and whenever a longer time than usual elapses with-&#xD;
out my hearing from her, I cannot describe to you the anxiety&#xD;
which I suffer on her account.&#xD;
"I wrote to you about a month since, and gave you some ac-&#xD;
count of the lovely Isabelle Sian. The very next day after I&#xD;
dispatched my letter, as she was going home, a Frenchman fol-&#xD;
lowed her, and insisted upon gallanting her. She rejected all&#xD;
his offers, and upon his seizing her arm, she broke her violin&#xD;
across his face, in order to get rid of him; but this enraged him&#xD;
so much that he determined to force her to accompany him, if&#xD;
she would not permit him to go with her, and he attempted to&#xD;
drag her onward. Upon his proving the stronger, she screamed,&#xD;
and as I happened to be in the next street, and heard her, I ran&#xD;
to her assistance ; though I little suspected to whose aid I was&#xD;
hastening. I knocked the man down, and while I was engaged&#xD;
with him, she ran off home. The next day I met her, and the&#xD;
occurrence of the former led to an acquaintance, or, as you would&#xD;
call it in America, to an intimacy. I at first tried hard to gain&#xD;
her consent to visit her at home ; but she has never consented,&#xD;
and has told me that she never would. At first she told me&#xD;
that her father had gone to Dunkirk upon business, and that her&#xD;
mother would not allow it, and upon my urging her somewhat,&#xD;
she said that she could not consent to be seen walking the streets&#xD;
with any man ; for that her profession was of that kind, which&#xD;
in any case, and with all her prudence, would give employment&#xD;
to wicked tongues, and that, consequently, she has to abstain&#xD;
from all social intercourse at her own fireside, with all of our sex.&#xD;
We have met, however, almost daily, at the house of a friend of&#xD;
hers, who keeps a coffeehouse here, but who, like herself, has&#xD;
seen better days. Our interviews, however, are very short ; but&#xD;
think you that I could keep up this intercourse and not whisper&#xD;

love?  Oh, no! I. dared to breathe that magic name, and she&#xD;
replied with a frankness which made me love her more, even&#xD;
while it blasted all my hopes. She told me that she had a lover&#xD;
at Dunkirk, to whom she had given all her heart before she&#xD;
knew me, and that, though she should always feel grateful to&#xD;
me, I must not mistake that for love, except it were such love as&#xD;
she might have for a brother. And now, though it makes me&#xD;
tremble to write of her, yet believe me when I assure you that&#xD;
I would rather be the means of uniting her to the man of her&#xD;
heart than to possess her myself. A few days ago, however&#xD;
my forbearance was sorely tried. I was in the coffeehouse that&#xD;
I have mentioned, when a letter was handed to her: she read it,&#xD;
and fell fainting into my arms. It contained the news of her&#xD;
father's death. To have seen her thus fainting with grief-lean-&#xD;
ing- her head on my bosom, and, after she had a little revived&#xD;
weeping at the sad news, and me wiping off the tears which&#xD;
flowed down her lovely cheeks, though I was tough enough to&#xD;
prevent mine from mingling with them-you would have thought&#xD;
me enchanted; and so I should have been, had I not known she&#xD;
was another's; but I could not help saying to myself as she lay&#xD;
almost lifeless in my arms-My God ! why can I not ass m&#xD;
whole life with this lovely being? Thus you see is one more&#xD;
part of my destiny fulfilled ; for from henceforth the name of&#xD;
love to her, can never pass my lips, for I hope yet to hear of&#xD;
her union to him to whom she has given her heart; but after&#xD;
once knowing her, no other of her sex can ever take the lace in&#xD;
my heart which she has once filled. But you see how she et&#xD;
occupies my thoughts; for when I begin to write of her, I can&#xD;
find room for no other subject. Again my paper is full-and&#xD;
full of Isabelle ! but this is probably the last time that I shall&#xD;
ever mention her name to you. It is now a fond dream from&#xD;
which I have awakened, and I have only to bow in humble sub-&#xD;
mission to Him, who has perhaps decreed that my lot upon earth&#xD;
is to be that of a wanderer, never to be cheered by the fond&#xD;
smiles of woman. My duty is now forgetfulness, and by His aid&#xD;
(whom I have wronged b worshipping a morta   duyHshall&#xD;
be fulfilled.by                    mortal) my duty shall&#xD;
"Adieu, my friend : that God may guard you and restore you&#xD;
to health, is the prayer of one who, in affliction or joy, always&#xD;
feels himself your attached friend,&#xD;

For while his Father rules the world,&#xD;
lIe knows that world is his-C. FaY.&#xD;
Letter front Copt. Linton to Jared Stanley.&#xD;
"NEwPORT.&#xD;
" MY nEAR FiUENI):-&#xD;
"You know not hogw much I rejoice that I am here. I have&#xD;
the rcom you occupied wvhen last with your aunt. I sit by the&#xD;
window and think of you. I place my books on the shelf which&#xD;
you put up, and am even now writing out of the inkstand which&#xD;
you have often used. You wish for the restoration of my health.&#xD;
I would not deceive you : my improvement was but short-lived,&#xD;
and I know that I am hastening to that bourne from which-no&#xD;
traveller returns. But l-t it not grieve you that I am going to&#xD;
an early grave ; rather rejoice that I have a Father above, to&#xD;
whom yourself and excellent friends have pointed me-that I&#xD;
have found his love above all that I expected, even when I had&#xD;
seen it exhibited in the lives of so many ; rather feel thankful&#xD;
that unless my life is lengthened out beyond the hopes of all&#xD;
who know me, that my last days will be spent in the society of&#xD;
those amiable beings among whom it is now cast ; that my pas-&#xD;
sage to the tomb will be'smoothed by the consolations of re-&#xD;
ligion, and that my dying pillow will probably be placed by the&#xD;
hands of our beloved aunt. I feel that I gradually decline, that&#xD;
the tenure of my life is growing more and more frail; but, ex-&#xD;
cept in the harassing and distressing cough which always&#xD;
accompanies consumption, I have but little pain.&#xD;
I   have three attendants : aunt Nancy is my physician&#xD;
and my nurse ; Mrs. Chapman is my comforter and my pastor ;&#xD;
and Emma is my amusement. I believe the first question which&#xD;
she asks every morning is the state of my health ; and if I am&#xD;
not able to go down stairs, which is now often the case, as soon&#xD;
as breakfast is over she comes to see me, and she has always&#xD;
some tale to tell which she has read the dny before, or some&#xD;
other way to lead me to forget myself; and she will find out more&#xD;
means to make me smile-which is the only recompense she&#xD;
wishes-than I should suppose possible in a child of her age.&#xD;
She will not let me take a very active part in our conversation,&#xD;
because she says it will injure me ; and she generally condemns&#xD;
me to do just what she permits 'Tony' to do-that is, to sit close&#xD;
&#xD;
ii&#xD;
&#xD;
°&#xD;
&#xD;
by her, and attend to what she says. She will, however, let me&#xD;
say as much as I please about you without interrupting me.. I&#xD;
talked to her some time the other day about you, and then I&#xD;
asked her why she did not stop me. 'Because,' said she, 'when&#xD;
you talk of Jared, I love him so well that I forget how the time&#xD;
passes, and I do not wish to stop you; but if you think you&#xD;
have hurt yourself this time talking about him, you must not&#xD;
speak of him at all any more.' Thus you see she has already&#xD;
the self-denying attribute of her whole sex, willing to cut them-&#xD;
selves off from their dearest pleasures, rather than in a slight&#xD;
degree to injure one whom they love.&#xD;
"Our aunt has an old lady to board with her this winter whom&#xD;
I think a curiosity in her way. She is the widow of an old Rev-&#xD;
olutionary soldier, who was killed towards the end of that mem-&#xD;
orable struggle : she petitions Congress every winter for a&#xD;
pension, and says she always will until they grant her one.&#xD;
There is no doubt but her claim is a good one ; but I cannot&#xD;
help smiling when I think of the effect that one of her letters&#xD;
must have upon that body of statesmen; for she always makes&#xD;
her petition in the form of a letter, which she writes herself, and&#xD;
always directs to the vice-president ; because, she says, that as&#xD;
he presides in the Senate, he is of course the most proper person&#xD;
to receive all communications made to that body. She gave me&#xD;
one of her effusions to read and punctuate a few days ago, and&#xD;
I tried my best to dissuade her from sending it, and offered, if&#xD;
she would not, to write a petition for her. She wanted to see&#xD;
my petition before she concluded, and I accordingly penned one&#xD;
to the best of my ability ; but she liked her own best, and ac-&#xD;
cordingly sent it. I will give you some idea of the whole tenor&#xD;
of the epistle by one extract which I happen to remember.&#xD;
Oh, tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askalon,&#xD;
that a widow of one of them who gained for you the freedom&#xD;
that you now enjoy, should write to you seven letters, and that&#xD;
they should all be in vaia! You boast of your gratitude ! I&#xD;
ought to be one of its objects. You boast of your good govern-&#xD;
ment! I suppose this is the evidence,'&amp;amp;c. Now what do you&#xD;
suppose the vice-president would think should he ever so lightly&#xD;
read such an effusion? Mrs. Colleris has another peculiarity&#xD;
about her : she thinks that every year is to be her last; and she&#xD;
has had her. shroud made for ten years, and carries it with her&#xD;
wherever she goes, though she looks as if she would be likely to&#xD;
live more than ten years to come. But is it not strange that,&#xD;
with this constant fear of death, she is generally cheerful, and&#xD;
always talkative?  Perhaps you will reply, 'Not more so than&#xD;

102&#xD;
&#xD;
that Linton, now that he feels himself walking rapidly downwards&#xD;
to that same narrow house, should grow more cheerful, and&#xD;
more resigned to the Omnipotent will every day that he lives.'&#xD;
But such an inference would be wrong, for I do not fear death,&#xD;
and she does-it seems to be the darkest spot in the horizon of&#xD;
her existence ; but I hail as a friend what to her is a monster.&#xD;
To me death is only a messenger sent by my Father to conduct&#xD;
me to brighter realms, where I shall meet with those whom I&#xD;
have loved to that excess which is sin ; but I hope that that sin&#xD;
is forgiven; for if there is yet some regret for the fate of a loved&#xD;
one clinging round my heart, I can in humble confidence say as&#xD;
I look upwards,&#xD;
Because it is T1hy will, '&#xD;
"Adieu, brother of my soul' Esdras has said that a friend&#xD;
is the medicine of life ; and truly 'ch have you been to me ; for&#xD;
you first taught me to look above for a balm for all my grief ;&#xD;
and you were the means, even against my will, of my meeting&#xD;
with those two friends who have cheered, consoled, and elevated&#xD;
me, until I feel, 'that whether I live or die, I am the Lord's.'&#xD;
"It is at intervals only that I have been able to write this long&#xD;
and crowded letter, and my strength has so failed that almost&#xD;
every paragraph has been the work of a separate day. It is the&#xD;
last that I shall ever write to you. I pray you to think that my&#xD;
last thought will be of you, and my last prayer will be for your&#xD;
safety, and with such sincerity will it be breathed, that&#xD;
'If ever mortal's prayer,&#xD;
For others weal availed on high,&#xD;
Mine will not all be lost in air,&#xD;
But waft thy name beyond the sky.'&#xD;
"Adieu, my friend ! That you may be ever blessed as you&#xD;
deserve to be, is the fervent prayer&#xD;
"Of your affectionate     LINTON."&#xD;
Jared did not return home as he expected to do when he had&#xD;
last written ; but after arriving in Charleston he yielded to the&#xD;
wish of his captain and made with him the next voyage also, as&#xD;
the following letter written during that voyage to his brother&#xD;
Richard will show.&#xD;
Letter from Jared Stanley to Richard.Stanley.&#xD;
"MALAGA, July.&#xD;
"Mr DEAR BROTHER&#xD;
"We arrived here in the ship Argos, nineteen days from&#xD;
Havre, where we stayed only three days, because we feared be-&#xD;
ing stopped by the French Government. We shall probably&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
103&#xD;
&#xD;
stay here a month longer. Our orders are for New York ; and&#xD;
if we do not get a freight, we shall load on the owner's account,&#xD;
in time to get away by the 10th or 15th of next month. As&#xD;
there is a vessel to sail for America in a few days, I hereby tell&#xD;
you that I am alive and well, though I cannot say much more as&#xD;
yet. We were four days in quarantine, and since that time I&#xD;
have been on shore but twice, as we do not lie by a wharf, but&#xD;
moored head and stern in the harbor, and I stayed but a short&#xD;
time on shore when I was there; but once I went to the Cathe-&#xD;
dral, which is the most magnificent church I ever saw. I wish&#xD;
you could be here a little while to see the churches, old forts,&#xD;
&amp;amp;c., and to eat some of the delicious grapes and figs, and sev-&#xD;
eral other kinds of fruit. The weather here is excessively warm.&#xD;
The city stands on a low piece of ground surrounded by hills,&#xD;
which prevent its having much wind, and as it has a southern&#xD;
exposure, it feels all the force of a powerful sun.&#xD;
"When I was last in Havre I intended going home on my re-&#xD;
turn to the United States ; but Captain Wiseman was so anxious&#xD;
for me to make this voyage with him, that I concluded to do so,&#xD;
and return home in the fall, I wrote to you twice from Havre,&#xD;
and told you that if you directed there the letter would be for-&#xD;
warded to me ; but I have received only one letter from you in&#xD;
thirteen months, and I don't know much more about you and&#xD;
your affairs, than does the King of France. I hope you will&#xD;
answer this as soon as possible, and direct your answer to&#xD;
Charleston, U. S., or to New York ; and also write me another&#xD;
letter directed to Newport, and calculate for it to get there&#xD;
by the last of September, so that I may hear from you as soon&#xD;
as I get home. Tell me all about your situation and prospects,&#xD;
and remember that any thing that you can write respecting&#xD;
yourself, which has happened during the last year, will be news&#xD;
to me. I have almost determined just to go this voyage to pass&#xD;
away the summer, and then, unless my prospects to continue on&#xD;
the water should be extremely good, to leave an. employment&#xD;
that I never have liked, and that I feel convinced I never can,&#xD;
and move off to Alabama. When you write to me, tell me what&#xD;
you think of my plans.&#xD;
"We had a very rough passage out, and I never had such&#xD;
serious thoughts of going to the bottom in my life. Our rudder&#xD;
was out of order, and we could not steer the ship in rough&#xD;
weather, consequently we were obliged to lay to in all the severe&#xD;
gales which we encountered, and I assure you they were neither&#xD;
few nor short. Added to this, the ship leaked. We were short&#xD;
handed, and the crew we had were poor sailors.&#xD;

"The partner of the American consul here is a Mr. Wright, of&#xD;
Newport.   hearing I was from  that place, he came on board&#xD;
yesterday to see me, and we had a long conversation respecting&#xD;
our friends across the water. He gave me a polite invitation to&#xD;
come and see him whenever I could, and made me promise to&#xD;
call upon him every time I went on shore, saying that it was sel-&#xD;
dom that he saw a native of Newport, and that when he dkl he&#xD;
wished to have their society as much as possible.&#xD;
"When I first went to Hlavre, in my voyage before this, I re-&#xD;
ceived a letter from aunt Nancy, in which she complained some-&#xD;
what of bad health, and I have been very anxious about {her&#xD;
ever since; for you know she was never very robust, and 'I&#xD;
thought when I left home last she was more delicate than she&#xD;
used to be ; but as you had never been separated from her I&#xD;
suppose that you hardly noticed it.  I have not heard from her&#xD;
for more than five months; but I do not think it is her fault,&#xD;
for I am like the Wandering Jew, so short a time in any one&#xD;
place, that it is difficult for a letter to find me ; and I make the&#xD;
same excuse for you too, and accordingly write to both of you as&#xD;
frequently as if all my letters were punctually answered.&#xD;
"But adieu, my dear brother : it is very late, and a berth is&#xD;
now a more appropriate place than the writing-table, for your&#xD;
affectionate brother,                            JARED."&#xD;
CHAPTER        XXXVII.&#xD;
"The mourner sad, who drowned in grief&#xD;
Hath long in sorrow striven,&#xD;
Shall find at last a sweet relief,&#xD;
Tears wiped away in heaven!&#xD;
"What though affliction he our lot,&#xD;
Our heart with anlguish riven;&#xD;
Still, never let it be forgot,&#xD;
There are no tears in heaven !"&#xD;
THE time had now arrived when the life of the amiable and&#xD;
sorrow-stricken Linton was rapidly drawing to its close. Miss&#xD;
Stanley sat by his bedside holding his hand in hers, and he was&#xD;
gazing upon her with such a look of tenderness as a son might&#xD;
bestow upon a much-loved and respected mother. Thus had&#xD;
passed some time without either of them speaking. Miss.Stanley&#xD;
was too much oppressed with grief at losing him to speak, and&#xD;
his thoughts were coming too fast for him to give them utterance.&#xD;
His countenance showed what was passing in his mind ; but one&#xD;
who had formerly known him would have been surprised, while&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.            105&#xD;
watching its changeful expression, to perceive that all traces of&#xD;
sorrow had disappeared from his face, and that it was almost&#xD;
radiant with peace and joy. The sun was just rising, and as he&#xD;
caught its first beams, "It is the last time that I shall watch it&#xD;
from here," said he, pointing as he spoke to the'glorious orb.&#xD;
Miss Stanley no sooner heard his voice, and perceived by its&#xD;
weak tones how rapidly his life was ebbing away, than she bowed&#xD;
her face upon his hand that she held and wept bitterly  "Oh, do&#xD;
not weep !" said he half reproachfully,."do not dampen the joy&#xD;
that I feel in dying, by forcing me by those tears to regret that&#xD;
I am about to leave you !"&#xD;
She raised her head : "I know that I am wrong ; but I cannot&#xD;
bear even the thought of losing you. How dreadful, then, will&#xD;
be the reality !"&#xD;
"And would you, then, keep me from that heaven to which&#xD;
you have pointed the way ?" said he, while a peaceful smile&#xD;
played upon his lips. "Oh! no, my dear aunt, rather rejoice&#xD;
that I am about to rejoin that mother, who, even in yon holy&#xD;
abode, will feel her bliss heightened when she there welcomes&#xD;
you, by the gratitude she will owe you for your kindness to her&#xD;
son ; and there, too, I shall meet with Eveline-my first and&#xD;
only love-my early-lost and too-much deplored ! You love me&#xD;
too well, I know, to wish to-detain me here ; for far beyond the&#xD;
joy that will give me, shall I not be welcomed by the glad&#xD;
saying, 'Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,' pronounced by&#xD;
Him who died to redeem me, and who has graciously assured&#xD;
me of his love and forgiveness, by those inward rejoicings and&#xD;
that peaceful resignation to his will which of late have filled&#xD;
my soul?"&#xD;
His speaking greatly exhausted him, and he fell into a quiet&#xD;
slumber. When he awoke, he appeared refreshed and strength-&#xD;
ened. He asked for Emma, and she was called into the room.&#xD;
He laid his hand upon her head, and moved his lips a moment,&#xD;
as if in prayer. "May God's blessing rest upon you through&#xD;
life, my dear child !". said he ; "may you continue to grow more&#xD;
and more like your brother Jared, whom you now so much re-&#xD;
semble." His talking thus to her seemed to affect him, as Miss&#xD;
Stanley thought, too much, and she led Emma weeping from the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
"Mrs. Chapman, my dear madam," he exclaimed, observing&#xD;
her entrance, "rejoice with me ; I am going home ! I am hasten-&#xD;
ing to my mansion above-' to a house not built with hands,&#xD;
eternal in the heavens.'  It is, my friends," he continued, ob-&#xD;
serving a tear trembling in her eye, "but a short separation--&#xD;

&#xD;
merely a good-night ; for, though we shall sleep in separate&#xD;
apartments, we shall soon rejoin each other, and breakfast with&#xD;
the Lamb."&#xD;
Mrs. Chapman suggested that his speaking might the sooner&#xD;
exhaust his strength.&#xD;
"Oh, no !" he replied; 1' God has given it to me for these&#xD;
last moments, that I may bear a joyful testimony of his love ;&#xD;
for, though I feel the chill of death's approaching footsteps, yet&#xD;
I have more strength to speak than I have had for many days,&#xD;
and much more than I had only a few hours ago: I have yet&#xD;
some parting words to say. Tell Richard, my dear aunt," con-&#xD;
tinued he, "that I remembered him on my bed of death. I was&#xD;
first interested in him for his sunny disposition, but latterly I&#xD;
have loved him for his love of you. Tell him to fulfil the prom-&#xD;
ise of his youth, and his best friends can ask no more."&#xD;
He paused, as if endeavoring to rally his strength. "Aunt&#xD;
Nancy," said he, endeavoring to rise, "take this ribbon from my&#xD;
neck ; it is fastened to my mother's miniature : give it to Jared.&#xD;
He will prize it for my sake ; and give him that package that I&#xD;
gave you for him ; and tell him that I bless him with my dying&#xD;
breath. I need not ask him to remember me, for that I know&#xD;
he will do ; but with the news of my death-alas ! I grieve to&#xD;
think how sad such tidings will make him-give him the con-&#xD;
soling assurance that he was the first who awaked me from&#xD;
despair, and showed me a brighter hope beyond the grave." He&#xD;
stopped, overcome by his feelings. "'Tis well he is not here,"&#xD;
he resumed, "for if he were by my side, I fear that the agony&#xD;
of parting with him would overbalance the joy that I feel at the&#xD;
prospect of joining those loved ones who have gone before me.&#xD;
But oh, no ! I wrong him by the thought ; for he would fortify&#xD;
me for the last farewell which we should ever take, and he would&#xD;
assist me to pass through that dark portal which opens upon&#xD;
that glorious region beyond."&#xD;
In spite of every effort to restrain them, Miss Stanley's tears&#xD;
flowed fast and thick.&#xD;
"Do not weep, my dear aunt," said he ; "the hand that&#xD;
wounds can heal. Trust in Him, and he will support you."&#xD;
There was silence for some moments in that calm room of&#xD;
death,-unbroken, save by the heavy breathing of tje dying man,&#xD;
or the suppressed sighs of those two affectionate friends who so&#xD;
keenly felt the anguish of losing him who seemed already to be&#xD;
tasting the glories of heaven. At length he moved his head, as&#xD;
If its position had become uneasy. Miss Stanley rose and at-&#xD;
tempted to adjust his pillow. "Mother, kiss your son," said he,&#xD;

as she bent over him. She bowed her bead, and imprinted a&#xD;
kiss upon those cold lips, which were powerless to return the&#xD;
pressure. "To God I commend you," said he faintly and with&#xD;
difficulty-closed his eyes, and lay for a moment perfectly quiet,&#xD;
drew one broken sigh, and was at rest forever !&#xD;
CHAPTER       XXXVIII.&#xD;
Though griefs unnumbered throng thee round,&#xD;
Still in thy God confide ;&#xD;
Whose finger marks the seas their bound,&#xD;
And curbs the headlong tide.-MaRIcsr.&#xD;
Is it not strange, short-sighted as we are, is it not strange,&#xD;
with daily, hourly proofs of man's mortality before our eyes,&#xD;
we still set death at a distance from ourselves, and those most&#xD;
fondly loved, most highly prized? When commissioned from&#xD;
above, his fell shaft flies unseen in its approach-in a moment&#xD;
severs firmest ties-breaks the chain of earthly affections: the&#xD;
heart is now made to writhe under a separation which spreads&#xD;
a thick cloud of darkness over future temporal prospects, and&#xD;
fills the mourner's heart with indescribable anguish. Such were&#xD;
now the feelings of Miss Stanley. She had continued to hope,&#xD;
until the last day of Capt. Linton's life, that he would recover ;&#xD;
nor could all that he said take from her that hope. She had so&#xD;
often seen Emma's life at so low an ebb, and still regain her&#xD;
usual health, that she could not be persuaded that he would die.&#xD;
He had become to her affections the relative that he claimed to&#xD;
be. He had been an inmate of her house for more than a year,&#xD;
and during all that time both of her nephews had been absent.&#xD;
He came, too, shortly after her house had been made desolate by&#xD;
Richard's departure ; and though she did not transfer any of&#xD;
her love from Richard, yet, by Linton's endeavors to fill his&#xD;
place-by his encouraging her to expect of him, when his health&#xD;
permitted, the little attentions which her nephew would have be-&#xD;
stowed-and when he was in more feeble health, the habit&#xD;
which she had acquired of asking his advice in the thousand&#xD;
points upon which men are better qualified to judge than wo-&#xD;
men-his patience, too, and resignation-his endeavors to take&#xD;
from her all hope of his recovery, and to make her cherish one&#xD;
better for him in its stead,-all these things had endeared him&#xD;
to her by such ties as bind us to our kindred, and therefore she&#xD;
mourned for him with bitter grief. But she had learned too&#xD;

well to suffer, and to bow in-meek humility to the will of God,&#xD;
long to repine.  She knew, indeed, that he was happy  and&#xD;
when the first ebullition of her sorrow had subsided from its own&#xD;
intensity, and she could turn a sober attention to the many mer-&#xD;
ciful circumstances appended, that faith, which is the evidence&#xD;
of things unseen, came on angel wings to raise her sinking soul&#xD;
to heaven, and by it she heard the Saviour's voice, "I am the&#xD;
resurrection and the life ;" by it she saw the benignant smile ;&#xD;
accompanying the affectionate invitation and assurance, "Come&#xD;
unto me, all ye who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give&#xD;
you rest." She felt the unfailing support of that powerful Arm&#xD;
which imparts strength to the weak, and is a present help in&#xD;
time of trouble. Her inmost thoughts were sensibly impressed&#xD;
with a view of the infinite condescension of that gracious Being&#xD;
who proclaims himself abundant in goodness and truth : she felt&#xD;
how sweetly consoling was the invitation and command of the&#xD;
great Giver of every good gift, to look to him for a supply for&#xD;
all our needs, annexing the encouraging intimation, amounting to&#xD;
an assurance, that none shall seek his face in vain : she felt that&#xD;
nothing could separate her from his love, and that his eye was&#xD;
ever upon her : she felt that his love was a covert hiding-place&#xD;
from every storm and tempest, and that he would fit her to en-&#xD;
dure every sorrow that he saw fit to inflict. And truly, at this&#xD;
time she had need for all her fortitude ; for, from some reason&#xD;
unaccountable to her, both of her nephews had been silent a&#xD;
much longer time than usual. It was more than six months&#xD;
since she had heard any thing from Jared : when he wrote his&#xD;
last letter, which was dated from Antwerp, he was undecided&#xD;
whether he should return home from thence or not, and he was&#xD;
also in doubt, if he did return to America, whether he should&#xD;
come to see her, or first make another voyage.  He had then,&#xD;
however, promised to write to her soon, and inform her upon both&#xD;
these points ; and now, from his lengthened silence, she could&#xD;
not avoid fearing that the great deep had received him into its&#xD;
bosom. From Richard she had not heard for about two months;&#xD;
and her horror of all new countries, aided by some accounts&#xD;
which he had given her, made her attribute his protracted si-&#xD;
lence either to some dreadful accident or to death. At one time&#xD;
she fancied him writhing beneath the knife of an assassin ; at an-&#xD;
other, lying, unattended and alone, withering beneath the blast-&#xD;
ing touch of an Alabama fever. Added to these causes of anx-&#xD;
iety, Emma was violently attacked, and for several days she&#xD;
hung over her bed in the agonizing fear that her hours were&#xD;
numbered, and that the time had come when she must bid her&#xD;
&#xD;
adieu until they should meet above. 'Tis true, in this season of&#xD;
affliction, Miss Stanley was not alone, for she had made friends&#xD;
of every inmate of her house, and in each of her boarders she&#xD;
found one anxious to console her, and the excellent Mrs. Chap-&#xD;
man devoted to her every moment which was not claimed by&#xD;
paramount duties. No human aid, however, could much avail&#xD;
in such a season of accumulated woe.  Happily, she leaned&#xD;
trustingly upon His arm, upon whom she had never yet trusted&#xD;
in vain, and who she knew would not afflict her beyond the&#xD;
strength to bear, with which he would endow her.&#xD;

Letter from Miss Stanley to Richard.&#xD;
"NEwPORT, October 1, 18-.-&#xD;
" MY DEAR RICHARD:-&#xD;
"The day before yesterday the remains of the much esteemed&#xD;
Linton were committed to the narrow mansion of the tomb. I&#xD;
cannot describe to you how desolate the room that he occupied&#xD;
appears. I have neither time nor means to permit me to indulge&#xD;
in vain regrets; and I know if I had, that it would be wrong for&#xD;
me to improve them for such a purpose. 'The Lord giveth, and&#xD;
the Lord taketh away, and blessed be the name of the Lord;'&#xD;
but though I can thus write, yet I fear that I regret his death&#xD;
more than is quite right for me to do; for he had made his peace&#xD;
with God, and went to meet him with the same joy that an ex-&#xD;
iled son might feel to regain his parent and his country-&#xD;
'By manya death-bed I have been,&#xD;
And many a parting I have seen,&#xD;
But never aught like his I'&#xD;
"He was not glad to be taken from pain ; for he endured but&#xD;
little-but he rejoiced to go'home. But though so anxious to&#xD;
depart, he was willing to stay, should it be his Father's will to&#xD;
purify him still more by the ordeal of suffering, ere he took him&#xD;
to himself. His joyous release-for I can give it no more ap-&#xD;
propriate name-though we know it his gain, makes his loss&#xD;
more deeply felt.&#xD;
"He sent you his blessing from his death-bed, and bade me&#xD;

tell you to go on and fulfil the p1 mise of your youth, and your&#xD;
dearest friends could ask no more ; and I feel that he spoke the&#xD;
truth, my dear boy. You have remembered your Creator in the&#xD;
days of your youth, and if you continue to trust in him he will&#xD;
never leave you nor forsake you.&#xD;
"I have been much troubled of late by not hearing from you.&#xD;
This is the third time that I have written to you since I have re-&#xD;
ceived a line from you. Two long months have passed since I&#xD;
have heard from you. I cannot account for your silence. I am&#xD;
sure that you do not willingly neglect me, and I fear that sick-&#xD;
ness has palsied your hand ; for what else would defer your long-&#xD;
expected letter?  It is more than six months since I have heard&#xD;
from our too often absent one-our beloved Jared ; and the&#xD;
silence of both of you, together with Linton's death and Emma's&#xD;
sickness, have sorely tried me, and sometimes I fear that unless&#xD;
I am shortly relieved from some of these causes of anxiety, I&#xD;
shall sink under their weight.&#xD;
"I have sat down by Emma's bedside to write to you; for,&#xD;
unless compelled by other duties, I have not left her since yes-&#xD;
terday morning, all which time she has been suffering extremely,&#xD;
and last evening I feared God would also require of me this child&#xD;
of my love, but now she is quietly sleeping, and I hope when she&#xD;
awakes that she will be better ; but should I now be obliged to&#xD;
yield her, dreadful indeed would be the blow. I should think I&#xD;
could not survive her, did I not know that the Judge of all the&#xD;
world does right, that he knows my infirmities, and that he will&#xD;
temper the wind to the shorn lamb !&#xD;
"I gave you all the news that I could hear of in my last let-&#xD;
ter ; and had I not done so, I am certain that I have not the&#xD;
spirits to write gossip now. My thoughts are all sad ones. I&#xD;
hope very soon to be relieved of my anxiety on your account.&#xD;
Even if you have written lately, I beg of you to answer this as&#xD;
soon as you receive it, and tell me if you have heard any thing of&#xD;
Jared. His profession is so full of danger and of death, that I&#xD;
am continually anxious about him. It is much comfort to me&#xD;
that I can put such entire faith in his stern, upright, and re-&#xD;
ligious principles, and- that I know that he has a Friend whose&#xD;
eye is ever upon him, and who will guide and guard him.&#xD;
"Emma has waked and sends her love to you, and says that if&#xD;
she gets well she will write to you by the first private oppor-&#xD;
tunity; but that though you would think otherwise, yet she&#xD;
knows that her letters would not be worth paying for. She is&#xD;
impatient for me to conclude my letter, as she requires me to&#xD;
bathe her feverish head ; but she won't consent for me to leave&#xD;
&#xD;
off until I have finished: so adieu, my dear boy ! that God may&#xD;
have you in his keeping, is the constant prayer of&#xD;
"Your affectionate aunt,      NANCY.&#xD;
CHAPTER       XL.&#xD;
The Christian may be made to meet&#xD;
Misfortune's saddest blow:&#xD;
His bosom is alive to feel&#xD;
The keenest pang of woe.-C. FRy.&#xD;
ABOUT a week after the date of the foregoing letter, as Miss&#xD;
Stanley was busily reading two letters from Richard, which, from&#xD;
one of them being delayed upon the road, had both come in the&#xD;
same mail to relieve her anxiety-and, at the same time, answering&#xD;
Emma's many questions with regard to her brother Richard, and&#xD;
listening to Miss Hoxie's lamentations that one of the letters was&#xD;
not from Jared-she heard a step close behind her, and, turning&#xD;
round, found herself clasped in the arms of her nephew Jared ;&#xD;
but she felt that tears, which manhood was not ashamed to shed,&#xD;
fell upon her cheek as he kissed her. Emma was boisterous in&#xD;
her joy ; for her sickness, though violent, was short, and she was&#xD;
now quite recovered. Jared wound his arm about her, and&#xD;
drawing her to him he kissed her silently. He grasped the hand&#xD;
of his old friend Miss Hoxie, and then answering to the anxious&#xD;
look of his aunt-" Linton, my dear friend," said he, and covered&#xD;
his face with his hand ; and it was some moments before he could&#xD;
repress the emotion caused by his so suddenly hearing of the&#xD;
demise of one whom he so truly loved. For he had not heard&#xD;
of it until, as he was going from the vessel up to his aunt's&#xD;
house, he had met his cousin Robert, who, being half intoxicated,&#xD;
and having heard of the intimacy of the two friends, with utter&#xD;
carelessness of what effect it might have upon Jared, called to&#xD;
him as he passed, after they had shaken hands, " Hollo, Jared,"&#xD;
said he, "I suppose you know that Linton is dead !"&#xD;
So sudden an announcement for a moment stunned him. He&#xD;
stopped as though he had received a violent blow, but quickly&#xD;
recovered himself, and then walked rapidly forward uitiIche&#xD;
reached the residence of his aunt ; but when he entered the&#xD;
house and saw her, the contending emotions of Joy and grief for&#xD;
a short time overcame his self-control, and the unbidden tears&#xD;
told how sincerely he had loved the departed.&#xD;
"I thought," said he, "to find him here ; I hoped to cheer his&#xD;

EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
List moments, and, instead of that, to be so heartlessly told of&#xD;
the fallacy of all those fond dreams, was almost more than I&#xD;
could bear." He then inquired every particular of his death,&#xD;
and was much soothed to hear of his happy end.&#xD;
His aunt told him of every circumstance, delivered to him&#xD;
Linton's last message, and also gave him the bequest that he&#xD;
had left him.&#xD;
" Ah ! well do I remember the evening that I first saw this&#xD;
picture," said he; "and this package, I presume, contains the&#xD;
recital of the cause of his melancholy."&#xD;
"I don't know," replied Miss Stanley. "He said nothing to&#xD;
me about reading it, and consequently I have left it to your dis-&#xD;
cretion whether or not I am to be acquainted with its contents.&#xD;
I am pretty well acquainted with them, if they are what you&#xD;
suspect, as he gave me a sketch of his life, and dwelt much upon&#xD;
the sad circumstances which undoubtedly shortened it. What-&#xD;
ever that may contain, however, the only time during his stay in&#xD;
my house, in which he showed all the despondency which for-&#xD;
merly characterized him, was while he was writing that, which&#xD;
it took him more than a week to do, for he commenced it after&#xD;
he had become too weak to write more than an hour at a time&#xD;
without complete exhaustion. I remonstrated with him one day&#xD;
on account of the injurious effect it had upon him both mentally&#xD;
and corporally. His reply was, that he had made you a prom-&#xD;
isc, and he could not die with ease unless it were performed.&#xD;
But do not read it now, Jared," she continued. "Defer it for a&#xD;
while, for I fear that it will add too heavy a burden to the grief&#xD;
that you already feel, and you must not unfit yourself for an in-&#xD;
troduction to those who yet claim me as their hostess."&#xD;
"Alas! I am not fit to-day for any society but yours ; can&#xD;
you not indulge me, and put off my introduction till to-morrow ?"&#xD;
"No, my son ! I will only exact your presence for a few&#xD;
moments, and I will neither bid you to be gay or cheerful be-&#xD;
yond your limits of self-control ; but I think it sinful to indulge&#xD;
immoderate grief, even for one who so well deserved to be&#xD;
mourned as your inestimable friend."&#xD;
"You are right, aunt, as you always are, though the task is&#xD;
a hard one."&#xD;
"I have felt its difficulty, and I only ask of y.ou the same trial&#xD;
through which I have passed."&#xD;
He obeyed her wishes, and supped with the whole family, but&#xD;
retired at an early hour to the room which his much-regretted&#xD;
Linton had occupied ; and for some time he paced its narrow&#xD;
hounds, and gave free vent to his grief. Then he recalled his&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA 8TANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
113&#xD;
&#xD;
aunt's words, that he was committing sin thus to sorrow, and he&#xD;
knelt by the bed where last had reposed the form of his friend,&#xD;
and prayed long and earnestly for resignation to bear his loss.&#xD;
He rose calm and refreshed, for when was prayer like that un-&#xD;
answered? He trimmed his lamp, and sitting down, unsealed&#xD;
the package and read as follows:&#xD;
CHAPTER       XLI.&#xD;
No cloud obscures the summer's sky,&#xD;
The moon in brightness walks on high,&#xD;
And set in azure, every star&#xD;
Shines like a gem oftheaven afar I-HEMxANs.&#xD;
"MY DEAR STANLEY :--&#xD;
"I have at length sat down to give you a history of that part&#xD;
of my life which cast a deep shadow over the remainder, and&#xD;
has hastened me onward to my narrow bed-to my immortal&#xD;
home!&#xD;
"How enduring are first impressions ! even now the form of&#xD;
Eveline Anthon, as I first saw it, is before me ; its freshness&#xD;
never fades from my memory.&#xD;
"There is no scene more beautiful than a wide expanse of&#xD;
water-to which you see no bound except the point from which&#xD;
you behold the scene-lighted by an unclouded moon, and all&#xD;
nature at rest. The stars of night, as they cast a look upon our&#xD;
planet, find their lovely faces faithfully mirrored in the waters&#xD;
beneath. All parts of creation seem to be holding sweet com-&#xD;
munion with each other, and in contemplating this scene of&#xD;
quietness the angry passions which often rend the soul are&#xD;
calmed, and nian is ready to exclaim to the Author of his being-&#xD;
Even I am at peace.&#xD;
"Just before hostilities last broke out between us and Great&#xD;
Britain, I was stationed with my regiment at Fort Seneca, and&#xD;
one day I joined a hunt with a party of brother officers, and the&#xD;
place of our chase was to the north of the fort. I, by some mis-&#xD;
chance, became separated from the rest of the company, and&#xD;
night found me with my jaded horse in a lone spot on the&#xD;
southern shore of Lake Erie ; I knew not where I was only by&#xD;
the direction and distance, and the'speed with which I had rid-&#xD;
den; I knew that it must be Lake Erie which was spread out&#xD;
so gloriously before me, and while adrmiringly contemp ating&#xD;
such a scene as I have but feebly described, my attentio was&#xD;

&#xD;
arrested by sounds so sweet, that it seemed as if some blessed&#xD;
being had chosen this secluded and lovely spot to warble the&#xD;
praises of its Creator. I dismounted, and turning round a little&#xD;
bay made by the lake, I found that the sound proceeded from a&#xD;
female, seated on a rock which overhung the waters. I unper-&#xD;
ceived drew near enough to distinguish these words of her song.&#xD;
'Shine on, shine on, thou gentle moon,&#xD;
And give to the waters thy fairest light;&#xD;
That the silver fishes which hide at noon,&#xD;
By the light of thine orb the hook may bite.&#xD;
'Shine on, shine on, thou evening star!&#xD;
For hrightis thy light, though soon to fade:&#xD;
Oh! borrow a ray from you world afar,&#xD;
To leave in thy place when thy journey's made.&#xD;
'Shine on, shine on, thou star ofnight!&#xD;
The mariner's guide o'er the trackless sea,&#xD;
To his bark on the water give steady light,&#xD;
And guide it safe to home and me'&#xD;
"I remained motionless until the song had ceased ; but when&#xD;
its last lingering cadence died upon my ear I approached and&#xD;
spoke.   Though apparently slightly alarmed at seeing me, Eve-&#xD;
line Anthon received me with grace and ease. She told me that&#xD;
her father had left her early in the day, and was yet on the lake&#xD;
fishing; that he must have been more than usually unsuccessful,&#xD;
as he did not return; and becoming anxious on his account, she&#xD;
had been tempted by the beauty of the night to await him there.&#xD;
She, however, offered to conduct me to her home, but I pre-&#xD;
ferred waiting there with her till the object of her anxiety should&#xD;
arrive. It was not long before her eager eye discovered a speck&#xD;
at a distance, which gradually increased in size, and proved to&#xD;
be the boat of the fisherman.&#xD;
Are you here so late and alone, my daughter?' said he, as&#xD;
he moored his bark in the little bay, at the end of which I was&#xD;
when I first heard his daughter's song.&#xD;
I am not alone, father,' she replied ; 'this gentleman has&#xD;
lost his way, and claims our hospitality for the night.' I have&#xD;
often read of silvery voices, but her voice, whether in singing or&#xD;
speaking, fell upon the ear in tones so soft and musical, that it&#xD;
might be compared to liquid pearls.&#xD;
"'Our hospitality is never refused to those who need it,' he&#xD;
answered ; 'and you, my friend,' turning to nme, 'shall be as&#xD;
welcome as rough fare and warm hearts can make you.' He&#xD;
fastened his boat as he spoke, and after he had gathered the&#xD;
fruits of his toil, we proceeded to his dwelling. It was a cottage&#xD;
standing almost on the margin of the lake.      We entered the&#xD;

small but neat parlor, and while Eveline was engaged in attentions&#xD;
to her father, I was enabled to contemplate her while her features&#xD;
were impressed with that spirit of love which had chosen her&#xD;
bosom for its shrine. She was rather above the middle height.&#xD;
Through her dark hair which hung upon her neck, appeared a&#xD;
skin unstained by sun or storm. Her cheek was pale, but the&#xD;
smile that rested upon it told that sorrow had not deprived it of&#xD;
its color. The many little wants of the old inan were anticipated&#xD;
and administered to by Eveline, and the smile that lighted up his&#xD;
aged features as he looked upon her, showed me that these two&#xD;
beings were bound together by a tie of no common affection. It&#xD;
has ever seemed to me, that to smooth the path of age with the&#xD;
attentions of youth, to give the expiring lamp of life the light&#xD;
and joy of its morning brightness, requires a spirit that has al-&#xD;
ready partaken much of the enduring meekness of the kingdom&#xD;
above ; for the kind offices performed by the young to the aged,&#xD;
are not to be recorded upon any other tablet than the heart of&#xD;
the receiver, and they are the purest offerings that mortals can&#xD;
bestow.&#xD;
"In casting my eyes around the parlor of Henry Anthon, I&#xD;
discovered many articles not common to the cottage of a fisher-&#xD;
man. A few mahogany chairs with sofa seats-a piano well&#xD;
furnished with music-most of the Fiench classics in their native&#xD;
tongue, occupying the shelves with all the English classics, gave&#xD;
evidence that the inmates of that humble dwelhng were worthy&#xD;
to associate with the magnates of the land.&#xD;
"Old Henry Anthon had retained in age and adversity the&#xD;
graceful bearing which distinguishes the gentle born, and although&#xD;
his store of this world's goods was evidently far less than it once&#xD;
had been, yet it was poured forth to all who needed with the&#xD;
same liberal hand.&#xD;
"We spent the evening in social converse, and I found that&#xD;
Eveline's beauty was heightened as her mind displayed its un-&#xD;
measured store. She had of late years led, as far as the society&#xD;
of the living was concerned, the life of a recluse ; but she had&#xD;
passed that time in the perusal of books well calculated to im-&#xD;
rove and entertain, and she was rich in intellectual lore. She&#xD;
was also the finest performer on the piano that I ever heard, and&#xD;
it was there, my dear Jared, on that memorable evening, that I&#xD;
heard the song, 'Soldier, rest,' &amp;amp;c., for the last time, before the&#xD;
evening on which you witnessed its effects when sung by your&#xD;
cousin. Methinks even now I can hear her sweet voice ringing&#xD;
in my ears! I drew her out upon every subject, and I found her&#xD;
equally at home upon all. Never have I found a female mind so&#xD;

richly stored with every thing worthy of being laid up as its&#xD;
treasure ; and in her father, too, I found one well able to make&#xD;
exchange with her of thought for thought. I lingered and en-&#xD;
joyed their society until I had been twice reminded that it was&#xD;
time to retire.&#xD;

"We hastened our march as much as possible, and on the&#xD;
second day after we received an accurate report of their position,&#xD;
came up within sight of their first sentinels. With how much&#xD;
agitation I trod that well-known ground, accompanied by all the&#xD;
pomp and circumstance of war, which scarcely two months be-&#xD;
fore I had first seen smiling in peace. By accurately noticing&#xD;
our position, I found, to my dismay, that we were scarcely two&#xD;
miles from Henry Anthon's cottage. ,As soon as we came up a&#xD;
skirmish ensued, which soon became a general battle. There&#xD;
were many Englishmen with the Indians, and they animated the&#xD;
courage of the latter, and kept up the battle until not more&#xD;
than a fourth of them remained; but still they retreated slowly,&#xD;
until--oh, horror of horrors !-Henry Anthon's cottage became&#xD;
their bulwark of defence. At that instant, by the death of my&#xD;
two superior officers, I became the commander of the army : I&#xD;
felt the fury of the tiger raging in my breast, as I saw several of&#xD;
the India'ns enter the cottage. I exhorted the men of my own&#xD;
regiment by one scream of agonizing wildness to save the in-&#xD;
mates. I rushed into the house, followed by about twenty of&#xD;
my men. At first I saw Indians only ; but I heard a groan issue&#xD;
from the other room, followed by a shriek whose soul-piercing&#xD;
tone can never pass from my memory. As I darted forward,&#xD;
several of the Indians attempted to prevent me; but they might&#xD;
as well have attempted to stop the waters of Niagara from&#xD;
sweeping over their rocky barrier by pressing their fingers&#xD;
against its sheet of foam. I killed the two foremost, rushed&#xD;
passed the rest, and entered the room which I sought, just as&#xD;
Henry Anthon expired from having the scalp torn from his head:&#xD;
I saw at a glance that the wound was mortal-that he was at&#xD;
rest, and that Eveline was struggling to free herself from the&#xD;
rasp of an Englishman, whose hated arm was entwining her&#xD;
form, and who had hoped to bear her with him in his retreat.&#xD;
My musket had been wrested from me by the Indians, but I&#xD;
sheathed my sword in his heart. Eveline looked up to see who&#xD;
was her deliverer, and gave an exclamation of recognition, and&#xD;
then, had I not caught her, would have sunk upon the lifeless&#xD;
body of her father. The Indians, being entirely routed and their&#xD;
chief slain, upon hearing that I had killed their British leader,&#xD;
raised their cry of retreat, and took to precipitate flight.&#xD;
"I remained for a few moments irresolute how to proceed. To&#xD;
leave the still insensible Eveline was ,impossible, and still I&#xD;
doubted if it were not my duty to pursue the enemy ; but as it&#xD;
was now nearly sunset, I determined to sacrifice the small ad-&#xD;
vantage that we might possibly gain in the pursuit, and to en-&#xD;

&#xD;
camp where we were. I accordingly gave orders to that effect.&#xD;
I carried Eveline into another room. I procured some water,&#xD;
and chafed her temples until she gave signs of returning anima-&#xD;
tion. She at length opened her eyes and gazed upon me ; but&#xD;
oh, my God ! it was with the vacant stare of an idiot--the blow&#xD;
which had deprived her father of life, had bereft her of reason.&#xD;
She sat silent, as though not gifted with speech or motion, with&#xD;
her hands crossed meekly on her breast and her eyes bent upon&#xD;
the floor, until the moon rose bright and clear; then, as if that&#xD;
scene had touched some chord of her mind to which memory&#xD;
answered, she rose and walked from the cottage. I spoke to&#xD;
her as she stepped from the door. She stopped a moment,&#xD;
and then, as if fear had lent her wings, she flew rather than ran&#xD;
from my sight. Thinking she would probably stop on the well-&#xD;
known rock where I had first seen her, I bent my steps towards&#xD;
it. I approached as noiselessly as possible ; but before I reached&#xD;
it I heard her singing the words of the same song which had first&#xD;
drawn my steps towards her. She ceased. I crept near her to&#xD;
observe her face. It was deadly pale, but lighted up with hope&#xD;
and joy. The vacant stare of idiocy was gone, and a smile again&#xD;
played upon her features; but I knew as I gazed that it was&#xD;
brought to her cheek by some fond illusion. She bent her head&#xD;
a moment as if listening to catch some passing sound.  'I come,&#xD;
my father!  She sprang forward-I saw her white dress flutter&#xD;
in the breeze ; but before I could reach the spot, the placid&#xD;
waters of the lake, as it lay sleeping in the calm moonshine, had&#xD;
closed forever over that pure being, and I was on that rocky&#xD;
shore-alone !&#xD;
Oh, the agony of that moment-of that night of woe! It was&#xD;
as if the wretchedness of a whole life had been compressed into&#xD;
a few hours, which were to leave their record upon my heart in&#xD;
burning characters of hopeless grief. I made the echoes round&#xD;
me ring with the name of Eveline ; but her spirit had flown to a&#xD;
happier sphere. At length I rose from the ground on which I&#xD;
had thrown myself, and walked rapidly onward-I knew not, cared&#xD;
not whither. I was soon, however, challenged by one of our own&#xD;
sentinels. I pronounced my name and entered the cottage. I&#xD;
roamed from room to room until the morning, when the active&#xD;
duties of life came to call me to myself. I gave orders for the&#xD;
main body of our forces to return towards Fort Seneca, and sent&#xD;
out a party of men to gain what further intelligence they could&#xD;
respecting the Indians ; but as we left the cottage I made some&#xD;
of my men set it on fire, for I could not bear the thought of any&#xD;
other touching what the presence of Eveline had hallowed. But&#xD;

ch what a burden did I bear away at my own heart! Can you&#xD;
picture my madness to yourself? Yes, for you can imagine&#xD;
what you would have felt had such been the fate of Isabelle; for&#xD;
in our heart Love has touched the same master chord, which&#xD;
never fails to give a responsive echo. Throughout the last of the&#xD;
war I courted every dangerous post, I was ever found in the&#xD;
thickest of the fight, and I tried in vain to throw away my life;&#xD;
but death repulsed my advances. My comrades often fell around&#xD;
me, but I was left standing; and more than once have I hewn&#xD;
my way through a body of the enemy, who would give way be-&#xD;
fore me as if I were a spirit that they feared. I was twice upon&#xD;
the battle-field offered promotion for my bravery, but I refused&#xD;
it ; for what had I to do with any of the rewards for which am-&#xD;
bition thirsts?  I preferred a rank where. I was free to meet the&#xD;
death that I sought.&#xD;
"At the close of the war, finding no relief to my despair, for I&#xD;
had not learned to look above for hope, I asked a furlough for a&#xD;
year on the plea of ill health, which wasreadily granted me. I&#xD;
went to London, and in that proud city I sought a while to forget&#xD;
myself ; but I found it impossible, and I determined to return to&#xD;
America. I, however, concluded to go to Liverpool and take&#xD;
passage from thence. I thank God that he so ordered my go-&#xD;
ings that I selected the ship of which you were mate. You know&#xD;
the rest !&#xD;
"Farewell, my dear Stanley ! for when you see this the heart&#xD;
whose agony it portrays will have ceased to beat, and the hand&#xD;
that has written it will be mouldering in the dust. Farewell!&#xD;
by the blessing of God, to you I owe the hope of soon meeting&#xD;
Eveline, never more to be separated from her; but while I linger&#xD;
here, my fondest wishes,. my warmest hopes, my most fervent&#xD;
prayers, will be for you. That the God whom you, worship-&#xD;
the God of the fatherless-may be your protector and guide, is&#xD;
the trust and prayer of&#xD;

"AD how do I find my dear Jared ?" said Mrs. Chapman,&#xD;
as she called at Miss Stanley's the morning after Jared's return.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6673-00000061"/>&#xD;

&#xD;
"I little thought that I should ever be forced to make you the&#xD;
first call upon your arrival."&#xD;
"Nor would you," he replied, "had I not got into a very in-&#xD;
teresting discussion with aunt Nancy, which made me take my&#xD;
seat just as I was otherwise ready to call upon you. But how&#xD;
did you hear that I had arrived ?"&#xD;
"As Emma was passing to school she called to inform me of&#xD;
it, as she always makes me a participator in her joys. As I&#xD;
was obliged to visit a sick neighbor this morning, I went imme-&#xD;
diately; and finding my services not essential, I excused myself,&#xD;
and came to honor you with a call."&#xD;
"I really feel myself much honored by the visit, and during&#xD;
the period of my stay here, will endeavor to make you many in&#xD;
return."&#xD;
"And I," said Miss Stanley, "am not only grateful for the&#xD;
honor Mrs. Chapman has conferred upon you, but am relieved&#xD;
by her presence of my part of the argument, as I will gladly re-&#xD;
linquish it into her hands, knowing that she will espouse my side.&#xD;
of the question."&#xD;
"Perhaps not," said Mrs. Chapman, "for my well-known&#xD;
partiality for Jared, and my joy at his return, will both conduce&#xD;
to weaken my opposition to any thing that he might now ad-&#xD;
vance."&#xD;
"Ah no !" said Miss Stanley, "such feelings influence me,&#xD;
but you are not weak enough to feel their power."&#xD;
" Alas ! I have all the frailties of our nature with which to&#xD;
contend, and I am often overcome by its weaknesses ; but tell me,&#xD;
what is the mighty subject of debate between your nephew and&#xD;
yourself?"&#xD;
"We have been arguing about half an hour upon the subjects&#xD;
of pride and ambition ; and as I find that I gain no advantage&#xD;
over him, I will gladly turn him over to you ; and I hope you&#xD;
will manage him more easily."&#xD;
"And is it fair," said Jared, "after I have been arguing so&#xD;
long, to turn me over to a new opponent ?"&#xD;
"Yes," replied Miss Stanley, "perfectly so ; for I think your&#xD;
opinions so heretical that any means are fair if, they will vanquish&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"I never do evil that good may come," said Mrs. Chapman,&#xD;
smiling ; "but still," she continued, turning to Jared, "I would&#xD;
like to hear you explain your own ideas of the difference be-&#xD;
tween ambition and pride."&#xD;
"I think," said he, "that pride is an overweening idea of our&#xD;
own excellentee; ambition, I think, a wish to form our character&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR TILE ORPHANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
according to some standard of superior excellence, which we&#xD;
have set up in our own mind. Sometimes it is displayed in the&#xD;
cultivation of native talent ; sometimes in acquiring knowledge.&#xD;
Sometimes it directs its views to glory, and then I grant its views&#xD;
are often erroneous; and in order to gratify its desires, means&#xD;
are embraced which lead to the most direful results: but still its&#xD;
aims are high and noble."&#xD;
"We differ in our ideas of ambition. To me it appears nei-&#xD;
ther more nor less than the ebullition of an ardent, aspiring tem-&#xD;
per, aiming at high distinction in some favorite path, and heed-&#xD;
lessly trampling on the rights of others for its own elevation."&#xD;
And do you not think ambition a powerful ingredient in the&#xD;
formation of superior excellence of character ?"&#xD;
"Superior excellence of character, in my view, consists not in&#xD;
a brilliant display of native talent, or acquired knowledge'; not in&#xD;
arrogantly seeking to shine above the less-gifted portion of our&#xD;
frail race, but in a deep consciousness of human weakness-an&#xD;
humble sense of dependence on the Most High for all that we&#xD;
have and are, and an acknowledgment of our sacred obligation&#xD;
to employ all our talents for his service and to his glory."&#xD;
"Do you not think that superior talents raise us above our&#xD;
fellows ? and do you not think them placed in our hands for&#xD;
improvement, for which we shall have to account? and do you&#xD;
not think it natural for us to be proud of the distinction which&#xD;
they give to us ?"&#xD;
"I think they are certainly bestowed upon us for improve-&#xD;
ment ; but ought we not rather to use them for the Redeemer's&#xD;
cause, than for worldly aggrandizement? And when pride whis-&#xD;
pers, I am wiser, or better, or greater than another, would it not&#xD;
be prudent to ask, Who made us to differ? Not to urge the&#xD;
arrogant boast, I have so much-but rather to ask, To what good&#xD;
purpose have I improved my little? Were, the intellectual al-&#xD;
ways free from blemish, they would have rather more cause for&#xD;
pride ; but how often do we see splendid attainments in litera-&#xD;
ture, station, and worldly honors, allied to blemishes of so dark&#xD;
a shade, as jo eclipse, if not destroy, their fancied greatness !"&#xD;
"I grant the justice of your last remark ; but in such persons&#xD;
it has always seemed to me that the striving after the fame which&#xD;
they attained, was the one bright spot in their character which&#xD;
saved it from being all dark ; and I have rejoiced in the ambition&#xD;
which urged them onward."&#xD;
"Suffer me to remind you that the molt perfect character in&#xD;
human form was meek and lowly."&#xD;

"And do you not think that motives of a higher order might&#xD;
act with equal urgency upon an ingenuous and well-regulated&#xD;
mind, for the fulfilment of all the duties required of us ?"&#xD;
"Perhaps they might for the duties ; for I have ever consid-&#xD;
ered duty as a word which required a nature rather cold, in or-&#xD;
der never to swerve from its commands. Such a temperament&#xD;
as leads to acts that dazzle, is too seldom sufficiently calm to fol-&#xD;
low its lead."&#xD;
" And to which do you give the preference ?"&#xD;
"I must confess that I admire most the brilliant."&#xD;
" What- when it leads to error?   You certainly are not&#xD;
aware what unlimited power of reproof your last admission con-&#xD;
fers. Are you not sensible of the aptitude of age to assume lib-&#xD;
erties of advice, and even dictation, where affection prompts&#xD;
and seniority of years (as they may imagine) necessarily sup-&#xD;
poses larger experience, if not superior wisdom ?"&#xD;
"Yes, and from you I am always willing to receive reproof,&#xD;
confident that at the same time I shall also receive instruction."&#xD;
"Ah, when you flatter, you disarm me ; and your implied de-&#xD;
sire to receive my correction takes from me the power to be-&#xD;
stow it."&#xD;
"That is not the effect which I wished : I lay open my&#xD;
thoughts without reserve, and I wish you to be as candid in&#xD;
communicating your own sentiments ; for be assured I have no&#xD;
mental reserve-in talking to you."&#xD;
"You are willing, then, that I should assume the character&#xD;
of your monitress ?"&#xD;
"Entirely willing."&#xD;
"Will you tell me if you have ever followed duty ?"&#xD;
"I think I may say without vanity that it has been my&#xD;
watchword through life ; that its name has been a magic sound&#xD;
to lead me onward through trials and troubles of no ordinary&#xD;
nature."&#xD;
"Have you found it always an easy task to follow its lead ?"&#xD;
"Sometimes it has been much the contrary ; but yet I&#xD;
hate endeavored unswervingly to follow the path she pointed&#xD;
out."&#xD;
"And yet, if I mistake not, you ire of a nature warm, sensi-&#xD;
tive, and highly imaginative, ardent, and aspiring ; but I would&#xD;
neither call you ambitious nor proud, for I think the excellencies&#xD;
at which you aim are of that order which belong to those cold,&#xD;

calm temperaments of which you spoke. Ah, Jared, Jared, I&#xD;
think you are fairly vanquished by your own confessions."&#xD;
"Well, my dear madam, I know of no one to whom I would&#xD;
more readily accord the palm of victory ; but it does not follow&#xD;
that I should not admire a nature like my own."&#xD;
"It follows that one, who has duty for his watchword, must&#xD;

Her breast expands with generous warmth&#xD;
A stranger's woes to feel ;&#xD;
And bleeds in pity o'er the wound&#xD;
She wants the power to heal.-BAAvrn.&#xD;
EMMA's partiality for pets developed itself upon all occasions,&#xD;
and to all quadrupeds. To have four feet was as strong a hold&#xD;
upon her sympathies as to be infirm or aged, with only two.&#xD;
Let an object of either kind present itself before her, and she&#xD;
knew no rest until she had shown by some act of kindness the&#xD;
friendship which they awakened. Being born on the eighth day&#xD;
of the month, she always gave as an excuse for her sometimes&#xD;
unwarranted partiality, that she could not help it ; for did it not&#xD;
say in the Bible, that she was to "open her mouth for the&#xD;
dumb ?" and she only did that ; for she thought that the verse&#xD;
meant that she was not only to plead for those who could not&#xD;
plead for themselves, but she ought to aid them as much as her&#xD;
limited means and weak abilities gave her power. Such propen-&#xD;
sities, however, brought her into frequent contests with Miss&#xD;
Hoxie ; but Emma was usually victorious. Not only her cats&#xD;
claimed her attention, but she also had a favorite dog, named&#xD;
Acasto, which had been given her by her brother Richard, just&#xD;
before his departure for the South. Acasto, however, was not&#xD;
the only frequenter of the kitchen ; for Emma was as universal a&#xD;
favorite of the dogs as they were of her. All the canine race of&#xD;
the neighborhood had found out that if they went to Miss Stan-&#xD;
ley's kitchen, they would certainly get something to eat; for if&#xD;
Emma were there, she would feed them, and if she were absent,&#xD;
Miss Hoxie would feed them for Emma's sake, and would scold&#xD;
at them all the time they were eating.&#xD;
Emma was one day dancing about the kitchen with the cat&#xD;
upon her'shoulder, for that was Toney's favorite and privileged&#xD;
seat: Miss Hoxie, who was watching her with looks of fond affec-&#xD;
tion, at length drew a deep sigh, and so unusual a thing as a&#xD;

&#xD;
sigh from Miss Hoxie, made Emma dance up to her and ask her&#xD;
if she were sick.&#xD;
"No, child," she replied.&#xD;
"What then is the matter ?" asked Emma.&#xD;
"Dance on, child. I was once as merry and light-hearted as&#xD;
ye are when ye're well, and I was thinking over old times, when&#xD;
I was a child like ye, and hoping that ye might never have any&#xD;
sorrow to make ye as dull as ye see me now.'&#xD;
Miss Hoxie, does every one have sorrow ?" asked the child,&#xD;
mournfully; for the words of the old lady had at once changed&#xD;
her gavety to seriousness.&#xD;
"I never heard of any body without some ; but some folks&#xD;
have more than others, and I sometimes think that I have had a&#xD;
double share."&#xD;
Emma stood thoughtfully silent for a few, moments--" Aunt&#xD;
Nancy says, that if any one is good they will be happy! Why&#xD;
then are you not happy?  Are you not good ?"&#xD;
But Miss Hoxie was not willing to bear such catechising from&#xD;
a child, even though that child was Emma. She was not will-&#xD;
ing to own her faults, and she was too conscious of them to pro-&#xD;
fess that she was free from them. She therefore took refuge in&#xD;
her accustomed exclamation of, "Hold yere tongue, Emma !&#xD;
Hold yere tongue ! and go to yere dancing !"&#xD;
But the idea that Miss Hoxie was unhappy, an idea that had&#xD;
never before crossed her mind, took from her any inclination to&#xD;
continue her boisterous amusement. She sat down wondering&#xD;
what could be the cause of Miss Hoxie being unhappy. She&#xD;
was too young to know that wilfulness, waywardness, and un-&#xD;
restrained temper, were sufficient causes to make any one un-&#xD;
happy, particularly if accompanied by poverty. She knew,&#xD;
however, that it would be in vain to say more to the old lady&#xD;
now, after she had uttered what was to her the concluding&#xD;
phrase, " Hold yere tongue !" for after that had once escaped&#xD;
her lips, it was a rare thing for her to continue the subject.&#xD;
Emma, therefore, sat down at a little distance from her and be-&#xD;
gan to fondle her cat. She had sat so but a few moments, when&#xD;
two or three dogs, with Acasto as leader, came chasing each&#xD;
other into the room. Acasto quickly found- out his mistress,&#xD;
and began to bound and gambol round her, and the others fol-&#xD;
lowed his example. She was too much of a child long to in-&#xD;
dulge in melancholy reflections, and she entered into their frolic&#xD;
with hearty good will; but the sadness of the aged is not so&#xD;
easily dissipated. Miss Hoxie's spirit was communing with by-&#xD;
gone times, and the mirth of Emma and her favorites jarred&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANs.&#xD;
&#xD;
125&#xD;
&#xD;
upon a chord of memory sacred to the dead, and it vibrated&#xD;
harshly to their noise. She awoke tothe present; but when&#xD;
she spoke, her language was dictated by the querulousness of&#xD;
age, which makes no allowance for the thoughtlessness of youth.&#xD;
"Yes !" said she, "here they come-it's most supper time !&#xD;
There's Carlo Sornston, and Mischief Hazard, and Fido Mercer,&#xD;
and Pomp Starr (thus appending to the name of the dogs the&#xD;
surname of their masters). All get their living out of this&#xD;
kitchen ! Come along, wretches! and let me feed ye, and then&#xD;
go home." As she spoke, she emptied at the door a plate of&#xD;
bones, which she had evidently put away for "the wretches.&#xD;
"There, eat them," she continued, "and now growl and fight&#xD;
over 'em; for if I was to give ye every thing in the house, ye&#xD;
could not eat in peace. What are ye quarreling about, ye Casto&#xD;
Stanley? Come here, wretch, I'll feed ye by yourself, if ye'll&#xD;
only have patience. Ye Pomp Starr, stop yere growling. Ain't&#xD;
ye willing for any body to eat but yourself? Now Carlo Sorn-&#xD;
ston, ye must begin, must ye? Mischief Hazard and Fido Mer-&#xD;
cer are the only ones on ye that has got any sense or manners;&#xD;
for they eat in peace, and get the best of it, while the rest of ye&#xD;
are quarrelling and fighting. Well! if ye've eat up all that, and&#xD;
ain't satisfied yet, here's some bread for ye, if that'll do ye any&#xD;
good." So saying, she continued to feed and scold, until she&#xD;
thought they had enough, when she called Acasto, and gave to&#xD;
him the choicest bit, which she had reserved for him alone.&#xD;

"My DEAR JARED&#xD;
"I have sat down to obey your injunction of writing to you, so&#xD;
that you may receive it by the time you get home, and of writing&#xD;
about myself. With regard to the first, this will probably reach&#xD;
Newport by the middle of September, unless it stops to sleep&#xD;
upon the road, which I believe many of my letters do, as aunt&#xD;
Nancy often complains of not receiving one for some time, and&#xD;
then having two at a time to repay her for waiting ; but in a&#xD;
new country the mails are generally irregular, so we must put&#xD;
up with such kind of inconveniences. But, in giving myself as&#xD;
my subject for composition, you have selected what I never yet&#xD;
could fill a sheet about. You tell me to write about my situa-&#xD;

Lion and prospects. As for my prospects, they are to continue&#xD;
just as I am, until something unforeseen happens, fo vary my&#xD;
present life. As for my situation, you know how long I have&#xD;
been here, and I have enjoyed during both summers better&#xD;
health than I ever had in my life ; so I have, fortunately, no ter-&#xD;
rible attacks of sickness and no hair-breadth escapes to relate,&#xD;
and my employment admits of little variety. The clerk of a&#xD;
drygoods store sees about the same things one day that he does&#xD;
another, and nothing is worth writing of; but, fortunately, you&#xD;
gave me permission to speak of all those in whom I was inter-&#xD;
ested, and there is one person here, an old acquaintance, and one&#xD;
particularly partial to yourself, who would be delighted to see&#xD;
you-no other than Dr. Blustermeath. About two weeks ago,&#xD;
I went down on board a barge which had just arrived, and who&#xD;
should I find seated in the cabin but the old doctor. I was very&#xD;
glad to see him, for I should claim as a friend a negro or a dog&#xD;
that I had once seen in Newport. I accordingly went up with&#xD;
joy to shake hands with him; but he drew back from my prof-&#xD;
fered hand with the air of a prince. 'Young gentleman!' said&#xD;
he, in his most pompous manner, 'you are mistaken in the per-&#xD;
son to whom you are speaking ; for I certainly never saw you&#xD;
before.' 'My name,' said I, 'is Stanley, from Newport, RhoJe&#xD;
Island.' ' Stanley !' said he, with an affected air of astonishment,&#xD;
'I never heard it.' 'Is not your name Dr. Blustermeath ?' said&#xD;
I. 'No,' said he. ''Tis true I am a physician, and have per-&#xD;
formed some wonderful cures ; but my name is Wayland.' I saw&#xD;
"that he was determined not to know me ; but yet I was confident&#xD;
that no two men could be so much alike as he and Dr. Bluster-&#xD;
meath, and not be the same ; but I turned from him and was&#xD;
going away, when he hallooed after me. 'Young man!' said&#xD;
he, 'as we have by mistake become acquainted, I should be glad&#xD;
to see you at the tavern this evening.' 'I will call,' I replied,&#xD;
and left him. Just after supper I called, and inquired for him.&#xD;
I was introduced into his room, and after he had locked the door,&#xD;
he came up to me and shook me warmly by the hand. 'I am&#xD;
glad to see you, Richard!' said he, 'very glad ; but the reason&#xD;
I did not recognize you was, I now go by the name of Wayland,&#xD;
and you called me Blustermeath. I have come out to this savage&#xD;
country, to practice medicine among these barbarians, and while&#xD;
I am here I am determined, as much as possible, to forget my&#xD;
name, and every thing north of the Potomac.' He begged me&#xD;
to keep his secret, and not to permit any one to know that I had&#xD;
ever seen him before. He then asked me particularly about&#xD;
you--spoke of you in the most exalted terms, and we continued&#xD;
&#xD;
in conversation until it was time to separate for the night. He&#xD;
did not tell me the reason of his leaving the north ; but I strongly&#xD;
suspect, from his appearance, that it was poverty. l  d&#xD;
"But to return to my own affairs. I continue as well pleased&#xD;
with this country as I should with any that was not home; but&#xD;
the very word home has a magic in its sound which stirs my&#xD;
soul to its inmost depths. I sometimes think that I would give&#xD;
worlds to revisit my native shores ; but as I have no definite&#xD;
idea when I shall do so, I try to banish such discontenting&#xD;
thoughts. You know that it has always been the leading article&#xD;
of my philosophical creed to enjoy the present, and to have as&#xD;
little as possible to do with the past and future.afo&#xD;
"I wish with all my heart that you would give me a call, r&#xD;
I seem to be too much of a fixture here for there to be any&#xD;
probability of my seeing you unless you do ; but I would not&#xD;
recommend you to leave the sea, unless you an engage with&#xD;
some one who has a considerable capital; for t country is like&#xD;
all others, it requires a beginning, and nothing can be done vith-&#xD;
out it. It is true that more money is to be made here than in&#xD;
Newport, but there is also more to be spent, and on the whole&#xD;
there is not half the difference that one would imagine. As I&#xD;
have made a beginning here under the capital of others, I hope&#xD;
to go gradually on acquiring one for myself, until I have a house&#xD;
of my own, to which I shall insist upon aunt Nancy and Emma&#xD;
both coming to be occupants, and by that means I shall secure&#xD;
your company sometimes as a visitor ; but I fear that time is at&#xD;
least some years distant, so I should rejoice to see you before&#xD;
that event with joy unspeakable, but I fear to urge your coming&#xD;
as a resident, lest you should regret it. tCata*nLinton&#xD;

Linton was no more ; but as Richard expressed it, it had slept&#xD;
upon the road, for it was the middle of October before it came&#xD;

CHAPTER XLVI.&#xD;
Can riches purchase health or peace,&#xD;
Is life the gtft of gold,&#xD;
That I should barter soul and ease ?-J. K. MITCHEL.&#xD;
BUT while these varied events of joy and sorrow were passing&#xD;
in the house of Miss Stanley, Mr. Witherington was as usual en-&#xD;
gaged in the affairs of the world, in adding to that fortune&#xD;
which was already sufficient ; and though disappointed in his&#xD;
schemes of ambition, he had too much the habit of acquiring for&#xD;
that to retard his efforts. But to his cost he found that specu-&#xD;
lations are not always successful, and as the tide of fortune flows,&#xD;
so, sooner or later, it will surely ebb. The whole business had&#xD;
of late become to many a golden vision, and all who had capital&#xD;
were eager to embark in a scheme which they thought promised&#xD;
so abundant a harvest ; and' among all the merchants of New-&#xD;
port, none entered more largely into it than Mr. Witherington.&#xD;
He had hitherto been so successful that he began to think that&#xD;
whatever he undertook must of course prosper, and that his&#xD;
name was a charm which fortune followed. He feared no ad-&#xD;
verse gales. He did not condescend to hope for aught, but ar-&#xD;
rogantly determined that every thing must be as he wished.&#xD;
With such feelings, and the prospect of overwhelming wealth&#xD;
before his eyes, he risked the gross of his capital in the whaling&#xD;
business. Three new ships destined to the Pacific were manned&#xD;
by his orders, and for his gain were breasting the waves in&#xD;
search of those monsters of the deep. After they had been gone&#xD;
about two years, he received, by the return of a whale-ship that&#xD;
had gone out before them, a letter which gave him  he unfortu-&#xD;
nate tidings, that in the outward passage two of them had be-&#xD;
come a wreck. They had encountered a violent storm off the&#xD;
southern shore of Greenland. One of them had sprung a leak,&#xD;
from some defect either in its building or its timbers, and had&#xD;
foundered at sea. A portion of the crew were saved, and&#xD;
divided between the other two ships. The other one that was&#xD;
lost had encountered an iceberg, and had gone to the bottom,&#xD;
and every soul on board had perished. Mr. Witherington read&#xD;
the letter, and immediately went on board the vessel which had&#xD;
brought it, and asked the captain if he knew any thing of the&#xD;
other ships, besides the one from which he got the letter. The&#xD;
captain told him that he had not come across any of the ships,&#xD;
and that he knew nothing of them ; that the letter which he had&#xD;
sent him had been found in a bottle which one of his crew picked&#xD;
&#xD;
128&#xD;
&#xD;
up as it was floating past them; that besides the letter was a&#xD;
record of the latitude and longitude in which the vessel was&#xD;
when they had thrown the bottle overboard, with an entry of&#xD;
the health of the crew, and a request to whoever should pick up&#xD;
the bottle that they would give or send the letter it contained&#xD;
according to its direction ; that he had accordingly taken charge&#xD;
of the letter, and as he was then homeward bound, that he had&#xD;
kept it until that morning. Mr. Witherington thanked him and&#xD;
returned home. He found Mr. Thorn at his house when he ar-&#xD;
rived. After conversing a short time, Mr. Thorn told him that&#xD;
he had some business with him, and said he would like to see&#xD;
him in the library. When they were seated, Mr. Thorn said&#xD;
that he had some news to communicate which would be dis-&#xD;
agreeable if not distressing to him. That by the return-°of a&#xD;
whale-ship which had got into New Haven two days before, he&#xD;
had received a letter from one of Mr. Witherington's ships which&#xD;
informed him of the loss of both the others.&#xD;
"I have myself just heard of it," replied Mr. Witherington,&#xD;
"but I hope that you have not mentioned it to any one of my&#xD;
family, or to any one in the world."&#xD;
"You are the first," he replied, "to whom I have mentioned&#xD;
it at all."&#xD;
"Then I beg of you to keep it a profound secret, not to men-&#xD;
tion it to your dearest friend, for at least two weeks, and never&#xD;
to let any one know of the period at which you have heard the&#xD;
intelligence."&#xD;
"I will probably comply with your request, upon condition&#xD;
that you tell me why you are so urgent for me never to say&#xD;
when I heard the news; for though I can imagine a reason why&#xD;
you should not wish it immediately known, I can conceive of&#xD;
none why you should wish the period of my hearing of it always&#xD;
kept a secret."&#xD;
Mr. Witherington looked upon the fine open browtof the&#xD;
young man as if he feared to confess his motive, but the thought,&#xD;
he is a lawyer, crossed his mind, and decided him; for, said he&#xD;
to himself, he sees the dark side of human nature, and will not&#xD;
wonder at my scheme. " Because," he replied, "Mr, Hobson&#xD;
yesterday made me the offer of buying out one of those very&#xD;
ships of which I have just heard the loss, and I intend to make&#xD;
him confirm the bargain to-day, and I shall want you to draw&#xD;
the deeds."&#xD;
Mr. Thorn gazed upon him with astonishmentm: he could not&#xD;
believe that he had, heard aright. "Am I not mistaken, Mr.&#xD;
Witheregton," said he, "in what I have heard? Is it possible&#xD;

that you can wish to sell Mr. Hobson a piece of property which&#xD;
you know is at the bottom of the sea, and make him pay for it&#xD;
the same value that it would be worth if its white sails were&#xD;
floating to the breeze ?"&#xD;
Mr. Witherington was offended at the reproving tone in which&#xD;
young Thorn had spoken.  "It is possible !" he replied, "and&#xD;
unless you will consent to my proposal, you must relinquish all&#xD;
pretensions to the hand of my daughter."&#xD;
"I love your daughter," he replied, "with an honorable love,&#xD;
and I could not become an accessory to an act of the kind you&#xD;
propose to obtain that daughter's hand !"&#xD;
And you give her up rather than to keep my secret ?"&#xD;
"Most assuredly, sir ! I should by it feel my soul stained by&#xD;
dishonor, and I should never dare to lift my eyes to the face of&#xD;
that pure being for whose sake I had encountered the disgrace,&#xD;
for I should fear that she would see it in, every lineament of my&#xD;
face, and she would reprobate the act, and despise the actor."&#xD;
He had spoken boldly, and he had raised the wrath of Mr.&#xD;
Witherington to its highest pitch. Twice while he was speaking&#xD;
had he raised his hand to strike, but he had forborne from the&#xD;
conviction that one who had spoken so fearlessly would be little&#xD;
likely tamely to endure a blow ; but when he ceased, Mr. Wither-&#xD;
ington walked to the door of the library-" Go out !" said he to&#xD;
Thorn i a voice of thunder, "and the first time I find you in&#xD;
my house again a horsewhipping shall repay your insolence, and&#xD;
should you dare to run away with HarrietI will lay her a corpse&#xD;
at your feet !"&#xD;
Thorn had risen to go ; but he stopped and confronted him,&#xD;
as he slowly and sternly said-" I would never condescend to in-&#xD;
duce a daughter to leave her father's house without his consent,&#xD;
even though that father be a villain !" He then slowly walked&#xD;
from the house.&#xD;

wardly cursed the knowledge that Thorn had acquired; cursed&#xD;
the confidence that he had reposed in him, and still more the&#xD;
misfortune that had overtaken the vessels. He bestowed not a&#xD;
thought upon those unfortunate men who had in them found a&#xD;
grave. He only felt that a great part of his fortune had sunk&#xD;
with th m, and unless some fortunate event occurred to repair his&#xD;
loss, tha' he would be obliged to descend somewhat from that&#xD;
eminence above his fellow-men to which only his fortune had&#xD;
raised him. Such reflections passing through his mind, only&#xD;
served to increase the feelings of revenge with which he was dis-&#xD;
posed to regard Mr. Thorn. He looked upon him as, in a great&#xD;
measure, the cause of his fall from a station which it had cost&#xD;
him the labor of a life to attain; and he determined to revenge&#xD;
himself upon him-as deeply as he could. He was engaged in&#xD;
business all day, and when he went home at night he inquired&#xD;
of Harriet if Mr. Thorn had returned to her, after accompanying&#xD;
him into the library. She replied that he had not.&#xD;
"Well! my daughter," said he, with more than usual tenderness&#xD;
in his manner, "you will never see him again, and you have&#xD;
made /a lucky escape from the hands of a mercenary villain.&#xD;
Forget him, my daughter, forget that you have ever seen one who&#xD;
only wished to marry you for the fortune that he thought to ac-&#xD;
quire with your hand."&#xD;
" Oh ! say not so, my father ! He is all that is good and&#xD;
noble : he could not be so base !"&#xD;
"Listen," said he, sternly, "and I will convince you of his&#xD;
baseness. This morning I received news of the loss of two of&#xD;
my whale-ships, and with them, Harriet, I have sunk a large&#xD;
amount of capital; I showed him the letter while we were in the&#xD;
library, and he appeared to be so very much astonished at its&#xD;
contents, that I told him that perhaps it might make some differ-&#xD;
ence in his matrimonial views, to know that that misfortune would&#xD;
preclude the possibility of my giving my daughters any thing&#xD;
worth mentioning when they were married. In a roundabout&#xD;
manner, after a good deal of hesitancf, he stammered out that&#xD;
surely he had never expected to take you portionless. I told&#xD;
him that you should never be thrust upon any one ; that he&#xD;
might, if it so pleased him, consider himself free from all engage-&#xD;
ment to you; but that if he thus intended to give you up, not to&#xD;
insult you by taking leave of you, and by the pretended grief&#xD;
that he would then feign-that I could explain to you all that&#xD;
it would he necessary for him to say."&#xD;
.Harriet listened; but half that her father said passed unheeded&#xD;
by her. She, however, comprehended enough to know that he&#xD;

was deserted by one for whom she would have left father, mother,&#xD;
home-and merely because she was a little less rich than he had&#xD;
expected-when, for his sake, had it been necessary, she would&#xD;
have encountered poverty in its extreme distress. She withdrew&#xD;
to her own room, and wept long and hopelessly, and it was not&#xD;
until after day had risen upon the earth, that sleep came to re-&#xD;
fresh her exhausted frame.&#xD;
It was long ere she recovered from the shock ; but the family&#xD;
were too much taken up with their own troubles to pay much at-&#xD;
tention to her faded cheek and hollow eye ; or, if they did, it was&#xD;
but to wonder that she should so sorrow for one who had thus&#xD;
heartlessly forsaken her, for Mr. Witherington had given to them&#xD;
all the same reason for the absence of Thorn. She drooped like&#xD;
a neglected flower ; but time spread his healing wing over her&#xD;
heart, and she gradually recovered from the blow : her cheer-&#xD;
ful spirit, and the freshness 'of her heart were gone, and she&#xD;
looked upon life as a dreary desert, in which there was no oasis&#xD;
for her to rest.&#xD;
CHAPTER        XLVIII.&#xD;
A heart whereon to lean,&#xD;
With all these deep affections that o'erfiow&#xD;

These are denied me-dreamt of still in vain.-HMANSs.&#xD;
JARED remained but a short time at home during his present&#xD;
sojourn ; but while there he found his aunt's health visibly worse&#xD;
than he had ever known it-he found that she was troubled with'&#xD;
a short, hollow cough, with which she had never before been&#xD;
afflicted, and he feared that the same insidious disease which&#xD;
had carried off Linton had begun its ravages upon her. He&#xD;
thought, too, that her ill health might be increased, if not pro-&#xD;
duced, by the effort and anxiety which it cost her to preside&#xD;
over her present household, and he therefore used all his endeav-&#xD;
ors to persuade her to give up the charge of it, and to consent&#xD;
to be supported by her nephews for the remainder of her life.&#xD;
He knew that several of her boarders would, as usual, go in the&#xD;
spring to take a summer tour, and of course it could be but a&#xD;
slight inconvenience for her other boarders to change their resi-&#xD;
dence to some one of the other numerous houses in the city ; and&#xD;
she at last yielded to his entreaties, and determined to follow his&#xD;
advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
6'&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.           133&#xD;
During his two last terms of absence from home, Jared had&#xD;
learned to play upon the fltate, and, having a fine talent for mu-&#xD;
sic, he had acquired a proficiency in it which delighted all who&#xD;
heard him. Emma was fond of music, and still more fond of&#xD;
Jared, and she would sit for hours and listen to his playing ; and&#xD;
when thus employed, nothing could draw her from his side. The&#xD;
day before he was to leave home, he had been absent nearly all&#xD;
day arranging his business for his departure, and when he entered&#xD;
the room upon his return to his aunt's house, he found.Emma&#xD;
alone. She rose as he entered, and, walking joyfully up to him,&#xD;
she took his hand and looked inquiringly into his face. "Will&#xD;
you have your flute ?" said she.&#xD;
"I don't care for it,"-he replied.&#xD;
"But I want you to play for me."&#xD;
"If you wish to hear it, bring it to me and I will play."&#xD;
She brought it, and, taking a little chair, sat down at his feet.&#xD;
"What do you want to hear me play ?"&#xD;
"Will you play all that I tell you ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Every thing ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Suppose it should take you till ten o'clock at night ?"&#xD;
"If it does, I will play as long as you will sit up to listen."&#xD;
"Well, then, I want you to play every thing you know. I&#xD;
don't want you to leave out one single tune, but play them all,&#xD;
and all for me."&#xD;
He smiled, and took his flute, and began to play. For more&#xD;
than an hour she sat perfectly still, and looked in his face, as if&#xD;
she would inhale into her very soul every sweet sound that is-&#xD;
sued from the instrument. At length she laid her head upon&#xD;
his knee, and burst into tears.&#xD;
He stopped, surprised, for he happened at the moment to be&#xD;
playing an air that was quite lively. "What is the matter&#xD;
Emma ?" said he.&#xD;
"Nothing."&#xD;
"Then, why do you weep ?"&#xD;
I don't-know."&#xD;
"No ! but tell me, Emma ; I cannot play for you again, if it&#xD;
makes you cry."&#xD;
That does not make me cry."&#xD;
"Then tell me why you do cry."&#xD;
She remained silent a few moments ; but at length she ceased,&#xD;
and, looking up in his face-"I sat and looked at you," said she,&#xD;
"and wondered if you would always love me as you do now,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6673-00000068"/>&#xD;
131         EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPIIANS.&#xD;
and I thought what would become of me if you did not, until the&#xD;
feeling became so dreadful that I cried."&#xD;
He clasped her in his arms, and leaned her head upon his&#xD;
shoulder. For a few moments he was silent, but was evidently&#xD;
struggling with emotions which her words had excited ; for he&#xD;
had himself too often felt the want of sympathy and affection,&#xD;
not to be moved by the appeal of the child ; but when he&#xD;
spoke, his voice, though rather more sad, was calm and steady&#xD;
as usual.  "Do you think," said he, "that I could ever cease to&#xD;
love you ?"&#xD;
I don't know," said she, "but no one loves me long ; and I&#xD;
sometimes fear that you might cease to love me too."&#xD;
"When we are not loved, my dear Emma, it is often our own&#xD;
fault ; for if we act as we ought to do, we will generally find&#xD;
friends enough."&#xD;
"I don't mean friends, Jared-I have no enemies ; but I mean&#xD;
to be loved as I love."&#xD;
"And how is that ?"&#xD;
"I don't know ; I cannot tell you-but will you play more&#xD;
for me ?"&#xD;
"Yes, if you will not cry."&#xD;
"I will try not." She then rose from his embrace, kissed him,&#xD;
and resumed her seat.&#xD;
Thus, the idea of not being loved as she could love, as she did&#xD;
love, haunted her existence. Warm in her feelings, and imagi-&#xD;
native to excess, she felt truly when she thought that few would&#xD;
love as she loved.  It was, indeed, a dark thread which ran&#xD;
through the otherwise brilliant warp of her mental life.&#xD;
CHAPTER       XLIX.&#xD;
"tier cheek was fair&#xD;
As the evening star&#xD;
When it sets in the twilight gloaming;&#xD;
And her spirit was free&#xD;

When it steals from the tempest breathing."&#xD;
JARED took his departure on the day that he expected ; and&#xD;
while he is absent, we will conduct our readers to the fine cli-&#xD;
mate and lovely spot of St. Stephens. As Richard wrote, it&#xD;
was situated about a quarter of a mile from the Tombighee&#xD;
river, on an elevated hill, which rose gradually and continuously&#xD;
from the banks. The land upon which the town was situated,&#xD;
and thatrimmediately around it, was extremely rich, and heavily&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
z&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY7 OR THE ORPHANS.           135&#xD;
wooded with forests of almost every variety of trees, from the&#xD;
lofty beech and pine to the graceful flowery ash, which waved&#xD;
its slender branches and feathery bloom to the summer wind.&#xD;
Spring was busily engaged in clothing those lovely woods in their&#xD;
varied garment of green; for she had already spread its velvet&#xD;
carpet on the earth, and the air was so balmy and redolent with&#xD;
the sweets which the trees sent forth from their bursting buds,&#xD;
that one might have thought, as he inhaled its perfume, that&#xD;
death could never be borne upon its breath. There was unusual&#xD;
bustle in the streets. The ladies were out making calls-some-&#xD;
times on each other, sometimes on the different stores which&#xD;
lined the principal street; and some were out merely to enjoy the&#xD;
beauty of the day. Four barges, laden with new goods, had&#xD;
that day arrived from Mobile ; for at the time of which we&#xD;
speak, a steamboat, with its hoarse puffs, had never awakened&#xD;
the alligators, as they reposed in their muddy beds along the&#xD;
banks of the Tombigbee. In consequence of the arrival of the&#xD;
boats, every dray and cart in town was put in requisition to&#xD;
bring up the goods. The bustle was further increased, by sev-&#xD;
eral strings of Western wagons entering the town ; some with&#xD;
immigrants and their families, who were anxious to put their&#xD;
sickle to the golden harvest which was said-to stand ready for&#xD;
their reaping in all parts of Alabama, but particularly in that&#xD;
favored spot, St. Stephens. Some were laden with Western&#xD;
produce from the rich lands of 'Tennessee, whose owners had&#xD;
come with the double purpose of selling a little of their flour,&#xD;
apples, &amp;amp;c., and at the same time looking at the country, which,&#xD;
if they found superior to their own, they would return to pack&#xD;
up their " plunder," and migrate to Alabama. With one set of&#xD;
these first-named wagons was a carriage, drawn by two fine&#xD;
large horses ; a gig, containing two girls, just verging upon&#xD;
womanhood, and driven by one of them; and a little spirited boy,&#xD;
upon a pony that looked rather demurely round him, as if dis-&#xD;
daining the whip which his rider unsparingly inflicted, brought&#xD;
up the rear. As. they passed through the street, Richard and&#xD;
one of his acquaintances were standing before the door of Mr.&#xD;
Williams's store; for as he had received his spring goods the&#xD;
week before, Richard was now exempt from the crowding and&#xD;
running which occupied the time of so many of his fellow-&#xD;
clerks.&#xD;
"Look Out, Stanley," said young Randolph ; "I suspect that&#xD;
is Col. Dampier and family, who has beon expected for the last&#xD;
week. They say he is rich, and has got a host of girls ; so there&#xD;
is a fine chance for both of us."&#xD;

"How many daughters are there ?" said Richard.&#xD;
"Ah ! I don't know ; either four, or five, or six, or seven."&#xD;
"Stop, stop : I'll have no such guess-work. Do you know&#xD;
the old gentleman ?"&#xD;
"Yes, slightly."&#xD;
"Will you introduce me to-morrow ?"&#xD;
"If I go there. But I think you had better wait until they&#xD;
get a little settled before you call upon them," said Randolph,&#xD;
coldly.&#xD;
Richard saw by the manner of Randolph that he was unwilling&#xD;
to introduce him, and therefore he was resolved to say no more&#xD;
upon the subject, but to become acquainted with them by some&#xD;
other means; for he was not one to push himself upon the good&#xD;
offices of any one, or to accept them unless willingly granted.&#xD;
But just as he opened his lips to change the subject, a young&#xD;
man, by whom Randolph had been introduced to Col. Dampier,&#xD;
and who he knew was well acquainted with the family, came&#xD;
in sight. "Hollo, Comstock," said Randolph, "we want you&#xD;
here to decide a question of great importance between Richard&#xD;
Stanley and myself."&#xD;
"And what is it ?" said Comstock.&#xD;
"We want to know how many daughters Col. Dampier has."&#xD;
"Seven," said Comstock.&#xD;
"how many that are grown ?"&#xD;
"Two that are decidedly young ladies, and one whom I sup-&#xD;
pose writes herself upon that list."&#xD;
"\Well," said Richard, "the third one is just the right age for&#xD;
me, and I select her without having seen either of them. What&#xD;
i her name.,.&#xD;
"Her name," said Comstock, "is Mary, or Polly, as the fam-&#xD;
ily ll her ; but I demur to your choosing her, as I have picked&#xD;
her out for myself."&#xD;
"Never mind that. how old is she ?"&#xD;
"About the witching age of fifteen. But look here, Stanley,&#xD;
remember I warn you beforehand to choose some other ; for I&#xD;
flatter myself that I have already make a sufficient impression in&#xD;
that quarter for you to stand no chance."&#xD;
"Well," said Richard, "I will just take a note' of her name&#xD;
in my pocket-book, and whoever wins may wear I" Thus say-&#xD;
ing, he took out his pocket book, and wrote in it  Mary Dam-&#xD;
pier, aged fifteen."  "Now," said he, "as I have made the en-&#xD;
try of her name and age, and as I never do things by halves,&#xD;
you must assist me to finish the description. What is her&#xD;
height ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, Or THE ORPHANS.            137&#xD;
"Rather above medium."&#xD;
"And the color of her hair ?"&#xD;
"Quite a light brown."&#xD;
"Her eyes ?"&#xD;
"Gray."&#xD;
"Her mouth?   Now give me a good description of that, for&#xD;
it is my favorite feature. By it I judge of character, particularly&#xD;
of disposition and temper; and to me the eyes express not half&#xD;
as much as the mouth."&#xD;
"You have forgotten the nose; it is not fair for you to skip that."&#xD;
"Oh, fie upon her nose ! tell me of her mouth."&#xD;
"But her nose is a very fine one, almost a Grecian."&#xD;
" Pshaw ! tell me of her mouth."&#xD;
"She has the finest teeth that I ever saw."&#xD;
"Comstock," said Richard, laughing, "do you want to have&#xD;
a fight upon your hands? If you do not, you had better give&#xD;
an answer to my oft-repeated question."&#xD;
"Yes, Stanley, I believe I had rather fight than answer your&#xD;
questions, because, as I have told you, I have picked out Polly&#xD;
Dampier for myself."&#xD;
"Come on, then," said Richard ; and they immediately began&#xD;
to wrestle. Richard soon threw his antagonist.&#xD;
"Well," said Comstock, "as you have conquered, I will now&#xD;
answer your question. It will be impossible for you to see her&#xD;
mouth encircled by a smile without wishing intensely to kiss it.&#xD;
The graces lend it expression, and I never saw one more charac-&#xD;
teristic of all that is mild and amiable."&#xD;
"Admirable !" said Richard; "such a description is worth&#xD;
fighting for ; but, Comstock, if you ever call her Polly again in&#xD;
my presence, it shall cost you another wrestling-match ; for the&#xD;
idea of changing the sweet name of Mary into the hateful one of&#xD;
Polly is most barbarous."&#xD;
"Well," said Comstock good-humoredly, "I will reward you,&#xD;
Stanley, for your conquest of me ; for as I am esteemed the best&#xD;
wrestler in St. Stephens, I think you deserve it ; and if you will&#xD;
hold yourself in readiness to-morrow evening, I will call for you&#xD;
and introduce you to the family of Colonel Dampier, and you&#xD;
may have a chance of becoming acquainted with Miss Polly-&#xD;
oh, I beg your pardon ! with Miss Mary Dampier, yourself ; and&#xD;
if you are determined to enter the lists against me for her hand,&#xD;
be it so; though I hope our wrestling-match is not prophetic of&#xD;
the issue."&#xD;
"Youemay be sure it is ; but I thank you much for the offer,&#xD;
and shall gladly accept it."&#xD;

The echoing wheel you've marked&#xD;
In its receding flight,&#xD;
Like victor, v'aunting, as it took&#xD;
Your idol from your sight.-L. H. sIGoURNY.&#xD;
Tna morrow evening came, and about an hour after the tavern&#xD;
bells had announced the time of supper, our two friends, Richard&#xD;
and Comstock, were seen wending their way slowly up a hill,&#xD;
which was crowned by a group of oaks, and in the centre of them&#xD;
stood a small white house ; we need hardly say that this house&#xD;
was now occupied by Colonel Dampier and family. The two&#xD;
young men were arm in arm, and earnestly engaged in conversa-&#xD;
tion, which was interrupted by Comstock saying, "Here we are !&#xD;
but I must pay you the compliment of saying, that your conver-&#xD;
sation has been so interesting, that it has made the distance&#xD;
about half as long as I thought it a few days ago, when I trav-&#xD;
ersed it to take a view of the premises." He had knocked while&#xD;
he was speaking, and the last word was scarcely said, "the list-&#xD;
ener had not turned his head," when the door was opened, and&#xD;
Richard found himself rather suddenly in the presence of Colonel&#xD;
Dampier, his lady, and several of the daughters. He was intro-&#xD;
duced to them in succession, and as his glance fell upon Miss&#xD;
Mary Dampier, he mentally confirmed the preference he had be-&#xD;
fore made. The eldest daughter had nothing very interesting or&#xD;
prepossessing in her appearance. The second was a handsome&#xD;
and showy girl, one who looked as if likely to win hearts, and to&#xD;
be proud of the homage offered to her ; but Mary looked as if&#xD;
wholly unconscious that worship, such as heart renders to heart,&#xD;
would ever be hers. She was modest in her demeanor, and&#xD;
when she took part in the general conversation of the evening,&#xD;
she ventured her remarks, rather than thrust them forward as if&#xD;
sure of indulgence; but when particularly addressed, she answered&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.            139&#xD;
without hesitation or diffidence, and in well-selected and ready&#xD;
language. Richard was pleased with the whole family. The&#xD;
colonel was a good representation of an old Virginian gentleman;&#xD;
for he was originally from that State. He was easy and courte-&#xD;
ous in his manners, and behaved to the youth of both sexes more&#xD;
in the character of a father, than of one uninterested in their oc-&#xD;
cupations and pursuits. Mrs. Dampier was a fine-looking woman,&#xD;
and remarkably talkative, and her conversation was dictated by&#xD;
good sense ; and both herself and husband received the young&#xD;
men with so much cordiality, and invited them to repeat their&#xD;
visit with so much politeness, that Richard determined to be-&#xD;
come a frequent visitor at their house. Not that he was in love,&#xD;
for he was not one of those impulsive beings who fall in love at&#xD;
first sight, but he was much pleased with his reception ; for the&#xD;
society of St. Stephens was, like all new places, of no very select&#xD;
nature, and it afforded but few families sufficiently refined in their&#xD;
tastes and habits for him to hail their society with pleasure ; and&#xD;
as he had but few associates, he was glad to extend their number,&#xD;
when in so doing he could meet with that kind of society which&#xD;
was improving as well as agreeable.&#xD;
Many were the pleasure-parties which were that summer set&#xD;
on foot by the young gentlemen of the city of St. Stephens,&#xD;
and whenever Richard could leave the store, and could persuade&#xD;
Miss Mary Dampier to make one of the number of the pleasure-&#xD;
seekers, he was certain to be with her ; but unless she was one,&#xD;
he always found himself so particularly engaged that he could&#xD;
not go ; and it was not long before he found that there was in&#xD;
her presence an attraction which no one else had ever possessed-&#xD;
that he preferred her society to all others, and ere the summer&#xD;
wore away, she had gained the influence of a first love over his&#xD;
hitherto untouched heart, and he hoped that he had awaked a&#xD;
corresponding interest in hers.. He saw that her eyes would&#xD;
brighten and her cheeks would flush at his approach, and those&#xD;
hopes were heightened by the knowledge that Comstock had&#xD;
been rejected. It was true that he often met Randolph at her&#xD;
father's house, but even the jealous eyes of love could detect no&#xD;
partiality in her behavior to him. He had, however, never spoken&#xD;
to her of love ; for he felt that they were both quite young, and&#xD;
he was yet too poor. But he was with her as much as possible.&#xD;
He exposed to her his own character without reserve, and he&#xD;
endeavored to fathom and to form hers, and' then when his cir-&#xD;
cumstances would justify the act, he determined to ask for the&#xD;
exchange of heart for heart, that by their sympathy they might&#xD;
double each other's joys, and lighten each other's sorrows.&#xD;

But time passed unheeded by them, and September came and&#xD;
brought upon its wings disease, and death, and sorrow. The&#xD;
small town of St. Stephens proved an extended grave-yard. It&#xD;
was nearly decimated by the ruthless hand of Death, and more&#xD;
than half of the survivors were sick. Among the latter was&#xD;
Richard, and also several of Colonel Dampier's family. Mary,&#xD;
however, escaped ; but the general sickness, and the very great&#xD;
number of deaths, made Colonel Dampier resolve to leave the&#xD;
place the ensuing spring and to go higher up the country.&#xD;
As soon as Richard was sufficiently convalescent, he visited&#xD;
Mary, and that resolve was the first intelligence that he received.&#xD;
It came from Mary's lips, and before he left her that evening he&#xD;
had told her all his hopes and fears, and had received from her&#xD;
an acknowledgment of returned affection; and when he urged&#xD;
her to unite her fate to his, she referred him to her father.&#xD;
The next day he was for some time alone with Colonel Dam-&#xD;
pier in his law-office. When their conference was at an end&#xD;
he came out dispirited and disappointed ; for his youth and his&#xD;
poverty formed too formidable obstacles in the eyes of the old&#xD;
man, to permit him to hold out any hope to Stanley that he&#xD;
would ever succeed. While he acknowledged the prudence&#xD;
of the objections, hope buoyed up his spirit ; for he knew that&#xD;
time would remove the one, and he trusted to his own exertions&#xD;
to overcome the other.&#xD;
That day, however, he sought not an interview with Mary,&#xD;
but shortly after he told her all that passed ; but while he men-&#xD;
tioned his trust of one day presenting himself without any ob-&#xD;
jection attaching to him 'before her father, he did not attempt&#xD;
to fetter her future movements by asking her to pledge herself&#xD;
to him. He left her free to the whispers of her own heart, and&#xD;
while Colonel Dampier's family remained, though he still con-&#xD;
tinued his attentions to her as devotedly as before, yet he did not&#xD;
again resume the subject ; and when the time of their departure&#xD;
came, though he rode several miles with them on the way, he&#xD;
hade her adieu without one hint of the future.&#xD;

THE fears of Jared with regard to the disease which afflicted&#xD;
Miss Stanley were but too well founded. She had from her&#xD;

EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.           141&#xD;
youth been of an extremely delicate constitution, and under the&#xD;
exposure consequent to the exertions that she had of late years&#xD;
necessarily made, her health had gradually given way, and she&#xD;
was fast hurrying to the tomb. Jared arrived home in June,&#xD;
and when he got there he found her already too weak to sit up&#xD;
more than half of the day ; and before the month of July had&#xD;
passed, she was obliged to recline altogether. She was con-&#xD;
scious of her situation, but yet was persuaded that she would&#xD;
linger till September. "I shall not die till the fall of the leaf,"&#xD;
was her frequent exclamation; and perhaps her prophecy proved&#xD;
its own fulfilment ; for it was the third day of September that&#xD;
her friends were called upon to witness the close of a life that,&#xD;
from her early youth, when she first administered to the infirmi-&#xD;
ties of an aged mother, had always been passed in doing good&#xD;
t others, in total disregard to her own ease or enjoyment.&#xD;
A most violent storm was raging without. The rain was&#xD;
pouring down as if it would wash every thing away from its&#xD;
foundation, and what withstood the rain, the wind seemed en-&#xD;
deavoring to scatter before its mighty blasts ; and many of the&#xD;
large trees which were unharmed by the rain or wind, were&#xD;
riven by the lightning. It was a storm unparalleled in its inten-&#xD;
sity in that mild clime. But while nature was thus at strife&#xD;
without, all was peaceful and calm round the dying bed of Miss&#xD;
Stanley. She had passed her life in preparation for eternity-then&#xD;
how could she fear it?  She did not. She only wished to live&#xD;
on account of those to whom she had so long performed the part&#xD;
of a fond mother; but when she thought of them, and particu-&#xD;
larly of Emma, a few fond regrets, a few longings for life, a few&#xD;
lingering desires a little longer to remain with them, still re-&#xD;
tained their hold upon her heart. She expressed herself blessed,&#xD;
however, that Jared was present, and appeared much relieved&#xD;
that she could commit Emma to his peculiar care. Towards the&#xD;
time of retiring for the night, she requested that Emma might&#xD;
be kept out of the room, as she was too young to see her die,&#xD;
and she would not willingly have the remembrance of her ever&#xD;
mingled with the horrors that a dying bed always presented to&#xD;
the imagination of a child. Emma was accordingly sent up stairs ;&#xD;
but she could not sleep. She lay down, because it was her&#xD;
aunt's desire, but being unable to sleep she rose, went to the&#xD;
window, and sat calmly down and watched the lightning. Being&#xD;
naturally excessively afraid of thunder, this was the first storm&#xD;
that she could be said ever to have witnessed ; for it was the&#xD;
first one in which she had not hidden her face on the bosom of&#xD;
that dear being who was now about leaving her forever.&#xD;

142         EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.&#xD;
After having been up stairs some time, Jared went up to see&#xD;
if she were asleep, and found her thus engaged. "Emma," said&#xD;
he, "why are you not in bed ?"&#xD;
"Is it not beautiful ?" said she, pointing to the lightning, and&#xD;
paying no attention to his question.&#xD;
"Are you not afraid ?" said he.&#xD;
"Why should I be?  If it kills me, is she not dying ?"&#xD;
"Emma, you are wrong to say so."&#xD;
She made him no reply, but continued to gaze on the storm&#xD;
as before. There was no tear in her eye, and one to have seen&#xD;
her would have thought that she felt not the loss she was about&#xD;
to suffer ; but it was the intensity of her feeling which gave her&#xD;
courage thus to sit and gaze upon that fearful scene. Jared&#xD;
stood a moment and looked upon her, and then thinking it best&#xD;
to leave her, turned to go down. His movement startled her.&#xD;
She sprang towards him, and looked beseechingly in his face.&#xD;
"D)o let me go down! Oh! please let me go down !" said&#xD;
she.&#xD;
"Would you wish to disturb the last moments of aunt Nancy?&#xD;
She has twice to-night asked if you were here, and is anxious&#xD;
for you to stay. Are you afraid ?"&#xD;
"Afraid ! to-night--oh, no ! not afraid."&#xD;
"Then you will stay ?"&#xD;
"Yes&#xD;
The storm continued to rage until about midnight, when it&#xD;
began to subside, and it gradually grew calmer until it was per-&#xD;
fectly still, and at two o'clock there was scarcely breath enough&#xD;
to wave a leaf. At about half-past three o'clock Miss Stanley&#xD;
sank to rest ; and her last word was a blessing upon her nephew,&#xD;
as he smoothed her pillow. As soon as she had breathed her&#xD;
last, he went up stairs to communicate the tidings to his sister.&#xD;
lie found her sitting where he had left her, as though she had&#xD;
not moved. He sat down by her side, threw his arms around&#xD;
her, kissed her forehead, and leaned her head upon his shoulder,&#xD;
and thus the two orphans sat and wept in each other's arms.&#xD;
Neither of them spoke, for both felt the vanity of words--both&#xD;
felt that they had lost their best friend-both felt as if they were&#xD;
all that the'world contained for each other, and'yet, alas ! how&#xD;
soon must they be separated.&#xD;
The next day, after Miss Stanley was dressed in the habili-&#xD;
ments of the grave, she was left alone in a closed room. Emma&#xD;
being unnoticed stole into the room, and sat down by the bed on&#xD;
which lay the cold remains that were to her so dear. She there&#xD;
recalled all the maternal counsels of the deceased, and grieved&#xD;

that she had not obeyed them more. Thus was she employed&#xD;
when the tolling bell announced to the inhabitants of the city&#xD;
that one of their number had been called home by death : its&#xD;
booming sound was like an ice-bolt to the heart of Emma, for it&#xD;
seemed to repeat the desolating truth that she was indeed an or-&#xD;
phan, with no guide but Him who has promised to be a Father to&#xD;
the fatherless. At its first sound she sank upon her knees, and&#xD;
burying her face in her hands, she listened with an intensity of&#xD;
fearful agony at every stroke which proclaimed her desolation.&#xD;
She trembled at the thought that when that solemn sound again&#xD;
should smite upon her ear, it would be the signal for those dear&#xD;
remains to be borne away. Thus she remained until her brother,&#xD;
missing her, sought her there. "Emma," said he, kindly, "you&#xD;
must not stay here ;" and taking her by the hand he led her&#xD;
from the room. She spoke not, but permitted him to lead her&#xD;
away, for her grief made her passive, and took from her all will&#xD;
of her own; but though she thus suffered, she generally pre-&#xD;
served her self-composure before strangers, and one to have seen&#xD;
her would have thought that she felt but slightly the depth of&#xD;
her whose motherly care had been over her from infancy. Thus&#xD;
little do we know of each other's sufferings.&#xD;

"MY DEAR BROTHER.-&#xD;
" I hope the intelligence conveyed in my letter of a late date,&#xD;
may have prepared you for the heart-rending tidings which it is&#xD;
now my duty to communicate to you, which will need the exer-&#xD;
tion of all your fortitude to bear. Our dear aunt Nancy-our&#xD;
more than mother, is no more ! She breathed her, last this&#xD;
morning, at half-past three o'clock. For several days she had&#xD;
been failing very sensibly, and suffering much; for twenty hours&#xD;
previous to her death she was conscious of the near approach of&#xD;
dissolution, and almost the last attempt she made to speak, was&#xD;
to express her willingness to yield herself up to that God whom&#xD;
she had worshipped so faithfully, and whose commands she had&#xD;
so constantly obeyed. As the awful moment approached, her&#xD;
sufferings, with her strength, became less, and she at length sunk&#xD;
without a groan into the arms of her blessed Redeemer, passing&#xD;
away as softly and as gradually as the dew before the sun. She&#xD;
retained her consciousness to the last, and it is a great consola-&#xD;
tion that she died so easily, and that during all her illness she&#xD;
was so patient and resigned.&#xD;

hope, which, however frequent or acute their sufferings, never&#xD;
permits them to despair. Such was the case with Jared Stan&#xD;

could be unsinkingly borne by one who cheerfully submitted to&#xD;
his Maker's will; to show how far a trusting reliance upon God,&#xD;
and a true heart of hope, could lift its possessor above every ill&#xD;
to which flesh is heir ; and truly he was sorely tired ! Upon the&#xD;
death of his aunt, he felt himself the immediate protector of&#xD;
Emma, and the source from whence her wants would be supplied.&#xD;
and therefore lie went to sea with a double object for his exer-&#xD;
tions. He was bound for Antwerp, and was wrecked on his out-&#xD;
ward passage, escaping only with his life. . He returned to&#xD;
America, but the state of his purse forbade his going to see his&#xD;
sister as he desired ; and as he sailed from Charleston, South&#xD;
Carolina, two letters from thence was all that she had to assure&#xD;
her that she was still loved by him with undiminished affection.&#xD;
As one of those letters is characteristic of his hopeful disposition,&#xD;
we will give it entire.&#xD;

Letter fromu Jared Stanley to Emma.&#xD;
"CHARLESTON, Jan. 2, 18-.&#xD;
"My DEAR EMMA&#xD;
"We hauled into the stream this morning, and should have&#xD;
sailed, but the wind being variable, and rainy weather, the pilot&#xD;
did not think it a good time to go. So while we are laying here&#xD;
at anchor, I will once more scribble you a line or two, if it be&#xD;
only to tell you that I have nothing to say.&#xD;
"As this may be the first letter you receive this year, and&#xD;
being the first that I have written, it may not be amiss to wish&#xD;
you a happy new year, which I am sure I do with all my heart.&#xD;
We are now bound to Malaga, and from thence to Cuba, and per-&#xD;
haps we may go from Cuba to Cadiz before we return to the&#xD;
United States : thus my wandering profession drives me like a&#xD;
vagrant all over this wide world, and my last voyage, owing to&#xD;
my losing every thing by the wreck, was to me a truly disastrous&#xD;
one ; but hope was early instilled into my heart, and I never&#xD;
give it up under the most adverse circumstances. I often think&#xD;
of the proverb, that 'the finest days do in the morning lower;'&#xD;
and perhaps the distresses we now endure may be designed to&#xD;
teach us pity for the woes of others, and to make us grateful for&#xD;
the benefits that we are yet to receive. When smarting under&#xD;
the stroke of misfortune, I console myself by considering that I&#xD;
may have pleasure in reversion ; and while I look forward with&#xD;
hope myself, I would point the bright vision out to you, though&#xD;
the vista through which we behold the glorious sight may be&#xD;
most gloomy.&#xD;
"I am glad to hear from you, that you are still pleased with&#xD;
your situation, and to see by Mrs. Campbell's postscript, that&#xD;
your teachers are pleased with you. Remember the comforts&#xD;
you will enjoy, or the unhappiness you will endure, will depend&#xD;
in a great measure upon your own conduct. You have a great&#xD;
share of resolution, and I believe your integrity has never been&#xD;
impeached. Continue to preserve it inviolate, and let your for-&#xD;
titude always be exerted in a good cause. Write to tie with&#xD;
confidence. Tell me all your hopes and fears. I shall always&#xD;
write to you with the most perfect freedom, and I trust that you&#xD;
will, through your life, ever practise the candor and ingenuous-&#xD;
ness which has hitherto characterized you; and I shall continue&#xD;
to look forward with pleasing anticipation to the time when I&#xD;
shall embrace you, improved in mind and person.&#xD;

"Though the wings of thy spirit be broken and crushed,&#xD;
And the voice that thou luved'st in eternity hushed ;&#xD;
Though death blight thy prospect of all that was fair,&#xD;
vet thine is a promise-then 'never despair !'"&#xD;
THE quiver of adversity was not yet empty ; it still contained&#xD;
some arrows for our noble-hearted hero. Jared performed his voy-&#xD;
age prosperously until he neared the American coast, when they&#xD;
were overtaken at night by a severe storm, which drove them on&#xD;
the headland of Cape Fear, and again he was wrecked. The&#xD;
crew were nearly all saved, but some of them were not even as&#xD;
fortunate as that. Again was Jared destitute and penniless,&#xD;
just before the joyful anticipation of seeing his sister could be&#xD;
realized.&#xD;
It was in the last of June that he arrived in Charleston, and&#xD;
to add to his distresses, a few days after he got there he was&#xD;
taken with the yellow fever. A hospital was his only resource.&#xD;
He, the wealthy born, the finely educated, the talented, the&#xD;
noble and the good, was consigned to a ward of one of those&#xD;
receptacles of the wretched: here he remained until he was able&#xD;
to walk about the streets. He then endeavored to get into some&#xD;
employ, but no captain would receive a mate who had just risen&#xD;
from a sick bed.&#xD;
During all his 'sickness his thoughts had constantly turned to&#xD;
his sister, and one day while wandering in the streets, endeavor..&#xD;
ing to meet with some one who would want a mate, and be will-&#xD;
ing to employ him, he came across a Captain Lewis, over whom,&#xD;
as a cabin-boy, he had once held control, and in gratitude for&#xD;
Jared's former kindness to him, he gave him passage to New-&#xD;
port, whither he was bound ; and he was soon receiving from&#xD;
Emma tears of sympathy, which were all she had to give: But&#xD;
it was enough to soothe his wounded spirit. He remained with&#xD;

be able to get into employment, and not finding any there, he&#xD;
determined to go to New York to seek it. He took leave of&#xD;
Emma, who smiled as she gave him a parting kiss ; but after he&#xD;
had gone a few steps he thought of some last words that he was&#xD;
desirous to say to her, and he returned to her room. He found&#xD;
her weeping convulsively. "Why do you weep ?" said he, affec-&#xD;
tionately embracing her.&#xD;
"For you," she replied.&#xD;
"Oh, do not weep for me," said he; "I shall shortly return&#xD;
to see you; better off, too, I hope, than I am now."&#xD;
"No, Jared, you are going, and you are not able to go. You&#xD;
cannot deceive me. I know you are not well enough to encoun-&#xD;
ter the hardships of your profession. Oh ! if I could only go&#xD;
with you, to nurse you if you were sick, I should then be&#xD;
satisfied."&#xD;
"And would you go, my dear sister, if you could ?"&#xD;
"Would I ! Oh yes, with joy."&#xD;
"Well, then, will you solemnly make me one promise, that&#xD;
from the day you are seventeen years old, should we both live&#xD;
to see that time, always to accompany me in all my voyages ?"&#xD;
"Yes, solemnly will I promise, and gladly will I perform."&#xD;
"I am in hopes to be the captain of a ship before that time."&#xD;
"Whether you are captain or mate, will you let me go.?"&#xD;
"Yes ; and. your being with me will add greatly to my hap-&#xD;
piness ; but we must not talk of this now, for I must leave you."&#xD;
He said all he could to cheer her, and after she had become&#xD;
composed, he kissed her again, strained her once more to his&#xD;
breast, and left her to mourn his absence.&#xD;
After some difficulty he succeeded in getting a situation as&#xD;
mate of a packet, which plied between New York and Charles-&#xD;
ton. But he had overrated his strength. The service which&#xD;
his situation required, and which he diligently labored to perform,&#xD;
exhausted recovering nature ; and in his second voyage to&#xD;
Charleston, as he was one day giving orders to the men, he fell&#xD;
down in a fit. The next day the vessel arrived in port, and he&#xD;
was carried on shore, and again committed to the hospital, and&#xD;
on the third he died, pronouncing blessings on his sister. Death&#xD;
sealed his utterance with her name upon his lips!&#xD;
The news was conveyed to Emma by an old sailor who had&#xD;
been appointed her brother's nurse, and the tears ran down his&#xD;
weather-beaten face as he told the direful tale.&#xD;
And how was Emma affected by it? It was a shock from&#xD;
which she never entirely recovered.. To her Jared had united&#xD;

the characters of father, brother, guardian, friend. It was to&#xD;
him that she had told all her joys. It was into his ear that she&#xD;
had poured all her sorrows. And thus to lose him !-to know&#xD;
that there was no loved one near him to catch his last words-&#xD;
to hear his last request ; that his couch was tended only by one&#xD;
of the sailors of the ship, who, however attached he might be,&#xD;
could but illy supply the place of a sister who loved him. Such&#xD;
harrowing thoughts added three-fold agony to the acuteness of&#xD;
separation.  For many months her buoyancy of spirit entirely&#xD;
deserted her, for she had a load of anguish at her heart.  Grief&#xD;
dulled the lustre of her eyes, and a smile could scarcely be called&#xD;
upon her lips.  She would sit for hours and gaze upon vacancy,&#xD;
while her thoughts were hovering round the nameless grave of&#xD;
him for whom, had it been possible to recall him to life, she&#xD;
would have cheerfully yielded up her crushed and wounded&#xD;
soul. This blow, so sudden, so severe, had an effect to change&#xD;
her character in some degree for life. Hitherto she had been&#xD;
wild as the young fawn of the desert, with no thought for the&#xD;
future but such as was whispered by hope. Henceforth she&#xD;
learned to fear the future, and to gild it with no bright anticipa-&#xD;
tions ; and it was seldom that she ever after had those bursts of&#xD;
careless joy which before had always characterized her. In short,&#xD;
it awaked her to the full perception of the sad realities of an or-&#xD;
phan's life. Now she was indeed alone. Her brother Richard&#xD;
was in Alabama, and she, with no relative upon whom she could&#xD;
rest all her burden of affections, and with no guide but the re-&#xD;
membrance of the counsels of those who were gone.&#xD;
CHAPTER        LIV.&#xD;
The gloomiest soul is not all gloom;&#xD;
The saddest heart is not all sadness;&#xD;
And sweetly o'er the darkest doom&#xD;
'There shines some lingering beam of gladness.-HEMANs.&#xD;
BUr in this hour of desolation Emma was not left alone and&#xD;
forgotten. He to whose care she had been so often and so sol-&#xD;
emnly committed-the Strength of those who have no helper-&#xD;
raised her up another friend in her hour of need. Let the or-&#xD;
phan place her trust upon His arm who is mighty to save, and&#xD;
it will never be placed there in vain. Richard came to her aid&#xD;
when she needed his services. At the time that he heard of his&#xD;
brother Jared's death, he was just recovering from a long and&#xD;
severe fit of illness, the expenses of which left him considerably&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.           149&#xD;
in debt, but he hesitated not to come to the aid of her who was&#xD;
yet more destitute than himself. With a generosity truly noble,&#xD;
he was willing to deny himself yet longer the hope of being uni-&#xD;
ted to her who was the loadstone of his affections; for he was&#xD;
well aware that to burden himself with the support of another,&#xD;
would be narrowing his own means of living, and consequently it&#xD;
would be deferring his union with Miss Dampier ; but when his&#xD;
friends required his assistance he thought not of himself. He&#xD;
accordingly wrote to her, urging her to come to Alabama ; send-&#xD;
ing her a hundred dollars, and offering to find her a protector on&#xD;
the journey.&#xD;
She would gladly have accepted this first invitation, but the&#xD;
lady under whose charge she was placed, refused to allow her&#xD;
to do so unless with the consent of Mr. Witherington ; and he,&#xD;
with the true spirit that had always characterized him, refused&#xD;
it, for no other reason but because she was so anxious to go.&#xD;
She was, therefore, obliged to decline ; for what could a girl of&#xD;
thirteen years of age do against the will of those who pretended&#xD;
to control her? She therefore continued at school, and, as far&#xD;
as the gloom which the death of her brother had cast over her&#xD;
spirit permitted, she pursued her studies ; but she wrote to&#xD;
Richard how much she desired to be with him, who was now the&#xD;
only being whom death had spared for her to love.&#xD;
That summer had deprived Richard of his friend, Mr. Wil-&#xD;
liams, under whose protection he went to Alabama, and the&#xD;
other partner of the house, knowing Richard's business habits&#xD;
and his integrity, and being aware how valuable a member this&#xD;
would make him of-the firm, made him an offer of Mr. Williams's&#xD;
place, and when the following autumn came, it found him in&#xD;
much superior circumstances to what he had been the year be-&#xD;
fore. Again he wrote to Emma, making her the same offer that&#xD;
he had done the year before, and again Mr. Witherington op-&#xD;
posed her going ; but gifted with a spirit of independence superior&#xD;
to most of her sex, and a firmness of purpose that nothing could&#xD;
shake, she boldly told her uncle that she had once submitted to&#xD;
his opposition, but that henceforth it would be vain ; that her&#xD;
brother Richard was the only one upon *hose kindness she had&#xD;
a claim, and that she should write to him, that he might appoint&#xD;
her escort on the way; for she would go to him; that if he&#xD;
gave his consent it was well; but if not, she would go without&#xD;
it, and if he attempted to stop her, she would elude his vigi-&#xD;
lance; but go she would.&#xD;
He felt that it would be worse than useless for him to inter-&#xD;
pose his authority, and he then took another course, and endeav-&#xD;

150         EMMA STANLEY, OR TILE ORPHANS.&#xD;
ored to dissuade her from going, by representing in the most&#xD;
frightful colors all the inconveniences to which she would be&#xD;
exposed. He also tried to excite her fears, by assuming the&#xD;
kindness of a friend, and depicting the dangers of the climate ;&#xD;
but he might as well have talked to the wind, as far as the effect&#xD;
of his eloquence was concerned, for she had too just an appre-&#xD;
ciation of his character to let it move her resolves. She acted&#xD;
as she had said she would. She wrote to her brother Richard,&#xD;
telling him that she would joyfully accept his offer, and she be-&#xD;
gan to make immediate preparations for her departure, and in the&#xD;
month of September she received, with joy, the protector to&#xD;
whom her brother consigned her.&#xD;

HER last visit ere she left her native city was to Mrs. Chap-&#xD;
man, to whom she was sincerely attached, and whom she much&#xD;
regretted to leave. It was early in the afternoon when she went&#xD;
to see her, and night was drawing her sombre curtain over the&#xD;
earth when she rose to depart.&#xD;
"My dear Emma," said Mrs. Chapman, "you are about leav-&#xD;
ing me for the home of a brother, to whom you are attached not&#xD;
only by the ordinary ties of kindred, or by his present kindness,&#xD;
but also by the remembrance of the many virtues which adorned&#xD;
his character in boyhood, and which his letters give assurance&#xD;
are interwoven in the wreath which affection sees placed upon&#xD;
his manly brow. I feel confident, my dear child, that he will&#xD;
not fail to give you that guidance which your youth must neces-&#xD;
sarily need ; but yet I cannot part with you, knowing that it is&#xD;
in all probability forever, without mingling some words of advice&#xD;
with my parting blessing ; for I have alwayswished to see you&#xD;
one of the most perfect of female characters. You have received,&#xD;
in the example and precept of your beloved aunt, those incen-&#xD;
tives to remember your Creator in the days of your youth, which&#xD;
even my parting advice can hardly strengthen ; but should you&#xD;
ever depart from his law, I hope, as your thoughts fondly, turn&#xD;

to the home of your childhood, it will, like the Israelites turn-&#xD;
ing towards their temple, bring back your thoughts to him. A&#xD;
mind like yours will require constant watchfulness and culture.&#xD;
It cannot lie idle, but must be continually engaged in good or&#xD;
evil. Let it be your every-day care to cure every defect, and to&#xD;
improve every virtue, and I wish you to notify me of every tri-&#xD;
umph which you gain over that worst enemy of us all-self. I&#xD;
trust that you will never have a deviation from the path of right&#xD;
to record.&#xD;
"I hope, my dear child, that in all the employments and&#xD;
new scenes which will unavoidably occupy your mind in your&#xD;
new home, you will often remember me. I would chain my&#xD;
mind to yours by such every-day associations that you cannot&#xD;
avoid often thinking of me. I would have you think of me&#xD;
among the flowers, with which I hear the woods of that delight-&#xD;
ful clime are richly dressed ; and let the beauteous display of&#xD;
their varied forms, colors, and properties, exalt your mind to Him&#xD;
who clothes the lilies and listens to the raven's cry ! Think of&#xD;
me in your twilight walks, and recall the many questions pro-&#xD;
posed, and meant to convey lessons of instruction adapted to&#xD;
your tender years, at that calm, peaceful hour ! Think of me,&#xD;
when you are diligently plying the knitting or sewing needles,&#xD;
and remember the striving, hiding in corners and concealments in&#xD;
various places, that you might surprise your aged competitor&#xD;
with your wonderful achievements ! Think of me as I often sat&#xD;
by the side of your respected and worthy aunt, while you were&#xD;
listening to the maternal counsels conveyed in the dulcet sound&#xD;
of her pleasant voice, and doubtless treasured -in your memory,&#xD;
and tending more than any other code of morals to the formation&#xD;
of your character ; and while these reminiscences of former times&#xD;
cross your mind, with many others 'which I omit mentioning, and&#xD;
to your vivid imagination represent things long gone by as pres-&#xD;
ent realities, remember the blessing which in God's name I now&#xD;
bestow upon you, and forget not, my dear Emma, to pray with fer-&#xD;
vency to Him who alone can give it effect." She paused for an in-&#xD;
stant, and then raised her hands above the head of the young girl&#xD;
who stood before her. "May God's blessing mingle with and give&#xD;
effect to mine !" said she. "May it rest upon you, and may its&#xD;
sanctifying influence be with you through this vale of tears, and&#xD;
prepare you for a better country ! May you enjoy all good&#xD;
here, and.may we meet in heaven; for my great age precludes&#xD;
the hope that we shall ever again see each other here !" She&#xD;
folded her arms around her as she ceased, and it was affecting&#xD;
to see that aged saint-like mortal, mingling her tears with those&#xD;

of the child. Again and again she pressed Emma to her heart ;&#xD;
again and again she kissed her, and for some time seemed una-&#xD;
ble to summon fortitude to bid her adieu. "You must leave&#xD;
me, my child," said she, "and forever, and thus lengthening our&#xD;
separation only adds force to its agony. May God bless you!-&#xD;
Adieu !" Once more she pressed her to her heart, unclasped&#xD;
her arms, turned and left the room. Emma sat down for a few&#xD;
moments, and after a struggle with her feelings, regained her&#xD;
composure sufficiently to return to that home which she had&#xD;
inhabited since her aunt's decease, and to which she was soon&#xD;
to bid adieu forever.&#xD;

EMMA arrived safely in Alabama, and she remained in Mobile&#xD;
until her brother went down to bring her to his house. When&#xD;
he came in she did not know him, for it was six years from the&#xD;
time that he had left Newport ; but as soon as he pronounced her&#xD;
name she remembered him, for as he spoke he smiled, and there&#xD;
are but few persons whose smile is easily forgotten. They ascended&#xD;
the Tombigbee River in one of the first steamboats that had&#xD;
ever navigated that stream, and they were four days performing&#xD;
the journey. When she arrived at St. Stephens she wrote to&#xD;
Mrs. Chapman accounts of every thing she saw, drawn with the&#xD;
glowing pencil that youth only uses, and so brilliantly colored&#xD;
with joy, that they told to the anxious heart of her friend that&#xD;
the new scenes into which she was ushered had given fresh vigor&#xD;
to her spirits, and for a while, at least, had renewed her buoyancy&#xD;
of spirit. The society of her brother, to whom she was devotedly&#xD;
attached, was enough of itself to render her happy for a time ;&#xD;
but besides that, every thing possessed the charm of novelty, and&#xD;
what youthful heart is dead to that charm!&#xD;
After she had been in St. Stephens about a month, Richard&#xD;
described to her the character of Miss Mary Dampier, and told&#xD;
her that he had serious thoughts of presenting her to her as her&#xD;
sister-in-law, and she was delighted to hear the news; for she had&#xD;
none of that mean jealousy in her disposition, which would lead&#xD;
her to think lightly of one who was only a relative by marriage:&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
153&#xD;
&#xD;
on the contrary, she had full faith in her brother, and she was&#xD;
confident that any one whom he would choose for a wife must be&#xD;
worthy of all her love. During the first summer of her residence&#xD;
in Alabama, she received the following, among many other letters,&#xD;
from Mrs. Chapman:&#xD;
Letter from Mrs. Chapman to Emma.&#xD;
"NEwroRT, Oct. 30, 18-.&#xD;
"My DEAR EMMA:-&#xD;
"November, the month appointed by Mr. Swinton and family&#xD;
for taking leave of Newport and embarking on their Alabama&#xD;
expedition, is just at hand ; I would not be unprepared for a greet-&#xD;
ing of my Alabama children (yourself and brother) in their com-&#xD;
pany. It was my intention- to have taken a larger paper, and&#xD;
filled it to overflowing-with what? truly with what many would&#xD;
consider the garrulous scribblings of impotent dotage.&#xD;
"You may ask my reason for contemplating such lengthy&#xD;
dispatches, and your habits of mind being rather argumentative,&#xD;
I will tell you. In the first place, leaving every thing coming&#xD;
under the head of intelligence to the oral communication of Mrs.&#xD;
Swinton, whom you knew as Miss E. Beekam, I thoughtof much&#xD;
to say to you in the character of an ancient friend. How are&#xD;
you stocked with patience, dear Emma? for in asking you this&#xD;
question, I presume that you have not been unmindful of study-&#xD;
ing your own character. Abundance of leisure, and ample means&#xD;
of forming correct views of your interior self, have doubtless led&#xD;
to a just estimate of the different ingredients that compose at&#xD;
least one human mind and heart. Have your searchings of heart&#xD;
brought to light hidden imperfections-some requiring to be&#xD;
pruned as valuable though redundant, others to be wholly'ex-&#xD;
tirpated as worthless or injurious?&#xD;
"You may, and not unlikely will, smile at my letter assuming&#xD;
so much the form of a lecture. I have neither the desire nor the&#xD;
talent for sermonizing ; but you are often in my thoughts as the&#xD;
little, feeble pet of your beloved aunt, whose memory I shall&#xD;
ever venerate, and knowing it her supreme desire that the chil-&#xD;
dren she reared with tender affection should become real Chris-&#xD;
tians, I am impelled by my own wishes to 'that consideration,&#xD;
and my advanced age forcibly reminding that every letter may&#xD;
be my last, to enforce upon you, my dear Emma, the necessity,&#xD;
in order to insure your happiness, of your choosing that good&#xD;
part that can never be taken away from yoti.&#xD;
"It may be thought selfish or unkind to rejoice in the regrets&#xD;
of those we love. Much as I wish you spared from all painful&#xD;

remembrances, I certainly felt a pleasure in your expression of a&#xD;
wish to revisit the scenes of your childhood, the friends by whom&#xD;
you are fondly remembered, and especially the temple where you&#xD;
were first taught to bow the knee in humble praise and adoration&#xD;
to the 'Father of mercies,' among his worshipping people. It&#xD;
is greatly to be lamented that no church is established in St.&#xD;
Stephens; but happy for us-that our God is not confined to&#xD;
temples made with hands : everywhere present, his parental care&#xD;
is over all his works, and his ear equally open to the cries of&#xD;
his sincere disciples, when ascending meekly from the cottage,&#xD;
the hill, or the vale, in confession, supplication, and praise, as&#xD;
from the loftiest edifice, decked with its imposing splendors, that&#xD;
was ever reared by mortal man. While you possess your Bible&#xD;
and opportunities for retirement, you may not unfrequently hold&#xD;
sweet communion with the 'Father of spirits.'&#xD;
"Write to me frequently, my dear child, and give me every&#xD;
little item of intelligence respecting yourself and household, no&#xD;
article of which will be void of interest, and none unwelcome to,&#xD;
"Yours truly and tenderly,&#xD;

ONE misfortune after another assailed Mr. Witherington. The&#xD;
policy of insurance for an extensive range of buildings, containing&#xD;
stores, warehouses, and dwelling-houses, had expired, and he had&#xD;
of late been so immersed in business, endeavoring to repair several&#xD;
heavy losses that he had sustained, that, contrary to his usual&#xD;
custom of renewing it on the day previous to its expiration, he&#xD;
had that once delayed it, though he had determined not to put&#xD;
it off beyond the next day ; but when the next day came, the&#xD;
resolve was vain. An extensive fire, which, frora the violence of&#xD;
the wind, defied the efforts of the firemen, broke out in a house&#xD;
adjoining the range belonging to him. It swept every thing be-&#xD;
fore it, and as his own otlice was on fire before he could reach&#xD;
the spot, many of his most valuable papers were destroyed, and&#xD;
he was irretrievably ruined. The distress consequent upon that&#xD;
knowledge so preyed upon his mind as to produce a fever, of&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.           155&#xD;
which he died in a few weeks ; but he died as he had lived, a.&#xD;
votary of the world; and his last breath was expended in lament-&#xD;
ing his fate, and cursing the misfortunes that produced it. A few&#xD;
days, however, before his death, he called Harriet to his bedside,&#xD;
and related to her truly every circumstance concerning his&#xD;
last interview with Mr. Thorn. "I have observed," added he,&#xD;
"your pallid cheek, and the little interest with which you looked&#xD;
on life ; but while I live I would not that he should know that&#xD;
I ever regretted. the act which deprived me of a son-in-law whom&#xD;
I have always honored in my thoughts, even against my will;&#xD;
but I hope that after I am gone, you will be his wife, for then&#xD;
he will be unable to reproach me even with a look ; -and it is my&#xD;
last command to you, if I should die-and poor as I now am I&#xD;
don't care to live-if I should die, Harriet, remember that I com-&#xD;
mand you to write to him that I amno more. Tell him that I&#xD;
deceived you with regard to his motives for deserting you, and&#xD;
that in my last sickness I told you all the truth, and desired that&#xD;
he might yet be united to you."&#xD;
"Oh, my father !" said Harriet, "I cannot so expose you ;&#xD;
neither can I become a suitor for his love."&#xD;
"Obey me !" said he, preserving his sternness and his love of&#xD;
power to the last ; "you cannot, you dare not, refuse to do as I&#xD;
bid you. Did you not at my bidding send back his letter un-&#xD;
opened, and because you now apologize, do you call it stooping?&#xD;
No ! and unless you wish to have my curse rest upon your head,&#xD;
you will obey me. And as to exposing me, think you that I&#xD;
care for aught the world can say of me when I am out of it?&#xD;
No, I care not."&#xD;
But Harriet needed not to obey his last command ; for Mr.&#xD;
Thorn happened to be in Newport on the day of her father's&#xD;
death, and he not only attended the funeral, but the next day&#xD;
wrote to her a note, asking her if a visit from one who yet loved&#xD;
her would be unpleasant. She sent him permission to come,&#xD;
and before the day had ended, every misunderstanding was ex-&#xD;
plained, every offence forgiven, and they had anew plighted to&#xD;
each other their mutual love.&#xD;
Mr. Thorn was urgent for Harriet to complete his happiness&#xD;
by giving him her hand as soon as possible ; he appeared to fear&#xD;
that something else might intervene to separate them; and as&#xD;
soon as she could consent to leave her widowed mother, who re-&#xD;
fused to desert her own home for that of another, she promised&#xD;
to give him her hand; and about three months after her father's&#xD;
death, she fixed the day of their marriage on the next Thursday.&#xD;
Harriet looked forward to the period with happy anticipation;&#xD;

not so Lucy-the gloom   of envy and disappointment settled on&#xD;
her face when she reflected that her sister, whom she had ever re-&#xD;
garded as inferior to herself, and had looked upon with contempt,&#xD;
because she was less highly gifted by nature than herself, was&#xD;
about being married to a man to whom even her envy could find&#xD;
no objection ; and still was that bitterness increased by the&#xD;
knowledge that their union would be one of fervent reciprocal&#xD;
love, that neither time, absence, nor misrepresentation, could de-&#xD;
stroy: and then, to dwell upon the contrast of her own fate-&#xD;
for she, with all the advantages that she fancied she possessed&#xD;
over her sister, had failed to touch the heart of him who had&#xD;
gained her own-and though for several years she had been fol-&#xD;
lowed, praised, and flattered ; though she had been called the&#xD;
belle of the city, and had reigned supreme as the queen of fash-&#xD;
ion ; had had her society courted by the aristocratic, the wealthy,&#xD;
and the proud,-yet she had failed to gain the love of any one&#xD;
being whom she could respect, esteem, and love in return !&#xD;

NOT far from the city, just where the ocean beats against the&#xD;
rocky barrier which on that side says to it, "Here shall thy proud&#xD;
waves be stayed !" at that place is a remarkable cavity, a round&#xD;
hole in the rock, about eight feet in diameter, which is soundless&#xD;
as far as experience has proved-for many have attempted to&#xD;
fathom  it, but so far without success.  Upon a stone being&#xD;
thrown into it, it bounds from side to side, until the sound dies&#xD;
away in the distance, and is heard no more. This place is called&#xD;
"Purgatory," from   the following circumstance: A few years&#xD;
after the first settlement of Newport, there came two Catholic&#xD;
priests to the village for the purpose of making converts to their&#xD;
faith. At first they were very cautious and prudent in the prop-&#xD;
agation of their doctrine ; but as they found several to listen at-&#xD;
tentively to what they advanced, and were treated with respect&#xD;
by most of the tolerant disciples of Roger Williams, they became&#xD;
bolder in advancing the peculiar tenets of their faith. Finally,&#xD;
they went to the dwelling of a fisherman, who had built his but&#xD;
&#xD;
EM MA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.          157&#xD;
just below the ledge of rock which formed one side of this cav-&#xD;
ity of which we have been speaking, in order to have its shelter&#xD;
from the blasts. The fisherman was of violent temper ; and it&#xD;
was whispered about that the cause of his coming to America&#xD;
was his having been guilty of parricide in England during a fit&#xD;
of passion. However that may be, he was so hasty that few&#xD;
cared to cross his humor. One day, as this man was spreading&#xD;
his nets to dry, he was accosted by one of these zealous enthu-&#xD;
siasts, who began to'talk to him concerning the peculiar doctrines&#xD;
of his faith. At first old Simon listened to him without evincing&#xD;
any other sign of anger than a contraction of the brow, for he&#xD;
thought that the Roman Catholics were the favorite emissaries of&#xD;
Satan, yet there was something so persuasive and gentle in the&#xD;
old priest, that for a while it had its effect even on his savage&#xD;
nature ; but when become emboldened by his forbearance, the&#xD;
priest began to urge upon him the pangs of purgatory, old Si-&#xD;
mon's nature could bear no more. The wrath, which had be-&#xD;
come so much the greater from its unaccustomed restraint, burst&#xD;
forth with unusual violence-he foamed at the mouth, he gnashed&#xD;
his teeth, and at last, springing upon the priest like a tiger upon&#xD;
his prey, he caught him in his arms, and, dashing him down the&#xD;
cavity which was gaping so temptingly before him, told him&#xD;
now, if it were possible, to pray himself out of purgatory ! The&#xD;
other priest was witness to the startling deed ; but he knew&#xD;
that the prejudice against his sect was too violent, and old Si-&#xD;
mon itoo much feared, for him to hope for redress, and fearing&#xD;
for his own life also, he wisely left the place. And it is to its&#xD;
being the scene of this tragedy, that it owes the name of Purga-&#xD;
tory, which it has ever since retained.&#xD;
At the time of which we speak, it was a fashionable promenade&#xD;
for the young of both sexes. Every vestige of old Simon's but&#xD;
had disappeared, and since the event from which it took its&#xD;
name, many had been the tale of love which had been breathed&#xD;
over that soundless chasm. The view was one of the finest on&#xD;
the whole island. The glassy surface of the bay stretched far&#xD;
beyond the extent of vision. The distant view of several small&#xD;
islands, which seemed to lie upon the water as if they had gone&#xD;
to sleep upon its bosom at the setting of the sun, and the dis-&#xD;
tant hum of the busy city which reached the ear in. such low&#xD;
murmurs as only to increase the quietness of the scene, altogether&#xD;
made it a place much frequented by the happy whose spirits&#xD;
sought repose; or the wretched, who, in the peaceful communion&#xD;
of nature which this place afforded them, had their sorrows&#xD;
stilled, if not forgotten.&#xD;

EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
This was a favorite walk with Lucy Witherington ; and on&#xD;
the Sunday evening previous to the Thursday fixed for Harriet's&#xD;
wedding, she sought with young Coleman this rocky shore.&#xD;
They had walked on some time in silence ; but it was broken by&#xD;
his urging her to fix a day for the fulfilment of a promise which&#xD;
she had made him long before.&#xD;
"I have long doubted the reality of such love as men vaunt&#xD;
of possessing too much to be willing to give it the test which&#xD;
it will be obliged to bear, if I set a definite day for our long-&#xD;
deferred union."&#xD;
"Is it possible, Lucy, that after my long-tried constancy of&#xD;
affection, you can doubt me?  Put my love of you to any trial,&#xD;
and see if I shrink from it! I would go through the fire to serve&#xD;
you, if I could be rewarded for so doing by the possession of&#xD;
your hand."&#xD;
She smiled with incredulity and scorn upon him as he spoke,&#xD;
for in her heart she despised him; and, as she once confessed to&#xD;
her sister, she only waited for a more eligible offer to cast his&#xD;
love back unreturned into his bosom.&#xD;
"You smile," said he, observing her beautiful mouth curling&#xD;
with contempt : "if you still doubt me, why not ask some&#xD;
proof ?"&#xD;
"And if I ask it, will you give it ?"&#xD;
"Try mc !"&#xD;
As he spoke they had just arrived at the brink of the cavity&#xD;
above described. "Jump across this chasm," said she.&#xD;
"And if I do, and alight safe on the other side, will you give&#xD;
me your hand next Thursday ?"&#xD;
"Yes," she replied, and again her lip curled with withering&#xD;
scorn. She did not think that he would dare attempt it, fnd if&#xD;
he did, she hoped that he might fail.&#xD;
But that smile that he again noticed nerved him with courage&#xD;
to make the attempt ; but it also created towards herself, in his&#xD;
bosom, a feeling nearer akin to hatred than to love, to think that&#xD;
she could thus needlessly and heartlessly peril the life of one&#xD;
whom for four years she had professed to love, and to whom&#xD;
she had then plighted her hand, and pretending to give her&#xD;
heart had never cancelled that engagement. "Then swear it !"&#xD;
said he, in a tone that startled her, as he rather roughly seized&#xD;
her arm. "Swear it, in the sight of yon heaven, earth, and sea,&#xD;
that next Thursday you will become my wife."&#xD;
Hitherto she had found him the servile tool of her wishes, and&#xD;
she was frightened by his sudden violence, to yield to his de-&#xD;
mand.&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.            159&#xD;
"I swear it," said she faintly.&#xD;
"Nay !" said he, "not such an oath as that ; but repeat my&#xD;
words : I swear by the heaven above me, by the hell below,&#xD;
and earth around, that next Thursday we will become man and&#xD;
wife, and as I fulfil my oath, so help me God ! Amen. While&#xD;
he spoke he had still maintained his hold upon her arm, and had&#xD;
glared upon her as if unless she complied his vengeance would&#xD;
be sudden and severe. The silence of the scene, and his stern&#xD;
manner, made her fear that if she disobeyed he might repeat&#xD;
towards her the act of old Simon to the priest ; and she slowly&#xD;
pronounced after him the oath he dictated. He then looked&#xD;
carefully round and prepared to spring; but as he jumped the&#xD;
terrible truth flashed across her mind, that if he were killed, she&#xD;
would be his murderess, and she reached out her hand to catch&#xD;
him; but he sprang before she could touch him, and safely&#xD;
reached the other side of the cavity, and then turned round to&#xD;
look upon his victim.&#xD;
She was standing with her arms outstretched, just as she had&#xD;
bent forward to catch him, and pale as death, and the horror&#xD;
depicted in her countenance somewhat softened his feelings to-&#xD;
wards her.&#xD;
He walked slowly round to the spot where she stood, and&#xD;
took her hand. "I am safe !" said he, "and now remember&#xD;
your oath !"&#xD;
His voice restored her to immediate self-possession. "Let us&#xD;
go home; let us leave this hated place."&#xD;
"Say, rather," he replied, "this blessed place, which has at&#xD;
last put an end to my suspense."&#xD;
She replied not; but turning from the spot they walked slowly&#xD;
and silently homeward.&#xD;
CHAPTER LIX.&#xD;
"Her timid thoughts win almost ask,&#xD;
If this be happiness?&#xD;
The bursting of the heart she feels&#xD;
Beneath her last caress."&#xD;
THE eventful Thursday at length arrived, and the double mar-&#xD;
riage of Mr. Thorn with Harriet, and Mr. Coleman with Lucy,&#xD;
was to be celebrated. The marriage ceremony was to be per-&#xD;
formed in church, and the two happy Couple were immediately&#xD;
to start away ; Mr. Thorn and his lady to New Haven, and Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Coleman and his lady on a visit to his father, who lived in the&#xD;
southern part of Vermont, among the mountains. The word&#xD;
happy might well be applied to Mr. Thorn and Harriet, who&#xD;
were united from motives of sincere and mutual affection ; but&#xD;
ah ! hew illy was it applied to the others ; for Lucy regarded Mr.&#xD;
Coleman with a mingled feeling of hatred, disgust, and fear ; and&#xD;
though he had as much affection for her as his nature was capa-&#xD;
blt of feeling, yet there were, perhaps, never two more unlike in&#xD;
all their sentiments, feelings, and propensities, united in hymeneal&#xD;
bands. His was a nature which never forgave or forgot an injury,&#xD;
whether supposed or real, whether intended or accidental; and&#xD;
consequently deep and long might she expect his revenge to be,&#xD;
for the test to which she had subjected his love ; and though she&#xD;
had married him because his wealth would enable her to enjoy&#xD;
all those luxuries, and all that pride and display to which she had&#xD;
been accustomed, had she seen correctly into his disposition, few&#xD;
of those indulgences would she have expected to receive, for he&#xD;
was niggardly to excess. 'Tis true, that as far as self was con-&#xD;
cerned, few could be more liberal; but his bounty never extended&#xD;
beyond that narrow limit, and little likely would he be brilliantly&#xD;
to add new beauties to her whom his natural jealousy would tend&#xD;
to make him confine to his own sight only, or to bestow upon her&#xD;
any means to excite that admiration from which he had determined&#xD;
to debar her. He married her because she was a belle ; and as&#xD;
he had many rivals, he gloried in bearing off the prize; but he&#xD;
resolved from the hour which made her his own, that she should&#xD;
be excluded from that society which constituted her only happi-&#xD;
ness, and that the beauty which she so much prized should only&#xD;
be exposed to his own admiring gaze. With such feelings to-&#xD;
wards each other, small was the probability of their happiness.&#xD;
George Witherington waited only until his sisters were married&#xD;
to go to Alabama, and endeavor in that sunny clime to acquire a&#xD;
fortune, which he had all his life expected to inherit, but which&#xD;
he was now conscious that if he ever possessed, it must be the&#xD;
fruit of his own exertions.&#xD;
As the fortunes of the family sunk, Robert gave himself up&#xD;
more and more to the brutal indulgence of the intoxicating bowl,&#xD;
until he became a castaway from his family and friends.&#xD;
Mrs. Witherington remained a while in Newport; but finding&#xD;
her home too desolate, she yielded to the earnest solicitations of&#xD;
Mr. Thorn and Harriet, and went to spend with them the re-&#xD;
mainder of her days.&#xD;
Our old friend, Miss Hoxie, survived but a few months the&#xD;
death of her beloved Nancy. She appeared afterwards to have&#xD;
&#xD;
EMMA STANLEY, OR THE ORPHANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
161&#xD;
&#xD;
no energy, and she lost all interest in every thing. For a few&#xD;
weeks she went about the house like one who had no object in&#xD;
life, and then she took to her bed, and without any apparent dis-&#xD;
ease, and without any complaint, she went to meet in a better&#xD;
world one whom she had followed so faithfully in this.&#xD;
Mr. Chapman died soon after ; but Mrs. Chapman still sur-&#xD;
vives in a green old age, and the mountains lift their majestic&#xD;
brows, and mighty rivers roll their waters to the ocean, between&#xD;
herself and Emma ; yet she still continues to be in part her guide&#xD;
and counsellor, while to those in her immediate circle she is still&#xD;
the Christian friend, the consoler of their troubles, and the cheer-&#xD;
ful partaker of their delights ; but always taking every opportu-&#xD;
nity, whether in sorrow or joy, to lift their souls to heaven and&#xD;
make them thankful to the Giver of good, or resigned to the&#xD;
afflictive providences of their Father and their God.&#xD;
Richard is married to her who was the first and only idol of&#xD;
his heart. Emma has seen, and seeing she has loved his wife ;&#xD;
for it has been the lot of few to know, and not to love, her whom&#xD;
we have known as Mary Dampier, but of whom we will take&#xD;
leave as Mary Stanley. Perhaps at some future time we may&#xD;
continue to trace the fortunes of Emma ; but at present our task&#xD;
is finished, and we will leave her happy in her brother's home,&#xD;
which she considers as a haven of rest, where she will enjoy a&#xD;
life of contentedness and affection, and where a brother's love&#xD;
can shield her from all the storms of care.&#xD;
