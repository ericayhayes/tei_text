We meet again. One, of whom Carlyle saith&#xD;
that he was "the greatest soul in, a England," said&#xD;
of his great WQrk, that it was written, "not in the soft&#xD;
obscurities of retirement, nor under the shade of' ~,a-&#xD;
demic bowers; but amid inconvenience and distraeti~n,&#xD;
in sickness and in sorrow." If he could thus apologize&#xD;
for possible imperfection, will you not have patience&#xD;
with the shortcomings of&#xD;
Your humble servant,&#xD;

stuffed receptacles. 'The avenues to these were worn&#xD;
much in the same way, II fancy, as The marble monu~&#xD;

pilgrims. . Was any thing lost? You might "qualify"&#xD;
(as they say in Virginia) that it or its counterpart&#xD;
would come "forth, in visible resurrection, at her all-&#xD;
potent conjuration.&#xD;
On sundry days, during every week, you might see&#xD;
her, with her gown Wost unroman4cally tucked up, and&#xD;
hanging around her like a gaff-topsail when the sheet&#xD;
has parted, mopping the floor which, to the ken of less&#xD;
sharp-sighted mortals, was already immaculate. 'Where.-&#xD;

with an economically-treasured piece of pie, and a trifle&#xD;
of raspberry-jam, instead of a somewhat more compul-&#xD;
sory jam in my egress from the kitchen.&#xD;
MeanWhile, her tongue moved in sympathetic' activi-&#xD;

cl~ter. Was~ my cap left on the table, or hung on the&#xD;

Yet, dear reader, she was one of the very best 'women&#xD;

mislaid; and the storm was long in subsiding. On&#xD;
these occasions, Ann West would put on as martyr-like&#xD;
a look, as I have seen reformers wear at a county&#xD;
meeting.&#xD;
And then ! in the morning, at cock-crowing, might&#xD;
her voice be heard, high-upraised in matin shrillness. I&#xD;
hear it now.&#xD;

cheek. The words that begin this chapter were the&#xD;
last shots of the belligerents. I slink sulkily away,&#xD;
conscience-smitten, all abashed; yet smarting under the&#xD;
sense of arbitrary power unjustly exerted. She had&#xD;
hid my ball, and she seemed to enjoy the sense of&#xD;
superiority and control. How I dreaded my father's&#xD;
coming! He entered, and, with the 'care-worn look of&#xD;
a busy day, passed me without notice, and went directly&#xD;
to the office'.. Ann' West followed him, and my first&#xD;
impulse was to follow her and defend myself. Pride&#xD;
said-&#xD;
"No; if he will listen to ,4er, and condemE me un-&#xD;
heard, so be it. It is but another flogging."&#xD;
It was an unlucky day, that, for my father.' A bale&#xD;
of' his best goods had been carelessly dropped from the&#xD;
gangway-plank, in discharging "The Eriipress" at the&#xD;
wharf. Fogg &amp;amp; Gibson had failed, and rumour said that&#xD;
claims against them would not pay. forty cents on the&#xD;
dollar. Henry Parker, the best of his teamsters, had&#xD;
got drunk, and lamed Dash, his favourite horse; and it&#xD;
is, therefore, no matter of marvel that he was not very&#xD;
well prepared'to sit in judgment on the grave complaint&#xD;
so unexpectedly presented. I was ca~Iled to the office.&#xD;
"Come here, sir!"&#xD;
I obeyed.&#xD;
"What have you been doing ?"&#xD;
"Ann hid my ball, and"-~---&#xD;
"Oh-h-h-h I"' exclaimed Ann, ~ Ia 'Kemble. "I don't&#xD;
know nothing' about his ball. I"-&#xD;
"Aiid so you threw the gridiron at her ?"&#xD;
"No, sir;~.only the shears."&#xD;
"* Did you hide his ball, Ann ?"&#xD;
"I'm sure I"-&#xD;
"She did, father !"&#xD;
"Hush! Go and cut a stick."&#xD;
I obeyed-and was flogged. Oh! how the memory&#xD;
~of" my logging stings me, even now! But the fault,&#xD;
my dear reader, was not my father's. It belonged to&#xD;
4h~ day. 'It was the regime of the~ rod, and I do. not&#xD;
&#xD;
(God forbid me that I should!) write a reproachful&#xD;
word of him' at whose feet, were he alive, I would gladly.&#xD;
kneel and beg to be; forgiven. He was one of ~he&#xD;
world's great hearts; generous, honest, .unsuspecting,&#xD;
warm-hearted; full of all noble and manly impulses. He&#xD;
was tall, and of commanding presence; soni~what in-&#xD;
dined to corpulency. He was well-formed and erect ~&#xD;
and his native energy gave a fine expression to his well-&#xD;
cut and somewhat remarkable features. He was im-&#xD;
pulsive, yet ever benevolent, considerate, and just; yet&#xD;
he was not self-trustful enough to appear to others, unless&#xD;
they knew him well, in his true character. Hence he~&#xD;
was sometimes thought haughty and proud; thc~ugh&#xD;
never overbearing.&#xD;
I crept away that night to my bed, sobbing in the&#xD;
bitterness of boyish grief. It was long ere I s!ept, and&#xD;
my pillow was drenched with tears. At length II rose,&#xD;
dressed, and went to the office.&#xD;
"Father !" I said, timidly.&#xD;
"Be oft' to bed, sir !" was the reply.&#xD;
I had gone to him with my heart full, penitent,&#xD;
longing to tell him why I had quarrelled with the ho~ise-&#xD;
keeper. I did not know then, as I know now, of that&#xD;
day's catalogue of misfortunes. Was it a marvel that&#xD;
the warm current of good feelings was frozen into tear-&#xD;
less anger and indignant rebellion? To this feeling&#xD;
succeeded calmness. With calmness came reflection~;&#xD;
and, as I reviewed the scenes of The day, and 'of 'recent&#xD;
life, boyhoodd does not look far 'back,) and recalled'my&#xD;
father's kindness, I wept bitterly. Sorrow does not&#xD;
long brood over young hearts. I fell asleep.&#xD;
When I awoke next morning, I looked out at the&#xD;
narrow window of my little chamber: the sash was&#xD;
covered with snow. The day was just breaking. I&#xD;
sprang eagerly from my bed. I remember giving a&#xD;
delighted glance at my skates, which my father had&#xD;
given me a. few days before, and promising myself a&#xD;
merry winter. Going down to the sitting-room, I raked&#xD;
open the coals in the huge fireplace, (those were the&#xD;

primitive days of BoyThton,) and built what we called,&#xD;
in those days, "a rousing fire." There was a recess&#xD;
on the eastern side of the room, which my father al-&#xD;
ways directed "the hired man" to keep filled with&#xD;
wood; and, as the wood for that winter had providently&#xD;
been cut a year previously, it was but a few moments&#xD;
'before I had the room comfortably warm.&#xD;
As I was trying on my cap, my father came in.&#xD;
"Ah! Lyxide; so you've beaten me this morning ?"&#xD;
and he bent over me and kissed me. "You are up&#xD;
early. How do you propose to spend the day, J4nde ?"&#xD;
"1 don't know, sir.&#xD;
"Is there any school ?"&#xD;
"No, sir."&#xD;
"Would you like to go with me t~ Fairfield ?"&#xD;
I hesitated.&#xD;
".1 would rather go and see Mrs. Warren," I said,&#xD;
at length, seeing that he waited for my decision.&#xD;
"I could have sworn it," said my father, a little bit-&#xD;
terly. "You love your father and mother Warren, as&#xD;
you~ call them, better than you do me, I'm afraid."&#xD;
I hung my head, and made no reply~&#xD;
"Would you cry, if I refused ?"&#xD;

"Well, you may go and spend Thanksgiving with&#xD;
them. Let me see. To-day~s the twenty-third--4he&#xD;
twenty-third of November, and not a stick of timber&#xD;

"Paul will be here this morning."&#xD;
"Sure enough. There he is, now."&#xD;

PAUL WAUREN.-I3UNDLING UP.-THE RID1~.&#xD;
I LOOKED out at the window. There was Warren..&#xD;
lie was a labourer; one of the true nobility of "this&#xD;
work-day world." Well is it called so; and Shaks~&#xD;
peare can hardly have been the first to give it the&#xD;
happy appellation. A great deal more thab. six-sevenths&#xD;
of the suns that make up the circle of the year, look&#xD;
continually upon the plodding of toil; and. night often&#xD;
has few hours of rest fof it. By far the Jarger portion&#xD;
of "the great family" have fulfilled, most literally, the&#xD;
doom of *labour-a doom wherein, if our mothei~earth&#xD;
were accursed for the sins of her children, she hath in&#xD;
meekness turned her cheek to the smiter; while she&#xD;
hath overwhelnied- us with blessings. How few of her&#xD;
millions have left us their names or histories to swell the&#xD;
"Short and simple annals of' the poor !"&#xD;
Paul Warren was not one who talked much about&#xD;
labour. He had not learned the fashionable phrases in'&#xD;
which many "a brave stringer of words" has sought to&#xD;
deify it. He was a practical worker, worth whole re-&#xD;
giments of its rhetorical eulogi~ts.&#xD;
I see him now as I jaw him then. His 'homely&#xD;
teamster's hat (a hat is one of the first things that&#xD;
* catch your eye in looking at a man) was, the least in&#xD;
the world, set aside from the perpendicular. towards&#xD;
the right ear. His black eye sparkled, and his cheek&#xD;
was flushed with his morning's walk; (he had ceme&#xD;
three miles, through the snow, fr~tn his mountain~girt&#xD;
cabin;) and the ends of his long, raven hair were covered&#xD;
with the . half-melted snow. His usual smile li~ up his&#xD;

the necks of the oxen, as if some pleasant thought&#xD;
of Mary Warren and her rosy-cheeked children had&#xD;
crossed his mind. I could watch him no longer: I&#xD;
know not how I could do it so long. I bounded from&#xD;
the door, and plunging through the snow, which had&#xD;
fallen, already, to the depth of more than a fOOtr I&#xD;
leaped upon his back just as he was placing an axe, in&#xD;
a hole cut purposely for it, in the, rail of the huge&#xD;

And the teamster hugged me in his brawny arms&#xD;

"' By the powers! Lynde," (it was his favourite af-&#xD;
firmation,) "I'm glad to see you. Why, it's a week, my&#xD;
boy, since you've been to see us! Good morning,&#xD;
Uncle George." (Everybody, almost, called my father&#xD;
so.) "I think we'll have to make a lumberman ~'&#xD;
Lynde."&#xD;
"I shall be glad if we are ever able to make any&#xD;
thing half so good of him," replied my father. He&#xD;
lacked trust, reader. It 'was one of his few faults; and&#xD;
there were few who would admit that George Weiss&#xD;
had any faults.,&#xD;
"Never you fear that, Uncle George. Never you&#xD;
fear! Give him to me, if you don't want him."&#xD;
"I suppose I might as well do so, Paul," said my&#xD;
father; "for you've bewitched the boy, in the moun-&#xD;
tains. I believe he would rather stay there than at&#xD;
home with me."'~&#xD;
"To be sure he would; for".-.&#xD;
He said the remainder 0r the sentence in so low a&#xD;
tone that I could not hear; but I was sure I knew the&#xD;
import of it. I did prefer living with Paul' Warren&#xD;
and his excellent wife to remaining at home with my&#xD;
father and sisters. Nor was this at all a matter of&#xD;
itnarvel. I had lost my mother in early infancy. For&#xD;
several years succeeding that calamity-the worst that&#xD;
can happen 'to a ~hild~-'J had been under the care of&#xD;
&#xD;
Paul and Mazy Warren, in their romantic home amoiig&#xD;
the mountains. There, I had never heard an angry&#xD;
tone, never seen an angry look, or a blow in chastise-&#xD;
ment. , There, I was sure of kindness, uniform and&#xD;
constant. There, I had found one to whom I was dear~&#xD;
~and who loved me (woman-like) all the more .for my&#xD;
great and irretrievable misfortune. There,, a hearty&#xD;
smile, a kiss, an embrace, or, what is better, a genuine&#xD;
maternal hug, (that's the good old Danish word for 'it,&#xD;
worth a thousand classical substitutes,) was ever my&#xD;
welcome. There were no arms in which my bruises&#xD;
(I was, always falling headlong) were so , soon robbed&#xD;
of their pain; none wherein the storm of soieams ~tnd&#xD;
sobs was so gently, lulled to stillness, rest, peacefulness&#xD;
and sleep. My playthings were cared for religiously.&#xD;
Neither Charles nor Ruth Warren,-.-not the youngestt.&#xD;
children even, (there were seven of them all,)-.were a1~~&#xD;
lowed to molest Old Troy,. 'the dog, because ii loved&#xD;
him. Was there any species of food that I expressed&#xD;
a preference for? It was sure to be. near my plate.&#xD;
Your pardon, reader. I should extend the descrip-'&#xD;
tion to pages, were I sure that any words of mine could&#xD;
make Mary Warren stand before you in fresh, loving,&#xD;
matronly, pure, religious LIFE, as she is now present to&#xD;
me,-.as she has been present to me, waking and in my.&#xD;
dreams, in many a clime of t~ie earth.&#xD;
"What shall I do to-day ?" asked Warren~&#xD;
"As to-day is Saturday, Paul, you had best spend ~t&#xD;
in getting your family supplies, and in hauling aiid&#xD;
cutting a good supjAy ot wood fGr your wife. '1 hope&#xD;
she and her little ones are well."&#xD;
"As hearty as bucks."&#xD;
"Well, call at the store," (shops in the country are&#xD;
invariably so called,) "as you go along, and Henry will&#xD;
hand you a little package of* winter-comforts.' Ask'&#xD;
Mary to accept it from me. There, no thanks, Paul.&#xD;
I can never repay her for all she has done for me arid&#xD;
for this youngster. By the way, he wants to go hoirie&#xD;
with you."&#xD;

"Of course he does, Uncle George. Let him go.&#xD;
Bundle up, Lynde, and we'll be off. Where's your&#xD;
coat and mittens? By the powers! I'd almost forgot&#xD;
it, boy! Here's a pairs of* bran'-new mittens that&#xD;
Mary's been knitting you~"&#xD;
I ran, with boyish eagerness, for my capacious coat.&#xD;
The omnipresent housekeeper met me at the door.&#xD;
"What's to pay, Lyjade ?"&#xD;
"I'm going home."&#xD;
"Home? Why, you're. at home now."&#xD;
"Well, to Paul Warren's, then."&#xD;
And now commenced the process of bundling up--a&#xD;
process which has a great deal of profanity to answer&#xD;
for by.~and-by. I would rather have gone with merely&#xD;
an additional coat. But no! Ann's kindliness now&#xD;
labouringly and fermentingly found vent in the prepara-&#xD;
tions for the ride. First, tho~ ear-pieces of my cap&#xD;
were let down and tied under my chin. Then I donned&#xD;
an overcoat big enough for Cardinal Wolsey, who,&#xD;
everybody knows, was&#xD;
"A man of unbounded stomach !"*&#xD;
#'&#xD;
Then a pair of yarn stockings, despite, my remon-&#xD;
~j.    strances, were drawn over my boots; ~then a comforter&#xD;
was tied, fold on fold, around my neck; and, over all,&#xD;
the large-hearted Ann would fain have piled an old&#xD;
camlet cloak; which had been visible from time whereof&#xD;
the memory of man runnetli not to the contrary.&#xD;
Against this last A~1tnean imposition, however, I suc-&#xD;
cessfully rebelled. But, then, a bundle was to be pu~&#xD;
up, ccmsisting of fruit, cakes, candy-what not ?-for&#xD;
the children. Thus freighted and fortified, (against&#xD;
the. cold,) despite an outpouring of injunctions touching&#xD;
&#xD;
* One of the l~eartiest laughs I ever had or saw, was in reading&#xD;
that remark of Orimths' to an elderly, fat lady, not particularly&#xD;
well read in the drama-or any thing else-who gave it its literal&#xD;
and most obvious interpretation.&#xD;

&#xD;
in their merry peal. Paul hummed the aii of one of&#xD;
the raftsmen's songs. The cattle swayed their huge,&#xD;
clumsy frames in an ungainly gait. The runners&#xD;
grazed roughly and gratingly over the frozen hobs,&#xD;
which were not yet beaten doww; while from the neigh-&#xD;
bouring woods rang, sharply and merrily, some stout&#xD;
woodman's axe. And, now and then, you might hear&#xD;
a' hearty' laugh, or a distant ,shout, or the sharp ring&#xD;
from the rifle of a hunter early astir, waking the woods,&#xD;
leagues .around, with' echoes.&#xD;
We halted at the store. Henry 'Towner, the. 9lerk,&#xD;
handed to Paul a goodly package; and I took the op-&#xD;
&#xD;

4&#xD;
&#xD;
the wetting of my feet, I survived Ann's assiduities,&#xD;
and sallied forth unwieldily towards the sled.&#xD;
"Stay to breakfast, Paul," said my father..&#xD;
"Thank you. I breakfasted two hours ago. IBut&#xD;
this little shaver must have"-.&#xD;
"No, I don't want ~any !" said I, eagerly.&#xD;
"Well, then, off we: go. Good morning, Unole&#xD;
George."&#xD;
"Good morning, Paul. My love to* Mary and the&#xD;
youngsters; and take good care of this boy, will you ?"&#xD;
"Never fear for that !1~ said Paul, heartily; and,&#xD;
with a loud, ringing "Whoa! haw, Buck ! back, Bright!&#xD;
come along here, Ii say !" he set his cattle in motion&#xD;
towards the mountains. I ceased to fret at the bun-&#xD;
bling process which I had survived and when we were&#xD;
out of sight from the house, I threw off the overcoat&#xD;
and comforter; pulled the stockings from off my new&#xD;
cow-hide boots, (of which I was as proud as my lord-&#xD;
mayor of his new coach ;*) leaped from the huge lumber-&#xD;
sled into the snow, and followed the merry woodman&#xD;
beside his teani. The cold had no terrors for me; for&#xD;
1 had been ridiculed into defying it.&#xD;
We jogged onward but slowly in the yet untrodden&#xD;
snow. The sleigh-bells were already heard in&#xD;

The reader who is familiar with the geography of&#xD;
North-eastern New York,---irny o.ne, indeed, who has&#xD;
e~ver been on Lake Champlain,-~-.knows right well, that,&#xD;
as you sail from Split Rock northward, you see the&#xD;
Green Mountains on your right-Mansfield and Camel's&#xD;
liuznp usually covered with snow; and, on the left, the&#xD;
low, but many-shaped and picturesque mountains of&#xD;
Essex., IBoylston, as every body knows, is situated on&#xD;
the Bouquet-a small, but most beautiful river, whick&#xD;
winds romantically among the inequalities of the hill-&#xD;
country towards Lak~IJhamplain. The village is, per~&#xD;
haps, a mile and a half from the mouth of the river;&#xD;
and, in rowing to the lake, you pass between chores&#xD;
overhung with the beautiful vegetation of the Northern&#xD;
forests, decrying .new beauties in every furlong of the&#xD;
way; here, a point studded with the dwarfish pines,&#xD;
h~mloek, spruce, birch, or~4lr; there, a bay With ~its.&#xD;
eddies and shadows, in which the fish are leaping above&#xD;
the surface; and again, an islet where Blannerhasset&#xD;
might have been content to dwell. One of ~these, by-&#xD;
the-by, is the scene of a story of which I may some&#xD;
day, give the reader the details. And then, as you&#xD;
reach the mouth, the lake is before you. Oh! that I&#xD;
could see it again!&#xD;
I've roamed in lands of' southern suns,&#xD;
Far over. the heaving main;&#xD;
But fairer than the waters there&#xD;
Is nioi~ntain-girt Champlain.&#xD;
The prairie-turf has been my couch,&#xD;
I've passed its seas of grain,*&#xD;
But fairer far than they to me,&#xD;

At solemn altars have I knelt,&#xD;
In many-columr~ed Lane;&#xD;
-     But nobler altars are the hills&#xD;
That frown o'er blue Champlain.&#xD;
&#xD;
The ashes of the hotiour dead,&#xD;
At Freedom's altar slal&#xD;
liest there in silence on the shore&#xD;
Of glorious Champlain.&#xD;
Red Battle's hoofs have trod its banks,&#xD;
And left their gory stain;&#xD;
And "hearts of oak" died gloriously&#xD;
In story-famed Champlain.&#xD;
In life's dim gloamin~ may my feet&#xD;
Tread those old hills again!,&#xD;
My ear be gladdened bythe swell&#xD;
Of beautiful Champlain I&#xD;
Over hill and\ through valley did we ~plod the way&#xD;
while Paul gave, me some account of the plans for~ tWo&#xD;
winter. "The En~press" would soon be laid up. The&#xD;
Lumbermen's, Lodge was to be put in repair ; and,&#xD;
during the following week, twenty stout choppers were&#xD;
to be sent into the woods~&#xD;
"We shall have fine times this winter, Lynde," said&#xD;
he; "and I'll coax the old. gentleman to let, you spend&#xD;
a week with us at the Lodge. Hang the schoQl I Yen&#xD;
shouldn't go near it these five years, if I had my way.&#xD;
The schoolmasters are but a pack of asks, to my think-&#xD;
ing, as a geiwral thing-and I'd like to see you free.&#xD;
Eli, Lynd~ ~" (here he slapped me. furiously on tho&#xD;
back.) " Nothing like freedom, boy; and the school-&#xD;
masters are so jealous of their dignity, that they make&#xD;
poor~ crouching slaves of boys, where they should malco&#xD;
men-stout-hearted, fearless, free. I shall die ~. hater&#xD;

"Th&amp;amp;e's the bridge I" I shouted, as we came in&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
THE WOODMAN'S HOME.&#xD;
HE .wa~ right.' We had emerged from the woods&#xD;
into a small "clearing," containing, perhaps, twenty&#xD;
acres. In fierce and somewhat gloomy contrast with&#xD;
the stainless, untrodden snow, rose, in grim stateliness,&#xD;
the black, fire-charred pines, with countless stumps be-&#xD;
tween them, over which they stood with a sentry.like&#xD;
sternness that used to make my heart quake with un-&#xD;
defluiiable terror. Some of them were branchless,&#xD;
while. others. stretched. gropingly, with a blind man's&#xD;
awkward aimlessness, into the' wintry 'space around&#xD;
them', a~ if yearning; in their bereavement, foi' their&#xD;
scioi~s ruthlessly cut down by the stalwart' reapers of'&#xD;
Those grand, old woods."&#xD;
This' clearing was on the 'right of the road. On the&#xD;
left, the woods were~ yet untouched by the~ axe;' 'and&#xD;
thus, .wi'th' the forest on one side, and the clearing on&#xD;
the ether, we were approaching the house. This was&#xD;
now plainly in sight.&#xD;
~*On the brow of a recently cleared hillock, on which&#xD;
the blackened stumps were still standing, was Charles&#xD;
~Warren~ 1k was ~a fine, rosy..cheeked little~feflow, one&#xD;
year' 4d~r than ni~y~elf; and he wap now waddling&#xD;
stoittl~r,~'but clumsily, ~towards us, 'through the yet un-&#xD;
i~te*i snow. He had~learned~ practically, the wisdom&#xD;
of the Asses' Bridge; for, instead of keeping the high~&#xD;
way, to gain' which he must have gone some two hun-&#xD;
dred yards from the house, in a direction perpendicular&#xD;
to the road, he 'took the hypotenuse of the right-&#xD;
angled triangle, and was approaching us through 'the&#xD;
&#xD;
LYNDID WEISS.&#xD;
&#xD;
fields. On he came, puffing like a grampus; his coni-&#xD;
cal woollen cap leaning jauntily over, and bending low&#xD;
under the weight of a huge yarn tassel. With a bois-.&#xD;
terous shout, jhe mounted the~ rude fence, and 'leaped&#xD;
from the 'topmost log (for. of logs was it built): into the"&#xD;
snow.&#xD;
"Well done, Charley! That's right, my.: boy!&#xD;
Never be afraid of the snow! Here's Lynde. come to'&#xD;
see you !"&#xD;
Our 'greeting was right' hearty. We had been play-&#xD;
fellows together,' over' hill and through valley 'and&#xD;
woodland. He had, unlike myself, a very reten.tive.&#xD;
memory; and it was stored with long-hoarded treasures.&#xD;
of nursery lore. These he was ever ready to relate~ to&#xD;
me, in a monotone which rings in my ears, as I wn~te;&#xD;
and countless were the nights when he related, With&#xD;
the patience and pi'olixity of the narratress of the Ara~.&#xD;
bian Tales, stories of' witches, ghosts) goblins, fairies,&#xD;
and giants, parts of which' I still imperfectly remember~&#xD;
The ~house was~ now plainly in sight. It was of logs-&#xD;
a single story, with small narrow windows. At each&#xD;
end was a rude chimney of sticks, covered with plaster,&#xD;
one of them whitewashed. In front of it. was a; large'&#xD;
pile of green wood, with the day's supply cut into&#xD;
sticks about a fathom in length. Some of these were&#xD;
maple~~-the finest wood in the world to burn.-.and not&#xD;
less than fifteen or twenty* inches in diameter. Near.&#xD;
this wood-pile was an unfinished well.. To the left was.&#xD;
a stabIe,~ with a capacious hay-loft. . The building was,&#xD;
always called "The Hovel." Still' farther in the. ~am@~&#xD;
direction wa~the barn. ' This, as well: as the Hovel, was~i&#xD;
of logs; 'and' the 'roofs of the three buildings were&#xD;
rough, veiny pine boards.&#xD;
Turning abrt~~tly around the corner of th~~nee,~we~&#xD;
were in full view' of the house. Old Troy~, who was&#xD;
lounging about the yard, cooked 'his :ears gs'he caught&#xD;
sight of us, ~n'd set out at the pq~ de a~q~ towards&#xD;
the intrudera. I1~e did" 'n~ot stop until within~, a fathom&#xD;
of the headÂ§ of our cattle, when it seemed', t~ oeeur. to&#xD;

him that he might have mistaken the character of ~the&#xD;
new-corners; and he therefore ~et both his fore..feet&#xD;
down together, coming to an abrupt halt, with a half-&#xD;
suppressed ugl&amp;amp;! His quick eye caught that of his&#xD;
master, and he commenced a series 61~ frolics around&#xD;
the sled, eyeing each* of us in turn, wagging his tail&#xD;
most' furiously, barking now and. then, and performing&#xD;
divers antics not announced in any bill of canine the-&#xD;
atricals. We interpreted~ them all (and he need never&#xD;
have been at so much trouble) into a very emphatic&#xD;
assurance that we were as welcome as the flowers in&#xD;
May. He was a large, fin&amp;amp;looking, shaggy Newfound-&#xD;
land, and, I need. scarcely add, a great favourite.&#xD;
As Paul brought the, team to a~ stand with a loud&#xD;
"W~xoa!" Ruth's curly head emerged from the door,&#xD;
and with a "Oh! oh! oh! oh! father's come back 1"&#xD;
she bounded along, bare-headed, through the snow to&#xD;
meet us. Tier shout attracted the. notice of. the other&#xD;
youngsters; and forth, in no very military order, came&#xD;
her three sisters, Mary,' Judith, and Jane. Little Paul&#xD;
followed, and, in a moment more, Mary Warren ap~&#xD;
peaked' at' the door. There was little noise in our&#xD;
greetings. More than any household I have ever seen,&#xD;
Paul Warren's was noted for 'its cheerful quiet. Not&#xD;
that the children had been taught to sit erect and silent&#xD;
in their several chairs; not that fear kept them still.&#xD;
Nothing like it It was. the mother's silent and unseen,&#xD;
but controlling tone of manner, which, by a kind of&#xD;
mesmerism I cannot explain, gave character to the&#xD;
whole. If I may venture to say what seems to me to&#xD;
have been the secret of her influence, it was affection;'&#xD;
and, 'with a pardonable alteration of a single word, I&#xD;
might here use Talfourd's beautiful lines in his' descrip-&#xD;
tion of Ion:'&#xD;
'~ Love, the germ&#xD;
~Of ~her mild uature, hath shed graces forth,&#xD;
J~xpauiiug with its progress ; as the sto~'e&#xD;

&#xD;
We were soon at the door.. It was a rude one, of&#xD;
pine. The latch; was of wood, and a stout leather&#xD;
string hung' outside, wherewithal to lift it. In one&#xD;
corner of the door was a little trap-door, cut for the&#xD;
sole benefit and behoof of a huge gray cat, and so con-&#xD;
trived that puss had but to apply ~her head to it, and&#xD;
enter or leave the house.&#xD;
It was but a few minutes before I was rid of my&#xD;
huge coat, my cap and mittens, and seated with the&#xD;
children, just as near the mother's chair as it was pos-&#xD;
sible for us to get. Would that you could have seen&#xD;
her, thus surrounded by her children I She was, per-&#xD;
haps, thirty-five ;~yet so hardly had she been nurtured,'~'*&#xD;
in the clear air of the mountains, that you would have&#xD;
said she could not be older ' than twenty-five o1six.&#xD;
She was faultlessly formed, and 'her figure was admira-&#xD;
bly developed into that 'style' of healthful beauty for&#xD;
which Englishwomen are so remarkable. You would&#xD;
notice, sooner and oftener than, any thing else, her&#xD;
head. There waa a beauty of symmetry in its classic&#xD;
outline, which you would have gazed upon. again and&#xD;
again, wondering the while what it could be that s~&#xD;
thrilled your pulses with the sense of beauty. And&#xD;
then the 'large, love-speaking eyes, 'which no shade of&#xD;
anger: ever dimmed, and which need never have falle~&#xD;
for the thoughts of the heart which spoke in every&#xD;
glance. Her long, dark-brown hair was combed back,~&#xD;
as you see it in the pictures of 'the Madonna, (I never&#xD;
saw one that~ equalled Mary Warren in that style~ of&#xD;
matronly beauty~ which artists so 'much covet as a&#xD;
model,) and~ gathered' in a kuot.~ Then she was always&#xD;
so neatly and tastefully, though plainly clad. There&#xD;
was harmony visible in her wholi nature.&#xD;
'0 Mary Warren, my more 'than mother, God bless&#xD;
you! How often, 'in the darker hours of my life, have&#xD;
IL felt the' influences of your early teachings! How&#xD;
often' have I felt that there must be truth in the&#xD;
doctrine of a sensible intercoinmunion of the spirits ef&#xD;
those who love one another, though. leagues apart.&#xD;

Paul caine in and announced to us the unwelcome&#xD;
news that he must-~be' off . to the woods to haul a supply&#xD;
of firewood, as lie would be absent for several days of&#xD;
the ensuing week.&#xD;
I was once more at home. I felt that there' I was&#xD;
loved in spite of ~wy faults-and they were many. I&#xD;
do not doubt 14~at' my father, my brother, and my. sis-&#xD;
ters also loved me; but (I shall have more to say of&#xD;
4~hem presently) they were not what I believe it is usual&#xD;
to call demonstrative. Why they were not so, it is not&#xD;
for le to say. The fault may have boon wholly mine.&#xD;
Certain~ it is, that P would sooner have given my~ last&#xD;
crust or 'copper fQr Mary Warren than for any of my&#xD;
kindred. I believe I could have died for her. AtT&#xD;
hQme I was never caressed. There was no kiss, no.&#xD;
embrace for me there. There was no care for my&#xD;
tastes and whims. My toys were rudely kicked out of&#xD;
the way, or hid, or thrown in the fire: My better flaw&#xD;
tu'e was not appealed to. I was under the r4qime of&#xD;
FORCE; and every fibre of my puny frame rebelled as&#xD;
~'heartily as did Lucifer. They did not trust me; and&#xD;
they are so kind as to assure me that I was the black-&#xD;
est~. homeliest, worst-tempQred brat that ever lay in a&#xD;
cradle!&#xD;
Yes, I was once more at home. . The magic of that&#xD;
mother's smile disarmed every feeling 'of stubbornness&#xD;
and ill-temper. I was in a new atmosphere4 The old&#xD;
story it is, in briefs. I loved and w~s Iove~d. Oh.! how&#xD;
supremely happy was 1, as I looked around me for the&#xD;
fa'~niliar objects of my :infant home.. There was the&#xD;
~huge old fireplace, 'eight feet wide if it was one, and&#xD;
almost as many feet high0 An iron-wood pole rai~&#xD;
across it,. on whi~h were hung divers rude pot-hooks,&#xD;
and~. a fragment of a log-chain. The hearth was of&#xD;
.wide~ fiat. stones. ~Xhere were. two large stones that&#xD;
&#xD;
served for andirons, (for. Paul Warren was poor;) and&#xD;
above them were huge blazing logs, that kept the&#xD;
house comfortably warm. In one corner of the room.&#xD;
was a bed. Scattered here and there were a few rude&#xD;
chairs; and in one corner of the hearth was a, bench&#xD;
capable of seating two or three persons. In the oppo-&#xD;
site corner of the apartment was a large cupboard.&#xD;
Near this was a deal table, and over it was suspended&#xD;
a small old-fashioned mirror. Near this hung. an&#xD;
almanac. Overhead were hook~ and poles, on~ which&#xD;
were hung. divers articles of dress. On one of them&#xD;
were some strings of apples, hung there to dry; and on&#xD;
another were bits of pumpkin already dry, and shri-&#xD;
velled into grotesque shapes-the pleasant omens of fu-&#xD;
ture feasts. Over the door, on two' wooden hooks, Was&#xD;
an old-fashioned musket, with a bayonet and belt, pow~&#xD;
der-horn and shot-pouch.' The cat was purring quietly'&#xD;
in the corner; and near Mary Warren, where she 'could&#xD;
reach it with 'her foot, was a capacious cradle, wherein&#xD;
Susan, th~ baby, was asleep.&#xD;
The lower part of the house was divided by a rude&#xD;

room for the family stores, and another for a lodging-&#xD;
room. A ladder, in one corner, gave access to the&#xD;
loft; and a trapAoor, with an iron ring in it, to the&#xD;
cellar.&#xD;
Occupying a moment in loolcingat the familiar ob-&#xD;
jects, I bethought me of my pockets; and, puiling'~out&#xD;
the secreted stores, I distributed them, with boyish de-&#xD;
light, to the children around me~ That day was a&#xD;
jubilee. How often, in the toils and' hardships of after&#xD;
life, have 'I recalled the scene, and lived it over again&#xD;
in the land of dreams! Forth into the snow we sal-&#xD;
lied-Charles, little Paul, and myself,, reinforced by&#xD;
Old Troy, who was that day pressed into the commis-&#xD;
sary department, and did much transportation on a big&#xD;
sled. Poor old Troy! He sleeps the last sleep. Short&#xD;
and 'simple ate the annals of-dogs. Vale I "Ilium-&#xD;

In 'the evening Paul came home. Hauling several&#xD;
of the huge mapledogs into the house, and clearing&#xD;
away the brands, coals, and. ashes from that part of the&#xD;
hearth which was next the chimney-back, he imbedded&#xD;
one in the cavity thus made. The coals and ashes were&#xD;
throwback upon it; and on this he piled another and&#xD;
another. Then he threw upon these the half-consumed&#xD;
brands, with a goodly supply of smaller sticks of wood;&#xD;
and, ere long, that little cabin blazed with the roaring&#xD;
Â£re. ~We gathered around it. Going into a committee&#xD;
of the whole, the children (myself among them) and&#xD;
the dog commenced a series of operations which made&#xD;
~ the roof ring with merriment, and which might have&#xD;
thawed the crustiest bachelor heart in Christendom.&#xD;
Mary Warren smiled happily upon us, as she restlessly&#xD;
plied her knitting-needles, or touched, now~ and then,&#xD;
the rocker of the cradle, while Paul's eyes twinkled&#xD;
and flashed with fun as he watched our mad antics.&#xD;
The hours sped. We retired to our beds; and then, in&#xD;
glaring, panoramic distinctness, did Jack the Giant-&#xD;
killer re-enact his doughty exploits. Charles was the&#xD;
story-teller of the household. I ;lE~~Ui~Od from him all&#xD;
the earlier exploits of the very remarkable slayer of&#xD;
giants'; but somehow the monotonous tone of the stor~&#xD;
got the better of me about the middle of Jack's history,&#xD;
and my next conscious movements were at daybreak.&#xD;
It is, " in contempt of ~question," owing to this last-&#xD;
1~entioned fact, that I have, to this day, no definite&#xD;
idea of the later exploits, sickness, and death, or dying&#xD;
speech and confession, of that very blood-thirsty per-&#xD;
sonage, Jack the Giant-killer. The loss to tradition&#xD;
is irreparable.&#xD;

RIGHT merrily did' 'I ~pass the Thanksgiving. Some&#xD;
of the, relations of the Warrens visited them during th~&#xD;
week-their parents among the number. I spent most&#xD;
of my brief visit with. Charles, in playing lumbermen&#xD;
in' miniature. .We owed much of our success to old&#xD;
Troy, who worked patiently in 'hauling the sled. Wh~n&#xD;
indoors, we amused ourselves, in the good old game of&#xD;
"Foxy and Geese." Paul went to "The-Falls" on the&#xD;
following Saturday, and I returned with. him. Kate&#xD;
and Lucy,' my sisters, received me kindly. My aunt&#xD;
Caroline lifted her glasses over the border of her. prim&#xD;
cap, and smiled  ne a right, hearty welcome; and Anu&#xD;
West, the housekeeper, so far. made cessation of hoa..i&#xD;
utilities as to simply s~iy,~ in a kindly tone,&#xD;
"Don't track the floor~ Ly~de I Please! there's a&#xD;
good boy!"          '&#xD;
And I was quite ready for a diplomatic interchange&#xD;
of promises, by way of treaty. 3'essie Orayson, too,&#xD;
was in the drawing-room with .the rest; and I bashfully&#xD;
sidled u~ to her. and kissed her.&#xD;
'~ Why, Lynde I" exclaimed Ann West and my sis-&#xD;
ters in chorus; but my aunt Caroline reassure me 'by&#xD;
patting'my head, and telling me I- had d~ne right.&#xD;
An excellent old lady was. Caroling Lyade. . Sh~&#xD;
usually spent a few mouths, with u~ every ~y~ar, and I&#xD;
became much attached to her. She defended me in&#xD;
the dom~stie battles, though she neyer' spared rae when&#xD;
I was really. at fault. She was always' busy, usuWly in&#xD;

thinking of scenes far distant. No doubt such was the&#xD;
case; for my uncle Mark Lynde, they told me, was a&#xD;
sailor some years before, and was shipwrecked on the&#xD;
Isle of Shoals.&#xD;
My. sister Lucy was thought pretty. She certainly&#xD;
appeared so to me; for though she was not very pa-&#xD;
tient with her wayward, brother, I loved her de~rly-as&#xD;
well, almost, as I did my sister Kate. When animated,&#xD;
~he was *hat is called a showy girl, ~ind she'was' quite&#xD;
a favourite among the young men of~ the village. She&#xD;
were her hair in curls, (it ~urIed most beautifully,) and,.&#xD;
as it was dark, it threw 'hei~ somewhat strongly-marked&#xD;
features finely into relief. Her complexion was fair.&#xD;
Her blue eye. was a pleasant one, though 'not 'betoken-&#xD;
iiig' any very great depth of feeling. It is more' ex-&#xD;
pi~essive now; *her experience as a wife and mother&#xD;
having given it' character and tone. All in all, she&#xD;
was a well-tempered, fine-looking girl.&#xD;
Kate was 'not at all like her. Sh&amp;amp; ~had dark, very&#xD;
dark hair and eyes. Both were* called' bk~ck. Her.&#xD;
complexion was not~ nearly so fair as that '~of her elder&#xD;
sister. Besides, she was frail as 'a lily. She was sen~&#xD;
sitive, shy, reserved 'Her step' 'was noiseless-her&#xD;
voice ,low and mnusioal-and her smile, though 'not fre-&#xD;
querit,' was' a strangeiy~sweet Qne. when y~u had. once&#xD;
provoked it. She was 'thought homely;' but to me~~-to&#xD;
all, indee4,' who' knew~ her: 'well-~the thought of 'her&#xD;
plainness never occurred. She could well afford to be&#xD;
plain-homely, even; for 'her 'rni~d made you indiffer-&#xD;

'ea'me in.&#xD;
'~W~1I, L~ude, you've got back, eli?"&#xD;
~9~rahi~ was the :greet~in~.' Ceuntiess have been the&#xD;
&#xD;
subsequent pr6ofs of my father's affection; but such&#xD;
wa~ ha mP&amp;amp;ne~; and, for the life of me, just so long as&#xD;
that manner remained, just so long I felt :that I mw*t&#xD;
lack ~he feeling towards him which gushed unbidden at&#xD;
the glance of my' foster father and mother. I feared&#xD;
my father most intensely. . ' '&#xD;
Such was our greeting. Jessie ,and myself, as well&#xD;
as my aunt, the 'housekeeper, and my sisters, 'became&#xD;
very suddenly 'silent. When we did speak, it; was ifl&#xD;
whispers; an~I this. is among the~ reasons why I think&#xD;
my father appealed to the wrong principle for his au-&#xD;
thority. Luckily, as I thought, my 'brother (hi~this'&#xD;
came in. lie was some yeprs my senior; so much. ~o,&#xD;
as to be taking a very considerable 'interest in the de~&#xD;
tails of my father's extensive business. ll~ had~ out-&#xD;
grown, if he had *ever experienced, his fear of parental&#xD;
authority. He was, by his constant association with~,&#xD;
my father, the first to discover the affection that. lurked&#xD;
under'so much apparent sternness. Alone of us all,&#xD;
Griffiths was frank with him.'&#xD;
A noble fellow was that same Gri1~lths ~ a prime fa-&#xD;
vourite' with' young ~and old. Handsome, athletic, am~&#xD;
bitious, companionable, possessed ofmw~h sound sens;&#xD;

to me the well-defined recollection of many a jaunt&#xD;

"SHALL you go to school, Lynde ?" asked Jessie, as&#xD;
we trudge&amp;amp; along.&#xD;
"I must go."&#xD;
"But don't. you U/ce to go? Don't you want' to go ?"&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
Because I get whipped."&#xD;
"That's because you are, naughty sometimes, Lynde."&#xD;
"I knio~. IL a~m ~sometimes; but sometimes they whip.&#xD;
me when I'm not naughty. I've got a great sear now,&#xD;
where Mr. Birch hit me the week before Thanksgiving.&#xD;
See there!"&#xD;
And I bent my head, and showed her a long purple&#xD;
scaron the back of my neck.&#xD;
"Poor Lynde! I'm 80 sorry for you!. Did you&#xD;
show' it to 'your father ?"&#xD;
~ Yes.."&#xD;
"What did 'he say?"&#xD;
~"He laughed, and'said it would make megrow.".&#xD;
"Thexi I dou't~ like' him a bit, and ]~ won't .go to see&#xD;
him any more. I'm sure .mz, father-there he is now,&#xD;
coming for me.&#xD;
II looked~ up. I had been carrying my head down,&#xD;
moodily, as; we were chatting about the school. She&#xD;
was right.'&#xD;
"Ab, 'Lynde! is that you? ~o, you're bringing&#xD;
Jessie h0me to us, eh ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"We1l~ That's neighborly, Lynde. You'll go hOme&#xD;

"Yes eir."&#xD;

It was not long before we were seated, around. a&#xD;
blazing fire at Allan Grayson's. He was the village&#xD;
clergyman. Like most of the' inhabitan~~ of Boyleton;&#xD;
he was ~poor. He had been what is called .a charity-&#xD;
student. He had graduated with honour, and had' been&#xD;
once comfortably settled at a little village, some few&#xD;
miles from Boston. He 'married, soon afterward,. a&#xD;
beautiful girl as poor as himself; and, being an inde~&#xD;
pendent thinker, he formed and broached 'opinionS&#xD;
* which some of "the most straitest" considered he~retb&#xD;
cal. As a matter of course, he wds obliged to seek a&#xD;
new home.. By the merest accident, in the world, he&#xD;
met my father while on~ his way northward, and, catch-&#xD;
ing some portion of his enthusiasm in the glowing ac-&#xD;
count he gave 'of the new country,' Allan Grayson pro'~&#xD;
posed to his wife to accompany the emigrant-party~'&#xD;
To his delight,, she cheerfully acquiesced, 'and, in three&#xD;
days afterward, they'turned their backs upon the pretty&#xD;
village of W-.&#xD;
To me he had always shown a great 'deal of kind.&#xD;
ness. My -father's business habits had enabled him~ td&#xD;
befriend the excellent clergyman and his wife-.and&#xD;
this he was never Weary of doing. It was quite natifral&#xD;
that a warm friendship should spring' up, as it' 'did, be-&#xD;
tween the two families. Indeed, there was no place&#xD;
where my father was so fond of going, especially 'if ~he&#xD;
were glootny or perplexed, as to the Graysons'. Mrs.&#xD;
Grayson was a remarkably still, quiet sort of woman-.&#xD;
and my father loved- quiet.' But, though quiet, and&#xD;
almost taciturn, she was not reserved. She had a&#xD;
world of housewife tact in having one's chair in' the&#xD;
right place; the favourite dish upon the tftble; the&#xD;
exact proportions of Jamaica, and sugar, and egg~, aDd&#xD;
nutmeg, and cream in the egg-nog. Clergymen 'drank&#xD;
egg..nog in those days. She knew, toQhoW-t6 humour&#xD;
my father's whim~-he 'was inclined to be dogmatic&#xD;
flow and then-and, without knowing, why, 'he' #as&#xD;
fully persuaded ~hat~such' another instarice--~f womaidy&#xD;
perfection was never seen. Accordingly, he was sorely&#xD;

disappointed if the clergyman and his wife did not re-&#xD;
~ gularly eat their Sabbath-dinner at his house, and&#xD;
spend at least one or two evenings in the week With my&#xD;
sisters.&#xD;
No marvel, then, that 'the good clergyman WaS kind&#xD;
to me. Jessie was the only ohild; and he often said&#xD;
that he would give the world if he had but a boy.&#xD;
"Never mind, boy," he would' say, "~ou~ shall be my&#xD;
son. I'll teach you Latin and Greek, and give you an&#xD;
inkling of Bon~iycastle; and when you have got your&#xD;
diploma, yoti shall have Jessie."&#xD;
My sister Kate was a favourite with lije wife, and&#xD;
thus the two families had formed, in the trials and pri-&#xD;
vations of their~ forest home, an intimacy and friendship&#xD;
which contributed very largely to* the happiness of&#xD;
both.&#xD;
At nine o'clock my father came for me. He was&#xD;
glad, he said, to have an accuse to drop in and see&#xD;
them all.&#xD;
"I am glad you did, Uncle George." (He had&#xD;
caught the universal appellation;) "Glad you did. I&#xD;
don't get out~ much 'this cold weather, and ~1Eliza is no&#xD;
gad~about. 8he makes Jessie an, excuse for all her&#xD;
shortcomings in repaying our neighbour&amp;amp; visits. Have&#xD;
you seen the new schoolmaster 7"&#xD;
"No.''&#xD;
"The committee giveme a good account of him. I&#xD;
hope Lynda and Jessie will like him, and learn a great&#xD;
deal this winter. You will, won't you, my children 7"&#xD;
"Yes, .sir,"~ said we in chorus.&#xD;
"I've just been telling Lynde," resumed he, laugh-&#xD;
ingly, "that as I've no b~y of my own, I shall have to&#xD;
ad'~pt him~' And I am to teach him Greek and Latin,&#xD;
and ~when he gets his diploma, I'm to give him Miss'&#xD;
Jessie. for a wife."&#xD;
"Bravo, Lynde! Do you hear that, my son 7"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"It might be, after all," said my father, musingly.&#xD;

"It might be, indeed. 8tranger things have happened,&#xD;
myold friend."&#xD;
"I've been thinking, by the way," said' the clergy.&#xD;
man, "that we ought to suggest to Mr.-Mr.---I forget&#xD;
his name."&#xD;
"Wigglesw.6rth 7"&#xD;
"Mr. Wigglesworfih, yes. I have thought of sug~&#xD;
getting to Mr. Wigglesworth-..a queer name by-the-&#xD;
by-to let these little folk go home when the school is&#xD;
half done, 'every day.. Don't you think ft too' long to&#xD;

A SADBA~H IN THE flILL~OUNT~V.'~T~ R!St."~REBELLION.&#xD;
TWO FACES ~ND~R A ~O&amp;amp;D.&#xD;
ThE next day -~as the Sabbath. It dawned over the&#xD;
rude homes of the foresters in beauty. It has always&#xD;
seemd to me that men are more religious among the&#xD;
hills. .Whether- it be because I was born* &amp;amp;mong them,&#xD;
that the remembered forms and tones of those whose&#xD;
nameS are&#xD;
~Woven in the-fibres of the heart"&#xD;
have~made every crag of its el.iffs-every rock, and hill,&#xD;
ad v4ley, ~nd ;s~rearn-~-ever-Y rood of its love-hallowed&#xD;
~war4,~s near to me as the ue~tling to its mother; that&#xD;
there I- knew and loved ~ne whose presence (real to.&#xD;
~ne, eveu~~ when the physical form. is far from me)&#xD;
waked. and nurtured all, the better impulses of my&#xD;
by it~           "My heart,&#xD;
sympathy with one,&#xD;
- Grew b6untiful t~ all ;" -&#xD;
or whether it be that I associate it with "the hill coun-&#xD;
try" of the Holy Land, where the pilgrim's kiss has&#xD;
left its visible it~press upon the marble of the monu-&#xD;
ments, II knew not. But~the Sabbath never comes in&#xD;
robe so purely spiritual, with smile' so gladdening in&#xD;
all its soberness, and with steps so noiseless and&#xD;
angel-like, as when I see them "beautiful upon tke&#xD;
mountains.&#xD;

There were a score, at least, eh~ttiag together ~ X&#xD;

another, as my father passed. 'He ~return~d the greet~..&#xD;
ing in his hearty way, and enteredd the ~&#xD;
"Call father back, won't you, Lynde ?"said Griffith~.&#xD;
I did so.                                     -&#xD;
"Uncle George," said Thomas Thayer,. (1xe~ *as~ al~&#xD;
ways oaUed Squfre Thayer,. being a justice of ithe&#xD;
peace,) "we've been t4lkin' a little about Parson (~ray.&#xD;
son this morning."&#xD;
"What is it, Squire Thayer? Of course, y~w c~u't&#xD;

"No. I'd like to see the man ~ to do&#xD;

wintry~ air. His step was slow; 'his mien solemn,&#xD;
though not -sanctimonious; and his face was lit up by a&#xD;
~mile such- as the Christian alone can wear. He was&#xD;
accompanied byMrs. Grayson and Jessie.&#xD;
The kindly greetings over,. all entered the hQuse. As&#xD;
~f by magic,'the.low whisper, the shuffling of feet, and&#xD;
the rustle of dresses was hushed, and every eye was&#xD;
fixed upon the clergyman. He seezned utterly absorbed&#xD;
in the work of his calling ;',, unconscious of ~Very thing&#xD;
but the fact that he stood as a priest in the presence&#xD;
of th~ Grqat- High Priest, z'everently to 4o His -bidding&#xD;
and utter is. message to the people. A portion of&#xD;
Scripture was read. A prayer and a hymn followed.&#xD;
~IIe began very abruptly. "My -friends," said he,&#xD;
"there i~ a great want .of eltaritil in the world. 'We&#xD;

And with a long plank on his shoulder, Paul Warren&#xD;
came running towards us. He stopped a. little, way&#xD;

crawled to us. Grasping both of us, he drew us&#xD;

Paul made no reply; but I saw his bThck eye flash,&#xD;
his face grow pale, and h~s nether lip gathered between&#xD;
his teeth, in a 'way that betokened the strife of passion.&#xD;
"Why don't you go, sir ?" said my father, in a voice&#xD;
of thunder.&#xD;
12 4i4 not stir. For the first time in my recollection,&#xD;
I looked 'at him in his anger. I grew strangely calm&#xD;
and 'self-possessed, while I saw his herculean frame&#xD;
quivering with passion.&#xD;
"Won't you go, sir ?" said he, fiercely.&#xD;
"No! I won't go !" said I, stoutly; and I caught&#xD;

He raised the~whip' Quick as lightning, Paul War.&#xD;

his' breath hissed between hi~ clenched teeth,&#xD;
"No, sir! There shall be no flogging here, unless&#xD;
you flQg the boy' over a dead man's body. George&#xD;
Wei~s, stand back! or by"-&#xD;
My father' raised his brawny arm, (he had the&#xD;
strength of three common men,) and aimed a' blow at&#xD;
Paul Warren which might have felled an ox.&#xD;
'His' arm was caught from behind by the gentlemen&#xD;
who had left the table, and had silently witnessed the&#xD;
scene iii the office.&#xD;
"For shame, George' Weiss!" exclaimed the clergy-&#xD;

husky tone. They ~til1 held him.&#xD;
"W~6n't you? Then there with you !" and he hurled&#xD;
both to the floor.&#xD;
I had seldom seen my father in a passion-never in&#xD;
such a one as then mastered him. Whenever I had&#xD;
thus seen him, I observed that the moment he had&#xD;
struck a blow, or discovered that he had wounded the&#xD;
feelings of his antagonist, he was disarmed and' ready&#xD;
to beg forgiveness. It was so now. No sooner had he&#xD;
thrown the two men to the floor, than the revulsion&#xD;
took place, and, falling backward into a chair, he buried&#xD;
his face in his hands, and wept.&#xD;
"I~eave him to me,"' said Paul to Mr. Grayson and&#xD;
the squire; and they left the office. Fearful was the&#xD;
paroxysm of my father's grief. It was long before he'&#xD;
could regain his self-command.&#xD;
"Paul, my old friend, forgive in &amp;amp;!" said he, as he&#xD;
rose, at length, from his chair. "Lynde, my son,&#xD;
come here."&#xD;
I obeyed, and put my arms around his neck and&#xD;
wept.&#xD;
"Don't cry, my son," said he, gently. "You are a&#xD;

'BCHOOL-DAYS.---JONAH WIGGLES.WOR~H.-EXPERIMENTS.&#xD;
Trn~ naxt ~week I went to school. My. recollections&#xD;
'of those days are' ~f mingled pleasure and 'pain-~of&#xD;
ambition and hopeless serfdom-of the keenest delight&#xD;
arid of utter disgust. I confess, however, that i think&#xD;
the pictures" we' have, in' most of our modern 'por-&#xD;
traitures of'schoolmasters, ar~ unfavourably overdrawn,,&#xD;

&#xD;
49&#xD;
&#xD;
(and richly so) of all the chastisement I received. ~The&#xD;
faults of teachers then were the faults of the day.&#xD;
The rod was the great panacea. Children were sent&#xD;
to school (as they often are now-a-days) to get them&#xD;
out of the. way. That is to say, the teacher was paid&#xD;
a beggarly pittance to do what the parents were too&#xD;
lazy, or stupid, or weak, to do themselves-.--to govern&#xD;
the child--to produce a hundred-fold, not only in 'the&#xD;
good ground, but in the thorns, upon the rock, and&#xD;
by the wayside. He was valued as the ass is valued-&#xD;
for his capability of endurance of hardship and toil,&#xD;
and his* (unthanked) fidelity beyond other animals. of&#xD;
his class; and they who were never in good-humour at&#xD;
home were those to whom a moment's irritability, pro-&#xD;
voked by nastiness, 'stupidity, laziness, or mulish obsti-&#xD;
nacy, was the unpardonable sin.&#xD;
But to my story. Mr. Wigglesworth was the anti..&#xD;
podes of all I had been expecting in the person of the&#xD;
new schoolmaster. He was a short, squatty, and some-&#xD;
what corpulent man, from Vermont. The wrinkles&#xD;
about his eyes were eloquent of fun, and the more so&#xD;
by contrast with his assumed gravity. His learning&#xD;
was confined within exceedingly narrow limits. Not&#xD;
so his vanity;~ but this last was so good~humoured a&#xD;
feature in him, as to be very pardonable. ' He wore a&#xD;
very wide-brimmed hat, underneath which he wore his&#xD;
hair brushed up fiercely 'on end. He wore green spec-&#xD;
tacles, too; and used a huge, queer-looking cane, with&#xD;
a 'fox's head carved on the handle. I never 'saw him&#xD;
save in one dress, winter or summer, the same being&#xD;
about the rustiest, most antiquated and dilapidated&#xD;
structure of'cloth and stitches which 'it has been my lot&#xD;
to behold in this '"vale of tears." His trousers~ barely&#xD;
reached the tops of a pail' of cow-hide boots, which&#xD;
might have served as pontoons for the ferriage, of&#xD;
ordnance, and which were only allowable in a new&#xD;
country, with a sparse population, where land is not&#xD;
sold by the square foot. They (the trousers) were of'&#xD;
a rusty, brownish yellow. The "nap" was worn off&#xD;

and a perceptible gloss pervaded the 'principal points&#xD;
of exposure.&#xD;
His coat was of light blue, with well-worn brass but-&#xD;
tons, and of the cut yclept "swallow-tail," with a, collar&#xD;
reaching up to the philoprogenitive organ of his .cra~-&#xD;
nium. A white neckcloth, and a collar that seemed&#xD;
to be doing outpost duty, as a supporter of his ears,&#xD;
threw his round, . full-moon-like, rubicund visage into&#xD;
full relief.&#xD;
Some two or three. score of us 'were assembled when&#xD;
he came. He walked directly to the desk, (it did ser-&#xD;
vice as a pulpit on the Sabbath,) without the slightest&#xD;
greeting. There arrived, he commenced operations by&#xD;
taking a huge old-fashioned watch (whose weight was&#xD;
'I'    little more than sufficient to prevent the massive chain&#xD;
and superabundance of seals from hauling it out from&#xD;
the fob) and hanging it on a nail.' His coat was simi-&#xD;
larly disposed of; and when* he had brushed his hair&#xD;
yet more stiffly on end, his keen, shrill, nose-twanged&#xD;
tones rose high above the urcl~in-din, in the abrupt&#xD;
order-&#xD;
"There, naow! git yer seats, all on ye! I'm gem'&#xD;
fur to read the rewis !"&#xD;
He read them, and proceeded to read &amp;amp; chapter from&#xD;
the ]3ible. Then the classes were formed. It came&#xD;
my turn to read.&#xD;
F&#xD;
"Who are yaou ?"&#xD;
"My name's Jynde Weiss."&#xD;
"Git aout! I never heerd such a name. What's&#xD;
the first name, d'you say ?"&#xD;
"Lynde."&#xD;
"Wal, I trust you'll get yer cranium' . lined this&#xD;
winter ?" and he looked up to see if anybody perceived&#xD;
the pun. "Never heerd t'other name either, as I&#xD;
knows on. Anyhow, it's a darned queer 'un. Hold&#xD;
up yer head, and read aout-LoUD !"&#xD;
I got through' the first day nicely; but the days&#xD;
were few, during, that. long winter, in which I did not&#xD;
somehow provoke his ire. "I declare tew man !" was&#xD;
&#xD;
his favourite expletive when irritated, and no one called&#xD;
it forth oftener than I. I learned easily, and therefore&#xD;
deferred learning my tasks until the latest moment.&#xD;
There was a row of urchins on the same seat with me,&#xD;
and tired (oh! how tifed I used to get on those. Strait-&#xD;
backed, deal benches!) of sitting so long, we would&#xD;
either imitate the Irish in&#xD;
"Fighting for conciliation,"&#xD;
or else contrive to get into a general titter of laughter.&#xD;
Once excited, my risible muscles were beyond my con-&#xD;
trol, and I laughed even under the whip.&#xD;
"I declare tew man !" said Mr. Wiggleswortb, (his&#xD;
praenomen was Jonah, but he always wrote his name&#xD;
J. Wigglesworth,) "them 'ere boys pester me tew death.&#xD;
I sat,', there! yaoz&amp;amp;! LYNDE! c'm 'ere to me&#xD;
He would then ply his whip with praiseworthy vigour,&#xD;
breathing, meanwhile, with an' asthmatic wheeze, until&#xD;
his wrath 'was appeased. I grew careless of the rod&#xD;
and his admonitions, and bethought me of some plan of&#xD;
revenge. With two or three other urchins, equally the&#xD;
victims of his occasional ire, (he'always tried persuasion&#xD;
and ghostly counsel before resorting to the whip,) I&#xD;
finally matured a plan, which I considered not only very&#xD;
ingenious, but highly original. I was familiar' with the&#xD;
plan of sticking pins in the bench on which he sat-of&#xD;
putting a brick in his coat-pocket as it liung against&#xD;
the wall, while his attention was absorbed by a "sum"----&#xD;
of pinning papers to its skirt when it was on him-and&#xD;
other similar plans of annoyance.' I now flattered&#xD;
myself, however, that I had concocted a scheme which&#xD;
would amuse the school and defy detection.&#xD;
Accordingly I prepared, with the. assistance of ~&#xD;
blacksmith, a thin piece of iron, with holes for nails, to&#xD;
serve as a spring, and bent it perhaps an inch out of&#xD;
the horizontal line. This I nailed beneath the' bench&#xD;
where he usually ,sat. I then bored a very small hole,&#xD;
through which I passed a large darning-needle, and&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="52" xml:id="VAC8062-00000028"/>&#xD;
LThD1~ WEISS.&#xD;
&#xD;
tied the needle to the spring by passing a stout thread&#xD;
through the eye of the needle and around the spring.&#xD;
To the same spring I tied a bit of small cord, and&#xD;
passed it through a hole in the floor. I then went out-&#xD;
~icle the school-house, an~ passed the string up through&#xD;
~, l~ole izk the floor, (bored to let the water off when the&#xD;
hon~se was scrubbed,) near my usual seat. There were&#xD;
other similar holes in different parts of the house.&#xD;
At length my plan was matured, and every thing&#xD;
was in readiness. I never, shall forget the day and the&#xD;
~cene. It was a dark, rainy, foggy, disagreeable morn-&#xD;
ing, during the "January thaw." Jonah was mani-&#xD;
festly in the doldrums. He came in with a very digni-&#xD;
fled air and took his seat. He looked around with an.&#xD;
ominous scowl that had wellnigh frightened me from&#xD;
my purpose. I put on my demurest look, however,&#xD;
and awaited my opportunity. It came. He opened&#xD;
the Bible at a chapter in the Old Testament, and I re-&#xD;
member that he had just read the words, "All flesh is&#xD;
grass," in his deepest twang and most drawling tone,&#xD;
when, s~tadente diabolo, I gave the string ~t most&#xD;
vigorous pull, and let it go.&#xD;
~" On 1" shouted, or rather roared, Mr. Wigglesworth&#xD;
he dropped the Bible and sprang "high in air,"&#xD;
after the manner of an Indian chief in a war-dance.&#xD;
"On! Murder! dod ding it all tew dingnation! Who&#xD;
done that 'ere ~"&#xD;
The school now burst into one general roar of laugh-&#xD;
ter, de profundis, loud, long, irrepressible. Jonah's&#xD;
face crimsoned with rage as he looked beneath the&#xD;
bench and saw the spring. His rage mastered his cau-&#xD;
tion. lie pulled the string, as I expected he would,&#xD;
through the hole, and, of course, lost all clue to the&#xD;
.offender. The chapter w~s not finished that morning.&#xD;
~Uhe story got abroad, and Jonah Wigglesworth de~&#xD;
camped to the more congenial atmosphere of the Green&#xD;
Mountains.&#xD;
In reviewing the scenes of my school-days, IL look,&#xD;
with a regret which I have no words to express, on the&#xD;

folly, and worse than folly, of which I was guilty, in&#xD;
thus adding to the cares and' perplexities of the most&#xD;
harassing toil beneath the sun. I would that I could&#xD;
recall them, or, if that be impossible, that -I could see&#xD;
the men who were disposed to be kind to me, and&#xD;
would have been so but for my waywardness and folly;&#xD;
nay, who were kind to me, and patient with me, despite&#xD;
my faults and misconduct. When I think of the toil&#xD;
and care-the fault-finding of patrons whom nothing&#xD;
can please-the hopelessness of fame or distinctiori'-~.-&#xD;
the grudgingly-given, pitiful stipend of his toib-the&#xD;
Want of all sympathy for, the teacher's trials, and a&#xD;
thoii~nd other desagr.~1mens of the profession, (if I may&#xD;
so d~nify it,) which experience has revealed to me, IL&#xD;
may be pardoned, for saying that I so deeply regret&#xD;
those errors and follies of m~r school-days.&#xD;
As I ma.y not have occasion to refer to Mr. Wiggles~&#xD;
worth agaixk3 may not b~ amiss to say ~tbM I saw him&#xD;
a year or two since, during a trip from Burlington to the&#xD;
Notch of the White Mountains, lie 'had married soon&#xD;

children. I confessed md received absolution for xn~y&#xD;
practical experiment on the elasticity of iron; and he&#xD;
told the story, laughing till the, tears ran down his&#xD;
cheeks, to his wife.&#xD;
"Yaou was rather a frisky chap, I guess, in them&#xD;

WE exchanged King Log for King Stork. The suc-&#xD;
cessor~ of Jonah Wiggresworth was a genuine Tartar. I&#xD;
received :a severe flogging the first day, and- something&#xD;
like a score of my conipeers received a. similar earnest&#xD;
of 'the policy of the new administration. I was pretty&#xD;
thoroughly got into harness by his lynx-eyed vigilance&#xD;
and uncompromising exactions. Months rolled away.&#xD;
Years passed. Political excitement made its way even&#xD;
to the quiet viU~ge of Boylsfon. The State was tossed&#xD;
on the billows of faction in the mimic war of the Olin-&#xD;
tonion's and Bucktails. My father took a warm interest&#xD;
in politics, and 'was elected to the. Legislature, or As-&#xD;
sembly, as the New Yorkers are wont to call it. Sub-&#xD;
seqviently .hewas s~ent to Congress as a member of the&#xD;
lower h6use, and gave, as. far as I can learn, very&#xD;
general satisfaction to his constituents.'&#xD;
In the meantime, I had left the district-school for the&#xD;
academy,~ or perhaps F should. say boarding-school, as&#xD;
the institution combined, more of the features of that&#xD;
class of schools. The Reverend . Theophilus Winter&#xD;
was my instructor. He was a most worthy man. He&#xD;
was of exceedingly small stature-neat, precise, and of&#xD;
a heart that overbalanced his head; for, ~like most stu-&#xD;
dents, he was no financier9 Ii shall never forget 'the&#xD;
careworn expression that met my eye when I first saw&#xD;
him. The exercises of the school had already com-&#xD;
menced. He was' surrounded by about forty pupils,&#xD;
from the age of eight to twenty; and all were in a&#xD;
small, low,, hot, unventilated room. Lie was initiating&#xD;
a class into the mysteries of Fisk's Adams's Latin&#xD;
&#xD;
Grammar. I stood sadly embartassed, while my Uncle&#xD;
Hugh (who superintended my father's business while&#xD;
he was absent) made the necessary arrangements. It&#xD;
required all my firmness-and I could muster a deal of&#xD;
it in an emergency-.~-.to prevent my eyes from telling&#xD;
tales of me when my uncle left me amGng that throng&#xD;
of strange faces. I found it impossible to' study. The&#xD;
keen, piercing, yet kindly eye of the teacher met mine&#xD;
occasionally, as I looked around on the group of faces;&#xD;
and the furrows on his ample forehead, worn there by&#xD;
the toil and cares of years, won for him my ready and&#xD;
hearty sympathy. I became attached to him.&#xD;
The first and most striking contrast I noticed be-&#xD;
tween my old and n~w home was in the meagre fare-~&#xD;
the apology for tea and coffee-the quantity of butter,&#xD;
(greater than nothing by "no assignable difference,")..&#xD;
and usually rancid, and the scanty allotment Qf other&#xD;
palatable food. This, let me say at once, was not pro-.&#xD;
perly chargeable to Mr. Winter, for his terms were so.~&#xD;
very low, that to have furnished us good food, in proper&#xD;
quantity and variety, Would have more than; exhausted&#xD;
his scanty revenues.&#xD;
I soon made acquaintances,. All my preyions siiffer.~,&#xD;
ings under the rod had' not yet taught me seWgQv~rIi.~&#xD;
ment, and my pranks began to attract the attention of&#xD;
Mr. Winter. J was astounded on~ morning by an,&#xD;
abrupt summons to. go forward to his desk.&#xD;
"Was it you who put'. the asa~foetida on Mr. Clay.~&#xD;
bank's (~he usher's) stove ?" said he, with ~some 8terfl-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
"No, sir.&#xD;

"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Well, Master I~ynde Weiss, permit me to say to&#xD;
you, that I've heard of your pranks before, and that if&#xD;
you do not alter your course, you will be' dismissed&#xD;
from this institution."&#xD;
This public reprimand was of some temporary ser~&#xD;
vice. I was~ for a' time a model of hard study, and of&#xD;
the profoundest and most respectful deference to beth&#xD;
the' excellent clergyman and his somewhat unamiable&#xD;
usher.&#xD;
It was at this school that I became acquainted with&#xD;
0eYeral boys ~ho were subsequently my classmates in&#xD;
co1leg~. There were two with whom I was more espe~&#xD;
~ially in1~imate. One of them was a son of Mr. David&#xD;
Fogg'; of the firm of'Fogg &amp;amp; Gibson,. with whom I was&#xD;
already acquainted; the other, a son of~ a clergyman&#xD;
settled in'a village some thirty-five miles from Boylston.&#xD;
B~rney Fogg wa~ the'most studious of all the pupils at&#xD;
th~ Allenville Academy. He was my antipodes in&#xD;
almost every thing..&#xD;
"Barney," I would say to him sometimes, "let's go&#xD;
and have a skate on the' lake" (Allenville was on the&#xD;
1ake~shore.)&#xD;
"I can't."'&#xD;
~"Why, B~rney ?"&#xD;
"I've a Greek lesson to get," and without further&#xD;
reply, he would mutter in a bee-hive, treadmill-like&#xD;
monotone, "Thyto, t~pteis, tuptei I"&#xD;
Oh, hang the~ Greek, Barney! LeV~s have a. skate.".&#xD;

I did not usually wait beyond the declension of the&#xD;
optative mood; and while I left him, vexed at hi~&#xD;
dogged, indefatigable, humdrum devotions to the&#xD;
Greek divinities, he was as unruffled as the surface of&#xD;
his favourite lake among the mountains. Despite all&#xD;
our diversity of habits and tastes, we were (as indeed&#xD;
were Mr. Fogg and my father) fast friends. I had&#xD;
come opportunely to hi8 assistance ~ne day, when two&#xD;
large boys were endeavouring to beat him; and he bad,&#xD;
on one occasion, pulled me, halfdrowned,. from a rift&#xD;
in the ice.&#xD;
Jar~ies Allen was a somewhat more congenial spirit.&#xD;
We were chums and classmates. He was a small, thin,&#xD;
frail, but very intellectual lad, whose moral and intel-&#xD;
lectual nature had an undisputed sway over the animal.&#xD;
With me, the two , principles were in almost ceaseless&#xD;
warfare. I envied him his quietness and self~control.&#xD;
They seemed inborn. On his part, he became very&#xD;
warmly attached to me, in spite of my 'i4yward freaks&#xD;
and uxiaccountable moods; and we built many a scom&#xD;
of those airy chateaux which, by all' accounts, must&#xD;
cover yery nearly the whole of the broad lands of Gas-&#xD;
tile and Arragon. We kept journals. We walked and&#xD;
rode together, and he used to go home with me at vaca~&#xD;
tions. We were almost constantly together. His habits&#xD;
of study, however, were of a cast far better~ than mine.&#xD;
His lessons were learned uniformly well, and he studied&#xD;
the prescribed number of hours. I, on the contrary,&#xD;
studied intensely and with scarcely any exercise or re-,&#xD;
laxation, (sometimes without regularly going to my&#xD;
meals,) for days in succession, and then I did nothing&#xD;
worth mentioning for a we&amp;amp;k. He waxed pale and thin&#xD;
with study and confinement, and was troubled with a&#xD;
cough in winter time that gave his friends mitch un-&#xD;
easines&amp;amp;; while my active habits made me more robust.&#xD;
The memory of my reprimand wore gradually away,&#xD;
and my appetite for mischief returned. Several small&#xD;
offences were insufficient to stake Mr. ~Winter's confi-&#xD;

pupils came in one morning, and I was billeted upon&#xD;
Mr Olaybank. There were two beds in the room. The&#xD;
usher was a very prim, fastidious sort of man. An&#xD;
offensive smell, an unusual bustle, a mistake in a&#xD;
lesson, a. soiled hand, or a rumpled collar, were his&#xD;
litter abomination. Nervous, irritable, whimsical, he&#xD;
was my favourite subject of experiment. Many a jere-&#xD;
mniad did the chambermaid listen tQ, in consequence of&#xD;
divers unsightly stains upon his pillow; constant re-&#xD;
movals of his books (it fretted him to have a book or a.&#xD;
pen, even his paper-cutter, removed) from the position&#xD;
which it was his wish that they should occupy, and&#xD;
other ~imila.r annoyances. Pins were found in his&#xD;
sheets. His razor escaped, now and then, from the&#xD;
ease. The chambermaid protested (as well she might)&#xD;
her entire innocence.&#xD;
"Is it me ye mane, Misther Claybat"-&#xD;
"Mr. Olaybank-~--Claybank is my name, Margaret."&#xD;
"Claybank ~thin, or Clayshank-it's the same to&#xD;
nie-av ye lay the bla'gard t;b7icks to me!"&#xD;
"Well, but who does them, if you don't ?"&#xD;
"Och! botherashin! Don't be after accusing' a poor&#xD;
lone woman as niver dhramed of doing the laste taste&#xD;
in life o' mischief till anybody in the world."&#xD;
And with the air of injured innocence she would&#xD;
stalk out o~f the room with a swing "aiqual to the&#xD;
queen." I suggested that the boy Tim, who made~ our&#xD;
fires, might be die offender. Mr. Claybank called Tim&#xD;
and questioned him. Tim lifted his hands in mute&#xD;
astonishment.&#xD;
"Did I lift the books, is it, Misther Claybank ?"&#xD;
Yes, -Tim, that's the question I asked you. Here&#xD;
are my ~books all bottom-side up. My pen ~s two&#xD;
inches deep in the ink, and I am certain that I left the&#xD;
inkstan&amp;amp; corked; for. the ink evaporates so, and. gets&#xD;
thick when it's exposed to. the air. Did you move my&#xD;
books?"&#xD;
"AV coorse I didn't, Misther Claybank. 1"-&#xD;

"That will do, Tim; you may go.. Who can it be,&#xD;
Lynde?"&#xD;
"Sure enough," said I.&#xD;
"Of course, Lynde, you wouldn't. annoy me in this&#xD;
way?"&#xD;
"ME, sir?"&#xD;
"No, it couldn't be you. Forgive me! But, really,&#xD;
this is too bad. There was a kind of powder on the&#xD;
pillow-case last night that kept me sneezing till two&#xD;
o'clock."&#xD;
"What could it have been ?" said I, demurely.&#xD;
"The Lord knows! There's a kind of snuff, I be~&#xD;
lieve, which sometimes has that effect. And besides,&#xD;
now I think of it, do you use tobacco, Lynde ?"&#xD;
'1&#xD;
"No, sir.&#xD;
"So I supposed. But there has been a strong smell&#xD;
of tobacco about the room to-day; and if there is a&#xD;
thing I do detest more than any ether, it is that nasty&#xD;
weed."&#xD;
Mi'. Olaybank's olfactories did not deceive him.&#xD;
Knowing his aversion to the weed, I. had bought a-.&#xD;
pound of fine-cut tobacco, and sprinkled it plentifully&#xD;
under the cloth that covered his table. He kept sniff-&#xD;
ing at intervals, with every sign of extreme irritability.&#xD;
"Don't you smell it, Lynde ?"&#xD;
lTThat, sir?"&#xD;
"Why, the nasty tobacco4~&#xD;
"Yes, sir," said I, also sniffing, "I think I do smell&#xD;
something like tobacco.&#xD;
Mr. Claybank retired early that night, leaving the&#xD;
window a little way open. Not content with what ii&#xD;
had done, I now devised a new and more terrible an-.&#xD;
noyance. The little table at which I sat in Mr. Clay-&#xD;
bank's apartment was near the window. In one of the.&#xD;
lower ~panes &amp;amp; small liole~ had. been broken, which Mr~&#xD;
Winter had been promising to repair, b~xt which he con-&#xD;

and school. The window was~ directly beneath a semi4~&#xD;

was a broken pane. The stove-funnel went through an&#xD;
aperture in the ceiling considerably larger thaii the&#xD;
funnel.&#xD;
When Mr. Claybank had fallen into a sound sleep, I&#xD;
cautiously opened my trunk and took out the " paper.&#xD;
of tobacco. I then left 'the room, and ascended the&#xD;
stairs to the attic. Taking a piece of board, I covered&#xD;
it with tobacco, and raised it to so sharp an angle of&#xD;
inclination, that a very' slight movement would be sufli-&#xD;
cient to send a portion of the tobacco 'down through&#xD;
the aperture in the ceiling directly upon the stove. I&#xD;
then tied a thread to the board, passed it out of the&#xD;
window in 'the gable, and, going to Mr. Claybank's&#xD;
room, I hauled it in.&#xD;
He had not 'been asleep more than an hour when he&#xD;
woke with. a violent colic. My organ of benevolence&#xD;
(phrenologically speaking)' was excited. I ran down&#xD;
stairs *for the peppermint, and had 'the pleasure to dis-&#xD;
cover that it gave him almost immediate relief.&#xD;
"You're a goodhoy, Lynde," said Mr. Claybank. I&#xD;
winced. "Yott were '~rather naughty, though, when&#xD;
you first came here, and I'm. sure there's no one who&#xD;
more sincerely rejoices 'to see the improvement in you&#xD;
than I. I feel as if I could go to sleep again now.&#xD;
Good night, Lynde."&#xD;
"Good night, Mr. Claybank."&#xD;
"A'n't you going to bed'?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir; I'm on my last lesson now.&#xD;
I blew out the light, and 'lengthening the string so&#xD;
that I could take it into bed with me, I was preparing&#xD;
to retire When Mr. Claybank startled me by saying,&#xD;
rather abruptly,&#xD;
"I say, Lynde, hadn't you better bury the fire in&#xD;
the stove with the ashes? It's' confounded hot here.&#xD;
Cover it up, Won't you, Lynde, there's a good boy ?"&#xD;

go down 'and see. Where in the woi~ld is my dressing~&#xD;
gown? That stupid chambermaid eternally moves it&#xD;
out of the place where I invariably hang it."&#xD;
Mr. ~Jlaybank now went down stairs.. I got out of&#xD;
bed, and broke the string '.nea~'~ the window. I then'-&#xD;
blew the tobaeoo off the stove, 'and got into bed.&#xD;
"WeW if this ~'n't strange 1" said the usher, on his&#xD;

With a chapter of such incoherent mutterings, Mr.&#xD;
Claybank talked himself asleep, while I lay with the&#xD;

covered the board, and the tobacco, and the string;&#xD;

reaching precisely to the hole in my window. The&#xD;

WHEN I got home, my uncle Hugh talked with me&#xD;
very seriously about my dismissal from school, and&#xD;
gave me a great deal of good advice.&#xD;
"These are golden hours, Lynde, as you will see by~&#xD;

"Certainly, uncle, with pleasure;" and~ 1' left the&#xD;

in a day or two afterward, I was placed under. the care&#xD;
of Chester Phillips, A. M., in the pretty village of MU-&#xD;

portions. He was a benevolent, large-hearted ~old gen~&#xD;
tleman, full~ of good-hwxmour, and possessing, with an&#xD;
inexhaustible fund of anecdotes, the very bigheei~ skill&#xD;

and tact as a narrator. Simple he was as achuld;&#xD;
and we all loved him. He had the rare power of adapt-&#xD;
in g his manner to the tastes and humours of those with&#xD;
whom he associated. He was as dear to the light-&#xD;
hearted, gay, frol~cseme Lucy, as to her graver, and&#xD;
more thQughtfui sister. No one could so convulse, my&#xD;
father with long, loud, boisterous laughter; and while&#xD;
the housekeeper declared he was a "fusty old fellow,"&#xD;
she would suffer nobody to take the charge of his room,&#xD;
or his wardrobe, except under ~her direct supervision.&#xD;
He had a way, too~, of teasing my aunt Caroline about&#xD;
some love-affairs of her younger days, that rendered&#xD;
him quite as much a favourite with her.&#xD;
I studied hard at Milton. I remained there two&#xD;
years; and not once did I receive a 'harsh word or 'an&#xD;
unkind look. With what pride did II 'give to my father&#xD;
Mr. Phillips's letter of warm commendation, 'in which he.&#xD;
announced that Ii was now prepared to present myself&#xD;
for examination, preparatory to entering college! I&#xD;
returned home in' time to spend 'my seventeenth birth-&#xD;
day. By invitation, Paul Warren, his wife and chil-&#xD;
dren, and the good clergyman, with Mrs. Grayson~ and&#xD;
Jessie, spent the day with us. I was now well-grown;&#xD;
perhaps somewhat overgrown for my age; and Mary&#xD;
Warren flattered me not a little by saying,&#xD;
"I'm proud of you,' Jaynde. You're getting to be a&#xD;
man, almost. ,Will you forget your mother Warren,&#xD;
when you comes back' from college a learned man&#xD;
"~Forget you, mother ?" exclaimed I~ (I do n6t know&#xD;

live.. You have 'been more than a mother to me, if that&#xD;
is possible; and may God bless you for all your kindi~&#xD;

She turned her head hastily away and walked to the&#xD;
window, as I spoke with more than my 'usuaL earnest-&#xD;

Jessie, for some' reason or other, seemed constrained&#xD;

And now that I, had returned, not a little proud of the&#xD;
honours I had won at the academy, she was the only&#xD;
one whose face did not respond to the general emotion&#xD;
of pleasure. ' She hung~ her head, too; bashfully,&#xD;
almost; and I had always known her to be remarkably&#xD;
frank, easy, and self-possessed. I iwas. puzzled. More&#xD;
than that, I was annoyed. I assumed a dignified air;&#xD;
and when Mr. Grayson sand his lady left us, I suffered&#xD;
Jessie to go home without other attendance.&#xD;
FrQm being vexed with her, I now grew vexed with&#xD;
myself." I had never before suffered her to' go home&#xD;
from my~father's house without going with her. Then&#xD;
I tried to laugh at myself, and asked myself aloud,&#xD;
"What if she is vexed? What is Jessie' Grayson to&#xD;
you? Besides, didn't you see' her riding with Frank&#xD;
Gibson, yesterday? llumph I"&#xD;
I took my gun, and, calling Munch, who stood eyein~'&#xD;
me and wagging his tail during my brief soliloquy,&#xD;
strode away to the woods.&#xD;
I love the woods. Well saith Bryant,&#xD;
"To him who, in the love of nature, holds&#xD;
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks&#xD;
A various language."&#xD;
Even so. I spent the earliest years of my life in the&#xD;
woods. I have sought their still recesses in the h~ur&#xD;
of joy;' and the grim old oaks' and pines seemed to me&#xD;
to' be conscious of my ii~puJses.. Their leaves Seemed&#xD;
to rustle more gleefully in the breeze as I looked aloft&#xD;
through their giant branches. I have gone there in&#xD;
sadness; and in the quietness of the scene, Qnly. broken&#xD;
by the low wail of the wind 'through the tops of the&#xD;
waving pines, peace ~arjne to my troubled spirit.~ I have&#xD;
made me. a couch in the woods; of their evergreen&#xD;
boughs; and while I sank travel-worn, penniless, weary,&#xD;

stealing away from'&#xD;
-"The throng, to haunts untrod,&#xD;
To hold communion there with God ;"&#xD;
and the calm of the forest fell upon me. I tro4 its&#xD;
aisles with uncovered head, in humble reverence. I&#xD;
was not alone. There was 'around me* a Presence, like&#xD;
that which passed before the face of the' patriarch,. "in&#xD;

was hushed; the billows sunk to rest; the day-star of&#xD;
hope twinkled above the hills; and there dawned upon&#xD;
the tempest~strained spirit the light of peace.&#xD;
I did not shoot any thing that afternoon. It hap-&#xD;
pened, somehow, that I wandered in the direction of&#xD;
Mr. Grayson's, instead of~ returning directly home.&#xD;
Directly in the' rear of his house, and but a 'few rods&#xD;
distant, was a hill which was generally called "The&#xD;
Ledge." It extended nearly, or quite, a furlong along&#xD;
the eastern bank of the Bouquet, and from its summit&#xD;
you could see the entire village. As I emerged from&#xD;
the wood8, the gleam of a white dress caught my eye,&#xD;
and a few steps brought me in full view 'of the wearer.&#xD;
I was within a very few yards of her before she saw&#xD;
inc&#xD;
"How you frightened me, Lynde I" said Jessie, for&#xD;
it was she. She had' called me Mr. Weiss at home.&#xD;
"Please to cut me a branch of' this wild rose-bush."&#xD;
"With pleasure. Any serviOe that I render Miss&#xD;
Grayson"'-'&#xD;
"Lynde!"&#xD;
"Forgive me, Jessie! You were so distant at our&#xD;
'house, that I was alrnost vexed with you. Mu IL for-&#xD;
gi~en, Jessie?" I 'added, 'taking her ~small,~ white band&#xD;
in mine. There was a tear glistening on her long, dark&#xD;
eyelashes-.' "Tell me I am forgiven, Jessie. 'I leave&#xD;
you to-~rnorroW, and I'~ don't know when I shall see you&#xD;
"again;' I can't' beat to be at odds with you, for. ever&#xD;

since that terrible time on the ice, and all the time I&#xD;
have been away at school, there has been no day~-no,&#xD;
nor hour, that I haven't thought of"-.&#xD;
"Here she is now-the runaway I" exclaimed Mr.&#xD;
Grayson, as he came around a clump of pines, in full&#xD;
view of us. "Ali! J~ynde, my boy! you're just in&#xD;
time, (and so are ~,'ou, thought I;) come and .take tea&#xD;
with us."&#xD;
And, chatting good4iumouredly, he led the way to&#xD;
the house. The evening did not wear away a~ plea-&#xD;
santly as I had hoped. Mrs. Grayson; .1' thought,&#xD;
looked as if something oppressed her spirits. I thought,&#xD;
too, (it might have been an idle fancy,) that Mr. Gray-&#xD;
son's face seemed flushed, and it struck me that there&#xD;
was something very like harshness in some of his re-&#xD;
plies to Mrs. Grayson and her daughter.&#xD;
I took leave of them at an early hour. I had no op-&#xD;
portunity to speak with Jessie. I caught her eye as I&#xD;
bade them good~night, 'and there was an expression in&#xD;
it of mingled tenderness and uncertainty, and sadness,&#xD;

'C9LLEo13~ days! How mighty a throng of pleasant&#xD;
memories rise up, waxing distinct and palpable, from&#xD;
the mistiness of years gone by, like the genii of the&#xD;
Arabian ights' Entertainments; summoned sturdily&#xD;

reckoning. Where was I? A brief "tour of inspec-&#xD;

collection that I ~was in the .third story of the Anglo-&#xD;
Saxon Hotel. I had inquired of one of the passengers&#xD;
in the stage-coach, the day before, for the best hotel&#xD;
in Clinton; and he was pleased to say that hp had&#xD;
"put up" at both the United states and the Massasoit,&#xD;

had been talking about preparing tq~ ~enter~ the sophQ-&#xD;

pressioii that he would remain another year with Mr.&#xD;
Winter.&#xD;
Having ascertained, to my entire satisfaetio ~i, where&#xD;
I was, I proceeded to dress. This, I have sin ~e ~arn-&#xD;
ed, was a very improper step. Nothing 'so lowers: you&#xD;
in the estimation of the chamber-maids and porters as&#xD;
to rise before ~six o'clock when days are at the longest.&#xD;
The Brummel-like coloured-boy; who had taken off'his&#xD;

"Waiter!"&#xD;
"Come here!"&#xD;
I was a little vexed 'to see the boy, negro4ike; at-&#xD;
tending ~first to the last-received commission, and I&#xD;
went to the door to remonstrate. I was on the point&#xD;

I've had. You didn't expect to see me here, eh? I&#xD;
changed my mind. Talked 'it all over with the old&#xD;
man, (his father,) and concluded to enter this session.&#xD;
You were at Milton when I was at home. Would ~iave&#xD;
written to you, but you didn't answer my last' three&#xD;
letters. Took it rather unkind of you. Not exactly&#xD;
neighborly, oh? Had a fine time at home. What a&#xD;
splendid girl Jessie Grayson's got to be. Waiter! you&#xD;
nee~i't wait. I want to have a little talk with my&#xD;
friend Weiss. Speaking of Jessie"-&#xD;
"I believe I must ask you. to excuse. me, Barney. I&#xD;
am going 'out. I have"-'&#xD;
"Wal, I'll go with you, in half a minute. Do you&#xD;

"Well, I'm all, ready 'but this plague boot. There!&#xD;

We.(for I couldn't get rid of Barney) walked for an&#xD;
hour about the streets of Clinton. We went to the&#xD;
college-buildings..' There was, here and there, an open&#xD;
window, with the head of some inatutinal student just&#xD;
visible.' With what awe did 1 gage on the walls of the&#xD;
edifice-the features of ~my future Alma Mater. To&#xD;
my inexperienced eye they were not very promising-&#xD;
a plain physiognomy, whose hard brickba1~d~mortar ex-&#xD;
pression would puzzle wiser disciples of Lavater th~rn I.&#xD;
The' very trees that stood, sentry-like1 in front of it,&#xD;
had somehow a presence that the sacred groves are said&#xD;
tG' have luid for the half~religious Greek. There was&#xD;
something awe-inspiring in the very stillness that&#xD;
reigned' around. A pale, emaciated student passed. us&#xD;
witho huge 'book under his arm. He was apparently&#xD;
unconscious; of our presence, and, as if a spirit had&#xD;
passed~before my face, I stood in silent, solemn, spirit&#xD;
absorbing awe.'. The plain unornamented walls-the&#xD;
tin~cover~d dome-the vacant hails-the weird4iko&#xD;

LYI~DE WEISS.                71&#xD;

vals, appeared and v~riished'! Even&#xD;

"May Ibe bold&#xD;

"D'you spose we'll ever get through ?" said Barney,&#xD;
in a wJ~isper, as we left the buildings.&#xD;
It was about ten o'clock that 'morning 'that I f6und&#xD;
myself, with' Barney, James Allen, and two or 'three&#xD;
other candidates for admission, in the study of Pro-&#xD;

have gone there to ask a revelation of the future, with&#xD;
more pulse~arresting terror; and, to all appearance, my&#xD;
companions were scarcely more at~.ease. The examine~,&#xD;
tion began, and the first glance and tone of the kincb&#xD;
hearted, simple professor' banished my fears. I drew&#xD;
a long breath in sensible relief. A few questions ~to&#xD;
our preparatory course'of study, and we' were informed&#xD;
that our examination was over, and that we~ Were ad*&#xD;

THOMAS BROWN.-.THE WARNING.&#xD;
I STUDIJIID hard the first year. As I advanced, I&#xD;
found my mathematical studies growing difficult and&#xD;
irksome. Our professor of mathematics was reputed a&#xD;
profound scholar-~justly so, I have no doubt. lie had&#xD;
not, however, (meipso judice,) the art of explaining&#xD;
well. I went to him one day for assistance, lie took&#xD;
the book, (Calculus, or Conic Sections,) and looking&#xD;
for a moment at the page, began straitway a harangue.&#xD;
of some ten~ minutes' duration, in which a tornado of&#xD;
technicalities poured restlessly forth for. my admiring&#xD;
ears. Choctaw, Patagonian, Nukahivan, i~eejee, hea.,&#xD;
then Greek was it all to me~&#xD;
"You understand it all now, don't you, Weiss ?"&#xD;
"Not quite, sir!"&#xD;
"Huzuph!."&#xD;
lie began again. Shades of the patriarchs a~d&#xD;
prophets! what a second Nile-like overflow!&#xD;
"Now you see it, don't you,, Weiss ?."&#xD;

~T4.              LYNDE WEISS.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, perfectly," said I, and left the recitation-&#xD;
room ii~ utter fog, mystification, confusion, irritation-&#xD;
disgust.&#xD;
I grew heedless. I was reprimanded.&#xD;
"Weiss, haven't you got this lesson ?" was the re-&#xD;
gular query, and "No, sir," was quite as uniformly&#xD;
the reply.&#xD;
"What's an ellipse ?" said he, one day, after pro-&#xD;
pounding several' other questions.&#xD;
"An ellipse, sir?"&#xD;
"Yes, ~in ellipse."'&#xD;
"Why, sir," I replied, scarcely thinking what I said,&#xD;
the most important feature, appears to me that it is&#xD;
very much like a goose-egg; and that whereas circles&#xD;
have but one centre, ellipses have two !"&#xD;
A roar of laughter was the reward of my effQrt at&#xD;
mathematical definition.&#xD;
'In the classics I was more successful. Ii thought&#xD;
Livy a bi~re, but I was delighted with Horace; and,&#xD;
when we. began the Greek drama, a new world was&#xD;
opened to~ me, on the accessible treasures of which I&#xD;
looked much as I fancy Ali Baba must have gazed&#xD;
upon the 'up-piled treasures of the Forty Thieves.&#xD;
With all my study, however, James Allen and Barney&#xD;
Fogg distanced me-the one by his genius, (he was a&#xD;
fine classical scholar,) the other by his indomitable&#xD;
habits of study. I was less studious than either. I&#xD;
began to write verses, and to send them, under ficti-&#xD;
tious signatures, to the newspapers. I was fond of&#xD;
correspondence, and wrote a great many letters. Be-&#xD;
sides, aS at the academy, I studied hard, or not at all,&#xD;
as the humour 'seized me. I roved over the hills and&#xD;
through the woods. I ransavked the college-library&#xD;
for the oldest 'and mustiest books. ' Old Burton and&#xD;
Sir Thomas Brown's Vulgar Errors were prime favour-&#xD;
ites. r waxed humorous in my' style, and the smile&#xD;
which my productions provoked, repaid me for the&#xD;
lowering looks of the conclave of the powers-the&#xD;
college council.&#xD;
&#xD;
LYND2E WEISS.&#xD;
At the beginning of th~ winter-vacation I went&#xD;
home. Much to my surprise, the committee of a&#xD;
neighboring school-district offered me the post of&#xD;
teacher in their school, and without so much as a visit&#xD;
to Paul Warren's, or an hour's chat with Jessie, I hur~&#xD;
ned away. After. a most critical examination, in which&#xD;
I was questioned in the occult mysteries of Daboll&#xD;
and J~indley Murray, from the number and sounds of&#xD;
the letters to the grammatical arcana of Thomson's&#xD;
Seasons, and.~ the equally profound secrets of* cube&#xD;
roots and the rule of three, I received a certificate,&#xD;
which assured all whom it might concern, that Mr.&#xD;
Lynde Weiss had been duly examined, according to&#xD;
the statute in such cases 'made and.provided, and was,&#xD;
in the opinion of the committee, qualified to teach the&#xD;
school in District No. '- for the space of one year.&#xD;
They were excellent people, those plain moun-&#xD;
taineers, and I was happy among them. All called&#xD;
me "Master," without any intention of violating the&#xD;
injunction of the New Testament. I had pupils much&#xD;
larger and older than myself. I was consulted on all&#xD;
knotty questions in law, politics, the sciences, religion,&#xD;
and my decision was much of' the same weight with&#xD;
them as was the reply of Counseller 5-., who used&#xD;
to say to the presiding judge, when he quoted the&#xD;
.Aicta of his predecessor, "I am older, sir, than that&#xD;
decision.&#xD;
A bitterly cold winter was that. But there were&#xD;
roaring fires-merry hearts and good cheer-moonlight&#xD;
sleigh-rides, and witchery more potent and dangerous&#xD;
than the very innocent bells were chargeable withal.&#xD;
I returned to college. Months rolled away, and I&#xD;
was weilnigh through the sophomore year. The cue-&#xD;
tomary. "exhibition" came on. I Wrote my oration&#xD;
with care. I remember but little about it save that&#xD;
there were some very crude notions in it on the subject&#xD;
of eloquence. It bad (as did all my productions) a&#xD;
spice of humour, and was very tolerably written.&#xD;
The 'day came, With trembling knees and a quiver-&#xD;

ing voice I ascended the platform. The chapel (for in&#xD;
the chapel was the exhibition) was thronged. As. I&#xD;
begaii' my oration it~ low and trembling accents, I hap..&#xD;
pened to look towards the throng of faces near the&#xD;
door, and caught the glance of Jessie Grayson. Away&#xD;
went all timidity ; and with a flashing eye, 'my head&#xD;
erect, my heart swelling and throbbing with an excite-&#xD;
nierit, that would have made "a forlorn hope" the post&#xD;
I could most covet, I went through the allotted task.&#xD;
There were hearty congratulations for me on all hands,&#xD;
and I now trod the streets with a prouder step. I be-&#xD;
gan to comprehend the tendency and the natural results&#xD;
of study. I grew ambitious. I began to pay particular&#xD;
attention' to the study of rhetoric-Jamieson being&#xD;
favourite author. I took unwearied pains in&#xD;
writing, using as few words as possible of Greek or&#xD;
Latin derivation, and substituting, whenever it was&#xD;
practicalAe, the simple Saxon English.*&#xD;
At the close of my second year, I went home to&#xD;
spend. the vacation, lit was late at night wheil I ar-&#xD;
rived. Munch soon exchanged 'his furious bark or the&#xD;
most extravagant caresses. The family, with the ex-&#xD;
ception of my uncle Hugh, had retired. The uproar&#xD;
which Munch atA the. stage-coach contrived to make&#xD;
in concert, brought him to the door.&#xD;
The same heartiness which had always distinguished&#xD;
him, gave tenfold value to his greeting.&#xD;
"Welcome home, Lynde 1" said he. "I am glad&#xD;
you happened to be' lat&amp;amp; in your arrival, for I have&#xD;
much to say to you."&#xD;
"How are you all ?"&#xD;
"Well; as are Jessie and the Warrens I have&#xD;
something to say to you," said he, wheri~ we were&#xD;
seated, "about your father and his affairs.&#xD;
"Nothing wrong about him ?"&#xD;
"We shall see. - In the first place, what I say is ~for&#xD;

best of' spirits. Good-night."&#xD;
"Good-night, uncle."&#xD;
It was long ere I slept. I tried to picture to myself&#xD;
the probable results of such a misfortune. How would&#xD;
my father bear the blow? and my aunt and sisters?&#xD;
My father was ~sure of a competence for his family.&#xD;
My brother could make his way in the world, and such&#xD;
a woman as Ann West would never come to want.&#xD;
What should I do ? What should I say to Jessie&#xD;
Grayson? These, and a thousand similar thoughts,&#xD;
kept me awake until nearly daybreak.&#xD;
When we met at breakfast, however, I believe I was&#xD;
successful in the attempt to appear cheerful and uncon~&#xD;
cerned. I resolved that I would see as little of Jessie&#xD;
as possible. So far as I knew, the attentions of Frank&#xD;
Gibson were not unwelcome. If they were not, and if&#xD;
he were a favoured suitor, I should thus 'spare myself&#xD;
and her the pain of a rejection; while, (and "my heart&#xD;
leaped at the thought,) if she loved me, the year that was,&#xD;

probably, to decide my father's fate, would not place&#xD;
me ma less favourable position. To carry out my in~&#xD;
mentions, .therefore,'I went, that very day, to see my&#xD;
foster-parents. I passed three days with them. Charles&#xD;
had grdwn to a fine manly-looking fellow. Paul was&#xD;
scarcely less changed. BAith had grown, too, almost&#xD;
out of my remembrance. Mary, whom I remembered&#xD;
as plain, and almost homely, bad become one of the&#xD;
loveliest girls in Boylston. I could now trace in her a&#xD;
very strong likeness to the mother. There was a love-&#xD;
liness' about the mother which is seldom seen, and as&#xD;
seldom mentioned, because it exerts a power which is&#xD;
difficult tQ be analyzed. It was the loveliness of pro.&#xD;
portion-karmony'in moral and physical character.&#xD;
She had a fine head, to look upon which gave you a&#xD;
sensation of indescribable pleasure; and the luxuriant&#xD;
braids of her golden hair-her exquisite proportions-&#xD;
her fine,* eloquent blue eyes-and, above all, her smile,&#xD;
which was the light of Paul Warren's home, made her&#xD;
one of the liveliestt women ii have ever seen. Joined&#xD;
to such qualities, conceive the patience, self-sacrifice,&#xD;
affection which characterize the sex, and you will not&#xD;
wonder, worthy reader, that I loved her.&#xD;
Mary had, as I have said, grown into a strong re-&#xD;
semblance to her mother. The younger sisters were&#xD;
yet small, though they, also, had' changed very much.&#xD;
On my return home I found Captain Gayger with&#xD;
my father, in the office. He' was standing, hat in&#xD;
Ja&amp;amp;nd, a1s if ready for his departure.&#xD;
"Where are you bound, Captain Gayger ?" I asked6&#xD;
"To Whitehall."&#xD;
"Would you like to have a passenger ?"&#xD;
"Yourself?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
With pleasure; but you must be aboard in an&#xD;
hour:'&#xD;
"Yery good."&#xD;
And. he left the. office. In an liQur I had every&#xD;
&#xD;
LYNDE WEISS6                 79&#xD;
thing in z'eadiness. I put Dash to his 8peed, and was&#xD;
just in time to get oA board6&#xD;
"Cast off that bow-fast !" shouted the skipper, and,&#xD;
keeping fast~ the stern4ine, he cast "The Empress" to&#xD;
starboard. . In five minutes tnore we were under way&#xD;
with a fine breeze on our larboard quarter.&#xD;
My heart smote me, ae .we lust sight; of the landing,&#xD;
that I had been so precipitate. I had. not seen Jessie&#xD;
at all. What would she think of me ~ Had I not used&#xD;
iher ill? I was thinking about asking Captain Gayger&#xD;
to set me ashore, when he came up to me, and, . with* a&#xD;
slap on my shoulder which was none of the gentlest,&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"Belay all that studying' , (thinking,) Jiynde! I'll&#xD;
put you on a triangle, and set you to scraping' the&#xD;
masts. Cheer up; jnan! Never get into the doldrun~s&#xD;
unless you're becalmed."&#xD;
And. he began, in tones that waked the echoes along&#xD;
the wood-covered banks of the Bouquet, j' The Bay of&#xD;
Biscay."&#xD;
"As she lay,&#xD;
On that day,&#xD;
In the Bay of Bisoay 0!"&#xD;
roared his crew; and, not to burden them with my own&#xD;
difficulties, I joined them in the chorus. With a fine&#xD;
breeze from the north-west we soon reached the lake,&#xD;
and, running well out to give the bar a berth, we bQre&#xD;
away towards our port of destination. We had a Long&#xD;
passage. What with calms, and some difficulty about&#xD;
our freight, ten days had elapsed ere we arrived *at&#xD;
]3oylston. On the evening of my return there was a&#xD;
large party assembled at Mr. Gibson's, and among the&#xD;
guests were the Graysons. Frank' Gtbson was most&#xD;
pointed in his attentions to Jessie, and it so happened&#xD;
that I saw but little of her6 The next day my father&#xD;
requested me to go to a neighbourin~ county to ar-&#xD;
range some matters of~ bt~siness, I was absent several&#xD;

&#xD;
days, and when I returned, there were but four days&#xD;
of the vacation at my disposal.&#xD;
I could defer it no longer. I must and would see&#xD;
Jessie, I said to myself, be the consecjuences what they&#xD;
might. I called at Mrs. Grayson's in the evening, and,&#xD;
much to my surprise, Jessie was absent. To my in-&#xD;
quiries Mrs. Grayson replied-amd somewhat coolly, I&#xD;
thought-that she had gone to a neighboring village,&#xD;
and would be absen1~ several days... I left them at an&#xD;
early hour.&#xD;
With a heavy heart did I return home. Parrying,&#xD;
as well as I could, the remarks about my evident de-&#xD;
pression, I spent three of the remaining holidays in&#xD;
hunting and fishing. On the fourth I took my gun,&#xD;
as usual, and, calling Munch, I set out for the moun-&#xD;
tains.* I met with little success. Going by Paul War-&#xD;
ren' s on my return, I bade them good-by. It was near&#xD;
sunset when I reai~hed home, and, as I entered the&#xD;
house, the first object that caught my eye was Jessie&#xD;
Grayson, seated in my father's arm-chair. Never had&#xD;
she appeared so lovely. I shook hands with her, and&#xD;
muttered some incoherent, blundering apology for&#xD;
having been so unneighbourly. I know not what I&#xD;
said, and she seemed as much embarrassed as myself.&#xD;
She took leave of my sisters at an ~'arly hour,.~ and I&#xD;
accompanied her home.&#xD;
It. was ~a beautiful evening in the latter part of&#xD;
August. The river was glistening in the moonlight,&#xD;
and t~ie tall old elms along its banks threw their huge&#xD;
shadows upon the road. We said little on the way;&#xD;
* but when we reached, the little wicket, beneath a huge&#xD;
elm that overshadowed the parsonage, I pointed to the&#xD;
river, the surface of which was broken into countless&#xD;
glistening ripples by. the cool west wind, and we stop-&#xD;
*   ped. The scene recalled many a pleasant'recollection&#xD;
of my boyhood, and we spoke of the past.&#xD;
"Jessie I" said 1, at length, and I took her hand in&#xD;
mine. It was withdrawn, and she made no reply.&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
"Jessie !" said I, again, "you have thought hardly&#xD;
of me. You"-&#xD;
"It is late, Mr. Weiss. I must bid you good-night--.&#xD;
a good-by, indeed, as you tell me you are going away&#xD;
in the morning. I wish you&#xD;
"Jessie, hear me! If you knew all-if you, knew&#xD;
"Hu~h! There's some one coming."&#xD;
"Good evening, Miss Grayson," said the flew-comer~&#xD;
"Hello, Lynde! how are you, old fellow? Thought it&#xD;
was Frank. Fine evening, Miss Grayson."&#xD;
"Very, sir."&#xD;
"Evenings alwa$18 fine this time o' year. Going&#xD;
back to-mQrrow, laynde? Of course you will, though.,&#xD;
Coach goes at four. You'll have to be up an' doin',&#xD;
bright an' early. No names booked but ours. Have&#xD;
all the inside to ourselves. How's all the folks, Miss&#xD;
Grayson ?"&#xD;
"Quite well, I'm obliged to you."&#xD;
"Glad to hear it. Heard your mother was poorly.&#xD;
Just left Frank. Says he'll have the buggy and bays&#xD;
a&#xD;
your door in the morning, for the promised drive to&#xD;
High Bridge. By Jove! it~s eleven o'clock! Going&#xD;
home, Lynde? I've something to say to you."&#xD;
And thus was I obliged to say a simple good~night,&#xD;
~ed off by the button by-Mr. Barney Yogg! The&#xD;
"something to say" was a request from Frank Gibson&#xD;
that I would write some verses for him, as he wished to&#xD;
give them .to Jessie Grayson!&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
LY~DE IS IN LOYE-"AND TROUBLE.-THE JOURNEY.-LYNDE SEEK~&#xD;
ETH .EMPLOYMENT.~HIS PURSE IN TIlE LAST ~STAGES OF DECLINE&#xD;
AND FALL..&#xD;
I RETURNED to college. The journey was not parti~&#xD;
cularly agreeable, for I was suffering with headache&#xD;
and Barney Fogg all the way. I recommended my&#xD;
studies; but ever, as I opened a book, there came the&#xD;
features of Jessie IGrayson. 'Her voice, too, rang in&#xD;
my ears-not in the gentle, musical tones of other&#xD;
days, but in the cold sounds of our parting: "It is&#xD;
late, Mr. Weiss." Most. truly could I say,&#xD;
"Thou ~ hast metamorphosed me;&#xD;
- Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,&#xD;
War with good counsel, set the world at naught;&#xD;
Made wit with musing weak; heart, sick with thought."&#xD;
Months passed. The customary exhibition of the&#xD;
junior class, was drawing' near, and I had already&#xD;
written my oration, when. I received the following let-&#xD;
ter from my uncle :-&#xD;
"BOYLSTON, July 9th, 18-~--.&#xD;
"My DEAR liNDE :-It .is as I feared. Messrs.&#xD;
Buckley &amp;amp; North have foreclosed the mortgage. Your&#xD;
father has lost heavily on the last shipment of lumber,&#xD;
and there' is no longer any hope. Bear it, my dear&#xD;
Lynde, as well as you can. I know not what to advise&#xD;
you. Come home, and we will see what can be done.&#xD;
"Your affectiQnate uncle,&#xD;
HUGH WEISS."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
time&#xD;
&#xD;
was always impulsive. Without giving myself&#xD;
for thought-stifling every suggestion of the pro.&#xD;
&#xD;
bable consequences of the *step-l sold books, furni~&#xD;
ture, a part of my wardrobe even, and, at sunset, I was&#xD;
ready for my. departure. The president very kindly&#xD;
gave me a letter of introduction to a friend of his in&#xD;
Washington, and at nine o'clock that evening I was on&#xD;
my way to the South.&#xD;
It was late the next morning when I reached White-.&#xD;
hall. I followed the throng of passengers, and jumped&#xD;
upon the deck of the nearest packet. As the horses&#xD;
started, the rain began to fall in that regular drizzle&#xD;
that promises a long periodiof rainy weather. I went&#xD;
below. Such a throng of passengers! Now that they&#xD;
had all left the deck, and collected in the cabin, there&#xD;
was scarcely room to contain them. The windows were&#xD;
closed to keep out the rains The lamps were lighted,&#xD;
and they filled the cabin with the senseintoxicating&#xD;
odour of fish~oil. The atmosphere became almost in~&#xD;
supportable. Some of the passengers were smoking.&#xD;
Some of the ladies were sea~sick. The helmsman was&#xD;
cursing, on deck, about some shortcomings of the&#xD;
driver; and some of the passengers were grumbling at&#xD;
"the miserable tub of a packet." Oh! the miseries of&#xD;
that long night!~ Unable to endure the oppressive air&#xD;
of the unventilated cabin, I went on deck, and seating&#xD;
myself on the baggage, I sat, drenched with rain,&#xD;
chilled, uncomfortable to the last degree, and heeding,&#xD;
at short intervals, the helmsman's gruff wartilng of,&#xD;
"Heads! Bridge !"&#xD;
I awaited the dawn. I thought it would never come.&#xD;
It came, however, and it heralded &amp;amp; brighter day. We&#xD;
reached Troy at nightfall.&#xD;
As the day dawned on the following morning., I&#xD;
reached New York. I slept until late. ; and when I&#xD;
entered Broadway the living tide was upon its pave-K&#xD;
ments. Oh ! what a sensation of loneliness and ,soli'&#xD;
tude did I feel in the midst &amp;amp;f that mighty throng~!&#xD;
~{ever have I felt so strongly the utter insignificance of&#xD;
a single human heart, as I did on th~t' memorable.&#xD;
morning. On, on, restlessly poured the human tide;&#xD;

&#xD;
and. the eye sought in vain for the kindly glance of&#xD;
friend, kindred, or acquaintance. It is undeniable that&#xD;
fhere is far less hearty social feeling in the city tfian&#xD;
in the country. The stern necessity which sits glaring&#xD;
upon the thousands of congregated poor-the grim&#xD;
skeleton of Want, that makes one at the poor man's&#xD;
feast~-the struggle for bread, for bfe,-these freeze&#xD;
the better sympathies, just as they are blunted and de-&#xD;
stroyed in the open boat, leagues away at sea, where&#xD;
hunger absorbs all other sensations. Pray to Heaven,&#xD;
good reader, that you may never meet want in a city.&#xD;
As I was going down the Delaware, I met, on board&#xD;
the steamer, a gentleman whom I remembered as an&#xD;
old friend of my father's. In our conversation he&#xD;
mentioned that he was going to Washington. The in-&#xD;
cident decided my course, and I travelled in company.&#xD;
with him.&#xD;
It was late in, the evening, owing to a detention of&#xD;
the cars, when I reached Washington. We were not&#xD;
long in finding quarters at Mrs. Van C-'s, on&#xD;
street. The next morning I called upon the gentleman&#xD;
to whom my letter was addressed, (a lawyer, and for-&#xD;
merly a classmate of the president of Clinton College,)&#xD;
and having presented it, made some inquiries about the&#xD;
chances for employment.&#xD;
"You have not selected the best place in the world,"&#xD;
said ,the~. lawyer, in a kindly tone,. removing his specta-&#xD;
cles, and holding Vhem in his hand; "there are a great&#xD;
many hungry mouths to feed in a city, and the capital&#xD;
abounds. in them. There is a. school 'at Bladensburg&#xD;
now vacant, and perhaps you can find employment&#xD;
there." a' letter from him to the trustees, I walked to&#xD;
Bladensburg-to be disappointed. Unaccustomed to&#xD;
walking, I was sadly exhausted when I returned to the&#xD;
city, and retired supperless to bed. Mr. K-, my&#xD;
considerate and gentleman-like fellow-traveller, came&#xD;
to my chamber to learn whether ]i~ were sick. I very&#xD;
frankly told him of my 'plans-.--the history of my some-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
what Quixotic journey-the horrors of a purse in ex-&#xD;
tremis-and the failure, thus far, of my efforts to fijid&#xD;
employment. With a kindness which I can never. for-&#xD;
get, he at once began to make inquiries in my behalf.&#xD;
Alas! he, too, met with no success. What should I&#xD;
do? There were others at Mrs. Van C-.-'s looking&#xD;
for employment. One was ~an applicant for an ap-&#xD;
pointment in the army. Another was in search of' a&#xD;
clerkship in one of the departments. A third was 'in&#xD;
search of another office. But they were not' penniless.&#xD;
They had friends to aid them.&#xD;
To my inexperienced eye there seemed no possible&#xD;
avenue ~f escape. 1 thought .of the West. Could I&#xD;
not "work" my way thither? As a drowning man&#xD;
clutches a straw, so did I at the thought of the mo-&#xD;
ment. I had money' enough to discharge my. obliga-&#xD;
tions to Mrs. Van C-; and, packing a portion of&#xD;
my wardrobe (now somewhat scanty) in a small bundle,&#xD;
I turned my steps westward. Crossing the Potomac a&#xD;
little above Georgetown, I walked several miles-I&#xD;
know not how far-on the Virginia. side, until fatigue&#xD;
compelled me to stop. I sat down on a log by the&#xD;
wayside, and again pondered upon what~ was to be&#xD;
done. If I could not endure the labour of walking,&#xD;
could I hope for employment as a labourer? I re-&#xD;
traced my steps to the city. Mr. K-.---- had met&#xD;
with better success in' his second effort. An advertise-&#xD;
ment in "The Intelligencer" led him to make applica-&#xD;
tion at the Columbian Academy,' on Ninth street. The&#xD;
next morning I was duly installed as second usher of&#xD;
the school, at a salary of one hundred and fifty dollars&#xD;
per annum.&#xD;
The building was large, and painted white. It had&#xD;
green shutters, and was surrounded by small shade-&#xD;
trees. It was neatly fenced, too, and, together with&#xD;
the other buildings, (the classical department, lodging-&#xD;
room, and recitation-rooms,) presented a very neat and&#xD;
pretty appearance. The walks were nicely gravelled,&#xD;

and the shrubbery and flowers made the place far more&#xD;
atjractive than is usual in the grounds of a. school.&#xD;
It may be readily supposed that I looked somewhat&#xD;
eagerly at my new employer. He was truly a remark-&#xD;
able man. His head was already white as snow, yet&#xD;
there was a military erectness, activity, and vigour,&#xD;
oftener belonging to thirty-five than to~ sixty. He was&#xD;
dressed, too, in a blue coat of military cut; and his&#xD;
white hair was brushed erectly, giving him a somewhat&#xD;
stern expression. This, however, was contradicted by&#xD;
the kindly glance of a gray eye and one of the plea-&#xD;
santest of smiles.&#xD;
The academy was ~divided by a half partition, sepa-&#xD;
rating, but not concealing from each other, the pupils&#xD;
of different ~sexes. Midway on the west side, between&#xD;
two doors,. (one for the girls, and the other. for the&#xD;
boys,) was the principal's own desk, to which he&#xD;
ascended by a number of steps. In front of this, and&#xD;
lower, was the desk of the principal usher, and, in&#xD;
front &amp;amp;f that, a chair, around which~ the classes came&#xD;
in succession. On each side of these desks were&#xD;
several rows of forms, capable of seating abou1~ two&#xD;
hundred pupils. In the rear were the recitation-rooms,&#xD;
which were provided with black-boards, and the lodg-&#xD;
ing-rooms.&#xD;
* I had not obtained a sinecure. A furious ringing of&#xD;
the bell at daybreak summoned me to my toil. Full&#xD;
of. life and ambition, the pupils came. thronging in. I&#xD;
assisted in hearing the morning tasks until seven&#xD;
o'clock. We then breakfasted. At eight we recoin-&#xD;
xrnrnced our labours. At twelve we dined. At one we&#xD;
again entered the school, and remained there until&#xD;
about five in the afternoon. In addition to all this, I.&#xD;
had copies to* write, and from fifty to one hundred pens&#xD;
to make, daily,. besides aiding my employer in making&#xD;
out bills. He was the mo~t industrious man I ever&#xD;
knew. his ~choo1 was a model of order, neatness, and&#xD;
regularity.. not a man of extensive in&#xD;

those branches which he professed to. teach, the Church&#xD;
of Rome could prefer no stronger claims to infallibility.&#xD;
It put him in a passion to call his dicta in question.&#xD;
He maintained, on . all occasions, that his school wa&amp;amp;&#xD;
the best in the Union, and the inference was irresisti..~&#xD;
ble, (and I have sometimes thought, correct,) that he&#xD;
was the best teacher. He was so, undoubtedly, in very&#xD;
many respects. He had-as had his puplls-..-.the genu-&#xD;
ine esprit de corps. He was active, vigilant, indefati-&#xD;
gable. He had served in the army, and his school,&#xD;
like his dress, had a military cast. He was proud of&#xD;
his profession, and that pride was the fnoving-principle&#xD;
of his life. It gave tone to every word, and look, and&#xD;
action. It never slumbered. Of course he was suc-&#xD;
cessful. He built no less than three academies in&#xD;
Washington, the grounds of which, through his indus&#xD;
try and. taste, are now among the ornaments of the&#xD;
city.&#xD;
This professional pride, by-the-by,&#xD;
greater or less extent, in all m&amp;amp;n. It is. found, to a&#xD;
seen in the&#xD;
undue estimate which a man puts upon his own pro-&#xD;

If he be a farmer, his Durham is. the greatest of&#xD;

He was one of the United Irishmen, and came to&#xD;
America in 1808, if I remember well. If the citizens&#xD;
of Washington ever build~ any local monuments, let the&#xD;

Irksome as was the toil of the school-room at first, I&#xD;
became accustomed to it, and loved it. As there was&#xD;
no school on Saturdays, I had 9pportunities to visit&#xD;
the capitol, and to see the lions of the three cities. I&#xD;
was far, however, from being contented. I was de-&#xD;
sirous to return to college and graduate, and the salary&#xD;
I was then receiving would not allow me to think of&#xD;
doing so sooner than three or four years. Accordingly&#xD;
I inserted an advertisement in "The National Intelli-&#xD;
gencer," as follows :-.&#xD;
"TEACHER'S NOTICE.-.-A young man from Clinton&#xD;
College, who has spent three years in that institution,&#xD;
wishes to procure a situation as a teacher. Refer to&#xD;
the lion. Messrs. A.- and 11-, of the House of&#xD;
Representatives."&#xD;
The advertisement was so far successful as to obtain&#xD;
me, through the kind, offices of my friends, a small&#xD;
school in the country, at a salary of four hundred dol-&#xD;
lars. I bought the necessary books, and recommended&#xD;
my studies. Too eager, however, to be prudent, I rose&#xD;
before day and studied late at. night. The very natural&#xD;
&#xD;
consequence was ill health, and I left my school and&#xD;
went home.&#xD;
It was a little after nightfall when I reached tny&#xD;
native village. I had left my trunk at the little village&#xD;
some four miles distant, where the steamboat touched,&#xD;
and travelled to 2Boylston on foot. Leaving the road,&#xD;
as I entered the village, I walked along the Ledge&#xD;
until I was opposite Allan Grftyson'5, and, without any&#xD;
definite purpose, descended and passed the house. On&#xD;
a rude bench beneath the patriarchal elm, that threw&#xD;
its long branches over the house, I thought I could dis-&#xD;
tinguish a human form. I approached, and there, with&#xD;
her head leaning, as in* sadness or ~weariness, on her&#xD;
hand, sat Jessie Grayson.&#xD;
"Jessie !" said I, in a low tone.&#xD;
"Dear Lynde! is it you? When did you come ?"&#xD;
"I have just arrived here, and if you knew how&#xD;
glad-Jessie! dear Jessie! i~ love you! I have loved&#xD;
you for years. Will you be mine ?"&#xD;
"Lynde! hear me. Had you, a year ago; said to&#xD;
me what you have now uttered, I could have made but&#xD;
one reply, and the sooner because mi~fortune had fallen&#xD;
upon you and yours. Events have occurred, hQwever,&#xD;
during your absence, (I know not whether you have&#xD;
heard of them,) which leave me but one reply-I can-&#xD;
not be yours, and we must not meet again I"&#xD;
"But"-.-&#xD;
"Do not try to change my decision. It is unalter-&#xD;
able. Farewell'! and may God bless you !"&#xD;
Before II could reply, she had left me and entered&#xD;
the house. I stood for a mQment benumbed--paralyzed&#xD;
by the crushing sense of misery that followed her part-&#xD;
ing words, and then, with frantic speed, I retraced my&#xD;
steps to the Ledge, and entered the woods. I plunged&#xD;
through its recesses in a delirium of excitement, taking&#xD;
no heed of the direction, ~and at length, exhausted by&#xD;
my furious speed, sank upon the ground at the fo6t of&#xD;
an enormous pine.&#xD;
I recalled ~he scene, beneath the elm. Could I go&#xD;

How should I best find an oblivion for the past? The&#xD;

"I will go," said I, aloud, and I rose and went on-&#xD;
ward.'. I was near the lake.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
THE DEPARTURE.AN UNEXPECTED MEETINO.-MR. LYNDE WEISS&#xD;
ARRIVES IN ALBANY.&#xD;
APPROACHING the shore of the lake, I followed it&#xD;
along at a rapid pace. The lights of the steamer were&#xD;
already visible, and I l~pd barely time to reach the&#xD;
wharf at Allenville. when she arrived. She came&#xD;
swiftly along until she was within a few hundred yards&#xD;
of the wharf, when, at a tap of the bell, her wheels&#xD;
stopped. With her headway sensibly checked, she&#xD;
rounded to quietly and gracefully, -~~hile her pretty&#xD;
yawl shot from beii~ath her quarter, and came rapidly&#xD;
to the shore. As ~he left the wharf, a band on board&#xD;
struck up the familiar air of "A Life on the Qcean&#xD;
Wave," and, as the notes swelled out upon the stillness&#xD;
of the night, they gave a new direction to my thoughts.&#xD;
Yes, thought I, as. we left the wharf, the sea is the&#xD;
home for me now. 'The hissing of the steam now&#xD;
ceased. The boat was run up, as if by magic, and the&#xD;
beautiful steamer glided away to the air of&#xD;
&#xD;
"What fairy4ike music&#xD;
Steals over the sea."&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
The' u~sic, 4he throng of passengers, and the excite~&#xD;
tn~nt :of 4~e new scene, restored me to something like&#xD;
quiet, and ;i~iy heart smote me for having thus abruptly&#xD;
turned toy badi upon kindred,. iend~, and home.&#xD;
&#xD;
90&#xD;
&#xD;
91&#xD;
&#xD;
I stifled reflection, however. Like Young Rapid, I was&#xD;
always restless-always disposed to "keep moving,"&#xD;
for the motion's sak~. The speed of the cars, when&#xD;
they are making thirty miles in the hour-.the topmost&#xD;
speed of a fine horse-the bounding of a ship over 'the&#xD;
billows two hundred and fifty geographical miles in a&#xD;
day,-are to me sources of the keenest sensations of&#xD;
physical pleasure. At midnight I retired.&#xD;
When I awoke the day. was breaking, and the men&#xD;
were warping the steamer . through the Elbow. We&#xD;
were soon at the wharf. A few steps brought me -to&#xD;
the packet, and, in ten minutes more, we were under&#xD;
way upon the muddy canal. We had a merry passage.&#xD;
There was an Irish comedian on .board, whose humour&#xD;
provoked humour in everybody. He kept the table in&#xD;
a roar at dinnertime; and when, after the tables were&#xD;
removed, he tapped a vendor of patent-medicine , fami.&#xD;
liarly on the shoulder and said, "I say, Sarsaparilla,&#xD;
let's go on deck!" the victim hirn~elf was obliged to&#xD;
join in the boisterous peal of laughter.&#xD;
It was nearly. night wh~n we arrived at the borough&#xD;
where we were to take the cars for Troy. As. we left&#xD;
the packet, a peor, weary-looking woman sat on the&#xD;
deck, holding in her arms &amp;amp; pale, emaciated child. The&#xD;
passengers rushed past her without so much as a kindly&#xD;
glance. The Irishman, .however, stopped for a moment&#xD;
as he passed them, and, laying his hand gently upon&#xD;
the head of the little sufferer, sai~1, in a low tone,&#xD;
"Poor little thing !" The mother looked up at the&#xD;
unexpected greeting. She made no reply, but her fine&#xD;
~eyes filled with tears as she looked her thanks. I shall&#xD;
not soon forget that glance.&#xD;
It wi's somewhat late when I reached Albany. As I&#xD;
sat in the bar-room, a tall,~ pale young man came in,&#xD;
and sat down quite near me. Two or three other&#xD;
young men soon followed. They must h~ve Leen ac-&#xD;
quaintances, .1 imagine, as he accosted one of them in&#xD;
this wise:&#xD;
"11ev y&amp;amp;u got any. corns ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"Yes; why?"&#xD;
"'Cause I can cure 'em. Got some salve here that'll&#xD;
cure 'em in a week; and no mistake. Like to git a~&#xD;
box ?"&#xD;
"Thank you, not this morning."&#xD;
"Don't you want to go a whaling' ?" asked the corn-&#xD;
exterminator, finding that his nostrum was not in de-&#xD;
mand.&#xD;
"A whaling? "&#xD;
"Yes?"&#xD;
"Why? You a'n't no agent, are you ?"&#xD;
"No, but my uncle is.' S'pose you go round and&#xD;
see him."&#xD;
"No, thank you! B'lieve I won't go a whaling' t~his&#xD;
hitch.'~&#xD;
The young man who had come in last now left the&#xD;
hotel, and I found myself alone with the corn-doctor.&#xD;
"Did you say that your uncle was an agent for a&#xD;
~whaling company ?" I asked.&#xD;
"Yes; "ud you like to go ?"&#xD;
"Perhaps so. What are the inducements ?"&#xD;
"Oh, good pay-good liv~n'-no work to do-goin'&#xD;
and comm' all the time in fine weather. 'S'pose you&#xD;
go round and see Uncle Tom."&#xD;
We went to the shipping-office. Conspicuously upon&#xD;
the door shone a flaming advertisement in capitals and&#xD;
exclamation-points.&#xD;
"NOTICI~!&#xD;
~~ONE HUNDRED MEN WANTED!!!&#xD;
"The subscriber wishes to obtain 100 active~ able-&#xD;
bodied young men, (Americans,) to go on a whaling&#xD;
voyage.     .          "THOMAS TUBBS, Agent."&#xD;
"Good 'morning !" said Mr. Tubbs, as we entered.&#xD;
His urbanity wa~ truly Parisian. "aood morning,&#xD;

whaling' business. It's very lucky ~you cow~e', to 'me. I&#xD;
&#xD;

is carried on under the equinoxious line, where it's all&#xD;

make a thousand' dollars the first voyage. Some go out&#xD;
green hands, and come back mates or cap'ns. Fact!&#xD;
There was Simon Armstrong-.mebbe you know'd&#xD;
him ?"&#xD;
"Wal, anyway, he went out, and come back a boat-&#xD;
steerer; an' you look as if you was a nation sight&#xD;
smarter'n him. The way them whalemen make money&#xD;
beats aWnatur. You'd better go."&#xD;
"How long are the voyages ?"&#xD;
"'Bout eighteen months; mebbe tew years. Here's&#xD;
the shippin'-papers."&#xD;
"Where. is the ship ?"&#xD;
"At New Bedford. No particular ship, ye know.&#xD;
You sign the articles, and the agents find you a ship."&#xD;
"But I have not money enough to go to New Bed-&#xD;
ford."&#xD;
"Oh, that's nothing . Bless your heart, the agents '11&#xD;
pay your expenses there, and your board while you are&#xD;
waiting' for a ship."&#xD;
"And how about clothes ?"&#xD;
"The agents, man-the agents. They furnishes yew&#xD;
with close, and a good chist, and tubacker to trade with&#xD;
the natyves. They'll trust ye for all out, till ye come&#xD;
back."&#xD;
The corn-doctor's attention, it would seem, had been&#xD;
previously drawn to the attractive features of the&#xD;
whaling-service, and the powerful imagination . of the&#xD;
eloquent Mr. Tubbs had so far deepened the impres-&#xD;
sion; that, with a little p&amp;amp;rsuasion on my part, he con-&#xD;
sented to sign the articles 'and go with me. We left&#xD;

Albany that very evening by one of the river-boats,&#xD;
and, at sunrise the next morning, we were in the office&#xD;
of one of the New York agents. After examining us&#xD;
very much as a butcher would examine a bullock, he&#xD;
decided that we "would do," and at five o'clock in the&#xD;
afternoon he shipped us on board one of the Sound&#xD;
steamers for Providence. Our passage was paid by a&#xD;
man who had it~ (in company with half a dozen other&#xD;
"green hands") in special charge.&#xD;
When the bell rang for supper, I took my seat at&#xD;
the table. I had nearly finished a hearty meal when&#xD;
the steward saluted me with-&#xD;
"Your ticket, sir, if you please."&#xD;
"I haven't any.&#xD;
"Fifty cents, then, will do."&#xD;
"I haven't so much about me.'&#xD;
"Thei~what the devil are you doing here ?"&#xD;
"There's a man on deck that has charge of me."&#xD;
"Has charge of you ?"&#xD;
"Oh, you're a whaleman ?"&#xD;
"I'm going to be."&#xD;
"Wal, jist allow me to insinuate, in the politest way&#xD;
in the world, that you're in the wrong box. You take&#xD;
a deck-passage. Y6u'veiao sort o' right in this cabin,&#xD;
nor be-aft the wheels."&#xD;
'~ I went on deck-forward. There were a score~ of&#xD;
poor Irishwomeri lying about on' the baggage and&#xD;
freight. The.y looked half-starved, emaciated, sick,&#xD;
hopeless. "God help them !" I said to myself. The&#xD;
night was cold. It had' been a "raw, rheumatic day,"&#xD;
and the night-ugh! I shiver to think of it. Our&#xD;
driver did not engage berths for us, and I had no&#xD;
money. The cold, raw wind rushed through the gang-&#xD;
ways in freezing currents, and, drowsy, weary, shiver-&#xD;
ing with cold, wet, (for the rain began to fall about ten&#xD;
o'clock in the evening)-oh! what a night was that!&#xD;

baggage..&#xD;
"Don't you belong forward?" said some. one to me,&#xD;
in tones not the gentlest in the world.&#xD;
"Yes, but".-.&#xD;
"Never mind the buts; you must stay forward."&#xD;
And forward I went,. and looked gloomily around&#xD;
upon my fellow-sufferers. God help The poor! It was&#xD;
not yet day when we arrived at Providence. We were&#xD;
hurried into a dirty, half-warmed car, which was filled&#xD;
with smoke by a filthy tin lamp, that emitted a faint,&#xD;
phosphoric gleam, but a most decidedly&#xD;
"Ancient, and a fish-like smell 1"&#xD;
Some of the "greenies waxed jocose 'over our mise-&#xD;
ries. One was a journeyman tailor. Another had been&#xD;
driving a charcoal-wagon. A third was a blacksmith.&#xD;
The rain clattered furiously against the panes. Day&#xD;
'at length dawned.&#xD;
"11-li and blazes !" said on&#xD;
git to Bedford ?"'           e,        we never&#xD;
said' be darned of I'm in any hurry to git there !"&#xD;
another.&#xD;
"There 'tis now !" said a third.&#xD;
A Frenchman, who had hitherto kept silence, now&#xD;
tapped the lid of a venerable snuff-box, and having&#xD;
passed it very politely to his neighbours, averred, with&#xD;
a shrug, that he was "6ie~z aise dat we was arrive."&#xD;
"So, dat isoh New Petford !" said a Dutchman be-&#xD;
hind me.&#xD;
The cars stopped. We were huddled" into a coach,&#xD;
and, after a short drive, we were' set down at the Rev.&#xD;
Mr. L-~-'s boarding-house. lie was a worthy man,&#xD;
though irritable' to the last degree. His partner was&#xD;
one of the most generous men I ever knew. The old&#xD;
housekeeper was a clever body, (in the American signi-&#xD;
fication of that word,) and there were some two or&#xD;
three younger' women. There were, at least, a score&#xD;

of boarders, and such a medley I never saw. Divers&#xD;
kindreds and tongues," a variety of size, and all&#xD;
cornplexio~~, from Day &amp;amp; Martin to Caucasian. Maf-&#xD;
fit's and Knapp's melodies were then in vogue, as much&#xD;
as the Ethiopian strains now-a-days, and a broth of a&#xD;
boy from the Emerald~ Isle declared it to be the&#xD;
"hoith o' fun," when he could engage all hands in&#xD;
singing&#xD;
"011! I'i~i bound for the land of Canaan !"&#xD;
in a roisterly chorus, ~o loud as to bring old L- to&#xD;
the door in a tearing passion.&#xD;
"I do declare !". he would say, "I do declare, I will&#xD;
not have such a disgraceful noise kept up here,!"&#xD;
It is a somewhat significant fact that Mr. L-&#xD;
selected the very leader of all the numerous instruments&#xD;
of household disturbance, to act as moderator in his&#xD;
absence ! The said moderator being none other than&#xD;
my friend the corn-doctor.&#xD;
Those were memorable days,-~marked by no im~&#xD;
portent events, not stamped with blood-thrilling in-&#xD;
cidents,-but they were a strange page of my book of&#xD;
- life. 'II wandered through the busy streets of the city&#xD;
of palaces, pondering on the chances that had brought&#xD;
me there. I saw much of life in those days. ]3e.fore,&#xD;
IL had looked more intently on the merl3 mechanism of&#xD;
* society. Now I began to examine, with a hungry man's&#xD;
earnestness, "the living creature within the wheels."&#xD;
As I wandered about the streets, an occasional gleam&#xD;
of life's sunshine caught my eye. It was a curly-headed&#xD;
child, mayhap, at play among the flowers; a 'home-&#xD;
scene ;-sire and mother and child in a group; dimly,&#xD;
and but for a moment, seen through an open door or&#xD;
window. It was, perhaps, a little band of worshippers&#xD;
in some "upper chamber," (I have an especial liking&#xD;
for life in chambers,) joining in some stirring' hymn&#xD;
that conjQred up many a Sabbath-scene of home; or&#xD;
the simple annals of the fishermen of Galilee. A coach&#xD;
rolled by me, and a fair face was visible. A fine eye,&#xD;

arrested by the earnestness of mine, sought, in That&#xD;
passing glance, to interpret it. Children gambolled&#xD;
along the sidewalks. They had forgotten, if they had&#xD;
ever known, or .heard, that Want had yet her altars,&#xD;
reeking with the heart's blood of hecatoinbs. The lover&#xD;
and his mistress passed me. I envied them, and sighed.&#xD;
Age passed me, and looked kindly upon me for a mo~&#xD;
ment-.and passed on. *The merchant saw me. My&#xD;
garb told him my destination. He looked as if his&#xD;
thought were, "The~ sea is no place for you ;" and&#xD;
passed on. I learned much of life, and poverty waa&#xD;

THERE is, perhaps, no class of men that" is made up&#xD;
of so many and so odd Yarieties as that of sailors. It&#xD;
is the first thing the landsman remarks on becoming&#xD;
acquainted with sea-faring men. There is, it' is~ readily&#xD;
granted, diversity of character among all classes of'&#xD;
laborers; but at sea, just 'as you go abruptly from&#xD;
burning suns to' polar snows; so you leave the middle&#xD;
range of unremarkable characters for the very poles of&#xD;
oddity, originality, and inconsistency.' This is especially&#xD;
true of our men-of-war; where a sprig of nobility jos-&#xD;
ties a sprig of the law, ~liere all parties and sects, all&#xD;
kindred and tongues are more or less adequately repre-&#xD;
sented. The decayed or runaway gentleman messes&#xD;
with boors and charcoal-venders. Clergymen and doe-&#xD;

cation of "slush'~' (grease) to the same spar. Every&#xD;
trade and profession is represented. Qecasionally' you&#xD;
find before. the mast a skilful navigator. indeed, it is&#xD;
considered one of the last of~ possible dangers, at sea,&#xD;
that, were the captain and officers to die, no one can be&#xD;
found' to navigate the vessel to her destination, or to the&#xD;
nearest consulate.&#xD;
ii make these remarks by way of preface to the state-&#xD;
ment that I found at my boarding-house a medley of&#xD;
characters, the. oddity and diversity of which were won-&#xD;
derful. There was .a musician, a young man of fine&#xD;
acquirements, who played the flute to perfection. An-&#xD;
other was an accomplished violinist. There was a&#xD;
blacksmith, a schoolmaster, a stage-driver, a brick-&#xD;
layer, a crier of charcoal; a Dutchman, a' Frenchman,&#xD;
three Portuguese, a Spaniard, two South-Sea Islanders.&#xD;
Among others, was the corn-doctor of whom I have&#xD;
spoken. He was something of a character. He, was a&#xD;
bundle of inconsistencies. He had, apparently, the&#xD;
very nicest feelings of honour, yet I had more than one&#xD;
proof that he was unscrupulous in the pursuit of any&#xD;
object in which he was really interested. He was a&#xD;
new phase of character to me. He was ceaselessly&#xD;
scheming. lie could' see, in the simplest actions of&#xD;
others, parts merely of some preconceived plan. He&#xD;
could not conceive of any action without an express de-&#xD;
sign. He had a smattering~ of law, thedogy, French,&#xD;
chemistry~-what not? He loved large words. He&#xD;
spoke mysteriously of his ancestry.&#xD;
"You don't know me, Weiss; you never will ;" he&#xD;
said to me one day.&#xD;
"I do not seek to "'&#xD;
"Yeu would be surprised, if you knew my ancestry(&#xD;
"No doubt."&#xD;
And then he would leave th~ subject. He was tall,'&#xD;
well-formed, and singularly easy and gentleman-like in&#xD;
his bearing~; yet inclined tQ 1~e authoritative, overbear~&#xD;
ing,, and self-important. With all his faults, he was&#xD;
st4ctiy temperate. He had a keen sense of the ludi-&#xD;
&#xD;
LYNDE WEISS.&#xD;
crous, and a fund of humour ~withal, that' made him .a.&#xD;
very pleasant companion. I took a strong liking to&#xD;
him. Not that I was blind to his faults; but he seemed&#xD;
to have a special liking for me. He' was anew volume'&#xD;
to me. He, by design, or otherwise, put me on .remark-&#xD;
ably good terms with myself; and what With this, and&#xD;
our inevitable daily association, I became so much at-.&#xD;
tached to him that I was never happy away from him.&#xD;
He seemed equally devoted to me. I Was too poor to&#xD;
suspect him of interested motives'; and so we became&#xD;
inseparable friends. We walked, rode, sailed to~&#xD;
gather.&#xD;
New Bedford is a charming city. Its streets are well&#xD;
laid out, comfortably paved, and beautifully shaded.&#xD;
The sea-approach to it is very fine. The scenery is&#xD;
picturesque. There are no 'grand features; but there&#xD;
is a diversity of hills, islands, capes, and bays, that&#xD;
make it a gem of a scene in summer. We found, in our&#xD;
rambles, some 'half-a-score of views of it, among which&#xD;
it was not easy to select the best. ~These, and the roads&#xD;
through the surrounding woods, whiled 'away many an~&#xD;
hour for. us that would otherwise have hung heavily&#xD;
upon our hands. The spring was ripening into summer.&#xD;
The grass' was green again in the fields; the wild-flow-&#xD;
ers decked the hedges; the birds were singing; and&#xD;
the trees were putting on their summer drapery of'&#xD;
beauty. And then the glorious sunshine! The bay,&#xD;
its surface broken into countless ripples by the breeze,&#xD;
glistened in its beams. The fiercer winds of March had&#xD;
given Place to airs as gentle and wellnigh as warm as&#xD;
the trades of the South Sea; and I fretted at the delay&#xD;
which kept me a pensioner upon the outfitters.&#xD;
My friend, the doctor, was not so enthusiastic, lie&#xD;
was, despite his eccentricities,, eminently a practical&#xD;
man. He had vastly the advantage of me in the savor&#xD;
vivre. lie acted on system in all things; while I de-&#xD;
tested all schemes and plans. It 'is really a wonder&#xD;
why I liked him '80 well. With all my warmth of feel-&#xD;
'ing, I was never popular among my asso~iates.~ No one&#xD;

took liberties with me. No one sought my company, as&#xD;
a general thing. The boarders always prefixed the Mr.&#xD;
to my name; while Tom, Dick, Joe, UIarry~ and the like,&#xD;
were in the current style of address.&#xD;
in this respect the doctor was my opposite. He had&#xD;
always a knob of listeners about him. He could tell&#xD;
~" a good story." I could not.&#xD;
He contrived, somehow, to be always in funds; and&#xD;
he seemed angry if IL would, not accept from him 8uch&#xD;
trifling amounts as these cheap enjoyments usually cost&#xD;
us. lie won, from me, gradually, my whole history.&#xD;
With a boy's earnestness I told him, over and over&#xD;
again, of my native village; ~f my earlier history; and&#xD;
my "whole course of love." And he was so courteous&#xD;
a listener that I was never tired of repeating to him&#xD;
what seemed, for some reason, to be of so much interest&#xD;
*to him.&#xD;
The weather was unfavorable for the carpenters,&#xD;
and we waited long for the good 'ship, "The Whale~&#xD;
hunter," to be pronounced ready for sea. Week after&#xD;
week passed, during which IL tried to become accus-&#xD;
tomed to going aloft, and to learn something of "the&#xD;
ropes." Meanwhile, Doctor Dodge, (such was his name&#xD;
at the boarding~hou8e,) on more than one occasion, pro-&#xD;
posed to me to run away. He also hinted to me the&#xD;
feasibility of projects of his .own, which would infalli~&#xD;
lAy enrich us both; and when he spoke of my home, he&#xD;
had nearly won me to-hjs purpose. What they were I&#xD;
knew not, nor do I know now. IL am in doubt whether&#xD;
he haZ any we~et~ned purpose. It was his nature to&#xD;
scheme, and what he sought to do was never done by&#xD;
direct means, so long as indirect agencies were at all&#xD;
practicable. He constantly asserted that he was going&#xD;
to sea and in the same' ship with me. 'The "Whale-&#xD;
hunter," he s~iid, was his e~p~cial favourite, and,&#xD;
though he. did not wish to e~t~r the whaling-service, he&#xD;
would sooner do so than part with me!&#xD;

It was 'more 'than a fortnight before he recovered. Oh,&#xD;
how wearily the days dragged their"' lingering length"&#xD;
Besides Doctor Dodge, there was one other person to&#xD;
whom I became attached. This was the superintendent&#xD;
of the boarding-house. He was a quiet an~I unassuming&#xD;
man, and a general favourite among the boarders.~ lie&#xD;
was remarkably unselfish. He 'had a smile and a kihd&#xD;
word for everybody. He did not admire my ~friend&#xD;
the doctor, ho&#xD;
guard. ' wever, and he warned me to be oxi my&#xD;
With these two exceptions, I had little to say to&#xD;
any of the household. I 'do not make acquaintances&#xD;
readily, as a general thing. I retained my pride, not-&#xD;
withstanding my change of garb,' (the outfitters had&#xD;
given me a sailor suit,) and although 'I was not con-&#xD;
sciously reserved, my bookish habits and flianner, or&#xD;
something else, kept the boarders aloof from 'me. They&#xD;
could not avoid noticing my efforts to learn~ something&#xD;
of my. new employment. I' found myself gradually&#xD;
'forming the habit of regarding the sea as my future&#xD;
stage of action, and I was ~not ~ little gratified, one&#xD;
day, by hearing one of the' boarders say to another.-.--'&#xD;
"Queer feller, that. 'Smart seller, tew, I guess.".&#xD;
"Yes," said the other. ".Be a skipper, one o' these&#xD;
days, I'm thinking. "&#xD;
The day was announced for hauling off into the&#xD;
stream. It was but 'a few 'days before that occurrence,&#xD;
that my friend Wellfleet, the superintendent, eam6 to&#xD;
me and eaid-.&#xD;
"Weiss, what say you to a walk ?"&#xD;
"Where do you propose to go 7"&#xD;
"Oh, not far. 'I want you to see and hear a friend&#xD;

"Well, 'I will go. Why not ask all the boarders ?"&#xD;
"I have."&#xD;
"And they will ge?"&#xD;
Armin-arm we departed, nigh a 'score of us, and,&#xD;
~fter .a walk of about a mile, we found ourselves at a&#xD;
small, 'neat chapel. The bell had ceased. ringing ere&#xD;
we arrived, and we entered in the same order as we&#xD;
had come. The services had' already commenced. The&#xD;
worshippers were singing to a sweet air, full of 'energy.&#xD;
"Awake, my soul! stretch every nerve,&#xD;
And press with vigour on !"&#xD;
I looked at the occupant of the desk. . He was a&#xD;
man of, small stature. He had a fine head. His eye&#xD;
was full' of earnestness and devotion, and his manner&#xD;
inspired m~ with a reverence akin to awe. iXe prayed,&#xD;
the little congregation 'all.'kneeling. I can never forget&#xD;
the soft' low, earnest, musical tones, of his' voice.&#xD;
Happening to 'raise my eyes, I saw on the wall&#xD;
above his head-&#xD;
~'TIME ROLLS ON; ETERNITY hASTENS,&#xD;
in largp capitals., I shidl not soon forget the impres-&#xD;

An eloquent sermon followed, and then the worship-&#xD;
pers sang the beautiful .air which may be known to my&#xD;
readers as Naomi:&#xD;
"'Path~'r'! whatever of earthly liliss,&#xD;

at me when he bade me good~night,. and said-&#xD;
"You and I would never quarrel, I. think." And&#xD;
he left me. I had, years afterwards, cause to recall.&#xD;
the remark.&#xD;
The, next evening there was a meeting.-.~ conven-&#xD;
tion, it was eaile~l.-.-.-of the abolitionists, I found&#xD;
Liberty' Hall thronged, and Wendell Phillips was thrill-&#xD;
ing the multitude with his eloquence. Jove! in what&#xD;
a delirium of excitement did his burning eloquence.&#xD;
leave me! He speaks, and lectures even, withetit&#xD;
notes. But his memory is so tenacious, his reasoning&#xD;

My moVning walk was usually to the wharf, where&#xD;
"The. Whale-hunter" lay. She was a' beautiful ship.&#xD;
of about four' hundred tons. I accustomed ~m~y~self to&#xD;
going aloft, in order that it might be a less irksome&#xD;
task at~ sea. It was some~ time, however, before I ven-&#xD;
tured above' the cat-harpings, aiid when I did accom-&#xD;
plish that memorable feat, I clung with might and&#xD;
main to the topmast rigging, a~nd looked tremblingly&#xD;
downward upon the deck, as distant, to my lubberly&#xD;
vision, as the realms of Pluto from upper air. I soon&#xD;
overcame this timidity; and was quite at home any-&#xD;
where about the. ~bip' except the jib-boom----a place&#xD;
which, though I never shrank from going there, I&#xD;
dreaded.whe.n I had been months a~t sea.&#xD;
I was fond of conversing with 'the patient, pains~&#xD;

cordingly, when we were summoned one morliing to&#xD;
have an interview with the captain, I went with several&#xD;
others to the office of Messrs. Twist &amp;amp; Screw, the&#xD;
aget~ts. I must do them the justice to say that they&#xD;
treated me with uniform kindness, and, so far as r&#xD;
could discover, j;he utmost fairness. Both were ger~tle~&#xD;
man-like, and stood fairly among their fellow-citi~ens&#xD;
as merchants 'and as men. So far,' therefore, as I, am&#xD;
c6ncerned, and so far as I am acquainted with "outfit-&#xD;
ters," they are not always the ghouls they have been&#xD;
represented to be.&#xD;
Captain Beverly appeared well. He was of large&#xD;
stature, and somewhat inclined to corpuloncy. His&#xD;
features were regular, and he was decidedly handsome.&#xD;
He looked manly and good-humnoured, and, from all I&#xD;
could see, IL set him down as being conscientious, firm,&#xD;
and decided, but well-tempered; such a man as sailors&#xD;
mean . to describe when they say, "You always know&#xD;
where to find him."&#xD;
I do nOt know', how far I' was distinguishable by my&#xD;
own dress and habits, but niy observation~ soon .taught&#xD;
m~ie to know' a candidate for the whaling-service at sight.&#xD;
He goes to New Bedford in quite a flow of. animal&#xD;
spirits, with pleasant visions of "a home on the rolling&#xD;
deep." He lnts heard, and perhaps sung, the chorus&#xD;
of the 'fine, old song-&#xD;
So happy are we,&#xD;
mining Fearless and free,&#xD;
away, Q'er the dark blue sea.&#xD;
He. has' heard of the, green 'isles-houri homes, of the&#xD;
South' Seas-of the fruits of the' tropics-of lands of.&#xD;
endless summer,. But' he has seen only one side of the&#xD;

crest, forswears thin potations, and taketh. to gin-.-&#xD;
smokes a pipe-swears lustil~y-4doff~ hi~ "shore togs,"&#xD;
and calls everybody "shipmate." At last his vessel&#xD;
hauls off into the stream, and an hour or two in grind-&#xD;
ing "old irons" (he being employed, in turning the&#xD;
grindstone) begins to rob "the deep, blue sea" of some&#xD;
of its romance.&#xD;

UNEXPECTED ARRIYAL.~TREACHERY.~T~ QUAflREL.&#xD;
A PEW days before the one appointed for hauling into&#xD;
the stream, I .was surprised by a most unexpected oc-&#xD;
currence. Mr. Wellfleet came in about sunset one&#xD;
evening, and handed me a note. I was still more as-&#xD;

out a postmark..&#xD;
"Of course, he is in town 7" 1 said to Mr. Welifleet.&#xD;
"Yes! at the Parker House."&#xD;
"You have seen him, perhaps."&#xD;
" Yes, several times."&#xD;
II opened the note, and read a~ follows:&#xD;
"PARKER ROUSE, Thursday evening.&#xD;
"My DEAR IJYNPE :---We were uneasy about you,&#xD;
and, after some days' inquiry, we traced you to New&#xD;
2Redford. Now, we (Mr. Grayson, Jessie, and Kate&#xD;

affected his health and spirits; so much so, indeed, that&#xD;
he felt unequal to a journey from Boylston to this city.&#xD;
I need hardly say to you that, under these circum-&#xD;
stances, it is very desirable for you to accompany us&#xD;
home~ Do not desert us, Lynde. We have interest&#xD;
enough t&amp;amp; establish you in business; or, if' you so pre-&#xD;
fer, Counsellor'S--" will give you a seat in his olfiee&#xD;
as a student. ~Jome .and see me, or shall I wait upon&#xD;
you at .your quarters?&#xD;
"Your affectionate uncle,&#xD;
I was l6ng in coming to a decision. I thought of my&#xD;
father, and resolved to go home; and then Jessie Gray-&#xD;
son's rejection of my suit determined me to go to sea.&#xD;
Was it possible, I asked myself', that sh~ knew the pur-&#xD;
pose of my uncle's coming? No. She had too much&#xD;
native delicacy for that. Had i~iy uncle relied on the&#xD;
sight of her face, and the calm unanswerable logic of my&#xD;
sister Rate, to persuade me to forego my purpose?&#xD;
Again I thought of my father, and decided to go home.&#xD;
Mr. Welifleet came in, as I closed the debate, end i~d-&#xD;
vised me very earnestly to abandon the idea of ~going&#xD;
to sea.&#xD;
"You have for many.years been a student,'.? said he.&#xD;
"The habits of your whole life unfit you for the Ia-&#xD;
bours and hardships ~f the sea. You have been deli-&#xD;
cately nurVured,-~you will be exposed to hardships al-&#xD;
most beyond the power of endurance. You have been&#xD;
accustomed to good society; you are going among the&#xD;
lowest and most filthy, vulgar, and obscure of the dozen&#xD;
nations which you will dind represented in theforecastle.&#xD;
You have never known the want of wholesome and&#xD;
palatable food; as~ a sailor, you must know it. You&#xD;
have been accustomed to regular and unbroken sleep,-&#xD;
four hours one night, and', eight the 'next, on deck, will&#xD;
be your lot in goodweather. In bad weather, and when&#xD;

"I will."&#xD;
"You will?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"That's right. I congratulate you. 'Come, let's go&#xD;
to the Parker House, and ~ee your uncle."&#xD;
"Not in this dress."&#xD;
"Never mind the dress. Walk by the hotel with me,&#xD;
and if you would rather not go in, I'll call your uncle.&#xD;
out, and you can walk with, him. If you want ~money&#xD;
or clothing, that is very easily arranged: I can supply:&#xD;
you, and you may pay me at your leisure. By-the-by,&#xD;
do you know that your uncle has been here for several'&#xD;
days?"&#xD;
"No."&#xD;
"He came on Monday. It was with some difficuhy&#xD;
that ~he found you, and he hardly knew, he says, how&#xD;
to begin the negotiation."&#xD;
"That is surely no very difficult matter."&#xD;
"Why, I do not know," said Mr. Welifleet, with a~&#xD;
significant smile. "Boys are~ obstinate, you know;&#xD;
sometimes. By-the-by, now I think of it, where's your&#xD;
friend Dodge ?"&#xD;
"I am unable to say.&#xD;
"He has decamped, I suspect."&#xD;
"Hardly."&#xD;
"At any rate, he has not been at the house since&#xD;
Monday, and this is Thursday evening. However, it's&#xD;
time we were going."&#xD;
Drawing my arm through his own, Mr. WelllIeet then&#xD;
walked with me to the Parker House. He left me at&#xD;
the door 'and entered' the~ hotel.&#xD;
"Come in; Weiss," said he, as he came back.&#xD;
"They're all at tea, and nobody will see you."&#xD;
I followed him into the 'hotel, and up a single flight&#xD;
of stairs. He advanced a few steps and then paused.&#xD;
"That's the room, No. -," said he, as he pointed to&#xD;
an open door, and he left me.&#xD;

the sound of voices. For one of them, I could have&#xD;
sworn it was that of one who was still dear to me; I&#xD;
could hear the throbbing of my heart as I stopped to&#xD;
listen. There wa~ a man's voice in reply. I stepped&#xD;

"Ha! is. that the tune ?" he asked with a sneer.&#xD;
"Yes; do you understand it ?"~&#xD;
"I should feel honoured in receiving a lesson; but&#xD;

BThEAM.&#xD;
M~ uncle, it seems, kr~ew me too well to remonstrate,&#xD;
and I did not see him at~all. Doctor Dodge disap-&#xD;
peared. Two days after the occurrences of the last&#xD;
chapter, the outfitters sent for us to select our outfitst4&#xD;
My own allotment was a monkey jacket, round jacket,&#xD;
trousers for warm and cold weather, shirts, stockings,&#xD;
tarpaulins, blankets, and a hay bed. I am but an in-&#xD;
different financier, but I thought the prices reasonable.&#xD;
The outfitters were certainly very liberal, and they dis~&#xD;
armed me of my prejudices against them.&#xD;
The day came to haul into the stream. Qur 8ky~&#xD;
blue chests were high up-piled on a stout truck. We&#xD;
bade the outfitters good-by, and left the shop in ~&#xD;
straggling order, much like a fleet in a gale of wind.&#xD;
Motley was the "wear." Our chestswere soon huddled&#xD;
into the forecastle. The fasts were cast off. A warp&#xD;
was passed to the steamer Telegraph, (of which exploit&#xD;
pars magnafui.e'). and we were speedily under way. The&#xD;
pilot leaped up to the night-heads, and testily issued his&#xD;
orders.&#xD;

Such were some of the elements of the hubbub. We&#xD;
anchored opposite the light-house on Clark's Point.&#xD;
The steamer left us, and we were left to amuse our-&#xD;
selves as best we might.&#xD;
I discovered that there were many on board whose&#xD;
faces I had not before seen. It was the understanding&#xD;
(I know not whence it came) that we were to have on&#xD;
board the Whale-hunter a picked crew of young Ame-&#xD;
ricans. We had, indeed, undergone a. personal inspec-&#xD;
tion by Captain Beverly, and I supposed that I was&#xD;
going' to ~see a rather "select society." I found in the&#xD;
forecastle, however, one Dutchman, one negro, one&#xD;
Canadian, one Spaniard, one Portuguese, one Chilian,&#xD;
and a South-Sea Islander, in the number of my ship-&#xD;
mates. The scene was a queer . one. From such occa-&#xD;
sional glimpses as I could catch while I arranged~ my&#xD;
berth, I tried to form some idea of my future mess-&#xD;
mates. There were some good faces among them.&#xD;
They were occupied in divers Ways. One was playing&#xD;
the violin. Another wearied our ears with a wheezing&#xD;
accordion. Some were playing cards. Some slept.&#xD;
Some were mending, "fixin' for Cape' Horn," as they&#xD;
expressed it.&#xD;
'This, by-the~by, is a singular trait of sailors. You&#xD;
may see them, in the earlier part of the voyage, putting&#xD;
patch upon patch, until you cannot divine the original&#xD;
colour6 Thrift herself would blush at their superior&#xD;
economy. Well, months, perhaps years, pass away.&#xD;
Jack comes home with some hundreds of dollars due&#xD;
him. A thousand to one he is drunk in six hours after&#xD;
he gets ashore, and his money goes in three dayW or&#xD;
six; and then he goes to sea again-to economize.&#xD;
On the following day the wind was directly in our&#xD;
teeth, and we lay at anchor all day. The Whale-hunter&#xD;
began to show her mettle, as the long swell rolled in&#xD;
from seaward, tossing, uneasily at her moorings, and&#xD;
fretting like a chained mastiff in his kennel. " We&#xD;
gave her the best bower and a goodly scope of cable,&#xD;
and she behaved better. There were some faint fore-&#xD;
&#xD;
LYNDE WEISS.               ill&#xD;
shadowings of sea-sickness during the day. There was&#xD;
a very noticeable Solemnity on divers faces. It might&#xD;
be from grave reflections. It was, more probably, the&#xD;
"shadows before'7 of events to come when we. should&#xD;
be fairly at sea. For my own part, I stifled all thoughts&#xD;
of home. I overhauled my ~chest,. an invaluable re-&#xD;
sourse to all sailors.' I climbed the rigging; I wrote&#xD;
in my journal; and so got through' the day.&#xD;
On the following morning it blew great guns from the&#xD;
north-west. The captain and pilot, came on 'board, and&#xD;
we got under way. 'The wind was so fresh that we&#xD;
could only show whole topsails. The Whale-hunter was&#xD;
cast to port. She bounded, as she fell off, with a curveb&#xD;
like a war-horse, and my veins tingled with pleasure as&#xD;
she gathered way. As the pilot left us, I happened to&#xD;
look over the bulwarks. A yacht wa~ passing *us.* In.&#xD;
a group that were seated in the stern-sheets,, I saw a&#xD;
face that was familiar to me. As I looked, he rose de-&#xD;
liberately, lifted his hat, and made ihe ,a low salaam,&#xD;
with a profundity and a malignant smile that cQuld only&#xD;
belong to Dr. Dodge. A vague presentiment of evil&#xD;
crossed my mind, and I turned in disgust to the duties&#xD;
of my new berth. By the time we got the anchors on&#xD;
the bows and the decks cleared up, it was blowing so&#xD;
freshly that Captain Beverly thought it prudent to reef&#xD;
topsails,-and now came my first trial. We were well&#xD;
out at sea, and the land was growing dim6 'The Whale-&#xD;
hunter pitched heavily in the angry sea. In common&#xD;
with others, I felt very decided symptoms of sea-sick-&#xD;
ness. Some had already gone below. One and an-&#xD;
other were looking astern, and murmuring "Good-bye&#xD;
to New Bedford!" when, with the voice of a young&#xD;
lion, the mate shouted-.~&#xD;
"Hands by the topsail halyards! Lower away!&#xD;
Man the topsail clewlines! Qlew down? Haul out&#xD;
the reef-tackles! Lay aloft there, and take a reef in&#xD;
the topsails! Two reefs there in the m izzen-topsail!&#xD;

"Bear a hand there, now I"'&#xD;
I bounded after a boat-steerer into the main-rigging,&#xD;
and followed him to the topsail-yard9 A faint, death-&#xD;
like sensation came over me as I crawled out on the&#xD;
toot-rope, and looked' down on the foaming sea. I was&#xD;
~t "the dog's ear," which is to say, next to the boat-&#xD;
steerer, who had the post of honour-the hearing, lie&#xD;
looked around at me as I was trying to assist him in&#xD;
hauling the sail out "to windward," and seeing how sick&#xD;
I was, he shouted fiercely-&#xD;
1''&#xD;
"Lay down! lay down, man.&#xD;
This was all Greek to me.&#xD;
"Go down on deck, you lubber! You ha'n't got the&#xD;
strength of a kitten! Laydown on deck, afore you&#xD;
fall overboard! If ye do fall, it's all day with ye! Lay&#xD;
down; I tell ye, lay down !"&#xD;
Amid i~i~ smiles of the captain, officers, and all the&#xD;
~id "sea-~gs," I crawled wearily to the lee-scuppers,&#xD;
and, in company with half-a-score of poor greenhorns,&#xD;
paid my matriculation fee by way of initiation into the&#xD;
occult mysteries of getting my "sea-legs." Of these&#xD;
I stood in most imperative need, as my limbs were of&#xD;

broiled codfish in its quintessential saitness, I drank&#xD;
sea-water--all to no purpose!&#xD;
* Anon the people were called aft, and the watches&#xD;
were formed. 'I was chosen in the captain's watch.&#xD;
Of this I was very glad, as I had taken a decided liking&#xD;
* to him. This accomplished, the order was given-&#xD;
*   "Go below, the starboard Watch," and I crawled for-&#xD;
ward, and descended the ladder into the dark forecastle.&#xD;
Oh, how sick I was! *Could I hut have died! And; to&#xD;
comfort me, a Yankee greenhorn, as sick as myself,&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIIL&#xD;
A Sun' is the world in miniature. Especially is this&#xD;
true of a man-of-war.-.-where, it has passed into a pro.&#xD;
verb, every man finds his level. The sailor whom you&#xD;
select for your hammock-boy may have been, in more&#xD;
prosperous days, a man ef wealth and distinction. The&#xD;
man who helps to pull you ashore in a cutter, or the&#xD;
dinghy, may have been a man of some eminence in pro-&#xD;
fessional life. You meet with men of ~li countries, and&#xD;
the most marked and startling contrast in .habits and&#xD;
character. In one man you find the mere a~nima4-&#xD;
dull, 'lifeless, soulless; a machine' almpst.~-not many&#xD;
degrees above the dray-horse, or the 'treadxnill-~-one&#xD;
whose brain is not often visited by ideas that are not on&#xD;
terms of the very closest intimacy with his rations of&#xD;
beef and grog and his watch below. In another you&#xD;
see the lubler, who trembles in' a whole-topsail breeze,&#xD;
and to whom the royal~yard. and the jib~boom are purga~&#xD;
tory. His messmater is the ambitious. man-who makes&#xD;
his way patiently, and step by step, from the rate of&#xD;
Johnny Raw to that of able seaman, captain of a top,&#xD;
or quarter-master. Another is the jovial "good fellow,"&#xD;
who can sing a good song, and spin a yarn as long as&#xD;
.the skysail-halyard~~whiling away ~a dreary night-&#xD;
watch of four hours, in .relating what' 'another zn~n&#xD;
would finish over a cup. of coffee. . Still another is your&#xD;
"heart of oak," who ,knows and does his duty; who,&#xD;
when other men~s cheeks blanch with terror~-~when the&#xD;
storm is at its height---when the face of~old ocean is white&#xD;
in his wrath-.and sail after sail is rent in shreds from the&#xD;
bolt-ropes--when, in the midst of rayless darkness, and&#xD;

firmly as Atlas or Gibraltar .at his post, in the face of&#xD;
almost certain death.&#xD;
But to my story.&#xD;
Night came on. Oh! that first night at sea! The&#xD;
ship plunged' and reared like a restive horse impatient&#xD;
of restraint. The sky w~s heavily overcast, and as&#xD;
'night settled upon the sea, rain added its raw discom-&#xD;
fort to the' accumulation of other diversities' of misery.&#xD;
At eight'o'clock, r. ~., just as, in utter weariness and&#xD;
exhaustion, "an exposition of sleep" came over me, I&#xD;
heard, in Cyclopian accents, at the scuttle--&#xD;
"Eight bells, there below!. Tumble up here, now!&#xD;
No sick4ist to-night! Come ~n deck, all of ye! D'ye&#xD;
hear, there ?"&#xD;
."Ay, ay, sir !" growled one of the few "old salts"&#xD;
who had shipped before the mast.&#xD;
The forecastle-lamp had gone out, and there was some&#xD;
delay and' a great' deal of swearing in lighting it.&#xD;
"Plague take the bloody' ole lamp !" exclaimed the&#xD;
doctor, (the cook,) who was waiting for Portuguese Peter&#xD;
to light it. It was lighted at last. I turned out. I&#xD;
found my jacket "over to leeward," and one of my&#xD;
shoes 'half-full of' lamp-'oil. With an heroic effort, how-&#xD;
'ever, I dressed and went on deck, the first of my watch.&#xD;
I could see nothing in the surrounding darkness, but I&#xD;
groped my way to the weather~rail, and staggeringly&#xD;
crawled aft.&#xD;
"-Come aft here! all of you 1" shouted the captain;&#xD;
and we were glad to 'get' out of the way of the floods&#xD;
of water that were dashing over the bows at every&#xD;
'plunge of th~ ship. Faint, sick, almost exhausted, I&#xD;
eroi~iched njider the weather bulwarks, somewhat alarm-&#xD;
~ed, if" the truth must be. said, by the loud, sharp thud&#xD;
of the swell against the bows, the quivering of the hull,&#xD;
and the creaking of the bulkheads. The gale abated,&#xD;
and we made sail to top-gallant sails. Wearily' passed&#xD;
the first long night-watch, and my heart ~leaped with&#xD;
'joy when the second mate (the captain had retired 'at&#xD;
'six bells) shouted-'&#xD;
&#xD;
LYNDE WEISS.&#xD;
&#xD;
115;&#xD;
&#xD;
"flight bells! Call, the watch !"&#xD;
"Go below, the wa tch !" was the order a few minutes&#xD;
later, and we wen~jielow. With a keen sense' of com-&#xD;
fort I crawled (how, I hardly know) into, my bertha&#xD;
With a miser-like consciousness. of my ability to sink&#xD;
instantly to sleep, I remember a coquettish delay to&#xD;
"Stretch the tired limbs"&#xD;
upon the Elysian downiness of my hay-bed. A thought&#xD;
of home and Jessie Grayson, and. Ii alept. I slept&#xD;
soundly. It was net yet seven bells in the mid watch&#xD;
when&#xD;
"Starboard watch, ahoy !" in a shrill m&#xD;
started me from a dream of home. , masculine yell,&#xD;
"All hands! A squall, hoys'! Make haste !"&#xD;
With a beating heart I bounded up the ladder. As&#xD;
I stepped U~QT1 deck, the wind took my very breath&#xD;
away, and I staggered into the lee-scuppers. I crawled&#xD;
with' some difficulty to windward. The rain was . pour~&#xD;
ing down in torrents, and the ship was heeled over&#xD;
almost on her beam-ends. The wind whistled fierce-&#xD;
ly through the 'rigging. The green hands stood in&#xD;
mut*e terror, utterly at loss where to go and what to&#xD;
do. The mate, I could readily see, was himself alarmed,&#xD;
and he was shouting' and Swearing, giving two or three&#xD;
Orders in a breath.&#xD;
I may remark here, in passing, that it is by no means&#xD;
uncommon for whalemen to sail from port with a crew&#xD;
in which there are not more than four Or five able Sea-&#xD;
men in the forecastle. Such was our own: predicament.&#xD;
Indeed, I doubt whether there was one in the Whale~&#xD;
hunter's forecastle who would have rated as an able&#xD;
seaman in the n~wchant-service or the navy.&#xD;
I now received my first lesson in the management of&#xD;
a 'ship. As I stood near the booby~hatch, unable to&#xD;
understand the orders of 'the mate, who was yelling like&#xD;
a hyena to the men, I saw dimly in the darkness the&#xD;
tall, manly form of Captain Beverly. He threw 'calmly&#xD;

a look aloft, and, in a tone of voice, little, if any, louder&#xD;
than his ordinary gruff, heavy accents, he said quickly,&#xD;
"Maints'gallant-y-ard, there ~"&#xD;
" Sir !"&#xD;
"Wha1~'~ the trouble with that sail ?"&#xD;
"The clewline 'a jammed, sir."&#xD;
"Mr. Pintle, see that clewline clear !"&#xD;
"Ay, ay, sir. All clear!"&#xD;
"Clew up I"&#xD;
"ATy, ay, sir I"&#xD;
"Hands by the topsail halyards! Lower away!&#xD;
Clew down! haul out the reef-tackles! Who's that at&#xD;
the wheel?"&#xD;
"Tom, sir."&#xD;
"Luff, half a point."&#xD;
"Ay, aysir. Luff it is."&#xD;
The ship was now safe. The squall abated, and we&#xD;
made sail again. I can never forget the calm, yet&#xD;
prompt and seamanlike style, in which Captain Beverly&#xD;
restored confidence to the men, and relieved the writhing&#xD;
spars of a strain that would have carried them by the&#xD;
board, had they not been of the best material and well&#xD;
stayed.&#xD;
It being our morning watch on deck, we scruJ~bed&#xD;
decks, (a new and very interesting operation to me,&#xD;
'which, in my greenness I supposed to be a sort of Sun-&#xD;
day scrub,) and made sail to royals. Of course, we had&#xD;
the forenoon watch below. I again sought my berth, as&#xD;
Aid several others, among whom was one David Lee, a&#xD;
-Dutohnian. The name, by-the-bye, I~as not a very&#xD;
Dutchish sound; but 'such was his sign-manual on the&#xD;
shipping-paper. Some of the watch preferred to remain&#xD;
awake. Some smoked.~ Some played cards. One&#xD;
sang, and Jim Hopper extorted notes from his rickety&#xD;
old violin, the shri1lnes~ of which would have forced&#xD;
~discord. herself to 'put her fingers to her ears. My&#xD;
phlegmatic friend bore the din very philosophically for&#xD;
a while; and then he said, in coaxing tone; to the&#xD;
&#xD;
117&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mein Gott, poys! it ish more noise as te tower uf&#xD;
Papel; unt it ish not Possible to schlep mit te noise.&#xD;
You acts like schuldren (children) !"&#xD;
In vain did he remonstrate. The card-players were&#xD;
staking plugs on plugs of tobacco&#xD;
merrily on. trumps ?" "I beg ' , and the game went&#xD;
!" "I'll give ye one !"&#xD;
"Whose's' deal ?" "Spades no more !" were among&#xD;
the expressions that met my drowsy ear. I slept at&#xD;
last. It could' not have been long; for 'when I awoke,&#xD;
the players were still intensely, engaged. My Dutch&#xD;
neighbour was smoking his pipe, and watching 'the gam-&#xD;
blers. At last they, too, turned in. The little fore-&#xD;
castle was still. The Dutchtnan's eyes were ~drawing&#xD;
drowsily together, when, suddenly, a rooster that had&#xD;
escaped from the hen-coop and 'strayed 'forward, 'set up,&#xD;
just ~t the scuttle, his very loudest and shrillest crow.&#xD;
The enraged Dutchman rose on one elbow, 'thrust his&#xD;
head out of his berth,' and, looking fiercely ~'p the scut-&#xD;
tle, he growled-.&#xD;
"Ach! by tam! are you there ?"&#xD;
A roar of laughter followed; but, at last, about six&#xD;
bells, the Dutchman snored, and broad chests around&#xD;
him also snored, and puffed, and "phew"-ed, and snorted&#xD;
in orchestral vigour and variety, in laughing at which&#xD;
I, too, slept and-.dreamed. I never snore.&#xD;
0 sleep! 0 dreams! your empire is at sea.. The&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
FLORES.-FAYAL.-LIFE AT 5EA.-THE FIGHT.&#xD;
FINE weather succeeded the storm. I recovered&#xD;
slowly from my sea-sickness; and, as I gre.w more ac-&#xD;
customed ~o my new home, I began to love the sea. So&#xD;
it is ever. A wise Providence has so formed us that,&#xD;
be our abiding-place where and what it may, we learn&#xD;
to love it. There is always, in every possible condition&#xD;
of lif~e, the relative good and evil, joy and sorrow,&#xD;
which settle 'into the ordinary share of happiness which&#xD;
falls to our lot. Panting beneath the equatorial sun,&#xD;
or shivering in polar snows, in freedom or in bondage,&#xD;
tl~ere is so nice an adjustment of the balance of joy and&#xD;
sorrow, that little ground is left for choice among the&#xD;
diversities of human condition. There is no shade of&#xD;
hardship or sorrow but has its corresponding intensity&#xD;
of comfort and delight. I loved my little berth. I cut&#xD;
engravings from the papers and magazines that had been&#xD;
given me, and pasted them upon its rough sides. I fitted&#xD;
it with a world of bachelor conveniences; and, were&#xD;
there no other tie, the animal luxury of the delicious&#xD;
sleep I enjoyed in it would have endeared it to me.&#xD;
I set myself at work to learn the names and uses of&#xD;
"the ropes." I was constantly looking aloft to see&#xD;
where the brftces, sheets, and . clewlines "led." I in-&#xD;
quired restlessly the names and ixses of every thing.&#xD;
I was the first among the green hands to take .a trick&#xD;
(alone) at the wheel; and Captain Beverly complimented&#xD;
me on my skill. When I was not "looking out" aloft,&#xD;
or at the ~wheel, I contrived to be at hand where the&#xD;
officers were fitting the boats, getting their "irons"&#xD;
(harpoons, spades, and lances) in order; or setting up&#xD;
&#xD;
rigging. In this way I learned a great deal of sailor&#xD;
lore in my first month at sea. The fourth mate, a-&#xD;
negro, was a huge, brawny fellow, and, by report, a&#xD;
good whalernan. Seeing my desire to learn, he took a&#xD;
special liking to me, and was never weary in answering,&#xD;
Again and again, my countless questions. I also took&#xD;
especial pains, on all occasions, to be first ~n executing&#xD;
an order. In bracing the yards, in making or taking&#xD;
in sail, in relieving the wheel or the look-out, it was&#xD;
my pride to be prompt, active, ever ready. This oh-&#xD;
tamed me the good-will of the captain and officers.&#xD;
The former would often call me aft to assist him in&#xD;
taking an observation; and the latter would select me&#xD;
from a knot of idlers to assist in working upon the&#xD;
rigging. What wonder I began to love the sea? ~ ay&#xD;
after day, in almost uninterrupted sunshine&#xD;
on towards the Azores.               , we bounded&#xD;
We had two passengers on board. They were Por-&#xD;
tuguese, and bound to Flores. As we drew nearer&#xD;
the islands, one of them (a gray-haired old man, who&#xD;
had been for many years away from his native islan4,)&#xD;
was in a fever of excitement. He. was constantly&#xD;
watching the binacle, and asking a thousand questions&#xD;
about the course, the latitude and longitude, and the&#xD;
rate of sailing. Indeed I began to share his excite-&#xD;
ment as we drew nearer Flores.&#xD;
Amid all the novelty, however, of life at sea, my&#xD;
thoughts would wander homeward. In the busy hours&#xD;
of the. day I could drive away such thoughts easily&#xD;
enough; but at twilight, in night watches, and in&#xD;
dreams, my fancy was ever busy with the scenes of&#xD;
home; and&#xD;
"My heart, untravelled,"&#xD;
sought a solace for the present in the recollections of&#xD;
the past. I remember that I lay down upon my chest&#xD;
one day, after dinner,, and fell asleep. I dreamed of&#xD;
home. I was at the well-remen~bered board, and&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
I&#xD;

&#xD;
around it were my father and his family, with good old&#xD;
Allan Grayson and his daughter. I was seated beside&#xD;
Jessie. It seemed to me, in my dream,, that I had won&#xD;
her heart' and hand, and that she looked blushingly at&#xD;
me as I recounted my hardships and adventures since I&#xD;
left my native village. Suddenly there was a ~pea1~ ofe&#xD;
thunder. Jove! how faithfully did my fancy recall&#xD;
the familiar features of every faGe, wearing a ~look of&#xD;
surprise at the sudden approach of the storm! Knives,&#xD;
forks, spoons, were dropped, and we looked now at one&#xD;
another, now at' the window, through which we could&#xD;
discern the vivid flashes of the lightning. 1V[y elysian&#xD;
dream was rudely interrupted by simon Nehemiah, the&#xD;
blacksmith, who bawled hoarsely in my ear-&#xD;
' ~I say, yaou! Weiss! Rowse out here! *Your trick&#xD;
at the wheel!"&#xD;
I bounded up the ladder, discovering, as I did so,&#xD;
that the cook was grinding coffee, and that he had thus&#xD;
~unintentionally furnished the thunder for my dream!&#xD;
"Land ho /" was 'the cry the next morning, and by&#xD;
noon we lowered the captain's boat and went ashore.&#xD;
Our,, passengers were half frantic, as well they might&#xD;
b'e, for Flores deserves its naine.. It is one of the most&#xD;
beautiful islands I have ever seen. True, it lacks the&#xD;
vegetation 'of the tropical islaiids of the South Sea; but&#xD;
then it is so well cultivated, that it looks like one vast&#xD;
floating garden, in the sea-approach. I could have&#xD;
kissed the earth, so delighted was I to see, once more,&#xD;
the beautiful green of broad fields, instead of the wide,&#xD;
monotonous expanse of sea and sky, on which I had&#xD;
gazed for the past fortiiight. I had become so much&#xD;
accustomed to the motion of the ship, that, at first, 1.&#xD;
could not walk on land without staggering.&#xD;
While the captain was busy in bargaining for a sup-&#xD;
ply of fresh provisions-potatoes, onions, fruit, ~iogs,&#xD;
and. chickens'-I pawned divers little superfluities for&#xD;
oranges. One ill-looking fellow, whose' "oomple~don"&#xD;
was "perfect gallows," singled me out for his victim,&#xD;
and, with wealth of smiles, and an urbanity that would&#xD;
&#xD;
have made him a prime favourite at court, he contrived&#xD;
to cheat me most villainously. There was a skill in&#xD;
his tactics which stamped him a great cheat. He might&#xD;
have sat for the portrait of Cool, in "London Assu-&#xD;
rance, and young Courtly's words might very appro~&#xD;
privately have been written beneath it: "There is a&#xD;
pungency about his invention and an originality in his&#xD;
equivocation that are perfectly refreshing !"&#xD;
We got our supplies on 'board, and sailed for Fayal.&#xD;
We stood off and on, while the captain went ashore.&#xD;
On his return we filled away, and, with a sigh, I bade&#xD;
farewell to beautiful Fayal. Years have passed, yet I&#xD;
still recall the beautiful Azores-.their hills, valleys,&#xD;
fields, groves, cascades, and neat white churches and&#xD;
cottages that decked the hillsides.&#xD;
I have neglected to say that, for some days pre-&#xD;
viously to our reaching the Western" Islands, there had&#xD;
been some ill4'eeling between the larboard and star-&#xD;
board, or mate's and captain's watches. As I have&#xD;
already stated, the greater part of the foremast hands&#xD;
were "green horns." Some of them complained viry&#xD;
bitterly of the noise, at night, over the forecastle, made&#xD;
unnecessarily by the watch on deck. There i#as very&#xD;
reasonable ground for complaint; though, for my own&#xD;
part, I was so weary with the labour of the day and&#xD;
my loss of accustomed sleep, that a national salute&#xD;
would not have waked me, except at the regular hour&#xD;
for calling the watch. Such is the case with all expe~&#xD;
rienced seamen. The watches retaliated upon eaeh&#xD;
other successively the real or imaginary wrongs of the&#xD;
last sleepless watch, until, 'at length, the quarrel' be-&#xD;
came general.&#xD;
One night, when we were running down the south-&#xD;
east trade-wind, one of the watch on deck came below,&#xD;
(I was in my birth,) and struck a light. It proved to&#xD;
be Simon Nehemiali, the blacksmith. He made so&#xD;
much noise and remained so long that he was sus-&#xD;
pected of trying to keep us awake.&#xD;

Brown sprang from his berth and struck the in~&#xD;

hd and the fight became general. They fought&#xD;
ruse below. The watch below bounded from their&#xD;
like tigers. The contest was at its height when there&#xD;
were three heavy raps on the scuttle, and Captain&#xD;
Beverly shouted-&#xD;
"Avast, there! Come on deck, all of you !"&#xD;
"We can't do it, sir," answered Brown.&#xD;
IAk# a lion springing upon his prey, the captain&#xD;
leaped into the forecastle. He was a man of enormous&#xD;
strength, and, striking right and left, he scattered the&#xD;
combatants as if they were children. I saw him throw&#xD;
four men headlong against the berths and bulkhead.&#xD;
"On deck I" shouted he, in a voice that might have&#xD;
roused the dead, and they obeyed him. He followed&#xD;
them, and went aft.&#xD;
"Sen'd Brown aft !" said he to the mate.&#xD;
"Ay~ ay, sir. Brown, lay aft here !"&#xD;
He came.&#xD;
~" Seize that man to the mizzen-rigging !"&#xD;
The order was obeyed.&#xD;
"Now, sir, what say you ?" said he to Brown.&#xD;
"Forgive me, sir !"&#xD;
"Cast off the lashings. I forgive ypu, but remem-&#xD;

noiselessly, a huge old spermaceti whale that lay with&#xD;
his back above the surface of the sea, reminding me, in&#xD;
the single glimpse I caught of it, of' the adventure of&#xD;
Sinbad the Sailor.&#xD;
When we left the ship, the fourth mate, who was hold..&#xD;
ing the steering-oar, constantly urged us to the greatest&#xD;
possible exertion, by such expressions as&#xD;
"Pull, my bullies! Will you pull! Weiss? What&#xD;
d'ye say, there? Sperm whale, boys! Do pull! Say&#xD;
you'll pull !"&#xD;
And while he steered with one hand, 'he aided our&#xD;
little after-oarsman with the other. lie had gradually.&#xD;
lowered his voice, as we drew near the whales, to a&#xD;
whisper.&#xD;
"There they are, boys! Sperm whales! Old set-&#xD;
tlers. Two hundred barrels apiece! Two years, and&#xD;
a full. ship! What's the news, now? lYil~ you pull ?"&#xD;
When within a few fathoms of the whale he had&#xD;
selected, he said in a low voice, to the boat-steerer,&#xD;
"Stand up, Ben! All ready! Stan' by, now,&#xD;
boys! One minute more! Softly! aive it to him,&#xD;
now, Ben!"&#xD;
The boat-steerer threw his harpoon with coolness and&#xD;
skill. We were "fast." The huge monster settled&#xD;
heavily down, threw his flukes (tail) lazily aloft, as if a.&#xD;
flea had annoyed him, and "sounded."&#xD;
"'Mind The line, there, boys !" shouted *the fourth&#xD;
mate. "Johnson, (the boat-steerer,) come aft, now."&#xD;
The boat-steerer (whose province it is to throw the&#xD;
harpoon, and who does' not steer' tb~e boat until after he&#xD;
has dane so) now took the steering-oar; and Mr.&#xD;
Butler took his place. By the time' he had taken the&#xD;
sheath, off' his well-polished lance, the whale ceased&#xD;
"sounding," and started for the surface. We peaked our&#xD;
oars, 'and hauled in the slack of the line. As soon as&#xD;
&#xD;
he' reached the surface, his spout' told us where lie lay,&#xD;
and we h*~uled the line rapidly inboard. When within&#xD;
a few~fathoms 'of him, Mr. -Butler threw his lance. It&#xD;
.struck the whale a little abaft the fin, and with his next.&#xD;
spout came the blood.&#xD;
"Spouts blood, boys~! lie's ours !" shouted the ex-&#xD;
cited mate. ~"Two hundred' bar..--JuMP, Weiss, fur&#xD;
your life I"&#xD;
I sprang instinctively from my seat, and was in the&#xD;
act of following Mr. Butler, who had' leaped overboard,&#xD;
when the tail of the huge monster struck the bow of the&#xD;
boat; giving me &amp;amp; blow that paralyzed one of my legs.&#xD;
I fell helplessly into the sea. ~The mate bad seen the&#xD;
occurrence, and he caught toy arm ;' supporting himself&#xD;
by clinging to the boat. The waist-boat happened to be&#xD;
nearest to us, and she- picked us up. By the time we&#xD;
were safely on board, the whale turned upon his side-.-&#xD;
dead. He was towed alongside, and secured by heavy&#xD;
"fluke chains" to the ship.&#xD;
Signals were then made to the other boats to return;&#xD;
but the officers' either could not or wonid not see, and&#xD;
they kept on 'in pursuit ef the whales. I can give the&#xD;
reader no' idea '(and he cannot form one adequately) of&#xD;
the intense excitement of suoh a chase. The race-course&#xD;
or the gambling-house may give some notion of it. One&#xD;
of the boats was "fast" to a young whale, (the young&#xD;
whales are always the most troublesome,) and he was&#xD;
dragging the boat at a fearful rate~ away from the ship.&#xD;
I barely caught a glimpse of her, as I was lifted ~on&#xD;
deck. I was carried below. Night came on. The&#xD;
doctor (the cook) reported 'to me that "de boats done&#xD;
gwine out o' sight, and de cap'n ben make a light ou do&#xD;
try-works."                              -~&#xD;
The boats did not reach the ship until t~ o'clock.&#xD;
The 'crew then shorte~ied sail, and preparations were&#xD;
made for "'cutting in." ~'I should but weary~the, reader&#xD;
by a detaile4 description of the process which~ has ~alr~eady&#xD;
been ~o 6 "~d~scribed. The fires were soon kindled;&#xD;

were got on deck, and the work of the "whaling-&#xD;
ground" was fairly begun. Though suffering much&#xD;
pain from the blow I had received, I crawled to the&#xD;
scuttle, and looked out upon deck. The officers and&#xD;
men were gathered around the try-works, the blaze of&#xD;
the fires throwing their forms into clear, relief against&#xD;
the surrounding darkness. The smoke was whirling&#xD;
away in huge volumes, to leeWard, and hundreds of&#xD;
storm-petrels were chattering in our wake.&#xD;
We cruised in that region for several days. During&#xD;
that time the severe pain I suffered brought on a fever,&#xD;
by which I was so much reduced~tIiat Captain Beverly&#xD;
decided to touch at Rio Janeiro, and leave me for medi-&#xD;
cal treatment. It was desirable, moreover, to touch at&#xD;
that port, in order to send home the oil we had taken,&#xD;
amounting to some two hundred and seventy barrels.&#xD;
This was obtained from the large whale captured'by the&#xD;
fQurth mate, an&amp;amp; two smaller ones subsequently taken&#xD;
by the larboard and bow boats.&#xD;
On arriving at Rio Janeiro, Captain Beverly placed me&#xD;
under the care of the consul, to whom hegave my pass-&#xD;
port, and said to me that he proposed to cruise for a&#xD;
month off Rio Janeiro. If, at the expiration of that&#xD;
period, I should be able to resume my berth, he would&#xD;
reserve' it for me. If not, the consul would find me a&#xD;
passage home. The month passed. The Whale-hunter&#xD;
returned; but I was yet an invalid, and I sorrowfully&#xD;
watched the brave ship as she sailed past the Sugar-&#xD;
loaf and disappeared. A few days later I took passage&#xD;
'on board the barque Julia, of Salem, for the United&#xD;
States. We had a pleasant passage of fifty days. It&#xD;
was on a cold, raw, cheerless day in February that we&#xD;
landed. Of the money left in the hands of the consul&#xD;
formeby Captain Beverly, I had fifteen dollars iemain-&#xD;
ing. I went to a sailor's boarding-house, and, as I laid&#xD;
my head upon my pillow, my heart throbbed fiercely&#xD;
;w hen I asked myself what L should do. Go home?&#xD;
'Never! unless in better plight than I was at that time.&#xD;
Of' course, I must get employment. But how? where?&#xD;
&#xD;
127&#xD;
&#xD;
I was not yet sufficiently restored to be capable of hard&#xD;
labour. Should I try to get a situation as a teacher?&#xD;
Alas! I 'was an utter stranger, and I had not a single'&#xD;
letter of recommendation. I spent several days in the&#xD;
invention and consideration of different plans of action.&#xD;
All to no purpose. Sick, disheartened, despairing, I&#xD;
left the boarding-house one evening, for a walk on the&#xD;
beach. I crossed the bridge, and walked towards.Mar-&#xD;
blehead. On my - return I stopped at the wharves,&#xD;
where a little fleet of "jiggers" and "pinkeys" (fish-&#xD;
ing-vessels) were lying side by side. As I stood gazing&#xD;
at them, I saw a bright-eyed Yankee girl busily engagedd&#xD;
in cooking supper for the crew. She looke&amp;amp; search-&#xD;
ingly at me for a moment, and I fancied that there was&#xD;
a gleam of sympathy in her dark eye, asshe said-&#xD;
"Come aboard, friend! ~Come on deck a minute,&#xD;
John 1" added she, turning towards the cabin-doors.&#xD;
"Here's a craft in distress, or I'm no prophet. Come&#xD;
aboard! come aboard! You're as welcome as a fair&#xD;
wind !"&#xD;
I complied with the request.&#xD;
"On a lee shore, shipmate ?" asked the ~man, (the&#xD;
captain, as I soon discovered.)&#xD;
"Yes !"&#xD;
"Wal, walk below. John Manchester's my name. I&#xD;
command this jigger, the Norma. 12iet me make you&#xD;
acquainted with my wife."&#xD;
I bowed..&#xD;
"What may I call your name&#xD;
I-gave it.&#xD;
" Wal, that's strait forward. I like your looks. Mal~e&#xD;
yourself tew hum. To-morrow, ef I kin dew, any thing&#xD;
for ye, why jest say 80. Stop aboard with ua~to~night."&#xD;
I acc~pte4 the invitation. We had some little chat&#xD;
the next morning, while breakfast was in preparation,&#xD;
about matters of general interest; in which, with gen-&#xD;
tlemanlike delicacy, the captain asked me no questions&#xD;
touching my history, or my existing embarrassments;&#xD;
After breakfast, we walked. As we passed ray board~&#xD;

ing-house, on our return, he again invited me to go on&#xD;
board the Norma.&#xD;
"Are you a fisherman ?" I asked, as I took his hand,&#xD;
to bid him good morning..&#xD;
"Yes; amack'reler."&#xD;

He left me, 'and I entered the boarding-house. The&#xD;

I could find. At nightfall, weary, dispirited, unde-&#xD;

"iHallo! Strike me surprised! if it a'n't-~---no, it.&#xD;

"Then you hadn't heerd, from home lately?"&#xD;
"I've just returned from Rio Janeiro."&#xD;
"Wal, your father's mighty poorly. They've written&#xD;

"Indeed! How are-how (I longed' to ask about&#xD;
Jessie) are the rest?"'&#xD;
"Oh, all well."&#xD;
"How is your friend Frank Gibson ?"&#xD;
"Bright as a~lark. Speaking' of Frank, do you know&#xD;

"How?"&#xD;
"Why, a tall, 'black-lookin', mysterious chap came to&#xD;
Boylston 'bout three months ago,' scraped acquaintance&#xD;
with'Parson Grayson, took a class in the Sunday-school,&#xD;
and now he's hand and glove at the parsonage."&#xD;
"Is he-does-------that is to say, is Miss Grayson&#xD;
pleased with him ?"&#xD;
"Wal, some say so; some think not."&#xD;
"Do you think so?"&#xD;
"You're too hard on me, Lynde. Do you know, I&#xD;

however, decided me at once. I went to my boarding-&#xD;

"ilallo, Lynde! how are ye now?"&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
THE JOURNEY HOMEWARD.&#xD;
THERE was. a raw, frosty chilliness in the air, that&#xD;
quickened my footsteps, as I set out on my' long jour-&#xD;
ney. It was the last of September. There had been,&#xD;
already, several frosts;. and the woods that skirted the&#xD;
road had put on their many-coloured garb of crimson&#xD;
and yellow and brown. These shades were thrown&#xD;
beautifully into relief by the dark foliage of the native&#xD;
spruce, cedar, hemlock, and pine, which abound in the&#xD;
interior of New England. I passed through Nashua,&#xD;
Keene, Walpole, Bellows' Falls, and other towns, on the&#xD;
much-travelled stage-route, taking the southern~ pass&#xD;
through the Green Mountains, through Rutland.&#xD;
Despite the circumstances under which I w~ return-&#xD;
ing home, every hour's travel lightened my burden of&#xD;
care and anxiety. I suppose that I must have travelled,&#xD;
one day with another, about twenty miles a day. Occa-&#xD;
sionally, my pride rebelled against my resolution to go&#xD;
home in* my sailor garb; but I mastered the feeling;&#xD;
consoling myself, to some extent, to say the truth, with&#xD;
the thought that my unshorn hair and beard, together&#xD;
with the hronzed complexion I had acquired at aea,&#xD;
would prevent immediate recognition. At Rutland I&#xD;
encountered a somewhat serious difficulty; none other&#xD;
than he utter exhaustion of my little stock of~inoney.&#xD;
I pondered long upon the means of relief. I had re-&#xD;
solved that I would not, under any circumstances, write&#xD;
home for money. Should I beg? Could I? I walked&#xD;
until noon, when, weary beyond expression, I sat down&#xD;
on a log by the wayside. A careful examination of my&#xD;
pockets brought to light a solitary shilling. With this&#xD;
I stopped at the door of the first farm-house; and,&#xD;
having eaten my bowl of bread and milk, offered the&#xD;
coin Vo the good housewife.&#xD;

&#xD;
"No, sir! we don't take money for trifles like this.&#xD;
You seem worn out-almost sick. Stay, won't you?&#xD;
Remain here until morning.,, Have you far to go ?"&#xD;
"About a hundred miles.&#xD;
"Well, you will accomplish the distance quite as&#xD;
soon if you remain here to-night."&#xD;
I thanked her, but declined the kind invitation, and&#xD;
told her of the urgency of my journey. Her gentle&#xD;
eyes glistened as she said good-bye, and my voice re~&#xD;
fused all utterance, as, with the hot tears on my own&#xD;
cheek; I pressed the extended hand, and resumed my&#xD;
journey. As I left the house, it began to rain. From&#xD;
an impalpable drizzle it grew to a cold, raw, easterly&#xD;
storm, that beat ruthlessly upon me as I trudged, with&#xD;
aching limbs, towards home. At length, after many a&#xD;
weary hour's travel, night came on. There was no&#xD;
dwelling in sight. The rain had ceased falling-and,&#xD;
exhausted by the day's travel, I went into the woods&#xD;
by the roadside, broke a quantity of boughs from the&#xD;
low hemlocks, an d stretched my tired limbs for a night's&#xD;
repose.&#xD;
I slept. When I awake it was broad day. I was&#xD;
covered with the yellow, withered leaVes. I shivered&#xD;
with cold-.--and, on attempting to rise, I was almost&#xD;
frantic with the stinging, aching, nerve-palsying pain&#xD;
that besieged every joint. Any one who has travelled&#xD;
through those regions of southern and western Ver-&#xD;
mont, where the prevailing soil is clay, especially if he&#xD;
have done so after a protracted "spell" of rainy wea-&#xD;
ther, will readily understand how slowly and pa~ifully&#xD;
I forced my way onward through the yielding, slippery,&#xD;
glue-like mud. A hot, feverish feeling succeeded the&#xD;
death-like chilliness I had experienced when I awoke,&#xD;
and I was on the point of yielding in despair to the&#xD;
feeling of utter helplessness and hopelessness, when I&#xD;
heard behind me the dull tramp of a horse. I did not&#xD;
turn my head. I discovered, however, as his large, un-&#xD;
wieldy horse trotted past me, that it was a man on&#xD;
horseback. He was a hearty, ruddy, good~humoured&amp;amp;&#xD;
&#xD;
looking man of forty-five. I observed that he eyed me&#xD;
with a somewhat keen glance of scrutiny as he passed.&#xD;
I did not speak, however-contenting myself with the&#xD;
mental ejaculation-&#xD;
"Jove! had I but a mule I"&#xD;
He must have been a reader of faces, for he checke~1?&#xD;
his horse, and said-.&#xD;
"So you'd like to ride, eh.?"&#xD;
"Yes. I'd give the world to ride."&#xD;
"You shall keep your .share of the world, and have&#xD;
the ride besides."&#xD;
"While you walk ?"&#xD;
"Ay. I've a frame of iron. You're. as frail as a&#xD;
girl; and there are girl's tears ready to overflow your&#xD;
cheeks, now. Pshaw! Cheer up, man. Here! put&#xD;
your foot in the stirrup. What! you can't? Well&#xD;
then, this will do as well, I take it." And, so saying, he&#xD;
lifted me, as I would have lifted an infant, into the saddle.&#xD;
"'Never look sad; nothing's so bad&#xD;
As getting familiar with sorrow;&#xD;
Treat him, to-day, in a cavalier way,&#xD;
And he'll seek other quarters to-morrow!"'&#xD;
continued my companion, as we jogged along.&#xD;
"Where do you live ?" he asked.&#xD;
"In' Boylston." -&#xD;
"Across the hake ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Do you know George Weiss ?"&#xD;
"I'm his son.&#xD;
"~'ou? his son?"&#xD;
" Yes.~,&#xD;
"W-h-e-w !" (A long w1~istle of 8UTprz8e.) "Why,&#xD;
how came you in this plight ?"&#xD;
I told him.&#xD;
"Well, I'm as glad as if I'd discovered the north-&#xD;
west passage. Your father did me a kind turn when I&#xD;
was a boy, and I've a chance now to pay him a small-&#xD;
instalment. Hurrah !" 12&#xD;

And he threw his hat high into the air, in a somewhat&#xD;
Irish dernonstratioii of his eminent satisfaction.&#xD;
"There's the lake; see it ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"And there's my house. You will stay there with&#xD;

"I can't possibly."&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
"Why, father is ill."&#xD;
"Ah !~ tluia indeed? That alters the case. By-the-&#xD;

"I will be your debtor, so please you, for a shil-&#xD;

".Yoi~'li take supper with the Great Mogul as much.&#xD;

And again he p~offe~ed me the notes.&#xD;
"No, sir; only a shilling, if you please."&#xD;
"You're, an obstinate cub. There's a dollar. If&#xD;
you won't take that, you may swim the lake for me."&#xD;
I laughed as I dismounted.&#xD;
"That laugh's a good sign. I'll see you agt~in, ere&#xD;
long. Good-bye. God bless you !"&#xD;
And, with a hearty shake of the hand, he left me.&#xD;
It was about four in the afternoon when I found' my-&#xD;
self on the western shore of Lake Champlain, a little&#xD;
to the south of Crown Point. I made my way to the&#xD;
black, craggy mountain that rises at the head of Bull-&#xD;
waggy Bay, (" Oh! the names that things take on!"),&#xD;
bounded u~ its side, and, urging my way rapidly on-&#xD;
ward, reached Port Henry at twilight. A night's rest&#xD;
gave me new energy-and, as the sun rose the next&#xD;
&#xD;
morning, I began my last day's travel. It was but&#xD;
twenty-five miles-and though it was the Sabbath, I&#xD;
hurried on towards home. The sun had just set 'as I&#xD;
reached the brow of the hill from which you descend as&#xD;
you approach Boylston from the south. J~ leaving the&#xD;
highway, I walked slowly along in the thicket that&#xD;
crested the Ledge, (it is cut down now,) until I was op-&#xD;
posite the hQme of Jessie Grayson. In my "fulness&#xD;
of heart," I knelt upon the green swatd, bared my tem-&#xD;
pies to the cool west wind that swept down from the&#xD;
mountains, and thanked God that I once more behehl&#xD;
my native village. I arose, and Walked slowly home-&#xD;
ward-when, suddenly, in a cluster of huge pines, IL&#xD;
saw the gleam of a white dress. I heard the sound of&#xD;
voices, as I drew nearer to the spot-and, as I ap-&#xD;
proached still nearer, I heard, in tones that I could not&#xD;
mistake, the words-&#xD;
"Leave me, sir. It is not yet your privilege to corn-.&#xD;
mand."&#xD;
A tall form was just visible in a retreat through the&#xD;
neighboring underwood. Whose it was I needed no&#xD;
special revelation to inform me.&#xD;
"Jessie !" saidJ, as she turned to go home..&#xD;
"Dear Lynde! is it you ?" she exclaimed-and she&#xD;
gave me both her hands. "Oh, I was so frightened!&#xD;
I"&#xD;
She stopped, suddenly.&#xD;
"Where have you been, Mr. Weiss? When did you&#xD;
return ?"&#xD;
"Mr. Weiss ?" I echoed bitterly.&#xD;
"Forgive me, Lynde. I know not what to say. You&#xD;
would pity me, if you knew all."&#xD;
"All, Jessie? What is it ?"&#xD;
"I have promised to tell no one."&#xD;
"But you can explain all by-and4iy ?"&#xD;
She shook her head.&#xD;
"it is time I was at home, Lynde. ])o net think&#xD;
hardly of me."&#xD;
"Think hardly of you? Do you still reject n~e?"&#xD;

"I must."&#xD;
"Then you love me, Jessie.' You"-&#xD;
"When Miss Grayson requires your special attention,&#xD;
sir," said some one at my elbow," we will very grate-&#xD;
fully avail ourselves of your kind' assistance. At the&#xD;
present time, you will excuse me for saying that she is&#xD;
not in need of your services."&#xD;
"Father !" exclaimed Jessie, reproachfully.&#xD;
"Come, my daughter. It is time you were in-doors.&#xD;
I hoped that your knowledge of this young man's pro-&#xD;
fligacy' '--&#xD;
"Profligacy, Mr. Gr~yson? Profligacy, did you say?&#xD;
How, and when, and where ?"&#xD;
"I did say profligacy, sir; and I beg to~ add that I&#xD;
meant it. Good-bye, sir I"&#xD;
I heard a stifled sob, as they left me; and I sank&#xD;
wearily down upon the earth, heart-sick, despairing--&#xD;
as one bereaved. I remained there-I know not how&#xD;
long-until a thought of my father nerved me with new&#xD;
energy. I rose hastily and strode homeward.&#xD;
At the northern extremity of the Ledge was an enor-&#xD;
mous pine. Next the path, it had the appearance of&#xD;
being seund; but the northern side ~of it had been so&#xD;
much burned as to leave a large cavity, still black and&#xD;
charred, as it had been for years. As I passed it, a&#xD;
slight rustle in the leaves arrested my attention. I&#xD;
turned, but saw nothing; and thinking that it was the&#xD;
wind stirring the dry leaves, I paused a moment and&#xD;
looked over the village. It was, as far as I could see,&#xD;
unchanged. It was now quite dark, and thelights were&#xD;
gleaming che~rful1y from many a remembered window.&#xD;
"Oh, my father! is it thus I come home to you?"&#xD;
said I aloud; "in rags, penniless; you wellnigh as&#xD;
poor, spirit-broken, ill? Pshaw! This is mere boyish&#xD;
whining. There are no difficulties in your path which&#xD;

"DEan !" hissed a voice fiercely in nay ear. A&#xD;
sharp, burning; stinging sensation caused me to put my&#xD;
hand to my side, as I turned to discover the. persoti&#xD;
whose footsteps I heard in the underwood, and the warm&#xD;
blood gushed forth from the wound. I remember' &amp;amp;&#xD;
feeling of dizziness and nausea, and a rnomentar~ sens6&#xD;
of pain, as I fell upon some l6ose stones at the foot of the&#xD;
pine. The assassin had done his work with some skill.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXJJ.&#xD;
~iLOME, AS I FOUND IT-A VISIT TO PAULA WARREN-THE&#xD;
CIRCLE BROKEN.&#xD;
I hAVE a dim recollection, as of a dream which I can&#xD;
but half recall,. in the bustle, of the day's toil, of a dark-&#xD;
ened room; of white, fringed curtains; the form and&#xD;
proportions of which evaded my efforts to define them;&#xD;
now distinct and natural, and then vague, shadowy, im-&#xD;
palpable. I remember closing my eyes with a sigh of&#xD;
exhaustion at the fruitless effort. I remember hearing&#xD;
my name pronounced by a familiar voice ~ and after&#xD;
that is another chaos. When my consciousness was&#xD;
again restored, I remember feeling an accession of&#xD;
strength. I could see nabre distinctly. I raised my&#xD;
hands, and looked at them.. And them I asked myself&#xD;
where I was, and how I came to be' in that particular&#xD;
room. Turning my head, I saw, hanging against the&#xD;
wail, a barQmeter and an 'old military chapean; one&#xD;
F   of which articles I recognized as my father's; the other&#xD;
as my brother Griffith's. The key was found, and I&#xD;
soon recalled the incidents of my return to Boylston.&#xD;
On a light stand, b.y the bedside, were divers cups and&#xD;
phials; and among them was an ancient-looking silver-&#xD;
12*.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
bowed pair of spectacles, with a much-faded crimson-&#xD;
morocco case, which I at once remembered as the pro-&#xD;
perty of my aunt. I was wondering why I had been&#xD;
left 'alone; and was about to make an effort to call some.&#xD;
one of the family, (it would have been fruitless,) when I&#xD;
heard a light footstep at my bedside. Oh, how my pulse&#xD;
leaped as I turned my eyes! There, pale, sad-ill, to&#xD;
all appearance-stood the idol of my life-long worship.&#xD;
Lying, as I did, in deep shadow, she did not discover&#xD;
that I had opened my eyes. She looked down upon&#xD;
the phials and cups that covered the light stand, and&#xD;
sighed.&#xD;
"Jessie !" I said, in a hoarse whisper.&#xD;
"Lynde! do you know me ?" she exclaimed.&#xD;
"How long"-&#xD;
"Hist! not a word! The doctor says you must not&#xD;
attempt to talk. Thank God! he's saved !" she mur-&#xD;
inured; and, bowing her head, she wept. A moment&#xD;
afterward she left me. She returned with my father,&#xD;
Griffiths, and my sisters.&#xD;
"My dear boy !". murmured my father. "God bless&#xD;
you! You have had a narrow escape. There, don't&#xD;
try to say any thing.. Keep perfectly quiet, and we'll&#xD;
have you up in a few days."&#xD;
My aunt Caroline, Ann West, and my uncle Hugh&#xD;
came in as h~e enjoiiwd me to bequiet; and as I looked,&#xD;
in almost infantile weakness, at the familiar faces, there&#xD;
were tears answering the hysteric flow of my own.,&#xD;
"Leave him now," said my father. "Brother Hugh&#xD;
wilL sit with 'him awhile, until Dr. Blair returns.&#xD;
They left me. Wearied by even so slight an exertion,&#xD;
I again sank into a profound slumber. When I awoke&#xD;
again, the doctor was at my bedside, and near~ him&#xD;
stood the clergyman, Allan Grayson.&#xD;
~"Getting stronger, you -see," said tJ~e doctor to his&#xD;
companion. -'&#xD;
"Oh, decidedly," was the reply.'&#xD;
"Well, Lynde, you have had a~ pretty sick time of it.&#xD;
You're doing nicely, I see. Let me caution you to be&#xD;
&#xD;
quiet. Don't speak to an~oc1~,', for a day or two yet.&#xD;
II suppose you are lonely; tired, eli ?"&#xD;
Nodded.&#xD;
"Well, Griffiths may read Robinson Crusoe to you.&#xD;
Here's Lucy and Jessie, though; we'll press them into&#xD;
service. Here, Jessie! read this forlorn young gentle-&#xD;
man a full, true, and particular account of Robinson&#xD;
Crusoe's sickness, and his grand tobacco panacea.&#xD;
Come, friend Grayson, the ladies are the best nurses,&#xD;
you know. Here comes Kate; and, if the three can't&#xD;
cure him, he's beyond my skill. Ha! ha! ha! Don't&#xD;
have the dumps, my boy! You won't die, this time !"&#xD;
And the gentlemen left me. With the gentle. minis-&#xD;
trations of home, I recovered apace; and in a week I'&#xD;
was able to sit in my father's arm-chair. Paul Warren&#xD;
and his family were among my first visitors. My old&#xD;
playfellows and neighbours came in as soon as the&#xD;
medical ta6oo was removed; and their friendly sympa~&#xD;
thy removed the unpleasant thoughts of my unexpected&#xD;
arrival and my 'penniless condition.&#xD;
My uncle Hugh relieved me one day of a burthensome&#xD;
anxiety, by quietly telling me that my father's~ creditors,&#xD;
on a careful examination of his affairs, were so well&#xD;
pleased with his upright dealing, and so thoroughly&#xD;
satisfied of his ability to pay all he owed, that they had&#xD;
given him "an extension." The price of iron and lum-&#xD;
ber, he added, had recently risen with a rapidity and&#xD;
to an~ extent almost without precedent, and my father&#xD;
did not, at that moment, owe five hundred dollars. The&#xD;
rise in the value of real estate had been very consider..&#xD;
able;' and his property, real and personal, would com-&#xD;
mand fifty thousand dollars.&#xD;
At last, after an interval of some' three weeks, I could&#xD;
walk. With my father and my. uncle Hugh, or ~with&#xD;
Griffiths and my sisters,-occasionally with the house-&#xD;
keeper and Jessie 'Grayson.-.J strolled languidly through&#xD;
the garden and into the fields. On one occasion, as we&#xD;
were passing Fogg &amp;amp; Gibson's store, Barney Fogg&#xD;
rushed to my side.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC8062-00000074"/>&#xD;
140              LYNDE WEISS.                                          LYNDE WEISS.             141&#xD;
&#xD;
"Hallo! Lynde! Got out ag'in, eh? 'Pon my&#xD;
word, I thought you'd a-died. Who do you 'spose it was&#xD;
that struck ye ?"&#xD;
Griffiths: checked the. flow of Mr. Barney Fogg's short&#xD;
sentences, and we walked home.&#xD;
"Do you know who struck you, Lynde ?" asked&#xD;
Griffiths.&#xD;
"No."&#xD;
"But you suspect."&#xD;
"We'll talk of that by-and-by, Griffiths."&#xD;
The recollection of this conversation was speedily&#xD;
banished by the occurrences of* the next few weeks. I&#xD;
now remember---what I did not then notice---that no al-&#xD;
lusion was made to the occurrences connected with my&#xD;
return. Besides, there was a great deal to absorb my&#xD;
attention from day to day. I had no sooner recovered&#xD;
than I re~risited my home among the mountains. The&#xD;
lapse of a year~ and a half, though its effects were not&#xD;
noticeable in Pauk and Mary Warren, had effected a&#xD;
decided change in Charles, who was one of the lustiest&#xD;
and most active among my father's lumbermen, and in&#xD;
young P~aul, who, by dint of persevering study, had&#xD;
succeeded in passing a very creditable examination at&#xD;
a neighboring college, and was then winning golden&#xD;
opinions from the faculty and the students. It was on&#xD;
the very day of my visit that his mother had received a&#xD;
letter from him. She had scarcely ended her eager&#xD;
inquiries as to my fortunes during my absence, when,&#xD;
with .a mother's joy swelling her heart and speaking in&#xD;
her eloquent eye, she placed it in my hand, with the&#xD;
simple announcement-&#xD;
"From Paul." -&#xD;
I opened it, and. read as follows:&#xD;
"M-, December 21st, 18-.&#xD;
"My DEAR MOTHER :-I shall be with you at Christ-&#xD;
nias. The days are dragging their length very tediously&#xD;
away, as you may well imagine, but the day after to-&#xD;
&#xD;
morrow will set me free, and then, dear mother, I shall&#xD;
soon be with you. Rejoice with me. Although I am&#xD;
the, youngest of' my class, I have been elected to the&#xD;
censorship of the literary society to which I belong. I&#xD;
am so fortunate, too, as. to have pleased the president&#xD;
and faculty, and they speak-somewhat vaguely, to be&#xD;
sure, but definitely enough to set my heart bounding&#xD;
like that of a thorough-bred in a fox-hunt---of good news&#xD;
for me, which will not be very tardy in coming. Be-&#xD;
sides, (and I say this because you will be glad of it,) the&#xD;
little trifle I wrote in the summer vacation has received&#xD;
the most flattering comments from the editor of -'s&#xD;
Magazine, and it recently came to me in an English re-&#xD;
print. Oh, if I can but succeed! dear, dear mother. I&#xD;
thank God that I yet have a mother. How will I con-&#xD;
jure up a spell that shall relieve grim poverty of her&#xD;
long and unthanked sentinelship at your door? Do&#xD;
you know, I am proud, and that I 8tep proudly when&#xD;
I pass the starched and gloved, fashion-aping nonenti.&#xD;
ties-the rich votaries of science-in my class, who&#xD;
only know geometry from the differential calcu&#xD;
the title-pages of their text-books?     lus by&#xD;
"How are you all at home? Oh, I am 80 impatient to&#xD;
see you! My books grow irksome to me as the time&#xD;
draws near; but, for all that, I am early and late at my&#xD;
toil. Ii fret a little at this long, probationary study, for&#xD;
I long to do something; yet my better judgment says,&#xD;
'Wait. Be patient. Lay deeply and firmly the founda-&#xD;
tion; and you've a. lifetime to uproar what superstruc-&#xD;
ture you will.' Enough; I must take my book8 in&#xD;
hand. Give my love to all. Give Sue &amp;amp; kiss for me;&#xD;
and accept a missive thousand for yourselffrom&#xD;
"Your affectionate son,&#xD;
"PAUL."&#xD;
He arrived on the following day.. Decided as was&#xD;
the change in himself arid Charles, I was surprised by&#xD;
the greater alteration in the appearance of his sisters.&#xD;

Ruth was now twenty, and was, as I soon learned, soon&#xD;
to be married. Mary and Judith were like their elder&#xD;
sister, fine-looking girls, nearly grown, and. great&#xD;
favourites among the young folk at the Falls. Amidst&#xD;
some idle badinage with Ruth about her approaching&#xD;
nuptials, I noticed that a shade Qf unpleasant feeling&#xD;
clouded the features of the mother, while Judith hung&#xD;
her head with a deep blush. Paul happened to come in,&#xD;
however, at that moment, from his work, and the inci-&#xD;
dent was forgotten. The young student, too, arrived&#xD;
that evening, and, in the joy of our greetings, I should&#xD;
not probably have given the matter a second thought,&#xD;
had not an occasional look of deep sadness and some&#xD;
long-drawn sighs recalled it. I was at once satisfied&#xD;
that Judith had given her heart's wealth away. To&#xD;
whom, was a question for time to answer.&#xD;
The Christmas holidays went merrily by, and, at the&#xD;
urgent request of Paul Warren, I consented to prolong&#xD;
my visit until after New-year's. ~oung Paul was then&#xD;
to leave us, to take charge of a country school, and~&#xD;
Charles was to return with hjs father ~to the Lumber-&#xD;
men's Lodge. The da~ys went merrily by. The young&#xD;
farmer tQ whom Ruth was betrothed came on the day&#xD;
after Christmas, and, what with musie, dancing, and&#xD;
sleigh-rides, there were few~dull moments for the happy&#xD;
occupants of the cabin. New-year's came.&#xD;
"You must excuse me this morning, Lynde," said&#xD;
Paul, as we left the breakfast-table. "I've a few loads&#xD;
of wood to haul to-day, and by-andby, if you have no-&#xD;
thing better to do, why, cross the old rye~fleld, and&#xD;
eome into the clearing where I am chopping. 12 shall&#xD;
commence hauling in time to get home with a load of&#xD;
wood at dinner-time. Good morning !"&#xD;
"Good morning, Paul," I replied; and, as he turned&#xD;
away with his ch&amp;amp;~erfuI sTmile, his eyes flashing with&#xD;
good4humour and beaming with kindness, his hearty&#xD;
ringing tones falling welcomely upon other ears be-&#xD;
sides~ my own, I sighed, as I silently asked myself if&#xD;
&#xD;
LYNDE WEISS.               143&#xD;
I too should, ever have such a home, with such an&#xD;
angel-wife to gladden it with heaven's own joy and&#xD;
peace.&#xD;
The morning wore away. Charles accompanied John&#xD;
Williams, the young farmer, to the Falls, while I sallied&#xD;
forth with- young Paul through the snow towards the&#xD;
clearing.&#xD;
"Father must be loading," said Paul, as we left the&#xD;
rye-field a~d entered the narrow thicket that separated&#xD;
it from the place to which we were going. "I don't&#xD;
hear the axe. It seems early, though, for him to begin&#xD;
hauling."&#xD;
We soon came in sight of the cattle. They were&#xD;
standing quietly beside a large pile of wood.&#xD;
"Your father has gone to the brook for water, pos-&#xD;
~ibly," I remarked, as we approached the sleds "No,&#xD;
here he is! He is hurt, Paul."&#xD;
We both sprang forward. There, stretched at full&#xD;
length, face downward, in the deep snow, lay Paul&#xD;
Warren.&#xD;
"Paul!" Iexclaimed, as I grasped the collar of his&#xD;
coat, and attempted to raise him.&#xD;
"Father!" screamed my companion, hoarsely. There&#xD;
was no reply, no motion. The limbs were~ stiff. Th~&#xD;
face was ghastly, and the eyes set. He was DEAD! He&#xD;
lay as he fell. There was not a vestige of the slightest&#xD;
struggle. We knelt in the snoW beside him. We chafed&#xD;
his hands and temples. We loosened his clothing, and&#xD;
rubbed the broad chest with snow. We be~ught him&#xD;
to speak, to. give some sign. Alas! alas! Wo to the*&#xD;
widow and orphans-he was dead!.&#xD;
*            *             *      .     *&#xD;

when&#xD;
"Women's tears fell fast,&#xD;
And children sobbed aloud,"-&#xD;
the dull clatter of the clods upon the coffin-the closing&#xD;
prayer and benediction,-afld the sad return to the&#xD;
broken circle of the home-fire! I am unequal to the&#xD;
task. My eyes are dim these many years, andy 'the&#xD;
thin locks are snow-white upon my~ temples; yet the&#xD;
dim eyes wax never so nearly sightless, and an old&#xD;
man's weary loneliness never comes with such heart-&#xD;
sinking ~weight, as when I recall those sorrow-darkened&#xD;
days of my younger years. "So may he rest !"&#xD;

"Let us be patient; these severe afflictions&#xD;
Not from the ground arise ~&#xD;
But oftentimes celestial benedictions&#xD;
Assume this dark disguise."&#xD;
So writes one whose tone betrays that he has felt&#xD;
"the severe afliictio'ns" of which he speaks. To such&#xD;
purpose did I strive, when the first violence of grief&#xD;
was chastened, to give such poor woi~ds of condolence&#xD;
as I could command to the stricken mother. But the&#xD;
circle was broken. The chair was vacant. The cheer-&#xD;
ful smile no longer enlivened the board; the well-&#xD;
remembered voice rang no longer at the hearth. The&#xD;
dust gathered on the favourite books. The spinning-&#xD;
&#xD;
LY WE WEISS.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
wheel was ~siIent. The necessary household duties were&#xD;
silently performed. Now and then the mother and her&#xD;
children leaned their heads mournfully together, bitt&#xD;
the tears fell in* silence, and were stealthily ~wiped&#xD;
away.&#xD;
I remained for some weeks at the cabin. Just before&#xD;
my return to the village, my father had dismissed his&#xD;
clerk, at his own request, and Charles Warren was in-&#xD;
stalled in his place. This was a most fortunate occur-&#xD;
rence, as it served to divert the widow's thoughts from&#xD;
the all-absorbing subject of her great and irr~p~rab1e&#xD;
loss. Paul was successful in his school, and the friends&#xD;
of the family found means to relieve them from all&#xD;
fears of pecuniary embarrassment. A short time after&#xD;
I returned home, the family removed to the Falls. By&#xD;
a little exertion on the ~part of his friends, the appoint-&#xD;
ment of postmaster was obtained for Charles Warren;&#xD;
and thus, for the time, all was well.&#xD;
I was, more than once, urged to reveal the partieu-&#xD;
lars of the attack upon me; but, feeling that I could&#xD;
not swear positively to the commission of the act by&#xD;
Dodge, I refused to do so. My recollection was, of&#xD;
course, imperfect ~ and, besides the want of positive&#xD;
testimony, the circumstantial evidence was by far too&#xD;
meagre to convict a man on so grave an accusation'&#xD;
Oh, how tediously that long winter wore away I I&#xD;
saw Jessie but seldom, and never alone. Dr. Dodge&#xD;
had become an inmate of the family, and 'it was cur-&#xD;
rently reported that the marriage would take place in&#xD;
May. When, at length, spring 'came, I resorted t~o ~y.&#xD;
favourite amu~ements.' Sometimes I floated ,in my&#xD;
skiff with the gentle current of' the' Bouquet. Some-&#xD;
times II sallied into the woods' with Munch and my&#xD;

however, that there was 'no zest in any of my ~leasnres.&#xD;

I had but just folded the letter, when Jerry entered&#xD;
my room. With a profound bow and a most deferen-&#xD;
tial scrape of the foot, he announced his mission. with-..&#xD;
"Mistlier Lynde, honey, yer sister Lucy'll be&#xD;
wanting ye."&#xD;
"Where is she, Jerry ?"&#xD;
"In the gairdhin jist."&#xD;
"Very well, Jerry."&#xD;
I met both my sisters near a little nursery of peach-&#xD;
trees, which had been the object of our especial care,&#xD;
and which promised to bear fruit in the course of time.&#xD;
"Why, Lynde !" exclaimed Lucy, with a very good-&#xD;
natured frown, "you're as slow us the peach~trees.&#xD;
How long is it since I sent for you ?"&#xD;
"Possibly five' minutes."&#xD;
"' Five minutes, sir? That's an age to me!' Instaiit&#xD;
obedience, if you would have my favour. Your wor-&#xD;
shipful escort, sir, is very respectfully requested as far&#xD;
as the parsonage."&#xD;
"I must decline, Lucy."&#xD;
"You must go! Get my bonnet, and Kate's, and be&#xD;
sure you ai~'e quick about it."&#xD;
"Why, Lucy !" exclaimed Kate, in a tone of~remon-&#xD;
strance.&#xD;
"Fie, Kate! lie shall go. Ii never had my way&#xD;
before in my life !"&#xD;
A merry peal of laughter from Kate denoted full&#xD;
acquiescence, and I obeyed the b~hest with what ~rac~&#xD;

and we set forth for the parsonage. We found Allan&#xD;
Grayson alone.&#xD;
"' Where. are Madam Grayson and Jessie?" asked&#xD;
Lucy.&#xD;
"In the garden, ny dear."'&#xD;
My sisters passed on1 and I was in the act of leaving&#xD;
the room when ~the clergyman called me.&#xD;
"Mr. Weiss." (He had never called me so before.),&#xD;
"&#xD;
"13e seated, if you please. I have something to say&#xD;

"I mean what I say. Do not bandy words with me.&#xD;
You are doing a great wrong."&#xD;
"How, and to whom ?"&#xD;
"You know, of course, that my friend, Doctor&#xD;

"You do not believe liim~ guilty ?"&#xD;

"Do you suspectt him ?"&#xD;
"Pardon me, Mr. Grayson. I cannot answer that&#xD;

"Well, young man, I can forgive this irreverence to&#xD;
a gray-haired pastor,. who- is, at least, entitled to&#xD;
civility."&#xD;
"M?. Grayson, I"-&#xD;
"Permit me to say to you, sir, that I have my own&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
AN AYPAIX WITH TH~ LUMDERMEN~&#xD;
MONTHS passed.~' Spring had come again. It was&#xD;
late in March. The snow was incIting rapidly, ~nd th~&#xD;
lumbermen were looking for the breaking up of the ice. -&#xD;
The timber for some fifty rafts lay upoz~ the banks ef&#xD;
the Bouquet; ~nd the jolly old raftemen rubbed their&#xD;

1han4~ in genuine glee, as they recounted their exploits&#xD;
on the rapids, and looked forward to ~another trial of&#xD;
their skill. There2 was half-a-score of young men who&#xD;
had, that winter, escaped the restraints of the school-&#xD;
room, and they were looking forward to the perilous&#xD;
descent of the rapids as the test which should give&#xD;
them character and standing among the rude but&#xD;
manly lumbermen, or overwhelm them with the dis-&#xD;
grace of failure. There was, among the lumbermen,&#xD;
an old crony of Paul Warren's, whom I had always&#xD;
liked, (none the less because Paul lo~ d him,) and who&#xD;
seemed equally attached to me. Lie was known as&#xD;
Morris Farr.. He was a tall, ungainly, ~black-looking&#xD;
personage-a jovial, hearty fellow; yet precisely the&#xD;
sort of man whom you would prefer as a friend, and not&#xD;
as an enemy. . I met Morris one day, after the ice had&#xD;
broken up, as I was hunting with Munch near the&#xD;
Lumbermen's Lodge, and he gave me his usual hearty&#xD;
greeting.&#xD;
"Hallo! Lynde, my 'boy! ' Thought I was never&#xD;
goin' to see ye no more! Why ha'n',t yot~. hen to see&#xD;
us?"&#xD;
"I hardly know, Morris.~ I"-&#xD;
"You don't know. Well, I do."&#xD;
"Hardly."&#xD;
"Then my name's not Morris Farr. Come closer,"&#xD;
added he, in a whisper, and he looked very cautiously&#xD;
around him. "You love Jessie Grayson !"&#xD;
I know~~not why, but the expression felk gratingly&#xD;
upon my ear, and I was angry with the man for his&#xD;
abrupt remark.&#xD;
"If I do," I replied, somewhat tartly, "I do not&#xD;
choose to have my private affairs meddled with by any-&#xD;
bod~%~ don't, eh ?" replied the himbe~man, a little&#xD;
nettled) as' well, he might be, by so rude an answer to a&#xD;
remark Which . h4 had made in all kindness. "Wa1,&#xD;

&#xD;
hold ye !" added he, and, as he spoke, Charks Warren&#xD;
and. Doctor Dodge approached us.&#xD;
"You Can try your hand at measuring, me, if you&#xD;
so choose," said I, angrily, not heeding the approach&#xD;
of the doctor and his companion.&#xD;
"Why, Lynde! you and Morris Farr are too good&#xD;
friends to quarrel. What are you doing, with that&#xD;
gun ?"&#xD;
"I have been hunting all day."&#xD;
"Well, come, Farr, make up. I thought Lynde&#xD;
was your best friend. Shake hands and make up."&#xD;
"I flatter myself that Morris Farr and myself are&#xD;
competent to settle our own difficulties."&#xD;
"Oh, well, if he's so touchy, let us leave him," said&#xD;
Doctor Dodge, and they walked on towards the Lodge.&#xD;
"I know that 'ere Dodge," said Norris.&#xD;
"I think it quite likely," said I abruptly, and I&#xD;
stalked away into the woods.&#xD;
An hour's walk ~nd a few shots calmed my ruffled&#xD;
temper, and I turned towards the place where I had&#xD;
met him, for the purpose of asking his pardon. As I&#xD;
did not care for further sporting, I left my gun un-&#xD;
loaded. Munch went bounding along before me-now&#xD;
following some tracl~ upon the surface of the snow-&#xD;
now gambolling about my feet~ to my no small annoy-&#xD;
ance, in a style that had more than once. welinigh sent&#xD;
me headlong. I followed the river's bank until I was&#xD;
opposite the, place where~ Farr had been chopping.&#xD;
There I found a small raft, confined to the bushes on&#xD;
the bank by a single withe. The fastening seemed in-,&#xD;
secure, and I was about to~ adjust it when I heard the&#xD;
report of a gun. I sprang hastily up the bank, think.&#xD;
ing that Chai~les Warren, or his comparison, might have&#xD;
started a deer, and made my way in the direction of&#xD;
the report. I observed that the peal of Morris parr's&#xD;
axe. had ceased, and hurried forward towards the .place&#xD;
where I had left him. A sad sight aWaited me. . At&#xD;
the foQt of a huge. pine,,, which 'he had nearly cut&#xD;
through, lay the stalwaii~ lumberman, and from a small,~'&#xD;

LYNDB WflIS$.&#xD;
but unsightly wound in his' temple, the blood wa~&#xD;
trickling down upon the snow. 2Re was stiR' warm,&#xD;
and, laying i~y hand upon his breast, I thought I could&#xD;
detect a feeble pulsation. Laying down my gun, I&#xD;
tried to staunch the wound, although, from itS position&#xD;
I thought it scarcely p~ssiblo to save him. lli~ dinner-&#xD;
basket was near him, and along with it a pitcher, such&#xD;
as the lumbermen were accustomed to use for bringing&#xD;
water from the river. Seizing this, I ran to the bank,&#xD;
and leaped upon the raft to fill the pitcher. My mo-&#xD;
mentum, it seenis, loosened the already frail fastening,&#xD;
for when I turned to 'juuip ashore, the furious current&#xD;
had swept the raft at least ten feet from the bank into&#xD;
the boiling current. Throwing the pitcher into the&#xD;
water, I grasped, instinctively, a setting-pole, which,&#xD;
fortunately for me, lay upon the raft, and, for a few&#xD;
minutes, every thought was absorbed by my perilous&#xD;
situation. For a considerable distance there were no&#xD;
very abrupt turns in the river's channel, and there was&#xD;
little dt~nger, provided I could regain the shore before&#xD;
the raft should reach the rapids. I strained every&#xD;
nerve to guide it to the nearest point; 'but the river&#xD;
was swollen to a great height-the setting-pole was un-&#xD;
~wieldy-~---the current was very strong-and, in utter&#xD;
despair, I passed the point. There was yet another&#xD;
chanc~ for me. A little below the point was an eddy,&#xD;
into which there wa~ a possibility that I might guide&#xD;
the raft. If I failed, there wals 'but the perilous alter~&#xD;
native of leaping into the boiling, current and attempt-&#xD;
'ing to swim to the shore. Exerting all my strength, I&#xD;
succeeded in gaining the eddy. A loud shout greeted&#xD;
x~iy ear as I approached the shore.&#xD;
"Hallo! Lynde, is that~ you ?"~ exclaimed Barney&#xD;
Fogg as I. leaped ashore. Beside him stood Frank&#xD;
Gibson.&#xD;
"W~ thought it ~was all day with you, Lyn&amp;amp;," said&#xD;
the latter. "You have had a narrow escape. Why,&#xD;
you've hurt yo~.irself. Where does' this hlood come&#xD;
&#xD;
from? Your hands are both bloody !-and this sleeve,&#xD;
and your vest I"&#xD;
I shuddered as I thought of m~' gun, left by the&#xD;
body, and of the, Possibility that my bloody appearance,&#xD;
together with, the fact of its being. found there, might&#xD;
direct suspicion to me. Confused for the moment, I&#xD;
replied-.&#xD;
"I-i--Morris Farr is killed 1"&#xD;
"Morris Farr!. Killed ?"&#xD;
"Yes-that is, I believe he is not quite dead."&#xD;
"Blow did it happen ?"&#xD;
"211 cannot tell. Will one of you go for Dr. Blair,&#xD;
while I return to the shanties ?"&#xD;
"I'll go," replied Frank Gibson,. hastily; "and&#xD;
maybe the constable wouldn't be amiss. Eh, Lynde?&#xD;
You are looking pale to-day."&#xD;
And he bounded away towards the Falls. Leaving&#xD;
the bank of the river, I led the way for my companion&#xD;
to a narrow lumber-road, along which we urged our&#xD;
way at a rapid pace towards the Lodge. As we ap~&#xD;
preached the body, we heard the sound of voices, and I&#xD;
shuddered as I heard Charles Warren say-&#xD;
"Oh, I am certain of it. I know his gun as well as 211&#xD;
do my own."&#xD;
" Had a bit of a quarrel, you say ?"&#xD;
"Both were in evident ill-temper," replied DoctQr&#xD;
Dodge. "Ah! here he is, boys!" he added, as '1i~ saw&#xD;
me approaching. "The blood isn't dry on him."&#xD;
"Is he alive ?" I asked, almost breathless with my&#xD;
walk.&#xD;
"As dead as his axe !" answered one of the blmber0&#xD;
men, with a scowl. "Better for you, I'm thinking , ef he&#xD;
W~8 alive. Killed the best feller in the settlement,&#xD;
since Paul Warren died. Shouldn't wonder ef you hed&#xD;
a hand in that."&#xD;
"Liar !" I retorted, and* I levelled &amp;amp; blow at him&#xD;
which would have felled him to the ground had not&#xD;
some one caught my arm*.&#xD;
"So! ~o-o-Q !" hissed the fellow through hi~ teeth,&#xD;

I again appealed to the infuriated men, but was at&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
A WEEK IN~ JAIL.-THE TRIAL.&#xD;
OH that week in prison! I would not pass another&#xD;
such for years of life. True, I was allowed the use of&#xD;
books and paper. My father, my uncle Hugh, and my&#xD;
aunt Caroline, Grifliths, and my sisters visited me-as&#xD;
did many others. I was supplied with every imaginable&#xD;
comfort, and was partially reconciled to my confinement&#xD;
by the assurance that few, if any, thought me capable&#xD;
of the commission of such a deed as was laid to my&#xD;
charge.~ Counsellor S-.~--, whom my father had em-&#xD;
ployed as leading counsel, visited me, and heard my&#xD;
detailed statement of facts. Kate whispered in my ear&#xD;
a kind message from the parsonage. Yet, notwith-&#xD;
standing all this, I passed the week in agony. I could&#xD;
not read, or write, or think. I could not rest. I have&#xD;
no words-nay, there are no words-that can ade-&#xD;
quately express my wretchedness. Not merely that I&#xD;
was charged with the comi4~ion of a foul crime; not&#xD;
that my defence seemed almost hopeless; not that I&#xD;
was, in all' probability, to die a dog's death by the hang-&#xD;
man; but that I was fettered. Against the probable&#xD;
result of the trial I could nerve myself; but the being&#xD;
chained, like a sheep-slaying cur-oh, that was what&#xD;
goaded me to madness. The snow melted from the&#xD;
earth. The mild air of spring came in nt my grated&#xD;
window. I could hear the robin's song at daybreak, and&#xD;
I strode angrily, in my clanking fetters, to and' fro in&#xD;
my cell,-4' have lain for weeks upon the couch of sick-&#xD;
ness. I have been confined for weary' days and nights&#xD;
to a narrow berth in a ship's forecastle; but, in all my&#xD;
life, I remember nothing that so ~gnawed at my very&#xD;
life-strings as that week's confinement in jail.&#xD;
&#xD;
LY2~DE WEIS0.              157&#xD;
It wore away, and at length came the' day appointed&#xD;
for the trial. It was about nine o'clock that I was con~&#xD;
ducted by the sheriff to the court-house. There was an&#xD;
immense concourse of people around the jail. They'&#xD;
were gathered in knots and engaged in eager conversa-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"Here he comes !'~' said somebody, as. I left the yard&#xD;
of the jail; and, instantly, all eyes were turned upon&#xD;
me. The crowd approached as near to me as the guard&#xD;
would permit, and I heard not a. few declaring their&#xD;
belief in my innocence.&#xD;
"Keep up good heart, Lynde !" said Paul Warren,&#xD;
who, it seemed, had come home to attend the trial; and&#xD;
the words provoked a murmur of approbation in the&#xD;
crowd,&#xD;
"Chip o' the old block !" said one.&#xD;
"Ay, that he is. What 'd old. Paul a' said to the&#xD;
like o' this ?" said another.&#xD;
As I entered the' court-house~ I turned to .catch the&#xD;
eye of the young student; when, directly ~ehind him,.&#xD;
I met the glance ~of Dr. Dodge bent upon me, wiA~h a&#xD;
smile of malignant satisfaction., lit was but for an in.&#xD;
stant. We passed on, and I was placed in. the dock. I&#xD;
looked around me; and as I found every eye bent upon&#xD;
me, a sense of my own innocence and of the wrong&#xD;
abQut to be done me~ gave me the ~air of proud defiance&#xD;
as I looked arou~ui me. The tedious empanneling of&#xD;
the jury was at last got through with, and the indict~&#xD;
went read,&#xD;
"What say you, Lynde Weiss ?" asked the clerk,&#xD;
"are you guilty, or not guilty ?"&#xD;
"Not guilty !" I answered.&#xD;
"Are you ready, gentlemen?" asked~ the district &amp;amp;t~'&#xD;
torney.&#xD;
"We are, sir," replied Counsellor $-.; and the&#xD;
former addressed the jury.&#xD;
He began with some general remarks about their re~&#xD;
sponsibility, 'in the trial of an offence involving the&#xD;
reputation and liberty-perhaps the life-of the pri-&#xD;

sorter. He reminded them that the court would in-&#xD;
struct them to givo the ac~ised the benefit of any&#xD;
rational doubt of his guilt. "But, gentlemen," he s~id&#xD;
in conclusion, "while you must not suffer yourselves to&#xD;
be prejudiced against the prisoner, it is my duty to&#xD;
caution you not to suffer your previous acquaintan~o&#xD;
with him, or your previous regard for him, to interfere&#xD;
with your solemn duty. We will now proceed with the&#xD;
evidence.. Samuel Saxton !"&#xD;
"Samuel Saxton I" repeated the sheriff.&#xD;

"Takethe stand."&#xD;
"Now, Mr. Sexton," said Mr. Harper, the common-&#xD;
wealth's attorney, when the witness had been sworn,&#xD;
"tell the jury what you know of this affair."&#xD;
The witness stated, in a surly, dogged tone, that, on&#xD;
the day of the murder, Morris Parr had been ordered&#xD;
to fell a large pine; that he went directly to the place&#xD;
and began the task; that about two o'clock, he heard&#xD;
several sh~s, and the barking of a dog; tha~t he paid&#xD;
no attention to it; that a few minutes after this, Charles&#xD;
Warren and Dr. Dodge came to the Lodge, with their&#xD;
dogs and guns, and that he invited them in to drink with&#xD;
him; that they Aid so; that immediately afterward, on&#xD;
leaving the Lodge, the dogs struck each a different trail,&#xD;
and that Charles Warren said to the doctor, "Dodge,&#xD;
you follow that trail, and I'll follow thi8 ~ that they both&#xD;
disappeared in ~the woods; that, some twenty minutes&#xD;
later, he heard a single shot; immediately after which&#xD;
they returned, beth' at the same time, in the same direc-&#xD;
tions in which they left him; that', he heard Doctor L~odge&#xD;
say, "Come, Warren, this is dull sport; let us go home ;"&#xD;

homeward, to see how Parr was getting along; that&#xD;
th~yifound him . lying at the foot of' the pine, dead;&#xD;
that the prisoner's gun lay beside him in the:snow, and&#xD;
that there were fresh tracks both towards and from the&#xD;
river.; that they followed the tracks to the bank, where&#xD;
&#xD;
they could be traced no farther; ~but- saw no one, and&#xD;
therefore returned to the.b~dy.&#xD;
"Are you aware of' ahy ill-feeling between the de-&#xD;
ceased and the prisoner ?"&#xD;
"Why, I've hearn tell"-.&#xD;
"Never mind what you have heard. Do you know&#xD;
of any."&#xD;
"No, sir; t~iey was always uncommon good friends,&#xD;
fur as I knowed any thin' 'bout it."&#xD;
"That will do. Mr. 8-, have you any questions&#xD;
to ask the witness ?"&#xD;
* "One or two, Mr. Harper. What were you doing&#xD;
when Warren and Dodge found you at the Lodge ?"&#xD;
"Mending a sled, sir ?"&#xD;
"They went in different directions, you say ?"&#xD;
"Yes;"&#xD;
"And returned at the same time ?"&#xD;
" es."&#xD;
"Would the course taken by either of them- lead you&#xD;
near the place where-Parr was chopping ?"&#xD;
"It would. Doctor Dodge must have gone mighty&#xD;
nigh in sight o' the spot."&#xD;
Here there was a general turning of heads; but Doc-&#xD;
tor Dodge 'was not in the court-room. -&#xD;
"They returned, you say, in the same directions in&#xD;
which they started ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Did you see any thing peculiar in the manner of'&#xD;
either' of those gentlemen ?" - -&#xD;
"No, sir, I can't sa~ as I did; though I thought Doc-&#xD;
tor Dodge seemed to be in consid'ble of a hurry to start -&#xD;

"Very well; you may go down." -&#xD;
Charles Warren was then called. lie stated that, on&#xD;
the day set forth in~ the indictment, he went to the&#xD;
lumber settlement with Doctor. Dodge, with two dogs and&#xD;
guns, for a few hours' sport; that they found Farr and&#xD;
the prisoner in an altercation. . - -&#xD;

"Not' very. ]?arr said, 'Don't get into a luncheon,&#xD;

"You left them, then ~"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Heard no more hard words ?"&#xD;
"No,. sir."&#xD;
* "Did you hear any threats Y" asked Mr. S.&#xD;
"I did not. The prisoner said they could settle their&#xD;
own difficulties."&#xD;
"That will do."&#xD;
"Doctor William Dodge !" called Mr. Harper.&#xD;
"William Dodge !" echoed the sheriff.&#xD;
"Here I" replied the witness; and he made his way&#xD;
to the stand.&#xD;
His testimony, as elicited by the prosecuting attorney,&#xD;
was of the same tenor -as that of Warren, and he was&#xD;
handed over to my' counsel.&#xD;
"How long were you gone on the trail which you&#xD;
followed 'from the Lodge?" asked Mr. S&#xD;
"Possibly twenty minutes."&#xD;
"Did you see Farr?"&#xD;
"I did not."&#xD;
The witness smiled, as' if ridiculing' the idea of his&#xD;
beiPg suspected.&#xD;
IL turned to the court.&#xD;
"May I ask the witness a question, your honour ?"&#xD;
"Certainly."&#xD;
"Doctor Dodge, did you ever know Morris Farr, be-&#xD;
fore you came to Boylston ?"&#xD;
He turned pale for an instant, but answered firmly,&#xD;
"Never."&#xD;
Young Gibson and Barney Fogg were then called in&#xD;
succession., and testified to the 'facts already known to&#xD;
the reader. There was a murmur of satisfaction as they&#xD;
stated IL had requested them to go for the doctor; bat;&#xD;
this gave place to gloom and doubt when it was further&#xD;
elicited that my manner was confused, and That my&#xD;
hands, sleeves, and vest were bloody. The coat, vest,&#xD;
&#xD;
~*nd gun were then produced and identified. The boots&#xD;
that IL wore were produced, and several witnesses swore&#xD;
to the exact correspondence of size with the tracks near&#xD;
the body, and those going to and from the river. It&#xD;
was further proved t~jat the pitcher belonging ti~ Furr&#xD;
bad been found in the channel of the river, a short dis-&#xD;
tance below the Lodge, but a day or~ two previous to&#xD;
the trial.&#xD;
Having got through with. the witnesses, the district&#xD;
attorney arose and addressed the jury.~ 'He had under-&#xD;
taken, he said, the discharge of an unpleasant duty, at&#xD;
the opening of the case, with the hope-almost with the&#xD;
belief, that the prisoner was innocent. Yet. so full, so&#xD;
unbroken ~was the chain of testimony, that (however&#xD;
painful it might be to him, as an old friend of the&#xD;
prisoner's father,) he must say that there was no doubt&#xD;
of his guilt. lit was proved that there were hard&#xD;
words-that the parties 'were left together-that the&#xD;
gun, the tracks, and the spots of blood had\ been sworn&#xD;
to by unimpeachable witnesses. "I will not now say&#xD;
more," added he; "we will see what the prisoners&#xD;
counsel has to urge in his defence."&#xD;
Counsellor S---... rose slowly, as if overwhelmed by&#xD;
the weight of adverse testimony.&#xD;
"May it please your honour and. the gentlemen of&#xD;
the jury," he began, "I frankly confess to you that the&#xD;
testimony against the prisoner at the bar is very&#xD;
strong. Yet I say t~ you, in all sincerity, that I be-&#xD;
heve him to be as guiltless of the murder of Morris&#xD;
Parr as I cam. Let me beg you to bear in. mind that,&#xD;

occurred during the last few months, and which, you&#xD;
will pardon. me for saying, have had somewhat to do&#xD;
with the prisoner's manifest depression of spirits, are&#xD;

love-separated from her by some untoward occur-&#xD;

from the quiet of .his boyhood's home, and, in an hour&#xD;
of want, 'signs a ship's articles. for a voyage to the&#xD;
Pacific. Well, gentlemen, it is further in evidence&#xD;
here, that, at Albany, he became acquainted with&#xD;
Doctor William Dodge. He accompanied him to New&#xD;
Bedford, became attached to him, and gave him ~his&#xD;
full confidence. Abusing that confidence octor&#xD;
Dodge endeavours to supplant him. Y u have the de-&#xD;
positions of the landlord and cI at Dodge was at&#xD;

leave Mr. Grmy~on's apa tment immediately af~er the&#xD;
prisoner left the office. The door of the apartment&#xD;
was open, and Miss Grayson testifies that~ she recog-&#xD;
nised the prisoner, as Doctor Dodge attempted to take&#xD;
her hand, in declaring that he loved her. The prisoner&#xD;
goes to sea in despair-is gone some months-and,&#xD;
after a~ variety of hardships, he comes home penniless,&#xD;
on foot, travel-worn, heart-broken, to see his ~aged&#xD;
father, who was then confined to his sick-chambe~. He&#xD;
meets Miss Grayson on the 'Ledge, in sight of her&#xD;
father's house. He zsees some one leaving her as he&#xD;
approaches. It was Doctor Dodge. He is somewhat&#xD;
rudely separated from her by her father, and is found&#xD;
late at night by his faithful servant, wounded and&#xD;
senseless. Gentlemen !" exclaimed Mr~ S.-, raising&#xD;
his voice till the court-room rang with it, "who struck&#xD;
that cowardly blow?"&#xD;
"No one knows," said the district attorney.&#xD;
"" True, gentlemen, no one knows, and why? The&#xD;
prisoner lingered for weeks. in delirii~m and fever, and&#xD;

since he has recovered,' he resolutely refuses to say&#xD;
whose hand dealt the blow."&#xD;
"Does he know ?" asked the court.&#xD;
9 He says he will not swear to it, your honour, and&#xD;
therefore I will not dwell on this. I will only say,&#xD;
who else but Dodge could have struck the blow? He&#xD;
never had an enemy at ]3oylston, and iDr. Blair~ells&#xD;
us that the blow could not possibly have been struck&#xD;
by himself."&#xD;
"May it please your honour," interrupted the prose-&#xD;
cuting attorney, "all this"-&#xD;
"Is relevant to the issue, sir," resumed Mr~ 5-.&#xD;
"I have but little more to say. The prisoner recovers.&#xD;
The former familiar 'intercourse is broken oil' between&#xD;
him and Miss Grayson, while Dodge manages to ingra-&#xD;
tiate himself with the unsuspecting father and mother.&#xD;
The prisoner resorts to his favourite amusements-,-.&#xD;
hunting, fishing, and the like-and is proved to have&#xD;
,been in the habit of meeting Farr, with whom he was&#xD;
always on tke best of terms. On the day of the mur-&#xD;
der, it is proved that his tracks led away from the&#xD;
body towards the river, but they were also found ~eav-&#xD;
ing the well-beaten lumber-road, which~ . led directly&#xD;
from the body. ' This was not two yards from the road&#xD;

by their evident suspicion, and knowing how much ap-&#xD;

"No! Bless you! bless you, Mr. 5-! lIe is&#xD;

clasped the hand of the speaker.&#xD;
"Order! Silence !" said the sheriff, mildly, but his&#xD;
eyes, and hundreds more, were wet with tears.&#xD;
"I believe she is right, gentlemen," resumed Mr.&#xD;
S.-.--., when he had gently reseated' my sister. "But&#xD;
there is one other point to which I beg you to give&#xD;
heed, and which will show the court and my learned&#xD;
friend over the way, that m~ remarks have not been so&#xD;
irrelevaiit as they may have seemed. It is in evidence&#xD;
that Dodge left Saxton, and went into the woods in a&#xD;
direction which must have carried him nearly, if not&#xD;
fully, in. sight of Parr. Now, I am not permitted to&#xD;
show you that Parr had, a few moments before, de-&#xD;
clared that he knew Dodge."&#xD;
"Really, your honour," interposed the prosecuting&#xD;

"Well, let that 'passb But I may show, and I have&#xD;
shown, that Dodge. was in' a very remarkable hurry to&#xD;
get home. Who is this Dodge? 'Does anybody know?&#xD;
Gentlemen, I must close. I confess that I cannot give&#xD;
you positive proof of the prisoner's innocence, but can&#xD;
you doubt it? I think not. There is no positive evi-&#xD;
dence Qf guilt-no pretence of previous malice-no&#xD;
proof whatever of any adequate cause for' the murder.&#xD;
If you have any doi~bts of his guilt, gentlemen, bear it&#xD;
well in mind that you cannot bring him in guilty. The&#xD;
attorney, for the commonwealth has~reminded you of&#xD;
your duty in bringing in a verdict according to the&#xD;
'evidence. And what is the evidence? Wo34d any one&#xD;

gentlemen! You are too intelligent, too manly, too&#xD;
christianized, to do so merciless an act of injustice.&#xD;
Admit for a moment that, in a paroxysm of passion,&#xD;
the, prisoner had committed the crime. It were. then&#xD;
but homicide, and his life, at least, were safe. 'But&#xD;
will' you even deprive him of liberty on so frail a tissue&#xD;
of evidence? I cannot believe it. No, gentlemen,&#xD;
even where there is "positive proof of' guilt, justice is&#xD;
not a soulless stock-a mere Juggernaut, underneath&#xD;
whose ruthless wheels whosoever falls must be inevita-&#xD;
bly crushed. You may admire the artist's conceit in&#xD;
painting her blind; but she need not, therefore, be&#xD;
deaf. If justice and punishment be synonymous, why,&#xD;
then, be the reeking axe, and not the scales, her em-&#xD;
blem. Let the lowly, self~righteous Pharisee, the~&#xD;
ceremony-begotten, form-nurtured saints, whose 'fine&#xD;
linen' ~is their 'righteousness,' say what they will.&#xD;
Humanity and religion' say that the deed alone shall&#xD;
not constitute the crime. T-he scales were, else, as well&#xD;
the ghastly gibbet, stationary, senseless, merciless; as&#xD;
nell' the guillotine, that never moves but at the behest&#xD;
of death. Justice! She weeps' scalding tears over the&#xD;
deeds done in her name. Why, gentlemen, Mercy held&#xD;
her arm when-if the popular orthodoxy he~ true-she&#xD;
would have sent earth's quivering millions to a hope-&#xD;
less eternity of agony. Mercy is the right even of&#xD;
the guilty; how much mere his right whose guilt you&#xD;

He took his seat, and the district attorney rose in&#xD;
reply. He began by saying that he must acknowledge&#xD;
that his friend 5- 'had never more eloquently ad~&#xD;
dressed a jury in behalf of a prisoner. How good a&#xD;
compliment he had paid the jury, on the present occa~&#xD;
sion, by appealing to their feelings, instead of their&#xD;
judgments, he left for themselves to decide. Were his&#xD;
own feelings to bring in the verdict, the prisoner should&#xD;
go free, for it was no case of hardened crime. But he&#xD;
and they were there t? uphold the law-to discharge&#xD;
duties upon oath-to give in a verdict according to the&#xD;
evidence, and not in accordance with their feelings.&#xD;
He then reviewed the testimony, and sat down.&#xD;
The judge charged the jury to the effect that if they&#xD;
had any reasonable doubt--and this he took care to&#xD;
define very carefully-they were to 'give the prisoner&#xD;
the benefit0 of it; and with some feeling remarks on the&#xD;
solemn responsibility under which they rested, he closed&#xD;
'his remarks.&#xD;
Oh, what terrible moments were those which suc-&#xD;
ceeded! The jury retired, andl was remanded to my&#xD;
cell. All access was denied to.~ me, and I paced the&#xD;
stony floor in utter despair. To increase the gloom, of&#xD;
my cell, a 'fierce storm came on, accompanied by the&#xD;
first thunder that I had heard since the coming of&#xD;
spring. The lightning hashed, sending its fierce glare&#xD;
into my narrow iron.barred window, almost blinding&#xD;
me with light, and then leaving me in rayless darkness.&#xD;
It was welluigh day ere I slept.&#xD;
At the opening of the court I was again ushered to&#xD;
the dock. Some preliminary business was 'attended to,&#xD;
and the clerk then said to the jury-&#xD;
"Gentlemen of the jury, are you agreed ?"&#xD;
"We are," replied the foreman.&#xD;
"What do you say? Is the prisoner at the bar&#xD;
guilty, or not guilty ?""&#xD;
I remember hearing a loud shriek, and then a feel-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing of dizziness came over me, as I heard th~ an-&#xD;
nouncement. It could have been~ but momentary, for I&#xD;
heard the sheriff exclaiming-.&#xD;
"Silence in court !" in a* loud and authoritative&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
"Silence !" thundered he again, and the tumult was&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
~&#xD;
FoR a few days there. was a great deal of talk about&#xD;
the trial. It was urged by some that Dodge should&#xD;
be arrested and tried, while, others asked, "' To what&#xD;
purpose ?" What new fact could be elicited? True,&#xD;
it was proved that I was innocent; but where was there&#xD;
any thing better than circumstantial evidence against&#xD;
Dodge? The excitement wore away gradually, and, as&#xD;
is usual in such cases, many took sides with the doctor&#xD;
as an injured man-the more readily, since Allan&#xD;
Grayson and his wife remained his staunch friends. He&#xD;
was still an inmate of the parsonage, and it became a&#xD;
settled understanding that ~his marriage with Jessie&#xD;
Grayson would positively take 'place 'ere the moon&#xD;
waned. So reliably, did this rumour come to me, that&#xD;
I, at length, gave it credence, thinking that, with Jes-'&#xD;
sie, pity had given place to a warmer feeling. Accord-&#xD;
ingly I did~ not visit the parsonage. I resumed my&#xD;
sports in the woods, and upon the river I refitted my&#xD;
sloop. Paul Warren' remained a few days at home to&#xD;
recruit his health, and we were ever together. In this&#xD;
way it happened that I was scarcely ever at home.&#xD;
~one of the family molested me, and .~ felt grateful for&#xD;
their forbearance-the more so, as it seemed the tacit&#xD;
reward for my abandoning a recent intention to go to&#xD;
sea. I became a constant visitor at my foster-mother's,&#xD;
and the former coolness wore away. There' was appa-&#xD;
rently 'but ~one of the family who had i~ot, to some ex-&#xD;
tent, recovered from the shock of the father's death-&#xD;
and that' was Judith. I observed that she' became a&#xD;
constant visitor at~ the parsonage, and that my sisters&#xD;
scarcely ever went there; while both they and Griffiths,&#xD;
&#xD;
LYND~ WEISS.               169&#xD;
my father and my uncle Hugh, especially the latter,&#xD;
became, every day, more attached to the widow .and~&#xD;
her excellent family. I saDw,' too, with the keenest&#xD;
pleasure, that Grifliths Was becoming ~very attentive to&#xD;
Mary Warren, while Charleis Warren, to whom my&#xD;
father was gradually resigning the entire management&#xD;
of hi~ large and prosperous business,, was more than&#xD;
suspected of making advances to my sister Lucy~ In~&#xD;
this manner three weeks passed away. It was near&#xD;
the last of April, and but a single week remained he~&#xD;
fore the ~expected' wedding.~ I ~had persuaded' Paul to&#xD;
remain at home until that time,' on the condition that'&#xD;
half of our time should be devoted to study. ~One&#xD;
evening-it was Thur~day, I remember---we were pass-&#xD;
ing the inn, when a traveller rode leisurely 'to the door&#xD;
on horseback. It so happened t1iat~: neither mine host&#xD;
nor the ostler~ was at hand to receive him. 'He dis-&#xD;

"You Jack Collins!' Jack Collins, .1 say!" shouted&#xD;

Dodge, and invited ihine host to take wine with us for&#xD;
the purpose of. obtaining all possible information.&#xD;
"If it's a fair question," said tholatter, whose ~curi-&#xD;

you inquire so particularly about Doctor Dodge~ Old&#xD;
acquaintance, eh ?"&#xD;
"Yes. Butyon seem to. know less about him than&#xD;
Ido."&#xD;
"Bless your heart, stranger, we don't know any&#xD;
thing about him. He came here a little .more'n a year&#xD;
ago, and stuck up his shingle as a doctor. He hadn't&#xD;
done much in that line; but he lives well, and has&#xD;
plenty ~ money.~~&#xD;
"That he has, I'll be bound."&#xD;
"How he gets it, no one knows."&#xD;
"I think I can tell you."&#xD;
"Well, how?"&#xD;
"He is a professed gambler."&#xD;
"You don'1 say so."&#xD;
"Fact. But, I say, does he mix in society here?"&#xD;
"Bless you, yes. Great ladies'.~man, though I won-&#xD;
der that ladies will associate with a man who won't tell&#xD;
who he is, where he comes from, nor nothing' else. He's&#xD;
going to marry Parson Grayson's daughter. Why,&#xD;
what's the matter, Lynde ?"&#xD;
"Oh, nothing."&#xD;
"Why, .whai~ made you start so&#xD;
"Nothing-a momentary pain in my side.&#xD;
"Miarried, do you say ~" exclaimed the stranger,&#xD;
while he fixed his keen glance upon me.&#xD;
"Are , he has a wife already, and two children."&#xD;

"As sure as I 'am that I si~ here. I live in the towu&#xD;

We did so. For a moment all was still, but,. a&#xD;

raised.&#xD;

"Yes, if you'll include the Warrens~ in the invita-&#xD;

"And why not invite the Graysons ?" asked Kate.&#xD;
"To be sure," added Lucy; "and we must include&#xD;
that hateful Doctor Dodg~ or Jessie won't be per-&#xD;

"Then we will not invite any of them," said my&#xD;
father, gravely, and the matter Was dropped by gene-&#xD;

The sun had not long been above the Green Moun-&#xD;

me.&#xD;
"You've been a sailor, it seems," he said, as the lest&#xD;
sheet was belayed.&#xD;
Yes."&#xD;
"At sea?"&#xD;
"Yes; but I owe all my sailor-craft to Captain Gay-&#xD;
ger. 'The Empress' and' I are old cronies~"&#xD;
"So it seem8. By the way, have you seen Doctor&#xD;
Dodge this morning ?"&#xD;
"No."&#xD;
"You say he's about to be married 7"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"That must be prevented."&#xD;
"Can it be?"&#xD;
"Yes, and I'm the. man to do it."&#xD;
"You are confident?"&#xD;
"My life on't."&#xD;
I then explained our plan to him.&#xD;
"Capital!" he exclaimed. "By the way, will you&#xD;
make any stat at theisland 7"&#xD;
"Two hours, possibly."&#xD;
"Very well. We~ll have a walk, eli? I've a story&#xD;
to tell you~"&#xD;
"I am at your service, sir," I replied, and we went&#xD;
aft.&#xD;
The wind hauled a 'little to -the westward and by&#xD;
ten o'clockk we 'were at our destination. 'Wp ran into a&#xD;
little bay, which was so effectually sheltered by a pro-&#xD;
jecting~ point, th~t we laid "The Empress?' alongside&#xD;
the rooks, (far there was' no 'Wharf,) so~ near~. that, we&#xD;
easily threw a plank ashore, and lauded without diffi-&#xD;

been on the island before, we left the vessel for a walk.&#xD;

Ito separate the stranger from the rest, andwe crossed&#xD;
the ridge and descended to the opposite shore.&#xD;
QN~w for tho story," said 1, as 'we seated 'ourselves&#xD;
on the trunk of a fallen pine.&#xD;
I' You shall have it in few words. But, first of all,&#xD;
my name is James Van Oman. I live in Frankf~rt,&#xD;
-Maine. About four years ago, as near as I can re-&#xD;
member-yes, it was four years. ago, in March-I was&#xD;
standing on the wharf at Frankfort, (it had but, one&#xD;
then,) chatting with two or three of my neighbQurs.&#xD;
"'Blowin' great guns,' says one.&#xD;
"'The river-craft can't show a rag, said another.&#xD;
"'I'll make you a bi~t on't, gentlemen,' says - I,&#xD;
Cap'n Harlow is due today, and if he's inside of&#xD;
Owl's Head, he'll come up the river in spite o' any&#xD;
wind that ever blew in Penohscot Bay." ~&#xD;
"' I'd like to see him try,' said s&amp;amp;tne one.&#xD;
"'Well, there's a chance for ye, neighbour,' says I,&#xD;
' for if that a'n't the Jane A. Jersey comm' round the&#xD;
p'int, 131 buy me a pair o' glasses~.'&#xD;
"I was right. There was the Jane;.'under~ roofed&#xD;
foretopsail and courses, beating' 'up on the flood tide,&#xD;
and~ the water . foamin' and splashing' ;over her bows' lii&#xD;
* great style. Well, in a few niitAites she was m6ored&#xD;
'longside the wharf. Cap'n had a passenger, and who&#xD;
d'ye think it was? Why, this 'ere same Dodge. lie&#xD;
took lod~in's at the tavern. No one could ever flnd&#xD;
out- who he was. 11'e~ got acquainted, though, and as&#xD;
he~ was well-dressed, and paid for every thing regu-&#xD;
lady, he was., well received. Well, by-and-by, he f4ls&#xD;
in' love with~ one of the ~~rettiest girls in Frankfort~&#xD;
The old folks inade~ a great to-do about it, but it wa'n't&#xD;
no use. She was bent on havin' him, and so she did.&#xD;
Well, he -conducted himself very well, and matters went&#xD;
on quietly. There was. one thing, though, that he was&#xD;
in the babit~of doin', thaV didn't suit neither the old&#xD;
folks .~ ~ior' his~ :wife. Before his marriage, h~ used to&#xD;
~jo away' from Frankfort, and -be gone a~veral days.&#xD;
&#xD;
Jfhere, nobody kiew. - After: he* got married It w~s -&#xD;
the same thing.' Well, hequarre~lled with the Qid folks,&#xD;
and they determined to watch him. They hired a man~&#xD;
to follow him-and where do you think he went? Why&#xD;
to a den of gamblers in floston, where he seemed t~ 'be&#xD;
hand and glove with the whole set. lie was either&#xD;
mighty lucky, or else he played foul, for he won lots o'&#xD;
money. Things went on~ worse an' worse, until, at&#xD;
last, they had a grand blow-up, and Doctor Dodge, ~s&#xD;
he calls himself, come up mission . He was OWin' me&#xD;
the ni~ little Sum o' seventy dollars, and I've come to&#xD;
get it."&#xD;
"Of course you have the proofs of.these. f~cts?"&#xD;
"Nevei, fear, sir. I've something' better 'n proofs.&#xD;
When I come to Boylaton, I thoughtt I would let the&#xD;
feller go on his own way, provided he'd pay rue, for I&#xD;
felt s'ure he'd git hung in the end. BI~t I won't see&#xD;
another woman deceived by him. You urust know that&#xD;
nigh a year arter he run away, a schooner from&#xD;
Charleston, down in South Carolina, comes to Frank-&#xD;
fort. The skipper inquires 'bout this 'ere Dodge, and&#xD;
what do you thinks he turns out to be? -Why, the&#xD;
same feller that committed the big forgery to Gh~rles.&#xD;
ton, a few years ago; and here,"' added Van Oman,&#xD;
"is 'the do~kyment what'll bring Doctor D~d~e .to h~s&#xD;

with logs and drift-wood. 'Before noon~ the bri4ge,~wa~&#xD;
swept away, and the only remaining mean~ of ~cr~ing&#xD;
the river was a narrow and somewhat frail foot-bridge,&#xD;
which had been built for the convenience of) ~he *ork.&#xD;
men at the forge, and which was but a few yar~s above&#xD;
the dam. It. was huil-t somewhat in the ~mai~ner of ~a&#xD;
suspension-bridge, being supported, by iron z'ods~ and it&#xD;
was sufficiently strong for any ordinary'. purpose.. hi-&#xD;
deed, it was thought to be amply strong to si~ppprt the&#xD;

"The Washington Inn" had provided most bountifully&#xD;
for his~'guests, and what with the earlier potations of&#xD;
the day, it was no great marvel that they grew noisy&#xD;
and somewhat troublesome. The dinner, however,&#xD;
passed without any serious disturbance. The politics&#xD;
of 'the' day then engrossed the attention of the village&#xD;
politicians, who disconrsed learnedly to the lumbermen&#xD;
of State-rights and the tariff, democracy and federal-&#xD;
ism-mtrch, it must be confessed, to their mystification.&#xD;
As the afternoon wore away, the potations of the&#xD;
throng'grew deeper and more frequent. Loud words&#xD;
were now heard, and feeling 'confident that the usual&#xD;
quantity of fighting was about to commence, by way of&#xD;
vent 'to 'the ' excit~ixient of the occasion, I turned to&#xD;
Paul and asked him' to accompany~me home.&#xD;
' "Sha'~n~t we stay, Lynde, and see the opening of the&#xD;
bear-garden ?" he said, laughing.&#xD;
No7 go home with me."&#xD;
"Well, y-ou'll.drink a glass of wine-with me&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
We stepped. to the barand were lifting our glasses,&#xD;
when' Paul was 'very rudely interrupted by some one at&#xD;
his elbow.&#xD;
'"What d~ you. mean, sir ?" asked Doctor Dodge,&#xD;
(for it was he.) "You knocked my tumbler out of my&#xD;
hahdV'&#xD;
"It was entirely accidental. 'Pardon me.&#xD;
"Accidental, you say. Perhaps 50."&#xD;
".Youcan take it as you please."~&#xD;
"Then take 'that !" exclaimed he, and, quick as&#xD;
lightning,"'he dealt ~Paul a blow that made him reel&#xD;
against me. '.' My' arm was caught as I attempted to&#xD;
punish the miscreant.&#xD;
"Stop a ~inute, LyLide !" exclaimed Sam Saxton,&#xD;
the lumberman. "I've a small account ~to settle with&#xD;
this gentleman," and be laid 'his iron grasp upon his&#xD;
victim's throat.&#xD;
'"Ibid on, Sam ! ~Don't choke him! 1"ve a settle-&#xD;

8ent~y~O make&#xD;
men         with that feller," said' another, and pre~&#xD;
the doctor was surrounded by some half a score&#xD;
angry lumbermen. At this juncture one of them&#xD;
shouted-&#xD;
"Throw 'him off the bridge!"&#xD;
"Right! right 1" exclaimed others. "Didn't he&#xD;
stab Lynde?"&#xD;
"And shoot Morris' Farr ?"&#xD;
"And deceive the minister ?"&#xD;
The trembling wretch was now hurried aw&amp;amp;y towaids&#xD;
the bridge. Knowing the certain doom that awaited&#xD;
him, without some more powerful interference than 'I&#xD;
could' command, I begged th~ innkeeper t&amp;amp; run for&#xD;
Allan GraysoD, while I hurried home to apprize my&#xD;
father and Griffiths of what was going on. ,B~th had.&#xD;
one to the forge. Despatchin~ Jerry for them, at the&#xD;
op of his speed, I in'et the lumbermen at a short dis~&#xD;
stance above, the bridge.&#xD;
"Let him go, Sam," I said to Saxt~n. "You have&#xD;
no proofs of his guilt, and you surely wouldn't kill an&#xD;
innocent man I"&#xD;
"Get out o' my way!"&#xD;
" Remember how nearly you had murdere&amp;amp;me."&#xD;
"Yes, I do ; '~but this 'ere's a villain as don't deserve&#xD;
to live."&#xD;
"That is for the jury to sa~y, Sam."&#xD;
"Boys, jest take Lynde away, will ye ?" said Sam,&#xD;
~ho still retained his hold of Dodge.&#xD;
"Here comes minister !" exclaimed one.&#xD;
Before Allan GraysoA could reach the spot, the&#xD;
lumbermen, to the 'i~umber, perhaps,' of twezity, had&#xD;
dragged their victim upon the bridge, and when the&#xD;
clergyman came; his remonstrances 'were unheeded&#xD;
"There comeS Uncle 'George !" tried one of the&#xD;
crowd, and; hearing this, the enragedd lumbermen were&#xD;
lifting the struggling man to the railing ef' the -bridge.&#xD;
My father 'had" already reached it. By; this time the&#xD;

the bridge broke in the middLe, and fell .with a loud&#xD;
plash into the river. The parts, of the bridge swung&#xD;
patiently round, so that~ the ends were not more than&#xD;
thirty feet from the shora.,. The 8hor.t. plazi~ks. which&#xD;
composed. the footing of the bridge. fell from it and&#xD;
floated away, and thus there was no way to reach the&#xD;
three persons who were clinging to the extremity near-&#xD;
est the eastern shore. As the bridge swung round,&#xD;
we~..discoiered that I~odge was clinging ~to the iron&#xD;
railing, while his body was under. the :surface of the&#xD;
water. Sam Saxton was clinging to him, and to Sam&#xD;
his crony Bill Ferguson. wa~ holding, by the skirt of&#xD;
his huge lumbern~an's. coats With such a current it&#xD;
was linpossibie that Dodges could long ~ustain his own&#xD;

to those who weVe clinging~ to him. ~Phe lower one&#xD;

cured a rope. This was attached to the boat. Two of&#xD;
the lumbermen leaped into it, and ere they coul&amp;amp;'reach&#xD;
the end of the b~idge~ it was swamped by the furious&#xD;
current, and the noble fellows were lost. One of them&#xD;
had been noted for his piety, ~nd he sang, as he floated&#xD;
awaythe air and words of a favouiite hymn.,&#xD;
It was plain that t~odge was n&amp;amp;w wellnigh exhausted.&#xD;
His companionn' though he had not ,su~ci~nt strength&#xD;
to c2imb over hint and reach the bridge, still clung, to&#xD;
him witlitho desperate grasp of a drowning man. . We&#xD;
could see that Dodge was trying to shake. hiz~ o~ and&#xD;
that he was expostulating with him. The poor fellow&#xD;
at last let. go his hold, and ])odge made~ an eitort to&#xD;
