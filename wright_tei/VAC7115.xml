timable John Perkins took the child into his house, placed it in his&#xD;
housekeeper's arms and told her that, as he didn't know but he might&#xD;
adopt it as his own son (provided the parental Muttons were not&#xD;
found), he wished her to be kind to it, and (simple-hearted John!)&#xD;
give it plenty to eat and drink, accordingly.&#xD;

TIMOTHY TUQG MUTTOIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
About this time, another youth, younger and yet more diminutive&#xD;
than Timothy, whose name ws   lhdrley ragg, (or was to be,&#xD;
when he became old enough) and whose age was hard on to four&#xD;
weIslikewieinabited Blinkille.&#xD;
Scragg, unlike Mutton, had a father, and ifwe ieeiber right-&#xD;
ly, a mother also. This, however, is not material. Charley's&#xD;
father,2Ebenezar Archibald Scragg, was at that time the great man&#xD;
o Blinkville, the head and front of all offending, defending, pre-&#xD;
tending, contending, suspending, expending and everything else of&#xD;
a public nature. He was very fat and comfortable looking, so was"&#xD;
his bank account'; in fact, he Avas very rich in two ways-rich in&#xD;
worldly goods, and just as rich in what worldly goods can't pur-&#xD;
chase-health and spirits. Of his ancestry, nothing need be said&#xD;
--in truth, nothing can be said, for nothing is clearly known, and&#xD;
it is scarcely ;worth while to argue as to their former existence,&#xD;
when such an inference is natural. 'Moreover, ancestry, In oitr&#xD;
Republican land is ofno importance whatever, and, furthermore,&#xD;
the ancestors of Squire Scragg have not the slightest bearing upon&#xD;
the history of Mutton:&#xD;
Nancy, the rosy house-keeper of John Ierkins, agreed, with&#xD;
much seeming cheerfulness, to do as John requested, although she&#xD;
didn't like it, and we can't blame her, for it happened that she had&#xD;
just entered into a matrimonial engagement with  din h; (ceremony&#xD;
to come eff in six weeks) and, of course, she had her own expeEta-&#xD;
tions. However, she called the child a little'lamb, and aA for the&#xD;
next ensuing twelve months, she treated it admirably well ; this&#xD;
little lamb grew to be one of the stoutest Muttons of his age, in&#xD;
those or any other parts.&#xD;

CHAPTER THE SECOND.&#xD;
A QUARREL.&#xD;
The reader will please imagine that he has been travelling along&#xD;
with Old Time, on a ten years' tour of observat-ion, and that dur-&#xD;
ing these ten years, things have occurred in various parts of the&#xD;
world, which gave peace and happiness to some, white hairs and&#xD;
broken hearts to others, being to many, the grave to thousands. He&#xD;
will imagine the many poetic truths that might be written of a ten&#xD;
years' lapse of time, for, at present, we are not sufficiently at lei-&#xD;
sure to think of them.&#xD;
Timothy Tugg Mutton has become "the most graceless young&#xD;
varmint that ever wore out shoe leather," at least, so Mrs. Nancy&#xD;
Perkins tells her neighbors. But Mrs. Nancy may be prejudiced,&#xD;
for, although she and John have a son of their own, (that half na-&#xD;
ked six year old chap, who is paddling in the horse-trough,) John&#xD;
nevertheless clings to- Mutton and won't let him be sent away and&#xD;
bound to that hard-hearted farmer who lives a mile up the lane.&#xD;
John can't see why Mutton should leave him at all, for his (John's)&#xD;
house is roomy, his acres broad, his wealth increasing daily, and,&#xD;
moreover, says kind John, "I've taken a great liking to the boy,&#xD;
and where's the use 2" Strong as this argument wan, it failed to&#xD;
convince Mrs. Nancy, as in fact, was the case with every argu-&#xD;
ment lie ventured to advance. She would have her own way, and&#xD;
she asserted her prerogative in all things so determinedly, that her&#xD;
husband, being a peace-loving man, invariably gave way. Invaria-&#xD;
bly? No! He wouldn't send away Mutton.&#xD;
But where is this juvenile--this grand human apex of domestic&#xD;
contention ? At this time, he ought to be in the village school stud-&#xD;
ying hard, but, instead of being there, he is with Charley Seragg&#xD;
behind the old barn, engaged in tying an antiquated tin kettle to&#xD;
Mrs.-Nancy's cat's tail.- Look at the precious couple I Tim is very&#xD;
good-looking in the face, and is very tall for his age, though an im-&#xD;
mense deal too thin for his height, while Charley is exceedingly&#xD;
short and exceeds in circumference his perpendicular admeasure-&#xD;

ment. Doubtless, t way=with a: iew to their personal appearance&#xD;
that the boys at school gave the latter the -subriquet of "Mutton&#xD;
Scragg," and the former that of the "seragg of Mutton." And such&#xD;
a lot of precocious youngsters that got whipped by masters Mutton&#xD;
and Scragg for making use of these queer-sounding appellations !&#xD;
But all invain: Tim in the rerembrances of his early companions,&#xD;
was-never anything hut a'Sci'agg of Mutton."&#xD;
And such friends as were Tifand Charley! Talk of Damon and&#xD;
Pythius! Damon wouldn't have ddne half as much for Pythins, or&#xD;
Pythius for Damhn, as Tin would have done for Charley, or Char-&#xD;
ley for ;'im. Charley couldn't, place a crook'd pin upon the old&#xD;
schoolmaster's easy chair, without first getting Tim to inspect the&#xD;
:point ; nor could Ti blow snuff into a. school mate's eyes, with-&#xD;
out getting Charley to steady the hollow reed whikh contained it.&#xD;
Hear the young rascals laugh I-See that maddened, miserable cat&#xD;
dashing along,:heltet'skelter, with that antiquated tin kettle fasten-&#xD;

John Perkins- was in his  comfortable sitting room drawing out&#xD;
the plan of a new waggon house, and his gentle helpmate was sit-&#xD;
ting in her rocking-chair near-him ; holding the dairy maid through&#xD;
the door which conniunicated with the kitchen. Whether it was,&#xD;
}n account of the heat'of the room, or on aoeount of the arimth of&#xD;
his better half's temper, we never learned, but John rose up as if&#xD;
to open the window before him, when in dashed the'cat with much&#xD;
hubbub and yelling, shatteing the glass, upsetting the ink, be-&#xD;
spattering. the paper and demolishing poor Perkins' nose with a&#xD;
corner of the antiquated kettle."&#xD;
"Look at the state of this cat"--"cried Mrs. Nany.&#xD;
"Look at the;state of my nose;" interrupted John.&#xD;
"Blow your nose," shouted"Mrs. Nancy-not that sie meant it&#xD;

"I'll submit to this no longer," continued Mrs. Perkins, "my&#xD;
very heart bleeds."&#xD;
"My nose certainly does," murmured John.&#xD;
"What's that you say?" questioned Nancy, angrily.&#xD;
"Nothing, my dear," answered John, meekly.&#xD;
"Don't 'dear' me, John Perkins," exclaimed Mrs. Nancy, as&#xD;
she put down the cat, and brushed the wrinkles off her apron&#xD;
(without thinking of the deeper ones which ill-temper was marking&#xD;
on her brow) "don't 'dear' me. Gracious kntws there's precious&#xD;
little love you have for me, precious little. But I will be mistress&#xD;
in my own house, and I'll send that nasty, little, meddling, good-&#xD;
for-nothing varlet packing, before I am a day older, now I tell you.&#xD;
I'll be imposed upon no longer, U'm determined."&#xD;
John, during this harangue, had resumed work upon his waggon-&#xD;
house plan, and had drawn two lines, one horizontal to describe the&#xD;
foundation, and the other perpendicular to describe the south-east&#xD;
corner post. But his wife's vehemence caused him to make a mis-&#xD;
take and he took out a knife to repair it. The difficulty was that&#xD;
he had drawn the corner post beneath the foundation, instead of&#xD;
over it.&#xD;
"Do you hear me, John Perkins ?" asked Mrs. Nancy.&#xD;
"Of course, I do, Nancy !" said John with his customary mild-&#xD;
ness. "You needn't talk so loud, my dear."&#xD;
"I told you before, not to 'dear' me," shouted Mrs. Perkins, and&#xD;
she gave the poor cat (who had jumped upon her lap and creased&#xD;
her apron again,) a blow that sent her half way across the room-&#xD;
"keep your 'dears' for the woman who put that brat at your gate.&#xD;
Precious good right she had to do it, I dare say."&#xD;
"What do you mean by that ?" asked John, suddenly looking&#xD;
her in the face.&#xD;
"Mean ?" cried Nancy, vehemently-"mean ? Why I mean that&#xD;
I am of old Kringle's opinion, as tq who's the father of that boy-&#xD;
and I just want to tell you now, that if my house is to be the har-&#xD;
bor of all your-." -Mrs.Perkins stopped suddenly, for her&#xD;
husband's eyes were fixed upon her with an expression she never&#xD;
afterwards forgot. In spite of herself, she cowed beneath that in-&#xD;

gant, "for what you've said to me, whom you know better, had you&#xD;
been a han, I'd have strangled you, but, thank-heaven ! you are a&#xD;
wmnanthough an rring one, and your sex protects you. You are&#xD;
nMy wife, and not even your ill-temper, which I've born with pa-&#xD;
tiently' for many a past day, can'cause me to forget the bond bet.&#xD;

me tell you that PI1 have my way hereafter, in peace and quiet, or&#xD;
you or I must leave this house forever. Have you no charityP&#xD;
Have you no fear of that 'Saviour who coinmanded all his creatures&#xD;
to observe it ih their dealings with their fellow men? We are rich&#xD;
and prosperous, and it would be strange, indeed, if we could not&#xD;
spare a little for a poor defenceless orphan."&#xD;
Nancy was subdued. Her empire was dissolvedSher high horse&#xD;
demolished-she burst into tears !&#xD;
Her husband tried to feel p erfectly callous, for he thought, per..&#xD;
haps, the lesson was not complete, but it would not do.--Stern as&#xD;
he was when roused, he was not proof againsta woman's tears,&#xD;
specially when those tears were  videnuc of the birth of better&#xD;
feelings in that woman's heart, that woman, too,his wife. He Went-&#xD;
softly to where she sat and took her hand. And then he whisper-&#xD;
ed gently, that the voWs they had made at the altar, were heard by&#xD;
the saie great Judge before whom'all had to bow when being&#xD;
ceased, that to tamper with that sacred band, was to sin most deep..&#xD;
ly. And stealing through her heart she felt a new emotion, and&#xD;
throwing'hetself upon' her husband's breast, she kissed him, and&#xD;
both sobbed audibly!&#xD;

CHAPTER THE THIRD.&#xD;
0SUTs.&#xD;
When the cat started on her gallop, Tim and Charley started af-&#xD;
ter her to witness the result. If the truth were told, it would be&#xD;
found that Tim and Charley, by hurling large stones after the per-&#xD;
secuted animal, and putting forth sundry and divers yelpings, like&#xD;
those of dogs, caused her to make for the sitting-room window, as&#xD;
the only positive avenue of escape. It has already been seen that&#xD;
this truly feline idea resulted most wonderfUlly. As a matter of&#xD;
course, glass was shattered, ink was spilled, paper bespattered,&#xD;
and poor Perkins' nose demolished by the corner of the antiquated&#xD;
kettle. Then the skgimatrimonial became darkly overcast, and a&#xD;
storm came up with a deal of thunder and lightning disguised as&#xD;
language. And then a bolt struck, and was'followed by a counter-&#xD;
bolt, and a shower succeeded, turbulent at first, but calming gra-&#xD;
dually, till finally the sky grew brighter far than ever with a pro-&#xD;
mise visible in the new-born light, of lasting peace and absence of&#xD;
contention.&#xD;
Tim and Charley listened til the storm wan t its height, when&#xD;
fearing to stay' longer, lest it should overtake them too, they ran&#xD;
down the valley and sat together beneath a tree by the side of a&#xD;
brook, a little wandering thing with crystal waters, which went&#xD;
murmuring on in their weak way, till the tall old' trees which stood&#xD;
around the house in which the paternalfSragg and his twin children&#xD;
lived so peacefully, hid them from the view. It should be very&#xD;
happy, this- tiny brook, in' the bright valley. froniwhose bosom it&#xD;
springs forth, for it is sweetly shaded by fragrant :shrubs and beau-&#xD;
teous wild flowers, which ever andanon bow down their heads to&#xD;
court its kisses. And it is useful too, this tiny brook, for the thirsty&#xD;
flocksrand cattle of 'the farm:stop herer to drink its pure cool. wa-&#xD;

"Charley," said Tim, in a smothered tone, and with much hesi-&#xD;
tation and pausing : "It's all up,-now, so it is."&#xD;
"What's up, Tim ?" asked Charley, for he didn't comprehend&#xD;
either  the  ineaninfo r m ianinr  of his  companionWg e&#xD;

"Well; that's nothit g'said h.rley stoically, not that-he meant&#xD;

'It's a good deal," said 'Tim, and he didn't appear to be at all&#xD;

even louder than before..;"He's a good man," continued he, "and&#xD;

suppress, burst forth in torrents now, and filing dQwn upon the&#xD;
long grass blades, hung there glistening '&#xD;

should care for harsh words that were not addressed to him. He&#xD;
turned the matter over and over again in his mind, but could not&#xD;

"Tim! let me go with you!" cried Charley, suddenly, as if elat-&#xD;
ed by the idea.&#xD;
But Tim told Charley that it wouldn't do;' that people would&#xD;
say ke had doaxed-himir away, -and that they, might send strongR men&#xD;
after them, who would beat them cruelly and bring Them back&#xD;
again' 'And he tald himt too, in his childish way,.'that there were&#xD;
plenty-'who loved hin down'at his house, and if hewent away&#xD;
they'd take on dreadfully. -'And (Charley glanced down the-valley&#xD;

that they then would again become' good friends and bo6irades, as&#xD;
they were now. And then, they'threw- their arms' around etch&#xD;

CHAPTER -THE FOURTH.&#xD;
THE TEMPTATION.&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, no, I dare not!. Leave me, leave me, for the love of&#xD;
heaven.",&#xD;
The speaker was a female; youthful, for her age was but eight.&#xD;
een; beautiful, for she was the reigning star of the constellated cir-&#xD;
cle in which she moved.; rich, for she was wedded to a man whose&#xD;
means were boundless ; happy she should .be, too, for her husband&#xD;
worshipped her as a being of celestial light:--he bore for hera-love&#xD;
so exquisite in its sensibility, that, did the slightest shade, start&#xD;
o'er her brow, a treble darkness crept about his heart and'chilled&#xD;
it to the core. And yet, he felt, she did not love him i-and this&#xD;
thought, at last, became a-haunting demon, (that flitted across his&#xD;
mental vision in the quiet, shadowy night, and in the busy, sun-lit&#xD;
day, and never left him even momentary peace. And often, in her&#xD;
presence, he would struggle to forget it, though vainly ; for the de .&#xD;
mon never left him, but would follow, him even to his marriage bed&#xD;
and torture him! For, even from the day they stood together at the-&#xD;
altar, she was imperious and cold, and never smiled upon him. Yet,&#xD;
there was one whom she did love, in her fickle way; but the badge&#xD;
ofpoverty was about him---so, when her marriage day, was fixed,&#xD;
she cast him off, and he went wandering about the earthyuntil, as it&#xD;
was said,,he died, alone and broken-hearted!&#xD;
Her husband was a score of years her senior : but he was rich&#xD;
and, courted1i and she, though bright and beautiful, was penniless&#xD;
and lowly. Ambition crushed each gentler feeling of her heart;&#xD;
men's love it cost her little toil to win ; and -so-without a sigh&#xD;
and never thinking of the vileness of the act-she put her beauty&#xD;
up in market and SOLD it to the one who bid the highest! But, was&#xD;
she happy ? She had won all ambition craved for---the station and&#xD;
the wealth that brought around her swarms of fashionable grub-&#xD;
worms, with empty heads and callous hearts: and she shone among&#xD;
them unrivalled and peerless, admired and envied; but, in all the&#xD;

train, there was not one, who, could she have been taken from this&#xD;
miserable slough of fashionable folly, and raised again to what she&#xD;
was in her humble times gone by-a better, purer creature far,&#xD;
than she was now-that would have deigned to waste on her one-&#xD;
tithe the incense, they were offering on the altar of her chance-&#xD;
made greatness. Merton, her husband, was a MAN, an honest man,.&#xD;
a plain one; a man whose highest aim was to do good to all, of cha-&#xD;
rity untiring, for he never would believe that baseness in his fel-.&#xD;
low creatures laid deeper than the surface. And yet, she did not,&#xD;
love him! She, for whom he would have given up their little&#xD;
child, his wealth, his ALL on earth!&#xD;
It was night; Isabel Merton sat in her sumptuous chamber, and&#xD;
at her feet-must we say it?-with her hand. clasped in his, sat&#xD;
one of those moral 'lazara of society, a handsome, unblushing li-&#xD;
bertineI&#xD;
"Isabel, sweet Isabel," he murmured, "beautiful and beloved-&#xD;
nay, do not withdraw your hand;, for it is one that I would pawn&#xD;
my soul to callmy own. Let it be mine, and I swear to you by&#xD;
those, bright saints-your prototypes-by all my hopes of peace&#xD;
hereafter, by the love-pangs which rend my bosom now, I'll make&#xD;
your life one endless summer day of sunny brightness, one varying&#xD;
crowding train of joys, so rapturous, that a thought of the base&#xD;
outside world, with its dull cares and miseries, can never find its&#xD;
way into the circle which our love will render sacred. Say, sweet,&#xD;
beautiful, beloved Isabel, say shall it not be so ?"&#xD;
And he clasped her hand more warmly, and gazed upon, her&#xD;
face with his deep unfathomable eyes, as though his very life hung&#xD;
trembling upon lips that in opening might destroy it. And Isabel's&#xD;
heart beat passionately, and an impulse came to throw herself into&#xD;
her lover's arms, and weep, and tell him she was his.. Did she&#xD;
resist it? YES !&#xD;
"No, no," she cried, "I-dare not. Leave me, leave me, for the&#xD;
"You do not love me then ?" he said.&#xD;
But she made no answer, for she was suffering deeply.,&#xD;

toward the doorybut turning, with:his hand upon the latch, to look&#xD;
at her again: he saw, as he expected, her eyes directed after him&#xD;
With a saddened beseeching glance, and the large tears chasing&#xD;
each other down.her cheeks. He rushed back quickly.&#xD;
"You love me then," he cried, "though I feared that I was,&#xD;
scorned.- Oh, happiness! those tears are far more precious to me&#xD;
than the fabled flower from whose half-openedpetals drop the sa-&#xD;
cred waters of immortality. Oh, should we then-we;, that love,&#xD;
each other fondly as we do-care for aught else beside the joys.&#xD;
that mutual love will;give? Or should, the ebld and heartless:&#xD;
world, that in your wedded state-a-barrier of formality alone-"&#xD;
"Cease, Clinton," exclaimed Isabel, "I dare not hear you fur-&#xD;
ther. That barrier does exist, and to break it by my own act would&#xD;
be to plunge- into an abyss of shame, from which .I never more&#xD;
could rise.  My husband loves me, though I love him not, he is&#xD;
faithful to ine, and, while he yet remains so, I'll not dishonor him.&#xD;
Reflect upon the step you:have,,proposed, its consequence to me-&#xD;
to be the, jeer and byword of the town! Qh, Edmund,, be content&#xD;
to know that unutterably well I love you, and the day may come,&#xD;

then, with increased.agitation, articulated faintly, "some one has&#xD;
entered the house--for Heaven's sake, begone."&#xD;
He listened for a moment. "It must have been a servant then,"&#xD;
he said.&#xD;
"Perhaps my husband! Go, go, quickly !"&#xD;
"Three days, at least, he was to have been absent, so you said,"&#xD;
and Clinton tried to re-assure her with a smile.&#xD;
"Something may have occurred to bring him back," she gasped,&#xD;
for she really thought ,that Ruin, glaring and hideous, was staring,&#xD;
her in the face. "Caroline will contrive to let you out. Fly, and&#xD;
save me, while there is yet a chance !"&#xD;
'And if'it is not  he," he whispered, "when shall we meet&#xD;

he stole softly from the room and house ; but when in the street, he&#xD;
paused and looked up at the window of a chamber fi-om which a&#xD;
light was gleaming.&#xD;
"No noise," he thought, "she is still alone, and likely to remain&#xD;
so. I was a fool to let a woman's fancies startle me."&#xD;
But no sooner had he gone than Isabel felt all the strength she&#xD;
had assumed deserting her, and sh'e'fell faihting to the floor.&#xD;
And Clinton knew not this, though he still stood gazing at the&#xD;

CHAPTER THE FIFTH,&#xD;
THE WAGER.&#xD;
"Holloa, Ned!" cried one of a party of young midnight brawlers,&#xD;
as he clapped Clinton familiarly on the shoulder, "What the devil&#xD;
are you doing here, staring up at old Merton's windows, eh ? Are&#xD;
you waiting in hopes of getting a glimpse of his lovely wife, en die.-.&#xD;
habille, or has she granted you an interview, sub rose, for which&#xD;
you are awaiting the signal ? Come, now -confess."&#xD;
"You jump rather hastily to conclusions, Fred," said another of&#xD;
the party. "Althoughan inveterate coquette, Mrs.Metoh is not&#xD;
the woman, to grant midnight interviews to-conparative strangers&#xD;
~ among us, particularly during her husband's absence."&#xD;
"That's the very time," exclaimed the young man called -Fred,&#xD;
"the very time for all the world."&#xD;
"But not for men of whom we know as little as we dc of" Mr.&#xD;
Clinton," returned the other.&#xD;

THE WAGER.&#xD;
&#xD;
Perhaps,-Mr. Walters speaks advisedly," said Clinton sneering-&#xD;
ly. And Walters was greatly nettled at his tone, the more so, be-&#xD;
cause he both suspected and disliked him, and had not, like the rest,&#xD;
permitted a snnooth tongue and a polished exterior to win him over.&#xD;
"I speak, sei," he retorted, "as becomes agman to speak, when&#xD;
he hears a lady's honor uselessly called in question."&#xD;
"Then you are confident of this lady's,&#xD;
So confident, sir," answered Walters, "that I would stake my&#xD;
ny life upon it!" for he was carried beyond all bounds by the in-&#xD;
suiting coolness of the other's manner.&#xD;
"Your life, sir," exclaimed the libertine, in a tone which by no&#xD;
means restored the other's good humor. "The stake is too vast&#xD;
-I have nothing wherewith to cover it. Stake something tangible,&#xD;
and I am your man, that her virtue is not invulnerable."&#xD;
"Mr. Clinton," answered Walters, with forced calmness, "I feel&#xD;
that such an affair is utterly unworthy of a gentleman, yet, in or-&#xD;
der that the arrogance of your pretensions may receive a salutary&#xD;
and merited rebuke, I will waive the feelings of delicacy which--"&#xD;
"I fully appreciate the feelings of delicacy which you profess,"&#xD;
interrupted Clinton, "but I must beg that you will come to the&#xD;
point. Dare you bet?",&#xD;
Walters' face became almost scarlet,---"Sir," he exclaimed, "I&#xD;
will bet you-five thousand dollars that you cannot obtain an inter-&#xD;
view with Mrs. Merton in the solitude of her bed-chamber, at&#xD;
night, or at any time within three days, provided that underhand or&#xD;
compulsory measures are not resorted to."&#xD;
"Gentlemen!.gentlemen!" cried another of the party, "this af.&#xD;
fiir is becoming serious.. Let it rest here, I beg."&#xD;
"I accept the wager," said Clinton, "and agree to the proviso.&#xD;
Gentlemen, you are all witnesses to the compact."&#xD;
"But," asked Fred, "how will it be decided?"  °&#xD;
"Easily," answered'Clinton. i "And I will not only 'with fair&#xD;
dealing, obtain a private interview with the lady in her own cham-&#xD;
ber, but she shall voluntarily consent to become mine."&#xD;
"Buttthe proof M  .&#xD;

"And now, sir," said Waiteis,'with a. glance of mortal enmity at&#xD;
his opponent, "now  that-this honorable wager has been discussed&#xD;
in all its bearings, permit me, sir, to say, that for the insole-nce of&#xD;
your demeanor towards me on this and past Occasions,; as well&#xD;
as the deliberate and cowardly insult you have offered to a&#xD;
lady I knew from childhood, and esteemed, I shall demand at the&#xD;
expiration of three days, the satisfaction of a gentleman.&#xD;
"'Certainlyj sir, certainly," answered Clinton flippantly. "You&#xD;
shall have all the satisfaction I can give you, as soon as I return to&#xD;
town ; but you really must allow me more than these three days.&#xD;
It would not be courteous, you know, or complimentary to the la-&#xD;
dy, were I to discard her in so short a time. Mr. Walters, adieu&#xD;
jusqu' au revoir. Gentlemen, all, good night, and don't forget the&#xD;
wager."   And the villain turned upon his heel and sauntered cil&#xD;
whistling carelessly.&#xD;
"By my soul, I'm sorry this thing has occurred," warmly ex-&#xD;
claimed the young man, who had spoken against the mak ing of the&#xD;
wager, for I fear it will have a result we all will long regret."&#xD;
"Clinton will lose, depend upon it," said another.&#xD;
"No," exclaimed Fred, "he'll win."&#xD;
"And if he does," muttered Walters, with his teeth set firmly,&#xD;
"he dies."&#xD;
&#xD;
The third hour of the morning had passed away, yet Edmund&#xD;
Clinton, as though each moment was of vital import, still sat plan-&#xD;
ning and plotting in his chamber.&#xD;
"There ! that will get him out the way," he muttered. "And&#xD;
now for Isabel. Force will not do-let me think. She says her&#xD;
husband is faithful to her, and that while heyet remains so she'll&#xD;
not dishonor him. Why, my course is clear l I'll have a.letter writ-&#xD;

"My dear Ned :T--Business obliged me to leave town on the 24th,&#xD;
quite unexpectedly, and consequentLfy I couId not tall upon you at&#xD;
yourrooms, as I had promised.. I should have written you; an O;pol-.&#xD;
ogy, but ,had but a few minutes time to prepare for my departure.&#xD;
.However,,let this sufficer-I shall be back in a week= at fur-.&#xD;
thest, meanwhile let "our set" become possessed of these facts, or&#xD;
they'll think.I have committed matrimony, or drowned myself, or&#xD;
something of that desperately agreeable nature.&#xD;
"By the way, you know old Merton ? I caught him finely, just&#xD;
.before -Ieat, -and the thing will furnish excellent food for scandal,&#xD;
and may bepalatably dished up for all glsses  gWould you think&#xD;
it ? Instead of, being in Schenectady, as his pretty wife believes,&#xD;
he is cozily domiciled with an interesting little creature, at that&#xD;
very same house, (if you rememberit),'in which you, during a&#xD;
former visit to our :town, risked ygur life'.to 'save. an unfortunate&#xD;
country lass, who had been decoyed there by a demon in the shape&#xD;
of man. I am surprised at Merton, and had Iinot seen him with&#xD;
the woman, would never have believed it. Go and satisfy your-&#xD;
self--it will pay you 'for the trouble. Yout cousinand friend,&#xD;

"Most of people hive cousins, muttered the letter writer ;: "why&#xD;
should t I 'have one.; Stop, I inuat add a postsoript.'&#xD;
"If the thing has not got'cut before you receive this, for his un,&#xD;
fortnateie wife's sake, you had better ,say nothing 'abriut it.'&#xD;

interview with Isabel and place this letter in her hands. There is&#xD;
little fear she'll tax him with it, or even breathe a single doubt that&#xD;
he would hear, but on the other hand, she has begun to hate him&#xD;
so sincerely, that she will grasp with eagerness at any thing that&#xD;
will keep her conscience quiet. But I'll go to bed, for I've' much&#xD;
to do to-morrow."&#xD;
It was then' to-morrow, though not yet day-the to-morrow that&#xD;
two hours after spread -its broad light about the, world. And be-&#xD;
fore retiring, the conspirator again read the two letters'he had writ-&#xD;
ten, and he smiled and chuckled over them as though he had done&#xD;
an honorable thing that would confer peace and happiness on all&#xD;
within the circle of his influence.&#xD;
And slowly crept that day away, and seemed to the husband in&#xD;
his absence, and to the lover and to the wife, in their impatience,&#xD;
as though 'twould never end.&#xD;
And night came on again, but Richard Merton still was absent&#xD;
from his glittering but empty-hearted home-absent from her he&#xD;
loved so tenderly and well--absent, when her salvation, and his&#xD;
own earthly peace hung trembling in the balance.&#xD;
Where did he linger ?&#xD;

male, entered the house&#xD;
Anon, =behold hi-iratheohramber of the 'erring ,wife-not at her&#xD;
feet, 'as 'hereAfore,'but sittingboldly by her side, and pouring into&#xD;
her eais4heh onied woids ofrhisdisreputable passion.  -&#xD;
And -yit despite the: love she thoughtshe bore for him despite&#xD;
her effortssto forgetall ,save the impassioned pleadertat her side-&#xD;
spite of herself-her husband's image rose up from themis't of eor-&#xD;
rupting inaerieies drotind, And. terrified her. ,And eshnaniid the&#xD;
whirl;of kher eideIted'fa noies,:She thought of Mertoa'sJove. for heir-&#xD;
so-boundless and unchanging, his goodness an'd:his unstained life,&#xD;
enda little ad6iitor within hec boso rwou ld whisper, 'he is faith-&#xD;
ful to hee-do-not disbandribi!&#xD;
-  adeachsthought ' tedpl i iy;ut, wpoiher fhie; ami Clnton&#xD;
read it. And whe'neer She -,ominiined most ea'rnestl , With her&#xD;
better self, he seemed to feel that he was.losing ground, and, fix-&#xD;
ing his dark tempter eyes on hers, would break into a new strain&#xD;
of doubly-impassioned eloquence. But the little monitor within&#xD;
her bosoni whispered still, "he is faithful to thee-do not dishonor&#xD;
him!"j&#xD;
Then Clinton spoke of what would be her lot were she but his.&#xD;
How he would cherish her in sickness' and in health, and never&#xD;
leave her side. How hewoud -he her-slave, and anticipate her&#xD;
every wish, even before 'twas formed. How in some fairer land&#xD;
to which they'd fly, she should outshine the brightest jewel of the&#xD;
social coronet, eclipsing even dames of noblest ancestry. And then,&#xD;
contrasting such a lot with the poor, rayless, present one, he urged&#xD;
her to a choice ; but, again, the little monitor sent up its whisper-&#xD;
ed warning, "he is faithful to thee-do not dishonor him."&#xD;
And even as if he had heard the very whispered words within&#xD;
her bosom, the tempter said; "Oh, my beloved!l you drive me to&#xD;

upon the weakness of another I must build, or perish."&#xD;
"What do you mean ? she; asked; starting as though alarmed.&#xD;
"Sweet Isabel," murmured he, "upon my knees I beg forgive-&#xD;
ness, if I offcndi but see, I am a struggling, dying wretch, and will&#xD;
you blame me, if I, to save myself, should bring- destruction on&#xD;
another?"&#xD;
"Still ambiguous," she said, and'her emotions a very child might&#xD;
have interpreted, so palpable they were, "Speak plainly-whom&#xD;
do you mean. Do you not see how I am suffering ' Is it my hus-&#xD;
band?"&#xD;
"Yes," answered Clinton, slowly, as if with reluctancy and&#xD;
pain.&#xD;
"Well, well," resumed Isabel, impatiently, "what of him? speak!&#xD;
answer ! keep me no longer in suspense."&#xD;
"Yes, I must speak," he said, "but Isabel, do me the justice to&#xD;
believe that I would have scorned to tell you this.for the advance-&#xD;
ment of my own purposes, alone, and therefore I have kept this&#xD;
knowledge from you, lest  -"&#xD;
She.started from her seat.&#xD;
"What knowledge? Would you drive me mad??'&#xD;
"The knowledge of your husband's infidelity!"&#xD;
"To what? to whom?"&#xD;
"To You !"&#xD;
She stood asif transfinedI! Her husband false to HER!I to her,&#xD;
before whose footstool,(those who paid their court to her declared)&#xD;
monarchs would not feel it derogation of their majesty to bend!I To&#xD;
her-her husband false to her I Impossible.&#xD;
But he placed the written "proof" within her hands, and she&#xD;
fixed her eyes upon it and read it gaspingly. And when he said&#xD;
that he, too,'had been-there, and saw with liis' own eyes her hus-&#xD;
band's perfidy, she could not doubt, for 'she believed the bribe of&#xD;
countless worlds could never move her lover to a lie.&#xD;
Her husband false' to her!&#xD;

gloryand the whole fabric -of her pride toppled headlong and ruin.&#xD;
ously downs&#xD;
"And now, sweet.Isabel," murmured the human viper at her&#xD;
feet, "will you: still scorn my faithful love, for' the base second&#xD;
thoughts of-one who but professes love to cloak his perfidy ?"&#xD;
And every word .became engraven op her heart as, it fell from&#xD;
his false lips, though she made-no sign nor token that she heard.&#xD;
And once more he arose, and would have clasped her in his arms,&#xD;
but she pushed him rudely off and stood there, proud and unbend-&#xD;
ing, as though  she had determined while she remained within that&#xD;
house," she still would reign its queen.&#xD;
"Isabel!" cried Clinton, "you surprise me. Be yourself. Time&#xD;
flies. I have avery thing prepared-let us go hence at once."&#xD;
"False to me," exclaimed Isabel. "Oh, heaven! that ever I had&#xD;
put it in the pwer"of 'man to say he has been false to me. But&#xD;
I'll go now, yes, yes, I'll go"&#xD;
"Oh, my beloved," cried Clinton, "the transports with which&#xD;
yourwords have-ilhed my breast--..&#xD;
"Peace, Clinton,' interrupted Isabel, "I feel no transports here.&#xD;
And with my hand upon my heart, I call heaven to: witness that&#xD;
the sole motive which impels me to this step, is to be avenged,&#xD;
amply avenged upon the Oman who dared make m  a cloak for such&#xD;
unblushing infamy."&#xD;
"Isabel!" cried Clinton, with a start,-and he was really startled:&#xD;
for her last words revealed a feature in her character which skil-&#xD;
fully ,as he had read hei', he did not dream existed. He thought&#xD;
her but a 'ain, proud creature, with a heart on which 'new images&#xD;
were constantly impressed ; but, never did it occur to him that by&#xD;
wounding that heart through its thick covering of pride, she might&#xD;
become a very giantess in mental strength, and prostrate all who&#xD;
wronged hers&#xD;
Leave me now, Clinton," she exclaimed, at length,. "forI am&#xD;
not myself. ,Return here in:an, hour, or less, and I will be prepar-,&#xD;
ed. Do with   e.a; syou will when I have'eft this house; take me&#xD;
where you please, and treat me as you plase, for I am wholly&#xD;
&#xD;
There was still a strange light gleaming from her eyes,- and he&#xD;
well knew it would be better to leave her to herself, as she request-&#xD;
ed. So he took her hand respectfully and fondly, and pressed his&#xD;
lips to it, and said, that in an hour he would return, and they never&#xD;
more would separate.&#xD;
And long after he had gone, she stood immbveable upon the same&#xD;
spot, 'usy with thought. Every pastaction of her life was now&#xD;
remembered, even from childhood. And she thought sadly of the&#xD;
true heart whom, for his poverty, she had cast off as her marriage&#xD;
day drew near, and of his having gone wandering about the earth&#xD;
and dying early, as 'twas reported, alone and broken-hearted. But&#xD;
the winter-time of her repentance was to come.&#xD;
At length, the door again opened, and a beautiful young girl en-&#xD;
tered the chamber.&#xD;
In stature, she was slightly above the medium size and most admir-&#xD;
ably proportioned, but it was her face, :more than her figure-ele-&#xD;
gant though it was-that arrested the, attention of the beholder.&#xD;
Her eyes were black as a starless night, and equally as unfathom-&#xD;
able, her nose and mouth were most exquisitely chiseled, yet there&#xD;
was a something that marred the general expression, which some-&#xD;
thing, though neither inelegant or repulsive, was, nevertheless, a&#xD;
slight detraction from what other wise would have been most glo-&#xD;
rious beauty. It was the sensuality of the countenance, betraying,&#xD;
as it did, ardent desires and inextinguishable passions. But it&#xD;
was evident that the station she held in this house she was by no&#xD;
means designed for., Her mistress, however, knew nothing fur-&#xD;
ther of her than that Clinton recommended her to her as a waiting&#xD;
maid, she being, as he told Isabel, a girl of respectable parentage,&#xD;
who had met with sad reverses. But it was to abet him in his&#xD;
designs that Clinton desired the employment of the girl, and she&#xD;
had a motive for agreeing to serve him thus. She was his door-&#xD;
opener, his go-between, his spy, and she seemed to be a most wil-&#xD;
ling instrument.&#xD;
Isabel started when this girl entered.-."Why did. you not&#xD;
knock?" she demanded, imperiously.&#xD;

"Excuse me, madam," said the girl, "but I thought you might&#xD;
have occasion for my services."&#xD;
"Your services; exclaimed Isabel, "at this hour of night -&#xD;
"Why, yes, madant, 'answeired'the girl. "Mr. Clinton, inpass.&#xD;

"True, Caroline, I forgot," murmured poor Isabel. "Yes, I do&#xD;
require your services. Are the servants all asleep ?"&#xD;
"They are, au were Caroline. "But be not afraid, dear ma-&#xD;
dam, to'repose full confidence in me, forI would not betray one&#xD;
who has been so kind to,me for all the world. Mir. Clinton has&#xD;

Under ciicuimsances of suh a nature?  echoed Isabel. "What&#xD;

to leave the room, a smile flitted about her beautiful lips a strage&#xD;
one, a smile in which .an hundred hates, passions and purposes&#xD;
were mingled,&#xD;
And when.Isabel was again alone, again erttboughts wandered&#xD;
back to theoft forgotten past. And a. sense of loneliness And mis.&#xD;
ery shot through her brain, and then a tear started tp. her eyes,&#xD;
and was followed by another and another, till finally she threw&#xD;
herself upon a couch and wept most bitterly.&#xD;
Oh, that Merton, at:that moment, had returned!&#xD;
In another chamber, in the, sane house, a h ndsone;ent eelook-&#xD;
ing man, of some four and thirty years of age, was talking in an&#xD;
undertone with a very lovely looking girl of twenty.&#xD;
"But, you could not marry her, even if you wished' served&#xD;
the girl.             '&#xD;
"I would not marry her, even if I could," rejoined the r a,n'&#xD;
"Do you not see my plan. She is willing to become&amp;amp; oigs, without&#xD;
ceremonial or bond. Then, if I can hut put aie the hand, &#xD;
can manage to possess myself"of. the:bulk of: tht estate,. and, gonn&#xD;

"Certainly," answered Clinton. (Of course the reade; has re,&#xD;
cognized the couple.) "She would not godithott it, ' d i eses it&#xD;
is an important object in the fulfilment of my plan,. 1Qil,  ,ir-&#xD;
cumspect, my dear, and' our fortune's are ia~gdea r&#xD;
The villain then entered and walked softly along the hall which&#xD;
led to Isabel's chamber.&#xD;
The girl looked after him with flashing eyes and muttered:&#xD;
"This time, Brently, you have not deceived me!" She then went to&#xD;
the bed and taking from it an'infant,' closely muffled up, also walk--&#xD;
ed in the direction of Mrs.Merton's chamber.&#xD;
Isabel's truly lovely face was hid in Clinton's bosom, and her&#xD;
long luxuriant hair fell loosely about her polished shoulders. Even&#xD;
he, desperate, reckless villain as he was, felt so much touched, as&#xD;

now and ther'she threw the dark tresses off her brow, and looked&#xD;
upin his face in herlmute, 'tearful, helpless way, that for the time&#xD;
he lost sight of his own nature and did not speak a word.=&#xD;
But, when the girl entered the room with the infant in her arms,&#xD;
Isabel exclaimed imaploi ingly, "Dear Edmund, let it t ot be to-&#xD;
right. To-norrow night I'hall feel much more resigned."&#xD;
And Caroline smiled in'the same dark, meaning manner as be-&#xD;
fore, and coming nearer said:&#xD;
"To-morrow n'gkt your husband may be in town !"&#xD;
Isabel started :to her feet, and, in a moment, was like ice again!,&#xD;
Clinton nodded approvingly to the girl, as if she had done a no".&#xD;
ble thing. The girl smiled scornfully.&#xD;
Not another /word was said ; but, as with one hand, Isabel thiew-&#xD;
a shawl about her shoulders, with the other she motioned to the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
And when they gained the door of the, long hall she ,did not&#xD;
even look behind her, but silently crossed the threshold which but&#xD;
eighteen months before, she stepped upon, a bride. She crossed&#xD;
it now a wretched, perjured woman ; but she did not think of&#xD;
that.&#xD;
A  coach stood waiting in the street;. and Clinton would have&#xD;
helped lier in, but she motioned Caroline to take the child and en-&#xD;
ter first-then Clinton, and next she, unassisted, entered and.clos-&#xD;

But while this little party of excursionists were entering the&#xD;
coach, they did not notice in the darkness a body of men that ap-&#xD;
proached quite near them, so that bef ore the coaphmani could mount&#xD;
,      his box they were fairly up to the horses' heads.&#xD;
There may have been some eighteen or twenty men in. the party,&#xD;
but not a voice was heard or the slightest noise, except the heavy,&#xD;
solemn trampling of their feet.. Walking in the centre of,the line,&#xD;
were half a dozen pnen who bore upon their shoulders a dark ob-&#xD;
ject covered apparently with a cloak ; but what that .bject was, it&#xD;
was impossible to distinguish. At length a man, who, with the aid&#xD;
of  snall dim lantern, had been examining the plates upon the&#xD;
neighboring doors, exclaimed laconically, "Here !" and he pulled&#xD;
the bell of Merton's house long and loudly, and thew whole body&#xD;
halted. And Clinton's coachman (who, at first, for some reason of&#xD;
his own, was terribly frightened on seeing these men) inquired or&#xD;
the manwho rang the bell, "what might the matter be?" And the&#xD;
man answered that it was a "gentleman whose horse threw him,&#xD;
about three miles out, while on his. way to town ; and that they&#xD;
found him lying in the road as they were going home from work,&#xD;
and knowing him, considered it the best to bring him home at&#xD;
once.~&#xD;
Isabel, in spite of Clinton's efforts to detain her, sprang hastily&#xD;
from the carriage to the ground,' and at that moment the moon&#xD;
broke through her veil of clouds and shone with undimmed bright-&#xD;
"Is he much hurt ?" she gasped.&#xD;
"His neck was broke , ma'am,".; replied the man, as he took&#xD;
away the cloak, nsee here."&#xD;
She gave one look around-a look of horror, self-accusation and&#xD;
remorse, a shriek, wild and prolonged as though it was the despairing&#xD;
yell of an eternally lost soul, and fell senseless across--Me dead&#xD;
body of her husband.&#xD;
He had returned in time I Cold he was and lifeless, but he re-&#xD;

turned, even in death, to snatch thetbright=being whom he loved&#xD;
so madly when yet   s kind, heart, throbbed and his pulses beat&#xD;
and his eyes could-see, from the very portals of a yawning gulf-&#xD;
the terrible shades of a foul an&amp;amp; infrangible .erdition.&#xD;
And the moon went down again behind a cloud, leaving all i4&#xD;
darkness as before. But there was a seeming something in the&#xD;
very air that -was quite fearful, and the men peered gloomily&#xD;
into each other's faces, and trembled like little school boys who&#xD;
loose themselves at night, and wander through the church-yard to&#xD;
get home.&#xD;
Raise them up gently-the inanimate dead, and' the scarcely&#xD;
animate living--and if you have tears to shed for pity's .ake, let&#xD;
them fall freely, men, upon your burthens!-for him that he was&#xD;
cut off in the summer of his usefulness-.-.for her that a judgment&#xD;
has fallen on her which condemns her to years and years of bitter&#xD;
and consuming woe.&#xD;
Clinton fell back in the erriage, perfectly furious at his disap.&#xD;
pointment. It would have been pleasant to look at him, had there&#xD;
been light enough to see. , e cursed, ie beat his breast, and pul-&#xD;
led so energetically at his hair, that if Providence had. not ordained&#xD;
that he should wear his own, it would have been difcult to have&#xD;
told the consequences. (A severe cold in the, head, arising from&#xD;
exposure, would have been the least of it.) But curse as he would&#xD;
and pull as he would, it mattered little ,for in the first place, his&#xD;
prey had slipped through his firsgers, and in the second place, he&#xD;
only hurt himself.. And well he knew it would be useless to .ap-&#xD;
proach her now, for the words "on his way to town,' which ba-&#xD;
bel had heard, exposed at once the falsity of Clinton's assurance,&#xD;
that that evening he had seen her husband. iHe had et a de&#xD;

and familiar with intrigue although he was; for'now pehaps force&#xD;
intimidation and even blood-shed might be neoessaiy.-indeed he&#xD;
cared not what, so, that he gained his end..At length, feeling fe-&#xD;
verish from intense thought, and wondering .if he had not nearly&#xD;
reach   his ogings, he put down a window, and saw-could he&#xD;

UNEXPECTEDOCCURRENCES.&#xD;
&#xD;
believe hissenses?-trees, fences, and now an open country ! He&#xD;
rubbed his eyes, thinking, the darkness may have deceived him,&#xD;
but true enough there they were in the country, and traveling at a&#xD;
rapid rate. He had ,been too busy with his thoughtV, to notice&#xD;
where they had, been going; but a greater surprise was yet in&#xD;
store for him.&#xD;
The girl, Caroline, was sitting in another corner of the coach,&#xD;
perfectly silent and immovable, though she waslistening intently,&#xD;
and had full knowledge of what was going forwards But not hear-&#xD;
ing Clinton even move, a cold fear at length seized her, that favor-&#xD;
ed by the darkness, he had jumped from the carriage and escaped. ,&#xD;
Escaped? Yes, that would have been the word, for on the outside&#xD;
were a constable and his  two deputies, one upon the box, with the&#xD;
coachman, pleasantly employed in holding a pistolto that individ-&#xD;
ual's head; and the other two behind.&#xD;
The opening of the window relieved Caroline's fears and startled&#xD;
1"  the officers.&#xD;
"Bill!" roared Clinton from the inside, to his accomplice on the&#xD;
box, little dreaming that "Bill" was under surveillance, with a&#xD;
pistol at his head;, "where the devil are you driving to ? Stop!"&#xD;
"Oh, don't trouble yourself," said a gruff voice near him, "just&#xD;
let 'Bill' alone, if you mean your pal, for he's driving just as I or-&#xD;
dered."&#xD;
"You!" exclaimed Clinton, thrusting his head through the win-&#xD;
-dow. "And who are you ?"&#xD;
"Just keep yourhead in, will you ? said the voice, "or I'll hit&#xD;
it with my club."&#xD;
"I insist upon an explanation!" exclaimed the entrapped villain,&#xD;
with a great show of fury.&#xD;
"Well," said the voice, "if you want one partickler bad, why,&#xD;
the long and the short of the matter is this : We've come up from&#xD;
New York with three warrants agin you--one for forgery, one for&#xD;
counterfeiting, and what's worst for you, there's one for murder.&#xD;
There, keep your head in!-so you see-"&#xD;
"Stop, I say," roared Clinton, "this is an outrage,.an unparalel-&#xD;

"That's all my eye," interrupted the possessor of 'the voice "and&#xD;

We got the.information we Wanfed from an unexpected quarter, and&#xD;
finally we caught you all snug setting in this coach, and so we're&#xD;
going to give you the privilege-of a ride home for trial in your own&#xD;
vehicle. Ha, ha, ha !" and the officer being in a good humor with&#xD;
the prisoner for allowing himself to be ensnared so -easily, laughed&#xD;
very heartily at his expense.&#xD;
"But I say," continued he, after listening'for a while to Clin-&#xD;
ton's curses and vituperation "there isn't the least bit of use going&#xD;
on in that there way, for I tell you you're known, so just hush up.&#xD;
The long' and the short of the matter is that, if you don't I'll&#xD;

(as fai as the uncertain'light would allow) to guarding against any&#xD;
attempt to escape, should one be made, from his side of the vehicle.&#xD;

CHAPTER THE EIGHTH.&#xD;
CAROLINE.&#xD;
It was perhaps three o'clock in the morning. The young moon&#xD;
having been playing at hide and seek behind the clouds the whole&#xD;
night, began to feel weary after its exertions, and so sneaked oft&#xD;
to bed without being missed in the least, And then a few 'very&#xD;
uncertain stars popped out at intervals, and made desperate efforts&#xD;
to have a shine of it, but with indifferent success.&#xD;
And pretty Caroline having had a deal of sport thinking over&#xD;
her late confederate's trifling mishap, began to feel a surfeit of it,&#xD;
and- finally 'inclined more to colloquial enjoyment, But Clinton,&#xD;
strange to say, was'rude enough to tell her to mind her own bu-&#xD;
siness at the very first onset... Now the pretty Caroline was a la-&#xD;

as far as appearance went (no further) good. Therefore the read-&#xD;
er must not be surprised at her taking the soi-disant gentleman's&#xD;
rebuff in the light of a positive affront, which she did, for her eyes&#xD;
entertained an expression perfectly aboriginalish, (that-is to say,&#xD;
savage,) and darted all-kinds of lightning at him through the dark-&#xD;
ness..&#xD;
"Had I done so once," she said,"it would be better for me now,&#xD;
not that I look upon my degradation in any other light than that as&#xD;
you were the cause of it, to you I look for ultimate redress, and I&#xD;
will have it."&#xD;
"Pshaw," muttered Clinton, "no romance now, it's no time&#xD;
for it."&#xD;
"I was only fifteen," continued she, "when you carried me off&#xD;
from home. Well, I loved you, and that was 'my excuse. You&#xD;
took me to a strange city, vherp you said I should realize all my&#xD;
childhood's joyous dreams, but by the time the second Week had&#xD;
passed, all-'I realized was your abuse, and when the third week&#xD;
ended, you disappeared, no one could tell whither. For another&#xD;
week I watched and wept, thinking some misfortune had happened&#xD;
to you, but at last my eyes were opened to' the truth, and then,&#xD;
having no means--well, I need not mince the matter-I was oblig-&#xD;
ed to become criminal again, or perish in the street."&#xD;
"Oh, curse your reminiscences," grumbled the prisoner, "I&#xD;
have something else to think of now:&#xD;
"A year passed away," continued Caroline, without. appearing&#xD;
to notice what he said, "and I went to New York, where I met&#xD;
you again. You were pleased to see me, because I could now be&#xD;
useful to you, and fool-like, I was pleased to see you. Well, every&#xD;
day you plunged,,ie deeper into the abyss of crime, and I went&#xD;
blindly on, for I loved you still most fondly; and so, soul as well as&#xD;
body, I became yours. At length the police made a descent upon&#xD;
the gang you were connected with; surprising them at work with&#xD;
the bad nioney all about them, and' among themall, bat you and Bill&#xD;
escaped. We nianage&amp;amp;-you and I-kto maintain an appearance of&#xD;

sufficient to maintain _us, as you said, comfortably together in an-&#xD;

"Curse your tongue," interrupted the villain savagely ; "would&#xD;

The girl felt her passioiiate blood mounting up quickly, but out-&#xD;
wardly she betrayed,not the least emotion.&#xD;
"The deed accomplished," she continued, "you told me that it&#xD;
was better thatyou left awhile, until the excitement had blown&#xD;
over, and-to remain myself, in order that suspicion might not rest&#xD;
upon your head. I acquiesced readily,.and lived scantily and spar-&#xD;

you did not return, and I soon became utterly destitute. I obtained&#xD;

The girl smiled in'her'strange way, and said, 'Try it! I, too,&#xD;
armed.o But hear mie out. Imet-a friend, and learned that on the&#xD;
strength of 'forged letters of credit and introduction, purporting to&#xD;
be from large foreign houses, you were cutting quite a figure here,&#xD;
and had readily obtained entree to the best society. This made me&#xD;
think it would not be long before my services might be useful; and&#xD;
I was right in my conjecture, for that next night you'sought me&#xD;
out, and after promising me never more to leave me, proposed to&#xD;
me to'enter Mrs. Merton's service, as.her maid. You even told&#xD;
me your plans, particularly those regarding my own welfare, but&#xD;
I was not deceived. However, I consented to do as you desired,&#xD;
but I never, for a moment, had the least intent that you should bo&#xD;
sitcoessfnl. 'No, heaven forbid l I wished to see you near your&#xD;
full triumph, and, then to dash you, without a moment's warning,&#xD;
from the pinnacle of joy down to the darkest depths of misery. It&#xD;
was through me you became a prisoner, and it shall be through me,&#xD;
as state's evidence, that you will be condemned I"&#xD;
'The villain was appalled. "You will become State's Evidence,&#xD;
in fact?" he asked in a husky threatening tone.&#xD;
"Yes-and will pursue you to the gallows!"&#xD;
But in a second-before those outside knew aught of what was&#xD;
going on-he dashed open the carriage door, and, with one foot&#xD;
upon the step, he leveled a pistol towards the corner where she sat,&#xD;
and fired. The ball struck her, but collecting all her strength for&#xD;
a last effort, with a fierce cry, she sprang for the door and grasped&#xD;
him ere he could lea'ethe-steps.=The horses terrified by the sudden&#xD;
din, plunged so furiously, that the three officers as well for the&#xD;
safety of their own persons as for the re-capture of the prisoner,&#xD;
jumped hastily off and left Bill at liberty; a fact which he was not&#xD;
slow to notice, for he gave his panting horses the lash and soon&#xD;
left the constables far behind him.&#xD;
And in this mad way he dashed along (for he had 'been-a prisoner&#xD;
too) until it became'quite evident that unless the horsds had some&#xD;
rest, they woulddrop u pon the road ; so he reined them in. The&#xD;
darkness was now more 'intense than ever, 'for' it wanted but a few&#xD;

PUNISHMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
TIMOTHY TUGG MUTTON.&#xD;
Bill's ear--the My of an infant--very evidently quite near him.&#xD;
Bill descended .from his seat, and after groping about awhile,&#xD;
found, lying comfortably wrapped up, beneath a seat, poor Isabel's&#xD;
child ! A potent sleeping draught which Caroline had administer..-&#xD;
ed, had kept it quiet all this time, and amid the many horrors of&#xD;
the:night, the poor, infant had beenforgotten. Bill tookit up in his&#xD;
arms, and muttering something about a "kind of property he&#xD;
wouldn't have no use for," he carried it to the road-side, laid it&#xD;
down upon the grass, then jumped upon his box again, and drove&#xD;
slowly on.. But no one pursued him-he was free as air ! t&#xD;
Meanwhile, the constables were having a comfortable time&#xD;
of it.&#xD;
The prisoner made no effort to escape after the carriage dashed&#xD;
away, for the sudden bound which Caroline had made upon him,&#xD;
causedhis foot to slip and falling partially beneath the vehicle, the&#xD;
wheels passed over his right leg and crushed-it dreadfully. And&#xD;
Caroline-fell out into the centre of the road, where she was now&#xD;
lying, bleeding profusely from a ghastly wound in her bosom, un.&#xD;
conscious and sinking rapidly.&#xD;
CHAPTER THE NINTH.&#xD;
PUNISHMENTT.&#xD;
The constables ascertained these facts upon lighting a small dark&#xD;
lantern, and it was very clear that they. were not a little puzzled&#xD;
how to act,,which was natural enough under the. circumstances.&#xD;
"What's, to be done, Dinghy ?" asked oneof the deputies of his&#xD;
superior,&#xD;
"Well," answered.Dingby, "the long  ida ieshort of the mat-&#xD;
ter is, that it's a mighty bad business and no mistake ."&#xD;
&#xD;
And the deputies One and Two silently concurred.&#xD;
"There's no chance of finding assistance either," observed Num-&#xD;
ber One, "before daylight."&#xD;
''Have either of you any lint about you?" asked Dingby.&#xD;
"I hava little," answered Number Two.&#xD;
"Well, then," said Dingby, "I'll do what I can for.the girl first,&#xD;
for the long and the short of the matter is this : she'll die in ten&#xD;
minutes, if this bleeding ain't stopped ; though for that matter," he&#xD;
continued in a gloomier tone, "I'm afraid it's too late now."&#xD;
However, Dingby gave his handkerchief to*one of the others; to&#xD;
be converted into bandages, and as he raised Caroline slightly from&#xD;
the ground,she uttered a low~moan which told of such fearful agony,&#xD;
that it was sickening to hear. But in a few minutes the impromptu&#xD;
surgeon contrived to stop the flow of blood and to dress the wound,&#xD;
in a rude way, after which, he gave it as his opinion that she&#xD;
would last till day-light, anyway-if she was  lucky !&#xD;
And meanwhile, the villain, Clinton, remained prostrate where&#xD;
he had at first fallen, and the tortures he experienced were terri-&#xD;
bly acute.&#xD;
But he was comparatively unnoticed, for the officers knew that&#xD;
his hurts--.though of a shocking nature, precluding his making any&#xD;
effort to escape-.were yet by no means dangerous. So they cen-&#xD;
tered all their cares. upon the more deserving, but still insensible&#xD;
and apparently rapidly declining girl.&#xD;
His inglorious defeat and the almost certain prospect of an igno-&#xD;
minious death weighed heavily upon Clinton's mind. Now, that by&#xD;
an accursed chance, he had failed in the effort to escape, if Caro-&#xD;
line's wound should turn out mortal, so great would be the combi-&#xD;
nation of crimes against him, that he felt there was not a judge&#xD;
and jury in the land but would condemn him.' If she survived it,&#xD;
she would still be the instrument of his destruction, for the evi-&#xD;
dence she could give, familiar as she was with his, whole career,&#xD;
would be equally as damning. Oh, the agony of mind this harden-&#xD;
ed villain suffered, as these thoughts crashed through his brain.&#xD;
He would have changed conditions with sthe most abject wretch&#xD;
living or dead, that ever in freedom breathed God's air. And as&#xD;

he lay there in the darkness, visions of the kind:parents his vi-&#xD;
cious conduct sent broken-hearted to the tomb, seemed to him to&#xD;
be flitting somewhere near him, although he could not. see them,&#xD;
and he felt thatthey would keep ever near, whether with good or&#xD;
bad intent, until his own dark race was ended. ,And then he fan-&#xD;
cied heiaw the black clouds draw from the horizon, and a faint&#xD;
light overspread its which rolled on towards hini. getting brighter&#xD;
as it came, until it seemed one sheet of living flame&#xD;
Andysuddenly, with aloud report, the flames burstopen and&#xD;
disclosed-the bleeding phantoms of Caroline and his Jirst victims&#xD;
which quickly changed to two' colosean figures that pointedat and&#xD;
threatened himd, And, then: he felt a ponderous hand upon his&#xD;
throat, hot, red-hot, apparently, and he attempted to'spring up a'nd&#xD;
shake it off, but the crushed condition of his leg rendered the ef-&#xD;
fort vain, and with a wild !howl of pain and terror he. fell back&#xD;
again upon the road,&#xD;
At length, to the great joy of Dingby and his subordinates, the&#xD;
day began to break. We shall not attempt to describe the style .rof&#xD;
its breaking, (having due regard for the patience of our readers.,)&#xD;
but shall content ourselves with the sihnple assertion that to the&#xD;
great' joy of Dingby and his associates, the day began to break.&#xD;
And the worthy Dingby snuffed the fresh-breeze of;the morning'&#xD;
with a sense of satisfaction particularly lively, and with decided&#xD;
emphasis, he expressed it as 'his solemn conviction, that, "the long&#xD;
and the short of the matter was that he had' never passed a more&#xD;
uncomfortable night'in all his born,days." And the deputies, each&#xD;
making Dinghy's words applicable 'to his own particular. case, co-&#xD;
incided with him unanimously.        '&#xD;
Day having broken, all, that was necessary was to disover some&#xD;
house in-which the sufferers could have temporpry.refuge and&#xD;
have medical aid ,secured them, and in a turn of .the road, and&#xD;
close at hand, such a refuge was discovered by -one of the men-&#xD;
which one, the author was never able to learn.. And the people of&#xD;
the house did everything in their power to alleviate the.condition&#xD;
of the wounded, (not' the less readily for being made acquainted&#xD;
who they were), ajnd also contributed not, a little towards the al-&#xD;
&#xD;
leviation--(by virtue of some good Monongahela) of the condition&#xD;
of the unirjured parties.&#xD;
A deal of delay occurred before a physician arrived, which&#xD;
caused Dingby to swear considerably and to make innumerable al-&#xD;
lusions to the -long and the short of the matter. But he did arrive&#xD;
finally, andhe soon put the Commander-in-Chief of. the guards in&#xD;
a good humor again, by asserting that with care and attention the&#xD;
young woman would undoubtedly recover. -For Dingby concerned&#xD;
himself very little about Clinton's state, inasmuch as he (Dingby)&#xD;
'had settled it all up in his own mind, that as he (Clinton) was&#xD;
bound to be hung at any rate, it was merely necessary to patch&#xD;
him up sufficiently to keep life in him till such time as the law&#xD;
saw fit to make him undergo the hanging operation. Dingby's de-&#xD;
light, however, was of short duration, for upon his casually remark-&#xD;
ing that by the -following day he would have a comfortable con-&#xD;
veyance ready to go forward with his charges, .the physician sur-&#xD;
prised him with 'the information that it would be certain death to&#xD;
the girl, and a serious impediment t the man's recovery, were&#xD;
either to be removed within two weeks. From this decision he&#xD;
could not appeal, so he called numbers One and Two into council&#xD;
and expressed to them that he had come to the conclusion, "as they&#xD;
couldn't go away, why, he supposed-they'd have to stop, and that&#xD;
was the long and'the short of the matter."&#xD;
*    *     And Isabel-poor Isabel! The alluring joy-sweets&#xD;
in the conservatory of life had no longer charms for her, but were&#xD;
tasteless and bitter all. ''And the opening buds of Expectation, the&#xD;
bright flowers of Hope and the white rose of Peace, touched by the&#xD;
cold blast of misery, had drooped sadly down and died. The bright-&#xD;
ness had gone out from her eyes, the splendors of her career had&#xD;
faded for all time, and she was like a beautiful star falling from the&#xD;
lirmament,'and lost in the immensity of space.&#xD;
Did she regret her husband? YEs! 'For now that the last and fa-&#xD;
tal blow to her vanity and pride was given, the worldliness of her&#xD;
nature passed away, and allthat was 'good and noble in it rose once&#xD;
more 'to the surface. Her husband she regretted as one would re-&#xD;
gret a good man-a former 'friend,:whom we had greatly wronged&#xD;

manner-the thought. was naddening. She wept incessantly and&#xD;
would not be consoled. Parties were sent; out to search, and the&#xD;
findei of the little'one was promised 'an:unlimited reward. But as&#xD;
day after day passed away, without tidi gs teing brought, the mnis-&#xD;
erable mother fancied it was dead-murdered, perhaps--and left&#xD;
unburied in some lonely spot, where -her-messengers could never&#xD;
find it. And thisthought drove her almost frantic, and she refus&#xD;
ed all sustenance, until nature's cravings forced her to partake of&#xD;
food. Somethnes she would pray to be allowed to die, so that she&#xD;
might rejoin her husband and her little one in that bright realm&#xD;
where sorrow is never known;;but the,(moral sins she had commit-&#xD;
ted.on this earth,it, was idecreed;f should first be obliterated by&#xD;
years of tearfdl petnifnce,&#xD;
The guilty step she contemplated taking was never noised about.&#xD;
it was said, only, that on that fatal eight, , she had been at a friend's,&#xD;
'and returning late, she.met the men viho bore her husband's body,&#xD;
at the door, and at the sAie moment her-maid and child had disap-&#xD;

*  *  Mr. Dingby's extraordinary exertions for the benefit&#xD;
of the public morals, were destimed to receive a merited reward-&#xD;
by which we mean that he finally arrived safely in New York with&#xD;
his still helpless charges, and pocketed the good round sum that&#xD;
had been offered for Clinton's capture.&#xD;
The ruffian, after a hearing, was lodged in jail, to take his trial&#xD;
during the approaching term of the Criminal Court, but Caroline&#xD;
was nolongerian object of his fears. , Miserable girl! the excite-&#xD;
inent she had undergone-amounting almost, to frenzy,-added to&#xD;
the agony her wound created, found no re-action .with returning&#xD;
health. The light of reason had faded from her eyes, her mind&#xD;
was a complete blank, so from the prison hospital they conveyed&#xD;
her to the Asylum for the Insane, and left her there.&#xD;
A month afterwards a city paper contained the following item:&#xD;
"The notorious scoundrel Edmund Clinton, alias John Brently,&#xD;
received sentence yesterday. Owing to the lunacy of the unfor-&#xD;
tunate girl, Caroline Moore, one of his. victims, the charge of the&#xD;
murder of Mr. Simands, three years ago, could not be sustained,&#xD;
as she was the only winess. Theproofs against him, however, on&#xD;
the charges of forgery, counterfeiting and, obtaining money under&#xD;
false pretences, weresufficiently strong to warrant Judge Ward in&#xD;
sentencing him to hard labor in the Sing Sing Penitentiary for the&#xD;
term of ten years and six months."&#xD;
It was but a short time before this, reader, that the infantile&#xD;
Mutton was found close by John Perkins' garden gate.' With the&#xD;
modest hope that this fact ,.will be duly understood in all respects,&#xD;
we beg permission to take Mutton by the hand once more, and get&#xD;
him into 'every possible-di iculty, 'in 'such cases and under such&#xD;

THE HOMELESS ORPHAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER: THE TENTH.&#xD;
THEf' HOMELESS ORPHAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
Beneath a.tree by a' road-side sat poor Tim, Looking weary and&#xD;
sadr for twilight had spread around and he was without , shelter&#xD;
ora home. All day long he had wandered on, now running fast,&#xD;
when.he came'"to a straight road, for fear he might be seen and&#xD;
overtaken, and forced back again to be beaten by the woman who&#xD;
said his mother had god right'to leave him:at John Perkins' gar-&#xD;
den gate; now pausng in"sonIe unfrequented spot' to brush away&#xD;
atear, Ahd he wondered whether any other bof had run away&#xD;
before ashey had Adorieand if' so, whether 'it was ona wonan's ac-'&#xD;
count--a woman that ill-treated him  and whh etl hat woman&#xD;
Lo~ked                  im-a    w n 1erithat woman&#xD;
looked much like Mrs Nancy, or could talk as much. And at this&#xD;
hewould feel somewhat startled, and would look around him fear-&#xD;
fully as though he' expected Ito find a Mrs. Naiy standing near&#xD;
him, stickein hand, ut;seeing no ope he would'become re-assured&#xD;
again, and ivlk on further. :And after such' small alarms, Tim&#xD;
imagined that he ought: to feel very happy, now that he was his&#xD;
own master and could go just where he pleased and have no one to&#xD;
interfere with him, but-there was only one'slight-drawback in the ,&#xD;
thing, which was that.in-spite ofthis enjoying the largest liberty,&#xD;
a little substantial;,food'was. absolutely necessary ,for the promotion&#xD;
of h personal comforts.' Under all the{'circumstances, .however,&#xD;
Tim thought a reblIous stomach, that had a propensity to pro-&#xD;
voke eternal commotions and serious disaffedtionsi should be'ri-&#xD;
gorously governed until such dime' as he might alleviate its dis-&#xD;
tresses:withoutjeopardising the entire body corporate.&#xD;
This severe system Tim adhered to throughout the day, not even&#xD;
allowing himselfto g o near a farmhouse or a tod-side inn to ask&#xD;
for acip of, water, lest his, newly-ac qiied liilerty should become&#xD;
endangered, and he be again obliged to submit to the yoke of des-&#xD;
potism. But when the sun went down, and strong symptoms of&#xD;
an approaching suspensidn of daylight were Manifest, Tim sat&#xD;
down beneath a tree upon the road-side, feeling very weary and&#xD;
&#xD;
sad. And then it suddenly occurred to -him that a grove of trees&#xD;
close by, might be an orchard, that an orchard at this season con-&#xD;
tained fruit, that fruit was palatable, and that anything that was&#xD;
palatably would do te make a meal of. So he hastened with in-&#xD;
creased appetite to the grove of promise, and, mouting a tree that&#xD;
seemed peculiarly inviting, began first to till his interior youth, and&#xD;
next his hat. And then he suddenly labored under the conviction&#xD;
that some body had a better right and title to this orchard than he&#xD;
had, and that this somebody might, should he catch him, not only&#xD;
object to his proceedings, but lay violent hands upon him. So Tim&#xD;
prepared to descend at once, and the purloined fruit, catching,&#xD;
doubtless, the same spirit (tho' probably through a spirit of emiu-&#xD;
lation), took the opportunity of tilting over our hero's hat and des-&#xD;
cending considerably in advance of him.&#xD;
"Aha I" said somebody beneath, "stealing apples, eh? Come&#xD;
down here till I whip you."&#xD;
But, generous as this invitation was, Tim actually hesitated to&#xD;
accept it !&#xD;
"Come now," resumed the obliging individual, be in a hurry,&#xD;
will you, for I'm going to supper, and can't wait."&#xD;
"Please sir," said Tim in a deprecating tone, "I haven't eaten&#xD;
many, and you may have the others, if you'll be so good as to pick&#xD;
'em up, and if you'll just let me go this once, I'll never do it again,&#xD;
indeed I won't.  Please sir, I was so hungry I couldn't help it."&#xD;
"'Why didn't you go home then," asked the man, "and get some-&#xD;
thing to eat?"&#xD;
"Because I hadn't any home to go to, sir," answered Tim. "At&#xD;
least, sir, I had one once, but I-please, sir, don't be angry at me."&#xD;
"Well, conie down till I see you," said the man. "Don't, be&#xD;
afraid I'll eat you, for I won't, you may be sure "&#xD;
"But you'll beat me," whimpered Tim. "Please don't beat me&#xD;
-she did that, and I couldn't stand it,:;so-"&#xD;
"O"hl' ejaculated the man," you've run away, have you? Aha l&#xD;
Well, I won't hurt you. Come down now, or I set the dog at you,"&#xD;
Terrific ideal Our hero didn't pause to argue as to-whether the&#xD;
dog in question could climb trees or not, (being quite uncertain as&#xD;

to the°calibre, of dogs existing beyond the immediate vicinity of&#xD;
Blinkville,) sQ he caine down quickly. The man looked at him, as&#xD;
Tim thought,very suspiciously, though as it was getting rather&#xD;
dark, Tim might have been mistaken,&#xD;
What might your name be?" askedthe man.&#xD;
"Why, sir," answered our youth, "the boys at old Scribbleses&#xD;
school called me Scragg of Mutton; but I whipped some of them&#xD;
.for it; and then they didn't do it any more, because they knew&#xD;
Charley and me would let 7emn have it, for it wasn't my name, nor&#xD;
Charley's neither.&#xD;
And although this reply was exceedingly lucid, considering that&#xD;
the man merely.asked what his name might be, yet that individual,&#xD;
instead of being satisfied, actually put the question the second'&#xD;
time, which caused Tim to feel a horrible suspicion that he was a,&#xD;
a spy of Mrs. Nancy's, and that'his object was to entrap and take&#xD;
him back.--But he told him his name at last, and then the man (so&#xD;
Tim thought) pretended he didn't believe him, saying that he&#xD;
couldn't be made a fool of that way, by a boy, and that he'd find&#xD;
out and so forth.Arid the man furthermore told him to come along&#xD;
to the house, and that, if he was honest, he- would give him a good&#xD;
home in place of the one he left, and more to the same purpose.&#xD;
But Ting was now 'norally certain that the questioner was a spy&#xD;
of'Mrs. Nancy's, and that he only wanted to get him n the house&#xD;
in order that he might; be more sure of him. So as soon as the&#xD;
man started towards the house spoken of, our hero slipped by him&#xD;
and rah in. the opposite direction, as fast as his legs could carry&#xD;
him.--Little did heheed, the supposed spy's cries of "stop," "hold&#xD;
on," etc., He had no idea of being taken back to' Blinkville, and&#xD;
after getting a beating himself, hear John Perkins abused because&#xD;
he dared to take the.lpart of his protege. No ! Tim had a small bo-'&#xD;
dy, but it contained a very large sized heart, so he preferred de-&#xD;
clining an invitation that might have such -disagreeable results.&#xD;
Aid he ranon rapidly, thinking he was followed-occasionally&#xD;
falling upon.the uneven ground, and at such times fairly screaming&#xD;
withafright lesthis imaginary pursuer should overtake him ere he&#xD;
&#xD;
could rise, until'at last feeling too much exhausted to run further,&#xD;
he took a stand, resolved to perish or retain his freedom.&#xD;
The moon was shining brightly ; all was quiet, and not a living&#xD;
creature was to be seen. Then Tim took hearty and 'walked on&#xD;
slowly till he came to a field of new-made hay, the Very scent of&#xD;
which made him feel sleepy, So he scraped a lot. of the hay to-&#xD;
gether to form a bed,-and gathered some more to serve for cover-&#xD;
ing, and then. laid down, and endeavored to feeLbrave enough to&#xD;
sleep.&#xD;
A tree stood by the road side--a great melancholy old tree--that&#xD;
had taken root, doubtless, centuries before : in times when the&#xD;
white man's foot had not yet pressed the soil, when it was unex-&#xD;
plored, and totally unknown, except to the Great Spirit and his red&#xD;
children.-Many years after, when the pale face left his home&#xD;
over the deep waters, and was encroaching more and more upon the&#xD;
red man's hunting ground, a legend took date beneath this same old&#xD;
tree-a legend of ayoung girl who fell ,in love with a young cap-&#xD;
tive of her tribe, and liberated him.-And she fled with him to the&#xD;
white settlements, deserting her own people for their enemies; and&#xD;
the warriors of her tribe were incensed against her, and pur'sued&#xD;
them, thirsting for revenge. And it was, beneath this tree they&#xD;
overtook them.in the night, when the young pale face was sleeping,&#xD;
and the maiden was watching over him---both unconscious of their&#xD;
danger., And- the fierce warriors seized their young enemy and&#xD;
bound him to a tree, and would have murdered hin betord her eyes,&#xD;
had she not' sprung between, and received the fatal shift in her own&#xD;
loving bosom. And there they laid her in the earth, bnt he was&#xD;
reserved for torture unto death in the presence of all the warriors&#xD;
and women of the tribe.&#xD;
The tree was vigorous in those days, lofty and green, and for a&#xD;
centuryimore it shaded the maiden's grave, but now it was leafless&#xD;
and -decayed, and Stood there like an ancient patriarch that had&#xD;
outlived the associates of youth and all his kindred.--And when&#xD;
Tim looked;'upon this tree, and;heard the night winds mnoaniiig&#xD;
through it's branches; he imagined it 'looked like a hired phantom,&#xD;
with an hundred arms, and covered"uphis head through fear. Yet&#xD;

&#xD;
ithad a kind of fascination for him, he knew not why, with its&#xD;
bare, cheerless look, andthe sad mournful voice the .winds had lent&#xD;
it, so he looked at it again and fancied that the Voice among= the&#xD;
branches became gradually more sorrowful and  plaintive, and he'&#xD;
finally became infected by it, and felt desolate and sick at heart.&#xD;
But he was very weary, and soon, in spite of the' fascination of the&#xD;
old tree arid the Voice among its branches, he fell fast asleep, and&#xD;
it was not until next morning, that some one shaking him with&#xD;
great energy, and speaking in tones he thought he knew, caused&#xD;
him to awake.&#xD;
CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH.&#xD;
ThE CAVESE.&#xD;
"Come,, ain't you going to wake up to-day?" queried grouh-&#xD;
looking young man, dressed in a pepper-and-salt suit, with a wag-&#xD;
oner's' frock over it, as he gave Tim another shaking, "come now,&#xD;
get up." It was the same individual who, on the previous even-&#xD;
ing, so strongly urged upon our. hero the necessity of getting&#xD;
down." And Tim opened his eyes with considerable surprise at&#xD;
finding himself lying in a hay field, by a road-side, a wagon and&#xD;
team standing near, and a strange man bending' over him; and for a&#xD;
moment, he had a very indistinct perception of where he was, or of&#xD;
what had happened. However, upon his being again addressed by&#xD;
the rough-looking young man, in the pepper-and-salt .suit and&#xD;
wagoner's frock, he suddenly recollected his danger, and 'would&#xD;
have run away again had not his persecutor laid firm hold of him.&#xD;
"Why, what's the matter with the;youngster ?" exclaimed the&#xD;
Wagoner. "I never see such capers cut afore in all my dagse You&#xD;
hain't been stealin' nothin' have you?"&#xD;

"Oh, no, sir, indeed I haven't," cried Tim, "only the apples,&#xD;
and I was so hungry, because I'd 'nothing to 'eat all day.-But&#xD;
please don't make me go back gain "&#xD;
"Where do you live ??' asked the man-}-""wvith your father and&#xD;
mother'?"&#xD;
"Oh, sir," answered Tim, with an involuntary sob, "I have no&#xD;
father or mother, and no friends except John Perkins, who was&#xD;
raising ie ; but Nancy used to want him to send'me .off, for she&#xD;
didn't seem to like me, so at last- I ran away that there might be&#xD;
quiet."&#xD;
"ou're sure y ou're tellingme thetruth?" asked the man more&#xD;
kindly.&#xD;
"Indeed I am, si, replied Tim, "for John Perkins scolded me&#xD;
once, when I told him a story, and made me feel ashamed of it, and&#xD;
I promised him I would never be so bad again, and I loved him, so&#xD;
I couldn't do it now, sir, indeed I-couldn't.&#xD;
"I believe you," said'the Wagoner. And he went on to tell Tim&#xD;
that he was going to New York with his wagon to purchase goods&#xD;
for a store.on the farm owned by his father (whose orchard Tim&#xD;
had been rifling,) that he would take Tim along if he wished to go,&#xD;
and if they got along properly together on the trip, he would keep&#xD;
him with him oiW the farm after they came back;, to which our hero&#xD;
joyfully replied, (he had given up the. spy idea by this time) .that&#xD;
he couldn't possibly ask anything better, unless it was something&#xD;
to eat. Upon which the young man smiled and told Tim to ju1pp&#xD;
into the wagon, and take some cold meat and bread and cheese he&#xD;
would find there, and to eat away as much as -he pleased. He then&#xD;
proceeded to start his team, and after a good deal of whip-cracking&#xD;
and geeing and hawing, got them fairly moving on their way.&#xD;
But we will not trouble our readers with a detailed account of&#xD;
their stoping an hour after at a miller's, emptying the wagon there&#xD;
of the sacks it had contained, or of the Wagoner's receiving a sum&#xD;
of money in exchange, as these facts are comparatively of little im-&#xD;
port.  We need merely say, that towards evening on. the second&#xD;
day they were overtaken by two men on horseback, 'who imine-&#xD;
diately entered into conversation with Tim's friend, the Wagoner.&#xD;

'They were both tolerably well dressed,,and one of them had an air&#xD;
of-good breeding, but the expression of his countenance was- of a&#xD;
decidedly disagreeable character. The. anau with an air of good&#xD;
breeding was tall- and wellbuilt, his features were regular and&#xD;
would have been handsome, had it not been for the settled scowl&#xD;
which markedthmi. His eyes were large, dark and piercing, but&#xD;
at times werealmost concealed by the heavy brows. His forehead&#xD;
was expansive but -deeply wrinkled, and an ugly scowl upon his,&#xD;
right'tenple,"by no means -added to his appearance. His com-&#xD;
plexion was pale almost to ghastliness, and this effect was height-,&#xD;
eied by his long black hair, and heavy moustache.of the. same color.&#xD;
His age may have been 45. His companion was eight or ten years&#xD;
vounger, but his appearance was still moreunprepossessing.-His&#xD;
features were' coarse and-vulgar, his eyes grey and, very small, his&#xD;
nose crooked, his forehead low and narrow, his face red and bloat-&#xD;

ticularly of the decided:redness. ,In stature he was considerably&#xD;
shorter than the first, but he was evidently his equal in physical,&#xD;
strength.J&#xD;
'Pleasant weather we have had lately,"-said horseman the first&#xD;
addressing Tim's friend, the Wagoner,&#xD;
And the Wagoner answered "Yes," very shortly, for he didn't&#xD;
like the looks of leis questioner.&#xD;
"Favorable for your business," continued the stranger. You&#xD;
are on your way to the:city, I presume ?"&#xD;
"Yes,"-answered the:Wagoner.&#xD;
"Going to purcha 'goods, I suppose;.' see your wagon is emp-&#xD;
ty," and horseman 'the first exchanged a look with horseman the&#xD;
second, and then continued. I hope you'll- not he offended at my&#xD;
curiosity, for the tact is, I have been so long absent from this part&#xD;
of the country that Inaturally make more enquiries=than, perhaps,&#xD;
courtesy would sanction. But twelve years residence in&#xD;
that is to say&#xD;
Mong'the Nor-Wester Injins" prompted horseman the-second,&#xD;
speaking for the first time.&#xD;
"Eaoily,"  aid the first. 1 ' naturally hesitated at.meindoutoing&#xD;
&#xD;
the locality, inasmuch 'as we never saw the face of a white man;&#xD;
and for years were unaware of the latitude and longitude in which&#xD;
we were, being obliged to remain altogether among a wandering&#xD;
horde of savages."&#xD;
"Savages!" echoed the Wagoner; with some interest, "them's&#xD;
'injun' s of course?"&#xD;
."In course," said the red-headed individual, "Nor Westers,&#xD;
reg'lar five digiters, ken-crackers and ely fakers.'"&#xD;
"My friend here," observed the tall man, "will occasionally in-&#xD;
terlard his discourse with scraps of' Indian dialect, forgetting that&#xD;
in civilized communities, that language is quite unknown," and&#xD;
the speaker gave his friend a peculiar look,  "Of course, it is&#xD;
quite natural, when we'take into-consideration the fact of his hav-&#xD;
ing mingled a great deal with the savages. ,Doubtless I should&#xD;
have become addicted to similar habits, had I not, during the whole&#xD;
term of my captivity, remembered that some day I might be en-&#xD;
abled to return to society, and therefore avoided all communication&#xD;
with those around me."&#xD;
"And you couldn't get away ?" asked the Wagoner, becoming&#xD;
greatly interested.&#xD;
"It was out of question, my dear sir," replied ' the- tall man.&#xD;
"We were closely guarded night and day, compelled to perform&#xD;
the most degrading offices, but had we attempted to escape, we&#xD;
should'inevitably have been restaken, and of course treated more&#xD;
rigorously than ever." We should have been subjected to-t--to-"&#xD;
"Darbies and stretchers," suggested the person with the illum-&#xD;
inated cranium, thinking his friend at a loss for words.&#xD;

able to break you' of that odious habit of quoting the aboriginal&#xD;

may be misinterpreted, and your standing in society endangered&#xD;

indulge this propensity even when we are alotie  in order that you&#xD;
may sooner forget our late' misfortune, and particularly that you&#xD;
may more effectually guard against its recurrence. As I was re-&#xD;

lieve, my dear sir, that it consisted solely of-"&#xD;
Tead and water,'? muttered the short gentleman.&#xD;
"True," exclaimed the narrator, quickly, "Indian corn bread and&#xD;
water-nothing else."&#xD;
"You must have had lotspf adventures," thoughtfully observed&#xD;
the Wagoner.&#xD;
"Quite a history," asserted the tall man ; "indeed, I may say&#xD;
that we had an entire circulating library of them, and I should be&#xD;
delighted to recount some of the ,principal incidents, had I time to&#xD;
do soj but as it is growing dark, and as we design stopping for to-&#xD;
night at a tavern, a mile or so further on, we must now leave you.'&#xD;
"I reckon I shall;put up there, too," said the wagoner, "for al-&#xD;
though it can't be much further:to, town "&#xD;
"Eight miles, if I remember rightly," nterrupted the tall man.&#xD;
"Yes, about that, I believe," asserted the Wagoner-"still I&#xD;
don't trust traveling after dark with money about me."&#xD;
"And you are quite right," said the tall man approvingly, "but&#xD;
adieu for the present, and if you stop at the tavern in question, I&#xD;
shall be happy to renew our acquaintance.&#xD;
"Lord, how I should like to hear an Ingjn story,"' remarked the&#xD;
Wagoner to Tim. I'll get lnim to tell one, see if I don't.&#xD;
The late captives of the North Western Aborigines started on&#xD;
ahead, and the tallest turned to the shortest, and said, angrily--.&#xD;
"I tell you, Dick, either you must put some guard upon your&#xD;

plained-Dick., "I say you've had the nateral eddication of a born&#xD;
big wig, whereas I- never lamed nothin' 'cept what I picked up&#xD;
among the Pinters. And so, as to readin' and writin' and all that&#xD;
gammon, why it's all~-it's all in my winkers, dy'e see?"&#xD;
F'I must say, Dick," remarked the tall man, "that I cannot trace&#xD;
the slightest expression of knowledge either in the organs you&#xD;
mention, or anywhere else within the limits of your person. I wish&#xD;
to impress upon your mind, if possible, that it would be expedient&#xD;
for you tomaintain perfect silence, whenever it is practicable, un-&#xD;
less you can answer merely negatively, or-"&#xD;
Dick interrupted: "Now it's no use, Jack, agoin' over that e're&#xD;
again, for I don't know no more what you mean than a kiddy."&#xD;
"Damn it, man," exclaimed Jack, impatiently, "are you a coin.&#xD;
plots fool?'"-&#xD;
"Now, that's English," said Dick, delighted, and I'm fly. Why&#xD;
don't you always talk that away, when you want ine to know your&#xD;
meaning ? It's well enough when you're in company, to come the&#xD;
swell cove&#xD;
"Dick," interrupted the other, "I tell you, once for all, that you&#xD;
must keep your flash for the Crib in Cross street, for if I hear any&#xD;
more of it, we part company.--Do-you understand that?"&#xD;
"I believe I do, Jack," answered the short-man, meekly, and I'll&#xD;
do my best, so don't get mad about it."&#xD;
"Well then," said the other, "if a man asks you a question, say&#xD;
either yes or no, as the case may be, but if you're not spoken to,&#xD;
don't open your mouth. -JV'ow, do you know what I mean&#xD;
"In course I do, Jack," replied Richard, "and curse me if I&#xD;
don't keep a trying' to as long as I swaller grub."&#xD;
"Very good," said Jack. "I'll do the thinking and talking for&#xD;
both of us, and do you be satisfied with operating, for there you&#xD;
are as handy a fellow as I want to meet with. You noticed that&#xD;
boy with the countryman, didn't you'?',&#xD;

"You wonld know him again, would you lot?"&#xD;
Dick shook his head doubtfully.&#xD;
"WtlltDick," continued the tall man, "this boy bears a resem-&#xD;
blance to a mtan I once knew, amounting to identity. His only son&#xD;
was lost et avery early age, and is now supposed to be dead. At&#xD;
the father's death, the reversion of the property became .You&#xD;
understand me, don't you?"&#xD;
p            "No!", replied Dick.&#xD;
"Well then," said the other, "I must have this boy, and should&#xD;
it become necessary, we must   "&#xD;
Dick threw up his chin and drew his forefinger across his throat&#xD;
significantly. Jack smiled.&#xD;
"Dick," he said, "you'd be a perfect treasure if you'd only give&#xD;
up talking."&#xD;
And in this way they conversed upon Jack's plan (or rather&#xD;
Jack did, for Dick confined himself to monosyllables) until they&#xD;
halted at a large country inn which stood behind a large sign, upon&#xD;
which was painted' a remarkably large party-colored bear, together&#xD;
with an inscriptionsin singularly large letters, which was intended&#xD;
to convey the information to a traveling or rambling public, that&#xD;
here good entertainment for man and horse would be provided.-&#xD;
A handsome barouche, containing two ladies, an elderly gentle-&#xD;
man and a cachman, 'and drawn by a pair of bea:ttiful bays, was&#xD;
ubout starting off as  our late Captives came up. The landlord was&#xD;
standing by, obsequiously bowing adieux and expressing his hope&#xD;
that they would enjoy their ride and get home safely. To which&#xD;
one of the ladies, in, a very riehnielodious tone, (which caused the&#xD;
tall traveler to'statt with surprise) replied that she hoped so in-&#xD;
deed, and away they went.&#xD;
The keeper of-'the party-colored bear looked after them admir-&#xD;
ingly. "There goes two of the most handsomest women I ever&#xD;
saw," saidhe, "andfor 'kindness of heart and liberality, there ain't&#xD;
another in the country that can beat Mrs. Merton."-&#xD;
"Mrs: Merton!" exclaimed the tall man, "Mrs: Isabel Merton&#xD;
--is'she oe fofthose ladies!"&#xD;
"Certainly," replied the landlord quickly, "do- you happen 'to&#xD;
know her ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes-no--that is, knew.her formerly," replied the tall man;&#xD;
"does she reside in this neighborhood now?"&#xD;
"At the large house on the hill, about three miles by the road&#xD;
from here," answered the landlord. "She spends the most of her&#xD;
time there-but come in, sir,,come .in."&#xD;
"I thank you, landlord," replied Jack, "but as my friend and I&#xD;
have been all day on horseback and feel rather :cramped and stiff,&#xD;
we will take a 'short walk first. The moon shines brightly, and it&#xD;
will be pleasantf-Meanwhile prepare us a good supper, and let&#xD;
our horses be taken care of.. Come, Dick," he added in an under-&#xD;
tone to his friend, "follow ine."&#xD;
Jack struck into the scattering wood opposite the inn, and Dick&#xD;
followed him after the manner of a dog when whistled for by his&#xD;
master.&#xD;
"We can head them off .a mile below here," whigpered Jack,&#xD;
"by cutting thro the felds Come on, come on, there will be plenty&#xD;

She had the tiniest mouth,-and,-uch dewy coral Ups-lips that at&#xD;

which one day charmed her with their warbling, on the next, she&#xD;
would insist were much torqnoisy ; and as for garry"'bless us&#xD;

And she loved-him, too, but, concealed it very carefully from&#xD;
every one, and she led him such a miserable race whenever he&#xD;
came down into the country to visit her, that ncle Jacob (inas.-&#xD;
much as Harry was the only son of an old particular friend of his)&#xD;
was forced to take her to task about it occasionally. Upon which&#xD;
.Egeria would go off into a fit of pouting, and declare that it was&#xD;
really too bad that shecouldn't have her own way in any thing,&#xD;
and assert that she was very, very tired of living,ato say the least&#xD;
of it. And then Uncle Jacob would feel quite distressed and would&#xD;
kiss her fondly, and tell her -that he was going to town, and that if&#xD;
she wanted anything to let hin know it and.he would get it for&#xD;
her. Not that uncle Jacob had any;previous intention of going to&#xD;
town on that day, not by any 'neans; but it was a little cunning&#xD;
trick of his to restore the gopd humor of his spoiled darling-who&#xD;
could blame him for it,? . Then Egeria would be all smiles again,&#xD;
and mention: some trifle--a guitar string, or a new piano cover, or&#xD;
some drawing pencils- _ a being 411 that was requisite for her hap-&#xD;
piness. And then, without uare ado, Uncle Jacob would ride off&#xD;
to tpwn and make the purchases,.(which he could have sent a&#xD;
servant foroust as well) and after making the purchases he would&#xD;

him to move one step; not sle for sheloved him too well and hadk&#xD;
too much regard for hiscomfort for that.&#xD;
In truth, she was"an:innocent, gentle feature, whose;very faults&#xD;
were graces and she had' asigood heart at bottom as any one&#xD;
could wish."} Did -affictidn visit those she loved; she could be as&#xD;
devoted, as'self-serificing, as nobly disinterested, as watchful- and&#xD;
as eager tto assist" as the very best of us could' be. But she had&#xD;
never known the lightest care, ,nd she couldn't help being capri-&#xD;
cious in a harmless awfy-haw could she ?&#xD;
The third individual in the barouche was no 'less a personage&#xD;
than Uncle'Jacob. The snows of. fifty winters had neither left&#xD;
traces on his brow, nor chilled his heart, and there was Just as&#xD;
much benignity in his smile, and he felt as -pure delight in doing&#xD;
good, as though a care had never 'crossed him in his walk thro'&#xD;
life's' (to him) dark -valley. His first-born 'child had been stolen&#xD;
from hit as she.was budding into womanhood, and never could be&#xD;
found or heard of ; and his wife took it to heart so deeply that she&#xD;
pined slowly but surely away, and at last in giving birth to the se-&#xD;
cond girl, Egeria, like an expiring 'lamp, her spirit for a moment&#xD;
shed a bright ray around, and then went out. 'And oh, to him,&#xD;
how terrible was this second blow!-but he had duties to perform&#xD;
on earth and dared not bend beneath it. How-he performed those&#xD;
duties we can judge.' And next the affliction of his niece became&#xD;
his care, for he loved her' as a daughter, so he removed with her&#xD;
from a place so fraught'with tearful memories, and they- came to&#xD;
the sequestered spot where now they were residing. Uncle Ja-&#xD;
cob was not rich himself, but he had sufficient to give him an hum-&#xD;
ble independence, and that was all he asked for.&#xD;
There had been a fourth member of the party--not in the baroucner&#xD;
but prancing along on horseback by its side--this member was&#xD;
Harry Chester. Egeria, however, in one of 'her willful'moods, had&#xD;
commanded' him to ride home before them, acid to wait for' them at&#xD;
Ihe gate, and under pain of her seruas displeasure(ard 'possibly.&#xD;
banishment to"town)ot 'to show his face again-'tniil they 'should'&#xD;

&#xD;
and pitiless. So he galloped on ahead of them, and kept up a se-&#xD;
ries of confidential communications to every tree and fence he pas-&#xD;
sed, to the effect (for he was frightfully in love) that he was by&#xD;
far the most miserable dog that lived.&#xD;
And Egeria detained the others at the tavern,. (under pretext&#xD;
of requiring refreshments,) in order that Harry should get a fair&#xD;
start of them, though she afterwards felt that she wouldn't be at all&#xD;
angry if he should disobey her orders and wait for them a little way&#xD;
down the road. But he was nowhere in sight, and the wayward&#xD;
girl became as much annoyed through .her own order as Harry&#xD;
was. And then she thought he might, perhaps, ride on to town,&#xD;
or be attacked by somebody, or be thrown from his -horse and bad-&#xD;
ly hurt, or even killed, and so she became perfectly miserable.&#xD;
"But I don't care," she murmured impatiently "since he was so&#xD;
foolish as to mind me."&#xD;
"Who are you speaking of, Egy?" asked Uncle Jacob; and poor&#xD;
Egeria colored, to think how she had betrayed herself, and endea-&#xD;
vored to get up a careless-laugh to hide her confusion, but made a&#xD;
perfect failure of it. "Was it Harry?" continued the good old gen-&#xD;
tleman, with a quiet smile.-"Has your sin brought its own pun-&#xD;
ishment already? Oh, Egy, Egy !"&#xD;
"Now, pa, how can you tease me thus?' cried the spoiled beau-&#xD;
ty. "I'm sure it is enough to annoy me to think that he could be&#xD;
so regardless of my comfort-.-I mean our safety-as to leave us on&#xD;
a lonely road at night," but as Uncle Jacob only laughed at this&#xD;
argument, she ceased, and went to work with all her witchery and&#xD;
might, and had a quiet little pout of it.&#xD;
"Come, come, daughter,", said Uncle Jacob, affectionately, "why&#xD;
not make Harry happy by an acknowledgment of your love for&#xD;
him, for the idea of there being danger to apprehend on this road&#xD;
is only-"&#xD;
A loud scream from Egeria, and a faint cry from Isabel, caused&#xD;
Uncle Jacob to break off rather abruptly, and on looking around&#xD;
towards the coachman, he was not a little disconcerted at finding&#xD;
they were stopped in a very unceremonious way by ouir two ill-&#xD;
favored travelers, the. liberated' North-Western Captives.&#xD;

CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE' ROBBERY.&#xD;
When Jack 'and Dick returned to the party-colored Bear, they&#xD;
found Tim and his friend, the Wagoner, seated in the public room&#xD;
and quietly discussimg a palatable supper. So Jack, wishing to cul-&#xD;
tivate the acquaintance of persons he looked 'upon with oonsider-&#xD;
able -interest, ordered his and Dick's supper to be brought into the'&#xD;
same apartment.&#xD;
"We;got here ahead of you after all," observed the Wagoner.&#xD;
"Not sa,'"'asserted Jack  "'My friend and I, feeling cramped&#xD;
after our long ride, after putting up our horses, took {a walk&#xD;
through the wood-yonder, and finally we laid down to rest awhile,&#xD;
and without intending.it,'fell asleep."&#xD;
"I was all in a wonder where you'd got',to," observed the pro..&#xD;
prietor of the Bear, "and if it hadn't:been that you 'left your&#xD;
horses, I should have'thought that-you'd 'followed Mrs. Merton."&#xD;
At which Jack-glanced at'Dick, and Dick interpreted the glance&#xD;
thus: "Do you see now why I preferred following them on foot ?"&#xD;
and Dick thought Jack a man of more cleverness and forethought&#xD;
then he had previously met with during his entire professional&#xD;
career.,&#xD;
"Why," said .Jack,' "the fact' is, I was acquainted with M'rs.&#xD;
Merton's late husband, but she would scarcely recognize me now,&#xD;
&#xD;
for my appearance has been so changed for the worse, during my&#xD;
long captivity---"&#xD;
"Yes, among the Injuns," broke in the Wagoner.&#xD;
"The Sing tribe-Nor-westers-dye see,*pro npted Dick, for-&#xD;
getting his superior's injunction in regard to 'monosyllabique con-&#xD;
versation.,-&#xD;
"That in fact," continued.Jack, without heeding the interrup,&#xD;
tion, "inste d of following J should prefer avoiding her now.-&#xD;
Hardships and- suffering make sad havoc with a man's good looks."&#xD;
And Jack walked to the;other end of the room, as though these&#xD;
painful recollections wee too much for him to bear.&#xD;
"You've had a deal on them, 'then ?" enquired the landlord,&#xD;
(who was always on the look-out for information,) as he turned to&#xD;
Dick.&#xD;
"A reg'lar ken full," answered Dick, in a low tone, "just get&#xD;
him, a blown  em,&#xD;
"Get him a blowin' 'em!" exclaimed 'the keeper of the Bear.&#xD;
"What's that? Don't believe I've got it in the house. May be you&#xD;

"Whytaint no lush," replied Dick, surprised at the Proprietor's&#xD;
ignorance. "Get himto blow the fly--to peach- dy'e see ?" 3ut&#xD;
as the worthy host still seemed to be innocent of the knowledge of&#xD;
his meaning, Dick turned from him, and washed down his feelings&#xD;
of disgust with a glass of brandy.&#xD;
lack imagined that by this time his emotion had been palpable to&#xD;
the landlord and Wagoner, and he therefore threw a look of re-&#xD;
signation to fate' over his features, and returned to the table. And&#xD;
the Landlord and the Wagoner coincided in the opinion that he was&#xD;
a very ill-used man.&#xD;
"How long were you captivated among the Injuns ?" asked the&#xD;
Wagoner.&#xD;
"Forty-five hundred and sixty days," answered Jack with a me.-&#xD;
lodious sigh.&#xD;
"Whillikens !" exclaimed the host,---why that's a matter of--&#xD;

"A   ptter of ten years and a half," said the host.&#xD;
"Moreover,"observed Jack, feeling "digiste dat himself or tel--&#xD;

long while before we were captured by the Indians."&#xD;
"Lord;sakes !" exclaimed theWagoner, "do telius -sonme, ofyour&#xD;

"Yes, tell us some of your adventer," echoed the proprietor,&#xD;
"and I'll'stand' another bottle."&#xD;

"No, curse me if you do," exclaimed Dick, "for I mean to stand&#xD;

for he hadn't the remotest idea of paying for anything and donht -&#xD;
less Jack had the same thought, as he also insisted upon making&#xD;
the next bottle his, own personalamatter.&#xD;
Opinions being, therefore, of a conflicting  nature, 'Jack suggest-&#xD;
ed a compromise, and-the resultwas that four bottles were order-&#xD;
edinstead of o. The landlord, of the Bear. then proposed the&#xD;
health of the Sing Captives, and the Wagoner seconded the motion,&#xD;
but a difficulty 'here arose s to which bottle the Health should be&#xD;
drunk from. This time pick settled the matter by proposing to&#xD;
mix them altogether in a large bowl, and so, after a short debate,&#xD;
as to t  l ohe proper   of the thing, Jack's iadeira, Dick's bran dy,&#xD;
the        d's sherry, and the Wagoner's Hollands were duly&#xD;
emptied into a large' bowl according to theproposition. The health&#xD;
of the Captives was  now drunk, after which Jack discdaed upon&#xD;
the obvious propriety of drinking the Bear's health, and then&#xD;

declared in very choice language, that it was absolutely necessary&#xD;
to drink the Wagoner's ;also.&#xD;
Tmfell asleep upon one of the benches, and lay there without&#xD;
being thought of during the evening.&#xD;
Loud calls were now made by'the landlord and the Wgoner for&#xD;
a relation of the late North-Western Captives' adventures with the&#xD;
Sing tribe, and Jack (after proposing health 'all around again) de-&#xD;
clared his readiness to obey their wishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ROBBERY.                 63&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well," said Jack, "Il started in opany'with my friend here,&#xD;
and about a dozen othei gentlemen, of the same profession as our-&#xD;
"What profession's that?" asked' the landlord. He was becom-&#xD;
ing decidedly oblivious, and consequently required information up-&#xD;
on' every point.&#xD;
-Counsel's Fee Dispensers,",replied Jack with dignity. "We&#xD;
started-."&#xD;
"Hold on," hiccoughed the Wagoner, "I neverr heard of 'em&#xD;
afore. What's the name,?-but it doesn't make any odds. Let's&#xD;
drink their healths anyhow."&#xD;
We must here remark as a singular fact, that although the Cap..&#xD;
tivae had every appearance of being in, a shockingly intqxicated&#xD;
state, they were in reality not in the least affected , for they' had a&#xD;
queer way of waiting till the others raised their glasses to-their&#xD;
lips, and thep spilling the contents of their own upon'"the floor.&#xD;
But the perceptive faculties of the Proprietor, and Tim's friend,&#xD;
the Wagoner, were rapidly diminishing, for they became very so-&#xD;
ciable, and kept continually drinking each othei's health, and shak-&#xD;
ing each other's hands,, and,.in a confidential way, uttering dismal&#xD;
sounds which were intended for derisive peals of 'laughter at the&#xD;
North;westers' supposed inebriation. The adventures were lost&#xD;
sight of.&#xD;
"Gen'l'men," obsertred' the Wagoner, "let's try our h--hands at&#xD;
a--song-what dy'e say--hic!--eh?"&#xD;
Jack very readily expressed his willingness, so did Dick, but&#xD;
as the Bear experienced great difficulty incoming to any kind of&#xD;
a conclusion upon the question, the enthusiastic Wagoner took it&#xD;
into his head that a ballad entertainment 'was Uthanimously desired;&#xD;
so after an ineffectual attempt to clear his throat, he commenced a&#xD;
dolorous ditty about a time when he was a maiden of bashful six-&#xD;
teen, but unfortunately broke down in the middle of the second&#xD;
line. 'Hereupon the host took the floor with a chair under his right&#xD;
hand and another under his left, and sailed off upon a vocal cruise&#xD;
to the Bay of Biscay, but being in an unseaworthy condition, his&#xD;
mainbraees parted suddenly and 'he struck and keeled over, with a&#xD;

*And the noise waked andbrought in.his wife--a young comely-&#xD;
looking woman-who sighed;heavily. at, witnessing the miserable&#xD;
condition of her husband, but without uttering a word, she assisted'&#xD;
him to rise, and half supported, half dragged him from the room.&#xD;
And at-this the Wagoner uttered more dismal sonnds, which he&#xD;
intended as before, for laughter, and proposed more healths and&#xD;
more melodies'; but as it was getting on towards midnight, Jack&#xD;
urged that fact, as a reason for declining, and volunteered to assist&#xD;
him to bed. The Wagoner, however, asserted his ability to go to&#xD;
bed without any body's assistance, andigave himself the lie im-&#xD;
mediately after by falling head-long to the floor. And Jack's feel-&#xD;
ings of humanity were touched by the maw's helplessness, so he&#xD;
raised him from the floor to one of the benches, and' took his watch&#xD;
and pocket book into his own possession for safe-keeping.&#xD;
"Pretty good," he remarked in a low tone to his accomplice,&#xD;
'and it worked even better ,thanI hoped.*Now, if I could onl&#xD;
find the boy-s&#xD;
"He's here," whispered Dick, and he pointed to the bench up-&#xD;
n which Tim was sl&amp;amp;piing.&#xD;
The desperado looked intently at Thn for a moment, and then,&#xD;
as if satisfied he had conjectured rightly, shook him till he awoke.&#xD;
"Come my lad," said the ruffian, your friend wishes you to go&#xD;
on with me to town, and to-morrow he'll meet you there. Jump&#xD;
up, for we' re in a hurry."&#xD;
And Tim obeyed, thinking it was very strange; but he knew no-&#xD;
thing of the world,: and, therefore, had no suspicion.&#xD;
Then Brently opened a side door, and they moved noiselessly to&#xD;
the stables , but they were obliged toforce the stable door open,&#xD;
and to gag the hostler,:before they could get out their;horses. And&#xD;
these proceedings began to surpriseTim; yetbefore he could mus.&#xD;
ter sufficient resolutjon' to attempt an escape, he. found himself&#xD;
mounted behind Dick, and going very rapidly down the road.-&#xD;
The Wagoner worked himself up into a fearful state of mind,&#xD;
next morning when he discovered. his loss, but it was too late. As&#xD;
for the lanidlord, he was so shocked. at the occurrence that he took&#xD;
his wife and his miserable guest aside, and swore to them that he&#xD;
&#xD;
"never again would get'drunk with any man without having, been&#xD;
previously acquainted with him and 'all 4his family for at least three&#xD;
successive generations!"&#xD;
CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH.&#xD;
TIE CRIB ON CROSS STREET t.&#xD;
The classic precincts known as the Five Points, were, twenty&#xD;
years ago even' less respectable than they are now. Ragged pover-.&#xD;
ty, abject and miserable, and Crime contaminating and blood-stain-&#xD;
ed, here, like another Gorgon, raised a hideous front,-and turned&#xD;
beholders into stone. The very air was impregnated with the fe-&#xD;
tors oozhg from the grimed sinks of villainy around, and was poi-&#xD;
sonous-tobreathe. On one of the streets--the most wretched and&#xD;
foul in the vicinage, stood a dingy, vile-looking, rickety house, the&#xD;
mere sight of which was sufficient to cause a chilling and uncon-&#xD;
fortable feeling to the chance passer-by,,and he was bold indeed if&#xD;
he lingered to take a second glance at it. In past days an outside&#xD;
staircase had gone up to a door on the first floor, but forsome rea-&#xD;
son it was taken away afterwards, and now the only entrance to&#xD;
the front of the houde, was through an area door, four or. five feet&#xD;
below the side-walk, to reach which'you descended several dis-&#xD;
sipated looking stone-steps.&#xD;
Over this door was nailed a crooked little board -with queer hie-&#xD;
roglyphics upon it; '(said by .the knowing ones to mean "Lodging&#xD;
House,") and further embellished by a representation of a plethoric&#xD;
'black bottle, which "at bolt upright; and, =without having any ap-&#xD;
parent projecting' power in itself, spouted quantities of corks, and&#xD;
ari inexhaustible stream of whitish-°broivn liquid into a smaller ob-&#xD;

difficult to inderstand.:iOpposite he doo ,or rather running from&#xD;
itwasaovery marrew andv grydark pas age -with, a very creaky,&#xD;
springy floor, leading to several subterraney anpartments, and a,&#xD;
very contracted stairway ; the whole presenting a very suspicious&#xD;
appearance generally. The first door to the left opened into a large,&#xD;
square room with a low ceiling, very much discolored walls, and a&#xD;
particularly-dirty floor.-though the-dirt on the floor was little no-&#xD;
ticed on account ofthe utter hopelessness of a ray of light getting&#xD;
through the dirty little window without becoming in the contact&#xD;
decidedly impure also., To be sure, there were two or three tin&#xD;
sconces hanging 'uponthe wall;,-containingeach a. decayed tallow&#xD;
candle; but these candles looked stumpy and forlorn, as though they&#xD;
were disgusted with existence, and were  anxious to go out as soon&#xD;
as pos ible.-In ,one partsof the room was an. indefnite looking ar-&#xD;
rangerent, which proved-upon, minute inspection, to. be a place&#xD;
'where might be realized the symbolical devices, we have spoken of&#xD;
m-in other words, it was the "bar."  It was built of stout planks,&#xD;
and contained a door:and a shutter (the latter arranged so as to fall&#xD;
inside and formia counter) both of which could be readily closed&#xD;
whenrCircumstances rendered it necessary. Fastened upon the&#xD;
walls were p number df:unframed priits, and drawings-portraits&#xD;
of notedthieves, prize-fighters and-infamous women-and some&#xD;
few sketches of very dubious ,morality. Stationary benches, rough&#xD;
pine-tables much hacked with knives, and a rickety arm-chair, with&#xD;
a very uncomfortable back, composed the ariture.&#xD;
The only occupants of this miserable den were a man and a wo-&#xD;
inan-the man oeupying the chair,, and bent slightly forward as&#xD;
hough he was listening to hear some signal from the outside, the&#xD;
woman reclining upon a bench, and apparently, asleep. She was&#xD;
clad tin a enarse gray fioksnomethingsimilar ,rto those: then worn&#xD;
by .prisoners,'which. itted ier loosely, and displayed, in the almost&#xD;
entire absence 'of under garments, a form which,.though faded, was&#xD;
still reunded and sy metrical. Her h ir was long and flowingand&#xD;
would have,,le   eleg ht but for.,its diahevelled and neglected&#xD;
-state, and her feat ries, tho' worn andcltouded yet hore the treces&#xD;
of former lo el iness.and beauty.&#xD;
&#xD;
The. man was no'other than our old acquaintance Bill, the 'ac-&#xD;
complice and quandum coachman of Brently. He was-the proprie-&#xD;
tor of this snug establishment, and therefore the reader can readily&#xD;
form an estimate of its character, For the twentieth time during&#xD;
the night, a sound outside caused him to start up and leave the&#xD;
room.--This time, however, he returned with a grim smile diffused&#xD;
over his ugly countenance, for Jack and Dick, whom he had been&#xD;
expecting, were with him. Poor Tim 'followed,.shuddering with&#xD;
fear.&#xD;
"Curse me if I wasn't beginning to think you'd been lagged,"&#xD;
exclaimed Bill. "Why, what 'have you been doing all this time ?"&#xD;
"I was hunting up the woman," replied Jack, "that in times past&#xD;
you and I attempted to get hold ,of, on the joint stock principle, as&#xD;
far as her money went.",&#xD;
The woman on the bench suddenly opened her eyes and gazed&#xD;
upon the speaker. Then an expression of joy lit up her face, and&#xD;
next, a frown of deadly hatred clouded it again. Yet she neither&#xD;
spoke or moved, but soon closed her eyes again and seemed as be-&#xD;
fore to be in a deep sleep.&#xD;
"And I suppose you went all the way up there, didn't you ?"&#xD;
growled Bill, for he was not in the best of humors at hearing of&#xD;
such an unprofitable excursion.&#xD;
"No,"replied Jack, "for before I reached there, I heard that she&#xD;
had quit the place' some years ago."&#xD;
"I could havetold you that myself," said Bill. ."She has gone&#xD;
off, the devil knows where-to Europe, I suppose-and-)&#xD;
"No, Bill," interrupted Brently, "she's here, and I not only dis-&#xD;
covered the exact spot on which she lives, but I met her ,face to&#xD;
face."&#xD;
Well, what did you, do ?" asked Bill,&#xD;
"I attempted to carry her off," replied Brently, but was unex..&#xD;
pect edly interrupted. I tell you, Bill, she shan't escape me, no, not&#xD;
if all the fiends should interpose between us,'&#xD;
"I suppose'the fool's married again, isn't sh"  asked Bill.&#xD;
"No, she's still 'single, answered Brently, 1and, rich, - rich&#xD;
enough to venture all for. We must concoct a plan at once."&#xD;

"Who's that Kiddy there?" asked ,Billyabruptly as he pointed&#xD;
towards our hero.&#xD;
"A.milkstone," answered Brently. "I say, Dick, show theboy&#xD;
to bed and',let him sleep if he wishes to. And Dick, you needn't&#xD;
return,:if you don't want.'&#xD;
"All right, Jack, I'm fly," returned Dick, and he led Tim out&#xD;
into the dark passage, and disappeared with him.'&#xD;
Then.Jack told his accomplice-of the'robbery,and produced his&#xD;
gains, which amounted to considerable ; then he went on to tell&#xD;
who Tim was, and why he brought him there, and"what his- plans&#xD;
Were withregard to Isabel., And Bill-pronounced them good, and&#xD;
agreed to co-operate with himupon which Jack desired him to mix&#xD;
him a strong glass.of grog, and take another himself, to. drink suc-&#xD;
cess to the enterprise, which was done.&#xD;
And .the woman 'heard all and-eaw all, though she remained&#xD;
quiet, and seemingly asleep.. J'But Brently's eye. suddenly fell up-&#xD;
onher, and. his faceflushed with anger, as he grasped Bill's, arm,.&#xD;
and demanded who sherwas, and why he had"notwarned him she.&#xD;

she was:to other thannhis'former mistress, 'Caroline, who, ,having&#xD;
escaped from the asylum two days before, cameito his (Bill's)-house,.&#xD;

rage, and he;drw'adirk-,knife from-his bosom.&#xD;
"What!" he exclaimed, "dares she cross my path. again, to act&#xD;
the spy and 'betray me tas she did before? But PIl stop that game&#xD;
at once."&#xD;
And he sprang towards her,. and .would haye murdered her as&#xD;

his powerful arms about him and forced him back.&#xD;
"Damn you!" muttered Bill, "would you ki'llrasleepihn maniac?"&#xD;

"'I aint afraid of that," returned Bill,-"she hasn't sense enough."&#xD;
"In the devils name, why did you permit her to oome here,?"&#xD;
demanded the other.&#xD;
Because I intended to make her useful hereafter," replied the&#xD;
second ruffian.&#xD;
"By--, she shall not stay," cried Brently.&#xD;
"And I say, she shall!" retorted Bill angrily. "Look you, Jack,&#xD;

you daren't attack any but 'Mad-women and kiddys, and then only&#xD;
when-they're asleep."&#xD;
Without uttering a word,, Brently raised his knife again, and&#xD;
dashed at his accomplice, for the last taunt;had cut him to the&#xD;
qnick and he would have died to have revenge.- But Bill grasped&#xD;
his arm and wrested the knife from him, and then they grappled with&#xD;
each other and fell upon.the -loorb  And Caroline rose from her&#xD;
recumbent postL -e and looked on wonderingly,, for it was a strange&#xD;
thing to see two men,-who, for a score of years, had been closely&#xD;
united by a brotherhood of;oriie, thus forget their own interests&#xD;
and struggle for each other's:lives. EHalf a, dozen ruffianly men,&#xD;
and several debauched, wretched-looking and nearly nude women,&#xD;
were aroused from their polluted couches by the noise, and. they&#xD;
sauntered into the rooin'and:formed a circle around the combatants,&#xD;
but did not interfere; for" most of them had been participants in&#xD;
scenes like this, and their hearts were as so many flints, without&#xD;
feeling or human sympathy. ,At last Bill threw off the other's hold&#xD;
and clutched him by: the ,throat, and the lookers-on held their&#xD;
breaths, and bent, their: heads forward, as if they were eager to&#xD;
witness each act of the Death Spectacle that apparently was soon-to&#xD;
be enacted. Brently felt the other's knee upon his breast-he saw&#xD;
him raise the knife, and with a bitter curse at fortune he closed his&#xD;
eyes and awaited the life-annihilating blow.&#xD;

CHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH.&#xD;
SLOVER5 QUARREL.&#xD;
&#xD;
Isabel's house stood upon a gentle eminence some four hundred&#xD;
yards above the road, and about double the distance above the ri-&#xD;
ver's bank. It was stirrounded on all sides by a park of an extent&#xD;
and beauty seldom to be seen in these leveling days,' and was ap-&#xD;
proached from the main road by a graveled way which looked par-&#xD;
ticularly enticing with its canopy of green and the bright flowers&#xD;
which lined its sides. Here and there about the grounds stood neat&#xD;
trellised arbors, covered with fruitful vines 'and fragrant honey-&#xD;
suckles, and each contained rural couches which seemed to invite&#xD;
repose and nundane forgetfulness. There was a miniature lake,&#xD;
too, on the premises, in which Egeria was particularly fond of ang-&#xD;
ling, and would angle,} whenever Harry was most anxious she&#xD;
should do something else. The house itself was built after the&#xD;
Elizabethian style; a tasty one-and the designer had especial re-&#xD;
gard to comfort and convenience as well as beauty in the construc-&#xD;
tion. It was but a story and a half high, but very large and roomy&#xD;
nevertheless, and furnished with a degree of elegance and taste&#xD;
that made it seem a very, Paradise. 'A portico, with a tesselated&#xD;
flooring extended entirely around the  building, and upon the roof&#xD;
was perched a small observatory in which Uncle Jacob delighted to&#xD;
spend an hour in star-gazing and meditation after the family retired&#xD;
to rest.&#xD;
It was the sixth day after the incidents set forth in our twelfth&#xD;
chapter.' The stranger had sufficiently recovered from his wound&#xD;
to walk about the grounds, and how could it 'have been otherwise&#xD;
when he had two such nurses as Isabel and Egeria to minister to&#xD;
his wants? True he had received merely a flesh wound, but he&#xD;
had lost a deal of 'blood, which reduced him greatly, and brought&#xD;
on a fever. The fever however was checked after the fourth day,&#xD;
and now he was'well as ever, with the exception of the weakness&#xD;
naturally consequent upon losses of blood and fevers generally.&#xD;
Towards the close of the afternoon of'this day, Isabel, Egeria,&#xD;
Harry and the stranger were leisurely walking about the grounds-&#xD;

the ladies wearingjeyous looks, and theeditknien joy-less ones:'&#xD;
Isabel felt joyous because her deliverer had recovered from his&#xD;
wound ; Egeria felt joyous simply because she had no reason to&#xD;
be otherwise; Harry felt joyless because ,Egeria would not consent-&#xD;
to make. him joyous-; and the stranger felt joyless because many&#xD;
painful recollections pressed upou:jhis heart.&#xD;
And for some time they walked on .without uttering a word, but&#xD;
at length Egeria became troubled with ennui..&#xD;
"Harry, you're a mere automaton,"she-"exclaimed,."why don't&#xD;
you say, something P 'There! see that beautiful butterfly ! Run and&#xD;
catch it for me like a good allow."  But Harry pretended not to&#xD;
hear.&#xD;
"She wants to'get me out of the way so that she may flirt with&#xD;
the stranger," thought he.&#xD;
"Why don't you go?" demanded Egeria imperiously.&#xD;
"I believe, she's half in; love with 'him," continued Harry to him-&#xD;
self "and she thinks I don't see it."&#xD;
"Well," exclaimed Egeria impatiently,."are you going after it or&#xD;
not? But never mind, 1'l catch it myself; so stay where you are,&#xD;
and don't dare to followsme&#xD;
Away she ran after the butterfly, and it was not long before she&#xD;
disappeared. 'Then Harry felt more uncomfortable than before, and&#xD;
he settled in his own mind that she was decidedly anxious to avoid&#xD;
his society. Hb was thoroughly }onyinced of it, in fact, otherwise&#xD;
would she run away thus and tell him he should not follow. Here-&#xD;
tofore she had always commanded thim to do so. She wanted to&#xD;
break his: heart,' that was,evident; but he determined he'd not per-&#xD;
mit her to break it-not even to crack it in the. slightest degree.&#xD;
No ; he'd go off 'to'town and never return or look upon her more.&#xD;
But, perhaps-yes, upon -second thought, he would let her know&#xD;
his-intention first-that was only fair; so he mutteredai few in-&#xD;
coinprehensible words to Isabel,-by'way of excusing himself, and,&#xD;
went off rapidly after Egeria. Without doubt this was exactly what&#xD;
Egeria wished, but Harry was,- as we have before stated, fright-&#xD;
fully in love, and as a natural consequence, was so blind as to be able&#xD;
to see-r--figuratively speaking-.only through green spectacles. He&#xD;
&#xD;
found her in one, of the beautiful trellis bowers, and when she saw&#xD;
him she exclaimed-&#xD;
"Now, didn't I tell you not to follow me? I never can have a&#xD;
moment to myself.&#xD;
"You shall not complain of that hereafter, "returned the lugu-&#xD;
brious victim,."for before night-fall, I shall be in the city."&#xD;
"Really 1" excimend Egeria.: "But what difference will that&#xD;
make, when before night-fall to-mgr row, you will have returned&#xD;
again?"&#xD;
"You mistake," said the lover, "I-will pnot return to-morrow."&#xD;
'The day after, then, or the following," asserted the beauty. "It&#xD;
makes little 'difference."&#xD;
"True, he replied, "it is immaterial. But it will not be on the&#xD;
following day, or the following week, month, or year, it will not&#xD;
be&#xD;
Egeria felt somewhat startled, and interrupted him. "Why&#xD;
Harry?" she cried, "you're -surely not in earnest I"&#xD;
"I am serious," he answered gravely, "I design leaving this part&#xD;
of the country."&#xD;
"Are you going back to college again ?", she asked innocently.&#xD;
College! She was endeavoring to insult him now ; that was quite&#xD;
plain-he had no doubt of it.&#xD;
"It is rather an unlooked for determination," continued Egeria,&#xD;
"but doubtless a wise one, for you have yet much to learn, poor&#xD;
fellow," and she sighed deeply.&#xD;
"I have learned too much of late for my own peace, and now I&#xD;
must endeavor to unlearn it all. . I will remain here no longer to be&#xD;
the object of mirth and the capriciousness of-of-no matter ! I&#xD;
have had -a bitter lesson, and shall profit by it hereafter."&#xD;
"Why Harry!", cried Egeria, with a forced laugh, (for the gipsy&#xD;
knew well enough what he meant,) "what can that be you know so&#xD;
much of that it is necessary for your peace you should unlearn it?"&#xD;
Harry fastened the top button of his coat with an air of despera-&#xD;
tion. "That I have ever loved you," he said.&#xD;
"Oh, the task will not be difficult, sir," returned Egeria with&#xD;
sudden pique, you are therefore unnecessarily alarmed. Do not,&#xD;

however, waste the tine that shbul'd be employed in forwarding-&#xD;
so laudable an object-I-I can dispense with jou rpresenee, sir,&#xD;
be assured."=&#xD;
"In that case, Miss Wilton," sad=Harry, "I will take my leave.&#xD;
Farewell."  But'he didn't iove ,n inch.&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Chesterr returned Egeria; "you are quite free to&#xD;
go, if you desire to do so. There is     he door," she would&#xD;
have said hdd not' her heart taken partagainst her tongue and sent&#xD;
up a sob to silence it.&#xD;
"Since y ou i sl 'me to go," stammered the 'lover-"I say, since&#xD;
jou-particulaly desirerme'to go, I must obey your commands. I-"&#xD;
"I have no recollection of commanding or even desiring you to&#xD;
go,", interrupted the younggirl.I said you'were free to do-so."&#xD;
"No matter, Miss Wilton," said the simple fellow. ,'You nieant&#xD;
it-that's the same thing. You have scorned my love, you have&#xD;
trampled upon my feelings, you have had the cruelty to show, in so&#xD;
marked a manner, your preference for another-"&#xD;
"My preference for another l' exclaimed Egeria with real as-&#xD;
tonishment. "Why, who could that have been ? Surely 'not father ?&#xD;
f'or I nust love him, you'know," she added artlessly.&#xD;
"Pshaw!" ekelaimedHarry, "I mean this stranger."&#xD;
"Our guest !" cried Egeria, with a merry laughs "Why, you#&#xD;
don't suppose I prefer hitm to you, do you?'"&#xD;
"With good reason, I think," answered Harry, a little staggered&#xD;
by this last remark, "didn't you visit him four or five times a day&#xD;
during his illness, and were you not always eager to-t-"&#xD;
"Why, what nonsense you a-e uttering!" interrupted the beau-&#xD;
ty. "Was he not wounded in- rescuing Cousin: Belle from those&#xD;
vila wretches,? Common gratitude demanded that we should pay&#xD;
him every attention."&#xD;
"Yes, yes, I know, don't say any more," cried the poor lover.&#xD;
"I never thought of that. What a consummate idiot! But 1'll run&#xD;
and beg his pardon-"&#xD;
"Why, you surely did not insult him ?'? asked Egeria with a&#xD;
look of alarm.&#xD;
"No, I didn't iisul him;" he answered.&#xD;
&#xD;

"Nor behave rudely to him ?"&#xD;
"No, I only thought of doing -so.&#xD;
"Then, there's nonecessity for begging his pardon," said Ege-&#xD;
ria, her face glowing with pleasure again. "Come, sit by my side.&#xD;
Don't be afraisl-there! now look me in the face, and give me your&#xD;
right hand, for I'm going to ask you.a few questions. You said you&#xD;
would be in town before nightfall 2"&#xD;
"Yes, I know I did, but I've _altered my mind and shall stay&#xD;
"You also said that I had taught you a bitter lesson ?"&#xD;
"I meant a sweet one. You taught me to love you to distraction."&#xD;
"But you-said you wished to unlearn that ?"&#xD;
Ah, but it was, only that I might have the felicity of being taught&#xD;
egain."&#xD;
"I intended trying to unlearn the self-same thing, but I fear I&#xD;
would also pain myself in paining you," said the young girl inge-&#xD;
niously.&#xD;
"Then you do love me-a little 2" asked the lover, in a very&#xD;
tremulous and anxious tone.&#xD;
"And she answered with all the fervor of an innocent heart, "I&#xD;
love you dearly,  Harry," and turned aside her head to hide her&#xD;
blushes, but Harry in his ecstacy, so far lost sight of discretion as&#xD;
to clasp her in his arms and press his first kiss upon her rosy lips,&#xD;
and as. she made but slight resistance, doubtless he would have&#xD;
had an indefinite number of kisses more, had not Uncle Jacob, by&#xD;
the simplest accident in.the world,.,suddenly. entered the bower.&#xD;
Of course, (asis usual in such cases.) from .beirig embraced by her,&#xD;
lover, Egeria went to embracing her father, andlHarry dropped&#xD;
upon his knees by her side, in a very striking manner, and looked&#xD;
askant.into the old man's face.&#xD;
And Uncle Jacob's heart, was joyous, so he placed a, hand upon&#xD;
the head of each, and, breathed a silent but fervent pt ayer that&#xD;
peace, prosperity and happiness might attend their, union, and that&#xD;
their days might be long in the land.&#xD;

The stratiger whoshadunconsciously'r'catised Harry so much in=&#xD;
ttanquility 's- ourdld acquaintanee, George Walters.&#xD;
Two weeks previous to the night of the wagei-, he had' returned&#xD;
tow his native place, aft@  long absence'to takd possession of a&#xD;
large property bequeathed him by a distant relative; .and having&#xD;
completed his' business, would 'haedelarte lf'rom scenes which&#xD;
depressed and saddened himtingupon'the foloing dar, had not that&#xD;
detestable event caused- hins t© defer'rhis journey.;&#xD;
'Th a nihi h returned to'hi-,lodgings digested with the world&#xD;
and himself, and sick at heart. Early next morning a letter -with&#xD;
a2 B sta post-'ark wan handed him, pirprrting to have been&#xD;
written at the request 'of one of his oldest,  d° dearest friends,&#xD;
(name not mentioned,) who was on his death-bed, and begged ot'&#xD;
him to come on Without a-moment's-delay, as matters of "most vital&#xD;
import to those he loved" were to be imparted to him. -'The name-&#xD;
o an "eminent Bostin merehaitwa 'affixed as 'the writers We may&#xD;
as well stateiere, that Brently fearful of the young man's interpo-&#xD;
sition, had concocted a second letter on that night (the one in ques.&#xD;
tion) in the hope that it would 'indtwee him to proceed to Boston.&#xD;
Once there ;he cared not how soon the stratagem was discovered,&#xD;
as he hoped to be beyond Walters' reach4 long before it was' possi-&#xD;
ble for himto return. Walters had nosuspicion, for the circum..&#xD;
stance, though unusual, was natural enough, and so, for the time,&#xD;
he waived all other considerations, and at oncedeparted. Upon his&#xD;
arrival in Boston, he, ofi course, at tonne discovered he had been&#xD;
duped ; and conjecturing truly that Brently was the:author, he&#xD;
burned'to avenge himself, and embarked upon another vessel to re-&#xD;
turn&#xD;
The ship was obliged to leave port without her full complement&#xD;
of men, and unfortunately on the second night out, a' violent storm&#xD;
broke over them, and before the crew could obey the order to furl&#xD;
all, the foretopsail blew out of the bolt ropes,' flew away to lee-&#xD;
&#xD;
ward, and the spar snapped and 'went 'overthe side carrying three&#xD;
poor fellows with it. All was confusion, the ship became un--&#xD;
manageable, dashed nadly before the gale far out to .da, and finally&#xD;
there was a stunningcrash-avivid flash-a cry of agony, the light=&#xD;
ning had struck the ship-she was in flames!= 'A raft was hastily&#xD;
constructed, and on it they tossed 'about helplessly until after se-&#xD;
veral days they were picked up by a merchant-man bound for the&#xD;
Mediterranean. But misfortune still followed'them. No .sooner&#xD;
had they passed the straits, than they were overhauled by Algerino&#xD;
pirates, captured and driven into slavery. From this slavery Wal-&#xD;
1ers had but latdy escaped and returned to his native land.&#xD;
He and Isabel had, known each other in times long gone, by, but&#xD;
care and hardships had so changed him, that his former friends no&#xD;
longer recognized him.,, True,, there was a something in his coun-&#xD;
tenanee and in the tone of his -voice, that Isabel thought familiar,&#xD;
but she quickly banished that thought a$ achimera,.-and endeavor-&#xD;
ed to forget it. 'For his, manner was reserved and, every cold to-&#xD;
wards her, and he seldom spoke unless she first addressed him,&#xD;
and then it was with averted eyes and a faultering tongue. Still,&#xD;
a secret feeling-gratitude perhaps--attracted, her towards . him,&#xD;
and she longed to raise the veil of mystery whichsurrounded him&#xD;
and know himas he had been and as he was.&#xD;
After their young companions left them they walked on in si-&#xD;
lence. Both were busy with their thoughts--thoughts perhaps of&#xD;
each other-who could, tell? At length, Isabel raised her eyes to&#xD;
her companion's face, and she fancied that a degree of pallor, much&#xD;
greater than had marked it since his recovery, now overspread it.&#xD;
.And Walters suddenly dropped, her arm, and staggered ngaiinst a&#xD;
tree, but seeing that his fair hostess was about to call for assist-&#xD;
ance, he forced a smile, and endeavored to assure her that it was a&#xD;
mere faintness that would pass away as rapidly as it came.&#xD;
"Nay, Madam," he' continued, "I have already  uit.e rearedd&#xD;
and I know not how to apologise for the alarm I have given you."&#xD;
"Apologise, Mr; Wa1ers!" exclaimed Isabel, "it is I that should&#xD;
apologise for having been so thoughtless as to overtask your&#xD;
strength. But we will return. My uncle will be. difficult to ap-&#xD;

pease, when he learnshow little regard I have shown for the well-&#xD;
being of one to whom I owe so much."&#xD;
"Nay, Madam," cried Walters,-'I beg 'you will not again allude&#xD;
to.a service which might have been performed as well by any other&#xD;
man. And do not doubt my strength, for it is': sufficiently re-es-&#xD;
tablished to make me feel that I need trespass upon your hospitali-&#xD;
ties no-longer.&#xD;
Oh, sir, you do not design leaving us as yet?" asked Isabel&#xD;
quickly.&#xD;
"To-morrow,;Madam," replied Walters. But seeing that her&#xD;
countenance expressed surprise-.as he supposed it--he added:&#xD;
"My path through life has ever been, -and ever will be, a dark and&#xD;
dreary:one. When -a-ray-of sunshine chances to fall upon it, I treat&#xD;
it as a pleasing dream 'from which -I soon must wake to feel more&#xD;
sensibly the sad reality. Your goodnessyour kindness to one you&#xD;
know not, save by his own report-"&#xD;
"I beg you will not allude to that," interrupted Isabel. "I have&#xD;
but done my duty-nothing more."&#xD;
"Yes," exclaimed Walters, sadly, "in that light I know you look&#xD;
upon the charitable office you performed, and I feel that if I dared&#xD;
once more open my heart and raise -again an image there, too soon&#xD;
I'd find 'twas but another dream and fall beneath the blow. No,&#xD;
to me the past is all a blank, the present joyless, and the future&#xD;
hopeless and forbidding,"&#xD;
"Oh, do not think so," cried Isabel, "a happy future may yet&#xD;
open to you, for surely you have=friends, if not relatives, who love&#xD;
you-"&#xD;
"Ah, Madam," answered Walters, "after losing the best part&#xD;
of youth in foreign bondage, I returned to my native land but to&#xD;
learn that all my kindred have gone down -to"the tomb, and that&#xD;
among the few friends remaining whom Ilved in happier days,&#xD;
none -recognize me-now. I am a stranger, 'Madam, eveno on the&#xD;
spot where I was born, an outcast from all hope, a man that' des&#xD;
tiny decreed= should live a wanderer, and die, at last, unnoticed and&#xD;
unmourned."&#xD;
Isabel was deeply moved. "Nay,"she exlaimed, "here, at least,&#xD;
&#xD;
you will always find true friends, here you will be at all times wel-&#xD;
come, here you will ever meet one whose heart regard: you -"&#xD;
She paused suddenly, for Walters' eyes were fixed upon her&#xD;
with an expression of eager interest, and her face flushed as she&#xD;
added-.&#xD;
"With sisterly esteem,"&#xD;
The young man's eyes fell to the ground again, and he sighed&#xD;
heavily, but he spoke not, for his brain. was whirling.&#xD;
Instinctively, (for neither marked the path they took,) they walk-&#xD;
ed towards the house. Uncle Jacob met them at the porch, his face&#xD;
radiant with joy, and he remarked to Isabel, that he had pleasing&#xD;
news to' tell her, , Upon which Walters muttered some incoherent&#xD;
-words, and walked rapidly away-.-lhe heeded not whither-and did&#xD;
not pause till he reached the river's bank. - Then he looked upon&#xD;
the deep rolling :waters and thought of suicide.&#xD;
"Why," thought he, "should a friendless, unloved wanderer&#xD;
like me struggle through hopeless years to come, when an eternal&#xD;
sleep might there be mine ? What is the wealth I have inherited&#xD;
but an additional curse upon me to make me doubt my fellow man&#xD;
,andview advances with suspicion. In whom can I confide,-fromn&#xD;
whom can I expect regard, should I begin life anew,:and endeavor&#xD;
to forget the past?-None! all who loved me are at rest, and it is&#xD;
too late, too late now to inspire disinterested friendship. And to&#xD;
meet her again-to be compelled to endure the double agony of&#xD;
knowing that although I have won her gratitude, her heart still&#xD;
remains, untouched, and. never can be mine. Of what avail would&#xD;
self-imposed banishment now be to me, with those sweet tones&#xD;
ringing in my ears, and that loved form to haunt me night and day?&#xD;
What but misery more bitter than I have yet endured ? Why then&#xD;
should I struggle.on? No! let the end be now-destiny, be thou at&#xD;
once accomplished!"&#xD;
But .as the half frantic man was advancing towards the river,&#xD;
the villain Brently suddenly started from the wood and struck him&#xD;
a heavy blow from behind. Walters turned instinctively to grap.-&#xD;
ple with his assailant, when a second and heavier blow was given&#xD;
him, and he fell senseless and without a groan upon the bank.&#xD;

CHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH.&#xD;
TII ABbTCTION&#xD;
That night Isabelawaited Walters' return in vainAs the hours&#xD;
wore away, she became more and more alarmed, but she kept her&#xD;
apprehensions-to.herself, .for ucli was-the happiness -Iof those,&#xD;
around her, that she ,felt 'twould be unkind were she to chill them&#xD;
with calamitous forebodings. Egeria and Harry scarcely noticed&#xD;
Walters' abenee, for lovre, bright and ennling though it is, yet&#xD;
beyond its immediate object is.not untinged with selfishness. Un-&#xD;
cle Jacob, indeed, was ill at ease; but he forebore the least allu-&#xD;
sion to the matter, lest he should alarm his'niece and daughter. At&#xD;
lengthy Egeria- retired'to rest,:and then Isabel hastily communicat-&#xD;
ed her fears to 'the good old man, and urged an immediate search&#xD;
about the grouxdes&#xD;
"You alarm yourself unnecessarily, my dear Isabel," said Uncle&#xD;
Jacob, with-an 'assumed carelessness. "May not our guest have&#xD;
wandered off and lost his way, and then sought shelter at some inn&#xD;
or house -till morning."}&#xD;
;Heaven grant it may be so!"a'murmured Isabel,' "but I have a&#xD;
strange presentiment that some evil has befallen him. -Oh, uncle,&#xD;
in such a grateful light do I viow the serviceshe-rendered us that&#xD;
I have ceased to look upon him as a stranger, but rather as a dear&#xD;
and cherished brother: Think, uncle, he has not 'fully recovered&#xD;

"I will wake up Tom and Peter at once," said Uncle Jacob;&#xD;
"with Harry here and those two men, I can search the country for&#xD;
three miles around in as many hours."&#xD;
"Take John With you, also, uncle,", urged Isabel, "you might-&#xD;
require him, too."&#xD;
"No, he had better remain in case of accident," said Uncle Ja..&#xD;
cob; "you must have at least one protector.'&#xD;
"Take him, uncle, take him," cried the excited lady ; "no dan-&#xD;
ger need be apprehended here. It is in the open-air that we should&#xD;
fear it, not within bolted doors.-Now, uncle,.humor me in this."&#xD;
"I will," replied the old gentleman, "but you must promise me&#xD;
to retire at once to your own chamber, and not to leave it before&#xD;
mnornings&#xD;
"I promise."&#xD;
"Then we'shall set off at once," he said .band if you don't see&#xD;
this brother of yours in the breakfast room to-morrow morning, say&#xD;
I'm a bad prophet. -'There, don't say any more&#xD;
"Only to caution you to 'be careful of yourself, dear uncle."&#xD;
"Oh, I'm sturdy as an oak," asserted the good Qld fellow gaily,&#xD;
"and can bear more 'than half the nien with ten : years less upon&#xD;
their shoulders. Now, not another word, you foolish thing. Good&#xD;
night, good night!" and he fairly forced her' from the room.&#xD;
In less than five minutes Uncle Jacob completed his arrange-&#xD;
ments, and'left the house with Harry tnd the thee Servants. But&#xD;
although Isabel sought her chamber, she thought not of repose, for&#xD;
the fate of -the 'man. who had awakened so strange an interest&#xD;
in her heart, was yet unknown to her.      She felt herself&#xD;
drawn towards this stranger by, an impulf :she cud not re-&#xD;
sist, but she could not tell whence came this impulse ; she&#xD;
only knew 'that he had become most dear to her, and imagined&#xD;
that it -was' gratitude that aroused the' feeling,s She tried to&#xD;
reassure 'herself with Uncle Jacob's words, but could not, though&#xD;
she never allowed a thought of the possibility of Walters'&#xD;
having sustained a fatal:injury to cross her mind, She sat there,&#xD;
pale as'a statue, with her hands pressed firmly upon her bosom and&#xD;
listening eagerly to catch the slightest sound. Ten minutes had&#xD;

not yet elapsed since the departure of heruncle and his party, yet&#xD;
it appeared to her as.if as many hours had passed. The atmosphere.&#xD;
seemed dense and oppressive, and she threw open the shutters to,&#xD;
let in, abreath ot-purer air, and saw,standing upon the portico inim&#xD;
mediately before her, the miscreant Brently ! She staggered back.&#xD;
into a chair, almost 'dumh with amazement and terror, and the&#xD;
ruffian at once sprang into theechamber and seated himself near her.&#xD;
"Why," exclaimed the'villain, "really,.Belle, this complaisance&#xD;
on your part quite charming.  was-preparing to make forcible&#xD;
entry through that window, when, behold! you forestall my inten-&#xD;
tions rhythrowing it open'with your-own fair hands. And this is&#xD;
your 'ownimmaeulate chamber, too! Faith,.it's a luxurious one-a&#xD;
very proper one for the reception of -so true a lover as myself.&#xD;
Really, Belle, I'm charmed."&#xD;
Isabel's eyes flashed with:indignation, and, she forgot her help-&#xD;
less situations she answered:&#xD;
"Begone, detested wretch ! I have not words to express the&#xD;
loathing and contempt I feel for: you. Leave this apartment, nor&#xD;
dare contaminate itlonger with your presence.",&#xD;
"Very good, indeed; said the miscreant, witha low, sneering.&#xD;
laugh. "You do it capitally. However,'as time is precious, I must&#xD;
beg you to defer these =little ebullitions-for -some more. propitious&#xD;
moment. But be 'not alarmed, my sweet creature, inregard to this&#xD;
apartment. It is not here: I hope totconsummate the. happiness I&#xD;
now experience.  The home I provided for you years ago, has&#xD;
ever since been faithfully reserved, and now- that it is about to re-&#xD;
ceive you-"&#xD;
"Another word and I'll alarm the house," and Isabel took a&#xD;
step towards the door:&#xD;
"And I solemnly declare to you," asserted Brently, coolly, "that&#xD;
I will commit manslaughter, or womanslaughter3 as the case amay&#xD;
be, upon the first person that enters this room without my express&#xD;

but women remain,'and my companionsoutside would like nothing&#xD;
better than to kill, burn and destroy, as the saying is.' Alarm the&#xD;
house, my beauty, by 'all means.'&#xD;
An icy chill shot through Isabel's veins, but she felt 'it was a&#xD;
time when the forethought of a second wouli determine the for-&#xD;
tune of a life; and that her chances of escape, as well as the safety&#xD;
of the innocent young creature who slumbered unconsciously in an&#xD;
adjacent chamber, depended upon her gaining time  util her friends&#xD;
returned. She endeavored to subdue her feelings of repugnance,&#xD;
and to throw more gentleness into her tohe, but there was'still a&#xD;
deal of coldness in it when she asked---&#xD;
"What do you require of me?"&#xD;
"Since you have 'dropped inveetives," he replied; "I will an-&#xD;
swer you to the point. I am desirous of possessing you, for two&#xD;
cogent reasons. In the first place you are rich and I am poor--"&#xD;
"Name the sum you require," interrupted Isabel, "and you shall&#xD;
have it."&#xD;
"'What is the total value of your property," asked the miscreant.&#xD;
"That much I require."--.&#xD;
"Take it-take everything"-said Isabel gaspingly, "so you but&#xD;
leave me unmolested for the future!"&#xD;
"I have named my first reason," resumed Brently. "My second&#xD;
is, that as you twice bafRed mey I am piqued into taking advantage&#xD;
of my present power."&#xD;
"Will not my wealth content you ?" she asked, shuddering in-&#xD;
voluntarily.&#xD;
"No!" replied the villain, "I cannot make conditions.,- Will you&#xD;
go with me quietly, or shall I fire the house ? Decide quickly ; I&#xD;
have no- time to lose," and hecaught up a lamp,,with a threaten-&#xD;
ing air.&#xD;
"Forbear!t forbear 1" cried Isabel. "If I consent, will you pro-&#xD;
mise me not to molest any one you may find here?"&#xD;
"My 'business is with you, not them," he rel'lied. "X promise,&#xD;

"Your honor I" returned Isabel, bitterly. "Give Ine an hour for&#xD;
preparation, and I'll go with you."&#xD;
"Five minutes.will suffice-J'll help you," answered Brently,&#xD;
   ATht wardrobe contains your dresses, does it not? Let me select&#xD;
the handsomest-.so. Your fine linens, jewelry and the like, arein&#xD;
this bureau are they not? Aye, I thought- so. Don't rise- --I'll pack&#xD;
them up myself. Thgt bandbox, of course ontain a bonnt,We'll&#xD;
take the bonnet and leave the box, it would be troublesome to car-&#xD;

Well, silencegives consent of course.:I'll hundle them all together&#xD;
in this very rich cashmere shoulder-coverlet, and now, Belle, our&#xD;
preparations are complete, Let's make a start ofrit at once. Come!'?&#xD;
But at this moment, Dick thrust his head through the window,&#xD;
and said in a low, quick tone:&#xD;
"Hurry up, Jack, they're coming back, I think!"&#xD;
Isabel caught the words and her heart beathigh with ecstacy.&#xD;
"Aha !" she cried, " help is at hand! You are foiled, villain, you&#xD;
are foiled!"&#xD;
"Damnation!" exclaimed the miscreant savagely.. "But you've&#xD;
not.escaped me yet. Come, or I'll kill you where you stand!"-&#xD;
"I defy you, coward!" cried the noble woman. "Now I'm be-&#xD;
yond your power."  And she, rushed past, him to the window and&#xD;
was about to scream for help, when the inhuman monster, Dick,&#xD;
struck her-with a, club,sand she-fell insensible across the sill. -&#xD;
"You've killed her, fool," muttered Brently, "and spoiled every&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
"No, it was only a stunner," answered Dick;, cooly, "and it'll&#xD;
keep her mum along the road.&#xD;
Brently remarked that perhaps it was as well he did so, and or-&#xD;
dered him to. extinguish the- light, take, charge of the bundle, anTd&#xD;
to close the shutters carefully when he-,came tit, 'for fear," he&#xD;
continued jocosely, "some rascally housebreaker might enter the&#xD;

me from this place and I'll confess&#xD;
"Confess!" interrupted Uncle Jacob,'starting up. "What! Then&#xD;
you are guilty?"&#xD;
"No, no, no !" cried Isabel, wildly ; "before heaven I declare&#xD;
that I am innocent. But I cannot tell you hee. -Take me from this&#xD;
place-,-I stifle in it."&#xD;
"Hum!" muttered Brently, "false-hearted and fickle to the last.&#xD;
But you cannot deny your own words--you dare not"&#xD;
"Deny them!" exclaimed Uncle Jacob. "If he lies, say so, and&#xD;
fear him not, for he ii powerless now, and we are strong. Deny&#xD;
them, on the instant!"&#xD;
"I cannot," cried Isabel, "but not last night, no, no, 'twas not&#xD;
last night. Take me hence, and I'll tell you all. For your own&#xD;
sake-for mine-for my mother's, give me a private hearing."&#xD;
"Did you speak those words, and voluntarily?"&#xD;
"I did! I did! but hear me, father, I implore-.--~--"&#xD;
"Peace ! exclaimed the too sternly honest man, "peace, and hear&#xD;
me.- Between you and my own child, I never made distinction. As&#xD;
a sacred trust from my dying sister I received you, so with a fa-'&#xD;
ther's doting fondness I looked upon you both, and like young&#xD;
vines you twined about the heart that fostered and protected you.&#xD;
I thought you good and innocent, but I find you--it does not mat.&#xD;
ter what, for now we behold each other for the last time on earth!"&#xD;
"No, no! father, father   "&#xD;
"Go, Isabel, goI If you respect your mother's memory plunge&#xD;
no further into wickedness, but make your peace with Heaven&#xD;
while there is yet time."&#xD;
The inflexible old man turned towards the door, throwing her oft&#xD;
when she attempted to detain him.&#xD;
"Mother, mother," ried the bewildered boy, "what's the mat-&#xD;
ter?  Don't weep so, mother!&#xD;
And tears glistened in Walters' eyes as he said "Fear not,&#xD;
poor boy, her wrongs shall ere long be made apparent ; but come&#xD;

CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIRSTS&#xD;
t YA": )~iY iWY r.&#xD;
The figure of Caroline standing in the doorway opposed Uncle&#xD;
Jacob's exit.Y&#xD;
"What does this'mean ?'"she asked. "All grave faces here&#xD;
excepthis, when his should e overcast and yours all joyous!".&#xD;
Isabel ran to her eagerly and said, "disprove what this villain&#xD;
has asserted, or I anlost .forever."&#xD;
Has he dared to assert aught against you ?" asked Garoline.&#xD;
"If you can disprove it," interposed Uncle Jacob, "an old mnan'&#xD;
blessing ,shall be yours."&#xD;
Bi-ently'instantly cormprehended all, and-he silently cursed himni..&#xD;
self for allowing Caroline to ensnare him thus, yet he hoped to baf-=&#xD;
fle her again  'U  a             N&#xD;
"She will be a fair witness against me," he said, "inasmuch as&#xD;
she is a former mistress whom I cast ,off because she was a very&#xD;
fiend intemper,-and sought, -in a -drunken fit, to ro] and  murder me-.&#xD;
For -this she }swore that she would bring; me tp the gallows, no&#xD;
matter what means he ,'took, and for this end accused me of a rime&#xD;
:of wioh I was truly innocent. ,Bad .as I am, the charge was by&#xD;
Par too modstrods,.s they dimissedit;,for. she could not prove it.&#xD;
She isthe woiman-whoccarped{wof the boy and would have killed&#xD;
him in-coldj biood, had not a friend of nine torn him}fromiher grasp,&#xD;
and left him where he knew he would be er ed ;for."&#xD;

flcer; and Iwould:have restored the child had not-  "&#xD;
"Aha!" interrupted Brently. "You hear s ieconfesses being the&#xD;
cause of my arrest ,and Iappealto the officer whether she did not&#xD;
then again attempt to murder me'"&#xD;
. was kinder mie4 p," answered MrDi       in a cogdes-.&#xD;
cendin g tone, "for she sorter took you  the throttle and throwed&#xD;
,you under the  wehigle, whereas ou--.-"&#xD;
"To save-myself, I woundedlher," cried Brentl  "That was&#xD;
natural. I need say no more. If you deeim.wonuan,} who, for&#xD;
fifteen years, has almost daily perpetrated crimes, the worst among&#xD;
&#xD;
our gang would not have dared commit-to be capable of one. sin-&#xD;
gle action untinged by selfishness and second Jhought:; you are&#xD;
welcome to believe her."&#xD;
"We shall discuss that point hereafter," said Caroline, with a&#xD;
glance of withering enmity. "At present I merely wish to hear&#xD;
the charges against this lady, in order that I may refute them."&#xD;
"Then tell me how he came by her wedding ring,!,' asked Un-&#xD;
cle Jacobi&#xD;
"That I know not, but the presumption is that he stole it off her&#xD;
finger. Thieving is his trade."&#xD;
"Presumption ?" muttered Brently. "Presumption-is not refu-&#xD;
tation."&#xD;
"Uncle;," cried Isabel, "once more I assert my innocence, and&#xD;
call upon you to hear me."&#xD;
"Heaven knows how willingly I would believe it, but after your&#xD;
own admissions, what am I to think ?" asked Uncle Jacob., "He&#xD;
says you fled with him voluntarily; that you promised to be his,&#xD;
and becdie h;is,and although you tell me you' are innocent, you do&#xD;
not even attempt the denial of his accusations."&#xD;
"Then I'll deny them for her," exclaimed Caroline. "She, was&#xD;
dragged here by force in a stunned and ,senseless state, and when&#xD;
after her recovery; he returned, 'twas Ithat received him  in this&#xD;
chamber,,while she remained in yonder one ! You still look mere-&#xD;
dulous. Am I not believed?&#xD;
It would be, singular if you were," said Brently, "shef you&#xD;
deny what:she, the interested party, has already confessed&#xD;
"'Tis false ! naught had she to confess, cried Caroline. "But&#xD;
in order that your alimniations may at onde fall powerless,'I'll&#xD;
now divulge a secret which I hoped would go with me to the grave.&#xD;
Subtile as. you are, Jack, you have overreached yourself. You&#xD;
knew not when you first placed 'e inher serving to aid you in your&#xD;
designs,'that in early life we two had been as sisters. But five&#xD;
ears of wrotehedness had changed me greatly and she knew me&#xD;
not, yet my love for her remained the same, and I would have pe-&#xD;
rished sooner than see herharmed.. I saved her then and last night&#xD;
I shielded her again. Look, Jack, at tht abused old man. You&#xD;

and brought down to a level with the:vilest of her sex. Can any&#xD;
one suppose, degraded though I am, that-during tthe first hours ofi&#xD;
our meeting after the long and repentent years I've spent, I'd dare&#xD;
give utterance to a lie to deceive the kind, indulgenmai who was&#xD;
ink father?":&#xD;
All within the room, except Theodore and th  mpenetrable&#xD;
Eingby, started with surprise&#xD;
"I, your father!" exclaimed Uncle Jacob, doubtfully, for when he&#xD;
sawher lasts she was a younggay, emnentllvel gzri ure as an&#xD;
opening lily, and joyous as a bird. .N'ow, what was she. An out-&#xD;
cast, a self-despised wretch, a mere branded wreck. No wondet-&#xD;
tidedJacob doubted.&#xD;
"I was your daughter, but long ago that claim was forfeited. Do&#xD;
you remember' placing a jewelled ring upon my finger the day you&#xD;
left me at the seminary, and telling me 'twas my mother's gift ?&#xD;
See, it remains upon that finger still, but like me, its purity has&#xD;
faded,'the diamond hia been lost, and now'-tis worthless! There&#xD;
lies'the  an who robbed you of a daughter, and sent that daughter's&#xD;
mother mourning to the grave. There .lies the man who would&#xD;
steel another loved one from you and make her infamous and wretch-&#xD;
ed as he did me. -Credit his assertions if you will; t'would be a glo-&#xD;
rious triumph could he break her heart, as he did mine and my poor&#xD;
dead mothers."                               nadmpo&#xD;
"No, no," cried Unole Jacob, "my eyes are opened. I have&#xD;
wronged hei, and I -bow with humility and shame before her. Isa-&#xD;
bel, can you forgive my cruelty?"&#xD;
"First let us leave this place," she said, "and after I have ex-&#xD;
plained away the things which now seem stains upon me, I will&#xD;
forgive you, father, on condition that you receive back your erring&#xD;
but repentant daughter, Tbr she; has atoned for all by her genero-&#xD;
'sity to me."&#xD;
"Receive her !" exelaime4 Uncle Jacob. "I will provide for&#xD;
her, and place her above the reach of want ; but I never more can&#xD;
look upon her as a daughter."&#xD;
"Nor do Ihope for that," interposed Caroline, "or wish it. 'My&#xD;
term of years hay nearly slipped away ; and now that I feel life&#xD;
drawing to its close, I would not be the cause of shame to any&#xD;
one. All I ask is, that I may sometimes, be remembered as I was,&#xD;
ere ruin overtook rhe; and that my father will look upon my crimaes&#xD;
with a more lenient eye when he has heard I am no more. But&#xD;
with yo,"r she continued, turning to Brently, "I have not done as&#xD;
yet!"&#xD;
&#xD;
105&#xD;
&#xD;
"No,'-,heuanswered, "we have a long account to settle, an shall&#xD;
meet again.n&#xD;
"Twice! twice!" exclaimed his victim, "once at the bar of Just-&#xD;
ice, next at the scaffold's fodt ! I have sworn it, and will keep my&#xD;
oath ! Isabel, my cousin, you are saved-and, from this moment,&#xD;
will be secure, at least, from him. Father, we now meet for the&#xD;
last timeon' earth. Forget that ive been criminal, but remember&#xD;
who it was that made me so.  I would say more, but dare not-&#xD;
fareweil forever."&#xD;
"s ay, Stay  c tried the old man, "I forgive you, Caroline ; the&#xD;
past shall be forgotten; you shall be my daughter still!"&#xD;
.Butshe was gone.&#xD;
CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SECOND.&#xD;
Mr. Dingby's merry men, having disposed of the prisoners cap..&#xD;
tured below, now came upstairs to assist in the removal of Brent-&#xD;
ly. The ruffian's last expedient had failed.&#xD;
A short time after this, a delicious reunion took place at the lit-&#xD;
tle rural paradise above the road, and all, save Uncle Jacob, seem-&#xD;
ed gay and happy, For he was oppressed by a double care, the&#xD;
disgrace of his lost daughter, and the shame of having doubted the&#xD;
honor of his niece. Yet he was anxious to hide his .feelings, and&#xD;
so endeavored to look cheerful and happy too, and would break&#xD;
suddenly into fits of laughter, mostly at times when nothing what-&#xD;
ever had occurred to laugh at. Then he would look as a man al-&#xD;
ways does, after attempting to do something to amuse a company,&#xD;
and making an awkward mess of it. Finally, unable to endure this&#xD;
self-torture longer, he declared by way of an excuse to get away,&#xD;
that he must really show Theodore the grounds ; and Isabel hav-&#xD;
ing given her consent, the elderly gentleman grasped the youthful&#xD;
gentlemIan's hand, and fairly dragged him from the room. After&#xD;
which, Isabel and Walters, Egeria and Harry, maintained a general&#xD;
conversation for a while, but It, soon flagged for lack .of interest.&#xD;
Upon which Egeria declared that this ways ver stupidd, and that&#xD;
she believed she would go' help father to  ow Theodore the&#xD;
grounds and Harry -said that he would be delighted to help her to&#xD;

the little trellis bower, which was the. scene of the interesting&#xD;
conversation recorded in our eifteenth chapter, and seated them-&#xD;
selvewithin it.&#xD;
Having    posed this bit of dupliity, we will re-enter the draw-&#xD;
ing-room, and see-Walters kneeling at the feet of Isabel!&#xD;
 "Ah,;sabel,",he said, "the love 1' bore for you in days gone by,&#xD;
through want and..avery, through dangers, through weal and woe,&#xD;
has been the foremost-feeling of my heart: With my years it has&#xD;
increased, with each effort to efface it from my memory it has tak-&#xD;
en firmer hold, and the dreams of youth have become the life-&#xD;
hopes of my maturer years. Send me not forth again a lonely&#xD;
wanderer to perish among strangers, but let me look upon you in&#xD;
that blessed light that cheered me in my dreams, and.gi-ant me a&#xD;
realization of the entrancing vision. Be mine, Isabel, as you once&#xD;
promised, and let us both forget that years of misery have inter-&#xD;
vened between that day and this."&#xD;
"As I once promised," she repeated in a trembling tone.&#xD;
"Yes, Isabel. Have you forgotten the playmate of your child-&#xD;
iood, who- grew up with you,-and each day learned to love you&#xD;
siore and more ? Have you forgotten how we used to ramble to-.&#xD;
gether through the valleys and over, the hills around- our native&#xD;
glace, and hio  we vowed that we would never separate? Have&#xD;
y6u forgotten 'how, spite of these vows, you allowed yourself to be.-&#xD;
come estranged from me, and cast me off to marry a man you did&#xD;
not love."&#xD;
"Nay, do not reproach meyfor I have suffered deeply for my&#xD;
faults, and have endeavored to atone for them. Oh, George, forget&#xD;
the inconstancy which. causedaay own heart, as well as yours, so&#xD;
eeia  p     nd if till now I have not fully recognized you, as-&#xD;

lived in ybiir thoughts as Arlinghain; so call me still, for to possess&#xD;
your love :would be to possess the greatest wealth the world coul&#xD;
temp t 'de ith." '&#xD;
George,. loved you dearly 'when' 1eG 't seemedd to care for&#xD;
you. I love youaw; heaven and my own heart alone can tell how&#xD;
'eish the remembrance of the past, for now a sun goes up&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
CONCLUSION.&#xD;
&#xD;
107&#xD;
&#xD;
that will eradiate the future, and never set again. Oh, transport&#xD;
At -last, dear Isabel, Ican call youlmine:"p&#xD;
"No, George, for the very reason that Hove you thus, I must&#xD;
nt be your wife. You bear an untarnished name, and I a blacken-&#xD;
,  one. .I have been accused-most wrongfullyut )s true-yet I&#xD;
have been -dishonored by that very accusation;, and therefore will&#xD;
not link my fate with yours to hide my tarnishedfamne beneath the&#xD;
cloak of:wedlock."&#xD;
"Your innocence has been already proved. Twas ever clear to&#xD;
me, and now 'tis clear to all."&#xD;
"Think you so ? And, could you wed me as I am, without one&#xD;
doubt, without one feeling of suspicion?"&#xD;
"Without a doubt-without suspicion! Yes, Isabel, for Ihaveno&#xD;
do4ibt, and could niot have, and were all the people of the world&#xD;
combined tocharge you with dishonor, a simple derjial from your&#xD;
lips would far outweigh their calumnies.&#xD;
"Then, George, I.will be yours. I'll prove myself deserving of&#xD;
your love, and by my unswerving fidelity in the future  amo&#xD;
atone for my fickleness in the past."                 amply&#xD;
Then, for the first time since childhood, their arms encircled etch&#xD;
other, and their lips met, and the bliss of that moment drove Care&#xD;
forever from their presence,&#xD;
And thus it was that the True Heart whom for his poverty, in earl&#xD;
life, she had cast off and sent wandering about the world, at len t&#xD;
reached that elysian goal, to which, throughout his life, his bright-&#xD;
est wishes tended. And the promise that she made was verified,&#xD;
for she indeed proved worthy of his love,&#xD;
