MELUKE.&#xD;
&#xD;
8                                THE MA&#xD;
of youth were ever in training at the chieftain's&#xD;
kiosk, where most of then soon forgot their na-&#xD;
tive Circassian or Albanianhomes. - There, want&#xD;
had been their portion until their relatives sold&#xD;
them to the slave-trader. But if they possessed&#xD;
sufficient intelligence and manly beauty to tempt&#xD;
the Mameluke purveyor, they at once became&#xD;
the favored youth ofEgypt. French and ltalian&#xD;
instructors stored their -minds, while veterans&#xD;
taught them how to manage Arabian steeds, to&#xD;
poise the lance, and to wield the scimitar with&#xD;
deadly skill. And, as a stimulus to exertion, of&#xD;
body and of mind, each one knew that when&#xD;
death or old age caused a vacancy in the band&#xD;
of leaders, the best qualified slave was selected&#xD;
to fill it. Rich amor,, fis, horses, sq4 1lkthat-&#xD;
a follower of the Pto hetcan deqit, were thek e-&#xD;
forth his.&#xD;
Our story commences with the promotion of&#xD;
one of these Mameluke cadets, named Osmanli.&#xD;
He had been purchased when young, much to&#xD;
the surprise of the slave-dealer, who could not-&#xD;
imagine that such a young stripling would ever&#xD;
make an athletic warrior. In this opinion his&#xD;
purchaser secretly concurred, but a peculiar&#xD;
mark, tattooed in blue characters upon the b Yqp&#xD;
arm, touched the Mameluke's heart. Hazarding&#xD;
his reputation as a knowing purchaser, he sent&#xD;
the lad up to Cairo, and soon (aw with great&#xD;
satisfaction, that those who jested at his judg-&#xD;
ment would be deceived. Ere he had attained&#xD;
6y'sixteenth year,.young Osmanli was undoubt-&#xD;
doly 'te first among the cadets.  He spoke&#xD;
Feich and Italian with fluency, had read the,&#xD;
Koran, and was a skillful engineer. And, while&#xD;
his naturally fmXte intellect was enriched far in.&#xD;
adVance of his comrades, his bodily.powers had&#xD;
so maturedthat he excelled them in all athletic&#xD;
sports andarlike exercises. Eminently hand-&#xD;
somi, as though a sculptor had moulded his&#xD;
formnhe displayed in every feature a spirit.9f the&#xD;
manliest daring anid valor. Thick,glossy blacl;&#xD;
hair iaved gracefUy over his noble brow, for,&#xD;
the" melukes did not shave their heads (like&#xD;
th'ei-Noslems) until they had.made a pilgrim-&#xD;
age to Mecca.    is bright blue eyes sparkled&#xD;
with vigorousthought, aId his countenance, al-&#xD;
though o'ercast by a hue,of deep,settled thogt-&#xD;
fulness, wore a .epial sincerity of expression,&#xD;
whiceould notfailto inspire confidence.&#xD;
&amp;amp;everthefess, Qamani .was enfranchised and-&#xD;
promoted without me usual ceremonies and, re-&#xD;
jQicings. Moui-ad,]ey sentihim, with his,4frnan,&#xD;
or commission,.a gorgous suit of chain armor,&#xD;
&#xD;
on whose bright steel links were enamelled quaint&#xD;
devices in virgin gold. His old protector, whose&#xD;
cheek flashed with proud delight as he gazed on&#xD;
the chivalric form  of his once deprecated pur-&#xD;
chase, sent him a fleet Arabian courser, and his'&#xD;
comrades, *ho loved and respected him, joined&#xD;
their scanty funds for the purchase of a scimitar&#xD;
with which a spider-web or a steel casque could&#xD;
be severed-so keen and yet so staunch was its&#xD;
wavy blade. Yet, there was no solemn investi-&#xD;
ture of arms in the mosque. No mimic warfare&#xD;
honored the admission of the favored recruit.&#xD;
The Iiosk of the Bey did not, as was the custom,&#xD;
resound with warlike songs, nor did the warriors,&#xD;
as they enjoyed their pipes and coffee, witness,&#xD;
the ,yoluptuous dance pfthe Almeh girls, to the&#xD;
mio ofthe tambour and'the aestanets. More&#xD;
'sei-los matters occupied the thoughts'of all.&#xD;
Strangers had invaded the land!I A messen-&#xD;
ger from Alexandria had brought word, about a&#xD;
fortnight previous, that a squadron had cast an-&#xD;
chor in the-bay of that city. The next day, tid-&#xD;
ings came that an army, landing on the beach,&#xD;
had soon effected an entrance through the ruin-&#xD;
ous city walls, and were occupying the once&#xD;
prou capital of Cleopatra.&#xD;
To the Mamelukes, who regarded themselves&#xD;
as invincible lords of the Nile valley, this intelli-&#xD;
geuce -seemed at first incredible. But it was&#xD;
soon confirmed, and their surprise was converted&#xD;
into, rage when they received copies of procla-&#xD;
:tatiols conciliating the harmlessjigyptians by&#xD;
fIlttering their animosity against their warlike&#xD;
despots. "Know ye faitilful," said oneof those&#xD;
addresses, "that the French, who have destroyed&#xD;
the vassal power, are the allies of the Sultan and&#xD;
the enemies of his enemies. "They, come not to&#xD;
wage war against true Mussulmen, but against&#xD;
revolting despots. Thrice.1lappy shall theybe&#xD;
who assist us-blest in their fortune and'inheri-&#xD;
tance; bul woe to all who arm in defence of the&#xD;
Maielukes, and fight against us. For them&#xD;
there is neither recompense nor hope. It is de-&#xD;
creed, that they shall perish." And to all these&#xD;
proclamations there was signed "Bonaparte."&#xD;
Nlo learned~sheik at Cairo had ever heard of that&#xD;
nanme among those distinguished by hereditary,&#xD;
rank in Europe. B1ut the Italian professor who&#xD;
had instructed, the cadets, told them it was a&#xD;
Corsican soldier, who had carved with his good&#xD;
sword. a proud reputation, and who had con-&#xD;
quered'the land 9f the Caesars.&#xD;
Roused, and aware that it was a contest of ex-&#xD;
termiw'ation, oI one side or the other, the Mame-&#xD;

ing that the French were advancing up the river:,&#xD;
Mourad Bey resolved to-make:a desperate stad&#xD;
at his head-quarters, where, if he conquered, he&#xD;
could annihilate his surviving opponents ete&#xD;
they could retreat to the seashore, Here all his&#xD;
forces were concentrated, and many a warlike&#xD;
tribe of Arabs cathe -in from the shores ofithe&#xD;
Red Sea, -proud to fight -with theMamelkes,'&#xD;
and eager to aid in extirpating the runbeliev-&#xD;
ing dogs- that sought to extendI their dominiodn&#xD;
over the faithful followers of Mahomet. The&#xD;
sacred green banner was ,unfurled 'before'Mon-&#xD;
rad. Bey's kiosk, defendedd by -a smallbattery,&#xD;
whileon either side were entrenehments, reach-&#xD;
ingon-the one hand to the riverbaNwk, and en'o&#xD;
the other to 'the very foundations 'of the great&#xD;
Pyramid.&#xD;
On the vast plain in front of this line'offorti-&#xD;
fications, the Moslem'host .arryed. Itself, on the&#xD;
morning of July 21a, 1798, for the-decigitetom.&#xD;
bat.  The Mamelukes,' arrayed in light -yet!&#xD;
highly tempered armor, and bearingthe choicest&#xD;
weapons manufactured at Damascus, appeared.&#xD;
invincibleL Arabs, mounted on their desert&#xD;
steeds, moved in bodies like clouds of dustbefortt&#xD;
the north wind, and hordes of Nubians,4rmed&#xD;
with spears and shields; sangthefr discraait&#xD;
war-songs. It was a gallanthost, well alculated,&#xD;
to inspire the hearts of its leader withighhopes,'&#xD;
and to make him  certain of victory ,over'the&#xD;
comparatively feeble columns of the' French&#xD;
troops just coming in sight, winding, like ana-&#xD;
condas, over the sandy plain.'&#xD;
The sounds of the Tartar drums and the clang-&#xD;
ing cymbals; the neighing of the horses and the&#xD;
clash of arms, had attracted all the inmates of&#xD;
the kiosk, with a solitary exception, to places&#xD;
where they could gaze upon the proud array of&#xD;
the champions of their faith. But the inmate of&#xD;
one richly-furnished saloon' (the latticed windows&#xD;
of which denoted that it was a portion of the&#xD;
king's harem) knelt in prayer, unconscious of&#xD;
the animated scene without. Herstrongly marked&#xD;
countenance had the olive tinge peculiar to the&#xD;
Jewish race, but her complexion was neverthe-&#xD;
less clear .and transparent. Long, silken eye-&#xD;
lashes, over-arched by thick raven brows, added&#xD;
to the lustre of her full, clear orbs, which shone&#xD;
through her tears as the sun beams through an&#xD;
April cloud. Golden coins were strung on the&#xD;
braids of her long, jetty tresses, and on the top&#xD;
&#xD;
f -her-lassically shaped heid was a scarlet a&#xD;
trimmed with g6ld and gems. A    ight flg    '&#xD;
yellow silk tunic Was disclosed by ab obi,olWd&#xD;
embroidered erimson 4 elvet jacket, in th6- fr'&#xD;
lined sleeves of which nestled arrs'like alabas'M'&#xD;
And' bound around the delicate waist, wAs ~a&#xD;
valtible cashmere scarf, Which served asa girdle&#xD;
to sustain"flowing  ellow silk tirwsers, gathered'&#xD;
at theankles, where their heavy folds diciose'd&#xD;
tiry bare feet, partially encased in richly wrdught&#xD;
slippers.&#xD;
Judith Fezenzac, for such was the inaiddin's&#xD;
name, was the only child of a eAvlthy" Je*nh&#xD;
iretechant at Smyrna, *ho had' sent her to E'-&#xD;
rope to receive a thorough- edtafon. She em-&#xD;
parked-for Genoa in an Italiaifnelingda, but-ta&#xD;
aptitred'by an EgyptiAn cotsair, and expog5el&#xD;
for sale in the slave-tnarket at Alexandria. I-r'&#xD;
hat-riis' attracted the attention of the!Nubin&#xD;
purveyor for the lley'ihareni,-Who immediately&#xD;
purchased-her, ana seht'heir to his sisterr." 'B t&#xD;
'*hile on her passage up the Nile, A messetiger'&#xD;
passed on the bank witli-e'vs of the French'in-&#xD;
vasion, and when she arrived at Cairo, Modrfi&#xD;
intent on defending his power,'did not eVea&#xD;
to glance at the new exotic brought to gracehiiA&#xD;
seraglio. Meanwhile'*lkdith suffered the agony&#xD;
fof suspense, and the fear of'a degradation worse&#xD;
that'death, with a-firm reliatee that the:Gadf&#xD;
Israel, oi4saac, and of Jacob, would succor-her&#xD;
in the hbur of iieed.&#xD;
And n#o, uniiluftiated with'the cause of the&#xD;
'warlike preparations without, and unihtereitM&#xD;
by the martial display, she poured forth her soul&#xD;
in prayer. A captive, she supplicated the God&#xD;
of her fathers for deliverance, even as he deliv-&#xD;
ered them, when, centuries before, they were in&#xD;
bondage on the same soil. Acknowledging his&#xD;
mighty power, that guideth the hosts of heaven&#xD;
in their glory, and yet protects the sparrow's&#xD;
tender brood, she preyed that he might stretch.,-&#xD;
forth his right arm, and release her from the op.&#xD;
pressor. Then, with a rich, sonorous voice, she&#xD;
began to chant a psalm of David, each note&#xD;
sparkling in its outward gush, with the clearness&#xD;
and brilliancy of the diamond.&#xD;
The door was opened suddenly, and Judith,&#xD;
springing to her feet, instinctively carried her&#xD;
right hand to the folds of her girdle. A dagger&#xD;
was there concealed, which she had found in her&#xD;
room at Alexandria, and she had so nerved her -&#xD;
heart, that she felt ready to sacrifice her life,&#xD;
rather than to suffer dishonor.&#xD;
Osmanli, for he was the intruder, entered he&#xD;

room, his prepo~sqsaipgexterior set off by his,&#xD;
gorgeos suit- of fe bible chain armor. Judith,&#xD;
gasd at him for an instant. with an expression.&#xD;
ofanxiety and doubt, but the kindness stamped&#xD;
upon his open countenance apparently relieved&#xD;
her .fega,  crossing her alabaster arms upon&#xD;
her throbbing chest, she bowed reverentially, and&#xD;
then cast an imploring glance of resignation.&#xD;
"Is it the-daughter.of Mordecai Fezenzac "&#xD;
he inquired, in a rich, musical voice, and in pure,&#xD;
French.&#xD;
"I-am that old man's child," was the reply,&#xD;
in he same tongue.&#xD;
"Allah be praised I Late last night Ireceived,&#xD;
from Alexandria, a sign and a token that you-&#xD;
th  ebild of a, brother-wpre-here in bondage.&#xD;
LUeJily, the hey. has taken his seraglio guard to&#xD;

to, enter the sacredespot without being observed.&#xD;
Every one is without, or upon the terraced roof,&#xD;
andnow, gentle maiden, escape from the nest&#xD;
ere the eagle returns."&#xD;
"The God of Israel be praised !" ejaculated&#xD;
Judith.&#xD;
Then, her woman'a heart dictated prudence,&#xD;
andshe asked:,&#xD;
",Where wilJ you take me '"&#xD;
As she put the question, in a - tone which im-&#xD;
plied doubt, Osmanli noticed a ring of quaint&#xD;
device on one of -her taperlfingers. Hastily strip-&#xD;
ping up the sleeve of his coat of mail, and baring&#xD;
his left arm, be showed her a peculiar emblem,&#xD;
intlibly marked,.&#xD;
&#xD;
* 2"See/ said he ,"the same emblem, that is&#xD;
wroughiupon your ring. Your father, although&#xD;
I know him not, is my brother, and I am bound&#xD;
to protectyou."&#xD;
Judith's eyes flashed with joyful confidence,&#xD;
and she replied in a gladsome-tone;&#xD;
"I have often seen that mystical sign, and&#xD;
never have I known it associated with evil.&#xD;
Command, and I will obey."&#xD;
"Hasten, then," said the Mameluke, "and I&#xD;
will place you in a safe retreat, once used as a&#xD;
refugeby .the priests of Isis."&#xD;
Putting on a large mantle, and throwing a&#xD;
thick veil over her head, Judith intimated that&#xD;
she was ready, and they left the kiosk., Hastily&#xD;
traversing the garden, ,they reached a ruined&#xD;
pile, on the north side of which Osmanli&#xD;
pushed against a large stone. To the great as-&#xD;
tonishment of Judith, it revolved, and she was&#xD;
ushered into an obscure passage. Closing the&#xD;
massive door behind them, and then opening&#xD;
another, equally hidden, Osmanli handed Judith&#xD;
into a vaulted apartment, lighted from above.&#xD;
It was well supplied with the conveniences of&#xD;
life, and a table *as covered with food.&#xD;
"Here," he remarked, "I must leave ypu,&#xD;
although 1 hope soon to return. Even if I do&#xD;
not, another will see you restored to your father,&#xD;
Farewell.",&#xD;
Before Judith could recover from her aston-&#xD;
ishment her preserver was gone, and as the outer&#xD;
door closed after him, the roar of artillery shook&#xD;
the very earth,      I&#xD;

CHAPTER 1L&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BATTLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
VICrotY and glory. The ancient chivalry&#xD;
of France, who followed the oriflamb under&#xD;
Bayard and Duqueschir, were not more infatua,&#xD;
ted in their pursuit of these martial phantoms,&#xD;
than was every man of the French army in&#xD;
Egypt. And now, as they saw the Mameluke'&#xD;
forces drawn up in hostile array, their brave&#xD;
hearts echoed each defiant beat on their spirit-&#xD;
stirring drums. On they moved, with erect&#xD;
bearing, firm tramp, determined eye) and corp-&#xD;
pressed lip, eager for the hazards of adventurous&#xD;
action, and submissive to the commands of their&#xD;
adored leader, whose star had never paled upon&#xD;
the field of battle. This fixed devotion, mani-&#xD;
fested by shouts of 1 Long live Bonapartc",&#xD;
flushed the young general's sallow face with en-&#xD;
thusiasm, and he glanced. with exultant pride&#xD;
over his serried bands. His perception quick-&#xD;
ened, and his iron nerves strengthened, as he&#xD;
rode through the ranks of the different brigades,&#xD;
stimulating his well-tried veterans. "' Consider,"&#xD;
said he, pointing to the Pyramids, "that from&#xD;
the summits of yonder ,monuments, forty centu-&#xD;
ries survey your conduct. Act like heroes 1"&#xD;
inspired by this matchless idea,the French&#xD;
troops advanced at quick time to the attack,&#xD;
formed into five ,large squares.. When advane-&#xD;
ing, the sides of these squares marched " by the,&#xD;
Sank,* but at th  word "halt;" all face out-,&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ward, and thus formed an impregnable hedge,&#xD;
enclosing the artillery and the general officers.&#xD;
Onward they -moved, like so many torrents of&#xD;
glistening bayonets, and waving plumes, And&#xD;
flashing sabres, while over the, midst of each&#xD;
phalanx floated the brilliant tri-colored Alag, that&#xD;
palladium of republican victory.&#xD;
At length, raising their war-ory of." Allah-el-&#xD;
Allah !" the Mamelukes came charging across&#xD;
the plain, which resounded beneath the thunder&#xD;
of their horses' hoofs. .Brilliant and valiant as&#xD;
was the onset, it did not intimidate the French,&#xD;
who received their assailants at the bayonet's&#xD;
point, with a murderous fire.' The sun, which&#xD;
had glistened on the polished arms and accou.&#xD;
trements on both sides, was soon obscured bythe&#xD;
smoke which poured 'forth, in circling wreisths&#xD;
from cannon, muskets, and pistols, to hang in&#xD;
heavy clouds over a deadly storm of iron hail&#xD;
and leaden sleet. In vain.did the Mamelukes&#xD;
rush at full gallop against the French squares.&#xD;
In vain did they wheel their Arabian steeds,&#xD;
and endeavor to rein them backward through&#xD;
the serried pnks of bristling bayonets. Is vain.&#xD;
when they grew frantic with despair, di4 they&#xD;
hurl their pistols and their yataghs s int the&#xD;
faces of the French, or, when their horse. ,wer.&#xD;

THE MAMELUKE.&#xD;
&#xD;
discipline of the French was not to be shaken,&#xD;
even by the war-bronzed children of the desert.&#xD;
Band after band, advancing in solid phalanx,&#xD;
would recoil, staggering before the fiery dis-&#xD;
charges, like some sturdy ship cast against break-&#xD;
ers, but return again and again.to the attack,&#xD;
until the warriors, with their noble chargers,&#xD;
sank like frail shallops cast upon a rocky coast.&#xD;
Mourad Bey, his -white charger covered with&#xD;
foam and spotted with gore, was ever where the&#xD;
fight raged hottest. One moment, he would&#xD;
urge a squadron to advance, in the name of the&#xD;
Prophet, and destroy the unbelievers-and when,&#xD;
as was always the case, they fell back, he would&#xD;
check their retreat, as -if determined not to sub-,&#xD;
mit, but to seize victory from the averted hand&#xD;
of destiny. Dauntless as an uncaged eagle, his&#xD;
eye was clear,,and his manner calm, even when&#xD;
bullets hailed about him, but neither his example&#xD;
nor the impetuous bravery of his followers could&#xD;
make any impression against the French squares.&#xD;
At this disastrous stage of the conflict, Mburad&#xD;
determined to withdraw his forces up the river.&#xD;
Calling an attendant spahi to his side, he or-&#xD;
dered him to summon Oimanli, who had been,&#xD;

and dispirited, had given the order to charge,&#xD;
and Mourad, maddened with rage and mortifi-&#xD;
cation, saw his followers precipitately retreating.&#xD;
Panic-struck and disorganized, the Mamelukes&#xD;
sought to escape before the billow of steel which&#xD;
now swept across the plain, with murderous im-&#xD;
petuosity. There remained behind a sea of blood&#xD;
and slaughter,-on which drifted standards and&#xD;
arms, and which was agitated with the convul-&#xD;
sive, death-like gasp of the unstilled waves after&#xD;
an ocean-tempest.&#xD;
Osmanli had not participated in the contest,&#xD;
for he had felt it his duty to inform a brother of.&#xD;
the "mystic tie" where Judith was concealed.&#xD;
When, at last, he reached the spot where he had&#xD;
been posted, he found nothing but the corpses of&#xD;
several comrades, mingled with those of their'&#xD;
opponents. But the survivors-both the pursued&#xD;
and the pursuers-had moved on up the river,&#xD;
and he lost no time in following them, guided&#xD;
by the noise of the conflict. Hoping to force his.&#xD;
way through the French, and, to rejoin his-leader,&#xD;
he took a circuitous route, which led him through&#xD;
a small village. A garden wall barred his pro-&#xD;
gress, but his steed cleared it at a bound, and&#xD;
the Mameluke found himself by the side of two&#xD;
Frenchmen.&#xD;
One of these, who wore a sergeant's -unifOrm,&#xD;
no :sooner saw -Osmanli suddenly-appear, thAn&#xD;
he wok to his heels. But, the other, who *as&#xD;
earnestly examining a map, evinced no fear. Of,&#xD;
slight figure,and rather under the-usuastgture,&#xD;
there was nevertheless a quiet consciousness of&#xD;
powernanifested in his -,appearance,-nor did his&#xD;
unadorned gray unifortn detract the dignity of&#xD;

ject of their solicitude unscathed, there burst&#xD;
from. their throats shout of "Long live Bona-&#xD;
parte '' -Jt was repeated along.the whole French&#xD;
line, And Osmanli now knew that his brother&#xD;
wasino less a personage than the leader of the&#xD;
French forces.&#xD;
"Flints and hammers," growled a veteran&#xD;
sergeant-major. of grenadiers, upon whose coat&#xD;
sleeves were a dozen badges of good service,&#xD;
"Flints and hammers, my general,. there just&#xD;
came -a sergeant to the front, at double-quick&#xD;
time, crying that you were cagtured-perhaps&#xD;
killed. Million bombs, we left the eneny to&#xD;
tak3 care of themselves, and came to the rescue,&#xD;
You are unharmed-so much the better. But&#xD;
why are you thus without an escort, and on&#xD;
foot ?"&#xD;
"Thanks, thanks, my braves. My horse was&#xD;
lamed by chance shot, and while my orderly&#xD;
went to the rear for another, I came in here to&#xD;
examine my map, that I' might see where we&#xD;
could drive these infuriated* demons. As for&#xD;
sergeant-major Sauterre-"&#xD;
" Present !" said the veteran.&#xD;
"Ay," continued Bonaparte, "ever present in&#xD;
the hour of danger. And now, old grumbler,&#xD;
look after my Mameluke friend here, and bring&#xD;
him to me after evening parade."&#xD;
"Flints and hammers! Have you made a&#xD;
prisoner ?"&#xD;
"No! I found a brother, and as such I vouch&#xD;
for him."&#xD;
The defiant look with which the veteran had&#xD;
regarded Osmanli softened down into a credulous&#xD;
expression, but.his doubts were soon'removed.&#xD;
"Brothers," said Osmanli, in good French,&#xD;
"I have done my duty-can I not rejoin my&#xD;
chieftain ?"&#xD;
"Not:now," replied Bonaparte. "You would&#xD;
but rush into the very jaws of death. Besides, I&#xD;
must borrow your horse. This evening, when&#xD;
all is quiet, you can go if you wishh' Till then,&#xD;
good-by."&#xD;
Mounting Osmanli's charger, Bonaparte gal-&#xD;
loped to the front, where his presence animated&#xD;
the French with renewed ardor. The Mame-&#xD;
lukes, completely routed, fled at random, and&#xD;
strove for individual preservation. Mourad Bey&#xD;
was'only saved by the strength and speed of his&#xD;
horse, and in less than four hours after the first&#xD;
shot was fired, his forces were dispersed, and his&#xD;
entrenchments were occupied by the French.&#xD;
The Mussulmen who had gazed upon the bloody&#xD;
&#xD;
'At&#xD;
Ii&#xD;
&#xD;
scene from the minarets and the lofty citadel9f&#xD;
Cairo, were so-strongly impressed-by the dread-&#xD;
ful havoc made by the fiery phalanxes before&#xD;
which Mourad's hitherto invincible legions had&#xD;
quailed, that they named Bonaparte "El Sooltan&#xD;
Keber," the "Sultan of lVire."&#xD;
The bugles now sounded a "recall," and the&#xD;
victorious . troops were ordered to 'ivouac.&#xD;
Camp-fires were kindled, and the Pyramids soon,&#xD;
echoed back patriotic songs, the familiar notes&#xD;
of which, ri&amp;amp;b with pleasing remembrances,&#xD;
cheered the.wounded in their ambulances, and&#xD;
softened the pangs of many a dying veteraa.&#xD;
Then, again the drams beat-to arms, and again&#xD;
the long line was formed in martial, array, a&#xD;
simple "close up" filling all, the death gaps. It&#xD;
was the evening parade, and just as the-red orb&#xD;
of day-sank into the molten sands of (he desert,,&#xD;
Bonaparte rode along the line. His numerous&#xD;
staff-officers were resplendent with gold lace and&#xD;
rich embroidery, but the general wore the small&#xD;
cocked hat, and the simple gray coat, in which&#xD;
he first won his soldiers' hearts, and which, in&#xD;
their eyes, were associated with victory. After&#xD;
the review, the troops were formed in a hollow&#xD;
square, that Bonaparte, as was his wont, might&#xD;
address them. He spoke, and such was the si-&#xD;
lence in the ranks; that every file-closer heard his&#xD;
clear voice.&#xD;
"Soldiers !" he said. " I thank you from my&#xD;
heart, for you have more than sustained your&#xD;
reputation. Five years ago, the independence&#xD;
of the French people was threatened; but the&#xD;
capture of Toulon was the presage of ruin to&#xD;
our enemies. A year afterwards you defeated&#xD;
the Austrians at Dego. In the -following year,&#xD;
you were fighting upon the summits of the Alps.&#xD;
Two years ago you were contending beneath the&#xD;
walls of Mantua, and achieved the celebrated&#xD;
victory of St. George. Last year, you were at&#xD;
the sources of the Drave on your return from&#xD;
Germany; Who yould then have ventured to&#xD;
predict, that to day you should be on the banks&#xD;
of the Nile, in the centre of the ancient continent !&#xD;
From th'e Britons, renowned in arts and com-&#xD;
merce, to the ferocious Arab of the desert, you&#xD;
fix the attention of mankind. Your destiny is&#xD;
noble, because-you are worthy of your achieve-&#xD;
ments and of the reputation you have acquired.&#xD;
You will die with honor like the unburied brave&#xD;
around us, whose names I shall have inscribed&#xD;
on yonder Pyramid, or you will return to your&#xD;
country, covered with laurels, and exciting the&#xD;
admiration of all nations."&#xD;

&#xD;
Enthusiastic shouts hailed this eloquent ha-&#xD;
rangue; and the soldiers, leaving their ranks,&#xD;
thronged around their idolized leader, who thus&#xD;
won their affectioils. After the review, he estab-&#xD;
lished his quarters in the kiosk of Motrad Bey,&#xD;
and lost no time in sending for Osmanli. The&#xD;
young Mameluke,confused by the startling events&#xD;
of the day, and looking upon'the chief mover as&#xD;
little short of a divinity, was awe-struck as he&#xD;
entered the general's presence. -'But Bonaparte,&#xD;
with kind sympathy, soon made him feel that as&#xD;
brothers they were equal, and then he asked&#xD;
him to name some boon.'&#xD;
"For myself," said'Osmanli, " have nothing&#xD;
to ask. I but performed my duty. I am in&#xD;
your hands. Yet for another I ask protection.&#xD;
A Jewish maiden, who is the daughter of a&#xD;
brother, was yesterday a prisoner in the kiosk.&#xD;
It was my good fortune to rescue he'in the con-&#xD;
fusion which preceded the combat, and she is&#xD;
now concealed in yonder ruin. Deal with her,&#xD;
&#xD;
mighty lord, as the child of our brother,'who Is&#xD;
in peril."&#xD;
Sauterre immediately received orders' to accom-&#xD;
pany Osmanli with a file of men, and escort Ju-&#xD;
dith to the. kiosk.' Hour after hour, entombed&#xD;
in the ruin, had she listened with anguish to the&#xD;
noise of the battle, a thousand fears tormenting&#xD;
her brain, and when Osmanli again entered the&#xD;
tomb, she uttered a shriek of joy, and then sank&#xD;
senseless.&#xD;
"Million bombs," grumbled Sauterre. "She&#xD;
doesn't know that our general has sent for her."&#xD;
Recovering, and assured of protection, Judith&#xD;
returned to the kiosk, and met with a kind re-&#xD;
ception, Bonaparte assuring her that he would&#xD;
soon restore her to her father. That night she&#xD;
again occupied her splendid apartment in the&#xD;
harem, with a joyful sense of freedom from that&#xD;
degradation which had before made its luxuries&#xD;
hateful and its beauties odious,&#xD;

&#xD;
Titm army commanded by General Bonaparte&#xD;
had embarked with such secrecy, that when the&#xD;
English government learned its departure, it had&#xD;
not the slightest degree of the destination of the&#xD;
hostile armament. : Great, therefore, was the&#xD;
excitement in London, when intelligence was&#xD;
received by a trading vessel that the conquerorr&#xD;
of Italy " had captured Malta, on his'way to Al-&#xD;
exandria. He was undoubtedly bent upon the&#xD;
conquest of Egypt, "the theatre," to use his own&#xD;
words, of "mighty empires, where all the great&#xD;
revolutions of the earth had arisen, where mind&#xD;
had its birth, and all religions their cradle, and&#xD;
where six hundred millions of men still had a&#xD;
dwelling-place."  Moreover, it was affirmed that&#xD;
through this land the ambitious young French-&#xD;
man hoped to reach the Bkitish possessions in&#xD;
India, and to found a new empire, extending&#xD;
from the mouths of the Nile to the banks of&#xD;
the Ganges. This idea, though vague and ex-&#xD;
travagant, roused the British nation, which still&#xD;
smafted from the loss of its American colonies,&#xD;
and nothing was left undone that afforded the&#xD;
slightest prospect of thwartig Bonaparte's plans,&#xD;
Large reinforcements were sent to Lord Nelson,&#xD;
whose fleet had been seeU by the French frigates,&#xD;
as they sailed past Candia on their way to Alex-&#xD;
andria, shrouded by a friendly haze---a fact which&#xD;
was highly annoying to tbo British tars, And&#xD;
&#xD;
secret agents, well provided with gold, were d&amp;amp;.&#xD;
spatched to every accessible port on the Medi.&#xD;
terranean.&#xD;
Prominent among these agents was Colonel&#xD;
Hudson Lowe, a young Englishman, who added&#xD;
most of the frivolities and many of the crimes of&#xD;
fashionable life to a malignant and treacherous&#xD;
disposition. Detected when an ensign in an at-&#xD;
tempt to cheat at the card-table, he only escaped&#xD;
an ignominious dismissal from the British army&#xD;
by accepting a commission in the "Itediterra-&#xD;
fean regiment." - This was composed of rene'&#xD;
gades, Corsicans, Italians and Spaniards; outz&#xD;
casts of every degree and of every dye, from thd&#xD;
taurderer to the debauchee, who sought refuge&#xD;
under the English flag, and preferred the iron&#xD;
severity of military discipline to the punishment&#xD;
from which they had escaped. Admirably fitted&#xD;
to rule such desperadoes, young Lowe was raps&#xD;
idly promoted, and at the siege of Toulon, ho&#xD;
was promised his rank in one of the regular regi'&#xD;
ments of infantry, if he would but kill or capture&#xD;
Bonaparte, whose sudden appearance lent conA&#xD;
quering vigor to the French forces. He was un&#xD;
successful. General O'Hara was as Unsuccessful&#xD;
as he had been when second in command to Lord&#xD;
Cornwallis at Yorktown, in Virginia.  Colonel&#xD;
Lowe, thwarted in his hopes, vowed vengeance&#xD;
against Napoleon. Bonaparte. England-could&#xD;

not have selected a more fitting tool, and the&#xD;
commencement of his operations showed how&#xD;
deeply he could plot and project.&#xD;
"The Albatross," a noted smuggling cutter,&#xD;
had been seized a few weeks previous, and con-&#xD;
fiscated. Colonel Lowe saw.her at Portsmouth,&#xD;
and obtained her for his cruise, enlisting her for-&#xD;
mer captain and crew, who were delighted to get&#xD;
out of'jiil. Thoroughly sea-worthy, she was a&#xD;
beautiful craft, with sharp bows, great beam,&#xD;
bright copper,.and a run clean as a racer's fet-&#xD;
locks. Her lower masts were clean-scraped and&#xD;
brightly varnished, sustaining taper topmasts&#xD;
painted white, with many a mazy line of well&#xD;
laid cordage. Her well cut canvass was as white&#xD;
as the snowy foam at her bows when going be-&#xD;
fore a stiff breeze; nor was anything lacking-&#xD;
fore-topmast staysail, jib, mainsail, upper kite,&#xD;
studding-sails aloft and alow, ringtail-nothing&#xD;
,wanting. Nor did a more gallant crtft ever&#xD;
float.&#xD;
Leaving England's chalky cliffs, the "Alba-&#xD;
tross" cleaved the waves like a wedge, and her&#xD;
crew, overjoyed at receiving their liberty, worked&#xD;
with alacrity and spirit. The tempestuous Bay&#xD;
of Bis'ay was sopn traversed, the rocky citadel&#xD;
of Gibialtar was passed, and the anchor was&#xD;
dropped, after a quick run, in the pleasant har-&#xD;
bor of Ajacdio, the principal City in te island of&#xD;
Coisica.' Here, Where Bonaparte wasborn, the&#xD;
wily Englishman sought men who would execute'&#xD;
his schemes with zest, and felt certain that he&#xD;
coul&amp;amp;ind them. Beautiful as is'tle face of the&#xD;
island, the'happiness of its inhabitants is marredI&#xD;
by a horrible system of family feuds.&#xD;

the labor of man. A bullet sends the unfortu.&#xD;
nate man to his last account, and a rough wooden&#xD;
cross marks the spot where he fell.&#xD;
Day after day did Colonel Lowe stroll about&#xD;
Ajaccio and its vicinity, endeavoring to find&#xD;
some one who cherished a vendetta against the-&#xD;
object of his hatred. At last, he learned that&#xD;
Carlo de Bonaparte, the general's rather, had,&#xD;
some thirty years previous, accidentally killed&#xD;
the father of oneGiacomo, an honest wine-seller.&#xD;
The emissary at once repaired to his shop, and&#xD;
ordered a flask of the best wine in the-cellar,&#xD;
which soon sparkled on the table.&#xD;
"And now, Giacomo," said Colonel Lowe,&#xD;
with a cold yet gracious smile, "sit down and&#xD;
join me in the discussion of your wine."&#xD;
"Thanks, excellency," replied the frank look-&#xD;
ing, good-natured host, but his quick intellect&#xD;
instantly mistrusted his entertainer. English&#xD;
officers were frequent visitors at Ajaccio, but he&#xD;
nivest before had known one of them to drink&#xD;
and chat with a peasant. Neither did he like&#xD;
the distrustful glances cast from  beneath the&#xD;
shelter of his long and lowering red eye-lashes.&#xD;
"Your townsman Bonaparte," soon observed&#xD;
Colonel Lowe, "is making quite 'a noise in the&#xD;
world. It is perhaps lucky that he did not'stop&#xD;
af Corsica on his way to Egypt, or your ven-&#xD;
detta 'might have given him trouble."&#xD;
"My vendetta, excellency ?"&#xD;
"0, I know all about it. Nor is it wrong'fbr&#xD;
you to wish to avenge your father's death. Lis-&#xD;
ten,I my' good fellow. You-know me. I have&#xD;
commanded your countrymen. I speak your&#xD;
language. Well, I too have a -vendetta against&#xD;
Napoleon' Bonaparte. Join me, and you shall&#xD;
be well paid.- Gratify your vengeance, and wealth&#xD;
awaits you. " Think of this offer, and should-you&#xD;
decide to- accept my proposition, cpme on board&#xD;
yonder cutter, prepared for a cruise up the Le-&#xD;
vant. E'ood day."&#xD;
And'fiinging a purse of gold upon the tab,&#xD;
the Eiglish officer strode away, leaving Giacoiiao&#xD;
in a bewildering state of surprise and indignation.&#xD;
" endetta-wealth;-vengeance !I"  e ejacu-&#xD;
laied. "Why, if my poor father'was accidentally&#xD;
shot by Monsientde Bonaparte, did he not pro-&#xD;
videfor iy tdther and all of Us children'? And&#xD;
was not Madame Letitia ever solicitous for our&#xD;
comfort? And Wapoleon-why I sat on the&#xD;
sante 'bench with him at Madatne Mttselli's&#xD;

&#xD;
down that insolent red-coat, instead of listening&#xD;
to his wicked words ?" And the honest coun-&#xD;
tenance of the wine merchant glowed with indig-&#xD;
nation as he spoke.&#xD;
"Bravo! bravissimo !" responded a musical&#xD;
voice, and' a heavy cypress vine that shrouded&#xD;
the window was pushed to one side, disclosing a&#xD;
small, emaciated looking man, wearing an ec-&#xD;
clesiastical costume.&#xD;
"Saints preserve us !" exclaimed Giacomo.&#xD;
"Is that you, Father Jerome, and have you&#xD;
overheard the offer made me by that fiend in a&#xD;
red coat ?"&#xD;
"Ay, and you must accept of it ?"&#xD;
"Not I ! What? Murder my schoolmate-&#xD;
my benefactor's child I"&#xD;
"No-but preserve his life."&#xD;
And the priest soon convinced Giacomo that&#xD;
by accompanying Colonel Lowe, he could not&#xD;
only thwart his evil designs, but perhaps avert&#xD;
the assassin's dagger from Bonaparte. Leaving&#xD;
his shop in charge of his sister, and hastily pack-&#xD;
ing a few articles of clothing in 'a light basket,&#xD;
the wine-seller repaired to the quay. Here he&#xD;
engaged a boat, and soon stood on the white&#xD;
deck of the "Albatross." Colonel Lowe had&#xD;
seen him approach, and welcomed him on board,&#xD;
assigning him a berth with the mates. Prepara-&#xD;
tions were madefor sailing the water casks were&#xD;
sent ashore-and filled, the new hands came on&#xD;
board, and as the sun rope the next morning, the&#xD;
"Albatross " left the harbor, like an imprisoned&#xD;
bird set free. Among the gazers on the quay,&#xD;
&#xD;
"I&#xD;
'1&#xD;

&#xD;
Giacomo could distinctly see Father Jerome, and&#xD;
as the wind filled the sails, the good priest raised&#xD;
his hands, as if to bless the shield so providen-&#xD;
tially interposed between his loved pupil and a&#xD;
vindictive enemy.&#xD;
Giacomo had always been fond of the sea,&#xD;
and he was delighted with the cutter, which was&#xD;
a man-of-war in miniature. Four handsome&#xD;
brass guns were on either side of the neat deck,&#xD;
and amidships a heavier piece, mounted on a&#xD;
revolving carriage, was sheltered by the long-&#xD;
boat. Cutlasses and boarding-pikes were ranged&#xD;
against the bulwarks, nor was there a rope out&#xD;
of place, or a spar that was not symmetrically&#xD;
squared. The crew, which had been doubled in&#xD;
number at Corsica, was composed of sturdy,&#xD;
daring seamen, most of them old smugglers.&#xD;
Nor was there, in the whole British navy, a more&#xD;
gallant commander than Jack'Norman. The cut-&#xD;
ter was his idol, Its construction had swallowed&#xD;
up all his savings and his wife's dowry, for he&#xD;
felt certain that could he but escape the custom-&#xD;
house officers with her for one year, he would&#xD;
acquire a competence. But he had'not reckoned&#xD;
upon treason, and a falsp friend betraye4him&#xD;
on his first voyage. All was lost.    I.&#xD;
Colonel Lowe, however, came like a guardian&#xD;
.angel, and the smuggler was 'iow cheered' by&#xD;
the hope that, could Bonaparte be captured or&#xD;
killed, his craft would be restored to him. Need&#xD;
it be added that he used every caution to for-&#xD;
ward the plans of his master, and was stimulated&#xD;
by his nantical pride.&#xD;

THE' MA&#xD;
&#xD;
But whilst the sounds of revelry echoed&#xD;
through the camp, all was quiet at head-quar-&#xD;
ters-ofllcers and soldiers indulged in luxurious&#xD;
dissipation,. but the iron-nerved mind of the&#xD;
young commander-in-chief was never relaxed.&#xD;
During the day-time, he received deputations&#xD;
from the Egyptians, and framed granite edicts,&#xD;
upon which he hoped to rebuild the glorious&#xD;
empire of Isis. And. at night, long after the&#xD;
violin and the castanet had ceased to inspire the&#xD;
merry dance, and when no sound met the ear&#xD;
save the measured'tread of the sentries, or the&#xD;
challenge of the patrols, the future emperor ma-&#xD;
tured those gigantic plans which afterwards en-&#xD;
abled him to gle France, and to sway all Eu-&#xD;
rope.&#xD;
Judith was domesticated at the kiosk, and&#xD;
soon became a delightful companion for Bona-&#xD;
partej who ever retained his Jomestic habits.&#xD;
Nor was it long ere he discovered her superior,&#xD;
vocal powers, and persuaded her to receive mu-&#xD;
sical instruction.from one of his .band masters,&#xD;
an Italian who was well versed in his art. She&#xD;
proved herself an apt scholar, and was in a few&#xD;
weeks Able to sing the general's favorite airs,&#xD;
with a purity of intonation, and a brilliancy of&#xD;
execution, that captivated her hearer.&#xD;
"Decidedly," remarked Bonaparte, one even-&#xD;
ing, after listening to one of these improvised&#xD;
concerts,  "decidedly, Mademoiselle, Judith,&#xD;
you must go on the stage. I will promise you&#xD;
a good reception at the Paris opera, and allthese&#xD;
officers will take tickets to your benefit?'&#xD;
The stafE officers (as staff officers gways-do)&#xD;
echoed their general's wish; and from that mo-&#xD;
ment the younggirl's thoughts were all centered&#xD;
in a desire for professional success. Her instruc-&#xD;
tor, who did not fancy-military discipline, fanned&#xD;
the flame, and:Judith listened with delight to his&#xD;
account of the ovations paid to distinguished,&#xD;
vocalists by his warm-hearted countrymen. Bou-&#xD;
quets,.laurel-wreaths, serenading, processions-&#xD;
all served to increase the intoxication of the'&#xD;
pupil, and to stimulate her to fresh exertion.,&#xD;
Osmanli was also an inmate at head-quarters,&#xD;
having been admitted to the general-staff, with&#xD;
the rank of "captain-interpreter.' The young&#xD;
manhadibeen denounced by Mourad Bey as a&#xD;
renegade and the faithful'followers of the prophet&#xD;
were enjoined to kill him, as a "dog " who had&#xD;
forsaken his-creed, and his master-who had vio-&#xD;
lated the sanctity of a harem and carried off one&#xD;
of its inmates-who now dwelt with the infidel&#xD;
French, and ate their bread. "Accursed-thrice&#xD;
&#xD;
lELUKE,                                19&#xD;
accursed be Osmanli the renegade," proclaimed&#xD;
the teachers in the mosques, after morning,&#xD;
prayers; "let him be swept from the earth'&#xD;
And the hearers, bowing reverentially towards&#xD;
Mecca, responded, "Allah alone is great )and&#xD;
Mahomet is his prophet-let the renegade Or&#xD;
manli die 1"&#xD;
.Little cared Osmanli for this excomminiba-&#xD;
tion, for the charms of Judith had completely&#xD;
enthralled his heart, and the giant intellect of&#xD;
Bonaparte had captivated his will. Nor was it&#xD;
to be wondered at that the young Jewess had&#xD;
fascinated the yoting soldier, for he had never&#xD;
before enjoyed the charms of female society, and&#xD;
now, all his dreams were more than'realized.&#xD;
Harmonious and lovely to behold, and to think&#xD;
of, there was not a solitary fragment of her&#xD;
character out of proportion with the rest. Grace-&#xD;
ful, ethereal and gifted, she appeared to the young&#xD;
Mameluke like the animated statue of a Grecian&#xD;
sculptor,, inspired by all the gifts of education&#xD;
and of refinement. Hour after hour did ,he lin.&#xD;
ger on the divan where she wrote from Bons-&#xD;
pirte's hurried dictation, and gaze on her with&#xD;
rapturous delight, treasuring her, every smile&#xD;
with miser-like avarice. A new feeling-a new&#xD;
sense-entered his very soul, and'her presence&#xD;
.was the sunlight of his life, endowing all things&#xD;
with animation during its efftlgence, but leaving&#xD;
them dark when it disappeared. .Andhis heart,&#xD;
like the smothered bulb of the hyacinth, longer&#xD;
to send forth pure flowers of affection, that, if she&#xD;
but deigned to encourage their growth, could&#xD;
bask in the brightness of her eyes, and expand&#xD;
into the beauties of that perfect;,recipiocated love, '&#xD;
which is the choicest reality of life.&#xD;
But Judith, although she could not but have&#xD;
perceived'the depth and intensity of the young&#xD;
Matneluke's affection, -gave him but little- en-&#xD;
couragement that it was reciprocated. Love, In&#xD;
'true female hearts, is too holy and fervent a pas-&#xD;
sion to be kindled by every passing sparks but&#xD;
requires earnest and continued fanning ere its&#xD;
refined flame blazes with steady light, exerting&#xD;
over its possessor the vivifying influence of an&#xD;
all enlivening passion. Occasionally, when Ju-&#xD;
dith would allude to her past dangers, Osmanli&#xD;
would hope, for her cheek would glow with&#xD;
gratitude, and her eye *ould beam with unntter&#xD;
able affection. Then, a cloud would seem to&#xD;
shoot athwart her heart, and her manner would&#xD;
relapse into a rigid, icy coldness, that effectually&#xD;
checked any declaation on the part of ier&#xD;
admirer.&#xD;

Nor wag' Osmanli alone in his adiiration of&#xD;

upon his vanity,:nor was it the less painful' be-&#xD;
cause it touched an unfathomed. spot in his heart.,&#xD;
For somO days he watched the young lovers&#xD;

and superior qualifications. But when-he found&#xD;

&#xD;
the rapidity with which he passed from one topic&#xD;
to another, showed how impossible it was to&#xD;
escape from the dominant idea of his heart.&#xD;
Let him urge his thoughts wherever he would,&#xD;
they would rush back and revel in a glow of ad-&#xD;
miration, until forced out again, like the mes-&#xD;
senger dove, to find no resting place.&#xD;
Just then a "kandja," or barge, came very&#xD;
near the bank, as it ascended the stream. It&#xD;
was manned by a dozen Arabs, and as they bent&#xD;
to their huge oars, they joined in the chorus of a&#xD;
song chanted by the helmsman. Their voices&#xD;
were harsh, and the air was monotonous, yet&#xD;
there was something pleasing in the chorus:&#xD;
"Ty'eb-ty'eb-en ni moobarek !"&#xD;
"Good-good-is the blessed Nile," repeated&#xD;
Osmanli, " and a blessed river it is to the Egyp.&#xD;
tians. Indeed, the Mahometans say that if their&#xD;
prophet had but tasted its waters, he would have&#xD;
prayed for terrestrial immortality, that he might&#xD;
have enjoyed it forever. To me, though," and&#xD;
the speaker's heart beat fast, while he turned his&#xD;
eloquent eyes upon Judith, as if to study the&#xD;
effect of his every word, "to me, though, the&#xD;
NAP is but an. emblem of my own existence.&#xD;
No one knows where it rises, neither am I aware&#xD;
were I first drew breath, or from what source&#xD;
my blood flowed into life. It first is known&#xD;
anong the barbarous Abyssinians, even as I, in&#xD;
eadylife, found myself among the Mamelukes.&#xD;
And, it pursues its course, for many a hundred&#xD;
milea, without receiving a single tributary streani&#xD;
-avea--even-ay, dear Judith, as my life has&#xD;
been passed in heart loneliness. Here, having&#xD;
leftbehind the desert and the squalid villages, it&#xD;
laves this lovely garden-and I, dear Judith,&#xD;
now bask in the sunlight of your smile. 01&#xD;
cannot my love meet a response? cannot_.-"&#xD;
' BtopI For my'sake, stop I" exclaimed Ju-&#xD;
dith. When the young soldier commenced his&#xD;
ayuwaL, she had raised her full eyes with invol-&#xD;
unny. surprise, then, turning pale, and her&#xD;
whole frame quivering with emotion, she inter-&#xD;
trued-him:&#xD;
l" Nay," he continued, with an imploring ges-&#xD;
tute, "listen to me F"&#xD;
"Not another word in such a Strain. You&#xD;
&#xD;
saved my life, Osmanli, and during that life you&#xD;
will find me grateful. Lt us be friends-true&#xD;
friends. Let me be as your sister. Let me see&#xD;
you leave all your Mahometan habits, and rise&#xD;
high under the powerful protection of General&#xD;
Bonaparte. But-" and here, her voice falter-&#xD;
ing, she-burst into tears.&#xD;
The tender despondency with which this re-&#xD;
fusal had been uttered, saddened and influenced&#xD;
Osmanli, whose bursting heart could find no&#xD;
words for utterance. No words could have ex-&#xD;
pressed his anguish.&#xD;
At that moment a heavy cloud swept before&#xD;
the face of the moon, and east a deep shadow&#xD;
over the river.&#xD;
"See !" said Judith.' "That you now love&#xD;
me I do not deny, and my refusal to reciprocate&#xD;
your affection, like yonder cloud, may darken&#xD;
your heart. But as the river will flow on-will&#xD;
again become bright-and will to-morrow derive&#xD;
-more brilliancy from the sun than it just received&#xD;
from the moon, so your heart will find others&#xD;
who will add more to your happiness than I can."&#xD;
.1 e"er I never I" exclaimed the sorrow-&#xD;
stricken young man. "But can you give me no&#xD;
hope ?"I&#xD;
" Osmanli," replied the maiden. "Brother&#xD;
Osmanli-I am one of a peculiar people, and&#xD;
from early youth- have been taught that God&#xD;
commands me to honor my father. Perchance,&#xD;
in years to come, we may all meet, and then, if&#xD;
you persevere in your flattering appreciation of&#xD;
my poor oelf, I shall refer you to him. But.-&#xD;
decidedly--I Cannot, until he approves your suit,&#xD;
grant you the least encouragement. Good-night.&#xD;
May the God of Israel bless you."&#xD;
And ere the sorrow-stricken youth could re-&#xD;
cover from his astonishment, she had left him.&#xD;
Late that night did he walkthrough that garden,"&#xD;
heedless of a severe rain storm whichraged after&#xD;
midnight. What a change had that day brought&#xD;
about?  In the morning everything looked&#xD;
bright, for his future pathway was illuminated&#xD;
by hopes of his love, which, like the silver planet&#xD;
of the night, tinged everything with its own-&#xD;
beauty. Now, that brilliant sky was weereast by&#xD;

the boy again prophesied. "Many years have&#xD;
passed, and the warrior is dead. He breathes&#xD;
his last on an island. He is followed to the&#xD;
tomb by soldiers in scarlet uniforms."&#xD;
"Not bad," again interrupted Bonaparte. "I&#xD;
wished, gentlemen, to know where I should,&#xD;
breathe my last, and itjsppears.that I shall die&#xD;
King of Engla'nd, and be buried on that foggy&#xD;
island by my conquered foes. A rare idea. - But&#xD;
lot us hear abdut the rest of you."&#xD;
. The other officers now.interrogated the boy,&#xD;
and laughed at what they regarded as flattery.&#xD;
Some,'he predicted, would wear crowns, all&#xD;
would attain rank and fortune. Yet to three or&#xD;
four, he described their last moments in fearful&#xD;
colors, depicting them horribly mutilated by&#xD;
cannon ball -or sabre stroke. Atlength, when&#xD;
he had gone the round, Bonaparte said:&#xD;
"Now, Osmanli, inquire about your own des-&#xD;
tiny, but be sure and interpret all that he says."&#xD;
"Every syllable," replied Osmanli,\ and im-&#xD;
mediately commenced: "Why is this young&#xD;
sapling of the western forests away from his&#xD;
home? He weareth the French uniform, yet is&#xD;
not a Christian. Neither is the creed of Maho-&#xD;

be tried again. Yonderpyramids perish---minds&#xD;
and hearts are annihilated-but in this young&#xD;
man's heart doth the great secret reign. I pay&#xD;
it reverence. I have done."&#xD;
And the boy fell down, in violent convulsions,&#xD;
which lasted about five minutes, 4fter which he&#xD;
fellinto a trance, and then awoke with an ex-&#xD;
pression-of bewilderment and surprise.&#xD;
The magician was ,liberally rewarded, even&#xD;
those who laughed the most at his predictions&#xD;
treatinghim with marked respect. Wise and&#xD;
gifte&amp;amp;minds, in every age, have been impressed&#xD;
byreN1ations of hidden truth. And there have&#xD;

SGeneral,"said one of the officers, :"1do not&#xD;

Madame Bonaparte is a firm believer in divina-&#xD;

&#xD;
MELUKE.&#xD;
"It is, Berthier," was the reply, "and if you&#xD;
will all sit down in this summer-house, I will tell&#xD;
you, as she has often told me, how and when she&#xD;
became impressed with the belief.&#xD;
"Madame Bonaparte,-as most of you know,&#xD;
is a native of Martinique, where she passed her&#xD;
childhood. One day, when she was just budding&#xD;
into womanhood, she was persuaded by two&#xD;
-friends to visit a noted sibyl, who inspired great&#xD;
dread among the negroes far and near. No&#xD;
sooner did the old Pythoness see her, than she&#xD;
uttered a loud exclamation, and seized her hand,&#xD;
which was carefully examined.&#xD;
"'Well,' said Josephine, 'do you discover&#xD;
anything extraordinary in my destiny?' 'Yes,'&#xD;
was the reply. 'Is happiness or misfortune to&#xD;
be my lot?' 'Misfortune-yes, and happiness&#xD;
too.' 'But your oracles are not clear, my good&#xD;
dame.' 'I am not permitted te4render, them&#xD;
more clear,' said the old woman, raising her&#xD;
eyes towards heaven. 'But to the point,' ex-&#xD;
claimed Josephine, whose curiosity began to be&#xD;
excited. 'Tell me all that I am to fear and to&#xD;
hope.'&#xD;
"'Listen, then,' and the fortune-teller, exam-&#xD;
,ining Josephine's hand with scrupulous atten-&#xD;
tion. ' You will first marry a native of this isl-&#xD;
and, who will take you to Europe, where he will&#xD;
perish tragically, leaving you two helpless chil-&#xD;
dren. Your second husband will be a European,&#xD;
who will be famous without fortune, and who will&#xD;
prown you as his queen.' On coAchiding her pre-&#xD;
diction, the old hag hurried away as fast as her&#xD;
enfeebled limbs would permit. At first Jose-&#xD;
phine thought of the affair only to laugh at it,&#xD;
but when her first husband took her to Europe,&#xD;
and -then perished on the scaffold, she began to&#xD;
regard the prediction as byno means improbable."&#xD;
"And she may yet b_ queen," remarked&#xD;
Berthier.&#xD;
"Patience," replied Bonaparte, with a smile.&#xD;
"Let us wait until the pear is ripe before we talk&#xD;
of plucking it."&#xD;
Just then a gun-boat passed up the river, and&#xD;
was recognized as "the mail.boat from Alexan-&#xD;
dria, so all returned to the kiosk, eager to receive&#xD;
news from home. The dispatches were not long&#xD;
in arriving, and no sooner were the letters dis-&#xD;
tributed, than each officer retired 'to his own&#xD;
quarters.&#xD;
Late-that night, as Osmanli lay tossing upon&#xD;
his iouch, recalling the sad disappointment&#xD;
which had chilled hisaffections, and whichfilled&#xD;
his heart- 'iitht anguish, his door wausunddenly&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MA&#xD;
opened. Springing to his feet, he grasped his&#xD;
sabre, but his defensive attitude was soon changed&#xD;
to a deep reverence, for Bonaparte stood before&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Osmanli," said the general, "brother Os-&#xD;
manli, I know your disappointment, for I was&#xD;
an unintentional listener to what passed a few&#xD;
nights'since in the garden."&#xD;
The young man's face turned crimson.&#xD;
"Nay," continued Bonaparte, "do not feel&#xD;
ashamed. Woman's heart is a more incom-&#xD;
prehensible riddle than the inscriptions on the&#xD;
monuments around us, and perseverance always&#xD;
brings success. But that jealous rascal, Margry,&#xD;
is evidently dogging your footsteps, and I think&#xD;
it would be best for you to go away for awhile.&#xD;
At any rate, I wish to send a trusty messenger&#xD;
to France, and have selected you."&#xD;
"But-but-gener'al," asked Osmanli, " who&#xD;
will protect Judith ?"&#xD;

"Is her father not my brother as well as thine5"&#xD;
replied Bonaparte. " Have no fears upon this&#xD;
point. A boat will go down the river to-Inor-&#xD;
row, and Berthier will furnish you with the ne-&#xD;
cessary funds. I wish you to go to Paris as&#xD;
speedily as possible, and then to remain near&#xD;
Madame Bonaparte until I order you otherwise.&#xD;
One of my correspondents dares to hin't that she&#xD;
is unfaithful, and I wish you, without acting the&#xD;
part of a spy, to inform me if you discover any..&#xD;
thing wrong in her conduct. Now, good-night.&#xD;
I have my letters to write."&#xD;
This sudden departure, after all, was not re..&#xD;
pugnant to the young man's feelings. His heart&#xD;
was sad, and any change was 'acceptable. Be-&#xD;
sides, he had become enamored with the ciVil-&#xD;
ized manners of the French, and their superior&#xD;
social condition.&#xD;

equally renowned for gay society, lovely women, covered with velvet cushions. A harp, with silver&#xD;
and fresh figs.&#xD;
&#xD;
keys, stoodin theeorner,andupon a table covered&#xD;
with pure white linen, stood a huge silver can-&#xD;
delabra, with seven branches. A pair of rare&#xD;
singing-birds were 'suspended from the ceiling in&#xD;
a gilded cage, and in the deep latticed window&#xD;
were rare exotic plants, whose fragrance per-&#xD;
fumed the room.&#xD;
The occupant of this elegant room presented&#xD;
a marked contrast to its luxuriance as he ushered&#xD;
in his guests, bowed down by the weight of ty-&#xD;
ranny and the everlasting sin of his race. Dressed,&#xD;
in a dirty cloth robe, his sallow countenance,&#xD;
sunken eye, and neglected beard, all proclaimed&#xD;
the oppressed existence which he endured, but&#xD;
his quivering lip showed that there was in addi-&#xD;
tion some present grief. Inviting his visitors to&#xD;
be seated upon the ottoman, he carefully perused&#xD;
the letter, examined the water-mark of the paper,&#xD;
and then said, in choice French:&#xD;
"Your excellency is welcome to Smyrna,&#xD;
and any funds you may need will be forthcom-&#xD;
ing, although, bowed down'by sorrow,I fear that&#xD;
I cannot minister to your comfort. Grief ind,&#xD;
bitterness are all I have to offer in my humble&#xD;
abode."&#xD;
"Has anything occurred, that yott are so de-&#xD;
pressed P' inquired Colonel Lowe.&#xD;
"eHappened!1" said Mordecai. "My daugh-&#xD;
ter, my darling Judith, the light of these old&#xD;
eyes, is in the hands of the Philistines. In an'&#xD;
evil hour I permitted the rabbi of our synagogue&#xD;
to take her to Genoa, that her voice might be&#xD;
attuned for the Psalms of David in our taberna-&#xD;
cle. Months passed, but no tidings came-the&#xD;
felucca never reached Genoa. At laSt Ireceived&#xD;
positive intelligence that she was captured by an&#xD;
Alexandrian corsair-sold in the slave market-&#xD;
carried to Cairo-and was to enter the harem of&#xD;
Mourad Bey. Alas! Alas I'The Edomites&#xD;
have triumphed, and my old age is as desolate&#xD;
as the hills about jerusalem."&#xD;
"But have not the French-reached Cairo ?"&#xD;
"I know not. Some of the Egyptian Mame-&#xD;
lukes who were here hastened to Egypt when&#xD;
they learned that their country was invade4-&#xD;
but we have no tidings from the land of bondage.&#xD;
Ay, ay-a land of bondage it is, and I fear that&#xD;
there is no deliverance for my poor daughter."&#xD;
"The French will respect her though, if they&#xD;
have, not been repulsed," remarked Colonel&#xD;
Lowe, who felt somewhat interested, so poignant&#xD;
was the old man's grief.&#xD;
"IThere is my only hope," replied Mordecai.&#xD;
"4Although the Moslems will kill the inmates of&#xD;
&#xD;
their harems, rather than let them fall into the&#xD;
hands of Christians. Did I things that she was&#xD;
protected by the French, if money could buy a&#xD;
vessel, I would soon be on my way to Egypt.&#xD;
But we are a crushed, oppressed people, and I&#xD;
fear that my daughter, for whom I have toiled,&#xD;
and garnered, and endured contumely, will never&#xD;
sit again in joyousness under her father's fig-tree,&#xD;
with none to make her ashamed, or afraid."&#xD;
Here waq   nother golden opportunity, and&#xD;
Colonel Lowe started with joy. Under the pre-&#xD;
text of seeking the fair daughter, Giacomo would&#xD;
be *introduced into Egypt, and could approach&#xD;
the supposed object of his vendetta.&#xD;
"Monsieur Fezenzac," said he, " I am cruis-&#xD;
ing about in the Levant, in a fast sailing cutter,&#xD;
and can carry you to Egypt if you desire it.&#xD;
That is, if the French consul here will grant us&#xD;
letters-of-truce, to save us from capture."&#xD;
"Thanks, a thousand thanks," exclaimed the&#xD;
the Jew. "May the God of Israel bless you.&#xD;
The French consul is my debtor, and I can easily&#xD;
obtain the desired papers."&#xD;
" And how soon can you leave ?"&#xD;
"How soon    01, I can leave ere the sun sets,&#xD;
for even as the hart pants after the water brooks,&#xD;
so do I long to see my beloved Judith."&#xD;
" I will return on board again, then," said&#xD;
Colonel Lowe, "and we can sail the moment&#xD;
you come on board. Good-by, then, fbr a few&#xD;
hours."&#xD;
And as the gratified Englishman strode away,&#xD;
the Jew heaped blessings upon his head. Poor&#xD;
Giacomo. As the hour approached when he was&#xD;
to be called upon to execute the deadly scheme,&#xD;
his heart failed him, lest he might not be able to&#xD;
avert his old friend, and be seized as an assassin.&#xD;
The cutter was immediately prepared for sea,&#xD;
greatly to the disappointment of the sailors, who&#xD;
had counted upon a revel on shore. But that&#xD;
same afternoon Mordecai came on board with&#xD;
the French consul. The necessary papers were&#xD;
made out, the French flag was hoisted, and then&#xD;
the consul,,having received a large parting loan&#xD;
from the enraptured Jew, returned on shore.&#xD;
"All hands up anchor, ahoy I'" now echoed&#xD;
through the cutter. .The capstan-bars were rig-&#xD;
ged, and the men heaved away, until the anchor&#xD;
was "short."  Sail was then made, the anchor&#xD;
was tripped and stowed, and the cutter was fairly&#xD;
aweigh before sunset. Glorious was that setting&#xD;
sun, as it gilded the mountains which form the&#xD;
western boundary of the lovely bay through&#xD;
which the cutter glided;&#xD;

"Not as ip northern climes obscurely bright,&#xD;
But one uncdouded blaze ofiving light.&#xD;
O'er thehdshed deep the yellow beam he throws,&#xD;
Gilds the green wave that trembles as It glows."&#xD;
The next day, as the cutter left the island of&#xD;
P atmos on her lee, the breeze died entirely away.&#xD;
The sky was intensely blue, with an occasional&#xD;
fleecy cloud drifting lazily through the azure ex-&#xD;
panse, nor did a ripple disturb the broad expanse&#xD;
of water. . The cutter lay becalmed, her sails,&#xD;
flapping against the masts, and had it not been&#xD;
for the idle rocking occasioned by the ground&#xD;
swell, she would have appeared motionless.,&#xD;
This was torture to the afflicted Jew, who had&#xD;
battled against his sea-sickness while they made&#xD;
rapid progress, but now was the image of misery.&#xD;
Neither was the grim Briton in the best of hu-&#xD;
mor, especially as Giacomo showe&amp;amp; an unwil-&#xD;

"9Will this weather always last 1" he inquired&#xD;
of Jack Norman,.with a fearful oath.&#xD;
"I fear not," was the- reply, "for a storm is&#xD;
brewing, if I am not mistaken." And soon the&#xD;
experienced mariner ordered his light sails to be&#xD;
taken in, and housedhis fying-jib boom. The&#xD;
hatches were closely battened down, and every&#xD;
preparation-made for what Jack called "a Le-&#xD;
vanter."&#xD;
Night came - on, and as the blood-red sui&#xD;
sank down into the molten waters, a breeze&#xD;
swelled out the courses of what sails remained&#xD;
set. Masses of dark clouds drifted hurriedly&#xD;
along, and the atmosphere felt gloomy andheavy.&#xD;
The wind increased. Sail after sail was taken&#xD;
in, but the cutter dashed on, faster and faster.&#xD;
Soon, rapid and vivid flashes of forked lightning&#xD;
shone across the angry billows, and peals of&#xD;
crashing thunder added to the terrific grandeur&#xD;
of the scene. The gale increased to a hurricane,&#xD;
sails were close-reefed, the storm-staysail set,&#xD;
and the "Albatross " struggled before the fury&#xD;
of the tempest, now poising on the top of a&#xD;
mighty wave-now, with a shudder, sinking into&#xD;
the deep hollow of the sea.&#xD;
Poor GiacomoI He felt that it was a judg-&#xD;
meut, and at -last became so alarmed, that he&#xD;
communicated his fears to the sailors, with whom&#xD;
he had become intimate. - They, naturally super_&#xD;
stitious, agreed that the Englishman was a sec-&#xD;
ond;Jonah, and it was determined to get rid of&#xD;
&#xD;
him as soon as possible. At last, land was seen,&#xD;
looming up in the foggy storm, and surrounded&#xD;
by breakers. But ere the cutter could be kept&#xD;
away, the solitary staysail which kept her before&#xD;
the wind was blown from the bolt-ropes, and as&#xD;
she lay rolling in the heavy chopping sea, stout&#xD;
heart lost courage.&#xD;
A cry was heardI In the confusion, Colohel&#xD;
Lowe and the Jew went overboard, whether ac-&#xD;
cidentally or not, no one knew. But it was im-&#xD;
possible to, lower a boat, and so hen-coops,&#xD;
benches, and .other light materials were thrown&#xD;
overboard. The colonel was an excellent swim.&#xD;
mer, and managed to, reach a large hen-coop,&#xD;
upon which he floated- securely, and dragged&#xD;
Fezenzac, more dead than alive. The current&#xD;
carried them rapidly towards the shore, but the&#xD;
cutter on which a new staysail had been set, an-&#xD;
swered her helm, and she managed to weather&#xD;
the promontory, with its menacing breakers.&#xD;
Oikce free of the land, Norman had the masts&#xD;
cut away, so that he was enabled to ride out the&#xD;
gale, and then rigging a jury-mast, on the fourth&#xD;
day of the passage, he reached the island of&#xD;
Rhodes.&#xD;
.The English squadron, just before the gale,&#xD;
had put in at the harbor of Rhodes for fresh wa-&#xD;
ter. So when Jack Norman made the light-&#xD;
house, and run boldly in. between the points on&#xD;
which the feet of the famed colossus once rested,&#xD;
he found himself among his countrymen-&#xD;
Colonel Lowe and Mordecai-were also saved.&#xD;
After clinging to the hen-coop f'or hours, as it&#xD;
was tossed over the billows, they were drifted&#xD;
on shore. Some Turkish fishermen found them&#xD;
on the beach, almost exhausted; but Mordecai&#xD;
had a potent claim for assistance. Their clothes&#xD;
were dried, their hunger was relieved, and that&#xD;
night they were taken to the once proud city of&#xD;
Ephesus. Goats now browse, where Pliny tells&#xD;
us the largest population in Asia Minor once.&#xD;
dwelti nor are there many tokens of the once&#xD;
proud temple of Diana, but it is easy to trace&#xD;
the walls of that.famous lodge-room where the&#xD;
gogd saint John once held the gavel. Business,&#xD;
and pleasure, and worship have all passed away,&#xD;
yet Mordecai found those to whom he was united&#xD;
by a "mystic tie." They relieved him and his&#xD;
companion, nor was it many days ere the ship-&#xD;
wrecked couple arived- safely back at Smyrna.&#xD;
&#xD;
rl&#xD;
&#xD;
had just swept relentlessly across the face of so-&#xD;
ciety, engulfing monarchy,' and polluting the&#xD;
sacred name of liberty by sanguinary butcheries,&#xD;
yet the saloons of Paris lost not their brilliancy.&#xD;
Female influence, graceful in its sway, there re-&#xD;
strained the political gladiators, and, even the&#xD;
supreme heartlessness that was so apparent had&#xD;
its pleasing effect, increasing the brilliancy of the&#xD;
wit, as a frosty atmosphere enhances the bright-&#xD;
ness of the stars.&#xD;
Remaining in the ante-room, Osmanli took&#xD;
from his finger a ring, and sent it to Madame&#xD;
Bonaparte by a servant, with a request that she&#xD;
would receive his dispatches. It was Napoleon's&#xD;
well-known signet, and in a. few moments the&#xD;
messenger returned, to usher Osianli into a&#xD;
gorgeously furnished boudoir. Here Josephine&#xD;
awaited him, and the young soldier was dazzled&#xD;
by her personal appearance. She was then in&#xD;
the prime of womanhood, and strangely beauti.&#xD;
ful. Her luxuriant ebon hair clustered in heavy&#xD;
curls over her strongly marked forehead, and&#xD;
shaded a countenance of tropical cast, yet daz-&#xD;
zling purity. Deep hazel eyes flashed a welcome&#xD;
through their long, black lashes. Her teeth&#xD;
nestkd like pearls between the rosy lips to which&#xD;
they imparted'so much expression, and a metepr-&#xD;
like diispple played on one of her soft, round&#xD;
cheeks. Welcoming Osmanli with inspiring&#xD;

&#xD;
OeMANLI, embarking at Alexandria, was for-&#xD;
tunate enough to escape the British cruisers, and&#xD;
arrived safely at Toulon, where he took the mail-&#xD;
coach for Paris. In vain were hospitalities ten-&#xD;
dered to him on his journey; nor did he antici-&#xD;
pate any of ,that enjoyment which is the grand&#xD;
magnetic attraction of the French metropolis.&#xD;
The voice of Judith Fezenzae alone rang in his&#xD;
ears, her visage was ever before his eyes, and&#xD;
thoughts of her alone occupied his sad soul, ex-&#xD;
hausting its freshness. And as he entered the&#xD;
metropolis-that focus of all that is dazzling in&#xD;
splendor, all that is elegant in manners, all that&#xD;
is brilliant in genius, all that is mighty in power&#xD;
-his thoughts were all upon the banks of the&#xD;
distant Nile; Everything appeared cheerful and&#xD;
bustling as he passed through the lighted streets,&#xD;
bat his heart was as dry as Gideon's fleece, while&#xD;
the dew-like influence of Parisian life fell gently.&#xD;
all around.&#xD;
Without stopping to change his attire, Osmanli&#xD;
repaired directly to the house of General Bona-&#xD;
parte, a modest residence, which had recently&#xD;
been purchased of his friend Talma, the trage-&#xD;
dian. Coaches were standing before qhe entrance,&#xD;
to the courtyard, and Osmanli was informed at&#xD;
.the gate that madame had guests within-one of&#xD;
those delectable re-unions for which Paris is so&#xD;
renowned. Revolution, with its bloody tide,&#xD;

30                               TI&#xD;
ease, she asked, in a voice tremulous with&#xD;
anxiety:&#xD;
"Victorious again ?"&#xD;
"Yes, lady," replied Osmanli, completely&#xD;
fascinated. "The general is master of Egypt,&#xD;
and his enemies are subdued by his prowess,&#xD;
even as-as-his lady conquers all hearts bf her&#xD;
beauty."&#xD;
"Bravo I" said Josephine, evidently as much&#xD;
delighted by the compliment as she was by the&#xD;
news. "Such language is truly oriental, and&#xD;
rarely heard in these days of liberty and equality.&#xD;
When I become Empress of France (for such is&#xD;
my predicted destiny), you shall be my chamber-&#xD;
lain. And now, captain; join the company.&#xD;
Don't look at your dusty uniform, but remember&#xD;
your tidings." And taking Osmanli byAthe&#xD;
hand, she opened a door which led them directly&#xD;
into the gay and brilliant saloon.&#xD;
It had already been whispered among the gay&#xD;
throng that an officer had arrived froi Egypt,&#xD;
and when Josephine re-appeared, leading Os-&#xD;
manli by the hand, there was a murmur of curi-&#xD;
ous excitement. The dancers ceased theirgrace-&#xD;
ful measure, the loto table was deserted, and the-&#xD;
whole party clustered arohnj the hostess and&#xD;
heir new guest.- Tb Osmanli, who had been&#xD;
reared'in-the East, the saene was one of enchant-&#xD;
ment.   The guests w40!i not numerous, but&#xD;
among ,them were some of the most beautiful&#xD;
women and the most intelligent Parisians-all&#xD;
as deferential to Josephine as a hive of bees are&#xD;
to their queen. And worthy was the -beautiful&#xD;
Creole of royal honor, as shemoved through the&#xD;
throng. Not with that measured tread which&#xD;
the mythologists attributed to Juno, but rather&#xD;
with that wayward, graceful motion with which,&#xD;
poets -represent the fairy-queen, as she receives&#xD;
the homage of her blithesome court.&#xD;
" My friends," said Josephine, "let me pre-&#xD;
sent to you*Captain Osmanli, one of,General&#xD;
Bofiaparte's oriental recruits, and a-member of&#xD;
his general staff. He *omes from the armyladen&#xD;
with tidings of victory, and will inpart his intel-&#xD;
ligence whilst I retire to read my husband's let-,&#xD;
ter. Listen to him and excuse me."&#xD;
Exclamations of joy, and plaudits from many&#xD;
a tiny gloved hand responded to this announce&amp;amp;&#xD;
meant, and Osmanli was at once the lion of the'&#xD;
evening. His recital of the battle (the first in-&#xD;
telligence)Was listened to with eagerness, qes-&#xD;
tions weet asked about friends or relatives in the&#xD;
army, regrets were uttered for those who had&#xD;
fallen, and then the merry dance was renewed&#xD;
with fresh gayety.&#xD;
&#xD;
To Osmanli, the scene was as bewitching as it&#xD;
was novel. When with Judith Fezenzac he had&#xD;
felt ennobled, as if holding intercour e with some&#xD;
seraphic visitor; but now he'found hi self encir-&#xD;
cled by the fair and the beautiful, the fascinating&#xD;
and the gay. Accustomed only. to veiled faces&#xD;
and to closely enveloped forms, he now witnessed,&#xD;
the twinkling of tiny feet in the circling dance,&#xD;
and encountered the formidable artillery of&#xD;
sparkling glances and beaming smiles, while&#xD;
angelic brows, like bended bows, menaced his&#xD;
peace. For the first time, he felt inclined to re-&#xD;
nounce his creed, and to pardon the bright pro-&#xD;
genitor of these bewitching creatures, who tempt-&#xD;
ed her lord to eat of the forbidden fruit; at any&#xD;
4 rate, he excused the ancient father of the human&#xD;
race. Had he been himself subjected to such&#xD;
overwhelming tests in sunny Eden, he felt that&#xD;
he should have yielded like - susceptible father&#xD;
Adam, and have felt little compunction as he&#xD;
*ras sent forth to be lighted round the earth by a&#xD;
pair of eyes whose flashes mocked the stars In&#xD;
brilliancy. Why, he thought, was Prometheus&#xD;
so-foolish as to steal fire from above, when earth&#xD;
is illuminated by such heavenly rays, or why did&#xD;
Zoroaster worship fire, when there were such&#xD;
overpowering beais in the light of lovely wo-&#xD;
man's eye1? . All the degrading ideas of his creed&#xD;
respecting woman melted away like an autumnal&#xD;
frost before a clear morning sun, and he stood,&#xD;
entranced as it were, watching the glittering&#xD;
throng.I&#xD;
The poetry of motion ceased, and- a lady&#xD;
whose exquisite dancing Osmanli had particu-.&#xD;
larly noticed, was handed to a seat near him.&#xD;
She wore deep mourning, which heightened the&#xD;
charms of her clear, ruddy complexion; large&#xD;
expressive eyes cast enticing glances, and full,&#xD;
pouting lips gave piquance to the tones of her&#xD;
musical voice.&#xD;
"Pardon me," she said, " but did you come,&#xD;
alone from Egypt ?"I&#xD;
"Alone, madame," replied Osmanli, "that is&#xD;
to say, in the cabin. There weresome wounded&#xD;
soldiers on board, however."&#xD;
The lady then asked many questions about&#xD;
.Bonaparte, his probable return, e~c.,-completely&#xD;
fascinating Osmanli ere Madame Bonaparte re-&#xD;
appeated. When she did come, her face was&#xD;
flushed, an4 joy beamed from every lineament&#xD;
of her countenance. Again ever' one gathered&#xD;
around her.&#xD;
"Well, my friends," she asked, "have you&#xD;
heard all the news? All about the victorious&#xD;
&#xD;
career of my martial spouse in the land of Pha-&#xD;
raoh?  Nay, I will warrant a dozen of gloves&#xD;
that Captain Osmanli has not informed you that&#xD;
he saved my husband's life! His blushes show&#xD;
that I am correct. But-what a giddy creature&#xD;
I am! Here this young man has travelled post-&#xD;
haste from Marseilles, and I am detaining him,&#xD;
famished and weary, for your amusement, as&#xD;
though he was a wild beast. Let me see-it&#xD;
will never do to' have so handsome a cavalier&#xD;
under the roof of my jealous husband-" and&#xD;
Josephine looked around her guests, as if seek-&#xD;
ing a host for Osmanli.&#xD;
"Will the gallant captain accept the shelter of&#xD;
my roof ?"asked the lady with whom Osmanli&#xD;
had entered into conversation.&#xD;
"Need I say, Josephine, that my ' prophetic&#xD;
chamber,' as you used to call it, is at the service-&#xD;
of your husband's deliverer." And this second&#xD;
offer of hospitality came from a matronly look-&#xD;
ing dame, who wore her own gray hair in flow-.&#xD;
ing curls, and whose features, although furrowed&#xD;
by- trials, were radiant with benevolent good-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
"Miust I decide," saidJosephine. "My young&#xD;
friend here would enjoy the luxuries of your&#xD;
magnificent hotel, Madame de Valmont, but I&#xD;
fear-that he ratlier needs seclusion and rest. So,&#xD;
Captain Osmanli, I entrust you to the guaian-&#xD;
ship of my good American friend, Madame Wil-&#xD;
mot. The fair widow (whose acquaintance I&#xD;
see youhave already made) will doubtless be&#xD;
happy to receive you as a visitor, hereafter." -&#xD;
Madame de Valmont blushed, bit the end of&#xD;
her fan, and then casting a look of burning ten-&#xD;
derness at Osmanli, which made his pulse tingle,&#xD;
she p'outingly remarked:&#xD;
"The captain can elect."&#xD;
"cNay, nay," interposed Josephine. "Let him&#xD;
enjoy the quiet of Madame Wilmot's retired,&#xD;
apartment, for a few days, at least."&#xD;
Osmanli now entered into conversation with&#xD;
his hostess, and was not long in ascertaining that&#xD;
she was a lady of extensive information, coupled&#xD;
with strong, practical sense. When the guests&#xD;
began to depart, Osmanli offered his arm, 'and&#xD;
was escorting her to her carriage, when Madame&#xD;
de Valmont passed.&#xD;
"When you are rested and released," she ex-,&#xD;
claimed, in a merry tone of voice, "I shall be&#xD;
&#xD;
happy to see you at my residence. Come with-&#xD;
out ceremony. And now, good-night."&#xD;
The syren-like tones of the fascinating widow's&#xD;
dulcet voice rang in Osmanli's ears long after he&#xD;
had arrived at Madame Wilmot's comfortable&#xD;
home. She attributed his bstracted manner to&#xD;
the fatigues of his journey, and lost no time in&#xD;
installing him in a neat bed-chamber. There&#xD;
was nothing remarkable about the room, but no&#xD;
sooner was the young man left alone than his&#xD;
attention was arrested by a full-length portrait&#xD;
over the mantel-shelf. It represented a tall, vig-&#xD;
orous looking man, with prominent cheek-bones,&#xD;
and long, black hair. The eyes were small, yet&#xD;
piercing, and the open countenance, which was&#xD;
gf a peculiar copper hue, bespoke an energetic&#xD;
mind, fitted for a high destiny. The costume&#xD;
a species of uniform, to which was added a&#xD;
ecklace of eagle's claws, and in the belt was a&#xD;
polisfied steel hatchet, of a peculiar form. That&#xD;
iirsaportrait of some one belonging to a na-&#xD;
ti  o(which he was ignorant, Osmanli felt con-&#xD;
vinced, yet he could not account for the strange,&#xD;
fascinating influence which it exercised over him.&#xD;
The eyes appeared to follow him around the&#xD;
roomaund eveiaf$&amp;amp;thl light was extinguished,&#xD;
he fancied that hecotddee that stern counten-&#xD;
ance, endeavoring to read is thoughts.&#xD;
Norwould this haye been an easy task. Up&#xD;
to that very evening, Judith Fezenzac had been&#xD;
the undisputed sovereign of every ide, Each,&#xD;
pure thought that flowed into his heart, ebbed&#xD;
forth impressed with some recollection of her.&#xD;
But now, the soft yet queenly languor of Jose-&#xD;
phinud had brightened the dark shadows left by&#xD;
the parting interview in the garden at Cairo.&#xD;
And Madame de Valmont, entering at the breach&#xD;
thus made in his constancy, had fascinated the&#xD;
unsophisticated young Moslem by her Circe-like&#xD;
wiles,&#xD;
Little thought the ensnared dreamer, as.he&#xD;
tossed about on his restless couch, that the bea-&#xD;
tiful enchantress who had to speedily woven a&#xD;
charm around his existence, was, at that moment,&#xD;
concocting plots of the most sanguinary nature.,&#xD;
Fortunate is it, that an everwise Providence often&#xD;
keeps us in happy ignorance of events which&#xD;
control our destiny. Impious is the hand :that&#xD;
would raise the veil, and seek to enter the mys-&#xD;
,terious portals of omnipotence.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7475-00000015"/>&#xD;
the strong arm of justice to the prison-some to&#xD;
the scaffold.&#xD;
Yet Madame de Valmont, with unconstrained&#xD;
step and eagle eye, hesitated not to penetrate this&#xD;
labyrinth of iniquity, and was soon in the midst&#xD;
of the vilest haunts, where the abandoned of both&#xD;
sexes hide their wretchedness and their guilt.&#xD;
She stopped before a house, over the door of&#xD;
which wa   a lantern, bearing the inscription;&#xD;
" cheap lodgings." A rapid glance assured her-&#xD;
that she was not followed, and drawing her&#xD;
cloak closely around her, she entered. The soli-&#xD;
tary lamp, almost extinguished by its own en-&#xD;
crustations, disclosed a small bar-room, but its,&#xD;
only occupant was a gaunt waiter, who was sit-&#xD;
;ting in a chair, fast asleep. He was not awak-&#xD;
ened by the gentle tread or the rustling silk of&#xD;
Madame de Valmont, and she was evidently in&#xD;
no want of his attendance. Evidently familiar&#xD;
with the locality, she passed -through the tar-&#xD;
room, into an inner, unventilated apartment.&#xD;
There lay a score of miserable wretches, nestling&#xD;
in piles of foul straw like so many wild beasts--&#xD;
the-atmosphere was warm and sickefing, and&#xD;
the -walls were damp with the dew of death.&#xD;
All was stamped with vice, save a young child,&#xD;
that peacefully -eposed by the side of a bloated&#xD;
woman, whose many finger rings and gold chain&#xD;
denoted the mistress of the establishment. Sweet&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MA&#xD;
flower, blooming into life, to be choked and with-&#xD;
ered by the flt around! Could it not find de-&#xD;
liverance from the poets who musically sung of&#xD;
human feeling-of the priests who preached the&#xD;
religion of mercy-of the philanthropists who&#xD;
collected money for the sorrows of the poor-of&#xD;
the sentimental whose hearts were touched with&#xD;
tales of woe ? No. A life of sin, and of shame,&#xD;
and of misery, is marked out for it, and the&#xD;
proud lady passes it with a scowl wrinkling her&#xD;
Parian brow.. Alas, alas! It is her own'child!&#xD;
Passing the fruit of her unlicensed indulgence&#xD;
without even a kind look, or a repentant sigh,&#xD;
the hard-hearted mother entered a third room,&#xD;
fitted up as a kitchen. Here she knocked four&#xD;
times against the wall-the signal was soon re-&#xD;
sppnded to, and then the entire back of the large&#xD;
fireplace revolved, disclosed a vaulted passage.&#xD;
A man of herculean proportions, -armed to the&#xD;
teeth, suddenly stepped out into the room, and&#xD;
said:.&#xD;
"Long live the Bourbons !"&#xD;
"Death to liberty I" was Madame de Val-&#xD;
mont's reply, and she then inquired, "is the&#xD;
count within ?"&#xD;
The sentinel answered in the affirmative, and&#xD;
Madame de Valmont -immediately entered the&#xD;
secret passage. After carefully closing the door;&#xD;
the sentinel lighted her down a long-flight of&#xD;
steps, at the foot of which was a strong iron door.&#xD;
There was another interchange of signals, afte&#xD;
which this barrier was opened, and disclosed a&#xD;
large hall. The roof showed that it was exca&#xD;
vated from the solid rock, but the sides wer&#xD;
lined with human bones; carefully arranged pileE&#xD;
of muskets .and sabres occupied one end of thi&#xD;
sepulchral apartment, and at the other end wa&#xD;
an altar, arrayed with the symbols of the Romisi&#xD;
faith, the largeowax candles dimly illuminatin&#xD;
the whole scene. In one of the corners near th&#xD;
altar was a'table, thickly strewn with papers, a&#xD;
which a young man sat writing. He was in th&#xD;
prime of life, with expressive gray eyes, silke&#xD;
black hair and beard, and a determined, resolute&#xD;
countenance. Rising as Madame de Valmon&#xD;
'approached, he handed her a chair, with a grace&#xD;
.ful manner indicative of good breeding.&#xD;
"Welcome to our stronghold, fair conspirato&#xD;
we have good news."      .&#xD;
"And a horrid place to tell it in. I don&#xD;
mind the cut-throats up stairs, but these cats&#xD;
combs have such a dismal look."&#xD;
"WOuld that the bones of Louis-the.Sixteen$&#xD;
and Marie Antoinette -ha&amp;amp;~ been as respteetfull&#xD;

CII4PTER IX&#xD;
STIOINcHOLD OF CONSPIRATORS.&#xD;
&#xD;
MADAME DE VALMONT, on'leaving the Bonn.&#xD;
part house, ordered her coachman to drive to the&#xD;
cathedral of Notre Dame. As divine worship&#xD;
had not been re-established since its overthrow&#xD;
by the revolutionists, the domestic thought this&#xD;
a strange command. But his mistress, as he&#xD;
well knew, would not be questioned as to any&#xD;
caprice of her untrammelled will, so he drove to&#xD;
the cathedral. By a curious contradiction, the&#xD;
vilest purlieus of Paris are shadowed by this gor-&#xD;
geous gothic fane, and even at the present day,&#xD;
as it was then, thousands of God's- children riot&#xD;
in vice ani degradation within the sound of-its&#xD;
pealing organ. Crowded into high tenements,&#xD;
these degraded wretches are packed, story above&#xD;
story, like so many oysters. Infants are reared&#xD;
in these hot-beds of crime, or die in the dark&#xD;
scenes of their birth, like plants which are&#xD;
sprouted in a tomb, and draw their brief exist-&#xD;
enee from- corrupting bones. There, in an at-&#xD;
mosphere so deprived by use of vitality that the&#xD;
lamps flicker with ghastly pallor, plans are laid&#xD;
for unlawful and desperate deeds, Fnd 'there,&#xD;
when successful, the villains share their ill gotten&#xD;
gains. There, hunger is often without food-&#xD;
hearths are often without fire-sickness is often&#xD;
without a bed-and while some perish by the&#xD;
knife of the assassin, or others put a sacrilegious&#xD;
end to their guilty lives, many are dragged by&#xD;
&#xD;
MWELUEE.                                 88&#xD;

"Thanks, count.   Ishould not complain.&#xD;
Now for your news I"&#xD;
"I knew that the loyalty of a de Valmont.&#xD;
would even overlook the horrors of the cata-&#xD;
combs. 'The news is this. That zealous Epg-&#xD;
lishman, Colonel Lowe, is at the island of Rhodes,&#xD;
with several allies. By the next arrival, we&#xD;
may hope to hear that Bonaparte is.aisassinated&#xD;
-and then-huzza for France and our legitimate&#xD;
king I As it was, the Corsican would have been&#xD;
killed at the battle of the Pyramids, had he not&#xD;
made some'mystic sign to a young Mameluke&#xD;
who was about to cut him down. Pest-but&#xD;
they became sworn friends, and the young Mos-&#xD;
lem came in the packet which brought my letters,&#xD;
to watch over Madame Josephine."&#xD;
" Ay, count," said the lady, " all this I know,&#xD;
and I hope to make this same Manmeluke, Cap-&#xD;
tain msmanli, one of our agents in the holir cause&#xD;
of r estoration."&#xD;
" You know him already, then ?"&#xD;
" Certaitily. Did I not tell you, when Isigned&#xD;
your pledge with blood from my veins, that I&#xD;
t would work with zeal T"&#xD;
" True. And you have done the cause good&#xD;
service. Between ourselves,, though, fair lady,&#xD;
f I think you are animated more by a desire to re-&#xD;
venge yourself on Bonaparte than-"&#xD;
r "Not upon him, countI No, no ! Not upon&#xD;
him, for I once loved him. But my revenge is&#xD;
- directed against that wily Creole, Josephine."&#xD;
e   " And you desire to see the Bourbons again in&#xD;
s power, at the same time ?"&#xD;
s   "Bourbons-anybody-but I would cheqk the&#xD;
s star of Josephine in its ascendant."&#xD;
h "And this young Mahometan ?"&#xD;
g "Is just the object for a true woman to love.&#xD;
e Masculine and regular in limb and feature, with&#xD;
t a bold, flashing eye, a clear lip, and an entire&#xD;
e absence of prettiness, he is one of nature's noble-&#xD;

e that her jealous Corsican has sent him to iyatch&#xD;
it over her doings, will evidently try to ensnare&#xD;
- him, but I will woo the young eaglet from her&#xD;
wiles, or sacrifice him."  Then, looking at her&#xD;
r, watch,' she continued: "But it is getting late,&#xD;
and my cotchinan may get into difficulty if day-&#xD;
't break reveals. his rich livery."&#xD;
a-   "Perhaps, madame, yet this is not, the first&#xD;
time you have been in the haunts above ground."&#xD;

"Iertiinly. And now, good-day."&#xD;
Te count escorted his visitor to the door,&#xD;
wherthey parted with ceremorfious salutations&#xD;
moreworthy of a palace than a charnel-house.&#xD;
Hastily ascending the steps, Madaine de Val-&#xD;

rapidly passing through the lodging-house, she&#xD;
walked to her carriage. The driver was fast&#xD;

It was very dari, for daybreak ias atiand,&#xD;
and as the horses started forward; it was impos-&#xD;
sible to see a foot bMfore one's face. Throwing&#xD;
herself back into a coiner of the 'carriage, the&#xD;
bold cdspirator rejoiced in the goodbeprlking of&#xD;
her vengeance. And what darling passion ven-&#xD;

eternal salvation: Such is vengeance. Such was&#xD;
the secret fountain which fed the reservoir within&#xD;
Madame de Valmont's heart, and moved the&#xD;
machinery of her every action. The hoped-for&#xD;
result was the disgrace of Josephine Bonaparte,&#xD;
and as the proud beauty reposed in the corner of&#xD;
her carriage, her imagination painted her Creole&#xD;
rival crushed and despised.&#xD;
But the dream was suddenly interrupted. The&#xD;
triumph-imaginary as it was-was of brief di-&#xD;
ration. A word rang in the ear of,the guilty&#xD;
sc'emer, and in an instant her imaginary triumph&#xD;
faded into ashes--her exultant joy sank into&#xD;
hopeless terror. And that word was&#xD;
"'2ella 1"&#xD;
It was her own name ! It was spoken in the&#xD;
orriagte where she bad fancied herself alone!&#xD;
It was pronounced in a well-known tone!&#xD;
She flhieked frantically to her cadhman, lbut&#xD;
he'heard'het not, fbr sleep had-possessio -of his&#xD;
&#xD;
the terrified woman saw a well known figure on&#xD;
the front seat.&#xD;

"Yes, my pretty Zelia, it is I. I am just&#xD;
from Egypt--in' disguise-a disgraced, ruined&#xD;
man, thirsting for revenge. Business carried&#xD;
me first to the Count de Vergennes, and I little&#xD;
thought that the fine lady who entered as-I left,&#xD;
was you. But the sentinel so informed me, and&#xD;
finding your carriage here, I quietly took a seat&#xD;

of the swifk-revolving wheels drowned her voice.&#xD;
Thenpshe heard those well remembered tones&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"Zelia. Be-quiet !"&#xD;
We have said that Madame de Valmont was&#xD;
a'widbw-a wealthy widow, who revelled in the&#xD;
dissipations of the French metropolis; but we&#xD;
must now lift the veil from her past life. Anl&#xD;
orphan, educated in a convent, she had attracted&#xD;
the notice of Monsieur de Valmont, a rich banker,&#xD;
who acted as financial agent to the iunse. Of&#xD;
course, when 'he asked her hand, it was given&#xD;
him, and thelpoor girl found herself, at a tender&#xD;
age, the miistress of a noble mansion. For a&#xD;
while, ter husband idolized her, but graduany&#xD;
he returned to his old associates, and his wife&#xD;
found hdself deserted for the society of opera-&#xD;
dancer and adventurers. Then, when her heart&#xD;
was wounded and lonely, she met Bonaparte, a&#xD;
simple officer of artillery, but gifted with the&#xD;
qOalities which her imagination had painted.&#xD;
Young, talented, affectionate, he soon won her&#xD;
heart without knowing it, and when he did'sus-&#xD;
pect it, -he at once avoided her society. Again&#xD;
the "poor woman was alone-uneared for-un-&#xD;
loved. Then came another officer, beneath&#xD;
whose fascination she fell. For a while, her hus-&#xD;
band, intent upon his own pleasures, did not&#xD;
suspect his wife's ipfidelity.' But, lured on by&#xD;
her gay deceiver, she soon -forgot herself, and&#xD;
when Monsieur de Valmont's eyes were opened,&#xD;
it was too late.&#xD;
Then, and not until then, did she ascertain her&#xD;
husband's affection, and her deceiver's unworthi-&#xD;
ness. The latter, having received a post\ in the&#xD;
staff of Bonaparte (now general), coolly threw&#xD;
off the weeping woman who ha'a sacrificed all&#xD;
for him, and laughed when she recalled his vows.&#xD;
But the husband-the wronged, confiding -hus.&#xD;
band, when he heard of her desertion, sought&#xD;
her out, restored her to her conjugal rights, and&#xD;
showed a disposition to forget the past. Just&#xD;
then, death called him home. His widowia.&#xD;
herited his fortune, and with her recollections -of&#xD;
his forgiving kindness was blended a hatred of&#xD;
the man who had made her unworthy of it.&#xD;
There was a jealousy, too, of Josephine, who&#xD;
-h4eaptivated-her heart's first love.&#xD;
"8peak, 2elia, you must know me."&#xD;
Was it a dream 'i No I Just then, the ear;.&#xD;

lum, and assistance. Who is more bound to&#xD;
give it me than Zelia de Valmont, the companion&#xD;
of former days-the mother of my child !"&#xD;
BveWy word fell like molten lead upon the&#xD;
brain of the poor woman, who-so suddenly&#xD;
found herself dependent before the will of a man&#xD;
whom she despised.&#xD;

&#xD;
was made happy by her unobtrusive cheerful-&#xD;

her pure and generous spirit. Her personal ap-&#xD;
pearance was very attractive. The features were&#xD;

the eyes fervent and mellow, and a general&#xD;
sweetness diffusing itself over the whole coun-&#xD;
tenance, indicative of the highest moral and in-&#xD;
tellbetual cultivation, qualified by a nature of the&#xD;
tenderest-benevolence.&#xD;
Osmanli soon loved her devotedly, not. with&#xD;
that deep, pure and holy feeling which can link&#xD;
youth with age. Her excellence stole upon his&#xD;
heart, like the light of -a balmy summer's mnorn&#xD;

that he persuaded the commandant of the garri-&#xD;

cabin vanished like a fairy palace. And mean-&#xD;
while the sail-trimmers had been busy algft,&#xD;
reeving preventer slings, lashing the boarding&#xD;
nettings, and, making everything secure.&#xD;
At first, the strange craft evidently endeavored&#xD;
to escape, but, with her disproportionate sails,&#xD;
she could not evade the "Republique."  All at&#xD;
once, when the distance between the vessels had&#xD;
diminished to about half a mile, the light sails&#xD;
of the . cutter were taken in, and the courses&#xD;
hauled up.&#xD;
To the French captain, the cutter had been a&#xD;
mystery, owing to her peculiar rig, and he had&#xD;
taken every precaution, lest there should be some&#xD;
stratagem concealed in the beautiful hull. He&#xD;
now politely requested Judith and her teacher to&#xD;
retire below, where they would be out of danger.&#xD;
Then, gettingin all his light sail, he fired an&#xD;
unshotted gun.&#xD;
Let us now see what was going on aboard the&#xD;
other vessel, which was the Albatross, re-fitted&#xD;
at Rhodes, and on her way to England with de-&#xD;
spatches from Lord Nelson. Jack Norman,&#xD;
when the French brig first hove in sight, saw&#xD;
that it would be impossible to escape, and he&#xD;
laid a desperate plan of action. His crew num-&#xD;
bered thirty men, fierce, desperate fellows, most&#xD;
of them old imugglers, who now saw that im-&#xD;
plicit obedience was their only hope of escape&#xD;
from a French prison.&#xD;
While his opponent was preparing to capture&#xD;
him by a coup de main, Norian had his hands&#xD;
busily occupied in flooding the magazine, and&#xD;
then spiking the starboard guns. Those on the&#xD;
larboard side were loaded with grape shot, and&#xD;
a man stood by each, with spike and hammer,&#xD;
ready to disable it for action in a moment after&#xD;
it had discharged its death-dealing contents.&#xD;
Every man had his boarding cutlass at his side,&#xD;
pistols in his belt, and a pike at hand.&#xD;
On came the French brig, her bulwarks crowd-&#xD;
ed with men, and passing under the stern of the&#xD;
Albatross, he rounded to, and threw out his&#xD;
grap*ls. Another moment, and as the yards&#xD;
of the two vessels clanked together, the brig&#xD;
towering over the cutter as if to crush her, Nor-&#xD;
man's clear voice shouted:&#xD;
"Fire ! Then away 1'&#xD;
And the blaze was followed by the crash of&#xD;
shot, entering the planks of the Frenchman, and-&#xD;
echoed by shrieks.&#xD;
"IAvancez!" shouted the French captain, and,&#xD;
followed by the unharmed of his crew, he leaped&#xD;
e board the Albatross.&#xD;

But he found no enemy to combat. Norman,&#xD;
followed by his crew, had boarded the French&#xD;
vessel by- the stern, as her crew left the bows,&#xD;
and immediately began to cast off the grapnels.&#xD;
The astonished Frenchmen, the moment they&#xD;
comprehended their error, endeavored to return&#xD;
to their vessel, but in vain. Norman and his&#xD;
resolute crew, havingmastered the few on board,&#xD;
were able to defend the side, and the vessels&#xD;
soon surged apart. Then, manning the guns,&#xD;
the delighted Englishmen poured broadside after&#xD;
broadside into their late craft, which the French&#xD;
were vainly endeavoring to get before the wind.&#xD;
But the cut rigging and spiked cannon showed&#xD;
so plainly that they were victims of a cunning&#xD;
plan, that the French crew refused to work. In&#xD;
vain did the captain urge and then threaten them.&#xD;
Their courage, their hope, their confidence in&#xD;
him were gone.&#xD;
Maddened to desperation at the sight of his&#xD;
fine vessel sailing proudly away from him, whilst&#xD;
his crew refused to aid in recovering her, the&#xD;
French captain left the deck. A few moments&#xD;
more, and a lurid flame gleamed up through the&#xD;
hatchways of the cutter, followed by cries of de-&#xD;
spair and agony, for the Frenchmen saw that one&#xD;
of two dreadful deaths was inevitably to be their&#xD;
lot. The flames burned with terrific brilliancy,&#xD;
and it was easy to see by the heavy rolling of&#xD;
the cutter that she was water-logged. At length&#xD;
the flames reached the magazine, and although&#xD;
the powder had,been flooded, the explosion sent&#xD;
up a huge column of fragments-then, all was&#xD;
still. The French captain had buried himself&#xD;
and his disgrace in a watery grave. Norman&#xD;
hove to, and lowered a boat, but every man had&#xD;
perished.&#xD;
Judith, immured below, had plainly heard the&#xD;
din of the tumult. The tearing and splintering&#xD;
of the cutter's broadside-the collision of the two&#xD;
vessels-the sharp report of small arms, as the&#xD;
French boarders were repelled from their own&#xD;
vessel-and then the terrific explosion. All had,&#xD;
in turn, heightened her fears, while her poor&#xD;
teacher, upon his knees, vowed offerings to half&#xD;
the saints in the calendar in casebf deliverance.&#xD;
At last, all was quiet again, and then the wel-&#xD;
come form of the cabin-boy was seen descending&#xD;
the ladder.&#xD;
" Ah ah !" exclaimed the teacher, "all is well,&#xD;

STRANGE AND SAD TABLEAUX.&#xD;

WINTER enveloped Paris with his snowy man- ing through stained glass windows, partially ob-&#xD;

42                               THE MA&#xD;
Step by step, Osmanli's pure heart melted be-&#xD;
fore the bright glances of his enchantress; nor&#xD;
was it long before he became a convert to the&#xD;
Epicurean doctrines which lull the Parisians to&#xD;
repose, as they float down the current of pleasure.&#xD;
War,, love, wine, music, pleasure and opium,&#xD;
are looked upon as so many drugs, each produc-&#xD;
ing a different effect, but each as fit for indul-&#xD;
gence as the others.&#xD;
One evening, Mdadame de Valmont called in&#xD;
her carriage for Osmanli, and took him to a&#xD;
masked ball, atthe Grand Opera House. The&#xD;
spacious pit was floored over on a level with the&#xD;
stage, and upon the large area revelled thou-&#xD;
sands of maskers, intoxicated with wine and joy.&#xD;
Seen from one of the boxes, which Madame de&#xD;
Valmont had engaged, the floor appeared like a&#xD;
vast cauldron, where wild folly was fomenting,&#xD;
throwing out from its borders a foaming noise,&#xD;
and sending up to the overhanging chandeliers&#xD;
a mist of warm breath. The imperious notes of&#xD;
the orchestra pealed above the general clamor,&#xD;
the sharp tones of post-horns coming in clearly&#xD;
from time to time, as - one sees the flash of can-&#xD;
non through the thickest of the smoke. Thou-&#xD;
sands of lights seemed to flicker in joyous time&#xD;
to the music, casting a lurid glance upon the&#xD;
multitude of gay costumes below, as ever chang-&#xD;
ing as the, hues of the kaleidoscope. Each eye&#xD;
had a wink-each mouth a cry-each arm a&#xD;
mocking gesture-each form a provoking move-&#xD;
ment. The floor trembled under the pattering&#xD;
of indefatigable feet, and a more compact, parti-&#xD;
colored mosaic of humanity cannot be imagined.&#xD;
Hark! 'The leader of the orchestra gives the&#xD;
signal for the commencement of the gallop. A&#xD;
sort of heaving takes place in the thick waves at&#xD;
the firstnotes of the post-horn,acurrentis gradual-&#xD;
ly established, and soon the triumphant gallopade&#xD;
sweeps around the area. In the centre, those&#xD;
makers who did not join in the diabolical round&#xD;
formed stagnant groups-human islands which&#xD;
remained stationary. The whirlpool around them&#xD;
hastened and leaped onwards. A charge of cav-&#xD;
alry sweeping down upon a square of infantry&#xD;
could not make a louder or heavier noise, and&#xD;
Osmanli was remindedof the impetuous hordes&#xD;
of Mourad Bey. Circling like a maelstrom, it&#xD;
was a symbol of the evolutions of humanity,&#xD;
which sweep individuals into irresistible masses.&#xD;
As the night wore on, Osmanli and his com-&#xD;
panion left their box, and joined the promenaders&#xD;
in the saloon of the theatre. Here, everything&#xD;
was decorous and mysterious. No gentlemen&#xD;
&#xD;
MELUKE.&#xD;
were admitted in disguise, but every lady was&#xD;
masked, and so concealed by a black domino&#xD;
hood, as to render recognition next to impossi-&#xD;
ble. Madame de Valmont, who was in her ele-&#xD;
ment, spoke to several gentlemen, and intrigued&#xD;
one or two by her knowledge of their love affairs.&#xD;
All at once Osmanli started, for the well known&#xD;
tones of Judith Fezenzacfell upon his ear. Could&#xD;
it bepossible ? He eagerly surveyed the masked&#xD;
forms around him, but could not distinguish&#xD;
any one that could be her, and soon the thought&#xD;
was chased from his mind, by the bewitching&#xD;
folly of his wild-hearted companion.&#xD;
Yet it was Judith's voice that he had heard.&#xD;
She had arrived at Paris, with a broken&#xD;
and a sad heart, but Josephine, receiving her&#xD;
into her house, endeavored to dispel her grief.&#xD;
When she had subdued the poor girl's outward&#xD;
sorrow, she begaeto question her as to the state-&#xD;
of her heart, and only that morning Judith had&#xD;
confessed that Osmanli, above all other men,&#xD;
had won her love. "Poor girl," thought Jose-&#xD;
phine, "another hope is to be disappointed ;"&#xD;
but she refrained from telling her that the young&#xD;
Mameluke had been entranced by a designing&#xD;
woman. And she had persuaded her to attend&#xD;
the ball, in the hope that it would divert her&#xD;
mind. They had not entered, however, ere they&#xD;
saw the enraptured Osmauli, and an exclama-&#xD;
tion involuntarily escaped from Judith's lips.&#xD;
" Hush!" whispered Josephine. "I would&#xD;
not for worlds be recognized, especially by the&#xD;
demon who accompanies your faithless lover.&#xD;
But now you see why he has not called upon&#xD;
me, and why he has forgotten his duty; let us&#xD;
go to the police-box. You shall, ere morning,&#xD;
administer a pointed rebuke to your feeble-hearted&#xD;
swain. After all, poor fellow, perhaps he can-&#xD;
not help it."&#xD;
Never was there a more truthful supposition.&#xD;
Bewildered by the blaze, deafened by the noise,&#xD;
and entranced by the music, Osmanli lost all&#xD;
self-command. And when tlte adroit plotter&#xD;
against his happiness left the gay scene with&#xD;
him, to partake of supper at a neighboring res-&#xD;
taurant, he was completely in her power. ' The-&#xD;
house was crowded, but the keeper had one pri-&#xD;
-vate room disengaged, and they at once took&#xD;
possession of it. It was not large, and at one&#xD;
end were folding-doors, which apparently com-&#xD;
municated with an adjoining room. A sumptu-&#xD;
ous supper was soon served, and, when all was&#xD;
ready, and the domestic had left the room, Ma-&#xD;
dame do Yalmont said: -&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MAM&#xD;
&#xD;
I4&#xD;
&#xD;
"And to whom ?" asked Madame de Val-&#xD;
mont, drawing herself up with queenlike dignity.&#xD;
" To Fouche-to Madame Bonaparte. Pity-"&#xD;
"Pity you, you-but.her, never. Traitress&#xD;
that she is, will she ever thwart my projects ?"&#xD;
"Yes, madame !" said a voice at their sides.&#xD;
It was the unmistakeable voice of Josephine!&#xD;
Both sprang ~to their feet, and saw, with aston-&#xD;
ishment, that the folding-doors were thrown&#xD;
open. And there, encircled by police officers,&#xD;
stood Madame Bonaparte, her eyes flashing fire I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Now, dear Osmanli, I will take off this mask&#xD;
about which you have grumbled so much."&#xD;
Never did the sun, after a total eclipse, beam&#xD;
forth with such brilliancy as did -that matchless&#xD;
creature, when she threw off her disguise.&#xD;
Dressed in the scanty ball toilet of the times,&#xD;
which displayed the classical development of her&#xD;
form, and left her fine arms bare to the shoulder,&#xD;
she appeared to Osmanli like some visitor from&#xD;
fairy land. A collar of blazing diamonds decked&#xD;
her beautifully moulded bust, and never did a&#xD;
sparkling river wind over a fairer bed. Nor&#xD;
could the enraptured young man gaze upon her&#xD;
pure complexion and her classical features, with-&#xD;
out thinking that he saw that loveliness which&#xD;
Phidias sculptured-the Parian marble marvel-&#xD;
lously animated by the fire of life.&#xD;
Filling glasses to the brim with pearl-mantled&#xD;
champagne, she pledged Osmanli again and&#xD;
again, merely sipping the wine herself, while he&#xD;
drained his every time. Then, with flashing&#xD;
eyes, she continued her remarks in such a tone,&#xD;
and with such allusions as inflamed his imagina-&#xD;
tion. Ecstasy surcharged every part of his soul's&#xD;
faculties, and rapturous joy sent his heart's blood,&#xD;
by forced marches, joyfully parading through his&#xD;
frame. At last conversation ceased. Osmanli's&#xD;
heart heaved convulsively, and his noble nature&#xD;
at last prompted him to avow his deceit. Throw.&#xD;
ing himself at her feet, he confessed his love, his&#xD;
worship, his adoration-but regretted his un-&#xD;
worthiness.&#xD;
"Unworthy? No! dearest Osmanli !" was&#xD;
the reply, in syren tones, and the crafty wotuan&#xD;
leaned her downcast head upon one of her ex-&#xD;
quisitely tapering arms, the glossy fringe of hei&#xD;
long drooping eye-lashes falling upon her cheeks,&#xD;
and Contrasting deeply with the light blushe&#xD;
that rose to meet them.&#xD;
"0, forgive me !" said Osmanli, in heart.&#xD;
touching tones. "Forgive me. But I am bul&#xD;
a base, degraded spy, who has agreed to betra:&#xD;
you.-"&#xD;
&#xD;
BLURE.48&#xD;
"Yes, madame 1 can thwart your diabolical&#xD;
plans, and, with God's help, I will. This is no&#xD;
place for a scene, but I will tell you that, over-&#xD;
hearing a part of your conversation at the opera,&#xD;
whither I went to distract a young friend, I de-&#xD;
termined to sound the depths. of your infamy.&#xD;
Feeling certain that you would sup, I had in-&#xD;
structions sent to all the neighboring restaurants,&#xD;
and let you have gone where you would, I&#xD;
should have been a listener. Henceforth, dare&#xD;
not show your guilty countenance where I am,&#xD;
and remember that the police will watch your&#xD;
every movement. As for you, Captain Osmanhi,&#xD;
a glance at my companion, who, like myself has&#xD;
been a witness of your infatuated treachery, will&#xD;
perhaps recall you to your senses. And as Os-&#xD;
manli raised his eyes, Madame-Bonaparte lifted&#xD;
the hood of her trembling friend. It was Judith&#xD;
Fezenzac, and 0, what an reproachful look of&#xD;
sorrow beamed from her expressive eyes.&#xD;
Another moment, and the folding doors had&#xD;
been closed, leaving the guilty couple 'alone-&#xD;
again.&#xD;
'Maledictions upon her heid," muttered Ma-&#xD;
dame de Valmont, her features worked into a&#xD;
furious expression of hatred. I will yet be re-&#xD;
venged. Come, Osmanli, call for the bill, and&#xD;
let us leave this den of spies."&#xD;
Mechanically and without a word, Osmanli&#xD;
settled with the host, called a carriage,- and&#xD;
handed in his companion. Then, closing the&#xD;
door of the vehicle, and unmindful of the calls&#xD;
of the now frightened woman, he walked away&#xD;
at a rapid pace.&#xD;
On-on he strode! Now jostling those whom&#xD;
he met-now stepping aside into the gutter, in&#xD;
order to pass those who occupied the narrow&#xD;
sidewalks, and were too tardy in their move-&#xD;
ments for his excited frame. Penetrating into&#xD;
the midst of the mighty labyrinths of stone and&#xD;
mortar, he did not pauseuntil he reached the&#xD;
old bridge across the Seine, near the cathedral&#xD;
of Notre Dame.&#xD;
It was a tempestuous night, the rain falling in&#xD;
torrents, and the winds howling through the&#xD;
.arches of the bridge with a voice of lamentation,&#xD;
to which the gurgling water responded as it&#xD;
rushed along. Stopping when over the centre&#xD;
arch, Osmanli leaned over the parapet, and gazed&#xD;
into -the foaming waters beneath. Joy, fierce&#xD;
and thrilling, now animated his heart, for peace&#xD;
lay in the eddying whirlpool into which he gazed,&#xD;
as it whirled around its dimp-d centre, like the&#xD;
hawk circling around its distant prey, contract-&#xD;

&#xD;
and Osmanli, raising his head, again looked&#xD;
around.&#xD;
" Where am I?" he inquired. "A tomb-&#xD;
human bones-weapons-and, and, 0 enchant-&#xD;
ress, have you followed me into another world,&#xD;
to again ruin my happiness ?"&#xD;
"Be tranquil, my brother," said the count, in&#xD;
a gentle tone. Then he rang a bell, and a ser-&#xD;
vant appearing, he ordered him to show the&#xD;
boatmen the-way to his bed-room, for a portion&#xD;
of the catacombs had been fitted up with every&#xD;
comfort. Hither Osmanli was to be carried,&#xD;
then divested of his wet clothes and put to bed.&#xD;
" Are you mad ?" asked Madame de Valmont,&#xD;
her beautiful features convulsed with rage.,&#xD;
"MadI Do you call it madness, madame, to&#xD;
rescue a human being from destruction-espe-&#xD;
cially when that individual is bound to you,by a&#xD;
mystic tie ?"&#xD;
" Well, sir count, if you harbor spies, and en-&#xD;
courage our enemies, it will be a long time ere&#xD;
the Bourbons return to France."&#xD;
But what can I do,under the circumstances ?"&#xD;
"What can you do ?" shrieked the infuriated&#xD;
woman, almost delirious with rage. " Why, let&#xD;
me have the craven, and I will send his head to&#xD;
Josephine -Bonaparte as a keepsake, while the&#xD;
fishes shall feast on his treacherous heart.&#xD;
Wretch that he-"&#xD;
" Silence, madame," interrupted the count.&#xD;
"Such lanj~uage cannot be tolerated here, nel-&#xD;
&#xD;
other can your private wrongs interfere with the&#xD;
cause-a cause which recognizes Christianity."&#xD;
"Perdition take your cause, and your besotted&#xD;
Bourbons. I only used you as a tool to'gratify&#xD;
my revenge against Josephine Bonaparte, but&#xD;
now I leave you to your new associate. Ha!&#xD;
ha! The elegant Count de Vergennes and a&#xD;
renegade spy! Adieu. I leave you to play the&#xD;
host." And the desperate woman left the vault.&#xD;
" She will not dare betray me," murmured the&#xD;
count, and he then repaired to the  ouch where&#xD;
he had ordered Osmanli to be laid. He had re-&#xD;
covered from the effects of his immersion, but&#xD;
the count restrained his-thanks.&#xD;
"You now need repose," he said, "and we&#xD;
will converse hereafter. That I am your friend,&#xD;
you know; nor is it necessary to tell you that&#xD;
you are in a portion of the catacombs of. Paris.&#xD;
To-morrow I will tell you more. Adieu, and&#xD;
pleasant dreams to you."&#xD;
Would that Osmanli could have slept, but it&#xD;
was out of the question. Hour after hour he&#xD;
tumbled about upon his couch, with the sound of&#xD;
the rushing waters ringing in his ears, and no&#xD;
air to breath. Choking, he seemed to descend,&#xD;
then to rise again, gasping for breath. And&#xD;
Madame de Valmont, with a smile on her lips,&#xD;
would then again precipitate him into the watery&#xD;
abyss. At last he closed his aching eyes, and&#xD;
sank, exhausted, into troubled repose.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nnws from France reached Egypt, informing&#xD;
Boniaparte that the moment was at hand when,&#xD;
by casting granite-like edicts upon the moving&#xD;
sands of revolutionary misrule, he could lay the&#xD;
foundations for an imperial throne. Making&#xD;
hasty and secret preparations, lest his design&#xD;
should be suspected by the English fleet then&#xD;
hovering off the coast, the victorious general re-&#xD;
embarked for France. Fortune favored her war-&#xD;
like son, and after a speedy passage, through&#xD;
tempests and hostile fleets, he arrived at Frejus,&#xD;
a small town on the coast, not very far from&#xD;
Marseilles. Quarantine regulations were set at&#xD;
defiance, and the decks of his ships were soon&#xD;
crowded with civil and military functionaries,&#xD;
who shouted "Hurra for Bonaparte and victory!&#xD;
we prefer the plague to Austrian invaders."&#xD;
Even the wounded soldiers left their hospital, to&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
i&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
welcome him as he landed;and the entire popu-_&#xD;
lation greeted him as the only man who could&#xD;
restore stability and concord to a distracted na-&#xD;
tion. The church bells rang forth joyous peals,&#xD;
the cannon roared, bands of martial music were&#xD;
harmonious in their glad strains of welcome.&#xD;
But Bonaparte was indifferent to all these mani-&#xD;
festations of devotion. Poison had adroitly been&#xD;
mingled in his cup of happiness, and the sorrow&#xD;
he felt more than counterbalanced his ambitious&#xD;
pride.&#xD;
&#xD;
Madame do Valmont, influenced by the curl&#xD;
osity of her sex, was so eager to hear with what&#xD;
success Colonel Lowe was pursuing his diaboli-&#xD;
cal plans, that when she feared to remain longer&#xD;
in Paris, she repaired to Marseilles. A few&#xD;
mornings after her arrival, a courier came from&#xD;
Frejus, and reported Bonaparte's arrival from&#xD;
Egypt. Starting at once, she arrived just as the&#xD;
conqueror landed, and managed to have a note&#xD;
handed to him, in which she accused Josephine&#xD;
of having transferred her affections.to his brother&#xD;
Joseph. The note concluded thus:&#xD;
"As proof of what I have asserted, you will&#xD;
find, on arriving at Paris, that the guilty couple&#xD;
have fled; upon what pretence I cannot say.&#xD;
But I know that your guilty wife will not dare&#xD;
to face you, and that she boasts that it is only&#xD;
the first burst of your stormy passions which she&#xD;
&#xD;
dreads.&#xD;
&#xD;
A DEVOTED FRIEND." .&#xD;
&#xD;
Need it be wondered at that the jealous hus-&#xD;
band was in haste to arrive at his home, although&#xD;
he endeavored to persuade himself that it was a&#xD;
miserable invention. The official ovation with&#xD;
which he was received on landing seemed to oc-&#xD;
cupy an age, and it was with difficulty that the&#xD;
authorities of Lyons detained him one day.&#xD;
"FasterI faster I" was his oft-repeated exclama&#xD;
&#xD;

tion, and the smoking wheels of his carriage&#xD;
whirled over hill and dale with greater speed&#xD;
than those of many a modern locomotive. In&#xD;
vain did the rural population line the road, with&#xD;
shouts of gladness, and offerings of gratitude.&#xD;
A rapid glance was all they could obtain-a&#xD;
passing bow was all the return for their display.&#xD;
Yet they murmured not, but hailed him as the&#xD;
rising suan, which was to dispel the long night of&#xD;
national gloom.&#xD;
Onward! onward! The olive groves of Pro-&#xD;
venee-the vine-clad fields of Rurgundy-the&#xD;
forests of Fontainbleau-all were passed as one&#xD;
sees a quick moving panorama. And at last,&#xD;
seated in its natural amphitheatre, Paris appears&#xD;
in sight. It was a bright morning, and the sun,&#xD;
which flashed from the graceful.domes of the&#xD;
Pantheon and the Invalides Chapel, cast dark&#xD;
shadows behind the massive towers of Notre&#xD;
Dame and of Saint Jacques. There, in the cen-&#xD;
tre of the civilized world, had the conqueror&#xD;
hoped to plant his future seat of empire. There,&#xD;
on a locality rich and rare in historical assecia.&#xD;
tions, had he hoped to found a dynasty that&#xD;
would overthrow the present, and overshadow&#xD;
the past. A dynasty that would gleam like the&#xD;
salient domes before him Upon the pages of his-&#xD;
tory, and would cast the reigns of Charlemagne,&#xD;
and Clovis-the Bourbons and the Valois-far'&#xD;
into the shade. But now,- no such ambitious&#xD;
projects-occupied histhoughts. All the sway&#xD;
he coveted was over one heart. Was his Jose-&#xD;
phine true to him, or had she fled to hide her&#xD;
blushes of shame? -&#xD;
He reached the gateway of his residence, and,&#xD;
ere the porter could recover his surprise at see-&#xD;
ing his master thus hurriedly return, Bonaparte&#xD;
was in the house. All was quiet, Hastening&#xD;
up stairs into his wife's room, he found it empty,&#xD;
and, worse thanthat, bearing marks of having&#xD;
been recently left. Drawers had been emptied,&#xD;
tse travyelling trunks were gone and the unhappy&#xD;
husband felt his worst fears confirmed. The&#xD;
bell summoned a domestic.&#xD;
" Where is Madame Bonaparte'?"&#xD;
"She left early this morning, general, in great&#xD;
haste."p&#xD;
" Alone "&#xD;
"No, general, your brother Joseph accompa-&#xD;
nied her."&#xD;
A groan forced itself from the' heart of the&#xD;
wretched husband, and he motioned the aston-&#xD;
ished servant to withdraw. Substantial happi-&#xD;
ness was now fully exchanged for sicky doubt,&#xD;
&#xD;
the soft light of trusting affection was obscuied,&#xD;
and jealousy held possession of his every sense.&#xD;
Ordinarily, his powerful will controlled any dis.&#xD;
play of jealousy; but now, his whole frame was&#xD;
convulsed; the "green-eyed monster," like a&#xD;
barbaric horde, overwhelming all that was ex-&#xD;
cellent in his character. Any other blow he&#xD;
could have borne up against-his philosophy.&#xD;
would have borne him up under the weight of&#xD;
any other affliction. But his strickeni heart&#xD;
writhed in anguish, beneath the grinding thought&#xD;
that she in whom heahad centered every joy, had&#xD;
turned from him to a preferred rival. And that&#xD;
rivl, too, was a brother-one against whom he&#xD;
could not draw a sword. Beaded drops of agony&#xD;
studded his forehead, and ineffable anguish was&#xD;
depicted on every feature.nu&#xD;
There was-a gentle tap at the door, but Bona&#xD;
parte heard it not. Twice was it repeated, and&#xD;
then the door opened, but the sorrow-stricken&#xD;
man saw not who entered. And it was not until&#xD;
he felt a gentle pressure upon his arm that he&#xD;
looked up. Seeing a female form, he at first&#xD;
thought it was Josephne, and he clenched his&#xD;
teeth with rage. But he gave a look, and saw&#xD;
Judith Fezenzac, more beautiful than ever, al-&#xD;
though her cheeks wore that delicate pallid hue&#xD;
which is so closely imitated by Powersrin his&#xD;
matchless statue of the Greek Slave. Clasping&#xD;
his hand in hers, she said, in a confiding,.gentle&#xD;
tone&#xD;
They told me that you had arrived alone,&#xD;
and thinking you would feel disappointed at not&#xD;
receiving a welcome from your loving wife, I&#xD;
ventured to intrude."&#xD;
"ButJosephine -n"&#xD;
"Has gone to meet you."&#xD;
"To meet meeWhy, my nightingale, that&#xD;
is impossible, for I have heralded my approach&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
"No indeed, general. About daybreak this&#xD;
morning a-lady rang at the gate., and said that&#xD;
an officer had*arrived, bringing news that fou&#xD;
had arrived at FreJus. He also had a written&#xD;
request from you that Madame and your brother&#xD;
Joseph would leave at once for Orleans, to meet&#xD;
you. By an aceient his carriage was over-&#xD;
turned, and he had not only lost the missive,.&#xD;
but had, received .such 'an injury that he could&#xD;
only reach her house, and she had brought the&#xD;
lette-."&#xD;
"And did Josephine credit this falsehood"&#xD;
'I Creditit, general ?" continued Judith; " why&#xD;
she was ovejoyed to think that you had thus&#xD;

first greetings away from-the -public gaze." s&#xD;
The door opened, and a-lady entered.  -&#xD;
"Dearmother I" exclaimed-Bonaparte  how&#xD;
kind of you to come thus to greet me."&#xD;
"Welcome to France, my son," said Madame&#xD;
Bonaparte, and as she took of her bonnet, Ju- t&#xD;
dith could scarcely credit that she was the mother&#xD;
of thirteen children. Her majestic figure re- &#xD;
tained its early grace,, her passionate dark eyes 1i&#xD;
were undimmed,, and age had. left few traces&#xD;
upon her symmetrical countenance. "Welcome t&#xD;
to France, my son I I have hastened to meet&#xD;
you, because some one left at  y house this t&#xD;
morning an anonymous note, informing me that&#xD;
Josephine had behaved improperly, and had gone&#xD;
off to escape your anger, so I was advised to I&#xD;
come and recommend you to discard her."&#xD;
"And you do, mother'?"&#xD;
"Not I, Napoleon, not I! Light hearted sheI&#xD;
may be-volatile she may be-fond of gayety she&#xD;
may be-but she is as true to you, -my son, as&#xD;
the moon to.the sun."&#xD;
Some one knocked-General Bonaparte open-&#xD;
ed the door, and was delighted to see Fouche.&#xD;
After cordial greetings, the cunning police-agent&#xD;
asked, with a smile:&#xD;
"Is it customary in Egypt, general, to have a&#xD;
lady precede you on a journey ."&#xD;
" Sir !" said Bonaparte, in a frigid tone, for&#xD;
he thought it was an allusion to his wife.&#xD;
"10 nothing, general. But the reports from&#xD;
the south show that a lady of fashion took post-&#xD;
horses at Frejus an hour after you landed, and,&#xD;
fast as you afterwards travelled, she reached the&#xD;
capital nearly a day in advance of you."&#xD;
"And who was this female Mercury'!"&#xD;
" Madame de Valmont. I don't know, but I&#xD;
fear she is getting herself into difficulty, and&#xD;
will yet seethe inside of a prison." i&#xD;
"Have you your letter, mother?~" inquired&#xD;
Bonaparte.&#xD;
Here it is, my son," replied Madame Bona-&#xD;
parte, and she soon handed him -the epistle.&#xD;
The general took from his pocket that which he&#xD;
had received at Frejus, and handed both to&#xD;
Foucho.&#xD;
What do you think of these notes!"V .I&#xD;
"Think, general,  Why the first glance tells&#xD;
me that they were written by the same person,I&#xD;
6n paper from the same ream, and, see, each is&#xD;
sealed with a signet ring bearing the letter V,.&#xD;
Now " (and he toolca third letter from his coat-&#xD;
pocket), "here is aletter written in the same hand,&#xD;
&#xD;
n the same kind of paper, and stamped with the&#xD;
ame seal. But this is sighed, plainly enough,.&#xD;
de Valmont.'&#xD;
"Therefore, my old'flame wrote all."&#xD;
Exactly, general, and preceded you here."&#xD;
Stepping across the room, Bonaparte pulled&#xD;
he bell-rope with such force that it broke. When&#xD;
he servant responded to the summons, he sent&#xD;
'in-for the porter. That functionary was not&#xD;
ong in arriving, and was questioned thus:&#xD;
" Was it you who received a message early&#xD;
this morning Vi&#xD;
hIt -was,general," and the domestic quailed&#xD;
before the iron glance of his interrogator.&#xD;
"And who was the lady ?"&#xD;
The porter turned crimson, then pale, and his&#xD;
lips moved without sound.&#xD;
" One question, general, if you please," said&#xD;
Fouche. "Tell me, fellow, how much did she&#xD;
give you "&#xD;
" A golden twenty-five, franc piece, sir."&#xD;
"0, ho 1" exclaimed the wily police agent.&#xD;
"That was liberal in Madame de Valmont, was&#xD;
it not .'&#xD;
The poor follow sank on his knees. "Forgive&#xD;
me, general," he cried;    knew not that Idid&#xD;
harm. The lady was evidently vexed that I&#xD;
recognized her, and she begged me to keep si-&#xD;
lent, for she did not wish it known that the officer&#xD;
who brought the message was at her house. I&#xD;
had no idea-"'&#xD;
"Never mind, my good fellow,". interrupted&#xD;
Bonaparte, "your ideas are of little value. This&#xD;
once I forgive you, but never have any secrets&#xD;
again, even if you do receive gold."&#xD;
" Plague take the gold," murmured the man,&#xD;
as he bowed himself out, "I will see it changed&#xD;
into good wine without delay."&#xD;
" By the way," inquired Bonaparte, "where&#xD;
is Captain Osmanli?~"&#xD;
Judith turned pale, but Fouche responded,&#xD;
and informed the general how the young man&#xD;
had been led from his'duty. During his recital,&#xD;
Bonapare rose from his chair, took snuff vehe-&#xD;
mently, and when the story was concluded&#xD;
with the abrupt disappearance from the ball, he&#xD;
exclaimed:       41&#xD;
. "Poor fellow,poor fellow. Hark ye, Monsieur&#xD;
Fouche, your police spying is all very fine, but I&#xD;
never wish you to enlist my officers in it. They&#xD;
have other duties."&#xD;
" You shall be obeyed, general," answered&#xD;
the obsequious agent, whose sagacity foresaw&#xD;
Bonaparte's coming power. "Nevertheless, I&#xD;

thought-that this Captain Osmanli came here on&#xD;
rather an inquisitive mission."-&#xD;
"Brigand I" said Napoleon, with a smile,&#xD;
"nothing escapes you., Butis not that a carriage&#xD;
I hear entering the court-yard'?"&#xD;
A moment more, and Maddme 1Bonaparte,&#xD;
who had just left the room, re-entered, leading&#xD;
Josephine. Never did the faultless symmetry of&#xD;
form, and the classic features of the bewitching&#xD;
Creole appear to greater advantage. The jour-&#xD;
ney had animated the languor of her complexion&#xD;
with a roseate hue, and one glance from her&#xD;
flashing eyes melted away her husband's doubts,&#xD;
&#xD;
as the last fall of snow disappears before the&#xD;
warm sunbeams of spring.&#xD;
"Welcome home !"&#xD;
"Thanks, thanks, my dear wife. You have&#xD;
been duped, and I have been miserable; but how&#xD;
can I doubt you, when I see all the truth of your&#xD;
innocent heart reflected from your loved counte-&#xD;
nance." And opening his arms, the conqueror&#xD;
pressed Josephine to his heart, and wept.&#xD;
Every one else left the room, for the scene was&#xD;
too sacred for mortal eyes to witness. From&#xD;
that moment, his 'Wife became his confidant. He&#xD;
recognized her as a guardian, angel, and submit-&#xD;
ted to her guidance.&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
ANk ttNEXETED  ziTElRUPTIOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
BoNAPAnTE had not ,passed many days in&#xD;
Paris, ere he was looked to by all as the man&#xD;
who should seize the helm of state and pilot the&#xD;
vessel of state into more peaceful waters. The&#xD;
enthusiastic reception with which he had been&#xD;
received showed the tone of national feeling, and&#xD;
he became forcibly impressed with the necessity&#xD;
of speedily accomplishing his long thought of&#xD;
plans. To deliver France from the domination&#xD;
of unprincipled factions, to surround'her with a&#xD;
glory which should surpass even that of ancient&#xD;
Rome, and to make himself the arbiter of her&#xD;
destinies, was the great and worthy object of his&#xD;
ambitious thoughts.&#xD;
Retiring to a beautiful country-seat, named&#xD;
Malmaison, which Josephine had purchased dur-&#xD;
ing his absence, he kept perfectly tranquil, but&#xD;
began to cautiously fathom the men who were&#xD;
to be selected as subordinate actors in the ap-&#xD;
proaching drama.' Meanwhile his political plans&#xD;
were actively going forward, through the active&#xD;
instrumentality of his few initiated friends, and&#xD;
most of' the superior officers wore engaged to&#xD;
support him. The rest, he well knew, would&#xD;
follow their leaders, and Atchanically act in&#xD;
obedience to the impulse imparted to them.&#xD;
The volatile Farisians, however, grumbled&#xD;
loudly at the seclusion of their idol, and one&#xD;
evening Bonaparte suddenly decided' to gratify&#xD;
&#xD;
them by appearing in public, and at the same&#xD;
time to fulfil a long-given promise. The next&#xD;
morning, while the residents of Malmaison were&#xD;
breakfasting, the papers arrived from  Peris&#xD;
Bonaparte and Josephine glanced eagerly at the&#xD;
political news, but Judith, wedded to her art,&#xD;
looked at the musical intelligence.&#xD;
Was it a dream? She sat, looking intently&#xD;
at the paragraph as if entranced, until Josephine&#xD;
read from the journal she was perusing?&#xD;
" We understand that General Bonaparte will&#xD;
haflor the opera with his presence on Monday&#xD;
eveniflg next, to assist at the debut of Mademola&#xD;
selle Judith rezenzac, a young vocalist of rare&#xD;
merit, who has come from the East under him&#xD;
patronage."&#xD;
" Ah ha!" said Bonaparte. "tDid I not tell&#xD;
my nightingale that I should soon applaud her&#xD;
performances. Don't look so frightened, Judith,&#xD;
we have each to make our bow before the public/&#xD;
and we must put stout hearts upon the matter,&#xD;
The manager will soon be here, and will take&#xD;
you into the city for rehearsal."&#xD;
"Kind, generous man I" exclaimed Judith@&#xD;
"Amid all your varied. occupations, you have&#xD;
,thought of the poor orphan, an4-"&#xD;
"And," interrupted. Bonaparte, "here come&#xD;

&#xD;
and get ready. Should you feel timid on Mon-&#xD;
day evening, remember that in my dictionary&#xD;
there is no such word as fail."&#xD;
Great was the demand for tickets, and long&#xD;
before the doors of the opera house were opened&#xD;
on the appointed evening, the adjacent streets&#xD;
were thronged with brilliant equipages, hackney&#xD;
coaches, and curious pedestrians. At last the&#xD;
hour came, and soon every part of the house&#xD;
was crowded. The boxes were filled with ladies&#xD;
in full dress, proud in the consciousness of sur-&#xD;
passing loveliness, and expecting not only to be&#xD;
enchanted by the debutante, but to enchant oth-&#xD;
ers by their charms. In the pit were the critics,&#xD;
their faces sharpened by expectation of the new&#xD;
prey within their grasp. And all over the house&#xD;
were right-worthy citizens, with their portly wives&#xD;
and their blushing daughters, eager to see the&#xD;
patron of the night. All present evidently con-&#xD;
sidered him as one upon whose expression hung&#xD;
the fate of the nation; "a look where men might&#xD;
read strange matters."&#xD;
At last a prolonged roll of the drums without&#xD;
was heard, but the clang of the martial salute by&#xD;
the guard was soon drowned by repeated cheer-&#xD;
ing. Again and again shouts were heard-they&#xD;
dame up the staircase-they echoed'through the&#xD;
lobby. Within the house a deathlike silence&#xD;
reigned, 'but -when the door of the reserved box&#xD;
was opened, and Bonaparte appeared, loud&#xD;
shouts of welcome rang from pit to dome. The&#xD;
orchestra, inspired with the prevalent enthusiasm,&#xD;
struck up the Marseilles Hymn, and nearly all&#xD;
present, as if frantic with joy, joined in its in-&#xD;
spiring chorus.&#xD;
. The object of this boisterous homage received&#xD;
it unmoved. Advancing to the front of his box,&#xD;
he bowed thrice, and then stood calmly, with&#xD;
folded arms, surveying the brilliant scene before&#xD;
him. He wore the simple costume of the Insti-&#xD;
tute of' Sciences, his long, chestnut hair fell upon&#xD;
his shoulders, and his dark blue eyes gave ani-&#xD;
niation to his sun-browned countenance, over&#xD;
which thought had cast an interesting shade.&#xD;
By his .side, a few paces in the rear, however,&#xD;
stood Josephine, dressed to perfection, and wear-&#xD;
ing a tiara of diamonds as sparkling as her wit.&#xD;
She seemed to- give herself up to the illusioti of&#xD;
the moment, and to enjoy the regal homage paid&#xD;
to her warrior lord.&#xD;
The-overture was at length performed, the&#xD;
curtain was drawn up, and Judith entered,&#xD;
dressed in-a becoming peasant dress. Loud as&#xD;
&#xD;
was the applause which had greeted Bonaparte,&#xD;
it was re-echoed when the audience saw in the&#xD;
new candidate for their favor such exquisite and&#xD;
perfect beauty.  The Parisians love female&#xD;
beauty, and were entranced by Judith's exquis-&#xD;
itely proportioned figure, the classical loveliness&#xD;
of her intellectual countenance, the glowing bril-&#xD;
liancy of her eyes, shaded by their luxuriant&#xD;
lashes. Every charm embodied by pencil or&#xD;
chisel seemed united, and as she advanced to the&#xD;
foot-lights, her eyes fixed upon her protector,&#xD;
she captivated all hearts.&#xD;
The success thus commenced, changed into a&#xD;
regular frenzy of applause when her voice elec-&#xD;
trified the house with its sparkling tones. Clear&#xD;
and brilliant as diamonds, her notes charmed the&#xD;
senses, and were rendered with a spontaneous&#xD;
emotion seeming to emanate from her very soul.&#xD;
Suddenly, and some thought it a part of the'&#xD;
opera, an old man, with a staff in his hand,&#xD;
rushed upon the stage. His face was meagre&#xD;
and pale, a grizzled beard hiding the lower part&#xD;
of it, while the strongly-marked Israelitish fea-&#xD;
tures denoted his race. No sooner did Judith&#xD;
see him, than she ceased-singing, and, crossing&#xD;
her hands upon her breast, she sank upon her&#xD;
knees. But the intruder, with relentless grasp,&#xD;
seized her by the shoulder - one of those&#xD;
moulded shoulders which had been so much&#xD;
admired.&#xD;
"Judith," said he, in an angry tone, "why, 0&#xD;
why do I find thee in this place of abomination i&#xD;
Is not the cup of thy people full, that thou join-&#xD;
est in such heathen mummeries., which will ever&#xD;
exclude you from the eternal Zion ? Arise, and&#xD;
go -hence 1"            .    .       '&#xD;
Meekly, and without a word, the poor girl&#xD;
obeyed her father. The cup she had -so long&#xD;
and so earnestly desired to taste, was snatched&#xD;
from her lips, and her soul, which had just begun&#xD;
to soar in the realms of triumph, sank into the&#xD;
abyss of despair. The audience were electrified&#xD;
by this unexpected incident, and loudly stigma.&#xD;
tized the intruding father.  Then the mana-&#xD;

For years-have I nursed you, ab a tender floWer,&#xD;
with simple, anxious care. For years I-watcheo'&#xD;

"Father I" sobbed Judith, sinking on her&#xD;

Israel listen to me, and curse me if I speak,&#xD;
falsely. -.Here on my knees do I confess my&#xD;

After Bonaparte had gone. the exasperated&#xD;
manager came, evidently thinking that by offer-&#xD;
ing large sums of money he could move the ol&#xD;
man's heart. But all his tempting offers were&#xD;
refused, and he followed them to the door with&#xD;
mingled entreaties and denunciations.&#xD;
Taking a coach, Mordecai and Judith went to&#xD;
the house of a distant kinsman, where the former&#xD;
was sojourning. The main apartment was fitted&#xD;
up in true Hebrew style, a magnificent seven-&#xD;
branched chandelier, of solid silver, illuminating&#xD;
the rich damask curtains and velvet covered&#xD;
furniture. - Here Judith was welcotfied by some&#xD;
of her own people,. and treated as a returned&#xD;
prodigal. At last, they retired, and then, in the&#xD;
solitude of her chamber, she thought over the&#xD;
events of the evening. The fluctuating waves of&#xD;
faces at the opera house, the intoxicating homage&#xD;
of applause, the sudden apparition of her father,&#xD;
the thrilling scene, the terrific lecture in her&#xD;
dressing-room-all passed like summer clouds&#xD;
across her fevered spirit, and a fearful re-aetion&#xD;
commenced.&#xD;
The next day, after a disturbed sleep, she be-&#xD;
gan to realize that all her prospects had faded,&#xD;
and a dark pall enveloped her musical hopes.&#xD;
Yet, conscience comforted her with approving&#xD;
voice. What would success, or applaqss, be to&#xD;
her, if her father was miserable'I And she offered&#xD;
up her powers of song, a willing sacrfice, upon&#xD;
the'altar of filial love,&#xD;
Madame Bonaparte came to see her every&#xD;
day, and soothed her with angelic assiduIg.&#xD;

&#xD;
ON the morning of Madame Wilmot's return,&#xD;
Osmanli awoke, again'to find himself incarcer-&#xD;
ated in his sepulchral dungeon. He had dreamed&#xD;
-dreamed of the happy hours passed at Cairo,&#xD;
and Judith, pure as an angel of light, had prom-&#xD;
ised him that she would see his mother. But&#xD;
now, as even the recollection of his vision faded&#xD;
awaybefore the sunlight of reality, the image of&#xD;
her whom he loved gave place to that of Ma-&#xD;
dame de Valmont. Her artful wiles-her syren-&#xD;
like smile, and her fiendish look when Josephine&#xD;
surprised them at the masked ball-all were em-'&#xD;
bodied in his imagination into a demon, that&#xD;
haunted him perpetually, and embittered his few&#xD;
pleasant thoughts.&#xD;
The cathedral clock toned eight, and for a&#xD;
moment interrupted his agony of thought. Then&#xD;
the awful silence was broken by approaching&#xD;
footsteps, and soon the door creaked on its rusty&#xD;
hinges. A .key grated in the lock, and then a&#xD;
man entered. He was dressed as #*ater-carrier,&#xD;
although his well patched suit of cotton velvet&#xD;
had not' the cleanly look peculiar to that class.&#xD;
His long hait fell id uncombed masses over an&#xD;
unshaven face, and his eyes gleamed with rage.&#xD;
"Your servant, Captain Osmanl, he ex-_&#xD;
claimed, in mocking tones. "You may not rqc-&#xD;
olleet this form, wasted by bearing a proscribed&#xD;
life, like that of a wild beast, nor may this mis-&#xD;
&#xD;
erable garb resemble my onee brilliant uniform.&#xD;
But," and the speaker's voice trembled with all&#xD;
the. vehemence of ungoverned passion, "you&#xD;
cannot forget that you have a long account to&#xD;
settle with me-me, the maan whose love you&#xD;
crossed-whose prospects you ruined, apd *hef'&#xD;

gry who has a right to control Madame de Yal-&#xD;
mont's heart-the fugitive from justice wlio has&#xD;
found your lair, and demands satisfaction for all&#xD;
the wrongs you have done him."&#xD;
Osmanli, for the first time i his life, trexbled,&#xD;
A horrid mist seemed to rise around him, from&#xD;
which glowed the furidus' and angering face of'&#xD;
his unmercifhl enemy. '-lnrecovered fro&amp;amp; the&#xD;
effects of his rash attempt at suicide,'he kxew&#xD;
that he could have but little chance in a struggle&#xD;
with one who, a single glance sufficed to show,&#xD;
was endowed with full vigor, and whose'features&#xD;
bore the fearful impress -of deadly wrath. He&#xD;
pressed his hands to his eyes, to shut' ont the'&#xD;
hateful vision, and to bring back his scattere'&#xD;
senses.&#xD;

±5tnt xL .i&#xD;
&#xD;
ani play the woman. Here are two swords-&#xD;
take one, and we can soon settle our difieglties."&#xD;
The gallant Mameluke gasped for breath; his&#xD;
heart beat-thick and fast, and he endeavored to&#xD;
rise, but was forced to grasp the post of his bed&#xD;
for support.    I&#xD;
"Trembling coward !" exclaimed Margry, in&#xD;
a contemptuous tone. "Would that the fair&#xD;
Jewish friend of General Bonaparte were here.&#xD;
tb witness the pusillanimous bearing of her che.&#xD;
valier."I&#xD;
This taunt inspired Osmanli with his wonted&#xD;
daring; the veins in his forehead swelled, and&#xD;
casting a look at, Margry which was so deadly&#xD;
defiant that it seemed to scorch even his heated&#xD;
soul, he shouted:&#xD;
"Maniac!I traitor! Give me a sword, and&#xD;
defend your craven person."f&#xD;
Margry, immediately drew two swords from&#xD;
a rolled up cloak which he had brought, and&#xD;
offered one to Osmanli, who -clutched it franti-&#xD;
cally. An instant more, and they were engaged&#xD;
in deadly combat. OsmanU was an adept with&#xD;
the weapon, and ere the swords were fairly&#xD;
crossed, he felt that he was in no danger from&#xD;
the mad thrusts of his infuriated enemy. But&#xD;
he jdged it best to act wholly upon, the defen-&#xD;
sive, and steadily endeavored to disarm his op-&#xD;
ponent. The moment came, but no sooner did&#xD;
Mrgry feel his sword forced from his grasp,&#xD;
tbau with a howl of rage, like that of an infuri-&#xD;
ated tiger, he drew a pistol. But, at that mo-&#xD;
ment, a powerful handseized his arm, the muz-&#xD;
zle of the weapon was averted from Osnyanli,&#xD;
and the ball went through a door opposite to the&#xD;
usual entrance.&#xD;
An unearthly scream echoed the report, and&#xD;
Margry, with a horror-struck look, rushed out of&#xD;
the room. Osmanli, whose unnatural strength&#xD;
deserted him the moment, it was no longer re-&#xD;
quired, sank upon his bed again, and saw with&#xD;
delight his guardian, the Count de Vergennes.&#xD;
"owis this ?" exclaimed the count. "Did&#xD;
this scoundrel presume to attack you in your&#xD;
defenceless couditioni"&#xD;
" He did:' replied Osmanli, "and for the drst&#xD;
time in my life, I knew what it was to fear; but&#xD;
go    did not, desert me, and I-heavens!&#xD;
W ice is tht*"  ..&#xD;
The coint also head the noise which had, at-,&#xD;
tratpd Osmanli's attention. It was a stiged&#xD;
co          froi   hind thedoor which. the&#xD;
piqtbah      A pverso4, It was )oeked within,&#xD;
butth comatwreeed gt open, asd, to the eur-&#xD;
&#xD;
prise of both, Madame de Valmont staggered&#xD;
into the room, and sank upon the floor. She&#xD;
was dressed in white, and a crimson tide of blood,&#xD;
flowing from a wound in her side gave her a&#xD;
fearful look.&#xD;
" Mercy, mercy !" she exclaimed, in a tremu-&#xD;
lous voice. "Curse me-hate me,'but 0, for-&#xD;
give me I"&#xD;
The count, aided by Osmanli, placed the un-&#xD;
fortunate woman on ,the bed, and the former,&#xD;
summoning an attendant, despatched him up to&#xD;
the hospital abqve them, for a surgeon and a&#xD;
sister of charity. When the good nun arrived,&#xD;
he requested Osmanli to accompany him into&#xD;
another room.&#xD;
" Listen," said he. "I rescued you from&#xD;
death as a fellow-mortal. I have cherished you&#xD;
as a brother, to whom the 'mystic tie' binds&#xD;
my heart. And I had hopes that I could enlist&#xD;
you into our cause-a cause which involves the&#xD;
welfare of our nation, nay, of all Christendom.&#xD;
But I learn to-day from one of my spies who is&#xD;
connected with the police department, that active&#xD;
inquiries are being made for you by-"&#xD;
"By whom ?" interrupted Osmanli..&#xD;
"Your mother !"&#xD;
"Thank God-thank God!" exclaimed the-&#xD;
young man, in s toneof Iuch reverential grati-&#xD;
tude that for a moment the count did not inter-&#xD;
rupt the prayer that evidently ascended from his&#xD;
heart. He then went on.&#xD;
"Yes, Osmanli, your mother is now seeking&#xD;
you, an before-her visit to the metropolis, anx-&#xD;
ious inquiries were-made by General-Bonaparte,&#xD;
and by a wealthy Sm yrniote Jew, one Mordecai&#xD;
Pezeuzac."&#xD;
"Thefather of Judith," murmured Osmanli,&#xD;
and then the blush of shame mantled his brow.&#xD;
" Count!" said Madame de Valmont, "listen.&#xD;
to me. I feel the damp dews of death on my&#xD;
brow, and wish to make some. reparation to one&#xD;
victim of my wicked heart. , Will you promise&#xD;
me that, ere the sun goes down to-night, youwill&#xD;
have Madame Bonaparte assured that I, insti-&#xD;
gated by a spirit of jealous revenge, seduced this&#xD;
young- man from the paths of duty. Promise&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"I promise, madame," said the count. Then&#xD;
turning to Osmalll, "Now, captain,. you must&#xD;
retire. -To-night I will take you from this char-&#xD;
nel-house,eng place you among brethren."&#xD;
Then, pointing to, the door, ihe escorted Os-&#xD;
ianli into the large hall just as the surgeon and&#xD;
sister of chariy approached the chalinerwhere&#xD;
&#xD;
56&#xD;
&#xD;
reposed the suffering, peniteht and sad Madame&#xD;
d6 Valinonti&#xD;
That same evening, when darkness had cast&#xD;
ier welcome veil on, all above ground, the count&#xD;
came for his pi-otege." "Madame(de Valmont, he&#xD;
informed him, was recovering from the effects of&#xD;
her wound, but he could find no traces of Mar.&#xD;
gry, wh was'probably in possession, of know-&#xD;
lodge of some other entrance to the catacombs.&#xD;
Osmanli, meanwhile, had put on a new uniform,&#xD;
brought by the attendant,. aid, when he was&#xD;
ready, the count escorted him to the subterranean&#xD;
opening leading to the river,, where a boat was&#xD;
in waiting. Two sturdy oarsmen sent them rap-&#xD;
idly, yet noiselessly along the river, the count,&#xD;
who sat at the helm, keeping the boat under the&#xD;
deep shadow of the huge stone quays. Passing&#xD;
the long gallery of the Louvre, the boat was'&#xD;
brought alongside the landing in front of the&#xD;
palace of the Tuileries. Here the count, fol-&#xD;
lowed by Osmanli, stepped on shore, and soon&#xD;
traversed the Palais Royal, then the focus of&#xD;
Parisian dissipation. In one of the narrow&#xD;
streets beyond the Palais, the count stopped at&#xD;
the door of rather a mean looking house, and&#xD;
knocked thrice. , They were immediately ad-&#xD;
mitted, and the count led the way up stairs, into&#xD;
a large, plainly furnished room. At one ex-&#xD;
tremity of this room was a large double door,&#xD;
studded with iron knobs, before which stood a&#xD;
,man armed with a drawn sword.&#xD;
I seek admittance from my brethren within,&#xD;
S formyself and my.companion,"-said the count.&#xD;
They who seek aright ever find," was the&#xD;
laconic reply of the sentinel. I&#xD;
The count knocked, and a voice from within&#xD;
asked;&#xD;
"Who waits without ?"&#xD;
,I, Henri de Vergennes," replied the .count,&#xD;
a worthy and well qualified brother, conduct-&#xD;
ing one whose rights are equal to mine own."&#xD;
"Who is this strange brother 1"&#xD;
"Captain Osmanli, of the Egyptian wind,&#xD;
that bloweth freely, yet sendeth good towards&#xD;
the East."&#xD;
Do you, Henride Vergennes, vouch for his&#xD;
worthiness I"&#xD;
"With all my heart; he is true, faithful, and&#xD;
discreet."&#xD;
"Will he prove brave, silent, affectionate 1" &#xD;
" Yes-to every engagement.",&#xD;
Then a deeper toned voice was heard, saying:&#xD;
"Strife, and cruelty, and discord reign upon&#xD;
&#xD;
the earth, fet there is refuge for the oppressed.&#xD;
The promised blessing'exists, and here 'thdre is&#xD;
peace and joy for the brotbrhoqd-o mystid tie&#xD;
unitig'us all in bonds of love. .From all parts&#xD;
of the globe thewinds blow, but they all convey&#xD;
good towards the East, and all recognize one&#xD;
Grald Architect, who' alone- can re-construct&#xD;
man's ruined heart. Then let the Egyptian&#xD;
brother enter. He comes from ,the fountain-&#xD;
liead of the Mystic rites-may hefind the stream&#xD;
here unpolluted. Let him enjoy those teremo-&#xD;
nies which are to-day as tliey will be to-morrow&#xD;
-which will be to-morrow as they were yester-&#xD;
day-which were yesterday as they always have&#xD;
been and ever will be."&#xD;
And scores of voices responded: "So mote it&#xD;
be."  The doors were thrown open. The senti-&#xD;
nel, stepping to one .side, presented arms, and&#xD;
the count, taking Osmanli by the hand, entered&#xD;
the hall.&#xD;
What transpired within those mystic portals,&#xD;
we cannot disclose. The veil is never lifted save&#xD;
to the initiated.&#xD;
Two hours passed. The doors were thrown&#xD;
open, and the brethren came out, chatting cor-&#xD;
dially together. Nor were any two apparently&#xD;
more interested in each other's society, than&#xD;
Mordecai Fezenzac and Captain Osmanli. The&#xD;
old Jew had been ovejoyed to meet with the&#xD;
preserver of his daughter's life, and he cheered&#xD;
Osmanli's heart with the information that Ma-&#xD;
dame Bonaparte had received the exculpating&#xD;
message sent by Madame de Valmont.&#xD;
"So come," said he, "and join us at the sup-&#xD;
per-table. I will warrant you a welcome from&#xD;
Judith, and you may find some one else who will&#xD;
be glad to. see you.'!..&#xD;
" Go, my friend," joined in the Count de Ver-&#xD;
gennes. "You had at any rate better not ap-&#xD;
pear in public until your name is taken from the&#xD;
official list of dead or- deserted, where it must&#xD;
have figured since your bath. I have asked a&#xD;
brother here, who is a clerk in the war depart-&#xD;
ment, to see that you are enregistered among the&#xD;
sick to-'morrow; but to-night, keep quiet. And&#xD;
now good-by.&#xD;
"Adieu, preserver and friend," replied Os-&#xD;
manli. "But can I not see you again ?"&#xD;
" Conspirators must be secret, in their move-&#xD;
ments. 0! 'tis a sad thingtopbe thus in arms&#xD;
against our own country, but the right divine, to&#xD;
rule must be sustained. At any rate, when you&#xD;
wish to see me, come to No. 17 ruelle de Notre&#xD;

To'wards morning, he restlessly turned his&#xD;

"Save me," he continued, at brief intervals;&#xD;
" save me, as you saved Judith ! Brother Os-&#xD;

Judith ! What was earth to her, now that her&#xD;
revered father was no longer living to counsel&#xD;
and guide her through its paths, even though&#xD;
they were. flowery and joyous.&#xD;
But she had but'a short time for melancholy&#xD;
contemplation, or for profiting by the cordial&#xD;
sympathy of Madame Wilmot. Justice, stern&#xD;
and implacable, demanded Her attendance at the&#xD;
inquest held on her father's remains, and, with&#xD;
a deep shudder at the idea of seeing the mur-&#xD;
derer, she repaired to the chamber of death.&#xD;
The justice of peace was there; and, his face&#xD;
buried in his hands, there sat the supposed crimi-&#xD;

But Can you imagine, sir, that .lst night, when,&#xD;
[first saw yon victim, when I hailed him with&#xD;
Joy, when my heart rejoiced at the idea of aging&#xD;
meeting his daughter? 0, think you that at&#xD;
such a moment I would dip my hands in his&#xD;
blood, and stab him life a ruffian? If you do&#xD;
,think so,.sir,.you know me not."&#xD;
"Your appeal is eloquent," said the justice,'&#xD;
"and if assertions could overbalance facts;,&#xD;
might acquit you. But the testimony implica-&#xD;
ted you so directly, that I must'order your im-&#xD;
prisonment, to answer a charge of wilful murder."&#xD;
No sooner did Madame Wilmot hear the ap-&#xD;
palling decision, than she burst into a flood of&#xD;
tears, and her loaded heart was thus relieved&#xD;
from a load of sorrow too mighty to be borne.&#xD;
Osmanli shuddered,'but drawing himself up, he&#xD;
replied, in a clear tone:&#xD;
"I submit. I bow before my fate. And&#xD;
should I be condemned to death, I shall walk&#xD;
fearlessly towards the guillotine, as a step to-&#xD;
wards a tribunal where all testimony ts known,&#xD;
and where no secrets are hidden." Then cast-&#xD;
ing a look of mingled agony and pity at Madame&#xD;
Wilmot, he continued k "As for you) my long&#xD;
sought mother, you find me as undefiled by this&#xD;
foul crime as I was when you first heard my in-&#xD;
fant voice. Pray for me, see me if you can, and,&#xD;
o do not let Julith curse me as her father's&#xD;
murderer. You, my heart tells me, do not ac-&#xD;
cuse me."       '&#xD;
"9Accuse you-P" exclaimed Madame Wilmot,&#xD;
in A tone of piercing anguish. "Can I think&#xD;
that the Almighty would restore my son, after a&#xD;
life-separation, with his hands red with the blood&#xD;
of him whose daughter he loved'? Never ! No,&#xD;
my noble-hearted boy, I will not desert jou-,&#xD;
My soul within me tells me that you are inno-&#xD;
'Cent, and that your name will never be branded&#xD;
with ignominy. One kiss, and then go to meet&#xD;
your fate like a man. You will see me often."&#xD;
And it was there, trroundedby armed guards,&#xD;
with the awful corpse before them in accusing.&#xD;
terror, that the mother embraced her son for the&#xD;
first time. Joy surcharged their hearts, and rap-&#xD;
turous love, unrestrained by fear of, the future,&#xD;
possessed their every faculty.&#xD;
They parted. Madame Wilmot, after a few.&#xD;
hurried words of comfort to the agonized Judith,&#xD;
hastened to see General Bonaparte, and Osmanli,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
heavily ironed, was conveyed to the old prison&#xD;
uear TotreDanie. is heart sank within him as&#xD;
he was .onyeyed along the gloomy corridor, and&#xD;
the door of his, cell creaked on its hinges, but, as&#xD;
he entered, the sergeant of his guard pressed his&#xD;
hand. 'It was the grasp of a brother, and his,&#xD;
sad thoughts were cheered by one word, spoken&#xD;
in a low tone 9f voice. That consoling, hope-&#xD;
inspiring word, accompanied by a mystic grasp,&#xD;
was:&#xD;
"tCourage I"&#xD;
And thi-oughout the long day, when the un-&#xD;
happy prisoner thought over the varied events&#xD;
of the preceding twenty-four hours, there came&#xD;
shining through the ,gloom-"courage."   It&#xD;
nerved his sad heart, and inspired him with hope.&#xD;
The faint light Which had penetrated through&#xD;
the thickly barred window at last grew dim, and&#xD;
as night came on, an awful stillness reigned in&#xD;
the prison, only interrupted by the deep tones of&#xD;
the neighboring cathedral bells,- as, they pealed&#xD;
forth the successive hours. At last, from sheer&#xD;
exhaustion, he fell asleep, and was awakened by&#xD;
the light of a lantern, held before his eyes.&#xD;
- " Hush I" whispered a strange voice, and sit.&#xD;
ting up upon his straw couch, Osmanli saw the&#xD;
sergeant who had inspired him with hope.&#xD;
"You don't remember me, comrade'?" whis-&#xD;
pered the soldier. "Never mind, but I remem-&#xD;
ber yqu. Saperlotte, as I told the boys, to have&#xD;
a comrade who had saved Napoleon's life ar-&#xD;
rested by the black-coats, and locked up like a&#xD;
pickpocket. In short, brother -Osmanli, the&#xD;
guard to-night are all from the grenadier corps&#xD;
which once surprised you near, Grand Cairo,&#xD;
After you had broken the 'little corporal's' sword.&#xD;
Besides, we are most of us bound to you by a&#xD;
'mystic tie '-so up, fellow, and march."&#xD;
Osmanli's thanks impulsively burst from his&#xD;
eyes in tears, but the soldier motioned to him to&#xD;
be silent, and to follow. They stepped out into&#xD;
the corridor, and the sergeant, after re-locking&#xD;
the doo, cautiously led the way, Osmanli fol-&#xD;
lowing.. In a few moments they reached the '&#xD;
guard-room, where a dozen stalwort fellows wel-&#xD;
comed their old Egyptian friend, and in a few&#xD;
moments he was completely uniformed, his long&#xD;
hair was reduced'to the regimental cut, and his&#xD;
whole appearance was so changed that none but&#xD;
the most practised eyes could have recognized .&#xD;
him.                             I&#xD;
"Bravo I" said the sergeant, when the cos-&#xD;
tume was pronounced perfect:   "Flints and&#xD;

SNever was there an escape better planned-&#xD;
never ,ras one more successfully carried out.&#xD;
And when, at an early hour the' next morning,&#xD;

prisoner they sought was not to be fid. Bona-&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIIL*&#xD;
PROCLAMATION OP THE REPUBLIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
TnE morning was cold and dreary, yet at an&#xD;
early hour all the general, officers in Pais were&#xD;
on horseback, on their way to the residence of&#xD;
Gfneral Bonaparte. Cavalcade after cavalcade.&#xD;
arrived, and were admitted into the court-yard,&#xD;
exciting the curiosity of a large body of specta-&#xD;
tors, who-could not divine what .was about to&#xD;
take place, No review had been announced, no&#xD;
festie preparations had been madeand yet every&#xD;
military man of note made his appearance, and&#xD;
followed his comrades into the court-yard. Mu-&#xD;
rat, with his long curls and gorgeous uniform-&#xD;
La Salle, with his honor-scarred cheek-Moreau,&#xD;
pale and thoughtft4-Andreossy, powerful as the&#xD;
brigade of dragoons whose uniforin he wore-&#xD;
Jourdan; the lion-hearted--Lefevre, the invinci-&#xD;
ble-all, in short, were there. All were in- full&#xD;
uniform, attended by their brilliant groups. of&#xD;
staff-officers, and as each cavalcade passed&#xD;
through the assembled populace,,its leader was&#xD;
cotmplimiented by allusions to his well known&#xD;
victories... Last of al, camea tall, fine looking&#xD;
man, in citizen's dress. It was Bernadotte, and&#xD;
hisAompressed lip betokened his disappointment,&#xD;
for hehad a presentiment that Bonaparte was&#xD;
about to do what ho had long wished ,others to&#xD;
do for himself. Power was to be concentrated,&#xD;
anda strong arm, wielding a good sword, was.&#xD;
to  d   rane.&#xD;
&#xD;
An hour passed, And the crowd without had&#xD;
swelled to thousands, when the sound of trum.&#xD;
pets checked the curious in their speculations,&#xD;
Three regiments of cavalry, the flower of the&#xD;
Paris . garrison, made their way through the&#xD;
masses, atid drew up in an adjacent boulevard.&#xD;
What their officers had been'ordered to do, the&#xD;
troopers knew not, but each man who was ques-&#xD;
tioned whispered that he had rations in his va-&#xD;
lise, and his holsters full of ball-cartridges for&#xD;
his carbine.&#xD;
Something was evidently on foot.&#xD;
A horseman came up at full gallop, and called&#xD;
upon the people to make way for a state mes-&#xD;
senger.&#xD;
"Where are you from ?" inquired a score of&#xD;
voices.&#xD;
"From the council now in session at the Tuil-&#xD;
eries," was the reply, "and I have a decree for&#xD;
General Bonaparte. -Let me pass." And as&#xD;
the massive gates closed after hinm, the wonder&#xD;
increased.&#xD;
Soon a shout was beard within: "Long live&#xD;
the Republic. ILong live Bonaparte ", The&#xD;
multitude without took up 'the cry-the cavalry&#xD;
echoed It back, and soon all that section of the&#xD;
mighty netropoliorresounded with: "long live&#xD;
Bonaparte"&#xD;
The gates swang wide upon their hinges, nd&#xD;

&#xD;
THE MAMELUKE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Bonaparte rode forth, mounted upon a noble&#xD;
gray charger. He wore the uniform of his grade,&#xD;
his long hair partially concealed his pale cheeks,&#xD;
and his eye flashed with daring. Behind him-&#xD;
were his generals, war-worn and bearing marks*&#xD;
of many a fiery baptism upon their bronzed&#xD;
countenances.. Before him, as he emerged into&#xD;
the streets, was the Paris populace-that terrible&#xD;
multitude, whose hands still reeked with the&#xD;
blood of their murdered sovereigns. Checking&#xD;
his horse, he,-raised his hat and cried, in a com-&#xD;
manding tone of voice:&#xD;
"Long live the Republic !"&#xD;
But the people and the military suite respond-&#xD;
ed with an enthusiastic shout:            ~&#xD;
" Long live Bonaparte I"&#xD;
The general's face flushed with pride, and he&#xD;
gave the order "Forward to the ,Tuileries."&#xD;
From that moment until his star paled before&#xD;
British gold, Napoleon Bonaparte ruled France.&#xD;
Let us now return to Osmapli, who marched&#xD;
away from prison with his deliverers. But ere&#xD;
the guard could reach the barracks, they metthe&#xD;
regiment, and were ordered to fall into the ranks.&#xD;
This was an awkward dilemma, especially as&#xD;
none of the soldiers knew where they were march.&#xD;
ing, but there was no alternative. Osmaiili fell&#xD;
in, with his friends, and they all: were relieved&#xD;
when they found that they were marching out of&#xD;
the city. On, on,- they followed the inspiring'&#xD;
martial music, nor was the word ."halt " given.,&#xD;
until the column had entered the 'shades of the&#xD;
park of St. Cloud. That,night, Osmanli biv-&#xD;
ouacked with the regiment, and such was the&#xD;
confusion that no officer remarked anew face in&#xD;
the ranks'.&#xD;
Early the next morning, the members of the&#xD;
legislative bodies began to arrive at St. Cloud,&#xD;
to where they had been adjourned. Guards were&#xD;
posted throughout the park and the-palace, and&#xD;
Osmanlifound himself stationed in the orangery,&#xD;
where the Council of Five Hundred soon began&#xD;
to assemble. The metabers were in a high state&#xD;
of excitement, as the Parisians had shown no&#xD;
discontent at Bonaparte's assumption of power,&#xD;
and the session commenced amid excitement of&#xD;
the wildest description. General - Bonaparte's&#xD;
brother Lucien was president, but he had few&#xD;
partisans, and there was soon a storm of abuse&#xD;
and vehement denunciation, mingled with cries&#xD;
of " Down with the dictatorI Death to the new&#xD;
CromwellI Let us die rather than submit 0'&#xD;
At this critical junctuie, Bonaparte entered&#xD;
the hall, and approached the president's chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
The tempest now became a hurricane, and just&#xD;
as he reached the centre of the hall, ahundre4&#xD;
voices shouted " Death to the tyrant." - Leaving&#xD;
their seats, they rushed towards him, and one, a&#xD;
Corsican, aimed a dagger At his throat. Luckily&#xD;
for Bonaparte,^the greniadierson duty no sooner&#xD;
saw how he was menaced, than they hastened to&#xD;
the room, and Thome, casting his arm before the&#xD;
assassin, received the glittering steel. Another&#xD;
deputy had drawn a weapon, but Osmanli seized&#xD;
him, and arrested his blow.&#xD;
For the first and only time, Bonaparte's iron&#xD;
nerves were shaken. He could brave the horrors&#xD;
of warfare, but not this civic ruffianism, and with&#xD;
a hurried word of thanks to his preservers, he&#xD;
staggered rather than walked into the open air,&#xD;
There, mounting his horse, he ordered the drums&#xD;
to beat "to the colors," and as the troops sur-&#xD;
rounded him, in a hollow square, their serried&#xD;
ranks restored his wonted vigor.&#xD;
"Comrades !" said he, and his voice rang&#xD;
like a clarion, "I was about to point onit to yon-_&#xD;
der mob the means of saving the republic, and&#xD;
of restoring our honor. They answered me with&#xD;
drawn daggers. What more could England&#xD;
have desired ' Comrades, I have led you to&#xD;
fame-to glory-to honor! Can I - now- rely&#xD;
upon you'?"  '&#xD;
"Yes ! yes !  We swear to uphold youI!"&#xD;
shouted every man, and putting their tall bear.&#xD;
skin caps on their bayonets, they waved them in&#xD;
manifestation-of their joyful allegiance. Soon,&#xD;
the beat of the drums restored order. Com-&#xD;
mands were issued. Companies marched n,&#xD;
different directions, and one took possession of&#xD;
the Council Hall, driving the refractory members&#xD;
out of the windows, which were near the ground.-&#xD;
The bristling line of bayonets was an unanswer-&#xD;
able argument, and the valiant orators retreated&#xD;
with such undignified precipitation that they left&#xD;
their hats and scarfs, as they crowded through&#xD;
the narrow outlet. Leaping to the earth, they-&#xD;
ran away like frightened sheep through the park,&#xD;
and the dynasty of the military ruler'was estab-&#xD;
lished.-&#xD;
Josephine, who had urged Bonaparte.to take&#xD;
this 'important step, awaited his return with&#xD;
heartfelt anxiety. Sometimes her fondest hopes"&#xD;
seemed about to be realized, and she -imagined&#xD;
that the prediction of the Creole fortune-teller&#xD;
Is about 'to 'befulfiled. Then, gloomy fear&#xD;
would fill her with apprehension, lest the bold&#xD;
game should be lost, in which case .a scaffold,&#xD;
would be her husband's portion--dishonor her&#xD;

&#xD;
lot. Atlast thersound of trumpets attracted her&#xD;
tohe'window, and lBonaparte,.rith a numerous&#xD;
suIte,.gallopedrinto the court-yard.. Dismount-&#xD;
ing, he saluted his escort, gnd was hailed with,&#xD;
loud shouts of " Long. live the consulI' Jose-&#xD;
phine knewithat he was successful, and she hast-&#xD;
ened to the door'to greet her warrior husband&#xD;
in a delirium of proud joy.&#xD;
That night, MXdame Wilmot called, and was&#xD;
permitted 'to see Josephine, who listened yith-&#xD;
sympathy to her sad recital. Judith had fol-&#xD;
lowed her father's remains to their final resting-&#xD;
place, and her first wretchedness had become&#xD;
chastened by that self-controlling philosophy&#xD;
which is one of thefblessings of grief.' But of Os-&#xD;
manli the poor woman could bring no tidings,&#xD;
though she confidently asserted his innocence.&#xD;
While they were conversing, Bonaparte entered&#xD;
the room. He at first pnanifested some displea-&#xD;
sure at finding a stranger with Josephine, but&#xD;
when he saw who it-was, his countenance bright-&#xD;
ened up.&#xD;
"I have it 1" he exclaimed. "I thought I&#xD;
knew him, although those rascally cut-throats&#xD;
rather disconcerted me."&#xD;
"iWho V" eagerly asked Madame Wilmot.&#xD;
"COsmanli ?"&#xD;
"The same, my good woman, if I am not&#xD;
much mistaken-"&#xD;
"And he was doing no harm ?" she inter-&#xD;
rupted.&#xD;
",Harm ! Why he was saving my life; a fa-&#xD;
vorite movement of his, with which I find no&#xD;
fault."&#xD;
Thank Gdd!- Thank God 1" ejaculated Ma-&#xD;
dame Wilmot., "But where can I find my son!"&#xD;
"You shall see him to-morrow morning, my&#xD;
friend, although I cannot imagine' how he be-&#xD;
came transferred from a bolted cell into the&#xD;
ranks of my grenadier regiment. But they are&#xD;
strange Afellows, those grenadiers, and seldom.&#xD;
wrong. Wait until to-morrow, and you will see&#xD;
them."&#xD;
And Madame Wilmot ~returned to Judith,&#xD;
who was equally delighted to hear the intelli-&#xD;
gence. Still, although she could not believe&#xD;
that Okmanli was her. father's murderer, she&#xD;
could but shudder at the thought that such a&#xD;
fearful aeensation hung over him. A heavy&#xD;
cloud eclipsed all the, pleasant emotions of her,&#xD;
heart; and she feared that the affection she enter-&#xD;
tained for Osmanli could never blossom again.&#xD;
Midight was marked by the cathedral bell,&#xD;
and as the other city clocks pealed forth an ir-&#xD;
&#xD;
I '&#xD;
&#xD;
regular response, a tall man, wrapped inacloak,&#xD;
rang at' the house where Judith reside.' 1e&#xD;
aske4 the half-awakened porter for Madame'&#xD;
Wilmot, but ere he could persuade the stupid'&#xD;
servant to ask that lady to. receive his visit) she-&#xD;
came down stairs. Sleep had. not visited her&#xD;
eyes, and as the knock reverberated through-the&#xD;
house, she fancied that it- might be Osmanli.'&#xD;
Again she was doomed to disappointment, for&#xD;
she knew not the-stranger.&#xD;
1"Madame," said he,."I am a gentleman, and&#xD;
a friend to the young man who is said to be your&#xD;
son. If you will Accompany me, I can convince&#xD;
you of his innocence of the murder of Mordecai&#xD;
Fezenzac."&#xD;
"I know you not," she replied, "but your&#xD;
manner is that of an honorable man, who will&#xD;
not add to the misfortunes of a lacerated heart.&#xD;
Permit me to attire myself, and I will cheerfully&#xD;
accompany you."&#xD;
Hastening up stairs, she soon descended, and&#xD;
the stranger handed her into a coach. A rapid&#xD;
half-hour's drive, in perfect silence, and they&#xD;
stopped' near the cathedral of Notre Dame.&#xD;
Alighting, Madame Wilmot was escorted, with&#xD;
the precautioniswe have already described, down&#xD;
into the catacombs. And there, stretchedupon&#xD;
a bed of agony, lay the once brilliant Colonel&#xD;
Margry. He had endeavored, the previous morn-&#xD;
ing, to. corrupt some of the soldiers formerly-un-&#xD;
der his command. But they refused to listen to&#xD;
his seductive promises, and when he unluckily&#xD;
denounced General Bonaparte, they nearly beat&#xD;
him to death. Nothing but the exertions of an&#xD;
officer saved his life, and as it was, his proud'&#xD;
heart was broken by the indignity. Managing&#xD;
with difficulty to reach the catacombs, he threw&#xD;
himself at the feet of the Count de Vergennes,&#xD;
praying a shelter while life lasted. Although&#xD;
detesting him,. the count's noble nature could&#xD;
not refuse this request, and he sent for a physi-&#xD;
cian. But it was too late, and the doctor, with&#xD;
an ominous shake of the head, said that a con-&#xD;
fessor would be more serviceable.&#xD;
So numerous were those connected with the&#xD;
royalist plot, that it was an easy matter for the&#xD;
count to summons a reverend brother-and the&#xD;
priest who came, curiously enough, was a mem-&#xD;
ber, of the lodge where Osmanli and Fezenzac&#xD;
had met, on the night when the last mentioned&#xD;
was slain. What then was his delight, when;&#xD;
after confessing a black catalogue of crimes, the&#xD;
dying man exculpated Osmanli by avowing him-&#xD;
self the murderer of Judith's father. He had&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;

"    AiOON- BowAPART     rules France i"&#xD;
Such was the cry of the delighted Parisians''and&#xD;
it wanre-echoed by lie hunters on the Pyrenees,&#xD;
the fishermen on. the Norman coasts, and the'&#xD;
vine-dressers in the interior provinces'  Fast&#xD;
sped the ,news, over Wnountain and vale, plain&#xD;
and forest, with the rapid flight of Clan Alpines&#xD;
fiery'ebss, awakening high hopes inthe breasts&#xD;
of all who wished well for the nation. True, the&#xD;
uid&amp;amp;enturous soldier shared the power with two&#xD;
f0llow-consuls, but every one knew that he could&#xD;
make them subservient to his willand carry out&#xD;
his-own plans. What those: plans wereno one&#xD;
knew, but every one appeared confident that they&#xD;
would regenerate public affairs, and restore&#xD;
'As Osmanli approached the residence of .the&#xD;
commander-in-chief, he saw 'many :evidences of&#xD;
the change in the social rank of its owner A&#xD;

No sooner did his quick eye discern the grena-&#xD;

Osmanli and Thome- into the midst of the as-&#xD;

door, and enter, you will there find friends.';&#xD;
Bewilderedrand astonished, Osmanli mean.&#xD;
ically turnedithe handle of th6 ddeorpointed ont&#xD;
and, entered a small' room. There stood;his'&#xD;
mother, who-had been anxiotsly'awaitinhisA&#xD;
arrival-and:who-nOw, with a cery of joy fdld~d&#xD;
him to herheart; ' Whn ihe: frAt transports of&#xD;
&#xD;
delight had been indulged in, she gladdened his&#xD;
heart by informing him how the dying Margry&#xD;
had disclosed the truth, and established his inno-&#xD;
cence. What joyous news I The dark clouds&#xD;
which had lowered over the horizon of his hopes&#xD;
disappeared before the glad tidings-the world&#xD;
seemed brighter than- it' ever had before-nor&#xD;
could he look upon the past except as a fearful&#xD;
dream.&#xD;
There was, a knock at the door, and Josephine&#xD;
entered, leading Judith Fezenzac by the hand.&#xD;
"Do not blush," said Madame Bonaparte,&#xD;
"for we know all your temptations and afflic-&#xD;
tions-your sufferings of body and of mind.&#xD;
You have erred-who has not? But all that I&#xD;
can remember of the 'past is, that you have twice&#xD;
saved the life of -my 'noble .husb d-besides&#xD;
having preserved my nightingale ere from a&#xD;
fate far worse than death. Besides, your mother&#xD;
is an old friend; so do not look so penitent.",&#xD;
Osmanli could not speak, but bowed his grati-&#xD;
tude. Never had Judith appeared so lovely to'&#xD;
him before, for sorrow had but passed over her&#xD;
featutes like a dove, the surface looking softer&#xD;
from the touch of its wing. Forgiveness beamed&#xD;
from her sparkling eyes, a kind smile kindled&#xD;
around the corners of her expressive mouth, and&#xD;
as she sat down beside his mother, the young&#xD;
man knew not which to admire nost-or which&#xD;
he loved the best.&#xD;
Josephine was in high spirits, but the others,&#xD;
although perhaps happier, did not say mpch-&#xD;
their hearts were too full.&#xD;
gy the way, major," said Josephine, " your&#xD;
post in the consular guard will make you a fre-&#xD;
quent inmate of the palace when we are once in-&#xD;
staged there, and I warn you in advance that&#xD;
you are not to make love to my maids of honor !"&#xD;
"Ah, Madame Bonaparte," replied Osmanli,&#xD;
"you need not fear me. Experience has taught&#xD;
me how dangerous it in to be tob susceptible."&#xD;
" Very well!I Especially the side-glance at&#xD;
Mademoiselle Judith. Well, as she is already&#xD;
named as one of my attendants, she should take&#xD;
such a rejection of her charms as an insult."&#xD;
"Madame, I-I-"&#xD;
"Don't stammer, major. Br t you must all&#xD;
know that I have to make preparations for our&#xD;
removal.to the'palace, so I shall avail myself of&#xD;
my'official privilege, aqd send you away. Don't&#xD;
forget, my dear Madame Wilmot, to come- And&#xD;
see me when I am installed in my new quarters."&#xD;
"Yes, your majesty" replied Madame Wil.&#xD;
mot, with a low courtesy. "You remember-"&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
" The fortune-teller!" exclaimed Josephine.&#xD;
'That I db, and I feel assured that the predic-&#xD;
tion will be fulfilled. Besides, Napoleon told&#xD;
me last night of a wonderful prediction made&#xD;
about him when he was in Egypt, by an Oriental&#xD;
Magician. Adieu.. Let me s&amp;amp; you often."&#xD;
Osmanli sighed, but the kind, earnest tone in&#xD;
which Judith said farewell, convinced his throb.&#xD;
bing heart that they would soon meet again, and&#xD;
that he had not forfeited her esteem.&#xD;
They. were soon at Madare Wilmot's house,&#xD;
and the fond mother took her son to gaze upon&#xD;
the portrait of his father. To her it was a joyous&#xD;
though melancholy moment, and early love, re-&#xD;
lieved from the trouble of years, was as bright&#xD;
and as fresh as a house atPompeii, just disen-&#xD;
tombed from the ashes in which it had been&#xD;
buried for years.&#xD;
Happy were they in each ptier's society, that&#xD;
long separated mother and son. But Osmanli's&#xD;
thoughts would occasionally wander to General&#xD;
Bonaparte's, and he would wonderif there would&#xD;
ever be a time when he could woo and win Ju-&#xD;
dith's gentle heart. The duties of his new office,&#xD;
however, soon engrossed his entire, time, and&#xD;
most of his thoughts. The consular guard, in&#xD;
which he held a majority,. was culled from the&#xD;
best troops of the army, and every man selected&#xD;
was a veteran, who had served in those cam-&#xD;
paigns which elevated their leder to renown.&#xD;
Bonaparte was much interested in the new corps,&#xD;
and not a day passed that be did not visit the&#xD;
barracks, to chat with -the war-bronzed soldiers&#xD;
who filled its ranks. One had been with him at&#xD;
Toulon, an6ther at Arcola-some' had fought&#xD;
under his orders in Egypt, and many bore hon-&#xD;
orable scars of his Italian campaign. Need it be&#xD;
said that he was welcomed with shouts of glad-&#xD;
ness, nor was any one more delighted to see him&#xD;
than Osmanli, for he always spoke of Judith,&#xD;
and often, by a delicate jest, brought the warm&#xD;
blopd to the major's cheek.&#xD;
Soon.there was a grand military parade-a&#xD;
double ceremonial of rejoicing enlr seventy-two&#xD;
Turkish standards captured at A ionkir; and of&#xD;
honor to the memory of George Washington.&#xD;
The order, signed by Bonaparte, and dated on&#xD;
the ninth of February, 1800, closed in these&#xD;
words: "Washington is dead-thatgreat man,&#xD;
who fought against tyranny, and consolidated the&#xD;
liberty of his country. His memory ivill ever be&#xD;
dear to the French people, and to all freemen in&#xD;
both worlds: but more especially to the soldiers&#xD;
of France, who, like him and his American&#xD;

&#xD;
troops, fight in defence of liberty and equality."&#xD;
This ceremony was the first appearance ofI&#xD;
Bonaparte in public since he had assumed the4&#xD;
consular power, and at an early hour every place&#xD;
that command d a view of the expectedProces-&#xD;
sion was occupied. Every window an balcony&#xD;
of every house teemed With the fairer sex, thel&#xD;
very housetops were instinct yvith- life, and the&#xD;
steets on either side presented a dense mass of&#xD;
human beings, with difficulty kept back within&#xD;
the bounds of'their confined space by grumbling&#xD;
dragoons. Soon came the procession, banners&#xD;
waving, plumes dancing, bayonets glistening in&#xD;
the sun, and martial music pealing forth inspir-&#xD;
uing strains. The captured standards, each borne&#xD;
bya veteran, formed an attractive feature of the&#xD;
procession, but they were eclipsed by what, fol-&#xD;
lowed them. In the midst of a splendidly uni-&#xD;
'formed suite, but himself dressed with republican&#xD;
simplicity, rode the First Consul, the cynosure&#xD;
upon which all eyes rested. Loud were the&#xD;
shouts which greeted him, but he simply ac-&#xD;
ktiowledged the loyal demonstratibns by an oc-&#xD;
dasional dignified nod. The Parisians, at last,&#xD;
had found a master.&#xD;
Behind General Bonaparte, in a carriage&#xD;
drawn by four horses, rode Josephine, whose&#xD;
joyous countenance expressed'the pleasure she&#xD;
experienced at seeing the idol of her heart thus&#xD;
devotedly cheered., She was accompanied by&#xD;
Judith, who could but gaze at a dashing young&#xD;
officer, who commanded the consular escort, and&#xD;
rode by their carriage window. Once, too, when&#xD;
his high-mettled charger reared and plunged&#xD;
furiously, taking fright at a band of music, her&#xD;
cheek blanched, and tears dropped from her&#xD;
lone eyelids. It was Osmanli, and then, for the&#xD;
first time, Judith felt that she really'loved him.&#xD;
Ia the "Temple of Mars"'the scene was in-&#xD;
teresting and impressive. The captured stan-&#xD;
dards were arranged arotind a fine best of the&#xD;
American -iberator, while on either side stood&#xD;
two veterans, each in his hundredth'year. An&#xD;
ortioin was pronounced by  . de-l!ontanes, a&#xD;
funeial ode ivas chanted by a large choir, and,&#xD;
throughout the ceremony, lBinapate received&#xD;
regal honors,.&#xD;
Returning in command of the escort, Osmanli&#xD;

progress barred by a large assemblage,'appar-&#xD;
ently intoxicated with rage, shouting:&#xD;
"Hang him! String hirh up to a lamp-post !"&#xD;
"What is the disturbance ?" inquired Osmanli&#xD;
of a burly lookingman, who, with a coil of rope,.&#xD;
was hastening to the scene of tumult.&#xD;
" Matter, monsieur officer! Matter. enough.&#xD;
We have found a royalist, a rich one, too, dis-&#xD;
tributing proclamations against Bonapaite. Ah!&#xD;
the rascal. We have him, though, and if his&#xD;
name is De Vergennes, we will soon string him&#xD;
up-"&#xD;
"De Vergennes !" exclaimed Osmanli, with&#xD;
astonishment. Then, recollecting himself, he&#xD;
added: " The very man I am commissioned to&#xD;
arrest. Where is he ?"&#xD;
I" Safe enough, monsieur officer. But he will.&#xD;
soon have little breath to answer your inquiries.&#xD;
We have found him corrupting the people, and.&#xD;
we must hang him, After that, pest-you can&#xD;
have him."&#xD;
"But General Bonaparte! His orders !"&#xD;
"Bother me if I know I" And the zealous&#xD;
amateur hangman evidently felt perplexed.&#xD;
"Look here, citizen," said Osraanli, with as&#xD;
much coolness as he could assume. "liere I&#xD;
ain, in command of a squadron of General Bona-&#xD;
parte's new guard-I must have that de Ver-&#xD;
gennes, or I can never return to my superior&#xD;
officer. And I know, that you and those other&#xD;
citizens will feel sure of justice froin the con-&#xD;
queror at Montenotte and the Pyrainids !"&#xD;
" All correct-Wait here a moment, And you&#xD;
will have your man." And he rshed into the&#xD;
mob, where his voice was soon heard, demand-&#xD;
ing silence. Then there was an outcry. Silence&#xD;
again. ' And then, amid shouts of "Long live&#xD;
Bonaparte," the mass heaved open, and the un-&#xD;
fortunate de Vergennes appeared, his eldthing.&#xD;
rent in tatters, his face covered with blood, -and&#xD;
his hands pinioned behind him.&#xD;
Making him a hurried sign to be quiet, Os-&#xD;
manli said, "Aha, count I I was just looking&#xD;
for you, but these good citizens have hunted you&#xD;
out." Then ordering a trooper to dimotunt, he&#xD;
bad the prisoner placed on his horse, with strict&#xD;
irAtructions to'kill him if he attetnpted to escape.&#xD;
'this pleased the crowd much, and'as the troop-&#xD;
*6rs trotted off to their barracks, they were 5alut&#xD;
Aed with loud cries of- "Long live B6nayane!'&#xD;
"Long live the consul's guard !"&#xD;
The tstaat the squadron was within the bar-&#xD;
rckeiaIs, Ystnanli ordered the rekher'to' be&#xD;
&#xD;
70&#xD;
&#xD;
conducted to his own room, where he soon joined&#xD;
him.&#xD;
" Pardon me, count," he said,.as he entered,&#xD;
"for the unceremonious manner in which I have&#xD;
treated you. But-"&#xD;
1      GBt you have saved my life, my generous&#xD;
friend. God reward you.. I can even now feel&#xD;
their ferocious blows, and iiagine myself upon&#xD;
the verge of the grave. Let me but once get out&#xD;
of France, and her people may elect their own&#xD;
politics. 1 shall not attempt to play the con-&#xD;
spirator again.' But will I not involve you, my&#xD;
generous friend ?"&#xD;
"Nay, nay ' replied Osmanli. "And if you&#xD;
did, I sm repaying a'debt. I shall see the first&#xD;
consul this very evening, and think I can obtain,&#xD;
your pardon. Meanwhile my servant will aid&#xD;
you in changing your apparel. Adieu."&#xD;
'Late that night a post-carriage started from&#xD;
the barracks of the guard, carrying the Count de&#xD;
Vergennes, with a passport as beaner of de-&#xD;
&#xD;
spatches to the Prussian government. Osmanli,&#xD;
finding General Bonaparte in excellent spirits at&#xD;
the dinner-table, and above all delighted with his&#xD;
new regiment of guards, narrated their first ex-&#xD;
ploit. Bonaparte was delighted. "Let me but&#xD;
rule France a few years, though," said he, "and&#xD;
this mob will behave differently. But your friend&#xD;
is free, and I will send him across the frontiers.&#xD;
Tell him that I respect men, although I oppose&#xD;
some principles."&#xD;
Osmanli left soon after dinner, to prepare for&#xD;
his friend's departure; but Judith expressed so&#xD;
much interest in the matter, that he did not re-&#xD;
gret having relinquished a cherished project. In&#xD;
his dreams, however, he knelt at her feet, and&#xD;
told his love. Nor, when the reveille awoke&#xD;
him, was he certain for a few moments whether&#xD;
he was an accepted suitor or not.&#xD;
"CWell," he muttered to himself, as he de-&#xD;
scended the barr;uck staircase, "a few days move&#xD;
will1 decide my fae."&#xD;

image has been my idol, and every pure thought&#xD;

that I may, when I have proven my worthiness,&#xD;
call you mine own. Let our lives mingle their&#xD;
currents, and let me, as your protector, replace&#xD;
your father's loss."&#xD;
There was no reply, for the agitated girl could&#xD;
not speak. But Osmanli took courage from the&#xD;
eloquent encouragement of her eyes, those tele-&#xD;
graphs of love, whose bright glances convey&#xD;
hope quicker than speech, even as the-lightning&#xD;
far outstrips the thunder's voice. At last she&#xD;
smiled through her tears, and whispered:&#xD;
"Let what has .past be forgotten. And if I&#xD;
am worthy of your devotion, such love must&#xD;
make me happy."&#xD;
They loved. But word&amp;amp;cannot describe their&#xD;
interchange of sentiment, as for hours they paced&#xD;
up and down tlatold terrace.. The moon shone&#xD;
brightly, and the stars beamed like diamonds&#xD;
from heaven, to hallow every thought. Within&#xD;
was dancing and gaiety-while the city before&#xD;
them was busy, and noisy, and bustling-but&#xD;
neither were thought of by the now happy cou-&#xD;
ple. Often, since that time, has the same terrace&#xD;
witnessed the interchange of vows, but among&#xD;
the many who have poured. forth the boarded&#xD;
treasures of their hearts, none have loved more&#xD;
devotedly than the Mameluke. Nor cold he&#xD;
hear Judith own her preference for him, without&#xD;
feeling his heart's chords vibrate before her voice&#xD;
like those of an Eolian harp touched by the south&#xD;
wind.&#xD;
They were happy. Heart responded to heart,&#xD;
and their every thought, acquiring ethereal in-&#xD;
spiration, mingled. And what can be holier, on&#xD;
earth, than the first interchange of vows, in soli-&#xD;
tude, and by the gentle lights of night. If ever&#xD;
a ray from  the better world gilds the gloom&#xD;
which surrounds earth's fairest creations-if ever&#xD;
the light of hope mantles the check of despond-&#xD;
ency-if ever an angel folds his nestling pinions&#xD;
to contemplate a scene of earthly happiness, it is&#xD;
when the solemn hour of night is awakened by&#xD;
the pire and ardent vows of two loving spirits.&#xD;
Past existence seems worthless, but the new lpve&#xD;
blooms as a heaven-budded plant,, planted deep&#xD;
in the existence of each, and moistened by the&#xD;
fountains of life-&#xD;
"My children 1" .&#xD;

MELUKE.                                  78&#xD;
The'promenaders stopped, for they recognized&#xD;
the voice of Madame Wilmot. "My children,"&#xD;
she said, "for so I now feel that I may call you,&#xD;
inclination would have led me here an hour since,&#xD;
to assure you how I rejoice in the betrothal o'&#xD;
two so well qualified to make each othcr happy.&#xD;
But I could not bear to interrupt you. Now,&#xD;
Madame Bonaparte is inquiring for you, Judith,&#xD;
and I can only say that I shall ever ask Heaven's&#xD;
blessing upon your union."&#xD;
As they entered the saloon, they met General&#xD;
Bonaparte, with Josephine hanging on his arm.&#xD;
" Well, well I" he jocosely remarked, "while&#xD;
we have been receiving our guests, the major of&#xD;
my guards has been captivating my nightingale.&#xD;
So goes the world. But mind, major, you must&#xD;
not 6e tempted from the service again. France&#xD;
has need of such as you just now, and those who&#xD;
serve her will not be forgotten."&#xD;
"Nay, general," replied Osmanli, "my heart&#xD;
is pledged to Judith, but my sword is at your&#xD;
disposal."&#xD;
"Well spoken. What say, Josephine, shall&#xD;
we notwitness the marriage ceremony before the&#xD;
major is ordered on his first campaign !"&#xD;
'That," said Josephine, "will be as Judith&#xD;
says."&#xD;
Judith hung her head and blushed.&#xD;
"I. will set the day a fortnight hence, then,&#xD;
and we will have the marriage ceremony per-&#xD;
formed by the archbishop. Now, major, it is&#xD;
time for you to be in barracks, and Judith shall&#xD;
go with me to my.study and sing me one of the&#xD;
airs with which she used to cheer my Egyptian&#xD;
campaign."&#xD;
" I obey, general, and wish all good evening."&#xD;
"Bravo; bravo I You are a model soldier,&#xD;
and will make a model husband, I doubt not.&#xD;
Meanwhile, you can pass all your evenings here&#xD;
at the palace, if you will but return at a season-&#xD;
able hour, in order to be up at reveille."&#xD;
When Osmanli awoke the next morning, it&#xD;
was with difficulty that he could persuade him-&#xD;
self that the events of the past evening were not&#xD;
a dream. But when, after morning parade, hi&#xD;
called at the palace, he found that he was indeed&#xD;
a happy man.&#xD;
To add to his pleasure, he received a long&#xD;
letter that day from the Count de Vergennes,&#xD;
informing him that he had safely arrived in&#xD;
Prussia, and sh uld, for the present, remain a&#xD;
quiet spectator f political events. His gratitude&#xD;
for the service Osmanli had rendered him, was&#xD;
wnbonnded, and he expressed strong hopes that&#xD;

atome time he would repay the debt. Accom-&#xD;
panging the letter was a, small parcel, contain-&#xD;
ing a valuable diamond..&#xD;
. To display the many other gifts which Osmanli&#xD;
and Judith received, would require more room&#xD;
tha these pages can afford. Never did a young&#xD;
0ople enter upon life with fairer auspices, and&#xD;
yet, at times, Judith's fair brow was overcast&#xD;
w"di sadness. '&#xD;
One morning Osmanli called, in'full uniform,&#xD;
for lie had been with his squadron to escort Gen-&#xD;
eral Bonaparte on an excursion to a new bar-&#xD;
rack. Judith sprang to greet him, but her eyes&#xD;
filed with tears, and her fine lip quivered. She&#xD;
did not speak, but held out her hand, and grasped&#xD;
hil warmly.'&#xD;
"'Whysis this ?" asked Osmanli. "In tears!&#xD;
Surely, dearest, nothing can have-gone wrong ?"&#xD;
"iNo, no !" replied Judith, mastering her&#xD;
emotion. "Listen!I I was' just regretting, be-&#xD;
fote you entered, that you had embraced the&#xD;
profession of arms-a profession that is glorious&#xD;
and renowned, but alas, full of peril. You are&#xD;
today in the full enjoyment of life and health,&#xD;
bust let'duty summon you to the tented field, and&#xD;
to-morrow you may be a corpse. Oppressed by&#xD;
these thoughts,'I felt sad, And your unexpected&#xD;
entry, in the trappings of war, caused an over.&#xD;
fidw of my laden heart."&#xD;
"Dearest Judith, it was but last evening that&#xD;
SI ld a long conversation with my dear mother&#xD;
Ott this very subject. Honor keeps me for the&#xD;
present in the service, but perhaps,ere very long,&#xD;
I shall cross the ocean with my mother, to see&#xD;
my father's home. Will it please my nightin-&#xD;
gale to abide there, in the deep forests, where&#xD;
nmt'erreigns ".       .&#xD;
"Anywhere, Osmanli) if you are there. But,&#xD;
it you love me, do not make my future existence&#xD;
unhappy by remaining in the army."&#xD;
""Treason-rank treason 1" exclaimed a well-&#xD;
kAo*zn voice. Both started, and each looked&#xD;
eoiffised, for it was General Bonaparte who had&#xD;
spoken. He had entered just after. Osmanli,&#xD;
but so absorbed were the young couple in each&#xD;
other, that they had not noticed hin.&#xD;
Yes," he continued, "here I find a lady en.&#xD;
deavoring to persuade the major of my guards&#xD;
to desert, and that just as his command is&#xD;
oganized."&#xD;
"No, general I" said Osmanli, in a respectful&#xD;
toee, "Not to desert. Iudith knows too well-&#xD;
helw deeply I am indebted to you, and how de-&#xD;
tetmined I am to show my gratitude. When&#xD;
&#xD;
1-1&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
the enemies of France are conquered, and you&#xD;
are king-"I&#xD;
"Say emperor," interrupted Bonaparte, with&#xD;
a smile.&#xD;
"Well, emperor. Tlen, and not until then,&#xD;
will I resign my swordd"&#xD;
"Then, and not until then, my gallant yet&#xD;
love-lorn youth, will I accept your resignation.&#xD;
When is the wedding to take place ?"&#xD;
"Next week, general."&#xD;
"Well, well. We must see that the ceremony,&#xD;
is worthy of the occasion; nor will I longer in-&#xD;
terrupt the billing and cooing. But," and he&#xD;
raised his finger menacingly, "no more talk&#xD;
about leaving the-service."&#xD;
Why linger upon the description of these pre-&#xD;
cious interview, when we can at once portray&#xD;
the accomplishment 6f each fond hope. The&#xD;
marriage ceremony was celebrated in the mag-&#xD;
nificent gothic pile of Notre Dame, a chapel of&#xD;
which*was expressly decorated for the occasion.&#xD;
General Bonaparte's uncle Lucien, who was a&#xD;
dignitary in the Roman church, performed the&#xD;
ceremony, and numerous was the attendance of&#xD;
fair women and brave men. Each of the happy&#xD;
couple was first baptized, and then joined by&#xD;
those sacred ties which death alone can sever.&#xD;
The bridegroom, ih the prime of life, seemed the&#xD;
.personification of happiness, and the bride could'&#xD;
but realize the most refined conception of female&#xD;
oveliness that ever flashed through a sculptor's&#xD;
dreams.&#xD;
" Amen and amen! Peace on earth and good&#xD;
will to man," rang through the vaulted aisles of&#xD;
the gothic fane. Osmanli Wilmot and Judith&#xD;
Fezenzac were thenceforth one, and as the happy&#xD;
bridegroom gazed at his bride, he saw her star-&#xD;
light eyes flooded with the sa e sweet tears of&#xD;
joy that coursed down his own manly cheek.&#xD;
The wilderness of doubts, and fears, and trials,&#xD;
was traversed, while happy thoughts, and joyous&#xD;
raptures, scattered rose-leaved upon the pleasant&#xD;
pathway, on which they now walked hand-in-&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
After the ceremony at the church, there was a&#xD;
brilliant entertainment at the palace; in honor of&#xD;
the event. For the first time since\ the unfortu-&#xD;
nate Queen Marie Antoinette had left them, to&#xD;
ascend the fatal scaffold, the salons of the Tuil-&#xD;
eries, refulgent with the light of myriads of wax&#xD;
candles, were filledwith a gay throng. But the&#xD;
glare of illumination, nor the splendor of dresses,&#xD;
nor the scintillations of jewelry, nor the romafitie&#xD;
beauty of the young, nor the mature animation&#xD;
&#xD;
of the matrons,,was not equal to the serene de-&#xD;
light which beamed from the happy couple's eyes.&#xD;
Refreshments were most profusely circulated&#xD;
throughout the evening, and at midnight Gen-&#xD;
eral Bonaparte and Josephine, followed by the&#xD;
bride and bridegroom, led the way to a magnifi-&#xD;
cent supper-table, covered with game, fruit and&#xD;
choice wines. A band of musie poured forth&#xD;
lively strains, and joy reigned on every hand.&#xD;
Soon 'the music ceased, and the host gave a&#xD;
toast. It was:&#xD;
"The health of Colonel Wilmot, of the con-&#xD;
sular guard-of his bride, a lady of honor in this&#xD;
palace, and of his-excellent mother, superintend-&#xD;
ent of the consular domestic expenditures."&#xD;
And turning towards Osmanli, he handed him&#xD;
the three parchments, commissions which half of&#xD;
those present would have sacrificed their all to&#xD;
have obtained.&#xD;
There was a&amp;amp;i instant of silence. Osmanli es-&#xD;
sayed to- reply, but-could not express his grati-&#xD;
tude. Springing forward, he sank upon one&#xD;
knee, and grasping Bonaparte's hand with reve-&#xD;
rential deference, he pressed it to his lips. Tho&#xD;
effect was electrical, for it was the homage only'&#xD;
paid to sovereigns, and amid loud shQuts of&#xD;
"Long live Bonaparte I" Osmanli rose, saluted&#xD;
the company, and left the festive scene.&#xD;
&#xD;
A few fleeting days'of happiness, and Osmanli.&#xD;
was ordered to march, at the head of his regi-&#xD;
ment, towards Italy. It was hard to part with&#xD;
Judith, but in relinquishing the pleasures of con-&#xD;
nubial love, he entered the field of glory, where&#xD;
he could serve his idolized benefactor. Besides,&#xD;
his mother watched over his bride, and they both&#xD;
enjoyed the protection of Madame Bonaparte.&#xD;
Crossing France, the army marched directly&#xD;
.toyards the towering Alps, whose summits,&#xD;
crowned with snow, are enthroned in clouds.&#xD;
There was no road, and -the narrow path was&#xD;
one along which the chamois-hunter picked his&#xD;
way with caution. On the one side,.death await-&#xD;
ed a single false step, on the other, towered&#xD;
overhanging avalanches; but, animated by the&#xD;
presence of Bonaparte, the columns passed over&#xD;
without accident. And as the army descended&#xD;
on the other side of the mountains, entering a&#xD;
beautiful valley, full of verdure and luxuriant&#xD;
vines, all admitted that the honor of the passage,&#xD;
next to Bonaparte, belonged to the colonel of&#xD;
his guard, who had led the way.&#xD;
Such was the honorable mention of Osmanli,&#xD;
in the bulletin sent by the general to Paris. It&#xD;
gladdened the hearts of his mother and his bride,&#xD;
yet they wept when they thought of the dangers&#xD;
which he had undergone.&#xD;

MONTEBELo and Marengo I They were hard&#xD;
fought fields, on each of which "bones crashed'&#xD;
like hailstones against windows," as the French,&#xD;
charging with vigor into the Austrian columns,&#xD;
won brilliant and decisive victories. Foremost&#xD;
in each fight, at the head of his serried ranks,&#xD;
was Osmanli, who had that quickness of percep-&#xD;
tion so necessary to an officer, yet never suffered&#xD;
his intrepidity to lead him beyond his duty. At&#xD;
Marengo he won high honor, for when sent un-&#xD;
der General Desaix to turn the tide of the fight,&#xD;
before which some French regiments had faltered,&#xD;
the brave general received a musket-ball in his&#xD;
forehead, and fell dead. For a moment,' the&#xD;
cavalry tightened their reins, but just then, in a&#xD;
tone which rang far above the -din of battle, Os-&#xD;
manli shouted:&#xD;
ForwardI Charge for Bonaparte and ven-&#xD;
geance I"&#xD;
"Bonaparte and vengeance !" echoed the&#xD;
guards, the cry stimulating them with fresh&#xD;
courage.  On- they dashed, their long sabres&#xD;
gleahiing above the sulphurous clouds which&#xD;
rolled ovei the plain, and soon'they rode through&#xD;
the opposing forces, cutting and trampling down&#xD;
the Austrians as'if they were destroying a field&#xD;
of wheat. That charge gained the day, but the&#xD;
loss of Desaix clouded Bonaparte's enjoyment,&#xD;
and that night, when Osmanli came to make his&#xD;
report, the general said&#xD;
&#xD;
"Your bravery, Colonel Wilmot, won the&#xD;
victory, and your young wife's heart will leap&#xD;
for joy when she hears your praises on every&#xD;
tongue. Yet how different would she have felt&#xD;
had your fate been that of poor Desaix. Per-&#xD;
haps she would have reproached me, too. No-&#xD;
this must not be. Listen, colonel, I once told&#xD;
yot that you owed me-owed France, a debt.&#xD;
You have pa-id it. This campaign is -over, and&#xD;
now, honorably discharged, you can live in com-&#xD;
fortable retirement." '&#xD;
" General," replied Osmanli, "I have but per-&#xD;
formed my duty, and never will I forsake you,&#xD;
whilst you need a sword or a horseman. Yet-"&#xD;
"Yet," interrupted Bonaparte, "you love&#xD;
your wife, and she is opposed to warfare. Would&#xD;
that all mankind'were. For-my own part, I am&#xD;
but as the mouth-piece, through -hich, as&#xD;
through a trumpet, speaks the warlike genius of&#xD;
the French people. - I find the nation turbulent&#xD;
and dissatisfied, and I unite them to combat -&#xD;
others. Warfare is one of the passions of man-&#xD;
kind, 'and I must adopt it as the foundation of,&#xD;
my power. But never can I bring sorrow into&#xD;
so gentle a heart as that of your bridQ. No, no!&#xD;
They may call mie a military 'tyrant, but my&#xD;
behrt is not callous to'the finer feelings of hu-&#xD;
manity."                   ,1     '%&#xD;

"But I cannot desert you now. When you as-'&#xD;
cend the imperial throne, I can perhaps retire,&#xD;
to contemplate your glories from another hemi-&#xD;
sphere."&#xD;
."&amp;amp;Well, well. We shall see. Now for the&#xD;
reports."&#xD;
A narrative of this conversation, which Os-&#xD;
manli sent to Paris by the same courier who&#xD;
conveyed intelligence of the victory, gladdened-&#xD;
the hearts of his wife and mother. All the proud&#xD;
mentions of the young hero's na ne did not, in&#xD;
their eyes, compensate for the anguish they ex-&#xD;
perienced when they first received the false in-&#xD;
telligence that he had fallen.I&#xD;
Soon the army returned to Paris, and was re-&#xD;
ceived with turaultuous applause. Thanksgiv-&#xD;
ings were offered up in the churches, shouts of&#xD;
welcome and congratulation resopunded on every&#xD;
side, and the streets were strewn with flowers as&#xD;
the conquerors passed. The valor of the-con-I&#xD;
sular guards had preceded theip, and Osmanli,&#xD;
distinguished by his uniform, received cheer&#xD;
,after cheer. Bue the triumphal ovation was, to&#xD;
him, long and tedious. At length his regiment&#xD;
reached -its barracks, and he hastened to the pal.-&#xD;
ace. There, folded to the heart of his own Ju-&#xD;
dith, he felt happier than had he been in Bona-&#xD;
parte's position, or worn a crown.I&#xD;
"And you will not leave me again ?"'she&#xD;
asked, with an irresistible smile.&#xD;
"Henceforth, dearest," was his reply, "I am&#xD;
yours 'alone. The general has promised to give&#xD;
me a diplomatic mission, and having then hon-&#xD;
orably resigned my commission, I can be ever&#xD;
with those I love."&#xD;
" But, Osmanli. will you not cross the ocean ?&#xD;
Your mother has quite prepossessed me iti favor&#xD;
of America, where your father's estate now&#xD;
awaits your coniing."&#xD;
" But can you forego the luxuries of city life ?"&#xD;
" Yes, yes ! With you, dearest, I can be happy&#xD;
anywhere. And' there you will be away from&#xD;
the enticements of military glory. But here&#xD;
comes our mother."&#xD;
The meeting between Osmanli and Madame&#xD;
Wilmot was affectionate and cordial, and she&#xD;
soon united her prayers to the wish of Judith,&#xD;
that they could cross the ocean.&#xD;
"Wait until -after the imperial coronation,"&#xD;
said Osmanli, with a smile, as they descended to&#xD;
the drawing-room.   -&#xD;
A few days passed, and Osmanli was sent'&#xD;
on a mission to Madrid, and when he returned,&#xD;
he found that during his absence he had been&#xD;

CHAPTER XXL&#xD;
FAREWELL TO FRANCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
MELUKE.                                 77&#xD;
honorably discharged from the service, and' ap-&#xD;
pointed treasurer of the consular household. To&#xD;
Madame Wilmot and Judith, this was a happy&#xD;
change, for they could now live united, and en-&#xD;
joy the social pleasures of domestic life. Os-&#xD;
manli was also rejoiced at being able to enjoy&#xD;
the society of his wife and mother, although oc-&#xD;
casionally, when his old regiment passed hia in&#xD;
the street, his heart would thr9b with martial&#xD;
pride, and a sigh would escape his lips. Curi-&#xD;
ously enough, General Bonaparte now seldom&#xD;
noticed hin, but that was not perhaps to be&#xD;
wondered at, so arduously did the first consul&#xD;
labor to consolidate the government. Republi-&#xD;
cattforms and usages vanished like an autumnal&#xD;
frost before the morning's sun. The etiquette&#xD;
of a court was revived. Chatnberlains, equerries,&#xD;
and other costly attendants on royalty were in-&#xD;
stalled at the palace, nor was there any' limit&#xD;
there to ostentatious display or lavish extrava-&#xD;
gance. All- the shattered fragments of society&#xD;
were bound up in the chains of a vast military&#xD;
despotism, the Roman church rall:c1 around the&#xD;
power which restored its fallen altars, and the&#xD;
enraptured Parisians worshipped their new idol.&#xD;
The capital resumed its ancient splendor-talent,&#xD;
art, and genius, no longer compelled to hide&#xD;
themselves in obscurity, were received into favor.&#xD;
Manufactures flourished, and France again saw&#xD;
plenty and prosperity reviving in her midst,&#xD;
effacing all vestiges of the long night of sorrow&#xD;
which had passed.&#xD;
Madame Bonaparte did much to ameliorate&#xD;
the condition of society, and to aid those who&#xD;
had suffered from the'Revolution., In this good&#xD;
work she employed Madame Wilmot and her&#xD;
son, furnishing them with unlimited means to&#xD;
succor all who returned from exile penniless.&#xD;
One da, Josephine entered Madame Wil-&#xD;
mot's room, dressed in a common garb, very&#xD;
different from her usual rich and tasteful costume.&#xD;
" 1 have taken the liberty of appointing an in-&#xD;
terview in your room, my dear madame," said&#xD;
she,&#xD;
" An interview ?"&#xD;
"Don't be shocked! It is with alady-a for-&#xD;
tune-teller-the celebrated Madame Le Normand.&#xD;
We shall hear if she endorses the statements of&#xD;
our old West Indian friend."&#xD;
Soon the pythoness was announced, a good&#xD;
looking, intelligent dame, of whom Josephine&#xD;
inquired:&#xD;
"Can you tell me if I am to remain long in&#xD;
my present condition ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
THE MAMELUKE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Madame Le Normand shuffled her mystical&#xD;
cards, and then examined them. After taking&#xD;
up three or four, she stopped, and gazed at&#xD;
Josephine.&#xD;
" Can it bd possible" she ejaculated.&#xD;
" Everything is possible to those who will,"&#xD;
was the reply.&#xD;
"Such, lady, is the motto of your chivalric&#xD;
husband, whose future elevation you now labor&#xD;
to attain. Success will follow-"&#xD;
"And I will really become a queen ?" inter-&#xD;
rupted Josephirie.&#xD;
"Alas, it is so written on the oracle, 'You&#xD;
will ascend a throne. The strength and power&#xD;
of your attending genius promise you a wonder-&#xD;
ful, an inconceivable destiny-but your husbandr.&#xD;
will one day forget his solemn vows. Unhappily,&#xD;
the greater be shall become, the 'more he will&#xD;
stoop to artifice, in order to attain hi's own ends."&#xD;
"Nay, nay," responded Josephine. "It can-&#xD;
not be that Napoleon will ever desert me. His&#xD;
fate is too closely linked with mine. To me,&#xD;
and not to him, did destiny promise a crown,&#xD;
and through me has he risen-'through me he&#xD;
will rise. Let him repulse me, and' he will fall."&#xD;
Months passed, and one day Osmanli came&#xD;
into his wife's room, where he found his mother.&#xD;
"Good news I" he exclaimed, tenderly em-&#xD;
bracing Judith.&#xD;
"What ?" asked both ladies.&#xD;
"1Why the day of the coronation is definitely&#xD;
fixed. Monsieur Le Brin, now second consul,&#xD;
is named treasurer of the imperial exchequer,&#xD;
and I have General Bonaparte's permission to&#xD;
retire. Now, dear mother, I can tread the soil&#xD;
of my ancestors, and with you and Judith, far&#xD;
removed from these gay and frivolous scenes, we&#xD;
can lead that life of quiet enjoyment for which,&#xD;
we have so long prayed."&#xD;
That was a happy evening for' the Wilmots;&#xD;
nor did Bonaparte display a more childish im-&#xD;
patience to grasp his imperial insignia, than did&#xD;
they to 'depart for the retirement of their forest&#xD;
home.&#xD;
At length the eventful day was -ushered in by&#xD;
the rbar of artillery, and soon there was such a&#xD;
display in the streets as the gay capital of France&#xD;
had never witnessed before. The high military&#xD;
and civil dignitaries of the empire, with the for-&#xD;
eign.ambassadors, and troops, formed a pageant&#xD;
unrivalled for ibagnificence. The interior of the&#xD;
cathedral had been sumptuously decorated, and&#xD;
its vast galleries were.thronged with titled spec-&#xD;
tators, in full dress, and resplendent with gold&#xD;
&#xD;
and jewels. The pope consecrated the imperial&#xD;
diadem, after which he presented it to Bonaparte,&#xD;
who placed it on his own head, then removed it&#xD;
to thehead of Josephine, and then again laid it&#xD;
upon the altar. .An anthem of praise was chant--&#xD;
ed, and then the heralds proclaimed that the'&#xD;
thrice glorious and august Napoleon had been&#xD;
crowned "Emperor of the French."  The accla-&#xD;
mations of the assembled 'multitude pealed as&#xD;
from the ocean, while the thousands without&#xD;
taking up the shout, all Paris echoed with "Long&#xD;
live Napoleon1"&#xD;
Joy and pleasure, that day, had dominion in&#xD;
France.&#xD;
The farewell audience was brief. Napoleon&#xD;
cordially thanked Osmanli for his faithful ser-&#xD;
vice, and entreated him'to return if he became&#xD;
dissatisfied with, America. Josephine had or-&#xD;
dered costly gifts for Madame Wilhot and Ju-&#xD;
dith. "Perhaps," she laughingly remarked,'as&#xD;
-they left, "you.may some day receive a visit&#xD;
froh me. Iam the child of destiny, ond there&#xD;
is no saying where the ocean of time may yet&#xD;
cast me."&#xD;
Leaving Paris, the emigrants repaired to Ha-&#xD;
vre, where, to their delight, they found their old&#xD;
friend, Jack Norman, in command of a vessel&#xD;
about to sail for Savannah. They at once en-&#xD;
gaged his cabin, and the vessel was nearly'&#xD;
freighted' with Osmauli's purchases, Books,&#xD;
furniture, agricultural implements, with many&#xD;
other things calculated to promote comfort, had&#xD;
been carefully selected, and a few trusty domes-&#xD;
tics were also taken. The Indians yet inhabited&#xD;
the region'where Osmanli proposed to settle-it&#xD;
was his father'slome-and civilization had made&#xD;
little progi-ess into the forest. So they went&#xD;
prepared to transplant their home coshforts, and&#xD;
to improve the social condition of their wild&#xD;
neighbors.&#xD;
The yoyage was short, but tempestuous, and&#xD;
the staunch old vessel had to struggle hard to&#xD;
surmount the mountain waves. . But they were&#xD;
bound to their home, the land of freedom, and&#xD;
did not complain. A$ last, they reached the&#xD;
mouth of the Savannah river, with its sentinel&#xD;

Norman, t&#xD;

city of Oglethorpe. The necessary&#xD;
ns were soon made for forwarding the&#xD;
and, bidding a hasty adieu to Jack&#xD;
ho party started for their forest-home.&#xD;

blood of hostile armies, but at the residence of&#xD;
the Wilmots all was repose, and happiness, and&#xD;
calm tranquillity. The mild and bprrevolent fea-&#xD;
tures of the old lady beamed with satisfaction,&#xD;
and her enjoyment was heightened by the clan-,&#xD;
nish respect paid to her son by the surviving&#xD;
Indians who had followed her husband in war&#xD;
and in peace. -Judith, a buxom  matron, sang&#xD;
to her infant prattler the songs with which she&#xD;
had once charmed the imperial warriors, and&#xD;
although time's unsparing hand had chastened&#xD;
&#xD;
the brilliancy of her beauty, it had brought out&#xD;
the deeper, purer, holier tints of her mind and of&#xD;
her countenance in stronger relief. As for Os-&#xD;
mnanli, a sphere of active usefulness had opened&#xD;
to him in the high duties - of an American citi-&#xD;
zen, and instead of dreaming away existence, he&#xD;
filled many important offices with credit to him-&#xD;
self and profit to his adopted country. Nor did&#xD;
he ever forget the deep debt of gratitude which&#xD;
he owed to the "mystic tie," for he owed every.&#xD;
thing-his life, his religion, his mother, his wife,&#xD;
his home, to the use of its "secret sign."&#xD;

TOM SMITM "could do anything." All his&#xD;
friends and companions believed inhis universal&#xD;
capacity, and he himself was satisfied of it; A&#xD;
dashing cleverness in whatever he attempted,&#xD;
made even his failures seem better evidence of&#xD;
genius than the success of other men. "~He&#xD;
might if he would," was the verdict of his ad-&#xD;
mirers. "I could do it,if I thought'it worth my&#xD;
while," was Tom's own consolation under re-&#xD;
verses and disappointments.&#xD;
At school he was chiefly remarkable for inat-&#xD;
tention to his studies, while an occasional bril-&#xD;
liant triumph, when all around expected com-&#xD;
plete disgrace, forced the admiration of teachers&#xD;
and pupils at his talents, and their regret at his&#xD;
neglect and abuse of them. He was content&#xD;
with such partial successes, and was, moreover,&#xD;
proud of his contempt for his own abilities,&#xD;
which others so much admired and envied. He&#xD;
delighted to show the plodders, as he called&#xD;
them, that the snail does not always-beat, in the&#xD;
race with the hare, as the fable teaches, though&#xD;
the snail does labor on continually, and the hare&#xD;
stops every now and then for a frolic at the&#xD;
brook-side. Such was the character which he&#xD;
carried from the school to the university. And&#xD;
when he was thence expelled for the eccentrici-&#xD;
ties of his genius, which were developed in a&#xD;
shower of stones against a professor's windows,&#xD;
he comforted himself with the distich:-- 1&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
"For more true joy Marcellus, exiled, feels,&#xD;
Than Csar, with a senate at his heels.",&#xD;
That, by the way, is a couplet which has been&#xD;
applied, with admirable originality, during every&#xD;
college rebellion, and the pstication. or expul-&#xD;
sion consequent, which have occurred since col-&#xD;
lege misconduct was first in fashion. Little&#xD;
consolation does it present, however, to the pa-&#xD;
rents whose hopes are defeated, and whose ex-&#xD;
pectations are disappointed by the misconduct&#xD;
of the son. Small promise of ;after usefulness&#xD;
do such beginnings afford,-little warrant of N&#xD;
reward for parental culture, in the life-harvest of&#xD;
-the boy.&#xD;
Now let us advance over the somewhat stale&#xD;
description of a-reckless youth to his maturer&#xD;
manhood. Despite of the prophecies of the&#xD;
comforters of his parents that the "ne'er-do-&#xD;
weel " Tom Smith, would "never come to any-&#xD;
thing," behold him admitted to the bar, with&#xD;
unusual honors. The shame of being taunted&#xD;
with his inefficiency had spurred him to such&#xD;
unwonted exertion and application, as developed&#xD;
his full strength. For once, Tom had done his&#xD;
best, and so triumphantly did he make his&#xD;
entree uponhis professional career, that it began&#xD;
to be suspected that he was unjustly misrepre-&#xD;
sented by those who asserted that he was idle&#xD;
and negligent at college. Business flowed in&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
upon him apace; and the novelty of his position, -I&#xD;
its excitement, in which he delighted, and the a&#xD;
pleasure of having asserted his ability by a vic- se&#xD;
tory over circumstances, set him up completely y&#xD;
in his own heart.                           a&#xD;
But his application did not long continue. s3&#xD;
The position which he had gained, as it were, at l&#xD;
a jump, he had not industry sufficient to retain d&#xD;
by hard labor; and hard labor only can main- li&#xD;
tain him who by accident, or a specious appear- n&#xD;
ance of fitness, beaches a place for which he is E&#xD;
really incompetent. Tom had genius but not e&#xD;
learning. He sported with the feelings of his i&#xD;
clients, as he had long been in the habit of doing o&#xD;
with his own ; and though he often sheceeded in t&#xD;
retrieving the affairs entrusted 'to him, by des- o&#xD;
perate plunges, at theeldse of long and weary e&#xD;
doubts, hi- clients were not so grateful for being h&#xD;
saved "by the skin of their teeth," as the pro- i&#xD;
verb expresses it, as Tom thought they should e&#xD;
have been. They did not relish being thrown b&#xD;
overboard, to display his skill in rescuing them&#xD;
from drowning; and if extrication from fearful&#xD;
dilemmas did minister to Tom's triumphs, they&#xD;
could not forget that his carelessness had placed 1&#xD;
them in their difficulties. They did not like&#xD;
that their causes and their property should be j&#xD;
put in peril by his negligeice, in order that the 1&#xD;
hair-breadth victory should exalt his reputation; I&#xD;
and would far rather that a little of the plodding t&#xD;
industry which he despised should secure them&#xD;
from the first. than that they should come in vie&#xD;
tors at the last, by a coup dermain. It resulted,&#xD;
at last, that Thomas Smith, Esq., was avoided&#xD;
as coune-el by careful men,~but was summonelI&#xD;
in desperate cases, which none other pared to&#xD;
undertake. Under such a stimulus he was al-I&#xD;
most uniformly successful; and thus, without&#xD;
the true requisites of a sound jurist, he had a&#xD;
conqueror's reputation, and a fitful, though, on&#xD;
the whole, a lucative practice.  There is a&#xD;
western boast which illustrates' thb life of such&#xD;
men. He could fall lower, and still rise, or, as&#xD;
the phrase is, "dive deeper and come up drier"&#xD;
than -almost any other. It was' always dark&#xD;
night or bright sunshine with him-a fearful&#xD;
storm  or a dead calm.&#xD;
At length it occurred that some business in&#xD;
which he was engaged required the intervention,&#xD;
of the Legislature. His presence at the capital&#xD;
was required to expedite it. One proposition in'&#xD;
the consultations with his .clients led to another,&#xD;
until'it was suggested that it were better to elect&#xD;
him as a representative, than to depute him as a&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
bby member. The matter was talked over,&#xD;
nd as those of the public who knew the secret&#xD;
aw no particular fitness in the election of a law-&#xD;
er with half-a-dozen clients in a particular case,&#xD;
s his actual constituency, there were strong&#xD;
ymptoms of opposition., But this only stimu-&#xD;
ated him. It spurred his energy, and fixed his&#xD;
etermination to be elected, for though he cared&#xD;
little for the honor, and knew the profit was&#xD;
othing, to be opposed was to ensure his success.&#xD;
le threw himself into the work with his.whole&#xD;
nergy, and after vigorous canvassing, caucus-&#xD;
ng and exertion, he was returned by a majority&#xD;
f ten votes; a much more acceptable triumph&#xD;
o him than if he had been elected'by a majority&#xD;
f ten hundred. To have been unanimously&#xD;
elected would have possessed no charms for&#xD;
im; and had the reception of his nomination&#xD;
ndicated an appearance of unanimity among the&#xD;
lectors in his favor, we do believe he would&#xD;
have declined the intended honor.&#xD;
In the Legislature he,was true to his old char-&#xD;
acter. He was placed at the head of an impor-&#xD;
tant committee, in compliment to his reputation,&#xD;
but his committee work was really nothing. In&#xD;
drawing up reports and investigating the sub.&#xD;
ects referred, he had absolutely no share. But&#xD;
his " genius " stood him-in good stead, for with&#xD;
his powerful natural abilities, he could astonish&#xD;
those who drew up the reports, by making a bet&#xD;
ter defence than they; and his skillful ad cap-&#xD;
tandun hits and witty repartees, his unbounded&#xD;
assurance and wonderful readiness completed&#xD;
the work which others had begun, and made&#xD;
him who was really the cipher in the. business&#xD;
seem the character, by whom only the others&#xD;
had significance. Tom was delighted with'legis-&#xD;
lation. It was, as he managed it, a glorious,&#xD;
continual contest against odds, which ma'de his&#xD;
fame ring again, and he was really almost de-&#xD;
eived into the belief that he was a statesman.&#xD;
I But the Hon. Mr. Smith's course was not all&#xD;
sunshine. His old carelessness threw him into&#xD;
a.troublesome difficulty. He was absent from&#xD;
his post when a decisive vote was taken upon&#xD;
the very question which he had been elected to&#xD;
carry-and he was horrified one morning to find&#xD;
that his opponents'had taken advantage of his&#xD;
absence to defeat his clients. Great and terrible&#xD;
*as the wrath of his friends, and even Tom&#xD;
Smith-lucky Tom Smith-appeared at last in&#xD;
a lane which seemed' 'to have no turn. 'He saw&#xD;
no mode in which he could retrieve himself, and&#xD;
no excuses presented themselves with which he&#xD;

could face his friends. It was such a palpable&#xD;
and unpardonable fault, so grossly inexcusable,&#xD;
that even our -hero was ready to despair- But&#xD;
his good fortune did not yet desert him. One of&#xD;
the "plodders "-and genius is often more in-&#xD;
debted to the plodders than the world'suspects-&#xD;
saved him from destruction. A careful, old,&#xD;
dull-headed tactitian, who was in the same inter-&#xD;
est with Smith, voted against him, in order to&#xD;
secure a right to move a "reconsideration."&#xD;
This was opening enough for Smith. it was a&#xD;
breach in the enemy's defences, into which he&#xD;
threw himself; and, with his old'success, turned&#xD;
the tables, and came off with flying colors, and&#xD;
more admiration than ever. But hehad given,&#xD;
also, an endorsement of his 'old character, that&#xD;
he was "inot fit to be trusted."&#xD;
The session wore away, but the Hon. Mr.&#xD;
Smith had lost his interest in the public business.&#xD;
It bad no more charms for him. The great ex-&#xD;
citement was over, and he turned with distaste&#xD;
from the formal phraseology of acts to repeal&#xD;
acts, acts, to modify acts, acts to continue acts,&#xD;
and all the forasmuches, whereases, preambles,&#xD;
chapters ard sections of routine law-making.&#xD;
He sought excitement somewhere else-and&#xD;
found it. Where?&#xD;
Thereby hangs a tale-or rather the moral of&#xD;
our tale. The kef to the Hon Mr. Smith's&#xD;
strange negligence-was the same that will too&#xD;
often explain the "aberrations of genius." He&#xD;
was fond of deep potations and of luxurious&#xD;
food. He liked the wit and excitement of the&#xD;
dinner table, and the supper. He was thq soul&#xD;
of-convivial parties, and was prone to the et cet-&#xD;
eras which fill up the days of those whose nights&#xD;
are given to revelry, the excitement of the bil-&#xD;
liard room  and the bowling alley, the early&#xD;
mingling of strong drink  Ii these scenes he&#xD;
could shine 'without effort. Ready applause and&#xD;
hearty appreciation followed all the sallies of so&#xD;
distinguished a convive.. To such haunts and to&#xD;
such companions he was ready to fly, not only&#xD;
from the fatigue of his profession, but to escape&#xD;
that fatigue before he incurred it. -&#xD;
The Hon. Mr. Smith would have quietly re-&#xD;
tired from public life entirely, at the cloie of his&#xD;
first term, but there were two reasons against it.&#xD;
Onewas, that he liked the license of the capital&#xD;
-the other, that he foind " public sentiment'"&#xD;
so unanimous against his reelection, that to de-&#xD;
dine to contend would be a.palpable defeat. In&#xD;
neglecting the business of the House, he had&#xD;
suffered the district which he represented to-lose'&#xD;
&#xD;
some important advantages, and the people&#xD;
were no$ at all disposed to forgive him. Again&#xD;
he nerved himself for the contest. Again he&#xD;
succeeded. Defeat would have beenbetter for'&#xD;
him.&#xD;
We must spare the reader the aiarrative of all&#xD;
the downward steps by which the Hon. Thomas&#xD;
Smith became a sot. The first steps in this&#xD;
path were taken many years before. In his&#xD;
youth and college days, his dangerous passion&#xD;
for praise,~and fondness for unwise excitement,&#xD;
had betrayed him into the love of drink,'and if&#xD;
conscience or some considerate friend warned&#xD;
him to beware, the deceptive promise was ready&#xD;
"0, I cannot sink! I recover myself too&#xD;
easily." The recklessness of danger which&#xD;
grows out of over-bonfidence-the estimate of&#xD;
his own powers which maade him despise the&#xD;
fear of being taken at a disadvantage, ruined&#xD;
Tom Smith, as it has ruined many more. The&#xD;
pride which exalts in self debasement (not abase-&#xD;
ment), in order that it may be shown from how&#xD;
low a depth to rise is possible, is much more&#xD;
common than is usually imagined. There is&#xD;
scarce an outcast in.the world who does not im-&#xD;
agine that he could re-establish himself, if only&#xD;
he thought it worth his while, and would set&#xD;
about it!&#xD;
Down! Down! The elasticity of the strong.&#xD;
est must give way at last, and the mind sympa-&#xD;
thizes with the besotted, as well as with the vig-&#xD;
orous body. We have not mentioned Smith's&#xD;
wife, butit must not therefore be inferred that&#xD;
he had none. Women are admirers of the bril-&#xD;
liant and the bold; and each of Tom's hair-&#xD;
breadth successes would fhave procured him a&#xD;
wife, if it were the custom of the country thus to&#xD;
multiply.  That his disgrace and excesses&#xD;
brought unhappiness upon her and misfortune&#xD;
upon his children, is the old story of every ine-&#xD;
briate's home.&#xD;
At last he was given over. Even his wife-&#xD;
and wives hope to the last-had ceased to expect&#xD;
that he could recover, or that, from the deep, dis-&#xD;
grace into-which he had plunged, there wasany&#xD;
expectation of his emerging. He still bad pro-&#xD;
fessional business., Pickpockets with more&#xD;
aliases than changes of garments,; inebriates, to&#xD;
whose names "drunk and disorderly "'w   as&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
the Hon. Thomas Smith "appeared for the de-&#xD;
fendant." He often- astonished those who had,.&#xD;
aid those who had 'not known him in better&#xD;
days, by managing petty cases with a skill wor-&#xD;
thy of a better arena. This was triumph&#xD;
enough for him! Tell him he could do better if&#xD;
he would, and he would acknowledge the com-&#xD;
pliment with such a full appreciation of its&#xD;
truthfulness, as, indicated that he considered it&#xD;
unnecessary labor to make the trial.&#xD;
It so chanced one day, that he heard himself&#xD;
discussed, when the interlocutors were not aware&#xD;
that he was listening. And he heard them,&#xD;
moreover, reach the calm and sad conclusion&#xD;
'that he wds sunken past recall or recovery.&#xD;
They agreed that he had so wasted his energy&#xD;
and impaired his strength, mental and physical,&#xD;
that further expectation for him there was none,&#xD;
except that he would die like a drunken swan-&#xD;
if such a bird were possible-in singing in bac-&#xD;
chine eloquence his own defence against being&#xD;
committed as a vagrant.&#xD;
"Perhaps so," said Smith. A new resolve&#xD;
was awakened in him. People doubted that he&#xD;
could overcome temptation. He would see!&#xD;
From that moment he put the resolve in prac-,&#xD;
tiee. It was the most severe struggle he had&#xD;
ever undertaken, but his re-awakened pride, sec-&#xD;
onded by a strong will, was triumphant. He&#xD;
raised himself from the kennel, -as he had prom-&#xD;
&#xD;
83&#xD;
&#xD;
ised himself he would, and ended life where he&#xD;
should have commenced it, a sober man.&#xD;
But where, meanwhile, were the "plodders,"&#xD;
the snails, as he used to style them,.when he&#xD;
likened himself to the hare? All in positions of&#xD;
competence and ease, which he could never hope&#xD;
to reach. They had gained in the long race,&#xD;
though often and often he had frolicked past them&#xD;
in derision. Man cannot always retain his&#xD;
youth, and premature old age settles hard upon&#xD;
him, even though he be a genius, who lives too&#xD;
fast. Let the young and over-confident, the apt&#xD;
and able, especially, beware how they waste&#xD;
their lives and trifle with their powers. It is'&#xD;
agreeable to astonish o'ne's friends, and to disap-&#xD;
point one's foes ; but it is not safe to do it at&#xD;
your own expense. Feeble old Justice Shallows&#xD;
may chuckle over the irregularities of their&#xD;
youth, but it is better,*while the page is fair, to&#xD;
make no blurs upon it. It is very much to a&#xD;
man's credit to reform from vice or dissipation,&#xD;
bit it is better--as the good book advises us re-&#xD;
specting contention-to leave such things off be-&#xD;
fore they be meddled with. Hon. Thomas&#xD;
Smith will tell you so, though he has been so&#xD;
long, of later years, in good repute, that his&#xD;
younger friends do not remember when he stood&#xD;
otherwise. Genius, unguided by abiding princi-&#xD;
ple, and unaccomanied by industry, is a dan-&#xD;
gerous gift.&#xD;

THE COUNTRY DEALER AND HIS CLERK.&#xD;
BY SYLVANUS COBB, JR.&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. ELIAS RANDALL kept one of those large&#xD;
stores so common in flourishing country towns,&#xD;
where, every article of proptree is bought from&#xD;
the farmers round about, and where every kind&#xD;
of goods usually needed in the country is kept&#xD;
forsale. He was a sharp-featured, shrewd-looking&#xD;
man, somewhat turned of- fifty, and hard as a&#xD;
diamond at a trade. He could buy the best o&#xD;
-pro4uce at the cheapest rates, and 'he could sell&#xD;
his auction-bought goods at alarmingly high&#xD;
prices. In short, he never failed to make a&#xD;
round profit at both ends of a bargain. He did&#xD;
not hesitate to overstep the'bounds of honesty&#xD;
when he had a fair chance, though he always did&#xD;
it in such a manner that his old adage " A bar&#xD;
gain is a baiain " would safely shield him.&#xD;
"Lyman," said he to his son, one day, a&#xD;
young man some ,twenty years of age, and al-&#xD;
most the counterpart of his father, save that he&#xD;
showed more -recklessness of disposition, "did&#xD;
you make a trade with farmer Jones ?"&#xD;
Yes."&#xD;
"What did you charge him for that sugar and&#xD;
tea?-&#xD;
"Ninepence for the sugar, and half a dollar,&#xD;
for the tea. Made him believe 'twas extra nice,&#xD;
you see.-&#xD;
"That's right. And what did you 'charge&#xD;
him for the coffee V"&#xD;
&#xD;
AiAh, there I had him! I made the old man&#xD;
believe 'twas extra old Java-charged him fifteen&#xD;
cents."&#xD;
"Pretty good, my son, only you might have&#xD;
put on the half cent. You see you can make a&#xD;
great point out of that.- When you come the&#xD;
half cents over them they think you are shaving&#xD;
closer down to cost. But you did very well,&#xD;
Lyman. Now what did you allow Jones for his&#xD;
beans ?"&#xD;
"Seven an' sixpence."&#xD;
"0, you shouldn't havA done that. A dol-&#xD;
lar, or dollar an' ntnepence would have been&#xD;
enough."&#xD;
"But they were nice ones, father; carefully&#xD;
picked and clean."-0&#xD;
"You should have made him believe they&#xD;
were poorer.",&#xD;
"1But how 1"&#xD;
" Why,when you found the old man had&#xD;
beans to exchange for his goods, you should have&#xD;
taken 'a handful of poor ones from one of our&#xD;
barrels,vand watched your opportunity to scatter&#xD;
them over the top of his. Don't you under-&#xD;
stand 1"&#xD;
"cYes, I see now., father."&#xD;

tomer when you can, but be careful and keep the "You need not open your books this morning,&#xD;
&#xD;
bright side out."&#xD;
This was the way the father taught his son,&#xD;
and how that son profited by it the sequel will&#xD;
show.&#xD;
" By the way, Lymah," continued the old&#xD;
man, " I have discovered who it is that has been&#xD;
robbing my money-drawer."&#xD;
"1Ah !" uttered the son, turning at that mo-&#xD;
ment to arrange a piece of calico, which didn't&#xD;
need any fixing at all. "And who is it ?"&#xD;
"Wilton Cunningham."&#xD;
"Ishouldn't wonder in thts least. I never&#xD;
liked the fellow, and I have often wondered&#xD;
what made you keep him."               I&#xD;
"I wouldn't have kept him, only that he is&#xD;
such a remarkably smart book-keeper, and such&#xD;
a beautiful writer, too. He aint fit to trade."&#xD;
"No; you can never make him believe it's&#xD;
right to drive a snug trade. 'But how did you&#xD;
manage to detect him ?"&#xD;
"I'll tell you," returned the old man. "Last&#xD;
week I took particular notice of some silver'dol-&#xD;
lars that were in the money-drawer, and, deter-&#xD;
mined that I would, set a trap for the thief. I&#xD;
took four of the pieces' and crossed them very&#xD;
carefully, and in such a manner that one not ac-&#xD;
quainted with the secret would not be likely to&#xD;
notice it; then I put them back into' the drawer.&#xD;
Next morning one of them was gone, and as all&#xD;
our trade the day before had been barter or cre-'&#xD;
dit, I knew that it could not have been given in&#xD;
change. Of course my suspicions fell upon&#xD;
Wilton, and I at once began to look about to see&#xD;
where he had spent money, and I found' that he&#xD;
had paid Mr. Willey for his mother's rent. I&#xD;
went to Mr. Willey, and asked to see the money&#xD;
Wilton had paid him, and I found my crossed&#xD;
dollar among it. It's as plain as daylight."&#xD;
"Certainly it is," said Lyman.   .&#xD;
"There can be no doubt about it," added the&#xD;
old man; in a confident tone, and then, with a&#xD;
sarcastic sneer, he said: "His seeming honesty&#xD;
is all the result of fear. He dares not make a&#xD;
hold trade, but he can steal in the dprk, though."&#xD;
Just then a customer entered, and while Mr.&#xD;
1Randall was trading with him, Wilton Cunning-&#xD;
hai came in. The latter was not over one-and-&#xD;
twenty, and though "appearances are deceitful,"&#xD;
yet it would be hard work to make a physiogno-&#xD;
mist believe that he could be capable of theft.&#xD;
The young clerk went immediately to his desk,.&#xD;
and as soon as Mr. Randall was at liberty, he&#xD;
joined him,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
sir," said the trader.&#xD;
The young man looked around in surprise.&#xD;
"-Mr. Cunningham," continued Rapdall, "I&#xD;
have discovered who it is that has been for so&#xD;
long a time robbing my money-drawer."&#xD;
"Ah I!"&#xD;
"Yes, sir. I have trapped him, and you may&#xD;
judge of my surprise upon finding it to be none&#xD;
other than Wilton Cunningham."&#xD;
"Do you mean me, sir ?" uttered the young&#xD;
man, stepping down from his stool and boldly&#xD;
facing his accuser.&#xD;
"Of course I do, and I have proof of what I&#xD;
say."&#xD;
"No man, Mr. Randall, can produce a proof&#xD;
of dishonesty in me."&#xD;
"Not quite so fast, sir. Did you not pay to&#xD;
Mr. Willey the rent for the house which your&#xD;
mother occupies ?"&#xD;
"I did, sir."&#xD;
"And did you not give him this dollar ?"&#xD;
asked Mr. Randall, producing the dollar he had&#xD;
crossed.&#xD;
''I might have done it, sir, for I paid him sev-&#xD;
eral silver dollars."&#xD;
" Ay,",returned the old man, with a sort of&#xD;
triumphant look, "and that dollar was stolen&#xD;
from my drawer last Wednesday night, and you&#xD;
paid it away on the same night. Now, how came&#xD;
you by it ?"&#xD;
"If I paid it to Mr. Willey-"&#xD;
"But you did pay it to him. He can swear&#xD;
to that."&#xD;
" Then, sir, I know not where I got it. I had&#xD;
several of them. Some my mother has taken for&#xD;
butter and cheese, and some I have laid away."&#xD;
"Yes, some you have laid away I That dol-&#xD;
lar, sir, you took from my drawer last Wednes-&#xD;
day evening. You stole it I"&#xD;
" Mr. Randall," said Wilton, in a tone of calm&#xD;
indignity, "I -hardly know how to meet your&#xD;
charge. To deny it would be only to contradict&#xD;
you; but I do deny it, and I call on God to wit-&#xD;
ness that I never, to my knowledge, wronged a&#xD;
man to the amount of a cent. I shall see Mr.&#xD;
Willey, sir."&#xD;
"Do so. I will go with you at once."&#xD;
Accordingly Mr. Randall and his clerk set off.&#xD;
They found Mr. Willey, and that gentleman,&#xD;
though he felt much friendship for the young&#xD;
man, dould not but declare that the crossed dol-&#xD;
lar had been received from him. Wilton could&#xD;
not deny it; he had not noticed any particular&#xD;

THE CROSSED DOLLAR.                  87\&#xD;
&#xD;
marks upon the money he hid paid, and he could&#xD;
only reiterate the assertion that he had not taken&#xD;
it from his employer's drawer. He felt grieved&#xD;
to see that a shade of suspicion rested upon the&#xD;
face of Mr. Willey, and he then saw how strong&#xD;
was the evidence against him. He turned away&#xD;
to hide the tear that started from his eye, and his&#xD;
heart swelled with a painful emotion.&#xD;
" Is 'Squire Bullard at home ?" asked Mr.&#xD;
Randall, after the facts in the case had been auf-&#xD;
ficiently discussed.  ^&#xD;
"No. He's gone down to Portland, but he'll&#xD;
be at home to-night," returned Mr. Willey.&#xD;
" Good heavens! Mr. Randall, you do not&#xD;
mean to make a legal investigation of this case?"&#xD;
cried Wilton, turning pale and trembling like an&#xD;
aspen.&#xD;
"Most assuredly I do," calmly returned the&#xD;
trader. "If you are innocent you will have no-&#xD;
- thing to fear.",&#xD;
"And suppose I cannot prove that innocence ?"&#xD;
" That's just what I'm afraid of," half ironi-&#xD;
cally returned Randall.&#xD;
"0 God !" ejaculated the youth, clasping his&#xD;
hands together in tortured'agony. "What have&#xD;
I done that I should come to this ?"&#xD;
Mr. Willey began to show evident signs of re-&#xD;
pentance that he Jiad been instrumental in bring-&#xD;
ing this about, and as liandall noticed it, he&#xD;
made haste to cut the meeting short.&#xD;
"You need not go back to the store with me,"&#xD;
he said to his clerk, "but I shall see you this&#xD;
evening."&#xD;
Wilton Cunningham turned his steps home&#xD;
ward, but his walk was slow and sad. He knew&#xD;
the disposition of Mr. Randall, that he was hard&#xD;
hearted, grasping, avaricious, and capable ol&#xD;
doing anything that might answer his own ends&#xD;
but he knew not then all the ends the trader ha&#xD;
in view-ends which will be easily understoo&#xD;
by a slight conversation at the store.&#xD;
" Lyman," said Mr. Randall, after he had re&#xD;
turned from Mr. Willey's, "I've got young&#xD;
Cunningham hard and 'fast. The evidence I&#xD;
clear, and if Bullard gets home before dark,'II&#xD;
have him examined and bound over for trial&#xD;
this very night."&#xD;
- But you don't'really mean to try Wilton fo&#xD;
thet, do youi" asked Lyman.&#xD;
"Of course I do, Do you suppose : ma&#xD;
shall rob we with ishpunity "&#xD;
"But you might tur him off, father, andl kee&#xD;
back hislatkquarter's salary."T,&#xD;
-" You don't know all, Lywan. The youn&#xD;
&#xD;
fellow might have been likely, hadn't this thing&#xD;
have turned up, to have proved a angerous&#xD;
rival to us."&#xD;
"How so, father ?"&#xD;
"By setting up an opposition store."&#xD;
"But he hasn't the capital "&#xD;
"He can raise it, though. That old Jones&#xD;
that was in here this morning has offered to lend&#xD;
him two thousand dollars, and others have offer-&#xD;
ed to advance him money if he will open a new&#xD;
store."&#xD;
"That would be rather dangerous business&#xD;
for you," remarked Lyman, 'in a thoughtful&#xD;
mood.&#xD;
"But he 'wont, do it now," the old man re-&#xD;
turned, with considerable satisfaction. "This&#xD;
thing will shut him up."-&#xD;
When Wilton reached his home, he found his&#xD;
mother sitting in her front room, and he at once&#xD;
told her all that had passed. She was horror-&#xD;
struck, but not for a single instant did she enter-&#xD;
tain a question with regard to the entire inno-&#xD;
cence of her dear boy. She was confident that&#xD;
all the money she had given her son towards&#xD;
paying the rent she had received from Portland,&#xD;
and that she had had it in her possession for&#xD;
several weeks before.it was thus paid out.&#xD;
The conversation between the mother and&#xD;
child was long and earnest, but they could find&#xD;
no clue to the. solving of the difficulty. All&#xD;
looked dark and gloomy.&#xD;
After dinner, Wilton put on his hat and took&#xD;
a few turns in the garden. He seemed to be&#xD;
struggling with 'some strong desire, and more&#xD;
than once he laid his hand upon the latch of the&#xD;
- gate, and then turned and went back again. At&#xD;
f length he placed his hand upon his brow, and&#xD;
muttered a few incoherent sentences to himself.&#xD;
d When he looked up again, he was pale and sad,&#xD;
d but appeared no longer undecided. He opened&#xD;
the gate and passed out into the street, and turn-&#xD;
ing to the left he walked away from the village.&#xD;
g At the distance of half a mile, he came to a&#xD;
s small white farm house,.where lived 1Mr. Drake,&#xD;
l one of the thriftiest farmers in the town, and as&#xD;
tl he turned up the pink-bordered walk that led to&#xD;
the door, he was met by a happy,'laughing,&#xD;
r beautiful girl whocaume running out to meet him.&#xD;
"Why, what is the-matter, dear Wilton ?" she&#xD;
in exclaimed, as se noticed the pallor that; oyer.&#xD;
spread his features.&#xD;
p   "Come into the house and I will tell you,"he&#xD;
retpraed.-&#xD;

4'&#xD;
44'&#xD;
444&#xD;
&#xD;
and walked with lim up through the-garden.&#xD;
When they reached the sitting-room, Wilton&#xD;
Cunningham closed the dpor, and then taking a&#xD;
seat, he drew Alice to his side, and told her all&#xD;
that had transpired. His voice was firm, for he&#xD;
had schooled himself to the task.&#xD;
"And now," he' continued,*as he finished his&#xD;
story, "I-have thought, Alice, that it would be&#xD;
better for me to tell you this than to have it come&#xD;
to you from other lips. I know not how it will&#xD;
turh out, but I fear that I shall be unable to dis-&#xD;
prove Mr. Randall's charge. In all probability&#xD;
I shall this eveningbe called before 'Squire Bul-&#xD;
lard for examination,, and the event cannot but&#xD;
cast a foul stain upon my reputation. It is a&#xD;
Painful thing to be situated thus, for others must&#xD;
stiffer besides myself; but you, Alice, I would&#xD;
free from-"&#xD;
Wilton hesitated and wiped a tear from his&#xD;
eye, but he soon gained his self-possession,&#xD;
though his voice faltered as he continued:&#xD;
" You know our^ relations, dear Alice, but if&#xD;
this stain falls upon me, I must. release you&#xD;
from your vows. One so pure as you should&#xD;
not be united with a man upon whose name even&#xD;
a suspicion of crime can fasten itself. It is like&#xD;
taking my life itself thus to-"&#xD;
" Hold, Wilton," uttered the fair girl, who&#xD;
had managed thus far to keep back her tears.&#xD;
"Are you guilty of this thing ?"&#xD;
"It is cruel to ask me that, Alice."&#xD;
"I ask it, nevertheless."&#xD;
"As there is a God who hears me now, the'&#xD;
thought, even, of such a crime never entered my&#xD;
mind. The person does not live who can say&#xD;
with truth that I ever wronged him yr her."&#xD;
"I believe you," returned Alice. laying her&#xD;
hand upon Wilton's shoulder and gazing affec-&#xD;
tionately into his face. "I know you, and know-&#xD;
ing you as I do, I shall never forsake you.&#xD;
When I promised to be yours for life, I did it&#xD;
upon mature'deliberation, nor did I mean that&#xD;
the first time the cold breath of slander or sus-&#xD;
picion fell upon you, that I should throw you&#xD;
off. "&#xD;
"Noble, generous girl I" murmured Wilton,&#xD;
as he wound his arm itbout her, "this takes&#xD;
away half the sting; but you must remember&#xD;
well what you do." -&#xD;
" I know what I would do, Wilteois  Ah, if I&#xD;
could forsake you in your trouble, how unwor,&#xD;
thy should I be of the sacred oice of wife!&#xD;
But tell me, have you no suspicious? You say&#xD;
that for scne time varied smel muas of money&#xD;
have been taken from Randall'e drawer."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Yes, dearest; for over a year there have&#xD;
frequently been discrepancies between our cash&#xD;
record and the- amount in the drawer; but, in&#xD;
many cases,-it has been the result of Mr. Ran-&#xD;
dall's own carelessness in taking money during&#xD;
the day for small purchases without giving a&#xD;
minute of it; but, in some instances, I know&#xD;
that money has been stolen."&#xD;
" And have you no suspicions of who took&#xD;
it ?" asked lice, with much earnestness.&#xD;
"I do ntknow who took it, and it would be&#xD;
ungenerous to tell of mere suspicions."&#xD;
" Well, I have my suspicions," said Alice.&#xD;
"I was in the store after you went away to sup-&#xD;
per last Wednesday evening, and I waited some.&#xD;
time for you to come back, but I got tired; so I&#xD;
came away without seeing lou."&#xD;
" Well," uttered the young man, in almost&#xD;
breathless axiidety, "did you see anything out of&#xD;
the way '"&#xD;
' Not that I know of; but, while I was there,&#xD;
I saw Mr. Randall go away from the desk where&#xD;
you write, and put some heavy pieces of silver&#xD;
into the money-drawer, and when he went out&#xD;
of the store, I went too, for I did not like to re-&#xD;
main after he had gone."*'&#xD;
"That was probably the money he marked,&#xD;
and it was after he had gone home that that mo-&#xD;
ney was taken, for when the drawer - was taken&#xD;
out of the safe, the next morning, he says it was&#xD;
gone; and it was after that, too, that I paid hir.&#xD;
Willey."&#xD;
For some time Alice Drake sat in deep thought.&#xD;
Her fingers' ends were placed upon her brow,&#xD;
and weighty ideas seemed revolving in her mind.&#xD;
At length she raised her head, and in a hopeful&#xD;
tone, she said:&#xD;
" You have many friends, Wilton, and some&#xD;
who may help you in this emergency. I will&#xD;
myself seek them. Ah, there goes 'Squire Bul-&#xD;
lard now. You had better return to your own&#xD;
cottage, and, trust me,' a woman's wit may be a&#xD;
match for them all."&#xD;
"But I cannot consent to this, Alice, that you&#xD;
shouldl-"&#xD;
"Let me have my own way this time," inter-&#xD;
'-upted Alice, " and I assure you that you shall&#xD;
not often find me so stubborn. The merest ac-&#xD;
cident in-the world may'turn the whole current&#xD;
of affairs."&#xD;
" Well, be it as you like," returned Wiltpn,&#xD;
as he arose from his-seat, "though it will be a&#xD;
lucky accident that nettles this in ay favor,&#xD;
though God knows it would be a just one."&#xD;

THE CROSSED DOLLAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
Shortly afterwards young Cunningham kissed&#xD;
Aliceb, and then turned his steps towards -his&#xD;
home. He had been in the house but a short&#xD;
time before he saw Alice ride past alone in her&#xD;
father's wagon. He had not yet dared to tell&#xD;
his mother that he expected to be taken to a&#xD;
lawyer's office, and rather than she should know&#xD;
of it till the result had appeared, he resolved to&#xD;
seek Mr. Randall ere he should be sent fdr, and&#xD;
with this view he told his mother merely that he&#xD;
was going to the store, and then left the house.&#xD;
Before he reached the store, however, he met the&#xD;
deputy-sheriff;yWho already held an order for his&#xD;
arrest, Mr. Randall having entered a complaint.&#xD;
It was not until after dark that Wilton Cun&#xD;
ningham was conveyed to the office of Mr.,Bul-&#xD;
lIkd, and'when he arrived he found not only his&#xD;
accuser and his witness there, but also several of&#xD;
the towns-people besides.&#xD;
Those who know anything about the prelimi-&#xD;
nary examination of a complaint in one of our&#xD;
country lawyers' offices, understand pretty well&#xD;
the latitude that is generally given to not only&#xD;
witnesses, but also to plaintiff and defendant.&#xD;
Mr. Bullard opened by reading Mr. Randall's&#xD;
charge, to which Wilon, of 'course, responded&#xD;
"not guilty." "Randall then made his statement&#xD;
in full. His son, Ly-man, was called upon to&#xD;
testify to the fact that money had frequently been&#xD;
stolen from his drawer. Just as young Randall&#xD;
was delivering his testimony with a brazen-faced,&#xD;
off-handed manner, old farmer Jones entered' the&#xD;
office, followed by Alice Drake and Mark Loud,&#xD;
the latter of whomwas a hostler in Mr. Willey's&#xD;
stable.%&#xD;
Randall felt uneasy when he saw Jones enter,&#xD;
for he did not like the man at all; but Lyman&#xD;
betrayed the most trepidation, and for why will&#xD;
-shortly be seen.&#xD;
Mr. Willey was then called upon for his evi-&#xD;
dence, which he gave with precision and confi-&#xD;
dence. '&#xD;
" This thing looks rather dark," remarked&#xD;
Mr. Bullard, bending a sort of compassionate&#xD;
look upon Wilton.&#xD;
"'Squire," said farmer Jones, in his usual&#xD;
blunt way, rising slowly to his feet, "I don't&#xD;
know much about your law regulations, but I&#xD;
'spose you wouldn't have no objections to my&#xD;
asking a few questions just about as I've a mind&#xD;
. to'e"&#xD;
" Certainly not," returned the lawyer, with an&#xD;
. air bf deference, for farmer Jones was one of the&#xD;
most honest, upright and influential men in the&#xD;
town.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, then, 'squire; 'bout an hour ago Miss-&#xD;
Alice Drake come driving' up to my house, an'&#xD;
asked me if I didn't remember of bein' in Ran-&#xD;
dall's store last Wednesday night, an', of course,&#xD;
I remember it, though I don't 'spose I should&#xD;
ever have thought of it again in the world, if she&#xD;
hadn't ave mentioned it. . Well, I come right'&#xD;
down with her, and a tween us both we've got&#xD;
up considerable of a story. Now, I should just&#xD;
like to ask Mr. Randall where his son was Sun-&#xD;
day 'fore last."&#xD;
"  was at P-- Hill, to attend meeting all&#xD;
day," returned Randall; but when he saw how&#xD;
his son trembled, he evinced some Istrong mis-&#xD;
givings on that point.&#xD;
" Rayther guess you're mistaken on that&#xD;
point," said Jones. "I saw him an' old Samp-&#xD;
son's boy, with one of Mr. Willey's. wagons,&#xD;
postin' off airly in the mornin' in another direc-&#xD;
tion; an', if I aint mistaken, they spent a good&#xD;
part of the day on Thompson's Pond a fishin'."&#xD;
Mr. Randall turned sharply upon his son, and&#xD;
asked if that was true. Lyman at first denied&#xD;
the gentle insinuation, but, at length, he was&#xD;
obliged to own it.&#xD;
" Well, that's so much gained," continued&#xD;
Jones and then, with lawyer-like tact, he turn-&#xD;
ed to Mr. Willey. "Mr. Willey," said lie, "how&#xD;
do you know that Wilton Cunningham gave you&#xD;
that crossed dollar that Randall lost out of his&#xD;
drawer ?"&#xD;
"Because no one else paid 'me any such mo-&#xD;
ney on that day, answered Willey.&#xD;
"Where did you put that money when you&#xD;
got itV-"&#xD;
'In my drawer."&#xD;
"And doesn't somebody else ever go to that&#xD;
drawer?",,&#xD;
"N~o one but Mark Loud."&#xD;
"Well," continued Jones, "last Wednesday&#xD;
night I left my horse in your shed, and after the&#xD;
store was shut up I went after him, and just as I&#xD;
was onhitchin' him, Mr. Lyman Randall steps&#xD;
in and pays Mark Loud for-the horse he had the&#xD;
Sunday before, though he didn't notice me when&#xD;
he 'did it. When I turned into the street,'I saw&#xD;
Alice Drake, an' I offered to carry her home,&#xD;
though I had to go some distance out of my way.&#xD;
As we were riding along, we got to speaking&#xD;
about Randall, an' I told her all about Lyman's&#xD;
ridin' off Sundays, an' that's the way she hap-&#xD;
pened to hit on me in this case."&#xD;
"But what has all this to do with my com-&#xD;
plaint ?" asked Randall, in considerable passion.&#xD;
&#xD;
Arl&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CROSS]&#xD;
"Only just this," returned Jones, with a pecu- I&#xD;
liar leer:  It was your son that paid that&#xD;
crossed dollar !&#xD;
"It's a fact," said Mark Loud, hopping up&#xD;
from his seat. "Lyman Randall paid it to me&#xD;
for the horse, and I put it into the drawer wkh&#xD;
some of the others, and if you'11 look on the&#xD;
book, you'll find that I gave him credit for it."&#xD;
1 "I remember now that I noticed the credit,"&#xD;
said Mr. Willey; "but there was only the same&#xD;
number of silver dollars that I put in there my-&#xD;
self, for I counted them."&#xD;
"Because I gave one of them to Sam Kendall&#xD;
in change for a two dollar bill," explained Mark,&#xD;
"and that was before I took the dollar of&#xD;
Lyman.."'&#xD;
And how do you know that it was the&#xD;
crossed dollar you took of my son ?" asked Mr.&#xD;
Randall.&#xD;
Because I took particular notice of it," re-&#xD;
turned Loud.    You see when the Portland&#xD;
stage got in, and after the horses were put up,&#xD;
the driver wanted to 'odd and even' with me to&#xD;
see who should carry the mail up to the post&#xD;
office; so I took out this dollar-for I hadn't&#xD;
had a chance to carry it into the office,-and I&#xD;
agreed to let him guess on the date of that, and&#xD;
when I come to look at the figures, I found a lit-&#xD;
tle cross that looked as though-it had been cut&#xD;
in with a knife, and one end of it came right&#xD;
down to the date. If that's the dollar that Ran-&#xD;
dall's got, you'll.find it just as I've said."&#xD;
. This produced quite a marked sensation ; and&#xD;
when Mr. Randall was asked to show the dol-&#xD;
lar, he freely acknowledged, though with accu-&#xD;
imulated wrath, that there was no need of it.&#xD;
"Then, of course, you withdraw your com-&#xD;
plaint," said Bullard.&#xD;
" Yes," returned Randall; and then turning&#xD;
&#xD;
ED DOLLAR.                               89&#xD;
savagely upon his son, he hissed out from be-&#xD;
tween his clenched teeth: "Lyman, you scamp,&#xD;
you shall suffer for this. Come, sir, and I'll&#xD;
teach-"&#xD;
But the boy did not choose to hear any more,&#xD;
for quickly turning at bay, he retorted:'&#xD;
"Now look here, father, you'd better keep&#xD;
dark, for I think I can tell some things as well as&#xD;
you !"&#xD;
Elias Randall was fumbled in a moment, and&#xD;
like a whipped cur, he turned to leave the office;&#xD;
but before lie did so, he herd farmer Jones&#xD;
remark:&#xD;
" Like father like son. The boy's learned his&#xD;
lesson well!"-&#xD;
There were tears in Wilton Cunningham's&#xD;
eyes when he took Alice by the hand, but he&#xD;
could not speak; nor could she, for her excite-&#xD;
ment had been too great; but of on  thing I am&#xD;
sure: in less than two short months, they had&#xD;
spoken to some purpose, for they had become&#xD;
one for life, and on the next Monday afterwards,&#xD;
Wilton opened a large store with a freely-loaned&#xD;
capital of eight thousand dollars.&#xD;
Just seven years have passed away since then.&#xD;
Mr. Randall lost all his customers in less than a&#xD;
year after the opening of the new store, for,&#xD;
through Cunningham's honest trading, the peo-&#xD;
ple found how shamefully they had been cheat-&#xD;
ed, and the latter has not only cleared enough to&#xD;
refund his borrowed capital, but he has gained a&#xD;
large circle of true-hearted friends, such as true&#xD;
honest worth never fails to win. Lymain Ran-&#xD;
dall was just in time to take the first 'Oregon&#xD;
fever;" while his father went to Canada, and en-&#xD;
tered into horse-trading, but no one ever bought&#xD;
a horse of him the second time, and he has sure-&#xD;
ly lived to lappieciate the old adage : "He who&#xD;
swims in small sins, will sink in greater sorrows."&#xD;

[PROM GLEASON'S PICTORIAL DRAWING-ROOM COMPANION.]&#xD;
THE HUMBLED PHARISEE.&#xD;
BY T. S. ARTHUR.&#xD;
"WHAT was that ?" exclaimed Mrs. Andrews, ' "Why not remain? What is an outrage,&#xD;
&#xD;
to the lady who was seated next to her, as a sin-&#xD;
gle strairi of music vibrated for a few moments&#xD;
on the atmosphere..&#xD;
"A violin, I suppose," was answered.&#xD;
"A violin 1"  An expression almost of horror&#xD;
came into the countenance of Mrs. Andrews.&#xD;
"It ein't be possible."&#xD;
It was possible, however, for the sound came&#xD;
again, prolonged and varied.&#xD;
" What does it mean?" asked Mrs. Andrews,&#xD;
looking troubled, and moving. uneasily in her&#xD;
'chair.&#xD;
" Cotillons, I presume," was answered, care-&#xD;
lessly.      .&#xD;
"Not dancing, surely I"&#xD;
But, even as Mrs. Andrews said this, a man&#xD;
entered, carrying in his hand a violin. There&#xD;
was an instant movement en the part of several&#xD;
younger members of the company; partners&#xD;
were chosen, and ere thew pious Mrs. Andrews&#xD;
had time to collect her suddenl y bewildered&#xD;
thoughts, the music had struck up, and the&#xD;
dancers were in motion.&#xD;
" I can't remain here.  It's an outrage 1"&#xD;
said Mrs. Andrews, making a motion to rise.&#xD;
The lady by whom she was sitting compre-&#xD;
hended now more clearly her state of mind, and]&#xD;
laying a hand on her atm, gently restrained her.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. Andrews ?" she asked.&#xD;
" Mrs. Burdick knew very well that I was a&#xD;
member of the church." The lady's manner&#xD;
was indignant.C&#xD;
"All your friends know that, Mrs. Andrews,"&#xD;
replied the lady. A third person might have de-&#xD;
tected in her tones a lurking sarcarm.~ But this&#xD;
was not perceived by the individual addressed.&#xD;
"But what is wrong?"'1&#xD;
- " Wrong!   Isn't that - wrong ?"  And she&#xD;
glanced towards the mazy wreath of human&#xD;
figures already circling on the floor. "I could&#xD;
not have believed it of Mrs. Burdick; and she&#xD;
knew that I was a-professor of religion."&#xD;
"She doesn't expect you to dance, Mrs. An-&#xD;
drews," said the lady.&#xD;
"But she expects me to countenance the sin&#xD;
and folly by my presence."&#xD;
"Sin and folly are strong terms, Mrs. An-&#xD;
drews."&#xD;
" I know they are, and I use them advisedly.&#xD;
I hold it a sin to dance." .-&#xD;
"I know wise and good people -who hold a&#xD;
different opinion."&#xD;
"Wise and good I"    Mrs. Andrews spQke&#xD;
with strong disgust. "I wouldn't give much&#xD;
for their wisdom and goodness-not I 1"&#xD;
" The true qualities of men and women are&#xD;

they generally change; their attire-mental as&#xD;
well as bodily. Now, I have seen the home-life&#xD;
of certain ladies, who do not think it sin to&#xD;
dance, and it was full of the heart's warm sun-&#xD;
shine; and I have seen the home-life of certain&#xD;
ladies who held dancing to be sinful, and I have&#xD;
said to myself, half shudderingly: 'What child&#xD;
can breathe that atmosphere for years, and not&#xD;
grow up with a clouded spirit, and a fountain of&#xD;
bitterness in the heart!"'&#xD;
" And so you mean to say," Mrs. Andrews&#xD;
spoke with some asperity of manner, "that danc-&#xD;
ing makes people better ?-Is, in fact, a means of&#xD;
grace ?"&#xD;
"No. I say no suoh thing."&#xD;
Then what do you mean to say? I draw&#xD;
the only conclusion I can make."&#xD;
" One may grow better or worse from danc-&#xD;
ing," said the lady. "All will depen l on the&#xD;
spirit in which the recreation is indulged. In it-&#xD;
self the get is innocent."&#xD;
Mrs. Andrews shook her head.&#xD;
"In what does its sin consist ?"&#xD;
"It is an idle waste of time."&#xD;
"Can you say nothing more of it ?"&#xD;
"I could, but delicacy keeps me silent."&#xD;
"Did you ever dance ?"&#xD;
"Me ? What a question! No 1"&#xD;
"I have danced often. And, let me say, that&#xD;
your inference on the score of indelicacy is al-&#xD;
together an assumption."&#xD;
"Why everybody admits that."&#xD;
"Not by any means."&#xD;
"If'the descriptions of some of the midnight&#xD;
balls and assemblies that I have heard, of the&#xD;
waltzing, and all that, be true, then nothing&#xD;
could be more indelicate,-nothing more injuri-&#xD;
ous to the'-young and innocent.'&#xD;
" All good things become evil in their per-&#xD;
verseness," said the lady. "' And I will readily&#xD;
agree with you, that dancing is perverted, and&#xD;
its use, as a means of social recreation, most&#xD;
sadly changed into what is injurious. The same&#xD;
may be said of church going."&#xD;
",You shock me," said Mrs. Andrews. "Ex-&#xD;
cuse me, but you are profaine."&#xD;
I "I trust not. For true religion-for the holy,&#xD;
things of the church-I trust that I have the&#xD;
most profound reverence. . But let me prove&#xD;
what I say, that even church going may become&#xD;
evil."&#xD;
"I am all attention,'" said the incredulous&#xD;
Mrs. Andrews.&#xD;
&#xD;

"You can bear plain speaking."&#xD;
"Me!" The church member looked sur-&#xD;
prised.&#xD;
"Yes, you."&#xD;
Certainly I can. But why do you ask ?"&#xD;
"To put you on your guard,-nothing more."&#xD;
"Don't fear but what I can bear all the plain&#xD;
speaking you may venture upon. As to church&#xD;
going being evil, I am ready to prove the nega-&#xD;
tive against any allegations you can advance..&#xD;
So speak on."&#xD;
After a slight pause, to collect her thoughts"&#xD;
the lady said:&#xD;
"There has been a protracted meeting in Mr.&#xD;
B-'s church."&#xD;
"9I know. And a blessed time it was."&#xD;
"You attended ?"&#xD;
"Yes, every day; and greatly was my soul&#xD;
refreshed and strengthened."&#xD;
"Did you see Mrs. Eldridge there ?"&#xD;
"Mrs. Eldridge? No indeed, except on Sun-&#xD;
day. She's too worldly-minded for that."&#xD;
" She has a pew in your church." .&#xD;
" Yes; and comes every Sunday morning be-&#xD;
cause it is fashionable and respectable to go to&#xD;
church.  As for her religion, it isn't worth&#xD;
much, and will hardly stand fire at the last&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"Why Mrs. Andrews!     You shock me!&#xD;
Have you seen into her heart? Do you know&#xD;
her purposes ? Judge not, that ye be not judged,&#xD;
is the divine injunction."&#xD;
" A  tree is known by- its fruit," said Mrs.&#xD;
Andrews, who felt the rebuke, aind slightly&#xD;
colored.&#xD;
"True; and by their fruits shall ye know&#xD;
them," replied the lady. "But come, there are&#xD;
too many around us here for this earnest conver-&#xD;
sation. We will take a quarter of an hour to&#xD;
ourselves in one of the less crowded rooms. No&#xD;
eone will observe our absence, and you will -be&#xD;
freed from the annoyance of these dances.?&#xD;
The two ladies quietly retired frorn the draw-&#xD;
ing-rooms. As soon as they were more alone,&#xD;
the last speaker resumed.&#xD;
"By their fruits ye shall know them.' Do&#xD;
men gather'grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?&#xD;
Let me relate what I saw and heard in the faini-&#xD;
ly of two ladies during this protracted meeting.&#xD;
One of these ladies was Mrs. Eldridge. Iwas&#xD;
passing in her neighborhood about four o'clock,&#xD;
and as I owed her a call, thought the opportuni-&#xD;
ty a good onie for returning it. On entering, my&#xD;
ears caught the blended music of a piano, and&#xD;

&#xD;
children's happy-voices. From the front parlor,I&#xD;
through the partly opened door, a sight, beauti-&#xD;
ful to my eyes, was revealed. Mrs. Eldridge was&#xD;
seated a~the instrument, her sweet babe asleep,&#xD;
on one arm, while, with a single hand, she was&#xD;
touching the notes of a familiar air, to which&#xD;
four children were dancing. A more innocent,&#xD;
loving, happy group I have never seen. For'&#xD;
nearly ten niinutes I , gazed upon them unob-&#xD;
served, so interested that I forgot the question-&#xD;
able propriety of my conduct, and during that&#xD;
time, not an unkind word was uttered by one of&#xD;
the children, nor did anything occur to mar the&#xD;
harmony of the scene. It was a sight on which&#xD;
angels could have looked, nay, did look with&#xD;
pleasure; for, whenever hearts are turned to&#xD;
good affections, angels are present.. The music&#xD;
was suspended, and the dancing ceased, as I pre-&#xD;
sented myself. The mother greeted me with a&#xD;
happy smile, and each of the children spoke to her&#xD;
visitor with an air at once polite and respectful.&#xD;
"'I've turned nurse for the afternoon, you&#xD;
see,' said Yrs. Eldridge, cheerfully. 'It's Alice's&#xD;
day to go out, and I never like to trust our little&#xD;
ones with the chambermaid, who is n't over fond'&#xD;
of children. We generally have a good time on&#xD;
these occasions, for I give myself up to them en-&#xD;
tirely. They've read, and played, and told sto-&#xD;
ries, until tired,-and now I've just brightened&#xD;
them up, body and mind, with a dance.' .&#xD;
"1And bright and happy they all looked.&#xD;
"'Now run up into the nursery for a little&#xD;
while, and build block. houses,' said she, 'while&#xD;
I have a little pleasant talk with my friend.&#xD;
That's good children. And I want you to be&#xD;
very quiet, for dear little Eddy is fast asleep, and&#xD;
I'm going to lay him in his crib.'&#xD;
"Away went the children, and I heard no more&#xD;
of them for the half hour during whi6h I staid.&#xD;
With the child in her ,arms, Mrs. Eldridge went'&#xD;
up to her chamber, and I went with her. As&#xD;
she was laying him in the crib, I took from the&#xD;
mantle a small porcelain figure of a -kneeling&#xD;
child, and was examining-it, when she turned to&#xD;
me. 'Very beautiful,' said I. 'It is,' she re-&#xD;
plied. 'We call it our Eddy, saying his prayers.&#xD;
There is a history attached to it. Very early I&#xD;
teach my little ones to say an evening prayer.&#xD;
First impressions are *ever wholly effaced; I,&#xD;
therefore seek to implant, in the very dawning&#xD;
of thought, an idea of ,God, ad our dependence&#xD;
on him for life and all our blessings, knowing&#xD;
that, if duly fixed, this idea will ever remain,&#xD;
and be the vessel, in after years, for the recep-&#xD;
&#xD;
tion of truth flowing down from the great&#xD;
source of all truth. -Strangely enough, my little&#xD;
Eddy,. so sweet in temper as he was, steadily re-&#xD;
fused to say his prayers. I tried in every way&#xD;
that I could think of to induce him to kn.eel&#xD;
with the other children, and repeat a few simple&#xD;
words ; but no, his aversion thereto was uncon-&#xD;
querable. I at last grew really troubled about&#xD;
it. There seemed to be a vein in his character&#xD;
that argued no good. One day I saw this kneel-&#xD;
ing child in a store. With the'sight of it came&#xD;
the thought of how I might use it. I bought&#xD;
the figure, and did not show it to Eddy until he&#xD;
was about going to bed. The effect was all I&#xD;
had hoped to produce. He looked at it for some&#xD;
moments earnestly, then' dropped on his little&#xD;
knees, clasped his white hands, and murmured&#xD;
the prayer I had so long and so vainly strove to&#xD;
make him repeat.'&#xD;
b- " Tears were in the eyes of Mrs. Eldridge, as&#xD;
she uttered the closing words. I felt that she&#xD;
was a true mother, and loved her children with&#xD;
a high and holy love. And now, let me give'&#xD;
you a picture that strongly contrasts with this.&#xD;
Not far from Mrs. Eldridge, resides a lady, who&#xD;
is remarkable for her devotion to the church,&#xD;
and, I am compelled to say, want of charity to-&#xD;
wards all who happen to differ with her-more&#xD;
particularly, if the difference involves church&#xD;
matters. It was after sundown; still being in&#xD;
the neighborhood, I embr ced the opportunity&#xD;
to make a call. On ringing the bell, I heard,&#xD;
immediately, a clatter ,of feet down the stairs&#xD;
and along the passage, accompanied by chil-&#xD;
dren's voices, loud and boisterous. It was some'&#xD;
time before the door was opened, for each of the&#xD;
four children, wishing to perform the office, each&#xD;
resisted the others' attempts to admit the visitor.&#xD;
Angry exclamations, rude outcries, ill names,&#xD;
and struggles for the advantage continued, until&#xD;
the cook, attracted from  the kitchen by the&#xD;
noise, arrived at the scene of contention, and,&#xD;
after jerking the children so roughly as to set&#xD;
the two youngest crying, swung it open, and I&#xD;
entered. On gaining the parlor, I asked for the&#xD;
mother of these .children.&#xD;
"'She is n't at home 1' said the cook.&#xD;
"'She's gone to church,' said the oldest of&#xD;
the children.&#xD;
S"Iwish she'd stayat home,' remarked cook&#xD;
in a very disrespectful way, and with a manner&#xD;
that showed her to be much fretted in her mind.&#xD;
'It's Mary's day out, and she knows I can't do&#xD;
anything with' the children. Such children I&#xD;
&#xD;
never saw! They don't mind a word you -say,&#xD;
and quarrel so among themselves, that it makes&#xD;
me sick to hear them.'&#xD;
"At this moment a headless doll struck&#xD;
against the side of my neck. It had been thrown&#xD;
by one child at another; missing her aim, she&#xD;
gave me the benefit of her evil intention. At&#xD;
this, cook lost all patience, and seizing the of-&#xD;
'fending little one, boxed her soundly, before I&#xD;
could interfere. The language\ used by that&#xD;
child, as she escaped from the cook's hands, was&#xD;
shocking. It made my flesh creep !&#xD;
"'Did I understand you to say that your&#xD;
mother had gone to church?' I asked of the&#xD;
oldest child.&#xD;
"'(Yes, ma'am,' was answered. 'She 's been&#xD;
every day this week.  There 's a protracted&#xD;
meeting.'&#xD;
"'Give me that book!' screamed a child, at&#xD;
this moment. Glancing across the room, I saw&#xD;
two of the little ones contending for possession&#xD;
of a'large family Bible, which lay upon a small&#xD;
table. Before I could reach them, for I started&#xD;
forward, from ,an impulse of the moment, the&#xD;
table was thrown over, the marble top broken,&#xD;
and the cover torn from the sacred volume."&#xD;
The face of Mrs. Andrews became instantly&#xD;
of a deep crimson. Not seeming to notice this,&#xD;
her friend continued.&#xD;
"As'the table fell, it came within an inch of&#xD;
striking another child on the bead, who had seat-&#xD;
ed himself on the floor. Had it done so, a frac-&#xD;
tured skull, perhaps instant death, would have&#xD;
been the consequence."&#xD;
Mrs.*Andrews caught her breath, and grew&#xD;
very palp. The other continued.&#xD;
"In the midst of the confusion that followed,'&#xD;
the father came nome.1&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Where is your mother?' he asked of one of&#xD;
th'e children.&#xD;
"'Gone to church,' was replied.&#xD;
"'0 dear!' I'can hear his voice now, with it,&#xD;
tone of hopelessness,-' This church-going ma-&#xD;
nia is dreadful. I tell my wife that it is all wrong.&#xD;
That her best service to God is to bring up her&#xD;
children in the love of what is good and true,-&#xD;
in filial obedience and' fraternal affection. But&#xD;
it avails not.'&#xD;
"And now, Mrs. Andrews," continued the&#xD;
lady, not in the least appearing to notice the&#xD;
distress and confusion of'her over-pious friend,&#xD;
whom she had placed upon the rack, " When&#xD;
God comes to make up his jewels, and says t&amp;amp;&#xD;
Mrs. Eldridge, and also to this mother whW&#xD;
thought nore of church-going 'than of her pre-&#xD;
cious little ones, Where are the children I gave&#xD;
.you? which do you thibk will be most likely to&#xD;
say, Here they are, not one is lost ?"&#xD;
"Have I not clearly shown you that even&#xD;
church-going- may be perverted into an evil?&#xD;
That piety may attain an inordinate growth,&#xD;
while charity is, dead at the root? Spiritual&#xD;
pride; a vain conceit of superior goodness, be-&#xD;
cause of the observance oF certain forms and cere-&#xD;
monies, is the error into which too many devout&#xD;
religionists fall. But God sees not as man&#xD;
seeth. He looks into the heart, and judges his&#xD;
creatures by the motives thpt rule them."&#xD;
And, as she said this, she arose, the silent&#xD;
and rebuked Mrs. Andrews, whose own picture&#xD;
had been drawn, following her down to the gay&#xD;
drawing rooms.&#xD;
Many a purer heart than that of the humbled&#xD;
Pharisee, beat there beneath the bosoms of hap.&#xD;
py maidens, even though thcir feet were rising&#xD;
and falling in time to witching melodies.&#xD;

THE WALBEIDGE FAMILY.,&#xD;
A THANKSGIVING STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
BY MRS. CAROLINE ORNE.&#xD;
THE last Thursday in J1ovember had beeiR farm-houses, constituted a delightful premonition&#xD;
set apart by the governor of Massachusetts, for -to the juveniles, in an especial manner-of the&#xD;
the celebration of Thanksgiving. The long In- nature of the feast which mightsbe expected in&#xD;

and bowls of delicious cream, and above all, the would have accepted a freeholder for a husband,&#xD;
large, golden-rind pumpkins, displayed on the who was obliged to toil early and late, o'r the&#xD;
dressers and tables of the ample kitchens of the son of a farmer, who had. nothing -in his own&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
right, if he remained at home and worked on&#xD;
his father's farm, a young man who was obliged&#xD;
to hire out by the month or year would have&#xD;
been considered, as filling an inferior station in&#xD;
society, aid, consequently, beneath what they&#xD;
had a right to expect in forming a matrimonial&#xD;
alliance.&#xD;
Mark Thornton was what, in common par-&#xD;
lance, was termed Esquire Walbridge's "hired&#xD;
man."   He would, therefore-though one of the&#xD;
best educated, the most intelligent and finest&#xD;
looking young men in the place-have been&#xD;
thought arrogant and presuming, had it been&#xD;
suspected that he aspired to the hand of one of&#xD;
his employer's daughters. Yet it was a-iepe of&#xD;
arrogance which he did venture to indulge in his&#xD;
secret hart; and, though he loved silently, the&#xD;
fair object .of his devotion knew it full well.&#xD;
There were four daughters-Jgie, Rebecca, Ann&#xD;
and -Ella--the last being still a child. Rebecca,&#xD;
the second daughter, was the one who had&#xD;
awakened the admiration of Mark ,Thornton.&#xD;
At first, he being 'onlylthe "hired man," she&#xD;
looked on him with some disdain; but his hand-&#xD;
some face, superior intelligence, and manly, in-&#xD;
dependent demeanor, were not without their in-&#xD;
fluence, and she soon, without being exactly con-&#xD;
scious of it, began to reciprocate the sentiments&#xD;
with which he regarded her. Not a single mem-&#xD;
ber of the family suspected anything of the kind.-&#xD;
Had Esquire Walbridge himself done so, he&#xD;
would not have hired him a single day after the&#xD;
expiration of the time for which he had engaged&#xD;
him. Mark, for the.present, had no mind that&#xD;
he should know it. He preferred having the&#xD;
privilege of living under the same roof with the&#xD;
beautiful Rebecca, and was willing to " bide his&#xD;
time;" for he felt that the season was not far dis.&#xD;
tant, when he would ask for her hand without&#xD;
danger of being repulsed.&#xD;
" Let me see," said Mrs. Walbridge, as she&#xD;
stood at a table paing the rind from the long,&#xD;
curved slices of pumpkin, which Rebecca was&#xD;
cutting from an uncommonly-fine specimen of&#xD;
the indispensable edible, "let me see how many&#xD;
we' shall have to dinner Thanksgiving day.&#xD;
There will be John and his wife and three chit-&#xD;
dren, paniel and his wife and their little Jenny,&#xD;
your Aunt, Hannah West and Uncle Daniel&#xD;
Walbridge. Then, if the day is pleasant, grand-&#xD;
father and grandmother Walbridge will come."&#xD;
"Which will make twelve," said Rebeeca.'&#xD;
"And then, you know, we -always ask the&#xD;
Widog Page and her daughter."&#xD;
&#xD;
"And it will be no more than common polite-&#xD;
ness toinvite the schoolmaster," said Jane.&#xD;
" It will be well enough to invite him, as he is&#xD;
a stranger in the place," said Mrs. Walbridge.&#xD;
"What is his name ?"&#xD;
"Bateman," replied Jane.&#xD;
"I should n't wonder," said her mother, "if&#xD;
he was a son of old Major Bateman. I was well&#xD;
acquainted with the major when I was a girl. He&#xD;
was as smart and enterprising a young man, as&#xD;
one you'll see in a thousand. His father gave&#xD;
him a lot of wild land, when he was twenty-one,&#xD;
and he went right to work and cleared a dozen&#xD;
acres of it-half of which he sowed to rye, and&#xD;
planted the other half to corn. In the fall, he&#xD;
took five hundred dollars in cash for what be&#xD;
raised, which gave him a fine start in the world,&#xD;
and encouraged him to go on as he had begun.&#xD;
New, you see, if he had done as Mark Thornton&#xD;
has, hired out by the month or year, it would&#xD;
have taken him a long time to earn what he did&#xD;
in a single year."&#xD;
'" You know that Mark had no rich father to&#xD;
give him a lot of land," said Rebeeca.&#xD;
"That is tme; but I don't believe if he had,&#xD;
that he would have been enterprising enough to&#xD;
have cleared it. Mark is a civil, industrious&#xD;
young man, but he has not got enterprise enough&#xD;
to suit me. I'll tell you, gils, what I have been&#xD;
thinking of."&#xD;
" What is it, mother ?" said Ann.&#xD;
"I've been thinking that Mark Thornton and&#xD;
Polly Shores, Mrs.'Dresser's hired girl, would&#xD;
make a good match."&#xD;
"Why, mother,"said Rebecca, "Polly Shores&#xD;
is at least five years older than Mark, andis just&#xD;
as plain as she can be. Besides, her education&#xD;
is very poor; she can read and write, and that&#xD;
is all."&#xD;
" Well, she is a good working girl, as ever&#xD;
was, and according to my mind, would- make,&#xD;
Mark a first-rate wife."&#xD;
" Why, Mark has as good an education as any&#xD;
young man in the place," said Rebecca, "and is&#xD;
better qualified to teach the school than Mr.&#xD;
Bateman. Brother John.who is one of the ex-&#xD;
amining committee, says he is."  a&#xD;
" You had better mind, Rebecca," said Ann,&#xD;
"or we shall begin to think you have taken a&#xD;
fancy to Mark."&#xD;
"Well, you needn't think so," said Rebecca,&#xD;
bending a little lower over the pumpkin she was&#xD;
cutting to conceal her heightened color.&#xD;
"Come, I guess we shan't reckon up how&#xD;

many we are going to have to dine.Thanksgivitig&#xD;
day, at this rate," said Jane.&#xD;
"I guess so, too," said Mrs. Walbridge.&#xD;
" We had got up to fifteen," said Ann, "in-&#xD;
cluding the Widow Page and her daughter, and&#xD;
the schoolmaster."            I&#xD;
" Which, with our own family, will make&#xD;
twenty-three," said Mrs. Walbridge.  "And&#xD;
then we some expect your Uncle David and his&#xD;
family from Newburyport, which will make the&#xD;
number up to thirty. Well, if there should be&#xD;
fifty, we shall have enough and to spare. Here&#xD;
comes Mark, with another pumpkin. I am glad&#xD;
he has brought it, for the kettles will hold an-,&#xD;
other just as well as not."&#xD;
"I've just seen Sydney Philips," said Mark,&#xD;
as he placed the pumpkin on the table. "Here,&#xD;
Rebecca, let me cut it in half' for you--I'm&#xD;
strongerdn the hand thlan you are."&#xD;
".Ann, did you hear what Mark said about&#xD;
Sydney Philips ?" said Jane.&#xD;
"iI rather think she did, by her blushing so,"'&#xD;
remarked Rebecca.&#xD;
"I thought he was teaching school somewhere&#xD;
this vacation," said Mrs. Walbridge.&#xD;
"So he is," replied Mark, "but he thought he&#xD;
would spend Thanksgiving week at home."'&#xD;
"iSydney is almost through college, is n't he,&#xD;
Mark ?' inquired Mrs. Walbridge.&#xD;
"1He has only one more year to stay, and he&#xD;
then intends coming home and studying divinity&#xD;
with his father."&#xD;
"1So I may have a minister for .a brother-in-,&#xD;
law," said Jane.&#xD;
"And I may have a-merchant for one," said&#xD;
Ann.&#xD;
It was now Jane's turn to blush, there having&#xD;
been some "love passages " between.her and a&#xD;
young merchant of Boston, by the name of&#xD;
Danbury.&#xD;
"Don't you want some oven-wood ?" asked&#xD;
Mark, having finished cutting the pumpkiri.&#xD;
"No, not to-day," said Mrs. Walbridge. "All&#xD;
we calculate on doing to-day is to stew.and sift&#xD;
the pumpkin, prepare the minced meat for the&#xD;
pies, ,and such kind of chores.  To-morrow&#xD;
morning, we shall, begin to bake, bright and&#xD;
early."&#xD;
"And wont you bake me a pie-crust bird ?"&#xD;
said little Ella, who, with her brother Charley,&#xD;
had just come in from the barn, where they had&#xD;
been hunting hens' nest.&#xD;
"cAnd me a pie-crust horse ?" said.Charley.&#xD;
" I declare, I am afraid Charley, if he lives,&#xD;

&#xD;
will be a horse-jocky," said Mrs. Walbridge'&#xD;
"His mind is always running upon horses."&#xD;
" So was mine, when I was of his age," said&#xD;
Esquire Walbridge, who, at this moment, entered&#xD;
the kitchen. " And to confess the truth, I've al-&#xD;
ways had a liking for a good horse. I talk of&#xD;
riding over to Smith's Corner, mother. Don't&#xD;
you want to send for some little knick-knacks&#xD;
for Thanksgiving ?"&#xD;
"Well, I don't know-we are pretty well pro-&#xD;
vided for, I believe, but you may get a few nut-&#xD;
megs and cloves, if you have a mind to."&#xD;
-" We ought to havea dozen pounds of nice&#xD;
raisins," said Jane. "Those we have in the&#xD;
house aint first rate."&#xD;
"Is th it all?" said the 'Squire. "Why, I&#xD;
expected you would want a whole wagon load&#xD;
of one'thing and another."&#xD;
"La, we can't eat everything," said Mrs.&#xD;
Walbridge. "4fr store room/ is full of flour,&#xD;
rice, sugar, coffee and' tea, to say nothing of&#xD;
such articles as are i-aised on the farm."&#xD;
"I aRi glad we are so well provided for," said&#xD;
he, " and it reminds me of those who are not so&#xD;
well off. Hadn't I better take along some arti-&#xD;
cles in my wagon, to help a few poor families to&#xD;
keep Thanksgiving.?"&#xD;
" Yes, you had certainly. I ain 'glad you&#xD;
thought of it. Wait a few minutes, and I will&#xD;
put up a lot of flour and sugar and other neces-&#xD;
saries for Mr..Green's family and a few others.&#xD;
He has been sick all the fall, and finds 'it hard&#xD;
getting along."&#xD;
"If I see anybody while I am gone that I take&#xD;
a fancy to invite to dine with us Thanksgiving&#xD;
day, I shall," said he, taking up a basket she&#xD;
had been packing in one hand, and a pretty&#xD;
large bag of flour in the other.&#xD;
"Do, do," said 'his wife, "for the girls and I&#xD;
have been reckoning up how many we expect,&#xD;
and if they all come, there will only be thirty,&#xD;
including our own family."&#xD;
"That aint enough for people that have as&#xD;
much house room as we have., I'll try and hunt&#xD;
up a few more," said the 'Squire.&#xD;
"Perhaps," said 1Irs. Walbridge, "Sydney&#xD;
Philips would come, if you invited him. He is&#xD;
at home, Mark says.'      -&#xD;
"No,no, it wont do to break in upon a family&#xD;
circle in that way. If we invite Sydney, we&#xD;
must invite Mr. Philips and his wife too." '&#xD;
"Well, father, supposing we shodd invite&#xD;
them," said Mrs. Walbridge. " I think they&#xD;
would like to come, and I am sure that we,&#xD;
should all be glad to have them."&#xD;
&#xD;
IN'S "I&#xD;
&#xD;
"There was a young gentleman came home&#xD;
with Sydney," said Charley. "I was down by&#xD;
Mr. Philips's, and saw them both when they got&#xD;
out of the stage."&#xD;
"How did he look ?" Inquired Ann.&#xD;
"0, he was dressed up as grand as could be."&#xD;
"Did he look as well as Sydney ?" asked&#xD;
Rebecca..*&#xD;
"Yes, I guess he did. His eyes were as black&#xD;
and bright us 6ur Mark's."&#xD;
"Well," said Esquire Walbridge, "if they&#xD;
have a visitor, he must be included in the invi-&#xD;
tation."t&#xD;
"To be sure he must," was the reply of his&#xD;
Wife.&#xD;
"It begins to snow-it begins to snow !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Charley, as he came into the back door,&#xD;
with a basket of chips in his hand, Wednesday&#xD;
morning; and he fairly danced for joy-an exer-&#xD;
cise in which little Lila joined with a hearty&#xD;
good will.&#xD;
A few large flakes of snow had, indeed, begun&#xD;
to fall, which gradually growing smaller and'&#xD;
thicker, promised to fulfil the prophecy of those&#xD;
who had foretold a snow-storm. A short snow-&#xD;
storm would be most welcome; but should it&#xD;
prove to be a long one-ah, there was the rub!&#xD;
The snow continned to fall: during the day,&#xD;
and many a pair of hl.git eyes looked forth into&#xD;
the murky   r tie last thing before retiring for&#xD;
the night; while Charley Walbridge went to bed&#xD;
'witti a full determination to rise every half hour,&#xD;
to watch the progress of the storm, having sol-&#xD;
emnly promised 'ilila-the ddor of her bed-room&#xD;
being left ajar for the purpose-that he would,&#xD;
each time, infora her of the result of his obser-&#xD;
vations. Unfortunately, he had but one nap,&#xD;
and that lasted till after sunrise the following&#xD;
morning.&#xD;
" The storm is over, Ella," said he, having&#xD;
dressed himself in great haste.&#xD;
"Over so soon ?" said she, rubbing her eyes.&#xD;
"Why, it isn't half an hour yet, since we went&#xD;
to bed-is it?"&#xD;
" Only think of the sound, sleep of childhood,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Walbridg", who had overheard what&#xD;
was said by the ebildren.&#xD;
"Yes," replied her husband, "but labor will&#xD;
produce sound sleep, too, as I have proved dur-&#xD;
ing a life of fifty years. Well, girls," said he,&#xD;
to his three eldest daughters, who now made&#xD;
'their 'appearance, " the double sleigh and span&#xD;
of grays Will have ,to be brought into service to-&#xD;
day. I guess there are six inches of good rolid&#xD;
snow, and as smooth as the house floor."&#xD;
&#xD;
The religious services were to commence at&#xD;
eleven, and it must be confessed that the girls&#xD;
felt no little pleasure in having so good an op-&#xD;
portunity to display their winter bonnets, and&#xD;
other such tasteful paraphernalia as had been&#xD;
prepared for the occasion. There was a fine&#xD;
show, of waving plumes and fluttering 'ribbons;&#xD;
and the faces that looked out from the tasteful&#xD;
bonnets were fresh and fair as June roses spark-&#xD;
ling with dew. Even Mrs. Walbridge did 'not&#xD;
form an exception. At -forty-five, bright'chest-&#xD;
nut hair, curled according to the approved&#xD;
fashion of earlier days, formed a rich shade&#xD;
round a countenance lit up by dark, beaming&#xD;
eyes, and bright with the roseate hues of health.&#xD;
Rebecca, however, was the most beautiful of&#xD;
them all. There was a charmingabandon in&#xD;
all her movements and attitudes, which, without&#xD;
the least consciousness on her part, gave to her&#xD;
appearance a grace and- elegance perfectly&#xD;
inimitable.&#xD;
When the double sleigh, drawn by the'spirited&#xD;
horses-which sported their long strings of silver-&#xD;
toned bells, as proudly as a lady would her dia-&#xD;
mond necklace-dashed up to the church door,&#xD;
Sydney Philips and a young man, who was a&#xD;
stranger, sbod in the porch. He was a fellow&#xD;
student, by name, Robert Vinton, and the same&#xD;
who had accompauiied him home.&#xD;
"By the red lip of Hebe, that is a fine-looking&#xD;
girl, Sydney," said he, as Rebecca Walbridge&#xD;
sprang lightly from the, sleigh.&#xD;
gYes, they are all three of them fine-looking&#xD;
girls," was Sydney's reply, as ie sought to&#xD;
catch the eye of Ann.&#xD;
Esquire Walbridge, who now entered the&#xD;
porch, shook hands very cordially with his&#xD;
young friend Sydney, who introduced Vinton to&#xD;
him. The 'squire took the opportunity to invite&#xD;
them to dine at his house, an invitation which&#xD;
was gladly accepted.&#xD;
Mark Thornton, who stood near, without be-&#xD;
ing able to assign a reason satisfactory to him-&#xD;
self, did not feel pleased with young Vinton's&#xD;
appearance. He was certainly what most people&#xD;
would call handsome; his eyes, in a particular&#xD;
manner, as little- Charley Walbridge had de-&#xD;
scribed them, were very bright-as bright as&#xD;
Mark's-but, at times) they shot forth a fiery,&#xD;
gleaming light, very different from the clear, lus-&#xD;
trous beams which gave life and animation to&#xD;
the bronzed countenance of Thornton.&#xD;

THE WALBRIDGE FAMILY.&#xD;
&#xD;
invitation to dine at the 'squire's, came at nine&#xD;
o'clock in the morning, so that neither Mrs.&#xD;
Walbridge nor one of her daughters would be&#xD;
obliged to stay from church to prepare dinner.&#xD;
When, therefore, the family returned, accompa-&#xD;
nied by their two married sons and their families,&#xD;
the pastor and his wife, together with Sydney&#xD;
and young Vinton, everything was ready to&#xD;
place upon the table., The parents of Esquire&#xD;
Walbridge, also Uncle David and his family&#xD;
from Newburyport, had already arrived, much&#xD;
to the delight of the Walbridges, -who were&#xD;
afraid they would not come.&#xD;
Dinner was soon announced, and while Mr.&#xD;
Philips, a gentleman with a mild- and benign&#xD;
countenance, said grace, each one present stood&#xD;
with reverent air and downcast eyes. The bless-&#xD;
ing was rather long-at least, so thought those&#xD;
whose appetites were peculiarly keen-but all&#xD;
agreed that" it was very good, and very appro-&#xD;
priate. It is true that, under different circum-&#xD;
stances,'it might have .passed for a prayer, and&#xD;
been thought rather long at that; but the good&#xD;
pastor, in the benevolence of his heart, could&#xD;
not think of passing over any one present with.&#xD;
out a kindly mention, and he was prompted by&#xD;
similar benevolent emotions to remember the&#xD;
poor and destitute of his own country, and the&#xD;
perishing heathen of distant lands.&#xD;
When ample'justice had been done to the feast&#xD;
of good things set beforethem, the younger por-&#xD;
tion ,of the company were sobn assembled round,&#xD;
a good fire in a large room by themselves, leav-&#xD;
ing their seniors in possession of the parloiRo&#xD;
discuss themes of grave and weighty import,&#xD;
among which politics bore a prominent part.&#xD;
Mark Thornton mingled with the young people&#xD;
on terms of perfect equality. Even Esquire&#xD;
Walbridge'and his wife did not consider it amiss&#xD;
for him to be admitted to the social circle of&#xD;
which their daughters formed a part, but for him&#xD;
to marry one of them was not to be thought of.&#xD;
Young Vinton began, at once, to be most as-&#xD;
siduous in his attentions to the beautiful Rebecca.&#xD;
Judging from the manner with' which she re-&#xD;
ceived them, however, she did not imagine he&#xD;
was conferring on her any particular honor. In-&#xD;
stead of this, she evidently felt annoyed by them.&#xD;
Mark Thornton watched him closely, and, as it&#xD;
must be confessed, with a slight feeling of jeal.&#xD;
ousy. Not that he distrusted Rebecca, but be-&#xD;
cause he felt that Vinton was not worthy to be&#xD;
admitted to her companionship, even for an&#xD;
hour. Vinton, when he saw how closely he ob-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WALBRID&#xD;
&#xD;
served him, felt vexed and irritated, and in a&#xD;
voice loud enough to- be beard by all present,&#xD;
asked Sydney Philips who that clown was, who&#xD;
was admitted into the society of ladies and gen-&#xD;
tlemen. Sydney rgddeped with shame at the&#xD;
rudeness of one he had introduced as his friend,&#xD;
and replied in a low voice:&#xD;
s' We have no clowns in Westbrook," said he.&#xD;
"With us, a tiller of the s6i1 is accounted hon-&#xD;
orable."&#xD;
" Honorable or dishonorable," said Vinton,&#xD;
"I shall not associate on terms of equality with&#xD;
that fellow."&#xD;
Mark Thornton heard the remark, but would&#xD;
not disturb the company by appearing to notice&#xD;
it. Vinton found he had gone too far, and had&#xD;
he seen the look of ilisdain which RebeceaWal-&#xD;
bridge cast upon him, his vanity would not have-&#xD;
been greatly flattered.. But she, as well as the&#xD;
rest, seemed determined to forget Vinton's rude-&#xD;
ness. Everything, to appearance, went on pleas-&#xD;
antly, except that Vinton persisted in being ob-&#xD;
trusively attentive to Rebecca.&#xD;
After the company had gone, and Rebecca&#xD;
Walbridge had retired to her. own room, she&#xD;
missed a small, plain gold locket. It was one&#xD;
that Mark had- given her, and the only present&#xD;
he ever made her. As, at the same time, he&#xD;
presented some trifles to each of the sisters, the&#xD;
family did not consider it as a love-token. Nei-&#xD;
ther did she, at the time, think of it in that light;&#xD;
but latterly there had been cause for her to sus-&#xD;
pect that the, presents to her sisters had been&#xD;
made to prevent her from refusing the locket.&#xD;
Though, at the time, she would have thought&#xD;
him too presuming, since then, her appreciation&#xD;
of his character, and with it, her feelings with&#xD;
regard to him, in every respect, had uidergone a&#xD;
great change. This little ornament, then, though&#xD;
of iot much intrinsic value, was held in higher&#xD;
estimation than those handsomer and costlier,&#xD;
and when she found that it was gone, she went&#xD;
below to search for it. She found the piece of rib-&#xD;
bon to which it had been appended, but the locket&#xD;
was gone. She consoled herself with the hope&#xD;
that by daylight she should be more successful,&#xD;
It so happened that it was necessary for Mark&#xD;
Thornton to call at Mr. Philips's on the evening&#xD;
of the following day. He was receivedivery po-&#xD;
litely by Mr. and Mrs. Phtlips, also by Sydney;&#xD;
but Vinton, who was present, did not deign to&#xD;
recognize him.&#xD;
At the time Mark entered, the two young men&#xD;
were sitting somelittle distance from the, fire, at&#xD;
&#xD;
a table covered with books and papers. A chair&#xD;
had been placed for Mark, nearly opposite the&#xD;
table. All at once, his attention was attracted&#xD;
by something which Vinton was turning over in'&#xD;
his hands in rather a careless manner. The hot&#xD;
blood mounted to Mark's brow, for he instantly&#xD;
knew it to be the locket, which about a year pre-&#xD;
vious he gave to Rebecca Walbridge. He had,&#xD;
with sec-et pleasure, noticed that she wore it&#xD;
Thanksgiving day, and it was no wonder that, a&#xD;
quick pang of jealousy thrilled his bosom, at&#xD;
seeing it in the possession of Vinton.&#xD;
"What have you there, Vinton ?" said Syd-&#xD;
ney, whose eye chanced to rest on the locket.&#xD;
" Nothing but a little keepsake."&#xD;
" Given you by your sister, I suppose."&#xD;
Vinton shook his head and smiletl.&#xD;
"Whs, then ?"&#xD;
"By a young lady, and a very beautiful one,&#xD;
too.'&#xD;

)GE FAMILY.                             99&#xD;
and, as soon as he possibly could, he took leave.&#xD;
When he returned home, it was observed by the&#xD;
whole family that his spirits were much depress-&#xD;
ed, while towards Rebecca, his demeanor was&#xD;
singularly cold And distant. For this she/was&#xD;
totally at a loss, how to account. She had not&#xD;
mentioned the loss of the locket to any one,&#xD;
thinking she should yet come across it. Several&#xD;
days passed away, during which time Mark and&#xD;
Rebecca had scardely spoken to each other. At&#xD;
last, one evening he entered the kitchen where&#xD;
she was engaged in the performance of some-&#xD;
household duty, no other person being present.&#xD;
"Rebecca," said he, "I am glad to find you&#xD;
alone, for I have something I wish to say to you."&#xD;
"And I," said Rebecca, "have something I&#xD;
wish t'o say to you."&#xD;
"What is it '"&#xD;
"Tell me first what you have to say to me."&#xD;
"I wish to speak a few words about a locket I&#xD;
once gave you."&#xD;
" Which is precisely what I wish to speak to&#xD;
you about."&#xD;
"It was a trifle, I know-not worthy your ac-&#xD;
ceptance; yet I could not have believed you&#xD;
would give it to Vintoni"&#xD;
" Give it to Vinton!" she repeated. "Who&#xD;
says I gave it to him ?"&#xD;
" He himself says so."&#xD;
"Then he says what is false."&#xD;
"If you did not give it to him, how came he&#xD;
by it?"&#xD;
"Is it possible that he has it f'&#xD;
"It is-I saw him with it, and I heard him&#xD;
tell Sydney Philips that you gave It to him."&#xD;
" I lost it, and he, I suppose, must have found&#xD;
it; but why lie kept it, I cannot imagine."-&#xD;
"For the purpose, no. doubt, of using it in the&#xD;
way he has, in order to excite my jealousy, and&#xD;
I am sorry to say that lie succeeded. I might&#xD;
have known that you did not give it.to him."&#xD;
" Yes, I think you might. Now that all is ex-&#xD;
plained, I wish he would just return the locket."&#xD;
"I hope, after what has taken place, that you&#xD;
would not wear it, if he did."&#xD;
"No, but don't wish him to have it."&#xD;
" Hewon have it long."&#xD;
"I beg that you wont say anything to him&#xD;
about it."&#xD;
" I may, and I may not," was Mark's reply,&#xD;
he turned to leave the room.&#xD;
Thevery next day, Mafk and Vinton happen-&#xD;
- ed to meet. It was a retired place,'and no other&#xD;
,person was .in sight. Vinton was passing on&#xD;
&#xD;
"Is her name a secret i&#xD;
"By no means. Here it is, inscribed on the&#xD;
back of the locket."&#xD;
As he spoke, he handed the locket to Sydney,&#xD;
who, with a surprise he c'uld not conceal, read&#xD;
the name of Rebecca Walbridge.&#xD;
"Is this possible, and on so short an acquaint-&#xD;
ance "&#xD;
"I think that the locket will speak for itself,"&#xD;
said Vinton, casting a furtive glance towards&#xD;
Mark.&#xD;
"I could not have thought it," said Sydney.&#xD;
"I had some difficulty in persuading'Ann to ac-&#xD;
cept a trifling present, and I am sure that Re-&#xD;
becca 'has always appeared to be quite as much&#xD;
reserved in such matters as Ann."&#xD;
"Rebecca Walbridge is a splendid girl-that's&#xD;
a fact," said Vinton. -" I could not have be-&#xD;
lieved that Westbrook afforded one so beautiful,&#xD;
and I consider myself a lucky dog in coming&#xD;
scioss her."&#xD;
This conversation had been carried on ir-an&#xD;
under tone on the part of Sydney, for he did not&#xD;
wish either his parents or Mark Thornton to&#xD;
hear what was said. Vinton, on the contrary,&#xD;
had taken no pains to suppress his voice,'having&#xD;
eichibite .he locket for the express purpose of&#xD;
exciting'  ark's jealousy. Sydney, who-by no&#xD;
means felt please that a sister of Ann. should&#xD;
bestow on an acquaintance of a few hours, a&#xD;
trinket intended, as Vinton said, for a keepsake&#xD;
became grave and silent.&#xD;
It was with a strong effort thatMark Thorn.&#xD;
 to maintained an appearance of composure&#xD;
