THE FATAL SECIRET.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER         I.&#xD;
THE NUN' S FLIGHT.&#xD;
IT was a glorious night in May, of the year&#xD;
15-. The moon from an unclouded sky&#xD;
threw great masses of light on the rustling&#xD;
woods,the leafy hills,and the white gleaming&#xD;
walls of the convent of St. Ursula. The&#xD;
whisper of the trees and the distant splash&#xD;
of a babbling brook were the only sounds,&#xD;
that mingled   with, and enhanced  the&#xD;
dreamy silence, which covers earth, and&#xD;
air, and sky late at night. Very dark were&#xD;
the woods around the convent, and the pur-&#xD;
plish silver, which the moonlight poured on&#xD;
them, penetrated not farther than the leafy&#xD;
summits. A feeling of loneliness and awe&#xD;
that checks all admiration, they might else&#xD;
awaken, is created by these silentgrandeurs&#xD;
of night, and the bright cold moonshine&#xD;
strews a ghostly glitter over natures's face.&#xD;
The bells of the convent had poured their&#xD;
sounds into the dark chestnut woods, to an.&#xD;
nounce the hour of one, when a window in&#xD;
the rear of the convent opened,and the figure&#xD;
of a nun appeared, at the casement. The&#xD;
long black robes of the order closely envel-&#xD;
oped her form, but the large white veil, as&#xD;
well as the unshapely cap, were thrown&#xD;
back anddiselosed aface ofwonderfulbeauty.&#xD;
Features of exquisite loveliness, but on which&#xD;
dwelt tle cold and severe expression of mar.&#xD;
ble; Cyes of glorious and diamond-like ra-&#xD;
dianpe, with slight but intensely black&#xD;
brows; and hair of a glossy purplish-black&#xD;
hue, that hung in large and damp waves&#xD;
down her back, beneath the upper garments;&#xD;
all combined to give a haughty and cold, but&#xD;
gloriously beautiful appearance to thenun.&#xD;
She again closed the window, and pro.&#xD;
needed by the light of the moon, which&#xD;
&#xD;
poured a stream of radiance through every&#xD;
casement and oriflce, through long galleries&#xD;
and vaulted halls, past the small black doors&#xD;
of cells and the glittering images of saints&#xD;
and martyrs, now unlocking some door with&#xD;
extreme caution, then swinging back an&#xD;
iron grate that barred her way, until she ar-&#xD;
rived at the chamber close to the chapel. In&#xD;
this room, entered the nuns, as they were&#xD;
received into the convent after taking the&#xD;
veil, and laying aside the gorgeous garments&#xD;
in which they for the last time had been at-&#xD;
tired, assumed the sable costume of the sis-&#xD;
ters. The garments and jewels, they laid&#xD;
aside, were kept in a large closet, in the&#xD;
corner of the room, which, containing many&#xD;
valuable ornaments, was 'securely locked.-&#xD;
The nun, taking a key from the black bag&#xD;
hanging at her girdle, unlocked it, and be&#xD;
gan, by the light of the moon to examine the&#xD;
various garments that hung from the hooks.&#xD;
She selected a robeof white satin gorgeously&#xD;
embroidered with gold,and edged with white&#xD;
fur; an under dress of gold and silver bro-&#xD;
cade, and a chatalaine, or girdle of jewels,&#xD;
which,. after spanning the waist, almost&#xD;
reached the ground. A wreath of white ro-&#xD;
ses and a diamond necklace were taken from&#xD;
one of the drawers in the closet, and then the&#xD;
nun relocked the wardrobe.&#xD;
"My bridal costume," she murmured, as&#xD;
with quick hands, taking ofi'the robes of the&#xD;
contvent, she attired herself in the rich gar-&#xD;
ments and jewels we have mentioned.- Then,&#xD;
with a proud step, entering the chapel, the&#xD;
beautiful woman swept to the altar, where&#xD;
pale tapers were burning around a golden&#xD;
cross.&#xD;
"Long enough," she exclaimed; "long&#xD;

"They are encamped on-the platform  be-i&#xD;

The Indyturnedand beheld on the plat-&#xD;
form, the encampment of the gipsies. In&#xD;
the midst of the olive copse, a space of about&#xD;
sixty' feet in diameter had been cleared.&#xD;
This elaring was surrounded by tent cloth,&#xD;
suspended from one tree to another. In the&#xD;
midst of it burned a large fire, and above the&#xD;
daies hung an enormous kettle suspended&#xD;
from a stick, that was held in the branchings&#xD;
of two'upright poles. Savory steams arose,&#xD;
whenever a cone with an orange-colored,&#xD;
shriveled up face, who held'the important&#xD;
office of cook, lifted .the cover of the kettle&#xD;
and stirred its contents with a wooden ladle.&#xD;
Then would the brown -children that, almost&#xD;
entirely naked, surrounded the fire, utter&#xD;
yells of joy 'ii anticipation of the coming&#xD;
meal; and even their parents who were lol-&#xD;
ling in the laziest attitudes,.eA the ground,&#xD;
would make impatient movements, or urge&#xD;
the old crone to finish her task, by some flat-&#xD;
tering remark. &#xD;
It was a beautiful picture. The gipsies,&#xD;
with their dark complexion, raven hair, but&#xD;
gaudily colored habiliments,laying around&#xD;
,the' bright flashing fire, with the dark see-,&#xD;
thidg mysterious looking pot hanging over it;&#xD;
the tent, cloth draped in loose folds, from&#xD;
branch to branch; the intensely dark green&#xD;
olive wooi'beyond, all motionless:and silent;&#xD;
and, above all, the beautiful blue sky with&#xD;
its stars and golden moon.&#xD;
The lady then entered the cave, followed&#xD;
by Massor, and set down on the couch of&#xD;
Olin s.,I&#xD;
"Our plans are all arranged; and it is only&#xD;
necessary now, for you, Senora, to promise&#xD;
strict adherence to my directions. In the&#xD;
altered-position you will occupy, should our&#xD;
pltns succeed, immense power is at your&#xD;
disposal. The exercise ' of this power I will&#xD;
require once in a while, for my own benefit,&#xD;
or the benefit of my friends," -&#xD;
"I am  ready to yield such aid to you, in&#xD;
reward&amp;amp;r your services," replied the lady.&#xD;
"Thltis all; and now Iwill leave-you to&#xD;
rest, for a few hours. Good night, Donna&#xD;
O oria," and the gipsy left the cavern. I&#xD;
At the mention of her name the lady star-&#xD;
&#xD;
tedland sunk back into deep-revery, which;&#xD;
was finally broken, by a shout of the gipsies&#xD;
below. She rose slowly, murmuring:&#xD;
"Massor is right; Sister Fia hasdisappear-&#xD;
ed forever, and DONNA GLORIA DA GoEZzen-&#xD;
ters-theworld again. It is very lonelyhere,"&#xD;
she added, looking up  t-the rocky projec-&#xD;
tions encrdsted with cry tals, that reflected&#xD;
the light of the fire in bright colors. From&#xD;
the walls'the moss hung in fringe-like ten-&#xD;
drils,and' as the fresh night wind wavedithese&#xD;
delicate plants, they cast large and ghostly&#xD;
shadows over the rocks. The cave was al-&#xD;
ways aL rather chilling and lonely place, ek-&#xD;
cept perhaps to naturalists; and at' height,&#xD;
with a fitful fire chasing the darknets over&#xD;
the walls; the air lifting the feathery mosses&#xD;
and'waking faint moans from the holes ind&#xD;
crevices of the roof; with, the dark branches&#xD;
bending and creaking around the entrance,&#xD;
it was peculiarly lonely and sad. Doina&#xD;
Gloria, by which name we shall designate&#xD;
her, seemed to think so, and, therefore, drew&#xD;
the bed of skins-to the mouth of the cave,&#xD;
from whence se could witness the gambols&#xD;
and the conversation of the gipsies in the&#xD;
campbelow.&#xD;
ThAy had finished supper, and the empty&#xD;
kettle testified the justice done to the meal.&#xD;
One ofsthem, a handsome young fellow occu&#xD;
pied a prominent position at the fire,and was&#xD;
preparing to comply witly the request of the&#xD;
others, and to tell a story.&#xD;
"I do not remember any story at present,"&#xD;
he began, "but I will relate to you an occur-&#xD;
rence that happened several years ago, and&#xD;
in which I took a part."&#xD;
One of the gipsies trimmed the fire, while&#xD;
the others composed themselves to listei.-&#xD;
A haze of of glittering sparks shot out info&#xD;
the darkness, and a bright tongue of flame&#xD;
east a momentary light over the quiet-woods.&#xD;
After a moment of hesitation the gipsy be-&#xD;
gan.&#xD;
"It may now be four years ago, since I&#xD;
followed the trade of beggar in the renown-&#xD;
ed city of Coimbra. It is a rich town, an4&#xD;
the residence of many noble families; in-&#xD;
deed, there,asweet-voiced beggar ata church&#xD;

8                       THE    FAT&#xD;
but aspiring to business above my profe&#xD;
. ion, bad to leave the city. However to th&#xD;
tale.&#xD;
"A noble family by the name of Gom&#xD;
lived there; they were not wealthy, but e&#xD;
ceedingly proud, and good reason they ha&#xD;
to be so, for their blood was of the noble&#xD;
in Portugal. Opposite to the Universit&#xD;
lived Donna Maria da Gomez, who was&#xD;
widow, and ner only daughter Donna GT(&#xD;
ina. Oh, but Donna Gloria was a beautify&#xD;
maiden, and proud like a queen. She ha&#xD;
an uncle, who was a bishop, and a steri&#xD;
severe man,thathad no mercy with the fault&#xD;
of others, and believed himself faultless; h&#xD;
superintended her education, and kept he&#xD;
almost as close as a nun. Well, I often beg&#xD;
ged at the door of the University. On&#xD;
morning Don Diego da Azambuja, the soi&#xD;
and heir of the old duke, eyed me for som&#xD;
moments, and then skid: "Thou art a smar&#xD;
fellow, I believe."&#xD;
I bowed, and replied modestly: thanl&#xD;
your highness for the compliment," at th&#xD;
same time extending my palm.&#xD;
"I am willing to reward thee well,for eas2&#xD;
service" he continued,dropping a gold piece&#xD;
into my hand.&#xD;
"The holy saints bless your highness;I&#xD;
will poignard the first noble in the land, a-&#xD;
your word," I ejaculated, gratefully, think&#xD;
ing ofcourse that he required some servic&#xD;
of this sort. But Don Diego turning quite&#xD;
red, said, with a slightly stammering voice&#xD;
"Silence fellow; dost know Donna Gloria da&#xD;
Gomes ?'&#xD;
"Do I know the greatest beauty of Portu-&#xD;
gal? She drops a piece of money into my&#xD;
hand, every morning at the church door.-&#xD;
Oh she is kind and beautiful!" He seemed&#xD;
much pleased at my reply.&#xD;
"Take this note and deliver it into her&#xD;
hands to-morrow morning." And he left a&#xD;
. letter tied with silver thread in my hands.&#xD;
"The Donna shall receive it," was my re-&#xD;
Ply.&#xD;
"Next morning I waited at the church&#xD;
door, and when Donna Gloria dropped, as&#xD;
usual,apieee of money into my hand, I slip-&#xD;
pad the letter into her wide sleeve. She&#xD;
turned scarlet and passed on. The morning&#xD;
&#xD;
*1&#xD;
&#xD;
as- after, I left another letter from Don Diego in&#xD;
he her sleeve,and on the third dayshe dropped&#xD;
a small rose colored note and a large gold&#xD;
ez piece into my hand. The piece I kept,.and&#xD;
x- the letter was delivered to Don Diego, who&#xD;
d rewarded me richly. This correspondence&#xD;
st was continued for some time and proved a&#xD;
y, profitable trade to me.&#xD;

y gold embroidery, and fringed with white fur.&#xD;
e An underdress of gold brocade glittered in&#xD;
front, where the skirts were open and looped,&#xD;

t was adorned with a wreath of white roses,&#xD;
and a diamond necklace flashed on her swan&#xD;

:  "And Don Menezes walked at her side,his&#xD;
face beaming with joy. A rich dress of&#xD;
purple velvet slashed and - lined with&#xD;
cloth of gold, admirably adorned his fine&#xD;
person. A string of pearls hung around his&#xD;
headgear, on one side of which, threecuperb&#xD;
plumes were held by a diamond brooch.-&#xD;
His sword also hung from a jeweled belt.&#xD;

distributed to us; the bridegroom had even&#xD;
ordered wine,and all mendicants of Coimbra&#xD;
made merry.&#xD;

bishop, Donna Gloria's uncle, went - to the&#xD;
chapel, and when he found his niece, in her&#xD;
rich marriage costume, laying all pale and&#xD;
cold upon the marble, he uttered frightful&#xD;
imprecations on herhead. Three daysafter,&#xD;
he carried her away from Coimbra,and placed&#xD;
her into some convent. I heard this after-&#xD;
wards, as well as, that the severest penances&#xD;
were laid upon the poor Donna. God help&#xD;
her, she was beautiful and good 1" and the&#xD;
gipsy concluded his story with a grave bow.&#xD;
Many of the gipsy women had sunk to&#xD;
sleep during the recital of the tale. And&#xD;
the rest now composed themselves to enjoy&#xD;
a short nap on their grassy beds. But from&#xD;
above the gipsy encampment,,from the mouthy&#xD;
of the cavern, the night wind bore away thPe&#xD;
sound of sobs and sighs; and bitter fees&#xD;
watered the little flowers that waved Afrom&#xD;
the edge of the hight.&#xD;
The face of nature blushedwiththe scarlet&#xD;
of morning. All over the bounding sea and&#xD;
the quiet verdant-hills, over the villages, the&#xD;
fields and the silent green woods, the bright&#xD;
red flush of morning was borne by the breeze.&#xD;
And then solitary beams of light flashed&#xD;
through the scarlet East, on;the sea and- the&#xD;
hills, and disappeared again. At last .the&#xD;
waves broke into a smile of joy, as a flood of&#xD;
golden sunshine swept over them; and the&#xD;
trees-shook their branches to the morning&#xD;
wind; and the hills seemed so many fairy&#xD;
queens in diamond robes, as every dewdrop&#xD;
f blazed and flashed in the glorious light.&#xD;
Small birds, thatgencrally greet the morn-&#xD;
&#xD;
ment's consideration I took the letter, and&#xD;
told" the Don that I, would do his bidding.&#xD;
Without the slightest hesitation, I entered&#xD;
Donna Gloria's house and pushing aside the&#xD;
servants that opposed me, made my way in-I&#xD;
to the festal hall, and, with a low:obeisance,4&#xD;
delivered the thanks of the beggars to the&#xD;
bridegroom, in a few extravagant sentences.&#xD;
Thecompany laughed,and Don Menezes bade&#xD;
me approach to receive-a golden donation in&#xD;
return. This opportunity I waited, and&#xD;
while receiving his money, dropped the note&#xD;
into Donna Gloria's lap. She started,atfirst&#xD;
seeing me, and covered the noteimmediately&#xD;
with her hand. #Two minutes afterwards I&#xD;
was with Don Diego.   -        '&#xD;

A rustle, and the bride appeared, and threw&#xD;
herself into Don Diego's arms. She eloped&#xD;
with him that night. They did not leave&#xD;
the . city, but hastened to a small chapel in&#xD;
the suburbs, where Don Diego had a priest&#xD;
in readiness. The monk was to marry them&#xD;
-and I to serve as witness. The ceremony had&#xD;
just begun, when there was a great uproar&#xD;
outside. The doors were thrown open 'and&#xD;
the old Duke of Azambija, Don Diego's&#xD;
father entered, accompanied by a corps of&#xD;
followers-&#xD;
"God I# thanked, that he has spared me&#xD;
this disgrace I" cried the old duke, when he&#xD;
saw that they were not yet married. "Don&#xD;
Diego, you will immediately enter my car-&#xD;
riage," commanded the enraged father, and&#xD;
as ',the young man, pale as death, sank on&#xD;
his knees, the duke-signed to his servants.-&#xD;
They surrounded the Don, and in spite of&#xD;
his struggles bore him to the . carriage. A&#xD;

mit of Mount Cintra.&#xD;
- Early in the morning a dustcovered gipsy&#xD;
had arrived, and brought a scroll to Massor;&#xD;
on the scroll wete the following words:&#xD;
"The King will proceed by water to' Be-&#xD;
lem; Hereturnson horseback atfive o'clock,&#xD;
and crosses the chestnut grove adjoining the&#xD;
royal park, on his way to the palace."&#xD;
Masior .immediately communicated the&#xD;
contents of-the scroll to Donna Gloria. Af-&#xD;
ter considering,she said: "Then we will start&#xD;
now, and when we reach Belem repose for a&#xD;
little while in a hostelrie, or the house of a&#xD;
friend."&#xD;
Massor assented and, in a few minutes,the&#xD;
horses were brought. Donna Gloria, still in&#xD;
her monk's habit, was aided to mount, while&#xD;
Massor lightly jumped on his prancing steed.&#xD;
The sun stood in the west and was pre-&#xD;
paring to set, bygathering purple and rosy&#xD;
clouds, around him, when a gallant train of&#xD;
cavaliers entered the chestnut grove that&#xD;
bounded the western sideof the royal parks.&#xD;
The road which wound its irregular and&#xD;
serpentine line through this grove, was bor-&#xD;
dered by clumps of trees, that, howeverwere&#xD;
sometimes, supersededd by low straggling&#xD;
bushes.&#xD;
The train of cavaliers entered the chestnut&#xD;
grove. In advance, mounted on a coal black&#xD;
steed of great grace and activity, rode Juan&#xD;
the Third, King of Portugal. He was then&#xD;
in his twentieth year, and but slightly tinged&#xD;
with that sombre religious enthusiasm, the&#xD;
effects of which, afterward corroded hismind&#xD;
and weakened his body. . His forehead was&#xD;
not high, but very broadand smooth; his&#xD;
nose straight and small with expanded nos.&#xD;
triue; his eye darkly and softly brown, with&#xD;
bushy eyebrows; and his mouth small and,&#xD;
beautiful. He had black hair; and a clear&#xD;
lark'complexion:, a black beard,of the style&#xD;
now called goatee, graced his chin,-and small&#xD;
moustaches aurmounted his upper lip. Cov-&#xD;
&#xD;

erally looked severe,,but when he smiled a&#xD;

, tures. A d-ressof blue velvet, and a cloak of&#xD;
the same material fitted well, to his finely&#xD;
shaped 'limbs, though the color did not suit&#xD;
his style of face. From his 'cap waved a&#xD;
magnifient scarlet plume.&#xD;
Behind the King, yet nearenough to reply&#xD;
to his questions rode hisfavorite courtier,&#xD;
Don Alphonso da Costa, countof Almaveda.&#xD;
He was handsome young man, with a fair&#xD;
and brilliant complexion, bright blue eyes,&#xD;
brown hair that fell in long curls to his shoul-&#xD;
ders, and a happy expression over his face.&#xD;
He wore, like the King, a small moustacbe,&#xD;
but his chin was smooth. A dress. of blue&#xD;
and white satin; and a black cloak like&#xD;
those generally worn at that timeinPortugal,&#xD;
made, up his attire.&#xD;
The rest of the King's suite as they moved&#xD;
in the sunlight glowed with every color, an4&#xD;
sparkled with jewels.              '&#xD;
The King had just turned an angle of the&#xD;
road, when he suddenly checked his horse,&#xD;
and with mingled feelings of astonishment&#xD;
and perplexity depicted on his countenance&#xD;
he exclaimed: "Santa madre de Dios!" :.&#xD;
The suite immediately halted, but,.Don&#xD;
Alphonso pressed forward, to see what had&#xD;
so astonished the monarch.&#xD;
CHAPTER         I1.&#xD;
KING JUAN       THE   THIRD.&#xD;
Ot a small patch of grassy ground stood&#xD;
Donna Gloria, in her rich satin robes,&#xD;
sparkling with jewels. Around her bloomed&#xD;
a thousand bright colored flowers, and the&#xD;
chestnut trees formed a dark back ground&#xD;
to her figure.&#xD;
The king surprised at thesight of a lady&#xD;
of marvelous beauty in splendid attire and&#xD;
quite alone in the chestnut grove, had halt-&#xD;
ed, exclaiming:&#xD;
"Holy mother of God I"         -&#xD;
When Don Alphonso had spurred for-&#xD;
ward,. and seen   the lady, his surprise&#xD;
equalled that of the king. Juan turned to&#xD;
him, and inquired: "Who ean she bg"-&#xD;
"I cah not imagine; but if your majesty&#xD;
will command, I will, soon fAd out."-&#xD;
&#xD;
On, PLOTS AND&#xD;
"Go,'Don Alphonso;but inquire of her,&#xD;
with all respect," Tejoined tlie king. He&#xD;
waited impatiently, while the young noble-,&#xD;
man dismounated, and leading his horse by&#xD;
the bridle, approached thelady.&#xD;
"Fair stranger,"' he began, doffing his&#xD;
cap, "eur graeioti king would fain know the&#xD;
nameof the beautiful lady that has so sud-&#xD;
denly appeared before -him, and the business&#xD;
which took-her to court."&#xD;
' " Then, sir courtier, tell the king, that&#xD;
but to him, will I disclose my name and&#xD;
business," replied Donna Gloria, returning,&#xD;
with a graceful wave of the hand the pro-&#xD;
found salutation of Don Alphonso.&#xD;
" But the king desires to know immediate-&#xD;
ly," pa-sisted the courtier doubting whether&#xD;
he should bear the bold reply of the lady&#xD;
to his tnastee'.'&#xD;
"You have heard my answer, sir, bear it&#xD;
to the-king," *as the proud reply.&#xD;
lDon Alphtbso returned, and reported to&#xD;
hig ihipatient master the reply of the lady.&#xD;
Juan, his 'edtiosity excited to the utmost,&#xD;
rode forward' until he was opposite to the&#xD;
ladiy, and then in the tone of gallantry,&#xD;
then current at the Portuguese court, ad-&#xD;
dressed her:&#xD;
'"By our lady, beautiful dame, we can&#xD;
not explain your sudden appearance all&#xD;
alone in this wood unless we suppose you&#xD;
one of the charming fairies Persian tales&#xD;
speak of, and which, by 'your wondrous&#xD;
beauty, ybu are well fitted to be."&#xD;
"And like those fairies, I meet a good&#xD;
and valiant prince, of whom  I ask as's-&#xD;
tance," replied Gloria. '&#xD;
"It is granted, by St. George; for who&#xD;
could-refuse any thing to go beautiful a&#xD;
lady ?"&#xD;
"Youi majesty is renowned for gallantry&#xD;
and fame does not belie you."&#xD;
" It is easy to be gallant where the heart&#xD;
feels love," rejoined Juan. "Ia what can I&#xD;
be of service to you, lady ?"&#xD;
- "My business Imust be conunicated to&#xD;
your 'majesty alone:- O sire," continued the&#xD;
beautiful wdinan, kneeling on the grass and&#xD;
raisin her- white arms in the attitude of&#xD;
prayer, "I appear to you alone in a solitary&#xD;

The king, 'enchanted by the beauty, and&#xD;
touched by the words of the unknown,'has.&#xD;
tily dismounted, and raised hei from the,&#xD;
ground.,&#xD;
"I have given you my royal word, ldf"&#xD;
he said, "and since you are a stranger in&#xD;
Lisbon will you accept of' our hospitality,&#xD;
and reside with our cousin the Couatess iof&#xD;
Solani, in the  summer pavilion of the&#xD;
palace ?"&#xD;
"I will not refuse, your 'majesty's kitd-&#xD;
ness," replied Donna Gloria.&#xD;
" Thank you, fair lady I" exclaimed the&#xD;
king, and gallantly kissed her whit' hand.&#xD;
He then remounted, and dining o- the&#xD;
suite, who with surprise haid listened to this&#xD;
conversation,- but did not dare by the least&#xD;
change of face to testify their feelings, the&#xD;
king said:&#xD;
"Gentlemen. we will proceed on our way;&#xD;
you Don Alphouso and Don Duarte will&#xD;
stay with our guest, until the carriage with&#xD;
a duenna arrives which Don Carlos notifies&#xD;
our cousin to send. On, then I" And the&#xD;
king with a bow continued his way, while&#xD;
the lords commissioned to bear the lady&#xD;
company dismounted, and Don Carlos&#xD;
spurred his horse across the wood, in the&#xD;
direction of the summer pavilion.'  The&#xD;
king's suite, as they passed7 Gloria bowed&#xD;
low.&#xD;
In a short time, a carriage drawn by two&#xD;
fine horses rolled through the wood, and&#xD;
stopped where Dohna Gloria stood. Al-&#xD;
phonso opened the door for her, and Don&#xD;
Duarte helped her to enter.&#xD;
The carriage rolled away.&#xD;
An old-lady, dressed in the hight of couft&#xD;
fashion, and yet in colors, suited ito her&#xD;
age, occupied the fr6nt seat. He- appear--&#xD;

The moduntain sides presented a gloomy&#xD;

On inadessible butments of granite, birds of&#xD;
prey had btiilt their nests; their hoarse shrill'&#xD;

they went o0t in search of food.&#xD;
It' was a fewdays after theevents wehave&#xD;

In a dark gorge behind the last of these&#xD;
mountains, sat two men on a rocky fragment&#xD;
thatjutted from the mountain side' across a&#xD;
black silent brook winding around the base.&#xD;
The men were engaged in earnest conversa-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"It is a thing-of necessity," saidtheo elder,,&#xD;
a tall and noble looking man of about' twen.&#xD;
ty. seven years. "If we do not make away&#xD;
with him, the noblest and best of Israel did&#xD;
at the stake. Were there a choice, I would&#xD;
choose anything but that; but there is nW&#xD;
alternative. Either Firma Fidafalls, or the&#xD;
Inquisition is- introduced"&#xD;
"But'brother," replied the otheri"will not&#xD;

"But murder will stain our soul; by sa-&#xD;

the shuddering teply.&#xD;
"My gentle Enrique, jou view'this thing&#xD;
wrongly. We are executing a. doom, resol-&#xD;

of ou' nation, as a dreadful necessity. And&#xD;
then,is the command of'Iterael's prinee,whoe&#xD;

"And is the Lord's-command, not above&#xD;

After trifling their pockets of all the gold&#xD;
they contained, and taking every; ornament&#xD;

bandits carefully barred.the door.&#xD;

his teeth in impotent rage, and tried to break&#xD;
thercords which bound him.,-   .-&#xD;
"Is it not possible'that we might gain the&#xD;
bandits to our- cause, brother? and they&#xD;
would then kill Firma Vida and blood would&#xD;
not soil our -hands." Enriquesaid this in-&#xD;
quiringly.&#xD;
"The work would still be ours, brother.-&#xD;
I can not comprehend your subtle sophistry,&#xD;
which would throw, the guilt on the tool and&#xD;
free its employer.. Besides. no bandit would&#xD;
attack a priest' replied Hernando,&#xD;
"Brother," cried Enrique:in a voice trem-&#xD;
bling with joy, "my hands are free. The&#xD;
bands were tied so loosely that I could slip&#xD;
,my hands out. Wait, and I will undo your&#xD;
cords." He proceeded to free his. brother.&#xD;
The room was very dark. . By touch they&#xD;
examined its walls.&#xD;
"Here stands a large chest, but it is&#xD;
locked," whispered Hernando.&#xD;
,"And here is another," replied Enrique;&#xD;
"wait brother I will force it open."&#xD;
,"You can not do it without tools,and the&#xD;
robbers have.taken our swords and daggers,"&#xD;
replied, the elder,                  .&#xD;
"Come and help me, Hernando; perhaps&#xD;
our united strength might force open the!&#xD;
lid."&#xD;
After several unsuccessful efforts, they at&#xD;
last despaired and were about to give up the&#xD;
task, when Hernoando was startled by a sud.&#xD;
deg cry ofpain from his brother.'&#xD;
&#xD;
"Great Heaven! what is it," he exclaimed,&#xD;
as he turned to the spot from whence the&#xD;
'sound. proeeded.'&#xD;
, "'Tis nothing;" replied Enrique, "my foot&#xD;
slipped and struck some subtance on the&#xD;
ground."'&#xD;
"2ee what it is."&#xD;
"'Tis an axe !" lie cried in a joyful tone.&#xD;
Hernando taking theaxefrom-his brother's&#xD;
hand gave two or three stout blows on the&#xD;
chest, but was interrupted 'by his brother&#xD;
who exclaimed: "For heaven's sake, hold!&#xD;
the noise will bring the robbers here."&#xD;
Hernando,immediately-stopped and listen.&#xD;
ed for some moments. The noise had not&#xD;
attracted any attention. He now carefully&#xD;
inserted the axe between the box' and lid;&#xD;
using it as a lever, he forced open the lid in&#xD;
a few moments.&#xD;
The breaking of the look caused a crash&#xD;
which, however, penetrated not beyond the&#xD;
thick rocky walls of the cavern. "Bercau-&#xD;
tious brother," said Enrique.&#xD;
The chest was full of gold and jewels, in&#xD;
the form of necklaces, bracelets and .similar&#xD;
ornaments. This the brothers ascertained&#xD;
by touch. Suddenly, Hernando cried: "1I&#xD;
have found 'a dagger, and here is also a&#xD;
sword I" and he drew from the chest the&#xD;
aims; for amongst other articles of value the&#xD;
banditti had jeweled arms too. Enriquecal-&#xD;
so possessed himself of a sword.&#xD;
"But," he said, "of what avail are arms&#xD;
against a securely barred door I"&#xD;
"True; too true !" After a few moments of&#xD;
silence Hernando cried: "I have it come&#xD;
brother," and they hastened to the door.-&#xD;
It was barred on the outside by two'. strong&#xD;
wooden planks, laid in massive iron holders&#xD;
from the wall on one,. side to that on' the&#xD;
other; thus completely crossing the door.-&#xD;
Hernando' took the sword, and unsheathing&#xD;
its thin, but strong blade, inserted it between&#xD;
the door- and the wall. It was done with&#xD;
perfect ease. He then pushed it up to where&#xD;
the plank crossed the door, and tried to lift&#xD;
the heavy bar. It was 'impossible.' The&#xD;
bliAe turned in his hand, and would have&#xD;
broken, 'had he not relaxed his efforts. In&#xD;

forgotten something, and he again ascended&#xD;
the steps and entered the bandit's den.-&#xD;
Enrique and the lady waited in almost un-&#xD;
sufferable anxiety.&#xD;
A few minutes elapsed and Hernando had&#xD;
not returned. 'The night was still as death.&#xD;
Thick drops of sweat\ rolled from Enrique's&#xD;
brow and his heart stopped,with anxiety; a&#xD;
few moments longer and Hernando was still&#xD;
absent. The night wind rustled through the&#xD;
willows. Enrique arose and began to re-as-&#xD;
cend the slippery steps. The lurid light&#xD;
that -shone from the-rocky entrance on the&#xD;
black. brook was intercepted. It was Her&#xD;
nando. A joyous glance-a sigh of relief-&#xD;
gnd the brothers were seated in the skiff.&#xD;
Hernando carried a bundle wrapped in his&#xD;
silken scarf, and held a parcel, enclosed in&#xD;
a cover of clotn of gold. After the bark had&#xD;
floated, down the stream for some time, and&#xD;
was distant enough from the cave, Hernan-&#xD;
do used the oars, and Enrique steered to&#xD;
the- opening in the willows, where they 'had&#xD;
embarked. They landed and shoved. the&#xD;
skiff into the stream. ,&#xD;
The brothers now hastened to find the se-&#xD;
cret place amongst the rocks, where they had&#xD;
hidden theirhorses, before their capture.-&#xD;
Fortunately they had escaped the notice of&#xD;
the bandits. They mounted, Hernando ac-&#xD;
comodating the lady with a-seat, since his&#xD;
animal was the stronger.,&#xD;
"Now,brother," said Hernando,"let us ride&#xD;
slowly, and with great caution, around the&#xD;
base of the mountain, to where the road en-&#xD;
ters Moncorvo. Choose those places where&#xD;
the shadow ip deepest, 4an1 the grasp softest;&#xD;
for I am very much mistaken if many ban-&#xD;
dits arenot around, and we need both co-&#xD;
ver and silence for our safety."&#xD;
Enrique nodded, and the brothers rode on.&#xD;
The morning star flamed in the sky and&#xD;
greyQbscurity began to veil the azure dark-&#xD;
ness of.night&amp;amp; s.&#xD;
Suddenly, Enrique stopped and beckoned&#xD;
$o biabrother. "Histi the sound of steps I"&#xD;
he whispered.&#xD;
It was the tread of men.&#xD;
Hernando and Enrique retreated behind&#xD;
one of several clumps of trees, that 'ringed&#xD;
&#xD;
the foot, ofthe mountain, likean emerald&#xD;
chain.&#xD;
They were some bandits returning from&#xD;
the depredations of the night and conversing&#xD;
with each other. "We captured two.. fid&#xD;
birds, last night," said one; "and call mea a&#xD;
skulking coward, if they are not of conse-&#xD;
quence."&#xD;
"I hope we'll lift a heavy ransom then,"&#xD;
said another. "I must buy me a newsword&#xD;
knot, and golden cross for my sweet-heart''&#xD;
"Golden birds can not come amisa to me,'&#xD;
interposed another tall, burly fellow. 'I&#xD;
think these two youngsters were especially&#xD;
sent by heaven on my account;"' aed' he&#xD;
piously turned up his eyes.&#xD;
"Why, what makes thee think so, thoa big&#xD;
bellied, wooden headed bully?" criedithe&#xD;
first robber.&#xD;
"Because I owe an account to'my father&#xD;
confessor."&#xD;
"And promised. to pay him from the neAt&#xD;
ransom, I'll warrant,"&#xD;
"'Tis true; and father Cyprian, shall get&#xD;
his money."&#xD;
"Why, thou dull-eyed fool, I never thought&#xD;
the father would lend thee money; but if he&#xD;
has, by the holy virgi's :rown, you'll pay&#xD;
good interest;" and the robber laughed.&#xD;
"'Tie not for money lent," resumed the&#xD;
tall one, "but for sins forgiven. The father&#xD;
has given me absolution at various-times,&#xD;
for which I owe him money yet."&#xD;
"Let us bear thy account; I have one to&#xD;
settle with the father too," said another ban-&#xD;
dit,&#xD;
"I owe him for one farmer robbed, two&#xD;
pistols, for two ladies eight pistoles and for&#xD;
a fat citizen three pistoles."&#xD;
The robbers had now 4rr' v opposite the&#xD;
place where the fugitives were\on cealedi,&#xD;
They trembled with apprehension ett they&#xD;
might be discovered.I&#xD;
But not only were they coveredwith dark&#xD;
shadow, but the bandits were sleepy aid&#xD;
careless. Joking and singing, they passed&#xD;
on.&#xD;
At seven in the morning, the brothers ar-&#xD;
rived at the gate of a stately house in Mon-&#xD;

received them with great kindness, and re-&#xD;

The side walls fronting the Higlistret' wore&#xD;

through the streets, and howled past -nar-&#xD;

But Hernando, at the bottom of his heart&#xD;
cursed this fight, that took him away from&#xD;
.i' friends, 'relatives, and above all from&#xD;
one whom he loved more than life.&#xD;
-But there was no doubt, in both their&#xD;
minds, but that iron necessity compelled&#xD;
'their absence. "The discovery of,' their&#xD;
journey to the North, the way they had ta-&#xD;
ken, their presence in 'the Moncorvo moun-&#xD;
tains, at the time of the murder, all could&#xD;
easily be ascertained, and used to fasten the&#xD;
eharg upon them. They had intended to&#xD;
accomplish the deed themselves, had gained&#xD;
possession of the priest's head and the em-&#xD;
peror's letter, and delivered them to Dan&#xD;

among them, a traitor might be found. An&#xD;
ignominous deathawaited them on discovery,&#xD;
while a timely abseneemight throw suspi--&#xD;

Wevill now turn to the bound and gag-&#xD;
ged Margarita that was held securely on&#xD;
the crupper of-the saddle by the guide, and&#xD;
was an unwilling and unwelcome compan-&#xD;
ion of 'the young men.&#xD;
She had, by the scene in the hall, where&#xD;
Fidaro so unceremoniously treated her, ex-&#xD;
cited the flerdest jealousy in the heart of a&#xD;
little dried up superannuated footman,who&#xD;
went by the name of her lover. The foot.&#xD;
man called Matto, vented his jealousy in&#xD;
divers violent expletives; he swore by every&#xD;
saint in the calendar, to drown'himself or&#xD;
cut his throat. Matto's oaths and protesta-&#xD;
tions made such impression on the tender&#xD;
heart of Margarita, that the spinster, resol-&#xD;
ved not to lose both strings of her bow,&#xD;
conquered the rumblings and pains of her&#xD;
throbbing abdomen, to sooth the indignant&#xD;
lover. Nay she even went further, and&#xD;
promised 'to meet him in the chestnut grove,&#xD;
while the attention of all the servants would&#xD;
be engaged by thefeast. Thusthelongingand&#xD;
amorous virgin happened to overhear Her-&#xD;
nando and "Enrique's conversation. The&#xD;
servant of Don ,Lionel discovered her slyly&#xD;
retreating,and secured the valuable prize in&#xD;
the manner above described.&#xD;
Now, far be it from us, to state that the&#xD;
virtuous Margarita had any objection to&#xD;

borne quietly by any female living. And'.&#xD;
now, riding on a hard trotting mule, whose&#xD;
every step brought into agitation the 'parts&#xD;
Fidaro had wounded-was horrible. She&#xD;
was helpless, however, and could do nothing.&#xD;
Had she been free, there exists little doubt,&#xD;
but she would have swallowed both mule&#xD;
and rider.&#xD;
- The morning flamed and glowed and&#xD;
turned red and orange and purple, and sent&#xD;
the sun all fresh and golden upon the blue&#xD;
sky, when our riders saw the sea foam&#xD;
around the cliff of Cintra.&#xD;
Hernando inquired the name of their&#xD;
guide.&#xD;
"Pinnoro, Senor," replied the servant.&#xD;
"Does our road lead along the shore ?"&#xD;
"It does, for one day's journey, senor,"&#xD;

?'H1E COUNCIL L BOA RD.&#xD;
In a circular apartment, tapestried through-&#xD;
out, with dark red damask, the council were&#xD;
assembled. A table covered with the same&#xD;
material which hung from the walls, occu-&#xD;
pied the center of the apartment. Around&#xD;
three sides of it sat, on chairs of a brightly&#xD;
polished black wood, the members of the&#xD;
council. On a gilded chair at the head of&#xD;
the table, raised on a small platform, sat the&#xD;
king. Don Antonio was-speaking:&#xD;
"This document," s'd4 he, taking one&#xD;
from the table, "signed by the chief justice&#xD;
of Trazos, shows the deposition of the mayor&#xD;

The old priest murmured thus, all alone&#xD;
in the reception room  Gloria had ordered&#xD;
that he should be admitted immediately.&#xD;
In the ante room, 'a orowdof courtiers&#xD;
awaited the pleasure of the favorite. They&#xD;
talked loudly and iherrily, and witty sayings,&#xD;
on almost every high personage, flew about.&#xD;
Suddenly they were silent, as Donna Glo-&#xD;
ria, ' who had finished her ride, flushed and&#xD;
heated with the morning's exercise entered.&#xD;
All bowed low.&#xD;
"What has brought Don Pedro from the&#xD;
side of his young wife, this beautiful  orn-&#xD;
ing," inquired Gloria, stopping before a&#xD;
young and handsome man.&#xD;
" To assure myself of your health,Donna."&#xD;
"This is not, all ?"'&#xD;
"I also easn2 to make a request."&#xD;
"Letus hear it."&#xD;
"My sister Maria wishes to become lady&#xD;
of hopor to the dowager queen; could-"&#xD;
"Itshall be attended to, Senor."&#xD;
"My sister will thank you in person; and&#xD;
allow me to send you, by her, a beautiful&#xD;
diamond, which I selected for you."&#xD;
Donna Gloria passed on.&#xD;
She again stopped before a man on whom&#xD;
sat an air of importance. His face was red&#xD;
and blown up; his attire gay and in bad&#xD;
taste.&#xD;
" What gives us the pleasure to see you,&#xD;
valiant captain? Itmust be a glorious thing,&#xD;
to stand upon the deck of your ship and&#xD;
look over the broad Tagus and the glittering&#xD;
sea, this fine morning! Be on your guard,&#xD;
captain, for I intend to surprise you, one of&#xD;
these morzings, and to take the Santissima&#xD;
Trinidad liy storm."'&#xD;
"Take her, lady; and her captain to&#xD;
boot I" cried the rough seaman, in undis.&#xD;
guised admiration.&#xD;
Donna Gloria was not displeased; she re-&#xD;
plied, smilingly:&#xD;
"I thauk you, captain; I shall remember&#xD;
your affer, and perhaps one day remind you&#xD;
of it." The lady paw pensive, during the&#xD;
latter part of this ,eply. . .&#xD;
" But what have you to ask, Captain Poi-&#xD;
Ia?" xhe inquired,&#xD;
&#xD;
"If it please your excellence, my nephew,&#xD;

request you to speak a word for Juan Poi"&#xD;
Ia," and the sailor opened hie iouth in er&#xD;
pectation of Gloria's reply.&#xD;
"The matter shall be investigated," was&#xD;
Gloria's reply, and' she signed to the page&#xD;
following, to make a note of it on a'tablet of&#xD;
ivory, which he carried.&#xD;
Gloria passed on, and entered the 'recep-&#xD;
tion room.&#xD;
Seeing the priest, she exclaimed:&#xD;
"Oh, father Marcus, I hope you have not&#xD;
been long kept waiting I" -&#xD;
The priest merely answered by a ow.&#xD;
"But now," continued the lady'whose ani-I&#xD;
mal spirits had been raised by themorning's&#xD;
exercise; "now, you must share my pastt"&#xD;
" Your!excellency willexcuse die, I hope,"&#xD;
said the priest, seriously, "for I have broken&#xD;
my fast already. Let us proceed to the bu-&#xD;
siness for which I was summoned."&#xD;
" Nay, uncourteous priest, you shall even&#xD;
first sip with me, the delicious decoction of&#xD;
Araby. Let us see whether it will put'you&#xD;
in better humor."&#xD;
Father Marcus gave vent to a grumbling&#xD;
sound-half refusal, half unwilling assent.&#xD;
Donna Gloria now sounded the steelen&#xD;
rattle with an energy that brought several&#xD;
pages at once to the apartment.&#xD;
"Will you let me die of hunger!" she noi&#xD;
costed them; " I am here,-with an appetite&#xD;
like a famished beast, in instant danger of&#xD;
starvation, and none attends with my break-&#xD;
fast; bring a cup for father Marcius, too !"&#xD;
In a few moments, one of the pages re-ap-&#xD;
peased with a tray, on which were two small&#xD;
cups of gold, half filled with a syrup-like de-&#xD;
coction of the coffee bean, a silver plate in'&#xD;
the shape of a large grape leaf, heaped wiih&#xD;
delicate pastry, and a silver flagmn of wine,&#xD;
flanked by high Bohemian glasses.&#xD;
" Taste this drink, father, urged Gloria,&#xD;
while she satisfied her appetite.&#xD;
&#xD;
#1&#xD;
&#xD;
"I like not the decoctions' which, in imi-&#xD;
tation of the luxurious Musselmen, we swal-&#xD;
low, the materials from  which they are&#xD;
made, are bought at heavy cost ip foreign&#xD;
lands, while our home agriculture is not&#xD;
patrqnisedor encouraged."&#xD;
"But, to meet you on your own ground,&#xD;
father, does not the consumption of the coffee&#xD;
bean and other Asiatic products give an im.&#xD;
pulpe to the trade with the East; and how&#xD;
much that trade has benefitted Portugal, I&#xD;
need not say."&#xD;
"Let us leave the business of setA te to his&#xD;
majesty's ministers," said the priest.&#xD;
"You are unbearable, this morning,"&#xD;
cried Gloria. "This exceeds even your usu-&#xD;
al moroseness."&#xD;
Father Marcus munched a sugared star,&#xD;
Gloria needed,' however, the priest; and&#xD;
he was deep in the confidence of Juan. She,&#xD;
therefore, said.&#xD;
"Drink a glass of this fiery wine, raised int&#xD;
our own land, on most Catholic mountains,&#xD;
by most Catholic peasants, and then we will&#xD;
proceed to business."&#xD;
Father Marcus finished his glass of wine,&#xD;
and Glorialeft the apartment for the docu-f&#xD;
ments.&#xD;
She returned presently, holding them in P&#xD;
her hand, and signed the page to retire.&#xD;
"Father," she addressed the private sec.&#xD;
retary, "I submit to your scrutiny, 5ocu- fl&#xD;
ments, that, for ought I know, may be of the&#xD;
highest importance. They are written in a&#xD;
cipher which I can not read. Before I de-&#xD;
liver them into your hands, promise me, not&#xD;
to divulge anything contained therein, to h&#xD;
any one, but by my permission."&#xD;
"Suppose, I should refuse to look at 1&#xD;
them ?"                                0&#xD;
"Menial! you deserve to be scourged for&#xD;
such a supposition ! Then I will compel you, o&#xD;
by the commands of your master, to read d(&#xD;
and inte-pret themI"                   b&#xD;
"&amp;amp;[e*di lady," said the priest, awed by&#xD;
1her maimer, and the power he knew her to th&#xD;
possess; "of what advantage will it be to me h&#xD;
Ito read and interpret them to you alone ?Ia&#xD;
Donna Gloria softened at this question.  Io&#xD;
You will have me for your r-iend; if you&#xD;
'desire gel, name the amount.",W&#xD;
&#xD;
"I desire no gold,' replied father Marcus.&#xD;
"What then; explain yourself!"&#xD;
"I must have a promise, upon the hoy&#xD;
eross, to be requited with a service qn yori&#xD;
part."&#xD;
" Name it," cried the lady.&#xD;
"I can not; f know notyet what I mpy&#xD;
require, or wen; you must leave that to my&#xD;
discretion, lady."&#xD;
" But, it is impossible that I should prom-&#xD;
ise to perform, what I know not whether it&#xD;
in my power to do."&#xD;
" Rely on me, lady," said the priest, ",I&#xD;
will not ask too much."&#xD;
'Gloria considered for a moment, and then&#xD;
kissing a golden cross that hung from her&#xD;
neck, said:&#xD;
"I promise"&#xD;
"Give me the papers, then."&#xD;
The priest looked long at them, while&#xD;
Gloria's eyes were bent upon him in expec-&#xD;
tation.&#xD;
"I know not the cipher," he said at last;&#xD;
"but let me take the papers, and by the aid&#xD;
of the cipher-record of the royal secretaries,&#xD;
will interpret them and copy them out in&#xD;
air Portuguese."&#xD;
"Very well," said Gloria; "but if you&#xD;
lay me falsepriest - I"&#xD;
"My life is in your excellency's hand."&#xD;
"True; and I will have your heart's blood&#xD;
or duplicity," replied Gloria,&#xD;
"I have the honor to wish you a good-&#xD;
morning!I"&#xD;
" Let me soon hear from you I'"&#xD;
The priest was gone; Gloria still doubted&#xD;
im.&#xD;
"The papers can implicate me in no way,"&#xD;
he mused, " and while I retain my power&#xD;
ver Juan, father Marcus is in niy hand."&#xD;
Gloria s-mmoned her favorite page, and&#xD;
ordered the curtains, that veiled each win-&#xD;
ow, to -be looped back, and the windows to&#xD;
e opened.&#xD;
Golden' streams of sunlight poured into&#xD;

The door of the apartment opened, and a "Now, may brother, " began Enrique,&#xD;
full, melodious voice said:             "name to me the lady that has captivated&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

"You also love, Enrique! Then you&#xD;
will understand my passion! I love, madly,&#xD;
passionately, and all the more violently be-&#xD;
cause I have tried to conceal it, I love-"&#xD;
and Hernando hesitated.&#xD;
"Whom?"&#xD;
"Donna Rosa Bananda 1"&#xD;
"My bride" ejaculated, in a voice of&#xD;
fearful agony, the thunderstruck Enrique.&#xD;
" THY BIDMII !" retorted Hernando,&#xD;
while all the blood of his body rushed to&#xD;
his head, and swelled the knotted veins and&#xD;
arteries of the brows, until they seemed an&#xD;
angry net of cords. Both were silent for a&#xD;
moment. Then Enrique without a trace of&#xD;
the usual gentleness in his voice and mien,&#xD;
said sternly:&#xD;
"My bride. The maiden whom I love,&#xD;
and whose heart has been given to me, in&#xD;
return. She is affianced to me before high&#xD;
Heaven, and shall be so before men ere&#xD;
many days pass. Dare not to think of her,&#xD;
brother!'"&#xD;
Hernando turned pale as death, whilst&#xD;
Enrique said this. All the blood which had&#xD;
run to his head, streamed back to his heart.&#xD;
This lasted but a moment, the agony and&#xD;
suspense of which are indescribable: Then&#xD;
all the wild anger, the imperious and fiery&#xD;
nature of Hernando was capable of, arose&#xD;
in his breast. Then was, swept from * his&#xD;
mind, every thought but that a man, hsd&#xD;
stepped between him, and the first object of&#xD;
his passionate affection. Then vanished all&#xD;
but the maddening knowledge that a man&#xD;
had robbed him of the highest blessing of&#xD;
life; of a heart, for whose possession he&#xD;
would have sacrificed all and rejoiced. A&#xD;
child of the South, with wild passions like&#xD;
evil angels tugging at his heartstrings, with&#xD;
resistless anger and mighty love conquering&#xD;
and treading down reason, Hernando was&#xD;
for the time mad.&#xD;
He seized his brother at the girdle of his&#xD;
tunic, and his strength increased tenfold&#xD;
by passion, lifted him from the ground and&#xD;
carried him to the small balcony. Holding&#xD;
Enrique at arms' length, over the foaming&#xD;
billows, that far, far below, lashed the foot&#xD;

&#xD;
COUNTHRPLOTS.                      41&#xD;
of the cliff, he howled in a voice, almost in-&#xD;
articulate from passion:&#xD;
"Will you give up Rosa to me ?"&#xD;
" Never ! Consider, brother, that she loves&#xD;
me I Hernando, you mean me no, harm I"&#xD;
and Enrique tried  to grasp his brother's&#xD;
shoulder, while the cold sweat of agony&#xD;
and dread stood on his brow.&#xD;
"I will dash you to pieces onthe cliff&#xD;
below, if you do not consent I"&#xD;
" Brother I remember that one mother&#xD;
bore us!1 for her sake, hold 1"&#xD;
Hernando faltered.&#xD;
"For God's sake, brother I"&#xD;
"Will you give up Rosa?"&#xD;
Never I"&#xD;
Then die 1" and, with fearful energy,&#xD;
Hernando hurled his brbtber down into the&#xD;
deep and wild sea.&#xD;
And the sun looked from the lue sky,&#xD;
and the waters blazed like bek  of gold&#xD;
and fire, and the birds rose frft  their&#xD;
nests in the crevices of the cliff, and skim-&#xD;
med over the waves as the body of Enrique&#xD;
disappeared beneath the snowy foam.&#xD;

THE WRITING ON        THE DooR.&#xD;
Sunday morning dawned on the city of Lis-&#xD;
bon, and the first bells sent'their clear, ring.&#xD;
ing notes to the ears of the pious, as a sum-&#xD;
mons to rise, and not be too late at church,&#xD;
when Pater Sylvester, the sacristan of the&#xD;
cathedral, opened his eyes.&#xD;
The first object that presented itself tohis&#xD;
sleepy glanee, was a woman standing at his&#xD;
bedside, with her tongue busily engaged&#xD;
in discharging scolding terms at his devoted&#xD;
head. She was about the middle age, fat,&#xD;
but hard featured, and dressed in a flashy,&#xD;
slattern style. The worthy sacristan made&#xD;
several conciliatory motions with his head&#xD;
and short flabby hands, at the same time&#xD;
pronouncing a few Latin benedictions, (his&#xD;
stock in trade,) to allay the wrath of the fe-&#xD;
male scolder. But the dame was not to be&#xD;
pacified so easily. Nothing would content&#xD;
her, but that the drowsy priest should risa.&#xD;
Would be deprive Christians of their chance&#xD;
of salvation, by opening church too .late ?&#xD;
Would he lose his situation? Would he dio-&#xD;

morning. Every where crosses, madonnas&#xD;
and saints were repeated in themost various&#xD;
forms, with the richest materials.&#xD;
Now the organ lifted its mighty voice, and&#xD;
in' waves of harmony coated through the&#xD;
longnaisles. Mass was performed. The pa-&#xD;
pal nuntius, Cardinal Georgio, in his mag-&#xD;
nifient robes, led the service and preached&#xD;
the sermon.&#xD;
And with burning words, alluding to the&#xD;
scrolls fastened to the churches, he inflamed&#xD;
still inore the wrath of the populace. When&#xD;
the serviee was concluded, and the high&#xD;
dignitaries of the church had retired, the&#xD;
congregation left the church to wait before&#xD;
the doors for the sacristan.&#xD;
As he issued forth, with the scroll in his&#xD;
hand, to return home, they told him of their&#xD;
determination-to bring the matter before the&#xD;
4-king immediately. They wished him tb be&#xD;
their spokesman, well convinced that his&#xD;
learning and sanctity fitted him to be so.&#xD;
With some reluctance, the worthy pater&#xD;
allowed them to place himon the shoulders&#xD;
of a couple of strong mechanics. Thus,&#xD;
mounted in the midst of the still increasing&#xD;
crowd, pater Sylvester was borne to the roy-&#xD;
al palace.&#xD;
The king entered into thespirit of the&#xD;
multitude, and received the scroll brought&#xD;
by pater Sylvester. Don Antonio, the min-&#xD;
istir, appeared on the balcony and assured&#xD;
the people, that his majesty would endeavor&#xD;
by every means to discover the perpetrator&#xD;
of this sacrilege. .  -        P      Id&#xD;
For this purpose, Juan sent the same day&#xD;
ten thousand gold pieces to Luke Giraldo,&#xD;
one of the most prominent merchants of&#xD;
Lisbon, to be paid to the man who would&#xD;
discover or lead, to the discovery of the&#xD;
writer.&#xD;
Ris eminence the Cardinal Georgio, nun-&#xD;
tius of the pope, added five thousand gold&#xD;
pieces more, to those already deposited by&#xD;
the king.&#xD;
Public criers proclaimed in every street,&#xD;
that Master Luke Giraldo had orders to pay&#xD;
fifteen thousand gold pieces, to the man who&#xD;
discovered the wretch that had dared to&#xD;
write the words, and to affix the scrolls to&#xD;
the door of the churches.       i&#xD;
&#xD;
COUNTER'PLOTS.                      43&#xD;
The king was'furious. Two sue acts,.as&#xD;
the murder of Firma Fida and the writing&#xD;
on the church doors, occurring within a&#xD;
short time of each other, in bold defiance as&#xD;
it were, of his authority, showed him that&#xD;
there must exist in Portugal a power oppo-&#xD;
sed either to the church or the government.&#xD;
He consulted with Don Antonio. The min-&#xD;
ister's opinion not only coincided with that&#xD;
of the king, but he also assured Juan that&#xD;
this power must be strong, very strong, thus&#xD;
openly and boldly to defy the royal authori-&#xD;
ty. Still there was no evidence of dissatis-&#xD;
faction among the nobles, or among the&#xD;
people. Who would conspire against the&#xD;
king? None but the Prior de CastroI' And&#xD;
who would conspire against the church?&#xD;
none but the New Christians, that still were&#xD;
Israelites in secret ! Then the, king and&#xD;
his minister came to the conclusion that the&#xD;
Inquisition would be the most effectual,&#xD;
means to control both these powers, awl the&#xD;
king ordered Dop Antonio to prepare a let-&#xD;
ter for his signature, requesting his holiness&#xD;
to appoint officers of the Inquisition in Por-&#xD;
tugal. . Meanwhile every endeavor was&#xD;
made to discover the guilty ones. Let us&#xD;
see what the people said on the subject.&#xD;
A knot of men were sitting in front of a&#xD;
tavern, that looked upon the Tagus. - They&#xD;
conversed upon the scrolls on the church&#xD;
doors.&#xD;
" It will go hard with him, who did this!"&#xD;
said a sailor whose sunburnt sallowness of&#xD;
skin showed that he had been in India.&#xD;
"le will but get his deserts, and Lisbon&#xD;
will have a holiday. Oh it is a fine show to&#xD;
see a man burnt," said the host, a fat chub-&#xD;
by little man.&#xD;
"Have you ever seen it ?" inquired the&#xD;
sailor.&#xD;
" When quite a child; but since then I&#xD;
have seen a man torn to pieces by wild&#xD;
horses, which is also a spectacle not to be&#xD;
despised."&#xD;
" You should be in Spain then," cried a&#xD;
meagre lantern jawed Spaniard, who re-&#xD;
galed himself with bread and onions. "I&#xD;
have seen numbers burned; and such mag-&#xD;

We turn to an assembly of Israelites tha&#xD;
had been hastily convened in the basemen&#xD;
room of the inn of St. Ignatius. Their&#xD;
countenances were troubled; alarm and fea&#xD;
-were evidentin the hasty questions and&#xD;
short replies. Don Lionel Dian was absent.&#xD;
An old noble of great learning presided.&#xD;
The general question was: who had done&#xD;
this ? Was it a secretIsraelite?&#xD;
The general answer could be no'other&#xD;
than, it was: for who else, in Lisbon be-&#xD;
lieves not inChrist?&#xD;
While the meeting was thus agitated and&#xD;
swayed by fears and doubts, a young man&#xD;
entered, and stepping up to the platform on&#xD;
which the chairman was seated, requested&#xD;
permission to address the assetably.  The&#xD;
chairman raised his hand, all were silent.&#xD;
When   the  young man -looked.,around,&#xD;
with astonishment all present recognised in&#xD;
'the pale haggard features, the sunken eyes,&#xD;
the brow hung over with wild mottled hair,&#xD;
and the bent form, the ere brilliant and&#xD;
handsome Hernando da Costa!&#xD;
" I have written upon the doors of the'&#xD;
churches the words which so excite the -rage&#xD;
of the people,and your alarm I 1 have,in the&#xD;
face of Chistianity proclaimed the truth -of&#xD;

idolatrous nation the false maxixAs they bow&#xD;

for it. Be under no apprehensions,-breth-&#xD;
-'ren in faith-I will deliver myself up to the&#xD;
king's justice! for Hernando da Costa has&#xD;
nothing left but death!"&#xD;
At first the assembly had listened with an-&#xD;
ger, for this dangerous and useless procla-&#xD;
mation of Jewish principles had needlessly&#xD;
re-awakened the old hate of the Portuguese&#xD;
nation against the Israelites. But gradual.&#xD;
ly a deep sentiment of pity prevailed.&#xD;
&#xD;
o  The young man seemed to labor under&#xD;
such a load of misery; his physical beauty&#xD;
r was broken; his mind evidently distracted;&#xD;
e and his actions. and demeanor wild. His&#xD;
y dress was in the greatest disorder, and his&#xD;
beautiful hair hung in tangled locks around&#xD;
e his head.&#xD;
e   "But my son," said the venerable chair-&#xD;
o man," know ye not that, by this action, you&#xD;
have excited the wild rage of a peoplethat&#xD;

Israelitesl they have done this!" said a&#xD;
stout middle aged' man, a merchant wl-o&#xD;
trembled for his magazines" filled with rich&#xD;
wares.&#xD;
" What Will become of us, it the Inquisi-&#xD;
tion be established," cried two men, in the&#xD;
garb of inks:&#xD;
Each ode b6gan to represent 'and bewail&#xD;
the peculiar danger which Would threaten&#xD;
him 'and his possessions, if it werd diseover-&#xD;
ed that the pretended New Christians hd&#xD;
relapsed into their old religion. None pro-&#xD;
posed any plan of action. It was clear that&#xD;
the leading spirit, Don Lionel Dian was ab.&#xD;
sent&#xD;
After all had finished their descriptions of&#xD;
a danger, of whose greatness they were con-&#xD;
vinced befoi'ehand, their eyes fell again on&#xD;
Hernando, and their thoughts reverted to&#xD;
delivering "him  to the king as the only&#xD;
chance of safety.&#xD;
But the oldnoble who presided could not&#xD;
b3ar this thought. He arose and said&#xD;
'"Neve'let as be bead enough to throw a&#xD;
fellow inan a'.nd brother into the jaws of&#xD;
death, for what -we know to be no crihn, but&#xD;
even act of vitue. Let us rather atteiapt&#xD;
to avert public wrath, and direct it into&#xD;
another channel, by affixing to the church&#xD;
ddors a second proclamation, which shall&#xD;

lead all to think, that an Englishman and&#xD;
Protestant wrote the first. Thus we will&#xD;
be saved."&#xD;
No; one else had any other plan to offer&#xD;
land, therefore, the proposition of the old no-&#xD;
ble was adopted. Still it seemed to many&#xD;
but a trivial measure to allay public wrath.&#xD;
The materials for writing were brought, and&#xD;
Hernando had to sit down and write upon&#xD;
large sheets: ,&#xD;
"1 am no Spaniard and no Portuguese,l&#xD;
but-an Englishman; I am a stranger and so-&#xD;
journer among you. But if you spend hun-&#xD;
dreds of thousands you shall not learn my&#xD;
name."     I&#xD;
Hernando did all this in a listless manner,&#xD;
like one who, as it were, had no spirit, no&#xD;
mind' no will to move or act himself, and&#xD;
was impelled and moved by others. With&#xD;
the greatestastonishment all saw this change&#xD;
in him, the reason of which none suspec-&#xD;
ted.&#xD;
Let us retrace our steps and follow him&#xD;
from the moment when mad with love, rage&#xD;
and despair, he threw his brother Ernrique&#xD;
from the balcony of castle Salonga.&#xD;
After, in a moment of wild madness, when&#xD;
reason, reflection, and even consciousness&#xD;
was absent, Hernando had committed frat-&#xD;
ricide, the reaction of his feelings was as&#xD;
sudden as it was violent. The fraction of a&#xD;
moment after he had unclasped his hand&#xD;
from his brother's girdle, he would have'&#xD;
givenhis life and soul,-heaven and earth, to&#xD;
have it once more in his power to undo the&#xD;
horrible deed, to save Enrique. With the&#xD;
quickness of thought all the better parts of&#xD;
his being, fraternal affection, reason, and&#xD;
kindness of heart returned to him, and like&#xD;
the lightnings lash in a dark night,.served&#xD;
only now to show his forlorn, lost and damn-&#xD;
ed condition to his mind's eye.&#xD;
And it is always thus. When the evil&#xD;
spirit, offspring of our own untamed passions&#xD;
and undicipliged mind, has darkened our&#xD;
.,eyes, and led dsto steps beyondredemption,&#xD;
has plunged us into the deep, deep abyss of&#xD;
sin; from whose mire a whole lifetime of&#xD;
excellence can not cleanse the soul, he takes&#xD;
away the blindness, and with tenfold light&#xD;
illuminesihe depth to which we have sunk,&#xD;
&#xD;
AL SEonnT,&#xD;
&#xD;
and the heights we can never hope to climb&#xD;
again.&#xD;
The terrible deed,and indirect consequence&#xD;
of his love for Rosa, wiped away all the&#xD;
brightness and fire of that love, and left it a&#xD;
burning sore in the heart of Hernando. Let&#xD;
not the reader understand that now he loved&#xD;
Rosa less. Far from it.- But every thought&#xD;
of that beauteous lady was' attended with&#xD;
agonizing remorse, with terrible pain, and&#xD;
with a dreadful conviction that his, 'oyna&#xD;
doing now separated him more from her,&#xD;
than when the bright form of Enrique stood&#xD;
between them.&#xD;
The excitement and consequent reactida&#xD;
of his feelings, seemed to have prostrated&#xD;
his mind and soul. He was in a kind-of&#xD;
stupor most of the time, only broken here&#xD;
and there by flashes of a transient wildness.&#xD;
In oneof these intervals he fled from castle&#xD;
Salonga to Lisbon. His family alarmed by&#xD;
his looks, and behavior would send for a&#xD;
physician. - But Hernando looked the doors&#xD;
of his apartments and would admit none.&#xD;
In another fit of wildness, he had written&#xD;
that bold declaration, and affixed the scrolls&#xD;
to the church doors.&#xD;
We have seen that he freely offered to de-&#xD;
liver himself up. Indeed he would have&#xD;
considered it a blessing, to be allowed to&#xD;
steep his heart in the water of teath. For&#xD;
he was tired of life and the sore pain in his&#xD;
breast. Yet death alone would not satisfy&#xD;
him. With severe justice he wished to die&#xD;
in the most painful way as a partial pun-&#xD;
ishment for his crime, and to appease the&#xD;
angry spiritof Enrique, which he imagined&#xD;
to attend him constantly. To appease the&#xD;
wrath of God, he intended to maintain his&#xD;
creed and principles in the face of the world.&#xD;
Thus, vain man, he tried to lay life which&#xD;
was painful and burthensome to him, an ap-&#xD;
peasing sacrifice at the altar of God, and the&#xD;
tomb of his brotherI And thus it is with&#xD;
all of us.&#xD;
We know that justice is preferable to in-&#xD;
justice. Every one feels intuitively what&#xD;
is just and unjust, which from this point of&#xD;
view.are but other names, for good and bad&#xD;
and, therefore, whenever we have wronged&#xD;
justice, we feel a criminal consciousess of&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I-&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, PLoTs AD&#xD;
&#xD;
it, and then try to sooth ourselves, by bring.&#xD;
ing a sacrifice to justice. Still even then our&#xD;
selfishness -lets us sacrifice things, become&#xD;
useless to us by the very injustice commit-&#xD;
ted.&#xD;
On the Monday following the day when&#xD;
the scrolls had been found on the churches,&#xD;
Lisbon vyas astonished by other scrolls&#xD;
being attached to the same places, with the&#xD;
words:&#xD;
"I am no Spaniard or Portuguese; but a&#xD;
stranger and sojourner among you. Yet if&#xD;
you offer hundreds of thousands you shall&#xD;
not discover my name."'&#xD;
1ut the effect was different from what was&#xD;
expected. The people, and the priests who&#xD;
preached 'to them, said: "This is a trap to&#xD;
mislead us. An Englishman and heretic,&#xD;
although he believes in Luther, does not de.&#xD;
ny Christ. None but a Jew could have&#xD;
written those words, " and the inquiry was&#xD;
diligently continued.&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
D O N N A GLORIA AND THE PRIEST.&#xD;
Father Marcus again waited on the Coun-&#xD;
tems de Voga. She received him graciously,&#xD;
and, when the servants had left the room,&#xD;
inquired:&#xD;
"Have you been able to read the docu-&#xD;
ments ?"&#xD;
"I have; if your excellency will wait but&#xD;
till [ can take them from the pocket of my&#xD;
gown, 1 will read to you, their contents."&#xD;
"Be quick father, for I am very impatient.&#xD;
Are their contents of interest to me ?",&#xD;
'"I can not say how far they may interest&#xD;
your excellency, " replied the priest, search-&#xD;
ing and fumbling in his voluminous pockets.&#xD;
"Now, God help you, if you have lost&#xD;
them I" cried Gloria, giving way to her im&#xD;
patience.&#xD;
"Here they are, " replied father Marcus,&#xD;
c]mly, producing the articles in question.&#xD;
"Now read them," cried the countess,&#xD;
leaning forward eagerly; and in her eager-&#xD;
ness almost grasping the priest's arms.&#xD;
Farther Marcus began.&#xD;
Not to weary our readers with a tedious&#xD;
tra-aslation of the documents, we will briefly&#xD;
acquaint them with their substance.&#xD;
&#xD;
COUNTEIPLOTS.                       4T&#xD;
The firbt-was an agreement of the Duke di&#xD;
Asambuja's to secure to the Prior di Castro&#xD;
the adherence of the nobles of the council,and&#xD;
'of the leaders of the Cortes, on his royal ex-&#xD;
cellency, the Prior di Castro, being able to&#xD;
prove, by well attested documents the mar-&#xD;
riage of his mother, to his majesty Emanuel&#xD;
the Great. Also to prove, by certificates of'&#xD;
baptism, his birth to have*occurred before&#xD;
that ofJuan IlI, the present occupant of the&#xD;
throne.&#xD;
The second document contained a promise&#xD;
of Don Diego di Azambuja, to bring one&#xD;
thousand men, of well trained troops, to&#xD;
Lisbon, whenever a written command of his&#xD;
excellency the Prior, countersigned by the&#xD;
Duke di Azambuja, was sent to him.&#xD;
The third was a sanction of the prior's&#xD;
claims, by his eminence the Cardinal Geor-&#xD;
gio.&#xD;
The fourth was the plan of a new Con-&#xD;
stitution.&#xD;
"This document,". said father Marcusto&#xD;
Gloria, "I will restore to his eminence;"&#xD;
and he put the Cardinal's sanction againinto&#xD;
his pocket.&#xD;
Gloria was satisfied. Now, a glorious&#xD;
view of revenge opened before her mind's&#xD;
eye. Don Diego was her's! her's entirely!&#xD;
what more could she wish to accomplish!&#xD;
She had his life in her handI She could&#xD;
crush himI and crush him she would. She&#xD;
would break the pride which made her a&#xD;
nunI She would revenge the years passed in&#xD;
the convent! Her blood rushed to her&#xD;
head, and scarcely could she command her-&#xD;
self to listen, to what the priest said.&#xD;
" Here !" and he showed her a small pa-&#xD;
per, " here is a letter which I found amongst&#xD;
the documents; it makes mention of a gen-&#xD;
eral meeting to be held in two days. The&#xD;
place of meeting, the required signs for ad-&#xD;
mission, the disguises are all so described,&#xD;
that, if you permit me, I will attend the&#xD;
meeting myself, to convince my own eyes of&#xD;
the truth of these statements. You, as a&#xD;
friend of the present king, certainly wish to&#xD;
explode this conspiracy, and punish the&#xD;
traitors?"&#xD;
"Certainly. And, priest, I will even ac-&#xD;
company you there."&#xD;

"You, lady !" exclaimed the astonished&#xD;
secretary.&#xD;
"But consider, the impropriety I"&#xD;
"1 will gothere!"&#xD;
"Consider, the danger, lady I"&#xD;
"Have you heard 'me? 1 will go there!&#xD;
bring the necessary disguises, at the tinie,&#xD;

Father Marcus bowed.&#xD;

TILE CONSPIRATORS.&#xD;
4, the appointed time the priest attended&#xD;
Glori.6. He brought two gowns, such as the&#xD;
inferior monks were used to.wear. To the&#xD;
bosom of each was fastened a cross of white&#xD;
cloth.. The.cowls, that were attached to the&#xD;
upper part of the gowns, were large and&#xD;
he vy,&#xD;
This, then, is the disguise we must as-&#xD;
s"e e?",asked Gloria.&#xD;
"It is, lady; are you yet determined to.&#xD;
go,?"&#xD;
$I I never give up my purpose."&#xD;
"Tu God's name, then."&#xD;
Father MarpAs wore an uncommonly se-&#xD;
rious depression, even for him, this evening.&#xD;
Perhaps he repented of having projected&#xD;
this dangerous errand..&#xD;
"Be py chambermaid, for once, father,&#xD;
and, help me on with this cassock I" cried&#xD;
Gloria gaily. -&#xD;
The priest did as he was bid. Gloria fas-&#xD;
tened the cord around her waist, and drew&#xD;
the ugly qowl over her head; none would&#xD;
have recognised her. She seemed one of the&#xD;
tall poor monks, that throng the streets of&#xD;
Lisbon to beg, or collect money for charita-&#xD;
ble purposes.,.I&#xD;
The private secretary covered his simple,&#xD;
but Ane black garb with the other monk's&#xD;
habit. They were ready to go.        .&#xD;
"Where is the place of meeting ?" inquir-&#xD;
ed Gloria, as she east a last glance. into the&#xD;
mirror, and smiled at the complete meta-&#xD;
morphosis of her figure.&#xD;
"In a private chapel, hard by," replied&#xD;
father Marcus.&#xD;
"Let us go then," replied Gloria, opening&#xD;
&#xD;
a secret door which by a winding staircase,&#xD;
led to the rear of the pavilion. , : .&#xD;
"One thing I must communicate to your&#xD;
ladyship, ere we start," said the priest has-&#xD;
Gloria turned.&#xD;
"The sign on entering is to raisetlehand,&#xD;
with all the fingers closed, but the first and,&#xD;
the last. A watchword was also alluded to,&#xD;
but not mentioned. If a watchword is ne-&#xD;
cessary we will have to listen, for what those&#xD;
preceding us pronounce."&#xD;
"Very well," replied the lady, and both&#xD;
were about to descend by the secret stair-&#xD;
case, when an opposite door opened, sad&#xD;
Maria Flunoz, entered, Seeing the two&#xD;
priests, she said in great astonishmePt. ,"'I&#xD;
thought rsy lady were here I" The.apart,&#xD;
ment ,hey were in, was the last but one of&#xD;
that suite.-.&#xD;
Gloria knew that her chambermaid would&#xD;
enter the next and last, to look for her. On&#xD;
not finding her, she would be alarmed.-&#xD;
Therefore, the lady said, in a voice as deep,&#xD;
as possible:&#xD;
" What have you to say to your mistress,&#xD;
girl? I am going in to hea her confession,&#xD;
and you must not disturb us."&#xD;
" Nothing, holy father; but that the page,&#xD;
Fidaro, has a message for her from,. Mas-&#xD;
sor."'&#xD;
Gloria entered the next apartment, saying:&#xD;
"Wait a moment," and presently she re-&#xD;
turned without her disguise.&#xD;
"Father," she said to the priest, "enter,&#xD;
for a few moments, this apartment," and she&#xD;
pointed to the one she had just left.&#xD;
" And you, Maria, bring the page bet'e."&#xD;
In a few moments, Fidaro stood before the&#xD;
Countess; the chambermaid retired. The&#xD;
page threw burning looks-upon the beauti-&#xD;
ful lady, and throwing himself upon one&#xD;
knee seized her hand and seemed to devour&#xD;
it, with a kiss.I&#xD;
" Rise, Fidaro!l this is not seemly," cried&#xD;
Gloria .slightly blushing, but smiling upon.&#xD;
him with her velvetty eyes.&#xD;
The page arose.&#xD;
"What have you got for me, from Mas-&#xD;
sor?" inquired Gloria.&#xD;
'' " This letter,lady; he is about to return to&#xD;
the vicinity of Lisbon from the North."&#xD;

Gloria tore the thread that tied the epistli&#xD;
and inquired:&#xD;
" Can Massor write? 't is a great accom&#xD;
plishment for the gipsy chief!"     -&#xD;
The letter contained these words:&#xD;
"To morrow night, I will be with you&#xD;
when the clock strikes twelve. I then -will&#xD;
for the first time, avail myself of your pro&#xD;
mises, and prefer a request. Be ready.&#xD;
MAsson.&#xD;
"Do you know what he will require ?"&#xD;
I can not even imagine."&#xD;
"Have you any other message, Fidaro ?&#xD;
"ot for you, lady."&#xD;
For whom else; you have no secrets be.&#xD;
fore me, GIhopo &#xD;
"Oh yes! my God, I have a great secret,&#xD;
which I shall not dare to tell you," and the&#xD;
page sighed deeply and cast imploring looks&#xD;
at the Countess.'&#xD;
"Secrets of the soul are best kept within&#xD;
one's own heart, where they sing -beautiful&#xD;
songs, and weave golden hopes. When they&#xD;
are once let free, they leave us, and the torn&#xD;
remains of golden hopes, the sad memories&#xD;
of beautiful songs are all that remain."&#xD;
" But one heart is too small to contain&#xD;
this secret."&#xD;
." Let us talk of other things," cried Glo-&#xD;
ria, alarmed at the-turn the conversation had&#xD;
taken: "let us talk of your message. To&#xD;
whom is it?"&#xD;
" To his excellency, the Prior di Castro,&#xD;
and to Don Diego di Azambuja, my young&#xD;
master-"&#xD;
"What are you to say to them ?"&#xD;
"I wm to give them these two letters," and&#xD;
he showed to Gloria two epistles.&#xD;
"Did Massor bid you do anything else?"&#xD;
"To report to him all that passed at a cer-&#xD;
tam meeting to be held this evening." ,&#xD;
"Excellentl" cried Gloria. "Quicktell me&#xD;
the password which is needed for admission;&#xD;
for I am also going there."&#xD;
"You!" cried the page.&#xD;
"Certainly; I have already a cassock&#xD;
with a white cross, and know the sign of rai-&#xD;

"God and the rightful heir !"&#xD;

to gain entrance ?"&#xD;
"One thing more, lady, and this will prove&#xD;
an insurmountable obstacle to you.. The&#xD;
, name of the person must be given, who en-&#xD;
ters."&#xD;
"The name of the person. Pshaw!" the&#xD;
&#xD;
lady considered for a moment, and-thea said:&#xD;
"Fidaro, do you know of any-one that will&#xD;
remain absent ?"&#xD;
"I know of none; and even if one stays&#xD;
away, his friend will state the reason of his&#xD;
absence and excuse it to the others."&#xD;
"A bright thought! Fidaro,doyou assume&#xD;
a monk's habit, when you go there?"&#xD;
"Yes, lady. All there wear the gown and&#xD;
cowl."&#xD;
"Then let mego there in your place."&#xD;
"Impossible, lady I" cried Fidaro.&#xD;
" Nothing is impossible; give me the let-&#xD;
ters, that I may deliver them there," said&#xD;
Gloria.&#xD;
"But if you should be discovered ?"&#xD;
I will not be discovered. Hasten,Fidaro,&#xD;
and give me the letters."&#xD;
" Oh lady, do not go! Will faithfully re-&#xD;
port to you every circumstance that happens&#xD;
there; do not go !" cried Fidaro.&#xD;
"I must go; that is enough. Give me the&#xD;
letters."&#xD;
Fidaro handed them to her.&#xD;
" Is anything further necessary to be&#xD;
said, on delivery of these letters ?"&#xD;
" Nothing, but that Massor will be in Lis-&#xD;
bon, tomorrow night, and see the Prior and&#xD;
Don Diego himself."&#xD;
"Very -well. Await my return here;"&#xD;
andGloria re-assumed the monk's habit with&#xD;
the white cross, called fatherMarcus, and&#xD;
disappeared with him behind the doorof the&#xD;
secret staircase; Fidazo was left alone.&#xD;
They passed out of the pavilion. Donna&#xD;
Gloria, ignorant of the streets of Lisbon,,al-&#xD;
lowed herself to be guided by father Mar-&#xD;
cus. While they were walking along a solii&#xD;
tary lane in the rear of the park, she related&#xD;
to the secretary, what Fidaro had told her&#xD;
concerning the necessity of giving the name&#xD;
to gain entrance.&#xD;

the duke, and then turned to where Don Die-&#xD;

,He was completely wrapped up in his&#xD;
disguise.&#xD;
Stepping up to him, Gloria said:&#xD;
' Aletter from  Massor, my lord I" and&#xD;
held It out to him.&#xD;
As he turned, his cowl was thrown back&#xD;
partially, and Gloria could see his face.-&#xD;
She - trembled violently on recognising her&#xD;
loverr,-      .  11&#xD;
"You tremble, boy ?" asked Don Diego&#xD;
in the old musical voice.&#xD;
4'It is the first time that I have attended&#xD;
such an assembly," replied Gloria, in a very&#xD;
low tone.&#xD;
"Be not frightened; stand behind me un-&#xD;
til this is over; you are my father'3 page ?"&#xD;
-"Iam; my name is Fidaro!"&#xD;
-At Well, Fidaro, when did the gipsy chief&#xD;
give thee this ?"&#xD;
"Day before yesterday; I found'him near&#xD;
Coimbra."     -&#xD;
"Coimbra?" and Don Diego sighed.&#xD;
.Gloria had placed herself, behind tse&#xD;
young nobleman. That sigh! Like the loves&#xD;
from the seafoam, so new hopes and joys&#xD;
appeared from.the depth of Donna Gloria's&#xD;
heart at that sigh. Was it breathed to the&#xD;
memory of that early love ? Was it a tribute&#xD;
to the recollection of her?&#xD;
She stood behindDon Diego, and dream-&#xD;
ed, and hoped, and hated, and trembled, and&#xD;
gnashed her teeth, as various emotions rol-&#xD;
led through her soul.- Men spoke, and ar-,&#xD;
gued, and proposed,and accepted-she heard&#xD;
nothing saw nothing but the form enveloped&#xD;
in the dark -monk's habit, that sat before&#xD;
her. And her dream was suddenly broken&#xD;
in upon, by the obnelusion of the meeting,&#xD;
and the departure of those present,.&#xD;
We, however, who are perhaps interested&#xD;
in the events of this meeting, will briefly re-&#xD;
capitulate what passed there.&#xD;
The Prior di Castro was greatly embar-&#xD;
rassed. He had promised to exhibit the&#xD;
proofs of his right to the nobles, that had&#xD;
assembled, and but a short time ago dis-&#xD;
&#xD;
AL SoRET,&#xD;
&#xD;
covered that the casket containing those&#xD;
proofs, had been stolen from his private&#xD;
closet. He was, therefore, forced to prevari-&#xD;
cate and satisfy the nobles with the word of&#xD;
the duke di Azambuja who had seen those&#xD;
proofs. The nobles were bid, meanwhile to&#xD;
prepare and muster their followers, and,&#xD;
gradually draw them to Lisbon.&#xD;
Don Diego had promised to bring a thou-&#xD;
sand men, to forward the scheme.&#xD;
The gipsy chief had promised to bring&#xD;
five hundred stout fellows, well armed, and&#xD;
twenty thousand gold pieces.&#xD;
The other nobles all named the number&#xD;
of men, and the money they could furnish.&#xD;
Each hesitated not to makeremarks about&#xD;
the reward of their services,&#xD;
His excellency, the Prior, promised to&#xD;
take their request into consideration.,&#xD;
The duke di Azambuja was to be prime&#xD;
minister; Don Diego to be commander in&#xD;
chief of the army. The gipsy chief had pre-&#xD;
ferred, in his letter, a singular request.&#xD;
" Religious liberty I" Moors, Roman Cath-&#xD;
olics, Israelites, all he wished to be put upon&#xD;
an equal level, in a social and legal point of&#xD;
view. The assembly was paralysed with&#xD;
astonishment. The Cardinal was the first to&#xD;
declaim against this. Others followed. The&#xD;
Prior was forced, to rise and promise to ac-&#xD;
cept on those conditions nothing from Massor.&#xD;
Another meeting was to be held a week&#xD;
from that day in the same chapel, and&#xD;
which was to be attended by many of the&#xD;
Cortes.&#xD;
Then  the conspirators adjourned and&#xD;
dispersed. Don Diego arose and said to&#xD;
Gloria:&#xD;
" Follow me home;- I wish to put off this&#xD;
disguise, and then we will proceed upon&#xD;
another errand."&#xD;
Gloria bowed, and followed Don Diego&#xD;
into the palace di Azambuja.&#xD;
"Lay aside your cowl, and wait for me&#xD;
below," said Don Diego, entering his apart-&#xD;
ments.&#xD;
The embarrasing situation of Donna Glo-&#xD;
ria increased every moment. The pages and&#xD;
servants, that filled the palace of the proud&#xD;
duke, looked half inquiringly, and half sus-&#xD;
piciously at her.&#xD;

On, PLOTS A&#xD;
&#xD;
-The door of Don Diego's- dressing roost&#xD;
again opened, and his own servant, or as h4&#xD;
now would be styled, valet de chambre&#xD;
came out, and giving ablack mask toGloria&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Go Fidaro; change your dress, and keel&#xD;
this mask in your pouch; then await Doi&#xD;
Diego, at the palace gate."&#xD;
A dark-eyed youth that stood by, laughed&#xD;
and whispered to Gloria, thinking that i&#xD;
was his friend Fidaro:&#xD;
"What mad adventure took Don Diego&#xD;
outto night? Has he a desire for the hear&#xD;
of some fair nun, that he assumes a monk's&#xD;
garb ?"&#xD;
"Silence," whispered Gloria; "come with&#xD;
me-to my room, and help me take this cowl&#xD;
off, for as you hear, he is going out again,&#xD;
and I'must accompany him."&#xD;
" You speak in such a strange manner&#xD;
to night, Fidaro," observed the youth; "Ho,&#xD;
there I give me a torch," he called to some&#xD;
servants.&#xD;
"No, no; " cried Gloria; "I can change&#xD;
my dress in the dark."     -&#xD;
And she drew the .youth's arm, through&#xD;
her's. Thus she was led to Fidato's cham-&#xD;
ber without discovery. Chance which had&#xD;
favored her thus far, deserted her not now.&#xD;
The room was dark, very dark.&#xD;
" Hand me some of my clothes, while I&#xD;
strip, this gown off, " she said, in a low&#xD;
whisper.&#xD;
"1I will; but when you return, tell me all&#xD;
about the adventure."&#xD;
Gloria tore off the gown, aud hastily strip-&#xD;
ped'herself of dressea and skirts.&#xD;
"1 can not find any thing, without a light,'&#xD;
'tis so very dart here," said the youth.&#xD;
"Then go and get a light, but quickly,"&#xD;
replied Gloria.&#xD;
The youth left the apartment&#xD;
In a moment Gloria had ascertained&#xD;
everything that was in the chamber, by feel-&#xD;
ing. She ran against an open chest. With&#xD;
a quickness only possessed in ruch cases,&#xD;
and which at other times it seems as impo.&#xD;
sible to imitate, as it is for a strong, healthy&#xD;
man to assume the strength and power of&#xD;
delirium or madness, she had drawn from it&#xD;
hose, tunic, and cloak, and slipped into&#xD;

i, the hat -was drawn ddeply over her face.&#xD;
The bodts also were put on.&#xD;
p   Then she heard the steps of the young&#xD;
n man bringing the light.&#xD;
With a spring she reached the place where&#xD;
I her dresseshad been thrown,seized themiand&#xD;
t forced them intothe chest, from whence she&#xD;
had taken.the hose, tpnic and cloak.-&#xD;
The light' already shone through . the&#xD;
t slightly oped doory'whea Gloria shuttle lid&#xD;
. of the chest. As-she tied the strings of her&#xD;
mask, the youth' entered with torch.&#xD;
" Why Fidro" he ex6laimed, "you have&#xD;
taken Amaso'b clothes.: What will he say ?"&#xD;
"So I have,", eriedGlotia. "But it was so&#xD;
dark; and now I have no time to chage&#xD;
them."&#xD;
" Well, he will not perceive i. -RHe will&#xD;
sleep already - when you return, and.-then&#xD;
you can replace them in his box."&#xD;
. - "What is that? "-eontinued the youth,&#xD;
picking up a splendid ring, that had dropped&#xD;
from GloriIa's hand..     .&#xD;
" For God's sake be quiet. I must hurry&#xD;
down to accompady .Don Diego., When I&#xD;
come back,.I'll tell you."&#xD;
" Very well, take it."&#xD;
Donna Gloria not hearing to expose her&#xD;
hand said:&#xD;
-',Keep ittill I return," and hurried down&#xD;
the long corridor, dotvn the -staircases, and&#xD;
with bended head, stopped at the gate,where&#xD;
she was presently joined by.Don Diego.  .&#xD;
" I need not tell you, that whda you see,&#xD;
and wherever yo: accompany msmust , be&#xD;
forgotten by .tomorrow's light. My father&#xD;
has told me that yoh were intelligent and&#xD;

young noble walked rapidly down the silent&#xD;
and deserted street,closely followedby the&#xD;
disguised Gloria.&#xD;
CHAPTER, XIV.:&#xD;
TH     HOLY   tal5Irs     .N.&#xD;
A crowd of idlers lounged around the gates&#xD;
of a stately palace, not far from thePraadi&#xD;

THa FATAL Scae,&#xD;
&#xD;
the hardened heaps' of' mud, that~arose at&#xD;
intervals in, the midst of the street.- Others&#xD;
lay upon the ground'beneath the shadows of&#xD;
thehouses, in the listidas attitude of Italian&#xD;
loafers. Some talked and argued. Others&#xD;
stared dreatmingly at the-blue-sky. Some&#xD;
seemed to wait with -curiosity for the&#xD;
oeedrrence-of something within the palace,&#xD;
or theiseuing of -some, one from the gates.&#xD;
Othersiwith indolent' indifference, slumber-&#xD;
ed. In short, idle people had come to see'&#xD;
the great Catdinal Savelli, and his renowned&#xD;
seeretary Domingo; a Jesuit. Both had but&#xD;
recently= arrived' from Rome, with a Papal&#xD;
bull, aidletters from" the' Emperor Charles&#xD;
V. ::The papal bull established the Inquisi-&#xD;
tion in Portugal, and appointed Cardihal Sa-&#xD;
velli its head,'and legate of the Holy See.&#xD;
Hiseminence 'had been summoned to the&#xD;
council. For the matters to be discussed&#xD;
there partook much of the 'eclesiastic. Peo.&#xD;
ple had-not'yet' seen the Cardinal Savelli.&#xD;
It was for .this reasn, And to receive the&#xD;
blessing' of 'a holypriest just arrived from&#xD;
Rome,(then the prime factory of salvation,)&#xD;
that around his palace had assembled a Lis.&#xD;
bon drowd'&#xD;
That is to ssy, a-crowd, enthusiastic- and&#xD;
easily excited, but the moment after: again&#xD;
relapsinginto languid indolende. A' towd&#xD;
alite toll show and splendor, but dead to&#xD;
everything thatdid not amuse orezeite theni-&#xD;
The sun shone as a Portugaese sun is -wont&#xD;
toshine inaimmer. 'The Tages blazed with&#xD;
the releetion of intense light like white hot&#xD;
brass The sky hung like a shady blue&#xD;
dome; far above the city.&#xD;
The-gates of the palace were thrown&#xD;
open  F'oim thd ample entry rode three&#xD;
Jesuit priests, onsleek well fed mules, Then&#xD;
followed six servants in black, riding in cou-&#xD;
pINs. '&#xD;
'Their countewances' looked severe- from&#xD;
under the broad black band of their caps.&#xD;
Next, two noblemen, whom' the king had&#xD;
sent to meet and attend the Cardinal. Then&#xD;
followed his Emineicae&#xD;
Cardinal Savelli was a strong, tall man,&#xD;
with, *-biosd bat athei lov brow, bulging&#xD;
ont at-be temples. Piercing gray eyes, that&#xD;
tould soften soas to look tenderly beautiful,&#xD;
&#xD;
flashed from beneath the thick, well arched&#xD;
eyebrows. His mouth was handsome, but,&#xD;
with a very sensual: expression about the&#xD;
thick muscles around it, and on the full,&#xD;
proud chin.&#xD;
He was dressed in a long scarlet robe,&#xD;
confined by a broad scarf of the same color,,&#xD;
around the lower part of his chest. A cross&#xD;
of gold hung by a broad ribbon on his&#xD;
breast.- His head was covered with a small&#xD;
scull-cap, around the edge. of which, the&#xD;
black hair curled.&#xD;
Behind him, rode Father Domingo, th,&#xD;
Jesuit,'upon a stout, rough black horse. He&#xD;
was attired in dead black, and carried a&#xD;
large cross of gold in his right hand. This&#xD;
man was of herculean frame; his face seem-&#xD;
ed originally to have possessed a noble and&#xD;
handsome aspect, Nay, the features were&#xD;
still handsome and noble, but a curious ex-&#xD;
pression of ferocity and cunning seemed, as&#xD;
it were1 forced upon them.&#xD;
Then a considerable train followed the&#xD;
Cardinal.&#xD;
The crowd was now all alive with curious&#xD;
eyes and gaping mouths. It is true, there&#xD;
was nothing peculiarly attractive for them,&#xD;
in the appearance or retinue of the Cardinali&#xD;
But thefame of his sanctity, the knowledge.&#xD;
that he was to organise the Inquisition, and&#xD;
the honor with which the king received him,&#xD;
eombinedto-give him a high position in the&#xD;
eyes of Lisbon. Above all, there was some.&#xD;
thing new about him and his ways,'which&#xD;
attracted the people.&#xD;
Every knee was bent as his Eminence&#xD;
rode past. He replied to these salutations&#xD;
by'spreading out his right hand and several&#xD;
times pronouncing the blessing:&#xD;
"Benedicite, mei filii I"&#xD;
Arrived at the royalepalace, the Cardinal&#xD;
dismounted. Aroyal official held his stir-&#xD;
ruppand another received his bridle. Father&#xD;
Domingo, also dismounting, held the golden&#xD;
cross he bore, behind the Cardinal's head,&#xD;
taking' care to keep equal steps with him.&#xD;
A Brilliant throng of nobles'and household&#xD;
officers. awaited him at the gates, while 'the&#xD;
soldiers of the body guard, were ranged in&#xD;
glittering lines to receive the Cardinal. He,&#xD;
again, blessed all, with proud humility bend.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
a'&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
On, PLoTs AND&#xD;
&#xD;
ing his head,,ascended the staircase with&#xD;
stately step.                ,I&#xD;
The council were assembled.. Their Emin-&#xD;
ences, the Cardinals Savelli and Georgio, sat&#xD;
to the right and left of the king. Above the&#xD;
head of Savelli, the Jesuit held the golden&#xD;
cross.&#xD;
Another priest performed the same office&#xD;
for Georgio. From the back of Juan's&#xD;
throne, and above ,hs head, glittered a&#xD;
crown.&#xD;
"We are now assembled in council," said&#xD;
Don Antonio to those present, "for the pur-&#xD;
pese of investigating the act of attaching&#xD;
certain scrolls, with sacrilegious writing to&#xD;
the door of the churches of this city; also&#xD;
to reconsider the mode of action in regard&#xD;
to discovering the murderers of the priest&#xD;
Firma Fida. Then lastly to invest his Emin-&#xD;
ence, the Cardinal Savelli, with full powers&#xD;
to organise the Inquisition."&#xD;
"My authority is derived from his holi-&#xD;
ness. I bear a papal bullI" cried Savelli, in&#xD;
a deep proud voice.&#xD;
The minister bowed.-&#xD;
" We will invest your Eminence with&#xD;
power to judge and execute in the kingdom&#xD;
of Porlagal." - The king nodded approv-&#xD;
ingly, He was jealous of his royal privi-&#xD;
leges, however much devoted to the church.&#xD;
"In regard to the 'sacrilegious writing, an&#xD;
event las occurred, which will happily end&#xD;
all inquiries. The perpetrator of the crime,&#xD;
- propably tormented by conscience --has&#xD;
delivered himself up to justice." There was&#xD;
a movement of surprise amotig all but the&#xD;
king, whose eyes merely gleamed with a&#xD;
joyous dash.&#xD;
"I considered it best to place him before&#xD;
the council," said Don Antonio; "doth yourI&#xD;
majesty desire to interrogate him?"&#xD;
"No, do you inquire of .him concerning&#xD;
the deed; let him be brought in quickly,"&#xD;
said Juan.&#xD;
Don Antonio gave a sign.&#xD;
There was a bustle and movement with- I&#xD;
out, and Don Hernando da Costa, eurroun f&#xD;
dad by guards, was brought into the apart-E&#xD;
meant.                                 - i&#xD;
"This youth r' exclaimed the king;. "im- I&#xD;

"So it mightwell seem to your majesty.&#xD;
For favors have been heaped.upouhim and&#xD;
upon his family. Yet heconfesses himself&#xD;
the perpetrator of. this erima," said Don An-&#xD;
tonio.&#xD;
The duke di Azambuja murmured: "His&#xD;
father was a baptized Jew*and the children&#xD;
are unbelievers. But. give: me rather ten&#xD;
thousand heretics than one Inqisitor Gene-&#xD;
ral;" and he threw a look of hate uponithe&#xD;
proud Savelli.&#xD;
"So think I, my lord," said the .count di,&#xD;
Almaveda, who leaned upon the back of the&#xD;
duke's chair.&#xD;
"So think all good men," rejoined the&#xD;
duke. - "Still, there is but onetway to avoid&#xD;
this, and that must soon be tried "-&#xD;
"I know, whatyou mean I God and the&#xD;
rightful heir."&#xD;
"Silence I"&#xD;
The prisoner looked 'up Every eye was&#xD;
bent upon him. His own cheeks again were&#xD;
covered with a bright flush; and his eyes&#xD;
flashed with excitement, when he perceived&#xD;
the presence he stood 'in Juan 'threw a,&#xD;
glance, in, which surprise and anger were&#xD;
mixed, upon the young man.&#xD;
Hernando's cheeks were hollow; his eyes&#xD;
had sunk far down beneath- his forehead,&#xD;
and gleamed like wild ignq fatuts from&#xD;
the depth of a marsh. His hair hanging&#xD;
smoothly down,-made only the more evident&#xD;
by its black color, the mottled, ghastly pate&#xD;
complexion, which now disfigured. the young,&#xD;
man.&#xD;
His right hand was torn and covered with&#xD;
clotted blood. For in the wildness of his&#xD;
remorse, he had dashed the hand whieh had&#xD;
committed fratricide, against walls and eorsA&#xD;
ners, until the flesh was merely lacerated.&#xD;
The young mai hadsuffered terrible tor-&#xD;
ments. . He writhed underthe punishment&#xD;
of the damned. He felt the fate of the aw&#xD;
cursed.&#xD;
Let theologian* believe and teach, that&#xD;
heaven is ever so far above, and hell everso&#xD;
far beneath us, the experience of life will&#xD;
show, that there is a heaven and a hell with-&#xD;
n the bosom of man. These are, as it werap&#xD;
ooked and guarded by a goodand an evil&#xD;
spirit. Do we resign ourselves to' the' in.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7223-00000029"/>&#xD;
56              .         T-N a FATI&#xD;
fiuence' of the evilspirit, we imagine still&#xD;
that we 'preserve dominion over'him. We&#xD;
think:him our slave, to beused and put away&#xD;
as we chose. , But the evil spirit may then&#xD;
be compared to the witches of German fairy&#xD;
tales. When the slightest part of any one's&#xD;
body, s a.lock of hair, or a scraping ot the&#xD;
nail had.been given up to them,1 they had&#xD;
power' to 'ride the man each night through&#xD;
storms and -seas and deserts., In this way&#xD;
they inflicted torments on the sufferers, until&#xD;
they, had broken their strength, health,&#xD;
beauty, mental faculties and religion. At&#xD;
last the unhappy victim was released, either&#xD;
by death 'or by a resignation of his soul to&#xD;
the witch. And so when we have given up to&#xD;
the spirit of evil the least part of our actions,&#xD;
passions or feelings, -he has power over us,&#xD;
and rides the soul and body either to death&#xD;
or perdition.&#xD;
Hernando had resigned his passions for&#xD;
onceto evil influence, attired, as it was, in&#xD;
the rosy.fires of love. And, since-then, day&#xD;
and night, the evil spirit ,sat on his heart,&#xD;
and spurred it through the bitter storm of&#xD;
helpless remorse, the deep sea of irreparable&#xD;
guilt, and the barren desert of hopeless des.&#xD;
pair. This had broken his strength, beauty&#xD;
and faculties. of mind.. This had spurred&#xD;
him - not-to perdition - but perhaps to&#xD;
death!&#xD;
?Do you confess having written this scroll,&#xD;
and affixedit to the Cathedral door !" inqui.&#xD;
redthe minister.&#xD;
"I do I" replied Hernando, in a firm voice,&#xD;
looking boldly up.&#xD;
A start of surprise shook the company at&#xD;
this bold manner, in a criminal, whose con-&#xD;
demnation was certain.&#xD;
"Give us the reasons of this strangely&#xD;
saerileglous act!"&#xD;
Hernando was silent for a moment. Then&#xD;
looking fell at theking said:&#xD;
"What I belive to be true, I openly affir.&#xD;
med, When you demanded the criminal I&#xD;
delivered myself up. I. am an Israelite, a&#xD;

"Blasphemy I" cried both cardinals, rising&#xD;
in great wrath.&#xD;
"Choke that blaspheming dog with a&#xD;
flaming firebrand I" added Savelli, almost&#xD;
springing on Hernando.&#xD;
The Jesuit that stood behind the-cardinal&#xD;
did not move. Great drops of sweat rolled,&#xD;
from his face and bands, and his eyes were&#xD;
cast down.&#xD;
Hernando relapsed into listless silence.&#xD;
The noblemen looked at each other in&#xD;
blank amazement. The count di Almaveda&#xD;
sat with calm face, but with hands so con-&#xD;
vulsively closed that the nails entered into,&#xD;
the flesh.&#xD;
The king bit his lip with but illy suppres.&#xD;
sed wrath. He felt, as if he should like to&#xD;
spring at the young man, and tear him to&#xD;
pieces. Don Antonio was the most composed&#xD;
of those present. For even the guards shot&#xD;
looks of anger at the, unfortunate Hernando.&#xD;
A moment this silence lasted.  W -&#xD;
Then the Cardinal Savelli turned to the&#xD;
king.&#xD;
"Sire," he said, still flushed with wrath,&#xD;
"if such men existin Portugal,the Inquisition&#xD;
is indeed the only measure, which can avoid&#xD;
the fall of the church and throne. The cur-&#xD;
sed heretics of Germany and Switzerland,,&#xD;
are saints compared with this youth. ,The&#xD;
church is poor in tortures to punish sins&#xD;
like his. Nevertheless, we sball do our duty.&#xD;
The justice of the king must deliver him&#xD;
into the hands of the Inquisition for, against&#xD;
the church he has sinned most. This after.&#xD;
noon, I shall, with the permission of your'&#xD;
gracious majesty, organise a tribunal. To-&#xD;
morrow, this heretic shall be submitted to&#xD;
the question."&#xD;
"The question ?" inquired the king. "Is&#xD;
that necessary ?"&#xD;
, "Assuredly Sire!" replied the cardinal.&#xD;
"He doubtless has accomplices."&#xD;
"If you think so, Cardinal, submit him to&#xD;
the question I"&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, PLOTS       AND&#xD;
A cold thrill shot through the assembly,&#xD;
at these words. The king's permission bad&#xD;
been granted to employ the question, pro-&#xD;
perly called, the torture. Hernando was led&#xD;
out scarcely conscious ,of what had been&#xD;
spoken. Torture or no torture-the greatest&#xD;
torture was within his bosom, and no rack&#xD;
could tear his limbs more than remorse had&#xD;
torn his soul.&#xD;
"I place the castle at your disposal, Car-&#xD;
dinal;" said the king.&#xD;
"It is not necessary, sire," replied Savelli&#xD;
"I have already chosen the Convent of Santa&#xD;
Cruz to be occupied in the service of the&#xD;
holy Inquisition, until a proper palace can&#xD;
he erected. The convent has strong prisons,&#xD;
and deep vaults."&#xD;
"Do as you please."&#xD;
"Thanks to your majesty, the true cross&#xD;
will reign undefiled in Portugal. A solemn&#xD;
service, and mass shall be held this evening,&#xD;
atthe royal chapel to celebrate the establish.&#xD;
ment of the holy tribunal in this land."&#xD;
"But aire," the duke di Azambuja ventu-&#xD;
redto say, "will the nobles and Cortes accede&#xD;
to this ?"&#xD;
"Need I ought of their consent in the&#xD;
establishment of this institution, my Lord of&#xD;
Azambuja?" inquired the king, angrily.&#xD;
The council was over. The cardinals&#xD;
blessed the king. His Eminence, Cardinal&#xD;
Georgio departed, not quite satisfied with&#xD;
the mode of proceedings, for he was thrown&#xD;
entirely in the shade by his brotherly col&#xD;
league. Yet Savelli bore a papal bull, letters&#xD;
from the emperor, and was charged by his&#xD;
holiness to establish the Inquisition, while&#xD;
Georgio had no such charge.&#xD;
Savelli remained to give orders in regard&#xD;
to Hernando's prison. H    gave lengthy&#xD;
instructions to the officer,- ho was to take&#xD;
hin to the convent of Santa 'ruz, and guard&#xD;
him,there. He spent some tme in advising&#xD;
the Dominican monks, who would visit the&#xD;
prisoner, and exhort him to confess his ae-&#xD;
complices. And, last, lie ordered the royal&#xD;
headsman to be summoned. With this&#xD;
official the Cardinal had a long conference.&#xD;
The executioner gave an inventory of all the&#xD;
racks and instruments of torture on hand.&#xD;
Savelli selected such as suited his purpose,1&#xD;

and ordered him to have them removed from&#xD;
Ithe torture chamber in the castle, to the&#xD;
-great audience hallof the convent, and there&#xD;
kept in readiness. Finally, the executioner&#xD;
was bid to ettend in his official garb, next&#xD;
morning, at the convent.&#xD;
The reader will have seen, that Savelli&#xD;
was determined to introduce the Inquisition&#xD;
in style, as the present day would call it.--&#xD;
Don Antonio had given him an order placing&#xD;
at his disposition everything he might re-&#xD;
quire,for the execution of his project. Her-&#xD;
nando was conducted to prison.&#xD;
We look into a small dark vault. The&#xD;
arches that formed the ceiling seemed ready&#xD;
to break down with their own heavy weight.&#xD;
From the keystones upon the walls and the&#xD;
ceiling, grinned faces, that seemed to wear&#xD;
a demoniac smile, as the light of the single&#xD;
torch, which illumined the vault, rose and&#xD;
fell. The shadows slept thickin the corners.&#xD;
The floor was composed of large solid blocks&#xD;
of stone. A table, hewed from the same ma-&#xD;
terial, stood in the midst of thO vault. Up-&#xD;
on an iron spike, that projected from the&#xD;
stony slab of the table, stuck a smoky torch,&#xD;
that cast a flickering light upon the scene.&#xD;
Near the ceiling was a round aperture&#xD;
through the thick walls. The diameter of&#xD;
this air hole might have been about seven&#xD;
inches.  But its dimensions were still di-&#xD;
minished by a strong iron bar that divided&#xD;
the air hole into halves. The external mouth&#xD;
of this hole opened upon the pavement of a&#xD;
chapel, which, again, by open windows,&#xD;
communicated with the court yard of the&#xD;
convent of Santa Cruz. The vaults, used&#xD;
sometimes for penitential exercises and&#xD;
punishments of transgressing monks, had&#xD;
been appropriated by Cardinal Savelli; they&#xD;
were now prisons of the Inquisition. In the&#xD;
vault above described, Hernando was placed.&#xD;
The smoky light leaped over his form, as he&#xD;
lay stretched upon the straw that had been&#xD;
heaped up in one corner. All waq silent,&#xD;
very silent.&#xD;
What different kinds of silence exist!-&#xD;
There is the sweet quiet of the summer&#xD;
noon, under green leaves, and a dreamy&#xD;
sky, with flowers and bees, and velvetty&#xD;
grass around you, all quiet, sweetly quiet.-&#xD;

were e aims of his life. His daughter was&#xD;
his only child. She was once destined to&#xD;
bear the honors of his house, perhaps, by a&#xD;
noble alliance, to add nw titles and wealth&#xD;
to it. So many proud hopes had the san-&#xD;
guine father founded upon Miranda, when&#xD;
he saw her grow up in beauty, and endowed&#xD;
with a more than ordinary share of wisdom.&#xD;
He had given her an education extraordi-&#xD;
nary even for a princess, at that time. After&#xD;
acquiring all the accomplishments usual to&#xD;
ladies of Portugal, she was sent in the train&#xD;
of the present queen dowager to the lively&#xD;
and brilliant court of Spain. Miranda had&#xD;
also visited the voluptuous and vicious court&#xD;
of Francis I, and finally returned to ?ortu-&#xD;
gal-a lady of the court, with beauty, ac-&#xD;
complishments and worldly wisdom-but&#xD;
without the least particle of virtue, piety, and&#xD;
nobleness.&#xD;

misfortune. He could not believe it, that&#xD;
the fair creature now sitting at his side, and&#xD;
smiling so calmly, had dishonored his house,&#xD;
and was in fact a thing the world scorns and&#xD;
scoffs at.&#xD;
When he had partially recovered, Don&#xD;
Nuna inquired in a broken voice:&#xD;
" But, Donna, if no husband will be found&#xD;
to cover your shame?"&#xD;
"Then a convent will! The family of&#xD;
Perez shall not be dishonored by me ! I am&#xD;
too proud of my name to make itea scoff and&#xD;

taking up a magnificent fan of ostrich&#xD;
feathers.&#xD;
" But whom do you propose to marry ?"&#xD;
inquired again the old noble.&#xD;
1 "Why," replied the lady, "there is my&#xD;
cousin.'&#xD;
" The governor of the East India sta-&#xD;

"CorrectI he is expected to return to-&#xD;

" Will he marry you?"&#xD;
"Do you doubt it?" and the lady threw a&#xD;

" But Don Nuna, Iassure you that hoth-&#xD;

cumstance forces me either to marty soon,&#xD;
or to enter a convent.  I have decided for&#xD;

robe in graceful folds.&#xD;
The old man was again composed.&#xD;

he added fiercely, " if you are not married,&#xD;

Don Nuna made a grave bow, and left the&#xD;
apartment.&#xD;
"After all not so bad I" murmured Mi-&#xD;
randa, "I shall marry my cousin, and con-&#xD;
tinue to keep my lovers. How disagreeable&#xD;
that my father should disturb us! He might&#xD;
have retired discreetly, when he saw Don&#xD;
Diego. But these Portuguese have such ex-&#xD;
alted notions of morality. So much behind&#xD;
the times."&#xD;
A half an hour afterwards the noble lady&#xD;
had retired to her couch to sleep sweetly,&#xD;
and dream of past and future pleasures.&#xD;
Her father returned to his apartment and&#xD;
sat down, with his brain frozen to ice, his&#xD;
heart heavy as lead, his blood turned to&#xD;
water, and his muscles rigid. There he sat&#xD;
throughout the long dreary nightmotionless.&#xD;
The morning mounted the skies, and the&#xD;
golden beams of the sun fell upon the old&#xD;
man.- Oh! how sadly had the events of one&#xD;
night changed himI His proud head was&#xD;
bowed, his florid face pqle as ashes; his&#xD;
dark and lively eyes, sunken and surrounded&#xD;
by tinges of rusty red; his dignified mien&#xD;
had given away to a desponding, heartbrdken&#xD;
look of despair.&#xD;
Don Diego walked rapidly' through the&#xD;
streets, lost in thought. He had reached the&#xD;
palace di Azambuja before he remarked that&#xD;
he was alone.-.&#xD;

"The page may have'gone somewhere,"&#xD;
he mused, and dismissing the eireumstance&#xD;
from his mind, enteredthe palace,andsought&#xD;
his bed.&#xD;
Don Diego had loved too much, and too&#xD;
easily to grieve deeply about the discovery&#xD;
of his amour with Miranda. Especially since&#xD;
he saw how calmly the young lady bore it.&#xD;
Donna Gloria had separated from Diego&#xD;
a few steps ' from the palace di Azambuja,&#xD;
and retreating into a doorway, waited until&#xD;
the young noble had disappeared beneath&#xD;
the stately doorway. Then she continued to&#xD;
walk along the street, unconscious of where&#xD;
it led to. For Gloria was so ignorant of the&#xD;
streets of Lisbon, that it was impossible for&#xD;
her to return to the palace without a guide.&#xD;
But where could a guide be found? Gloria&#xD;
was perplexed. She looked     and down.&#xD;
All empty, not being to bseen upon the&#xD;
streets.(&#xD;
Sheb thought erself of the river, which&#xD;
passed by the pa ace. So she turned down&#xD;
the street and descended the declivity, until&#xD;
she arrived at the water. Along the river&#xD;
were at that time some of the vilest, lowest&#xD;
inns, where sailors and negroes rioted in dirt&#xD;
and filthy wine. From the windows and&#xD;
doors of these inns, light shone out upon the&#xD;
street. Noise and sounds of quarrelling re.&#xD;
souded through the night. Men drunk&#xD;
lay sleepingin the soft mud. Others growled&#xD;
andeursed, as they tottered around. Anon&#xD;
angry voices were loud in altercation, and&#xD;
theerash of falling tables and chairs, bespoke&#xD;
scenes of violence. Gloria, the highborn&#xD;
lady, who was used to silk, and gems, and&#xD;
gilding and marble, to scenes of beauty and&#xD;
words of wit and elegance, was thus sudden-&#xD;
ly thrown into the vilest part of a great city.&#xD;
Some drunken sailors had perceived her and&#xD;
staggered towards the trembling lady.&#xD;
"Well youngster," cried one, "do you not&#xD;
long for the merry life of a sailor ?"&#xD;
"1He says he wants to serve under me,"&#xD;
growled a boatswain, taking hold of Gloria's&#xD;
arm.&#xD;
"Let me proceed on my way," begged the&#xD;
lady, earnestly shaking off the boatswain's&#xD;
grasp.&#xD;
"What a tender voice," laughed another&#xD;
&#xD;
L SE CRE T,&#xD;
sailor; "take off your mask, my merry boy,"&#xD;
and he endeavored to tear it from the lady's&#xD;
face.&#xD;
Wild with fear Gloria tore away, leaving&#xD;
the mask in his hands. Away she ran,down&#xD;
the street with the rapidity of the frighted&#xD;
hare. Behind her sounded the shouts of the&#xD;
sailors. She saw nothing, heard nothing,&#xD;
but ran on with all her strength; suddenly&#xD;
she ran against some one, and with such&#xD;
suddenness and force that the shock threw&#xD;
her upon the ground. There she lay gas-&#xD;
ping for breath.&#xD;
The man she had run against,kindly bent&#xD;
over her and inquired:&#xD;
"Are you hurt boy?"&#xD;
"No," replied Gloria.&#xD;
The man assisted her to rise, and then&#xD;
turning the light of the dark lantern he car-&#xD;
ried, full upon her face exclaimed:&#xD;
" The Countess di Voga!"&#xD;
The light had also fallen upon his features,&#xD;
and Donna Gloria in her turn recognised,&#xD;
Pater Marcus.'&#xD;
" Conduct me home, father, if you please,'&#xD;
said Gloria and took the Pater's hand.&#xD;
Father Marcus conducted her to the sum-&#xD;
mer pavilion in silence.&#xD;

"Then he lives, and is near us I"&#xD;
"We have no time, to waste in this idle&#xD;

"It is false; it can not be true ! Enrique&#xD;

"Obstinate youth I follow me, and in a&#xD;

For I see,nothing else will convince you that&#xD;
he is alive, although I see not the slightest&#xD;

Taking up his lantern, father Domingo&#xD;
left the vault, followed by Hernando. The&#xD;
young man scarcely breathed, so intense&#xD;
were the doubts, hopes and fears that agita-&#xD;
ted his bosom.&#xD;
They proceeded about twenty paces along&#xD;
a low vaulted passage, and stopped before a&#xD;
door of iron,.like that of the cell, which they&#xD;
had just left. The priest unlocked it.&#xD;
Disturbed by the noise, the prisoner leap-&#xD;
ed up and cried:&#xD;
"Who are ye ? what do you want?"&#xD;
Hernando gave a cry, a moan of joy, and&#xD;
the priest, turning the beams of the dark&#xD;
lantern into the vault, illuminated the form&#xD;
of AriguelI&#xD;
He stood erect, pale, but beautiful as ever,&#xD;
his hair, floating unarravged over his shoul.&#xD;
den. Hernando gave a sigh of joy, of in.&#xD;
tense relief. Things swam before his&#xD;
eyes, dizziness overcame him, and he sunk&#xD;
fainting at the feet of Father Domingo.&#xD;

When tooquick a change from joy to grief,&#xD;
or from sorrow to gladness is felt in the&#xD;

The priest bent down and raised Hernan&#xD;

do's head. The fainting was but moment.&#xD;
ry; almost immediately Hernando recovered&#xD;
again. Rising, he threw himself at the feet&#xD;
of the trembling Enrique.&#xD;
Let the reader portray to himself, the&#xD;
dark vault, the stream of dim light from the&#xD;
lantern, the figure of the priest, large and&#xD;
gloomy, standing at the door. In the low,&#xD;
heavy vault, the fair, beautiful Enrique, and&#xD;
at his feet, sobbing with joy, Hernando.h,&#xD;
"Forgive me, my brother, forgive! I have&#xD;
suffered awfully. I have been punished ter-&#xD;

Enrique slowly bent over his brother, and&#xD;
kissed his forehead.&#xD;
" Brother, I ibrgive you! Come to my&#xD;
bosom,Hernando I,&#xD;
The two brothers embraced.&#xD;
"1I do not understand this. I will ask an&#xD;
explanation at some future time. Now we&#xD;
must hasten not to lose all chance of esespe.&#xD;
Follow mel" said the priest. The two broth&#xD;
ers arm in arm followed his steps. He led&#xD;
them to one end of the passage, and there&#xD;
touching a spring, turned a large stone&#xD;
aside from its position. Through the dark&#xD;
opening, the Jesuit followed by the brothers&#xD;
crept, and stood in a damp, low, apartment&#xD;
of circular form. Around the walls were&#xD;
small niches, with heavy pillars between&#xD;
them. In each of the niches, was the Agure&#xD;
of a coffin in raised stones.&#xD;
" Formerly, nuns occupied this convent.&#xD;
In these niches, those who broke the vows&#xD;
of celibacy were immured. They died of&#xD;
hunger and want of air," said their guide&#xD;
to the brothers. Both shuddered.&#xD;
" How terrible is the vengeance of the&#xD;
Church," whispered Enrique.&#xD;
Meanwhile the Jesuit proceeded to one of&#xD;
the niches, and opened a small door that&#xD;
seemed to lead into one of the pillars. The&#xD;
. pillar was hollow and contained the landing&#xD;
place of a flight of steps. They closed the&#xD;
. door again, and ascended the steps.&#xD;
"Now hasten," said Domingo, still walk-&#xD;

The brothers kept behind him. They as.&#xD;

The roof was loose and crumbling. At last&#xD;

were there. They mounted and rode toward&#xD;
Belem. Not far beyond the village they&#xD;
stopped. A boat awaited them in the midst&#xD;
of the river. At a sign from the priest it&#xD;
came on shore and received the brothers.&#xD;
"This boat will take you on board of a&#xD;
ship, which will not stars away before to.&#xD;

the ship and convey to you letters from the&#xD;

The priest turned his horse's head and re-&#xD;

The sailors whipped the water with their&#xD;
long oars and the boat flew over the waving&#xD;
surface to the side of a large Duteh built&#xD;
vessel, that lay beyond Belem in a small&#xD;
harbor, all concealed and surrounded by&#xD;
rocks. Hernando and Enrique mounted the&#xD;
deck, and were kindly received by Mynheer&#xD;
Sporaso, the captain.&#xD;
He immediately explained that he was a&#xD;
Spanish Israelite escaped to Holland. He&#xD;
had formerly been in the Spanish navy, and&#xD;
a companion of Captain da Costa the father&#xD;
of Hernando and Enrique.&#xD;
He now continued his old trade of seafa-&#xD;
ring in the merchant service of Holland. For&#xD;
the sake of the father, he received the young&#xD;
men in a very affectionate manner. They&#xD;
entered the cabin to enjoy some rest after&#xD;
the exhausting events of the night.&#xD;
Enrique communicated, next morning, to&#xD;
his brother, the manner of his escape from&#xD;
death. We will acquaint the reader with it&#xD;
in a few words.&#xD;
When Enrique was thrown from the bal-&#xD;

Happily a fisherman's bark lay at the foot of&#xD;
the cliff,shaded from the sun by its overhang-&#xD;

he immediately approached, and succeeded&#xD;

in drawing him from the waves.-The young&#xD;
man had fainted. The fisherman took him&#xD;
to the town of Peniche, from whence after a&#xD;
slight illness, which lasted several days, he&#xD;
returned to Salonga. Hernando wasalready&#xD;
away; Enrique fell now into a severe fever,&#xD;
during which he was attended by the old&#xD;
dame Margarita. When sufficiently recover-&#xD;
ed, he returned to Lisbon, taking the old&#xD;
dame along, to restore her to the countess&#xD;
Solani. But before reaching the city he was&#xD;
arrested, on suspicion of being an accom-&#xD;
plice of his brother Hernando. Dame Mar.&#xD;

in his company. Both were imprisoned in&#xD;
vaults near Hernando's prison. What fur.&#xD;
there occurred in regard to Enrique we know.&#xD;

Father Marcus inquired:&#xD;
"Well lady, how happened it that I found,&#xD;
you lost among the streets, attired in men's&#xD;
clothes, and so long after the conspirators&#xD;

"1I will tell you, father," replied Gloria.&#xD;
"For certain purposes, I found it advisable&#xD;
to follow the duke di Azambuja into his pal-&#xD;
ace. From thence, it was impossible for me&#xD;
to escape again, without recognition, in the&#xD;

"But without cowl, your face gould have&#xD;

A flush mounted to Gloria's brow.&#xD;
"You dare say this to my face !" she&#xD;
cried; but then feeling how much she was&#xD;
obliged to satisfy the priest to prevent pre-&#xD;
mature disclosures, she added:&#xD;
"Your suspicions are natural. But I&#xD;
wore a mask Searching for my way along the&#xD;
river, I was accosted by some rough sailors,,&#xD;
who tore my mask away. ThenI led, and&#xD;
happily met you."&#xD;

"But found it an impossibility to prostrate&#xD;
such a worthy pillar of the Church, as you&#xD;
are?" cried Gloria, laughing. "Well what&#xD;
have you seen at the meeting ?" she further&#xD;
inquired.&#xD;
"All," was the reply. "LadyI we must&#xD;
acquaint the King with the existence of this&#xD;
plot. Having promised secresy to you I can&#xD;
not act without your permission. Best it&#xD;
would be, for you to inform his majesty, and&#xD;
then refer him to me for particulars," added&#xD;
father Marcus.&#xD;
"1I will do as you advise," replied Gloria,&#xD;
"but not yet."&#xD;
"If we delay, the information may come&#xD;
too late."&#xD;
" His majesty shall know all within three&#xD;
days. Will this do?"&#xD;
"PerfectlyI Good night, Countess."&#xD;
"The priest retired, and Gloria entered&#xD;
her sleeping apartment.&#xD;
Fidaro had waited and waited, until late&#xD;
at night. Still the Countes had not return-&#xD;

ria entered the outer apartments, her'&#xD;
conversation with the priest awakened him.&#xD;
He listened and waited. Finally the priest&#xD;
departed, and Fidaro, who expected to see&#xD;
the lady enter, saw the door open. But it&#xD;
was not the Countess, but a man, with his&#xD;
hat drawn far over his brows, that stood be-&#xD;
fore him.&#xD;
The reader will recollect that Gloria was&#xD;
disguised in male attire. But Fidaro knew&#xD;
it not. Jealousy like a poisoned dagger pier.&#xD;
ced his heart. With a cry of rage he sprang&#xD;
at the man, and bore him to the earth.&#xD;
" What brought you here ?" he inquired,&#xD;
in a huskyovoice, full of wrath, holding his&#xD;
dagger at Gloria's throat.&#xD;
" Do you not know me,Fidaro ?" inquired&#xD;
the countess.&#xD;
In a Moment he had released her, lifted&#xD;
her from the floor, and pressed her to his&#xD;
heart. Unable to resist,Gloria resigned her-&#xD;

Fidaro released her from his arms. There&#xD;

embraces of Prometheus warmed a marble&#xD;
statue to life and love. - The embraces of Fi-&#xD;
daro at least caused a small feeling of pity&#xD;
and liking for him in 'the heart of Gloria.'&#xD;
" Fidaro," shesaid, " I have admitted you&#xD;
to my confidence, and hope you will con-&#xD;
duct yourself accAdingly. A gentleman&#xD;
admitted to a lady's chamber, under these&#xD;
circumstances, will conduct himself at night&#xD;
and alone, in the same way as he would at&#xD;
noon, when she is surrounded by servants."&#xD;
" Oh! lady, be not offended! my passion&#xD;
got the better of my reason."&#xD;
" I am not offended. But what was done&#xD;
in a moment of passion, must not be repea-&#xD;
ted."&#xD;
Fidaro's face fell. His .eyes rested sor-&#xD;
rowfully upon the floor.&#xD;
"1I have assumed these clothes in the pal-&#xD;
ace di Azambuja, and accompanied Don&#xD;
Diego to night, in your stead. The letters&#xD;
are delivered. Go home now, and, return&#xD;
tomorrow for these clothes."&#xD;
The page was reluctant to leave.&#xD;
" Go," and Gloria preceded him, an&amp;amp;&#xD;
opened the secret door.&#xD;
Fidaro looked so desponding, that the&#xD;
Countess smiled kindly upon him, and gave&#xD;
him her hand to kiss as he went away.&#xD;
When Fidaro had gone Gloria retired to&#xD;
bed.&#xD;
There was one person however, in the&#xD;
summer pavilion, whose eyes closed not in&#xD;
sleep that night. There was one whose bo-&#xD;
som felt the pains of deceived love, inwhose.&#xD;
heart jealousy covered affection with black&#xD;
spots of decay.&#xD;
It was Maria Flanos. With the curiosity&#xD;
so natural to women, and to chambermaida&#xD;
in particular, she had arisen from her bed,&#xD;
when she heard the sounds of conversation&#xD;
in her mistress' apartment, and listened out&#xD;
side the door.&#xD;
She saw enough to convince her ;hat Fi-&#xD;

Duke di Azambuja presiding."&#xD;
"My brother!", The reader may remark&#xD;
that in the sixteenth century the prejudice&#xD;
against bastards was much less strong thai&#xD;
it is at the present time.&#xD;
" Lady I be kind enough to explain the&#xD;
particulars of all this," said the king.&#xD;
Gloria obeyed. From the time of receiv&#xD;
ing the casket to the events of the past night&#xD;
all was made known to the king.&#xD;
Juan sounded the rattle.&#xD;
Pages appeared.&#xD;
"Call Father Marcus, immediately; " com-&#xD;
manded the king. The pages hastened to&#xD;
summon him.&#xD;
In a few moments the priest stood in the&#xD;
presence of the king. He attested all that&#xD;
Gloria had related. The papers were also&#xD;
produced by Father Marcus, who had kept&#xD;
them, and deciphered by him.&#xD;
The king was satisfied; nay more lie was&#xD;
glad; glad to find his suspicions' unjust;&#xD;
glad to see that Gloria had, by her own&#xD;
means, saved him from imminent dangers.&#xD;
Glad to discover causes that enabled him&#xD;
with justice to remove a conspiring brother,&#xD;
and to put down treacherous nobles. The&#xD;
king, therefore, glad and grateful, embraced&#xD;
Donna Gloria with ardent expressions of&#xD;
love.              '&#xD;
But the lady was not yet satisfied. Arch-&#xD;
ing her stately neck nhe met the king's em-&#xD;
brace with a face of cold disdain, and turn-&#xD;
ed to leave the apartment. Anxious to ob.&#xD;
viate the impression his suspicions had made&#xD;
on the Countess' mind, Juan took her hand,&#xD;
and, by the most affectionate words only,&#xD;
succeeded in somewhat allaying Gloria's&#xD;
outraged feelings.&#xD;
" Ask for a peace offering my beloved,"&#xD;
said the king. "I swear upon this cross, to&#xD;
grant you, any thing you ask !" and heI&#xD;
touched a cross upon the table, with his&#xD;
lips.&#xD;
" Well, sire," replied Gloria considerably&#xD;
pacified,1" I will retain the right to make a&#xD;
request until a suitable opportunity occurs.I&#xD;
You will always be ready to grant it?" I&#xD;
"I have sworn," was the reply. "But,"|&#xD;
added Juan, "could you not give me the eas-|&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
e ket in which those papers were contained?&#xD;
His late majesty, my father, once mentioned&#xD;
, a casket of steel, which in a secret drawer&#xD;
e contains important documents  Perhaps it&#xD;
is the same, you now possess!"-I&#xD;
Gloria rose and said: "Your majesty shall&#xD;
e see it," and left the apartment. Entering&#xD;
her bed chamber, she turned to the closet&#xD;
wherein she kept her valuables. At its side&#xD;
, stood Massor, the gipsy chief, the steelen&#xD;
casket in his hand. The door of the closet&#xD;
was open. Its lock had been forced.&#xD;
The gipsy chief quickly aporoached her.&#xD;
"Lady," he said, "you have been prying&#xD;
into mysteries; thank your stars that no'&#xD;
harm is done, and that I have abandoned&#xD;
those to whom you have acted as a spy. You&#xD;
have destroyed a conspiracy and men, whom&#xD;
it would now have been my province to des-&#xD;
troy. Therefore, I forgive you. I came&#xD;
merely to get this casket. But you will see&#xD;
ime again, shortly. Good night."  The gip.&#xD;
sy bowed, and disappeared through the&#xD;
window ere Gloria could speak a word, or&#xD;
even recover from her astonishment.&#xD;
She returned to the king, and said:&#xD;
"I can not find the casket, sire !"&#xD;
"No matter, Donna," replied Juan.&#xD;
Maria had listened to all this, indifferent.&#xD;
ly, except to perceive that she had not been&#xD;
able to harm Gloria. The Countess howev-&#xD;
er, who could appreciate the pangs of disap-&#xD;
pointed love, said kindly:&#xD;
."Go, child, I forgive you. Go to your-&#xD;
apartments." Maria went weeping.&#xD;
The king had his attendants called, and&#xD;
instantly sent two of them to summon Don&#xD;
Antonio the minister and' Don Pedro diGar-&#xD;
cia, the captain of the royal guards.&#xD;

THE ARREST.&#xD;
On the same evening, when the things rela-&#xD;
ted in the previous chapter occurred, Don&#xD;
Diego di Azambuja returned ratherlate from&#xD;
a visit this bride.&#xD;
He hed scarcely divested himself of his&#xD;
hat and sword, and laid down upon a couch,&#xD;
when Amaso one of the duke's pages, and&#xD;
Carlo, the young man who had taken Gloria&#xD;
to Fidaro's chamber, entered. Perplexity&#xD;

was upon their face. Amaso carried in his&#xD;
*rms, the rich dresses which Gloria hadI&#xD;
thinown off, and the monk's habit.&#xD;
"What do you want? What is this ?'&#xD;
inquired Don Diego, in a petulant voice,&#xD;
wearily turning toward them.&#xD;
"A very curious thing, and it please you,&#xD;
sirl" replied Amaso.&#xD;
"What is curious? speak out!"&#xD;
"And it please you, my lord, I found a&#xD;
suit of mine missing, and these female gar-&#xD;
ments in its place."&#xD;
"Let me alone; one of the maids borrow-&#xD;
ed your clothes for a frolic, I suppose," re-&#xD;
plied Diego.&#xD;
"But, my lord, these are not the garments&#xD;
of a servant maiden." '&#xD;
Diego opened his eyes fully and looked at&#xD;
them. The page was certainly right. The&#xD;
garments were rich and must be those 'of a&#xD;
lady of high standing. Let the reader re-&#xD;
member that those were the times yet when&#xD;
arich dress was asign of the wearer's nobili-&#xD;
ty and wealth. In the present age the re-&#xD;
verse seems applicable.&#xD;
" And it please you sir, Carlo knows&#xD;
something about this circumstance."&#xD;
"What have you to say ?" inquired the&#xD;
noble turning to Carlo.&#xD;
"Why sir," replied Carlo, "when Fidaro&#xD;
changed his dress last night to accompany&#xD;
you, he would do it in the dark, and so put&#xD;
on Amaso's suit. At the same time he&#xD;
dropped a ring, which he left in- my hands.&#xD;
On the whole, Fidaro behaved in a veryre.&#xD;
narkable manner last night."&#xD;
"Let me see the ring.D"1&#xD;
Itwas given to Don Diego .&#xD;
"This isvery costly," he said. "Did you&#xD;
see," he cried at once springing up, "did&#xD;
you see Fidaro's face, even once last night ?"&#xD;
The page mused. At last he replied: "1I&#xD;
did not, my lord I"      ,&#xD;
"Neither did I; not a single time !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Don Diego. "It is possible then,&#xD;
that some one else has acq#mpanied me ?&#xD;
he reasoned. 'By thegarinents left behind&#xD;
this intruder may have been a lady, and&#xD;
moreover a lady of standing. She may hav&#xD;
assumed: the page's clothes and the mask&#xD;
covered her face. But why did I not recog&#xD;

And to his mind recurred every circum-&#xD;
stance of the preceding . night. The meet-&#xD;
in;, where this person was present. The&#xD;
things that had passed there.&#xD;
He now recollected the soft voice of the&#xD;
page, the circumstance of his disappearance&#xD;
ere they arrived at the palace, and a thou-&#xD;
sand other little things, that, insignificant as&#xD;
they were, now served to confirm Diego's&#xD;
opinion that a spy, disguised as Fidaro, had&#xD;
accompanied him. Regaining composure, he&#xD;
cried:&#xD;
"Call Fidaro, if he be found, and tell my&#xD;
father I desire to see him."&#xD;
The pages went on their errand. In a&#xD;
few moments, that seemed hours to Don Die-&#xD;
go, ao impatient was he, the Duke di Azam-&#xD;
buja was with his son. Don Diego quickly&#xD;
related to his parent, all he knew and feared.&#xD;
The old noble grew pale, and his teeth be-&#xD;
gan to chatter. He wanted tosay something,&#xD;
but all his faculties were paralysed.&#xD;
Fidaro was brought in by Amaso.&#xD;
"You may retire," said Don Diego to&#xD;
Carlo and Amaso; "but keep with some ser.&#xD;
vitors within call. I may need you present-&#xD;
ly.  The pages bowed and retired.&#xD;
"Were you with mt last night ?" inquir-&#xD;
ed Don Diego.&#xD;
"I was my lord I" replied the page.'&#xD;
"What clothes did you wear?"&#xD;
"A suit of Amaso's and a black mask."&#xD;
"Why did you take Amaso's clothes ?"&#xD;
"They were the first I found."&#xD;
"What did ou wear before you assumed&#xD;
Amaso's suit?'&#xD;
"A monk's gown, with a white cross."&#xD;
"Where did you accompany me to?"&#xD;
"To a house, where your highness met a&#xD;
lady."&#xD;
This had been communicated to Fidaro by&#xD;
Gloria, when in the morning he returned for&#xD;
the clothes&#xD;

Don Nuna di Perez put an end to the con-&#xD;
versation, by his entrance. After a little&#xD;
while he said:&#xD;
" Come, Isidore; let us ride a little."&#xD;
The soldier unwillingly assented, and&#xD;
took leave of Miranda.&#xD;
While they were riding in the cool even-&#xD;
ing air, the East Indian, extravagantly ex-&#xD;
pressed his undisguised admiration of Miran-&#xD;
da, It was dark, and, therefore, impossible&#xD;
for Don Isidore to perceive the deadly pale-&#xD;
ness, which sank on his uncle's features at his&#xD;
words. At last Don Nunamade an effort:&#xD;
" If you admire her so much," he said,&#xD;
"marry her! I am sure I would be content."&#xD;
- Don Isidore stopped, and cried in a voice&#xD;
of extreme joy:&#xD;
"Is it possible, uncle ? Do you think I&#xD;
can gain her affections ! Oh, if such happi-&#xD;
ness were in store for me I"&#xD;
At that moment they passed a house from&#xD;
the windows of which, streams of light flowed.&#xD;
The face of Isidore was bright, smiling and&#xD;
pushed with joy. The features of Don Nu-&#xD;
na pale and haggard. Could the heart of&#xD;
these two men have been seen at the same&#xD;
moment, still greater differences might have&#xD;
been observed.&#xD;
"f think that my daughter likes you,"&#xD;
said the old man hoarsely; "she was an ar-&#xD;
dent admirer of your deeds in East India."&#xD;
What a forced slow voice to pronounce those&#xD;
words!. But Isidore listened to the words&#xD;
only. Besides, he had been away long, and&#xD;
thought 't was age had changed his uncle's&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
" Thanks," he cried, "thanksI How hap-&#xD;
py you have maade ne I"&#xD;
Two days after, Isidore proposed,and was&#xD;
accepted by his beautiful cousin.&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
THE NOBLE       AND    THE QUEEN.&#xD;
An old ruined tower not far beyond&#xD;
Belem, looking upon the wide mouth of the&#xD;
bue Tagus, and upon the heaving sea be-&#xD;
10&#xD;
&#xD;
yond indicated the place,wvhere formerly an&#xD;
extensive and strong fortress or castle stood.&#xD;
It was a roughly built, and uncouth looking&#xD;
edifice, and,although of vast dimensions and&#xD;
great strength, had never been much useL&#xD;
But now, the widowed queen of Emmanuel,&#xD;
and sister of Charles the fifth, occasionally&#xD;
resided there.&#xD;
The 'night was murky. Great heaps of&#xD;
clouds lay like vast pillows upon the sea,&#xD;
and the winds tossed them about, like a&#xD;
busy housewife airing her beds. As it&#xD;
struck the sharp angles and walls of the&#xD;
castle, the wind moaned and sighed, and&#xD;
sometimes shrieked with a shrill unearthly&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
The dark figure of a man walked along the&#xD;
solitary banks of the Tagus to an old ruin-&#xD;
ed chapel, which, as it were, formed the&#xD;
most extreme point of Belem, The chapel&#xD;
belonged to the town yet. Around it was a&#xD;
court yard, filled with rubbish, and loose&#xD;
stones. Springing with a light foot over the&#xD;
stones, and avoiding, as carefully as' the&#xD;
small light would permit it,the heaps of rub-&#xD;
bish and pools of accumulated waters, he&#xD;
entered the ruined portal and walked&#xD;
through the gray aisle of the little chapel.&#xD;
Arrived at the back part, he stopped 'for a&#xD;
moment, in a listening attitude, and then,&#xD;
hearing nothing, bent down and cleared&#xD;
away some stones. Thus an oblong slab of&#xD;
granite was disclosed, which seemed the co-&#xD;
ver to some ancient grave. Removing itthe&#xD;
man uncovered the top of a coffin, set&#xD;
into a grave of stone. A touch upon a&#xD;
small iron nail that slightly projected from&#xD;
the right side of the grave, opened by a&#xD;
spring, the coffin lid, and disclosed a narrow&#xD;
staircase. Closing again the lid, the man&#xD;
walked quickly down the stairs. He must&#xD;
have been acquainted with the localities, for&#xD;
he walked in the dark. At the bottom of&#xD;
the stairs a passage began, and along&#xD;
this, he proceeded until brought to a halt by&#xD;
a heavy iron door. Taking a key from his&#xD;
pouch he opened it, and entered a room,&#xD;
furnished luxuriously. Striking fire, he&#xD;
lighted  two massive candelabras. Rich,&#xD;
very rich, were the adornments and the fhrn&#xD;
nitute of the apartment,&#xD;

TuT FATAL&#xD;
&#xD;
. The man threw off his hat-and cloak, and,&#xD;
turning to a large mirror, surveyed himself&#xD;
for some moments. He was of herculean&#xD;
proportions, with calm majestic and dignified&#xD;
features. It was Don Lionel Dian.&#xD;
He seized a silken cord on one side of the&#xD;
mirror, and pulled it.&#xD;
The tingle of a bell was heard through the&#xD;
sil  e,from far away.&#xD;
i lene,-&#xD;
In a few moments a door opposite to the&#xD;
one through which Don Lionel had come,&#xD;
opened, and the figure of a female entered.&#xD;
She was wrapped in a robe of silk brocade,&#xD;
embroidered with gold,and lined with snowy&#xD;
white fur. In the corners of her robe were&#xD;
the double eagle of Austria, and the lions of&#xD;
Spain, embroidered in gold and seed pearls.&#xD;
Her head was covered by a rich veil fastened&#xD;
to the hair, by diamonds and rubies. It&#xD;
was Eleanora of Austria, dowager queen of&#xD;
Portugal.&#xD;
The young and beautiful widow of Emman-&#xD;
uel, entered with a hesitating, yet eager step.&#xD;
Don Lionel threw himself upon his knees&#xD;
and kissed her hand immediately.&#xD;
"Thanks, Eleanora,.that you came. It is&#xD;
so long since I have had the happiness! Oh&#xD;
couldwe always remain together."&#xD;
"Dear Lionel," replied the queen, "you&#xD;
are selfish! You do not seem to think that&#xD;
I have counted the hours of separation, as&#xD;
well as you I"&#xD;
Don Lionel had arisen, and silently looked&#xD;
at the illustrious lady, but with looks of&#xD;
suoh-burning love 'that they exceeded any&#xD;
eloquence, his tongue might have produced.&#xD;
"Let us fit down, Lionel,", continued El-&#xD;
eanora.-&#xD;
The noble pressed the beautiful queen to&#xD;
bis bosom, and both sat down upon a Moor-&#xD;
ish divan.&#xD;
The reader may remark that, in royal&#xD;
amours, whether of males or females, roy-&#xD;
ality takes the initiative and courts the ob-&#xD;
ject of its love. For,a subject dares not raise&#xD;
his eyes,until majesty bends down. Don&#xD;
Lionel hi, in his youth, been a page in&#xD;
the household of queen Joanna, and later,&#xD;
been attached to the suite of her daughters.&#xD;
There, at the romantic court of Spain, and&#xD;
the brilliant one of Netherlands and Bur-&#xD;
&#xD;
L SECRET,&#xD;
gundy, Eleanora first loved the beautiful and&#xD;
dignified page, there the sentiments of a&#xD;
deep, live-long passion first bloomed in the&#xD;
heart of Don Lionel. From that timer but&#xD;
one shared the rich heart and grand, noble&#xD;
soul of this remarkable manwith the prince-&#xD;
ly Eleanora-it was his nation. A secret&#xD;
Israelite, half his being was devoted with&#xD;
constant affection to his faith and the welfare&#xD;
of his nation, the other half with a love&#xD;
pure, holy and calm as the stars-to Elea-&#xD;
nora.&#xD;
The princess knew that he was a secret&#xD;
Israelite. But, she also knew that he was&#xD;
descended from the heroes of the olden&#xD;
time, whose valor and splendor resounded&#xD;
through the East, from David and Solomon.&#xD;
She knew that he was of the lineage from&#xD;
which the priests told her Christ and the&#xD;
mother of God were descended. And hon-&#xD;
oring his ancestry, the Catholic princess&#xD;
forgot that he was of a heretic faith.&#xD;
An Israelite in those days, was hated, but&#xD;
not despised. For Spain's sweetest poets,&#xD;
and bravest knights, and wisest statesmen&#xD;
were the descendants of Israelites.&#xD;
So it had come to pass, that the grand.&#xD;
daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella the&#xD;
Catholic, loved Dop Lionel Dian, Vath a love&#xD;
that overleaped the boundaries of religion&#xD;
and station.&#xD;
Don Lionel loved her in return, with an&#xD;
affeetion worthy of its object,and of the heart&#xD;
that gave it.&#xD;
Yet he had seen her become the bride of&#xD;
Emmanuel, without despairing, though not&#xD;
without poignant sorrow. Because, from the&#xD;
first, he had considered, that though he&#xD;
might love a princess, he never could pos-&#xD;
sess her. But Eleanora's heart was almost&#xD;
rent. Yet the presence of Lionel, at the&#xD;
Portuguese court, consoled her somewhat.&#xD;
Still she hoped to be once-how or when,&#xD;
she troubled herself not to find out-united&#xD;
with the object of her affections. Woman's&#xD;
hope never dies.''I                 .&#xD;
Eleanora was beautiful. Her complexion&#xD;
was pale and delicate; her eyes dark and&#xD;
soft; and her features eminently pure and&#xD;
regular. Upon them rested that proud, self-&#xD;
possessed and coinmending expression which-&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, PLOTS AND&#xD;
we find to be an attribute of the scions of&#xD;
noble and ancient families, especially of the&#xD;
descendants of'royality.&#xD;
Don Lionel gently put back the veil that&#xD;
concealed the queen's face, and said:&#xD;
"Some very important affairs have pre-&#xD;
vented me from seeing-you for some time,&#xD;
dearest; and now affairs of importance bring&#xD;
Nae to you."&#xD;
"Then it was not your ownheartLionel!"&#xD;
reproachfully said Eleanora.&#xD;
" When we are elevated above the general&#xD;
mass, and the destiny of a people depends&#xD;
on our actions, our own affections, however&#xD;
strong and ardent, are forced into the back&#xD;
ground, princess!"&#xD;
'"Oh, but too true! The interest of Spain&#xD;
wedded me to Emmanuel," replied the&#xD;
queen.&#xD;
" In the days, when we were young, and&#xD;
the dowager queen of Portugal was but prin&#xD;
cess of Austria, when Don Lionel Dian, the&#xD;
leader of Israel, was but a page at the court&#xD;
of Philip and Joana, when we both were&#xD;
children, in the sunny groves of Castile,&#xD;
then we could meet and part, as the heart&#xD;
wished. But now   -"&#xD;
"Our love is the same, nevertheless, and&#xD;
will endure while life lasts! Not so Lio-&#xD;
nel ?"&#xD;
"While life lasts ! Embrace me again&#xD;
Eleanora, and then let us talk of more im-&#xD;
portant, though disagreeable matters."&#xD;
The queen drew the handsome noble to&#xD;
her heart, and covered his forehead with&#xD;
kisses. His pale, noble face, all oversha-&#xD;
dowed .with black curls, rested on her hea-&#xD;
ving bosom. Both remained silent for some&#xD;
minutes. The queen's eyes dwelled on herj&#xD;
lover's face, his were upraised to her coun-I&#xD;
tenance.I&#xD;
"Then slowly raising himself, he said:j&#xD;
"Eleanora, a messenger from your brother&#xD;
.Charles is on the way hither."&#xD;
"With what purpose ?"&#xD;
"To prepare you for a new allianceI"&#xD;
"Gracious heaven, again! are my feelings&#xD;
never taken into consideration ? the Emper-c&#xD;
or knows that I do not wish to marry again!"r&#xD;
and the beautiful lady walked agitatedly up 1&#xD;
and down the apartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
COUNTERPLOTS.                       75&#xD;
' My queen, my princess, my love I" cried&#xD;
Don Lionel, "be calmI have not I, with a&#xD;
composed countenance, heard that the king&#xD;
of France wilk possess in future, her, whom&#xD;
my soul loved from youth, whose image will&#xD;
be enshrined in my heart when death hath&#xD;
calmed it? Oh, Eleanora, were not my love&#xD;
so great, so pure and spiritual, the dagger or&#xD;
the poison would long have -silenced the&#xD;
painful cries of this breast."&#xD;
" You are, indeed, an example to me Lio.&#xD;
nel," replied Eleanora. "But is it really&#xD;
so, that I must wed the king of France ?"&#xD;
'-So  the Emperor has decided.   The&#xD;
fleur-de-lils will adorn that pure brow,whose&#xD;
whiteness they can not match. The crown&#xD;
of France will glow upon that dear head."&#xD;
" And the thorns of that crown,-shall&#xD;
pierce the heart beneath. Oh, to wed the&#xD;
gay, volatile Francis, to mix with the plea-&#xD;
sures of the French court, will be gall to&#xD;
my soul."&#xD;
"Francis is a proud and chivalric knight!''&#xD;
"I hate him, already. Then his mother,&#xD;
that bad Louise de Savoy, whose vices and&#xD;
cunning are the by word of Europe! Oh&#xD;
Lionel could we both die together now!"&#xD;
" We both must live for future purposes&#xD;
still. "&#xD;
"But can not this be avoided? Francis&#xD;
and my llrother are enemies I"&#xD;
"It is to cement their new union and&#xD;
peace, that this marriage is proposed.&#xD;
"And I must be the victim."&#xD;
"Dearest Eleanora, I will always remain&#xD;
at your side. Let that console you I"&#xD;
" Console me! Is not mine a fate like that&#xD;
of Tantalus ? Is not happiness always within&#xD;
my reach, and yet always eludes my grasp.&#xD;
I shall not marry France. I will resist to&#xD;
the last. Speak to me no more of it, Lio-&#xD;
nel."&#xD;
The noble was silent for a moment, then&#xD;
rising, took the queen's hand, and with&#xD;
graceful action led her back to the seat.&#xD;
"There is something else, I wished to&#xD;
speak to you of. The Prior di Castro is at&#xD;
open war with the king. His adherents are&#xD;
many. But they would melt away like love'&#xD;
before jealousy, were Juan to abolish the&#xD;
Inquisition. How much in mine and in my&#xD;

76&#xD;
&#xD;
THaE FATAL SEOlBT,&#xD;
&#xD;
people's interest it is that the Inquisition be&#xD;
abolished I need not tell you. Will not&#xD;
Queen Eleanora, whose influence over the&#xD;
king is so great, attempt to remove the hate-&#xD;
ful tribunal ?"&#xD;
" But, his holiness has sent the Cardinal&#xD;
Savelli, and my brother has recommended&#xD;
him in letters. Can Juan now abolish the&#xD;
Inquisition without offending both the Holy&#xD;
Father and the Emperor? Beside the aboli-&#xD;
tion of the holy tribunal will only conciliate&#xD;
the rebels, while its support will overpower&#xD;
and crush them."&#xD;
" To your first objections, Eleanora, let&#xD;
me reply, that I doubt whether Savelli's&#xD;
credentials, from the Pope, and your broth-&#xD;
er are genuine."&#xD;
"What I a Cardinal cheat, or even pre-&#xD;
sent false credentials ? Impossible."&#xD;
" So it might well seem. But I believe I&#xD;
have reasons for this suspicion. You know&#xD;
the Emperor's writing, as well as I do.&#xD;
Look I" and Don Lionel drew a parchment,&#xD;
heavy with seals from his pouch.&#xD;
The queen looked at it.&#xD;
"It does not look like my brother's sig-&#xD;
nature, but may still be it," she said.'&#xD;
"1I have no doubt that it is forged, but, in&#xD;
a little time, will be certain about it. Mean-&#xD;
while, Eleanora, while the Inquisition ex-&#xD;
ists, I am in constant danger of my life."&#xD;
" They dare not harm you. Should any&#xD;
mischance occur, I, the Queen, the Emper-&#xD;
or's sister, will step in and put a stop to the&#xD;
proceedings. Fear not, Lionel."&#xD;
"Oh, had I known that it would come to&#xD;
this; that you would be the bride of Francis&#xD;
at last, I would not have rejoiced at your&#xD;
rejection of Juan. Fool that I was, to think&#xD;
you would be left in peace, by the ambitious&#xD;
Emperor."         .&#xD;
"I am not the bride of the French king&#xD;
yet. That hateful diadem, which is my&#xD;
curse through life How happy could I&#xD;
have been, had I not been born a prin-&#xD;
cess. But being born so, I shall uphold the&#xD;
pride of my rank and name," continued the&#xD;
queen slowly; "Lionel, though I love you&#xD;
more than all else, I would father die than&#xD;
marry you I"&#xD;
Don Lionel's face Bushed. "1This," he&#xD;
&#xD;
said, "is the just feeling of your race and&#xD;
nation. , myself, could never Wed you,&#xD;
though you should leave the throne and the&#xD;
Church. The pure blood of David can only&#xD;
unite with a race equally ancient and no-&#xD;
ble."&#xD;
" Will you not," he continued, " use your&#xD;
influence upon Joan, to suspend, at least,&#xD;
the Inquisition for some time ?"&#xD;
"Will I possess any influence on him&#xD;
yet, when he hears of this French alliance '?"&#xD;
Don Lionel Dian reflected for some mo-&#xD;
ments, silently, on the position of things.&#xD;
Then he said:&#xD;
" The ambassador shall not arrive in three&#xD;
weeks yet. This will give me time enough&#xD;
to prove the documents of Savelli false."&#xD;
"Do you still think they are-forged ?"&#xD;
"Such is my belief; but 1 must be able to&#xD;
prove it."&#xD;
" Very well; I shall try my Uest to cause&#xD;
the suspension of the Inquisition, for a short&#xD;
time. This-I do merely for your sake, Lio.&#xD;
nel."&#xD;
" Thanks, beloved, thanks !" They em-&#xD;
braced.&#xD;
Thay still talked. and called up old memo-&#xD;
ries 5of beautiful Castile, and of the happy&#xD;
times, the pleasures, the joys, that had been&#xD;
their's in that romantic land. Alas! Portu-&#xD;
gal was not less fair than Castile, the Court&#xD;
of Lisbon not poorer in pleasures but Lio-&#xD;
nel and Eleanora were no longer young.&#xD;
He was no longer the handsome, brilliant,&#xD;
and imaginative page of eighteen; she no&#xD;
longer the child-princess of twelve. The&#xD;
poetry and romance that had occasioned&#xD;
their attachment had fled, but the love itself&#xD;
remained. Spring was    gone, and   the&#xD;
flowers faded, but fall found the fruits ripe,&#xD;
where blossoms had bloomed. Their love&#xD;
had grown stronger, as youth, romance and&#xD;
poetry fled. At first, it had been a love of&#xD;
'he imagination-now it was a love of reason.&#xD;
At first fancy had bound their souls, now&#xD;
philosophy chained it. Still the heart burn-&#xD;
ed with the same ardor yet, as when love&#xD;
first lighted it. For their love was pure; the&#xD;
fire was chaste as that of Vesta, and, there-&#xD;
fore, everlasting.&#xD;
Don Lionel Dian rose and bid the Queen&#xD;
&#xD;
"&#xD;
&#xD;
\&#xD;
&#xD;
-OR, PLOTs AND&#xD;
farewell. Again and again they embraced,&#xD;
and could not part.&#xD;
At last Eleanora wrapped her robe around&#xD;
her, and leaving a corn-ear of gold, like&#xD;
those she wore in her hair, in the hand of&#xD;
Don Lionel, disappeared.&#xD;
Don Lionel kissed the golden keepsake,&#xD;
and put it into his bosom; then extinguish-&#xD;
ing the lights, ho left this secret apartment,&#xD;
and ascending to the chapel, replaced the&#xD;
slab of stone, kicked some rubbish upon it,&#xD;
and returned to Lisbon.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
TUBEGIPSY 's DEMAND.&#xD;
We left Massor leaping through the window&#xD;
of Gloria's chamber, with the casket in his&#xD;
possession.&#xD;
?Tis the evening after Don Lionel's inter.&#xD;
view with Queen Eleanora of Portugal.&#xD;
We enter a smallapartment in the western&#xD;
wing of .the royal palace. Seated alone at&#xD;
a table covered with documents, is Juan.&#xD;
His plumed hat and jewelled sword are&#xD;
thrown carelessly aside. The king is evi-&#xD;
dently in deep meditation, for he does not&#xD;
notice the small but beautifully proportion-&#xD;
ed spaniel, that is violently tugging  at the&#xD;
lace of his boot. He speaks:&#xD;
" That my crown, aye, my very life should&#xD;
thus have been endangered, and the minis-&#xD;
ters of my council themselves among the&#xD;
foremost of the conspirators-and that base&#xD;
born-weed in the royal garden, the bastard&#xD;
offspring of my father's illicit love, as usual&#xD;
at the head. Holy MaryI defend us-and,by&#xD;
my right hand, I swear to plant my foot upon&#xD;
this Prior di Castro."&#xD;
He rose, and in his excitement struck the&#xD;
table with his clutched hand, to the evident&#xD;
astonishment of the spaniel, which slunk si-&#xD;
lently away at this signal of its master's&#xD;
wrath. After nervously pacing the roomI&#xD;
for a moment, Juan again resumed his seat&#xD;
and continued:&#xD;
"But, I have them in my power, and my&#xD;
new born minister, the Inquisition, shall&#xD;
destroy them, root and branch. The popeI&#xD;
shall excommunicate them my army -"&#xD;
A hand is laid upon his shoulder.&#xD;
He grasps his sword, and, half drawing&#xD;
&#xD;
COUXTE RPLois.                     77&#xD;
it, turns and confronts the intruder, exclaim.&#xD;
ing: "Wreteh! What hoI Guards I" His&#xD;
angry glance falls upon a man of herculean&#xD;
proportions, whose swarthy features and&#xD;
motley dress denote him a gipsy.&#xD;
It is Massor.&#xD;
"King!I you cry in vain, I have long since&#xD;
removed your guards," said the latter, in a&#xD;
contemptuous tone.&#xD;
"Who are you, that thus enters my cham-&#xD;
ber?"&#xD;
" Who am 1?" retorted Massor. "Like&#xD;
thyself, I am a King !'&#xD;
"A Gipsy chief t-A king?-Of cut-throats.&#xD;
Who gave thee entrance ?"&#xD;
- " Thou'lt learn, anon," significantly re-&#xD;
plied the gipsy. "'T is, perhaps, for thy&#xD;
own safety that I come."&#xD;
4 Ha!I What mean you ? explain or I&#xD;
summon my attendants to chastise thine inso-&#xD;
lence."&#xD;
"You may call and call again, still none&#xD;
will obey your summons. For the present&#xD;
at least, we are on an equality."&#xD;
" Once for all, state thy object here, or&#xD;
thou'lt be ejected."&#xD;
"And art still not convinced? Dost think&#xD;
that a Rommanni would trust himself in thy&#xD;
palace  without sufficient  precautions?&#xD;
HumphI King, you mistake my people."&#xD;
The King without deigning an answer,&#xD;
rang the call that lay upon the table.&#xD;
The sound died away unanswered.&#xD;
"It is indeed as you say. No matter.&#xD;
What purpose brings thee here ?"&#xD;
"Thy own safety, King."&#xD;
"Speak definitely, fellow."&#xD;
"I will. Thou hast introduced the In-&#xD;
quisition."&#xD;
"What of that," cried Juan, losing pa-&#xD;
tience.&#xD;
" All of that; it has been the cause of thy&#xD;
brother the Prior di Castro's revolt."&#xD;
" Aye and it will crush that revolt, too."&#xD;
"'T is easier said, than done."&#xD;
" The Cortes shall raise an army."&#xD;
"They already waver; they will declare&#xD;
for your brother, if-"&#xD;
" If-.&#xD;
"They but behold that which I h'ave to&#xD;
show them."&#xD;

' You ? Gipsy; and what have y'u that&#xD;
eo influence the Cortes.1'&#xD;
"These documents," replied Massor,draw-&#xD;
Ing the casket from his pouch.,&#xD;
By touching a spring, the bottom flew&#xD;
open and disclosed some papers laying with-&#xD;
in the cavity.,&#xD;
"Give them to me," said the King.&#xD;
"Excuse me, Senor, I can not trust you&#xD;
with them."&#xD;
In his rage the King bit his lip, so that&#xD;
the blood came.&#xD;
"What are they ?" he inquired in a voice&#xD;
hollow with rage and mortification.&#xD;
"The marriage testimonials of your father."&#xD;
" They are in the hands of our chan-&#xD;
aellors."&#xD;
"You mistake. They establish the mar-&#xD;
riage of the Duke di Braga with the lady di&#xD;
Castro,&#xD;
"Great Heavens I I do not understand."&#xD;
"Then I will speak plainer. They establish&#xD;
the marriage of your father with the Prior&#xD;
di Castro's mother. They establish the P0or&#xD;
di Castro's legitimacy and consequently his&#xD;
claim to the crown of Portugal,"&#xD;
The .King is paralyzed. Great beads of&#xD;
sweat stand upon his brow. Anguish fur-&#xD;
rows his features; his lips turn livid. Sud-&#xD;
denly !an electric thrill shoots through his&#xD;
body; his .eyes -dilate, and become white.&#xD;
He suddenly bounded forward and,with the&#xD;
fury of a madman, grasped at the documents&#xD;
in Massor's hands. But the gipsy was not&#xD;
unmindful of what was passing; his eye&#xD;
had, at a single glance, detected Juan's ob&#xD;
ject, and as the King thought to have the&#xD;
papers already in his possession, the strong&#xD;
arm of the Bohemian checked him in his&#xD;
course, and forcing him with herculean pow-&#xD;
er back into his seat, whispered:&#xD;
"In a combat of strength, I would be in&#xD;
the advantage, King ?"&#xD;
The-King unnerved and exhausted did&#xD;
not move, but remained pale and silently&#xD;
seated.&#xD;
-" In Heaven's name what do you wish ?"&#xD;
At length gasped out the astonished Juan.&#xD;
"I wish that, which you willfind it to&#xD;
your advantage to grant I" answered the&#xD;
gipsy.&#xD;

"And what is that?".inquired Juan.,&#xD;
"Hear me, King," continued Massor,"all.&#xD;
these papers, all th evidence of your broth-&#xD;

"Silence," interrupted  the Bohemian,&#xD;
"and do you think that I came for gold ?-&#xD;
No -Thank God, I am not what you take&#xD;

them,-what are they? dross, glittering&#xD;

"You are not a gipsy," said the king.&#xD;
"It is immaterial what I am," replied&#xD;
Massor, "I have come here for a certaiai&#xD;
purpose, determined to obtain it."&#xD;
" But," said the King, rising, "let us again&#xD;
start from the first point. You intend to&#xD;
force some concession or promise from me,&#xD;
by a threat to furnish my brother with the&#xD;
proofs of his legitimacy?"&#xD;
"It is: so, senor 1"&#xD;
"1 will not conceal from you, that I have&#xD;
heard of the existence of these proofs. But&#xD;
should I refuse to believe in their genuine-&#xD;
ness?1"&#xD;
"Then terrible facts shall attest to it.-&#xD;
The Cortes will depose you,thearmy of your&#xD;

"You deceive yourself, King. In the&#xD;

again these papers are not the genuine docu-&#xD;

The King was very pale, even greenish&#xD;
pale, and at the last words of Massor, a&#xD;
shade of disappointment stole over his eyes.&#xD;
Hertook the papers, however, and read&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"They confirm my worst suspicions,"&#xD;
said the King, returning them to Massor.&#xD;
"Reflect, oh King, on your present pasi-&#xD;
tiori. Rebels in the North,a dissatisfied peo-&#xD;
ple, an obstinate Cortes-your brother will&#xD;
grant everything I wish, for these papers-&#xD;

1 "I have heard enough," said Juan, "if you&#xD;
wish neither gold nor promotion, what then&#xD;
do you require."&#xD;
"You have established the Inquisition,&#xD;
not so much for the purpose of punishing&#xD;
malefactors, as to force others to the sameI&#xD;
religious beliefof which you are a disciple."'&#xD;
"Well!"I&#xD;
"You would make the faith of others&#xD;
subservient to your own, and, finding that&#xD;
you could not accomplish this by persuasion, t&#xD;
you will use force."            -&#xD;

-"Coicern youth a wanderer on the earth,t&#xD;

"Aye, it concerns, me," continued Mae- s&#xD;

the Countess Solani's, but not less fair.&#xD;
She holds a letter in her hands. Happy&#xD;

she reads, again and again, the words, over&#xD;
#which the earnest fire of his love has been&#xD;
poured.     .&#xD;

her gaze sweeps dreamily over te sunset&#xD;

Long had doubt filled her bosom, when&#xD;
Hernando and Enrique so suddenly disap-&#xD;
peared from Lisbon. Sharply had despair&#xD;
gnawed her heart, when it at last became&#xD;
known to her, as it became known to all Lis.&#xD;
bonj that Hernando and Enrique were im&#xD;
prisoned by the Inquisition.&#xD;
Before Enrique left Portugal, he had,&#xD;
through the agency of Father Domingo, sent&#xD;
an epistle to her whom his soul loved. This,&#xD;
together with the news that the brothers had&#xD;
escaped, swept a sea of sorrow from the&#xD;
maiden's heart And as should the seas be.&#xD;
displaced, treasures of pearls and gold wofild&#xD;
be found in their bed, at) Rosa retained one&#xD;
joyful knowledge from her great affliction.&#xD;
She knew now that Enrique was a secret&#xD;
Israelite!               -         -&#xD;
The family of Bananda had long been&#xD;
Israelites. But Rosa's mother was a Chris-&#xD;
tian. The gentle girl had been instructed&#xD;
in-her- faith by the relatives of her father.&#xD;
For several years past, she had endeavored&#xD;
to prevail on her mother to adopt the faith&#xD;
of her :husband and child. But not until&#xD;
lately had Donna Bananda consented to be-&#xD;
dome an Israelite;.-,&#xD;

brethren and sisters in faith.- The feast ,bf&#xD;
Passover was appointed, for that ceremony,&#xD;
and Donna Bananda had,therefore, still time&#xD;
to prepare herself during several months.&#xD;
The introduction of the Inquisition strength.&#xD;
ened Donna Bananda's resolution to become.&#xD;
an Israelite. For, great and just minds ire&#xD;

,things they have acknowledged as, truths, by&#xD;

Enrique had gone to Rome, and Rosa,&#xD;
imagined she saw him among the chur hes&#xD;
and palaces of -glorious Ro  t   ty of,&#xD;
Salvation. For, though a faithful  ebrew&#xD;
maiden, external custom and usage made&#xD;
Rome holy to her. Every one knows the&#xD;
force of custom and the strength with which&#xD;
it clings to us.&#xD;

the trees o'f the garden, a step was -heard,&#xD;
upon the stairs, and Miguel de Sousa stood&#xD;
at the side of his betrothed, Rosa di Banan.&#xD;

"Cousin, when did you return ?"&#xD;

-"4This is an improbable tale. You must&#xD;
state the truth."&#xD;
"I can not affirm any thing else, for that&#xD;
is the truth."&#xD;
"Then you maintain to have been the&#xD;
mistress of Enrique di Costa?"&#xD;
"No, holy Father! Our love was chaste&#xD;
and pure. I am no lewd woman. I de.&#xD;
serve every praise for so long resisting temp.&#xD;
tations, and-"&#xD;
"Take her back, " ordered the Cardinal.&#xD;
The truth of Margarita's statement, as far&#xD;
as could be, was ascertained, and the grey-&#xD;
headed chambermaid was sent back to her&#xD;
mistress.&#xD;
It is a few days after the return of Dame&#xD;
M rgarita to the summer pavilion.&#xD;
She is in the garden with a group of ser&#xD;
vants around.&#xD;
Margarita is repeating something that calls&#xD;
up agood many smiles fromthe younger part&#xD;
of her audience.&#xD;
"See this necklace of gold, worth at least&#xD;
a hundred broad pieces; this is a present&#xD;
from my lover! Ah I you may smile young&#xD;
ones, but it will be long ere you get as rich a&#xD;
lover as I have had. The day will come&#xD;
when Margarita Flunoz will be a lady. Yes&#xD;

plumed page I found in your room one&#xD;
night,-" Maria grew scarlet and ran away,&#xD;
"mine wears finer plumes and golden chains&#xD;

"And what is the name of your lover, ny&#xD;
fne dame?" inquired the jealous Matteo.&#xD;
-Nargarita's vanity would not let her con-&#xD;
cea it.&#xD;
"Enrique da Costa," she said loudly, "a&#xD;
1fir name, and a noble one."&#xD;
A middle aged man was just passing, and&#xD;
about to enter the summer pavilion.'&#xD;
It was Miguel di Sousa.   I&#xD;
He had informed himself, partly by bri-&#xD;
bing the servants, partly by conversation&#xD;
with Rosa's mother, who the lover of his be&#xD;
trothed was.&#xD;
He now heard this name mentioned, by&#xD;
an aged female servant to a crowd of other&#xD;
&#xD;
87&#xD;
&#xD;
'servants. He walked back slowly and heard&#xD;
her affirm:&#xD;
" Don Enrique abducted me, and him I&#xD;
expect to come -back and makeme aDonnal"&#xD;
" Don't be foolish, Margarita," said the&#xD;
footman Matteo.&#xD;
"Foolish? Is it you who are the greater&#xD;
fool, or I?"  Then remembering her digpi-&#xD;
ty, as the loved one of a noble, the dame&#xD;
added: "speak respectfully to your. superi-&#xD;
ore, Matteo."&#xD;
The poor footman's heart was breaking.&#xD;
Miguel di Sousa pulled Margarita by the&#xD;
sleeve.&#xD;
".Senora, I wish to have a talk with you,"&#xD;
he said.&#xD;
Margarita proudly tossed up her head to-&#xD;
wards her fellow servants, and said to Mi.&#xD;
guel, with a smirk and grin:&#xD;
"I am at your service, senor!"&#xD;
"I wish to talk to you alone, senora!"&#xD;
"Then follow me, senor!"  She led him&#xD;
to her apartment.&#xD;
" You spoke about one Enrique da Costa&#xD;
-is he your lover?"&#xD;
"If you please, senor, yes!  He loves&#xD;
me !"&#xD;
"Can you prove that?"&#xD;
"Well enough; for before he left Lisbon,&#xD;
he abducted me, and took me along."&#xD;
" Impossible!"&#xD;
"But it is possible, senor!"&#xD;
" What could a gay young noble want with&#xD;
an old hag like you!"&#xD;
"Senor, do you want to insult ne ?"&#xD;
"No, my good woman, " and he pressed&#xD;
several gold pieces into Margarita's palm.&#xD;
" What do you wish, senor," said the paci&#xD;
fled chambermaid, "I can not be untrue to&#xD;
my lover."&#xD;
" I do not wish you to. But I must have&#xD;
you do me a favor of a different kind."&#xD;
" What do you require, senor?"&#xD;
" There is a lady, a near relation of mine,&#xD;
to whom this perfidious Enrique, has been&#xD;
audacious enough to proffer vows of love."&#xD;
"What do you say, senor ? . Oh my&#xD;
heart!" and the poor maiden grew pale.&#xD;
" It is so, I assure you. Now, I wish to&#xD;

"Just after dusk. - I can trust you, senor!'&#xD;
"You caI    Farewell, till to-morrow&#xD;

'CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
(r. oRIA   A ND  DIEGO.&#xD;
The sentence-had been pronounced. Don&#xD;
Diego w#s doomed to death.&#xD;
-Kihg-had rejected every overture and&#xD;
offer, which the Duke di Asambuja had&#xD;
pade, and finally sent back the messenger&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, PLOTS AND COUNTERPLOTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
with these terms:: His Majesty, Joan the,&#xD;
Third, King of Portugal, will pardon the&#xD;
Duke di Asambuja, and, forgetting his past&#xD;
offences, allows him, to retain his dignities'&#xD;
and titles, on consideration that he immedi-&#xD;
ately disperse his people, and in no manner&#xD;
whatever continue to countenance or aid the.&#xD;
traitor, Antonio di Castro, '&#xD;
These terms were accepted, and the Duk.p&#xD;
hastened to town, to throw himself at the&#xD;
King's feet, and entreat a pardon forhis son.&#xD;
The Kingfhad coldly turned away from&#xD;
the Duke and dismissed him without an an-&#xD;
swer-&#xD;
The Duke, frantic with anxiety, clasped&#xD;
the King's knees, and conjured him to have&#xD;
mercy,&#xD;
Juan had wavered, and, moved by his o4&#xD;
servant's entreaties, promised to send an&#xD;
answer to him,before night.&#xD;
-The Duke had to be stisfied with this.&#xD;
Juan had then visited the Vountes di&#xD;
Voga, and, advised. and influenced by her,&#xD;
despatched to the Duke this answer:&#xD;
"The King, upon mature consideration,&#xD;
has thought best not to arrest the course of&#xD;
justice in this instance."&#xD;
The Countess had also requested an order&#xD;
for admittance to the prison of Don Diego,&#xD;
whieh.the King, although unwillingly, and&#xD;
with some hesitation, had granted.&#xD;
Nevertheless, on leaving Donna Gloria,&#xD;
hip majesty gave some orders about the exel&#xD;
cutton, the purport of which we will hereafter&#xD;
discover.&#xD;
The evening of the day before that, on&#xD;
which Don, Diego was to be executed, has'&#xD;
arrived.&#xD;
The sky was covered with intense black-&#xD;
ness; purplish and yellow vapors, like those&#xD;
of a conflagration, filled the air. Thretten-&#xD;
ingly muttered the faint thunder, and a&#xD;
dreadful calm, pressed like lead upon the&#xD;
earth. The leaves of, trees hung unmoved,&#xD;
and the waters of the Tagus and the sea&#xD;
presented a concave surface, so heavy was&#xD;
the compressed air. Not a flake of foam,&#xD;
curled around, the cliffs, so quiet was the&#xD;
sea.&#xD;
A wall of livid blackness advanced rapid-&#xD;
ly from the West, driving before it a long&#xD;
&#xD;
along by the gale, and thrown down upon&#xD;
habitations and houses, with tremendous&#xD;
force. The air was filled with clouds of&#xD;
minute spray, which, with the force of shot,&#xD;
beat against and broke windows and light&#xD;
structures. And, above all, was the deaf-&#xD;
ening roar of the storm and the sea. '&#xD;
The storms upon the Portuguese coasts&#xD;
are terrific. The winds sweep across the&#xD;
wide plain of the Atlantic ocean, the waves&#xD;
drive unappeased across thousands of miles&#xD;
of sea, and wind and waves spend their whole&#xD;
agcumulated force in chafing against the&#xD;
r ky bridle of Portugal. If lashed to fury,&#xD;
the reader will understand the power with&#xD;
which storms beat about that land.&#xD;
Suddenly a hoarse and rumbling uoise&#xD;
crept along the ground. The noise of&#xD;
the storm had aroused mother Earth. She&#xD;
shook and heaved in convulsive spasms.-&#xD;
The Earth quaked. In a moment, towers&#xD;
and steeples had - tumbled over. Whole&#xD;
villages were lifted by the soil on which&#xD;
they stood, and tossed into the river. Islands&#xD;
were buried beneath the waves. Hills sank&#xD;
and valleys became mountains. The storm&#xD;
howled with tenfold fury.&#xD;
Ships in the harbor were swallowed up.--&#xD;
The wharves disappeared beneath masses&#xD;
of foam. The sea ranged over the land, and&#xD;
created lakes where mountains had been.&#xD;
People prayed. Not a house in Lisbon,&#xD;
in which the inhabitants were not congre-&#xD;
gated in the cellars, and offered up prayers&#xD;
and supplications. Fear and anguish stir-&#xD;
red up every soul. Yet, in Liebon little harm&#xD;

&#xD;
line of snow white foam. It broke upon the&#xD;
cliffs. A sheet of blue fire rent th heav-&#xD;
ens. A,deafening crash of thunder shook&#xD;
the clouds. The storm had burst in all its&#xD;
fury upon the Portuguese coast.&#xD;
The seas broke loose. The waves lifted&#xD;
up their voice, and roared to the hissing yell&#xD;
of the wind. The beetling rocks were upheav.&#xD;
ed, and tossed aloft upon the head of the bil-&#xD;
lows. Again and again, crashes of thunder&#xD;
and hissing lightnings tore across the sky.&#xD;
The Tagus rose, and, with the fury of a sea,&#xD;
swept away, the inns and houses that garn-&#xD;
ished its banks. Uprooted trees were borne&#xD;
&#xD;
was done. The villages upon the coast suf-&#xD;
fered most.&#xD;
Toward twelve o'clock at night the storm&#xD;
subsided. The earthquake had but once&#xD;
shaken the ground and was gone.&#xD;
The air grew more quiet. The sea ceased&#xD;
its efforts, Yet the water tossed in dread-&#xD;
ful agitation still. The wind had whipi&#xD;
up its lowest sands and shells, and cast them&#xD;
upon the land, and it lashed wrathfully&#xD;
against the shore, in efforts to regain them.&#xD;
Then a window of the summer pavilion&#xD;
was opened, and Gloria looked out. '&#xD;
" The storm has subsided," she said, turn-&#xD;
ing to MarialFlunoz. "We willgo now."&#xD;
" For the Holy Saviour's sake, do not go.&#xD;
out on this dreadful night," cried Maria.'-&#xD;
" We will be crushed by falling chimneys&#xD;
and rafters."&#xD;
"I must see him, gi . If you do not ac-&#xD;
company me, I will   lone."         I&#xD;
" No, senora, if you go, Maria will pecom-&#xD;
pany you."&#xD;
"I hoped so; and now, Maria, since I&#xD;
know not what may be the events of this&#xD;
night, let me at any rate provide for your&#xD;
future."&#xD;
" Oh, Donna!"&#xD;
"Here is a necklace of pearls worth a&#xD;
small fortune. This will give you and Fi-&#xD;
daro the means of establishing yourself,&#xD;
when you marry."&#xD;
Marialhung her head.&#xD;
,Fidaro.loves me not."&#xD;
Yes, he does," said Gloria.  Do not&#xD;
distrust him, for he is myfriend."&#xD;
Maria took the pearls and, with tears of&#xD;
gratitude, kissed her mistress' hand.&#xD;
This was the only explanation in regard&#xD;
to Fidaro, that ever passed betweenthe lady&#xD;
and her chambermaid.&#xD;
"Now let us go, MariaI&#xD;
" Forgive me, lady. But, oh, go to-mor-&#xD;
row !"&#xD;
"To-night it must be; order the chair to&#xD;
be ready."&#xD;
Maria went out and told the servants.-&#xD;
Astonished at this freak of the Countess,&#xD;
they looked at each other: But Maria, re-&#xD;
peating the order,-it was quickly obeyed.&#xD;
Gloria then descended from her apart-&#xD;

ments., The Countess was wrapped in al&#xD;
large robe of black color, lined throughout&#xD;
with, fur. A heavy houd covered her head.&#xD;
.A clumsy kind of litter, or ,sedan chair,&#xD;
was held by four sable Africans. Six ser-&#xD;
vants bearing torches surrounded it. The&#xD;
sedan was covered with heavy gilding.&#xD;
Gloria motioned an upper servant, who&#xD;
was armed,to approach.&#xD;
Bear me to the Castle !" she said.&#xD;
He made a, silent obeisance, but his as-&#xD;
tonished eyes expressed the wonder, he dare&#xD;
not express audibly.&#xD;
Gloria, followed by her chambermaid,&#xD;
now entered the litter, and they were borne&#xD;
rapidly away.&#xD;
The wind extinguished the torches al-&#xD;
most immediately, and the rain, beginningg&#xD;
to pour, deluged the servants and litter&#xD;
bearers. Great streams of water gushed&#xD;
from the top and sides of the sedan, and&#xD;
even leaked through, here and there.&#xD;
At last they were before the Castle. The&#xD;
servants hailed the sentinel, but it was long&#xD;
ere their voices could be heard, above the&#xD;
shrill and mighty whistle of the wind.&#xD;
At last the soldier, who kept watch upon&#xD;
the wall, heard them, and asked:&#xD;
"Who is there ?"&#xD;
"The Countess di Voga!"&#xD;
"What does she want?"&#xD;
The servants looked at Gloria,&#xD;
"An express order. from his wrajesty, to&#xD;
see Don Diego di Azambuja; " she said,&#xD;
and the-servants repeated it, to the soldier.&#xD;
There was some shouting and noise, and&#xD;
at last the officer of the watch ascended the&#xD;
wall.&#xD;
The same questions were asked, and the&#xD;
Same answers given.&#xD;
"I will tell the governor," said the offi.&#xD;
cer.&#xD;
The governor was called.&#xD;
He hadbeen prepared for Gloria's visit.by&#xD;
a message, on the day previous, but had not&#xD;
expected her so late.&#xD;
The gates were opened and the train of&#xD;
the Countess admitted intosthe courtyard.&#xD;
The-, governor. inspected Gloria's order,&#xD;
and then led her into his own apartments.&#xD;
An, unusual.activity seemed to prevail in&#xD;
&#xD;
the castle at this late hour. Lights stream..&#xD;
ed from most of the windows, the soldiers&#xD;
were all assembled in their barrack: rooms,&#xD;
and the officers all awake and walking about&#xD;
in the great hall, talking in whispers.&#xD;
"Admit me to the prisoner, immediately,"&#xD;
she said.&#xD;
" As your excellency wishes," was the&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
And commanding two servants, they walk.&#xD;
ed before them, bearing torches, toward the&#xD;
prisons of the old Castle. Gloria, leaning on&#xD;
the governor's arm, followed.&#xD;
They came to the Western towers. Door&#xD;
after door was unlocked by the obsequious&#xD;
turnkey.           -&#xD;
" Your excellency wishes to see Don Die.&#xD;
go alone?" inquired the governor,&#xD;
"Alone! " replied Gloria.&#xD;
Another door was unlocked and they en-&#xD;
tdred the chapel of the castle, which,by this'&#xD;
way, communicated with the prisons, but&#xD;
could also be entered from the courtyard&#xD;
and great hall.&#xD;
Both the latter entrances were now, how.&#xD;
ever, securely closed.&#xD;
"The prisoner is at his prayers," whisper.&#xD;
ed the governor.&#xD;
The chapel was quite dark, except, near&#xD;
the altar, where foir torches shed a dim&#xD;
light over a gigantic cross of brass, before&#xD;
which two men kneeled. At their side, in&#xD;
his clerical robes, stood Father Marcus&#xD;
The governor signed to the priest. He&#xD;
approached.&#xD;
"This lady wishes to speak with Don Di-&#xD;
ego, alone."&#xD;
Marcus turned a scrutinising eye upon&#xD;
Gloria. She slightly lifted her hood.&#xD;
He recognized her.&#xD;
"Very well," said he. "But, lady, will&#xD;
you not hear me for a moment now? I&#xD;
have to ask you for something."&#xD;
Now?"&#xD;
"Yes, if you please. It will take but a'&#xD;
moment."&#xD;
The governor discreetly retired, with his&#xD;
attendants.&#xD;
" What is it then ?" inquired Gloria, half -&#xD;
vexed. "I owe you the granting of a favor.",&#xD;
"I will avail myself of it now. Lady,,Voa&#xD;

ined upon the floor of the dhapel, it never&#xD;
entered your mind that one day that pale&#xD;
girl should bow you to the earth ! that she&#xD;

shining like those of an angry tigress. Her&#xD;
breath came short.  A beautiful flake of&#xD;
foam hung upon her fresh, scrlet lips. A&#xD;
Goddess could not have ;been more beauti-&#xD;
ful than she was, at that moment.&#xD;
" Mercy !" cried the Duke, "mercy for&#xD;
my son! Ihave offendedyou; I have merited&#xD;
your anger; let me die, but save my son!&#xD;
save the prop of my house!"&#xD;
Gloria was exhausted. She replied not.&#xD;
"Oh, loria I" said  Don Diego, "your&#xD;
picture a ways dwelled in my heart. I-knew-&#xD;
naught of your fate, until qaite lately, and'&#xD;
then all inquiry vas met by the stern refu-&#xD;

my dying hour, when no earthly hand can&#xD;

me to the block!&#xD;
We are, emphatically, the creatures of&#xD;
impulse. Impulse has more to do with our&#xD;
decisions, than the much boasted of reason of&#xD;
man.&#xD;
Gloria was softened. In spite of her rea-&#xD;
sons to hate him, her m'ich desired revenge,&#xD;
the language of Don Diego, the dimly light.&#xD;
ed chapel, the fate impending over him, all&#xD;
exercised their influence on her. And in&#xD;
spite of the reproaches she had meditated,&#xD;
the taunts she had prepared, pity, perhaps,&#xD;
even resurrected love, now rose sweetly in&#xD;
her heart.&#xD;
"1Can it be so ? Do you love me still ?"&#xD;
His only reply was an embrace, which&#xD;
Gloria permitted.&#xD;
"Will you wed me, Diego?"&#xD;
"Am I At doomed to die ?   I can but&#xD;
bid you farewell!"&#xD;
"1But if 1 can save you?"&#xD;
"You are my wife, by the honor of a no-&#xD;

" For God's sake hasten, dear lady!"&#xD;
cried the Duke.&#xD;
"I go; Diego, I save you from death, that&#xD;
you may become my husband. Farewell I'&#xD;
One more embrace, in which both hearts&#xD;
gushed with the recollections of the love of&#xD;
golden youth, and Gloria, tearing herself&#xD;
away, ran without assuming her eloak, to the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
The governor hastened to open. She was&#xD;
conducted through halls and down stairca-&#xD;
ses to the court.&#xD;
This took considerable time, for the castle&#xD;
was large.&#xD;
When Gloria was about to enter her lit-&#xD;
ter, the bell of the chapel began to ring&#xD;
slowly.&#xD;
"What means this bell, my lord ? " in-&#xD;
quired the Countess, anxiously.&#xD;
"1I am not at liberty to disclose it, mad-&#xD;
am i"&#xD;
"I command you! " Then softly entreat-&#xD;
ing,   pray you, senor !"&#xD;
The governor approached and whispered:&#xD;
"The King wished to spare to a noble&#xD;
family like that of Azambuja, the disgrace&#xD;
of a public execution I"&#xD;
" And, for God's sake, senor, proceed!"&#xD;
almost screamed Gloria.&#xD;
" And ordered Don Diego to be executed&#xD;
during the night. This is the signal."&#xD;
With a cry of extreme anxiety, Gloria&#xD;
sank to the ground. But immediately she&#xD;
rose again, and ran swiftly back into the cas-&#xD;
tle. Up stairs, along passages, madly groan-&#xD;
iig, she ran into the chapel; it was empty.&#xD;
She heard voices; following their direc-&#xD;
tion, she entered another room. Light beam-&#xD;
ed through the door below. It opened upon&#xD;
a staircase of stone, that descended into a&#xD;
great hall.&#xD;
Gloria stood upon the upper landing of&#xD;
the staircase. Below were a crowd of sol-&#xD;
diers, a black scaffold in their midst,.a man&#xD;
upon the scaffold. A sword flashed inthe air,&#xD;
and with a dull noise fell Don Diego's head&#xD;
upon the stone floor. Streams of blood del-&#xD;
uged the hall.&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, PLoTs AND&#xD;
6loria, unconscious with terror, lost her&#xD;
balance, fell down, hung for a moment over&#xD;
the side of the unguarded banisterless land-&#xD;
ing, threw her arms wildly about, and fell&#xD;
down upon the stone floor at the side of&#xD;
Don Diego's head. The fall had fractured&#xD;
her scull in various places. She was dead.&#xD;
A dreadful silence reigned for a moment,only&#xD;
broken by the gushing murmurof blood.&#xD;
Then the Duke di Azambuja rose, threw&#xD;
his arms aloft, and laughed wildly. The&#xD;
events of the night had deranged his reason.&#xD;
He was insane.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
ROME.&#xD;
"Romaruitlsuisviribus!"*  She has fallen,&#xD;
but even in her grave, the memory of em'&#xD;
pire hangs over her.&#xD;
O 1 Queen, onthe seven hills, how beauti.&#xD;
ful art thou ! They could tear the crown of&#xD;
the world from thy brow, but they could not&#xD;
rob thee of the splendid wreath which the&#xD;
God of nature placed there. They could&#xD;
take the purple from thy shoulders, but&#xD;
could not banish the halo of art and poetry,&#xD;
in which thou art wrapped. They could take&#xD;
the sceptre from thy hand, but the fine arts&#xD;
rule still in thee.&#xD;
Three hills of the seven remain to Rome.&#xD;
The rest are dedicated to the memory-are&#xD;
the grave yard-of the World's Empress.-&#xD;
Many pillars of shining marble still raise&#xD;
their finely carved heads-but the roof they&#xD;
supported has fallen ! Many massive fa.&#xD;
cades still line the deserted streets-but&#xD;
the houses they fronted, are dus6 Triumph-&#xD;
al arches, and monuments of the heroes of&#xD;
the Empire look upon the ruins of their lov-&#xD;
ed city.&#xD;
And the yellow Tiber flows on, the flowers&#xD;
bloom and the trees green-what knows na-&#xD;
ture of the changes that pass over the des-&#xD;
tinies of men? And in the bright sunlight,&#xD;
and the soft moonshine, the spiritof ancient&#xD;
Rome wails amongst the gigantic ruins.&#xD;
Hernando and Enrique walked in the&#xD;
light of the setting sun, amongst these ruins.&#xD;
The elder brother with a face of proud ex-&#xD;
*Horace.&#xD;
&#xD;
CoUN TERPLoTs.                     93&#xD;
ultation, Enrique with a quiet and saddened&#xD;
flush upon his brow.&#xD;
" There is the grave of our proud enemy;&#xD;
of our destroyer 0' cried Hernando. " She&#xD;
did not die in her strength, in her glory, de-&#xD;
fended by heroes, mourned by prophets.-&#xD;
But lived to be old, dishonored, scoffed, scorn-&#xD;
ed, to be dragged through every quagmire&#xD;
of disgrace, to suffer all and every pain en-&#xD;
tailed by her sins and excesses. And her&#xD;
mis-begotten offspring, red Popedom, dances&#xD;
and laughs over her grave, dishonors her&#xD;
bones, scatters her dust to the winds! "&#xD;
" That is her reward! How dreadfully&#xD;
she suffered ere she died, how well she was&#xD;
punished, history tells.-That same history&#xD;
which records our continued existence-a&#xD;
type of our eternal life beyond the grave !"&#xD;
"I cannot rejoice, upon these ruins, over&#xD;
the fall of our enemy. The remnants are&#xD;
grand and melancholy. Rome may have&#xD;
been cruel, she was also great. Oh, how&#xD;
beautiful! Come, my brother, ,step updn&#xD;
this marble pedestal and look with me !"&#xD;
"1 hate these ruins, with their beauty and&#xD;
grandeur! From them went the order to&#xD;
destroy Jerusalem. These pillars bore the&#xD;
roof under which plans for our dispersion,&#xD;
were concocted. I would pollute them and&#xD;
grind them to dust, as I would throw dirt&#xD;
upon the grave of a cruel foe."&#xD;
Hernando, pressed by the heat, had ta-&#xD;
ken off his hat, and as he stood there with&#xD;
frowning brow, and wildly gleaming eyes,&#xD;
his mouth compressed and head thrown back,&#xD;
the scarlet light glowing upon his face and&#xD;
black glossy hair, an angel of vengeance&#xD;
seemed to have stepped from the earth and&#xD;
apostrophised the marble ruins. Above him,&#xD;
upon the pedestal, stood Enrique-beautiful.&#xD;
ly pale, with soft, pious eyes raised to heav-&#xD;
en, with light, sun-gilded hair hanging upon&#xD;
his white throat, like an angel of peace&#xD;
some from heaven. There could not be more&#xD;
difference in the person of these two broth-.&#xD;
ers, than in their character.&#xD;
Hernando, seeing that he was unheeded'&#xD;
by Enrique, also mounted the pedestal where-&#xD;
on his brother stood, and in a softer mood&#xD;
throwing his arm around Enrique's neck,&#xD;
looked around.&#xD;
&#xD;

94                        T  E FA T A&#xD;
The scene was superbly bright. Far in&#xD;
the west, folds of scarlet and golden clouds&#xD;
hung around the flaming sun.&#xD;
The soft, richly tinted light 'flooded over&#xD;
the dreamy Italian view, and pouring a&#xD;
heavenly glory upon the marble palaces and&#xD;
gilded steeples of proud Rome, fell with a&#xD;
saddened glow upon the ruins beyond.&#xD;
Wtth its battlements clearly defined&#xD;
against the scarlet and azure air, stood the&#xD;
castle of San Angelo. The marble statue of&#xD;
agigantic angel, which surmounts it, seem-&#xD;
ed just alighted from the clear sky above.-&#xD;
St. Peter's lifted its dome, rich, fanciful, and&#xD;
majestic to the clouds. No edifice, perhaps,'&#xD;
impresses the beholder more with a feeling&#xD;
of awe and devotion, than St. Peter's&#xD;
church. There, architecture speaks in a lan-&#xD;
guage of power, that fails not to be beard in&#xD;
the heart.. Near it the splendid Vatican, on&#xD;
every side, the thousand glorious churches&#xD;
with Grecian pillars, Roman ornaments and&#xD;
Gothic arches, with marble and gilded stee-&#xD;
ples, pointing aloft; the basilicas with their.&#xD;
odd vaults, the pillars, gigantic statues, and&#xD;
the millions of objects that can not be grasp-&#xD;
ed at once by the eye of man.&#xD;
Behind, the remains of the old city, the&#xD;
Coliseum, the temples, the theatres, the bous-&#xD;
es, often with the broken pillars of the peri'&#xD;
tyle still erect, with the arrow vesibula&#xD;
still leading into the atrium, long no more,&#xD;
with the defaced remains of the Lares, or&#xD;
household gods, amongst the ruins, where&#xD;
they were adored, and which they were de-&#xD;
signed to protect. Oh how sadly fell the&#xD;
light upon the latter.&#xD;
This picture, which we have endeavored&#xD;
to bring before the mind of the readers, as&#xD;
it was before Enrique and Hernando's&#xD;
eyes, was surrounded and varied with the&#xD;
pearly foliage of Italian trees and woods.&#xD;
The brothers were unspeakably softened&#xD;
by the view. Rernando's face was serene,&#xD;
until his eye lighted upon a dark spot near&#xD;
the Tiber.&#xD;
"Ah," he cried, frowning, "and amidst&#xD;
"this beautiful view, a ghetto, a place of filth,&#xD;
darkness and abomination is provided foi&#xD;
the Jew! Look you there, my brother, and&#xD;
see the drop of poison in this large cup o&#xD;
beauty !" and he pointed to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
L MaC RET,&#xD;
Well it was for the brothers, that they&#xD;
conversed in Portuguese. For, not far from&#xD;
them, behind a ruin, sat an humble servant&#xD;
of the church.&#xD;
All at once, every church seemed to have&#xD;
opened its mouth, and the thousand tongues,&#xD;
of Rome, the sweet bells, poured the melody&#xD;
of their voices upon the evening air.&#xD;
"Come, brother," said Hernando, "we&#xD;
are soon to have our private audience; let&#xD;
us go home and prepare."&#xD;
The two brothers went, arm in arm, from&#xD;
the ruins into the city. They walked to the&#xD;
palace of Monsignore Mezzani, who was&#xD;
their host. The Cardinal Mezzani was him.&#xD;
self an Israelite, and, therefore, best suited,&#xD;
by his inclinations as -*ell as by the favor&#xD;
he enjoyed with the Pope, to further the ob-&#xD;
jects of the brothers.,s&#xD;
"Prepare yourself," said the Cardinal, a&#xD;
venerable old man with a long, black gown&#xD;
and scull cap; "the Holy Father has inform'&#xD;
ed me, that he will see you at dusk. Every&#xD;
. moment you may expect a message." '&#xD;
"Do you not accompany us, Father?"&#xD;
"No, my sonI Have you the presents&#xD;
ready ? They are of prime importance."&#xD;
"We have," replied Hernando.&#xD;
The brothers returned to their apartments,&#xD;
to attire themselves properly.&#xD;
They were soon notified that a papal at-&#xD;
tendant had arrived.&#xD;
Under his guidance they proceeded to the&#xD;
Vatican.&#xD;
First rode the papal officer. Upon his&#xD;
velvet jerkin were the arms of the Holy See.&#xD;
lin glitteringgold. Then followed llernan-&#xD;
do and Enriqu richly attired in velvet and&#xD;
satin. Behind them rode ten servants, in&#xD;
gorgeous- livery, each bearing a stout well&#xD;
'8 0&#xD;
filled bag,splendidly embroidered.  The&#xD;
bags contained. five thousand heavy gold&#xD;
Pieces each.&#xD;
,In two fihes, so as to enclose the money&#xD;
bearers, arched about thirty papal soldiers.&#xD;
t They were designed, partly as a protdction&#xD;
to the treasure, partly as a guard of honor.&#xD;
r   In this order the brothers arrived at the&#xD;

OR, PLOTS AND COUNT.ERPLOTS.       95&#xD;
&#xD;
were forthwith led into the presence of the&#xD;
Pope.&#xD;
The Holy Father sat upon an elevated&#xD;
chair, at the end of one of those apartments,&#xD;
made immortal by the pencil of Italy's mas-&#xD;
ter painters.&#xD;
Clement VIII was an old man of com-&#xD;
manding presence. The proud beauty, so-&#xD;
peculiar to the princely house of Medici,&#xD;
still lingered upon his features. But age&#xD;
had softened that outline of almost sculptur-&#xD;
ed exactness, had washed away the delicacy&#xD;
of the proportions, and blanched the&#xD;
haughty brow. A velvet scull-cap, lined&#xD;
with fur, covered his head. He was clad in&#xD;
a long, black tunic, with a broad scarf&#xD;
around his waist. A cape, or a mantle of&#xD;
velvet, lined with fur, was fastened in front,&#xD;
and hung over his shoulders to the hips.-&#xD;
The sleeves of his tunic were wide, and em-&#xD;
broidered with lace.0&#xD;
His dress was in many places ornamented&#xD;
with crosses. Upon the high back of his&#xD;
chair were carved, in wood and gilded, the&#xD;
papal arms-the tiara and keys. They were&#xD;
also embroidered upon the cushion serving&#xD;
as a stool- Tassels of seed pearls adorned&#xD;
that cushion at the corners.&#xD;
Hernando and Enrique knelt, and kissed&#xD;
the cross, which was embroidered upon the&#xD;
slipper of his Holiness.&#xD;
" Benedicite, meiflii," said his Holiness,&#xD;
ima full, impressive voice.&#xD;
" What is your errand to the Holy See?"&#xD;
"We are humbly commissioned by the&#xD;
New Christians of Portugal, to present these&#xD;
monies to the treasury of the Church;" said&#xD;
.Hernando, and with a slight backward mo.&#xD;
tion of his hand, he pointed to the bags of&#xD;
doubloons, which had been placed by the&#xD;
bearers in the lower part of the hall.&#xD;
"It is a payment for 'indulgencies, as we&#xD;
have committed many sins."&#xD;
*'We hope that you repent of them, mio&#xD;
caro."&#xD;
- Assuredly. Do St. Peterfind St. Paul par-&#xD;
don the sins of us misguided mortals?"&#xD;
"We will pray for you,and thus assure gra.&#xD;
clam coeli, divine pardon. in nomine Patri,&#xD;
flii et spi ritus sancti, I absolve ye, as repre.&#xD;
sentatives of the New Christians, in Portu-&#xD;
gal! ' May your sins be struck out from the&#xD;
&#xD;
book of St. Peter and St. PaulI " and each&#xD;
of the brothers kneeling, the Pontiff slightly&#xD;
raised his hand, and said to each separately:&#xD;
" Absolve teI"&#xD;
The brothers bent low their heads; as the&#xD;
redeeming words were pronounced by the&#xD;
Head of the Church.&#xD;
The Holy Father rose. Cardinal Mezzani&#xD;
then motioned to the brothers who, with low&#xD;
reverence, went backward out of the hall.-&#xD;
A papal secretary was in waiting.   He&#xD;
handed them the written absolution of the&#xD;
Pontiff. It was signed by Clement and seal-&#xD;
ed with the arms of theHoly See.&#xD;
The brothers returned to the house of the&#xD;
Cardinal and, having now executed their&#xD;
mission, prepared to return.&#xD;
Yet there was one more secret mission,&#xD;
which they had been ordered to perform.&#xD;
It was concerning the Cardinal Savelli.-&#xD;
They had procured assurances from the&#xD;
highest sources, that Savelli had never been&#xD;
sent to Portugal, that he was no Cardinal,&#xD;
that his documents were forged.&#xD;
S'the fetters of Pater Domingo were deliv-&#xD;
ered to the Cardinal, who returned to the&#xD;
brothers the written assurance of his Holi-&#xD;
ness, that Savelli was an impostor.&#xD;
The brothers had also received epistles to&#xD;
the Inquisitor General of Spain, in which&#xD;
his spiritual superiors exhorted him to ar-&#xD;
rest and condemn the mAn who forged a&#xD;
Cardinal's title, and assumed an office not&#xD;
given him by the Holy See.&#xD;
The written assurance of the Pontiff was&#xD;
couched in these words:&#xD;
We hereby inform our well-beloved son,&#xD;
Juan of Portugal, that the priest Savelli pose&#xD;
sesses no authority from our hand to act, a&#xD;
we have been informed he does.&#xD;
CLEMENTT"&#xD;
The other letters were more explicit, and&#xD;
urged the peculiar crime of Savelli, and hia&#xD;
speedy deposition and punishment.&#xD;
Ere many days had passed, the brothers&#xD;
were safely embarked on board of the same&#xD;
Dutch vessel. The wind was fair,pnd the *&#xD;
sunny shores of Italy vanished in the dis-&#xD;
tance, concealed by a haze of azure e nd&#xD;
gold.&#xD;

Margarita, true to her appointment, awaited&#xD;
Don Miguel di Sousa in the rear of the pa.&#xD;
vision, as dusk began to pour a tinge of lu.&#xD;
cid obscurity over the sky, and the air.  da&#xD;
She was attired in a silken robe, belong- p&#xD;
ing to the Countess di Solani. A plumed an&#xD;
gear covered her head,and a black mask con- Cc&#xD;
sealed her features.  A scarf of Indian a&#xD;
muslin hung over her shoulders.        c&#xD;
It was night ere Don Miguel arrived.&#xD;
"I have waited long," began the: impa- kt&#xD;
tient Margarita.,a&#xD;
"I could not come sooner," replied Don&#xD;
Miguel. "A  few streets distant a litter b&#xD;
awaits you, dame."&#xD;
He took her hand and led her alongin&#xD;
w&#xD;
such a gallant style, that the old lady's heart at&#xD;
beat high, and she stepped as daintily and&#xD;
briskly, as a maiden of eighteen.     li&#xD;
The litter was reached, and the dame en- o&#xD;
tered it. Miguel mounted a horse and rode&#xD;
behind, directing the slaves, where to bear it. s&#xD;
Safely arrived at Belem, it was set dowe y4&#xD;
a'u the inn of St. Ignatio, and the good dame, i&#xD;
under the guidance of the noble, entered&#xD;
the palace of Donna Bananda, and the apart- y&#xD;
ments of Rosa.&#xD;
Rosa lay upon a low couch, covered wit h&#xD;
bright colored cloth of Indian manufacture. I&#xD;
From the ceiling depended a silver lamp,&#xD;
filled with perfumed oil.*t&#xD;
The young lady seemed unconscious of h&#xD;
the entrance of her betrothed and the dame.&#xD;
Her face was buried in her hands, and the9&#xD;
long, glossy hair, being loosened by her agi- n&#xD;
tation, fell in many masses around her. 1&#xD;
"Speak softly,' whispered Miguel to hisd&#xD;
companion. Then approaching Iosa, he&#xD;
endeavored to take her hand, and said:&#xD;
"My dear, why do you grieve? These t&#xD;
young gallants are but triflers, and delights&#xD;
to flirt, that they may boast of a lady's fa-&#xD;
vor, to their drinking companions. I knew&#xD;

"Can this be so? who are you ?"&#xD;
"The lady wishes not her name to be&#xD;
known, but she is of very high condition,"&#xD;
gain observed Miguel.&#xD;
" Enrique da Costa, on flying from Lis-&#xD;
on, was accompanied by this lady."&#xD;
" Indeed," Margarita continued, " his love&#xD;
as so violent, that almost involuntarily he&#xD;
abducted mq."&#xD;
" It is all a fabrication! I will not be'&#xD;

The ladies rose and walked along the&#xD;
sombre, darkened paths, all over arched by&#xD;
trembling foliage. Now, they reached the&#xD;
house, and turning, looked upon the glowing&#xD;
stars.  The whispering wind  did creep&#xD;
around the trunks of aged trees, and whistle&#xD;
through the knots. They went into the silent&#xD;
house. Then from beneath the brownish&#xD;
trunks that rose in bosquets, and in silent&#xD;
clumps aloft around the arbor, where the&#xD;
ladies sat, a figure stole. It was a man whose&#xD;
face, all bitter with the wicked though ts&#xD;
within, was lifted to the pure and starlit&#xD;
sky. The moon, with trembling beams, did&#xD;
gleam upon the figure and the face. But&#xD;
burning bright with selfevolved rays the&#xD;
eyes did shine, and shed a beam of hell upon&#xD;
the face. 'T was Miguel di Sousa; he had&#xD;
heard the trustful conversation of the child&#xD;
and mother. He then knew well that ne'er,&#xD;
with Donna -Bananda's word, he could ac-&#xD;
complish his purpose. His heart was&#xD;
pressed with grief, and from its secret&#xD;
chamber flew the dormant poison. What&#xD;
schemes and plans then sprang to life, the rea-&#xD;
der will only see as executed by that revenge-&#xD;
ful man, whose soul was bent on wedding&#xD;
Rosa.&#xD;
The morning after Rosa's confession to&#xD;
her mother, Don Miguel di Sousa reclined&#xD;
on the cushions of a two oared barge, which&#xD;
was being rowed toward a large three mashed&#xD;
vessel.  In letters of gold was painted&#xD;
around the figurehead, the vessel's name,&#xD;
"St. Pedro di Alvendi."&#xD;

Don Miguel was put on board, and there&#xD;
received by a thin weasel-faced man, who&#xD;
was the captain.&#xD;
" How are you, old friend.!" cried Don&#xD;
Miguel, with a heartiness, which was re-&#xD;
turned in part, by the weasel-faced one.&#xD;
"Well, well! I am quite well, but wish&#xD;
to be at sea again."&#xD;
"Oh, Misardo, always wishing to lie&#xD;
on the broad ocean."&#xD;
" Yes; 't is too expensive to live on land.&#xD;
My heart always burns, when they roar&#xD;
land from the masthead. I do n't like it."&#xD;
"My old water dog, I should think you&#xD;
would like, once in a while, to see your.&#xD;
relatives again."&#xD;
"No, no, I have none! so help me St.&#xD;
Pedro; none, but a few rascally starvelings,&#xD;
who want to rob me of my well-earned&#xD;
savings; not that I have much !"&#xD;
Miguel replied by what is termed, at&#xD;
the present time, "a wink," which said&#xD;
plainer than words could express it:&#xD;
"I know you, old miser."&#xD;
"Nay, nay," again said Captain Misardo,&#xD;
uneasily, " I possess nothing. But when&#xD;
land is in sight, I know the next thing want-&#xD;
ed will be pay for the sailors - the scamps."&#xD;
"Well, they earn it, pretty hard."&#xD;
"And spend it easy; a sailor throws&#xD;
away more in day on shore, than their cap-&#xD;
tain expends in a week."&#xD;
" I dare say. Bet let us go into the cabin&#xD;
where I will thank you for a draught from&#xD;
your best. I have business with you," con&#xD;
tinued the noble as they entered the cabin.&#xD;
" Business," said old Misardo, stopping,&#xD;
"I have no money, and can't lend any.-&#xD;
People fancy me rich, but St. Pedro knows&#xD;
that I am a beggar; a ruined beggar."&#xD;
"Be not afraid. I do not want money."&#xD;
Misardo drew a sigh of relief.&#xD;
" What else then," said he, placing a&#xD;
cup for his guest.&#xD;
" Are you sure there is no listener near,"&#xD;
said Miguel, looking around anxiously.&#xD;
"No. Why you surprise me. What is&#xD;
is you want with me ?&#xD;
Miguel was silent for a few moments.&#xD;
" What is it that you want?" inquired&#xD;
Captain Misardo, growing pale.&#xD;

"It is arranged that I wed her in a month&#xD;

"If you need any money for the wedding,&#xD;

in Misardo, "for I hold a certain sum in&#xD;

The captain was silent.&#xD;
"Well," continued Miguel, "as I said, all&#xD;
is arranged. Now, at once, the girl refuses&#xD;
to marry me."&#xD;
"I don't think I can let you have any&#xD;
money, for I hold it but in trust, and 't&#xD;
would be unlawful to do business with it."&#xD;
Miguel lifted up the glassen pitcher, that&#xD;
stood upon the table of the cabin, and threw&#xD;
it at Misardo's head. The weasel-faced one&#xD;
dodged, and thus eluded the blow. The&#xD;
&#xD;
Ir SECRET,&#xD;
vessel was shivered to fragments, on the&#xD;
wall.&#xD;
" It cost a quarter of a dobla, and was&#xD;
worth two! Do you think I am a spend-&#xD;
thrift, who throws his money out of the win.&#xD;
dow ?" inquired Misardo, angrily.&#xD;
" Calm down, my magnificent captain,&#xD;
and let us continue. Let me see, where did&#xD;
I stop ?",&#xD;
"That I could not lend you any money."&#xD;
Miguel looked about and would  rtainly&#xD;
have thrown something else at Misardo,&#xD;
had there been any convenient missile&#xD;
within reach; as it was, he contented himself&#xD;
with a furious glance, and then continued:'&#xD;
" The girl does. not love me, she says;&#xD;
now, you know well enough that love always&#xD;
follows marriage. Therefore, it is evident I&#xD;
must marry her first.- But, all of late, thre&#xD;
mother hag taken side with the girl, so that&#xD;
I am fairly cast off, and am politely told&#xD;
that the intentions of the bride will prevent&#xD;
the consummation of the nuptials. All&#xD;
previous arrangements are broken ol."-&#xD;
Miguel's features worked and writhed, while&#xD;
thus relating his hopeless prospects.&#xD;
"A great loss, a great loss!" murmured&#xD;
Misardo. " She is immensely rich."&#xD;
" And I am ruined, if I can nt get hold&#xD;
of her fortune. My slight savings melted&#xD;
away in England."&#xD;
" Dreadful," said Misado, growing pale;&#xD;
"I am not able to aid you, for I am poor.&#xD;
Apply to the king for help."&#xD;
Another furious glance at Misardo.&#xD;
"No, no; I must marry her, and you&#xD;
must aid me to do it."&#xD;
"1I? how?"   inquired the  astonished&#xD;
Misardo.&#xD;
" You see, my friel," began Miguel,&#xD;
"when once married, the fortune of Donna&#xD;
Bananda is in my grasp."&#xD;
"True; you will be immensely rich."&#xD;
"Now, the difficulty is to get married.-&#xD;
To get over that difficulty I must have a&#xD;
willing bride, and a priest. The bride [&#xD;
have, but an unwilling one. Therefore, the&#xD;
first thing is to make her willing.''&#xD;
"How can I help you, in this ? I am&#xD;
not suited to coax theinind of ladies."&#xD;
"I should think not. But to get her con.-&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, 'LoTS AND&#xD;
sent, I must have her entirely under my&#xD;
influence. I can not exert any influence&#xD;
on her at home."&#xD;
"Therefore, you must get her away."&#xD;
"Splendidly reasoned, capitano mio. I&#xD;
mustget her away. And, here comes the point&#xD;
concerning you. There is no place in the&#xD;
world, where I can exercise such control&#xD;
upon her, as in your ship, on a voyage&#xD;
to Sicily."&#xD;
&#xD;
" In my ship? It will be too expensive&#xD;
to keep a lady. No, no, that would not do."&#xD;
"I will bear every expense, and besides,&#xD;
if all goes, as I .wish it, if my plans succeed,&#xD;
five hundred -- five hundred gold pieces are&#xD;
yours."&#xD;
"Five hundred ?"&#xD;
" I have said it. Well, are you dumb ?"&#xD;
" Five hundred gold pieces! and the&#xD;
expenses! I will do it, my noble friend,&#xD;
my rich patron."&#xD;
"Very well. Now, when do you sail for&#xD;
Sicily? Start as soon as possible."&#xD;
"Day after to-morrow, I can be ready."&#xD;
"But, could I have some of your sailors&#xD;
if necessary, to carry her off?"&#xD;
"Yes.   So there is no danger.  But,&#xD;
where will you get a priest ?"&#xD;
" That, indeed ? I must see to."&#xD;
"My brother is a priest," said Misardo,&#xD;
"if youpay him well, he will go along."&#xD;
" Will you manage it? Explain every-&#xD;
thing, and have him on board. Can you&#xD;
do it?&#xD;
" How much do you authorize me to offer&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
" Fifty pieces."&#xD;
"'That willinot be enough. Say a hun-&#xD;
dred pieces, at least."&#xD;
" A hundred, then. Now, all is arranged.&#xD;
The priest will be here, and, go along with&#xD;
us b Sicily.  To-morrow  afternoon, have&#xD;
some of your sailors ready to accompany&#xD;
me. At night, I think we can bring the&#xD;
golden bird a captive on board, and in the&#xD;
morning the ship weighs anchor. Oh !&#xD;
Rosa, you shall see that Miguel di Sousa is&#xD;
a man, that can not be thwarted in his pur-&#xD;
poses. You will think different about re-&#xD;
jecting me, when once on board of this ship !&#xD;
We shall have you, my fine lady !"&#xD;
&#xD;
OoUNTURPLoTS.                    101&#xD;
" I really admire you," said the little cap.&#xD;
e tain.&#xD;
After some furtl-er arrangements, con.&#xD;
cerning the carrying out of Miguel's plan,&#xD;
the nobleman departed from worthy Misardo,&#xD;
and was rowed back.&#xD;
"Ah," he thought, "if our king had&#xD;
not, all at once, God knows for what reason,&#xD;
suspended the action of the Inquisition, and&#xD;
for an indefinite time too,'things would look&#xD;
different.  Then, Donna Bananda would&#xD;
tremble and entreat, when.now, she disdain-&#xD;
fully turns her head. Ah, that measure&#xD;
was a great blow, for me. If the Inquisition&#xD;
were only in action."&#xD;
The sun shone gaily as Miguel, throwing&#xD;
a few coins to the rowers, jumped on shore,&#xD;
and ascended the steps leading to the ter-&#xD;
race, in front of the royal palace.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
 THE INSURGENTS IN TH E NORTH.&#xD;
IN a former chapter, the reader has seen&#xD;
that, at the request of Dun Lionel, Queen&#xD;
Eleonora resolved to intercede with Juan,&#xD;
in behalf of the Israelites concerning the&#xD;
suspension of the Inquisition. The entreaty&#xD;
of the Queen furnished the King with a&#xD;
most reasonable excuse to fulfil the promise&#xD;
Massor had extorted from him.&#xD;
After the Gipsy's visit, Juan had em-&#xD;
ployed the most expert spies to dog the&#xD;
steps of him who had in his possession the&#xD;
FATAL SEenET, that could eventually ieer the&#xD;
crownfrom his brow, and wrench the sceptre&#xD;
from his grasp. But in vain. None of all&#xD;
those employed were able to trace him&#xD;
further than some by-street in the neighbor-&#xD;
hood of the palace. It is true that, for once,&#xD;
Don Antonio, the prime minister,,with his&#xD;
suite. passing by the Episcopal palace,&#xD;
where the Cardinal Savelli dwelt, thought&#xD;
that he had seen Massor standing in the&#xD;
entrance, but quieted his mind , the re-&#xD;
flection how impossible it was for t Gipsy&#xD;
to be so near the'head-quarters of the In-&#xD;
quisition, without detection, and, therefore,&#xD;
took no further note of the fact,&#xD;
Great, indeed, was the joy of the Israel-&#xD;
ites, when the suspension of the Inquisition&#xD;
was proclaimed, and proportionately great&#xD;

the cave, when the sun rises."&#xD;
"But, where shall we conceal ourselves?"&#xD;
inquired one of the men.&#xD;
"In yon clumps of trees behind the&#xD;
castle," replied Massor, and the men&#xD;
obeyed him.&#xD;
Then the gipsy chief and Fidaro crept&#xD;
under cover of the trees, that lined  the&#xD;
high road close to the tents of the Prior's&#xD;
camp. Sentinels were posted, within call of&#xD;
each other, all around.&#xD;
They approached one of them who guard-&#xD;
ed a pobtern gate. The sentinel went up and&#xD;
down before the narrow gate that led through&#xD;
the wall of palisades, defending that part&#xD;
of the camp singing:&#xD;
"The lady gazed from the castle high,&#xD;
Upon the soldier boy below;&#xD;
Her face was pale, but in her eye&#xD;
The fires of love did glow.'*&#xD;
lassor approached in the shade of the&#xD;
palisades, untilohe almost stood in the corner&#xD;
formed by the jutting out of the postern at&#xD;
the side of the gate. It was impossible for&#xD;
any eye dazzled by the radiant moonshine&#xD;
to detect him in ,e black shadow. Fidaro&#xD;
stood behind hi -i&#xD;
"How, in S   uan's name, do you expect&#xD;
to enter the camp without detection ?" ques-&#xD;
tioned Fidar&#xD;
"Nothi g is impossible to one of my&#xD;
race," replied Massor, in a whisper. When&#xD;
the sentinel turned, both stood before him.&#xD;
He blow the match of his arquebuse, and&#xD;
raising 't towards the two, inquired:&#xD;
"Who is there ?"&#xD;
"Friends !" was the reply.&#xD;
" The password ?"&#xD;
esistance to the Usurper."&#xD;
The soldier put down his weapon, and&#xD;
said: Pass     .   .     .&#xD;
In a moment the two stood in the camp.&#xD;
They walked silently like ghosts through&#xD;
the camp, not in the broad regular streets&#xD;
but between the tents, and in a concealed&#xD;
manner unt'l they approached the clear&#xD;
space around the Prior di Castro's tent.&#xD;
Translated from the Portugnese.&#xD;
&#xD;
The tent leaned with the rear upon some&#xD;
trees that garnished the outer edge of the&#xD;
castle moat. Some of the branches over-&#xD;
hung the roof, and from amidst the green&#xD;
verdure waved the royal flag.   Soldiers&#xD;
formed a guard around. They-lay in listless&#xD;
attitudes, but very quietly, except ,a few&#xD;
that stood 'with weapons ready before the&#xD;
door of the tent. The moonshine slept upon.&#xD;
the tent, the resting soldiers, the sentinels&#xD;
and the camp.&#xD;
Massor and his companion by a round&#xD;
about way arrived at the rear of the tent.&#xD;
They had turned to the left and skirted the&#xD;
free space until they came to the moat.&#xD;
Massor halted for a moment and listened.&#xD;
Allwas quiet. Then, proceeding along the&#xD;
side of the moat, he reached a point directly&#xD;
in the rear of the Prior's tent. He now&#xD;
endeavored to pierce the darkness of shadow&#xD;
with his sharp eyes.&#xD;
"There is an uninterrupted line of trees&#xD;
from here to the tent," he said. "Will you&#xD;
not see, Fidaro, whether it is soV&#xD;
Fidaro without a word plunged into the&#xD;
shade.&#xD;
"Shall I do it," now soliloquised Massor,&#xD;
" shall I play false to the King ? He does&#xD;
not mean to be true or faithful to me; he&#xD;
does not intend to keep to his promises.&#xD;
But I have put confidence in his words;&#xD;
can I now withdraw it? Oh ! yes, my duty,&#xD;
my principles require it, I must make the&#xD;
best of the means which God placed at my&#xD;
disposal. After all, I only work for justice&#xD;
and right. I do not trust a King like Juan.&#xD;
He will break promises. But when de Castro&#xD;
has once promised, he never deserts his&#xD;
word. - Ah, but will he promise? - No, I&#xD;
am too well convinced that it is in vain. He&#xD;
will not promise this. Yet the inducements&#xD;
are immense. I can make or unmake him.&#xD;
Well, we will see; try, I must."&#xD;
" There is a straightline of trees, sir," re-&#xD;
ported Fidaro.&#xD;
" Then wait here until I call you," re-&#xD;
plied Massor, and began to climb the next&#xD;
tree with the agility of a cat.&#xD;
When he had arrived at that part, where&#xD;
the branches began to spread, he seized the&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
THE ROYAL SPIES,&#xD;
Some days have passed, since Massor cap&#xD;
tured tI e Prior di Castro, and we enter one&#xD;
of the royal apartments, where we find the&#xD;
rebel chief and the gipsy in the presence of&#xD;
the King. They had arrived the previous&#xD;
day, at the same time with father Domingo.&#xD;
The priest had seen the King immediately,&#xD;
and communicated the failure of his mission.&#xD;
We can now imagine Juan's asto dishment,&#xD;
when Don Antonio imparted to him the in-&#xD;
formation that the Prior di Castro was in&#xD;
Lisbon, ready to throw himself at his majes.&#xD;
ty's feet Permission was immediately grant&#xD;
ed, and the two brothers again stood face to&#xD;
face.&#xD;
The King, proudly kind and severe as he&#xD;
endeavored to be, could not prevent a smile&#xD;
of triumph from playing around his lips, and&#xD;
the Prior, knowing his safety lay in submis&#xD;
sion, controled the quick, bitter feeling that&#xD;
welled up in his heart, aud, kneeling, kissed&#xD;
Juan's hand.&#xD;
"So you have, at last, recognised your duty,&#xD;
senor?" inquired Juan, coldly.&#xD;
"I have been misled by intriguing men,&#xD;
my royal brother," replied the Prior hum-&#xD;
bly.&#xD;
"Misled? Children and fools are misled,&#xD;
but not men."&#xD;
The Prior's face flushed. He swallowed&#xD;
his anger, and said:&#xD;
"Your majesty pardons me?"&#xD;
"If you will be worthy of my pardon."&#xD;
"I will retire to the convent of St. Garcani."&#xD;
"It is too exposed. The castle of Lisbon&#xD;
is much more suitable."&#xD;
"Does your majesty look upon me as a pri-&#xD;
soner?"&#xD;
"On the contrary, we shall be happy to&#xD;
employ you in a station of trust. YQu will&#xD;
govern the castle-" the King was silent,for a&#xD;
moment, and the Prior looked at him in as&#xD;
tonishment, for this he had never hoped-&#xD;
"jointly, with the present governor," added&#xD;
the King.&#xD;
The Prior's eyes fell in disappointment.&#xD;
What ths King had said was, in other words&#xD;
a sentence of imprisonment. For though he&#xD;
should actually be instituted as governor of&#xD;
&#xD;
L S E C R E T,&#xD;
the castle, yet he would be closely confined to&#xD;
his own rooms there, and, though treated&#xD;
with respect, would neither. be allowed to&#xD;
move freely, nor to see his friends. His as-&#xD;
sociate, the present occupant, would in fact&#xD;
be governor of the castle, and jailor of him.&#xD;
self. He ventured a faint remonstrance.&#xD;
"I have religous duties to observe."&#xD;
"Since you have disregrarded your duties,&#xD;
as a subject, it will not harm you to neglect&#xD;
your priestly observances. But we can fur.&#xD;
nish you with scourges and bread and water,&#xD;
in the castle as well as in a convent."&#xD;
"I recommend myself to your mercy,&#xD;
senor.".&#xD;
The King turned away fromethe Prior&#xD;
and looking at Massor said:&#xD;
"So to you, I owe this triumph, I thought&#xD;
you were mine enemy."&#xD;
"I am your majesty's friend and servant'&#xD;
But zeal for your royal interests did not alone&#xD;
urge me to rob the rebels of their head, and&#xD;
to bring him to Lisbon."&#xD;
"I suppose not. You seem to have a pro-&#xD;
per regard for your own interests."&#xD;
"I never forget my interests, which in this&#xD;
case are also the interests of your majesty's&#xD;
people."&#xD;
The King frowned.&#xD;
"Let us discuss these matters alone. Call&#xD;
the captain of my guard!"&#xD;
The captain entered, and Juan addressed&#xD;
hir. "Take a strong guard and convey the&#xD;
Prior di Castro to the castle, as secretly as&#xD;
it can be done. I have already informed the&#xD;
governor of my wishes in regard to hin."&#xD;
The Prior arose, and in bitter scorn, took&#xD;
his sword and offered it to the captain.&#xD;
Don Antonio, who stood behind the royal&#xD;
chair immediately directed Juan's attention&#xD;
to this fact.&#xD;
It were, perhaps, as wall," said the King,&#xD;
in a whisper.&#xD;
"No sire, you would make the Pior pop-&#xD;
ular. His misfortune would excite compas-&#xD;
sion, and instead of annihilating his party,&#xD;
you would cause it to increase."&#xD;
"But what effect will this mild punish-&#xD;
ment have on the rebels and disaffected?"&#xD;
" tThey will think, the Prior has betrayed&#xD;
them, anddeserted his own cause. For yet&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
apparently reward him, though in reality il&#xD;
is imprisonment."&#xD;
The captain had already taken the Prior'&#xD;
sword, and was about to lead him away&#xD;
when Juan said:&#xD;
"Return his sword, to my brother. He is&#xD;
appointed governor of the castle. Have a&#xD;
care that you give him safe guidance through&#xD;
the streets, and leave him not until within&#xD;
the walls of'the castle. He has enemies and&#xD;
his safety is dear to us."&#xD;
With a bow the Prior replied to this&#xD;
mockery, and throwing his sword upon the&#xD;
floor left the apartment The captain, obe-&#xD;
dient to a sign of Don Antonio, picked it&#xD;
up, and followed the Prior.&#xD;
"Now, gipsy, I have fulfilled my promise&#xD;
to you, and I find you have been true to me.&#xD;
Complete what you have bogun, and deliver&#xD;
those documents into my hands."&#xD;
"When your majesty has not temporarily&#xD;
suspended, but totally abrogated the Inqui-&#xD;
sition."&#xD;
"It is very bold of you to broach this sub-&#xD;
jeet again. Very bold of you, even to appear&#xD;
before me."&#xD;
"Bold, perhaps, but I incur no danger.&#xD;
Those documents are a hostage for my safety."&#xD;
"But by your own act, you have rendered&#xD;
those papers 'iseless. The Prior's life is&#xD;
now in our hand."&#xD;
"You dare not murder him!"&#xD;
"Idare to be just!"&#xD;
"Let us talk plain. I have trusted in you.&#xD;
I have rendered you an important service.-&#xD;
I am about to give up to you the documents&#xD;
which constitute your brother dangerous.-&#xD;
I demand a reward."&#xD;
"Your claims are just, and rewarded you&#xD;
shall be."&#xD;
"I demand the abolishment of the Inqui.&#xD;
sition.'&#xD;
"For the delivery of those papers?"&#xD;
"And for my other services, in bringing&#xD;
the Prior, a prisoner to Lshon."&#xD;
Don Antonio whispered for a moment to&#xD;
the King.&#xD;
"Gipsy," said Juan, " the Inquisition is&#xD;
suspended. So it shall remain at present.&#xD;
If a week hence, I find it still necessary to&#xD;
gain possession of those papers, I will give&#xD;
up the Inquisition for them."&#xD;
&#xD;
II&#xD;
&#xD;
t   " Promise moe, that in either case the sus-&#xD;
pension of this tribunal shall last for two&#xD;
8 weeks yet."&#xD;
The King thought for a moment and then&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"I promise. Depart now gipsy, and a&#xD;
week from hence you shall know our answer.&#xD;
Meanwhile, thanks, for the Prior di Castro."&#xD;
Massor stood doubtingly, for some mo-&#xD;
ments, and then said:&#xD;
" May you be not unworthy of the trust I&#xD;
repose in you."&#xD;
Slowly he left the royal apartments.&#xD;
As he descended the great staircase, a&#xD;
bustle arose below, and presently appeared&#xD;
a hale and hearty man of dashing appearance&#xD;
and magnificently arrayed. A brilliant suite&#xD;
of cavaliers accompanied him. The guards&#xD;
saluted, and the master of ceremonies con-&#xD;
ducted them to the antechamber. of the&#xD;
throne room.&#xD;
It was the ambassador of the emperor,&#xD;
Ch arles V, to whom the King gave audience&#xD;
that day.&#xD;
In the antechamber they were detained&#xD;
for some time, and then with the loud an-&#xD;
nouncement of his titles, Senor, the ambas.&#xD;
saidor, was admitted. The King received&#xD;
him seated upon the throne.&#xD;
Let us follow Massor, who, waiting until&#xD;
the gorgeous throng was passed, inquired,&#xD;
with trembling eagerness, of one of the ush-&#xD;
ers, for what purpose the ambassador had&#xD;
audience. The usher silently looked at the&#xD;
gipsy, and then, without a word, passed on&#xD;
disdainfully. Massor suppressed his wrath,&#xD;
and hastened to the courtyard. There wait-&#xD;
ed, in gloriously gay medley, the servants of&#xD;
the ambassador's suite.  Ti e proud and&#xD;
beautiful horses champed their bridles, and&#xD;
moved impatiently. Massor began a con-&#xD;
versation with one of the servants and, by&#xD;
lint of soft replies to rough jokes, brought&#xD;
the men to speak of the ambassador.&#xD;
" Why," said the servant, "you must&#xD;
have been abroad or slept, for the last week.&#xD;
All Lisbon talks of this matter. Queen El-&#xD;
eanora&#xD;
" Queen EleanoralI What about her?"&#xD;
" Why, she marries the brave King of&#xD;
the French, and nothing else. That's why&#xD;

we came all the way from Valladolid to Lis-&#xD;
bon, and that's why we are here, this morn-&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
The gipsy said nothing. but abruptly pass.&#xD;
ed on out of the precincts of the palace, and&#xD;
into the city.&#xD;
"This is no news to me," he thought,&#xD;
"and yet it pains me so much. I have nev.&#xD;
er looked at her but as the wife of&#xD;
Good heaven! Will this torture never end ?&#xD;
Always, always Tantalus yearning for the&#xD;
fruit. diving for the water, and always the&#xD;
fruit out of his reach, the water driven from&#xD;
his tongue! Great God! shall my whole life&#xD;
fNll sacrifice to vain efforts ?"&#xD;
An expression of intense agony distorted&#xD;
Massor's features, as he half r.urmurred&#xD;
these cries of a wrung heart. Even the two&#xD;
men, who, sent by the King, followed his&#xD;
wild and careless steps, felt a kind of com-&#xD;
passionate fear, and increased the distance&#xD;
between themselves and the evidently suf.&#xD;
fering man.&#xD;
It was easy to track him, for he seemed&#xD;
careless of all external objects. He walked,&#xD;
scarcely lifting his eyes to direct himself,&#xD;
and muttering, in a low, stifled voice, broken&#xD;
words and exclamations.&#xD;
"AhI and I consoled her, I encouraged&#xD;
her, when -. Good GodI how unhappy&#xD;
will she be in the lascivious gaieties of that&#xD;
country, and I - with the pain in my heart,&#xD;
with the burning sore in my breast ! I knew&#xD;
it. I thought myself prepared to endurepre.&#xD;
pared to suffer, and now -now Iam mad."&#xD;
He covered his features with the rim of&#xD;
his slouched hat, and walked quickly out of&#xD;
the city, in the environs of which they were&#xD;
now, towards Belem. The two spies follow&#xD;
ed him afar off. But Massor, generally so&#xD;
careful and cautibus, did not even cast a&#xD;
look at them. He had in reality no faculty&#xD;
or attention to expend upon the caution&#xD;
trouble, strife and demands of external life,&#xD;
because all were absorbed and participated&#xD;
in the terrible struggle that raged in th&#xD;
inmost recesses of his soul.&#xD;
"Aih," ho sighed as, weary of the agony&#xD;
he endeavored to blot the subject from hib&#xD;
thoughts, "we prepare ourself for death&#xD;
too, we know that we must die, as surely a&#xD;
&#xD;
S8 EcEET,&#xD;
we live, and-yet when the last hour comes,&#xD;
how fearfully do we combat with the dark&#xD;
angel; how powerfully do we struggle for&#xD;
life. I prepared myself for this, it has como&#xD;
and, Great God, what shall I do to stay my&#xD;
reason ? What can I da to chase madness&#xD;
from my brain ?.&#xD;
Sometimes running, sometimes walking,&#xD;
the gipsy reached Belem,. and, stopping at&#xD;
the inn of St Ignatius, called to the keeper:&#xD;
"My horse!"&#xD;
A splendid black steed was brought, and&#xD;
Massor, mounting, rode away. But the two&#xD;
spies were not to be shaken off. Unable to&#xD;
procure -hoises in time to follow the gipsy,&#xD;
they concluded to dog him on foot,. which&#xD;
was, after all, no hard task, as he rode very&#xD;
slowly, and was still buried in his own&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;
The gipsy rode to the camp of his tribe,&#xD;
which was again upon the same hill, where&#xD;
we at first met them, when Donna Gloria&#xD;
escaped from the convent. Massor had&#xD;
chosen, for his temporary residence, the&#xD;
small cave, upon the suminit, which Gloria&#xD;
occupied 'the night she passed with the&#xD;
gipsies. F-om this cave he could not only&#xD;
overlook the encampment, but it also com-&#xD;
manded an extended view of the surround.&#xD;
ing country  Massor gave some orders to&#xD;
the crowd of gipsies that welcomed his ar-&#xD;
rival, put his horse in charge of a young&#xD;
man, and then ascended to the small cave.&#xD;
When the spies, that followed him, had&#xD;
carefully noted all this, from the top of t o&#xD;
f trees, which they climbed the better to-&#xD;
f observe his motions after arriving at the&#xD;
gipsy camp, they returned to the next vil-&#xD;
lage. Although extremely fatigued, they&#xD;
tarried not, but, hiring two horses, spurred&#xD;
on toward Lisbon immediately. Doubtless&#xD;
the King   had promised good pay, for&#xD;
, welcome intelligence.&#xD;
,  Thus we leave Massor, tossing sleeplessly&#xD;
d upon his bed of straw, in the cave. The&#xD;
e spies sent by King .luan, to dog his steps,&#xD;
have been successful, and are galloping to&#xD;
, isbon, to inform his Majesty of the gipsy's&#xD;
s whereabouts. Has Massor the fatal doeu-&#xD;
, ments of the Prior with him in the cave ?&#xD;
s Does the King intend to have them stolen.&#xD;
&#xD;
Oa, PLOTS       AND&#xD;
or taken by violence? What is the cause of&#xD;
the gipsy's sorrow, what the occasion which&#xD;
stirred up those emotions of bitterness in&#xD;
his soul? Does the chieftain know of Glo-&#xD;
ria's death, and that all the hopes he founded&#xD;
on that beauteous lady were shattered upon&#xD;
the rock of her passions ?&#xD;
We shall see. And coming pages will&#xD;
solve the enigma cf his character, which,&#xD;
grand and mysterious, restlessly working for&#xD;
purposes asgrand and mysterious, is as yet&#xD;
ao enigma. Meanwhile we leave this part&#xD;
of the story,-the Prior an honored prisoner,&#xD;
the King again secure, the Queen bethrothed&#xD;

T H E A B D U C T I O N. -&#xD;
Tis near the close of day. Rosa Bananda&#xD;
sits eon an embroidered stool, pensively&#xD;
gazing at the sky. In her hand dangles a&#xD;
rose colored note, from which the silver&#xD;
thread is pending. Casting her eyes again&#xD;
upon it, she s3ans once more the page, and&#xD;
presses it to her lips. Her bosom heaves&#xD;
passionately, and her eyes soften with emo&#xD;
tion, as she reads, in that murmuring voice,&#xD;
so expressiveof surpr so and joy:&#xD;
"Dearest Rosa: I irve returned, and, be&#xD;
fore 1 can wait upon your mother, I must&#xD;
see you alone. They tell me that you are&#xD;
free. Be at the gate thataleads from  tlhe&#xD;
rear of tire garden, whea all have retired,&#xD;
and there meet,-&#xD;
Your                     ENRIQUE"&#xD;
The letter had been delivered to her a&#xD;
short time since by Maria Flunoz, who, after&#xD;
Gloria's death, had entered the service of'&#xD;
Rosa. A stranger had delivered it to her&#xD;
with the  request to give it to Rosa when&#xD;
alone.  All doubts of Rosa's were now&#xD;
solved, and the full confidence of love re&#xD;
turned, with the knowledge of Enrique't.&#xD;
return. She was elated the more, because,&#xD;
being free from liguel, the loving maiden&#xD;
believed in a speedy removal of all obstrue&#xD;
tions between Enrique and herself.&#xD;
Who knows not the delight, that, as it&#xD;
were, pervades and intoxicates the soul,&#xD;

when we hear of the loved one's return,&#xD;
when we are surprised to find the dearest&#xD;
one near us, instead of far distant? Rosa&#xD;
still thought of Enrique as far away, with-&#xD;
out probable chance of safe return, and, at&#xD;
once, while tortured by doubts of his love,&#xD;
a note is, put in her hand, which announces&#xD;
his safe return, love an1 happiness.&#xD;
She sat there dreaming, conjuring up the&#xD;
loved form as she hoped to behold it, irqa.&#xD;
gining to hear the sounds and words that&#xD;
would meet her ear, and forming replies&#xD;
to the endearing epithets, which she&#xD;
fancied to hear. It was dark in the apart-&#xD;
ment, and Rosa still sat, alone? no!I not&#xD;
alone. The chamber was not dark, not&#xD;
empty to her dreamy gaze. Her eyes were&#xD;
not turned to the shadows that dwelled&#xD;
around, but gazed internally upn the-&#xD;
golden fabrications of her youthful imagi.&#xD;
nation,&#xD;
The voice of the organ rolled through.&#xD;
the fretted aisle of the high cathedral, and&#xD;
floated in clouds of melody around the&#xD;
shining altar, whose high tapers sh-me&#xD;
through the pure white wreaths of incense,&#xD;
like golden stars. The carved angels and&#xD;
gilded ornaments, the glowing pictures and&#xD;
flowery, lace-trimmeil altars, all smiled as&#xD;
if in joy. And before the great altar with&#xD;
the blazing tapers stood  Rosa, in bri tal&#xD;
costume at the side of Enrique, and the&#xD;
Cardinal in scarlet robes approached, and&#xD;
blessed their union, and married them.&#xD;
Ar.d at the side of a pillar stood Miguel,&#xD;
his face convulsed with rage, and his eyes&#xD;
rolling with mad fire. As Enrique took&#xD;
Rosa's hand, Miguel sprang between, and&#xD;
with a hissing cry&#xD;
Rosa opened her eyes, and found her&#xD;
mother standing before her, with Maria&#xD;
Flunoz. She had slept and dreamt.&#xD;
"Will you not retire to bed ?" inquired&#xD;
Donned, Bananda uneasily.&#xD;
it was some moments before Rosa could&#xD;
collect her thoughts, and ask:&#xD;
"Is it late, mother? I seem, to have&#xD;
slept for some time."&#xD;
"I do not know how long you have sept.&#xD;
But since you remained in your apartments&#xD;
this evening, I came to bid you good night,&#xD;

"It was a happy dreamI"               "Unclose the door, foolish girl," cried&#xD;

"Not very, my dear mother. I will retire The key was there, and Maria, turning it,&#xD;

to the floor.                          disappointed.&#xD;
" No, no, I can not go to bed," she said to "I hear approaching steps," whispered&#xD;
'the waiting maid. "Enrique awaits me; Maria, bending her head, "let us go back."&#xD;

"To the garden ?" inquired Maria. "Will of the garden, with slow steps. The females&#xD;

"I must, girl. I must go down; but I ing down in the shadow of the walls, fol-&#xD;

"But why go at all ?"  -             and Rosa lay on his bosoap. In the same&#xD;

Without further words, Rosa drew an secured. She had scarcely realized the in-&#xD;

Meanwhile the table was set, and the&#xD;
victuals brought in.&#xD;
"Hie has taken two spoons full the rascal,"&#xD;
cried the captain when he saw the fry.&#xD;
Miguel now knocked softly at the door of&#xD;
the chamber.&#xD;
Maria opened it, and showed her face&#xD;
pursed up, and eyes bright with a vixenish&#xD;
glance.&#xD;
"The meal is ready. We ask Donna Ro.&#xD;
sa to preside at the table," he said.&#xD;
Maria exchanged a few words with Rosa,&#xD;
and then said:&#xD;
"My mistress wishes rest and quiet.-&#xD;
Proceed without her. She will not see you."&#xD;
The door was again closed.&#xD;
The captain sent for his brother, who bore&#xD;
the unctioustame of father Modestus, and&#xD;
the three dined without Rosa. Miguel eat-&#xD;
ing and drinking, and not knowing what he&#xD;
swallowed or why, but-his whole mind bent&#xD;
on finding means to gain Rosa's affections.&#xD;

good a dinner to be served, when, after all,&#xD;
thpe ldy di i not-appear. And father Mo.&#xD;
destus stuffing himself with whatever he&#xD;
could lay hands on. After dinner, Miguel&#xD;
and Misardo walked upon the quarter deck,&#xD;
while the priest remained yet at the table.&#xD;
"Well captain," said Miguel, endeavoring&#xD;
to assume a humorous tone, which lay far&#xD;
from his true feelings at that moment, "the&#xD;
ship is going at a rapid rate."&#xD;
"Yes, yes," replied Misardo, "a rapid&#xD;
rate. How much have you left of your pa.&#xD;
trimony, Don Miguel?" heinquired, suddenly.&#xD;
"How much ? What insolence is this?"&#xD;
"You may call it insolence, senor, but it&#xD;
is only a proper regard to business."&#xD;
"A proper regard to business that con&#xD;
cerns you not. Believe me, Misardo, it is&#xD;
best.for you to keep your mind on your own&#xD;
ship, and your own concerns, for if you ven-&#xD;
ture from these upon ground that is not&#xD;
yours-"&#xD;
"Well, if Iventure from these,what then?"&#xD;
"Then you will be crushed under foot like&#xD;
the snail that has left its house."&#xD;
Misardo tried to look offended, but suc-&#xD;
eseded not. This bold reply had put down&#xD;
his spirit. Miguel exercised that control&#xD;
&#xD;
AL SECANT,&#xD;
over the captain, which physical strength&#xD;
and courage is apt to usurp, and which Is&#xD;
possessed in a far hither degree, by mental&#xD;
and moral elevation.&#xD;
" Be not chafed at my words, but in ar.&#xD;
ranging everything as you wished it, I have&#xD;
incurred expeuises which if not reimbursed&#xD;
would ruin me," said the captain.&#xD;
" What is the aim of all your twaddle ?&#xD;
Have I not acted generous enough in prom.&#xD;
ising five hundred goldpieces and the repay.&#xD;
ment of expenses ?"&#xD;
"Oh surely, you have promised wellI&#xD;
"What then is the meaning of your&#xD;
words ?"&#xD;
"To promise is one thing; to fulfil, anoth-&#xD;
er."&#xD;
"Dog of a captain! Do you doubt my&#xD;
word ?"&#xD;
" I doubt not your word, but your ability&#xD;
to fulfil it." 1&#xD;
"My ability to pay?"&#xD;
"Yes. Be not offended."&#xD;
"What? Know you not the wealth of&#xD;
Donna Bananda, and of her daughter?"&#xD;
" That belongs to them; aid they will&#xD;
never pay me for forcibly aiding to abduct&#xD;
the young lady."&#xD;
"But I will. Do you not see, blockhead?"&#xD;
"Ah I ah!" sighed Misardo. "Your mar-&#xD;
riage with the young lady is an idle scheme.&#xD;
She would rather kill herself than marry&#xD;
you. I perceived that at once."&#xD;
"Did you? Know then, stupid beastthat&#xD;
ere we arrive at Sicily she will be my wife.&#xD;
What knowest thou of woman ? "&#xD;
" May Heaven aid you to conquer her!&#xD;
This is the last straw I can catch at. Oh my&#xD;
dear, my hard earned moneyI Will it ever&#xD;
-return to its owner's purse?"&#xD;
"Do not fear, captain."&#xD;
"But you do not pursue the suit with ar-&#xD;
dor. You look at the lady, as if she were&#xD;
snow, that may not be touched. Oh, if I&#xD;
had such a chance to gain a fortune, it would&#xD;
pour fire through my veins, and I would go&#xD;
about courting in a more ardent manner.-&#xD;
Wealth to be gained by merely coaxing a&#xD;
young chit to marry!   It -is a splendid&#xD;
chance. If you fail, you deserve to be a&#xD;
beggar all your life."&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, PLOTS AND COUNTInPLOTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
"But I shall not fail!  I treat her too&#xD;
soft, too gentle; she has a strong will, but it&#xD;
can not resist mine !"&#xD;
"iYou are raving! She does resist you I"&#xD;
"iNo longerI You will see that since the&#xD;
gentleness of a gentleman will not succeed&#xD;
with her, I will appear in all the roughness&#xD;
of a soldier. She must marry me, t'.at is&#xD;

Here the priest, who had, meanwhile, still&#xD;
continued to eat in the cabin, rejoined them,&#xD;
wiping the fat from his mouth, with his&#xD;
dirty sleeve.I&#xD;
"Brother," he said, "I have observed&#xD;
three important facts, on board of your ves.&#xD;
eel."&#xD;
"What are they, Modestus?"&#xD;
"In the first place, the lady you have on&#xD;
board is beautiful!"&#xD;
"1We know that," replied Misardo.&#xD;
"Is she in the cabin?"  inquired Miguel.&#xD;
"Perhaps not now, since I have left," said&#xD;
the priest.&#xD;
"What do you mean by 'since I have&#xD;
left?' Came she there only to seek you," said&#xD;
Miguel.&#xD;
"I imagineso," replied the priest, "since&#xD;
the fair one said it herself."&#xD;
"1What could she want with you ? Speak,&#xD;
gross abomination of priesthood!"'&#xD;
"Address me with proper respect, senor.&#xD;
For though I am here to serve you, it is in&#xD;
my proper dignity and office. lit officio Dei'&#xD;
The lady bespoke my protection against&#xD;
your wild attacks, senor, which I granted."&#xD;
"Alh, indeedI " replied Miguel scornfully,&#xD;
"and how will you protect her?"&#xD;
"By stepping -"&#xD;
"Fool," cried Misardo, "all the chance&#xD;
we have of being paid by this gentleman,&#xD;
rests on the accomplishment of his wishes,&#xD;
and the success of his suit with this lady.&#xD;
What induces you to meddle with other&#xD;
men's concerns?  Keep your dirty fingers&#xD;
in your own empty pockets."&#xD;
" That alters the case, fratre io I Still&#xD;
the lady is very pleasant to look at. Con-&#xD;
cerning your advice to keep my dirty fin-&#xD;
gem in my own empty pockets, know, infidel,&#xD;
that these fingers, though dirty in the flesh,&#xD;
are spiritually pure, and full of salvation.-&#xD;
&#xD;
If my pockets, perchance, should be emp-&#xD;
ty--"&#xD;
" Thy belly is nevertheless full," broke in&#xD;
Misardo.&#xD;
"A very just observation. Now to the&#xD;
second fact that has attracted my observa-&#xD;
tion. Your cook puts not enough garlic to&#xD;
the meat."&#xD;
" Pshaw," replied Misardo, "his cookery&#xD;
is expensive enough, since he uses two&#xD;
spoonsful of fat to a fry."&#xD;
" Holy RosandaI If he can make a fry&#xD;
with two spoonsful he is a real artist. But,&#xD;
regarding the garlic, he is too saving; my&#xD;
stomach, even now, complains of the unsa-&#xD;
vory meat. . Promise me, my brother, for&#xD;
the sake of my -precious health, that you will&#xD;
speak to the cook, on this point."&#xD;
"Very well. Quiet your perturbed spirit,&#xD;
holy father, and let us know the third obser-&#xD;
vation you have made."&#xD;
"My third observation is concerning my&#xD;
grandmother's bedstead. She had to sell it,&#xD;
poor, dear woman, for she needed money.-&#xD;
Having agreed to sell it to one dealer, for a&#xD;
certain price, she happened to meet another,&#xD;
to whom she related her first bargain.&#xD;
I will give yon so much more, said he&#xD;
and will pay you in good money; for the&#xD;
other man is a counterfeiter.&#xD;
My grandmother then immediately took&#xD;
his money and soid, therefore, the bedstead&#xD;
to him."&#xD;
" In what manner, oh dirtiest and most&#xD;
stupid of priests, does this bng rigmarole&#xD;
apply to anything on this vessel?" inquired&#xD;
Miguel.&#xD;
"In this respect, worthiest of gentlemen,"&#xD;
replied Modestus. "My brother of a captain&#xD;
and myself have made a bargain with you,&#xD;
concerning the carrying off.this lady. But&#xD;
now the second dealer, or this lady offers to&#xD;
pay double the sum you promised for bearing&#xD;
back and liberating her. If we keep the&#xD;
agreement with you, sir," addressing Migu-&#xD;
el, "we assist in a piece or rascality. If we&#xD;
bear back this lady, it is an act of the high-&#xD;
est virtue."&#xD;
" Al, traitor," cried Miguel, striking the&#xD;
priest on the cheek.&#xD;
" Al, fool!I"  cried Misardo turning his,&#xD;
back upon him.&#xD;

"Senor, this language is unbecoming -&#xD;
Let.me either pass to my chamber, or leave&#xD;
the cabin. For you grow more and mor,&#xD;
hateful to me, as your conduct developes it&#xD;
self."&#xD;
" Very well, I see how it is. In an hono&#xD;
rable way you will not consent to be my&#xD;
wife. I have you in my power, and I tell&#xD;
you Rosa, that dishonored, you shall yet&#xD;
kneel before me, and ask for the hand you&#xD;
now so proudly reject!"&#xD;
Rosa grew pale, very pale; still, with the&#xD;
dignity of innocence and grief she said:&#xD;
"Senor I you are mad. Pray, relieve us&#xD;
of your frenzied ravings."'&#xD;
"Frenzied ravings. you call them?  If I&#xD;
act madly you are the cause of it, and you&#xD;
shall be the cure. Enough of mutual re-&#xD;
proaches. Come, my love, and kiss me."&#xD;
Miguel scarcely had pronounced these&#xD;
words, when he was at Rosa's side, and had&#xD;
his arms twined around her. With all her&#xD;
feeble strength the maiden wrestled, but to&#xD;
nopurpose. Miguel's face was close to her's,&#xD;
and his burning lips touched her cheek.&#xD;
Rosa, unable to disengage herself, angry,&#xD;
terrified and disgusted, criea loudly for help.&#xD;
Aid however was at hand; Maria had con-&#xD;
sidered how best to serve her mistress; see-&#xD;
ing Rosa struggling in Miguel's arms, she&#xD;
approached anddrawinr his own sword from&#xD;
the seablrd at his side, pushed him back&#xD;
with one hand, while, in the other, she bran.&#xD;
dished the glittering weapon.&#xD;
. " Back, coward," she cried, "or I will kill&#xD;
you with your own sword."&#xD;
- "Kill, me, and I shall'at least die in her&#xD;
arms!" cried Miguel in passionate frenzy,&#xD;
drawing Rosa closely to his bosom.&#xD;
Maria was undecided for a moment, and&#xD;
then resolutely thrust the sharp point of the&#xD;
sword into Miguel's shoulder.  A sharp&#xD;
pang shot across his chest. It was only a.&#xD;
flesh wounJl; it is true, yet the blood spurted&#xD;
out, and the nerves throbbed with the shock,&#xD;
which always attends, more or less, any in-&#xD;
jury. It is generally a great difference to&#xD;
say "' Kill, me," and to feel the cold steel en-&#xD;
1 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
t teriig the body, It was so in this cane.-&#xD;
e Miguel instantly released Rosa, and started&#xD;
back.&#xD;
"Hellish woman, you have wounded mel"&#xD;
e he cried, and threw himself on Maria. Bt&#xD;
e she eluded him, and always presented the&#xD;
point of the sword, wherever he tried 4t ap-&#xD;
proach her. Rosa flew to the door of the&#xD;
- cabin to call for aid. Miguel had barred  .&#xD;
Even while she was undoing the bars, Migu-&#xD;
I el, had almost caught Maria and disarme4&#xD;
t her. But the nimble chamberraid again&#xD;
slipped him  and escaped into the Onmall&#xD;
chamber beyond the cabin. Immedsiaoiy&#xD;
Miguel had closed the door upon her, and&#xD;
thrown a heavy iron candlestick. upon tho&#xD;
massy hooks that projected from, the doay&#xD;
and wall, to hold the bar which lcked it.-&#xD;
But the bar was missing in this instance,&#xD;
and, therefore, Miguel used a candlestick in&#xD;
its place. Vain were the attempts of Maria&#xD;
to burst the door and re-enter the cabin.1--&#xD;
She was securely confined in the bed champ.&#xD;
ber.&#xD;
Rosa had succeeded in opening the other&#xD;
door, but, ere she could slip out, a strong&#xD;
hand seized her robe and drew her baok.-&#xD;
It was Miguel, who re-closed the door, and&#xD;
barred it.&#xD;
"You are mine now, wholly mine!'".he&#xD;
cried, drawing hei to his breastwhilehis&#xD;
face flushed dark red and his eyesemitted a&#xD;
wild phosphorescent lighk&#xD;
"I am not, I never will be," was the deter-&#xD;
mined reply of Rosa, as she tore away froin&#xD;
him, and endeavored to, defend herself with&#xD;
a chair, Miguel easily caught the chair and&#xD;
disarmed her. But, again she slipped along&#xD;
the wall to the door which Miguel had but&#xD;
imperfectly closed and, tossing the bar at&#xD;
Miguel opened it and ran out. He followed.&#xD;

The sailors rose, and reluctantly dragged&#xD;

in tones of death-like terror:    . I&#xD;

announcement- Deatg was everywhere ! in&#xD;
the storm and the waves, in the lightning's&#xD;

That cry was heard by Rosa and Maria,&#xD;
rung in the ears of Miguel and Misardo, and&#xD;
shot line a bolt of terror into the hearts of I&#xD;
all on board of the St Pedro di Alvendi.-&#xD;
The violence of the storm had decreased,&#xD;
somewhat, and the winds had paused, as it4&#xD;
were, to look upon the wrestling of the ship I&#xD;
, with its fate. Alas the struggle would soon&#xD;
be over, since, creeping waters already gush-&#xD;

Him who rules the winds and waves.&#xD;
" Help us, help us, Great GodI" cried the&#xD;
priest, his demeanor, actions and language&#xD;

gradually rising, sounded like a trumpet, up e&#xD;

Misardo had been absent,,but now he&#xD;
came from the cabin, loaded with small bags&#xD;
of gold, which, stuffed into the lining of his '&#xD;
clothes, swelled him up very much.. Indeed,&#xD;
he was so loaded that.he ceuld but m~ive&#xD;
with the greatest difficulty. : For, loath to&#xD;
leave any of his treasure, he had endeavor-&#xD;
ed to stow away a fortune in the lining of&#xD;
his dress. Some very valuable jewels were&#xD;
fastened to the inside of his shirt uponthe&#xD;
bosom. Taking little heed of those engaged&#xD;
in prayers, who were still upon their knees,&#xD;
he shouted: "Make ready the boats! "&#xD;
A wave washed the ship at the same mo-&#xD;
ment, and, sweeping along those sailors, that&#xD;
had not secured themselves by, grasping&#xD;
ropes, spars, or like supporters, dast them&#xD;
against the bulkheads. Some were bruised,&#xD;
while others remained uninjured. Among&#xD;
the latter was Rosa, among the former. Mi.&#xD;

In spite, however, of the storm and the&#xD;
continual rise and fall of the billows, the&#xD;
boats were ready in a little time. Not too&#xD;
soon; for already the ship fell.heavy and&#xD;
solidly upon the waters, and sank almost be-&#xD;
neath them at each motion. Misardo, well&#xD;
acquainted with the strength of the repec-&#xD;
ive boats, sprang into the smallest one, fol--&#xD;
owed by his brother.&#xD;
"Shove off, Modestus," cried the captain,&#xD;
'or too many will enter."&#xD;
"No, brother; there is Don Miguel bring-&#xD;
ng the lady, she shall go with us." The&#xD;
priest had, through all these trying evens,&#xD;
ssumed and retained an irresistible air of&#xD;
uthority. Miguel, with Rosa and Maria,&#xD;
and the boatswain Joseppo entered the boat,&#xD;
which then,nearly 'full, was shoved from the&#xD;

Show them to me," cried Misardo. "Will&#xD;
&#xD;
you ? Show them, or I will murder you.&#xD;
Show me where they dre, for I am very poor.&#xD;
I want gold," and he arose and threw his&#xD;
arms in the air, with wild, bloodshot eyes&#xD;
resting on Miguel.&#xD;
"t Wouldyou take gold from the churchI&#xD;
Would you melt down crosses and images!"&#xD;
cried father Modestus, whom this delirium&#xD;
also seized in turn. "Ah, sicrileger, will&#xD;
not the Inquisition seize you ? Will they&#xD;
not make you disgorge all your gold ? Yes,&#xD;
disgorge ! because you had not enough gar-&#xD;
lie to season it. Garlic and gold go togeth-&#xD;
er ! Ah, St. Peter di Alvendi, give me the&#xD;
stomach of a Jew!" finished the priest, fold-&#xD;
ing his arms.&#xD;
"'The purse of a JewI " cried Misardo.&#xD;
"The stomach ! Garlic I want, not gold!&#xD;
Garlic !"&#xD;
Joseppo rose and, straining his eyes to&#xD;
the utmost, looked steadily in an eastern di-&#xD;
rection for some moments, and then cried,&#xD;
with a voice of inexpressible joy:&#xD;
"A SHIP! A SH IP!"&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
GOD I    NEAR THE HELPLESS.&#xD;
A ship is driving through the foaming waves&#xD;
on her way to the straits of Gibraltar, and&#xD;
to Portugal. She is a large, bulky vessel,&#xD;
and rolls about from side to side like a fat&#xD;
burgomaster. Her breadth of beam, heavi-&#xD;
ness of spars, and indeed her entire lcok&#xD;
denote that she was built in Holland. There&#xD;
is such an exquisite air of heaviness and&#xD;
substance, of strong fat sense and guilders&#xD;
about Dutch built vessels and men, that the&#xD;
merest dolt could not inistake either of them.&#xD;
We have said that the vessel in question&#xD;
was Dutch; and this is saying much in her&#xD;
praise, for at that time Holland was one of&#xD;
the very first maritime nations.&#xD;
Let us take the reader on board. Well&#xD;
protected by an awning, that overshadowed&#xD;
the greater part of the cleanly quarter deek,&#xD;
and resting on small carpets, spread upon&#xD;
the deck, we meet four gentlemen. In one&#xD;
of them we recognise Sporaso, the captain&#xD;
of the vessel, in the other two Hernando and&#xD;
Enrique, and the small fat man, with the&#xD;
good natured green goggle eyes who always&#xD;

128                      'H EFA TA&#xD;
polishes his nails with such industry, is a&#xD;
Jewish physician, a cousin of the captain.-&#xD;
The name of the lattetr is Moses ben Moses.&#xD;
"Perm'it me to observe," said the captain,&#xD;
"that in Holland, the merchant, and the&#xD;
artizan are becoming of greater importance&#xD;
every day. There is also a splendid, a vali-&#xD;
ant and wealthy nobility, yet each day weak&#xD;
ens its power And importance. It will at&#xD;
last disappear from the face of the land."&#xD;
"I cannot conceive such a state of things,"&#xD;
cried Hernando, "A state without nobility&#xD;
can not but fall. Who will defend it against&#xD;
the enemy without, and check the power of&#xD;
the monarch within ? Who will protectthe&#xD;
nation, enforce the execution of its laws and&#xD;
protect the fine arts?  Would Rome have&#xD;
become Rome without Patricians, to lead in&#xD;
battle, protect in' peace and patronise the&#xD;
arts.? Would Greece have become the land&#xD;
of refinement, of poetry and beauty, wit'ont&#xD;
noble patronage to foster the flowery enlight&#xD;
enment of the age ? Take away tne nobility&#xD;
and you have a barbarian people left."&#xD;
"You are warm in your arguments, senor,"&#xD;
gravely replied the captain. "That the no-&#xD;
bility was great, and perhaps good in some&#xD;
states of society I will allow. Yet in the&#xD;
present advanced age who will acknowledge&#xD;
the claims founded merely on blood,or descent&#xD;
foiom a great and virtuous ancestor ? In our&#xD;
Holland, we show the solid strength of a na&#xD;
tion, in which the nobility is a nonentity, in&#xD;
which King and nation are the only estates&#xD;
acknowledged. And do not our burghers&#xD;
produce greater men in every department,&#xD;
then can be made of the weak saplings of an&#xD;
old family?  Were not the great men of&#xD;
science and action, the great navigators anl&#xD;
astronomers, the great heroes of ancient and&#xD;
modern times, all of the people? "&#xD;
"Hold, there, senor capitano, "said Her,&#xD;
nando, "the great men of ancient and mod-&#xD;
ern times, say you ? Let us see. Was not&#xD;
the Roman Brutus a patrician?  And the&#xD;
Roman heroes and poets all w ere of noble&#xD;
houses. -Do we not see in ancient history,&#xD;
whether, of Greece, Rcme, Carthage, Syria&#xD;
orPersia, that when ever the rights of peo-&#xD;
ple were assailed, the people defendedthem&#xD;
ol when stirred up to it by noblest.defen&#xD;
de'them under the lead of the nobility."&#xD;
&#xD;
At. SECRET,&#xD;
"The nobility always defended - its own&#xD;
rights and privileges under the pretense of&#xD;
defending the people's rights. On the con'.&#xD;
trary, whatever oppresses the nation must&#xD;
increase their power, and in whatever&#xD;
country the nobility is rich and great, the&#xD;
people will be found weak and poor. But&#xD;
when the nobles are powerless, then com-&#xD;
merce,-trade, and agriculture bloom, and&#xD;
yield their rewards to the man of the&#xD;
people who works to gain them," said the&#xD;
captain.&#xD;
"See how crooked the notions of this&#xD;
good captain are," said Hernando. "He is&#xD;
a traveler, has been in England where I&#xD;
have never been, knows, therefore, better&#xD;
than any the prosperity of that nation, with&#xD;
its hereditary, wealthy nobles, and yet as-&#xD;
serts all he has said. Is this not ridiculous?&#xD;
He knows further history, and is well ac;&#xD;
qiainted with the fact, that the liberties of&#xD;
England, greater than those of any other&#xD;
land, the seeds of the greatest and purest&#xD;
freedom that can ever exist, were wrested&#xD;
in the fagna Charta from a tyrannical&#xD;
king, by whom? By Nobles, by Barons and&#xD;
Earls. Further, look upon the knights of&#xD;
the romantic ages the knight errants, and&#xD;
crusaders, and then can you maintain, that&#xD;
they were not the cultivators of poetry hnd&#xD;
the patrons of art, the redressors of wrongs&#xD;
and guardians of justice, the benefactor of&#xD;
an ungrateful people? They were the men&#xD;
who freely dedicated their lives and posses-&#xD;
sions to a high and great idea, the men of&#xD;
holy enthusiasm, graad soul and, grand de.&#xD;
velopment of physical power."&#xD;
" But let us discuss the principle of the&#xD;
thing,' said the captain, who unexpectedly&#xD;
found himself getting worsted in this argu-&#xD;
ment. "Let us see whether-it is right' and&#xD;
just that, because a father has been wise or&#xD;
brave, and, therefore, deserved nobility and&#xD;
honors, his descendants' should enjoy the&#xD;
same for all times, however depraved and&#xD;
useless they are."&#xD;
" I think it to be right, and just senor,"&#xD;
replied Hernando. "Look you; do not you,&#xD;
and does not every law on earth concede that&#xD;
it isjust, the possessions of the father should&#xD;
descend to his children ?  What greater&#xD;
&#xD;
On, PLOTS       AND&#xD;
possession can a father transmit to his&#xD;
children than a clear unspotted name ? If&#xD;
he has gained honors and titles which are&#xD;
thqrewards of worth, 'are they not the&#xD;
better part of his children's heritage ?- If&#xD;
the state, for due services has conceded a&#xD;
privilege to the father, is it not just that his&#xD;
children should inherit it, as that they&#xD;
should inherit the money which a private&#xD;
citizen might have paid him, for certain&#xD;
services ? You may as well maintain that&#xD;
the child has no right to the father's naine,&#xD;
as that hereditary nobility is unjust. Even&#xD;
our divine law, the scripture inspired by&#xD;
God, sanctions this principle. And ' the&#xD;
merits of the father shall be remembered&#xD;
to the last generation,' is repeatedly men-&#xD;
tioned. What is hereditary nobility but a&#xD;
commemoration of the ancestor's merits&#xD;
and virtues in his descendants ?  Then, in&#xD;
our history, the history of Israel, do we&#xD;
not find that God established the house of&#xD;
Dgvid to be a perpetual royal race ? And&#xD;
everything that is said in defense of heredi.&#xD;
tary monarchy, defends at the same time&#xD;
hereditary nobility."&#xD;
"But did nature create men, to ba differ-&#xD;
ently privileged and endowed with different&#xD;
rights,or to enjoy an equal justice andright?"&#xD;
asked the captain, scornfully.&#xD;
"What a question," cried Hernando,&#xD;
"Did not Nature herself endow man with&#xD;
widely different capacities ? Nature can not&#xD;
but create the perfect and the imperfect.-,&#xD;
For the substance to create both is within&#xD;
her, and therefore it is a necessity that both&#xD;
should exist. Therefore men, more or less&#xD;
perfect in mind, soul, or body, men that differ&#xD;
as greatly in their physical, mental and mo-&#xD;
ral capacities, as the mountain differs from&#xD;
the valley, and the sheaf from the thistle, live&#xD;
and move. in this world. Has not nature&#xD;
then , invested with greater privilege one&#xD;
man in the physical, mental or moral advan-&#xD;
tage he has over an other ? Seems there not&#xD;
to be a nobility among animals, plants, and&#xD;
even stones?  Ah, do not say nature made&#xD;
mnan equal, for equality is a principle that&#xD;
can not exist in a well ordered state of&#xD;
things. All can not be heads, all can not&#xD;
17&#xD;
&#xD;
Co UN'TER PLo'I0s.                129&#xD;
.be feet. Each has an appointed sphere, and&#xD;
equality is an empty ideal."&#xD;
" Then you do not even concede that equal&#xD;
justice should be meted out?" inquired the&#xD;
astonishedcaptain. .&#xD;
" Equal justice? What call you equal&#xD;
justice. Fitting one and the same straight&#xD;
garment upon men of different sizes and&#xD;
proportions? Should justicebe justicephere&#xD;
must be different laws governing each indi-&#xD;
vidual case. Justice is not just, unless she&#xD;
considers the minutest shades of feeling&#xD;
which actuate man. , Human justice can not&#xD;
do that. But divine justice will. And ma-&#xD;
ny arogue that has been hung here accord-&#xD;
ing to the most just laws, will be received&#xD;
into Paradise by God. For God's justice&#xD;
must be just, just to men in their weakness,&#xD;
and in their different mental, moral and&#xD;
physical capacities. Thus justice to be just,&#xD;
can not be equal."&#xD;
The conversation ceased there. For some&#xD;
moments, silence reigned on the quarter&#xD;
deck, until a sailor disturbed the company&#xD;
by the announcement, that a boat was in&#xD;
sight, and the people in her were making&#xD;
signs.&#xD;
Their lazy languor was thrown off in amo-&#xD;
ment, and all hastened to the forecastle to&#xD;
make out the boat. Those who have crossed&#xD;
the sea, know the languid stupor which to&#xD;
the casual passenger represents life on ship&#xD;
board. They know how incidents of the ve-&#xD;
ry slightest importance and interest, are ac-&#xD;
cepted and grasped at,as subjects for though&#xD;
during the long, weary hours. And so here.&#xD;
Each one strained his eyes to see the small&#xD;
dark speck upon the water, which seemed&#xD;
gradually approaching them.&#xD;
" Beyond doubt, it is a boat," said, the&#xD;
captain after a long look.&#xD;
" Can you not make out what is in.her?"&#xD;
inquired Hernando.&#xD;
"Not yet. See, they are throwing out&#xD;
something white. Can you not see it wave?"&#xD;
" Yes, I see something white in, motion."&#xD;
"What can it mean ? A singleboat thus&#xD;
alone on the sea! Captain, what are your&#xD;
conjectures about her?"  inquired Enrique.&#xD;
"I suppose the boat contains the survi&#xD;

"Was the man handsome?" inquired En-&#xD;
rique.&#xD;
"No, surely not, and therefore I could&#xD;
not have suspected what was in it."&#xD;
"What was in it? Well,will you speak?"&#xD;
"It purported to be from Don Enrique da&#xD;
Costa, and contained an entreaty to meet&#xD;
him secretly, at the garden door. I gave the&#xD;
note to my mistress who seemed to rejoice&#xD;
greatly thereat. We waited till all in the&#xD;
house were asleep, and then at the request&#xD;
of my mistress I followed her into the gar-&#xD;
den." Maria hadto stop. She was yet too&#xD;
weak. Enrique walked the quarter deck,&#xD;
bursting with impatience. Yet he could&#xD;
not urge Maria beyond her powers. After&#xD;
a short rest the chambermaid resumed :&#xD;
"We had scarcely opened the garden,&#xD;
door, when a man in a large cloak and hat&#xD;
approached. My lady cried: Enrique! and&#xD;
threw herself into his arms: Meanwhile&#xD;
three or four fellows, villains, and this Jo-&#xD;
seppo there the boldest-"&#xD;
. " Dont, dont, my pretty mistress," said&#xD;
Joseppo, who lay right opposite.&#xD;
"And pray, why don't? Was it not a vil-&#xD;
lany as black as your whiskers, you wicked&#xD;
fellow? "&#xD;
"1Go on, for heaven's sake," entreated En-&#xD;
rique, "I am dying of impatience. You&#xD;
were saying -"                      ,&#xD;
"II was saying, that these fellows fell on&#xD;
me, like mad dogs, and dragged me along to&#xD;
a boat. Meanwhile, my lady, had discovered&#xD;
that the man whom she embraced was not&#xD;
Don Enrique, but her cousin Don Miguel.-&#xD;
And as she raised a great cry at the decep-&#xD;
tion, he fairly took her up and carried her&#xD;
to the same boat, where they put me.&#xD;
"They then rowed to a ship, calledSt Pedro&#xD;
di Alvendi, and I understood, that the mean-&#xD;
ing of this black villany, our abduction-was&#xD;
that Don Miguel intended to force my lady&#xD;
to marry him. They had a fat monster on&#xD;
board of the ship too, a priest, who was to&#xD;
perform the ceremony; he is a pious 'man,&#xD;
that I doubt not, but a priest of the-church&#xD;
should not lend his hand to such villanies.&#xD;
&#xD;
C 0 U N T E R P L 0OT..S.           131&#xD;
There was also a stingy serpent of a captain.&#xD;
"The ship immediately started in spite of&#xD;
my lady's entreaties to let her return. Oh,&#xD;
I can not tell you then, of the terrible perse-&#xD;
cutions of Don Miguel di Sousa. He tried&#xD;
everything possible to cajole or force Douna&#xD;
Rosa into an union with him; but all in&#xD;
vain. At last he attacked her person."&#xD;
"Dastard, Villain and Forger I God help&#xD;
him if we meet."&#xD;
" But with his own sword I drove him&#xD;
back. Again he threw something over mhe&#xD;
and locked me in a small cabin room. Then&#xD;
came on the storm- Oh, thatnight of terror&#xD;
I shall never forget. Heaven have mercy&#xD;
on us ! -I thought the last day had come.-&#xD;
We were wrecked, and driven about on the&#xD;
sea for near three days, ere we met you."&#xD;
"But where is that monster, who carried&#xD;
off my sweet lady?" inquired Enrique. ,&#xD;
"Yonder cabincontains him. Heescaped&#xD;
in the same boat, and was saved with us."&#xD;
Enrique briefly thanked Maria Flunos,&#xD;
and then with hasty strides went to the cab-&#xD;
in door and endeavored to enter. But here&#xD;
he was met by Moses ben Moses.&#xD;
"You can not see my patients now, and&#xD;
especially the lady. She has much need of&#xD;
rest, and her frame can not bear the least&#xD;
excitement."&#xD;
" Not her, but that large man with the&#xD;
black hair and eyes," and he endeavored to&#xD;
pass.&#xD;
"I can not allow you-positively not," re-&#xD;
peated the physician. " You cant postpone&#xD;
your business with him, until he is well."&#xD;
"How soon will he be recovered?"&#xD;
"In a few days. Refrain from   seeing&#xD;
any of these weak people until then; pray&#xD;
do," and the physician locked the cabin door.&#xD;
We turn to Hernando. What was it that&#xD;
rose and burned in his bosom, and like the&#xD;
volcano's eruption, threW floods of fire&#xD;
through his veins and arteries?  What har-&#xD;
mony, strong and deep vibrated through the&#xD;
inmost.recesses of his being. Was it again&#xD;
love ? It was. And love of Rosa? Assured-&#xD;
ly. It had existed, although he imagined it&#xD;
dead. It appeared, not as a ghost of former&#xD;
affection, but as a living fire, bright and hot.&#xD;
Ilernando loved Rosa, loved still, with the&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7223-00000067"/>&#xD;
132                       TU, F- FA T,&#xD;
same ardor, the same hopes, the same desir&#xD;
that had crazed his brain when he threi&#xD;
Enrique from the tower.&#xD;
But experience had come-since then. H&#xD;
would not now endeavor to make away wit]&#xD;
his'brother. He would not again harm En&#xD;
rique, for he had once felt the thousan,&#xD;
sharp knives of guilt enter his soul, had onc&#xD;
swallowed the fire-filled cup of crime, an&#xD;
the horrible recollection still stood a warn-&#xD;
ing shadow in his bosom. But, and alas&#xD;
thus is man, he felt, indefinitely, vaguely&#xD;
but still strongly, that could he enjoy Rosa'i&#xD;
love, upon the ruins of Enrique's life, could&#xD;
he wed Rosa upon the grave of his brother&#xD;
he might, he even now might-&#xD;
"Down with you worm, serpent from Par&#xD;
adise I1" cried the young man, stamping up&#xD;
on the deck. "Down, and poison not my&#xD;
soul by thy insinuations. I will never touch&#xD;
his life ! Never decide by rude combat the&#xD;
rivalry of our souls. Yet it is impossible he&#xD;
can love her. He enjoys her embrace, her&#xD;
kiss, the glorious consciousness of her love-&#xD;
calmly, joyfully, but oh so calmly. While&#xD;
I would feel heaven in her kiss, divine fire&#xD;
in her embrace, and for one moment's con-&#xD;
seiousnessof her love, would be content to&#xD;
die the next. Oh, like a flame, my arms&#xD;
should embrace her, my lips should inhale&#xD;
her breath, my bosom should heave against&#xD;
her own, like a sea of fire. Oh God I- alife&#xD;
of ambition, hope and glory, for one embrace,&#xD;
and esteem myself blest1!"&#xD;
Then Hernando wrestled with himself and&#xD;
endeavored to force down the great selfish&#xD;
spirit that he had called up, endeavored to&#xD;
combat with passions that he had strength-&#xD;
ened and nurtured, and stimulated, and felt&#xD;
an intense joy, though a guilty one, when&#xD;
the passions conquered, when his better self&#xD;
sank exhausted, and the inward wrestle was&#xD;
ended with the victory of self, with the con-&#xD;
quest of the human over the divine, the&#xD;
earthly passions over the soul which is part&#xD;
of God. He felt joy,satisfaction, and having&#xD;
convinced himself that his love was trium-&#xD;
phant,sagelyset about considering the means&#xD;
to accomplish his purpose. That Rosa&#xD;
would love him when she knew the fire, the&#xD;
greatness and intensity of his affection, he&#xD;
&#xD;
A L SEc RET,&#xD;
e, had not a doubt. He thought his passion&#xD;
w unconquerable because he had succumbed&#xD;
to it. He imagined his affection invisible&#xD;
e because he had given it the victory. The'&#xD;
h only thing then was secretly to try and gain&#xD;
- Rosa's heart. To blacken Enrique in her&#xD;
d eyes. To play a double part, and be a hypo.&#xD;
e crite. Secretly, all this must be done. But&#xD;
d Enrique's life should be sacred, while his&#xD;
- happiness was destroyed. Now sometimes,&#xD;
, the dark wish fluttered over his mind, that&#xD;
Enrique might have died at Salonga.&#xD;
s   At once, the high tempered youth stopped&#xD;
d in his reflections, and turning back beheld&#xD;
,the ruin and desolation, which the thoughts&#xD;
and passion, that had swept over his inner&#xD;
- man, left behind. Beheld every high feel-&#xD;
- ing and lofty emotion dead, extinguished,&#xD;
and his whole soul usurped by the fiery and&#xD;
wild flashes of his love for Rosa. Beheld&#xD;
every duty, honor, honesty and brotherly&#xD;
love paling and evaporating, because treach-&#xD;
ery and deceit could serve his love better.&#xD;
" A b," he murmured, "what will I be driv-&#xD;
en to! A murderer I had almost become; a,&#xD;
traitor and hypocrite to my brother, who is&#xD;
- so great, gentle and noble, I am about to be-&#xD;
come. What further yet? Ah, all thi is&#xD;
but slight sacrifice. I would burn my heart&#xD;
with every bright thought, and all of noble.&#xD;
ness and divine spirit, which I have yet left,&#xD;
could I mount in their smoke to thy love,&#xD;
Rosa !"&#xD;
" Hernando, my brother," said Enrique&#xD;
approaching, "why do you walk alone mut-&#xD;
tering as if King Saul's evil spirit were in&#xD;

some pebbles and small stones that were&#xD;
heaped about there, and unearthed the&#xD;
precious steelen casket, in which the proofs&#xD;
of the Prior di Castro's legitimacy were&#xD;
contained.&#xD;
When the guard returned to Lisbon, the&#xD;
King heard with doubt and vexation their&#xD;
story about Massor's power of belching&#xD;
forth fire. However, the gipsy was only of&#xD;
importance as the possessor of the casket,&#xD;
and the King now held the very documents,&#xD;
that had given him so much uneasiness, in&#xD;
his hand. He hastened to deposit them in&#xD;
the strongest and most secret closet he&#xD;
knew - in the closet where the papal bulls,&#xD;
the royal wills, marriage contracts and&#xD;
papers of like importance were kept. Now&#xD;
King Juan again was firm upon the throne&#xD;
of his fathers.&#xD;
And Massor! Do you see the man who&#xD;
stands solitary in the pale gray of morning,&#xD;
under the sleepy green trees at the slope of&#xD;
the hill? It is Massor; alone with his&#xD;
thoughts, he leans against the knotty and&#xD;
warty trunk of a chestnut, the empty bottle&#xD;
still grasped in his hand.&#xD;
1 "This, then, is t'e end of my power over&#xD;
King Juan, " he said. " I could not help it.&#xD;
'T is vain for human wit and human power&#xD;
to strive against Providence. Providence&#xD;
has doomed this nation, has cursed it, and&#xD;
it is, it will be unhappy, unfortunate.-&#xD;
Again a scheme has failed. Again a plan&#xD;
has been destroyed. Well, I have the Kings&#xD;
word.- a shallow, empty promise truly, but&#xD;
still a promise-that the Inquisition should&#xD;
be suspended for two weeks. They must be&#xD;
back by that time-then we will unmask&#xD;
the institution, we will tear away its veil of&#xD;
holiness? Will they retain it? Will Juan,&#xD;
will Portugal remain blind in spite of the&#xD;
sun ? No, it can not be; sense, reason can&#xD;
not allow it. Then we will triumph! Peace&#xD;
will dwell again with us. Oh, scarce have&#xD;

Oh, misfortune never comes alone. Good&#xD;

Thus that mysterious ;man stood, re-&#xD;
&#xD;
CoUNTEEaPLOTs.                     135&#xD;
fleeting and reflecting until the multitude&#xD;
of thoughts dimmed his mind; dreaming&#xD;
of great purposes to be achieved, and&#xD;
noble ends to be reached, searching for&#xD;
means, for ways to achieve them, and still&#xD;
meeting icy failure on every road and in&#xD;
every attempt; thus he stood in middle&#xD;
age on broken hopes and lost years, still&#xD;
failing to grasp his wished for end, to reach&#xD;
his glorious goal.&#xD;
How many do thus'live, and die at last&#xD;
without the achievment of their purpose ?&#xD;
We know not. But in the dark undereur-&#xD;
rents of history we find the remains of&#xD;
glorious plans, the ruins of lofty attempts,&#xD;
which were never known by cotemporaries,&#xD;
and the originators of which lie unremem-&#xD;
bered in some humble grave. Every system&#xD;
has had its  martyrs. Its martyrs that&#xD;
marched in the van and died, that it&#xD;
might come into existence, and the mirtyra&#xD;
that followed in the rear, and died that .it&#xD;
might continue to exist. Some of these&#xD;
martyrs we know, and honor their memory..&#xD;
Most of them have died - died, to be for-&#xD;
gotten. No human institution has ever&#xD;
flourished without being fed with blood,&#xD;
has ever fallen without burying men under&#xD;
its ruins. Massor, as yet, is a riddle. But&#xD;
he is a grand riddle. And when at last he&#xD;
will solve the mystery, the solution will be&#xD;
greater even than the riddle.  . -&#xD;
The morning broke; oh how beautiful,&#xD;
dewy, fresh and glorious. Golden threads&#xD;
stole through the gray woof of the early&#xD;
shadows, and formed brilliant combinations&#xD;
with the fresh living hues of heaven and&#xD;
earth. The happy green trees, the laughing&#xD;
rollicking skies, the flashing water, oh&#xD;
how I love them at early morn.&#xD;
Massor seemed again awakened to life&#xD;
by the invigorating'breeze of morning. He&#xD;
slowly walked from the trees, amidst which&#xD;
he had taken refuge the night before, and,&#xD;
drawing his hat down into his face, walked&#xD;
towards Belem.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
TREE RIvALs.&#xD;
Love is of two kinds. Calm, earnest and&#xD;
deep love. And warm passionate love. The&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7223-00000069"/>&#xD;
136                        THE    FATA&#xD;
first is true, the latter not. True love will&#xD;
never use grand expressions, will never&#xD;
manifest itself in a rolling and talkative&#xD;
tongue. On the contrary. Less words are&#xD;
perhaps exchanged with the objectof true&#xD;
love, than with any other person. Those&#xD;
words are generally common place. Still&#xD;
there is an attraction towards each other in&#xD;
the parties, sudden, inexplicable.  When&#xD;
together, each trembles, grows pale, blushes&#xD;
and is awed in turn. When hearing of the&#xD;
loved object, the same phenomena occur.&#xD;
It is an exquisite tenderness, an extra-&#xD;
vagant friendship, a holy admiration which&#xD;
elevates and purifies the heart. But only&#xD;
the heart - not the manners, expressions&#xD;
and figure. For having no material in-&#xD;
gredients it acts not upon material nature&#xD;
It calms rather then disturbs the rythm of&#xD;
the soul. It is so spiritual that it can exist&#xD;
at the same time with a gross earthly&#xD;
passion, and desire for another object, yet&#xD;
be not disturbed by it. It is divine, there-&#xD;
fore everlasting. It is the perfect agreement&#xD;
and harmony of two souls. True love seeks&#xD;
to hide its emotions. It never paints to the&#xD;
world what the heart enjoys, never speaks&#xD;
of what the soul feels.&#xD;
We speak now of other love. It is not&#xD;
gross desire, but far, far above it. It is a&#xD;
fiery admiration, a passionate attraction, a&#xD;
vain-glorious sentiment. Yea a sentiment to&#xD;
which vanity, self-love, and a desire of con-&#xD;
quest each furnish theiringredient. It is a&#xD;
violent stimulant, an inebriating emotion.&#xD;
It desires, it must have. It will conquer&#xD;
every honorable, moral and religious ob-&#xD;
stacle.&#xD;
A vain-glorious passion like this, though&#xD;
somewhat mingled with the purer, higher&#xD;
love treated of before, was the affection of&#xD;
the old knights. Noble and valiant cheval.&#xD;
iers, that maintained their lady's beauty at&#xD;
the swords point, and proclaimed her favor,&#xD;
heralded the mystery of the kiss and em-&#xD;
brace in all lists and courts throughout&#xD;
Christendom.&#xD;
It is needless to apply this rule to odr&#xD;
characters. All will have classed Enrique&#xD;
amowg the first, Hernando and Miguel&#xD;
among the latter kind of lovers before this.&#xD;
&#xD;
L SECRET,&#xD;
Soon Rosa was well enough to leave the&#xD;
cabin, and sit in the quarterdeck, enjoying:&#xD;
the cool sea breeze. She was. happy,. and&#xD;
every one knows what a capital remedy,&#xD;
happiness is; it soon restored the healthy'&#xD;
tint of Rosa's complexion, relighted the fire,&#xD;
of her eyes and the bright coral of her lips.,&#xD;
Hernando was more than ever in love&#xD;
with  his brother's betrothed.  He now&#xD;
sought, and often found chances to talk alone&#xD;
with Rosa. Yet when Enrique was by, his&#xD;
manner was so calm and tranquil, his con-&#xD;
versation so respectful and brotherly in his&#xD;
tenor; when he was alone with Enrique, his&#xD;
praises of his brother's choice were so un-&#xD;
selfish, so amicable, and without the least&#xD;
spice of passion, that all suspicion was .dis-&#xD;
armed, and Enrique firmly believed Her-&#xD;
nando had never loved Rosa, and only at-&#xD;
tacked his life at Salonga in , a it of delirium&#xD;
and madness. This occurrence itself was&#xD;
never again mentioned, or even hinted at,&#xD;
between the brothers. Enrique had for-&#xD;
given the act, and Hernando tried to forget it.&#xD;
However, in Rosa's company alone, since&#xD;
the Duteh sailors around were no obstacle to&#xD;
their conversation in Portuguese, there was&#xD;
a warmth and passion in Hernando's words,&#xD;
which alarmed the pure hearted maiden.&#xD;
But since that passion presented itself not in&#xD;
a definite form, since Hernando rather hinted&#xD;
at than directly spoke of love, and even then&#xD;
never as of his own, such conversation could&#xD;
not be objected to. He had a rich voice, and&#xD;
often used to amuse the passengers by singing&#xD;
ancient balladsin the starry hoursof evening.&#xD;
Till now, he had not been able to arrange&#xD;
it that Rosa and himself should meet alone&#xD;
at evening. But such a chance at length&#xD;
occurred. Enrique was in the cabin. Mi-&#xD;
guel had now so far recovered from his&#xD;
exhaustion and' broken limb that the phy-&#xD;
sician ordered him to be allowed the liberty&#xD;
of the deck. Enrique had, therefore, gone&#xD;
to speak to him first. We shall detail their&#xD;
conversation hereafter. The captain was&#xD;
occupied in writing; Misardo and Modestus&#xD;
were still confined to their hammocks; Maria&#xD;
stood on the forecastle engaged in a con-&#xD;
fidential chat with Jossdpo, the handsome&#xD;
boatswain, and Moses ben Moses, the physi-&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
OK, PLOTS AND COUNT EnPLOT'S.&#xD;
&#xD;
eia, lay on the quarterdeck musically snor&#xD;
ing. So Hernando    found himself alon&#xD;
with Rosa.&#xD;
The sky was so grandly blue, the se&#xD;
so vast and mysterious, the sparks of the&#xD;
waves so glittering, and every star so lofty&#xD;
and white, that the very atmosphere of th(&#xD;
night breathed softness, beauty and love.&#xD;
Hernando again spoke in his warm strain&#xD;
of conversation to Rosa, until his remarks&#xD;
and protestations, almost oppressed her. I&#xD;
seemed to her as if a cloud floated above&#xD;
from which some evil could every momen&#xD;
descend on her head. To change the subject&#xD;
Rosa asked him to sing. Hernando, there&#xD;
fore, took the lute which he had brought&#xD;
on deck, and sweeping with masterly skil&#xD;
across the strings so as to produce a rush&#xD;
of melody, threw  back his shining hair&#xD;
looked with inspired eyes up to the starry&#xD;
sky,'and began, in a voice powerful, deel&#xD;
and rich, to sing an ancient ballad, which&#xD;
he had long selected for an occasion liki&#xD;
this. The fine sounds were thrilling witl&#xD;
the emotion, the truth of feeling, whicl&#xD;
the singer poured out with them, and were&#xD;
well calculated, together with the subject o.&#xD;
the ballad, to touch Rosa's heart.&#xD;
Eduardo count of Alsantar&#xD;
Did love Elise the fair,&#xD;
Elise the pale, the matchless one,&#xD;
The lady of Calaire.&#xD;
Her eyes were flame, her hair like night&#xD;
Her features pale as snow;&#xD;
And many lands had fair Elise&#xD;
And many suitors too.&#xD;
And yet she liked the valiant Count&#xD;
And promised him her hand;&#xD;
The count was then the happiest man&#xD;
Of any in the land.&#xD;
And many to the wedding came,-&#xD;
And came among the rest,&#xD;
The brother of the valiant count,&#xD;
Alphonse, of knights the best.&#xD;
And when he saw the beauteous bride,&#xD;
In satin and in gold;&#xD;
,The. brightness of his cheek was gone,&#xD;
And paled his glances bold.&#xD;
And though he strove and struggled sore,&#xD;
He gaitied no rest, no peace,&#xD;
For Alphonse loved with all his heart,&#xD;
The beautiful Elise.&#xD;
He met her in the garden lone,&#xD;
And trembling said: Oh stay.&#xD;
1 8&#xD;
&#xD;
I'll tell thee of the fiery love,&#xD;
e   That eats my life away.&#xD;
'Tis thou I love, Elise, 'tis thou,&#xD;
a   Have mercy with my pain;&#xD;
And say that thou wilt fly with me&#xD;
To countries far from Spain.&#xD;
e   Oh, tell me that thy heart replies&#xD;
To feelings true as these;&#xD;
Oh say thou wilt be ever mine-&#xD;
Mine own, my loved Elise.&#xD;
The lady raised in scorn her eyes,&#xD;
Her lip of scarlet curled:&#xD;
Thou know'st I am thy brother's bride,&#xD;
t   In sight of God and World;&#xD;
t   Thou cast not offer wealth and rank&#xD;
.   No counties broad and wide,&#xD;
S   And therefore, though I love thee well,&#xD;
I'll never be thy bride.&#xD;
And though I love your brother not,&#xD;
I'll be his countess high !&#xD;
And so she turned away again&#xD;
With scorn in voice and eye.&#xD;
P   And gaily smiled the golden sun,&#xD;
And sweetly sang the breeze;&#xD;
And chirping notes of merry birds&#xD;
h   Were falling fromthe trees.&#xD;
'And Alphonse looked one more at her,&#xD;
Oh, wildly throbbed his heart!&#xD;
He stabbed himself with shining sword,&#xD;
f To still his throbbing heart.&#xD;
And when the lady saw the corpse,&#xD;
She beat her aching breast;&#xD;
All night, all day Alphonse's ghost&#xD;
Would never let her rest,&#xD;
Until she took the sable veil-.&#xD;
Became a nun for aye;&#xD;
And humbly knelt in holy church,&#xD;
For sinful.souls to pray.&#xD;
This simple and rude ballad was supg&#xD;
with such splendor of voice, such depth of&#xD;
expression, that Rosa leant her head upon&#xD;
her hands, and her tears flowed silently&#xD;
through them. Hernando himself was so&#xD;
much affected by it,that big tears rolled from&#xD;
his eyes.&#xD;
"Donna Rosa," he said in a voice trem-&#xD;
bling with passion, "do you not pity the&#xD;
poor knight Alphonse, and regret the cruel-&#xD;
ty of the lady?"&#xD;
"I pity Alphonse's fate ; the .lady was&#xD;
wrong to, marry for wealth and rank, but&#xD;
after being betrothed to his brother could&#xD;
not but reject him."&#xD;
" Yet she loved him. Oh, Rosa let me&#xD;

What did Rosa think, what did she re-&#xD;
solve upon, in the perplexing condition, to&#xD;
which Hernindo's passion brought her?&#xD;
Tell her bethrothed, she could not. For,&#xD;
like an evil wind, the recollection of Her-&#xD;
nando's words, 'I'll stab him,' swept over&#xD;
her heat, whenever that idea presented it-&#xD;
Elf. ' That threat, so terrible, so probable&#xD;
in its execution, so in harmony with Her-&#xD;
nando's character and passion, was not only&#xD;
aa effectual preventive of Rosa's confiding&#xD;
into Enrique, regarding this matter, but&#xD;
also served to frighten the anxious bride&#xD;
into an at least apparent attention to the&#xD;
words and protestations of the passionate&#xD;
young muau. At one moment she thought of&#xD;
coniding into her mother-but no! Enrique&#xD;
might get knowledge of it then, he would&#xD;
not be silent, and then Hernando might&#xD;
execute his threatI It was not possible to&#xD;
trust the secret to any one. And, where-&#xD;
tore, should she? After her marriage, when&#xD;
Ifernando would perceive the utter folly of&#xD;
is misplaced affection, and the vanity of&#xD;
his hopes, he would abandon those wild&#xD;
thoughts and wishes, would cease to per.&#xD;
secute her. Till then there was no help.&#xD;
She must. endure, and endure patiently&#xD;
as possible.&#xD;
Enrique joined his brother, shortly after-&#xD;
ward. His eyes were beaming, oh so bright-&#xD;
ly, with happiness and gayety. His face&#xD;
was radiant, as if bathed in a beam of&#xD;
pupshine and love. His dress of snowy&#xD;
white satin, edged with broad rich crimson&#xD;
ad laced with gold, became well the happy&#xD;
occssion and Enrique's joyous face. He laid&#xD;
his hand covered with a glove of soft white&#xD;
leathmr,upon Hernando's arm, and looked at&#xD;
bis brother for a time in silence. Hernando&#xD;
was attired in orange velvet, embroidered&#xD;
and laced with silver. He answered Enri-&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
a  SaaoR ET,&#xD;
quo's look by a smile of sweetest: affection.&#xD;
"Brother," said Enrique, "you' see my&#xD;
happiness. It is more than I deserve."&#xD;
" Ah, Enrique! you know that I have no&#xD;
ambition but to see you happy. You weie&#xD;
made for it.' You can enjoy it. But I, I&#xD;
could not content myself. I should find joy&#xD;
such as yours but a dull mistress." 1&#xD;
"Tastes and capacities of enjoying happi-&#xD;
ness are as various and unequal as the&#xD;
means to acquire it. Yet, my Hernando, I&#xD;
often marvel that you have not yet selected&#xD;
a partner for life. You have always been&#xD;
an admirer of the fair sex."   -&#xD;
"All will come in due time, Enrique.&#xD;
You are happy now. Wait until I choose,&#xD;
and we will see who has made the best&#xD;
bargain with fate."&#xD;
. " Oh, I do not fear to compare my bride&#xD;
with any you may wed, or, indeed, with&#xD;
any lady in existence. Don Lionel has not&#xD;
yet arrived. Do you think he will come ?"&#xD;
" Aye, aye. There are his pages with the&#xD;
lion of Judah and the star of Israel on&#xD;
their sleeves.  And now himself enters.&#xD;
Majestic and serious as ever. "&#xD;
Both brothers hastened forward to wel-&#xD;
come Don Lionel Dian with the greatest&#xD;
reverence.&#xD;
A smile of ineffable brightness fitted for&#xD;
a moment over the pale, majestic features of&#xD;
this great scion of Judah's royal race. It&#xD;
was the smile of one who had known&#xD;
earthly joys and felt their sweetness; of one&#xD;
who had seen those joys burst in his grasp ;&#xD;
it was the transient gladness of one who had&#xD;
blown glorious bubbles of human happiness,&#xD;
and seen the air lift them beyond his reach.&#xD;
" I congratulate you, young gentleman, on&#xD;
your choice," said the Hebrew prince. "It&#xD;
is a proper reward at the hands of Him in&#xD;
whose cause you have so often suffered and&#xD;
triumphed. By your management in Rome,&#xD;
you have gained peace for us all, happiness&#xD;
for yourself."&#xD;
" My lord, you honor us so muich by your&#xD;

"Ha, we shall see as to that," exclaimed&#xD;
the latter, nerved by that despairing cour-&#xD;

"Your life be upon your own head&#xD;

drawing his dagger, plunged it into the&#xD;
miser's breast. The latter fell to the floor,&#xD;
the blood spurting from the wound. He&#xD;
essayed to rise, but again the cruel dagger&#xD;
struck him down. With his eyes turned&#xD;
upon the assassin for mercy, and the little&#xD;

The servant retired.                   "I will go, at any rate," he said, "but&#xD;

On, PLoTs AND&#xD;
of male vanity, that he resolved upon firmly&#xD;
but gently to reject every advance of his un-&#xD;
known admirer, and to break her hopes, but,&#xD;
with a soft hand. Vanity, and indeed the&#xD;
desire to see and know her who loved him,&#xD;
decided him to keep the appointment and&#xD;
meet the unknown.&#xD;
There is nothing like evening, nothing&#xD;
like sunset. When I say nothing, I mean&#xD;
in external nature. For there is something&#xD;
very like it as the end of life, at the death of&#xD;
man. When the good man dies, the sun of&#xD;
the soul once more blazes up, and its rays&#xD;
are reflected from the bright glory of his&#xD;
life. Red love, golden piety, purple wisdom,&#xD;
white innocence, azure charity and modesty,&#xD;
green hope floating like a veil, over the rest,&#xD;
all, all colors, all sentiments, burn in bright.&#xD;
ness upon the clouds, whose dark face, his&#xD;
course of life has changed to light. When'&#xD;
the wicked man dies, the sun throws flakes&#xD;
of feverish light, blushes of hectic gold upon&#xD;
dark clouds that might have beenbrightened&#xD;
- that have remained dark. Those streaks&#xD;
of light but show the darkness, that hectic&#xD;
lush is but the sign of internal disease.-&#xD;
The wicked man's dissolution seems like the&#xD;
dissolution of day in a thunderstorm.-&#xD;
Where the gold 6f piety has given way to&#xD;
lightning flashes of remorse, and the gor-&#xD;
geous sky to clouds of despair. Is not the&#xD;
death of man like sunset? His life in this&#xD;
world like the busy, selfish, troublesome,&#xD;
day ? His life hereafter like the sweet, calm&#xD;
night.  *   *    *    *   We return to&#xD;
Lisbon.-&#xD;
The day put on its many colored dressing&#xD;
gown, shed its golden eyelashes, and sank to&#xD;
sleep on the dark bosom of the Atlantic&#xD;
ocean.&#xD;
Hernando entered the beggars' square.-&#xD;
It was a street renowned for assemblies of&#xD;
the beggars, and, even now groups of them&#xD;
reclined, stood, or sat in thick profusion,&#xD;
upon the pavement. Some were counting&#xD;
the coins they had been able to gather dur-&#xD;
ing the day. Others were relating their ex-&#xD;
periences, and the success of their own pe-&#xD;
culiar manner of begging. Still others dis.&#xD;
cussed the topics of the day-the King, the&#xD;
Queen, the Emperor,India,Asia,the Cardinal&#xD;
&#xD;
COUN TER PLOTS.                   147&#xD;
Savelli, and other subjects like these. Mis-&#xD;
erable beings.in rags and tatters they were,&#xD;
their bodies wrapped in soiled and torn&#xD;
remnants of clothes, their features display.-&#xD;
ing'darkened and broken tracks of human&#xD;
minds and hearts - displaying human vice,&#xD;
in all its disgusting nakedness. When the&#xD;
bright flame in -man's heart and mind dies,&#xD;
nought but smoke and ashes remain.-.--&#xD;
These beggars made an immediate rush&#xD;
at the richly clad stranger entering their&#xD;
square, and Hernando had much trouble to&#xD;
free himself of their importunate entreaties&#xD;
by a plenteous donation of silver coin.&#xD;
He reached the Hostelrie of the Santa&#xD;
Madre., A picture of the Virgin Mary in a&#xD;
Spanish mantilla, standing, with giant feet&#xD;
upon a heap of doughy clouds, and lifting&#xD;
two hands loaded with rings, towards a&#xD;
streak of dirty yellow, designed to represent&#xD;
heaven, was the glory of the inn. This&#xD;
picture occupied the center of the front, and&#xD;
was flanked on each side, by a window.-&#xD;
The windows that had the honor to guard&#xD;
the Virgin Mary,.were both open, and a fe-&#xD;
male figure stood near one of them. When&#xD;
Hernando approached the small private door&#xD;
of the inn, this figure quickly disappeared.&#xD;
In another moment he had knocked and was&#xD;
admitted by the burly man that had brought&#xD;
the note, and who was the innkeeper. He&#xD;
escorted the young nobleman to a chamber&#xD;
in the second story, and left him alone with&#xD;
a lady, that rose on his entrance.&#xD;
"Senor, you are welcome," said the lady.&#xD;
"Donna Miranda! Is it.indeed you that&#xD;
have favored me with the note?" inquired&#xD;
Hernando.&#xD;
"It is senor; I am happy that you are&#xD;
come. You see I was awaiting you."&#xD;
" A h, senora, and what is it, that you wish&#xD;
to communicate to me ? If I can aid you by&#xD;
word or deed in anything, rely on pe."&#xD;
"1It is not to ask for aid that ladies invite&#xD;
young gallants to meet them alone, and se-&#xD;
eretly in a strange house," replied Donna&#xD;
Miranda, impatiently. "It is for-, d9es&#xD;
not 'your heart tell you senor? Do you not&#xD;
kriow what it is to love?"&#xD;
"My heart is silent, senora. I know what&#xD;
it is to love, but, Donna Miranda is the wife&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7223-00000075"/>&#xD;
On, PLOTS AND COUT.raLOTS.       I49&#xD;
&#xD;
of Don Isidore. I dare not mention love in&#xD;
the presence of another's wife."&#xD;
" Dare not," cried the lady, contemptuous-&#xD;
ly; "dare not? A man, whose breast is full&#xD;
of youth and fire, dares to do every thing."&#xD;
"Except an act of dishonor."&#xD;
"Dishonor! The wife'shand and fortune&#xD;
are the husband's; her heart not always.-&#xD;
The heart is free ! Or have I mistaken Don&#xD;
Hernando da Costa. Are his fiery eye and&#xD;
bold brow, his proud form and quick grace&#xD;
but the frame of a weak, soft and ungallant&#xD;
spirit ? If so, our interview is ended."&#xD;
"1Had a man said this, he had died for it,"&#xD;
returned Hernando. "Senora, my soul is&#xD;
fiery and bold, my blood warm and youth-&#xD;
ful, but--"&#xD;
"Enough, then; come! " and Miranda&#xD;
seized his hand and drew the young man to&#xD;
the window, where a bright mass of moon-&#xD;
shine streamed in. Till now her head,&#xD;
shoulders, and the upper part of her body&#xD;
had'been wrapped in a Spanish mantilla of&#xD;
thick black lace. But now, with a sudden&#xD;
movement she threw this half veil, half cloak&#xD;
off, at the same time disengaging a shawl&#xD;
worn beneath. Miranda then stood in the&#xD;
bright moolight, attired in a robe of black&#xD;
satin, edged and embroidered with gold.-&#xD;
Her snowy neck and dark, heavy hair; her&#xD;
soft, black eyes, full, rich lips, and features&#xD;
of a-beauty enchantingly charming; her&#xD;
brow and cheeks flushed with soft blushes;&#xD;
all enhanced by the effect of her black and&#xD;
gold robe, were displayed before Hernando's&#xD;
eyes,in the bewitching moonshine.&#xD;
"Look at me !" sighed rather than said&#xD;
the beautiful lady.&#xD;
The young man's eyes drank in her soft&#xD;
beauty. -.Still he moved not, spoke not, but&#xD;
by calling up his resolve, again and again,&#xD;
callingup thejmage of Rosa, prevented him-&#xD;
self from falling at the lady's feet in admira-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"And I love you, love you," continued&#xD;
Miranda, bending toward Hernando, and&#xD;
letting her softbreath sweep over his cheek.&#xD;
"It is too much,"faintly faltered the young&#xD;
man, every glance melting his resolve.&#xD;
"Ilove you, sinc6-  no matter how longI&#xD;
-   I love you now.--Come to my bosom-&#xD;
&#xD;
oh; I am thirsting, thirstingifor your love."&#xD;
With a strong effort Hernando recovered&#xD;
- himself.&#xD;
1  "Senora, this is not seemly for me. Your&#xD;
beauty would tempt me to do what I should&#xD;
repent of. Let me-"&#xD;
"Oh," cried kiranda, in rage, stamping&#xD;
her foot, "I shall go madI He is ice, a being&#xD;
of ice. ;Senor, do I understand you to say&#xD;
that you refuse my love?"&#xD;
Her eye was threatening, full of immense&#xD;
wrath as she said this.   "I&#xD;
" Senora, I can not, believe me, I can not&#xD;
return your passion. I love-- "&#xD;
"Enough, senorI Enough, disgrace to be&#xD;
heaped on the heart of a woman who loves.&#xD;
I thought you were a man. You are a child.&#xD;
We are enemies in future I You have re-&#xD;
fused my love-my hate shall follow you-&#xD;
aye, my hate, which is not so despicable as&#xD;
you think perhaps now. Good heaven - I&#xD;
thought to revel in fire, and have approached&#xD;
a bosom colder than the aged limbs of my&#xD;
husband! Away, senorI Away with youI&#xD;
Your manner has maddened me. Believe&#xD;
me, an unsatisfied, a rejected heart can hate&#xD;
terribly.'"'&#xD;
As she stood there in fierce anger, Her-&#xD;
nando thought her beauty even greater than&#xD;
before.  Her eyes burned, her cheeks&#xD;
were a glow, her form dilated, and her whole&#xD;
appearance was terribly beautiful. He was&#xD;
about to throw himself at her tfeet- seizing&#xD;
her hand, he knelt, he drew her toward him,&#xD;
when the lady cried:&#xD;
-"Do you add scoffs to insult, scorn to re-&#xD;
jection ? " and lifting her arm in a threaten-&#xD;
ing manner she left the apartment.&#xD;
Hernando was glad of it. He was happy&#xD;
to have been put beyond temptation. He&#xD;
was sure, had she stayed a moment longer&#xD;
he would have given all earth up for her.&#xD;
Even now, his blood run swiftly through his&#xD;
veins and arteries, and his pulses were&#xD;
throbbing. Even now, his nerves trembled&#xD;
in hungry desire. Even now his heart beat&#xD;
with passion, mad passion.&#xD;
However, Miranda had left. This beau-&#xD;
tiful being had left him in anger. For this&#xD;
he cared little, and, while making his way&#xD;
out of the inn and home, layed his heroism,&#xD;
&#xD;
his fortitude in withstanding these tempta-&#xD;
tions, a soothing balm upon his regretting&#xD;
breast.&#xD;
And Miranda ? She had scarcely returned&#xD;
home when a paroxism of mad passion and&#xD;
anger seized her.  Every mirror flashed&#xD;
back her splendid beauty, every mirror re-&#xD;
flected her shame. For she was still at-&#xD;
tired in the atin robe, particularly selected&#xD;
to enhance her charms in'Hernando's eyes.&#xD;
So she had failedI Had made the first ad-&#xD;
vances, had confessed her love, had urged it&#xD;
upon Hernando, tried all the, charms of&#xD;
her person and manner, and'still been---&#xD;
rejected, scornfully rejected as she believed.&#xD;
And also failed in satisfying her craving&#xD;
and wild passion.&#xD;
There is, there can not be, as the poet&#xD;
has ju'stly observed, in hell a fury like a&#xD;
woman scorned. No other insult is like-it,&#xD;
no other insult awakens so much rage. In&#xD;
a nature like Miranda's, who was a pro-&#xD;
ficient in hate as in love, who had lived in&#xD;
courts, where both these passions assumed&#xD;
their worst forms, who had served Madame&#xD;
Luise de Savoy, mother of the French king,&#xD;
hate grew terribly strong and quick.&#xD;
Miranda had   learned  at the  French&#xD;
courts how to hate according to a system.&#xD;
She would not wait for chance or fortune&#xD;
to satisfy her hate, but would, of herself,&#xD;
begin the work, and endeavor to destroy&#xD;
Hernando immediately. Knowing nothing&#xD;
of his character, manners, ways, relations,&#xD;
she resolved that destroyed he must be, and&#xD;
already plans to that effect haunted her&#xD;
mind.&#xD;
Let us leave this character, bold and bad,&#xD;
but characteristic of the times. It is the&#xD;
duty of a novelist to exhibit vice in all&#xD;
shapes, all excesses, in which it indulged in&#xD;
the times, or countries he describes. His&#xD;
task would be but half done, were he to&#xD;
present bright, glorious men, and cast a,&#xD;
veil over vice and sin. The times I describe&#xD;
were passion stained and rich in vice. I&#xD;
have painted, occasionally, in dark colors&#xD;
but rather let my picture be displeasing&#xD;
than untruthfuL  Miranda'is a character, a&#xD;

tury, and I have not hesitated to do her&#xD;
&#xD;
justice, both in describing her vices and&#xD;
merits. Has the reader's delicacy been of-&#xD;
fended, it is well; for the evidence of a&#xD;
pure heart is to feel repugnance to .vice ;&#xD;
and this picture will have the effect of&#xD;
strengthening the love of virtue in pure&#xD;
hearts, since no gloss is thrown over the&#xD;

CHAPT-ER       XLII.&#xD;
"HELL HAS NO FU RY LIKE A wo-&#xD;
MAN SCORNED.i'.&#xD;
The clock strikes twelve; the cool night&#xD;
wind bears the silvery sounds far over the&#xD;
green tops of Mount Cintra. The village of&#xD;
Belem is silent and dark, with the excep-&#xD;
tion of the steeple of Maria Annunciata,&#xD;
which, all bathed in moonshine,points to the&#xD;
azure sky.&#xD;
However, a close observer might have&#xD;
seen a golden thread of light struggling fro&amp;amp;&#xD;
the closed shutters that barred the windows&#xD;
opening from the vaults of the inn, Saint&#xD;
Ignatio.  Again, dark, and dusky forms,&#xD;
muffled in cloaks, were skulking along the&#xD;
streets from the river, and the highway,&#xD;
keeping in the shadows of the walls and&#xD;
trees that they might remain unobserved.-&#xD;
As each approached the inn, he kissed his&#xD;
hand, and then pressed it against a small&#xD;
tin case (fij~tt) placed on the door post,&#xD;
when the portal swung open, and the person&#xD;
entered, taking the precaution to shut the&#xD;
door after him. All but a few stragglers&#xD;
had entered; amongst them we recognize two&#xD;
figures. The one, in hat and coak, hastily&#xD;
striding along, and seemingly buried in his&#xD;
thought, was Hernando da Costa. The&#xD;
other in the dress of a gay page, with white&#xD;
plume concealing the- face, and sweeping&#xD;
down upon the shoulders, is Miranda. - For&#xD;
the proud lady had assumed that dress, for&#xD;
the purpose of concealment while watching&#xD;
Hernando. "No man's life is pure," she&#xD;
thought, "and, if well observed, we may&#xD;
find a weak point, in every ones character,&#xD;
wherefrom to attack him successfully.--&#xD;
And, since I wish to ruin Hernando, I must&#xD;
first of all ascertain that weak point, This&#xD;
can only be done by a close system of obser-&#xD;
vation. But my passion, and my hate is&#xD;

my chambermaid and myself, Therefore,&#xD;
my cham.abermaid shall watch him in dis-&#xD;
guise, and, occasionally I myself shall fol-&#xD;
low him." She acted accordingly, and now,&#xD;
in the disguise of a page, followed the un-&#xD;
concious Hernando to the secret meeting of&#xD;
the Israelites,'&#xD;
Imitating the example of the others, she&#xD;
pressed against the small tin case, and found&#xD;
that the clasp which fastened it to the post,&#xD;
contained a spring, a pressure on which un-&#xD;
looked the door She entered through some&#xD;
dark vaults, into the large and well lighted&#xD;
ball, which served the Israelites, as a house&#xD;
of worship and council, whenever they could&#xD;
safely meet. From friend to friend, from&#xD;
Israelite to Israelite, amongst the nobilty&#xD;
and the commons, at court, in the navy,&#xD;

houses and places of businessthe announce-&#xD;

by Jewish tongue to Jewish ear, that a grand&#xD;
meeting was to'be held in the hall beneath&#xD;
St Iguatio's inn, and that Don Lionel Dian&#xD;
would preside at thatmeeting.&#xD;
This was the cause of the gathering of&#xD;
the crowd, that now presented itself to the&#xD;
eyes of Miranda.&#xD;
There was a hum of expectation, followed&#xD;
by silence. Don Lionel Dian arose, and&#xD;
spoke:&#xD;
"Brethren I Fellow sufferers in the holy&#xD;
cause I Fellow patriots of Israel, and de-&#xD;
fenders of God's word I At length have we&#xD;
escaped from the danger, and again has the&#xD;
Lord snatched his own from the serpents'&#xD;
toils. We have, with our Gold, wrung from&#xD;
the corrupted, head, of a debased religion,&#xD;
protection for ourselves and families. But&#xD;
the dangerwhich-we have removed, was un-&#xD;
doubtedly brought on us by the anger of the&#xD;
Lord. And wherefore was lie angry with&#xD;
his children? Because Israel had left him,&#xD;
-had deserted his laws had inclined to the&#xD;
doctrines of the Nazarine. And now that&#xD;
the danger is past, will we not return to&#xD;
Him, whoi through all ages, has proved our&#xD;
'tiend, our Father and our God. Yea, Is-&#xD;
'kaelites-I- your prince, and.your own hearts&#xD;
call on you to renounce every strange&#xD;
&#xD;
AL SECRET,&#xD;
thought, to be sanctified, to love your God,&#xD;
to obey his commands.&#xD;
" It is true, that, for the present, the dan&#xD;
ger is averted, but what trust can be put in&#xD;
one, who has already shown himself - to be&#xD;
corrupted. Therefore, be not deluded, the&#xD;
serpent's coils are not yet unwound, but&#xD;
only loosened; at any moment, may they&#xD;
again enfold us in their close embrace and&#xD;
it plung its poisoned fangs deep in our&#xD;
hearts.&#xD;
" Our necessities command, that, in out-&#xD;
ward appearance, we should be Christians,&#xD;
but beware! let your hearts not take a liking&#xD;
to the mask. When aione with yourselves&#xD;
and with your God, strip off the hateful&#xD;
shell, and let theilight stream into your soul;&#xD;
that light which comes from Zion, and beams&#xD;
from the holy MountI Brethren, take'&#xD;
courage, draw your swords, gather together,&#xD;
sons of Israel, the Lord will send his mes-&#xD;
senger, the Messiah!"&#xD;
This speech, full of enthusiasm and holy&#xD;
fire, failed not in effect upon the hearer.-&#xD;
The eyes of the young men flashed, and even&#xD;
the old participated in the excitement Don&#xD;
Lionel Dian, sat down, and now the leaders&#xD;
of Israelites gathered around him, and held&#xD;
council concerning the circumstances of the&#xD;
times, and the measures to be taken for&#xD;
avoiding the cliffs and sandbanks, which&#xD;
still surrounded their race.&#xD;
Before dissolving the meeting,'Don Lionel&#xD;
again arose, and said:&#xD;
" Let those present now depart. On the&#xD;
evening of Monday next, another meeting&#xD;
will be held, and then we shall instruct, ac-&#xD;
cording to our best knowledge, and council,&#xD;
all with our experience of the way to obey&#xD;
his God, while living according to the neces-&#xD;
sities of our exile. Monday evening a reli-&#xD;
gious service will be held, the service of&#xD;
the New Year. Let all, women and men,&#xD;
come to serve their God, and proclaim the&#xD;
Lord one, high and mighty, merciful and&#xD;
just, the humiliator of the proud, and com.&#xD;
forter of the suffering. Meanwhile depart&#xD;
in peace.'&#xD;
The assembled multitude rose, and silent-&#xD;
ly left the hall. None but some of the old-&#xD;
est and wisest Israelites.some learned Rab-&#xD;
&#xD;
ORt, PLOTS     AND&#xD;
bis of the 1mud, and some wealthy and&#xD;
noble leaders of the nation, remained with&#xD;
Don Lionel Dian, to consult on the welfare&#xD;
of the people.I&#xD;
Let us return now, to Miranda, disguised&#xD;
in the dress of a page, who had followed&#xD;
Hernando to the secret assembly of the Is-&#xD;
raelites.&#xD;
She had entered unseen, and placed her-&#xD;
self behind a pillar, some steps from Her-&#xD;
nando, As a matter of course, she saw and&#xD;
heard all that passed. This knowledge&#xD;
hoarded in her bosom she left the hall with&#xD;
the throng, and walked on heedless of the'&#xD;
direction. In a few moments her thoughts&#xD;
reverted to present circumstances. She&#xD;
looked around for Hernando and the rest of&#xD;
the Israelites. They were scattered, here&#xD;
and there, returning to the town, or to their&#xD;
habitations in Belem and the surrounding&#xD;
country.&#xD;
"1I will return to the city now," observed&#xD;
Miranda to herself. "I have all I want.-&#xD;
Oh Hernando, you have scorned me! insult-&#xD;
ed me! Revenge is a cooling breeze to the&#xD;
scorched heart, akid I shall have it, satiate&#xD;
myselfI His whole race shall be destroyed!&#xD;
The blood of hundreds will wash this insult&#xD;
from my bosom! And yet he is so hand"&#xD;
some ! so manlyI Ah, if he would but now&#xD;
consent to satisfy my passion, and to accept&#xD;
my love! If he would - but no ! expose&#xD;
myself to repeated scoffs ? He has once re-&#xD;
jected my love -I will reject pity, his&#xD;
nation shall bleed for it."&#xD;
Thus thought Miranda, and battled with&#xD;
herself, as she went along the road to Lis-&#xD;
bon-hard, fatiguing journey for her unus&#xD;
ed to much exertion.   But, the pain pf&#xD;
body, and its fatigue, was as nothing to her,&#xD;
before the thoughts of the mind, the war-&#xD;
ring emotions of the senses. Senses, for we&#xD;
are unable to say whether Miranda's heart&#xD;
was greatly concerned in- her passion for&#xD;
Hernando da Costa.   I&#xD;
- Anger and hate, with love, hopeful in&#xD;
spite-of rejection, were having a great strug-&#xD;
gle in her mind. Finally she had come to a&#xD;
resolve, and stopping for a moment cried:&#xD;
"1Revenge is sweeter yet, and rarely can&#xD;
&#xD;
C O UNTER PL OT..S.              151&#xD;
I enjoy it in such quantity. I will .destroy'&#xD;
them all. Their sentence is spoken."  i&#xD;
And then,she ran with great speed towards&#xD;
Lisbon, whose suburbs were soon reached.&#xD;
The dream-distilling goddess of night-&#xD;
had hung her diadem of stars upon -her&#xD;
azure hair, and spread her dark transparent&#xD;
skirts over the earth. Broad beds of purple&#xD;
blackness and crystal moonshine rolled over&#xD;
the verdant land and corrugated sea. ,A&#xD;
song, like the rushing of the mysterious&#xD;
waves of Eternity's sea, like the billows'of&#xD;
time surging away from the Earth, rocked&#xD;
in the air. It seemed each vast minute&#xD;
could be heard to drop from the earth in&#xD;
the still fanciful night.&#xD;
And through this 'night Miranda borel&#xD;
home to the mansion of her husband, her&#xD;
burden of hate, and her revengeful thoughts.&#xD;
CHAPTER         XLIII.&#xD;
MAN CAN NOT AVERT HIS FATE.&#xD;
No I man can not avert his fate, and there&#xD;
are two grave reasons for it. In the first&#xD;
place, no soothsayer or teller of the future&#xD;
has ever arisen, whose word was author-&#xD;
ized sufficiently to appear in the eyes of&#xD;
men as the absolute flat of fate. Secondly,&#xD;
men recognise events only as fate, after&#xD;
they have happened. A necessary corollary&#xD;
of the position .assumed in the foregoing&#xD;
two sentences is, that man does not know,&#xD;
therefore can not avert his fate.&#xD;
Donna Miranda had been announced,'aid&#xD;
now entered the saloon, in which His Emi-&#xD;
nence, the Cardinal Savelli received -stran-&#xD;
gers. The Secretary of the Cardinal, Pater&#xD;
Domingo, was present, standing behind the&#xD;
chair of his Eminence.&#xD;
"Seat yourself, daughter," said the Car-&#xD;
dinal, calmly, answering Donna Miranda's&#xD;
salutation, by a nod;' "seat yourself, and&#xD;
communicate -wherefore you demand audi-&#xD;
ence with us.   Vt e are -servants of the&#xD;
Church, and our ear I always open to&#xD;
the voice of poor humanity."&#xD;
"It is not to'confess and not to pray, holy&#xD;
Father, that I have craved audience with&#xD;
you," replied Miranda, with some affectation&#xD;
of awe. But, before I begin, let me remark&#xD;

CHAPTER XL VI.&#xD;
THE ESCAPE.&#xD;
All of 'the Israelites had been hurried&#xD;
through a short trial, and many of them con-&#xD;
demned to the stake, some to be maimed&#xD;
and imprisoned, and a few to penitence and&#xD;
banishment. The goods of all, as a matter&#xD;
of course, became the property of the King&#xD;
and the Holy Tribunal. The Cardinal&#xD;
Grand Inquisitor had deputed Pater Domin.&#xD;
go, the secretary, to take possession of the&#xD;
private property of the prisoners, and make&#xD;
a list of it, for the benefit of the royal officers.&#xD;
The. King had entrusted the execution of ta&#xD;
favorite plan to the Cardinal, which thelat-&#xD;
ter also placed under-Domingo's charges It&#xD;
was, to distribute the children of the cog-&#xD;
demoed New Christians on' various African&#xD;
isles, where they might grow up without&#xD;
knowledge of Judaism, and become pious&#xD;
Christian settlers.,&#xD;
Pater Domingo had attended to both these&#xD;
commission. . Ships were. provided which&#xD;
the Pater sewly manned, jn order, as he&#xD;
&#xD;

tion of the royal andf nquisitional orders.-&#xD;
For the character-of the new erewhe vouch.&#xD;
ed.&#xD;
They were drafted from various parts- of,&#xD;
the Kingdom, and with;such celerity,that&#xD;
four days after the trial of the Israelites,&#xD;
each ship was.manned; the children of the&#xD;
Israelites wrre placed on board of one ves-&#xD;
sel, and their most valuable treasures on the&#xD;
other. - The fist to be ,carried to 'African&#xD;
Islands; the latter to be conveyed to the&#xD;
King, who was journeying in the South of&#xD;
Portugal. At that time, even more that&#xD;
now, the conveyance by water was sonsueh&#xD;
better and safer than by land, inPortugal,&#xD;
that things of value and important were&#xD;
generally sent -by ships. - Thereibre,-Pater,&#xD;
Domingo acted'quite honestly in-freighting&#xD;
a vessel with the confiscated treasures'of the&#xD;
condemned Israelites.&#xD;
Onthe evening of the day when they had&#xD;
received their cargo, both vessels stood 'out&#xD;
to sea. The Cardinal Gtand Inquisitor, in&#xD;
very wtrin Wers, expressed his' thanks to&#xD;
Pater Domingo for the dispatch'he had used.&#xD;
There were two other vessels laying be-&#xD;
hind the rocks of Cintra, in a small bay full&#xD;
of dangerous eliffis and sandbanks,' which&#xD;
seemed for some days past to b6waiting the&#xD;
arrival of their cargo. The first was i ship&#xD;
of Dutch make; at its side lay a smalletrone,&#xD;
though also of considerable capacity' The&#xD;
latter had great breath of beam, but a 'light&#xD;
and easy build.&#xD;
They lay at anchor in a bay, wherethey&#xD;
could not be approached, but from which'&#xD;
they could not emerge without- foundering,&#xD;
unless the most skilful of pilots held-the&#xD;
rudde. 'Around them were ragiagbreakers&#xD;
and shallow sandbanks.&#xD;

then replied:&#xD;
" I will answer to the proper authorities,&#xD;

and glAnced out, "You, senor, must answer&#xD;
to the ArchbishopGrand Inquisitor of Spain,&#xD;
for the authority, title and state assumed&#xD;
unauthorised, for the forgeries committed."&#xD;
Savelli turned pale and a livid hue rose to&#xD;
his lips and encircled his eyes.,&#xD;
" What is this?" he stammered.&#xD;
But at that moment the doors were thrown&#xD;
open, and while a lackey announced noisily:&#xD;
"His Eminence the Lord Grand Inquisi-&#xD;
tor of Spain,&#xD;
"His highness the Count of Ildemonte,"&#xD;
two gentlemen entered the apartment. One&#xD;
a priest, the other a soldier. Domingo step-&#xD;
ped toward them, and pointing to the pale&#xD;
nd trembling man, in the ivory chair said,&#xD;
scornfully:&#xD;
",His Eminence the Cardinal Savelli."&#xD;
The soldier who was no other than the&#xD;
Count of Ildemonte, immediately laid his&#xD;
4Wpd on Savelli's shoulder, and said:&#xD;
"Iazpest you in the name of the emperor."&#xD;
Savelli sprang from his chair, as if a ser-&#xD;
pep had stung him. Immediately the Grand&#xD;
Inquisitor then began:&#xD;
"I arrest you, in the name of the holy&#xD;
tribunal.'.'-&#xD;
At the words of the Grand Inquisitor,&#xD;
Savelli stamped his, foot, and uttering a cry,&#xD;
like that of a wild beast when frightened and&#xD;
enraged, cowed down and slunk back before&#xD;
the three, conipsanding figures opposite to&#xD;
him. But this was only in the first moments,&#xD;
bpn; srprise and terror, as the terrible&#xD;
WeXde cf arrest thundered on hisear, had al-&#xD;
most bereft him of his senses,. Savelli was&#xD;
#0a, cqward. On the.contrary, he was bold&#xD;
and resolute, The surprise of the moment,&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;amp;L ,S1CORET,&#xD;
- only, overwhelmed him with damning char.&#xD;

-  He recovered himself in part. And, the&#xD;
consciousness, that boldness only could give&#xD;
- him safety at least for the present, as well&#xD;
as the perception of the ridiculous posture,&#xD;
he occupied, in relation to the other persons&#xD;
present, served to revive all his courage, and&#xD;
even to stimulate it by shame. Erecting his&#xD;
body and lifting his head with anger, bright&#xD;
eye and flushed cheek, he stepped several&#xD;
paces forward, and said:&#xD;
"Inquisitor General of Spain, I know you,&#xD;
and your proud arrogance well! But here,&#xD;
I am Inquisitor General, instituted by the&#xD;
Holy Father, recommended by the Emperor,&#xD;
and accepted by the King of Portugal. Who&#xD;
gives you the right to use such expressions&#xD;
to me. How shall. I understand your beo&#xD;
havior, how interpret your words?"&#xD;
" This pride is not in its place, man," re-&#xD;
plied the Inquisitor.&#xD;
" We have assurances by his Holiness&#xD;
that he has entrusted you with no mission.&#xD;
We have letters from the Emperor. He also&#xD;
has given you no recommendation. The&#xD;
King of Portugal you have deceived. But&#xD;
we have sent messengers to him and his&#xD;
highness will yet arrive in time to judge&#xD;
yout offenses. You have committed heinous&#xD;
offenses. Forgery amongst them."'&#xD;
"You have committed high treason against&#xD;
Carplo V, Emperor of Germany and King&#xD;
of Castile and Arragon. I arrest you in his&#xD;
name."&#xD;
"I protest against these proceedings, my&#xD;
Lord Grand Inquisitor of Spain! My Lord&#xD;
Count of IldemonteI I am a Cardinal, a&#xD;
member of the holy college, and as such only&#xD;
responsible to the head of Christendom. No&#xD;
prince, no prelate can call me to account."&#xD;
" WE call you to account. Increase not&#xD;
your offense by obstinate pride. You are a&#xD;
scoundrel, senor, a rascal, mean as the dirt&#xD;
beneath my feet; I will not soil my fair&#xD;
manners, by further converse with you.-&#xD;
That you have committed forgery, and -as-&#xD;

The chain-of guilt is complete. Had King&#xD;

been a partial shield to you; but, Cardinal&#xD;
Savelli pretended to bear his office from the&#xD;
Holy Father. Senor, thank me for the grace&#xD;
to make this clear to you." Thus spoke the&#xD;
Spanish Count.&#xD;
Savelli's features again fell, and paled be-&#xD;
fore this plain and crushing recital of his&#xD;
guilt, his helplessness, his fall.&#xD;
"Senors," he cried in a. piteous voice,&#xD;
"whatever you have against me, have I not&#xD;
founded the Inquisition in Portugal, not&#xD;
spread the power of the Church and Holy&#xD;
Tribunal? Deserve I not consideration on&#xD;
that account?"&#xD;
The Count of Ildemonte was struck by&#xD;
this argument, and cast a doubtful hesitating&#xD;
look at his companion.&#xD;
Savelli observing it, continued: " My fall&#xD;
will be the fall of the Institution I founded.&#xD;
Let me, therefore, prevail, for its sake. Nay,&#xD;
senors, peacably ye can not possess your-&#xD;
selves of me, in the midst of my familiars,&#xD;
and the city that honors and admires me,-&#xD;
I will resist, if you attempt it."&#xD;
The Count said to the SpanishGrand In-&#xD;
quisitor:&#xD;
" Perhaps his objections merit some con-&#xD;
sideration. The Holy Tribunal must not&#xD;
suffr."I&#xD;
" The Inquisition will remain. But its&#xD;
head may not be impure and corrupt. It&#xD;
will flourish under manner white, pure and&#xD;
just. Not under the flag.of a cheat."&#xD;
With this he sounded a small string of&#xD;
steelen crosses depending from his girdle.-&#xD;
Four Spanish familiars, that had accompa-&#xD;
nied the Grand Inquisitor entered. Savelli&#xD;
attempted to strike his rattle, and summon&#xD;
his attendants. But father Domingo pre-&#xD;
vented him. In a few moments he was bound&#xD;
and gagged. He would have cried, but a&#xD;
hood had been thrown over his head from&#xD;
the first. Domingo opened a secret door,&#xD;
&#xD;
GOU N TE R PLOTS. .&#xD;
and theCardinal was taken away, while the&#xD;
Inquisitor General of Spain took possession&#xD;
of his apartments and papers.&#xD;
The King had arrived in town that morn-&#xD;
ing. In the forenoon yet, reports of Savelli's&#xD;
deceit, the escape of the Israelites, which&#xD;
leaked out quickly, and the disappearance of&#xD;
the vessel with the confiscated treasures&#xD;
reached him. He was convinced by this&#xD;
that treachery had been at work and laid it&#xD;
to Savelli's charge.&#xD;
Meanwhile he sent three fast sailing ves-&#xD;
sels, well armed with cannons, and manned&#xD;
by marines after the fugitives, whose vessels&#xD;
had been observed. at Belem and the coast.&#xD;
The Cardinal's deceit, making him the ridi-&#xD;
cule of all Europe rankled him most. He&#xD;
was almost maddened by it. Some time af-&#xD;
ter, at Savelli's trial, the King revenged hini-&#xD;
self by sentencing the pretended Cardinal&#xD;
and Grand Inquisitor, to ten years -service&#xD;
as a galley slave. The proud adventurer&#xD;
was, in the sight of Lisbon, chained to the.&#xD;
galley bench.  Verily, the vengeance of&#xD;
Kings is terrible.&#xD;
CHAPTER R        XLV III .&#xD;
ATONEMENT      ON   THE   SEA.&#xD;
On sped the two vessels, with the Israelites&#xD;
on board, still they were but slowly making&#xD;
headway. Let us turn to the larger of the&#xD;
two, Captain Sporaso's vessel, for there are&#xD;
the persons that interest us most.&#xD;
All are in white shrouds. Their faces&#xD;
white and pale as the rumpled garments.&#xD;
For food has not passed their lips since the&#xD;
evening before. It is the day of atonement,&#xD;
a day of fasting and prayer, a day of eon-&#xD;
trition and purifying of sins, a day when&#xD;
earth is thrown off, and the soul climbs one&#xD;
more step towards heaven.., Thiqday, the&#xD;
fugitives neglect not in their flight; they&#xD;
keep it holy, thrice holy, because occurring&#xD;
at such an eventful period.&#xD;
The prayers have floated with the ocean&#xD;

&#xD;
Let, us look at some of these men in&#xD;
shrouds, flying from their homes, their loved&#xD;
Portugal.&#xD;
Before the mast, in calm silence, sit a&#xD;
dignified and reverend line of aged men.&#xD;
Here and there a younger nne amongst them&#xD;
too. They observe strict silence, and some&#xD;
are even praying in whispers. The one with&#xD;
the high stately figure, and long beard, is&#xD;
Rabbi David de Lara. On either aide of&#xD;
him, lost in contemplation are the Rabbis,&#xD;
Isaac Aboab* and Mose Abudiente. The&#xD;
first a thin figure, with grandly vaulted&#xD;
brow, and small sharp eyes, the latter a&#xD;
younger man with black curling beard and&#xD;
large dreaming features. Rabbi Mose Ra&#xD;
phael do Aguilar, a proud figure, and one of&#xD;
Portugal's wisest and highest nobles, who&#xD;
left castles and domains, and bright honors&#xD;
behind, walked up and down before them,&#xD;
reciting prayers ia the voice of the mind&#xD;
and heart. His lips move; but no sound&#xD;
Is heard I Rabbi Israel Pereira and Franko&#xD;
Lerrano, are glancing forward upon the&#xD;
ocean, and Enrique de Costa is standing&#xD;
smith Levi de Barrios and Joseph do Vega&#xD;
looking back, back upon the rock bound&#xD;
shores of Portugal. The calm noonday sky&#xD;
smiles down on them, and only the whirr of&#xD;
swelling sails breaks upon the silence of ex-&#xD;
haustion and awe.&#xD;
There is but one child on this vessel, a&#xD;
boy of about ten years, who had by' his&#xD;
sweet prayers won Pater Domingo's con-&#xD;
sent to share his father's dungeon, who had&#xD;
been liberated with him, and was on the&#xD;
-esel, which bore his parents to Holland.&#xD;

&#xD;
with beaming smile beckons the tired boy&#xD;
He runs to him, and in spite of horrified&#xD;
looks, the young man lifts the boy to hits&#xD;
breast and kisses him. He speaks to him.&#xD;
"You are tired and weary?"&#xD;
"Yes, senor, very much j" the boy re-&#xD;
plies.&#xD;
"But you ought not to tire of praying."&#xD;
"It is true; my father, says so;" replied&#xD;
the boy. "But I should like--?&#xD;
"What? speak what you think "&#xD;
Father says, God is every where. Now&#xD;
I should like better to pray to God when he&#xD;
is in the sky or sea, than when he is in the&#xD;
prayer book. Would not you, senor?"&#xD;
The young man smiled and said:&#xD;
"Perhaps. But, to the God in the human&#xD;
heart, more yet. There boyI your father&#xD;
approaches. He beckons to you."&#xD;
" He is angry because I talked on the day&#xD;
of atonement. Good bye."&#xD;
The boy leaped from the young man's&#xD;
lap, and returned to his father, a man of&#xD;
powerful frame and striking features. They&#xD;
sat down on the other side of the vessel.-&#xD;
Who was the boy? Who was the young&#xD;

Like lightning the news flies through the&#xD;
vessel, and chills the hearts of all. It seem.&#xD;
ed as if with a simultaneous electric shock,!&#xD;
the fatal sight had drawn every eye to it,&#xD;
rather than that one had whispered it to the&#xD;
other, from the captain down. The cry arose,&#xD;
from the mast head:&#xD;
"Sails, in sight!"&#xD;
The :captain reconnoitered through his&#xD;
telescope. Every one crowded around him,&#xD;
breathless with anxiety.&#xD;
"Vessels from the King's navy;, they&#xD;
hang out every rag of sail, in our pursuit,"&#xD;
announced Captain Sporaso.&#xD;
"Adonai Elohim help us!" cried the ter-&#xD;
rifled multitude.&#xD;
"1To prayer! it is time," proclaimed the&#xD;
sonorous voice of Aaron Rodow, who, heed'&#xD;
less of circumstances, attended only to his&#xD;
duties.&#xD;
And from terror and anxiety, from the&#xD;
waves of fear that surged around, that holy&#xD;
-call snatched them, snatched them  away&#xD;
from consciousness of danger, and brought&#xD;
them to God, the God, to whom they, this&#xD;
day, atoned for their sins. The pursuing&#xD;
ahips, the angry Inquisition, thQ. sorrow and&#xD;
trouble of earthly life were as wiped away&#xD;
from each mind by that call to the service&#xD;
of God.*&#xD;
The prayer, the song recommenced. The&#xD;
forms were bent, the white woollen prayer&#xD;
scarfs, with long fringes, drawn over each&#xD;
head, and the young, the fair, together with&#xD;
the aged and deformed, all clad in ghostly&#xD;
shrouds, rocked and swayed to and fro, in&#xD;
the intensity and passion of prayer.&#xD;
And the murmuring sea, accompanied&#xD;
the hymns and the psalmody. The mighty&#xD;
organ of the ocean woke its sweet sounds&#xD;
and rich tunes, to waft those prayers aloft.&#xD;
And through the air of cerulean blue,&#xD;
above the tangled silver cloudlets, the&#xD;
hymns and sounds rose, beyond the golden&#xD;
sun and the stars, and fiery comets, beyond&#xD;
*Perhaps some will opine that this is over-&#xD;
drawn. Such know not the deep piety of the&#xD;
Portuguese Israelites. Neither do they know&#xD;
the entire devotion with which a nation, long&#xD;
deprived of divine service, celebrates it, and&#xD;
the firm trust they repose upon it.&#xD;
&#xD;
the walls of space and time, beyond the&#xD;
boundaries of thought, to the grand mys-&#xD;
terious Source of all.&#xD;
Behold I REAsoN has limits that admit of&#xD;
no overstepping.  The elevations of the&#xD;
.EART are unconfined. Its regions are lint-&#xD;
itless even to visiting the Mystery of God.&#xD;
'Che heart is more powerful than reason.&#xD;
Te philosophy of the heart grander than&#xD;
that of mind.&#xD;
Captain Sporaso, however, was less en-&#xD;
thusiastic concerning these religious ser-&#xD;
vices, and the Dutch sailors of his vessel&#xD;
cared nothing at all about it, since they&#xD;
were for the greater part Protestants. So&#xD;
this brave captain gave orders and h's men&#xD;
set all sails that would draw. Thus the&#xD;
ship proceeded at a very good rate through&#xD;
the water. In fact she sped like- a hawk,&#xD;
but the three royal ships pursued her like&#xD;
eagles.&#xD;
If you had been there, you immediately&#xD;
would have seen that the Israelites could not&#xD;
escape the Inquisition, and that in so many&#xD;
hours the royal hips must come up with&#xD;
Sporaso's vessel, and the small schooner at&#xD;
its side, since their rate of sailing was much&#xD;
more rapid. You would also have seen that&#xD;
the pursuers did not exert themselves very&#xD;
much, while the other vessels were doing&#xD;
their utmost and crowded on sail by sail, to&#xD;
catch each breath of wind.&#xD;
The wind blew steadily and briskly from&#xD;
the South East.&#xD;
, Sporaso's vessel endeavored to go N. N&#xD;
W., and, therefore, was almost driven before&#xD;
the wind. The others in pursuit having&#xD;
the same direction, had also the same advan-&#xD;
tage of the breeze.&#xD;
"They will reach us by the time night&#xD;
comes, said Sporaso.  Escape by flight is&#xD;
impossible."&#xD;
The boatswain Joseppo proposed:&#xD;
"Let us approach the shore. We may&#xD;
cautiously venture into shallow water where&#xD;
they can not follow. At night we may, per.,&#xD;
haps, escape under cover of the darkness."&#xD;
"A good thought indeed," cried the cap-&#xD;
tain; "Joseppo you have won a new jacket&#xD;
by tis advice."&#xD;
"Thanks, senor," replied the gratified boat-&#xD;
swain.&#xD;

Oa, PLOTS AND COUNTERPLOTS.      169&#xD;
&#xD;
The captain called his lieutenant.&#xD;
" Vai Utlopp, it is not possible to escape&#xD;
from these vessels, by holding on our pres-&#xD;
ent course."&#xD;
"Nein, Mynheer."&#xD;
"Do you know of any plan to elude their&#xD;
pursuit."&#xD;
"Nein, Mynheer."&#xD;
"Then, listen. Along the shore for seve-&#xD;
ral miles above Cape Caroveiro stretches a&#xD;
range of sandbanks and breakers out into&#xD;
the sea."&#xD;
e "Yah, Mynheer."&#xD;
" If we make way for it they'll think to&#xD;
have us sure. The breakers in front, they,&#xD;
behind. We shall be lost then in reality."&#xD;
"Nein, Mynheer."&#xD;
"Why not, Van Utlbpp?"&#xD;
"Why not, Mynheer ?"&#xD;
"Aye, why not?   There is a road for a&#xD;
ship right through the breakers and sand-&#xD;
banks. Do you mean that?"&#xD;
" Yah, Yah, Mynheer."&#xD;
"At thisI was hinting. But do you know&#xD;
that it is the most difficult thing in the world&#xD;
to prevent a ship perishing there. The way&#xD;
runs around and between the most hideous&#xD;
rooks, crooked, bending, turning at many&#xD;
points. Who will pilot us-through this ? I&#xD;
have some knowledge of the strait, but far&#xD;
too little to attempt pilotage there. Yet thii&#xD;
isour only chance of escape. Who will pilot&#xD;
us ?&#xD;
" Ha, ha, ha, very good.  A  fine joke,&#xD;
Mynheer."&#xD;
' "A joke? Alas, not. What mean you,&#xD;
Van Utlopp ?"&#xD;
" Why I will pilot you through it, yab,&#xD;
yah, Mynheer."&#xD;
The captain, in excess of joy, almost em-&#xD;
braced his fat Dutch lieutenant.&#xD;
" You can do it ?" he cried.&#xD;
"Yah, Yah, I can, Mynheer."&#xD;
Sporaso knew that upon each of the lieu-&#xD;
t6nant'swords implicit trust might be set, as&#xD;
-regardedsea matters. He hesitatedno more.&#xD;
The vessels approached the coast. The&#xD;
smaller one immediately ran for a shallow&#xD;
basin opening in the shore, whence the royal&#xD;
ships on account of their heavy draught&#xD;
could not follow. But Sporaso's vessel, turn-&#xD;
&#xD;
ed in a slightly northerly direction, and&#xD;
bore immediately down upon the breAers.&#xD;
There they extended, far out into the sea, a&#xD;
long line of hissing foam kind angry waves.&#xD;
They seemed a sno  patch upon the darker&#xD;
surface of the sea.&#xD;
A continuation of jagged, movie or les&#xD;
prominent rocks, interspersed with high&#xD;
heaped sandbanks, and deep whirlpool pits,&#xD;
formed this bar, so dangerous to the unskil-&#xD;
ful mariner. The vessel was bearing right,&#xD;
down on these breakers to the evident anx-&#xD;
iety of all on board. The captain, howev-&#xD;
er, knew this was the only chance of escape&#xD;
from their pursuers, and also knew the ea-&#xD;
quisite skill of his lieutenant.&#xD;
Van Utlopp had ordered most sails to be&#xD;
taken in, he had put the seamen in readiness&#xD;
duly spirited, and prepared, that his slight-&#xD;
est orders might be executed immediately,&#xD;
and properly. He made them understand,&#xD;
that if the ship failed only once to obey his&#xD;
direction, that if they hesitated but once to&#xD;
execute any duty, however dangerous, the&#xD;
next moment would find them struggling for&#xD;
life amongst the breakers. Thus all was&#xD;
ready for the attempt to sail through the&#xD;
narrow passage, the terrors of which all felt&#xD;
end had heard of, but which none perhaps,&#xD;
except the captain and lieutenant had made.&#xD;
Let the reader impress the circumstances&#xD;
on his mind as I will present them now.&#xD;
The three royal ships were coming down&#xD;
with spread sails on Sporaso's vessel; they&#xD;
had gained very much on the latter through&#xD;
superiority of sailing, as well as by the alter-&#xD;
ed course across their track which it assum-&#xD;
ed. The smaller companion was hidden in the&#xD;
shallow basin extending inland. And the&#xD;
vessel itself was cautiously,slowly but surely&#xD;
approaching the roaring and foaming break-&#xD;
ers ahead. The sun about to set. The wind&#xD;
dying. The prayers of Atonement about to,&#xD;
cease.&#xD;
" There will be a storm, Mynheer t" said&#xD;
the lieutenant.&#xD;
" Aye ; the sun sets in a vivid green sky. I&#xD;
do not like the banks of clouds in the South&#xD;
West. We will probably have a storm from&#xD;
that quarter."&#xD;
"Yah, Mynheer."&#xD;
&#xD;
TIB  LATA'L  9BCItET,;&#xD;
&#xD;
"It must not break loose before we have&#xD;
passed the breakers, else we might be lost,&#xD;
Van Utlopp."&#xD;
' We might, Mynheer."&#xD;
"However, the cats' paws, which already&#xD;
stretch the sails, will be advantageous to&#xD;
drive us through."&#xD;
. We must have them, Mynheer."&#xD;
We have no other wind."&#xD;
"Yah, Yah, Mynheer. Let me go to the&#xD;
rudder." And Van Utlopp, went to steer&#xD;
the vessel through the dangerous pass, for&#xD;
already, within a few cables length the foam&#xD;
boiled, and the ugly rocksgrinned above the&#xD;
sea. Each seaman was at his post. The&#xD;
ship was ready for the encounter. And all&#xD;
this time the Israelites, unconscious of ought&#xD;
else had been praying, singing and worship.&#xD;
ping. Unconscious of their great danger, of&#xD;
the attempt-to escape, of the glory which the&#xD;
setting sun poured over sea and s'ky, and of&#xD;
the hissing breakers threatening ahead, they&#xD;
worshipped, atoned. Now the last procla-&#xD;
mation of the high day rose on the evening&#xD;
air. The proclamation of purified hearts,&#xD;
joyful souls, of beings at peace and in love&#xD;
with their maker, of creatures adoring their&#xD;
God.&#xD;
"Hear, oh Israel, the Lord thy God is&#xD;
One!" cried Aaron Rodow.&#xD;
" Hear, oh Israel, the Lord thy God is&#xD;
One," responded the hoarse voices of the&#xD;
congregation.&#xD;
-" The Lord, he is God !" and seventimes&#xD;
Aaron Rodow proclaimed it, with sevenfold&#xD;
response from the congregation. And as&#xD;
the last  *1&#xD;
"ADONAI Hu EwoHin,"&#xD;
swept over the waves, the half disappeared&#xD;
sun, once more seemed to rise, and a flood&#xD;
of golden light was poured over those earnest&#xD;
men in white shrouds, and those snowy-at-&#xD;
tired ladies, The sky once more lighted up,&#xD;
and the golden gates of heaven seemed to&#xD;
open in the West. A moment after, and&#xD;
darkness extinguished the bright colors on&#xD;
the sea and sky.&#xD;
And over the waves was borne the voice&#xD;
of the cornet, as it sounded the call:&#xD;
"To your tents, oh Israel" &#xD;
The day of Atonement had expired. The&#xD;
prayer ceased, the fast was broken.&#xD;
&#xD;
0CH.APTER XLIX.&#xD;
THROUGH THE FOAMING BREAKERS.&#xD;
A dark nightit was; unusually dark. But&#xD;
the white foam that indicated the hidden&#xD;
rocks, and fringed the more projecting, was&#xD;
plainly visible through the darkness. The&#xD;
ship had entered the passage.&#xD;
The royal vessels lay to. They were sure&#xD;
that the fugitives could not escape during&#xD;
the night. For the land behind, the break-&#xD;
ers before them, and the three vessels with&#xD;
their attentive watches forming an impassa-&#xD;
ble cordon on the side toward the ocean;&#xD;
how could they fly. It was a thing of im-&#xD;
possibility, a good joke to think so-imagin-&#xD;
ed the royal captains. As for the passage&#xD;
through the breakers, not one pilot out of&#xD;
fifty was able to make it, and certainly none&#xD;
would attempt it, at night, and in an ap-&#xD;
proaching storm. It was, therefore, a settled,&#xD;
a sure thing, a absolute fact that Sporaso's&#xD;
vessel and the flying Israelites were corner-&#xD;
ed, were caught as if in a mouse trap.&#xD;
And among the breakers, the vessel dart-&#xD;
ed, like an eager warrior. On each side,&#xD;
curling wreaths of foam stretched in long&#xD;
rows, and wound in tangled lines. Only&#xD;
where the vessel had entered, a dark furrow&#xD;
marked the passage. At the helm, stood&#xD;
Lieutenant Utlopp, the captain at his side.&#xD;
The countenance of the Dutch sailor, but&#xD;
now so insignificant and flat, seemed to rouse&#xD;
and grow intelligent, grow sublime, with the&#xD;
emergency. The dull eyes flashed, the hea-&#xD;
vy mouth assumed a noble expression.-&#xD;
Lieutenant Van Utlopp was a changed be-&#xD;
ing. He seemed lord of the waves, and a&#xD;
champion arisen to combat their fury.&#xD;
" The storm will soon begin," said the&#xD;
captain.&#xD;
"Yah, Mynheer; in an hour."&#xD;
"The breeze is already quite strong."&#xD;
"Yah, Mynheer. Too strong for us."&#xD;
He raised his head a little, and eried in&#xD;
a calm, distinct voice:&#xD;
" Reef the mainsail, reef closely."&#xD;
The order was executed, and the ship's&#xD;
speed immediately abated. Now a comb of&#xD;
jagged cliffiets barred the passage. The&#xD;
vessel bore directly down upon them, and, it&#xD;
seemed as if the next moment would spike&#xD;

it, a wreck,upon the rocky points. Enrique,&#xD;
whose anxiety drove him to the rudder,cried:&#xD;
"We are lost!1 God of Mercy I "&#xD;
"Nein, Mynheer," replied the lieutenant,&#xD;
with his strong arm turning the rudder, and&#xD;
wearing the ship several points round, so&#xD;
that it passed within the shortest possible&#xD;
distance of the rockb, and turned into the&#xD;
curve of the passage.&#xD;
Now they seemed about to be thrown on&#xD;
the breakers,then topush into smooth curling&#xD;
water above sandbanks. Every moment al.&#xD;
terations were made in the course of the ves-&#xD;
sel, toadapt it to the tortuous passage. The&#xD;
lieutenant seemed a giant moving the ship&#xD;
hither and thither, by his short quick com-&#xD;
mands, as if it were a toy of his leisure--&#xD;
The captain stood at his side lost in admira-&#xD;
tion and anxiety.&#xD;
The storm had also. risen. Loud and&#xD;
blustering, furious, it swept over the open&#xD;
sea and rolled huge billows inland, and&#xD;
dashed them to mist upon the rocks and ser-&#xD;
rated shore. The ship could scarcely main-&#xD;
tain herself. There wascontinual danger of&#xD;
her being thrown upon the rocks. The sails&#xD;
were all close reefed. Still, the waves, the&#xD;
wind, might at any moment, strike her for-&#xD;
cibly upon the side, and, with irresistible&#xD;
power sweep her upon the cliffs.&#xD;
However, the end of the passage was near.&#xD;
Through the breakers they-were already.-&#xD;
But, where they emerged, a long rocky point,&#xD;
sharp and foam-fringed stretched far out&#xD;
from the land into the sea. It was, in fact,&#xD;
a sharp, dangerous tongue, which, in the&#xD;
form of an eagle's beak, the convex side turn-&#xD;
ed to the South, formed the upper boundary&#xD;
of the breakers. Around the point of this&#xD;
the vessel must pass, with the storm blowing&#xD;
almost directly into its teeth.&#xD;
It was hard work; but the good ship, un-&#xD;
der command of its lieutenant, managed it&#xD;
well. When they had almost reached the&#xD;
point Van Utlopp commanded:&#xD;
"Be ready to throw out the top sails."&#xD;
Several sailors manned the shrouds.-&#xD;
Scarcely had the point of the cliff been reach-&#xD;
ed, when the vessel was worn, and at the&#xD;
lieutenant's command, the topsails were un-&#xD;

A moment's expectation-a heavy strain-.&#xD;
a bending forward of the vessel -and the&#xD;
point was made, the ship was on the other&#xD;
side. A sharp, short crack, like the explo-&#xD;
sion pf a pistol followed almost immediately.&#xD;
The topsails were torn from the yards, and&#xD;
borne along as rags on the breeze. Had&#xD;
this happened a moment ago, the ship would&#xD;
have been wrecked. But "nein, nein," said&#xD;
the lieutenant. It did not happen.&#xD;
CHAPTER L.&#xD;
THE PRINCE-THE GIPSY-THE PUIIEST&#xD;
King Juan had, immediately upon the fall&#xD;
,of Savelli, appointed the' Cardinal Georgio,&#xD;
Grand Inquisitor. This was done not only&#xD;
without the consent but against the wishes&#xD;
of the Grand Inquisitor of Spain. But the&#xD;
King had the right to act independently in&#xD;
this matter, and he used this right. Cardi-&#xD;
nal Georgio, however, assured his majesty,&#xD;
that the papal consent to his choice should&#xD;
not be wanting. He was, therefore, fully in-&#xD;
stituted in the high office, a few days after&#xD;
his predecessor had been taken to prison.&#xD;
One of Cardinal Georgio's first acts, was&#xD;
to dismiss Pater Domingo from his office, and&#xD;
the next to have him arrested, on charge of&#xD;
liberating the prisoners of the Inquisition.&#xD;
An inquiry into his guilt, was immediately&#xD;
instituted. The King had also certain accu-&#xD;
sations against the priest. Therefore, a se-&#xD;
cond trial was ordered before the Council of&#xD;
State, at which the two Grand Inquisitors&#xD;
were to be present.&#xD;
It is but proper to say that every endeavor&#xD;
short of the rack had been made to induce&#xD;
Pater Domingo to confess where the treas-&#xD;
ures of Israelites were hid. King Juan hop-&#xD;
edthatthesecond trialwould elicit something&#xD;
at least, in regard to this subject.&#xD;
It was the day of the trial. Ere we enter&#xD;
the circular apartment in which the council&#xD;
of State assembled, let us describe a scene&#xD;
that occurred in the prison oPPater Domin-&#xD;
go. The count di Almaveda had received&#xD;
the charge of bringing the priest under a&#xD;
strong guard to the palace. He had arrived&#xD;
unusually early, and was now alone in the&#xD;
low vault with the prisoner.&#xD;
" The result of this trial can be but one,"&#xD;

he remarked, addressing Domingo, in the monkish cowl, and spoke in a voice whose&#xD;
tones of one who entreats; "it is yet time, loud imperial sound rang short and sharp&#xD;

&#xD;
When that new Portuguese congregation&#xD;
in Amsterdam, whose emigration or flight&#xD;
we have described in former chapters, many&#xD;
months after it happened,heard of the death&#xD;
of Don Lionel Dian, there was shedding of&#xD;
tears and groanings of sorrow; there was&#xD;
rending of garments, and mourning on the&#xD;
floor. . And, in the new synagogue, around&#xD;
whose holy ark wreathed almond and olive&#xD;
branches, sweet keepsakes of the Southern&#xD;
home, there arose in one loud universal voice&#xD;
the prayer for the dead. Arose in a strain&#xD;
so sad and sorrowful, arose from every heart&#xD;
and lip, in tones, as choked by tearspud&#xD;
sobs, as if each man was mourning his fath-&#xD;
er. And for long months, the evening breeze&#xD;
bore at every sunset, the sounds of that&#xD;
mournful Kadish, far over the Zuider See.&#xD;
Who knows, but the winds and waves took&#xD;
up the sad strain and bore it across the&#xD;
broad ocean to the grave of the Hebrew&#xD;
Prince.&#xD;
And, in the stilly hours of eve, dark-eyed&#xD;
mothers took their wondering little ones up.&#xD;
on the lap, and told them in a hushed voice&#xD;
of the great Piinee, the Ben David, who had&#xD;
done such mighty deeds, and was loved by&#xD;
the Lord, and told them how he saved the&#xD;
congregation, and was called to God, and&#xD;
slept in the golden land far away. And pas.&#xD;
sionate tears of sorrow rolled down the clear&#xD;
dark complexioned cheeks as they bid their&#xD;
children remember him, and endeavor to be-&#xD;
come like him. And the little ones cried&#xD;
along, and stammered the name of Don Li-&#xD;
onel Dian, the great Ben David, and glorious&#xD;
prince, in holy awe.&#xD;
And as year by year passed away, and on&#xD;
the anniversary of their escape, Aaron Ro.&#xD;
dow chanted joyful Psalms, and the syna.&#xD;
gogue was decorated with orange and almond&#xD;
boughs, hearts rejoiced again and again.--&#xD;
And as on the anniversary of Don Lionel's&#xD;
death, the mournful Kadish was recited&#xD;
again, the heart was wrung and the eye dim-l&#xD;
med at the recollection. And the memory of&#xD;
the Hebrew Prince was kept fresh and green.&#xD;

Happily it carried them northward, and eve.&#xD;

the sea, brought them nearer their destina-&#xD;
tion. Morning dawned; the storm subsid-&#xD;
ed; the sea grew calm; and the ship with&#xD;
widespreadsails ploughed her course through&#xD;
the plunging billows. On the second day&#xD;
she was rejoined by her companion, the&#xD;
smaller vessel, which had also managed to&#xD;
escape, during the storm. Many anxious&#xD;
fears were relieved by this re-union.&#xD;
Not long after, anchor was east in the&#xD;
Zuider See, and the Portuguese Israelites&#xD;
were landed in Amsterdam. We need. not&#xD;
say how glad they were to find their children&#xD;
and treasures there. A congregation was&#xD;
immediately formed, which still exists at the&#xD;
present day. Happiness and success smiled&#xD;
upon them, they grew wealthy and honored,&#xD;
and enjoyed, in peace, the liberty of eon-&#xD;
science and divine worship they had sought&#xD;
for. Holland became their new home, the&#xD;
country of their children. They prospered&#xD;
in it, they liked it. Butstill longing glances&#xD;
were thrown to the south, and fond desires&#xD;
yearned for the brilliant life in sunny Por-&#xD;
tugal. Portugal their own first home, the&#xD;
land they loved for its own sake, for their&#xD;
own sakes; Portugal was a name that woke&#xD;
the music in their breasts, the tear in their&#xD;
eye. Around Portugal, memory wove her&#xD;
sweetest thoughts, and memory is often the&#xD;
paradise of life. Oh, and nevermore did&#xD;
they behold it, nevermore dwelled their eye&#xD;
on the broad Tagus, and on haughty Gintra,&#xD;
and on the golden steepled Lisbon. In their&#xD;
dreams, on the sunset sky, and deep in the&#xD;
canals of Amsterdam only, they, saw the&#xD;
bright shadows of the past home and the past&#xD;
happiness.&#xD;

could be proved, he was soon again set -st&#xD;

Great were the rejoicings that evening, for&#xD;
the captain had been in South America, and&#xD;
on his return touched in Portugal, and stay.&#xD;
ed there several weeks. Inquiries were the&#xD;
order of the day now. Inquiries after old&#xD;
friends, old places, old things, everything he&#xD;
could mention, was of interest. Each of the&#xD;
company seemed to live his youth over again.&#xD;
Even Donna Bananda began to talk and re-&#xD;
late of the time when the noblest of the land&#xD;
sang ditties beneath her windows, and how,&#xD;
when in Spain with Princess Bianca, the&#xD;
Duke de Medina Sidonia and the Duke de&#xD;
Ildefonso were rivals for her affections.&#xD;
Not long, and the table was set at Good&#xD;
frow Rosa's order. The supper was brought&#xD;
in on heavy silver vessels. Old fiery Span-&#xD;
ish wines were taken from the cellars, and&#xD;
golden Southern fruits from the greenhouse.&#xD;
Songs and anecdotes of days long past, bril-&#xD;
liant reminiseenses and court scandal, spark-&#xD;
ling wit, and rich humor, were the subjects&#xD;
of the conversation. All lived again the hap-&#xD;
piest part of their lives. Any one listening&#xD;
would have been sure that those present&#xD;
were of the highest nobility of Spain and&#xD;
Portugal. Even their children looked at&#xD;
them with strange astonishment. Thus pas-&#xD;
sed the evening. And many such evenings&#xD;
were kept in the Dutch mansion, each one&#xD;
serving to keep Portugal's memory bright.&#xD;
We turn to the second scene. On the&#xD;
coast of India, one of the Portuguese forts&#xD;
has been attacked and taken by the natives.&#xD;
As well known the Portuguese were in al-&#xD;
most constant warfare with the inhabitants&#xD;
of India. It was at the time when the hate&#xD;
of the East Indians inflamed by the treach-&#xD;
erous Venitians, had embittered them most&#xD;
&#xD;
JOUNTERPLOTS.                       175&#xD;
against the new colonists.  The fort we&#xD;
speak of was peculiarly obnoxious from the&#xD;
wild cruelty and oppression of its governor.&#xD;
Therefore, the rajah of the neighboring&#xD;
mountains with his warriors had descended&#xD;
into the plain\and taken the fort. The Por-&#xD;
tuguese had resisted well, but been forced&#xD;
to yield to numbers. The Indians slaugh-&#xD;
tered them mercilessly. But the governor&#xD;
and his beautiful young wife were brought&#xD;
prisoners to the rajah. He looked at them&#xD;
sternly.&#xD;
"Let me be ransomed," said the governor,&#xD;
who was no other than Don Miguel di Sousa.&#xD;
"I offer you great ransom for my life. The&#xD;
King of Portugal will pay it, rajah."&#xD;
"So you love life?" inquired the Indian&#xD;
prince.&#xD;
" What a question? 1 am your prisoner,&#xD;
of war, rajah, and, in honor you are bound&#xD;
to let me be ransomed. Send to the next&#xD;
Portuguese port with your conditions of my&#xD;
release."&#xD;
" The rules of your dishonest nation bind&#xD;
me not. We have other honor than the -&#xD;
Portuguese.-&#xD;
"Rajah, if You harm me, a terrible retri-&#xD;
bution will follow. Fear the power of Por-&#xD;
tugall"&#xD;
"I fear it not. Let this guilty man receive&#xD;
one hundred- stripes, cut his arins and*go&#xD;
off, ad then burn his body. ButeA)that&#xD;
he remain alive as long as possible."&#xD;
Amid his frantic cries, Don Miguel was&#xD;
removed from the Rajah's presence; before&#xD;
sunset the sentence was executed. The ash-&#xD;
es of his body, together with the cut-off limbs&#xD;
were cast in a dung hole.&#xD;
And his wife? His wife, the widow of&#xD;
Don Isidore di Canaroo, the beautiful Donna&#xD;
Miranda, was sent by the rajah, as a present&#xD;
to the Sultan of Hindostan. She elevated&#xD;
herself, soon afterwards, to the position of&#xD;
Sultana, and remained his majesty'sbeloved&#xD;
favorite, as long as he lived. When he died&#xD;
she ruled by her son, the young sultan, and&#xD;
always proved herself a decided enemy of"&#xD;
the Portuguese.&#xD;
I have none else to report of . The future&#xD;
lives of the smaller characters are too unim-&#xD;
portant to record.  Therefore, we totally&#xD;
