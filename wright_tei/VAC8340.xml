CHAPTER .&#xD;
The town-clock was on the last stroke of&#xD;
twelve, the solitary candle measured but two&#xD;
inches from its socket, and, as the summer&#xD;
wind rushed through the half-closed shutters,&#xD;
the melted tallow dripped slowly into the&#xD;
bri htly-burnished brazen candlestick. The&#xD;
, flicTering light fell upon grim battalions of'&#xD;
figures marshalled on the long blue-lined&#xD;
pages of a ledger, and flashed fitfully on the&#xD;
face of the accountant as he bent over his&#xD;
work. In these'latter days of physical degen-&#xD;
eration, such athletic frames as his are rarely&#xD;
seen among the youth of our land. Sixteen&#xD;
years growth had given him unusual height&#xD;
and rema$kable breadth of chest, and' it was&#xD;
difficult to alize that the stature of manhood,&#xD;
had been a gained by a mere boyin years.. A&#xD;
gray suit (evidently home-made),'of rather&#xD;
coarse texture, bespoke poverty ; .and,/owing'&#xD;
to the oppressive heat of the atmosphere, the'&#xD;
-coat was thrown partially off.. He wore no&#xD;
vest, and the loosely-tied black ribbon suf-&#xD;
fered the snowy white collar-to fall away from&#xD;
the throat and expose its w'ell-turned outline.&#xD;
The head was large, but faultlessly proportion-&#xD;
ed, and the thick .black  air, cut short and&#xD;
clinging to the' temples, added to its massive-&#xD;
ness. The lofty forehead, white and smooth;&#xD;
the somewhat heavy brows, matching the hue&#xD;
of the hair ; the straight, finely-formed nose,&#xD;
with its delicate but clearly-defined nostril,&#xD;
and full firm lips, unshaded by mustache, com-&#xD;
bined to render the face one of uncommon'&#xD;
beauty. Yet, asJie sat absorbed byhis figures,&#xD;
there was nothing' prepossessing or winning in&#xD;
his appearance; for though you could not carp&#xD;
at the moulding of his features, you involun-&#xD;
tarily shrank-from theprematurely grave, nay,&#xD;
austere expression which seemed habitual to&#xD;
them.' Hie looked just what he was-youthful'&#xD;
in months and years, but old in trials, sorrows,&#xD;
and labors; and to one who analyzed his coun-&#xD;
tenance, the conviction was inevitablethathis&#xD;
will was gigantic, his ambition unbounded, his&#xD;
intellect wonderfully acute and powerful. It&#xD;
is always sad to remark in young faces the ab-&#xD;
Sence of that bearning enthusiasm wliich only&#xD;
a joyous heart iniparts, and though in this-in-&#xD;
stanoe there was nothing dark or sinister; fou&#xD;
&#xD;
MAC ARI A.&#xD;
&#xD;
could-not fail to be awed by the cold, dauntless&#xD;
resolution which said so plainly, "I struggle,&#xD;
and shall conquer. I shall mount, though the&#xD;
world defy me."  Although , he had dlored&#xD;
since dawn, there was no- drooping othe&#xD;
muscular'frame, no symptom of fatigue, save&#xD;
in the absolute colorlessness of his face.. Firm&#xD;
as some brazen mnument'on its pedestal. he&#xD;
sat and worked on, one hand wiel~ing the pen,&#xD;
the other holding down the leaves which flut-&#xD;
tered, now and then, as the breeze passed&#xD;
over them.&#xD;
" Russell, do you knowiit is midnight.?"&#xD;
He frowned, and answered.without looking&#xD;
up.a&#xD;
"Yes.&#xD;
" How much longer will you sit up ?"&#xD;
" Till I finish my work."&#xD;
The speaker stood on the threshold, leaning&#xD;
against the door-facing, and, after waiting a&#xD;
few moments, softly crossed 'the room and put&#xD;
her hand on the back of his chair.- She was&#xD;
two years his junior, and though evidently the&#xD;
victim -of recent and severe illness, even in&#xD;
her feebleness she was singularly like hin.&#xD;
Her presence seemed to annoy him, for he&#xD;
turned round and said hmetily '&#xD;
"Electra, go to bed.' I told you-good-night&#xD;
three hours ago."&#xD;
She stood still, but silent.&#xD;
" What do you want ?"&#xD;
" Nothing."&#xD;
He wrote on for some ten; minutes Ionger,&#xD;
then closed the ledger and put it aside. The '&#xD;
handle had burned low; he took:a fresh one&#xD;
from the drawer of the table! acid, after light-&#xD;
ing it, drew a Latin dictionary '0ai to'him,&#xD;
opened a worn copy of Hor ce, andbegan to&#xD;
study. Quiet as his own shadow -stood the,&#xD;
fragile girl behind hia chair, but as 'she *atch-&#xD;
ed %im a heavy sigh esoapd her. Once more&#xD;
he looked ip with a linger still in the 'diction-&#xD;
ary, and, asked impatientlf'&#xD;
"Why on earth don't 'you go to sleep?"&#xD;
can' gleep ;I have tried my bestA'&#xD;
my 0*lttlecosn?&#xD;
"Are y sick a ainmyfoP6htliedts   "&#xD;
He stretched out his arm and drew herlose&#xD;
to him.&#xD;
"No'; but I"kno* you are up, hard i  ork,:&#xD;
and it keeps me a*ak . If you *lpold onl&#xD;
let me help you.'                'i&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC8340-00000004"/>&#xD;
-- V  -S                                    -                a&#xD;
&#xD;
6&#xD;
" But you can't help me ; I have told you&#xD;
so time and again.You only interrupt and&#xD;
hinder me."&#xD;
She colored, and bit her lip ; then answered,&#xD;
- sorrowfully :&#xD;
"If I thought I should be weak and sickly&#xD;
all, my life, I would ,rather die at once and&#xD;
burden you and Auntie no longer."&#xD;
" Electra, who told you that you burdened&#xD;
 me ?",'&#xD;
," Oh, Russell! don't I know how hard you&#xD;
have to work ; and how difficult it is for you&#xD;
to get even- bread and clothes. Don't I see&#xD;
how Auntie labors day after day, and month&#xD;
after month ?  You are good and kind, but&#xD;
does that prevent my feeling the truth, that&#xD;
you are working for me too?  If I could only&#xD;
help you in some way." She knelt down by&#xD;
his chair and leaned her head on his knee,&#xD;
holding his hands between both hers.&#xD;
"Electra, you do help me; all day long&#xD;
when I am at the store your face ,haunts me,&#xD;
strengthens me;y I feel that I am striving to&#xD;
give you comforts, and when at night you&#xD;
meet me at the gate, I am repaid for all I&#xD;
have done. You must put this idea out of&#xD;
your head, little one ; it is 'altogether a mis-&#xD;
take. Do ru hear what I say ? Get up and&#xD;
go to sleep like a good child, or you will have&#xD;
another wretched headache to-morrow, and&#xD;
can'tbring me my lunch."&#xD;
He lifted her from the floor and kissed her&#xD;
hastily. She raised her arms as if- to wind&#xD;
them about his neck, but his grave face gave&#xD;
her no eneoura ement ; and turning away she&#xD;
retired to her room, with hot tears rolling over&#xD;
her cheeks. Russell had scarcely read half a&#xD;
dozen lines after his cousin's departure when&#xD;
a soft hand swept back the locks of hair on&#xD;
his forehead and wiped away the heavy drops&#xD;
- that moistened im. ,x..&#xD;
"Â«My son, you promised me you would not&#xD;
sit up late to-night."&#xD;
" Well, Mother, I have almost finished. Re-&#xD;
member the nights are very short now, and&#xD;
twelve o'clock comes early."&#xD;
4' The better reason that you should not be&#xD;
- up so late. My son, I am afraid you will ruin&#xD;
your health by this unremitting application."&#xD;
"1Why-look at me. I am as strong as an&#xD;
Athlete of old." He shook his limbs and smiled,&#xD;
proud of his great physical strength.&#xD;
"Â«True, Russell; but, robust as you are, you&#xD;
*can not stand~ such toil without detriment.&#xD;
Put up your books."&#xD;
ot yet; I have more laid out, and you&#xD;
1us&#xD;
know I invariably finish all I set apart'to do.&#xD;
But, Mothier, your hand is hot ; you are not&#xD;
we."se the thin hand and pressed it to&#xD;
his lips.&#xD;
"A mere headache, nothing more. Mr.&#xD;
Clark was here 'to-day; be is very impatient&#xD;
. about the rent; I told him we were doing all&#xD;
we could, arnd thought that by September we&#xD;
&#xD;
should' be able t the whole. He spoke&#xD;
of going to see youbich I urges him not,&#xD;
to do, as'you were eering yourself to the&#xD;
utmost." '&#xD;
Slie scanned his face while she spoke, and&#xD;
noted the compression 9( his mouth. He knew&#xD;
she watched him, and waiwered:with a forced&#xD;
smile:&#xD;
" Yes, he came to the store this morning. I&#xD;
told himwe 'ad been very unfortunate this&#xD;
year in losi g our only 'servant; and that.&#xD;
sickness had {orded us to incur more expense&#xD;
than usual.   ever, I drew fifty dollars and&#xD;
paid him all I could. True,'I anticipated my&#xD;
dues, but Mr. Watson gave me permission.&#xD;
So for the present you need not worry about&#xD;
rent."&#xD;
" What is the amount of that grocery-bill&#xD;
you igould not let me see last week ?"&#xD;
." My dear mother, do not trouble yourself&#xD;
with these little matters; the grocery-bill will&#xD;
very soon be paid. I have arranged with Mr.&#xD;
Hill to keep his books at night, and, therefore,&#xD;
you may be easy. Trust all to me, Mother ;&#xD;
only take care of your dear self, and I ask no&#xD;
more."&#xD;
"Oh, Russell! my son, my son !"&#xD;
She had drawn a chair near him, and now&#xD;
laid her head on his shoulder, while tears&#xD;
dropped on his hand. He had not seen her&#xD;
so unnerved for years; and as he looked down&#xD;
on her grief-stained, yet - resignd face, his&#xD;
countenance underwent a marvelous change ;&#xD;
and, folding his arms about her, he kissed her&#xD;
pale, thin cheek repeatedly.&#xD;
"Mother, it is not like you to repine in this&#xD;
way; you who have suffered and endured so&#xD;
much must not despond, when, after a long,&#xD;
starless night, the day begins to dawn."&#xD;
"I fear 'it dawns in clouds and heralds only.&#xD;
storms.'- For myself I care not, but for you,&#xD;
Russell-my pride, my' only hope, my brave&#xD;
bo,y lit is for you that I suffer. I have been&#xD;
thinking to-night that this is a doomed place&#xD;
for you, and th't if we could only save money&#xD;
enough to go to California, you might take&#xD;
the position you merit;' for there-none would&#xD;

He lifted his mother's head from his bosom&#xD;
and rose, with a haughty, defiant smile on his&#xD;
lip.&#xD;

" Hush, Russell; you must subdue young fierce&#xD;

was this ungovernable rage which brought dis-,&#xD;
grace upon your young, innocent head._ Oh !&#xD;
it grieves me, my son, to see how bitter you&#xD;

His voice faltered an instant, and he put his&#xD;
arms tenderly round the drooping form.&#xD;
" We have troubles enough, my son,- with-,&#xD;

There was a brief pause, and Russell Au-&#xD;
brey passed his hand over his ejes and dashed&#xD;
oil a tear. H~is mother watched him, and&#xD;
said cautiously: .&#xD;
&#xD;
,7&#xD;
&#xD;
" Have you noticed that my eyes are rapid-&#xD;
ly growing worse ?"&#xD;
"Yes,   other ; I have been. anxious for&#xD;
some weeks."&#xD;
" You know\it all, then ?"&#xD;
" Yes, Mother."&#xD;
"I shall not murmur; I have become re-&#xD;
signed at last; though for many weeks I have&#xD;
wrestled for strength, for patience. ' It was so&#xD;
exceedingly bitter.to know that the time drew&#xD;
near when I'should see you no more; to feel&#xD;
that I should stretch out my hands to you, and&#xD;
lean on you, and yet look no longer on the&#xD;
dear face of my child, my boy, my ally But&#xD;
my prayers were heard;,the sting has passed&#xD;
away, and I am resigned.' I am'g ad we have&#xD;
spoken of it; now my mind is calmer, and I&#xD;
can sleep. Good-night, my son."&#xD;
She pressed the customary good-night kiss&#xD;
on his lips, and left hiin. He closed the die'&#xD;
tionary,- leaned his elbow on -the table, and&#xD;
rested his head on his' hand. His piercing&#xD;
black eyes-were fixed gloomily on the floor,&#xD;
and now and then his broad chest heaved as&#xD;
dark and painful thoughts crowded up.&#xD;
Mrs. Aubrey was the only daughter of&#xD;
wealthy and ambitious parents,'who refused&#xD;
to sanction her marriage with the object of&#xD;
her choice, and hreatened to disinherit her&#xD;
if she persisted in' er obstinate course. Mr.&#xD;
Aubrey was poor,     onest, highly cultivat-&#xD;
ed, and, in every sense of that much-abussd&#xD;
word, a gentleman. His poverty was nOt ,to&#xD;
be forgiven, however, and when the daughter&#xD;
left her father's roof, and wedded the man&#xD;
whom her parents detested, the die was cast ;&#xD;
she was banished for ever from a home of af-&#xD;
fluence, and found that she a indeed'forfeit-&#xD;
ed her fortune. For this sh  as prepared,&#xD;
and- bore it bravely; but ere 'long severer&#xD;
trials came upon . her.  Unfortunately,' her&#xD;
husband's temper was fierce and ungoverna=&#xD;
ble ; and pecuniary embarrassments rarely&#xD;
have the effect of sweetening such. He re-&#xD;
moved to an inland town and .embarked in&#xD;
mercantile pursuits; but, misfortune followed&#xD;
him, and reverses came thick and fast. One&#xD;
miserable day, when from early morning every-&#xD;
thing had gone wrong, an importunate predi-&#xD;
tor, of-wealth and great influence in the com-&#xD;
munity, chafed at Mr. Aubrey's tardiness in&#xD;
repaying some trifling.sum, proceeded to taunt&#xD;
and insult-him most unwisely. .Stung to mad-&#xD;
ness, the wretched man resented the insults;-&#xD;
a struggle ensued, and tt its;close Mr. Aubrey&#xD;
stood over the corpse of the creditor. - There&#xD;
was no mode gf escape, and the arm: of the&#xD;
law consigned h im to prison. During the te-&#xD;
dious weeks that elapsed before the; trial, his&#xD;
devoted wife, strove to cheer and eiledurage&#xD;
him~ by every effort which one human being&#xD;
can make for another.~ Russell was- about&#xD;
eleven years of age, and, boy 'though he was,&#xD;
realized .most fully the horrors of his parent's&#xD;

&#xD;
situation. The days of the trial came at last;&#xD;
but he had surrendered himself to 'the demon&#xD;
Rage---had taken the life of a fellow-creature;&#xD;
what 'could legal skill accomplish ? The affair&#xD;
produced great and continued excitement;&#xD;
the, murdered man had been exceedingly pop-&#xD;
ular, and the sympathies of the citizens were&#xD;
enlisted in behalf of his family. Although&#xD;
clearly a case of manslaughter only, the vio-&#xD;
lent prejudice of thecommunity and the ex-&#xD;
ertions of, influential. friends so' biassed the&#xD;
jury that, to the astonishment of the counsel&#xD;
on both sides, the cry- of " blood . for blood "&#xD;
went out from that crowded court-room, and,&#xD;
in defiance of precedent, Mr. Aubrey was un-&#xD;
justly sentenced to be hung. When the ver-&#xD;
dict was known Russell placed his insensible&#xD;
mother on a couch, from which it seemed prob-&#xD;
able she would never rise. But there is an&#xD;
astonishing amount of endurance in even a&#xD;
feeble-woman's frame, and after a time she&#xD;
went about' her. house once more, doing her&#xD;
duty to her child and learning to "suffer and&#xD;
grow' strong." Fate had ordained, however,&#xD;
that Russell's father should not die upon the&#xD;
gallows; and soon after the verdict was pro-&#xD;
nounced, when all Mrs. Aubrey's efforts to&#xD;
procure a pardon had proved unavailing, the&#xD;
proud and desperate manl, in the solitude of&#xD;
his cell, with no eye but Jehovah's .to-witness&#xD;
the awful deed, the consummatioig of his woes,&#xD;
took his own life-with' the aid of a lancet&#xD;
lautched his guilty, soul into eternity. On&#xD;
the 'floor of the cell was found a blurred sheet,&#xD;
sprinkled with -blood, directed to his wife, bid-&#xD;
ding her farewell, and committing her and her&#xD;
boy to.the care of'an outraged andinsulted&#xD;
God. Such was the legacy of shame which&#xD;
Russell inherited; was it any marvel that at&#xD;
sixteen that boy had lived ages of sorrow ?&#xD;
Mrs. Aubrey found her husband's financial&#xD;
affairs so involved that she relinquished the&#xD;
hope of retaining the little she possessed, and&#xD;
retired to a small cottage on the outskirts of&#xD;
the town, where she endeavored to support&#xD;
herself and the two dependent on her by tak-&#xD;
ing in sewing.&#xD;
Electra Grey was the orphan child of Mr.&#xD;
Aubrey's only sister, who dying in poverty be-&#xD;
queathed the infant to her brother. He had&#xD;
loved her as well as his own.Russell; and his&#xD;
wife, who cradled her, in her arms and taught&#xD;
her to walk' by clinging to her finger, would&#xD;
almost as soon have parted with her son as the&#xD;
little Electra. For five' years the widow had&#xD;
toiled by midnight-lamps .to feed these two;&#xD;
now oppressed nature rebelled, the long over-&#xD;
taxed eyes refused to perform their office;&#xD;
filmy cataracts stole over them, veiling their-&#xD;
'adness and their unshed tears-blindness was.&#xD;
creeping- on. At his father's death Russel&#xD;
was forced to quit school, and with ,some 'diffi-&#xD;
culty he succeeded in obtain' situation in&#xD;
large dry- ods tore, where hi labors were'-&#xD;
onerous intm extreme and his wages a mere .&#xD;
&#xD;
pittance. To domineer over those whom ad-&#xD;
verse fortune places under their control is by&#xD;
no means uncommon among ignorant and sel-.&#xD;
fish men, whose industry has acquired inde-&#xD;
pendence, and though Russell's,employer, Mr.&#xD;
Watson, shrank. from  committing a gross&#xD;
wrong, and prided himself on his scrupulous&#xD;
honesty, still 'his narrow mind and penurious&#xD;
habits strangled every generous impulse, and,&#xD;
without 'being absolutely cruel -or unprinci-&#xD;
pled, he contrived ,to gall the boy's proud&#xD;
spirit and render his position one of almost&#xD;
purgatorial severity.p'    .        '&#xD;
The machinery of human will is occult and&#xD;
complicated; very few rigidly analyze .their&#xD;
actions and discern tle motives that impel&#xD;
them, and if 'any one had told Jacob Watson&#xD;
that Envy was the secret spring which prompt-&#xD;
ed his unfriendly course toward his young&#xD;
clerk he would probably have indignantly de-&#xD;
nied the accusation. The blessing of an edu-&#xD;
cation had been withheld .from him; he grew&#xD;
up. illiterate, and devoid of refinement ; fort-&#xD;
une favored him,-he amassed wealth, and de-&#xD;
termined that his children should enjoy every&#xD;
advantage which money could command. His&#xD;
eldest son was just Russell's age, had been&#xD;
'sent to various schools from his infancy, was&#xD;
indolent, self-indulgent, and thoroughly dissi-&#xD;
pated. Having been a second time expelled&#xD;
from school for most disgraceful misdemeanors,&#xD;
he lounged away his time about the store, or&#xD;
passed it still more disreputably with reckless&#xD;
companions.&#xD;
The daily contrast presented by Cecil and&#xD;
Russell irritated the father, and.hence his set-&#xD;
tled dislike of the latter. The faithful dis-&#xD;
charge of duty on the part of the clerk afford-&#xD;
ed no plausibleoccasion for invective ; he felt&#xD;
that he was narrowly watched, and. resolved&#xD;
to give no ground for fault-finding; yet dur-&#xD;
ing the long-summer days, when the intense&#xD;
heat prevented customers from thronging the&#xD;
store, and there was nothing to be done, when&#xD;
Russell, knowing that the books were written&#xD;
up, and the counters free from goods, took his&#xD;
Latin grammar and improved every leisure&#xD;
half-hour,:he was not ignorant of the fact that&#xD;
an angry scowl darkened his employer's visage,&#xD;
and understood whyhe was constantly inter-&#xD;
rupted to perform most unnecessary labors.&#xD;
But in the same proportion that obstacles&#xD;
thickened his energy and resolution doubled ;.&#xD;
and herein one human soul differs from anoth-&#xD;
er, in strength of will which furnishes powers&#xD;
of endurance. What'the day denied he, re-&#xD;
'claimed from night, and succeeded in acquir-&#xD;

reading 'several' Latin books. .Findin that.&#xD;
his small salary was inadequate, now that his&#xD;
mother's failing sight prevented her from ac-&#xD;
complishing the' usual amount of sewing, he&#xD;
solicited and obtained 'permission to'- keep an&#xD;

burn nor brown, but between gold and bronze ;."&#xD;
and as the sun shone on it the rippling waves&#xD;
flashed until their burnished glory seemed. a&#xD;
very aureola.. It was thick and curling; she&#xD;
wore it parted on her pale, polished forehead,&#xD;
and it hung around her like a gilded veil.&#xD;
The face was an oval; you might measntre it&#xD;
by all the rules of art and no imperfection&#xD;
could be found, unless the height of the brow&#xD;
were considered out of proportion. The nose&#xD;
was delicate and clearly cut, and in outline&#xD;
r sembled that in the antique medals of Olym-&#xD;
pias, the wife of Philip of -Macedonia. The&#xD;
upper lip was short, and curved like aow ;&#xD;
the lower, bin, firm, and straight. Her eyes&#xD;
were strangely, marvellously beautiful; they&#xD;
werelarger than usual, and of that'rare shade&#xD;
of purplish blue which borders the white&#xD;
velvet petals of a clematis. When the eyes&#xD;
were uplifted, as on this occasion, long curling&#xD;
lashes of the bronze hue of her hair rested&#xD;
against her brow. Save the scarlet lines&#xD;
which marked her lips, her face was of 'that&#xD;
clear colorlessness which can be likened only&#xD;
to the purest ivory. Though there was an&#xD;
utter absence of the rosy hue of' health, the&#xD;
transparency of the complexion seemed char-&#xD;
acteristic of her type, and precluded all&#xD;
thought of disease. People are powerfully at-&#xD;
tracted by beauty, either of form, color, or a&#xD;
combination of both; .and it frequently hap-&#xD;
pens that something of pain mingles with the&#xD;
sensation of pleasure thus - excited. Now,&#xD;
whether it be that this arises from a vague ap-&#xD;
prehension engendered by the evanescentnat-&#xD;
ure of all sublunary things, or from the ina'&#xD;
bility of- earthly types to satisfy the divine&#xD;
ideal which' the soul enshrines, I shall not&#xD;
here attempt to decide ; but those who exam-&#xD;
ined Irene's countenance were fully conscious&#xD;
of this complex emotion, and strangers who&#xD;
passed her n the street felt intuitively that a .&#xD;
noble, unsullied soul looked out at them from&#xD;
the deep, calm, thoughtful eyes. Miss Marga-&#xD;
ret muttered something inaudible in reply to&#xD;
her last remark, and Irene walked on to&#xD;
school. Her father's residence was about a&#xD;
mile from the town, but the winding road ren-&#xD;
dered the walk'somewhat longer ; and on one&#xD;
side of this road stood the small house occupied&#xD;
by Mrs. Aubrey. As Irene approached it she&#xD;
saw 'Electra Grey coming from the opposite&#xD;
direction, and at the cottage-gate they met.&#xD;
Both paused ; Irene held out her hand cordi-&#xD;
ally-              -.&#xD;
"Good-morning. I have not seen you for a&#xD;
fortnight. . 1 thought you weretoming to school&#xD;
again as soon as you were 'strong enough ?"&#xD;
"No; I am not going back to school."&#xD;
"Why?"              '          - .&#xD;
" Because Auntie can't aff'ord- to send me '&#xD;
any longer. You know her eyes are growing&#xD;
worse'every day, and she is not able to take&#xD;
in sewing as she used to do. I am sorry.; but&#xD;
11it Can't be helpeth"&#xD;
&#xD;
" How do, you know it can't be helped ?&#xD;
Russell told me he thought she had cataracts&#xD;
on her eyes, and they can be removed."&#xD;
" Perhaps so, if we had the means of con-&#xD;
sulting that celebrated physician in New Or-&#xD;
leans. Money removes 'a great many things,&#xD;
Irie, but unfortunately we have n't it."&#xD;
" The trip would not cost much; suppose&#xD;
you speak to'Russell aboutit."  -&#xD;
" Much or little, it will require more than&#xD;
we can possibly spare.t Everything is so high&#xD;
we can barely live as it is. But I must go in,&#xD;
my aunt is waiting for me."g&#xD;
" Where have you - been so early, Electra ?&#xD;
I hype you will not think me impertinent in&#xD;
asking such a question."&#xD;
"I carried tais waiter full of bouquets to&#xD;
Mr. Carter's. There is to be a grand dinner-&#xD;
party there to-day, and Auntie promised as&#xD;
many flowers as she could furnish. However,&#xD;
bouquets pay poorly. Irie, wait one minute;&#xD;
I lave a little border of mignonette all my&#xD;
ows, and I should like to give you a spray."&#xD;
She hurried into the garden, and retur-ing&#xD;
*ith a few delicate sprigs, fastened one in her&#xD;
friend's belt and.the remainder in the ribbon&#xD;
on her hat.'&#xD;
" Thank you, Electra; -who told you that I&#xD;
love mignonette so well ?  It will not do for&#xD;
you to 'tay away from school; I miss you in&#xD;
my class, and, besides, you are losing too much&#xD;
time. Something should be done, Electra.&#xD;
Good-by."I&#xD;
They shook hands, and Irene walked'on..&#xD;
" Something should be done," she repeated,&#xD;
looking down fixedly yet vacantly at the sandy&#xD;
road. Soon- the brick walls of the Academy&#xD;
rose grini and uninviting, and taking her place&#xD;
at the desk she applied herself to her books.&#xD;
When school was dismissed in the afternoon,&#xD;
instead of retuping home as usual, she walked&#xD;
down the principal street, entered Mr. Wat-&#xD;
son's store, and put her books on the counter."&#xD;
It happened that the proprietor.stood near the&#xD;
front-door, and he came forward instantly to&#xD;
wait upon her.       .    .&#xD;
"Ab, Miss Irene ! happy to see you.. What&#xD;
shall I have the pleasure of showing you ?"&#xD;
"Russell Aubrey, if you please."&#xD;
The merchant stared, and she added:&#xD;
"I want some kid gauntlets, but Russell&#xD;
can get them for me."&#xD;
The   oung clerk stood at the desk in the&#xD;
rear of the store, with his back toward the&#xD;
counter; and Mr. Watson called out':-&#xD;
" Here, Aubrey, some ki&amp;amp;gauntlets for this&#xD;
young lady."&#xD;
ie laid down his pen, and taking a box of&#xD;
gloves from the shelves placed it on the count-&#xD;
er before her. Hes had not noticed her par-&#xD;
ticularly, and when she pushed back her hat&#xD;
and looked up at him'he started slightly.&#xD;
" Good-evening, Miss Huntingdon. What&#xD;
number do you wish'?' ,&#xD;
Perhaps it was from the heat of the day, or .&#xD;
&#xD;
from stooping over his desk,,or perhaps it was&#xD;
from something else, but his cheek was flushed,&#xD;
and gradually it grew pale again.&#xD;
" Russell, I want to speak to you about&#xD;
Electra. She ought to be at school, you&#xD;
know."&#xD;
," Yes." '&#xD;
" But she saysyour mother can't aford the&#xD;
expense."                          II&#xD;
"Just now she can not; next year things&#xD;
will be better."&#xD;
'"What is the tuition for her ?"&#xD;
",Five dollars a month."&#xD;
" Is that all ?'I&#xD;
He selected a delicate fawn-colored pair of&#xD;
gloves and laid them before her, while a faint&#xD;
smile passed over his face.&#xD;
" Russell, has anything happened ?"&#xD;
" What do you mean ?"&#xD;
" What is troubling you so ?"&#xD;
Nothing more than usual. Do those gloves'&#xD;
suit you ?"&#xD;
" Yes, they will fit me, I believe." She'look-&#xD;
ed atf him very intently.  '&#xD;
He met her gaze steadily, and for an instant&#xD;
his face brightened ; then, she said abruptly:&#xD;
"Your mother's eyes are worse ?"  .&#xD;
"Yes, much worse."&#xD;
"Have you consulted Dr. Arnold about&#xD;
them ?"&#xD;
"-He'says he can do nothing for her."&#xD;
" How much would it cost 'to take her to&#xD;
New Orleans and have that celebrated oculist&#xD;
examine them ?".&#xD;
"More than we can afford just now.; at&#xD;
least two hundred dollars."-&#xD;
" Oh, Russell! that is not much. Would&#xD;
not Mr. Watson lend you that little ?"&#xD;
" I shall hot ask him."&#xD;
" Not even to restore your mother's sight ?"&#xD;
"Not to buy my own life. Besides, the ex-&#xD;
periment is a doubtful one."&#xD;
S" Still it is worth making."' .&#xD;
" Yes, under different circumstances it cer-&#xD;
tainly would be."&#xD;
" Have you talked to Mr. Campbell about&#xD;
it?'   -&#xD;
" No, because it is useless to discuss the mat-&#xD;
ter."    -&#xD;
" It would be dangerous to go to New Or-&#xD;
leans now, I suppose ?"&#xD;
"October or Novemberwould- be better."&#xD;
Again she looked at him very earnestly, then&#xD;
stretched out her little hand.&#xD;
" Good-by, Russell; 1 wish 1, could do some-&#xD;
thiug to help you, to make you less sorrowful."&#xD;
He held the slight waxen fingers, and his-&#xD;
mouth trembled as he answered:&#xD;
"Thank you, Miss Huntingdon. I am not&#xD;
sorrowful, but my path in'life is .apt quite so&#xD;
flowery as yours."&#xD;
"1I wish you would not call 'me ' Miss Hun-&#xD;
tingdon,' inthat stiff, far-off way, as if we were&#xD;
not friends. Or maybe it is a hirit that you&#xD;
desire me to address you as Mr. Aubrey. It&#xD;
&#xD;
sounds-strange, unnatural, to say anything but&#xD;
Russell."&#xD;
She gathered up her books, took the gloves,&#xD;
and west slowly homeward, and .Russell re-&#xD;
turned -to.his '4esk with a light it.his eyes&#xD;
which, for the remainder of the day, nothing&#xD;
could quench. As Ireneascended the long&#xD;
hill on which Mr. Huntingdon's residence stood&#xD;
she saw her father's buggy at the door, and as&#xD;
she approached the .steps he came out, draw-&#xD;
ing on his gloves.&#xD;
" You are lte, Irene. What kept you?"&#xD;
"I have been shopping a little.. Are you&#xD;
going to ride? 4ake me with you."&#xD;
" Going to din at Mr. Carter's."&#xD;
" Why, the su is almost down now. What&#xD;
time will you ce home ? I want to ask you&#xD;
something."&#xD;
"Not till long after you are asleep."&#xD;
He took his seat in the byggy, and the&#xD;
spirited horse dashed down the avenue.  A&#xD;
servant came forward to take her hat and&#xD;
satchel and inform her that her dinner'had&#xD;
waited some time. Miss Margaret sat croch-&#xD;
eting at the front-window of the dining-room,&#xD;
and Irene ate her dinner in silence. As she&#xD;
rose and-approached her aunt the door swung&#xD;
open 'anda youth entered, apparently about&#xD;
Russell's age, though really one year older.&#xD;
"Irene, I am tir d to death waiting for you.&#xD;
What a provoking girl you are'! Tbe horses&#xD;
have been saddled at least one hour and a half.&#xD;
Do get on your riding'dress. ' I am out of all&#xD;
patience."&#xD;
He rapped his boot heavily with his whip&#xD;
by way of emphasis, and looked hurriedly at&#xD;
his watch.&#xD;
"i did not promise to ride. with you this&#xD;
evening, Hu'h,' answered his cousin, seating&#xD;
herself on ie. window-sill and running her&#xD;
fingers lightly over the bars of a beautiful cage,=&#xD;
where her canary pecked playfully at the fair&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
" Oh, nonsense ! Suppose you did n't prom-&#xD;
ise ; I waited for you, and told Grace Harriss&#xD;
and Charlie that we would meet them at the&#xD;
upper bend of the river, just above the Factory.&#xD;
Charlie's new horse has just arrived from Ver-&#xD;
mont--Green Mountain Boy he calls him-&#xD;
and. we have a bet of a.half-dozen pairs'of&#xD;
gloves that he can't beat my Eclipse. -Do come&#xD;
along I. Aunt Margaret, make her come."&#xD;
"I should like to see anybody make, her.do&#xD;
what she is not in the hunior for," said his aunt,&#xD;
looking over her glasses at the lithe, graceful&#xD;
figure on the window-sill.&#xD;
"flu'h, I would rather stay at home,,for I&#xD;
am tired, but I will go to oblige you."&#xD;
Miss' Margaret lifted tier eyebrows, and as&#xD;
his cousin left the room Hugh Seymour ex-&#xD;
claimed:&#xD;
-"Is n't she the greatest beauty in the Uniled&#xD;
States ?"&#xD;
" She will 1e a h~elle when she is grown.;&#xD;

lacks her gayety of disposition. s'She is full of&#xD;
strange notions, Hugh,; you don't know thb&#xD;
half of her character-he'own father does not.&#xD;
Frequently I am puzzled to understand her&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
"Oh l she will come out of all that. She is&#xD;
curious about some things now, but she will&#xD;
outgrow it."'&#xD;
I am afraid she will not, for it is as nuch&#xD;
a part of her as the color of her hair or the&#xD;
shape of her nose. She has always been queer."&#xD;
Iiene appeared at the door with a'small sil-&#xD;
ver pore-monnaie in her hand. She counted&#xD;
the contents, put .it into her pocket, and,&#xD;
gathering up the folds of her habit, led 'the&#xD;
way to the front door. Hugh adjusted the&#xD;
reits, and laying one hand on his she sprang&#xD;
lightly to her saddle, then stroked 'her horse's&#xD;
silky, mane and said:&#xD;
" Erebus can leave Green Mountain Boy so.&#xD;
far behind that Charlie would find it no easy&#xD;
matter to count the plumes in my hat. Are&#xD;
you ready ?"&#xD;
The beautiful jetty creature, as if conscious&#xD;
of her praise, tossed his head and sprang off&#xD;
in a canter, but, wheeling round, she called to&#xD;
the groom who stood watching them:&#xD;
"Unchain Paragon I"              "&#xD;
Five minutes later the cousins were gallop&#xD;
ing on, with a superb greyhound following&#xD;
close at fErebus' heels, and leaping up now&#xD;
and' then in obedience to the motion of Irene's&#xD;
hand.' The road ran through a hilly country,&#xD;
now clad in stern ancestral pines, and now&#xD;
skirted with oak and hickory, and about a mile&#xD;
beyond the town it made 'a sharp angle and&#xD;
took the river bank. The sun had set, but&#xD;
the western sky was still aglow; and near the&#xD;
bank, where the current was not perceptible,&#xD;
the changing tints df the clouds were clearly&#xD;
mirrored, but in the' middle of the stream a&#xD;
ledge of rock impeded its course and the wa-&#xD;
ter broke over with a dull roar, churning itself&#xD;
into foam and spray as it dashed from shelf 'to&#xD;
shelf of the stony barrier. Just opposite he&#xD;
Fall Irene checked her here and paused to'&#xD;
admire the beauty of the scene; but in another&#xD;
moment- the quick tramp of hoofs fell on her&#xD;
ear, and Ungh's youngifriends joined them.&#xD;
Green Mountain Boy was flecked with foam,&#xD;
and as Irene measured his perfections at one&#xD;
hasty glance, she, patted her favorite's head&#xD;
and ohallenged'Charlie for a trial of speed.,&#xD;
"'No; Charlie and I must have' the race.&#xD;
Miss Grace, you and Irene can take cafe 'of&#xD;
yourselves for a few minutes. We *ill wait for&#xD;
you on the ,edge of town, ,at the' graveyard.&#xD;
Now, Charlie, I am ready."&#xD;
They took there places in front, and were'&#xD;
soon out of sight, as the rdad followed the&#xD;
curved of the river. 'Erebus plunged violently&#xD;
at first, not being accustomed to' lag /behind&#xD;
el~lipse, buts by much persuasion apd frequent&#xD;
.kind touches on his head, Irene thanaged to&#xD;
reconcile hima to the temporary disgrace.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Grace looked at his antics rather fearfully,&#xD;
an observed that no amount of money could&#xD;
tempt her to mount him.&#xD;
" Why iot ?"&#xD;
" He will break your neck yet."&#xD;
" He is very spirited, but as gentle as Para-&#xD;
gon. a Come, Grace, it is getting late ; they&#xD;
will be waiting for us. Quicken your sober,&#xD;
meek little brownie."&#xD;
'"So Electra is not coming' back to school,&#xD;
It is a greatity'she can't have an educa-&#xD;
tion."'&#xD;
"Who told you anything about her ?"&#xD;
"Oh,.everybody knows how poor her aunt&#xD;
is,; and now, to mend matters, she is going&#xD;
blind. I would go to see Electra occasionally&#xD;
if the family had not been so disgraced. .I&#xD;
like her,' but no genteel person recognizes&#xD;
Mrs. Aubrey, even in the street."&#xD;
" That is very unjust. She is- one of the&#xD;
most refined, elegant women I have ever seen.&#xD;
She ought not to be blamed for her husband's&#xD;
misfortune. Poverty is no crime."&#xD;
- If she had been treated to a Hindostanee&#xD;
proverb Grace could not have looked more&#xD;
stupidly surprised.-&#xD;
-." Why,. Irene I Mrs. Aubrey wears a bit-&#xD;
calico to church.".&#xD;
" Well, suppose she does? Is people's worth&#xD;
to be determined only by the cost or the quality&#xD;
of their clothes ? If I were to give your cook&#xD;
a silk dress exactly like that one your uncle&#xD;
sent you from' Paris, and provide her with&#xD;
shawllind bonnet to match, would she be your&#xD;
equal, do you think ? I imagine you would&#xD;
not thank me or anybody else who insinuated&#xD;
that Mrs. Harriss' negro cook was quite' as'&#xD;
genteel and elegant aS Miss Grace herself, be-&#xD;
cause she'wore exactly the same kind of clothes.&#xD;
I tell you, Grace, it is all humbug 1 this ever-&#xD;
lasting talk about fashion, and dress, and gen-&#xD;
tility I PshaW I I amjick of it., When our&#xD;
forefathers were fighting for freedom, for a&#xD;
national existence, I wonder whether their&#xD;
wives measured each other's respectability or&#xD;
gentility by their lace collars or the number of&#xD;
flounces on their dresses? Grace Harriss, your&#xD;
great-grandmother, and mine, and probably&#xD;
everybody's else, spun the cotton, and wove&#xD;
the cloth, and cut and made their homespun&#xD;
dresses, and were thankful to get them. ,And&#xD;
these women'" who kad not even bit-calicoes&#xD;
were the mothers, and wives and sisters and&#xD;
daughters of men who established the most'&#xD;
glorious government on the face of the broad&#xD;
earth"  The way thewomen of America have&#xD;
degenerated is a crying shame. I tell you, I&#xD;
would blush to look my great-grandmother ii&#xD;
tho face."m&#xD;
Grace shrugged her shoulders in expressive&#xD;
silence, and, Soon after, they reached the spot&#xD;
wheu'e thie boys were 4aiting to join them. ,&#xD;
"E6lipsenade god his name I" cried Hugh, ,&#xD;
triumphantly, while Charlie bit his lip with&#xD;
chagrin.&#xD;
&#xD;
MACARI4.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Never mind, Charlie; Erebus can distance&#xD;
Eclipse any day."&#xD;
"No soeasily," muttered'Hugh.&#xD;
"I will prove it the next time we ride. Now&#xD;
for a canter as far as Grace's door."&#xD;
On they went, through the main street of&#xD;
the town: Erebus ahead, Paragon at his heels,&#xD;
then all the others. The wind blew Irene's veil&#xD;
over her eyes, she endeavored to put it back,&#xD;
and inthe effort dropped her whip. It was&#xD;
dusk; they were near one of the crossings, and.&#xD;
a tall, well-known form stooped, found the&#xD;
whip, and handed it up, Erebus shied, but&#xD;
the hand touched Irene a as it inserted the sil-&#xD;
ver handle in ,the slender fingers.&#xD;
" Thank you, Russell; thank you very much."&#xD;
- He bowed fprmally drew his straw hat over,&#xD;
his brow, and walked on with two heavy ac-&#xD;
count-books under his arm.-.&#xD;
"I can't endure that boy," said Hugh, at_&#xD;
the distance of half a square, flourishing his&#xD;
whip energetically as he spoke.&#xD;
"Nor I," chimed in Charlie.&#xD;
" Whynot? I have known him a long time,&#xD;
and I like him very much."&#xD;
".He is so confoundedly proud and saintly."&#xD;
" That exists entirely in your imagination,&#xD;
Hugh. You don't know half his good quali-&#xD;
ties,"~returned Irene, a little quickly.&#xD;
" Bah !-" began her cousin; but here their&#xD;
companions bade them good-night,.and,as if&#xD;
disinclined to continue the.subject, Irene kept&#xD;
in advance till they reached home. Tea was&#xD;
waiting; Miss Margaret and Hugh 'talked of&#xD;
various things ; Irene sat silent, balancing her&#xD;
spoon on the edge of her-cup. Finally, tired&#xD;
of listening, she glided tothe front-door and&#xD;
seated herself on the steps. Paragqn followed,&#xD;
and laid down at her feet. Everything was&#xD;
quiet, ave the distant roar of 'the river as it&#xD;
foamed over its rocky bed; below, hanging on&#xD;
the bank of the strearn,'lay the town., Fromni&#xD;
her elevated position she could trace the wind-&#xD;
ing of the ittreets by the long 'rows of lamps,&#xD;
-and now and then a faint hum rose on. the&#xD;
breeze as it swept up the hill and lost itself int&#xD;
the forest behind the house. Very soon HughE&#xD;
came out, cigar in hand, and threw himself'&#xD;
down beside her.&#xD;
"What is the matter, Irie,?"&#xD;
" Nothing."                     . -&#xD;
"What are you moping here for ?"&#xD;
"I am' not moping at all I ani waiting for&#xD;
Father.".                               -&#xD;
" Ie will not be. here for three hours yet. t&#xD;
Don't you know 'that, Mr.. Carter's dinners&#xD;
always end in card-parties ? He is famous I&#xD;
for whist and euchre,' and doubtless his din- i&#xD;
ners pay him welL?" What do you want with&#xD;
." Hugh,' do throw away your cigar It is&#xD;
ridigulous to see a boy of your age puffing away t&#xD;
in that style. Betting and sasoling seemr to&#xD;
be the only things you have learned at T'ale.&#xD;
By the way, when do you go back ?"  '    t&#xD;
&#xD;
18&#xD;
&#xD;
"Are you getting tired of me ? I go back&#xD;
in ten days.' irene, do you know that ,I am not&#xD;
comiiw;home next actionn,' I have remise4&#xD;
a party of merry fellows to spend it w4h them&#xD;
in Canada. TLen the next ummer I go to&#xD;
Europe for two years atleast. .Are jouhieten-&#xD;
ing.? Do you understand that it will be four&#xD;
years before I see you again ?"&#xD;
" Yes, I understand..-,&#xD;
"I dare say the time will seem.long4r to me&#xD;
than to you."&#xD;
"I hope, wheayou do come back, we shall&#xD;
not be disappointed in you."&#xD;
He 'took her. hand, but she withdrew her&#xD;
fingers.&#xD;
"Irene, you belong to me, and you know it."&#xD;
"NIo ! I belon' to God and myself."&#xD;
She rose, anti, retreating to the library,&#xD;
opened her books and began to study. The&#xD;
night passed very slowly; she looked at the&#xD;
clock again and'again. Finally the house be&#xD;
came quiet, and at last the crush of wheels on&#xD;
the gravel-walk announced her fathers return.&#xD;
He came into thelibrary for a cipa , and, with-&#xD;
out ,noticing her, drew his chair 'to th# open&#xD;
window. She approached 'and put her hand&#xD;
on hi shoulder.&#xD;
"Iene! what is the matter, 'child ?"&#xD;
":Nothing, sir ; only.I want to ask you Some-&#xD;
thing.&#xD;
" Well, Queen, what is it ?"&#xD;
He drew her tenderly to his knee and pass-&#xD;
ed his hand over het floating hair.&#xD;
Leonard Huntingdon was forty years old;-&#xD;
tall, spare, with an erect and martial carriage.&#xD;
He had. been trained at West Point, and per'&#xD;
haps early education contributed somewhat to&#xD;
the air of unbending haughtiness which many&#xD;
found repulsive.' His black hair was slightly,&#xD;
sprinkled with gray and his features were still&#xD;
decidedly handsome, though the expression of&#xD;
mouth and eyes was, ordinarily, 'by no means&#xD;
winning. He could seem very fascinating, but&#xD;
rarely deigned to be so; and an intimate ac-&#xD;
quaintance was not necessary to teach peq e&#xD;
that 'hewas eroud, obstinate, and thorough&#xD;
selfish, loving only Hugh, 'Irene, an himself.&#xD;
$he was his only child; her mother had 'die4&#xD;
during her infancy, and on this beautiful idol&#xD;
he lavished all the tenderness of which ,his&#xD;
nature was, capable. His tastes were culti-&#xD;
vated, his house was elegant and complete,&#xD;
and furnished magnificently; every luxury&#xD;
that money could yield' him he 'possessed, yet,&#xD;
there were times when he seemed ,moo4y and&#xD;
cynical, and no one cogld surmise ths  use of&#xD;
his glooi. To-night there was noshaeowton&#xD;

recover her sight.. She has cataracts on her&#xD;
eyes, and there is a physician in New Orleans&#xD;
-    who can relieve her. She is-poor, and it will&#xD;
cost about two hundred dollars. ' Father,'won't&#xD;
you give me thÂ§ money ?"&#xD;
He'tookthe cigar from his lips, shook off the&#xD;
ashes. and asked indifferently:&#xD;
" What is the woiian's name?  Has she no&#xD;
husband to take care of her ?"&#xD;
"Mrs. Aubrey; she-&#xD;
" What!-"&#xD;
The cigar fell from his fingers, he put'her&#xD;
front his knee, and rose instantly. His swarthy&#xD;
cheek glowed, and she wondered at the ex-&#xD;
pression of his eyes, so different from anything&#xD;
she.had ever seen there before.    .&#xD;
"Father,-do you know her ?"&#xD;
" What do you know of her ?  What busi-&#xD;
ness is it of, yours, whether she, goes blind or&#xD;
not ?  Is it possible Margaret allows you to&#xD;
visit at that house ? Answer me, what do you&#xD;
know about her ?"&#xD;
" I know that she is a very gentle, unfort-&#xD;
unate woman; that she has many bitter trials;&#xD;
that she works hard to support her family; that&#xD;
she is noble and-"&#xD;
"Â«Who gave you permission to visi4 that&#xD;
house ?"&#xD;
"Â«No permission was necessary. I go there&#xD;
because I love her and Electra, and-because&#xD;
I like Russell. Why should n't I go there, sir?&#xD;
Is poverty disgrace ?" '&#xD;
-    "Irene, mark me.   You are to visit that&#xD;
house'no more in future ; keep away from the&#xD;
whole family. I will have no such association.&#xD;
Neverlet me hear their namesagain. Go to&#xD;
bed."&#xD;
" Give me one good reason, and I will obey&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" Reason 1 My will, my command, is suffi-&#xD;
cient reason. What do you mean by cate-&#xD;
chising me in this way ? Implicit obedience is,&#xD;
your duty."&#xD;
The calm, holy eyes looked wonderingly into&#xD;
his; and as he marked the startled expression&#xD;
of the 'girl's pure face'his own 'efhs drooped.&#xD;
"Father, has Mrs. Aubrey ever injured&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
No answer.&#xD;
"' If she has'not, you are very'unjust to her ;&#xD;
if she has, remember she is a woman, bowed&#xD;
down with many sorrows, and it is unmanly to&#xD;
hoard up old differences. Father, please give&#xD;
me that money."   . -&#xD;
"I will bury my last-dollar in the Red Sea&#xD;
first!l /Now arb you answered ?"&#xD;
She put ber hand over here 'es, as if to shut&#xD;
out some'painful vision; and 'e saw the slight,&#xD;
fore shudder.' In perfect silence she took her&#xD;
'booh'and went up to herroom. Mr. Hunting-&#xD;
don reseated himself as the door closed behind&#xD;
her, and the lamp-light showed a sinister smile&#xD;
writhin ovr 'his dark. features. In the busy&#xD;
hours o day, in tlpe rush and din of active life,&#xD;
men can drown remorseful whispers and -shut&#xD;
&#xD;
their eyes to the panorama which Memory&#xD;
strives to place before them; but there come&#xD;
still hours, solemn and inexorable, when strug-&#xD;
gles are 'useless and the phantom recollections&#xD;
of early years crowd up like bannered armies.&#xD;
He sat there, stai-ing out into the starry night,&#xD;
and seeing by the shimmer of the setting moon&#xD;
only the graceful form. and lovely face of Amy&#xD;
Aubrey, as She had appeared to him in other&#xD;
days. Could he forget the hour when she&#xD;
wrenched her cold fingers from his 4lasp,,and,&#xD;
in defiance of her father's wishes, vowed she&#xD;
would never be his wife ? No; revenge was&#xD;
sweet, very sweet; his heart had swelled with&#xD;
exultation when the verdict of death upon&#xD;
the gallows was pronounced upon the husband&#xD;
of her choice; and now, i her poverty, her&#xD;
humiliation, her blindness gave him deep, un-&#xD;
utterable joy. This history of the Past was&#xD;
a sealed volume to his daughter, but she was&#xD;
now for the first time conscious that her father&#xD;
regarded the widow and her. son with uncon-&#xD;
querable hatred; and with strange, foreboding&#xD;
dread she looked into the Future, knowing that&#xD;
forgiveness was no part of his nature ; that i -&#xD;
sult or injury was never forgotten.&#xD;
CHAPTER III-&#xD;
Whether the general rule of implicit obe-&#xD;
dience to parental injunction admitted of no&#xD;
exceptions, was a problem which Irene readily&#xD;
solved,; and on Saturday, as soon as her father&#xD;
and cousin had started to the plantation.&#xD;
(twenty-five miles distant), she put on her hat&#xD;
and walkedo town. Wholly absorbed in phi-&#xD;
lanthropic schemes, she hurried along the side-&#xD;
walk, ran up a flight-of steps, and knocked at&#xD;
a door on which was written, in large gilt let-&#xD;
ters, " Dr. Arnold,"   ,.&#xD;
" Ah, Beauty I come in. Sit down, and tell&#xD;
me what brought you to town so early."&#xD;
He was probably a man of fifty; gruff in&#xD;
appearance, and unmistakably a bachelor.'&#xD;
His thick hair was grizzled; -so was the heavy&#xD;
beard; and shag y gray eyebrows slowly un-&#xD;
bent as he'took is visitor's little hands and&#xD;
looked kindly down into her grave face. From&#xD;
her infancy he had petted and fondled her,&#xD;
and' she stood as little in awe of him as of&#xD;
Paragon.-&#xD;
" Doctor, are you busy this morning ?"&#xD;
" I am never too busy to attend to you, little,&#xD;
one. What is it ?"-&#xD;
" Of course you know that Mrs. Aubrey is&#xD;
almost blind."'&#xD;
"Of 'course I do, having been her - phy-&#xD;
sician-"&#xD;
"Those cataracts can be removed, how-&#xD;
ever."&#xD;
"Perhaps they can, and perhaps they can't."&#xD;
"'Mlut the probabilitiess are that a good ocu,.&#xD;
list can relieve her. n '        -       .&#xD;

&#xD;
" 'wo hundred-dollars would-defray all the&#xD;
expenses of a trip to New Orleans for. this&#xD;

-" Decidedly too poor."&#xD;
His gray eyes twinkled promisingly, but he&#xD;
would not anticipate her.&#xD;
"Dr. Arnold, don't you think you could&#xD;
spare that small sum without much incon-&#xD;
venience ?"&#xD;
"16eally! is, that what you trudged into&#xD;
town for ?"A&#xD;
" es, just that, and-nothing else.' If I had&#xD;
had themoney I should not have applied to&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" PshawI your father could buy me a dozen&#xD;
times,"&#xD;
"At any rate, I have not the necessary&#xD;
amount at my disposal just now, and I came to&#xD;
ask you to lend it to me."&#xD;
"For ho4w long, Beauty ?"&#xD;
" Till I am of age-perhaps not so long. I&#xD;
will pay yoti the interest."&#xD;
"You will climb.Popocatapetl, won't you?&#xD;
Hush, child.".--      .-&#xD;
He went into the adjoining room, but soon&#xD;
returned and resumed his seat on the sofa by&#xD;
her side.           a&#xD;
"Irene, did you first apply to your father ? -I&#xD;
don't relish,the idea of being a dernier ressort."&#xD;
" What difference: can it make to you wheth-&#xD;
er I did or did not ?' That I come to you at&#xD;
all is sufficient proof of my faith in" your gen-&#xD;
erosity.""-                        _" .&#xD;
Hiram Arnold was an acute and practised.&#xD;
physiognomist, but the pale, quiet face per-&#xD;
plexed him.&#xD;
"Do you want the money now ?"&#xD;
" Yes, if you please; but before you give it&#xD;
to me I ought to tell you that I want the mat-&#xD;
ter kept secret. No one is to know anything&#xD;
about it-not even my father."&#xD;
"Irene,; is it right to inveigle me into&#xD;
schemes with which you are ashamed to hive&#xD;
your own father'acquainted ?"&#xD;
" You know the whole truth, therefore you&#xD;
Are not inveigled- and moreover, Doctor, I&#xD;
am not ashamed of anything I do.",&#xD;
She looked so unermbarrassed that for a mo-&#xD;
ment he felt puzzled.&#xD;
"I knew Mrs. Aubrey before her marriage."&#xD;
He bent 'forward to watch the effect. of-his&#xD;
words, but if she really -knew or suspected&#xD;
aught yi' the past, there was not the slightest&#xD;
intimation of it. Putting back her hair, she&#xD;
looked up and answered:'&#xD;
" That should increase your willingness to,&#xD;
aid her in her misfortunes."&#xD;
" Hold out your hand: fifty, one hundred, a&#xD;
hundred and fifty, two hundred. There, will'&#xD;
that do ?'&#xD;
*" Thank you! thank you! You will not&#xD;
need it soorn, I hope.?" -&#xD;
"Not until you are ready to pay me."&#xD;
"Dr. Arnold, you have given me a great deal&#xD;
of pleasure---more than I can express. 1--"'&#xD;
&#xD;
" Don't try to express it, Queen. You have&#xD;
given me infinitely more, I assure you."&#xD;
Her splendid eves 'were lifted toward him,&#xD;
and with some sudden impulse she touched her&#xD;
lips to the hang he had placed-on her shoulder.&#xD;
'Something like a tremor crossed the doctor's&#xD;
.habitually -stern month as he looked at the&#xD;
marvellous beauty of the girl's countenance,&#xD;
and he kissed her slender fingers as reverently&#xD;
as though he touched something consecrated.&#xD;
"Irene, shall I take you home in my byg-&#xD;
gy?"&#xD;
" No, thank you,"I would rather walk. Oh !&#xD;
Doctor, I an so much obliged .t9 yon."&#xD;
She drew her hat over her face and went&#xD;
down the "steps. Di'. Arnold walked slowly.&#xD;
across the office-fior ,with his hands behind&#xD;
'him; the grim face ,was placid, now, the dark&#xD;
furrows on his brow were not half sg deep and&#xD;
as he paused and ,closed a ponderous volume&#xD;
lying on the table, a smile suddenly flitted over&#xD;
his features, as one sees a sunbeam stiggle&#xD;
through rifts in low rain-clouds. lH put the&#xD;
book in the case and locked the, glass door.&#xD;
The "Augustinian Theory of Evil" wascon-&#xD;
tained in the volume, which -seemed by "no&#xD;
means to have satisfied him.&#xD;
"All a maze worse than that of Crete I I&#xD;
will follow that girl; she shall be my Ariadne&#xD;
in this Egyptian darkness. Pshaw ! if His&#xD;
.Highness of Hippo were right, what wouilbe-&#xD;

In answer to Irene's knock,.Electra opened&#xD;
the cottage-door- and 'ushered. her into 'the&#xD;
small room which served as both'kitchen' and&#xD;
dining-room. Everything was scrupulously&#xD;
neat, not a spot on 'the bare polished floor;hot&#xD;
a speck todim the purity of the snowy diniity&#xD;

"Miss Irene, Aunt."-  '"   '&#xD;

one of the hands in both hers,.said eagerly:&#xD;
*" You shan't "ffer much longer ; these veils&#xD;

The widow ,had risen hastily and covered&#xD;
her face with her hands, while, an unwonted&#xD;
flush ,dyed her cheeks. She trembled, and&#xD;
Irene saw tears stealing through the fingers.&#xD;
"Mrs. Aubrey, don't you think it is your&#xD;
duty to recover your sight if possible ?"&#xD;
" Yesif I could command the means,"&#xD;
You have the means-you must employ&#xD;

tDon't refuse it, Auntie ; you will wound'&#xD;

With a faltering voice she asked:,&#xD;
"Did youi father send me this money ?"&#xD;

It was the first time she had.ever alluded to&#xD;

linked itself with her, father.. What couldn't&#xD;

then Mrs. Aubrey too' the hands from her face&#xD;
and said: "Irene, I will accept 'your generous&#xD;

Mrs. Aubrey sat with her face in her hands,&#xD;
listening to the mournful, solemn voice that&#xD;
stole up from the mouldering, dusty crypts of&#xD;
by-tone - years'; and ,putting the note in her&#xD;
pocket, Electra leaned her head against the&#xD;
wind w and thanked God for the gif of a true&#xD;
friend. Thinking of the group she had just&#xD;
left, Irene approached the gate and saw that&#xD;
Russell stood olding it open for, her to pass.&#xD;
Looking upshe stopped, for the expression of&#xD;
his face frightened and pained her.,&#xD;
" Russell, what is the matter'? oh ! tell me. '&#xD;
A scornful, defiant smile. distorted his blood-&#xD;
less lips,mbut he made no answer. She took&#xD;
his hand; it was cold, and the fingers were&#xD;
clenched..&#xD;
" Russell, are you ill ?"  ... .&#xD;
She.shuddered at the glare in his black&#xD;
eyes. -&#xD;
" I am not ill."&#xD;
"Won't you tell your friend what ails you ?"&#xD;
" -have no friend but my mother 1"&#xD;
" Oh, Russell, Russell i"&#xD;
Her head drooped, and the glittering hair&#xD;
swept as a veil between them. The low, flute-&#xD;
like, pleading voice stirred his heart, and the&#xD;
blood surged over his pallid forehead.&#xD;
"I have been injured and insulted. Just&#xD;
now I doubt all people and all things, even the&#xD;
justice and mercy df God."&#xD;
" Russell, 'shall not the. righteous Judge of&#xD;
all the earth do right?"'&#xD;
" Shall the rich and the unprincipled eter-&#xD;
nally trample upon the poor and- the unfortu-&#xD;
nate ?"&#xD;
" Who has injured you?"'&#xD;
"A meek-loolimg man, who passes for a&#xD;
Christian, who turns pale at the sound of a&#xD;
violin, who exhorts to missionary labors, and&#xD;
talks often about widpws and orphans, Such&#xD;
a man, knowing the circumstances that sur-&#xD;
round me-my poverty, my mother's affliction-&#xD;
on bare and mest unwarrantable suspicion&#xD;
turns me out of my situation as clerk, and en-&#xD;
deavors to brand my name with infamy. To-&#xD;
day I stand disgraced in the eyes of t4 com-&#xD;
inunity, thanks to the vile slanders of that pil-&#xD;
lar of the church, Jacob Watson. Four hours&#xD;
ago I went to my work quietly, hopefully; but&#xD;
now another spirit has entered and possessed&#xD;
me. Irene, I am desperate. Do you wonder ?&#xD;
It seems to me ages have, rolled over mesince&#xD;
my mother kissed me this mormling; thereis a&#xD;
hissing serpent in my 'heart which I have no&#xD;
power to ezpel. I could bear dt-myself; but&#xD;
my mother! my goble, patient, suffering moth-&#xD;

den to those aIready. crughimg out her life.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pleasant tidings," these I bring her: that her&#xD;
son 'is disgraced, branded as a rogue !"&#xD;
There was no moistlige in the keen eye,ono&#xD;
tremor in the metallic'ring'of his voice, no re-&#xD;
laxation of the curled lip.&#xD;
" Can't you prove your innocence ? WsS it,&#xD;
money ?"&#xD;
"No, it was a watch; my watch, whith'I&#xD;
gave up as security for drawing a portion of&#xD;
my salary in advance. It was' locked up in&#xD;
the iron 'safe ; this morning it w8 missing, and&#xD;
they accuse me of having stolen it."&#xD;
He took off his hat as if it oppressed him,&#xD;
and tossed back his hair. ,&#xD;
" What will you do, Russell ?"&#xD;
"I don't know yet."&#xD;
"OhI if I could only help 'you."&#xD;
She clasped her hands over her heart, and,&#xD;
for the' first time since her infancy tears rush-&#xD;
ed down her cheeks. It was painful to see.&#xD;
that quiet girl' so moved, and Russell hastily&#xD;
took the folded hands in his and bent his face&#xD;
close, to hers.=&#xD;
"Irene, the only comfort I have is that , yoi&#xD;
are my friend. Don't let them infuence you&#xD;
against me. No matter what you may hear,&#xD;
believe in me.' Oh, Irene, Irene ! believe in'&#xD;
me always I"              . .&#xD;
He held her hands in a clasp so tight that it1&#xD;
pained her, then suddenly dropped them and&#xD;
left her. As a pantomime all this passed be-I&#xD;
fore Electra's.eyes; hot 'a word reached her,.&#xD;
but she knew that something unusual'had oc-&#xD;
curred to bring her cousin home at that hour,&#xD;
and felt that now he was but the avant-cou-&#xD;
rier of a new sorrow. She glanced toward her&#xD;
aunt's bowed form, then smothered a groan,&#xD;
and sat waiting for the blow to -fall 'upon her.&#xD;
Why spring to meet it?  He went to his own'&#xD;
room first, and five, ten, fifteen minutes rolled&#xD;
on. She listened tothe faint sound of his&#xD;
steps, and knew that he paced, up and 'down 1&#xD;
the floor ; five minutes more'of crushing sus-&#xD;
pense, and he came along' the passage and&#xD;
stood at the door. She looked at him, pale,&#xD;
erect, and firm, and shuddered in thinking of&#xD;
the struggle which that calm exterior had cost '&#xD;
him. Mrs.' Aubrey recognized the- step, and&#xD;
looked round in surprise.'&#xD;
"Electra, I certainly hear Russell'comin;."s&#xD;
He drew near and touched her cheek with 't&#xD;
his lips, saying tenderly:               s&#xD;
"'How is' my mother ?"s&#xD;
" Russell, what brings'you home so early ?" t&#xD;
"That is rather a cold welcome, Mother, t&#xD;
but I am not astonished. Can you benr 'to&#xD;
hear soniething.unpleasant ? Here, putyour o&#xD;
hands in mine ; now listen to me.' You know  a&#xD;
I drew fifty dollars-of mysalary in advance, to $l&#xD;

'nearly a thousand dollars The end of, it all&#xD;

A 1w, plaintive&amp;amp;'y escaped the    ds&#xD;

he missed her while faced conatrei   t&#xD;

drank a glass of water.&#xD;
s"And now, Russell, sit down and let me&#xD;

There' is still a bright spot left to look upon."&#xD;
Stealing her hand 'into 'his, the mother in-&#xD;
formed him of all that 'had occurred during&#xD;
Irne's visit, and concluded by laying the&#xD;
money in his palm.&#xD;
Electra sat opposite,.watching the change&#xD;
that came over the face she loved best on&#xD;
earth. Her large,' eager, midnight eyes noted&#xD;
the 4uick flush and 'glad light which over-&#xD;
spread his features; 'the deep joy that kindled&#xD;
in his toistred 'soul; and unconsciously she&#xD;
clutched her fin ers till the .nails grew. purple,&#xD;
as' though sttivn uto strange le some hideous&#xD;
object th rusting itself before her. Her breath-&#xD;
ini became labored and painful, her gaze&#xD;
more concentrated and ,searchis g, and when&#xD;
her'ousin 'exclaimed, "Oh, Mother i she is&#xD;
anangel! I have always known it. She is&#xD;
unlke everybody else ." .lectra's heart seemed&#xD;
tostand still; and from that moment a som-&#xD;
bre curtain fell between the girl's eyes and&#xD;
God'ssunshine. She rose, and a silent yet&#xD;
terrible struggle took placein' her passionate&#xD;
soul. Justice and Jealousy wrestled briefly;&#xD;
she would be just, though every star 'fell.froin&#xD;
Iimr sky, and with'a quick, uncertain step she&#xD;
reached Uussell, thrust Irene's note into his&#xD;
fin ersand fled into solitude.&#xD;
'n hour later Russell knocked at the door&#xD;
of an office, which bore on a square tin plate&#xD;
these words, "Robert Campbell, Attorney-at-&#xD;
Law." The door was only partially closed&#xD;
and as he entered an-elderly man looked up&#xD;
from a desk covered with 'loose papers and&#xD;
open volumes, from which he was evidently&#xD;
making extracts. The thin hair hung over, hi&#xD;
fore ead as'if restless fingers had ploughed&#xD;
releal thro gh it, and  as he -kept on&#xD;
er on a half-copied    aragraph, the col&#xD;
gey said very plainly, "This is a busy&#xD;
time with mea despatch your errand at once.&#xD;
" Good-morn in , Mr. Carpbell; are. yot&#xD;

"' flow-d'y-do, Aubrey. I "am generally en&#xD;

He put bis pen behind his ear, crossed his&#xD;
arms on the desk, and looked expectant.&#xD;
"I came here to ask whether you wished to&#xD;
employ any one in your office."&#xD;
" And what. the deuce do you suppose I&#xD;
want with an,office-lad like yourself ? To put&#xD;
the very books I need at the. bottom of a pile&#xD;
tall as theTower of Babel,., and tear up my&#xD;

No, thank you, Aubrey'; I tried that experi-&#xD;
ment to my perfect satisfaction a few months&#xD;
ago. - Is that' all ?"&#xD;
" That is all, sir."&#xD;
The boy rose, but the bitter look that cross-&#xD;
ed his face as he glanced at the well-filled&#xD;
book-shelves arrested the lawyer's attention,&#xD;
and he added:.-&#xD;
" Why did you leave Watson, young man?&#xD;
It is a bad plan to change about in this style."&#xD;
"I was expelled from my situation on a foul&#xD;
and most unjust accusation. I am seeking&#xD;
employmentfron necessity."&#xD;
"Expelled is a. dark word, Aubrey; it will&#xD;
hardly act as a passport to future situations.&#xD;
Expelled clerks are not in demand.",&#xD;
" Still, I'must state the truth unreservedly."&#xD;
" Let 's hear the whole business ; sit down."&#xD;
Without hesitation"'he narrated all the cir-&#xD;
cumstances, once or twice pausing to still the&#xD;
tempest of passion that flashed from his, eyes.&#xD;
While he spoke Mr. Campbell's keen eyes&#xD;
searched hi from head to foot, and at the&#xD;
conclusion heasked sharply :&#xD;
" Â« Where-is the watch, do you suppose ?"&#xD;
" Heaven only knows. I have a suspicion,'&#xD;
*but no right to utter it, since I might thereby&#xD;
inflict a wrong equal to that from which I now&#xD;
suffer."&#xD;
"It is a datk piece of business as it stands."&#xD;
" Yes, but time will clear it up."&#xD;
" See here, Aubrey; I have noticed youtwo,&#xD;

study law. This is my plan,and tor two years&#xD;
I have been pursuing my Latin and. Greek&#xD;

n " I see.Fate has thumped none of your; origt&#xD;

~s I shut my eyes to the watch transaction, and&#xD;

&#xD;
"If so, I shall do my duty faithfully. But&#xD;
you said you did not need any one here, and&#xD;
though I am anxious to -find work I do not ex-&#xD;
peet orgdesire to be taken in from charity. I.&#xD;
intend to'. earn my wages, sir, and from your&#xD;
own account .1 should jdge you had very little&#xD;
use. for an assistant."&#xD;
" Humph,! a bountiful share of pride along&#xD;
with prodigious, obbtimacy. ' Though I am a&#xD;
lawyer, I told you the truth; I have no earthly&#xD;
use for such assistants as I have been plagued.&#xD;
with for several years. In the ngain, office-&#xD;
boys are-a nuisance, comparable only to the&#xD;
locusts. of Egypt; I washed my hands of the&#xD;
whole tribe months since. Now I have.a ne-&#xD;
gro to attend to my office, make fires, etc., and&#xD;
if I could only get an intelligent, ambitious,&#xD;
honorable, trustworthy young man, he would&#xD;
be a help to me. I had despaired of finding&#xD;
such, but, on: the whole, I rather like you;&#xD;
believe you cansuit me exactly if you will,&#xD;
and I am disposed to give you a trial. Sit&#xD;
down here and copy this paragraph; let me&#xD;
see what sort of hieroglyphics I shall have to&#xD;
decipher if I make you my copyist."&#xD;
Russell silently complied, and after.  a care-&#xD;
ful examination it seemed the chirography&#xD;
was satisfactory.&#xD;
" Look there, Aubrey, does that array fright-&#xD;
en you ?"&#xD;
He pointed to the opposite side of the room,&#xD;
where legal documents of every shape and size&#xD;
were piled knee-deep for several yards.&#xD;
"They look formidable, sir, .but nothing&#xD;
would afford me more pleasure than to fathom&#xD;
their mysteries."&#xD;
" And what security can you give me that&#xD;
the instant my back is turned you will not i&#xD;
quit my work and go off, to my books yonder,'&#xD;
-which I notice you have been eyingvery&#xD;
greedily."&#xD;
"No security, sir, but the promise of ,.an&#xD;
honest soul to do its work faithfully and un-&#xD;
tiringly. Mr. Campbell,'I-understand my po-c&#xD;
sition thoroughly; .1 know only too well;that I&#xD;
have everything to make-an 'honorable name,&#xD;

on myself, I expect to help myself. -f. you 1&#xD;

tancy in employing ume  L have concealed 1&#xD;
nothing; you're acquainted with all, the facts, f&#xD;
and must decide accordingly."            s&#xD;
There was nothing pleading in his tone or I&#xD;
mien, but a proud, desperate calmness unu-.&#xD;
sual in one of his age. aWhen a truly honest,s&#xD;
noble soul meets an equal, barriers of position i&#xD;

People called Mr. ,Campbell miserly,"&#xD;
"egotistic," and "selfish." - These are harsh&#xD;
adjectives, and, the public frequently applies&#xD;
them with 'culpable haste and uncllaritable-&#xD;

human nature' to detract, to carp, to spy out,&#xD;
and magnify faults. If at allprone to gxer&#xD;

given any large amount to any particular,&#xD;

CHAPTE R IV.&#xD;
From early childhood Irene had eaperi-&#xD;
enced a sensation of loneliness. ,Doubtless&#xD;
the loss of her mother enhanced this feeling,&#xD;
et the peculiarity of her mientalsorganitationi&#xD;
would have necessitated it even under happi0e&#xD;

ductioniste--that womanflrintuitidnsare swift&#xD;

it not. unfrquently happens that tedious,.&#xD;
reflective processes; are ignored; but 'Irene&#xD;
was a patient rather than brilliant thinher,-&#xD;
and with singular perseverance searched every  :&#xD;

barometer, and wondering why the quicksilver&#xD;
varied with sunshine and shower,' she would&#xD;
throw herself down on the floor and 'fall asleep&#xD;
ovet the quaint pictures in an old English en-&#xD;
cyclopedia,' numbering thirty volumes. She&#xD;
haunted this room,,and grew up among books&#xD;
centlies old. Thus until her tenth year there&#xD;
was no authority exerted over her, 'and the&#xD;
strong, reflective tendency of her mind rapidly&#xD;
developed itself.  This was an abnormal, con'&#xD;
dition, and indisputably an unfortunate train-'&#xD;
ing, and perhaps in after years it might have&#xD;
been better hadshe spent the season of care-&#xD;
less, thoughtless childhood in childish sports&#xD;
and childhood's wonted ways, for anxious&#xD;
inquiry land tedious investigations come soon&#xD;
enough with maturity.&#xD;
She was not an enthusiastic, impulsive nat-&#xD;
ure; fitful in moodiness or ecetacy, inclined to&#xD;
passionate demonstrations. of, any kind ; but,&#xD;
from infancy evinced a'calm, equable temper-&#xD;
amedt, uniformly generous and unselfish, but&#xD;
most thoroughly firm,,nay obstinate,in any&#xD;
matter involving principle or conflicting with&#xD;
her opinions of propriety.. How she- obtained&#xD;
these notions of right and wrong in minor de-&#xD;
tails, was a 'subject of some mystery. They&#xD;
weke not the result of education in the ordi-&#xD;
nary acceptation of that term, for they had&#xD;
never been instilled by anybody; and, likea&#xD;
wood-flower in some secluded spot, she lived,&#xD;
drew, and expanded her nature, without any&#xD;
influences to 'bias or color her views. In her&#xD;
promiscuous reading she was quite as apt to im-&#xD;
bibe poisonous as healthy sentiments; and&#xD;
knowing that she had been blessed with few&#xD;
religious instructions, her father often wonder-&#xD;
ed at the rigidness of her codtefor self-regular&#xD;
tion. ,Miss Margaret considered her "a strange&#xD;
little thing," and rarely interfered with her&#xD;
plans in any respect, while her father seemed&#xD;
to take it for granted'thatr she requi-ed no&#xD;
looking after. He knew that her beauty was&#xD;
extraordinary; he was proud of the fact; and&#xD;
having provided her-with agood music-master,&#xD;
and sent her to the best school in the county,&#xD;
he left her to employ her leisure as inclination&#xD;
prompted. Occasionally her will conflicted&#xD;
with his, and more than once he found it im-&#xD;
possible to make her yield assent to his'wishes.&#xD;
To the outward observan~ces of obedience and-&#xD;
respect she' submitted, b; whenever these dif-&#xD;
ferees occurred he felt that in 'the end she&#xD;
was unconquaered. 'Inconsistent' as it may ap-&#xD;
pear, though fretted for 'the time by her firm-&#xD;
ness,,'he 'loved her the more for' her "'iilful-&#xD;
ness," as he termed' it ; and despotic and ex-&#xD;
acting; though'1 certainly wasin many re-&#xD;
spects, he stood  mewhat in awe of his pure-&#xD;
he-ated,.calm-eyed.chil. Hi s wa  ridneh-&#xD;
&#xD;
instance nave rise to a deal of gossiping com-&#xD;
ment.    ow the matter became public he&#xD;
never knew; probably Sparrowgrasse's "e -&#xD;
rier-pigeon" migrated southward, for it is now&#xD;
no uncommon thing to find one in our cities&#xD;
and country towns; and at all events Mr. Hun&#xD;
tingdon soon found that his private domestic&#xD;
affairs were made an ordinary topic of con-&#xD;
versation in social circles. Irene had never&#xD;
been officially apprised of her destiny, but sur-&#xD;
mised very accurately the truestate of the case.&#xD;
Between the two cousins there existed not the&#xD;
slightest congeniality of taste or disposition;&#xD;
not a sympathetic link, save the tie of relation-&#xD;
ship. On her part there was a moderate share&#xD;
of cousinly affection; on his, as much love and&#xD;
tenderness as his selfish nature was capable of&#xD;
feeling. They rarely quarrelled as most chil-&#xD;
dren do, ?or when (as frequently happened) he&#xD;
flew into a rage and tried to tyrannize, she&#xD;
scorned to retort in any way, and generally&#xD;
locked' him out of the library. What she&#xD;
thought' of her father's intentions' concerning&#xD;
herself, no one knew ; she never alluded tothe&#xD;
subject, and if in a frolicsometmood Hughs&#xD;
broached it, she invariably cut the discussion&#xD;
short. When he went to college in ahdistant&#xD;
state she felt infinitely relieved, and during his~&#xD;
vacations secluded herself asmuch as possible.&#xD;
Yet the' girl's heart was warm and clinging;&#xD;
she loved her father devotedly, and loved most'&#xD;
intensely Electra Grey, whom she had first met&#xD;
at school. They were nearly the ,same age,&#xD;
classmates, and firm friends. That she was&#xD;
beautiful, Irene of course knew quite as well&#xD;
as her father or any one else; how could she&#xD;
avoid knowin it ' From her cradle she had&#xD;
been called" Queen" and "Beauty;" all her&#xD;
acquaintances flattered her-strangers om-&#xD;
mented onher loveliness; she no more doubted&#xD;
it than the fact of her existence; and often&#xD;
stopped before the large parlor mirrors and ad-&#xD;
mired her own image, just as she would have&#xD;
examined and admired andenjoyed one of the&#xD;
elegant azaleas or pelargonimus in the green-&#xD;
house. I repeat it, she prized and enjoyed her&#xD;
loveliness, but she was not vain. She was no&#xD;
more spoiled by adulation than a meek and&#xD;
snowy camellia, or one of those immense gold-&#xD;
en~eyed pansies which astonish and delight&#xD;
visitors at the hothouses on Long Island. God&#xD;
conferred, marvellous beauty on her, and 'she&#xD;
was grateful' for the gift--but to the miserable&#xD;
weaknesses 'of- vanity'she wa a stranger.) In&#xD;
the midst of books and rowe's she was happ&#xD;
and seemed to desire no companions but sre-&#xD;
bus and Paragon. She rode every day when&#xD;
the weather' permitted, and the, jetty horse,&#xD;
with its gr~eeful young rider, followed by the&#xD;
everyhill ndvrley   ihi n ten milesof the&#xD;
&#xD;
found the earliest sprays of graybeard that&#xD;
powdered the forest. Often Mr. Huntingdon&#xD;
had ordered his horse andagone ou$, in the&#xD;
dusky twilight to'search for her, fearing that&#xD;
some disaster had overtaken his darling, and.&#xD;
at such times met Erebus laden with her favor-&#xD;
ite flowers., -'These were the things she loved;&#xD;
and thus, independent of society, yet conscious'&#xD;
of her isolation, she grew up what nature in-&#xD;
tended her to be.&#xD;
As totally different in'character as appear-&#xD;
ance was Electra Grey. Rather smaller and,&#xD;
much thinner'than Irene, with shining purplish&#xD;
black hair, large,' sad, searching black eyes,'&#xD;
from which there was no escape, a pale livee&#xD;
complexion, and full crimson lips that rarely&#xD;
smiled.' The forehead was broad and promi-&#xD;
nent, and rendered very peculiar by the' re-&#xD;
markable width between the finely-arched&#xD;
brows, The serene purity .characteristic of&#xD;
Irene's features was' entirely wanting,'in' this,&#xD;
face, which would have seemed Jewish in its&#xD;
contour but fbr the Grecian nose; and the&#xD;
melancholy yet fascinating eyes haunted the&#xD;
beholder with their restless, wistful, far-reach-.&#xD;
ing expression. Electra was a dreamer, richly&#xD;
gifted'; dissatisfied because she could never&#xD;
attain thatunreal world which her busy brain&#xD;
kept" constantly before her. The child of&#xD;
Genius is rarely, if evlr, a; happy one.--&#xD;
"Heaven lies about us in our infancy."&#xD;
If so, its recollections cling tenaciously to&#xD;
those who, like Electra, seek continually for&#xD;
the airy castles of an ideas realm. Her vivid&#xD;
imagination shaped and painted, but, as too&#xD;
often happens, her eager blood and bone&#xD;
fingers could not grasp theglories. The thou-&#xD;
sand cares, hardships, and rough handlings of&#xD;
Reality struck gold and jarring' on, her sensi-&#xD;
tive, highly-strung nature. She did not com-&#xD;
plain; murmuring words had never crossed&#xD;
her lips in the hearing of any who knew her ?&#xD;
she loved her aunt too well to speak of sor-&#xD;
row or disappointment.' Fourteen years'-had&#xD;
taught her an unusual amount of stoicism, but&#xD;
sealed''lips- can not sepulchre grief, and trials&#xD;
have a language which will not be repressed&#xD;
when the mouth is at rest. She 'looket not&#xD;
gloomy, nor yet quite unhappy, but like one&#xD;
who sees obstacles mountain-high loom between&#xD;
her anq the destined goal, and ,sks only per-&#xD;
mission to press on.. Hers was a passionate&#xD;
nature ; fierce blood beat .in, heir veins,- and&#xD;
would not always be bound by icy fetters.I&#xD;
There was no serene plateau of theling where -&#xD;
she could repose ; she enjoy ed keenly, raptu-t&#xD;
rously, and suffered acutely, fearfulljyj Untbrt-Y&#xD;
&#xD;
the towering steeps crowned with the Teeple&#xD;
of Art. To. be an artist; to put on canvas&#xD;
the grand and imperishableinages that crow'&#xD;
ed her brain, and almost maddened her becauSe,&#xD;
she could lot give them tangible frin---this&#xD;
was the day-dreas spanning ,her life like :a&#xD;
bow of, promise, but fading; slowly : as ?eats&#xD;
thickened o'er her head and no helpingg hand&#xD;
cleated the choked path. "Â«Poverty I pover-&#xD;
ty I" Many a:night she buried her face und4&#xD;
the pillow and hissed the word through closed&#xD;
teeth, fearful of disturbing the aunt 'whoslutn-&#xD;
bered at her side. Poverty'! poverty! What&#xD;
an intolerable chain it binds around aspiring&#xD;
souls I And yet 'the world's great :thinkers&#xD;
have felt this iron in their flesh, andybursting&#xD;
'the galling bonds, have carved their way' to&#xD;
,eminence, to immortality. 'It isalamentable'&#xD;
and significant truth that, with'a few honora-&#xD;
ble, noble, exceptions; wealth is the Canneof&#xD;
American intellect. -Poverty is a rigid, school,&#xD;
and the sessions, are long, and bitter ; but the&#xD;
men and women who graduate therein 'come&#xD;
forth with physical frames capable of enduring&#xD;
all hardships,.with hearts habituated f6 disap-&#xD;
pointment and fortified' against thie rebuffs of&#xD;
fortune, with intellects trained by patient,&#xD;
laborious, unbending application. The ten-&#xD;
derly-nurtured, child of wealth and luxury&#xD;
very naturally ,and reasonably shrines from&#xD;
difficulties; but increase the .obstacles in the&#xD;
path. of a son or daughter of penury, inured&#xD;
to trial, and in the same ratio you strengthen&#xD;
his or her ability and',determination to sur4&#xD;
mount them.&#xD;
Electra's love of drawing had early dis-&#xD;
played itself; first, in' strange, -weird figures&#xD;
on her slate, then in her copy-book, on every&#xD;
slip of paper"which she could lay her hands .&#xD;
upon; an,.finally, for want of more suitable&#xD;
material, she scrawled all over the walls of&#xD;
the little bedroom, to the great horrorof her&#xD;
aunt, who spread a coat of whitewash 'over&#xD;
the child's frescos, and begged her to be guilty&#xD;
of no such conduct in future, as:Mr. ,Clark&#xD;
might with 'reat justice sue for denma es.n&#xD;
utter humiliation Electra retreated to the&#xD;
garden, and-here, after a shower hadsleft the&#xD;
sandy walks white and" smooth, .she would&#xD;
sharpen a bit of pine, and - draw figures and&#xD;
faces of all conceivable 'and d inconceivable,,ae  C ncgtofd,'rths'eg  d&#xD;
one Sunday afternoon, Russell supplied her ,&#xD;
with a pack of drawing'p aper'and pancils.&#xD;
So long. as', these lasted, i was 'perfectly&#xD;
happy, but' unluckily their straitened'-dr-&#xD;

followed the master's form-boW hungrily they&#xD;
dwelt uyoux the -sketches he leaned, over to&#xD;
examine 'aid retouch !. Frequently during&#xD;
drawing-hour the would sit with 'her head bent&#xD;
down pretending to, study; but the pages of.&#xD;
the book were generally blistered with tears&#xD;
which no eye bit the Father's looked A:pon.&#xD;
There was, however, one enjoyment wich&#xD;
nothing could; steal from her : the town con-&#xD;
tained two book-stores, and here she was wont&#xD;
to liniet over the numerous engravings and&#xD;
occasional ,oil-paintings they boasted.  The&#xD;
proprietors'and clerks seemed.rather pleased&#xD;
than otherwise by the silent homage she paid&#xD;
their pictures, and, except to tender her a&#xD;
seat, no on&amp;amp;ever interfered with her examina-&#xD;
tions. One engraving interested her particu-&#xD;
larly: it represented Ot. John on Patmos,&#xD;
writing Revelations.'Â° She went as usual one&#xD;
Saturday:morning for anothe*plook at it, but&#xD;
a different :design hung in its place; .she&#xD;
glanced around, and, surmising the object of&#xD;
her search the proprietor , told her .it had&#xD;
been sold the day- before.'- Anexpression of&#xD;
sorrow crossed her face, as though she had&#xD;
sustained an irreparable loss, and, drawing&#xD;
her bonnet down, she went slowly homeward.&#xD;
Amid all these 'yearnings and aspirations she&#xD;
turned constantly to Russell with a worship..&#xD;
ing love that knew no bounds. She loved&#xD;
her meek, affectionate aunt as well as most&#xD;
natures-love 'their mothers, and did all in her&#xD;
'power to li'h'ten her labors, but her affection&#xD;
for Russell Bordered on adoration. In a char-&#xD;
acter so exacting and passionate as hers there&#xD;
is, necessarily much of jealousy, and, thus 'it&#xD;
came to pasp that, on the day of Irene's visit&#xD;
to the .cottage, the horrible suspicion took&#xD;
possession of her that 'he loved Irene better&#xD;
than.herself. True, she was very young, but&#xD;
childish hearts feel as keenly as those of ia-&#xD;
turer years'; and Electra, endured more agony&#xD;
during that day -than in all of her past life.&#xD;
Had Irene been other than she was, in every&#xD;
respect, she would probably have hated ,her&#xD;
cordially ; as matters stood, she buried , the&#xD;
suspicion deep in her own heart, and kept as&#xD;
uch out of everybody's way as possible.1Days&#xD;
and weeks passed very wearily ; she busied&#xD;
herself with her text-books, and, when the&#xD;
lessons- had been recited, drew all over the&#xD;
margins-here a hand, there anynentire arm,&#xD;
now' and then a face, sad-eyed as Fates&#xD;
Mrs. Aubrey's eyes became so blurred that&#xD;
finally she could not leave the 'house without&#xD;
! having some one to guide her, and, as cold&#xD;
weather had ;now arrived, prepatations were&#xD;
imade fo her journey. Mr. Hi1 , who was gO-&#xD;
ing to New, Orleans, kindly offered to take&#xD;
flcharge of her, and the day of' departure was&#xD;
6xed. ' Electra packed the'little'trunk 'saw it&#xD;
peosited on the to of the stage, in the dawn&#xD;
ofan October morning saw her-aunt comforta-&#xD;
&#xD;
bly seated beside Mr.- Hill, and in another&#xD;
moment ali'had vanished. In the afternoon of&#xD;
that -day, on returning from school; Electra&#xD;
went to the bureau, and, unlocking a drawer,&#xD;
took out -a small paper box. It contained a&#xD;
miniature of her Mather, s';t in a handsome&#xD;
gbld frame. ,She knew it had'been her moth-&#xD;
er'samost valued trinket ; her aunt had care-&#xD;
fully kept it for her, and as often as the temp-&#xD;
tation assailed her she had resisted ; but now&#xD;
the longing for money triumphed over every&#xD;
other feeling: Having touched' the spring,&#xD;
she took a knife and cautiouslyremoved the&#xD;
bit of ivory beneath the glass, then deposited&#xD;
the two last in the box, putthe.gold frame in&#xD;
her pocket, and went out to a jewelry-store.&#xD;
As several persons: had preceded her, she&#xD;
leaned against the counter, and, while waiting,&#xD;
watched with some curiosity the movements of&#xD;
one of the goldsmniths, who, with a glass - over&#xD;
one eye, was engaged in repairing watches.&#xD;
Some had been taken from their cases, others&#xD;
were untouched; and as her eyes passed swift-&#xD;
ly over the latter, they were' suddenly riveted&#xD;
to a massive gold one lying somewhat apart.&#xD;
A  half-smothered exclamation caused the&#xD;
workman-to turn round and look at her; but&#xD;
in an. instant she calmed herself, and, thinking&#xD;
it a mere outbreak of !impatience, he resume&#xD;
his employment. Just then one of the propri-&#xD;
etors approached, and said politely, "I am&#xD;
sorry we have kept you waiting, Miss. What&#xD;
can I do for you ?"&#xD;
" What is this worth ?"&#xD;
She laid the lodket down on the counter&#xD;
and looked up at him with eyes that sparkled&#xD;
very joyously, he thought. He examined it a&#xD;
moment, and said rather drily :&#xD;
" It is worth little or nothing to us, though&#xD;
you-may prize it." k; ,&#xD;
" If I were to buyanother jest like it, would&#xD;
.you charge me.'little or nothing?' "&#xD;
He smiled good-humor'edly.&#xD;
" Buying and selling 'are different thing,&#xD;
don't you'now that ? Come, tell me wha&#xD;
you want to sell this for ?"&#xD;
" Because I want some money."&#xD;
" You are Mrs. Aubrey's niece, I believe ?"&#xD;
" Yes, sir.""&#xD;
"Well, how do I know, iii the first place,&#xD;
that it belongs to you ? Jewellers haveito be&#xD;
very particular about what they buy."&#xD;
She crimsoned, and drew herself proudly&#xD;
away from the counter, then smiled, and held.&#xD;
out her band for the l6eket. ,1&#xD;
" It is ine ; it held my father's miniature,&#xD;
but I'took it out because I want a paint-box,&#xD;
and thought I could sell this case for enough',&#xD;
to buy one. It was my mother's once; here&#xD;
are her initials on the back-Hi. G., Hiarrat&#xD;
Grey.s But of course you don't know whether&#xD;
I am telling the truth ; I will bring my cousin&#xD;
with me; le can prove it. Sir, are .you so&#xD;
particular about everything you buy ?"&#xD;
"We tr to be."&#xD;
&#xD;
Again her eyes sparkled; she bowed, and&#xD;
left the store.&#xD;
Once in the street, she hurried to Mr. Camp-&#xD;
bell's office, ran up the steps, and rapped loudly.&#xD;

"'Comein" thundered tlte'lawyer,&#xD;
She stopped on the threshold, glanced round,&#xD;
and said timidly:&#xD;
" I want to see Russell, if you please."&#xD;
"Russell is at the post-office. Have you any&#xD;
particlar spite at mny door, that you belabor it,&#xD;
in that style'? or do you suppose I am as deaf&#xD;
as a ate-post?'       -&#xD;
"' beg you pardon; I did not mean to&#xD;
startle you, sir. I was pot thinking of either&#xD;
you or your door."&#xD;
. She 'sprang down the- steps to wait on the'&#xD;
sidewalk for her cousin,, and met him at the&#xD;
entrance.&#xD;
" Oh, Russell! I have found your watch."&#xD;
A ray of light seemed to leap from his eyes&#xD;
as he seized her hand.-&#xD;
" Where ?"&#xD;
" At Mr. 'Brown's jewelry-store."&#xD;
" Thank God I"&#xD;
'He went up the stairway, delivered the&#xD;
letters, and came back, accompanied by. Mr.&#xD;
Campbell.&#xD;
"This is my cousin, Electra Grey, Mr. Camp-&#xD;
bell."&#xD;
" So I inferred from the, unceremonious&#xD;
assault' she madae on my door just now. How-&#xD;
ever, shake hands, little lady; it seems.there is&#xD;
some reason for your haste. Let's hear about&#xD;
this precious watch business."    -&#xD;
She simply told what she had seen, Pres-&#xD;
ently Russell said:     ,.&#xD;
"But how did you happen there,'Electra&#xD;
" Your good*,angel sent me, I suppose ; -"&#xD;
and she added, in a whisper, " I will tell you&#xD;
some other time."&#xD;
'On re-entering the store she walked at once&#xD;
to the workman's corner and pointed out the&#xD;
watch.&#xD;
" Yes, it is mine. I would know it among a'&#xD;
thousand."&#xD;
" How can you identify it, Aubrey ?"&#xD;
He immediately gave the number, and name&#xD;
of the manufacturer, and described the interior&#xD;
tracery, not omitting the quantity of jewels.&#xD;
Mr. Campbell turned to the proprietor (the&#xD;
same gentleman with -whom Electra had con-&#xD;
versed), and briefly recapitulated the circum-&#xD;
stances which had occurred in connection with&#xD;
the watch. Mr. Br6wn -listened attentively,&#xD;
then requested Russell to point out the particu-&#xD;
lar one that resembled his. He did so, and on&#xD;
examination the number, date, name, and all&#xD;
the marks corresponded so exactly that no&#xD;
doubt remained on the jewelle s di .&#xD;
"Young man,-you say onu were ac'6used1 of&#xD;

"Did he wear green glasses ?" inqu red&#xD;
Russell of 'the young man who had yurehased&#xD;
the watch.&#xD;
"Yes, and had one amin a sing.&#xD;
"I saw such a man here about the tim y&#xD;
watch was missing."&#xD;
After soma directions from Mi.. Capbell&#xD;
concerning the 'proper course to be prsued,&#xD;
Electra drew out her locket, saying.-&#xD;
" Now, Russell, is not this locket min?&#xD;
" Yes; but where 'is the'miiature ?  Wha&#xD;
are you going to do with it ?"&#xD;
" The miniature, is it home, but T apt t,&#xD;
sell the frame, and Mr. 'Brown does iot know&#xD;
but that it is another watch case ?"&#xD;
"" If it is necessary, I will swear that 'it be.&#xD;
longs lawIlly to you; but what do you want&#xD;
to sell it for'? I should think you  would prize,.&#xD;
it too highly to be willing to part with it.",'&#xD;
" I do prize the miniature, and would not&#xD;
part with it for any consideration; but I want&#xD;
something far more than a gold case to keep&#xD;
it mn."&#xD;
" Tell" me what you want, and I will get it&#xD;
for you," whispered her cotfh.&#xD;
"No ; I am going to self this frame,"&#xD;
"And I an going to buyit from you," said&#xD;
the kind-hearted iperchant, taking it from her&#xD;
hand and weighing it;.&#xD;
Russell and Mr. Campbell left the store, and&#xD;
soon after Mr. Browd paid 'lectra sevral&#xD;
dollars for the locket.&#xD;
In half an hour she had purchased a smill&#xD;
box of paints, a supply of drawing-paper and'&#xD;
pencils, and returned hom, happier 'and&#xD;
prouder than mny an empress 'whose jewels&#xD;
have equalled those of .the Begums of Onde.&#xD;
She had cleared Russell's character,,and her&#xD;
hands were pressed over her 'heart to still its&#xD;

his nature w1;s stern,,and now he exulted -in&#xD;
the power of disgracing thesop of the man&#xD;
who had wronged him. There'was .no flush-&#xD;
on his face, but a cold, triumphant glitter in&#xD;
is eyes as he approached his former employ-&#xD;
er, and laid watch and letter before him.Y&#xD;
" What business have you here ?" growled&#xD;
the.merchant, trembling before the expression&#xD;
of the boys countenance.&#xD;
"oMy business is to clear my character which&#xD;
you have slandered, and to fix the disgrace you&#xD;
intended for ne on your own son. I brig&#xD;

"Come into the back room; I will see Brown&#xD;
another time," said Mr. Watson, growing paler&#xD;
each moment.&#xD;
" No, sir; you were not sp secret in your&#xD;
dealings with me. Here where yod insulted&#xD;

The unfortunate father perused the letter&#xD;
slowly, and smothered a groan. Russell watch-,&#xD;

blushed to acknowledge had ,he analyzed his&#xD;

Mr. Watsn4aid:&#xD;
" Have you applied to the witnesses referred&#xD;

"uYes; they are ready to swear that they&#xD;

"You did, not tell them the circumstances,&#xD;

He paused suddenly, for the image of is&#xD;
&#xD;
entle, forgiving mother rose before him, and&#xD;
e knew that she would be grieved at the-&#xD;
spirit he evinced. There was an awkward&#xD;
silence, broken by Mr. Watson.&#xD;
1f I retract all that I have said against&#xD;
you, and. avow your innocence, will it satisfy&#xD;
you?   Will you be silent about Cecil ?''&#xD;
"No!" rose peremptorily to ,his lips, but he&#xD;
checked it,;. and the patient teaching of years,&#xD;
his mother's precepts and his mother's prayers&#xD;
brought forth their first fruit-golden Charity.&#xD;
"You merit no forbearance at my hands,&#xD;

were always despotic and ungenerous, but I&#xD;
tam sorry for you now, for you have taught me&#xD;
how heavy is the -burden you have to bear in&#xD;
future. Good-morning"&#xD;
Afraid to trust himself, he turned, away and'&#xD;
joined Mr. Campbell in the office.&#xD;
In the afternoon of the same day came a&#xD;
letter from Mr. Hill containing sad news.&#xD;
The oculist had -operated on Mrs. Aubrey's&#xD;
eyes, but violent inflammation had ensued-; he&#xD;
had done all that scientific skill could prompt,&#xD;
but feared she would be hopelessly blind. At&#xD;
the close of the letter Mi. Hill stated that he&#xD;
would bring her home the following week.&#xD;
One November. evening, just before dark,&#xD;
while Russell was cutting wood for the kitch-&#xD;
en-fire, the stage stopped at the cottage-gate,&#xD;
and he hurried forward to receive his mother&#xD;
in his arms. ,It was a melancholy reunion;&#xD;
for a moment the poor sufferer's fortitude for-&#xD;
sook her, and she wept. But his caresses&#xD;
soothed her, and she followed Electra into&#xD;
the house while he broucht- in the trunk.&#xD;
When shawl and bonnet iad been removed,&#xD;
and Electra placed, her in the rocking-chair,&#xD;
the light fell on face and, figure, and the cous-&#xD;
ins.started at the change that had taken place.&#xD;
She was so ghastly pale, so very much reduced.&#xD;
'She told them all that had occurred during&#xD;
the tedious-weeks, of absence ; how much she&#xD;
regretted having gone since the trip proved so&#xD;
unsuccessful; how much more she deplored&#xD;
the affliction on their account than her own ;&#xD;
and then from that hour no allusion was-ever&#xD;
made to it.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
Weeks and months slipp   away, and total&#xD;
darkness came down on     e   widow. She&#xD;
groped 'with,some 'diiculty frorp room to room,&#xD;
and Electrawas compelled to remain at home&#xD;
and watch over ,her. Russell had. become a&#xD;
great favorite withl.his crusty engl~oyer, and,&#xD;
when the labors of 'the office were ended, ,&#xD;
,brought hopme such books-'as he 'needed, and..&#xD;
spent his evenings in study. His powers of&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MACARIA&#xD;
&#xD;
applipatipn 'and endurance, were extraordi-'&#xD;
nary; and his progress was in the same ratio.&#xD;
As he became more  nd more ashorbes Ino&#xD;
these pursuits 'his 'erve andetaciturnityy in-&#xD;
creased, and his habiitually' hasty step and, ab-&#xD;
strActed expression of eountenance told of a&#xD;
strong nature straining at powers to 'the ut-&#xD;
most to attain some 4dstantglimmering goal.&#xD;
His employer was partieMariy impressed b&#xD;
the fact'that he ever voluneered, remiark&#xD;
on any subject, and rarlyopened ha lips ext'&#xD;
cept to ask some necessary in foniation in&#xD;
connection with his business. Sometimes the&#xD;
silence of the office wasnugbroken+ for hours,&#xD;
save by the dull setichra ig ofipens, oran&#xD;
impatient exclamation from ,.Mr.Campbell.&#xD;
Respectful in deportment, attentive tois dus-&#xD;
ties, never presuming upon kindness, constant-&#xD;
ly at work from morning until night, yet with&#xD;
an unmistakable sorrow printed on his face--&#xD;
a sorrow never obtrudedon anyone, never&#xD;
alludied-to-he won firt the rigid scrutiny of&#xD;
the lawyer, then his deepest, most abiding&#xD;
affection. Naturally cold and undemonstra-&#xD;
tive in manner, Mr. Campbell gave .,little evi-&#xD;
dence of feeling of any kind, yet the piercing&#xD;
blue eye lost its keenness when resting onvthe&#xD;
tall, stalwart form of the clerk, and once ;or-&#xD;
twice the ,wrinkled hand sought his broad'&#xD;
shoulder almost caressingly.. Head not mar-&#xD;
ried; had neither other nor sistersto keep&#xD;
his nature loving and gentle; and, though he&#xD;
occasionally visited his brother, who, was a&#xD;
minister-in the same town, he was held in awe&#xD;
by the members of thap brother's family. He&#xD;
comprehended Russell's character, and quietly&#xD;
facilitated'his progress. , There was no -syco-&#xD;
phancy on the part of the young man; no&#xD;
patronage on that of the employer.&#xD;
One afternoon Irene tapped lightly at the&#xD;
cottage-door, and entered the kitchen. . Mrs.'&#xD;
Aubrey sat in alow chair close to the fireplace,&#xD;
engaged in knitting ; 'her smooth, neat calico&#xD;
dress and spotless, linen collar told that care-&#xD;
ful hands tended her, and the soft auburn&#xD;
hair brushed ofer her temples showed broad&#xD;
bands of gray as the evening sun shone on it.&#xD;
She turned her brown, sightless eyes toward-&#xD;
the door, and asked in a low voice :&#xD;
"Who is it ?"&#xD;
"It is only me,  Mrs. Aubrey."&#xD;
Irene best down, laid her two hands on the&#xD;
widow's, and kissed her forehead.&#xD;
"I am glad, to hear your''voice, Irene; it&#xD;
has been a long time since ypu were here."&#xD;
"Yes, a good many weeks, I'lnow ; ,but I&#xD;
could not come" '''&#xD;
"Are you well? Your hands and face are 1&#xD;
cold."&#xD;
" Yes, thank you, very well. I am always&#xD;
cold, I believe. Hugh says Iam. Here are&#xD;
some flowers from the greenhouse. I brought&#xD;
them because they are sofragrant; and here, I&#xD;
too, are a few oranges from. the sane, p lace. I&#xD;
Rush!I don't thank med f you please. I wish&#xD;

J could cone here oftener. I always f'el bet-&#xD;

" Why not, -Irene ?"&#xD;
" Oh, because of various things. 'etween&#xD;
school and music, and riding and reading, I&#xD;
have very little time; and, besides, father&#xD;
wants me with him when lhe, is athong  I&#xD;

kinal which proclaims the actual pretense of&#xD;
God; nover hear n voice as from the solitudes&#xD;
of an oracle pronouncing the words of iinior-&#xD;
tality .'&#xD;
How then does it happen, Mrs. Aubrey,&#xD;
that different churches teach such conflicting&#xD;
dootrines ? Why are there d dmany denoini-&#xD;
nstions ?. If the teachings of the Bible are so'&#xD;
plain, how can sudh various creeds arise ?'.&#xD;
'Because poor -hukhan nature is so full of&#xD;
foibles.;because charity, the fundamental doe-&#xD;
trine of Christ, is almost losteight of by those.&#xD;
ehurOhes; it has dwindled into a mere speck,&#xD;
in comparison with the' trifles which they have'&#xD;
magnified to user  its place. Instead of once&#xD;

of the New  Testament, praetising the true&#xD;
spirit of the Saviour, andin geilumne charity&#xD;
alowing-its members to judge 'for themselves&#xD;
in the minor' questions relating to religion-&#xD;
sLk0 for instance as the mode'of baptism, the&#xD;

established, the menibers of' each sect- flf&#xD;
themselves to the aggradisierent of 'their&#xD;
peculiar church; and thus it -comnes 'to pass&#xD;
&#xD;
that instead of one vast brotherhood, united&#xD;
against sin and infidelity, they are disgracefully&#xD;
*'angling about sectarian matters of no eon-&#xD;

I wish most earnestly that these denomiiatin-&#xD;

Christ."&#xD;
"-Mrs. Aubrey, do you beIdng to any&#xD;
chut'ch ?",&#xD;
" Yes, Irene, because Christ founded a&#xD;
church, -ahd I think every ian and woman&#xD;
should belong to some religious organization.&#xD;
Moreover, unless a member of some one of&#xD;
the denominations, you can not commune;&#xD;
and, asihe acrament particularly established&#xD;
by our Saviour, all ought to be able to partake&#xD;
of-It. I think it a matter of little consequence&#xD;
which of the evangelical sects one selects-&#xD;
Do not imagine that I believe people can only&#xD;
be saved b7 entrance into some. church ; I&#xD;
think no such thing ; the church is a valuable&#xD;
instrument, but 'God who established it can&#xD;
work without it. Still, it is very reasonable&#xD;
to suppose that regular attendance on divine&#xD;
service fosters piety, and keeps the subject of&#xD;
our duty more'constantly before us."&#xD;
She had fiished her knitting, aid sat with&#xD;
her thin hands folded -in her lap-the meek&#xD;
face more than usually serene, the sightless&#xD;
eyes directed 'toward h'er visitor. Sunshine&#xD;
flecked the bare boards under the window,&#xD;
flashed on the tin vessels ranged on .the&#xD;
shelves, and lingered like . a halo around&#xD;
Irene's head. Her hair swept on the floor,&#xD;
and- the cat played now and then with the&#xD;
golden rings so softly as not to attract notice,&#xD;
as though cotisciousthe new toy was precious.&#xD;
The countenances of the group contrasted&#xD;
vividly : the sweet resignation 'of the blind&#xD;
sufferer, the marble purity of Irene's face, and,&#xD;
just in the rear, Electra's broad, pale brow and&#xD;
restless, troubled, midnight eyes. The latter&#xD;
had been drawing at the table in the middle&#xD;
,of the room, and now sat leaning on her hand,&#xD;
watching the two at the fire. . Presently Irene&#xD;
approached and began to examine the draw-&#xD;
ings, which were fragmentary, except one ot&#xD;
two heads, and',a sketch taken 'from the bank&#xD;
opposite the Falls. After some moments&#xD;
passed in ilobked over them, Irene addressed&#xD;
the tjuet little figure.&#xD;
n   v you been to Mr. Clifton's studio ?"&#xD;
" No;wh6ois he?"&#xD;
" An Mtist from 'New York. His health is&#xD;
poor-, and he is speriding the winter Sodth.&#xD;
&#xD;
Have n't you heard of him ? Everybody is&#xD;
having portraits taken. He is painting mine&#xD;
now-father would make me sit again,t hogh&#xD;
he has a likeness which- was painted four&#xD;
years ago. .I am going down to-morrow 'for.&#xD;
my last sitting, and should like very much for&#xD;
you tp go with inc. Perhaps Mr. Clifton 'can,&#xD;
give you some valuable hints. Will yougo ?"&#xD;
"With great pleasure."&#xD;
"Then I will call for you a little before ten&#xD;
o'clock. Here are some crayons I bought for&#xD;
you a week ago. . Good-by."&#xD;
She left the room as quietly as'she had&#xD;
entered, and found Paragon waiting for her&#xD;
at-the door. He gambolled before her all the&#xD;
way-now darting off, and as suddenly re-&#xD;
turning, to throw himself at her feet and&#xD;
wonder w'hy she failed to caress him .as usual.&#xD;
Other thoughts engaged her now,; she could&#xD;
see nothing but the form of the widow, and&#xD;
to-day she realized more than ever before how&#xD;
much she needed a mother. Low, sweet, gen-&#xD;
tle tones rarely fell upon her ear, and, except&#xD;
her father and Dr. Arnold, no one had ever&#xD;
attempted-to caress her.. She wearied of. the&#xD;
fourteen years of isolation, and now on enter-&#xD;
ing her fifteenth looked about her for at least&#xD;
one congenial spirit. She knew of none-but&#xD;
Electraand Mrs. Aubrey -who in. any degree&#xD;
sympathized with her, and from these she was&#xD;
debarred by parental interdit. Miss Mar-&#xD;
garet, seconded by Mr, Huntingdon, now&#xD;
constantly prescribed a course of 'conduct&#xD;
detestable to the girl, who plainly ,perceived&#xD;
that as she grew older these differences.-in-&#xD;
creased. Was it her duty to submit unhesi-&#xD;
tatingly to their dictation ? Did the command&#xD;
of-filial obedience embrace all such matters,&#xD;
or was it modified-limited by the right of&#xD;
individual conscience ? This consultation was&#xD;
long and patient, and the conclusion unalter-&#xD;
able. 'She would do what she believed to be&#xD;
proper, whatever she thought her duty, at all&#xD;
hazards: She had no ones to guide her, and&#xD;
must rely only on God and her 'own heart.&#xD;
The following day Mi's Margaret accom-&#xD;
pinied -her to the studio.  As the carriage&#xD;
approached the cottage-gate Irene directed&#xD;
the driver to stop.&#xD;
 " For what ?" asked her aunt.&#xD;
"Electra'Grey is going with me.; I prom-&#xD;
ised to call for her. She ias an extraordinav&#xD;
talent for drawing, -and I want to: introduce&#xD;
her to Mr. Clifton. Open the door, Andrew."&#xD;
"Irene, are you deranged?  Your father&#xD;
never would forgive you if he knew"you-asso-&#xD;
ciated -with those people. I ca't think of&#xD;
allowing that girl to enter this enriage.&#xD;
Drive on.' I. must really speak to Leoada&#xD;
about your obstinacy in visitang'attihat-"&#xD;
" Stop, Andrew I If yo edoiu't choose 4to&#xD;
ride with Electra, Aunto " rgaet you may&#xD;
go on alone, for either she shal ide -or I will'&#xD;
walk with her."&#xD;
Andrew opened the door, and she was&#xD;
&#xD;
stepping out, when Electra appeared in 'the&#xD;
wa k and-immaediately joined er.7 Miss Mat-&#xD;
garet was thoroughly 'aroused and indig ant,&#xD;
but thought,- it best - to submit for the 'time,&#xD;
and when Irene; introduced her friend'she&#xD;
took no notice of her whatever, ekeptiby&#xD;
drawing herself up in one corner and iowev-&#xD;
ing her veil. 'The gis  talked dring 'the&#xD;
remainder-of thearde, and when they rathti&#xD;
Mr.-"Clifton's door raniusp the 'steps togethe',&#xD;
totally unmindful of ,the august 'lady's ill-&#xD;
'humor.&#xD;
The artist was standing before aneael&#xD;
which held. Irene's unfinished portrait,;andas&#xD;
he turned to greet 'his visitors Electra 'saw&#xD;
that, though thin and pale, his face was one&#xD;
of rare beauty and 'benevolence. Hisebrown&#xD;
curling hair hang loosely about his shoulders,&#xD;
and an uncommonly long beard of the same&#xD;
silky texture descended almost to his waist.'&#xD;
He shook hands with Jrene, 'and looked 'in-&#xD;
quiringly at her companion.&#xD;
u Mr. Clifton, this is Miss Electra 'Grey,&#xD;
whose drawings I mentioned to you last week.&#xD;
I wish, if you please, you would examine some&#xD;
of them when you have leisure."&#xD;
Electra looked for an instant into his large,&#xD;
clear gray eyes as 'he took her drawings, and&#xD;
said he. would be glad to a sist her, and 'knew&#xD;
that henceforth the tangled path would 'be&#xD;
smoothed and widened. She stood at the.back&#xD;
of his chair during the hour's sitting,-and with&#xD;
eculiar interest .watched'the strokes o'f his&#xD;
brush as the portrait grew under his practisea&#xD;
hand. When ,Irene rose, the orphan moved&#xD;
away and began -to' seratinize the numerous&#xD;
pictures scattered -about the room, A' gret&#xD;
joy filled'her 'heart and illuiidnediher faceand&#xD;
she waited-for the wbrds bf 'eacouiagtient&#xD;

Art is no mere pastime, as some people sup-&#xD;
ose ; an artist'slife is an arduous one at best.&#xD;
have been told something of your history;&#xD;
you are very poor, and wish to make painting&#xD;
a profession. Think well before you decide&#xD;
this, matter; remember that long, 'tedious&#xD;
mortls mutt elapse before you can hope to&#xD;
execute even an ordinary portrait. You must&#xD;
acquaint yourself with the anatomy of'the hu-&#xD;
man system before syou- undertake anything.&#xD;
I thought I had finished my course seven years&#xD;
o, but I went to Italy and soon saw that I&#xD;
had only begun to learn my'profession. Think&#xD;
well of allthis."          ,&#xD;
"1 have thought of it; I a willing to work&#xD;
any number of years ; I have decided, and I&#xD;
am not be frightened from my purpose. I am&#xD;
poor, I can barely buy the necessary mate-&#xD;
rials, much less the books, .b'ut J will be an&#xD;
artist yet. I have decided, sir; it is no new&#xD;
whim; it has been a bright dream to me all&#xD;
my life, and I am determined to realize it."&#xD;
"'Amen; so let it be, then. 'I shall remain&#xD;
here some weeks longer; come to me every&#xD;
day at ten o'clock, and I will instruct you.&#xD;
You shall'have such books as you need, and.&#xD;
with perseverance you have nothing-to fear."&#xD;
He went into the adjoining room and re-&#xD;
turned with a small volume. As he.gave it to&#xD;
her, with some directions concerning the con-&#xD;
tents, she caught his hand to her lips, saying&#xD;
'hastily:&#xD;
" My guardian angel certainly brought you&#xD;
here to spend the winter. Oh, sir IIwill&#xD;
prove my gratitude for your.goodness  show-&#xD;
ing that I am not unworthy of it.  thank&#xD;
you from the very depths of myglad heart."&#xD;
As she released his h and left the studio&#xD;
he found two bright drops on his fingers-drops&#xD;
called forth by the most intense joy she had&#xD;
ever known. Having some commission from&#xD;
her aunt, she did not re-enter the carriage,&#xD;
and4 after thankin ;Irene for her kindness,&#xD;
-    walked away. The, ride home was very&#xD;
silent ; Miss Margaret tat stiff and icy, looking&#xD;
quite insulted, while, her neqe was too much&#xD;
engrossed by other reflections:to notice, her.&#xD;
The latter spent: the remainder of the morn-&#xD;
ing in writing to Hugh and correcting her&#xD;
French exercises, :ands when summoned to-,&#xD;
dinher she -entered the room expecting a&#xD;
storm. A glatice sufficed to show her that&#xD;
Miss ' Margaret had not .yet -spoken to her&#xD;
father, though it was evident from her coun-&#xD;
tenance thatshe was about to make what she&#xD;
considered ,an important revelation, ,The&#xD;
meal passed, however,:without any allusion to&#xD;
the.ssbjct, 'and; knowing what lshe had to&#xD;
expect, lrene immediately withdrew to the&#xD;
library to give her a1gut ansopportunity of un-&#xD;
burdening her- mind. Thee srgle must come&#xD;
some time, and she longed to have it over as&#xD;
tooas as .possible. She threw up the sash,&#xD;
seated hxerself'on the bread cadar window-sill,&#xD;
and began to work out a sum in algebra.&#xD;
&#xD;
ARIA.&#xD;
Nearly a half-hour passed ; the slamming of&#xD;
the dining-room door was like the first line or'&#xD;
foam curling and whitening the sea when the&#xD;
tempest sweeps forward ; her father stamped&#xD;
into the library, and the storm broke over&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Irenerl did n't I positively order you to&#xD;
keep away from that Aubrey family? ,What&#xD;
do you mean by setting me at defiance in this&#xD;
way, you wilful, spoiled, hard-headed piece ?&#xD;
Do you suppose I intend to put up with your&#xD;
obstinacy all my life, and let you walk rough-&#xD;
shod overme and my commands ? You have&#xD;
queened it long enough, my lady. If I don't&#xD;
rein you up, you will turn your aunt and me&#xD;
out 'of the house next, and invite that precious&#xD;
Aubrey crew to .take possession. Your con-&#xD;
founded stubbornness will ruin you yet. You&#xD;
deserve a good whipping, Miss; I can hardly&#xD;
keep my hands off of you." ..'-&#xD;
He did not ; rough hands seized her shoul-&#xD;
ders, jerked her from' the window-sill, and&#xD;
slook her violently. Down fell book, slate,&#xD;
and pencil with ,a crash; down swept the&#xD;
heavy hair, blinding her. She put it back,&#xD;
folded her hands behind her as if for support,&#xD;
and, looking up at him, said in a low, steady,&#xD;
yet grieved tone:&#xD;
" I am very sorry, you are angry with me,&#xD;
Father."&#xD;
" Devilish sorry, I dare say ! Don't be hyp-&#xD;
ocritical! Did n't I tell you to keep away&#xD;
from those people ? Doui't stand there. like a&#xD;
block of stone; answer me I"&#xD;
" Yes, sir ; but I did not promise to do so.&#xD;
I am not hypocritical, Father."&#xD;
" You did not promise, indeed-I What do I&#xD;
care for promises.? It was your duty to obey&#xD;
me."&#xD;
".I don't think it was, Father, when you re-&#xD;
-fused to give me any reason for avoiding Mrs.&#xD;
Aubrey or her family. They are unfortunate,:&#xD;
but honorable people ; and, being very poor&#xD;
and afflicted, I felt sorry fog them. I can't&#xD;
see how my going there occasionally harms&#xD;
you, or me, or anybody else. I know very&#xD;
well that you dislike them, but you never told&#xD;
me why, and I can not imagine any good&#xD;
reason for it. Father,,if I love' them, why&#xD;
should not I associate with them ?"&#xD;
"1Becagse I say you shan't ! you tormenting,'&#xD;
headstrong little imp !" -&#xD;
" My Father, that is no reason."&#xD;
"Reason! I will put you where you will&#xD;
have, no occasion for .reasons.  Oh! I can&#xD;
match you, you perverse little wretch ! I am&#xD;
pg  to send you, toa boarding-school, do you&#xD;

Aupreys to abet your obstinacy. and disobe'&#xD;

curbed. Hlow will you. relish getting up be-&#xD;

any, making .your own bed, and living on&#xD;

&#xD;
and learn common sense. Now get out of my&#xD;
With a stamp of rage he, pointed to the&#xD;
door. Hitherto she had stood quite 'still, but&#xD;
now an expression of anguish passed swiftly&#xD;
over her face, and she put out her hands ap-&#xD;
pealingly- &#xD;
"Father! my Father! don't send me away!I&#xD;
Please let me stay at home."&#xD;
"Not if I live long enough to take you..&#xD;
Just as certainly as the sun shines in heaven,&#xD;
you will go as ,soon as your clothes can be"&#xD;
made. Your aunt vill have you ready in a&#xD;
week. Don't open your mouth to me ! I&#xD;
don't want to hear another word from you.&#xD;
Take yourself off."&#xD;
She picked up heir slate and, book and left&#xD;
the room. Her hat hung on the rackin the&#xD;
hall, and, taking it down, she passed out&#xD;
through the rear piazza. Paragon leaped&#xD;
and, whined at sight of her; she unchained&#xD;
him, and, leaving the yard; turned into a nar-,&#xD;
row zigzag path leading in an opposite direc-&#xD;
tion from the .front of the house. The build-&#xD;
ing stood by quite a hill, 'one side of which&#xD;
sloped down to the brink of a creek that emp-&#xD;
tied itself into the ,river :a mile above the&#xD;
town. This declivity was thickly wooded, and,,&#xD;
on the opposite side of -the stream, a dense&#xD;
swamp stretched away. Cypress, pine,,beech,&#xD;
magnolias, towered far as the eye could reach,&#xD;
and now, in the gathering gloom of evening,&#xD;
looked sombre and solemn. This was a favorite&#xD;
haunt of Irene's; she knew every nook of the&#xD;
forest and bend of'the creek as well as the shy&#xD;
rabbits that flitted away at her approach;. and&#xD;
tn this occasion she sought a rude seat form-&#xD;
ed by the interlacing of two wild grape-vines.&#xD;
At her feet the channel ran deep and strong,&#xD;
and the rocky bed was distinctly seen; -but a&#xD;
few yards off the stream widened into a small,&#xD;
lake, and there, on its dark, still surface&#xD;
masses of water-lilies spread out their broad,&#xD;
green, glossy leaves. It was a lonely place;'&#xD;
even in the. day owls hooted one to another;&#xD;
and strange, harsh cries'were heard, from birds&#xD;
that never forsook the swamp. It was April,&#xD;
early April, and from the hill-side, fringed with&#xD;
honeysuckles of varied hue, and'festooned with&#xD;
yellow jasmine that clambered in wild luxuri-&#xD;
ance over tree and shrub, the southern breeze&#xD;
wafted spicy, intoxicating aromas. ,Redbuds&#xD;
lifted their rosy limbs against dark, polished&#xD;
magnolias, and here and there masses of snow&#xD;
told where the dogwoods grew. Clusters of&#xD;
violets embroidered tm -hill-side, and crimson,&#xD;
woodbine trailed over the ground, catching at&#xD;
every drooping bough, and'climbing stealthily,&#xD;
anxious, like all weak natures, to hang on=&#xD;
something sturdy. Ireneusually revelled amid&#xD;
this wealth of floral beauty, but now she could&#xD;
not enjoy it. She looked at her favorites, and&#xD;
understood what was meant. by the words-&#xD;
"I see thor all so excellent i rir,&#xD;
I see, not feel, how beautiful they are." .&#xD;
&#xD;
The first great grief of her life had fallen&#xD;
on her ; heretofore all* had been so:serene, so&#xD;
flowery, that she could not easily understand&#xD;
or endure the crushing weight on her heatt.&#xD;
Reared in seclusion the thought of being sent&#xD;
from hersbeautiful, luxurious home, and thrust&#xD;
among utter 'strangers, startled and filled her&#xD;
with dread. She was astonished, pained, and&#xD;
mortified by her father's harsh language; and,&#xD;
loving him very sincerely, she shrank from the&#xD;
long separation he threatened; yet, amid all&#xD;
these complex emotions, she felt not the slight-&#xD;
est regret for the 'course she had pursued;&#xD;
under similar circumstances she would again&#xD;
act just as she had done. Then came the re-&#xD;
membrance that she might meet her unfort-&#xD;
unate friends no 'more. Mrs.. Aubrey was&#xD;
evidently declining rapidly, and what would&#xD;
become of Electra and Russell ? They might&#xD;
move away; they, too, might die; nay, she&#xD;
might never come back to the home of her&#xD;
birth; death's harvest was 'in all-seasons, and,&#xD;
looking upon the lakelet, she shuddered and.,&#xD;
moaned. The snowy water-lilies glanced up&#xD;
at her, and seemed to say, as they trembled&#xD;
unceasingly in the current fair below the sur-&#xD;
face, "Bend I bend I" A passage in Dante,&#xD;
which.she had read the week before, crossed&#xD;
her mind now,. as she noted 'the constant&#xD;
swaying of the fragile flowers, so impotent to&#xD;
resist that undercurrent sweeping their roots:&#xD;
No other plant,&#xD;
Covered with leaves, or hardened in'its stalk&#xD;
There lives, not bending.to thewater's sWay."&#xD;
He had selected reeds as a type of Patience,&#xD;
but the pale, pure, quivering lilies were to her&#xD;
a far more impressive symbol of Resignation.&#xD;
An aged gnarled cypress towered above her,&#xD;
and from  the knotted limbs. drooped long&#xD;
funeral wreaths of gray'moss, fluttering mourn-&#xD;
fully in the'evening 'wind, like badges of crape&#xD;
'in houses of death. From amid this sombre&#xD;
drapery came, the lonely hoot of an owl, and,&#xD;
with a strange sensation of desolation, Irene&#xD;
fell on her knees and committed herself to the&#xD;
care of the'Great Shepherd. Darkness'closed&#xD;
around, but as she prayed the silver 'rays of&#xD;
the evening-star peered down through the&#xD;
trembling streamers of moss and gleamed on'&#xD;
the upturned' faeg. She broke one'of the&#xD;
lilies, and,'fastening it among her curls, followed&#xD;
Paragon up the hill-side.&#xD;
The week'which succeeded was wretched to&#xD;
the girl, for her father's surveillance'prevented&#xD;
her fromvisiting the cottage, even to sayadieu&#xD;
to' its 'inmates; and eno alternative presented'&#xD;
itself but to leave for them (in the hands of&#xD;
Nellie,'her devoted nurse) a' note containing a&#xD;
few parting words and assurances'of unfading&#xD;
friendship ~and -rememrbrance. -The day ' of&#xD;
departue dawned rainy, loomy, and the wind -&#xD;
sobbed and wailed down the avenue as Irene&#xD;
steod 'at her wind~wlooking .out on~ the lawn&#xD;
where her life had beei passed. Although&#xD;
Nlie was weeping bittrl   t 'er side, she.&#xD;

&#xD;
hadnot shed a tear ; but they face was full of'&#xD;
grief, and her little hands were clasped tightly&#xD;
asthe faithful nurse pressed them affectionately&#xD;
inher palms. Disengaging herself; Irene took&#xD;
an umbrella and went to tje stable for a last&#xD;
look ,at Erebus. This tried her sorely, and&#xD;
her lip was unsteady when she left him and&#xD;
sought Paragon. The latter, little suspecting&#xD;
the true state of' affairs, gambolled and whined&#xD;
as joyously as ever at her approach ; and,&#xD;
when the'crowned head went down moaningly&#xD;
on his silky neck, he barked and frisked in&#xD;
recognition of .the caress. The breakfast-bell&#xD;
summoned her away, and, a half-hour after,&#xD;
she saw the lofty columns of the old house&#xD;
fade from view, and knew that, many months,&#xD;
perhaps years, must elapse before the ancestral&#xD;
trees of the long avenue would wave again&#xD;
over the headof their young mistress. Her.&#xD;
father sat beside her, moody and silent, and,&#xD;
when the brick wall and arched iron gate&#xD;
vanished from her sight, she sank' back in one&#xD;
corner, and, covering her face with her hands,&#xD;
smothered a groan and fought desperately&#xD;
with her voiceless anguish.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
Youth is hopeful, beautifully hopeful, and&#xD;
fresh pure hearts rebound from sorrow with&#xD;
wonderful elasticity. When clouds lower and&#xD;
the way seeaps dark and tangled, Hope flies&#xD;
forward, pioneer-like, to. clear away all obsta-&#xD;
cles. Huge barriers frowned between Electra&#xD;
and the heights she strained every nerve to&#xD;
reach,.but never for an instant did she doubt&#xD;
the success of' the struggle. Like Orpheus&#xD;
seeking Eurydice, to look back was fearful&#xD;
and hazardous; and, fixing her eyes steadily.&#xD;
on the future, she allowed herself no haunting.&#xD;
foreboding.     -&#xD;
" Cry, faint notI climb the summit's slope&#xD;
-eyond the furthest figts of hope,&#xD;
Wriapt in dense cloud from base to cope."&#xD;
What human powers can endure and ac-&#xD;
complish is to be measured only by the neces-&#xD;
sity which goads, and all herculean trophies&#xD;
are won by desperate needs. The laws which&#xD;
govern our moral and intellectual natures are&#xD;
as rigid and inevitable in their operation as&#xD;
those whose wrkig we constantly trace in&#xD;
the physical orld-o' which truth the, history&#xD;
of nations and memoirs of great, men furnish&#xD;
innumerable exemplifications. Consequently&#xD;
it is both unjust and illogical to judge of the&#xD;
probability of this or thatevent or series of&#xD;
events, or.the naturalness of 'this or that char-&#xD;
acter, whether in authenticated history or fic-&#xD;
tit ous works, without a thorqugh acquaintance&#xD;
with. alt antecedents and the various relations&#xD;
surrounding the actor, Reader, as you walk&#xD;
side by side with these whose lives 1 am-nar-&#xD;
rating, bear this in mind--the silver-winged&#xD;
pigeons that/flash in a44 out of the venerable&#xD;
&#xD;
trees shading the old homestead, and coo and&#xD;
flutter amid the rainbow-spray of the fountain,&#xD;
would droop, shiver, and die on bald, awful&#xD;
Alpine pinnacles, where in the fierce howl&#xD;
and scourging of tempests eaglets wheel in&#xD;
triumph, and scream defiantly ; and tender pet&#xD;
lambs, coaxed into flowery, luxuriant mead-&#xD;
ows, would soon make- their graves in the&#xD;
murderous snow over which young. chamois&#xD;
bleat and skip in wild glee, fearless as the ever-&#xD;
lasting hills.&#xD;
Day after day Electra toiled over her work;&#xD;
the delicate frame learned its destiny, sighed&#xD;
at its future, but grew strong ; and complain-&#xD;
ing nerves, catching some of her iron resolve,&#xD;
endured patiently-became finally thoroughly&#xD;
inured to their arduous duties. Her aunt&#xD;
constantly claimed her attention for the various&#xD;
little offices so grateful to an invalid, but by&#xD;
an extraordinary alchemy she contrived to&#xD;
convert every interruption into an occasion&#xD;
of profit. If lending her arm to support the&#xD;
drooping form in a short walk around the&#xD;
little garden, she would describe the varying,&#xD;
tints of sky, as.the clouds shifted their gor-&#xD;
geous curtains of purple and scarlet and gold,&#xD;
until thoroughly familiarized with the varied&#xD;
chameleon hues and strange, grotesque out-&#xD;
lines, traced by - every rift. Nature was a&#xD;
vast storehouse of inatchless, unapproachable&#xD;
beauty to:that eager, thirsty soul-a boundless&#xD;
studio, filled with wonderfutcreations, open to&#xD;
her at all times-in the rosy,,opaline flush of&#xD;
morning, the blazing splendor of full-orbed&#xD;
noon, the silver-gray of twilight, peopled with&#xD;
dusky phantoms, weird and shifting as Fata-&#xD;
Morgana-the still sublimity, the solemn, sa-&#xD;
cred witchery of star-crowned, immemorial&#xD;
Night. She answered the first hoarse-call of&#xD;
thunder by stationing herself at the window to&#xD;
watch the stormy panorama sweep over the&#xD;
heavens; and not Ruysdael, nor Vandervelde,&#xD;
nor Turner ever gazed with more intense de-&#xD;
light on the hurrying masses of vapor than that&#xD;
fragilegirl, as she stood with the forked light-&#xD;
ning glaring luridly over her upturned, enrapt-&#xD;
ured, face. Favored - ones of fortune lean&#xD;
against marble pillars in royal museums to&#xD;
study the imperishable works of earth's grand-&#xD;
est old artists ; but she lived in a cosmopolitan&#xD;
temple whose skyey frescos were fresh' from&#xD;
the hands of Jehovah himself. The rapidity&#xD;
of her progress astonished Mr. Clifton. He&#xD;
questioned her concerning' the processes she&#xD;
employed in some of her curious combinations,&#xD;
bt the fragmentary, abstracted nature of her&#xD;
conversation during the hours of instruction&#xD;
rave him: little satisfactory information. His&#xD;
interest in her increased, until finally..it be-&#xD;
came absorbing, and he gave her all the time&#xD;
that she could spare from home. The eager-&#xD;
neas with which she listened to his directions,'&#xD;
the facility with which she applied his. rules,&#xD;
fully repaid him; and from day to day he&#xD;
postponed his return to the North, reluctant&#xD;
&#xD;
to leave his indefatigable pupil.  Now, and&#xD;
then the time of departure was fixed, but ere&#xD;
it arrived he wavered and procrastinated ,&#xD;
.Electra knew that his stay had been pro-&#xD;
longed beyond his original intention, and she&#xD;
dreaded the hour when she should be deprived&#xD;
of his aid and advice. Though their acquaint-&#xD;
ance had been so short, a strangely strong&#xD;
feeling had grown up in her heart toward&#xD;
him; a feeling of.clinging tenderness, blended-&#xD;
with earnest, undying gratitude. She knew&#xD;
that he understood her character.and appre-&#xD;
eiated her struggles, and it soothed her fierce,.&#xD;
proud heart, in some degree, to receive from&#xD;
him those tokens of constant remembrance&#xD;
which she so .yearned to have from Russell.&#xD;
She felt, too, that she was not regarded as a&#xD;
stranger by the artist ; she could see his sad&#xD;
eyes brighten at her entrance, and detect the&#xD;
tremor in his hand and voice when he spoke&#xD;
of going home. His health had improved, and&#xD;
the heat of summer had come; why did he&#xD;
linger ? His evenings were often spent at the&#xD;
cottage, and even Mrs. Aubrey learned. to&#xD;
smile at the sound of his step., .&#xD;
One morning, as Electra finished her lesson&#xD;
and rose to go, he said slowly, as if watching&#xD;
the effect of his words:&#xD;
" This is the last hour I can give you. In&#xD;
two days I ,return to New York. Letters of'&#xD;
importance oame this morning; 1 have waited&#xD;
here too long already."'&#xD;
" Are you in earnest this time ?"&#xD;
"I am;. it is. absolutely necessary that I&#xD;
should return home."&#xD;
" Mr. Cjifton, what shall I do without you ?"&#xD;
" Suppose you had never seen me ?".&#xD;
"Then I should not have had to lose you.&#xD;
Oh, sir I .1 need you 'very much."  ,&#xD;
"Electra, child, you will conquer your diffi-.&#xD;
culties without assistance from any one. You'&#xD;
have nothing to fear."&#xD;
" Yes, I know I shall conquer at last, but&#xD;
the.way wbuld be so much easier if.you were&#xD;
only with me. I shall miss you niore. than I&#xD;
can tell 'you."&#xD;
He passed his hand over her short shining&#xD;
hair, and mused for a moment as if laying&#xD;
conflicting emotions in the balance. Shesheard&#xD;
his deep, labored breathing, and saw, the&#xD;
working of the muscles in his pale face ; when&#xD;
he spoke, his voice was husky:&#xD;
" you are right; you need me, and I want&#xD;
ou always with me; we must not be parted.--&#xD;
ectra Ilsay we shall not. ' Come. to meput&#xD;
your hands in mine-promise me that you will&#xD;
be my child, my pupil; I will take you to my&#xD;
mother, and we need never be separated..&#xD;
You require aid, such as can not be had here;&#xD;
in New York yon shall have al that you want.&#xD;
Will you come with me ?"            ..&#xD;
He held her hands in a vice-like grasp,. and&#xD;
looked pleadingly into her astonished counte-&#xD;
'laance. A mist gathered before hier, and she&#xD;
closed, her eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Electra, will you come ?"r.&#xD;
"Give me ten minutes to thinkk" she a-&#xD;
swered Bhiveringly. He turned away; Aid&#xD;
walked up and down the floor, taking care to&#xD;
conceal his face. She sat down before a table&#xD;
and dropped her forehead in her palms.. What&#xD;
slight things often shape human destiny:; how&#xD;
little people realize the consequence- of seem-&#xD;
ingly trivial words, looks, or actions ! The&#xD;
day before. Electra would unhesitatingly have&#xD;
declined this proposition: but only that morn-&#xD;
ing, as she passed Russells door, before.break-&#xD;
fast, she saw him with Irene's farewell: note in&#xD;
his hand; saw him press his lips hastily to.the&#xD;
signature. Her jealous heart was on tire; the&#xD;
consciousness of his love for another rendered&#xD;
her reckless and indescribably miserable.,.Jn&#xD;
this mood she reflected: Mr. Clifton seemed&#xD;
to have become warmly attached to her, and&#xD;
could help her to attain the eminence she had&#xD;
in view; she was poor, why not accept' his&#xD;
generous offer ' Russell would npt missher-&#xD;
would not care whether she left him ,or re- /&#xD;
mined. If she were far away, at least she&#xD;
would not be torniented by. his coldnessand&#xD;
indifference. The future (barring her ambi-&#xD;
tious dreams). was dim, joyless; she had to&#xD;
earn a support, she scorned to be dependent&#xD;
on her cousin, fame lured her on. Yes, she&#xD;
would go. Mr. Clifton took out his watch and&#xD;
paused beside her:               *    .'&#xD;
" Ten minutes have passed ; - Electra, will.&#xD;
you come ?"&#xD;
She raised her bloodless face, stamped with&#xD;
stern resolve, and ere the words were pro-&#xD;
nounced he read his answer in the defiant&#xD;
gleam of her eyes, in the 'hard, curved lines of&#xD;
the mouth.&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton, I can not go with you just&#xD;
now, for at present I1 can not, ought ' not, to&#xD;
leave my aunt. Helpless as she is, it would&#xD;
be cruel, ungrateful, to desert her; but things&#xD;
can not continue this way much longer,'and I&#xD;
promise you that as soon as I can 1 will go to&#xD;
you. I want to be with you; I want some-&#xD;
body to care for me, and I know you will be a&#xD;
kind. friend always.- Most gratefully will I&#xD;
accept your generous, offer so soon as Ifeel&#xD;
that I can do so."&#xD;
He stooped and touched her .foreheadA rith&#xD;
his lips.&#xD;
" My dear Electra; I wil hield you from&#xD;
trials and difficulties.; I wil rize you above.&#xD;
everything on earth; I know you are making .&#xD;
a great sacrice to be with me ; I know how&#xD;
hard it is. for you toleave home and .relatives.&#xD;
But,, my child, your aunthasonly a short&#xD;

pipmised yourself to me."&#xD;
"I shall not forget;': but he saw her shud-&#xD;
der.&#xD;
"Shall I speak to your aunt about this&#xD;
matter before I go ?"&#xD;
No, it would only distress her ; leave it all&#xD;
with me. - It is late, and I must go. Good-by,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
He propnised to see her again before his de-&#xD;
parture, and she walked honie with her head&#xD;
bowed and a sharp continual pain gnawing at&#xD;
her heart.           .   a&#xD;
In the calm, peaceful years of ordinary&#xD;
childhood the soul matures slowly; but a vol-&#xD;
canic nature like Electra's, subj cted to galling&#xD;
trials, rapidly hardens, and answers every,&#xD;
stroke with the metallic ring of age. Keen&#xD;
susceptibility to joy or pain taught her early,&#xD;
what less impressive characters are years in&#xD;
learning, and it was lamentably ..true that,&#xD;
while yet a mere girl, she suffered as acutely&#xD;
as a woman. 'the battle of life must be.&#xD;
fought, and if one begins skirmishing in the&#xD;
cradle tactics are soon learned and the conflict&#xD;
ends more speedily. But Electra had also&#xD;
conned another lesson : to lock her troubles in&#xD;
her own heart, voicing no complaint, andwhen&#xD;
she sought her aunt, and read aloud the favor-&#xD;
ite chapters in the Bible, or led her up and&#xD;
down the garden-walk, talking of various&#xD;
things, telling- of the growth of pet plants,&#xD;
there was no indication whatever of any un-&#xD;
usual strife or extraordinary occurrence. Rus-&#xD;
sell knew that a change had come over his&#xD;
cousin, but was too constantly engaged, too&#xD;
entirely absorbed by his studies, to ask or&#xD;
analyze the cause. She never watched at the&#xD;
gate for him  now, never sprang with out-&#xD;
stretched arms to meet him, never hung over&#xD;
the back of his chair ahd caressed his hands as&#xD;
formerly. When not waiting upon her aunt&#xD;
she was as intent on .her- books as he, and,&#xD;
though invariably kind and unselfish in her&#xD;
conduct toward rim, she was evidently con-&#xD;
strained in his presence. As the summer wore'&#xD;
on Mrs. Aubrey's health failed rapidly, and she&#xD;
was confined to her couch. There, in a low&#xD;
chair close to the pillow, sat Electra reading,&#xD;
talking, exertipg-herself to the utmost to cheer&#xD;
the widow. She filled the thin fingers with&#xD;
dewy roses, and bpatiated on the glories of&#xD;
thseouter world,  ile the thoughts of the in-&#xD;
valid wandered' to the approaching shores of&#xD;
another realm, and she thanked God that,&#xD;
though thick folds of darkness shrouded earth,&#xD;
the veil dropped from her souland the spirit-&#xD;
ual vision grew clear and piercing. If faith&#xD;
and'resignation could be taught like music or&#xD;
arithmetic, then had Electra- learned the&#xD;
grandest truths of Christianity ; but it -is a&#xD;
mourifuhl fact that the bloody seal of Experi-&#xD;
ence must stamp the lesson ere deepthinkers&#xD;
I' or strong natures receive it, and as she watched&#xD;
that precious life fade, like the purple light of&#xD;
&#xD;
summer in evening skies, the only feeling she&#xD;
knew was that of grief for the impending loss&#xD;
-undefined apprehension of coming isolation.&#xD;
If Mrs. Aubrey could have -seen the counte-&#xD;
nance which bent over her pillow, her serene&#xD;
soul , would have been painfully disturbed.&#xD;
She felt hot tears fall on.her hands and cheeks,&#xD;
and knew that the lips which pressed hers of-&#xD;
ten trembled; but this seemed natural enough&#xD;
under the circumstances, and she sank quietly&#xD;
down to the edge of thectomb ignorarnt of the&#xD;
sorrows that racked the girl's heart. One&#xD;
morning when Mr. Campbell, the 'pastor, had-&#xD;
spent some time in the sick-room praying with&#xD;
the sufferer, and administering the sacrament&#xD;
of the Lord's Supper, Electra followed him to&#xD;
th'e door, leaving Russell with 'his mother. The&#xD;
gentld pastor took -her hand kindly, and looked&#xD;
at her with filling eyes.&#xD;
" You think' my aunt is worse ?"&#xD;
" Yes, my child. I think that very soon she&#xD;
will bd with her God. She will scarcely sur-&#xD;
vive till night-"4...&#xD;
She turned abruptly from him, and threw&#xD;
herself down across the foot of the bed, bury-&#xD;
ing her face'in her arms. Russell sat with his&#xD;
mother's hands ip hi's, while she turned her&#xD;
brown eyes toward him and exhorted him to&#xD;
commit hiinself and his future to the hands of&#xD;
a merciful God. She told him how the prom-&#xD;
ises of the Saviour had supported and cheered&#xD;
her in times of great need, and implored him&#xD;
to dedicate his energies, his talents, his life, to&#xD;
the service of his 7Iaker. Electra was not&#xD;
forgotten ; she advised her to go to a cousin of&#xD;
her mother residing in Virginia. Long before&#xD;
she had'.written to this" lady, informing her of&#xD;
her own feebleness and of the girl's helpless&#xD;
condition; and a kind answer had been re-&#xD;
turned, cordially inviting the orphan to share&#xD;
her 'home, to become an inmate of her house.&#xD;
Russell could take her to these relatives as&#xD;
soon as possible. ' To all this no reply was&#xD;
made,'-and, a few moments later, when Russell'&#xD;
kissed her tenderly and raised her pillow, she&#xD;
said faintly-..&#xD;
"IfI could look upon your face once more,&#xD;
my son, it would not be hard to die. Let me&#xD;
see yoti in heaven, my dear, dear boy." These&#xD;
were the last words, and soon after a stupor&#xD;
fell upon her. Hour after hour passed ; Mrs.&#xD;
Campbell came and sat beside the bed, and,&#xD;
the three remained silent, now and then lift-&#xD;
ing bowed heads to look at the sleeper. - Not&#xD;
a sound broke the stillness save the occasional&#xD;
chirp of a cricket, and a shy mouse crept&#xD;
twice across the floor, wondering at the silence,&#xD;
fixing its twinkling bright eyes on the motioti-&#xD;
less 'figures. The autumn day : id slowly as&#xD;
the widow, and when the clock irged out the&#xD;
sunset honi- Russell iose, and, putting back&#xD;
the window-curtains, stooped and laid his face&#xD;
close to his mother's. Life is at best a strug-&#xD;
gle, and such perfect repose as greeted himnis&#xD;
found only when the marble hands of Death&#xD;
&#xD;
MACARIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
transfer the soul to its guardian angel. No&#xD;
pulsation stirred the folds over the heart, or&#xD;
the soft bands of hairion the blue-veined tem-&#xD;
ples; the still mouth had breathed its last sigh,&#xD;
and the meek brown eyes. had opened in&#xD;
Eternity.- The long, fierce ordeal had ended,&#xD;
the flames died out, and, from smouldering&#xD;
ashes the purified spirit that had toiled and&#xD;
fainted not, that had been faithful to the end,&#xD;
patiently bearing many crosses, heard the voice&#xD;
of the Great Shepherd, and soared joyfully to&#xD;
the pearly gates of the Everlasting Home.&#xD;
The day bore her away on its wings, and as&#xD;
Russell touched the icy cheek a despairing cry&#xD;
rolled through the silentcottage-&#xD;
"Oh, Mother! my own precious dead motherI"&#xD;
Falling on his knees, he laid his head on&#xD;
her pillow, and when kind friendly hands bore&#xD;
her intq the adjoining room, he knelt there&#xD;
still, unconscious of what passed, knowing&#xD;
only that the keenest of many blows had fall-&#xD;
en, that the last and bitterest vial of sortows&#xD;
had been emptied.&#xD;
Night folded. her starry curtains around the&#xD;
earth; darkness settled on river and hill and&#xD;
valley. It was late September ; autumn winds&#xD;
rose, eager for their work of death, and rushed&#xD;
rudely through the forests, shaking the sturdy&#xD;
primeval monarchs in. token of their mission&#xD;
and mastery, and shivering leaves rustled&#xD;
down before them, drifting into tiny grave-&#xD;
like hillocks. Gradually the stars caught the&#xD;
contagiousgloom, and shrank behind the cloud=&#xD;
skirts sweeping the cold sky. .It was a sol-&#xD;
emn, melancholy night, full of dreary phan-&#xD;
toms, presaging a dark, dismal morrow.. Amy&#xD;
Aubrey's still form reposed on- the draped&#xD;
table in the kitchen, and the fitful candle-light&#xD;
showed only a dim, rigid outline of white linen.&#xD;
Mr. Campbell and his wife sat together in the&#xD;
next room, and the two young mourners were&#xD;
left in the silence of the-kitchen. , Russell sat&#xD;
at the open window, near the table; his head&#xD;
leaned on his hand, tearless, mute, still as his&#xD;
mother. At the opposite window stood Elec-&#xD;
tra, pressing-her face against the framk, look-&#xD;
ing out into the moaning, struggling night,&#xD;
striving to read the mystic characters dimly&#xD;
traced on the ash-gray hurrying clouds as the&#xD;
reckless winds parted their wan folds. 'The&#xD;
stony face of her merciless destiny seemed to&#xD;
frown down at her, cold, grim, Sphinx-like.&#xD;
Hitherto she had walked with loved ones;&#xD;
now a vast sepulchre yawned to receive them;&#xD;
a tomb of clay for the quiet sleeper, one of&#xD;
perhaps final separation for Russell, and over&#xD;
this last hideous chasm Hope hovered with&#xD;
drooping wings. To leave him was like inurn-&#xD;
ing her heart and all the joy she had ever&#xD;
known; and then, to crown her agony, a&#xD;
thousand Furies hissed " Irene will come back,&#xD;
and loving her .he will forget .that you toil&#xD;
among strangers." -&#xD;
She crushed her fingers against each other&#xD;
and stified.a groan, while the chilling voice of&#xD;
&#xD;
83&#xD;
&#xD;
Destiny added, "Trample out this weakness ;&#xD;
your path and his here separate widely ; you&#xD;
are nothing to him, go to work earnestly, and&#xD;
cease repining." She shrank away from the&#xD;
window and approached her 'cousin. ,3.or two&#xD;
hours he had not changed his position-as far&#xD;
as she knew, had not moved a muscle. She&#xD;
sat down at his feet and crossed her arms over&#xD;
his knees; he took no notice of her.&#xD;
" Oh, Russell ! say something to me, or I&#xD;
shall die."&#xD;
It was the last wail she ever suffered to' es-&#xD;
cape her in.his presence. He raised his head&#xD;
and put his hand on her forehead, but the&#xD;
trembling lips refused their office, and as she&#xD;
looked up at him tears rolled.slowly down and&#xD;
fell on her cheek. She would have given&#xD;
worlds to mingle her tears with his, but no&#xD;
moisture came to her burning eyes; and there&#xD;
these two, so soon to separate, passed the re-&#xD;
maining hours of that long, wretched night of .&#xD;
watching. The stormy day lifted her pale,&#xD;
mournful face at last, -and with 'it came the&#xD;
dreary. patter and sobbingof autumn, rain,&#xD;
making it doubly harrowing to commit the&#xD;
precious form to its long, last resting-place.&#xD;
Electra stood up beside her cousin and folded&#xD;
her arms together.&#xD;
" Russell, I am not going to that cousin in&#xD;
Virginia. I could owe my bread and clothes&#xD;
to you, but not to her. She has children, and&#xD;
I do not intend to 'live on her charity. I know&#xD;
you and I must part ; the sooner the better. I&#xD;
would not be willing to burden you, a day&#xD;
longer. I am going to fit myself to work'prof.&#xD;
itably. Mr. Clifton offered me a home in his&#xD;
house, said his mother was lonely, and would&#xD;
be rejoiced to have me ; that letter which I&#xD;
received last week contained one from her,&#xD;
also urging me to come; and, Russell, I am&#xD;
going to New York to stud with him as long&#xD;
as I need instruction. I did not tell aunt of&#xD;
this, because I knew it would grieve her to&#xD;
think that I would be thrown with strangers;&#xD;
and having fully determined to take this step,&#xD;
thought it best not to distress her by any al-&#xD;
lusion to it. You' know  it is my own affair,&#xD;
.and I can decide -it-better than' any one else."&#xD;
His eyes were fixed on the shrouded table,&#xD;
and he answered without ookino at her'.&#xD;

"I can not leave it with anybody ; I must&#xD;

deal about it, and my resolutions not to be&#xD;
shaken.  You have been very kind to me,&#xD;

watn  ithd~solate cttae eAt midnight&#xD;
a heavy sleep fell on Russell, who had thrown&#xD;
&#xD;
himself upon his mother's couch,; and, softly&#xD;
spreading a shawl over him, Electra sat down&#xD;
by the dying fire on the kitchen-hearth and&#xD;
looked her' future in the face. A few days&#xD;
sufficed to prepare for her journey ; and a gen-&#xD;
tl-bman from New York, who had met her&#xD;
cousin in Mr. Campbell's office, consented to&#xD;
take charge of her and commit her to Mr.&#xD;
Clifton's hands.. The scanty furniture was&#xD;
sent to an auction-room, and a piece of board&#xD;
nailed to the gate-post, announced thatkthe&#xD;
cottage was for rent. Russell decided to take&#xD;
his meals at a boarding-house, and occupy a&#xD;
small room over the office, which Mr. Camp-&#xD;
bell had placed at his disposal. On the same&#xD;
day the cousins bade adieu to the only spot&#xD;
they had called homem" for many years, and&#xD;
as Russell locked the door and joined Electra&#xD;
his melancholy face expressed, ar bet,.er than&#xD;
words could have done, the pain it cost him to&#xD;
quit the house where his idolized mother had&#xD;
lived; suffered, and died. Mr. Colton was&#xD;
waiting for Electra at the hotel, whither the&#xD;
stage had been driven for passengers; and as&#xD;
she drew near and saw her trunk among others,&#xD;
piled on top, she stopped and grasped Russell's&#xD;
hand between both hers. A livid paleness&#xD;
settled on her face, while her wild black eyes&#xD;
fastened on his features. .She might never&#xD;
see him again; he was far dearer to her than&#xD;
her life ; how could she bear', to leave him, to&#xD;
put hundreds of miles between that- face and&#xD;
her own ? An icy hand clutched her heart as&#xD;
she gazed into his deep, sad, beautiful eyes.&#xD;
His feeling for her was a steady, serene affec-&#xD;
tion, such as brothers have for dear young sis-&#xD;
ters, and to give her up now filled him with&#xD;
genuine, earnest sorrow.&#xD;
"Electra; it is very hard to tell you good-&#xD;
b    You are all Irhave left, and 1 shall be&#xD;
desolate indeed when you are away. But&#xD;
the separation will not be long, I trust; in a&#xD;
few years we shall be able to have another&#xD;
home; and where my home is, yours must&#xD;
always be.  Til stretches before me like a&#xD;
sandy desert, but I shall cross it safely; and&#xD;
then, Electra, my dear cousin, we shall' be&#xD;
parted no more. I should feel far better sat-&#xD;
isfied if you were with Mrs. Harden, but you&#xD;
determined otherwise, and, as you told me a&#xD;
few, days ago, I have no right to control you.&#xD;
Write to me often, and believe that I shall do'&#xD;
all that a brother could for you. Mr. Colton&#xD;
is waiting; good-by, darling."&#xD;
He bent down to kiss her, and the strained,&#xD;
tortured look that greeted him he never for-&#xD;
got. She put her arms around his neck, and&#xD;

rough winds against a stone wall. He re-&#xD;

into the stage she drew back, that Russell&#xD;
might perform that office. While he almost&#xD;
lifted her to a seat, her' fingers refused to&#xD;
release hi, and he was fred to disengage&#xD;
&#xD;
them. Other passenge rs entered, and the door&#xD;
was, osed. IRussell stood near the window,&#xD;
and saidgently, pitying her suffering:&#xD;
"4,Electra, won't you say good-by ?"&#xD;
She leaned out, till her cheek touched his,&#xD;
and in a 'hoarse tone uttered the fluttering&#xD;
words :&#xD;
" Oh, Russell ! Russell ! good-by!t May God&#xD;
have mercy on me "&#xD;
And the stage rolled swiftly on; men laugh-&#xD;
ed, talked, and smoked; an October sun filled&#xD;
the sky with glory, and gilded the trees on the&#xD;
roadside; flame-colored leaves flashed in the&#xD;
air as the wind tossed them before it; the deep,&#xD;
continual thunder of the foaming falls rose&#xD;
soothingly from the river banks, andea wretch-&#xD;
ed human thing pressed her bloodless face&#xD;
against the morocco lining of the coach and&#xD;
stared down, mute and tearless, into the wide&#xD;
grave of her all-nd&#xD;
" Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,&#xD;

CHAPTER VIIL&#xD;
As tall tyrannous weeds and rank unshorn&#xD;
grass close over and crush out slender, pure,&#xD;
odorous flowerets on a hill-side, so the defects&#xD;
of Irene's character swiftly strengthened and&#xD;
developed in the new atmosphere in which&#xD;
she found herself. All the fostering stimulus&#xD;
of a hot-bedseemed applied to themend her&#xD;
nobler impulses were in imminent danger of&#xD;
being entirely subdued.nDiogenes Teufels-&#xD;
aSeminary" is but the prototype of hundreds,&#xD;
scattered up and down through Christendom;&#xD;
and the associations which surrounded Irene&#xD;
were well circulated to destroy the native&#xD;
purity and unselfishness of her nature. The&#xD;
school was on an extensive scale, thoroughly&#xD;
fashionable,'and thither pupils were sent from&#xD;
every section of the United States. As re-&#xD;
garded educational advantages, the institution&#xD;
was unexceptionable; the professors wercon-i&#xD;
sidered unsurpassed i  their several depart-Y&#xD;
mnt, and every provision was made for i&#xD;
thorough tuition. But what a Babel reigned&#xD;
outside of the recitation-room. One hundred&#xD;
and forty girls to spend their recesses in envy,r&#xD;
ridicule, malice, and detraction. The homely e&#xD;
squad  banded  in  implacable  hatred  against s w om n ur ha c st i mul s f a&#xD;
beauty  ;  the  indolent  and  obtuse  ever  so  h l it  o dor he uc s fu efo t  o their '&#xD;
&#xD;
intdllec as the casepmisht be-growing more&#xD;
arrogant and insufferaIe day by day. A&#xD;
wretched climate this fora fresh, untainted&#xD;
soul ; and it is surprising how really fon'd'&#xD;
parents, anxious to, promote' the improvement&#xD;
of their daughters in aeveryrespect, hasten to&#xD;
place them where poisonous vapors wrea~the&#xD;
and- curl about them. The principals of such&#xD;
institutions are doubtless often conscientious,&#xD;
aiid strive to 'diseharfe their duty faithfully,;&#xD;
bot the evils of human nature, are obstinate,&#xD;
difficult to-subdue under even the most favor-&#xD;
able auspices; and where such a mass of un-&#xD;
trained souls are turned into an enclosure, to&#xD;
amuse themselves at one another's expense,&#xD;
mischief is sure to -follow. Anxious to shake'&#xD;
off the loneliness which so heavily oppressed&#xD;
her, Irene 'at first mingled freely among her&#xD;
companions ; but.she soon became disgusted&#xD;
with the conduct and opinions of the majority,&#xD;
and endeavored to find quiet in her owr room.&#xD;
Maria Ashley, who shared the apartmcnt,was&#xD;
the spoiled child of a Louisiana planter, and&#xD;
her views of life and duty were too utterly&#xD;
antagonistic to Irene's to allow of any pleasure&#xD;
in each other's(society. .'To cheat the profess.&#xD;
sorts by ingenious stratagems, and to out-dress&#xD;
her companions, seemed the sum total of the&#xD;
girl's aspirations; and gradually in lieu of the&#xD;
indifference she. evinced toward her room-&#xD;
mate, a positive hatred made itself apparent&#xD;
in numberless trifles. Feeling her own supe-&#xD;
riority, Irene held herself more and more&#xD;
aloof; her self-complacency grew amazingly,&#xD;
the graceful figure took a haughty, unbending&#xD;
posture, and a coldly contemptuous 'smile&#xD;
throned itself on her lip. The inevitable con-&#xD;
sequence, was, that she became a target for&#xD;
the school. Thus the months crept away ; her&#xD;
father wrote rarely, and Miss Margaret's let-&#xD;
ters contained no allusion to the family that&#xD;
had caused her banishment. 'Finally 'she&#xD;
wrote to Dr., Arnold, inquiring concerning'&#xD;
Mrs. Aubrey, but no reply reached her.Early&#xD;
in winter a new pupil, a "day scholar," joined&#xD;
her class; she resided in New York, and-very&#xD;
soon a strong friendship sprang up between&#xD;
them. 'Louisa Young was about Irene's age,&#xD;
very pretty, very gentle and winning -in her&#xD;
manners. She was the daughter of-an affluent&#xD;
merchant, and was blessed i4thepossessionp9f&#xD;
parents who strove to rear their children as&#xD;
Christian parents should. 'Louisa's attach.&#xD;
ments were very warm and lasting, and ere&#xD;
ong she insisted that her friend-should visit&#xD;
her., Weary of the school, the ,latter gladly&#xD;
availed herself of the-invitation, and one Fri.&#xD;
day afternoon, she accompanied Louisa home.&#xD;
The mansion was almost palatialand as Irene&#xD;
Entered 'the splendidly-furnishedparlors her&#xD;
~wn Southern home rose vividly before her.&#xD;
"Mother,'this is Miss Huntingdon."&#xD;
Mrs. Young received her cordially, and' as&#xD;

In  Louisa's beautiful room the two sat talk-&#xD;
ing of various things till the tea-bell rang.&#xD;
Mi. Young's greeting was scarcely less friendly&#xD;
than his wife s, and as they seated themselves&#xD;
at the table the stranger felt at home for the&#xD;
first time in vew York.&#xD;
"Where is Brother?" asked Louisa, glancing&#xD;
at the vacant seat opposite her own.&#xD;
t "He has not come home yet; I wonder what&#xD;
keeps him?   There he is now, in the hall,"&#xD;
answered the mother.&#xD;
Moment after he entered and took his&#xD;
seat. He was tall, rather handsome, and look-&#xD;
ed about thirty. His sister presented her&#xD;
friend, and with a hasty 'bow he fastened his&#xD;
eyes on her face. Probably he was uncon-&#xD;
scious of the steadiness of his gaze, but Irene&#xD;
became restless under his fixed, earnest eye,&#xD;
and, perceiving  her embarrassment, Mrs.&#xD;
Young said-b.&#xD;
" Harvey, where have you been? Dr., Mel-&#xD;
ville called here for you at four o'-lock; said&#xD;
you had made some engagement withi him."&#xD;
"Yes, Mother ; we have been visiting to-&#xD;
gether this afternoon."&#xD;
Withdrawing his eyes, he seemed to fall&#xD;
into a reverie, and took no part in the conver-&#xD;
sation that ensued. As the party adjourned&#xD;
'to the sitting'-room he paused on the rug and&#xD;
leaned his efbow on the mantle. Louisa lin-&#xD;
gered, and drew near. He passed his arm&#xD;
around her shoulders and looked affectionately&#xD;
down at her.&#xD;
" well, what is it ?"&#xD;
"Come into the sitting-room and help me&#xD;
entertain Irene, instead 'of going off to your&#xD;
stpd stdy do, Harvey."&#xD;
stu   stu"A very reasonable request, truly ! I must&#xD;
quit my work to talk to one of your school-&#xD;
mates; nonsense I How old is she ?"&#xD;
"Fifteen. Is not she a beauty ?"&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
"1Oh, Harvey!I you are so cold I I thought&#xD;
youwould admire Irene prodigiously ; and&#xD;
now you say 'yes' just exactly as if I had&#xD;
asked you whether it was snowing out of&#xD;
doors."     I&#xD;
"Which is certainly the fact ; the first&#xD;
flakes fell as I reached home."&#xD;
lIe stepped to the window and looked out,&#xD;
saying carelessly-&#xD;
"Go to your friend, and when you are at a&#xD;
loss for conversation, bring her to my study to&#xD;
see those-sktches of Palmyra and Baalbec."&#xD;
He passed on to his, work and she to the&#xD;
sitting-room.s The study was simply the&#xD;
library handsomely fitted up with choice old&#xD;
books in rijhly-carved rosewood cases,~,and&#xD;

chair sat before the glowing coal-fire. The&#xD;
table was covered with books and loose sheets&#xD;
of paper wei-e scattered around, as if the oc-&#xD;
cupant had been suddenly called from   his&#xD;
labor. The gas burned brightly ; all things&#xD;
beckoned back to work. He sat down,&#xD;
glanced over the half-written sheets, numbered&#xD;
the pages, laid them away in the drawer, and&#xD;
opened a volume of St. Chrysostom. As the&#xD;
light fell on his, countenance it was very&#xD;
apparent that he had been a student for years;,&#xD;
that his mind was habituated to patient, labo-&#xD;
rious investigation. 'Gravity, utterly free from&#xD;
sorrow or sternness, marked his face ; he might&#xD;
have passed all his days in that quiet room,&#xD;
for 'any impress which the cares or joys of out-&#xD;
door life had left on his features ; a strong, clear&#xD;
intellect; a lofty, earnest soul; a calm, unruffled&#xD;
heart, that knew not half its own unsounded&#xD;
abysses. He read industriously for some time,&#xD;
occasionally pausing to annotate ; and once&#xD;
or twice he raised his head and listenedifan-&#xD;
cying footsteps in the hall. Finally he pushed&#xD;
the book away, took a turn across the floor,&#xD;
and resumed his seat. He could not rivet his&#xD;
attention on St. Chrysostom, and, folding his&#xD;
arms over his chest, he studied the red coals&#xD;
instead. Soon after, unmistakable steps fell&#xD;
on his ear, and a light tap at the door was&#xD;
followed by the entrance of the two girls.&#xD;
Irene came very reluctantly, fearful of intrud-&#xD;
ing ; but he rose, and placed' a chair for her&#xD;
close tohis own, assuring her that he was glad&#xD;
to see her there. Louisa found the portfolio,&#xD;
and, bringing it to the table, began to exhibit&#xD;
its treasures. The two leaned over it, and as&#xD;
Irene sat resting her cheek on her hand, the&#xD;
beauty of her face, and figure was clearly re-&#xD;
vealed. Harvey remained silent, watching&#xD;
the changing expression of the visitor's couu-&#xD;
tenance ; and once he put out his haiyl to&#xD;
touch the hair floating over the back and arms&#xD;
of her chair. Gradually his still heart stirred,&#xD;
his brow flushed, and a new light burned in the'&#xD;
deep clear eyes.&#xD;
" Louisa, where did you get these ?"&#xD;
" roth'er brought them home when he came&#xD;
from the East."&#xD;
Irene lifted her eyes to his and said:&#xD;
" Did you visit all these places? Did you&#xD;
go to that crumbling Temple of the Sun?"&#xD;
He-told her of his visit to the Old World, of&#xD;
its mournful ruins, its decaying glories: of the&#xD;
lessons he learned there; the 'sad but precious&#xD;
memories he brought back ; and as h8 talked&#xD;
time passed unheeded-she forgot her embar-&#xD;
rassment; they were strangers no longer. -The&#xD;
clock struck ten ; Louisa rose at once.&#xD;
" Thank you, Harvey, for giving us so much&#xD;
of your time. Father and; Mother will be&#xD;
waiting for you."&#xD;
." Yes, I will join you at once.&#xD;
She led the way back to the sitting-room,&#xD;

the room was dim, she knew the tall form and&#xD;
the touch of his hand.&#xD;
"Good-evening, Miss Irene; we "have had&#xD;
a -gloomy day. How have you and Louisa&#xD;
spent it?"                              .&#xD;
"Not very profitably I dare say, though it has&#xD;
not appeared at all gloomy to me. Have you&#xD;
been out in the snow ?"&#xD;
"Yes; my work has been sad. I buried a&#xD;
mother and child this afternoon, and have just&#xD;
come from house of orphanage and grief. It&#xD;
is a difficult matter to realize how many ach-&#xD;
ipg hearts there are in this great city. Our&#xD;
mahogany doors shut out the wail that hourly&#xD;
goes:up to God from the thousand sufferers in&#xD;
our midst."A&#xD;
Just.then a servant lighted the chandelier,&#xD;
and she saw that he, loo ed graver than ever.&#xD;
Louisa came up and put her arms around'his&#xD;
neck, but he did not return the caress; said a&#xD;
few kind words, and rising, slowly paced the&#xD;
floor. As his eye fell on the piano he paused,&#xD;
saying, " Come; Louisa, sing that song for&#xD;
me,"    -&#xD;
She sat 'down and began, " Comfort ye my&#xD;
people ;" aid gradually the sadness melted&#xD;
from his features. As Irene listened to the&#xD;
f solemn strains she found it difficult to control&#xD;
her feelings, and by degrees her head sank&#xD;
until it touched the arm of the sofa. The&#xD;
minister watched the effect of the music, and,&#xD;
resuming his seat, said gently :&#xD;
"It is genuine philosophy to extract com-&#xD;
cm fort and aid from every possible source. There&#xD;
is a vast amount of strength needed to combat&#xD;
the evils and trials which necessarily occur in&#xD;
even the, sunniest, happiest lives; and I find&#xD;
that sometimes I derive far. more from a song&#xD;
-than a lengthy sermon. We are curious bits&#xD;
of mechanism, and frequently music effects&#xD;
what learned disputation,or earnest exhorta-&#xD;
tion could not accomplish. I remember once,&#xD;
when I was a -child, fhad given my mother a&#xD;
great deal of trouble by my obstinacy. She&#xD;
had entreated me, reasoned with me, and&#xD;
finally punished me, but all to no purpose ;&#xD;
my wickedness had not been conquered. I&#xD;
was bitter and rebellious, and continued so all&#xD;
day. That evening she sat down to the piano&#xD;
and sang a hymu for my father. The-instant&#xD;
the strains fell on  my ear I felt softened, crept&#xD;
down stairs to the parlor-door, and before she&#xD;
had finished was crying heartily,-begging her&#xD;
forgiveness. When a sublime air is made the&#xD;
vehicle of a noble sentiment there is no com-&#xD;
puting the amount of good it accomplishes, if&#xD;
p roperlydirected. During my visit to Lon-&#xD;
dnrwent to hear a very celebrated divine.&#xD;
I had just lost a dear friend, the companion&#xD;
who travelled with me to Jerusalem and.Me-&#xD;
roe, and I went to church full of sorrow. The&#xD;
sermon washable, but had no more effect in&#xD;
comforting me than if X had not listened to it.&#xD;
He preached from that text of/Job treating&#xD;
Ii of the resurrection, and at' the conclusion the&#xD;
&#xD;
very words of his text, ' know that my Re-&#xD;
deemer liveth,' were sung y the choir. Whlen&#xD;
the organ rolled its solemn tones under the&#xD;
dim arched roof, and I heard the voices of the&#xD;
choir swelling deep and full-&#xD;
. Throb tirougi the ribbed stone,'&#xD;
then,. and not till then, I appreciated the&#xD;
grand words to which I had listened. The&#xD;
organ spoke to my soul hs man could not,'and&#xD;
I left the church calmed and comforted. All&#xD;
things are capable of yielding benefit, if prop-&#xD;
erly applied, though it is a lamentable truth&#xD;
that gross abuse has involved many possible&#xD;
sources of good in disrepute; andit is .our&#xD;
duty to extract elevating influences from all&#xD;
departments. Such an alchemy is especially&#xD;
the privilege of a Christian."       '''&#xD;
As he talked she lifted her beautiful eyes&#xD;
and looked steadily at him, 'and he thought&#xD;
that, of all the lovely things he had ever seen,&#xD;
that face was the most peerless. She drew&#xD;
closer to him, and said earnestly:&#xD;
"Then you ought to be happy, Mr. Young."&#xD;
" That implies a doubt that am."&#xD;
"You -do not seem to me a very happy&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"There you mistake ne. I presume there&#xD;
are few happier persons."&#xD;
" Countenance is not a faithful index, then;&#xD;
you look so exceedingly grave."    .&#xD;
"Do you suppose that gravity of face is in-&#xD;
compatible"with sunshine in the heart ?" ~&#xD;
" I think it reasonable that'the sunshine&#xD;
should sprkle in the eyes and gleam Aver the&#xD;
features. But, sir, I should like, if you please,&#xD;
to talk to you a little about other things. May&#xD;
I ?"                         '-&#xD;
" Certainly ; speak on, and speak freely;&#xD;
you may trust me, I think."&#xD;
He smiled.encouragingly as he spoke, and.&#xD;
without a moment's thought she laid her deli-&#xD;
cate hand in his.-&#xD;
"Mr. Young, I want somebody to advise&#xD;
me. Very often I am at a loss about my duty,_&#xD;
and, having no one to consult, either do noth-&#xD;
in" at all, or that whiph I should not. If it&#xD;
wil not trouble you too much, I should like to&#xD;
bring my difficulties to you sometimes, and&#xD;
get you to direct me. If you will only- talk&#xD;
frankly to me, as you do to Louisa, oh ! I will&#xD;
be very grateful."&#xD;
He folded his hands softly over the white,&#xD;
fluttering fingers.&#xD;
" Louisa is my sister, and therefore I do not&#xD;
hesitate to-tell her unwelcome truths. But you&#xD;
happento be a perfect stranger,and might not&#xD;
relish my counsel."&#xD;
"Try me." ,&#xD;

89&#xD;
&#xD;
"You would like a bother, however ?"&#xD;
"Yes sir, above all things."&#xD;
" Take care; you express yourself strongly.&#xD;
If you can "fancy me or a brother, consider&#xD;
me such. One thing I can promise-you-will&#xD;
have a guardian sleepless as Ladon, and un-&#xD;
tiring in his efforts to aid you as if he were in&#xD;
truth a A3riareus. If you are not afraid of&#xD;
espionage, make me your brother. What say&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
",I am not 'afraid, sir. I believe I need&#xD;
watching .'-&#xD;
"Ah, that you do1" he exclaimed, with un-&#xD;
usual emphasis.&#xD;
"He can-be very stern, Irene, gentle as he&#xD;
looks," suggested Louisa.&#xD;
"If he never found fault with me I should&#xD;
not need his friendship."&#xD;
When Monday morning came, and she was&#xD;
obliged to "return to school, Irene reluctantly&#xD;
bade farewell to the new friends. She knew&#xD;
that, in conformity to the unalterable regula-&#xD;
tion of Crim Tartary, she could only leave the&#xD;
institution oiee a month, and the prospect of&#xD;
this long interval between her visits was by&#xD;
no means cheering. Harvey assisted her into&#xD;
the carriage.&#xD;
" I shall send you some books in a day or&#xD;
two,, and if you are troubled about anything&#xD;
before I see you again, write me a note by&#xD;
Louisa. I. would call to see you occasionally&#xD;
if you were boarding anywhere else. Good-&#xD;
morning, Miss Irene ; do not forget that.I am&#xD;
your brother .so long as you stay in New York,&#xD;
or need one."&#xD;
The books were not forgotten ; they arrived&#xD;
the ensuing week, and his selection satisfied&#xD;
her that he perfectly understood what kind of&#xD;
aid she required. Her visit made'a lasting im-&#xD;
pression on her mind, and the Sabbath spept&#xD;
in Louisa's home often recurred to her in after&#xD;
years, as the memory of some green, sunny&#xD;
isle of rest haunts the dreams of weary, tem-&#xD;
pest-lashed mariners in a roaring sea. Maria&#xD;
Ashley was a sore trial of patience, and occa-&#xD;
sionally, after a fruitless struggle to rise above&#xD;
the temptations presented almost hourly, Irene&#xD;
looked longingly toward Louisa's fireside, as&#xD;
one turns to the last source of support. Fi-&#xD;
nally she took refuge in silence, and, except&#xD;
when compelled to do so, rarely commented&#xD;
upon anything that occurred. The days were&#xD;
always busy, and when the text-books were&#xD;
finished she ,had, recourse to those supplied&#xD;
by her new friends. At the close of the next&#xD;
month, instead of accompanying Louisa home,&#xD;
Irene was suffering with severe cold, and too&#xD;
much indisposed to quit the house. This was&#xD;
. a grievous disappointment, but she bore it&#xD;
bravely and went on with her studies. What&#xD;
a dreary' isolation in the midst 'of numbers of&#xD;
her own age. It was a thraldom that g'alled&#xD;
. her; and more than once she implored her&#xD;
father's permission to return home. His re-&#xD;
plies were positive denials, and after a time&#xD;
&#xD;
88&#xD;
&#xD;
she ceased to expect release until the pre-&#xD;
sci-ibed course should be ended. Thus an-&#xD;
other month dragged itself away. On Friday&#xD;
morning Louisa was absent. Irene felt anx-&#xD;
ious AnYdistressed ; perhaps she was ill; 'some.&#xD;
thing must have happened. As the day-pupils&#xD;
were dismissed she started back to her, own&#xD;
room, heart-sick because of this second disap-&#xD;
pointment. "After all," thought she, "I may&#xD;
as well accustom myself to being ,one. Of&#xD;
course 1 can't hove the Youngs always." I&#xD;
must learn to deperid on myself. She put&#xD;
away the bonnet and cloak laid out in readi-&#xD;
ness for departure, and sat down to wiite to&#xD;
her Aunt Margaret. A few minutes after a&#xD;
servant knocked at the door aid informed her&#xD;
that a gentleman wished to see her in the&#xD;
parlor.&#xD;
CHAPTERR VI I&#xD;
" I am so glad to see you, Mr., Young.&#xD;
Louisa is not sick, I hope ?"&#xD;
"I came for you in Louisa's 'place ; she is&#xD;
not well enough to quit her 'room. Did you&#xD;
suppose that I intended leaving you here for&#xD;
another month ?"&#xD;
"I was rather afraid you had forgotten me;&#xD;
the prospect *as gloomy-ten minutes ago. It&#xD;
seems a long time since I was with you."&#xD;
She stood close to him, looking gladly into&#xD;
his face, unconscious of the effect ofer words.&#xD;
"You sent me no note all this time ; why&#xD;
not ?"&#xD;
"I was afraid of troubling you; and, be-&#xD;
sides, I would rather tell you. what I want you&#xD;
to know."&#xD;
"Miss Irene, the carriage is at the door.- I&#xD;
am a patient man, and can wait half an hour&#xD;
if you have any preparation to make."&#xD;
In much less time she joined him, equipped&#xD;
for the ride, and took her place beside him in&#xD;
the carriage. As they reached his -father's&#xD;
door, and he assisted her out, she saw him&#xD;
lopk at her very searchingly.&#xD;
" It is time that you had a little fresh air.&#xD;
You are not quite yourself. Louisa is in her&#xD;
room; run up to her."&#xD;
She found her friend suffering with sore&#xD;
throat, and was startled at the appearance of&#xD;
her flushed cheeks. Mrs. Young sat beside&#xD;
her, and after most cordial greetings the.latter&#xD;
resigned 'her seat and left them, enjoining&#xD;
upon her daughter the necessity of remaining&#xD;
quiet.afadfroj&#xD;
" Mother was almost afraid for yo   come,&#xD;
but I teased and coaxed for permission; told&#xD;
her that even if I had scarlet-fever, your had&#xD;
already had it, and would run no risk., Har-&#xD;
vey says it is not acarlet-fever at all, and he&#xD;
prsuaded mother to 'let him go after you.&#xD;
Halashas things his own way, though he&#xD;
brings it about so, quietly that nobody would&#xD;
ever suspect him of being self-willed. Hiar-&#xD;

,,was none to help, and I wondered that there&#xD;
was none to uphold ; therefore mine own arm&#xD;
brought salvation unto me.' Miss Irene, you,&#xD;
too, must ' tread the wine-press alone."'&#xD;
She held her breath and looked "up at him;'&#xD;
the solemn emphasis of his words 'startled her ;&#xD;
they fell upon her weighty as prophecy, adum-&#xD;
brating weary years of ceaseless struggling.&#xD;
The fire-light glowed on her sculptured feat-&#xD;
ures, and he saw an expression of vague&#xD;
dread in her glance.&#xD;
"Miss Irene, yours is not a clinging, de-&#xD;
pendent disposition ; if I have have rightly un-&#xD;
derstood your character, you have never been&#xD;
accustomed to lean upon others. After rely-&#xD;
ing on yourself so long, why yield to mistrust&#xD;
now ? With -years should grow the power,&#xD;
the determination, to do the work you find.&#xD;
laid out for you."  '&#xD;
"It is precisely because I know how very&#xD;
poorly I have managed myself thus far, that I&#xD;
have no confidence in my own powers for fu-&#xD;
ture emergencies. Either I have lived alone&#xD;
too long,, or else not long enough ;i rather&#xD;
think the last. If they had 'only suffered me&#xD;
to act as I wished, I should have been so much&#xD;
better at home. Oh, sir ! I am not the girl I&#xD;
was eight months ago. I knew how it would&#xD;
be when they sent me here."&#xD;
Resting her chin in her hands, she.,gazed&#xD;
sadly into the grate, and saw, amid glowing&#xD;
coals, the walls of the vine-clad cottage, -the.&#xD;
gentle face of the blind woman groping her&#xD;
way, the melancholy eyes of one inexpressibly&#xD;
dear to her.&#xD;
" We can not always live secluded, and at&#xD;
some period of your life you would have been&#xD;
forced to enter the- world and combat its&#xD;
troubles, even had you never seen New York.&#xD;
It is comparatively'easy for anchorites to pre-&#xD;
serve a passionless, equable temperament; but&#xD;
to ignore the very circumstances'and relations&#xD;
of social existence in which God intended that&#xD;
we should be purified and ennobled by trial, is&#xD;
both sinful and cowardly."&#xD;
Taking a small volume from the table, he&#xD;
read impressively:&#xD;
"   tare we set on earth for? Say to toil;&#xD;
Nor seek to leave thy tending of the vines,&#xD;
For all the heat o' the day, till it declines,&#xD;
And death's mild curfew shall from work assail.&#xD;
God did anoint thee with his odorous oil,&#xD;
To wrestle, not to reign. s -o others shall&#xD;
Take patience, labor, to their heart and hand,&#xD;
From thy hand, and thy hart, and thy brave cheer,&#xD;
And God's grace fructify through theeto all."&#xD;
"Some portentous cloud- seems lowering&#xD;
over your future. 'What is it? You ought to&#xD;
be a gleeful girl, full of happy hopes."&#xD;
She sank .farther back ai her chair to es-&#xD;
cape his searching gaze, and drooped her face&#xD;
lower. . '&#xD;
"Yes, yes; I know I ought, but one can't&#xD;
always shut their eyes." -&#xD;
" Shut their eyes to what ?" -&#xD;
&#xD;
41&#xD;
&#xD;
" Various coming troubles, Mr. Young."&#xD;
.His lip curled slightly, and, replacing the&#xD;
book on the table, he said, as if speaking&#xD;
rather to himself than to her:&#xD;
"' The heart knoweth his own bitterness,-&#xD;
and a stranger doth not internieddle with' his&#xD;
joy.' "&#xD;
" Yqu are not a.stranger, sir.&#xD;
" I see -you are disposed to consider me such.&#xD;
I thought I was your brother. But no matter ;&#xD;
after a time all will be well."&#xD;
She looked puzzled ; and, as the tel-bell&#xD;
summoned them, he' merely added:&#xD;
"I do not wonder. You are a aby child ;&#xD;
but you will soon learn to understand me ; you&#xD;
will come to me with all your sorrows."&#xD;
During the remainder of this visit she saw&#xD;
him no more. Louisa recovered rapidly, and&#xD;
when she asked for her brother on Sabbath&#xD;
evening,. Mrs. Young said he was to preach&#xD;
twice that day. Monday morning arrived,&#xD;
and Irene returned to school with a heavy&#xD;
heart, fearing that she had wounded him; but&#xD;
a few days after Louisa brought her a book&#xD;
and brief note of kind words.. About this&#xD;
time she noticed in her letters from home allu-&#xD;
sions to her own future lot, which increased&#xD;
her uneasiness. It was very palpable that her&#xD;
father expected her to accede to his wislkes&#xD;
regarding. a union with her cousin;. and she&#xD;
knew only too well how fierce was the contest&#xD;
before her. Hugh wrote kindly, affectionate-&#xD;
ly; and if she could have divested her mind&#xD;
of this apprehension, his letters would lave&#xD;
comforted her. Thus situated, she turned to&#xD;
her books with redoubled zest, and her natu-&#xD;
rally fine intellect was taxed- to the utmost.&#xD;
Her well-earned pre-eminence in her classes&#xD;
increased the jealousy, the dislike, and censo-&#xD;
riousness of her less -studious comppanions.&#xD;
Months passed ; and though she preserved a&#xD;
calm, impenetrable exterior, taking no heed'&#xD;
of sneers and constant persecution, yet the&#xD;
worm gnawed its slow way, and the plague-&#xD;
spot spread in that'whilom pure spirit. One&#xD;
Saturday morning she sat quite alone in her&#xD;
small room; the week had been specially pain-&#xD;
ful, and, wearied in soul,-thegirl laid her head&#xD;
down on her folded arms and thought of her&#xD;
home in the far South. Thespicf fragrance&#xD;
of orange and magnolia came to her,: and&#xD;
Erebus and Paragon haunted her recollection.&#xD;
Oh ! for one ride through the old pine-woods.&#xD;
Oh! for one look at the water-lilies being&#xD;
obver the creek.Only one wretched year had&#xD;
passedl--how could she endurethose which were&#xD;
to come. A loud, tap'startled, her from this&#xD;
painful reverie, and, ere she could utter the&#xD;
stereotyped "come n," Louisa sprang to her&#xD;
side.&#xD;
"I have come for you, Irene ; have obtained,&#xD;
permission from Dr.       for you to accom-&#xD;
pany us to tfi Academy of Design." Pit 'on&#xD;

" Ah, Louisa! you are all very kind to rec-&#xD;
ollect me so constantly. It will give me great&#xD;
pleasure to go" &#xD;
When they joined the mister Irene fancied&#xD;
lze received. her coldly, and as they walked on&#xD;
he took no part inthe conversation., The an,&#xD;
xiual exhibition had just opened; the rooms&#xD;
were thronged with visitors, and the hifshed&#xD;
tones. swelled to a monotonous hum. Some&#xD;
stood in groups, expatiating eagerly on certain&#xD;
ictures; others occupied ,e seats and leisure-&#xD;
yscanned now the paint s, now the crowd.&#xD;
Furnished with a catalog, the girls moved&#xD;
slowly on, while Mr. Young pointed out the&#xD;
prominent beauties or defects of the works&#xD;
exhibited. They made the circuit of the room,&#xD;
and began a second tour, when their attention&#xD;
was attracted by agirl who stood in one corner,&#xD;
with her hands clasped behind her. .She was&#xD;
gaming very intently on an Ecce-flomo, and,&#xD;
though her face was turned toward the wall,&#xD;
the -posture . bespoke most unusual interest.&#xD;
She was dressed i black, and, having remov-&#xD;
ed 'her straw hat, the rippling jetty hair, cut&#xD;
short like a boy's, glistened in the mellow light.&#xD;
Irene looked at her an instant, and held her&#xD;
breath; she had seen only, one -other head&#xD;
which resembled that-she knew the purplish&#xD;
waving hair. "What is the matter ?" asked&#xD;
the.minister, noting the change-in her coun-&#xD;
tenance. She made no answer, but leaned&#xD;
forward to catch a glimpse of the face. Just&#xD;
then the black figure moved slightly; she saw,&#xD;
the profile, the beautiful straight nose, the&#xD;
arched brow, the clear olive cheek; and glid-&#xD;
ing up to her she exclaimed:&#xD;
"Electra! Electra Grey "&#xD;
The orphan turned, and they were locked&#xD;
in a tight embrace.&#xD;
"Oh,Irie ! I'am so glad to see you. I have&#xD;
been here so long, and looked for you so often,&#xD;
that I had almost despaired. Whenever I&#xD;
walk down Broadway, wheneve- I go out any&#xD;
where, I look at every face, peep into every&#xD;
bonnet, hoping, to find you. Oh ! I am ao&#xD;
glad."&#xD;
Joy flushed the cheeks and fired the deep&#xD;
eyes, and people turned from the canvas on&#xD;
the walls to gaze upon two faces surpassing in&#xD;
beauty aught that the Academy contained.&#xD;
"But what tare you- doing in New York,&#xD;
Electra? Is Russell with you?  How long&#xD;
have you been here?".&#xD;
"Since October last. Russell is at home ;&#xD;
no, he has no home, now. When my aunt'&#xD;
died we separated; I came on to study under&#xD;
Mr. Clifton's care. Have you not heard of&#xD;
our loss ?"&#xD;
t "I have been able to hear nothing of you.&#xD;
I wrote to Dr. Arnold, inqurng after you, but&#xD;
he probably never received my letter."&#xD;
"Andyour father?" queried Electra proudly.&#xD;
"Father told mxe nothing." *    ..&#xD;
"is the grave not deep enough for his&#xD;
hate ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" What;do you mean ?"   -&#xD;
"You don't probably know all that I do;&#xD;
but this is no place to discuss such matters ;&#xD;
some time we will talk of it. Do come and&#xD;
see me soon-soon. I must go now, I prom-&#xD;
ised."            .                   .&#xD;
"Where do you live; I will go home with&#xD;
you now.".4&#xD;
"I am not going home immediately. Mr.&#xD;
Clifton's house' is No. 85 West-,  street.&#xD;
Come this afternoon."&#xD;
With a long, warm pressure of hands they&#xD;
parted, and Irene stood looking after the&#xD;
graceful figure till it glided out of sight.&#xD;
"In the name of wonder, who is that ? You&#xD;
two have been the observedd of all observers,'&#xD;
ejaculated the impulsive Louisa.&#xD;
"That is my od school-mate and friend of&#xD;
whom I once spoke to you. I had no idea&#xD;
that she wasin New York. She is a poor or-&#xD;
phan.".&#xD;
"Are you ready to return home?    This&#xD;
episode has evidently driven pictures out of&#xD;
your head for to-day," said Mr. Young, who&#xD;
had endeavored to screen her from obser-&#xD;
vation.&#xD;
"Yes, quite ready to go, though .Y have&#xD;
enjoyed the morning very much indeed, thanks&#xD;
to your kindness."&#xD;
Soon after they reached home Louisa was&#xD;
called inter the parlor to see a young friend';&#xD;
and as Mrs. Young was absent, Irene found it&#xD;
rather lonely up stairs. She thought of a new&#xD;
volume of travels which she had noticed on&#xD;
the hall-table as they entered, and started&#xD;
down to get it. About half-way of the flight'&#xD;
of steps she caught ,her foot in the carpeting,&#xD;
where one of the rods chanced to be loose, and,&#xD;
despite her efforts, to grasp the railing, fell to&#xD;
the floor of the hall, crushing one arm under&#xD;
her. The library-door was thrown open in.&#xD;
stantly, and the minister came out. She lay&#xD;
motionless, and he bentover her;&#xD;
"Irene I where are 'you hurt ?  Speak to&#xD;
me."&#xD;
He raised her in his arms  an. placed her&#xD;
on the sofa in the sitting-room. The motion&#xD;
produced great pain, and she groaned and&#xD;
shut her eyes. A crystal vase containing&#xD;
some exquisite perfume stood on his mother's&#xD;
work-table, and, pouring a portion of the&#xD;
contents in his palm, he bathed her forehead.&#xD;
Acute suffering distorted her features, and.&#xD;
his face grew pallid as her own while he&#xD;
watched her. Taking her hand, he repeated:&#xD;
"Irene, my darling ! tell me how you are&#xD;
hurt ?"&#xD;
She looked at him, and said with some dif-&#xD;
"ficulty :&#xD;
" My ankle pains me very much, and I be-&#xD;
lieve my arm is broken. I can't move it-"&#xD;
" Thank God you were not killed.'"&#xD;
He kissed her, then turned away and de-&#xD;
spatched a servant for a physician. He sum-&#xD;
moned Louisa,' and inqtired fruitlessly for his&#xD;
&#xD;
mother ; no one knew. whither she had gone ;&#xD;
it would not do to wait for her. He stood by&#xD;
the sofa and prepared the necessary bandages,&#xD;
while his sister could only cry over and caress&#xD;
the sufferer. When the physician came the&#xD;
white dimpled arm was bared, and he discov-&#xD;
ered that the bone was broken. - The setting&#xD;
was extremely painful, but she lay with closed&#xD;
eyes and firmly compressed lips, uttering no&#xD;
sound, giving no token of the torture, save in&#xD;
the wrinkling of her forehead. They bound&#xD;
the arm tightly, and then the doctor said that&#xD;
the ankle was badly strained and swollen, but&#xD;
there was, luckily, no fracture.. He gave&#xD;
minute directions to the minister and with-&#xD;
drew, praising the patient's remarkable forti-&#xD;
tude. Louisa would talk, and her brother&#xD;
sent her off to prepare a room for her friend.&#xD;
" I think I had better go back to the' Insti-&#xD;
tute, Mr. Young. - It will be a long time be-&#xD;
fore I can walk again, and I wish you would&#xD;
have me. carried' back. Dr. -  will be so&#xD;
uneasy; and-will prefer my returning, as Fath-&#xD;
er left me in his- charge." She tried to rise,&#xD;
but sank  back on the pillow.&#xD;
"Hush ! hush ! You will stay where you are,.&#xD;
little cripple. I am only thankful you hap-&#xD;
pened to be here."'&#xD;
He smoothed the folds' of hair from her&#xD;
temples, and for the first time played with the"&#xD;
curls he had so often before -been tempted to&#xD;
touch. She looked so slight, so childish, with'&#xD;
her head nestled against the pillow, that he&#xD;
forgot she was almost sixteen, forgot every-&#xD;
thing but the beauty of the pale face, and&#xD;
bent over her with an expression of the ten-&#xD;
derest love. She was suffering too much- to&#xD;
notice his countenance, and only felt that he&#xD;
was very kind and gentle. Mrs. Young came&#xD;
in very soon, and heard with the deepest so-&#xD;
licitude of what had occurred. Irene again&#xD;
requested to be taken to. the school, fearing&#xD;
that she would cause too much trouble during,&#xD;
her long confinement to the house. But Mrs.&#xD;
.Young stopped her arguments with kisses, and&#xD;
would listen to no such arrangement; .'she&#xD;
would -trust to no one 'but herself to nurse&#xD;
"the bruised Southern lily."  Having seen&#xD;
that all was in readiness, she insisted on ear-&#xD;
rying her guest to th% room adjoining Louiaa's&#xD;
and opening into her, own. Mr. Young had&#xD;
gone to Boston the day before; and, turning to&#xD;
her son, she said :&#xD;
" Harvey, as your father is away, you must&#xD;
take Irene up stairs ; I am not strong enough.&#xD;
Be careful thAt you do not hurt her.'&#xD;
She led the' way, and bending down, he&#xD;
whispered:&#xD;
"My little sister, put this uninjured arm&#xD;
around my neck ; there-now I shall carry&#xD;
you as easily as if you were in a cradle."&#xD;
He 'held her firmly, and as lie bore her up&#xD;
the steps the white face lay oif his .bosom and.&#xD;
the golden hair floated against his cheek. If&#xD;
she had looked at him then, she 'would have&#xD;
&#xD;
seen more than he intended that any one&#xD;
should know; for, young and free from vanity&#xD;
though she was, it was impossible to mistake&#xD;
the expression of the eyes riveted upon her.&#xD;
She never knew how his great heart throbbed,&#xD;
nor suspected that he turned his lips to the&#xD;
streaming curls. As he consigned her to his&#xD;
mother's care she held out her hand and&#xD;
thanked him for hisgreat kindness, little dream-&#xD;
ing of the emotions with which he held -her&#xD;
fingers. He very considerately offered to go&#xD;
at one to the principal of'the school and ac-&#xD;
quaint him with all that had occurred; and,&#xD;
ere long, when an anodyne had been adminis-&#xD;
tered, she fell asleep, and found tempo ry&#xD;
relief. Mrs. Young wrote immediately to 1r.&#xD;
Huntingdon, and explained the circumstances&#xD;
which had made his daughter her guest for.&#xD;
some weeks at least, assuring him that he need&#xD;
indulge no apprehension whatever on her ac-&#xD;
count, as sh Would nurse her as tenderly asa&#xD;
mother could. Stupefied by the opiate, Irene&#xD;
took little;notice of what passed, except when&#xD;
roused by the pain consequent upon dressing&#xD;
the ankle. Louisa went to school as usual&#xD;
but her mother rarely left their guest; and&#xD;
after Mr..Young's return he treated her with&#xD;
all the affectionate consideration of a parent.&#xD;
Several days after the occurrence of the acci-&#xD;
dent Irene turned toward the minister, who&#xD;
stood talking to his mother.&#xD;
"Your constant kindness emboldens me to&#xD;
ask a favor of you, which I think .you will&#xD;
scarcely' deny me. I am very anxious to see&#xD;
the friend whom I so unexpectedly met at the&#xD;
Academy of Design ; and if she knew the cir-&#xD;
cumstances that prevent my leaving the house,&#xD;
I am very sure she would come to me. Here&#xD;
is a card containing her address; will you&#xD;
spare me the time to bring her here to-day ?&#xD;
I shall be very much obliged to you.&#xD;
"I think you ought to kee perfectly quiet,&#xD;
and see no company for a fewdays. Can't&#xD;
you wait patiently ?"&#xD;
" It will do me no harm to see her. I feel&#xD;
as if I could,-not wait."&#xD;
"Very well, I will go after her as soon as&#xD;
I have fulfilled a previous engagement. What&#xD;
is her name"?"&#xD;
" Electra Grey. Did you notice her face ?"&#xD;
" Yes; but why do you ask ?"&#xD;
" Because I think she resembles your moth-&#xD;
er."&#xD;
" She resembles far more an old portrait&#xD;
hanging in my room. I remarked it as soon as&#xD;
I saw her."&#xD;
He seemed lost in thought, and immediately&#xD;
after left the room. An hour later Irene's&#xD;
listening ear detected the opening and closing&#xD;
of the hall.door.&#xD;
" There is Electra on the steps ; I hear het&#xD;
voice. Will you please open the door ?'?&#xD;
Mrs. Young laid down 'her work and rose 'to&#xD;
comply, but Harvey ushered the stranger in&#xD;
and then retired.&#xD;

The lady of the house looked at the new-&#xD;
comer, and a startledrexpression came instant-&#xD;
ly into her countenance. , She made a step&#xD;
forward and paused irresolute.&#xD;
"Mrs. Young, allow me to introduce my&#xD;
friend, Miss Electra Grey." Electra bowed,&#xD;
and Mrs. Ybung exclaimed :&#xD;
" Grey ! Grey! Electra Grey; and so like&#xD;
- Robes '/ Oh ! it must be so. Child, who are&#xD;
you ? Where are your parents ?"&#xD;
She approached, and put her hand on the&#xD;
girl's shoulders, while a hopeful light kindled&#xD;
in her eyes.&#xD;
"I am an orphan, Madam, from the South.&#xD;
My father died before my birth-my mother&#xD;
immediately after."&#xD;
" Was your father's name Robert ? Where&#xD;
was he from ?"&#xD;
" His name was Enoch R. Grey. I don't&#xD;
know what his middle name was. He came&#xD;
originally from Pennsylvania, I believe."  '&#xD;
"-Oh! I knew that I could not be mistaken !&#xD;
My brother's child ! Robert's 'child I"&#xD;
She threw her arms around the astonished&#xD;
girl and strained her to her heart.&#xD;
" There must be some . mistake, Madam.&#xD;
I never heard that I had relatives in New&#xD;
York."&#xD;
"Oh, child ! call me Aunt ; I am your&#xD;
father's sister. We called him by his middle&#xD;
name, 'Robert, and for eiglhteen-years have&#xD;
heard nothing of him. Sit down here, and&#xD;
let me tell you the , circumstances.  Your&#xD;
'father was the youngest of three children, and&#xD;
in his youth gave us peat distress by his wild-&#xD;
ness; he ran away from college and went to&#xD;
sea. After an absence of three years he re-&#xD;
turned, almost a wreck of his former self. My&#xD;
mother had died during his long voyage to the&#xD;
South Sea islands, and father, who believed&#xD;
him to have, been the remote cause of her&#xD;
death (for her health failed soon after he left),&#xD;
upbraided him most harshly and unwisely.&#xD;
His reproaches drove poor Robert to despera-&#xD;
tion,.and, without givig us any clew, he left&#xD;
home as suddenly as before.'Whither he went&#xD;
we never knew. Father was so incensed that&#xD;
he entirely 'disinherited him; but at hisdeath,&#xD;
when the estate was divided, my Brother Wil-&#xD;
liam and I decided that we would take only&#xD;
what we considered our proportion, and we&#xD;
set apart one-third for Robert. We advertised&#xD;
for, several years, but could hear nothing of&#xD;
him; and at the end of the fifth year William&#xD;
divided that remainin third. We knew that&#xD;
he must have died, and I have passed many a&#xD;
sleepless night weeping over his wretched lot,&#xD;
mourtnng that no kind words -reached 'him.&#xD;
from us---that no monumental stone marked&#xD;
his unknown grave. Oh, my - dear child ! I&#xD;
am so glad to find you out. But where have&#xD;
you been all this time ? Where did Robert&#xD;
die ?"&#xD;
She held the orphan's hand, and made no&#xD;
attempt to conceal the tears that rolled over&#xD;
&#xD;
N&#xD;
&#xD;
her cheeks.. Electra gave her a detailed ac-&#xD;
count of her life from the time when she was&#xD;
taken to her uncle, Mr. Aubrey, at the age of&#xD;
four months, till the death of her aunt and&#xD;
her removal to New York.&#xD;
" And Robert's child has been in want,&#xD;
while we knew not of her existence ! Oh,&#xD;
Electra ! you shall have no more sorrow'.that&#xD;
we can shield you from. I loved. your father&#xD;
very 'devotedly, and I shall love his orphan&#xD;
quite as dearly. Come to me ; let me be your&#xD;
mother. Let me repair the wrong of by-gone&#xD;
years."&#xD;
She folded her arms around the graceful&#xD;
young. form and sobbed. aloud, while Irene&#xD;
fpund it difficult to repress her own tears of&#xD;
sympathy and joy that her friend had found&#xD;
such relatives. Of the three, Electra was&#xD;
calmest. Though glad to meet with her&#xD;
father's family, she knew better than they that&#xD;
this circumstance could make little alteration&#xD;
in her life, and therefore, when Mrs. Young&#xD;
left the room to acquaint her husband and son&#xD;
with the discovery she had. made, Electra sat&#xD;
down beside her friend's sofa just as she would&#xD;
have done two hours before.&#xD;
" I am so glad for your sake that you are to&#xD;
come and live here. Until you know them all&#xD;
as well as I do, you can not properly appreci-&#xD;
ate your good fortune," said .'Irene, raising&#xD;
herself on her elbow.&#xD;
" Yes, I am very glad to meet my aunt," re-&#xD;
turned Electra evasively, and then she added&#xD;
earnestly:&#xD;
"But I rather think that I am gladder still&#xD;
to see you again. Oh, Irene !lit seems an age&#xD;
since I came to this city. We have both&#xD;
changed a good deal; you look graver than&#xD;
when we parted that spring morning that you&#xD;
took me to see the painter. I owe even his&#xD;
acquaintance to your kindness."&#xD;
" Tell me of all that happened after I left&#xD;
home. You know that I have heard noth-&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
The orphan narrated the circumstances&#xD;
connected with her aunt's last illness and'&#xD;
death ; the wretchedness that came upon her&#xD;
and Russell; the necessity of their separation.&#xD;
"And where is Russell now ?"&#xD;
"At home-that is, still with Mr. Campbell,&#xD;
who has proved a kind friend. Russell writes&#xD;
once a week ; he seems tolerably cheerful, and&#xD;
speaks confidently of- his future as a lawyer.&#xD;
He studies very hard, and,I know that he will&#xD;
succeed."&#xD;
" Your cousin is very ambitious. I wish he&#xD;
could have had a good education."&#xD;
"It will be all the same in the end. He&#xD;
will educate himself thoroughly; he needs no-&#xD;
body's 'assistance," answered Electra with a&#xD;
proud smile.&#xD;
" When you'write to him again don't forget&#xD;
to tender him' my remembrances and best&#xD;
wishes."&#xD;
" Thank you."      .      '&#xD;
&#xD;
MACARIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
. A slight change came over the orphan's&#xD;
countenance, and her companion noted with-&#xD;
out understanding it.&#xD;
" Electra, you spoke of my father the other&#xD;
day in a way that puzzled me, and I wish, if&#xD;
you please, you would tell me what you&#xD;
meant."&#xD;
"I don't know that I ought to talk about&#xD;
things that should have been buried before&#xD;
you were born. But you probably know some-&#xD;
thing of what happened. We found out after&#xD;
you left why you were so suddenly sent off to&#xD;
boarding-school, and you can have no idea&#xD;
how 4nuch my poor aunt was distressed at the&#xD;
thought of having caused your banishment.&#xD;
Irene, your father hated her, and of course&#xD;
y6u know it ; but do you know why ?"&#xD;
"No; I never could imagine aiy adequate'&#xD;
cause."&#xD;
" Well I can tell you. Before Aunt Amy's&#xD;
marriage your father loved her, and to please&#xD;
her parents she accepted him. She was mis-&#xD;
erable, because she was very much attached to&#xD;
my uncle, and asked Mr. Huntingdon to re-&#xD;
lease her from the engagement. He declined,&#xD;
and, finding that her parents sided with him,&#xD;
she left home and married against their wishes.,&#xD;
They adopted a distant relative, and never&#xD;
gave her a cent. Your father never forgave&#xD;
her. He had great influence with the gov-&#xD;
ernor, and she went to him and entreated him&#xD;
to aid her in procuring a pardon for her hus-&#xD;
band. He repulsed her cruelly, and used.'his;&#xD;
influence against my uncle. She afterward&#xD;
saw a letter which Ihe wrote to the governor,&#xD;
urging him to withhold a pardon. Oh, Irene !&#xD;
if ,you could have seen Russell when he found&#xD;
out all this. .Now you have thekey to his&#xD;
hatred; now you understand why he wrote&#xD;
you nothing concerning us. Not even Aunt&#xD;
Amy's coffin could shut in his hate.".&#xD;
She rose, and, walking to the window, press-,&#xD;
ed her face against the panes to cool her burn-&#xD;
ing cheeks.&#xD;
Irene had put her hand over her eyes, and&#xD;
a. fearful panorama of coming years rolled&#xD;
before her in that brief moment. She saw with'&#xD;
miserable distinctness the parallelism between&#xD;
Mrs. Aubrey's father and her own, and, sick&#xD;
at heart, she moaned, contemplating her lot.&#xD;
A feeling ,of remorseful compassion touched&#xD;
the orphan as she heard the smothered sound,&#xD;
and, resuming her seat, she said gently:&#xD;
" Do not be distressed, Irene; 'let the dead&#xD;
past bury its dead;' it is all over-now, and&#xD;
no more harm can come of it. I shall be sorry&#xD;
that I told you if you let it trouble you."I&#xD;
Irene knew too well that it *as not over;&#xD;
that it was but the beginning of harm to'her;&#xD;
but she repressed her emotion, and changed&#xD;
the subject by -'inquiring 'how Electra pro-&#xD;
gressed with her painting.&#xD;
" Even better than I hoed. *Mr. Clifton is&#xD;
an adinirable master, and does all' that he can&#xD;
to aid me. I shall succeed, Irene I- I know, I&#xD;
&#xD;
45&#xD;
&#xD;
feel that I shall, and it is a great joy to&#xD;
me."&#xD;
" I -am very glad to hear it; but now- You&#xD;
will have no need to -labor, as you once ex-&#xD;
pected to do. You are looking. much better&#xD;
than I ever, saw you, and have grown taller.&#xD;
You are nearly sixteen, I believe ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sixteen. I am three months your&#xD;
senior. 'Irene, I must go home now, for they&#xD;
will wonder what has become of me. I will&#xD;
see you again soon."&#xD;
Sbe was detained by her aunt, and present-&#xD;
ed to the remainder of the family, and it was&#xD;
arranged that Mr. and Mrs. Young should&#xD;
visit her the ensuing day. While they talked&#xD;
over the tea-table of the newly-found,. Harvey&#xD;
went slowly up stairs and knocked at Irene's&#xD;
door. Louisa was chattering delightedly about&#xD;
'her cousin, and, sending her down .to her tea,&#xD;
he took her seat beside the sofa. Irene lay&#xD;
with her fingers over her eyes, and he said&#xD;
gently :&#xD;
" You see that I am wiser than you, Irene.&#xD;
I knew that it would do you no good to have&#xD;
company. Next time be advised." ,&#xD;
"It was not Electra that harmed me."&#xD;
" Then you admit that you, 'have been&#xD;
harmed ?"&#xD;
" No; I am low-spirited to-night; I believe-&#xD;
that is all."&#xD;
" You have not studied dialectics yet. Peo-&#xD;
pleeare not. low-spirited without a cause ; tell&#xD;
me what troubles you."&#xD;
She turned her face to the wall, and- an-&#xD;
swered :&#xD;
, " Oh ! there is nothing which I can tell you,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
"Irene, why ao you distrust me ?"&#xD;
"I do not; indeed I do not. You must not&#xD;
believe that for one moment."&#xD;
"Y  u are distressed, and yet will not con-&#xD;
fide in me."&#xD;
"It is something. which I ought not to'tell&#xD;
even my friend-my brother."&#xD;
" You are sure that it is something I could&#xD;
not remedy?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir ; perfectly sure."&#xD;
" Then try to forget it, and let me read to&#xD;
you."&#xD;
He opened the "'Rambler," of which she&#xD;
was particularly fond, and began to reads&#xD;
For a while she listened, and in her interest&#xD;
forgot her forebodings,.but after a time, the&#xD;
long silky lashes swept her cheeks, and she&#xD;
slept. The minister laid down the volume and&#xD;
watched the pure girlish face ; noted all its&#xD;
witching lovelinesb, and thought of the homage'&#xD;
which it would win her in coming years. A&#xD;
few more fleeting months, and she wouldreign&#xD;
the undisputed jueen of so,eiety. Wealth in-&#xD;
tellect, manly beauty, all would bow beore&#xD;
her ; and she was a woman ;' would doubtless&#xD;
love and marry, like, the majority of women.&#xD;
He set this fact before him and lookedd it in&#xD;
the face,' but it would not answer ; he coul4&#xD;

&#xD;
not realize that she would ever be other than&#xD;
the trusting, noble-hearted, beautiful child&#xD;
which. she was to him. He knew as he sat&#xD;
watching her slumber that he loved her ktbove&#xD;
everything on earth ; that she wielded a pow-&#xD;
er none had ever possessed before-that his&#xD;
heart was indissolubly linked with 'her. He&#xD;
had wrestled with this infatuation, had station-&#xD;
ed himself on the platform of sound common&#xD;
sense, and railed at and ridiculed this piece of&#xD;
folly. His clear, cool reason gave solemn ver-&#xD;
dict against the fiercely-throbbing heart, but&#xD;
not one, pulsation had been restrained. At&#xD;
his age, with his profession and long-laid plans,&#xD;
this was arrant madness, and he admitted it ;&#xD;
but the long down-trodden'feelings of his heart,&#xD;
having gained momentary freedom, exulting-&#xD;
ly ran riot and refused to be. reined in. lie&#xD;
might just as *ell have laid his palm on the&#xD;
whitened crest of surging billows in stormy,&#xD;
tropical seas, and bid them sink softly down to&#xD;
their coral pavements. Human' passions, ha-&#xD;
tred, 'ambition, revenge, love, are despots;&#xD;
and the minister, who for thirty years had&#xD;
struggled for mastery over these, now found&#xD;
himself a slave. He had studied Irene's&#xD;
countenance too well not to know that a shad-&#xD;
ow rested on it now ; add it grieved apd per-&#xD;
plexed him that she should conceal this trouble&#xD;
from him. As he sat looking down at her a&#xD;
mighty barrier rose between them. His future&#xD;
hadlong been determined-duty called him to&#xD;
the rude huts of the far West; thither pointed&#xD;
the finger of Destiny, and thither, at all haz-&#xD;
ards, he would go. He thought that he 'had&#xD;
habituated himself to sacrifices, but the spirit&#xD;
of self-abnegation was scarcely equal to this&#xD;
trial. Reason taught him that the tenderly-&#xD;
nurtured child of southern climes would never&#xD;
suit him for' a companion in the pioneer-life&#xD;
'which he had marked out. Of course, he must&#xD;
leave her ; hundreds of miles would intervene ;&#xD;
his memory would. fade from her mind, and&#xD;
for him it only remained to bury her image in&#xD;
the prairies of his new home. He folded his&#xD;
arms tightly over his chest, and resolved to go&#xD;
promptly..&#xD;
The gas-light flashed on Irene's hair as it&#xD;
hung over the side of the sofa; he stooped&#xD;
and pressed his lips to the floating curls, and&#xD;
went down to the library smiling grimly at&#xD;
his own folly. Without delay he wrote two&#xD;
letters, and was dating a third, when hi&#xD;
mother came in. Placing a chair for her, he&#xD;
laid down his pen.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you, Mother; I want to&#xD;
have a talk with you."  ',&#xD;
"About what, Harvey ?" an anxious look&#xD;
settled on her face.  -'&#xD;
"About my leaving you, and going West. I&#xD;
have decided to start next week." .&#xD;
" Oh, my son'! how can you bring such&#xD;
grief upon me ? Surely 'there is work enough&#xD;
for you to do here, without your tearing yout-&#xD;
aif' from us."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Yes, Mother, work enough, but hands&#xD;
enough also, without nine. These are the&#xD;
sunny slopes of the Vineyard, and laborers&#xD;
crowd to till them; but there are cold, shad-&#xD;
owy, barren nooks and corners that equally&#xD;
demand cultivation. There the lines have&#xD;
fallen to me, and there I go to my work. Nay,&#xD;
Mother ! don't weep; don't heighten, by your&#xD;
entreaties and remonstrances, the barriers to&#xD;
my departure. It is peculiarly the province&#xD;
of such as I to set forth for this field of opera-&#xD;
tions ; men who have wives and children have&#xD;
no right to subject them to the privations and&#xD;
hardships of pioneer life. But I am alone-&#xD;
shall always be-so-and' this call I feel to be&#xD;
imperative. You know that I have dedicated&#xD;
myself to the ministry, and whatever I firmly&#xD;
believe to be my duty to the holy cause I have&#xD;
espoused, that I must do even though it sepa-&#xD;
rate me from my mother. It is a severe ordeal&#xD;
to me-you will probably never know 'how&#xD;
severe; but we who profess to yield up all&#xD;
things for Christ must not shrink from sacri-&#xD;
fice. -I shall come back now and then, and&#xD;
letters are a blessed medium of communica-&#xD;
tion and consolation. I have delayed my de-&#xD;
parture too long already."&#xD;
" Oh, Harvey h.have you fully determined&#xD;
on this step ?".&#xD;
"Y es, my dear Mother, fully determined to&#xD;
go."&#xD;
a It is very hard for me to give up my only&#xD;
son. Can't say that I will reconcile myself&#xD;
to this separation ; but you are old enough to&#xD;
decide your own future; and I suppose I&#xD;
ought not to urge you. For months I have&#xD;
opposed your resolution ; now I will not longer&#xD;
remonstrate. Oh, Harvey ! it makes my heart&#xD;
ache to part with you. if you were married,&#xD;
I should be better satisfied; but to think of'&#xD;
you in your loneliness l" She laid her head&#xD;
on his shoulder, and wept.&#xD;
The minister compressed his lips firmly an&#xD;
instant, then replied:&#xD;
"1 always told you that I should never mar-&#xD;
ry.  I shall be too constantly-occupied to sit&#xD;
down and feel lonely. Now, Mother, I must&#xD;
finish my letters, if you please, for'they should&#xD;
go by the earliest mail."&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
The artist stood at the window watching&#xD;
for his pupil's return; it was the late afternoon&#xD;
hour, which they were wont to spend in read-&#xD;
ing, and her'absence annoyed him..A s he&#xD;
rested carelessly against the window, ,his&#xD;
graceful form was displayed to great advan-&#xD;
tage, and the long brown hair drooped about&#xD;
a' classical face of almost feminine beauty.,&#xD;
The delicacy of his features was enhanced by&#xD;
the extreme pallor of his complexion, and it&#xD;
was apparent that close application to his pro-&#xD;
&#xD;
fession had made serious inroads on a consti-&#xD;
tution never very robust.  A certain listless-&#xD;
ness of manner, a sort of lazy-grace seemed&#xD;
characteristic ; but, when his pupil came in&#xD;
and laid aside her bonnet, the expression of&#xD;
ennui vanished, And he threw himself on a&#xD;
sofa, looking infinitely relieved. She drew&#xD;
near, and without hesitation acquainted him&#xD;
with the discovery of her relatives in, New&#xD;
York. He listened in painful surprise, and,&#xD;
ere she had concluded, sprang .up. "I un-&#xD;
derstand I they will want to take you ;, will&#xD;
urge you to share their home of wealth, But,&#xD;
Elect ra, you won't leave me ; surely you&#xD;
won't leave me ?"&#xD;
He put his hands on. her shoulders, and she&#xD;
knew from his quick, irregular breathing that&#xD;
the thought of separation greatly distressed&#xD;
him.&#xD;
' My aunt has not explicitly invited me to&#xD;
reside with her, though I inferred from her&#xD;
manner that she confidently expected me to&#xD;
do, so. Irene also spoke of it as a settled&#xD;
matter."&#xD;
"'You will not allow them to persuade you ?&#xD;
Oh, child ! tell me at once that you will never&#xD;
leave me."&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton, we must part sone, day ; I&#xD;
can not always live here, you know.  Before&#xD;
very long I must go out and earn my bread."&#xD;
" Never I while I live. When' I offered'&#xD;
you a home,.I expected it to be a'permanent&#xD;
one. .1 intended to adopt you:  Here, if you,&#xD;
choose, you may work and earn a reputation ;&#xD;
but away from me, among strangers, never.&#xD;
Electra, you forget ; you gave yourself to me&#xD;
once.'&#xD;
She shuddered, and tried to release herself,&#xD;
but the hands were relentless in their grasp.&#xD;
"Electra, you belong to me, . my child.&#xD;
Whom have I-to love but you, my dear pupil'?&#xD;
What should I do without you ?"&#xD;
"1 Ihave~n tention of livig with my aunt;&#xD;
I desire to be under obligations to no one buti&#xD;
yourself. But I am very proud, and even tem-&#xD;
porary dependence on you galls me. You are,&#xD;
I believe, the best friend I have on earth, and4&#xD;
until I can support myself I will remain under&#xD;
your care; longer than that, it would' be im-&#xD;
possible. I am bound \ to you, my generous,&#xD;
kind master, as to no one else."&#xD;
" This'-does not satisfy me; .the thought that l&#xD;
you' will leave me, at even a distant day, will&#xD;
haunt me coptinually-marring all my joy.&#xD;
It can not be, Electra ! You gave'yourself tot&#xD;
me once, and I claim you."&#xD;
Shp looked into his eyes, and, 'with a, wom-1&#xD;
an's quick perception, read all-the truth.&#xD;
In an instant .her countenance changed&#xD;
painfully.; she stooped, touched his hand with&#xD;
hrlps, and exclaimed: -,-&#xD;
"Ihank you, a thousand times, my friend,&#xD;
my father ! for your interest in, and your un-t&#xD;
varying, unparalleled kindness to me. All ~&#xD;
thegratitude and affection which a child could&#xD;
&#xD;
,give to a parent I shall always cherish toward&#xD;
you. Since it annoys you, we will say no&#xD;
more boat the ftiture; let the years take care&#xD;
of themselves as they .come."&#xD;
"Will   u promise me, positively,'that you&#xD;
will not go to your aunt ?"&#xD;
"Yes ; I have never seriously entertained&#xD;
the thought."&#xD;
She escaped from his hands, and, lighting&#xD;
the gas, applied herself to her books for the.&#xD;
next hour.&#xD;
If Irene had found the restraint of boarding-&#xD;
school irksome, the separation from Russell was&#xD;
well nigh intolerable to Electra. ,At4lrst she&#xD;
had seemed plugged in lethargy; butafter a&#xD;
time this mood gave place to restless, unceas-&#xD;
ing activity. ,Like 'one trying to flee from&#xD;
something painful, she rushed daily to her&#xD;
work, and regretted when the hours of dark-&#xD;
ness consignee her to reflection. Mrs. Cliftoil&#xD;
was quite aged, and though:unirmly gentle&#xD;
and affectionate toward the   phan, there&#xD;
was no common ground' of congeniality on&#xD;
which they could meet. To a,.,roud, exact-&#xD;
ing nature like Electra's, Mr. Ulifton's eon-&#xD;
stant manifestations of lone and sympathy&#xD;
were very soothing. Writhing under the con-&#xD;
sciousnes of her cousin's indifference, she&#xD;
turned eagerly to receive the tokens of affee-&#xD;
tion showered upon her. She knew that his&#xD;
happiness centred in her, and vainly fancied&#xD;
that she could feed her hungry heart with his&#xD;
adoration. But by degrees she realized that&#xD;
these husks would not satisfy her ; and a sin-&#xD;
gular sensation of mingled gratitude and im-&#xD;
patience arose whenever he caressed her. In&#xD;
his house her fineintellect found ample range;&#xD;
an extensive library wooed her, when not en-&#xD;
gaged with her pencil, and with eager cur-&#xD;
osity she plunged into various departments of&#xD;
study.  As might easily have been predicted,&#xD;
from. the idealistic tendency of her entire&#xD;
mental confirmation, she early selected the&#xD;
imaginative realm as peculiarly her own.,&#xD;
Over moth-eaten volumes of mythologic lore&#xD;
she pored continually; effete theogonies and&#xD;
cosmogonies seized upon her .fancy, and peo-&#xD;
pled all space with the gods and heroes:of&#xD;
most ancient days. She lived among weird&#xD;
phantasmagoric creations of Sagas and J url&#xD;
nas, and roamed from Asgard to Kinkaddlle,&#xD;
having little sympathy or care for the realities&#xD;
that surrounded her. Mr..Clifton's associates&#xD;
were principally.artists,-and the conversations&#xD;
to which slts listened tended to increase her&#xD;
enthusiasm for the profession she had chosen.&#xD;
She had' no f 'ale companion except Mr$&#xD;
Clplton,'and little leisure to -discuss the topics&#xD;
which ordinarily-^engage girls of her age, The&#xD;
warm gushnga of hr heart were driven back&#xD;
to their sprims and locked from human gazei&#xD;
yet shesomete 'felt her isolation almost in-&#xD;
olerable. :To escape from herself she' was&#xD;
goaded into feverish'activity, and, toiling To-&#xD;
lay, shut her eyes to the To-morrow.&#xD;

She counted the days between Itussell's&#xD;
leters ; when they arrived, snatched them with&#xD;
trembling fingers, and hastened to,. her own&#xD;
room to devour them. Once read and folded&#xD;
away, this thought fell, with leaden weight&#xD;
upon her heart': " There is so little in this let-&#xD;
ter, and now I must wait another long week&#xD;
for the next." He never surmised half her&#xD;
wretchedness, for she proudly concealed her&#xD;
discontent, and wrote.as if happy and hopeful.&#xD;
The shell of her reserve was beautifully pol-&#xD;
ished and painted,.and it never occurred to&#xD;
him that 'it enclosed dark cells where only&#xD;
wailings echoed. In figure, shewas decidedly&#xD;
petit, but faultlessly sjmmetrigal and grace-&#xD;
; and the piquant ,beauty of her face won&#xD;
her the admiration of those who frequented&#xD;
the studio.&#xD;
Among the artists especially she was a well-&#xD;
established pet, privileged to inspect their&#xD;
work whenever she felt disposed, and always&#xD;
warmly welcomed. They encouraged her in&#xD;
her work, stimulated her by no means dor-&#xD;
mant ambition, and predicted a brilliant and&#xD;
successful career. Mrs. Clifton was a rigid&#xD;
Roman Catholic; her son a free-thinker, in the&#xD;
broadest significance of the term, if one might&#xD;
judge from the 'selections that adorned his&#xD;
library shelves. But deep in hissoul was the&#xD;
germination of a mystical creed, which gradu-&#xD;
ally unfolded itself to Electra. The simple&#xD;
yet sublime faith of her aunt rapidly faded&#xD;
from the girl's heart; she turned from its se-&#xD;
vere simplicity to the gorgeous accessories of&#xD;
other systems. The pomp of ceremonial, the&#xD;
bewildering adjuncts of another creed, wooed&#xD;
her overweening, excited fancy. Of doctrine&#xD;
she kne* little 'and cared less; the bare walls&#xD;
and quiet service of the old church at home&#xD;
had for her no attraction; she revelled in dim&#xD;
cathedral light, among mellow, ancient pict-&#xD;
ures, where pale wreaths of incense curled, and&#xD;
solemn organ-tones whispered through marble&#xD;
aisles. She would sit with folded arms, watch-&#xD;
ing the forms of deirotees glide in and out, and&#xD;
prostrate themselves before'the images on the&#xD;
gilt altar; and Fancy wafted her, at such times,&#xD;
to the dead ages of imperial Greece, when de-&#xD;
vout hearts bore offerings to Delphi, belos,&#xD;
Dodona, and Eleusis. An arch-idolatress she&#xD;
would have been in the ancient days of her&#xD;
Mycenaean namesake-a priestess of Demeter&#xD;
or Artemis., At all hazards this dainty fancy&#xD;
must be pampered, and she gleaned aliment&#xD;
fromevery source that could possily yield it,&#xD;
fostering a despotic tendency which soon&#xD;
towered above every 'ether ,element of her&#xD;
being. The first glimpse of her teacher's&#xD;
Swe enborgian faith was sufficient to rivet her&#xD;
attention. S be watched the expansion of his&#xD;
theories, and essayed to follow the profound&#xD;
trains of argumentation, based on pysical&#xD;
analogies and correspondences, which td him&#xD;
so irresistibly to his conclusions. But dialectics&#xD;
foi-med no portion of her intellectual heritage,&#xD;
&#xD;
and her imagination seizing, by a kind of&#xD;
secret affinity, the spiritualistic elements of the&#xD;
system, turned with loathing from the granite-&#xD;
like, scientifiefundamentals. Irene would have&#xD;
gene down among the mortar and -bricks,&#xD;
measuring the foundations, but Electra gazed&#xD;
upon the exquisite acanthus-wreathings of the&#xD;
ornate capitals, the glowing frescos of the&#xD;
mighty nave, and here was content to rest.&#xD;
Mr. Clifton never attempted to restrain her&#xD;
movement or oppose her inclinations; like a&#xD;
bee she roved ,ceaselessly from book to book,&#xD;
seeking honey, and, without the safeguard of&#xD;
its unerring instinct, she. frequently gathered&#xD;
poison from lovely chalices. .Ah, Amy Aubrey !&#xD;
it was -an evil day for your orphan charge&#xD;
.when Atropos cut the tangled thread of your&#xD;
life, and you left her to, follow the dictates of&#xD;
her stormy temperament. Yet otherwise,&#xD;
nature could never have fullywoven the pat-&#xD;
tern; it would have been- but a;blurred, im-&#xD;
perfect design. It was late at night when&#xD;
Electra retired to her room and sat down to&#xD;
collect her thoughts after the unexpected&#xD;
occurrences of the day.&#xD;
More than one discovery had been made&#xD;
since the sunrise, which she awoke so early to&#xD;
study. She had found relatives, and an op-&#xD;
portunity of living luxuriously ; but, in the&#xD;
midst of this beautiful bouquet of surprises, a&#xD;
serpent's, head peered out at her. Once be-&#xD;
fore she thought she had caught sight of its&#xD;
writhing folds, but it vanished too instaiane-&#xD;
ously to furnish disquiet, Now its glittering&#xD;
eyes held her spell-bound ; like the Pentagram&#xD;
in Faust,,it kept her in "durance vile." She&#xD;
would fain have shut her. eyes had it been pos-&#xD;
sible. Mr. Clifton loved her : not as a teacher&#xD;
his pupil, not as guardian loves ward, not as&#xD;
-parent loves child. Perhaps he had not intend-&#xD;
ed that she should know it so soon, but his eyes&#xD;
had betrayed the secret. She saw perfectly.&#xD;
how matters stood. This, then, had prompted,.&#xD;
him, from the first, to render her assistance ;&#xD;
he had resolved to make her his wife; nothing&#xD;
less, would content him. She twisted . her&#xD;
white fingers in her hair, and gazed vacantly&#xD;
down on the carpet, and gradually the rich'&#xD;
crimson blood sank out of her face. She held&#xD;
his life in the hollow of her hand, and this she&#xD;
well knew ; death hung over him like the&#xD;
sword of Damocles; she had been told that&#xD;
any violent agitation or grief would bring on&#xD;
'the hemorrhage which he so much dreaded,&#xD;
and although he seemed stronger and better&#xD;
than usual, the insidious nature, of his disease&#xD;
gave-her little hope that he would ever be ro-'&#xD;
bust. To feign ignorance of his real feelings&#xD;
for her wouldprove but a temporary strata-&#xD;
gem;. the time must inevitably come, before&#xD;
long, when he would put aside this veil and&#xD;
set the truth before her. Hlow should she&#xD;
meet it.-how should she evade him? .,Accept&#xD;
the home which Mrs. Young would offer her,&#xD;
and leave him to suffer brietly, to sink swiftly&#xD;

like a 'mantle of blood' pver Sysrin valleys,&#xD;
and the oleanders fringing the gray, gloomy&#xD;
crags.and breathing:their exquisite fragrance'&#xD;
over the silent desolationof tl at grand city of&#xD;

yoir fondness for flowers; cul ivate it always;&#xD;
they are evangels of purity an faith, if we but&#xD;
unlockour hearts to their ministry.  Callous&#xD;
and sordid indee4must be th- t soul who fails.&#xD;
in, gratefatr appreciation of gifts: designed es-&#xD;
pecially to promote theh'appiness and adorn&#xD;
the dwellings of our race; for, in attestation of&#xD;
this truth, stand the 'huge,  hotry. tomes.of ge-&#xD;
ology, proving that the pre-Adamic ages were&#xD;
comparatively barren of' the gorgeons.flowers&#xD;
which.tapestried the' earth so munificently&#xD;
just ere man made his appearance on the stage.&#xD;
A' reverent student of the rocks, who spent his&#xD;
life i listening to the solemn, oracular whis-&#xD;
ers of their grand granite lips, that moved,&#xD;
Memnon-like, as he flashed the light of Reve-&#xD;
lation upon them, tells us:-' The poet accepted&#xD;
the bee as a sign of high significancee ; the ge-&#xD;
ologist, also, accepts her as a sign. 'Her en-&#xD;
tombed remains testify to the gradual fitting up&#xD;
of our earth as a place of habitation for ascreat-&#xD;
ure destined to seek delight for the mind and&#xD;
eye as. certainly as for, the grbsser senses, and&#xD;
in especial mark the introduction of stately&#xD;
forest-trees and the arrival of the delicious&#xD;
flowers.' A profound thinker and eloquent&#xD;
writer, who is now doing a noble work for his&#xD;
generation by pointing it to unstained sources&#xD;
of happiness, has said of flowers: ' They are&#xD;
chalices of Divine workmanship-of purple&#xD;
and scarletrand liquid gold-from which man&#xD;
is to drink the pure joy of beauty.' There is&#xD;
you know, a graduated scale of missionary&#xD;
work for all created things; man labors foi&#xD;
God and his race through deep, often tor&#xD;
tuous, channels, and nature-all animate and&#xD;
inanimate nature-ministers in feebler yet stil&#xD;
heaven-appointed processes. The trouble is&#xD;
that in the rush and din and whirl of life, w&#xD;
will not pause to note these sermons; ant&#xD;
from year to year the, whispered precepts&#xD;
of faith, hope, and charity fall on deaf ears&#xD;
Nature'is so prodigal of refining: elevating in&#xD;
fluences, and man is, so inaccessible in his iso&#xD;
lating, inflated agotism."&#xD;
-He paused, and busied himself in cutting the&#xD;
leMaes of a new-book, while Irene looked inti&#xD;
his calm, noble face, pondering .his words&#xD;
then her eyes went hack to the bouquet, an&#xD;
liO welt once more upon her.y&#xD;
"Irene, you look sober to-day; come, chee&#xD;
up. 'I don't want to carry that grave express&#xD;
saba' away with me. I want to remember&#xD;
your face as I first saw:it) unshadowed."&#xD;
"What do you mean? Are you going t&#xD;
leav home '"'&#xD;
"'Ye; da after to-morrow I bid farewell t&#xD;
ew York for a long time.: I rdm going t'&#xD;
the West to take charge of a church."&#xD;
~Oh, Mr. Young I surely you are not ii&#xD;
&#xD;
earnest? You can not intend, to separate&#xD;
yourself from your family'?"&#xD;
She dropped her flowers and leaned for-&#xD;
ward.,&#xD;
'"Yep, I have had it in contemplation for,&#xD;
more than a year, and, recently, I have _de-&#xD;
cided to remove at once."&#xD;
IlIe saw the great sorrow, written in her-&#xD;
countenance, the quick flutter of her lip, the&#xD;
large drops .that dimmed the violet eyes and&#xD;
gathered on.the'long golden lashes; and far'&#xD;
sweeter than, Eolian harps was the broken&#xD;
voice :    -.&#xD;
" What shall I do without you? who 'will&#xD;
encourage and advise me when you go ?"&#xD;
She leaned her forehead on her hands, and -&#xD;
a tear slid down and rested on her chin. The'&#xD;
sun was setting, and the crimson light flooding&#xD;
the room bathed her with glory, spreading&#xD;
a- halo around her.  He held his breath and&#xD;
gazed upon the drooping figure and bewitch&#xD;
ing face ; and in after year s, when his dark&#xD;
hair had grown silvery gray, he remembered&#xD;
the lovely sunlit vision that so entranced him,&#xD;
leaving an indelible image on heart and brain.&#xD;
He gently removed- the hands, and holding&#xD;
I them in his.said, in the measured, low tone so&#xD;
1 indictive of suppressed emotion:&#xD;
"Irene, my friend, you attach too much&#xD;
s importance, to the aid which I might render&#xD;
t you. You know your duty, and I feel assured&#xD;
s will not require to be reminded of it. Hence"-&#xD;
s forth our' -paths diverge widely. I go to a&#xD;
distant, section of our land, there to do my&#xD;
Father's work ; arid,. ere long, having con-&#xD;
eluded the prescribed course, you will return&#xD;
to your Southern home and take the position&#xD;
assigned you in society.  Thus, in all human&#xD;
e probability, we shall meet no more, for-  "&#xD;
" Oh, sir!'don't say that; you will come&#xD;
I back to visit your family, and then I shall see&#xD;
I you."&#xD;
s   " That is.scarcely probable, but we will not&#xD;
e discuss it now. ,'Ihere, is, however, a channel&#xD;
1 of communication for separated friends, and&#xD;
s of this we must avail ourselves. I shall write&#xD;
, to you from western wilds, and letters from&#xD;

at least one firm, faithful friend, waiting and&#xD;

Disengaging her fingers, which still clasped I&#xD;
hia tightly, he moved his ,chair backward andt&#xD;
took a.sma1, blank-book from his pocket, say-&#xD;

MAdARIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
slowly read the sixty-third and sixty-fourth&#xD;
chapters of. Isaiah. His voice was low and&#xD;
sweet as a woman's, and the calm lofty brow&#xD;
on which the light gleamed was smooth and&#xD;
fair as a child's, bearing no footprints of the&#xD;
thirty years that had crept over it. When the&#xD;
reading was concluded he knelt and prayed&#xD;
fe-vently for the girl, who sat with her face&#xD;
hidden-in her arms; prayed that she might be&#xD;
guided by the Almighty hand into paths of&#xD;
peace- and usefulness ; that she might, be&#xD;
strengthened to do the work required of her.&#xD;
There was no unsteadiness in his tone, no trace&#xD;
of emotion, when he ended his prayer and&#xD;
stood up before her. Irene was deeply moved,&#xD;
and; when she essayed to thank him, found it&#xD;
impossible to pronounce her words. Tears&#xD;
were sliding down her cheeks ; he put back&#xD;
the hair, and, taking th face softly in his palms,&#xD;
looked long and earnestly at its fascinating&#xD;
beauty. The great glistening blue eyes gazed&#xD;
into his, and the silk y lashes and rich scarlet&#xD;
lips trembled. He felt the hot blood surging&#xD;
like a lava-tide in his veins,' and his heart&#xD;
rising in fierce rebellion at the stern interdict&#xD;
which he saw fit to lay upon it; butino token&#xD;
of all this came to the cool, cahn surface.&#xD;
":Good-hy, Irene. May God bless you, my&#xD;
dear little friend 1" , '         -    '&#xD;
He drew the face close to his own as thought&#xD;
he., would have kissed her, but forbore, and&#xD;
merely raising her hands to his lips, turned&#xD;
and left the room. Verily, greater is'he that&#xD;
ruleth his own spirit than he that taketh a&#xD;
city." He left before breakfast the ensuing&#xD;
morning, bearing his secret with him, having&#xD;
given no intimation, by word or look, of the&#xD;
struggle which his resolution cost him. Once&#xD;
his mother had fancied that he felt more than&#xD;
a friendly interest in their guest, but' the ab-&#xD;
solute repose of his countenance and grave&#xD;
serenity of his manner during the last week of&#xD;
his stay dispersed all her suspicions. From a&#xD;
luxurious home,, fond friends, and the girlish&#xD;
face he loved better than his life, the minister&#xD;
went forth to. his distantpost, offering in sacri-&#xD;
fice to God, upon the altar of Duty, his throb-&#xD;
bing heart and hopes of earthly happiness:&#xD;
A cloud of sadness settled on the household&#xD;
after his departure, and scarcely less than&#xD;
Louisa's ,was Irene's silent griet. The con-&#xD;
finement grew doubly irksome when his voice&#xD;
and step 'had passed f'rdin the threshold, and&#xD;
she looked forward impatiently to her release.'&#xD;
the sprain proved more serious than she had&#xD;
at first imagined, and the suunier vacation&#xD;
set in before she was able to walk with ease.'&#xD;
Mr. Huntingdon'had been apprised of her long&#xD;
absence from school, and one day, when she&#xD;
was cautiously trying her strength, hC arrived',&#xD;
without having given premonition of his visit.&#xD;
As he took he? in his arms and sharked the&#xD;
alteration in her thin face, the listlessness of&#xD;
her niander, the sorrowful gravity of her&#xD;
&#xD;
countenance, his fears were fully aroused, and,&#xD;
holding her to his heart, Ie-exclaimed:&#xD;
"My Daughter! Iny Beauty I 'I must take&#xD;
you out of New York."&#xD;
"Yes, Father, take' me home ; do take me&#xD;
home." She clasped her arms around his neck&#xD;
and nestled her face close to his.&#xD;
"'Not yet, Queen. We will go to the Cats-&#xD;
kill, to Lake George, to Niagara. - A few&#xD;
weeks' travel will invigorate you: I have&#xD;
written to Hugh to meet us at Montreal; he is&#xD;
with a gay 'party, and you.shall have a royal&#xD;
time. A pretty piece of business, truly, that'&#xD;
you can't amuse yourself in anly other way&#xD;
than by breaking half the bones in your body."&#xD;
"Father', I would rather go home. Oh I I&#xD;
am so tired of this city, so sick of that board-&#xD;
ing-school. Do, please, let me go back with&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" Oh, nonsense, Irene. Lift up youisleeve&#xD;
and let me see your arm; stretch it out,,; all&#xD;
right, I believe ; straight enough. You were&#xD;
walking just now ; how is your thot ?"&#xD;
"Almost well, I think; occasionally I have&#xD;
a twinge og pain when I bear my whole weight&#xD;
on it7-'&#xD;
" Be sure you do not overtax it for a while.&#xD;
-By Monday you will be able to start to Sara-&#xD;
toga. - Your aunt sent a trunk of clothing,&#xD;
and, by the way, here 'is a letter fron'her and.&#xD;
one from Arnold. The doctor worries con-&#xD;
siderably about you; is afl'aid you will not be.&#xD;
properly attended to."&#xD;
Thus the summer programme was determin-&#xD;
ed without any reference to the wishes of"the.&#xD;
one most concerned, and, knowing her father's&#xD;
disposition, she silently acquiesced. After&#xD;
much persuasion, .Mr. Huntingdon prevailed&#xD;
on Louisa's parents to allow her to accompany&#xD;
them. The mother consented very reluctant-&#xD;
ly, and on the appointed 'day the party set off&#xD;
for Saratoga.  .'he change was eminently&#xD;
beneficial, and before they reached Canada&#xD;
Irene seeized' perfectly restored.  But her&#xD;
father was not satisfied. Her unwonted taci-&#xD;
turnity annoyed and puzzled him; he knew&#xD;
that beneath the calm surface some strong un-&#xD;
dercurrent rolled swiftly, azid he'racked his&#xD;
brain to discover what had rendered her so re-&#xD;
served. Louisa's joyous, elastic spirits proba-&#xD;
bly heightened the effect of' her companion's&#xD;
gravity, and the contrast daily presented could&#xD;
not fail to arrest Mr. Hunuingdon's attentive.&#xD;
On arriving at Montreal the girls were left for&#xD;
a few moments in the parlor of the ,hotel,&#xD;
while Mr. Huntingdon went to register their&#xD;
names. Irene and Louisa-stood by the window&#xD;
.looking out into the street, when a happy,&#xD;
ringing voice exclaimed:'&#xD;
"ere you are, at last, Ir I I caught' a&#xD;
glipse of your curls da you passed the dinig-.&#xD;
room door."&#xD;
She turned to meet her cousin, and held out&#xD;
her hand. .&#xD;

MACARIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Does your majesty suppose I shall be sat-&#xD;
isfied with the tips of your fingers?  Pshaw,&#xD;
frie! I will have m'r kiss."&#xD;
He threw his -arm round her shoulder, 'Irew&#xD;
down the shielding hands, and. kissed her&#xD;
twice.&#xD;
" Oh, Hugh ! behave yourself! Miss Louisa&#xD;
Young,,'my -cousin, Hugh Seymour."&#xD;
.He bowed, and shook hands with the stran-&#xD;
ger, then seized his cousin's fingers and fixed&#xD;
.his fine eyes affectionately upon her.&#xD;
"'It seems an age since I saw you, Irie.&#xD;
Come, sit down and' let me look' at you; how&#xD;
stately- y'ou have, grown, to be surely More&#xD;
like a queen than ever; absolutely two inches&#xD;
taller since you entered boarding-school. Irie,&#xD;
I'am so glad to see you again !" .He snatched&#xD;
up a handful of curls and drew them across his.&#xD;
lips, careless of what Louisa might think.&#xD;
* Thank you, Hugh. I am quite as glad to&#xD;
see you."&#xD;
" Oh, humbtg ! I know better. You would&#xD;
rather see Paragon any day, ten to one. I&#xD;
will kill that dog yet, and. shoot Erebus, too;&#xD;
see if I don't ! then maybe you can think of&#xD;
somebody else. When you are glad you show&#xD;
t in your eyes, and now they are as still as&#xD;
violets under icicles.  I think you might love&#xD;
ine a little, at least as niuch as a dog."&#xD;
" Hush! I do love you, but I don't choose to&#xD;
tell it tp everybody in Montreal."'  I.1&#xD;
Mr. Huntingdon's entrance. diverted the&#xD;
conversation,-and Irene was glad to escape to&#xD;
her own room..&#xD;
"Your cousin seems to be very fond of you,"&#xD;
*observed Louisa, as she unbraided her hair.&#xD;
" He is very impulsive and demonstrative,&#xD;
,that is all."&#xD;
"How handsome he is !"&#xD;
" Do you think so, really ? Take care, Lou-&#xD;
isa! I will tell him, and, by way of crushing&#xD;
his vanity, add 'de gustibus, etc., etc., etc.'&#xD;
"How old is lie ?"&#xD;
" In his twentieth year."&#xD;
Fronthat time the cousins were thrown&#xD;
constantly together; whereverthey Went Hughl&#xD;
took charge of Irene, while Mr. Huntingdon&#xD;
.gave his attention to. Louisa., But the eagle-&#xD;
eye was upon his daughter's movements ; heY&#xD;
watched'her countenance, weighed her words,r&#xD;
tried to probe her heart. Week after week' t&#xD;
he found nothing tangible. Hugh..was gay,&#xD;
careless ; Irene equable, but reserved. Final- h&#xD;
ly they turned their faces. homeward, and in A&#xD;
October found themselves once more in New lI&#xD;
York. Mr. Huntingdon prepared to return a&#xD;
South and ,Hugh to sail for Europe, while f&#xD;
Irene remained at the hotel until the morning&#xD;
of her' cousin's departure '             ' e&#xD;
.A private parlor adjoined the room she og-&#xD;
oupied, and' here he camp to say farewell. She p&#xD;
knew that he had already had a long- conver- t&#xD;
eation-with her.father, and 'as' he threw -hims-&#xD;
self'.on the sofa gud seized one of 'her hands, F&#xD;
she imstmnctively shrank from him.&#xD;

&#xD;
" Irene, here is my miniature. I wanted&#xD;
you to ask for it, but I see that you 'won't'db&#xD;
it. I know very well that you will not value&#xD;
it one-thousandth part as much as I do yopr&#xD;
likeness here on my watch-chain; but perhaps&#xD;
it will remind you of me sometimes. How ;I&#xD;
shall want to see you before ,I cone hdome.!&#xD;
You know you belong to me.. Uncle gave you&#xD;
to me,'and when I come back from Europe we&#xD;
will be married. We are both very young'I&#xD;
know; but it has been settled so long. Irie,&#xD;
my beauty, I wish 'you would love me more;&#xD;
you are so cold. Won't you try'?"&#xD;
He leaned down to kiss her, but she turned&#xD;
her face hastily away and answered, resolute-&#xD;
ly:&#xD;
"No, I can't love you'other than as my&#xD;
cousin ; I would not, if!I could. I do not think&#xD;
it would be right, and I;won't promise to try.&#xD;
Father has no right ' to give me to you, orto&#xD;
anybody else. 'I tell you now I belong to my-&#xD;
silf, and only I can give myself away. Hugh,&#xD;
I don't consider this settled at all. You might&#xD;
as well know the truth at once; I have some&#xD;
voice in the matter."&#xD;
Mr. .Huntingdon had evidently prepared bim&#xD;
for something of this kind on her. part, and&#xD;
though his face flushed angrily, he took no no-&#xD;
tice of the remonstrance.&#xD;
"I shall write to you frequently, and I hope&#xD;
that you will be punctual. in replying. Ire,&#xD;
give me your left hand just a minute; wear this&#xD;
ring till I come, back, to remind you that you&#xD;
have a cousin across the, ocean."&#xD;
HIe tried to force the flashing jewel on her&#xD;
slender finger, but she resisted, and rose, strug-&#xD;
gling to withdraw her hand.&#xD;
"No, no, Hugh!. I can't; I won't. Know&#xD;
very well what that ring means, and I can not&#xD;
accept it. Release my hand; I tell you I won't&#xD;
wear it."&#xD;
"Come, Hugh; you have not a moment to&#xD;
spare ; the carriage is waiting." Mr. unting-&#xD;
don threw open, the door, having heard"everv&#xD;
word that passed. Hugh dropped the ring .in&#xD;
his vest.pocket and rose.&#xD;
Well.Irie, I suppose I must bid you fare-&#xD;
well. Two or three years will change you,&#xD;
my dearest little cousin. . Good-by; think of&#xD;
me now and then, and learn to love me by the&#xD;
line I come home."&#xD;
She suffered him to take both her hands and&#xD;
kiss her tenderly, for. her. father stood there&#xD;
and she'"could not refuse;,but the touch of'his&#xD;
ips burned long after he had gone. She put'&#xD;

she watched the form   hurrying a ong the&#xD;
- street below. The gas was already lighted&#xD;
on the crowded, highways of the *reat city,&#xD;
and the lamp just beneath the wine ow glared&#xD;
up like an electric eye.  She was dressed in&#xD;
half-mourning, in sober gray, with a black&#xD;
crape collar at the throat.  "There is no ex-&#xD;
quisite beauty without some strangeness .in&#xD;
the proportions," says Baron Verulam; and&#xD;
the strangeness ofElectra's countenance cer-&#xD;
tainly lay in the unusual width between the&#xD;
eyebrows.   Whatever significance learned:&#xD;
phrenologists or physiognomists attach to this'&#xD;
peculiarity, at all events it imparted piquancy&#xD;
to the features that I am striving to show you&#xD;
by that flaming gaslight.  Her watching at'&#xD;
titude denoted anxiety, and the bloom on her&#xD;
cheek had faded, leaving the whole face color-&#xD;
less. The lower lip was drawn under and&#xD;
.held hard and tight by the pearly teeth, while&#xD;
the wide-strained eyes-&#xD;
Shining eyes like antique jewels set in Parian statue-&#xD;
stone"--&#xD;
searched every face that passed the window.&#xD;
"..That hope deferred maketh the heart. sick,"&#xD;
she stood there in attestation ; yet it. was not&#xD;
passive sorrow-.printed on her countenance-&#xD;
rather the momentary, breathless exhaustion&#xD;
of a wild bird beating out its life in useless&#xD;
conflict with the unyielding wires of its cage.&#xD;
The dying hope, the despairing dread, in that&#xD;
fair young face beggars language, and as the&#xD;
minutes crept by the words burst from her&#xD;
lips: " Will he never, never come I".&#xD;
For three weeks she had received no letter&#xD;
from Russell; he was remarkably punctual,&#xD;
and this long, unprecedented interval filled&#xD;
her, at. first, -.with vague uneasiness, which&#xD;
grew finally into, horrible -foreboding. For&#xD;
ten days she had stood at this hour, at the'&#xD;

" No letter" had fallen, like the voice of doom,&#xD;
on her throbbing heart. " No letter !"-she&#xD;
heard it in feverish dreams, and fled continu-&#xD;
ally from its hissing. Only those who have&#xD;
known what it is to stake their hopes on a'&#xD;
sheet of letter-paper ; to wake at dawn, count-&#xD;
ing the hours, till the mail is due, working&#xD;
diligently to murder time .till that hour rolls&#xD;
round; to send a messenger, in hot haste, to&#xD;
watch the clock, giving him just so many&#xD;
minutes to go and come; to listen for the&#xD;
sound &amp;amp;f returning steps, to meet him at the&#xD;
door with 'outstretched hands, and receive-&#xD;
" rio letter;" only those who have writhed&#xD;
on this rack know the crushing thought with&#xD;
which thay pi-essed cold .hands .to aching&#xD;
hearts; "-anothei- twenty-four hours to be en-&#xD;
dured before the next mail comes in;i what&#xD;
shall I do till then ?" These are the trials.&#xD;
that plough wrinkles in smooth, girlish brons;-&#xD;
&#xD;
that harden the outline of soft rosy lips; that&#xD;
sicken the weary soul, and teach women&#xD;
dece tion. Electra knew that 'Mr. Clifton&#xD;
water ied her narrowly, suspiciously; an d be-.&#xD;
biind the mask of gay, rapid words,'and ring-&#xD;
ing, mirthless laughter, she tried to hide her&#xD;
suffering.. Ah ! God pity all who live from&#xD;
day to day hanging upon the brittle thread of&#xD;
hope   On this eleventh day suspense reached&#xD;
its acme, and time seemed to have loeke4 its&#xD;
wheels to lengthen her torture., Mr.- Clifton&#xD;
had been absent loner than usual., Most um-&#xD;
wittingly we are sometimes grand inquisitors,&#xD;
loitering by the way wien- waiting hearts are&#xD;
secretly, silently dropping blood. At last an&#xD;
omnibus stopped, and Mr. Clifton stepped&#xD;
out, with a bundle of papers under his, arm.&#xD;
Closer pressed the pallid face against the glass;&#xD;
firmer grew the grasp of the icy fingers on the&#xD;
brocatel; she had no strength to meet him.&#xD;
He closed the door, hung up his hat, and&#xD;
looked into the studio; no fire in the grate,&#xD;
no light in the gas-globes-everything cold&#xD;
and dark save the reflection on that front&#xD;
window.&#xD;
"Electra!"&#xD;
"I am here."&#xD;
"No letter."&#xD;
She stood motionless a moment ; but the&#xD;
brick walls opposite, the trees, the lamp-posts&#xD;
spun 'round, like maple leaves in an autumn&#xD;
gale. .&#xD;
" My owlet ! why don'syou have a light and&#xD;
some' fire ?"&#xD;
lHe stumbled toward her, and put his band&#xD;
on her shoulder, but she shrank away, and,&#xD;
lighting the gas, rang for coal.&#xD;
"There is something terrible the matter ;&#xD;
Russell is either ill or, dead. I must go'to&#xD;
him."&#xD;
. ."Nonsense'! sheer nonsense; he is busy,&#xD;
that is all. Your cousin has forgotten you for&#xD;
the time ; after a while he will write. .You&#xD;
are too exacting; -young men sometimes find&#xD;
constant, regular correspondence a bore; a&#xD;
letter every week is too, much to expect of&#xD;
him. Don't be childish, Electra."&#xD;
As she noticed the frown on his face, a dark&#xD;
suspicion seized her: " perhaps he had inter-&#xD;
cepted her letters."  Could he stoop to such&#xD;
an artifice ?&#xD;
" El.ectra, I would try to divert my mind.&#xD;
After all, his letters are short, and, I should&#xD;
'judge, rather unsatisfactory."&#xD;
" What do you know of the length or con-&#xD;
tents of hi letters ?"&#xD;
"I know they are brief, because I occasion-&#xD;
ally see them open in your hand; I judge that -&#xD;
they are unsatisfactory from the cloud on your&#xD;
face whenever they: come. But I have no&#xD;
disposition to contest the value of his .oosres-&#xD;
pondence with you. That article on chiar'o-&#xD;

quite chiaro-scuro enough, and to spare; but&#xD;
the smile on the artist's lipÂ§ stung her, and,&#xD;
without a word, she took a peat at his side and&#xD;
began to read. . Page after page was turned,&#xD;
tehnicalities si'pped through her lips,.but she&#xD;
understood as little'of the essay as if the lan-&#xD;
guage had been Sancrit instead of Sakon ; for,&#xD;
likt the deep, undying murmur of the-restless&#xD;
sea, -there rang in"her ears, V"No letter  no,&#xD;
letter, I" Ag she finished the pamphlet and&#xD;
threw iton the table, her hands dropped list-&#xD;
lessly in her lap.  Mr. Clifton was trying to&#xD;
read her countenance, and, impatient of his&#xD;
scrutiny, she rose to seek her own room, Just,&#xD;
then the doorbell rang sharply; she supposed&#xD;
it was some brother-artist comig to spend an&#xD;
hour, and turned to go.&#xD;
" Wait a minute; I want to---;" he paused,&#xD;
for at that instant she heard a voice which,&#xD;
even amid the din of Shinar, would have been&#xD;
unmistakable to her, and, breaking from him,&#xD;
she sprang to the threshold and met her cousin.&#xD;
" Oh, RussellI I thought you had forgotten&#xD;
me.".&#xD;
" What put such a ridiculous thought into&#xD;
your head ? My last letter must have prepared&#xD;
yoiu to expect me."&#xD;
"4What letter ? I have had none for three&#xD;
weeks."&#xD;
"One in which I mentioned Mr. Campbhll's&#xD;
foreign appointment, and the position of secre-&#xD;
tary which he tendered me.  Electra, let me&#xD;
speak to Mr. Clifton."&#xD;
As he advanced and greeted the artist she&#xD;
heard a quick, snapping sound, and saw the&#xD;
beautiful "Bohemian glass paper-cutter her&#xD;
guardian had been using lying, shivered to&#xD;
atoms, on the rug. The fluted handle was&#xD;
crushed in his fingers, and drops of blood oozed&#xD;
over the left hand. Ere she could allude to it&#xD;
he thrust his hand into his pocket and desired&#xD;
Russell to be seated.V&#xD;
" This is a pleasure 'totally unexpected.&#xD;
What is the appointment of 'which you&#xD;
spoke?"       '-..-&#xD;
" Mr. Campbell has been appointed Minister&#xD;
to   -  , and sails next week. I am sur-&#xD;
prised that'you have not heard of it from the&#xD;
public journals; many of them have spoken of&#xD;
it, and warmly commended the selection. I&#xD;
accompany him in the capacity of secretary,&#xD;
and shall, meanwhile, prosecute my studies&#xD;
under his direction."&#xD;
The gray, glittering eyes of the artist sought&#xD;
those of his pupil, and for an instant hers&#xD;
quailed ; but, rallying, she looked fully, stead-&#xD;
fastly at him, resolved to play out the game,&#xD;
scorning to bare her heart to his scrutiny.&#xD;
She had fancied that Russell's affection had&#xD;
prompted this visic; now it was apparent that&#xD;
he came to New York to 'take a; steamer, not&#xD;
to see her ; to put the 'stormy Atlantic between&#xD;
them. The foaming draught which she 'had&#xD;
snatched to her lips so eagerly, so joyfully,&#xD;
was turning to hemIeck as she ~tasted ; and&#xD;
&#xD;
though she silently put the cup from her, it was&#xD;
done smilingly ; -there were no wry faces, no&#xD;
gestures of disgust.&#xD;
" New York certainly agrees with you, Elec-'&#xD;
tra; you have grown and improved very much&#xD;
since you came North. I never saw such color&#xD;
in your cheeks before; Ican scarcely believe '&#xD;
that you are the same -fragile child I put into&#xD;
the stage one year ago. This reconciles me to,&#xD;
having, given you up to Mr. Clifton ; he is 'a&#xD;
better 'guardian than I could have been. But&#xD;
tell me something more about these new rela-&#xD;
tives you spoke of having found here.."&#xD;
Mr.- Clifton left the. room, and the two sat&#xD;
side by side for an hour, talking of the gloomy&#xD;
past, the flitting present, the uncertain future.&#xD;
Leaning back in his chair, with his eyes fixed'&#xD;
on the grate, Russell said, gravely:&#xD;
"There is now nothing to impede my sue-&#xD;
cessful career ; obstacles are rapidly melting&#xD;
away; every day brings me nearer the goal I&#xD;
long since set before me. In two years at&#xD;
farthest, perhaps earlier, I shall- return and.&#xD;
b egin the practice of law. Once admitted, I&#xD;
ask no more. Then, and not till then, I hope&#xD;
to save you from the necessity of labor; in the&#xD;
interim, Mr. Clifton will prove a noble and&#xD;
generous friend ; and believe me, my cousin,&#xD;
the thought .of leaving you so long is the only&#xD;
thing which will mar the pleasure of my Eu-'&#xD;
ropean sojourn."&#xD;
The-words were kind enough, but the tone&#xD;
was indifferent, and' the countenance showed&#xD;
her that their approaching separation disqui-&#xD;
eted him little. She thought of the sleepless&#xD;
nights and wretched days ehe had passed&#xD;
waiting for a letter from that tall, reserved,.&#xD;
cold cousin,.and her features relaxed in a de-&#xD;
risive smile at the'folly of her all-absorbing&#xD;
love. Raising his eyes accidentally he caught&#xD;
the smile, wondered what there was to call it&#xD;
forth in the plans-which he had just laid before&#xD;
her, and, meeting his glance of surprise, she,&#xD;
said, carelessly :&#xD;
" Are you not going'to see Irene before you&#xD;
sail T"&#xD;
His cheek flushed as he rose, straightened&#xD;
himself, and answered':&#xD;
"A strange question, truly, from one who&#xD;
knows me as well as you do. Call to see a&#xD;
girl whose father sent her from-home solely to&#xD;
prevent her from associating with my family ?&#xD;
Through what sort of metamorphosis do you&#xD;
.suppose that I have passed, that every spark&#xD;
of self-respect has been crushed out of me&#xD;
" Her father's tyranny and selfishness can&#xD;
never nullify her noble and affectionate remem-&#xD;
brance of Aunt Amy in'the hour of her need".&#xD;
"And when I am able' to repay her every&#xD;
cent we owe her, then, and not till then, I&#xD;
wish to see her. Things shall change ; mens ,.&#xD;
cujusque is est quisque; and the day will come&#xD;
when Mr. (Iuntingdon may not think it de-&#xD;
grading for',his daughter to acknowledge my&#xD;
acquaintance on the street."&#xD;
&#xD;
A brief silence ensued, Russell drew on his&#xD;
gloves, and' finally said, hesitatingly:&#xD;
" Dr.' Arnold told me she had suffered very&#xD;
much from a fall."&#xD;
" Yes ; for a long time she was confined to&#xD;
her room."&#xD;
" Has she recovered entirely ?".&#xD;
"Entirely. She grows more beautiful day&#xD;
by day.",&#xD;
Perhaps he wished to hearmore concerning&#xD;
her, but she would not gratify, him, and, soon&#xD;
after, he took up his hat.'&#xD;
" Mr. Cliftonhas a spare room, Russell; why&#xD;
can't you stay with us while you are in New.&#xD;
York ?"&#xD;
"Thank you; but Mr. Campbell will expect&#xD;
me at the hotel; I shall be needed, too, as he&#xD;
has many letters to write, I will see you to-&#xD;
morrow, and indeed every day while I remain&#xD;
iN the city."&#xD;
" Then pay your visits in the morning, for I&#xD;
want to take your portrait with my own hands.&#xD;
Give me a sitting as early as possible."&#xD;
"Very well; look for me to-morrow. Good-&#xD;
night."'&#xD;
The week that followed was one of strange-&#xD;
ly-mingled sorrows and joys ;'in after years it&#xD;
served as a prominent landmark to which she&#xD;
looked back and' dated sad changes in her&#xD;
heart. Irene remained ignorant of Russell's&#xD;
presence in the city, and at last the day&#xD;
dawned on which the vessel was to sail, At&#xD;
the breakfast-table Mr. Clifton noticed the&#xD;
colkelessness of his pupil's face, but kindly ab-.&#xD;
stained from any allusion to it. He saw that,&#xD;
contrary to habit,.she drank a cup of coffee,&#xD;
and, arresting her arm as -she requested his&#xD;
mother to give her a second, he said gently:&#xD;
" My dear child, where did you suddenly&#xD;
find such Turkish tastes? I thought you dis-&#xD;
liked coffee ?"&#xD;
"I take it now as medicine. My head aches&#xD;
horribly."&#xD;
"Then let me prescribe for you. We will&#xD;
go down to the steamer with Russell, and after-&#xD;
ward take a long ride ,to, Greenwood, if you&#xD;
like."                  re.o.    i&#xD;
" He said he would call here at ten o'clock&#xD;
to bid us farewell."&#xD;
"N'impo'te. ' The carriage will be ready,&#xD;
and we will accompany him."  '&#xD;
At the appointed hour they repaired to the&#xD;
vessel, and, looking at its huge sides, Electra&#xD;
coveted even a deck passage; envied the1&#xD;
meanest who hurried about, making all things&#xD;
ready for departure.  The last dell rang ;&#xD;
people. crowded down on the planks ;~Russell1&#xD;
hastened back to the carriage and took the&#xD;
nerveless gloved hand.&#xD;
" I will write as early as possible ; don't be-l&#xD;
uneasy about me ; no accident has ever hap-&#xD;
pened on this line. I am glad I leave you&#xD;
with such a friend as Mir. Clifton. Good-by,&#xD;
Cousin;.it will not be very long before we meet&#xD;
amn."&#xD;
&#xD;
He kissed the passive lips, shook hands with&#xD;
the artist, and sprang on aboard' just as the&#xD;
planks were withdrawn. The vessel moved&#xD;
majestically on its way; friends on'slore waged&#xD;
handkerchiefs to friends departing, and hands&#xD;
were kissed: and hats lifted, 'and then'the&#xD;
erowd'slowly dispersed,--for steamers'sa il eve y&#xD;
week, and people become accustomed t tfhe&#xD;
spectacle. .But to-day lit was freighted wjh&#xD;
the last fond hope of a deep and passionate&#xD;
nature; and as Electra gazed on the line'of'&#xD;
foam whitening the dull surface-of the water,&#xD;
the short-lived billows and deep hollows be-&#xD;
tween seemed newly-made graves, whose han-&#xD;
gry jaws had closed=for ever over the one&#xD;
bright lingering hope which' she had hugged to&#xD;
her heart.&#xD;
"Are you ready to go now ?" asked Mr.&#xD;
Clifton.&#xD;
" Yes, ready, q rite ready-for Greenwood."&#xD;
She spoke in a tone which had lost its liquid&#xD;
music, and with a wintry smile that fled over&#xD;
the ashy face,'lending the features no light, no,&#xD;
warmth.&#xD;
He tried to divert her mind by calling at-&#xD;
tention 'to various things of interest, but the&#xD;
utter exhaustion of her position and the mono-&#xD;
syllabic character of .her replies soon dis-&#xD;
-couraged him. Both felt relieved when the&#xD;
carriage stopped before' the studio, and as he&#xD;
led her up the steps he said, affectionately:&#xD;
"I am afraid my prescription has not 'ured&#xD;
your head."&#xD;
"No, sir; but I thank. you most. sincerely&#xD;
for the kind effort you have made to relieve&#xD;
m'e. I shall-'be better to-morrow. e Good-by&#xD;
till then."&#xD;
" Stay, my child. Come into-the studio, and&#xD;
let., me read something light, and pleasant to&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Not for the universe ! 'The sight of a book&#xD;
would give me brain-fever, I verily believe."&#xD;
She tried unavailingly to shake off his hand.&#xD;
" Why do, you shrink from me, my pupil ?"&#xD;
"Because I am sick, weary) and you-watch'&#xD;
me so, that I get restless and nervous. Do let&#xD;
me go ! I want to sleep."&#xD;
An impatient stamp emphasized the words,&#xD;
and, as he relaxed his clasp of her fingerp, she&#xD;
hastened to her room, and locked the door to&#xD;
prevent all intrusion.- Taking oftl ber bonnet&#xD;
she drew the heavy shawl closely around her&#xD;
shoulders and threw herself a ross the foot of&#xD;
the bed, burying her .facei her hands lest&#xD;
the bare walls should prove -witnesses of her&#xD;
agony . Six hours later she Alay there still,&#xD;
with pale fingers pressed to burning, dry eye-&#xD;
lids.&#xD;
Oh, bigotry of' human nature ! By what&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
Once more the labors of a twelvemonth&#xD;
had been. exhibited at'the Academy of Design&#xD;
-some to be classed among things "that were&#xD;
not born to die ;" others to fall into nameless&#xD;
graves. Many, who had worked faithfully, rec-&#xD;
ognizing the sacredness of their commission,&#xD;
had climbed higher in public estimation ; and&#xD;
a few, making mere pastime, or resting upon&#xD;
reputation already earned, had slipped back.&#xD;
Mr. Clifton ivas represented by an exquisite&#xD;
None, and on the same wall, in a massive&#xD;
oval frame, hung the first finished production&#xD;
of his pupil. For months after Russell's de-&#xD;
parture sh sat before her easel, slowly filling&#xD;
ap'the outline sketched' while his eyes watched&#xD;
her. She lingered over her work, loath to put&#xD;
the  finalstroke, calling continually upon&#xD;
Memory'to furnish the necessary details; and&#xD;
frequen , in recalling transient smiles, the'&#xD;
curl of 1is lip or bending of his brow; palette&#xD;
and brut would slip from her fingers, while&#xD;
she sat -eaving the broken yet priceless&#xD;
threads of a hallowed Past. Application some-&#xD;
times-trenqhes so closely upon genius as to be&#xD;
mistaken f r it in its results, and where both&#xD;
are happily blended the bud of Art expands&#xD;
in immortal. perfection. Electra spared no&#xD;
toil, and  it came to pass that the faultless&#xD;
head of her idol' excited intense and universal&#xD;
admiration. In the catalogue it was briefly&#xD;
mentioned as No. 17-a portrait; first effort of&#xD;
a young female artist." Connoisseurs, who&#xD;
had committed themselves by extravagant&#xD;
praise, sneered at the announcement of the&#xD;
catalogue, and, after a few inquiries, 'blandly&#xD;
&#xD;
MACARIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
asserted that no tyro could have produced it;&#xD;
that thesmasterhad wrought oitits perfection,&#xD;
and generously allowed the pupil to monopo.&#xD;
bze the encomiums. In vain Mr. Clifton dis.'&#xD;
claimed the merit, and asserted that he had&#xD;
never touched the canvas; that she had'jeal-&#xD;
ously refused-to let him aid her. Incredulous&#xD;
smiles and unmistakable motions of the.head&#xD;
were the sole results of his expostulation.&#xD;
Little nercy has a critical world for novices,&#xD;
particularly those clad in woman's garments;&#xD;
few helping hands are kindly stretched toward&#xD;
her trembling fingers, few strengthening words&#xD;
find her in her seclusion; and when these last&#xD;
do come in friendly whispers, are they not&#xD;
hung up "as apples of gold in pictures of sil-&#xD;
ver " along the chequered walls 'of memory'?&#xD;
Cold glances ,generally greet her earliest&#xD;
works; they are handled suspiciously, the&#xD;
beauties are all extracted, set in a row, and&#xD;
labelled  "plagiarisms-;" the  residue, like&#xD;
dross in crucibles, is handed back as "original,&#xD;
and  her_ undoubted  property."  Or, per-&#xD;
chance, . the phraseology  varies, and  she&#xD;
hears " This book, this statue, this picture,&#xD;
is no unpractised woman's work ; .we speak&#xD;
advisedly, and pronounce the fact that pen,&#xD;
or rasp, or chisel, or brush, belongs unmis-&#xD;
takably to a master-an experienced writer&#xD;
or veteran artist."  It is. this bent of hu-&#xD;
man nature to load with chaplets well-estab-&#xD;
lished. favorites of fame, to "whitewash"&#xD;
continually with praise, to jealously withhold&#xD;
the meed of beginners, rendering .ruidgingly&#xD;
" Casar's things to Casar," which 'tips uaany&#xD;
a pen with gall, and shadows noble pictures&#xD;
with unseemly clouds. Electra was indignant&#xD;
at the injustice meted out to her, and, as&#xD;
might have been expected, rebelled against&#xD;
the verdict. Very little consolation was de-&#xD;
rived from the argument by which her master&#xD;
strove to mollify her-that the incredulity of&#xD;
the critics was the highest eulogy that could&#xD;
have been pronounced upon her work. Some&#xD;
weeks after the close of. the' exhibition the&#xD;
iEnone was purchased and the portrait sent&#xD;
home.. Electra placed it on the easel once&#xD;
more,'and stood before it in rapt contempla-&#xD;
tion. Down from- the arched roof flowed bil-&#xD;
lows of, light, bathing her rounded form as in&#xD;
a sea of molten topaz, and kindling a start-&#xD;
ling, almost unearthly, beauty in the canvas'&#xD;
What mattered the brevity and paucity of&#xD;
Russell's letters now ?-what though Three&#xD;
thousand miles of tempestuoussea roared and&#xD;
tossed between them ?-she.had his untarhish-&#xD;
ed image in her heart, his life-like features&#xD;
ever before her. To this shrine she came&#xD;
continually, and laid thereon the offering of a.&#xD;
love passionate and worshipping as ever took&#xD;
entire possession of a woman's heart. Cold-&#xD;
ness, silence, neglect, all were forgotten when&#xD;
she looked into the deep, beautiful eyes, apil&#xD;
upon the broad, bold, matchless brow'.&#xD;
&#xD;
.           .    Love is notlove  .&#xD;
which alters, when it alteration finds,&#xD;
Or bends with the reinover to renove,&#xD;
Oh. no? it is an ever-fixed mark,&#xD;
-That looks on tempests and is never shaken."&#xD;
She had not the faintest hope that he would&#xD;
ever cherish a tenderer feeling for her ; but&#xD;
love is a plant of strange growth: now lifting&#xD;
its head feebly in rich, sunny'spots, where&#xD;
every fostering influence is employed ; and&#xD;
now springing vigorous from barren, rocky&#xD;
cliffs, clinging in icy crevices, defying every&#xD;
adverse element, sending its fibrous roots&#xD;
deeper and deeper in us genial soil; bending&#xD;
before the fie'ce, breath of storms, only to&#xD;
erect itself more firmly ; spreading its delicate&#xD;
petals over the edges of eternal snow, self-sus-&#xD;
taning, invincible, immortal. A curious plant&#xD;
truly,.and one which will not bear transplant-&#xD;
ing, as many a-luckless experiment 'has proved.&#xD;
To-day, as Electra looked upon her labors, the&#xD;
coils'of Time seemed to fall away; the vista&#xD;
of Eternity opened before 'her, peopled with&#xD;
two forms, which on earth walked widely sepa-&#xD;
rate -paths, and over her features stole a serene,'&#xD;
lifted expression, as if, after painful scaling,&#xD;
she had risen above the cloud-region 'and&#xD;
caught the first rays of perpetual sunshine.&#xD;
Tiie, like a weaver, made strange, dim,&#xD;
confused masses . of woof and warf; but in&#xD;
Eternity the eirthwork would be turned, and&#xD;
delicate tracery and marvellous coloring, di-'&#xD;
vine gobelins, would come to light. Patience !&#xD;
Away from the loom-let the shuttle 'fly !&#xD;
" What I do thou knowest not now, but thou&#xD;
shalt know hereafter."  Hence to thy,barren&#xD;
field's, and till them until the harvest.&#xD;
Mr. Clifton had watched her for some.mo-&#xD;
ments, with lowering brow and jealous {hatred&#xD;
of the picture. Approaching, he looked over&#xD;
her shoulder and asked:.&#xD;
" How much longer do you intend to stand.&#xD;
here ?  Pygmalion was not more captivated&#xD;
by his ivory image than you are-by your head.&#xD;
Were it Antinous or Apollo, I doubt whether,&#xD;
your admiration would be enhanced."&#xD;
"It is more than.Antinous and Apollo," she&#xD;
answered, drawing the folds of silk over the&#xD;
portrait and turning toward him.&#xD;
" Child, you are an idolatress."&#xD;
"Perhaps so; but, at least, I am in a goodly&#xD;
company. Many bow down before shrines of&#xD;
their own hlindiwork ; some bring libations to&#xD;
Mammon, some to Fame, some to Ambition,&#xD;
some to Love. Nature intended us to kneel,&#xD;
which- is preferable to standing, statue-like,.&#xD;
exacting obeisance. from others. Which is'&#xD;
nobler ? But how am I an idolatress? Shall'&#xD;
1 not prize the features of my cousin, my, ear-&#xD;
liest friend and playmate.?  Would you have&#xD;
mue tear off and cast away the-kindly emotions,&#xD;
the warm affectiguhs wherewith God clothed&#xD;
me, as badges of humanity ?"&#xD;
" By no means. But would you have a&#xD;
secoiid Ixion's wheel ?" .&#xD;
" Aye;-sir, when I am weak enough to wor-&#xD;
&#xD;
:59&#xD;
&#xD;
ship a. cloud. Mr. Clifton, I believe I, have&#xD;
shaken hands with my' rosy-cheelied, sunny-&#xD;
eyed, siren-charmed childhood ; -atid, to-day,&#xD;
standing here a woman, with few tics to bind&#xD;
me to my fellow-creatures, I boll this one&#xD;
jewelled link of the past in the hollow of my&#xD;
hand, and pet it. Why not ? Oh, -why not.?&#xD;
I am but. seventeen ;~this is all that 7 have&#xD;
left to caress, and soon the waves of dom-&#xD;
ing years 'will wash this, too4 thi'ough imy&#xD;
fingers. Would you, less merciful than time,&#xD;
snatch it from me prematurely ?"&#xD;
"I would, that in exchange I might heap&#xD;
your hands with untold treasure and joy."&#xD;
" I think I am less grasping, then,. than you.&#xD;
Leave me the little I value'; I ask no more,&#xD;
wish no more, will have no more."&#xD;
She would shave left him, but his hand fell&#xD;
heavily on hers.&#xD;
"Electra, I must speak to you; hear me.&#xD;
You bug a phantom to your heart; 'Russell&#xD;
does pot and will not love you, other 'than as&#xD;
his cousin."&#xD;
The blood deserted her face, leaving a grag-&#xD;
ish pallor, but the eyes sought his steadily, and&#xD;
the rippling voice lost none of its rich ca-&#xD;
dence.&#xD;
" Except as his cousin, I do not expect Rus-&#xD;
sell to love me."&#xD;
" Oh, child! you deceive yourself; this is a&#xD;
hope that-youeling to with,mad tenacity."&#xD;
She wrung her hand from his, and drew her&#xD;
figure to its utmost height.&#xD;
"You' transcend your privilege, sir, when&#xD;
you attempt to catechise me thus. I deny'the&#xD;
right of any on earth to put such:questions to&#xD;
me-to'make such assertions."&#xD;
" Electra, I did not mean to offend you, but&#xD;
the time has come when we iust understand&#xD;
each dther -    ' - ."&#xD;
" You did not mean to offend me-'well, let&#xD;
that pass; another day we will discuss it, 'if&#xD;
you please," she interrupted,'waving him off&#xD;
and turning toward the door.&#xD;
"No; you must hear me now. I have a&#xD;
right to question you--the right of my long,&#xD;
silent, faithful love. You may deny 'it, but&#xD;
that matters little ; be still, and listen. Did&#xD;
you suppose that I was'simply a generous man,  -'&#xD;
when-I offered to guard and aid you-when I&#xD;
took you to my house, placed you in my moth-&#xD;
er's care, and lavished affection upon you?&#xD;
Did you dream that I was disinterested in&#xD;
what I 'have done to encourageand assist you,?&#xD;
Did you imagine I was merely an, amiable&#xD;
philanthropist, anxious to help all in difficulty&#xD;
and sorrow? 'If' so, 'put', away the hallucina-&#xD;
tion. Consider me no longer your friend ;&#xD;
look at me as I am, a jealous and selfishly ex-&#xD;
actinrg man, who stands before you to'dy and&#xD;
tells you he loves you.' Oh, Electra! From&#xD;
the morning when you first showed me your&#xD;
sketches, yosthave'beeh more than my life to&#xD;
me. -An uncomnerable love sprang up then,&#xD;
and it has grown with the months and yea.,.&#xD;

&#xD;
taking sole possession of a heart which never&#xD;
bowed before any other woman. Every hope&#xD;
I'ave centres in you. I have not deceived&#xD;
myself; I knew that you loved Russell. Nay,&#xD;
don't deny it; I have watched you too long not&#xD;
to robe your mask. I knew that he had .your&#xD;
grish love but I waited, and hoped my de-&#xD;
votio would win you. You were but a child,&#xD;
and I thought the depth and fervor of my&#xD;
affection would out-weigh a childish fancy.&#xD;
When he came here, I saw that the old fasci-&#xD;
nation still -kept its hold upon you ;' but I saw,&#xD;
too, what you saw quite as plainly-that in&#xD;
Russell Aubrey's heart there is-room for noth-&#xD;
in  but ambition. I knew how you suffered,&#xD;
and .I believed it was the death-struggle of&#xD;
your love. But instead, I find you, day by&#xD;
day, before that easel-oblivious of me, of&#xD;
everything but the features you cling to so&#xD;
insanely. Do you wonder that I hate that&#xD;
portrait?  Do you wonder that I am growing-&#xD;
desperate ?  Where is your womanly pride,&#xD;
that you lavish your love on one totallyindif-&#xD;
ffrent to you? Strange paradox that you&#xD;
arel--proud, passionate, exacting, and yet&#xD;
clinging madly to a memory. Have you no&#xD;
-     mercy, that you (loom me to, live for ever on&#xD;
the rack.?  Shall yonder piece of canvas al-&#xD;
ways stand between your heart and mine ?  If&#xD;
heloved you in return, I could bear it better';&#xD;
but as it is, Iain torturso4 beyJnd all endurance.&#xD;
I have: spent nearly three years. in trying to&#xD;
gain your heart ; all other aims have faded be-&#xD;
fore this one absorbing love. To-day I lay it&#xD;
at 'your feet, and asf if I have not earned&#xD;
some reward. Oh, Electra! have you no&#xD;
gratitude ?"&#xD;
A scarlet spot burned on his pale cheeks, and&#xD;
the mild liquid gray eyes sparkled like stars;&#xD;
It was no startling revelation to her ; long&#xD;
before she had'seen that this hour of trial must&#xD;
come to both, ,and now, despite her resolution,&#xD;
his words unnerved her. She dared not look&#xD;
atihim ; the hollow voice told her too well what&#xD;
effect thisexcitement was working on his&#xD;
feeble frame.&#xD;
"Oh,'Mr. Clifton ! Iam grateful; God, who&#xD;
sees my 'heart, knows that I am. No child&#xD;
ever.loved a parent better than I love you."&#xD;
"It is not filial affection that I ask of you&#xD;
now. I beg you to lay your dear -hands in&#xD;
mine,andepromise to be my wife.a hask this&#xD;
yof'ybu in the name of my devoti  You gave&#xD;
yourself to me years ago, and t -d y I beseech&#xD;
you to seal the compact by a  nal Vromise.&#xD;
Electra, beware how you answer ! Bridge the'&#xD;
lf between us. Give me your hand."&#xD;
He stretched out his hand, .but she drew&#xD;
back a step.&#xD;
" God forgive mel! but I have no such love.&#xD;
for yu."  -        '.-&#xD;
A ghastly smile -broke over his face and,&#xD;
.after a moment, 'the- snowy handkerchief'he&#xD;
passed across his lips was stained with ruby&#xD;
streaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I know that, and I know the reason. But,&#xD;
once more 1' ask you 'to give me your hand.&#xD;
'Electra, dearest, do not, I pray you, refuse me&#xD;
this.' Oh, child! give me your hand, and in&#xD;
time you will learn to love me."&#xD;
He seized her fingers, and stooped his head&#xD;
till the silky brown' beard mingled with her&#xD;
raven locks.&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton,.to marry without love would&#xD;
be a grievous sin; I dare not., We would&#xD;
hate eaoh 'other. Life would be a curse to&#xD;
both, and death a welcome release. Could you&#xD;
endure a wife who accepted your hand' from&#xD;
gratitude and pity?  Oh ! such a'relationship&#xD;
would be horrible'beyond all degree. I shud-&#xD;
der at the thought."&#xD;
" But you would learn to love me."&#xD;
The summer wind shook 'the window-cur-&#xD;
tains and rustled the folds of black silk till&#xD;
the drapery slid from the portrait and leftit&#xD;
fully exposed to view. . She gave one quick&#xD;
glance at the beloved countenance, and, fall-&#xD;
ing on her knees before the easel, raised her&#xD;
clasped hands passionately, and exclaimed:&#xD;
"Impossible! impossible'! You have said&#xD;
that he is my idol, and you make no mistake.&#xD;
He fills my heart so entirely, that I have&#xD;
nothing 'but reverence' and gratitude to offer&#xD;
you. I am young, I know, and you think that&#xD;
this is a girlish fancy which will fade witly com-&#xD;
ing years. I tell you, sir, this love has become&#xD;
part of me. When he went to Europe I said,-&#xD;
' I will tear it out of 'my heart, and forget him;&#xD;
I will give every thought to my noble Art.'&#xD;
Faithfully I strove to do so ; but a little moun&#xD;
tain-stream once merged in the pathless ocear,&#xD;
might as well struggle to gather back-its tiny&#xD;
wavelets and return to its pebbly channel. I&#xD;
am proud ; it humiliates 'nie to acknowledge&#xD;
all this; and nothing on earth could wring ,it&#xD;
from me but my desire to convince you that&#xD;
'it is utterly impossible I can ever love you as&#xD;
you ask.&#xD;
'-1 lift my heavy heart up solemnly,&#xD;
As on e lectra her sepulchral un,&#xD;
And: looking in thine eyes, I overturn'&#xD;
The ashes at thy feet. Behold, and see&#xD;
what a great heap of grief, lay hid in me,&#xD;
And how the red wild sparkles dimly burn&#xD;
Through the ashen grayness. If thy fout in scorn&#xD;
could tread them out to darkness utterly,&#xD;
-It miaht be well, perhaps."&#xD;
But you can not take Russell's' place. None&#xD;
can come between him and my heart."&#xD;
The yellow light dripped down on her&#xD;
purplish hair, crystalizing -into a nimbus, as&#xD;
she knelt before the portrait, lifting her hands,&#xD;
like saints.in medieval pictures, fleeing from,&#xD;
martyrdom. Shame dyed. her cheeks, but'&#xD;
desperate, reckless triumph flashed in the 'up-&#xD;
raised eyes, revealingo' fully the aversioni which&#xD;
'his suit 'had inspireY.'- Unfortunate, deplora-&#xD;
ble as was her love for a cousin, it seemed'&#xD;
for the momnt to glorify her, and 'Mr.' Clif-&#xD;
ton piut his hand over his eyes to shut out the&#xD;
vision. .,&#xD;
&#xD;
"Electra Grey, you are unwomanly in your&#xD;
unsought love."&#xD;
She turned her head, and, looking over her&#xD;
shoulder at him, smiled derisively.&#xD;
" Unwomanly ! If so, made such by your&#xD;
unmanliness. Unwomanly I I deny it. Which&#xD;
is most womanly-to yield, to the merciless&#xD;
importunity of one"to whom I am -indebted ;&#xD;
to give my hand to him whose touch chills the&#xD;
blood in my veins ; to promise to become -his&#xD;
wife when the bare thought sickens my soul ;&#xD;
to dare to stand before God's. altar and take&#xD;
false vows on my 'lips, or to 'tell the simple&#xD;
truth ? to shield myself from his' entreaties,&#xD;
under the holy mantle-of a deep,-undying love&#xD;
for another ? I volunteered no confession; you&#xD;
taxed and taunted me with my affection. Sir,,&#xD;
.it should have made me sacred in your eyes.&#xD;
Unwomanly 1 Were you more -manly, I had&#xD;
never shocked your. maudlin sentiments of&#xD;
propriety."&#xD;
"And this is my reward for all the tender-&#xD;
ness I have lavished on you! Wlien I stooped&#xD;
to beg your hand, to be repulsed with scorn&#xD;
and loathing. To spend three years in faith-j&#xD;
ful effort to. win . your heart, and reap  -&#xD;
contempt, hatred." -&#xD;
Staggering back, he sank into his arm-chair,&#xD;
and closed his eyes a montent, then continued:&#xD;
'4 If it were possible' that-you could be hap-&#xD;
py, I would not complain ; but there is no&#xD;
nope of that. You ought as 'well kneel to my&#xD;
marble Hermes yonder anto Russell. Stranger&#xD;
int'atuation never possessed a woman."&#xD;
" I am not blind; I neither ask nor expect&#xD;
anything from him. Unless you betray my,&#xD;
confidence he will never suspect the truth,&#xD;
and bIwould sooner endure the tortures of&#xD;
Torquemada; than that he should know it.&#xD;
But by what process will you demonstrate&#xD;
that,'since a rare and royal banquet is for ever&#xD;
shut beyond my reach, it is my duty to sit&#xD;
down in the dust and try to content anyself&#xD;
with husks?  Sir,mny God never intended me&#xD;
to live on' crumbs, and 'I will not. 'I will be&#xD;
true to my heart; if the vast host of i'ny fel-&#xD;
low-creatures should pass away from earth, I&#xD;
will stand alone and conquer solitude as best'&#xD;
I may. Not 'one jot, nut one tittle' of my&#xD;
'nature will I yield for companionship. No&#xD;
mess of pottage will I have, in lieu of my&#xD;
birthright. All or mone ! Marriage is holy ;&#xD;
God, in his wisdom, institutedit with the seal&#xD;
of' love ; ' but its desecration with counterfeits&#xD;
makes Tophets, Golgothas instead of Edens.&#xD;
I know wuat I have to expect ; on my own&#xD;
head be my future. If quarrel there be, it is&#xD;
between Fate and me ; you have no oncern in&#xD;
it."&#xD;
'"I would not have troubled you long, Elec-&#xD;
tra. it ivas because 1 knew that my life must&#xD;
teshort at best that I urged you to gild the&#xD;
brief period with tike 'light of your love. 'I&#xD;
would not have bound you always'to ne ; and,&#xD;
when I asked your hand a few minutes sine,&#xD;
&#xD;
I knew that death would soon sever the tie and,&#xD;
set you free.' Let this sufficesto, palliate my&#xD;
'unmanly' pleading. I have but.one request,&#xD;
to make of you now, and, weak a itiay see,.&#xD;
d beg of you not, to deny 'me. 'on, are pre-&#xD;
paring to leave my house ; this .I know.; 1 see&#xD;
it in your face, and the thought is harrowing to&#xD;
me. Electra, remain under my roof while :I&#xD;
live; 'let me see you every day, here, in 'my&#xD;
hMuse.' It' not ;as my wife, stay as my friend,&#xD;
my pupil, my child. I little thought I coild&#xD;
ever condescend to ask, this of any one; but&#xD;
the dread of separation bows me down. Oh,&#xD;
child ! I will not clain you long."&#xD;
She stood up before him with the portrait&#xD;
in her arms, resolved, then and there, to leave&#xD;
him for ever. But the ghastly pallor of his&#xD;
face, the scarlet thread oozimg over his lips&#xD;
and saturating the handkerchief with which&#xD;
he strove 'to staunch it, told her that the re-&#xD;
quest was preferred on -no idle 'pretext. -In&#xD;
swift review, his kindness, generosity and un-'&#xD;
wavering affection passed before her, and the&#xD;
mingled accents ;o1 remorse and compassion&#xD;
whispered: 'Pay your debt of gratitude by&#xD;
sacrificing ydur heart. If you cad make him&#xD;
happy, you owe it to him."&#xD;
Without a word she 'passed him and went&#xD;
up to her own room. It was an hour of sore&#xD;
temptation for one so young and inexperienced;&#xD;
but, placing the portrait on 'the low mantle,&#xD;
she crossed her arms before it and tried to lay&#xD;
matters in the scale. On one side, years 'of&#xD;
devotion, the circumstances of tif artist's life,&#xD;
his mother's infirmity, confining her sometimes&#xD;
to her bed, often to her room, preventing her&#xD;
from nursing him; the weary season, of' his&#xD;
tedious illness, the last hours gloomy and mis-&#xD;
erable, unsoothed by gentle words or tender&#xD;
offices: On the other, stern adherence, un-&#xD;
errimg obedience to- the dictates of her heart,&#xD;
the necessary self-abnegation, the patient' 'at..&#xD;
tendance at the couch ot prolonged suffering,&#xD;
and entire devotion to him. For a time the&#xD;
scales balanced ; she could not conquer her re-"&#xD;
pugnance to, remaining in his home; theoi a&#xD;
grave and its monumental stone were added,&#xD;
and, with a groan, she dropped her face'in het&#xD;
hanils. At the expiration of' two hours she.&#xD;
locked the.portraitfrom view, and went-slew-&#xD;
ly back to 'the studio. ,The house was' very&#xD;
quiet; the ticking of the clock was distinctly&#xD;
heard as she pushed the door open and glided&#xD;
in.  Involuntarily she drew  a long, 'deep&#xD;
breath, for it was like leaving freedom at.the&#xD;
threshold and taking upon herself grieeua&#xD;
bonds. The arm-chair-was vacant, but the&#xD;
artist lay on one .of the sofas, with his fpe&#xD;
toward the wall, and on asmall table beside hy'&#xD;
stood a crystal bowl ofcracked ice, a  atiod&#xD;
wine-glass,. and 'vial contaittizg 'somne, dhr&#xD;

now and then, as if striving to suppress bitter.&#xD;
words.' The beautiful brown hair was all&#xD;
tossed; back, and she noticed that along 'the&#xD;
fQrehead clustered many silver threads. One&#xD;
hand was 'thrust within his.vest, the other,&#xD;
thrown .up over .the head, grasping a fresh&#xD;
handkerchief.; Softly she took this hand, and,&#xD;
bending over him, said, sin a low, thrilling&#xD;
tone:&#xD;
- A Mr. Clifton, I was passionate and 'hasty,&#xD;
an4 said some unkind things which I would&#xD;
fain recall, and 'for which I beg your pardon.&#xD;
I thank you for the honor you would have&#xD;
conferred on me,'and for the unmerited love&#xD;
you offered me. Unless it were jn my power to&#xD;
return that love, it would be sinful to give you&#xD;
my hand ; but, since you desire it so earnestly,&#xD;
1. iill promise to stay by your side, to do what&#xD;
1 can to make you happy; to prove, by my de-&#xD;
''votion, that I amr not insensible to all your&#xD;
kindness, that I am very grateful for the affiec-&#xD;
tion you have given me. I come and offer&#xD;
you this, as a poor return for all that I owe&#xD;
you; it is the most my conscience will permit&#xD;
me to tender. My friend, my master, will you&#xD;
accept it, and forgive the pain and sorrow I&#xD;
have caused you ?"&#xD;
He felt her tears falling'on his fingers, and,&#xD;
for a mlonmwnt, neither spoke ; then lie drew&#xD;
the bands to his lips and kissed them tenderly.&#xD;
"Â«Thank you, Electra. I 'know it is a sac-&#xD;
rifice on your part, but I am selfish enough to&#xD;
accept it. Ileaveni bless you, my pupil."&#xD;
" i future we will not allude t) this day of;&#xD;
trial-let it be forgotton; *let the dead past&#xD;
bury its dead.' I will have no resurrected.&#xD;
phantoms. Awl now, sir, you must not allow&#xD;
this slight' heimorrhage to depress you. In a&#xD;
few days you will be stronger, quite able to&#xD;
examine' andu find fault with my work. .Shall&#xD;
1 send a note to Dr. LeRoy, asking him to call&#xD;
and see you this evening ?"&#xD;
"6He has jqat. left me. Say nothing of the&#xD;
hemorrhage to mother ; it would only distress&#xD;
-her."&#xD;
He released her hands, and, stooping over&#xD;
his illow, she smoothed the disordered hair,&#xD;
and for the first time pressed her lips to his&#xD;
forehead.&#xD;
Thus she bowed her neck to the yoke, and,&#xD;
with a fixed, unalterable will, entered on the'&#xD;
long, dreary ministry to which she felt that&#xD;
duttycalled-&#xD;
We shade our eyes, and peer into the dim&#xD;
known, striving to see whither we are tend-&#xD;
ingand a 'sudden turn in the way, a sharp&#xD;

the direction to which our'inclinations point.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
" Cities give not the human senses. room&#xD;
enough," says a latter-day seer, and Electra&#xD;
Grey sometimes felt-that. heroheart and soul&#xD;
were in the-stocks, or ironed down to a stake,&#xD;
leaving only a periphery of a few feet. Brick&#xD;
walls and paving-stones uttered no kindly&#xD;
message; hurrying loot-passengers and crowd-&#xD;
ed omnibuses told.of the din and strife of life,&#xD;
but whispered no word of cheer, no lesson of&#xD;
uncomplaining fortitude, no exhortation to be&#xD;
strong and patient. She aiw colossal Selfish-&#xD;
ness crushing along its Jaggernautic .way;&#xD;
Wealth jostled Poverty into the gutter, and&#xD;
Beauty picked a dainty crossing to give a wide&#xD;
berth to Deformity ; hard, stern, granite-like&#xD;
faces passed her window day by day; princely..&#xD;
,equipages, with haughty, supereihousios  ecu-&#xD;
pants, rolled along the street, and bridal trains&#xD;
and funeral processions mingled in their wimd-&#xD;
ings. If man be, indeed, a ."nicrocosm," 'to&#xD;
what shall I liken that .great city wherein&#xD;
dwelt, the painter and his pupil ?  Isis, the&#xD;
great nursing-mother-genial Nature, teeming&#xD;
with soothing influences, and missals of' joy&#xD;
and strength, seemed sepulchred-and in her&#xD;
place, a flint-featured, miserly, and most in-&#xD;
tolerable step-mother frowned upon the luck-&#xD;
less young artist. Citylife ! City starvation,&#xD;
rather, she found it, until a long and painful.&#xD;
apprenticeship taught her the priceless alche-&#xD;
my whereby smiling Plenty beamed upon her.&#xD;
Reared on the outskirts ofla cointry-town, she&#xD;
longed for the freedom and solitude of the old&#xD;
pine-woods at home, and, sickened at the&#xD;
thought of spending her life within walls of&#xD;
brick and mortar. .She had selected an attic&#xD;
room; with dormer windows looking eastward,&#xD;
and here she daily watched the pale gray'&#xD;
dawn struggle with the vapors and shadows of&#xD;
night. " Quiet fields of crimson cirri," fleecy&#xD;
masses. of restless, glittering cumuli, or the,&#xD;
sweep and ruslh of "inky-tringed," lowering&#xD;
rain-clouds, alike charmed her. Long before&#xD;
the servants stirred below she was seated at&#xD;
the window, noting the waning. shimmer, of&#xD;
the Morning-Star as the waves of light rolled&#xD;
up and crested the horizon, whitening the&#xD;
deep dark blue with their sparkling spray.'&#xD;
The peculiarities- of each sunrise and sunset&#xD;
were jotted down assiduously :.&#xD;
"Cloud-waits ofrthe morning's'gray&#xD;
-  '    Faced with amber coluimit,&#xD;
Crowned witli crinisn cupola&#xD;
From a sunset solemn,"'-&#xD;
were-sketche'd with great ere, and put aside&#xD;
for future use; and it rarely happened that, on&#xD;
a dull, rainy morning, she came down to break-&#xD;
fast looking other than moody and disappoint-&#xD;
ed, as though her. rights had been infringed,&#xD;
her priyileges curtailed. Constituted with&#xD;
keen susceptibility to impressionis of beauty or&#xD;
sublimity, whether physical, moral, or intellec-&#xD;
tual, Nature intended her as a thing for sun-&#xD;
&#xD;
shine and holidays, as a darlg to be petted;&#xD;
but Fate shook her head, and, with a grimace,&#xD;
set the tender young,soul'on a bleak exposure,:&#xD;
to be hardened and invigorated.&#xD;
With the 'characteristic fitfulness of con-&#xD;
sumption,-Mr. Clifton rallied, and, for a time,&#xD;
seemed almost restored; but at the approach&#xD;
of Winter the cough increased, and dangerous&#xD;
symptoms returned. Several months after the&#xD;
rejection of his suit, to which no allusion had&#xD;
ever been made, Electra sat before tier easel,&#xD;
absorbed in work,' while the master slowly&#xD;
walked up and down the studio, wrapped in a&#xD;
warm plaid shawl.  Occasionally he paused&#xD;
and looked over her shoulder, then resumed&#xD;
his pace, offering no comment. It was not an&#xD;
unusual occurrence for them to pass entire&#xD;
mornings together without exchanging a word,&#xD;
and to-day the silence had lasted more than&#xD;
an hour. A prolonged fit of coughing finally&#xD;
arrested her attention, and, glancing up, she&#xD;
met his sad gaze.&#xD;
"This- is unpropitious weather for you, Mr.&#xD;
Clifton."&#xD;
"Yes, this winter offers a dreary prospect."&#xD;
"There is the doctor now, passing the win-&#xD;
dow.   I will come back as soon as his visit is&#xD;
over." She rose hastily to quit the room, but&#xD;
he detained her.&#xD;
" Do not go-I wish you to remain and fin-&#xD;
ish your work." '&#xD;
Dr. LeRoy entered, and, after questioning&#xD;
his patient, stood on the rug, warming his ,&#xD;
fingers.'&#xD;
The fact is,my dear fellow, this is not the'&#xD;
place for you. I sent.you South four yearsI&#xD;
ago nearly, and saved yot ' life;i and, as I toldI&#xD;
you last- week, you will have to take that'sameI&#xD;
prescription again. It is folly to talk of spend-l&#xD;
ang the winter here. I can do nothing fort&#xD;
you. You must go to Cuba or toItaly. It is,&#xD;
of no use to try to deceive you, Harry ; you&#xD;
know, just as well as I do,'that your case is get-&#xD;
ting desperate, and change of climate is your&#xD;
last hope. I have told you all this before."&#xD;
Electra laid down her pallette, and listened&#xD;
for the answer...&#xD;
" I am sorry you'think so, but I can't leave t&#xD;

' " Why not ?"&#xD;
"For various good reasons."&#xD;
" My dear fllow, is your life of any value ?"e&#xD;
"Astrange question,'truly."    '&#xD;
"If it is, quit New York in thirty-six hours;&#xD;
if . not, remain, 'for various good reasons.'a&#xD;
Send to- my office for an anodyne. Better&#xD;
take myadvice. Good-day."                s&#xD;
Passing by the easel, he 'whispered:&#xD;
"Use) our influence; send him South." .And'&#xD;
then the two were again alhne.           s&#xD;
.Resting-her chin in her hands, she raised her&#xD;
eyes and said: l&#xD;
" Why do you not follow the doctor's' ad- I&#xD;
vice ? A winterr South might restore you." .&#xD;
He drew near, ands leaning his-folded-arms&#xD;
&#xD;
on the top of the easel, looked down into 'her&#xD;
face.&#xD;
" There is only one condition upon'whieh I&#xD;
could consent to go; that' is in' your hands.&#xD;
Will yon-accompany me ?"&#xD;
She understood it all in an instant, saw the&#xD;
new form in which  the trial presented itself;&#xD;
and her soul sickened.&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton, if I were your sister, or your&#xD;
child, I would gladly go; but, as your pupil, I&#xD;
can not."&#xD;
"As Electra Grey, certainly' not; but, as&#xD;
Electra Clifton, you could go."&#xD;
"Electra Grey will be carved on my tomb-&#xD;
stone."&#xD;
"Then yon decide my fate. I remain, and&#xD;
.wait the slow approach of death."&#xD;
" No, before just Heaven! I take no such&#xD;
responsibility, nor shall -you thrust it on' me.&#xD;
You are a man, and must decide your destiny&#xD;
for yourself; I'am a poor girl, having no claim&#xD;
upon, no power over you.  It is your duty to&#xD;
preserve the- life which God gave you, in the&#xD;
way prescribed by your.physician, and I have&#xD;
no voice in the matter.'It is your duty to go&#xD;
South, and it will be both weak and wicked to&#xD;
remain here under existing circumstances."&#xD;
"My lfe is centred in you; it is worthless,&#xD;
nay, a burden, separated from you.&#xD;
"Your life 'should be centred in something&#xD;
nobler, better ; in your duty, in your profes-&#xD;
sion, It is suicidal.to fold your hands listless-&#xD;
ly and look to me, as you do."&#xD;
"All these things have I tried, and I am&#xD;
weary of their hollowness, weary of life and&#xD;
the world. So long as I have your face here,&#xD;
I care not to cross my own threshold till friend-.&#xD;
ly hands bear me out to my quiet resting-&#xD;
lplace under the willows of Greeiwood. Elec-&#xD;
tra, my darling, think me weak if you will;but&#xD;
bear with me a little while longer, and then&#xD;
this, my shadow, shall flit from your, young&#xD;
heart, leaving not even a memory to.haunt&#xD;
you. Be patient ! I will soon pass away, to&#xD;
another, a more peaceful, blessed sphere."&#xD;
A melancholy suile lighted his fair waxen&#xD;
features, as waning, sickly sunshine 'in'an au&#xD;
tumn evening flickers over sculptured marble&#xD;
n a silent chuch-yard.'"&#xD;
How she compassionated his great weak-&#xD;
ness as he' wiped away the , moisture which,'&#xD;
even' on that cold, day, glistened on his 'fore-&#xD;
head.&#xD;
Oh ! I beseech you to go to Cuba. Go,&#xD;
and get strong once more."&#xD;
"Nothing will ever help me now. Sunny&#xD;
kies andt soft breezes bring.;tlo. healing foi&#xD;
ne. I want.to die here, in my home, wherm&#xD;
yopr hands will be about me.; not among'.&#xD;

He turned to the fire, and1 pringing upyuhe&#xD;

&#xD;
trailing clouds, looked down on her, and the&#xD;
keen, chilly wind- wafted a fine snow-powder&#xD;
in her face as-she pressed against it. The&#xD;
trees were bare, and the sere grass grew hoary&#xD;
-as the. first snow,-flakes of the season came&#xD;
down softly and shroud-like. The walks were&#xD;
deserted, save where a hurrying form crossed&#xD;
from street to 'street, homeward-bound ; and&#xD;
Electra, passed slowly along, absorbed in&#xD;
thoughts solder than the frosting that gath-&#xD;
ered on shawl and bonnet.. The thee and figure&#xD;
of the painter-glided spectrally before her at&#xD;
every step, and a mighty teinptation follow-&#xD;
ed at its hecls. Wjiy not strangle her heart ?&#xD;
Why not marry him and bear his name,.if,&#xD;
thereby,. she Could, make his 'few remaining&#xD;
months of existence happy, and, by accompa-&#xD;
nying :him South, prolong his life even for a&#xD;
few, weeks ?  She shuddered at the suggest-&#xD;
ion, it would be such a miserable lot. But&#xD;
then the question arose : " Who told you that&#xD;
your life was given for happiness? Do, you&#xD;
imagine your Maker set you on' earth solely&#xD;
tohunt your own enjoyment ?  Suppose duty&#xD;
costs ou pain and struggles ; it it ahy the less&#xD;
.duty   Nay, is it not all the more urgent&#xD;
duty ?"  She- knew that she could return to&#xD;
the artist, and, with, one brief' sentence, pour&#xD;
the chrism of joyover his suffering soul; and'&#xD;
her great compassion, mild-eyed, soft lipped,&#xD;
tender-hearted, whispered: Why not'? why&#xD;
not ?      .&#xD;
"Nature owns no man who is not a martyr.&#xD;
withal." It' this dictum possessed any value,&#xD;
did it'not point to her mission ? She could&#xD;
no longer shut hbr eyes and stumble on, for&#xD;
right in her path stood an awful form, with&#xD;
austere lip and fiiiry eye, demanding a parley,&#xD;
defying all escape; atnd, calmly, she stood face&#xD;
to face with her Sphinx, considering her rid-&#xD;
dle. A young, motherless girl, without the&#xD;
girding of a holy religion, a free, untamed soul,&#xD;
yielding allegiance to no creed, hearkening&#xD;
only to, the dictates of her tempestuous nature,&#xD;
now confronting the most ancient immemorial&#xD;
Destroyer who haunts the highways of society.&#xD;
Self-immolation, or a poisoning of the spring&#xD;
of joy in the heart of a fellow-creature'?  Was&#xD;
duty a Moloch, clasping its scorching arms&#xD;
around its devotees ?-a Juggernaut, indeed,&#xD;
whose iron wheels drank the life-blood of its&#xD;
victims? ," Will you see your benefactor sink&#xD;
swiftly into an early grave, and, standing by&#xD;
with tolded arms, persuade yourself that it is&#xD;
not your:duty to'"attempt to save him at all&#xD;
hazards ?  Can nothing, less than love ever&#xD;
sanction ,marriage ?" , Such wds the riddle&#xD;
hurled before her, and, as she pondered, the,&#xD;
floodgates of her sorrow and jealousy were&#xD;
once more lifted-the rush and roar ot bitter&#xD;
wite~rs drowned, fora time, the accents of con-&#xD;
science and of reason. .&#xD;
hut Qutsot these fierce asphaltic waves arose,&#xD;
Aphirodite-like, a pure, radiant, heavenlysform&#xD;
-'-a child' of all climes, conditions, and ages-&#xD;
&#xD;
an immortal ev gei; and, as the 'piercing,&#xD;
sunny eyes of w'manly intuition looked upon&#xD;
the riddle, ths stony lineaments of the Sphinx&#xD;
melted into air.. If womanly eyes rest on this&#xD;
page the answer need not' be traced here,&#xD;
for in every true woman's heart the. answer&#xD;
is to be found-engraved in God's own charac-&#xD;
ters; and, however the rubbish ofignoble mo-&#xD;
tives may accumulate, it cannever obliterate&#xD;
the divine handwriting. In the holiest oratory&#xD;
of her nature is enshrined an infallible talis-&#xD;
man, an ,gis, and she requires no other pano-&#xD;
ply in the long struggle incident to trials such&#xD;
as shook the stormy soul of the young artist.&#xD;
Faster fell the snow-flakes, cresting the waves&#xD;
of hair like toam, and, setting her teeth firmly,&#xD;
as if thereby locking the door against all, com-&#xD;
passionating compunctions, Electra left the&#xD;
park and turned into a cross-street, on which&#xD;
was situated an establishment where bouquets&#xD;
were kept for sale.  The , assortment was&#xD;
meagre at that late hour, but she selected a&#xD;
tiny bunch of delicate, fragrant, hothouse&#xD;
blossoms, and, shielding them with her shawl,&#xD;
hastened home. The studio was brilliant with&#xD;
gas-glare and warm with the breath of anthra-&#xD;
cite,' bat an aspect of dreariness, silence, and&#xD;
sorrow predohiinated. The figures in the&#xD;
pictures' shrank back in their frames, the stat-&#xD;
ues gleamed mournfully white and cold,,and&#xD;
the emaciated form and face of the painter,&#xD;
thrown into bold relief' by the dark green&#xD;
lining of the easy-chair, seemed to belong to&#xD;
realms of death rather than life. On the edge&#xD;
of the low scroll-sculptured mantle, supported&#xD;
at each corner by caryatides,  perched large&#xD;
time gray owl, with clipped wings folded,,&#xD;
and wide, solemn, oracular eyes fastened on&#xD;
the countenance of its beloved master. .A&#xD;
bronze clock, of exquisite workmanship, oc-&#xD;
cupied the centre, and represented the Angel&#xD;
of, Revelations "swearing by Rim that liveth,&#xD;
fhr ever and ever, that Time should be no longer."&#xD;
One hand held the open book, the other a&#xD;
hammer, which gave out the hours with clear.&#xD;
metallic ring; and along the base, just under-&#xD;
neath the silver-dial-plate, were carved, in&#xD;
German characters, the words of Richter:&#xD;
"And an immeasurably extended hammer was&#xD;
to strike the last hour of Time, and shiver the&#xD;
universe asunder."&#xD;
With swift, noiseless steps Electra came to&#xD;
the red grate, and, after a moment,. drew an&#xD;
ottoman close to the easy-chair. Perhaps.its&#xD;
occupant slept; perchance he wandered, with&#xD;
closed eyes, far down among the-,sombre, dank&#xD;
,crypts of memory. She laid her coolfingers&#xD;
on hid hand, and held the bouquet before him.&#xD;
- " My dear sir, here are your flowers; they&#xD;
are not as pretty as usual, but sweet enough&#xD;
to atone for lack of beauty."&#xD;
He fingered them caressingly, laid 'theak&#xD;
against his hollow cheeks, and hid his lips&#xD;
among their fragrant petals, but the starry&#xD;
eyes were fixed on the features of the pupii..&#xD;
&#xD;
" It is bitter weather out; did you brave it&#xD;
for these ? Thank you, but don't expose your-&#xD;
self so in future. Two invalids in a house are&#xD;
quite enough. You are snow-crowned, little&#xD;
one; do you know it ? The frosting- gleams&#xD;
right royally on that black hair of yours. Nay,&#xD;
child, don't brush it off; like all lovely things&#xD;
it fades rapidly, melts away like the dreams&#xD;
that flutter around a boy in the witchery of a&#xD;
long, still, sunny summer day.".,&#xD;
His thin hand nestled in her shining hair,&#xD;
and she submitted to the touch in silence.&#xD;
" My dove soared away from this dreary&#xD;
ark, -and bathed her silver wings in 'the free&#xD;
air of heaven ; returning but to bring me some&#xD;
grateful memorial, an olive-branch, where-&#xD;
with to deck this gloomy ark of mine. Next&#xD;
time she will soar farther, and find a. more&#xD;
tempting perch, and gladden Noah's eyes no&#xD;
more."&#xD;
"'if so, it will be because the high and dry&#xD;
land'of God beckons her; and when the del-&#xD;
uge is ended, she will be needed no longer."&#xD;
"For, then, Electra, Noah's haven of rest&#xD;
will be the fair still fields of Eternity."&#xD;
In. this semi-metaphoric strain he often in-&#xD;
dulged of late, but she felt'little inclination to&#xD;
humor the whim, and, interlacing her slight&#xD;
fingers, she6answered, half-impatiently:&#xD;
" Your simile is all awry, sir. Most unfort-&#xD;
unately, I have nothing dove-like in my na-&#xD;
ture."&#xD;
" Originally you had, but your character&#xD;
has been warped."&#xD;
" By what, or whom ?"&#xD;
" Primarily, by unhappy extraneous circum-&#xD;
stances, influences it you will, which contribut-&#xD;
ed to a diseased development of two passions,&#xD;
that now preponderate over all other elements&#xD;
of your character."&#xD;
" A diagnosis which I will not accept."&#xD;
" A true one, nevertheless, my child."&#xD;
" Possibly ; but we will waive a discussion&#xD;
just now. I am, and always intend to be, true&#xD;
to the nature which God gave me."&#xD;
"A dangerous dogma that.  Electra, how&#xD;
do you know that the 'nature' you fondle and&#xD;
plume yourself upon emanated from your&#xD;
Maker ?"&#xD;
" How do you know, sir, that God intended&#xD;
that willows should drop and trail their slen-&#xD;
der boughs earthward, while poplars, like&#xD;
granite shafts, shoot up, lifting their silver-&#xD;
shimmering leaflets ever to the clouds? Who&#xD;
fingered their germs and directed their&#xD;
course ?"~&#xD;
" The analogy will not hold between the&#xD;
vegetable kingdom and the moral and intel-&#xD;
lectual spheres. Men and women are not cast&#xD;
in particular moulds, bound byiron laws, and&#xD;
labelled, like plants or brutes, Genus ,&#xD;
Species . Moreover, to man 'alone was&#xD;
given free agency, even to the extent of&#xD;
uprooting, crushing entirely the original ima&#xD;
pulses implanted by God in the human heart&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
to act as motive power. I have known people&#xD;
insane enough to pluck out the wheat, and&#xD;
culture, into rank luxuriance, the tares in their&#xD;
nature. Child, do you ever look ahead to the&#xD;
coming' harvest-time ?"&#xD;
"if  do, it contents me to know that each&#xD;
soul binds up its own sheaves."&#xD;
"No;.angels are reapers, and make up the&#xD;
account for the Lord of the harvest."&#xD;
"1 don't, believe that. No third party has&#xD;
any voice in that last, long reckoning. God&#xD;
and the creature only see the balance-sheet."&#xD;
She rose, and, leaning against the mantle,&#xD;
.put out her .hand to caress the solemn-eyed&#xD;
solitary pet of the studio. How he came to he&#xD;
the solace and companion of the artist she had&#xD;
never been told, but knew that a strange fel-&#xD;
lowship linked the 'gray old favorite with the&#xD;
master, and wondered at the almost, human&#xD;
expression with which it sometimes looked&#xD;
from its lofty pedestal upon the langpid move-&#xD;
ments of the painter. " Munin " was the&#xD;
name he ever recognized and answered to,&#xD;
and, when she one iay repeated it to herself,&#xD;
puzzling over its significance, Vr. Clifton told&#xD;
her that it meant " memory," in Scandinavian&#xD;
lore, and belonged to one of the favorite birds&#xD;
of Odin. It was one of his many strange&#xD;
whims, fostered by life-lon researches among&#xD;
the mythologies of the Old orld; and Electra&#xD;
struggled to overcome the undefinable sensa-&#xD;
tion of awe and repulsion which'crept over&#xD;
her whenever she met that fascinating stare&#xD;
fixed upon her. As little love had the bird for&#xD;
her, and, though occasionally it settled' upon&#xD;
the cross-beam of her easel and watched the&#xD;
slow motion of her brush, they seemed" to&#xD;
shrink from each other. Now, as her soft hand&#xD;
touched his feathers, they rumpled, bristled,&#xD;
and he flitted to the artist's knee, uttering a&#xD;
hoarse, prolonged, most melancholy note, as&#xD;
the master caressed him.&#xD;
" Why are not you and Munin better&#xD;
friends ?"&#xD;
" Because I am not wise enough, r evil-bod-&#xD;
ing in appearance, or sufficiently owlish'to&#xD;
suit him, Isuppose. He Chills my blood some-&#xD;
times,'when I come here, in twilight,-before&#xD;
the gis is lighted. I would ,almost as soon&#xD;
confront Medusa."&#xD;
She took from the curious oval mosaic table&#xD;
f new book containing her mark, and reseated&#xD;
herself. As she did so, Munin flapped his&#xD;
'dusky wings and disappeared through the door&#xD;
opening into the hall, and, shading her'face&#xD;
with one hand, she read aloud a passage&#xD;
heavily underlined by a pencil.&#xD;
"'But this poor, miserable Me!' Is-this. then,&#xD;
all the-book 1 have got to read about God.in ?'&#xD;
Yes, truly so. No other book, nor fragment&#xD;
'of book, than that will you ever find-no vel-&#xD;
vet-bound missal, nor frankincensed manu-&#xD;
script; nothing hieroglyphic nor cuneitorm;&#xD;
papyrus and pyramid ate alike silent on this&#xD;

can be. In that is the image of God painted;&#xD;
in that is the law of God written;, in that is&#xD;

for through thyself only thou canst know God.&#xD;
Through the glass darkly; but, except through&#xD;
the glass, in no wise. A tremulous crystal,&#xD;
waved as water, poured out upon the ground;-&#xD;
you may defile it, despise it, pollute it at your&#xD;
pleasure, and at your peril; for on the peace&#xD;
of those weak waves must all the heaven you&#xD;
shall ever gain be first seen, and through such&#xD;
purity as you can win for those dark waves&#xD;
must.all the light of the risen Sun of Bright-&#xD;
ness be bent down by faint refraction. Cleanse&#xD;
them, and calm them, as you love your life."&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton, this epitomizes my creed.&#xD;
There is nothing new in it ; I grant you it is&#xD;
old as the Delphian inscription. Two thousand&#xD;
years ago Socrates preached it in the Agora&#xD;
at Athens. Now it shakes dff its Greek ap-&#xD;
parel, and comes to this generation encumbered&#xD;
in loosely-fitting English garments-immemo-&#xD;
rial Truth peering through modern masks."&#xD;
He regarded her with an expression of sor-&#xD;
rowful tenderness, and his hand trembled as he&#xD;
placed it upon her head._&#xD;
"6This darling creed, this infallible egotism&#xD;
of yours, will fail you iti the day of fierce trial.&#xD;
Pagan that you are, I know not what is to be-&#xD;
come of you. Oh, Electra ! if you would only&#xD;
be warned in time."&#xD;
The warmth of the room had vermilioned&#xD;
- her cheeks, and the long black lashes failed to&#xD;
veil in any degree the flash of the eyes she&#xD;
raised to his face. Removing the hand from&#xD;
her head, she took it in both hers, and a cold,-&#xD;
dauntless smile wreathed her lips.&#xD;
" Be easy on my account. . I am not afraid&#xD;
of my future.  Why should I be? God built&#xD;
an arsenal in every soul before he launched it&#xD;
on the stormy sea of'Time, and the key to&#xD;
mine is Will! I am young and healthy; the&#xD;
rich purple blood bubbles through my veins&#xD;
like Chian wine; and, with my heritage of&#xD;
poverty and obscurity, I look fortune's favor-&#xD;
ites in the eye, and dare them to retard or&#xD;
crush me. A vast caravan of mighty souls,&#xD;
'whose distant footsteps echo down the corri-&#xD;
dors of Time,' have gone before me; and step&#xD;
by step I tramp after. What woman has done,&#xD;
woman may do; a glorious sisterhood of artists&#xD;
beckon me on; what -Elizabeth Cheron, Si-&#xD;
bylla Merian, Angelica Kauffman, Elizabeth&#xD;
Le Brun, Felicie Fauveau, and Rosa Bonheur&#xD;
have achieved, I also will accomplish, or die in&#xD;
the effort.  These travelled no royal road to&#xD;
immortality, but rugged, thorny paths ; and&#xD;
who shall stay miy feet ? Afar off gleams my&#xD;
resting- place, but ambition scourges me un-&#xD;
ftagc/nl on. Do not worry about my future;&#xD;
I will tae care of it, and of myself.",-.&#xD;
" And when, after years of toil, you win&#xD;
fame, even fame enough to satisfy your large&#xD;
&#xD;
LL L.                               -&#xD;
expectations,. what then? Whither will you&#xD;
look for happiness?"&#xD;
" I will grapple fame to my empty heart,&#xD;
as women do other idols'"&#xD;
"It will freeze you, my dear child. Re-&#xD;
member the mournful verdict which Dante&#xD;
gave the world through the lips of Oderigi:&#xD;
Cimabue thought&#xD;
To lord it over Painting's'fleld; and now&#xD;
The cry is Giotto's, and his name eclipsed.&#xD;
Thus bath one cJuido from the other snatched&#xD;
The lettered prize: and he, perhaps, is born,&#xD;
Who shall drive either from their nest. The noise&#xD;
of worldly fame is but a blast of wind&#xD;
That blows from divers points and shifts its name,&#xD;
shifting the point it blows from."&#xD;
" And, Electra, that chill blast will wail&#xD;
through your lonely heart, chanting a requiem&#xD;
over the trampled, dead hopes that might have&#xD;
garlanded your life. Be warned, oh ! daugh-&#xD;
ter of Agamemnon-!&#xD;
'The earth hath bubbles'as the water hath;&#xD;
And this is .of them. "   .&#xD;
" At all events, I will risk it. Thank God!&#xD;
whatever other faults I confess to, there is no&#xD;
taint of cowardice in my soul.".&#xD;
She rose, and stood a moment on the rug,&#xD;
looking into the red net-work of coals, then&#xD;
turned to leave hire, saying :&#xD;
"I must go to your mother now, and pres-&#xD;
.ently I will bring your tea."&#xD;
4" You need not trouble. I can go to the&#xD;
dining-room to-night."&#xD;
" It is no trouble ; it gives me great pleasure&#xD;
to do something for your comfort ; and I know&#xD;
you always enjoy your supper more when you&#xD;
have it here."&#xD;
As she closed the door he pressed his face&#xD;
against the morocco .lining and groaned un-&#xD;
consciously, and large glittering tears, creep-&#xD;
ing from beneath, the trembling lashes, hid&#xD;
themselves in the curling brown beard.&#xD;
To see that Mrs. Clifton's supper suited her,'&#xD;
and then to read aloud to her for half an hour&#xD;
from the worn family bible, was part of the&#xD;
daily routine which Electra.permitted nothing&#xD;
to interrupt. - On this occasion she found she&#xD;
old lady seated, as usual, before the fire, her&#xD;
crutches leaning against the chair and her&#xD;
favorite cat curled on the carpet at* her feet.&#xD;
Most tenderly did the aged cripple love her&#xD;
son's protege, and the wrinkled sallow face&#xD;
lighted up with a smile of pleasure at her en-1&#xD;
trance.&#xD;
"I thought it was about time for' you to&#xD;
come to me. Sit down, dear, and touch the&#xD;
bell for Kate. How is Harry ?"&#xD;
" No strong , I am afraid. You know' this&#xD;
is very bad wea her for him." .&#xD;
S" Yes ; when he came up to-day I thought&#xD;
he looked ifiore feeble than I had ever seen&#xD;
him; and, as I sit here and listen to his hollow&#xD;
cough, every sound seems a stab at my heart."&#xD;
She rocked herself to and fro for a moment,&#xD;
and added, mournfully:&#xD;
&#xD;
-MAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Ah, child ! it is so hard to see my young-&#xD;
est boy going down to the grave before me.&#xD;
The last of five, I hoped he would survive me,&#xD;
but consumption is a terrible thing; it took my&#xD;
husband first, then, in quick succession, my&#xD;
other children, and now Harry, my darling,&#xD;
my youngest, is the last prey."&#xD;
Anxious to divert her mind, Electra adroitly&#xD;
changed the conversation, and when she rose&#xD;
to say good-night, some time after, had the sat,&#xD;
isfaction of knowing that the old lady thad&#xD;
fallen asleep. It was in vain that she arranged&#xD;
several tempting .dishes on - the table beside&#xD;
the painter, and coaxed him to partake of&#xD;
them; he received but a cup of tea from her&#xD;
hand, and motioned the remainder away. As&#xD;
the servant removed the tray he looked up at&#xD;
his pupil, and said :&#xD;
" Please wheel the lounge nearer to the&#xD;
grate ; I am too tired to sit up to-night."&#xD;
She complied at once, shook up the pillow,&#xD;
and, as he .laid his head upon it, she'spread his&#xD;
fieavy plaid shawl over him.&#xD;
"Now, sir, what shall I read this evening ?"&#xD;
" Arcana Caelestia," if you please."'&#xD;
She took up the volume, and began at the&#xD;
place he designated ; and, as she read on and&#xD;
on, her rich flexible voice rose and fell upon&#xD;
the air like waves of melody. One of her&#xD;
hands chanced to hang over the arm of the&#xD;
chair, and, as she sat near the lounge, thin hot&#xD;
fingers twined about it, drew it caressingly to&#xD;
the pillow, and held it tightly.. Her first im-&#xD;
pulse was to withdraw it, and an expression of&#xD;
annoyance crossed her features; but, on see-&#xD;
ond thought, she suffered her fingers to rest&#xD;
passively in his. Now and then, as she turned&#xD;
a leaf, she met his luminous eyes fastened upon&#xD;
her ; but after a time the quick breathing at-&#xD;
tracted her attention, and, looking down, she&#xD;
saw that he, too, was sleeping. She closed the&#xD;
book and remained quiet, fearful of disturbing&#xD;
him; arid as she studied the weary, fevered&#xD;
face, noting the marh of disease, the sorrow-&#xD;
ful drooping of' the -mouth, so indicative of&#xD;
grievous disappointment, a new and holy ten-&#xD;
derness awoke in her heart.  It was"a feeling&#xD;
analogous to that of a mother for a suffering&#xD;
child, who can be soothed only by her presence&#xD;
and caresses-an affection not unfrequently&#xD;
kindled in haughty natures by the entire de-&#xD;
pendence of a weaker one. Bleniled with this&#xD;
was a remorseful consciousness of the coldness&#xD;
with which she had persistently rejected, re-&#xD;
pulsed every manifestation of his devoted&#xD;
love ; and, winding her fingers through his&#xD;
long hair, she vowed an atonement for the&#xD;
past' irk increased gentleness for the remainder&#xD;
of his waning life. As she ,bent over hini, wear-&#xD;
ing her compassion in her face, he opened his&#xD;
eye's and looked at her.&#xD;
" How long have I slept ?"&#xD;
" Nearly an hour. How do you feel since&#xD;
your nap I"&#xD;
He made no reply, and she put her hand on&#xD;
&#xD;
ARIA.                                   67&#xD;
his forehead. The countenance lighted, and&#xD;
he said slowly:&#xD;
'" Ah I yes, press your cool soft little palm&#xD;
on my brow. It seems to still the throbbing&#xD;
in my temples."t                hb&#xD;
" It is late, Mr. Clifton, and I nMust leave&#xD;
you. William looked in, a few minutes since,&#xD;
to say that the fire burned in your room, butI&#xD;
would not wake you. - I will send him to you.&#xD;
Good-night."&#xD;
She leaned down voluntarily and kissed,&#xD;
him, and, with a quick movement, he folded&#xD;
her to his heart an instant, then released her,&#xD;
murmuring huskily:&#xD;
it God bless you, Electra, and reward you for&#xD;
your patient endurance. Good-night, my pre-&#xD;
cious child."&#xD;
She went to her own room, all unconscious&#xD;
of the burst of emotion which shook the feeble&#xD;
frame of the painter, long after she, had laid&#xD;
her head n her pillow in the sound slumber&#xD;
of healthful youth.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
The year that ensued proved a valuable&#xD;
school of patience, and taught thqyoung artist&#xD;
a gentleness of tone and quietude of'manner at&#xD;
variance with the natural impetuosity of her&#xD;
character. Irksome beyond degree was the&#xD;
discipline to which she subjected herself, but,&#xD;
with a fixedness of purpose that knew no wa-&#xD;
vering, she walked through the daily dreary&#xD;
routine, keeping her eyes upon the end that&#xD;
slowly but unmistakably approached. ' In mid-&#xD;
summer Mr. Clifton removed, for a few weeks,&#xD;
to the Catskill, and occasionally he rallied for&#xD;
a few hours, with a tenacity of strength almost&#xD;
miraculous. During the still sunny afternoons&#xD;
hosts of gay visitors, summer tourists, ofteh&#xD;
paused in their excursions to watch the ema-&#xD;
ciated form of the painter leaning on the arm&#xD;
of his beautiful pupil, or reclining on a lichen-&#xD;
carpeted knoll while she slktched the sur-&#xD;
rounding scenery. Increased feebleness pre-&#xD;
vented Mrs. Clifton from joining in these out-&#xD;
door jaunts, and early in September, when it&#xD;
became apparent that her mind was rapidly&#xD;
sinking into imbecility, they returned to the&#xD;
city. Memory seemed to have deserted its&#xD;
throne ; she knew neither her son nor Electra,&#xD;
and the last spark of intelligence.manifested&#xD;
itself in a semi-recognition of her favorite eat,&#xD;
which sprang to welcome her back as friendly&#xD;
hands bore her to the chamber she was to quit&#xD;
no more till death released the crushed, spi&#xD;
A letter, was' found on the atelier mantle,,dir&#xD;
rected to Electra in familiancharacters, whicha&#xD;
she had not seen fer months. Very qne'1&#xD;
she put it ih her pocket, and inthe soliti u~ of&#xD;

the book aside and.took up a volupiJana{mh&#xD;

She knew that Cornelius-Agrippa, . Theo-&#xD;
phrastus Paracelsus, and Swedenborg held&#xD;
singular mastery over hime; but she shrank&#xD;
from all these*now, as though they had been&#xD;
bound in flames, and a yearning to comfort&#xD;
him frofn the sacred lips of Jewish prophets'&#xD;
and apostles took possession of her. Passages&#xD;
which she had read to her, blind aunt came&#xD;
back to her now, ringing trumpet-toned in her&#xD;
ears, and she rose to bring a bible from Mrs.&#xD;
Clifton's room.&#xD;
" Where are you going ?"&#xD;
"To your mother's room, for a moment&#xD;
only. I want a book which I left there.".&#xD;
" Sit still. . Do not leave me, I beg of you."&#xD;
He drew her back to the seat, and after a&#xD;
short silence said, slowly:   '&#xD;
"Electra, are you afraid of death ?"&#xD;
"No, sir."&#xD;
" Do you know that I am dying ?"&#xD;
"I have. seen you as ill several times be-&#xD;
fore."&#xD;
" You are a brave, strong-hearted child ;&#xD;
glazed eyes and -stiffened limbs will not&#xD;
frighten you, I have but few hours to live;&#xD;
put your hand in m'n, and promise me that&#xD;
you will sit here till my soul quits .its ,clay-&#xD;
prison. Will you watch with me the death of&#xD;
the' year ? Are you afraid to stay with me&#xD;
and see me die ?"            .&#xD;
She would not trust herself to speak, but&#xD;
laid her hand in his and clasped it firmly. He&#xD;
smiled,.and added:&#xD;
"Will you promise to call no one?  I want&#xD;
no eyes but yours to watch me as I die. Let&#xD;
there tbe dnly you and me."&#xD;
"1I promise."&#xD;
For some moments he lay motionless, but&#xD;
the intensity of his gaze. made her restless,&#xD;
and she shaded her face.&#xD;
"Electra, my darling, your martyrdom&#xD;
draws to a close. I have been merciless in my&#xD;
exactions, I know ; you are worn to a shadow,&#xD;
and your face is sharp and' hagaard ; but. you&#xD;
will forgive me all, when the wdiows of Green-&#xD;

heavily-drawn breath of the suffeg., J@he&#xD;
memory of her aunt's tranquil death :hlpB&#xD;
the girl, and, finally, the desire to dirgAP&#xD;
thoughts to God, triumphed over every atb1&#xD;
feeling. She. sank on her; kneesbeside .&#xD;
lounge, and a passionate prayer leaped.fro&#xD;
her pale lips. ,She had not prayed for nearly&#xD;
four years, and the petition went, tsp to G$d&#xD;
framed in strange, incoherent language--&#xD;
plaintive cryito the Father to release, painless-&#xD;
ly, a struggling human soul. His firigers clung&#xD;
spasmodically to,hers, and, soon after,.the head&#xD;
sank on his che@, and she saw that he.slept.&#xD;
The glittering cortege of constellations mov-&#xD;
ed solemnly on in their eternal march through&#xD;
the fields of heaven, and in midskty hung a&#xD;
moon of almost supernatural brightness, glar-&#xD;

tWe motionless watcher, noting the indescriba-&#xD;
ble but unmistakable change creeping on, like&#xD;
the shadow which slowly-sailing summer clouds&#xD;
cast down upon green' meadows or flowery&#xD;
hill-sides, darkening the landscape. The fee-&#xD;
ble, thread-like pulse fluttered irregularly, but&#xD;
the breathing became easy and low as a babe's,&#xD;
and occasionally a gentle sigh heaved the&#xD;
chest. Once his lips had moved, and she&#xD;
caught the indistinct words-" Didereet, de-&#xD;
grees," -    , "influx      ," " type-cyeat-&#xD;
ure."  She knew that the end was at hand,&#xD;
and a strained, frightened expression came&#xD;
into- her large eyes as she glanced nervously'&#xD;
round the room, weird-and awful in its gloomy&#xD;
surroundings. 'The damp masses of hair clung&#xD;
to her temples, and she felt heavy drops gath-&#xD;
ering on her 'forehead, as in that glance she&#xD;
met the solemn, fascinating eyes of Munin&#xD;
staring at' her from the low- mantle. She&#xD;
caught her breath, and the deep silence was&#xD;
broken by the metallic tongue that dirged out&#xD;
" twelve."  The last stroke of the bronze&#xD;
hammer echoed 'drearily ; the old year lay&#xD;
stark and cold on its bier ; Munin flapped his&#xD;
dusk  wings with a. long, sepulchral, blood-&#xD;
curdling hoot, and the dying man opened his&#xD;
dim, failing eyes, and fixed themn for the last&#xD;
time on his pupil.,&#xD;
Electra, my darling."&#xD;
" My dear master, I am here."&#xD;
She lifted his head to her bosom, nestled her&#xD;
fingers into' his cold palm, and leaned her&#xD;
cheek against his brow. Pressing his face&#xD;
close to hers, the gray eyes closed, and a smile&#xD;
throned itself on the parted lips. A slight&#xD;
tremor shook the limbs, a soft shuddering&#xD;
breath swept across the watcher's face, and&#xD;
the " golden bowl " was shivered, the " silver&#xD;
cord" was loosed.&#xD;
She' sat there till the iciness of the rigid&#xD;
form chilled her, then laid the head tenderly&#xD;
down on its pillow, and walked to the mantle-&#xD;
piece. The Angel of Time lifted the hammer&#xD;
and struck "dne ;' and as she glanced acci-&#xD;
dentally at the inscription on the base, she&#xD;
remembered a favorite quotation -which it had&#xD;
often called from the cold lips of the dead&#xD;
painter:&#xD;
"Time is my fair seed-fioid, of Time I 'm heir."&#xD;
The seed-time had ended; the calm fields of&#xD;
Eternity stretched before him.no'w ; the fruits&#xD;
of the harvest were required at his hands.&#xD;
Were they full of ripe golden sheaves, or----?&#xD;
She shrank from her own questioning, and&#xD;
looked over her shoulder at the dreamless,&#xD;
smiling sleeper.&#xD;
"is palms are folded on his breast;&#xD;
There is no other thing expressed,&#xD;
But long disquiet merged in rest.", '&#xD;
The vigil was over, the burden was lifted&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
Four years had wrought material changes&#xD;
in the Town of W-.-; new streets had been&#xD;
opened, new buildings'erected, new forms trod&#xD;
the sidewalks new faces looked out of shop-&#xD;
windows and flashing equipages, and 'new&#xD;
shafts of granite and marble stood in the ceme-&#xD;
tery to tell of many who had been gathered to&#xD;
their forefathers, The old red school-house,&#xD;
where two generations had been tutored, was&#xD;
swept away to make place for a railroad de-&#xD;
pot; and, instead of the venerable trees that&#xD;
once overshadowed its precincts, bristling walls'&#xD;
of brick and mortar rang with the shrill whis-&#xD;
tle of the engine, or the sharp continual click&#xD;
of repairing-shops. The wild shout, the rip-&#xD;
pling laugh of careless, childish glee were&#xD;
banished, and the 'frolicsome flock of by-gone&#xD;
years had grown to manhood and womanhood,&#xD;
were sedate business-men and sober inatrons.&#xD;
If important revolutions had been effected in&#xD;
her early home, not less decided and apparent-&#xD;
was the change which had taken place in the&#xD;
heiress of Huntingdon Hill; and having been&#xD;
eyed, questioned, scrutinized.by the best fami-&#xD;
lies, and laid in the social scales, it was found&#xD;
a difficult matter to determine, her weight as&#xD;
accurately as seemed desirable. In common&#xD;
parlance, " her education was finished "-she&#xD;
was regularly and unmistakably " out." Eve-&#xD;
rybody hastened to inspect her, sound her,&#xD;
label her ; mothers to compare her with their&#xD;
own daughters; daughters to discover how&#xD;
much they had to apprehend in the charms of&#xD;
the new rival; sons to satisfy themselves with&#xD;
regard to the truth of the rumors concerning&#xD;
her beauty ; all with curiosity stamped on their&#xD;
countenances; all with dubiety written there&#xD;
at the conclusion. of their visit. Perfectly&#xD;
self-possessed, studiedly polite, attentive to'&#xD;
all the. punctilios of etiquette, polished and&#xD;
irreproachable in deportment, but cold, reti-&#xD;
cent, grave, indulging in no familiarities, and&#xD;
allowing none; fascinating by her extraordi-&#xD;
nary beauty and grace, but tacitly impressing&#xD;
upon all, " Thus far, and no farther." Havinga&#xD;
lost her aunt two years before her return, the&#xD;
duties of hostess devolved upon her, and she&#xD;
dispensed the hospitalities of her home with&#xD;
an easy though stately elegance, surprising-in&#xD;
one so inexperienced. No positive charge&#xD;
could be preferred against her by the inquisi-&#xD;
torial circle; even Mrs. Judge Harriss, the self-&#xD;
constituted, but universally acknowledged, au-&#xD;
tocrat of beau monde in W-, accorded her&#xD;
a species of negative excellence, and confessed&#xD;
herself baffled and unable to pronounce a&#xD;
verdict. An enigma to her own father, it was&#xD;
not wonderful'that strangers knit their brows&#xD;
in striving to analyze her character,'and ore&#xD;
long the cooing of carrier-pigeons became au-&#xD;
dible: "lHer mother had been very eccentric;&#xD;
evnbefor he death it wa   hispre that&#xD;
inany hung treateningly overherretrange&#xD;
&#xD;
things were told of her, and, doubtless, Irene&#xD;
inherited her peculiarities.". Nature furnishes&#xD;
some seeds with downy wings to insure distri-&#xD;
bution, and' envy and malice, and probably,&#xD;
very innocent and mild-intentioned gossip,&#xD;
soon provided this report-with remarkable fa-&#xD;
cilities for progress. It chanced that Dr. Ar&#xD;
nold was absent for some weeks after her ar-&#xD;
rival, and no sooner had he returned than be&#xD;
sought his quondam protige. Entering unan-&#xD;
nounced, he paused suddenly as he caught&#xD;
sight of her standing before the fire, with Par-&#xD;
agon at her feet. She lifted her, head and&#xD;
tame to meet him, holding out both hands,&#xD;
with a warm, bright smile.&#xD;
" Oh, Dr: Arnpld ! I am so glad to see you&#xD;
once more. It was neither friendly nor hos-&#xD;
pitable to go off just as I came home, after&#xD;
long years of absence. I am so very glad to&#xD;
see you."&#xD;
He held her hands and .gazed at her like&#xD;
one in a dream of mingled pain and pleasure,&#xD;
and when he spoke 1his voice was unsteady.&#xD;
" You can not possibly be as glad to see me&#xD;
as I am to have you back. - But I can't realize&#xD;
that this is, indeed, you, my pet-the Irene I&#xD;
parted with rather more than four 'years ago.&#xD;
Child, what is it ? What have you done to.&#xD;
yourself ? . I called you Queen in your infan-&#xD;
cy, when you clung to my finger and tottered&#xD;
across the floor to creep into my arms, but ten-&#xD;
fold more appropriate does the title seem now.&#xD;
You are not the same Irene who used to toil&#xD;
u my office-steps, and climb upon the tallest&#xD;
chair to examine the skeletons in my cases-&#xD;
the snakes andlizards in my jars. Oh, child !&#xD;
what a marvellous, what a glorious beauty you&#xD;
have grown to be."&#xD;
" Take care ; you will spoil her, Arnold.&#xD;
Don't you know, you old cynic, that women&#xD;
can't stand such flattery as yours ?" laughed&#xD;
Mr. Huntingdon.      "&#xD;
"I am glad you like me, Doctor ; I am glad&#xD;
that you think I have improved ; and, since&#xD;
you think so, I am obliged to you for express-&#xD;
ing, your opinion of me so kindly. I wish I&#xD;
could return your compliments, but my con-&#xD;
science vetoes any such proceeding. You look&#xD;
jaded-overworked. What is the reason that&#xD;
you have grown so gray and haggard ? We&#xD;
will enter into a compact to renew the old&#xD;
life; you shall treat me exactly as you used to&#xD;
do, and I shall come to you as formerly, and&#xD;
interrupt labors that seem too heavy. Sit&#xD;
down, and talk to me. I want to' hear your&#xD;
voice ; it is pleasant to my ears, makes music&#xD;
in my heart, calls up the by-gone. You have&#xD;
adopted a stick in my absence ; I don't like&#xD;
the innovation; it hurts me to think that you&#xD;
need it. I must take care of you, I see, and&#xD;
persuade you to relinquish it entirely."&#xD;
." Arnold, I verily believe she was more anx-&#xD;
ious to see you than everybody else in )VW -&#xD;
exept old Nele, her nurse."&#xD;
She did  lot contradict him, and the three&#xD;
&#xD;
sat conversing for more than an hour; then&#xD;
other visitors, came; and she withdrew to the&#xD;
parlor. The doctor had examined her closely&#xD;
all the while; had noted every word, action,&#xD;
expression; and a troubled, abstracted. look&#xD;
came into his face when she left. them.&#xD;
"Huntingdon, what is it ? What is it ?"&#xD;
" What is what ?  I don't understand you."&#xD;
" What has so changed that child ? I want&#xD;
to know what ails her ."&#xD;
"Nothing, that I know of. You know she&#xD;
was always rather singular."&#xD;
" Yes, but it was a different sort of singu-&#xD;
larity. She is too still and white and cold and&#xD;
stately. I told you it was a wretched piece of&#xD;
business to send a nature like hers, so differ-&#xD;
ent from everybody's' else, off among utter&#xD;
strangers ; to shut up that queer, 'free, tintam-&#xD;
ed young thing in a boarding-schoo[ for four&#xD;
years, with hundreds of miles between her and&#xD;
the few things she loved. She required very&#xD;
peculiar and skilful treatment, and, instead;&#xD;
you put her off.where she petrified ! I knew&#xD;
it would never answer, andI told you so. You&#xD;
wanted tp break her obstinacy, did you? She&#xD;
comes back marble. I tell you now I know&#xD;
her. better than you do, though you are her&#xD;
father, and. you may as well give up at onCe&#xD;
that chronic hallucination of 'ruling, conquer-&#xD;
ing her.' She is like steel-cold, firm, brittle;&#xD;
she will break, snap asunder ;-but bend.-&#xD;
never! never ! Huntingdon, I love that child ;&#xD;
I have a right to love her ; she has been very&#xD;
dear to me from her babyhood, and it would&#xD;
go hard wth me to know that any sorrow&#xD;
darkened her life. Don't allow your old plans&#xD;
and views to influence you now. Let Irene&#xD;
'be happy 'in her own way. Did you ever see&#xD;
a contented-looking eagle in a gilt cage ? Did&#xD;
you ever know a leopardess kept in a pad-&#xD;
-dock and taught to forget her native jungles'."&#xD;
Mr. Huntingdon moved uneasily, ponder-&#xD;
ing the unpalatable, advice.&#xD;
"You certainly don't mean to say that she&#xD;
has inherited  -."   He crushed bick the&#xD;
words; could he crush the apprehension, to6?&#xD;
"I mean to say that, if she were my cild, I&#xD;
would be guided by her, instead of striving to&#xD;
cut her. character to fit the totally different&#xD;
pattern of my own."&#xD;
He put on his hat, thrust his hands into his&#xD;
pockets, stood for some seconds frown ing so&#xD;
heavily that the shaggy eyebrows met and&#xD;
partially concealed the. cavernous eyes, then&#xD;
nodded to the master of the house and sought&#xD;
his buggy. From that .day Irene was con-&#xD;
scious of a keener and more constant scrutiny&#xD;
on her father's part-a ceadeless surveida 'ce,&#xD;
silent, but rigid-that soon grew intolerable.&#xD;
No matter how she employed her time, or&#xD;
whither she went, he seetned thoroughly cog-&#xD;
nizant of the details of her life; and w 1r&#xD;
she lenfst expected interruption or dictation his,&#xD;
hand, firm though gentle, pointed the way,&#xD;
and his voice ca'Imly but inflexibly directed.&#xD;

Ier affection had been in no degree alienated&#xD;
by their long separation, and, through its&#xD;
sway, she submitted for a time ; but Hunting-&#xD;
don blood ill brooked restraint, and,' ere long,&#xD;
hers became feverish, necessitating release.&#xD;
As in all tyrannical natures, his exactions&#xD;
grew upon her compliance. She was allowed&#xD;
no margin for the exercise of judgment or in-&#xD;
clination; her associates were'selected,. thrust&#xD;
upon her"; her occupations decided without&#xD;
reference to her wishes. From the heartless,&#xD;
frivolous routine marked out she shrank in dis-&#xD;
gust; and, painful as was the alternative, she&#xD;
prepared for the clash which soon became in-&#xD;
evitable. He wished her to behappy, but in&#xD;
his own way, in accordance with his views and&#xD;
aims, and, knowing the, utter antagonism of&#xD;
taste and feeling which unfortunately existed,&#xD;
she determined to resist. Governed less by&#xD;
impulse than sober second thought and sound&#xD;
reasoning, it was not until after long and pa-&#xD;
tient deliberation that she finally resolved&#xD;
upon her future course, and steadily main-&#xD;
tained it. She felt most keenly that it was a&#xD;
painful, a lamentable resolution, but'none the&#xD;
less a necessity; and, having once determined,&#xD;
she went forward with a fixedness of purpose&#xD;
characteristic of her family. It was the begin-&#xD;
ning of a life-long contest, and, to one who&#xD;
understood Leonard Huntingdon's disposition,&#xD;
offered a dreary prospect.o&#xD;
From verbal differences she habitually ab-&#xD;
stained; opinions which she knew to be disa-&#xD;
greeable to him she carefully avoided giving&#xD;
expression to in his presence ; and, while al-&#xD;
ways studiously thoughtful of his comfort, she&#xD;
preserved a respectful deportment, allowing&#xD;
herself no hasty or defiant words. Fond of&#xD;
pomp and ceremony, and imbued with certain&#xD;
aristocratic notions, which an ample fortune&#xD;
had, always permitted -him' to 'indulge, Mr.&#xD;
Huntingdon entertained company in princely&#xD;
style and .whenever an opportunity offered.&#xD;
His dinners, suppers, and card-parties were&#xD;
known far and wide, and Huntingdon Hill be-&#xD;
came proverbial I'or hospitality thi-oughout the&#xD;
state. Strangers were feted, and it was a rare&#xD;
occurrence for father and daughter to dine&#xD;
quietly together. Fortunately for Irene, the&#xD;
servants were admirably trained; and though&#xD;
this round of' company imposed a weight of re-&#xD;
sponsibilities oppressiye to one so inexperi-&#xD;
enced, she apple ed herself diligently to domes-&#xD;
tic economy, and soon became familiarized&#xD;
with its details. Her father had been very&#xD;
anxious to provide her with a skilful house-&#xD;
keeper, to relieve her of the"care and tedious&#xD;
minutia of such matters ; but she refused to&#xD;
accept one, avowing her belief that it was the&#xD;
imperative duty of every woman to superintend&#xD;
and inspect the management of her domestic&#xD;
affairs. Consequently, from the first' week of&#xD;
her return, she made it a rule to spend an hour&#xD;
after breakfast in her dining-room pantry, de.&#xD;
termining and arranging the details of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
The situation of' the house comianded an&#xD;
extensive and beautiful prospect, and the an-&#xD;
cient trees that overshadowed it, imparted a&#xD;
venerable and imposing aspect. The building&#xD;
was of brick, overcast, to represent granite,&#xD;
and along three sides ran a wide gallery, sup-&#xD;
ported by lofty circular pillars, crowned with&#xD;
unusually heavy capitals.  The main body&#xD;
consisted of two stories, with a hall in the&#xD;
centre and three rooms on either side ; while&#xD;
two long single-storied wings stretched out&#xD;
right and left-one a billiard-room, the other-&#xD;
a greenhouse.&#xD;
The parlors and library occupied.one side-&#xD;
the first opening into the greenhouse; the&#xD;
dining-room and smoking-room were corres-&#xD;
ondingly situated to the billiard-saloon. The&#xD;
frescoed ceilings were too low to suit modern&#xD;
ideas; the windows were large, and nearly&#xD;
square ; the faciirgs, sills, and doors all of ce-&#xD;
dar, dark as mahogany with age, and polished&#xD;
as rosewood. The tall mantle-pieces were of&#xD;
fluted Egyptian black marble, and along the&#xD;
freshly-tinted walls the elaborate arabesque&#xD;
moulding or cornice hung heavy and threat-&#xD;
ening. A broad easy flight of white marble"&#xD;
steps led up to the richly-carved front-door,&#xD;
with its massive silver knocker bearing' the&#xD;
name of Huntingdon in old-fashioned Italian.&#xD;
characters ; and in the arched niches, on&#xD;
either side of this door, stood two statues,&#xD;
brought from Eurpe by Mr. Huntingdon's&#xD;
father, and supposed to represent certain Ro-&#xD;
man penates.&#xD;
From the hall on the second floor, a narrow,&#xD;
spiral, iron stairway ascended to a circular&#xD;
observatory on the roof, with a row of small&#xD;
columns corresponding with those below, and&#xD;
a tessellated floor of alternating white and&#xD;
variegated squares-of marble. Originally the&#xD;
observatory had been crowned by a heavy&#xD;
pagoda-shaped roof, *but recently this had.&#xD;
been removed and a covering of glass substi-&#xD;
tuted, whihh, like that of hothouses, could be&#xD;
raised and lowered at pleasure by means  .&#xD;
ropes and pulleys. Two generations had bm-&#xD;
bellished this house, and the modern wings&#xD;
forming .the cross had been erected within&#xD;
Irene's recollection.  In expectation. of her&#xD;
return, an entirely new set of furniture had&#xD;
been selected in New York,. and arranged&#xD;
some weeks before her arrival-costly carpets,&#xD;
splendid mirrors, plush and brocatel sofas, rich&#xD;
china, and 'every luxury which wealth and&#xD;
fastidious taste could supply. *The grounds in&#xD;
front, embracing several acres,-were enclosed&#xD;
by, a brick wall, and at the foot of the hill, at&#xD;
the entrance of the long avenue of elms, stood&#xD;
a tall arched iron gate. A smoothly-paven&#xD;
terrace of' hermuda grass ran round the house,&#xD;
and the broad carriage-way swept up to a&#xD;
mound opposite the door, surmounted by the&#xD;
bronze figure of a crouchin" dog. -On one&#xD;
side of the avenue a beautif~al lawn, stadded&#xD;
with clumps of trees, extended to the wall; on&#xD;
&#xD;
the other serpentine walks, bordered with low&#xD;
hedges, carved flower-beds of diverse shapes;&#xD;
and here delicate trellis-work supported rare,&#xD;
creepers, and airy, elegant arbors and summer-&#xD;
houses were overgrown with vines of rank&#xD;
luxuriande. Everything about the parlerre,&#xD;
from the well-swept gravel walks to-the care-&#xD;
fully-clipped hedges, betokened constant at-&#xD;
tention and lavish expenditure.  But the&#xD;
crowning glory of the place was its wealth&#xD;
of trees-the ancient avenue of mighty elms,&#xD;
arching grandly to the sky like .the groined&#xD;
nave of some vast cathedral; The circlet of&#xD;
sentinel poplars towering around the house,&#xD;
and old as its foundations; the long, undulat-&#xD;
ing line of venerable willows waving at the&#xD;
froot of the lawn over the sinuous little brook&#xD;
that rippled on its way to the creek ; and, be-&#xD;
yond the mansion, cloting the sides, of a&#xD;
steeper hill, a sombre background of murmur-&#xD;
ing, solemn, immemorial pines.  Such was&#xD;
Irene's home-stately and elegant-kept 'so&#xD;
thoroughly repaired that, in its cheerfulness,&#xD;
its age was forgotten.&#xD;
The society of W       was considered re-&#xD;
markably fine. There was quite an aggrega-&#xD;
tion of wealth and refinement ; gentlemen,&#xD;
whose, plantations were situated-in adjacent&#xD;
counties, resided here, with -their families ;&#xD;
some, who spent their winters on the seaboard?&#xD;
resorted here for the summer; its bar was said&#xD;
to possess more talent than any other in the&#xD;
state; its schools claimed to be unsurpassed ;'&#xD;
its boasted of a concert-hall, a lyceum, a hand-&#xD;
some court-house, a commodious, well-built&#xD;
jail, and half-a-dozen as fine churches as any.&#xD;
country-town could desire. I would fain avoid&#xD;
the term, if possible, but no synonym exists-&#xD;
W        was, indisputably, an " aristocratic'&#xD;
place.&#xD;
Thus; after more than four years absence,&#xD;
the summers of which had been spent in travel&#xD;
among the beautiful mountain scenery of the&#xD;
North, the young heiress returned to the home&#xD;
of her childhood. Standing on the verge of&#xD;
nineteen, she put the early garlanded years&#xD;
behind her and looked into the solemn temple&#xD;
of womanhood, with its chequered pavement&#xD;
of light and shadow ; its storied friezes, gilded&#xD;
architraves, and fretted shrines, wherewhite-&#xD;
robed hands of devotees enter with uncertain&#xD;
step, all eager, trembling' Mystw, soon to be-&#xD;
come clear-eyed, sad-eyed, Epnptc, through&#xD;
the unerring, mystical, sacred initiation of the&#xD;
only true hierophant-Time.&#xD;
From her few early school associates she&#xD;
had become completely estranged; and the&#xD;
renewal of their acquaintance now soon.con-&#xD;
vinced herthat the utter want of congeniality in&#xD;
character and habits of life precluded the possi-&#xD;
bility of,.any warm friendships between them.&#xD;
For several months after her return shea pa-&#xD;
tiently,. hopefully, faithfully studied the disgo-&#xD;
sitions of the members of various families with&#xD;
whom she foresaw that she would be thrown,&#xD;
&#xD;
by her father's wishes,linto intimate relation-&#xD;
ship, and satisfied herself that, among all&#xD;
these, there was not one, save Dr. Arnold,&#xD;
whose'counsel, assistance, or sympathy she felt&#xD;
any inclination to claim. Human nature at&#xD;
least is, beyond all cavil,-cosmopolitan in its&#xD;
characteristics (barring a few ethnologic limi-&#xD;
tations); and a given number of men and&#xD;
women similarly circumstanced iii Chili, Eag-&#xD;
land, Madagascar, Utah, or Biirmah would,&#xD;
doubtless;-yield a like quota' of moral and in-&#xD;
tellectual idiosyncrasies.  In fine, W..-----&#xD;
was not in any respect peculiar, or, as a com-&#xD;
munity, specially afflicted with heartlessness,&#xD;
frivolity, brainlessiess, or mammonism:; the&#xD;
average was fair. reputable in all respects.&#xD;
But, incontrovertibly, the girl 'who came to&#xD;
spend her life among these people was totally&#xD;
dissimilar in criteria of action, thought, and&#xD;
feeling. To the stereotyped conventional stand-&#xD;
ard of fashionable lire she had never yielded&#xD;
allegiance; and now stood (not in the St. Si-&#xD;
mon, Fourier, Owen, or Leroux sense).a social&#xD;
free-thinker. For a season she allowed her-&#xD;
self to be whirled on by the current of dinners,&#xD;
parties, and picnics ; but soon her sedate, con-&#xD;
templative temperament revolted from the&#xD;
irksome round, and gradually she outlined and&#xD;
pursueda different course, giving to her gay&#xD;
companionsjust what courtesy required, no'&#xD;
more.&#xD;
Hugh had prolonged his stay in Europe&#xD;
beyond the period oiginaljy designated; and&#xD;
instead of arriving -in time to accompany his&#xD;
uncle and cousin home, he did not sail for some&#xD;
months after their return. At length, how-&#xD;
ever, letters were received, announcing his&#xD;
presence in New York and fixing the day&#xD;
when his relatives might expect him.&#xD;
-           CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
The carriage had been despatched to the&#xD;
depot, a servant stood at the end of the&#xD;
avenue waiting to throw open the gate,Mr.&#xD;
Huntingdon walked up and down the wide&#xD;
colonnade, and Irene sat before the fire int her&#xD;
own room, holding in one palm the flashing&#xD;
betrothal-ring, which she had been forced to&#xD;
wear since her return from New York. She&#xD;
had loa ed into the rooms to see that all was&#xD;
bright and cheerful,,had looped back the cur-&#xD;
tains in the apartment prepared for Hugh, had&#xD;
filled the vases with flowers that he preferred&#xD;
in his boyhood, and now listened for his ap-&#xD;
proach with complex emotions. The sole 'cfu-&#xD;
panion of herinfancy, she would have hailed&#xD;
his arrival with unmixed joy but for the pe-&#xD;
culiar relationship in which she iow stood to&#xD;
him. The few years of partial peace had&#xD;
passed; she knew- that the. hour drew tiear&#xD;

&#xD;
jewelry-box, she turned the key,. and just&#xD;
then her father's voice rang through the'&#xD;
house.&#xD;
"'Irene ! the carriage is coming up the&#xD;
avenue."&#xD;
She went slowly down stairs, followed by&#xD;
Paragon, and joined her father at the door.&#xD;
His searching look discovered nothing in the&#xD;
serene face; the carriage stopped, and he hast-.&#xD;
ened to meet his nephew.&#xD;
" Come' at last, eh! Welcome home, my&#xD;
dear boy."&#xD;
The young man turned from his uncle,&#xD;
sprang up the steps, then paused, and the&#xD;
cousins looked at each other.,&#xD;
"Well, Hugh ! I am very glad to see you&#xD;
once more."&#xD;
She held out her hands, and he saw at a'&#xD;
glance that her .fingers were unfettered.&#xD;
Seizing them warmly, he bent forward, bit&#xD;
she drew back coldly, and he exclaimed:&#xD;
"'Irene 1 I claim a warmer welcome."&#xD;
She made a haughty, repellent gesture, and&#xD;
moved forward a few steps to greet the stran-&#xD;
ger who accompanied him.&#xD;
" My daughter, this is your uncle, Eric&#xD;
Mitchell, who has not seen you since you were&#xD;
a baby."&#xD;
The party entered the house, and, seated&#xD;
beside him, Irene gazed with mingled emo-&#xD;
tions of pain and pleasure upon her mother's&#xD;
only brother. He was about thirty, but look-&#xD;
ed older, from life-long suffering; had used&#xD;
crutches from the time he was five years of&#xD;
age, having been hopelessly crippled by a fall.&#xD;
during his infancy. His features were sharp,&#xD;
his cheeks wore the sallow hue of habitual ill-&#xD;
health,.and his- fine gray eyes were somewhat&#xD;
sunken. Resting his crutches, against the&#xD;
-sofa, he leaned back and .looked long and&#xD;
earnestly at his niece. Very dimly he remem-&#xD;
bered a fair flaxen-haired baby whom the&#xD;
nurse had held out to be kissed when he was&#xD;
sent to Philadelphia to be treated for his lame-&#xD;
ness ; soon after he heard of his sister's death,&#xD;
and then his tutor took him to Europe, to&#xD;
command the- best medical advice of the Old&#xD;
World.&#xD;
" From the faint recollection which I have&#xD;
of your mother, I think you strongly resemble&#xD;
her,". he said, at last, in a fond, gentle tone.&#xD;
"1I don't know about that, Eric. She is far&#xD;
more of a Huntingdon than a Mitchell. She&#xD;
has many of the traits of your family, but in&#xD;
appearance she certainly belongs to my side&#xD;
of the house. She very often reminds me of&#xD;
Hugh's mother."&#xD;
Conversation turned upon the misfortune of&#xD;
the cripple; he spoke freely of the unsuccess-&#xD;
ful experiments made by eminent physicians;&#xD;
of the hopelessness of his case; and Irene was&#xD;
particularly -impressed by the calmness ,and&#xD;
patience' with which he seemed to have' e-&#xD;
signed himself to this great affliction. She&#xD;
could detect no ta~ce of complaining bitter.-&#xD;
&#xD;
ness, or, what was still more to be deplored,&#xD;
the irritable, nervous querulousness so often&#xD;
observed in persons of his situation.  She&#xD;
found him a ripe scholar, a profound archeolo-&#xD;
gist, and philosophic observer of his age and&#xD;
generation ; and, deeply interested in his quiet,&#xD;
low-toned talk, she.felt. irresistibly drawn to-&#xD;
ward him, careless of passing hours and of&#xD;
Hugh's illconcealed impatience of manner.&#xD;
As they rose from the tea-table her cousin said,&#xD;
laughingly:&#xD;
"I protest against monopoly. I have not&#xD;
been able to'say three words to my lady-cous-&#xD;
in."&#xD;
" I yield the floor, from necessity. My long&#xD;
journeyhas unfitted me for this evening, and&#xD;
I must bid you all an early good-night."&#xD;
" Can I do anything for you, Uncle ?"&#xD;
"No, thank you, Irene; I have a servant&#xD;
who thoroughly understands taking care of'&#xD;
me. Go talk to Hugh, who has been wishing&#xD;
me among the 'antipodes."&#xD;
He shook hands with her, smiled kindly, and&#xD;
Mr. Huntingdon assisted him to'his room.&#xD;
" Irene, come into the library, and let me&#xD;
have a cigar."&#xD;
" How tenacious your badhabits are, Hugh."&#xD;
" Smoking belongs to no such category.&#xD;
My habits are certainly quite as tenacious as&#xD;
ny cousin's antipathies."&#xD;
He selected a cigar, lighted it, and drawing&#xD;
a chair near hers, threw himself into it with&#xD;
an expression, of great satisfaction. " It is de-&#xD;
lightful to get back home and see you again,&#xD;
Irene. I felt some regret at quitting Paris,&#xD;
but the sight of your face more than compen-&#xD;
sates me."&#xD;
She was looking very earnestly at him, not-&#xD;
ing the'-alteration in his appearance, and for a&#xD;
moment his eyes drooped before hers. She&#xD;
saw that the years had been spent,. not in&#xD;
study, but in a giddy round of pleasure and&#xD;
dissipation, yet the bright, frank, genial ex-&#xD;
pression of boyhood still lingered, and she&#xD;
could not deny that he had grown up a very&#xD;
handsome man. She knew that he was capa-&#xD;
ble of sudden, spasmodic impulses of generosity,&#xD;
but saw that selfishness remained the great&#xD;
substratum of his character," -I her keen feel-&#xD;
ing of disappointment showeed her now how&#xD;
much she had hoped to find him changed in&#xD;
this respect.&#xD;
" Irene, I had a right to expect a warmer&#xD;
welcome than you deigned to give me."&#xD;
" Hugh, remember that we have ceased to&#xD;
be children. When you learn to regard me&#xD;
simply as your cousin, and are satisfied with a&#xD;
cousin's welcome, then, and not until then,&#xD;
shall you receive it. Let childish whims pass&#xD;
with the years that have separated us; rake&#xD;
up no germs of contention to mar this first&#xD;
evenin'r of your return. Bc reasonable, and&#xD;
now tefl me how you have employed yourself&#xD;
since we parted ; what have you seen? what&#xD;
have you gleaned ?"'&#xD;
&#xD;
He flushed, angrily, but the imperturbable,&#xD;
face controlled him, even against his will, and,&#xD;
muttering something which she thought sound-&#xD;
ed very much like an oath, he smoked for some*&#xD;
seconds in silence. Without noticing his'sul-&#xD;
lenness, she made some .inquiries concerning.&#xD;
his sojourn in Paris, and insensibly he found&#xD;
himself drawn into a narration of his course&#xD;
of life. She listened with apparent interest,&#xD;
making occasional good-humored comments,&#xD;
and bringing him back to the subject when-&#xD;
ever he attempted a detour toward the topic&#xD;
so extremely distasteful to her.&#xD;
The clock struck eleven ; she rose, and said :&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, Hugh, for keeping you&#xD;
up so late. I ought to have known that you&#xD;
were fatigued by railroad-travel, and required&#xD;
sleep. You know the way to your room;'it is&#xD;
the same you occupied before you went to&#xD;
college. Good-night; I hope you will rest&#xD;
well."&#xD;
She held out her hand carelessly*; he took&#xD;
it eagerly, and holding it up to the light said,&#xD;
.in a disappointed tone:&#xD;
"Irene, where is my ring?  Why are you&#xD;
not wearing it ?'&#xD;
"'It is in my jewelry-box. As I gave you&#xD;
my reasons for not wearing it, when you offer-&#xD;
ed it to 'me, it is not necessary to repeat them&#xD;
now. Good-night, Hugh.; go dream of some-&#xD;
thing more agreeable than our old childish&#xD;
quarrels."  She withdrew her fingers and left&#xD;
him.&#xD;
As she entered her own room and closed the&#xD;
door, she was surprised to find her nurse sit-&#xD;
ting before the fire, with her chin in her hands,&#xD;
and her keen black eyes fixed on the coals.&#xD;
"Aunt Nellie, what are you sitting up so&#xD;
late for?  You will have another spell of&#xD;
rheumatism, tramping about this time of&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"I have been in to' see Mass' Eric, blessed&#xD;
lamb that he always was-and always will be.&#xD;
He is so changed I never would have known&#xD;
him; he was a weak little white-faced cripple&#xD;
when I- first saw him twenty years ago. It&#xD;
seems like there is a curse on your family any-&#xD;
how, both sides. They died off, and'have been&#xD;
killed off, on your mother's side, till Mass' Eric&#xD;
is the only one left of all the Mitchells, and, as&#xD;
for Master's family, you and Hugh are the two&#xD;
last. You know some families run out, and I&#xD;
don't think Master ought to try to overturn the&#xD;
Lord's plans. Queen, let things take their&#xD;
course."&#xD;
"Who has put all this into your head ?"&#xD;
" Nobody put it into my head ! I should&#xD;
like to know where myeyes have been these&#xD;
many years ? I have n't been so near blind all&#xD;
my life. Don't you suppose I know what Mas-&#xD;
ter 's been after since you were eighteen&#xD;
months old ? Wasn't I standing by the bed&#xD;
when Hugh's mother died, and didn't I hear&#xD;
Master promise her that, when you were grown,&#xD;
you and Hugh should marry ? .Don't I know&#xD;
&#xD;
how your poor dying ipother cried, and wrung&#xD;
her hands, and said ' Harm would come of it&#xD;
all, and she hoped you would die while you&#xD;
were a baby?' She had, found out what&#xD;
Huntingdon temper was. Poor blessed saint !&#xD;
what a life she did leadsbetween Miss Margaiet&#xD;
and Miss Igabella! It is no use'to shut your&#xD;
eyes to -it, Queen. You might just as well&#xD;
look at it at once. It is a sin for near kin like&#xD;
you and Hugh to marry, and you ought to set&#xD;
your face.against it. He is just his 'mother&#xD;
over again, and you will see trouble, as sure as&#xD;
your name is Irene, if you don't take a stand.&#xD;
Oh ! they are managing people! and the Lord&#xD;
have mercy on folks they don't like, for it is n't&#xD;
in Huntingdon blood to forgive or to forget&#xD;
anything. I am so thankful your Uncle Eric&#xD;
has come--he will help to stand between you&#xD;
and trouble. Ah! it is coming, Queen! it 's&#xD;
coming ! You did n't see how your father&#xD;

I was'looking through the window, and saw it&#xD;
all. I have n't'had one hour's peace s~ e I&#xD;
dreamed of seeing you and your.mothe to-&#xD;
gether. Oh, my baby ! my baby ! thee is&#xD;
trouble and sorrow thickening for you; I kiow&#xD;
it. I have had a warning of it."&#xD;
She inclined her' head on one side, and&#xD;
rocked herself to and fro, much as did ewly&#xD;
Pelasgic Dodonides in, announcing oracular&#xD;
decrees.&#xD;
" You need not grieve about it; 'I want no-.&#xD;
body to stand between me and trouble. Be-&#xD;
side, Nellie, you. must remember that, in all&#xD;
my father does, he intends and desires to pro-&#xD;
mote my welfare and to make me happy."'&#xD;
"Did lie send you off to that boarding-scool&#xD;
for your happiness ?  You were very happy&#xD;
there, wern't you? It is no use to try to&#xD;
blindfold me ; I have lived a little too long.&#xD;
Oh, my baby ! your white, white face, and big&#xD;
sorrowful blue eyes fellow me day and night ;&#xD;
I knew how it would be when you were barn.&#xD;
You came into this world among awful signs !&#xD;
the sun was eclipsed ! chickens went to roost,&#xD;
as if. night had 'come; and I saw stars in the&#xD;
sky at two o'clock in the day ! Oh! I thought,&#xD;
sure enough, judgment-day .had come at last ;&#xD;
and when they put you in my arms I trembled&#xD;
so I could hardly stand. Maj God have mer-&#xD;
cy on you, Queen !"&#xD;
She. shuddered for a moment, as if in the&#xD;
presence of some . dread evil, and, rising,&#xD;
wrapped her shawl about her shoulders and&#xD;
left the room.&#xD;
Irene looked after her retreating form, smil-&#xD;
ing at the superstitious turn her thoughts had&#xD;
taken, then, dismissing the 'subject, she fell&#xD;
asleep, thinking of her uncle.&#xD;
A week passed, varied by few, incidents of&#xD;
interest; the newcomers became thoroughly.&#xD;
domesticated-the old routine was re-estab-&#xD;
lished. Hugh seemed gay and careless-hiunt-&#xD;

prompted. He had had a long conversation&#xD;
with his uncle, and the result was that; for the&#xD;
present, no allusion was made to the future.&#xD;
In Irene's presence the subject was tempora-&#xD;
rily tabooed. She knew that the project was&#xD;
not relinquished-was only veiled.til  a conve-&#xD;
nient season, and, giving to the momentary&#xD;
lull its full value, she acquiesced, finding in&#xD;
Eric's society .enjoyment and resources alto-&#xD;
gether unexpected, Instinctively they seemed,&#xD;
to comprehend each other's character, and&#xD;
while both were taciturn and undemonstra-&#xD;
tive, a warm affection sprang up between&#xD;
them.&#xD;
On Sunday. morning, as the family group&#xD;
sat~ around' the breakfast-table 'waiting for&#xD;
Hugh, who lingered, as usual, over his second&#xD;
cup of chocolate, Mr. Mitchell suddenly laid&#xD;
down the fork with which he had been describ-&#xD;
ing a series of geometrical figures on the fine&#xD;
-damask, and said : "I met ayoung man in&#xD;
Brussels, who interested me extremely, and&#xD;
in connection with whom I venture the pre-&#xD;
diction that, if he lives, he will occupy a con-&#xD;
spicuous position in the affairs of his country.&#xD;
He is, or was, Secretary of Mr.'Campbell, our&#xD;
Minister to ---, and they were both on a&#xD;
visit to Brussels when I 'met them. His name&#xD;
is Aubrey, and he told me that he lived here.&#xD;
His talents are of the first order ; his ambition&#xD;
unbounded, I should- judge ; .and his patient,&#xD;
laborious application certainly surpasses any-&#xD;
thing I have ever seen. It happened that a&#xD;
friend of mine, from London, was prosecuting&#xD;
certain researches among the MS. archives at&#xD;
Bruesels, and here, immersed in study, lie says&#xD;
he found the .secretary, who completely dis-&#xD;
tanced him in his investigations, and then, with&#xD;
unexpected generosity, placed his notes at my&#xD;
friend's disposal. His industry is almost in-&#xD;
credible. Conversing with Campbell concern-&#xD;
ing him, I learned that he was a protege of the&#xD;
minister, who spoke of his future in singularly&#xD;
sanguine terms. He left him some time since&#xD;
to embark in the practice of law. . Do you&#xD;
know him, Huntingdon ?"&#xD;
"No, sir; but I know that his' father was&#xD;
sentenced to the gallows, and Only; saved him-&#xD;
self from it by cutting his miserable throat&#xD;
and cheating the law."&#xD;
The master of the 'house thrust back his&#xD;
chair violently, crushing one of Paragod's in-&#xD;
nocent paws as he crouched on the carpet,&#xD;
and overturning a glass which shivered into a&#xD;
dozen fragments at his feet.&#xD;
Irene understood the scowl on his brow, but&#xD;
only'she possessed the clew, and, lazily sipping&#xD;
his chocolate, Hugh'added: " I recollect him&#xD;
very well as a-boy; he always had a bookish&#xD;
look, and I met imn one day on the boulevard&#xD;
at Paris. He was talking to an attachd of the&#xD;
-American Legation as I camel up, and took no&#xD;
more notice of me than if I had been'one of&#xD;
the paving-stones. I could not avoid addhiring&#xD;
the cool sublimity of his manner, and as-I had&#xD;
&#xD;
snubbed him at school- long ago, I put out my&#xD;
hand and said: ' Howdy-do, Aubrey ; pray,&#xD;
when did you cross the water?' He bowed as&#xD;
frigidly as Czar Nicholas, and, without notic-&#xD;
ing my hand, answered: ' Good-morning, Mr.&#xD;
Seymour ; I have been in Europe two years,'&#xD;
and walked on. 'The day after I got home I&#xD;
met him going up the court-house steps, and&#xD;
looked him full in the face ; he just' inclined&#xD;
his head, and passed me. Confound it ! he 's&#xD;
as proud as if he had found a patent of nobility&#xD;
in digging among Belgic archives."&#xD;
" Nature furnished him with one many&#xD;
years since," replied Eric.&#xD;
" Yes; and his coat-of-arms should be jack-&#xD;
ketch and a gallows !" sneered Mr. Hunting-&#xD;
don.&#xD;
Looking at his watch he said, as if wishing&#xD;
to cut the conversation short :&#xD;
"Irene, if you intend to go to church to-&#xD;
day, it is time that you had your bonnet on.&#xD;
Hugh, what will you do with yourself ? Go&#xD;
with Eric and your cousin?"&#xD;
" No, I 'ather think I shall 'stay at home&#xD;
with you. After European cathedrals, our&#xD;
American churches seen excessivelyhplain."&#xD;
Irene went to her room pondering the con-&#xD;
versation. She thought it remarkable that, as&#xD;
long as she had been at home, she had never&#xD;
seen Russell, even on the street.&#xD;
Unlocking her writing-desk, she took out a&#xD;
tiny note which had accompanied a check for&#xD;
two hundred dollars, and had reached her a&#xD;
few months before she left boarding-school.&#xD;
The firm, round, manly hand ran as follows:&#xD;
" With gratitude beyond all expression for&#xD;
the favor conferred on my mother and myself,&#xD;
some years since, I now return to Miss Hun-&#xD;
tingdon the money 'which I have ever i-egard-&#xD;
.ed as a friendly loan. Hoping that the future&#xD;
will afford me some opportunity of proving&#xD;
my appreciation of her great kindness,&#xD;
" I remain, most respectfully,&#xD;
" Her obliged friend,&#xD;
"RUSSELL AUBREY.&#xD;
",NEW YORK, September 5th."&#xD;
She, was conscious of a feeling of regret&#xD;
that the money had been returned; it was&#xD;
pleasant to reflect on the fact that she had&#xD;
laid him under obligation ; now it all seemed&#xD;
cancelled. She relocked the desk, and, draw-&#xD;
ing on her gloves, joined her uncle at the car-&#xD;
riage. Her father accompanied her so rarely&#xD;
that she scarcely missed him, and during the&#xD;
ride, as Eric 'seemed abstracted, she leaned&#xD;
'back, and her thoughts once more reverted to&#xD;
the unfortunate topic of the breakfast-table.&#xD;
Arriving at church later than was her wont,&#xD;
she found the family' pew occupied by stran-&#xD;
gers, and crossed the aisle to share- a fiend's,&#xD;
but at that. instant a tall form rose in Mr.&#xD;
Campbell's long-vacant pew, stepped into the&#xD;
aisle, and held open the door., She drew back&#xD;
to suffer her uncle to limp in and layeaside&#xD;
&#xD;
his crutches, saw him give his hand to the&#xD;
stranger, and, sweeping her veil aside as she&#xD;
entered, she saw Russell quietly resume his&#xD;
seat at the end of the pew.&#xD;
,Startled beyond measure, she looked at him&#xD;
intently, and almost wondered that she recog-&#xD;
nized him, he had changed so materially since&#xD;
the day on which she stood with him before&#xD;
his mother's gate. Meantime the service com-&#xD;
menced, she gave her hymn-book to her uncle,&#xD;
and at the - same moment Russell found thej&#xD;
place, and handed her one of two which lay&#xD;
near him. As she received it their eyes met,&#xD;
looked fixedly into each other, and she held&#xD;
out her hand. He took it, she felt his fingers&#xD;
tremble as they dropped hers, and then both&#xD;
faces bent over the books. When they&#xD;
knelt side by side, and the heavy folds of her&#xD;
elegant dress -swept against him, it seemed a&#xD;
feverish dream to her ; she could not realize&#xD;
, at last, they had met again, and her heart&#xD;
t so fiercely that she pressed her hand upon&#xD;

should see him frequently during his stay in&#xD;

shoulder, she proceeded to the carriage,.where&#xD;
her uncle soon joined her-taking the front&#xD;
seat instead of sharing the back one, as is cus-&#xD;
tomary. He scrutinized his niece's. counte-&#xD;
nance, but it baffled him, as on the first night&#xD;
of his arrival; the serene, colorless face show-&#xD;
ed not the slightest symptom of emotion of any&#xD;
kind. Neither spoke till they approached the&#xD;
cottage on the road-side, then she extended&#xD;
her hand and said, indifferently :&#xD;
"Your European acquaintance, the ,quon-&#xD;
dam secretary, formerly lived in that little&#xD;
three-roomed 'house hid among the vines fon-&#xD;
der."&#xD;
"When I spoke of him this morning you did&#xD;
not mention having known him. 1 inferred&#xD;
from your manner that he wits a stranger to&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" He is a stranger now. I knew him long&#xD;
ago, when we were children, and met.him to-&#xD;
day for the first time in.some years."&#xD;
." There is something peculiarly command-&#xD;
ing in his appearance. He impresses me with&#xD;
respect and involuntary admiration, such as&#xD;
no man of' his ,age ever excited before, and I&#xD;
have travelled far and wide,'and have seen&#xD;
the lordliest of many lands."&#xD;
"Years have greatly changed 'him. He is&#xD;
less like his mother than when I knew him in&#xD;
his boyhood."&#xD;
" He is an orphan, I learned from Camp-&#xD;
bell."&#xD;
'" Yes."&#xD;
She pulled the check-cord, and, as the driv-&#xD;
er, stopped, she leaned out of the window,&#xD;
pointing to a mossy tuft on the margin of. the&#xD;
little brook just at the fiot of the hill.&#xD;
" Andrew, if you are not afraid to leave&#xD;
your horses, get me that cluster of violets just.&#xD;
this side of the sweet-gum tree. They are the&#xD;
very earliest I have seen."&#xD;
le gathered them caretlly and placed them&#xD;
an the daintily-gloved,) out-stretched hand.&#xD;
,he bent over them an instant, then divided&#xD;
JItjtiny bunch with her uncle, saying: "Spring&#xD;

flowerets, and as they now neared the house,&#xD;

"6Irene, my child, it is one o'clock."&#xD;
Without looking up she raised her hand to-&#xD;
ward the clock on the mantle, and answered,&#xD;
coldly:&#xD;
"You need not sit up to tell me the time of&#xD;
night; I have a clock here. Go to sleep,&#xD;
Uncle Eric."&#xD;
He rested his shoulder against the door-&#xD;
facing, and, leaning on his crutches, watched&#xD;
her.&#xD;
She sat there just as he had seen her sever-&#xD;
il times before, with her arms crossed on the&#xD;
table, the large celestial globe drawn near, as-&#xD;
tronomical catalogues scattered about, and a&#xD;
thick folio open before her. She wore a loose&#xD;
wrapper, or robe de chambre, of 'black velvet,&#xD;
lined with crimson silk and girded with a heavy&#xD;
cord and tassel.  The sleeves were very full,&#xD;
and fell away from the arms, exposing them&#xD;
from the dimpled elbows, and rendering their&#xD;
pearly whiteness more apparent by contrast&#xD;
with .the sable hue of the velvet, while the&#xD;
broad round collar was dressed smoothly down,&#xD;
revealing the polished turn of the throat., The&#xD;
ivory comb lay on the table, and the unbound&#xD;
hair, falling around her shoulders, swept over&#xD;
the back of her chair and trailed on the carpet.&#xD;
A miracle of statuesque beauty was his queenly&#xD;
niece, yet he could not.look at-her without a&#xD;
vague feeling of awe, of painful apprehension;&#xD;
and, as he stood watching her motionless figure&#xD;
in its grand yet graceful pose, be sighed invol-&#xD;
untarily. Slhe rose, shook back her magnifi-&#xD;
cent hair, and approached hin. Heicr eyes, so&#xD;
like deep, caln azure lakes, crossed by no&#xD;
ripple, met his, and the clear, ,pure voice&#xD;
echoed through the still room.&#xD;
Uncle Erie, I wish you would not sit up on&#xD;
my account; I do not like to be watched."&#xD;
"Irene, your father forbade your studying&#xD;
until this hour. You will accomplish nothing&#xD;
but the ruin of your health."&#xD;
"1How  do you know that ? Do statistics&#xD;
prove astronomers short-lived ? Rather the&#xD;
contrary. I commend you to the contempla-&#xD;
tion of their longevity. Good-night, Uncle ;&#xD;
starry dreams to you."&#xD;
" Stay, child ; what object have you in view&#xD;
in all this laborious investigation ?"&#xD;
Are you sceptical of the possibility of a&#xD;
devotion to science merely for science's sake ?&#xD;
Do my womanly garments shut me out of the&#xD;
holy of Holies, debar me eternally from sacred&#xD;
arcana, think you t Uncle Eric, once for all,&#xD;
it is not my aim to-&#xD;
brush with extreme flounce&#xD;
The circle of thelciences.e"&#xD;
I take my heart, my intellect, my- life, and&#xD;
offer all upon the altar of its penetralia. You&#xD;
men doubt women's credentials for work like&#xD;
mine ; but this intellectual bigotry and mo-&#xD;
nopoly already trembles before the weigh of&#xD;
stern and positive results which women lay&#xD;
before fou-data for your sp'eculationa-alms&#xD;
&#xD;
for your calculation. In glorious attestation&#xD;
of the truth of female capacity to grapple with&#xD;
some of the most recondite problems of science&#xD;
stand the names of Caroline Herschel, Mary&#xD;
Sommerville, Maria Mitchel, Emma Willard,&#xD;
Mrs. Phelps, and the proud compliment paid&#xD;
to Madame Lepaute by Clairant and Lalande,&#xD;
who, at the successful conclusion of their&#xD;
gigantic computations, declared: 'The assist-&#xD;
ance rendered by her was such that, without&#xD;
her, we never should have dared to undertake&#xD;
the enormous labor in which it was necessary&#xD;
to calculate the distance of each of the two&#xD;
planets, Jupiter and Saturn, from the comet,&#xD;
separately for every degree, for one hundred&#xD;
and fifty years.' Uncle Eric, remember-&#xD;
'"--Wihcso cures the plague,&#xD;
Though twice a we en. duni io'called a leech&#xD;
ho rights a find's fuiances is exc used&#xD;
For touching coppers, though her hands be white.'"&#xD;
She took the volume she had been reading,&#xD;
selected several catalogues from the mass, and,&#xD;
lighting a small lamp, passed her uncle and&#xD;
mounted the spiral staircase leading to the&#xD;
observatory. He watched her tall form slowly&#xD;
ascending, and, in the flashing light of the&#xD;
lamp she carried, her black dress and floating&#xD;
hair seemed to belong to some veritable Ura-&#xD;
nia-some ancient Egyptic Berenice.    He&#xD;
heard her open the glass door of the observa-&#xD;
tory, then the flame vanished, and the click of&#xD;
the lock fell down the dark stairway as she&#xD;
turned the key. , With a heavy sigh the crip-,&#xD;
pie returned to his room, there to ponder the&#xD;
singular character of the woman whom he had&#xD;
just left, and to dream that he saw her trans-&#xD;
planted to the constellations, her blue eyes&#xD;
brightening into stars, her waving hair braid-'&#xD;
-ing itself out into brilliant, rushing comets.&#xD;
The night was keen, still, and cloudless, and,&#xD;
as Irene locked herself in, the chill from the&#xD;
marble tiles crept through the carpet to her&#xD;
slippered feet. In -the centre of the apart-&#xD;
ment rose a wooden shaft bearing a brass&#xD;
plate, and to this a telescope was securely&#xD;
fastened. 'Two chairs and an old-fashioned&#xD;
oaken table, with curious carved legs, com-&#xD;
prised the furniture. She looked at the small&#xD;
siderial clock, and finding that a quarter of an&#xD;
hour must elapse before she cou d make the&#xD;
desired observation, drew a chair to the table&#xD;
and seated herself. She took from the drawer&#xD;
a number of loose papers, and prepared the,&#xD;
blank-book for registering the observation;&#xD;
then laid before Tier: a slate covered with&#xD;
figures, and began to run over the calculation.&#xD;
At the close of fifteen minutes she placed her-&#xD;
self at the telescope, and waited patiently .for&#xD;
the appearance of a small star which gradu-&#xD;
ally entered the field; she noted the exact&#xD;
moment and position, transferred the reist&#xD;
to the register, and after a time went back to&#xD;
slate and figures. Cautiously she went over&#xD;
the work, now and then having recourse to&#xD;
pen and paper; she reached the bottom of the&#xD;

in this large, airy house of oprs to accommo-&#xD;
date' my mother's brother ? I thought 'it was&#xD;
fully settled that you were to reside with' us.&#xD;
There is no good reason why you should not.&#xD;
Obviously, we have a better claim upon you&#xD;
than anybody else; why doom yourself to the1&#xD;
loneliness of a separate household ?  Recon-I&#xD;
sider the matter."'&#xD;
"Noertenter. it is better that I should have.&#xD;
a quiet little home of my own, free from the in-&#xD;
evitable restraint incident to residing. 'under&#xD;
the roof of another. My recluse 'nature and&#xD;
habits unfit me for the gay young associates&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
who throng this house, making earnival-time&#xD;
of all seasons."&#xD;
" I will change the library, and give you two,&#xD;
robms on this floor,,.to avoid stair-steps; I will&#xD;
build you a wall of partition, and have your&#xD;
doors and windows hermetically sealed against&#xD;
intrusion. No sound of billiard-balls or dan-&#xD;
cing feet, or noisy laughter.shall invade your&#xD;
sanctuary. Not St. Simeon, of isolated memo-&#xD;
ry, could desire more complete seclusion and&#xD;
solitude than that with which I shall indulge&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" It is advisable that I should go."&#xD;
"I appreciate neither the expediency nor&#xD;
necessity."&#xD;
" Like all other crusty, self-indulgent bache-&#xD;
lors, I have many whims,.which I certainly do&#xD;
not expect people to bear patiently."&#xD;
" You are neither crusty nor self-indulgent,&#xD;
that I have discovered ; as for your whims, I&#xD;
have large charity, and will humor them."&#xD;
" Irene, I want a house of my own, to, which&#xD;
I can feel privileged to invite such guests, such&#xD;
companions, as I-deem congenial, irrespective&#xD;
of the fiats of,,would-be sbeial autocrats and&#xD;
the social ostracism of certain cliques."&#xD;
She was silent a moment, 'but met his;keen&#xD;
look without the slightest embarrassment, and&#xD;
yet when she ,spoke he knew, from her eyes&#xD;
and voice, that she fully comprehended his&#xD;
meaning.   "&#xD;
" Of course, it is a matter which you must&#xD;
determine for yourself.  You .ae .the best&#xD;
judge of what conduces to your happiness;&#xD;
but I am sorry, very'sorry, Uncle Eric, that, in&#xD;

move from 'our domestic circle. I shall miss&#xD;
you painfully."&#xD;
" Pardon me, but I doubt the last clause.&#xD;
You lean on no one sufficiently to note thesab-&#xD;
sence of their support."&#xD;
"Do you'recognize no difference between&#xD;
a parasitic clinging and an affectionate friend-&#xD;

"4Uncle Eric, is it utterly useless for me to&#xD;

Very near the cottage formerly occupied by&#xD;
Mrs. Aubrey stood a small brick house, par-&#xD;
tially concealed by'poplarand sycamore trees,&#xD;
and surrounded by a heat, well-arranged flow-&#xD;
er-garden. This was the place selected and&#xD;
purchased by the cripple for his future home.&#xD;
Mr. Huntingdon had opposed the -whale pro-&#xD;
ceeding, and invited his brother-in-law  to&#xD;
reside with him; but beneath the cordial sur-&#xD;
face the guest felt that other sentiments rolled&#xD;
deep and strong. He had little in common&#xD;
with his sister's husband, and only a warm and&#xD;
increasing affection for his niece now induced&#xD;
him to ettle in W -  .  Some necessary'&#xD;
repairs had been made, some requisite arrange-&#xD;
ments..completed' regarding seatst, and to-&#xD;
day the 'finishing touches were given to the&#xD;
snug little bachelor establishment. When it&#xD;
was, apparent that no arguments would avail&#xD;
to alter the decision, Irene -ceased to speak of&#xD;
it, and busied herself in various undertakings&#xD;
to' promote her uncle's' comfort. She made&#xD;
pretty *hite curtains-for his library-windows,&#xD;
knitted bright-colored worsted larAp-mats, and&#xD;
hemmed and marked the contents of the linen-&#xD;
&#xD;
closet.  The dining-roop pantry she took un-&#xD;
der her special charge, and at the expiration&#xD;
of ten days, when .the master took formal pos-&#xD;
session, she accompanied him, and enjoyed the&#xD;
pleased surprise with which he received her&#xD;
donation'of cakes, preserves, catchups, pickles,&#xD;
etc., etc., neatly stowed away on the spotless&#xD;
shelves.&#xD;
"T shall make a weekly pilgrimage to this&#xD;
same pantry, and take an inventory of its con-&#xD;
tents. I 'intend to take good care of you,&#xD;
though you have moved off,.Diogenes-like."&#xD;
She stepped forward, and arranged some&#xD;
glass jars which stood rather irregularly;&#xD;
" How  prim  and old-maidish you are!"&#xD;
laughed her uncle.&#xD;
"I never could bear to see 'things scattered&#xD;
in that helter-skelter style ; I like bottles, jars,&#xD;
plates, and dishes drilled into straight lines,&#xD;
not leaning in and out, in that broken-rank&#xD;
fashion. 1 am not given to boasting, but I will&#xD;
say that no housekeeper can show a nicer,&#xD;
neater pantry than my o n."&#xD;
" What have you in that basket ?"&#xD;
" Flowers from the greenhouse. Come into&#xD;
the library, and let me dress your new vases."&#xD;
He followed her into the next room,'and&#xD;
watched her as she leisurely and tastefully&#xD;
disposed her flowers; now searching the basket&#xD;
for a sprig of evergreen, and now bending ob-&#xD;
stinate stems to make stiff clusters lean loving-&#xD;
ly to each other. Placing the vases on the&#xD;
mantle, she stepped back to inspect the effect,&#xD;
and said, gravely :&#xD;
" How beautiful they are ! Let me always&#xD;
dress your vases, Uncle. Women have a knack&#xD;
of intertwining stems and grouping colors; our&#xD;
fingers were ordained for all such embroidery&#xD;
on the carse gray serge of stern, practical&#xD;
every-day'life. You men are more at home&#xD;
with state ; papers, machine-shops, 'navies,&#xD;
armies, political economy, and - agricultural&#xD;
chemistry than with fragile azaleas and golden-&#xD;
dusted lilies."&#xD;
Before he could-reply she turned and asked:&#xD;
" What do these large square boxes in the&#xD;
hall contain ?".-&#xD;
" Books which I gathered in Europe and&#xD;
selected in New York ; among them many&#xD;
rare old volumes, which you have never seen.'&#xD;
Come down next Monday, and help me 'to&#xD;
number and shelve them; afterward, we will&#xD;
read them together. Lay aside your bonnet,&#xD;
and sped the evening with me."&#xD;
No, I must go back ; Hugh sent. me word&#xD;
that he' would bring company to tea."&#xD;
He took her hand and drew her close.to his&#xD;
chair, saying gently:&#xD;
"Ah, Irene ! I wish I 'could keep you al-&#xD;

there contented-looking cows, with glossy satin&#xD;
skins, sauntered homeward-taking the road&#xD;
with as much precision as their Swiss sisters to&#xD;
the tune of Ranz des Vaches; the broad river&#xD;
sweeping down its rocky pavement, and, over&#xD;
all, a mellow April sky of'intense blue, with&#xD;
whiffs of, creamy vapor, sinuouss as floss silk.&#xD;
Close to the margin 9f the' river grew a luxu-&#xD;
riant mass of ivy, and now the dark shining&#xD;
foliage was flecked with tiny rosy buds and&#xD;
well-own waxen petals, crimped into fairy-&#xD;
like cups and tinted as no Sevres china ever&#xD;
-will be.j Urging Erebus into, the thicket,&#xD;
Irene broke as, many clusters as she could&#xD;
conveniently carry; dragged a long tangled&#xD;
wresth of late jasmine from its seclusion, fast-&#xD;
ened it across the pommel of the saddle, and&#xD;
turned her horse's head homeward. The'sight&#xD;
of these ivy cups recalled the memory of her&#xD;
Aupt Margaret; they had been her favorite&#xD;
flowers and as' thought now 'took another&#xD;
channel, she directed her way to the grave-&#xD;
yard., She always rode rapidly, and, ere long,&#xD;
, rebus' feet drew sparks from the rocky road&#xD;
leading up the hill-side to the cemetery-gate.&#xD;
Dismounting, she fastened the reins to one of&#xD;
the iron spikes, and, gathering the folds of'her&#xD;
habit ever her arm, carried her flowers to the&#xD;
family. burying-ground. It was a large square&#xD;
lot, enclosed Ey a handsome railing and tall&#xD;
gate, bearing the name of "Huntingdon1" in&#xD;
*  silver letters. As- she approached,, she was&#xD;
surprised to find a lokv brick wall and1 beauti-&#xD;
fuli aew marble monument close to her father's&#xD;
lot, and occupying a space which had been&#xD;
,filled with grass and weeds a few weeks pre-&#xD;
&#xD;
vibus. While she paused, wondering whose.&#xD;
s was tfe new monument, and resolved to ex-&#xD;
amine it, a tall form stepped from behind the&#xD;
e column aid stood, with folded arms, lookiiig&#xD;
e down at the grave. There was no niistaking&#xD;
t face or figure; evidently he was p naware 'of&#xD;
her presence, though she was near enough to&#xD;
,ark the stern sorrow written on his'counte-&#xD;
y nance. - She- glided forward and opened the&#xD;
heavy .gate of her own enclosure; with' difli-&#xD;
culty she pushed it ajar, and with a sudden,&#xD;
sharp, clanging report it swung back, and the&#xD;
; bolt slid to its rusty place. He lifted his eyes&#xD;
s then, and saw her standing a few yards from&#xD;
I him; the ricl soft folds of the Marie Louisse&#xD;
r blue riding-dress trailed along the ground;&#xD;
the blue velvet hat, with its, long drooping&#xD;
plume, had become loosened by the exercise,&#xD;
and, slipping back, left fully exposed the daz-&#xD;
zling white face and golden glory of waving&#xD;
I hair: She bowed, he returned the silent'token&#xD;
L of recognition, and'she moved forward to her&#xD;
s aunt's tomb, wreathing it with the flowers&#xD;
which Miss Margaret had loved so well. The&#xD;
sun was low, leaning upon the purple crest of&#xD;
a distant hill; the yellow light flashed over&#xD;
the forest of marble pillars, and their cold pol-&#xD;
f ished surfaces gave back the waning glaret,&#xD;
1 throwing it off contemptuously, as if sunshine&#xD;
were aC mockery in that silent city of the dead..&#xD;
Sombre sacred guardian, cedars extended&#xD;
their arms lovingly over the marble couches&#xD;
of -fair young sleepers in Gods Acre, and&#xD;
venerable willows wept over many a stela,&#xD;
' whose insilption lichen-footed Time had ef-&#xD;
faced. ,--Here slept two generations of the&#xD;
Huntingdons, and the last scion of the proud&#xD;
old house stood up among the hoarded bones&#xD;
of her a-' estry, glancing round at the mose&#xD;
stained costly mausoleums, and noting the..&#xD;
fact that the crowded lot had room for but&#xD;
two more, narrow beds-two niore silent citi-&#xD;
zens-her father and herself: It was a reflec-&#xD;
tion which she had little inclination to linger&#xD;
over, and, retaining a Ieautifuk cluster of ivy&#xD;
and jasmine, she left the enclosure; keeping&#xD;
her .eyes fixed on the ground.&#xD;
As she passed the new lot the gate swung&#xD;
opeu, #ud Russell stood before her.&#xD;
" Good-evening, Miss Huntingdon."&#xD;
"Good-evening, Mr. Aubrey."&#xD;
The name sounded strange and harsh as she&#xD;
uttered it, and involuntarily she paused-and&#xD;
held out her hand. He accepted it; for an&#xD;
instant the cold.fingers lay in his warm palm,&#xD;
and as she withdrew them he said, in the rich&#xD;
mellow voice which she had heard in the&#xD;
church':&#xD;
" Allow me to show you 'my another's monu-&#xD;
ment."'&#xD;
.He held the gate open,.and she entered and&#xD;
stood at his side. The monument was beauti-&#xD;
'ful in its'severe simplicity-a pure, faultless&#xD;
shaft, crowned ,with a -delicately-chiselled&#xD;
wreath of poppy' leaves, and bearing these .&#xD;

black characters, " esurgarn ;" and, under-&#xD;
'neath the whole, on' a finely-fluted scroll, the&#xD;
,incription of St. Gilgen. After a silence .of&#xD;
.some moments.Russell pointed to thesingular&#xD;
and solemn words, and said, as if speaking&#xD;
rather to himself,than to her:&#xD;
- .I want to say ,Jways, with Paul El em-&#xD;
ming, 'I will be strong,' and therefore I placed-&#xD;
here the inscription which proved an evangel&#xD;
to him, that when .I - come to my mother's&#xD;
grave I. may be strengthened, not melted, by&#xD;
the, thronging of bitter memories."&#xD;
- She looked up as he spoke, and the melan-&#xD;
chbly splendor of the deep eyes'stirred her&#xD;
lieart as nothing had ever done before.&#xD;
"I have a few flowers left ; let ine lay them&#xD;
as an affectionate tribute, an 'in memorial'&#xD;
on yotr mother's tomb-for the olden time,&#xD;
the cottage-days, are as fresh in my recollec-'&#xD;
tion as in yours."&#xD;
She held out the woodland bouquet ; he took&#xD;
it, and strewed the blossoms along the broad&#xD;
base of the shaft, reserving only a small clus-&#xD;
ter of the rosy china-cups. Both'were silent ;&#xD;
bht, as she turned to go,';a sudden gust blew&#xD;
her hat from her head, the loosened conb fell&#xD;
upon the. grass, and down came the heavy&#xD;
masses of hair. She twisted them hastily into&#xD;
a, coil, fastened them securely, and received&#xD;
her hat from him,' with a cool:&#xD;
"Thank you, sir; when did you hear from&#xD;
Electra ?"&#xD;
They walked on to the cemetery-gate, and&#xD;
he answered :&#xD;
"'I have heard nothing for some weeks.&#xD;
Have you.any message?   I am going to New&#xD;
York in a few days, to try to persuade her to&#xD;
return to W-   . with me."    .&#xD;
" I dou   the, success of your mission ;&#xD;
W        'has little to tempt an artist like&#xD;
your cousin. Be' kind enough to tender her&#xD;
my love and best wishes for the realization of&#xD;
her artistic dreams."&#xD;
They had'reached the gate where Erebus&#xD;
waited, when Russell took off his hat reverent-&#xD;
ly, and, posted to the western sky all&#xD;
"aflane." Masses of purple, scarlet, gold,f&#xD;
amber, and pure, pale, opalie green blended&#xD;
in one magnificent conflagratidfi; and toward&#xD;
the zenith tortuous feathery braids and dashes&#xD;
of blood-red cirri, gleaming. through the mild,&#xD;
balmy air hike coral reefs in some breezeless&#xD;
oriental sea.&#xD;
;" No soft, neutral, sober , qraim', there,"&#xD;
said Irene, lifting her hand to the glowing&#xD;
cloud-panorama.&#xD;
He took up the quotation' promptly, and,&#xD;
added:' '&#xD;
"' The Angel of the Sea' is abroad on his&#xD;
immemorial mission, the soft wings droop still&#xD;
with dew, and the shadows of their plumes&#xD;
falter on the hill; .strange laughings and glit-&#xD;

tinsel;,answein to them as they wave. The'&#xD;
coile locks  'hundred-headed       hot'&#xD;

He paused, ano'turing suddenly, with a&#xD;
piercing look-at'his companion, continued:&#xD;
"Miss Huntingdon, 'on what. anvils and&#xD;
wheels is the vapor pointed,' twisted, hammer-,&#xD;
ed, wl irled as- the potter's clay ? By what&#xD;
hands, is the incense of the-sea-built up into&#xD;
domes of marble ?"'&#xD;
I" see that you follow assiduously the beck&#xD;
of Nature's last, anointed hierophant, and 'go&#xD;
in and out .with the seer, even among the&#xD;
cherubim and seraphim of his metropolitan&#xD;
cathedral, with its 'gates of robk, pavements&#xD;
of cloud, choirs of stream, altars of snow, and&#xD;
vaults of purple, traversed by the continual&#xD;
stars."..&#xD;
"Yes; I am a reverent student and warm'&#xD;
admirer of John Ruskin. I 'learned to love&#xD;
him first through the recommendations of.my&#xD;
cousin ;. then foi his gorgeos,.unapproachable&#xD;
word-painting."&#xD;
While they . talked, the brilliant pageant&#xD;
faded, the coral banks paled'to snowy lines,,as&#xD;
if the blue waves of air were foam-crested, and&#xD;
in, the valley befow rose the dusky outline of&#xD;
dark-haired, wan-browed, gray clad Twilight,&#xD;
stealing her'"'sober livers'. over the 'fluslied&#xD;
and fretted bosom of the murmuringriver.&#xD;
" You.have a long walk to town," said Irene,&#xD;
as, Russell arranged her horse's'reins.&#xD;
" I shall not find it long. It-is a fine piece&#xD;
of road, and the stars will be up to light it."&#xD;
He held' out his hand to . assist her ; she&#xD;
spran  easily to the saddle, then leaned to-&#xD;
ward himevery statue-like curve and mould-&#xD;
ing of her proud ivory face stamping them-&#xD;

"'Be so good as to hand me my glove ; I&#xD;
dropped it at your feet as I mounted. Thank&#xD;
you. Good-evening, Mr. Aubrey;, take my&#xD;
best wishes on your journey and its mission."&#xD;
"Good-by, Miss Huntingdon."  He.raised&#xD;
his hat, and, -as she wheeled. off, the magnetic.&#xD;
handsome face followed, haunted her. Erebus&#xD;
was impatient, out of humor, and flew, up the&#xD;
next steep hill as if he, too, were -haunted.&#xD;
Glancing back as she' reached the summit,&#xD;
Irene saw the erect, stern,'solitary figurevat,-&#xD;

Once more, as in childhood, she hea-d the&#xD;

little irresponsible children parties to a thor-&#xD;
oughly selfish, ignoble contract, which is re-&#xD;
volting to me. Your future and mine were&#xD;
adumbrated from my cradle, and that which&#xD;
only we could legitimately decide was usurped&#xD;
and predetermined. You have known, for&#xD;

I have no sympathy wi h your pursuits, you&#xD;
are invariably afflicted with ennui at the bare&#xD;
suggestion of mine, Nature stamped us with&#xD;
relentless antagonisms of character ; I' bow to&#xD;
her decree rather than to man's, word. -Dante'&#xD;
painted no purgatory dark enough to suit the&#xD;
wretchedness that would result from sucli an&#xD;

"Ah ! I sep how matters stand.'. Having&#xD;
disposed of your heart, and lavished your love&#xD;
elsewhere, you shrink from fulfilling the sa-&#xD;

'he held out her hand, but he was too an-&#xD;
g -y to accept it, and asked, haughtily:&#xD;
" Shall I break this pleasant piece of idfor-&#xD;

you bear me no malice in the, coming years.&#xD;
Good-night, my cousin."&#xD;
She turnedto leave 'him, but he caught'her&#xD;
dress,' and exclaimed, 'with more tentlerness&#xD;
than he bad'ever manifested before:&#xD;
" Oh, Irefie ! do not reject me utterly! I&#xD;

"9 Nb,'Hugh ! no. As well hope to inspire&#xD;

Forgive' me if I pain you, but I, must be can-&#xD;
did at every hazard."  She pointed to the&#xD;
statues near the door, and went 'through the&#xD;
*greenhouse Sto the library, thence 'to the oh-&#xD;
set'rtery, expecting, ei'e long, to b6 joined by&#xD;
hei- father. Gradually the house' became&#xD;
quiet, and, yopressed with the'pairifulsehise of&#xD;
coming'trouble, she sought her own roon just&#xD;
&#xD;
as the clock.sti-uck twelve. Pausing to count&#xD;
the strokes, shgsaw a light gleaming through&#xD;
the keyhole of her father's door, oppoite her&#xD;
owi, and heard the sound of low but earnest&#xD;
conversation mingled with the restless tramp&#xD;
of pacing feet. She was powerfully tempted&#xD;
to cross' the;passage, knock, and have. the' r-&#xD;
deal ended then and there ; but second thought&#xD;
whispered, " Tomorrow will Loon be here;&#xD;
be patient." She entered 'her room, and;&#xD;
wearied by' the events of .the   day, fell&#xD;
asleep, dreaming of the  ' lot in the ceme-&#xD;
tery, and the lonely, joyless- an who haunted&#xD;
it.  ,&#xD;
As she adjusted her riding-habit the follow-&#xD;
ing morning, and suffered Andrew to arrange&#xD;
her stirrup, the latter said, good-humoredly:&#xD;
"So, Mass' Hugh got the start of you? .,It&#xD;
is n't often he beats you."&#xD;
." What do you mean ?"&#xD;
",ie started a while ago, and, if he drives&#xD;
as he generally does, he will get to his planta-&#xD;
tion in time for dinner."&#xD;
"Did Father go, too ?"- -&#xD;
"No ma'm; only Mass' Hugh, in his qwn&#xD;
buggy."&#xD;
In the quiet, leafy laboratory of Nature&#xD;
there is an elixir of strength for those wise&#xD;
enough to seek it ; and its' subtle,. volatile&#xD;
properties. continually come to the relief of&#xD;
wearied, overtaxed brains, and aching, op-&#xD;
pressed hearts. The human frame, because of&#xD;
its keen susceptibility to impressions from the&#xD;
external world, and its' curious adaptation&#xD;
thereunto, becomes, like the strings of an&#xD;
]Eolian' harp, attuned perfectly to the breath&#xD;
that sweeps-it,, and is, by .turns the exponent&#xD;
of stormy passion or holy resignation. Thus,&#xD;
from the cool serenity, the dewy sparkle, and&#xD;
delicate perfume of the early morning, Iren'e&#xD;
derived a renewal of streng h such as no pure-&#xD;
ly human aid could have fitrnibhed. She re-&#xD;
membered now the sibyllic words of the young&#xD;
minister:' "You, too, must tread' the wine-press&#xD;
alone," and felt that the garrients of her soul&#xD;
were taking the dye, the -purple stainof the&#xD;
wine of trial. Doubtless he had alluded to a&#xD;
different ordeal, but she knew that all' the&#xD;
future of her earthly existence was to receive&#xD;
its changeless hue from. this day, and she could&#xD;
entertain but a modicum of doubt as to what&#xD;
that hue would prove. - Returning from' her&#xD;
ride, she stood a moment on the fronthtep,&#xD;
looking down the avenue: The Bermuda ter-&#xD;
race, blazed in the sunlight- like a jewelled&#xD;
coronal, the billowy sea of'foliage, crested by&#xD;
dewy drops, flashed and dripped as the soft air&#xD;
stirred the ancient trees, the hedges were.all&#xD;
alive with birds"and butterflies, the rich aroma&#xD;
of' briliant and countless flowers, the graceful&#xD;
curl of smoke wreathing up from the valley&#xD;
beyond, the nieasured muasleal tinklT of bells&#xD;
as the cows slowly descenaed the distant hills,&#xD;
and, over all, like God's 'mantling mercy, a&#xD;
summer sky-&#xD;
&#xD;
"'As bine as Aaron's priestlyrobe appeared&#xD;
To Aaron, when he took it off to die.'"  "&#xD;
Involuntarily she stretched out her arms ti&#xD;
the bending heavens and her lips moved,, bu&#xD;
no sound ',aped to tell what petition wen&#xD;
forth to tliec'All-Father. She went to he:&#xD;
room, changed her dress, and joined her father&#xD;
at the breakfast-table. Half-concealed behin&#xD;
his paper, he took no notice of her quiet&#xD;
"good-morning," seeming absorbed in an edi'&#xD;
torial. The silent meal ended, he said, as they&#xD;
left the table:&#xD;
"I want to 'see you in the library."&#xD;
.She' followed him  without .comment ; he&#xD;
looked the .door, threw open the blinds, and&#xD;
drew two chairs to the window, seating him-&#xD;
self immediately in front of her. For a mo&#xD;
ment he eyed her earnestly, as if'measuring&#xD;
her strength ; and she saw the peculiar sparkle&#xD;
in his falcon-eye, which, like the, first lurid&#xD;
flash 'in a darkened sky, betokened tempests.&#xD;
" Irene, I was very much astonished to learn&#xD;
'the result of an interview between Hugh and&#xD;
yourself; .I can scarcely believe that you were&#xD;
in 'earne'st, 'and feel disposed to' attribute your&#xD;
foolish words to some triflinginotive of girlish&#xD;
coquetry or momentary pique. . You have&#xD;
long been perfectly well aware that you'and&#xD;
your cousin were destined for each other ; that&#xD;
I solemnly promised the marriage should take&#xD;
place assoon as you were of.age ;' that all my&#xD;
plans and' hopes for you centred in this one&#xD;
'engagement.   I have not pressed the matter&#xD;
onyour attention of late, because.I knew. you&#xD;
had sense enough to appreciate your position,&#xD;
and because I believed you would, be"guided&#xD;
by my wishes in this important affair. You&#xD;
are, no longer a child ; I treatyou as a reason-&#xD;
'able woman,,and now I tell you candidly it is&#xD;
the one wish of my heart to see you Hugh's&#xD;
wife."-&#xD;
lie paused, but she mad , no answer, and,&#xD;
taking one of her hands, he continued.&#xD;
" My daughter, I can not believe that you,&#xD;
on whom I have lavished so much love and&#xD;
tenderness, can deliberately refuse. to accede&#xD;
to my wishes, can disappoint my dearest hopes.&#xD;
Of course, in all that I do or counsel, I am&#xD;
,actuated only by a desire to promote your&#xD;
happiness. My dear child, I have a right to&#xD;
direct you, and surely your affection for your&#xD;
only parent will induce you to yield to his&#xD;
wishes."             .'&#xD;
wHe tightened his clasp of her cold hand, and&#xD;
le ned toward~her.&#xD;
'Father, my happiness will not be promot-&#xD;
ed y. this marriage, and if you ire' actuated&#xD;
solely by this motive; allow me to remain just'&#xD;
as'I am. I should be most miserable as Hugh's.&#xD;
wife; ;most utterly miserable."&#xD;
" Why so?"&#xD;
-" Forreasons which I gave him 'last night,&#xD;
and *wlich it is hardly necessary for me to re-&#xD;
capitulate, as he doubtless repeated them to&#xD;
you."'-&#xD;
&#xD;
"Let me hear them, if you please."&#xD;
"Our characters are totally dissimilar ; our&#xD;
o tastes and opinions wide as the poles asunder ;&#xD;
t- our natures could. not possibly harmonize ;&#xD;
t and, more than all, we do not love each other&#xD;
r as people should who stand at the altar and&#xD;
r ask' God's blessing on their marriage.  ?sup-&#xD;
I pose, sir, that Hugh tells you he loves me ;&#xD;
t perhaps helikes me better'thanany one else&#xD;
- beside himself, but the 4leep, holy, affection&#xD;
which he ought to feel for the woman whom he&#xD;
calls his wife has nd existence in his heart.&#xD;
It will prove mere temponairy disappoint-&#xD;
.ment, nothing seriously touching his hap i-&#xD;
3 ness ; for,' I ass ire you, that is not in'&#xD;
keeping.".&#xD;
" And if I answer that I know the contrary&#xD;
to be 'true ?"&#xD;
" Father,41 should still adhere to my own&#xD;
opinion; and, even were I disposed to accept&#xD;
your view'of it, my own feelings would stand&#xD;
. an everlasting barrier to our union. I do not&#xD;
love Hugh, and-I must -'tell you, sir,. that&#xD;
I think it wrong for cousins to marry."&#xD;
" You talk like a silly child ;' I thought you&#xD;
had, more sense.  Your objections I have lis-,&#xD;
tened to; they are imaginary and trifling; nd&#xD;
I ask you,' as a father 'has a right -to ask his&#xD;
child, to waive these ridiculous notions, and&#xD;
grant the only request I have ever made of&#xD;
you. Tell me, my daugther, that you will'&#xD;
consent: to accept your cousin, and thereby&#xD;
make me happy.&#xD;
He stooped and.kissed her forehead, watch-&#xD;
ing her countenance eagerly.&#xD;
"Oh, Father ! do not ask this of me ! Any-&#xD;
thing.else ! anything else."&#xD;
"Answer me, my darling' child ; give me&#xD;
your promise."&#xD;
.his hold was painful, and an bngry pant&#xD;
mingled with the pleading tones. - She raised&#xD;
her head and-said, slowly:&#xD;
"My father, I can not."&#xD;
-He threw her hand from him, and sprang&#xD;
up.&#xD;
"'Ingrate! do you mean to say that youa4vill&#xD;

and'sorrow from, your birth; but the time&#xD;

no moisture dimming their depths; then they&#xD;
were raised slowly, asaf to the throne of God,&#xD;
registering=some vow, and, pressing her hands&#xD;
over her heart, she said, solemnly:. -&#xD;
" Father, I will not marry Hugh, so help&#xD;
me God.!"&#xD;
Silence fell,between them for several mo-&#xD;
ments; something in that- filed, calm face of&#xD;
his.child awed him, but it was temporary,.and,&#xD;
with a bitter laugh, he exclaimed:&#xD;
".Ob, very, well! Your poverty be upon&#xD;
your own 'head in coming years, when the&#xD;
grave .closes over me., At my death every'&#xD;
cent of my prolierty passes to 'Hugh, and with&#xD;

would rather beg my bread from door to door,&#xD;
prod though I am; I would sooner soil my&#xD;
ILuntingdon hands by washing, or cooking,&#xD;
than soil my soul with perjury, or sell myself&#xD;
for gold. It is true, I love elegance and luxu-&#xD;

I suppose ; but poverty does not frighten me&#xD;
half-so much as a loveless marriage. Give'&#xD;
Hugh your fortune if you wish, but, Father !&#xD;
YatIer ! let there be no estrangement between&#xD;
you an me. I can bear everything but your&#xD;
displeasure ; I 'dread' nothing so much as the&#xD;

Godknows, I-would not have caused-you,,if I&#xD;
could have avoided it without compromising&#xD;

love."    -   '        -&#xD;
She drew nearer, but he waved her-off and&#xD;
said, with a sneering laugh:&#xD;
"Away with all such cant ! I.gave you the&#xD;
choice, and you made your selection with your&#xD;
eyes fully open. Accept poverty as your&#xD;
doom, and with it my eternal displeasure. I&#xD;

You shall find, to your sorrow, that I am not to&#xD;

He pointed to the door as he, had done, years&#xD;
before, *hen the boarding-school decree went&#xD;

and sat down on the steps of the greenhouse.&#xD;
Soon after, the sound of his buggy-wheels told&#xD;
her.:that .he had gone to town, and, leaning&#xD;
her cheek on her hand, she recalled the. pain-&#xD;
ful conversation from first to last. That he&#xD;
meant all he had threatened, and more, she&#xD;
did not question for an instant, and, thinking&#xD;
of her future, she, felt sick at heart. But&#xD;
with the shame and sorrow came, also, a thrill&#xD;
of joy ; she had burst the fetters; she was free.&#xD;
Wounded affection bled freely, but brain and-.&#xD;
conscience exulted in the result. She could'&#xD;
not reproach herself; she resolved not to re-,&#xD;
proach her. father, even -in thought. Hers&#xD;
was not a disposition to vent its griefs. ,and&#xD;
troubles in tears ; these had come to her re-&#xD;
lief, but three or four times in the course of a&#xD;
life, and on this occasion she felt as little in-&#xD;
clination to cry as to repine idly over what&#xD;
could not be rectified. Her painful reverie&#xD;
was interrupted by the click of approaching a&#xD;
crutches, and she rose to meet her uncle-.&#xD;

" I ean't recall the time when it .first took&#xD;
hold of my imagination ; it paced by my side&#xD;
when I was a cild, brooded .over me iin my'&#xD;
troubled: dreams,-looked out from the pomp of&#xD;
summely clouds and the dripping drab skies of&#xD;
winter,-loated on snow-flakes, and flashed in&#xD;
thunder-storms; but I outlined it about a year&#xD;
ago. For my Exhibition picture, I wavere#l&#xD;
long between 'this and an unfinished 'Antig-&#xD;

" And selected wisely. While lb Etirope I&#xD;
saw, in a private house, an .exquisite' head of&#xD;
&#xD;
the ' Erythracen Sybil,' which somewhat ,re-&#xD;
sembles your painting. The position is almost&#xD;
identical--the nose, mouth, and chin very&#xD;
similar; but the'glory of' this,Cassandra is the&#xD;
supernatural eyes, brimful of prescience. It&#xD;
might afford matter for curious speculation,&#xD;
however, and some time we will trace,the subtle&#xD;
law of association of ideas by which two ar-&#xD;
tists, separated'by the Atlantic and by cen-&#xD;
turies, chanced, under totally different cr--&#xD;
cumstances, to portray similarly the two dis-&#xD;
tinct prophetesses who both foretold the doom&#xD;
of Troy."&#xD;
." If such is.the case, the world will be very&#xD;
sceptical of the coincidence. I did not even&#xD;
know that there was an ' Erythrwan Sybil,'&#xD;
much less a picture of her ; so much for igno-&#xD;
rance!. The critics who 'knew that I did not&#xD;
paint your portrait, simply because it was well&#xD;
done, will swear that I stole the whole of m'&#xD;
Cassandra," answered Electra, perplexed and&#xD;
troubled.'&#xD;
."You nee not look so rueful, and' plough&#xD;
your forehead with that heavy frown. -In all&#xD;
probability I am the only, person in New York&#xD;
who has seen the other picture ; and, granting&#xD;
the contrary, the resemblance might not be&#xD;
detected. If you suffer it to annoy you, I sha,11&#xD;
be sorry that I mentioned it. Yet, I doubt not,&#xD;
the withering charge of plagiarism ,has often&#xD;
been hurled in the face of an honest worker&#xD;
quite as unjustly as it would be in your case.&#xD;
Very startling coincidences sometimes occur&#xD;

"Who painted that Sibyl ?"  --&#xD;
" It is not known positively..  Traveling&#xD;
through the northern part of France, I was&#xD;
detained some hours at a village, and employed&#xD;
the delay' in rambling about -the suburbs.&#xD;
Following a'winding road it brought me to -&#xD;
the enclosure of a chateau, and I leaned o;&#xD;
the fence and admired the parterre, which was&#xD;
uncommonly pretty. The owner happened&#xD;
to be=among his flower-beds, saw.me, and, with&#xD;
genuine French politeness and, urbanity, in-&#xD;
sisted'that I should enter and rest myself&#xD;
while he gathered me a bouquet of mignonette&#xD;
and pinks. The afternoon was warm, and I&#xD;
asked.for a glass of water. He took me into&#xD;
the house, and og the parlor wall hung this&#xD;
picture. It riveted my attention, and flattered,&#xD;
doubtless, by shy evident admiration,-he gave.&#xD;
me its history.. IIis father had fouhd it at a&#xD;
picture-shop-in Germany, I forget now exactly&#xD;
where, and bought it for a Dolce, bit doubt-&#xD;
ed its genuineness;.. and my host, who seemed&#xD;
thoroughly au fait in. Art matters, asserted&#xD;
that it .belonged to a 'much earlier school-.&#xD;
That-is all that I or the owner know of it; so .&#xD;
dismiss the subject from your mind." .&#xD;

be true after all, and that the painter's soul&#xD;
possesses me bodily, striving to portray the&#xD;
archetype which haunted him in the last-stage&#xD;
of existence-?  According to Vaughan, the&#xD;
Portpguese have a superstition that the soul of&#xD;
a man who has died leaving some duty unful-&#xD;
filled, or promised work unfinished, is'- fre-&#xD;
quently known to enter into another person,&#xD;

" Did youreceive my last letter, giving' an&#xD;

change which came over .her countenance--&#xD;
the illumination followed as suddenly- by a&#xD;
smile, half-compassionate, half-bitter.' She&#xD;
pressed one hand to her heart, and. said:.&#xD;
"6Mrs. Clifton never seemed to realize' her'&#xD;
son's death, though, after paralysis took place,&#xD;
and shei became' speechless, I thought she re-&#xD;
covered her memory in some degree., She&#xD;
survived him just four months, and, doubtless,&#xD;
was'saved much grief by her unconsciousness&#xD;
of what had. occurred. Poor old lady ! she&#xD;
suffered little for a 'year past, and died, I hope,&#xD;
without paiif. I have the consolation of know-&#xD;
ing that 'I did all that could be done to pro-&#xD;

promised him that I would - not forsake- his&#xD;

attend to my remittances. Aunt Ruth'sfriends,&#xD;
the Richardsons, consented to wait -for me&#xD;
until: after the opening of the Exhibition of&#xD;
the Acadeiny of Iesign, and one week from&#xD;
tomorrow we, expect to sail,"&#xD;
' What do you, know of the .family ?"&#xD;
"Nothing, except that'the lady, who is an&#xD;
old friend of my aunt, is'threatened with con-&#xD;
sumptiori, and ha's- been advised to spend. aj&#xD;
yearaor two in Florence. Aunt Ruth took me&#xD;
to see her the other day ; she seems intelligent&#xD;
and agreeable, and, I dare say, I shall find her&#xD;
kind and pleasant enough."&#xD;
" Since such is- the programme you have&#xD;
marked out, I trust that no disappointments&#xD;
await you, and that all your bright dreams&#xD;
may. be realized. But, if it should prove&#xD;
otherwise, and you grow weary of your art,&#xD;
sick of isolation, and satiated with Italy, re-&#xD;
member that I shall-welcome you home, and&#xD;
gladly share with you all that I possess. You&#xD;
are embarking in an experiment which thou-&#xD;
sands have tried before you, and wrecked hap-&#xD;
piness upon; but I have no right to control&#xD;
your future, and certainly no desire to discour-&#xD;
age you. At all events, I hope our separation&#xD;
will be brief."&#xD;
A short silence followed,,broken at last by;&#xD;
Electra, who watched him-kee'nly as she spoke.'&#xD;
';Tell me something about Irene. Of'course,&#xD;
in a sinall town like '   , you must see&#xD;
her frequently."&#xD;
" By no means. I think I have seen her&#xD;
but three times . since her, childhood -'once&#xD;
riding with her father, then'"accidentalfy at&#xD;
church, and again, a few. evenings before I&#xD;
left, at the graveyard, where she was dressing&#xD;
a tombstone .with flowers. There we ex-&#xD;
changed n few words for the fist time, and&#xD;
this reminds me that I. Am bearer of a message,&#xD;
yet undelivered. She inquired after you, and&#xD;
desired me to tender you her love and best&#xD;
wishes.-'&#xD;
. He neither started fior changed color at&#xD;
the mention of Irene's name, but straightened&#xD;
himself,.and buttoned to the, throat the black&#xD;
coat,-which, from the warmth of the room,,he&#xD;
had partially loosened.&#xD;
"Is she not a great belle ?"&#xD;
".I. presume few women have been more ad-&#xD;
mired than she is. .I hear much of her beauty&#xD;
'and the sensation which it creates wherever&#xD;
she.goes ; but the number of her suitors is&#xD;
probably limited, front the fast that it is gener-&#xD;
ally known she is engaged to her cousin, young&#xD;
Seymour."&#xD;
"'I can not believe that she loves him."&#xD;
"Â«Oh i that is not necessary to 'latter-day&#xD;
matrimonial contracts; it is an obsolete clause,&#xD;
net 'essential to legality, and utterly ignored.,&#xD;
She is bound-. hand atnd foot, and her. father&#xD;
will, immolate her on the altar of Mehxey."' -&#xD;
He smiled bitterly, and crossed his arms&#xD;
over his chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
~.  tI&#xD;
&#xD;
"You mistake her character, Russell. I&#xD;
know her better, and I tell you there is none.&#xD;
of theiphigenia in her nature.":.&#xD;
" At least I do not mistake her'father's, and&#xD;
I pity the woman whose fate rests in his iron&#xD;
grasp."&#xD;
graShe holds hers in her own hands, small&#xD;
and white though they are; and, so surely as'&#xD;
the stars shine above us, she will marry only&#xD;
where she loves.. She has all the will which&#xD;
has rendered .the -name of her farnily prover-.&#xD;
bial. 'I have her here in crayons; tell me what&#xD;
you think of the likeness."&#xD;
She took down a portfolio and selected the&#xD;
head of her quondam playmate, holding it&#xD;
under thelgaslight,,sand still -scrutinizing her&#xD;
cousin's countenance. . He took it, and looked&#xD;
gravely, earnestly, at the lovely features.&#xD;
"It scarcely does her justice: Idoubt wheth-&#xD;
er any portrait ever will.-. Beside, the expres-&#xD;
sion of her face has changed materially since&#xD;
this was sketched. There is a harder outline&#xD;
now about her mouth, less of dreaminess in.&#xD;
the eyes , more of cold hauteur in the whole&#xD;
face. IF you desire it, I can, in one line of&#xD;
Tennyson, photograph her proud beauty; as I'&#xD;
saw her mounted on her. favorite hdrse the&#xD;
week that I left home;&#xD;
'"raultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly nulli"'&#xD;
He laid thedrawing back in' the open port-&#xD;
folio, crossed the room, and took up his hat.&#xD;
"Where are you going, Russell ?  Can't you&#xD;
spend the evening with nm at Aunt Ruth's ?"&#xD;
' "No, thank you; I must go. There is to be&#xD;
a great political meeting at Tammany Hall to-&#xD;
night, and I am particularly anxious to attend."&#xD;
" What ! are-you, too, engaged in watching&#xD;
the fermentation of the political vat ?"&#xD;
" Yes ; I-am most'deeply interested ; nq true&#xD;
lover of his country can fail to be so at ,this,&#xD;
juncture."&#xD;
"How long will you be in New York i"  .&#xD;
"Since I cannot persuade you to return&#xD;
with me, my stay here will be shortened; One&#xD;
of our courts meets soon, and, though M.&#xD;
Campbell will be there to attend to the cases,&#xD;
I, want, if 'possible, .to be present., I shall re-&#xD;
turn day after to-morrow. And now good-&#xD;
night ; I will see you early in the morning."&#xD;
The door closed behind him, and she remain-&#xD;
ed standing. for some time just as he left her.&#xD;
Slowly the folded hands shrank from each&#xD;
other, and dropped nerveless to her side'; the.&#xD;
bright..glow in her cheeks, the dash of crimson&#xD;
on her lips, faded ffrom both; the whole face&#xD;
relaxed into an expression:of hopeless agony.&#xD;
Lonely.as Moses when he 'calmly climbed .Nebo&#xD;

&#xD;
attempt to level never equalize. In all socie-&#xD;
ties, consisting of various, descriptions of citi-&#xD;
.seps, some description must be uppermost.&#xD;
The levellers, therefore, only change and per-&#xD;
vert the natural -order' of things ; they load&#xD;
the edifice of society by setting up in the air&#xD;
what the solidity of the structure requires to&#xD;
'be on the ground.' The day is not far distant,&#xD;
I fear when.European paupers, utterly igno-&#xD;
riant of our institutions, will determine who&#xD;
shall sit in the presidential 'chair, and hove far&#xD;
the constitution hall be observed. These are&#xD;
grave truths, which the enlightened body of the&#xD;
American people should ponder well ; but, in-&#xD;
stead, they are made mere catch-words for&#xD;
party purposes, and serve only to induce a&#xD;
new scramble for office. It requires no extra-&#xD;
ordinary prescience to 'predict that the great&#xD;
fundamental principles of this government&#xD;
will soon become a simple question of arithme-&#xD;
tic-will lie at the mercy of an unscrupulous&#xD;
majority. The surgig waves of Northern&#xD;
faction and 'fanaticism already break omi-&#xD;
nously against.our time-honored constitutional'&#xD;

wrangled away."&#xD;
As he spoke, Russell's eyes fell upon a large&#xD;
oval vase on the mantle-piece filled with rare&#xD;
exotics, whose graceful tendrils were tastefully&#xD;
disposed into a perfumed fringe. Rising, he&#xD;
looked carefully at the brilliant hues, and said,&#xD;
as he bent-to inhale their fragrance:&#xD;
" Where do you grow such flowers at this&#xD;

"'Irenebrings them almost every day from&#xD;

low on the polished neck. The arms and&#xD;

laughed her ugcle.&#xD;

r eo!lection that, " after all, Mrs. Aubrey be-&#xD;
longed' to one of. the M*ealthiest and first&#xD;
fhilies in the Mtate." At first Russell had&#xD;
proudly repelled all overtures, but gradually&#xD;
he was possessed by ,a desire to rule in the'&#xD;
very circle which had so long excluded his&#xD;
fami y. Most folly he appreciated his position&#xD;
'and the motiyes which actuated the social&#xD;
autocrats of; W----; he was no longer the&#xD;
pqor disgraced clerk, but the talented young&#xD;
lawyer, and prospective heir,of Mr. Campbell's&#xD;
wealth.. Bitterly, bitterly came memories of&#xD;
early'trial,nd now the haughtiness of Irene's&#xD;
manner stung him as nothing else could pos-&#xD;
sibly have done. He was at a loss to compre-&#xD;
bend this change in one *ho had dared so&#xD;
much in order to assist his family, and proud&#xD;
defiance arose in his 'heart.. It was ten o'clock ;&#xD;
the fete was at its height,; the sound of music,&#xD;
the shimmer of jewels, and rustle of costly&#xD;
llks mingled with the hum of conversation&#xD;
and the tread of dancing feet as Russell de-&#xD;
posited hat and overcoat' in the dressing-room&#xD;
And entered the blazing parlors. The'qua-&#xD;
drille had just ended, and gay groups chattered-&#xD;
in the centre of the room; among these, Maria&#xD;
Henderson, leaning on Hugh's arm, and Grace&#xD;
Harris, who had been dancing with Louis&#xD;
Henderson. As, Russell crossed the floor to&#xD;
speak to the host and hostess all eyes turned&#xD;
upon him, and a sudden hush fell on the merry&#xD;
dancers.          ,,...&#xD;
"dCoaxed at last within the pale of civilia-&#xD;
tion I how did you contrive it, Louis ?" asked&#xD;
Maria.-..&#xD;
"Oh I he declined when I invited him; but&#xD;
I believe father saw hiuM afterward and renew-&#xD;
ed the request. Do observe him talking to&#xD;
mother; he is aspolished as if he had spent his&#xD;
ife at court."&#xD;
"He is ai man 'whom I never fancied ; but&#xD;
that two hours speech pf his was certainly the&#xD;
finest effort I eve' listened to. Caesar's am-&#xD;
bition was moderate in comparison with&#xD;
Aubrey's; and, somehow5 even against my&#xD;
will, I can't help admiring him, he is so coolly'&#xD;
independent," said Hugh, eyeing him curi-&#xD;
ously.   '&#xD;
Â«uslyheard' father.s aythat 'the democrats in-&#xD;
tend to send him to the legislature next term,&#xD;
and the opposition are bothered to match him&#xD;
fully-. By the way, they speak of Mr.. Hun-'&#xD;
tingdon for their candidate. .But here comes'&#xD;
our hero, Miss Maria." ' As he spoke, Charlie&#xD;
Harris drew back a few steps, and .suffered&#xD;
Russell to speak, to the. young lady of the&#xD;
house. Irene stood not far off, talking to the&#xD;
bovrnor othstate, who chanced to be on&#xD;
'udge Hrris and her father werae 'in earnest&#xD;
aiton, hr eyes folowed him as he bowed&#xD;
&#xD;
to the members of the central group ; and, as&#xD;
she heard the deep rich voice above the buzz&#xD;
of small-talk, she waited to see if h  would&#xD;
notice her. Soon Governor G- gave her&#xD;
his arm for a promenade, and she found her-&#xD;
self, ere long, very-near Maria, who was ap-&#xD;
proaching with Russell. He was saying some-&#xD;
thing at which she laughed delightedly ; just'&#xD;
then his eye fell on Irene; there was no token&#xD;
of recognition on the part of either ; but the&#xD;
governor, in passing, put out:his haid to shake&#xD;
Russell's, and asked for Mr. Campbell. Again&#xD;
and again they met during the ensuing hour,&#xD;
but no greeting was exchanged ; then he dis-&#xD;
appeared. As Irene leaned against the win-&#xD;
dow-frame in the crowded supper-room she,&#xD;
heard Charlie Harris gaily bantering Maria on&#xD;
the events of. the evening.&#xD;
' What have.you done with, Aubrey ?.. I&#xD;
will challenge him before to-morrow morhing,&#xD;
for cutting'me out- of my schottische with his&#xD;
prosy chat."&#xD;
" Oh 1 he left a half-hour ago; excused him-&#xD;
self to mother on the plea of starting off to&#xD;
court at daybreak. He is perfectly 'fascinat-&#xD;
ing ; don't you think so, Grace'? Such eyes&#xD;
and lips 1 and such a forehead !"&#xD;
" Don't appeal to, me for corroboration, I&#xD;
beg of you, Maria, for you really gave nobody&#xD;
else an opportunity of judging. Take a&#xD;
friendly hint, and do not betray your admira-&#xD;
tion so publicly, answered the friend, pouting&#xD;
her pretty childish lip.&#xD;
S"1 see clearly that the remainder of us may&#xD;
as well go hang ourselves at once for any fu-&#xD;
ture favor we can expect, since My, Lord&#xD;
Aubrey condescends to enter the lists. Miss&#xD;
Irene, I have not heard you rhapsodizing yet&#xD;
about the new sensation."&#xD;
" I rarely rhapsodize about anything, sir."&#xD;
" To whom does he allude?" asked Governor&#xD;
G--, good-humoredly."&#xD;
" To Mr. Aubrey; who is no stranger to you,&#xD;
I believe."&#xD;
". Ah ! Campbell's partner. I have had&#xD;
some correspondence with him recently, and&#xD;
when I met him at his office yesterday I was.&#xD;
no longer surprised at the tone of his letters.&#xD;
His intellect is one of the keenest in the state;&#xD;
his' logical and analytical powers -are of the&#xD;
rarest orders I shall watch hiscareer with&#xD;
great interest. Campbell may justly be proud&#xD;
of him."&#xD;
If she had felt any inclination to reply, the&#xD;
expression of her father's face discouraged her.'&#xD;
He had joined them in time to hear the gov-&#xD;
ernor's pulogium, and she saw a sneer distort&#xD;

were smashed, buggies overturned, and the&#xD;
police exercised to the-utmost. Accompanied'&#xD;
by a few friends, Mr. Huntingdon' rode from&#xD;
poll to poll, encouraging his, supporters and&#xD;
drawing heavily.upon his purse, while-Russell&#xD;
remained quietly in his .office,.well assured of&#xD;
the result. At five o'clock, when the town&#xD;
polls closed, Russell's votes showed a majoI ity&#xD;
of two hundred and forty-four.. Couriers&#xD;
came in constantly from. country precincts,&#xD;
with equally favorable Accounts, and at ten&#xD;
o'clock it was ascertained, beyond doubt, that&#xD;
he was elected. Irene and her uncle rode&#xD;
down to learn the truth, and, not .knowing&#xD;
where to find Mr. Huntingdon, stopped the&#xD;
carriage at .the corner of the main street and&#xD;
waited a. few moments. - Very soon a rocket&#xD;
whizzed through the air, a band of music&#xD;
- struck.up before Russell's office, and a number&#xD;
of his adherents insisted that he should show&#xD;
himself on the balcony. A crowd immediately&#xD;
collected opposite, cheering the successful can-&#xD;
didate and calling for a speech. He came&#xD;
out, and, in, a few happy, dignified words&#xD;
thanked them for the honor inferred, and&#xD;
pledged himself to guard most faithfully the&#xD;
interests committed tohis keeping. After the&#xD;
noisy constituents had retired he stood talking&#xD;
to some friends, when he chanced to recognize,&#xD;
the fiery horses across the street. The car-;&#xD;
riage-top was thrown back, and by the neigh-&#xD;
boring gaslight he saw Irene's white- face&#xD;
turned toward him, then the horses sprang&#xD;
off. Mr. .Campbell noticed, without under-&#xD;
standing, the.sudden start and bitter though&#xD;
triumphant smile that crossed.his face in the&#xD;
midst of pleasant gratulations,&#xD;
"Go home, Andrew. I know now what I&#xD;
came to learn."&#xD;
.rene sank back. and folded her mantle&#xD;
' closer around her.&#xD;
"Is Master elected ?"&#xD;
"Your father's speech, last week, was most&#xD;
unfortunate in every respect," said her uncle,&#xD;
who felt indignant and mortified at the course&#xD;
pursued by his brother-in-law.&#xD;
" We will not discuss it, if you please, Uncle&#xD;
Erie, as it isentirely useless now."&#xD;
" Don't you think that Aubrey deserves to&#xD;
succeed ?".&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
Her dreary tone disconcerted him, and he&#xD;
offered no further comment, little suspecting;&#xD;
that her hands were pressed hard against here&#xD;
heart and that her voiceless sorrow, was:&#xD;
"Henceforth we must be still more estranged;&#xD;
a wider gulf, fromthis night, divides us."&#xD;
SThe. din, the tumult of the day, had hushed&#xD;
itself, and deep silence brooded over th~e sleep-&#xD;
ing town, when, by the light of the newly-risen&#xD;
moon, Russell leaned upon the little gate and&#xD;
gazed on, the neglected cottage, overgrown&#xD;
with vines and crumbling to ruin. A. sweet,&#xD;
&#xD;
resigned face smiled at him, once more from&#xD;
the clustering tendrils that festopne' the,&#xD;

and debarred from- all hope of afectionate,&#xD;
sympathetic intercourse with her father, her&#xD;
real life was apart from the world in which&#xD;
report said that she ruled 'supreme. She&#xD;
wandered 'in the primeval temples of nature,&#xD;
and ministered, a solitary priestess, at the.si-&#xD;
lent, blazing shrine of Astronomy. The soft&#xD;
" folds of her white muslin dress stirred now and&#xD;
then, and the blue ribbons 'that looped back&#xD;
her braided hair flittered like mimic pennons-&#xD;
in the breeze'; but the clematis bells which&#xD;
clustered around her cameo-pin were unshaken&#xD;
by the slow.pulsations of her sad.heart. She&#xD;
felt that her life was passing rapidly, unim-,&#xD;
proved, and aimless; she knew that her years,&#xD;
S stead of being fragrant with the mellow&#xD;
, itage of good deeds, were tedious and joy-&#xD;
less, and that the- gaunt, numbing hand of&#xD;
ennui was closing upon her. The elasticity of&#xD;
spirits, the buoyancy of youth, had given place&#xD;
to a species of stoical mute apathy; a mental&#xD;
and moral paralysis was stealing over her.&#xD;
The slamming of the ponderous iron gate&#xD;
attracted her attention, and she saw a carriage&#xD;
-ascending the avenue. As it reached a point&#xD;
opposite to the sp6t where she stood it lahed,&#xD;
the door was thrown open, and a gentleman&#xD;
stepped out and approached her. The form&#xD;
was not familiar, and the straw hat partially&#xD;
veilts the features, but, he paused before her&#xD;
and said, with ,a genial smile:&#xD;
"Don't you know tne ?"          -&#xD;
"Oh, Harvey!' My brother! My great&#xD;
guardian angels"!&#xD;
A glad light kindled in her face, and, she&#xD;
stretched out her hands with the eagerness of&#xD;
a delighted child. ' Time had 'pressed heavily&#xD;
'upon him ; wrink les were conspicuous about the&#xD;
corners of his eyes and' mouth,.and the black&#xD;
hair had become a steely gray. He wse not&#xD;
" A little sunburnt by the glare of-lfe,"&#xD;
&#xD;
but weather-beaten by its storms; and, in lieu&#xD;
of the idiosyncratic placidity of former days, a&#xD;
certain restlessness of expression betokened&#xD;
internal disquiet. Holding her hands, he drew&#xD;
her nearer to -him, scrutinized her features,&#xD;
and a look of keen sorrow crossed his own as&#xD;
he said, almost inaudily:&#xD;
" I feared as much ! I feared as mugh I The&#xD;
shadow has spread."&#xD;
"You .kept Punic faith with me, sir ; you&#xD;
promised to write and failed. I sent you one&#xD;
letter, but it was never answered."&#xD;
" Through no fault of mine, Irene ; I never&#xD;
received it, believe me. True, I expected to&#xD;
write to you frequently when I parted with&#xD;
you, but subsequently determined that it would&#xD;
be best not to do so. Attribute my silence,&#xD;
however, to every other cause than want of&#xD;
remembrance."&#xD;
" Your letters would have been a great stay&#xD;
and comfort to me."&#xD;
" Precisely for that reason I sent none. I&#xD;
knew that you must.rely upon yourself; that&#xD;
.I could not properly judge of the circum-&#xD;
stances which surrounded and influenced youi&#xD;
One, at least,.of my promises has been faith-&#xD;
fully fulfilled: I have prayed for you as often&#xD;
as for myself in all these years of separation."&#xD;
" God only knows how I have wanted, how&#xD;
J have needed you, to guide and strengthen&#xD;
me."        .&#xD;
'She raised thetwo hands that still held hers&#xD;
and bowed her forehead upon them.&#xD;
" You had a better Friend, dear child, al-&#xD;
ways near you, who would have given surer&#xD;
guidance and borne all your burdens. What&#xD;
I most dreaded has come 'to pass.  You have&#xD;
forgotten your God." - ,&#xD;
" No ! indeed, no ! but He has forsaken.&#xD;
me."&#xD;
" Come and sit down here, and tell me what&#xD;
the trouble is."&#xD;
He led her to a circular seat surrounding a&#xD;
venerable oak, and placed himself where he&#xD;
coulC1 command a full view of her face.&#xD;
" Mr. Young, you must have had a hard life&#xD;
out West: you have grown old so fast since I&#xD;
saw you. But you have been doing good, and&#xD;
that is sufficient recompense."-.&#xD;
" I have, of course, endured some hardships&#xD;
inseparable from such a long sojourn on the&#xD;
frontier, but my labors have been so'successful&#xD;
that I forget everything in my great reward.&#xD;
Many a fair June dayl have wished that you'&#xD;

pavements of God's own living green, and&#xD;
dome of blue, and choir of skinless consecrated&#xD;
birds. My little log-cabin in tile far West is&#xD;
very dear'to me, for around it cluster some of&#xD;
the most precious reminiscences of my life.&#xD;

of congenial companionship. I betook myself&#xD;

for, in the twinkling of an eye; I could change&#xD;
this unnatural position of affairs in my home ;&#xD;
only mention-some 'stern facts to prove to&#xD;
you that my hands are tied. It was once the&#xD;
fdndest desire of my life to expend the fortune&#xD;
that I'supposed-belonged to me in alleviating&#xD;
suffering and want and making people happy&#xD;
around me ; but, like 'other dewy sparkles of&#xD;
childhood, this hope vanished as the heat and&#xD;
strife of life overtook me."&#xD;
Shetspoke in a lowmeasured tone; unshaken&#xD;
by'emotion, and' the expression of dreary ab-&#xD;
straction showed that she had long accustom-&#xD;
ed herself to .this contemplation of'her lot.&#xD;
The minister was deeply moved as he watched&#xD;
her beautiful calm features,'so hushed in their&#xD;
joylessness, and he passed his hand across his&#xD;
eyes to wipe away the moisture that so un-&#xD;
wontedly dimmed them. 'He press O her fin-&#xD;
gers to his-lips and said, encouragingly:&#xD;
"'Lift thyself up! oh, thou of saddened face!-&#xD;
euse from yh sighing, draw from out thy heart'&#xD;
The Joyful light of frith' "&#xD;
"You asked me once to be your brother ;&#xD;
my dear child, let me prove myself such now;&#xD;
let me say that, perhaps, it is your duty to&#xD;
yield obedience to your father's wishes, since&#xD;
R     this deplorable alienation results from your&#xD;
refusal. You -never can be happy, standing&#xD;
in this unnatural relation to' an only parent.&#xD;
Because it is painful, and involves a sacrifice&#xD;
on your part, should you consider it any the&#xD;
less your duty ? Has:he not a right to expect&#xD;
that'his' wishes should guide you ?"'&#xD;
She rose instantly, and, withdrawing ;her&#xD;
hands, folded them together and replied, with&#xD;
an indescribable minghng of hauteur and sor-&#xD;
row:&#xD;
" Has he a right to gi e my hand to aman&#xD;
whom I do not love'?  Has 'he a.right to drag&#xD;
me to the altar, and force me to swear to 'love&#xD;
and honor' one whom I can not even respect'?&#xD;
Could you stand by and see your father doom&#xD;
your sister to such a miserable fate ?; I would&#xD;
consent to die for my father tomorrow, if&#xD;
thereby I might make him happy; but I can&#xD;
not endure to live, and bring upon myself the&#xD;
curse of a loveless marriage ; and, God is my&#xD;
witness, I never will!~"&#xD;
Her eyes gleamed like blue steel, and the&#xD;
stern, gem-like features vividly reminded him&#xD;
of a medal of the noble Medusa which he had.&#xD;
frequently examined 'and admired while in&#xD;
Rome. In that' brief flash he saw, with aston-&#xD;
ishment, that 'beneath the studiedly calm ex-&#xD;
terior lay an iron will and a rigidness of pur-&#xD;
pose which he had never conjectured belonged&#xD;
to her character.&#xD;
"Forgive me, Irene ; I retract my words.&#xD;
Ignorant of the nature of the demand, I should&#xD;
not, havd presumed sto counsel you. Keep&#xD;
true to, the -instinctse of your own heart, and&#xD;
you will never go far astray in th'-path of&#xD;
duty. 'May God bless and comfort you! O th-&#xD;

er friends can lend you no assistance in these&#xD;
peculiar circumstances."&#xD;
' He could not.trust hiinself to say more, for&#xD;
feelings too' painful for utterance stirred the&#xD;
depthspf his soul.&#xD;
For "some moments silence reigned; then,&#xD;
standing before him, Irene said, with touching&#xD;
pathos :k&#xD;
"My friend, I am so desolate ! so lonely ! I&#xD;
am drifting down the current of life aimless,&#xD;
hopeless, useless ! What shall I do with my&#xD;
future ?  I believe I am slowly petrifying ; I&#xD;
neither suffer nor enjoy as formerly; my feel-&#xD;
ings are deadened;,I am growing callous, in-&#xD;
different to everything. I am fast losing sym-&#xD;
pathy for the sorrows of others, swallowed up&#xD;
in self, oblivious of the noble aspirations which&#xD;
spanned the early years like a bow of promise.&#xD;
I am cut off from companionship; have no&#xD;
'friend, save an uncle, to whom I could put out&#xD;
my hand for sftpport. People talk of the des-,&#xD;
olation of Western wilds and Eastern deserts;&#xD;
but, ohI God knows there is no isolation .&#xD;
comparable to that. of a woman who walk&#xD;
daily through halls of wealth ard gay salons,&#xD;
knowing that no human being understands or&#xD;
truly sympathizes with her. My prophet ! as&#xD;
you long ago foretold, I am 'treading the&#xD;
wine-press alone.' Once more I ask you, what&#xD;
shall I do with my life ?"Y&#xD;
" Give it to God."&#xD;
" Ah! 'there is neither grace nor virtue in&#xD;
necessity. He will not accept the worthless&#xD;
thing thrown at His. feet' as a dernier ressort.&#xD;
Once it was my choice, but the pure, clear-&#xD;
eyed faith of my childhood shook hands with&#xD;
me when you left me in New York.";&#xD;
For a short while he struggled with himself,&#xD;
striving to overcome the unconquerable im-&#xD;
pulse which suddenly prompted him, and his&#xD;
face grew pallid as hers as he walked hastily&#xD;
across the smooth grass and cane back to her.&#xD;
Her countenance was lifted toward the neigh-&#xD;
borifig, hill, her thoughts evidently far' away,&#xD;
when he paused before her and said, unsteadi-&#xD;
ly:&#xD;
"Irene, my beloved ! give yourself to'me.&#xD;
Go with me into God's vineyard ; let us'vork&#xD;
together, and consecrate our lives to His ser-&#xD;
vice."&#xD;
The mesmeric eyes gazed into his, full of&#xD;
wonder, and the rich ruby tints fled from her&#xD;
lips as she pondered his words in unfeigned&#xD;
astonishment, and, shaking her regal head, an-&#xD;
swered slowly :&#xD;
" Harvey, I am not-worthy. I want your&#xD;
counsel, not your. pity."&#xD;
" Pity'! you mistake me. If you have been&#xD;
ignorant so long, know now that I have loved&#xD;
you' from the evening you first sat in my study&#xD;
looking over my foreign sketches. You were&#xD;
then a child, but I was a man, and I kniew all&#xD;
that you -had so suddenly become to me. Be-&#xD;
cause of this great disparity in years, .and&#xD;
because I dared not hope that one so tenderly&#xD;
&#xD;
nurtured could ever brave the hardships of&#xD;
my projected life, 'I determind 'toquit New&#xD;
Yorkearlier than I had 'anticipated,.and te&#xD;
bury a' foolish memory in the trackless forests&#xD;
of the far West. I ought to have known the&#xD;
fallacy of my expectation; I have'proved it&#xD;
since. Your face followed me'; your eyes met&#xD;
mine at every turn'; your glittering hair swept&#xD;
on every breeze that touched my cheek. I&#xD;
battled with the image, but it would not avail;&#xD;
I i'esolved not to write to you, but found that&#xD;
the dearest part of my letter's from home&#xD;
consisted of the casual allusions which they&#xD;
contained to you., Then came' tidings from&#xD;
Louisa that you were probably married-had&#xD;
longbeen engaged to your cousin;and,though&#xD;
it wrung my heart to think of you as the wife&#xD;
of another, I schooled myself to hope that, for&#xD;
your sake, it might be true. But years passed;&#xD;
no confirmation reached me; and the yearning&#xD;
to look on your dear face once more took pos-&#xD;
session of me. 'My mother wrote, urging me&#xD;
to visit her this summer, and I came out of&#xD;
my way to hear ofrand to see you. The world&#xD;
eers at the possibility of such love as mine,&#xD;
and I doubt not that it is very rare among&#xD;
men ; but, through all the dreary separation;&#xD;
I have thought of you as constantly, and fond"&#xD;
ly, and tenderly as when I first 'ret you in my&#xD;
father's house. Irene,- you are young, and&#xD;
singularly beautiful, and I am a gray-haired&#xD;
man, much, much older than yourself; but, if&#xD;
you live 'a thousand years, you will never find&#xD;
such Affection as I' offer you now: There is&#xD;
nothing on earth which would make 'me so&#xD;
happy as the possession of your love. You are&#xD;
the only woman I have ever seen whom I even&#xD;
wished to call my wife-the only woman who,.&#xD;
I felt, could lend new charm to life and make'&#xD;
my quiet hearth happier by her- presence.&#xD;
Irene, wiill you' share my 'future ?  Can you&#xD;
give me what I ask ?"&#xD;
The temptation was powerful-the future he&#xD;
held out enticing indeed. The' strong, holy,&#xD;
manly love, the noble heart and head to guide&#xD;
her, the firm, tender hand fo support her, the&#xD;
constant, congenial, and delightful companion-&#xD;
ship-all this passed swiftly through her mind;&#xD;
but, crushing all in its grasp, came the memory&#xD;
of one whom she rarely met, but who held&#xD;
undisputed sway over her proud heart.&#xD;
Drawing close to the minister, she laid her&#xD;
hands on his shoulder, and, loodng reverently'&#xD;
up into his fine face, said, in her peculiarly&#xD;
sweet clear voice :&#xD;
"The knowledge ofyour priceless, unmrited&#xD;
love makes meproud beyond degree;.but I&#xD;
would not mock you by the miserable and only&#xD;
return I could make you-the affection of a&#xD;
devoted sister. I would gladly, thankfully go&#xD;
.w-th'yo to yorWestrn hm, and redee&#xD;
my pst byfur et     , a yor wie&#xD;
could not ; and, without the protection of your&#xD;
honored name, it-would not be permitted ie&#xD;
to accompany you. I look up to you as to no&#xD;
&#xD;
f other human being; I revere arid love you,&#xD;
Harvey ; and, oh! 'I[wish that I could pass .my&#xD;
life at your side, cheered 'by your smile, doing&#xD;
some good in the world. That I do not 'love&#xD;
you as you wish is my great misfortune; for&#xD;
I appreciate most fully the noble privilege'&#xD;
you have tendered me. I do not say what I&#xD;
earnestly wish could happen, that you will&#xD;
find some one else who qan make you happy,&#xD;
because, I feel that no tnoman whom I have&#xD;
ever met is worthy of beingfyour wife. 'But&#xD;
I trust that the pain I may give you now will&#xD;
soon pass away, and that, in time, you will&#xD;
forget one who is utterly undeservingof the&#xD;
.h9uor you have conferred on her to-day.&#xD;
Oh, Harvey ! do not,'I beg of you, let one&#xD;
thought of me ever disquiet your noble, gen-&#xD;
erous heart."&#xD;
A shiver crept over her still face, and' she&#xD;
drooped her pale forehead. She felt two tears&#xD;
fall upon her hair, and - in silence he bent&#xD;
down and kissed her softly,,tenderly, as one&#xD;
kisses a sleeping babe.&#xD;
dO , fHarvey ! do not let it grieve you,&#xD;
dear friend -"&#xD;
He smiled sadly, as if not daring to trust&#xD;
himself in words ; then, after a moment, laying&#xD;
his hands upon her head, in.the baptism.of a&#xD;
deathless love, he gently.and solemnly blessed&#xD;
her. When his fingers were removed she&#xD;
raisedther eyes, but he had gone;she saw&#xD;
only the retreating form through the green&#xD;
arches of the grand old avenue.&#xD;
"Unlike are we. unlike,-O princely heart!&#xD;
Unlike our uses and our destinies.&#xD;
Our ministering tio angels look surprise&#xD;
On one another, as they strike athwartr&#xD;
Their wings inpassing........&#xD;
The chrism is on thine head-on mine the dew,&#xD;
And death must dig the level where these agree."&#xD;

'furnishes a melancholy parallel. The regular&#xD;

He was regarded as greater than a private,&#xD;

the exciting contest. The old feud received,&#xD;
if possible, additional acrimony, and there&#xD;
were no bounds to the maledictions heaped.&#xD;

by his virulent antagonist. Many predicted a&#xD;

Mr. Mitchell's health had failed so rapidly,&#xD;

was, that of' Irene's speedy marriage to her&#xD;
cousin. Hundred-tongued rumor was busy,&#xD;
too, with the mysterious fact that, Russell hadI&#xD;
laced a handsome iron railing, around the&#xD;
humble home of his boyhood ; had removed'&#xD;
the little three-roomed crumbling dwelling&#xD;
and planted shade-trees. Much curiosity was I&#xD;

.that he imtende d to marry somebody. Buti&#xD;

ris' and Mr. Henderson's, and, as he had been&#xD;
seen last at the house of the former, by a spe- s&#xD;
cies of not very abstruse ratiocination it wasu&#xD;
finally decided, and promulgated as a social i&#xD;
edict, that the talented young lawyer would&#xD;
soon claim GracO's hand at the altar. In less&#xD;
than  twenty-four hours all of fashionable&#xD;
W-.--h---had discussedd the young lady's I&#xD;
brilliant future, and were ready to tender&#xD;
their congratulations to the ambitious man, t&#xD;
who was utterly unconscious of the commotion -&#xD;
which his individual plans and actions had t&#xD;
induced., This insatiable mania for obtainin t&#xD;
information about other people's affairs and&#xD;
purposes, this ridiculous and contemptible g&#xD;
tittle-tattle, this news-mongering, scandal-ped- I&#xD;
lering proelii ity, characteristic of' cities, towns, r&#xD;
villages, and- even country neighborhoods,t&#xD;
should( certainly have been included 'by their&#xD;
Miassaebusetts seer in his catalogue of "social a&#xD;
inflict ions which the magistrate can hot cure or c&#xD;
defend you from, and which must be intrusted I&#xD;
&#xD;
to the restraining force of custom, a'nd pro-&#xD;
verbs, and familiar rules of behavior impressed&#xD;
on young people in their .school-days.;" and&#xD;
I trust I may be allowed the additional sug-&#xD;
gestion, "by mothers around-the hearthstone."&#xD;
But, unfortunately, the admirable adage, "it&#xD;
faut attendre le boiteux," finds no acceptation&#xD;
in beau monde. .&#xD;
Late, in the afternoon of Christmas-day&#xD;
Irene went into the greenhouse to gather a&#xD;
bouquet for an invalid friend in town, and had&#xD;
almost accomplished her errand when the&#xD;
crash and whir of wheels drew her to the win-&#xD;
dow that looked out upon the lawn.   Her&#xD;
father had gone to the plantation early that-&#xD;
morning, and she had scarcely time to conjecte&#xD;
ure whom -the visitor would prove, when&#xD;
Hugh's loud voice rang through the house,&#xD;
and, soon after, he came clattering in, with&#xD;
the end of his pantaloons crammed into his&#xD;
boots and his whip trailing along in true&#xD;
boyish fashion. As he threw down his hat,&#xD;
scattering the petals of a snowy camellia, and&#xD;
drew near his cousin, she sa* that his face was&#xD;
deeply flushed and his eyes somewhat blood-&#xD;
shot. . . .&#xD;
" Hugh ! what are you doing here ? Father&#xD;
expected you to' overtake him at Crescent&#xD;
Bend ; you said last night that you would start&#xD;
by five o'clock." .&#xD;
" Merry Christmas, my beauty ! I have come&#xD;
for my Christmas gift. Give it to me, like the&#xD;
queen you are."&#xD;
He stooped, -as if to kiss her, but she shrank&#xD;
back instantly and said, gravely:&#xD;
"You ought not to make promises which&#xD;
you have no idea of keeping ; Fat her will be&#xD;
annoyed, and wonder very much what has'&#xD;
happened.' le was anxious that you should&#xD;
go with him."&#xD;
" Oh! confound the plantation ! I wish it&#xD;
would sink ! ,0f' all other days none but Christ-&#xD;
mas will suit him to tramp down there through,&#xD;
mud and mire. The fact is, I did not. go to&#xD;
leep till four o'lock, and nobody ought to be&#xD;
unchristian enough to expect me to wake up&#xD;
n an hour. You may be quiet, though, for I&#xD;
am on my way now to that paradise of black&#xD;
mud. I only stopped to get a glimpse of you,&#xD;
my Sappho! my Corinna ! so (lot homilize,&#xD;
I pray you."&#xD;
Better wait till daylight, [-ugh ; you know&#xD;
he state of the roads and coudition of the&#xD;
bridges. It will be safer, and an economy of&#xD;
tue, to defer' it till morning, since you have&#xD;
made it so late" ".&#xD;
"No; I must go to-night, for I have an en-&#xD;
agement to ride with Maria Henderson, and&#xD;
can't get hack in time' if'I wait till to-mor-&#xD;
ow morning. I want to start- hack day after&#xD;
o-morrow. As for time, Wildfire will make&#xD;
tthe better for the darkness; he is as much&#xD;
fraid of' night and shadows as itf he had a&#xD;
-onscience, and had maltreated it, master'-like'.&#xD;
shall convince him that all Tam O'Shanter's&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
witches are in full pursuit and his matchless&#xD;
heels his only salvation."&#xD;
A shade of apprehension- settled on her face,&#xD;
and, placing the bouquet in a basket, she&#xD;
turned tQ her- cousin, saying:&#xD;
"Indeed, you can not be insane enough to&#xD;
drive that horse'such a night as this weather&#xD;
threatens. If go you wi'l, in the face of a&#xD;
coming rain, leave Wildfire here, and drive&#xD;
one of the carriage-horses"instead: I shall be&#xD;
uheasy if you start with that Vicious, unman-&#xD;
ageable .incarnation of lightning.  Let me&#xD;
ring the bell and direct Andrew'-to make the&#xD;
change."     -.&#xD;
.She stepped into the parlor adjoining and&#xD;
laid her fingers on the bell-cord, but he&#xD;
snatched up the hand and kissed it several&#xD;
times.                   -&#xD;
"NoI I '11 be hanged if I don't-drive my&#xD;
own pearl of Arabia I I can manage him well&#xD;
enough; and, beside, what do you care whether&#xD;
he breaks my neck or not? Without com-&#xD;
punction you broke my heart, which is much&#xD;
the greater catastrophe."&#xD;
"Come into the library; you don't know&#xD;
what you are say ing."&#xD;
She drew him into the room, where a warm&#xD;
fire burned cheerfully, and made him sit down.&#xD;
"4Where did you go last night when you left&#xD;
here ?  Tell me."'&#xD;
" To Harry Neal's ; a party of us were in-&#xD;
vited there to drink eggnog, and, of course,&#xD;
found something stronger afterward. Then&#xD;
we had a game or so of poker, and r--, the&#xD;
grand fnale is, that 1 have had a deuced head-&#xD;
ache alt day. Ah, my sweet saints how shocked&#xD;
you are, to by sure ! Now, don't lecture, or I&#xD;
shall be off like a flash."&#xD;
Without answering, she rang the bell and&#xD;
quietly looped back the heavy crimson cur-&#xD;
-tains.&#xD;
"What is that for ?  Have you sent for&#xD;
John or old Nellie to.carry me up stairs, like&#xD;
other-bad boys sent to bed in disgrace, with-&#xD;
out even the cold comfort of supper 7"&#xD;
"Hush,- Hugh !hush.",.&#xD;
Turning to John, who opened the door and&#xD;
looked in, she said:&#xD;
".Tell William to make some strong coffee&#xD;
as soon as possible. Mass' Hugh has a headache,&#xD;
and wants some before he leaves."&#xD;
"Thank you, my angel ! my unapproachable&#xD;
Peri! Ugh ! how cold it is. Pardon me, but&#xD;
I really must warm my feet."-&#xD;
lie threw them carelessly on the fender of&#xD;
the grate.&#xD;
"hall I get you a pair of slippers ?"&#xD;
"Could not afford the luxury; -positively&#xD;
have not the.time to indulge myself."&#xD;
- With a prolonged yawn he'laid his head&#xD;
back and closed his eyes. An expression of&#xD;
disgust was discernible in - his companion's&#xD;
countenance, but it passed like the shadow of&#xD;
a sumnmet cloud, Antd she sat down at the oppo-&#xD;
site side of, the fireplace, with her eyes bent&#xD;
&#xD;
upon the hearth and the long silky 'lashes&#xD;
sweeping her cheeks. A silence of some min-&#xD;
utes. ensued; finally Hugh rapped startlingly&#xD;
on -his boot with the ivory handle of his whip,&#xD;
and exclaimed: -&#xD;
* " A -Quaker-meeting is no part of my pro-&#xD;
gramme'l What the mischief are you thinking&#xD;
about ?-looking as solemn as an archbishop in&#xD;
canonidals!t"&#xD;
'D.  you really want to 'know what I am&#xD;
thinking of'?"             -&#xD;
"Of course I do, if it is not something as&#xD;
supernal and faraoff -as the stars, which you&#xD;
have taken under your special protection and&#xD;
patronage."&#xD;
" 1 was thinking of a passage which I read&#xD;
yesterday, and wishing that it could be f'ramed-&#xD;
and hung up in'every dwellings Euerson&#xD;
says: 'Goethe said-well, "nobody should be&#xD;
rich but' those who understand it." - They&#xD;
should own who can administer, not they who&#xD;
hoard and conceal; not they, who, the greater&#xD;
proprietors they are, are only the greater beg-&#xD;
gars; but they whose work carves out work&#xD;
for more, opens-a path for all. For he is the&#xD;
rich tian in whom the people are rich, and&#xD;
he is the poor man in whom the people are&#xD;
poor; and how to give all access to the nas-&#xD;
terpieces of art -and nature is the problem' of&#xD;
civilization.' Weighed in this balance, how&#xD;
many of our millionaires, think you, would&#xD;
find Belshazzar's warning traced on their&#xD;
walls ?"&#xD;
" All of which, I suppose, I am to interpret&#xD;
into a polite circumlocutory way of telling me&#xD;
that I am a worthless spendthrift, squander-&#xD;
ing, awqy a fortune which I don't deserve,&#xD;
and a disgrace to my' fair cousinly Lady&#xD;

mire my style of living, why don't -you take&#xD;
me in hand, as is your-privilege, and make me&#xD;
a model of strait-laced propriety ?"&#xD;
"You might, with very great advantage to&#xD;
yourself, take a little common-sense in hand.&#xD;
Of course, Hugh, you are your own master, but&#xD;
it frequently pains me to see you throwing&#xD;
away your life and privileges so recklessly.&#xD;
You might do a vast amount of good with&#xD;
your money, if you felt disposed to" employ it&#xD;
benevolently and judiciously"-&#xD;
" Well, whose fault is it?' I offered to&#xD;
make you my banker, and let you dispense&#xD;
charities for both of us, and you snatched&#xD;
back your dainty fingers in haughty .refusal.&#xD;

"Hugh, be reasonable for once in your life&#xD;

splendid coffee you always have! The most&#xD;

Moorish heart to complain."            .&#xD;
He put on. his hat, buttoned his costly fur&#xD;
coat, and, flourishing his whip, came close toI&#xD;
his cousin.    ..&#xD;
"Good-by,.Beauty. Ihate to leave you.;upon&#xD;

express-train behind time. Will you promise'?"l&#xD;
" To be sure I will ! everything in the&#xD;

sceptical."                     .&#xD;
" Well then, good-by, Hugh, and take care&#xD;
of yourself,   -&#xD;
She allowed him to press his hot lips to hers,s&#xD;
and, accompanying him to the door, saw him t&#xD;
jumpinto the frail open-topped buggy. Wild- .&#xD;
fire plunged and sprang oft in his usual style, 1&#xD;
and, with a crack of the whip and wave of his&#xD;
hat, Hugh was fairly started.        .&#xD;
Seven hours later li'ene sat. alone at the&#xD;
library table, absorbed in writing an article on  f&#xD;
Laplace's Nebular Theory for the scientific&#xD;
journal to which she occasionally contributed L&#xD;
over the signature of " Sabwan.t' Severale&#xD;
hooks, with close "marginalias," were scatteredI&#xD;
around, and the " Mdcanique Cdleste " and 'a t&#xD;
volume of "Cosmos" lay open before her. The t&#xD;
servants had gone 't6 rest;. the house was i&#xD;
very spill, the silence, unbroken save by the g&#xD;
moan of the wind and the melancholy tapping t&#xD;
of the. poplar branches against the outside. f&#xD;
The sky w as black, gloomyas Malbolge; and, h&#xD;
instead of a hard, pattering rain, a. fine, cold t&#xD;
mist drizzled noiselessly down the panes. p&#xD;
Wrapped in her work, Irene wrote on rapidly w&#xD;
till the clock struck twelve. .She counted the h&#xD;
strokes, saw that there remained but one page w&#xD;
uncopied,- and concluded tos fiigish the MS. ti&#xD;
At last she affixed her norn de jlume, numbered c&#xD;
the paves, and folded the whgle (or transmis- 1l&#xD;
sion. T2he' fire' Sas 'still bright ; and, with'no .h&#xD;
inclination -to go to sleep,.she replaced the .il&#xD;
looks qn their respective shelves, Aurned up d&#xD;
the wick of the laip,.and sat down close to the p&#xD;
e&#xD;
&#xD;
LRIA.&#xD;
grate to warm her stiffened fingers. Gradually&#xD;
ler thoughts- wandered from the completed&#xD;
task to other themes of scarcely less interest.&#xD;
The week previous she had accompanied&#xD;
Hugh to 'an operatic concert .given :by the&#xD;
Parodi troupe, and had been astonished to&#xD;
find Russellseated on the, bench in front of&#xD;
her. He so rarely showed himself on such&#xD;
occasions, that his appearance elicited some&#xD;
.comment. They had met frequently since the&#xD;
evening at Mr. Mitchell's, but he pertinaciously&#xD;
avoided recognizing her; and, on this par-&#xD;
ticular nigh, though he came during aninter-&#xD;
lude'to speak to Grace Harris, who sat on the&#xD;
same row of seats with Irene, he-never once&#xD;
directed his eyes toward the latter. This&#xD;
studied neglect, she felt assured, was notthe&#xD;
result of the bitter animosity existing between&#xD;
her father and himself; and though it puzzled&#xD;
her for a while, she began finally to suspect&#xD;
the true nature-of his feelings, and, with wom-&#xD;
an's rarely-erring instincts, laid her finger on&#xD;
the real motive which prompted him. The&#xD;
report of his engagement to Grape had reached&#xD;
her some days before, and now it recurred to&#xD;
her mind like a haunting spectre. She did&#xD;
not believe for an instantthat he was attached&#xD;
to the pretty, joyous girl whom rumor gave&#xD;
him; but she was well aware that he was am-&#xD;
bitious of high social position, and feared that&#xD;
he might possibly, from selfish, ignoble reasons,&#xD;
seek an alliance with Judge Harris' only&#xD;
daughter, knowing-that the family was one of&#xD;
the wealthiest and most -aristocratic in the&#xD;
state. 8te-recollected, with unutterable scorn,&#xD;
the frequent sneers at his blind mother, in&#xD;
which *i ace, Charlie, and even Mrs. Harris&#xD;
had i uiged in the season of trial and adver-&#xD;
sity ; and, pondering all'that she had silently&#xD;
entdurea because of her sympathy with him&#xD;
aid his mother, a feeling of bitterness, hereto-_&#xD;
fore unknown, rose in her heart. True, im-&#xD;
passanle barriers divided them; but, she could&#xD;
not endut-e the:thought of his wedding anoth-'&#xD;
er-it tortured her beyond al expression.&#xD;
With a . suffocating sensation she untastened&#xD;
he caineo-pin that held her robe de chanbre at,&#xD;
he throat,-and threw back the colar.:' Tak-&#xD;
ng out her conib, she shook down her.'hair,&#xD;
;athered it up in her hands, anid-'tossed' it over&#xD;
he back of her chair, whence it fel to the&#xD;
floor, coiling there in glittercihg rings. Life&#xD;
ad seemed dreary enougli be'kore; but, with&#xD;
his apprehension added, it appeared insup-&#xD;
ortable, and she was conscious of a degree of&#xD;
wretchedness never dreamed of or 'realized&#xD;
eretofore. Not even a sigh escaped her ; she&#xD;
tas one of a few women who permit no -ex-&#xD;
ernal evidences of suffering, but look it se-&#xD;
urely in their 6wn proud .hearts, and in' si-&#xD;
ence and loneliness go down into the "ghoul-&#xD;
aunted,". darkened chanmbers to brood over*.&#xD;
t, as did the ,Portusguese monarch the moul-&#xD;
ering :remains of his mutdered 'wife. The&#xD;
'ainful reverie might, perhaps, have lasted till&#xD;
&#xD;
'the pallid dawn looked in with tearful eyes at&#xD;
the window, but Paragon, who was sleeping on&#xD;
the rug at, her feet, started up and growled.&#xD;
$lei raised her head and listened, but only the&#xD;
ticking. of the clock was audible, and the&#xD;
wailing Qf the wind. through the lqafless pop-&#xD;
lars.&#xD;
" Down, Paragon ! hush, sir I"&#xD;
She patted his head soothingly, and he sank&#xD;
back a few seconds in quiet, then sprang up&#xD;
with a loud bark. This time she heard an&#xD;
indistinct sound of steps in the hall, *and&#xD;
thought: "Nellie sees my light through the&#xD;
window, and is coming to coax me up stairs."&#xD;
Something stumbled near the threshold, .$&#xD;
hand struck the knob as if'in hunting for it,&#xD;
the door opened softly, and, muffled. in his&#xD;
heavy cloak, holding his hat in one hand, Rus-&#xD;
sell Aubrey stood in the room. Neither spoke,&#xD;
but he looked at herwith such mournful ear-&#xD;
nestness,' such eager yet grieved compassion,&#xD;
that she read some terrible disaster in his eyes.&#xD;
The years of estrangement, all that had passed&#xD;
since their childhood, was forgotten; studied,&#xD;
conventionalities fell away at sight of him&#xD;
standing there, for the first time, in her home.&#xD;
She' crossed the room with a quick, uncertain&#xD;
step, and put out her hands toward him-&#xD;
vague, horrible apprehension blanching the&#xD;
beautiful lips, which asked shiveringly:&#xD;
"What is it, Russell"? what .is it'c"&#xD;
He took the. cold little hands tremblingly in&#xD;
his, and endeavored to draw her back to the&#xD;
hearth, but she repeated:&#xD;
"What has happened,?' Is it Father, or&#xD;
Hugh ?"&#xD;
" Your father is well,, I believe ; I passed&#xD;
him on the road yesterday, Sit down, Miss&#xD;
Huntingdon; you look pale and faint."&#xD;
Her fingers closed tightly over his; he saw&#xD;
an ashen hue settle on her face, and, in an un-&#xD;
naturally calm, low tone, she asked :&#xD;
Is Hugh dead'?  Oh, my God ! why don't&#xD;
you speak, Russell ?"&#xD;
"iHe (lid not' suffer much; his death. was&#xD;
too sudden."&#xD;
Her face had such a stony look' that he&#xD;
would have passed',his arm around her, but&#xD;
could not disengage his hand; she seemed to&#xD;
cling o it as it' for strength.&#xD;
"  cÂ°1 you let me carry you to your room,&#xD;
or cal 'a servant ?  You are not able to&#xD;
stand.&#xD;
She neither heeded nor heard him.&#xD;
" u;as it that horse ; or how was.it ?"&#xD;
" One of the bridges had been swept away&#xD;
by the freshet, and, in trying to cross, he miss-&#xD;
ed the ford. The horse must have beenfright-&#xD;
ened and unmanageable, the buggy was over-&#xD;
turned in the creel, and your cousin, stunned&#xD;
by the fall, drowned instantly ; life was just&#xD;
.  extinct when I reached him."&#xD;
SSomething like a mnoan escaped her as she&#xD;
listened.&#xD;
" Was anything done ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"We tried revery .means of resuscitation,&#xD;
but they were entirely ineffectual.".&#xD;
She. relaxed her clasp of his fingers and&#xD;
moved toward the door.&#xD;
"Where are you going, Miss Huntingdon?&#xD;
Indeed you must sit' dow."&#xD;
",Russell, you have brought hirn home;&#xD;
where is he ?"&#xD;
Without waiting for an answer, she walked&#xD;
down'the hall and paused suddenly at sight of&#xD;
the still form resting on a gray travelling-&#xD;
blanket, with a lantern at his head-and an&#xD;
elderly man, a stranger, sitting near, keeping&#xD;
watch. Russell came to her side, and, draw-&#xD;
ing his arm around her, made heratlean upon&#xD;
him. He felt the long, long lingering shud-&#xD;
der which shook the elegant, queenly figure;&#xD;
then she slipped down beside the rigid sleeper&#xD;
and smoothed back from the fair brow the&#xD;
dripping curling auburn hair.&#xD;
" Hugh, my cousin ! my playmate ! Snatch-&#xD;
ed away in an hour from the life you loved so&#xD;
well. Ah! the curse of our house, has fallen&#xD;
upon you. It is but the beginning of the end.&#xD;
Only two of us are left, and we, too, shall soon&#xD;
be caught up to join you."&#xD;
She kissed the icy lips which a few hours&#xD;
before had pressed hersso.warurly, and, rising,&#xD;
walked up and down the long hall. Russell&#xD;
leaned against the wall, with his arms crossed&#xD;
over his chest and his head bent low, waiting&#xD;
for her to speak again. But, calm and tear-&#xD;
less, she walked on and on,' ip profound si-&#xD;
lence, till he grew. restless at the strange sound&#xD;
of her hair trailing along the oil-cloth, and&#xD;
once more approached her.&#xD;
" Are you entirely 'alone ?"&#xD;
" Yes, except the servants. Oh, Russell!&#xD;
how am I to break this to my father?' He&#xD;
loves that boy better thanieverything else ; in-&#xD;
finitely better than he ever loved me. How&#xD;
shall I tell him that Hugh is dead--dead.?"&#xD;
"A messenger has already gone toinfbrm&#xD;
him of what has happened, and this distress-&#xD;
ing task will not be yours. Herberti Black-&#xD;
well ands I were riding together, on1our retUrn&#xD;
from T    ,- when we reached the ford where&#xD;
the disaster occurred. Finding' that all our&#xD;
efforts to resuscitate were usless, he turned&#xD;
back, and went to your father's plantation to&#xD;
break the sad intelligence to him.'"&#xD;
is soothing,'tender' tone touched some&#xD;
chord deep in. her strangenature, and unshed&#xD;
tears gathered for the-first time in her eyes.&#xD;
" As you have no friend near enough to call&#xD;
upon at present, I will, if you desire it, wake&#xD;
the servants, remain, and. do all that is neces-&#xD;
sqry until morning."'&#xD;
" If you please, Russell; I shall thank y.un&#xD;
very much.".&#xD;
As her glance fell upon her consin'segleam--&#xD;
ing face'her lip fluttered, And she turned away&#xD;
and sat down ott one of the sofas in the pador,&#xD;
dropping herface in her bands.e A. lttle&#xD;

and Russell came with a cushion from the li-&#xD;
brary lounge and his warm cloak. He wrap-&#xD;
ped the latter carefully about the drooping&#xD;
form, and would have placed her ,head on the&#xD;
silken pillow, but she silently resisted without&#xD;
looking up, and he left her. It was a vigil&#xD;
which she iiever forgot ; the slow hours crush-&#xD;
ed her as they rolled, .the very atmosphere'&#xD;
seemed filled' with the curse which brooded&#xD;
inexorably over the ancient house, and when,&#xD;
at last, 'the eastern sky blanched, and the wan&#xD;
forehead of- the day lifted itself sadly up, it'&#xD;
seemed, indeed, as it'-.&#xD;
" The dim 'red mornI had died, her journey done,&#xD;
-     And with dead lips smiled at the twilight plain,&#xD;
Haltlallen across the threshold of the sun,&#xD;
Never to rise again."&#xD;
Shaking off her covering, Irene passed into&#xD;
the greenhouse and broke clusters of jasmine&#xD;
and spicy geranium leaves, and, thus engaged,&#xD;
her glance tell upon the dashed camellia petals'&#xD;
which Hugh had ruined so recklessly the pre.&#xD;
vious dvenin   They seenied fitting symbols,&#xD;
as they lay in withering heaps, of the exuber-&#xD;

Makes awful lightning." '&#xD;
And she.felt a keen pang at sight of his cam-&#xD;
bric handkerchief, which had been dropped&#xD;
unconsciously between two branching itich-&#xD;
si s. As she 'stooped and picked it up his&#xD;
name stared at her, 'and the soft folds gave out&#xD;
the powerful breath of' bergamot, of which he&#xD;
was particularly fond. She turned -away from&#xD;
the wealth of beauty that mocked her sorrow,&#xD;
and walk on to the library.&#xD;
The fire had died'out entirely, the curtains&#xD;
were drawn back to lit in the dtty, on the li-&#xD;
brary-table the startling !glare of white linen&#xD;
showed the outlines of the cold young steeper,&#xD;
and-Russell slowly paced the floor, his arms&#xD;
crossed, as was their habit, and his powerful&#xD;
form unweariedly erect. She stood by the ta-&#xD;
'ble, halt-irresolute, then folded down the sheet&#xD;
and exposed the handsome, untroubled face.,&#xD;
She studied it long and quietly, and with no&#xD;
burst of' emotion laid her flowers against his&#xD;
cheek and mouth, and scattered the gerani-&#xD;
ums over his pulseless heart.'&#xD;
"I begged him not to start yesterday, and&#xD;
he answered that he would go, if the stars felt&#xD;
and judgment-day overtook him. Sometimes,&#xD;
we are prophets unawares. His star has set&#xD;
--his day has risen! Have mercy on his soul!.&#xD;
oh, my god l"&#xD;
The voice was low -and.even, but wonder-&#xD;
fully sweet, and in the solemn morning-light&#xD;
'her face showed itself gray and bloodless; no&#xD;
stain ot' color on the still lips, only the blue&#xD;
cord standing out 'between the brows,. sure&#xD;
signet of a deep distress which found no vent.&#xD;
-Russell felt2 a crushing weight lifted from his&#xD;
&#xD;
heart; he saw that she had "loved her cousin,&#xD;
cousidnly-no more;" and his face flushed when&#xD;
she looked across the table at hin, with grate-&#xD;
ful but indescribably melancholy -eyes, wlich&#xD;
had never been closed durig that night of&#xD;
horror.&#xD;
"I have come to relieve you, Russell, from&#xD;
your friendly' watch. - Few would have acted&#xD;
as you have done, and for all your generous&#xD;
kindness to poor Hugh I thank you most ear-&#xD;
nestly, as well for my father as nyselt. The.&#xD;
day may come, perhaps, when I shall be able&#xD;
to prove my gratitude and, the sincerity of&#xD;
my friendship, which has never wavered since&#xD;
we were children together. Until that slay,&#xD;
farewell, Russell; but believe that I rejoice to&#xD;
hear of your successes."&#xD;
She held out her hand, and, as he took it in&#xD;
his, which trembled violently, he felt, even&#xD;
then, that there 'was no quiver in the icy white&#xD;
fingers, and that hit name rippled over her&#xD;
lips as 'almly as that of the dead had done&#xD;
just before. She endured his long, searching&#xD;
gaze, like any, other Niobe, and he dropped&#xD;
the little pearly hand and quitted the room.&#xD;
She heard his quick step ring changes down&#xD;
the long hall and stony steps, and, when all&#xD;
was still again, she knelt beside the table, and&#xD;
crossing her arms over it, bowed her face upon-&#xD;
them. Now and then the servants looked in,&#xD;
but crept away awed, closing the door stealthi-&#xD;
ly ; and as the day advanced, and the news of-&#xD;
what had happened flew through the town,&#xD;
friends came to offer assistance and condolence.&#xD;
But none dared disturb or- address the kneel-&#xD;
ing figure, veiled by waving hair .and giving&#xD;
no more sign of life than the form before her.&#xD;
At ten o'clock Mr. Huntingdon returned, and,&#xD;
with his hat drawn over his e) es,-went straight&#xD;
to the library. le kissed the face of the dead&#xD;
passionately, ,and his sob and violent burst of&#xD;
-sorrow told his child of his arrival. She&#xD;
lifted her rigid face and extended her arms,.&#xD;
pleadingly.&#xD;
"Father I Father ! here, at least, you will&#xD;
forgive .me!"&#xD;
lie turned from her sternly, and answered,&#xD;
with bitter emphasis:&#xD;
"I will not 1 But for you, he would have&#xD;
been dillerent, and this would never have&#xD;
happened."&#xD;
"Father, I,have asked for love and pardon&#xD;
for the last time. Perhaps, when you stand&#xD;
over my dead body, you may remember that&#xD;
you hat a child who had a right to your af-&#xD;
fection:  God knows, if it were possible, I&#xD;
would gladly lay'my weary he d down to rest,,&#xD;
here on Hugh's bier, and give him back to&#xD;
your arms. 'Life is not so sweet to me that '&#xD;
I would not yield it up to-day without- a mur'-&#xD;
mur." -      s  .-                    .  .&#xD;
.She bent down 'and kissed her-cousin, and,&#xD;
with a hard, bitter'sexpression min ler cotta-&#xD;
tenance, went up to her own room, locking&#xD;
&#xD;
out Paragon and old Nellie, who followed&#xD;
cautiously at her heels.    Â°&#xD;
"Forvthe drift of the Maker is dark, an Isis hid by the&#xD;
v'eil.&#xD;

them about."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
"Where are you going, Irene ?"&#xD;
"Onlyto the Factory-row."&#xD;
" For what, I should like to know ?"&#xD;
"To see Bessie Davis, who has been very&#xD;
ill."&#xD;
"Fiddle-stick ! I want the carriage myself.&#xD;
I promised to send down to the hotel for Judge&#xD;
Peterson, who is coming to spend the night&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"Of course, Father, if you want Andrew I&#xD;
do not wish to interfere with your arrange-&#xD;
ments. I did not know that you intended to&#xD;
use the carriage. John, tell Andrew to drive&#xD;
the horses back to the stable-yard until called&#xD;
for, and have 'Erebus saddled at once. Un-&#xD;
pack that flat basket I left on the pantry-shelf,&#xD;
and put the things into one with a handle? that&#xD;
I can carry in my hand. The egg-basket will&#xD;
do very well; it has a cover."&#xD;
She went to her room, changed her dress for&#xD;
her riding-habit, and came down to the front&#xD;
door, where her father sat smoking..  , ,,&#xD;
"What are you going'to do with that bas-&#xD;
ket ? Erebus won't suffer you to Carry it."&#xD;
" Yes, sir; he will suffer just what I please&#xD;
to take. I have a bottle of wine,,some jelly,&#xD;
and some light bread for poor Mrs. Davis."&#xD;
"What sort of wine ?"&#xD;
"Not your high-priced sherry or port, but&#xD;
a pint bottle- of niadeira. Tighten that girth&#xD;
for me, Andrew, if you please; the saddle&#xD;
turned the last time I rode.&#xD;
"I 'II bet that you will let that basket fall&#xD;
before you get to the gate, and lose every drop.{&#xD;
in it. It is all nonsense ! sheer nonsense I"&#xD;
She mode no reply,' but 'mounted the beau-&#xD;
tiful spirited animal, who arched-his neck and&#xD;
curveted at sight of the basket. Patting his&#xD;
mane'soothingly, she hung the basket securely&#xD;
on the pommel of the saddle and rode off.&#xD;
" He is wilder to-day than he was when I&#xD;
first bought him; he wil break her neck yet,&#xD;
I have n't a doubt," muttered lir. fiuntingdon,&#xD;
looking.after her.&#xD;
"No he won't,'-Master; she can tame him&#xD;
down any minute. Last week shd wanted to'&#xD;
ride, but he had, got out into the creek-pasture&#xD;
and I could n't catch him. I raced him for a&#xD;
- half-hour up and down, and could n't come&#xD;
'near him; I'tried him wit corn and fodder,&#xD;
buthe ran like a deer. I give it up, sir, and&#xD;
,toi Miss Irene he Was intane of his tantrums&#xD;
and I could do nothing with' him. -''She just'&#xD;
put on her laat and walked over to jhe pasture,&#xD;
and the minute he saw her coming heneighed&#xD;
&#xD;
two or three times, and, before I could get to&#xD;
her, she had her hand on his mane, patting&#xD;
him, and he was rubbing his head against her.&#xD;
Miss Irene can tame anything in this world,&#xD;
she has such a steady, conquering look in her&#xD;
eyes."n&#xD;
Such ,were Andrew's reassuring words, as,&#xD;
with his hat on the back of his head and both&#xD;
hands thrust into his deep pockets, he stood&#xD;
watching his young stress until a turn in the&#xD;
road obscured both horse and rider, then walk-&#xD;
ed back to the stable.&#xD;
It was a cold afternoon in November-&#xD;
And Autumn, laying here and there&#xD;
A fiery finger on the leaves,"&#xD;
had kindled her forest conflagration. Golden&#xD;
maples and amber-hued cherries, crimson dog-&#xD;
woods and scarlet oaks shook out their flame-&#xD;
foliage and waved their glowing boughs,'all&#xD;
dashed and spedkled, flecked and rimmed with&#xD;
orange and blood , ghastly green, and tawny&#xD;
brown. The b0 tic spot- burned everywhere,&#xD;
save on the solemn sombre pines that lifted&#xD;
themselves defiantly far 'above the fevered re-&#xD;
gion of decay. .Royal clusters.of golden-rod&#xD;
were blackened and seared by the lips of an&#xD;
early frost, and pallid starry asters shivered&#xD;
and dropped their faded petals as the wind&#xD;
bowed their fragile heads. The smoky atmos-&#xD;
phere, which had hung all day in purple folds&#xD;
around the distant hills, took a golden haze as&#xD;
the sun sank rapidly; and to Irene's gaze&#xD;
riverr and woodland,' hill-side and valley, were&#xD;
brimmed with thatweird "light which never&#xD;
was on sea or land."  Her almost "Brahmini-&#xD;
cal" love of nature had grown with her years,&#xD;
but a holier element mingled with her adora-&#xD;
tion now ; she looked beyond the material veil&#xD;
of beauty, and bowed reverently before the&#xD;
indwelling Spiritual:Presence. Only during&#xD;
these silent hours of communion afforded by&#xD;
her solitary rides was the shadow lifted from&#xD;
her heart, and at such times 'immemorial Cy-&#xD;
,bele's fingers,.soft and warm, touched the still&#xD;
face, and the icy lines melted. Since Hugh's&#xD;
death, nearly a' year before, she had become a&#xD;
recluse-availing herself of her mourning-&#xD;
dress to decline all social engagements; and&#xD;
during these months a narrow path opened&#xD;
before her feet, she - became a member 9f the&#xD;
church which she had attended from infancy,&#xD;
and her hands closed firmly over her life-pork:'&#xD;
The baffling Sphinx that had so long vexed&#xD;
her sat no more at the cross-roads of her ex-&#xD;
istence ; she Ibund an.uEdipus in the far more.&#xD;
than ca-balistic words:&#xD;
"Thy path isnplain and straight, that light is given.&#xD;
Toward in fulthI and leave the rest to heaven."&#xD;
Sorrow  and want hung out their signs .&#xD;
among the poor of W---, and here, silent,&#xD;
but methodically, she had become, not a'inn..&#xD;
'istering angel certainly, but a generous ene-~&#xD;
factress, a noble, syrapathetic friend--a coun-&#xD;
sellor' whose strong good sense rendered her&#xD;

advice and guidance valuable indeed. By a&#xD;
system.,of rigid economy she was enabled to&#xD;
set apart a small portion of money, which'she&#xD;
gave judiciously, -superintending its invest-&#xD;
ment ; kind, hopeful words she scattered like&#xD;
sunshine over every threshold ; and here and&#xD;
there, where she detected smouldering aspira-&#xD;
tion or incipient appreciation of learning, she&#xD;
fanned the spark with some suitable volume&#xD;
from her own library, which, in more than one&#xD;
instance, became the germ, the spring of'" a&#xD;
joy for ever."  Frequently herfather threw&#xD;
obstacles in her way, sneering all the while at&#xD;
her '- sanctimonious freaks." Sometimes she&#xD;
affected.not to notice the impediments, somse-.&#xD;
times .frankly acknowledged their magnitude,&#xD;
and climbed right over them, on to her work.&#xD;
Amopg the factory operatives she found the&#xD;
greatest need of ameliorating touches of every&#xD;
Kind. Improvident, illiterate,, in some cases&#xD;
almost brutalized,.she occasionally found her-&#xD;
self puzzled as to the proper. plan to pursue ;&#xD;
but her womanly heart,.like the hidden Jew-&#xD;
elled levers of a-watch, guided the womanly&#xD;
hands unerringly.&#xD;
This evening, as she approached the row of&#xD;
low whitewashed' houses, a crowd of children&#xD;
swarmed out, as usual, to .stare at her. She&#xD;
rode' up to a door-step, where a boy of some&#xD;
fourteen years sat sunning himself, with an&#xD;
open book on his knee and a pair of crutches&#xD;
beside him. At sight of her a bright smile&#xD;
broke over' his sickly face, and he tried to&#xD;
rise.&#xD;
41Good-evening, Philip ; don't get up. How&#xD;
are you to-day ?"&#xD;
"Â«Better,'I thank you, ma'm; but very stiff&#xD;
yet"&#xD;
"Â«The stiffness will pass off gradually, I&#xD;
hopt. I see you have piot finished your book.&#xD;
'yet; how de you like it'?"&#xD;
"' Oh ! I could bear to be a cripple always,&#xD;
if I had plenty like it to ream."&#xD;
"You need not be a eripple ; but there are&#xD;
plenty more, just as good and better, which&#xD;
you shall have in time. Do you think you&#xD;
could hold my horse for me a httle while? I&#xD;
can't find a suitable place to tie him. lie is&#xD;
gentle enough if you will only hold the reins."&#xD;
"4Certainy, ma'm; I shall be glad to hold&#xD;
him as long as-you like."            ,&#xD;
She dismounted, and, taking her'basket,&#xD;
placed the bridle in the boy's hand, saying en-&#xD;
couragingly, as Erebus put up his ears aird&#xD;
looked vicious:&#xD;
"6Don't be afraid 'of him. Speak to him&#xD;
quietly, if he gets restless, and ifyou can't&#xD;
keep hin in order, call me; I am going in next&#xD;
door."  :  ".&#xD;
He smiled assent,'wrapped the bridle round&#xD;
his wrist, and returned eagerly to is treasure,&#xD;
Sims' " Life of Nathaniel Greene," while&#xD;
Irene passed into the adjoining hopise. Soein&#xD;
sick-rooms are- inviting, from thie costly display&#xD;
of marble, rosewood, velvet, and silver; from&#xD;
&#xD;
tJe tasteful arrangement of books and flowers ;&#xD;
from the air of delicacy and affectionate con-&#xD;
sideration which pervades them. But those&#xD;
where -poverty stands grim and gaunt on the&#xD;
hearth are rarely enticing, and to this dreary&#xD;
class belonged the room where Bessie Davis&#xD;
had suffered for months, watching the sands of&#xD;
life run low and the shadow of death growing&#xD;
longer across the threshold day by day. The&#xD;
(lust and lint of the cotton-room had choked&#xD;
the springs of life, and on her hollow cheeks&#xD;
glowed the autograph of. consumption. She&#xD;
stretched out her wasted hand and said :&#xD;
" Ali, Miss Irene !. I heard your voice out-&#xD;
side, and it was pleasant to my ears as the&#xD;
sound of the bell when work-hours are over.&#xD;
I am always glad to see your face, but this&#xD;
evening [ was longing for you, hoping and&#xD;
praying that you would come. I am in trouble."&#xD;
"About what, Mrs. Davis? Nothing seri-&#xD;
ous, I hope ; tell me."&#xD;
"I don't know how serious it is going tobe.&#xD;
Johnnie is sick in the next room, take .yes-&#xD;
terday; and, about-noon to-day, Susan lead to&#xD;
kn'oek off work and come home. Hester is the&#xD;
only one left, and you-know she is but a baby&#xD;
to work. I don't like to complain o( my lot,&#xD;
'God knows, but it seems hard if we are all to&#xD;
be taken down."&#xD;
" I hope they will not be sick long. What&#xD;
is the matter with Johnnie ?"'       -&#xD;
"'Dear knows! I am sure I don't; he com-&#xD;
plains of the headache and has fever, and&#xD;
Susan here seems ailing the same way. She&#xD;
is as stupid as can be-sleeps-all the time. My&#xD;
children have had measles and whooping-&#xD;
cough and chicken-pox and scarlet-fever, and&#xD;
I can't imagine what they are trying to catch&#xD;
now. I hear that there is a deal of sickness&#xD;
showing itself in the Row."&#xD;
" Have you sent for the doctor ?" asked&#xD;
Irhne, walking around to the other side of the&#xD;
bed and examining Susan's pulse.&#xD;
",Yes, I sent Il"ster ; but she said lie told&#xD;
her he was too busy to come."&#xD;
" Why did you not apply to some other&#xD;
physician ?".&#xD;
" Because Dr. Brandon has always attended&#xD;
me, and, as I sent for him first, I did n't know&#xD;
whether any other 'doctor would Like to come.&#xD;
You know some. of them have very curious&#xD;
notions about their dignity."&#xD;

" Thank you ; I will save it for my Johnnie,&#xD;
he is so fond of sweet things; and, poor child!&#xD;
he sees 'em so seldom now-a-days."&#xD;
" There is enough for you and Johnnie too.&#xD;
Eat this, while, I look after him.'and see&#xD;
whether he ought to have any this evening."&#xD;
She placed a saucer filled with the tmpt-&#xD;
ing amber-hueds delicacy on the little ,pine&#xD;
table beside the bed and went into the next&#xD;
room. The boy, who looked about seven or&#xD;
eight years old, lay on a pallet in one corner,&#xD;
restless and fretful, his cheeks burning and his&#xD;
large brown eyes sparkling with fever.&#xD;
"Johnnie, boy I what is the, matter ? TellI&#xD;
me what hurts you ?"              -&#xD;
" My head aches so badly," and tears came&#xD;
to-the beautiful childish eyes.&#xD;
"It feels hot. Would you like to have it&#xD;
bahedin cold water ?"1&#xD;
'If you please, ma'm. I have been calling&#xD;
Hettie, and she won't hear."           "&#xD;
" Because she has gone out.  Let me see if t&#xD;
I can't do'it just as well as lettie." .  . {&#xD;
'She hunted about the room for ascloth, but,&#xD;
finding nothing suitable, took her cambric  1&#xD;
'handkerchief, and, after laying his forehead&#xD;
gently for'ten or fifteen minutes, laid the wet&#xD;
folds upon it, and asked, smilingly :    s&#xD;
" Does n't that feel pleasant ?"&#xD;
"Ever so nice, ma'm-if I had some to a&#xD;
drink."                                o&#xD;
She put the dripping gourd to his parched h&#xD;
lips,. and, after shakmn  up his pillow and h&#xD;
straightening the coverinjk of his pallet, she&#xD;
promised to see him again soon, and returned m&#xD;
to his mother.&#xD;
" How does;he appear to be, Miss Irene ? sl&#xD;
I had him moved out of this room because he&#xD;
skid my coughing hurt his head, and his con- a'&#xD;
tinual fretting worried me. I am so 'weak in&#xD;
now, God help me '" and she covered her eyes tI&#xD;
with one hand.e                         se&#xD;
" He has some fever,, Mrs. Davis, but not si&#xD;
more than Susan. I will ask Dr. Arnold 'to, tl[&#xD;
come and see them this evening. This change tv&#xD;
in .the weather is very well calculated to make d(&#xD;
sickness. Are you entirely out 6f wood ?"  fe&#xD;
" Very nearly, ma'm-a few sticks left'"  th&#xD;
" When Hester comes keep her at home.&#xD;
I will send you some wood. And now, how&#xD;
are you?"         '.&#xD;
" My cough is not quite so bad; the pectoral&#xD;
holds it a -little in -check; but I' had another ov&#xD;
hemorrhage last night, and I am growing fa&#xD;
weaker every day. Oh, 'Miss Irene1 what few&#xD;
will become of my poor little childrenewhen I th&#xD;
amgone? That is such an agonizing thought." in&#xD;
She sobbed as she spoke.                 ter&#xD;
"Do not let that grieve'ou now. I    i&#xD;
'you that your children shallube taken caroe f.y&#xD;

and help Hester till Susan gets able to cook.: of&#xD;
I left two loaves of bread in 'the closet, and tre&#xD;
&#xD;

can tout.  I shall go by town and send Dr.&#xD;
Arnold out."&#xD;
l"s would rather have Dr. Brandon, if you&#xD;
please."                               .&#xD;
" Wh ?"&#xD;
"I have always heard that 'Dr. Arnold was&#xD;
so gruff and unfeelig that I ain afraid of him.&#xD;
I hate to be snapped up when I ask a qtes&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
I That is a great mistake, Mrs Davis. Peo-&#xD;
pie do him injustice. He has one of the kind,&#xD;
est, warmest hearts I ever knew; though some-&#xD;
times he is rather. abrupt tn his manner. If&#xD;
you prefer it,' however, Twill see your doctor.&#xD;
Good-by; I will come again to-morrow."&#xD;
As she took her bridle from Philip's hand.&#xD;
the boy looked 'up at her with an expression&#xD;
borderingon adoration.&#xD;
" Thankyou, Philip ; how did he behave ?"&#xD;
' 'ot very well; but he is beautiful enough&#xD;
to makeup for his wildness."&#xD;
xThat is bad doctrine; beauty never should&#xD;
excuse bad .behavior. 'Is your mother at&#xD;
home ?&#xD;
"No, ma'm."&#xD;
"When she comes, ask her I say' please to&#xD;
tep in now and then and overlook things for&#xD;

king too much of you, Johnnie would like&#xD;

"You forget, Doctor; 'greater love bath no&#xD;

She slipped her hand into his and looked up,&#xD;
smiling and calm, into his harsh, swarthy face.&#xD;
"My child, you made a mistake; "your life&#xD;
belongs to me, for I saved it in your infancy.&#xD;
I .cradled you in myarms, lest Death should&#xD;
snatchyou, I have a, better right to you than&#xD;

" I know what I owe you, Doctor; but I am&#xD;
not going to die, and you have scolded me&#xD;
enough for one thne. Do make peace."&#xD;
"Remember, I warned you, and you would&#xD;
not heed."&#xD;
From that hour she kept faithful vigil in No.&#xD;
18--passing continually from one bedside to&#xD;
another. Susan's attack proved comparative-&#xD;
ly light, and she was soon pronounced conva-&#xD;
)escent; but little Johnnie was desperately ill,&#xD;
and for several nights Irene sat at his pillow,&#xD;
fearing that. every hour would be his last.&#xD;
While his delirium was at its height Hester,&#xD;
was taken violently, and on the morning when&#xD;
Irene felt that her labor was not in vain and&#xD;
that the boy would get well, his little sister,&#xD;
'Whom she had nursed quite' as -assiduously,&#xD;
grew rapidly worse, and died at noon. As is&#xD;
fequentl observed in. such - diseases, this&#xD;
increased in virulence with every' new case.&#xD;
It spread with astoraishing celerity through&#xD;
the Row, baffling the efforts of the best physi-&#xD;
cians in ,W     ; and finally, the day after&#xD;
Hester's death, as Irene sat trying to comfort&#xD;
the poor mother, a neighbor came in, exclaim-&#xD;
iig:&#xD;
"iOh, Miss irene! Philip Martin is down.'&#xD;
'too. Hie caught the fever from his mother, and&#xD;
his father says won't you please come over"&#xD;
Se went promptly, though so wearied-she&#xD;
could scarcely stand, and took a .seat by the&#xD;
-bEd where tossed the poor boy in whom she&#xD;
&#xD;
had taken such an interest since the accident&#xD;
which crushed his, leg. in the machinery and&#xD;
rendered him a temporary cripple.&#xD;
" He has been talking about you constantly,&#xD;
Miss Irend, and calling- for you. Philip, my&#xD;
son, here is Miss Irene."&#xD;
He smiled 'and turned, but- there was no&#xD;
recognition in the hot eyes, and after an in-&#xD;
stant he muttered on incoherently.  -&#xD;
"You must go home, Miss 'Huntingdon;&#xD;
you are worn-out.. His father can watch him&#xD;
till his ,mother gets stronger," said Dr. Bran-&#xD;
don, who was fully acquainted with her unre-&#xD;
mitting attendance at the next house.&#xD;
" No, I must stay with Philip; perhaps he&#xD;
will know me when he wakes."&#xD;
A hope doomed to disappointment, for he&#xD;
raved for four days and nights, calling fran-&#xD;
tically -for the serene, sad woman w~io 'sat&#xD;
at his pillow, bending over him and laying her&#xD;
cold hand on his scorched brow. On the fifth&#xD;
day, being free from fever and utterly pros-&#xD;
trated, he seemed sinking rapidly ; but she&#xD;
kept her fingers - on his pulse, and, without&#xD;
waiting for the doctor's advice, administered&#xD;
powerful .stimulants. So passed two hours of&#xD;
painful anxiety.; then Philip opened his eyes&#xD;
languidly, and looked at her.&#xD;
"Philip, do you know me'?"&#xD;
" Yes-Miss :Irene."&#xD;
She sank back as if some strong supporting&#xD;
hand had suddenly been withdrawn from her;&#xD;
and, observing that she looked ghastly, Mr.&#xD;
Martin hastily brought her a glass of water.&#xD;
Just then Dr. Brandon entered, and examined&#xD;
his patient with evident surprise.&#xD;
" What have you done to him, Miss Hun-&#xD;
tingdon'?"&#xD;
"t Since daylight I have been giving him&#xD;
ammonia and brandy; his pulse was so feeble&#xD;
and thread I thought he needed it, and I was-&#xD;
afraid to wait for you.'i&#xD;
" Right I and you saved his life" by it. I&#xD;
could'not get here any earlier, and if you had&#xD;
delayed it until I came it would probably,&#xD;
have been, too late. You may call him your&#xD;
patient after this."&#xD;
She waited no longer, but staggered to the&#xD;
door ; and Andrew, seeing how faint she was,&#xD;
came to meet her and led her to the carriage.&#xD;
The ten days of watching has told upon her ;&#xD;
and when she reached home and Nellie brought&#xD;
her wrapper and unlaced her shoes, she fell&#xD;
back on her lounge in a heavy, death-like&#xD;
sleep. Mr. Huntingdon had been expected&#xD;
two days before, but failed to arrive at the&#xD;
time designated; and, having her fears fully&#xD;
aroused, Nellie despatched a' messenger for&#xD;
Dr. Arnold.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
" Do you see any change, Hiram ?"&#xD;
" None for the better-."&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Huntingdon dropped his head on his&#xD;
hand again, and Dr. Arnold resumed his slow&#xD;
walk up and down the carpet. The blue&#xD;
damask curtains had been looped back from,&#xD;
,the western window, and the broad band of&#xD;
yellow belting in the sky threw'a mellow light&#xD;
over the bed where lay the unconscious heiress&#xD;
of the grand old Hill.' Fever rouged the polish-&#xD;
ed cheeks usually pure asalabaster, and touched&#xD;
the parted lips with deeper scarlet, lending a&#xD;
brilliant and almost. unearthly beauty to' the&#xD;
sculptured features. Her hairpartially escap-&#xD;
ing from confinement, straggled in crumpled&#xD;
rings,"and folds across the pillow,, a mass of&#xD;
golden netting; and the sparkling eyes wan-&#xD;
'dered from one object to another as if in&#xD;
anxious search. The disease had assumed a&#xD;
different type, and, instead ofraving paroxysms,&#xD;
her illness was characterized by a silent, wake-&#xD;
ful unconsciousness, while opiates produced&#xD;
only the effect of increasing her restlessness.&#xD;
A week had passed thus--during which time&#xD;
she had recognized no one, and though nu-&#xD;
merous lady friends came to offer assistance,&#xD;
all were refused permission to see her. Mr.-&#xD;
Huntingdon was utterly ignorant of the duties&#xD;
of a nurse ; and though he hanted the room&#xD;
like an unlifting shadow, Dr. Arnold and Nel&#xD;
lie took entire charge of the patient. The&#xD;
former was unremitting in his care, sitting be.&#xD;
side the pillow.through the long winter nights,&#xD;
and snatching a few hours sleep during the&#xD;
day. Watching her now,'as he walked to and&#xD;
fro, he noticed that her eyes followed, him&#xD;
earnestly, and he paused at the bedside and&#xD;
leaned over her.&#xD;
" Irene, what do you want ?   Does my&#xD;
walking annoy you ?"&#xD;
No answer.,&#xD;
" Won't you. shut your eyes, my darling,&#xD;
and try to go to sleep ?"&#xD;
The deep brilliant eyes' only looked into&#xD;
his with mocking intentness. He put his&#xD;
fingers on the lids and pressed them gently,&#xD;
down, but she struggled, and turned away her&#xD;
face. Her bands crept constantly along the&#xD;
snowy quilt as if seeking for something, and&#xD;
taking them both he folded them in his and&#xD;
- pressed them to his lips, ,while tears, which he&#xD;
did not attempt to restrain, fell over them..&#xD;
" You don't think she is any worse, do you ?"&#xD;
asked the father, huskily.             .&#xD;
"I don't know anything, except that she&#xD;
can't lay this way much longer."&#xD;
His harsh voicetfaltered and his. stern mouth&#xD;
trembled. He laid the bands back, went to&#xD;
the window, and Aood there till the room grew&#xD;
dusky and the lamp was brought' in. As.&#xD;
Neflie. closed the door after her the doctor&#xD;
came to the hearth and said,'shai'ply:&#xD;
" I wobld not be in your plac6 for John Ja-&#xD;
cob Astor's fortune."&#xD;
" What do you mean by that'/",&#xD;
" I meain that, if you have any conscience&#xD;
left, you must suffer the pains of purgatory for&#xD;
&#xD;
the manner in which you have persecuted that&#xD;
child,"&#xD;
" In all that I have ever done I have looked&#xD;
only to her good-to her ultimate happines.&#xD;
I know that she-"&#xD;
Sflush, Leonard I'hush ! You know 'very&#xD;
well that you have been down on your knees&#xD;
before the Golden Calf ever since that 'girl&#xD;
opened her' eyes in this plagued world of&#xD;
trouble ! You are no more fit to be a father&#xD;
than I am to be a saint ! You have tyrannized&#xD;
and fretted her. poor innocent sonl nearly 'out&#xD;
of her ever since she was big enough to crawl.&#xD;
Why the d-l- could' not you let the .child&#xD;
have a little peace ? Itold you how it would&#xD;
end ; but oh, no'! you could see nothing but&#xD;
the "gilt face of your bellowijgg' god! You&#xD;
tormented her so about Hugh that anybody&#xD;
else would have hated the poor fellow.'  Mind&#xD;
you, she never opened her lips to me with&#xD;
reference to that matter in her life ; she would&#xD;
have been -gibbeted first. But I am not blind&#xD;
entirely ; I knew what was goieg on ; I knew&#xD;
that the proud, sensitive bird was' hunted&#xD;
and could find no spot to rest upon. ' There&#xD;
are ninety-nine chances to one that she has&#xD;
come teher rest at -last. You will feel pleas-&#xD;
antly when you see her in her shroud."&#xD;
His hard face worked painfully, and tears&#xD;
glided down the wrinkled cheek and hid&#xD;
themselves in his gray beard. Mr. Hunting-&#xD;
don was much agitated, but an angry flush&#xD;
crossed his brow as he answered, hastily:&#xD;
" I am the best judge of my family matters.&#xD;
You are unjust and severe. Of course, I love&#xD;
my child better than anybody else."&#xD;
"Heaven preserve her from such love' as&#xD;
you have lavished on her ! She is very dear&#xD;
to me.   I understand her character ; you&#xD;
either can not or will not. .She is the only&#xD;
thing in this world that I do really love. I&#xD;
have fondled her from the time when-she was&#xD;
a week old, and it hurts me to see her suffer&#xD;
as she has.done ever since you posted her off&#xD;
among strangers in New York. It will' go&#xD;
hard with me to lay her dwn, in all her love-&#xD;
liness, in the grave. My pet, my violekeyed&#xD;
darling I"&#xD;
He shaded his face and swallowed a sob,&#xD;
and for some moments neither spoke. After a.&#xD;
while the doctor buttoned up his coat and'took&#xD;
his hat.&#xD;
"I am going down to my office to get a dif-&#xD;
ferent prescription.' I will be back soon."&#xD;
"Mrs. Harris and Mrs. Clark'said that they&#xD;
would sit up to-night. Hiram, you must be'&#xD;
worn-out, losing so much sleep."&#xD;
"Tell Mrs. Harris and Mrs. Clark to go to&#xD;
Egypt ! Po you suppose I want two such&#xD;
gossip-hawks perched over my dove? I am&#xD;
going to sit up myself. .Give Irene a spoonfi1&#xD;
of that mixture in. the small vial at seven&#xD;
o'clock."&#xD;
C ontrary to hisphlegmatic habit, the doctor&#xD;
had. taken counsel of his fears until he tras&#xD;

than usually surly and snappish. As he en-&#xD;

from the window,' whence, for nearly an hour,&#xD;
he had been watching for his arrival..&#xD;
"Good'evening, Doctor."&#xD;
"What do you want ?"&#xD;
" How is Miss Huntingdon ?"&#xD;
"What is Miss Huntingdon to you ?"&#xD;
".She was one of my mother's best'friends,&#xD;

truth."    :&#xD;
"She is going to die, I am afraid."&#xD;
A sudden pallor overspread Russell's face,&#xD;
buthe sat erect and motionless, and, fastening&#xD;
his keen eyes upon him, the doctor added:&#xD;
" She's about to be transplanted to a better&#xD;
world,'if there is such a, place. She is too&#xD;
good and pure for this cursed, pestiferous&#xD;
earth.",&#xD;
"Is the case so utterly hopeless ? . I can&#xD;
not, I will not, believe it !" came indistinctly&#xD;
from the young man's Illoodless lips.&#xD;
" I tell you I know better !- She stands on&#xD;
a hair stretched across her 'grave. If I don't&#xD;
succeed to-night .in making her sleep (which&#xD;
I have been trying to accomplyh for two days),&#xD;
she can't possible live. And what is that&#xD;
whole confounded crew of factory savages in&#xD;
"comparison.with her precious life ?"s&#xD;
"Is it true that her illness is attributable to&#xD;
nursing those people ?"&#xD;
" Yes. D-l take the Row ! I wish the&#xD;
river would swallow it up."  .. .&#xD;
"Is she conscious ?"&#xD;
" Heaven only knows; I don't. She lies&#xD;
.with her eyes wide open, looking at every-&#xD;
thing as if she were searching for something&#xD;
which she had lost, but never speaks, and un-&#xD;
derstandsanothing, except to swallow the med-&#xD;
icine when'I put the spoon to'her lips.''&#xD;
."*if I could only see her I" exclajilied Rus-&#xD;
sell, and an expression of such intense agony&#xD;
&#xD;
settled on his features, usually so inflexible,&#xD;
that his companion was startled and astonish-&#xD;
ed. The doctor regarded him a moment with&#xD;
perplexity and compassion mingled in his own&#xD;
'face ; then light  broke upon him, and, rising,&#xD;
he laid his hand heavily on Russell's shoulder.&#xD;
" Of course, Aubrey, you don't visit at that&#xD;
house ?"&#xD;
"Of course not."&#xD;
" Do you meet her often ?"&#xD;
"I have not. seen her- for nearly a year.&#xD;
Not since'the pight in which Hugh Seymour&#xD;
was drowned."&#xD;
He rose, and turned away to screen his&#xD;
countenance from the scrutiny to which, it was&#xD;
subjected, for the painful shock baffled all' his&#xD;
efforts at-self-control and he felt that his fae&#xD;
would betray him.&#xD;
"Where are you going,' Aubrey.?"&#xD;
"Back to my office."&#xD;
".Is there any message which you would like&#xD;
for me to deliver to, her, if she should recover&#xD;
her consciousness ? You may trust me, young&#xD;
man."&#xD;
" Thank you; I have no message to send.&#xD;
I merely called to ask after her. I trust she&#xD;
will yet recover. Good-night."&#xD;
He walked on rapidly till -he' reached the&#xD;
door of his office. The gas was burning brightly&#xD;
over his desk, and red-tape and legal-cap beck-&#xD;
oned him in ; but fathomless blue eyes, calm&#xD;
as mid-ocean, looked up at him, and, without&#xD;
entering, he turned, and w.dnt through the&#xD;
cold and darkness to the cemetery, to his&#xD;
mother's tomb. She had been his comfort in&#xD;
boyish sorrows, and habit was strong; he went&#xD;
to her grave for it still.&#xD;
When Russell left hin Dr. Arnold took&#xD;
from his pocket the only solace he had ever'&#xD;
known-his meerschaum. While he smoked,&#xD;
and mixed some powders in a marble mortar,&#xD;
memory industriously ran back, raking amid&#xD;
the ashes of theoby-gone for here a word and&#xD;
there a look, to eke out the Ariadne thread&#xD;
which his imagination was spinning. The&#xD;
possibility of an attachment -between Irene&#xD;
and the blind widow's son had never occurred&#xD;
to him before ; but that Russell's unmistak-'&#xD;
able emotion could be referable simply to grat-&#xD;
itude to his 'mother's benefactress was an.&#xD;
explanation of which he was disposed to be&#xD;
very sceptical. If this surmise should prove&#xD;
correct, what were Irene's feelings toward the&#xD;
popular young politician? -' Mere he was ab-&#xD;
solutely without data; he could recall nothing&#xD;
to assist him; but, comprehending the bitter&#xD;
animosity existing betwee'tfthe lawyer and&#xD;
her father, he sighed involuntarily, knowing&#xD;
the hopelessness of any such attachment 'on&#xD;
either or both sides. Determined to satisfy&#xD;
himself of thle .truth at the earliestopportuni-&#xD;
ty he carefully weighed out the powder and'&#xD;
rode back to the i1. He-could perceive no&#xD;
change, winless it were a heightening of the&#xD;
carmine on cheeks and lips and 'an increased -&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
twitching of the fingers, which hunted so per-&#xD;
tinaciously about the bedclothes.&#xD;
."That everlasting picking, picking at every-&#xD;
thing, is such an awful bad Â§ign," said poor&#xD;
Nellie, who.was crying bitterly at the feot of&#xD;
the bed--and she covered her, face with her&#xD;
apron to shut out the sight.&#xD;
" You 'pick* yourself off to bed, Nellie ! I&#xD;
don't want you snubbing and groaning around,&#xD;
day and night."g&#xD;
"I am afraid to leave her a minute. I am&#xD;
afraid when my poor baby shuts her eyes she&#xD;
never will open 'em again till she opens 'em in&#xD;
heaven."5&#xD;
"Oh, go along to sleep ! you eternal old&#xD;
stupid.- I will wake you up, I tell you, if she&#xD;
gets worse."&#xD;
He mixed one of the powders and' stooped&#xD;
down.&#xD;
" Irene-Irene, take this for me, won't you,&#xD;
dear ?"&#xD;
She gave no intimation of having heard him&#xD;
till he placed the wineglass to her mouthand&#xD;
raised her head tenderly; then she swallowed&#xD;
the contents mechanically. At the expiration&#xD;
of an hour he repeated the dose, and. at ten&#xD;
o'clock, while he sat watching her intently, he&#xD;
saw the eyelids begin to droop, the long silky&#xD;
lashes quivered and touched her cheeks. When&#xD;
he listened to her breathing, and knew that at&#xD;
last she slept, his gray head sank on his chest&#xD;
and he murmured, inaudibly, " thank God I"&#xD;
Patient as a woman, he kept 'his place at her&#xD;
side, fearing to move lest he should wake her ;&#xD;
the dreary hours of night wore away; morn-&#xD;
ing came, gloriously bright, and still she slept.&#xD;
The flush had faded, leaving her wan as death,&#xD;
'and the little hands were now at rest. She&#xD;
looked like the figures which all have seen on&#xD;
cenotaphs, and anxiously and often the doctor&#xD;
felt the slow pulse, that seemed weary of its&#xD;
mission. He kept the room quiet and main-&#xD;
tained his faithful watch, refusing to leave her&#xD;
for a moment. Twelve o'clock rolled round,&#xD;
and it appeared, indeed,.as if Nellie's prognos-&#xD;
tication would prove true, the sleeper was so&#xD;
motionless. At three o'clock the doctor count-&#xD;
ed the pulse, and, reassured, threw his head&#xD;
back against the velvet lining of the chair and&#xD;
shut his aching eyes.. Before five minutes had&#xD;
elapsed he heard a faint sweet voice say,&#xD;
"Paragon."  Springing to his feet, he saw&#xD;
her put out her hand topat the head of her&#xD;
favorite, who could not be kept out of the&#xD;
room, and howled .sa intolerably when they&#xD;
chained him that they were forced to set him&#xD;
free. Now he stood with his paws on the pil-&#xD;
low and his face close, to hers, whining with&#xD;
delight. Tears of joy almost blinded the doctor&#xD;
as he pushed Paragon aside and said, eagerly:&#xD;
"Irene, one dog is'-as good -as another You&#xD;
know Paragon ; do you know me, Queen ?"&#xD;
" Certainly-I know you, Doctor."&#xD;
" God bless you, Beauty I You have n't,&#xD;
known me for a week."&#xD;

&#xD;
"I am so thirsty-please give me some wa-&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
He lifted her head and she drank eagerly,&#xD;
till he checked-her.&#xD;
" There-=we have n't all turned hydropath-&#xD;
ists since you were taken sick. NellieI I say,&#xD;
Nellie ! you Witch of Endor 'I bring some&#xD;
wine-whey here. Irene, how do you feel,&#xD;
child ?"&#xD;
" Very. tired and. feeble, sir. My head is&#xD;
confused. 'Where is father ?"&#xD;
" Here I am, my daughter."&#xD;
He bent down with trembling lips and&#xD;
kissed her, for the first time since the day of&#xD;
their estrangement, nearly three years before.&#xD;
She put her arms feebly around his neck, and&#xD;
as he held her to his heart she felt a teardrop&#xD;
on her.,forehead.&#xD;
" Father,,have you forgiven me ?"&#xD;
He either could not or would not answer,&#xD;
but kissed her again warmly ; and, as he dis-&#xD;
engaged her arms and left the room, she felt&#xD;
assured that, at last, she had been forgiven.&#xD;
She took the whey silently, and, after some&#xD;
moments, said :&#xD;
" Doctor, have you ,been sitting by me' a&#xD;
long time ?"&#xD;
"I rather think I have !-losing my sleep&#xD;
for nearly ten days you unconscionable young&#xD;
heathen."&#xD;
" Have I been so ill as to require that? I&#xD;
have a dim recollection of going on a long&#xD;
journey, and of'your being by tny side all the&#xD;
way "&#xD;
"Well, I hope you travelled to your entire&#xD;
satisfaction Sand found what  you wanted-for&#xD;
you were feeling about as if hunting for&#xD;
something the whole .time. Oh ! I am -so&#xD;
thankful that you know me once more. Child,&#xD;
you have cost me a deal of sorrow. Now be&#xD;
quiet, and go to sleep again; at least don't&#xD;
talk- to Nellie or Paragon.  I shall take a&#xD;
nap on the sofa in the library."'&#xD;
- She regained her strength very slowly, and&#xD;
many days, elapsed before she was able to&#xD;
leave - her room. One bright sunny morning&#xD;
she sat before the open window, looking down&#xD;
on the.lawn where the pigeons flashed in and&#xD;
out of the hedges, and ntw and then glanc-&#xD;
ing at the bouquet of choice hothouse flowers&#xD;
in the vase beside her. In her lap lay a letter&#xD;
just received from Harvey Young-a letter&#xD;
full of fond remembrance, grave counsel, and&#xD;
gentle encouragement-and, the unbent lines&#xD;
about her mouth showed that her mind was&#xD;
troubled.&#xD;
The doctor came in and drew up a chair.&#xD;
"I should like .to know who gave you leave&#xD;
to ride yesterday ?"&#xD;
"Father thought that I was well enough,&#xD;
and the carriage was close add warm. .I hope,&#xD;
sir, that I shalIl not be on your hands mauch&#xD;
longer."&#xD;
" What did I tell you ? Next time don't be '&#xD;

and wiser persons. I trust you are quite sat&#xD;
asfied with the result of your eleemosynary&#xD;
performances at the Row."      {&#xD;
" Par from it, Doctor. I am fully acclimat&#xD;
ed; now, and have nothing to fear in future&#xD;
I am ;very sorry, sir, that I 'caused you all so(&#xD;
much trouble and anxiety ; I did not believe&#xD;
that I should take the fever. If Philip had&#xD;
not bean so ill I should hav s come out safely;&#xD;
but, I suppose, my uneasiness about him un-&#xD;
nerved me in some way-for, when I saw that&#xD;
he *buld get well, all my strength left me in&#xD;
am instant. How is he, sir&#xD;
"Oh ! the young dog is as well as ever ;&#xD;
limps around now without his crutches. Comes&#xD;
to my office every day to ask after his blessed&#xD;
Lady. Bountiful."&#xD;
Leaning forward carelessly, but so as to&#xD;
command a full view of her face, be added&#xD;
" You stirred up quite an excitement in&#xD;
town, and introduced me generally to society.&#xD;
People, who never inflicted themselves on me&#xD;
before, thought it was incumbent on them to&#xD;
hang around my door to nake inquiries con-&#xD;
cerning my fair patient. One night 1 found&#xD;
even that statue of bronze and steel, Russell&#xD;
Aubrey, waiting at my office to find out wheth-&#xD;
er you really intended translation."&#xD;
A change certainly passed swiftly over&#xD;
her countenance ; but it Was inexplicable, in-&#xD;
describable ; an anomalous lightening of the&#xD;
eye and darkening of the brow. Before he&#xD;
could analyze it , her features resumed their&#xD;
wonted serenity, and he found her voice un-&#xD;
fluttered.&#xD;
" I was not aware that I had so many&#xD;
friends; it is a pleasant discovery, and almost&#xD;
compensates for the painof illness. Take&#xD;
care, Doctor!, You are tilting my flowers out&#xD;
of their vase."&#xD;
" Confound the flowers, Queeni They are&#xD;
always in the way. It is a great pity there is&#xD;
such Theban-brother affection between your&#xD;
father and Aubrey. He has any amount of&#xD;
fine feeling hid away under that dark, Jesuit-&#xD;
ical, non-committal face of his. He has not&#xD;
forgotten your interest in his mother, and&#xD;
wben I told him that I thought you had de-&#xD;
termined to take your departure from this&#xD;
world lie seemed really hurt about it. I al-&#xD;
ways liked the boy, but I think he is a heretic&#xD;
in olitics."&#xD;
Lookig steadily at him as he spoke, she&#xD;
smiled coldly, and answered:&#xD;
"It is very apparent that this fierceness of'&#xD;
party spirit, this bitter political animosity, is&#xD;
driving the ship of State on the rock of Ruin.&#xD;
The foamy lips of the breakers are'just ahead,&#xD;
but you*men will not open your eyes to the&#xD;
danger.'&#xD;
'Be tter get some of you wise women to&#xD;
*pilo&amp;amp; us, I dare say 1" sneered her compa,nion,&#xD;
provoked at -her unsatisfactory manner and&#xD;
alflexible featurese.--&#xD;
" It is not our calling, Doctor; but I promise&#xD;
&#xD;
- you, if the experiment were tried, that you&#xD;
y would find no Palinurus among us. We-ha-ve&#xD;
no desire to thrust ourselves into the forum,&#xD;
- like Roman women 'storming at the Oppian&#xD;
Law and crushing Cato;' still less to imitate&#xD;
3Hortensia and confronting- august Triumvirs&#xD;
in the market-place, harangue against the tax,.&#xD;
I however unjust. Practically, women should&#xD;
have as little to do with politics as men with&#xD;
darning stockings or making puff-paste; but&#xD;
we should be unworthy of the high social status&#xD;
,which  ' our chivalry accords us were we&#xD;
indifferent to the conduct of public affairs.&#xD;
' Man for the-field, andw oman for the hearth :&#xD;
Man for the sword, and for the needle she: .&#xD;
Man with the head, and woman with the heart;&#xD;
Man to command, and woman to obey.'&#xD;
Such is the judicious arrangement of nature-&#xD;
a wise and happy one, indubitably. We bow-&#xD;
before it, and have no wish to trench on your&#xD;
prerogatives; but we do protest against your&#xD;
sleeping on your posts, or lulling yourselves&#xD;
with dreams of selfish -ambition when Scylla&#xD;
and Charybdis grin destruction on either side."&#xD;
".Phew-Queen ! who told you all that?&#xD;
Has Aubrey indoctrinated you in his 'fire-eat-.&#xD;
ing,' schismatic principles ?  What platform&#xD;
do you propose to mount ?"&#xD;
"None, sir, but that of the constitution-r--&#xD;
ignoring both whig and democratic additions,&#xD;
which make it top-heavy.. I don't like latter-&#xD;
day political earpentering. I want to see Nes-&#xD;
tors in the councils of my country, not nerve-&#xD;
less imbeciles, or worthless, desperate political&#xD;
gamesters."        ..,&#xD;
"You rabid little Jacobin !   Don't you&#xD;
think- that, Portia-like, you might completely&#xD;
transmogrify yourself, and get into Conres&#xD;
and Cabinet long enough to write ' Nene,&#xD;
mene' on their walls ?"&#xD;
" They would have no Daniel there, even if&#xD;
I should, which is no business of mine. Dock&#xD;
tor, I claim to be no politician; a thousand&#xD;
years will scarcely produce another pe Stfel.&#xD;
I am simply a true lover of my country-&#xD;
anxious in view of its stormy, troubled future."&#xD;
"Aubrey has not proselyted you, then, after&#xD;
all ?"&#xD;
She had unlocked her writing-desk, and,&#xD;
without seeming to hear his last words, handed&#xD;
him a letter.&#xD;
" Here is a letter from Uncle Eric, which I&#xD;
received yesterday. It contains a message&#xD;
for you about some     medical books  and&#xD;
journals." ' . ,-&#xD;
He muttered something indistinctly, put the'&#xD;
letter in his pocket, and took her hand.&#xD;
" Irene--what is the matter, dear, child ?&#xD;
Your pulse is entirely too quick."&#xD;
" That as nothing :new, Doctor.  Father&#xD;
insists that I shall drink port-wine, and it does&#xD;
not suit me--keeps my head aching continu-&#xD;
ally."&#xD;
" Try porter instead."&#xD;
She shook her head wearily..&#xD;
&#xD;
" I need nothing, sir, but.to be let alone."&#xD;
He smoothed back' her hair and said,&#xD;
hastily :&#xD;
"You will never get what you need. Oh,&#xD;
child!' why won't you trust me ?"&#xD;
" Why-Doctor ! I do."&#xD;
" Hush ! don't tell me that ! I know better.&#xD;
You steel that white face of yours, and-"lock&#xD;
your confidence from the old man who loves&#xD;
you above all other, things."'&#xD;
She drew down his hand from her head and&#xD;
leaned her cold cheek upon it.&#xD;
" You misunderstand me, sir; I repose the&#xD;
most perfect confidence in you. If I were in,&#xD;
trouble, and wanted help or a favor of any&#xD;
,kind, I would apply to you sooner than to any&#xD;
'other human being-for you have always been&#xD;
more patient with my whims than even my&#xD;
own father-and I should 'be worse than an&#xD;
ingrate if I had not the most complete trust in&#xD;
you. My dear, kind friend, what have I done&#xD;
to fret you?"      ,&#xD;
He did not reply, but searched her counte-&#xD;
nance sorrowfully.&#xD;
" doctor, tell me one thing. You nursed&#xD;
me constantly while I. was unconscious, and I&#xD;
want to know whether I said anything during&#xD;
my delirium that surprised Or annoyed you."&#xD;
"No; the trouble was that you sealed your&#xD;
lips hermetically. Are you afraid now that:&#xD;
you divulged some secret which I may betray?"&#xD;
"I am not. afraid of your betraying any-&#xD;
thing-never -bad such 'a thought. When do&#xD;
you think that-I may take a horseback ride&#xD;
with impunity? I. am so tired of the house."&#xD;
"Not for a week, -at least. You must be&#xD;
prudent, Irene, for you are not strong yet, by&#xD;
a great deal."&#xD;
. " I wanted to talk to you, this morning,&#xD;
about something very near my heart ; but you&#xD;
are going."&#xD;
"I can wait, my child. What is it ?"  -&#xD;
." To-morrow will do as well.' I want you&#xD;
to aid me in getting a bill passed by the legis-&#xD;
lature appropriating a school-fund for this&#xD;
county. Perhaps you can obtain Mr. Aubrey's&#xD;
influence with the members of the lower&#xD;
house."   -        -'-&#xD;
" Perhaps I 'll go to, the North Pole to cool&#xD;
a glass of amontillado for your majesty ! I'll&#xD;
be hanged, if I have anything to do with it !&#xD;
Why the deuce can't you ask Mr. Aubrey&#xD;
yourself?"     -      "&#xD;
" Because, in the first place, you know very&#xD;
well that I never see him, and I could not&#xD;
ask 'him, even if I should meet him; and,&#xD;
beside, I do not wish to be known at all in, the&#xD;
affair. It is not a woman's business to put&#xD;
forward legislative bills;"&#xD;
"Indeedl  Then why are you: meddling&#xD;
with other people's business ?" .&#xD;
"Our legislators seeni, to have forgotten one&#xD;
gand and good maxim of Lycurgus: ' Chil-&#xD;
dren are the property of the state, to whom&#xD;
alone their edngatioi 'should obe intrusted.'&#xD;
&#xD;
They have forgotten that our poor require&#xD;
educating, and I simply desire .some oC their&#xD;
constituents to call their attention to the.over-&#xD;

" I will first see myself' floundering like&#xD;
Pharaoh ! I 'll rake out nobody's chestnuts!-&#xD;
Not even yours, child! Put down that, win-&#xD;
dow; the air is too chilly. You are as cold as&#xD;
an iceberg and as blue as a gentian."&#xD;
The doctor had scarcely taken his departure&#xD;
when Nellie's- turbaned heal showed itself at&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
"That factory-boy, Philip, is down stairs ;&#xD;
be brought back a book, and wants to see you.&#xD;
He seems in trouble ; but you don't feel like&#xD;
being bothered to-day, do you?"&#xD;
"Did be ask to see me 2&#xD;
'" Not exactly; but showed very plainly he&#xD;
wanted to see you."&#xD;
"Let him come up."&#xD;
As he entered she rose and held out her&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
" Good-morning, Philip; I am.glad you are&#xD;
well enough to be out again."&#xD;
He looked at her reverently, and, as 'he no-&#xD;
ticed the change her.illness had wrought, his,&#xD;
lips quivered and his eyes filled.&#xD;
"O h,Miss Irene.! I am.so-glad you are bet-&#xD;
ter. I prayed for you all the time while you&#xD;
were so very ill,&#xD;
." Thank you. Sit down and tell.me about&#xD;
the sick."&#xD;
" They are all better, I. believe, ma'm, ex-&#xD;
cept Mrs. Davis. She was wishing yesterday&#xD;
that she could see you again."&#xD;
" I shall go there in a day or two. You are&#xD;
walking pretty well without your crutches.&#xD;
Have you resumed'your work ?"&#xD;
" I shall begin again to-morrow.-&#xD;
"It need not interfere with your -studies.&#xD;

He did not answer immediately, and, observe&#xD;
in" the cloud on his countenance, she added:&#xD;
" Philip, what is the -matter? You. look&#xD;
troubled; .can I do anything for you.?"&#xD;
A deep flush mantled his sallow cheek,, and,&#xD;
drooping his head as if in humiliation, he said,&#xD;
passionately:&#xD;
" ." Oh, Miss Irene ! You are the only friend&#xD;

saw that he trembled violently.h.&#xD;
"'You must struggle against such feeling&#xD;

"No, Miss Irenei they are always holding&#xD;

" That is unjust and ungenerous. No one&#xD;

" Oh, yes, ma'm ! I think so; he is generally&#xD;

looked at her with swimming eyes.&#xD;
"Oh, Miss Irene ! I wish I could'tell you all&#xD;
I feel. I thank you more than I can ever ex-&#xD;
press, and so does mother."&#xD;
"iYou have finished your book, I see ; don't&#xD;
you want another ? Nellie will' show fou.the&#xD;
library, and on the lower book-shelf, on the&#xD;
right,- and 'side of the door, you will find a&#xD;

Tae it with you and read it carefully. Good-&#xD;
by.. I shall come down to the Row to-morrow&#xD;
or next day.&#xD;
As she heard his halting step descend their&#xD;
stairs she leaned back wearily in her chair,&#xD;
and, closing her eyes; these words crept almost&#xD;
inaudibly over her pale lips:&#xD;

Ae            CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
s, " Well, Irene, what is your decision about&#xD;
g the party at Mrs. Churchhill's to-night'?"&#xD;
d.   " I will go with you, Father, if it is a matter&#xD;
ill of so much interest to you; though,'-as I told&#xD;
. you yesterday, 1 should prefer declining the&#xD;
invitation as far as I am concerned." -&#xD;
g    "It is full time for you to go into society&#xD;
y again. You have moped at home long enough."&#xD;
s   ""Moped' is scarcely the right word, Fa-&#xD;
"It matters little what you call it, the fact&#xD;
t, is the same. You have shut yourself in till&#xD;
t, you have grown. to look like a totally different&#xD;
I woman. Indeed, Irene, I won't permit it any&#xD;
r longer ; you must 'come out into the world&#xD;
n once more. I am sick of your black looks;&#xD;
n. let me see you in colors to-night."&#xD;
y    " Will not pure white content you, Father?"&#xD;
"No ; I am tired of' it ; wear something&#xD;
bright."  --&#xD;
e Mr. Huntingdon smoked his after-breakfast&#xD;
cigar, half-reclined on the upper step, and&#xD;
Irene walked up and down the wide colon-&#xD;
nade, enjoying the cool, dewy, fragrant June&#xD;
day, whose sun was rapidly mounting-in heav-&#xD;
en. The air was of that peculiar, stillness&#xD;
found only in southern summer mornings, but&#xD;
. now and then' its holy calm was rippled by the&#xD;
contented ringing whistle of a partridge far&#xD;
down among the grassy orchard~depths, and&#xD;
by the peaceful chime of doves cooin soft and&#xD;
low, one to another, in the thickest saiadors of&#xD;
the dripping grove. True summer sounds-&#xD;
sure concomitants of June. Frail, foam-like&#xD;
cloud-navies in line-of-battle, as if piloted by&#xD;
dubious, treacherous winds, sailed lazily across&#xD;
the sea of intense blue, staring down covet-&#xD;
ously at a ripening field of flashing wheat&#xD;
which bowed and wavered in a long billowy&#xD;
sweep and swell as the mild June breeze stole&#xD;
over it; and on A neighboring hill-side, where&#xD;
sickles had been busy a few days before, the&#xD;
royal yellow shocks stood thick and tall in&#xD;
crowded ranks, like golden gods of Plenty. ,&#xD;
Ahi rareJune day, impearled and purpled,&#xD;
freshly glowing from the robing hands of Dei-&#xD;
ty, serenely regal on her southern throne as&#xD;
Sheba's brown queen.&#xD;
ShIrene, sit here on'the step, where I can&#xD;
see you without twisting my head off of my&#xD;
shoulders. Now, then--what is the matter&#xD;
with you ?"                  '&#xD;
" Nothing unusual, Father."&#xD;
"Don't evade me. Why can't you look and&#xD;
act like other girls,of your age ?"&#xD;
"Probably because I feel differently. But&#xD;
to what do you allude ? In what respect have&#xD;
I displeased you ?.&#xD;
" Oh I in a 'thousand. You never would&#xD;
lokat things in their poer light. Why did&#xD;
you treat William Bainbridge so coldly yester-&#xD;
day evening? You know very well that .he&#xD;
came here expressly to see you." .&#xD;
&#xD;
IU&#xD;
&#xD;
MACARIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
" And) for that reason. sir, I felt it my duty&#xD;
to receive the visit coolly."&#xD;
"You disappointed all my planefor you&#xD;
once ; but let me tell you, if you are not a&#xD;
lownright simpleton, you will accept the offer&#xD;
William Bainbridge came here to make. You&#xD;
are aware of the warm friendship which has&#xD;
always existed between the governor and my-&#xD;
self, and his son is considered the finest match&#xD;
in the state' If you live a thousand years&#xD;
you will never have a better offer, or another&#xD;
as good ; and I do hope, my daughter, that you&#xD;
will not be insane enough to reject him."&#xD;
Father, why are you so anxious to get rid&#xD;
of your ony child ?"&#xD;
"I am not.; but you must marry some time,&#xD;
and I know very well such an opportunity as&#xD;
this will not recur."&#xD;
" Don't youthink, sir, that you and I could&#xD;
live always happily here without planting a&#xD;
stranger at our fireside'? Father, let us un-&#xD;
derstand each other fully. I speak deliberate-&#xD;
ly, and solemnly-I shall never marry.".&#xD;
Mr. Iuntingdon started u' from his indo-&#xD;
lent posture and surveyed his daughter keenly.&#xD;
lHer spotless muslin morning-dress swept&#xD;
down the marble steps, its wide sleeves falling&#xD;
away from the rounded dazzling arms, and a&#xD;
black cord and tassel girding the waist. The&#xD;
geranium-leaves fastened at her throat were&#xD;
unstirred as the silver-dusted lilies sleeping,&#xD;
lotoslike, on some lonely tarn ; and the dewy&#xD;
Lamarque roses twined in her coiled hair&#xD;
glttering and kindled into faint opaline flushes&#xD;
as the sunshine quivered into their creamy&#xD;
hearts. One hand held a steel ring, to which&#xD;
half-a-dozen keys were attached--the other&#xD;
toyed unconsciously with the heavy tassel,&#xD;
and the hushed face, with its deep holy eyes,&#xD;
was lifted to meet her father's.&#xD;
" Nonsense, Irene ! I have heard fifty wom-&#xD;
en say that same thing, and have danced at&#xD;
their weddings six months later."&#xD;
"I do not doubt it. But, Father, no one&#xD;
will ever dance at mine."&#xD;
"And pray why have n't you as good a right&#xD;
to marry and be happy as Qther women '"'&#xD;
.tohe abstract right, and the will to use it,&#xD;
a    heeiffeent, Father; and, as regards happi-&#xD;
areduiful'hom             1to    1el&#xD;
ness, I love my own beautiful"hm, oowl&#xD;
to desire to change it for any other. Let me&#xD;
be quiet here-I ask no more."&#xD;
"b uet, Irene, I cant be expected to live&#xD;
always, even were my society sufficient for&#xD;
you, which is not true."&#xD;
"Death yields allegiance to no decree of&#xD;
mani. I mayfind Hugh in another world&#xD;
before you -are'called to quit this."&#xD;
er father shuddered, and smoked silently&#xD;
for several seconds; then the'crash of whess&#xD;
~nteshelled avenue startled both.&#xD;
*" Here comes Bainbridge now. I promnised&#xD;
higi that you would play a game of billiards&#xD;
wihhim this morning. For heaven's sake,&#xD;
Irene ! be reasonable for once in your life;g let&#xD;
&#xD;
1 5&#xD;
&#xD;
me hear nomore such stuff as you have been&#xD;
talking, but treat the man civilly, and giye&#xD;
him w'Iat he will ask." ,&#xD;
The handsome suitor came up the steps&#xD;
rather dubiously, as if fearful of his welcome;&#xD;
and the heiress rose composedly and, received&#xD;
him with graceful, polished, imperturbable re-&#xD;
serve. A few months before, in compliance.&#xD;
with her father's earnest request, sie had ac-&#xD;
companied him to the capital of the state, and,&#xD;
during this brief visit met aid completely fas-&#xD;
cinated Mr. Bainbridge, whose attentions were&#xD;
susceptible of but one interpretation. He was&#xD;
a year her senior-a chivalric, agreeable, gay&#xD;
young man, who had grown up without select-&#xD;
ing a profession, knowing that his ample fort-:&#xD;
une would more than suffice for his mainte-&#xD;
nance. He was the only son of the governor;&#xD;
his character was unimpeachable, his nature&#xD;
magnanimous, and many of his impulses were&#xD;
truly (noble-but his intellect was far inferior&#xD;
to hers. He could no more comprehend her&#xD;
than .sonie long-inurned Assyrian scroll, for&#xD;
which the cipher-key is wanting; and in the&#xD;
midst of his devotion she was conscious of no&#xD;
feeling save that of utter indifference, some:&#xD;
times waxing into inipatience at his frequent&#xD;
visits. She had studiously avoided encourag-&#xD;
ing' his attentions, but he either could riot or&#xD;
would not interpret her cold reticence.&#xD;
The morning was spent over the billiard-&#xD;
table, and at last, foiled by her skilful-guiding.&#xD;
of the fragmentary conversation, Mr. Bain-&#xD;
bridge having been refused the honor of es-&#xD;
corting her to the party, took his leave, ex-&#xD;
pressing the hope 'that in a few hours he&#xD;
,should see her again...,&#xD;
"Well ?" saidWvr. Huntingdon, seating him-&#xD;
self at the luncheon'-table.&#xD;
" Well, Father; we played till I was heartily&#xD;
tired."&#xD;
",But the result of the visit, Irene ?'&#xD;
" The result was that I beat him 'three games&#xD;
out of five. John, where isthe claret? You&#xD;
have forgotten it-; here are-the keys."&#xD;
" Pshaw ! I mean, did Bainbridge come to&#xD;
the point."&#xD;
i took most of the points from him."&#xD;
" Confound your quibbling ! Did you, ac-&#xD;
cept him ?"&#xD;
"I am happy to be able to tell you, sir, that,&#xD;
he did not afford me an opportuity."&#xD;
" Then I will be sworn it was your' fault-.&#xD;
not his.!"&#xD;
A short silence ensued; Irene sat,,seemingly&#xD;
abstracted, dipping her slender, hand in a&#xD;
rub "-colored Bohemian finger-bowl. Present&#xD;
lv John returned ; she took the bottle from&#xD;
him, and,. filling  her father's glass, said,&#xD;
earnestly :&#xD;
"FEather, I have a favor to ask ato yotur&#xD;
hands ; are you in a mood for concession, ?"y&#xD;
"' That depends-,' as Guy Daril s~ys.&#xD;

I will warrant. You never want what yo&#xD;
ought to have. Speak out, my bleached ge&#xD;
tile Esther !"          -    .&#xD;
"I do ,want another pigeon-box badly, bu&#xD;
that is not to be asked for today. Father&#xD;
will you give me that large beautiful vacant&#xD;
lot, with the old willow-tree, on the corner o&#xD;
Pine street and Huntingdon avenue, opposit&#xD;
the court-house ?"&#xD;
"Upon my word I I must say you are ver&#xD;
modest in your request. What the deue d&#xD;
you want with it?"'&#xD;
"1 know that j am asking a good deal, sir&#xD;
but I ivatit itas a site for an orphan-asylum&#xD;
Will You give it to me ?"&#xD;
"No ! 1 '11 be hanged if I do ! Are yot&#xD;
geing entirely deranged ? What business have&#xD;
you itith asylums, I should like to know&#xD;
Put all of that -ridiculous stuff out of your head&#xD;
Here is something for which I sent to Europe&#xD;
Erie selected it in Paris, and it arrived yes&#xD;
terday. Wear it to-night."&#xD;
He drew a velvet ease from his pocket an&#xD;
laid it before her. . Touehing the spring, th&#xD;
lid 'flew open, and on the blue'satin.lining lay&#xD;
the blazing coils of a magnificent diamond&#xD;
necklace and bracelets.&#xD;
" How, beautiful! how splendidly beautiful !&#xD;
She bent over the flashing mass in silent&#xD;
admiration for some time, examining the deli&#xD;
cate setting, theft looked up at her father.&#xD;
" What did they cost ?"   &#xD;
" Why do you want to know that ?"   Â°&#xD;
"'I am pardonably curious on the subject."&#xD;
" Wll, then, I was silly -enough to give&#xD;
seven thousand dollars for them."&#xD;
"Aiqd what.is the value of that lot I asked&#xD;
for ?"&#xD;
" Five thousand dollars."&#xD;
"Father, these diamonds are the finest I&#xD;
ever saw. They are superbly beautiful; a&#xD;
queen might be proud of them, ani I thank&#xD;
you most earnestly for sn-h a gorgeous present;&#xD;
but, if you will not be offended, I will be can-&#xD;
did with you--I would a thousand times rather&#xD;
have the'lot than the jewels."&#xD;
The expression of blank astonishment with&#xD;
which these words were received would have&#xD;
been ludiero.us but for the ominous thickening&#xD;
of.his brows.'                  *&#xD;
"Father, do not -feel hurt with me, or at-&#xD;
tribute' my conduct to any want of gratitude&#xD;
fbr your indulgent kindness. If' I love the&#xD;
siles of happy children more than the radi-&#xD;
ance of those costly gems,'anI 'would rather&#xD;
wear in my heat the contented faces of well-&#xD;

preference without. oflfeding you? When I&#xD;
-.think of then better use to which this money&#xD;
might -be -a pplied, the incalculable .good it&#xD;
would effect, I shrink from hoarding it upi on&#xD;
thy person to dazzle the eyes of my associates,&#xD;
to incite some -to imitate 'the lavish' expeadi-&#xD;
&#xD;
e, ture, and to awaken in others envious discon.&#xD;
u tent at their inability to cover themselves with.&#xD;
n- similar splendor. The result of such an exam-.&#xD;
pie on our society would be like dropping a&#xD;
it pebble ipto 'some crystal lakelet sleeping in&#xD;
r, evening sunshine; the wavering ring would&#xD;
it widen till the entire glassy surface was shiver-&#xD;
)f ed into spinning circles and dashed on the&#xD;
e rocky shore beyond. Father, forgive me if I&#xD;
have said anything ,disagreeable to you. I&#xD;
y shall be grieved indeed if, on the occasion of'&#xD;
o your too generous indulgence, any disserision&#xD;
arise between us. Tell. me that you are not&#xD;
angry with me."&#xD;
i.   She laid her fingers on his arm, but he&#xD;
shook -off the touch, and, scowling sullenly,&#xD;
i snatched the velvet case from her hand and&#xD;
e stamped out of the room--slamrning the door&#xD;
? so violently that the glasses on the table rang'&#xD;
. out a tinkling -chime and the red wine in the&#xD;
. bottle danced a saraband.&#xD;
-   He went to town, and she met him no more&#xD;
till she was attired for the party. Standing-&#xD;
I before the mirror in her own room she arrang-&#xD;
e ed the flowers in her hair, and, when the leaves&#xD;
were disposed to suit her fastidious taste, she'&#xD;
I took up apearl set which he had given her&#xD;
years before, intending to wear ii. But just&#xD;
then, raising her eyes, she saw her father's&#xD;
t image reflected in the glass. Without turning&#xD;
- she put up her arms, and laying her head back&#xD;
on his shoulder said, eagerly:.&#xD;
" Mrydear, dear Father, do let us be recon-&#xD;
ciled."&#xD;
Clouds and moodiness melted from his hand.&#xD;
some features as-he bent over her an instant,&#xD;
kissing her fondly ; then his hands passed,&#xD;
I swiftly ovmi her neck, an icy shower fell upon&#xD;
it, and she was clothed with light.&#xD;
" My beautiful child, wear your diamonds&#xD;
as a seal of peace. I can't let you have the&#xD;
Pine street lot-I want it for a different'pur-&#xD;
pose; but I will give you three acies on the&#xD;
edge of town, near the depot,-for your asylum&#xD;
whim. It is a better location every way for&#xD;
your project."&#xD;
"Tuauik you, Father. Oh!I thank you, more&#xD;
than ivords can express."&#xD;
She turned her lips to one of the hands still&#xD;
lingering'on her shoulder.&#xD;
"Irene, look at yourself. Diana of Ephesus I&#xD;

MACARIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Harris and Maria' Henderson had been cele-&#xD;
brated with considerable-pomp, andthe party&#xD;
to night was given in honor of the event by'&#xD;
Mrs. Churchhill, a widowed sister of' Jidge&#xD;
Harris. She had spent several years in Paris,&#xD;
superintending the education of a daughter,&#xD;
whom she had recently brought home toreside&#xD;
near her uncle and dazzle all W --with&#xD;
her accomplishments.          .&#xD;
At ten o'clock there stood beneath the gas-&#xD;
lights in 'her elegant parlor a human fleshy&#xD;
antithesis, upon which all eyes were riveted-&#xD;
Salome Churchhill-a dark imperious beauty,&#xD;
of the Cleopatra type; with very full crimson&#xD;
lips, passionate or pouting as occasion demnand-&#xD;
ed; brilliant black eyes that, like August days,&#xD;
burned, dewless and unclouded, a steady blaze;&#xD;
thick shining black hair elaborately curled,&#xD;
and a rich tropical complexion, clear and&#xD;
glowing as the warm blood that pulsed through&#xD;
her rounded graceful form. She wore a fleecy&#xD;
fabric, topaz-colored,' with black lace trim-&#xD;
mings; yellow roses gemmed her hair, and&#xD;
topaz and ruby ornaments clasped her throat&#xD;
and arms. An Eastern queen she looked,&#xD;
exacting universal homage, and full of fiery&#xD;
jealousy whenever her eyes'fell upon one who&#xD;
.stood just opposite. A statuesque face, pure&#xD;
and calm as any ever cut from Pentelie quarry,&#xD;
and cold as its dews-the- delicately-carved&#xD;
features borrowing no color from the glare&#xD;
around her, the polished shoulders and perfect&#xD;
arms gleaming frigidly in the'rainbow-light of&#xD;
her diamonds, and the bronze hair caught up&#xD;
by a pearl comb, with here and there a cluster&#xD;
of clemaiis- bells drooping toward her neck.&#xD;
Irene's dress was an airy blue tulle, flounced&#xD;
to' the waist, and without trimming save the.&#xD;
violet and clematis clusters. Never had her&#xD;
rare beauty been more resplendent-more&#xD;
dazzlingly chilly; it seemed the glitter of an&#xD;
arctic iceberg lit by some low midnight sun,&#xD;
and, turn whither she would, fascinated groups&#xD;
followed her steps. Salome's reputation as a&#xD;
brilliant belle had become extended since&#xD;
Irene's long seclusion, yet to-night, on the re-&#xD;
appearance of the latter, it-was apparent to&#xD;
even the most obtuse that she resumed her&#xD;
sway--the matchless cynosura of, that, social&#xD;
system. Fully conscious of the intense ad.&#xD;
miration- she excited she moved slowly from&#xD;
room to room, smiling.once or twice when she&#xD;
.met her father's proud look of fond triumph&#xD;
fxed upon her.        -&#xD;
Leaning against the window to rest, while&#xD;
Charles Harris went' in search of a glass of&#xD;
water, she heard her name pronounced by&#xD;
tome one on the gallery.'&#xD;
"They say Irene Hluntingdon is positively&#xD;
going to marry Bainbridge. Splendid match&#xD;
both sides. Won't she shine at the governor's&#xD;
.mansion ? I wontder-if siie really grieved much&#xD;
for Seymour? h ow perfectly lovely she is ;&#xD;
and Hluntingdon is so .proud of her. By the&#xD;
way, Neal, have you heard the Iast gossip ? '&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
" About whom ? I have been away a month,&#xD;
-you mnut remember, and am -behind the times.&#xD;
Do tell me."&#xD;
" Well, the very latest report is that, after.&#xD;
all, Aubrey never fancied Grace Haris, as the&#xD;
quidnunes asserted-never addressed her, or&#xD;
anybody else-but is now sure enoughabout&#xD;
to bear off belle Salonie, the now prize, eight&#xD;
in the face of twenty rivals. I should relly&#xD;
like to hear of samethng whicl that man could&#xD;
not do, if he set himself -to work ii earnest. I&#xD;
wonder whether it ever recurs to him that be&#xD;
once stood behind Jacob. Watson's counter ?"&#xD;
"But Aubrey is not here to-night. Does&#xD;
not affect parties, I believe ?"&#xD;
-" Rarely shows himself; but you mistake;&#xD;
he came in not twenty minutes ago, and you&#xD;
should have seen what -Csaw-the rare-ripe red&#xD;
deepen on S'alome's cheeks when he spoke to&#xD;
her."&#xD;
Irene moved away from the window 'and&#xD;
soon after was about to accompany Vharlie-to&#xD;
the hall, when Mr. Bamnbridge came up and&#xD;
claimed her hand for the cotilion forming in&#xD;
the next room. Asrthey took their-places on&#xD;
the floor she saw that. Salome and Russell&#xD;
would be vis-a-vis. With an effort she raised&#xD;
her eyes -to thQse of the mat whoin she had&#xD;
seer last at Hugh's bier; he drooped his head&#xD;
very slightly, she inclined hers;, then the'band&#xD;
smote their instruments, violin and piano, and&#xD;
the crash of music filled the house.&#xD;
Irene loved mechanically through the airy&#xD;
mazes of the dance, giving apparent attention&#xD;
to the low-toned, half-whispered observations&#xD;
of her devoted partner, but straining her ear&#xD;
to catch the mellow voice which uttered such&#xD;
graceful fascinating nothings to Salome. Sev-&#xD;
eral times in the course of the coillon Ru sells&#xD;
hand clasped hers, but even then- hi avoided&#xD;
looking at her, and seemed engrossed in con-&#xD;
versation with his gay partner. " Once Irene&#xD;
looked up steadily, and as she noted the&#xD;
expression with which he regarded hiscorn-&#xD;
pamion she wondered no longer at the rumor&#xD;
She had heard, and' acknowledged to herself&#xD;
that they were, indeed, a handsome coule.&#xD;
Dr. Arnold, whom Mrs. Churchhill had coaxed&#xD;
into "showing himselff" had curiouslywatched&#xD;
this. meeting,'and, observing IRusel's marked&#xD;
attentions, puzzled over the question: Does&#xD;
he really care for that firetly, or is he otdy&#xD;
trying to make Irene jealous"?". lie looked&#xD;
long and earnestly at both, then-sigheeheavi-&#xD;
ly., What did that haughty 'blue-robed woman&#xD;
know of jealousy ' How absurd such a sug'&#xD;
gestion seemed when she turned her smiling&#xD;
passionless face full upon him. The dance&#xD;
ended; Irene found herself seated on a sofa 't&#xD;
the window of the deserted library, and IRe-&#xD;
sell and Salome walked slowly up and dowR&#xD;
the veranda in front of it. Mr. Bainbridge&#xD;
had maumuvred for this opportunity, and, Wa*&#xD;
ed beside Irene, he eagerly 'and eloquenty&#xD;
pleaded in cause,s assuring hr of a dvoi&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC8340-00000065"/>&#xD;
128&#xD;
&#xD;
which should know no diminution, and empha-&#xD;
sizing- the fact that he had possessed himself&#xD;
of her, father's sanction.&#xD;
She made no attempt to interrupt him, but&#xD;
sat erect and motionless, with one hand par-&#xD;
tiallyshielding.her face and the other pressed&#xD;
hard against her heart, where a dull continual&#xD;
pain was gnawing. Every few minutes Russell&#xD;
passed the wiu4ow, his noble head bent down&#xD;
to the beautiful companion on his arm. Irene&#xD;
could see the outline 'of his features distinctly,&#xD;
and her soul sickened as she watched him and&#xD;
reasoned concerning the future. . He would,&#xD;
probably marry somebodyy, and why not. Sa-&#xD;
lopne ?  She could not expect him to remain&#xD;
single always, and he could never be more&#xD;
than' a stranger to her. After his marriage,&#xD;
what a blank her life would be ; to love him&#xD;
still would be sinful. She moved her fingers&#xD;
slightly and looked fixedly at the handsome&#xD;
man beside her, entreatingher to give him the&#xD;
privilege of making her life happy. For an&#xD;
mstant she wavered. The world held nothing&#xD;
for her but dreariness at best ; she was wegry&#xD;
' of alienation and contention; why not accede&#xD;
to: her father's wishes, ,and thus repair the&#xD;
'grievous disappointment of other days?' Wil-&#xD;
liam Bainbridge loved her, and perhaps if she.&#xD;
were his wife the sanctity of her Aws might&#xD;
strengthen her in tearing another image from&#xD;
her heart. She took her future in the palm of&#xD;
her, hand and pondered. At this moment the&#xD;
couple on the veranda paused in frontof the&#xD;
window, to allow the promenading cr6wd to&#xD;
pass, and Russell looked in, with a brilliant&#xD;
smile on his countenance,' It seemed to mock&#xD;
her with a," Marry him. if you dare !" The&#xD;
two passed on into the parlors, and closing her&#xD;
eyes a moment, as if shutting out some hideous&#xD;
vision, Irene' briefly, but firmly and irrevoca-&#xD;
bly, declined the flattering offer; and rising,'&#xD;
left him with his disappointment. She looked&#xD;
about for Dr. Arnold, but he had disappeared ;&#xD;
her father was deep in a game of euch re ; and&#xD;
as she crossed-the.hall she was surprised to see&#xD;
. Philip leaning' against the door-facing and&#xD;
pecrin curiously into the parlors.&#xD;
" Philip, what are you. dong.here ?"&#xD;
" Oh,,Miss Irene l I have been hunting for&#xD;
you ever so long. Mrs. Davis is dying, and&#xD;
Susan sent me afteryou. I went to your&#xD;
house two hours ago, and they said you were&#xD;
here. I ran back and told mother you could&#xD;
not come. But Mrs. Davis worried so, they&#xD;
sent me here. She says she won't die in peace&#xD;
unless she sees you.- She wrung her hands,&#xD;
and asked me if you would not have time&#xD;
enough to go to parties when she was in her&#xD;
grave?  Will you come, ma'm ?"&#xD;
" Of course.,. Philip, find Andrew and the&#xD;
carriage, and I will meet jou at, the side door&#xD;
in five minutes."&#xD;
She went .to the .dressing-room, ,asked for&#xD;
pencil and paper, and wrote a few lines, which&#xD;
she directed the servant to hand immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
4'&#xD;
&#xD;
MACARIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
to her father-found her shawl, and stole down&#xD;
to the side door. -'She saw the dim outline of a&#xD;
form sitting on the step, in the shadow of clus-&#xD;
tering vines, and asked :&#xD;
"Is that you, Philip ?  I am ready."&#xD;
The figure rose, cameforward into the light,&#xD;
hat in hand, and both started visibly.&#xD;
" Pardon me, Mr. Aubrey. I mistook you&#xD;
in the darkness for another.'&#xD;
Here Philip ran up the steps.&#xD;
" Miss Irene, Andrew says he can't get to&#xD;
the side gate for the carriages. He is at the&#xD;
front entrance."&#xD;
" Can I assist you, Miss Huntingdon ?"&#xD;
" Thank you; no."&#xD;
"May I ask if you are ill ?"&#xD;
" 'ot in the least-but I am suddenly called&#xD;
away."&#xD;
She passed him, and accompanied Philip to,&#xD;
the carriage. - A few minutes, rapid driving&#xD;
brought them to the Row, and, directing An-&#xD;
drew to return and wait for her father, Irene&#xD;
entered the low small chamber where a human&#xD;
soul was pluming itself for its final flight home.&#xD;
The dying woman knew her even then in the&#xD;
pierce throes of dissolution, and the sunken&#xD;
eyes beamed as she bent over the pillow.&#xD;
" God bless you! .I knew you would come.&#xD;
My children-what will become of 'them?&#xD;
Will you take care of them?  Tell me quick."&#xD;
" Put your mind at rest, Mrs. Da% is. I&#xD;
will see that your children- are well cared for&#xD;
in every respect."&#xD;
" Promise me !" gasped the poor sufferer,&#xD;
clutching the jewelled arm.&#xD;
" I do promise you most solemnly that I will&#xD;
watch over them 'constantly. They shall&#xD;
never want so long as I live. Will you not&#xD;
believe me, and calm yourself ?"&#xD;
A ghastly smile trembled over the distorted&#xD;
features, and she bowed her head in assent.&#xD;
Irene poured some cordial into a glass and put&#xD;
it to .her lips, but she refused the draught, and,&#xD;
joining her emaciated hands, muttered half-&#xD;
inaudibly :&#xD;
" Pray for me once more.  Oh ! pray for&#xD;
me, my best friend."&#xD;
Kneeling on the bare floor in the midzt of a&#xD;
sobbing group, Irene prayed long and earnest-&#xD;
ly ; and gradually, as her .sweet. voice rolled&#xD;
through the room, a peaceful look settled on&#xD;
the dying mother's face. At last the petition&#xD;
ended and silence reigned, broken only by the&#xD;
smothered sobs of Susan 'and little Johnnie,&#xD;
who clung to Irene's hand and buried his face&#xD;
in her dress as she still knelt at the bedside.&#xD;
"Mrs. Davis, don't you feel that you will&#xD;
soon be at rest with God ?"&#xD;
-" Yes ; I am going home happy-happy."&#xD;
She closed her eyesand whispered:&#xD;
" Sing my-hymn-once-more.".&#xD;
Making a great effort to crush her own&#xD;
feelings, .Irene sang the simple but touching&#xD;
words of " Home Again," and-thdugh her voice&#xD;
faltered now and then, she sang it thirough-&#xD;

He sat down on the step at her feet and&#xD;
raised. hiS 'dark' magnetic face, glowing with&#xD;
the ove which',had so long burned undimmed,&#xD;
his lofty full forehead 'wearing a strange flush.,&#xD;
She d ared not meet his eye, and. drooped&#xD;
her head on her palms, shrinking from the&#xD;
scorch ng furnace of trial, 'whose red jaws&#xD;
yawned to receive her. He waited a moment,&#xD;
and his low, mellow voice' rose to a stormy&#xD;
key. .        i&#xD;
Irene, you are kind and merciful to the&#xD;
poor ;wretches in the Row,  Povertf-nay,&#xD;
crime, does not frighten away yourcompassion&#xD;
for them,; .why are you hard and cruelly.&#xD;
haughty poly to me ?"&#xD;
"4You do not, need my sympathy,' Mr. An-&#xD;

would not come gracefully from my lips. .Most&#xD;
unfortunate obstacles long since rendered all&#xD;
intercours between usimpossible, still my&#xD;
feeling ":for you' has undergone inO change. I&#xD;
am, I assure you, still;your friend.".&#xD;
It eost her a powerful effort to utter these&#xD;
words  and her voice took a metallic tone&#xD;
utterly, foreign to it. Her heart w1'ithed and&#xD;
bled and moaned in the  ripe of her steely&#xD;
purpose but she endured aIl calmly-relaxing&#xD;
not one jot of her bitter resolution.,&#xD;
"My friend! !Mockery ! God defend me&#xD;
from such henceforth. Irene, Ilooked at you&#xD;
to-night in all your wonderful, incomparable&#xD;
loveliness as you hung upon the -arm of your&#xD;
acknowledged lover, and the possibility of your&#xD;
becoming that man's wife absolutely maddened&#xD;
me. I felt that I could never endure that&#xD;
horrible reality, and I resolved to know the&#xD;
truth, Other lips deceive, but yours never&#xD;
can. Tell me, have you promised your hand&#xD;
to Banbridge'? Will you ever, give it to&#xD;
hhn?"&#xD;
"Such questions, Mr. Aubrey, you have no&#xD;
right, to propound."&#xD;
"Right!1 does my worshipping love give me&#xD;

so deeply; and though you scorn to meet me&#xD;

at least, in favor of my love, that it has sur&#xD;

him all! all! if I knew that he had not so&#xD;
successfully hardened, closed your heart against&#xD;

move you,, if one trait of your girlish nature&#xD;
remained. But you are not my, Irene ! The&#xD;
world's queen, t dazzling idol of the ball-&#xD;
room, is not my blue-eyed, angelic Irene of&#xD;
old! I will intrude upow you no longer&#xD;
at least not to despise me for my folly; I will&#xD;
crush it; and if you deign to remember me at&#xD;
all in future, think of a man who laughs at his&#xD;
own idiotcy and strives to forget that he ever&#xD;
believed there lived one woman who would be&#xD;
true to her own heart, even though the heavens&#xD;
aHe rose partially, but her hand fell quickly&#xD;
upon his shoulder and the bowed face lifted&#xD;
itself, stainless as starry jasmines bathed in&#xD;
equatorial dews.&#xD;
"Mr. Aubrey, you are too severe upon&#xD;
yourself and very unjust to me. The circum-&#xD;
stances which conspired tg alienate us were&#xD;
far beyond my control; I regret thenas sin-&#xD;
cerely as you possibly can, but as unavailingly.&#xD;
If I have individually occasioned you sorrow&#xD;
or disappointment, God knows it was no fault&#xD;
of mine. We stand on the opposite shores of&#xD;
a dark, bridgeles gulf; but before we turn&#xD;
away to-be henceforth strangers, I stretch out*&#xD;
my hand to yo rin' friendly farewell-deeply&#xD;
regretting thepain which I may have inno-&#xD;
cently caused you and asking your forgiveness.&#xD;
Mr. Aubrey, rem  aher me as, I was, not as Io&#xD;
am. Good-by, my. friend. May God bless- you&#xD;
in coming years and crown your life with the&#xD;
happiness you merit1 is the earnest, prayer of&#xD;
my heart."                           ho&#xD;
The rare blue cord on her brow told how&#xD;
fiercely the ava-ood surged under its icy&#xD;
bands, ; and the blanched .lip matched her&#xD;
cheek in colorlessness; save these tokens of&#xD;
anguish, no other was visible. d.&#xD;
Russell drew  down the hand from     his&#xD;
shoulder andafolded it in both his own.  p&#xD;
"'Irene,-, are4 we. toy walk different patths&#xD;
henceforth-utter strangers?  Is such your&#xD;
will ?"&#xD;
Such is the necessity which must be .as&#xD;
apparent to you as to me. Do not doubt my&#xD;
friendship, Mr. Aubrey; but doubt the pro-&#xD;
priety of my parading. it before the world."&#xD;
- He, bent his cheek down on her cold hand,&#xD;
then raised it to his lips once, twice--laid it&#xD;
back on her lap, and, taking his hat, walked&#xD;
away, toward town.-,-&#xD;
Two     r blithe .crickets chirped merrily some-&#xD;
where in the brick pavement round,the door,&#xD;
a solitary mocking-bird, perched on the limb&#xD;
of' a neighboring china-tree, warbled his sweet&#xD;
varied -'notes; as ,if in answer,; the mellow&#xD;
,diapason of the Falls rpse'agothingly over all,&#xD;
and the bflue-robed woman sat still as the stone&#xD;
&#xD;
steps of the Factory, watching the vanislhin&#xD;
dyingsparkles of a crystal draughtof j&#xD;
which Fate had rudely dished at her fe&#xD;
sternly denying the parched eager lips.&#xD;
For some time she remained just as Russe&#xD;
had left her, then the  white arms and dr&#xD;
eyes 'were raised to the midnight sky.&#xD;
"dMy io! my God!, strengthen mein m&#xD;
desolation'&#xD;
She put back the folds of hair that, damj&#xD;
with dew, cling toher gleamig temples, an&#xD;
recrossing the wide road or street, entered&#xD;
the chamber of death. Lowispoken word&#xD;
Crept'to and fro between Mrs.Martin and tw&#xD;
-niddle-aged, sad-faced women of the Row&#xD;
who sat around the candle, on the little pin(&#xD;
table, clipping and scalloping a jacoet shroud&#xD;
As Irene approached the scissors rested an&#xD;
"Where i Philip, Mrs. Martin?  I shal&#xD;
ask him to walk home with me, and not wait&#xD;
for the carriage."&#xD;
I expect he is asleep, Miss Irene-but,&#xD;
will wake him.",&#xD;
W"You need not; I' think I hear wheels&#xD;
Yes; they are ,coning, for me. Mrs. Martin&#xD;
I will see you about Susan and Johnnie to-&#xD;

" What a white angel she is !--alnmst as&#xD;
pale is the poor creature on the bed yonder.&#xD;
I catch my breah sometimes when she looks&#xD;
like she did just now."&#xD;
All three sighed simultaneously, and the&#xD;
dull click, click, beg i again.&#xD;
It was no the carriage which Irene met at&#xD;
the' door, but  Dr. Arnold's buggy..&#xD;
" Irene, are you ready to go home ?"&#xD;
"Yes. Mrs. Davis deadd"&#xD;
"As I' was leaving Mrs. Churchbill's ypur&#xD;

watchmen on the tower of Southern Rights-&#xD;
faithful guardians, like William L. Yancey,&#xD;

party strife, pointing to the only path of safe-&#xD;
ty--,now discerned the clou4 upon the lori-&#xD;
zon; andI at the selection 'of' delegates, to the&#xD;
Charleston Convention hedged our cause with&#xD;
cautious resolutions. Among the number ap-&#xD;
pointed was Russell Aubrey; and during' the&#xD;
tempestuous debates which ushered in the war"&#xD;
of 1861 his earnest, eloquent pleadings on the&#xD;
question of a platform rang through his state,.&#xD;
touching the master-chord that thrilled re-&#xD;
sponsive in the great heart of the people.&#xD;
When demagogism triumphed in that convep-&#xD;
tion, and the Democratic party was rent' into&#xD;
hopeless fragments, Russell returned, to stamp&#xD;
the state in favor of the only candidate whom&#xD;
he believed the South could trust with her lib-&#xD;
eries ; and during the arduous campaign that&#xD;
ensued, he gathered fresh laurels and won a&#xD;
brilliant reputation.  Aside from individual&#xD;
ambitious projects, the purest patriotism nerv-&#xD;
ed him to his ceaseless labors. He was deeply&#xD;
impressed with the vital consequences, of the&#xD;
itrpending election ; and as the conviction&#xD;
forced itself upon his mind that, through the&#xD;
demoralization 6f the Northern wing of De-&#xD;
mocracy, Lincoln would be elected, he en-&#xD;
deavored to prepare the masses for that final&#xD;
separation which he foresaw was inevitable.;&#xD;
During that five months campaign faction,&#xD;
'fanaticism, demagogism, held high revel-ran&#xD;
riot through the land. Seward cantered tow-&#xD;
ard Washington on the hobby labelled Eman-&#xD;
cipation, dragging Lincoln at his heels; and&#xD;
Breckinridge, our noble standard-beare, with&#xD;
the constitution ii .his hand, pressed on to save&#xD;
the sacred precincts of the capital from pollu-&#xD;
tion.' The gauntlet had been thrown down by&#xD;
the South at Charleston and Baltimore: "The.&#xD;
election of a' sectional President will be the&#xD;
signal for separation."  The North sneered at&#xD;
the threat,'derided the possibility,'and in fran-&#xD;
tic defiance the die was cast. '- The 6th of&#xD;
Noveniber dawned upon a vast populous em-&#xD;
pire, rich in every resource, capable of the&#xD;
acme of human. greatness and'prosperity,,&#xD;
claiming to be the ardian of peaceful liberty.&#xD;
t set upon a naati'dirent in 'twain, between&#xD;
whose sections yawned bottomless, bridgeless&#xD;
gulf, where the;shining pillars of the temple'&#xD;
of Concord had stood for eighty years; 'an'a'&#xD;
rating sound of horror shuddered throughthe&#xD;
and as 'the 'brazen, bloodeclotted' doors, of&#xD;
Janus- flung themselves suddenly wide a part.&#xD;
Linicoln was elected. ' Abolitionism, so Son&#xD;
adroitly cloaked, was triumphantly' clad n&#xD;
robes of states-shamneless anw and 'hideogms;&#xD;
and while the ~thlooked upon the loathsome&#xD;
&#xD;
A ,;&#xD;
&#xD;
face of its political Mokanna, the South pre-&#xD;
pared for resistance.&#xD;
No sureri ndiation of the purpose of the,&#xD;
Southern people could have been furnished&#xD;
than the- temper in which the 'news was re-&#xD;
ceivel. No noisy outbursts, expendingresotve&#xD;
in einpty words--no surface excitement--ent&#xD;
a stern calm gloom, set lips, heavy bent brows,&#xD;
appropriate in men who realized that they had&#xD;
A revolution on their hands.; not indignation-&#xD;
meetings, with fruitless rps&amp;amp;lutions-that they&#xD;
stood asbody-guard for the liberty of the Re-&#xD;
public, 'and would preserve, the trust 'at all&#xD;
hazards. It would seem that, for a time at&#xD;
least, party animosities would have been crush-&#xD;
ed ; but, like the Eumenides of Orestes, they&#xD;
merely slept for a moment, starting up wolfish&#xD;
and ,hnplacable as ever; and, even here in&#xD;
many instances, the old acrimony of feeling&#xD;
showed itself. Bitter differences sprung up at'&#xD;
the very threshold on 'he modus operand of&#xD;
Southern release from Yankee-1gyptic bond-&#xD;
age. Separate "state action" ,or" co-opera-&#xD;
tion" divided the people, many of whom were&#xD;
earnestly impressed by the necessity and ex-&#xD;
pediency of deliberate, concerted, simultane-&#xD;
ous action on the part of alf the Southern&#xD;
states, whileothers vehemently advocatedthis&#xD;
latter course -solely because the former ,plan&#xD;
was advanced and supported by their old op-&#xD;
ponents. In this new issue, as if fate persist-&#xD;
ently fanned the flame of- hate between 1ir.&#xD;
Huntingdon and Russell Aubrey, they ware&#xD;
again opposed as candidates for the State Con-&#xD;
vention. Ah! will the, ghost of action ever&#xD;
be laid in this' our republican land? Shall&#xD;
this' insatiate immemorial olitical Fenris, 'for&#xD;
ever prey upon the people .&#xD;
W --- was once more convulsed,, and&#xD;
strenuous efforts were made by both sides,&#xD;
Russell was indefatigable in his labors for&#xD;
prompt, immediate state' action, proclaiming&#xD;
his belief that co-operationwas impracticable&#xD;
before/seoession ; arid it was now that 'his reo-&#xD;
searches in' the dusty regions of statistics came&#xD;
admirably into play, as he. built up his ar u-&#xD;
ments on solid foundations of indisputable ci&#xD;
culation.P&#xD;
For the first time in her life Irene 'openly&#xD;
confronted her father's wrath on political,&#xD;

"'What ! with nobody but the servants ?'&#xD;
" They will take better care of 'me than&#xD;

At the close of a week a telegraphic'des-&#xD;

of his appointment as major in the provisional&#xD;

gling thi ugh the window, he saw rene glide&#xD;

" Why don't you go to sleep, Irene ?"&#xD;

"I never knew you to- be nervousibefore; I&#xD;

She put her arm about his neck, drawing&#xD;
his face close to hers, and' he felt, her lips&#xD;

" So'I do, Father.' I think that every man&#xD;
in the Confederacy who can leave 'his family&#xD;

duty does not prevent people from suffering&#xD;

Davus sum non CEdipus. In 1781, when com-&#xD;
pelled to raise the Siege of Ninety-Six, it&#xD;
became very important that General Greene&#xD;
should communicate with Sumter. The inter-&#xD;
vening country was, however, so filled with&#xD;
British and Tories, and such dangers attended&#xD;
the mission, that no one could be found willing&#xD;
to undertake it. In this emergency, when&#xD;
.even our patriots of the first Revolution shrank&#xD;
back,: Emily Geiger, only eighteen years of&#xD;
age, volunteered to make the hazardous at-&#xD;
tempt, and received from General Greene a&#xD;
letter and verbal' messages which he was ex-&#xD;
tremely desirous should reach their destination.&#xD;
Mounting 'a swift horse, she performed a por-&#xD;
tion of the journey in safety ; but was ulti-&#xD;
mately arrested by two Tories, who suspected&#xD;
that she might be rendering important,.though&#xD;
clandestine, service to " the rebels." Swiftly&#xD;
and unobserved she swallowed the written&#xD;
,despatch, and, baffled in their expectation off&#xD;
finding suspicious documents, they allowed her&#xD;
to proceed. Sumter'scamp was safely reached,&#xD;
the messages were delivered, General Greene's&#xD;
army was reinforced, and soon became'strong&#xD;
'enough to assume the offensive. Rawdo:n was&#xD;
forced to retreat, and' Greene subsequently&#xD;
met and vanquished the British army at Eutaw&#xD;
Springs. Was not Emily Geiger's slender&#xD;
womanly hand instrumental in preparing for&#xD;
that battle, the results of which freed the&#xD;
Carolinas ?       - -  I&#xD;
In July, 1861, when the North, blinded by&#xD;
avarice and hate, rang with the;cry of "On to&#xD;
Richmond," our Confederate Army of the&#xD;
Potomac was divided between Manassas and&#xD;
Winchester, watching at both points the glit-&#xD;
tering coils of the Union boa-constrictor, which&#xD;
writhed in its efforts to crush the last sanctuary&#xD;
of freedom. The stringency evinced along&#xD;
the Federal lines prevented the transmission&#xD;
of despatches by the Secessionists of Mary-&#xD;
land, and for a time Generals Beauregard and&#xD;
Johnston were kept in ignorance of the move-&#xD;
ments: of the enemy. Patterson hung dark&#xD;
and lowering around Winchester, threatening&#xD;
daily descent; while the main column of the&#xD;
grand army under McDowell proceeded from&#xD;
Washington, confident in the .expectation of&#xD;
overwhelming the small army stationed at&#xD;
Manassas. The friends of liberty who were&#xD;
compelled to remain in the desecrated old&#xD;
capital appreciated the urgent necessity of ac-&#xD;
quainting .General Beauregard with the de-&#xD;
signs of McDowell and the arch-apostate,&#xD;
Scott ; but all channels of egress seemed seal-&#xD;
ed ; all roads leading across the Potomac were&#xD;
vigilantly guarded, to keep the great secret&#xD;
safely 5 and painful apprehensions 'were in-&#xD;
dulgeds for the fate of these Confederate army.&#xD;
But the Promethean spark of patriotic devo-&#xD;
tion 'burned irt'the hearts of Secession women;&#xD;
&#xD;
and, resolved to dare all things in h cause' so&#xD;
holy, ayoung lady of Washington, strong in'&#xD;
heroic faith, offered to encounter any perils,&#xD;
and pledged her life to give Gen. Beauregard&#xD;
the necessary information. -Carefully conceal-&#xD;
ing a letter in the twist of her luxuriant hair,&#xD;
which would escape detection even should she&#xD;
be searched, she disguised herself effectually,&#xD;
and, under the mask of a market-woman, drove&#xD;
a cart through Washington, across the Po-&#xD;
tomac, and deceived the guard by selling vege-&#xD;
tables and milk as she proceeded. Once beyond&#xD;
Federal lines, and in friendly neighborhood, it&#xD;
was but a few minutes work to "off ye lend-&#xD;
ings" and secure a horse and riding-habit.&#xD;
With' a courage and rapidity which must ever&#xD;
command the admiration of a brave people,&#xD;
she rode at hard gallop that burning July-after-&#xD;
noon to Fairfax Court-house, and telegraphed&#xD;
to Gen. Beauregard, then at Manassas Junc-&#xD;
tion, the intelligence she had risked so much to&#xD;
convey. Availing himself promptly of the facts,&#xD;
he flashed them along electric wires to Rich-&#xD;
mond and to General Johnston ; and thus,&#xD;
through womanly devotion, a timely junction&#xD;
of the two armies was effected ere McDowell's&#xD;
banners flouted the skies of Bull Run.&#xD;
Carthagenian women gave their black-locks&#xD;
to string their country's bows and furnish cord-&#xD;
age for its shipping; and the glossy tresses of&#xD;
an American woman veiled a few mystic&#xD;
ciphers more potent in GeneralBeauregard's&#xD;
hands than Talmudish Shemhamphorash.&#xD;
Her, mission accomplished, the dauntless&#xD;
courier turned her horse's head and, doubtless,&#xD;
with an exulting, thankful heart returned in&#xD;
triumph to Washington. When our national&#xD;
jewels are made up, will not a ,grateful and&#xD;
admiring country set her name between those&#xD;

could not pause to recognize ; and with:th&#xD;
golden 'glow of summer sunshine came th&#xD;
tramp of infantry, the, clatter of cavalry, th&#xD;
sullen growl of artillery. Major .'Huntingdoi&#xD;
had been temporarily assigned to a regimen&#xD;
of infantry after leaving Richmond, and wa&#xD;
posted on ,the right of General Beauregard'&#xD;
lines, commanding one of the lower fords&#xD;
Two miles higher up the stream, in a differen&#xD;
brigade, Colonel Aubrey's regiment guarde&#xD;
another of the numerous crossings. As th&#xD;
day advanced, and the continual roar of can&#xD;
non' toward Stone Bridge' and Sudley's For&#xD;
indicated that the demonstrations on McLean's&#xD;
Blackford's,. and Mitchell's fords were -mere&#xD;
feints to hold our right and centre, the trut i&#xD;
flashed on General Beauregard that the main&#xD;
column was hurled against Evans' little band&#xD;
on the extreme 'left. Hour 'after hour passed&#xD;
and the thunder deepened on the Warrenton&#xD;
road ; then the general learned, with uiutter-&#xD;
able chagrin, that his order for an advance on&#xD;
'Centreville had miscarried, that a brilliant&#xD;
plan had been frustrated, and that: new com-&#xD;
binations and dispositions must now be resort-&#xD;
ed to.: The regiment to which Major- Hunt-&#xD;
ingdon was attached was ordered to the sup-&#xD;
port of the left wing, and reached the distant&#xD;
position in an almost incredibly' short time,&#xD;
while two regiments of the 'brigade to which&#xD;
Colonel Aubrey belonged were sent forward&#xD;
to the same point as a reserve.&#xD;
Like incarnations of Victory, beauregard&#xD;
and, Johnston swept to the front, where the&#xD;
conflict was most deadly; everywhere, at sight&#xD;
of them, our thin ranks dashed forward, and&#xD;
were mowed down by the fire of Rickett's and&#xD;
Griffin's batteries, which crowned the position&#xD;
they were so eager to regain. - At half-past&#xD;
two o'clock the awfulcontest.was at its height.;&#xD;
the rattle of musketry, the ceaseless whistle of&#xD;
rifle-balls, the deafening boomiof artillery, the&#xD;
hurtling hail of' shot,, and explosion of shell,&#xD;
dense volumes of smoke shrouding the com&#xD;
batants, and clouds of dust boiling up on; all&#xD;
sides, lent unutterable horror to a scene which,&#xD;
to cold, dispassionate observers, might have&#xD;
seemed sublime. As the vastly superior num-&#xD;
hers of the Federals forced ourstubbo'rn bands&#xD;
to. give back slowly, an order came from Gen-&#xD;

foe and forced them temporarily back. Major&#xD;
IHuntingdon's horse was shpt .under him; he&#xD;
disengaged himself:and marched on foot, wav-&#xD;
ing hIs sword and uttering words of encour-&#xD;
a eme t. He,'had proceeded-but a few yards&#xD;
ea giape-shot entered his side, tearing its&#xD;
way' through his body, and he fell where the&#xD;
dead lay 'hekest.y Fox' a time the enemy re-&#xD;
tired,'but heavy reinforcements pressed in and&#xD;
they returned, 'reoceu ying the old ground.&#xD;
Not.. moment was to be lost ; General Beaureg&#xD;
&#xD;
e gard ordered forward his reserves for a second&#xD;
e effort, and, with magnificent effect, led the&#xD;
e charge in person. Then Russell Aubrey first&#xD;
n came actively upon the field. :At the word of&#xD;
t, command -he-dashed forward with his splendid&#xD;
s 'regiment, and, high above all, towered his&#xD;
s powerful form, with the long' black plume of'&#xD;
. his hat drifting upon the wind as he led his&#xD;
t admiring men.&#xD;
d    As he pressed on, with thin nostril dilated&#xD;
e and. eyes that burned like those of a tiger seiz-&#xD;
- mg his prey, he'saw, just in his path, leaning&#xD;
d on his-elbow, covered with blood and smeared&#xD;
'with dust, the crushed, writhing form of his&#xD;
bitterest enemy. His horse's hoofs were al-&#xD;
most upon him; he reined him 'back an in-&#xD;
stant and glared down at his old foe. It was&#xD;
I only for an instant; and as Major Huntingdon&#xD;
, looked on. the stalwart figure -and at the ad-&#xD;
vancing regiment, life-long hatred and jeal-&#xD;
ousy were 'forgotten--patriotism throttled all&#xD;
the past in her grasp-he feebly threw up his&#xD;
hand, cheered faintly, and, with his eyes on&#xD;
Russell's;, smiled grimly, saying with evident&#xD;
difficulty:.&#xD;
"Beat them back, Aubrey ! Give them the&#xD;
bayonet !"&#xD;
The shock-was awful-beggaring language.&#xD;
On,' on they swept, while ceaseless cheers&#xD;
mingled with 'the cannonade ; the ground was&#xD;
recovered, to be captured no more. The Fed-&#xD;
erals were driven. back across the turnpike,&#xD;
and now dark masses of reinforcements de-&#xD;
bouched on, the plain and, marched'toward our&#xD;
left. -Was it Grouchy or Blucher?  Some&#xD;
,moments: of painful: suspense ensued, while&#xD;
General, Beauregard strained his eyes to de-&#xD;
eipher the advancing banner. - Red and white&#xD;
and :blue, certainly ; but was it the ensign of&#xD;
Despotism or of Liberty? Nearer andnearer&#xD;
came the: rushing column; and lo! upon the&#xD;
breeze streamed, triumphant as the Labarum&#xD;
'of Constantine, the'Stars and Bars.. Kirby&#xD;
Smith and Eliey-'-God be praised !, The day&#xD;
was won, and Victory nestled proudly among&#xD;
the folds of our new-born banner. One more&#xD;
charge along our whole 'line, and the hireling&#xD;
hordes of oppression fled, panic-stricken. Rus-&#xD;
sell had received a painful wound from a&#xD;
minie ball, which entered his shoulder and&#xD;
ranged-down toward the elbow, but. he main-&#xD;
tamed his position, and led his regiment a mile&#xD;
in the pursuit.. When it became evident that&#xD;
the retreat was a .complete rout, he resigned&#xD;
the command to Lieutenant-Colonel Black-&#xD;
well and rode back to the- battle-field. Hide-&#xD;
ous was the' spectaclepresented-dead and&#xD;
dying, friend and foe,.huddled in indiscrimi-&#xD;
nate ruinweltering inblood and shiveringtin&#xD;
the agonies of dissolution; blackened headless&#xD;
trunks and fragments of limbs-ghastly sights&#xD;
and sounds 'of woe, filling the scene ofeom at-.&#xD;
Such were the first 'fruits of the bigotry and&#xD;
fanaticallhate of New England, aided by the&#xD;
unprincipled -demagogisnm ofthe West; such&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
were the wages of Abolitionism, guided by&#xD;
Lincoln and Seward-the latter-day Sejanus;&#xD;
such the results of "higher-law," canting, pu.&#xD;
ritanical hypocrisy.1&#xD;
Picking his way to avoid, trampling the&#xD;
dead, Russell saw Major Huntingdon at a&#xD;
littledistance,:trying to drag= himself toward a&#xD;
neighboring tree. The memory of his injuries&#xD;
crowded up-the memory of all that he had&#xD;
endured and lost through that man's preju-&#xD;
dice-the sorrow that might have been averted&#xD;
from his blind mother-and his vindictive&#xD;
spirit rebelled at the thought of rendering him&#xD;
aid. But as he paused, nd struggled against&#xD;
his better nature', Irene' holy face,-as he saw&#xD;
it last, lifted in prayer for him, rose, angel-like,&#xD;
above all that mass of death and horrors.&#xD;
The sufferer was Irene's father ; she was&#xD;
hundreds of miles away ; Russell set his lips&#xD;
firmly, and, riding up to the prostrate figure,&#xD;
dismounted. Exhausted by his efforts, Major&#xD;
Huntingdon had fallen, back in the- dust, and&#xD;
an expression of intolerable agony distorted&#xD;
his features as Russell stooped over him' and&#xD;
asked, in a voice meant to be gentle:&#xD;
"Can I do anything for you?  Could you&#xD;
sit up if I placed you on my horse ?"&#xD;
The wounded man scowled as he recognized&#xD;
the voice and face, and turned his head par-&#xD;
tially away, muttering :&#xD;
"What brought you here ?"&#xD;
"There has never been any love between&#xD;
us, Major Huntingdon.; but we are fighting in&#xD;
the same-cause for the first time in our lives.,&#xD;
You are badly wounded, and, as a. fellow-&#xD;
soldier, I should be glad to relieveyour suffer-&#xD;
ings if possible. Once more, for humanity's&#xD;
sake, I ask, 'can you ride my horse to the rear&#xD;
if I 'assist you to mount ?"-&#xD;
"No. But for God's sake give me some&#xD;
water !"'&#xD;
Russell knelt, raised the head, and unbuck-&#xD;
ling his, canteen, put it to his lips,'using his&#xD;
own wounded arm with some difficulty. Half&#xD;
of the contents was eagerly swallowed, and&#xD;
the remainder Russell poured=slowly on the&#xD;
gaping ghastly wound in his side. The proud&#xD;
man eyed him steadily till the last cool drop&#xD;
was exhausted, andsaid sullenly: -&#xD;
" Youowe me no kindness, Aubrey. I hate'&#xD;
you, and you know it. But you have heaped&#xD;
coals of fire on my head. You are more gen-&#xD;
erous than I thought you. Thank you, Au-&#xD;
brey ; lay me under that tree yonder and let&#xD;
me die."&#xD;
" I will try to find a surgeon. -Who belongs&#xD;
to your regiment ?"&#xD;
"ISomebody --whom-' I never saw till last&#xD;
week. I won't have hin hacking about me.&#xD;
Leave me in peace."&#xD;
'a Do.you know anything of your servant ?&#xD;
I saw him as I came on the field."&#xD;
" Poor Williain i he followed me so closely&#xD;
that he was shot through .the head. He is&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
lying three hundred yards to the left,; yonder.&#xD;
Poor fellow ! he was faithful to the last."&#xD;
A tear dimmed the master's eagle, eye as he&#xD;
muttered, rather than 'spoke, these words.&#xD;
" Then I will find Dr. Arnold at once, and&#xD;
send him to you."&#xD;
It was noeasy matter, on that crowded, con-&#xD;
fused Aceldama, and the afternoon ,was well.&#xD;
nigh spent before Russell, faint and weary,&#xD;
descried. Dr Arnold busily using his instru-&#xD;
ments in a group -of wounded. hie rode up,&#xD;
and, having procured drink of)water' and&#xD;
refilled his canteen, approached the surgeon.&#xD;
" Doctor, where is' your horse? I want&#xD;
you ?'~&#xD;
'" Ho, Cyrus!bring him up. What is the.&#xD;
matter, Aubrey?  You are hurt."&#xD;
"Nothing serious, I think. , But Major,&#xD;
Huntingdon 'is 'desperately wounded-mor-&#xD;
tally, I am afraid. See what you can do for&#xD;
him."&#xD;
" You must be mistaken! I have asked re-&#xD;
peatedly for Leonard, and they told me he&#xD;
was in hot pursuit and unhurt. I hope to&#xD;
heaven you are mistaken !"&#xD;
"-Impossible ; I tell you I lifted him out of a&#xD;
pool of his own blood. Come ; I will show you&#xD;
the way."&#xD;
- At a hard gallop they crossed the interven-&#xD;
ing woods, and without- difficulty Russell&#xD;
found the spot where thq mangled form. lay&#xD;
still. He had swooned, with his face turned&#xD;
up to the sky, and the ghastliness of death&#xD;
had settled. on his strongly-marked, handsome&#xD;
features.&#xD;
" God pity Irene !" said the doctor, as he&#xD;
bent down and-examined the horrid wound,&#xD;
striving to press the red' lips together.&#xD;
,The pain caused;'from handling him roused&#xD;
the brave spirit to consciousness, and, opening&#xD;
his eyes, he looked around wonderingly.&#xD;
"Well, Hiram ! it is allover with me, old&#xD;
fellow."&#xD;
"I hope not, Leonard ; can't you turn a lit=&#xD;
tIe, and let me feel for the ball ?"&#xD;
"It is of no use ; I am torn all ,to pieces.&#xD;
Take me out of this dirt, on the, fresh grass&#xD;
somewhere."&#xD;
" I must first extract the ball..' Aubrey, can&#xD;
you help me raise him a little ?"&#xD;
Administering some chloroform, he, soon&#xD;
succeeded in taking out the ball, and, with&#xD;
Russell's assistance, passed a ban age--round&#xD;
the body.&#xD;
" There is no chance for me, Hiram; I&#xD;
know that., I have'few.minutes to live. Sonie&#xD;
water."&#xD;
Russell put a cup to his white lips, and,-call-&#xD;
ing in the assistance of Cyrus, who had. fol-&#xD;
lowed his master, they carried him several&#xD;
yards farther, and made him comfortable, while&#xD;
orders were despatched for an ambulance.&#xD;
" It will come after my corpse.. i Hiram, see&#xD;

thanked God for his. deliverance. With a&#xD;
countenance pale from physical suffering, but&#xD;
bearping with triumphant joy for the Nation's&#xD;

and dying, striving.to relieve the wounded and&#xD;
.to find the members of his own . command.&#xD;
Passing from group to group, he heard a feeble,&#xD;
fluttering voice Pronounce his name, and saw&#xD;
one of his men sitting against a tree, mortally&#xD;
wounded by a fragment of shell.&#xD;
",Well, Colonel;I followed that black feather&#xD;
of yours as long as I could. I am, glad I had&#xD;
one good chance- at the cowardly villains&#xD;
before I got hurt.  We've thrashed them&#xD;
awfully, and I am willing to die now.",&#xD;
" I, hope you are not so badly hurt. Cheer&#xD;
up, Martin; I will bring a, doctor to dress&#xD;
your leg, and we will soon have you on&#xD;
crutches."&#xD;
"No, Colonel; the doctor has seen it, and&#xD;
says there is nothing to be done for me. I&#xD;
knew it before ; everybody feels when death&#xD;
strikes them. Dr. Arnold gave me something&#xD;
that has eased me of my pain, but -he can't&#xD;
save me. Colonel, they say my captain is&#xD;
killed ; and, as I may not see any of our com-&#xD;
pany boys, I wish you would write to my poor&#xD;
wife,, and tell her all about it. I have n't&#xD;
treated her as'well as I ought ; but a wife for-&#xD;
gives everything, and she will grieve for me,&#xD;
though I didact like a brute when I was drink-&#xD;
ing. She will be proud to know that I fought&#xD;
well for my country, and dieda faithful Con-&#xD;
federate soldier; and. so will my boy, my&#xD;
Philip, who wanted to come with me. Tell&#xD;
Margaret to send him to take my place just as&#xD;
soon as he is old enough. The boy will ,re-&#xD;
venge me ; he has a noble spirit.' And,,&#xD;
Colonel, be sure to tell her to tell Miss Irene&#xD;
that I kept my promise to her-that I have not&#xD;
touched a drop of liquor since the day she&#xD;
talked to me before I went out to build Mr.&#xD;
Huptingdon's gin-house. God bless her sweet,&#xD;
pure soul I I believe she saved me from a&#xD;
drunkard's grave, to fill that of a brave&#xD;
soldier. I know she will -never let my Mar-&#xD;
garet suffer, as long as she lives."&#xD;
"Is there anything else I can do for you,&#xD;
Martin ?"&#xD;
"Nothing else, unless I could get a blanket,&#xD;
or something, to put under my-head. I am&#xD;
getting very weak."&#xD;
"Leavens, pick: up one of those knapsacks&#xD;
scattered about, and bring a blanket. I prom-&#xD;
ise you, Martin, I will write to your wife ; and&#xD;
when I go home, if I outlive this war, I will see&#xD;
that she is taken care of. I am sorry to lose&#xD;
you, my brave fellow. You were one of the&#xD;
best sergeants in the regiment. But remem-&#xD;
ber that, you h   ave helped to win 'a great&#xD;
battle, and your country will not forget her&#xD;
faithful sons who fell at Matnassas."&#xD;
" Good-by, Colonel; I sboul like to follow&#xD;
you to. Washington. You have been kind'-to&#xD;
us all, and I hope you wills be spared to ou~r&#xD;
&#xD;
MACARIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
regiment. God bless you, Colonel Aubreyj&#xD;
wherever you go."&#xD;
Russell changed him from his constrained&#xD;
posture to a more comfortable one, rested his&#xD;
head on a. knapsack and blanket, placed his&#xD;
own canteen beside him, and, with a long, hard&#xD;
gripe of hands, and faltering ",Godlbess you!"*&#xD;
the soldiers parted. The day of, horrors was&#xD;
shuddering to its close,; glazing eyes were&#xD;
turned for the last time to the sun which set in&#xD;
the fiery west,; the din and roar of the pursuit&#xD;
died away in the distance loweringno clouds&#xD;
draped the sky; the groans and wails of the&#xD;
wounded rose mournfully on the reeking air;&#xD;
and night and a drizzling rain eame down on&#xD;
the blanched corpses on the, torn, trampled,&#xD;
crimson plain of Manassas.&#xD;
"I hate the dreadful holov behind -the little wood.&#xD;
Its lips in the field above are dabbled with blood-red heath,&#xD;
The red-ribbed ledges drip with a silent horror.of blood,&#xD;
And Echo there, whatever is asked her, answers 'Death!"&#xD;
But all of'intolerable torture centred not there,&#xD;
awful as was the scene. Throughout the&#xD;
length and breadth of the Confederacy tele-&#xD;
graphic, despatches told that the battle was&#xD;
raging; and an army of women spent that lst&#xD;
upon their knees, in agonizing prayer 'for&#xD;
husbands and sons who wrestled for their&#xD;
birthright on the far-off field of blood. Gray-&#xD;
haired 'pastors and curly-headed children alike&#xD;
besought the God of Justice toblessthe Right,,&#xD;
to deliver our gallant. band-of patriots from&#xD;
the insolent hordes sent to destroy us; and to&#xD;
,that vast trembling volume of prayer which&#xD;
ascended from early morning from the altars of&#xD;
the South God lent his ear, and answered,&#xD;
The people of W----- were subjected to&#xD;
painful suspense as hour after hour crept by,&#xD;
and a dense crowd collected in front of the&#xD;
telegraph-office, whence floated an ominous&#xD;
red flag. Andrew waited on horseback to&#xD;
carry to Irene the latest intelligence, and&#xD;
during. the entire afternoon she paced the&#xD;
colonnade, with her eyes fixed on the winding&#xD;
road. At- half-past five o'clock the solemn&#xD;
stillness of the sultry day was suddenly broken&#xD;
by a wild, prolonged shout from 'the town ;&#xD;
cheer after cheer was caught up by the hills,&#xD;
echoed among the purple valleys, and finally&#xD;
lost in the roar of the river. Andrew galloped&#xD;
up the avenue with an ettr , yet damp from&#xD;
the printing-press, containing the joyful tidings&#xD;
that McDowell's army. had been completely&#xD;
routed, and was being pursued toward Alex-&#xD;
andria, , Meagre was the account-our heroes,&#xD;
Bee and Bartow, had fallen. No other details.&#xD;
were given, but the premonition', "Heavy loss&#xD;
on our side," sent a thrill of horror to every'&#xD;
womanly heart, dreading to lesrn the price of&#xD;
victory. Irene's white. face flushed as ' she&#xD;
read the despatch, and, raising her 'hands, ex-.&#xD;
claimed:&#xD;
" Oh, thank God I thank God !"&#xD;
" Shall I go. back to .the office ?"&#xD;
" Yes; I shall certainly get a despatch from&#xD;

" But, Captain, if, with all these .facts star-&#xD;

and beg you-to allow me to undergo the hard-&#xD;
ships incident to the trip in preference to un-&#xD;

sooner run -afoul. of a Federal frigate than see.&#xD;
you suffer for want of anything. I can't even&#xD;

"But I suppose, sir, we could contrive to&#xD;
live a few days without eating at a regular&#xD;

your mind. Do waive your scruples, and con-&#xD;

"I add my prayers to hers.'- Wright, do,&#xD;
take us. We shall not mind -privations or'in-&#xD;

" Well, then,. understand distinctly that,'if&#xD;
anything happens, you are'not to blame me. If&#xD;
the ydung -lady gets sea-sick, or -freckled, -r&#xD;

Eric,swho was sufferino frora-headache, pass-&#xD;

the' captain' looked, in again, and -Electra-&#xD;
thought that no ray of sunshine could-bemore&#xD;
radiant or cheering than his'joyous noble face.&#xD;
" Goodmorning. .I wonder if I look as'&#xD;
much like a drenched lily as you do, Miss&#xD;
Grey ? Doubtless, much more-like a drenched&#xD;
sunflower, you think. Were you alarmed all&#xD;
night ?"'&#xD;
. "-No, sir; -I 'knew that we were not in the&#xD;
hands of Palinurus."&#xD;
" Oh ! thank you for your confidence ! I&#xD;
will tellmy wifasof that, if I live to see 'her&#xD;
again.: I certainly 'did not fall overboard,&#xD;

myself on' my proficiency as a swimmer, I am'&#xD;
very sceptical concerning the mythologic three&#xD;
days performance. Mitchell, I hope a good&#xD;
cup of hot coffee will set your head straight."&#xD;
"How is the storm?    Any abatement ?"&#xD;
asked Eric.-&#xD;
" Not-a whit yet;. but the wind has veered&#xD;
a little, and I think that by twelve o'clock it&#xD;
will break away."&#xD;
"Captain, can I go on deck for a little&#xD;
while ?"&#xD;
' " Whew! 'My dear young lady, you would-&#xD;
not be able to catch your breath again for a-&#xD;
half-hour." You could not stand a moment -&#xD;
'spray nand, wind would blind you, and the&#xD;
waves would take- you overboard-wash you&#xD;
away."&#xD;
" ButsI want to see a genuine violent storm'&#xD;
at sea. I shall probably never have another&#xD;
opportunity."&#xD;
"I will answer for the genuineness of this&#xD;
specimen, if you really want to -look out.&#xD;
Wrap a shawl round your shoulders; give me&#xD;
your hand; step up; look for yourself. No&#xD;
counterfeit --take my- word for that. Squally&#xD;
enough, is n't it ?"&#xD;
A wild howling'waste of waters leaped and&#xD;
rolled- like -leaden mountains against a- wan&#xD;
drab sk3y, where -dun smoke-colored clouds&#xD;
trailed sullenly before the wind. Foam-crown-&#xD;
ed swells towered on either Side the schooner,&#xD;
leanedl oversas if to tieet and crush it,- and&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
broke in wreaths of spray; about the deck,&#xD;
while ghastly sheet-lightning glimmeredcease-,&#xD;
lessly.   .-&#xD;
-"Old Father Neptune must be ina tearing;&#xD;

strangely.&#xD;

" 'Named me -for the, wreck, and followed&#xD;

As swirls -of spray dashed in-her face,-&#xD;
"  Her eyes had looks nikd prisoner birds."&#xD;
S" Captain, I-have read somewhere of a Dutch&#xD;
painter who, in his passionate lgnging to por-&#xD;
tray accurately such scenes as this, had himself&#xD;
-lahed to the deck of a vessel during-a; terrific&#xD;
gale, where he could study and: note the pe-&#xD;
euliar aspects, so diflicult;tp, render correctly.&#xD;
I am tempted-to follow his- example. Doubt-&#xD;

Across that rosy sea tripped magic memey&#xD;
ries. The 'sailor's -heart found its distant ha-'&#xD;
venV in h'e' joyful, tender welcome of his blue-&#xD;
eyed wife-the lisping, birdish tone- of his fair-&#xD;
browed, curly-headed children, stretching their&#xD;
little dimpled arms to clasp his neck; and to&#xD;
the artist-woman came melancholy -thoughts&#xD;
of by-gone years,- shrouded in crumbling gar-,&#xD;
lands-of hopes and feverish aspirations that&#xD;
had fbund their graves-of her future cheer-&#xD;
less life, her lonely destiny.&#xD;
.For some time both were silent ;then-the&#xD;
captain roused himself from his dream of home,&#xD;
and, passing his hand over his eyes,- said : -&#xD;
""Well, Miss Grey, I shall place you on Con-&#xD;
federate soil to-morrow, God willing.",&#xD;
",Then you are going to Mobile ?"&#xD;
"Yes I shall try hard to get in there early&#xD;
in the morning. You will know your fate be-&#xD;
fore many hours."                      '&#xD;
"Do you regard this trial as particularly&#xD;
hazardous ?"&#xD;
" Of course ; the blockading squadrons grow&#xD;
more efficient and expert every day, and some'&#xD;
danger necessarily attends every trial. Mo-&#xD;
bile ought to be pretty well guarded by this&#xD;
time."&#xD;
The. wind was favorable, and the schooner&#xD;
ploughed its way swiftly through the autumn&#xD;
night. The captain did not close his eyes;&#xD;
and just about daylight Electra and Eric,&#xD;
aroused by a sudden running to- and fro, rose,&#xD;
and simultaneously made their appearanceon&#xD;
deck.&#xD;
" What is the matter, Wright ?"&#xD;
r" Matter I why, look ahead, my dear fellow,,&#xD;
and See where we are. Yonder is Sand isl-&#xD;

hardly six miles off, and it will be a tight race&#xD;
-if I get in."              ;&#xD;
There was but a glimmering light rimming&#xD;
the -East, where two or three stars burned with&#xD;
indescribable brilliance and -beauty, and in&#xD;
the gray haze anA wreaths of.: mist- which&#xD;
curled up over the white-capped Waves Elec-&#xD;

"Then I will write to him to meet me in&#xD;

Irenemade no reply, and,-watching her all&#xD;
the whilg, Electra asked:&#xD;
"When did you see him last ? How did he&#xD;
look?"&#xD;
"Theday before he started to Richmond.&#xD;
He was very well, .1 believe;, butlooked&#xD;
,harassed and. paler than usual. He is so ro-&#xD;

thickened and darkened " she thought:&#xD;
"Her father is dead now ; there is no obsta-&#xD;
cle remaining. Al e must loye him,, and yet&#xD;
abe gives no signof interest."&#xD;
".Good-uight, Electra; I hope ygur will sleep&#xD;
well after ypur  fatiguing journey.  Do not&#xD;
get up early. .Iwill send your. breakfast to&#xD;
your room wbenver you wish it."     1&#xD;
She'turned away, but the artist steppedle-&#xD;
fore her and,{eaught up both her hands.&#xD;
Qh,.heg eI, it grieves:Me to see youlook-&#xD;

" My -sorrows can not ,be talked, away.&#xD;
Graves never giveS. back their dead. Good-&#xD;

Electra.looked at. her sadly, wistfully;, and,&#xD;
suddenly throwing her arms about the queen-&#xD;

. She shrank farther back in one corner, and&#xD;
answered with a voice which he could scarcely&#xD;
recognize as hers.,&#xD;
" If you love 'me spare me all questions&#xD;
now.&#xD;
By the glimmer of the carriage-lamps she&#xD;
could see the wagons going to and fro-sone&#xD;
filled with empty coffins, some with mangled&#xD;
sufferers. Now and then weary, spent soldiers&#xD;
sat on the, roadside, or struggled on toward&#xD;
the city which they had saved, with their arms'&#xD;
in slings, or hands bound up, or bloody band-&#xD;
ages across their stern faces. After another&#xD;
hour, when the increasing number of men&#xD;
showed proximity to the scene of danger,&#xD;
Cyrus turned away from the beaten track,&#xD;
and soon the dash of' lights and hum of voices&#xD;
told that they'were near the place of destina-&#xD;
tion. The carriage stopped and Cyrus came&#xD;
to the door.&#xD;
"We are at the lines and I can't drive any&#xD;
nearer. If you will wait, I will go and find&#xD;
master."'&#xD;
It was one o'clock; and as they waited, men&#xD;
passed and repassed with blazing torches, sbme&#xD;
bearingwounded men, whose groans rose above&#xD;
the confusion., The cannonading had long&#xD;
since ceased, and Eric/ called to a group of&#xD;
soldiers belonging to the Infirmary corps.,&#xD;
"What is the last news'from the front?&#xD;
Have the enemy fallen back ?"&#xD;
"Not yet; but they are getting ready to run&#xD;
again, as usual. By daylight they will be out of&#xD;
sight, and we shall be all day to-morrow hunt-&#xD;
ing them up. Their style is to fight -about&#xD;
three hours and run the balance of the twenty-&#xD;
four. They take tothe swamps like all other&#xD;
such miserable varments."   -.,&#xD;
The delay seemed intolerably long, and for&#xD;
the first time an audible moan escaped Irene&#xD;
just as Cyrus came back accompanied by a&#xD;
mutiled figure.&#xD;
" Irene, my child."&#xD;
She leaned out till her face nearly touched&#xD;
Dr. Arnold's. .   .-.&#xD;
" Only tell me that he is alive and I can&#xD;
bear all else."&#xD;
" He is alive, and sleeping just now.- Can&#xD;
you control yourself if I take you to him ?"&#xD;
"Yes ; you need not fear that I will disturb&#xD;
him. 'Let me go to him"'&#xD;
He gave her his arm andled her through the&#xD;
drizzling ,rain for sonie distance-avoiding,:as&#xD;
much as, possible, the groups of wounded,&#xD;
where urgeons were at their sad work. Fi-&#xD;
nally, before a small tent, he paused, ;and&#xD;
whispered.:&#xD;
"Nerve yourself, dear child."&#xD;
"Is there no;hope ?" -&#xD;
She agept aside her long mourning-veil and&#xD;
'gazed imploringly. into his face.&#xD;
Tears filled his eyes, and, hastily averting&#xD;
his 'head, he raised the curtain of the tent and&#xD;
drew her inside.        -&#xD;
A candle burned dimly in one corner, and&#xD;
&#xD;
here, on a pallet of straw, over whigh a blank-&#xD;
.et had been thrown, lay the powerful form of&#xD;
the dauntless leader, whose deeds of desperate&#xD;
daring had so electrified his worshipping coin-&#xD;
mand but a few hours before. The ,i0ble&#xD;
head was pillowed on a knapsack.; one hand&#xD;
pressed his heart, while the .other 4rooped&#xD;
nerveless at his side, and .the .breast of hi&#xD;
coat was -saturated with the blood, which at&#xD;
intervals- oozed through the, bandages ,and&#xD;
dripped upon, the straw. The tert was silent&#xD;
as a cemetery, and.not a sound passed Irene'.&#xD;
white fixed lips as she bent down and looked&#xD;
upon the loved face, strangely beautiful in its&#xD;
pallid repose. The shadowy wings of theb :tter&#xD;
By-Gone hovered no longer pver the features,&#xD;
darkening theit chiselled perfection; a tranquil&#xD;
half-smile parted tie lips and unbent the lines&#xD;
between the finely-arched black bgws.&#xD;
Sinlking softly on the floor of the tent, Irene&#xD;
rested. her chin on her folded hands.and&#xD;
calmly watched the deep .sleep. So passed&#xD;
three-quarters of a  hour; then, as PLJimold&#xD;
cautiously put his fingers on the pulse, the&#xD;
sufferer opened his eyes.&#xD;
Irene was. partially in the shade,.but, as she&#xD;
leaned :forward, a sudden, bewildered smile&#xD;
lighted his countenance; he-started, up axd&#xD;
extended one arm.&#xD;
"Irene! My darling! Do I dream? 'or are&#xD;
you indeed with me ?"&#xD;
"I have come to nurse you, Russell; but if&#xD;
you do not calm yourself the doctor will send&#xD;
me -away."&#xD;
She took the outstretched hand in both&#xD;
hers, and pressed her lips repeatedly upon it.&#xD;
"Come close to me. I t am helpless now,'&#xD;
and can not go to you."&#xD;
She seated herself on the edge of the straw,&#xD;
laid her shawl in her lap,a  tin 'his head,-&#xD;
rested it on the soft woollen fol s. Pr. 'Arnold&#xD;
removed the warm cloth soaked with blood,&#xD;
placed a cold,,dripping towel on .thew gaping&#xD;
wound, and, after tightening the -bandages to&#xD;
check the hemorhage, passed out of the tent,&#xD;
leaving the two alone.&#xD;
" Oh, Irene ! this is a joy I never hoped for.&#xD;
I went at night to the hospital in Richmiond,&#xD;
just to get a'gliimpse of you--to feast my eyes&#xD;
with anothersight of your dear, dearace 1,I&#xD;
watched yo  p urperinglihe an angel o geQ&#xD;
and wounded soldiers, and Ienvie' thes the&#xD;
touch of your hand-the ,msund pf ypur voice.&#xD;
I little expected tQ dielin your arms. Tis&#xD;
reconciles me to my 'fate ; this compensates for&#xD;
all!"&#xD;
Her fingers tenderly  qhoea4d the black&#xD;
locks that clung to his templ s, and, beid&#xD;
down, she kissed his forehead. 'hs gu'nu&#xD;
arn stole up around her peekdreyr her fie&#xD;
to his, and his lips pressed hers again and&#xD;
again&#xD;
"PIear Urissell; you, pns be quist, or you&#xD;
will exhau$t yourself. Try to sleep;--it will&#xD;
refresh, strengthen you."&#xD;

" ; I work steadily-upon it, I can soon-finish&#xD;

war ends., After all, Irene, the joy of success&#xD;
does not equal that. which attends-the patient&#xD;
working. Perhaps it is because 'anticipation&#xD;
is the 'purest part of pleasure.'  I love pny&#xD;
work; no maor woman ever loved it better;&#xD;
andyet their is a painful -feeling of isolation,&#xD;
of loneliness, *hieh steals over me sometimes&#xD;

ful to'know that, when the labor is ended and&#xD;
a new chaplet encircles my brow, I shall have&#xD;
no one, but you to whom I can turn for sympa-&#xD;

" Electra, it is very true that single woman&#xD;
have trials for which a thoughtless, happy.&#xD;
world hashlittle sympathy. But lonely lives&#xD;
are not necessarily joyless ; they should be, of&#xD;
all'others, fmost usetl. The head of a house-&#xD;
hold, a wife and mother, is occupied with&#xD;
family cares and affections-can find little-&#xD;
time for considering the comfort or contribut-&#xD;
ing to the enjoyment of any 'beyond the home-&#xD;
circle. Doubtless' she is happier,' far happier&#xD;
than the unmarried woman; but to the last&#xD;
belongs the privilege of carrying light and&#xD;
blessings to ma'ny'firesides-of being the friend,&#xD;
and helper of hundreds; and because she bt&#xD;
longs exclusively to ,o one, her heart expand&#xD;
to, all her su firing fellow-creatures. In my&#xD;
childhood I always thought of Old-Maids with&#xD;
a sensation of contempt. and repulsion ; now I&#xD;
regard those among them.who preserve their&#xD;
natures from cynicism and querulousness, and&#xD;
prove themselves social evangels of mercy, as&#xD;
an uncrowned host of martyrs. Electra, re-&#xD;
member otler words of tie same vigorous, gift-&#xD;
ed woman whom you so often quote :&#xD;
"'And' since we needs must hunger--better, for -man's&#xD;
love.&#xD;

Than great cnvictious t let us bear our weights,&#xD;
Preferring dreary hearths to desert soui  -&#xD;
",Remember that, the woman who dales to&#xD;
live .alone, and be sneered at, is braver and&#xD;
nobler and batter than, she who escapes both&#xD;
in a'loveless marriage. It is true.that you and&#xD;
I are very lonely, and yet our future, holds&#xD;
much that is bright. You have the profession&#xD;
you love, so well and our now School ot Design&#xD;
to, engage your thoughts; and I a thousand&#xD;
claims- on my ~time ; and. attention. I, have&#xD;
Uncle Eric to take care of and to love; and Dr.&#xD;
Ariold, who is, growing quite infirm, has&#xD;
promised me'that; as soon as he can be' spared&#xD;
from the 'hospitals, he will make his hone with&#xD;
us. Whn this storm of war has ppent itself,&#xD;
your uncle's family will return from Europe&#xD;
and. reside here with you. Harvey, too, will&#xD;
come to W      '=to live-will probably take&#xD;
charge of Mr. Oampbell's church--and we shall&#xD;
have the pleasure and, benefit of his constant&#xD;
counsel. If I could see you a member of thgt&#xD;
church I should be better satisfied-and you&#xD;
wouldbe happier.".&#xD;
"I would join, to-morrow, if therdby I could&#xD;
acquire your 'sublime faith and strength,,and&#xD;
resignation. Oh, Irene I my friend and com-&#xD;
forter ! I want ,to live differently in 'future.&#xD;
Once . was wedded to life and ,ny Art--pre-&#xD;

I cared to attain ; now I desire to spend m&#xD;
remaining years .so that I may meet Russel&#xD;

"Electra, take Christ for .your model, 'in-&#xD;
stead of an erring human being like-yourself,&#xD;
constantly falling short of her own .duty.,&#xD;
With Harvey to direct us, we ought to accent-&#xD;
plish a world of good, here in sight of Russell's.&#xD;
grave.  Cheer up I   God's great'vineyard&#xD;
stretches before us, cdlling forlaborers. Hand&#xD;
in hand we will go in and work till, evening&#xD;
shades close over us; then lift up, in: token Of&#xD;
our faithfulness, rich ripe clusters of purple&#xD;
fruitage. You and I have much to do during&#xD;
these-days of gloom and national trial-forupon&#xD;
the purity, the devotion, and.the patriotism of&#xD;
the women of our land, rrot less than upon the&#xD;
heroism of our armies, depends our national&#xD;
salvation.. To jealously guard our honies and&#xD;
social circles from the inroads of corruption,&#xD;
to keep the fires of patriotism burning upon-&#xD;
the altars of the South, to sustain ,and en-&#xD;
courage those who are wrestling along the.&#xD;
border for our birthright of freedom, is the:&#xD;
consecrated work to which we are called; and,&#xD;
'beyond this bloody baptism open vistas of life-&#xD;
long usefulness, when the reign of wrong and&#xD;
tyranny is ended, when the roar of battle, 'the&#xD;
blast of bugle,- and beat. of drum is hushed&#xD;
among our hills, and Peace I blessed Peace !&#xD;
again makes her abode in our smiling, flowery'&#xD;
valleys. Hasten the hour, oli! my God 'I&#xD;
when her white wings shall -hover over us&#xD;
once more I"&#xD;
The eyes of the artist went back to the&#xD;
stainless robes and seraphic face of her pictured&#xD;
Peace in the loved "Modern Macaria," and, as&#xD;
&#xD;
sha resumed her work, her brow  feared the&#xD;
countenance kindled as in days of yore bitter&#xD;
memories hushed their moans. and fell asleep&#xD;
at the wizard-touch of her profession ,and the&#xD;
stormy, stricken soul found balm andrest in.&#xD;
