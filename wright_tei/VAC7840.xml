wbo knew her, and was she to blame if, undo&#xD;
signedly, she awoke feelings of admiration i~&#xD;
th~ breasts of others besides her own adopteel&#xD;
cb~en one.&#xD;
She was the queen at the w~ddi4g of hex&#xD;
cousin Ellen Gray, on the night of the 24th 01&#xD;
June, When all the etars sang out aiid the&#xD;
~epbyrs danced to the lute-tunes of Sylvan&#xD;
elves, and rustled with their wings the full.&#xD;

party was large and attended by all ~he neigh-&#xD;
b~rs, great and small, who had come en ma.we&#xD;
to do' honor to Miss Ellen and her czcellent&#xD;
~atpnded, Allan Thompson. it was there My-&#xD;
ra first saw oi~e oF' whom 'she had heard much&#xD;
said n his praise, Wilhi~m Morgan, from Y-&#xD;
district, the dashing son of Matthew Morgan, the&#xD;
Indian Land Pknter. lit was said that he in-&#xD;
tended soon to move into the neighborhood to&#xD;
live'permanently. it w~is very evident to all&#xD;
the ,v~sitora that young Morgati was captivated;&#xD;
for Miss ~i~ece could not move without his at-&#xD;
tentions. 'Myra eeemed'coldly indiffer9nt, but&#xD;
could nqt reject the advances of so recent an&#xD;
aoquaintanoe. And she did not like his man-&#xD;
ners. There was somethiu~ of a callous na-&#xD;
ture in his conversation, an imperiousness of&#xD;
look and gesture that had a repulsive effect&#xD;
epon all whom he appronched.&#xD;
'If Miss Bruce will &amp;amp;llow me, I will pay her&#xD;
many visits before 21 leave the neighborhood.'&#xD;
'Certainly, air,' responded Myra, 'an a friend&#xD;
I Would be happy to see you at any time.'&#xD;
'And i'll be sure to leave my heart whenj&#xD;
~go away, as a pledge that I~ may return and&#xD;
olaim it.&#xD;
'Oh, don't do so, Mr. Morgan,' the gift I will&#xD;
not have~ you must keep it for another.'&#xD;
Billy ikorgari settled soon after at B-,&#xD;
purchased the fine woodland plantation on&#xD;
White Oak creek, atid took tho appointment of&#xD;
Postmaster at . l~-.-- office, instead of Joel&#xD;
~teadnlan, whio 'moved to the West. lie had&#xD;
gone often to see Myra, and employed all the,&#xD;
&#xD;
arts ofaa incarnating address to indues her ~e&#xD;
i become his wife. She steadily resisted his ad-&#xD;
vance., and' rejected finally his suit, uDrSSOrV-&#xD;
edly stating her attachment to Ernest, and that&#xD;
r bctbing but death could over dissolve th~ en-&#xD;
cred bond upon which she had entered. This&#xD;
was sufficient for her, and was seemingly&#xD;
sufficient for Morgan; but Morgan was born~a&#xD;
villain, and quietly thereafter resumed a care-&#xD;
r less indifference to Myra and the world. But&#xD;
I his heart was bent on thwarting her futnie&#xD;
I happiness and he only awaited the develop-&#xD;
monte of futureevonts to carry his purpose in-&#xD;
to execution. It was two niontha after his re-&#xD;
I section when a letter came for Miss Myra&#xD;
Bruce, post-marked Eatonton, Ga. [t was&#xD;
skilfully opened by Morgan, read, and the seal&#xD;
carefully replaced, and allowed to pass through&#xD;
to its destination. jt was thus that he began&#xD;
his course of satanic duplicity, feeling perfect-&#xD;
ly secure from detectior~. This first letter wan&#xD;
soon answered, and~ the answer carefully read&#xD;
by the'postmaster as before, and sent on to itS&#xD;
destination. The letter of Erne'st was as ftd-&#xD;

Myras letter was a much longer~ one, and&#xD;

in the holy boiids of wedlock1 and wound up&#xD;
by describing the courtship of Billy Morgan~&#xD;
and thorebXiff she gave him, denouncing him&#xD;
as unworthy of tl~ love of any good woman.&#xD;
Billy's heart, when he read all this, was filled&#xD;
wiVh revenge, and he vowed to humble Myra's&#xD;
pride, if within th~ power of man to do it. But&#xD;

November, 18 ~ 'Ernest ~1ollingswortb, in the&#xD;
twonty-fi!tb year o( his age. He bad not been&#xD;
long a resident el that county, but was esteem-&#xD;
ed by all who.know him. A man of fine talent~s&#xD;
and udet~uti~able' industry, be led a life of much&#xD;
usefulness. 'His friends, though far distant,&#xD;
will meura, witb peculiar sorrow', the loss of&#xD;
one so true to himself, his country, and his&#xD;
God.'&#xD;
&#xD;
Several months after, another long uniseiro&#xD;
came from flollingsworth~ Ho had reacb~dbi~&#xD;
destination In the West.. vomm'onced operations&#xD;
in clearing and .building, and expressed his,&#xD;
gniutitude for the prompt answer -which his 'be-&#xD;
loved had given to' hiS first letter. He spoke&#xD;
eheeringly of the prospects. before him for sue.&#xD;
bess; had made but few acquaintances, he aaid,~&#xD;
and never left the place unless on the most&#xD;
urgent business. The three years, be ~vent on&#xD;
to say, would fly fast, for his mind would tie&#xD;
intensely engaged in his new o~cupatioa, for&#xD;
he did not intend to let irons burn. Tbis letter&#xD;
Morgan destroyed, and sent one in Its stead,&#xD;
whIch simply stated facts,/ but did not breathe&#xD;
those sentiments of ~evotion contained in the&#xD;
original. It was shortly afier answering tbis,&#xD;
and reproving Ernest for his measured coldness,&#xD;
that Myra discovered, by an a9eidontal circutu-'&#xD;
atanca, the stratagem that Mor~au had attempt&#xD;
ed to palm upon her.&#xD;
There was a whitej~id in the employ 'of Mor-&#xD;
gan, whose suspicions were aroused by Billy's&#xD;
oloseting himself so frequently in the little&#xD;
back roo~n,.with lighted candle. 'So one night,&#xD;
he thought he would take a peep. in at the lit.&#xD;
tie window. Billy hnd a habit of talking to&#xD;
himself aloud, a habit of which he was scarcely&#xD;
conscious himself, from his peculiar tempera.&#xD;
went, so that Tommy Horn, w.hen he to~k his&#xD;
~ook in af the window, not only ~aw bu~ beard.&#xD;
He heard Billy say, 'now, this will do. No-&#xD;
body ca~ heat that. On, yca J ~ Myra you're&#xD;
very proud, but you shall never marry that ras-&#xD;
cal Hollingsworth. Three years, iud~ed I I'll&#xD;

nice, but who caix tell the difi'v.rence between&#xD;

All tl:ia Tommy dii~b-~scd In Myr;, ~'or My'a&#xD;

- nrr~ingeO so as to keep up Morgan's deception,&#xD;
and wage Tommy pr~Aai~e faithfully to watch&#xD;
him, soixs to secure future evidence of .hi~&#xD;
guilt. This Tommy did, and even abstracted&#xD;
his counterIcix. letters from Morgan's desk. fox&#xD;
Myra to read. So the plot went magically on&#xD;
in Morgan's estimation. His- descriptive letter.&#xD;
wore growing colder and colder, and Myra was,&#xD;
in his imagination, almost dying of grief. But&#xD;
&#xD;
'ONa WHO KNISW hIM.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Myra was a spectacle of' woe to all with&#xD;
whom shxe~ associated, after the !'eeeptiou of this&#xD;
shocking tiewa. She rarely left her fin&#xD;

wily'Mo~gaa was elated, as if another's qo'~n-&#xD;

seemed to interpose to furthe4 his pIans,~ end.&#xD;

a long ti~ne, a section was made through it~&#xD;
The two were then loose at one end and could&#xD;
be ~,roved nj) or down, or taken entirely out, as&#xD;
the case might require. Mr. Weller assiste'i&#xD;
IU*n*at In all these efforts, though he had not&#xD;
~uoh en-engtb. to work at.it. His wound still&#xD;
dl.s~bled him. It was about three weeks before&#xD;
ap?~ng Qourt, they bad lain in jail for nearly&#xD;
. lo~a~ months already~ and. it was now high time&#xD;
thtt o~nething should be done, if at all. They&#xD;
tore their blankets ir~to long shreds, and fast.&#xD;
ened them securely together, end' attached the&#xD;
~hole t~ one of the iron bars of their window.&#xD;
~Wlien the *bole was completed, they conolud.&#xD;
to make the attempt at midnight.. But bow&#xD;
get ~way, before they could be overhauled,&#xD;
was the difficulty. 'They fell upon this expe.&#xD;
die~t. There was a large barn in sight of the&#xD;
jail, piled up to the roof with hay. If they&#xD;
oould get up' into the barn, and stay 'there all&#xD;
next day, the next night 'they could get away,&#xD;
for they kDeW that the country would be scoured&#xD;
en 'the ensuing day. So they did. At the ap-&#xD;
pointed hour, jiaving noiselessly removed the&#xD;
bars and easily slid down the improvised rope~&#xD;
and having cleared the plank fence of the j~iil&#xD;
yard, they climbed up to the top of the hay&#xD;
loft, and concealed themselves under the soft&#xD;
hay'ao' perfectly that 'no ona would ever dream&#xD;
:~Of such' '~' thing. Thus' they remained th6re&#xD;
'tllrongh the da~, and it was just as they had&#xD;
predicted. ' A great outcry 'was raised by the&#xD;
town's people, au*x a search was' instituted by&#xD;
mounted men. Some swore they saw them&#xD;
going u~ the Greytown road, others thought&#xD;
they *ent down the 1~advilIe Turnpike, but by&#xD;
night the runners 'bed returned, and found no&#xD;
*        trace of the tugitives. At' midnight, when all&#xD;
the sown was in a deep hush, our runaways&#xD;
stol6 quietly frerri the barn loti., and madi~ their&#xD;
way, safely eut into the country. What were&#xD;
they now t#,do? . Together they footed it to&#xD;
Missiseippi,~keeping in their route all the set-&#xD;
tied country as they advanced; one week&#xD;
working as day laborers on some farm, to en-&#xD;
able them the next week no pay their' way.&#xD;
Thus several months passed away ere they felt&#xD;
themselves comPletely out. of danger. Weller&#xD;
was goii~g home by way of Southern Mi~ai~&#xD;
&#xD;
sippi, and Ernest now, severed as be was fLv~&#xD;
all connection with 'the farm in Alabama~ de-&#xD;
termined to seek his fortune in the Mississippi&#xD;
Valley. Of course ho could not "'Write home&#xD;
without risking a chance of recapture. In the.&#xD;
Valley he commenced as day laborer, and soeu&#xD;
became overseer. Here he accumulated rapidly,&#xD;
bought lands and slaves, and rose In ~ few&#xD;
~eara to be ~ne -of the wealthiest and' moat&#xD;
successful planters in the Valley. H~ made&#xD;
but t'ew friends there, living rather a ~reclu~e&#xD;
life Than. otherwise. Soon after Ernest's disap.'&#xD;
pparance from the scene of hiS labors in North&#xD;
Alabama, some one had written Ezra Hopkins&#xD;
that his over~eer had run away, but that the&#xD;
farm had been left in good fix. Hopkins sent&#xD;
out-another mah to take charg'~ of it, and was&#xD;
puzzle          why Holhingswor~h should&#xD;
have dese     im so soon, having as yet re-&#xD;
ceiyed no pay.&#xD;
Myra mourned him as dead, and refused ~e&#xD;
be .coniforte&amp;amp; Morgan renewed his suit frowi&#xD;
time to time, but she told him she had rather&#xD;
die than to marry him. Twice three years had&#xD;
expired from the date ~ Erne.st's departure,&#xD;
and her fathSr had entei~hd the dark vaijey Of,&#xD;
the shadow of death. He died intestate; his&#xD;
effects were sold, and morgan bought the lands,&#xD;
overbidding the means of the widow to retain&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Mother and daughter were thus reduced t~&#xD;
the necessity of living with Jease Clifto; or 'of&#xD;
becoming depeadant on the forb'earance of&#xD;
Morgan.&#xD;
They went to the hospitable ro6f of their&#xD;
aged parents, who, with open arms and warm&#xD;
hearts, received them.&#xD;
Morgan had become the oppressor and a-I-&#xD;
vantage-taker of all classes.' He shaved 'uotea,&#xD;
bought and sold negroes, traded and trafficked&#xD;
in every available product, and as many be-.&#xD;
lieved, with any and everybody. Nothing was&#xD;
tho low or vil~ for him to do, if ther -by he&#xD;
made mousy. i~verybody'hated him, and many&#xD;
fesi-ed his power. There is no question but&#xD;
that the note for fifteen hundred brought in&#xD;
against the estate of John Bruce after his&#xD;
i~eath,' was a forged one, for rio one had any&#xD;
knowledge of such a trunsRction between the'&#xD;
parties.&#xD;
There was one, however, who had an eye&#xD;
upon him, and it was no other than . Tommy&#xD;
Horn, who, though esteemed ignorant by all&#xD;
the neighbors, yet possessed a great fund of&#xD;
quiet sagacity. 11e treasured up all of Mor-&#xD;
han's miadoings for future retribution, and dis-&#xD;
closed to Miss Myra only his petty villainies.&#xD;
Morgan had no fault to find with hini; he&#xD;
thought he was a fool, and consequently that&#xD;

&amp;amp;&#xD;
&#xD;

*~ mu t4YYZI&#xD;
he couhi not perceiv, his ebliquitien, and he&#xD;
knew he was attentive to his daily business,&#xD;
more so than his negroes. He had only ~te&#xD;
groom his horse, and keep a good fire in Mor-&#xD;
gan'p rooms. Latterly Morgan had made seve-&#xD;
ral trips to North Carolina, for the purchase of&#xD;
slaves,'with the view of taking them West for&#xD;
sale. In his route ho had bacoin~ acquainted&#xD;
with the pretty village of Bloomfield, and a&#xD;
certain cupolaed residence, and its fair inhabi-&#xD;
tants. After learning, In incidental converse.&#xD;
tion, the story of the Hollingswortbs, he mani~&#xD;
fea.od himself much smitten with the charms&#xD;
'of Mary Wineberg, for be had heard of Hol-&#xD;
lingsworth's death and knew that the vast pro.&#xD;
perty accumulated at Wilmington was in store&#xD;
for the Wineberge. He was cunning enough,&#xD;
however, not to disclose to them any knowledge&#xD;
of Hollingsworth, Mary had another beau, for&#xD;
whom she bad become partially fond, and El.&#xD;
lick Johnson looked with an~ idiolls eye upon&#xD;
the ne# corner. . He knew tha/t' such were, of&#xD;
all men, the most degraded, but Mary seemed&#xD;
dazzled at the tine appearance of Morgan, and&#xD;
did not discourage his advances. Her mother&#xD;
warned, but -Mary seemed bewildered. Mor-'&#xD;
gsa knew how to boast of his great wealth, so&#xD;
invidiously as not to arouse a suspicion of his&#xD;
infidelity; so that Mary actually fell in love&#xD;
wit , as it appeared, and afte e was&#xD;
gone thre damper upon tentions of&#xD;
her quandam a mir , a umNe Buick John-&#xD;
son. She mused thus, 'well, I'll wait. Mr.&#xD;
Morgan may come back, and ofier me his band;&#xD;
he seems an excellent match, and Ellick! I'm&#xD;
not engaged to him. He might have proposed&#xD;
long ago, the bashful fellow, and then I'd have&#xD;
no excuse. Whose fault is it? his I'm sure.' I&#xD;
know Ehlick won't give me up soon, and if-and&#xD;
if I don't marry-then I moy-~ Thus her&#xD;
idle thoughts ran en like tempestuous clouds&#xD;
drifting along the misty plain of her mind, and&#xD;
she was thoughtlessly c~ruel, not knowing how&#xD;
much paul and unhappiness she was entailing&#xD;
upon others.&#xD;
'Sister Mary,' Peggy would often say to her,&#xD;
'if you don't marry Buick, I'll cut you out the&#xD;
very first chance. I declare, it's a shame. 1&#xD;
wouldn't do a dog so, sa you done Ellick last&#xD;
night.' 'Your attentions, Mr. Johnson I can't&#xD;
receive any more'; oh, you're a nice one, and&#xD;
all for that poppinjay, speculating Morgan.&#xD;
You'll b~ sorry for" it some day, I tell you.'&#xD;
Thus Peggy berated her sister, but Mary said&#xD;
she-did not deserve such treatment. She might&#xD;
have Ehlick for what she cared, but as for her,&#xD;
she intended to have her own choice, or die an&#xD;
old maid.&#xD;

Mrs. ~Wineberg suspected at once It was her&#xD;
brother, whom she had not beard from for&#xD;
twenty years, but why this concealment \ske&#xD;
could not understand. At all evdats, she could&#xD;
write at once to'Kinlock &amp;amp; Co., that the heir to&#xD;
the Uolhingsworth estate was still living, and&#xD;
though she had no proof o? it, she was fully&#xD;
satisfied upon that ~ubject. That time, she had&#xD;
no doubt, would reveal more, and that as soon&#xD;
as she learned more she would disclose it.&#xD;
'Mr. Halstead, I cannot tell you what 1&#xD;
would take for the two, said Billy Morgan to&#xD;
Hollingsworth, who, since his escape from the&#xD;
Tennessee prison, had assumed the name o~ his&#xD;
guardian. &amp;amp; They were favorite negroes of Mra.&#xD;
Blacklock, of Bloo'nfleld, N. C., aiid were sold&#xD;
for no fault, only to pay a mortgage ef long&#xD;
standing. Mrs. Wineberg wlinted the girl for&#xD;
her daughter Mary, but would not pay enough,&#xD;
ro I kept them for sale.'&#xD;
'Well P11 give you fourteen hundred,' said&#xD;
Halatead. 'Are you satisfied? zu are? Well,&#xD;
you must stay with me tonight, and tell me&#xD;
all about the people of your country. I am' a&#xD;
North Carolinian myself, but don't know much&#xD;
about the old State, for I left many years ago:'&#xD;

&#xD;
the testament of a robber. Verily Providence&#xD;

'True,' rephed Ernest, 'but who knows&#xD;
what good is to result from these unforeseen&#xD;
developments. No man's life is complete1 but&#xD;
as it is shaped L,' Divine agencies, and may&#xD;
you yet live to bless the day, when you may&#xD;
look back, and ho thankful that you accepted.&#xD;
this cumbrons' trust.'&#xD;
After consultation, the two friends proceeded&#xD;
to act in accordance with the directions of the&#xD;
tesยฑator. It was. n~6t difflault. to I~nd the log&#xD;
cabin on Bush Mountain, but it was very, diffi-&#xD;
cult to remove . the weighty stone which&#xD;
eovored the treasure, and their 'acquaintance&#xD;
with natural philosophy was. sorely put to the&#xD;
test to invent~ ~ oompound.lever,' by which it&#xD;
could be overturned. At length, ,,afuer patimit&#xD;
efforts, they succeeded, but ~t much rust had&#xD;
accumulated in the lock that was not ea'w to&#xD;
make the key available in ~eniqg it.. After'&#xD;
repeated trials, however, this was 'elTeoted, the&#xD;
treasure removed, the lid replaced, and the&#xD;
huge stone rolled again to its superincumbent&#xD;
position. Each pair of sadlle-bage beIongi~g~o&#xD;
the tWo, received its weIght of the treasure,&#xD;
and they returned as hastily as possible to&#xD;
tow.ia in order to avoid ~nspi'oion, and to de-&#xD;
posit the rloli burden in the privacy of their&#xD;
apartment. Ernest became the banker and&#xD;
the guardian of the treasure, and Mr. Weller&#xD;
commenced his traveling operations of ox-&#xD;
eban~e brokerage, by which be found that he&#xD;
increased considerably the original aniount of&#xD;
the estate, (or gold readily demanded a pre-&#xD;
mium iii all of the Tennessee banks. Three&#xD;
weeks were thus consumed when, this part of&#xD;
the business being nosomphished, Mr. Weller&#xD;
and l~rneet parted ~he one fbi- his home in&#xD;
Alabama, the other to pursue his onward&#xD;
journey to his native land.&#xD;
At I'inewood 4~all the Brothers Holkins had&#xD;
been long constant visitors, and Mrs. Wvhler,&#xD;
in thO exercise of her maternal jurisprudence,&#xD;
did not regard "the likelihood of matrimonial&#xD;
alliance with them' by ,any means with die-&#xD;
favor. The elder brother, Elias, was an ox-&#xD;
amplar of industry and hardy manhood to all&#xD;
the youth of the neighborhood. The family,&#xD;
since their settlement in Alabama, bad risen,&#xD;
by hard labor, to quite a respectable position&#xD;
in society, and Elias was the main stake who&#xD;
had pushed on their little fortune to 'its&#xD;
present zenith of success. 'They had secured a&#xD;
small but quite productive farm,' and, by the&#xD;
production of cotton, with careful~ management,&#xD;
had become ~the' owners of a few' valuable&#xD;
slaves. The younger brothm, Isaac, ~mad not&#xD;
yetarrived at that'a&amp;amp;e at which such a tbing as&#xD;
&#xD;
matrimony might he looked for. It will no~&#xD;
surprise the 'inquisitive to lenin that Dettie's&#xD;
att-achment to Elms became strong, almost ~at&#xD;
its inception. Many a grape and muscadine&#xD;
hunt had the boys and girls had together&#xD;
through the thick~try and vine-entangled&#xD;
forest, and - many a merry swng from a' high&#xD;
oak bough, over the ravine, in the old' p~sture-&#xD;
field had they enjoyed in the wildness and'&#xD;
harmony of youthful play. Elias ,knew that&#xD;
Bettie was the best housekoeprin all Gone-&#xD;
cuh, and he loved her not the l~ss on this ac-&#xD;
Count, inasmuch as he knew that, if success&#xD;
should ever cr9wn his efforts, he taust be the&#xD;
architect of his own fortunes, and lie had&#xD;
learned the value of home economy. The first&#xD;
essay of ]~Iias in love-making wss blutidering&#xD;
az~d lame, as what boy's is not; bulL' Dettic&#xD;
did not hide her face to giggle, as many silly&#xD;
maidens do, buL' looked through her smiles&#xD;
and blushes with such a tender e~reesion,&#xD;
that, though she answered n~ a word, Ehias&#xD;
could see that be held the first place in her&#xD;
sil~ctions. Elias felt greatly restrained while&#xD;
Mr. Weller was st home, and now that he ws~&#xD;
gone on a stay of some months, a t1~ic opj*r-&#xD;
tunity would be afforded him tsr real earnes'~&#xD;
courtship. It was long before ho could get&#xD;
himself up' to the point of popping. tho '~ues-&#xD;
tieD, and he had postponed the terrible ordea&#xD;
froto week to week, till he began to tear that&#xD;
be could not do it. He had, iii his iniagina-&#xD;
tion, woven many pretty speeches, but, '~t th~s&#xD;
orit.ical moment, hi8 throbbing heart woul I&#xD;
scatter them away, and his husky' tongue re-&#xD;
fuse to call them back again.&#xD;
But one evening in November, uvhile'en joy-&#xD;
ing a fine flow of spirits in tek a. 'tar with'&#xD;
Bettie before a snug fire hi the little parlor,&#xD;
he had entered, without a struggle,' into th~&#xD;
lively and charming frame of ease ln~ire&amp;amp;by'&#xD;
confidence, and found soon, to his suir$i~e&#xD;
that he was talking to Bettie of marriage, calf&#xD;
tug her all' sorts of pretty names, timid u~f'olding&#xD;
the long locked up treasures of his love,' while&#xD;
she responsively sighed her assent, iuud-tende-r'-&#xD;

It was the ~ame night that Mi-. Weller cambe&#xD;

ovinced their good sense. it was not allowed&#xD;
~o go outside of the family circle how Myra&#xD;

know that she was Annie's friend, and that&#xD;
The had come to pay her a visit. Annie, from'&#xD;
aer own ~ne wardrobe, suited Myra in dresses,&#xD;
and the friends tog~t~or took the rounds of&#xD;
the opening ~vinter parties. Many appeared&#xD;
captivated with Myra's 1~eauty, and it was ac-&#xD;
knowledged by all that the attraction's of Mr.&#xD;
t~eyton'B house were much increased by her&#xD;
presence. But Myra, notwithstanding the&#xD;
pleasure of' mingling in society, longed' to be&#xD;

Don't be ~ny knowledge of Myra; for the penalty for&#xD;
and go such a detention, would, on conviction, ruin&#xD;
her. Therefore, abc remained quiet, preferring&#xD;
d lightly to pursue the coui'~o above explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
Morgan had' taken his forged papers to the&#xD;
bankers at Wilmington, only to moot with dis.&#xD;
appointment. They told him that they were&#xD;
not to be caught by straws; that they knew&#xD;
something about the, establishment of old&#xD;
claims ; that they believed the real heir might&#xD;
be still living, and if ~so, that the" paper i&#xD;
wiuch he presented, would then clearly appear&#xD;
~a forgery, and they advised him not to produce&#xD;
them any more till be received notice from theta&#xD;
that he could do so. This they said to scare&#xD;
him oft', believing that the claim was fraud.&#xD;
lent, and if so, Morgan would be af~aid to&#xD;
trouble them with its coimidoration any wore.&#xD;
&#xD;
This was quite a different resuit from what&#xD;
Morgan expected; for he had hoped at least to&#xD;
make a favorable impression upon the baker~&#xD;
but Mrs. Wineberg's communication had fore-&#xD;
warned, and though they had heard nothing&#xD;
latterly from that source, they thought it their&#xD;
duty to wait. Morgan was seriously noaplussod&#xD;
in briag balked so often in his designs against&#xD;
Myra, and consoled himself that in many other&#xD;
practices of the kind he had been successful,&#xD;
~nd in the last resort, if ho failed to ruin her&#xD;
by causing her complete misery, he could take&#xD;
vengeance by poisoning his victim, for he&#xD;
knew she had the power of ruining him for&#xD;

Yes, Elizabeth knew it well; it w~s plainly&#xD;

In consideration of the fatigue of the' fore.&#xD;
gbin~. night, thelittle housekeeper was ir&#xD;
thoughtful the morning after the party, and&#xD;
Ri4erlaiids slept in peace till 'ten o'clock, It&#xD;
was 'at that h~nr~ that Elizabeth opened her&#xD;

She todk~the cheerfullittIe face between her&#xD;

'You have good eyes,'darling-opeii, clear,&#xD;
and honest, like somebody J"e seen. I like ft&#xD;
'a ~   you to look at me; as Martin ~orke says, 'I si&#xD;
approve your lookh3g'at me. i~l55 me again.'&#xD;
And Elizgbeth held her close and kissed her c&#xD;
three or four times before she would relea~o the a&#xD;
astonished prisoner. Annie was fairly as-&#xD;
+      tounded. A voluntary andearnest kiss from ~&#xD;
her friend! Wonderful!                   t&#xD;
'What an. astonishing mood to be sure!-&#xD;
*'~    ~at has come over you, to be so affectionate? ~&#xD;
~        I shall look for Elias to kiss rue next, or the (&#xD;
planet Jupiter to embrace me.'&#xD;
~he was released now and went into the I&#xD;
next voom. Elizabeth laughed heartily at her&#xD;
similar rousing of Lydia, who was amazed at&#xD;
K      such proceedings~ being awaked by a perfect&#xD;
A       shower of kisses. Becoming jealous of this&#xD;
monopoly of sweet lips, l~llizabeth rushed .to&#xD;
the resene, and a romp ensued. It was brokefl&#xD;
a      up however by the bi~isk little housekeeper,&#xD;
wI~o warned them to be dressed in ten nun-&#xD;
utes, and went' down jingling her keys. All&#xD;
was pleasant at the breakfast table. Eliza-&#xD;
beth's face wore such a calm and happy cx-&#xD;
'4~-" 'pression, yet withal so serious; that Alfred de-&#xD;
clared she must be engaged. - 'For,' he con-&#xD;
tinned, 'our landlady's daughter looked just&#xD;
so when she was to be married to the barber's&#xD;
'prentice.&#xD;
'flow,' several voices asked, 'because she&#xD;
was in love?'&#xD;
~To be suie;and then Shehad 'a new silk&#xD;
besides-green, sea green, with red stripes-&#xD;
Oh, she was so happy!&#xD;
And with this declaration of the abounding&#xD;
cause of felicity to his landlady's daughter,&#xD;
the young gentleman devoted himself with&#xD;
great seriousness to his breakfast. As they&#xD;
were leaving the room a~ few moment's after,&#xD;

He looked at her a moment as- if uneerlalt&#xD;
of his ground, and then said:&#xD;
'I intend to ask Marcia Berkeley to be my&#xD;

'Oh' Gabriel,' she said, 'I am so glad I I&#xD;

really do love her? Forgive me~ for: ever&#xD;

'I did not say I loved her.' She loved me:&#xD;

She would have gone on in her enthu~iaew&#xD;

from a ~irimson hood was seen; and soon to-&#xD;
wards the Cedar alley tripped a tall, graceful&#xD;
figure, enveloped~in a grey blanket shawl. As&#xD;
she reached the entrance the young girl looked&#xD;
eagerly up and down, but no one was to be&#xD;

commenced walking briskly up and down, ever&#xD;

CHAPTER VII,&#xD;
rjY~e few days following Christmas were fill-&#xD;

N~w Year's Eve. Robert had passed his&#xD;

'Put the candles down, Nellie, and arrange&#xD;
Miss Lydia's toilet.' Elizabeth said to the maid;&#xD;
and as the door of the blue chamber closed,&#xD;
she too bent her head and wept in sympathy.&#xD;
The spring-shower woe e~r and Lydia raised&#xD;
her dewy face.&#xD;
'Lily,' she said, taking Elizabetlfs hand and&#xD;
~ dressing it closely to her heart, 'I cannot stay.&#xD;
o not let Annie ask me. I must go to main-&#xD;
ma-to my own sweet, quiet borne. Oh, Lily,&#xD;
my heart will break if I stay I'&#xD;
She covered her face again,, nor looked up&#xD;
for some moments. Evidently she was much&#xD;
distressed.&#xD;
'You know I love him,' she continued after&#xD;
a while. 'You know I love Alfred with my&#xD;
whole heart and soul-God keep mc from by-&#xD;

eyes to Heaven. 'Lily, I love him, and yet-&#xD;
and yet I do not think I will ever marry him.'&#xD;
'Do not say so, darling. 'Ji'i~ust in God, and&#xD;
do not give way to such unfounded presenti-&#xD;
rneiits.'&#xD;
Not unfounded, Lily; I mean I cannot&#xD;
marry him. I could not, oh, I could not mar-&#xD;

Elizabeth started, and exclaimed:&#xD;
'A gambler! Oh, Lydia, you must be mis-&#xD;
'taken. Wh~ has told you this foul scandal?'&#xD;
'He himself.' She spoke it calmly and de-&#xD;
liberately. He told me laughingl~'-ah, littic&#xD;
did h~ know how my heart bled for every gush&#xD;
of merriment-how he had been among the&#xD;
wildest set in College, and been drawn into all&#xD;
their excesses. He saw I looked gravely and'&#xD;
begged my pardon; but, Lily, the pardon w~is&#xD;
not of me, as I told. him, but of God. This&#xD;
happened on Monday. Tuesday he went with&#xD;
his brother Gabriel to Grofton ; and since them&#xD;
he has been so different, so abstracted and&#xD;
cold; would you believe it, Lily, he spoke al-&#xD;
most harshly?'&#xD;
It WftS of no use to try and comfort her, or&#xD;
to. persuade her that Alfred was ,young and&#xD;
thoughtless. She wouhl eee no eicuss f~&#xD;
wickedness; she had been taught to avoid 'aN&#xD;
appearance of evil.' Nellie came back to U-&#xD;

were so well dispersed through the ro6nis that&#xD;

hung with colored lamps, almost hidden amidst&#xD;

with promenaders.&#xD;
But Marcia Berkeley was reine do la nuit&#xD;

a little behind one of the dower stands watch-&#xD;

ou this prize before he proclaimed his fortu-&#xD;

some one tapped him on the shoulder. It was&#xD;
the old intruder, his creditor'.&#xD;
'Surprised to see me here to-night, eb, Mr.&#xD;
Gabriel?' the old man began; 'well, you see,&#xD;
nobody ever slights me; no sir,' he chuckled,&#xD;
'old Jimmie Ellis cant be slighted.'&#xD;
'You are forts~natc, sir,' Gabm~el said sarcas-&#xD;
tically, 'few of us can boast of being such fa-&#xD;
vorites with the world.'&#xD;
'Come, don'#~ let us be~ scornful, Mr. Gabriel;&#xD;

those inexpressible repulsive winks he Waa&#xD;

For a few moment Gabriel stood still, stun-&#xD;

It was about a month aften the ftital tragedy&#xD;
that Mr. Rivers rode over to see his son as was&#xD;
his practice daily, leaving Alfred at R.ivorlands&#xD;
asthe sole occupant. Poor boy, he very sel-&#xD;
dorn went into Gabriel's sick chamber except&#xD;
wI~en the invalid was asleep or unconscious,&#xD;
for there was such an evident dislike to his&#xD;
presence evinced b~' his brother that both up-&#xD;
pearod indeed miserable when he~wae present.&#xD;
Mr. Rivers alighted from his horse, and stood&#xD;
for a few moments looking around upon the&#xD;
'winter landscape. Elizabeth descended the&#xD;
steps to meet her guardian, and. as she gave&#xD;
him her hand and mentioned Gabriel's Im-&#xD;
provement during the day, ho stooped and&#xD;
kis~med her with more than usual affection.&#xD;
He turned ~.s they went up .the steps together,&#xD;
and looked towards the little enclobure where&#xD;
he willows leaned mournfully over two green&#xD;
mounds.&#xD;
* -          'Poor William and his wife!' he said, as if&#xD;

curse.&#xD;
Elizabeth lool~ed up Inquiringly.&#xD;
'Insanity is an inheritance in the family of&#xD;
the 'Burtons,' he said and then drew her in..&#xD;
The invalid's room was darkened when Elis..&#xD;
m~e5h and her guardian entered. Gabriel was&#xD;
dozing, but he evidently recognized the foot&#xD;
steps, and rai~ing his hand he took that of his&#xD;
~ ~isin in his own.&#xD;
'You are very good to me, Lily,' ho said&#xD;
sit here beside rue, and you, papa. I feel bet-&#xD;
ten- to-night.'&#xD;
The musical voice was all that remained of&#xD;
the former Gabriel Rivers. Elizabeth drew a&#xD;
~tair near for the father and sitting down on&#xD;
a lounge close beside the bed still retained the&#xD;
wsated hand.&#xD;
'I will never see again, ~4ly,' wei~e the~flrst&#xD;
words that broke the silence as the young man&#xD;
turned his sightless orbs toward her whom ho&#xD;
addressed. 'I cannot see how horribly dlallg-&#xD;
ured I am. WellI suppose it Is as well.&#xD;
T)iere must be vory little left of handsome&#xD;
4hbriel Rivers.'&#xD;
He laughed as ~me spoke, a low, short langh,&#xD;
which grated painfully on the ears of his list-&#xD;
easre, audwenton In the same tone:&#xD;
'I really never fancied Marcia loved me so&#xD;
well. A hard case, truly, to be shot because&#xD;

I was very seldom unconscious.'&#xD;
How strangely he taThed! Mr. llivers look-&#xD;
ed at Elizabeth, but her face was turned away.&#xD;
The old man leaned over, and smoothed tke&#xD;
bright hair from his darling's disfigured brow,&#xD;
while a shadow of pain passed over his face.&#xD;
'Had you not better take a little of this&#xD;
medicine, my son, and then try and sleep.&#xD;
You are nervous.&#xD;
'A little of what ~' he asked.&#xD;
'This morphine. It will quid you.'&#xD;
'Where is it?'&#xD;
'Here in this vial.'&#xD;

The father placed it in his hand.&#xD;
'Very well. I will take ~'oiue directly.&#xD;
Don't trouble yourself to replace it~ I will&#xD;
put it here.'&#xD;
He forced the cork in well, a-nd laid it iia-.&#xD;
(leT his pillow. Mr. Rivers s~ruely' notbood&#xD;
him, but gazed abstracte'lly into the fire. The&#xD;
sick man talked on a little longer in the same&#xD;
strange, unfeeling manner, tizid the poor fath-&#xD;
er was greatly relieved when the physio~a'&#xD;
was announced.&#xD;
About ten o'uloek Mr. Rivers went up stairs&#xD;
to the room prepared for him, as he usually is-&#xD;
inained overnight. Gabriel had appuiared toe&#xD;
some time dozing or in deep thought, so the&#xD;
old man went out softly, only stepping up t&#xD;
the bed before he lcft. to look once more&#xD;
that idolized face. The door scarcely cloe~it&#xD;
when Gabriel raised his heed as if to look&#xD;
around, forgetful he would n~ver see again.&#xD;
As the recollection occurred to him he fcfl&#xD;
back and groaned self in anguish. Elisebeth&#xD;
came forward and spoke to him. -&#xD;
'Do not tell me of resignation,' he 4d,&#xD;
hoarsely. 'I'll have none of It4 Cant 11W.&#xD;

'those careless, mool~ing lips, in tones of utter&#xD;
indifference! ~Iis QWn short-comings--except&#xD;
those Intimately connected with his brother-&#xD;
were 'not mentioned; the Orofton Mills and&#xD;
his strange and Illegal connection with them&#xD;
wore riot, alluded to, even distantly.&#xD;
'That Is all, (i&amp;amp;brlel?' Elizabeth said, when'&#xD;
he had finished. She had little pity for him&#xD;
now&#xD;
'Yes, that is alL Ill sleep pretty well now,&#xD;
the thing Is off my conscience. I believe in&#xD;
t1~e Confeesl mal.-a regular Catholic, eh, Lily?&#xD;
I suspect there would be many more If such&#xD;
father-confessors could be provided.'&#xD;
She was going outi to escape this heartless&#xD;
mirth, but GabrIel called her back.&#xD;
' Yon are going to cry, I know. You we-&#xD;
.rnen, kind-hearted, winless souls, always do.&#xD;
AO for me I never have shed a tear, and It is&#xD;
too late now. Don't forget while you are&#xD;

'I, Gabriel! she exclaimed.&#xD;
You ;' he replied. 'If you had not spo-&#xD;
ken so contemptuously when I offered you my&#xD;
love I never would have been here.'&#xD;
She stepped eagerly to his side and spoke a&#xD;
few quick, deprecating words, but he stopped&#xD;
her impatiently.&#xD;
D~ not talk to me now: I t~annot bear It.&#xD;
Ilotum in an hour and I will listen if I am&#xD;
awake. If Isleep, do trot disturb me.'&#xD;
Ho took her hand and held it a few me-&#xD;
inents and whispered as she turned away:&#xD;
'Think lightly of my sins, Lily, or you may&#xD;
reproach yourself.'&#xD;
She left the room and crossed the hall.&#xD;
Elias stood In the Library d9or, and within,&#xD;
Miss Berkeley, with her bonnet aird shawl on&#xD;
anda small basket in her hand.&#xD;
'Are you going out?' Elizabeth asked.&#xD;
'Mi-u. Ward is much worse, and we are go-&#xD;
ing to her,' was answered. 'Will you watch&#xD;
with Gabriel till we return?'&#xD;
Ell~abeth promised, and as Miss Berkeley&#xD;
left the apartment by suother door, reminded&#xD;
Bliss of her Intentions In regard to the young&#xD;
girl, Mathalla. He made no reply, but simply&#xD;
turned back i~nd looked full into her honest&#xD;
blueeyee. Tbeua~IfsatIsfled with the scru-&#xD;
tiny, went her away.&#xD;
The hoifr ~hIc~r Gabriel bogged might&#xD;
&#xD;
elapse before she returned to the sick cham~r,&#xD;
V~llsabeth passed, pacing the library floor.&#xD;
The lateness of the hour-the ghostly stlllxiws&#xD;
of the house-the droadfull associations con-&#xD;
nected with that room-all conspired to ebill&#xD;
even a brMrer heart than Elizabeth's, ro-&#xD;
preached as she now was' by the last words&#xD;
Gabriel had addressed her. A month had&#xD;
passed since that terrible night, but she had&#xD;
never before entered this room. Why, not&#xD;
even bet own heart could have told, except&#xD;
that she feared to encounter face to face the&#xD;
sin of Gabriel Rivers. Now, In the flickering&#xD;
firelight she seemed to see it all ; ~the broken&#xD;
'links of many circumstances joined themselves&#xD;
and the tragedy was enacted before her. Her&#xD;
own words, spoken with such contempt; the&#xD;
last glance she took of the deceiver standing&#xD;
there so perfect In form and features, 85 she&#xD;
walked proudly through the door; then the&#xD;
sad echoes of his horse's hoofs as he galloped&#xD;
away forever, ah, perhaps forever from his.&#xD;
home. She saw him enter Into Marcia's pres-&#xD;
once flushed and excited-she heard the mag-&#xD;
ical, flute-like voice tell Its burden of deceit---&#xD;
the response of the poor, half-crazed glr~-&#xD;
his mocking laugh, the click of the pistol, and&#xD;
-and-Hush I was that a step? She raised&#xD;
her eyes distended with the vivid coloring of&#xD;
the awful 'picture in her Imagination, and&#xD;
there-yes just there, where a few crimson&#xD;
spots had spotted the peach-tinged wall and&#xD;
refused to be effaced-just there stood a pals,&#xD;
phantom-like form. One, two, three long&#xD;
gasping breaths, the paralyzed girl drew as she&#xD;
gazed, her Stel)5 seemed rooted to the ~I~Otr-&#xD;
then a low, rippling laugh curdled her very&#xD;
blood, and she fell heavily to the floor I&#xD;
How long she lay there Elizabeth never&#xD;
knew ; when she remembered hor~elf ~he w~u&#xD;
still lying where she had fallen. The fire had&#xD;
burnt ont, and a cold winter moon shone in at&#xD;
the window. Rising hastily with a shud49r~&#xD;
she made her w~y to the door and theiwe tq&#xD;
the sick-room. She entered softly and lit&#xD;
the taper. The bed curtains were drawn, and,&#xD;
as all was still, she did not approach to wake&#xD;
the sleeper. Sitting down In the arm-chair&#xD;
which stood where Mr. 'Rivers had gently&#xD;
pushed it back, she folded her hands and gazed&#xD;
vacantly Into the dying embers. She recalled&#xD;
the events of the last few hours, and though&#xD;
satisfied the vision was but the effect of her&#xD;
own excited imagination, she could not divest&#xD;
herself of the horror which had taken bold&#xD;
upon her. Although far from affecting the&#xD;
nervous, hysterical woman, Elizabeth's organ-&#xD;
ization was high.strung, not easily excited,&#xD;
but capable of being worked upon to a degree&#xD;
few weaker minds could have endured. With-&#xD;
out a shadow of superstition, she feared the&#xD;

c~n the common sympathy of a stranger, but&#xD;
walked up to Ehias as he returned from assists.&#xD;
ing his sister into the house, and told him his&#xD;
business in a few words.'&#xD;
'You have chosen a strange6 time for your&#xD;
communication, Mr. Ellis,' 'I~lias said sternly.&#xD;
'Business is business, 'Mr. Elias,"the old&#xD;
man answered with a sneer, 'and business must&#xD;
be attended to. I knew of this thing ever&#xD;
since the old gentleman was taken so ill, and&#xD;
you see I would not trouble you all till he was&#xD;

Mr. Ellis smiled scornfully.&#xD;

those calm, dewy days when Nature seems to&#xD;
pray upon the distant hill-tops, and mist lint-&#xD;

~turns from communion with the Father. Over&#xD;

expected. On the following &amp;amp;Lbbath, Elim-&#xD;

of Windway; and when he remembered the&#xD;
cad event which had prevented his own com-&#xD;

nity seemed one providentially sent that Ii.&#xD;
might not again be disappointed. Two days&#xD;
were to elapse before, and these were epeot&#xD;
I quietly in preparation. Alfred was gro'vh~g&#xD;

,True, they had not many schools, and&#xD;

yet; in what schools and courts they&#xD;
did have, theje were many things,&#xD;
which, when men thought upon theni&#xD;
&#xD;
at all, they thought might-as well have&#xD;
been done differently, or left undone.&#xD;
The schools had ways of righting them-&#xD;
*{~lves. The things done in them,&#xD;
though seriously iuconvenieimt at the&#xD;

* shabby, for a habit he had of chewing&#xD;
tolAcco all the time when he was not&#xD;
eating or asleep, and spitting on him-&#xD;

* Mr. Sandidge had, as it seemed, an am-&#xD;
bition to appear perfectly and univer-&#xD;
sally agreeable, His countenance,&#xD;
* when he looked at, another, was invari-&#xD;
ably clothed in smiles. He never&#xD;
'laughed, he only smiled, While n~-&#xD;
ture had given him no very acu're sense&#xD;
of the humorous, and while, therefore,&#xD;
he never felt like laughing, ho had, ap-&#xD;
parently, from a sense of duty, learned&#xD;
to smile, and he smiled at every thing'~&#xD;
If one said 'good mornining' to him, he&#xD;
was sure to smile as he returned the&#xD;
salutation. If one, in answer to an in-&#xD;
quiry concerning his health, complain-&#xD;
ed of a headache, lie smiled the most&#xD;
cordial sympathy. There was no con-&#xD;
siderable amount of cheer convoyed ~&#xD;
his smiles-no more than tHere was by&#xD;

got used to them. But whoever said&#xD;
anything funny where he and others&#xD;
were present, and no person laughed&#xD;
