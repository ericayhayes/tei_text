               <p>It was bleak December, five-and-twenty years ago. There was slushy, frozen mud in
                  the streets, and flying snow in the air—which last, borne by the strong, eddying
                  winds, flurried into the faces of the few who were abroad at that midnight hour,
                  or driving up the lanes and alleys, formed white drifts, like barriers, across
                  them. The watchmen, closely muffled in their many-caped overcoats, sought shelter
                  under the lee of projecting stoops, grocery-sheds, etc., secure on such a stormy
                  night from the oversight of their official superiors, who then, as now, made
                     <emph>duty</emph> a secondary matter to <emph>comfort</emph>. For few who were
                  tax-payers, none who could avoid it, would take such a night for a promenade; and
                  if they did, would not be likely to be out hunting up official delinquency.</p>
               <p>Along the piers of each of the great rivers which environ Manhattan Island, the
                  icy waves dashed and raged noisily, for both wind and tide were high. And upon one
                  of these piers stood a watchman who, for a wonder, was wide awake. He was wrapped
                  in his large coat, and as he leaned against the lamp-post on the pier, its faint
                  and flickering light revealed a full, florid, and honest countenance—one which
                  seemed to have been touched by the finger of true humanity. He seemed to be rather
                  past the middle age, but stout, well-built, and hardy.</p>
               <p>At times he would look out upon the dark and angry waters, though it was too hard
                  a night for the operations of the river-thieves. Then he would cast his glance
                  amid the forest of masts and spars, and upon the dark hulls, close at hand, and
                  from thence up toward the city, and along the dim line of lights which marked the
                  streets. But no one seemed to be abroad, and an occasional yawn told that his was
                  sleepy work. When the strong wind came in a gust of unusual bitterness, and blew
                  the sleety snow in his face, he would draw the muffler closer around his neck; and
                  turning his broad back to the blast, hum or whistle a careless tune, as if he
                  scorned its power.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, however, the apathy with which he met the assaults of the storm
                  departed, and with an exclamation of surprise, he looked up the pier at something
                  very strange, which seemed to be reeling down toward him. It seemed to walk like a
                  human being; but if it was, it was dressed strangely for a winter night, for it
                  was robed in white.</p>
               <p>"I don't believe in ghosts!" said the watchman, as a shudder passed over his huge
                  frame. "If I did, I'd say that 'ere is one, by hokee!"</p>
               <p>The figure came nearer still, and the watchman saw the pale face of a woman,
                  young, very beautiful, with great, wild black eyes, and hair streaming in tangled
                  tresses from her uncovered head down upon white shoulders that had not even a
                  shawl to shield them from the merciless storm.</p>
               <p>"Where are you going?" he cried, as he left the lamp-post, and with a single step
                  stood in front of her.</p>
               <p>"To death—to death—hinder me not!" she said, in a tone so low, so deep, that it
                  thrilled away down into the old watchman's strong heart like the toll of a
                  funeral-bell.</p>
               <p>And she raised a white, round arm, and with a hand which sparkled with jeweled
                  rings in that dim lamp-light, she motioned for him to stand aside. But with gentle
                  strength he took the small, white hand in his, which, with its thick mitten,
                  looked like the hand of a giant, and said:</p>
               <p>"Lady, you are too young to die, and much too beautiful and delicate to be out in
                  this terrible storm with only your thin night-dress on. You have been in some
                  dream, or else some great wrong has been done!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, a great wrong—a great wrong—but, oh! it was not a <emph>dream</emph>—it was
                  not a <emph>dream!</emph> My father called me a terrible name, and bade me go
                  forth and hide my shame from him and all the world! In death only can it be
                  hidden—let me go, let me go! The spirit of the dark waters is calling for me—let
                  me go!"</p>
               <p>And she tried to break from the grasp of the good old watchman, but he saw that
                  her mind was astray, and tenderly, but with firmness, he restrained her.</p>
               <p>"Lady," said he, "you must go home with me. It is but a poor home for one who
                     has<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6962-00000003"/> been used to luxury, but I have
                  there a good wife, who will nurse you as tenderly as a mother."</p>
               <p>"A <emph>mother!</emph> My mother is dead and in heaven—oh! let me go to her!"
                  said the poor lady, mournfully.</p>
               <p>"Not till the good Lord wills it, lady," said the old watchman, as he took off his
                  muffler and put it upon her head, and doffed his large watch-coat, which he
                  wrapped carefully about her slender form.</p>
               <p>"Now, come with me," he said, kindly. And supporting her with his strong arm, he
                  led her away, for she was almost insensible, and did not resist any more.</p>
               <p>He went on, almost carrying her, for she seemed to grow weaker at every step,
                  until he came to a row of poor frame tenements, west of Broadway, and not far from
                  the Park—where now immense stores filled with goods are standing—up the steps of
                  one of which he ascended, and knocked at the door with his stout mace.</p>
               <p>A window overhead was opened, and the voice of a woman asked who was there.</p>
               <p>"It's me, Betsy—hurry down and open the door. I have a poor lady here who'll need
                  all your care to keep the life in her. Be quick! she is in a faint now," said the
                  watchman, who felt that her whole weight was now on his arm.</p>
               <p>Not a minute had elapsed before the door opened, and an elderly woman, with a
                  shawl only thrown on over her night-garments, and a face which was a map of
                  benevolence and kindness, appeared with a candle in her hand.</p>
               <p>"Why, Jonathan, is this you? What is the matter?" said she.</p>
               <p>"Don't ask a question, Betsy, till we get this poor lady into the spare bed, and
                  do something to fetch her to. I'm afraid she has well-nigh perished in this
                  storm!"</p>
               <p>"And you, too, without your great-coat, Jonathan," said Betsy, as she lighted him
                  up a pair of narrow, rickety stairs after closing the front door, he carrying the
                  insensible lady as if she were no more weighty than a child.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>We must go back to the night previous to that described in the preceding chapter,
                  to look upon a scene which is a link in our chain of mystery.</p>
               <p>In a gorgeous saloon-parlor in the second story of a house at the corner of Duane
                  street and Broadway, a very select party of "nice young men" were
                     <emph>liquidating</emph> the debt they owed to Time with sundry bottles of
                  champagne. Wreathes of vapory smoke rose cloudily from their Habañas, and they
                  seemed to be enjoying themselves as much as those who have no thought of the past
                  or future—nothing beyond the present—can.</p>
               <p>Although there were a dozen young men, and some half-dozen gaudily, but not
                  modestly dressed females in the room, we have only two to describe particularly to
                  you—for they only are specially connected with this story.</p>
               <p>One was a splendidly formed young man, whose age might be five-and-twenty years,
                  not more. He had a dark but clear olive complexion—a flashing black eye—a haughty
                  expression sat upon his fine features. Long, curling black hair was brushed
                  carelessly back from a high forehead, and fell in glossy masses down about his
                  finely-molded neck, and upon his broad shoulders. By his dress, elegant in make
                  and costly in material—one could see that he was a seafaring man, his collar
                  loosely twined over a knotted cravat of black silk—a frock-coat with
                  anchor-buttons and slashed sleeves—wide trowsers fitting over a small and
                  faultless boot, being among the distinguishing marks. A bold and careless air
                  indicated, too, that he was of a rank which acknowledged no superiors.</p>
               <p>The other person alluded to was about the age of him whom we have just described,
                  also elegantly and fashionably dressed, but very evidently a landsman.</p>
               <p>His countenance, although not uncomely, expressed as legibly as the Almighty's
                  hand could write it, a treacherous, cowardly disposition—artful, designing,
                  hypocritical.</p>
               <p>"Here's a health to Captain Gerald Andros, and success to trade, whether it be in
                     blackbirds<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>
                     or laces and silks," cried the person last described.</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_001">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_001">*</ref>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Blackbirds—A term for negroes used in the slave-trade.</p>
               </note>
               <p>"A health to gallant Captain Andros," was echoed from lip to lip; and tinkling
                  glasses made silvery accompaniment to the toast.</p>
               <p>"Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you. In return, let me pledge Harry Corryell, the
                  son of the sharpest and wealthiest merchant in town," cried our dark-eyed nautical
                  friend, who had been toasted as Gerald Andros.</p>
               <p>"Only a step-son—a <emph>step-son</emph>, my dear Gerald," said him whom we
                  described next to Andros. And then he added: "I pledge you all in a bumper, ladies
                  and gentlemen."</p>
               <p>Again, glasses clashed and were emptied. And thus for hours the revel went on,
                  until nearly all of the company had set all the sail, "spiritually speaking,"
                  which they could carry, and had begun to drop off.</p>
               <p>But Andros, who evidently felt what he had taken, was still plied with fresh
                  potations by young Corryell, who did not seem to be affected by the wine at all.
                  In truth, this was not strange; for he had drank but very little—having covertly
                  thrown away his wine at almost every bout of the bottle.</p>
               <p>At last, every one dropped away from the parlor, except a few who were snoozing on
                  sofas, too heavy in the head for safe navigation; but the two whom we have noticed
                  so particularly remained.</p>
               <p>Corryell, who evidently had an object in so doing, insisted on emptying another
                  bottle of wine after they were left alone.</p>
               <p>"I must be aboard the Racer before morning, for I go to sea with the ebb-tide,"
                  said Andros.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you'll have plenty of time," replied the other. "By-the-way, does my fair
                  stepsister know that you are about to take another cruise?"</p>
               <p>Andros started, and a shadow crossed his brow and a sigh broke from his bosom
                  before he spoke. Then he replied:</p>
               <p>"No; I dislike formal partings. I will leave a note before I sail for her."</p>
               <p>"You received one from her to-day, didn't you? I saw her writing, and supposed it
                  was to you."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Andros. And again an expression of pain convulsed his features.</p>
               <p>"You must make a heavy profit for my good step-father in your trips?" said
                  Corryell again. "He seems to think a deal of you; and he always thinks most of
                  those who are the most profitable to him."</p>
               <p>Andros made no reply; for, since he had taken his last glass of wine, a stupor
                  seemed suddenly to have come upon him, and he sank into a sleep.</p>
               <p>"All right now, I reckon!" said Corryell, as, after shaking him and speaking to
                  him, he failed to arouse him. He then felt in his breast-pocket, and took from it
                  a letter which had been unsealed.</p>
               <p>Opening this, he perused it, and a fiendish smile of triumph flitted over his pale
                  face as he read. It was written in a female hand; but blots were plenty upon it,
                  as if the writer had been weeping while she perused its contents.</p>
               <p>"So things have gone so far!—she prays him to marry her at once, to save her from
                  inevitable exposure and disgrace!" muttered Corryell. "My mother will almost dance
                  for joy when she puts her hand on this letter; for the old man is as particular
                  about his <emph>honor</emph> as he is with his money. He will send the proud minx
                  adrift; and if I do not <emph>then</emph> become his heir, neither my mother nor
                  myself are much at manœuvring!"</p>
               <p>Placing the letter in his pocket, the young man left the room with a stealthy
                  step.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>It was near noon of the day following the night last spoken of in the second
                  chapter.</p>
               <p>Although a heavy storm was brewing, a beautiful clipper bark was being got
                  underway from her moorings off the Battery. But few persons were upon that then
                  sacred, but now speculation-desecrated spot, to witness the departure of the
                  vessel. But a group of sailors, who had been admiring her low, sharp, and
                  splendidly-modeled hull, her taut, heavy, and raking spars, were leaning over the
                  railing of the parapet, making their critical remarks, and watching the manner in
                  which the "full-handed" crew of the vessel went to work.</p>
               <p>"If she isn't a beauty, one never swam in blue water!" said one.</p>
               <p>"Ay!" added another. "Uncle Sam has ne'er a craft—not even 'Old Ironsides'—that
                  could haul alongside of her on a wind or going free!"</p>
               <p>"She looks snakish," said a third. "If she isn't off for the 'Coast,' there'll be
                  free-trade for her in any port she enters!"</p>
               <p>"Her cable is short. There go the boys aloft to loose the canvas!" said a
                  fourth.</p>
               <p>And, as he spoke, twenty or more active men sprang up the black and neatly-fitted
                  rigging, "laid out" upon the topsail and topgallant yards; and, casting loose the
                  gaskets, let the snowy canvas fall loosely in the buntlines and clewlines, ready
                  for "sheeting home."</p>
               <p>Then they hurried to the deck again; the sails were sheeted home, the head-yards
                  trimmed aback, and the main sharp up; then with a cheer the capstan flew around
                  again, and in a short time the anchor was speak, groundhold broken; and then, long
                  before it reached the bows to be "fished and catted," the vessel veered away
                  before the wind, the yards were rounded in, the head-sails hoisted and trimmed,
                  and the Racer, as her name on the stern signified, moved rapidly down the smooth
                  waters of our large and lovely bay.</p>
               <p>Then an old gentleman who had stood near the group of sailors, wrapped in a warm
                  cloak, watching the movements of the vessel with apparent interest, took a white
                  handkerchief from his pocket, and waved it as if for a parting signal. At the same
                  time, the young man whom we have introduced to the reader as Gerald Andros, sprang
                  upon the taffrail of the bark and waved his cap; while from a bowport of the
                  vessel a single gun boomed forth its parting thunder.</p>
               <p>"I reckon that's the owner," said one of the oldest of the group of sailors, as he
                  observed the movements of the elderly gentleman, who now turned, and, walking to a
                  carriage which waited outside of the Battery grounds, entered it, and was driven
                  off.</p>
               <p>"Likely, yes," said another. "None but owners, and sich like, can drive such a
                  natty craft as that he scuds up-town with."</p>
               <p>The men now looked for a few moments upon the rapidly receding vessel; and then,
                  upon the suggestion being made to "freshen the nip," started for a favorite port
                  near at hand—the sign of "The Jolly Sailor"—with a fair prospect of "grog"
                  ahead.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>It was the night of the same day; and the storm which had been "brewing" all the
                  day—ay, and for days previous—had burst forth in its tempestuous strength of wind,
                  and sleet,<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6962-00000004"/> and <unclear>driving</unclear>
                  snow. It was a terrible night for houseless and homeless ones. And how many there
                  ever are in the great city! How many such lie down and perish beneath the shadows
                  of the tall-spired churches, wherein well-clad, wealthy <emph>Christians</emph>
                  gather weekly to hear sermons upon charity to the suffering heathen—to weep over
                  the lack of bibles and woolen blankets in Africa—to regret that their sleek and
                  well-fatted pastor has to labor so hard as to write and read two sermons a week
                  for the miserable salary of ten thousand dollars a year!</p>
               <p>It was a fearful night for those "horrid vulgar sailors"—those outcasts who do not
                  need missionaries or warm blankets, but plenty of abuse off land and on shore,
                  though their rough hands roll up the bales of commercial wealth upon our shores—a
                  fearful night for them upon our coast.</p>
               <p>The stiff north-east gale drives in upon the rock-bound shore; the mad Atlantic
                  heaves its monster waves, spotted with great flecks of angry foam in toward the
                  land; while the ships, with groaning hulls, straining spars, rigging cased in ice,
                  and sails as stiff as oaken planks, battle like half-crippled giants against the
                  force which sweeps them down toward destruction on their lee. And the poor,
                  half-frozen sailors, 'numbed and perishing, struggle more bravely than the heroes
                  of a battlefield. Struggle for what? Scanty pay and plenty of abuse on
                  board—robbery, wrong, and more abuse when they reach the shore.</p>
               <p>But all this, though it will well up from the bottom of a heart which
                     <emph>knows</emph> their wrongs, and hates the <emph>Pharisees</emph> of the
                  great city, is not a link in our story.</p>
               <p>Fearful as the night was, Madame—or Mrs. I might as well call her—Mariana
                  Mildollar, once the widow Corryell, but now the wife of a merchant-prince, had no
                  care for it; for, with her precious scheming villain of a son, she was seated in
                  the warm, magnificent sitting-room of her husband's palatial residence. True, she
                  could hear the wail and the shriek of the storm outside; but had a thousand
                  wretches been perishing in their rags there, her cold, selfish, haughty heart
                  would have been as deaf to their cries as it was to the gale.</p>
               <p>"I wonder what keeps the old man down town so late? It is after eleven o'clock,"
                  said young Corryell, as he looked at his superb watch. "I wish he'd come—ah,
                  there's his step—talk of Satan and he's always on hand!"</p>
               <p>The door opened and Richard Mildollar, the same old gentleman at whom we have
                  taken a passing glance, as upon the Battery he waved an adieu to the Racer,
                  entered the room.</p>
               <p>You could read his character at a glance—that is, if you have been a student of
                  character, as it is expressed in the human countenance.</p>
               <p>His face was as cold and passionless as marble, every lineament indicating a stern
                  and inflexible will—nothing but a keen, quick-glancing grey eye, indicated that
                  beneath the ice of his apparent nature rushed a Niagara of passion, if it was once
                  let loose. His step was slow and deliberate, and his manner that of one who
                  treads, not upon a foundation of sand, but one of gold.</p>
               <p>"You are late, dear husband!" said Mrs. Mildollar—who, for a woman of forty, was
                  very good-looking indeed, and possessed also a very "winning way."</p>
               <p>"Yes; been very much occupied," he replied, quietly, as he drew a chair up close
                  before the glowing fire.</p>
               <p>"Harry and myself have been waiting anxiously to see you," said Mrs.
                  Mildollar.</p>
               <p>"Why more so than usual? I do not know that I have hitherto marked any very
                  special anxiety about the hour of my return!" said the merchant millionaire; and
                  there was a slight tone of sarcasm in his voice.</p>
               <p>The lady sighed and looked very serious, and <emph>her</emph> son tried to do the
                  same thing; but his sigh was very short-winded, and his look about as serious as
                  that of a sick monkey contemplating an orange.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter?" asked the merchant, rather testily; for he, being a
                  plain-spoken man, who did not like any hesitation in matters which required
                  explanation, began to be impatient.</p>
               <p>"Can you tell me where Capt. Gerald Andros, your great favorite, is?" asked the
                  lady.</p>
               <p>"Yes; at sea with my best ship under him, and a lee shore to work off from in this
                  terrible gale! He insisted upon sailing to-day, and I was so foolish as to permit
                  it!" replied the merchant.</p>
               <p>"He had good reason to be in haste," said Mrs. Mildollar, in a tone full of
                  meaning.</p>
               <p>"Why? Speak, madam, if you have any thing to say which I ought to hear. You know
                  that I detest mystery."</p>
               <p>"I cannot tell you, my dear—I cannot tell you; for I think so much of poor,
                  unfortunate Adelia, that I can only weep for her!"</p>
               <p>And the lady put her perfumed handkerchief up to her eyes, and sobbed with
                  articulate precision.</p>
               <p>"Go on, madam! What of my daughter? Speak out at once!"</p>
               <p>"O Mr. Mildollar, do not speak so terribly! Read this letter which our poor,
                  faithful, brave Harry <emph>forced</emph> from the boasting seducer, who was in
                  such haste to flee from your presence before his villainy was discovered!"</p>
               <p>And the lady handed the merchant the letter which young Corryell had abstracted
                  from the pocket of Gerald Andros.</p>
               <p>The merchant took the letter and read its contents. At first, if possible, his
                  very pale face grew more white, and then black blood seemed to rush up in every
                  vein, for it grew dark as night. His frame quivered like a strong tree struck by a
                  fearful shock. At last he spoke—his voice low and husky, his looks terrible with
                  anger.</p>
               <p>"Leave this room, both of you! Madam, send my daughter to me
                     <emph>instantly</emph>—INSTANTLY!"</p>
               <p>"Let me implore of you, my dear husband, to deal gently with her. She is young,
                  and then Gerald was your favorite, and so handsome, and had such winning
                  ways!"</p>
               <p>"Madam, will you obey me!" said the merchant, in a tone so deep and low that she
                  trembled for herself, as his eye seemed to look her through.</p>
               <p>"I go," she said, faintly. "Come, Harry, my dear."</p>
               <p>The woman had achieved her first object. She had aroused the most fearful storm in
                  her husband's bosom that she had ever seen exhibited there. And she left the room,
                  followed by her aid and abettor in crime—for if it be not a <emph>crime</emph> to
                  arouse the passion of a father against his child, then there is no crime on
                  earth—no matter how much she may have erred.</p>
               <p>The merchant stood silent, still as a statue, watching with a terrible eye the
                  door by which his child would enter. In a few moments she came—came in her white
                  night-robes, looking very, <emph>very</emph> beautiful, and <emph>so</emph>
                  innocent!</p>
               <p>"<emph>Dear</emph> father, are you ill? They called me suddenly from my sleep, and
                  said that you wanted me!" she cried, as she hurried forward.</p>
               <p>"And you could <emph>sleep?</emph>" he asked, sternly.</p>
               <p>"Yes; I was sleeping, father. But why do you regard me with such a fearful look of
                  anger?"</p>
               <p>"Did you write that letter?" he replied, still in that deep, husky tone which she
                  had never heard from his lips before. And he tossed it to her scornfully.</p>
               <p>She recognized it without lifting it from the floor, and cast herself weeping at
                  his feet, and tried to cling to him.</p>
               <p>"Back, <emph>strumpet!</emph> touch me not!" he said, hoarsely. "You have brought
                  ruin upon yourself, and disgrace to my grey hairs!"</p>
               <p>"O my father, hear me! I have erred, dreadfully erred, yet hear me! Gerald—"</p>
               <p>"Is far away at sea, and you will never see his face again, vile girl!" said the
                  old man, sternly.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Gone?</emph> O God! He promised—he <emph>promised</emph>—"</p>
               <p>The poor girl could say no more, for sobs choked utterance. But her sorrow had no
                  influence upon his heart, now almost marble in his bitter passion.</p>
               <p>"Go from this house, vile strumpet!" he cried. "Go and hide your shame from me and
                  all the world!"</p>
               <p>She rose, so pale, so heart-broken in looks, and for a moment looked her father in
                  the face. Not one ray of mercy found she there. His icy eye was fixed upon her,
                  his finger without a tremor pointed to the door.</p>
               <p>With a moan of utter despair, thin clad as she was, Adelia tottered out of the
                  room, staggered down the spacious hall, opened the outer door, and bare as were
                  her ebon tresses, fled away amid the gloom and the pelting of the storm, with but
                  one word upon her lips:</p>
               <p>"Gerald! Gerald! Cruel Gerald!"</p>
               <p>The reader now knows who honest Jonathan Birdsall saved from the watery bed of the
                  suicide on the night which opened our story, and why she was there.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>It was the morning of another day. And the good watchman, who had returned to his
                  post after having aided his Betsy to place poor Adelia in bed, and succeeded in
                  recovering her from the swoon into which she had fallen, now came back to his
                  home—for the night-watch was over, and his time for rest had arrived; and right
                  glad was he, for the storm had increased in violence, and was now raging terribly.
                  But his little room was warm; and a pot of hot coffee was steaming upon the stove,
                  and Betsy was there with a kind and loving smile to greet him, and to take off his
                  muffler and overcoat, and shake the snow from them and his hat.</p>
               <p>"How is the poor, dear lady?" was the old man's first question.</p>
               <p>"She has cried herself to sleep!" said Betsy. And she is in a terrible hot fever,
                  and even in her sleep raves and talks about her father and some one that she calls
                  Gerald."</p>
               <p>"Poor child! she has suffered some grievous wrong!" said the old man. "We must do
                  the best we can for her. Had our own sweet Laura lived, she would have been about
                  this one's age."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and full as handsome, for all she had blue eyes," said Betsy.</p>
               <p>"You say that the poor creature is in a high fever?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Jonathan—terribly hot is it upon her!"</p>
               <p>"Then hasten, wife, and get me a bite of breakfast to keep the cold from out my
                  stomach—I must go and get a doctor for her!"</p>
               <p>"They charge terribly high, and we've so little money!" said the wife, with a
                  sigh, as she drew out a small table and put a white cloth upon it.</p>
               <p>"Betsy, while we have a cent, and the life of a fellow-creature is in danger, it
                  is our <emph>duty</emph> to expend it!" said Jonathan, almost sternly. And then he
                  seemed to feel that perhaps he had spoken too severely, or rather that his tone
                  had been harsh, and he said:</p>
               <p>"I know you are too good-hearted, my Betsy, to begrudge anything you have or can
                  do for a poor sick child like her."</p>
               <p>"You are right, Jonathan. God bless you, dear!" said the really warm-hearted
                     woman;<pb n="8-9 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6962-00000005"/> and she bent down
                  and kissed his cheek, which was yet numb and cold from exposure to the storm.
                  "I'll get you a bite ready in a minute or two, and then you can hurry off for the
                  doctor, and have him here in time to attend to her when she wakes."</p>
               <p>"All right, Betsy—you are a jewel of a woman!" said the old man; and he put on his
                  brass-mounted spectacles, and took down the old family-bible—to read, as usual,
                  his morning chapter.</p>
               <p>By the time that this was done, his breakfast was ready; and with a good appetite
                  and a clear conscience, he sat down to the frugal meal—not, however, partaking of
                  it until he had asked a blessing from the Giver of all good.</p>
               <p>As soon as he had finished, he again put on his overcoat, muffler, and hat, and
                  breasted the raging storm—going to find a doctor for the poor sufferer who rested
                  beneath his roof.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <p>There was a vessel, stripped of her taut and tapering upper-spars, with only her
                  scant but stout storm-staysails set, struggling in a tremendous seaway off that
                  well-known point of danger, Cape Hatteras. She was nicely stripped for the battle;
                  her yards were down and lashed on deck; preventer-stays aided the standing-rigging
                  to sustain her bending lowermasts; her boats and spars were all secured with true
                  seaman-like' care; but the gale was so wild and strong, that she could only be
                  laid to the wind—she could add no canvas to force her off from the dreaded reefs
                  and shoals, and the barren sands so close under her lee.</p>
               <p>Aft, watching the compass which was set in the binnacle before the double-manned
                  wheel, and looking very often in the gloom to the westward—for it was night—stood
                  the young captain of the strong and beautiful bark; and close by his side was his
                  mate—an older man than he—whose weather-beaten face looked quite as anxious and
                  less firm than his own.</p>
               <p>"This is a bad place for us in such a night, Captain Andros," said the mate. "By
                  my reckoning, we must be off Hatteras, or in the bight twixt that and Cape
                  Fear—which is just as bad."</p>
               <p>"Ay—worse, if worse can be!" said Gerald Andros, gloomily. "Keep a good watch.
                  Morton—I'm going below, to look at my charts again! I was a fool to leave pork in
                  such weather; but I <emph>couldn't</emph> stay!"</p>
               <p>The young officer now left the deck and went into his cabin, while the mate went
                  forward and examined the rigging, anchors, boats, etc., to see that nothing had
                  started or broken loose. The crew, clinging to the shrouds, rails, and
                  man-ropes—and, where they could, sheltering themselves from the cold wind and
                  blustering spray under the bulwarks—watched him, as be staggered, lantern in hand,
                  along the decks of the rolling and plunging vessel, as if they would ask, from the
                  expression of his face, what and how great their danger was.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, a wild cry was heard from the cabin, and the mate rushed aft and below;
                  for the cry had been so loud, that he heard it even above the wild tumult of wind
                  and waters.</p>
               <p>Gerald Andros lay upon the cabin-floor, insensible, when Morton reached him.</p>
               <p>"Quick, steward—water, brandy, wine—<emph>anything</emph>, SOMETHING to revive
                  him! He has fainted—what is the matter?" cried the mate, as he raised the
                  inanimate form of the captain and laid it upon a sofa.</p>
               <p>The steward brought water in an instant—some was dashed in Gerald's face, some
                  forced between his pale lips, and his collar thrown open.</p>
               <p>Slowly he recovered his consciousness, and looked wildly about him.</p>
               <p>"Where <emph>is</emph> she?" he asked, in a husky whisper, as he recognized
                  Morton.</p>
               <p>"Where is who? I have seen no one—there is no woman on board," replied the
                  wondering mate.</p>
               <p>"There <emph>is</emph>—there <emph>must</emph> be! I saw Adelia, all dressed in
                  white; and she had a babe in her arms, and she held it out to me, and said—oh, how
                  mournfully!—'Gerald, take our child—the child of shame.' Yes, I saw her; she was
                  pale, and robed for the grave!"</p>
               <p>"You have been dreaming, captain—it was only a fancy. Drive it from your mind!
                  Here, steward, bring the captain a glass of brandy!" cried the mate.</p>
               <p>But before the steward could comply with the order, a cry came from the deck—a
                  fearful and united shout from all of the terror-stricken crew.</p>
               <p>"Breakers ahead!" was the cry.</p>
               <p>"Breakers on the lee bow—breakers all around!" was shouted again.</p>
               <p>And then the mate sprang for the deck, followed by Gerald Andros, who had fully
                  recovered his consciousness in this instant of imminent danger.</p>
               <p>All was boiling, roaring, seething foam about them—the dread tumult of the wind
                  was but a whisper to the thunder of the waters. On, borne upon the crest of an
                  immense roller, the dark hull of the bark rode with lightning speed for an
                  instant; then, with a crash, which sent the splintered masts far away amid the
                  yeast of waters, the vessel struck upon the ragged rocks of the dreaded Diamond
                  Shoal. Again it rose—shivered and shattered, drove a little further, and again
                  came down upon the terrible rocks, never to rise again, but to part in scattered
                  fragments—to which the drowning crew, with trembling cries, sought in vain to
                  cling.</p>
               <p>Soon all was still but the triumphant voices of the destroying elements, and
                  scarce a speck of the vessel could be traced amid the white waters. Of all that
                  gallant crew, but <emph>one</emph> remained to tell the story of her fate—but
                     <emph>one</emph> of<figure>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>It was night again, and the good old watchman, who had been excused from duty by
                  his superior for that one evening, sat in the same room where we last saw him in
                  the act of eating his breakfast.</p>
               <p>There was a murmur of voices in the next room, where the "spare bed" was located;
                  and, once in a while, the low wail of a newborn child, which seemed to grieve for
                  its entrance into a world so wild and cheerless, so cold and bitter as this
                  is.</p>
               <p>In a little while, a very genteel and energetic looking man entered the room.</p>
               <p>"How is your patient, doctor?" asked the watchman.</p>
               <p>"Very low, Mr. Birdsall, very low. There is but little chance of her recovery;
                  though she is no longer delirious, and now clings to her babe with a wild
                  affection which it is painful to behold, when we think how soon she may be torn
                  from it by the hands of death!"</p>
               <p>"Oh! it is hard to think of," said Birdsall. "Do all that you can for her, doctor.
                  I have not much money, but every cent I have shall go for her."</p>
               <p>"Not to me, my good man. I have heard her story, and know her family; and if I
                  wished to be paid for what I am doing, I would call upon them. As it is, you have
                  acted nobly, and done far more than many a wealthy man would!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, doctor, I have only performed a Christian's duty—no more. But I do hope the
                  poor lady will live. Betsy is a capital nurse. When I was so nigh killed by
                  burglars, a year ago, her care did more to save my life than anything else, I do
                  believe."</p>
               <p>"The chances are all against her. Her heart is well-nigh broken; and the exposure,
                  in her condition, to so terrible a storm, was more than her constitution could
                  bear. But I have calls elsewhere. If she gets worse, send for me instantly.
                  Meantime, I shall see her father, and try to influence him to take her back to his
                  home—for she is the only child left to him by his dead wife, whom I once knew
                  well."</p>
               <p>The physician now resumed his hat and cloak, and went out.</p>
               <p>"That doctor has got a heart," soliloquized Jonathan, as he closed the door and
                  resumed his seat. "All doctors ought to have, but some haven't. There's some don't
                  care how long a person's sick, so long as he's able to pay. They don't care how
                  much one groans, If the chink of silver or gold is to follow. And that's wrong. A
                  doctor ought to have a heart. A lawyer can get along first-rate without any—in
                  fact, the less he has, the better, especially if he's public prosecutor."</p>
               <p>The old man's soliloquy was broken in upon by his wife, who, stepping very softly,
                  entered the room.</p>
               <p>"How is the poor lady now?" asked the old man.</p>
               <p>"The Lord of mercy only knows. She's weak, and failing fast. But keep still,
                  Jonathan, for the baby has gone to sleep on her bosom, and she seems quiet and
                  drowsy-like, and maybe she'll take a nap, if we don't disturb her," said Betsy, in
                  a whisper.</p>
               <p>The old man nodded an assent to her suggestion; and, folding his arms, lay back in
                  the old rocking-chair which he occupied, and soon his eyes closed in slumber—for
                  he was weary, and much needed rest.</p>

               <p>Days had elapsed, when Doctor Watson, poor Adelia's physician, who had repeatedly
                  sought, in vain, to obtain an interview with Richard Mildollar, at last
                  succeeded.</p>
               <p>The old man was unusually pale and nervous, looking as if he had been seriously
                  ill.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, what do you want?" he asked, abruptly, as the doctor entered his
                  sitting-room.</p>
               <p>"You have a daughter, sir—whom I would—"</p>
               <p>"It is <emph>false</emph>, sir—FALSE as hell, sir!" cried the merchant,
                  passionately, interrupting the physician as well by gesture as by words.</p>
               <p>"She is dying, sir. She only asks one kind look—one word of forgiveness from your
                  lips."</p>
               <p>"To save her soul from eternal perdition. I would not breathe that word!"</p>
               <p>"But, sir, listen yet a moment. She has a babe—a poor, innocent, helpless thing.
                  It, at least, has a claim upon your pity."</p>
               <p>"None, sir, none—<emph>none</emph>, I say! Kill it, and let it rot with her in the
                  grave!"</p>
               <p>"Curse me if it shall, you heartless old miser!" cried one who had entered the
                  room without being observed by either of the previous occupants.</p>
               <p>"What! <emph>Gerald Andros!</emph>" cried the merchant, in surprise. "Where is the
                  Racer, the best of all my ships?"</p>
               <p>"Where I wish every one besides that you own was—at the bottom of the sea! I,
                  alone, of all her crew, am left to cheer you with the good news!" said Andros,
                  with a sarcastic sneer.</p>
               <p>"My best ship gone, cargo and all, and no insurance!" said the merchant, with a
                  groan—forgetting, in his sordid selfishness, the greater evil which hung about
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Where is Adelia—where is my child?" asked Andros, now turning to the doctor.</p>
               <p>"The lady you have so cruelly wronged is in the house of a poor but good man,
                     who<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6962-00000007"/> saved her from committing suicide,
                  when her father, at the midnight hour, turned her, in the bitterness of a
                  winter-storm, from his door," said the doctor, who had heard the story from
                  Adelia's lips, which made him know who it was that stood before him.</p>
               <p>"I am a villain—a wretch!" said Andros, in a low tone, "but not worse than
                     <emph>he!</emph> I wished to marry her; but when once I hinted as much to him,
                  I was told to leave his service if I dared express the thought again. We 'loved
                  not wisely, but too well;' and I meant to wed her on my return from a voyage in
                  which I would have won an independence from him! But, sir, it is not too late;
                  lead me to her—but I forgot! Mr. Mildollar, you owe me over three thousand
                  dollars. Pay me a part of it now—your daughter must not want."</p>
               <p>"Not a dollar—not a dollar shall you have, Gerald Andros! You have lost my best
                  ship—my best ship, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Curse you and your ships! Before you are a year older, you shall not have one
                  afloat on salt water! Doctor, take me to Adelia. Wretch though I be, I am not yet
                  utterly lost to humanity."</p>
               <p>"Once more I ask, sir," said the doctor to Mildollar—"will you see your
                  daughter?"</p>
               <p>"No!" thundered the merchant.</p>
               <p>"At least send a kind message to her—I repeat that she is dying."</p>
               <p>"Let her die—I care not!" said the merchant, bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Then I have no longer any business here," said he doctor. And turning upon his
                  heel, he left the apartment, closely followed by Gerald Andros.</p>

               <p>A lily floating upon the black lake of death—so cold, so white, so beautiful! The
                  soft hands crossed upon the still breast; the long, curling tresses, ebon black,
                  lying asleep along the white neck and shoulders; the dark eyelashes, pendant from
                  the closed eyes, down upon the snowy cheek, like penciled lines. So beautiful! but
                  dead—dead to sorrow, now, and woe—dead to the wail of the young life-bud just
                  sprung into the heartless world!</p>
               <p>There and thus lay poor Adelia when the doctor, accompanied by Gerald Andros,
                  entered the room where she had seen "the last of earth."</p>
               <p>"Poor creature! she is gone, doctor," sobbed Betsy, as the physician entered.</p>
               <p>And the babe in her arms uttered a mournful, wailing cry, as if it known its
                  loss.</p>
               <p>"She died like a lamb, poor thing!" said the honest watchman, wiping away the
                  tears from his furrowed checks.</p>
               <p>"Adelia—Adelia! Dead—dead! and I am her murderer!" groaned Andros; and he threw
                  himself, with passionate tears, upon his knees by the bedside.</p>
               <p>They let him weep. The tears of penitence should never be restrained.</p>
               <p>When he ceased sobbing, and raised his eyes once more to look upon her, he saw a
                  paper which even in death she had held to her bosom. It was addressed to him. Upon
                  it was written:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"Gerald, you will come to me when it is too late. I forgive you! Protect our
                        <emph>Elfrida</emph>—for the world will not. She is <emph>the child of
                        shame!</emph>"</p>
               </q>
               <p>He rose, placed that paper in his bosom, next his heart, pressed a kiss upon her
                  pale brow, and turned to look upon his child. He took it in his arms, and once
                  more the hot tears rained from his eyes, while he kissed it again and again. And
                  it cried piteously, as if it already felt the heartless world-curse which
                     <emph>society</emph> would fasten on its innocence, because its parents had
                  sinned!</p>
               <p>In a little while, Andros became more calm, and he resigned the child again to
                  Betsy. Then taking from his pocket a purse of gold, he said: "Here is only a
                  hundred dollars; it is all that I now have in the world, for I am ruined by my
                  wreck. But I will <emph>force</emph> more from the miser who owes it to me, and
                  you shall all be paid—paid a princely reward for this last kindness to a suffering
                  angel! Good woman, take care of my poor child, even as if it were your own, and
                  you shall be richly paid. Doctor, let me ask of you a last favor—see the necessary
                  arrangements made for her burial. I have not the nerve to do that—I am a wretched
                  and unhappy man, but I will get money and defray every expense!"</p>
               <p>The doctor bowed assent, and Andros, after one more agonized glance at poor
                  Adelia—one more look at his child, hurried from the room.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>A very short time only had elapsed after the doctor and Gerald Andros had left the
                  presence of Richard Mildollar, when Mrs. Mildollar—<foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >née</foreign> Mrs. Corryell—entered the room in which the merchant was pacing
                  to and fro in great agitation.</p>
               <p>"My dear Mr. Mildollar, are you ill?" she asked, in a very sympathetic tone.</p>
               <p>"Yes! Lost my best ship!" he growled, sulkily.</p>
               <p>"The loss of a single ship is not much when you have so many," she said,
                  quietly.</p>
               <p>"Not much—a ship worth sixty thousand dollars, and a cargo of twice the value! Not
                     <emph>much!</emph> If Gerald Andros had only perished with it!" almost shouted
                  the passionate man.</p>
               <p>"But he did not, Richard Mildollar—he did not!" said he of whom the latter had
                  just spoken, entering the room, abruptly.</p>
               <p>"Madam, you will be pleased to retire. I wish to see this person alone!" said the
                  merchant, sternly, to his wife.</p>
               <p>She obeyed; for there was an expression upon his face which told that obedience on
                  her part would be wisdom.</p>
               <p>"Well, scoundrel, what do you want here?" said the merchant, in a bitter tone.</p>
               <p>"Money to bury your daughter!" said Andros, quietly; but his keen black eye seemed
                  to look the merchant through and through.</p>
               <p>For an instant, only, a quiver was perceptible on the lip and in the frame of
                  Richard Mildollar—for a second his eye dropped and his breath came gaspingly; but
                  it was over, and he answered: "Not a dollar from me, sir—not a dollar!"</p>
               <p>"Give me what you owe me, or there will be <emph>two</emph> funerals instead of
                  one!" said the young captain; and a look of fierce determination told that he was
                  but too ready to use the pistol which he presented to the old man's breast.</p>
               <p>"God! You would not kill me?" cried the merchant, starting back in terror.</p>
               <p>"As readily as I would a dog! I care for nothing now—give me the money!"</p>
               <p>"I will draw a check!"</p>
               <p>"None of your checks for me. You can order another kind of <emph>check</emph> at
                  the bank, before I draw! Give me gold or your heart's blood!" exclaimed Andros,
                  fiercely.</p>
               <p>"Lower your pistol, and I will," said Mildollar, nervously; for though he dreaded
                  the loss of money, the loss of his own life weighed heaviest in his mind.</p>
               <p>"Be in a hurry, then!" said Andros, lowering his weapon, but keeping his keen eye
                  fixed upon the old man.</p>
               <p>The latter went to a desk, and opening a small iron box within it, counted out the
                  sum in gold which the young man had stated to be due to him, in the previous
                  interview.</p>
               <p>"Take it—my curse goes with it!" said Mildollar, bitterly.</p>
               <p>"A fig for all your curses, and no thanks for the money—it is my own!" said
                  Andros, contemptuously. "And," he added, "mark my words, Richard Mildollar—I have
                  been a very slave to your will for years—have in all cases done your bidding; made
                  hundreds of thousands of dollars for you—most of it illegally. I know your trade
                  and ways—every ship you own. You have just called me a scoundrel! Well, I am one.
                  You made me one—abused me like a dog till I could be of service to you, and petted
                  me like a useful one when I became so. Now, dog-like—scoundrel-like if you prefer
                  it—I am going to turn upon you. The hour when the cold earth hides poor Adelia's
                  form from my view, will be the last which restrains the ferocity of my nature. I
                  will ruin you! By the memory of Adelia, I swear it. By the helplessness of her
                  child, I swear it! Farewell!—but not forever! Insure every ship you have if you
                  can; but no insurance office will guarantee your vessels' safety from <emph>Gerald
                     Andros, the pirate;</emph> for they shall have warning!"</p>
               <p>The speaker, whose tone had been low and stern, now turned upon his heel to leave
                  the apartment. The merchant, who seemed to have been terrified into submission and
                  silence cried:</p>
               <p>"Stay one moment; one moment, Gerald—where—where is the body of my child?"</p>
               <p>"Beneath a stranger's roof, and ready for the grave! I go to bury her!" was the
                  only reply; and Andros left the room.</p>
               <p>The merchant sank pale and gasping into a seat, for the excitement was too much
                  for him</p>
               <p>"May I come in?" asked a voice at the door.</p>
               <p>"Yes—bring me some wine, brandy, anything—I am faint," replied the merchant,
                  recognizing his wife in the speaker.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <p>All that was mortal of poor Adelia had been laid down in the cold earth. And in
                  the poor dwelling of good Jonathan Birdsall, were assembled four persons—five, if
                  we count Elfrida, the poor babe—the watchman and his wife, the doctor and Gerald
                  Andros. They all looked sad; the latter was very pale, but quiet in his grief, if
                  grief he felt.</p>
               <p>"There are two thousand dollars for you, my good friends!" said Andros, laying the
                  gold down upon the table before the watchman and his wife. "Keep it for what you
                  have done, and will do for that poor child. Each year, on the sad anniversary of
                  Adelia's death, you will receive a like sum, even if you do not see me—for I may
                  be far away from here, at times."</p>
               <p>"But, sir, this is too much money. We never had so much before—we may be robbed!"
                  said the watchman, earnestly.</p>
               <p>"You must stay at home and take care of it. You are too old for the exposure of a
                  night-watch. Open some little business—a little store, for instance, and live in
                  comfort hereafter. If you see me no more, when my child is old enough to
                  comprehend the ways of the world, give her this sealed package. It is written by
                  me, and will tell her that which she may need to know. Let not the seal be broken
                  by any one else."</p>
               <p>The old watchman looked from the money to the doctor. He did not know what to
                  do.</p>
               <p>"Take the gold, my friends, and do with it as he directs. The great misfortune
                  which has befallen the poor lady, will in this way be lessened to her child," said
                  the physician.</p>
               <p>"You are not forgotten, doctor," said Andros; "I wish that I could reward you more
                  richly. The time may come when I will be able to."</p>
               <p>And he laid two hundred dollars before the doctor.</p>
               <p>"I will not take money from you," said the latter, feelingly. "And I will do you
                  the justice to say, that I believe if the mother of your child had lived, you
                  would have wedded her before the world, and so lived as to have redeemed
                  yourself!"</p>
               <p>"You do me but justice in that, sir, as Heaven can bear witness. If you will not
                     take<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6962-00000008"/> money, at least wear this, for my
                  sake!" and he took a splendid chronometer watch, guarded by a Genoa chain of
                  exquisite workmanship, from his pocket, and placed it in the hands of the doctor.
                  "Do not refuse me; for it will add to my present pain!"</p>
               <p>"I accept the memento and will keep it!" said the physician.</p>
               <p>"I thank you," said Andros. "I need not ask you with our friends to watch over
                  poor little Elfrida; I know that you will do so. Above all things, keep a
                  knowledge of her whereabouts from Richard Mildollar: And now, farewell. You may
                  see me again—you may not; but if you do not, and she should grow up, if ever you
                  should see my name mentioned, coupled with dishonor, hide that name and fact from
                  her."</p>
               <p>He said no more; but, taking up the money which the doctor had refused, turned
                  away, and left the house.</p>
               <p>"I do declare that there's no man so bad lest what there's some good in him!" said
                  Betsy—who looked quite worn out from her recent watching and nursing duties.</p>
               <p>"Nor any evil which has not some good in it," said the doctor, glancing at the
                  money. "By care, yourself and husband can now get along in comfort—he, without
                  exposure; you, without so much labor and deprivation of those comforts which are
                  needed by those who approach the winter season of life."</p>
               <p>"Well, we must be thankful for all that comes!" said the old watchman. "If it's a
                  good, 'tis a blessing; if it seems an evil, it may be the same; for the Bible
                  says: 'Whom He loveth, He chasteneth.' And there's a comfort in even that."</p>
               <p>The doctor now took his leave, promising to come in from time to time to see the
                  child.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <p>A year had passed—a year to a day on the anniversary of poor Adelia's death. The
                  doctor, who had kept his promise of calling occasionally to see the Birdsalls and
                  their infant <foreign xml:lang="FRA">protégée</foreign>, was sitting in the neat
                  room back of the shop which they now kept; for Jonathan no longer kept the
                  night-watch. The good physician had the child (now grown into a beauty—a perfect
                  little flower of a baby, with great black eyes, rosy checks, and curling hair as
                  black as night) in his arms, and was amusing it and himself with "baby-talk"—that
                  language which old maids and miserable bachelors so like to ridicule, but which
                  comes up saccharinely from the good heart, like strawberries floating in
                  cream.</p>
               <p>The old folks were both in the back room, talking with their guest; for the door
                  was open between them and the shop, and they could see any customer that
                  entered.</p>
               <p>And one came in—a large, stoutly-built man, with heavy black whiskers and a
                  devilish eye, who was dressed in a seaman's garb. He did not wait for the old
                  watchman to go and ask him what he wanted, but bolted right into the back room,
                  and asked if Jonathan and Betsy Birdsall lived there.</p>
               <p>"That's <emph>we</emph>," said the old man, pointing to Betsy, and touching his
                  own head.</p>
               <p>"There's something for you from the captain," said the stranger, tossing a heavy
                  bag upon the table. He then glanced at the child intently for an instant, turned,
                  and went out without saying another word.</p>
               <p>The father of Elfrida had been true to his word. The bag contained two thousand
                  dollars in gold, but not a word in writing connected with it.</p>
               <p>"I should ha' thought he'd brought it himself, and come to see his baby," said
                  Betsy, as her husband looked at the gold.</p>
               <p>"I reckon he knows we're taking good care of it. I hope he'll never come—that is,
                  if he means to take her away. I'd rather he'd keep his money, and let us have the
                  child for always; for I'm sure I love it as much as if it was my own."</p>
               <p>"'Tis a sweet babe," said Doctor Watson, with a sigh. "I shall miss it while I am
                  away on my visit to Europe."</p>
               <p>"When do you sail, doctor?" asked the old man.</p>
               <p>"Next week. I am deputed by our Medical Board to visit the English and French
                  hospitals for scientific purposes, and must go."</p>
               <p>"In what vessel?" asked Betsy—not that she knew anything about vessels, but
                  because she, like most women, where there are three in the party, wanted something
                  to say.</p>
               <p>"I do not know yet—the first which sails for London after Monday next," replied
                  the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Well, all we can do is, to pray that you may make a prosperous voyage and a
                  speedy return!" said the old watchman.</p>
               <p>The doctor thanked him; and, after resigning the babe to its foster-mother, bade
                  them good-night, and departed.</p>
               <p>The health of Mr. Richard Mildollar had been gradually failing ever since the
                  night when he had driven his poor erring child so heartlessly from the door. He
                  had been annoyed in business. Several of his ships which he had sent to distant
                  parts with costly cargoes had neither returned nor ever been heard of; and every
                  insurance office which he now solicited to secure him against loss (formerly he
                  did not patronize them, but insured himself) insisted (and would give no reason
                  for it) only upon insuring him against actual and proven wreck. They would not pay
                  for a missing vessel, or one taken by pirates.</p>
               <p>These troubles, coupled with a sorrow which he would not acknowledge, but one
                  which in his heart he deeply felt (for he had loved his daughter as much as he was
                  capable of loving anything but gold), had brought him into a nervous decline,
                  which was fast carrying him down toward the grave.</p>
               <p>His medical advisers insisted upon travel, relaxation from business, and a change
                  of scene, as positively necessary for the prolongation of his life. His wife (who,
                  with her hopeful son, wished to see Europe and its fashions), under the guise of
                  affection and anxiety for his life, added her pleas for him to take the tour which
                  his physicians had decided upon; and he had at last consented. And upon the same
                  evening when the strange sailor visited the Birdsalls to leave the promised annual
                  deposit, Mr. Mildollar announced to his wife and stepson that they would sail for
                  London in the course of the ensuing week in a new and beautiful ship which he had
                  built to take the place of the Racer in her peculiar trade, but which he intended
                  now to test in a trial-trip to Europe.</p>
               <p>The announcement gave great pleasure to both mother and son; for they looked
                  forward to all the pleasures which money could procure; but, with that duplicity
                  which had sometimes quite blinded the keen-sighted merchant, they endeavored to
                  make him believe that their joy arose from the hope that the voyage would speedily
                  restore his health—to them so very precious!</p>
               <p>Accursed hypocrisy! Yet how prevalent is it among fast and fashionable
                  heir-expectants! How they sigh with their lips, and laugh in their ossified
                  hearts, when a hectic flush or a lung-rending cough tells them that the "old man"
                  or "old woman" is about to "step out" of their way! They can hardly go by a
                  mourning-store without going in to look out a funeral-suit.</p>
               <p>Poverty softens most hearts: gold always hardens them; and the expectation of it
                  would turn an angel into a devil.</p>

               <p>The good ship Merlin (Mildollar owner, and John Jones captain) lay off in the
                  stream in the middle of the East River, only waiting for the owner and his family
                  to come on board, before her anchor, which was almost apeak, should be weighed,
                  and her sails, already loosed, should be spread to the quiet westerly breeze which
                  lazily lifted her ensign and burgee. She was not deeply laden, but had a cargo
                  sufficiently heavy to put her in fine sailing-trim.</p>
               <p>Her passenger-list was as full as her accommodations (which were elegant and
                  extensive) would admit; and, as hers was the regular packet-day, all were aboard
                  betimes.</p>
               <p>Among these passengers were but two who will much interest us at present. One was
                  our good friend, Dr. Watson, whose true-hearted feeling has already been seen by
                  the reader; the other was a young Irish peer—Lord Tyrconnel—who, unlike most of
                  those who hold peerages in Ireland, had lived as <emph>home</emph>, instead of in
                  England, until he had taken it into his wild head to come over and see the
                  quadrupedal and bipedal savages of North America. He had met and been introduced
                  to Dr. Watson at the then leading hotel of Gotham (the "City"—all respect to its
                  memory!); and these two, not knowing any of the other passengers, and being
                  mutually pleased with each other, had taken a double-berthed state-room
                  together.</p>
               <p>"What sort of a chap is this owner they're waiting for so long, when nayther wind
                  nor tide will wait for us?" asked Lord Tyrconnel, in a musical brogue, which his
                  home education had not spoiled.</p>
               <p>"A man I do not like; but there he comes with his family," said Dr. Watson,
                  pointing to an eight-oared custom-house barge, which had been obsequiously placed
                  at the service of the millionaire-merchant by officials who knew the weight of his
                  influence.</p>
               <p>"Then, by the honor of the Tyrconnels!—which has never been misdoubted or
                  misplaced, doctor dear—if you don't like him, it's Terrence Tyrconnel that'll hate
                  him entirely," said the warm-hearted Celtic peer.</p>
               <p>"You must judge him for yourself, and not follow my dislikes, my lord," said the
                  doctor.</p>
               <p>"Doctor, why will ye persist in calling me 'me lord,' when the good Lord above
                  knows I'd only be plain Terrence Tyrconnel with yourself?"</p>
               <p>"Well, Terrence it shall be, for the rest of the voyage, if 'twill please you,"
                  said the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Thank ye, ould boy. And now let's go to the state-room, and touch a drop of the
                  ould Monongahela that father Jennings, of the 'City,' sent aboard with my
                  baggage."</p>
               <p>"I'll join you there; but first let us see the new-comers aboard," said the
                  doctor. "I hate and despise old Mildollar; but, since I have had to take passage
                  on his ship, I want to meet his eye at the first, and to show him that on the
                  voyage we must be strangers. He insulted me once when I wished to do him a
                  kindness."</p>
               <p>"Insulted you? And why didn't you call him out, and settle his coffee with an
                  ounce or lead?"</p>
               <p>"Under the circumstances, I could not; but I will be even with him yet."</p>
               <p>"Trud the gangway ladders there, a dozen or more of you! Look out and hand the
                  manropes, and stand by to pass the owner's baggage aboard!" said Captain Jones, as
                  the custom-house barge approached.</p>
               <p>In a moment or two more, it was alongside; and Mr. Mildollar, pale and feeble, was
                  carefully helped over the side by the captain. The eye of the old merchant fell on
                  Dr. Watson among the group of passengers, and a flush mantling his cheek, told
                  that he recognized him; but he made no other sign, and hurried<pb
                     n="16-17 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6962-00000009"/> aft to the cabin. The
                  polite captain next assisted Mrs. Mildollar over the side—a service which she
                  accepted with condescending dignity. A rough-looking Celtic sailor offered to do
                  the same for her maid (a Stewart's syrup-colored demoiselle, who, hailing from New
                  Orleans, called herself French—though her French was a creole <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">patois</foreign>, mingled with abominable English). But the
                  dignity of the maid was a stretch above the level of a common sailor; and she
                  pushed him back with her umbrella, and said:</p>
               <p>"No you touchee me, tarry sailor-man! No you touchee me wiz your dirty hands."</p>
               <p>"Be jabers! if my hands were as dirty as yer face, I'd be afther washin' 'em afore
                  I'd feed the cap'n's pig," said the indignant sailor, as he drew back to let her
                  pass.</p>
               <p>Next came Master Harry Corryell, followed by his valet, who looked quite as much
                  of the gentleman as he did, if not more.</p>
               <p>His passengers were now all on board; so Captain Jones gave orders to his mate to
                  heave up the anchor, and make sail as the pilot directed, while be went into his
                  cabin to entertain the custom-house officer—a matter never neglected by any
                  prudent captain, whether coming into or going out of port.</p>
               <p>"How do you like the looks of the new-comers, friend Terrence?" asked Dr. Watson,
                  as they walked aft to a position near the taffrail.</p>
               <p>"The ould man looks as if the devil had a mortgage on his soul, and the
                  undertakers had orders for his coffin," said Tyrconnel. "The ould woman was under
                  false colors; so I'd take her for a bit of a pirate, with a nager in tow to wait
                  on her. As to the chap that you say calls her mother, he's a cowardly spalpeen, if
                  my eyes are true. Lyin' is aisy to him, I'll wager a crown to a groat!"</p>
               <p>"I know but little of him, and nothing to his advantage," said Watson. "But if
                  you'll come below, I'll tell you why I so dislike the old man, and why he either
                  fears or dislikes me."</p>
               <p>"I'm with you, doctor dear; for I like to hear a good story better than anything
                  else but bating a squad o' watchmen, or riding a stayple-chase in town on a
                  market-day."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <p>The Merlin had been at sea ten or eleven days, and though the winds had been
                  light, she had made fair progress; for they were such as enabled her to lay her
                  course; and she was now in mid-ocean. Captain Jones was popular with his
                  passengers; for his table was well supplied, and he was ever ready with a
                  courteous answer to the many questions with which a skipper is always pestered. He
                  was a good sailor, withal, and, as such, popular with his crew; for seamen will
                  bear many a harsh word from a "thorough-bred," which a lubber wouldn't dare to
                  utter a second time to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mildollar, either on account of his health or from a desire to avoid
                  observation, remained mostly in his cabin; but his wife and her molasses-colored
                  maid, after the first three or four days of fashionable sea-sickness, were often
                  seen on the quarter-deck, as was also Master Harry Corryell—who, in spite of many
                  hints, and finally an order from Captain Jones, persisted in breaking a rigid rule
                  on shipboard—that of not smoking abaft the mainmast.</p>
               <p>Being the owner's step-son, he considered himself privileged to do as he pleased;
                  and so he told Captain Jones, when the latter positively forbade him to smoke upon
                  the quarterdeck.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you will try force to stop me?" said the mannerless cub to Captain
                  Jones—who, being a man verging on sixty, he thought to intimidate.</p>
               <p>"If you make it necessary, I shall," replied the old man, sternly.</p>
               <p>"Just say the word, Captain Jones, and let me shake the pin-feathers out o' the
                  popinjay," said Lord Tyrconnel, who had been long disgusted with the apish airs of
                  young Corryell.</p>
               <p>"Sail ho!" shouted the look-out from his perch on the foretop-gallant cross-trees;
                  and that magic cry for the time put a stop to a scene which might have been
                  belligerent; for an angry reply was on the lips of the young upstart, which would
                  undoubtedly have met with a serious rejoinder from the Irish peer had it been
                  uttered.</p>
               <p>"Where away, and what does the stranger look like?" asked Captain Jones.</p>
               <p>"Dead ahead, sir; apparently a large fore-top-sail schooner, either on a wind, or
                  hauled up pretty nigh it."</p>
               <p>"Very well; keep an eye on her, and see if we raise her any."</p>
               <p>"We're raising her very fast, sir—as fast as if she was laying-to; for it is only
                  a little while since I first made her out no bigger than a gull on the water, and
                  now I can make out her rig easily."</p>
               <p>"Tell the steward to send me my glass, boy," said the captain to one of the ship's
                  apprentices who stood near.</p>
               <p>"A glass of what, sir?" said the youngster, very innocently—though a merry twinkle
                  in his eye told that he wanted to "sell" the skipper.</p>
               <p>"A spy-glass for me, and a glass of the oil of hemp for you, you monkey, if it
                  isn't here in less than a minute," said the captain.</p>
               <p>Within thirty seconds, the glass was in his hand; and the old skipper went up to
                  the foreyard to take a look at the strange sail for himself. He remained there for
                  a considerable length of time; and when he came down, there was a look of
                  dissatisfaction on his usually pleasant face.</p>

               <p>"There's something wrong in the craft ahead, or the ould man wouldn't look so
                  grum, doctor," said Tyrconnell. "I'll ask him what kind of a vessel it is! What
                  have you been looking at so long, Captain Jones?"</p>
               <p>"A saucy-looking schooner laying-to right across our fore-foot!" said the skipper,
                  in a low tone. "If she has any business, she ought to be about it, and not wasting
                  such a breeze as this!"</p>
               <p>"May be she's a man-o'-war, and wants to spake us!"</p>
               <p>"A man-o'-war would have her ensign and pendant flying. She shows neither! Mate,
                  hoist our colors!" said the old man.</p>
               <p>"Has she a suspicious look?" asked Doctor Watson.</p>
               <p>"If I was in the Bahama Channel, or down about the Keys of the Gulf, I'd say she
                  was a pirate! But this is no cruising-ground for such sharks!"</p>
               <p>"A pirate?" asked young Corryell, with a pallid face and trembling body.</p>
               <p>"If you are to hang at her yard-arm, I don't much care if she is!" said the angry
                  captain.</p>
               <p>The young man did not pause to make a reply, but in an instant he was half-way
                  down the companion ladder, on his way to the after-cabin.</p>
               <p>Scarce a minute had elapsed, before Mrs. Mildollar and her maid were on deck.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Captain Jones!" cried Mrs. M., hysterically—"<emph>oh</emph>, Captain Jones,
                  what shall we do? My son tells me that you say there is a pirate close to us!"</p>
               <p>"Your son <emph>lies</emph>, madam, I've said no such thing!" said the blunt old
                  seaman.</p>
               <p>"Oh Harry, how could you frighten me so, when my nerves are <emph>so</emph>
                  shattered!" said the afflicted lady.</p>
               <p>"He did say the vessel looked suspicious!" said the young man, recovering his
                  color and some coolness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mildollar at this moment came on deck, tottering with weakness and looking so
                  pale and ill that even Doctor Watson, forgetting his insults and hard-heartedness,
                  almost pitied him.</p>
               <p>"What's this talk about a pirate, Jones, what <emph>is</emph> it?" he asked, as he
                  caught hold of the skipper's shoulder to keep from falling.</p>
               <p>"Nothing sir—<emph>nothing!</emph> You ought not to have left your cabin when you
                  are so sick!"</p>
               <p>"Sick—I'm <emph>not</emph> sick!" said the merchant, flushing up with momentary
                  excitement. "See, I am as strong as any man!"</p>
               <p>And he let go of the captain's shoulder and started to walk aft toward the
                  taffrail. But he reeled and would have fallen to the deck had not Doctor Watson
                  sprung forward and caught him in his arms.</p>
               <p>"Who are you, sir?" asked the invalid, as the doctor steadied him to the seat
                  which he had tried to reach.</p>
               <p>"I should think Richard Mildollar had known me too long to ask that question. You
                  knew me well enough when I pleaded with you to save the life, or at least to
                  comfort the death of an erring child!"</p>
               <p>The old merchant shook, as if with an ague fit.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes!" he muttered. "Yes, I know you, Watson; I <emph>know</emph> you, and
                  you are here to add to my torment. Go on, go on; I am dying, and I know it. Go on,
                  and persecute a dying man!"</p>
               <p>"I do not wish to persecute you, Mr. Mildollar," said the doctor, kindly, "and if
                  you are really so ill, all my professional skill and knowledge is at your service,
                  freely."</p>
               <p>"If—<emph>if</emph> I am ill?" said the other, impatiently. "Can't you
                     <emph>see</emph> that I am dying?"</p>
               <p>"Not with bodily ailment, but a troubled mind," said the doctor. "If your mind was
                  at rest, your body would soon recover."</p>
               <p>"Wonderful, for a doctor. I believe you're telling the truth. Perhaps you can do
                  more, and <emph>make</emph> my mind easy?"</p>
               <p>The tone of the merchant was slightly sarcastic, as he said this, but Watson,
                  apparently taking no notice of it, said:</p>
               <p>"I believe your mind would be easier, if you recognized and adopted the lovely
                  child of your dead daughter, who otherwise will remain a waif in the hands of
                  strangers."</p>
               <p>The face of the old merchant flushed up, and he evidently intended to make a
                  bitter reply, when the first officer of the ship, who had been looking at the
                  strange sail through his spy-glass, sang out:</p>
               <p>"There go the devilish rascal's colors to his mast-head, and—by mighty—they're
                  black, with the death's-head and cross-bones!"</p>
               <p>This sudden announcement brought a succession of hysterical screams from Mrs.
                  Mildollar, fortunately followed by a fainting-fit, in which she was carried below.
                  Her hopeful son, with a low groan, preceded her, in a search for a
                  hiding-place.</p>
               <p>Of course, all was excitement on board now but Captain Jones, seeming the coolest
                  of all at once gave orders to take in the studding-sails, and put the helm down,
                  to haul by the wind—determined, if possible, to get out of the vicinity of one who
                  so boldly proclaimed his character. The stranger was yet between one and two miles
                  distant, and as the Merlin was new, and modeled with a design for speed, Jones was
                  not utterly without hope of outsailing her in that breeze, if none of his spars
                  were crippled.</p>
               <p>"Hadn't you better go below, sir?" he asked of the owner, as soon as he had
                  time.</p>
               <p>"No, sir; <emph>no</emph>, sir! I shall stay on deck. See that you defend the ship
                  to the uttermost, sir, to the uttermost. She cost me sixty-five thousand dollars,
                  sir; sixty-five thousand, sir, and isn't insured for a cent, sir; not a cent!"</p>
               <p>"Insurance on her, or our lives, won't be worth much, sir, if that black devil
                  gets along<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6962-00000011"/> side," said Captain Jones,
                  gloomily. "Handspikes and belaying-pins are poor weapons to put against powder,
                  lead, and steel."</p>
               <p>"See, then, that she <emph>doesn't</emph> get alongside," said the merchant,
                  testily.</p>
               <p>"I shall do my best, sir, you may depend," said Jones. "My wife and children value
                  my life more than they would all your wealth."</p>
               <p>And he went forward to see that every sail was set to draw to the best advantage.
                  As he did so, a heavy shot from the strange vessel came dashing through the
                  foresail, just above the tack-blocks, and plunged heavily into the sea beyond.</p>
               <p>"Faith, the divil seems to be in earnest. He manes something by that," said
                  Tyrconnel, so earnestly, that the doctor could not restrain a smile. "I've a case
                  of as pretty barkers as ever a gentleman faced at ten paces, in my trunk. I'll go
                  and load 'em, for I may want personal satisfaction out of the fellow, by-and-by,
                  if he acts so rough at first."</p>
               <p>The schooner threw but one more shot, which cut away a topgallant back-stay, and
                  pierced a hole in the mainsail, before she filled away, and hauled up on a wind in
                  chase. Captain Jones anxiously watched now to see if she gained, and his
                  despairing look as he went aft, told that she did.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you make your crew ready for fighting?" asked Mr. Mildollar,
                  impatiently.</p>
               <p>"Resistance will be worse than useless, sir," replied the captain. 'The crew of
                  this vessel number but sixteen, all told; with the passengers, there are about
                  thirty-five people on board, unarmed, while the deck of the schooner is black with
                  men, a hundred at least, and twelve guns peep from her port-holes, while two long
                  brass guns are mounted on pivots, forward and amidships. If we do not resist, the
                  fellow may be satisfied with plunder, and spare life, which he will not be likely
                  to do if we offer a useless opposition."</p>
               <p>As this opinion was spoken in the hearing of his mates, and several of the
                  passengers, they instantly coincided with the captain, and advised him to
                  heave-to, and haul down his colors, for the schooner was gaining very fast, and
                  would soon be alongside, at any rate.</p>
               <p>"Do as you like, Captain Jones; do as you like," said the old merchant, testily.
                  "But mark me, if you <emph>do</emph> give up, this is the last voyage you'll ever
                  make for me."</p>
               <p>"If my life is spared, it will be the last voyage I will ever make for any one,"
                  muttered the old man, as he ordered the helm put a-lee, the mainyards thrown
                  aback, and the colors to be hauled down.</p>
               <p>Just as this was done, Tyrconnel came on deck with a superb pair of dueling
                  pistols put in a belt, made out of a scarf, with the steward's carving-knife
                  thrust in alongside of them, his coat laid aside, and a red bandanna bound in
                  quite brigandish style about his head.</p>
               <p>"They'll take you for the fighting-captain of the ship, friend Terrence," said the
                  doctor with a smile, as he saw the outfit of his friend.</p>
               <p>"And if they don't keep civil tongues in their heads, maybe they'll find that I am
                  all of that," said the peer. "But what are they hauling down our colors for?"</p>
               <p>"Because to resist will be madness; not to do so, may save us from everything but
                  plunder."</p>
               <p>"Everything but <emph>plunder?</emph> By the fame o' my grandfather, if they offer
                  to plunder me, its a fray gift of two ounces o' lead I'll put in the bargain."</p>
               <p>"The '<emph>fray</emph>' might be as serious as the gift," said the doctor.</p>
               <p>The schooner, which had head-reached the ship on the same tack, now came about,
                  and stood across her bows, so closely, that as she stood up in the wind, with her
                  foretopsail aback, and her head-sheets hauled to the windward, she lay almost
                  motionless on the weather beam of the ship, about half a cable's length distant.
                  Her crew, a black and swarthy looking set, apparently mostly Spanish and
                  Portuguese, armed to the teeth, crowded her decks, and looked with undisguised and
                  triumphant ferocity upon their apparently helpless victims.</p>
               <p>In a few moments, a quarter-boat was lowered, and manned with a dozen armed men,
                  and into this sprung a richly-dressed person, evidently the commander of the
                  schooner, by the respect paid to him. A few strokes of the oars brought the boat
                  alongside of the Merlin, and followed by ten of his men, this individual sprung on
                  board.</p>
               <p>"Gerald Andros, by all that's wonderful!" uttered Mr. Mildollar, with a groan, for
                  he had risen from his seat, and tottered forward as far as the belaying-pin rack,
                  around the mainmast, against which he leaned for support.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <p>"Yes, Gerald Andros, Richard Mildollar—Gerald Andros, once a man and a gentleman;
                  no, I err—once a slave to your will and wishes, but now a free rover of the sea,
                  and your deadliest foe. You have looked for many a ship since I last left your
                  presence, which you will never see again. I took care of the 'Dispatch,' the
                  'Curlew,' the 'Falcon,' and the rest of them. You found my warning told in regard
                  to the insurance, did you not?"</p>
               <p>The merchant groaned, but made no reply.</p>
               <p>"What are you going to do with us?" asked Captain Jones, wishing to know the worst
                  at once.</p>
               <p>"That depends on circumstances, Captain Jones. I would not be hard on you, for you
                  were kind to me when I was a boy; and pirate though I am, I am not quite forgetful
                  of the past. I am only what that heartless miser has made me. But your passengers
                  are not all on deck; there is the she-mate to this old bear, and a cub of hers,
                  whom I miss. You need not deny anything in regard to your passenger-list, or
                  manifest, I have a copy of both. I left New York nearly twenty-four hours later
                  than you did, and can give you papers to that date."</p>
               <p>"Then you knew that <emph>I</emph> was on board?" said Dr. Watson, stepping
                  forward.</p>
               <p>"I did, sir; and for your nobleness on a certain occasion, have determined to
                  spare this ship and her passengers from wrong or insult, on condition that Richard
                  Mildollar gives me his check for her full value."</p>
               <p>"By me sowl; he spakes like a jintleman!" muttered Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"My right hand shall wither before I'll sign such a check!" said the merchant,
                  bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Then I shall only be obliged to take your precious body for security," said
                  Andros, scornfully. "For the sake of two men who have been kind to me when they
                  had the chance, the ship and her crew, and all of the passengers, shall go as free
                  as air; but, if you do not sign the check I demand, which will be
                     <emph>just</emph> 'prize-money' for my crew, I shall hold you and your brood
                  for security. Captain Jones, I wish Mrs. Mildollar and her white livered cub
                  brought on deck."</p>
               <p>"What does the dreadful pirate want with me?" asked the lady in person, for
                  curiosity had got the better of fear, and she had ascended as far as the head of
                  the cabin-ladder, backed by her creole maid.</p>
               <p>"The pleasure of looking at a true descendant of Jezebel," said the pirate, with a
                  sneer. "Steward, bring a couple of chairs out here, for that woman and her
                  husband."</p>
               <p>"<emph>That woman?</emph>" almost shrieked Mrs. Mildollar. "I'd have you to know
                  I'm a <emph>lady</emph>, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Bring up that woman's cub, I want to see him, Jones. If you do not, I shall send
                  a couple of my men after him, and he may find their hands rough."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you needn't send after me; I'm here, Gerald; we used to be the best of
                  friends, you know," stammered the brave Harry Corryell, as pale and trembling he
                  came out from behind the voluminous skirts of his mother. "Don't you remember what
                  sprees we've had together?"</p>
               <p>"I don't remember, but I <emph>suspect</emph>, you double-distilled essence of
                  rascality, that you got me stupefied on some drugged liquor, on the last occasion
                  when I was in your company, and stole a letter from my pocket!" said Andros,
                  bitterly.</p>
               <p>"He didn't <emph>steal</emph> it from you! My brave Harry FORCED it from you; and
                  he told me so. That letter told my dear husband what wretches you and Adelia
                  were!" almost screamed the indignant Mrs. Mildollar.</p>
               <p>For an instant, the face of Andros grew black—black as a terrible thunder-cloud
                  full almost to bursting with fire and water; every vein was swollen; and his eyes
                  glared, and his frame quivered, as if, like a terrible beast, he was about to make
                  a spring upon his victim.</p>
               <p>"So," said he, at last, in a low, husky tone—"so that letter was the cause of her
                  being driven out from her home, to perish—to die among strangers! Dog, you shall
                     <emph>die!</emph>"</p>
               <p>And he sprung at young Corryell with the ferocity of a tiger; but paused, as the
                  latter sunk trembling on his knees, and whined out:</p>
               <p>"'Twas mother that made me do it! Don't hurt me—'twas mother's fault."</p>
               <p>"Death is too good for you—you shall live to suffer, to suffer all that a cowardly
                  dog <emph>can</emph> suffer!" said Andros, bitterly. Then, turning to one of his
                  men, he added: "Baptisto, tie that our hand and foot, and toss him into the bottom
                  of our boat."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you shall not take my darling boy away from me!" screamed Mrs. Mildollar.</p>
               <p>"You can go with him, and witness his punishment," said Andros, with a sneer;
                  then, turning to the merchant, he asked: "Will you ransom your vessel with a check
                  for her value?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes. I want to go home," said the merchant, faintly—"I wan't to go home and
                  die!"</p>
               <p>"Help him to his cabin, Jones; and see that he makes out his check for the full
                  value of the vessel. And remain here, too, till I come back. I am going on board
                  to doctor Master Harry Corryell: he is sick, and must undergo a course of
                  medicine!"</p>
               <p>Saying this, he turned and followed his men, who were carrying away the young man,
                  who was kicking, biting, and screaming, struggling to get away—while his mother
                  fought like a tigress, with teeth and nails, to help him. But, in a moment, he was
                  tossed down into the bottom of the boat; and his mother found it convenient to
                  faint again, rather than to follow him—an opportunity to do which was again
                  offered by Andros.</p>
               <p>The pirate's boat pulled rapidly away, and soon was alongside of the schooner. The
                  crew and passengers of the Merlin saw the young man passed up over her bulwarks,
                  as if his body had been a bundle of goods; and soon after, though they could not
                  see what he was suffering, they could hear him screaming miserably; and from the
                  fiendish laughter of the piratical crew, they knew that he was suffering some
                  fearful torture.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <p>The old merchant had been below but a few moments, when Captain Jones sent his
                  steward up hastily for Dr. Watson—saying that Mr. Mildollar was very ill, and
                  seemed to be dying.</p>
               <p>The doctor, motioning for Tyrconnel to follow him, hurried below, where he found
                  the merchant pale and gasping for breath.</p>
               <p>To loosen his clothing and give him a stimulating<pb n="22-23"
                     xml:id="VAC6962-00000012"/> ulating restorative, was but the work of an
                  instant; but his symptoms were very alarming, and he seemed to be aware of it—for,
                  as soon as he could speak, he gasped:</p>
               <p>"I'm dying, doctor—I'm dying. God have mercy on me! I want—I must write a will. Is
                  her—her child <emph>living</emph>?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Doctor Watson, "and under kind guardianship. I saw her only a day
                  before we sailed."</p>
               <p>"Then write, write, and I will sign. I bequeath all of my property—every cent—to
                  my poor Adelia; for I have been deceived, cruelly deceived. Write, write, and I
                  will sign!"</p>
               <p>"He shall not—he shall not! It is a base conspiracy to rob me and my son of our
                  rights!" screamed Mrs. Mildollar, suddenly recovering from her fainting-fit,
                  though her maid had been for some time vainly laboring to restore her.</p>
               <p>"Write, doctor, write, and as I told you!" gasped the merchant, sinking back upon
                  the cot whereon he had been laid.</p>
               <p>"He shall not. I'll scratch his eyes out. I only married you for your money, and
                  it is mine—<emph>mine! I will have it!</emph>" screamed the maddened woman; and
                  she rose to her feet, and tried to snatch the writing-materials from the
                  table.</p>
               <p>"Madam, if you don't keep quiet, I'll have to show you that I'm captain of this
                  ship, and confine you," said Captain Jones, sternly. Then, glancing at the
                  merchant, and observing a fearful change in his face, he exclaimed: "Heavens!
                  doctor, he is dying!"</p>
               <p>The doctor saw that the danger was imminent, and hastened to again administer a
                  stimulant.</p>
               <p>"Write—write quickly!" gasped the dying man, who had already made out the check
                  demanded by Andros, and who, as soon as he could speak again, showed that justice
                  at last was in his mind.</p>
               <p>The good doctor needed no urging; and briefly, but strongly, he drew up the
                  paper.</p>
               <p>"Who shall I name as executors?" asked the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Yourself and Captain Jones," gasped the merchant. "Be quick, and give me some
                  more wine; I want strength to sign it!"</p>
               <p>"It is done, and only needs your signature to make it legal!" said the doctor, as
                  he gave him the wine.</p>
               <p>Eagerly the old man seized the pen and affixed his name, which was witnessed by
                  Tyrconnel and the steward of the ship. Then, as if satisfied that his last act was
                  one of justice, he sank back upon his pillow; and with a smile on his pale, wan
                  face, went off into the sleep of death.</p>
               <p>The doctor, who held his hand, had scarcely announced this fact, when the
                  newly-made widow—whose eyes had been resting on the fatal paper—sprung forward and
                  seized it, and would have torn it to atoms, had not both the doctor and captain
                  seized and held her. Before the will was rescued from her hands, it was torn and
                  injured, but not materially defaced.</p>
               <p>"If she didn't wear a petticoat, I'd think she was a hyena!" said Tyrconnel, in
                  disgust.</p>
               <p>"You'll all think I'm one before I leave this ship!" she screamed. "I'm owner now;
                  for <emph>he</emph> is dead, and his will isn't worth a snap!"</p>
               <p>"Whether you are owner or not, I'm <emph>captain;</emph> and if you don't keep
                  yourself within the bounds of decency, madam, I'll shut you up in your state-room,
                  and feed you on bread and water. I've borne with your insolence too long already;
                  and you have got to behave yourself now, or I'll make you!" said Captain
                  Jones.</p>
               <p>"O you insolent wretch; I'll make you suffer for this when I get on shore."</p>
               <p>"You'd better hold your tongue, madam, or <emph>your</emph> sufferings will
                  commence long before you reach the shore."</p>
               <p>The entrance of Gerald Andros, with a couple of his men, who bore the form of
                  Harry Corryell, which they tossed on the floor at his mother's feet, probably
                  saved a bitter reply from her lips; for she threw herself upon the body of her
                  son, and screamed:</p>
               <p>"You've murdered my boy—you've murdered my boy!"</p>
               <p>"No, madam—only put him in a condition for your nursing. He has been playing with
                  our eats on board, and got his back scratched some; and we've put his initials on
                  his breast, so that the devil will know him when he gets below," said Andros,
                  pointing to the letter "R" indelibly branded on his bosom. "He may thank his lucky
                  stars for getting off so easy as he has. But I shall meet him again, and prove
                  that my memory is as good as my will for revenge."</p>
               <p>The young man groaned, showing thereby that some life was left in him.</p>
               <p>"He confessed your whole devilish plot to drive poor Adelia away, and thus get all
                  of her father's property. When I know how well you worked on the poor old man's
                  passions, I can almost forgive his cruelty, and transfer all of my hatred to
                  you."</p>
               <p>"You must forgive him now, Andros," said the doctor. "He is past earthly hatred
                  and wrong now"</p>
               <p>"What, dead?" asked Andros.</p>
               <p>"Yes; but before he died, he did this last act of justice."</p>
               <p>And the doctor, as he said this, handed Andros the will for his perusal.</p>
               <p>The bronzed face of the bold, bad man flushed up as he glanced over the document,
                  and tears stole down over his cheeks.</p>
               <p>"Doctor," said he, while his voice quivered—"doctor, I know that I am indebted to
                  you for this. Heaven bless you! I never will forget you. His recognition of her as
                  his grandchild child will place her in society when she grows up; and I ask no
                  more. I care not now when or where I die; I shall go contented, knowing that
                     <emph>you</emph> will look to her welfare and interests."</p>
               <p>"I would rather see you leave your present mode of life, and become a good citizen
                  in some land where, your former career unknown, you might yet see the brighter
                  side of life," said the doctor, with feeling.</p>
               <p>"It is too late—too late!" said Andros, evidently affected.</p>
               <p>"Here is your check, Captain Andros," said the commander of the Merlin.</p>
               <p>"Were it not to satisfy my crew, who do not like to see a prize escape them, I
                  should not take it," said Andros. "I am not a pirate by nature: what I am, that
                  man made me!" And he pointed to the body of the merchant. "But," he added, "his
                  last act redeems all. Farewell, doctor. Keep that will, and look to
                     <emph>her</emph> interests. We shall meet again."</p>
               <p>"And <emph>we</emph> shall meet again, you monster!" cried Mrs. Mildollar, rising
                  up.</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly, madam, <emph>after death!</emph> We are both bound to the same port,
                  I expect," said Andros, coolly.</p>
               <p>"I shall see you hung, you low villain!" cried Mrs. Mildollar.</p>
               <p>"Your greatest misfortune, madam, would be the loss of your tongue. Rouge,
                  pearl-powder, false teeth and hair, can remedy the loss of beauty, in a measure;
                  but the loss of your tongue would be your ruin!" said Andros, as, with a graceful
                  bow to the rest of the company, he turned and left the cabin.</p>
               <p>"Oh, the wretch!" screamed Mrs. Mildollar, and she went off into another
                  faint.</p>
               <p>"The truth strikes home, sure," said Lord Tyrconnel, with a laugh.</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to say that I paint, you Irish blackguard?—or that my hair and teeth
                  are false, you wretch? Oh, how I wish I were a <emph>man!</emph>" screamed the
                  lady, recovering as suddenly as she had gone off.</p>
               <p>"I wish you were, by my faith! I'd wallop you like blazes, and tache you better
                  manners!" said the young nobleman, turning on his heel and leaving the cabin.</p>
               <p>Securing the will on his person, the doctor went on deck with the captain; for the
                  latter, being now free to sail on his course again, wished to give the necessary
                  orders to do so.</p>
               <p>When they reached the deck, the piratical schooner had already filled away, and
                  was standing to the eastward; and the doctor was gratified to see that the ominous
                  colors which had fluttered at her main gaff were no longer there. He felt that
                  Andros had ordered them to be hauled down out of respect to his feelings.</p>
               <p>The pirate captain stood by the taffrail of his vessel, and waved a parting-salute
                  to the doctor with his hand, which the latter returned in a friendly manner.</p>

               <p>"What did the wretch do to you, my dear son—speak to your poor, distracted
                  mother!" cried Mrs. Mildollar, as soon as the gentlemen went on deck.</p>
               <p>"Do, <emph>do!</emph>" said the young man, bitterly. "They flogged me till I was
                  raw and bleeding like a piece of new-butchered meat, and then poured salt brine on
                  my back, and laughed while I howled in agony. Oh! curse that Gerald Andros—I'll be
                  even with him yet! And then, not satisfied with more than half-killing me with the
                  cats, he had to take an iron, red-hot, and burn a mark of shame so deep into my
                  quivering flesh, that it can never be removed! Oh! let me once get him into my
                  power! I'd not kill him—not at once; but I'd learn him how to torture. I'd show
                  him that I'd not read 'Fox's Book of Martyrs' for nothing!"</p>
               <p>"My dear, dear, dear son!"</p>
               <p>"Don't dear me any more, mother. I am a devil incarnate now! They have whipped the
                  boy out of me; and from this day on, I only live for revenge. I hate myself—hate
                  everybody."</p>
               <p>"Did you know that the old man was dead?"</p>
               <p>"Is he? Then I'm glad of it!"</p>
               <p>"But he made a will before he died?"</p>
               <p>"A will?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, a will—giving all that he had to Adelia's brat; for it appears that she had
                  a child, and it is living."</p>
               <p>"Fury! Nothing for me?"</p>
               <p>"Not a cent. He utterly ignored the existence of either you or me."</p>
               <p>"The law will not. You are entitled by that to a <emph>third</emph>."</p>
               <p>"I do not want a third. I want <emph>all</emph>—we want <emph>all</emph>, and must
                  have it. What else did I marry the old wretch for when I was in the prime and
                  ripeness of my beauty, with scores of suitors for my hand?"</p>
               <p>"How will we get all, mother?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>How</emph>, I know not; but it must be done. The will must be got hold of
                  and destroyed, then I will be his only legal heir, for Adelia was his last
                  relative."</p>
               <p>"But if the will is destroyed, the witnesses still live, and their evidence will
                  kill our claim."</p>
               <p>"They can die!" said the woman, in a hoarse whisper. "Oh! if we two could but save
                  our lives, how gladly would I see the ship sink beneath all the rest. Harry, it
                  must be done. You will be well enough to help me by the time we get upon the
                  English coast."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am well enough now for such work," said the young man, trying to rise
                  unaided.</p>
               <p>But a fearful groan told how he suffered; and it was with the utmost difficulty
                  that his mother got him to his bed, and there dressed his wounds as well as she
                  could.</p>
               <p>In this she met with but little assistance<pb n="24-25 (Illustration) "
                     xml:id="VAC6962-00000013"/> from Faralie, her maid; for the latter had heard
                  all of their late conversation, though they knew it not, and felt horror-stricken
                  at their threat to destroy the vessel and all on board but themselves.</p>
               <p>And Faralie, who for a moment was so terrified that she fortunately kept silent,
                  began to consider how she could best expose their design without injuring herself;
                  for her pay was excellent, and the chances for "stealings" very good, and she did
                  not wish to lose her situation, if all hands got safely to the shore. But to get
                  there, safely, would be out of the question, if the bold, designing woman and her
                  son, mad for revenge, could work out a plot for the destruction of the vessel, and
                  the salvation of their own persons.</p>
               <p>It did not take Faralie long to choose who should be her confidant. She was rather
                  a pretty Creole—would have been almost handsome, had not vanity and affectation
                  caused her to over-dress and put on too many airs; and had, as she well knew,
                  attracted considerable attention from the young Irish peer, who—like the most of
                  his countrymen—was an ardent admirer of the fair sex, and too general in his
                  admiration to pause long for consideration about rank or position, so long as
                  matrimony was not in view. To him, therefore, her thoughts at once reverted, as
                  the one to whom she should reveal that which she had heard.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <p>It was evening; a soft and pleasant moonlight night, and the good ship was moving
                  quietly over the trackless waters with a seven-knot breeze sleeping in the
                  swelling canvas. The doctor and Tyrconnel were enjoying, as usual, their cigars
                  and promenade on the topgallant forecastles—for smoking aft was prohibited by rule
                  as well as by their good manners—chatting over the occurrences of the morning,
                  which had been sufficiently exciting to become a general theme for conversation
                  among all on board.</p>
               <p>"When will they bury the ould gintleman d'ye think, doctor?" asked Tyrconnell.</p>
               <p>"In the morning, doubtless," replied Watson.</p>
               <p>"To-day is the sailor's bad-luck day, isn't it—a Friday—and bad luck to my late
                  memory. I ate male for dinner!" said the Irish peer, with a laugh. "Sure, Father
                  O'Dougherty will have a lecture half-a-mile long for me, when I tell him the
                  enormity of my so doing. But I may be as forgetful then as I was to-day, and—What
                  the deuce is this?"</p>
               <p>Tyrconnel's last expression was caused by seeing a small note fall at his feet,
                  apparently dropping from somewhere above; for, on looking around, they could see
                  no one, except a knot of old salts gathered around their beef-kid and teacan on
                  the spar-deck right below them.</p>
               <p>"Let it come from where it may, it's directed to me—'Lord Terrence Tyrconnel'—in a
                  most mathematical hand, considering the angular shape of the letters."</p>
               <p>"And the triangular form in which it is folded, something like a countersign in
                  garrison," added Dr. Watson. "It seemed to come from above—maybe an angel sent
                  it," he added, with a laugh.</p>
               <p>"It's from a woman—and that's the next thing to an angel," said Tyrconnel, as he
                  opened the note.</p>
               <p>"Sometimes," said Watson, dryly. "But when woman is <emph>not</emph> angelic, she
                  is apt to have a little of the devil in her disposition. But what is in the wind
                  now?—you look as if you were reading your death-warrant, instead of a love-message
                  from the disconsolate widow or her mahogany-colored maid!"</p>
               <p>"By me sowl, if there's truth in this document, it's something worth while turning
                  pale for! But it's marked <emph>confidential</emph>, and I suppose I ought to
                  hould my tongue about it—at laste, till I see the writer."</p>
               <p>"May I ask who that is?"</p>
               <p>"You may <emph>ask</emph>, doctor, but whether to answer you or not, when the
                  writer trusts to my confidence, is another thing."</p>
               <p>"Oh! do not think that I wish to intrude myself into your secrets!" said the
                  doctor, in rather a severe tone.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Intrude</emph>, did you say, doctor? INTRUDE! Sure, you didn't mane the
                  word. There's not a saycret of my own in the wide world I'd hide from you. But
                  this saycret is not my own, though it concerns you as much as it does me. But I
                  must see the writer, and then the master shall be no saycret, as far as you and I
                  are concerned."</p>
               <p>"It will be all right—don't think me offended or over-curious," said Watson.</p>
               <p>"Not a bit. But I must manage to see the writer of this note, accordin to
                  directions, though I dislike to meet the danger of a private interview with an
                  interesting faymale."</p>
               <p>With this apology, the young peer left the doctor, and was seen wending his way
                  cautiously toward the cabin, appearing anxious to avoid observation. He was absent
                  but a short time; and when he returned, his countenance showed no abatement of his
                  anxiety. Watson made no inquiries, but awaited the voluntary developments which
                  Tyrconnel might make.</p>
               <p>"The born divils!" was the first exclamation of the latter. "They're worse than
                  the Feejee Islanders."</p>
               <p>Doctor Watson smiled, but asked no question.</p>
               <p>"They ought to be hung by the heels till they were dead, <emph>dead</emph>, DEAD!
                  as the judge said when he sentenced Phelim O'Brien to death for killing a
                  gintleman without timely warning of the same. And then God ought <emph>not</emph>
                  to have mercy on their sowls!"</p>
               <p>Still, to the evident annoyance of Tyrconnel, the doctor asked no question.</p>
               <p>

               <p>"Just to think what they'd be afther doing, and all the same with them that have
                  worked 'em no harm, as with them that have," continued Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>The doctor paid no heed even to this remark; but taking out a fresh cigar,
                  proceeded to light it at the stump of the old one.</p>
               <p>"What the deuce is the matter with ye, doctor?" said the peer, nervously.</p>
               <p>"Nothing," said the doctor, quietly.</p>
               <p>"Nothing? It's nothing ye'll say, and nothing ye'll ask, when you can see I'm
                  almost burstin' with a saycret."</p>
               <p>"You chose to conceal your secret, at first, and I certainly shall not ask you to
                  divulge it now."</p>
               <p>"But I will—by me sowl, I will! The saycret's too heavy for me to kape all by
                  myself."</p>
               <p>"Then out with it," said the doctor, with a laugh.</p>
               <p>"That ould catamaran—that ould she-wolf in petticoats below, and her cub, are
                  plotting to destroy the ship and all on board but their own two cursed selves, as
                  soon as we get on the English coast, so that the ould man's will and witnesses
                  will be out the way, and they can go back and inherit his property."</p>
               <p>"Is that all?" asked the doctor, quietly.</p>
               <p>"Is that <emph>all</emph>—ye omadhoun? Isn't that enough? By me sowl, doctor, you
                  take it as cool as if ye were asked to take off a leg."</p>
               <p>"What is the use of taking it otherwise? If we know their intentions, it will be
                  easy to thwart them. But how did you learn this important news?"</p>
               <p>"Why, the French girl, with a bit o' the nagur in her blood, has been lookin'
                  rather swate at me for a few days past; and for the fun o' the thing, I gave back
                  look for look, with a thrifle of interest, maybe. And so she thought I'd be a
                  better friend in throuble, maybe, than anybody else on board; and so she tould me,
                  wid horror in her accents, and love in her eyes, that she'd overheard the ould
                  Jezebel and her son planning to destroy the vessel and all on board but
                  themselves, as soon as we made the English coast."</p>
               <p>"Then, knowing this much, all we have to do is, to acquaint the captain of the
                  plot, and get him to put the two intended criminals under arrest, from the moment
                  we make land until they are safe upon it."</p>
               <p>"Faith, you've hit it, doctor! That was just what I thought 'twas best to do; and
                  I tould the French girl with the little drop o' nagur blood in her veins, if she
                  lost her situation, I'd put her in a better one!"</p>
               <p>"You didn't hint that you'd make her Lady Tyrconnel, did you?"</p>
               <p>"Doctor, jokin' is jokin', and I can give and take a joke as well as any man that
                  wears boots; but, by my soul, if any other man had said as much as you did then,
                  he should measure ten paces wid me before he slept, and see how well he could
                  shoot at the distance! The blood of the Tyrconnels is thicker than water, but it's
                  as pure and as free; and so it has been since the days of Tyr Tyrconnel the
                  king—and so it shall be till Terrence Tyrconnel is under the sod! D'ye think I'd
                  demane myself wid mingling my blood with that of a French quarter-nagur? Doctor,
                  it's well ye wasn't a consultin'-physician in the case o' Job! He'd never have
                  stood the test. He'd have cursed his Maker and died, if <emph>you'd</emph> been
                  there to taze him!"</p>
               <p>"I meant nothing serious in my remark," said Watson, smiling at the earnestness of
                  the other.</p>
               <p>"Didn't ye, now? Well, it's a consolation to hear you say so, doctor dear! And
                  now, if it's no ways inconvaynient, let us go below and tip the jug up a bit, and
                  see if the crater wouldn't make us both feel aisier in our minds."</p>
               <p>To this proposition the good-natured physician made no objections; and they at
                  once proceeded to carry it into effect.</p>

                  the body to them given; the awe-stricken and silent crew, standing, hat in hand,
                  while their chief reads the funeral-service—<emph>they</emph> are there; and make
                  a funeral at sea more striking to a thoughtful mind than all the pomp and show of
                  one on shore.</p>
               <p>On the morning after his death, the body of Richard Mildollar, swathed in folds of
                  canvas, was brought on deck for burial; for his widow made no request for its
                  preservation, and let the blunt old captain have his own way in regard to it.</p>
               <p>When it was brought up, with some show of decency, she and her son appeared with
                  mourning on their forms, and handkerchiefs held to their tearless faces; but
                  scarce a sigh, or even a hypocritical sob, could they get up while Captain Jones
                  read the funeral-service; and though a cold shudder ran through many a frame, as
                  the sullen plunge of the weighted corpse into the sea was heard, no quiver of
                  feeling did they exhibit.</p>
               <p>"Well, I'm glad it's over—by me soul I am! for I couldn't feel aisy with a dead
                  man aboord!" said Tyrconnel to Watson, after all hands had left the gangway, and
                  Mrs. Mildollar had gone below, assisting her half-crippled son.</p>
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6962-00000015"/>
               <p>"Why not?" asked the doctor.</p>
               <p>"I've a wakeness about dead folks that I can't got over: and it all comes from my
                  old nurse, Norah Mitchell—bad luck to the only eye left in her head! She used to
                  be always telling me ghost stories, when I was a brat of a boy, till she got me so
                  skittish, that my shadow by moonlight would make me lape over a seven-barred gate.
                  The little sense I got by nature tells me it's foolish to be bothered with such
                  thoughts; but I can no more help it than I can help makin' love to a purty girl,
                  when a cruel fate sets me by the side of one."</p>
               <p>"I hardly thought the widow would show herself on deck," said the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Faith, she's like an ould, neglected garden—proud of her <emph>weeds!</emph>"
                  said Tyrconnel. "And it's likely, as she hated the ould gintleman so sincerely,
                  that she wanted to be sure he was put out of the way where he couldn't come to
                  again to bother her. And now, doctor, since she's got her mind aisy of him, we'd
                  better be lookin' to ourselves; for she has sworn to get the will, and all who saw
                  it signed, out of the way—so my little French girl with the nagur blood in her
                  veins tells me."</p>
               <p>"I shall take good care of the will and my own person," said the doctor. "And with
                  God's help. I'll see it executed; and I know that Captain Jones will aid me to the
                  best of his power."</p>
               <p>"To be sure I will, doctor; but in what I don't know yet, till I learn the drift
                  of your conversation," said the individual just alluded to, joining the two
                  passengers.</p>
               <p>"I was speaking of Mildollar's will, and my determination to see it executed to
                  the last letter in favor of the helpless child of poor Adelia Mildollar."</p>
               <p>"You shall surely have my aid there. Do you anticipate any trouble about it?"</p>
               <p>"All that the she-dragon now in the cabin can give us."</p>
               <p>"I wish she was overboard!"</p>
               <p>"Amen! and that ould Satan had her by the tongue; for there he'd find the best
                  hould to kape her fast by," said Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"You had better inform the captain of your newly-discovered secret," said the
                  doctor.</p>
               <p>"Do it yourself, doctor dear. You're more glib with your tongue than I, without
                  I've an extra drop of the cratur aboord, or am so wretched as to have a purty girl
                  where I can't get away from her."</p>
               <p>The doctor smiled, and briefly informed the captain of the matter which had come
                  to light through Faralie.</p>
               <p>"They shall be watched—closely watched; and at the first open sign of their
                  intention to do injury to the ship or us, they shall both know the comforts of
                  double irons," said Captain Jones. "I'd confine them now; but without more proof
                  against <emph>them</emph>, they might make a suit lie against <emph>me</emph> for
                  false imprisonment; and I'd rather lose five years' wages than get into the
                  clutches of an English court. One is chiseled by everybody he comes in contact
                  with—from the Lord Judge on the Queen's Bench, down to the scullion that blacks
                  the jailor's boots. A friend of mine was sued, in Liverpool, for slapping the face
                  of a cockney tape-and-needle-seller who had insulted his only daughter, who had
                  taken the voyage with him; and before he got through with the law-sharks, it cost
                  him over five thousand dollars."</p>
               <p>"And what became of the cockney?" asked Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"He set up in business for himself on the damages he received, and rides in his
                  carriage now, I expect."</p>
               <p>"Sure, if it had been my daughter he insulted, I'd have given him a free ride to
                  the burying-ground, before he had a chance to go to law. A slap in the face is no
                  equivalent for an insult to a lady, without you know that the pistols will be sure
                  to be called for. Then it does very well for a gentale beginning, I think," said
                  Tyrconnel. "And now, captain, dear," he continued, "if it so plazes you, be silent
                  as to the news you've just got, and where it comes from; for the French girl with
                  nagur blood in her veins is a timersome craychure!"</p>
               <p>"I shall be silent and cautious," said the captain. "And now, gentlemen, if you'll
                  adjourn to my state-room, we will test the quality of some 'old rye' that I have
                  there."</p>
               <p>"The 'spirit moves me,' as the Quaker said to a half-emptied bottle, which stood
                  before him like a monument to the Queen of Sheba," said Tyrconnel, who seldom
                  needed a second invitation to oil the channel of his throat.</p>
               <p>He was, like the most of his countrymen ready for everything that had fun or
                  enjoyment in it—ready for a drink, a dance, or a fight—ready to quarrel, and as
                  ready to make up again—ready to flirt with a beauty; and though he lost his heart
                  a dozen times a year, could always find it when he wanted it again. He was a true
                  type of the better class of Irishmen.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <p>It was the twenty-second day out; and for that era, the sight of the English coast
                  in twenty-two days after leaving New York, was a matter to brag of, and for much
                  newspaper comment—the passage being shorter, in proportion to advantages, than a
                  nine days' steamer-trip now. It was early in the afternoon of the twenty-second
                  day, as I said before; and a man from the foretopgallant yard had just sung out
                  that cheeriest of all cries on shipboard—except in a gale—"Land, ho!"</p>
               <p>And the captain, with an activity among the ropes which was astonishing for one of
                  his years, had sprung aloft with his spy-glass slung over his shoulder; and now
                  came down, with a pleasant face, saying that he'd seen the "Lizard"; and then he
                  gave the helmsman a course for the "Channel," and told the chief mate to trim the
                  sails so that everything would draw.</p>
               <p>The cry of "land, ho!" had brought every passenger on deck; and among them came
                  the widow and her son—a thing so unusual, that almost every eye was turned upon
                  them. For young Corryell had made but two visits to the deck since the burial of
                  Mildollar; and on both of those occasions, had been greeted by a singular mewing
                  of cats from various forward parts of the ship; and the allusion to his late
                  punishment was so pointed, that he could not face it. His mother, out of sympathy
                  for him, and hatred for all the rest on board, had kept to the cabin with him,
                  where their meals were supplied; for their company was not desirable to any one
                  else on board.</p>
               <p>But now, at the cry of "land, ho!" they came out from their retirement, and
                  strained their eyes to look on the shore; but, as yet, it could be seen only from
                  the mast-head.</p>
               <p>"How far are we from the shore, Captain Jones?" asked Mrs. Mildollar, in a tone
                  intended to be <emph>very</emph> gracious.</p>
               <p>"Between twenty and thirty miles, ma'am!" said the captain, rather gruffly, but
                  not with precise disrespect.</p>
               <p>"How long will it be before we reach London?" asked young Corryell.</p>
               <p>"We may never reach there!" said Jones, looking him keenly in the eye. "Some one
                  may bore holes in the bottom of the ship, or set fire to the twenty kegs of powder
                  stowed in the after-part of the hold, or—What is the matter with <emph>you</emph>?
                  You look more pale than you did after Gerald Andros got through with you!"</p>
               <p>"I'm sick, mother—let us go below," said the young wretch, who, in turning from
                  the gaze of the captain, found the eyes of Watson and Tyrconnel both fixed upon
                  him with looks of suspicion, too strong for him to doubt. He felt in an instant
                  that they knew all, and that whatever plan or plans he and his mother had made, or
                  might make, on board the ship, would be frustrated.</p>
               <p>"And when you go below, young man, you had better stay there until this ship casts
                  her anchor in port. If you come on deck, you <emph>may</emph> fall overboard. I
                  think your health will be best if you keep your berth; and your mother's, also, if
                  she stays there to nurse you, and does nothing else!" said Captain Jones,
                  pointedly.</p>
               <p>"The impertinence of your advice is equal to its want of necessity!" said Mrs.
                  Mildollar, haughtily, as she turned to the cabin ladder, and quickly
                  disappeared.</p>
               <p>"I hope that warning will suffice—if not, stronger measures shall be adopted!"
                  said Captain Jones. Then calling to his chief mate, he said: "Mr. Marston, I wish
                  you would detail a gang of three men, to relieve each other every three hours, to
                  act as sentinels at the best cabin door. Send me trusty men, and I will give them
                  their directions!"</p>
               <p>"Ay, ay, sir!" said the mate; and he went forward to execute the order.</p>
               <p>The wind was now fresh from the southward and eastward, and the good ship bowled
                  along right merrily, under as much canvas as her spars could well bear.</p>
               <p>"How long, with such a breeze, will it take us to run in?" asked Watson, of the
                  captain.</p>
               <p>"If it lasts as it is, not much, if any, over twenty-four hours," said the
                  captain. "The ship has run ahead of all my expectations. But I don't like the
                  looks of the weather. There is a heavy bank off to the south'ard, which has been
                  rising fast for twenty minutes. If the wind hauls around due south, we shall have
                  more than a capful of it. The worst of it will be, that 'twill blow dead on shore;
                  and if we cannot carry sail to haul off with, we will have a rough lee of it. But
                  I shall make Eddystone light, by dark; and if I find the wind hauling any more,
                  I'll stretch over toward the Guernsey Shore! But we'll hope for better luck."</p>
               <p>"Come to my state-room," said Tyrconnel. "Come, doctor; you know there's welcome
                  there."</p>
               <p>"All our chances are lost!" said Harry Corryell, as he entered the cabin with his
                  mother. "In some way they have overheard our plans, and now a watch will be kept
                  upon us, and we can do nothing!"</p>
               <p>"Nothing on board, it is true! But let us get on shore once, and if they escape
                  us, neither wit nor money are worth much in England!" replied his mother.</p>
               <p>"Money, mother? How much money have you?"</p>
               <p>"About ten thousand, that I have saved up; and I've secured the old man's
                  pocket-book, with money and drafts to nearly double that amount!"</p>
               <p>"Jupiter and Mars! Why, we can have a jolly good time in London, after all!"</p>
               <p>"Before you think of 'jolly good times,' sir, it seems to me you had better aid me
                  in my plans to destroy the will and witnesses, so that we can secure a fortune
                  which will enable us to do as we please afterward. I should think that such an
                  insult as you have just received, would rouse in you a spirit of revenge too
                  strong to sleep, while the insulter lived!"</p>
               <p>"I shall not forget it, mother—you need not fear that. With such a fund at our
                  command, it seems to me we can almost do as we like in a city like London. I could
                  get twenty throats cut for half the amount, in New York, And London can't be much
                  of a city, if money can't work as well there!"</p>
               <p>"Hush! speak low, my son! We do not know who is listening—there are so many
                  spy-holes about a ship, which we do not understand. We will say nothing, nor will
                     we<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6962-00000016"/> attempt anything until we get on
                  shore. It will not be safe for us to try it; for it is evident that we have no
                  friends on board, except our servants!"</p>
               <p>"That's so; and I doubt whether they're to be trusted. We must be on our guard
                  against every one!"</p>
               <p>The entrance of the steward, to prepare their table for supper, put an end to this
                  interesting conversation.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
               <p>Night came on, dark and tempestuous; and every seaman of the watch on board the
                  Merlin drew his sou'-wester down firmly on his head as he looked to the windward,
                  and buttoned his jacket close about his form; for he knew that, in nautical
                  parlance, 'twould "blow great guns" before his watch was out.</p>
               <p>Eddystone light had just been made on the lee bow, and the vessel was staggering
                  on under her topsails and coursers, with as much as she could stand up under at
                  that.</p>
               <p>"You had better send down the royal and top-gallant yards, and house their masts,
                  Mr. Marston!" said Captain Jones. "You may as well call all hands to do it, for
                  we'll have to reef topsails soon. We must haul up off the land more, or we'll be
                  atop of it before morning!"</p>
               <p>"Ay, that we will sir—the wind is a little to the eastward of south, and we've not
                  got half the strength of it yet!"</p>
               <p>"That's so! Hurry up the men and get the ship snug as soon as you can. An extra
                  tot of grog will nimble them some, perhaps. Try it, at any rate."</p>
               <p>"Ay, ay, sir!" And the officer hastened <choice>
                     <sic>to to</sic>
                     <corr>to</corr>
                  </choice> obey his orders.</p>
               <p>Although very early yet, the night was so pitchy dark, that with the exception of
                  the phosphorescent glare of the foam on the huge waves close aboard, and the red,
                  shimmering, star-like appearance of the lantern on Eddy-stone, nothing could be
                  seen a hand's-breadth beyond the ship. But sailors know where to place their hands
                  as well in the dark as in daylight, on board ship. They can haul out an earring or
                  tie a reef-knot full as well—know where and how every rope leads where the masts
                  fid—when to hoist and when to lower; and so far as duty is concerned, can work in
                  the darkness as well as in the light: thereby imitating some heroic
                  philanthropists, who often do good and Christian actions, though not themselves
                  within the pale of holy Church: and doing them all as soulfully as professors of
                  that creed which sends the children of the same Father to antipodes of bliss and
                  damnation in the next world.</p>
               <p>The seamen, cheered on by the "extra nip," and the voices of officers whom they
                  liked, worked with a will; and soon the taut upper spars of the Merlin were on
                  deck, or housed aloft, and the sail reduced to double reefed topsails and whole
                  courses, forward and aft.</p>
               <p>But as the captain gave her a course which laid her head more off the coast, and
                  brought her nearly on a close-hauled bowline, she had all that she could stagger
                  under, and pitched into the ugly Channel-sea with a spitefulness which made every
                  timber quiver and creak.</p>
               <p>"How does she weather it, captain?" asked Watson, an hour or two later, as he
                  crept up alongside of Jones, who—wrapped in his tarpaulin sea-clothes and hooded
                  in his south-wester, stood holding on to one of the guards of the binnacle,
                  anxiously watching the compass. The glare of the binnacle-light falling on his
                  care-worn and anxious face, and on the two stout seamen who had all they could do
                  to keep the ship steady with the wheel, and on the face of the good doctor, who,
                  in lieu of his hat, which he could not keep on his head, had tied a red bandanna
                  there, while the spray was dashing over them, and the wind straightening out every
                  hair it reached—all of this formed quite a picture; such a one as many an artist
                  would joy to catch, if he could but get the opportunity. Expression, attitude,
                  deep shadows, and perilous position, all combined.</p>
               <p>"How does she weather it, captain?" again asked the doctor; for he was not
                  understood by the old man when he first spoke, such was the turmoil of wind and
                  water.</p>
               <p>"None too well, doctor—none too well! She's too sharp for this head sea, without
                  flare enough forward to lift her over the rollers. She buries and sags to leeward.
                  I've been in hopes I could get over under the lee of Jersey or Guernsey, but the
                  wind keeps hauling more to the east'ard; and I'm afeard we'll have it rougher yet
                  before morning! But say nothing to the passengers—I don't want them alarmed. I can
                  take care of the ship a blessed sight easier than I can take care of scared men
                  and women!"</p>
               <p>"Do not fear. This is not my first storm at sea," said the doctor, quietly.</p>
               <p>"Hold hard, or 'twill be your last!" said the captain, quickly, as a huge sea came
                  toppling in over the weather-bow, threatening to sweep all before it. And at the
                  same instant that it poured its torrent over the drenched decks, a dark form was
                  seen struggling in the foam which swept past the cabin door, and was bearing it
                  over the lee quarter, when the doctor, holding fast by a guy-rope which held the
                  spanker-boom to its place, reached out and grasped it. A confused sputtering out
                  of words and salt water were heard, as the doctor drew the form toward him; and
                  when, after the sea had passed to leeward, the form regained its feet and power to
                  talk, Watson was delighted to find that he had saved his friend, Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"Doctor, dear, you've saved my life, by the powers! and it's meself that's a
                  thousand times obliged to ye for the same! But will you answer me a scientific
                  question?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly; but this is neither a very good time nor place for scientific
                  discussion."</p>
               <p>"Don't you consider me a patient under hydropathic treatment?"</p>
               <p>"You bear the application of water very cheerfully," replied Watson, with a
                  laugh.</p>
               <p>"Was that a regular <emph>douche</emph>, or only a bit of a
                  <emph>wash?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"It came near washing you overboard."</p>
               <p>"But they say, 'a miss is as good as a mile,' doctor, dear; and a handsome miss is
                  a hape better than a mile, if you walk the distance in her company. But, I say,
                  doctor, do you think salt water is good for the stomach?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sometimes. It acts purgingly, and as an emetic."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Purgingly?</emph> By the powers, it's as bitter as <emph>purgatory;</emph>
                  and I shouldn't wonder at its quality. Don't you think a dose of good brandy would
                  rectify it?"</p>
               <p>"In your case, I think sixty drops of brandy might be prescribed with safety,"
                  said the doctor.</p>
               <p>"And I'll not <emph>pro</emph>scribe the size o' the drops—the bigger the better,
                  as Phelim. O'Toole said, when he heard that Barney Mucklave, the ould Crœsus, of
                  Dublin, would give his daughters their weight in gould for a dowry!"</p>
               <p>With a little more care than he had used when he came on deck, Tyrconnel now
                  retreated toward the cabin, followed by the doctor; for he had insisted upon the
                  latter supervising the mixing and effect of the proposed medicine—suggesting a
                  thing almost unheard of: that the doctor should swallow a portion of his own
                  prescription.</p>
               <p>If such were the universal practice among the medical faculty, there would be more
                  drugs in the world, and not so many doctors, in a little while.</p>

               <p>The night passed away, but the weather did not improve; and the anxious old
                  skipper still remained at his post, which he had not left during the long, weary
                  hours of darkness. The wind had risen so that he had been obliged to furl the
                  courses and close-reef the topsails; and now, under the latter three, and the fore
                  storm-stay-sail, the ship was doing all she could. But, as he had told the doctor
                  the night before, her build, though it "told" for speed in smoother water, was too
                  sharp, and lacked "bearings" for a rough sea. She made but little headway, and her
                  leeway was immense.</p>
               <p>"If she drags off this way, we'll see rocks before night," said Captain Jones, in
                  a low tone, to his mate, as he drank off a glass of hot rum-toddy, for which he
                  had just sent.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, I'd rather see them in the daytime than the night, if we
                     <emph>have</emph> to see them! If we knew exactly where we were, we might run
                  down for a harbor. There's Plymouth somewhere under our lee, I expect!"</p>
               <p>"Maybe, yes; but all as likely, if we were to run off, we'd see the Bill of
                  Portland, or Saint Alban's Head, or some other place to butt the ship's brains out
                  on."</p>
               <p>"I'd not care if we made Saint Alban's Head. We could find a lee then behind the
                  Isle of Wight."</p>
               <p>"Yes, if we had a pilot on board; but 'tis a rocky region to venture into without
                  one."</p>
               <p>"I think I'd risk my knowledge there, sir. I was shipped, for a year or more, in a
                  yacht that used to cruise about there; and I don't think I've forgotten much of
                  what I learned in them days."</p>
               <p>"Well, we may have to trust to your knowledge, Mr. Marston. You can take charge of
                  the deck, while I go below to get a bite of breakfast."</p>
               <p>While this conversation was going on between the captain and the mate, a more
                  interesting one was being carried on by Mrs. Mildollar's <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >femme de chambre</foreign> and Lord Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>The poor girl, terrified dreadfully by the plunging of the ship, had come up from
                  below, and now clung to the weather-side of the ship, just forward of the
                  mainmast, where Tyrconnel had fixed himself to enjoy a cigar.</p>
               <p>"O mi lord," said she, in broken English, "is not zis ver dangereuse? Will we
                  evare see ze land once more?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, my girl—providing the salt spray don't wash the eyesight away from
                  us."</p>
               <p>"Oh! how my head sweems!"</p>
               <p>"No fear of your body sinking, if your head swims."</p>
               <p>"O mi lord, how can you be so foony when zere is so much of ze danger?"</p>
               <p>"It's the nature of me, my girl. I expect to joke with the praste or doctor when I
                  am dying. They say, the first thing I did when I was born, was to pull my father
                  by the nose! The ould gentleman was delighted when I did it; for he said I was the
                  true Tyrconnel stock, who'd pull the nose of anybody that insulted them. And as he
                  had just made a remark derogatory to my complexion, he concluded that I took it as
                  an insult."</p>
               <p>"Ah, ha, you are <emph>so</emph> foony, mi lord. Do you remembare when you was
                  born?"</p>
               <p>"Not exactly; but I've an indistinct remembrance of a row at my christening. How
                  does the ould catamaran below and her son get on?"</p>
               <p>"Zey are very still, mi lord. Zey suspect zat ze capitan 'have discovare all, and
                  zey will be circumspect until zey get to ze shore. Zen zey will try to do zeir
                  best to do zeir worst. Zey are bad peoples. I shall be glad when I shall be wiz
                  zem no more."</p>
               <p>"I hope, Mam'selle Faralie, you'll stay with them for a while—at least, until the
                  doctor is ready to embark for America again; for only<pb n="32-33 (Illustration) "
                     xml:id="VAC6962-00000017"/> through you can we know of their plans, and prepare
                  to thwart them."</p>
               <p>"Whatevare mi lord desire poor Faralie to do, zat she will do. Her life is at his
                  disposal!" said the warm-blooded Creole; and her great black eyes told that indeed
                  she would be willing to lay down her life for him; for life and love, with most of
                  her people and class, are but one.</p>
               <p>"And for fear that our intimate acquaintance should become known to the ould
                  catamaran, our interviews ought not to be frequent," said Tyrconnel. "But you can
                  write, and let me know of anything new, without attracting so much attention."</p>
               <p>"May I write to mi lord whenever I desire?" asked Faralie.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, my dear."</p>
               <p>"Ah, zat permissione shall make me very happy—very much content; and I will now go
                  to my room. But, mi lord, if ze sheep shall sink, will you remembare poor
                  Faralie?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure I will, and save you, or perish in trying!" said the warm-hearted
                  peer.</p>
               <p>"Ah, I sank you, mi lord—I sank you very much!" and the young Creole, with a
                  tear-drop, glittering like a pearl in ebon setting, in either eye, left him, and
                  went into the cabin.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
               <p>As the day wore on, the wind increased; and by noon, the captain, sadly against
                  his will, was obliged to take in his topsails, and put the ship under a
                  close-reefed spanker, main and fore staysail—for he dared not heave her to with
                  the shore so close under his lee as he knew it must be. Often, during the day,
                  either he or the chief-mate was seen to go as high as the main-top, and there to
                  look with the glass to leeward; and as often as they did so without seeing land,
                  the very cheerfulness of their looks told it, without a word being uttered.</p>
               <p>It was an hour or two after noon, when the captain and chief mate—having been
                  below to dine, leaving the second mate in charge—came on deck, that a man who had
                  been sent to the foremast-head to secure the lashings of the topsail-yard, which
                  had been placed as an extra security to the "slings," came aft to the captain, and
                  said, in a low tone:</p>
               <p>"There's land dead ahead, sir. I thought you might not like to have everybody know
                  it; so I didn't sing out."</p>
               <p>"You did right, George—very right. Go to the steward, and tell him to give you a
                  glass of my best brandy."</p>
               <p>"Ay, ay, sir—thank you, sir."</p>
               <p>"Stop a moment, George. Could you see no land on the lee bow, nor abeam?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir; not a sign of it."</p>
               <p>"Very well. Go and get your grog, and keep still about what you've seen."</p>
               <p>"Ay, ay, sir."</p>
               <p>"What land do you think it is, sir?" asked Marston.</p>
               <p>"Prasole Point. It can't be anything else, to be ahead of us while we are on this
                  course."</p>
               <p>"And we are drifting down bodily into the rocky bight to the westward of it."</p>
               <p>"Precisely."</p>
               <p>"Wouldn't it be better to wear, and try to head off on the other tack?"</p>
               <p>"That would bring Eddystone, and the cursed rocks thereabouts, under our lee. We
                  must put more canvas on her, and weather the point."</p>
               <p>"She'll not stand it, sir!"</p>
               <p>"She must—or <emph>drag</emph> it!" said the captain. "Call all hands to splice
                  the main-brace, and then get the topsails on her one by one—beginning aft, so as
                  to make her hug up to the wind all she can."</p>
               <p>"Ay, ay, sir," said the mate; and while he hastened to execute these orders, the
                  captain quietly went aloft, with his glass, to examine the new danger.</p>
               <p>He saw, the moment that his eye caught the point, that he was right as to the
                  locality, and when he also observed that the vessel, luffing as much as possible,
                  could only head about four or five points to windward of the rocky promontory,
                  then not more than sixteen or eighteen miles ahead, his heart almost sunk within
                  him; for, once fairly embayed to the westward of the point, where there was no
                  harbor or safe anchorage to be found, he knew that his case would be
                  desperate.</p>
               <p>"Keep her a good, clean full, and let her go through the water!" said he to the
                  helmsman, as he came aft and looked at the compass once more.</p>
               <p>By this time the men had got their grog, and were busy in sheeting home and
                  hoisting the mizzen topsail. They rather wondered at the skipper's apparent
                  rashness in carrying so much sail—for he had the reputation of being careful—but
                  the wonder of sailors at anything done by their superior is generally locked
                  within their own breasts, and they obey orders without questioning the wisdom of
                  those who give them.</p>
               <p>The gale was so strong, that it took the whole force of the vessel over an hour to
                  get the three topsails reefed as they were set—a work which in moderate times
                  would not have occupied ten minutes. And when the canvas was on her, being kept
                  full, the ship made more head and less lee way; but she plunged fearfully into the
                  tremendous sea—seeming at times as if she would pitch the spars bodily out of her,
                  or that they would strain and rend the creaking hull apart. But on she went,
                  diving into the sea and throwing the spray higher than her tops, while the men
                  clung to the standing rigging and rails, shaking themselves like dripping
                  water-dogs as the ship rose from her successive drenchings, and bearing<figure>

                  <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6962-00000018"/> ing their duckings with that good-humor
                  which almost always characterizes the sailor, while <emph>grog</emph> and
                     <emph>gruel</emph> is plenty, and he meets with <emph>kindness</emph> from his
                  officers.</p>
               <p>Not a more enduring, patient-under-hardship, obedient, or daring set of men can be
                  found in the world, than seamen, if they have the three italicized articles
                  above-mentioned. When you hear of a mutiny on board ship, you can, as a general
                  thing, know that it is the result of official tyranny there, or else of a
                  parsimony on the part of owners which forces on the poor men scant or unwholesome
                  food. As one who has served and commanded both in the naval and mercantile marine,
                  the writer speaks from positive knowledge of such matters, and not from hearsay
                  through a dull landsman's ear. But this is not my story, though <emph>it</emph>
                  leads to occasional digressions.</p>
               <p>Not more than an hour or an hour and a half after sail had been made on the ship,
                  the bold, rough headland was in full sight from deck. And the ship had weathered
                  even better than the captain had hoped, for with a clean full in her sails she
                  made less lee-way; and as the point still lay under the lee-bow, he hoped to clear
                  it if he could keep the canvas on his craft. The staunch old commander stood
                  quietly by the helmsmen, watching now the compass, then the weather-lift of the
                  sails, then squinting away to leeward to see how the land lay.</p>
               <p>"Will she go by, sir?" asked the mate, who had been forward, getting up
                  relieving-tackles to ease the strain on the spars.</p>
               <p>"As much as ever, but I think she'll <emph>do</emph> it!" was the reply. "Luff
                  there"—(to the helmsmen)—"luff when the gale freshens, and ease her a little when
                  it lulls!"</p>
               <p>The sight now began to be as grand as it was painfully interesting. The great gray
                  rocky point lifted its adamantine head high in air, but scarcely so high that the
                  foam from the monster waves which broke along its base, did not reach the top.
                  Every eye on board was fixed on the peril—every heart was almost hushed in its
                  throbbings, as each moment brought them nearer to the danger. Even Mrs. Mildollar
                  and her graceless cub had come on deck; and pale, trembling and breathless, they
                  stood with the rest, as the ship dashed on closer and closer to the point.</p>
               <p>Calm in appearance, but in truth fearfully anxious in his deep responsibility, the
                  captain stood by the lee-helm: for he had grasped the wheel himself, and
                  calculated the chances. The roar of the breakers now sounded louder than the gale,
                  and a few moments would seal their fate—they would be safe or lost; for there was
                  no hope for a single life if the ship should strike.</p>
               <p>On she plunged—the point was almost passed, when the face of the high rock seemed
                  to beat back the gale, and the canvas flapped idly against the spars.</p>
               <p>"God have mercy on us—we are lost!" groaned the brave captain.</p>
               <p>"God have mercy on us—we are lost!" was the moan of many a heart.</p>
               <p>The wild jagged rocks—the seething breakers were before them. <emph>Death</emph>
                  was there, with his great raven wings hanging cloud-like above them.</p>
               <p>A monster wave lifted the helpless ship toward the rocks; she was almost upon
                  them, when some strong, unseen power seemed to slide her back from them; another
                  wave lifted her in; but again she slid back, and the next wave hove her clear of
                  the point and beyond it.</p>
               <p>"Thank God for the under-tow—ha! ha! ha! Thank God for the under-tow!" screamed
                  the captain, and he fell senseless on the deck of the vessel; for with the peril
                  passed his strength also.</p>
               <p>It was true; the strong under-tow had alone saved them from a fearful fate: and
                  now the ship, with wind enough to again give her headway, forged ahead with a
                  clear sea before her—heading a course which would take her under the lee of the
                  Isle of Wight, if the gale made it necessary to run in. Doctor Watson had the
                  captain carried below, where he could properly attend to him; while Mr. Marston
                  gave the vessel a course, and looked over the chart to see what harbor he could
                  now make, if the storm did not abate.</p>
               <p>And the crow and the passengers still remained silent; for the peril of death had
                  been so imminent, that its memory clung like a wintry shadow unto them.</p>

               <p>"Well, doctor dear, here we are at 'Mynert's'—here in the great city of London at
                  last, and the dangers of the salt, salt say are over!" said Tyrconnel, just one
                  week later than the events narrated in our last chapter.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I am heartily glad of it!" said Watson. "If poor Jones was only well, I
                  should be happier!"</p>
               <p>"Isn't he past all danger, doctor dear?"</p>
               <p>"All danger of death is over—immediate death at least. But I fear that it will be
                  long before his reason is completely restored. That was a terrible shock for him,
                  and strange, too, in one who had been used to danger from his boyhood! But I hope
                  he will soon come around. I have given orders to have him brought to our hotel,
                  where I can more constantly attend to him, and he will be more comfortable than on
                  board ship!"</p>
               <p>"That's a good idea, and like the kind heart that bates in your bosom, doctor
                  dear!"</p>
               <p>"Have you heard where the she-dragon and her whelp have put up yet?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—I got a note an hour ago from my little French girl with the nagur blood in
                  her veins. And singular as it may seem, the ould catamaran, whom you call a
                  she-dragon, has<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6962-00000019"/> put up at the "St George
                  and Dragon," feeling a liking for the baste's last name, most likely!"</p>
               <p>"Does she speak of returning to America?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, she spakes of it, but you know when a woman spakes one thing, she almost
                  always manes another!"</p>
               <p>"Poh, friend Terrence, I am astonished to hear you talk of the sex in that way. I
                  thought you were almost a woman-worshiper!"</p>
               <p>"Not so bad as that, doctor dear—not so bad as that, quite. Not to deny a small
                  likin' I have for the swate craychures, but it's for their very contradictions I
                  like 'em! If one of 'em says she hates the sight o' me, I know she don't—if she
                  says she doesn't care a mite for me, I know she almost loves the ground I tread
                  upon—if I'm tazing her and she bids me desist, the word is on her tongue, but the
                  laugh in her eye gives it the lie! Och, if it wasn't for her contradictions, a
                  woman wouldn't be worth the time a man spends with her!"</p>
               <p>"Well, you may be partially right!" said the doctor with a laugh.</p>
               <p>"Well, if I'm partially right, it's full allowance for an Irishman!"</p>
               <p>"When will you leave for your estates?" continued the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Not while that ould catamaran is in your vicinity, doctor! I've a boding that
                  she'll try to give you trouble; and Terrence Tyrconnel is the boy that wouldn't be
                  absent from you in that hour for a ship-load of yellow goold. When your business
                  is done, and you're safe-shipped for America, and beyond the ould hyena's reach,
                  I'll feel continted, and turn my head toward my home in ould Killarney: Till then,
                  I'm your shadow, doctor! Not a word—I'm as deaf as an adder to anything you say
                  against it!"</p>
               <p>"I am sure I shall not oppose you in your kind intentions!" said the doctor.
                  "Although I do not fear the machinations of Mrs. Mildollar, I value your company
                  as much as I would that of a brother!"</p>
               <p>"Faith, you're more than a brother to me. You're a brother and a mother to boot!
                  But excuse me a bit, doctor—I must go and write a note to the little French girl
                  with the nagur blood in her veins. It won't do to neglect her, for she's a spy on
                  the enemy you see!"</p>
               <p>And with this excuse the worthy young peer left the room, whistling
                  "Erin-go-Bragh," as he went.</p>

               <p>No city in the world, not even the Gomorrah of America, New York, can vie with
                  London in its number of low and infamous dens—in its dark and dangerous corners.
                  To prove that, we have but to accept the statements of Dickens, Reynolds, and
                  others—to read about "Saint Giles" and a host of other purlieus as bad. New York
                  has its "Five Points" and "Hook," or rather <emph>had</emph> them—for the "Points"
                  are now anything but dangerous, and the "Hook" has been civilized. And from the
                  specimens who come over to teach the art of burglary, picking pockets, etc.,
                  London can probably show up as expert a gang of villains as any other city in the
                  world. Mark you, we take her own writers for witnesses, and rely upon their
                  evidence, which has been voluminously given.</p>
               <p>But this is only prefatory to a scene on which we are about to raise the dramatic
                  curtain of the story.</p>
               <p>In one of the many smoky kennels of Saint Giles, a dark and dreary tap-room,
                  redolent of the smell of bad gin and worse tobacco, and lighted miserably—some
                  halt dozen rough looking persons were seated by a greasy table in front of the
                  bar, playing cards. Long pipes were in their mouths, and glasses before them,
                  which were filled, when emptied, from a black bottle, which stood near at
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"I'm three times, cap'n—low, jack, and the game!" said a one-eyed, red-haired
                  giant, whose face looked as if it had been traveled over by sharp-shod horses, it
                  was so full of cuts and slashes.</p>
               <p>The man he addressed as captain looked a trifle more decent than the rest, so far
                  as dress was concerned; but yet he was a ruffian, as well as the rest. That could
                  be plainly seen.</p>
               <p>"So you are! That puts you hout, and I'm stuck for the lush! You're in luck, Red
                  Slasher!" cried the captain.</p>
               <p>"For once in my life; and it's a'most time!" said the other, with a coarse
                  chuckle, as he tossed off a glass of raw gin.</p>
               <p>Another "hand" was being dealt out, when a noise of approaching footsteps caused
                  every one to raise their eyes in the direction of the door.</p>
               <p>Two persons entered. One of them had the rough, hang-dog look which generally
                  betokens the low villain—the face of the other was partially concealed by a
                  slouched hat, and his figure muffled in a rough overcoat. But the glitter of a
                  jeweled breastpin and gold chain, as well as a finger-ring, told that, disguised
                  though he was, it was not likely that he belonged to the gang who made that
                  "boozing ken" (or drinking-place) their headquarters.</p>
               <p>"Who've you got with you, cadger?" asked the one known as captain. Aren't you
                  breakin' the rules, my swell cove?"</p>
               <p>"Not without reason, cap'n! This 'ere cove wanted to see you, and tipped the
                  blunt, so I brought him!" said the cadger.</p>
               <p>"Who is he? A spy of the coppers? On or off the cross?"</p>
               <p>"Neither the one nor t'other. But 'taint his fault if he's honest! It's honly his
                  heducation wot's to blame. But show your figurehead head, sir, and do your own
                  pattering. I'm as dry as a suckin' hen!"</p>
               <p>The stranger took off his hat and threw open his coat, revealing the face and form
                  of Harry Corryell. He was a little pale, for fierce eyes were glaring upon him,
                  and rough men were around him, who were, as he well knew, so steeped in crime that
                  to commit one was a pleasure—to avoid one, a difficulty.</p>
               <p>"What do you want with Captain Barrington?" asked the captain, after he had
                  measured his visitor's calibre with a single, searching glance.</p>
               <p>"Your services in a matter of importance!" said Corryell, tremulously.</p>
               <p>"You know who and what I am?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, the terror of—"</p>
               <p>"Enough, sir!" said the captain, roughly. "If you know, that's enough, without
                  telling of it."</p>
               <p>"Have you got plenty of blunt to pay me for work? I don't do jobs for nothing!" he
                  continued.</p>
               <p>"Money, you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, what else?"</p>
               <p>"I have plenty of it. There's a specimen!" and Corryell tossed a purse of gold
                  down within reach of the captain, who took it up, weighed it with an air that
                  showed considerable practice in such matters, and then put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>"That's talking up to the p'int. Sit down and 'ave a glass o' lush and let's know
                  what's wanted—whose wizzen is to be cut, or what crib cracked!"</p>
               <p>"These people here?" said Corryell, looking around the room.</p>
               <p>"They all belong to me! You needn't be afeard o' them! Look out there,
                  Panel-Dick—let the gentleman's wiper alone, or I'll maul your cocoa-nut for
                  you!"</p>
               <p>This last remark was addressed to a ragged little urchin of not over five years
                  old, whose name was probably given in consequence of his use in being shoved
                  through a broken panel or window pane into a house to unlock its doors. The little
                  rascal had very dexterously removed Coryell's handkerchief from his pocket, and as
                  in obedience to the captain's repeated order, he handed it back to the owner, he
                  sniveled out:</p>
               <p>"I honly did it to keep my 'and in!"</p>
               <p>"Well, there's no 'arm done, younker, so you needn't get briny about it, but keep
                  your 'ands hout of the pockets of hour friends! And pickin' pockets is a low
                  business for a cracksman! You haught to be habove it, if you are but a kid! Your
                  dad would have wolloped you if he'd ha' caught you doin' such 'ha penny
                  business!"</p>
               <p>"Dad's lagged, and gone up, and can't wallop me no more!" said the young
                  hopeful.</p>
               <p>"But 'ere's one wot can!" said the captain. "You mus'n't forget that I'm your
                     <emph>gardeen</emph>. He's a queer 'un!" said the captain, rather
                  apologetically, to Corryell. "His father was the best cracksman in Hingland; but
                  he liked his lush too well, and the coppers cotched him napping! So they took him,
                  and he was lagged!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Lagged?</emph> What's that?" asked Harry.</p>
               <p>"Bless my heyes! 'Ow hignorant the man is!" said the captain, in surprise. "Why,
                  he was took and 'ung! 'Ung by the neck, till he was as dead as a frozen
                  cricket!"</p>
               <p>"Ah—I see—I see!" said Harry, comprehending the term, now.</p>
               <p>"If you'd rayther make your business known to me halone, there's a hinner room in
                  the 'ouse, where we can be by hourselves for a bit," continued the captain.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>had</emph> rather; and, in the meantime, let your men order a bowl of
                  punch, at my expense!" said Corryell, throwing down a piece of gold on the
                  table.</p>
               <p>"They never drinks no such weak stuff as punch," said Barrington, with unequivocal
                  disdain. "We cracksmen go in for pure lush, and never water our grog. But your
                  meanin' is all as good, and they can pitch into the blue-ruin, while you make me
                  hunderstand wot you want. Here, Pannel-Dick, here's my pipe for you to
                  finish."</p>
               <p>"I've got one o' my hown, old 'un," said the precocious youngster, showing a pipe,
                  at which he was already whiffing with all the gravity of a Camanche chief.</p>
               <p>"He's a game 'un, if he is little," said the burglar chief, as he led the way to
                  the inner-room of which he had spoken. "He'll make a tip-top cross-man, if he
                  grows up as he's begun. He can creep through a seven-by-nine pane o' glass now;
                  and there's not a handier chap at a lock in the three kingdoms. He hunderstands
                  all sorts of 'em. If he don't get too fond of lush, like his dad, he'll be an
                  inwaluable—he will."</p>
               <p>"I should think he was in a fair way for distinction, in his line," said Corryell,
                  as he followed Barrington in.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
               <p>After an absence of full an hour, Barrington returned with Corryell to the smoky
                  taproom. The company had been increased by a dashing-looking girl whom the captain
                  addressed as "Phone"—it being an abbreviation of the more classical name of
                  Sophronia.</p>
               <p>She had a bold, dashing style of beauty, quite new and very attractive to young
                  Corryell; and as she was dressed in really handsome style, he bowed very low when
                  Barrington introduced him as a "young Hamerican wot had business with him."</p>
               <p>"That's a love of a ring on your finger," said the lioness, to Harry, pointing to
                  a three or four hundred dollar cluster of brilliants on his little finger.</p>
               <p>"Do you think so? I should be glad to have you accept of it," said he.</p>
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6962-00000020"/>
               <p>"Seeing that you're an American, I will," said she, with a gracious smile.</p>
               <p>"You like Americans, then, do you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; they're so precious green," she said, as she transferred the ring to her
                  finger with the grace and air of a queen—a comedy queen, I mean.</p>
               <p>Corryell was a little abashed by the remark; but so sweet a smile accompanied it,
                  that he began to feel as if his ring was not utterly thrown away, and he asked her
                  if she had ever visited America.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes!" said she; "I was in New York a little while. I received rather too much
                  attention from a gentleman named Richard Riker, and a friend of his called Hays,
                  and had to <emph>haze</emph> myself back across the water. But I did well while I
                  was there. I boarded at the 'City' with my servant, and somehow it got out that I
                  was a countess and an heiress <abbr>incog.;</abbr> and the uptown
                     <emph>nobs</emph> made all the world of me. I was invited to soirées and balls,
                  without number; and had nearly every bachelor from Wall street at my feet."</p>
               <p>"You look very young."</p>
               <p>"To be sure I do; and <emph>handsome,</emph> why didn't you add? I know it. We
                  English women know how to take care of ourselves; but your poor, pale Yankee girls
                  don't—"</p>
               <p>"Hold on your chaffing a bit, Phone, and let me get in a word hedge-ways!" said
                  the captain. "Where's Gentleman Bill—does any of you know?"</p>
               <p>"I 'eard 'im say as 'ow he was goin' to the hopera," said Panel-Dick.</p>
               <p>"Then he has gone to the hopera? Phone, couldn't you git in there and tip him the
                  wink, and let him know he's wanted 'ere? I've some 'otel work for him to do, for
                  this gentleman, and he's just the chap to do it."</p>
               <p>"Yes—<emph>I</emph> can go there! I'd like to see the place I couldn't get into,
                  or get out of!" said the amazon. "Give us a taste of French brandy, cap, and I'm
                  off."</p>
               <p>The captain smiled grimly, and went after the particular liquor she demanded; and
                  she had time to turn her attention to Corryell again, apparently determining to
                  finish the conquest she had commenced to make.</p>
               <p>"Where d'ye put up at, young gentleman?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"At the 'St. George and Dragon' hotel. My mother and myself stop there, with our
                  servants," said Harry, laying a stress on the word servants.</p>
               <p>"Oh, your <emph>mother</emph> is along to take care of you, is she? Well, maybe
                  I'll drop in to see you. If I do, remember, I'm Miss Coutts, the daughter of the
                  rich banker. Don't forget it, or I'll forget you."</p>
               <p>Harry stammered out a hope that she would neither forget him nor fail to call.</p>
               <p>"Yes; I may 'ave to send her on business!" said the captain, as he brought a
                  pitcher of strong French brandy to the table.</p>
               <p>"Come drink to me, my love," said, or rather sung, the siren, as she poured out
                  some of the liquor for herself, and filled a glass for Harry.</p>
               <p>The latter, scarcely thinking of the strength of the liquor, drained his glass at
                  a breath, nearly strangling himself in so doing.</p>
               <p>"Now," said the girl, after a few words of private conversation with Barrington,
                  "if you're done with the captain, young man, I'll take you to your hotel. My
                  carriage is just a couple of squares off."</p>
               <p>"Don't fail to let me know the moment you've got his papers," said Corryell, in a
                  stammering tone, which showed that he felt the liquor he had swallowed.</p>
               <p>"I shan't; and mind that you 'ave the blunt ready to pay for the first job. When
                  that's done, we'll know what to hexpect from you, hafterwards!" said
                  Barrington.</p>
               <p>"The money shall be ready, sir," said Harry.</p>
               <p>"Come along—come along, stupid! Don't you know it's shockingly vulgar to keep a
                     <emph>lady</emph> waiting!" cried the girl, fairly dragging him off.</p>

               <p>"What the divil is the matter, doctor dear?" cried Tyrconnel, a couple of mornings
                  after they had located at Mynert's, as he rushed almost breathlessly into Watson's
                  room. "What's the matter? The waitin' boy says you've sent for me, and that you're
                  actin' like a crazy man, and swearin' like a tipsy praste!"</p>
               <p>"I've been robbed! My trunks were broken open last night, right here under my very
                  nose, while I slept, and every dollar I have with me, as well as my papers,
                  taken!"</p>
               <p>"And are you fretting about the money, doctor dear?"</p>
               <p>"Who would not? a stranger in a strange land!"</p>
               <p>"Not yourself, sure, when my heart jumps with gladness at the chance to have it in
                  my power to serve you!" cried the warm-hearted peer. "I'm at home in the money
                  line, and a thousand pounds or two, or more yet, lies in my banker's hands, askin'
                  in all the eloquence of silence, for a free circulation; and if you don't help me
                  to circulate it, you're not a <emph>blood</emph> doctor! Mind that, will ye?"</p>
               <p>"I thank you for your kind offer; but the loss of my papers is more than that of
                  my money."</p>
               <p>"Your papers? Was the will among 'em?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure it was."</p>
               <p>"And then, don't you see the secret of your robbery?"</p>
               <p>"No; do you?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure I do; even if I am half blind with fun and folly. That old catamaran,
                  the widow, is at the bottom of all this. She's been and hired some thafe to get
                  the will for her. That job over, she'll get us <emph>burked</emph>; and then
                  she'll be ready to go back to swate Ameriky."</p>
               <p>"Get us <emph>burked?</emph> What do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Get us properly prepared for anatomical subjects. Laid out to cool on a boord,
                  d'ye see. When the witnesses to the will are dead, and she has burned up the
                  documents, what's to hinder her from going back and being the queen o' fashion,
                  and leader of the ton?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing. But what ought I to do, Terrence?"</p>
               <p>"First, I'd advertise, with a liberal reward for my papers; sayin' the gintleman
                  that borrowed it was welcome to the money, and should have more for the papers;
                  and I'd add, that no questions would be asked. Now all the papers will come but
                  the will; and if that doesn't come, you'll know sure that the old she-dragon is at
                  the bottom of the matter. In the meantime, I'll get one of the police detectives
                  to work in concert with us, and maybe we'll hole the old fox before she's made
                  half the run she thinks to do."</p>
               <p>"Your advice is good, and I will follow it. And until I command funds of my own, I
                  shall have to ask your aid."</p>
               <p>"Take my pocket-book, doctor, I'll have another within an hour, and—"</p>
               <p>"A lady wishes to see Lord Tyrconnel in his own apartments," said a waiter,
                  entering.</p>
               <p>"A lady! Is she handsome, my lad?"</p>
               <p>"As good-lookin'—barrin' the color o' sherry wine that her face has, my lord—as
                  any girl that ever throd a minuet," said the servant—who, being from the "ould
                  sod," knew the worth of beauty.</p>
               <p>"It's my little French girl, with the nagur blood in her veins. I'll have news for
                  you, doctor, in the time that it takes an ould shape to shake his tail."</p>
               <p>And the eccentric peer followed the waiter in a moment.</p>
               <p>He was not long gone. He came back in fifteen or twenty minutes, and the doctor at
                  once saw that he had news to communicate, and gratified him by asking for it.</p>
               <p>"D'ye mind that I said the ould catamaran had a hand in the robbery?" asked
                  Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"Yes; have you proof of it?" replied the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Not exactly proof, but strong circumstantial evidence; and that's hung many an
                  innocent man."</p>
               <p>"Well, in this case, what is it?"</p>
               <p>"Why, the young fox went out early last night at the bidding of the ould one, and
                  he was brought home as drunk as a beast in the carriage of a woman, no better than
                  she should be, whoever she was; and his watch and breast-pin were on him when he
                  was lugged out of the carriage, and up to his room."</p>
               <p>"Well, what do you make out of that?"</p>
               <p>"That he'd been among thaves, and has consorted with 'em."</p>
               <p>"How so?"</p>
               <p>"Because he wasn't robbed. You know the ould adage, that 'there's honor among
                  thaves.' Well, you see, he'd been among 'em, thafe as he was, and most likely paid
                  'em beforehand for robbing you; after that they asked him to drink with 'em
                  somethin' stronger than lemonade, and it floored him. Well, one of them brought
                  him home safe; so you see that he'd linked himself with 'em in some way, or they
                  would have stripped him as close as a goose for the roast."</p>
               <p>"There seems to be reason in your idea."</p>
               <p>"To be sure there is. And moreover, Mam'selle Faralie says the ould lady is as
                  happy as a clam at high water, and received a visit from a fast young lady, who
                  hadn't a lady's ways with her, this morning; and that the carriage the lady came
                  in was the same that brought master Henry home last night; and after she had
                  stayed awhile, she took master Henry out riding with her; and he hasn't come back
                  yet. Now isn't that quite a batch of news for my little French girl with the nagur
                  blood in her veins to bring?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if your surmises are correct. But I will at once prepare the advertisement
                  for the morning paper, and get it off to the office."</p>
               <p>"And I'll order a cab and run over to Bow street to see the professional
                  thafe-catchers."</p>
               <p>"I do not know how to reward you for so much kindness, friend Terrence."</p>
               <p>"Oh, bother; don't be spakin' of the little that I'm able to do. If I'd the luck
                  to break my leg, or catch the small-pox, wouldn't you do as much or more for me?
                  Good luck to ye, till I come back."</p>

               <p>In a private, and far better furnished-room in the same building in which the
                  tap-room was situated, when we introduced Captain Barrington and his associates,
                  the last named individual sat, early on the morning following his first interview
                  with young Corryell.</p>
               <p>The room had more the appearance of a poor lawyer's study, than anything else; for
                  various law books were scattered about it; there was a desk, with writing
                  materials in abundance; and quite a variety of old clothes hung here and
                  there.</p>
               <p>Mr., or rather Captain, Barrington, sat with his feet on the fender, before a
                  cheerful fire, holding in one hand a bright tumbler of hot brandy and water, and
                  in the other the morning paper.</p>
               <p>A peculiar signal given by one heavy and three very light knocks on the door, took
                  his attention from the paper, and raising his dark eyes, he cried out:</p>
               <p>"Come in on the cross, whoever you may be!"</p>
               <p>The door was opened from without, and a young man dressed in a quiet, genteel
                  style, <unclear>such</unclear> a one as might become a student of<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC6962-00000021"/> divinity, or a young apothecary, just "set up" for
                  himself, or a professor at a modern seminary for the moral, religious and
                  intellectual instruction of young ladies, entered; and, with the most unobtrusive
                  air, took a chair, and cast a longing eye toward the table near the captain's
                  elbow, where a black bottle, a pitcher of smoking water and a sugar-bowl,
                  suggested the contents of the glass which the captain was sipping so
                  pleasantly.</p>
               <p>"'Elp yourself, Gentleman Bill, 'elp yourself, and then report progress!" said the
                  captain, as he laid the paper on his knee, and took a cigar from a bunch on the
                  mantle before him, and lighted it.</p>
               <p>The young man promptly complied with the proffered invitation, and then said:</p>
               <p>"I've got 'em cap'n—had tough work, but I've got 'em!"</p>
               <p>"Hof course—I knew you'd '<emph>ave</emph> 'em, but let's see what they are!" said
                  Barrington to his subordinate.</p>
               <p>The quiet-looking young gentleman drew from various pockets of his black
                  frock-coat, first, a large bundle of letters and papers; next, a purse of gold and
                  silver coin; after that, a pocket-book; after that, a pocket-case of surgical
                  instruments, a lancet-case, a pair of tooth-pullers, and a box of pills!"</p>
               <p>"You've been in the right room, Bill!" said Barrington, as he opened the case of
                  surgical instruments. "They've been to sea—they're rusty as a pair of old
                  bracelets!" (handcuffs.)</p>
               <p>"Did you hever know me to make a mistake, cap'n, when you'd put me on the lay?"
                  asked Gentleman Bill, as he about half-emptied his glass.</p>
               <p>"I don't think I hever did!" said the captain. "But we'll take a look into the
                  papers, to see if that's hamong 'em what we're paid for to get!"</p>
               <p>So saying, with a hand and eye that betokened education enough to overhaul a
                  ledger or docket, the captain opened the papers, commenting on each as he did
                  so.</p>
               <p>"Certificate that Doctor Watson belongs to the Medical Hacademy of New York;
                  letter of credit on Baring Brothers—that'll be stopped afore we can use it; check
                  on the Bank of Hingland—that can be tried on, second'anded at a hearly hour;
                  letters from Susan—who in 'evens is Susan? The will of Richard Milldollar, Esq.,
                  merchant, of New York! That's the dockyment, Bill, that ere is worth a thousand
                  pound to us now—the Lord only knows what we can make hout of it 'erehafter! I want
                  you to copy it so nicely that we can keep the horiginal, while we 'and hover the
                  copy and get the blunt for it!"</p>
               <p>"Ay, sir. I can do that, heasy!"</p>
               <p>And Gentleman Bill finished his glass of liquor, and then took the will to the
                  desk. Here it took him some time to find paper which looked like that used in the
                  will; but when he had done it, he speedily set to work to transcribe the article,
                  having to alter the shade of his ink a trifle to do it. While he was thus engaged,
                  the captain counted the money in the doctor's purse, examined the rest of his
                  papers, and then filled another glass of hot toddy for himself, and one for his
                  quondam secretary.</p>
               <p>"Thank'ee, Cap'n—thank'ee kindly. See 'ow the one will compare with the hother!"
                  said Gentleman Bill, as he laid the two papers before the captain.</p>
               <p>"For the life hof me, I can't tell which is the horiginal!" said the captain.
                  "Bill, you're a hinwaluable hacquisition to our gang! Which <emph>is</emph> the
                  horiginal?"</p>
               <p>"That one with a blot in the corner. I must make a blot in this one like it, and
                  add a private mark, for I can 'ardly tell 'em apart myself!"</p>
               <p>"The job is done hup nice, Bill!" said the captain, admiringly. "And as this is a
                  work known honly to Phone and you and me, we'll go thirds in it—that is the will
                  part, and honly put the money you got into the reg'lar treasury!"</p>
               <p>"That's a good hidea, cap'n, and one hexcessively hagreeable to me! Is this all
                  you want me to do in the matter?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Bill! There's work for rougher 'ands than yours, by-and-by; work I'd like to
                  be rid of. But if they pays—why, we can't refuse their work no more than we can
                  their money!"</p>
               <p>"That's so cap'n—'eres your 'ealth!" and the quiet young gentleman tipped his
                  glass bottom up, while its contents went down a well-traveled path.</p>
               <p>A similar signal to that which Bill had given was now heard at the door; and in
                  answer to the captain's bidding, the door opened, and the same female entered whom
                  we described in a former chapter, under the familiar name of "Phone."</p>
               <p>"Well, larks, you're stirring early," said she, as she stepped into the room.</p>
               <p>"Himportant business, Phone—himportant business, my dear. 'Ow did you get on with
                  the green 'un?" said the captain.</p>
               <p>"First chop, captain," replied the girl. "He's a regular green 'un; and I mean to
                  skin him and his old woman alive! I'm going to visit her to-day—what shall I say
                  to the hopeful for you?"</p>
               <p>"Tell him to come 'ere and bring the blunt, for I've got the dockyment he wanted!
                  That's hall, old gal!"</p>
               <p>"How soon can I begin to draw on him, cap'n—you know he'll ripen fast in London,
                  and I must pick him while he's green!"</p>
               <p>"I'll let you know when we're done with him, Phone! Meantime, the deeper he gets
                  in love the better!"</p>
               <p>"He's in up to his ears now!" said the girl, laughing. "But I must be off, now.
                  I've got something to say to you, Bill. Let's travel el." And the young man and
                  woman left the captain to enjoy his paper and cigar by himself.</p>

               <p>Watson had but just returned from his visit to the <title>Times</title> office,
                  where he had paid for the insertion of his advertisement, when Tyrconnel entered
                  with two individuals, whom he introduced as Messrs. Grab and Holdem, of the Bew
                  street Police office.</p>
               <p>The first-named individual one would judge, from his looks, to be a retired
                  merchant, he looked so portly, red-faced, easy and contented. There was nothing of
                  that harsh, repulsive, bull-doggish expression, which one would expect to find in
                  a regular thief-catcher. His expression was so bland and charitable, that even a
                  professional beggar might have been deceived in his looks, and asked him to help a
                  large family of seven children and the mother, all down with the measles. His
                  dress was genteel—voluminous of cloth, and indicative of substantial comfort. No
                  one would think that such large coat-pockets would be adapted to carrying
                  hand-cuffs and pistols, instead of bandannas and sweet-cakes. But they certainly
                  did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Holdem, the partner of Mr. Grab, <emph>had</emph> the morose, bull-doggish
                  expression which should be natural to a constable or policeman; for I hold that—as
                  their business is a harsh one, they ought to look harsh. There's my old friend
                  Leonard, the smoothest, best-dressed man in Gotham, a favorite with the ladies,
                  and a Chesterfield in his manners—what business has he to be a policeman?—none at
                  all, so far as looks are concerned—yet the best man that New York has had since
                  Hays, "old Hays," departed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Holdem was Bowyer-built—that is short, thick-necked, broad-shouldered,
                  red-faced, strong-limbed. He looked as if he would hold anything which Mr. Grab,
                  having secured, had placed in his care.</p>
               <p>"Well, doctor, these gentlemen are from Bow street—the first, Mr. Grab—"</p>
               <p>"Jonas Grab, if you please, my Lord!" said the individual alluded to.</p>
               <p>"The first, doctor, Mr. Jonas Grab, is the manager of the firm—the second, is the
                  worker, Mr. Holdem!" said Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"Both workers—both workers, my lord, though I have management by consent!" said
                  Mr. Grab. "And, my lord, if your friend, the doctor, will inform us of the full
                  particulars of the robbery, so far as he knows—also what inducements anybody had
                  to rob him beyond the money he has lost, and every other particular bearing on the
                  case, we'll take the matter in hand, and do our best for him!"</p>
               <p>The doctor, after inviting the officers to be seated, detailed the specialties
                  which Mr. Grab had asked for. The latter listened to them all, from time to time,
                  noting down such as required attention in a small book.</p>
               <p>"Now, if you please, doctor, let me see the trunks that were opened!" said he,
                  after the doctor had said all that he had to say.</p>
               <p>"Done neat, by a professional hand. He may have had keys, but your American locks
                  troubled him, and he used a picker!" said the officer, as he looked at the trunk
                  locks.</p>
               <p>"Was your door locked?" he continued.</p>
               <p>"Yes, when I went to sleep, and also when I rose and examined it in the morning!"
                  said Watson.</p>
               <p>The officer went to the door and took out the key. Pointing to some marks on it,
                  he said:</p>
               <p>"Nippers unlocked your door and locked it again! A professional has been at work.
                  It's a pity he hadn't carried off your watch or clothing or something he could
                  pawn. That might help us on his track, but we've enough now to open work with.
                  This lady whom you suspect, and her son, stop at the Saint George and Dragon. Our
                  first work will be to see who visits them and whom they visit. Take my advice,
                  sir, and don't go abroad much until I look into the matter. Send for me the moment
                  you get an answer to your advertisement! No matter what it is, send for me. Here
                  is our card—Grab and Holdem. But send to me—Jonas Grab, Bow street!"</p>
               <p>"I will!' said the doctor.</p>
               <p>And the officers hurried away to prosecute the business in hand.</p>

               <p>It was about the hour of noon, not much if any later, when Harry Corryell again
                  entered the private room of Captain Barrington.</p>
               <p>"Well sir, 'ow do you feel to-day?" asked the chief of the professionals.</p>
               <p>"Prime, sir—prime! The young lady who took me away last night and brought me back
                  just now, tells me that you've succeeded!"</p>
               <p>"Ay—we've got the dockyment! But 'ave you brought the blunt?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure, sir! we mean to deal fair with you, as we expect to be dealt with!"
                  said Harry, as he drew forth a well-lined pocket-book.</p>
               <p>"Hall's right sir, hall's right, we know; but business is business, you see!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and should be attended to. Here are the notes for a thousand pounds on the
                  bank of England!" said Corryell.</p>
               <p>"And there's the will!" said Barrington, tossing over the well-executed duplicate,
                  while he drew the bank-notes toward himself.</p>
               <p>"Yes—it is the paper, written and signed, as my mother said it was!" said the
                  young man, as he pocketed the other papers.</p>
               <p>"And when that's put hout o' the way, it leaves you and your mother rich, don't
                  it?" asked Barrington.</p>
               <p>"Not until the witnesses are gone—when<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6962-00000022"/>
                  they're out of our way, we're well off; a couple of million will be nothing to
                  us!"</p>
               <p>"And you'll come down andsomely to see them out of the way, won't you?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure we will. Name your price and do the job. That is all we ask!"</p>
               <p>"And what'll you do for me, dear?" asked Phone, with a most killing smile, as she
                  looked the young villain in the eye.</p>
               <p>"Make you my wife!" said Harry, as he pressed her small, white hand.</p>
               <p>"Ah, but you're joking! You wouldn't take a poor girl like me for your wife, when
                  you might do better with a fortune in your hands!'</p>
               <p>"I couldn't do better; you're an angel!" said the infatuated youth.</p>
               <p>"All but the wings!" said the girl, with a laugh. "Can't you find some champagne
                  in honor of that compliment, cap'n?"</p>
               <p>"I'll try!" said Barrington, and he went out of the room.</p>
               <p>"Do you—may I hope, that you love me, Miss Sophronia?" asked Harry, the moment
                  they were alone.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, you may hope, but before I swear that I love you, you've got to prove
                  that you love me!"</p>
               <p>And the wicked beauty smiled so kindly on him, that his hopes rose above
                  high-water-mark in less than no time.</p>
               <p>The entrance of the captain with a bottle of champagne prevented the young man
                  from giving any very open signs of his joy, but when called upon to fill a bumper
                  to the "good times" coming, he did it without any hesitation.</p>
               <p>"You must keep a good look-out, and see that none o' the Bow-street sharks get on
                  our track through you!" said Barrington, as he put down his empty glass.</p>
               <p>"Bow-street sharks? what are they?" asked Harry.</p>
               <p>"The London police, dear!" said Phone. "By the way, did you give the cap'n all the
                  brads you had with you?"</p>
               <p>"The brads!" asked Harry, in his ignorance.</p>
               <p>"Yes, the brads, my dear. Did you give him all the money you had along?"</p>
               <p>"Oh no—do you want some?"</p>
               <p>"No, I don't want any money; but in a jeweler's store near Charing Cross there is
                  the prettiest little watch that ever—ever you did see!"</p>
               <p>"Or even a pretty girl wore! You shall have it my love. Is your carriage waiting?"
                  said Harry.</p>
               <p>"Yes for us, love—always for us," and the siren drew young Corryell's arm within
                  her own.</p>
               <p>"Wait a bit, Phone?" said the captain. "The gentleman and I must come to a
                  hunderstanding about the witnesses he wants put hout of the way. What's the terms,
                  Mister Corryell?"</p>
               <p>"A thousand pounds each, paid the moment we know they're out of the way!" said
                  Corryell.</p>
               <p>"Well, you can count on the job as good as done. Take good care of the gentleman,
                  Phone!"</p>
               <p>"To be sure I will! Don't I love him better than life?" said the siren, as she led
                  the half-bewildered New Yorker away.</p>
               <p>"That girl is a trump, a face trump in the last of a hard hand!" said Barrington,
                  admiringly, as she led her dupe away! "She is as heartless as a rock, as sharp as
                  steel, and as cool as a lump of hice. She doesn't seem to care for money hafter
                  she gets it, but goes into rascality just for the love of the thing!"</p>
               <p>And he renewed his toddy and relighted his cigar.</p>

               <p>In answer to his advertisement, Dr. Watson received every paper that he had lost
                     <emph>but</emph> the will, in a package, accompanied with a note, thanking him
                  for the loan of his purse, and politely refusing the reward he had offered for the
                  papers.</p>
               <p>"I only wanted money," said the writer; "and your purse having supplied my wants,
                  I cheerfully send back the papers."</p>
               <p>Tyrconnel and the officer, Grab, were at once sent for by the doctor, after he had
                  received the package.</p>
               <p>"By the powers! but the thafe has a gentility in his impudence that's amusing!
                  Thanks you for the loan of your purse!" said the peer, when he read the note.</p>
               <p>"Have you ever seen any handwriting like it before?" asked the officer.</p>
               <p>"No—not that I know of; but, on a second look, it is very much like my own—a
                  little more clerkly; but, for all that, very like my own," said the doctor.</p>
               <p>"So I thought," said the officer, dryly, as he produced the note the doctor had
                  sent to him.</p>
               <p>The doctor looked at the note, and then at the officer; and in a tone half of
                  anger, half of doubt, said:</p>
               <p>"You do not mean to insinuate that I wrote the answer to my own
                  advertisement?"</p>
               <p>"By no means, sir," said Mr. Grab. "Yet you must acknowledge that the two
                  handwritings are very much alike?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure they are. But why, I cannot see."</p>
               <p>"Yet I can. The writer of the note replying to your advertisement is, or has been,
                  copying some of the papers in your writing which he has got hold of."</p>
               <p>"The will was in my handwriting," said Watson.</p>
               <p>"It may be that they have copied that: London thieves are deep, and look beyond
                  momentary advantages. But this note is of no advantage to us now. We have already
                  tracked out an intimacy between the son of Mrs. Mildollar and the head of a
                  notorious gang of thieves. He has visited him twice, and been taken home both
                  times by a woman belonging to the gang."</p>
               <p>"Well, what would you advise in the case, Mr. Grab?"</p>
               <p>"There's two ways of going to work, sir," said the officer. "One would detect them
                  in the start, provided they hadn't destroyed the papers—which, if they're keen,
                  they'd do at the outset. The other will give 'em a chance to work, but put 'em off
                  their guard. The first way would be, to get out a search-warrant, and overhaul
                  their traps, and let 'em know we suspected 'em. If we found the papers they'd be
                  in a tight place. If we didn't, they'd be ahead of us, and maybe distance us, in
                  the end. But if we keep quiet, and lay a watch for 'em, we may find out more, in a
                  little while, than they'd think for in a year."</p>
               <p>"That is so, Mr. Grab," said the doctor. "And as you are used to managing hard
                  cases, we will leave this matter entirely to you, and be guided by your
                  instructions."</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir. You shall not be disappointed in your trust. All that I ask is,
                  that you only do as I direct you to; and I think we'll be even with the tribe yet.
                  But we've a hard set to deal with. Clint Barrington, the head of the gang, is as
                  keen a rascal as ever worked on the cross. In the first place, do not go abroad
                  without sending word to me where and when you are going, and giving me a chance to
                  foil them, if they try to put you out of the way. I expect that will be their next
                  game; for they'll be desperate, if they're paid for it."</p>
               <p>And with these words, Mr. Grab excused himself, and went away.</p>
               <p>"Well, what do you think of matters, Tyrconnel, my friend?" asked the doctor, when
                  the two friends were alone.</p>
               <p>"I think I'd like to wring the necks of the old catamaran and that son of hers!
                  He's a big lubber, any way. If it wouldn't be a disgrace to me, I'd provoke him
                  into calling me out, and bore a hole in his carcass with an ounce of lead. But
                  he's a blackguard, at best; and not fit to die, like a gentleman, on the field of
                  honor."</p>

               <p>Mrs. Mildollar and her son sat alone in their private parlor at the "St. George
                  and the Dragon;" and spread out on the table before them was the package of papers
                  which had been taken from Dr. Watson's trunk. Among them all, there was but one of
                  interest to that wicked woman. It was the will—which, if executed, would leave her
                  poor, and which she hoped, when destroyed, would leave her wealthy—if she
                  succeeded as well in having the witnesses put out of the way.</p>
               <p>"A pretty document for a dying man to sign!" she said, scornfully, as she read it
                  over—"a pretty document!"</p>
               <p>And she smiled yet more bitterly, as she cast it into the blazing coal-grate, and
                  saw it consumed.</p>
               <p>"There's an end of that!" she said, as she saw the last remnants fly in reddened
                  ashes up the strong-draughted chimney.</p>
               <p>"What are the other papers, mother?" asked the son.</p>
               <p>"Nothing to us, and may as well go into the fire," said Mrs. Mildollar, taking
                  them in her hands.</p>
               <p>"Not just now, if you please, madam. The cap'n has sent for them," said a quiet
                  and rather gentlemanly-looking young man, who had entered the room so silently
                  that neither mother nor son had heard his footsteps.</p>
               <p>"Who are you, sir, and what do you want here?" asked Mrs. Mildollar, drawing up in
                  a dignified manner.</p>
               <p>"I am an attaché of the court of Captain Barrington; my name is Gentleman Bill;
                  and I want all of the papers there that are of no use to you," said the
                  intruder—"or, at least, the captain does."</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"Because they are advertised for—and if they're sent back, may do us some good
                  'ere-after, and no ways can't do us any 'arm—so the cap'n thinks!"</p>
               <p>"He wants to send them back, eh? I'll look them over, and see what they are," said
                  Mrs. Mildollar.</p>
               <p>"You're in luck, young gentleman—you are!" said Bill, in a low tone, to Harry,
                  while Mrs. Mildollar's attention was riveted on the papers.</p>
               <p>"How so?" asked Corryell.</p>
               <p>"You've got the love of the finest girl in existence," said Bill, with a sigh. "I
                  'ad 'oped in that direction myself, before you come hafoul of her; but my chances
                  are hover now."</p>
               <p>Harry smiled, and asked Gentleman Bill to go to the side-board and take
                  something.</p>
               <p>The latter said he was not a drinking man—seldom took anything strong, but on this
                  occasion, thought he might. His spirits had been uncommonly low ever since Phone
                  had transferred her affections to Mr. Corryell, he added. And then, while a deep
                  sigh attested the truth of his remarks, he filled a tumbler with strong brandy,
                  and emptied it at a single swallow, without having added the qualifications of
                  either sugar or water.</p>
               <p>"There are none of these papers that will be of any use to <emph>us,</emph>" said
                  Mrs. Mildollar, as she laid down the package. "You can take them, young man."</p>
               <p>"Thank'ee, ma'am—thankee!" said Bill.</p>
               <p>And bowing politely, he took the papers, and made his exit.</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to say, Harry, that that pious-looking, steady, gentlemanly young
                     man<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6962-00000023"/> belongs to the gang of thieves?"
                  asked Mrs. Mildollar.</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother. Why, the captain of the gang is a real gentleman, by the way. He
                  dresses like one—looks like one—acts like one."</p>
               <p>"Well, I wish their work was done, and we were on our way back. I don't feel easy
                  in our connection with such people."</p>
               <p>"It don't matter, so long as it isn't known," said the son, lighting a cigar, and
                  seating himself by the window to smoke. "We can't do better than we are doing.
                  We've got the will safe!"</p>
               <p>"Yes—<emph>it</emph> is safe enough," said the widow, looking at the fire which
                  had destroyed it. "I only wish that the witnesses were as well out of the way.
                  Have you heard of the condition of Captain Jones since he landed?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—once. I sent my man to Mynert's to find out, and he heard that he was very
                  low, and not expected to live."</p>
               <p>"I hope the news is true. The captain would be a bad witness against us. Neither
                  he nor the doctor could be bought over, while the steward might! When will the
                  captain take steps to put the doctor and his officious Irish friend out of the
                  way?"</p>
               <p>"Immediately—the first chance that offers. I'd not like to insure their lives for
                  four-and-twenty hours. I'd give a cool thousand to fix the Irishman off myself,
                  for I owe him a grudge which his blood only can wipe out!"</p>
               <p>"Don't speak so loud, my son. The maid is in the next room."</p>
               <p>"Oh, she don't know what we're talking about, and at the best, don't understand
                  English well. As long as she gets her pay, and can dress well, and gets liberty to
                  promenade, I reckon she'll not mind any of our business."</p>
               <p>"Yet we cannot be too careful while we are walking on dangerous ground!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
               <p>For a week or more, nothing occurred to alarm or trouble the doctor or his friend
                  Tyrconnel; though, from information received through Faralie, they knew that harm
                  was intended them, and remained constantly on their guard. The doctor was obliged
                  to be abroad considerably, in visiting the hospitals, and attending to the
                  business for which he came over; but both he and his friend took care to move out
                  only in the day-time—for they could not believe that harm could reach two
                  well-armed and careful men in so great a city in broad daylight: the more
                  especially that Messrs. Grab and Holdem had been especially paid and retained as a
                  guard, as well as to endeavor to discover the whereabouts of the important
                  document which the doctor had lost.</p>
               <p>But in the afternoon of a cold, foggy, disagreeable day, an hour or two before
                  night, yet almost as dark as it is usually at twilight, they met with a most
                  serious adventure They had been on a visit to a private hospital of which the
                  doctor wished some knowledge, and were taking a near out to return to their hotel,
                  going on foot—preferring the exercise of walking to jolting along in a cab.
                  Suddenly, at the corner of a street, they came plump against a small boy who was
                  running toward them, crying bitterly—so plump, that the doctor unintentionally
                  knocked the child down.</p>
               <p>The urchin, at this, redoubled his cries; and the doctor, as he kind-heartedly
                  picked him up, put a shilling in his hand, and tried to still his cries.</p>
               <p>"I don't want no money! Money won't save my poor mother!" cried the boy,
                  piteously.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter with your mother, poor child?" asked the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir! she's <emph>so</emph> sick, hand we're too poor to 'ave a doctor."</p>
               <p>"Why, I'm a doctor, my little fellow; and if she lives near by, I'll see if I can
                  do her any good."</p>
               <p>"Oh, be you a doctor, sir? I don't mind your running hover me a bit, hif you'll
                  honly go and see my mother! She lives just haround the corner—honly a little ways
                  down the next street, sir," said the youngster, wiping his eyes with the ragged
                  cuff of his jacket.</p>
               <p>"A poor woman sick and destitute is a good excuse for a moment's delay," said the
                  doctor to Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"To be sure, doctor. 'Twas the good heart in ye that spoke then; and I'll go with
                  ye, and maybe I've a trifle that'll help the poor sowl in her affliction."</p>
               <p>"What is your name, my little lad?" asked the doctor, looking kindly on the boy,
                  who clung to his hand, as if he feared that the doctor would not go with him.</p>
               <p>"Mother calls me Richard, sir; but the boys call me Dick, for short."</p>
               <p>"How much further is it, my little chicken?" asked Tyrconnel. "You said 'twas just
                  around the corner—and we've turned two of 'em, I'll swear!"</p>
               <p>"It's honly a little bit further, sir—just down this street," said the boy,
                  pointing to a dark and narrow lane before them. "There's the 'ouse, sir—that
                  dark-lookin' one. We has but one room, and 'ave to go hin at the back-door, d'ye
                  see."</p>
               <p>"By the howly Saint Pathrick! by the dirt and smell of it in this neighborhood, I
                  shouldn't wonder if there was sickness around here," said Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"Is this the house, my boy?" asked the doctor, as they reached a dark,
                  rough-looking old tenement.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. Come in. It's dark in the passage, but lighter in mother's room. Come
                  in, sir."</p>
               <p>And the boy led the way into the dark entry.</p>
               <p>The doctor hurried on, thinking not of danger, but of the kind act he was
                  performing, while his friend followed close after. Suddenly, the doctor stumbled
                  over some impediment, and fell, not upon the floor, but down apparently into a
                  cellar, for he felt damp ground beneath him, and knew by the shock that he had
                  fallen some distance. Scarce a second later, he was followed by Tyrconnel, and at
                  the same instant, they heard the crash of something like the closing of a
                  trap-door over them.</p>
               <p>"What the divil is to pay now, doctor?" said Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"Heaven only knows!" said Watson. "Boy—boy, where are you? You,
                     <emph>Richard</emph>—DICK?"</p>
               <p>"Call me PANEL-DICK, master; I likes to hear my whole name," cried the little
                  rascal, with a shrill laugh from above.</p>
               <p>"Get a light, and show us the way out of here," cried the doctor.</p>
               <p>"I'm not so jolly green as all that, Mr. Sawbones. When my mother gets worse, I'll
                  come and call you."</p>
               <p>"By the powers! we're in a trap now, doctor," said Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>see</emph> we are," said the doctor, moodily.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>feel</emph> we are; but as to <emph>seeing</emph> in this dark hole,
                  that's another thing! If we had a bit of a light, to know what kind of a hole
                  we're in, I'd like it!"</p>
               <p>"We must tell by feeling. That young wretch has gone."</p>
               <p>"No he 'asnt, old <emph>julep!</emph> Can't you swear a bit? I likes to hear
                  fellers swear when they're mad!" yelled the little fiend.</p>
               <p>"By me sowl, I'll make you swear if I can get my ten fingers on you!" said the
                  angry peer; and he tried to feel for a staircase, or some method of getting to the
                  floor above.</p>
               <p>"You'll feel a bit 'ungry before that time comes, Mister Irishman. Wouldn't you
                  like something now? Speak kind, and tip me a guinea, and maybe I won't git it for
                  you."</p>
               <p>"I'll give you five guineas if you let us out of here," said the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Will you, now? Well, the hoffer is liberal, but I reckon the cap'n 'll get more
                  for keepin' you there! So good-bye till you see better company. I'm going to see
                  my poor mother!"</p>
               <p>They could plainly hear his footsteps, as he went away, and also heard him close a
                  door behind him. After that, all was still. They could not even hear the rattling
                  of vehicles, which almost deafened them when in the more frequented quarters.</p>
               <p>By examining with their feet and hands, they found that they were in a damp
                  cellar, not more than eighteen feet square, and not more than seven or eight deep.
                  But a thick and heavy floor was above them, and they could get nothing to stand on
                  to try and force it. Nor had they any tools, except their small pocket-knives, and
                  a brace, each, of small, single-barreled pistols.</p>
               <p>Tyrconnel, who was too full of expedients to be yet thoroughly disheartened, now
                  bethought him of another plan to elevate the doctor, so that he could work at the
                  floor overhead. Getting down on his hands and knees, he bade the doctor to mount
                  upon his back, and to try the floor above. This Watson did, but uselessly. There
                  seemed to be no means of egress which they could reach or force; and they at last
                  sat down, completely disheartened.</p>
               <p>"That bloody ould catamaran is at the bottom of this business," said Tyrconnel,
                  bitterly.</p>
               <p>"To be sure! She has got the will, most likely, and now wants to destroy the
                  witnesses," said Watson.</p>
               <p>"The ould divil! I'd like to have her at the bottom of this cellar, just now. I
                  think I should be after forgettin' that she was a woman! Ah, doctor, doctor! it's
                  bad luck we're in! They say that it's always the darkest jest before daylight,
                  though; and it's dark enough here for one to cut it with a knife."</p>
               <p>The doctor made no reply, but sunk down, moodily, to await what might yet
                  come.</p>
               <p>"I hope, if it's death they mane, they'll not starve us to death!" said Tyrconnel,
                  after a while. "If I'm of the right way of thinkin', it is a divilish
                  uncomfortable way of lavin' the world! It makes a man cannibalish and
                  inhuman."</p>
               <p>"Hark—I hear footsteps!" said the doctor.</p>
               <p>They both paused and listened for some time, but heard nothing more.</p>
               <p>"They must have been the footsteps that are used to threading the path of
                  imagination, doctor dear," whose native humor had not, even yet, deserted him. "If
                  you wasn't here, do you know what I'd do, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"No; what would it be?"</p>
               <p>"Why, if I thought the bloody thaves o' the wurruld meant to kill me, I'd chate
                  'em out o' the job."</p>
               <p>"How?"</p>
               <p>"Why, I'd put one of these pistols to my ear, and do it myself. Then, at laste, my
                  father's son could say, in the next world, that he died by the hands of a
                  gintleman, instead of a blackguard!"</p>
               <p>"The idea is like yourself, my dear Terrence; but, as it is, let me beg you to
                  hold on to the loads in your pistols, for we may have use for them yet. Do not
                  think, because I am so still, that hope has deserted me yet. When we are missed,
                  the officers will be sure to make a search for us, and the chances are even that
                  they get on our track."</p>
               <p>"Hif you'll bet hodds, I'll wager they don't!" said a gruff voice, appearing to be
                  above them.</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6962-00000024"/>
               <p>"And who the devil are you, and why don't you let a chap see your face, now?"
                  cried Tyrconnel</p>
               <p>"I'm uncommon hugly, and it might make you sick," said the voice.</p>
               <p>"A breath o' fresh air might make us well again, my friend. Do you know that the
                  atmosphere around here is damp?"</p>
               <p>"That's a lucky go for you. It'll keep you from gettin' <emph>dry!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Faith! you're a thoughtful chap. Do you know what we're down here for?"</p>
               <p>"To <emph>keep</emph>—like pickled herrings."</p>
               <p>"That's comfortable. I say, mister, what's your name?"</p>
               <p>"Call me 'Red Slasher,' or the 'One-Eyed Stag,' if you like."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Slasher or Stag with one peeper, can't you let us have a little more
                  comfort down here?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. if you <emph>pays</emph> for it! D'ye want straw?"</p>
               <p>"Well, straw would be better than the damp ground, if we're to lodge here! And a
                  bit of a candle that we may see what we look like, and a drop of something strong
                  to keep the chill off. Do as much for us as that, Mr. Stag, or Slasher, and I'll
                  spake a good word for you to Saint Peter, when I get up above!"</p>
               <p>"I 'aven't nothin' to do with no saints—I belongs to the sinner-side: but if
                  you'll fork hover the brads, I don't mind getting you some straw and a drop o'
                  summat strong, and a bite to heat."</p>
               <p>"You mean, if we'll pay you!"</p>
               <p>"Yes—what helse? Folks as is in a quandary like you be, generally are glad to 'ave
                  a chance to spend some of their loose change like gentlemen, before it's taken
                  from 'em."</p>
               <p>"How are we to hand you the money?"</p>
               <p>"I will lower down my' and kerchief through this knot 'ole 'ere—you tie the money
                  in a corner hof it; and then I'll get you what I can, but it's against
                  horders!"</p>
               <p>The doctor produced a guinea, while Tyrconnel felt for the handkerchief; and when
                  it was found, the money was passed up.</p>
               <p>The "Slasher" seemed to be very careful, for he went away, to examine the
                  money.</p>
               <p>"Hit's hall right," said he, as he came back a few moments after. "I'll go hand
                  see what I can do for you. But mind you keep still, now; hif you go to makin' hany
                  noise, the cap'n 'll do his job clean hup at once, and you'll 'ardly 'ave a chance
                  to kick!"</p>
               <p>"By me sowl, it's a chance to <emph>kick</emph> I'd like to have, for a little
                  while," said Tyrconnell. "I wouldn't be particular about the weight of my boots,
                  if I had those before me that I'd like to kick! I've heard it said, that 'liberty
                  is sweet,' and by me sowl I believe it. I'd like to try it a little while. Byron
                  was a bloody goose, when he said: <q>

                     </lg>
                  </q> Divil the pit o' brightness is there here."</p>
               <p>"Excepting that undying wit of yours, Tyrconnel."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Wit</emph>, dy'e call it! I 'am as dull as an ould hoe! And I'll be as
                  rusty, as if I have to stay here long. Och hone! to think that Terrence Tyrconnel
                  should ever get into such a hullabaloo of a scrape as this."</p>
               <p>"And all through his generous friendship for me," said the doctor, with a
                  sigh.</p>
               <p>"Now be after hushing up, doctor dear; sure it's a pleasure I feel in seeing you
                  through your throubles—for through 'em we'll get, as sure as there's a famine o'
                  snakes in Ireland. It is not the likes of us, an American sovereign and an Irish
                  peer, that'll succumb to the whimsies of fortune; divil the bit. <foreign
                     xml:lang="GAI">Erin-go-bragh!</foreign> and Hail Columby!"</p>
               <p>"Why don't you hadd God save the King?" asked their friend, Slasher, who had just
                  returned to his station above.</p>
               <p>"To the divil with the king! One of us is a republican and the other an Irishman,
                  and he's the next thing to a rebel. But where's our food?"</p>
               <p>"Make less noise, hand you'll get it," said their gruff-toned jailer. And he
                  opened what appeared to be a small wicket, or trap-door, by the little greyish
                  light they got a glimpse of, and lowered down a small basket with a light on top
                  of it.</p>
               <p>Tyrconnel took off the light, a tallow candle not more than a couple of inches
                  long, and then investigated the contents of the basket. There was a bottle of
                  brandy, another of water, and some bread and Bologna Sausage. Also some
                  cheese.</p>
               <p>"How do you like that? Dy'e think you've got your money's worth?" asked
                  Slasher.</p>
               <p>"Yes—by me sowl this brandy is as strong as an ould cat's temper! And the bread
                  and cheese look well, and so does the sausage. But they say that cats and dogs
                  breed nicely in that same Bologna, and that never an <emph>ould</emph> horse was
                  seen there."</p>
               <p>"Anything more wanted beside the straw?" asked the Slasher.</p>
               <p>"Yes; will ye do me a favor, Mr. Stag with one peeper?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure, if it hisn't hagainst the captain's rules."</p>
               <p>"Then just let me look at the purty face of you."</p>
               <p>"Then look!" said Slasher, as he stuck his head down through the hole; while
                  Tyrconnel was taking a draught from the bottle.</p>
               <p>"By the hoofs of Ould Satan, but you <emph>are</emph> a beauty!" said Tyrconnel,
                  as he looked up at the one-eyed, red-headed, scarred face, of the fellow. "But
                  your ears are a trifle too short! he added, and before the Slasher could withdraw
                  his ill-favored head, Tyrconnel had fast hold of his ears.</p>
               <p>"Let go! let go! You 'urt!" yelled the Slasher.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you come down here and kape us company, then, my beauty!" said
                  Tyrconnel, holding on to all he had got.</p>
               <p>"I can't—my shoulders can't follow my head! The 'ole is too small!" said the
                  Slasher, struggling in vain to free himself.</p>
               <p>"Then tell us how to get out of here, you one-eyed thafe, or we'll cut your throat
                  before you're a minute older!"</p>
               <p>"Let me go and I will," groaned the Slasher.</p>
               <p>"Yes; but let you go and you won't," cried Tyrconnell. "Doctor, dear, just take
                  your knife and draw it across the rascal's throat. Cut deep, so that he'll blade
                  to death aisy!"</p>
               <p>"Don't—don't!" groaned the fellow, as he saw the doctor take a knife from his
                  pocket.</p>
               <p>"I'm sorry to say it must be done, my dear fellow, without you show us how to get
                  out of this infernal hole!" said the doctor, blandly.</p>
               <p>"And take comfort, Mr. Stag with one peeper. It will be done on scientific
                  principles—the doctor understands his trade!"</p>
               <p>"'Ave pity hon me, gentlemen," said the Slasher, whose face was growing black in
                  his uncomfortable position. "I doesn't work on my hown haccount. It's not me that
                  put you down there. Let me go, and I'll go right hoff to the cap'n, and beg 'im to
                  let you hout!"</p>
               <p>"There is no use in your <emph>promising</emph>—we have offered you your life on
                  one condition: Open the door or trap, so that we can get out."</p>
               <p>"I can't—you're 'olding me down hover it!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, bother! cut his throat at once, doctor; there's no use in troubling with the
                  rascal any longer!"</p>
               <p>"I will, just as soon as I take a nip of brandy, to strengthen my arm!" said
                  Watson.</p>
               <p>"Can you 'ave the 'eart to kill the man what brought it to you?" groaned the
                  Slasher.</p>
               <p>"Yes; if you'll not let us out of here!" said the doctor, ferociously brandishing
                  his knife.</p>
               <p>"Then Heaven 'ave mercy on me; there's no 'elp for me!" groaned the Slasher.</p>
               <p>But at that instant the sound of hurried footsteps were heard coming.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
               <p>It was night, and poor Faralie sat in Tyrconnel's room, where she had been for
                  hours, awaiting his return. She was pale, and her eyes were red with weeping; for
                  she had heard that from the arch-conspirators, Mrs. Milldollar and her son, which
                  made her fear for the life of the nobleman, whom she had learned to love with all
                  the fiery ardor of her Southern temperament.</p>
               <p>"Ah! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon Dieu! mon Dieu!</foreign> He comes not—he comes
                  not nevare more to me!" she sobbed. "They 'ave murdare him—they 'ave murdare
                  him!"</p>
               <p>And, with a shudder, she would close her eyes, as if to shut out some terrible
                  sight.</p>
               <p>Then, again, while her dark eyes flashed, and her bosom rose and fell with
                  excitement, like the waves of an angry sea, she would mutter fiercely:</p>
               <p>"If they 'ave murdare him, I will 'ave revenge! Zey shall find zat ze poor French
                  girl 'ave a strong arm when she strike for revenge!"</p>
               <p>A heavy footstep, approaching, caused her to raise her eyes.</p>
               <p>"It is not him; his walk is light, and full of grace—<emph>so</emph> genteel!" she
                  murmured.</p>
               <p>A portly, red-faced, rather important-looking gentleman entered, who made a short
                  stop, as he saw a female before him.</p>
               <p>"Good-evenin', ma'am!" said he, with a jerk of his head, intended for a bow.
                  "Good-evenin'! Where is his lordship?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, sare! I do not know! I 'ave wait for two, three, four long hours, and he
                  comes not—he comes not! Ah! if zey 'ave murdare him, I shall die!"</p>
               <p>"Murdered him! Who has murdered him?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, sare! I do not know!" sobbed the poor girl. "But a bad woman, and bad mens,

               <p>"Oh! you're the little French girl that I've heard Lord Tyrconnel speak of?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, sare! did my lord speak of <emph>me</emph>—of ME, poor Faralie? Was he so

               <p>"Yes; you are Mrs. Mildollar's maid!"</p>
               <p>"I 'ave been, sare; but nevare no more will I go to her! She is one bad woman—one

               <p>"A devil of a woman, as you say. But I must find out what has become of Lord

               <p>"Ah, sare! zen you are his friend?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; his particular friend. And, by the way, what is your name?"</p>
               <p>"Mam 'selle Faralie, sare!"</p>
               <p>"Well, Mam'selle Faralie, had you any news for his lordship?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sare; I hear madame and her son exult zat somezing zey meant to do wiz him

               <p>"Do you think that they meant to have him killed?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sare; I am sure of it!"</p>
               <p>"If he is not found by morning, will you take your oath to that belief, so that I

               <p>"Take my oat', sare? Excuse me; but I do not understand all ze English!"</p>
               <p>"Your oath on the Bible—be a witness?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, sare!—oh, yes! I shall be a witness! Any zing to recovare his life!"</p>
               <p>"Very well," said Mr. Grab; for this was<pb n="48-49 (Illustration) "

               <p>And Faralie went away, weeping.</p>
               <p>The officer paused a few moments, apparently thinking out a plan of action; and
                  then he went away, also.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head>
               <p>About an hour after Faralie had returned to the hotel of her mistress, and had
                  been dismissed for the night, on her plea of feeling very ill, the quiet <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">tête-à-tête</foreign>, only enlivened by a bottle of wine,
                  between Mrs. Mildollar and her son, was interrupted by the abrupt entrance of a
                  person whom Mrs. M. had never seen before, but whom Harry instantly recognized,
                  and introduced to her, as Captain Barrington.</p>
               <p>"You must hexcuse my hacting habruptly, ma'am!" said the captain; "but we've no
                  time to stand on ceremony now! If we do, it's all hup with us!"</p>
               <p>"Why, what is the matter?" inquired Mrs. M., turning pale, and trembling with
                  ill-suppressed terror. "Are our plans discovered—you made the attempt, and
                  failed?"</p>
               <p>"No; we 'aven't failed—we never failed! The doctor and the Irishman we've got and
                  done for; and the steward has gone on a whalin' voyage that he'll never get back
                  from, I reckon; and the cap'n never 'll get about again. Hif he does, he'll be as
                  he is now, stark crazy!"</p>
               <p>"Then what is the matter?"</p>
               <p>"Why, the police are hafter the doctor and his friend, and they'll be hafter you
                  and your son 'ere, if you 'aven't left hafore daylight. I come to warn you in
                  time, and to get my pay. One o' my men, Gentleman Bill, was in the Irishman's
                  room, a hover'auling his wardrobe, and the like, when a French girl came there,
                  and he 'ad to 'ide away hunder a bed! Well, she staid there for two or three
                  hours, till halong come old Grab—one of the Bow street hofficers; and it happears
                  that the girl belonged 'ere with you!"</p>
               <p>"What! Faralie?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, that was the name she 'ailed by."</p>
               <p>"The minx! can she have heard enough to betray us?"</p>
               <p>"She'd 'eard henough to want to put 'im—the Irish lord—on his guard; and the
                  hofficer hagreed with 'er, if he didn't find his two men hafore mornin' (which he
                  won't), to swear out a warrant hagainst you two in the mornin', and 'ave you
                  harrested."</p>
               <p>"O misery! what shall we do?" exclaimed Mrs. Mildollar.</p>
               <p>"Pay me hover the three thousand pounds hagreed upon for gettin' the three men
                  hout of your way; then hadd five 'undred more to it, and I'll see you put haboard
                  of a craft hafore daylight that'll take you hover to France; and from there you
                  can go to Hamerica and take possession of your fortune!" said Barrington,
                  coolly.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mildollar looked at her son beseechingly, as if she would ask his advice.</p>
               <p>"It's the honly way to do, ma'am; for if they harrest hany of us, we'd honly 'ave
                  to turn king's hevidence to git hoff; but 'twould go 'ard with you, seein' as 'ow
                  you're foreigners 'ere!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother, pay him, and let us be off. But don't take that French girl along;
                  let her stay," said Harry.</p>
               <p>"Yes, you can get haway from the 'otel without hanybody's knowin' it; and I'll see
                  that your baggage is sent hafter hevrything blows hover."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mildollar, without a further word of objection, hurried to get the money.
                  Before she paid the money, however, she asked:</p>
               <p>"How are we to know that you have put these men out of the way?"</p>
               <p>"Now you'll 'ave to take my word for it; but if you wait till mornin', you'll most
                  likely 'ear hof it loud henough. When the 'ue and cry is hup, you'll know it hif
                  you're in Hingland; for they hadvertises the description of hall that's
                  concerned."</p>
               <p>"Pay him, mother, pay him, and let him hurry the preparations for our departure,"
                  said Harry, whose cowardly heart was dreadfully terrified at the thought of an
                  arrest.</p>
               <p>His mother counted out the money—that required for the passage to France
                  included.</p>
               <p>"Hall's right! I shall be 'ere hagain hin habout two hours, to go a-ridin'—you
                  hunderstand? You'd better take your money, and such light stuff has you can
                  without hattractin' hattention; for the vessel will be hall ready, and my friend,
                  the captain of her, is a man that won't be kept waitin'."</p>
               <p>"We will be ready," said Mrs. M., as she dismissed the captain.</p>

               <p>"Yes, on a taut one, cap.; but I'll let him slide as soon as I've bled him a

                  believe you've followed 'im hout of love."-</p>
               <p>"That'll be easily done. He is as green as a goslin', and as vain as a
                  peacock!"</p>
               <p>"'Ere's a lot of flimsies—and a purse of gold, my gal. Use 'em freely and make 'em
                  pay. You can write to me hunder the old name, you know. You can 'ave Gentleman
                  Bill, if you want any 'elp."</p>
               <p>"I don't want help," said the girl. "Bill is all very good in his line, but he's
                  careless when he gets a drop too much in his head. I can do better by myself."</p>
               <p>"Is there hanything helse I can do for you, my girl?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing but to take good care of yourself, and don't let the coppers get hold of
                  you," said she.</p>
               <p>"Not much fear o' that. They're sharp, but when they get ahead of Clint.
                  Barrington he's forgot his trade. Old Grab thinks he's smart, but I've headed him
                  off an 'undred times. He'll be 'ere to-morrow, lookin' for the Yankee and his
                  friend; but I'll be as hinnocent as a lamb, and he can't disprove it. Hif he hever
                  finds 'em habove ground, he's smarter than he's showed up yet! But I'm a keepin'
                  you when time's waluable. The lugger lies down just below the bridge—you knew
                  where—by Jew David's old store-'ouse. Get haboard as soon as you can, but don't
                  let the woman or her goslin' know you're there, till you get to sea! I'm to meet
                  old Van Hetchell in a little while, and I'll let 'im know you're to be haboard.
                  Good-bye, dear!"</p>
               <p>"Good-bye, cap! If trouble crosses you, come over the water quick, to your Phone;
                  for we can <emph>live</emph> there. The Yankee coppers love money as well as our
                  own, and I know their ways. Good-bye, cap!"</p>
               <p>And the girl, with sighs of real affection, embraced and kissed him, while her
                  great, dark eyes were for a moment moistened with tears.</p>
               <p>"We'll take one glass hafore we part Phone!" said the captain; and his lip
                  quivered with feeling, as he spoke.</p>
               <p>The captain went to a closet and took a bottle down, which looked old and dusty,
                  and was sealed up. Drawing a dirk from beneath his vest, he knocked the top of the
                  bottle off, and poured out two brimming tumblers of the liquid, dark and clear as
                  a garnet.</p>
               <p>"That's more'n fifty years hold, my gal," said he, as he raised one glass to his
                  lips, while she took up the other. "'Ere's hall the luck you <emph>can</emph>
                  'ave, and a little hextra hif possible."</p>
               <p>They both drained their glasses.</p>
               <p>"That <emph>is</emph> stuff!" said the girl, while her veins seemed to send a
                  fuller tide up into her cheeks, and a brighter light flashed in her handsome eyes.
                  "Who'd drink wine when such lush as that could be had. But good-bye, cap.; I must
                  be at work if I'm to be off to-night!"</p>
               <p>"Good-bye, Phone. I'd like to say, God bless you, but somehow I'm afeared to hask
                  a blessin' from Him whose laws I break so hoften!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVII.</head>
               <p>The lugger Frau-der-Tuyvel was at sea, if that ever-boiling, treacherous,
                  shifting-currented space, known as the "British Channel," can be called "the sea."
                  She was a low, sharp, black, snakish, villainous-looking craft; and her crew,
                  mostly composed of silent, dirty, smoking Dutchmen, looked as if they were fit for
                  her. The only talkative man on board was the captain, Heinrich Van Hetchell, who
                  cursed and swore almost incessantly, and occupied all the rest of his time in
                  drinking schnapps and smoking. If he swore like a pirate, he looked like one. He
                  was a great, brawny, sun-browned man, with grizzly-gray hair and whiskers. His
                  sharp eyes looked fiercely out from beneath overhanging, cliff-like brows, and his
                  expression was scowling and repulsive.</p>
               <p>If he looked black, and his crew savage, and his craft devilish, the night and the
                  ocean were on equal footing with them all. Black, ragged clouds flew in ghostly
                  squads overhead; now and then leaving an opening for the red moon to look down
                  through their cavernous apertures. The wind blew strong, though in fitful gusts,
                  and the head-sea tossed and foamed<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6962-00000027"/> ed,
                  while the lugger pitched and bounded through and over it; sometimes under water,
                  and at others almost out of it.</p>
               <p>"Dunder and blitzen!" muttered old Van Hetchell, as he drew long whiffs from his
                  pipe, and looked to windward. "Dish is such a night as never was! Why can't I
                  never cross der channel mit a woman apoard, mit-out havin' a gale of wint?"</p>
               <p>Having thus given vent to his feeling against the fair sex whom he charged with
                  raising a gale, Van Hetchell told his mate to keep a look-out "mit both his eyes
                  open," while he went below to look at the chart.</p>
               <p>That was generally his excuse when he went down to take a glass of schnapps; any
                  one not knowing <emph>that</emph>, would have been led to think him a most careful
                  navigator; he looked at his chart so often.</p>
               <p>Upon entering the low, black cabin, darkened with "the dirt of ages," and many a
                  cloud of tobacco-smoke; the captain opened a little cupboard near the ladder, from
                  which he produced a huge square bottle of schnapps, and a pewter tankard,
                  calculated to hold a pint, or thereabouts. This he filled, with a steady hand, to
                  the brim, and drank it off.</p>
               <p>"Goot! Goot schnapps!" he muttered; and then he put the bottle down on the cabin
                  table, and seating himself by it, he proceeded to refill and light his pipe.</p>
               <p>While he was doing so, one of the dingy state-room doors opened, and the very pale
                  face of Mrs. Mildollar looked out from amid a mass of frizzled hair, looking like
                  a sickly moon peeping through the fog on a misty night.</p>
               <p>"O, captain! what makes the vessel jump so?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"Der wint and der water!" grunted the captain, looking sourer than <foreign
                     xml:lang="DEU">kraut</foreign>.</p>
               <p>"Are we in any danger? We must be!"</p>
               <p>"Yaw!" said Van Hetchell, and he blew a cloud of smoke from his huge pipe.</p>
               <p>"It does seem as if the vessel would break all to pieces!" continued Mrs.
                  Mildollar.</p>
               <p>"Yaw!" said the captain, catching the bottle, which a sudden lurch of the vessel
                  nearly pitched from the table.</p>
               <p>"I'm dreadfully sea-sick—what is good for it, captain?" continued the lady.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Schnapps!</emph>" said Van Hetchell, gruffly, as he poured out another mug
                  of the raw article and tossed it off.</p>
               <p>"Are we not near the land?" asked the lady; not heeding the rudeness of his
                  replies.</p>
               <p>"Yaw—a pig sight too near! Go to shleep, and maype you vakes up in a petter world
                  dan dish!"</p>
               <p>"Is there danger of our being wrecked?" cried another voice, from an opposite
                  state-room; and the pale face of Master Harry Corryell was stuck out from an
                  opening in the door, like the face of a calf looking through the air-hole of an
                  Erie Railroad cattle-car.</p>
               <p>"What's der matter mit <emph>you?</emph>" asked Van Hetchell, looking as if he
                  meant to smile if he could. "You look just like a sea-sick monkey mit a hant organ
                  pehint him!'</p>
               <p>The mate of the vessel, a square-built man, with a face that looked as if it had
                  been <choice>
                     <sic>huriedly</sic>
                     <corr>hurriedly</corr>
                  </choice> carved out of a wart-covered pumpkin, came down the ladder at this
                  moment, looking as if he had something to communicate, but felt in no very great
                  hurry to do it.</p>
               <p>"Take some schnapps, Hans!" said Van Hetchell, "and den tell me vat ish der matter
                  apove; vat makes you down here!"</p>
               <p>With great deliberation, the mate poured out a mug of schnapps and drank it, and
                  then said:</p>
               <p>"I dinks dere are preakers put a little vays perfore us. I dinks I heard 'em, und
                  dat was vat makes me down here to tell you!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Yaw?</emph> Well, you go on deck und wake up all de mens—und when I 'ave
                  drink an-odder schnaps und smoke mine pipe a little times, I will come up dere and
                  see what <emph>I</emph> hear!"</p>
               <p>"What! you take it so easy, and breakers are ahead?" cried Harry, scared almost to
                  death.</p>
               <p>"Yaw, we'll take it easy while we can. Pye-und-pye, maype, it'll come hard plen
                  enough?" said the phlegmatic skipper.</p>
               <p>"My God!—we will be lost—I can hear the breakers roaring now!" groaned Harry.</p>
               <p>"Then, my dear love, there is one comfort," said a pleasant, fearless voice—it
                  fell strangely familiar upon Harry's ear, and he turned to see a lovely face and
                  form just emerging from a state-room—"one comfort, <emph>dear</emph> Harry, we can
                  die together!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Miss Coutts!</emph>" cried Mrs. Mildollar, in surprise.</p>
               <p>"O <emph>Sophronia!</emph> YOU here?" cried Harry.</p>
               <p>"Yes—I learned, no matter how, that you were about to leave England forever, and
                  it was worse than death to endure the thought of parting with you and—and I am
                  here!"</p>
               <p>"Captain—der preakers is close apoard, on poth pows, and ahead!" said the mate,
                  still as cool as before, as he came partly down the cabin ladder, to report.</p>
               <p>"Well, den, you may as well come apout mit the lugger und get her head de odder
                  way!" said Van Hetchell, as he drank another cup of schnapps, and then followed
                  the mate on deck.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXVIII</head>
               <p>The skipper was almost immediately followed by his passengers, and terrific,
                  indeed, was the sight which met their eyes when they reached the deck. Though all
                  was dark above, the phosphorescence of the foaming waters lighted up things below,
                  and they could see a huge wall of black rock close at hand, against which the wild
                  breakers lashed fearfully. The lugger, under close-reefed tri-sails, had just come
                  up in the wind, her helm having been put a-lee; and now, as she was sidling in
                  toward the danger on the crest of a huge roller, it seemed uncertain whether she
                  would "come about," or whether she would "fall off" toward the shore. If the
                  former, there was some hope of her being able to work off from the shore; if the
                  latter, farewell to every chance for her or the lives of those on board.</p>
               <p>During this terrible moment of uncertainty, while Harry Corryell and his mother
                  were only speechless from intense horror, and even "Phone's" almost dauntless
                  heart was stilled in its lawless throbbings, Captain Van Hetchell quietly smoked
                  his pipe, and neither spoke nor exhibited the least change of countenance. At
                  last, the head of the foremost sail ceased to flap in the gale—the wind had caught
                  and filled it. Then, almost entirely buried, as it was, in foam, the lugger's bow
                  veered off to leeward, the after-sails filled just in time to save the vessel,
                  which was making stern-board from striking the rocks, and she plunged away madly
                  into the darkness again, free for the moment from a peril, near enough and
                  dreadful enough to strike terror into the stoutest heart.</p>
               <p>"Thank Heaven, we are clear of the rocks!" cried Mrs. Mildollar, as she stood
                  holding on to the rail at the companion-way, shivering from the cold spray which
                  had drenched her.</p>
               <p>"Petter tank Hans Van Pelt for seein' der preakers, and puttin' der lugger apout
                  in time!" growled the skipper, as he pushed by her, and went down into the cabin
                  to look at <emph>his</emph> chart again.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mildollar followed, and soon found her way into the state-room.</p>
               <p>"Wasn't it terrible?" asked Harry of "Phone," as soon as he dared to speak after
                  the danger was over.</p>
               <p>"No—only grand, almighty grand, as a true-blue Yankee would say!" said the girl.
                  "Harry, are you scared, my dear?"</p>
               <p>"Not <emph>exactly</emph> scared, Sophronia—but then I did feel a little nervous.
                  But I hope the worst is over. This is a terrible night. But now I have time to ask
                  why you are here!"</p>
               <p>"Does not your heart tell you, my dear Harry? Have I not loved you from the hour
                  we met?" said the artful siren, as she laid her hand on his arm, and looked into
                  his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Sophronia, you are a glorious girl," said the enraptured young man. "I thought
                  you loved me before; now I know it."</p>
               <p>"Yet you would have left me without a parting word," said the girl,
                  reproachfully.</p>
               <p>"I surely would have written, but the captain hurried us off with scarce a
                  moment's notice," said the young man.</p>
               <p>"I know it. It was well he did, or you and your mother would have been in prison.
                  But you'll be safe, now—that is, if we live to get ashore in France, for the
                  officers will never think of your going there."</p>
               <p>"And shall we be married, dear, when we get to France?" asked the anxious
                  youth.</p>
               <p>"I'm not in quite such a hurry as that!" said Phone, calmly. "Love is a sweet
                  thing—it is like cream on milk; and matrimony is apt to skim it off, I've heard!
                  At any rate, we'll wait till we get to America, and your mother enters on her
                  fortune. The old lady will be liberal with you, won't she?"</p>
               <p>"I reckon she will," said Harry. "If she isn't, I'll make her so! She'd be glad to
                  fork over, rather than I should expose her secrets!"</p>
               <p>"You wouldn't inform on your own mother, surely?" said Phone.</p>
               <p>"Not without she made me," cried Harry, not happening to notice the contempt in
                  tone and look with which she regarded him as she spoke.</p>
               <p>"Does she know who or what I am?" continued Phone.</p>
               <p>"No! She thinks that you are Miss Coutts, the daughter of the banker."</p>
               <p>"Well, let her be kept in the same way of thinking. My knowledge of French will
                  serve you in France; but if your mother is wise, her stay there will be short. The
                  French police work sharp on an English scent."</p>
               <p>"Everything shall be as you advise, my dear girl. <emph>I</emph> can manage my
                  mother—you only need to tell me what you wish her to do."</p>
               <p>"Very well, Harry. And now let us go below. I'm as wet as a drowned rat!"</p>

               <p>We left our friends, Watson and Tyrconnel, in rather a tight fix; and it is but
                  just to them and our readers, that we return and see how they get along there.</p>
               <p>Let me remember—ah! yes—the Irish peer had the "Red Slasher," <foreign

                  ears—and the doctor was about to cut his throat, when the sound of rapid footsteps
                  approaching overhead were heard.</p>
               <p>"Cut the villain's throat quick, doctor, if you're going to! His ears will come
                  loose if you don't!" said Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"What in thunder is going on 'ere?" cried a gruff voice above. "Slasher, you fool,
                  where's your 'ead?"</p>
               <p>"Save me, cap'n—save me, or I'm a goner," groaned the helpless wretch.</p>

               <p>Several men appeared to have grasped the Slasher by the heels; for while he yelled
                  with pain, he was forcibly drawn up from the grasp of Tyrconnel, who held on until
                  he found himself going up.</p>
               <p>"You're a purty pair of ducks, you here!" cried Barrington, angrily.</p>
               <p>"Yes—tolerable sound on looks. Hadn't<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6962-00000028"/> you
                  better come down and see us?" asked the peer.</p>
               <p>"No; you may come up here, though. Boys, hopen the trap, and put down the
                  ladder!"</p>
               <p>The door, or trap, above them was pushed aside, and a ladder put down, up which
                  the doctor and Tyrconnel ascended.</p>
               <p>"Be careful not to expose the fact that we are armed, till we have a chance to use
                  the weapons," whispered the doctor, to his friend, as they ascended.</p>
               <p>They only had time to see that a dozen or more of rough-looking, lawless men were
                  around them, when, before they could offer any resistance, they were seized, and
                  their arms bound behind them.</p>
               <p>"By what right do you treat us so?" asked Watson, indignantly.</p>
               <p>"Where <emph>might</emph> is, <emph>right</emph> hisn't halways questioned," said
                  the captain, with a smile.</p>
               <p>"You're the cove what pulled my hears, aren't you? Take that, from the Slasher!"
                  cried that indignant individual, hitting Tyrconnel a "stinger" on the cheek, with
                  the flat of his brawny hand.</p>
               <p>"By me sowl, you'd repent that, you dirty coward, if my hands were free!" cried
                  the angry peer.</p>
               <p>"You hought to be hashamed of yourself for striking a man when his hands are
                  tied!" said the captain, rebukingly.</p>
               <p>"Huntie 'is 'ands and I'll 'it 'im hagain," said the Slasher, moodily.</p>
               <p>"Do, captain, and by me sowl I'll stand still to have 'em tied again, as soon as
                  I've given him a taste of my fist."</p>
               <p>"Good—a mill, a mill!" cried several of the men.</p>
               <p>"Very well. You shall 'ave one. Bring 'em hinto the square room, and lock the
                  doors be'ind you," said the captain, leading the way.</p>
               <p>The doctor and his angry friend were at once conducted into a large square room,
                  furnished with a long table and a number of rude benches and chairs—a room
                  evidently used by the looks of the table, for a meeting and drinking-room by the
                  gang. There was no window to it—it was lighted by a dingy lamp which hung from the
                  ceiling, and by the candles held by the men.</p>
               <p>The table and seats were in a moment removed from the centre of the room, the men,
                  proving by their haste, their anxiety to see the "mill."</p>
               <p>"He's a 'ard chap to 'andle, and I'd had-vise you not to try 'im," said the
                  captain, rather kindly, to Tyrconnel. "You've got a rather 'andsome face, and
                  'twere a pity to 'ave it spoiled!"</p>
               <p>"Reserve the salve of your pity till you see whose physiognomy suffers the most.
                  Untie me if you intend to!" said Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>The captain made no reply, but untied his hands, while the Slasher stripped to the
                  waist, and stepped out into the middle of the room, whither he was quickly
                  followed by Tyrconnel, who had merely laid aside his coat.</p>
               <p>The parties looked most unequally matched, in a physical point of view. The
                  Slasher was a huge, muscular giant, long-armed and broad-chested, with a thick
                  bull-neck and a round head, which looked hard enough to serve a blacksmith for an
                  anvil. His repulsive face was seamed with many a pugilistic scar, and his one eye
                  gleamed vindictively upon his antagonist; while his short, red hair stood erect,
                  like bristles on the back of an angry boar.</p>
               <p>The figure of Tyrconnel was about as tall as that of his antagonist, but far more
                  slender. Yet it was well-knit, elegant in shape, and showed considerable muscle,
                  which had been well developed by judicious exercise.</p>
               <p>The attitude which he took as he confronted the Slasher, showed that he had "taken
                  lessons" in the "art;" and his calm eye and confident look rather re-assured the
                  doctor, who had felt faint-hearted when he looked upon the immense proportions of
                  the other.</p>
               <p>"Come on! I'm a waitin' for yer!" said the giant, with a brutal grin.</p>
               <p>The words were hardly out of his mouth, before he received the "left" of Tyrconnel
                  so fairly between the eyes, that he had a <emph>stellated</emph> view of the
                  universe for nothing, and very nearly turned a back somersault as he went down to
                  the floor.</p>
               <p>"Game, by 'okee!" muttered the captain, while Tyrconnel, who had struck without
                  any apparent over-exertion, quietly waited for his opponent to rise.</p>
               <p>This the latter seemed in no hurry to do, until several of the gang cried out
                  "time," when he got up and rushed at Tyrconnel, with a bulky fierceness which
                  seemed to be sure to overwhelm him.</p>
               <p>But again the peer met him fairly, this time with right and left, one between the
                  eyes and the other under his left ear, sending him down like a log to the
                  floor.</p>
               <p>This time he neither got up nor moved, until, by direction of the captain, some of
                  his mates took means, with water and a bottle of rum, to revive him.</p>
               <p>"You 'it 'ard! I'd as soon 'ave a 'orse kick me!" said the captain, to Tyrconnel,
                  speaking without any vindictiveness.</p>
               <p>"'Ave you 'ad henough?" he asked, after the Slasher had been restored to a state
                  of consciousness.</p>
               <p>"Yes—he's a stunner!" muttered the defeated giant. "He's the honly man in the
                  Three Kingdoms that could lay <emph>me</emph> hout in two rounds, though!"</p>
               <p>"Now, gentlemen, you can take a walk with me into my private hapartment, where,
                  hafter you've refreshed yourselves a bit, we'll settle our haccounts, and see
                  what's to be done with you. But first, I'll borrow the little trinkets you 'ave
                  habout you, for fear 'arm might come hof 'em."</p>
               <p>And with a dexterity which only long use could have given him, the captain in a
                  moment took the pistols, knives, watches, and purses from the doctor and his
                  friend, and put them in his own capacious pockets.</p>
               <p>This done, he preceded them into a smaller room, where he dismissed the other men,
                  with one exception, bidding them see that no strangers entered the house while he
                  was engaged.</p>
               <p>"You'll bring in <emph>that</emph> wine and brandy, and something to heat, Sam!"
                  said he, to the man whom he had directed to remain.</p>
               <p>"We want no refreshments—we want our liberty," said the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Be heavy, sir. It's hagainst my <choice>
                     <sic>princiciples</sic>
                     <corr>principles</corr>
                  </choice> to talk business with men on a hempty stomach; so, if you don't choose
                  to heat and drink like men, why, you can go down cellar hagain, hand wait till you
                  feel 'ungry."</p>
               <p>"Oh! if you'll talk reason after we've eaten and drank with you," cried Tyrconnel,
                  "we'll be satisfied!"</p>
               <p>"That's right—you're a trump in a full 'and," said the captain, admiringly; while
                  the man went out for the articles which he had ordered.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XL.</head>
               <p>The man who had been sent out brought in several bottles of wine and liquor on a
                  large tray, and silver cups to drink from, and placed two of them before Tyrconnel
                  and the doctor and the other before the captain.</p>
               <p>Opening a bottle of wine, the captain filled the cups of his involuntary guests
                  and then his own; and as he raised his cup to his lips, said:</p>
               <p>"'Ere's to you 'aving better luck next time, gentlemen."</p>
               <p>As he drank from the same bottle, no suspicion of the wine being drugged ever
                  crossed the minds of the doctor or his friend—nor even the thought that an opiate
                  could easily have been concealed at the bottom of their cups before they were
                  filled; and wishing to propitiate him as much as they could, they partook of the
                  wine without any hesitation.</p>
               <p>The doctor noticed a peculiarity in its flavor, and with a suspicion quickened by,
                  and peculiar to his profession, alluded to it.</p>
               <p>"The wine is hold, that's hall!" said the captain, filling a second goblet for
                  himself and drinking it off. "Fill hup hagain, gents; fill hup and be
                  sociable."</p>
               <p>"I don't like the wine!" said the doctor, upon whom a strange feeling was coming
                  so fast, that he felt almost sure the wine had been drugged.</p>
               <p>"Then try the brandy!" said the generous chief of the burglars.</p>
               <p>"Faith <emph>I</emph> will; for the wine had a kind of butter-milk taste that I
                  didn't like," said Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"Do not touch a drop of his liquor—that wine was drugged; I feel the effects
                  plainly!" said Watson.</p>
               <p>"Drugged, dy'e say?" said Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"Hit's no such thing! Don't you see me drinking from the same bottle?" cried
                  Barrington, angrily.</p>
               <p>"To be—sure—he is! Doc—doctor, you must be mistaken!" said Tyrconnel with a
                  yawn.</p>
               <p>"Mistaken? Why, you are half asleep already!" cried the doctor. "Drink a full cup
                  of brandy as I do—it may counteract the effects of the opiate, for an opiate of
                  some kind we have taken.</p>
               <p>Both the doctor and Tyrconnel drank full cups of brandy, while a grim smile of
                  satisfaction stole over Barrington's face.</p>
               <p>"The wine would have done it alone," he muttered, "but the brandy has doubled the
                  dose!"</p>
               <p>And so it proved; for in spite of their efforts to keep awake, both the doctor and
                  his companion were in a sound slumber in a few moments—so sound, that a fall from
                  their chairs to the floor produced no awakening effect on them.</p>
               <p>"They're hin for it now!" said Barrington with a smile. "The sooner Cap'n Tubbs
                  comes, the better now."</p>
               <p>He had hardly uttered the words, before the man who had waited on him entered, and
                  said:</p>
               <p>"There's a man in the tap-room, who says you've sent for him, and he's 'ere,
                  cap'n!"</p>
               <p>"What kind of a look 'as he?"</p>
               <p>"He looks summat as hif he'd been dropped into a tan vat, and then got dried in a
                  smoke 'ouse!" said Sam.</p>
               <p>"Short built?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; hand thick as a 'ogs'ead o' rum!"</p>
               <p>"That's him! ask him if his name is Tubbs. If he says yes, bring him here. But
                  first and foremost take these bottles away, and bring others with the reglar stuff
                  in 'em. The sleepin' stuff has worked, you see!"</p>
               <p>"Yes sir, hand hamazin' quick!" said Sam, as he carried out the bottles.</p>
               <p>He returned in a few moments, bearing a couple more bottles, with glasses, and
                  ushering a man, answering very well to his rather original description—one whose
                  dress and looks both betokened his occupation to be that of a seaman.</p>
               <p>He started back as he entered, for he saw the forms of Watson and Tyrconnel on the
                  floor, and evidently, at the first glance, supposed them to be victims of foul
                  play.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Dead men</emph>?" he asked, with a shudder.</p>
               <p>"No, you green-'orn!" said Barrington. with a laugh. "You're a cute 'un, Cap'n
                  Tubbs, not to know a drunken man from a dead 'un!"</p>
               <pb n="56-57 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6962-00000029"/>
               <p>"Oh—drink—that's all!" said Captain Tubbs, looking again at them, and then taking
                  the seat offered him by Sam.</p>
               <p>"I s'pose you sent for me to see if I could not pay up part of what I owed you,
                  before I sailed, Clint!" said Captain Tubbs, rather uneasily, as he sat down.</p>
               <p>"I've hendeavored to <emph>prove</emph> myself a friend to you, Bill Tubbs,
                  'aven't I?" said Barrington.</p>
               <p>"You have, and I shall never forget you. You saved my wife and children from the
                  next thing to starvation, when I was where I could not help 'em; and when I came
                  back a poor, wrecked, and broken-down man, you put me on my pins again, and it's
                  owing to you that I'm in another ship, and ready for another trip," said Captain
                  Tubbs, warmly.</p>
               <p>"You see, Tubbs, what I 'ave done hon haccount of our hold haccquaintance hand
                  friendship, since hever we were boys! Hand I stand ready to do as much more
                  whenhever hit's needed."</p>
               <p>"God bless you, Clint—God bless you! I'm sorry you make your living in the way you
                  do, but it is not for me to blame you. I only hope you'll keep clear of the
                  law-sharks, and have the power and inclination to lay up in a snug harbor, out of
                  danger, and that soon."</p>
               <p>"Thank'ee, Bill—thank'ee kindly, cause I know as 'ow you mean well. I ham what I
                  ham, and I can't be no t other now! A hegg that's once <unclear>spiled</unclear>
                  can't never be fresh hagain. But that's neither 'ere nor there! I saw that your
                  ship was cleared for a whalin' voyage to the South Seas; hand I saw a chance
                  w'ereby you might do me a great favor, and save me from committin' a great crime,
                  without 'urtin' yourself the least possible!"</p>
               <p>"Explain yourself, Clint! Anything I <emph>can</emph> do for you, you
                     <emph>know</emph> I will!"</p>
               <p>"Gives' your 'hand on that, Bill!" said Clint, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Providing that you don't mean nothing that is criminal!" added Captain Tubbs, as
                  he reached out his hand.</p>
               <p>"Didn't I say 'twas to pervent my doin' a crime?" said Barrington, rather
                  testily.</p>
               <p>"Well, out with it man. I owe you too much to refuse you any favor that is in my
                  power to grant."</p>
               <p>"You see them two chaps there on the floor?" said Barrington.</p>
               <p>A nod of the head signified that Captain Tubbs <emph>did</emph> see them.</p>
               <p>"They're hasleep, and will be for the next four-and-twenty hours," continued
                  Barrington.</p>
               <p>"I thought you said they were drunk!" said Tubbs, looking at them with a glance of
                  distrust.</p>
               <p>"Well, so they be; but there was somethin' in the grog they drank that put 'em
                  hasleep hafore they knowed it. I know you won't peach on me. Bill, so I'll tell
                  you hall habout it. These 'ere chaps was in the way of a woman—an Hamerican
                  woman—and she 'ired me to get rid of 'em for her! Now, I've took the job, and she
                  thinks I'll kill 'em, and pays me hacordingly."</p>
               <p>"But you won't?" cried Tubbs, with a look of horror.</p>
               <p>"I don't want to, and if you'll 'elp me, I won't," said Barrington. "When I saw
                  your ship up in Lloyds' list for sailing, the hidea struck me that, with your
                  'elp, I might get the money, and save the gentlemen's lives. Says I to myself,
                  there's Bill Tubbs, whom I've known hever since we wore bibs and played in the mud
                  together. He's got a good 'art, and 'll 'elp me hout of the scrape, when I show
                  'im there'll be no 'arm done, specially when I give him the 'alf of a thousand
                  pounds to make his folks the more heasy with, while he's gone to sea!"</p>
               <p>"How can I help you, Clint, without doing wrong myself?"</p>
               <p>"Why, you know of some pretty hisland or hother, hall halone by hitself haway hoff
                  in them South seas, where a couple or three fellers could live forever without
                  starvin' or freezin', don't you?"</p>
               <p>"There are such islands—some with Indians on 'em, some without," said Tubbs,
                  thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"Hisn't there one as you knows of, where there's no Indians, and where ships won't
                  be likely to stop?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—I like to have been lost on one last voyage not laid down on any chart. I
                  took its position down, and run into a bay in it, and got wood, and water, and
                  fruit."</p>
               <p>"That's hit—that's hit!" cried Barrington. "The very place. Now, Bill, if you'll
                  take them 'ere chaps, hand hanother one that I've got in a like fix, to hact as a
                  servant for 'em—if you'll take them as passengers, hand leave 'em hon that
                  hisland, I'll plank down five 'undred pounds, and be more hobliged to you than you
                  hever was to me."</p>
               <p>Tubbs looked perplexed, and shook his head, gloomily.</p>
               <p>"Clint, I'd do almost anything for you; but, you see, this would be abduction, or
                  something of that sort; and if the law-sharks got hold of me, transportation would
                  be the least I'd get."</p>
               <p>"But they wouldn't get a 'old of you. The honly witnesses would be there on that
                  hisland, while you'd be hoff on the hocean, and your family living like 'ares hin
                  a clover-field at 'ome."</p>
               <p>The last argument was a powerful one with Captain Tubbs. Like those of most
                  seamen, his home attachments were strong, all the more fervent for the frequent
                  and long deprivations of an opportunity to enjoy them.</p>
               <p>"What could I say to them, when they came to be themselves, and found out that
                  they were at sea?" he asked, thoughtfully.</p>

               <p>"Aren't you cap'n aboard of your hown ship, Bill? Won't it be heasy to show 'em
                  that you are?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; if I take it into my head to do so, they'll know I'm captain."</p>
               <p>"Well, Bill, it's for you to say. If you'll take 'em, I'll 'ave 'em haboard in
                  less time than 'twill take hus to hempty a bottle of wine. If you won't, why it's

               <p>"You'll pay me five hundred pounds now, if I'll do it?" asked Tubbs.</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>"Then, Clint, for my family's sake, to save you from doing a murder, and for the
                  good you have done for me and mine, I'll do it, though it roughs the edge of my
                  conscience a good deal, I tell you! Get 'em on board as soon as you can, for I
                  shall slip out on the morning's ebb. I don't want to be laying around here with
                  them on board, you may be sure."</p>
               <p>"Have them aboard as soon as you can—I shall just run over and see Mary and say
                  goodbye, and then I'm off," said Tubbs, as he received the money.</p>
               <p>"I'll do that, for I want 'em hoff my 'ands hafore the hofficers over'aul the
                  crib," said Barrington.</p>
               <p>The bargain was made while its victims lay as unconscious as the "Seven Sleepers,"

               <p>Mr. Grab, of Bow street, was generally very punctual in his engagements, but poor
                  Faralie had been sobbing and weeping for over two hours in the deserted quarters
                  of Lord Tyrconnel before the first-named individual found his way to her side.</p>
               <p>"'Ave you seen my lord—'ave you heard of heem?" asked the distressed girl, as soon
                  as the officer entered the room.</p>
               <p>"No—not yet," said Mr. Grab. "What news have you?"</p>
               <p>"Madame and her son have disappeared from the hotel in the night, and are not
                  nowhere to be found. Madam left for me a note upon her table, saying I was a
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">traitoreuse</foreign> to her, and I might whistle for
                  my wages—the monster! As if a lady could whistle! But I do not care that I lose my

               <p>"Things look squally," muttered the officer. "I must put more hands to work—if

               <p>"What shall I do wiz myself, Messieur? I cannot live at ze hotel wizout

                  you shan't suffer for a home as long as me and my Susannah have one. You'll like
                  Susannah. She's solid—she is! Weighs two hundred and twenty, and hasn't a bit more

               <p>The ship Jonah, William Tubbs, captain, bound on a voyage after sperm whales in
                  the South Seas, was pitching and rolling before a fresh easterly gale, and driving
                  out of the Channel as fast as she could, with all the canvas she could carry, on
                  the day after that when her captain had concluded his bargain with Barrington.</p>
               <p>And the "salt air appeared" to have excited his thirst in a slight degree; for
                  Captain Tubbs was in the act of "freshening his nip" from an ancient-looking
                  square bottle, that spoke Dutch almost—so Hollandic was its build—when a head
                  protruded from a stateroom in the cabin where he was, and from it, in a rich
                  Celtic brogue, came these words:</p>
               <p>"Can you tell me where I am, you man over the bottle?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! Woke up, eh?" muttered Mr. Tubbs to himself. Then, in a louder tone, he
                  added: "Yes. You are at sea, on board the whale-ship Jonah, William Tubbs (and
                  that means me), master."</p>
               <p>"The Jonah—a whaler? Sure, am I draming? I know <emph>ould</emph> Jonah went
                  a-whaling; but why Terrence Tyrconnel should follow his example is more than I can
                  see into. Your name is Tubbs, you say?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"You're one of the Tubbs that can stand on its own bottom, I should think,
                  then."</p>
               <p>"I am, sir. That's a pretty good idea. Won't you join me in a glass?"</p>
               <p>"Wait till I bite my finger, to see whether I'm awake or not. Och, botheration to
                  the sharp teeth in my head!—I'm awake, by the blood of my fathers! Why—let me see:
                  I was drinking in a rascally crib in London the last I can remember. What the
                  deuce am I doing here?"</p>
               <p>"Asking questions, just now."</p>
               <p>"So I am. But how came I here?"</p>
               <p>"Your friends brought you here."</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6962-00000031"/>
               <p>"My friends? Not a friend had I who'd be takin the trouble."</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, you had. They brought you, and your doctor, and servant, and paid your
                  passage to Lookoheva, in the South Seas."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Tubbs—"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Captain</emph> Tubbs, on board my own ship!" said that individual, with a
                  tone of dignity.</p>
               <p>"Then, '<emph>Captain</emph> Tubbs, aboord your own ship'—what do you mane by this
                  yarn you're spinning?"</p>
               <p>"I mean to state facts—neither more nor less. Your friends brought you and your
                  doctor and servant on board of my ship, just before she sailed, and paid your
                  passage to Lookoheva—and there I shall land you. They said you were out of your
                  head at times, and imagined yourself an Irish lord, and that the sea-voyage, and a
                  few months' residence in Lookoheva were all that you needed to restore you to
                  health."</p>
               <p>"They did, did they? How did they account for bringing me aboord in my slape?"</p>
               <p>"They said you were drunk; and I didn't think they were much out of their
                  reckoning in that!"</p>
               <p>"You didn't? But where's the doctor you spake of?"</p>
               <p>"In that room next to you, forward."</p>
               <p>Tyrconnel opened the state-room door to which Tubbs pointed, and saw Watson in a
                  berth, still asleep.</p>
               <p>"There is the doctor," he muttered.</p>
               <p>"Didn't I tell you so? Next time, you'll believe me," said Captain Tubbs, drinking
                  off the gin and sugar which he had just mixed. "You'd better take a drink, sir,
                  and be sociable. We've a long voyage before us, and might better be friends than
                  enemies."</p>
               <p>"There's truth in the last, if the first is a certainty—which I hope it isn't. So
                  I'll take a glass, and then see if I can't wake up the doctor."</p>
               <p>"Was there a female woman among the <emph>friends</emph> you've been talking
                  about, <emph>Captain</emph> Tubbs?"</p>
               <p>"I believe there was, though I didn't see her."</p>
               <p>"O the haythen! That thafe o' the wurruld. Misthress Mildollar, is at the bottom
                  of all this. There's a mistake in the matter, captain: and I think, when it's
                  explained, you'll put us ashore."</p>
               <p>"There's no mistake about your passage being paid, and undoubtedly I'll put you
                  ashore when the passage is made When William Tubbs, master of the ship Jonah
                  (commonly known as Bill Tubbs, the whaleman), makes a bargain, it's as safe as a
                  sperm whale with the iron into his life! You and your friends will go to Lookoheva
                  just as sure as this ship makes the run without sinking! There's no use in talking
                  any other way! I'm always willing to argue a point that's got two roads to it, but
                  this hasn't."</p>
               <p>"Can you tell me where this Lookoheva is that you're telling me of?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes. It's in latitude 13° south, and longitude 43° west—or very near
                  that."</p>
               <p>"What! an island in the South Seas?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—one of my own discovery. I called it Lookoheva, because it looked some like
                  Nookoheva, where I'd watered ship three or four weeks before."</p>
               <p>"What kind of people live on it? Cannibals, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"There was nothing there but a few wild hogs; and how they got there, it puzzles
                  me to think."</p>
               <p>"By me sowl, a most inviting prospect! I must try and wake up the doctor, and see
                  how he'll enjoy the news!"</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XLIII.</head>
               <p>"Doctor, doctor dear!" cried Tyrconnel, as he shook Watson's shoulder; "wake up,
                  will ye, and find yerself inside of Jonah, the whaler."</p>
               <p>"It's drugged—I know it's drugged!" muttered the yet unconscious physician</p>
               <p>"Wake up, doctor, and hear a story. It's Robinson Crusoes we're to be; and you can
                  kape a drug-store, and I'll be your patron as long as you sell anything good to
                  drink—I'll cling to you as close as a Maine deacon to his town agent!"</p>
               <p>The doctor, so roughly shaken, began to show strong signs of waking, and with an
                  uneasy moan, he turned over, and would have rolled out of the berth, had not
                  Tyrconnel prevented it.</p>
               <p>"Aisy—aisy there, doctor dear! When you rowl on your own axis, don't think
                  yourself the wurruld, or you'll rowl out of your sphere."</p>
               <p>"What's the matter?—where in creation am I?" muttered the doctor, as he opened his
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"Nowhere in creation, but here aboord of Jonah, doctor dear! Come out o' that, and
                  then I'll help you to study out the diagnosis of our case."</p>
               <p>"Are you crazy, Tyrconnel, or I—or both? It seems to me that we are at sea!"</p>
               <p>"And so it seems to me; and if there's any truth in the words of
                     <emph>Captain</emph> Bill Tubbs aboord his own ship, we'll be at sea some time
                  before we see land; and when we see land, it'll be many a mile from it we'll pray
                  to be."</p>
               <p>"How came we here?" said the doctor, who could not comprehend a word that
                  Tyrconnel had spoken.</p>
               <p>"Captain Bill Tubbs aboord his own ship says our friends brought us here. I think
                  the ould cat o' brimstone, Mildollar, is at the bottom of it. The poor little
                  French girl, with the nagur blood in her veins, will go demented intirely when she
                  finds out that we've been spirited out of sight and hearing as much as if we were
                  dead and buried."</p>
               <p>"We are at sea, then?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure. Don't you feel the ship rowl and pitch like a shaky cart on a rough
                  road?"</p>
               <p>"What ship?"</p>
               <p>"The whale-ship Jonah—Capt. Bill Tubbs, when he's on boord."</p>
               <p>"What are we doing here?"</p>
               <p>"Faith, you can answer that as well as I. But turn out, and take a drop to wake
                  you up, and maybe we can find out the particulars from Capt. Bill Tubbs, aboord
                  his own ship."</p>
               <p>The doctor could not refuse attentions so kindly offered; and he managed to get on
                  to his feet, and to walk out into the main cabin, where Capt. Tubbs was leisurely
                  sipping a glass of gin.</p>
               <p>"That is Capt. Bill Tubbs aboord his own ship," said Tyrconnel to the doctor.
                  "And, Capt. Bill Tubbs, aboord your own ship, this is Dr. Watson, Prince of New
                  York, in the United States of America."</p>
               <p>"By Moses! the man is crazy, after <unclear>all,</unclear>" muttered the captain
                  to himself. Then he acknowledged the introduction by a bow as short as the nod of
                  an automaton <unclear>mandarin</unclear> and, pushing a glass over toward the
                  doctor, pointed to the bottle, and said that he hoped he would help himself, and
                  feel quite at home.</p>
               <p>"First, I'd like to know how I came here," said the doctor, as he sat down.</p>
               <p>"You were brought here," said Captain Tubbs.</p>
               <p>"So I suppose; but how?"</p>
               <p>"You were brought alongside in a boat, and over the side by your friends; for all
                  three of you were too drunk—or sleepy, if you like the word better—to help
                  yourselves."</p>
               <p>"All three of us! Who else is on board?"</p>
               <p>"Is it the French girl with the nagur blood in her veins?" asked Tyrconnel,
                  excitedly.</p>
               <p>"There he lays on the transom bench," said Capt. Tubbs, pointing aft.</p>
               <p>"Why, it's the steward of the Merlin!" said Watson, in surprise.</p>
               <p>"Yes; the poor fellow was a witness to the will. I can see through the whole plot
                  now! That ould bundle o' sin, Mrs. Mildollar, has got us out o' the way so that
                  she can go back and enjoy her fortune."</p>
               <p>"But surely the captain is not a party to her villainy!" said the doctor. "You
                  look like an honest, well-meaning man, sir," he continued, to the captain.</p>
               <p>"I believe I am, sir," said Capt. Tubbs. And he hastily swallowed his glass of
                  gin, and said he must go on deck to see how matters went there.</p>
               <p>"But hold on a minute, sir," said the doctor. "I'd like to talk with you for a few
                  moments, and to show you how much better it would be for you to run your ship into
                  the nearest harbor, and there to land us."</p>
               <p>"As I told your friend, I never object to arguing a point that has two roads to
                  it; but this hasn't. Your passages are paid, and there's an end to it," said
                  Captain Tubbs, firmly.</p>
               <p>"But let me show you that there are two roads in the matter: one is black with
                  crime; the other is light as day—and we will brighten it with gold. You commit a
                  crime if you carry us off against our will; but if you land us, we will pay you
                  well, and all will be right."</p>
               <p>"No; all wouldn't be right. I've taken money, and agreed to carry you to a certain
                  point; and there you go, just as sure as my name is William Tubbs—commonly called
                  Bill Tubbs, the whaleman."</p>
               <p>"But, Mr. Tubbs—" continued the doctor.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Captain</emph> Tubbs, aboord his own ship," said Tyrconnel, correcting
                  him.</p>
               <p>"I must go on deck, gentlemen; and let me say, once for all, that all talk or
                  argument with me on this subject is useless. If you'll make yourselves
                  comfortable, and be quiet, we'll get along well together; if you do not, at will
                  be the worse for you, as sure as my name is Bill Tubbs!" said the captain, as he
                  left the cabin.</p>
               <p>"<unclear>Aboard</unclear> your own ship, why didn't ye add, you
                     <unclear>ould</unclear> son of a sea-cook!" muttered Tyrconnel bitterly. "What
                  do you mane to do, doctor dear?" he added.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLIV.</head>
               <p>Some three or four weeks had elapsed since good Dr. Watson had kissed little
                  Elfrida, and bade farewell to her excellent guardians, Betsy and Jonathan
                  Birdsall—who each night and morning remembered him in their prayers, and besought
                  Him who holds all power to carry him safely over the ocean, and in good time to
                  bring him back to his native land.</p>
               <p>One evening about this time, just as the old man was closing his shop for the
                  night, a man wrapped in a large cloak, with a felt hat drawn down over his brow,
                  entered.</p>
               <p>"What do you want in our line, sir?" asked the old man, supposing him to be a
                  customer wishing a cigar, or some other little matter.</p>
               <p>"Shut up your shop. I want to see my child, old man. Shut up your shop; for I
                  don't want to be disturbed by visitors."</p>
               <p>Birdsall at once recognized his visitor—Gerald Andros.</p>
               <p>"Go inside, cap'n; go into t'other room, and my Betsy will show you the little
                  beauty—it's asleep in its cradle—or, if you'll wait half a minute, I'll go with
                  you."</p>
               <p>Andros made no reply, but stood until the old man had shut his windows and
                  door—when he threw his cloak aside, and lifted the hat from over his brows.</p>
               <p>Birdsall led the way into the inner room, and Andros followed.</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6962-00000032"/>
               <p>"Betsy," said the old man, "here is our little Elfy's father, come to see
                  her."</p>
               <p>"So it is!" said the old lady, raising her eyes from the Bible which she was
                  reading, and taking off her spectacles. "So it is! Sit down, sir."</p>
               <p>And she brushed a dustless chair with her apron, and placed it for him.</p>
               <p>But he did not sit down. With a single stride, he crossed the little room, and
                  stood beside the cradle which contained his motherless child.</p>
               <p>There it lay, the little angel-bud of humanity, breathing as softly as a flower,
                  and looking as if sorrow ought not ever to cross its spotless path. And while the
                  strong man looked down upon it, his frame quivered with emotion, and his great,
                  fierce eyes lost their wild light, and became dewy.</p>
               <p>He knelt down, and pressed his lips to the child's sweet face. It woke, and a look
                  of terror told him that to it he was a stranger. He attempted to take it in his
                  arms, but its cries of fear brought Mother Birdsall to the cradle; and when she
                  took it and caressed it, the little thing hid its face in her bosom and hushed at
                  once.</p>
               <p>"She won't be so timersome of you, sir, when she gets older. But she never sees
                  any strangers, you see, and she gets scared easy," said the old lady, in a quiet
                  tone.</p>
               <p>"It may be a long time before she sees me again," said Andros, gloomily. "I am
                  going far away from America, and do not know that I shall ever return. But if I do
                  not, she will be well cared for. She will be rich and happy—all the happier that
                  she does not know her unhappy father! Is there any way that you can get her into a
                  very sound sleep?"</p>
               <p>"Why, what do you want to do?" asked the old lady, suspiciously. "You don't think
                  of carrying her off, do you? No, no—we couldn't bear that! I couldn't spare her—I
                     <emph>couldn't</emph> spare her!"</p>
               <p>"I shall never take her from your care," said Andros, quietly. "I wish you and
                  Doctor Watson to watch over her until she is of an age to act for herself; and
                  then I know that she will never drive such good friends away."</p>
               <p>"Doctor Watson has gone to Europe," said the old man.</p>
               <p>"I know it," replied Andros. "But he will soon return, and bring you good news
                  about your pet. Her grandfather is dead, and has left her all his property."</p>
               <p>"Old Mildollar dead?" asked Jonathan, doubtfully.</p>
               <p>"Yes; and in his last hours he made amends for his cruelty to that poor child's
                  mother—so far as he could. But Doctor Watson will tell you all when he comes
                  back."</p>
               <p>"Have you seen him since he left?" asked the old lady.</p>
               <p>"Yes; I saw him at sea! But you have not answered a question a asked you, some
                  time ago. Is there no way in which you can get the baby into a very sound
                  sleep?"</p>
               <p>"I can give it paregoric; but I must first know what you want to do to it."</p>
               <p>"I want to put a mark on it, so that if any accident happens to you, or it should
                  ever get lost, it may be found and recognized."</p>
               <p>"That's a good idea—I like it; for sometimes children do get lost in the city, and
                  sometimes they're stolen by the worthless beggars that prowl around, to help them
                  do their begging, I've known more than one such case in my life-time," said
                  Jonathan.</p>
               <p>"How 'll you mark it?" asked the old lady.</p>
               <p>"With Indian ink, just as my name is marked on my arm," said Andros, baring his
                  right arm as he spoke, and showing his own name marked there, beneath a
                  well-defined American eagle.</p>
               <p>"It's curious. Won't it hurt?" asked the old lady.</p>
               <p>"Not if she is asleep. I'll do it carefully," said Andros.</p>
               <p>"Then I'll give her the paregoric; for as Jonathan says, it's a good idea. We're
                  getting old, and when she gets to running about, she might get out of our sight.
                  But if she does, it sha'n't be for want of watching."</p>
               <p>And the old lady went to the closet and got the paregoric, a few drops of which
                  she gave to the child.</p>
               <p>In a short time, its regular and heavy breathing showed that the drug had taken
                  effect; and while the old lady held it tenderly in her arms, Andros bared its arm
                  to the shoulder, and between the elbow and shoulder, with a bit of moistened India
                  ink, drew in plain letters the name ELFRIDA. Then, with an instrument formed of
                  sharp-pointed needles, he pricked over the spots darkened with the ink, and in a
                  short time the operation was complete.</p>
               <p>"It looks cruel. I'm so glad it's done," said the old lady, as Andros put away the
                  articles which he had used. "Won't it never come out?"</p>
               <p>"No—it is indelible. Wash it off now, and put on some simple salve, to relieve its
                  soreness, for a few days," replied Andros.</p>
               <p>Then, resuming his seat, he drew out a heavy purse of gold, and laid it on the
                  table.</p>
               <p>"Keep this for your own use, my good friends," said he. "When Doctor Watson comes,
                  tell him I have been here, and have gone away, perhaps forever. Tell him to keep
                  my secret and do his duty by my child, and God will bless him."</p>
               <p>"We don't want no more money, captain," said the old man. "You've made us too rich
                  already; and I'm afraid we'll be getting too proud for true Christians, if we have
                  so much. Money and goodness don't seem to go hand in hand together. Rich folks
                  always seem to try to ride down the poor.</p>
               <p>And the old man sighed over the truths which he had just uttered.</p>
               <p>"All the wealth of the world cannot chase the goodness out of such hearts as
                  yours, my good friends. Keep the gold—take good care of my sweet babe."</p>
               <p>Andros said no more; but taking his hat and cloak, put on the one, wrapped himself
                  in the other, and kissing his sleeping child once more, departed.</p>
               <p>"That man isn't a professor, but he has a heart and a soul for all that," said
                  Jonathan, when he returned, after closing the front-door. "There were tears in his
                  eyes when he went out; and a man that can shed a tear isn't without heart, no way.
                  I'm sorry he isn't happy!"</p>
               <p>"So be I," said Betsy. "Let's kneel down and say a prayer for him, Jonathan."</p>
               <p>"That I will, my Betsy. That I will."</p>
               <p>And those two true Christians knelt and prayed—prayed as those, and those only
                  pray, who <emph>believe</emph> that God hears and will respond to their
                  petitions.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLV.</head>
               <p>Richard Mildollar had been dead one year—yes, rather more than a year. The dust of
                  summer, the sleet and slush of autumn had passed away, and dreary winter hung its
                  shivering pall over the city. But what cared those who, in dashing carriages, drew
                  up before the brilliantly-lighted residence of the wealthy widow Mildollar—what
                  cared they for the keen blast that howled along the streets, or the driving snow
                  which found its way into many a dreary room, where food and fuel were not; disease
                  and poverty, wretchedness and misery were. They knew not that their
                  carriage-wheels had brushed by the staggering form of one too proud to beg, but
                  not too weak to die—had they known it, they would not have cared.</p>
               <p>It was a "reception night" with Mrs. M., who, having laid aside her full mourning,
                  worn only because custom had demanded it, had once more opened her doors and
                  devoted herself to the world of fashion.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mildollar, to show how well she looked out of mourning, had donned the most
                  elegant dress which she could procure in the city, and she literally sparkled with
                  brilliants. Thanks to the discovery of a young and rising hairdresser, she had
                  succeeded in having all of the silvery hairs in her head changed to a darker hue;
                  and with the aid of another benefactor of fading beauty, her complexion was as
                  fresh as that of a maid in her teens. She was dressed so superbly, and
                     <emph>artificialed</emph> so completely, that she was almost the belle of her
                  own party. In truth, she almost blushed through her cheek-coat of "liquid rouge,"
                  as she heard the words—"charming," "beautiful," etc., etc., whispered from lip to
                  lip among the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Her air was stately and grand as she passed through her magnificently-furnished
                  rooms, greeting her guests and responding to their compliments. She leaned upon
                  the arm of her son, whose beard having grown, and manners become a little more
                  gentlemanly since his European trip, of which he now spoke so often, enabled him
                  to look somewhat like a man of the world—his tailor, barber, and jeweler having
                  each done their best to finish his appearance.</p>
               <p>The two had nearly finished the circuit of the crowded rooms, when a tall,
                  elegantly-dressed, and dashing-looking female entered, leaning on the arm of a
                  gentleman who was remarkable from the profusion of his whiskers and the abundance
                  of his flashy jewelry.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mildollar trembled, and almost turned pale in spite of her rouge.</p>
               <p>"How dare <emph>she</emph> come here?" she asked of her son, as she pointed to the
                  woman—who was none other than our old friend Phone.</p>
               <p>"<emph>She</emph> dare do anything!" said Harry Corryell, in a whisper." "But that
                  fellow with her takes <emph>my</emph> eye! By thunder, it is Barrington! I know
                  him, in spite of his whiskers!"</p>
               <p>"They must not stay here. Do get them away, or I shall faint!" said Mrs.
                  Mildollar.</p>
               <p>"I'll try, mother; but if she won't go, she won't! I know <emph>her</emph>, now!—I
                  wish I never had."</p>
               <p>"Order them out of the house!" said Mrs. Mildollar.</p>
               <p>"That would never do. They have our secret; and you know she says the will is not
                  destroyed. In fact, we have both seen it."</p>
               <p>"I don't care; the witnesses are dead, and I'll proclaim the document a forgery,
                  and <emph>law</emph> the matter out. Mr. Bitters, my lawyer, can drive them from
                  the country."</p>
               <p>I know there's a good deal of the bloodhound in him; but, for all that, he'd not
                  be a match for that English she-fiend. You've never seen her in a rage. I have,
                  and felt her, too; and I shall be careful how I raise the tiger in her again!"</p>
               <p>While this hurried and whispered conversation was being carried on, the two
                  persons whom it most concerned were approaching the spot where Mrs. Mildollar and
                  her son stood.</p>
               <p>The lady would have turned away, but her son whispered:</p>
               <p>"You must help me out, mother—you must help me out!" And she was forced to
                  stay.</p>
               <p>"Good evening, madam; you look charmingly this evening!" said Phone, with a
                  graceful inclination of her really fine head. "Permit me to introduce to your
                  notice my friend, Lord Ponsonby. My lord, will you attend madam while I accept the
                  attentions of Mr. Corryell?"</p>
               <p>So coolly was this said and done, and the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >ci-devant</foreign> Lord Ponsonby so quietly offered his arm, while "Miss
                  Coutts," as she was known to Mrs. Mildollar—who, however, knew<pb
                     n="64-65 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6962-00000033"/> her real character—took
                  possession of the arm of Harry, that the transfer was made before Mrs. Mildollar
                  knew what she was about.</p>
               <p>In a moment more, she found herself alone with Barrington, or Lord Ponsonby as we
                  must call him—for Phone had led <emph>her</emph> captive away.</p>
               <p>"Well, this is cool!" remarked Mrs. Mildollar.</p>
               <p>"Rather cool, houtside, ma'am; but decidedly pleasant in the 'ouse! 'Ow 'ave you
                  been, madam, since I 'ad the honor to see you bin London?" said Barrington.</p>
               <p>Mrs. M. could have fairly screamed for vexation, but she dared not make a
                  scene—for the ear and tongue of fashionable society are ever on the alert.</p>
               <p>"I don't recollect ever having met a Lord Ponsonby in London!" she said, at last,
                  with an air of cold dignity calculated to overwhelm the captain at once. But it
                  utterly failed, for the captain very composedly answered:</p>
               <p>"Not hunder the name I <emph>choose</emph> to be known by 'ere, madam. But you
                  know you met me there, and may thank your lucky stars you did, or you wouldn't be
                  here, now. You needn't put on <emph>hairs</emph> with me; for if you do, this
                  'ouse won't 'old you long!"</p>
               <p>"Do you dare to threaten me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I dare to <emph>threaten</emph> and to <emph>hact!</emph> If I say the word,
                  the will and the witnesses will be before a court in no time!"</p>
               <p>"It is false—the witnesses are dead!"</p>
               <p>"Not by no manner o' means!" said the captain, in the same low tone which both had
                  used so far. "Do you think I was so green as to slip my 'ead into a noose for a
                  few 'und-red pounds? Not I! The witnesses are hout of the way; but I can produce
                  'em at hany time I want to, at very short notice."</p>
               <p>"For Heaven's sake, discontinue this conversation, and come to me to-morrow, and
                  tell me how I can forever secure your silence and my safety!"</p>
               <p>"I will, hon condition that you hact toward me to-night as if I was a real
                  lord—introduce me to your friends as Lord Ponsonby, etc. Do that, and we'll drop
                  the hunpleasant subject till to-morrow!"</p>
               <p>It was a bitter pill for that proud, bad woman to swallow, but she could not avoid
                  it; and for the rest of the evening, Miss Coutts and Lord Ponsonby were
                  predominant stars of the soirée.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLVI.</head>
               <p>It was midnight—the same evening as that spoken of in the last chapter. Midnight,
                  and scarcely half of the people in the great city were asleep. It was but the
                  beginning of the day of pleasure to the wealthy in their revelry—it was but the
                  beginning of day for the outcast or the gambler.</p>
               <p>Alas! it was scarce the end of day for the poor, weak seamstress; for many a poor
                  toiler whose wages would scarcely buy them bread. Not the end of day for many a
                  one whose throbbing brain and sobbing heart were wearing away by the midnight
                  lamp, wearing away in coining out bright thoughts and gentle fancies to please the
                  multitude, who dream that a litterateur's life is laborless—or, <choice>
                     <sic>at at</sic>
                     <corr>at</corr>
                  </choice> best, a labor of love.</p>
               <p>It was midnight; and the rumbling of carts and drays which had thundered through
                  the streets all day was still. But, now and then, some carriage would dash
                  furiously along, carrying its occupants to the festive hall or the den of the
                  thieving gambler.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, amid the howling of the winter wind, arose the shrill clangor of
                  fire-bells, and warm-coated watchmen rushed along, springing their rattles, and
                  shouting "Fire!" as loudly as they could.</p>
               <p>Soon the rattle of rapid wheels, the hoarse orders of strong-voiced men, and the
                  rush of rapid feet, told that the noblest soldiers in the world, the brave and
                  devoted firemen, were aroused and rushing to their work.</p>
               <p>"Where's the fire?" asked a man, of a young fellow, who, despite the chilling
                  blast, was in his shirt sleeves, hurrying along with only his fire-hat in his
                  hand, to signify what he was.</p>
               <p>"In de Fift' Ward—can't you tell by the stroke o' the bell?" cried the gallant
                  fire-laddie, as he sped on toward the fire. A few moments and he was there,
                  working with "old 18" as hard as he could, before a mass of fire, for the
                  buildings were all ablaze when he got there.</p>
               <p>"There's folks live there—in that house—two old folks and a baby!" screamed a
                  woman, who had come out from a neighboring house in her night clothes.</p>
               <p>"Folks in <emph>that</emph> house, alive? If there <emph>were</emph>, they're as
                  dead as herrings afore this!" cried the foreman of "13"—as good a fireman as ever
                  run with the machine.</p>
               <p>"By de Lord Harry! I'm a goin' in to see, <emph>I am!</emph>" cried the coatless
                  young man whom we have just spoken of.</p>
               <p>And quicker than thought, he dashed in the already tottering door of the burning
                  building, and disappeared amid the smoke and flame.</p>
               <p>"Come back, Sam Latrobe—come back, the walls are tumbling in!" shouted the
                  foreman. "Work, boys, work! let the water fly—poor Sam stands but half a
                  chance!"</p>
               <p>With a quick and heavy crash, the men worked the brakes, almost hopeless for him
                  who had so daringly ventured his life within that terrible belt of fire.</p>
               <p>After a minute or more of breathless suspense, the noble fireman was seen to
                  stagger out, bearing a human form in his arms. He dropped it into the hands of
                  those who rushed forward to help him, and cried:</p>
               <p>"I reckon de old lady's dead; but I heard<figure>
                     <head>LIBERTY HALL.</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6962-00000034"/> a baby cry as I was coming out! I'll
                  have him, or spile!"</p>
               <p>Again, though warned that the walls were trembling, and likely to fall at every
                  instant, the heroic fellow rushed back, while the excited spectators could only
                  groan, and pray for his safety.</p>
               <p>He was gone longer this time; and, at last, the walls of the building tottered
                  more and more, and then, with a thundering crash, fell inward.</p>
               <p>"Poor Sam's gone!" cried the foreman of Thirteen.</p>
               <p>"No, he isn't!" he shouted a moment later, as the poor, young hero staggered out
                  from amid the smoke and blaze, blackened and burned, but holding a bundle clasped
                  to his breast.</p>
               <p>"Thirteens', take me and der baby home, will yer?" he gasped, as he staggered, and
                  fell forward among his noble fire-mates.</p>
               <p>With such a cheer as firemen know how to give, the words were received, and,
                  though poor Sam Latrobe fell senseless as he spoke, there were sturdy arms to
                  catch him ere he touched the earth, and plenty of strong men to fulfill his
                  request.</p>
               <p>"Poor old Aunty Birdsall, she's dead!" said the woman, who had at first given the
                  alarm that people lived in the burning house. "I reckon her husband is dead,
                  too!"</p>
               <p>And she wept over the form which the noble fireman had first dragged from the
                  flames; for Aunty Birdsall had no enemies, and many friends.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XLVII.</head>
               <p>Burned almost to a blister, his hair and eye-brows almost singed away. Sam
                  Latrobe, the noble fireman, lay on a bed in his widowed mother's humble dwelling,
                  in Laight street. And his kind mother was bending over him, when, with the aid of
                  the doctor, he was brought out of the first death-like swoon, into which he had
                  fallen after his superhuman exertions.</p>
               <p>And another woman—a girl-woman—was there, bending tearfully over him, repressing
                  the sobs which shook her lovely little figure—a beautiful, golden-haired,
                  blue-eyed, rosy-cheeked girl, of sixteen or seventeen summers, whose plain dress,
                  and that "poor fore-finger" all blackened with the prickings of the cruel needle,
                  betokened her to belong to the working-class—though many a belle of the
                  aristocracy might well have envied her the loveliness which made her almost
                  angelic.</p>
               <p>"Mother, dear mother!" murmured the young man, as he opened his eyes first on her
                  loved face. Then, as he saw that other tearful face, a smile of gladness stole
                  over his scorched features, and he said:</p>
               <p>"You here, too, Susy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sam; they said you was a'most killed; and I couldn't keep away!" said Susy.
                  And a blush stole over her face, like a glow of sunshine on a bed of roses.</p>
               <p>"Where's my baby?" asked the noble fireman. "Where's de little baby I saved from
                  de fire? Didn't de boys bring it along?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; it's asleep in my bed, poor little thing! I suppose it hasn't got any father
                  or mother—the folks were all burned up, I hear?" said Mrs. Latrobe.</p>
               <p>"Hasn't got any father or mother? Oh! ain't I glad!" said Sam.</p>
               <p>"Why, Sam?" said Susy.</p>
               <p>"Cause I'll be father, and mother, and everything to it!" said the poor
                  fellow.</p>
               <p>"Doesn't the burns hurt you dreadfully?" asked Susy.</p>
               <p>"Not half so bad as they would if you wasn't here, Susy!" said Sam.</p>
               <p>Whereupon a yet deeper blush overspread her features, and she put up her apron, to
                  wipe away something that shone brighter than a diamond on her cheek; for it was a
                  tear of joy!</p>
               <p>The doctor had pronounced him out of danger; and Sam, <emph>her</emph> Sam—her
                  openly-avowed lover—was glad that she was there!</p>
               <p>"I do wish you'd quit going to fires, now, Sam!" said his mother. "This is the
                  second time you've been brought home almost dead!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and de second time I've saved life, too, mother! I s'pose dey'll have my
                  name in de papers again, for this? I hope dey won't forget what company I belong
                  to!"</p>
               <p>"I wish you didn't belong to any company!" continued the widow.</p>
               <p>"Wish I didn't belong to no company? Wish I didn't run wid any machine? Why, I'd
                  be nobody, and worse, too, if I didn't! Mother, you don't mean that!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I did, Sam! The fire-bell never rings but it makes me tremble for your life!
                  If you should be killed, I should be childless!"</p>
               <p>"Why, no; you'd have Susy, there!"</p>
               <p>"Susy will not be my daughter till she is your wife; and she poor thing, frets as
                  much as I do, over the danger you incur!"</p>
               <p>"She doesn't say anything against de machine, mother!"</p>
               <p>"No; for she loves you so well, she hates to cross you even in a thought! But lay
                  still, and don't talk."</p>
               <p>"I will mother; but just let me see de baby!"</p>
               <p>The good widow smiled, and went and brought the little creature from her bed. It
                  had waked up, and was now as smiling and rosy a cherub as ever came wingless to
                  the earth: for it had been carefully wrapped up by the thoughtful fireman, and
                  borne through the flames unscathed.</p>
               <p>It extended its little hands toward Sam, and laughed a bird-like carol, as the
                  widow held it toward him.</p>
               <p>"Bless her dear little soul! What'll we call her, mother?"</p>
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6962-00000035"/>
               <p>"I'll call it Martha, after you, or Susy, if you like it better!"</p>
               <p>It has a name already marked on its little snow-white arm—a real, pretty name!"
                  said Susy.</p>
               <p>"What is it? Is it Susy; for that's the prettiest name in this world!"</p>
               <p>"No; it is ELFRIDA!" said Susy, with a blush, at Sam's compliment to her name.</p>
               <p>"Elfrida! Well, that'll pass; but I never knew a machine, or a race-boat, called
                  'The Elfrida!'"</p>
               <p>"I must go to my work, now!" said Susy. "I've got to finish two vests before
                  night. When I've got them done, I'll come and see you again, Sam!"</p>
               <p>"Do, Susy—do; I shan't need any doctor, if you only come once in a while!"</p>
               <p>"Isn't there somethin' nice I can bring you from the market, Sam?"</p>
               <p>"I reckon not, Susy. I don't feel like eatin' much, I can tell you; I'm as well
                  done as a cheap porter-house steak!"</p>
               <p>"Now, would some nice fried eels be nice, or some clam-soup, or a delicate pig's
                  foot, Sam?"</p>
               <p>"They're all very nice, Susy, when a feller feels like eatin'; but I don't. I'll
                  tell you what you may do, Susy, if you like!"</p>
               <p>"What, Sam?"</p>
               <p>"Why, you may get some candy and peanuts for de baby. I reckon it'll go
                  pea-nuts!"</p>
               <p>"'Tain't old enough for that; what do you know about feedin' a baby, Sam?" said
                  his mother.</p>
               <p>"Nothin' to what I expect to by-and-by; but I want the baby well fed, that's all,"
                  said the fireman.</p>
               <p>"It shall be. I've bought a quart of new milk for it, and it shall have as much as
                  it can drink!"</p>
               <p>"Well, you know best, mother! I hope there won't be no fire till I get well!"</p>
               <p>And the noble fellow, who had almost forgotten his agony while Susy was there,
                  groaned with pain when she went away.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLVIII.</head>
               <p>On the day succeeding the evening of her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soirée</foreign>,
                  Mrs. Mildollar sat, pale and anxious, in her private boudoir, with only her son
                  present. "It is two o'clock, and that is the hour the villain appointed for his
                  interview!" said she, looking at her diamond-encircled watch. "I wish he and that
                  brazen-faced girl would drop dead in their tracks before they could reach here!
                  Can't you get them put out of the way, Harry? If you could, we would have no other
                  draw-back to our enjoyment. But while they live, we will be in perpetual danger,
                  and subject to annoyance whenever they choose to persecute us!"</p>
               <p>"They're both so sharp, it would be hard to trap them" said Harry as he shook his
                  head despondingly.</p>
               <p>"Lord Ponsonby and Miss Coutts are in the parlor, madam," said a liveried servant
                  at the door of the room.</p>
               <p>"I will go down to see them in a moment," said the lady.</p>
               <p>"Harry!" said she, as the servant retired, "I want you to see that no servant
                  hangs around to listen to our interview. I will make the best terms I can with the
                  wretch! Oh! if I were only a man, I'd murder him!"</p>
               <p>And she looked as if she would indeed, if she could, as she left her boudoir,
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en roule</foreign> for the parlor.</p>
               <p>"How are you to-day, madam? Really you look charming, in that lilac satin; for a
                  woman of your age, you really wear well!" said "Phone," as Mrs. Mildollar entered
                  the room.</p>
               <p>"I do not want compliments from you, miss; if we must have business together, let
                  it be done at once!"</p>
               <p>"That's the talk—let's 'ave the <emph>business</emph> hover first, and then hif
                  there's hany refreshments, or the like hof that, <emph>we</emph> won't hobject to
                  'em!" said Barrington, turning from before a mirror, in which he had been admiring
                  himself, and nodding to the widow.</p>
               <p>"Sit down, ma'am—sit down, and make yourself at 'ome!" he added, as Mrs. Mildollar
                  remained standing.</p>
               <p>"Where's my hopeful lover—where's Harry?" asked Phone, as she "spread" herself on
                  one of the satin-covered sofas in the elegantly-furnished room.</p>
               <p>"His presence is not necessary here! I attend to my own business!" said Mrs. M.,
                  sharply. Then, addressing Barrington, she asked abruptly: "How much will buy you
                  off from troubling me forever?"</p>
               <p>"Well, a trifle; henough to make me hand Phone 'ere comfortable. We've made hup
                  our minds to 'itch hup together as man and wife, and want to 'old our 'eads hup in

               <p>"I don't want to know your plans, sir!" said the widow, impatiently. "I only want
                  to know what will buy your silence forever?"</p>
               <p>"Heasy, my good woman, heasy!"</p>
               <p>"I'm not a good woman, sir! I'm a lady!"</p>
               <p>"Well, ma'am, I beg pardon for callin' you hout of your name. "I suppose you're
                  worth a couple of million dollars, or thereabouts?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! not the half of that!" cried the lady, in alarm; for she feared that his
                  demand would be fearfully exorbitant, if he really knew how large the fortune was
                  which she had come in possession of.</p>
               <p>"You can't blind my heyes, ma'am!" said Barrington. "I've seen the hassessors
                  books, and know just 'ow much you're taxed for! Hand I've seen the little gal
                  what's mentioned in the will!" he added; though he spoke falsely when he said
                  so.</p>
               <p>"Where—where is she?" asked Mrs. M., eagerly; for a new and a horrible thought
                  flashed across her wicked mind.</p>
               <p>"That's more than you'll know, withhout payin' hup my demands first, and a little
                  hextra for the news!" said Barrington, coolly. "I suppose you'd like to see the
                  little hinnocent—like to hinquire habout its 'ealth!"</p>
               <p>"No; I care nothing for the brat!" said Mrs. M., angrily. "Answer my first
                  question: what sum will buy you off?"</p>
               <p>"Well, we'll be reasonable; eh, Phone, hold gal?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, Cap! I should think we could get along decently with five or six hundred
                  thousand dollars!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; 'alf a million down, and a note for a 'undred thousand more in a couple o'
                  years! I reckon that would do to live on hamongst the haristocracy!"</p>
               <p>"What!" almost screamed Mrs. Mildollar, "Do you mean to beggar me?"</p>
               <p>"No; we could do hit worry heasy though, if we liked!" said the captain,
                  quietly.</p>
               <p>"I cannot raise the sum!" said Mrs. M.</p>
               <p>"Not with more than that in the banks, and 'alf a dozen ships and store-'ouses
                  that you can sell hany day? You can't gammon me, hold lady!"</p>
               <p>"I will give you a hundred thousand dollars!" said the widow, in a pleading tone.
                  "A hundred thousand dollars is an immense sum!"</p>
               <p>"To some folks 'twould be; but we Hinglish don't count it much. We've named our
                  price, and hif you don't like it, why say so, and, maybe, you'll 'ave a chance to
                  think 'alf a 'undred thousand would 'ave been worth saving! I reckon you won't be
                  givin' hany more <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soirées</foreign>, and Master 'Arry will
                  'ave to come down a peg, and learn 'ow to hearn 'is livin'!"</p>
               <p>"Mother, give 'em what they ask, and be done with 'em!" said Harry, who had been
                  listening at the door, and had no desire to learn how to earn a living.</p>
               <p>"Come in, Harry, love; come in, and sit down here!" said Phone. "You needn't be
                  afraid of me now; the cap' and me are going to get married as soon as your old
                  woman shells out the needful!"</p>
               <p>"You shameless hussy! I'd have you know that I'm <emph>not</emph> an old woman! If
                  you don't leave the house, I'll have you put out!" cried Mrs. Mildollar.</p>
               <p>"You will, you—"</p>
               <p>"Stop there, Phone—stop! No quarrelin' till this business is hover, one way or
                  hother!" cried Barrington, interfering, to prevent a threatened collision; for
                  "Phone" was in truth a tigress, if once her temper was aroused.</p>
               <p>"Now, ma'am, speak hout!" he continued to Mrs. M.; "heither say you will, or you
                  won't; for we're not goin' to wait 'ere hall day. Hif you say you will, we'll give
                  you a week's time to raise the blunt; hif you say you won't, the will goes to the
                  Register's office, and the Surrogate gets the news hof hit, hand Doctor Watsons'
                  lawyer halso; hand the doctor 'll soon be 'ome to see to the haffair!"</p>
               <p>"Come again in a week!" said Mrs. Mildollar, faintly.</p>
               <p>"Not withhout you say you'll 'ave the 'alf million ready! Hour time is too
                  waluable to be fooled with!"</p>
               <p>"It shall be ready! But bring the original will with you this time; for our
                  settlement now must be final!" said Mrs. M.</p>
               <p>"That shall be hall right, ma'am. And now that business is hover, if you 'ave hany
                  little refreshment to hoffer, we 'aven't the slightest hobjection to it!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. M. turned almost white, in spite of her rouge, she was so angry; but she rang
                  for a servant, and ordered him to bring in some cake and wine.</p>
               <p>"I'd rather 'ave brandy!" said Barrington. "We Hinglish can't go such weak trash
                  as you Hamericans do!"</p>
               <p>Brandy was also ordered, though evidently with disgust.</p>
               <p>When the refreshments were brought, the captain filled his glass, and said:</p>
               <p>"'Ere's your 'ealth, ma'am, and hanother 'usband!"</p>
               <p>"One suited to your age!" added Phone, spitefully, as she filled and drank off a
                  glass of undiluted brandy.</p>
               <p>Mrs. M. was almost choked with rage; but she made no reply, nor did she speak
                  until they were gone.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLIX.</head>
               <p>Had they been willing passengers, upon a voyage of pleasure, Watson and Tyrconnel
                  would have enjoyed themselves on board the Jonah, on her passage south. Her master
                  was at heart really a good fellow; and though upon several points he was
                  obstinately firm, on all others he was as kind and liberal as a brother could have
                  been, <emph>pointedly</emph> speaking, on the <emph>square</emph>.</p>
               <p>He would not permit them to have any conversation with his crew—would not permit
                  them to be on deck when any vessels were near, and positively refused to run into
                  any port until they had reached the island where he was bound by his contract to
                  land them. But his stores, which were various, of good quality, and not stinted in
                  quantity, were placed freely at their disposal—books, writing-materials, etc.,
                  were allowed them—and he was personally as attentive to their comfort as he could
                  be. He was ever ready to converse on all subjects but the one which "hadn't two
                  roads to it," and therefore couldn't be argued—permitted them to use his
                  instruments, and aided them in becoming<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6962-00000036"/>
                  acquainted with the science of navigation, which they studied, not only as a
                  pastime, but also with the hope that it might be of eventual service to them.</p>
               <p>But for all this, the time passed wearily to them, and it was almost with joy that
                  they heard the cry of "land ho!" from aloft, which announced that the island of
                  their destination had been sighted at last. And as the captain handed the doctor
                  his telescope, after he had assured himself that the land "made" was the island
                  which he had discovered and named, he expressed his sorrow that they should so
                  soon have to part company.</p>
               <p>"The sorrow isn't all on one side, as Phelim O'Neil said to Bridget, his wife,
                  when she wished bad luck to the day that saw her wedded to him!" said Tyrconnel.
                  "But you'll not leave us without stores and weapons, will you, Cap'n Tubbs?"</p>
               <p>"You shall have everything that I can spare. I will pack up the things which I can
                  allow you, and see them put on shore myself."</p>
               <p>"Won't you let me help you, cap'n?"</p>
               <p>"Thank you—no! I can get along better by myself!"</p>
               <p>"Then sure you've nothing to thank me for. Don't forget to put a shovel in the
                  lot; for we may want to dig our graves, d'ye see?"</p>
               <p>"You shall have a shovel."</p>
               <p>"And an axe, cap'n, and a handsaw, and a plane, and a few pounds of nails, to make
                  our coffins with."</p>
               <p>"Or to build a boat! I must think about that request before I grant it!" said the
                  captain.</p>
               <p>"What is it to you, captain, what we do, after you have landed us, and fulfilled
                  your contract?" asked the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, sir, nothing—only, in my contract, it was made a special point that I
                  should not in <emph>any way</emph> aid you to leave until your friends sent for
                  you! To give you the means to build a boat would be to break a part of my
                  contract, and I must not do it!"</p>
               <p>"How do you like the looks of the land, doctor?" asked Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"I see nothing but huge cliffs, against which the great waves break in foam. It
                  has a hard look."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir—from the outside, like some men; but inside of those rugged cliffs,
                  there are as lovely valleys as ever the eye of man looked upon. You will say so
                  when you get there," said the captain.</p>
               <p>"I doubt it," said the doctor, sadly. "Paradise would lose its charms if one knew
                  that it was his <emph>prison!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The captain made no reply; but after giving some sailing directions to his mate,
                  went below to arrange the stores which he intended to leave with the unfortunate
                  men.</p>
               <p>Meantime, the doctor and Tyrconnel remained on deck; for both had written letters
                  directed homeward, containing directions, so far as they could give them, up to
                  the previous day, of their then latitude and longitude; and they hoped, by some
                  means, to be able to bribe one of the crew to conceal these letters, and to carry
                  or send them home.</p>
               <p>But the mate had his orders, and they could not find the sought-for opportunity.
                  The captain remained below for an hour or more, until the mate sent to inform him
                  that he had reached the bearings of a peak which indicated the entrance to the
                  only harbor on the island.</p>
               <p>The doomed passengers expected, of course, that the ship would be run in; but when
                  within a mile or thereabouts of the bold, rocky coast, against which the white
                  surf thundered incessantly, the captain ordered the ship hove to, and the
                  long-boat hoisted out, as well as a quarter-boat lowered.</p>
               <p>Into the long-boat, as soon as it floated alongside, a half-dozen large chests
                  were lowered, while the other boat was made ready for the passengers.</p>
               <p>The second mate took charge of the long-boat, and the captain stepped into the
                  quarter-boat, followed by Watson, Tyrconnel, and poor Jones, the steward of the
                  Merlin, an unhappy being who had filled various capacities before he became a
                  ship's steward in the Merlin—each occupation resulting alike disastrously to
                  him.</p>
               <p>As Jones was in his way quite a character, it seems as if we ought to describe
                  him. His sallow complexion and cadaverous features indicated a natural tendency to
                  bile, and there was gall in his disposition as well as in his physical system. His
                  long, lank figure was bent as with the weight of grief, and his face expressed,
                  all the time, dissatisfaction with what he called his luck. Such a man, a regular
                  grumbler, was not calculated to make a pleasant companion for the doctor and his
                  friend; but, to give him his due, Jones was a worker, and could make himself
                  useful when he felt so inclined.</p>
               <p>Leading the way with the smaller boat, Captain Tubbs steered in through a narrow
                  cut or passage in the cliffs, and after a row of a mile, or a little more, the
                  boats entered a small bay, almost entirely land-locked, where, indeed, a scene of
                  beauty lay spread out before them. A valley, extending inland some ways, to the
                  foot of a lofty and rugged peak, was plentifully wooded with cocoanut and
                  bread-fruit trees—and a variety of other fruits also met the eye. A limpid stream
                  of fresh water ran gurgling along until it emptied into the sea. Flowers of every
                  hue grew plentifully about; and with the exception that there was no sign of man
                  there, the view was most inviting.</p>
               <p>The articles were landed from the long-boat, which immediately shoved off, and
                  returned to the ship; and then Captain Tubbs, for the first time exhibiting much
                  emotion, bade the unfortunate men good-bye.</p>
               <p>"I'm sorry to leave you here, gentlemen—very sorry!" said he; "but I had no
                  choice, the way I was situated, and had to make the contract I did. If you knew
                  all the circumstances, you'd acknowledge I did the best for you; for I believe if
                  I hadn't agreed to bring you here, your lives wouldn't have been worth a ha'penny
                  to the pound! And it shan's be my fault if you have to stay here very long.
                  Good-bye, gentlemen! I've put up everything I could think of to make you
                  comfortable; and I hope you won't think too hard of Bill Tubbs for this!"</p>
               <p>"You have been very kind to us while on board your own ship, Captain Tubbs," said
                  Tyrconnel. "We'll do you the justice to say that."</p>
               <p>"And we hope that you will in truth try to make our stay here a short one!" added
                  Watson.</p>
               <p>"I hope victuals won't taste good to you till you take us home again!" muttered
                  Jones, looking yellowish-black, like the sunside edge of a thunder-cloud.</p>
               <p>"Good-bye, gentlemen!—good-bye!" said Captain Tubbs.</p>
               <p>And the next moment, his boat was darting through the water toward his vessel.</p>
               <p>The doctor and his companions looked at the receding boats until they reached the
                  ship, and at her until she filled away and ran out of sight beyond the cliffy
                  point which bounded the outer edge of their harbor. And all of this time they
                  passed without uttering a word; for their hearts were full. It seemed as if the
                  last tie to civilized life was being severed forever.</p>
               <p>Tyrconnel was the first to break silence.</p>
               <p>"Well, if there wern't three of us here, we'd be all alone!" said he. "What do you
                  say, doctor, to a tour of observation over our territory?"</p>
               <p>"I think we had first better prepare some kind of a shelter for ourselves, and to
                  protect our stores; for if I am any kind of judge of the weather, there's a storm
                  close at hand!" replied Watson.</p>
               <p>"I hope there is," growled Jones. "I hope there is; and that it 'll scatter the
                  wreck of the Jonah on this island!"</p>
               <p>"Avast there, you heathen! Is it because we are in bad luck that you wish the same
                  to everybody else!" cried Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon, my lord," said the steward, meekly. "But I haven't your
                  lordship's happy disposition, and can't take things easy."</p>
               <p>"Always take 'em as they come, and smooth 'em a bit if you can," replied
                  Tyrconnel. "But the doctor in night; there's a storm brewing, and we must knock up
                  some kind of a shelter. If there's an axe among the stores, we can soon cut down
                  trees for posts and rafters, and the broad leaves of the cocoa-nuts will thatch a
                  house a heap better than straw. Rouse yourself, Jones, and we'll have a government
                  palace erected here by the side of the brook, in an hour."</p>
               <p>An axe was soon found; for the captain had filled one chest with arms, ammunition,
                  and tools, and in a few minutes the three were as busily at work as a gang of
                  North-wood's sportsmen, pitching camp.</p>

               <p>Astonishingly ingenious are men when necessity forces them to an exertion of their
                  unknown powers. Having been in some "tight places," the author of this story has
                  more than once had occasion to see a verification of that fact.</p>
               <p>Not more than two or three hours were occupied by our "islanders," before they had
                  erected a firm and substantial cottage, the shape being something between that of
                  an Irish cabin and an Indian wigwam—a modification and union of the architectural
                  taste of the doctor and Tyrconnel; for Jones, being but a hewer of wood and a
                  bearer of burdens on this occasion, had nothing to do with its shape but to growl
                  at it.</p>
               <p>It was quite large; and roofed and walled so nicely with the palm-like cocoa-nut
                  leaves, that they had no fear whatever that the drenching rain of the gathering
                  storm would reach them or their goods, which they now removed within their
                  house.</p>
               <p>"Let's christen the tenement, now that it's built, doctor," said Tyrconnel,
                  opening a chest and producing a bottle of "old Holland."</p>
               <p>"What will you call it?" asked the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Castle Sorrowful, if I had my way!" muttered Jones.</p>
               <p>"But you haven't your way, you long-faced baboon. Don't be afther throwing cowld
                  water on every thing sunny you see, or we'll <emph>banish</emph> you."</p>
               <p>"Where to, my lord?" asked the steward, so innocently, that both the doctor and
                  Tyrconnel could not refrain from laughing.</p>
               <p>"Where ould Nick couldn't find you, if he wanted a fresh mourner for funerals,"
                  said Tyrconnel. "But I say, doctor, let's have a name."</p>
               <p>"Name it yourself, friend Tyrconnel," said the doctor.</p>
               <p>"I'm bothered to think of a suitable cog-<emph>no</emph>men," replied the
                  peer.</p>
               <p>"Call it Emerald Hall, after your own place in Ireland. It is green enough to
                  merit the name."</p>
               <p>"That would be mockin' my own memory I can't ache my heart by calling it that
                  Haven't you some sort of a name for it, now! Let us call it after the ould 'city'
                  in New York."</p>
               <pb n="72-73 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6962-00000037"/>
               <p>"I've the same objection to that which you just gave in reference to your own
                  happy home."</p>
               <p>"Then let's call it Liberty Hall."</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"Because the name will be indicative of our hopes of liberation, before we grow
                  much grayer than badgers."</p>
               <p>"Liberty Hall be it, then," said the doctor, with a sank.</p>
               <p>And it was duly christened in that name.</p>
               <p>And while they raised the christening cup to their lips, a heavy peal of thunder
                  rolled along through the sky, almost shaking the earth.</p>
               <p>"I mane no <unclear>irreverence</unclear> to the powers above, but by my faith
                  that sounds mightily like a salute," said Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"I hope the lightning won't strike us!" moaned Jones. "They say 'tis terrible in
                  Southern latitudes."</p>
               <p>"What aisier death could a man desire? and it's gentale, besides—the next thing in
                  dacency to having a bullet for a passport to the other world," said Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"Just as if any death was decent," muttered Jones.</p>
               <p>"What an ignoramus you are, sure!" cried the peer. "A man that's never lived
                  dacently in his life, may die dacently after all. But you'd grumble if you didn't
                  have to die at all. but were to be translated like Elijah of ould! You take all
                  patience out of me—you grumble like the tooth-ache!"</p>
               <p>"You'd grumble too, my lord, if you had a wife and seven little ones at home, and
                  never expected to see them again."</p>
               <p>"That would depend upon circumstances," replied Tyrconnel. "If the wife was
                     <emph>stormy</emph>, and the little ones <emph>squally</emph>, I might thank
                  the luck and the bright waters that divided us!"</p>
               <p>The steward said no more; and while the storm, which had now opened, raged and
                  poured, the doctor proposed an investigation of their stores.</p>
               <p>The captain had indeed provided for them, with a liberality and judgment beyond
                  their hopes. Stores of every kind that he had on board, cooking utensils,
                  clothing, books and arms, were all there.</p>
               <p>One small bag was marked for Tyrconnel. He opened it, and found it contained
                  potatoes, which had become so scarce on board the ship, that they no longer
                  appeared on the table.</p>
               <p>"By me sowl! the captain has a tinder and a thoughtful heart. Here's the swatest
                  fruit that ever grew on Erin's sod; and he, knowin' my likin' for it, has saved
                  this bag of seed for me. Sure, it's ten sins the less he'll have to suffer for,
                  when he gets to purgatory."</p>
               <p>"He'll never stop there, when he dies—he'll go down, down to the bottomless pit!"
                  said Jones, solemnly.</p>
               <p>We regret to leave our friends at this interesting juncture, but duty calls us
                  elsewhere; and as they are as comfortable as could be expected under the
                  circumstances, we will make no further apology for departure at present.</p>

               <p>Though Sam Latrobe, the heroic fireman, had been severely injured in rescuing
                  little Elfrida from the flames, he rapidly recovered; for he had three advantages
                  not possessed by every victim of untoward accidents. He had youth, a strong
                  constitution not impaired by dissipation, and tender nursing by those who loved
                  him dearly.</p>
               <p>Only a few weeks elapsed, before he was able to be around at "Thirteen's house"
                  again, where he was received by his brother firemen, with every demonstration of
                  love and respect that their warm hearts could dictate.</p>
               <p>"The papers had de company in dis time, when they spoke about my savin' de baby
                  Didn't you see <emph>that</emph>, boys?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes!" said several.</p>
               <p>"I told the feller what come and axed my name, and said that he was a reporter,
                  dat if he didn't put in de company I belonged to, I'd lam him out of his boots as
                  soon as ever I got well. And I'd have <emph>done</emph> it, too, you may go your
                  lives I would!"</p>
               <p>"How is the baby, Sam?" asked one of the boys.</p>
               <p>"It's as fine as a sea-bass in deep water," said Sam. "Mother thought that it
                  wouldn't go pea-nuts, but it <emph>does</emph>. I'm sorry that it's a gal,
                  though."</p>
               <p>And Sam heaved a heavy sigh.</p>
               <p>"Why?" asked one of the company</p>
               <p>"Cause it can't grow up and run wid de machine!"</p>
               <p>And Sam sighed again. Then his face brightened, and though he blushed like a girl
                  as he spoke, he said:</p>
               <p>"Boys, I'm going to double up.'</p>
               <p>"What?" cried several.</p>
               <p>"Yes! Me and Susy are goin' to be married. You see, mother is gettin' old, and
                  it's a heap o' trouble to take care o' the baby, all by herself; and Susy and me
                  has been courting so long, we thought we might as well get slung now, as to put it
                  off till wrinkles come in our faces. My boss, when I told him of it, said he'd put
                  on five dollars a month more to my wages; so I guess I can get on first chop, and
                  no mistake."</p>
               <p>The boys all congratulated Sam heartily, and one of them proposed to exempt him
                  from fire-duty, though they kept him on their roll.</p>
               <p>"Look, there—none o' that, if you love me," cried Sam, very much excited. "If I
                  had to leave de comp'ny, I wouldn't get married. Jest as long as my legs last, and
                  I can hear de alarm, I shall run wid de old machine. Mind I say that, and it's
                  jest as good as sworn to!"</p>

               <p>The offending member withdrew his proposition, which delighted Sam so much that he
                  wouldn't take a refusal from any one of the party to go around to the "Widow's" to
                  take a "snifter" at his expense.</p>
               <p>The "Widow's" was a favorite house, where, in hot weather, they could find
                  lemonade with a stick in it; or in cold weather, the delectable(?) beverage known
                  as "Tom and Jerry" could be had. The rosy-faced lady who kept it had made herself
                  popular by naming her saloon the "Firemen's Retreat," and even holding herself
                  ready to open her doors at any hour of the night, when the weary firemen were
                  dragging the "machine" home from a fire. And though she didn't mingle in politics
                  like most of the saloon-keepers of the city, she would have been sure of the
                  firemen's vote if she had.</p>

               <p>Reader, are you good at sleeping? Are you descended directly or indirectly from
                  old Rip Van Winkle? If so, a nap of fourteen or fifteen years will be but a brief
                  one for you, and I ask you to take it. The liberty I take is no greater than that
                  which you often see in the theatrical world, where the dramatic baby of one act
                  becomes the tragic hero of another; so just consider that about fourteen or
                  fifteen years, "more or less," as the land titles have it, have passed away since
                  the occurrences of our last chapter.</p>
               <p>Write <emph>blank</emph> on your actual knowledge-book for all that has happened
                  during that time, and hope that with good fortune I shall be enabled eventually to
                  fill the blank to your satisfaction. With this divergent explanation, I am ready
                  to blow "up brakes," in railroad parlance, and to "go ahead."</p>
               <p>Two men, yet young, or approaching middle-age, but wearing the marks of
                     dissipation—<emph>gentlemen</emph>, I suppose I ought to call them, for they
                  were fashionably dressed, and appeared to think a great deal of themselves—were
                  walking up Bleecker street, toward that lovely triangular square known as
                  Abingdon, where the said Bleecker street ends on Hudson street, and that
                  Hollandic, or Bavarian, or Germanic avenue—the Ninth—commences.</p>
               <p>It was near the close of a December day, one of the coldest, rawest, and bleakest
                  of the month.</p>
               <p>The two well-clad, gloved, and cloaked individuals, seemed to be very comfortable,
                  however, for their faces, as well as their "walk and conversation," indicated that
                  they had recently come from some region where ardent spirits had been convenient,
                  and their ardor had not neglected the opportunity to make familiar acquaintance
                  therewith. Now we have gone a long ways around about to try and avoid saying
                  vulgarly that these two individuals, Harry Corryell and his friend Mr Joram Jalap,
                  son of the wealthy Mr. Adoniram Jalap, formerly "Jalap &amp; Co.," the great
                  importing druggists, were half-drunk; but it was a fact, and must appear on the
                  record.</p>
               <p>They were walking arm-in-arm, and were endeavoring to wheel on the right pivot
                  from the corner of Bleecker street, when a young girl, who was hurrying down the
                  street, keeping close under the lee of the houses to avoid the sleet which was
                  flying with the harsh easterly wind, ran against Mr. Corryell with such force that
                  he would have fallen, had he not caught hold of the iron railing in front of the
                  newly-erected brick house there. The effect of the collision was yet more severe
                  upon the poor girl, for it threw her back upon the pavement, and a small bundle
                  which she carried was pitched nearly into the gutter. Her hood, too, was thrown
                  back, revealing one of the loveliest faces that ever a good man loved to look
                  upon, and a bad and sensual one could call up blushes on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Corryell muttered a bitter oath, and would have said more, had he not observed
                  the bewildering beauty of the girl, and he staggered forward to help her up,
                  saying:</p>
               <p>"By Jove, I didn't mean to run against you, miss! Jalap, my boy, pick up the young
                  lady's parcel, will you? Thunder and Mars, it isn'nt every day a man runs against
                  so much beauty!"</p>
               <p>"Please give me my bundle, sir—I am in a hurry!" said the young girl, for she was
                  not more than fifteen or sixteen, though very womanly in figure and
                  expression.</p>
               <p>"Not till you tell me your name and where you live, my dear," said the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">roué</foreign>, who at once saw, by her dress and the bundle she
                  carried, that she belonged to the most cruelly-abused and worst-paid class of
                  toilers in the great city—the working-girls.</p>
               <p>"That is information which a stranger has no right to demand!" she said, with a
                  dignity which would have silenced a <emph>man</emph>. "Please give me my bundle—it
                  is work which I am carrying home."</p>
               <p>"Let me carry it for you—I have plenty of time. Jalap, you go on up to my room,
                  old boy; I'll be there as soon as this adventure is over."</p>
               <p>"You had better give me the bundle, sir!" said the girl, while her dark eyes
                  flashed the indignation which she felt.</p>
               <p>"I shall do no such thing, my little beauty. I'm going to see where you live."</p>
               <p>"It will do you no good to know," said the spirited girl.</p>
               <p>"That's more than you know, my dear—so lead the way," said Corryell, bold with
                  liquor, and reckless in his libertinish nature.</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir—I will go home, and if you choose to follow me, you may look out
                  for the consequences!"</p>
               <p>"I never fear consequences, my dear—I'm<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6962-00000039"/>
                  rich, and <emph>money</emph> needn't fear anything in this city!"</p>
               <p>The girl made no reply, but hurried on into Hudson street, down which she passed
                  until she reached Laight street, never once replying to the fulsome compliments
                  which Corryell from time to time paid her.</p>
               <p>She went but a little way down Laight street before she stopped at the door of a
                  small frame dwelling, which, by its looks, denoted that its occupants, at best,
                  were merely comfortably off in the world, and most likely had to toil hard for a
                  living.</p>
               <p>She knocked at the door, which, in a moment after, was opened by a man whose age
                  might be about the same as that of Corryell, but whose honest face and vigorous
                  frame told that, in all but age and wealth, he was a thousand times superior to
                  him.</p>
               <p>"What's the matter, Elfy? You look pale and frightened!" said this man, as the
                  young girl stepped in past him, while Corryell stood on the door-step with the
                  bundle in his hand, looking as if he wished that just then he wasn't there.</p>
               <p>"That fellow ran against me in the street and knocked me down, and then would come
                  home with me against my will, and has been insulting me all the way!" replied the
                  girl, bursting into tears.</p>
               <p>"He <emph>has</emph>, has he?" said the man. And by the time Corryell could speak,
                  he was grasped by the collar with a strength which was almost giant-like.</p>
               <p>"Do you think you're too handsome, that you want to get your mug spoiled?" asked
                  the man, as with the flat of his brawny hand he struck Corryell such a blow on the
                  side of his face, that the blood flew from his nostrils.</p>
               <p>"I didn't mean to insult her—quit, don't hit me!" bawled the coward.</p>
               <p>"Didn't mean to, eh? Well, I don't mean to lam you very hard this time."</p>
               <p>And the man gave him a cuff on the other side of his face, which nearly set his
                  head askew on his shoulders.</p>
               <p>"Murder—murder!" yelled Corryell.</p>
               <p>"Get out—I'm not handlin' you rough! Now go and follow some other gal home!" said
                  the man. And with a kick which a mule could not have outdone, he fairly lifted
                  Corryell across the sidewalk into the gutter.</p>
               <p>"What is your name? By Heavens I'll have satisfaction for this, if it costs me a
                  thousand dollars!" cried the baffled villain.</p>
               <p>"You'll get all the satisfaction you want for nothing, if you don't move your pegs
                  away from here all-fired soon!" cried the man. "My name is Sam Latrobe, and if you
                  want to know anything more about me, go over to Thirteen's house and ask the boys;
                  or go to my boss—he'll tell you that the man that feels with me or mine had better
                  have his life insured."</p>
               <p>"I'll remember you, my fine fellow—I'll remember you!" said Harry, as he hurried
                  off, completely sobered; but smeared over with blood, and looking as though he had
                  seen the Fourth of July, or been to a Celtic wake.</p>
               <p>"I guess you will," said Sam, with a laugh, as he picked up Elfrida's bundle and
                  went in to the house.</p>

               <p>It was an hour later. Joram Jalap was seated most comfortably in the private
                  apartment of his friend, Harry Corryell. A glowing coal-fire shone in the grate,
                  and a glass of hot toddy was on the table before him, and a Principe cigar was in
                  his mouth. Mr. Jalap could hear the cold wind blowing outside—could hear the
                  cutting sleet dash against the closed windows. But he didn't care for it. In truth
                  it seemed rather musical to him. Of course it did; for he had no ears in his heart
                  to hear the moan of the shivering, freezing, starving, dying victim of
                  poverty.</p>
               <p>"I reckon Harry must have prospered in his adventure!" he said, as he took a sip
                  of toddy. "He stays so long. He is death on the girls, he is! Good-looking men
                  like him and me, with lots of money to spend, generally are!"</p>
               <p>Harry Corryell at that moment entered the room, and the man who would have called
                  him good-looking, just then, would have been guilty of slander, to say the
                  least.</p>
               <p>His eyes were both encircled with a cloud; his nasal protuberance was extensively
                  enlarged—a <emph>battery enlargement</emph> in the fullest sense—his clothes were
                  smeared with blood and dirt, and he looked as if "up and dressed," to sing "The
                  Used-up Man," to a Bowery audience.</p>
               <p>"Why man; what's the matter? You look as if you'd been run over by a train of
                  cars; been trod on by an elephant, or been looking at a dog-fight! That girl
                  didn't turn out to be a man in petticoats, did she?"</p>
               <p>"No, curse her, no—but I got beaten and kicked like a dog, by a gang of rowdies,
                  who were her friends! I knocked six of them down, but they were too many for me!"
                  replied Coryell, as he hurriedly took some medicine from a black bottle, labeled
                     "<hi rend="i"/>Old Cogniac."</p>
               <p>"Did you find out where she lived!"</p>
               <p>"Yes! and by Moses I'll make <emph>her</emph> pay dearly for this beating. She
                  shall rue the day that she ever met Harry Corryell! I'll have my revenge upon her
                  before she's six months older!" said Corryell, bitterly, while he proceeded to
                  wash his battered face, and to change his clothing.</p>
               <p>"How do I look now, Jalap?" he asked, after nearly a half-hour's labor had been
                  expended in washing, combing, and dressing.</p>
               <p>"As if you'd been butting a stone-heap Harry!" replied his friend. "You'll have to
                  lay up for a week or two; it won't do to go on the street with such a face."</p>
               <p>"I don't care! I can nurse my revenge; and you'll come here every day to play
                  eucher and drink with me, won't you?"</p>
               <p>"Of course, Harry. <emph>I'm</emph> the last man to desert a friend in trouble.
                  But you turned me off rather short when you saw the girl, and took a fancy to her.
                  If you hadn't, and <emph>I'd</emph> been along, you wouldn't have come out so
                  rough, I'll bet the oysters!"</p>
               <p>"I don't know Jalap! It was a terrible <emph>hard crowd</emph> that I got into!
                  Pass the toddy and a cigar, old boy! I fell better now!"</p>
               <p>He lighted his cigar, and sipped his toddy, without speaking again of the
                     <emph>crowd</emph> which he had met and not conquered; but he descanted at
                  length on the beauty of the girl whom he had traced to her home, and heartlessly
                  spoke of his revengeful intentions.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LIV.</head>
               <p>Writers, generally speaking, are very fond of describing the splendors of what
                  Willis calls upper-tendom, and by way of contrast, almost sickens one with a
                  description of some of the scenes of squalid misery, too frequently to be found in
                  the city. But all too seldom do they give us pictures of the homes of the workers,
                  whose toil enables them to live with some comfort, if not with luxury.</p>
               <p>I propose to picture the home of Sam Latrobe, as it was when he had kicked Harry
                  Corryell into the gutter, and followed Elfrida into the house. In the warm and
                  comfortable room which served alike for a parlor, dining-room, sitting-room, and
                  kitchen, near the great, warm cooking-stove, sat his invalid mother, propped up
                  with pillows in her large "arm-chair," engaged in knitting some very small woolen
                  stockings for a juvenile Sam, of about four years old, who at that moment was
                  dragging a tin pail over the floor, by a string attatched to its bale, shouting
                  out his orders—"<emph>jump her, boys!</emph> Don't let old Thirteen be
                  passed!"</p>
               <p>"Do make this child stop his noise, Sam—he'll craze his poor grandmother!" said
                  our old friend Susy; who, if not quite so handsome as she was when we saw her
                  first, was much more womanly, and still looking very well—<emph>very</emph> well,
                  indeed!</p>
               <p>"What are you at? What's the racket, Sammy?" asked the Senior Latrobe, looking
                  more with pride than anger on the curly-headed chub of a boy.</p>
               <p>"Goin' to a fire, fazzer—goin' to a fire! <emph>I</emph> don't see what muzzer
                  wants to make a muss about!" replied the youngster. "Gran'muzzer don't care if I
                  do play fireman, do you gran'muzzer?"</p>
               <p>"No, Sammy—bless your little heart! Make all the noise you want to!" said the kind
                  old lady.</p>
               <p>"There, muzzer, do you hear dat? Three cheers and a tiger for gran'muzzer!"</p>
               <p>And away went the juvenile "Thirteen" to the fire again, with redoubled vigor.</p>
               <p>"I reckon that 'ere chap 'll be a little kind o' careful how he goes home with
                  gals after this, Elfy!" said Sam to the heroine of the adventure in the last
                  chapter, whom our readers have discovered, of course, to be the Elfrida of our
                  story, and the child of poor Adelia Mildollar.</p>
               <p>"I told him he'd be sorry if he didn't let me alone, and mind his own business!"
                  said the sweet girl; who, in her plain, but neatly-fitting dress, looked even more
                  charming than she did upon the street.</p>
               <p>"I don't wonder that fellers do like to look at you!" continued Sam, "for you're
                  as handsome as a picture! You're as handsome as Susy was when I saw her first! And
                  I don't think there's much difference atween you now, only she's twice as
                  old!"</p>
               <p>"Age doesn't bring wisdom to you, Sam!" said Susy.</p>
               <p>"Why, Susy?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know <emph>why</emph>, Sam, but it don't You're just as full of blarney
                  and nonsense now as you was when you first came to see me!"</p>
               <p>"That's a good one, Susy. If it hadn't been for that very blarney, I'd never have
                  got you, or you me."</p>
               <p>"O Sam, do stop that child—he's got that dirty leather strap, that he calls a
                  hose, into the water-pail."</p>
               <p>"What are you at there, Sam?" asked the father.</p>
               <p>"Got the suction on, fazzer—takin' water from number five—they're gallus boys,
                  them <emph>Fives</emph> are!"</p>
               <p>"He's in the old track—born a fireman and can't think of anything else!" said Sam.
                  "I can't find it in my heart to scold him, Susy."</p>
               <p>"Do keep him out of the water-pail, at any rate, Sam!"</p>
               <p>"I will, Susy—come here, Sammy, and let me tell you about de big fire down in Wall
                  street!"</p>
               <p>"Was dat de fire you saved de baby from, fazzer? I played dat over to-day!" said
                  little Sam.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said his mother; "he threw the kitten into the fire, and then burned his
                  hands in pulling it out to save it! That's what he calls playin' save the
                  baby."</p>
               <p>"Bless his eyes—didn't I say he was <emph>born</emph> a fireman? I'll go my life,
                  Susy, that he'll be the smartest hand in the comp'ny before he's twenty years
                  old!"</p>
               <p>"I'll go you halves on dat, fazzer! Hurray for old Thirteen!" shouted Sammy, as he
                  made a furtive attempt to catch the singed kitten, which, having a dread of fire,
                  and a remembrance of former treatment, sprung out of his reach.</p>
               <p>But we have dwelt long enough on this home picture, and must away on the wings of
                  fancy to another.</p>

               <p>It would seem singular to one who did not study the close analogies of the body
                  and the mind, and observe how one affected the other—or, rather, how the ailments
                  of the one exhibited its effects on the other—that a naturally-contented
                  disposition should bear the body up, and preserve youth in one person far more
                  than in another, in the precise situation of the first, but not so happily
                  constituted in a mental sense.</p>
               <p>For instance, though years had passed since Watson, Tyrconnell, and Jones had been
                  left on their lonely South Sea Island, the Irish peer did not seem to have lost a
                  year in looks; for his cheek, though tropic-bronzed in a slight degree, was as
                  fresh as ever; his eye as bright, his well-knit frame as lithe and vigorous, and
                  his sparkling wit as lively and redundant as it had been in the most joyous of
                  earlier days.</p>
               <p>The doctor was altered, though he had <unclear>borne</unclear> his fate with a
                  philosophical calmness <unclear>which</unclear> had mellowed the change very
                  much.</p>
               <p>But Jones—poor Jones!—in him the change was so great that his nearest friend,
                  neither his wife nor the cherished "seven little ones," ever would have known him.
                  Hogarth's curve of beauty was fully developed on his back; his hair and unshaven
                  beard were long and white, and draggled on the winds like bleached hay from the
                  crest of an old stack. His face was hollow; his features sharp; and his voice
                  expressly adapted to singing: <q>
                     <l>"Hark, from the tombs a doleful sound!"</l>
                  </q> without need of any accompaniment.</p>
               <p>One of the first things which they had done after having made a tour of
                  observation over their island to discover its resources, had been to erect a lofty
                  tower on the cliff, near their harbor, in which they reared a flag-staff, from
                  which, at all times, night and day, fair weather and foul, fluttered a white flag,
                  as a signal of distress; for they lived in the hope that some vessel, driven from
                  her course by stress of weather, might come in sight of their place of exile. Many
                  a night, also, after with weary toil they had carried up fuel there, a beacon
                  light blazed out in the darkness. But all seemed in vain; for years passed, and
                  they saw no sign of relief, no vestige of anything human beyond themselves, and
                  that which they had with them.</p>
               <p>Beyond this isolation (which in itself was a misery), they had lived comfortably.
                  For food, they had fruit of various kinds (Tyrconnell's "fruit of Erin" had also
                  produced well); they had any quantity and variety of fish; wild fowl were
                  plentiful; and a small species of wild hog ran thick through the groves—so thick,
                  indeed, that they had to fence in their garden-ground. The meat of this animal,
                  instead of being gross and cloying—like the Jews' abomination, called pork in
                  civilized lands—was very delicate, juicy, and nice.</p>
               <p>For clothing, they had not suffered—in truth, had they been as scantily provided
                  as were Monsieur Adam and his lady, in Eden, they would not have suffered. They
                  had been provided with a good deal by Captain Tubbs, and having before read and
                  heard of the native tapa, or cloth (made from bark, by the natives), had tried
                  their hands in its manufacture, and succeeded admirably.</p>
               <p>Each morning, one or all of them hurried to their look-out on the cliff, to see if
                  a sail was in sight; and so frequent had their visits been, that a regular
                  step-way was worn into the rude precipice, which now is, and long will be the
                  wonder of visiting seamen to that now famous island. But avast here! I am
                  anticipating my story—getting ahead of my tow-line.</p>
               <p>One morning, the sun rose clear for the first time in many days; for a fearful
                  storm had lately been raging, and they had been kept indoors almost altogether by
                  it.</p>
               <p>Tyrconnel, who was ever an early riser there—where no chance for dissipation made
                  the hour for retiring late—aroused Jones, and bade him go up to the look-out and
                  air himself, and see if he couldn't see a sail.</p>
               <p>"What's the use, my lord?" moaned the poor fellow. "You know I'll not see one;
                  we're doomed to die here!"</p>
               <p>And he uttered a groan as hollow as an echo in a tomb.</p>
               <p>"Oh! be off with your nonsense! Go up and taste the breeze that's comin' in as
                  fresh from the east as the breath of a Tipperary girl, coming from milking the
                  cows in the dewy morning, and then come back, and have a drop of my
                  'mountain-dew,' made from sugar-cane, with a tay-kettle for a still, and you'll
                  feel a year younger for it!"</p>
               <p>Jones groaned like a weary ox, and then, gathering up his long, slender legs,
                  started off up the cliff.</p>
               <p>"Come, doctor, dear! rouse up, and look a bright day in the face once more!" said
                  Tyrconnel, giving the doctor's bark hammock a shake. "I'm getting an appetite for
                  a drop of our home-made <emph>potheen</emph>. If ever I get back to the ould
                  country, I'm going to take out a patent for the discovery and manufacture of the
                  same. Won't it be a feature in my life: Terrence Tyrconnel, of the House of Peers,
                  manufacturer of sugar-cane whisky—late king of the Cannibal Islands besides!
                  Hallo! What the deuce is the matter with Jones? Has he trod on a hornet's nest?
                  He's dancing up and down as if he had two hot shovels fastened to his feet!"</p>
               <p>"A ship—a ship!" yelled, or rather screeched Jones, from his elevated post.</p>
               <p>The doctor bounded from his hammock as quickly as he would have done had he been
                  stung by a scorpion; while Tyrconnel ran as fast as he could up the path to the
                  tower.</p>
               <p>When he got there, he saw a ship, indeed, not more than two or three miles distant
                  in the offing; but she was in a pitiful condition—a dismantled hulk, with almost
                  every spar gone, drifting bodily in toward the boiling surf in the roll of the
                  sea, and impelled by the easterly wind.</p>
               <p>She was in fearful peril, even though the storm had passed; and her officers and
                  crew seemed to know it, for they were busy in trying to get some sail on her to
                  work off the coast with.</p>
               <p>The crew seemed to be very large—and the long, low, black, sharp-built hull looked
                  like that of a man-of-war. But if she was such, not a gun had been left on her
                  deck—they had probably been cast overboard, to ease her in the storm.</p>
               <p>"What is she?" asked the doctor—as, almost breathless with exertion, he reached
                  Tyrconnel's side.</p>
               <p>"She's a ship <emph>now</emph>, all but her upper works; but she'll be a
                     <emph>wreck</emph> in an hour, if something isn't done to get her into the
                  harbor, or to keep her off the rocks!" replied the latter.</p>
               <p>"Our canoe will live with two of us in her, in such a sea, I think. Let us go off,
                  Terrence, and try to pilot her in. It can be done easily, if they can get enough
                  sail on to allow of her being steered!" said the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Oh! for mercy's sake, don't you two go off and leave me here alone!" groaned
                  Jones. "You'll be drowned; the ship 'll be wrecked, and I'll be left here to die,
                  without a single one to bury me!"</p>
               <p>But the doctor and Tyrconnel were already half way down the cliff, on their way to
                  a small canoe which lay bottom up on the beach; and before he had made up his mind
                  whether or not to follow them, they had launched the little craft in the harbor,
                  and were swiftly paddling it out toward the open sea.</p>
               <p>With a groan, he again turned his eyes toward the vessel, and saw, by the actions
                  of the crew, that they had discovered the tower and signal.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER LVI.</head>
               <p>As the doctor and Tyrconnel slowly worked their canoe out against the head sea and
                  wind, they were seen by the crew of the endangered vessel; and loud cheers, from
                  men who had been almost despairing, now came down upon their ears; for from the
                  ship no sign of a harbor could be seen; nothing but the ragged, rocky cliffs,
                  where no boat could land, met the eye. And they could also see, as they neared the
                  ship, that her boats had been swept away, or else taken off by a part of her crew;
                  for none could be seen at her davits.</p>
               <p>It seemed a long time, but it was not more than a half-hour before they were
                  alongside of the vessel, on which the crew had just managed to set two old
                  try-sails, so as to give her steerage-way.</p>
               <p>Clambering up the side, they stood, for the first time in many years, among white
                  men; and a hard-looking set they were, to be called white.</p>
               <p>But had an angel appeared to Doctor Watson, he could not have been more astonished
                  than he was when one, who appeared to be the commander, sprung forward, and,
                  grasping him by the hand, cried:</p>
               <p>"Gracious heavens! what are you doing here, Doctor Watson? I supposed that you
                  were in New York!"</p>
               <p>"You have the advantage of me, sir; I do not know you!" said the doctor, as he
                  looked at the heavily-whiskered, elderly-looking man before him; for time, and
                  sorrow, and dissipation had indeed changed one of our former acquaintances.</p>
               <p>"Forgotten Gerald Andros?" asked the other.</p>
               <p>"Why, it is Andros—how are ye, captain?" said Tyrconnel. "But we musn't bother
                  just now to ask or answer questions, or else we'll soon have the roar of the surf
                  thundering in our ears, and the hard rocks under our keel!"</p>
               <p>"Can we make a harbor?" asked Andros.</p>
               <p>"Sure, it's all ready made, cap'n!" said the peer.</p>
               <p>"Can we run into it, then?" asked the captain.</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you can steer your ship according to directions! You see the flag-staff
                  there, on the top of the tower?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>"Well, the harbor's mouth is about three jumps of a good horse to the south of
                  that! If you'll steer a little more" to the east than you're heading now, you'll
                  soon get where you can see the entrance for yourself, though it's little wider
                  than a decent farm-yard gateway, at first. But never a better harbor did a ship go
                  into than it is, when you're in; for you can run right up to the shore, and tie
                  your ship's nose to the trees!"</p>
               <p>"He speaks the truth—if the vessel will only keep headway enough for steering, we
                  can easily get her in!" said Watson.</p>
               <p>"She'll do that well enough with this breeze and what canvas we have on her!" said
                  Andros, giving the necessary orders to the helmsman.</p>
               <p>"You have had a terrible gale, to judge by the looks of your ship!" said
                  Watson.</p>
               <p>"We have indeed had a tempest, the hardest that I was ever out in. Our sails went
                  to ribbons—but we've another suit below, if we can rig up spars for them. But how
                  came you here, doctor, and what are you doing here?" asked Andros.</p>
               <p>"It is a long story, and one in which you are much concerned!" replied Watson.
                  "But I had best defer the relation until the vessel is safe in the harbor! When
                  were you last in New York?"</p>
               <p>"I have not been there for fourteen or fifteen<pb n="80-81 (Illustration) "
                     xml:id="VAC6962-00000041"/> teen years, only once since I saw you, and but a
                  few weeks after that time!"</p>
               <p>"Then that she-devil, Mrs. Mildollar, has probably been enjoying your child's
                  property ever since; for it was through her agency that I and my companions were
                  sent here soon after the arrival of the Merlin in England and here we might have
                  died; had not strange fate driven your vessel here!"</p>
               <p>"You may well call it strange fate, for I am more than a thousand miles out of my
                  course. I was bound up the coast of South America, when the gale came on!"</p>
               <p>"Keep your ship steady now, and be careful, for the entrance is as narrow as the
                  mouth of a miser's purse!" said Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>The directions were obeyed, and the ship gliding smoothly on before the wind, soon
                  ran in through the passage; and her worn-out crew could not refrain from uttering
                  a shout of joy, as she moved into the placid little basin which seemed to have
                  been providentially hollowed out on purpose to receive her.</p>
               <p>The scant sail was taken in, and her headway proved sufficient to run her in
                  alongside of the beach, when ropes were run out and fastened to trees, which
                  seemed as all-sufficient moorings.</p>
               <p>"You see we're in safe, don't ye, Jones? Why don't you look glad, you woe-stricken
                  divil?" cried Tyrconnel to the ghostly-looking steward. "You'll soon be on the way
                  home to see Mrs. Jones and the seven little ones—though it's likely they're all
                  but the <emph>little</emph> by this time!"</p>
               <p>"I expect they're all dead!" said Jones, sorrowfully. "If I should live to get
                  home, I expect to find my wife has married to some Smith, or Brown, or White, or
                  Green! I don't care if I never see home!"</p>
               <p>And the steward uttered an unusually doleful groan, and went into the cottage to
                  get out of sight of so many people.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER LVII.</head>
               <p>After Andros had heard from Watson all that the latter knew concerning his
                  abduction and exile on the lonely island, he at once agreed with him that no one
                  but Mrs. Mildollar and her wretch of a son could have been at the bottom of it,
                  for he, Tyrconnel, and the steward were the only witnesses to the will, except the
                  captain, and his life had been despaired of by the doctors; while, if he lived,
                  his reason was almost hopelessly dethroned.</p>
               <p>"And they now are probably reveling in the wealth which rightfully belongs to my
                  child!" said Andros, bitterly. "By the Hand that made me they shall rue their
                  villainy! I fear that the old people with whom Elfrida was left may have grown
                  poor, or died! Confident that you were there to act as her guardian, and be more
                  to her than her wretched father could be, I have avoided going to New York, and
                  have not even sought to hear from that place!"</p>
               <p>"But now you will hasten to go there, or at least to help <emph>me</emph> to get
                  there!"</p>
               <p>"Of course I will, doctor. As soon as we can fish up our spars, and bend sails,
                  take in some wood and water, and refit the ship as well as we can under the
                  circumstances, I shall steer for the nearest port, which I shall enter, disguising
                  the real character of my vessel—which I now can well do, for her guns and most of
                  her arms are overboard. Then I will give the ship and their share of treasure over
                  to the crew; and with my share—which is enough for Elfrida, you, myself, and a
                  half dozen more fortunes—I will go with you to New York, to see that justice is
                  done, perilous though it is—for well I know I can never make my home there!"</p>
               <p>"But you can at Emerald Hall, in ould Ireland, cap'n, and it is myself that will
                  give you the <foreign xml:lang="GAI">ceade mille faltagh</foreign> whenever you'll
                  go there with me, or with your own convanience!"</p>
               <p>"Dinner is ready, such as it is!" said Jones, in a doleful tone.</p>
               <p>"Such as it is? Haven't we fish for a first course?" asked Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my Lord!" replied Jones. "Fish, full of bones—got one in my throat the other
                  day, and came near choking to death!"</p>
               <p>"And haven't we ducks, and plovers, and roast pig, and hashed liver, and giblet
                  stew, and plantains, potatoes, bread-fruit, and berries?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my Lord, such as they are!"</p>
               <p>"Such as they <emph>are</emph>, ye ould rook! Why, they're fit for a board of
                  aldermen! And haven't we plenty of my sugar-cane whisky?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my Lord!"</p>
               <p>"Then stop your croaking, or I'll pray to Saint Peter to turn you into a
                  bull-frog, ye omadhaun!"</p>
               <p>"Come into dinner, captain!" said the doctor, laughing. "Our friend, Terrence, is
                  so lively himself, that he can't endure the solemnity of our ghostly steward!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Solemnity</emph> do you call it, doctor, dear? It's worse than a solemnity!
                  It's a regular calamity. A grunt or a groan every third word, and the looks of the
                  man would make a monkey turn serious and set him to thinking of his latter days.
                  I'm going to engage him to go to Ireland with me, to <emph>look</emph> swate crame
                  into buttermilk without the trouble of churning it!"</p>
               <p>And with this the peer led the way into the cottage, where an excellent dinner
                  smoked upon the table.</p>

               <p>It was more than a week before Mr. Harry Corryell was in a fit condition to be
                  seen upon the street, notwithstanding the care and skill of his doctor—for the
                  blows of Sam Latrobe<figure>
                     <head>THE LIBERTINE REPULSED.</head>

                  <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6962-00000042"/> had been heavy. But the villain did not
                  suffer half as much as he deserved—he did not suffer enough to deter his mind from
                  looking back at the beauty of poor Elfrida, and forward to the time when he should
                  possess her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Joram Jalap has been his constant visitor during this time; for he looked up
                  to Corryell as a kind of Mentor, as a leader—for Corryell had taken him by the
                  hand, and introduced him to his "set," when Joram became a gentleman in
                  consequence of the retirement from business of his wealthy father.</p>
               <p>Corryell could very well afford to patronize Joram, for the latter had a full
                  allowance of spending money—was ignorant of the world, and as pliable as an old
                  hat. He was ready to "play second fiddle" in any mischief which Harry had afoot,
                  would come when he was whistled for, and go when he was bidden to. Harry had
                  initiated him into the mysteries of "eucher" and "seven up"; introduced him to
                     <emph>faro</emph>; taught him how to drive a tandem; taken him to the dances of
                  La Belle Sauvage; caused him to acquire a taste for champagne, arrack punch, and
                  Delmonican suppers—in fact, had put him through a fast course of sprouts in
                  genteel life, and (as Joram inwardly thought, and outwardly acknowledged) had made
                  a man of him.</p>
               <p>A man! As if manhood in a great city could be, learned amid associations with
                  gamblers, courtesans, and other criminals. But many, ah! very many of the scions
                  of aristocracy in New York, prove their manhood in no other school.</p>
               <p>Of course, Mr. Joram Jalap was Harry's attendant the first time that he was able
                  to go out after his "accident"; and, attired as unexceptionably as their tailors
                  could make them appear, they sauntered down Broadway.</p>
               <p>In front of one of the drinking-saloons, Harry's eye fell upon a man of full
                  middle-age—for his superabundant whiskers were slightly tinged with gray—whose
                  dress indicated him to be one of the "fancy," though it was not in the best
                  condition.</p>
               <p>"Joram, I wish you'd walk on down as far as the 'Arbor' and wait there for me,"
                  said Harry, as he saw this person. "You can look over the papers and smoke a cigar
                  till I come."</p>
               <p>"To be sure!" said Joram; and he passed on, while Harry stopped and spoke to the
                  person alluded to.</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Captain Barrington?" said he.</p>
               <p>"I'm well henough," said the person addressed, in rather a morose tone. "I s'pose
                  I hought to congratulate you hon the recovery of your heye-sight."</p>
               <p>"Oh! you heard of my accident, did you?" asked Corryell, in a friendly manner.</p>
               <p>"I 'aven't 'eard of hany haccident that you were concerned in," said the
                  captain.</p>
               <p>"Well, I mean the fight I had with some rowdies!"</p>
               <p>"I never 'eard of that heither."</p>
               <p>"No? Why, what did you mean when you said I'd recovered my eye-sight?"</p>
               <p>"Why, I meant that you 'ad got so you could see me. You've passed me dozens of
                  times within the past two or three years within five feet of me, and couldn't
                  recognize me."</p>
               <p>"You must be mistaken, captain; but the truth is, that I <emph>am</emph> rather
                  near-sighted."</p>
               <p>"When you want to be."</p>
               <p>"Oh, pshaw! you're gruff to an old friend this morning. Let's step into
                  Florence's, and have a hot punch in memory of old times."</p>
               <p>"I'll go the 'ot punch—'twould be hagainst my principles to refuse that; but the
                  memory of hold times 'ad better be dropped. I shouldn't think you'd care to recall
                  it. For my part, I'd like to drown memory haltogether. It's a huncomfortable mate
                  to sleep with, and none too pleasant company when a chap is hawake!"</p>
               <p>"It don't trouble me none," said Harry; but his uneasy look gave the lie to his
                  words. "But come in; I want to talk to you—I've something on hand which you may be
                  inclined to help me in, if you're well paid for so doing!"</p>
               <p>"I don't know habout that," said the captain, as he followed Corryell into the
                  building. "I've done work for you and your hold woman, and got my pay, and cried
                  quits with you both. I don't care to risk my neck in the 'alter hagain!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, there's no hanging danger in the matter I have ahead!" said Harry, as he led
                  the way to a retired stall or box at the farther end of the saloon, where their
                  conversation would be likely to be uninterrupted, and to which he ordered a waiter
                  to bring a pitcher of punch, hot and strong.</p>
               <p>"The matter I have spoken of," said Harry, after the punch had been brought, and a
                  couple of glasses disposed of, "is rather trifling to a man of your nerve and
                  capability, but I am willing to pay well to have it done quietly, so that my name
                  won't come out, and I can get my game! I know you've run through the most of your
                  money, and a trifle of four or five hundred dollars won't fall amiss into your
                  pocket."</p>
               <p>"Per'aps not—me and Phone <emph>'ave</emph> lived fast for a few years back. But
                  what's hup—hex-plain your business!"</p>
               <p>"I want a young girl abducted from her home. She has pleased <emph>my</emph> fancy
                  more than I have suited hers, and I have got to get her by force!"</p>
               <p>"And you can't get a young girl haway from 'ome without 'elp! You're smart—smart
                  as a goose with clipped wings. What do you want with 'er?"</p>
               <p>"That's <emph>my</emph> business. All I want you to do is, to get her away from
                  where she lives, and<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6962-00000043"/> to leave her at a
                  certain house which I will direct you to, and you'll earn your money!"</p>
               <p>"'Ow much? Did you say five 'undred?"</p>
               <p>"I didn't—but I will! You shall have five hundred the moment the job is done."</p>
               <p>"I must 'ave 'alf in hadvance. Most likely I'll 'ave to spend money in the
                  work!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I will agree to that, provided you undertake your work soon."</p>
               <p>"I'll go right hat it."</p>
               <p>"Very well—here is the money," said the villain, as he counted out two hundred and
                  fifty dollars in bank-bills.</p>
               <p>"'Ow'll I know the girl, and where does she live?" asked Barrington, as he
                  carefully recounted the money, and then stowed it in a lank-looking
                  pocket-book.</p>
               <p>"She lives at No. — Laight street, in a little frame-house, painted lead-color.
                  You'll know her by her beauty, for she's the handsomest girl in New York. Hair and
                  eyes black as night, cheeks rosy, figure splendid, age about sixteen, I should
                  think."</p>
               <p>"Do you know 'er name?"</p>
               <p>"The man who lives there calls her 'Elfy;' his name is Sam Latrobe. What relation
                  she is to him, is more than I can tell. She is too handsome to be related to him.
                  Now you know as much of her as I do, and I hope you'll work up the business soon.
                  On that card you'll find the number of the house where I want her taken, and the
                  name of the woman who keeps it. Tell her 'Harry Belden' sent the girl there for
                  safe keeping, and then hurry up to me, and let me know as soon as the bird is
                  caged. The rest of the money will be ready for you on the spot."</p>
               <p>"Hall right!" said the captain, as he took another glass of liquor. "I'll 'ave her
                  fast hafore twenty-four hours are gone by."</p>
               <p>"I hope you will. By the way, where do you live, and what are you doing?"</p>
               <p>"Why, me and Phone have a drinking-crib in Canal street—it goes in 'er name,
                  though. We're doing a heavy business—'ave girls to tend bar and gull the young
                  bloods hout hof their money, when they come to drink such liquor as we 'ave, and
                  'ear music from a pianny and a Hirish professor that we 'ire to play hon hevenings
                  for 'is supper, lodging, breakfast, and what rum he can drink. We call it a
                  concert-saloon, for the bar-girls can sing some, and then there's four or five
                  hactors that was, that 'ave drank themselves hout of situations, who come in and
                  sing for their rum."</p>
               <p>"I must give you a call some night."</p>
               <p>"Do—Phone 'll be glad to see you! She hisn't quite so proud has she was when she
                  lived hon the havenue."</p>
               <p>The pitcher of punch having been finished, and the business agreement concluded,
                  the parties now separated—Harry to rejoin Joram at the Arbor, and the captain to
                  visit his "concert-saloon," and concert a plan with Phone to carry out the
                  infamous work which Corryell had bargained for.</p>

               <p>The "drinking-crib"—spoken of by Barrington, and kept in the name of his "<foreign
                     xml:lang="GAI">chereamie</foreign>," Phone—who called herself a widow to be
                  more attractive to the young clerks, students, "only sons," etc., etc., who
                  congregated there usually to spend their evenings in drinking poor liquor,
                  listening to the execrable music, and saying "sweet things" to the bar-girls—was
                  but a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">fac simile</foreign> of more than fifty of the
                  concert hells of the present day in New York. The only other patrons besides the
                  classes I have just spoken of are sharpers and thieves, who live by "gulling
                  flats"—in other words, deceiving the unwary, picking pockets, and using the
                  slung-shot and knife when chance throws a victim in their way.</p>
               <p>Phone, with her dashing beauty, free-and-easy way, and good selection of
                  attendants, was very popular, and took in a great deal of money for liquor; and,
                  of course, if any of the "fancy" made a "raise" among her patrons, he was obliged
                  to turn over a percentage.</p>
               <p>Phone was the only one up in the establishment when Barrington came in after his
                  interview with Corryell, for she never had custom visitors in the day-time; and as
                  she never closed before two or three in the morning, her bar-girls had to take
                  day-light for sleep, or get none at all.</p>
               <p>With the freedom to which he was entitled, the captain helped himself to a glass
                  of brandy from a black bottle set apart from the array of bright decanters, and
                  which contained a far superior article—a bottle kept expressly for the use of
                  himself and Phone.</p>
               <p>After he had done this, he said to Phone, whose form was enveloped in a dirty
                  wrapper, her hair in curl-papers, and her face rather haggard from the effects of
                  late hours and its lack of paint (for the morning ablution had swept away the
                  roses which had bloomed on her cheeks the night before):</p>
               <p>"Come and sit down hold gal, and 'ear some news!"</p>
               <p>Phone threw herself languidly into one or the arm-chairs near him.</p>
               <p>"Who d'ye think I've been 'aving a talk with?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"How can I tell?" she replied. "Was it some one from over the water?"</p>
               <p>"No—but it was some one that 'ad plenty of mopusses!"</p>
               <p>"Did you make a raise?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, a bit of one!" said the captain, as he exhibited his pocket-book.</p>
               <p>"Halves, cap.—halves!" said she, extending her hand.</p>
               <p>"Hin course, my love!" he replied, handing her the pocket-book. "'Elp
                  yourself."</p>
               <p>"Two hundred and fifty!" she said, after counting the money, and putting one half
                  back in the pocket-book, while she put the other in the vicinity of where women
                     <emph>say</emph> their hearts beat. "Where did you get it, cap.? Have you
                  roughed a greeny?"</p>
               <p>"No—I got it from a hold beau of yours."</p>
               <p>"An old beau of mine? Now I know you're gassing for I've no old beau on this side
                  of the big fish-pond!"</p>
               <p>"No? Forgotten 'Arry Corryell, 'ave you?"</p>
               <p>"What, <emph>that</emph> spooney? What did you get money from <emph>him</emph>
                  for, when we've cried quits on him and his old mother ever since we trimmed 'em
                  out and promised to let 'em alone!" said Phone, angrily.</p>
               <p>"'Old hon till you 'ear 'ow it come habout! He 'ad a little job that he wanted
                  done, hand hoffered me five 'undred—'alf in advance, to do it. So I hagreed to do
                  it, seein' has 'twas easy done!"</p>
               <p>"What was it? A murder or something of that sort?"</p>
               <p>"No—honly to get a girl haway from 'ome that he's got a fancy for, and to take her
                  where he can put his 'ands hon 'er!"</p>
               <p>"A virtuous girl?" asked Phone.</p>
               <p>"I 'spose so, for hif she wasn't, a chap with money wouldn't 'ave no trouble in
                  gettin' 'er!"</p>
               <p>"A virtuous girl!" said Phone, with a sigh, then, while an angry light flashed in
                  her eye, she exclaimed, bitterly—"curse virtuous girls—curse 'em all! I hate to
                  hear of one, for it reminds me of what <emph>I</emph> once was! If you'd said she
                  was not virtuous, I'd balk Harry Corryell in his game, for I hate and despise him.
                  But she is <emph>virtuous,</emph> and must fall! I wish I could drag every one of
                  them down to my own level—then none of them could hold their heads above me, and
                  say they pitied my degradation! Curse them and their pity! Go on cap., and do your
                  job—but let the girl be brought here!"</p>
               <p>"He wanted me to take 'er to the 'ouse that's down on this card."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! Bring her here—I'll keep her as safe as any one else, and the money will
                  be better for us than any one else!"</p>
               <p>"That's so, hif 'e'll be hagreed!"</p>
               <p>"Curse him! Bring the girl here, and I'll see that he's satisfied! Better yet;
                  I'll help you in the matter, and save you all trouble. Tell me where the girl
                  lives and all about her, and I'll bet a dozen of champagne to a bottle of trash,
                  that I have her here in less than twenty-four hours!"</p>
               <p>"Well, Phone, hif you'll do the job, and I know you <emph>can</emph>, it'll be
                  hall the heasier for me, hand I'm satisfied to 'ave 'er brought 'ere! Has you say,
                  he can't 'elp 'imself hafter hit's done!"</p>
               <p>"No—and if he don't like it at first, I reckon he'll come down if I threaten to
                  take the girl back again, and to tell her folks who it was that caused her
                  abduction!"</p>
               <p>"Phone, you're a great hold gal!" said the captain, admiringly, as he went to the
                  black bottle and poured out another glass of brandy.</p>
               <p>"Fill me a glass, cap., while you're up!" said the woman. "I feel as dull as an
                  oyster-knife this morning."</p>
               <p>"That's hall of keeping hopen so late, Phone!" said the captain. "You're a wearing
                  yourself hout."</p>
               <p>"No danger, cap.! I'm sound stuff, and will last a good while!" said the woman, as
                  she swallowed the liquor which he brought.</p>

               <p>Sam Latrobe was away at his work one day, but little more than a week after he had
                  so unceremoniously dismissed Harry Corryell with a battered frontispiece and
                  somewhat damaged in the counter, but Susy was at home, and young Sam was on parade
                  as "Colonel Postley," using his grandmother's cane for a charger, while sweet,
                  beautiful "Elfy" was busy with her nimble fingers over the embroidery of a vest—to
                  be worn by some fop, very likely, whose heart beat beneath it as strongly as the
                  tick of a worn-out escapement galvanized watch, lost to time, and useless for
                  eternity.</p>
               <p>Suddenly an unusual noise in the street, and a crash, startled all the inmates of
                  the little house; and Susy rushed to the door to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>"Oh my! Here is a splendid carriage all broken to smash right against the
                  curb-stone, the horses are rearing and plunging, and a lady, dressed ever so fine,
                  has fainted away!" she cried.</p>
               <p>"What's de muss, muzzer?" cried little Sam, as he went to the door.</p>
               <p>"May I bring my lady into your house, madam? she has fainted quite away!" said the
                  liveried footman, as he bore a lady from the broken carriage, while the coachman
                  tried to quiet his spirited horses.</p>
               <p>"Of course, sir!" said Susy. "Here Elfy, and fix up the lounge to lay the poor
                  lady on, and get mother's hartshorn bottle."</p>
               <p>Elfy hastened to assist, for she was a kindhearted girl.</p>
               <p>Both of the women looked with surprise on the magnificent dress of their
                  unexpected guest, who was a rather handsome lady, of middle age, evidently one of
                  the aristocracy, to judge from her own appearance, her equip-page, and the
                  attendants attached to it.</p>
               <p>In a few moments she showed signs of recovery; and when she opened her large, dark
                  eyes, and saw the beautiful face of "Elfy" bending over her, she started in real
                  surprise.</p>
               <p>"Where am I? Dead and among the angels?" she said, in a low tone, as if
                  dreaming.</p>
               <p>"Your carriage was broken; but you are not hurt, ma'am!" said Susy, withdrawing
                  the hartshorn from her nose.</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6962-00000044"/>
               <p>"If you'll remain quiet, madam, with this good woman a little while, I'll have the
                  coachman go after the other carriage!" said the footman.</p>
               <p>"Do!" said the lady. "I am sorry to put you to so much trouble," added she to
                  Susy. "I don't know how it occurred, but I believe some part of the harness broke
                  and made my coach-horse run away!"</p>
               <p>"You are not putting me to any trouble, ma'am," replied Susy. "It is a pleasure
                  for me to be able to help any one! Do, Elfy, go out and bring little Sammy in from
                  the street; that boy will surely be killed, one of these days, he is so
                  venturesome!"</p>
               <p>"Is that lovely girl your sister?" asked the lady, as Elfy went after the
                  child.</p>
               <p>"No, not my sister; but she's almost the same thing; I love her as if she was!"
                  said Susy.</p>
               <p>"Ah, me! I wish I had such a sister! She looks <emph>so</emph> good and kind!"
                  sighed the lady.</p>
               <p>"She is as kind a soul as ever lived!" said Susy.</p>
               <p>Elfy coming in at that moment with little Sammy, caused a change in the
                  conversation.</p>
               <p>"That bright-eyed little cherub is yours; I can see that by the likeness," said
                  the lady to Susy.</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am; but he looks more like his father than he does like me!" said the
                  proud young mother.</p>
               <p>"Come here, Sammy, and let me wipe your face," she added to the boy.</p>
               <p>"Jess as if I wasn't big enough to wash my own face, muzzer!" said Sammy, as he
                  went to the wash-basin in the closet, and proceeded to make a grand splashing
                     <unclear>thereat</unclear>.</p>
               <p>"How smart he is! Ah! what a treasure such a child must be!" said the lady; and
                  then she almost wept, while she made it known that, though wealthy and blessed
                  with a kind husband, she had no children, nor even a near relative to love and
                  care for.</p>
               <p>"Now, if I had only such a young lady as your sister for a companion, I should be
                  less lonesome," said she. "I do hope that this accident, which has given me the
                  happiness of meeting you, will be the cause of our forming an acquaintance which
                  will be mutually agreeable. You will come and visit me often, won't you?" said she
                  to Susy and Elfy, but with her looks most particularly addressing the better.</p>
               <p>"We are poor folks, ma'am, and not used to going into society above us," said
                  Susy.</p>
               <p>"Oh, do not speak in that way. I have no false pride about me. I shall ever
                  welcome you to my house as warmly, yes, more warmly than I would one of my most
                  wealthy acquaintances, for I can never forget your kindness to me. You will surely
                  come, will you not? I will send my carriage for you."</p>
               <p>"Mother is an invalid, and I cannot leave her and Sammy alone," said Susy. "But I
                  shall be glad to have Elfy go—she has more time than I."</p>
               <p>"I, too, will be most happy to see Miss Elfy," said the lady. "I will send my
                  carriage for you to-morrow—now, I'll take no refusal—it will make me happy if you
                  come, wretched if you do not."</p>
               <p>The footman arrived at this moment; and the lady, who gave her name as Mrs. Emma
                  Harcourt, prepared to go, but did not leave until she had extorted a promise from
                  Elfy to visit her the next day at her house in Bond street, she promising to send
                  her carriage for her.</p>
               <p>"Did you ever see such a fine lady?" asked Susy, after her <emph>accidental</emph>
                  visitor had gone.</p>
               <p>"She was dressed very elegantly, and spoke kindly," said Elfy.</p>
               <p>"She wasn't half so gallus, muzzer, as de lady me seen when fazzer took us to de
                  Bow'ry Theatre! She waved de 'Merican flag in one hand and a big knife in de
                  udder, and told de boys to <emph>go in;</emph> she wasn't afraid!" cried little
                  Sam, warming over his only theatrical remembrance. "I wish Elfy would do like
                  her—'twas so grand! I hurrah'd with all my might; didn't I muzzer?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, you made so much noise that I was ashamed of you."</p>
               <p>"Fazzer wasn't, for he gave me a whole handful o' pea-nuts, and laughed till he
                  cried!"</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER LXI.</head>
               <p>When Sam Latrobe came home, Susy gave him a long account of her elegant visitor,
                  and the accident which had caused the visit, and dilated at length upon the
                  invitation which she had received to visit Mrs. Harcourt, taking to herself a
                  great deal of credit for her refusal of it, and determination to stay at home.</p>
               <p>"I'm glad you did it, Susy," said Sam. "There's no good in poor folks like us
                  making ourselves common with the big-bugs. If you had said you'd go to her house,
                  you'd have had to do it. And you couldn't have gone without getting a new dress,
                  and fixing up a heap. Then when you got there and saw the splendid furniture, and
                  ate the nice things which she would set before you, you'd feel discontented with
                  our plain living, and maybe feel sorry that you were a mechanic's wife."</p>
               <p>"Oh, never, Sam, never!" said Susy, warmly. "I had rather be <emph>your</emph>
                  wife—poor as we are—than have a king for a husband, if he owned all the United
                  States, and Jersey besides!"</p>
               <p>"Bless you, Susy, you look as handsome as a picture when you talk so! Has Sammy
                  been a good boy to-day?"</p>
               <p>"No, fazzer!" replied the young hero for himself. "I has been awful bad! I broke
                  gran'muzzer's pipe!"</p>
               <p>"Was that all? Well, I'll get her another, and take the price out of your
                  Fourth-of-July money."</p>
               <p>"Fazzer, I'd razzer you'd whip me!" said Sammy, after a moment spent in apparent
                  thought.</p>
               <p>"Why, Sammy—why?" asked his father.</p>
               <p>"'Cause I want all my Fourf of July money, fazzer, for powder and fire crackers!
                  I'm bound to have a <emph>bust</emph> on de Fourf of July, or I'll spile!"</p>
               <p>Sam laughed, and promised his hopeful that the Fourth-of-July fund should not be
                  encroached upon.</p>
               <p>"I've been more bad, fazzer," said Sammy, encouraged by the good-humor in which
                  his father was—though, to tell the truth, Sam Latrobe was seldom out of humor.</p>
               <p>"Well, what else have you been doing?" asked the father.</p>
               <p>"I gave de cat some of gran'muzzer's snuff, and it most sneezed its head off! And
                  I took de ribbons from your trumpet to make my bridle when I played Colonel
                  Postley on his horse; but I put 'em back again!"</p>
               <p>Susy's announcement that supper was ready put a close to the youngster's
                  confession; for, with a labor-sharpened appetite, Sam sat down to his frugal, but
                  abundantly supplied table.</p>
               <p>The indolent wealthy, no matter how many luxuries are spread before them, lack the
                  one thing which seasons and enriches the plainest food—the one thing which the
                  poorest laborer possesses—an appetite, so heightened by his industry that he
                  enjoys his food as a blessing.</p>

               <p>"Well, my hold gal, 'ow 'ave you succeeded?" asked Capt. Barrington, as "Phone,"
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">née</foreign> Mrs. Emma Harcourt, having dismissed her
                  hired carriage and footman for the day, came sailing into the Canal-street crib,
                  under a full press of canvas—or, rather, crinoline, silks, flounces, laces,
                  feathers, etc., etc.</p>
               <p>"Admirably, cap.!" she replied. "I can act the lady as well now as I did when we
                  lived on the avenue!"</p>
               <p>"When will you 'ave the girl 'ere?" asked the captain.</p>
               <p>"To-morrow, as sure as gold is gold. She is coming to visit me when I sen' my
                  carriage for her!"</p>
               <p>"My heyes, but you're a manager, Phone! 'Ow did you come it hover 'er hand 'er
                  folks?"</p>
               <p>"Why, my horses got scrumptious, the driver couldn't hold 'em; and so the carriage
                  was run against the curb-stone in front of their house, and broken. I fainted away
                  of course."</p>
               <p>"Hof course! Won't you take a glass of brandy to bring you to?"</p>
               <p>"I don't care if I do, cap. But I fainted away, and the footman, who is smart as a
                  steel trap, and up to snuff, carried me into the house, where they did all they
                  could to bring me to, while the footman and coachman went after another
                  carriage!"</p>
               <p>"Yes—did they 'ave brandy to bring you to?"</p>
               <p>"No—cold water, and hartshorn strong enough to wake a corpse from the tomb with I
                  had to hold my breath, for one good sniff o it would have half-killed me!"</p>
               <p>"You did'nt stay long in your faint, I'll be bound, if they 'ad no brandy!"</p>
               <p>"You may bet all you're worth I didn't. I came to in a little while, and then the
                  way I soft-soaped them greenies was a caution to fools. I made 'em think I wasn't
                  a bit proud if I was the rich Mrs. Emma Harcourt of Bond street, and went to
                  making love to the whole family, from the granny down!"</p>
               <p>"What to the man hof the 'ouse?"</p>
               <p>"There wasn't any man of the house at home, Mr. Green-eyes. If there had been, I
                  reckon his pretty young wife would have been enough for him to love, Mr.
                  Jealousy!"</p>
               <p>"I hisn't jealous, Phone, but some'ow my 'eart rather rises tow'rds my throat when
                  I see fellers a makin' hup to you, has hif you wasn't my hown true love! Blast my
                  heyes hif I like the hidea of you bein' a widder!"</p>
               <p>"Nor I, cap., dear!" said Phone, as she drained her glass of liquor.</p>
               <p>"What I meant habout your bein' a widder, was you're passing hoff as one 'ere in
                  the crib, which gives hall the chaps that come hin a chance to make love to
                  you!"</p>
               <p>"Where's the harm, cap., so long as I <emph>only</emph> love you! I fool them out
                  of piles of presents. There's that dry-goods clerk from Broadway has given me six
                  silk dresses within three months; not to count the gloves, collars, stockings, and
                  all that. I've got two watches, a dozen rings for every finger, and it don't cost
                  hardly anything for liquor since that South-street clerk has got to coming here!
                  My being a widow is worth at least three or four thousand a year to us! Where's
                  the harm?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know as there is hany '<emph>arm</emph>, Phone, honly it is rather 'ard
                  for me to keep from choking some o' them young bloods sometimes. Has soon as we
                  get twenty thousand a'ead, you've promised to go back to the hold country with
                  me!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, cap., and I'll keep my promise!"</p>
               <p>"Hall right, Phone! 'Adn't I better go and tell 'Arry Corryell that his game will
                  be 'oused to-morrow?"</p>
               <p>"No, cap., wait till I have her all safe here, and I reckon we can bleed him for a
                  couple of hundred more!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LXIII.</head>
               <p>New arrivals at the City Hotel! We announce this, not that new arrivals at the old
                  City, while "Father Jennings" was at its head, were a rarity, but because we are
                  rather interested in <emph>the</emph> "new arrivals" alluded to.</p>
               <p>First came the baggage, consisting of several very strong-built and
                  enormously-heavy chests; which, from their salt-waterish look, came from seaward,
                  if they did not belong to men who followed an ocean life. The steward of the Rio
                  packet, and a very grave and serious man whom he called Jones—who was an attendant
                  of the "new arrivals"—came in charge of the baggage, and engaged three bedrooms
                  and a parlor for the owners of the baggage, causing their names to be registered
                  as Señor Blanco, of Peru; Doctor Black, of Valparaiso, and Mr. Terrence O'Reilly,
                  of Callao.</p>
               <p>In a short time after the baggage had been placed in their rooms, the gentlemen
                  arrived—a sun-browned and awfully moustached and whiskered set they were.</p>
               <p>Señor Blanco was a tall, splendidly-formed man, with black, flashing eyes, and a
                  look as fierce as that of an untamed Camanche.</p>
               <p>Doctor Black was not so tall; but his whiskers were fully as heavy as those of the
                  señor. But Mr. Terrence O'Reilly out-did either of the others in the whisker line,
                  and seemed to be full enough of fun and deviltry to make up for the gravity of the
                  rest of the party—not excluding their man Jones—who seemed to have been naturally
                  fitted to take the part of Grief in a tableaux.</p>
               <p>The first order he gave, after he reached his room, was for "a bowl of punch made
                  from auld Monongahela, with a scattering of New England rum in it."</p>
               <p>The waiter, not understanding the order at first, asked to have it repeated.</p>
               <p>"Get out, you blockhead," said Mr. O'Reilly, "and tell Father Jennings to make me
                  a bowl of just such punch as he used to make for my friend, Lord Tyrconnel, d'ye
                  hear that? Be off with you, or I'll shy a spittoon at your head!"</p>
               <p>"Be careful, for the sake of Heaven, Terrence, or you'll betray our true names
                  before our plans are carried out!" said Doctor Black.</p>
               <p>"Divil the bit, doctor, dear! But did you ever see such a stupid rascal as that
                  waiter was? I wonder if I can't raise a cigar? Jones—Jones, where are you?"</p>
               <p>"What's wanting, my lord?" said that solemn-looking individual, coming
                  forward.</p>
               <p>"Did'nt I tell you to drop the 'my lord,' and to call me Mr. O'Reilly, ye
                  blackguard?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord—Mr. O'Reilly, I mean; but I forgot!"</p>
               <p>"See that you remember not to forget after this. Go and get me a bunch of
                  cigars—Principes, d'ye mind? There's a quarter agle to pay for them with, and see
                  that you get the change, and put it in your own pocket!"</p>
               <p>Jones gave a solemn bow of assent, and went slowly away to fulfill his orders.</p>
               <p>The readers, of course, now understand who the new arrivals were, and why they
                  came under assumed names. If they do not comprehend the <emph>why</emph>, we will
                  inform them, and so come to an understanding all round. It was an idea of Doctor
                  Watson's, who, changed by long exposure in the South, and his heavy growth of
                  beard, wished to preserve his incognito until steps had been taken to bring Mrs.
                  Mildollar to justice, and to secure the fortune of Elfrida.</p>
               <p>"I wish it were already night," said Gerald Andros—who was the Senor Blanco of the
                  party. "It is better that we should wait till night before we go to seek out my
                  child; but I feel so impatient to clasp her to my arms, that I can scarcely
                  restrain myself."</p>
               <p>"Take a glass of punch, señor," said Mr. O'Reilly, that beverage having arrived.
                  "Take a glass of punch and grase the wheels of Time. They'll rowl all the asier
                  for it!"</p>
               <p>"No liquor for me, thank you—mental excitement is enough for me, at present!" said
                  Andros, quietly.</p>
               <p>"Mental excitement is all well enough, in its way; but when my spirit is in a fog,
                  there's nothing lightens its path like a drop o' punch!" said Mr. O'Reilly, as he
                  poured out a glass of the smoking liquid and tasted it.</p>
               <p>The moment he did so, however, he put his glass down with a look of intense
                  disgust.</p>
               <p>"Jones—<emph>Jones!</emph>" he cried.</p>
               <p>"What's wanting, sir?" asked Jones, with a profound sigh, as he came in.</p>
               <p>"Will you go down to the bar and ask them what they call this stuff they've sent
                  to me as <emph>punch?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>Jones was absent but a few moments, and returned with a message which angered Mr.
                  O'Reilly considerably, and astonished him more.</p>
               <p>"They say below, sir," said Jones, "that it <emph>is</emph> punch—such as they
                  often make for Lord Tyrconnel, from a recipe he gave them."</p>
               <p>"The curse of leprosy befoul the blackguards! Why, I never gave them a recipe for
                  making punch—it was original with ould Father Jennings himself—he often told me so
                  when I praised it. But this stuff is as sour as buttermilk, and as weak as an
                  epicurean's prayer when dinner is ready! Go and tell Father Jennings that he is
                  wanted up in room thirty-four, immediately."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Jones, departing on his errand.</p>
               <p>"You'll be sure to expose our real names, Terrence! For mercy's sake have a
                  care!"</p>
               <p>"Never fear, doctor, dear—never fear—I'll not do that! But I want to catechise
                  ould Father Jennings on the subject of punch."</p>
               <p>The bland and ever-gentlemanly proprietor of the hotel, at this moment made his
                  appearance.</p>
               <p>"Are you the proprietor of this hotel, sir?" asked Mr. O'Reilly.</p>
               <p>"I have that honor, sir!" said Mr. Jennings, with a bow.</p>
               <p>"Will you be so kind, sir, as to taste this punch?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, sir!" and Mr. Jennings did so.</p>
               <p>"Do you like it, sir?" asked Mr. O'Reilly.</p>
               <p>"I cannot say that I do; but it is made from a recipe given me by a wealthy
                  patron, Lord Tyrconnel."</p>
               <p>"Do you mane to say, Mr. Jennings, that Lord Tyrconnel ever gave you a recipe to
                  make such stuff as that, and then disgrace the name of <emph>punch</emph> by
                  calling it afther it?"</p>
               <p>"Lord Tyrconnel certainly gave us the recipe not three weeks ago," said Mr.
                  Jennings. seriously.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Jennings, do you often get drunk before dinner?" asked Mr. O'Reilly.</p>
               <p>"Neither before nor after, sir!" said Mr. Jennings, reddening up—for he began to
                  think that his guest meant to insult him.</p>
               <p>"And yet you say Lord Tyrconnel gave you this recipe three weeks ago. Do you know
                  where Lord Tyrconnel was at that time, sir?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure, sir. In this hotel, which he has made his head-quarters for nearly
                  two months."</p>
               <p>"Gintlemen, do you hear that? By the faith of me fathers, Mr. Jennings, it's
                  either you are drunk or you think <emph>I</emph> am! Terrence Tyrconnel was
                  beneath the burning sun of the Equator, aboord the Rio packet, three weeks
                  ago!"</p>
               <p>"I did not speak of Lord Terrence Tyrconnel, sir—who may, indeed, be in a very hot
                  latitude, for I learn that he has been dead for years—though I remember him well.
                  He used to stop here fourteen or fifteen years ago. I could make punch to suit
                     <emph>him</emph>—it was old Monongahela and New England rum that
                     <emph>he</emph> liked!"</p>
               <p>"Troth it was, ould boy; and 'twas that I sent for just now! But what Lord
                  Tyrconnel have you been spaking of?"</p>
               <p>"Lord Dennis Tyrconnel, the nephew of my former patron, who has come into the
                  title and estates since the death of his uncle."</p>
               <p>"Oh, that's it! Is it dead I am, and my title and estates gone to my nephew
                  Dennis?" exclaimed Tyrconnel, so drolly, and so much like his "old self," that
                  Jennings recognized him at once as the same patron to whom he had alluded.</p>
               <p>"But what does it mean. my lord—your name is booked as Mr. O'Reilly?"</p>
               <p>"I'll explain that in good time, Mr. Jennings; and though I'm Terrence Tyrconnel,
                  if ever he lived, you must only know me as Mr. O'Reilly until I choose to reveal
                  the secret."</p>
               <p>"Do you not know <emph>me</emph>, friend Jennings?" asked Watson, in his usual
                  tone.</p>
               <p>"On my honor I do not, sir. It seems to me that I have seen you before, but where
                  or when I cannot say."</p>
               <p>"And yet Dr. Watson was a steady boarder with you for five years."</p>
               <p>"Doctor Watson! Why, it is supposed that he is dead; but, on my word, you bear a
                  strong resemblance to him!"</p>
               <p>"If this beard was off, and we sat in number eleven—my old room—over a bottle of
                  your choice Amontillado, I think you'd know me!" said the doctor.</p>
               <p>"It <emph>is</emph> Doctor Watson, as I live!" cried Jennings, in utter surprise.
                  "When will wonders cease? Why do <emph>you</emph> register in another name?" And
                  the worthy host grasped the extended hand of his old friend and boarder.</p>
               <p>"I cannot explain now; we have got to keep our names concealed until we put the
                  officers of the law on a track which will avenge us for a long and cruel exile
                  from our native homes. But keep our secret, friend Jennings, and you will be the
                  first to hail the hour when we shall be known again as we were!"</p>
               <p>"How does this nephew of mine support the dignity of the title?" asked
                  Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"Very well, my lord—that <emph>is</emph>, Mr. O'Reilly; though I do not think he's
                  quite so fast as you were! He doesn't knock over so many watchmen, or use quite so
                  much liquor, though he is free with his money, I must say!" replied Jennings.</p>
               <p>"You must introduce me to him as a countryman of his, who has long been a resident
                  of South America. Call me O'Reilly, and never drop a hint as to who else I am. I
                  must sound him and see what kind of a chap he is. He's a Tyrconnel on one side and
                  an O'Brien on the other—good, ould stock, if hasn't degenerated!"</p>
               <p>"I will introduce you at any time—he is in his room now."</p>
               <p>"Well, send me up a bowl of punch made in the ould way; and after I get a little
                  of that into me, I'll give him a call, and show him how to make a punch that's a
                  thousand times better than this crame of intimperate timperance here!"</p>
               <p>Jennings left; and in a short time sent up a bowl of punch which suited Tyrconnel
                  perfectly, for he took to it as naturally as a horse would to oats.</p>

               <p>After he had got up steam enough to feel right, Tyrconnel went with his host to
                  receive an introduction to his nephew, as Mr. O'Reilly.</p>
               <p>"You have seen him before, I presume?" said Jennings.</p>
               <p>"Never, since he was a bit of a boy! He'll not know me, now—I don't know myself
                  with all this hair on my face, and catch myself<pb n="90-91"
                     xml:id="VAC6962-00000046"/> bowing to a stranger every time I look in a
                  mirror."</p>
               <p>The next moment they were in the presence of Lord <emph>Dennis</emph>
                  Tyrconnel—the legal heir to Terrence Tyrconnel, if the latter had indeed been
                  dead.</p>
               <p>"Mr. O'Reilly, my lord, whom I take the liberty of introducing because he is a
                  countryman, though long a resident of South America!" said Jennings.</p>
               <p>Lord Tyrconnel—or Lord Dennis, as we will term him—was about twenty-one, not more
                  than that age, if so much; and his pure English, without the brogue, and his
                  rather slender frame, showed that he had not been educated at home, and used to
                  home exercise, like his uncle, but probably had been sent to school and college in
                  the more fashionable vicinity of London.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see Mr. O'Reilly," said his young lordship, with an air of
                  condescension. "A countryman of mine will ever be welcome, no matter where I meet
                  him. Take seats, gentlemen. Jennings, you are near the bell-pull, have the
                  kindness to ring for some wine."</p>
               <p>"Is it <emph>wine</emph> you drink this early in the day, my lord?" asked
                  O'Reilly.</p>
               <p>"Sometimes—perhaps you would like something heavier. Brandy, or punch?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, there you hit the target in the centre, my lord! Let Jennings mix us a punch
                  of ould Monongahela, with a scattering of New England rum in it, and just water
                  enough to apologize for its being found in strange company, and I'll join you in
                  any toast that may come uppermost!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Jennings went out to compound the punch, and Mr. O'Reilly sat down with the
                  air of one who intended to make himself perfectly at home.</p>
               <p>"And so, Lord Dennis, it is yourself that has stepped into the ould shoes of my
                  ould friend, Terrence Tyrconnel?" said he.</p>
               <p>"Ah, did you know my uncle?"</p>
               <p>"Troth, you may well say I did! He and myself were as intimate as brother and
                  sister, when we were boys! Many is the bottle that we've emptied together—many a
                  watchman got the loan of a broken head from our shillala! He was a born divil for
                  fun that uncle of yours. How did he die? Did he break his neck in a steeple-chase,
                  or end his days like a gentleman, with a pistol in his hand and another at ten
                  paces in the hands of a better shot than himself?"</p>
               <p>"We have every reason to suppose that he was murdered in London!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Murdered</emph>? Did they ever find his body?"</p>
               <p>"Not to a certainty; although a corpse, terribly mutilated, was picked up in the
                  Thames some weeks after he was missed from his hotel; and the general supposition
                  was, that it was his. He was missing for several years before I assumed the title
                  and took charge of the estates, by permission of the House of Lords and the Master
                  in Chancery!"</p>
               <p>"Did you ever see your uncle, my lord?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, when I was quite young. I remember his trying to teach me how to jump a
                  gate; and he came very near breaking my neck in the lesson."</p>
               <p>"I suppose you can ride better, now?"</p>
               <p>"Some, though I'm not very fond of the saddle."</p>
               <p>"Can you handle the shillala?"</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to say that I am deficient in a knowledge of that weapon."</p>
               <p>"You can box, though, can you not?" asked the uncle, throwing himself in an
                  attitude which Heenan could not have bettered.</p>
               <p>"I never had the gloves on in my life."</p>
               <p>"Oh, sainted fathers! how your education has been neglected. Why, your uncle was a
                  complate master of the art, and could handle a black-thorn with any man that ever
                  throd on shoe-leather! If your uncle could only come to life, 'twould break his
                  heart to know how you'd been neglected in your bringing up!"</p>
               <p>"Mr. O'Reilly!"</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon, my lord; but you see, knowing your uncle so well, I take an
                  interest in you!"</p>
               <p>"For the sake of <emph>his</emph> memory, sir, I excuse you!" said the young lord,
                  with an air of consequence. "But I do not think that it is necessary to learn the
                  art of handling a stick, or pugilism, to make a man a gentleman!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Perhaps</emph> not, my lord. But such things are very convanient to know
                  sometimes. But you can shoot well—that would run in your blood!"</p>
               <p>"I <emph>am</emph> a fair shot!" replied Lord Dennis.</p>
               <p>"Have you been out yet?"</p>
               <p>"I do not understand you, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Have you been on the ground, and winged your man?"</p>
               <p>"Even yet I do not understand you!"</p>
               <p>"Have you ever fought a duel?"</p>
               <p>"Fought a duel? No, thank Heaven, I have never been placed in a position where it
                  became necessary to fight one!"</p>
               <p>"And you thank heaven for <emph>that!</emph> If I hadn't been tould by Mr.
                  Jennings that you was a Tyrconnel, I'd never belave the fact! Why, your uncle
                  would rather fight any time than to sit down to the best dinner in the land!"</p>
               <p>"I have not my uncle's taste or education, thank heaven!"</p>
               <p>"You haven't—that's as true as gospel! I suppose you can translate Latin; can't
                  you, my lord?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am happy to say I can!"</p>
               <p>"Then, will you be so kind as to translate these words into Latin for me:
                     <emph>Lord Dennis Tyrconnel is a white-livered coward!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Sir!</emph> Mr. O'Reilly, do you mean to insult me?" cried the young
                  Tyrconnel, turning as red as fire, and springing from his chair.</p>
               <p>"I thought I'd bring you to your feet, if you had a drop of your uncle's blood in
                  your veins! I suppose you'll be afther asking satisfaction, and I shall only be
                  too happy to grant it. I've a friend and a doctor both in the house, and over at
                  Weehawken is one of the nicest bits of ground that ever was paced out for an
                  un-paceable purpose!"</p>
               <p>"I do not fight with men beneath me in rank!" said the peer.</p>
               <p>"Then I'll post you for a coward without the translation!"</p>
               <p>"Leave this room, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Divil the bit will I!"</p>
               <p>Lord Dennis rang the bell furiously. A waiter soon appeared.</p>
               <p>"Go and call four more waiters!" said the elder Tyrconnel before his nephew could
                  speak.</p>
               <p>The waiter obeyed and in a few moments five servants entered the room.</p>
               <p>"Turn this man—this villain out of my room!" cried Dennis, almost choking with
                  rage.</p>
               <p>"Let me see you try it!" said the uncle, squaring off scientifically.</p>
               <p>The servants hesitated. The looks of Tyrconnel were not very inviting.</p>
               <p>"Turn him out, and I will pay you well!" cried the young lord.</p>
               <p>The servants, thus encouraged, advanced in a body upon their formidable
                  opponent.</p>
               <p>The next moment three of them lay at full length on the floor, while the other two
                  ingloriously fled from the field of battle.</p>
               <p>"Now that I'm disengaged for a moment," said Tyrconnel, turning upon Lord Dennis,
                  "I'll trouble you to take back the word villain you used a moment ago! Do it
                  quick, or I'll not lave teeth enough in your head to masticate milk-toast
                  with!"</p>
               <p>The probability is that the threat would have been executed, had not Mr. Jennings
                  at that moment entered with the bowl of punch, hastened by the report received
                  from the servants whom he met on the way.</p>
               <p>"Heavens and earth! What is the matter here, gentlemen?" he exclaimed, as he put
                  the bowl of punch down on a table, and sprang between them.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, friend Jennings—nothing: only I'm improving this young gentleman's
                  neglected education. He was so impolite as to bid your servants put me out o'
                  doors; and they were so imprudent as to attempt it. I'm sorry to disturb the pace
                  of your house; but blood is blood, and when mine gets excited, it is apt to boil
                  over!"</p>
               <p>"Come, come, gentlemen; this quarrel can be settled, I hope!"</p>
               <p>"To be sure; nothing in the world asier! Let his lordship find a friend, and I'll
                  put a bullet through his jacket, and shake hands with him afterward!"</p>
               <p>"But my lor—but Mr. <emph>O'Reilly</emph>, the relation—"</p>
               <p>"Hist, ye omadhoun; would you betray me?"</p>
               <p>"But, sir, surely this matter can be settled without a hostile meeting!" said
                  Jennings, pleadingly.</p>
               <p>"No, sir; it cannot!" said the young lord, stepping forward, having recovered from
                  his agitation. "This person has insulted me, and he shall see whether or not I
                  have the Tyrconnel blood in my veins!"</p>
               <p>"There, by me sowl! That sounds like your Uncle Terrence! There's the true grit in
                  you yet; and it's only the fault of your education that it doesn't show more
                  plainly. You'll not have to say <emph>no</emph> the next time you're asked if
                  you've been out! Here's luck to you in a glass of punch that <emph>is</emph>
                  punch. I'll send my friend to you immadiately, so that we can settle our affair at
                  sunrise, when our hands will be steady."</p>
               <p>And Tyrconnel the elder very coolly helped himself to a glass of punch; and then,
                  with a low bow, left the room.</p>
               <p>"You surely will not fight him, my lord?" said Jennings.</p>
               <p>"I surely <emph>will</emph>, sir!" replied Lord Dennis.</p>
               <p>"Not if I can help it," said Mr. Jennings, to himself, as he left the room.</p>
               <p>"What on earth did you quarrel with him for, my lord?" he asked, as he overtook
                  the uncle in the passage.</p>
               <p>"Flesh and blood couldn't help it. He's been spoiled by his education, and hasn't
                  learned the first rudiments of true gentility."</p>
               <p>"But you'll not fight him?"</p>
               <p>"I'll not hurt him; but by me sowl, he shall smell powder!"</p>
               <p>"My lord, it must not be. Remember he is your relation."</p>
               <p>"Not if he shows the <emph>white feather</emph>. That's a plume that was never
                  worn by the Tyrconnels. He's got to meet me and prove himself a man—if he does
                  that, he shall have my friendship; but if he doesn't, I'll ruffle his
                  pin-feathers, and send him back to the ould country with a slim purse and no
                  title, to teach dirty-faced boys how to construe Latin. And mark you, friend
                  Jennings, don't you try to make an interruption in the matter; for if you do,
                  you'll loose four guests to a certainty, and my friendship forever."</p>
               <p>"But, my lord—"</p>
               <p>"Mr. O'Reilly, if you plase, Mr. Jennings."</p>
               <p>"Mr. O'Reilly, then. You will promise not to shoot him?"</p>
               <p>"I won't, without he turns his back to me."</p>
               <p>"Then, sir, I will promise not to interfere. I hope the affair will be conducted
                  as privately as possible. It would injure my house if it were to get out."</p>
               <p>"'Twill be your own fault if it does get out," replied the other.</p>

               <p>When Tyrconnel returned to the rooms of his party, and informed Watson and Andros
                  of the quarrel, and the probability of his being engaged in an "affair of honor,"
                  or rather the certainty of that event in the morning, both of them were surprised
                  and pained at his imprudence. But Watson—who had learned to love him dearly from
                  long association and consequent knowledge of his truly good heart, though
                  sometimes led astray by quick impulses—agreed, of course, to accompany him to the
                  field as surgeon, while Andros was to act as his second.</p>
               <p>"It shall not in the slightest interfere with your other business," said
                  Tyrconnel. "It can all be attended to in less than two hours in the morning."</p>
               <p>A deep groan from one corner of the room, <unclear>told</unclear> that a fourth
                  party had overheard the <unclear>intimation</unclear> imparted by Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"It's that owl of humanity, Jones," said the latter, as he cast a glance in the
                  direction from which the sound came. "Have you a pain in the <choice>
                     <sic>stomarch</sic>
                     <corr>stomach</corr>

                  want to go."</p>
               <p>"Oh, oh, my lord! you'll either be killed, or else be a murderer!" groaned the
                  long-visaged Jones.</p>
               <p>"Be still with your nonsense, you mummy! And hark you—if you breathe a single word
                  about this to any one else, I'll slice off both your ears and make a cropped our
                  of you!"</p>
               <p>"Shall I take your measure for a coffin, my lord? I've a cousin that's an
                  undertaker, if he is yet in the land of the living. He did live in Bleeker
                  street."</p>
               <p>"Oh, be my sowl! it is funny you are getting to be. Why don't you go to see if
                  Mrs. Jones and the seven little children are yet in the land of the living?"</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid to, my lord. I'm afraid she has gone and got married to some Brown, or
                  Smith, or Green. If she hasn't, she'll think I'm a ghost when she sees me, and be
                  frightened to death; and there'll be a catastrophe, and the funeral expenses. Oh,
                  dear! I wish we had staid at Lookoheva—I got resigned to my fate, and wasn't
                  afraid of any catastrophe."</p>
               <p>"Oh, be off with your folly, and order up another bowl of punch for Mr.
                  O'Reilly."</p>
               <p>"I read in a paper this morning, sir, that the manufactures had got to putting
                  strychnine in their liquor!" groaned Jones.</p>
               <p>"I'll put some in your coffee if you don't mind what I tell you, and take your
                  pracher-looking face out of this!"</p>
               <p>With a most melancholy sigh, Jones turned and left room.</p>

               <p>When night came on, Andros and the doctor, wrapping themselves in their cloaks,
                  set out to look for the Birdsalls and Elfrida—for they could not restrain their
                  impatience any longer.</p>
               <p>Tyrconnel had persuaded Jones into going on a search for Mrs. Jones and the seven
                  junior Joneses; and having settled himself comfortably beside a fresh bowl of
                  punch, with <title>Bell's Life in London</title> in his hands, had been left by
                  them at the hotel to await their return.</p>
               <p>This he was the more contented to do, for his mind had been made easy by a call
                  from the friend of Lord Dennis Tyrconnel, and an arrangement for the duel to come
                  off at sun-rise the next morning, on the far-famed and well-known "Burr and
                  Hamilton ground," at Weehawken.</p>
               <p>Watson and Andros at once hurried to the spot where the building once occupied by
                  the Birdsalls had stood. But the humble dwelling was no longer there—its site was
                  occupied by large stores, and only could they determine it by an old building on
                  the opposite side of the street, which had not yet given way before the strides of
                  progress and modern improvement.</p>
               <p>An elderly policeman was leaning against a lamp-post near by, scanning them
                  closely, perhaps suspicioning that they wanted to "open a store" on their own
                  account, with a crow-bar and false keys for a capital. To him they applied for
                  information.</p>
               <p>"Did you ever know a family named Birdsall, which lived hereabout?" asked the
                  doctor.</p>
               <p>"Birdsall?" asked the elderly policeman.</p>
               <p>"Yes; Jonathan and Betsy Birdsall were their names."</p>
               <p>"It seems to me that I do remember them. I believe they were burned up in the old
                  house here!" said the man.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Burned up!</emph>" exclaimed both Andros and Watson, in tones which
                  expressed their horror.</p>
               <p>"Yes—leastwise I think so, though I wasn't on the police then. But I've heard
                  others that were, talk about it. I guess they can tell you all about it in that
                  old house there," he added, pointing across the street.</p>
               <p>The doctor and Andros hastened across the street, and rapped with the
                  old-fashioned lion's-head knocker on the door.</p>
               <p>Quite an old woman opened the door, and in reply to their inquiry, said:</p>
               <p>"La me, yes! I knew old Granny Birdsall and her man Jonathan well! Many's the
                  pennyworth of snuff I bought of the poor old souls. But they were both burned up
                  in the dreadful fire that swept that block, ever so long ago—fifteen years, I
                  reckon 'twas."</p>
               <p>"Did the child they had in their care perish with them?" asked Andros, with
                  tremulous anxiety.</p>
               <p>"No; one of the fire-fellers got it out safe—he got out granny Birdsall; but she,
                  poor soul, was dead gone!"</p>
               <p>"What became of the child?" asked both of the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>"I don't know. The fire-fellers took care of it, I believe. So I heard; but never
                  heard any more about it after the fire. It was a sweet baby; I never saw it but
                  once, when Granny Birdsall was a dressing of it; and I asked her what it had on
                  its arm, so blue; and what do you think it was?"</p>
               <p>"What was it?" asked the doctor, who had not been informed by Andros of the mark
                  he had placed there.</p>
               <p>"Its name, <emph>Elfrida</emph>, in blue letters, that couldn't be washed out! She
                  said the poor thing's father put it there, so it mightn't get lost!"</p>
               <p>Watson looked at Andros for an explanation.</p>
               <p>"The woman speaks the truth. I so marked the child when I last saw it," said the
                  latter.</p>
               <p>"Oh, <emph>my!</emph> Are you the father of that poor baby; and haven't you found
                  it yet?" said the garrulous old woman. "Poor thing, I wonder if it is living
                  yet?"</p>
               <p>"I hope so!" said Andros, and he placed a large piece of gold in the woman's hand.
                  "You need not tell any one of this visit, or the questions we have asked;" he
                  continued. "We will probably come to see you again."</p>
               <p>"Do, if you hear anything of the poor baby!" said the woman. "I won't tell anybody
                  that you've been here; for I'm not much given to talking."</p>
               <p>"What shall we do now, to find my child out?" asked Andros, as they turned up the
                  street.</p>
               <p>"Advertise!" said the doctor. "I will frame an advertisement, with a large reward
                  named, which will be sure to bring us some news of her—whether she is living or
                  dead. I will also go to the office of the <title>Evening Post,</title> and get
                  permission to look over their old files. If I can find an account of the fire, the
                  name of the fireman who rescued the child will probably be mentioned, and perhaps
                  I may find it stated what was done with the child."</p>
               <p>"I hope to Heaven you may! I shall be in agony until I know where she is. It is
                  terrible for a young girl to be poor and friendless in this great city. She were
                  far more safe in a howling wilderness; for beasts are more merciful than men to
                  the helpless who are beautiful!"</p>
               <p>They now returned to their hotel—for the doctor wished, if possible, to get the
                  advertisement, which he hastened to prepare, into the morning newspapers.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LXVII.</head>
               <p>According to promise, the carriage of Mrs. Emma Harcourt called for Elfrida on the
                  day following that on which she first made that lady's acquaintance. And, rather
                  to the astonishment of Susy—who thought it very condescending—Mrs. Harcourt came
                  in it herself.</p>
               <p>"I was out shopping," said she, "and I thought I could as well stop on my way home
                  as not. I have bought a present for your beautiful little boy—I think he will look
                  so nice in them!"</p>
               <p>And she took from a package, which the footman brought in, a beautiful boy's suit
                  of velvet, trimmed with gold lace, and a jaunty hat, with an ostrich feather in
                  it.</p>
               <p>The fond mother's eyes glittered with joy as she looked upon the elegant gift, and
                  she could scarcely keep back a tear.</p>
               <p>"You are too kind! Really, I cannot think of taking such a costly gift from
                  you!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, it is nothing—nothing to me; but it will be such a pleasure to see him wear
                  them. Come here, Sammy, and let me put this hat on your head."</p>
               <p>"Not 'less muzzer says I may," said Sammy, sturdily—though his eyes rested
                  anxiously on the pretty garments.</p>
               <p>"They are yours, Sammy—thank the good lady for them; and, if she will let you,
                  give her a kiss."</p>
               <p>"Not till I wash my face, muzzer. I've been playing love with de cat!"</p>
               <p>"And I know you will excuse me—here is a dress for your mother and one for
                  yourself. You were <emph>so</emph> kind to me, yesterday, that it would make me
                  feel wretched if I could do nothing in return!" continued Mrs. Harcourt.</p>
               <p>Susan could not refuse the gifts so gracefully presented, and she could scarcely
                  find words to express her gratitude.</p>
               <p>"I did not bring you anything, Miss Elfy," Mrs. Harcourt said, "for I thought we
                  would go shopping together while you were with me, and then I could consult your
                  own taste."</p>
               <p>"You are very kind, madam; but I neither deserve nor desire any presents!" said
                  Elfrida.</p>
               <p>"Ah! that is the way with those who deserve the most—they are always the least
                  conscious of it!"</p>
               <p>"I think you flatter me, Mrs. Harcourt!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I do not, my dear girl; but do get ready and go home with me!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Elfy—you have worked so hard of late, that you really deserve a holiday.
                  Come, I will help you to dress!" said Susy.</p>
               <p>Ah! little did Susy dream of the fearful peril before poor Elfrida, or she would
                  not have been in such a hurry to dress her for the sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Elfrida, having promised to go, could not now withdraw her consent very well;
                  nevertheless, she felt a disinclination to leave the roof which had so long
                  covered her—the home where she had seen much of pleasure—little of sorrow.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harcourt seemed to be <emph>very</emph> kind; yet there was something in her
                  looks or manner which seemed distasteful to Elfrida. She could not say what it
                  was; but she felt an inward shrinking of the spirit, which she could not cast off
                  and scarcely could conceal.</p>
               <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6962-00000048"/>
               <p>And thus it ever is when the pure meet the impure. I care not how the latter may
                  be disguised—how elegant their garb—how specious their address—an innocent spirit,
                  by some unseen and nameless power, discerns the guilt of its opposite, and shrinks
                  from it intuitively.</p>
               <p>Elfrida, however, was soon dressed, and almost tearfully kissing Susy and Sammy a
                  good-bye, she followed Mrs. Harcourt to her carriage.</p>
               <p>The latter was driven rapidly along Laight street until it reached Canal street,
                  and up this street till within two or three blocks of Broadway, where it stopped
                  before rather a dingy-looking building for that street of great architectural
                  varieties.</p>
               <p>"There is a poor sick woman whom I must call on here—she has a single room in the
                  upper part of this building!" said Mrs. Harcourt to Elfrida. "Will you not go up
                  with me? A sight of your cheerful young face may do the invalid as much good as
                  the things which I am going to take to her. She win believe that an angel of mercy
                  has come to visit her!"</p>
               <p>Elfrida began to think a great deal better of Mrs. Harcourt.</p>
               <p>"That could not be a bad heart," said she, to herself, "which feels for the sick
                  and distressed."</p>
               <p>And without any hesitation, she alighted from the carriage to follow Mrs.
                  Harcourt.</p>
               <p>"You can go to the store and get my other purchases, James," said the latter to
                  the coachman, "and then call for us when you return."</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am," replied the servant, returning the meaning glance which she had
                  given him.</p>
               <p>"Come, Elfy, dear," said Mrs. Harcourt; and she led the way up the narrow stair
                  case.</p>
               <p>Elfy noticed that a man with a dissipated, repulsive-looking face stood on the
                  landing, at the head of the first pair of stairs, and she shrunk from his eager
                  gaze; but as he stepped aside without speaking and let them pass, she thought no
                  more of it, but followed Mrs. Harcourt up to the third story of the building. Here
                  they passed through a large, commonly-furnished, but tenantless room, and then
                  entered a smaller one, which was quite elegantly-furnished, but also
                  unoccupied.</p>
               <p>Elfrida was about to ask where the invalid was, when Mrs. Harcourt, who had turned
                  back, suddenly stepped out of the room, and closed the door, locking it on the
                  outside.</p>
               <p>In an instant, the terrible treachery became plain to Elfrida. She was a prisoner
                  She sprang to the only window in the room, which appeared to "look out" upon the
                  blank wall of some large manufactory.</p>
               <p>Alas! it was iron-grated!</p>
               <p>She turned and tried the door. It was of dark, solid oak, and firm and
                  heavily-ironed. "<emph>Mrs. Harcourt!</emph> MRS. HARCOURT!" she screamed.</p>
               <p>"What is wanting, my love?" asked the female fiend from without.</p>
               <p>"Oh! do unlock the door, and let me out! I know you have only done this to
                  frighten me—do let me out!"</p>
               <p>A mocking laugh from the <emph>lady</emph> was first heard, and then she
                  replied:</p>
               <p>"Make yourself comfortable there, Miss Elfy. I don't mean you any harm, but there
                  is a nice young gentleman in love with you, and I have made this arrangement for
                  him. When he comes, <emph>perhaps</emph> he will let you out—perhaps, I say!"</p>
               <p>"God help me!" moaned the poor girl.</p>
               <p>"You needn't call on God—he hasn't anything to do with New York! The devil reigns
                  here, with a grand lot of assistants—preachers, judges, black-mail editors, and
                  the like!"</p>
               <p>And the woman, after uttering this string of remarks, went away, laughing.</p>
               <p>Many a poor girl thus situated would have sunk down in helpless despair and given
                  up all hope. But Elfrida was not of common mold. She had a fearless heart—one
                  which would not shrink from death, if there was a choice between that and
                  degradation.</p>
               <p>She neither fainted or went to weeping, but she at once carefully examined every
                  part of the room, to see if there was not some weak spot where she could work for
                  freedom. But finding none, she took from her pocket one of those small,
                  keen-bladed knives used by seamstresses for cutting button-holes, ripping scams,
                  etc.; and as she looked upon it, said:</p>
               <p>"I am not utterly defenceless, thank Heaven! It shall go hard with any one who
                  strives to wrong me. It would be terrible to take life, but dishonor is far more
                  fearful!"</p>
               <p>And then she put the knife away; and with a calmness that was wonderful, went to a
                  centre-table on which several books were scattered, and taking up one, went to
                  reading it.</p>

               <p>There is not a more beautiful spot in the vicinity of. New York than that part of
                  Weehawken where Alexander Hamilton received his death-wound from the hands of
                  Aaron Burr. It is on the west bank of the Hudson, on the Jersey shore, opposite
                  the upper end of the city, and has been desecrated in later days by other affairs
                  less honorable than that which first gave it celebrity.</p>
               <p>The sun had not reddened the fringe of the grey cloak of dawn, when a boat
                  containing four persons beside the oarsmen, "might have been seen" swiftly rowing
                  from the foot of Desbrosses street, toward the above-named dueling-ground.</p>
               <p>The first of the four was Terrence Tyrconnel; the second, <emph>his</emph> second,
                  Gerald Andros; the third Doctor Watson; and the fourth, Mr. Jones—who said, that
                  if somebody had to be killed, he'd like to see it.</p>
               <p>He had returned to the hotel with the melancholy news that Mrs. Jones had married
                  one of the "Smiths," and had emigrated with her brood to California, whither he
                  was determined <emph>not</emph> to follow her."</p>
               <p>The boat had but just reached the landing, when it was followed by another, which,
                  as it came near, was found to contain Lord Dennis Tyrconnel and his second; also
                  Mr. Jennings, of the "City"—whose anxiety to prevent bloodshed was as great as
                  ever.</p>
               <p>But he received due caution from the seconds of both parties not to interfere, and
                  with agonizing anxiety saw the deadly preliminaries arranged.</p>
               <p>Knowing the good effects of "a friendly drop in season," he had brought over a
                  bottle of old brandy, which with a glass he tendered to Tyrconnel the elder.</p>
               <p>"Thank ye, ould boy—you've a blessed memory. Long life to you!" said the latter,
                  as he filled his glass. Then, as he glanced at his antagonist, who shivered with
                  the chill of the morning air, he advanced to him, and in as polite a tone as if he
                  was his best friend, said:</p>
               <p>"Let me beg you to take a drop of this ould stuff, my lord! It will take the raw
                  chill of the air off, and steady your hand. Don't be backward, for I shall take a
                  horn myself, after you have drank!"</p>
               <p>The offer was made so courteously, that the young man could not refuse it; but,
                  with a grave smile, took the glass and drank to the health of the man against whom
                  he was so soon to raise his hand.</p>
               <p>Tyrconnel took the empty glass, and having filled it, said:</p>
               <p>"Here's to the memory of your lamented uncle, my lord—if your shot is sure, you'll
                  be afther drinking it many a time afther this, I'm thinking."</p>
               <p>"We are all ready, gentlemen," said Andros, coming forward.</p>
               <p>"And so are we!" said Tyrconnel. Then turning to Lord Dennis, he added: "Here is
                  my hand, my lord, in token that I hold no bad blood to you, though I fight you—and
                  if you should happen to send me out of this world, in a few minutes, why, I lave
                  you my forgiveness, and a blessing to boot!"</p>
               <p>The young lord took his hand and said, gravely:</p>
               <p>"Though you have insulted me, sir, I really feel no ill-will toward you; and were
                  it not necessary to my honor that I should fight you, would most sincerely regret
                  to do so!"</p>
               <p>"For the life o' me, boy, I can't help liking you! The Tyrconnel blood shows now,
                  for you're as cool as a coquette at a dismissal!" said Tyrconnel, as he turned
                  away to take his position.</p>
               <p>The other did not speak, but went to the spot pointed out by his second, and
                  received his weapon without a word. With as much calmness as if he had been used
                  to such matters, and was not "out" for the first time, he listened to the
                  directions about firing, which were as usual—"fire, one, two,
                  <emph>three</emph>—stop"—and as his second stepped back, looked his antagonist in
                  the eye firmly, but without animosity.</p>
               <p>The word was given, and both fired nearly at the same moment; the elder Tyrconnel
                  firing his pistol off in the air, while the other evidently took aim at him.</p>
               <p>"By me sowl you're a good shot, my lord!" said the elder, as he took off his hat
                  and showed a ball-hole through it, just above the rim. "A half inch lower, and
                  you'd have not left me any brains to brag of."</p>
               <p>"But you did not fire at me, sir!" said the other.</p>
               <p>"No, by me sowl! Do you think I'd harm my own flesh and blood? I was only trying
                  your mettle, my lad; and there's no metal better than a pair of cast-steel
                  barrels, with an ounce-ball-bore for that!"</p>
               <p>"Your own flesh and blood, sir—what do you mean?" exclaimed the mystified <choice>
                     <sic>young young</sic>
                     <corr>young</corr>
                  </choice> peer.</p>
               <p>"He speaks truly, sir. He is your own uncle, Lord Terrence Tyrconnel!" said
                  Jennings, as he came forward.</p>
               <p>And as the statement was at once verified by Doctor Watson, and the nephew had
                  some remembrance of his uncle's features, he could not doubt it, but at once
                  embraced him, saying, that though he lost a fortune and a peerage, he was but too
                  happy in finding an uncle—and a thousand times more happy that he had missed his
                  aim, even though so narrowly.</p>
               <p>"Divil the bit shall you lose either fortune or the peerage, my boy," cried his
                  uncle. "I'll not go back to claim the one, and I'll be satisfied with enough of
                  the other to make me aisy in the blessed land of my adoption, swate America!"</p>
               <p>"I shall never listen to <emph>that</emph>, dear uncle," said Dennis, who—though
                  somewhat "set up" by a college education, and a position which had come to him
                  while he was too young to check a false pride—was really a noble-hearted fellow.
                  "We will go back to Ireland together; and if, after you have lived a long life of
                  happiness and honor, I shall survive you, I will then be willing to wear the title
                  now justly yours!"</p>
               <p>"Well, well, my boy, this will be a matter to argue by-and-by, when I've explained
                  to you the <emph>reason</emph> that I've been dead so long. But now I feel as if a
                  bit of breakfast would be better than an hour in purgatory. I say, Jennings, you
                  haven't emptied that bottle, have you?!"</p>
               <p>"No, my lord; but we'll empty a dozen of my best on the termination of this
                     matter,<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6962-00000049"/> as soon as we get over to the
                  city. Here is the bottle, my lord, two-thirds full of the best brandy that my
                  cellar affords!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Jennings, you're a man afther me own soul! It's few men that know how to kape
                  a hotel; but by me faith, you're one of them!"</p>
               <p>The party, having "refreshed" all around, re-entered their boats, and were
                  speedily taken back to the city; where, having liberally rewarded their boatmen,
                  they went back to their quarters—all joyful but Jones, who was disappointed in not
                  having seen anybody killed.</p>

               <p>"So you've got'er, Phone?" said Captain Barrington, as the bold, bad woman came
                  down from her imprisoned victim, and entered the bar-room of the
                  establishment.</p>
               <p>"To be sure I have! It has cost me sixty or seventy dollars to carry it out; but
                  I'll make Corryell refund that. I've done the job up prime!"</p>
               <p>"So you 'ave, hold girl! 'Ow does she take it—heasy or 'ard?"</p>
               <p>"I hardly know yet. She hasn't had time to know how she feels yet, herself. I left
                  her before any tantrums had showed themselves."</p>
               <p>"I s'pose I'd better go and tell 'Arry that his bird is caged?"</p>
               <p>"You needn't hurry about it. I don't want him to come before night; and he has got
                  to hand over the blunt before he see's her!"</p>
               <p>"Hisn't she a beauty? I never saw an 'andsomer girl in Hamerica!"</p>
               <p>"She <emph>is</emph> a beauty, and you bargained with Corryell at too low a price
                  altogether. I'll get three or four hundred more out of him, as sure as my name is

               <p>"I reckon I'll take a drink, cap—I never was so thirsty in all my life! Lying is
                     <emph>dry</emph> work!"</p>
               <p>"That depends hon the kind of lying, Phone," said the captain, as he went to get
                  the particular bottle. "I s'pose fashionable lying must be rather dry work—some
                  pulpit lying is; and then hagain there's hother pulpit lying that hisn't. I
                  remember well, in London, when I was honly a pick-pocket—a mere boy, hafore I was
                  promoted to be a regular cracksman—I used to go to a chapel near Charing Cross,
                  where the preacher halmost halways cried 'alf through his sermons. I used to go
                  there, 'cause there was halways a crowd of women there—hold maids and fat dowagers
                  and the like—and I made a 'heap of money by it!"</p>
               <p>The captain poured out two glasses of brandy—one for himself and one for Phone—and
                  then continued:</p>
               <p>"That weepin' preacher turned hout to be a 'ard case, hafter hall. He was tried
                  and convicted for 'aving six wives, and trying to get hanother, after that! Hand I
                  believe they 'ad a case of forgery hagainst 'im, too—hat hany rate, he was
                  transported for life. Now, a man that told folks 'ow to be good, and pretended to
                  be so 'imself, and was halways a cryin' hover the sins of the world, and was has
                  bad has the worst be'ind the world's back, was what I call a <emph>wet</emph>

               <p>"I don't know anything about preachers." said Phone; "they never were in my
                  line—except a young 'un, once, who said he was in love with me. I fell in love
                  with his watch, and borrowed it, and that's the last I ever saw of him. If I had
                  met him again, I suppose he'd have given me a lecture as long as eternity on the

               <p>A pleasant breakfast party was that which met in the private dining-room attached
                  to parlor No. 3, at the City Hotel, after the conclusion of the "affair" at
                  Weehawken. The two Tyrconnels, Andros, Doctor Watson, Mr. Van Rensellaer—the late
                  second of the young Lord Dennis—and Mr. Jennings composed the party, while every
                  luxury the house could afford, either from the larder or cellar, was to be found
                  upon the table.</p>
               <p>After breakfast, Tyrconnel retired with his nephew to give him a much-desired
                  explanation regarding his singular and lengthy absence, while Andros and the

               <p>"If you will remain here, Captain Andros," said the doctor, "I will go to the
                  office of the paper I speak of, and see if I can find any account of the fire and
                  rescue in its local columns. A file, I know, has been kept from its start, and
                  they are generally very particular in local news. You can find some queer
                  Wall-street history in its earlier numbers."</p>
               <p>"I will remain, doctor; for I hope most earnestly that we may hear something
                  through the advertisement," replied Andros.</p>
               <p>"I shall not be gone long," said the doctor. "After I come back, I think that we
                  will consult a lawyer in regard to the steps to be taken with that she-devil,
                  Mildollar!"</p>
               <p>"It will be best. Were she not a woman, I would counsel a less tardy measure of
                  punishment ment. But being a woman, I suppose that we must leave her to the
                  law."</p>
               <p>"Would it not be well to beat up her quarters, and see what she is doing?"</p>
               <p>"It will be well to <emph>have</emph> it done; but she would recognize either one
                  of us in spite of disguises; for an eye of guilt is ever keen and on the alert.
                  And were she to know that we were here, she would take measures to elude the hands
                  of justice."</p>
               <p>"That is true. I will think out a plan of action while I am out," said the doctor.
                  "When I return, if you approve of it, we will adopt it. I am not naturally
                  revengeful, but even if we find your child, and take from the old hag the money
                  which is Elfrida's by right, I shall not feel satisfied for the long and dreary
                  exile from home and friends which I have endured. If I could send her to the
                  Island of Lookoheva for the rest of her natural life, I believe I could forgive

               <p>Doctor Watson returned very soon to the hotel, after his visit to the office of
                  the <title>Evening Post;</title> for he there found an account of the fire, the
                  death of the two Birdsalls, and the noble rescue of a young child by a fireman
                  named Samuel Latrobe, who twice periled his life on the occasion, as he had once
                  before at a previous fire, in which he had also been successful in saving
                  life.</p>
               <p>"How can we find this man?" asked Andros, after the doctor had related his success
                  thus far.</p>
               <p>"I will look in the directory—if he is a householder his name will be there!
                  Jones, go and get me a city directory for this year."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Jones, as he moved off at a dead-march step for the book. "You'll
                  find Joneses enough in it, and Browns too!" he added, with a groan—most likely
                  thinking of his lost spouse.</p>
               <p>In a short time he returned, for the book was in the hotel office.</p>
               <p>The doctor opened it, and readily found the name of "Samuel Latrobe, mechanic,
                  house No. — Laight street."</p>
               <p>"Let us go there at once!" said Andros, impatiently.</p>
               <p>"I will be ready in a few moments," said the doctor. "Where is Lord Tyrconnel,
                  Jones?"</p>
               <p>"Off with his nephew, sir, teaching him <emph>gentility</emph>, I believe. I saw a
                  pair of single-sticks and two pairs of boxing-gloves being carried to the room of
                  the youngest one when I was down stairs, just now."</p>
               <p>"There is a man below, sir, who wishes to see the gentlemen of Room No. 3, that
                  advertised in the morning paper," said a waiter belonging to the hotel, at this
                  moment.</p>
               <p>"Show him up at once," said the doctor. "I'll wager a dollar to a dime, that it is
                  the very man we were just talking of!" he added.</p>
               <p>"I hope that your surmise is correct," said Andros, anxiously.</p>
               <p>"We will soon know," replied Watson. And even while he was speaking, the door
                  opened, and a man in the full prime and vigor of manhood, entered—whose clear eye,
                  ruddy face, and well-knit frame, proclaimed, even sooner than his plain garb, that
                  he was a workingman—one of that class whom politicians call the bone and sinew of
                  the nation, just before election, but whose interests they ever neglect
                  afterward.</p>
               <p>"Are you the gentleman that put an advertisement in the <title>Sun</title>
                  newspaper, about a girl that was rescued from a fire a long while ago, sir?" he
                  asked, of Doctor Watson.</p>
               <p>"I am; and your name is Sam Latrobe, is it not?"</p>
               <p>"That's my name, sir. But are you that girl's father, sir?"</p>
               <p>"No; that gentleman is," replied the doctor, pointing to Andros. "He has been long
                  absent from this country, and only last night learned that the good people with
                  whom he left the child had been burned up with their house, and that the child had
                  been rescued by a noble fireman. But where <emph>is</emph> the child—or rather the
                  young lady; for she must be grown up by this time?"</p>
               <p>"If he is her father, he must know what name it is that is marked on her arm,"
                  said Sam, cautiously; for he felt loth to lose "Elfy" at any rate, and was
                  determined that no false claimant should have her.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Elfrida</emph>—I put it there with my own hand!" said Andros. "Where is
                  she? speak quickly, and relieve me from suspense!"</p>
               <p>"Until yesterday, she has never been from under my mother's roof more than two or
                  three hours at a time, since I took her from the fire!" said Latrobe. "But
                  yesterday, she went away on a visit with a Mrs. Harcourt, who said she lived in
                  Bond street, and who was to bring her back last night. But she did not, and had
                  not when I saw this advertisement this morning. I went to my boss to get excused
                  from work to-day, and coming back, I came through Bond street, and asked all along
                  for the house of Mrs. Harcourt; but no one knew her there, or where such a lady
                  lived."</p>
               <p>"Who is this Mrs. Harcourt?" asked the doctor, as a dreadful suspicion of a
                  terrible wrong came athwart his mind.</p>
               <p>"I don't know, sir. She got acquainted at our house through an accident—her
                  carriage was broken before our door, and she was brought <choice>
                     <sic>in in</sic>
                     <corr>in</corr>
                  </choice> a faint. Susy—that is my wife—says she is a splendid, sweet-spoken lady,
                  who seems to be very rich! But I don't like the looks of things; for Bond street
                  is a short street, and if she lived there, she ought to be well known in it."</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6962-00000050"/>
               <p>"There is no such name in the directory," said the doctor, who had in vain looked
                  for it.</p>
               <p>"Has no one paid her attentions, and been refused, who might for revenge seek her
                  injury?" asked Andros.</p>
               <p>"Bless your heart, sir, not a soul! I've been all that a brother could be to her,
                  and kept the chaps away, you may bet your life. Of course, they'd look at her when
                  she went out; for she as handsome as a picture, and as pure as an angel. But that
                  was all. A fellow who called himself a gentleman, and wore fine clothes, followed
                  her home a week or ten days ago, and insulted her. But I was at home when she got
                  there, and I <emph>lammed</emph> him from the word go! I put his face into shape
                  for a witness in an Irish riot-case, and tumbled him, nice clothes and all, into
                  the gutter. He went away threatening; but that was the last of
                  <emph>him!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps not," said the doctor, as he shook his head gloomily. "In a city like
                  this, where money will gloss over every wrong, hire assassins, or even worse
                  characters, we hardly know what evil may not be done. We must get the aid of the
                  detective police at once. If I can get that keenest of all officers, Captain
                  Leonard, on the least sign of a <unclear>track</unclear>, he will follow it to a
                  certainty. He and his friend Brown—"</p>
               <p>A deep groan from Jones interrupted the doctor; and the latter paused to ask what
                  was the matter.</p>
               <p>"Don't speak of <emph>Brown,</emph> sir, for mercy's sake!" groaned Jones. "'Twas
                  a Brown that took my wife and seven children off to Californy!"</p>
               <p>"Not this Brown to whom I allude," said the doctor. "Though almost as good-looking
                  as his friend Leonard, he is so bashful that he would sooner run away from than
                  with a woman."</p>
               <p>"I can't help it, sir; but the very name of Brown goes into my in'ards sharper
                  than vinegar! If there had never been a Brown, Mrs. Jones would have been Mrs.
                  Jones yet. But she isn't, and I'm <emph>done brown</emph>—and so is she."</p>
               <p>And Jones uttered another doleful groan,</p>
               <p>"We have no time for trifling!" said Andros, impatiently. "Every hour will be a
                  protraction of my torture, until my poor child is found. My noble fellow, you'll
                  help us, will you not?" he added, to Sam.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; but I'm not a noble fellow. I'm only a New York mechanic."</p>
               <p>"A nobler set of men do not exist on earth, than they are!" said Doctor Watson. "I
                  know their worth. As a body, they are in heart and soul as much superior to the
                  kid-gloved aristocrats who despise them, as the sun in its mid-day splendor is
                  superior to the flickering light of a penny candle, stuck into the neck of an
                  empty rum-bottle! He will recompense you well for your lost time, Mr. Latrobe, and
                  see that your employer does not blame you for neglect of work."</p>
               <p>"I don't want any pay, sir, for doing my duty—I never did! But you can do me one
                  favor."</p>
               <p>"Name it, Mr. Latrobe—name it!"</p>
               <p>"Please don't Mister me, sir! That's all! I'm not used to it, and it sets as
                  uneasy as a new boot with the pegs left stickin' up. Just call me Sam, and I'll
                  know who you mean, and do what you want me to."</p>
               <p>"Well, Sam, since you will have it so," said the doctor; "if you will go with us,
                  we will get the aid of the officers we have spoken of, and go and see your
                  lady."</p>
               <p>"I haven't got any lady, sir. I have a dear little wife, my Susy—but she's only a
                  woman, she isn't a lady," said Sam, interrupting the doctor, who smiled at the
                  very material correction, and continued:</p>
               <p>"Well, Sam, after we get the officers we'll go and see your little womanly wife,
                  and get a description of the lady and her equipage, and from that make a start in
                  search of Elfrida."</p>
               <p>"I'm all ready for that, sir!" said Sam.</p>
               <p>"Won't you take some refreshments, Sam—a glass of wine or brandy—before we start?"
                  asked the doctor.</p>
               <p>"No, thank you, sir. I used to go to the 'Widder's' with the boys, and take my
                  toddy as fast and strong as any of 'em. But my Susy (bless her dear heart!) got me
                  out of that notion long ago; and though I haven't signed no anti-temptation
                  pledge, I hold off from all strong stuff for her sake," replied Sam.</p>
               <p>"You act nobly in so doing, and benefit your health as well as your pocket!" said
                  the doctor. "But we must be on the move. Jones, you can stay here, and if Lord
                  Tyrconnel comes in, tell him that we are absent on business, and he can enjoy
                  himself with his nephew."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Jones. Then he added: '<foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto
                     voce</foreign>,' in teaching him gentility by knocking him down with muffled
                  fists, or breaking his head with a big stick. I wish he had that Brown under
                  teaching for a season."</p>

               <p>For several hours, poor Elfrida remained in her prison—for nothing else could she
                  call the room in which she was confined, though it was so elegant in furniture and
                  adornment; and during this time, she heard no sounds except that dull, continual
                  thunder of carts, carriages, drays, cars, and trampling feet which falls so
                  heavily upon a stranger's ear in New York, but is scarcely noticed by the ear of
                  the long-accustomed citizen.</p>
               <p>She had apparently been engrossed in reading; but a hundred times she had started,
                  and nervously clutched the only weapon in her possession, as she fancied that she
                  heard footsteps and the sound of voices approaching the room. At last, it became
                  so dark that she could not read; and she went to the little window, to see if
                  there would not be some light in view; but the cold, dark wall of which we have
                  spoken was only before her—she could see nothing more.</p>
               <p>But shortly after the twilight deepened into darkness, she heard a light footstep
                  approach her door; and a moment later, the door was unlocked, and Phone entered,
                  with a light and a large tray, upon which wine, cakes, and other food could be
                  seen.</p>
               <p>The first idea of Elfrida was, to rush past Phone, and to endeavor to make her
                  escape; but as the woman entered, the door was closed behind her, and the sound of
                  the lock told that some one was outside, on guard.</p>
               <p>"I've brought some supper for you, Miss Elfy, and am very glad to see that you
                  have not spoiled your good looks in crying, or any of that sort of foolishness,"
                  said the woman. "Your <emph>beau</emph> will be perfectly enchanted when he comes
                  here, by-and-by, to see you."</p>
               <p>"He may be disenchanted, then, very suddenly," said Elfrida, quietly. "As to
                  crying, I am not one of the crying kind. But I warn you, woman, whoever you are,
                  that my friends will make you dearly rue the treachery you have used in getting me
                  here."</p>
               <p>"They might, if they only knew where you were, my dear!" said Phone, coolly.</p>
               <p>"They'll find me—they will hunt the whole city over for me!" said the undaunted
                  girl.</p>
               <p>"Did you ever hear of people looking through a haystack for a lost needle?" asked
                  Phone, with provoking coolness. "New York is a great city; and your friends will
                  have to look a long time before they find Mrs. Emma Harcourt!"</p>
               <p>"You mean the brazen hussy who has assumed that name, for her own base purposes;
                  for I know that it is not your real name!" said Elfrida, scornfully.</p>
               <p>"Look you here, girl: if I was not to get a price for your beauty, I'd spoil your
                  face for that speech!" said Phone, angrily.</p>
               <p>"Give her a dig hunder the heye hanyway, to pay for that sauce!" cried a gruff
                  voice—evidently that of the sentinel outside.</p>
               <p>"Mind your own business, cap.!" cried Phone. "I know how to deal with this
                  tiger-cat. I don't want to spoil her beauty before her beau sees her, and pays
                  over; but after that, I'll cut her nails, or my name isn't Phone! Here's some
                  supper for you, girl!" she continued. "You'd better eat and drink, and make
                  yourself contented, for you're as fast as if you were in Sing Sing!"</p>
               <p>"An institution which will yet be honored by your presence, or I'm not a prophet!"
                  said Elfrida, bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Let me out, cap., or I'll get so mad that I can't help spoiling her beauty!"
                  cried Phone, enraged at the taunting words and tone of the brave girl.</p>
               <p>"Your next visitor, miss, may not be so gentle as I've been," she added, as she
                  went out.</p>
               <p>"If he is not, I'll tame him," said Elfrida, in the same taunting tone.</p>
               <p>"My heyes! but she's a game un!" said the captain, as he went away with Phone.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER LXXIII.</head>
               <p>Of course, Elfrida had no appetite for the tempting viands which had been placed
                  before her; and she had read enough of the "Mysteries and Mysteries" of the great
                  city, to be placed upon her guard against drugs which would render her helpless;
                  and she refrained from touching either the wine or water which had been placed
                  before her.</p>
               <p>She was glad that the woman had brought a lighted lamp, and left it in the room;
                  for to be there in utter darkness would have added almost intolerable torture to
                  her great misery.</p>
               <p>She had been there, after Phone left, for at least two hours, when she again heard
                  footsteps, rapid and heavy, approaching the door. The key was inserted with some
                  difficulty, evidently by a hand not used to the door; but at last the bolt turned,
                  and the door was opened by a man whose hat was slouched over his eyes, and whose
                  form was completely enveloped in a large cloak, such as was suitable to the
                  inclemency of the season.</p>
               <p>The man—who, by his unsteady step, seemed to be intoxicated—took the key from the
                  outside of the door, and locked the latter inside. Then he turned, and, lifting
                  his hat, disclosed to Elfrida the face of the man who had so pertinaciously
                  followed her home the week before, and who had met with such signal chastisement
                  from the hands of Sam Latrobe. His face was inflamed with the effects of liquor,
                  and his tongue, as well as his unsteady step, betrayed the fact that he had been
                  drinking freely.</p>
               <p>"So, my beauty—Elfy, they call you, I believe—so I've got you caged, have I?" he
                  uttered, as he approached the table near where she sat, and putting the door-key
                  in his pocket, sunk heavily into a chair.</p>
               <p>"I am a prisoner; and if I am indebted to you for being so, must say that, for a
                     <emph>man</emph>, you have played a most dastardly part. You have had one good
                  beating for your insults to me; but, for this wrong, you may lose your life."</p>
               <p>"My life! Why, who'll take it?" said Harry, looking around as if he expected that
                  she had some champion there ready to espouse her cause.</p>
               <p>"Friends who will fearfully avenge any wrong that may be done to me. Do not think
                  that I am friendless, because I am poor!"</p>
               <p>"Poor? You shan't be poor any longer, Elfy, if you are only reasonable. I'm the<pb
                     n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6962-00000051"/> son of the rich Mrs. Mildollar, and can
                  swim in gold."</p>
               <p>"I care not who you are. I despise you and your gold!" said the spirited girl.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you'll get over that by-and-by, and you'll love me as well as I love wine. Is
                  that wine on the table?"</p>
               <p>"I suppose it is," said Elfrida—hoping that he would drink enough of it to render
                  him helpless, so that she could obtain the key, and effect her escape.</p>
               <p>"Then take a glass with me, my dear. I see that there are two glasses here."</p>
               <p>"I would rather drink your heart's blood!" she said, so fiercely, that the coward
                  started back from his chair, lost his equilibrium, and nearly fell to the
                  floor.</p>
               <p>In a moment, however, he recovered his self-possession, and remembering that she
                  was only a weak, defenceless girl, gathered up his shivering manhood into
                  something like composure once more.</p>
               <p>"You've been studying tragedy, I see," said he, after an awkward silence of
                  several minutes.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and am ready to play my part in one!" she responded, bitterly.</p>
               <p>"By Jove, I believe you are!" said the coward, who had totally forgotten the wine
                  in his recent fright. "I'm not exactly well tonight—in fact I'm rather top-heavy
                  with the infernally strong brandy that Phone gave me. So I guess I'll leave you to
                  a day and night of solitary reflection. To-morrow night I shall come; and if you
                  are not more reasonable, I'll find means to make you so! Remember that you are in
                  my power, and nothing on earth can save you. But be kind, and try to love me, and
                  you shall have everything that the heart can desire—rich dresses, fine equipage,
                  servants, and money at will. Think of this and look for me to-morrow night, my
                  dear."</p>
               <p>And Corryell rose to leave, rather sobered by his fright.</p>
               <p>"You had better order your coffin before you come to annoy me again!" said the
                  brave girl.</p>
               <p>"No fear of that necessity, my love; but I'll order a game supper, with plenty of
                  champagne!"</p>
               <p>"You'll find more <emph>real pain</emph> resulting from this unmanly persecution!"
                  said Elfrida.</p>
               <p>He made no reply, but went out and locked the door behind him.</p>
               <p>Elfrida listened until the sound of his footsteps died away, and then the noble
                  courage which had sustained her so far gave way to a feeling of despair and
                  wretchedness; and casting herself down on a sofa, she sobbed and wept as though
                  her heart was breaking. But she was not permitted even to weep without annoyance,
                  for the sharp, taunting voice of Phone was heard outside:</p>
               <p>"I thought you wasn't one of the crying kind?" cried the female fiend.</p>
               <p>"Oh! if there is one spark of womanhood left in you, let me out and let me go
                  home!" pleaded the poor girl.</p>
               <p>"The last spark has been crushed out long ago!" said the woman, with a hoarse
                  laugh. "You may as well make yourself easy where you are—for you'll never leave
                  there until you will feel like staying away from home rather than going
                  there!"</p>
               <p>Elfrida made no reply, but her sobs and tears were checked. Pride and courage
                  again resumed their power, nor did they leave her when she heard the stealthy step
                  of Phone as she went away.</p>
               <p>Fearing that in her thirst she might be tempted to taste the wine or water, and
                  thus be drugged into insensibility, she took them and cast them out of the little
                  window. Then barricading the door inside, so that it could not be opened without
                  awakening her, she knelt down and prayed—as she had ever been wont to do before
                  retiring—and then lay down upon the sofa and composed herself to sleep. For the
                  brave girl was determined to preserve her strength, and still hoped for rescue;
                  for well she knew that the Latrobes would soon discover, by her long absence, that
                  her stay was not voluntary, and would take every means within their power to find
                  her out.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER LXXIV.</head>
               <p>Another night. The elder Tyrconnel having been occupied most of the day in giving
                  his nephew lessons in the so-called "manly art of self-defence"—otherwise, the art
                  of bruising, by which one powerful two-legged brute gets the advantage over the
                  weaker of his kind—and in the use of the single-stick, now sallied out with him to
                  see the "sights of Gotham by night."</p>
               <p>Both were warmly wrapped in thick cloaks; and, through the care of the elder
                  Tyrconnel, both were provided with good stout hickory sticks, which the latter
                  pronounced to be the next thing to black-thorn.</p>
               <p>They sauntered up Broadway—stopping into various saloons to test the quality of
                  the hot whisky-punch concocted therein—until they reached the broad thoroughfare
                  known as Canal street, down which they turned in the direction of the Hudson
                  River.</p>
               <p>Canal street ought to be known as <title>Variety</title> street, I think; for
                  there is not a street in the city which can boast of more variety. There are
                  churches and gambling-hells in it—lottery and policy dens, pawn-broker dens,
                  fortune-tellers, regular and irregular thieves, panel-dens, "rum mills" by the
                  hundred, and yet magnificent stores, valuable manufactories, and genteel
                  residences. Let it be known as the street of "Vast Varieties," and a
                  Canal-streeter be known as a "V. V.," if not an "F. F. V."—as the "old
                  Dominionites" boast of being. But excuse me for stumbling out of the path of my
                  story.</p>
               <p>Tyrconnel and his nephew had not gone far down the street when the sound of a
                  cracked bass voice singing "Rory O'More," to the accompaniment of an ill-tuned
                  piano, attracted their attention. Observing by the sign and lights that the sound
                  came from a saloon, the jovial peer insisted on going in and seeing what could be
                  seen and hearing what could be heard.</p>
               <p>They entered a large room in the second story of the building, which was fitted up
                  with a small but elegant bar, adorned about the walls with a profusion of French
                  prints, bordering closely upon obscenity, and furnished with "any quantity" of
                  comfortable chairs, sofas, and small tables, many of which were occupied by
                  foppishly-dressed young men, engaged in smoking and drinking. The liquor and
                  cigars, when called for, were supplied from the bar—where a tall, showy-looking
                  woman our acquaintance, "Phone," presided—by about a half-dozen of
                  fancifully-dressed, attractive girls, whose bare arms and shoulders, as well as
                  their highly-colored cheeks, were prominent features to the observer.</p>
               <p>At one end of the room, elevated upon a low platform, was the "music"—consisting
                  of the ill-tuned, or rather <emph>untuned</emph> piano aforementioned, and the
                  "professor," a very seedy-looking gentleman, whose red nose and inflamed eyes were
                  indications of their owner's fondness for "blue-ruin."</p>
               <p>Having finished his song, he was going up to the bar to get his reward in a glass
                  of rum, when Tyrconnel and his nephew entered.</p>
               <p>The latter took seats at a vacant table, and were immediately called upon by one
                  of the waiteresses of the establishment, who, with her sweetest smile, asked what
                  the gentlemen would be pleased to have.</p>
               <p>"Two whisky-punches, my dear; and don't make them too swate by looking into them!"
                  said the elder Tyrconnel, in his usual droll way.</p>
               <p>He did not notice that a heavily-whiskered man, who was sitting near, started from
                  his seat as if a knife had pierced his vitals at the sound of his voice. But such
                  was the case; and the man was Barrington, who had instantly recognized him.</p>
               <p>"Phone," said he, in a hoarse whisper, as he leaned over the bar, "Phone, we're
                  done hup and ruined! That tallest man who has just come hin, is one of the chaps
                  that I got Bill Tubbs to carry hover the water. He's tracked me 'ere, and I'm a
                  goner!"</p>
               <p>"Be easy, you fool—he has not recognized you—you don't look any more as you used
                  to than a donkey looks like a horse! Keep out of his way, and he'll not know you,
                  but drink his liquor and go away. Take a drink and keep shady. I'll drop over
                  there and sound him directly."</p>
               <p>Barrington drank a glass of liquor, and then slunk away into a dark corner of the
                  room.</p>
               <p>In a few moments, the "widow," as she was called, having beckoned one of the girls
                  into the bar to take her place, walked out into the saloon (exchanging a word here
                  and there with her customers), until she approached the table where Tyrconnel
                  sat.</p>
               <p>"How does your punch suit you, gentlemen?" she asked, with one of her most
                  fascinating smiles.</p>
               <p>"It is capital, madam—capital; like the first letter in the name of Cain's
                  brother! Won't you take a glass with us?" replied Tyrconnel, the elder.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir; as you are a new patron, I shall feel proud to do so," replied
                  Phone, taking a seat, and giving one of the girls an order to bring her a glass of
                  punch.</p>
               <p>But she was not destined to enjoy that glass of punch; for there was heard,
                  suddenly, a shriek, or cry of pain, as if from a man in mortal agony; and, the
                  next instant, a young and incomparably lovely girl rushed into the room, with
                  disheveled hair, and a face indicative of extreme terror. In one hand she held a
                  small knife; and both the hand and weapon were red with blood.</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, save me, protect me, if you are a man!" cried the poor girl, as a man,
                  who was also bleeding, rushed in after her; and she sprung to the side of
                  Tyrconnel for protection.</p>
               <p>"By my sowl! I'll protect you as long as there's a drop of blood in my veins,"
                  said Tyrconnel; and both he and his nephew started to their feet—throwing aside
                  their cloaks, and grasping their stout canes.</p>
               <p>"Secure that girl; she has tried to murder me!" cried the man, who had followed
                  her into the room.</p>
               <p>"And pity it is that she hadn't, Master Harry Corryell, you miserable thafe of the
                  world!" cried Tyrconnel, instantly recognizing him.</p>
               <p>"Great Heavens! Lord Tyrconnel alive, and here!" cried the villain, thunderstruck
                  by his appearance.</p>
               <p>"Alive he must never leave 'ere, or we're both done for!" cried Barrington, as he
                  rushed forward with a heavy decanter, and aimed a blow at Tyrconnel's head.</p>
               <p>But the latter dodged it, and the dangerous missile came crashing down upon the
                  head of Phone, who stood in the way; and just as she fell senseless to the floor,
                  the cane of the younger Tyrconnel came down with crushing force on the skull of
                  Barrington, who dropped like an ox felled in a butcher's stall.</p>
               <p>Of course, a terrible confusion reigned. The girls screamed and yelled; there was
                  a stampede among the more cowardly of the customers; while others would have sided
                  with the widow, had not the cry of "Police! <emph>police!</emph>" been heard.</p>
               <p>In a moment, a rush upon the stairs told that the police were coming; and
                     Tyrconnel<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6962-00000052"/> was delighted to see his
                  friends, Watson and Andros, accompanying a couple of officers who rushed in.</p>
               <p>The next instant, Elfrida sprung from the side of her protector, and, with a glad
                  cry, threw herself into the arms of a stout man who came with the party, and, as
                  she did so, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"O Sam—good, noble Sam!—I knew you would look after me."</p>
               <p>"To be sure I would, dear Elfy! But here are others that have been looking after
                  you—one who has a better right than I have," said honest Sam Latrobe.</p>
               <p>"A <emph>better</emph> right?" asked the girl, in wonder.</p>
               <p>"Yes; for he is your father!" said Sam, pointing to Andros. "There, sir, is your
                  Elfrida," he added to the latter.</p>
               <p>"I never had a father or mother—at least, to know them," said Elfrida, sadly, as
                  she looked doubtfully at Andros, in whose dark eyes tears were glittering.</p>
               <p>"Dear child, your sainted mother is in heaven; but I will prove that a father,
                  though long neglectful, can yet be kind," said Andros. And his earnest tones, his
                  tears, the words of her honest friend, and the intuitive feeling of her own heart,
                  told the sweet girl that he was indeed her parent.</p>
               <p>And she threw herself, sobbing with joy, upon his breast.</p>
               <p>"This is no place for explanation; let us have carriages called, and all repair to
                  the hotel," said the doctor.</p>
               <p>"First, let that young rascal Corryell be secured," said Tyrconnel.</p>
               <p>"He here?" asked Watson, in surprise.</p>
               <p>"To be sure: it was from him we rescued the young lady. But where the divil is the
                  son of perdition? He's cut and run, sure, though I thought he was blading to
                  death; for she'd been practicing phlebotomy on him."</p>
               <p>Search was made in vain for Corryell. He had escaped in the confusion, though
                  probably very badly hurt; for Elfrida stated that she had struck him with her
                  small knife several times, as hard as she could, to save herself from his
                  violence. And the traces of blood, as well as her escape from the terrible wrong
                  which he intended, showed that her blows had been heavy and effectual.</p>
               <p>The persons of Phone and Barrington—both of whom were well known to the
                  police—were now easily secured; for both were dangerously injured by the blows
                  which they had received, and had to be removed to prison under the care of a
                  surgeon.</p>
               <p>Andros and Elfrida, accompanied by Sam, started for the hotel, intending to call
                  at the house on Laight street, and let Susy and her mother know that Elfy had been
                  found; while Watson and the Tyrconnels waited for the officers to rejoin them,
                  after having left their prisoners in security—intending to secure Mrs. Mildollar
                  and her son at once, before they could escape.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER LXXV.</head>
               <p>When Watson and his friends, with the officers, reached the house of Mrs.
                  Mildollar, they found that they were already too late—though the house in
                  confusion, and the servants in alarm, told that the fugitives from justice had not
                  long been gone.</p>
               <p>All that they could gather from the servants was, that young Corryell had been
                  brought home in a carriage, dangerously wounded; and that, after a brief private
                  interview with his mother, she had ordered a carriage, and hurried away with
                  him.</p>
               <p>An examination of her chamber showed that she had probably fled with what ready
                  money she had, and her jewels—for everything there was in confusion, but neither
                  money nor jewels could be found.</p>
               <p>Leaving an officer in charge of the house, the doctor and his friends returned to
                  the hotel to rejoice with Andros, in the safe recovery of his lovely, noble
                  child.</p>
               <p>And now, reader, comes the most pleasant part of this story to me—its CONCLUSION,
                  which I will sum up in as few words as possible; for its incidents though many,
                  and interesting, can be condensed better than dwelt upon. Young Dennis Tyrconnel
                  had lost his heart the moment that he saw Elfrida; and after due acquaintance and
                  consideration, Elfrida, with that generosity peculiar to women who, with all their
                  faults, have some angel-nature about them—took pity on him, and gave him her heart
                  to fill the vacancy in his bosom.</p>
               <p>But this was not done until she was fully installed in the possession of the
                  Mildollar estate; for the original will had still been kept by Barrington, who
                  gave it up on condition of being permitted, with Phone, to leave the country. Mrs.
                  Mildollar, probably terrified at the prospect of punishment, must have fled the
                  country, for neither she nor her son were ever heard of afterward.</p>
               <p>Sam Latrobe was richly rewarded by Andros for his noble-hearted conduct; and the
                  latter, after his daughter's marriage, accompanied the Tyrconnels to Ireland—where
                  he yet dwells, a reformed man and a happy grandfather.</p>
               <p>The following letter, received not very long after the arrival of the happy party
                  in Ireland, by Doctor Watson, must close this long, truthful, and (I hope) not
                  entirely uninteresting story.</p>

                           <p>"DOCTOR DEAR: We're safe in ould Emerald Hall—blessed be the Lord and
                              all his saints! When we went through London, I stopped to make
                              inquiries about Captain Bill Tubbs, and it is my opinion that he is
                              still captain aboord his own ship, for he has never been heard from
                              since he sailed. But while I was in London, I found a long-lost jewel,
                              that I'm wearing in my bosom now, and shall till my bones are under
                              the turf. And knowing t'will bother you to guess what it is, I make
                              bould to explain. You remember poor Faralie, the pretty French girl,
                              that I thought had nagur blood in her veins—divil the drop of it,
                              though!—well, the poor thing lived in London, and watched and mourned
                              for me, for she would not give up that I was dead, until she saw my
                              name registered and announced in the papers. And then she came to
                              Meyert's, to see me, and I thought she would have died for joy. And
                              seeing that she felt so glad to see me, I thought it would be wrong to
                              let her ever be sorrowful again, so I made her Lady Tyrconnel; and she
                              is the happiest little body that ever lived, excepting sweet 'Elfy,'
                              who runs neck and neck with her on the turnpike of felicity.</p>
                           <p>"Jones is with me yet, and has not only forgotten Brown, but has
                              consoled himself for the loss of Mrs. Jones, by taking one Biddy
                              Connolly to his bosom; and he intends very soon to go back to New
                              York, for he says that the climate of Europe is too foggy for him.</p>
                           <p>"I've no other news to tell you, only that Captain Barrington went out
                              of the world dancing, the other day—having air for a platform to dance
                              on, and a snug cravat of hemp about his neck, to help him hold his
                              head up.</p>
                           <p>"His partner in iniquity, 'Phone,' was tried for the same crime: asing
                              a gentleman of his life and his money at the same time—but being a
                              woman, and good-looking, the jury were inclined to mercy, and she got
                              off with transportation for life.</p>
                           <p>"Have you heard a word about the ould sinner, Mildollar, yet? What a
                              pity it is, we coldn't have given her a life-lease of the Island of
                              Lookoheva! Are you still in a state of single-wretchedness, doctor
                              dear? If so, get out of it as soon as you can. Matrimony is a blessed
                              institution—especially when you think so. All of us send our love to
                              you, and wish you long life, and joy while it lasts.</p>
