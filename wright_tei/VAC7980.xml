FIELD OF TERJL{OR.&#xD;
9&#xD;
AT the foot of the Giant Mountain, (so called from&#xD;
its pre-eminent height,) in a fertile district of Sue-&#xD;
sia, there fell to be divided among several relations&#xD;
the J)roperty of a rich commoner, who had died&#xD;
- without children, and whose various farms were scat-&#xD;
tered about, in different quarters of this romantic&#xD;
country.&#xD;
For this purpose, they had assembled in a small&#xD;
Hin, of the head village, and would very soon have&#xD;
epine to an amie~able agreement, on the division of&#xD;
their inheritance, had it not been that it included&#xD;
one farm, called the ,field of terror; which, of course,&#xD;
no one was inclined to receive for his portion.&#xD;
Yet the surface of this field was adorned with&#xD;
blooming flowers, anrl a variety of wild shrubs and&#xD;
underwood, betokening at once, the fertility of the&#xD;
soil, and the neglect of the husbandman. Man~r&#xD;
years indeed had passed since any one had ventured&#xD;
there with a plough, nor had any seeds been planted&#xD;
or sown, but those which nature herself supplied.&#xD;
Or if some bold adventurer had now and then made&#xD;
such an attempt, the work-oxen were invariably&#xD;
seized with an uncontrollable fury ;-even the plough..&#xD;
man and sower fled in wild aifright, complaining&#xD;
that horrible spectres floated around them, pretend-&#xD;

~VIio ~heddd ww take this accursed and ominous&#xD;
ikbl into I~i~' allotment, became the grand question&#xD;
in debate. To every one it appeared, (according to&#xD;
the usual way ot the world,) that, what to himself&#xD;
was, even in idea, insupportable, might, by his&#xD;
neighbour, be encountered without risk or hesita-&#xD;
tion. 71'hus they continued disputing till a late hour&#xD;
of the evening.-At last, after an interval of silence,&#xD;
one of the party announced the following sugges-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"We are," said he, accordingg to the injunctions&#xD;
of our predecessor, oblige d% make some provision&#xD;
for a poor cousin, who lives here in this village. To&#xD;
us the girl is but very distantly related-besides, she&#xD;
will 1)robably soon have a good husband to protect&#xD;
her, for she is amiable and prudent, and is commonly&#xD;
called the beautiful Sabina. Therefore, my coun-&#xD;
sel is, that w~ freely give to our cousin, in a present,&#xD;
this field of terror. We shall then have at once ful-&#xD;
filled our duty, and sup~iied a dowry for Sabina;&#xD;
which, unpromising as it appears at present, may&#xD;
yet p rove no inconsiderable fortune, if her husband&#xD;
should chance to be sufficiently skilful and cou-&#xD;
rageous to venture on its improvement." '~h~ rest&#xD;
of the party unanimously approved of this Mo~mon,&#xD;
and one of their number was immediately despatch-&#xD;
ed on an embassy, to acquaint Sabina with their de-&#xD;
termination.&#xD;
Before this debate was at an end, Sabina had, in&#xD;
the dusk of the evening, heard a light knocking at&#xD;
the door.-To her question of "who is there ?" an&#xD;
answer was returned, which induced her immnedi-&#xD;
ately to rise from her seat, open the lattice, and look&#xD;
out. It was the well remembered, and long wished&#xD;
for voice of Conrad; a young man, like herself,&#xD;
handsome and amiaUe, but also extremely poor; on&#xD;
which account he had left the village, about tw~&#xD;

THE FIELD OF TERROR.&#xD;
years before, as a soldier, in hopes of returning with&#xD;
such a portion of worldly gain, as might render&#xD;
practicable a marriage with the beloved mistress,&#xD;
whose affections he had already won.&#xD;
Pleasant and affecting was it now~ to behold, how&#xD;
the tall and graceful young soldier, ~* ith jo~jrful coun-&#xD;
tenance, proffered his faithful right hand to Sabina,&#xD;
while her bright and beautiful eyes, glistening with&#xD;
tears, beamed through the changeless verdure of ivy&#xD;
boughs, on her changeless lover!&#xD;
"Ah, Conrad !" said she, deeply blushing, "Hea-&#xD;
ven be praised that your life has been preserved ;-&#xD;
for this alone, I prayed in your long absence; nor do&#xD;
I now require any other boon of fortune.~-." Her&#xD;
golden gifts, indeed," said Conrad, smiling and&#xD;
shaking his head, "have come but sparingly-yet, at&#xD;
least, I have returned richer than I went; and if my&#xD;
dear Sabina has but courage, I think we might now&#xD;
venture on maria e, and honourably brave the&#xD;
world."-" Ah, ~ ful Conrad !" sighed his mis-&#xD;
tress, "to link thy fate unalterably thus, for weal&#xD;
and wo, with a poor helpless orphan !"-" Dearest&#xD;
girl," interrupted the soldier-" if thou loves me,&#xD;
say but yes, and rest assured, that all will go well-.&#xD;
we ~j?1all live together, happier, indeed, than king&#xD;
and queen !"-" But," said Sabina, "are you then&#xD;
free-no longer a soldier ?"-Conrad, without speak-&#xD;
ing, now searched in a leather purse, which contain-&#xD;
ed his little fortune, for a silver medal, which he&#xD;
handed to Sabina, who held it so that* the light of&#xD;
her lamp fell on the device. With old-fashioned&#xD;
wit, a broken drum was there represented, and Sa-&#xD;
bina began to read the motto-" Thank heaven war&#xD;
has"-" Thank heaven war has an end,* it ~should&#xD;
say," added Conrad,-" it is true, indeed, that&#xD;

will probably have good results; and meanwhile, our&#xD;
general has disbanded his troops."&#xD;
With joyful anticipations, Sabina now gave her&#xD;
hand to her lover; then opened the cottage door, and&#xD;
allowed him, as her accepted bridegroom, to enter&#xD;
the small apartment, where he set down beside his&#xD;
mistress, and related how he had gained a small suni&#xD;
in gold and silver, from an Italian officer, whom he&#xD;
had hpnourably conquered in the field; and who, by&#xD;
the surrender of this treasure, had ransQmed his life.&#xD;
2rurning her wheel industriously, and smiling&#xD;
softly, at intervals, on her brave lover, Sabina con-&#xD;
gratulated herself, that neither to her own, or to&#xD;
Conrad's future gains, the slightest imputation of in-&#xD;
justice or violence could be attached.&#xD;
During this conversation, her cousin made his&#xD;
appearance, to deliver his embassy. Sabina, with&#xD;
modest blushes, introduced to him Conrad, as her&#xD;
accepted lover, just returned from an honourable~&#xD;
campaign. "Ha, then," said her new guest, "I&#xD;
have luckily come in the veI~y nick ~pf time; for if&#xD;
by chance, your bridegroom has returned from the&#xD;
wars without much worldly gain, the dowry, with&#xD;
which, by authority of your other cousins, I am now&#xD;
to present you, will no doubt be very welcome to&#xD;
him." Conrad, on the contrary, was of a spirit too&#xD;
proud and independent, and besides, was too much&#xD;
of a romantic lover, to express any sort of exultation&#xD;
on hearing this address. The humble Sabina, how-&#xD;
ever, as yet unconscious of what her cousins really&#xD;
intended, seemed to acknowledge, on this occasion,&#xD;
the special favot~r of Providence, and cast down her&#xD;
eyes, with soft smiles of gladness and gratitude. But&#xD;
when she now heard that, her whole portion was to&#xD;
be the field of terror, then the selfish avarice of her&#xD;
cousins struck at once with icy coldness, on her&#xD;
heart, and she could no longer restrain the starting&#xD;
tears of disappointment. Her cousin looked at her&#xD;
with scornful smiles, pretending to regret that she&#xD;
should have reckoned on any better share of the in&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FIELD OF TERROR.&#xD;
&#xD;
heritance, this being a much larger portion than,&#xD;
from the degree of her relationship, she was entitled&#xD;
to receive.&#xD;
Upon this, he wished immediately to retire. Con-&#xD;
rad, hoxvever~ intercepted his retreat, and, with a&#xD;
cold composure, which often accompanied his great-&#xD;
est indignation, he thus. addressed him: "Sir, I per-&#xD;
ceive that the good intentions of the deceased, tomy&#xD;
betrothed wife, you and your companions have&#xD;
chosen to make a jest, and that you are altogether&#xD;
resolved that not' one farthing shall accrue to her&#xD;
from your inheritance~ Yet we now take, in God's&#xD;
name, your, allotment, hoping that this Field of Ter-&#xD;
ror, which, in the hands of envious and avaricious pol-&#xD;
troons, might have remained barren, may, unJer the&#xD;
management of a brave soldier, prove of more worth&#xD;
than you suppose."&#xD;
Sabina's cousin, terrified by Conrad's martial ap-&#xD;
pearance, turned pale, and did not venture on any&#xD;
reply. On his departure, the young soldier kissed&#xD;
the tears from the beautiful eyes of his bride, and&#xD;
hastened with her to a neighboring priest, to ~light&#xD;
before him their mutual troth, and appoint their&#xD;
wedding-day.&#xD;
Within a few weeks after this, Conrad and Sabi-&#xD;
ima were married, and began to arrange their small&#xD;
household. The young man had spent almost all&#xD;
his gold and silver in the purchase of two fine oxen,&#xD;
a plough, seed corn, and household furniture. The&#xD;
remainder was just sufficient to guard, with pru-&#xD;
dence and frugality, against the privations of pover-&#xD;
ty, until the next harvest season. However, when&#xD;
Conrad first went out with his plough and oxen, to&#xD;
labour, he looked back, laughing, to Sabina, and&#xD;
promised her that the gold which he was now to&#xD;
trust in the ground would not pr6ve deceitful, and&#xD;
that by another year, they would be far richer. Sa-&#xD;
bina looked after him anxiously, and wished only to&#xD;
~ee him safely returned from the Field of Terror.&#xD;
Conrad, indeed, returned earlier than she had ex&#xD;

&#xD;
pected, but in a mood of mind by no means so tranquil&#xD;
as that in which he set out. He dragged behind&#xD;
him his plough, broken in pieces, and laboriously&#xD;
goaded along one of his oxen, severely wotxnded,&#xD;
while he himself also, was bleeding in the shoulder&#xD;
and head. Yet, after all, he strove to look cheerful&#xD;
and unconcerned; and, with the unconquerable&#xD;
spirit of a brave soldier, tried to console the weeping&#xD;
Sabina. "Now," said he, "you ~)vill have enough&#xD;
to do! Salting, pickling, and cookery! The gob~&#xD;
lins on the Field. of Terror have provided us with&#xD;
beef enough for a whole season. This poor .animal&#xD;
has, in his madness, hurt himself so much as to be&#xD;
quite useless, and, (at least as long as he lives,) in.&#xD;
curable. His comrade has run furiously down the&#xD;
mountain. I saw him fall into the torrent below,&#xD;
from whence he will never be recovered."&#xD;
"My cousins! Oh, my wicked cousins!" cried&#xD;
Sabina: "Now has their perfidious gift robbed us of&#xD;
all your hard-won earnings; and above all, dear&#xD;
Conrad, you are yourself dangerously wounded."&#xD;
"As to my wounds, they are nothing," replied her&#xD;
husband; "the pair of oxen, no doubt, got me once&#xD;
between them, when their fury was at its full height&#xD;
and I was resolved not to let them go. But all this,&#xD;
heaven be praised, I have got well over; and to-mor~&#xD;
row morning, I shall make another attempt on the&#xD;
Field of Terror."&#xD;
Sabina now tried, by every method in her power,&#xD;
to dissuade him from this resolve' but he said firm~&#xD;
ly, that the field, so long as he lived, should not t~e&#xD;
suffered to remain unprofitable; where a man could&#xD;
not plough, he must dig; and the goblin would now&#xD;
no longer have to deal with timid irrational animals,&#xD;
but with a steady and experienced soldier, who&#xD;
scorned to run, even from the devil himself. In the&#xD;
course of that day, he had a butcher to kill and cut&#xD;
up the poor wounded beast; and next morning,&#xD;
while Sabina had betaken herself to her new em&#xD;
~)loyment of pickling and salting, Conrad had pro-&#xD;

&#xD;
needed again upon his way, scarcely less contented&#xD;
now, when he had but a pickaxe and spade, than&#xD;
on the preceding day, when he set out in style, with&#xD;
a plough and team of oxen.&#xD;
On this occasion, it was somewhat late in the&#xD;
evening before he returned: he was fatigued, and&#xD;
even looked pale, yet he was more cheerful, and&#xD;
soon tranquilized his timid and anxious i~ife.&#xD;
"This kind of husbandry," said he, "is rather tire~&#xD;
some, no doubt; bes'rdes, there is a strange ghostly&#xD;
*   looking figure, that starts up, now on one side, and&#xD;
now on another, mocks at my labour, and interrupts&#xD;
me both by gestures and words. HQwever, he&#xD;
seems even himself to wonder that I take so little&#xD;
notice of him; and upon this I gain always new&#xD;
*   courage, which, indeed, never can be wanting to an&#xD;
honest man, who is only desirous peaceably to follow&#xD;
out his own proper avocation."&#xD;
In this manner, many days and weeks were spent..&#xD;
The resolute Conrad persevered undauntedly in the&#xD;
labour of leveling the ground and rooting out the&#xD;
weed~, digging and sowing in the most favourable&#xD;
situations. It is true, indeed, that with the spade&#xD;
alone, he was able to cultivate but a very small part&#xD;
of the field; however, he redoubled, on this account,&#xD;
his care and attention; and, at length, had the satis~&#xD;
faction to see a harvest springing up, which, if not&#xD;
very rich, yet promised, and made good, a profit fully&#xD;
equal to his expectations. He was obliged, how-&#xD;
ever, to get through the toil of reaping and leading&#xD;
home as well as he could, without the assistance of&#xD;
any friend or servant. No day laborers would, for&#xD;
any temptation of wages, venture on the Field of&#xD;
Terror' and as to Sabina, her husband would not&#xD;
suffer her to go thither, more especially as he had&#xD;
reason to think that he would soon become a father.&#xD;
The child accordingly was born, and in the third&#xD;
year after their marriage, was followed by another,&#xD;
while, in other respects, no material change had&#xD;
yet taken place in Conrad's situation. By courage&#xD;

&#xD;
and exertion, he knew how to gain harvest upon&#xD;
harvest from the field; and thus fulfilled his assur~&#xD;
ance to Sabina, that in their married state they&#xD;
wQuld honourably brave the world.&#xD;
One autumnal evening, when the deep shades of&#xD;
darkness had already fallen around him, Conrad. as&#xD;
usual, (his harvest having been reaped and cleared&#xD;
away) plied industriously his labour with the spade.&#xD;
Suddenly there arose opposite to him the figure of a&#xD;
tall muscular man, black and swarthy like a collier:,&#xD;
with a long iron bar or poker in his hands who said&#xD;
to him-" Is there not then one pair of oxen to be&#xD;
had in this country, that you labour with both hands&#xD;
in this manner? Yet to judge by the extent of your&#xD;
grounds, you should be a rich farmer !"-Conrad&#xD;
knew very well who it was that spoke to him, and&#xD;
l)crSevered in his usual way-that is, he kept silence,&#xD;
turned his eyes and thoughts as much as possible&#xD;
from the goblin, and plied at his task more assiduous-&#xD;
ly than before. But the collier did not, in his usual&#xD;
manner, vanish away, in order to return in a fort-n&#xD;
more hideous and distracting; but, on the contrary,&#xD;
stood still, and said, in a friendly tone-" Conrad,&#xD;
you do great injustice, not only to mebut to yourself.&#xD;
Answer me with truth and confidence. Perhaps I&#xD;
could point out a remedy for all your evils."-" Well&#xD;
in God's name," said Conrad, "if by your words&#xD;
you deceive me~ the guilt is yours,: and not mine !"&#xD;
Then he began, without further hesitation, to relate&#xD;
accurately and truly, all that had befallen him, since&#xD;
his possession of that' field; nor did he in the least&#xD;
conceal his indignation at the Hobgoblin, who, by&#xD;
his perpetual interruptions, had rendered it so diffi -&#xD;
cult fo. him, with~the assistance of only a pickaxe&#xD;
and spade, to raise a sufficient harvest for the bare&#xD;
maintenance of himself and his family.&#xD;
The collier listened to him seriouslyand atten-.&#xD;
tively; then, after some reflection, replied as follows:&#xD;
"I think, friend, you already know very well who I&#xD;
am; and it argues no little courage on your part, not&#xD;
10&#xD;
&#xD;
I-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
to have abated one jot of your honour, as a soldier,&#xD;
but truly and openly to have expressed how&#xD;
much you are dissatisfied with me. To tell the&#xD;
truth, you have had reason enough to be angry; but&#xD;
as I have proved ~rou to be a brave fellow, I shall&#xD;
now make a proposal, which may do you no little&#xD;
service. Now listen: There are times when, after&#xD;
I have, in wood, field, and mountain, played the&#xD;
- fool, and terrified the people to my heart's content,&#xD;
there has risen within me, a sincere and ardent de-.&#xD;
sire of entering in to the family of some honest house-&#xD;
holder, and living there regularly and peaceably for&#xD;
one half year. Now then, what if you should hire&#xD;
me for this half year as your servant?"-" It is base&#xD;
and wicked in thee," said Conrad, "thus to mock at&#xD;
an honest man, who has, at thine own request, given&#xD;
thee his confidenc~."-" Nay, nay," sai(l the other,&#xD;
"there is no mockery-I am quite serious. You&#xD;
shall find an honest labourer in me; and so long as I&#xD;
* remain in your service, not one phantom will appear&#xD;
on the Field of Terror, so that you may bring a&#xD;
whole herd of oxen thither, without apprehension."&#xD;
/ .-" That, indeed, would be something," said Con-&#xD;
rad, meditating; "If I only knew that thou wouldst&#xD;
keep thy promise; and especially, whether I, as a&#xD;
Christian, may venture to deal with thee !"-" As&#xD;
for the last point, you must ju(lge for yourself," said&#xD;
the goblin, "but my promise I have never yet brok-&#xD;
en, and never shall, as long as the Giant Mountain&#xD;
stands; neither am I by nature very wicked-some-&#xD;
what wild and sportive, it is true-but that is all."-&#xD;
- -  "I believe, indeed," said Conrad, "that thou art&#xD;
the well known Rubezahl."-" Listen," said the&#xD;
stranger, somewhat angrily, "If you belive this,&#xD;
know also, that the powerful genius of this land can-&#xD;
not endure to be called by that pitiful name, but&#xD;
chooses to be styled the Lord of the Mountain !"&#xD;

Conrad. "You may call me Waldmann,* then,"&#xD;
said the collier. Conrad looked steadfa4ly at him&#xD;
for some time, and at last answered-" Good! It&#xD;
shall be so!-Methinks I shall do no wrong in ac-&#xD;
cepting thine offer. I have often seen that people&#xD;
take dogs for turnspits, and use other irrational ani~&#xD;
mals about a household-why not then a goblin ?"-~&#xD;
At this the collier laughed heartily, and said,-&#xD;
"XVelI! this is certainly the first time that such&#xD;
conditions were ever made with one of my rank; but&#xD;
even for this very reason, and for the sake of variety,&#xD;
I like it the better. So then, dear master, your hand&#xD;
on the bargain! Conrad, however, insisted on some&#xD;
special conditions; first, that his new servant should&#xD;
never make it known .to Sabina, or the children,&#xD;
that he had any connexion with the Field of Terror,&#xD;
and still less, that he had come from the hideous&#xD;
gloomy caverns of the Giant Mountain; secondly,&#xD;
that within the limits of his master's house and gar-&#xD;
den, no sort of diable~'ie should ever be exhibited;&#xD;
and as Waldmann very readily agreed to all this,&#xD;
the bargain was forthwith concluded, and they ~vent&#xD;
home amicably together.&#xD;
Sabina was not a little surprised at this addition&#xD;
to her household, and entertained considerable feel-&#xD;
ings of terror at the gigantic swarthy figure of the&#xD;
new servant. The children also, would not, for&#xD;
some time venture out of doors, if he were at work&#xD;
in the garden or farm yard. However, by his quiet,&#xD;
regular, and industrious conduct, Waldmann soon&#xD;
gained the good opinion of every one; or if at any&#xD;
time, in a foolish fit of merriment, he began to hunt&#xD;
about with the dogs, or play tricks on the poultry, it&#xD;
was found to be more in jest than really mischievouS~.&#xD;
Even then, a single look from his master, was suffi.&#xD;
cient to bring him again within his accustomed anJ&#xD;
prudential limits.&#xD;
Confiding in the promise of the mountain spirit~&#xD;

&#xD;
Conrad had again boldly ventured on the purchase&#xD;
of a yoke of oxen; and with his plough newly re-&#xD;
paired, went once more merrily to the field. Sabi~&#xD;
na looked after him apprehensively, and yct ixtore&#xD;
anxiously waited in the evening for his return, fear-&#xD;
ing that he would at last come home, not only with&#xD;
disappointed hopes, but more dangerously wounded&#xD;
than before. Singing, however, and driving his&#xD;
tractable fine oxen before him, Conrad marched,&#xD;
while the first evening bell was ringing, through the&#xD;
village. In high glee, he kissed his wife and chil-&#xD;
dren, and even shook his black servant heartily by&#xD;
the hand.&#xD;
Many times also, did Waldmann lead out and&#xD;
bring home the work-oxen, in this manner, while&#xD;
Conrad, in his turn, staid at home and labored in&#xD;
the farm yard or garden. A large portion of the&#xD;
Field of Terror, was ere long ploughed up, and all&#xD;
went on prosperously, to the astonishment of the&#xD;
villagers, and envious displeasure of Sabina's ava-&#xD;
ricious cousins. Conrad, however, often thought to&#xD;
himself, '~ This is all but for a short time; and how&#xD;
the harvest is to be leaped and brought home, Hea-&#xD;
ven knows! Long before that season, Waldman's&#xD;
servitude will be at an end, and the goblins on the&#xD;
Field of Terror, may be more troublesoihe than&#xD;
ever. Yet a labour of this kind," added he, "will,&#xD;
of itself, strengthen both heart and hand, and per-&#xD;
haps Waldmann, as he has indeed, frequently, in his&#xD;
mirthful moments hinted, will, for the sake of old&#xD;
friendship, restrain himself, till the field is cleared&#xD;
of this one harvest at least."&#xD;
The winter had now arrived; the labour on the&#xD;
Field of Terror was ended; and Conrad industri-&#xD;
ously plied with his oxen, at the necessary task of&#xD;
bringing home wood for the stove and kitchen&#xD;
hearth. About this time, it happened, one day, that&#xD;
Sabina was called to a poor widow, in the village,&#xD;
who had fallen sick of a fever, and whom she was in&#xD;
the habit of assisting sedulously, so far as her newly&#xD;

am~endqd circumstances would allow. Only she was&#xD;
now puzzled, in her husband's absence, how to dis-&#xD;
pose of the children; Waldmann, however, entreat-&#xD;
ed that she would give them in charge to him; and&#xD;
as the little ones were accustomed to his stories, and&#xD;
were willing to remain with him, Sabina at last&#xD;
- agreed, and 'without farther hesitation, cheerfully&#xD;
went on her charitable errand.&#xD;
About an hour afterwards, Conrad returned from&#xD;
the forest. He drew the wood-cart into the shed,&#xD;
put his oxen into the stable, and then went merrily&#xD;
home, to warm his stiffened limbs at the comfortable&#xD;
kitchen fire. Suddenly he heard the voices of his&#xD;
children, painfully weeping-instantly he started up,&#xD;
burst open the door of the parlour, and found the&#xD;
crouching together, under the stove, screaming wil&#xD;
terror, and Waldmann jumping, meanwhile, makin~~&#xD;
hideous grimaces, with a coronet of living fire on&#xD;
his dishevelled and staring hair.,&#xD;
"What the devil is all this?" said Conrad, in&#xD;
great indignation-when, in a moment, the porten-&#xD;
tious ornament on Waldman's head was extinguish-&#xD;
ed; he stood humbly and in silence, till at last he&#xD;
tried to excuse himself, by saying he had only made&#xD;
game for the children. The little ones, however,&#xD;
came still crouching and complaining to their father,&#xD;
and told him how Waldmapn had at first terrified&#xD;
them with wild stories, and~ afterwards appeared to&#xD;
them wearing a sheep's head at one time, and a&#xD;
dog's head at another. "enough-Enough !" inter-&#xD;
rupted Conrad, "get thee gone fellow ! We don't&#xD;
remain another hour under the same roof together !"&#xD;
With these words he seized Waldmann, thrust him&#xD;
out of doors, even as far as the outer garden gate.&#xD;
Meanwhile he commanded the children to remain&#xD;
quiet in the parlour;-their father was now return-&#xD;
ed, and they felt secure against every danger.&#xD;
The mysterious servant, at first bore all this with-&#xD;
out a word; however, when he stood alone with Con-&#xD;
:ad, amid the wintry landscape, he sa~it)laughing.&#xD;

"Listen, Master! methinks we must again be re-&#xD;
conciled to one another; I have indeed played a&#xD;
('oolish trick, but shall never be guilty in like man-&#xD;
ner again. It was only one offence-you must over-&#xD;
look it." "Even in this very way," said Conrad,&#xD;
"the same humour might seize thee again, and thou&#xD;
wouldst easily terrify my children to madness. Our&#xD;
contract, therefore, is at an end." "My half-.year&#xD;
is not at, an end," said Waldmann, in defiance,&#xD;
"therefore I shall return into thy house." Not a&#xD;
step-not even to the threshold," said Conrad,&#xD;
"thou hast irrevocably broken our bargain, by thy&#xD;
cursed hobgoblinry. All that I can do for thee is to&#xD;
pay thy full wages.-There it is, and get thee gone."&#xD;
"Full wages!" said the spirit, laughing in scorn,&#xD;
"knowest thou not my inexhaustible treasures in&#xD;
the caverns of the mountain?" "It is not for thy&#xD;
sake, but for my own, that I pay thee," sai(l Conrad,&#xD;
"for I am resolved not to remain in. debt, either to&#xD;
man or devil." XVith these words, he thrust the&#xD;
money with violence into Waldmann's pocket.&#xD;
"What shall now become of the Field of Terror?"&#xD;
said the demon, half angrily. "'Whatever -God&#xD;
pleases!" said Conrad. "Sixteen Fields of Terror&#xD;
were to me nothing, when weighed against one hair&#xD;
on the head of either of my children. Therefore,&#xD;
begone, I say, unless you first wish to receive a&#xD;
hearty beating, that you will remember !" "Softly !'~&#xD;
said the spirit, "'When a being of my class assumes&#xD;
the form of a man, he never fails to choose a stout&#xD;
one. In the beating that you design for me,~ou&#xD;
might chance to meet with the worst,, and then ~iod&#xD;

said Conrad, "and his providence has endowed me&#xD;
with a stout frame also. To thy mountains, there-&#xD;
fore, begone, thou hateful monster-I warn thee for&#xD;
the lasttime!"&#xD;
Then Waldmann, being at these last words vio-&#xD;
lently provoked, fell upon Conrad, and a tough and&#xD;
obstinate battle raged between them. They strug~&#xD;

gled backwards and forwards, and twined their&#xD;
arms round each other, victory remaining, for a&#xD;
long while uncertain, till at last, Conrad, by a mas-&#xD;
ter-stroke in wrestling, brought his opponent to the&#xD;
ground, kneeled upon his breast, and, continuing to&#xD;
pommel him heartily as he lay, cried aloud: " Now&#xD;
shalt thou learn what it is to lift thine arm against&#xD;
thy liege master, thou treacherous fiend of the moun-&#xD;
tains!"&#xD;
The prostrate Waldmann, however, laughed so&#xD;
heartily at all this, that Conrad, believing that he&#xD;
made game of him, redoubled his blows with great-&#xD;
er violence, till at last his victim called aloud, "Let&#xD;
alone! Let alone! I do not laugh at thee, but at my-&#xD;
self, and I now humbly beg pardon !" "That is an-&#xD;
other affair," said the generous Conrad, who now&#xD;
immediately rose up, and assisted his conquered ad-&#xD;
versary to get upon his legs. "I have tried this&#xD;
way of life long enough, in all conscience," said&#xD;
Rubezahl, still laughing, "I dare swear it never&#xD;
happened to any one of my rank before, to carry his#&#xD;
education so far! But, listen, friend, you must at&#xD;
least confess that I have dealt honourably by you,&#xD;
for you well know that, in one moment, I could have&#xD;
brought a whole troop of mountain spirits to my as-&#xD;
sistance. However, to say the truth, I could not&#xD;
hayc called on them for laughing."&#xD;
Conrad looked thoughtfully at IRubezahl, who&#xD;
continued his mirth, and at last said, "I must ac-&#xD;
knowledge that thou hast reason now to bear me a&#xD;
grudge, and of this I shall probably feel the conse-&#xD;
quences, not only oh the Field of Terror, but else-&#xD;
where. But, Sir, I cannot repent of what I have&#xD;
done I used only the right of an honest household-&#xD;
er, and all for the sake of my beloved children.&#xD;
Truly, if it were yet to do, I should act heartily, in&#xD;
the same manner."&#xD;
"No, no!" said the laughing Rubezahl, "Give&#xD;
yourself no trouble, I have for one time, had quite&#xD;
enough. But of this much, however, be assured~&#xD;

~ the;e words, and with a familiar and confi-&#xD;
dential nod, he vanished, nor did Conrad ever be-~&#xD;
hold him again. Rubezahi, however, failed not to&#xD;
remember his promise, which, indeed, was much&#xD;
more than fulfilled. An extraordinary blessing at-&#xD;
t~nded all the labours of Conrad, ~nd he was, in a&#xD;
short time, the richest farmer in the village. When&#xD;
his children played upon the Field of Terror, which&#xD;
both they and Sabina now visited without appre-&#xD;
hension, they told sometimes, how the good Wald-&#xD;
mann had come, ~nd with what pretty stories he&#xD;
had entertained, them. At such times, the little&#xD;
ones were agreeably surprised to find their pockets&#xD;
stored with sweetmeats or glittering toys, among&#xD;
which a valuable gold coin was frequently dis-&#xD;

Who was present at the passion of the Lord, and&#xD;
spoke with him, and who yet lives as a witness to the&#xD;
truth of the Christian religion, and whether he had&#xD;
ever seen or heard of him, seriously affirmed the&#xD;
truth of such report; and a certain knight of Anti..&#xD;

who was also known to one of the abbot's servants,&#xD;
(by name Henry de Spigournel,) spoke in the&#xD;

French as follows: CC My master well knows that&#xD;
man, and a little before he journied to the xvest, the&#xD;
said Joseph ate at his table, whom he had often seen&#xD;
and heard speak." And being afterwards asked re-&#xD;
specting what passed between our Lord Jesus Christ&#xD;
and the said Joseph, he answered thus: "In the&#xD;
time of the passion of Jesus Christ, when, having&#xD;
been taken by the Jews, he was brought before the&#xD;
Governor, Pilate, in the pra4orium, to be judged by&#xD;
him. Plate, finding no cause of death in him, said&#xD;
to them, 'Do ye take him, and judge him accord-&#xD;
ingto your own law.' lint as the Jews continued&#xD;
to clamour yet more loudly, he dismissed l Barabbas,&#xD;
according to their petition, and delivered to then~&#xD;
Christ, that he might be crucified. While the Jews&#xD;
were drawingg Christ without the pr~etorium, and&#xD;
when he had come to the gate, and Was passing into&#xD;
it, Cartaphilus, porter of the pr~torium to Pontius&#xD;
Plate, struck him on the back with his fist, in a&#xD;
contemptuous manner, and mocking him, said-' Go,&#xD;
Jesus, go quicker-why do you delay?' Whereup-&#xD;
on, Jesus, looking back on him with a severe coun-&#xD;
ten ance, said-" I go, and thou shalt wait until I re~&#xD;
turn :" it is said according to that saying of the&#xD;
evangelist. Therefore, by th~ word of God, the&#xD;
aforesaid Cartaphulus is still waiting; he having been&#xD;
aged about thirty years at the time of the passion of&#xD;
our Lord; and ever, as soon as he arrives at the age&#xD;
of an hundred, he is seized, as it were, with an in-&#xD;
curable infirmity, and is raiished in a sort of ecsta-&#xD;
cy; and upon recovering his senses, finds himself&#xD;
again returned back to the same age at which he&#xD;
was in the year when our Lord suffered-so that he&#xD;
may truly say, with the Psalmist, 'My youth is re~&#xD;
newed like that of an eagle.' When the Catholic&#xD;
faith increased, this same Cartaphilus was baptized&#xD;
by that Ananias who baptized Saint P~ul, and was&#xD;
called Joseph. He frequently sojourns in either&#xD;

might pardon his murderers, as unknowing what&#xD;
they did; and that St. Paul, also, 'Sinning in igno-&#xD;

FABLE CONCERNING CHRIsT'S RAIsING JAPHET, THE&#xD;
SON OF NOAH-.&#xD;
MAHOMET, being questioned respecting Noah's&#xD;
ark, and the deluge, and the general extermination&#xD;
caused by it, whether these things~ were true, and to&#xD;
be believed according to the narration of Moses in&#xD;
Genesis, answered and said to his disciples, " When&#xD;
the Lord Jesus was walking about the confines of&#xD;
Jeriusalem; preaching, being asked by his disciples&#xD;
concerning the said deluge, he thus certified the&#xD;
fact to their doubtful minds. Finding a piece of&#xD;
turf lying before him, he struck it with his foot, and&#xD;
said, ' Arise, Japhet, thou son of Noah!' whereupon&#xD;
Japhet arose, springing, as -it were, out of the turf; a&#xD;
man of goodly aspect, aged, but sorely astonished.&#xD;
Jesus asked him, wherefore ,he was aifrighted,&#xD;
whereupon he answered and said, 'Lord, hearing the&#xD;
trumpet of thy voice, I feared, for I thought I was&#xD;
called to the general judgment of the resurrection-"&#xD;
Jesus answering, said to him, ' Fear not, for the&#xD;
hour of judgment (or resurrection is not yet come.&#xD;
But I have called thee from the grave, that thou,&#xD;
who wast in the ark with thy father, mightest relate&#xD;
the whole truth respecting it, to these who are here&#xD;
bystanding. Japhet, thereupon, taking up the pa-&#xD;
rable, thus began his relation: ' During the inunda-&#xD;
tion of the deluge, we were in the ark, to wit, the&#xD;
men apart, and the animals in the stable, which was&#xD;
on one side of the ark, and the hay and corn on the&#xD;
other side. When four months had elapsed, the ari&#xD;
began to shake, as it ,were tottering, and to lean&#xD;
towards that side in which the beasts were. For&#xD;
the animals, accumulating their dung, while they&#xD;
continually consumed the food which produced it,&#xD;
gradually preponderated. -One side of the ark,&#xD;
therefore, (namely, that which contained the corn,)&#xD;
became elevated, while the other, (wherein were&#xD;
20&#xD;
&#xD;
the animals) was depressed in proportion, so that we&#xD;
were in some danger, and feared greatly. Nor did&#xD;
we dare to perform any thing of moment without&#xD;
first consulting the Lord. Having, therefore, per-&#xD;
formed a sterifice with prayer, the Lord was appeas-&#xD;
ed, and said to us, ' Make yourselves a heap of the&#xD;
dung of men and camels, instead of an altar, and&#xD;
when you have sacrificed on it, you shall have a re-&#xD;
medy for your tribulation.' Which when we had&#xD;
done, a great sow issued forth oit of the heap, and,&#xD;
by scattering abroad that -great quantity of filth,&#xD;
w hereby the ark had before been nearly overset,&#xD;
saved us. But, after a few days, the sow, having&#xD;
performed its duly, and being no longer serviceable&#xD;
to us, we judged it too unclean an animal, and some&#xD;
amongst us thought even of casting it into the sea;&#xD;
but being the gift of God, and through him the in.&#xD;
strument of our safety, we still supported its pre-&#xD;
sence, although unwillingly. In consequence of&#xD;
' which trespass, the Lord sent upon us the following&#xD;
chastisement: the sow, in snorting, emitted from its&#xD;
nostrils, a troop of large famished mice, which, run&#xD;
ning about the ark, destroyed, by nibbling, its&#xD;
beams, its tackle, and all our provisions; and thus,&#xD;
this same sow, which was sought by us, and given to&#xD;
us, as a remedy, became, through our transgression&#xD;
a great calamity; whilst we, therefore, repented,&#xD;
and cried out to the Lord in our tribulation, the&#xD;
Lord being appeased, said to us, ' Ye have with you&#xD;
a lion--strike him on the forehead, with a hammer,&#xD;
but not unto death, and he shall be your deliverer-~&#xD;
whom, when'we had stricken, according to the com-&#xD;
mand of the Lord, he roared aloud, and, in roaring,&#xD;
emitted out of his mouth a cat, which pursued the&#xD;
mice until it destroyed them, and freed the ark from&#xD;
that pest. And to the end that you may not doubt&#xD;
the production of the sow from the dung of the men&#xD;
and camels, an evident argument proves it: for the&#xD;
sow, in its interior parts, is assimulated unto man-&#xD;
and, in its exterior parts, being a quadruped, it does&#xD;

not to be accounted for, but facts prove that theywaed&#xD;
possible." This assertion was commonly foledeit&#xD;
by a long string of circumstances, proving to hemis-&#xD;
ence- of ghosts, which had occurred eiter ft the-&#xD;
selves or to their friends. Some of thesth lasuare&#xD;
certainly very striking. It is therefore wit p liute-&#xD;
that I increase the number, with the flowing lie&#xD;
rally true narr ative which befel myself at Coeg e-&#xD;
I had already been a year and a half at the nird-&#xD;
sity, and had lived during that time, in th  hr&#xD;
story of the house then rerited by Professor -&#xD;
The room belonging to the maid servant who atsend-&#xD;
ed me, and Rose, ,the Professor's pretty nursey-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE APPARITION.&#xD;
maid, was on the second floor., One night, in the&#xD;
month of December, I came home about eleven&#xD;
o'clock, and, in passing, went into the servant's&#xD;
apartment to light a candle. Here I began to joke&#xD;
with their, about their carelessness, in leaving their&#xD;
door open so late, and threatened, laughing, to pay&#xD;
them a mnconlight visit before long. " Yes," replied&#xD;
the nursery maid, " you tried to do it last night, but&#xD;
why did you not come in? you were afraid, I sup-&#xD;
pose, because it was so dark; but we unlocked the&#xD;
door ,again, as soon as you were gone." I assured&#xD;
the girl that she was mistaken, and that I had never&#xD;
made such an attempt. Rose's companion confirm-&#xD;
ed the girl's story, and I persisted in my assertion&#xD;
which was strictly consistent with truth.&#xD;
The girls were as much at a loss what to think of&#xD;
the matter as myself, till at length my maid took&#xD;
it into her head, that the nocturnal visitor of the&#xD;
preceding night could be no other than the ghost of&#xD;
the late Dr. 5-., the former possessor of the house,&#xD;
by whom she assured me it was yet haunted.. On&#xD;
this~she described hiim as a tall thin man, in'a scarlet&#xD;
p lush coat, with a huge wig, spindle shanks, and&#xD;
Long withered fleshless hands. -At this idea and ac-&#xD;
count I laughed heartily, took my candle, and retired&#xD;
to my apartment, where I drank a few glasses of light&#xD;
wine, and read for a short time, before I went to bed.&#xD;
I know not how long I might have slept, when the -&#xD;
abovementioned Dr. S5. appeared, in the identical&#xD;
dress which the maid had described; and, without&#xD;
ceremony, or uttering a single word, seized me with&#xD;
his skeleton hand, below the ri ht breast. I at-.&#xD;
tempted to defend myself, and t is awakened me.&#xD;
The doctor had vanished, but still I felt his ice cold&#xD;
band, below my bre ast. I kept striking at it, threw oft'&#xD;
the bed clothes, talked aloud to convince myself:I was&#xD;
not dreaming, and struck with increased violence at&#xD;
the hand that held me fast, but in vain;' I found it&#xD;
impossible to. disengage myself-" It cannot be a&#xD;
dream," cried I, springing out of bed. I pai to the&#xD;

window, and tried to throw it up, but as it would&#xD;
not immediately open, I dashed it in pieces with such&#xD;
force, that the noise brought a shoemaker, who lived&#xD;
on the opposite side oC the street, and who was still&#xD;
at work to his window. "Well don e," cried he,&#xD;
"some tipsy student or other, at the professor's&#xD;
windows."-I could not forbear laughing aloud, at&#xD;
the man's conjecture. During all this time, I was&#xD;
struggling with the death cold hand, and striving in&#xD;
Vain to release myself from its grasp. I looked out&#xD;
of the Window, to be convinced I was in full posses-&#xD;
sion of my faculties, and still feeling the strange&#xD;
band maintain its hold, I began to consider how I&#xD;
should procure a light. At length it occurred to me&#xD;
to use my right hand, for hitherto I had fought only&#xD;
with my left; and behold the icy hand quitted its&#xD;
place; forit was no other than my own. I had pro-&#xD;
bably lain uncovered, and had grasped my side in&#xD;
consequence of the cramp, or some ~other affection&#xD;
of that kind. Next day I found visible traces of this&#xD;
nocturnal apparition, in five black marks under my&#xD;
breast. Had I possessed more delicate nerves, a&#xD;
little more faith in ghosts, and a timid character, I&#xD;
might easily, after jumping out of bed, and cow.&#xD;
yin cing myself that I was awake, have fainted away,&#xD;
and next day have shown my black marks as proof&#xD;
positive, that the kind hearted Dr. S-, who took&#xD;
pleasure ~ll his life in doing good, had appeared to&#xD;
me in the character of a persecuting spirit.&#xD;
Unimportant as this story may appear, in many&#xD;
respects, still I think it may furnish a key to the ex-&#xD;
planation of many accounts of apparitions.&#xD;

As these stories of OUt forefathers are now gradually&#xD;
dying away, and in a few years will, in all probahilitY~ em-&#xD;
tirely vanish, from the creed of our peasantry, it may be&#xD;
as amusing, to those who consider the study of the human&#xD;

legends, with which the memory, or rather the imagination&#xD;
of many an Archy, about forty years ago, was stored.&#xD;
~c His lonesome travels through the trackless moss."&#xD;
"I was laundering," said Archy, "ae misty morning,&#xD;
just atween day and the sun, thro' Gilchristland moss, and&#xD;
aye as I gaed on, the mOss seemed to spin round, and&#xD;

the residence of one of the petty tyrants under the&#xD;
Counts of Hapsbourg, who from this recess, defend-&#xD;

the whole district with impunity. The tyrant at&#xD;
length having carried off a young woman, whom&#xD;
he intended as a victim of his brutality, this act&#xD;
brought on the punishment he had so long merited.&#xD;
In fine, her two brothers surprised the infamous ra-&#xD;

day, to ascertain the fact, which led to the retalia-&#xD;

the same night every year; the female with the&#xD;

THE FALSE GUARDIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
ABOUT fifty years ago there arrived in London an&#xD;
elderly gentleman and his wife. They took a house&#xD;
formerly situated in Old-street, and there lived in a&#xD;
very recluse and solitary manner; keeping no ser-&#xD;
vant, the wife 'doing all the business of the house&#xD;
herself. In this manner they lived some time, till&#xD;
one evening, as the gentleman was taking his usual&#xD;
walk, he suddenly, as it is supposed, fell down and&#xD;
expired, where he was found by some laborers re-&#xD;
turning from work. In a few nights after his burial&#xD;
the wife complained to her neighbours of the house&#xD;
being haunted by his apparition, which often ap-&#xD;
peared to her, requesting some of them to sit up&#xD;
with her a few nights. Accordingly, some of them&#xD;
offered themselves, however, totally disbelieving her&#xD;
story. When night came, the woman went to bed,&#xD;
and two or three men sat up in the kitchen. Best&#xD;
part of the night passing without any molestation,&#xD;
they now thought themselves j)erfectly secure from&#xD;
any ghostly attacks. At length the tremendous&#xD;
hour of twelve arrived, when, to their great terror&#xD;
and astonish~ei~t, the large passage door suddenly&#xD;
unbolted, and in came the form of a large bear! It&#xD;
passed through the kitchen, without taking any no-&#xD;
tice of them, ascended the stairs, and entered the&#xD;
room where the woman lay, (but, before it entered,&#xD;
assumed a less terrible appearance, viz, that of her&#xD;
husband,) where its chief aim seemed to be to draw&#xD;
her out of bed; which, when it could not effect, it&#xD;
instantly vanished. The same apparition continued&#xD;
several nights, but in various shapes, such as a bear,&#xD;
mastifl &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c. It at length gained its point so far&#xD;
as to get the woman out of bed, and lead her into an&#xD;
adjoining apartment, where it pointed to a certain&#xD;
chest, and then vanished. She got the chest opened,&#xD;
and found in it the writings of an estate belonging to&#xD;

IN the mountainous region, called the Berg.-&#xD;

was formerly the custom for the young men, when&#xD;
they came to a certain age, to enroll themselves in a&#xD;
company of hunters, for the express pups  fpr&#xD;
suing and destroying wolves; for which reason, the&#xD;
band was called t'he woif-slaughterers. Indeed, that&#xD;

the chase till he had brought home the head of a&#xD;
wolf, to reduce their conquests to the same level.&#xD;
This rivalry was, however, not the occasion of any&#xD;
enmity between these young men; for, as they had&#xD;
been brought up from children together, they were&#xD;
accustomed to strive for the same prizes, and engage&#xD;
in the same 11ndertakings, so that they were always&#xD;
most pleased when both succeeded in the same de-&#xD;
gree. Indeed, it is said, that when one had the su-&#xD;
periority, he always relaxed his exertions, till the&#xD;
other came up with him, and that they retained this&#xD;
habit in the chase; for Wolfgang has been known,&#xD;
after he had killed one beast, to miss the next pur-&#xD;
posely, that Hendrick might strike it; and Henorick&#xD;
has done the sar~me, when fortune was on his side.&#xD;
Another reason why there was n~ quarrel between&#xD;
them, perhaps~ was, that they were both equally&#xD;
handsome. Not that they were alike in feature,&#xD;
though they were of the same height; for Wolf-&#xD;
gang's beauty had a boldness in it, which 1-leudrick'S&#xD;
wanted, but then Hendrick's countenance was calni&#xD;
and interesting, and as their tempers agreed with&#xD;
their p~rson5, each thought his own exterior the best,&#xD;
so that envy did not threaten to render their friend-&#xD;
ship of short duration. There is, however, always&#xD;
some stumbling block in the way of perfect hap-&#xD;
piness, and this the friends met with.&#xD;
it chanced, one evening, whilst returning by&#xD;
themselves from the chase, bearing on the points of&#xD;
their spears, the heads of two wolves, which they&#xD;
had just slaughtered, that they passed through a&#xD;
deep narrow glen, leading between high rocky&#xD;
banks, from the clefts of which grew out birch and&#xD;
mountain ash trees, in such numbers, as to over-&#xD;
shadow their path, and give a wild gloom to the&#xD;
space beneath. 'rhey had not reached half way,&#xD;
when they heard a loud growl, and looking carefully&#xD;
round, espied a hideous monster, partly concealed&#xD;
amongst tall stones and low bushes. Wolfgang&#xD;
cried out," a boar! a boar !" and Hendrick exclaini&#xD;
33&#xD;
&#xD;
TI{i BOARW0LF.&#xD;
ed, "a wolf! a wolf!" both preparing instantly to&#xD;
attack it. But the brute, which was employed in&#xD;
devouring its prey, after displaying a frightful pair&#xD;
of ja~vs, and making show of resistance, turned its&#xD;
tail, and fled through the underwood, hidden from&#xD;
their view, till it reached the mouth of the ravine,&#xD;
when springing suddenly out, it escaped into a more&#xD;
*     open country. The huntsrnen, however, knowing&#xD;
that it must choose to fly through the gorge of the&#xD;
*     pass, or remain in the deli, had hurried that way,&#xD;
and were close at its heels, when it darted from the&#xD;
thicken. This gave them hopes, and giving full rein&#xD;
to their horses, they pursued it over a wide piece of&#xD;
healthy waste. They had now a good opportunity&#xD;
for ascertaining the nature of the animal they fol-&#xD;
lowed; but, notwithstanding their skill in the chase,&#xD;
they were unable to decide what kind of beast it&#xD;
was; for, though it had the straight back, bushy tail,&#xD;
and long gallop of a wolf, still it had the thick,&#xD;
bristly, and snorted head of a boar, and its feet&#xD;
were not similar to those of any animal they had&#xD;
seen. I'hey, therefore, supposed it might be some&#xD;
mongrel brute, or one of the wild beasts brought&#xD;
from Syria, which had broken loose from the me-&#xD;
nage of the Archbishop of Mentz. But, be it what&#xD;
it might, they pushed after it with the greatest reso-&#xD;
lution, because, when they had started it from its&#xD;
lurking place, they perceived it had been tearing in&#xD;
pieces the body of a child.&#xD;
The direction which the monster took, led them&#xD;
across a small stream, that divided their district&#xD;
frm the neighboring one, and brought them at&#xD;
last, into a place dangerous for horsemen, and diffi-&#xD;
cult for the pursuit of game. It was an extensive&#xD;
level, reachir~g from the rivulet to a distant range of&#xD;
hills, and would have been a plain had it not been&#xD;
covered with hugh masses of detached rock, scatter&#xD;
ed about it, as if a large mountain had been dashed&#xD;
to pieces, and strewed over its surface. Many of&#xD;
the fragments were so large, that they resembled&#xD;

and hung down, trees and shrubs of every descrip-&#xD;

as to leave caverns and arches between their sides,&#xD;
and the red glare of the sun, setting behind the&#xD;
hills, gleamed through these openings in a wild and&#xD;
beautiful manner. Other pieces were small and&#xD;
plentiful, lying in heaps a~ wdl as separately,&#xD;
amongst the larger masses; so that, though there&#xD;
were many roads and passages between these rocks,&#xD;
still they were rendered unsafe for horses by these&#xD;
lesser stones.&#xD;
The hunters had scarcely entered this region, be-&#xD;
fore they lost sight of their game; but, hoping to re-&#xD;
gain the scent, they dashed forward amongst the&#xD;
pathways, and after a short time saw the brute turn-&#xD;
ing roun(l the corner. This tempted them still far-&#xD;
ther, till, after bewildering themselves amidst the&#xD;
intricacies of this desert, they gave over the pursuit~&#xD;
having ceased for some time to see the monster, and,&#xD;
indeed it was growing so dark, that they would not&#xD;
have been long able to view it had it been before&#xD;
them.&#xD;
They now thought of returning home to Fienden&#xD;
heim, and turned their horses the way contrary to&#xD;
that which they had come, and, as they rode along,&#xD;
wondering what kindof beast they had chased, they&#xD;
found that their exertion had both fatigued them,&#xD;
and made them excessively thirsty. Accordingly,&#xD;
they resolved to take a full draught from the stream,&#xD;
when they reached it, and agreed to ask permission&#xD;
of the Lord of that domain to bring their whole&#xD;
troop on the following day, to give full pursuit to so&#xD;
dang~roUs a monster. They were talking about ~he&#xD;
dogs and weapons they would bring irjth them,&#xD;
when they caught a glimpse of a light, at a short dis-&#xD;
tance, and wishing to obtain, if possible, something&#xD;
better than a draught of water, to quench their&#xD;
thirst, they made towards it, and arrPved at the door&#xD;
'if a residence, half cottage, and half cavern, which&#xD;
40&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BOARWoLF.&#xD;
stood under the side of one of the largest niasscs or&#xD;
rock, and they recollected that this place was the&#xD;
habitation of a hermit, a recluse so austere that he&#xD;
hardly ever suffered himself to be seen by any body.&#xD;
They k~-iocked at the door, however, and it was&#xD;
opened, not by an old man, with a white beard, as&#xD;
they expected, but by a beautiful girl, of about six-&#xD;
teen, whose face and figure far excelled those of all&#xD;
*the daughterss of their native hamlet, and, in truth,&#xD;
of any other place they knew. She blushed at first,&#xD;
and seemed inclined to close the door again, but&#xD;
Wolfgang asked, in a tone of compliment, that she&#xD;
would give hun a draught of milk, and Hendrick&#xD;
seconded him, with such gentle supplication, that&#xD;
she felt almost compelled to speak; and, then, not&#xD;
liking to refuse s6 small a request, she brought&#xD;
out a lage jug, not of milk, but of true Rhenish&#xD;
wine, which she poured out into horns, an(I offered&#xD;
to each of the huntsman. They accepted her gifts&#xD;
with many thanks, which she received with smiles;&#xD;
and by way of prolonging the conversation, they in&#xD;
quired whether she had seen or heard of any strange&#xD;
heast'near her habitation. She replied, that, within&#xD;
the last days, her father had told her that he had&#xD;
seen an animal that he had never seen before, and&#xD;
had bidden her be careful that she was not surprised,&#xD;
for that it was very ferocious, and had carried off&#xD;
the child of one of the inhabitants of the village of&#xD;
Grifhausen. She then invited them to alight, say-&#xD;
ing that, perhaps, her parent could tell them more&#xD;
concerning it.&#xD;
The young men were both so fascinated with this&#xD;
beauty, that they would willingly have spent.some.&#xD;
hours in gazing at and conversing with her; but, for&#xD;
some reason or other, they obstinately refused, al-&#xD;
though she pressed them to enter the cottage. After&#xD;
a little more conversation she wished them good&#xD;
night; and though they both intended to see her&#xD;
again, neither of them mentioned a word of his in~&#xD;
tion, either to her or to his companion. Indeed,&#xD;

from that moment they became so desperately&#xD;
jealous of each other, (which was the reason why&#xD;
they would not stop that night, each looking upon&#xD;
the other as a rival,) that they scarcely spoke all the&#xD;
way l)ack to Fiendenheim; and the next day, in-&#xD;
stead of summoning the troop to give the beast chase,&#xD;
each rokle separately in search of the cottage, where&#xD;
they met, and quarrelle(l for. the first time; and so&#xD;
bitter was their enmity afterwards, that it would&#xD;
have been a pleasure to either of them, to have run&#xD;
the other through with a boar spear.&#xD;
Meantime the wild monster committed great ra~&#xD;
vag~s throughout the surrounding country, and&#xD;
it became unsafe for men unarmed, and wo-&#xD;
men and children, to pass from 'one village to the&#xD;
ether; so that there was a general alarm spread round&#xD;
about, for a great distance. The wolf-hunters&#xD;
made many attempts to destroy it, but in vain; for,&#xD;
though it did not keep out of the way by day, yet it&#xD;
was so swift, and so artful in eluding pursuit, that&#xD;
all their endeavours were fruitless. Even X~r0lf~&#xD;
gang and Hendrick could gain no advantage over&#xD;
their companions, except getting a little closer to&#xD;
the beast than the rest. At length, the lords of three&#xD;
villages, which this animal infested, fancying that&#xD;
there might be some want of energy, in the attempts&#xD;
to destroy it, or, perhaps, a little i'ear, offered a re-&#xD;
ward of a piece of land, to the man who should pro~&#xD;
dace its head, "to belong to him and his heirs for&#xD;
ever," besides the privilege of choosing the fairest&#xD;
maiden within their domains as a wife, to whom&#xD;
they also promised a portion.&#xD;
This offer produced a great commotion among the&#xD;
young men of the three villages, as well as among&#xD;
the maidens; all of them being willing to obtain the&#xD;
reward; but upon Wolfgang and Hendrick it had&#xD;
a very strong effect. Since tirst beholding the young&#xD;
beauty among the rocks, they had both striven to&#xD;
gain her as a wife, but, though she gave them equal&#xD;
audience, she declared positively in favour of nei&#xD;

ther of them. But when the reward was offered for&#xD;
the head of the beast, ~he said she would willingly&#xD;
~i~re her hand to the hunisman who should obtain it.&#xD;
Thus, besides the hope of obtaining the reward, and&#xD;
the beaut~, there was the fear that another shotdd&#xD;
gain her; and Wolfgang ~aid, that he would rather&#xD;
the beast should tear him to pieces, than that Jiend-&#xD;
rick should become possessed of her; and Hendrick&#xD;
said much the same of 'Wolfgang. Nevertheless,&#xD;
the monster continued his rai ages~ though all the&#xD;
country was in arms against him, and it was at length&#xD;
reported, that Count Albert, of Fiendenheim, was&#xD;
going to invite all the knights and warriors of his&#xD;
acquaintance, to come and make a grand attempt to&#xD;
rid his lan(ls of such a scourge.&#xD;
When it came to be known that Wolfgang and&#xD;
Hendrick had quarrelled, the inhabitants of their&#xD;
village were anxious to know the cause of (lisagree-&#xD;
ment between such strict friends, and they soon&#xD;
found it out. But when the young men of Fienden-&#xD;
heim had seen the damsel, they sai(l they could find&#xD;
nothing in her so enchanting, that there were many&#xD;
girls in their own hamlet far superior to her; and,&#xD;
in fact, that she was more disagreeable than l)leas-&#xD;
Ing. On the other hand, the two huntsman had told&#xD;
their sisters that there could not be a greater beauty&#xD;
among women, that her countenance was delightfully&#xD;
fascinating; her eyes of the most brilliant black, her&#xD;
lips glowing coral, her nose finely formed, her com-&#xD;
plexion radient with health, and her curling tresses&#xD;
of the loveliest auburn. 'I'his, of course, tempted&#xD;
many of the young women t'o make an opportunity&#xD;
of seeing her, and they agreed with the young men,&#xD;
that she was any thing but agreeable. They found&#xD;
her features sharp and vixen-like, her eyes too small,&#xD;
and glowing more like live coals than diamonds, her&#xD;
nose hooked, her complexion of a j)eculiar sallow,&#xD;
and hex' locks elfish, snake-like, and of a fiery red&#xD;
colour. Her shape, which they had l)ecn told was&#xD;
CKquisite, they thought too flimsy, and her dress was&#xD;

so gaudy and scanty, that they agreed she resembled&#xD;
one of the lost girls who wandered about the streets&#xD;
of Mentz, to tempt young men to their ruin, more&#xD;
than a modest inhabitant of the district of Brocken-&#xD;
cragg; and, in fine, they all agreed that she had in-&#xD;
fused some philter into the wine she had given to&#xD;
Wolfgang and Hendrick,~ and thereby deprived&#xD;
them of the right use of their senses and understand-&#xD;
ing. But, what displeased them more than any thing&#xD;
else, was, that she refused to tell from whence she&#xD;
came, or who her father was; nor would she listen&#xD;
to any inquiries about her family, saying, that those&#xD;
who liked her need not know her friends, and that&#xD;
those who disliked her should not.&#xD;
Wolfgang, as I have already said, was of a temper&#xD;
somewhat impatient, and when he heard that Count&#xD;
Albert purposed calling his friends to assist him,&#xD;
fearing he should lose an opportunity of at once ac-&#xD;
quiring the beauty, he mounted his horse, arid set&#xD;
out on the chase, swearing he would never return&#xD;
Without the head of the monster; an(I, accordingly,&#xD;
he tried every art he was acquainted with, to sur-&#xD;
prise it unawares, for when it was conscious of being&#xD;
pursued, nobody had any chance of coming up with&#xD;
it. All his address and toil, through the heat of the&#xD;
day, was, however, of no avail to him. Twenty&#xD;
times had he been on the point of plunging his short&#xD;
sword between its ribs, and as often had it slipped&#xD;
aside, and disappointed him At last, towards even-&#xD;
ing, when all the rest similarly engaged, had given&#xD;
up the chase, he fancied that the animal appeare(l&#xD;
lame, and exhausted with fatigue. Although he was&#xD;
scarcely otherwise himself, this idea (lisSipated all&#xD;
his weariness, and hoping he might now run him&#xD;
down, he borrowed a fresh horse from the nearest&#xD;
house, and returning to where it lay, hid in its lair,&#xD;
he forced it to rise, and betake itself to that same&#xD;
plain over which he had first pursued it, in company&#xD;
wab Hendrick. He had now no doubt that it iva~&#xD;
uiaiiued, for it ran with a limping gait, and with less&#xD;
44&#xD;
&#xD;

speed than before. However, it managed to keep&#xD;
him at too great a distance behind to wound it, and,&#xD;
taking the same course it had formerly done, it led&#xD;
him across the boundary stream, and amon~ those&#xD;
wildly scattered crags where it had once escaped&#xD;
before. But as Wolfgang had now more advantage&#xD;
than at that time, both in the freshness of his horse&#xD;
arid the knowledge of the roads, which he had ac-&#xD;
quired by visiting, the cottage, he was able to keep&#xD;
the boarivoff (for so the monster was called by th~&#xD;
peasantry) in sight.&#xD;
The red glare of the setting sun was now again&#xD;
gleaming through the uncouth archways, and along&#xD;
the narrow passes of the rocks, as the impatient&#xD;
huntsman followed the brtite into the centre of the&#xD;
great level. Here, entering upon a small sandy&#xD;
space, scattere(i over with fragments of stone anO&#xD;
dead wood, Wolfgang lost sight of the animal, foi', as&#xD;
it reached the plain before him, he could not decide&#xD;
the way it had taken. His temper, which had long&#xD;
been giving way (luring the pursuit, now totally for-&#xD;
sook him, an(l throwing himself from his horse, he&#xD;
rolled upon the sand, cruising and blaspheming every-&#xD;
thing that came in his mind. He lay thus employed, at&#xD;
last, with his face towards the ground. when, fancy-&#xD;
ing that he felt a strange gust of heat pass over him, he&#xD;
turned his head, and beheld the figure of a being&#xD;
somewhat human, but more resembling a devil. It&#xD;
had horns, and a tail, its horns curled round its ears,&#xD;
and its tail was short, and' turned up like a hook. It&#xD;
was hairy all over, and its feet ended in hoofs, like&#xD;
those of a hog.&#xD;
Wolfgang was in~too great a rage t otremble.&#xD;
"Wolfgang," said the being, "if you will give me&#xD;
polver over you for four and twenty hours, you shall&#xD;
cut off the head of the boarwolI~"&#xD;
" I agree," said the huntsman, without stopping&#xD;
one moment to consider.&#xD;
"Then kiss my hand in token of obedience," said&#xD;
the stranger&#xD;

Wolfgang kissed the hand held out to him, and&#xD;
whilst he ~started back, for the touch ot'the being&#xD;
burnt his lips, it vanished, saying, "chase the board&#xD;
wolf to-morrow."&#xD;
The huntsman now remounted his horse, and,&#xD;
without allowing himself to think of what he had&#xD;
done, he hastened to the cottage of the beauty, with&#xD;
whom he staid conversing with till daylight, for both&#xD;
she and her father treated him as though they could&#xD;
not treat him too ivell.&#xD;
At day-break he saddled his steed, and set off to&#xD;
dislodge the boarwoif from its lurking place, impa-&#xD;
tient both to make sure of the rewards, and to return&#xD;
home, for, as he had vowed not to go back x~iithout&#xD;
the head, so he had kept his word.&#xD;
When Wolfgang reached the glen, where he ex-&#xD;
pected to meet the boarwolf, he found Hendrick&#xD;
there with some companions, who had risen early&#xD;
that moriAng to try the powers of two large dogs,&#xD;
which they had procured from a great distance.&#xD;
These were blood-hounds of a fine breed, and were&#xD;
now engaged by Hendrick, because all the other&#xD;
dogs that had been employed in the chase of this&#xD;
tuonster refused to follow it, being so terrified, that,&#xD;
whenever they were put upon the scent, they howl-&#xD;
ed and slunk away in fear. Wolfgang, elated with&#xD;
the kindness so lately shown him by the beauty and&#xD;
her father, and relying on the promise that he should&#xD;
cut off the head of the boarwoif, could not refrain&#xD;
from uttering a loud laugh of contempt, when he&#xD;
saw the pains taken by his former friend, and his&#xD;
associates. He even fid him, with a sneer, "go&#xD;
home and look out for a wife, for that he meant to&#xD;
marry the beauty that night himself." Hendrick&#xD;
was too intent on endeavouring to get scent of the&#xD;
wild beast, to, reply to these insults, and having as-&#xD;
certained that it was not in the dell, he hurried over&#xD;
the hills in search of it; and his rival, notivithstand&#xD;
ing his security, not being willing that he should&#xD;

THE BOA RWOLF.&#xD;
first start the game, set off'to another spot, where he&#xD;
once or twice had met the animal.&#xD;
About an hour after this, Wolfgang unearthed the&#xD;
boarwolt'. It sprung from beneath the root of an&#xD;
old withered yew-tree, which grew over a low dark&#xD;
cave, in the side of a bank, just as the sun rose bril-&#xD;
liantly from behind some opposite hills; and when&#xD;
the ferocious brute opened its *jaivs, to utter a hide-&#xD;
ous roar, its long turks gleamed in the morning rays,&#xD;
and the white foam spirted from its mouth like&#xD;
flakes of snow, while its bristly hide seemed to glit-&#xD;
ter in the light, as if throwing out sparks of fire,&#xD;
The eager huntsman rushed forward after it, eyeing&#xD;
with joy the ghastly grinning head, which he ex-&#xD;
pected soon to sever from its huge, ill-fashioned car-&#xD;
ease, and which was to form the foundation of his&#xD;
fortune, and the pledge of his union with his mis-&#xD;
tress. Hefo~got that Hendrick was also in the field&#xD;
with his friends, and their unerring dogs; or, if he&#xD;
thought of him, it was only to enjoy the anticipated&#xD;
mortification of his former friend, when he returned&#xD;
to the village, bearing with him the spoil for which&#xD;
they both thirsted so ardently.&#xD;
The boarwolf, however, as if conscious that its ex-&#xD;
istence was to terminate that day, seemed resolved&#xD;
to exercise the strength and perseverance of its pur-&#xD;
suer. It took wider and more intricate circuits than&#xD;
it had ever done before, it turned more frequently to&#xD;
bay, and almost appeared to enjoy the eager onsets&#xD;
which the huntsman made to overcome it; but the&#xD;
horse of Wolfgang could only he brought to ride at it&#xD;
by the most strenuous endeavors of its master, exhi-&#xD;
biting such evident marks of dismay at its glaring&#xD;
eyeballs, and erected bristles, that he could scarcely&#xD;
keep its head towards it; and when he offered to&#xD;
dismount, for the purpose of attacking it with his&#xD;
Sword, the monster took the opportunity of making&#xD;
off at full speed.&#xD;
In this manner, the chase continued till long past&#xD;
floo~~ by which time Wolfgang had become so faint,&#xD;

with hunger and exhaustion, that he could scarce!~&#xD;
keep his seat; for he had been extremely fatigued&#xD;
the day before, and had not closed his eyes during&#xD;
"~   the night, having been too much engaged with his&#xD;
mistress to think of sleep. Besides, he had scarcely&#xD;
tasted food 5j~C.C the morning o.f the day before, for&#xD;
he took nothing but wine at the hermitage, and this&#xD;
day he would not stop one moment to assuage his&#xD;
hunger at the cottages of his acquaintances~ near&#xD;
which he passed, lest the boarwolf should escape, or&#xD;
have time to renew his strength by rest. However,&#xD;
he recollected that his mistre5~, when she heard that&#xD;
he intended to renew the chase early in the morning,&#xD;
had given him a small cake, which she had prepar-&#xD;
ed during his stay, for she said that she was certain&#xD;
his eagerness would not allow him to think of re-&#xD;
freshment, and that her gift would quell his appe-&#xD;
tite, and support his strength, till he had slain the&#xD;
monster. Upon this he drew the loaf from his pock-&#xD;
et, and ate it, with many mental thanks for the kind&#xD;
attention of the giver, arid he felt his desire to&#xD;
slaughter the boarwolf increase, with his Wish&#xD;
to obtain the hand of so amiable a girl. As she&#xD;
had said, so the cake, though small, satisfied his hun-&#xD;
ger, and renewed his spirits, or, rather, made them&#xD;
more buoyant than before. IndeedSO much did he&#xD;
feel elated, that he spurred on his horse, as if just set&#xD;
off in the pursuit~ and the monster was oblige&amp;amp;to fly&#xD;
more quickly than it had ever done. But the weath-&#xD;
er, which had hithertobeen brilliant and enlivening,&#xD;
nOW suddenly altered; large masses of dark clouds&#xD;
rolled up from behind the distant mountains, the&#xD;
wind rose, and swept along the edges of the woods&#xD;
with violence; full drops of rain fell at intervals, and&#xD;
the distant waters of the river were heard rushing&#xD;
along their rocky bed. Wolfgang was too much ac-&#xD;
customed to the field, not to know that these signs&#xD;
presaged a storm; but his ardour would not permit&#xD;
anyx idea of relinquishing the pursuit to enter his&#xD;
mind; besides, he fanei~d these signs were but pr~&#xD;
&#xD;
iudes to the death of the boarwoif, and he gazed at&#xD;
it with exultation, as, for the third time that day, i~t&#xD;
hurried through the dcli, where he and Hendrick&#xD;
had first discovered it. His spirits, now high and&#xD;
free from fatigue, bore him along with a feeling of&#xD;
triumph, and though the wind shook the branches of&#xD;
the trees over his head, and sighed in the most&#xD;
threatening manner, he paid no attention to the im-&#xD;
pending tempest.&#xD;
At length, as he once more spurred along to the&#xD;
~ rocky level, the clouds burst above him, and a deluge&#xD;
of rain and hail surrounded him instantaneously; he&#xD;
seemed almost as if enclosed in a moving mass of&#xD;
water, and as the drops struck against the ground&#xD;
they broke into a fine mist, which rose up on the&#xD;
wind like a second shower, or as if the earth were&#xD;
heated and being quenched by the rain, while large&#xD;
hailstones flew and danced about in every direction,&#xD;
causing his horse to start repeatedly~&#xD;
So thick and heavy was the shower, that Wolf-&#xD;
gang lost sight of the boarwolf for a short time,&#xD;
though it still kept at the same distance before him.&#xD;
But an unusual darkness now begar to add to the&#xD;
horrors of the storm, not like the approach of night,&#xD;
but a deep gloom, as if the sun were losing its light.&#xD;
Thunder burst in loud peals amongst the hills, and&#xD;
flashes of lightning at times shot along before him.&#xD;
Yet all these combined terrors had no effect on the&#xD;
mind of the huntsman; at least he laughed at them&#xD;
with the feelings of a man intoxicated; for the few&#xD;
mouthfuls he had taken, had produced a state of idea&#xD;
almost similar to the effect caused by liquor, with-&#xD;
out impeding his capability of bodily action. A&#xD;
hundred times he blessed the providence of the&#xD;
beauty, in providing' against his fatigue, and he&#xD;
heard the swoin waters of the boundary streanTi foam&#xD;
amidst the stony winding of its channel, without&#xD;
one impression of fear, or suggestion of prudence.&#xD;
The boarwolf chose the widest whirlpool over&#xD;
which to leap, and Wolfgang sprung boldly over the&#xD;

boiling vortex. He heeded not the ~ibouring breath&#xD;
and staggering limbs of his courser, but spurred him&#xD;
violently, as he entered the district of Brokencragg.&#xD;
along the path which led to the hermitage, for in&#xD;
that direction the monster, proceeded before him.&#xD;
The storm raged with peculiar fury in this wild&#xD;
and desolate region. The wind roared hideously,&#xD;
as it rushed along the numerous passages amongst&#xD;
the rocks, and the summits of the tall trees, that&#xD;
grew upon them, were bent below the crevices in&#xD;
which their roots found nourishment. Twice did&#xD;
Wolfgang escape the fall of trunks, which were torn&#xD;
with harsh crashes from their beds, and many times&#xD;
was he nearly struck from his saddle by pieces of&#xD;
stone, broken from the margin of cliffs by the light..&#xD;
ning, which now darted closely around him. But&#xD;
his spirit, and his persuasion that the head of the&#xD;
monster would soon become his spoil, were unabated&#xD;
and unalloyed, till, just as he approached the cot-&#xD;
tage of his mistress, the boarwolf uttered a tremen-&#xD;
dous yell, whiTh was answered by the distant bay of&#xD;
dogs. "That fiend Hendrick !" muttered Wolf.&#xD;
gang, as the idea that his hated rival might rush in&#xD;
between him and his reward, glanced across his&#xD;
mind. He spurred on his steed, more unmercifully&#xD;
than before,' and was in an instant close by the her-&#xD;
mitage. The beauty, as if fearless of wild beasts, of&#xD;
lightning, or of thunder, stood at the door, waving&#xD;
her hand in encouragement to her lover, and he&#xD;
thought she seemed to enjoy the flashes of fire that&#xD;
glanced along before her; her face was bright, and&#xD;
her eyes shone, her hair floated in the wind. He&#xD;
heard her say, " Do you hear Hendrick?" and in a&#xD;
moment was out of her sight and hearing, for, having&#xD;
turned a corner, the brute led him directly&#xD;
to the centre of the level. All the fury of&#xD;
the storm seemed likewise to tend that way, for the&#xD;
violence oC the wind, rain, and hail, behind him,&#xD;
was almost intolerable. His horse rushed along, as&#xD;
if boriie by a rapid stream, striving more to keep it&#xD;

Even ~th&amp;amp;e he fancied tottered as he passed them,&#xD;
and shook their crumbling edge~ on his head;-.tit.&#xD;
tearing and grinning whispers seemed to mock his&#xD;
ears, as he listened to the deep mouthing of Hend-&#xD;
rick's blood-hounds; and the boarwoif growled and&#xD;
tore up the earth, as it fled before him. However,&#xD;
he gained upon it, and, only intent upon the accom-&#xD;
plishment of his wishes, drew f6rth his short sword,&#xD;
to make a desperate attack, for he perceived by its&#xD;
agitation and furious howl that it would soon turn to&#xD;
bay. Vie was close at its heels, as it entered upon&#xD;
the sandy space in the centre of the level, and at the&#xD;
instant the monster turned and offered resistance, his&#xD;
horse fell dead close beside it. The boar~~ol~sprun g&#xD;
upon Wolfgang, and ripped up his thigh with it~&#xD;
tusk; but the huntsman, though writhing with pain,&#xD;
struck a tremendous blow at its brawny neck, which&#xD;
cleft the spine, and the head hung from its shoulders.&#xD;
Another blow severed it completely; but at that in-&#xD;
slant a dense smoke, mingled with flame, issued&#xD;
from the carcass, *and the boarwoif was changed into&#xD;
that fiend-like being whom he had seen in that same&#xD;
place on the day before.&#xD;
"Wolfgang," it exclaimed to the terrified hunter,&#xD;
"thou hast cut off the head of the boarwolf; for&#xD;
twenty four hours thou art mine.-Aye, and for&#xD;
ever !-Be thou now a boarwolf!"&#xD;
"Not now," cried Wolfgang, gasping with horror&#xD;
at the thought, "Hendrick is coming, he will slay&#xD;
"I mean it," replied the demon, laughing fero..&#xD;
ciously, I brought him here, his dogs are mine-see&#xD;
he comes!&#xD;
Wolfgang turned his head and saw Hendrick&#xD;
rushing towards him; he felt his figure change~, his&#xD;
hands became feet, his head grew large and bristly,&#xD;

to fly or resist.&#xD;
The most hitter feelings of terror and despair&#xD;
overwhelmed his faculties He sprung into the air,&#xD;
and attempted to scream with rage, but he only ut-&#xD;
tered a harsh hoarse roar, like a boarwolf. It was&#xD;
answered by Hendrick, who at that moment fixe4&#xD;
his eye upon him, with a wild shout of joy; his&#xD;
friends also Thouted, and the blood-houndS, giving a&#xD;
tremendous yell, sprung upon him and held him&#xD;
firmly with their teeth. Hendrick leaped from his&#xD;
horse, and raised his sword, and while Wolfgang&#xD;
vainly strove to exclaim, "Spare me, Hendrick!&#xD;
spare me !" his rival and former friend smote off his&#xD;
head at a blow. His spirit fled with a groan, a&#xD;
dreadful clap of thunder shook the earth, a flash of&#xD;
lightning enveloped the group, and scathed the&#xD;
bleeding body of the huntsman; but Hendrick nev-&#xD;
ertheless lifted up the head, and with his compa-&#xD;
iiions gave three victorious shouts; he then thrust&#xD;
the point of his spear into the neck, and, remounting&#xD;
his horse, rode away from the plain with his associ-&#xD;
ates, bearing before him, unconsciously, the head of&#xD;
his once dearest friend.&#xD;
They made their way directly to Fiendenheim,&#xD;
and were received joyfully by the villagers, who ran&#xD;
to inform Count Albert. rL~l~e count received the&#xD;
spoil in form, admiring its ghastly look, and directed&#xD;
his seneschal to make out the deed of gift, of four&#xD;
acres of land, to Hendrick the wolf-slayer, to him&#xD;
and his heirs forever. He then bade the unfortu-&#xD;
nate huntsman choose the maiden he liked best for&#xD;
his bride, and bring her to him on the following&#xD;
morning, as he intended to bestow upon her a mar-&#xD;
riage portion.&#xD;
Hendrick, notwithstanding the fatigue he had un-&#xD;
dergone since day-break, could not resist the plea-&#xD;
sure of communicating his success to the beauty,&#xD;
and of claimingg her promise. He therefore quitted&#xD;
52&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BOA RWOLF.     /&#xD;
Fiendenheim, and took the direction ci' the Broken..&#xD;
agg level, with almost as much speed as if engag~&#xD;
in an~her chase. The weather was now calm&#xD;
and serene, the wind had subsided, not a drop of&#xD;
rain fell from the unclouded sky, and a pure and&#xD;
beautiful evening had succeeded to the tempestuous&#xD;
afternoon; nor would it have been suspected that&#xD;
such a storm had so recently occurred, had not the&#xD;
swoin streams, that rushed amongst the rocks, and&#xD;
over the pathways, been unusually large, and their&#xD;
loaded '~&#xD;
waters turmu, anu      i~1LU fragments oiuranczz&#xD;
es, and the spoils of their banks.&#xD;
By the time the eager lover arrived within sight&#xD;
of the cottage of his mistress, the first stars of even-&#xD;
ing had appeared, and a gentle gloom had fallen on&#xD;
all the surrounding objects. A calm stillness was&#xD;
spread over tI~e vast desert of shattered rocks, only&#xD;
interrupted by the croak of the raven, which sat&#xD;
among the overhanging trees, by the shriek of the&#xD;
owl, which floated forth from the recesses amongst the&#xD;
cliffs. But of a sudden, as Hendrick spurred his&#xD;
horse up to the door of tire hermitage, a strange&#xD;
wild shout of mirth burst from within the dwelling,&#xD;
composed of sounds and voices he had never heard&#xD;
before. The chimney, too, smoked violently, and a&#xD;
bright gleam of light shot from the casement across&#xD;
the pathway, and small rays issued from beneath the&#xD;
eaves, and crevices in the walls.&#xD;
Impatier:t and alarmed, Hendrick, with a lovers&#xD;
privilege, hastily opened the door, and entered; but&#xD;
what was his amazement to flnd himself in the midst&#xD;
of a comp~inyof beings of the most appalling descrip-&#xD;
tion. rrhere sat in the old chair, which the beauty's&#xD;
father was wontlo occupy, the same fiend who had&#xD;
tempted Wolfgang to his destructionn. Before him,&#xD;
in the midst of the floor, was a large fire, blazing up&#xD;
to the ceiling in blue flames, mingled with green&#xD;
and yellow. Around this (lanced a circle of devils,&#xD;
of all figures and sizes, throwing themselves into the&#xD;
most distorted attitudes, and shrieking at alternate&#xD;

intervals. Thete lay on the floor a human carcass,&#xD;
.he bead of which was concealed by a black veil,&#xD;
and the old fiend had his feet placed upon it, while&#xD;
his hOOfS, now lengthened into claws, penetrated the&#xD;
flesh, and when the demon contracted his talons, the&#xD;
body gave convulsive throes, and dashed its limbs&#xD;
about, to the great diversion of the assembly.&#xD;
Hendrick stood and stared aghast at this sight, for&#xD;
a crowd of fears and suspicions overwhelmed his&#xD;
soul. He looked around for the beauty and her fa-&#xD;
ther, but in vain; till at length a tall slender fiend&#xD;
'prung from the circle towards him, and seizing his&#xD;
~nd in her burning grasp, drew him forward, say-&#xD;
ing, "Why, Hendrick, my betrothed, do you not&#xD;
know your bride?"&#xD;
hendrick gazed on her, and saw in her sharpened&#xD;
features, parchment skin, and glowing eyes, some&#xD;
appearance of the girl who had been the sole object&#xD;
of his and Wolfgang's love; but with a shuddering&#xD;
start he endeavored to free himself from her gray"&#xD;
She, however, held him tightly, and drawing him r~&#xD;
the circle, another fiend caught him b; the hand, in&#xD;
the same manner, and he was thus forced to dance&#xD;
round the fire, as one of the group, whilst the demons&#xD;
grinned and chattered at him, with fearful and ma-&#xD;
lic~ous joy.&#xD;
Although the heart of Hendrick sunk within him,&#xD;
a~ the hideous figures and grimaces of his compa&#xD;
nions, his senses still remained collected, and hi~&#xD;
'thoughts were bent on finding some method of es&#xD;
camping from this detestable spot. His love and&#xD;
hopes were converted into the utmost disgust and&#xD;
dread, and his eyes wandered from side to side, to&#xD;
avoid the diabolical leers, and hellish mockery of the&#xD;
fiend who pretended to be his bride. She, however,&#xD;
seemed not to regard his hatred, but telling her crew&#xD;
that he was impatient for the conch~sion of his nup~&#xD;
tials, stopped opposite to the frightf~il demon who sat&#xD;
in the chair-"&#xD;

&#xD;

"Father," said she, "this is my bridegroom, he&#xD;
wishes you to unite us forever."&#xD;
"Have you the ring?" said the old fiend, in a&#xD;
narsh and hollow voice.&#xD;
"This is the one he gave me," said the pretended&#xD;
bride, heldiug forth one which Hendrick knew he&#xD;
had presented to her some days before.&#xD;
Is he willing to bind himself to you and yours?"&#xD;
said the presiding devil of this infernal ceremony.&#xD;
"You shall hear him promise," answere~J the&#xD;
bride. "Speak, Hendrick, love, speak!" continued&#xD;
she to the astonished huntsman, whose hair now&#xD;
stood on end, and whose limbs quaked be-neath'him,&#xD;
whilst the sweat stood cold upon his brow, although&#xD;
the room felt like a furnace.&#xD;
If' he ~vill not speak, let bun kneel and do horn-&#xD;

At this the fiends on either side of the territle(1&#xD;
hunter, strove to pull' him down; hut Hendrick,&#xD;
aware that by that l)rostrat ion he should yield up his&#xD;
soul to the powers of darkness, resisted with his ut-&#xD;

led with the demons. groaned loudly and wrest-&#xD;
"Show him then," cried the arch-demon, stamp-&#xD;
ing with passion, "show him what he shall become,&#xD;
unless he obeys. Let him see! let him see!-up&#xD;
Wolfgang, up !" continued he, shouting hi(leously.&#xD;
Upon this, the corpse that lay at the foot of the chair&#xD;
started from the floor, and as the black cloth fell&#xD;
from its head, 1-lendrick recognized the pale and&#xD;
bloody corps of his friend Wolfgang. N'he head&#xD;
was resting on the shoulders, but there was a ~leep&#xD;
red gash r9und the neck as if it had been dividedd.&#xD;
"Dost thou know him?" cried the fiend-bride, as&#xD;
she saw her lover tremble involuntarily.&#xD;
"Yes, he knows him," cried the old demon, "and&#xD;
shall be like him, unless he joins in the chase." He&#xD;
then vociferated, "the boarwo If! the boarwo If!" and&#xD;

wound up to a pitch of horror, and struggling vio.&#xD;
gently, be exclaimed, "God and St. Hubert protect&#xD;
me !" The fiends instantly screamed, and let him&#xD;
go, and he sprung through the fire, his only way to&#xD;
escape, and out at the door. In an instant he was&#xD;
on his horse, and in good time, for the whole legion&#xD;
of devils poured out of the cottage, with the boar-&#xD;
wolf at their head.&#xD;
Hendrick dashed his spurs into the sides of his&#xD;
beast, and fled, and the frightful crew followed, fill-&#xD;
ing the air with their vociferations. At every in-&#xD;
stant one or other of the demons seemed on the point&#xD;
of pulling him from his horse; they snatched at him,&#xD;
at his arms, at his neck, at his legs, and at his long&#xD;
flying dress, that floated on the air behind him.&#xD;
They called on him t~ stop; his bride offered t~&#xD;
throw her arms round him, she shrieked in his ':ar~,&#xD;
and blew fire from her mouth, she cursed and revil-&#xD;
ed him. But the huntsrnan still fled, and called on&#xD;
the saints to assist him, till reaching the boundary&#xD;
stream, he leaped his horse over its rapid current,&#xD;
and found himself free from his hateful persecutors.&#xD;
Nevertheless, he checked not his bridle, but kept on&#xD;
his way, till he reached the Village of Fiendenheim,&#xD;
where he rushed in dismay up to a crowd of the in-&#xD;
habitants.&#xD;
The men of Fiendenheim shouted when they saw&#xD;
the successful huntsman, who had ridden forth in the&#xD;
anticipation of happiness, return so terrified, and the&#xD;
women screamed as they gazed on the man and&#xD;
horse, black with smoke, an(l dripping with perspi-&#xD;
ration. "Is this the bridegroom?" cried they.&#xD;
XVhere is the bride?" Hendrick, for a long time&#xD;

&#xD;
could not speak; at length, after drinking a deep&#xD;
and long draught, to clear his throat, he told ~what&#xD;
he had seen. All the hamlet was in agitation. They&#xD;
L&#xD;
ran to the castle of Count Albert, and clamoured to&#xD;
see the head of the boarwolf. The warder called&#xD;
for torches, and led the way into an inner court; but&#xD;
instead of~ the grim Visage of the rapacious monster,&#xD;
they beheld the pale and withered features of Wolf-&#xD;
gang the huntsman, slowly dropping gore, as it&#xD;
stood on the end of a pike. Hendrick fainted, and&#xD;
lay long in a trance, and.when he did recover, he&#xD;
retired into the monastery of St. Hubert, where he&#xD;
shortly died.&#xD;
Ages have passed away since this event is said to&#xD;
have occurred, and generation after generation has&#xD;
sunk into the tomb, but the tradition survives, arid&#xD;
the peasant of Bergstrasse, when he hears the howls&#xD;
of the wolf, redoubled and prolonged by the echoes&#xD;
of his mountains, starts with horror, and recollects&#xD;
the fate of Wolfgang the hunter; and it is still as-&#xD;
serted that, on the anniversary of the fatal night,&#xD;
when he was slain, the boarwolf is seen to run yell~&#xD;
ing amid the hills, pursued by the demons to whom&#xD;
lie so unhappily bound himself.&#xD;

DUMB PROPHETS.&#xD;
&#xD;
IN the Isle of Man, persons born deaf and dumb&#xD;
are frequently the objects of superstitious reverence,&#xD;
so much so, that if a man, labouring under this mis-&#xD;
fortune, walks aboard a vessel, and chalks the mast,&#xD;
not a native sailor will put to sea while the spell is&#xD;
sul)posed to continue. If' dumb men were always&#xD;
good judges of the weather, and were always willing&#xD;
to exert their skill, such a superstition might be very&#xD;
useful; and, at any rate, the reader will regret that&#xD;

MARVi~LL0US REPOSITORY.&#xD;
the following affecting circumstance did not occur in&#xD;
the Isle of Man.&#xD;
During the prevalence of the late tremendous&#xD;
gales, themasters and mates of a number of vessels,&#xD;
which were laid up in a certain harbour, met, and&#xD;
came to the resolution that it would be highly im-&#xD;
p roper to put to sea until the weather moderated.&#xD;
But, in the mean time, the price of coals had risen&#xD;
considerably in the North of Ireland, and the owners&#xD;
of the said vessels were naturally anxious to avail&#xD;
themselves of this favourable turn in the market.&#xD;
Accordingly, several captains were almost com-&#xD;
pelled to put to sea; and, in particulars one poor fel-&#xD;
low, who had long resisted the entreaties of his supe-&#xD;
rior. T~e captain, though no coward, urged that it&#xD;
would bea mere "tempting of Providence," to ven-&#xD;
ture out in such tremendous weather, and that the&#xD;
chances were as fifty to one, that he and all his crew&#xD;
would go to the bottom. Still the owner insisted&#xD;
that there was little danger, and at last offered tQ&#xD;
sail the vessel himself. This argument had the de-&#xD;
sired effect.&#xD;
The (skipper immediately mustered a crew, ~.nd&#xD;
prepared to brave all the dangers of a coasting vy-&#xD;
age. The rashness of the attempt, however, r ~ttu-&#xD;
rally excited a good deal of interest, and ar, the&#xD;
crew dropped dowii to the quay, each with his ittle&#xD;
bundle of necessaries under his arm, it was obs.?rved&#xD;
that all of them were intercepted by a dumb man,&#xD;
who held by their jackets, and screamed, pointed,&#xD;
and gesticulated in a most extraordinary manner.&#xD;
When the captain, in particular, arrived, the poor&#xD;
dumb monitor appeared to be almost frantic with&#xD;
grief, and clung round his body with such force, that&#xD;
it required no slight effort to shake him otE And&#xD;
even after the men had got on board, and were pre~&#xD;
paring to get under weigh, dumby grasped the rope&#xD;
that connected the vessel with the shore, and at-&#xD;
tempted to oppose, by his own exertions~ the united&#xD;
strength of the whole crew: and when bafll~.d in&#xD;
&#xD;
ABBE OP CALVADOS.&#xD;
his last attempt, he uttered two or three most pierce&#xD;
[     ing yells, and continued counting his fingers till the&#xD;
vessel was out of sight.&#xD;
He then slowly withdrew, pausing at intervals to&#xD;
look back on the ocean, and leaving the spectators a&#xD;
good deal astonished at this unlocked for interfer-&#xD;
ence on the part of a stranger, whom they h~d never&#xD;
seen before, and have never heard of since.&#xD;
*      The sea ran mountains high, and as the night ap-&#xD;
proached, the storm raged with tenfold fury. Of&#xD;
course the most serious apprehensions were enter-&#xD;
tamed for the safety of the ship, and in the course&#xD;
*    of a few posts, the news arrive(l that the&#xD;
after being a t'ew hours at sea, had struck on a reef&#xD;
*    of rocks, where the whole of the crew perished,&#xD;
with the exception of one man.&#xD;
This intelligtmce, which was unhappily soon con-&#xD;
firmed, spread a deep gloom over the port, from&#xD;
whence the vessel sailed, and the superstitious al-&#xD;
leged that the dumb man wasfey, and had foretold,&#xD;
by the counting of his fingers, the exact time that&#xD;
the vessel would live, before being swallowed up by&#xD;
the waves.&#xD;
TIlE ABBE OF CALVADOS.&#xD;
IN a village of Calvados, in the month of October,&#xD;
1820, was burned an old man, who had retired from&#xD;
business, and owned some national property. Be-&#xD;
fore his death, he was desirous of receiving the sacra-&#xD;
rnent, and the priest gave him absolution, on condi-&#xD;
tion that he would restore some acres to the church,&#xD;
*   which he I)romised to do; but death came before the&#xD;
flOtarv.-...~His property, therefore, wholly descended&#xD;
to bis~ son, a simple youth. On the night after his&#xD;
father's funeral, the young man was awakened by a&#xD;
Violent noise, accompanied with a vivid light, which&#xD;
*'n a moment disappeared. Being no stranger to&#xD;
fear, he shook as he lay in his bed, and tried to call&#xD;

that he beheld a spectre~ covered with a long white&#xD;
mantle, pass before him~ and in a sepulchral voice&#xD;
uttered these words: " Badly obtained The soul of&#xD;

tinned: "JlIy son, restore the ill-gotten properlY~ or&#xD;

night after night to drag you by your .feet ." These&#xD;
words were followed by total silence the youth slept&#xD;
no more; and the next morning he went to relate to&#xD;
the priest and his family the vision of the night.&#xD;
The priest and some of the neighbours advised him&#xD;
to give up his property; but a young kinsman, lust&#xD;
conYe from school, maintained jhat the dead do not&#xD;
come back again, and that the possessors of national&#xD;
property are no more likely to have their feet drag-&#xD;
ged by ghosts than their nei~hboiirs rrhen taking&#xD;
the young heir aside, he offered to lie in the bed in&#xD;
his place, if he would keep it a secret, and would&#xD;
promise to wait one day more before he gave up the&#xD;
property. This proposal was accepted, and the&#xD;
young kinsman took possesSion of the other youth's&#xD;
bed for that night. Between twelve and one o'clock,&#xD;
he heard some person gently open the window, and&#xD;
at the same time beheld a phantom enter, who caine&#xD;
up as if to speak to him with a threatening gesture.&#xD;
"So farso good;" said he, mentally, "as he in's&#xD;
takes me for another persofl~ spirits are not 0mm-&#xD;
scient." lie then slipped out of bed as quietly as&#xD;
he could, seized the phantom with both his hands,&#xD;
and threw him in a moment into a little dark closet,&#xD;
which he shut and locked very carefully. The&#xD;
spectre finding himself a prisoner~ began to cry eut&#xD;
for mercy; but the youth went to call in his neigh&#xD;
hours, who soon re6o~n1Sed, in the semblance of a&#xD;
ghost, a young abbe, who, although as yet only in&#xD;

let those account for it who can. I shall relate what&#xD;
I saw, as nearly as I can recollect, and it was not a&#xD;

On the banks of this Loch-Rog there stands a con-&#xD;

Lord Seaforth, and lets it off again to numberless&#xD;
small tenants. Between his house and the village&#xD;
there lies a straight green lane, and above the house,&#xD;
on a rising ground, sta~pd a great number of tall&#xD;
stones, that have been raised in some early age, and&#xD;
appear at a distance like an army of tremendous&#xD;
giants. One day a party of seven, from on board the&#xD;
Swallow, was invited to dine with this gentleman.&#xD;
We went out a shooting all the forenoon, and tow&#xD;
ards evening, on our return, we found all the family&#xD;
in the most dreadful alarm, on account of something&#xD;
that an old maiden lady had seen, which they called&#xD;
Faileas More; (the great shadow,) and which they&#xD;
alleged was the herald of terrible things, and the&#xD;
most dismal calamities. The villagers were like-&#xD;
wise made acquainted with it, and they were run-&#xD;
ning howling about in consternation.&#xD;
The family consisted of an old man and his sister;&#xD;
a young man and his wife, and two children: the&#xD;
old man and the two ladies believed the matter&#xD;
throughout, but the young man pretended with us&#xD;
to laugh at it, though I could see he was deeply con~&#xD;
earned at what we had heard. The vision iv~s de-&#xD;

that same place the next morning, at the same degree&#xD;
of lightness, a whole troop of ghosts arise, and with&#xD;
Mac Torcill Dhu (Black M'Torquille) at their&#xD;
head, walk in procession to the standing stones, and&#xD;
there hide themselves again in their ancient graves&#xD;

As the one part of this story remained to be prov-&#xD;
ed, every one of us determined to watch, and see if'&#xD;
there was any resemblance of such a thing. But&#xD;
the most extraordinary circumstance attending it&#xD;
was, that it could only be seen from the upper win*&#xD;
dows of that house, or from the same height~ in the&#xD;
air, a small space to the eastward of that; and that&#xD;
from no other point on the whole island had it ever&#xD;
been discovered that either~ of the visions bad been&#xD;
seen.&#xD;
We testified some doubts that the morning might&#xD;
not prove clear, but the old mah, and the ol~ maid-&#xD;
en lady, both assured us that it would be clear, as&#xD;
the morning of M'Torquille's Visit never was known&#xD;
to be otherwise. Some of u~ went to bed with our&#xD;
clothes on, but others sat up all night, and at an&#xD;
early hour we were all sitting at the windows, weary-&#xD;
ing for the br'~ak of day. The morning at length&#xD;
broke, and was perfectly clear and serene, as had&#xD;
been predicted. Every eye was strained toward the&#xD;
spot where the Great Slirzde had vanished, and at&#xD;
length the young gentleman of the house said, in a&#xD;
tone expressing great awe, "Yonder they are now."&#xD;
I could not discern any thing for the space of a few&#xD;
seconds, but at length, on looking very narrowly&#xD;
toward the spot, I thought I perceived something&#xD;
like a broad shadow on the shore and, on straining&#xD;
my sight a little more, it really did appear as if di-&#xD;
vided into small columns like the forms of men. It&#xD;
did not appear like a cloud, but rather like the&#xD;
shadow of a cloud; yet there was not the slightest&#xD;
cloud or vapour to be seen floating in the firmament.&#xD;
We lost sight of it for a very short space, and then&#xD;
beheld it again coming over the heath, above the&#xD;
rocks that overhung the shore, The vison was still&#xD;
very indistinct, but yet it had the appearance of a&#xD;
troop of warriors dressed in greenish tartans with a&#xD;
tinge of red. The headland where the apparition&#xD;
arose, was distant from us about half a mile,-..&#xD;
they appeared to be moving remarkably slow, yet&#xD;

notwithstandingg of' that, they were close upon us al-&#xD;
most instantly. We were told that they would pass&#xD;
in array immediately before the windows, along the&#xD;
green lane, between US and the hack of the village;&#xD;
and seeing that they actually approached in that di-&#xD;
rection, Dr. Scott, a rough, rash, intrepid fellow,&#xD;
propose~1 that we should fire at them. I ohjecte(l to&#xD;
it. (leeming that it was a trick, and that they were&#xD;
all fellow creatures; for we saw them now as dis-&#xD;
tinctly as we could see any body of' men in the gray&#xD;
of the morning. r1~l~e young man however, assuring&#xD;
us that it was nothing human that we saw, I agreed&#xD;
to the proposal; and as they passed in array jinme-&#xD;
diately before the windows, we pointed a~l the 01~bt&#xD;
loaded muskets directly at them, and fired on this&#xD;
mysterious troop all at 0 rice: but not One of them&#xD;
paused or turned round his head. They all of them&#xD;
held on with the same solemn and ghostlike move-&#xD;
ment, still continuing in appearanCe~ to be walking&#xD;
very slow, yet some way they went Qver the gro~ind&#xD;
with unaccountable celerity; and when they ap-&#xD;
proached near to the group of tall obelisks, they&#xD;
rushed in amongst them, and we saw no more, save&#xD;
a reeling flicker of light that seemed to tremble&#xD;
through the stones for a moment.&#xD;
They appeared to be a troop of warriors, with&#xD;
plaids and helmets, each having a broad targe on&#xD;
his arm, and a long black lance in the other hand;&#xD;
and they were led on by a tall figure in black ar-&#xD;
mour, that walked considerably ahead of the rest.-&#xD;
Some of our people protested that they saw, the bare&#xD;
skulls below the helmets, with empty eye~socketS~&#xD;
and the nose and lips wanting; but I saw nothing&#xD;
like this. They appeared to me exactly like other&#xD;
men; but the truth is, that I never saw them very&#xD;
(Iistinctly, for they were but a short time near us,&#xD;
and during that time, the smoke issuing from the&#xD;
muskets intervene(l, and owing to the dead calm of&#xD;
the morning, made us see them much worse. All&#xD;
the people of the village were hid in groups within~&#xD;
64&#xD;
&#xD;
doors, and engaged in some rite which I did not wit-&#xD;
ness, and cannot describe; but they took great um~&#xD;
bra o'e at our audacity in firing at their unearthly&#xD;
visiters, and I believe there was not one among us,&#xD;
not even the regardless Dr. Scott, who was not&#xD;
shocked a~ what had heen done.&#xD;
[make no pretensions to account for this extraor-&#xD;
dinary l)henomenon, but the singular circumstance&#xD;
of its being visible only from one point, and no other,&#xD;
makes it look like something that might be account-&#xD;
ed for. I can well excuse any who do not believe it,&#xD;
for if I had not seen it with my own eyes, I never&#xD;
would have believed it. But of all things I ever l)e-&#xD;
held, for wild sublimity, the march of that troop of&#xD;
apparitions excelled-not a day or a night hath yet&#xD;
passed over my head, on which I have iiot thought&#xD;
with wonder and awe on the Visit of 31'Torqui'ie.&#xD;
From that time forth, as long as I remained in&#xD;
Lewis, I considered myself in the country of the ge-&#xD;
nii, an(1 surrounded with spiritual beings, that were&#xD;
to         in some          rm at my si(le,&#xD;
ready   start up         bodily fo&#xD;
whenever they bad a mind. Such influence had the&#xD;
vision that I had seen over my mind, and so far was&#xD;
it beyond my comureh~nsi one&#xD;
on, that I grew like&#xD;
half crazed about spirits, an#could think or speak&#xD;
about nothing else. For a whole week I lingered&#xD;
about the shores to see the mermaid; for I was as-&#xD;
sured by the people, that they were very frequently&#xD;
to be seen, though they confessed that the male as&#xD;
often appeared as the female. They regarded her&#xD;
as a kind of sea-spirit, and ominc~, in no ordinary&#xD;
degree, to the boatmen and fishers, but yet they con-&#xD;
fessed that she was flesh and blood, like other crea-&#xD;
tures, and that she had long hair, and a face and bo-&#xD;
som so beautiful, that their lan~ua~e had no words&#xD;
to describe them. I was actually in love with them,&#xD;
.tnd watched the creeks as anxiously as ever a lover&#xD;
~id his mistress' casement; and often when I saw&#xD;
the seals flouncing on the rocks at a distance, I&#xD;
painted them to myself as the most delicate and&#xD;

beautiful mermaids, but on coming near them, was&#xD;
always disappointed, and shocked at the ugly dog's&#xD;
heads that they set up to me; so that after all, I was&#xD;
obliged to give up my search after mermaids.&#xD;
They told me of one that fell in love with a young&#xD;
man, named Alexander M'Leod, who often met her&#xD;
upon the shore, at a certain place which they showed&#xD;
me, and had amorous dalliance with her; but he&#xD;
soon fell sick and died, and when she came to the&#xD;
shore, and could no more find him, she cried one&#xD;
while, and sung another,- in the roost plaintive&#xD;
strains that ever were heard. This was the popular&#xD;
account; but there was an old man told me, who&#xD;
heard her one evening, and watched her, from a&#xD;
concealment close beside her, all the time she was&#xD;
(in shore, that she made a slight humming noise,&#xD;
like that made by a kid, not when it bleats out, but&#xD;
when it is looking round for its dam, and bleating&#xD;
with its mouth shut; and this was all the sound that&#xD;
she made, or that he believed she was able to make.&#xD;
I asked why he did not go to her? but he answered&#xD;
in his own language, that he would not have gone to&#xD;
her for all the lands of the Mackenzie.&#xD;
M'Leo(l, when on his, death-bed, told his friends&#xD;
of all that had passe~between them, and previously&#xD;
regretted having met with her. He said, they never&#xD;
met but she clasped her arms around him, and wish-&#xD;
ed to take him into the sea; I)ut that it was from no&#xD;
evil intent, but out of affection, thinking that he&#xD;
could not live more than she, if left upon dry lana.&#xD;
When asked if he loved her; he said that she was so&#xD;
beautiful he could not but love her, and would have&#xD;
loved her much better if she had not been so cold;&#xD;
but he added, that he believed she was a wicked&#xD;
creature. If the young man could imagine all this&#xD;
without any foundation, people may imagine after&#xD;
what they fist; for my part, I believed every word of&#xD;
it, though disappointed of meeting with her&#xD;

and lake, of whom many frightful stories were told&#xD;
me; but in my next attempt at an intercourse with&#xD;
the spirits that inhabit that dreary country, I had all&#xD;
the success that I could desire.&#xD;
I was told of an old woman who lived in a lone&#xD;
shieling, at the head of an arm of the sea,, called&#xD;
Loch Kios, to whom a ghost paid a vi2it every night.&#xD;
I determined to see the place, and tarry a night with&#xD;
the old woman, if possible. Accordir~gly, I travelled&#xD;
across the country by a wild and pathless route, and&#xD;
came to her hot hy at the fall of night, and going in,&#xD;
I sat down, feigning to he very weary, and unable to&#xD;
move farther. We did not understand a word of&#xD;
each other's language, and consequently no conver~&#xD;
nation, save by signs, could pass between us. I&#xD;
round a miserable old shriveled creature, rather&#xD;
neatly dressed for that country, but manifestly de-&#xD;
ranged somewhat in her intellects.&#xD;
Before I entered, I heard her singing some coro-&#xD;
riach or dirge, and when I went in, I found her en-&#xD;
deavouring to mend an old mantle, and singing&#xD;
away in a wild unearthly croon; so intent was she&#xD;
on both, that she scarcely lifted her eyes from her&#xD;
work when I went towards her, and when she did,&#xD;
it was not to me that she looked, but to the hole in&#xD;
the roof, or to the door by which I entered. The&#xD;
sight affected me very much, and in all things that&#xD;

was not with any symptoms of fear or displeasure&#xD;

The story that prevailed of her was, that being&#xD;

young man; but going -~t to the fishing once, with&#xD;
some associates to the Saints' Islands, he never re-&#xD;
(iirned, and there were suSpiCiOnS that he had been&#xD;
fully murdered~ by his companions, the weather&#xD;
having been so mild that no accident could have&#xD;
been 5u1)posed to have happened at sea. There&#xD;
were besides many suspicious. circumstances attend-&#xD;
ing it, but no ~roo~ could be led. However, the&#xD;
woman hearing that she had lost her darling son,&#xD;
and only stay on earth, set no bounds to her grief,&#xD;
hut raved and prayed, and called upon his name;&#xD;
conjuring him by every thing sacred to appear to&#xD;
her, and tell her if he was happy, and all that had&#xD;
befallen him. These continued conjurations at&#xD;
length moved the dead to return. The spirit of her&#xD;
son appeared to her every night, at midnight, and&#xD;
m~nversed with her about the most mysterious things&#xD;
--about things of life and death-the fates of king..&#xD;
doms and of men; and of the world that is beyond&#xD;
the grave-sb e was happy in the communion, and&#xD;
abstracted from all things.in this world beside.&#xD;
Such was the unearthly tale that was told in the&#xD;
country of this rueful old creature, and made me re~&#xD;
solve to visit her before I left the island; but I could&#xD;
not procure a man in all the district of Uig to ac-&#xD;
company me that could speak both languages; for,&#xD;
except the minister ~nd his wife and one taxman&#xD;
and his family, there was not one in the district,&#xD;
which contained 3000 inhabitants, that could speak&#xD;
the English language, or were book-learned. I pro~&#xD;
cured a young lad to be my guide, named Malcolm&#xD;
Morison, but he having gathered something of my&#xD;
intentions before we left the banks '~f Loch Rog,&#xD;
would, on no consideration, accompany me into the&#xD;
cot, but left me as soon as we came in sight of it. I&#xD;
no sooner beheld the object of my curiosity, than I&#xD;
thought her c ra~y, and that the story might have&#xD;
arisen from her ravings. Still she was an interest-&#xD;
ing object to contemplate; and resolving ~o do so for&#xD;
the night, I tried by signs to make her understand that&#xD;
6S&#xD;
&#xD;
~~as a traveller fatigued with walking, and wished&#xD;
to repose myself in her cottage until ne~ct morning;&#xD;
but she regarded me no more than she would have&#xD;
done a strayed cat or dog, that had coi~ie in to take&#xD;
shelter with her. There was one sentence which&#xD;
she often repeated, which I afterwards understood&#xD;
to be of the following import: "God shield the poor&#xD;
weary Saxon;" but I do not know how to spell it in&#xD;
Earse. I could likewise perceive, that for all the&#xD;
intentness with which she was mending the mantle,&#xD;
she was coming no speed, but was wasting the cloth,&#xD;
endeavouring to shape a piece suiting to the rent,&#xD;
which she was still making rather worse than better.&#xD;
It was quite visible that either she had no mind, or&#xD;
that it was engaged in something widely different&#xD;
from that at which her hands were employed.&#xD;
She did not offer me any victuals, nor did she take&#xD;
any herself, but sat shaping and sewing, and always&#xD;
between hands singing slow melancholy airs, hav-&#xD;
ing all the wildness of the native airs of that wild&#xD;
and primitive people. Those that she crooned were&#xD;
of a solemn and mourn f~il cast, and seemed to affect&#xD;
her at times very deeply.&#xD;
Night came on, and still she gave herself no con-&#xD;
cern at all about me. She made no signs to me&#xD;
either to lie down and rest in the only couch the&#xD;
hovel contained, or to remain, or to go away. The&#xD;
fire sent forth a good (leal of smoke, but neither light&#xD;
nor heat; at length, with much delay and fumbling,&#xD;
she put some white shreds of moss into a cruise of&#xD;
oil, and kindled it. 'I'his threw a feeble ray of light&#xD;
through the smoke, not much stronger than the&#xD;
light of a glow worm, making darkness scarcely visi-&#xD;
ble, if I may use the expression.&#xD;
Th~ woman, who was seated on a dry sod at the&#xD;
side of the fire, not more than a foot from the ground,&#xD;
crossed her arms upon her knees, and laying hem&#xD;
head on them, fell fast asleep. I wrapt myself in&#xD;
my officer'~ cloak, and threw myself down on the&#xD;
moss couch, laying myself in such a position that I&#xD;

could watch all her motions as well as 'looks About&#xD;
eleven o'clock she awoke, and sat for some time&#xD;
moaning like one about to expire; she then kneeled&#xD;
on the sod seat, and muttered some words, waving&#xD;
her withered arms, and stretching them upward,&#xD;
apparently performing some rite, either of necro-~&#xD;
mancy or devotion, which she concluded by utter~&#xD;
ing three or four feeble howls.&#xD;
When she was again seated I watched her fea~&#xD;
tures and looks, and certainly never before saw any&#xD;
thing more unearthly. The haggard wildness of&#xD;
her features; the anxious and fearful way in which&#xD;
she looked ab'mt and about, as if looking for one&#xD;
that she missed away, made such an impression on&#xD;
me, that my hairs stood all on end, a feeling that I&#xD;
never experienced before, for I had always been&#xD;
proof against superstitious terrors. But here I could&#xD;
not get the better of them, and wished myself any&#xD;
where else. The dim lamp, shining amidst smoke&#xD;
and darkness, made her features appear as if they&#xD;
had been a dull yellow, and she was altogether rath~&#xD;
er like a ghastly shade bf something that had once&#xD;
been mortal, than any thing connected with hu-&#xD;
manity~&#xD;
It was apl)arent from her looks that she expected&#xD;
some one to visit her, and I became firmly persua&amp;amp;&#xD;
ed that I should see a ghost, and hear one speak. I&#xD;
was not afraid of any individual of my own species;&#xD;
for, though I had taken good care to conceal them&#xD;
from her for fear of creating alarm, I had two loaded&#xD;
pistols and a short sword under my cloak; and as no&#xD;
one could enter without passing my couch by a very&#xD;
narrow entrance, I was sure to distinguish who or&#xD;
what it was&#xD;
I had quitted keeping my eyes upon the woman,&#xD;
and was watching the door, from which I thought I&#xD;
could distinguish voices- I watched still more in.&#xD;
tensely; but hearing that the sounds came from the&#xD;
other side, I moved my head slowly round, and saw,&#xD;
apparently, the corpse of her son sitting directly op-&#xD;

posite to her. The figure was dressed in dead..&#xD;
clothes; that is, it was wrapt in a coarse white sheet,&#xD;
and had a napkin of the same colour round its head.&#xD;
This was raised up on the brow, as if thrust up re~&#xD;
gently with the hand, discovering the pale steadfast&#xD;
features, that neither moved eyelid nor lip, though it&#xD;
spoke in an audible voice again and again. The face&#xD;
was not only pale, but there was a clear glazed white~&#xD;
ness upon it, on which the rays of the lamp falling,&#xD;
showed a sight that could not be looked on without&#xD;
horror. The winding sheet fell likewise aside, at&#xD;
the knee, and I saw the bare feet and legs of the&#xD;
same bleached hue. The old woman's arms were&#xD;
stretched out towards the figure, and her face thrown&#xD;
upwards, the features, meanwhile, distorted as with&#xD;
ecstatic agony. My senses now became so bewil..&#xD;
dered, that I fell into a stupor, like a trance, without&#xD;
p     being able to move either hand or foot. I know not&#xD;
how long the apparition staid; for the next thing&#xD;
that I remember was being reluctantly awakened&#xD;
from my trance by a feeble cry, which I heard&#xD;
through my slumber repeated several times. I look..&#xD;
ed, and saw that the old miserable creature had fall-&#xD;
en on her face, and was grasping, in feeble convul..&#xD;
sions the seat where the figure of her dead son had&#xD;
so lately reclined. My compassion overcame my&#xD;
terror; for she seemed on the last verge of life, or rath&#xD;
er sliding helplessly from time's slippery precipice,&#xD;
after the thread of existence, by which she&#xD;
hurnr.&#xD;
bad given way. I lifted her up, and found that a I&#xD;
her sufferings were over-the joints were grown&#xD;
supple, and the cold damps of death had settled on&#xD;
her hands and brow. I carried her to the bed from&#xD;
which I had risen, and could scarcely believe that I&#xD;
carried a human body-it being not much heavier&#xD;
than a suit of clothes. After I had laid her down, I&#xD;
brought the lamp near, to see if there was any hope&#xD;
of renovation...she was liVing, but that was all, and,&#xD;
with a resigned, though ghastly smile, and a shak&#xD;
Ing of the head, she expired.&#xD;

I did not know what to do; for the night was dark&#xD;
as pitch; and I w'ist not where to fly, knowing the&#xD;
cot to be surrounded by precipitous shores, torrents,&#xD;
and winding bays of the sea; therefore, all chance of&#xD;
escape until daylight was utterly impossible; so I re-&#xD;
solved to trim the lamp, and keep my place, hoping&#xD;
it would not be long till day.&#xD;
I suppose that I sat about an hour in this dismal&#xD;
place, without moving or changing my attitude, with&#xD;
my brow leaning upon both my hands, and my eyes&#xD;
shut, when 1 w~s aroused by hearing a rustling in&#xD;
the bed where .the body lay. On looking round,&#xD;
I perceived with horror, that the corpse was sitting&#xD;
upright in the bed, shaking its head as it did in the&#xD;
agonies of death, and stretching out its hands&#xD;
towards the hearth. I thought the woman had been&#xD;
vivified, and looked steadily at th~ face, but I saw&#xD;
that it was the face of a corpse still, for the eye was&#xD;
white, being turned upward, and fixed in the socket.&#xD;
the mouth was open, and all the other features im-&#xD;
moveably fixed forever. Seeing that it continued&#xD;
the same motion, I~lifted the lamp and looked fear~&#xD;
fully round, and there beheld the figure I had so re~&#xD;
cently seen, sitting on the same seat, in the same at~&#xD;
titude, only having its face turned toward the bed.&#xD;
I could stand this no longer, but fled, stumbling&#xD;
out at the door, and ran straight forward. I soon&#xD;
found myself by the sea, and it being ebb tide, I fled&#xD;
along the shore, like a deer pursued by the hounds.&#xD;
It was not long till the beach terminated, and I came&#xD;
to an abrupt precipice washed by the sea. I climbed&#xD;
over a ridge on my hands and knees, and found that&#xD;
I was on~ a rocky point between two narrow friths,&#xD;
and farther progress impracticable.&#xD;
I had now no choice left me; so, wrapping myself&#xD;
in my cloak, I threw me down in a bush of heath,&#xD;
below an overhanging cliff, and gave up my whole&#xD;
mind to amazement at what I had witnessed. As~&#xD;
ton ished as I was, nature yielded to fatigue, and I&#xD;
fell into a sound sleep, from which I did not awake&#xD;
72&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
till about the rising of the sun. The scene al4&#xD;
around me was frightfully wild a~nd rugged,~and I&#xD;
scarce could persuade myself that I was awake,&#xD;
thinking that I was still struggling with a dreadful&#xD;
dream. One would think this was a matter easily&#xD;
settled, but I remember well, it was not so with me,&#xD;
that morning. I pulled heath, cut some parts of it&#xD;
off; and chewed them in my mouth;-rose,-----walked&#xD;
about, and threw stones into the sea, and still had&#xD;
strong suspicions that I was in a dream.-The ad..&#xD;
venturesofthe preceding night dawned on myre-&#xD;
collection one by one, but these I regarded all as a&#xD;
dream for certain; and it may well be deemed not a&#xD;
little extraordinary, that to this day, if my oath&#xD;
were taken, I declare I could not tell whether I saw&#xD;
these things in a dream, or in reality. My own be&#xD;
lief leaned to, the former, but every circumstance&#xD;
rather tended to confirm the latter; else, how came I&#xD;
to be in the place where I was.&#xD;
I scrambled up among the rocks to the westward&#xD;
and at length came to a small footpath, which led&#xD;
from the head of one bay to the other; and following&#xD;
that, it soon brought me to a straggling hamlet, call-&#xD;
ed, I think, Battaline. Here I found a man that&#xD;
had been a soldier, and had a little broken English,&#xD;
*    and, by his help, I raised the inhabitants of the vil-&#xD;
lage; and getting into a fishing boat, we were soon&#xD;
at the cottage. There we found the body lying&#xD;
stretched, cold and stiff, exactly in the very place&#xD;
and the very position in which [laid it at first on the&#xD;
bed. The house was searched, and, previous to re-&#xD;
late, there was no article either of meat, drink, or&#xD;
clothing in it, save the old mantle which I found her&#xD;
mending the evening beibre. It appeared to me on&#xD;
reflection, that it had been a settled matter between&#xD;
her and the spirit, that she was to yield up her frail&#xD;
life that night, and join his company; and that I had&#xD;
fc~und her preparing for her change.-The cloak she&#xD;
had meant for her winding.sheet, having nothing&#xD;
else; and by her little hymns and orgies she had&#xD;

I have related this story exactly as I remember it.&#xD;
It is possible that the whole might have been a&#xD;

have played wonderful pranks in my sleep: but I&#xD;
think the circumstance of the corpse being found in&#xD;
the very way in which I had laid it, or, at least sup-&#xD;

real, and part of it a dream, for the whole, from the&#xD;

marriage of Charles It., the king arid queen being&#xD;
entertained at Burleigh, little Jeffery was served&#xD;
up to table in a cold pie, and presented by the&#xD;
duchess to the queen, who kept him as her dwarf.&#xD;
From sex-ei~ years of age till thirty, he never grew&#xD;
taller; but after thirty, he shot up to three feet nine&#xD;
inches, and there fixed. Jeffery took a considera-&#xD;
Me part in the eM ertainments of the court. Sir&#xD;
William Davenant wrote a poem, called "JeftVei-&#xD;

and in 1633 was published a very small book, called&#xD;
"The New Year's Gift," presented at court, from&#xD;
the lady Perceval to the Lord Minimus (commonly&#xD;
called little Jeffery,) her majesty's servant, &amp;amp;e&#xD;
written by Mierophilus; with a little print of Jeth~-&#xD;

on his return with this gentlewoman, and her majes-&#xD;

queen, from her mother, Mary (IC Medicis, he was&#xD;
taken by the Dunkirkers. Jeffery, thus made of&#xD;

A young gentleman, by the name of C-., was,&#xD;
some years ago, residing with a clergyman isi the&#xD;
north of England, for the purpose of completing his&#xD;
education. He was heir to a large fortune, particu-&#xD;
larly amiahh~, of a lively disposition, gay in his man-&#xD;
ners, and entirely free from any taint of supersti-&#xD;
tious belief. He was strong and healthy, and very&#xD;
unlikely, in any manner, to give credit to the work-&#xD;
ings of his imagination, or to believein dreams. I&#xD;
mention this, because there are some people whose&#xD;
weak state of health, or whose melancholy disposi-&#xD;
tion might make them more liable to be exposed to&#xD;
the impression. produced by any sudden alarm, or&#xD;
any unusual agitation. One morning, however, at&#xD;
breakfast, his haggard and pale looks, and his&#xD;
thoughtful manner, attracted the attention of his&#xD;
friends, who were accustomed to se~ him animated&#xD;
*   and healthy, and upon their pressing~hiin to account&#xD;
for this sudden alteration, he confessed that he had,&#xD;
during the night, had a dream, which had riiade so&#xD;
strong an impression upon him, that he could not&#xD;
drive it from his thoughts. He said, that he had&#xD;
seen a young woman enter his room softly, with a&#xD;
light in one hand, and a knife in the other;.that she&#xD;
made several attempts to stab him, but upon his re-&#xD;
sistance, she had disappeared. He then described&#xD;
her person and dress, both of which, he said, were&#xD;
so deeply impressed upon his memory, that they&#xD;
never could he effiiced.&#xD;
His friends treated the matter lightly, and endea-&#xD;
voured to ridicule him for giving so much CrC(Iit to&#xD;
a dream; and Mr. C himn~elf. as if ashamed of&#xD;
his weakness, tried to banish it from his thoughts.&#xD;
Several months passed away, and he resumed his&#xD;
usual gaiety of manner; every thing appeared for-&#xD;
gotten; and when his dream intruded itself upon his&#xD;
recollection, he laughed at himself for having ever&#xD;

The young Valtenville had been only a month in&#xD;
Paris when he was suddenly taken ill, and (lied.&#xD;
his abode had been at a tavern ; and his corpse was&#xD;
laid forth on the bed in which he had been accustom-&#xD;
ed to sleep.&#xD;
In the evening, after his deceased, a couple of Ger-&#xD;
man gentlemen, who were in the habit of frequent-&#xD;
ing the house, arrived about the hour of 'going to&#xD;
bed, and asked for lodging. The landlady replied,&#xD;
that she was extremely sorry to inform them, that&#xD;
she had at that time, but one chamber unoccupied,&#xD;
and that in it there was only one bed.&#xD;
It was already very late; and the Germans an-&#xD;
swered~ that rather than go to another house, they&#xD;
would, for that one night, (and their stay would be&#xD;
no longer,) put up with such accommodation as she&#xD;
could give them.&#xD;
This arrangement being made, one of the Ger-&#xD;
mans, who was fatigued with travelling, inimedi-&#xD;
ately went to bed, the other remained below, chat-&#xD;
ting with his landlady's daughter: at length, being&#xD;

inclined to retire to rest, he took his candle and&#xD;
went up stairs; for he was, in his own opinion, so&#xD;
well acquainte~l with the house, by having very fre-&#xD;
quently visited I~, that he did not require the assist&#xD;
ance of a chamber maid, to poiut out his chamber to&#xD;
him. His knowledge, however, was not quite so&#xD;
correct as he believed it; for, instead of entering the&#xD;
chamber where his friend slept, he turned into that&#xD;
which contained the body of young Yaltenvifle; un-&#xD;
dre~sed himself and went to bed. It was scarcely&#xD;
day when the German was awakened by a noise in&#xD;
his chamber, which was caused by the entrance of a&#xD;
servant of the house, who was introducing a carpen-&#xD;
ter, for th&amp;amp; purpose of i~nea~uring the (leceased for&#xD;
his coffin. The German started up in his bed at the&#xD;
sqund; and the carpenter and servant, not doubting&#xD;
that the dead man was come to life, ran screaming&#xD;
down stairs with all The precipitancy they were&#xD;
able.&#xD;
r1~he German now turning round his eyes, beheld&#xD;
what kind of a companion he had gdt, and jumping&#xD;
out of bed, went into his friend's chamber and begf&#xD;
ged to take part of his bed. "If you are resolute in&#xD;
getting into it," replied his friend, "I shall get out;&#xD;
do you think I'll sleep with abed-fellow who has&#xD;
been lying with a corpse? It has been a very warm&#xD;
night; I'll takea turn in the gallery to cool myself,&#xD;
and then put on my clothes.&#xD;
Into the gallery, accordingly he sallied; and loud&#xD;
shrieks saluted his ears on every side. With the&#xD;
- cause of them he' was unacquainted; but the fact&#xD;
was this; some of the other servants who were pos-&#xD;
sessed of more courage than she who had been the&#xD;
conductress of the carpenter to the dead man's cham-&#xD;
ber, having heard of their alarm, were coming up to&#xD;
satisfy themselves of the truth of what they heard&#xD;
reported, and seeing a man walking along the gal-&#xD;
lery in his shirt, entertained no doubt of its being&#xD;
young Valtenville himself, and ran away from the&#xD;
sight as speedily as their companions had done.&#xD;

&#xD;
THE GHOST.&#xD;
&#xD;
A few hours after, the two Germans breakfasted&#xD;
and departedd.&#xD;
The banker, on whom the Marquis ofValtenville,&#xD;
had given his son letters of credit, was a gentleman&#xD;
who had once been his neighbour in Picardy, and to&#xD;
whom young Valtenville had been well known; his&#xD;
name was Dubois.&#xD;
Montrieul, ignorant of all that had passed at the&#xD;
inn, having arranged matters for his friend's funeral,&#xD;
took his pocket-book, which he found in his trunk,&#xD;
and went to settle his account with Mr. Duhois, in&#xD;
order that he might remit it to his father. On en-&#xD;
tering the house, he informed the banker what was&#xD;
the occasion of his calling upon him; and Mr. Dii-&#xD;
hois, putting on his spectacles, in order to gain a&#xD;
better view of his person, said, "Ah, young man,&#xD;
you are playing me a trick. The son of the Marquis&#xD;
of Valtenville dead! No, no! you are his son your-&#xD;
self; I know your person ~vell."&#xD;
"Indeed, sir, it is as 1 inform you," replied Mon-&#xD;
trienl, "I am only his friend; but we have always&#xD;
been reckoned very much alike."&#xD;
The banker still continued his laugh. "Your fa-&#xD;
ther was always fond of a joke," he said, "and you&#xD;
inherit his propensity. Will you drink a glass of&#xD;
wine to your father's health?"&#xD;
"No, thank you, sir," replied Montricul. "As&#xD;
you insist on my being Valtenville, I am undoubt~.&#xD;
edly a dead man; I never heard of a dead man drink~-&#xD;
Ang wine, and therefore, I am compelled to refuse&#xD;
your invItation."&#xD;
The hanker, however, could not be argued out of&#xD;
his opinion. rI~hey settled their business; and Mon~&#xD;
trieu.i departed. No sooner was he gone, than Ma.&#xD;
dame Dubois, bursting in to the room to her husband,&#xD;
exclaimed, "XWhy, my dear, I am terrified out of my&#xD;
senses; you have had a visit from a ghost."&#xD;
"A ghost !" echoed her husband.&#xD;
"Yes, indeed," she returned. " I forgot to tell&#xD;

yule was dead. Oh, yes, it was his ghost that was&#xD;
here just now, you may depend upon it; and I'll not&#xD;
lure in a house, that a ghost has entered, another&#xD;
day."&#xD;
Madame Dubois, was, according to the old saying,&#xD;
"~the grey mare;" and she insisted on her husband&#xD;
going directly to the inn where the young man bad&#xD;
lodged, to inquire whether he xVere really dead or&#xD;
not.&#xD;
Away went Mr. Dubois to the inn, and begged to&#xD;
speak with the landlady. " Pray, Ma'am," said he,&#xD;
"does a young gentleman, named Valtenville, lodge&#xD;
in your house?"&#xD;
He did lodge here, Sir," she answered, "but he&#xD;
is dead and buried."&#xD;
"Very extraordinary this," exclaimed Mr. Du-&#xD;
bois.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, it is extraordinary, indeed, if you knew&#xD;
all," rejoined the landlady. "When he was going&#xD;
to be measured for his coffin, he jumped up in his&#xD;
bed, and frightened my servant and the carpenter&#xD;
out of their senses; an~ after that, he was seen by&#xD;
some more of my family, walking about the gallery;&#xD;
and I intend to quit u~iy house directly on the ac-&#xD;
count."&#xD;
Mr. Dubois returned horne~ arid threw himself.&#xD;
with a sigh, into his arm chair. " I was right, I per~&#xD;
ecieve," cried his wife, "it was a ghost."&#xD;
The banker could do no otherwise than confess all&#xD;
he had heard at the tavern. And, in less than a&#xD;
week, Mr. Dubois and the landlady, had both&#xD;
changed abodes; and their former houses were not&#xD;
only without tenants, but the terror of the neighbour-&#xD;
hood iii which they stood; and thus they continued&#xD;
for ten years; for it had so chanced, that military&#xD;
duty had called Montricul away from Paris, on the&#xD;
very day of his friend's funeral: ten years he was&#xD;
absent from Ihe city, and the story of the ghost was&#xD;
not elucidated till his return.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MOUNTAIN DOCTOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
A WEALTHY farmer, much affected with hypochon~&#xD;
dna, came, to Lan genau, to consult Michael Scup..&#xD;
pach, letter known by the appellation of the moun~&#xD;
tam doctor. " I have seven devils in my belly,"&#xD;
said he, "no fewer than seven." "There are more&#xD;
than seven," replied the doctor, with the utmost&#xD;
gravity; "if you count them right you will find&#xD;
eight." After questioning the patient concerning&#xD;
his case, he promised to cure him in eight days, dur-&#xD;
ing which time, he would every morning rid him of&#xD;
one of his troublesome inmates, at the rate of one&#xD;
louis d'or each. " But," added he, " as the last will&#xD;
be more obstinate and difficult to expel than the&#xD;
others, I shall expect two lois d'ors for him. The&#xD;
farmer agreed to these terms: the bargain was&#xD;
struck, and the doctor, impressing upon all present&#xD;
the necessity of secrecy, promised to give the nine&#xD;
louis d'ors to the poor of the parish Next morning,&#xD;
the imaginary demoniac was brought to him, an~d&#xD;
placed near a kind of machine, which he had never&#xD;
seen before, by which means he received an electric&#xD;
shock The farmer roared out lustily. "There&#xD;
goes one !" ~said the doctor, with the utmost gravity.&#xD;
Next day the same operation was repeat : e&#xD;
farmer bellowed as before, and the doctor coolly re~&#xD;
marked, "Another is off!" In this manner he pro-&#xD;
ceeded to the seventh. When he was preparing to&#xD;
attack the last, Sciippach reminded his patient that&#xD;
he. now had need of all his courage, for this was the&#xD;
captain of the gang, who would make a more obsti~&#xD;
nate resistance than any of the others. The shock&#xD;
was at this time so strong, as to extend the demoniac&#xD;
on the floor. "Now they are all gone!" said the&#xD;
doctor, and ordered the farmer to be l)ut to bed. On&#xD;
recovering himself, the latter declared he was com-&#xD;
pletely cured; he paid the nine, louis d'ors with&#xD;

AxN inhabitant of Montgaillard, lately deceased,&#xD;
left the following testament:-"It is my will that&#xD;

tears at my funeral shall be disinherited; he, on the&#xD;
other hand, who laughs most heartily, shall be sole&#xD;
heir. I order, that neither the church nor my house&#xD;

of my burial, the house and church shall'be decorat-.&#xD;

tolling of bells, I will have drums, fiddles, and fifes.&#xD;
All the musicians of Montgaillard and its environs&#xD;
shall attend the funeral. Fifty of them shall open&#xD;
the procession with hunting tunes, waltzes, and min-.&#xD;

A GERMAN LEGEND.&#xD;
IT was a lovely Itahian- evening, when a young&#xD;
German merchant, named Richard, entered Venice,&#xD;
the widely celebrated seat of traffic and commerce.&#xD;
In consequence of its being then the period of the the-&#xD;
ty years war, all Germany was, at that time, a scene&#xD;
of dissension; no wonder, therefore, if the young mer-&#xD;
chant, who was a gallant, more inclined to banquet-&#xD;
in. g and luxurious indulgence, than feats of chivalry,&#xD;
was not greatly displeased at his affairs calling him&#xD;
for some time towards Italy, where things wore a&#xD;
less hostile appearance, and where too, he had heard&#xD;
that there was no lack, either of the richest wines,&#xD;
or the most delicious fruits.&#xD;
In this fascinating city, Richard entered upon a&#xD;
career of dissipation, and continued daily to indulge&#xD;
in revels, and in the society of mirthful faces. In&#xD;
all the company of brave gallants, with whom he&#xD;
constantly associated, there was but one countenance&#xD;
overcast with gloom. It was that of a Spanish cap-&#xD;
tam, who, though he never failed to be present at&#xD;
these scenes of riot, rarely bestowed a word upon the&#xD;
company, while his dark features were rendered still&#xD;
more gloomy, by the visible uneasiness that sat upon&#xD;
them. Still his presence was endured, as he was a&#xD;
man of rank and wealth, and one too, who regarded&#xD;
lightly the expense of treating his friends evening&#xD;
after evening.&#xD;

* Richard, in the mean while, found his finances&#xD;
rapidly decreasing; and reflected with no small sor-&#xD;
row, that this gay and joyous kind of life must quick-&#xD;
ly terminate. His associates were not slow in o'b-&#xD;
serving his melancholy, or in divining the cause of&#xD;
it,-this being, by no means, the first instance of the&#xD;
kind, that had occurred within their society,-nei-&#xD;
ther did they spare their taunts upon the occasion,&#xD;
so 'that our gallant was fain to venture among them,&#xD;
the last precious relics of his purse. At this&#xD;
prosperous period of his history, the Spaniard&#xD;
called him, one evening, aside, and, with unexpect-&#xD;
ed courtesy, requesting that he would accompany&#xD;
him abroad, conducted him to a lone and retired&#xD;
spot. rrhe poor yotith was, at first, rather alarmed;&#xD;
but, at length, some what quieted his apprehensions&#xD;
by reflecting, that his companion well knew that he&#xD;
had little about him worth aught, save his skin, and&#xD;
in that he was determined a hole should not be&#xD;
pricked without returning the compliment.&#xD;
The Spaniard, however, having first seated hjm-&#xD;
self on the ruins of an old building, and compel led&#xD;
his companion to do the same, addressed him as fol&#xD;
lows:&#xD;
"I cannot help imagining, my dear young friend,&#xD;
that you stand greatly in need of that which has&#xD;
long become a burden to myself-namely, the pow-&#xD;
er of procuring whatever sum of money you choose,&#xD;
and whenever you please. This pQ~wer, such as it&#xD;
is, I am willing to dispose of to you for a trifling&#xD;
consideration, besides some other advantages into&#xD;
the bargain."&#xD;
"What occasion," inquired Richard, "can you&#xD;
possibly have for money, if you wish to part with&#xD;
the power of obtaining it yourself?"&#xD;
"The case stands thus," returned the captain.&#xD;
"I know not, whether you are acquainted with cer-&#xD;
tain little spirits, that are called 1~ottle-imps-they&#xD;
are small black devils, enclosed in a little phia I.&#xD;
Whoever possesses one of these, can command from&#xD;
86'&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BOTTLE-IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
it whatever worldly possession he desires most, es-&#xD;
peci ally abundance of gold. In return for these ser-&#xD;
vices, the soul of the person who possesses the imp&#xD;
becomes forfeit to Lucifer, in case he die without&#xD;
having previously disposed of him. ~But this can be&#xD;
done only by receiving a less sum than that which&#xD;
he first paid for the spirit. Mine cost me ten ducats;&#xD;
-for nine it is yours."&#xD;
While the youth was reflecting on this extraoKrdi-&#xD;
nary offer, the Spaniard contijiurd, "I could, if I&#xD;
pleased, easily get rid of the thing, by palimng it up-&#xD;
on some one as a mere curiosity, in which manner a&#xD;
knavish fellow inveigled me to purcha~ it. But I&#xD;
wish not to have the weight of such an ill deed upon&#xD;
my conscience, and 'therefore, very ho~icsLly, and&#xD;
fairly, acquaint you with the bargain. 'iT&amp;amp;u.m are still&#xD;
young and high-spirited, and will not fail to meet&#xD;
with opportunities enough of disposing of your put'-&#xD;
chase, whenever you may becon~e as weary of it, as&#xD;
I am even now."&#xD;
"My noble Sir," replied Richard, "an you would&#xD;
not take it ill at my hands, so could I inform you,&#xD;
how often I have been imposed upon already) irLthiS&#xD;
good city of Venice."&#xD;
"Why thou foolish varlet," exclaimed tbe enrao&#xD;
ed Spaniard, "thou neediest not call to mniad the&#xD;
brave entertainment I gave last evening, to judge&#xD;
whether I would cheat thee for the sake of a paltry&#xD;
nine ducats."&#xD;
"Who spends much, wants much," gently observ-&#xD;
ed the young merchant, "and the longest purse we&#xD;
kn~w has a bottom, although not a golden one. If,&#xD;
therefore, you yesterday spent your last ducat, to-&#xD;
day you may be hankering after mine."&#xD;
"Excuse me if I do not chastise thee with a cold&#xD;
steel for this insolence :-that I do not do it, is be-&#xD;
cause I still hope that you will rid me of my bottle-de-&#xD;
vil. Besides, it is my intention to perform penance,&#xD;
which would only be rendered still heavier there-&#xD;
by."&#xD;

"Might we no~at least, be favoured with some&#xD;
specimen of the things ability&#xD;
merchant.                 es?" inquired the wary&#xD;
"Hd\v may that be ?" answered the other. "It&#xD;
will neither remain with any one, nor aid any one,&#xD;
save him who has fairly purchased and paid for it."&#xD;
The youth could not help feeling some alarm, for&#xD;
the place where they were sitting, seemed a parti-&#xD;
cularly lone and gloomy spot,-although the Span&#xD;
iar(1 assured him, hat he would not employ compul-&#xD;
sive means. Yet, in spite of his fears, his irnagina-&#xD;
tion dwelt upon the enjoyments that would be in his&#xD;
power, should he become possessor of the little spirit;&#xD;
he determined, therefore, to try whether he could&#xD;
obtain the bargain at a cheaper rate.&#xD;
" Witless fellow that thou art," exelainied the&#xD;
Spaniard with a laugh, "It is for thy sake, and for&#xD;
the sake of those who shall come after thee, that I&#xD;
demand the highest sum I can; that I may delay, as&#xD;
long as possible, the time when it shall he purchased&#xD;
for the smallest coin possible, and the purchaser&#xD;
thereby become inevitably forfeit to the (levil, even&#xD;
because he cannot sell it again at a lower price."&#xD;
"Well," said Richard, with a tone of delight,&#xD;
"let me but have it. I warrant me I shall not be&#xD;
very eager to get quit of my purchase in a hurry. If,&#xD;
therefore, I could have it for fiye ducats&#xD;
'~ It is all one to me," returned the Spaniard,&#xD;
"but remember you' are hastening on the minute&#xD;
when the evil spirit shall claim, the last unhappy&#xD;
possessor as his own."&#xD;
With these words he delivered up to his co~~~an-&#xD;
ion, in retui~n for his gold, a small glass phial, where-&#xD;
in Richard could just discern, by the light of the&#xD;
stars, something dark that kept gaping up and&#xD;
down.&#xD;
By way of making an experiment he demanded,&#xD;
although but mentally, to have double the amount&#xD;
of the sum he had just expended, in his right hand,&#xD;
when he instantly felt ten ducats there. He now&#xD;
s8&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
returned in glee to the tavern, and ihe rest of the&#xD;
company, who were still carousing there, were not&#xD;
a little astonished at perceiving what cheerful coun&#xD;
tenances were now worn by those, wlfo were lately&#xD;
in so niciancholy a mood. But the Spaniard quick-&#xD;
ly retired without awaiting the costly banquet which,&#xD;
late as it was, Richard had ordered to be prepared,&#xD;
having first satisfied the demands of the wary host&#xD;
beforehand, for his pockets were now well lined with&#xD;
brave new ducats, which flocked thither merely at&#xD;
his wishing.&#xD;
Those who are most anxious for a similar bargain,&#xD;
will test imagine what kind of a life our wild gallant&#xD;
now lcd:-unless, indeed, they should be devoted to&#xD;
mere sordid avarice. Even the most charitable,&#xD;
may well suppose that he spent not his days or&#xD;
'nights in abstinence and fasting.&#xD;
The infatuated youth regarded even the poten-&#xD;
tates and princes of the world with a disdainfulcom-&#xD;
passion; convinced that not one of them was able to&#xD;
indulge in such a luxurious life as himself. Even&#xD;
Venice, the most opulent mart in the world; coub&amp;amp;l&#xD;
hardly find dainties enough for his extravagant ban-&#xD;
quets. Did a well meaning friend hint at the im-&#xD;
prudence of this continual rioting, he would indig-&#xD;
nantly reply: "Richard is my name, and my rich-&#xD;
es are boundless." Often would he, in a fit of in-&#xD;
temperate mirth, rudely jest ~t the folly of the Span-&#xD;
iard, who had cast such a prize from him, and, as he&#xD;
had heard it reported, had retired into a convent.&#xD;
On this earth, however, there is nothing that lasts&#xD;
for ever. This too our gallant soon experienced to&#xD;
be truth, much sooner, indeed, than he would other-&#xD;
wise have done, in conse q~uence of the intemperance&#xD;
with which he plunged into all pleasures. A lan~&#xD;
gour like that of death seized his exhausted frame, in&#xD;
spite of all the virtue of the phial, which he vainly&#xD;
kept invoking for health, at the first attack of his&#xD;
disease. Recovery visited him not, but on the con-&#xD;
trary frightful dreams.&#xD;

&#xD;
It seemed. to him that one of' the phiats which&#xD;
were standing by his bed-side, began to set up a&#xD;
wild dance, jostling against the rest in a furious&#xD;
manner. "After gazing at it for some minutes, Rich-&#xD;
ardjrecognised -it to be that in which the little spirit&#xD;
was enclosed, and exclaimed: " Bottle-devil, bottle-&#xD;
devil, thou assistest me no more, but rather destroy-&#xD;
est that which should work my cure." Whereupon&#xD;
the little black thing sang in a hoarse voice:&#xD;
" Richard ! Richard ! praiyest in vain:&#xD;
Prepare thee now for eternal pain;&#xD;
Therein must thou abide and endure,.&#xD;
Since spirit's power can work no cure-.-&#xD;
No herb that groweth, death can heal:-&#xD;
I joy, for that thou'rt mime I feel.&#xD;
After vtih it immediately stretched itself out, quite&#xD;
long and thin, and, notwithstanding that Richard&#xD;
held the phial stopped as closely as possible, it crept&#xD;
out between his thumb and the cork: it then sud-&#xD;
denly became a large black man, who began to&#xD;
dance in a most hideous manner, clapping to and&#xD;
fro, at the same time, his huge dusky wings.; and at&#xD;
length placed his hairy, leathern breast, upon Rich;.&#xD;
ard's bosom, and his grinning face upon Richard's&#xD;
face, so that the latter felt as if he were himself as-&#xD;
suming the hideous figure, and in a tone of wild ago-&#xD;
ny, screamed out for a mirror.&#xD;
A cold sweat .stood upon his brow, as he awoke&#xD;
out of the ghastly dreani, and he thought that he&#xD;
perceived a monstrous black toad creep down be-&#xD;
side him into his bed; but, upon putting down his&#xD;
hand, he felt only the phial, in which the little black&#xD;
figure lay panting and apparently exhausted.&#xD;
How awfully long did the remainder of this hor-&#xD;
rible night seem to the si'k and phrensied wretch.&#xD;
He dared not again to resign himself to sleep, lest&#xD;
the terrific vision should re-appear; hardly too, did&#xD;
he venture to open his wearied eyes, even in the&#xD;
dark, lest he should perceive the monstrous fiend&#xD;
squiatted in some corner of the apartment. Yet&#xD;

did he shut his eyes but for a moment, he thought&#xD;
that it was again upon him, and started up with hor-&#xD;
ror. He rang aloudl for shis attendants, but no one&#xD;
camne, all was still as the grave. Thus did he lie, in&#xD;
a state-of' torturing horror, throughout the whole of&#xD;
that long, dreary night, the terror of which was in-&#xD;
creased ,when he reflected th-at, if this single night ap-&#xD;
peared almost an eternity of terrors, what must&#xD;
seem the eternal night of hell, on which no day&#xD;
would ever dawn-t hat night to whose -dreadful&#xD;
visions there would be no end ?-H-e determined, at&#xD;

very next morning.&#xD;
When, however, the morning came, he felt his&#xD;
spirits so much revived, that he began to ask himself&#xD;
whether he had vet turned the bottle-imp sufficient-&#xD;
ly to account. Palaces and villas, and all the luxui-&#xD;
ries wherewith they were furnished, seemed hardly&#xD;
enough; he, therefore, instantly demanded a great&#xD;
heap of ducats to be placed beneath his pillow, andl&#xD;
on finding them there instantaneously, he then be-&#xD;
gan to reflect how best to dispose of the talisman.&#xD;
He knew that his physician was a great naturalist,&#xD;
and one who sought much after all monsters, and all&#xD;
such wonderful productions as are generally kept in&#xD;
spirits; lie hoped, ,therefore, that he should be able&#xD;
to pass off the bottle-imp to the learned man as a cu-&#xD;
riosity of this description; for else the doctor was&#xD;
too good-a Christian to have any thing to do with the&#xD;
evil creature. The deceit, indeed could hardly be&#xD;
termed an innocent one, but need knows no nice-&#xD;
ties.&#xD;
Accordingly, he offered the doctor the little spirit,&#xD;
.which was rnow become again exceedingly lively,&#xD;
jumping to and fro, in the bottle, with great vivaci-&#xD;
ty; -insomuch that, anxious to examine what he con-&#xD;
sidered a wonderful lusuis natural, the learned man&#xD;
agreed to purchase it, if the price demanded foir it&#xD;
were not too high. In order to satisfy his conscience&#xD;
as well as he could, Richard asked a sum as nearly&#xD;

approaching to five ducats as was possible: the do~-&#xD;
tor, however, would give no more thanthree, which,&#xD;
fearing to lose his customer altogether, the other at&#xD;
last accepted, taking care, however, to bestow it all&#xD;
in alms upon the poor. But the money which he&#xD;
had found under his pillow, he carefully laid by, as&#xD;
the only fund upon which his future wealth an~&#xD;
prosperity depended.&#xD;
In the mean while, his disorder continued to in-&#xD;
crease; he lay in a constant delirium, and had he&#xD;
still been tormented by the possession of the bottle..&#xD;
(levilthere is no doubt but that he would actually have&#xD;
(lied of terror and anxiety. At length, however, he&#xD;
gradually grew better; and no~V the only thing that&#xD;
seemed to retard his recovery, was his solicitude&#xD;
about the du~ ats, which he could no longer find be-&#xD;
neath his pi&amp;amp;w. At first he was very loth to make&#xD;
any inquiry after them; when, however, he did so&#xD;
no one could give any account of them. Being able&#xD;
to obtain no information respecting the gold, it&#xD;
now remained for him to consider how he might&#xD;
best convert his mansion and villas into money. But&#xD;
here too, he was reckon4g without his host, for a&#xD;
throng of creditors appeared with various claims up-&#xD;
on his estates, all duly signed by himself, and sealed~&#xD;
with his own sfgnet: all that he could do, therefore,&#xD;
was to depart as quickly as possible, with the little&#xD;
he could save from the fangs of these harpies; so that&#xD;
he quitted all his splen"dour very nearly a beggar.&#xD;
At this juncture, his physician made his appear-&#xD;
ance, with a countenance betokening serious dis-&#xD;
pleasure. "Doctor," exclaimed the unfortunate&#xD;
young merchant, "if it be, that you are come hither,&#xD;
like the rest of your fraternity, with a large bill, I&#xD;
prithee add another item to the account, and see,&#xD;
good doctor, that it be for opium, or some equally po-&#xD;
tent drug: for my last bread is now baked,, as I&#xD;
know but too well, I having no money to buy more."&#xD;
"Nay, nay," replied the physician, "things are&#xD;
not yet so bad as that. I am not only ready to r~&#xD;
92&#xD;
&#xD;
K&#xD;
&#xD;
pounce every demand upon you, but have also pre.&#xD;
pared a certain, most efficacious medicine, that will&#xD;
quickly revive you from this despondency; all that I&#xD;
ask for it is two ducats."&#xD;
"And most readily will I pay them," replied the&#xD;
youth, which, having done, the doctor forthwith de~&#xD;
parted. On opening the box, wherein he expected&#xD;
to find his cordial restorative, he discovered a phial;&#xD;
but how great was his dismay on perceiving that it&#xD;
was that which contained the little bottle-devil; ~nd&#xD;
that, affixed to it, it had a label containing the~ fol..&#xD;
lowing lines:&#xD;
Thy body I strove to cure from ill,&#xD;
But thou my soul hast sought to kill;&#xD;
Yet, ha3 my att, 'hove craft of thine,&#xD;
Perceiv'd full soon thy base design.&#xD;
Let me now retaliate,&#xD;
To thee again revert thy flute&#xD;
Be thine once more the dreadful sprite,&#xD;
And mayst thou feel his fetlest might.&#xD;
Great, indeed, was Richard's alarm, at finding that&#xD;
he had re-purchased his phial, at so much lower a&#xD;
price.&#xD;
Having, first of all, summoned by~a wish, a sum&#xD;
of money double to that which he had lost, he carri-&#xD;
ed and deposited it all with the nearest scriArener,&#xD;
excepting one hundred and twenty pieces. He then&#xD;
paid a visit to an antiquated lady, and, alter some&#xD;
time, displayed the curious toy he had brought, mak.&#xD;
ing the little black puppet, enclosed in the phial,&#xD;
perform abundant antics atud tricks. She, like the&#xD;
rest of her sex, was (1esirou~ of obtaining such a droll&#xD;
play-thing; and, on the youth's demanding a ducat&#xD;
for it, she l)ai(l it without hesitation. This bargain&#xD;
being completed, Richard hastened away as quickly&#xD;
as he could, and repaired to the scrivener, with&#xD;
Whorri he had deposited his money. He now found,&#xD;
however, that gold sticks so fast to certain l)eople's&#xD;
fingers, that they cannot shake it off. The honest&#xD;

man stared with the utmost astonishment, protesting&#xD;
most vehemently, that he had never clapped his eyes&#xD;
on the young fellow before. This worthy specimen&#xD;
of probity, had written his receipt for the sum de-&#xD;
posited, with a kind of ink that totally disappeared&#xD;
in the space of a few hours: therefore, when Rich-&#xD;
ard produceflhis voucher, he found that he had&#xD;
merely a piece of plain paper. He thus found him-&#xD;
self suddenly reduced to poverty, and would, indeed,&#xD;
have been completely a beggar, had he not still thir-&#xD;
ty ducats remaining.&#xD;
He who lies in too short a bed, must even pull up his&#xD;
legs; he who has no bed, must couch on the bare floor;&#xD;
who cannot afford to ride, must walk:-so was it with&#xD;
our rrterchant, who was now fain to become a ped-&#xD;
icr.&#xD;
For this purpose he provided himself with a suit-&#xD;
able box: but with what a heavy heart did he first&#xD;
buckle it on, to take his stand, with some small ware&#xD;
in those very streets where, hut a few weeks before,&#xD;
he used *to pass with a splendid retinue. In a little&#xD;
while, however, he became somewhat reconciled to&#xD;
his new occupation, having no lack of customers.&#xD;
"If I proceed at this rate," thought he, "1 may yet&#xD;
again become a prosperous man, and that too, at no&#xD;
very distant time. I will then return to my native&#xD;
Germany, where I shall find myself more comfort-&#xD;
able than ever, after being in the power of the ac-&#xD;
cursed bottle-devil, and having got out of his clutch-&#xD;
es by my own skill and dexterity.&#xD;
With such thoughts did our newly made pedler&#xD;
cheer and console himself, on retiring for the night,&#xD;
to an obscure inn. On taking off his box, severalof&#xD;
the guests, attracted by curiosity, began to examine&#xD;
the various wares it contained.&#xD;
"My good friend," exclaimed one of these inquisi-&#xD;
tive gentry, "prythee, what queer kind of animal is&#xD;
this which you have got here in this phial, i~nd&#xD;
which keeps jumping about at so strange ~ rate?"__&#xD;

time, perceived that, along with the other articles&#xD;
in his box, he had purchased the fatal bottle-devil.&#xD;
Instantly did he offer it to the bystan ~l for a mere&#xD;
trifling sum, but not one of them coud endure the&#xD;
hideous creature, neither could Richard inform&#xD;
them of any particular use it was of; he, nevei~the-&#xD;
less, continued to harrass them at such a rate, with&#xD;
his entreaties to purchase it, that, at length, they&#xD;
thrust the impertinent chapman and his wares into&#xD;
the street.&#xD;
In the anguish of his distress he now returned to&#xD;
the person who had sold him the box, and pressed&#xD;
him to take back the little i.mp at a lower price.&#xD;
The fellow, however, quite out of temper, at being&#xD;
disturbed at such an unreasonable hour, and little&#xD;
~: disposed to become a dealer in such strange coin-&#xD;
modities, bade him begone.&#xD;
Thus repulsed, he retired, and drawing the little&#xD;
dusky imp from his pocket, he cried; "Thou mis-&#xD;
creant devil! If I again call on thee for thy services,&#xD;
it is, that I may rid myself of thee for ever."&#xD;
Having thus vented the bitterness of his feelings,&#xD;
he forthwith desired to have a sum much more con-&#xD;
siderable than the last, and then, almost sinking un-&#xD;
der its weight, he proceeded to the next town. Here&#xD;
he purchased a splendid equipage, hired a numerous&#xD;
retinue, and set out for Rome, convinced that there&#xD;
he should soon be able to find some one, who would&#xD;
not scruple to take his unwelcome little coi~ipanion&#xD;
off his hands. As often as he expended a ducat, did&#xD;
he require the 'imp to replace it by another, in order&#xD;
..hat, after selling his phial, he might still have the&#xD;
entire sum. Tf his seemed to him no more than a&#xD;
fair compensation for the horrors he constantly 'en-&#xD;
dured; for, in addition to the nightly visits of the&#xD;
black apparition, that never failed to come, and lie&#xD;
Upon his breast, he saw also, the bottle-devil con-&#xD;
stantly frisking about the phial, with the most hor-&#xD;
rible glee, as if now quite certain of his prey, at the&#xD;
expiration of the due term of his service.&#xD;

&#xD;
Hardly had his wealth and the figt~re which he&#xD;
made, procured him admission into the first circles&#xD;
of Roman society, than his constant dread would not&#xD;
allow him to wait until a proper opportunity should&#xD;
offer, of freeing himself from his tormentor. He&#xD;
was continually offering his phial to every person,&#xD;
demanding for it three groschen in German money;&#xD;
insomuch that he, in a short time, became to be con-&#xD;
sidered as a lunatic, and was a subject of ridicule to&#xD;
every one. Money makes a good mood, and r~any&#xD;
a fair friend withal: so was it with our Richard; yet&#xD;
no sooner did he produce his phial, and begin to talk&#xD;
of' three groschens, than all present were glad to es-&#xD;
cape his importunity.&#xD;
So great at lengths was his despair, that he could&#xD;
no longer endure to remain at Rome, but determin-&#xD;
ed to try. his fate in war, hoping that, by some&#xD;
chance, he might there, at least, get rid of the cause&#xD;
of his misery. He had heard that two small Italian&#xD;
states were engaged in hostilities towards each other,&#xD;
and prepared to espouse the cause of one party.&#xD;
Adorned with a rich golden cuirass, and a superb&#xD;
crest of plumes, and armed with two light hunting&#xD;
pieces, an admirably tempered sword, and two beau-&#xD;
tiful daggers, did he set out, mounted on a noble&#xD;
Spanish steed, and attended by three followers, all&#xD;
of whom were bravely equipped.&#xD;
A volunteer of so gallant a bearing, needed not to&#xD;
offer his services in vain. Richard soon saw himself,&#xD;
therefore, attached to a troop of brave comrades, and&#xD;
led such a .jovial life in camp, with drinking and sing.&#xD;
ing, that his mortal apprehensions, and nocturnal vis'&#xD;
ions, gradually left hun. Having received a good&#xD;
lesson from what he experienced at Rome, he was&#xD;
now cautious in offering his strange ware for sale;&#xD;
observing not to urge it with stich suspicious earnest-&#xD;
ness. Indeed, he had hardly spoken of it to any one,&#xD;
hoping thereby to have an opportunity of meeti&#xD;
with some one who would not refuse it, if offered&#xD;
~4uite unawares; and with seeming indifference.&#xD;
96&#xD;
&#xD;
- ~&#xD;
&#xD;
One morning, as Richard was playing at dice,&#xD;
with some companions, they were suddenly sum&#xD;
moned to battle, by an alarm sounded on the trum..&#xD;
pet. The 'cry was instantly "to horse !" With&#xD;
joyous spirits did our warrior leap upon his steed, as&#xD;
it neighed and pawed the ground; the leaders en-&#xD;
couraged on their troops, the signal sounded for the&#xD;
combat. A, troop of the enemy's cavalry advanced,&#xD;
apparently for the purpose of hindering their attack;&#xD;
yet they soon retired before the powerful charge of&#xD;
their adversaries, nor were Richard and his follow-&#xD;
ers the last among the pursuers. The balls now be-&#xD;
gan to whiz in the air, and many a rider fell from&#xD;
his horse, rolling to the earth in his blood. Spite of&#xD;
his personal couarge, Richard could not think with-&#xD;
out shuddering, of the immediate peril in which ht~&#xD;
was placed, fearing that some fatal ball might, in a&#xD;
single moment, deliver him into the power, not only&#xD;
of the bottle-devil, but of the great Satan himself.-.&#xD;
Scarcely, however, had he expressed a wish to es-&#xD;
cape from the scene of danger, ere his steed bore&#xD;
him away to a wood, which was situated at no great&#xD;
distance.&#xD;
So hard did he spur the animal, and urge him to&#xD;
flight, that it at length stopped quite exhausted.&#xD;
He then alighted, being himself greatly fatigued' un-&#xD;
buckled his own cuirass, and sword, and the trap'&#xD;
pings of his horse, and laying himself down on the&#xD;
grass, said: "This fighting is dangerous work at the&#xD;
best, but much more so with a devil in one's pock-&#xD;
et !" He now wished to devise what course it would&#xD;
behove him neixt to pursue, but fell into a profouiid&#xD;
sleep."&#xD;
After he had indulged in a repose of several hours,&#xD;
tie was awakened by the sound of voices and ap-&#xD;
proaching footsteps. He stirred not in hope that he&#xD;
might be passed by unnoticed, but soon found that&#xD;
the attempt would not succeed, for a voice; of no&#xD;
very friendly or musical tone, thundered out; "Ho!&#xD;

honour of killing you?" Looking up perforce at&#xD;
this uncourteous address, the unfortunate Richard&#xD;
F perceived a musket levelled at his breast. The feb&#xD;
ow who held it, was arufflanly-looking foot soldier,&#xD;
and the others had already seized upon his steed and&#xD;
equipment as their booty. *Struck with terror, he&#xD;
supplicated most earnestly for mercy, but if they&#xD;
were determined upon shooting him, requested that&#xD;
one of them would first purchase a little phial, which&#xD;
he had in his pocket.&#xD;
- "Setiseless poltroon that thou art !" cried one of&#xD;
the fellows with a grin, "to suppose that we here&#xD;
barter for any thing; although that we will take the&#xD;
bargain off thy hands, thou neediest not fear;" and&#xD;
so saying, he seized hold of the phial, and thrust it&#xD;
into his bosom.&#xD;
"In God's name thou art welcome to it," cried&#xD;
Richard, "if thou canst keep it. Yet that thou&#xD;
can~4 not do, unless thou first purchase it."&#xD;
The soldier laughed at hearing him speak thus,&#xD;
and, thinking him somewhat crack brained, rode off&#xD;
without paying farther attention to him. On feel-&#xD;
ing in his pocket, however, Richard found that the&#xD;
phial was there again, whereupon, holding it up&#xD;
that they might see it, he called after them. The&#xD;
fellow who had taken it was struck with amazement;&#xD;
and as, on thrusting his hand into his bosom, he did&#xD;
not feel it, he ran back in order to recover his&#xD;
booty.&#xD;
"Did I not tell thee," said Richard mournfully,&#xD;
"that it would not continue with thee. Pay me but&#xD;
the trifle I demand and it is thy own."&#xD;
"Juggler !" returned the soldier, "dost thou think&#xD;
to defraud me of my well-earned spoils, by these con..&#xD;
during tricks of thine?~'&#xD;
And holding the phial carefully in his hand, away&#xD;
he ran to overtake his companions: suddenly, how-&#xD;
ever, he stopped short, exclaiming, with an oath,&#xD;
that it was gone again. Whist he was searching for&#xD;
it on the ground, Richard called out to him once&#xD;
98&#xD;
&#xD;
THE" BOT TLE-IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
5nore: "Return hither, my good friend, for it is&#xD;
again in my pocket."&#xD;
On finding this really to be the case, the soldier&#xD;
became more desirous of possessing so curious and&#xD;
wonderful a thing. On these occasions, indeed, it&#xD;
always manifested more than usual liveliness and&#xD;
agility, knowing that such bargains accelerated the&#xD;
iThal term of its servitude. Three groschen, how-&#xD;
ever, still seemed too much to the soldier. "WelI&#xD;
then, since thou art so unwilling to part with thy&#xD;
coin, let it be a single groschen, and take away the&#xD;
purchase in good hour." Thereupon was the bar-&#xD;
gain concluded, the money paid, and the little bottle&#xD;
devil delivered up to his new master. While the&#xD;
soldier and his companions were examining the&#xD;
singular creature, and amusing themselves with its&#xD;
grim antics, Richard was reflecting upon his future&#xD;
destiny. His heart now felt quite light; but unfor..&#xD;
tunately, his purse was quite as light as his heart;&#xD;
nor did he know to what to betake himself, since he&#xD;
Would not venture to return to his troop, although&#xD;
he left there, not only his followers and his equip-&#xD;
ments, but all his money. He was partly ashamed&#xD;
of his disgraceful flight, and partly afraid lest if he&#xD;
returned, he should be put to death as a deserter.&#xD;
It then occurred to him, that it would not be amiss&#xD;
were he to offer to accompany these troopers, hav-&#xD;
ing gathered from their discourse that they belong-&#xD;
ed to the other party, among whom he was certain&#xD;
of remaining unknown; and now that he had lost&#xD;
all h~s cash, and gotten rid of his little (le vii to boot,&#xD;
hc had gotten back some of his courage in exchange,&#xD;
and was, by no means, disinclined to venture his&#xD;
life once again, in the hope of obtaining some valu-&#xD;
able spoil. He accordingly gave utterance to his&#xD;
wishes; and his proposal being accepted, he forth&#xD;
with set off with his new comrades.&#xD;
'rim captain was not very scrupulous in taking&#xD;
into his serviCe such a tall and well built young fel-&#xD;
low as Richard, who was therefore considered as&#xD;

&#xD;
rainy enlisted among them. He was still, however,&#xD;
displeased with his lot; for, since the last battle, the&#xD;
two armies remained quite inactive, without either&#xD;
attacking the other, a treaty of peace being in agita-&#xD;
tion. Under these circumstances, there was little&#xD;
danger of wounds, but, at the same time, very little&#xD;
opportunity of fattening on booty and plunder.-&#xD;
Instead of the latter,, the troops must perforce)&#xD;
content themselves with their camp fare, and their&#xD;
scanty pay. In addition to this, while most of his&#xD;
comrades had already enriched themselves in the&#xD;
preceding engagements, Richard, the once wealthy&#xD;
merchant, was almost the only one who was a&#xD;
beggar among opulent neighbors. Very natural-&#xD;
ly, therefore, he grew weary of such a life, so that&#xD;
once having received his monthly pay-too in-&#xD;
considerable for his wants, and yet too much for him&#xD;
not to attempt something with it-he determined to&#xD;
go to a settling booth, and see whether the dice&#xD;
would not befriend him more than either traffic or&#xD;
war had hitherto done.&#xD;
His success at play was as checkered as usual, now&#xD;
winning, now losing; and so did it continue, un-&#xD;
til late at night, when all the dice turned up against&#xD;
Richard whose cash was now quite gone, nor would&#xD;
any one give him credit for a doit. He now offered&#xD;
to stake his cartridges, having nothing else to offer;&#xD;
the proposal was accepted; and, as the throw was&#xD;
about to be made, Richard perceived that the soldier&#xD;
who had accepted the stake, was the very same who'&#xD;
had purchased the bottle-devil, by the assistance of&#xD;
which he would, doubtless, be certain of winning.&#xD;
He would fain have cried "hold !" but the dice&#xD;
had already decided in favour of his opponent.&#xD;
tTttering curses at his ill fate, he quitted the coml)a-&#xD;
ny, and retired in the dark to his own tent. A com-&#xD;
rade who had been equally unfortunate at play, but&#xD;
whose brain was less heated by wine, now took him&#xD;
by the arm, and, as they were proceeding together&#xD;
100&#xD;
&#xD;
THlE BOTTLE-IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
inquired whether he had any more cartridges in his&#xD;
tent.&#xD;
"No," returned Richard, furiously; "did I pos-&#xD;
sess any, they too should serve me for the same pur-&#xD;
pose."&#xD;
"Then," said his companion, "you would do well&#xD;
to provide yourself with fresh ones, for should the&#xD;
commissary come to examine you, and find you with-&#xD;
out them, he will order you to be shot."&#xD;
"Zounds! that were plague work indeed !-but I&#xD;
have neither cartridges, nor wherewithal to procure&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"'Phine is a sorry case indeed, then," replied the&#xD;
other, "for the' commissary comes hither on the&#xD;
morrow."&#xD;
This intelligence, though it did not tend greatly&#xD;
to tranquilize Richard, served in some degree to so-&#xD;
ber him; he went therefore, to inquire of his com-&#xD;
rades, if any one would lend him some cartnidgesb&#xD;
All, however, flouted him a.s a wild; idle fellow, and&#xD;
ha(!e him not interrupt them with unseasonable stufL&#xD;
In the utmost apprehension, lest he should be order-&#xD;
ed to he shot the very n~ext (lay, he rummaged every&#xD;
where, in the hope of finding some loose coin, but&#xD;
coul(1 meet witl~ no more than five hellers. Late as&#xD;
it now was, he hurried from tent to tent, in order to&#xD;
find some one who would supply him with the cart-&#xD;
ridges. Some laughed at, others abused him, but&#xD;
not one made any reply to his demand. At length,&#xD;
he came to a tent, the occupant of which he discov-&#xD;
ered to be the very soldier who had so lately stripped&#xD;
him of his cartridges at play.&#xD;
Comrade," cried Richard, with great agitation,&#xD;
"if any one, it is yourself who must assist me in this&#xD;
extremity. But just now you plundered me of all&#xD;
my cart ridges, nor is it the first time in my lice ,that&#xD;
you have proved the cause of my misfortunes. On&#xD;

'lets for me to be shot; you must therefore either&#xD;
give or lend,-at least sell me some."&#xD;
"As to either giving or lending, that I have long&#xD;
ago forsworn; yet, to ease your distress, I will agree&#xD;
to sell you some. What money therefore have&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"But five heller~," replied Richard, in a mcIan.~&#xD;
choly tone.&#xD;
" Well," said the soldier, "to show thee that I am&#xD;
willing to do thee a comrade's turn, there are five&#xD;
cartridges for thy five Itellers. Now then, betake&#xD;
thyself to thy rest, and disturb neither me nor my&#xD;
neighbours any longer;" which request, as soon, as&#xD;
he had received what he sought, Richard instantly&#xD;
hastened to comply with.&#xD;
On the following day, the troops were examined,&#xD;
and Richard passed muster with his five cartridges,&#xD;
at which he, for a while, considered himself su-&#xD;
p remedy happy, in spite of all the misfortunes he&#xD;
had undergone. His felicity was, however, but of&#xD;
very short duration: the joy he at first felt, at find-&#xD;
ing himself out of actual danger, soon subsided,&#xD;
when, on retiring to his tent, he found himself oblig-&#xD;
ed to dine on coarse bread, without any better sauce&#xD;
to it than his own reflections9 "What would I not&#xD;
now give," sighed he, "had I but one of all the du.&#xD;
cats which, in the days of my folly, I so wantonly&#xD;
squandered away." Hardly had he formed the&#xD;
wish, when, lo! a beautiful bright golden dacat was&#xD;
in his hand. But, alas! the thought of the bottle-&#xD;
devil, which instantly flashed across his mind, damp-&#xD;
ed all the satisfaction he had otherwise felt, at find-&#xD;
ing himself possessor of so acceptable a piece of&#xD;
gold.&#xD;
At this instant, the comrade of whom he had ur-&#xD;
chased the cartridges entered his tent, with a loot~ of&#xD;
anxiety, and said, " Friend, I have missed the phi~l&#xD;
with the little black creature, you must remember it&#xD;
' well; it is the same that I formerly purchased of&#xD;
yourself. Has it happened that I sold it to you by&#xD;
10~&#xD;
&#xD;
THE B3OTTLE-IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
tnistake for a cartridge, for I wrapped it up in a&#xD;
piece of palmer, and it was lying close beside them?"&#xD;
With a trembling hand did Richard now search in&#xD;
his cartridge-box, and found, the first thing he took&#xD;
hold of, to be the fatal phial, wrapped up in the form&#xD;
of a cartridge.&#xD;
"Ha!" cried the soldier, " this is all right. 'r~&#xD;
say the truib, ugly as the creature is, I should be ex-&#xD;
ceedingly loth to lose it, since I somehow cannot&#xD;
help fancying that it helps me to good luck. So,&#xD;
comra(le, take one of the Ite11er~ back again, and re-&#xD;
(urn to me my bottle."&#xD;
Most readily did Richard accede to this demand,&#xD;
and the soldier departed equally l)leased.&#xD;
Yet was poor Richard ill at '~ase, after having met&#xD;
with his hot tle-devi once more, and having had it&#xD;
again in his own possession, he could not help ima-&#xD;
wining that lie saw it grinning at him, between the&#xD;
toWs of his tent, and that it would strangle him in&#xD;
his sleep. Much as he stood in need of refreshment,&#xD;
he flung the piece of money from him; and at length,&#xD;
his terror, lest the accursed being should once more&#xD;
return while he continued there, arose to such a&#xD;
pitch, that he fled from the camp, and entered a&#xD;
thick wood, where, exhausted by alarm and fatigue,&#xD;
he sunk down in a wild lonesome spot.&#xD;
"Ah me!" he exclaimed, as he lay there panting,&#xD;
"that I had but a camp bottle, with water, to keep&#xD;
me from dying with faintness!" And the bottle of&#xD;
water stood besi(le him. It was not till after he had&#xD;
diank a hearty draught of it, that he thoug~it of ask.&#xD;
ing himself by what means it came there. The bot-&#xD;
tle-devil now occurred to him; when, putting his&#xD;
hands into his pockets, and finding the phial there,&#xD;
overcome with sudden horror, he fell do~vn in a deep&#xD;
SWOOn.&#xD;
While he continued in this state, his former horri-&#xD;
ble dream returned, wherein he beheld the little&#xD;
bottle-imp stretch himself out longer and longer, and&#xD;
at last fix himself, grinning most hideously, upon his&#xD;
103&#xD;

MARVELLOUS RE1'OSJTO~Y.&#xD;
breast; he expostulated with the monster, assert.&#xD;
ing that it no longer belonged to him, but the&#xD;
creature replied, with a hollow satanic laugh:&#xD;
"Thou bought me for a heller-must, therefore,&#xD;
either sell me for less, or the bargain will not hold&#xD;
good."&#xD;
Richard leaped up in horror, and thought he still&#xD;
beheld the terrific figure, as it re-entered the phial,&#xD;
in his pocket. In a state of agonized phrenzy, he&#xD;
dashed the phial from him, down a steep hollow,&#xD;
hut instantly afterwards, felt it again in his pocket.&#xD;
"Alas! alas !" screamed the unhappy wretch, "how&#xD;
fortunate did I at one time consider myself, at find-&#xD;
ing that, let me cast away the bottle ever so far, it&#xD;
always returned to ms--but that it does so, is now&#xD;
my misery-yes, my everlasting misery." And he,&#xD;
thereupon, began to run furiously among the wild&#xD;
bushwood, dashing in the dark against trunks of&#xD;
trees, and pieces of rock, and hearing, at every step&#xD;
he took, the phial clirfking in his pocket.&#xD;
At day break, he arrived at an open plain, which&#xD;
had the appearance of being well cultivated, and&#xD;
had a cheerful aspect; somewhat revived by this&#xD;
prOSl)eCt, he began to hope that what he had e~pe-&#xD;
rwnced was merely a wild dream, and that the&#xD;
phial would prove to be no more than a common bot-&#xD;
tle. He took it out, therefore, and held it up against&#xD;
the sun; but, alas! he still perceived the little black&#xD;
monster, dancing up and down; and stretching out&#xD;
towards him as usual, its little, ugly, misshapen arms,&#xD;
as if it would seize hold of him. Uttering a loud&#xD;
cry of agony, he let the phial fall on the ground, but&#xD;
only to feel it in his pocket immediately afterwards.&#xD;
The thing of the utmost consequence for hini now to&#xD;
do, was to inquire every where for some coin of less&#xD;
value than a keller. No where, however, could he&#xD;
meet wjth any such piece of money; so that, at&#xD;
length, despairing of being ever able to get rid of&#xD;
the monster that now threatened, inevitably, to be-&#xD;
come his master, he no longer thought of calling up&#xD;
104&#xD;
&#xD;
THE I3OTTLE-.IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
on it for its services; his increasing b~vror, on the&#xD;
~ontrary, would permit him to think of nothing but&#xD;
his miserable situation. Thus did he wander up&#xD;
and down, subsisting upon charity; and as he had a&#xD;
wild, crazed appearance, and was continually be-&#xD;
seeching every one for some piece of money less than&#xD;
a helter, he was considered as a mad-man, and was&#xD;
~alIed, "Crazy Ha~f-heller," by which appellation&#xD;
he was soon known far and wide.&#xD;
It is said that the vulture sometimes fixes itself&#xD;
with its talons into the back of a young deer, and&#xD;
thus hunts to death the poor animal, which, as it&#xD;
flees, in agony, still carries along with it, its savage,&#xD;
relentless enemy. Thus was it with poor Richard,&#xD;
and the satanic imp in his 1)hial. But, instead of&#xD;
accompanying hint through his continual and un-&#xD;
varied misery, let us pass over a considerable inter-&#xD;
val, and arrive at an important event.&#xD;
He had one day lost himself i~ a wild rocky coun-&#xD;
try, and had set down to rest beside a little stream,&#xD;
whose murmuring seemed to sympatize with his&#xD;
affliction. A loud sound of horse's feet rung on the&#xD;
rocky surface of the ground, when there came riding&#xD;
upon a large, black, wild-looking steed, a man of&#xD;
gigantic figure, and exceedingly terrific counte~.&#xD;
nance; he was attired in a deep blood-red garment,&#xD;
and approached the spot where Richard was sit-&#xD;
ting.&#xD;
"Wherefore so melancholy, young stranger?"&#xD;
~aid he, addressing himself to the youth, who invo-&#xD;
luntarily shuddered at his voice, as if with a vague&#xD;
presentiment of something evil:-" I should take&#xD;
thee to be a merchant;-hast thou been making a&#xD;
bad bargain?--hast purchased any thing at too high&#xD;
a price ?"&#xD;
"Alas, no! rather at too low a one," returned&#xD;
Richard, in a tremulous tone.&#xD;
"Aye, so I should think indeed," rejoined the&#xD;
grim horseman, with a horrible laugh. "And hast&#xD;
thou then got for sale a thing that they call a bottle-&#xD;
'o~i&#xD;
&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7980-00000054"/>&#xD;
MARVELLOUS REPOSITORY.&#xD;
imp? Or am! mistaken in conjecturing you to oe a&#xD;
.razy HaIf-heller?"&#xD;
The poor youth was hardly able to reply, "yes,"&#xD;
so great was his horror, expecting every instant, to&#xD;
behold the apparition's mantle expand itself into a&#xD;
pair of bloody-Wings, and his steed to assume a more&#xD;
terrific spectral appearance~ breathing forth in fer~&#xD;
nal flames from his nostrils; and, lastly, that the&#xD;
monster would carry off his wretched soul to the re-&#xD;
gions qf eternal misery.&#xD;
But the ghastly horseman said, in somewhat&#xD;
milder voice, and with less appalling mien: "I per-&#xD;
ceive for whom you take me; yet be comforted, for&#xD;
1 am not he, I rather present myself to rescue you,&#xD;
if so may be, from his power; having for some days&#xD;
past been searching for you, in order to become the&#xD;
purchaser of your phial. To confess the truth, my&#xD;
friend, thou hast paid indeed a most damnable small&#xD;
sum for it, nor can ~ven I myself inform you where&#xD;
it is possible to meet a coin of less value. But list-&#xD;
en and obey me.&#xD;
On the other side of this mountain, there resides a&#xD;
prince, who is a sad dissolute young fellow. When&#xD;
he comes to the chase on the morrow, I will first&#xD;
withdraw him from his attendants, and then cause a&#xD;
frightful monster to fall upon him. Wait thou here&#xD;
till midnight, and then proceed, just as the moon rises&#xD;
above that jagged rock, towards that gloomy defile&#xD;
to the left, but neither hurry nor loiter in thy pace,&#xD;
so wilt thou arrive at the spot precisely as the mon-&#xD;
ster has seized the prince in his frightful paws. At-&#xD;
tack it, hut courageou~lYYit must yield to thee; and&#xD;
drive it (lown the steep cliff into the sea. Then, as&#xD;
a recompense for having delivered him, demand of&#xD;
the prince, that he cause two half-hellCi'S to be coin&#xD;
ed for thee; let me have them, in order that, with&#xD;
one, I may become the purchaser of thy bottle-&#xD;
deviX."&#xD;
So spoke the grisly horseman, and then, withoUt&#xD;
waiting for any reply, rode off slowly into the wood.&#xD;
106&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BOTTLE-IMP.&#xD;
"But where am Ito find thee when I have obtain-&#xD;
ed the haif-hellers?" cried out Richard.&#xD;
"At the black fountain; of which each old crone&#xD;
here about will be able to inform thee." And then&#xD;
with solemn, but wide outstretching pace, did the&#xD;
li~rrible steed bear away its no less terrific rider.&#xD;
He who has already lost nearly every thing, ven-&#xD;
tures not much by any further risk; Richard, there..&#xD;
fore, determined, as his situation was so desperate,&#xD;
to follow the counsels of the grisly spectre.&#xD;
Night closed in, and.the rising moon shortly after&#xD;
appeared above the craggy tops of the rocks which&#xD;
nad been marked out to him. The pale wanderer&#xD;
then raised himself tremblingly, and entered the&#xD;
dark defile. All seemed there cheerless and gloomy,&#xD;
t   seldom  was a pale moonbeam    able to penetrate&#xD;
above the lofty precipices; a dark oppressive vapour&#xD;
too, as if exhaled from graves, seemed to fill the nar-&#xD;
row pass; in other respects, there was nothing par-&#xD;
ticularly terrible in its appearance. Richard felt&#xD;
himself by no means disposed to linger in the gloomy&#xD;
valley, yet adhering to the strict injunction laid up-&#xD;
on him by the mysterious horseman, he did not ven-&#xD;
ture to quicken his pace, resolutely determined not&#xD;
to snap short at once the only slender thread that&#xD;
still attached him to light and hope.&#xD;
After the lapse of several hours, some red streaks&#xD;
of dawn cast a glimmering light across his path; a&#xD;
reviving breeze played upon his forehead. But,&#xD;
just as he was about to emerge from the deep valley,&#xD;
and to enjoy the forest scenery, and the azure waters&#xD;
of the sea, that lay expanded at no great distance&#xD;
before him, he was disturbed by a piercing cry of&#xD;
distress. On looking around, he perceived a horri-&#xD;
ble animal attacking a youth in a magnificent hunt-~&#xD;
ing dress, who had fallen on the ground. Richard's&#xD;
first impulse was to rush instantly to the stranger's&#xD;
rescue; yet his courage failed him as soon as he&#xD;
clearly discerned the monster, and saw that it re-&#xD;
seinbled a huge grisly baboon, with a stag's antJer~&#xD;
107&#xD;
&#xD;

on its forehead; and, ~0twjthsthndiflg the cries of&#xD;
the wretched man for succour, he was about to turn&#xD;
back. But suddenly calling to mind all that the&#xD;
horseman had said, and inspired by the dread of his&#xD;
eternal doom, he ran and attacked the monster of an&#xD;
ape with a knotty chib, just as it had seized the un~&#xD;
fortunate hunter in its paws to fling him up into 'the&#xD;
air, and then catch him upon his branching horns as&#xD;
he descended to the ground. At the approach of&#xD;
Richard, however, it let fall its prey, and began to&#xD;
flee with a hideous, terrifying cry; he pursuing it all&#xD;
the while, till, leaping from a precipice into the sea,&#xD;
it turned its frightful visage upon him, and then dis-&#xD;
appeared beneath the waves.&#xD;
Flushed with success, Richard now returned tri-&#xD;
umphantly to the hunter whom he had just rescued,&#xD;
and who, as he expected it would be, announced&#xD;
himself as the prince of that territory. After ex-&#xD;
t~ll~n~ethe bravery of his deliverer, he requeste(i&#xD;
t a would boldly demand whatever boon he&#xD;
should think fit.&#xD;
"What !" exclaimed Richard, in a transport of&#xD;
joyous hope, "and are you serious? and will you&#xD;
pledge me your princely word, that you will grant&#xD;
what I shall demand of you?"&#xD;
Again the prince confirmed his promise, assuring&#xD;
him, in the most solemn manner, that he would&#xD;
gladly comply with ~vhateVer he should request.&#xD;
"Then, I supplicate you, for the love of God, to&#xD;
order that some half~hellCr5 be immediately struck for&#xD;
me, even though it be only two." Whilst the prince&#xD;
was ~regarding his strange petitioner with fixed as-&#xD;
tonishment, some of his train came up, and, on hear-&#xD;
ing the adventure and the singular boon that had&#xD;
been craved, one of them recognized, in the persofl&#xD;
of the suitor, the poor crazed Half-keller.&#xD;
rrhe prince began, thereupon, to laugh, whilst&#xD;
Richard, clasping his knees, conjured him, in the&#xD;
most moving manner protesting that, unless he ob'~&#xD;
1Q~&#xD;
&#xD;
[,1&#xD;
&#xD;
THlE BIOTTLE-IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
tamed the Iialf-hellers, his soul was doomed to evc~&#xD;
lasting perdition.&#xD;
To this the prince replied, while he still continue~&#xD;
ed to laugh, "Rise up, my friend, I have j)ledged&#xD;
my princely word, and, if you persist in demanding&#xD;
them, I will engage to supply thee with haif-hellers&#xD;
to thy very heart's content. But, if a still lesser coin&#xD;
will suit your purpose, I can accommodate thee&#xD;
without the aid of my mint-master, for the neigh.&#xD;
boring provinces all maintain that my hellers ar~&#xD;
so light that three of them are requisite to pass for a&#xD;
single ordinary one."&#xD;
"VVere that indeed the case-" said Richard.&#xD;
"Thou art indeed the first," returned the prince,&#xD;
"that has ever doubted it. Should they, however,&#xD;
upon trial, prove not suitable for your purpose, I&#xD;
here promise to order some less valuable to be coined&#xD;
for thy espe use-provided, however, that it be&#xD;
possible so t 0."&#xD;
Having said this, he gave orders that Richard&#xD;
should forthwith receive a whole bag-full of hollers.&#xD;
The latter instantly set off at a furious rate towards&#xD;
the adjoining province, where he became more de-&#xD;
lighted than he had been with any occurrence for a&#xD;
longtime past, at finding, at the very first inn, that&#xD;
the people were exceedingly unwilling to exchange&#xD;
one heller in return for three which he offered them,&#xD;
by way of experiment.&#xD;
He now inquired his way towards the Black&#xD;
Fountain, when some children, who were present,&#xD;
ran away, shrieking with aifright; and the host in~&#xD;
formed him, not without shuddering himself, that it&#xD;
was a place frequented by demons an~ evil spirits,&#xD;
but hardly ever visited by mortal being. He knew&#xD;
perfectly well, however, that the entrance to it was&#xD;
at no very great distance, through a cavern, at the&#xD;
mouth of which stood two decayed cypress trees, so&#xD;
that Richard could not mistake finding it; "yet,&#xD;
God forbid, that he, or any other Christian person.&#xD;
should ever seek it!"&#xD;

At hearing this account, Richard was again&#xD;
greatly disturbed, but let the event be what it would,&#xD;
he must make the attempt, and therefore set out to&#xD;
discover it. Even at a distance, the cavern had a&#xD;
most dismal and terrifying appearance: it seemed as&#xD;
if the two cvpresses had ~died with horror, at the&#xD;
ghastly hollow, which, as he approached it, display-&#xD;
ed just above its mouth, a singular stone. It seemed&#xD;
to be entirely covered with grim countenances,&#xD;
some of which bore a resemblance to the hideous&#xD;
baboon-monster, on the sea-shore. Yet, en looking&#xD;
fearlessly and attentively, one might perceive that it&#xD;
was merely the rugged stone. Not without trem-&#xD;
bling, slid Richard pass beneath these horrible vis-&#xD;
ages. The bottle-imp now became so heavy in his&#xD;
pocket, that it seemed as if it wished to prevent his&#xD;
advancing further. This circumsta e inspired him.&#xD;
with courage to proceed: "for," t ht he, ~~it be-&#xD;
nooves me to do that which this cc atur~ wishes I&#xD;
should not do.." On penetrating farther into the&#xD;
cavern, the darkness became so great, that he could&#xD;
no longer discern any terrifying shapes. He now&#xD;
proceeded with the utmost caution, groping his way&#xD;
with a stick, lest he should fall into some abyss, yet&#xD;
found nothing but a soft mossy turf; and had he not&#xD;
heard at times, a strange groaning noise, his fears&#xD;
would have ceased altogether. At length, he reach-&#xD;
ed the outlet of the cavern. He now found himself&#xD;
in a dreary hollow, quite enclosed by steep hills.&#xD;
On one side, he perceived the large sable steed of&#xD;
the mysterious customer for~ his phial, which w~s&#xD;
standing motionless as a brazen statue. Oppsiteto&#xD;
him was a spring, gushing from the rock, and in this,&#xD;
the grim horseman was washing both his face and&#xD;
hands. But the horrid stream was of an inky hue,&#xD;
with which it stained whatever* it touched; for,&#xD;
when the gigantic figure turned round towards&#xD;
Richard, the latter perceived that his visage was be-&#xD;
come like that of a Moor, and thereby formed a ter&#xD;
rifle contrast against his blood-red garments.&#xD;
110&#xD;
&#xD;
1~&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BOTTLE-IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Shudder not," cried the hideous being, "this ig&#xD;
only one of the ceremonies which I am obliged to&#xD;
perform in honor of the devil. I am also compel-&#xD;
led to stain my garment afresh, with my own blood-&#xD;
it is this which gives it a hue of so much deadly lus-&#xD;
tre:-besides a number of' still more horrible cere-&#xD;
monies which I am obliged to undei~go. I have,&#xD;
moreover, formed so strong a compact with the pow~&#xD;
ers of darkness, both of body and soul, that it is now&#xD;
utterly impossible for me to obtain redemption on&#xD;
any terms. And what do you imagine are the terms&#xD;
on which I have sold myself?-for a hundred thou-&#xD;
sand pieces yearly. Thus seeing how des -erate is&#xD;
my own condition , still I am willing&#xD;
by purchasing the imp thou       to serve thee,&#xD;
carriest in thy phial,&#xD;
and thus to frustrate the end of all his long servitude;&#xD;
besides, the rescuing thee from the powers of hell,&#xD;
will so enrage them, that, reckless of ought else, I'll&#xD;
do it. Then how will their impotent curses peal&#xD;
through the vaults of deepest hell; ha! ha! ha!" So&#xD;
saying, he began to laugh in the most frightful man-&#xD;
ner, that the very rocks re-echoed, and the sable&#xD;
steed, which had hitherto stood motionless, seemed&#xD;
to shrink with terror at the awful sound.&#xD;
"Now then, friend," added he, after a while,&#xD;
hast thou brought me any half-hellers?"&#xD;
Upon Richard's showing him his piPse, he took&#xD;
three of the pieces, and gave him a belIer in ex-&#xD;
change; one of which he directly paid back again.&#xD;
as the purchase money for the bottle-devil, that now&#xD;
lay crouched up melancholy at the bottom of the&#xD;
phial, so that lie felt quite heavy. At I)erceiving this&#xD;
the unknown purchaser laughed again most violent-&#xD;
ly, and claimed, "Nothing can avail lhee, fiend;&#xD;
all resistance is in vain. In token, therefore, of thy&#xD;
obedience, let me have instantly as m~ich gold as my&#xD;
strong steed can hear." And no sooner had he ut-&#xD;
tered the command, than the enormous beast stood&#xD;
panting beneath the golden load. Then the blood.&#xD;
re(l horseman, having mounted on his back, it began&#xD;

MARVELLOUS REPOSITORY.&#xD;
to crawl up the perpendicular sides of the rock, ,just&#xD;
as a fly does up a wall-and disappeared for ever.&#xD;
Richard stood for some minutes fixed to the spA in&#xD;
a stu por of astonishment and joy: but the air of&#xD;
that Stygian recess seemed troublous and heavy,&#xD;
while a hollow voice, issuing from the dusky waves&#xD;
of the Black Fountain, exclaimed: "Now then are&#xD;
all our labours frustrated, for Le who, whde doomed&#xD;
to destruction, could attempt the rescue of another,&#xD;
may~evcn yet be saved himself." Struck with hor.&#xD;
ror at the sounds, although exulting at their import,&#xD;
flichard rushed through the cavern, tq feel again the&#xD;
atmosphere of heaven.&#xD;
He now felt assured that he was delivered of his&#xD;
evil fiend forever, and looked once more on the face&#xD;
of nature with feelings that had long been strangers&#xD;
to his bosom. Throwing himself upon the grass, he&#xD;
gazed in an ecstacy of delight on the pure, tranquil,&#xD;
sunny sky, while a warm gush of tears expressed&#xD;
that rapture and that gratitude, for which he could&#xD;
find nO words. The young merchant uio~ became&#xD;
light and gay as an innocent boy, yet without any&#xD;
thing resembling his former levity~ Without boast~&#xD;
ing, as he might well have done, how he had contrir.&#xD;
ed to outwit the powers of hell, he devoted himself&#xD;
henceforth, to the service of heaven, an~soon found&#xD;
himself thriving in far greater prosperitY, from the&#xD;
efforts of honest industry, than he had ever enjoyed&#xD;
by means of the fatal talisman. And, whenever he&#xD;
used afterwards to relate to his awe-struck grand-&#xD;
children, the adventures of his early days, after ut-&#xD;
tering a pious orison for the soul of his deliverer, he&#xD;
would add, by way of moral to his tale, " Lust not,&#xD;
my dear children, after ill-gotten and ill-to-be.-used&#xD;
mammon, for it is the Bottle-Imp, that serves us to&#xD;
our own destruction."&#xD;

k the year I~94, a young gentleman, whose faint.&#xD;
ly dwelt in the town of Sues, in Normandy, came to&#xD;
the university of Angiers, in order to study the 1aw~.&#xD;
There he saw Renee Corbeau, the daughter of a&#xD;
citizen of that place. This amiable girl was young,&#xD;
prudent, handsome, and witty. Though her parents&#xD;
were not rich, yet she inspired in the heart of the&#xD;
young student a passion so vehement, and love in-&#xD;
spired him with such eloquence, that, in a very short&#xD;
time their attachment became mutual, was so fer-&#xD;
vent, that in his transl)orts he offered to espouse her,&#xD;
and gay e her a solemn promise in writing. The&#xD;
young woman, agreeably deluded by his putting this&#xD;
paper into her hands, forfeited her honour. The&#xD;
consequence was, a child. Her parents reproached&#xD;
her in severe terms, and began to consult about the&#xD;
means by which her error might be repaired. The&#xD;
result of their deliberations was, that she should&#xD;
make her lover an appointment at their country.~&#xD;
house, and thus give her parents an opportunity of&#xD;
surprising them together.&#xD;
This scheme was effectually carried into execu-&#xD;
tion, and, while love possessed the heart of the young&#xD;
Inalnorato, lie gave the daughter a contract of mar~&#xD;
riage.&#xD;
The moment he had put his hand to this instru.q&#xD;
ment, it filled him with disgust. rp hose charms,&#xD;
which had pierced his heart a few hours before, now&#xD;
lost their force, and the fair one, from being the&#xD;
most lovely of her sex, now appeared the least agree~&#xD;

turned home to his father, to whom, without the least&#xD;
reserve, he related the unlucky event. The father&#xD;
was extremely chagrined at- this story of' his son's,&#xD;
and disapproving of' the match, he told him there&#xD;
was but one way left, and that, if he would regain&#xD;
his favour, he must follow it immediately. The&#xD;

perform his contract.&#xD;

e-ver, he appealed to the parliament of Paris, and the&#xD;
cause was moved to the Tournelle, where Monsieur&#xD;
de Villeroy at that time presided. On the hearing&#xD;
all parties, the behaviour of this young man appeared&#xD;
so gross, and .capable of so little alleviation, that the&#xD;
court decided that he should .either marry the wo-&#xD;
man or suffer de~ath. The first was impossible, be-&#xD;
cause he had taken 'orders; the court, therefore, di-&#xD;
rected that he should be led to execution. Accord-&#xD;
ingly, he was put into the hands of the executioner,&#xD;
and the confessor drew near, who was to assist him&#xD;
in his last moments. -Tlhen it was that Renee Cor-&#xD;
beau found her- bosom agitated with the most ex-&#xD;
quisite affliction, which was still heightened when&#xD;
she saw the pomp of justice about to take place, arid&#xD;
-Jer lover on the point of being led to the scaffold.&#xD;
Furious, through despair, and guided only by her&#xD;
passion, she rushed with such impetuosity through&#xD;
the crowd, that she got into the inner chamber be-&#xD;
f'ore the judges were separated, and then, her face&#xD;
bathed in tears, and all in disorder, she addressed&#xD;

&#xD;
them in the following terms. " Behold ! my Lords&#xD;
the most unfortuate lover that ever appeared before&#xD;
the face of justice., In condemning him I love, you&#xD;
seem to suppose that either I am not guilty of any&#xD;
thing, or that, at least, my crime is capable of' ex-&#xD;
cuse, and yet you adjudge me to death, which must&#xD;
befall me with the same stroke that takes away my&#xD;
lover. You subject me to the most grievoUs destiny,&#xD;
for the infamy of my lover's death will fall upon me,&#xD;
and I shall go to my grave more dishonoured than&#xD;
him. You desire to repair the injury done to my&#xD;
honour, and the remedy you bring will load me with&#xD;
eternal shame; so that at the moment you give your&#xD;
opinion, that I am rather unhappy than criminal,&#xD;
you are pleased to punish me with the rmost severe&#xD;
4and most intolerable pains. How agrees your&#xD;
Treatment of me with your equity, and with the rules&#xD;
[of that humane justice which should direct your&#xD;
Court? You cannot be ignorant of the hardship I&#xD;
Sustain; for you were men before you were judges.&#xD;
SYou must have been sensible of the power of love,&#xD;
Sand you cannot but have sorne idea of the torment&#xD;
which must be felt in a breast, where the rememi-&#xD;
brance dwells of having caused the death, the infa-&#xD;
mous death, of the (lear object of her love. Can&#xD;
there be a punishment equal to this; or, after it,&#xD;
could death be considered in any other light than&#xD;
as the highest blessing of heaven?&#xD;
"Stay ! Oh, stay, my Lords1 I am going to&#xD;
open your eyes. I am going to acknowledge my&#xD;
fault, to reveal my secret crime, which hitherto I&#xD;
have concealed, that, if possible, the marriage of my&#xD;
lover might have restored my blasted honour. But,&#xD;
urged now by remorse of conscience, I am constrain-&#xD;
ed to confess that [ seduced him. Yes, my Lords,&#xD;
I loved first! It was I that, to gratify my passion,&#xD;
informed him of my attachment, and thus I made&#xD;
myself the instrument of my own dishonour. Change&#xD;
then, my Lords, the sentiments you have hitherto&#xD;
entertained of this affair. Look upon me as the se-.&#xD;

ducer; on my lover as the person injured; punish&#xD;
me; save him. If justice is inexorable, and there i~&#xD;
a necessity for some victim, let it be me.&#xD;
"You look upon it as a crime lhat he took holy~&#xD;
orders, and thereby rendered it impossible for him to&#xD;
comply with his contract; hut this was not his own&#xD;
act; it was the act of a barbarous father, whose I&#xD;
rannous commands~ he could not resist. A will in&#xD;
subjection, my Lords, is no will at all to deserve&#xD;
punishment. The offender must be his father&#xD;
could only he guilty; and were he not the father oC&#xD;
my love, I would demand justice of you on him. Is&#xD;
it not clear then, my Lords, that your last sentence&#xD;
contradicts your first? You decreed that he should&#xD;
have his choice to marry me, or to die, and yet you&#xD;
never put the first in his power. How odious must&#xD;
I appear in your eyes, when you choos~ rather to&#xD;
put a man to death, than to allow him to marry me.&#xD;
He has declared that his present condition will not&#xD;
allow him to marry, and, in consequence of this de-&#xD;
claration, yju have condemned him to death; but&#xD;
what signifies that declaration; his meaning was,&#xD;
that he would have married me if he could, and if so,&#xD;
your sentence is unjust; for, by your former decree,&#xD;
he was to have his option. But you will say, a&#xD;
priest can't marry. Ah! my Lords, love has taught&#xD;
me better. Love brings things instantly to our&#xD;
minds that may be of service to the object of our&#xD;
loves. The Pope, my Lords, can (liSj)CnSe with his&#xD;
vow you cannot be ignorant of this, ~n(1 therefore&#xD;
his choice may he yet in hi~ power. We. expect&#xD;
every moment tbe legate of his holiness; he has all&#xD;
the plenitude of power delegated to him, which is in&#xD;
the sovereign pontiffi 'I will solicit him for this dis-&#xD;
pensation, and my passion telisme, that I shall not&#xD;
plead in vain; for what obstacle will it nQt be able&#xD;
to surmount, when it has overcome that of your de~&#xD;
cree. Have pity then, my Lords! Have pity on&#xD;
two unfortunate lovers~ mitigate your sentence, or,&#xD;

gate for a dispensation. You look or, my lover, it is&#xD;
true, as a man guilty~of a great crime; but what&#xD;
crime too great to be expiated by the horrors he has&#xD;
already sustained? Has he not felt a thousand&#xD;
times the pains of death since the pronouneing~his&#xD;
sentence? Besides, could you enter into my breast,&#xD;
and conceive what torments I have endured, you&#xD;
would think our fault, foul as it is, f.ullv atoned. I.&#xD;
see among your Lordships some w;ho are young, and&#xD;
some who are advanced in year~; the first cannot-&#xD;
sure, have their~breasts already steeled against the&#xD;
emotions of a passion natural to their sex; and I may&#xD;
hope the latter have not forgotten the tender senti-&#xD;
merits of their junior years. From both I have a&#xD;
right to pity; and if the voices for m~ are few, let&#xD;
the humanity of their sentiments prevail against the&#xD;
number of their opponents~ But if all I have said is&#xD;
Vain, at least afford me the melancholy pleasure of&#xD;
sharing his punishment, as I shared his crime. In&#xD;
this, ni~r Lords, be strictly just; and, as we have&#xD;
lived, let us die, together."&#xD;
This amiable woman was heard with equal silence&#xD;
and compassion; there wa~ not a word lo~t of her&#xD;
discourse, which she pronounced with a. voice so&#xD;
clear, an(l with a tone so expressive of her affliction,&#xD;
that it struck to the heai'ts of the .judg~. Her&#xD;
beauty, her tears, her eloquence, had charms too&#xD;
powerful not to incline the most frozen hearts to&#xD;
think with her. The judges receded unanimously&#xD;
from their opinions. Monsieut de Villeroy, having&#xD;
collected their sentiments, and declared that he&#xD;
agreed with them, proceeded to suspend the last&#xD;
edict, and to allow the criminal six ri~onths to apply&#xD;
for a dispensation.&#xD;

was the great Cardinal de Medicis, afterwards Pope,&#xD;
by the name of Clex~ent the Eleventh, though he&#xD;
enjoyed the chair not q~iite a month. He beard the&#xD;

Renee Corbeau had a passion too strong to he&#xD;
overcome; she threw herself at the feet of the king,&#xD;
Henry the Fourth. He heard her with attention,&#xD;
answered with tenderness, and, going to the legate&#xD;
in person, requested the dispensation in such terms,&#xD;
that it could not be refused. He had the goodness&#xD;

DEAN SWIFT'S BALLAD ON A MURDER.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ix the year 17%, Catherine Hayes murdered he,&#xD;
husband, under circumstances of the most horribJe&#xD;
description. After she and two men, who were h&#xD;
accomplices, had killed him with a hatchet, they cut&#xD;
off his head and threw it into the Thames, in order&#xD;
to conceal their crime; but God, who seeth in secret,&#xD;
made the murder manifest, and all the parties were&#xD;
taken. One of the men, Wood, died in l)rison; the&#xD;
other, Billings, was executed, and then hung in&#xD;
chains. Catharine Hayes was condemned to be&#xD;
burnt, and, on the day of execution, being brought&#xD;
to the stake, was chained thereto with an iron chain,&#xD;
running round her waist, and under her arms, and a&#xD;
rope round her neck, which was drawn through a&#xD;
~boIe in the post; then the faggots, intermixed with&#xD;
light brush-wood and straw, being piled all round&#xD;
her, the executioner put fir~ thereto in several&#xD;
places, which immediately blazing out, as soon as&#xD;
the same reached her, she with her arms pushed&#xD;
down those ~~hieh were before her, when she ap-&#xD;

peered in the middle of the flames as low as the&#xD;
waist; upon which the executioner got hold of the&#xD;
end of the cord which was round her neck, and pull..&#xD;
ed it tight, in order to strangle her, but the fire soon&#xD;
reached his hand, and burned it, so that he was&#xD;
obliged to let it go again; more faggots were imme-&#xD;
diately throivo upon her, and in about three or four&#xD;
hours she was reduced to ashes, Horrible as this&#xD;
murder was, and the annals of crime scarcely pre-&#xD;
sent its parallel, Dean Swift made it the subject of a&#xD;
punning ballad, of which the following is a copy.&#xD;

IT was towards the close of a hot day in the re-&#xD;
markable summer of '93, that Major Nicholas Vea-&#xD;
zie, landlord of a public house, in the village, of&#xD;
Coonsbury, sat puffing in his arm-chair, nearly eaten&#xD;
up by green headed flies. He was a thick-set, hard-&#xD;
breathing little man, somewhat inclined to corpu-&#xD;
lency, who did nothing but doze and gape from one&#xD;
year's end to another. To-be-sure, the Blue Griffin&#xD;
was not overburthened with travellers, but this was&#xD;
a circumstance unregarded by the Major, so long as&#xD;
he was allowed to slumber in peace. He was natu-&#xD;
rally a patient, phlegmatical personage, but in the&#xD;
depth of summer when the thermometer was at 90 in&#xD;
the snade, and there was not sufficient air abroad to&#xD;
fill the sails of a gossamer, and especially when the&#xD;
flies nearly picked the flesh from his bones, he&#xD;
was apt to grow som-ewvhat querulous. Such was&#xD;
the condition of his mind at-the commencement of&#xD;
our story. He had sweltered in his chair for mores&#xD;
than an hour, but to sleep-as well might a fish sleep&#xD;
on a heated gridiron, with a scullion sprinkling him&#xD;
over -with salt ! It was a wretched situation, and&#xD;
Veazic could hold out no longer. "~ Blast the flies,&#xD;
.and the hag that makes them.," said he', springing&#xD;
up and dislodging a blue-bottle from the very pene-&#xD;
tralia of his ear; ' but I'll pay her for it yet, curse&#xD;
me !" and, proceeding to the bar, he helped himself&#xD;
to a composing draught.&#xD;

While mine host is drinking his liquor, we would&#xD;
inform the reader, that just on the skirts of Coonsbury,&#xD;
in a grove of savings and barberry bushes, stood the&#xD;
solitary hut oCone Becky Mullen. She was a grizzly&#xD;
old crone, of most fantastic appearance, that hover-&#xD;
ed about the village in hot weather like a dusty-mil-&#xD;
ler round a candle. For a time, people were cx&#xD;
tremely puzzle ~ what to make of here She pretend-&#xD;
ed to live by drying herbs and distilling rose-water,&#xD;
but this tale was generally discredited. It was re-&#xD;
marked that she regularly disappeared when the,&#xD;
cold weather set in at autumn, and was not again&#xD;
heard of till the swallows twittered about the eaves&#xD;
of the cottages, and the hum of the summer insects&#xD;
was heard in the land. She would then suddenly&#xD;
reappear near her hut, like a person very busy in&#xD;
some secret employment; what it was, no one could&#xD;
imagine, although from the lights in her house it&#xD;
was thought she labored at it the greater part of&#xD;
the night. But time unfolded the mystery. It was&#xD;
whispered one day, in the bar-room of the iBlue&#xD;
Griffin, that Becky Mullen was employed by the Old&#xD;
Scratch to manufacture green headed flies. No&#xD;
sooner was the idea suggested than all present were&#xD;
convinced of its accuracy. The swamp beyond her&#xD;
hut was always thronged with hornets, musquetoes,&#xD;
an(l Jevil's.needles; no green-headed flies had ever&#xD;
been seen in the place before she settled in it; peo-&#xD;
ple who passed her dwelling in the evening, had&#xD;
conceited they heard a strange humming noise in&#xD;
the surrounding bushes; and moreover, Deacon&#xD;
Rosebug averred that he had that very day knocked&#xD;
an enormous horse-fly from the back of his white&#xD;
pony, which flew off in a strait line towards Becky&#xD;
Mullen's. The fact, however~ was soon after esta-&#xD;
blished beyond a doubt, by a swearing fellow named~&#xD;
Muggins, who affirmed, with a shocking oath, that&#xD;
he once went into her hut when she was out, ~nd&#xD;
saw a w'mh-tub fall of horse-flies and devil's~needles&#xD;
without any legs or wings; "and there was one&#xD;

green-headed fly," said he, "as large as a horn-bug,&#xD;
with his head in a vise, all finished except screwing&#xD;
on his bill. Dang-me if it did not make my blood&#xD;
run cold !" Thus Becky Mullen became notorious&#xD;
as the Devil's Fly-maker all over the country, and&#xD;
summer after summer continued to torment the in no-&#xD;
cent villagers of Coonsbury. But Major Veazie had&#xD;
acquired the particular ill-will of the old hag, by re-&#xD;
fusing to arise from his chair to sel fl~r a glass of&#xD;
gin. She vowed to be revenged on him, and ever&#xD;
since his house had been a general rendezvous for&#xD;
insects of every kind.&#xD;
"However, the devil will have her at last," saia&#xD;
mine host, as he sat down the glass and returned to&#xD;
his seat by the window, "there is some comfort in&#xD;
that, curse her!" and throwing a bandanna over hi~&#xD;
bald head to protect it from the flies, he again made&#xD;
the most persevering efforts to sleep.&#xD;
And now the day drew near its termination. Na&#xD;
ture, as if wearied with protracted exertion, seemed&#xD;
gradually sinking to a voluptuous repose. The sun&#xD;
no longer beat fiercely down on the parched earth,&#xD;
but enveloped in a smoky vapour, gave to the atmo-&#xD;
sphere a thick and stonelike heat. Not a breath of&#xD;
air was stirring. The toad puffed out his sides with&#xD;
great difficulty in his close retreat, and the asth-&#xD;
matic grass..hopper wheezed faintly amongst the&#xD;
grass. A few cows stood midleg in the cool waters&#xD;
of the Pun kapog, munching like tobacco-chewers,&#xD;
and lazily fanning themselves with their tails; and no&#xD;
sound was heard save the creak of a gossiping tea~&#xD;
table as it rubbed along the floor to the centre of the&#xD;
room. Mine hcst was aware that his hour of rest had&#xD;
at last arrived. He could distinctly feel a refreshing&#xD;
snooze stealing sweetly over his senses, like the rip-&#xD;
ple of a summer breeze along the motionless sea.&#xD;
1'h6 whizzing of the flies came fainter on i'is ear,&#xD;
~nd finally ceased. A moment after he recovered&#xD;
his conscious~e~j~, and was amazed to find, by the&#xD;
dryness of his throat, how long he had slept. 1Ja~ti&#xD;

ly removing the handkerchief from his face, he cast&#xD;
his eyes towards the west and beheld the last streaks&#xD;
of sunlight fading from the horizon, ~vhen~ bustling&#xD;
into the kitchen, he soon dispatched his evening&#xD;
meal and was a'~ain at his scat to recruit after the&#xD;
fatigue.&#xD;
As the shades of evening grew deep and deeper,&#xD;
the villagers in their thin summer jackets flocked in-&#xD;
to the Blue Griffin to converse on the marvels of the&#xD;
day. Here sat a swaggering bull-necked fellow,&#xD;
who, if you would believe him, was the richest man&#xD;
in the whole world; there leaned a rosy-gilled ba-&#xD;
chelor of sixty-four, who had never ventured out ~f&#xD;
the sight of his father's chimney during his long and&#xD;
useless life. That arm-chair contained a worthy&#xD;
lawyer, who hum-ed and haa-ed and hesitated at&#xD;
every (juest ion; and in this sat Deacon Rosebug, the&#xD;
horse-doctor and apothecary. Close by, was the&#xD;
tailor frowning at a hard drawing long-nine, and&#xD;
beside birfi stood a bandy-legged shoemaker, who&#xD;
was eternally complaining of the wickedness of man-&#xD;
kind. times we have, neighbour Veazie,'~&#xD;
6~&#xD;
grunted the pursy bachelor wiping his forehead&#xD;
with his sleeve.&#xD;
"1 never perspired so much in my born days," ad-&#xD;
ded a small white-headed man in a piping tone. "I&#xD;
swaggers, my bench got so hot this afternoon that I&#xD;
was nearly (Iried to a cinder."&#xD;
"How remarkable plenty the flies are to-night,&#xD;
Deacon Rosebug!"&#xD;
"So I was ju~t a going to observe. They nip like&#xD;
biting-turtles! I don't wonder the Major sits un~&#xD;
easy."&#xD;
"What a heartless wretch Beck Mullen must be,"&#xD;
exclaimed the man in gingham, "to persecute him&#xD;
in this manner!"&#xD;
"Curse her!" muttered the Major, opening his&#xD;
eyes and staring wildly around. "But I won't put&#xD;

"But, Major, they can't drive her. She has the&#xD;
lawon her side and the devil too, which, I take it,&#xD;
Squire Summ~ris, is about the same thing?"&#xD;
"Why -ahern------aha-.--the----hum-m"-&#xD;
"What is permitted cannot be gain-sayed," in-&#xD;
terrupted the shoemaker, "If so be as she is placed&#xD;
here for a judgment on this sinful world, she wont go&#xD;
without-"&#xD;
"But she s4all go," said the Major, kindling with&#xD;
passion. "I wont feast any body's flies, damme !"&#xD;
This magnanimous resolution was succeeded by a&#xD;
dead silence, which was only broken by a heavy&#xD;
rumbling sound in the distance.&#xD;
"Was that thunder?" inquired the tailor, in a&#xD;
quavering tone. Deacon Rosebug stepped to the&#xD;
door. "There's the blackest cloud I ever saw, driving&#xD;
towards us from the west. I though&#xD;
would bring up a shower."        this weather&#xD;
He had scarcely ceased speaking, when a flash of&#xD;
lightning gleamed through the windows and filled&#xD;
the room with the light of day. Again the heavy&#xD;
rambling ~vas~ heard louder and nearer, and it con-&#xD;
tinned to increase until the whole party, in alarm,&#xD;
crowded to the door, Suddenly a carriage whirled&#xD;
round a corner of the road, with a tremendous noise,&#xD;
and'drove rapidly towards the inn. The darkness&#xD;
prevented them from distinguishing any~ thing but&#xD;
two advancing balls of fi they concluded it&#xD;
was some stage, which had ~ up its lamps and was&#xD;
hurrying on to avoid the storm. But before they&#xD;
could express an opinion, the Vehicle drove up like&#xD;
lightning and stopped short at the door step. A&#xD;
sight then met their eyes which made them ache&#xD;
with terror. Two enormous pepper and salt horses&#xD;
stood reeking with foam and gasping for breath,&#xD;
while myriads of flies hovered around, and settled&#xD;
in clouds upon them. In a light chair to which the~r&#xD;
were fixed, a la tandem, sat a tall figure, the like of&#xD;

guise of a sophomore, and was probably the King&#xD;

whole party had retreated, "Give me some drink,"&#xD;
he cried, in the buzzing tone of a horn-bug, at the&#xD;

jug of' J-Iollands was eagerly handed him by mine&#xD;
host, who had taken refuge behind the grating of&#xD;
the bar. The stranger emptied it at ~draught, and&#xD;
spitefully tossed the jug at mine host's head, who&#xD;
(lodged and fell backwards into a barrel-cover filled&#xD;
with treacle to catch flies. "And now," exclaimed&#xD;
he, snapping his eyes till they glowed like a furnace,&#xD;
"and now'Tor old aunt Beck." Springing into his&#xD;

MR. FORBEs, in his Oriental Memoirs, states&#xD;
Ahe following curious facts :-On his arrival at Dhu-&#xD;
boy, while the durbar was repairing, he resided in a&#xD;
house, the back part of which was separated by a&#xD;
narrow court from that of a principal Hindoo; this&#xD;
being a shady side, he usually retired to aiveranda&#xD;
there during jhe heat of the afternoon; and reposed.&#xD;
on a sofa with his book. Here small pieces of mor-&#xD;
tar and tiles frequently fell about him, to which he&#xD;
Imid no attention, till one day the annoyance became&#xD;
considerable, and a blow from a larger piece of the&#xD;
than usual, made him turn to discover the cause"&#xD;
the opposite roof was covered with monkeys; they&#xD;
had taken a dislike to his complexion, and had com-&#xD;
menced a system of hostilities which left the govern&#xD;
or no alternative but that of changing his lodgings;&#xD;
for, he says, he could neither make reprisals nor ex~&#xD;

commences they are all turnedl and adjusted; being&#xD;
placed in order then they keep the house dry while&#xD;

IN that almost insulated part of the state of Massa-&#xD;
chusetti, called Old Colonm/, or Plydouth Colony,&#xD;
and particularly in a small village adjoining the&#xD;
shire town, there may be found the relics of many&#xD;
old customs and supeCrstitions, which would be&#xD;
amusing, at least to the antiquary. Among others&#xD;
of less serious cast, there was, fifteen years ago, one&#xD;
which, on account of its peculiarity and its conse-&#xD;
quences, I bieg leave to mention.&#xD;
It is well known to those who are acquainted with&#xD;
that section of our country, that nearly'one half of&#xD;
its inhabitants die of a consumption, occasioned by&#xD;
the chilly humidity of their atmosphere, and the&#xD;
Long prevalence of"asterly winds. The inhabitants&#xD;
of the village to which I alude were peculiarly ex-&#xD;
posed to this scourge; and I have seen, at one time,&#xD;
one in every fifty of its inhabitants gliding down to&#xD;
the grave with all the certainty which characterizes&#xD;
this insidious foe of the human family.&#xD;
There was fifteen years ago, and is perhaps at this&#xD;
time, an opinion prevalent among the inhabitants&#xD;
of this town, that the body of a person who had&#xD;
died of a consumption, was, by some supernatural&#xD;
means, nourished in the grave, from the body of&#xD;
some one living member of the family; and that,&#xD;
during the life of this person, the body retained in&#xD;
the grave, all the fullness and freshness of life and&#xD;
health.&#xD;
This belief was strengthened by the , ircumstance,&#xD;
that whole families frequently fell a pr~y to this ter-&#xD;
rible disease. Of one large family in this town, con-&#xD;
Listing of fourteen children, and their venerable pa-&#xD;
rents, the mother and the youngest son only remain-&#xD;
ed--the rest within a year of each ether had died of&#xD;
a consumption.&#xD;

teenth child, anaamiable girl of about 16 years of age,&#xD;
the bloom, owhich characterized the whole of this&#xD;
family, was seen to fade from the cheek of the last&#xD;
supporter of the heart-smitten mother, and his broad&#xD;
flat chest was occasionally convulsed by that power-&#xD;
ful deep toned rough which attends the consump-&#xD;
tion in our Atlantic states.      .    .,&#xD;
At this time, as if to snatch one of this family from&#xD;
an early grave, it was resolved, by a few of the in.&#xD;
habitants of the village, .to test the truth of this tra-&#xD;
dition which I have mentioned, and which the cir-&#xD;
cumstances of this afflicted family seemed to confirm.&#xD;
I should have added that it was believed that if the&#xD;
body, thus unnaturally nourished in the grave,&#xD;
should be raised and turned over in the coffin, its&#xD;
depredation upon the survivor would necessarily&#xD;
cease. Trhe consent of the mother being obtained,&#xD;
it was agreed that four persons, attended by the sur-&#xD;
viving and complaining brother, should, at sunrise&#xD;
the next day, dig up the remains of the last buried&#xD;
sister. At the appointed -hour, they attended in the&#xD;
burying yard, and having, with much exertion, re-&#xD;
moved the earth, they raised the coffin and placed it&#xD;
upon the ground; then, displacing the flat lid, they&#xD;
lifted the covering from her face, and discovered&#xD;
what they had, indeed, anticipated but dreaded to&#xD;
declare.-Yes, I saw the visage of one who had long&#xD;
been the tenant of a silent grave, lit up with the&#xD;
brilliancy of youthful health.-The cheek was full to&#xD;
dimpling;- and a rich profusion of hair shaded her&#xD;
cold forehead, while some of its richest curls floated&#xD;
upon her unconscious breast. The large blue eye&#xD;
had scarcely lost its brilliancy, and the living full-&#xD;
ness of her lips seemed almost to say, ",Ioose mec and&#xD;
let me go."&#xD;

tacle he had witnessed, sunk under his disease-.&#xD;

Ouu ship, after touching at the Cape, went out&#xD;
again, and soon losing sight of the Table Mountain,&#xD;
1)egan to be assailed by the impetuous attacks of the&#xD;
sea, which is well known to he more formidable&#xD;
there than in most parts of the known ocean. The&#xD;
day had grown dull and hazy, and the breeze, which&#xD;
had formerly blown fresh, now sometimes subsided&#xD;
almost entirely, and then recovering its strength, for&#xD;
a short time, and changing its direction, blew with&#xD;
temporary violence, and died away again, as if exer-&#xD;
cising a melancholy caprice. A heavy swell began&#xD;
to come from the south-east. Our sails flapp&amp;amp;&#xD;
against the masts, and the ship rolled from side to&#xD;
side, as heavily as if she had been water-logged.&#xD;
There was so little wind that she would not steer.&#xD;
At two P. M. we had a squall, accompanied by&#xD;
thunder and rain. The seamen, growing restless,&#xD;
looked tinxiously a-head. They said we would have&#xD;
a (lirty night of it, and that it would not be worth&#xD;
while to turn into their hammocks. As the second&#xD;
mate was describing a gale he had encountered oft'&#xD;
Cape Race, Newfoundland we were suddenly taken&#xD;
all a-back, and the blast came upon us furiously&#xD;
We continued to scud under a double-reefed main-&#xD;
sail and foretop-sail till dusk; but, as the sea ran&#xD;
high, the captain thought it safest to bring her to.&#xD;
The watch on deck consisted of four men, one of&#xD;
whom was appointed to keep a look-out a-head, for&#xD;
the weather was so hazy, that we could not see two&#xD;

cables' length from the bows. This man, whose&#xD;
name was Tom Willis, xvent frequently to the bows,&#xD;
as if to observe something; and when the others call-&#xD;
ed to him, inquiring what he was looking at, he&#xD;
would give no definite answer. They, therefore,&#xD;
went also to the bows, and appeared startled, and at&#xD;
first said nothing; but presently one of them cried,&#xD;
"William, go call the watch."&#xD;
Thc seamen, having been asleep in their ham-&#xD;
mocks, murmured at this unreasonable surhmons,&#xD;
and called to know how it looked upon deck. To&#xD;
which Tom Willis replied, "Come up and see.&#xD;
What we are mingling is not on deck, but a-head."&#xD;
On hearing this, they ran up without putting on&#xD;
their jackets, and when they came to the bows, there&#xD;
was a whispering.&#xD;
One of them asked, "Where is she? I do not see&#xD;
her." To which another replied, "The last flash&#xD;
of lightning showed there was not a reef in one of&#xD;
her sails; but we, who know her history, know that&#xD;
all her canvas will never carry her into port."&#xD;
By this time, the talking of the seamen had&#xD;
brought some of the passengers on deck. They&#xD;
could see nothing, however, for the ship was sur-&#xD;
rounded by thick darkness, and by the noise of the&#xD;
dashing waters, and the seamen evaded the ques..&#xD;
tions that were put to them.&#xD;
At this juncture the chaplain came on deck. He&#xD;
was a man of grave, and modest demeanour, and was&#xD;
much liked among the seamen, who called him Gen-&#xD;
tie George. He overheard one of the men asking&#xD;
another, "If he had ever seen the Flying Dutchman&#xD;
before, and if he knew the story about her?" To&#xD;
which the other replied, "I have heard of her beat-&#xD;
ing about in these seas. What is the reason she&#xD;
never reaches port?"&#xD;
The first speaker replied, "They give different rea-&#xD;
sons for it, but my story is this: 'She was an Amster-&#xD;
dam vessel, and sailed from that port seventy years&#xD;
ago. Her master's name was Vanderdecken. lie&#xD;

was a staunch seaman, and would have his own way,&#xD;
in spite of the devil. For all that, never a sailor un~&#xD;
der him had reason fo complain; though how it is on&#xD;
board with them now, nobody knows. The story is&#xD;
this: that in doubling the Cape, they were a long&#xD;
day trying to weather the Table Bay, which we saw&#xD;
this morning. However, the wind head~cl them,&#xD;
and went against them more and more, and Vander..&#xD;
Thicken walked the deck, swearing at the wind. Just&#xD;
after sunset, a vessel spoke him, asking him if he&#xD;
did not mean to go into the bay that night. Van der-.&#xD;
decken replied, 'May 1 be eternally d-d if I do,&#xD;
though I should beat about here till the day of judg-&#xD;
menU' And to be sure, Vanderdecken never did go&#xD;
into that bay; for it is believed that he continues to&#xD;
beat about in these seas still, and will do so long&#xD;
enough. This vessel is never seen but with foul&#xD;
weather along with her."&#xD;
To which another replied, "We must keep clear&#xD;
of her. They say that her captain mans his jolly&#xD;
boat, when a vessel comes in sight, and tries hard to&#xD;
get along-side, to put letters on hoard, hut no good&#xD;
comes to Ihem who have communication with him."&#xD;
Tom Willis said, "There is such a sea between&#xD;
us at present, as should keep us safe from such&#xD;
visits."&#xD;
To which the other answered, "We cannot trust&#xD;
to that if Vanderdecken sends out his men."&#xD;
Some of this conversation having been overhead&#xD;
by the passengers, there w~s a commotion among&#xD;
them. In the mean time, the noise of the waves&#xD;
against the vessel could scarcely be distinguished&#xD;
from the sounds of t he distant thunder. The wind&#xD;
had extinguished the light in the binnacle, where&#xD;
the compass was, and no one could tell which way&#xD;
the ship's head lay. The passengers were afraid to&#xD;
ask questions, lest they should augment the secret&#xD;
sensation of fear which chilled every heart, or&#xD;
learn any more than they already knew. For while&#xD;
they attributed their ag~tat~on of mind to the state&#xD;

of the weather, it was sufficiently perceptible that&#xD;
their alarms also arose from a cause which they did&#xD;
not acknowledge.&#xD;
The lamp at the binnacle being re-lighted, they&#xD;
perceived that the ship lay closer to the wind than&#xD;
she had hitherto done, and the spirits of the passen-&#xD;
geTs were somewhat revived.&#xD;
Nevertheless, neither the tempestuous state of the&#xD;
atmosphere nor the thunder had ceased; and soon a&#xD;
vivid flash of lightning showed the waves tumbling&#xD;
around, and, in the distance, the Flying Dutchman&#xD;
scudding furiously before the wind, under a j~1'ess of&#xD;
canvas. The sight was but momentary, but it was&#xD;
sufficient to remove all (loubt from the minds (if the&#xD;
passengers. One of the men cried alouC, "There&#xD;
she goes, top-gallants and all."&#xD;
The chaplain had brought up his pi'ayC2-bOOk, in&#xD;
order that he might draw from thence something to&#xD;
fortify and tranquilize the minds of the rest. There-&#xD;
fore, taking his seat near the binnacle, so that the&#xD;
light shone upon the white leaves of the hook, he, in&#xD;
a solemn tone, read out the service for those distress&#xD;
ed at sea. The sailors stood round him with folded&#xD;
arms, and looked as if they thought it would he of&#xD;
little use. But this served to occupy the attention&#xD;
of those on deck for a while.&#xD;
In the mean time, the flashes of lightning becom-&#xD;
ing less vivid, ~howed nothing else, far or near, hut&#xD;
the billows weltering r~nd the vessel. The sailors&#xD;
seemed to think that they had not yet seen the worst,&#xD;
but confined their remarks and prognosticationS to&#xD;
their pwn circle.&#xD;
At this time, the captain, who had hitherto re-&#xD;
mained in his birth, came on deck, and with a gay&#xD;
arid unconcerned air, inquired what was the cause&#xD;
of the general dread. He said he thought they had&#xD;
already seen the worst of the weather, and wondered&#xD;
that his men had raised such a hubbub ahout a cap-&#xD;
ful of wind. Mention being made of the Flying&#xD;
Dutchman, the captain laughed He said, "he&#xD;
136&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.&#xD;
would like very much to see any vessel carrying top~&#xD;
gallant sails in such a night, for it would be a sight&#xD;
worth looking at." The chaplain, taking him b~'&#xD;
one of the buttons of his coat, drew him aside, an~&#xD;
appeared to enter into serious conversation with him.&#xD;
While they were talking together, the cal)tain&#xD;
was heard to say, "Let us look to our own ship, and&#xD;
not mind such things;" and accordingly, he sent a&#xD;
man aloft, to see if all was right about the fore top..&#xD;
sail yard, which was chafing the mast with a loud&#xD;
noise~.&#xD;
It was Tom Willis wh6 went lip; an(l when he&#xD;
came (lown, he said that all was tight, and that he&#xD;
hoped it would soon get clearer; and that they would&#xD;
see no more of what they were most afraid of.&#xD;
The captain and first mate were heard laughing&#xD;
loudly together, while the chaplain observed, that it&#xD;
would he better to repress such unseasonable gaiety.&#xD;
The second mate, a native of Scotland, whose name&#xD;
was Duncan Saunderson, having attende(1 one of the&#xD;
University classes at Aberdeen, thought himself too&#xD;
wise to believe all that the sailors said, anti took part&#xD;
with the captain. He jestingly told Tom Willis to&#xD;
l)orrow his grandam's spectacles the next time he was&#xD;
sent to keep a look-out a-head. Tom walked sulki-&#xD;
ly away, muttering that he would nevertheless trust&#xD;
to his own eyes till morning, and accordingly took&#xD;
his station at the bow, and appeared to watch as at-&#xD;
tentively as before.&#xD;
The sound of talking soon ceased, for many re-&#xD;
turned to their births, and we heard nothing hut the&#xD;
clanking of the ropes upon the masts, and the burst-&#xD;
ing of the billows a-head, as the vessel successively&#xD;
took the seas.&#xD;
But after a considerable interval of darkness,&#xD;
gleams of lightning began to re-appear. Tom Wril~&#xD;

flash of lightning shone far and wide over the raging&#xD;
sea, and showed us not only the Flying Dutchman&#xD;
at a distance, but also a boat coming from her with&#xD;
four men. The boat was within two cables' length&#xD;
of our ship's side.&#xD;
The man who first saw her ran to the captain, and&#xD;
asked whether they should hail her or not. 'I he&#xD;
captainl, walking about in great agitation, madeC no&#xD;
reply. The first mate cried, "Who's going to heave&#xD;
a rope to that boat ?" The men looked. at leach&#xD;
other, without offering to do any- thing. The boat&#xD;
had come very near the chains, when Torn Willis&#xD;
called out. " What do you want? or what the (de-&#xD;
vil has blown you here in such weather?" A pierc-&#xD;
ing voice from the boat, replied in English, " We&#xD;
want to speak with your captain." The captain&#xD;
took no notice of this, and Vanderdecken's boat&#xD;
having come close along side, one ,of the men came&#xD;
Upon (leck,"and appeared like a fatigued and weath-&#xD;

Our sailors -all dre0W back. The chaplain, how&#xD;
ever, looking stedfastly upon him, went forward a&#xD;
few steps, and asked, "What is the purpose of this&#xD;
visit ?"&#xD;
The stranger replied, " We have long been kept&#xD;
here by foul weather, and Vanderdecken wishes to&#xD;
send these letters to his friends in Europe."&#xD;
Our captain now came forward, and said, as firmly&#xD;
as he could, "1I wish Vanderdecken woultl put his&#xD;
letters on board of any other vessel rather than&#xD;
mine."&#xD;
" We have triell many a ship," replied the strang-&#xD;

Upon which, Tom Willis muttered, " It will be&#xD;

sometiines a sinking weight in your paper."&#xD;
The stranger tookt no notice of this, but asked&#xD;
where we were from. On being told that we were&#xD;
from Portsmouth, he said, as if with strong feeling,&#xD;
" Would that you had rather been from Amsterdam!&#xD;

&#xD;
THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
Oh that we saw it again !-we must see our friends&#xD;
again." .When he uttered these words, the men&#xD;
.who were in the boat below, wrung their hands, and&#xD;
cried, in a piercing tone, in Dutch, "Oh that we&#xD;
saw it aga in ! We hare been long here beating&#xD;
about: but we must see our friends again !"&#xD;
The chaplain asked the stranger, " How long have&#xD;
you been at sea?"&#xD;
He replied, " We have lost our count; for our al-&#xD;
muanack was blown overboard. Our ship, you see,&#xD;
is there still; so why should you ask how long we&#xD;
have been at sea? for Vanderdecken only wishes to&#xD;
write home and comfort his friends."&#xD;
To which the chaplain replied, "Your letters, I&#xD;
fear, would be of no use in Amsterdam, even if they&#xD;
were delivered, for the persons to whom they were&#xD;
addressed are probably no longer to be found there,&#xD;
except under very ancient green turf in the church-&#xD;
yardl."&#xD;
The un welcome stranger then wrung his hands&#xD;
and appeared to weep; and replied, " It is impossi-&#xD;
ble. We cannot believe you. We have been long&#xD;
driving about here, but country nor relations cannot&#xD;
be so easily forgotten. There is not a rain-drop in&#xD;
the air hut feels itself kindred to all the rest, and they&#xD;
fall back into the sea to meet with each other again.&#xD;
How then, can kindred blood be made to forget&#xD;
where it- came from? Even our bodies are part of&#xD;
the ground of Holland; and Vanderdecken says, if&#xD;
he were once come to Amsterdam, he would&#xD;
rather be changed into a stone post, well fixed into&#xD;
the ground, than leave it again, if that were to die&#xD;
elsewhere. But in the mean time, we only ask you&#xD;
to take these letters.&#xD;
The chaplain, looking at him with astonishment,&#xD;
said, " This is the insanity of natural affection,&#xD;
which rebels against all measures of time and dis-&#xD;
tance."&#xD;
The stranger continued, " Here is a letter .from&#xD;
our seC ond mate, to his dear and only remaining&#xD;

friend, his uncle, the merchant who lives in the se&#xD;
cond house on Stuncken Yacht Quay."&#xD;
He held forth the letter, but no one would ap4&#xD;
preach to take it.&#xD;
Tom Willis raised his voice, and said, "One of our&#xD;
men, here, says that he was in Amsterdam last sum~&#xD;
mer, and he knows for certain, that the street called&#xD;
Stuneken Yacht Quay was pulled down sixty years&#xD;
ago, and now there is only a large church at that&#xD;
place."&#xD;
The man from the Flying Dutchman said, "It is&#xD;
impossible; we cannot believe you. Here is another&#xD;
letter from myself, in which I have sent a bank note&#xD;
to my dear sister, to buy some gallant lace, to make&#xD;
her a high head-dress."&#xD;
Tom Willis hearing this said, "It is most likely&#xD;
that her head now lies under a tombstone, which&#xD;
will outlast all the changess of the fashion. But on&#xD;
~irhat house is your bank note?"&#xD;
The stranger replied, "On the house of Vander-&#xD;
brucker and Company."&#xD;
The man of whom Tom, Willis had spoken said,&#xD;
"I guess there will now be some discount upon it,&#xD;
for that banking-house was gone to destruction forty&#xD;
years ago; and Vanderbru6kei' was- afterwards mrs~&#xD;
sing.-But to remember these things is like raking&#xD;
up the bottom of an old canal."&#xD;
The stranger called out passionately, "It is rrn~&#xD;
possible--We cannot believe it! It is cruel to say&#xD;
such things to people in our condition. There is a&#xD;
letter from our captain himself, to his much-beloved&#xD;
and faithful wife, whom he left at a pleasant summer&#xD;
dwelling, on the border of the Haarlemer Mer. She&#xD;
promised to have the house beautifully painted and&#xD;
Q'ilded before he came back, and to get a new set of&#xD;
rooking-glasses for the principal chamber, that she&#xD;
might see as many images of Vanderdecken, as if&#xD;
she had six husbands at once."&#xD;
The man replied, "There has been tim~e enough&#xD;
for her to have had six husbands since then; but&#xD;
140'&#xD;
&#xD;
4b&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.&#xD;
were she alive still, there is no rear that' Vander&#xD;
decken would ever get home to disturb her."&#xD;
On hearing this, the stranger again shed tears,&#xD;
and said if~they would not take the letters he would&#xD;
leave them; and looking a round, he offered the par.&#xD;
cel to the captain, chaplain, and to the rest of' the&#xD;
crew successively: but each drew back as it was&#xD;
offered, and put his hands behind his back. He then&#xD;
laid the letters upon the deck, and placed upon them&#xD;
a piece of iron, which was lying near, to prevent&#xD;
them from being blown away. Having done this,&#xD;
he swung himself over the gang-way, and went into&#xD;
the boat~&#xD;
We heard the others speak to him, but the rise of&#xD;
a sudden squall prevented us from distinguishing his&#xD;
reply. The boat was seen to quit the ship's side,&#xD;
an(l in a few moments there was no more traces of&#xD;
her than if she had never been there. The sailors&#xD;
rubbed their eyes, as if doubting ~~hat they had wit.&#xD;
messed but the parcel still lay upon deck, and pros'-&#xD;
ed the reality of all that had passed.&#xD;
Duncan Saunderson, the Scotch mate, asked the&#xD;
captain if he should take them up and pu.t them in&#xD;
the letter-bag. Receiving no reply, he would have&#xD;
lifted them if it had not been for Tom 'Willis, who&#xD;
pulled him back, saying that nobody should touch&#xD;
them.&#xD;
In the mean time, the captain went down to the&#xD;
cabin, and the chaplain having followed him, found&#xD;
him at his bottle-case, pouring out a large drarri of&#xD;
brandy. The captain, although somewhat discon-&#xD;
certed, immediately offered the glass to him, saying,&#xD;
Here, Charters, is what is good in a cold rught."&#xD;
The chaplain declined drinking any thing, and the&#xD;
captain having swallowed the bumper, they both re~&#xD;
turned to the deck, where they found the seamen&#xD;
giving their opinions concerning what should be&#xD;
done with the letters. Tom Willis proposed to pick&#xD;
them up on a harpoon, and throw them overboard.&#xD;
Another speaker said,' I have always heard it as-&#xD;

serted, that it is neither safe to accept them votun&#xD;
tarily, nor, when they are left, to throw them out of&#xD;
the ship."&#xD;
"Let no one touch them," said the carpenter.&#xD;
" The way to do with these letters from -the Flying&#xD;
Dutchman is to case them upon deck, by nailing&#xD;
boards over them, so that if he sends back for them)&#xD;
they are still there to give him."&#xD;
The carpenter went to fetch his tools. During his&#xD;
absence the ship gave so violent a pitch, that the&#xD;
piece of iron slid off the letters, and they were whirl-&#xD;
ed overboard by the wind, like birds of evil omen&#xD;
whirring through the air. There was a cry of joy&#xD;
among the sailors, and they ascribed the favourable&#xD;
change which soon took place in the weather to our&#xD;
having got quit of Vanderdecken. We soon got un-&#xD;
der weigh again. The night watch being set, the&#xD;
rest of the crew retired to their births.&#xD;

FROM JONATHAN UNWELL, 01? NEW-YORK,&#xD;
TO MR. HERMAN KRAUFF.&#xD;
&#xD;
SIR,-Agreeable to my promise, I now relate to&#xD;
you all the particulars of the lost man and child,&#xD;
which I have been able to collect. It is entirely&#xD;
owing to the humane interest you seemed to take in&#xD;
the report, that I have pursued the iqiyt  h&#xD;
following result.                iqiyt      h&#xD;
You may remember that business called me to&#xD;
Boston in the summer of 1820. I sailed in the packet&#xD;
to Providence, and when I arrived there, I learned&#xD;
that every seat in the stage was engaged. I was&#xD;
thus obliged either to wait a few hours, or accept a&#xD;
scat with the driver, who civilly offered me that ac-&#xD;
commodation. Accordingly I took my seat by his&#xD;
side, and soon found him intelligent and comimuni-&#xD;
cative. When we had travelled about ten miles,&#xD;
the horses suddenly threw their ears on their necks,&#xD;
as' flat as a hare's. Said the driver, " have you a&#xD;
surtout with -you?" " No," said I, " why do you&#xD;
ask ?" "You will want one soon," said he. "Do&#xD;
you observe the ears of all the horses?" " Yes,"&#xD;
and was just about to ask the reason. " They see&#xD;
the storm breeder, and we shall see him soon." At&#xD;
this moment there was not a- cloud visible in the fir-&#xD;
mament. Soon after a small speck appeared in the&#xD;
road. "There," said my companion, "comes the&#xD;
storm breeder; he always leaves a Scotch mist be&#xD;

hind him. By many a wet jacket I do remember bib-i.&#xD;
I suppose the poor fellow suffers much himself, much&#xD;
more than is known to the world." Presently a man&#xD;
with a child beside him, with a large black horse,&#xD;
and a weather-beaten chair, once built for a chaise&#xD;
body, passed in great haste, apparently at the rate&#xD;
of twelve miles an hour. He seemed to grasp the&#xD;
reins of his horse with firmness, and appeared to an-&#xD;
ticipate his speed. He seemed dejected, and looked&#xD;
anxiously at the passengers, particularly at the stage&#xD;
driver and myself. In a moment after he passed us,&#xD;
the horses' ears were up, and bent themselves for-&#xD;
ward so that they nearly met. "Who is that man,'&#xD;
said I, "he seems in great trouble." " Nobody&#xD;
knows who he is, but his person and the child ai&#xD;
familiar to me. I have met him more than a hut&#xD;
dred times, and-have been so often asked the way tt&#xD;
Boston by that man, even when he was travelling&#xD;
lireetly from that town, that of late I have refused&#xD;
~ny communication with him; and that is the rea-&#xD;
son he gave me sucha fixed look." "But (loes he&#xD;
never stop any where?" "I have never known him&#xD;
to stop any where, longer than to inquire the way to&#xD;
Boston; and let him be where he may, he will tell&#xD;
you he cannot stay a moment, for he must reach&#xD;
Boston that night."&#xD;
WTe were now ascending a high hill in Walpole;&#xD;
and as we had a fair view of the heavens, I was&#xD;
rather disposed to jeer the driver for thinking of his&#xD;
surtout, as not a cloud as big as a marble could be&#xD;
discerned. "Do you look," said he, "in the diree.&#xD;
ion whence the man came, that is the place to look;&#xD;
the storm never meets him, it follows him." We&#xD;
presently approached another hill, and when at the&#xD;
height, the driver pointed out in an eastern diree..&#xD;
tion a little black speck about as big as a hat.&#xD;
"There said he is the seed storm; we may possibly&#xD;
reach Polley's before it reaches us, but the wanders&#xD;
e.r and his cli ild will go to Providence through rain,&#xD;
thunder, and lightning." And now the horses, as&#xD;
146&#xD;
&#xD;
I -&#xD;
',6&#xD;
&#xD;
though taught by instinct, hastened with increased&#xD;
speed. The~ little black cloud came on rolling over&#xD;
the turnpike, and doubled and trebled itself in all&#xD;
directions. The appearance of this cloud attracted&#xD;
the notice of all the passengers; for after bjt had&#xD;
spread itself to a great bulk, it suddenly became&#xD;
more limited in circumference, grew more compact,&#xD;
(lark, and consolidated. And now the successive&#xD;
flashes of' chain lightning caused the whole cloud to&#xD;
appear like a sort of irregular net work, and dis-&#xD;
played a thousand fantastic images. The driver be-&#xD;
spoke my attention to a remarkable configuration in&#xD;
the cloud: he said every flash of lightning near its&#xD;
centre discovered to him distinctly the form of a&#xD;
man sitting in an open carriage drawn by a black&#xD;
horse. But in truth, I saw no such thing. The&#xD;
man's fancy was doubtless at fault. It is a very&#xD;
common thing for the imagination to paint 'for the&#xD;
senses, both in the visil5le and invisible world.&#xD;
In the mean time the distant thunder gave notice&#xD;
of a shower at hand; and just as we reached Polley's&#xD;
tavern the rain poured down in torrents. It was&#xD;
soon over, the cloud passing in the direction of the&#xD;
turnpike towards Providence. In a few moments&#xD;
after a respectable looking man in a chaise stopped&#xD;
at the door. The man and child in the chair having&#xD;
excited some little sympathy among the passengers,&#xD;
the gentleman was asked if he had observed them.&#xD;
He said he had met them, that the man seemed be-&#xD;
wildered, and inquired~the way to Boston; that he&#xD;
was driving at great speed, as though he expected&#xD;
to outstrip the tempest; th~it the moment he had&#xD;
I)assed him, a thunder clap broke distinctly over the&#xD;
man's head, and seemed to envelope both man and&#xD;
child, horse and carriage. "I stopped," said the&#xD;
gentleman, "supposing the lightning had struck&#xD;
him, but the horse only seemed to loam up and in-&#xD;
crease his speed, and as well as I could judge he&#xD;
travelled just as fast as the thunder cloud." While&#xD;
this man was speaking, a pedlar, with a cart of tip&#xD;
147&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7980-00000075"/>&#xD;
MARVELLOUS REPOSITORY,.&#xD;
merchandize came up, all dripping; and, on Th&#xD;
questioned, he said he bad met that man and car-&#xD;
riage, within a fortnight, in four different states.;&#xD;
that at each time he had inquired the way to Boston',&#xD;
and that a thunder shower, like the present bad&#xD;
each time deluged his wagon and his wares, setting&#xD;
his tin pots, 8Ec. afloat, so that he had determined to&#xD;
get marine insurance done fbr the future. But that&#xD;
which excited his surprise most, was the strange&#xD;
conduct of his horse, for that long before he could&#xD;
distinguish the man in the chair, his own horse stood&#xD;
still in the road, and flung back his ears. " In&#xD;
short," said the pedlar, " I wish never to see that&#xD;
man and horse again; they do not look to me as&#xD;
though they belonged to this world." -&#xD;
This was all I could learn at that time; and the&#xD;
occurrence soon after, would have become with me,&#xD;
" like one of those things which had never happen-'&#xD;
ed," had I not, as I stood recently on the doo-step&#xD;
of Bennett's hotel in Hartford, heard a man say,&#xD;
" there goes Peter Rugg and his child! he looks wet&#xD;
and weary, and farther from Boston than ever." I&#xD;
was satisfied it was the same man I had seen more&#xD;
than three years before; for whoever has once seen&#xD;
Peter Rugg can never after be deceived as to his&#xD;
identity. "Peter -Rugg !" said I, " and who is Pe-&#xD;
ter Rugg ?" " That," said the stranger, " is more&#xD;
than any one can tell exactly. He is a famous tra-&#xD;
veller, held in light esteem by all innholders, for he&#xD;
never stops to eat, drink, or sleep. I wonder why&#xD;
the government do not employ him to carry the mail."&#xD;
" Aye," said a bystander, " that is a thought bright&#xD;
only on one side; how long would it take in that&#xD;
case to send a letter to Boston, for Peter has already,&#xD;
to my knowledge, been more than twenty years tra-.&#xD;
velling to that place." " But,"- said I, " does the&#xD;
man never stop any where, does he never converse&#xD;
with any one? I saw the same man more than three&#xD;
years since, near Providence, and I heard a strange .&#xD;
story about him, Pray sir, give me some account&#xD;
148&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
PETER RUTGG&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
of this man." " Sir," said the stranger, "those&#xD;
who know the most respecting that man, say the&#xD;
least. .I have heard it, asserted that heaven some-&#xD;
times sets a mark on a man, either for judgment or a&#xD;
-trial. Under which Peter Rugg now labours, I can&#xD;
not say; therefore I am rather inclined to pit than&#xD;
to judge." ."You speak like a humane man,"' said I,&#xD;
"and if you have known him so long, I pray you&#xD;
wil give me some account of him. Has his appear&#xD;
ance much altered in that time?" " Why, yes&#xD;
He looks as though he never ate, drank, or slept; and&#xD;
his child looks older than himself, and he looks like&#xD;
time broke off from eternity, and anxious to gain a&#xD;
resting place." "And how does his horse look?"&#xD;
said I. " As for his horse, he looks fatter and gayer,&#xD;
and shows more animation and courage, than he did&#xD;
twenty years ago. The last time Rugg spoke to me&#xD;
he inquired how far it was to Boston. I told him&#xD;
just one hundred miles."  "  h, said he, " how&#xD;
can you deceive me so? it is cruel to mislead a tra-&#xD;
veller. I have lost, my way; pray direct me the&#xD;
nearest way to Boston." I repeated it was one hun-&#xD;
dred miles. "How can you say so?" said he, "I&#xD;
was told last evening it was but fifty, and I have&#xD;
travelled all night." " But,'' said I, "you are now&#xD;
travelling from Boston. You must turn ,back."&#xD;
" Alas," said he, " it is all turn back ! Boston shifts&#xD;
with the wind, and plays all around the compass.&#xD;
One man tells me it is to the East, another to the&#xD;
West; and the guide posts too, they all point the&#xD;
wrong way." " But will you not stop and rest,"&#xD;
said I. " You seem wet and weary." " Yes," said&#xD;
he, "it has been foul weather since 1 left home."&#xD;
"Stop then, and refresh yourself." " I must not&#xD;
stop, I must reach home to-night if possible: though&#xD;
I think you must be mistaken in the distance to Bos-&#xD;
ton.'' He then gave the reins to his horse, which&#xD;
he restrained with difficulty, and disappeared in a&#xD;
moment. A few days afterwards I met the man a&#xD;
little this side of Claremont, winding around the&#xD;

hills in Unity, at the rate, I believe, of twelve miles&#xD;
an hour."&#xD;
"Is Peter Rugg his real name,. or has he accident-&#xD;
ally gained that name ?" " I know not, but presume&#xD;
he will not deny his name, you can ask him, for-see,&#xD;
he has turned his horse, and, is passing this way."&#xD;
In a moment, a dark coldoured, high spirited horse&#xD;
approached, and would have passed without stop-&#xD;
ping, but I had resolved to speak to Peter Rugg, or&#xD;
whoever the man might be. Accordingly I stepped&#xD;
into the street, and as the horse approached, I made&#xD;
a feint of stopping him. The man immediately&#xD;
reined in his- horse. " Sir," said I, "may I be so&#xD;
bold as to inquire if you are not Mr. Rugg? for I&#xD;
think I have seen you before." " My name is Peter&#xD;
Rugg," said he, "I have unfortunitely lost my way;&#xD;
I am wet and weary, and will take it kindly of you&#xD;
to direct me to Boston." "You live in Boston, do&#xD;
you, and in what street?" "In Middle-street."&#xD;
" When did you leave Boston ?" " I cannot tell&#xD;
precisely; it seems a considerable time." " But&#xD;
howv did you and your child become so wet ? It has&#xD;
not rained here to-day." f' It has just rained a&#xD;
heavy shower up the river. But I shall not reach&#xD;
Boston to-night if I tarry. Would you advise me to&#xD;
take the old road, or the turnpike ?" '' Why, the&#xD;
old road is one hundred and seventeen miles, and&#xD;
the turnpike is ninety-seven.". " How can you say&#xD;
so? you impose on me; it is wrong to trifle with a&#xD;
traveller; you know it is but forty miles from New-&#xD;
buryport to Boston." " But this is not Newbury-&#xD;
port; this is Hartford." "Do not deceive me sir-.&#xD;
Is not this town Newburyport, and the river that I i&#xD;
have been following, the Merrimac?" "No, Sir,&#xD;
this is Hartford, and the river, the Connecticut."&#xD;
He wrung his hands and looked incredulous.&#xD;
" Have the rivers, too, changed their courses, as the&#xD;
cities have changed places? But see, the clouds are&#xD;
gathering in the south, and we shall have a rainy&#xD;
night. Ah, that fatal oath!l" He would tarry no&#xD;
150&#xD;
&#xD;
longer, his impatient horse leaped off, his bind&#xD;
flanks rising like wings, he seemedlto devour all be-&#xD;
fore him, and to scorn all behind.&#xD;
1 had now, as I thought, discovered a clue to the&#xD;
history of Peter Rugg, and I determined, the next&#xD;
time my business called me to Boston, to make a fur..&#xD;
ther inquiry. Soon after, I was enabled to collect&#xD;
the following particulars from Mrs. Croft, an aged&#xD;
lady in Middle-street, who has resided in Boston&#xD;
during the last twenty years. Her narration is this:&#xD;
.-u The last summer a person, just at twilight, stop-&#xD;
ped at the door of the late Mrs. Rugg. Mrs. Croft,&#xD;
on coming to the door, perceived a stranger, with a&#xD;
child by his side, in an old weather-beaten carriage,&#xD;
with a black- horse. The stranger asked for Mrs.&#xD;
Rugg, and was informed that Mrs. Rugg liad died&#xD;
in a good old age, more than twenty years before&#xD;
that time. The stranger replied, ''How cahi you&#xD;
deceive me so? do ask Mrs. Rugg to step to the&#xD;
door.' ' Sir, I assure you Mrs. Rugg has not lived&#xD;
here these nineteen years; no one lives here but my-&#xD;
self, and myname is Betsey Croft.' The stranger&#xD;
paused, and looked up and down the street, and said,&#xD;
' though the painting is rather faded, this looks like&#xD;
my house ' 'Yes,' said the child, ' that is the&#xD;
stone before the door, that I used to sit on to eat my&#xD;
bread and milk.' 'But,' said the stranger, 'it&#xD;
seems to be on the wrong side of the street. Indeed,&#xD;
every thing here seems to be misplaced.&#xD;
The streets are all changed, the people are all&#xD;
changed, the town seems changed, and what is&#xD;
strangest of all, Catherine Rugg has deserted her&#xD;
husband and child. Pray,' continued the stranger,&#xD;
'has John Foy come home from sea? he went a&#xD;
long voyage, he is my kinsman. If I could see him,&#xD;
he could give me some account of Mrs. Rugg.'&#xD;
' Sir,' said Mrs. Croft,'' I never heard of John Foy.&#xD;
Where did he live?' ' Just above here, in Orange&#xD;
.Tree Lane.' 'There is no such place in this&#xD;
neighbourhood.' 'What do you tell me! Are the&#xD;

streets gone? Orange Tree Lane is at the head of&#xD;
Hanover-street, near Pemberton's hill.' 'There&#xD;
is no such *Lane now.' 'Madam! you cannot ~e&#xD;
serious. Bat you douktless know my brother Wil-&#xD;
liam Rugg. He~ lives in Royal Exchange Lane,&#xD;
near King-street.' 'I know of no such lane; and I&#xD;
am sure there is no such street as King-street in this&#xD;
town.' 'No such street as King-street? Why&#xD;
woman! you mock me. You may as well teif me&#xD;
there is no King George. However, madam, you&#xD;
see I am wet and weary, I must find a resting place.&#xD;
I will go to Hart's tavern, near the market.'&#xD;
'XVhich market, sir? for you seem perp1exe~.1; we&#xD;
have several markets.' 'You know there is but&#xD;
one market near the rrown dock.' '0, the the old&#xD;
market, but no such person has kept there these&#xD;
twenty years.' Here the stranger seemed discon-&#xD;
certed,. and uttered to himself quite audibly,&#xD;
'Strange mistake, how much this looks like the&#xD;
town of Boston! It certainly has a great resem-&#xD;
blance to it; but I perceive my mistakee nbw. Some&#xD;
other Mrs. Rugg, some other Middle-street.' Then&#xD;
said he, 'madam, can you direct me to Boston?'&#xD;
'Why this is Boston, the city of Boston, I know of no&#xD;
other Boston.' 'City of Boston it may be'; but it is&#xD;
not the B~ston where I live. I recollect now, I&#xD;
came over a bridge instead of a ferry. Pray What&#xD;
bridge is that, I just came over?' 'It is Charles&#xD;
River Bridge.' 'I perceive my mistake, there is a&#xD;
ferry between Boston and Charlestown, there is no&#xD;
bridge. Ah, I perceive my mistake, if I was in Bos-&#xD;
ton my horse would carry me directly to my own door.&#xD;
But my horse shows, by his impatience that he is in a&#xD;
strange place. Absurd, that I should have mistaken&#xD;
this I)lace for the old town of Boston! it is a much&#xD;
finer city than the town of Boston. It has been&#xD;
built long since Boston. I fawcy it must lie at a dis-&#xD;
tanc~ from this city, as the good woman seems igno-&#xD;
rant of it.' At these words his horse began to chafe,&#xD;
and strike the pavement with his fore feet; the&#xD;

PETER RUGG.&#xD;
stranger seemed a little bewildered, and sai(l, 'ho&#xD;
home to-night,' and giving the reins to his horse,&#xD;
passed up the street, and I saw no more of him."&#xD;
It was evident that the generation to which Peter&#xD;
Ilugg belonged had passed ~iway.&#xD;
This was all the account of Peter Rugg I could&#xD;
obtain from Mrs. Croft; but she directed me to an&#xD;
elderly man, Mr. James Felt, who lived near her,&#xD;
and who had kept a record of the principal occur-&#xD;
rences for the last fifty years. At my request, she&#xD;
sent for him; and, after I had related to him the ob-&#xD;
ject of my inquiry, Mr. Felt told me he had known&#xD;
Rugg in his youth; that his disappearance had&#xD;
caused some surprise; hut as it sometimes happens&#xD;
that men run away, sometimes to be rid of others,&#xD;
and sometimes to be rid of themselves; and Rugg&#xD;
took his child with him, and his own horse and chair;&#xD;
and as it did not appear that any creditors made a&#xD;
stir, the occurrence soon mingled itself in the stream&#xD;
of oblivion; and jI~ugg and his child, horse an(l chair,&#xD;
were soon forgotten. "It is true," said Mr. Felt,&#xD;
"sundry stories grew out of Rugg's affair, whether&#xD;
true or false Icannot tell; but stranger things have&#xD;
happened in my day, without even a newspaper no-&#xD;
tice." "Sir," said I, " Peter Rugg is now living.&#xD;
I have lately seen Peter Rugg and his child, horse&#xD;
and chair; therefore, I pray you to relate to me all&#xD;
you know or ever heard of him." "Why, my&#xD;
friend," said James Felt, "that Peter Rugg is now&#xD;
a living man I will not deny; but that you have seen&#xD;
Peter Rugg an(l his child, is impossible, if you mean&#xD;
a small child, for Jenny Rugg, if living, must be at&#xD;
least-let me see-Boston massacre, 1770-Jenny&#xD;
Rugg was about ten years old. Why, sir, Jenny&#xD;
Rugg, if living, must be more than sixty years of age.&#xD;
rI~hat Peter Rugg is living is highly probable, as he&#xD;
was only ten years older than myself; and I was&#xD;
only eighty last March; and I am as likely to live&#xD;
twenty years longer as any man." Here l.perceiv-&#xD;

&#xD;
of gaining any intelligence from him, on wnich I&#xD;
could depend.&#xD;
I took my leave of Mrs. Croft, and proceeded to&#xD;
my lodgings at the Marlborough Hotel.&#xD;
If Peter Rugg, thought I, has been travelling&#xD;
since the Boston massacre, there is no reason why&#xD;
he should not travel to the end of time. If the pre-&#xD;
sent generation know little of him, the next will&#xD;
know less, and Peter and his child will have no hold&#xD;
on this world.&#xD;
In the course of the evening, I related my adven-&#xD;
ture in Middle-street. "Ha!" said one of the corn-&#xD;
p any, smiling, "do you really think you have seen&#xD;
Peter Rugg? I have heard my grandfather speak of&#xD;
him, as though he seriously believed his own story."&#xD;
"Sir," said I, "pray let us compare your grand-&#xD;
father's story of Mr. Rugg, with my own." "Peter&#xD;
Rugg, sir, if my grandfather was worthy of credit,&#xD;
once lived in Middle-street, in this city. He was a&#xD;
man in comfortable circumstances, had a wife and&#xD;
one daughter, and Was generally esteemed for his so-&#xD;
ber life and manners. But unhappily his temper, at&#xD;
times was altogether ungovernable, and then his&#xD;
language was terrible. In these fits of passion, if a&#xD;
door stood in his way, he would never do less than&#xD;
kick a panel through. He would sometimes throw&#xD;
his heels over his head, and come down on his feel,&#xD;
uttering oaths in a circle; and thus in a rage, he&#xD;
was the first who performed a somerset, and did&#xD;
- what others have since learned to do for merriment&#xD;
and money. Once, Rugg was seen to bite a ten-&#xD;
penny, nail in halves. In those days, every body,&#xD;
both men and boys, wore wigs; and Peter, at these&#xD;
moments of violent passion, ould become so pro-&#xD;
fane that his wig would rise u from his head. Some&#xD;
said it was on account of is terrible language.&#xD;
Others accounted for it in a mo e philosophical way,&#xD;
and said it was caused by the expan&amp;amp;on of his scalp;&#xD;
as violent passion, we know, will swell the veins and&#xD;
expand the head. While these fits were on him,&#xD;
154&#xD;
&#xD;
Rugg had no respect for heaven or earth. Except&#xD;
this infirmity, all agreed that Rugg was a good sort&#xD;
of a man; for when his fits were over, nobody was so&#xD;
ready to commend a placid temper as Peter.&#xD;
"It was late in autumn, one morning, that Rugg&#xD;
in his own chair, with a fine large bay horse, took&#xD;
his daughter and proceeded to Concord. On his re-&#xD;
turn, a violent storm overtook him. At dark, he&#xD;
stopped in Menotomy, (now West-Cambridge,) at&#xD;
the door of a Mr. Cutter, a friend of his, who urged&#xD;
him to tarry the night. On Rugg's declining to stop&#xD;
Mr. Cutter urged him vehemently. 'Why, Mr.&#xD;
Rugg,' said Cutter, 'the storm is overwhelmii~ig you;&#xD;
the night is exceeding dark; your little daughter&#xD;
will perish; you are in an open chair, and~the tem-&#xD;
pest is increasing.' 'Let the storm increase,' said&#xD;
Rugg, with a fearful oath, 'I will see home to-night,&#xD;
in spite of the last tempest! or may I never see home.'&#xD;
At these words, he gave his whip to his high spirited&#xD;
horse, and disappeared in a moment. But Peter&#xD;
Rugg did not reach home that night, nor the next;&#xD;
nor, when he became a missing man, could he ever&#xD;
he traced beyond Mr. Cutter's ih Menotomy. For&#xD;
a long time after, on every dark and stormy night,&#xD;
the wife of Peter Rugg would fancy she heard th~&#xD;
crack of a whip, and the fleet tread of a horse, and&#xD;
the rattling of carriage, passing her door. The&#xD;
neighbours too, heard the same noises, and some&#xD;
said they knew it was Rugg's horse; the tread on&#xD;
the pavement was perfectly familiar to them. This&#xD;
occurred so repeatedly, that at length the neigh-&#xD;
l~our~ watched with lanterns, and saw the real Peter&#xD;
Rugg, with his own horse and chair, and child sit-&#xD;
ting beside him, pass directly before his own door,&#xD;
his head turned towards his house, and himself mak-&#xD;
ing every effort to stop his horse, but in vain. The&#xD;
next day, the friends of Mrs. Rugg exerted them-&#xD;
selves to fin.d her husband and child. They inquir-&#xD;
ed at every public house and stable in town; but it&#xD;
did not appear that Rugg made any stay in Bostoi~&#xD;

&#xD;
No one, after Rugg had passed his own door, could&#xD;
give any account of him; though it was asserted by&#xD;
some that the clatter of Rugg's horse and carriage&#xD;
over the pavements shook the houses on both sides of&#xD;
the streets. And this is credible, if indeed Rugg s&#xD;
horse and carriage did pass on that night. For at this&#xD;
day, in manyof the streets, a loaded truck or team in&#xD;
passing will shake the houses like an earthquake.&#xD;
However, Rugg's neighbours never afterwards&#xD;
watched; some of them treated it all as a delusion,&#xD;
and thought no more of it. Others, of a different&#xD;
opinion, shook their heads and said nothing. Thus&#xD;
Rugg, and his child, horse and chair, were soon for-&#xD;
gotten; and probably many in the neighbourhood&#xD;
never heard a word on the subject.&#xD;
"Ther~e was indeed a rumour, that Rugg after-&#xD;
wards was seen in Connecticut, between Suflield&#xD;
and Hartford, passing through the country like a&#xD;
streak of chalk. This gave occasion to Rugg's&#xD;
friends to make further inquiry. But the more they&#xD;
in~4uired, ihe more they were baffled. If they heard&#xD;
of Rugg one* day in Con necticut,-the next, they&#xD;
heard of him winding round the hills in New-Hamp-&#xD;
shire; and soon after, a man in a chair, with a small&#xD;
child, exactly answering the description of Peter&#xD;
Rugg, would be seen in Rhode-Island, inquiring the&#xD;
way to Boston.&#xD;
"But that which chiefly gave a colour of mystery&#xD;
to the story of Peter Rugg, was the affair at Charles-&#xD;
town bridge. The toll-gatherer asserted that some-&#xD;
times, on the darkest, and most stormy nights, when&#xD;
no object could be discerned, about the time Rugg&#xD;
was missing, a horse and wheel carriage, with a&#xD;
noise equal to a troop, would at midnight, in utter&#xD;
contempt of the rates of toll, pass over the bridge.&#xD;
This occurred so frequently, that the toll-gatherer&#xD;
resolved to attempt a discovery. Soon after, at the&#xD;
usual time, apparently the same horse and carriage&#xD;
approached the bridge from Charlestown square.&#xD;
The toll-gatherer, prepared, took his stand as near&#xD;

&#xD;
the middle of the bridge as he dared, with a large&#xD;
three-legged stool in his hand. As the appearance&#xD;
passed, he threw the stool at the horse, but heard&#xD;
nothing, except the noise of the stool skipping across&#xD;
the bridge. The toll-gatherer, on the next day, as-&#xD;
serted that the stool ivent directly through the body&#xD;
of the horse' and he persisted in that belief ever&#xD;
after. Whether Rugg, or whoever the person was,&#xD;
ever passed the bridge again, the toll-gatherer&#xD;
would never tell-~and when questioned seemed&#xD;
anxious to waive the subject. And thus, Peter&#xD;
Rugg and his child, horse and carriage, remain a&#xD;
mystery to this day."&#xD;
This, sir, is all that I could learn of Peter Rugg in&#xD;
Boston.&#xD;
FURTHER ACCOUNT OF PETER RUGG.&#xD;
&#xD;
BY JONATHAN DUINWELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
IN the autumn of 1825, I attended the races at&#xD;
Richmond in Virginia; as two new horses of great&#xD;
promise were run, the race-ground was never better&#xD;
attended, nor wa~ expectation ever more deeply ex-&#xD;
cited. The partisans of Dart and Lightning, the&#xD;
two race-horses were equally anxious, and equally&#xD;
dubious of the result. To an indifferent spectator&#xD;
it was impossible to perceive any difference~ They&#xD;
were equally beautiful to behold, alike in colour and&#xD;
height, and as they stood side by side, they measur-&#xD;
ed from heel to fore 'feet within half an inch ~of each&#xD;
other. The eyes of each were full, prominent and&#xD;
resolute, and when at times they regarded each&#xD;
other, they assumed a lofty demeanour, seemed to&#xD;
shorten their necks, project their eyes; and rest&#xD;
their bodies equally op their four hoofs. They cer-&#xD;
tainly discovered signs of intelligence, and displayed&#xD;

&#xD;
a courtesy to each other, unusual even with states.&#xD;
men. It was now nearly 12 o'clock, the hour of ex.-&#xD;
peCctationl, doubt and anxiety. The riders mounted&#xD;
their horses; and so trim, light, and airy, they sat on&#xD;
the animals, they seemed a part of them. The spec-&#xD;
tators, many deep, in a solid column, had taken&#xD;
their places; and as many thousand breathing sta-&#xD;
tues were there as spectators. All eyes were turned&#xD;
to Dart and Lightniing, and their two fairy riders.&#xD;
There was nothing to disturb this calm, except a&#xD;
busy woodpecker on a neighbouring tree. The sig-&#xD;
nal was given, and Dart and Lightning answered&#xD;
the signal with ready intelligence. At first they&#xD;
proceed on a slow trot, then they quicken to a can-&#xD;
ter, and then a gallop., Presently they sweep the&#xD;
plain; both horses lay themselves,. flat on the ground&#xD;
their riders bending fom'ward, and resting their chins&#xD;
between their horses' ears. Had not the ground&#xD;
been perfectly level, had there been any undulation,&#xD;
the least rise and fall, the spectator, every moment,&#xD;
for a moment, would have lost sight of both horses&#xD;
and riders. While these horses, side by side, thus&#xD;
appeared, flying without wings, flat as a hare, and&#xD;
neither gained on the other, all eyes were diverted&#xD;
to a new spectacle. Directly in the rear of Dart&#xD;
and Lightning, a'majestic black horse,'of unusual-&#xD;
size, drawing an old weather-beaten chair, strode&#xD;
over the plain; ahd,'although he appeared to make&#xD;
no effort, for he maintained a steady trot, before&#xD;
Dart and Lightning approached the goal, the black&#xD;
horse and chair had overtaken the racers, who, on&#xD;
perceiving this new competitor pass them, threw&#xD;
back their ears and suddenly stopped in their course.&#xD;
Thus neither Dart nor Lightning carried away the&#xD;
purse. The spectators, now, were exceedingly cu-&#xD;
nious to learn whence came the black horse and&#xD;
chair. With many it was the opinion that nobody&#xD;
was in the vehicle. Indeed this began to be the pre-&#xD;
valent opinion, for those at a short distance, so fleet&#xD;
was the black horse, could not easily discern who.&#xD;
15~8&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
m&#xD;
&#xD;
mammm&#xD;
&#xD;
if any body was in the carriage. But both the&#xD;
riders, whom the black hoi-se passed very nearly,&#xD;
agreed in this particular, that a sad looking man,&#xD;
with a little girl, was in the chair. -When they&#xD;
stated this, I was satisfied it was Peter Rugg. But&#xD;
what caused no little surprise, John Spring, one of&#xD;
the riders, he who rode Lightning, asserted that no&#xD;
earthly horse, without breaking his trot, could in a&#xD;
carriage outstrip his race horse: and he persisted&#xD;
with some passion, that it was not a horse, he&#xD;
was sure .it was not a horse, but a large black&#xD;
ox. "What a great black ox can do," said John,&#xD;
'"I cannot pretend to say; but no race horse, not&#xD;
even Flying Childers, could out-trot Lightning in&#xD;
a fair race." This opinion of John Spring excit-&#xD;
ed no little merriment, for it was clearly obvious to&#xD;
every one, that it was a powerful black horse that in-&#xD;
terrupted the race; but John Spring, jealous of&#xD;
Lightning's reputation as a horse, would rather have&#xD;
it thought that any other beast, even an ox, had been&#xD;
the victor. However, the horse-laugh at John&#xD;
Spring's expense was soon suppressed; for as soon as&#xD;
Dart and Lightning began to breath more freely, it&#xD;
was observed that both of them walked deliberately&#xD;
to the tract of the race ground, and putting their&#xD;
heads to the earth, they suddenly raised them again&#xD;
and began to snort. They repeated this, till John&#xD;
Spring said, "these horses have discovered some-&#xD;
thing strange; they suspect foul play; let me go and&#xD;
talk with Lightning." And he went up to Light.-&#xD;
nling and took hold of his mane; and Lightning put&#xD;
his nose toward the ground, and smelt of the earth&#xD;
without touching it, and then reared his head very&#xD;
high, and snorted so loudiy, that the sound echoed&#xD;
from the' next hill. Dart did the same. - John&#xD;
Spring stooped down to examine' the spot where&#xD;
Lightning smelt. In a moment he raised himself&#xD;
up, and the countenance of the man was changed;&#xD;
his strength failed him, and he sidled against -Light-&#xD;
ning. At length John Spring recovered from his&#xD;

&#xD;
stupor, and exclaimed, "it was an ox! 1 told you it&#xD;
was an ox, no real horse ever yet beat Lightning."&#xD;
And now, on a close inspection of the black horse's&#xD;
tracks in the path, it was evident to every one, that&#xD;
the fore feet of the black horse were cloven. Not-&#xD;
withstanding these appearances, to me it was evi-&#xD;
dent that the strange horse, was in reality a horse.&#xD;
Yet when the people left the race ground, I presume&#xD;
one half of all those presentwould have testified&#xD;
that a large black ox had distanced two of th&amp;amp;fieet-&#xD;
est courses that ever trod the Virginia turf. So un-&#xD;
certain are all things called historical facts.&#xD;
While I was proceeding to my lodgings, ponder-~&#xD;
ing on the events of the day, a stranger rode up lo&#xD;
me, and accosted me thus, "I think your name is&#xD;
Dunwell, sir?" "EYes sir," I replied. "Did I not&#xD;
see you a year or two since, in BosUon, at the Marl-&#xD;
borough Hotel?" "Very likely, sir, for I was&#xD;
there." "And you heard a story about one Peter&#xD;
Rugg?" "I recollect it all," said I. " The ac-&#xD;
count you heard in Boston must be true, for here he&#xD;
was to-day. The man has found his way to Vir..&#xD;
ginia, and for aught that appears, has been to Cape&#xD;
Horn. I have seen him before to-day, but never saw&#xD;
him travel with such fearful velocity. Pray, sir,&#xD;
where d6es Peter Rugg spend his winters? for I&#xD;
have seen 'him only in summer, and always in foul&#xD;
weather, except at this time." I replied, ~ No one&#xD;
knows where Peter Rugg spends his winters; where&#xD;
or when he eats, drinks, sleeps, or lodges. He seems&#xD;
to have an indistinct idea of day and night, time and&#xD;
space, storm and sunshine. His only object is Bos-&#xD;
ton. It appears to me that Rugg's horse has some&#xD;
control of the chair: arid that Rugg himself is, in&#xD;
some sort, under the control of his horse." I then&#xD;
inquire(l of the stranger, where he first saw the nian&#xD;
and horse. "Why, sir," said he, "in the summer&#xD;
of 1824, 1 travelled to the North for my health, and&#xD;
soon after I saw you at the Marlborough Hotel, I x'e~&#xD;
turned homeward to Virginia, and, if my memory is&#xD;

&#xD;
PETER RUGG.&#xD;
&#xD;
correct, I saw this man and horse in every State be..&#xD;
tween here and Massachusetts. Sometimes he would&#xD;
meet me, but oftener overtake me. He never spoke&#xD;
hut once, and that once was in Delaware. On his&#xD;
approach he checked his horse with some difficulty.&#xD;
A more leautifA horse I never saw; his hide was as&#xD;
fair, and rotund, and glossy as the skin of a Congo&#xD;
beauty. When Rngg's horse approached mine, he&#xD;
reined in his neck, bent his ears forward until they&#xD;
met, and looked my horse' full in the face. My&#xD;
horse immediately withered into half a horse; his&#xD;
hide curled up like a piece of burnt leather, spell&#xD;
bound, he was fixed to the earth as though a nail&#xD;
had been drove through each hoof. "Sir," said&#xD;
Rugg, "perhaps you are travelling to Bosto nand&#xD;
if so, I should be happy to accompany you, for I have&#xD;
lost my way, and I must reach home to-night. See&#xD;
how sleepy this little girl looks; poor thing, she is a&#xD;
picture of patience." "Sir," said I, "it is impossi-&#xD;
ble for you to reach home to-night, for you are in&#xD;
Concord in the county of Sussex, in the state of Del-&#xD;
aware." "What do you mean," said he, "by state&#xD;
of Delaware? If I was in Concord, that is only&#xD;
twenty miles from Boston, and my horse Lightfoot&#xD;
could carry me to Charlestown Ferry in less than&#xD;
two hours. You mistake, sir; you are a stranger&#xD;
here; this town is nothing like Concord. I am well&#xD;
acquainted with Concord. I went to Concord when&#xD;
I left Boston." "But," said I, "you are in Con-&#xD;
cord, in the state of Delaware." "What do you&#xD;
n~ean by state I" said Rugg. "Why one of the&#xD;
United States." "States," said he, in a low voice,&#xD;
"the man is a wag, and would persuade me I. am in&#xD;
Holland." Then raising his voice, he said, "you&#xD;
seem, sir, to be a gentleman, and I entreat you to&#xD;
mislead me not; tell me quickly, for pity's sake, the&#xD;
right road to BostoR, for you see my horse will swal-&#xD;
low his bitts for he has eaten nothing since I left&#xD;
Concord." "' Sir," said I, "this town is Concord,&#xD;
Concord in Delaware, not ~Concord in Massachu-&#xD;

is&#xD;
&#xD;
setts; and you are now five hundred miles from Bbs..&#xD;
ton." Rugg looked at me for a moment, more in&#xD;
sorrow than resentment, and then repeated, "five&#xD;
hundred miles! unhappy man, who would have&#xD;
thought he had been deranged; but nothing is so de-&#xD;
ceitful as appearances, in this world. Fivehundred&#xD;
miles! this beats. Connecticut River." What he&#xD;
meant by Connecticut River, I know not; his horse&#xD;
broke away, and Rugg disappeared in a moment."&#xD;
I explained to the stranger the meaning of Rugg's&#xD;
expression, "Connecticut River," and the incident&#xD;
respecting him, that occurred at Hartford, as I stood&#xD;
on the door stone of Mr. Bennett's excellent hotel.&#xD;
We both agreed that the man we had seen that day&#xD;
was the true Peter Rugg.&#xD;
'Soon after, I saw Rugg again, at the toll-gate on&#xD;
the Turnpike, between Alexandria and Middle-&#xD;
burgh. While I was paying the toll, I observed to&#xD;
the toll-gatherer, that the drought was more severe&#xD;
in his vicinity than farther south. "Yes," said&#xD;
he, "the drought is excessive; but if I had not&#xD;
heard yesterday, by a traveller, that the man&#xD;
with the black horse was seen in Kentucky a&#xD;
day or two since, I should be sure of a shower in a&#xD;
few minutes."' I looked all around the hc~rizon, and&#xD;
could not discern a cloud that could hold a pint of&#xD;
water. "Look, sir," said the toll-gatherer, "you&#xD;
perceive to the Eastward, just rising that hill a small&#xD;
black eloud not bigger than a black-berry, and while&#xD;
I am speaking it is doubling and tripling itself, and&#xD;
rolling up the turnpike steadily, as if its sole design&#xD;
was to deluge some object." "True," said 1, "1 do&#xD;
perceive it; but what connexion is there between a&#xD;
thunder cloud and a man and horse?" "More than&#xD;
you imagine, or I can tell you; but stop a moment,&#xD;
~r, I may need your assistance. I know that cloud,&#xD;
I have seen it several times before; and can testify&#xD;
to its identity. You will soon see a man and black&#xD;
horse under it." While he was yet speaking, true&#xD;
enough, we began ~to hear the distant thunder, and&#xD;
162&#xD;
&#xD;
soon the chain lightning performed all the figures of&#xD;
a country dan~e. About a mile distant, we saw the&#xD;
man and black horse under the cloud; but before he&#xD;
arrived at the toil-gate, the thunder cloud had spent&#xD;
itself, and not even a sprinkle fell near us. As the&#xD;
man, whom I instantly knew to be Rugg, attempted&#xD;
to pass, the toll-gatherer swung the gate across the&#xD;
road, seized Rugg's horse by the reins, and demand-&#xD;
ed two dollars. Feeling some little regard for Rugg,&#xD;
I interfered, and began to question the toll-gatherer,&#xD;
and requested him not to be wroth with the man.&#xD;
The toll-gatherer replied he had just cause, for the&#xD;
man had run his toll ten times, and moreover that the&#xD;
horse had discharged a cannon ball at him, to the&#xD;
great danger of his life; that the man had always be-&#xD;
fore approached so rapidly that he was too quick for&#xD;
the rusty hinges of the toll-gate; but that now he&#xD;
would have full satisfaction~ Rugg looked wistfully&#xD;
at me, and said, " I entreat you, sir, to delay me not, I&#xD;
have found at length the (lirect road to Boston, and&#xD;
shall not reach hoxpe before night if you detain me:&#xD;
you see I am dripping wet, and ought to change my&#xD;
clothes." The toll-gatherer then demanded why he&#xD;
had run his toll so many times ? ~' Toll! why," said&#xD;
PLugg, "do you demand toll? there ~is no toll to pay&#xD;
on the king's highway." "King's highway! do~you&#xD;
not perceive this is a turnpike ?" "Turnpike! there&#xD;
are 'no turi~pikes in Massachusetts." "That may&#xD;
be, but we have several in Virginia." "Virginia!&#xD;
do you pretend I am in Virginia?" Rugg then ap-&#xD;
pealing to me, asked how far it was to Boston? Said&#xD;
I,"Mr. Rugg, I perceive you are bewildered, and&#xD;
am sorry to see you so far from home; you are, in-&#xD;
deed, in Virginia." "You know me then, sir, it&#xD;
seems~ and you say I am in Virginia. Give me leave&#xD;
to tell you~, sir, you are the most impudent man alive;&#xD;
for I was never forty miles from Boston, and 1 never&#xD;
saw a Virginian in my life. This beats Delaware!"&#xD;
"Your toll, sir, your toll !" "I will not pay you a&#xD;
penny," said Rugg, "you are both of you highway&#xD;

robbers ; there are no turnpikes in this country.&#xD;
Take toll on the king's highway! Robbers take toll&#xD;
on the king's highway." Then in a low tone he&#xD;
said, "here is evidently a conspiracy against me;&#xD;
alas,~ I shall never see Boston! The highways refuse&#xD;
rue a passage, the rivers change their courses, and&#xD;
there is no faith in the compass" But Rugg's horse&#xD;
had no idea of stopping more than one minute, for in&#xD;
the midst of this altercation; the horse, whose nose&#xD;
was resting on the upper bar of the turnpike gate,&#xD;
seize(l jt between his teeth, lifted it gently off its&#xD;
staples, and trotted off With it. The toll-gatherer&#xD;
conlounded, strained his eyes after his gate. Let&#xD;
him go, said I, the horse will soon drop 'your., gate,&#xD;
and you will get it again.&#xD;
I then questioned the toll-gatherer respecting his&#xD;
knowledge of this man~ and he related the following&#xD;
particulars. " The fix~st time," said he, "that man&#xD;
ever passed this toll-gate was in the year 1~O6, at the&#xD;
moment of the great eclipse. I thought the horse&#xD;
was frightened at the sudden darkness, and conclud-&#xD;
ed he had run away with the man. But within a&#xD;
few days 'after, the same man and horse repassed&#xD;
with equal speed, without the least respect to the&#xD;
toll-gate, or to me, except by a vacant stare. Some&#xD;
few years afterward, during the. late war, I saw the&#xD;
same man approaching again, and I resolved to check&#xD;
his career. Accordingly I stepped into the middle&#xD;
of the road, and stretched wide both my arms, and&#xD;
cried, stop sir, on your peril! At this, the man said,&#xD;
'now Lightfoot, confound the robber!' at the same&#xD;
time, he gave the whip liberally to the flank of his&#xD;
horse, who bounded off with sue h force, that it ap-&#xD;
peared to me, two such horses, give them a place to&#xD;
stand, would check the diurnal motion of the earth.&#xD;
An ammunition wagon which had just passed on to&#xD;
Baltimore, had dropped an eighteen pounder in the&#xD;
road; this unlucky ball lay in the way of the horse's&#xD;
heels, and the beast, with the sagacity of a demon,&#xD;
clinched it with one of his heels and hurled it behind&#xD;
164&#xD;
&#xD;

him. I feel dizzy in relating the fact, but SO nearly&#xD;
did the ball pass my head that the wind thereof blew&#xD;
off my hat, and the ball bedded itself in that gate post,&#xD;
as you m~y see, if you will cast your eye to the post.&#xD;
I have permitted it to remain there in memory of the&#xD;
occurrence, as the people oC Boston, I am told, pre-&#xD;
serve the eighteen pounder, which is now to be seen&#xD;
half bedded in Brattle-street church."&#xD;
I then took leave of the toll-gatherer, and promised&#xD;
him, if I saw or heard of his gate, I would send him&#xD;
notice.&#xD;
A strong inclination had possessed me to arrest&#xD;
Rugg, and search his pockets, thinking great dis.-&#xD;
coveries might be made in the examination; but what&#xD;
I saw and heard that d~iy convinced me that no hu-&#xD;
man force could detain Peter Rugg against his con-&#xD;
sent. I therefore determined if I ever saw Rugg&#xD;
again to treat him in the gentlest manner.&#xD;
In pursuing my way to New-York, I entered on&#xD;
the turnpike in Trenton; and when I arrived at&#xD;
New-Brunswick, I perceived the road was newly&#xD;
McAdainised. The small stones had ju4 been laid&#xD;
thereon. As I passed this piece of road, I observed&#xD;
at regular distances of about eight feet, the stones&#xD;
entirely displaced from spots as large as the circum-&#xD;
ference of a half-bushel measure. '17 his singular ap-&#xD;
p earance induced me to inquire the cause of it at the&#xD;
turnpike-gate. "Sir," said the toll-gatherer, "I&#xD;
wonder not at the question, but I am unable to give&#xD;
you a satisfactory answer. Indeed, sir, I believe 1 ani&#xD;
bewitched, and that the turnpike is under a spell of&#xD;
enchantment; for what appeared to me last night&#xD;
cannot be a real transaction; otherwise a turnpike&#xD;
gate is a useless thing." "I do not believe in witch-&#xD;
craft or enchantment," said I, "and if you will re-&#xD;
late circumstantially what happened last night, I will&#xD;
endeavour to account for it by natural means." "You&#xD;
may recollect, the night was uncommonly dark.&#xD;
Well, sir, just after I had closed the gate for the&#xD;
night, down the turnpike, as far as my eye could&#xD;

reach, I beheld, what at first appeared to me, two ar&#xD;
mies engaged. The report of the musketry, and the&#xD;
flashes of their firelocks were incessant and continu-&#xD;
ous. As this strange spectacle approached me with&#xD;
the fary of a tornado, the noise increased, and the&#xD;
appearance rolled on in one compact body over the&#xD;
surface of the ground. The most splendid fireworks&#xD;
rose out of the earth, and encircled this moving spec-&#xD;
tacle. The divers tints of the rainbow, the most&#xD;
brilliant dies that the sun lays on the lap of spring,&#xD;
added to the whole family of gems,.could not display&#xD;
a more beautiful, radiant and dazzling spectacle than&#xD;
accompanied the black horse. You would have&#xD;
thought all the stars of heaven had met in merriment&#xD;
on the turnpike. In the midst of this luminous con-&#xD;
figuration sat a man, distinctly to be seen, in a mis-&#xD;
erable looking chair drawn by a black horse. 'Ihe&#xD;
turnpike-gate, ought, by the laws of nature, and the&#xD;
laws of the state, to have made a wreck of the whole,&#xD;
and have dissolved the enchantment; but no, the&#xD;
horse without an effort passed over the gate, and&#xD;
drew the man and chair horizontally after him with-&#xD;
out touching the bar,. This was what I call enchant-&#xD;
ment-what think you, sir?" " My friend," said I,&#xD;
" you have grossly magnified a natural occurrence.&#xD;
The man was Peter Rugg, on his way to Boston. It&#xD;
is. true, his horse travelled with unequalled speed,&#xD;
but as he reared high his fore-feet, he could not help&#xD;
displacing the thousand small stones on which he&#xD;
trod, which flying in all directions struck each other.&#xD;
and resounded and scintillated. The top bar of&#xD;
your gate is not more than two feet from the ground,&#xD;
and Rugg's horse at every vault could easily lift the&#xD;
carriage over that gate." This satisfied Mr. Mc-&#xD;
Doubt; and I was pleased at that occurrence, for&#xD;
otherwise Mr. McDoubt. who is a worthy .man, late&#xD;
from the Highlands, might have added to his calen-&#xD;
der of superstitions. Having thus disenchanted the&#xD;
McAdamised road, and the turnpike gate, and also&#xD;

K&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
PETER RUGG.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. McDoubt, I pursued my journey homeward to&#xD;
New-York.&#xD;
Little did . expect to see or hear any thing further&#xD;
of Mr. Rugg, for he was now more than twelve hours&#xD;
in advance of me. I could hear nothing of him-on&#xD;
my way to Elizabethtown. I therefore concluded&#xD;
that during the past night he had turned off from the&#xD;
turnpike, and pursuedl a westerly direction. But&#xD;
ust before I arrived at Powles's IHook, I observed a&#xD;
considerable collection of passengers in the ferry&#xD;
boat, all standing motionless, and steadily looking at&#xD;
the same object. One of the ferrymen, Mr. Hardy,&#xD;
who well knew me, observing my approach, delayed&#xD;
a minute, in order to afford me a passage, and coming&#xD;
up, said, "~ Mr. Dunwell, we have got a curiosity on&#xD;
board, that would puzzle Dr. Mitchell." " Some&#xD;
strange fish, I suppose, has found its way into the&#xD;
Hudson." " No," said he, "it is a man, who looks&#xD;
as if he had lain hid in the ark, and had just now ven-&#xD;
-tured out. He has a little girl with him, the coun-&#xD;
terpart of himself; and the finest horse you ever saw,&#xD;
harnessed to the queerest looking carriage that ever&#xD;
was made." " Ah, Mr. Hardy," said I, " you have&#xD;
indeed, hooked a prize; no one before you could&#xD;
ever detain Peter Rugg long enough to examine&#xD;
him." " Do you know -the man ?" said Mr. Hardy.&#xD;
"No, nobody knows him, but every body has seen&#xD;
'him. Detain him as long as possible, delay the boat&#xD;
under any pretence; cut the gear of the horse; do&#xD;
any thing to detain him." As I entered the ferry-&#xD;
boat, I was struck at the spectacle before me; there&#xD;
indeed, sat Peter Rugg and Jenny Rugg in e chair,&#xD;
and there stood the black horse, all as quiet as lambs,&#xD;
surrounded by more than fifty men and w  men, who&#xD;
seemed to have lost all their senses but o e. Not a&#xD;
motion, not a breath, not a nestle. TheW were all&#xD;
eye. Rugg appeared to them to be a man not of tis&#xD;
world; and they appeared to Rugg a strange genera-&#xD;
tion of men. Rugg spoke not, and they spoke not,&#xD;
nor was I disposed to disturb the calm; satisfied, to&#xD;

&#xD;
reconnoitre Rugg in a state of rest. Presently, Rugg&#xD;
ol)sel'ved in a low voice, addressed to nobody, "A&#xD;
new contrivance, horses instead of oars, Boston folks&#xD;
are full of notions." It was plain that Rugg was of&#xD;
Dutch extract-he had on three pair of small clothes,&#xD;
called in former days of simplicity, breeches, not&#xD;
much the worse for wear; but time had prove(l the&#xD;
fabric, and shrunk each of them more than the other,&#xD;
so that they discovered at the knees, their different&#xD;
qualities and colours. His several waistcoats, the&#xD;
flaps of all which rested on his knees, gave him an&#xD;
appearance rather corpulent. His capacious drab&#xD;
coat would supply the stuff for half a dozen modern&#xD;
ones. The sleeves were like meal-bags-in the cuffs&#xD;
of which you might nurse a child to sleep. His hat,&#xD;
probably once black, now of a tan colour, was iien-&#xD;
ther round nor crooked, but much in shape like the&#xD;
one President Monroe wore on his late tour. This&#xD;
dress gave the rotund face of Rugg an antiquated&#xD;
dignity. The man, though deeply sun-burnt, did&#xD;
not appear to be more than thirty years of age. He&#xD;
had lost his sad and anxious look, was quite compos-&#xD;
ed) and seemed happy. The chair in which Rugg&#xD;
sat, was very capacious, evidently made for service,&#xD;
and calculated to last for ages. The timber would&#xD;
supply material for three modern carriages. This&#xD;
chair, like a Nantucket coach, would answer for ev-&#xD;
ery thing that ever went on wheels. The horse too,&#xD;
was an object of curiosity-his majestic height, his&#xD;
natural main and tail gave him a comman(llng ap-&#xD;
pearance-and his large open nostrils indicated in-&#xD;
exhaustible wind. It was apparent that the hoofs of&#xD;
his fore feet had been split, probably on some newly&#xD;
McAdamised road, and were now growing together&#xD;
again; so that John Spring was not altogether in the&#xD;
wrong.&#xD;
How long this dumb scene would otherwise have&#xD;
continued, I cannot tell. Rugg discovered no sign&#xD;
of impatience. But Rugg's horse having been quiet&#xD;
more than five minutes, had no idea of standing&#xD;

idle; lie began to whinny, and in .a moment after,&#xD;
with his right fore foot, he started a plank. Said&#xD;
Rugg, "my horse is impatient, he sees the North&#xD;
end. You must be quick, or he will be ungovernable."&#xD;
At these words, the horse raised his left fore foot;&#xD;
and when he laid it down, every inch of the ferry-&#xD;
boat tremhled, Two men immediately seized Ru~g's&#xD;
horse by the nostrils. The hor~e nodded, and both&#xD;
of them were in the Hudson. While we were 1i~h-&#xD;
rig up the i~en, the horse was perfectly quiet. "Frct&#xD;
not the horse," said Rugg, "and he will do no harm.&#xD;
lie is only anxious, like myself, to arrive at yonder&#xD;
beautiful shore. He sees the North Church, and&#xD;
smells his own stable." " Sir," said Ito Rugg, prac-&#xD;
tisin~ a little deception, "pray tell me, foV 1 am a&#xD;
stranger here, what river is this, and what cty is&#xD;
that opposite? for you seem to be an inhabitant of&#xD;
it." "This river, sir, is called Mystic River, and&#xD;
this is Win nisimet ferry, we have retained the Indian&#xD;
names, an(l that town is Boston. You must, indeed,&#xD;
be a stranger in these parts, not to know that yonder&#xD;
is Boston, the capital of the New-England provin-&#xD;
ces." " Pray sir, how long have you been absent&#xD;
from Boston?" "Why that 1 cannot exactly tell. I&#xD;
lately went with this little girl of mine to Concord,&#xD;
see my friends; and I am ashamed to. teil you in&#xD;
returning lost the way, and have been travelling ever&#xD;
since. No one would directt me right. It is cruel to&#xD;
mislead a traveller. My horse, Lightfoot, has boxed&#xD;
the compass, and it seems to me he has boxed it back&#xD;
again. But, sir, you l)erceive my horse is uneasy,&#xD;
Light foot, as yet, has given only a hint and a nod. I&#xD;
cannot be answerable for his heels." At these words&#xD;
Lightfoot reared his long tail, and snapped it as you&#xD;
would a whip lash. The Hudson reverberated with&#xD;
the sound. Instantly the six horses began to move&#xD;
the boat. The Hud~ori Wd5 a sea of glass, smooth as&#xD;
oil, not a ripple. The horses, from a smart trot, soon&#xD;
pressed into a gallop; water now run over the gun&#xD;
nel; the ferr~y-boat was soon buried in an ocean of&#xD;

foam, and the noise of the spray was like the roaring&#xD;
of many waters. ~When we arrived at New-York,&#xD;
you might see the beautiful white wake of the ferry&#xD;
'boat across the Hudson.&#xD;
Though Rugg refused to pay toll at turnpikes&#xD;
when Mr. Hardy reached his hand for the ferriage,&#xD;
Rugg readily put his hand into one of his many pock-&#xD;
-ets, and took out a piece of silver, and handed it to&#xD;
Hardy. "X What is this?" said Mr. Hardy. -"It is&#xD;
thirty shillings," said Rugg. ." It might have once&#xD;
been thirty shillings, old tenor," said Mr. Hardy,&#xD;
" but it is not at present." "The money is good&#xD;
English coin,'' said Rugg, " my grandfather brought&#xD;
a bag of them from England, and he had them hot&#xD;
from the mint." Hearing this, I approached near to&#xD;
Rugg, and asked permission to see the coin. It was&#xD;
a half crown, coined by the English Parliament,&#xD;
dated i~n the year 1649. On one side " The Common-&#xD;
wealth of England," and St. George's cross encir-.&#xD;
cled with a wreath of laurel. On the other, " God&#xD;
with us," and a harp and St. George's cross united.&#xD;
I winked to Mr. Hardy, and pronounced it good, cur-&#xD;
rent money; and said loudly, I would not permit the&#xD;
gentleman to be imposed on, for I would exchange&#xD;
the money myself. On this, Rugg spoke, " please to&#xD;
give me your name, sir.". " My name is Dunwell,&#xD;
sir," I replied. " Mr. Dunwell," said Rugg, " you&#xD;
are the only honest man I have seen since I left Bos-&#xD;
ton. As you are a stranger here, my house is your&#xD;
home; dame Rugg will be happy to see her hus-&#xD;
band's friend. Step into my chair, sir, there is room&#xD;
enough; move a little, Jenny, for the gentleman, and&#xD;
we will be in Middle street in a minute." Accord-&#xD;
ingly I took a seat by Peter Rugg. " Were you nev-&#xD;
er in Boston before ?" said Rugg." " No," said I&#xD;
"Well, you will now see the queen of New-England,&#xD;
a town second only to Philadelphia, in all North&#xD;
America." " You forget New-York," said I. "Pob,&#xD;
New-York is nothing; though I never was there, I&#xD;
am told you might put all New-York in our Mill&#xD;

PETER RUGG.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pond. .No, sir, New-York I'assure you is but a sor&#xD;
ry affair, no more to be compared to Boston than a&#xD;
wigwam to a palace."&#xD;
As Rugg's horse turned into Pearl street, I looked&#xD;
Rugg as fully in the face as good manners would al-&#xD;
low, and said, "sir, if this is Boston, I acknowledge&#xD;
New-York is not worthy to be one of its suburbs."&#xD;
Before we had proceeded far in Pearl street, Rugg's&#xD;
countenance changed, he began to twitter under his&#xD;
ears, his eyes trembled in their sockets; he was evi-&#xD;
dently bewildered. " What is the matter, Mr. Rugg,&#xD;
you seem disturbed." "'1This surpasses all human&#xD;
comprehension; if you know, sir, where we are, I&#xD;
beseech you to tell me." " If this place," I replied,&#xD;
"is not Boston, it must be New-York." " No, sir, it&#xD;
is not Boston; nor can it be New-York. How could&#xD;
I be in New-York which is nearly two hundred miles&#xD;
from Boston !" By this -time we had passed into&#xD;
Broadway, and then Rugg, in truth, discovered a&#xD;
chaotic mind. There is no such place as this in North&#xD;
America, this is all the effect of enchantment; this is&#xD;
a grand delusion, nothing real; here is seemingly a&#xD;
great city, magnificent houses, shops and goods, men&#xD;
and women innumerable, and as busy as in real life,&#xD;
all sprung up in one night from the wilderness. Or&#xD;
what is more 'probable, some tremendous convulsion&#xD;
of nature has thrown London or Amsterdam on the&#xD;
shores of New-England. Or, possibly, I miay be&#xD;
dreaming, though the night seems rather long, but&#xD;
before now I have sailed in one night to Amsterdam,&#xD;
bought goods of Vandogger, and returned to Boston&#xD;
before morning." At this moment a hue an d cry&#xD;
was heard, "stop the madmen, they will endanger&#xD;
the lives of~ thousands !" In vain hundreds attempted&#xD;
to stop Rugg's horse; Lightfoot interfered with noth-&#xD;
ing, his course was straight as a shooting star. But&#xD;
on my part fearful that before night I should find nmy--&#xD;
self behind the Alleghanies, I addressed Mr. Rugg in&#xD;
a tone of entreaty, and requested him to restrain the&#xD;
horse and permit me to alight. " My friend," said he,&#xD;

but one thing is sufliciently known to every body,&#xD;
that in course of two months, after he iva~ seen in&#xD;
New York, he found his way most opportunely to&#xD;
I3oIon.&#xD;
It seems the estate of Peter Rugg had recently&#xD;
esctwated to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts&#xD;
for want of heirs; an(l the legislature ba(l ordered&#xD;
the Solicitor General to advertise, and sell it at&#xD;
public auction. happening to he in Boston at the&#xD;
time, and observing his advertisement, which dc-&#xD;
~criLed a considerable extent of land, I felt a kindly&#xD;
curiosity to see the spot where llugg once lived.&#xD;
Taking the advertisement in my hand, I wandered&#xD;
a little way down Middle-street, and, without asking&#xD;
a question of any one, when I came to a certain spot,&#xD;
I said to myself, " '1'his is Rugg's estate, I will pro-&#xD;
ceed no further, this niu4 be the spot; it is a coun-&#xD;

looked as if they had accomplished a sad 1irophesy.&#xD;
Fronting on Middle-strcet, they extcn(le(l in the&#xD;
rear to Ann-street, and embraced about half an acre&#xD;
of land. It was not uncommon in former times to&#xD;
have half an acre for a house lot; for an acre of land&#xD;
then, in many f)arts of Bodon, was not more valuable&#xD;
than a foot in some places at l)resent. The old nian~&#xD;
sion hou~e had become powder-post, and been blown&#xD;
away. One other building, urn nhabitett, 'toed orni-&#xD;

&#xD;
much raised, that the bed chamber had descended&#xD;
to the kitchen, and was level with the street. The&#xD;
house seeme(l con~ejous of its fate, and, as though&#xD;
tired of standing there, the front was fast retreating&#xD;
from the rear, and waiting the next south wind to&#xD;
pr~~eet itself into the street. If the mo4 ~vary ani-&#xD;
mals had sought a place of refuge, here they would&#xD;
have rendezvoused. Here, under the ridge pole,&#xD;
the crow would have perched in security, and in the&#xD;
recesses below, you might have caught the fox and&#xD;
the weasel asleep. The hand of destiny, said I, has&#xD;
presse(l heavy on this spot; still heavier on the form-&#xD;
er owners. Strange that so large a lot of land as&#xD;
this should want an heir! Yet Peter Rugg, at this&#xD;
day, might pass by his own door stone, and ask,&#xD;
" who once lived there ~&#xD;
The auctioneer, appointed by. the Solicitor, to&#xD;
sell this estate, was a man of eloqr~ence, as many of&#xD;
the auctioneers of Boston are. TJ occasion seem-&#xD;
ed to warrant, and~is duty urged him to make a dis-&#xD;
play. He address his audiemice as follows: " The&#xD;
estate, gentlemen, which we offer you this day, was&#xD;
once the property of a family now extinct. It has&#xD;
escheated to the Commonwealth for wa-nt of heirs.&#xD;
Lest any one of you should be deterredd from bidding&#xD;
on so large an estate as this, for fear o~' a diTuted&#xD;
title, I am authorized. by the Solicitor General, to&#xD;
proclaim that the purchaer shall have the best of all&#xD;
titles, a warranty deed from the Commonwealth. I&#xD;
state this, gentlemen, because I know there is an&#xD;
idle rumour in this vicinity, that one Peter Rugg,&#xD;
the original owner of this estate, is still living.&#xD;
This rumour, gentlemen, has no Ibundation, and can&#xD;
have no foundation in the nature of things. It ori-&#xD;
ginated, about two years since, from the incredible&#xD;
story of one Jonathan Dunwell of New York. Mrs.&#xD;
Croft, indeed, whose husband I see present, and&#xD;
whose mouth waters (~r this estate, has counte-&#xD;

Bid then liberally, and do not let the name of Rugg&#xD;
damp your ardour. i-low inuch will you give per foot&#xD;

gracefully waved his ivory hammer. From fifty to&#xD;
seventy-f~ve cents per foot, were offered in a few&#xD;
moments. It laboured from seventy-five to ninety.&#xD;
At length one dollar was offered. The auctioneer&#xD;
seemed satisfied; and looking at his watch, said he&#xD;
would knock off the estate in five minutes, if no one&#xD;
offered more. There was a deep silence, during this&#xD;
short period. While the hammer was suspended, a&#xD;
strange rumbling noise was heard which arrested the&#xD;
attention of every one. Presently, it was like the&#xD;
sound of many shipwrights driving home the bolts of&#xD;
a seventy-four. As the sound approached nearer,&#xD;
some exclaimed, "the buildings in the new market&#xD;
are falling in promiscuous ruins." Others said" no;&#xD;
it is an earthquake, we perceive the earth joggle."&#xD;
Others said" not so; the sound proceeds from flanover&#xD;
street, and approaches nearer;" and this proved true,&#xD;
for presently Peter Rugg was in the midst of us.&#xD;
"Alas, Jenny," said Peter, "I am ruined; our&#xD;
house has been burnt, and here are all our neigh-&#xD;
bours around the ruins. Heaven grant your mother&#xD;
4ame Rugg is safe." "They don't look like our&#xD;
neighbours," said Jenny, "but sure enough our&#xD;
house is burnt, and nothing left but the door stone,&#xD;
and an old cedar post-do ask where mother is?"&#xD;

trarted more attention than the auctioneer. The&#xD;
confident look an(l searching eves of Rugg, to every&#xD;
one present, carri#~d more conviction, that the estate&#xD;
was his, than could any parchment or paper with sig~&#xD;
nature an] seal. 'Fhe impression which the auc-&#xD;
tioneer ha! *ju4 made on the company was effaced in&#xD;
a moment: awl although the latter wordsof the auc-&#xD;
tioneer were, "fear not Peter Rugg," the moment&#xD;
the auctioneer met the eye of Ilugg, his occupation&#xD;
was gone, his arm fell down to his hips, his late live-&#xD;
ly hammer hung heavy in his hand, and the auction&#xD;
was forgotten. The black horse, too, gave his evi-&#xD;
dence. He knew his journey was ended, for he&#xD;
stretched himself into a horse and a half, rested his&#xD;
cheek bone over the cedar post, and whinneyed&#xD;
thrice, causing his harness to tremble from head~ta11&#xD;
tocrupper. Rugg, then, stood upright in his chair,&#xD;
and asked with some\authoritv, "Who has (lemolish-&#xD;

ANECDOTE OF KING GEORGE III.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT is known that the king, after the close of the&#xD;
American revolutionary war, ordered a thanksgiving&#xD;
to be kept through the kingdom. A noble Scotch&#xD;
divine, in the presence of his majesty, inquired,&#xD;
"For what are we to give thanks ?-that your ma~jes-.&#xD;
ty has lost thirteen of his best provinces ?" The king&#xD;
answered, " No!" " Is it, then (the divine added,)&#xD;
that your majesty has lost 100,000 lives of your sub-&#xD;
iectsin the contest ?" " No, no!" said the king.&#xD;
" Is it, then, that we have expended and lost a hun-&#xD;
dred millions of money, and for .the defeat and tarn--&#xD;
ishing of your majesty's arms?"-" No such thing!"&#xD;
said the king pleasantly. " What, then, is the ob-&#xD;
ject of the thanksgiving?" " Oh, to give. thanks&#xD;
that it is no worse."&#xD;

&#xD;
PETRIFIED CORPSE.&#xD;
ON the 81st May, 1781, a grave was opened to&#xD;
make way for another coffin at Hathersedge, in Der'-&#xD;
byshire, a village on the road between Castleton and&#xD;
Sheffield. Inihis grave Benjamin Ashton had been&#xD;
buried on the 29th of December, 1725, aged forty-.&#xD;
two, his coffin was opened either from accident or&#xD;
curiosity, when his body was discovered, the whole&#xD;
mass quite petrified, -not incrusted, but the whole&#xD;
substance changed to stone. -The appearance induc-&#xD;
ed the people to take it out of the coffin, in doing&#xD;
which, the head was broken off, and shewed that&#xD;
the whole substance was become a solid mass.&#xD;
The likeness remained so strong that some who&#xD;
knew him when alive, remembered his features&#xD;
perfectly.-His face and belly were swarthy, the&#xD;
underparts of a somewhat different colour. It was&#xD;
replaced in the coffin and buried again. The coffin&#xD;
Which was made of oak plank, one inch and a half&#xD;
thick, was as sound as when put into the ground,&#xD;
and was without any appearance of petrifaction&#xD;
about it,!&#xD;
There was a strong spring of water in the grave,&#xD;
which had made its way into the coffin, yet had made&#xD;
uno change in that, nor has it been otherwise known&#xD;
to possess a petrifying quality.&#xD;

I AROSE early in the morning, and after. taking a&#xD;
good breakfast, set out from home. A quantity of&#xD;
rain had fallen in the night. It was, however, fair&#xD;
when I commenced my expedition, and I wished it&#xD;
so to remain. The morning was still and beautiful;&#xD;
it was at the early hour of four; I could not yet distin-&#xD;
-guish the sun, though 1 was sensible he had left his&#xD;
ocean bed from the beautiful streaks of colouring&#xD;
in the eastern sky. To express the softness, mild&#xD;
ness, and calmness of the scenery, at that hour, I can-&#xD;
not find adequate words; those only can conceive it&#xD;
who have witnessed the scene. I had not proceeded&#xD;
more than two miles, before a few drops alarmed me&#xD;
with apprehension of a soaking shower, from a heavy&#xD;
black cloud that was slowly sailing over my head,&#xD;
and my fears were soon realized by -a very. thick&#xD;
descent that followed, on which I betook myself with&#xD;
all speed to a thatched cottage, that  a  tsm&#xD;
distance, for shelter.tIsa             atom&#xD;
Many years had elapsed since I had wandered&#xD;
about in this spot in careless infancy, and the pretty&#xD;
secluded cot to which I was advancing, had been my&#xD;
home. I looked around on the hills and dales, and&#xD;
:ould easily recognise them as my old acquaintances.&#xD;
" Ha" said I, " ye change not your appearance, ye&#xD;

years past, my eyes behold the still sunshine sleeping&#xD;
upon your gentle sloping declivities, interrupted on&#xD;
ly when the light cloud of spring, for a moment, casts&#xD;
over them its passing shadow! My cogitations were&#xD;
suddenly interrupted by the gate at the end of the&#xD;
pasture, which I opened. In another moment I was&#xD;
in the porch of the cottage; I lifted the latch, and&#xD;
went in. The house appeared just the same as I ha'&#xD;
left it ten years before. The furniture was the same&#xD;
and each piece occupied the same position. The oh.&#xD;
clock stood ticking in the corner, as it had done for&#xD;
four score years, the oaken settle remained behind the&#xD;
door, and my uncle's antique two armed chair by the&#xD;
fire-side; but I saw no living creature in the house&#xD;
besides the cat on the hearthstone. I listened awhile,&#xD;
but could hear nothing. At this I rather wondered,&#xD;
as of yore the house was seldom, scarcely ever, total-&#xD;
ly deserted. Lihen went forward into the spence, or&#xD;
country parlour, where I found several neighbour&#xD;
cousins and the servants, all standing in deep silence&#xD;
around the bed of my dying uncle.&#xD;
On entering, all eyes turned upon me; I was a&#xD;
stranger to most of them; there were, however, one&#xD;
or two who remembered me. I advanced to the bed-&#xD;
side, and the countenance of my uncle for a moment&#xD;
brightened up at my approach, but soon subsided&#xD;
again into a cold tranquil indifference. It was plain&#xD;
that death was rapidly approaching. He had been&#xD;
speechless several hours; consequently we could hold&#xD;
no conversation. He, however, put out his hand,&#xD;
which I grasped with an affection redoubled by the&#xD;
prospect of soon losing him forever. In my younger&#xD;
days I had lived with him, and he having no children&#xD;
182&#xD;
&#xD;
TIlE GHOST 01' MY UNCLE.&#xD;
of his own, was then remarkably fond of me; subse-.&#xD;
quently that affection was strengthened between us,&#xD;
and although circumstances had cast my lot in an-&#xD;
other country, yet we had kept up a friendly and&#xD;
affectionate intercourse. Some time previous to his&#xD;
indisposition, I had again removed to within thirty&#xD;
miles of his residence, which was the place from&#xD;
whence I set out on this sorrowful visit.&#xD;
My uncle was a man of sound judgment, keen ob~&#xD;
servation, and cheerful social disposition, joined to a&#xD;
thorough knowledge of mankind' he possessed a&#xD;
good portion of eccentricity and humour, lie loved&#xD;
a cheerful glass; he was kind to his servants and de-&#xD;
pendants, and though rather of a frugal and saving&#xD;
disposition, yet he was charitable to his poor neigh-&#xD;
oours. In his friendships he was rather capricious,&#xD;
but firm in his attachment to the kirk and govern-&#xD;
ment of his country. He was apt to be a little pas~&#xD;
sionat and hasty in his temper; but his resentment&#xD;
was se-I dom of long duration. He was well beloved&#xD;
by those among whom he dwelt, and might be pro-&#xD;
nounced a good neighbour, and an excellent subject.&#xD;
By a long course of industry in his profession, he had&#xD;
amassed a pretty good property, the knowledge of&#xD;
b&#xD;
which had drawn around him a host of needy rela-&#xD;
tions, who besieged him with flattery and professions,&#xD;
but whose attentions were chiefly drawn forth by&#xD;
their hopes of inheriting the old man's property.&#xD;
How he had willed it was not known. He was a&#xD;
man of prudence, and seldom blabbed out his private&#xD;
affairs.&#xD;
On my arrival, I found all the friends about him&#xD;
remarkably attentive and duteous in their behaviour,&#xD;
though it was evident that a good deal of the affec-.&#xD;
tion was assumed. Shortly after, he fell into a kind&#xD;
of a doze, and all left the room save an attendant or&#xD;
two. Peggy, the servant who had lived with my un-&#xD;
cle fourteen years, now insisted on my taking some&#xD;
refreshment. But I was too much agitated to feel&#xD;
any thing like pleasure in my repast, and what I ate&#xD;

was more to please the faithful old domestic, than&#xD;
from any inclination of my own. When my slight&#xD;
meal was over, I got up and went to the window in&#xD;
a serious and reflecting mood. The afternoon was,&#xD;
far advanced, and the scenery without was wrapped&#xD;
in tranquillity. I was soon summoned from my sta-&#xD;
tion to the parlour. My uncle had somewhat re-&#xD;
vived, and his speech had returned. He told us&#xD;
death was making rapid advances, and that we might&#xD;
soon expect th~ moment of his dissolution, He in-&#xD;
formed us where we should find his ivill, and gave&#xD;
us some excellent advice on our future conduct.&#xD;
Some things he requested us to perform, which I&#xD;
thought were a Jittle odd. He wished us to read his&#xD;
will in the room where he was, immediately after he&#xD;
had expired. He desired that he might not be laid&#xD;
out, as it is commonly called, until at least twelve&#xD;
hours after his departure; that his large two armed&#xD;
oaken chair might be placed in all order and solem-&#xD;
nity at the head of the table every meal, and that it&#xD;
should remain unoccupied till after his funeral. He&#xD;
also wished to be interred in a very deep grave. All&#xD;
these requests we promised faithfully to observe,&#xD;
when, after taking an affectionate farewell of each,&#xD;
he quietly resigned himself to his pillow; his breath-&#xD;
ing became more and more faint, till at last we could&#xD;
perceive it no more.&#xD;
During these transactions my mind was in a state&#xD;
I cannot well describe: my thoughts were all con-&#xD;
fusion, while at the same time I struggled to be caIn~&#xD;
and composed. Poignant as were my feelings, I&#xD;
gazed on my dying relative with a sort of apathy&#xD;
and grief, and at the moment when nature was yield-&#xD;
ing up the contest I could not shed a tear. In a&#xD;
short time all quitted the apartment, and I was left&#xD;
alone. 'l'he branches of the huge elm trees, with&#xD;
their thickening foliage, partially screening the win-&#xD;
dow, made it, under such circumstances, awfully&#xD;
gloomy and tranquil. I took several turns about the&#xD;
room, and with a soft step I approached the bed,&#xD;

gazed a moment, turned away, and then going up&#xD;
to the window, strove to divert my thoughts by look-&#xD;
ing at the surrounding landscape. rrxvilf~ht was de-&#xD;
scending, and the sober hues of evening gradually&#xD;
enveloped the lofty hills. No sound struck my ear,&#xD;
except the faint and low murmurs of the brook,&#xD;
which brawled down the valley at the bottom of the&#xD;
Flinty Knowe~-the shout, softened by distance, of&#xD;
the Peasant committing his herds to the pasture-&#xD;
and now and then the solitary barking of a shep~&#xD;
herd's dog amng the echoing dales, attendant on&#xD;
his master looking out his charge for the night.&#xD;
I had not stood at the casement many minutes&#xD;
when my cousins, all talking in a rude, noisy, and&#xD;
indecorous manner, came into the room with the&#xD;
will, which it seems they had departed in search of&#xD;
the moment the testator had expired. I was a good&#xD;
deal shocked at the frivolity they manifested, and&#xD;
could not help reproving them, though in a mild and&#xD;
gentle manner, for the little respect they paid to the&#xD;
(leceased. "\Vhy ye ken," said one, "he tauld us&#xD;
to read the will amaist as soon as he died." "Ay,"&#xD;
cried another, " and sac in conformity xvi' his com~&#xD;
ruand, we went straight up the stairs and rummaged&#xD;
o'er his auld kist, till we found it." " Mind your&#xD;
am concerns, gude man, and we'll mind oui~s," re-&#xD;
joined a third, rather gruffly; so that my well meant&#xD;
admonitions had no better effect than to cause me to&#xD;
be more disliked by the party; for I could perceive&#xD;
before this that they looked on me in the light of an&#xD;
unwelcome intruder.&#xD;
The will was now read, to which all paid the&#xD;
greatest attention. A mute anxiety and* deep in-&#xD;
terest sat on every countenance: their aspects were&#xD;
however, instantly changed into those of intense dis-&#xD;
appointment and vexation, on hearing that my uncle&#xD;
had made a stranger, whom none of us knew, the&#xD;
heir of all his property, real and personal. For my&#xD;
p art, this circumstance did not affect me in the&#xD;
I east. I had not had, any expectation of inheriting&#xD;

&#xD;
the smallest l)ortion; therefore could not feel disap-&#xD;
pointed. But with the others it was different; they&#xD;
had clung to him like so many leeches, or like the&#xD;
ivy to the old ruinand with about as much affec-&#xD;
tion as the two before-mentioned things have for the&#xD;
objects to which they so 'closely adhere. A most ap-&#xD;
palling and disgusting scene now took place among&#xD;
the disappointed legacy hunters. They 'abused the&#xD;
01(1 man in the most shocking terms: they taxed him&#xD;
with injustice and villany, and even proceeded to&#xD;
call down imprecations upon his lifeless corse. I&#xD;
shuddered at the conduct of the unprincipled vii-&#xD;
lains; I trembled at the impiety of men who could,&#xD;
at a time the most solemn and impressive to a human&#xD;
being, act in a manner sufficient to call down upon&#xD;
them immediate and divine vengeance. I was chill-&#xD;
ed with horror. I almost expected every moment&#xD;
to see the lifeless. corse of my uncle start from the&#xD;
bed, on which it lay, to take vengeance on the au-&#xD;
dacious wretches. Once, indeed, I actually thought&#xD;
I saw his lips quiver with rage-h is eyebrows knit&#xD;
together-and all the muscles of his countenance&#xD;
contract into a dreadful frown. I shuddered at the&#xD;
sight and withdrew my gaze.&#xD;
At length they went into the kitchen, and I was&#xD;
once more left alone in the chamber of death. I&#xD;
went to the bed-side, and the scene I had just wit-&#xD;
nessed operated so forcibly on my feelings, that I&#xD;
i~urst into tears, and uttered aloud my lamentations&#xD;
over my lifeless relative. When this ehullition had&#xD;
somewhat subsided, I began to reflect a little where&#xD;
was, and a sort of timidity came creeping over me.&#xD;
There isan undefinable apprehension which we feel&#xD;
while we are in company with the dead. We ima-&#xD;
gine, in spite of the efforts of reason, that the depart-&#xD;
c(l spirit is hovering near its former tenement. It&#xD;
being now quite dark, and having these P~elings in a&#xD;
strong degree, it is no wonder that I rather preferred&#xD;
the company of the wretches in the kitchen, than to&#xD;
remain long where I was.&#xD;
186&#xD;
&#xD;
I accordingly proceeded thither, where I found&#xD;
them all car'ousing round a large table, on which&#xD;
were placed the fragments of the innere, and plenty&#xD;
of liquor.' I reminded them of our promise to place&#xD;
mY uncle's 01(1 two armed chair at the head of the&#xD;
table, as he had requested, which they ha4neglected&#xD;
to do, and which they now strenuously opposed my&#xD;
(loing. I was, however, resolut~elv determined to&#xD;
have it done, and at length succeeded. I then re-&#xD;
tire(l to the fire-side, where I sat, without taking any&#xD;
part in the conversation, or any thing that passed&#xD;
during the whole evening. I shall pass over the&#xD;
several succeeding hours, the whole of which they&#xD;
sat -drinking, till they were all in a greater or less&#xD;
degree intoxicated, and generally brawling' wran-&#xD;
gling, and swearing in a loud and boisterous man-&#xD;
ncr. The night became stormy as it advanced.&#xD;
The wind arose, and at intervals moaned, sighed,&#xD;
an(l whistled shrilly without, roared in the wide&#xD;
chimney , and as it furiously bent the trees in which&#xD;
the house was embosomed, made a sound similar to&#xD;
the dashing of the waves on the shore of the ocean.&#xD;
The rain fell in torrents, and the large drops patter-&#xD;
ed against the window with a ceaseless and melan-&#xD;
choly cadence.&#xD;
It was now getting nigh the "witching time of&#xD;
night," and I saw no signs of the revellers quitting&#xD;
the table. On the contrary, they grew more loud&#xD;
and boisterous. In obedience to their imperious&#xD;
commands, yet evidently with the greatest reluct-&#xD;
ance, Peggy had kept replenishing the exhausted&#xD;
vessels with more liquor, and their demands increas-&#xD;
ed in proportion to the reluctance with which they&#xD;
were satisfied. At length, however, on receiving an&#xD;
intimation from me that I would interpose, she abso-&#xD;
lutely refused to draw any more liquor for them,&#xD;
telling them they had had plenty, and that it was&#xD;
tune to retire to bed. The scene that now ensued&#xD;
was such as is impossible for me to describe; mad&#xD;
dened and inflamed witk rage at being thus refused,&#xD;

the wretcnes began to throw the furniture up and&#xD;
down the house, break the glasses and jugs, and to&#xD;
abuse the servant, from whom they attempted to&#xD;
wrest the keyof the cellar, yelling out at the same&#xD;
time the most horrid oaths and imprecations.&#xD;
The table was shortly oversee, and the lights put&#xD;
out in the scuffle, and in a few moments we should,&#xD;
in all probability, have had blood shed, as I felt my-&#xD;
self roused to a pitch of fury, and was advancing&#xD;
with the large heavy headed fire-poker to the assist-&#xD;
ance of the servant, who was loudly shrieking for&#xD;
help: just then the old clock struck twelve rapid&#xD;
strokes, and the bell had not ceased to vibrate, when&#xD;
we heard three heavy knocks, as if given by a mallet&#xD;
upon the wall, which separated the kitchen from the&#xD;
parlour where my unc&#xD;
something         le lay. There appeared to be&#xD;
~upernaturaI in this. The whole house&#xD;
seemed to shake to its very foundation. A deep si~&#xD;
lence ensued. I stood still. The wretches instantly&#xD;
became sober. 'We all gazed earnestly and wil(lly at&#xD;
the place, from whence the noise proceeded. Scarce&#xD;
had we recovered from the shock, when we were&#xD;
again thund~*struck with a noise in the parlour; it&#xD;
was unlike any sound that I had ever heard before.&#xD;
It seemed as if all the furniture in the room was&#xD;
violently crashed together, mingled with the noise&#xD;
of fire-arms. Shrieks and exclamations burst from&#xD;
all.&#xD;
The windows shook and every door of the habi.~&#xD;
station gave a momentary jar. I trembled with awe.&#xD;
I felt every hair of my head bristling upwards-my&#xD;
knees smote against each other-a (leathly paleness&#xD;
sat on every countenance, and all eyes were fixed in&#xD;
an intense gaze on the door, at the upper part of the&#xD;
kitchen, which led to the staircase, buttery, and par-&#xD;
lour. When, to complete the horror of the scene,&#xD;
the door burst wide open-dashed against the ~vall,&#xD;
and in, gliding at a slow pace, came a dreadful ap.&#xD;
partition. Its countenance was that of death. It&#xD;
seemed to have been long the inhabitant of that dark&#xD;

&#xD;
THE GHOST OF MY UNCLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
an(l narrow house-the grave; the worms had revel~&#xD;
led upon its eyes, and left nothing but the orbiess&#xD;
sockets. The rest of the skeleton was enveloped in&#xD;
a long and white sheet. The horrid spectre advanc-&#xD;
ed into the middle of the room. I involuntarily&#xD;
shrunk back-the heavy weapon dropped from my&#xD;
hand and rang loudly on the stone floor; overcome&#xD;
with terror, I sank into a chair. 4A cold sweat broke&#xD;
from my forehead, and I had well nigh fainted on its&#xD;
first appearance; the others had tumbled one over&#xD;
the other, in the greatest horror and confusion,&#xD;
and now lay as if dead in all directions.&#xD;
The spectre gazed wildly round for a moment--at&#xD;
the clock-at the fire---and then turned its eyeles~&#xD;
sockets upon each individual, motion in~ at the same&#xD;
time with its Ion rarmd&#xD;
,,,an pointing t~ the outer&#xD;
door, seemingly directing to an outlet Tor escape,&#xD;
and wishing for their exif. They were not long m&#xD;
obeying this intimation, but severally crawled away&#xD;
ontheir hands and knees, with all the speed they&#xD;
could possibly make; none of them daring to slant]&#xD;
upright. The spectre all the while was ~1andjng&#xD;
in the middle of the floor, eyeing, or rather appear-&#xD;
ing to eye them, through the void socket~, where&#xD;
eyes had once gli4ened, as they. retreate(l one by&#xD;
one in the greatest fear and trepidation. XVhe~i&#xD;
Peggy and I offered to decamp along with the rest,&#xD;
the spectre motioned us to remain where we were.&#xD;
and we durst not for our lives disobey. When the&#xD;
last of the crew was making his exit, and had crawl&#xD;
ed nearly to the door, the spectre, which had hither-&#xD;
to stood motionless, except waving its arm and&#xD;
slowly turning its eyeless countenance on the wretch-&#xD;
es as they crept successively out of the door, bounded&#xD;
with the rapidity of lightning after the terrified&#xD;
wretch. But swift as the flight of spirits are, in this&#xD;
ease that of the mortal was swifter: the fellow gave&#xD;
a thrilling scream-made a convulsive spring-his&#xD;
heels struck violently against the lintel of the door&#xD;
in his course, and he vanished from my sight and&#xD;

the spectre after him. "Gude defend us," said Peg~&#xD;
gy. "For my part, ill as I was frightened, I could&#xD;
scarce forbear laughing outright at the last incident&#xD;
SO comical and farcical."&#xD;
Half a minute had not elapsed, when I heard a&#xD;
step, and in another instant (I still kept my eyes on&#xD;
the door) in came the very form of my uncle, mut-&#xD;
term g, "Villains' Rascals! Hypocrites!" lie fas-&#xD;
tene d the door after him, shut out his nephews and&#xD;
the spectre, and then can:e towards the fire. At this&#xD;
I was more amazed than ever He, however, gave&#xD;
me to understand that he was alive and well, and&#xD;
that all I had seen transacted in the afternoon and&#xD;
evening, was nothing but a stratagem he had made&#xD;
use of to try the sincerity of his relations, and if he&#xD;
found theni, as he conjectured, false in their pro-&#xD;
fessions, to get rid of them. T he scheme answered&#xD;
nobly, and, it must be confessed, the stratagem was&#xD;
well planned and exceedingly wall executed.&#xD;
My uncle concluded his relation with assuring me,&#xD;
that, excepting a good legacy for his faithful servant&#xD;
PeggyIsh ould inherit all that he possessed, as some&#xD;
little acknowledgment for the fright he had caused&#xD;
me; and as for the wretches he had expelled from&#xD;
his house, in so singular a manner, they should never&#xD;
more cross the threshold of his door. We all three&#xD;
now sat down to a little supper, of which my uncle&#xD;
stood in great need, and after taking a cheer&#xD;
retired to bed.                         ful glass&#xD;
Notwithstanding the fatigue of my journey, and&#xD;
sitting up so late, my sleep was far from being sound&#xD;
and refreshing. I was disturbed with fearful dreams&#xD;
the whole night. At length~ the cocks began to crow&#xD;
-the clouds of the eastern sky to break asunder, and&#xD;
the morning to dawn. When it was tolerably light&#xD;
I started up, resolved on a stroll over the meadows.&#xD;
Before going out, however, I went into the parlour,&#xD;
where I found every thing in the utmost confusion.&#xD;
Chairs, tables, walking-sticks, and logs of wood, lay&#xD;
all over the floor, and every thing upset or in a xv~ong&#xD;
190&#xD;
&#xD;
position. I then proceeded to the outer door, which&#xD;
I opened, but started back in horror, on perceiving&#xD;
a human skull lying on a sheet at my right hand,&#xD;
just without the door. Recovering from my fright,&#xD;
gathered d it up,~an d could not restrain my laughter,&#xD;
when I discover ~ d it to be nothing more than a mask,&#xD;
representing a death's head. It seems while we were&#xD;
all wrangling tl4e night before, my uncle had step-&#xD;
C(l out of bed-dressed himself-piled all the furni-&#xD;
iire, logs of wood and timber, he could in the apart-&#xD;
ment, in a heap, crowning the pyramid with a dozen&#xD;
or more walking-sticks, which had lain time out of&#xD;
mind on the top of an old cupboard-then gone up&#xD;
stairs and put on the horrid mask-brought down a&#xD;
pistol, and enveloped himself from his feet to his&#xD;
chin, in a clean white sheet; after alarming us, just&#xD;
as the clock struck the awful hour of twelve, by&#xD;
striking three heavy blows against the wall with a&#xD;
huge log of wood, he contrived to tumble down the&#xD;
whole mass of furniture at once-fired his pistol at&#xD;
the same moment, and then burst in upon us in the&#xD;
manner described.&#xD;
I now went out. As I was crossing the yard, I&#xD;
discovered several drops of blood on a stone, Which&#xD;
I could no way account for, but by supposing some&#xD;
of my good cousins had received, in their retreat, a&#xD;
fall; and, a little further, I discovered a pair of shoes.&#xD;
A receptacle for the filth of the byre, in another&#xD;
p art of the yard, bore evident marks of some one&#xD;
l~avin~ had therein a severe struggle.&#xD;
Indeed the adventures of the flying heroes had&#xD;
been various and woeful; one of them, he at whom&#xD;
the spectre made such a sudden bound, as I after-&#xD;
wards ascertained, actually ran seven miles without&#xD;
stopping, and with his shrieks, supposing the grim&#xD;
monster close at his heels, almost raised the whole&#xD;
country. I now proceeded trnwards over the fields,&#xD;
listening to the warbling l&amp;amp;rk "springing blithely&#xD;
up to greet the purpling east." The air was fresh&#xD;
and pure, and, in the beauties of nature, I awhile&#xD;

breakfast.&#xD;
SIR ,RICHARD sTEELE AND THE SEVEN BULLs.&#xD;
Sia Richard- Steele once went with a party to a&#xD;
ebountry town, where they dined. While dinner was&#xD;
preparing, Sir Richard made many blunders in his&#xD;
conversation. His friends rallied him, and said that&#xD;
he made more bulls than .all the company beside.&#xD;
Sir Richard retorted, with some warmth, that he did&#xD;
not know that he-made more bulls than any other&#xD;
p~erson. One of the company insisted that he did,&#xD;
and offered to lay a dozen of wvine that he would&#xD;
make a b 11 before the cloth was withdrawn that&#xD;
was then laying. I'he wager was accepted; and&#xD;
dinner being served up, the conversation turned on&#xD;
the number of signs of the Bull in that town, anid&#xD;
they began to enumerate them. One said there&#xD;
were six; another said there were seven; .but they&#xD;
could not make any more than six when counting&#xD;
them over by their different colours. While they&#xD;
were considering where the seventh was, Sir Richard&#xD;
exclaimed, "By St. Patrick, you have forgotten the&#xD;
Red Cow at the foot of the bridge.." On which his&#xD;
opponent said; " That is a bull!" " Is it so, sir,,;.&#xD;
said Sir Rcard, "then you-have made one of it,&#xD;
for it was a cow when I saw it last."-The bet was&#xD;
determined in favour of Sir Richard'.&#xD;

&#xD;
JoiHN 'AUDLEY was a good simple soul, a parish&#xD;
clerk and a cobbler, and lived at Eccleston in Lanca-&#xD;
shire; wherc he had§ many years exercised these re-&#xD;
spect able functions entirely to his own satisfaction,&#xD;
and, generally speaking, to the content of the good&#xD;
folks of the villa-e. His talents were held in much&#xD;
estimation by the lads and lasses in the neighbour-&#xD;
hood: he had assisted at most of the christenings,&#xD;
-mended their shoes,.cut their valentines, pronounced&#xD;
Amen, and sung Arthur O'Bradley at their wed-&#xD;
dings; and was famous for having himself, three&#xD;
several times in his life, seen the Shriekin~g 'Woman,&#xD;
and the apparition of the Murdered Tinker. He&#xD;
also told more stories of ghosts and hobgobhins than&#xD;
any person in Eccleston, Dame Dickson the midwife&#xD;
alon exAudley's customers, like the houses of the&#xD;
parish where he lived, lay scattered. He had been,&#xD;
on a winter evening, to carry home a pair of mende&#xD;
shoes to Farmer Down's; and was returning by moon-&#xD;
light, half petrified with fear, and endeavouring to&#xD;
whistle away from remembrance the story of the&#xD;
Tall Woman in 'White, and her Headless Horse;&#xD;
when sud denly a four-footed creature brushed bfy him,&#xD;
and a voice thundered through his ears-" Hey, Fire-.&#xD;

have mercy upon me !" said John Audley, and again&#xD;
the thing passed him swift as dust blown by a whirl&#xD;

wind. John's legs were exceelingly willing to run,&#xD;
but wanted the power, and therefore stopped. His&#xD;
eyes Were fixed upon two animals that he saw ap-&#xD;
proaching; they appeared of a frightihi magnitude&#xD;
and figure: one of them walked upright, and the&#xD;
other on all-fours; both had heads as rough as a Rus-&#xD;
Sian bear, an(l both grew bigger and bigger as they&#xD;
4rew near.&#xD;
"In the name of the Father, Son, and--" "Bow,&#xD;
Wow !" replied Firetail, cutting short John Audley's&#xD;
invocation. "Ab, rascal! keep close, devil !" said&#xD;
the upright apparition, and Firetail growled and&#xD;
retreated. "Lord have mercy upon me !" ag~in&#xD;
said John Audley, who imagined the devil was only&#xD;
restrained for a moment, that he might return with&#xD;
greater fury. "How now, friend !" said Firetail's&#xD;
master: "What, are you at prayers in this place?&#xD;
what, do you go down upon your marrow bones?"&#xD;
"I charge you, in the name of God," answered John,&#xD;
"tell me, be you a Christian, a ghost, or a devil?"&#xD;
"Neither." "'Wh-wh..what are you then?" "A&#xD;
merry fellow, a traveller, and moreover, a story-&#xD;
teller." "And is not that an evil spirit by your&#xD;
side ?" "An evil spirit !-.~W~hat, Firetail ?-A bottle-&#xD;
conjurer !" "Lord preserve me !" "A calf's head&#xD;
and cabbage. Lie down, sirrah! Be 9uiet, dog's&#xD;
face! You would find him an evil spirit if I were to&#xD;
let him loose upon you, perhaps." "I pray you,&#xD;
don't !-I pray you don't !2-~-My name's John A udley-&#xD;
I am a poor harmless man, and a parish clerk, and&#xD;
mortally afraid of evil spirits."&#xD;
John Audley, by the arguments of the stranger,&#xD;
Was half inclined, after a deal of persuasion, to be-&#xD;
lieve him real flesh and blood; that Firetail was a&#xD;
rough Newfoundland dog; and that the hairy head&#xD;
of his master was a shaggy goat-skin cap, made in a&#xD;
whimsical form; so that the eyes, (that is, eyes of&#xD;
glass) face, and horns, were preserved. Such an ap-&#xD;
parition, at snch a time, and in such a place, might&#xD;
have startled a stouter man than John Audley:&#xD;

THE BLEEDING FINGER.&#xD;
but though he began to suspect him not to be ac~&#xD;
tually the devil, he remained firmly persuaded he&#xD;
must be a conjurer at least; and this opinion was&#xD;
confirmed, both by his head-dress, which exact-&#xD;
ly tallied with John's ideas of a conjurer, and his&#xD;
sudden supernatural appearance; as supernatural&#xD;
indeed it was to him, whose fear had swallowed up&#xD;
his senses.&#xD;
"And pray, sir," said John Audley, as they were&#xD;
jogging on together, "what may your name be ?"&#xD;
"Andrew Errant." "And where be you going to-&#xD;
night ?" "As far as your house, friend; where, with&#xD;
your lea're, I intend to sup and sleep." John And-&#xD;
ley's pulse again began to quicken; he was afraid to&#xD;
say yes, but still more afraid to say no: he would&#xD;
have told a lie, and said he had neither meat nor&#xD;
bed, had he not thought the conjurer knew to the&#xD;
contr~iry, 'and would take some desperate revenge:&#xD;
at last he stammered out, "Yo-you-your worship&#xD;
shall be very welcome."&#xD;
Mr. Errant was a very communicative person;&#xD;
and, as they walked along, informed his companion,&#xD;
that he was of a merry, happy temper, loved ram-&#xD;
bling, hated employment, and was blessed with a&#xD;
quick imagination, and a good memory, by means of&#xD;
which he contrived to live; in short, that he was, by&#xD;
trade, a story-teller; a trade formerly in great re-&#xD;
quest, but now grown obsolete, he being the only&#xD;
one who at present lived by it professionally; not&#xD;
one word of which John Audley believed. Mr. Er-&#xD;
rant added, that whether it was for the want of ri-&#xD;
vals, or his own excellence, he could not absolutely&#xD;
determine; but that he had been very successful in&#xD;
his attempts, and that he never visited a family a&#xD;
second time who were not very glad to see him, and&#xD;
who did not make a little feast to entertain him when-&#xD;
ever he called. John Audley understood by this,&#xD;
that the conjurer loved good eating ~and drinking;&#xD;
and for once he was not mistaken.&#xD;

that the faculty he had of suiting his history to his&#xD;

ghost~ and so I warrant is your good wife," John&#xD;
A~idley blessed himself, "How well he knows mi~&#xD;
~name! (He had forgot that he hiipself had told it.)&#xD;
lie knows I have a wife too, and knows-he knows&#xD;
every .1 hing!" Such were John's silent cogitations,&#xD;
when they arrived at his cottage.&#xD;
John Audley'y dwelling was snug, well thatched.&#xD;
arl(i warm; the inside was decorated with shelves, on&#xD;
which the white and well-scoured wooden dishes&#xD;
and treuchers were placed in rows: beneath which&#xD;
Were pasted King Charles's Golden Rules, Death&#xD;
arid the Lady, with various miraculous l)istories of&#xD;
angels that appeared in white robes to ministers of'&#xD;
the gospel, and devils that carEied away perjured&#xD;
lovers, Sabbath-breakers, and blasphemers, in flashes&#xD;
of fire, to the astonishment and terror of all be-&#xD;
holders.&#xD;
John Audley opened his door, winked to his&#xD;
wife Dorothy with signifi5ant terror, and told her&#xD;
he had brought honie a very honest gentleman, to&#xD;
give him a bed for the night, and a bit of such meat&#xD;
as she had in the house. Dorothy, who was pot in&#xD;
the habit of paying implicit obedience to her hus-&#xD;
band's mandates, was going to put in a caveat; and&#xD;
John, who knew by her physiognomy she would not&#xD;
be very nice in her choice of words, sidled up to her&#xD;
and whispered in her ear, "Hold thyfoolish tongue;&#xD;
do not be curst- 'tis a conjurer !" Do~'othy had al-.&#xD;
most as great respect for, or rather fear of conjurers,&#xD;
as John Audley himself; her countenance changed,&#xD;
she dropt a curtsey, placed a stool, cast a look at the&#xD;
cap and the (iO~, trembled, and desired the gentle.&#xD;

man would sit down, and drew her countenance into&#xD;
a demure form.&#xD;
"Thou.hadst better kill the young cock, and boil&#xD;
him with a bit of bacon," said John. " I will," re-&#xD;
plied Dorothy, and went about it, though it grieved&#xD;
her to the heart-she could have sold him for nine-&#xD;
1)ence at Prescot market.&#xD;
She presently returned with the victim in her&#xD;
~and, telling John Audley, as she entered, with an&#xD;
expressive look and emphasis, that she had not the&#xD;
least difficulty in catching him, but that, on the con-&#xD;
trary, he had flown into her arms.&#xD;
Although the talkative and frank disposition of&#xD;
Mr. Errant was some relief to the awakened fears&#xD;
of John and Dorothy, it could not make them totally&#xD;
subside; and as fear is nearly related to cunning, it&#xD;
inspired John with a thought, which he imagined&#xD;
would act like a charm in his favour, supposing the&#xD;
conjurer should be inclined to be mischievomXs, which,&#xD;
from the nature of such animals, he believed to be&#xD;
exceedingly probable. This was no other, than to&#xD;
reach down the bible, and sit upon it; which John&#xD;
Audley effected with great slyness and dexterity.&#xD;
We have before remarked, that John was of the gen-&#xD;
tie craft' ~tnd it is here necessary to observe, that&#xD;
there was a ball of shoemakers' wax, which by ac-&#xD;
cident had been laid upon the bible, over which, be-&#xD;
ing near the fire, it had spread; and this, in his&#xD;
anxiety to cheat the devil, or (which is much the&#xD;
same) the conjurer, John Audleyliad never noticed,&#xD;
but placed it under next his breech, which being&#xD;
thus in contact with the bible, he hoped might secure&#xD;
his body against the power of magic.&#xD;
Mr. Errant, whose profession in some measure im-&#xD;
plied a ready wit, and a certain knowledge of the&#xD;
heart, observed the workingg of that powerful sorce-&#xD;
ress Fancy upon the spirits of John and Dorothy,&#xD;
and determined to convert it to his own amusement.&#xD;
"I willtell you the story of the Bleeding Finger,&#xD;
good folks," said he; "it is very strange, and very~&#xD;

true: it ~iilI divert u~ while the pot is bojlino&#xD;
~, and I&#xD;
dare say von will like to hear it."&#xD;
'lthere Iive~ a magician in days of old, who had&#xD;
power over the winds and waves; whose word could&#xD;
command the demons of the deep, and the spirits of&#xD;
the ajr durst not disobey his will. This magician&#xD;
was held to be a sociable, merry, good sort of person&#xD;
when pleased~ considering he was a magician; for,&#xD;
you must understand, conjurers, wizards, necro-&#xD;
mancers, and magicians, are very tetchy and re-&#xD;
vengeful, and never fail to send their imps and gob~&#xD;
hns, to torment such as affront or use them disre-.&#xD;
spectfully.&#xD;
"The name of this magician was Tom ogorod,&#xD;
which signifies Eat him-up; and he had a daughter,&#xD;
called Holakaree, that is to say, Blood-sucker, who&#xD;
was an enchantress. 'Wheneyer either of them went&#xD;
abroad, they had at least one spirit to attend them,&#xD;
who was sometimes disguised in the form of a bear,&#xD;
at others in a monkey or cat, and sometimes in th~&#xD;
likeness of a huge mastiff; mostly, for expeditiorrs&#xD;
sake, they travelled through the air, and then they&#xD;
were usually drawn hy four flaming torches, follow-&#xD;
ed by fiends in the shape of tadpoles, who were so&#xD;
numerous that their swarms darkened the air.&#xD;
"Tomogorod, as I have said, was not much in-&#xD;
clined to mischief, unless provoked; but i\~oe be to&#xD;
any one that affronted him! If he asked a clownish&#xD;
fellow where he was going, and the lout returned a&#xD;
saucy answer, he would fix him astride upon the&#xD;
next stile without the power of moving, or turn him&#xD;
into a pitchfork, and give him his own shape again&#xD;
when any body had stuck him up to the hilts in a&#xD;
dunghill. His name denoted him to be a lover Oa&#xD;
gqod living, and he always behaved civilly to such as&#xD;
gave him the best they had to eat.&#xD;
"Holakree, his daughter, who was of an ambitious&#xD;
temper, had the wickedness to fall in love with the&#xD;
king's son, a youth of three and twenty, of a sweet&#xD;
disposition. and the most charming person in the&#xD;
198&#xD;
&#xD;
world. His name was Dulimond, which means Dim-&#xD;
j)leface, and he was the sole heir to the crown. It&#xD;
happened one day, while he was hunting, that he&#xD;
saw the most beautiful blue hare run by him that&#xD;
eyes had ever beheld, ~nd he was so charmed with&#xD;
the appearance of that strange animalthat he could&#xD;
not fbrbear leaving his other sport to follow this new&#xD;
game. He l)resently lost sight of his courtiers and&#xD;
attendants; who, as people often are, were more in-&#xD;
tent Ul)Ofl their diversion than their duty.&#xD;
"He followed the animal for more than half an&#xD;
hour; and being mounted upon a swift Arabian&#xD;
courser, seemed every instant to be within a hair's~&#xD;
breadth of catching her; when presently his eye was&#xD;
attracted, by the descent of an eaglethat darted upon&#xD;
the hare, and rose with an incredible swiftness, till&#xD;
they were both lost in the clouds. WThile theprince&#xD;
stood gazing, and looking after the eagle~ and her&#xD;
prey, which still remained like a speck upon his&#xD;
sight, the sky began to lower, the heavens darkened,&#xD;
and the distant thunders rolled. The prince looked&#xD;
round, but saw neither place of refuge nor human&#xD;
being. The storm increased; the elements, with&#xD;
dreadful bursts, seemed to crack and 5j)lit over his&#xD;
very head; and the fires of the firmament darted&#xD;
their forked and penetrating essence into the torn&#xD;
bosom of the earth. But what astonished him most&#xD;
was, that though the waters appeared to stream from&#xD;
the heavens on every side of hmmb not a hair of his&#xD;
head, nor a thread of his garments, were wet. The&#xD;
heart of Dulimond was as the heart of a lion; he was&#xD;
awed, but not dismayed.&#xD;
C~ ~ his eyes were endeavouring to trace the&#xD;
uncertain path of the life-snatching lightning, and&#xD;
his ears filled with the terrific tumults of the sky, he&#xD;
beheld, not far above him, a bright cloud, that seem-&#xD;
ed in the centre to be a lambent flame, and whence~&#xD;
issued a voice loud and impulsive, but sweet as mu-&#xD;
sic in dreams, which pronounced distinctly the fol-&#xD;
lowing words:&#xD;

"'Beware of her with a Golden Thumb.&#xD;
Follow the Bleeding Finger.&#xD;
Plunge, fearless, into the Lake of Bitterness,&#xD;
to recover the white wand of Orophalis.&#xD;
Dangers encompass you: be' virtuous, bold,&#xD;
and obedient; or you perish.'&#xD;
"The voice ceased, and the rain, and the thun-&#xD;
der, and the lightning, were no more; the sun was&#xD;
resplendent, the forest had vanished, and the scene&#xD;
was changed. Vallies of a thousand different re-&#xD;
viving shades of green were seen on every side; aro-&#xD;
inatic shrubs, flowers, and various trees, were scat-&#xD;
tered round, and distant lakes, and more distant&#xD;
mountains were in view.&#xD;
"'I'he prince, filled with wonder at all these&#xD;
strange 'accidents, was sunk deep in reflection; Inso-&#xD;
mach, that his eyes were fixed, and his soul absorbed&#xD;
by the cogitations of his mind; when he was awaken-&#xD;
ed from his trance by the voice of a lady, who sweet-&#xD;
hr and courteously demanded, if he could direct her&#xD;
to the palace of the Seven Dragons. Dulimond&#xD;
started, looked up, and was again fixed in astonish-&#xD;
inent. Never before had he beheld such perfec-&#xD;
tions, such grace, such features! Seated upon a&#xD;
milk-white courser, with hair that descended in wav-&#xD;
ing ringlets upon her horse's back, and a face more&#xD;
beauteous than the, face of nature at the Sun's rising,&#xD;
this lady looked like a spirit of heaven, and not an&#xD;
inhabitant of earth. She was obliged to repeat her&#xD;
question; and the prince, respectfully bowing, an-&#xD;
swere(l4ie never before had heard of such a l)alace.&#xD;
The lady gracefully inclined her head in token of&#xD;
thanks, and passed swiftly forward; while th~ prince,&#xD;
ravished with the angelic apparition, gave his steed&#xD;
the rein, kept within sight of her, and forgot the&#xD;
scenes that had so lately happened.&#xD;
"They rode that way for more than an hour at a&#xD;
hard rate, when they came to a vast forest. The&#xD;
prince, who had a piercing eye, beheld an inscrip-&#xD;

tion as he was riding by the side of the forest, and&#xD;
stopping a moment in hopes of learning some intelli-&#xD;
gence, whereby he might oblige the lady, he read-&#xD;
'This leads to the Palace of the Seven Dragons.'&#xD;
"The prince immediately put spurs to his horse,&#xD;
and, gently calling after the lady, beckoned her to&#xD;
return. She, who seemed to have slackened her&#xD;
pace when Dulimond stopped, 'presently heard, and&#xD;
obeyed. As she approached the prince, she thanked&#xD;
him with the roost winning words and action; whilst&#xD;
he, ravished with her charms and condescension,&#xD;
~ ayed to be admitted to escort her to the palace.&#xD;
'1' he lady again gave a courteous reply, anti they en-&#xD;
tered the forest together. They had not proceeded&#xD;
far before they lost all sight of the surrounding coun-&#xD;
try, and were buried in a ~loom so thick, that light&#xD;
could scarcely penetrate. As they rode on, strange&#xD;
noises saluted their ears; sometimes, as it were, the&#xD;
faint groaning of the dying; at others, the fierce&#xD;
cowlings of wild beasts in torture; and then again&#xD;
like the whizzing of sky-rockets, accompanied with&#xD;
loud, confused, and in numerable shrieks a~nd screams,&#xD;
as though the spirits of the air were battling till the&#xD;
very elements were tormented. Visions, as strange&#xD;
as the sounds t1~ey heard, likewise molested their&#xD;
journey: at one instant, a head without a bpdy would&#xD;
seem to dance backward he fore them, sometimes with&#xD;
ghastly looks, and sometimes with grimaces, mewing&#xD;
at them; at another, serpents, the bodies of which&#xD;
were black, their eyes flaming, and their ~tails triply&#xD;
divided, with a sting at the end of each, seemed to&#xD;
threaten the travellers: but, what was iiiore reniark-&#xD;
able, an urchin, that lay in the path at the entrance&#xD;
of the forest, became a hall of fire, and rolled itself&#xD;
along before the in, as if to direct them in the i'oute&#xD;
they should pursue.&#xD;
"Dulimond was not more astonished at these&#xD;
things than at the behaviour of the lady, who con-&#xD;
tinued her way undismayed, and almost without&#xD;
noticirg such strange events, notwithstanding that&#xD;

the demons (for the forest was enchanted) became&#xD;
more dreadfully terrible in their howls and shrieks,&#xD;
and unnatural shapes, the farther they proceeded.&#xD;
however, if a lady had the courage to go on, it was&#xD;
not for Dulimond to recede! It almost appeared&#xD;
unmanly to draw his sabre; but from doing this it&#xD;
was sc~.rcely possible to refrain, so fearfully were&#xD;
they beset. Nor could the dangers to which they&#xD;
were exposed hinder the prince from thin king on his&#xD;
most beautiful companion with rapture. her de-&#xD;
meanour, her form, her wit, and her fortitude, made&#xD;
him consider her as a miracle; and he found his af-&#xD;
fections so totally enslaved as to be absolutely irre-&#xD;
trievable. How could he forbear to admire, when&#xD;
he heard her oxily utter some short exclamation at&#xD;
the moment that the fiends were most horrible ~nd&#xD;
insolent, and when he saw her turn and smile with&#xD;
ineffable sweetness upon him, as it were to wi~h him&#xD;
notto fear or suffer on her account? This he es-&#xD;
teemed a noble generosity of soul; and he could not&#xD;
but adore her who was capable of such heroic ex-&#xD;
ertion.&#xD;
"They came at length to the other 5i(le of the&#xD;
forest; and the urchin of fire that accompanied them&#xD;
bounded from the earth, and gambolled in the air&#xD;
with a thousand antic motions. Instead, however, of&#xD;
an open country, they beheld a black rock, the front&#xD;
of which extended farther than sight, andits summit&#xD;
lay beyond the clouds. As they approached it, they&#xD;
read in huge transparent characters,&#xD;
"'This is the entrance to the Palace of the Seven&#xD;
Dragons.'&#xD;
"'How,' cried Dulimond, 'this the entrance!&#xD;
Here is no entrance; this is a vast and solid rock; ~a&#xD;
rock of marble; and all the powers of nature can-&#xD;
not enter here!'&#xD;
"The lady smiled, alighted nimbly from her horse,&#xD;
approached the place of~t he inscription, and stretch-&#xD;
ed forth her arm. She laid her t4urnb, her Golden&#xD;
202&#xD;
&#xD;
Thumb, upon the marble, when instantaneous thun-&#xD;
der rolled, and the massy front of the rock opened.&#xD;
"Imagine what was the astonishment ofDulimond,&#xD;
and what his grief, when he beheld this miracle per-&#xD;
formed by the Lady with the Golden Thumb! his&#xD;
heart sunk in his bosom, and his arm fell nerveless&#xD;
by his side. Yet this Was no time for despondency;&#xD;
danger was before him, behind him, and on every&#xD;
side of him; and the crisis of his fate drew on.&#xD;
"The chasm of the rock had remained open some&#xD;
minutes, the prince stood plunged in sorrowful sus-&#xD;
pense, and the lady seemed attending on his coming.&#xD;
A voice proclaimed-&#xD;
"'Let not such as would enter the Palace of the&#xD;
Seven Dragons linger, for the Rock of Sculls is about&#xD;
to close.'&#xD;
"At the same moment Dulimond beheld a naked&#xD;
arm, with the fore-finger slowly dropping blood, and&#xD;
pointing the way to the palace of the Seven Dragons.&#xD;
The vision, though horrible, gave him pleasure; his&#xD;
heart was with the lady; and he rejoiced that his&#xD;
duty furnished him with an excuse to follow his in-&#xD;
clinations.&#xD;
"The prince had but just time to make the pas~&#xD;
sage of the rock before it shut; and had he been a&#xD;
moment later, it would have closed upon him; which&#xD;
accident happening to many, it was called the Rock&#xD;
of Sculls. They proceeded onward till they came&#xD;
to a bridge, where lay the Seven Dragons, whence&#xD;
the palace derived its~ name. At their approach, all&#xD;
these horrible monsters lashed their prodigious tails,&#xD;
opened their destructive jaws (set all over with teeth&#xD;
like harrows,) and projected their long and forked&#xD;
tongues; and, with an insatiate fury, were flying&#xD;
upon Dulimond. Mortal resistance to such enemies&#xD;
seemed vain, and death inevitable; when, at the&#xD;
very instant they were about to seize on the prince,&#xD;
the lady held forth the Golden Thumb, and they&#xD;
dropped senseless to the earth in a profound sleep.&#xD;

"They passed the bridge, and drew near to the&#xD;
palace, which was the most superb that eyes ever&#xD;
beheld. Its magnitude and architecture filled the&#xD;
mind with grandeur, and the richifess of its oriia-&#xD;
ments dazzled the sight to behold. They came at&#xD;
last to a place where the road divided; one way went&#xD;
directly forward, and the other deviated to the left,&#xD;
which led to the palace. On the confines of the lat-&#xD;
ter StOO(l trool)s of nymphs, whom none could equal&#xD;
in beauty, the Lady with the Golden Thumb alone&#xD;
excepted, and such as imagination only has seen.&#xD;
Some of them played on instruments, the sound of&#xD;
which ravished the ear; others danced with such de-&#xD;
ligbtful motion, as put mortal senses into a delirium&#xD;
of pleasure. They were come to meet the lady and&#xD;
i~t'ince, and this way were they proceeding, when&#xD;
Dulimond beheld the Bleeding Finger point the&#xD;
contrary road. He stopped, he looked, he consider-&#xD;
ed, his bosom heaved a profound sigh, the war within&#xD;
him was strong, and his body was motionless. The.&#xD;
lady did not persuade him by words, she took a more&#xD;
powerful method; her looks, sorrowful and dejected;&#xD;
her eyes, with all the well-feigned grief of poverty,&#xD;
told him, that in him was all her happiness centered;&#xD;
with him she should be blessed; without bin-i misera-&#xD;
ble. Neither did she remind him of the dangers to&#xD;
Which he had been exposed, and' from which he had&#xD;
been preserved by her; therefore Dulimond remeni-&#xD;
bered them the more forcibly. His heart was en-&#xD;
slaved by her.beauty, he could no longer resist her&#xD;
charms~ and again he began to follow her; when the&#xD;
air was filled with the most doleful wailings, and&#xD;
the finger of the naked arm began to stream 111th&#xD;
blood.&#xD;
"The hearLof Dulimond was strongly virtuous:&#xD;
he had been nurtured in a sublime morality. The re~&#xD;
merubrance of the firm resolutions he had so often&#xD;
made, to persevere amidst all temptations in the&#xD;
paths of rectitude and honour, came with a gleam of&#xD;
heroic ardour upon his mind, elevated his soul, and&#xD;
~04&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
made it equal to the glorious contest. He turned&#xD;
his eyes from the wit series oC passion and pleasure,&#xD;
and, with a determine d spirit, followed the naked&#xD;
arm: the blood again more slowly dropped; but the&#xD;
vast concave of the sky became tortured with shrieks,&#xD;
cries, howlings, so piercing, that distraction would&#xD;
have seized any one of less virtue and courage than&#xD;
D ulimond.&#xD;
"Undaunted did he follow his bleeding guide,&#xD;
though the fiends now transformed themselves into&#xD;
ten thousand hideous shapes, and chattered at, in-&#xD;
suited, and assaulted him, with a hundred-fold more&#xD;
malignity and fury than they did in his passage&#xD;
through the Enchanted Forest. He came at length&#xD;
to the Lake of Bitterness; but who can describe the&#xD;
dreadful, horrible, and disgusti~Thuimals, by which&#xD;
its waters were guarded! On the surface, vipers,&#xD;
water-snakes, and dun-coloured serpents, hissed ter-&#xD;
ror with their forked tongues. At the border lay&#xD;
toads, with starting eyes and vast bloated bodies;&#xD;
their mouths just above the water, diving sometimes&#xD;
beneath the slimy sedge, while the lake bubbled&#xD;
poison, and again ascending to the water's edge.&#xD;
The bottom was covered over with lizzards, newts,&#xD;
and efts, darting upon their prey; reptiles, with&#xD;
51)eckled bellies and a hundred legs, that shot swift&#xD;
as an arrow from a bow, whither their voracity or&#xD;
malice willed; and spiders, so huge and inflated, that&#xD;
the shagged hai~r of their bodies was like the bristles&#xD;
of the hunted boar; and their eyes, globular and&#xD;
projecting, were as the eyes of tigers watching whom&#xD;
they might devour.&#xD;
"All these, and innumerable others fpr which na-&#xD;
ture has no likeness, immediately on the approach of&#xD;
Dulimond, ceased their obscene sports, and rancor-&#xD;
ous wars on one another, and with their million of&#xD;
mouths, caine in voracious swarms, as if in expecta-&#xD;
tion of their prey. Humanity shuddered, and shrunk:&#xD;
it was a sight of horror.&#xD;

the centre of' the lake, the finger ceased to bleed, and&#xD;
pointed downward. Thither the prince cast his eye,&#xD;
and beheld the white wand of Orophalis; he stayed&#xD;
not to consider on the danger, but quitted his steed,&#xD;
and threw himself, fearless, into the Lake of Bitter~&#xD;
ness. His arm divided the waters; and though his&#xD;
body seemed to be penetrated and torn by a host of&#xD;
these devouring reptiles, he still had the power to&#xD;
proceed. He arrived at the spot; and, unterrified,&#xD;
plunged to the bottom. The earth shook, the heavens&#xD;
were on fire, and nature seemed to groan as though&#xD;
her end was come. He seized the wand; and, lo!&#xD;
the lake was no more! He stood upon dry land, his&#xD;
enemies were annihilated, and himself unhurt.&#xD;
"While he stood considering these things, he&#xD;
heard a sound of a multitude singing 'Praises to the&#xD;
valorous Prince Dulimond, who hath broken the&#xD;
charms of Hell, and hath delivered us from the spells&#xD;
of Holakaree. He turned and saw coming towards&#xD;
him troops of knights and ladies, and at their head&#xD;
a venerable old man, leading, as he thought, the La..&#xD;
dy of the Golden Thumb.&#xD;
"'Fear not, valorous prince,' said the aged knight&#xD;
'your trials are past, and your reward is come: this&#xD;
virgin is no enchantress.'&#xD;
"'rhe happiness of Dulimond was extreme, when&#xD;
tie was informed that Holakaree had assumed the&#xD;
beautiful form of Bellimante; that the vile enchant-&#xD;
ress was now no more: that his valour and virtue&#xD;
had freed the most angelic princess of the universe,&#xD;
her father, and many other noble knights and ladies,&#xD;
who had fallen into her snares.' In his transport, he&#xD;
cast himself at Bellimante's feet, and kissed her vir-&#xD;
gin hand, which he was in ecstasy to find was not&#xD;
now stigmatized by the Golden Thumb.&#xD;
"As for the magician Tomogorod, he became dis-&#xD;

one faithful demon, that assists him in his wants, and&#xD;

"So ends the tale of the Bleeding Finger."&#xD;
It is easy to imagine, what effect a story like this&#xD;
would have upon John Audley and his dame Doro-&#xD;
thy. Had not Mr. Errant, who was still attentive to&#xD;
the supper, occasionally interrupted his narrative,&#xD;
to remind his hostess of the pot's boiling, the cock&#xD;
and bacon might have cooked themselves for Doro-~&#xD;
thy. Blue hares, bleeding fingers, enchanted forests,&#xD;
and the rest of the machinery, were things so amaz-&#xD;
ing, so new, and so true to them, that gaping asto-&#xD;
nishment, terror, and agitation, possess dt hem whol.-&#xD;
ly. And though our narrator could not so far de..&#xD;
grade his subject as to lower his language to their&#xD;
exact scale of comprehen~ion, yet his fine words, and&#xD;
figurative expressions gave, even at the fire-side of&#xD;
John Atidley, a certain dignity to hi~ subject that&#xD;
made it more wonderful.&#xD;
It may be observed too, with what art Mr. Errant&#xD;
threw in his touches, which, though in themselves&#xD;
foreign, and of a heterogeneous nature to the sub..&#xD;
ject, served his purpose. Thus, though the magician&#xD;
was a character inconsistent with and superfluous to&#xD;
the tale, he was not so to Mr. Errant. The insinua-.&#xD;
tion, that he was attended by the devil in the shape&#xD;
of a dog, was not lost upon .lohn Audley; and the&#xD;
concluding sentence, that again revived this circum-&#xD;
stance in his memory, had its due weight. In short,&#xD;
John's imagination had been led such a dance, and&#xD;
was so much disturbed, that he could not be said pre-&#xD;
cisely to know, if he was sitting in a cottage, or in&#xD;
an enchanted castle.&#xD;
Mr. Errant had observed the incident of the bible,&#xD;
as well as the wax that was attached to it; and,&#xD;
waving his walking-stick in a circular and grave&#xD;
manner, touched it, and demanded of John what it&#xD;
was he had under him. John, who doubted whether&#xD;
the stick was a stick, or the wand of Orophalis, re-&#xD;
plied, with a trembling voice-" The-the-the bi~bible&#xD;

bible-or are you sure it is actually there?" "I-I&#xD;
believe so, sir." "Be so good as to rise and let rue&#xD;
see." John trembled, rose, and looked, hut no bible&#xD;
was there.-His hair would have lifted his hat off,&#xD;
had it been on.~-~-" The Lord of heaven bless me&#xD;
said John.-" Christ have mercy upon me !" ~v~Arhat&#xD;

clapped his hand behind, and ejaculated-" The&#xD;
Lord pardon me, miserable sinner; I am bewitch-&#xD;

~John's distress: it was truly ludicrous. John And-&#xD;
Icy was fully convinced he was now more firmly&#xD;
married to the bible than ever he had been to Doro-&#xD;
thy herself; nay, and strange as it may seem, he&#xD;
thought the last the worst match of the two. To&#xD;
carry such a wen for life was not to be supported.&#xD;
John fill on his knees,-" I pray and beseech you,&#xD;
for the love of I-leaven's mercy, almighty. goodness,&#xD;
and gr~ce, Mr. Conjurer. have pity on inc-I am a&#xD;
poor, innocent man; I never meant to offend your&#xD;
wor-shi~'s goodness; indeed, indeed, I never did !"&#xD;
John did not perform his part solus; Dorothyprayed&#xD;
as fast as he; and Mr. Errant, as soon as he could&#xD;
for laughing, desired John to rise, and he would dis-&#xD;
enchant him; which office he kindly and faithfully&#xD;
performed: and, after a few consolitory sentences,&#xD;
which Mr. Errant knew p~erfcctly well how to a(lapt,&#xD;
he prevailed on his simple, but kind hosts, to prepare&#xD;
for supper.&#xD;
Had it not been for that powerful and universal&#xD;
disturbed, Fear, it wouhf have been difficult to have&#xD;
found, in a like number of persons, a more happy&#xD;
fire-side, or one round which there was more true&#xD;
content, and native simplicity of heart. Even this&#xD;
very fear had something of pleasure in it, and some-\&#xD;
thing enviable. It was a delirium of the soul, to be&#xD;
at supper with an enchanter; to see a demon, in the&#xD;
form of a dog, fixing his eyes upon them; and to sup-&#xD;
pose that, if the mighty conjurer pleased, he could&#xD;

rp~ present occasion could not fail to recall to&#xD;
the imagination of John And Icy his own adventures&#xD;
with the ghosts, and the stories he had heard others&#xD;
relate. "An't please you," said John to Mr. Er-&#xD;
~ "did you ever see the Shrieking Woman ?"&#xD;
"No." " No! now I have seen her three times."&#xD;
" And pray what kind of a lady is she?" " Why,&#xD;
I'll tell- your honour. As I wur walking home one&#xD;
night from Thomas O'Wilkins's, (I remember Dame&#xD;
Dickinson had (hat very night been telling us a mod&#xD;
of tales about ghosts) and so as I wur turning the&#xD;
corner of Roger Fairley's barn, I saw, what I theui&#xD;
thought to be a huge black cat; and so it run towards&#xD;
the barn-door, and vanished. So, upon seeing it&#xD;
vanish, I begun to bethink me; and, to tell you truth,&#xD;
I wur almost afraid to go by the door where the huge&#xD;
black cat vanished. So I stood still a bit to con~&#xD;
sider; and, as sure as you are alive, I thought I smelt&#xD;
a smell o' brimstone. So, to tell you the truth, I be-&#xD;
gan to be mortagiously frightened and afraid! and&#xD;
so, as I wur standing there, I heard the most wound&#xD;
ui)roar, arid speaking and squalling, and scampering,&#xD;
in the barn, that ever I heard sin' the hour I wur&#xD;
born. So I bethought me, that this barn wur cer-&#xD;
tainly a meeting place for witches and wizards;&#xD;
and, what made it more likely, it wur Saturday&#xD;
night, and the wind had just then began to blow as&#xD;
thof heaven and earth would come together; so that,&#xD;
what with the noise within and the noise without,&#xD;
you never in all your life heard such a deadly din:&#xD;

MARVELLOUS REPOSITOR'f.                              THE BLEEDING FINGER.&#xD;
&#xD;
I stood, quite in a sound, and could neither stir foot&#xD;
backward nor forward; and in a deadly taking, to&#xD;
be sure, I wur, as you may well think: for you must&#xD;
know, it came into my mind, that they might drag&#xD;
me into the barn, and make a wizard o' me, wheth'-&#xD;
er I would or no; nay, and I do assure you, I saw an&#xD;
iml), in the very exact form of a rat, that came out&#xD;
of the barn, and ran toward me, as fierce as thof it&#xD;
xvur resolute to seize upon me: but, as Heaven would&#xD;
have it, I started, and cried, 'God bless me!' and it&#xD;
vanished. Well; and so as I wur tendingg there,&#xD;
with my eye fixed upon the barn-door, for 1 durst no'&#xD;
venture to turn my head the least in the world to&#xD;
the right or to the left, all at once there war a dead&#xD;
cold hand clapt to my cheek, and something at the&#xD;
same time gave me such a whang on the back, that&#xD;
down I fell, and I really thought there war an end o'&#xD;
roe. But, however, for once it seems I war more&#xD;
frightened than hurt, as I found afterwards, when&#xD;
Dick 'Walter, or Dick Dare-devil, as he is called in&#xD;
our parish, gave me his hand, and helped me up.&#xD;
You may be sure, I war not, a little pleased; so I&#xD;
told him the whole story of the Black Cat and the&#xD;
clattering, and the devil's imp running at me to&#xD;
make a wizard o' me, and all; and so he pretended&#xD;
to laugh at me, and not to believe me, and not to put&#xD;
no faith in such things; but that, as you may, sup-&#xD;
pose, was all pretence, for I am certain every body&#xD;
knows there is such things; because, why, does not&#xD;
the bible tell us so? But Dick had a mind' to seem&#xD;
fasheous, and fear nothing; though, to be sure, Dick&#xD;
is as bold as a lion, and as strong as a horse, and&#xD;
there is not a man in Lancashire dare to face him&#xD;
fairly; but then, to be sure, he is deadly wicked and&#xD;
profane; and I have heard him challenge Old Nick,&#xD;
if he durst appear. And so I was so pleased to find&#xD;
Dick, that I would take him down to Hal's at the&#xD;
bottom of the hill, and gi' him a mug of ale. So&#xD;
away we went; and when we came there, we found&#xD;
Wil Tipler, the drunken shoemaker, along xvi' Farm-&#xD;
210&#xD;
&#xD;
LV&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
er U plon's tall Tom, who is six foot seven inches and&#xD;
a half without his shoes; and so Dick would be a pint&#xD;
to my pint; and Will he war another; and Tom war&#xD;
another; and go on, till we made it very late; and so&#xD;
you must know, my road home from Hal's lay over&#xD;
(he stile and gate, where the Shrieking Woman com-&#xD;
monly sits; but, you must know, by this time I had&#xD;
got a drop in my head, and then, somehow or anoth-&#xD;
ei', when one's in company wi' Dick, one never fears&#xD;
nothing; and he is such a good-natured fellow too,&#xD;
when nobody puts upon him, for he won't suffer no&#xD;
man to fash and affront any man that he is in corn-&#xD;
~xny xvi'; so, as I tell you, 1 had to go over the&#xD;
Shrieking Woman's stile; so as I did no' half like it,&#xD;
but war got pot-valiant, and would no' ask Dick to&#xD;
go xvi' me, for I knew he'd game and laugh at me.&#xD;
So away I set; and so, as I told you, a deadly windy&#xD;
night it w ur; so, as sure as can be, when I had got a&#xD;
bit from the house, I began to feel a forethought, and&#xD;
to be partly sure that I should see her, and the far-&#xD;
ther I went, the more I war certain; and so I began&#xD;
heartily to wish I had got Dick or some one to come&#xD;
wi' me: bat that was all over; so away I went wi'&#xD;
my heart in my mouth, as I may say, and I wish&#xD;
I may be hanged if my hair did not stand an end&#xD;
every now and then wi' thinking on't. Well; so as&#xD;
I tell you, I kept going my gait a thisen till I came&#xD;
almost wi' my nose upon the stile ; but I should have&#xD;
told you, it war most mortagious dark, for the moon&#xD;
war gone down, and the night war as black as pitch.&#xD;
I believe in my heart the heavens never sent out or&#xD;
saw a more murky welkin: The sky war like a bag&#xD;
of soot. So, as I tell you, I had got Wi' my very nose&#xD;
almost upon the stile, when all of a sudden I saw her&#xD;
rise from l)ehind the hedge, as it were, and place&#xD;
herself upon the stile. Lord! how my knees knock-&#xD;
ed together! At first I had not the power to move&#xD;
hand or limb; and [do think I stood for some min-&#xD;
utes, with no more life in me than an oyster; am&#xD;
then, when I came a little to myself, my teeth chat-&#xD;

tered, and I dithered as thof I had been in an agiie.&#xD;
so what to do I (lid na know, for if I turned back she&#xD;
would walk before me. So I bethought me it Wur&#xD;
best to put my trust in my maker, and to say the&#xD;
Lord's prayer, and so go a bit lower down along the&#xD;
hedge, where there war a gate, Well, will you be-&#xD;
lieve me, as sure as I sit on this stool, ~when I came&#xD;
to the gate, ther~ war she again. 'The Lord or&#xD;
heaven's goodness deliver me,' thought I, 'what will&#xD;
become o' me!' And so, do you know, all the sins&#xD;
that ever I had committed began to come into my&#xD;
head. I bethought me o' the five apples I had stoleii&#xD;
when I went to school with old Dame Trott o' Pres~&#xD;
cot; and of the bastard I had by haif-witted Mall o'&#xD;
the Hill, before I war four and twenty; and o' the&#xD;
rohin-redbreast I shot instead of a crow; and the&#xD;
~lver groat that I found the first year I was made&#xD;
clerk o' this parish, which I wickedly spent at the&#xD;
fair instead of giving notice on't at the church-door,&#xD;
a.~ I ought to have done; and moreover, of haVing&#xD;
the very Sunday before fallen asleep in sarmunt&#xD;
tiaie, and what war worser, when his reverence, the&#xD;
vicar, wur in the pulpit, and not the curate; which&#xD;
his reverence afterwards told me, in the Vestry, war&#xD;
breaking the commandments, and an abomination to&#xD;
the Lord. So, as I tell you, I began to pray to the&#xD;
gracious providence of marcy, for deliverance and&#xD;
forgiveness pf my sins; for, to be sure, as I have told&#xD;
you, a wicked sinner I had been; so, while as I wur&#xD;
here, in this most dismal and terrible astoundifica-&#xD;
tion, some how or another, I found she war vanished&#xD;
and disappeared, and wur gone; so I then fell upon&#xD;
my knees, and thanked the grace of heavenly good-&#xD;
ness, and the Lord of Hosts, and the Almighty Maker&#xD;
of heaven and earth, and the God of Israel, for all hi~&#xD;
manifold merciful loving kindness to me, a poor&#xD;
wicked and unworthy sinner; and so I begun to put&#xD;
my trust in him' and so, seeing as I did not see her&#xD;
any longer, I ventured by little and little toiv'rd&#xD;
the gate; and so at last I laid my hand upon't, and&#xD;

then one foot, and then t'other; and so at last I got&#xD;
o' the other side o' the hedge, .ind so I war fain to&#xD;
walk by the hedge side for fear o' losThg myself, it&#xD;
wur so mortagious dark, as [tell you; and so, as I&#xD;
wur walking along, I thought I heard a whispering&#xD;
o' t'other side o' the hedge; and I am not a christian&#xD;
soul in the land o' the living, if it wur not as like the&#xD;
whispering of men's voices as my right hand is to my&#xD;
left; and so my hair began to bristle as bad almost&#xD;
as before, and I stopt; and sowhen I stopt, the whis-&#xD;
pering vanished: but I heard a mortagious running,&#xD;
and a scampering, and a clattering o' feet, o' t'other&#xD;
side o' the hedge, which I could compare to nothing&#xD;
but a parcel of devils running a race towards the&#xD;
stile; and, for all we know well enough that spirits'&#xD;
bodies are not bodies, I'm sure they made as great a&#xD;
clattering as thof they had had legs and feet of flesh&#xD;
and blood. Well' so I war now, as I thought, o' the&#xD;
right side o' the hedge, so I kept my gait till'I came&#xD;
to the stile; and seeing as I saw nothing of her there,&#xD;
I began to have some hopes that she war gone for&#xD;
good and all; so I set forward again toward home,&#xD;
and begun to bethink me that I had got something&#xD;
to talk about as long as I lived; but will you believe&#xD;
me? I had not gone half the field's length, till I saw&#xD;
her again walking right before me! 'The Lord oi&#xD;
heavenly blessedness defend me!' thought I; ' what&#xD;
will become o' me!' I stopt, and she stopt-I took&#xD;
heart, and made two or three steps-an(l so (lid she.&#xD;
Never since I war a shiner war I in such a quanda-&#xD;
ry before! What could I do? If a man is so fear-&#xD;
ful as to turn back, I had always been told, she is so&#xD;
mischievous she will twine his neck roun(l, mayhap.&#xD;
or blight him i' the eyes, or somewhat like, as she&#xD;
struck Goody Hazel a box o' the ear, and she has&#xD;
been (leaf o' that side ever sin. So, as I said, what&#xD;
could I do? Why, I prayed to the Lord, and thought&#xD;
I would keep on my gait as long as she was that dis-&#xD;
tance before me. I should have told you, tho', she&#xD;
war all in white, or else, as you may think, I could&#xD;

na followed her far, before she began to get higher&#xD;

Mr. Errant had been much among the simple in-&#xD;

WITCHCRAFT.&#xD;
&#xD;
LORD Chief Justice Holt, who was very wild in his&#xD;
youth, was once out with some of his companions on&#xD;
a journey into the country. They had spent all&#xD;
their money, and, after many consultations what to&#xD;
do, it was resolved they should part company, and&#xD;
try their fortune separately. bit got to a public-&#xD;
house at the end of a straggling village, and putting&#xD;
a good face on the matter, ordered his horse to be&#xD;
well taken care of, called for a room, bespoke supper,&#xD;
and a bed. He then strolled into the kitchen, where&#xD;
he saw a young lass, about thirteen years of ~ge,&#xD;
shivering with an ague; he inquired of his landlady,&#xD;
a widow, who the girl was, and how long she had&#xD;
been ill. The good woman told him that she was&#xD;
her daughter, an only child, and that she had been&#xD;
ill near a year, notwithstanding all the assistance&#xD;
she could procure from physie, at an expense which&#xD;
had been almost her ruin. HoIt shook his head at&#xD;
the mentiiin of the doctors, and bade the woman be&#xD;
under no farther concern, for that her daughter&#xD;
should not have another fit. He then wrote a few&#xD;
unintelligible words, in court band, on a scrap of&#xD;
parchment, which had been the direction to an&#xD;
hamper, and rolling it up, ordered that it should be&#xD;
bound upon the girl's wrist, and remain there till&#xD;
she was well. As it happened, the ague returned&#xD;
no more, and Holt having continued there a few&#xD;
days, called for his bill with as much courage as if&#xD;
his pockets had been filled with gold. C~ Ah! God&#xD;
bless you," says the old woman, "you are nothing in&#xD;
my debt, I'm sure: I wish I was able to pay you for&#xD;
the cure you have performed upon roy daughter;&#xD;
and if I had but been fortunate enough to see you&#xD;
ten months ago, it would have saved me forty pounds&#xD;
in my pocket." Holt, after a little altercation, ac-&#xD;

cepted of his accommodation as a gratuity, and rode&#xD;
away.&#xD;
It happened that many years afterwards, when he&#xD;
was one of the justices of the King's Bench, he went&#xD;
a circuit into the same county, and among other&#xD;
criminals brought before him, was an old woman&#xD;
charged with witchcr~aft; to support which accuse&#xD;
lion, several witnesses, sii~ore that she had a spell,&#xD;
with which she could either cure such cattle as were&#xD;
sick, or destroy those that were well: in the use of&#xD;
this, they said, she had been lately detected, and it&#xD;
having been seized uponijer, was ready to be pro.&#xD;
duced in court; and the judge upon this desired that&#xD;
it might be handed up to him. It appeared to be a&#xD;
dirty ball, covered with rags, and bound many times&#xD;
round with packthread; these coverings he removed&#xD;
with great deliberation, one after another; and at&#xD;
last found a piece of parchment, which he knew to&#xD;
he the same that he had used as an expedient to sup-&#xD;
p1y his want of money. At the recollection of this&#xD;
incident he changed colour, and sat silent: at length,&#xD;
recollecting himself, he addressed the jury to this&#xD;
effect: "Gentlemen, I must now relate a particular&#xD;
of my life which very ill suits my present character,&#xD;
and the station in which I sit; but to conceal it&#xD;
would be to aggravate the folly for which I ought to&#xD;
atone, endanger innocence, and countenance su-&#xD;
perstition: this bauble, which some of you suppose&#xD;
to have the power of life and death, is a senseless&#xD;
scrawl, whieivl.wrote with my own hand, and gave&#xD;
to this woman, whomi'or no other cause, you ac-&#xD;
cuse as a witch."-He then related the circumstances&#xD;
of the transaction, and it had such an effect upon the&#xD;
minds of the people, that Judge Holt's landlady was&#xD;
the last person tried in that county for witchcraft.&#xD;

THE&#xD;
MYSTERIOUS PACK.&#xD;
&#xD;
IN the year I7~8, Colonel Ridley returned from&#xD;
India, with what, in those days, was accounted an&#xD;
immense fortune, and retired to a country seat on&#xD;
the hanks of North Tyne, in Northumberland. He&#xD;
went to London annually with his family, during a&#xD;
few of the winter months, and at these times there&#xD;
were but few left at his country house. At the time&#xD;
we treat of, there were only three domestics remain-&#xD;
ed there; a maid servant, whose name was Alice,&#xD;
kept the house, and there were besides, an old man&#xD;
and a boy, the one threshed the corn, and the other&#xD;
took care of some cattle.&#xD;
One afternoon as Alice was sitting spinning some&#xD;
yarn for a pair of stockings for herself, a peddler en-&#xD;
tered the hall with a comical pack on his back. Alice&#xD;
had seen as long a pack, and as broad a p ack; but a&#xD;
pack equally long, broad, and thick, shed declared&#xD;
she never saw. It was about the middle of winter,&#xD;
when the days were short, and the nights cold, long,&#xD;
and wearisome. The peddler was a handsome, well-&#xD;
dressed man, and very likely to be a very agreeable&#xD;
companion for such a maid as Alice, on such a night&#xD;
as that; yet Alice declared, that from the very first&#xD;
she did not like him greatly, and though he introduc-&#xD;
ed himself with a little rib al dry, and a great deal of&#xD;
flattery interlarded, yet when he came to ask a&#xD;
night's lodging, he met with a peremptory refusal;&#xD;
he jested on the subject, said he believed she was in&#xD;
the right, for that it would scarcely be safe to trust&#xD;
him under the same roof with such a sweet and beau-&#xD;
tiful creature-Alice was an old maid, and any thing&#xD;
but beautiful-He then took her on his knee, caress-&#xD;

pack before I go further.' At the mentioning of the&#xD;
shawl, the picture of deliberation was portrayed in&#xD;
lively colours on Alice's face for a little; but her&#xD;
prudence overcame. 'No, she was but a servant,&#xD;
and had orders to harbour no person about the house&#xD;

night.' 'Then you must leave them, or get a horse&#xD;
to carry them away.' 'Of all the sweet inflexible&#xD;
beings that ever were made, you certainly are the&#xD;
chief. But I cannot blame you; your resolution is&#xD;
just and right. Well, well, since no better may be,&#xD;
71 must leave them, and go search for lodgings myself&#xD;
somewhere else, for, fatigued as I am, it is as much&#xD;
as my life is worth to endeavour carrying them fur-.&#xD;
ther.' Alice was rather taken at her word: she&#xD;
wanted nothing to do with 'his goods: the man was&#xD;
displeased at her, and might accuse her of stealing&#xD;
some of them: but it was an alternative she had&#xD;
posed, and against which she could start no plausible&#xD;
objection; so she consented, though with much reluc-&#xD;
tance. 'But the pack will be better out of your&#xD;
way,' said he, 'and safer, if you will be so kind as to&#xD;
lock it by in some room or closet.' She then led him&#xD;
into a low parlour,, where he placed it carefully on&#xD;
two chairs, and went his way, wishing Alice a good&#xD;
night.&#xD;
213&#xD;
&#xD;
When old Alice and the pack were lefl together in&#xD;
the large house by themselves, she felt a kind of tin-&#xD;
defined terror come over her mind about it. 'What&#xD;
can be in it,' said she to herself, 'that makes it so&#xD;
heavy ? Surely when the man carried it this length,&#xD;
he might have carried it farther too. It is a con-&#xD;
founded queer pack; I'll go and look at it once again,&#xD;
and see what I think is in it; an(l suppose I should&#xD;
handle it all round, [may then perhaps have a good&#xD;
guess what is in it.&#xD;
Alice went cautiously and fearfully into the par-&#xD;
lour and opened a wall-press: she wanted nothingin&#xD;
the press, indeed she never looked into it, for her&#xD;
eyes were fixed on the pack, and the longer she&#xD;
looked at it, she liked it the worse; and as to hand-&#xD;
ling it, she would not have touched it for all it con-&#xD;
tained. She went again into the kitchen and, con-&#xD;
versed with herself. She thought of the man's earn-&#xD;
estness to leave it; of its monstrous shape, and every&#xD;
circumstance connected with it; they were all mys-&#xD;
terioa~, and she was convinced in her own mind,&#xD;
there was something uncanny, if not unearthly in&#xD;
the pack.&#xD;
~Vhat surmises will not fear give rise to in the&#xD;
mind of a woman! She lighted a moulded candle, and&#xD;
went again into the parlour, closed the shutters, and&#xD;
barred them; but before she came out, she set herself&#xD;
upright, held in her breath, and took another steady&#xD;
and scrutinizing lqok at the sack. God of mercy!&#xD;
She saw it moving, as visible as- she ever saw any&#xD;
thing in her life. Every hair on her head stood up-&#xD;
right. Every inch of flesh on her body crept like a&#xD;
nest of pismires. She hastened into the kitchen as&#xD;
fast as she could, for the knees bent under the terror&#xD;
that had overwhelmed the heart of poor Alice. She&#xD;
puffed out the candle, lighted it again, and, not be..&#xD;
ing able to find a candlestick, though a dozen stood&#xD;
an the shelf in the kitchen, she set it in a water-jug,&#xD;
and ran out to the barn for old Richard. 'Oh Rich-&#xD;
ard! Oh for mercy, Richard, rnakehaste, and come&#xD;

into the house. Come away Richard.' 'Why, what&#xD;
is the matter Alice? what is wrong?' 'Oh, Rich-&#xD;
ard! a peddler came into the hail entreating for lodg-&#xD;
iig. Well, I would not let him stay on any account,&#xD;
and hehold, he is gone off and left his pack.' And&#xD;
what is the great matter of that?' said Richard. 'I&#xD;
will wager a penny he will look after it, before it&#xD;
shall look after him.' 'But oh Richard, I tremble to&#xD;
tell you! We are all gone, for it is a living pack.'&#xD;
'A living pack!' said Richard, and staring at Alice,&#xD;
and letting his chops fall down. Richard had just&#xD;
lifted his flail over his head to begin threshing a&#xD;
sheaf; but when he heard of a living pack, he drop~&#xD;
ped one end of the hand-staifto the floor, and leaning&#xD;
on the other, took such a look at Alice. He knew&#xD;
long before that Alice was beautiful, he knew that&#xD;
ten years before, but ver took such a look at her in&#xD;
his life. 'A living p~t~!' said Richard. 'Why the&#xD;
woman is mad without all doubt.' 'Oh, Richard!&#xD;
come away. Heaven knows what is in it! but I saw&#xD;
itmovingas plainly aslsee you at present. Make&#xD;
haste, and come away Richard.' Richard did not&#xD;
stand to expostulate any longer, nor even to put on&#xD;
his coat, but followed Alice into the house, assuring&#xD;
her by the way, that it was nothing but a whim, and&#xD;
of a piece with many of her phantasies, 'But,'&#xD;
added he, 'of all the foolish ideas that ever possessed&#xD;
your brain, this is the most unfeasible, unnatural, and&#xD;
impossible. How can a pack, made up of napkins,&#xD;
and muslins, and cordu-r-oy breeches, perhaps, ever&#xD;
become alive? It is even worse than to suppose a&#xD;
horse's hair would turn an eel.' So saying, he lifted&#xD;
the candle out of the jug, and turning about, never&#xD;
slopped till he had his hand upon the pack. He felt&#xD;
the deals that~ surrounded its edge to prevent the&#xD;
goods being rumpled and spoiled by carrying, the&#xD;
cords that bound it, and the canvass in which it was&#xD;
wrapped. 'The pack was well enough, he found&#xD;
nought about it that other packs wanted. It was&#xD;
just like other packs made up of the same stuff. He&#xD;

saw nought that ailed it. It would cost the honest&#xD;
man ~Z0Ol. if not more. It would cost him 300 or&#xD;
3501. if the goods were fine. But he would make it&#xD;
again by cheating fools like Alice with his gewgaws.'&#xD;
Alice testified some little disappointment at seeing&#xD;
Richard unconvinced, even by ocular proof. She&#xD;
wished she had never seen him or it hoxvsomever;&#xD;
for she was convinced there was something mysteri-&#xD;
ous about it; that they were stolen goods or some-&#xD;
thing that way; and she was terrified to stay in the&#xD;
house with it. But Richard assured her that the&#xD;
pack was a right enough pack.&#xD;
During this conversation, in comes Edward. He&#xD;
wa~ a lad about sixteen years of age, son to a coal-&#xD;
(iriver on the border-was possessed of a good deal&#xD;
of humour and ingenuity, but somewhat roguish, for-&#xD;
ward, and commonly very ragged in his apparel. He&#xD;
was about this time wholly intent on shooting the&#xD;
crows and birds, that alighted in whole flocks where&#xD;
he foddered the cattle. He had bought a large old&#xD;
military gun, which he denominated Copenhagen~&#xD;
and was continually thundering away at them. He&#xD;
seldom killed any, if ever; but he once or twice&#xD;
knocked ofi' a few feathers, and after much narrow&#xD;
inspection, discovered some drops of blood on the&#xD;
snow. He was at this very moment come in great&#xD;
haste for Copenhagen, having seen a glorious chance&#xD;
of sparrows, and a Robin-red-breast among them,&#xD;
feeding on a site of a corn rick; but hearing them&#xD;
talk of something mysterious, and a living pack, he&#xD;
pricked up his ears and was all attention. 'Faith,&#xD;
Alice,' said he, 'if you will let me, I'll shoot it.'&#xD;
Hold your peace, you fool,' said Richard. Edward&#xD;
took the candle from Richard, who still held it in his&#xD;
hand, and, gliding down the passage, edged up the&#xD;
parlour door, and watched the pack attentively for&#xD;
about two minutes. He then came back with a&#xD;
spring, and with looks very different from those&#xD;
which regulated his features as he went down. As,&#xD;
sure as he had death to meet with he saw it stirring&#xD;
&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;

'Hold your peace, you fool,' said Richard. Edward&#xD;
sWore again that he saw it stirring; but whether he&#xD;
really thought so, or only said so is hard to determine.&#xD;
'Faith Alice,' said he again, 'if you will let me, I'll&#xD;
shoot it.' 'I tell you to hold your peace, you fool,'&#xD;
Said Richard. 'No,' said Edward, ~'in the multi-&#xD;
tude of counsellors there is safety; and I maintain&#xD;
this to ~e our safest plan. Oar master's house is coti-&#xD;
signed to our care, and the wealth that it contains&#xD;
may tempt some people to use stratagems. Now, if&#xD;
we open this man's pack, he may pursue us for dama-&#xD;
ges to any amount, but if I shoot it, what amends can&#xD;
he get of me? If there is any thing that should not&#xD;
be there, Lord how I will pepper it! And if it is&#xD;
lawful goods, he can only make me pay for the few&#xD;
that are damaged, which I will get at valuation; so,&#xD;
if none of you will acquiesce, I will take all the blame&#xD;
ul)on myself, and Ware a shot upon it.' Richard said&#xD;
whatever was the consequence he would be blameless.&#xD;
A half delirious smile rather distorted than beauti-&#xD;
fied Alice's pretty face, but Edward took it for an&#xD;
assent to what he had been advancing, so, snatching&#xD;
up Copenhagen in one hand, and the candle in the&#xD;
other, he wasted down the passage, and without hesi-&#xD;
tating one moment, fired at the pack. Gracious&#xD;
Heaven! The blood gushed on the floor like a tor-&#xD;
rent, and a hideous roar, followed by the groans of&#xD;
death, issued from the pack. Edward dropped Co-&#xD;
p~iihagen on the ground, and ran into the kitchen&#xD;
ike one distracted.&#xD;
The kitchen was dark, for he had left the candle&#xD;
in the parlour; so taking to the door without being&#xD;
able to utter a word, he ran to the hills like a wild&#xD;
roe, looking over each shoulder as fast as he could&#xD;
turn his head from the one side to the other. Alice&#xD;
followed as fast as she could, but lost half the way of&#xD;
Edw~ rd~ She was all the time sighing and crying&#xD;
most pitifully. Old Richard stood for a short space&#xD;
rather in a state of petrifaction; but, at length&#xD;
iome hasty ejaculations, he went in to  ,after&#xD;
the parlour.&#xD;
&#xD;

'I he whole floor flowed with blood. The pack hail&#xD;
thrown itself on the ground; but the groans and cries&#xD;
had ceased, and only a kind of guttural noise was&#xD;
heard from it. Knowing that something must be&#xD;
done, he ran after his companions and called on them&#xD;
to come back. Though Edward had escaped a good&#xD;
way and was still persevering on, yet, as he never&#xD;
took long time to consider of the utility of any thing,&#xD;
but acted from immediate impulse, he turned and&#xD;
came as fast back as he had gone away. Alice&#xD;
also came homeward, but more slowly, and crying&#xD;
even more bitterly than before.&#xD;
They were soon all three in the parlour, and in no&#xD;
little terror and agitation of mind unloosed the pack,&#xD;
the. principal commodity of which was a stout young&#xD;
man, whom Edward had shot through the heart, ~nd&#xD;
thus bereaved of existence in a few minutes. To&#xD;
paint the feelings, or even the appearance of young&#xD;
Edward during this scene, is impossible; he acted&#xD;
little, spoke less, and appeared in a hopeless stupor;&#xD;
the most of his employment consisted in gulping&#xD;
down mouthfuls of breath, wipinghis eyes, and star-&#xD;
ing at his associates. It is most generally believed,&#xD;
that when Edward fired at the pack, he had not the&#xD;
most distant idea of shooting a man ; but seeing Alice&#xD;
so jealous of it, he thought the colonel would approve&#xD;
of his intrepidity, and protect him from being wrong-&#xD;
ed by the pedler; and besides, he had never got a&#xD;
chance of a shot at such a large thing in his life, and&#xD;
was curious to see how many folds of the pedler's fine&#xD;
haberdashery ware Copen~iagen would drive the&#xD;
drops through. They made al I possible speed in ex-&#xD;
tricating the corpse, intending to call medical assist-&#xD;
amice, but it was too late; the vital spark was gone&#xD;
for ever. 'Alas!' said old Richard, heaving a deep&#xD;
sigh, 'poor man, 'tis all over with him! I wish he&#xD;
bad lived a little longer to have repented of this, for&#xD;
he has surely died in a bad cause. Poor man! he&#xD;
was somebody's son, and no do~bt dear to them, and&#xD;

regularr gradation, become the fruits of'.' Rithard&#xD;
came twice across his eyes with the sleeve of his&#xD;
shirt, for he still wanted his coat; a thought of a&#xD;
tender nature shot through his heart. 'Alas, if his&#xD;
parents are alive how will their hearts bear this, p~r&#xD;
creatures!' said Richard weeping outright, 'poor&#xD;
creatures! God pity them!' The way that he was&#xD;
packed up was artful anti curious. His knees were&#xD;
brought up towards his breast, and his feet and legs&#xD;
stuffed in a wooden box; another box, a size larger;&#xD;
and wanting the bottom, made up the vacancy be.&#xD;
twixt his face and knees, and there being only one&#xD;
fold of canvass aroi~nd this, he breathed with the&#xD;
greatest freedom; but it had undoubtedly been the&#xD;
heaving of his breast which had caused the move-&#xD;
ment noticed by the servants. His right ar~n was&#xD;
within the box, and to his hand was tied a cutlass,&#xD;
with which he could rip himself from his confinement&#xD;
at once. There were also four loaded pistols secreted&#xD;
with him, and a silver wind-calL On coming to the&#xD;
pistols and cutlass, 'Villain,' said old Richard, 'see&#xD;
what he has here. But I should not call him villain.'&#xD;
said he, again softening his tone, 'for he has now&#xD;
gone to answer at that bar where no false witness,&#xD;
nor loquacious orator, can bias the justice of the sen-&#xD;
tence pronounced on him. He is now in the true&#xD;
world, and I am in the false one. We can judge&#xD;
only from appearances, but thanks to our kind Maker&#xD;
and Preserver, that he was discovered, else it is&#xD;
probable that none of us shoiild~ have again sepn the&#xD;
ightof day.' These moral reflections from the&#xD;
mouth of old Richard by degrees raised the spirits of&#xD;
Edward; he was~bewildered in uncertainty, and had&#xD;
undoubtedly given himself up for lost; but he now&#xD;
began to discover that he had done a meritorious and&#xD;
manful action, and for the first time, since he had&#xD;
fired the fatal shot, ventured to speak. 'Faith itwas&#xD;
lucky that I shot then,' said Edward; but neither of&#xD;
his companions answered good or bad. Alice, though&#xD;
rather grown desperate, behaved and assisted at this&#xD;
224&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MYSTERIOUS PACK.&#xD;
otoody affair, better than might have been expected.&#xD;
Edward surveyed the pistols all round, two of which&#xD;
were of curious workmanshi~. 'But what do you&#xD;
think he was going to do with all these?' said Ed-&#xD;
ward.- 'I think you need not ask that,' Richard an-&#xD;
swered. 'Faith it was a mercy that I shot after all,'&#xD;
said Edward, 'for if we had loosed him out, we&#xD;
should have' been all dead in a minute. [have given&#xD;
him a devil of a broad-side, though. But look ye,&#xD;
Richard, Providence has directed me to the right&#xD;
5j)O1, for I might as readily have lodged the contents&#xD;
of Copenhagen in one of these empty boxes.' 'It has&#xD;
been a deep-laid scheme,' said Richard, 'to murder&#xD;
us, and rob our master's house; there must certainly&#xD;
be more concerned in it than these two.'&#xD;
Ideas beget ideas, often quite different, and then&#xD;
others again in unspeakable gradation, which run&#xD;
through and shift in the mind with as much velocity&#xD;
as the streamers around the pole in a frosty night.&#xD;
On Richard's mentioning more concerned, Edward&#xD;
instantaneously thought of a gang of thieves by night.&#xD;
How be would break the leg of one, shoot another&#xD;
through the head, and scatter them like chaff before&#xD;
the wind. He would rather shoot one robber on his&#xD;
feet or on horseback than ten lying tied up in 1)acks;&#xD;
and then what a glorious prey of pistols he would get&#xD;
frotu the dead rascals; how he would prime and load&#xD;
and fire away in perfect safety from within! how&#xD;
Alice would scream, and Richard would pray, and&#xD;
all would go on with the noise and rapidity of a wind-&#xD;
mill, and he would acquire everlasting fame. So&#xD;
high was the young and ardent mind of Edward&#xD;
wrought up by this train of ideas, that he was strid-&#xD;
ing up and down the floor, while his eyes gleamed as&#xD;
with a tint of madness. 'Oh! if I had but plenty of&#xD;
guns. and nothing ado but to shoot, how I woul(l pep-&#xD;
per the dogs!' said he with great. vehemence, to the&#xD;
no small astonishment of his two associates, who&#xD;
thought him gone mad. 'What can the fool mean?'&#xD;
said Richard, 'what can he ail at the dogs?' 'Oh, it&#xD;

is the robbers that I mean,' said Edwart4 'What&#xD;
robbers, you young fool?' said Richard. 'Why,&#xD;
do you not think that the peddler will come back at&#xD;
the dead of the night to the assistance of' his friend,&#xD;
and bring plenty of help with him too,' said Ed..&#xD;
ward. 'There is not a doubt of' it,' said Alice, and&#xD;
~both stood up stiff with fear and astonishment. '01),&#xD;
merciful heaven! what is to become of us,' said Alice&#xD;
again, 'what are we to do?' 'Let us trust in the&#xD;
Lord,' said old Richard. ' I intend, in the first&#xD;
place, to trust in old Copenhagen,' said Edward,&#xD;
putting down the frizzel, and making it spring up&#xD;
again with a loud snap five or six times, 'but, good&#xD;
Lord! what are we thinking about? i'll run and&#xD;
gather in all the guns in the county.'&#xD;
The impulse oi'the moment was Edward's monitor.&#xD;
Off he..ran like fire, and warned a few of the Colo-&#xD;
nel's retainers, who he knew kept guns about them;&#xD;
these again warned others, and at eight o'clock they&#xD;
had twenty-five men in the house and sixteen loaded&#xD;
pieces, including Copenhagen, and the four pistols&#xD;
found on the deceased. These were distributed&#xD;
amongst the front windows in the upper stories, and&#xD;
the rest armed with pitch-forks, old swords, and cud-&#xD;
gels, kept watch below. Edward had taken care to&#xD;
place himself with a comrade, at a window immedi~.&#xD;
ately facing the approach to the house, and now,&#xD;
backed as he was by such a strong party, grew quite&#xD;
impatient for another chance with his redoubted Co-&#xD;
penhagen. All, however, remained quiet, until an&#xD;
our ast midnight, when it entered into his teeming&#xD;
brain to blow the thief's silver wind-call ; so, without&#xD;
warning any of the rest, he set his head out at the&#xD;
window, and blew irntil all the hills and woods,&#xD;
around yelled their echoes. This alarmed the guards,&#xD;
as not knowing the~meaning of it; but how were&#xD;
they astonished at hearing it answered by another at&#xD;
no great distance. rrhe state of anxiety into which&#xD;
this su(lden and unforeseen circumstance threw our&#xD;
a~'med peasants, is more easily conceived than de~&#xD;

ascribed. The fate of their master's great wealth,&#xD;
and even their own fates, wa~ soon to be decided,&#xD;
and none but He wh~ surveys and over-rules futurity&#xD;
could tell what was to be the issue. Every breast&#xD;
heaved quicker, every breath was cut short, every&#xD;
gun was cocked and pointed toward the court-gate,&#xD;
every orb of vision was strained to discover the ap-&#xD;
proaching foe, by the dim light of the starry canopy,&#xD;
and eve~y ear expanded to catch the distant sounds&#xD;
as they floated on the slow frosty breeze.&#xD;
'rhe suspense was not of long continuance. In&#xD;
less than five minutes the trampling of horses was&#xD;
heard, which increased as they approached to the&#xD;
noise of thunder, and in due course~ a body of men&#xD;
on horseback, according to the account given by the&#xD;
Colonel's people, exceeding their own number, came&#xD;
up to a brisk trot, and began to enter the court-gate.&#xD;
Edward, unable to restrain himself any longer, fired&#xD;
Copenhagen in their faces; one of the i'oremost drop-&#xD;
ped, and his horse, made a spring towards the halt&#xD;
door. This discharge was rather premature, as the&#xD;
wall still shielded a part of the gang from the win-&#xD;
dows. It was, however, the watch-word to all the&#xD;
rest, and in the course of two seconds, the whole six-&#xD;
teen guns were discharged at them. Before the&#xD;
smoke dispersed they were all fled, no doubt greatly&#xD;
amazed at the receptic~i which they met with. Ed-&#xD;
ward and his comrade ran down stairs to see how&#xD;
matters stood, for it was their opinion that they had&#xD;
shot them every one, and that their horses had taken&#xD;
fright at the noise, and gallopped off without them;&#xD;
but the club below warmly protested against their&#xD;
opening any of the doors till day, so they were oblig-&#xD;
ed to beta ke themselves again to their birth up&#xD;
stairs.&#xD;
'Vhough our peasants had gathered a little courage&#xD;
and confidence in themselves, their situation was cu-&#xD;
rious, and to them a dreadful one; they saw and&#xD;
heard a part of their fellow-creatures moaning and&#xD;
expiring in agonies in the open air, which was in-&#xD;

tensely cold, yet durst not go to administer the least&#xD;
relief, for fear of a surprise. An hour or two after&#xD;
this great brush, Edward and his messmate descend-&#xD;
ed again, and begged hard for leave to go and recon-&#xD;
noitre for a few minutes, which after some disputes&#xD;
was granted. They foundonly four men fallen, who&#xD;
appeared to be all quite dead.-One of them was&#xD;
lying within the porch. 'Faith,' said Edward,&#xD;
'here's the chap that I shot.' The other three were&#xD;
without at a considerable distance from each other.-&#xD;
They durst not follow their track farther~ as the road&#xD;
entered betwixt groves of trees, but retreated into&#xD;
their posts without touching any thing.&#xD;
About an hour before day, some of them were&#xD;
alarmed at hearing the sound of horses feet a second&#xD;
time, which however, was only indistinct and, heard&#xD;
at considerable intervals, an&amp;amp; nothing of them ever&#xD;
appeared. Not long after this, Edward and his&#xD;
friend were almost frightened out of their wits, at&#xD;
seeing, as they thought, the dead man within the&#xD;
gate, endeavoring to get up and escape. They had&#xD;
seen him dead, lying surrounded by a deluge of con-&#xD;
gealed blood, an4 nothing but the ideas of ghosts and&#xD;
hobgoblins entering their brains, they were so indis-&#xD;
creet as never to think of firing, but ran and told the&#xD;
tale of horror to some of their neighbours. The sky&#xD;
was by this time grown so dark, that nothing could&#xD;
be seen with precision, and they all remained in&#xD;
anxious incertitude, until the opening day discoVered&#xD;
to them, by degrees, the corpses were removed, and&#xD;
nothing left but large sheets of frozen blood; the&#xD;
morning's alarms by the ghost and the noise of hor-&#xD;
ses, having been occasioned by some of the friends of&#xD;
the men that had fallen, conveying them away for&#xD;
fear of a discovery.&#xD;
Next morning the news flew like fire, and the&#xD;
three servants were much incommoded by crowds of&#xD;
idle and officious people that gathered about the&#xD;
house, some inquiring after the particulars, some&#xD;
begging to see the body that lay in the parlour, and&#xD;

others pleasing themselves with poring ovei the sheets&#xD;
of crimson ice, and tracing the drops of blood on the&#xD;
road down the wood. On the arrival of the Colonel,&#xD;
advertisements were issued, and posted up in all pub-&#xD;
hc places offering rewards for a discovery of any per-&#xD;
son killedor wounded of late. All the dead and sick&#xD;
within twenty miles were inspected by medical men,&#xD;
and a most extensive search made, l)ut to no purpose.&#xD;
It was too late; all was secured. Some indeed were&#xD;
missing, but plausible pretences being made for their&#xD;
absence, nothing could be done. But certain it is,&#xD;
sundry of these were never seen any more in the.&#xD;
count ry, though many of the neighbourhood declared&#xD;
they were such people as no body gould suspect.&#xD;
The body of the unfortunate man who was shot in&#xD;
the pack lay open for inspection a fortnight, but none&#xD;
would ever acknowledge so much as having seen him.&#xD;
The Colonel then caused him to be buried at Belling-&#xD;
ham; but it was confidently reported, that his grave&#xD;
was opened and his corpse taken away. In short,&#xD;
not one engaged in this base and bold attempt was&#xD;
ever discovered. A constant watch was kept by&#xD;
night for some time. The Colonel rewarded the&#xD;
defenders of his house liberally. Old Richard re-&#xD;
mained in the family during the rest of his life, and&#xD;
had a good salary f6r only saying prayers, amongst&#xD;
the servants every night. Alice was married to a&#xD;
tobacconist at Hexham. Edward was made the&#xD;
Colonel's gamekeeper, and had a present of a fine&#xD;
gold-niounted gun given him. His master afterwards&#xD;
procured him a commission in a regiment of foot,&#xD;
Mrhere he suffered many misfortunes and disappoint-&#xD;
ments. He was shot through the shoulder at the&#xD;
battle of Fontenoy, but recovered, and retiring on&#xD;
half-pay, took a small farm on the Scottish side. His&#xD;
character was that of a brave, but rash officer~ kind,&#xD;
generous, and openhearted in all situations. I have&#xD;
often stood at his knee and listened with amazement&#xD;
to his stories of battles and sieges, but none of them&#xD;
ever pleased me better than that of the Long Pack.&#xD;

THE!&#xD;
&#xD;
CONJUROR.&#xD;
&#xD;
A ~oou old villager, who went in the country by&#xD;
the appellation of Robin, that had always earned his&#xD;
bread by the sweat~ of his brow, and to whom a&#xD;
morsel of fat bacon was a princely meal, had heard&#xD;
so much said in commendation of delicious fare, as&#xD;
partridges, pheasants, ortolans, and such like; and&#xD;
those nectareous liquors Burgundy and Champaign,&#xD;
that he longed so ardently for such a regale as to&#xD;
think he would be very well contented to die, provid-&#xD;
ed he might first be permitted to satisfy his longing.&#xD;
Necessity is the mother of invention. Robin,&#xD;
whose ability was far from sufficient to procure those&#xD;
dainties, hit upon a scheme that he imagined would&#xD;
infallible procure him success. He resolved to travel&#xD;
to a distant part of the country, where he was not&#xD;
knowt~, and to take upon him the title of a con&#xD;
a profession which has ever commanded great res-&#xD;
pect both in town and country; and that in case any&#xD;
person whose wit proved lighter than his purse,&#xD;
should be fool enough to confide in his art, he&#xD;
would stipulate for three dainty repasts before his&#xD;
oracle should deign to break silence.&#xD;
Before he set out on his expedition (what will per-&#xD;
baps seem very surprising to most of our readers who&#xD;
*re uninspired of the muses,) he weighed in a just&#xD;
f~SQ&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CONJUROR.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
-U-&#xD;
&#xD;
* and tqual balance the dainties he promised himself&#xD;
to enjoy, against the kicks and cuffs he must inerit~-&#xD;
bly receive when found out to be an impostor; and,&#xD;
lo! the kicks and cuffs turned the beam. And now&#xD;
having equipped himself with a large hairy cap made&#xD;
of the skin of a badger, a p air of whiskers in which a&#xD;
Spaniard might have taken pride, and a common&#xD;
prayer-book in old print, by way of a conjuring-hook,&#xD;
heb ade adieu to his village, and directed his steps to&#xD;
more populous cities; pubiishing~wherever he caine&#xD;
his ore at and profound science in the art of divi-&#xD;
nation.&#xD;
He arrived at length at the hospitable gates of Sir&#xD;
'rony Simpleton, Baronet, with whom most of our&#xD;
readers we presume are acquainted; for no family in&#xD;
Britain can boast of a more extensive progeny. Their&#xD;
origin is easily traced beyond the deluge, and their&#xD;
illustrious ancestors have often wielded the royal&#xD;
sceptre. Now so it happened that a day or two be-&#xD;
fore the arrival of honest I3~obin, fhree of Sir Tony's&#xD;
servants, who had long since formed a combination&#xD;
against a certain diamond ring of great value, which&#xD;
Lady Simpleton usually wore on her finger; and&#xD;
having found it straying upon her toilette had seized&#xD;
it as a lawful prize, with an intent to dispose of it&#xD;
the first opportunity, and share the spoil among&#xD;
themselves. My lady, afflicted for the loss of her&#xD;
brilliant, hearing of the fame of our conjuror which&#xD;
had by this time spread all over the country, resolv-&#xD;
ed to apply to him, in order to gain intelligence of it.&#xD;
My lady was struck with most reverential awe at&#xD;
the venerable appearance of our conjuror, who acted&#xD;
his part to the life. 'Madam, (said he,) it is need-&#xD;
less for you to enter into any detail of your loss. I&#xD;
know, by virtue of the occult science which I pro-&#xD;
fess, that you have lost your diamond ring; and am&#xD;
much better acquainted with every circumstance&#xD;
than your ladyship.'-' Good God! (cried my lady,&#xD;
amazed that the~conjuror should be acquainted with&#xD;
what every body in the town knew as weJ~ as him&#xD;

self,) what a wonderful man[what a fine thing it is&#xD;
tobe a conjuror!'&#xD;
She now began to enquire very earnestly whether&#xD;
she might entertain any hopes of recovering her&#xD;
ring? Robin with the utmost gravity assured her&#xD;
that within the space of t!~ree days he woul(l produce&#xD;
the ring, though it lay at the bottom of mount Etna.&#xD;
'But, (added he, the search will be attended with&#xD;
some expense.) Lady Simpleton told him, she&#xD;
would not hesitate at paying him any reasonable&#xD;
gratuity, as she had a great value for the ring.'&#xD;
Madam, (replied Robin, we conjurors are above any&#xD;
mercenary views. All I demand is, that, during the&#xD;
three days I consult the motion of the l)lanets, Von&#xD;
will give orders for my being entertained in a man-&#xD;
ncr suitable to the dignity of a wizard of nay impor-&#xD;
tance; for we conjurors, you must know, differ&#xD;
widely from the studios in other arts and sciences,&#xD;
who improve most upon a slender diet: we, on the&#xD;
contrary, always study best upon a full stomach; and&#xD;
the richer our fare the greater progress we make in&#xD;
our studies.' Lady Simpleton told him his demands&#xD;
were too modest not to be complied with, and imme-&#xD;
diately ordered him to be conducted to QflC of the&#xD;
best apartments in the house, laying strict injunc-&#xD;
tions upon the cook to obey his commands to a tittle.&#xD;
The cook~aving put on his cleanest cap and apron,&#xD;
waited upon the conjuror, and with much scraping&#xD;
ani~ cringing desired to know what his honour would&#xD;
be pleased to order for supper. Robin, finding the&#xD;
lady had left.him a carte blanche, made a catalogue&#xD;
of the choicest viands he could think of, and de-&#xD;
sired to have them all by rotation. The cook tossed&#xD;
him up a fricassee of chickens in a trice, which with&#xD;
a brace of partridges and a custard, composed a pret-&#xD;
ty sort of a repast-The eyes of our conjuror spark-&#xD;
led with joy at the sight of so delicious a banquet.&#xD;
He tucked his napkin under his chin; and being a&#xD;
man of business scorned to leave a~bone unpicked.&#xD;
Having supped to his heart's content, and closed his&#xD;

&#xD;
entertainment with a cheerful bottle of claret, he re&#xD;
p aired to his downy bed in the pleasing thoughts of&#xD;
his three repasts which were yet to come.&#xD;
The next morning, as soon as it was well light,&#xD;
Robin,, got to carousing again, and remained up to&#xD;
the chin in grease till bed-time; when the fumes of&#xD;
the generous liquors he had quaffed all day mounting&#xD;
into his pericranium so intoxicated him that he could&#xD;
hardly stand: he made shift, however, though not&#xD;
without macli difficulty, to reel to his bed; he h~d&#xD;
just got between the sheets when one of the servants&#xD;
who had been concerned in stealing the ring came&#xD;
into the room, under pretence of clearing the table&#xD;
but in reality to observe what the conjuror was do~&#xD;
ing, for he and his associates were in great appre.&#xD;
tensions lest their theft should be discovered. Robin&#xD;
hearing somebody in the room drew back the cur-&#xD;
tain, an(l seeing what the servant was about, '\Vell,&#xD;
said he, (with a hiccup,) 'thank God, there is ~ne&#xD;
of them, however;' meaning one of the three repasts.&#xD;
A guilty conscience needs no accuser. The footman&#xD;
imagining that the conjuror had discovered the au-&#xD;
thor of the theft by the great power of his art, and&#xD;
that his discourse was addressed to him, ran down&#xD;
to his companions in a panic, and related what he&#xD;
had heard. Fear made him exaggerate every cir~&#xD;
cumstance. He assured them the conjuror was well&#xD;
informed of the whole affair, and that they had noth-&#xD;
ing now to do but to consult their own safety by a&#xD;
precipitate retreat.&#xD;
The other two were greatly alarmed at this re-&#xD;
cital. and were at a loss for some time what to re-&#xD;
solve upon, till one of them proposed going into the&#xD;
conjuror's room the next rught, that they might be&#xD;
thoroughly satisfied their apprehensions were well&#xD;
founded, since fear might have ~ d so strongly&#xD;
~mpon his companion as to occasion misinterpret-&#xD;

MARVELLOUS REPOSITORY.                                  THE CONJUROR.&#xD;
&#xD;
I I&#xD;
&#xD;
man at a lord-mayor's feast had just risen from table.&#xD;
The footman immediately began to take away, cast-&#xD;
ing an eye now and then upon the conjuror, whose&#xD;
eyes he as often found fixed upon him. 'Well,' said&#xD;
Robin, 'thank God, there are two of them, however.'&#xD;
The poor fellow was quite thunderstruck at the&#xD;
sound; the dish dropped from his hand~ his knees&#xD;
knocked together with the fright, and could hardly&#xD;
support him to carry a confirmation of the dreadful&#xD;
news to his companions.&#xD;
The testimony of the first being now corroborated&#xD;
by that of the second, no doubt could possibly remain,&#xD;
unless to the third, who indeed was the most in-&#xD;
credulous of -the three. He told them he did not&#xD;
think it at all improbable that the relation of the&#xD;
first might have a stronger imwesi~ion upon the&#xD;
second, so as to make him imagine he heard the&#xD;
same words spoken, though, at the same time, per-&#xD;
haps, the conjuror had never broke silence~ and what&#xD;
the more firmly confirmed him in this opinion was,&#xD;
that he had told my lady that he should not be able&#xD;
to give her any tidings of her ring until the expira-&#xD;
tion of the three days. After many debates and&#xD;
learned arguments pro and con, it was at length&#xD;
agreed that the third should go into the conjuror's&#xD;
chamber the succeeding night; and in case he should&#xD;
be convinced that their fears were but too justly&#xD;
founded, a council should be immediately held how&#xD;
to act in the ease.&#xD;
'The next day passed on like the two preceding&#xD;
ones with this difference only, that Robin resolved to&#xD;
make the most of his last meal, and laid about him&#xD;
with redoubled vigour, that he might be better able&#xD;
to sustain the bastinado which he foresaw, without&#xD;
the assistance of art-magic, would be the reward of&#xD;
his fraud. 'When bed-time approached, the. third&#xD;
footman made his appearance, and, with many bows&#xD;
and scrapes, was preparing to disserve the table,&#xD;
when Robin broke out in his wanted ejaculation.&#xD;
Well, thank God,' said he, 'I have got them all&#xD;
234&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Lhree. I am now content and have nothing rriore to&#xD;
desire. Friend,' continued he, addressing himself&#xD;
to the footman, 'tell your mistress I shall do myself&#xD;
the honour of waiting on her in the morning.' The&#xD;
lacqucy replied not, but went away with a heavy&#xD;
heart to inform his companions of what he had heard,&#xD;
who made no doubt that the con juror inten(led to&#xD;
inform the lady of the theft. They spent the re-&#xD;
maining part of the night in deliberating what was&#xD;
best to be done, and resolved at length to throw&#xD;
themselves upon the conjuror's mercy, who they&#xD;
thought seemed to be a good-natured man, notwith-&#xD;
standing his formidable cap and whiskers.&#xD;
The next morning, as soon as Robin arose, they&#xD;
threw themselves at his feet, deposited the ring in&#xD;
his hands, and confessed their guilt, supplicating&#xD;
him in the most moving terms to have pity on them,&#xD;
and 'conceal the affair from their lady, as a halter&#xD;
would be the undoubted consequence of such a dis-&#xD;
covery. 'This was no disagreeable adventure for&#xD;
Robin, whobefore this lucky accident, would wil-&#xD;
lingly have compounded for two hundred lashes.&#xD;
The dreadful ideas of whips and tortures which had&#xD;
occupied his mind since he awoke l)egan to give&#xD;
place to more agreeable expectations of honour and&#xD;
rewards. Having moulded his face into as serious a&#xD;
form as possible; he told them they had acted very&#xD;
prudent iiy in making a voluntary confession of their&#xD;
crime, although he had before discovered it by the&#xD;
all-powerful influence of the planets, and promised&#xD;
them, in consideration of their ingenuous behaviour,&#xD;
to keep their transgressions a secret from their&#xD;
mistress.&#xD;
Having given the servants their hint, Robin went&#xD;
privately into the yard where the poultry was kept,&#xD;
~nd compelled one of the turkey-cocks to swallow&#xD;
the ring. He then waited on Lady Simpleton, and...&#xD;
with the greatest confidence said to her, 'Madam2&#xD;
we have at length, with much toil and study, gained&#xD;
the wished-for intelligence; your ring is safe.'--' 0!&#xD;

~Aess me,' cried Lady Simpleton, 'I ant very glad of&#xD;
it. But where is it? Sir Tony would have been&#xD;
4'ery much vexed had [lost it.'-' You dropped your&#xD;
ring, madam;' continued Robin, 'in the yard in pull..&#xD;
ing ofi your glove, and it was presently after picked&#xD;
up by one of the turkies. Let them all pass in 're~&#xD;
view before me, and I'll engage to arrest the felon.'&#xD;
Lady Simpleton gave immediate orders for the&#xD;
turkies to make their appearance; when Robin,&#xD;
seizing on the turkey, which was a very remarkable&#xD;
one, ordered hi~ to be killed aid opened in his&#xD;
presence, and my lady had the pleasing satisfaction&#xD;
of taking the ring from his belly.&#xD;
She now looked upon our conjuror as a very ex~&#xD;
I raordinary personage, and insisted on his tarrying&#xD;
till next dat, when her husband was expected from&#xD;
London. Robin, who had no objection to a renewal&#xD;
of his carousing cheer, accepted the invitation, and&#xD;
had the honour of dining and supping with her lady..&#xD;
ship, enjoying a fourth day's regale, different from&#xD;
I)iS expectations. rrhe next day Sir Tony arrived.&#xD;
My I~dy flew to him in raptures to inform him&#xD;
what a wonderof a man he had beneath his roof,&#xD;
and assured him, that without th~ conjuror's assist..&#xD;
ance the ring, on which she had set so great a value,&#xD;
would inevitably havebeen lost. Sir Tony, although&#xD;
he was no Solomon, could not rightly digest this&#xD;
story. He swore that the conjuror was a cheat and&#xD;
an impostor, and threatened to have him instantly&#xD;
kicked out of doors.' My lady however prevailed&#xD;
upon her husband to put the other's skill to the test&#xD;
hefore he executed his threats.&#xD;
At that instant a tame robin that used to frequent&#xD;
the house for the sake of a few crumbs of bread,&#xD;
which he would pick familiarly from the hand, flew&#xD;
from the garden into the hall and perched upon Sir&#xD;
Tony's shoulder, who immediately seizing the little&#xD;
warbler, and confining him in a silken handkerchief,&#xD;
ordered Robin to be called, who very cheerfully&#xD;
wade his appearance in expectation of the promised&#xD;
2~6&#xD;
&#xD;
reward. ~' Hark'e, friend,' says Sir Tony, 'I am in~&#xD;
formed you profes6 great skill in necromancy. But&#xD;
as I have ever been an infidel in the point of magic&#xD;
I insist that you convince me by an experiment.&#xD;
Tell me what is inclosed in this handkerchief. I&#xD;
wUl then renounce my credulity, and you shall meet&#xD;
with a reward worthy so great a cabalist. But if, on&#xD;
the contrary, you are incapable of giving me the&#xD;
satisfaction I demand, be assured your insolence shall&#xD;
not escape with impunity.'&#xD;
Poor Robin, conscious of his incapacity to solve&#xD;
the problem Sir Tony had proposed, cursed his ill&#xD;
stars that made him wait the arrival of the baronet;&#xD;
and giving himself ~over for lost, 'Alas! poor Robin,'&#xD;
exclaimed he, 'are you then caught at .la~t?' Sir&#xD;
Tony, astonished at the wonderful penetration and&#xD;
sao'acity of our conjuror, immediately released the&#xD;
ro~ in from his confinement, and joined heartily with&#xD;
my lady in her commendation.&#xD;
Robin, you may depend upon it, was not disagreea-&#xD;
bly surprised when he perceived, by the sight of his&#xD;
namesake, what a fortunate turn his affairs had&#xD;
taken. Sir 'L'ony regaled him a month longer, load-&#xD;
ing him with presents, and assured him at parting&#xD;
that he should always meet with a kind reception at&#xD;
Simpleton-hall; and Robin, whose rapture was no~&#xD;
in its zenith, disdaining any longer to turn the sod,&#xD;
took a ~rand house not far distant from his l)atron's,&#xD;
where ~e still flourishes as t conjuror of renown.&#xD;

Abbey of Reading, where, disguising himself as&#xD;
one of the king's guard, he was invited to the Ab-&#xD;
bot's table. Here, his tooth being whetted by the&#xD;
keen air of the forest, he fed so lustily on a sirloin&#xD;
of beef, that his vigorous appetite was noticed by the&#xD;
master of the ceremonies. " Well fare thy heart,"&#xD;
quoth the Abbot, "I would give a hundred pounds&#xD;
if I could feed so heartily on beef as thou dost. Alas!&#xD;
my weak and squeazie stomach will hardly digest&#xD;
the wing of a rabbit or chicken." The monarch&#xD;
having satisfied his palate, thanked the abbot for&#xD;
his good cheer, and departed undiscovered.-Sorne&#xD;
weeks afterwards, the abbot was arrested, conveyed&#xD;
to London, sent to the Tower, and allowed no food&#xD;
for several days, but bread and water. This treat-&#xD;

PARLIAMENTARY ERROR.&#xD;
A BILL was lately introduced into Parliament, by&#xD;
which it was directed that a penalty of 501. was to be&#xD;
levied for the commission of a particular offence,&#xD;
which penalty it w~s provided should be equally di-&#xD;
vided between the informer and churchwarden of&#xD;

was changed to "transportation for seven years ;~J&#xD;

THE dust has fallen three inches deep in the garret&#xD;
of the Green Dragon, since a stout, bull-necked feb.&#xD;
low with a hooked nose, knocked at the door of the&#xD;
widow Queasy in Fish Lane, and'demanded admit-.&#xD;
tance. It was a stormy night, and the monotonous&#xD;
pattering df the rain against the windows had lulled&#xD;
the good woman into a doze. Perhaps she was pre-&#xD;
disposed to such a state by her constant labour dur-&#xD;
ing the day in knitting stockings, which employ-.&#xD;
ment, together with taking snuff, monopolized her&#xD;
faculties. Be this as it may, the noise at the door&#xD;
soon scattered her "thick coming fancies," and with&#xD;
some trepidation she hobbled' to learn its cause.&#xD;
Scarcely had she uplifted the latch, when a sudden&#xD;
gust of wind beat open the door and extinguished&#xD;
her' candle.-" Are you the wife of Jonathan Quea-&#xD;
sy, who is now absent at sea?" asked a rough voice.&#xD;
"I am that disconsolate woman." "Then, with&#xD;
your permission, I will step in. It is an ugly night,&#xD;
and I am wet and cold." After a moment's silence,&#xD;
lie added, "I can give you some information respect-&#xD;
ing your husband." With that, he pushed back the&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
A dim fire stewed moodily on the hearth. Its look&#xD;
was forbidding; but an inherent fear of scandal im~&#xD;
parts that expression to every thing connected with&#xD;
a widow, especially one whose husband is off at sea;&#xD;
besides, the elements without, were yet more shrew-&#xD;
ishly inclined. Doubtless this reflection was de-.&#xD;
cisive.&#xD;
With all possible expedition, Dame Queasy seized&#xD;
the tongs and exerted her strength in puffing a&#xD;
sullen coal; but the wick had become wet, and seem-&#xD;
ed unwilling to burn. Her features, as they occa-&#xD;
sionally flashed on the view of the stranger, betray-&#xD;
ed the inroads of time and snuff. She had certainJy&#xD;
passed her meridian; and the cap which reposed so&#xD;
demurely on her venerable crown, bespoke the re-&#xD;
spectability of her character. Age, whether in&#xD;
widows or spinsters, is extremely imposing; and her&#xD;
guest, though none of the most refined of God's crea-&#xD;
tures, felt its influence. He hastened to offer his&#xD;
services, which were accepted, and the candle once&#xD;
more emitted a cheerful flame.&#xD;
As the light shone over the countenance of the&#xD;
stranger, the widow anxiously perused its lineaments;&#xD;
but she gave no sign of beholding aught she had&#xD;
seen before. A pair of re~il, frizzled whiskers, which&#xD;
extended into the mouth of their owner; an enor-&#xD;
mous queue reaching nearly to his heels, and a giant&#xD;
frame presented no familiar object. In atone of dis-&#xD;
appointment, she beseeched the "gemman" to take&#xD;
a seat by the fire, and communicate the intelligence&#xD;
he promised.&#xD;
"With all my heart," said the stranger, taking a&#xD;
fresh quid of tobacco, and pulling up in rather an&#xD;
awkward manner, his canvass browsers. "You&#xD;
must know, marm, that about seven years ago I fell&#xD;
in with your husband, old Jot Queasy, at St. Jago,&#xD;
one of the Cape-de-Verds, where we put in to get&#xD;
provisions. Queasy had been taken sick shortly&#xD;
after his arrival there, and his vessel left without&#xD;
him."&#xD;
242&#xD;
&#xD;
"Bless me! how you talk! I declaim e you ha ire set&#xD;
me all of a flatter. Now we heard as how his vessel&#xD;
was taken by that horrid Captain Kidd, and all&#xD;
hands barbarously murdered and sunk in the salt&#xD;
sea; I'm sure~ I have almost cried my eyes out for&#xD;
him. Poor Queasy! I shall never forget how I felt&#xD;
when I heard the shocking news. 'Deacon Tim.&#xD;
mins,' said I, wiping my eyes with my apron-(l'm&#xD;
sure I'd never cry so much for another husband)-.-.&#xD;
'if he had been regularly lost at sea, it would have&#xD;
been a comfort.' But bless me, you say he didn't&#xD;
sail."&#xD;
"Exactly so-(if, marm, you may happen to have&#xD;
a drop of gin, or any sich sort o' thing in the house, I&#xD;
would get on better with my story: my memory is&#xD;
kind o' froze up like.")&#xD;
Mrs. Queasey went to the cupboard, and produced&#xD;
a pot-bellied bottle of Hollands. The stranger did&#xD;
not withdraw it from his lips until he had nearly&#xD;
emptied its contents. Then taking a short, snubby&#xD;
pipe from his pocket, he deliberately filled it with&#xD;
tobacco, heaped on some burning cinders, and began&#xD;
to puff in silence. Some agitating recollection had&#xD;
taken possession of his mind, to judge from the huge&#xD;
volumes of smoke he incessantly belched from the&#xD;
recesses of his whiskers. Mrs. Queasy had to address&#xD;
him repeatedly, before lie could be recalled to a con-&#xD;
tinuation of his narrative. " Eh !-( puff)-aha!&#xD;
Jot Queasy. Very true Where did I leave off?&#xD;
Well, (puff)-fmding the vessel gone on his recove-.&#xD;
ry from the fever, he lingered about the shore&#xD;
awhile, to get a voyage home; and one day fell in&#xD;
with some of my-with some of Kidd's crew, who&#xD;
persuaded him to join them and become a gallant&#xD;
rover."&#xD;
Never was a widow~woman whose husband was&#xD;
off at sea, more shocked than poor Mrs. Queasy, at&#xD;
this information. She wept; wrung tier hands; took'&#xD;
snuff, and wept again, while the stranger continued&#xD;
muttering and smoking to himself. "Jot Queasy,-&#xD;

as hearty a cock as ever sailed--no whiner-nor&#xD;
sniveller-wide awake as a black-fish-poor fellow&#xD;
-hard time at last." The unfortunate widow Quea-&#xD;
sy now blubbered a request to know the particulars&#xD;
of the catastrophe; at the same time gracefully&#xD;
covering her features with a snuffy handkerchief.&#xD;
The stranger took a fresh tug at the gin bottle,&#xD;
filled up his pipe anew, and giving his chair a hitch&#xD;
nearer the fire, proceeded in something like the fol-&#xD;
lowing.&#xD;
"We had been cruising off NewfoundlThd a cou.~&#xD;
siderable time without falling in with any vessels;&#xD;
but at last, luck seemed to have changed. It was on&#xD;
a cold, winter's morning before the break of da~r,&#xD;
that we espied through the dim atmosphere, a tall&#xD;
vessel sleeping, as it were, on the heaving breast of&#xD;
the ocean. Queasy was on the watch. lie hurried&#xD;
below to communicate the pleasing intelligence. I&#xD;
was on deck in a moment. Every thing promised&#xD;
an easy and valuable prize. Soon all hands were&#xD;
roused, and it was determined a select party should&#xD;
n-ian the boats and attempt to take her by surl)rise.&#xD;
Poor Jot was one. The boats stole silently on with&#xD;
muffled oars, while we loaded up our guns. Before&#xD;
they reached the vessel, they were seen and an alarm&#xD;
was given. We heard them clamber up her sides;&#xD;
a terrible conflict followed; when it ceased, no signal&#xD;
of victory was given. XVe discharged our guns.&#xD;
Our broadside was feebly returned; and we continu-&#xD;
ed to pour shot into her for more than an hour. The&#xD;
rising sun discovered her in a sinking condition.&#xD;
We would fain have approached, to learn the fate of&#xD;
our comrades; but a brisk gale springing up, we were&#xD;
obliged to separate, aiA that was the last I ever saw&#xD;
of Queasy. I never felt worse since my name was&#xD;
Robert Kidd."&#xD;
It is impossible to conjecture what exhibitions of&#xD;
grief and despair Dame Queasy might have thought&#xD;
it proper to make, had this woful intelligence been&#xD;
imparted by Deacon Timmins. As it was, her hor-&#xD;

ror at being in the presence of Kidd, mast ere(l every&#xD;
other feeling. She essayed to scre am, but l)er PoIV-&#xD;
ers of speech were paralysed; she strove to rush&#xD;
from the room, but her limbs refused their office.&#xD;
The bloody Kidd had long bcen the bug-bear of&#xD;
New-England; and to be alone with him at that&#xD;
(lismal hour was enough to appal a stouter heart than&#xD;
Dame Queasy's; or indeed of any other widow-wo-&#xD;
man whose husband was off at sea.&#xD;
~t i7i~ long before the widow regained the use of&#xD;
Iwr faculties, and when that time arrived, her fears&#xD;
were insensibly allayed by the apparent pacific dis-&#xD;
position of her guest. Resting his feet upon the&#xD;
fire-dogs, he steadily puffed his tobacco, as if lost in&#xD;
thought. Besides, thought she, if folks should come&#xD;
in and find company in the house, how they would&#xD;
talk! Thus with snutf and reflection she was ena-&#xD;
bled to make a virtue of necessity, and by resuming&#xD;
her stocking, soon knit her apprehensions to repose.&#xD;
It is said that during this memorable evening, Kidd&#xD;
recounted the events of his life. How by scouring&#xD;
the seas for in any years, he had acquired an enor-&#xD;
mous quantity of treasure: how he had buried it in&#xD;
the night on Deer Island, where the place is called&#xD;
Money Hill to this day: how he transferred his right&#xD;
over it to the old Scratch, for his left eye tooth,&#xD;
which is well known to have the power of turning&#xD;
all metals by its touch into gold: how he proceeded&#xD;
up to Boston, where his vessel was immediately&#xD;
seized, and he had a narrow escape: how in lurking&#xD;
about the town, it occurred to him to have heard&#xD;
Queasy mention his wife's living in Fish lane~ how&#xD;
he had great difficulty in finding the house, and&#xD;
finally that he would give her untold gold if she&#xD;
would secrete him in her garret, until he could make&#xD;
his escal)e.&#xD;
How disconcerted was Mrs. Queasy at such a pro-&#xD;
p osal! How embarrassing to a widow-woman, whose&#xD;
husband was off at sea! For five minutes she could&#xD;
do nothing but take enormous l)inches of snuff. True&#xD;

she was~nearly old enough to be Kidd's mother; but&#xD;
then folks would talk. How distressing! She had&#xD;
a spare bed up in the attic-and then if he should&#xD;
be hung through h~r cruelty, she might be tea~.ed&#xD;
with his ghost--and'then too the gold-and then the&#xD;
protection of having a man in the house--but her&#xD;
compliance costher a world of maccaboy.&#xD;
There was one thing Mrs. Queasy particularly&#xD;
wished to know. Capt. Kidd had bargained with&#xD;
the old Scratch. What sort of looking creature was&#xD;
he?&#xD;
"XVhy he appeared a thin elderly man, in a 1)01)&#xD;
wig, velvet breeches and glasses. His sallow skin&#xD;
was drawn as tight over his jaws as the 1)archinent of&#xD;
a drum. He had a keen look-appeared remarka-&#xD;
fly sanctified, and moreover had a trick of continu-&#xD;
ally turning on his heel, and blowing his nose."&#xD;
"Did he' have a long tail and a cloven foot?"&#xD;
"Why as to the tail, I can't tell-for the cunning&#xD;
kna~Te wouldn't let me get round him; am1 his cloven&#xD;
'feet, if he had any, were hid in a pai.r of shQes with&#xD;
silver buckles. Egad, much as I coulkl do to look&#xD;
after the bargain, without minding such kind of non-&#xD;
sense !" Here Kidd bern to puff inveterately, and&#xD;
the widow was silent.&#xD;
But the old Scratch in parting with his golden&#xD;
tooth, had no idea of bidding it a permanent adieu.&#xD;
~His malignant soul could not bear the idea of a mor-&#xD;
'~tal's enjoying so much wealth; and being sanguine&#xD;
of speedily taking possession of the pirate, he had re~,&#xD;
luctantly acceded to his terms and given up the&#xD;
tooth. Kidd was shortly after taken in Boston streets&#xD;
in the disguise of a gentleman and executed. But&#xD;
what was the rage and mortification of the old&#xD;
Scratch, in hunting for the tooth to find it missing!&#xD;
He departed in a huff, leaving the carcase to the&#xD;
'medical vultures who were already on the approach,&#xD;
having snuffed the prey from afar.&#xD;
Now it happened that Kidd, in smoking at the&#xD;
widow Queasy's, was exceedingly annoyed by the&#xD;

THE GOLDEN TOOTH.-PART II.&#xD;
&#xD;
ONE mild, sunny afternoon in the beginning of au-&#xD;
(umn, Tobias Grubb, the famous self-taught grave-&#xD;
digger, threw off his jerkin, and began to turn up&#xD;
the sods in the west corner of Copps Hill burying-&#xD;
place. r1~here was nothing in the outward appear-&#xD;
247&#xD;
&#xD;
sensibibtyof the Golden Tooth. Threepuffs heated&#xD;
*     it heyori(I endurance; and knowing the art, he took&#xD;
it from the socket, lest it should roast all the marrow&#xD;
in his jaw. In the hurry of his departure, it was left&#xD;
.1    behind, and on returning to recover it, he met his&#xD;
doom.&#xD;
*       Long after Kidd's execution, Dame Queasy in ex~&#xD;
arnining some old garments found the tooth, but did&#xD;
not recognize it. On looking in the glass the next&#xD;
morning, she was greatly bewildered at perceiving a&#xD;
large tooth in her upper jaw. She could not tell for&#xD;
her soul how it came there. All day long she toiled&#xD;
arid tugged to get it out. She was eiceedingly~di~-&#xD;
(ressed. How would folks talk!&#xD;
And her female friends did talk of this most won-&#xD;
derful occurrence. Nothing was mentioned through-&#xD;
out the town but the new tooth cut by the widow&#xD;
Queasy. Some, mysteriously shook their heads;&#xD;
others pronounced her a witch, and said she ought to&#xD;
he hung; others gnawed the head of their cane, and&#xD;
stroked their venerable whiskers, but said nothing.&#xD;
In the heat of dispute, the poor woman died, having&#xD;
been fairly worried to death, and was secretly buried&#xD;
with a horse-shoe nailed to her coffin.&#xD;
The story came to light many years after, and the&#xD;
tooth was sought for in vain. A pair of gold and-&#xD;
irons was found about the same time in a garret, at&#xD;
the North End, which I believe are still extant,&#xD;
having been quite lately in the possession of a&#xD;
Madam S-n. But alas, where is the Tooth!&#xD;

MARVELLOL'S REPOSITQRY&#xD;
ance of' this man that betokened extraordinary ge&#xD;
fills: he was a squat, dumpling-head~d creature&#xD;
with a pair of legs much too short for his profession,&#xD;
so that to see him scratching away in a grave, one&#xD;
might mistake him for an overgrown toad in his hole.&#xD;
Nevertheless~, among all the grave-diggers that have&#xD;
flourished at the North End, there never was such&#xD;
an operator with the spade. He would burrow into&#xD;
the ground like, a rabbit; skulls, stones and stumps&#xD;
flew about him incessantly; and then his ease in&#xD;
shoveling himself out of a hole of thrice his depth&#xD;
was marvellous. The annals of grave digging fur~&#xD;
nish no achievements that will vie with those of&#xD;
Tobias.&#xD;
At the period we resume our tale, the history of&#xD;
the Golden Tooth was apparently buried in oblivion.&#xD;
Its wonderful virtue of transmuting metals into gold&#xD;
was, no longer admired, and its possession had ceased&#xD;
to gild the visions of the miser. Time had crept&#xD;
on. The generation that witnessed its powers had&#xD;
passed away, and their descendants regarded the&#xD;
whole as an idle dream, and dismissed it from their&#xD;
recollection.&#xD;
Such was the state of affairs, when Grubb, after&#xD;
moistening his hands and throat, began to drive his&#xD;
mattock into the sconce of mother earth. Slowly&#xD;
and with the air of one who delighted in his employ-&#xD;
ment, did he toss out the fragrant mould and watch&#xD;
the progress of his labour. As he approached the&#xD;
usual depth, his mattqck struck heavily on a solid&#xD;
substance which jarred his arms to the shoulder,&#xD;
and electrified his whole frame. He had dislodged&#xD;
a heavy skull: it seemed to grin a ghastly smile at&#xD;
his discomfiture. Clutching it rudely, he was about&#xD;
to hurl it at a neighboring tombstone, when his eye&#xD;
was attracted by a yellow tooth in the upper jaw.&#xD;
It pleased his fancy. "1 will fasten it to my bunch&#xD;
of tomb-keys," thought he; but the act was never&#xD;
performed. Infatuated Tobi as! didst thou but guess&#xD;
its value!&#xD;

For several weeks the Golden Tooth remained in&#xD;
the grave-digger's pocket with a bit of greasy chalk.&#xD;
No bachelor's linen should go unwashed more than&#xD;
a quarter, and Tobias Grubb was above doing such&#xD;
things for himself. It so happened his time for visit-&#xD;
ing the washerwoman arrived. I say "it so hap..&#xD;
pened," for with some bachelors that period never&#xD;
happens at all. One night in the midst of the Equi-&#xD;
noctial storm, he started with his bundle for the house&#xD;
of Mrs. Scrubs. inauspicious moment! Mrs.&#xD;
Scrubs was vexed, and Tobias' nos~± was harcl!v&#xD;
over the threshold before he made the discovery.&#xD;
His pumpkin head was not without the seeds of dis-&#xD;
cretion, and it turned to a more sallow hue at the&#xD;
s')ectacle&#xD;
Never, I venture me to say, did female softness&#xD;
have so ill a representative. Never before was Mrs.&#xD;
Scrubbs in such a passion. And she had reason.&#xD;
For six mortal days the rain had continued to pour&#xD;
down upon the North End, until her tubs run over&#xD;
and over, and the garret and cellar were all of a&#xD;
flow. During the whole of this miserable time, her&#xD;
(Iwelling was beset with bachelors in quest of their&#xD;
linen, and it now approached the end of the week,&#xD;
and not the least sign of a fair day was visible. Mrs.&#xD;
Scrubs placed her arms akimbo, and scolded from&#xD;
sunrise till the hour of rest. Unhappy washerwo-&#xD;
man! mine eyes drip like an unwrung stocking at&#xD;
the very thought of thy suffering.&#xD;
A rainy week is a sore trial of female gentleness.&#xD;
Many have been frightened from matrimony by the&#xD;
ferocity of damsels on wet washing-days. But if a&#xD;
high-bred lady with a few unwashed ruffs and ruf-&#xD;
fles be allowed to fret at the weather, what fearful&#xD;
explosions of passion, what terrific exhibition-ST of im-&#xD;
patience are to be expected from a poor washerwo-&#xD;
man, who is tease(l wits the soiled frippery of all the&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
s&#xD;
&#xD;
a particular description of this interview. Bacne.~&#xD;
lors and washerwomen seldom agree. Suffice it then.&#xD;
to say, that Tobias did not stand listening to Mrs.&#xD;
Scrubs' eloquence a moment longer than propriety&#xD;
demanded. I will not positively aver the Golden&#xD;
Tooth was in the waistcoat he left with this accom-&#xD;
plished laun~iress; Vsimply assert he never beheld it&#xD;
more. But it is certain, a remarkable yellow grind&#xD;
er was soon after discovered in the mouth of Mrs.&#xD;
Scrubbs, which had thus far escaped the scrutiny&#xD;
of her admirers. Such things are, now-a-days,&#xD;
extremely common. Teeth are more apt to multi.&#xD;
ply in, than abscond from, the mouths of modern&#xD;
belles!&#xD;
Close by the side of Mrs. Scrubs' back window,&#xD;
was a small tenement, occupied by one Nebo Vamp,&#xD;
a snaggle-toothed colbler. It vas a low, beetle-&#xD;
browed building, with a great chimney upon one end&#xD;
that arose so high into the air, as to threaten the&#xD;
whole neighbourhood with destruction. In this shop,&#xD;
Master Vamp kept up an eternal hammering of hole-&#xD;
leat her. Not an hour of the day and night, but w at&#xD;
he was employed in beating out the brains of ohk&#xD;
shoes. Kipper-clapper, , kipper-clapper, was the&#xD;
everlasting song-so that poor Mrs. Scrubs was&#xD;
frequently puzzled to hear herself scold. I doubt&#xD;
whether there is any thing more provoking to a&#xD;
querulous matron, than being unable to hear her&#xD;
own complaints,              snoring      his&#xD;
One night, Master Vamp lay         upon&#xD;
bench with his capstone for a pillow, and a parcel of&#xD;
old shoes for a cover-lit. Something after midnight,&#xD;
his slumbers were disturbed by a rustling noise in&#xD;
the farther corner of the shop. lie raised himself&#xD;
upon one elbow, and. bent his little rat eyes in the&#xD;
direction of the noise. A flood of moonlight beat&#xD;
through a large bull's eye in the roof and fell on the&#xD;
form of an overgrown chimney sweeper, with one&#xD;
hand pressed against his wapper-jaw, as if expiring&#xD;
with the tooth-ach, while he crouched down and&#xD;
250&#xD;
&#xD;
appeared to rummage after something in a pile of&#xD;
rubbish.&#xD;
"What o' the devil are you after?" bawled Nebo.&#xD;
C' A tooth," mumbled the stranger, without raising&#xD;
his head. " I have lost a tooth."&#xD;
"Tooth! you scoundrel-I'll make you lose a&#xD;
pair of them, if you don't sweep yourself out of my&#xD;
shop."&#xD;
"PaiVjon me," rejoined the other, raising and dis-&#xD;
playing a cheek swollen out like a bladder, "I must&#xD;
find the tooth I have lost;" and he began to hoan and&#xD;
moan most piteously.&#xD;
"I suppose" growled Nebo, "you are afraid to&#xD;
leave it, lest some dog should eat it up, and then&#xD;
you would have a dog's tooth?"&#xD;
"Not so," said the stranger. "A villain plunder-&#xD;
ed my jaws of their dearest treasure."&#xD;
"Egad," grinned Nebo,"' if you suffer yourself to&#xD;
be cheated out of your eye-teeth, you aren't a wise&#xD;
one, 1 guess."&#xD;
"Alas! 1 was beguiled~ The wealth of the Indies&#xD;
is in this tooth. 0 that I had it once more!" and&#xD;
he began to search again about the floor.&#xD;
The long forgotteti legend of the Golden Tooth&#xD;
now shot through the recollection of Nebo. "Aha,&#xD;
I have heard something of this. Pray didn't you&#xD;
trade with Kidd; the bloody p irate ?"&#xD;
The stranger answered only by a groan.&#xD;
"rio, ho, ho," cried Nebo, bursting into a horse-&#xD;
laugh. "That, was a cunning knave to cheat the&#xD;
devil."&#xD;
His auditor coughed peevishly, and turned away.&#xD;
Sir," said Nebo, sharply, "'if you want any thing&#xD;
in my way, say it at once :-if you are after teeth-be&#xD;
off ' I've none to spare." ~&#xD;
The stranger continued his search, notwithstand..&#xD;
ing the injunction of the shoe-mender. At length,&#xD;
as if weary of the pursuit, he arose.&#xD;
"I have lost a tooth I value above the whole world;&#xD;

sures me it cannot bejar off: yet I have crept about&#xD;
the neighbourhood until I can hardly straighten my&#xD;
back. I ~nust instantly depart to a distant clime,&#xD;
to attend the roasting of a score of inconsolable&#xD;
widows. To thee I commit the farther prosecution&#xD;
of the search. Ri'store me the tooth, and all Kidd's&#xD;
treasure is thine."&#xD;
Nebo's avarice was strongly excited. "Where,"&#xD;
cried he, eagerly, "may I hope to find it?"&#xD;
"Most likely amongst dust and rubbish:-but&#xD;
now I bethink me, perhaps it may have strayed&#xD;
into the mouth of some unconscious individual; for,&#xD;
being placed within the sphere of attraction, it glides&#xD;
softly into the jaw, like a needle to the magnet. But&#xD;
yetl can hardly believe&#xD;
"Can it be easily extracted ?"&#xD;
"My fingers alone, have power to draw it forci-&#xD;
bly; yet, being turned in the socket nine times&#xD;
against the course of the sun, it will drop into the&#xD;
hand. But I must be hence, and years will elapse&#xD;
before I can return. When thou hast the tooth,&#xD;
cast it into the fire;. I shall instantly receive it; and&#xD;
the glowing coals will change immediately to lumps&#xD;
of gold. 'I'is thy reward-Farewell." So saying,&#xD;
he crawled to the ruinous hearth, and gradually in-&#xD;
sinuated his person up the chimney, like a blizzard.&#xD;
Nebo Vamp continued to stare at the place for at&#xD;
least ten minutes; then slowly sinking on his bench,&#xD;
he bethought him of the past adventure. "Throw&#xD;
it into the fire! If I had the tooth, you wouldn't&#xD;
catch me so, old fellow." A sudden recollection&#xD;
made him spring to the floor an4dance in ecstacy.&#xD;
"I have it! 'Tis mine! I'll marry her to-morrow!&#xD;
Let her scold till her tongue wears out, if she will.&#xD;
o for the light of morning!"&#xD;
How he sped in his wooing, I forbear to relate. I&#xD;
might give a pleasing description of the washerwo-&#xD;
man's courtship; but let it pass. Mrs. Vamp soon&#xD;
scolded herself to death; but as her husband re-&#xD;
tained the tooth, he was not inconsolable. Vamp's&#xD;

THERE appeared at the North End of Boston, in&#xD;
the ~ar 1754, a most singular object, who was look-&#xD;
ed upon by the inhabitants with perplexity and&#xD;
amazement. His countenance was thin; sallow, and&#xD;
shrunken, and fasting or disease had wasted his form&#xD;
to an almost spectral gauntness. His stature, but&#xD;
In digging a cellar near Hancock's wharf, about 25 years&#xD;
ago, the laborers discovered an extensive vault, arched with&#xD;
brick, several feet below the earth's surface. It was supposed&#xD;
to have been built in olden time for the concealment of' smuggled&#xD;
goods; but I imagine it was no other than Vamp's money. chest&#xD;

first step was to build a subterraneous vault* for the&#xD;
reception of his treasure. He engaged in naviga&#xD;
tfon, lightly at first; gradually extended his business,&#xD;
and prospered amazing4y. Years rolled on, like&#xD;
waves chasing each other on the surface of the&#xD;
ocean, and wealth continued to flow into his coffers.&#xD;
He covered the land at the North End so thickly&#xD;
with buildings, that space was hardly left for the&#xD;
cows to move through the streets; he pushed wharve&#xD;
so far into the sea that the harbour was rapidly dis-&#xD;
appearing before him; the canvass of his shipping&#xD;
whitened every ocean, and his warehouses thronged&#xD;
with the productions of every clime. But his mean&#xD;
and grasping disposition changed not with his for-&#xD;
tunes. Riches could not refine his nature, nor pros-&#xD;
perity soften his heart; and though his wealth and.&#xD;
enterprise raised the North End to the dignity of a&#xD;
metropolis, he never was respected by the people,&#xD;
who looked mysteriously at his possessions ana pre~&#xD;
diced him an unhappy end.&#xD;

for a remarkable curve in his back-bone, would have&#xD;
towered beyond the common height, for his legs and&#xD;
neck were drawn out to the length of a crane's; and&#xD;
be stooped so much in his gait, that his long bony&#xD;
fingers, resembling the flippers of a skeleton, nearly&#xD;
dangled on the ground, so as to make him appear at&#xD;
a distai~ce to travel on all fours. But although ex-&#xD;
posure to the sun had withered his face into the ex-&#xD;
pression of a dried peach, there was a piercing keen-&#xD;
ness in the glance of his beady eye and an alacrity&#xD;
in his movements altogether unexpected from the&#xD;
structure of his frame.&#xD;
This strange being seemed possessed with an eter-&#xD;
nal hankering after the teeth of th~ inhabitants. As&#xD;
he glided through the~streets with his head neari&#xD;
three feet in advance of his body, his, eyes wer&#xD;
always fixed on the masticators of passing travellers~&#xD;
The young and the thoughtless, who tripped smilitig-&#xD;
ly along, he would only notice by a hasty examina-&#xD;
tion; it was the aged and th~ shy-4he demure spin-&#xD;
ster and the cautious old man, to whom his especial&#xD;
attention was devoted. Whenever he met with per-&#xD;
sons of this description, he never left them without&#xD;
obtaining an inspection of their jaws; atid if he dis-&#xD;
covered ~. yellow tooth, or one of a bilious complex-&#xD;
ion, his hand was most unceremoniously raised to&#xD;
pluck it. No matter to what head it belonged,-a&#xD;
dignified matron's or a "venerated aunt's," a solemn&#xD;
deacon's or a superannuated mariner's; no matter&#xD;
with what intense affection it was cherished by its&#xD;
dating proprietor; no matter for the agony with&#xD;
which it was yielded up, or how desperately it -was&#xD;
defended&amp;amp; he seemed to consider every yellow tooth&#xD;
indisputably his own. Resistance or expostulation&#xD;
only excited his eagerness; the angry astonishment&#xD;
with which his demand was universally heard did&#xD;
not affect him in the least; he was invincible to eve-&#xD;
ry consideration of safety or compassion. It' he~&#xD;
could but fasten his strong fingers on the tooth, iie&#xD;
needed no other instrument; it was instantly in his&#xD;

possessioti. All attempts to elude his vi~ilance, ow&#xD;
combat his resolution, were in vain, lie clung to&#xD;
an isolated yellow tooth like a sailor to a wreck; the&#xD;
whole world could not make him relax his grasp;&#xD;
he insisted, he begged, he implored, until exhausted&#xD;
with importunity the owne bid it a reluctant fare-&#xD;
well, or it was at last wre ehed forcibly from his&#xD;
I      jaws.&#xD;
The Iirst time this heartless miscreant was seen,&#xD;
happened to be on a Friday afternoon, just at dusK.&#xD;
Tobias Grirhb, an ancient grave digger, h adk knocked&#xD;
the clay from his spade, and was leaving Copps Hill,&#xD;
when a man crept up from behind, and without&#xD;
word or warning~ made a snapat one of his teeth.&#xD;
'robias was highly incensed, and with a desperate&#xD;
I      effort threw the ruffian from him, whose stooping&#xD;
position accelerated his pace down to the bottom of&#xD;
the hill, whither he went like a quail running away&#xD;
from its shell~. That very night, as Tobias was re-&#xD;
turning from the, Green Dragon, he felt a smart&#xD;
twitch at the same tooth. He gazed sharply around,&#xD;
but it was very dark, and he could discover nothing.&#xD;
A few moments afterwards, there was another sensible&#xD;
nibble; again he stopped and listened, but all was&#xD;
still. Somewhat alarmed, he closed his lips firmly&#xD;
together, and quickened his pace; but ere he had&#xD;
proceeded far, another sudden wrench almost dislo.-&#xD;
cated his jaw. He quickly raised his hand to the&#xD;
place, even as an an er lifteth his un e after a sharp&#xD;
bite; but the bait was gone-the tooth had vanished&#xD;
forever!&#xD;
Not many days after this shameful outrage, the&#xD;
mysterious stranger was established in a little dark&#xD;
shop in Frizzel square, as an operator on teeth. His&#xD;
windows were filled with placards, setting forth his&#xD;
j      skill, and advising the public to call and have all&#xD;
their teeth extracted before they grew painful, alleg-&#xD;
ing that "an ounce of prevention was better than a&#xD;
j     pound of cure."  He particularly exhorted the aged,&#xD;
and those in- pGssession of sallow or defective teeth,&#xD;

to beware of the evils of procrastination, &amp;amp;c. Thus&#xD;
in this dim retreat did he lie crouched, wistfully&#xD;
scanning the mouths of passers by, even as a black&#xD;
spider watches from his lurking place the gambols&#xD;
of idle flies. But want of business soon drove him&#xD;
to desperation, and he sallied into the streets to com-&#xD;
wit his lawless depredations.&#xD;
He would generally be seen about ten o'clock in&#xD;
the morning, toiling down Moon-street on his way&#xD;
from Frizzle square to the fashionable promenade&#xD;
in Ann-street. ~is progress was slow, for he often&#xD;
paused and looked about him with a kind of nervous&#xD;
agitation, and there was a wild and anxious roll of&#xD;
his eye that was painfully expressive. Still he gra-&#xD;
dually edged along, peeping under the bonnet of&#xD;
every lady, and thrusting his eyes into the mouth of'&#xD;
every gentleman. The inhabitants were astonished,&#xD;
and gathered around to marvel and admire; but&#xD;
while they stood gaping with wonder, the stranger&#xD;
took advantage of their open mouths and devoted&#xD;
their teeth to his own use with arnazin~ dexterity.&#xD;
The crowd vanished in an instant-but flight afford-&#xD;
ed only a temporary refuge: the stranger was con-&#xD;
tinually on the watch, and a grinder that escaped&#xD;
one day was sure to be eradicated the next. The&#xD;
cormorant eagerness with which he pursued his pur-&#xD;
pose was indescribable. It seemed as if his appetite&#xD;
grew by what it fed on. Day after day, and week&#xD;
after week, beheld him unsatisfied. He ha~inted the&#xD;
streets like a spectre, attacking the boldest inhabi..&#xD;
tants at noon-day, and robbing the watchmen's jaws&#xD;
at night. The havoc he made among the teeth of&#xD;
sea-faring men was terrible; for their habit of chew-&#xD;
ing tobacco imparted a yellow tinge to their grind&#xD;
ers, and the stranger intruded into their boarding-&#xD;
houses, dogged them around dram-shops, and wor-&#xD;
rie(l them so much, that at last no mariners would&#xD;
venture into the port. Terror and consternation&#xD;
prevailed. All business was at an end; and the peo.&#xD;
pie strove, by fasting and humiliation, to obtain&#xD;

relief from this direful visitation. But the busi.&#xD;
ness of destru14ion still raged on, and tne teeth of the&#xD;
inhabitants dj~opped away like leaves before the au-&#xD;
tumnal blast. At length the work seemed finished-.&#xD;
every mouth in the place had been ransacked and&#xD;
pil1aged--and~ the tooth-fiend, after searching many&#xD;
days in vain for another victim, suddenly disap-&#xD;
I      feared.&#xD;
It is impossible to describe the state of the citi..&#xD;
zens after his departure. Fathers mourning for&#xD;
their own teeth and those of their children; and&#xD;
spinsters sorrowing that would not be comforted.&#xD;
Mouths, which had erst abounded in teeth like a&#xD;
shark's, were now tenantless; heads, that had once&#xD;
opened and shut like a steel trap, now toothless and&#xD;
forlorn-" quite chap-fallen !" But time heals every&#xD;
wound, and habit tolerates every privation. Gra-&#xD;
'1&#xD;
dually the people became reconciled to their condi-&#xD;
tion, and forgot their loss, save when the pearls of a&#xD;
rising generation recalled it to their memories.&#xD;
Yet there w ~vs one man in the town, who escaped&#xD;
the general calamity; one, too, whose upper jaw&#xD;
overreached its mate, like the bill of a parrot-one,&#xD;
who sported a set of grinders that would have shamed&#xD;
an hippopotamus. At the first alarm, he had flown&#xD;
to his subterranean retreat, and kept concealed un-&#xD;
til the tempest was hushed. It was Vamp, the mean,&#xD;
the stony-hearted miser. His prodigious eye-teeth,&#xD;
~f which he had always been so proud, and which&#xD;
from his cold and graspin~ disposition were the&#xD;
abomination of the people, still retained their situa-&#xD;
tion. He had early recognized in the tooth-drawing~&#xD;
spectre the identical chimney sweep who visited his&#xD;
cobbler's shop, and his conscience whispered that&#xD;
himself and the Golden Tooth were the cause of his&#xD;
present visitation. Although greatly terrified, he de-&#xD;
termined if possible to elude his search, and he suc-&#xD;
ceeded. The unfortunate devil, though boiling with&#xD;
rage and disappointment, was compelled by other&#xD;
engagements to depart unsatisfied.&#xD;

But the shack his presence ha~ occasioned was not&#xD;
~asi1y forgotten, ~nd old Vamp trembled at the&#xD;
thought of his narrow escape. The constant appre-&#xD;
hension that The devil would ~ounce on him una~&#xD;
wares, made him miserable. is enormous wealth&#xD;
was no longer ~enjoyed, although he still continued&#xD;
to grind the faces of the poor from the mere force of&#xD;
habit. Yet cunning as a serpent, he ceased to &amp;amp;i~-&#xD;
hibit his teeth openly, when their rarity would at-'&#xD;
tract attention: on the contrary he drew his shirt&#xD;
collar up to the to~ of his ears, and buried his mouth,&#xD;
nose and chin be~ind~ an enormous pudding. He&#xD;
purchased a new wig and cocked hat, changed the&#xD;
colour of his clothes, and made a radical alteration&#xD;
in his personal appearance. But his heart remained&#xD;
the same-and those who exulted in the fancied loss&#xD;
of his teeth, found to their sorrow that his miserly&#xD;
propensities still remained, and that he nipped as&#xD;
close as ever.&#xD;
It was three years after the occurrence of the&#xD;
events above narrated, and on a bright winter even-&#xD;
ing about nine o'clock; the inhabitants were crowd-&#xD;
ed close into their chimnies, parching corn and warm-&#xD;
ing themselves before they retired. So universal&#xD;
was this custom, that a stranger, passing through&#xD;
the streets about that hour, could distinguish the&#xD;
snapping of the corn from house to house throughout&#xD;
all the North End. Just as the bell of the Old North&#xD;
Church had ceased to strike, there was heard a shrill&#xD;
and fearful outcry in a distant street. Every tongue&#xD;
stopped and every pulse fluttered. The sound was&#xD;
heard again and nearer. It seemed like the ago-&#xD;
nized shriek of some one in mortal peril. They&#xD;
flew to tbe windows in breathless alarm; bolts and&#xD;
shutters Were withdrawn in an instant.-The cold&#xD;
moon glared upon the crusted snow, and disclosed&#xD;
the hateful form of the tooth-fiend, driving past with&#xD;
the speed of a whirlwind. His cheek was flushed&#xD;
with rage, and his eye flashed fire as he drew after&#xD;
him, by the hare tooth, the' reluctant, shrieking Vamp.&#xD;

The countenance of' the miser was f~ightfully dis..&#xD;
torted. Terror and despair were in his glance, and&#xD;
the blood streamed from his jaw, which resistance&#xD;
and struggling had drawn out like the snout of a pig.&#xD;
His piercing cries for succour thrilled every bosom;&#xD;
but it was for a moment; the next he w~s gone;&#xD;
they pushed after him through the, streets, but in&#xD;
vain-he was never beheld more.&#xD;
Soon after Vamp's disappearance, his property&#xD;
went to wreck and ruin. His ships were cast away&#xD;
at sea, or never returned; his wharves and buildings&#xD;
rotted down untenanted; his land became covered&#xD;
over with squatters; and every vestige of his enor-&#xD;
mous wealth gradually disappeared. About this&#xD;
tiThe, the North'End began to sink into decay. Its&#xD;
business had received a fatal shock by the removal&#xD;
of Vamp; and the alleged appearance of his ghost&#xD;
regularly at midnight, contributed to render its cha-&#xD;
racter unpopular. Meanwhile commerce edged up&#xD;
further and further' towards the South. Wealth,&#xD;
fashion and population soon followed, and the oldest&#xD;
part of the town sank by degrees into comparative&#xD;
obscurity: but even to this day, the native inhabit-&#xD;
ants cling to their patrimonial estates with enthusi-&#xD;
astic fondness, and continue to predict a speedy re-&#xD;
turn of its original pre-eminence. In confirmation&#xD;
of their opinion, they proudly refer to its former&#xD;
greatness,-to its superior accommodations of har-&#xD;
bour; and most confidently aver, that nothing is&#xD;
wanting but the recovery of the GOLDEN TooTH to&#xD;
restore the North End to its ancient splendour and&#xD;
renown.&#xD;

THE following very singular adventure is related&#xD;
as a fact in a French work, entitled La Nouvelle Btb.&#xD;
tiotheque de Societe; and is said to have happened&#xD;
in one of the provinces of France. It is related in a&#xD;
letter to a friend.&#xD;
The adventure which I am going to relate to you,&#xD;
my dear~friend, is of so strange and dreadful a na-&#xD;
ture, that you are the only person to whom I must&#xD;
ever disclose the secret.&#xD;
The nuptials of Mademoiselle de Vildac were&#xD;
celebrated yesterday; at which, as a neighbour, cus~&#xD;
torn and good manners required my attendance.&#xD;
You are acquainted with M. de Vildac: he has a&#xD;
countenance which never pleased me; his eyes have&#xD;
often a wild and suspicious glare, a something&#xD;
which has always given me disagreeable sensations&#xD;
for which I could in no way account. I could not&#xD;
help observing yesterday, that, in ~the midst of joy&#xD;
and revelry, he partook not of pleasure: far from be-&#xD;
ing penetrated with the happinessof his new son and&#xD;
daughter, the delight of others seemed to him a Sc-&#xD;
cret torment.&#xD;
The feast was held at his. ancient castle; and,&#xD;
when the hour of rest arrived, I was conducted to a&#xD;
chamber immediately under the Old Tower at the&#xD;
north end. I" had just fallen into my first sleep,&#xD;
when I was awakened and alarmed by a heavy kind&#xD;
of noise over head. I listened, and heard very dis-&#xD;
tinctly the footsteps of some one slowly descending,&#xD;
and dragging chains that clanked upon the stairs,&#xD;
the noise approached, and presently the chamber-&#xD;
door was opened, the clanking of the chains re-&#xD;
doubled, and he who bore them went towards the&#xD;
chinrney. There were a few embers half extinguish-&#xD;
ed; these he scrape(l together, and said in a sepul.&#xD;
chral voice-" Alas! how long it is since I have seem&#xD;

PAURWIDI~ PUNISHED.&#xD;
&#xD;
a fire !',' I own, my friend, I was terrified: I seized&#xD;
my sword, looked between my curtains, and saw by&#xD;
the glimmer of the embers a withered old man half&#xD;
naked, with a bald head and a white beard. He&#xD;
put his trembling hands to the wqod, which began to&#xD;
blaze, and soon afterwards turned towards the door&#xD;
by which he entered, fixed his eyes with horror upoii&#xD;
the floor, as if he beheld something most dreadful,&#xD;
and exclaimed with agony, "My God! my God !"&#xD;
My emotion caused my curtains to make a noise,&#xD;
and he turned aifrighted. "Who is there ?" said he.&#xD;
"Is there any one in that bed ?"-" Yes," I replied:&#xD;
"an(l who are you?" Contending passions would&#xD;
not for a while suffer him to speak; at last he an-&#xD;
swered, "I am the most miserable of men. This,&#xD;
perhaps, is more than I ought to say; but it is so&#xD;
long, so many years, since I have seen or spoken to a&#xD;
harnan being, that I cannot resist. Fear nothing~&#xD;
come towards the fire listen to sorrows,&#xD;
my         and for&#xD;
a moment soften my sufferings!"'&#xD;
My fear gave place to pity; I sat down by him.&#xD;
My condescension and my feelings moved him; he&#xD;
took my hand, bathed it with his tears, and said-~&#xD;
"Generous man! let me desire you first to satisfy&#xD;
my curiosity. Tell me why you lodge in this cham~&#xD;
her, where no man has lodged before for so many&#xD;
years; and what mean the rejoicing I have heard?&#xD;
what extraordinary thing has happened to-day in&#xD;
the castle ?"&#xD;
When I had informed him of the marriage of Vii-&#xD;
dac's daughter, he lifted up his hands to heaven-.&#xD;
"Has Vildac a daughter? and is she married? Al..&#xD;
mighty God grant she may be happy! grant she may&#xD;
never know guilt!" He paused for a moment-&#xD;
"Learn who I am," sa:id he. "You see, you speak'&#xD;
to the father of Vildac-.-the cruel Vildac! Yet what&#xD;
right have Ito complain? Should 1-should I call&#xD;
man or tiger cruel?"-" What!" exclaimed I, with&#xD;
astonishment, "is Vildac your son? Vildac! the&#xD;

monster! shut you from the sight of man! load you&#xD;

"Behold," said he, "the' power, the detestable&#xD;
power of riches. The hard and pitiless heart of my&#xD;
unhappy son is impenetrable to every tender senti~.&#xD;
ment: insensible to love and friendship, he is also&#xD;
deaf to the cries of nature; and, to enjoy my lands,&#xD;
has hung these eating irons on me.&#xD;
"He went one day to visit a neighboring young&#xD;
nobleman, who had lately lost his father; he saw him&#xD;
encircled by vassals, and occupied in receiving their&#xD;
homage and their rents: the sight made a shocking&#xD;
impression upon the imagination of Vildac, which&#xD;
had long been haunted with a strong desire to enjoy&#xD;
his future patrimony. I observed at his return a de-&#xD;
gree of thoughtfulness and gloom about him that was&#xD;
unusual. Five days afterwards I was' seized during&#xD;
the night, carried off naked by three men masked,&#xD;
and lodged in this tower. I know not by what means&#xD;
Vildac spread the report of my death; but I guessed,&#xD;
by the tolling of the bells and funeral dirges, more&#xD;
solemn than for inferior persons, they were perform-&#xD;
ed for my interment~ The idea was horrid; and I&#xD;
entreated most earnestly to be permitted to speak for&#xD;
a moment to my son, but in vain: those who brought&#xD;
me my food, do doubt, supposed me a criminal con-&#xD;
demned to perish in prison. It is now twenty years&#xD;
since I was first confined here. I perceived this&#xD;
morning that my door was not secured, and I waited&#xD;
till night to profit by the accident: yet I do not wish&#xD;
to escape; but the little liberty of a few yards more&#xD;
is much to a prisoner."&#xD;
"No," cried I, "you shall quit that dishonourable&#xD;
habitation. Heaven has destined me to be your de..&#xD;
liverer, defender, support, and guide. Every body&#xD;
sleeps; now is the time; let us be gone !"&#xD;
"It must not be !" said he, after a moment's Si.&#xD;
lence. "Solitude has changed my ideas, and my&#xD;
principles. Happiness is but in opinion. Now that&#xD;
I am inured to suffer, why should I fly from my fate?&#xD;

What is there for me to wish in this world? The die&#xD;
is thrown, and this tower must be my tomb !"&#xD;
Surely you dream," answered I. "Let us not&#xD;
lose time; the night is advanced: we shall presently&#xD;
have but a moment. Come !"&#xD;
"I am affected," replied he, "but cannot profit by&#xD;
your kindness. Liberty has no charms for my small&#xD;
remains of life. Shall I dishonour my son; or which&#xD;
way has his daughter given me offence, to whom I&#xD;
was never known, by whom I was never seen? This&#xD;
sweet innocent sleeps happily in the arms o(her hus~&#xD;
band, and shall I overwhelm her with infamy? Yet&#xD;
might I but behold her! might I but lock her in&#xD;
these feeble arms, and bedew her bosom with my&#xD;
tears!~ 'Tis in vain! It cannot be! I never must&#xD;
look upon her!&#xD;
"Adieu! day begins to break, and we shall be&#xD;
surprised. I will return to my prison."&#xD;
"No," said I, stopping him; "I will not suffer it&#xD;
Slavery has enfeebled your soul; I must inspire you&#xD;
with courage. Let us be gone; we will afterwards&#xD;
examine whether it be proper to make the matter&#xD;
public. My house, my friends, my fortune, are at&#xD;
your service. No one shall know whoyou are; and,&#xD;
since it is necessary, Vildac's crime shall be con-&#xD;

"Nothing! I am all gratitude! Oh, no! it cannot&#xD;

A traveller went into an inn on a cold rainy day&#xD;
and observing a good fire surrounded by a number&#xD;
of countrymen, thought upon the following~ expedient&#xD;
to get a good birth by the fire-side. Calling the ost-&#xD;

ters, and then take them to his horse in the stable for.&#xD;
him to eat, shells and all. The astonished country-&#xD;
men withdrew, one by one, to see this extraordinary&#xD;
eight, and the traveller placed himself by the side of&#xD;
the fire. The ostler returnedand observed that the&#xD;
horse would not eat them: then said the traveller,&#xD;

The miserable wretch fell convulsed with terror&#xD;
on the floor; and when fear and passion in p~rt sub*&#xD;
sided, he durst not turn his guilty eyes towards me,&#xD;
where I stood transfixed with horror. As soon as&#xD;
he had~the power, he approached the door:-" Fare~~-&#xD;
well," said he, "be innocent, if you would beliap~&#xD;
py! The wretch who solately moved your pity, is&#xD;
now become detestable to you as well as to himself:&#xD;
he goes unlamented to the dungeon, whence alive he&#xD;
never shall return !"&#xD;
I had neither the power to speak or move. The&#xD;
castle had become a place most abominable; and I&#xD;
departed in the morning. I must leave the neigh.&#xD;
bourhood: I cannot bear the sight of Vildac, nor the&#xD;
remembrance of this night. How, my friend, is it&#xD;
possible that humanity can produce wickedness so&#xD;
intolerable and unnatural!&#xD;

CO1~UNICATIVE POCKETS.&#xD;
TN the time of Dr. Faustus, lived at Bamberg a&#xD;
itnight, named Herrman of Runenburg, a handsome&#xD;
young man, who the fair sex in general viewe(1&#xD;
with partial eyes, but whose affections yet continued&#xD;
disengaged. Contrary to the custom of youth, his&#xD;
heart was filled with mistrust: he considered all wo-&#xD;
men as deceivers, and knew their scandalous chroni-&#xD;
cle by heart. He had partly learned the facts from&#xD;
intimate friends and jovial companions, and was&#xD;
partly acquainted with themfrom his own knowledge.&#xD;
At the age of twenty-five this suspicion of the fair&#xD;
sex proved a great drawback on his happiness.&#xD;
Whenever the language of his eyes would have be-&#xD;
trayed him, his- jealous head was sure to check his&#xD;
willing heart, and to impose silence on them. This&#xD;
cost him many a struggle, which usually ended with&#xD;
the exclamation, "How provoking, that no reliance&#xD;
is to be placed on women !" These words had just&#xD;
escaped him, perhaps for the thousandth time, when&#xD;
he was walking on the banks of a river, his eyes&#xD;
fixed on the ground, and his hands joined behind&#xD;
hi~ back. He all at once espied a ring lying on&#xD;
the sand at his feet. He picked it up. It was of&#xD;
gold, in which was encased a crimson stone, it&#xD;
did not seem to be of any great value, but was too&#xD;
pretty to be left where it was. Herrman put it on&#xD;
his finger and slowly pursued his walk.&#xD;
It was not long before he heard some one running&#xD;
after him. He turned, and 'beheld a man of tall&#xD;

stature, and with a face uncommonly wrinkled, whie&#xD;
his eyes glowed like fire beneath his bushy eye-brows.&#xD;
"Strang~ r," said he, "have you found a ring?"&#xD;
"Yes," l~e plied H errman,~ "is it yours?" "It is&#xD;
mine, and most unfortunate shall I be unless I re-&#xD;
cover it." "There it is!" said Ilerrman, and would&#xD;
have pulled it from his finger. "Stop !" cried the&#xD;
ma7n, in a~n authoritative tone; "be not so hasty.&#xD;
You must restore it to me voluntarily."-" XVeIl,&#xD;
there it is, voluntarily?' " I cannot take it till you&#xD;
know who I am, and what virtue resides in this ring.&#xD;
Fate compels me to reveal both, or to renounce the&#xD;
ring for ever, as a punishment for my carelessness."&#xD;
"Speak then !" "I am Dr. Faustus." Herrman&#xD;
started. "I have heard a great deal about you,"&#xD;
said he. "In this crimson stone," continued the&#xD;
other, "is enclosed a powerful spirit. It is obedient&#xD;
to the possessor of the ring. Now you know all. Be&#xD;
generous."&#xD;
Herrman was a good Christian, who wanted to&#xD;
have nothing to do with suspicious spirits. He&#xD;
therefore returned the ring, without ceremony, to&#xD;
the great joy of the sorcerer. "You have acquired&#xD;
a claim to my gratitude," said Dr. Faustus; "tell&#xD;
me how I can serve you?" "I have no occasion for&#xD;
your services," rejoined Herrman. "Who knpws,"&#xD;
replied the other, ~' but what you may at some fu-&#xD;
ture time, if you have not at present; you shall aI~&#xD;
ways find me at your service." With these words&#xD;
he dep~rted. "Ho! Doctor!" cried I{errman, as&#xD;
soon as he was goume; "I have just thought that you&#xD;
may, perhaps, have it in your power to render me an&#xD;
important service just now." "VVhat is it ?" "I&#xD;
would fain find a female on whom to fix my affec-&#xD;
tions." "That is a business for which you don't&#xD;
want my assistance. Beauty is the charm that iiiust&#xD;
operate there." "But I should like to know whether&#xD;
she to whom I would give my heart, is worthy of&#xD;
possessing it. Can you teach me the art of reading&#xD;
wh~it passes in the female bosom?" Dr. Faustus&#xD;
I        266&#xD;
&#xD;
smiled; "Indeed I cannot," said he, "neither cam&#xD;
any of my spirits." "Then, farewell, I have nothing&#xD;
farther to ask."&#xD;
"Hem," muttered the magician. "I should be&#xD;
sorry to let your kindness go unre(1uited. Let us&#xD;
see what we can do. To comply with your wish in&#xD;
its full extent is absolutely impossible, even if I were&#xD;
to raise up Satan himself from the infernal regions;&#xD;
but I can furnish you with the means of accomplish-.&#xD;
ing your object in the majority of cases. Among my&#xD;
sI)irits I have a little artful demon, whom I common-&#xD;
ly use as a spy. I had lent him to a papal nuncio at&#xD;
the imperial court, who is lately dead. A jealous&#xD;
wife has, to be sure, just applied to me for the loan&#xD;
of my Puttli, but you shall have the preference. He&#xD;
shall accompany you wherever you go; he shall slip&#xD;
into the pockets of all the persons with whom you&#xD;
may happen to be in company, and inform you of&#xD;
their contents." "And of what benefit will that be&#xD;
to me?"~ "Of the very greatest, my dear friend. If&#xD;
you did but know what people had in their pockets,&#xD;
you would seldom be mistaken in your opinion con-&#xD;
cerning them." "And if I should be at a loss what&#xD;
inference to draw from the contents of a pocket, can&#xD;
Puttli help me out?" "No: he can only give you a&#xD;
faithful account of what he has found. It will be&#xD;
your business to draw conclusions." "Well, I'll try&#xD;
at least."&#xD;
Dr. Faustus now began to make preparations to&#xD;
summon little Puttli; but Herrman begged to dis-&#xD;
pense with his personal attendance, alleging that it&#xD;
was quite sufficient if he did but hear him. "You&#xD;
shall hear me at the right time," suddenlyy cried a&#xD;
delicate voice, which, in spite of its subtlety, caused&#xD;
the knight to shudder. He soon became familiari~-&#xD;
ed, however,1 with his invisible attendant. It was&#xD;
not long ere he beheld Amalberga, a beautiful female&#xD;
of eighteen, but whose heavenly features were usu-&#xD;
ally overcast with a cloud of dejection. She was an&#xD;
orphan, and had been left unprovided for by he~~&#xD;

father, a celebrated knight, who, on his death-bed)&#xD;
j)urchased with his possessions an exemption from&#xD;
purgatoryy , bequeathing to his child nothing but a&#xD;
spinning-wheel and a loom, and the pious counsel to&#xD;
take the veil. Amalberga, endowed with a warm:&#xD;
and tender heart, felt no predilection for a monastic&#xD;
life. She determined to try whether she could not,&#xD;
by industry, earn sufficient to support herself in the&#xD;
world in a manner becoming her birth. With rigid&#xD;
economy, and by occasionally even abridging the in-&#xD;
tervals of repose, she succeeded in the attempt.&#xD;
Amalberga's beauty fixed Herrnian's eyes, which&#xD;
faithfully transmitted the impression to his heart, but&#xD;
he trembled at the idea of finding her pockets in con-&#xD;
tradiction to the modesty of her demeanour; and it&#xD;
was long before he woidd suffer the sanctuary of in-&#xD;
nocence to be profaned by his roguery. At length&#xD;
he determined to venture. The first experiments&#xD;
proved satisfactory. There was nothing in the&#xD;
locket but a handkerchief and a prayer-book.&#xD;
CC Amalberga shall be mine !" triumphantly exclaim-&#xD;
ed the knight. "Exult not prematurely," cried the&#xD;
malicious demon, "the best women in the world are&#xD;
fickle, one day they stand with one foot in heaven,&#xD;
the next we can scarcely endure them in hell. Try&#xD;
the girl a short time before you suffer her to draw the&#xD;
net tight over your head." Herrman began to think&#xD;
that the devil sometimes talks very sensibly, and&#xD;
adopted his advice. For several successive, weeks&#xD;
Puttli went daily to examine Amalberga's pocket,&#xD;
but daily had to repeat his first report, and the&#xD;
knight heartily enjoyed his triumph. One day,&#xD;
however, a day on which an irresistible gloom again&#xD;
beclouded the virgin's brow-Herrman was on the&#xD;
point of throwing himself at her feet, when the&#xD;
pocket. suddenly whispered-" I contain a forged&#xD;
bill." "Thou liest!" retorted the youth, inflamed&#xD;
with indignation. "Nothing can be more true than&#xD;
that the bill is forged." "Then speak!-how is it&#xD;
to be accounted for"" "I cannot tell." "How came&#xD;

be perfectly innocent." "Perhaps so; but the bill&#xD;
is forged." This discovery vexed the knight, and&#xD;
cqnfldent ~as he was of her virtue, he nevertheless&#xD;
thought fit to defer the declaration of his passion.&#xD;
How was he to clear up this suspicious circumstance?&#xD;
In vain did he rack his brains how this was to be ac-&#xD;
complished. The following day the bill had disap-&#xD;
peared, and the prayer book occupied its usual place.&#xD;
Herrman soon forgot the forged bill; but whenever&#xD;
memory happened to dwell on it, heconsoled himself&#xD;
with his who knows? and at length, when Amalberga&#xD;
was mis sing for two whole weeks (nobody could tell&#xD;
whither she was gone,) this, privation of the sight.of&#xD;
her only served to inflame his passion. At length&#xD;
she appeared again, pale, drooping, and more deject..&#xD;
ed, but likewise more charming than ever. Herr-&#xD;
man's lips opened a second time for the purpose of&#xD;
pronouncing the sweet confession, when Puttli whis-&#xD;
pered from her pocket-" H 'e is poison." "Poi..&#xD;
son ?" "A dose that would s d a troublesome hus-&#xD;
band to the infernal regions~ a trice." The knight&#xD;
was thunderstruck.  ois  in the pocket of a beau-&#xD;
tiful young female! t is .' deed too unaccounta..&#xD;

from its corner, "It is p erhaRs y a cosmetic; a&#xD;
little vanity is pardonable *" " o~ it is poison, I&#xD;
tell you;" and in this declaration the'merciless Puttli&#xD;
persisted. "Well, but may she 'not have procured&#xD;
it merely to destroy the rats?" "Hardly! what&#xD;
should it then be doing in her pocket?" "Perhaps&#xD;
she has received it to-day from some friend, and in-&#xD;
t ~nds to-night to make use of it."&#xD;
Puttli was silent; hut the next and many succes-&#xD;
sive days, he reported, with a sarcastic grin, that the&#xD;
poison was still there. Herrman now sought the&#xD;
cotnpany of Amalberga's uncle, in hopes that by his&#xD;
means he might be enabled to unravel the mystery.&#xD;
He had hitherto l)een rather shy of his acquaintance,&#xD;

for the old knight was known to the whole court to&#xD;
possess a turn for satire, and in his youth had brought&#xD;
himself' into many a scrape by his epigrams. "But&#xD;
let us hear what testimony his pocket will bear him,"&#xD;
said Ilerrman to the officious Puttli; and before the&#xD;
words had passed his lips, the spirit complied with&#xD;
his wish, " Here is a little box with splinters of&#xD;
bones, evidences of the wounds received by the&#xD;
knight in many a conflict for the bishop. Here is a&#xD;
hard crust of bread, probably the reward bestowed&#xD;
by the prelate for his heroic exploits. Here' is also a&#xD;
billet from an old chamberlain." "Read it." "Be-&#xD;
ware, sir knight, of the anger of' the bishop. Your&#xD;
virtuous refusal has inflamed him to fury. He&#xD;
swears to be revenged, and, in spite of you to accom-&#xD;
plish his wicked purpose,' "Is that all ?" " It is."&#xD;
" What has the knight refused to the bishop?" "I&#xD;
do not know." "What wicked purpose has the&#xD;
bishop in contemplation?" "I cannot tell." "Be&#xD;
it what it wi 11, 1 know enough to be convinced that&#xD;
the old knight is an honest man."&#xD;
Herrman now neglected no opportunity of sound-&#xD;
ing him respecting his niece, and even intimated his&#xD;
intentions of proposing an honourable alliance, if&#xD;
only certain mysterious circumstances could be clear-&#xD;
ed up by the uncle's assistance: but he could get&#xD;
nothing more from him than the assurance, on the&#xD;
word and honour of a knight, that his niece was an&#xD;
excellent girl, and that hewished her brother had&#xD;
but a single drop of l3er blood in his ~reins. This&#xD;
testimony was certainly encouraging-but the forged&#xD;
bill !-the poison! "Pshaw !'~ cried Herrman, with&#xD;
impatience, "she may clear up these matters when&#xD;
we are married. At any rate, I will acquaint her&#xD;
with my sentiments." Away he went the third time,&#xD;
firmly resolved to declare to the fair Amalberga what&#xD;
she had long since divined.&#xD;
Once more Putt Ii abruptly cried," Stop !" "What&#xD;
is the matter now, thou unmerciful demon? "Here&#xD;
is a note by the side of the poison." "From whom?"&#xD;

"There is no signature." "Read it." Puttli read&#xD;
as follows :-'~ It gave me pain, dear Amalberga, that&#xD;
you should have murdered my child without the&#xD;
I east pity. But a little reflection convinces me, that&#xD;
I ought to commend your foresight. To have been&#xD;
known as the father, might have been dangerous for&#xD;
me and injurious t~ your reputation. 'What had&#xD;
better remain a secret, would then have been the&#xD;
talk of the town. By thy prudence thou haist put the&#xD;
man to shame. Accept my thanks, thou dear and&#xD;
trustworthy girl." " Confusion," exclaimed Herr-&#xD;
man, "wh~it is this?" "Did you not hear?" rejoin-&#xD;
ed Puttli, drily-" she has mui*lered a child. Now&#xD;
it is evident for what purpose she wanted the&#xD;
poison.',&#xD;
H'errman shuddered. He resolved to banish the&#xD;
image of hypocrisy from his heart forever. But how&#xD;
was he to accomplish this, if he continued to see her&#xD;
every day? He determined to join the crusade&#xD;
against the pagan Lithuanians, and to seek in ruili-&#xD;
tary enterprises either tranquility or death. "Sad-&#xD;
dle my horse," cried he, late the same night to his&#xD;
squire. " The morning sun shall see me far from&#xD;
Bambero~" The steed was saddled, and he sprung&#xD;
on his back. "Shall I attend you?" asked PuttI~&#xD;
"Go to the devil!" replied Herrman, and in an in-&#xD;
stant the little demon vanished with a loud laugh of&#xD;
malicious ~joy.&#xD;
Slowly, and with his eyes fixed on the ground, the&#xD;
youth passed the gate, followed by his trusty squire.&#xD;
TI~e moon threw a feeble light on his road. The&#xD;
night was cool and rainy; but the chill gloom of na-&#xD;
ture was not equal to that which pervaded his 'heart.&#xD;
He had just passed the place of execution, when he&#xD;
heard behind himi'ootsteps of a horse advancing at&#xD;
full speed, and the loud shrieks of a female appa-&#xD;
rently in great distress. Ilerrman immediately con~&#xD;
clouded, that the sounds which assailed his ears origi-&#xD;
nated in some violent attempt.-..-Mindful of the du-&#xD;
ties of chivalry, he turned his horse about, fixed&#xD;

himself firmly in his stirrups, and loudly called out to&#xD;
the person advancing to stop. At the same time his&#xD;
sword glistened in the moonlight, and the trusty&#xD;
squire who carried his lance, brandislwd it over his&#xD;
head till it whizzed again in the air. The stranger's&#xD;
horse, on suddenly finding an obstruction in his road,&#xD;
started back and snorted. The black rider uttered&#xD;
(lreadflll imprecations, and the white figure behind&#xD;
him piteous ly implored assistance. "Make way,"&#xD;
cried the former, "whoever ye be, and let me pass.&#xD;
The girl is my sister; I am carrying her to a con~&#xD;
vent." "'Tis false !" exclaimed the female. "For.&#xD;
heaven's sake have compassion on an orphan !"&#xD;
Herrman recognized with horror the voice of Amal..&#xD;
berga. Without farther consideration he fell on the&#xD;
ravisher, who also knew how to handle his~sword,&#xD;
and was not backward at returning the blows. Who&#xD;
can tell how this conflict in the dark might have&#xD;
terminated, had not Herrman's squire with his lance&#xD;
unhorsed their opponent, and extended him sense~&#xD;
less on the earth. "You are saved, fair Amalber..&#xD;
ga," said Herrman, with a faltering voice; "com~.&#xD;

God !" exclaimed the trembling maiden, "you are&#xD;
the knight of Runenburg." "I am." ~~rIthen to yot~&#xD;

At the word honour Herrman shrunk back, but fore..&#xD;
bore' to reply. After a short pause, he coldly asked,&#xD;
"Will you return to Barnberg?" She answered in&#xD;
the affirmative. He ordered his squire to lead her&#xD;
horse by the bridle, and himself rode slowly and&#xD;
silently before to her habitation. Here he drily bade&#xD;
her farewell, and turned his horse without making&#xD;
any inquiry respecting her adventure. But Amal&#xD;
berga embraced his knee with virgin modesty. "No,&#xD;
sir knight," said she, "you shall not depart thus.&#xD;
Come into my house, that I may refresh you with a&#xD;

heart, and he did stay. A delightful sensation thrill~&#xD;
ed his noble frame when he entered Arnalberga's&#xD;
neat apartment.-Here stood the spinning-wheel,&#xD;
there the loom; and on the wall hung a picture of&#xD;
St. Theresa.&#xD;
The lady, agreeably to the ancient custom, loosed&#xD;
the helmet of the knight with )~er own delicate fin-&#xD;
gers, and took it from his head; and when he had&#xD;
thrown his iron gauntlets on the table, she kissed his&#xD;
hand. She then fetched a flagon of wine from a&#xD;
closet, pie(lged him the bowl, and a tear dropped in-&#xD;
to it. Wirrman quaffed the generous beverage1 as&#xD;
indeed he would have (lone, had he been certain~ that&#xD;
the poisonous drug lay at the bottom of the bowl.&#xD;
He soon began to imagine that this wine was really&#xD;
an enchanted potion, for liquid fire seemed ru~n&#xD;
through all his veins: but it was love, whose ~fl ames&#xD;
were again bursting from the ashes. "0 why is not&#xD;
Putt ii here," thought he: "how should I rejoice to&#xD;
fin(l her innocent!" She looked at him so kindly,&#xD;
so tenderly-no, it was absolutely impossible she&#xD;
could be criminal. He then enquired the name of&#xD;
the person from whom he had rescued her. "Did&#xD;
he not tell you himself?" replied Amalberga. "Alas?&#xD;
he is my brother!" "Your brother !-how !-why?"&#xD;
"Pardon me, sir knight, if I beg to be allowed to&#xD;
draw a veil over this horrid secret." " Lady !"&#xD;
cried Herrman, with a voice that betrayed his liro-&#xD;
found emotion, "the moment is arrived in which I&#xD;
must be made acquainted with every thing, and&#xD;
sink confounded at your feet, or hurry away with a&#xD;
heart rent by despair, to rush on the sabres of the&#xD;
infidels."&#xD;
Amalberga started, and looked timidly at him&#xD;
"Lady," continued he, "you must long since have&#xD;
perceived that I love you." At these words the blood&#xD;
suddenly mounted into her pale cheeks. ~'Long&#xD;

subject, whatever may be your astonishment, that I&#xD;
should be acquainted with things which you thought&#xD;

ago you had a forged bill in your pocket-" Amal-&#xD;

added Herrman. "How can I help being so? How&#xD;
should you know it?" "You promised to ask no&#xD;
questions. What was the meaning of this bill?"&#xD;
"I have vowed to St. Theresa that the secret&#xD;
should never escape my lips; but she is a witness to&#xD;
our conversation, and, for the sake of my suspected&#xD;
innocence, she will release me from my VOW: There&#xD;
was an opulent merchant at Nurnberg, in whose&#xD;
name this bill was forged, and who was fortunately&#xD;
an old friend of my father's. He soon discovered&#xD;
the culprit~ my unfortu~iate brother, who, caught in&#xD;
the toils of a selfish woman, had no other means of&#xD;
supporting her extravagance. Out of respect for my&#xD;
father's memory, the merchant forbore to make the&#xD;
transaction public, and merely required compensa-&#xD;
tion to be made in private; but his indulgence was&#xD;
repaid with abuse and scorn. On this he came to&#xD;
me, and complainfMl that he should be necessitated&#xD;
to stigmatize the name of his deceased friend, and at&#xD;
the same time to wound my feelings. I was ex-&#xD;
ceedingly alarm~d. I bad just then embroidered&#xD;
a costly robe, '%~hich it took me two years to finish,&#xD;
in those leisure hours which I could spare from the&#xD;
wheel and the loom. I intended to show off in it at&#xD;
the next tournament But I hesitated not a moment&#xD;
to save the honour of my misguided brother, and to&#xD;
preserve my ancient family from disgrace. I showed&#xD;
my work to the Nurnberger, who was so well pleas~&#xD;

the bill, and took the robe. I put the bill in my&#xD;

said a word about it to my brother, in order to spare&#xD;
his feelings."&#xD;
"What !" exclaimed Herrman, "and this brother,&#xD;
whose reputation you magnanimously preserved,&#xD;
would have carried you off to-day by force?" "The&#xD;
same." "I implore you, fair lady, to explain this&#xD;
riddle also." " Give me your word, that you will&#xD;

perhaps you still remember the time when I was&#xD;
away for two whole weeks." "Well do .1 remem-&#xD;
ber it," replied Herrman, with a sigh. "The abbess&#xD;
of Frauenthal had enticed me into her convent. I&#xD;
considered her as a woman of integrity, and had no&#xD;
conception that her sacred habit could cover such&#xD;
villany. Too soon I found that she was but the&#xD;
bishop's agent, and that, in the asylum of virtue, I&#xD;
was to be delivered up to him either by fraud or&#xD;
force. I was a prisoner. It was not long before he&#xD;
made his appearance, and had recourse to entreaties&#xD;
and threats. I gave myself u p for lost, but my pat..&#xD;
ron saint did not forsake me;! prayed to her most&#xD;
fervently, and she touched the heart of the porteress,&#xD;
who opened the gate of the convent for me one very&#xD;
dark night. I fled to my uncle; andas he has cen.&#xD;

how the bishop had raved when he heard of my es-&#xD;

cape, and sworn he would, nevertheless, sooner or&#xD;
later, accomplish his design. ~My uncle warned me&#xD;
to be on my guard, and even advised me to remove&#xD;
out of the bishop's dominions."&#xD;
"And why did you not follow his advice?" asked&#xD;
Herrman. "I intended," rejoined Amalberga, and&#xD;
a deeper glow crimsoned her cheeks-" I intended,&#xD;
but put it off from day' to day. Must I tell you&#xD;
why?" At these words she raised her downcast&#xD;
eyes, which made a modest confession, and then&#xD;
again became fixed on the ground. "To what risks&#xD;
have ou exposed yourself!" said Herrman, in great&#xD;
agitat~n. "I thought," continued Amalberga, "that&#xD;
the bishop would nevei~ set decency so far at defiance&#xD;
as to carry me by force from my own house in the&#xD;
midst of the town. Then again I took every possi-&#xD;
ble precaution to frustrate his artifices. Against one&#xD;
person only I was not on my guard, and that was my&#xD;
own brother. My heart rejected, with horror, the&#xD;
idea that he was capable of assisting in the execution&#xD;
oI~ the atrocious project of his sister's dishonour.&#xD;
How grievously was I mistaken! Him who was&#xD;
always needy, the bishop has but too easily gained&#xD;
over, and promised him one of his nieces in mar-&#xD;
riage. Yesterday he persuaded me to pay a visit to&#xD;
an aged blind aunt, who lives retired not far from&#xD;
Bamberg. Without the least suspicion, I mounted&#xD;
behind him. The old lady received us most kindly,&#xD;
and entertained us in the best manner she could.&#xD;
When it began to be dusk, I reminded my brother,&#xD;
that it was time to return home. He made various&#xD;
excuses for delaying our departure, so that it was&#xD;
not till 'near midnight that we at length set out; but&#xD;
instead of taking the road to Bamberg, he galloped&#xD;
away, and threatened to murder me f I obstinately&#xD;
persisted in spurning my good fortune, as he termed&#xD;
it. The rest is known to you. Death would soon&#xD;
have been my portion, had not the hand of Provi-&#xD;
dence conducted to me a generous protector.&#xD;
"Worse than death !" muttered Herrman. "0&#xD;

rio!" rejoined Amalberga; "for I had long provided&#xD;
for the worst. Since the affair in the convent, I at..&#xD;
ways carried poison about me. Had every other&#xD;
hope failed, that should have saved me." "For&#xD;
that purpose, was it?" cried Herrman, with trans-&#xD;
port, and would have thrown himself at her feet,&#xD;
when he suddenly imagined that he again heard&#xD;
Puttli's voice, as he read the letter, the horrid con-&#xD;
tents of which drove him from Bamberg. "Lady,"&#xD;
stammered he, "there is but one more weight that&#xD;
presses on my heart. Your frankness gives me&#xD;
courage. The most atrocious circumstance of all&#xD;
yet remains to be explained.'* "The most atro-&#xD;
cious?" 'repeated Amalberga, with astonishment.&#xD;
"I have nothing more to explain." "Have you not&#xD;
murdered a child?" She shuddered. "Surely you&#xD;
cannot be serious!" "Can you deny, that a few&#xD;
days since there was in your pocket a note without&#xD;
signature, doubtless from so~ne favoured lover, who&#xD;
thanked you for having murdered his child, and&#xD;
thereby saved your reputation ?"&#xD;
Herrman was not a little confounded when Amal.&#xD;
berga suddenly burst into a loud laugh. She open-&#xD;
ed a draw and took out a paper,'which she handed&#xD;
to him. "Do you mean this?" said she. "The&#xD;
same." "It is from my old uncle. You are ac-&#xD;
quainted with his satirical turn. When I related&#xD;
to him my adventure in the convent, he was at&#xD;
first highly exasperated, and vowed that he would&#xD;
run the bishop through the body. I reminded him&#xD;
of our poverty and weakness, and that it would be&#xD;
better to say nothing about the matter, than to give&#xD;
scope to malicious tongues, and to draw down on us&#xD;
the vengeance of a powerful enemy. I succeeded&#xD;
in pacifying him; but a few days afterwards he could&#xD;
not withstand.the impulse to write a long and cut-&#xD;
ting satire on the bishop, with the intention of dis-&#xD;
tributing it at court. I trembled for the conse-&#xD;
hluences, and begged him to lend me the piece, as&#xD;
though I wanted to read or copy it, and threw it into&#xD;

the fire. This is what he in this note jocosely calls,&#xD;
murdering his child."&#xD;
It is impossible for language to describe the feels.&#xD;
ings of the knight when he beheld the object of his&#xD;
affections standing before him pure and unimpeacha-&#xD;
ble. sLove and shame bWent his knees, and the vehe-&#xD;
mence of' his passion pleaded in excuse of' the odious&#xD;
suspicion. Th   ollowinrg day he presented Amal-&#xD;
berga as his wife to the bishop, who " grinned horri-&#xD;
bly a ghastly smile."-The old night celebrated the&#xD;
union of' his niece in a spirited epithalamium, and&#xD;
never did a happier pair ascend the bridal bed.-&#xD;
Herrman daily discovered new attractions in his&#xD;
wife. She had but one fault, in common with all&#xD;
her sex-curiosity. She did not rest, till in a happy&#xD;
moment she drew from her husband in what manner&#xD;
he had become so intimately acquainted with the&#xD;
contents of her pocket. He obliged her indeed to&#xD;
promise with an oath, not to reveal the secret; and&#xD;
she faithfully kept her vow for many years. But&#xD;
when her beautiful daughters grew up, Amalberga&#xD;
could not withstand, the impulse which. she felt to&#xD;
communicate it to them. Thus it circulated pri-&#xD;
vrately from one to 'another, till at length it was trans&#xD;
mitted to the present age, in which the ladies may&#xD;
perhaps have still stronger reasons than even those&#xD;
of former times, for not turning their pockets inside&#xD;
out. But, behold! in order to prevent the danger of&#xD;
being betrayed by some malicious Puttli, they su-&#xD;
denly and unanimously came to the resolution-of&#xD;
twearing infuture no pockets at all'.&#xD;

I'll grant I'm hen peck'd, if you please,&#xD;
As Sh-ck or as Socrates.&#xD;
Hold there, replies th' objector siy,&#xD;
Prove first that matrons never lie;&#xD;
Else words are wind. Totell you true,&#xD;
I neither credit them nor you-.&#xD;
No, we'll be judg'd a surer way,'&#xD;
By what they do, not what they say.&#xD;
I'll hold you severally that boast,&#xD;
A supper, at the loser's cost,&#xD;
That if you'll but vouchsafe to try&#xD;
A trick P'll tell you by and by,&#xD;
Send strait for ev'ry wife quite round,&#xD;
One mother's daughter is not found,&#xD;
But what before her husband's face&#xD;
Poi nt-blank his order disobeys.&#xD;
Iro this they one and all consent; .&#xD;
TIhe wager laid, the summons went.&#xD;
Meanwhile he this instruction gives,&#xD;
Pray only gravelystell your wives,&#xD;
Your will and pleasure is t' invite.&#xD;
These friends to a boil'd Pig to-night&#xD;
r he commoner the trick has been,&#xD;
'rhe better chance have you to win: -&#xD;
The treat is mine if they refuse; -&#xD;
But if they boil it, then I lose.&#xD;
The first to whomn the message came&#xD;
Was a well-born and haughty dame;&#xD;
A saucy, independent she,&#xD;
With jomnture and with pin-money,&#xD;
Secur'd by marriage deeds from wants,&#xD;
Without a sep'rate maintenance'.&#xD;
Her loftiness disdain'd to hear&#xD;
Half through her husband's messenger,&#xD;
But cut him short with--How dare he&#xD;
'Mong pot-companions send'for me ?&#xD;
He knows his way, if sober, home,&#xD;
And if he wants me, bid him come..&#xD;
This answer, hastily return'd,&#xD;
Pleas'd all but him that it concern'd;&#xD;
280&#xD;
&#xD;
For each man thought his wife, on trial&#xD;
WXould brighter shine by this denial.&#xD;
The second was a lady gay,&#xD;
Who lov'd to visit, dress, and play;&#xD;
To sparkle in the box or ring,&#xD;
And dance on birth-nights-for the king&#xD;
Whose head was busy wont to be&#xD;
With something else than cookery.&#xD;
She hearing of her husband's name,&#xD;
Tho' much a gentlewoman, came.&#xD;
When half-inform'd of his request,&#xD;
A dish as he desir'd it drest,&#xD;
Quoth madam, with a serious face,&#xD;
Without enquiring what it was,&#xD;
You can't sure for an answer look,&#xD;
Sir, do you take me for your cook?&#xD;
But I must haste a friend to see,&#xD;
Who stays my coming for her tea.&#xD;
So said, that minute out she flew;&#xD;
What could the slighted husband do?&#xD;
His wager lost must needs appear,&#xD;
For none obey that will not hear.&#xD;
The next, f'or housewifery renown'd,&#xD;
A woman notable was own'd,&#xD;
Who hated idleness and airs,&#xD;
And minded family-affairs.&#xD;
Expert at ev'ry thing was she,&#xD;
At needle-work or surgery;&#xD;
Fam'd for her liquors far and near,&#xD;
From richest cordial to small beer.&#xD;
To serve a feast she understood,&#xD;
In English or in foreign mood;&#xD;
Whate'er the wanton taste could choose,&#xD;
In sauces, kickshaws, and ragous,&#xD;
She spar'd for neither cost nor pain,&#xD;
Her welcome guests to entertain.&#xD;
Her husband fair accosts her thus:&#xD;
To-night these friends will sup with us&#xD;
She answer'd with a smile, my dear,&#xD;
Your friends are always welcome there.--&#xD;

But we desire a pig; and pray,&#xD;
You'll boil it.---Boil it, do you say ?&#xD;
I hope you'll give me leave to know&#xD;
My bus'ness better, sir, than so. .&#xD;
Why! ne'er in any book was yet&#xD;
Found such a whimsical receipt;.&#xD;
My dressing none need be afraid of,&#xD;
But such a dish was never heard of.&#xD;
P'll roast it nice,-but shall not boil it;&#xD;
Let those that know no better spoil it&#xD;
Her husband cry'd, for all myboast,&#xD;
I own the wager fairly lost.&#xD;
And other wives besides my love,&#xD;
Or I'm mistaken much, may prove&#xD;
More changeable than this to me,&#xD;
To shew their pride in housewifery. .&#xD;
Now the poor wretch who next him sat,&#xD;
Felt his own heart go pit-a-pat,&#xD;
For well he knew his spouse's way;&#xD;
Her spirit brook'd not to obey;&#xD;
And never yet was in the wrong:&#xD;
He told her, with a smiling tongue,&#xD;
Where, and on what his friends would feas&#xD;
And how the dainty should be drest.&#xD;
To-night ? quoth in a passion she;&#xD;
No, sirs, to-niight it cannot be.&#xD;
And was it a boil'd pig you said?&#xD;
You and your friends sure are not mad!&#xD;
The kitchen is the proper sphere,&#xD;
Where none but females should appear:&#xD;
And cooks their orders, by your leave, -&#xD;
Always from mistresses receive.&#xD;
Boil it! was ever such an ass!&#xD;
Pray, what would you desire for sauce?&#xD;
If any servant in my pay&#xD;
Dare dress a pig that silly way,&#xD;
In spite of any whim of' your's,&#xD;
I'll turn them quickly out of doors; -&#xD;
For no such thing, nay, never frown, .&#xD;
Where I am mistress shall be done.&#xD;

&#xD;
Each woman wise her husband rules&#xD;
Passive obedience is for fools.&#xD;
This case was quickly judg'd. Behold,&#xD;
A fair one, of a softer mould;&#xD;
Good humour sparkled in her' eye,&#xD;
And unaffected leasantry.&#xD;
So mild and sweet she enter'd in,&#xD;
Her spouse thought certainly to win.&#xD;
Pity such golden hopes should fail,&#xD;
Soon as she heard the appointed tale;&#xD;
My dear, I know not, I protest, -&#xD;
Whet her in earnest or in jest&#xD;
So strange a supper you demand;&#xD;
Howe'er, I'll not disputing stand,&#xD;
But do't as freely as you bid it,&#xD;
Prove but that ever woman did it.&#xD;
This cause, by general consent,&#xD;
Was lost for want of precedent.&#xD;
Thus each deny'd a sev'ral way,&#xD;
But all agreed to disobey.&#xD;
One only dame did yet remain,&#xD;
Who downright honest was and plain:&#xD;
If now and then her voice she tries,&#xD;
'I'is not for rule, but exercise.&#xD;
Unus'd her lords commands to slight,&#xD;
Yet sometimes pleading for the right,&#xD;
She made her little wisdom go&#xD;
Farther than wiser women do.&#xD;
Her husband tells her, looking grave,&#xD;
A roasting pig I boil'd would have;&#xD;
And, to prevent all pro and con,&#xD;
I must insist to have it done.&#xD;
Says she, my dearest, shall your wife,&#xD;
Get a nick-name to last for life ?&#xD;
If you resolve to spoil it, do,&#xD;
But I desire you'll eat it too;&#xD;
For tho' 'tis boil'd, to hinder squabble,&#xD;
I shall not, will not sit at table.&#xD;
She spoke, and her good man alone&#xD;
Found he had neither lost nor won,&#xD;

&#xD;
THE GAUGER OF GARSTANG&#xD;
Some thirty years have flown away&#xD;
Since Garstang had a gauger wise,&#xD;
Who softly in his tomb is laid&#xD;
Where death at last has closed his eyes;&#xD;
For well, I trow, the smuggler bold&#xD;
He followed in their nightly scenes-&#xD;
And well he knew the mountain fires,&#xD;
And what the musket's rattle means.&#xD;
Heav'n rest his soul! whole butts of gin,&#xD;
He'd taken from these miscreant fellows,&#xD;
A drop of grog he lov'd himself,&#xD;
And swigg'd away, as people tell us&#xD;
But soft! my muse, he's silent now,&#xD;
Dry is his tongue, now turning dusty;&#xD;
And like the empty cask, I guess,&#xD;
His bones are smelling rather musty.&#xD;
~254&#xD;
&#xD;
So fairly parted stakes. The rest&#xD;
Fell on the wag that caused the jest:&#xD;
VVouId your wife hoi'. it? Let us see&#xD;
Hold there-you did not lay with me.&#xD;
You find, in spite 'f all you boasted,&#xD;
Your pigs are fatted to be roasted.&#xD;
The wager's lost, no more contend,&#xD;
But take this counsel from a friend:&#xD;
Boast not your empire, if you prize it,&#xD;
For happiest he that never tries it.&#xD;
Wives u nprovok'd think not of sway;&#xD;
Without commanding they obey.&#xD;
But if your dear, ones take the field,&#xD;
Resolve at once to win or yield.&#xD;
For heaven no medium ever gave&#xD;
Betwixt a sov'reign and a slave.&#xD;

&#xD;
One night he sallied forth for fun,&#xD;
As he had got some information;&#xD;
A smuggler would convey some gin&#xD;
Across a heath within his station.&#xD;
He met the smuggler, took his gin,&#xD;
With half an hour's pretended fighting;&#xD;
For many other tubs of gin&#xD;
The smuggler had that night for righting.&#xD;
The battle o'er, he looked around,&#xD;
When lo! a fog comes quickly spreading&#xD;
Across the heath, and nought was seen,&#xD;
But just the ground that he was treading;&#xD;
[n ditch and bog he scrambled long,&#xD;
And, tired the tub of gin to carry,&#xD;
He seats himself upon its end,&#xD;
And waits to see the ev'ning starry.&#xD;
In vain he waits-still darker grew&#xD;
The dismal night, which loud was howling,&#xD;
So on the heath he took his bed,&#xD;
And patient heard the tempest rolling.&#xD;
But ere he sunk his head in sleep,&#xD;
With gin his heart with joy was soaring,&#xD;
Then stretching out his mouth and hands,&#xD;
He set up a tremendous snoring.&#xD;
Some colliers early in the morn,&#xD;
Along the heath to work were going,&#xD;
And found, by chance, the gauger drunk,&#xD;
Hard with his mouth for wind a-blowing,&#xD;
Mid, lest he should die with the cold,&#xD;
Into a coal-pit deep they took him,&#xD;
And placed him, snoring, in a part,&#xD;
Where, working, they could overlook him.&#xD;
He s1~ept some hours-then faintly lifts&#xD;
His peepers sad and wild around him,&#xD;
When all the colliers, black as imps,&#xD;
With horror and dismay confound hint&#xD;

tie thought he'd pass'd from life to death,&#xD;
And by pot-luek was with the devil,&#xD;
So he address'd them, one and all,&#xD;
With look and tone both wond'rous civil.&#xD;
Then eyeing well the ugliest man,&#xD;
Who grin n'd most horribly with joy,&#xD;
"'I hope an honest gauger here,&#xD;
Your highness never will annoy.&#xD;

But, mister devil, if' it please ye,&#xD;

I'll do my best, great sire, to please ye&#xD;
Whatever place in Hell ye like,&#xD;
With honest heart I will endeavour&#xD;
To fill my part with burning zeal, ,&#xD;
And merit your good word for ever,"&#xD;
The gauger spoke--when peals of fun, .&#xD;
Burst from the devils rang'd around him;&#xD;
Their sooty looks and gleaming eyes&#xD;
Were quite sufficient to astound him.&#xD;
He scream'd aloud with abject fear,&#xD;
" Oh spare me, mister devil, spare me!&#xD;
Let not your cinders burn me up,&#xD;
Let not your angry talons tear me!"&#xD;
" Well," quoth the Devil, "swear by me,&#xD;

But be to him a gauger friendly." -&#xD;
*I swear, I swear, by heav'n and earth,&#xD;
And all your brothers at me staring,&#xD;
On ev'ry smuggler's gin or rum&#xD;
My hand shall ever be forbearing."&#xD;
" Well, then, go home," the collier cried,&#xD;
" From this thou wilt become some wiser,&#xD;
And from this time be it thy pride,&#xD;
To call Old Nick thy Supervisor."&#xD;
