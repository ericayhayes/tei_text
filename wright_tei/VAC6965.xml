Into this conversation. You have wronged&#xD;

thus sh interrupted the planter.      .&#xD;
He reserved his composure, for a weeder.&#xD;
"ell, I will not speak of him. There is&#xD;
one, however, whom I will not yet name, who&#xD;
has an ample fortune, almost equal to- my&#xD;
own. One who, to my certain knowledge,&#xD;
loves you devotedly.  My proposition Is,&#xD;
that you marry him, and receive your fortune&#xD;
and your freedom from my guardianship, so&#xD;
distasteful to you, at once. The dismal two&#xD;

CHAPTER III.       r&#xD;
A pretty picture! What could be prettier?&#xD;
The master-pieee of Deity-peerless woman&#xD;
--lone accepted.&#xD;
It was a schooner yacht, with bows as sharp&#xD;
as a woodsman's wedge, with hull long and low&#xD;
upon the water, bioa in the beam, tut taper.&#xD;
ing.away in the counter until her stern, at the&#xD;
waters edge and below it, was as sharp as her&#xD;
bow. Herlong spars,raking until they looked&#xD;
as if they must fall over the stern, were ev-&#xD;
ered with an immense spread of snowy can-&#xD;
vas, which, light s the breeze was--scarce&#xD;
enough to ripple the green waters of the&#xD;
coast - still drove her steadily over them,&#xD;
From the gaff of her main-sail fluttered the&#xD;
starry flag of a then undissevered Union-from&#xD;
th3 lofty truck of her foretop mast, a flag:of&#xD;
crimson silk was waving, upon which, in gold-&#xD;
en letters, the name of ADsEL could be seen.&#xD;
The same name, in golden letters, wreathed&#xD;
with carved flowers, appeared upon the stern&#xD;
of this beautiful vessel. She was sihsh a craft&#xD;
as a true sailor's eye could gaze upon un-&#xD;
wearied for hours. No fault could be traced&#xD;
in hull or spar, in canvas or in rig. She was,&#xD;
-fore and aft" in rig, with no square saIls&#xD;
aloft, but a very long square-sail yard lay&#xD;
athwart her rails4ust forward of the foremast,&#xD;
and furled to i was a squaresail which, when&#xD;
the wind wne abaft thne beam, would be of&#xD;
vast service in adding to her speed.&#xD;
We have glanced at her es he" walked the&#xD;
waters like a thing of life,"and now we will&#xD;
look inboard, and sechow thingsappear there,.&#xD;
Upon a deek -as white as were the sails&#xD;
above it, some ten or twelve neatly-dressed&#xD;
seamen lounged lazily ; for the sails were&#xD;
trimmed and there was no work to do. The&#xD;
eraft evidently was a peaceful one, from the&#xD;
number of her crew ; although amidships, on&#xD;
a railway pivot, a long brass twelve-pounder&#xD;
shone as brightly qs if it had been made of&#xD;
gold,&#xD;
Aft, near the helmsman, stood a man who,&#xD;
by 'his dress, was evidently an gffleer ; by his&#xD;
looks and bearing, ever inch a man and&#xD;

"Boy and man, sir, on the sea for over for-&#xD;
ty Years, I have learned my duty too welt to&#xD;
ever ask  myf captain what port ie i going&#xD;
to, or what he is going for," said Perkins,&#xD;
quietly . " I knew your aIther's son too well&#xD;
to think is cruise would lead in a dishonora,&#xD;
tle port, therefore cared not where we were&#xD;
thound, or what for."&#xD;
"Thank   ou,f"r your confidence,Mr. Per-&#xD;
kins ; but it is fitting that. you should know&#xD;
the object of my running into this place, for&#xD;
I shall need both your advice and aid. Up-&#xD;
-on -youn and Nathan I know I can depend, as&#xD;
old a m1 ti ue friends."&#xD;
" Sartaiu," said Nathan, gravely.  "&#xD;
"Soit time Rine ," continued Morley, "af-.&#xD;

f'ore she sv i to tl-d aid launched, I took a&#xD;
pleasure- trip oth, more to observe the man-&#xD;

the chill of a Northern winter, than anything&#xD;
else. Chiance threw rue into the company of&#xD;
the very plaiter ihosechlateau we can dimly&#xD;

ciprocatel by inviting me to spend a few&#xD;

see rdantation life through my own eyes, and&#xD;
not through the medi'mi of some book Writy ai&#xD;
in the flieke- in light of real or fanaticism.&#xD;
But little did I note of plantation life after I&#xD;
got there, though I was forced to join the&#xD;
muter in the bhumti'ng and fishing-trips which&#xD;
helanned for my amusement. I found with'&#xD;
in that chateau a youin  orphan ward of the&#xD;
planter, nu heiress to an imnonse fortune......&#xD;
neu who wus more 'beautiful than any Leing&#xD;
1'ever saw or dreamed of. To see her was to&#xD;
love her. Site loved mes in return. Wha&#xD;
wonder? The planter had, until ray visit&#xD;
kept her utterl 'excluded from the society o&#xD;
gentlemen, and evea of ladies-gu-rded he&#xD;
with a jealous care which I mistook for kind&#xD;
ness, until I was undeceived by his conduct&#xD;
when he perceived the state of feeline which&#xD;
existed between his ward and myself. H&#xD;
first hinted to me that she was eng~aed to b'&#xD;
married to his brother-a sottish villain, twice&#xD;
other a-ea soon as she arrived at her tnajot&#xD;

'I removed to the house of another pltan&#xD;

still continued my visits, avowing myself as&#xD;
suitor for Miss Dumesle's hand.&#xD;
"Thenc ame an open ruptere'rith hitm&#xD;

his lcsceution, after a final initetview wit&#xD;
&#xD;
her, I left for the North, launched the yacht.&#xD;
fitted her out, manned her, and here we are."&#xD;
"I swow I ef it h-n't as good us a novel !&#xD;
said Nathan, who iad listened breathlessly to&#xD;
the story of his captain. "I mind, when I&#xD;
was t boy, of readiu the 'Three S1"aniards,"&#xD;
he continued," and this is just like'ei, made&#xD;
and provided we carry off the gal."&#xD;
"What do you propose to do, captain? I&#xD;
am ready to obey any order yon can gI e&#xD;
and the crew, to a man, a-e witi~ you. Nver&#xD;
was a captain more popular than you, sir. 1&#xD;
do not say it in flattery."&#xD;
"I know you would not stoop to flattery,&#xD;
Perkins. It was to consider our Lest course&#xD;
of action that I called you to counsel with me.&#xD;
Whether to run in and boldly demand and&#xD;
carry off the lady, in spite of any resistance&#xD;
that might be offered, or, by lying off until&#xD;
night, run in, effect, as I cn, a meeting with&#xD;
her, and get her on board without the knowl-&#xD;
edge of her guardian. Then away t a hap-&#xD;
pier region than that in which she dwells,"&#xD;
"Could you pilot the yacLt into the har&#xD;
bor at night, sir ?"&#xD;
"Yes, 1 think se, easily. For often I have&#xD;
been in and out in a fishing-sloop which be-&#xD;
longs to the planter ; and if a beacon is lit.&#xD;
which I lioje to see to-night, and have seen&#xD;
before-it is in Adele's window-I know I&#xD;
could go in."'&#xD;
"Then, sir, since you ask my advice, .&#xD;
would say, lie off until to-night. Blood is&#xD;
precious, and should not ho aed needlessly ;&#xD;
there will be less risk of bloodshed at night&#xD;
- than in the d ty-timie."&#xD;
" True, Perkins. Blood is the wine of life,&#xD;
given us by Him whose law is, that it shall&#xD;
not be wasted. We will lie off until to-&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, captain," said a young&#xD;
man, the second oeffier of the sehooer, ap-&#xD;
f earing at the cabin-door, " if I intrude, but&#xD;
r I thought it my duty to report that a small&#xD;

t rough wiadiug avenues of orange and em-&#xD;
on trees, amongst acacias, myrtles, roses, and&#xD;
many another sweet-scented flower, they hur-&#xD;
ried, caring little for the blossoms they trod&#xD;
upon or sped past,&#xD;
Passing from th first garden, through a&#xD;
m-rrower gateway to the second--whieh was&#xD;
devoted more to vegetables and fiuits than&#xD;
flowers-they quickly reached the watereside&#xD;
amiust a grove of orange ttees.&#xD;
Light as were their fear-winged' footsteps,&#xD;
o. b car was sufficiently on the alert to hear&#xD;
them, and the slender form of Jarold Mor-&#xD;
ley was seen emerging from the densershad-&#xD;
ows of the grove.&#xD;
One bound, and he had Adele in his arms.&#xD;
Heart beat against heart, lip met lip-aid if&#xD;
there is the bliss of Heaven known on earth,&#xD;
those two congenial souls knew that bliss&#xD;
twen and there.&#xD;
Zella stood trembling with excitement ; her&#xD;
great dark eyes filled with tears, looking as&#xD;
if she, too, longed to east her arms about that&#xD;
graceful form, and pour out the passionate&#xD;
felings of gratitude which she  ared not&#xD;
utter.&#xD;
" We must not delay, Adele," said Hagrold,&#xD;
after the first embrace, and the first words of&#xD;
love had been spoken. Then seeing Zella, he&#xD;
said. in a tone of kindness, as he reached out&#xD;
his hand&#xD;
"My good Zella, I am glad to see you&#xD;
hero; you have taken good care of my sweet&#xD;
Adale."&#xD;
The quadroon took his extended hand; she&#xD;
tried to. speak, but could not. Kneeling&#xD;
down, she kissed his hand over and over&#xD;
again, and burst into tears.&#xD;

magnificent cabin, where everything blazed&#xD;
with splendor.r&#xD;
A table, laden with" enke, and fruit, and&#xD;
Wine, seemed to have been purposely spread&#xD;
for them. Harold knew there con d be no&#xD;
ertor, that his Adele would surely sup there&#xD;
that night.&#xD;
"Wiat think you of your ocean-home, my   F&#xD;
Adele ?" asked Harold, as he wat~lhed the&#xD;
lovely girl standing mute with surprise and&#xD;
pleasure.&#xD;
"I hare read of fairy palaces-this is one,"&#xD;
she said, at last. ..&#xD;
" And ycu are the fairy queen of it, 'lhe said, 3&#xD;
With a smile. "What think you of it, Zella ?"&#xD;
" It is like heaven; and you ,are its chief&#xD;
angel," said Zelle-. Then blushing, as if she&#xD;
f It she had spoken toobodly, she said: "I&#xD;
would die here." -&#xD;
"'r hope Heath is a long way from us all,'&#xD;
said Harold  "But, AdeleI have a sur-&#xD;
prise for you. Not a soul on board has ever&#xD;
seen what I am about to show you. I have a=&#xD;
picture which' I vowed never to unvaii to&#xD;
other eyes than my own, until' you were here&#xD;
to look upon it. Come aft am moment."&#xD;
They proceeded to the after-part of time'&#xD;

of purple velvet, flecked with gold. These,&#xD;
running upon a rod overhead, by simple pul.&#xD;
lies, concealed on either side, could be drawn&#xD;
apart.&#xD;
Harold drew them apart, ant revealed a&#xD;
painting which brought a cry of wonder andy&#xD;
gladness from Adele-a sigh of pleasure fro&#xD;
poor Zelha  It was a Southern scene-the ±&#xD;
gure, fulliength. A young man was arrang- '&#xD;
ing a wreath of orange-blossoms, as he sat by&#xD;
the side of a lovely girl, and another girl of&#xD;
ueenly form was pluokiig the blossoms from&#xD;
the trees and casting them down before him.&#xD;
The portraits were life-like-the painting&#xD;
true to Nature. Tie young man was Harold&#xD;
Mobley - he wrought the wreath for Adele&#xD;
Dimesle --she who plucked the flowers was&#xD;
Zeif, the quadroon.&#xD;
"Was that painted by your own hand, my&#xD;
Darold ?" asked Adele, as eje stood and gazed&#xD;
upon it.&#xD;
" No; it was fainted i an artist friend,&#xD;

"Yes, master cap'n, if urm good pay I"&#xD;

Nll times. There is a doubloon to commence&#xD;
with. If y'u are faithful to me, every day&#xD;
y u shall have another !"&#xD;
Pedro was so astonished that be stopped&#xD;
rowi gand looked at the doubloon full thirty&#xD;
cecoids before Ie reached out his hand to&#xD;
raise it from the thwart u on which Gustave&#xD;
laid it,. lie even bit the c a to see if it was&#xD;
goad.&#xD;
"Es oro puro !" he muttered in Spanish.&#xD;
Then looking at G ustavo,with hiscunning eyes,&#xD;
he asked : "Does Massa Cal i' meai he give&#xD;
Pedro a doubloon cv'ry day he work for urn"&#xD;
"Yes; and this day I pay in advance, as&#xD;
you see!"&#xD;
"Good! Me work for Massa Cap'n till he&#xD;
so want me any more&#xD;
And Pedro again resumed his ears, which&#xD;
be rowed with a skill and case which betoken-&#xD;
ed long experience.&#xD;
The boat was now within a half-cable's&#xD;
length of the yacht. Gustave motioned to&#xD;
'Pedro to cease rowing, and with a turn of the&#xD;
rudder, threw the boat broadside to the ves-&#xD;
sel, so that lie could peep front behind his&#xD;
curtains at her, without himself being seen.&#xD;
"Didl you see the owner of that vessel when&#xD;
you were on board, Pedro ?" asked Gustave.&#xD;
"Oh, yes! Me see urn - me see um all.&#xD;
Me been on board four, five times !"&#xD;
Did you see any indies ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Massa Cap'n ! One so han'sum, she&#xD;

"She would make you a good wife, eh,&#xD;

expresion of the mulatto's features, seeking&#xD;
ri much in them for a reply as he would in&#xD;
' hse rdsewhich came from his lips.&#xD;
"A-wife? Por San Antonio. Mass Cap'n,&#xD;
it I hadl her for wife, I wouldn't change places&#xD;
viirlthe capitan-gneral ! No, not me !"&#xD;
And the face of the muhito all aglow, and&#xD;
his eyes sparkling, told how the how blood&#xD;
through his veins at the hqught. -&#xD;
*  * "   qme faithfully, and yon taal! have&#xD;

"I believe I can trust you !" said Gustave.&#xD;
"And I will tell youn  ,cret ahout ZellaI"&#xD;
" Zella ! Yes, thatsh er nae I" said the&#xD;
mulatto, and line pointed toward the yacht, to&#xD;
indicate whom he meant.&#xD;
"She is my slave, and ran away from me&#xD;
in Georgia. If you serve ie faithfully when&#xD;
I get her back, I will give her to you I"&#xD;
"Me serve you ! Me go to devil for you,&#xD;
Massa Cap'n, s'pose yti do that !"&#xD;
"Well, it is a bargain, and there's m hand&#xD;
upon itI"&#xD;
And Gustave, artistoerat that lie was,&#xD;
reached out his hand, and grasped the thin,&#xD;
bony hand of the boatman. The grip of the&#xD;
latter was like the pressure of a vice -his&#xD;
hand, though the climate was so mild, was as&#xD;
cold as ice.         -&#xD;
"You are strong !" said Gustave as, with&#xD;
an involuntary shudder, he drew back to his&#xD;
seat.&#xD;
"All same like tiger !" said Pedro, with a&#xD;
cunning smile.&#xD;
"Very good-I like you, Pedro, and shall&#xD;
depend upon you ! -Now    row me slowly&#xD;
around tIe yacht. 1 want to see nIl that I can&#xD;
without being seen !"&#xD;
The boatman obeyed orders, and pulled&#xD;
gently along the smooth waters of the lhar-&#xD;
bor, until lie had eomipleted thie circuit, and&#xD;
again lay upon his oars between the vessel&#xD;
and the city. During the circuit, Gustave&#xD;
had looked anxiously to see the faesaof some&#xD;
of those wlhon I knew; but to persons were&#xD;
on deck but some of the crew, of whom he had&#xD;
no remembrance.&#xD;
But as his boat stopped, when Pedro cans-&#xD;
ed rowing, lie saw Perkins come on deck and&#xD;
heard him give some order. In a moment a&#xD;
boat was lowered from the davits, and a crew&#xD;
sprang into it.&#xD;
Gustave drew the awning-curtains close, and&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
" I know von will chide inc for my folly,"&#xD;
said Adele, to Harold, when they met at the&#xD;
breakfast-table on board the yacht in the&#xD;
morning which followed their last visit to the&#xD;
masquerade, "but I must tell you of a dream&#xD;
-a fearful dream! which I had lastnight.&#xD;
I know that you laugh at all things superna-&#xD;
tural, and disbelieve in ominous dreams, yet&#xD;
this dream lies like a leaden weight upon my&#xD;
heart&#xD;
"Dreams, my love, are only the effect of a&#xD;
nervousness felt before sleep; and whatever&#xD;
wild, nervous fears or fancies you feel before&#xD;
you sleep, form the burden of what you sup-&#xD;
pose to be dreams. The truth is, that they&#xD;
are not dreams-they are the same fancies felt&#xD;
while you are in a semi-somnolent state, half-&#xD;
awake and half-asleep. But I will not laugh&#xD;
at you ; tell me your supposed dream ; and,&#xD;
afterward, we will both laugh when it fails in&#xD;
reality to come to pass."&#xD;
knoww I was sadly nervous when I retir-&#xD;
ed," said Adele. "It was a long time before I&#xD;
slept. When I did, I thought my spirit was&#xD;
disembodied, and that I was permitted in spirit&#xD;
to sweep through the air and see all things as&#xD;
with my mortal eyes. Half-enchanted with&#xD;
joy, I flew over beautiful gardens, full of fra-&#xD;
grant flowers ; over lakes which glittered like&#xD;
molten silver ; over vine-embowered  cot-&#xD;
tages and splendid palaces ; over streams&#xD;
which bubbled and gurgled over sands of gold,&#xD;
and through groves where myriads of birds&#xD;
sung in wild yet dulcet harmony.&#xD;
"I was delighted. I flew over broad fields&#xD;
of cane, and rice, and coffee ; -I looked down&#xD;
upon groves of orange, lemon, and lime ; I&#xD;
rested on the emerafd-crowned palm; I pluck-&#xD;
ed the ehiramoyft from its stem, and placed&#xD;
it, melting in its juicy ripeness, in my&#xD;
mouth.&#xD;
"Suddenly I saw a votante like that in&#xD;
which we ride, and it halted by the ruins of&#xD;
an old palace. There was but one person in&#xD;
it. I hastened toward it, and came so near&#xD;
that Icould see thatyou were in it, andalone-&#xD;
none but Benito, the driver, near you. You&#xD;
seemed to be curiously looking at the old&#xD;
ruins. And now, when I wished to join you,&#xD;
my wings, hitherto so airy and so swift, seem-&#xD;
ed to fail me, and I remained like one anchor-&#xD;
ed in the air.&#xD;
" While I fretted to be free, again, as be-&#xD;
fere. I saw another volante driving toward the&#xD;
spot where you were. It stopped behind a&#xD;
half-ruined wall, and from it descended Gus-&#xD;
tave Ilenderson,. With him was a man, whose&#xD;
dark, ferocious look made rme shudder. In&#xD;
Ids hand, this man carried a dagger. Hen-&#xD;
&#xD;
derson pointed toward you, and stealthily,&#xD;
like a serpent gliding toward its prey, the&#xD;
murderous-looking man crept toward you.&#xD;
"I knew his intention--I struggled to fly to&#xD;
your side-alas ! I was helpless ! I tried to&#xD;
shriek out a warning to you, but my lips&#xD;
were sealed with fear and horror. Closer,&#xD;
closer crept the assassin, while you, heedless&#xD;
of danger, plucked fruit from the trees which&#xD;
grew amid the ruins.&#xD;
"Oh, the agony which I felt ! Now he was&#xD;
close to you, only one tree--a huge palm--&#xD;
between him and yourself. You paused be-&#xD;
neath its shade--he was close to your back--&#xD;
his hand holding the glitteringsteel upraised!&#xD;
With one fearful effort, I broke the dreadful&#xD;
seal of silence, and shrieked:&#xD;
"'Harold! Harold ! beware!'&#xD;
"I woke, and found myself cold as ice with&#xD;
terror, and trembling from head to foot.&#xD;
Now, do not blame me, dear Harold, if I tell&#xD;
you that I do think this dream is ominous;&#xD;
nor chide me when I beg you, for my sake,&#xD;
not in any way to expose yourself on shore.&#xD;
I know what a base, treacherous, revengeful&#xD;
wretch is that Gustave Henderson. He is not&#xD;
a brave and open enemy ; the assassin's knife&#xD;
-the poisoned cup-either would he use to&#xD;
rid himself of one whom he hates and fears !"&#xD;
"There is the foundation of your dream,"&#xD;
said Harold, with a smile.  " before you&#xD;
slept, knowing his characteira t husaud fears&#xD;
of what he might do torments) your n ind.&#xD;
Was it not so ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Harold ; yet I know I slept soundly&#xD;
when I dreamed that dream."&#xD;
"You think so, love ; but never mind, let&#xD;
us try to "1o justice to the breakfast which&#xD;
our good Nathan has provided for us. By&#xD;
the way, do you believe in dreams. Nathan ?"&#xD;
"Do I, capting? You might jist as well&#xD;
ask me of I believed in the Gospel of Saint&#xD;
Luke !" replied Nathan, who had listened,&#xD;
open-eyed and open-mouthed, to the narra-&#xD;
tion of Adele. "Yes, capting ; I do believe&#xD;
in dreams. I dreamed, the only time I ever&#xD;
was in love, that my gal gin me the mitten ;&#xD;
and sure enough she did, the very next time&#xD;
I axed her to go to meetim' with me. She&#xD;
said she'd found better company; and she&#xD;
went and took up with Ben Smith, the shoe-&#xD;
maker, and she's been his lap-stone ever&#xD;
since !"&#xD;
Both Harold and Adele laughed at Nathan's&#xD;
story ; but Zella remained silent and glopmy.&#xD;
"What is the matter, Zella, asked Harold,&#xD;
kindly.&#xD;
"I, too, have had a dream, kind Master&#xD;
.Harold," she said ';but I will ndt tell it to&#xD;
be laughed at. Only I beg you to beware of&#xD;
Gustave Henderson. lie is a bad man, and&#xD;
dangerous, because he works in the dark."&#xD;

while lie hired him to follow and keep within  Harold looked again at the handwriting on&#xD;

acquaintance in the city,'and would look at lane.&#xD;
their registers to see if he has not arrived."  "Do you know where the Bishop's Garden&#xD;

mounted his mule, casting, at the same, an riage.&#xD;

exchanged which Harold did not notice.&#xD;
When the volane which contained Harold           CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;

From  hotel to hotel --- Spanish, French,  Several times he thought he would'order&#xD;

IIiLLIARE HENDERSON, OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Upon arriving at the place where he had&#xD;
left his volante, Harold found it thre-the&#xD;
white niule standing tied asLUenito had left it.&#xD;
He shouted for Benito, but neither answer&#xD;
nor man caine. But the driver, who had&#xD;
Lrouglht Nathan, hearing the shouts, came&#xD;
and said .&#xD;
" Seor, if you seek Benito, von will not&#xD;
find himlire. About twenty minutes ago,&#xD;
he and a large, fit shy man came running out&#xD;
of the garden, and taking a vu/ante which was&#xD;
fastened just before mine, turned it, and near-&#xD;
ly upseitmng my vo/ante in passing, drove off&#xD;
at a gallop toward the city."&#xD;
"The murderers! Even Benito was in the&#xD;
plot,'' said Harold. Then turning to Nathan,&#xD;
he added : "We must lose n time-can you&#xD;
act as calacecro, Nathan? I will get into this&#xD;
man's roan/c, and drive to the governor's pal-&#xD;
nee. Can you follow with the vo/ante that be-&#xD;
longs to Benito ?"&#xD;
I reckon I can ; leastwise, I can try," said&#xD;
Nathan, turning the white mule and prepar-&#xD;
ing to mount, while Harold went on the other&#xD;
vo/ante ; and tossing its driver a piece of gold,&#xD;
told him to drive with all possible speed to&#xD;
the governor's palace.&#xD;
&#xD;
CIIAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
When Harold arrived at the palace and sent&#xD;
heis card to the governor-general, he was in-&#xD;
stattly admitted.&#xD;
Upon his relation of the attempt to asstassi-&#xD;
nate hin, and the death of the man who at-,&#xD;
tempted to commit the deed, the governor in-&#xD;
stantly ordered one of the officers of his guard&#xD;
to take a file of men to scour the entire neigh-&#xD;
borhood, and to arrest any persons whom&#xD;
they might find there, also to bring the body&#xD;
in for recognition. And when Harold told&#xD;
him whom he supposed to be the instigator&#xD;
of the attack ; and under what false name he&#xD;
thought he had registered himself, the gor-&#xD;
rnor at once gave him an officer and a guard&#xD;
of soldiers, with orders to arrest Henderson&#xD;
and Benito wherever they might be found-&#xD;
itt the same time ordering the volante and mule&#xD;
of Benito to be detained in the government&#xD;
stables.&#xD;
"If they are caught, the garote is their des-&#xD;
tiny !".said the governor. "We have an oe-&#xD;
easional murder in the night-time," he added ;&#xD;
but never since I have ruled upon the isl-&#xD;
and, has such a bold and desperate crime been&#xD;
attempted in the day-time. Let the criminals&#xD;
be secured, and an example shall be made&#xD;
which will strike terror to the black hearts of&#xD;
all others who are like them in disposition."'&#xD;
Harold at once went with the officer and&#xD;
guard to the Posada de la Europa, and inquir-&#xD;
d for General Weston.&#xD;
"lie returned less titan an hour ago, paid&#xD;
&#xD;
his bill, took his baggage, and went away,&#xD;
senior," replied the landlord.&#xD;
"Did he leave word whither he was going ?"&#xD;
asked the officer.&#xD;
"No, senor," replied the landlord. "iIe&#xD;
seemed in great haste ; though but last night&#xD;
he said he should stay some weeks."&#xD;
"Which way did the rolante go which car-&#xD;
ried him ?" asked the officer,&#xD;
"Down toward the harbor," replied the&#xD;
landlord.&#xD;
"We will get him yet, senor," said the offi-&#xD;
cer to Harold. "his excellencythe govern-&#xD;
or-general, will doubtless offer a reward for&#xD;
both the fugitives, and they cannot long es-&#xD;
cape our vigilance."&#xD;
Ihen taking a careful description of Hen-&#xD;
derson and Benito, the officer returned to the&#xD;
palace to report.&#xD;
Harold started to return to his vessel, re-&#xD;
questing the officer to say to the governor&#xD;
that he would return to the palace in a, short&#xD;
time with Nathan, to give any evidence which&#xD;
might be required when the body of the as-&#xD;
sassin was brought in. -&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
In a short time, Harold, with Nathan by&#xD;
his side, stood once more in the cabin of his&#xD;
beautiful yacht.&#xD;
"I never will laugh at your dreams again,&#xD;
dear Adele," said lie, as lie pressed his lips&#xD;
upon her brow. "To your thoughtfulness&#xD;
and Nathan's courage, I owe my life."&#xD;
"Then you have been attacked ?"&#xD;
And Adele, as she said this, turned pale.&#xD;

them, beneath a palm. hnd you seen the&#xD;

you gave him, shot the vile assassin down at&#xD;
the moment when his hand was raised to drive&#xD;
his weapon to my heart,"&#xD;
"Thank Heaven ! O Nathan ! I know not&#xD;
how to thank you-how to reward you!"&#xD;
cried Adele, grasping the old man's band.&#xD;
"In saving his life, you have saved my own."&#xD;
"Then I've got all the pay I ask for in this&#xD;
world," said Nathan. "I only wish I could&#xD;
have killed t'other one, too."&#xD;
"Was it Henderson that he killed?" asked&#xD;
Adele.&#xD;
"No-merely a tool of his," replied liar-&#xD;
old. "The chief villain has escaped, for the&#xD;
time; but the authorities are after him, and&#xD;
his life is forfeited if he is captured."&#xD;
"I hope they will secure him," replied&#xD;
Adele. "While such a villain lives, and,&#xD;

Perhaps  our can so serve m that I can&#xD;
take miiyself off, and reward you yet more,"&#xD;
said Gustave.&#xD;
"1 do not understand, your excellency.&#xD;
One thing is certain, the sooner you are away&#xD;
t he better ; for such a reward as the governor&#xD;
l.as otired u il set ten thousand lpairs of&#xD;

I have thought that, n ith your aid, I&#xD;
might possibly take possession of a yacht&#xD;
that is anchored in the harbor," said Gus-&#xD;
tave. "You have men here who would run&#xD;
a little risk where there was a good prospect&#xD;
t gain?"&#xD;
Pablo shook his head.&#xD;
" Senior " said he, gravely, "you are in&#xD;
danger enough now, without incurring more.&#xD;
I sliall not risk my own head and the ruin of&#xD;
my house in any venture like that. If you&#xD;
will pay well, I'll stake my life upon getting&#xD;
you clear of this island ; if rot, you can look&#xD;
to your own esfety ; for I will not betray&#xD;
&#xD;
you. But attempt no further adventaree&#xD;
here, when a price is already set upon your&#xD;
head l"&#xD;
Gustavd saw that lie was helpless; and&#xD;
though the sirit of anger burned like fire&#xD;
away down in his black heart, he answered,&#xD;
with forced composure:&#xD;
"It shall be as you think best, Pablo. I&#xD;
place my fate in your hands, and will abide&#xD;
by your advice. Secure a passage hence for&#xD;
Benito and miiyself, and the money I'named&#xD;
shall be yours before I leave your house."&#xD;
"You shall be safe out of the harbor by&#xD;
to-morrow night. senior. I will engage my&#xD;
men to-night, and make a l ready for to-mo-&#xD;
row night. You will have to go over the&#xD;
city-walls by a rope-ladder--which I have&#xD;
us-d before- and embark a league's distance&#xD;
up the coast ; but I will see you safely off.'&#xD;
" Very well, Pablo; I trust in you. have&#xD;
your preparations made secure ; and if you&#xD;
need gold to bind your men to the work,&#xD;
conic to me."                  -&#xD;
"Yes, seiior," said Pablo, turning to rMtire.&#xD;
" Stay a moment. Pablo," said Benito. "I&#xD;
have over one hundred doubloons hidden in&#xD;
i my house. I like not to go away without&#xD;
then. I can easily go off and leave tiy wile&#xD;
I -for she has a sharp tongue and a viegar&#xD;
temper-but I do not like to lose my gold,&#xD;
nor yet to leave it where it will not benefit&#xD;
anybody-, for it is so well concealed that&#xD;
neither she nor any one else could find it,&#xD;
were they to search a life-time."&#xD;
"'Cell inc where it is concealed, and I will&#xD;

If there is, I have a way of entering my&#xD;
cellar whieh no one but myself knows. It is&#xD;
but a few paces to the old church of Saint&#xD;

I have a passage which I dug out myself,and&#xD;
blocked with flags which I can move. I fixed&#xD;
it so that I mi 'lit hide my money without&#xD;

every dollar of my earnings and put it in&#xD;

has to get along with cottons and ginghams."&#xD;
'Maybe, if you was to black yourself like&#xD;

"half is better than none--I'l do it," said&#xD;
Benito.&#xD;
"Well, von stay here till I go and get in&#xD;

none of my esustomers will get very trouble-&#xD;

CHAPTER XLIV.&#xD;
Gustave Henderson felt anything but easy&#xD;
af er Pablo and Benito had left htim alone.&#xD;
As Pablo had intimated, the " boys " in the&#xD;
outer apartment had begun to wake up. Their&#xD;
harsh calls for liquor, their frequent 'oaths&#xD;
and brut 'l language, f l distinctly upon his&#xD;
ear, andhough he was not himself al-vays&#xD;
perfectly refined in his language, he felt chill-&#xD;
ed and shocked at what he heard, even though&#xD;
the languages used-Spanish, French, and&#xD;
Dutch, as.well as English-were not all well&#xD;
understood by him.&#xD;
He felt uneasy, for he feared that if the po-&#xD;
liee or military should come while Pablo was&#xD;
absent, that they might by some accident dis-&#xD;
cover his hiding-place. And again, lie feared&#xD;
that Benito might, by some mischance, fall&#xD;
into their hands while out, and in spite of&#xD;
all of his protestations of fidelity, betray him.&#xD;
More than once-ay, more than a dozen&#xD;
times-did the Georgian find it necessary to&#xD;
resort to the brandy bottle, to stimulate his&#xD;
failing nerves.&#xD;
And when, suddenly and all unexpeefdly,&#xD;
Pablo by main force lifted up the t p-door&#xD;
from'below, while he'(Henderson) was stand-&#xD;
ing upon it, tossing him over to one side of&#xD;
the room, he trembled all over with nervous-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
For the negro was panting for breathe as if&#xD;
he had been hotly pursued, and huge drops&#xD;
of sweat were pouring down his greasy face,&#xD;
like oozing water along the side of a eoal-&#xD;
none.&#xD;
Ile flung a large bag of gold upon the floor,&#xD;
and shut down the trap without speaking,&#xD;
and then pouring out a glass of raw rum,&#xD;
drank it off in one swallow,&#xD;
What is the matter?  Where is Benito?"&#xD;
asked Gustave, pale with consternation.&#xD;
The devilish fool is dead , but there's the&#xD;
gold he risked and lost his life for 1" said Pab-&#xD;
lo, almost savagely.&#xD;
"Good Pablo, be not angered with me, but&#xD;
explain, will you not?" said Henderson, gen-&#xD;
tly, for the ferocious looks of the negro tern-&#xD;
tied him.&#xD;
Pablo drank another glass of liquor before&#xD;
he would reply. By that time he had re-&#xD;
gained his breath, and seemed more calm.&#xD;
"We went to the house-Benito and me,"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
said he, "and got into the cellar through the&#xD;
old church-vault and passage, as he said we&#xD;
could. And we went very still, and I struck&#xD;
a light, and held it for him while he dug up&#xD;
the money. Just as he handed me the money,&#xD;
I got a glimpse of a soldier, who fired a pis-&#xD;
toi at Benito, who fell, with a death-yell, on&#xD;
the ground, just as I put out the light. The&#xD;
soldier seemed to be as badly scared as I was,&#xD;
for he backed up out of the cellar, and hallo-&#xD;
ed for a light. I stopped to feel of Benito, to&#xD;
see if he was sure dead; for if he had been&#xD;
alive, I would have brought him away. But&#xD;
it was no use-the ball had gone right through&#xD;
his heart. So I kept the money,, and got&#xD;
away as fast as I could, and ran all the way&#xD;
home, except when I was near a guard or&#xD;
sentir.el I"&#xD;
"Were you followed ?" asked Henderson.&#xD;
"No, senor, I think not. I did not wait to&#xD;
see, until I was at the entrance of the hidden&#xD;
passage which leads to the trap-door. I list-&#xD;
ered there, but heard nothing."&#xD;
"Then-you think I am safe yet ?"&#xD;
"Yes, soinor. But I shall get you away as&#xD;
soon as I ean. There's bad luck with you.&#xD;
Isere are two good men gone on your account,&#xD;
and you have failed in what you came for."&#xD;
"True, Pablo. I wish to get away as soon&#xD;
and as quietly as possible."&#xD;
"You shall go, sure, to-morrow night, so-&#xD;
Bor. Now I must get in to my bar, and keep&#xD;
the boas quiet. They're getting rough, to-&#xD;
night.'&#xD;
"Take in a couple of doubloons, and say a&#xD;
friend treats them," said Gustave, offering&#xD;
Pablo the money.&#xD;
"No; I have made enough.for to-night,"&#xD;
said Pablo, pointing to the gold. "Poor Ben-&#xD;
ito ! I would not take more than my half,&#xD;
were he here !"&#xD;
And Pablo took up the bag of gold, and&#xD;
sliding back the panel through which he had&#xD;
passed the tray of provisions, put it through.&#xD;
Then pointing to one of the bunks, he said :&#xD;
"Senor, you had. better try and sleep to-&#xD;
night, if you can. To-morrow night, you&#xD;
will have no chance, and you will need all&#xD;
your nerve and all your strength. You need&#xD;
not fear any danger. I will be on the watch. Ia&#xD;
the morning I will see that you have a'good&#xD;
breakfast ; and by that time I will have seen&#xD;
the men I want to use to-morrow night. Bu-&#xD;
enos noches, senor."   '&#xD;
"Good-night, Pablo," said Henderson. "I&#xD;
will try to sleep, but I fear it will only be a&#xD;
trial."&#xD;
The negro made noreply,butcrept through&#xD;
the panel, which led into a recess close beside&#xD;
his bar, and in a moment he was at his usual&#xD;
post, as Henderson knew by the change of&#xD;
confusion outside. The man evidently had&#xD;
great influence with those whom ho called&#xD;

And Gustave unlocked his trunk and coun-&#xD;
ed out the sum for Paulo. The negro took&#xD;
it, and noticed that quite a large sum m gold&#xD;
still remained i the trunk.&#xD;
"has not the senor got a money-belt?" he&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
No," replied Gustave.&#xD;
"lie must have one," said Pablo. "We&#xD;
cannot carry the trunk over the wall, and it&#xD;
would not Le well to tempt the men, who carry.&#xD;

I feel that it is so, good Pablo, and will&#xD;

You may, secior," replied the negro. "I&#xD;

Your trunk and clothes must be left behind,&#xD;
fur we will have to scale the wall, and then&#xD;
walk over rough, rocky  round, without a&#xD;

"For your safety, you will, senor. And&#xD;
now rest all you can-you will need it."&#xD;
Again Gtistave was alone.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVII.&#xD;
The beautiful yacht had not fairly got out&#xD;
of sight of Moro Castle, when the ' weather-&#xD;
signs," of which Mr. l'erkins had spoken, -e.&#xD;
gan to show themselves so distinctly that the&#xD;
veriest tyro in the study of storms could not&#xD;
mistake them. Adele-who, with Zella, hr.d&#xD;
been on deck ever since the vessel had weigh-&#xD;
ed anchor-looked upon them with curiosity&#xD;
and without fear. For, in her short experi-&#xD;
ence, she had seen how the yacht behaved in&#xD;
a storm-how staunch and trustworthy--and,&#xD;
besides, she had an unfailing confidence in&#xD;
the skill of Harold, his officers and crew.&#xD;
As the "Adele" drew out from the land,&#xD;
the wind, which drew rather off the shore,&#xD;
freshened rapidly ; anId Harold, who was in no&#xD;
haste, told Perkins that lie might as well&#xD;
nake the vessel snug, under short sail, and&#xD;
lay her to, for her natural drift would hike&#xD;
her out of danger, and she would not roll and&#xD;
&#xD;
pitch so much as she would shedding before&#xD;
the ale.&#xD;
This the first officer speedily did,-and when,&#xD;
at twilight, Adele went down with Harold into&#xD;
the cabin for supper, the vessel lay, close&#xD;
hauled by the wind, under a balance-reefed&#xD;
foresail, heaving steadily with the sea, and as&#xD;
graceful as a mermaid at sport, or a swan&#xD;
upon the water.&#xD;
It was far better thus, for there was no&#xD;
straining of hull, rigging, or spars, and the&#xD;
crew had but little to do, but to watch the&#xD;
heave of the sea ; excepting, alone, the&#xD;
hielnisman, who was obliged to watch for the&#xD;
falling off and coming to.&#xD;
Everything seemed pleasant to Adele now.&#xD;
Her voice was as cbeerful, her smile as bright,&#xD;
as it had been before Gustave IIenderson's&#xD;
presence had been discovered in Havana.&#xD;
Uarold, too, was fully himself again-Zella&#xD;
seemed quite glad, and old Nathan had hard&#xD;
work to keep down the exuberance of his&#xD;
spirits.&#xD;
"I swow to gracious, capting !" said he, as&#xD;
he poured out tea, "that I feel ten years&#xD;
younger since we've left that miserable one-&#xD;
boss place ! Call that a city ! with streets no&#xD;
wider than cow-paths. sojers at every corner,&#xD;
and wimmen a sniokin' all the time like so&#xD;
many chimneys ! Ef Ilhad to take my choice&#xD;
between hein' there and crista' in a New&#xD;
Bedford whaler, I think I'd go in for the&#xD;
whaler. Though an easy death by htangin' or&#xD;
drownin' would be a heap better than either&#xD;
of 'em."&#xD;
Harold laughed at the idea, but Adele said&#xD;
that she thought Nathan was quite right.&#xD;
"In truth," said she, "Nafhan is always&#xD;
right."&#xD;
"'Ceptin' when he is wrong, Miss Adele,"&#xD;
said the old man.&#xD;
"When were you ever wrong ?" asked&#xD;
Adele, with a smile.                -&#xD;
"Oh, a great many times, Miss Adele !-&#xD;
'specially when I wasyoung. I used to stick&#xD;
crooked pins under the seat of the deacon's&#xD;
trowsers, when he stood up to sing in meeting',&#xD;
for his pdw was just afront of our'n. And I&#xD;
used to put red pepper on the stove at sing..&#xD;
in'-school, and sneeze everybody out o'doors&#xD;
and cough 'em into fits. I used to be a wild&#xD;
lad ; but them days are past."&#xD;
And Nathan heaved a heavy sigh.&#xD;
After supper, Harold went on deck for a&#xD;
time, accompanied by Adele ; but as the&#xD;
storm grew heavier as the hours of the night&#xD;
advanced, they soon'returned to the cabin,&#xD;
where Adele, with her music, made all hearts&#xD;
joyous until the usual hour of retiring.&#xD;
Another day was just dawning. The storm&#xD;
had grown stronger and stronger during the&#xD;
night, and now it blew a perfect hurricane.&#xD;
&#xD;
But the gallant schooner, laying up else in decks. Put one of the crew over him as a&#xD;

Mr. Perkins was the officer of the deck, and " Ay, ay, sir !"&#xD;
was standing near the helmsman, quietly     "Have the vessel laid to the wind again,&#xD;
sinng him a yarn about a nu ricale he had sir."&#xD;
once weathered on an East Indian voyage ;    "She is upin the wind's eye again, and tiw&#xD;

had been but an egg-shell.                   "No. A small vessel an against us, and&#xD;
One wild cry, and as the schooner under was shattered," he replied. "Our vessel is&#xD;

And Adele, with tears streaming from her&#xD;
eyes, went below.&#xD;
Harold walked forward to the spot where&#xD;
Henderson stood, looking sullenly at his now&#xD;
manacled hands.&#xD;
'You need not put irons upon his feet,&#xD;
Mr. Perkins,'' said Harold. Then, addressing&#xD;
Hienderson, he said:&#xD;
"Sir, one whom you have persecuted most&#xD;
cruelly and unjun tlv, has pleaded with me to be&#xD;
merciful to ti u. I have not yet decided what&#xD;
course to pursune. Your own conduct will&#xD;
influence my de csion. If I carry you back&#xD;
to Cuba, the laws which you have transgressed&#xD;
will demanyl von as the third victim of -our&#xD;
own con-piraev to assassinate me! If I do&#xD;
not take yon back there, but at some con-&#xD;
venient lace 1:in1 you, what assurance will I&#xD;
have that you will not again try to take my&#xD;
life, or to persecute her who but now pleaded&#xD;
with me to spare you ?"&#xD;
"My honor! tUpon my honor, I will go&#xD;
home to my plantation, and never leave it,&#xD;
or breathe your name or hers, or think of, or&#xD;
do, a deed of hiari to either of you!"&#xD;
Your honor ?" and Harold looked coldly&#xD;
upon him. " Mu of honor have enmities,&#xD;
but they do not hire assassins to terminate&#xD;
them!"&#xD;
My oath ! May I be accursed of Heaven&#xD;
and among men, if I do not keep my oath I"&#xD;
sail Hlenderson, imploringly.&#xD;
" I will take your oath; but mark me, Gus-&#xD;
tave henderson, if you break it. I never will&#xD;
spare you again! And until I can put you&#xD;
on shore, yom m1)rust be content to remain un-&#xD;
der guard here. Now answer me a few ques-&#xD;
tions."&#xD;
"Ask them, and I will reply truly !" said&#xD;
Henderson, meekly.        -&#xD;
"how long had you ben in Cuba when&#xD;
you attempted to have me assassinated ?"&#xD;
"Only two days.   I went to New York,&#xD;
found out what port you had cleared for, and&#xD;
*     followed you."&#xD;
"how did you escape from the Island ?"&#xD;
"In a fishing-boat, manned by two men,&#xD;
who were to take me to Key West. They&#xD;
went down with their boat, I suppose."&#xD;
"From Key West, you intended to follow&#xD;
me to my next port?'&#xD;
"I did."&#xD;
"Did you learn whither I was bound ?"&#xD;
"Yes-to New Orleans. It was so an-&#xD;
nounced in the lavana Evening Gazeta."&#xD;
"And you now will swear, upon the Holy&#xD;
Evangelists, that if I spare you, you will&#xD;
&#xD;
cease to follow me and Miss Dumesle-will&#xD;
never attempt to do us harm, and will return,&#xD;
after I have landed you; to your plantation,&#xD;
and will remain there ?"&#xD;
"I will, so help me Heaven !"&#xD;
"Very well, sir. I will have such an oath&#xD;
written out and subscribed by you. Mr. Per-&#xD;
kins will relieve you of your' handcuffs, but&#xD;
you will be placed in a state-room, which&#xD;
you must not leave until I am ready to set&#xD;
you on shore. A sentinel will be kept before&#xD;
your door, and his orders will be to shoot&#xD;
you down if you attempt to lass hiiu&#xD;
"I will remain where you place me, air,&#xD;
and not transgress your orders."&#xD;
"Very well. Mr Perkins, you will place&#xD;
this man in Mr. Merton's state-room, and put&#xD;
a trusty man on guard, to be relieved every&#xD;
two hours? The officer of the watch will per-&#xD;
sonally see to the safety of the prisoner once&#xD;
in every hour. Mr. Merton can room in the&#xD;
after-cabin, until we make land.  See that&#xD;
refreshments are provided for Mr. Ilenderson.&#xD;
And the moment the storm lulls so that we&#xD;
can carry sail, inform me; for I shall steer for&#xD;
the nearest of the Florida Keys as soon as&#xD;
possible."&#xD;
Having thus given his orders, Iarold went&#xD;
below, for he knew they would be implicitly'&#xD;
obeyed.&#xD;
"Adele," said he, when lie entered the cab-&#xD;
in, "at your request, I have spared him, and&#xD;
taken his oath that he will not follow or per-&#xD;
secute either of us more I"      ' -&#xD;
"The pizen sarpint won't keep it, eapting,"&#xD;
said Nathan, who had been a witness to the&#xD;
interview on deck, and who had followed&#xD;
Harold into the cabin. "I know he won't;&#xD;
he said so with his tongue, but the devil in&#xD;
his eye lied all the time."&#xD;
"Well, my word is passed. Spare him I&#xD;
will, this time--but never again, if he breaks&#xD;
his oath and crosses my path !"&#xD;
"We will hope that he will keep his oath,"&#xD;
said Adele. "And now tell meAHarold," she&#xD;
added, "could you, when by such a fearful&#xD;
chance he was thrown helpless into your pow.&#xD;
er, have delivered him up to certain death,&#xD;
without compunction ?"&#xD;
"No, Adele ; on calm reflection, I could&#xD;
not have done so, and I thank you as much&#xD;
for your interference, as I honor you for the&#xD;
noble ebarity which you have displayed to-&#xD;
ward a fallen foe. You ar., in all things, my&#xD;
better angel!l"&#xD;
" You flatter me, dear Harold. I try to be&#xD;
right and to do right. I knew your good,&#xD;
brave heart would second my thoughts, as&#xD;
soon as you took time to consult it.'&#xD;
Mr. Perkins came down at this moment,&#xD;
and said:&#xD;
"I think, sir, if you especially wish it, that&#xD;
we could edge away for the Tortugas, under&#xD;

Turning to the helmsman, he said:  ,    quite humbly : for he had been treated far&#xD;
" Keep.her off a couple of points. Slacken better than he expected. "1 am thankful&#xD;

Harold came back, and as he heard his step,&#xD;
Gustave subsided into the same apparent&#xD;
\tuutble mood which he had exhibited before.&#xD;
"Miss Duunesle does not desire to see you,"&#xD;
said Iarold. "But 8e 0bade me tell you to&#xD;
go and be a better man. As soon as she ar-&#xD;
rives at her majority-in less than two years&#xD;
--she will return to Georgia to claim her&#xD;
property ; and if then she finds that your ref-&#xD;
ormation is complete, she will greet you as&#xD;
a friend. And now, as the boat is waiting,&#xD;
you had better he off. I myself wish you&#xD;
success in all lawful and honorable pursuits."&#xD;
Henderson made no reply, but followed&#xD;
Harold on (leek, and in a very few minutes&#xD;
stood upon the deck of the " Whale," which&#xD;
had just begun to gather headway.&#xD;
Having shipped his passenger, Harold now&#xD;
bade his helmsman to put the helm weather,&#xD;
and bore away on his course to the westward&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"rake your bearing and distance, Mr. Per-&#xD;
kins, and lay our course for the Balize," said&#xD;
hIarold, cheerfully, after speaking to the&#xD;
belmsiman.-&#xD;
Seeing Nathan standing by the cabin hatch-&#xD;
way, looking gravely toward the schooner, he&#xD;
naked the old man what he w'as thinking of.&#xD;
I'm awful glad, captin , that Jonah has&#xD;
left us and gone into the Whale !" said Nath-&#xD;
an. "And of the Whale never p ued him&#xD;
ashore ag'in, the world would be better off.&#xD;
That's what I was thinkin' of, capting !"&#xD;
Harold laughed at Nathan's not incongrous&#xD;
idea, and rwent below.&#xD;
CHAPTER L.&#xD;
"How far is it to Key West ?" was the first&#xD;
question which Gustave Henderson asked,&#xD;
when he got on board the schooner," Whale."&#xD;
"A matter of seventy-five or eighty miles,"&#xD;
said the shriveled -up skipper.&#xD;
"When will we get there ?" asked Gus-&#xD;
tave.&#xD;
"If it hl   thard enough, in a couple of&#xD;
days." said the skipper.&#xD;
"'Two days? Why, a crab could crawl&#xD;
there in that time !"&#xD;
"Yes; a crab would have the advantage of&#xD;
us in goin' to windward. B~ut we're in no&#xD;
a    hurry; and the old schooner is confrtable, if&#xD;
she is ugly, and isn't fast. Yoq can't capsize&#xD;
her; and when she once gets agoin', she keeps&#xD;
agoin' till you dro her mud-hook, and bring&#xD;
her up I We've plenty to eat and drink, and&#xD;
that's about all that a man wants in this&#xD;
world. D'ye chaw tobakket mister?" And&#xD;
Captain Thompson pulled out a huge plug,&#xD;
and extended it toward Gustave.&#xD;
"No, thank you." said Gustave.&#xD;
"Maybe you drink rum? I've god some&#xD;
capital old Jamaica down below. Took it&#xD;

&#xD;
ago. Had four puncheons-used 'em all up&#xD;
btit one. Come here some of you and steer-&#xD;
I'm going below to treat the passenger."&#xD;
Having been relieved from the tiller, skip-&#xD;
per Thompson led the way down into what&#xD;
he called the cabin. It was a dark, greasy-&#xD;
looking hole, about twelve or fourteen fest&#xD;
long, by six or seven wide, ,just high enough&#xD;
for a man to stand up in, with two bunks on&#xD;
each side, filled with blankets and quilts,&#xD;
which looked as if they had never been in-&#xD;
jured by contact with soap andewater.&#xD;
In the after-end of this den was a greasy&#xD;
table, set firm against the stern timbersrand&#xD;
over it a lot of shelves, with ledges in front&#xD;
to keep the dishes from sliding off.&#xD;
The captain took a couple of tin cups from&#xD;
one of these shelves, and a broken bowl half-&#xD;
full of Muscavado sugar ; also, a couple of&#xD;
pewter tea-spoons. Then be inserted his arm&#xD;
into a side-locker, just abaft the sternmost&#xD;
bunk, and drew out a jug.&#xD;
"Take hold, mister," said he, to Hender-&#xD;
son. "This ere Jamaica is jest as mellow as&#xD;
honey, and don't need no water, though I&#xD;
like sweet'nin' in it."&#xD;
Henderson poured out a eup of "Jamaica,"&#xD;
added a little sugar, and rank it off, surpris-&#xD;
ed to find it really good-far better than li-&#xD;
quor of that kind which he had paid a high&#xD;
price for.&#xD;
When he spoke of this, Skipper Thompson&#xD;
said :&#xD;
"It's good, for tyo reasons. First, I've&#xD;
had it a good while, and most likely 'twas&#xD;
pretty well on in years when I got hold of it.&#xD;
Then, it always improves liquor when it is&#xD;
carried aboard ship. The jouncing up and&#xD;
down, and stirring about, makes it richer and&#xD;
mellower, I think. Churns it, you see."&#xD;
"Probably," said Henderson ; and he tried&#xD;
a second "nip."  "B  the way, captain, what&#xD;
is my passage ?"he a  ed.&#xD;
"Well, seem' that t-ou like rum, as I do,&#xD;
and aren't like to be stingy, I'll leave it all to&#xD;
yourself," said Thompson.&#xD;
"Will that do ?"&#xD;
And as he spoke, Gustave took a doubloon&#xD;
from his pocket, and laid it down on the ta-&#xD;
ble.&#xD;
"Yes; with a thankee on my side to boot,&#xD;
and jest as much rum as youcan drink, and&#xD;
all you can eat till we get in, if it's a month&#xD;
from new I" said the skipper, pocketing the&#xD;
col'.&#xD;
"If I had not met with bad luck in the gale&#xD;
last night, I should have been in Key West&#xD;
sooner !" said Gustave.&#xD;
"Bad luck? fHow was that?" asked the&#xD;
skipper, as he refilled his cup.&#xD;

sel, bound for Key West. The schooner&#xD;
