CHAPTER I.&#xD;
J~ the village of Asliton, which, in order to avoid&#xD;
rious surmises as to personalities, as well as ~critical&#xD;
investigation as to accurate topography, it need only&#xD;
said, was within the bounds Qf Massachusetts, there liv&#xD;
at the period to which the commencement of the I&#xD;
lowing tale refers-fl8O-~--a person of the name of Gi&#xD;
ton. He had but recently be~ime a resident of I&#xD;
place~-a fact in itself or not much importance, but wh~&#xD;
had excited no small speculation among his neighbor&#xD;
The residence Mr. Grafton had chosen was, inde4&#xD;
little suited to his previous habits and associations.&#xD;
travekd man, a scholar, and a gentleman without a La&#xD;
ily, it might well be supposed, could find few indu&#xD;
ments to adventure into a rude settlement, in the vie:&#xD;
ity of which the savage yet lingered. Still there was&#xD;
mystery in the case. It was simply an instance of id&#xD;
syncrasy. He had, though yet in the prime of life, se&#xD;
the world, had participated in its pleasures, had not&#xD;
caped its trials, and had not withheld himself from.&#xD;
duties. But a nervous dislike of the restraints and&#xD;
mands of society, co-operating with a reserved temr&#xD;
and health not robust, had led him to seek in retiree&#xD;
the enjoyment of his favorite pursuits, which he eou&#xD;
not disguise to himself Was as selfish as impracticable&#xD;
the busier haunts of men. Accident had led him to ti&#xD;
particular spot, where his townsmen, leaving him ~&#xD;

&#xD;
enjoyment of his books and his time, were quite willing&#xD;
to cq~mmute his personal services for the pecuniary aid&#xD;
he was at all times ready to contribute, Although not&#xD;
more than thirty, he appeared older; for a countenance&#xD;
marked by reflecti6h, and. an air of languor, gave the ef-&#xD;
fect of more years than he had seen. His manner be-&#xD;
trayed no consciousness of superiority, a~id his dress,&#xD;
though scrupulously neat, was equally unostentatious,&#xD;
yet both ~sufficiently indicated that he belonged to a&#xD;
more cultivated order than the persons among whom he&#xD;
had taken up his abode. His house, to which a small&#xD;
garden was attached, in size and style befitted the small&#xD;
establishment within, consisting of himself, a lad for out-&#xD;
of-door services, and one female domestic, who united in&#xD;
herself the offices of chamber-maid, cook, and house-&#xD;
keeper. But, far from conceiving this to be derogatory,&#xD;
not the Diva tr~formis could have entertained more com-&#xD;
placent notions of her importance in her three-fold ca-&#xD;
pacity than did Damie Turner of hers, as she passed&#xD;
through her several transformations, and finally attain-&#xD;
ed, at abou~ five o'clock in the afternoon, her most dis-&#xD;
tinguished position. Then, with clean gown, cap, and&#xD;
apron, she was prepared to attend on Mr. Grafton's tea-&#xD;
table, to "turn out" in country phrase, the refreshing&#xD;
beverage, and to see that things were as they should be.&#xD;
Damie, who rejoiced in the baptismal name of Dci-&#xD;
darnia, was a woman of a " certain age," whose single&#xD;
blessedness it might have been unjtistly suspected no&#xD;
man had' wished to disturb. Beauty had never been&#xD;
among her gifts, -which was perhaps the reason of her&#xD;
very just estimate of it-she often averring that "to be&#xD;
pretty behaved waS much better than to be pretty look-&#xD;
ing." She had many good qualities, was kind-hearted&#xD;
and upright, and, though self-sufficient, was not insuffi-&#xD;
cient~ Mr. Grafton, on his part, was easily satisfied, and,&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.&#xD;
so long as his books and papers Were untouched, Was&#xD;
not unreasonably curious about her housekeeping&#xD;
From this indulgence, Damie's power grew in time to&#xD;
overshadow the little household, Mr. Grafton submitting&#xD;
to an evil of his Own creating, by good.naturedly apply.&#xD;
ing the Shandy maxim, "We lose the right of complain.&#xD;
ing by forbearing to use it."&#xD;
A fine day in May had closed, and, seated in his&#xD;
study chair by the side of a fire, even at that season not&#xD;
unwelcome, Mr. Grafton was 'poring over a favorite au-&#xD;
thor, with no sound to break the silence but the purring&#xD;
of a privileged cat. The evening Wore away to a late&#xD;
hour. The lights in the adjacent dwellings, one after&#xD;
another, had been extinguished, He shut his book, and,&#xD;
with his eyes turned to the window, and arrested by a&#xD;
candle that stilt burned in a distant part of the village,&#xD;
lie applied the line, which has so often occurred to oth-&#xD;
ers,&#xD;
"So shines a good deed in a naughty world,"&#xD;
When he Was roused by the Sound of horses' feet. They&#xD;
approached, and appeared to stop at his gate. It open-&#xD;
ed, and in a moment a knock announced a visitor.~at&#xD;
such an hour an unusual occurrence. As Damie open-&#xD;
ed the door, a person entered so hastily as to brush out&#xD;
the light in her hand-....ske always insisted designedly~&#xD;
and she could only discern a tall figure much muffled,&#xD;
who, without heeding her, proceeded quickly toward the&#xD;
room in which Mr. Grafton was seated, and presented&#xD;
himself with the air of a gentleman, but with a counte-&#xD;
nance expressive of anxiety and urgency.&#xD;
With a courteous request to be seated he complied,&#xD;
but without laying aside his cloak, though apparently&#xD;
encumbered by it, and though the fire seemed to invite&#xD;
him so to do. His body, strangely disproportioned to&#xD;
his face, which was thin and rather pale, arrested the&#xD;

WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
usually incurious gaze of Mr. Grafton, and an awkward&#xD;
silei~e ensued, while IDamie purposely loitered in the&#xD;
room, and the stranger directed his piercing eyes by&#xD;
turns on both. At length, as if he had no time for cer-&#xD;
emony, he abruptly requested a private interview with&#xD;
the former.&#xD;
As soon as they were alone, throwing aside his cloak,&#xD;
he revealed to the astonished Mr. Grafton a child of&#xD;
about three years of age asleep on his breast, an attempt&#xD;
to conceal whom had so much added to his apparent&#xD;
bulk.&#xD;
"The little fellow is so wearied with his drive," said&#xD;
he, gently disengaging him," that I doubt if h~ wake to-&#xD;
night; but I must liberate myseig at all events, for I&#xD;
have brief time for even a few words ;" saying which,&#xD;
and farming a pallet of his cloak on the floor by his&#xD;
side,' he laid the child on it without disturbing his slum'&#xD;
ber; then, addressing Mr. Grafton in a tone of confidence&#xD;
and respect, he continued:&#xD;
"Your name and character, sir, are known to me, and&#xD;
I can give no better proof of the high estimation with&#xD;
which you have inspired me than by the trust I am about&#xD;
to repose in you. Without circumlocution-~--'for, with&#xD;
you, truth the most' direct must be the most acceptable-&#xD;
the object for which I have 'ventured to obtrude myself&#xD;
upon you is to request that you. will become the protector&#xD;
of this child, without question of his birth or destiny; that&#xD;
from this moment you will receive him under your roof,&#xD;
there to remain till claimed by his natural guardians."&#xD;
Occupied in a survey of the person who proffered so&#xD;
unexpected and so unwished-for an expression of his&#xD;
spect, Mr. GrafLon did not immediately reply, nor was&#xD;
the result of'the survey favorable to the request.&#xD;
There was in the strongerr, with the carriage of a gEm.&#xD;
tleman, an easy assurance that by no means inspired&#xD;

the confidence it expressed, while his eye, quick, intelli-&#xD;
gent, and penetrating, sought rather to      to&#xD;
)   be observed. He might be rather younger than Mr.&#xD;
Grafton, and was decidedly handsome; yet there Were&#xD;
hard lines, traced either by bad passions or an irregular&#xD;
life, that gave a sinister expression to his face.&#xD;
"I wait your assent, sir," he continued, with a slight&#xD;
frown of impatience, but in the blandest tone.&#xD;
"You can hardly be serious," replied Mr. Grafton, "in&#xD;
expecting an assent to a proposition so unqualified, and&#xD;
unattended by a single circumstance that can even justi-&#xD;
fy my assuming such a responsibility.'~&#xD;
"The more unqualified the trust, the greater the con-&#xD;
fidence reposed."&#xD;
Before the shuffle could be detected or replied to, he&#xD;
continued: "And allow me to add that Mr. Grafton is&#xD;
the last man living who would require to beju8t~yied in&#xD;
the performance of a benevolent action." -&#xD;
"Excuse me, sir; but we will, if you please, dispense&#xD;
with compliments. This is at least as much a matter of&#xD;
business as of sentiment; and, to be very plain with you,&#xD;
there must be strong claims to induce me to take it into&#xD;
consideration' even for an instant, If there are such,&#xD;
which is in the highest degree improbable, I am Willing&#xD;
to hear them."&#xD;
The stranger, it would seem, had trusted to the effect&#xD;
of his full and broad demand on what he had been led&#xD;
1~o consider the easy temper of Mr. Grafton to prodnc&amp;amp;a&#xD;
sort of amazed compliance; but, unabashed by its fail.&#xD;
ure, with persuasive accents he proceeded:&#xD;
"I can plead no claim but that of the friendless. This&#xD;
poor child iscast upon you by the same Providence that&#xD;
has more than 'supplied your own wants, and now calls&#xD;
on you for that portion of your care for which there is.&#xD;
no natural claimant." -&#xD;

8            WALTER THORNLEY     OR,&#xD;
Though uttered in the most respectfL~tl maimer, this&#xD;
laying down the law of moral obligation by a stranger,&#xD;
reqitiring as a duty a favor of such magnitude, was so&#xD;
offensive that Mr. GraftoA was on the point of express-&#xD;
lug a decided refusal, when the child-who till now had&#xD;
lain quietly.----gave signs of awaking, turned over, stretch-&#xD;
ed his limbs, and opened his eyes, which h~tppening to&#xD;
rest on his near neighbor, 'the fat, beautiful tortoise-shell&#xD;
colored cat he st rted up, and uttering a cry of surprise&#xD;
and pleasure, ex~iaimed,. "Oh prettyy! , pretty 1"&#xD;
What eloquence so perstiasive as the ~weet voice of&#xD;
infancy! The repellent emotions which were kindling&#xD;
in the breast of Mr. Grafton werc~ stilled. Repressing&#xD;
the reply he was about to make, his eye rested on the&#xD;
* little being before him, as, refreshed ,and animated, he&#xD;
seran bled up from the pallet that had been spread for&#xD;
hiin~ and sought to win the sleek and beautiful animal&#xD;
by his carsses. -&#xD;
The appearance of the child was well fitted to fix the&#xD;
attention of a person even less kindly, disposed than Mr.&#xD;
Grafton toward such sometimes wayward sprites. His&#xD;
sturdy 1itt~e figure, his finely-formed and well-set head,&#xD;
covered with lu~Thiant curls, which yetpermitted the ex-&#xD;
posure of his fair forehead,; his bright eye, his ruby lip,&#xD;
scarce passed from the rose-bud of infancy to the better-&#xD;
defined lines which develop it a little later; the dim-&#xD;
pled-cheek, the joyous laugh, the graceful attitudes into&#xD;
which he unconsciously threw himself in his gambols&#xD;
with puss, the warm light shed by the fire, presented a&#xD;
study for a painter as well as an appeal to a philanthro-&#xD;
p~st, and Mr. Grafton felt his refusal melt away in a gush&#xD;
-of kindness and pity. lie began to take a new view of&#xD;
the matter, to seek in his heart excuses for what ap-&#xD;
peared to his judgment a piece of Quixotism. "Sup-&#xD;
pose I am a bachelor, unskilled in the care and training&#xD;

of a child, I am the more unembarrassed by any con-&#xD;
flicting duties; and my beloved quiet-I shall but enjoy&#xD;
it the more if it be sometimes interrup1~d."&#xD;
The distrust, too, which he felt for the stranger in-&#xD;
creased his compassion for the child. "Shall I leave&#xD;
hini," he thought, "perhaps to an evil destiny, when it&#xD;
is asked of me to rescue him ?" But Damie-there was&#xD;
the rub; "she would probably object to her share of&#xD;
the additional burden, and he should deprive himself of&#xD;
her services, or be involved in domestic jars. What&#xD;
then? Should he for such a consideration reject the&#xD;
little creature thus cast on his mercy? Xo; Damie, im-&#xD;
portant as she was,~ might go, the child should stay."&#xD;
The stranger eyed him attentively, and read in the&#xD;
softened expression of his face the operation of new&#xD;
feelings.&#xD;
"You consent, then, I perceive, sir," said he. "You&#xD;
justify my hopes, and secure to yourself the reward of&#xD;
the beneficent. That," rising, and presenting a letter&#xD;
contains all that it is necessary to communicate. Fare-&#xD;
well. I must be many miles from here 'before the dawn,"&#xD;
and hastily wrapping himself in his cloak, as if about to&#xD;
leave the room, he paused a moment, and fixed a part-&#xD;
ing glance on the child.&#xD;
"I must leave him without his knowledge," continued&#xD;
he in an under tone, rather as if addressing himself; "he&#xD;
would resist my doing so ~ere he aware of it, though,&#xD;
when I am gone, he will be easily pacified." Then, with&#xD;
an inclination of the head, a finger on his lip to request&#xD;
silence, and a quick inaudible step, he vanished as if in-&#xD;
corporeal, leaving Mr. Grafton- time neither for far her&#xD;
question nor reflection. lie held for some moments me-&#xD;
c~Ianically the letter committed to him, scarcely sure if&#xD;
he were not in a dream, so strange and sudden had been&#xD;
the revQlution wrought in his quiet abode. Curiosity,&#xD;

however, soon ~rompt~d to a perusal of it. It contained&#xD;
a small sum of money and the following lines:&#xD;
'"His name is Walter Thoruley; his age three years.&#xD;
A valise, containing such clothing ~ts is at present neces-&#xD;
sary for. him,, will be found at your door. Funds shall&#xD;
from time, to time be remitted for his support. Lie is&#xD;
not to be sentto a public school; but his education must&#xD;
neVertheless be that which befits a gentleman. You will&#xD;
not communicate the circumstances under which he has&#xD;
been confided to you, yet an appearance of mystery is&#xD;
o be avoided~ Curiosity is not to be excited."&#xD;
The. easy impudence of these requirements by the&#xD;
obliged party provoked a smile.&#xD;
"A pretty, felloW, truly 1" exclaimed Mr. Grafton;&#xD;
"imposes on me the trouble of rearing and instructing&#xD;
his child,~and dictates the manner with the air of a sov.&#xD;
ereign prescribing the education of his heir apparent U,&#xD;
In the mean time Damie, wb.6 had heard the stranger&#xD;
withdraw~ and who was by iio means superior to the in.&#xD;
*     firmly common to all persons excluded' from confer-&#xD;
ences, entered, with some ready ~xcuse f6r her reap-&#xD;
pearance, when the sight ~of the 'child struck b~r dumb.&#xD;
Looking from him to. Mr. Grafton, from Mr. Grafton to&#xD;
the child, she stood silent and 'motionless. At leiigth,&#xD;
recovering her speech, she exclaimed, as she seated her~&#xD;
self in th~ nearest chair, "Well, ifi ain't '1~eat 1"&#xD;
Mr. Grafton was sufficiently disposed to obey the last&#xD;
injunction of the letter. 'He had no mind to be a village&#xD;
wonder, to prevent which, he quietly remarked that&#xD;
"the child hadbeen placed under his guardianship, and&#xD;
that he and 8he must make the best of it."&#xD;
This did not satisfy flamie, who, bursting with ques-&#xD;
tions as to "'who?" "what?" and "where?" condensed&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT TIlE PAST.          II&#xD;
&#xD;
all into one, which she trusted would lead to a solution&#xD;
of every other.&#xD;
"What is his name ?" she inquired.&#xD;
Mr. Grafton informed her adding, with affected indi2t~.&#xD;
ference, uncertain as yet how this addition to her cares&#xD;
would be regarded, "You see, Damie, that you and I&#xD;
can not shut ourselves out from the troubles of tht world&#xD;
any. more than others. If we do not seek them, they&#xD;
come to us."&#xD;
The child, meanwhile, all unconscious that his destiny&#xD;

one covert to another till she had ensconced herself un-&#xD;
ckr the chair occupied by Damie, who, not yet decided&#xD;
in what light to regard the little intruder was following&#xD;
him about with her eyes in mute perp xity.&#xD;
At this juncture the cat, who, am g her immunities,&#xD;
chiefly valued her quiet nap befor the study fire, who&#xD;
had not been so hunted about sin she wa~ a kitten,&#xD;
and, though she "wore motley," had no fancy, to play&#xD;
the fool, grew tired of having her well-dressed whiskers&#xD;
twitched, her tail pulled, and her smooth coat of many&#xD;
colors brushed the wrong way. When, therefore, she&#xD;
had gained her last retreat, and her indefatigable pur-&#xD;
suer, with a cry of exultation, seized her, she turned on&#xD;
the defensive, and inflicted such vengeance with her&#xD;
talons, that he was obliged, though not without a brave&#xD;
struggle for. victory, to release her, uttering at the same&#xD;
time a scream of pain, and holding up his bleeding chub-&#xD;
by hand with an imploring look to Damie.&#xD;
Mr. Grafton was at rest; the crisis was favorable;&#xD;
Damie caught him in her arms, beat puss, and kissed&#xD;
his hand; and the little fellow, moaning with pain, re-&#xD;
clined on her bosom till he completely subdued her.&#xD;
"He has cried himself to sleep," said Mr. Grafton;&#xD;
"where will you lay him for the night, Damie ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
* ~' Where?" repeated she; "why in my own bed, be&#xD;
sure. The poor little cre'ter sha'n't never sleep nowhere&#xD;
else~'" And there, accordingly, he was s~t~~...bestowecl&#xD;
with no sense of stiffering or desertion.&#xD;
In~ the morning, however, strange voices and objects&#xD;
disturbed him. The images which frolic and pain had&#xD;
chased away returned. He looked in vain for some fa&#xD;
miiar face, till, disappointed and confounded, he threw&#xD;
himself back on his pillow, covered his eyes, and cried&#xD;
aloud for so/me one, but with such imperfect articulation&#xD;
that the united efforts of Mr. Grafton and Damie could&#xD;
make nothing intelligible of the sounds.&#xD;
"Poor boy !" said Mr. Grafton, sadly, "he calls for&#xD;
those who, can not hear, and who would not if they&#xD;
could. Fortunately, his tender mind will soon yield to&#xD;
other impressions."&#xD;
In.. effecting this change, the fearless temper of the&#xD;
child much~ aided. lie was soon won by kindness, and&#xD;
reposed himself withotit distrust on his new friends,&#xD;
though his heaving bosom and occasional sobs indicated,&#xD;
that his little heart was troubled. For days his anxious&#xD;
glance was directed to .every opening door, and an ap.&#xD;
preaching footstep vjPould arrest his attention in the midst&#xD;
of his play. In her endeavors to soothe him, Damie&#xD;
found 14s first acquaintance, puss, an able coadjutor.&#xD;
Having instructed him so to caress as not to irritate her,&#xD;
she skillfully combined something of responsibility and&#xD;
occupation with amusement by making it his business&#xD;
to feed her, an office that so delighted him that his own&#xD;
meal was often left untasted till he should~ place her&#xD;
saucer c~f milk andher morsel of meat. An24d her kind&#xD;
attentions to the little stranger, Damie's curiosity re.&#xD;
* gained as unsatisfied and as eager as ever; and, finding~&#xD;
Mr. Grafton insensible to all ~her hints, her woman's in-&#xD;
genuity was ~et to work to extract information from. the&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
Ix&#xD;
&#xD;
child himself. Here she was alike unsuccessful. In&#xD;
/&#xD;
vain ~he tried and pumped; asked about father mother,&#xD;
brothers, sisters, home; and she at length relinquished&#xD;
the attempt to interpret words which, a~ the past was in&#xD;
part effaced by new impressions, seemed fewer and more&#xD;
unintelli~ible at every trial. The valise, which had&#xD;
been the first object of her investigation, was found to&#xD;
contain a supply of clothing, but no marks. It was evi-&#xD;
dent that pains had been taken to efface them from a&#xD;
few articles more worn, and of finer materials, and which&#xD;
yere ornamented as mothers love to deck their darlings.&#xD;
Bat the greater number were plain, and appeared not to&#xD;
have had any. The former Damie abstracted for rea-&#xD;
sons of her own.&#xD;
"They ain't no use now; he's most grown out of 'em;&#xD;
and who knows but they may be wanted some day to&#xD;
sartify to the child ?"&#xD;
The benevolence of Mr. Grafton soon gathered its re~&#xD;
ward. The little being thus strangely imposed on him,&#xD;
as if conscious of peculiar obligations, seemed to strive&#xD;
to make the only return in his power-his caresses and&#xD;
obedience.&#xD;
Without disturbing the quiet, he infused cheerfulness&#xD;
into the hitherto joyless dwelling. By a sort of instinct&#xD;
he seemed to know when he must suppress and when he&#xD;
might indulge his merriment, and&#xD;
"Provoke&#xD;
A partnership in play."&#xD;
It Mr. Grafton were reading, Walter remained immov-&#xD;
able on his little cricket, and addressed his inseparable&#xD;
companion, puss, in whispers. But when the book was&#xD;
laid aside, and his "uncle," as he was instructed to call&#xD;
his guardian, at leisure, he knew he was permitted to&#xD;
approach, to mount his knee unchidden, and to ask for&#xD;
the oft-repeated, never-wearying story which Mr. Graf~&#xD;

toii-4iimself a child in simplicity and tenderness-soon&#xD;
1ear~ed to adapt to his auditor. Day after day was told&#xD;
the tale&#xD;
"Of orphan babes,&#xD;
* With berries smeared, with hrambies torn,"&#xD;
of dutiful hut unfQrtunate Red Riding-hood; of the mar~&#xD;
velous bean-pole, the top of which, like the fabled sum~&#xD;
mit of ])emavend; was nearer heaven than earth; of the&#xD;
magic slipper, and the beneficent fairy, and all the fan~&#xD;
tactic tales of the olden time, which, after amusing the&#xD;
nurseries of our graiddames, furnish the ~1rama of their&#xD;
adult descendants. But, above all, Walter delighted in&#xD;
the wonderful achieVements of "Puss iii Boots," and&#xD;
nearly renewed the ancient battle between himself and&#xD;
his four-footed friend by an attempt to force her into the&#xD;
same un5~mly gnise. Then, changing his theme, Mr.&#xD;
Grafton would descend from these legends to the expe-&#xD;
nenee of common mortals, and inculcate a moral from&#xD;
the fi~te of those who had neither fairies to befriend nor&#xD;
ogres to distress them; of good k~ys, like himself; an~ii&#xD;
of bad ones whom "nobody loved"-a predicament, of&#xD;
all others, terrible to Walter. At other times, in the&#xD;
scene of Damie's labors, with the irrepressible activity&#xD;
of children, he proffered his "hindering help," by which,&#xD;
if her work was not advanced, he was amused, and she&#xD;
was not displeased. Sometimes, his powers and faculties&#xD;
suspended on the reVolutions of her wheel, he wou]~d sit&#xD;
silent and motionless, his eye following, as with slow,&#xD;
retreating step she mysteriously extended the roll into&#xD;
the long and slender thread; then would come the rous~&#xD;
ing turn which was to render it fine, and ~smooth, and&#xD;
strong; and then, after a momentary inverted motion&#xD;
of her wheel, it was carried to the point of the spindle,&#xD;
which seemed to Walter to swallow tip the yarn as fast&#xD;
as Damie could spin it. To the hum of her wheel she&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
added a song as monotonous; yet, as if his ear were at-&#xD;
tuned to sound, and could catch its slightest variations,&#xD;
he listened with satisfaction,' and was impatient of inter-&#xD;
ruption.&#xD;
To his amusement succeeded his instruction, and Da-&#xD;
mie was advanced from his nurse to his dame. The Ia.&#xD;
hors of the day over, she assumed, with her afternoon's&#xD;
better apparel, the office of schoolmistress, tau4it him to&#xD;
repeat the strange characters of his horn.book, and to&#xD;
utter those first simple combinations that were to be to&#xD;
him in after years the key to knowledge. His aptitude&#xD;
and docility rendered commands and punishments un-&#xD;
necessary. His attention seldom wandered but when&#xD;
puss coaxingly rubbed alongside, inviting. a brush from&#xD;
his familiar hand; and then a tap from Damie's knitting~&#xD;
needle, the extent of her penal administration, soon re-&#xD;
'called it.&#xD;

WALT]~R TRORNLEY OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
&#xD;
YEARS passed, and Walter, having ~acquired all that&#xD;
Damie could teach, was not slow to apply the key with&#xD;
which she had furnished him. The Bible, almost the&#xD;
only book she was acquainted with, notwithstanding&#xD;
that she had used it as one of primary instruction, he&#xD;
continued to peruse with interest, if not with "spirit-&#xD;
ual discernment." The wonders it unfolded, the hero-&#xD;
ism, suffering, and fidelity it recorded, expanded his&#xD;
young mind, while Mr. Grafton was careful to impress&#xD;
the lessouwbich might else have escaped his perception,&#xD;
and to direct his excited sensibilities to the Being whose&#xD;
c~c~er it revealed. There were not then, as now,&#xD;
books for- all ages; and, when Walter humbly requested&#xD;
"something. to read," ~k. Grafton despairingly raised&#xD;
his i~yes to his well - filled shelves, where ancient and&#xD;
modern tongues poured forth their treasures, but only&#xD;
for those who had earned them. by hard and patient&#xD;
study.&#xD;
The eager desire of Walter for knowledge was not,&#xD;
however, to remain unsatisfied. It became an addition-&#xD;
al tie between him and his guardian, who, thus won from&#xD;
his more dignified pursuits to the personal instruction of&#xD;
a child, supplied by oral teaching the deficiencies of thc&#xD;
period. This was fortunate for both; It withdrew Mr.&#xD;
Grafton from occupations which, if they could not e~-&#xD;
tinguish his sympathies, prevented their full exercise;*&#xD;
and it brought Walter's mind into more frequent com-&#xD;
munion with one not less pure and good than it was&#xD;
rich and beautiful.; and while Mr: Grafton created or&#xD;

ence or notiof original propensities~a correspondence in&#xD;
his pupil with his own poetic temperament, which open-&#xD;
ed a new source of sympathy, he thought he could al-&#xD;
ready discern, too, the germ of a character sufficiently&#xD;
strong to resist the illusions it loves.&#xD;
As Walter's mind advanced, Mr. Grafton fed it "with&#xD;
food convenient ;" and study, hard, pains-taking study,&#xD;
succeeded to the hitherto less arduous method. Diffi-&#xD;
culti~~ only increased his zeal. They were surmounted&#xD;
with an case that at once surprised and gratified his in-&#xD;
structor; but, nevertheless, Mr. Grafton was sometimes&#xD;
doubtful if an education so entirely secluded did not ex)&#xD;
ceed the injunctions imposed on him. He feared, too&#xD;
its effect on the temper of the boy, who, though~ both&#xD;
fearless and kind, was exclusive and self-depend~~ to a&#xD;
degree not consistent with the ordinary condition of&#xD;
man? which makes it at once a necessity and a virtue to&#xD;
confide in his fellows.&#xD;
Though a small settlement in a rude country, there&#xD;
was of course-being in New England-a school. To&#xD;
this Walter was now sent, not so much for its ostensible&#xD;
advantages as to bring him into union, and peradventure&#xD;
into collision, with those of his own age. Here he was&#xD;
soon distinguished by, his industry, quickness, and obe-&#xD;
dience. His truth, courage, and generosity had their&#xD;
natural efffect on his companions. He was on ood&#xD;
terms with all, but a certain sense of uncongeniality oTt /&#xD;
both sides prevented intimacy. Yet he mingled in the&#xD;
usual sports of his age; for which his fine physique well&#xD;
fitted him; and such were his fairness and good-nature&#xD;
t~hat, though generally excelling, he excited no envy.&#xD;
All yielded to Walter Thornley, whether at book or&#xD;
ball, as if the attempt were vain to outstrip one whom&#xD;
Nature had marked as her favorite.&#xD;
his fourteenth year was now completed, and it may&#xD;

be asked, had. no clue offered to the mystery that in-&#xD;
volved him? and was he himself aware of it'? So far&#xD;
froi~ a solution, the enigma was the more complete, in-&#xD;
asmuch as the remittances, gradually diminishing, had.&#xD;
soon ceased altogether. Though pained, as it regarded&#xD;
Walter, by this apparent desertion on the part of hi~&#xD;
natural friends, Mr. Grafton rejoiced for himself. Pecu-&#xD;
niary considerations were of little importance to him.&#xD;
Not rich, he had yet enough for the moderate wants of&#xD;
himself and his. ward, and could not deeply regret what&#xD;
seemed tO~ secure an undivided right, in one whom he&#xD;
felt daily 'more necessary to his happiness. In reply to&#xD;
the inquiries of Walter he had carefully avoided what-&#xD;
ever would excite a curiosity he ~ou1d not gratify. He&#xD;
had represented him as an orphan, because such he be-&#xD;
lieved him virtually to be; and, evading farther particw.&#xD;
lars, he hoped to preserve his mind, at least dt~ring its&#xD;
tender state, from a knowledge, the effect of which he&#xD;
dreaded on one of his temperament.&#xD;
But, though Walter acquiesced in the silence of his&#xD;
guardian, there were yet certain vague reminiscences&#xD;
lingering in his mind, like 'visions ctf a pre-existence1&#xD;
which strangely perplexed him, and which he cherished&#xD;
as persons of a' poetic imagination dwell upon their&#xD;
dreams, as something that carries them beyond the&#xD;
common and. the limited into the unrestricted regions&#xD;
of the ideal and the extraordinary, where they. mayin'&#xD;
dulge' in thought and emotion forbidden within the sober&#xD;
confines of reality. 'Like dreams, he feared that they,&#xD;
too, would vanish into insignificance if reduced to lan-&#xD;
guage, which seemed incapable of "'bodying" the faint&#xD;
traces, the scarce perceptible connections, the momentary&#xD;
associations, which caine and went like shadows over the&#xD;
surface of memory. , There were visions of a lady who&#xD;
smiled' and wept, who caressed and soothed; 'of spacious&#xD;

rooms, and beautiful wanderings among flowers; of lying&#xD;
on the soft grass that seemed to spread immeasurably&#xD;
around him; then of restraint and authority, and a tall,&#xD;
dark man; then of noise and fright, the dashing of wa-&#xD;
ters, and the roar of winds. Then all was a blank till.&#xD;
Mr. Grafton, Damie, and puss filled up the vacancy.&#xD;
How much of this could be traced to ori~nal first im-&#xD;
pressions; how much had been afterward supplied by&#xD;
ideas which, as the mind received them, fitted into and&#xD;
perfected its half-formed imagery, he. could not ascer-&#xD;
tain, nor did he desire to do so. It #vs a part of him-&#xD;
self; and as such he clung to it.&#xD;
Many circumstances of Walter's condition co-operated&#xD;
with these impressions, in giving that turn to his mind&#xD;
which, invidiously termed "romantic," is but another&#xD;
name for quick sensibilities and generous.impulses, cray-&#xD;
ing objects and opportunities above the comprehension&#xD;
or desire of ordinary, men. His secluded and simple&#xD;
habits left imagination to its own creations, unshackled&#xD;
by the forms of artificial life-the most effectual of seda-&#xD;
tives; at the same time that its freedom, invigorating to&#xD;
mind and body, preserved him from the sickly sentimen-&#xD;
tality of a dreaming boy. Without apprehensions of&#xD;
their Indian neighbors, many of whom were the subjects&#xD;
of religious instruction, and perfect in the woodcraft of&#xD;
the place, Walter, with his gun and dog, fearlessly roam-&#xD;
ed the forest which still closely skirted the village.&#xD;
There, threading its mazes, penetrating its deep recesses,&#xD;
looking up to catch the sunbeam that could scarce find&#xD;
its way to his path, or provoking its echoes with his&#xD;
rich musical voice, he was unconscious of ~ want.&#xD;
To this temper,. allied' to whatever was beautiful,&#xD;
Walter's 'reading had also contributed; some of which,&#xD;
if it answered no other end, at least preserved him from&#xD;
low associations and vulgar pleasures. Among gra'~rer.&#xD;

matter in Mr. Grafton's library, he had found records of&#xD;
that picturesque age which, as M. do Sismondi skeptical-&#xD;
ly asserts, always eluding out'investigation, is ever a lit-&#xD;
tle farther than we can penetrate. "Plus on ~tude&#xD;
l'histoire, et plus on voit que Ia chevalerie est une in-&#xD;
vention presque absolument po6tique; on n'arrive ja-&#xD;
mais ~. trouver par des documents authentiques la pays&#xD;
on. elle regnait: toujours elle est repr6sent6 ~ distance&#xD;
et pour les Ijeux et pour le tems." But to Walter, his&#xD;
imagination fired by the idea of devoted pages, trained&#xD;
in every gentle and manly service, and destined to a&#xD;
career of faith, humanity, and courtesy, it seemed as real&#xD;
as the skies above him.&#xD;
A favorite ramble of his was along the river, which,&#xD;
after passing near the village, proceeded for more than a&#xD;
mile beyond it in a tolerably direct course. It then&#xD;
took a sharper turn, and dashed over a rocky ledge, fall-&#xD;
ing from a height of fifty or sixty feet into a ravine,&#xD;
over the stony bottom of which it found its way into an-&#xD;
other part of the town, where a few houses were known&#xD;
as the "South End." Then, escaping from every ob-&#xD;
struction, it resumed its full and placid course till it pass-&#xD;
edfar be~ond'the bounds of Ashton. The richly-wood-&#xD;
e&amp;amp; sides of the ravine that shut in the river permitted a&#xD;
walk along it~ margin, by~which a fearless foot might&#xD;
gain the summit. Th~re, on one side, a small grassy plat&#xD;
closed in with trees a orded an inviting resting-place to&#xD;
the adventurer, whence he might gaze into the chasm, or&#xD;
be lulled to sleep by' the&#xD;
"Water's' fall with difference discreet,&#xD;
No~ soft, now loud."&#xD;
On both sides of the ledge over which the waters fell&#xD;
projecting i~nasses of rock had suggested the idea of a&#xD;
bridge, these furnishing secure abutments. But the&#xD;
arts were still young in Ashton. The trunk of a large&#xD;

tree which had accidentally fallen just beyond the cata-&#xD;
ract, and to which others had been added, served in place&#xD;
of a more arti~Icial structure to thosepersons with steady&#xD;
nerves, who, to save time, went by this shorter cut from&#xD;
Ashton to "South I~nd."&#xD;
The place had, too, its legend to add to its attrac-&#xD;
tions. Tn iTt conflict near it of two ho tile native tribes,&#xD;
the daughter of the vanquished chief; ll~tly pursued by&#xD;
the victors, to escape captivity was said to have thrown~&#xD;
herself from the rocks that~ overhupg the ravine. A.&#xD;
sycamore, not far from where she took the fatal leap,&#xD;
marked the spot. It was old, and the winds had played&#xD;
roughly with it; but as it reared its broken trii~nk and&#xD;
white branches above the underwood that partially con-&#xD;
cealed it, it justified, in the delusive lights and shadows&#xD;
of the night, the fancies of the country-folk; who, as&#xD;
the story ran, had often seen a gigantic phantom raising&#xD;
its arms, and in the act of precipitating itself into the&#xD;
abyss. Be this as it may, pity and superstition had con-&#xD;
secrated it.&#xD;
It was Walter's delight to pick his way along the&#xD;
~t6ne-strewed margin, till, having reached nearly the&#xD;
base of the fall, he contrived, by the aid of fissures, pro-&#xD;
jections, al d saplings-the tough nurslings of the rocks&#xD;
-to gain by zig-zag approaches the summit. There,&#xD;
throwing himself on the soft grass that seemed spread&#xD;
for his reception, a vague foreshadowing might some-&#xD;
times suggest to him that such was Iife-its high places&#xD;
only to be attained by hard and adventurous toil. Nor&#xD;
would his ardent young spirit have been discouraged by&#xD;
the admonition that, even when thus' gained, they are&#xD;
often, alas! like a scant and dizzy height, "too narrow&#xD;
for friendship, and too slippery for repose."&#xD;
But a~i exclusive companionship with nature, Mr.&#xD;
Grafton ~would not permit; and more for his pupil's ad-&#xD;

vantage than his own gratification, he0sought, as WaIter&#xD;
grew older, what society the place afforded. The pro.&#xD;
f~ssions were represented by the village pastor, lawyer,&#xD;
and physician. The~e~with their families, and a few&#xD;
others, served to cultivate those feelings without which&#xD;
our nature is stinted and but~ha1fgrowfl. They were&#xD;
all respectable men in their way. Dr. Mills, undisturbed&#xD;
by old or new schools of medicine, by allopathy, homceo-&#xD;
pathy, or Ihydropathy, killed and cured to the general&#xD;
satisfaction. Squire Whiting,' when he could not settle&#xD;
a ~difference amicably as a referee, fought the battle&#xD;
stoutly as an advocate. ,But first, in all respects, was&#xD;
good Dr. Jarvis. Those were the days of reverence, when&#xD;
the clergyman's well-worn black suit.-coat, breeches&#xD;
and worsted stockings his steel shoe.buckle~,,cane, and&#xD;
pocket~.comb; his rusty cocked hat, even from. its peg&#xD;
behind him in his pulpit on the SabbatI~, inspired more&#xD;
respect than the young of the present time are capable&#xD;
of feeling for any 'thing. It is fair to say, however, that&#xD;
Dr. Jarvis hadi stronger claims than even these. To&#xD;
much of the learning of his period and profession, he&#xD;
added a kindly nature and the manners of a gentleman.&#xD;
Though none could more, pertinaciously defend their&#xD;
tenets nor maintain a more uncompromising warfare&#xD;
with gainsayers, yet, when these had passed the confines&#xD;
of thisworld, there was none whose charity was so earn-&#xD;
est ~ devising an escape for them from the very fate he&#xD;
had denounced against them. His feelings, indeed, what-&#xD;
ever he might say-and he did 'say many things a~ hard&#xD;
to 'bear as to understand-were in charity with all men,&#xD;
and it was sometimes surmised that to indemnify him-&#xD;
self for what he d~jemed necessary severity to the living&#xD;
he dealt thus mer~iCully 'with the dead.&#xD;
It was not a small benefit that Mr. Grafton derived&#xD;
from his guardianship that he was thus drawn from a&#xD;

polemics with Dr. Jarvis, his disputed points of law with&#xD;
Squire Whiting, his incredulous but patient acceptance&#xD;
of Dr. Mills's remedies) and his hospitalities to all, the&#xD;
little courtesies of life wei7e kept alive.&#xD;
Among other apparently insignificant circumstances&#xD;
that went to make up the experience and character of&#xD;
Walter, was his intercourse with one who, though among&#xD;
the humblest in Ashton, filled a place that no one else&#xD;
could fill. This was Jed&amp;amp;Iiah Cooley, otherwise "Jed,"&#xD;
by which abbreviation he was universally 'known, to the&#xD;
practical oblivion of his patronymic. He had been a&#xD;
Revolutionary soldier, and was at this time a pensioner,&#xD;
and, moreover, peddler, fiddler, fisherman, sportsman,&#xD;
and songster. His fund of military anecdotes, of songs,&#xD;
and personal adventure, recommended him to the young,&#xD;
and, in addition to this, between himself an&amp;amp;Walter had&#xD;
been early' established certain sporting sympathies. He&#xD;
had been his instructor in all sylvan arts; services that&#xD;
had been well repaid, for, besides minor good offices,&#xD;
when a "season of sickness" had occurred.~a period to&#xD;
which Jed was fond of alluding.-...~Walter had proved&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
THE winter had been long and severe; and as the&#xD;
punishment of many acts of "downright presumption,"&#xD;
as Damie 'did not scruple to say, with the opening&#xD;
spring Mr.' Grafton was attacked by rheumatism so so-&#xD;
~verely as to call for more attention than he was disposed&#xD;
to pay to himself. Having resisted all domestic nos-&#xD;
trums, Damie, with equal confidence, asserted that it&#xD;
could only be cured by "the Pool"-the popular name&#xD;
then given to the Sulphur Spring at Lebanon. "Doc-&#xD;
tors' stuff," which, ~with a common inconsistency, she be-&#xD;
lieved in only when administered by herself; and of&#xD;
which she would have said, in the words of the quaint&#xD;

Lebanon was at the distance of nearly two days' jour-&#xD;
ney.~~~something of an undertaking to stay-at-home per-&#xD;
sons. It had, too, or was supposed to have, its perils.&#xD;
The road, through a hilly and rough country, was much&#xD;
neglected, and, as some reported, absolutely dangerous.&#xD;
This, however, was not one of the things of which Mr.&#xD;
Grafton made much account, though their good pastor,&#xD;
on the Sabbath preceding his departure, did think it ex-&#xD;
pedient to "put up," as the phrase went, prayers for his&#xD;
safe-conduct- a devout practice in keeping with the&#xD;
times, and ,one which the present generation, who trust&#xD;
themselves so recklessly to a blind and irresistible force,&#xD;
might do well to imitate.&#xD;

such comforts as in the then accommodations of the&#xD;
place might not be found, and with Walter as compan-&#xD;
ion, attendant, and driver, one fine day in the middle of&#xD;
June Mr. Grafton bade IDamie farewell, who, shading her&#xD;
eyes with l~er hand, looked after them as long as they&#xD;
could be seen, with more anxiety than is now manifest-&#xD;
4&#xD;
ed when a steamer parts its moorings for an Atlantic&#xD;
voyage.&#xD;
"Well,"~ 'said she, as she re-entered the house, and&#xD;
busied herself with its adjustment, "they ~re off-the&#xD;
Lord have marcy on 'em! Walter is a helpful lad, and&#xD;
will see that the cre'ters are well looked a'ter; but he&#xD;
can't do nothing' for the rheumatic'; and Mr. Grafton,&#xD;
take him out of his books, though he ~s the best man&#xD;
ever I see, isn't much."&#xD;
Ponder this, you who insist that knowledge, per se, is&#xD;
power.&#xD;
Toward the close of the second day they reached the&#xD;
little village of Lebanon, without any of the accidents&#xD;
that had been predicted.&#xD;
On the side of the high hill which rose above it two&#xD;
houses offered themselves for their accommodation, both&#xD;
sufficiently unpretending, but the lower one more invit-&#xD;
ing, because more accessible, the hill being very precip-&#xD;
itous. To this they directed their course as a first ap-&#xD;
plication, and, fielding such a promise of comfort as sat-&#xD;
isfied them, were content to remain. Wearied with his&#xD;
journey, Mr. Grafton soon retired, postponing till the&#xD;
next day an investigation of the place and the persons&#xD;
he might find there.&#xD;
A beautiful morning called our travelers to a view of&#xD;

&#xD;
out intervening veil to the far xnountain outline~ The&#xD;
primeval forest still held partial possession, and excluded&#xD;
mitch that has since been laid open to admiring eyes;&#xD;
but enough was even then to be seen to give an idea of&#xD;
the whole.&#xD;
A. visit to "the Pool" was the first business of the&#xD;
day. . I~here was found a little open i'eservoir, overshad-&#xD;
owed by trees, into which the spring poured itself; and&#xD;
around it on benches were seated.the patients, as if wait-&#xD;
ing for the angel who should "trouble the waters." In&#xD;
a few moments he appeared in the form of a fine, healthy,&#xD;
bare-footed boy, who, filling tumblers, presented them&#xD;
to such as desired it.&#xD;
At present, the chief recommendation of this water is&#xD;
its purity and softness; but at that periQd the belief in&#xD;
its, efficacy for many complaints was strong, and, more-&#xD;
over, confirmed by deposits of sulphur on the sides of&#xD;
the Pool in such quantities that people often gath-&#xD;
ered it to take with them on their return to their&#xD;
homes.&#xD;
* Mr. Grafton and Walter, both* quick observers, were&#xD;
speculating on the persons near them, chiefly plain coun-&#xD;
try-folk, who compared their cases and experience, the&#xD;
various doctors and remedies to which they had resort-&#xD;
ed, etc., etc., and were unanimous in the opinion that&#xD;
"the Pool" was better than all. While this was pass-&#xD;
ing, Walter's attention was attracted by the approach of&#xD;
a wagon, small and light enough to be drawn by hand,&#xD;
descending from the upper house. It was brought quite&#xD;
close to the Pool, and its occupant, a boy apparently&#xD;
eleven or twelve years old, was served with water.&#xD;
Walter observed that the servant who attended him&#xD;
supported him while he raised himself to drink. This,&#xD;
together with the extreme delicacy of his appearance7&#xD;
awakened his sympathy, and, approaching, contrary to&#xD;
&#xD;
his usual shyness toward strangers, he tried to find some&#xD;
occasion to speak to him. It soon offered. The little&#xD;
invalid dropped his handkerchief; the servant did not&#xD;
observe it, arid Walter hastened to pick it up and hand&#xD;
it to him. He received it with a smile, and by the mes-&#xD;
merism of youth a communication was established. The&#xD;
servant now drew near, took up the pole of the wagon,&#xD;
and they turned from the spring. It dragged heavily up.&#xD;
the steep ascent, and Walter, who had followed a few&#xD;
paces, extended a helping hand withoX~it speaking. It&#xD;
was not rejected, and they were soon a~ the dooY of the&#xD;
upper house. Here Walter was about to turn away, but&#xD;
the little, fellow said, with a wistful look and friendly&#xD;
tone, "Don't go !" and Walter lingered.&#xD;
Presently a lady appeared on the piazza and descend~~&#xD;
ed the steps. Bending over the wagon, she kissed the&#xD;
child tenderly, saying in a sweet German voice, "Guten&#xD;
morgen, mein liebes kind; how came you to desert me&#xD;
thus?"&#xD;
"Master Oscar wished, ma'am," said the servant, re-&#xD;
'spectfully removing his hat, "to surprise you by show..&#xD;
ing. how early he could be dressed, and how strong he&#xD;
is growing."&#xD;
"Yes, mamma," said the boy, eagerly, "Jam so strong&#xD;
I almost raised myself without Wilson's help."&#xD;
"Indeed I', exclaimed the lady. "Thank Heaven !"&#xD;
and again, with eyes full of love, she bent over him, and&#xD;
again she kissed him.&#xD;
Walter t~arned away, and hastily retraced his steps&#xD;
down the hill. He could not have very clearly defined&#xD;
his feelings, and he would have stoutly repelled any in-&#xD;
quiry into them. He only knew that never before had&#xD;
he so keenly felt that he had no mother's love.&#xD;
"Who is that fine-looking youth, Wilson ?" asked the&#xD;
lady.&#xD;

* The man professed his ignorance.&#xD;
"But, mamma," said Oscar, "we must find out. He&#xD;
ipso very good-natured. Do you know that he helped&#xD;
Wilson draw me up the hill? It was his own offer, too;&#xD;
no one asked him."&#xD;
"That was indeed very kind and thoughtful," she re-&#xD;
plied. "We will ascertain who he is when we next go&#xD;
to the spring."&#xD;
Meanwhile, Mr. Grafton, who had observed 'Walter's&#xD;
attention to the sick boy, turned to a gentleman at his&#xD;
side, aiid inquired who the child was. The question&#xD;
was addressed to the village doctor, in frequent attend-&#xD;
ance at the Pool, and, having been called professionally&#xD;
to the child on his arrival, was better able than any one&#xD;
else to answer it.&#xD;
"He is the son of a Mr. Middleton. The father is an&#xD;
Englishman; but, though his wife speaks English per-&#xD;
fectly, it is with a foreign accent, which I take to be&#xD;
German. Carriages, horses, and servants show them to&#xD;
be people of fortune, but they are quite tinassuming in&#xD;
their manners. She especially; he is one of your 'noli&#xD;
me tangere' people; but the son is a fine fellow."&#xD;
"Have they been long here ?"&#xD;
"About three weeks. They came for the health of&#xD;
their child, who, I understand, is the only survivor of&#xD;
four."&#xD;
"And is he likely to be benefited by the experiment?&#xD;
he is an interesting-looking boy."&#xD;
"Oh, too handsome! too handsome !" said the doctor,&#xD;
shaking his head. "I never like that complexion; but&#xD;
Ilie is mending, and, with good care, I think they may&#xD;
save him.",&#xD;
"Where do they reside?"&#xD;
"I believe near New York. They have been in this&#xD;
country some ten or twelve years, but he retains all his&#xD;
&#xD;
John Bull stiffness, and will, IL dare swe~tr, as long as he&#xD;
Jives."&#xD;
In the course of the day there was the same gathering&#xD;
at the Pool, and soon the wagon and the little boy ap-&#xD;
peared, accompanied by a lady leaning on the arm of ~,&#xD;
gentleman, whom Mr. Grafton rightly inferred to be Mr.&#xD;
and Mrs. Middleton. The relationship between her and&#xD;
Oscar would have been suggested by their strong mu-&#xD;
tual resemblance, except that, with the same clear blue&#xD;
eye, delicately-cut features, and profusion of silky light-&#xD;
brown hair, her' complexion, though fair, Ihad not thc&#xD;
fatal transparency through which that fate is seen, which&#xD;
so often attends those who seem like victims decked for&#xD;
sacrifice. Her sweet face and courteous manner were a&#xD;
passport to all hearts. Mr. Middleton, on the contrary,&#xD;
invited no approach. A fine person and gentleman-&#xD;
ly deportment made an immediate impression, but, be-&#xD;
yond what politeness required, he encouraged no inter-&#xD;
course.&#xD;
Oscar's eye eagerly sought Walter, whom having&#xD;
found, he pointed out to Mrs. Middleton, saying, earn-&#xD;
estly~ "Do, mamma, speak to him."&#xD;
She was on the point of advancing toward him, when&#xD;
her husband, perceiving her intention, restrained her,&#xD;
though very gently, and said, "Wilson, go to the young&#xD;
man, and request him to do Master Oscar the fav&amp;amp;r to&#xD;
come here."&#xD;
The message was delivered and obeyed. Oscar greet-&#xD;
ed Walter with a smile, and Mrs. Middleton, kindly ex-&#xD;
tending her hand, said, "I am happy that my son has&#xD;
formed such an acquaintance, but, that I also may share&#xD;
his pleasure, will you have the goodness to give me your&#xD;
name?"&#xD;
Walter felt as if he could give her his heart.&#xD;
"Walter Thornley, ma'am."&#xD;

"What a nice name I" exclaiiried Oscar, ready to ad-&#xD;
mi~re whatever belonged to his new friend.&#xD;
"Papa,' this is 'Walter Thornley."&#xD;
Mr. Middleton, whose attention had been otherwise.&#xD;
directed, turned rather suddenly at hearing himself thus&#xD;
addressed, looked inquiringly at the youth, then politely&#xD;
but coldly offered his hand, bn~ said nothing.&#xD;
"And I,', said Oscar, "am 0 car Middleton; now we&#xD;
know each other, don't we?" And so it seemed, not-&#xD;
'withstanding that a few hours previously they had been&#xD;
ignorant of each other's existence. Precious imtnunity&#xD;
of young hearts!&#xD;
Henceforth Walter's time was divided between attend-&#xD;
ance on Mr. Grafton and Oscar; and as the improvement&#xD;
in the former soon began to justify Damie's recommend-&#xD;
ation of the Pool, Walter was more at leisure to devote&#xD;
himself to the latter. His gentle ways; his I~and alway~&#xD;
in the right place in moving, lifting, and adjusting Oscar;&#xD;
that instinct by which even children often know how to&#xD;
adapt themselves to the suffering, rendered his services&#xD;
more acceptable than Wilson's; and Walter, in no long&#xD;
time became his most reliable attendant. Then his com-&#xD;
panionship was so amusing! He had so many things to&#xD;
tell of his wild wood-life, of his forest sports, and Indian&#xD;
traditions, that, in listening, Oscar's body grew stronger&#xD;
as his spirit became lighter.&#xD;
Though difference in years under other circumstances&#xD;
would have kept them asunder, it now served only to&#xD;
unite them by a sense of usefulness on one side, of reli-&#xD;
ance on the other. In addition to this, Oscar's delicate&#xD;
health had confined him 'so much to the society of those&#xD;
older than himself that he was sufficiently matured to&#xD;
value the superior attainments of Walter.&#xD;
A fortnight had thus passed, during which the inti-&#xD;
macy of the boys had drawn Mr. Grafton and the Mid-&#xD;

dietons together. Between himself and the lady a friend.&#xD;
ly, almost familiar intercourse was established, lie, as&#xD;
an invalid, excited her interest, and by attentions to him&#xD;
as such, she endeaVored to repay the really important&#xD;
services that Walter was rendering to her son. Then he&#xD;
*      had seen her country in his younger~ days; he under-&#xD;
stood its language and admired its literature, lie loved&#xD;
its music and its poetry; could sympathize with Kiop..&#xD;
stock's love for his 'KMIeta," and comprehend and pity,&#xD;
*      if he 'could not justify, the "Sorrows of Werter." Wal-&#xD;
ter, who had never seen his guardian in society so stimu.&#xD;
lasting, listened, and wondered at the new phase under&#xD;
which he appeared.&#xD;
In Mr. Middleton Mr. Grafton had scarcely less inter-&#xD;
est than in his wife, but it was of a very different char-&#xD;
acter. lie was to him a study, and a painful one.&#xD;
"His is not a handsome face," thought he one day&#xD;
when he had been long speculating on it; "no, not what&#xD;
is commonly so called, and yet, from its variety and_&#xD;
power, it rivets my attention beyond any I ever saw.&#xD;
Sometimes harsh almost to severity, then tender almost&#xD;
to sadness; never cheerful, yet occasionally bright with&#xD;
a gayety that seems to play but on the surface, and 're-&#xD;
minds one of sunshine upon ice-light without warmth.&#xD;
A man, II should say, of quick sensibilities-of strong&#xD;
impulses rather, than stern resolve-and yet sometimes&#xD;
he looks as if he could dare death in the pursuit of a&#xD;
purpose; yes, dare, perhaps, but not endure. His man~&#xD;
is as unce9~ain as is his face-always polite, though&#xD;
often cold to repulsiveness, he will yet suddenly surprise&#xD;
with a cordiality that embarrasses by its strangeness."&#xD;
That Mr. Grafton, on his part, should impress his new&#xD;
acquaintances favorably was to be expected. Gentleman&#xD;
was so indelibly stamped upon him that the most sus-&#xD;
picious and exacting could not distrust his claim to be&#xD;

thus considered, while the intellectual and spiritual char-&#xD;
acter of his f~ice spoke to whatever was high arid holy&#xD;
inThose with whom he held communication. Simple as&#xD;
a child in his manners-reserved from modesty, not pride&#xD;
-there was. no artificial barrier to the fountain within.&#xD;
He was no egotist; he could not speak of himself or his&#xD;
interests; but though he did not offer his own heart to&#xD;
the inspection of others, he never withheld from them&#xD;
his sympathy.&#xD;
While Mr. Grafton found matter for reflection in his&#xD;
new acquaintances, Walter was not less observant. Al-&#xD;
ternately attracted and repelled by Mr. Middleton-hard-&#xD;
ly knowing whether or noV he liked him-he was yet&#xD;
ConSCiOUS of an uneasy interest attaching to whatever he&#xD;
said or did. On the other hand, Mrs. Middleton inspired&#xD;
him with emotions as delightful as new. Her beauty,&#xD;
her manner, invested eyen ordinary actions with a charm.&#xD;
But when she caressingly leaned over her son, when she&#xD;
laid her soft fair hand on, his head, or turned his light&#xD;
cnrls over her fingers, a strange undefined feeling of des-&#xD;
olatene8s would come over him, while he gazed with such&#xD;
sad admiring, eyes as on one occasion caught the atten-&#xD;
tion of Mr. Middleton, and Walter felt a rough rap on&#xD;
his shoulder. Looking up, he saw that gentleman re-&#xD;
garding him with a smile unusually mirthful.&#xD;
"Take care, young sir," exclaimed he, "you must not&#xD;
fall ~in love with my wife."&#xD;
"I don't know what you mean, sir," replied Walter,&#xD;
in all simplicity.&#xD;
Again Mr. Middleton smiled. "Oh I am not at all jeal-&#xD;
ous, I assure you-rather pleased with your involuntary&#xD;
homage ;~ but"-shaking his head-" I see there is a very&#xD;
soft place in your heart, my boy. I hope you may not&#xD;
some day find it out to your cost."&#xD;

A PEEP AT TILE PAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
THE health of Oscar rapidly improved; the pure,&#xD;
bracing mountain air probably the chief agent in his' re-&#xD;
covery. The symptoms that had filled his parents with&#xD;
apprehensions of spinal disease had nearly disappeared,&#xD;
and the doctor could ~honestly assure them that he was&#xD;
thus far safe. He now sat up without support, and&#xD;
moved about with only the assistance of an arm, or a&#xD;
cane; but Walter, even more necessary ,to him as a com-&#xD;
panion, still passed part of every day at the upper house.&#xD;
One morning when he and Mr. Grafton had, as usual,&#xD;
joined their friends on the piazza, where Mrs. Middleton&#xD;
was seated at her tambour-frame, and her husband, after&#xD;
a short conversation, turned again to 'his newspaper,&#xD;
Walter found a place at a table, where, among other&#xD;
things scattered on it, lay a large open book richly illus-&#xD;
trated, over which Oscar was poring.,&#xD;
"Oh !" said he, "I'ni~ so glad you've come. Here is&#xD;
something that mamma packed up for my entertainment,&#xD;
that I have been so wishing to show you, but it has not&#xD;
been taken out till to-day. It is 'full of the queerest&#xD;
things; just look !"&#xD;
It was a work on Heraldry, and Walter was as eager&#xD;
to see as 'Oscar to exhibit.&#xD;
"This is the very thing !" said he. "It will explain&#xD;
'what I have read of; but you must help me to under-&#xD;
~stand it."&#xD;
Delighted to be able to teach Waltr any thing, Oscar&#xD;
poured forth his little store, accompanied with a modest&#xD;
disclaimer.&#xD;
"Indeed I don't know much about it myself as I have&#xD;

only looked it over once with mamma; but we will help&#xD;
each other."&#xD;
"They were soon deep in the book with its quaint and&#xD;
antiquated Norman terms, which Oscar, with an amusing&#xD;
complacency, repeated for the instruction of Walter.&#xD;
"Field, ordinaries and charges, chef, fess, and base; bends&#xD;
and ehev~3rQn. Party my coups, and coupA my party.&#xD;
Parti per chef per fess, and per bend; or, argent, gules,&#xD;
vert, pellets, bezants, torteaux, ermine, and vair." Lions&#xD;
in every fantastic attitude; stags' and bulls' heads caboss-&#xD;
ed; leopards, eagles, and dolphins; battle-ax~s, spears,&#xD;
and daggers; helmets, crests, devices, and lambrequins;&#xD;
gauntlets and greaves; crosses in every conceivable va-&#xD;
riety; roses and fleurs-de-lis; cups, baldricks, and horns,&#xD;
etc., etc.&#xD;
"And eare all these strange things significant ?" asked&#xD;
Walter.&#xD;
"To be sure," answered Oscar, with the confidence of&#xD;
an amateur; "at least they were so once. Perhaps they&#xD;
make coats of arms now to suit people's fahcy, and crowd&#xD;
every sort of thing into them, for the book says the most&#xD;
simple are the most ancient. Here now is one, 'parti&#xD;
per phle, argent and gules'-.-nothing more-that means&#xD;
divided perpendicularly, one half white, the other red,&#xD;
and it belongs to one of the oldest families. Mamma&#xD;
says this is as it should be; for the best-horn persons are&#xD;
the least ostentatiou5'~&#xD;
They continued to turn over the leaves quietly, till&#xD;
Oscar exclaimed, "Ahi hereis something would suit me&#xD;
nicely. See! 'Falcon dose,' confined to its perch, and&#xD;
'Falcon rising,' with wings just beginning to spread&#xD;
themselves-not yet fairly off-I'd take that if I had&#xD;
to choose. I am leaving my perch; by-and-by I'll&#xD;
fly!"&#xD;
"And what does this queer little dumpy bird mean?"'&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT TIlE PAST.&#xD;
"'Dumpy bird!"' repeated Oscar; "why, that's a&#xD;
martlet, mid never has any feet, because it was given to&#xD;
younger sons, who had no land to stand on."&#xD;
"Oh, then, that would do for me," said Walter.&#xD;
"And why for you? You h~ve no older brothers,&#xD;
have you?"&#xD;
nor no land neither; I am 'Walter the penni-&#xD;
less.&#xD;
"Well, they say I am to have plenty of land, but I&#xD;
would give it all for a brother. AhI here is one would&#xD;
suit mamma, 'a pelican wounding herself to feed her&#xD;
young;' that is ,just what she would do."&#xD;
Mr. Grafton, seated by Mrs. Middleton, had engaged&#xD;
her in conversation, but it flagged as her ear caught the&#xD;
sounds from Oscar's table; and, as he uttered the last&#xD;
words, he observed a sigh to escape her, and her moist-&#xD;
ened eye turned to her son.&#xD;
"Ah ha!" continueed Oscar, with emphasis, and in a&#xD;
higher key, "here is something we haven't got, and we&#xD;
don't want-d~o we ?" Then, lowering his voice, he whis-&#xD;
pered to Walter an explanation, who replied by a nod&#xD;
of intelligence.&#xD;
Oscar's louder tone had roused his father, who, catch.&#xD;
ing his last words, laid down his paper, and said, "Pray&#xD;
what is that, my boy, which you neither have nor want?&#xD;
I am glad you are so reasonable. We generally desire&#xD;
most what we have not; what is it?"4&#xD;
Oscar looked a little foolish; his father repeated the&#xD;
question, ~nd he replied, "A '&amp;amp;dton sini.stre,' papa."&#xD;
A cloud came over Mr. Middleton's face, and in a man-&#xD;
ner almost fierce, he said, "Who has dared to put such&#xD;
ideas into you.r head? Has Wilson presumed to in~&#xD;
strict you? ~i&#xD;
"Dear papa," said Oscar,. "Wilson does not under.&#xD;
stand heraldry, you know."&#xD;

"Who, then," repeated his father in the same tone,&#xD;
"has given you this superfluous information, filling your&#xD;
mind with-"&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton had risen from. her frame and ap-&#xD;
proached h~r husband, and now, putting her hand gently&#xD;
on his sh~dlder, said, "If there can be a fault in a mat-&#xD;
ter so trifling, it is mine. Oscar asked me for an ex-&#xD;
planation, which .1 gave9 Ii always tell him the truth."&#xD;
Her voice, her touch1 were enough. Subdued at once,&#xD;
he took her hand, raised it to his lips, and said, "You&#xD;
are always right; I am always wrong."&#xD;
"Not so, dear Godfrey. But if sometimes wrong, as&#xD;
we all are-always generous and ready to atone, which&#xD;
all are not."&#xD;
He replied only by repeating the word "atone" in a&#xD;
low voice, and then resumed his paper9&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton, without apology or explanation, or ap-&#xD;
parent consciousness that such might be required, return-&#xD;
ed quietly to her work, and the boys tried to busy them-&#xD;
sel.ves in their book.&#xD;
But the harmony of the morning was not to be re-&#xD;
stored, and, as soon as could be done without betraying&#xD;
the reason, Mr. Grafton reminded Walter of the hour,&#xD;
and~they withdrew.&#xD;
As they descended the bill Walter said, "Mr. Mid-&#xD;
dleton is a strange pei'son. Do you not think, sir, that&#xD;
he is a little insane? His coachman, I understand, says&#xD;
(for Wilson is more guarded) that he sometimes keeps&#xD;
his room, where no one, not even his wife, goes near&#xD;
him. And then he is so uncertain! At times he makes&#xD;
me feel as if I could do any thing for him, and then&#xD;
again he is so strange that it seems as if his mind could&#xD;
not be sound."&#xD;
'KN~o, I do not think so. He is rather the spoiled&#xD;

human inconsistencies, Walter, to insanity, we should&#xD;
make the world a 'maison des fous.'"&#xD;
Yet, notwithstanding this interpretation, Mr. Grafton&#xD;
did hot wholly reject Walter's suggestion, which tended&#xD;
to increase his interest in the family, and his regret for&#xD;
his departure, which, as he was now quite restored? was&#xD;
to take place in a few days.&#xD;
The next morning, as Oscar was sitting by his mother,&#xD;
he said, "I want~ you to ask papa to do me a great favor."&#xD;
"Why not ask him yourself; my son&#xD;
"Because he never refuses you any thing."&#xD;
"Nor you, Oscar, if it 'be proper."&#xD;
"Well, this is proper; and yet I am afraid. I know&#xD;
papa loves me-but--.--sometimeshe speaks so-"&#xD;
"Your father has much to trouble him, and we all&#xD;
have our faults, Oscar. We must love our friends with&#xD;
them, since we can not have them without."&#xD;
"You have none, mamma-.."&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton would have checked, him, but he pro-&#xD;
ceeded, "No, no, you have no faults! You are kind to&#xD;
every body, and Wilson says all the poor people say&#xD;
you are an angel."&#xD;
"Oh, my child, it is easy to earn such commendations&#xD;
from those who are starving. A. full meal, fuel, and a&#xD;
little money will lend wings to 4~ny common mortal."&#xD;
"Perhaps so; but their wings drop off when they come&#xD;
to the light, like the man's who went too near the sun;&#xD;
but yours only look brighter."&#xD;
"Stop, stop, little flatterer! and tell me what is the&#xD;
great favor you are wanting."&#xD;
"It is that papa would invite Walter to go home with&#xD;
u~-oniy for a visit, I mean."&#xD;

"INo-well, I will do what I can for you, unless you&#xD;
will ask- yourself-that is be~t, believe inc. Your £a-~&#xD;
ther never refused you a reasonable gratification."&#xD;
A 14~w days after, Mr. Grafton and Walter called to&#xD;
take leave, and the visit, which all seemed equally un-&#xD;
willing to terminate, being ended with an exchange of&#xD;
regrets and good wishes, Mr. Middleton said, as they rose&#xD;
to go, "We will, if you please, leave the boys here a&#xD;
few moments, while you indulge me with a walk on the&#xD;
pia7~Za."&#xD;
"I have," he continued, when they were alone, "a re-&#xD;
quest to prefer in behalf of Oscar, but one in which Mrs.&#xD;
MiddletoiL and myself take part. We wish you to al-&#xD;
loW Walter to remain here, and to return with us to our&#xD;
home.. We shall be grateful for as long a visit from him&#xD;
as e~u consent to."&#xD;
"You are all very good," replied Mr. Grafton, some-&#xD;
what embarrassed by the unexpected proposal, "so good&#xD;
that I grieve to say no. But I can not at present part&#xD;
with him. The conditions of my guardianship are rig-&#xD;
id, and I must conform to them."&#xD;
Mr. Middleton looked disappointed.&#xD;
"Were you like some men I might urge you," he&#xD;
said; "but I ani so well assured of your desire to give&#xD;
happiness that II am satisfied you decline to do so only&#xD;
for sufildent reasons- But if not now, some other time:&#xD;
and one word more; your nephew has interested us not&#xD;
Gnly by his kind attentions to our son, but by his un-&#xD;
common gifts. Have you decided on his future? Can&#xD;

"Not all I could wish, of Course, but more, perhaps,&#xD;

as far as youths of his age in a country where~a classical&#xD;
education is much behind that to be obtained, and there~&#xD;
fore required, in yours; and in his reflective powers ho&#xD;
is far beyond them. His mind is more than usually im-&#xD;
pressible, and gathers from books and from every ex-4&#xD;
ternal object with no other stimulant than its own en-&#xD;
ergy. As to his future, that does not depend on me;&#xD;
I have little fear, however, but that he will make a way&#xD;
to usefulness, and that is the best distinction."&#xD;
Mr. Middleton looked as if he wished, yet did not know&#xD;
~iow, to proceed. At length he said,&#xD;
"Iwill not farther press this matter at present, but if&#xD;
at any time money should be necessary-I have no in..&#xD;
fluence in this country, you know-call on me. Here&#xD;
is my address. Pardon me if I am impertinent."&#xD;
"My dear sir, you are only generous beyond all claim,&#xD;

disposed to ~~ak of my own affairs. Should his re-&#xD;

I will only beg you to preserve for us your good-will&#xD;

At ~an early hour the next day, after another farewell&#xD;
to Oscar, who had insisted on being at their lodgings for&#xD;
the purpose, Mr. 0-rafton and Walter '~ere on their way&#xD;
homeward&#xD;
The morning was exquisite; and Mr. Grafton, reno-&#xD;
vated in health, gratified with the acquaintance they had&#xD;
made, from which he hoped some future good to his&#xD;
ward, and w~ll pleased to return to his quiet home, cast&#xD;
a cheerful glance around him, and Walter endeavored to&#xD;
shake off regretful feelings.&#xD;

"May I ask what you said, sir?"&#xD;
I had only to tell the truth, and confess myself not&#xD;
at liberty to consent. Would you like to go?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir; but you know best, I dare say."&#xD;
Still Walter did not look satisfied. After a silence&#xD;
of some time, and divers, unconscious applications of his&#xD;
whip, which, considering his horses were doing their best&#xD;
up a long hill, probably seemed to them quite unneceS~&#xD;
sary, he said,&#xD;
"I should like to ask you a question, sir."&#xD;
"As many as you please, Walter."&#xD;
"Then why did you say you were 'not at liberty to&#xD;
consent?' You, only, have the control of my actions."&#xD;
"Oh I well, perhaps I did not use to Mr. Middleton&#xD;
just that form of expression.&#xD;
"But you Jo to me, sir; and it is why you use it at&#xD;
all that I wish to know."&#xD;
"You are critical, Walter," said Mr. Grafton, with a&#xD;
smile. "iDo we not often so express inability? We re-&#xD;
gret that we have not the power to do a thing, which is&#xD;
just the same."&#xD;
"Perhaps so, sir; but when you have sometimes re-&#xD;
fused a request of mine, you may have said you could&#xD;
not comply, but it was never in a way to imply th~t you&#xD;
~&amp;amp;uld not if you chose to do~ so."&#xD;
"Guardians are often restricted in certain particulars.&#xD;
Be assured that I shall never interpret my limits too&#xD;
rigidly. For the present we will say no more about it."&#xD;
But it was not so easy to repress in Walter's mind the&#xD;
train of thought that had been suggested.&#xD;
I~ear the decline of the next day, Pamie, having been&#xD;
forewarned of their approach, received them at the door-&#xD;

~"gloriosa." She had advised the journey! she had pre-&#xD;

Why, you are as spry, sir, as Walter; and he, too, though&#xD;
he was parfeetly well when he went, he, too, is better&#xD;

42           WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
THE summer passed; but, though Walter attended to&#xD;
the cares that, as he grew into greater trust, devolved&#xD;
upon him, and failed in no respect in his accustomed&#xD;
application to study, Mr. Grafton. saw with regret that&#xD;
his boyish happiness seemed yielding to a thoughtful-&#xD;
ness which, always in some degree natural to him, had&#xD;
of late become so prevailing as to suggest some special&#xD;
cause. Still, as he made neither communication nor&#xD;
incjuiry, Mr. Grafton, whatever he might conjecture,&#xD;
thought it best to defer the revelation which he was&#xD;
aware must soon be given. This was unexpectedly&#xD;
hastened. One evening, as he was reading, and Walter&#xD;
was, or affected to be, occupied in like manner, he sud-&#xD;
denly turned to his guardian, and said, "Are you my&#xD;
uncle, sir?"&#xD;
Off his guard at this unlooked-for inquiry, Mr. Graf-&#xD;
ton instinctively answered, "No, Walter,"&#xD;
"What relationship, then, is there between us&#xD;
~' None whatever.',&#xD;
With a strong effort to suppress his emotion, Walter&#xD;
said, in a proud and injured tone, "Then I have been&#xD;
deceived for twelve years. 'Tis time, sir, to deal differ-&#xD;
ently with me."&#xD;
"My dear boy, the deceit of which you complain, if&#xD;
it indeed, deserves so harsh a name, has been most re-&#xD;
luctant on my part. I have only sought to defer 'what&#xD;
would give pain. But you are right. The time for&#xD;
concealment is past. Take this seat by me, and I will&#xD;
give you such facts as are in my possession."&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
Walter did so; the story was told in few words, but&#xD;
many would fail to express its effect on the hearer. His&#xD;
intense gaze, his changing color, his quivering lip and&#xD;
heaving chest, better told the conflict of, emotions that&#xD;
shook him. For some time he could not speak. His&#xD;
first words were those of gratitude. Convulsively press-&#xD;
ing Mr. Grafton's hand, he could only say, "My father I"&#xD;
and the effort brought tears to his relief.&#xD;
Mr. Grafton, unwilling to infuse his own distrust into&#xD;
Walter's mind, had been careful to express no opinion&#xD;
'S&#xD;
of the person by whom he had been committed to his&#xD;
care, while ignorant of the relationship subsisting be-&#xD;
tween them.&#xD;
"Has he never written ?" asked Walter, at length.&#xD;
"sever."&#xD;
"But the promised remittances-he surely sent them ?"&#xD;
"For a short time."&#xD;
Walter's countenance fell.&#xD;
"How do you explain.theii~failure, sir?"&#xD;
"I can not, otherwise than by supposing that he may&#xD;
1&#xD;
be no ionge~ living.,~&#xD;
Walter shuddered.&#xD;
"Dead!" he exclaimed, "and all ~.knowledge dying&#xD;
with him! Oh, it can not be! do not, do not say so!"&#xD;
"I only suggest a possibility; there may be other&#xD;
and excellent reasons. We must hope the best."&#xD;
But distress,* doubt, fear, spoke in Walter's face. He&#xD;
longed to ask if Mr. Grafton believed this person to be&#xD;
his father, but he could not; he dreaded,' he knew not&#xD;
why, to have the idea confirmed. He only asked that&#xD;
he would more minutely describe his appearance.&#xD;
Mr. Grafton did so.&#xD;
"The saAie! the' same !" exclaimed Walter, as if from&#xD;
some secret recess of memory an image came forth,&#xD;
bringing with it, too, dim recollections of endearments&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7727-00000024"/>&#xD;
44           WALTER THOIVNLEY; OR,&#xD;
that had won his infant confidence; and he softened to-&#xD;
w~rd one who, a moment before, had repelled him.&#xD;
But with these came also a fear, and his heart fainted&#xD;
within him.&#xD;
"Perhaps it is better I should never know," thought&#xD;
he. "I may only hear my birth to blush for it."&#xD;
Mr. Grafton, tenderly regarding him, easily divined&#xD;
the doubts, the conjectures, the apprehensions that pass-&#xD;
ed like shadows over his expressive face, but he forbore&#xD;
to avow his participation in them.&#xD;
"My dear b'oy," said he, affectionately laying his&#xD;
hand on his head, and stroking the rich hair from his&#xD;
brow, "let us talk no more at present, it is late; but&#xD;
henceforth we shall have no secrets from each other."&#xD;
A beautiful autumn came, glorious with its yellow&#xD;
lights and gorgeous foliage; and, animated by its brac&#xD;
ing influences, Walter seemed more like himself than he&#xD;
had of late done. With his gun on his shoulder, his&#xD;
lunch in his pocket, and followed by Peto, a mongrel,&#xD;
with a strong infusion of bull, unfit for sport, but great&#xD;
as a gnard or companion, and one who would not be re-&#xD;
pulsed, he set off for a day in the woods.&#xD;
On his return home, finding himself near the lower&#xD;
termination of the ravine, the fancy took him to climb its&#xD;
precipitous side as he had often done; but what should he&#xD;
do with Peto, who had been more a plague than pleasure&#xD;
during the day, and would here be a serious encum-&#xD;
brance? A neighbor lad who was passing by the usual&#xD;
route to the village offered to relieve him both of dog&#xD;
and gun, and Walter, sharing with him his game, con-&#xD;
sented, Peto going off with the air of a dismissed ofli-&#xD;
cial conscious of incompetency. Then, winding his way&#xD;
up the ravine, he put forth his strength and agility to&#xD;
the task of reaching the summit. Having gained it, he&#xD;
threw himself panting and excited on' a bed of lea~res&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PASt              45&#xD;
with which a slight frost had strewn the ground, and&#xD;
surrendered himself to the tranquilizing influences&#xD;
around him.&#xD;
A soft vapory haze was spread Over the declining&#xD;
day, rendering nature..-~-like a lovely woman seen through&#xD;
a transparent veil-even more lovely. The woods had&#xD;
put their glory on-.&#xD;
"Oh, Autumn! why so soon&#xD;
Depart the hues that make the forest glad?"&#xD;
There were no discQrdant sounds, but through the&#xD;
still air was heard the murmur from the ravine, and the&#xD;
distinct but gentle dropping of the golden leaves that&#xD;
the fros1~ had disengaged. Walter watched them as they&#xD;
fell till dreamy thoughtfulness came over him. To&#xD;
this succeeded a sense of loneliness, suggested by the&#xD;
companPrnship that seemed to pervade all nature. The&#xD;
hum of insects told of numbers; the birds that twittered&#xD;
among the trees that shaded him were arranging a social&#xD;
southern trip when the shorter days should come; a cow&#xD;
that had broken bounds, and had found some green&#xD;
spots near him, from time to time gave a motherly call&#xD;
to her silly calf who had strayed too far from her; even&#xD;
the senseless i~iver at his feet seemed hosting to some&#xD;
"meeting of the waters," as if willing to lose itself so&#xD;
that it might mingle with others.&#xD;
"Nothing is alone but myself;" sighed Walter.&#xD;
Wearied with his day's ramble, reverie soon disposed&#xD;
to sleep, and he was transported to the "land of dreams."&#xD;
lie there appeared still to lie on his cliff-top bed, while&#xD;
groups of happy children and caressing mothers were&#xD;
near him. Lambs gambled about their dams, and pa-&#xD;
rent.birds were feeding their nestlings in the trees; but&#xD;
none cared for him, or even seemed conscious of his&#xD;
presence. He was alone, in the midst of life and love.&#xD;
l3Y~and-by a cloud intervened, and all were gone. While&#xD;

46           WALTER Tll0RNL1~ OR,&#xD;
he lamented, it parted, and. disclosed the image th~ had&#xD;
hunted his childhood-a tall, dark man, with eyes bent&#xD;
on him that penetrated to his heart, and weighed on him&#xD;
like a nightmare. Tile tried to move-he was transfixed&#xD;
by their gaze.&#xD;
The low growl of a dog broke the spell, and he awoke&#xD;
to behold that very face leaning over him; and Peto,&#xD;
who had eluded the custody to which he had been com-&#xD;
mitted, guarding him with an air of defiance.&#xD;
Walter raised himself on his elbow, laid a restraining&#xD;
hand on Peto, and turned a full, undaunted look on the&#xD;
stranger.&#xD;
"Waiter Thoruley?" he asked.&#xD;
"Yes" saidWalter.&#xD;
"I thought so. But you do not and can not know me."&#xD;
Years had left their mark on that face, but there were&#xD;
still th~ same strong features, the same singular expres-&#xD;
sion that had, a~s it were, burned itself into his infant mind.&#xD;
Naturally tenacious of all impressions, and rendered still&#xD;
more so by a life so quiet and unvarying as to produce&#xD;
but few, Walter gazed on him with a clear conviction of&#xD;
his identity. He had risen, and, standing erect with&#xD;
arms crossed upon his breast, as if to control the beat-&#xD;
ing of his heart, and endeavoring to speak with compo-&#xD;
sure, lie said deliberately,&#xD;
it was evident that the stranger was unprepared for&#xD;
fiiis reply, and he returned a look of rather displeased&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
"Know me V and as what? or whom ?'~&#xD;
"As one with whom I have some mysterious connec-&#xD;
tion. Oh, give me a name bi.~T which to call you 1,,&#xD;
Surxreyiiig Walter from head to foot in silence, and&#xD;
with an expression difficult to define, though certainly&#xD;
inquisitorial and severe, his face at length melted into a&#xD;
&#xD;
'p&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
smile meant to inspire confidence, and he replied, "You&#xD;
dtall know me, and for your best friend. There, give&#xD;
me your hand. Now let us be seated. Here is a rock&#xD;
that will serve for our purpose. I have something to&#xD;
say, and not much time. First, let me express my. sat-&#xD;
isfaction with yourself-nay, hear me," continued he,&#xD;
in a less gentle tone; "I have the right, young man, to&#xD;
commend or to blame-reward or punish-therefore lis-&#xD;
ten without interruption. Your appearance, your air,&#xD;
your language, all indicate that my choice of a guardian&#xD;
was well made. Go on as you have begun, and success&#xD;
will be yours."&#xD;
"Success!" repeated Walter; "I want affection, confi-&#xD;
dence, and that which is not refused to the poorest-the&#xD;
knowledge of who and what I am."&#xD;
"And ~an any one," replied the stranger, with a sar-&#xD;
castic smile, "can any one better instruct you than your~~&#xD;
self? What makes your identity but your own mind;&#xD;
your ~wn consciousness? What can I tell you of Wal-&#xD;
ter Thornley that you do not know better than I do ?"&#xD;
"Oh, do not trifle with me !" exclaimed. Walter, no&#xD;
longer able to restrain his emotion. "I entreat you,&#xD;
I conjure you by every thing sacred to tell me what my&#xD;
heart is bursting to know-tell me what gives you a&#xD;
right over me? by what name I should call you? by&#xD;
what name should I know myself? Oh, tell me I" said&#xD;
he, with a gush of feeling that had little effect on his&#xD;
hearer.&#xD;
"Be calm, Walter. This0will not advance your ob-&#xD;
ject. I am not to be moved from a purpose by the tears&#xD;
of a boy. You must remain for such time as I alone&#xD;
shall decide in your present ignorance. I will only say&#xD;
that, if you do not thwart me, you shall eventually know&#xD;
all. If you do," he added, with a threatening aspect,&#xD;
'C&#xD;
you will never know. Be obedient~, be satisfied to re-&#xD;

&#xD;
main as I have placed you, and it will make the happi-&#xD;
ness of both; for let me tell you that we are each to the&#xD;
~other a destiny-for good or for evil, as you shall act."&#xD;
These words, uttered with a look and tone that sent&#xD;
a chill to Walter's heart, silenced him; but his spirit&#xD;
was working strongly within him. The authoritative&#xD;
and menacing o~ce, the cold-almost contemptuous-&#xD;
answers to his natural yearnings, the smile of irony at&#xD;
such a time, all repelled his confidence and roused his&#xD;
resentment. S rting to his feet, he exclaimed, in the&#xD;
impotent violent e 6f a boy, "I will know; you shall no&#xD;
longer trifle wit me&#xD;
Peto, a close observer, instinctively felt that all was&#xD;
not right. Fro the first he had cast a doubtful eye on&#xD;
this unknown visitor; but now, when he saw him rise,&#xD;
and lay an ar on Walter with a view1 to check his im-&#xD;
petuosity, a hostile growl, and a slight movement of his&#xD;
upper lip, indicated that he required but small en~r-&#xD;
agement to make an inconvenient member of the con-&#xD;
ference.&#xD;
"I advise you," said the stranger, with an angry glance&#xD;
of distrust at Peto, "to keep both yourself and your dog&#xD;
under better control; unless, indeed, you intend to use&#xD;
his fangs to effect the determination you have just ex-&#xD;
pressed."&#xD;
"Oh, sir 1" said Walter, cruelly wounded, "how can&#xD;
you speak to me in this manner? If you could only&#xD;
see my heart! You once treated me kindly. I have&#xD;
not forgotten it. I once looked on you as my only&#xD;
'friend. Oh !" exclaimed he, trying to take his hand,&#xD;
and. resentment subdued by those recollections, "oh,&#xD;
look at ni~, and speak to me differently !"&#xD;
The stranger was moved. He did not reject Walter's&#xD;
hand; he was silent for a moment; then, in a voice rough&#xD;
with the emotion he end~avorec1 to suppreSs, he said,&#xD;
&#xD;
"Pshaw! folly! enough of this. You have heard my&#xD;
conditions-'tis needless to repeat them. I have but one&#xD;
other thing to say. Your remittances have been irreg-&#xD;
ular; they may be so again, but you are never to make&#xD;
that a pretext for disobedience, or worse may follow.&#xD;
Here is something for the present-more will come."&#xD;
Then presenting a purse, which Walter unheeding let&#xD;
fall to the ground, and shaking himself loose from the&#xD;
grasp which would still have detained~him, he plunged&#xD;
into a thicket near them, and was soon seen crossing the&#xD;
rude bridge that spanned the ravine. Peto sprang after&#xD;
him, but, recalled by his master, he only tossed up his&#xD;
head, and, giving the short, angry bark by which dogs&#xD;
express their contempt at an unsatisfactory encounter,&#xD;
looked up in Walter's face to congratulate him.&#xD;
But he was in no mood to return it. The twilight&#xD;
had faded away, and the night that was settling on him&#xD;
seemed an emblem. of the greater darkness that now fell&#xD;
on his future. Throwing himself on the ground, bury-&#xD;
ing his face in his hands, he gave vent to the conflicting&#xD;
feelings with which he had thus far struggled. Again&#xD;
and again he reviewed the scene just passed; again h~&#xD;
repeated every word and studied every look. He could&#xD;
extract no comfort, no assurance.-nothing but that he&#xD;
was a helpless boy in the power of a hard man.&#xD;
Long he lay and bitterly he ruminated, till a lovely&#xD;
young moon peeping through the trees offered to light&#xD;
him home. He rose, and Peto, who had not left his&#xD;
side, gave a jump and a joyous bark but~~ as if sudden-&#xD;
ly recollecting himself; made a pounce upon the rustling&#xD;
leaves, and, extracting something, brought it with a wag&#xD;
of his tail to his master. It was the purse, of which&#xD;
salter had not thought since it dropped, and which he&#xD;
now took almost mechanically. It was heavy with gold,&#xD;
but he did not examine it.&#xD;

On reaching the house he found Damie just setting&#xD;
forth in search of him. Her troubled brow changed to&#xD;
a frown of displeasure as soon as she saw him safe.&#xD;
"What on airth, Walter, made you stay so? I ex-&#xD;

"What is the matter? What has happened ?"&#xD;
Walter could answer only by throwing himself into a&#xD;
chair, and saying, "I have seen him~! I have seen&#xD;
him!"&#xD;
"Whom, Walter? What can you mean&#xD;
£~Thatman!)~&#xD;
Mr. Grafton seated himself by him, took his hand, and&#xD;
forbore farther questioning till he had soothed him suf.&#xD;
ficiently to give voluntarily the particulars of the inter-&#xD;
view. He heard them indignantly; but chiefly intent&#xD;
on quieting Walter's fearful agitation, he said, gently,&#xD;
"Be comforted, my dear boy! We have still one thing&#xD;
t6 be thankful to ~iiim for: he has not separated us, as&#xD;
he might have done had it suited his purpose, and as&#xD;
remorselessly as he has now wounded you."&#xD;
"Separate me fr~xn you / He should have killed me&#xD;
first!"&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
51&#xD;
&#xD;
The next morning Mr. Grafton, not farther to excite&#xD;
Walter, went, alone to South End to make inquiries. A&#xD;
gentleman had arrived there on horseback late in the&#xD;
preceding afternoon ; had asked some questions as to&#xD;
roads, and the shortest walk to the upper village; had&#xD;
then set out on foot "to see the falls," as he said. He&#xD;
returned after sunset, immediately called for his horse,&#xD;
and went away. Nothing farther was known or could&#xD;
be heard of him.&#xD;
This occurrence proved an occasion of increased solic-&#xD;
itude to Mr. Grafton. Walter, though. always more&#xD;
thoughtful than boys of his age, had never been other&#xD;
than cheerful and happy. His temper, sweet and affec-&#xD;
tionate, was never ruffled by unreasonable or' capricious&#xD;
moods; always kind and obliging to others; unexacting&#xD;
and grateful for himself. But now Mr. Grafton remark-&#xD;
ed with pain that he was listless, gloomy, irritable, though&#xD;
never so to him; excited to stidden causeless ang~r, then&#xD;
even unr~asohably self-accusing----all indicating the rude&#xD;
shock his nature had received. Of the stranger he rare-&#xD;
ly sjoke: when he did soit was with a proud, defiant&#xD;
air.&#xD;

A PEEP AT TIlE PAST.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
ANOTHER interval, and Walter, who was left a fitful&#xD;
boy of fifteen-that sensitive age when, to the inexperi-&#xD;
enced observer, a sudden, strange perversity often seems&#xD;
to blight the sweet' promise of earlier years, now reap.&#xD;
pears, when nearly twenty-one. The interval) unmark-&#xD;
ed by any change in his external condition, by notice&#xD;
from the stranger, or even by the remittances that might&#xD;
have' been expected, had left a strong impression on&#xD;
himself. The irritation 'induced by his peculiar con-&#xD;
dition, acting on the susceptibility of youth, had sub-&#xD;
sided. The feVerish impatience of concealment, the fret~&#xD;
ful resistance of a power he could neither comprehend&#xD;
nor love, the galling sense of dependence, had all gradu-&#xD;
ally fallen under the control of reason. He had learned&#xD;
to look his situation in the face, and had even dared to&#xD;
form his own plans.&#xD;
"I belong to God and myself;" he had reflected.&#xD;
"There only IL am accountable for whatever powers&#xD;
have been intrusted to me, and IL will not waste them in&#xD;
a cowardly subservience to any human being. Nor&#xD;
will I permit my inner self to he the victim of cruelty&#xD;
and caprice. 'My mind to me a kingdom is.' There IL&#xD;
will reign supreme."&#xD;
These were no vain resolves, as was manifested by&#xD;
the fast maturing character of Walter. It might, in a&#xD;
different state of things, have been almost to lie' regret-&#xD;
ted that one so young should be so wise; his natural&#xD;
impulsiveness so repressed; the frank, confiding tern-&#xD;
per-.the beauty of youth--so checked. But he be-&#xD;
&#xD;
53&#xD;
&#xD;
lieved that it depended on himself alone to be saved&#xD;
from the palsying eft~ect of his condition.&#xD;
"IL have," he thought, "a solitary and hard path be-&#xD;
fore me; but, like the princess in the fairy tale~ IL must&#xD;
not falter, whatever threats assail me. IL may have niuch&#xD;
to bear; IL must, then, learn to be strong. IL mustbe my&#xD;
own counselor; IL must, therefore, keep my feelings in&#xD;
subjection, and to do so IL must keep them to myself."&#xD;
"My dear sir," said he one morning to Mr. Grafton,&#xD;
"I have completed my majority, and though IL can never&#xD;
sufficiently bless yotr kind guardianship, 'tis time to re~&#xD;
lieve you of it."&#xD;
Mr. Grafton looked at ~iim in silent surprise.&#xD;
"Yes, sir; this. Walter Thornley, who, as child, boy,&#xD;
and man, has given you so much trouble, rlust hence-&#xD;
forth take care of himself."&#xD;
"But, Walter-if IL understand you-hear me a mo-&#xD;
ment. My guardianship was restricted by no legal&#xD;
forms; it was to continue till those having, a natural&#xD;
right should claim you."&#xD;
"And how long, sir," replied Walter, with a cold&#xD;
smile, "do you suppose that would be? No; my reso-&#xD;
lution is taken. Forgive me if this has been done with-&#xD;
out consulting you; but IL felt I must act, ordie. lam&#xD;
not, however, so presumptuous, so self-confident as not&#xD;
to beg your continued guidance so far as to put me, if&#xD;
you can, in the right way, but go IL must~"&#xD;
"Go! where, Walter?"&#xD;
"Anywhere! anywhere from Ashton, that, left wholly&#xD;
to myself; IL may ascertain what IL car&amp;amp; do."&#xD;
Mr. Grafton, grieved as he was at this unexpected de-&#xD;
termination, saw, nevertheless, a purpose so fixed, that&#xD;
to resist might result in mutual unhappiness. The only&#xD;
thing to do was to try to guide it; and, revolving it in&#xD;
his mind, as Walter continued to urge its necessity, he&#xD;

&#xD;
WALTER THoRNLEY; OR,&#xD;
became in part a convert, in so far as to acquiesce in an&#xD;
attempt to carry out his wishes. Nothing short of that,&#xD;
he~saw, would &amp;amp;4isfy him; should it fail, he might be&#xD;
content to remain as he was.&#xD;
The first thing that occurred to Mr. Grafton was to&#xD;
enter him as a clerk in a lawyer's otllice in New York;&#xD;
in proposing which, he added, "The fee paid on such&#xD;
occasions is not large. I have at my command enough&#xD;
for that, and for your other expenses during your ap-&#xD;
prenticeship."&#xD;
"No, sir," said Walter. "To this moment I have&#xD;
been your pensioner. I can not be so hereafter. I will&#xD;
leave the law for a time, till I have by some means&#xD;
earned 'enough to pay my own way."&#xD;
"Walter 1" said Mr. Grafton, with much feeling, "you&#xD;
are wrong. You are trying to create new relations be-&#xD;
tween us. No longer father and child, we are to be&#xD;
debtor and creditor. The little I have is, and will be&#xD;
yours.. Why treat me thus?"&#xD;
Walter took his hand; he pressed it; he bent his&#xD;
head over it ; choked down the tears that were rising to&#xD;
his eyes, and, when he could speak, said every thing that&#xD;
gratitude and affection dictated, but remained unmoved&#xD;
in his decision.&#xD;
"It must be so. If you would see me a man, let me&#xD;
go, sir, and in my own way."&#xD;
The next thing thought of was to write to Mr. Mid-&#xD;
dleton. He had once proffered his assistance. There&#xD;
was, therefore, no impropriety in asking merely if he&#xD;
knew of any employment adapted to Walter, stating his&#xD;
eager desire; by his own efforts, to secure his support.&#xD;
The letter sent, Walter was more at ease. The first and&#xD;
most painful step had been taken-the communication to&#xD;
Mr. Grafton. In about a week letters were received, and&#xD;
among others the desired answer from Mr. Middleton.&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
55&#xD;
&#xD;
Walter watched his guardian's countenance while -he&#xD;
read. At first it expressed blank disappointment, then&#xD;
with a sudden burst of indignation he threw it toward&#xD;
Walter, exclaiming, "0 World! World! did I not do&#xD;
Well to quit you I"&#xD;
The letter, polite and cold, in substance was as fol-&#xD;
lows: Mr. Middleton was surprised at the application,&#xD;
which if he had ever, authorized, it must have been un-&#xD;
der an impulse that reflection would have checked; for&#xD;
how could he, a retired stranger in a foreign country, be&#xD;
supposed to have any practical knowledge available to&#xD;
Walter? He wished the lad. success; but, so far as he&#xD;
might venture to suggest, for one so young, without pat-&#xD;
ronage or fortune, his present obscurity was his safest&#xD;
condition. With good wishes for himself; etc., etc., it&#xD;
concluded.&#xD;
"Well," said Walter, calmly, "it is just as I once&#xD;
thought. Mr. Middleton is insane, and if not, then&#xD;
worse-much obliged by his advice, which ;we can do&#xD;
without. What next shall we turn to, sir ?"&#xD;
But Mr. Grafton's attention was riveted on a letter he&#xD;
had just opened, and which, though he looked at it, he&#xD;
did not appear to read. Presently he ran it hastily over,&#xD;
and, as if relieved, said, "Ii beg your pardon,' Walter.&#xD;
The sight of a handwriting I had not seen for many&#xD;
years startled me; I feared II could not say what; but,&#xD;
like many terrors' with which we torment ourselves,&#xD;
mine was unfounded. Among other matter~ the letter&#xD;
contains somewhat that has a bearing on our, present&#xD;
perplexities. The gentleman's name is Meredith; his&#xD;
residence is in New York, where you prefer to go: hear&#xD;
what he-says."&#xD;
After a reference to early friendship and long se~para..&#xD;

56           WALTER' THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
"I almost question my right to give you any trouble,&#xD;
and yet, if you are what you once were~ you&#xD;
no~ refuse to oblige a friend. I have an only child, a&#xD;
daughter. She has had, thus far, what is called the&#xD;
best instruction, but it is superficial and of little value;&#xD;
something more is necessary to satisfy me. But young&#xD;
people now-a-days think that they, too, constitute a re-&#xD;
public, and are quite capable of self-government; and&#xD;
for this reason I will not send my daughter to a board-&#xD;
ing-school, where she will learn little but insubordina-&#xD;
#~ion. The only alternative is a 'select' one, as they are&#xD;
called, or private lessons. I have tried both, and like&#xD;
neither. But if I could find a competent tutor,~ who&#xD;
should reside in my family, I believe that, with his in-&#xD;
~ctio~t and tay rv6ic~n, my object can be secured.&#xD;
I wish her to have a solid education-Latin and mathe-&#xD;
matics as the foundation, and on This a superstructure of&#xD;
history, philosophy, and whatever else we may agree&#xD;
upon. If you happen to know of a person qualified for&#xD;
this 'charge, and at the same 1;ime unexceptionable, please&#xD;
inform me; his salary shall be so liberal as to satisfy'&#xD;
him"&#xD;
"I will take the place, sir," said Walter; "that is, if&#xD;
you can recommend me."&#xD;
"Consider, Walter. It may be very irksome; it may&#xD;
even be offensive; it often is so; for parents, with an&#xD;
absurd inconsistency, will trust the minds and hearts of~&#xD;
children to persons whom they will, nevertheless, treat&#xD;
as inferiors. Iii. this case, however, such injustice may&#xD;
be ~pr~vented. You should go as my ward; you will&#xD;
then be put on the footing to which you are entitled."&#xD;
"Pardon me, sir-in that way I decline to go. It&#xD;
would be improper ~s it regards the parents, and fatal to&#xD;
my duty as a teacher. As your friend and ward, Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
and Mrs. Meredith would not feel at liberty to make de-&#xD;
mands or to f~nd deficiencies; and, on my part, courtesy&#xD;
to your friends would restrict the uncompromising fidel-&#xD;
ity due to my pupil. Forgive me if I presume to differ&#xD;
from you; but I fear lest your tenderness for me should&#xD;
mislead you. Send rae with such credentials as to char-&#xD;
acter and competency as you think 'I deserve, but noth-&#xD;
ing more. For the rest, I prefer to depend on myself.&#xD;
If they fail in common delicacy or humanity, I leave&#xD;
them,. but I will claim nothing as your protege."&#xD;
Mr. Grafton reflected. He did not partake of Walter's&#xD;
proud indifference in regard to the mysterious person&#xD;
who had, or assumed to have, a supreme right over him.&#xD;
He did not, indeed, expect good from him, but he was&#xD;
not equally sure that. he had mA the power to injure.&#xD;
Walter's plan had one recommendation..,..4t would pre-&#xD;
vent embarrassing questions, and tend to the incognito&#xD;
he wished him to preserve. 'He. therefore acceded to it.&#xD;
"flut how, my dear boy, am I to live without you ?"&#xD;
sadly exclaimed Mr. Graftoxi when other considerations&#xD;
had been weighed.&#xD;
"Say, rather, how am I to live without you, sir?&#xD;
But no, I shall not be without you. Your affection, your&#xD;
advice, and you.r 'wishes will be ever with me to com-&#xD;
fort and guide me."&#xD;
An answer was immediately returned to Mr. Mere-&#xD;
dith, and after a short time came an acceptance of the&#xD;
tutor' but so qualified as a good deal to nettle Mr. Graf-&#xD;
ton. "If he did not prove, on trial, to be satisfactory,&#xD;
he would be returned, all expenses paid."&#xD;
"I will not send you like a bale of merchandise," said&#xD;
Mr. Grafton.&#xD;
Walter laughed. "Do not take it so, my dear sir;&#xD;
this is just what I should have 'wished. It is exactly&#xD;
fitted to my humor."&#xD;

Walter's preparations were now to be made, and in a&#xD;
state of astonishment and alarm Damie appeared. Years&#xD;
h~d increased her attachment to Mr. Grafton and his&#xD;
ward, but they had also invested her with *privileges&#xD;
sometimes inconvenient. Like Corporal Trim, she&#xD;
"loved to. advise," and an occasion now offered, itself.&#xD;
"Is Walter going away ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Damie."&#xD;
"But where under the canopy can he be so well off&#xD;
as here, sir?"&#xD;
"Young birds must leave the nest, Damie."&#xD;
"Yes, and hawks must catch 'em, too: what is he goin'&#xD;
fot, sir?"&#xD;
"To seek his fortune," said Mr. Grafton, with a shrug&#xD;
intended to check farther inquiry. "He naturally de-&#xD;
sires to earn his own snpport."&#xD;
"'Am his own support!"' repeated Damie, her reluc-&#xD;
tance to part with Walter inducing her to disparage his&#xD;
ability-" 'am his support I' why, what in all natur'&#xD;
can he do? He's never done nothing' but jest study and&#xD;
lam. He might be a minister, be sure-he knows&#xD;
enough; 'but he hasn't no call for that. What, then, can&#xD;
he do?"~&#xD;
"The' hext thing to preaching, Damie: he is going to&#xD;
teach."&#xD;
"To teach? and where, sir? and 'who?"&#xD;
"A gentleman'sdaughterinNewYork."9&#xD;
"Goin' to teach one gal 1" replied she, contemptuous-&#xD;
ly. "Well, if that isn't a poor business! Teaching&#xD;
thirty or forty might be worth a man's while. Why&#xD;
not take the district-school here?"&#xD;
"But suppose, Damie, that he should receive mor&amp;amp; for&#xD;
one scholar there than he would for the whole school&#xD;
here-"&#xD;
"More! why, is she so hard to lam? She isn't un-&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.&#xD;
der-witted, sir, is she?" continued I)amie, with a jeering&#xD;
smile; "if she be, 'tis, be sure, a pretty hard place."&#xD;
"No; bright and quick enough, I'll engage."&#xD;
"And what will he get, sir?"&#xD;
"They will settle that when they meet."&#xD;
"If I was you, sir, I wouldn't let him stir a step till&#xD;
I knew. 'Tis no way to send the poor lad off 'mong&#xD;
strangers, and let them impose on him."&#xD;
"Never fear, Damie. Walter. is not a person to be&#xD;
imposed on. You and I shall miss him greatly, but if&#xD;
for his advantage, we must bear it, you know."&#xD;
But not heeding this reflection, she proceeded:&#xD;
"Ever since, in this very room, he showed mc his&#xD;
poor scratched little hand, Pxre set by him. Boy~, £&#xD;
know, are hateful, always turning' up Jack. I never&#xD;
could bear any on 'em but Walter."&#xD;
"But Walter has not been perfect, Damie."&#xD;
"Parfect! no, be sure; who is? But when once in&#xD;
a while he was unruly he would be so sorry afterward,&#xD;
and wanted so to make it up; I only loved him better&#xD;
for't. Besides, it was jest because he was growing' so fast."&#xD;
"Well, well, don't grieve, my good Damie ;~ he will&#xD;
return to us all the happier and wiser for experience."&#xD;
"But when, sir? People go, but they don't always&#xD;
come back !" and her 'voice grew thick. "I've heard&#xD;
that afore; we may be all dead and buried when he&#xD;
comes__"&#xD;
hirnagair9 not so bad; a few months and we shall see&#xD;
Silenced, if not resigned, Damie retired; hut it was&#xD;
to pour out to Walter what she might not say to Mr.&#xD;

make, and in all respects arrange, while he occasionally&#xD;
offered a suggestion, she resumed her theme; lamented&#xD;
and advised, concluding with, "And what in all natur'&#xD;

reversed the proposition.&#xD;
"Yes, yes. Savin' on him! be sure you have. I&#xD;
mind what he was afore you come ; nothing' but teachin'&#xD;
you and playing' with you put any life in him; and now,&#xD;
when he hasn't got no special trouble, he looks younger&#xD;
than when you come. He looked so poor then, you&#xD;
haven't no notion, Walter. Folks said he was only sick.&#xD;
ly; wasn'tt no such thing, except it was heart-sickness.&#xD;
I've watched him many a time set and look in the fire&#xD;
as IC he was clean out of the body, and then start up,&#xD;
take his hat, and walk out. By-and-by he'd come in,&#xD;
looking' maybe a little better, but so sorrowful and. down&#xD;
like. But no matter what the trouble was, he never&#xD;
wasn't cr6ss nor pretty. He seemed to want to make&#xD;
others happy, even if he couldn't be so. Well, I guess&#xD;
I know.' I larut the signs," said she, shaking her head;&#xD;
"'tWas a hard lesson, but I haven't never forgot it."&#xD;
"What do you mean, Pamie? This is all new to&#xD;
"Yes; I suppose so; for now when he has any such&#xD;
turn come over him, and once in 'a while it will come,&#xD;
we call it nervous, you know. That's as good a'name&#xD;
as any; but, Lord! what different things it' means!&#xD;
Now the plain truth, Walter, is that, sure as I stand&#xD;
here, your uncle was disappointed, crossed in love as&#xD;
folks say. I can tell; I haven't had experience for&#xD;
nothing. "&#xD;
"Experience, Darnie 1"&#xD;
"Yes, Walter; for all what I seem to you. now, I&#xD;
wasn't so always. I had-I had.-'a friend-"&#xD;
'Damie stopped, and Walter, touched' by the workings&#xD;
of her strong expressive face, looked at her in silence.&#xD;
&#xD;
A P~EI~ AT THE PAST.           61&#xD;
Then, as if ashamed of a weakness, she proceeded, with&#xD;
an effort: "Lost at sea; news came the very day we'd&#xD;
flx'd for our publishment." After another pause, "New.&#xD;
er love to speak on't. A4lreadful storm! that's why I&#xD;
fly round so when the wind blows. I can do three days'&#xD;
work in one when it storms. They brought me home&#xD;
his watch; 'twas hanging' in his berth when he was&#xD;
knocked overboard, and there 'tis now at the head of&#xD;
my bed, keeping' time for me till he and I meet in etar-&#xD;
nity."&#xD;
Walter, in happy ignorance of similar emotions, knew&#xD;
not how to address her. He only took her hand and&#xD;
pressed it kindly; and, after a moment's hesitation, said,&#xD;
"Yes, Damie, though parted here, we shall find those&#xD;
we love in Heaven. Perhaps you are right about my&#xD;
uncle; I can not tell; but whatever trouble he may&#xD;
have had, it has only made him a better man. Some&#xD;
persons it makes worse, you know."&#xD;
"So it does, Walter. It makes their hearts harder&#xD;
than Pharaoh's. But don't let's say no more about it.&#xD;
These here shirts, Walter, aren't no dependence. You&#xD;
had ought to have told me in time, and I would have&#xD;
made you a new set; but never mind, I'll go right at&#xD;
em as soon as you are gone, and send 'em to you. Let&#xD;
me see; this is your best coatnot much the worse for&#xD;
wear. I'll put new cuffs, and then it'll do."&#xD;
Walter smiled. "City folks, I hear, are critical, Da-&#xD;
mie. I shall want a new coat."&#xD;
"Well, you wouldn't, if' you staid here, in six months.&#xD;
So it goes. What's the use arnin' money if you must&#xD;
spend it all? jest as good stay here and not want it.&#xD;
Now let me see-stockin's? Yes, all right; but no-&#xD;
body'll darn 'em for you now. Be sure you keep count&#xD;
of all your things, for they say that down in York&#xD;

more I want to say to you, WaJter. It has been on my&#xD;
mind for many a day, but while you was here there&#xD;
wasn'tiao use speaking' of it. You know I am not ex-&#xD;
pensive,' and, as I haven't any near relation, I've saved&#xD;
up mostly all my wages, and Mr. G-rafton has., put 'em&#xD;
out for me. Now this I mean for you-don't go for to&#xD;
interrupt me. Ye or you. I haven't nobody else to&#xD;
give it to. But, mind Walter, it is only in case you be-&#xD;
have. My honest arnin's shan't never go to be spent in&#xD;
any wickedness or folly. I meant to keep it all a gath-&#xD;
erin' till I died, and so leave you a good lump at once;&#xD;
but what's the use? So, if you want some on't now,&#xD;
here's twenty silver dollars in my chest for yon to take&#xD;
with you; and if any misfortin befalls you, let me know,&#xD;
and I will send you '~vhat you want."&#xD;
No kindness had ever touched Walter more; but,&#xD;
with the heartiest expression of his feeling, he neverthe-&#xD;
less resolutely declined the good creature's offer, who&#xD;
could only be reconciled to hi~ refusal by a promise that&#xD;
if the money were required he would certainly send&#xD;

ChAPTER VII.&#xD;
4&#xD;
THE day for Walter's departure came, and with a&#xD;
manly front, but a throbbing heart, he bade farewell to&#xD;
his friends. As he turned for a last look at the dear&#xD;
old weather-beaten house, with its Puritan roof descend-&#xD;
ing to the very tops of the windows, that seemed to look&#xD;
out from the projecting eaves like eyes from under over-&#xD;
hanging brows, he cast many tender thoughts to this&#xD;
shelter of his helpless years, and devoutly asked that&#xD;
peace might rest upon it till he should see it again.&#xD;
According to her custom, l3amie sought her consola-&#xD;
tion in work;* and after adjusting Walter's deserted room,&#xD;
religiQusly preserving every article he had left, and lock-&#xD;
ing the door,~ she was "flying round," as she termed it,&#xD;
in search~ of other safety-valves for her excited sensibil-&#xD;
ity, when a well-known voice met her ear, and a man&#xD;
entered the kitchen, singing,&#xD;

"Why, Jed," she exclaimed, "is that you? Where&#xD;

'Hios,'" a name by which she and others not better in-&#xD;

Before he answers he must be more particularly in-&#xD;
troduced than he has yet been. He now reappeared&#xD;
after a tramp in his commercial capacity, with his pack&#xD;
on his back, instead of a gun, or a pole suspending a&#xD;
string of fish. Having been "on the circuit," as he dig-&#xD;

en~e~were reserved for the 4th of July and other extra&#xD;
occasions, among which was included "goin' to meeting, "&#xD;
which he did when birds were not in season and when&#xD;
fish wouldn't bite. In person, short and thick, with a&#xD;
slight limp in his gait, a full ruddy face, a pleasant smile,&#xD;
quick gray eyes-in one, a cast, which gave to his coun-&#xD;
tenance a comical and roguish expression; hair slightly&#xD;
turned and thinned, more by hardship than years: such&#xD;
was Jed's outward man.&#xD;
"Not see me again! Why, Damie, my dear, I'm the&#xD;
sort that always comes back. Them that's no use to&#xD;
nobody"-~--with a self-satisfied air.-",is always sartin to&#xD;
come back."&#xD;
"Now, J.ed, don't go for to be modest, or I shall be&#xD;
rally uneasy about you."&#xD;
"Well, then, Pamie, you sha'n't have no consarn a~bo1it&#xD;
me on that account. When did I come? Why this&#xD;
very minute, and of course ii couldn't pass your door."&#xD;
"And you haven't had no breakfast, I know; so sit&#xD;
down and you shall have a hot rasher,"&#xD;
While she prepared it and bustled." round," he disen-&#xD;
cumbered himself of his pack; and. stretched his legs on&#xD;
the settle, giving forth, according to his custom, scraps&#xD;
of old songs. At length, seating him at the table, Da-&#xD;
mie rested'for a few mom~ts from her labors; but such&#xD;
a gloom gathered over her face, that Jed remarked it,&#xD;
and, resting his knik and fork, exclaimed, "What ails&#xD;
you,. Damie? Any thing happened?"&#xD;
"No, I'm well enough, only tired some, getting up so&#xD;
early to help, Walter off."&#xD;
"Walter off 1" repeated Jed, with a look of consterna'-&#xD;
tion. "Where? What for ?"&#xD;
Damie gave the required information.&#xD;

"Well, if J a'n't sorry! Gone to York! What shall&#xD;
I do without him ?"&#xD;
"You I" said Damie, her feeling of personal loss ag-&#xD;
gravated by any one presuming to share it. "What&#xD;
shall Ido?"&#xD;
"Why, Pamie, I've known him off and on 'most as&#xD;
long as you have, and a pleasanter lad, boy, and man, I&#xD;
never see. And didn't I teach him to use a gun, when&#xD;
you went into fits about the powder? No more danger&#xD;
in't than in so much black pepper, if folks is only car'-&#xD;
ful; and didn't I teach him to bait his hooky and show&#xD;
him the best places? And didn't he come every day to&#xD;
see me when I got the fever? And~ when people told&#xD;
him 'twas catching , in particular for young folks, didn't&#xD;
he say, like a brave boy, he couldn't die but once, and&#xD;
he better do so then, than to desert a friend in distress?&#xD;
And didn't he bring me nice things that ~rou made for&#xD;
me, and read the papers for me? No, don't tell me!&#xD;
I shall miss. him, and I will miss him !"&#xD;
This eulogy of her favorite, with the allusion to her&#xD;
own kindness, silenced and softened Damie.&#xD;
"Why didn't he go into the army," continued Jed,&#xD;
"if he must go away? That's the place for him. They&#xD;
say we're agoin' to have a brush with the French, and&#xD;
he'd be a major gin'ral in no time."&#xD;
"Army! Don't speak of it. Kuhn' and slaughterin'&#xD;
folks! He's fit for something' better, I guess."&#xD;
"Come, come, Damie! no more of that. Don't go for&#xD;
to abuse the army. I wonder where you'd all be now&#xD;
if 'twa'n't for the 'old Continentals' and the rest. And&#xD;

"A very pretty young woman at one of the quality&#xD;

produced the money. As she handed it to him, she&#xD;

"Perhaps that is only her mode of expressing her re-&#xD;

There was one way by which Mr. Grafton aggravated&#xD;
D ie: seeking to excuse th6se she considered un-&#xD;

did no comprehend&#xD;
"That 'where ye doubt, the truth not knowing,&#xD;
Believing the best, good may be growing.&#xD;
In judging the best, no harm at the least,&#xD;
In judging the worst, no good at the best."&#xD;
"No, sir; 'tis nothing' but downright pride. She is&#xD;
willing enough to beg, not a bit afraid of being burden-&#xD;
some. She pretends to buy just to save her pride. She&#xD;
has always some way of fixin' it; sometimes she's goin' to&#xD;
bring mops, but they never come; or, if they do, IF have&#xD;
to give t7v~ro prices for 'em. To-day, 'twas, 'If the Lord&#xD;

She wonderedd if the squire hadn't a bedstead he'd sell&#xD;

"Now," said IDamie, "that means he'll go and do the&#xD;

CHAPTER 1Q11.&#xD;
AT the period referred to, traveling was attended by&#xD;
difficulties little understood by the present generation,&#xD;
for whom time and space are nearly annihilated. Postal&#xD;
communications were pretty generally established, but&#xD;
few stage..coach routes existed, and mails were trans..&#xD;
ported in such modes as were convenient. As his read-&#xD;
iest way, Walter, after a drive of some five-and-twenty&#xD;
miles of bad road, consuming the greater part of the day,&#xD;
took the coach from Albany to New York, well pleased&#xD;
to be em route for the Great Metropolis~.even then in the&#xD;
ascendant she has ever since maintained. At the con-&#xD;
clusion of the fourth day he was dropped, with his bag..&#xD;
gage, on the stone steps of a handsome house at the&#xD;
lower part of Broadway, near the Bowling Green.&#xD;
In the interval since the city had been relieved from&#xD;
British ocdupation.~some Afteen years-~-.it had risen lit-&#xD;
erally' like a phoenix. The great fire which, while they&#xD;
held Possession, had consumed nearly a fourth'part of it,&#xD;
had made room for better buildings than those it had&#xD;
displaced. "Canvas Town," on the present Whitehall&#xD;
Street, so called from the tents which for a time supplied&#xD;
the place of the ht~bitations destroyed by the flre-.-the&#xD;
wretched shelter of a more wretched population~had in&#xD;
its turn, disappeared, 'and was succeeded by good and&#xD;
handsome hou~es. The lower part of Broadway was&#xD;
now the especial sphere 'of fashion. Sidewalks and&#xD;
lamps had been given to it, and the unsightly gutter in&#xD;
its centre no longer existed. The gardens, too, of the&#xD;
patrician families, many of whom had f~j CC&#xD;
the Broadway, though their residences were at&#xD;

&#xD;
the western end of Stone Street, then an aristocratic&#xD;
quarter, were now covered by fine houses. The fort&#xD;
and 'its sentinels, once the representatives of royalty, and&#xD;
holding in awe the* subject city, had surrendered to a&#xD;
republican government-house without guards; and the&#xD;
Bowling Green in front of it was relieved of the king's&#xD;
statue. On the site of old Trinity Church, destroyed by&#xD;
the' fire, a second had been erected, to yield in time to&#xD;
~the present one, far exceeding its predecessors in size&#xD;
and beauty.&#xD;
Broadway, thus renovated, reposed in elegant exemp-&#xD;
tion from all vulgar occupation. Private equipages&#xD;
moved along its clean and airy length unjostled by om-&#xD;
nibuses. Shops had not yet invaded it, except at what&#xD;
was then its upper end; and the few carts that appeared,&#xD;
seemed rather permitted than, as now, the rightful p05-&#xD;
sessors. The side-walks, clean and unobstructed, were&#xD;
the favorite promenade of well-dressed ladies, who now&#xD;
adventure there at the peril not only of silks and vel-&#xD;
vets, but of life and limb.&#xD;
Not alone in Broadway, but throughout the city, the&#xD;
change was apparent: in the new nomenclature of the&#xD;
streets, the absence of sentries at great men's doors, the&#xD;
increased activity, the evidences of wealth, and a grow-&#xD;
ing conlinerce. M~nner5, too, were in a transition state.&#xD;
Coffee4iouse Bridge, at the foot of Wall Street, where,&#xD;
before the war, gentlemen "used most to congregate,"&#xD;
was no more. Th~ Saturday-night club at Brook's Tav-&#xD;
ern, with tea, politics, and oysters, had given place to&#xD;
Qther, and perhaps less justifiable relaxations; and wa-&#xD;
ter~sockies-~'-~a small black~fish-Were no longer sought&#xD;
by lawyers, who used to meet in summer, a little out of&#xD;
town, for the purpose of thus regaling themselves.&#xD;
The evening had closed on the city, and Walt6r could&#xD;
only form an imperfect idea of the objects immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
surrounding him, and of that which naturally chiefly&#xD;
struck him-its vastness.&#xD;
His ring at the door was answered by a grave-looking&#xD;
colored serving-man, who, on being told his name, asked&#xD;
him to walk in.&#xD;
"I am expected, then," thought he: "so much the&#xD;
better; II am not come too soon."&#xD;
lie was ushered into a room~which he soon compre-&#xD;
hended to be the library~furni5~~J with heavy mahog-&#xD;
any chairs, high, straight~backqd and black with age;&#xD;
seats covered with crimson moreen, and window-curtains&#xD;
of the same material, raised, by cords and pulleys instead&#xD;
of being drawn aside. Bookcases of the same dark&#xD;
wood, with glass doors, filled the recesses of the room,&#xD;
and a Turkey carpet covered the floor. On the centre&#xD;
of the mantle-piece was a richly-cased clock, of old-fash-&#xD;
ioned form, bearing on its silvered dial the name of "Pea-&#xD;
cock, iRoyal Exchange, London," and no glass or china&#xD;
was allowed to glitter near it. Good maps were hung&#xD;
wherever space admitted of them, but no "obfrt d'art"&#xD;
relieved the grave aspect of the room, evidently furnish-&#xD;
ed according to the taste of one opposed to innovation.&#xD;
By a round table, very dark, and whose polished sur-&#xD;
face reflected the lights from two candles in tall, mass-&#xD;
ive silver candlesticks, in a 'library-chair.t~~ only&#xD;
thing in the room in which ease appeared to have been&#xD;
consulted.~was seated a middle-aged gentleman, lie&#xD;
was reading but he laid down his book and turned&#xD;
his eyes to the door as Walter entered, who, to cut&#xD;
short all uncertainty advanced, and presented Mr. Graf-&#xD;
ton's letter, the superscription of which announced the&#xD;
b&#xD;
earer.&#xD;
"Ala I" sa'd Mr.1\4Ldj&#xD;

'~" You left ~4i~{Grafton well, I hope."&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Yourjourney has not been very fatiguing, I suppose.&#xD;
Hardy habits make one indifferent to such things."&#xD;
Walter bowed. Three days and two nights in the&#xD;
mail-coach, over very bad roads, was not pleasant, but&#xD;
not to be spoken of.&#xD;
A silence ensued, which neither seemed to care to&#xD;
break. Presently the clock struck the hour of tea, and&#xD;
Mr. Meredith rang the bell.&#xD;
A tea-tray was brought in, rich with highly.wrought&#xD;
silver; another, on which were the only edibles-bread&#xD;
and butter, in slices incredibly thin, on a china plate,&#xD;
and, on another, hard waffles-well termed wafers.&#xD;
These constituted the substantial of the meal, which, to&#xD;
our hungry young traveler, promised rather to provoke&#xD;
than to satisfy his appetite. Then came&#xD;
"The bubbling and loud-hissing urn,&#xD;
Throwing up a steamy column ;"&#xD;
and Mrs. Meredith entered-a lady somewhat past her&#xD;
prime, but still comely, with "gracious womanhood and&#xD;
gravitie," well harmoniZing with her puce.colored silk&#xD;
dress. Her handkerchief; of the finest I~ndia muslin,&#xD;
was disposed over her bosom in what was called "a&#xD;
craw"-a style that obtained for the wearers the sobri-&#xD;
quet of the "Brest (c'est ~ dire breast) Squadron"-from&#xD;
the voluminous expanse of which peeped a "modesty-&#xD;
piece." She wore a cap, in the fashion called "French&#xD;
night-cap," with a high crown, full lace border descend-&#xD;
ing low at the ears, and a large white satin bow in front;&#xD;
a thin muslin apron, ornamented with tambour-work,&#xD;
and black lace mitts nearly meeting the sleeve, which&#xD;
terminated at the elbow.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mrs. Meredith," said. her husband, "here is Mr.&#xD;
Thornley, whom Mr. Grafton has sent to us."&#xD;
Walter bowed, in deference to the lady, not to the&#xD;
manner of his introduction. She courtesied slightly,&#xD;
said in a gentle tone she was happy to see Mr. Thorn-&#xD;
ley, and passed to the ministration of the tea-table.&#xD;
Just in the shadow of Mrs. Meredith, like a little satek&#xD;
ite in attendance on its primary, was a young girl,&#xD;
"As faire as faire mote ever bee,"&#xD;
"And in the flower now of her freshest age,"&#xD;
for this was her fifteenth spring. Had a passpo7rt been&#xD;
made out for her, it might have run somewhat in this&#xD;
wise: Face oval; complexion fair~ and so clear that&#xD;
with every emotion that stirred the young blood, it man-&#xD;
tled in her cheek to the richest bloom. Eyes full, and&#xD;

Her soft, wavy brown hair was turned back from the&#xD;

simple and appropr~~te than that of an infant in these&#xD;
days, was a fine Holland (linen) frock, with a tight and&#xD;
rather a long waist, buttoned up at the back. The skirt,&#xD;
full and plaited, was open~ behind. The sleeves, short&#xD;
and looped up, showed an under one of linen cambric,&#xD;
turned up with a lace-edged cuff; the same trimming at&#xD;
the neck, which was uncovered. A moderately stiff&#xD;
~stays confined the waist; for, though the steel busk and&#xD;
5tiff circular front were tiow generally discarded, Mrs.&#xD;

increasing an4 alarming relaxation in manners, still ad-&#xD;
hered to the stays with certain mitigation; and the fine-&#xD;
l~ developed bust and erect person of her daughter&#xD;
showed that she had received no injury from it. A.&#xD;
broad sash, with long streamers behind, differing little&#xD;
but in name from the rejected "leading.stringS ;" green&#xD;
morocco shoes, covering little feet, in nice proportion&#xD;
with a very pretty pair of hands, completed the young&#xD;
lady's attire.&#xD;
"This, Mr. Thoruley," said Mr. Meredith, "is my&#xD;
daughter, Miss Eleanor Meredith."&#xD;
The young lady courtesies; alter returned a bow&#xD;
as cold and distant as if prescribe b r father. Had&#xD;
they met in Ashton under the same circumstances, he&#xD;
would have involuntarily extended his hand in token&#xD;
of the friendly relations he. hoped to establish between&#xD;
himself; and his pupil; but he readily understood that&#xD;
here i~ wonid be regarded as a Iliherty, and he was per-&#xD;
fectly saXisfled to omit it.&#xD;
"If the face," thought he, "be an index to the brain,&#xD;
I shall not have much difficulty as a teacher."&#xD;
The tea was not enlivened by many words. When&#xD;
the tray was removed, Mrs. Meredith took up her shut-&#xD;
tle and busied herself with knotting, and Eleanor seated&#xD;
herself by he~ with her filigree-work. "What on earth&#xD;
those taper fingers were about! why those narrow gold-&#xD;
edged strips. 0f? paper of all colors were thus rolled up,&#xD;
and then: carefully disposed of," Walter could not divine,&#xD;
and? the l~notting too was equally a mystery, unaccus'&#xD;

ladies occupied themselves.&#xD;

simply tired, and soon requested permission to retire.&#xD;
He was accordingly lighted to the attic by the servant&#xD;
who had admitted him; and, having placed his candle&#xD;
on a table, he surveyed the room; then, looking from&#xD;
the window to the street, which seemed immeasurably&#xD;
beneath him, he thought, "Well, I am nearer the sky&#xD;
than I have ever been before, I believe, so I may be said&#xD;
to be rising in the world; but I am mortally, hungry.&#xD;
Oh! for a cold cut from Damie's buttery. I have not&#xD;

K.&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
IN the morning Walter was' shown into the dining-&#xD;
room, where he perceived more decoration. With the&#xD;
same generally substantial character was intermingled&#xD;
modern taste, showing that innovation had been less&#xD;
sternly resisted in the female department. The ma-&#xD;
hogany furniture was carved instead of plain. Chintz&#xD;
curtains of a graceful form had replaced worsted ones.&#xD;
The wails were hung pith a handsome French paper,&#xD;
and a large commodious sofa and stuffed arm-chairs gave&#xD;
an air of luxury to the room. On the mantle-piece was&#xD;
a French clock, where the flight of time was enlivened&#xD;
by cupids. But this concession to the present genera-&#xD;
tion was indemnified by the china shepherds and shep-&#xD;
herdesses, the admiration of the preceding, that support-&#xD;
ed it on either side; and these, again, were flanked by&#xD;
lustres of recent date. A large mirror, so placed as to&#xD;
reflect these adornments, was richly set in the fantastic&#xD;
taste of the Louis Quatorze period; but the thousand&#xD;
fanciful trifles that fill every inch of space in the present&#xD;
parlors and drawing-rooms then were not.'&#xD;
Walter found the family assembled. A few moments&#xD;
intervened before breakfast, during which Eleanor read,&#xD;
or appeared to read, and, having nothing else to dci, Wal-&#xD;
ter occupied himself in looking at her. She seemed to&#xD;
him even prettier than on the previous evening, in her&#xD;
chintz frock of many colors, her vandyke of fine cam-&#xD;
bric, and apron of the same; or it might be that, having&#xD;
volunteered a "good-morning, Mr. Thornley," as he en-&#xD;
tered, he was disposed to regard her more favorably.&#xD;
The breakfast over, and Mr. Meredith having read his&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.&#xD;
papers, he said, "II am going to my office now, Mr. Thorn-&#xD;
ley, and, as you may like to look a little about you be.~&#xD;
fore commencing your regular occupation, we will say&#xD;
nothing of it at present. If I am not otherwise engaged&#xD;
this afternoon, I purpose to have some preparatory talk&#xD;
with you in the library."&#xD;
Walter had only to assent, and deferring his explora-&#xD;
tion of the city, he retired to his room to write to Mr.&#xD;
Grafton.&#xD;
Two o'clock was the dinner-hour. When he entered&#xD;
the room he found the family already seated at table&#xD;
and, in addition, two guests. Mr. Meredith motioned to&#xD;
Walter to take a chair at his left hand, and said, "This&#xD;
is Mr. Thornicy, gentleme; of whom I spoke to you."&#xD;
Of the persons so addressed, one raised his eyes with&#xD;
a slight inclination of the head; the other, turning to-&#xD;
ward him a face from which a laugh had not quite&#xD;
passed, gave him a careless, good-natured nod, and pro-&#xD;
ceeded with his conversation. But, however little the&#xD;
notice bestowed on Walter, his own attention was at&#xD;
once engaged by the gentleman last mentioned. In age&#xD;
he seemed about thirty-five;, in stature, short and thick-&#xD;
set. The lower part of his face was mirthful, but there&#xD;
was power in his well-developed forehead, and quickness&#xD;
in his deep-set, vivacious gray eyes. An observer might&#xD;
have safely pronounced him as acute in argument as in&#xD;
jest irresistible~ while the negligent eufi~iiemern of' his&#xD;
air showed that business and ~care sat lightly on him.&#xD;
They were both lawyers, and the conversa~ionthough&#xD;
chiefly professional, was animated and agreeable. Dull&#xD;
points of law were enforced by a joke, and humorous&#xD;
anecdotes confirmed "grave precedents," in all of which&#xD;
the gentleman referred to excelled.&#xD;
The dinner was so bountiful that Walter comprehend.&#xD;
ed the Scanty city tea. At the proper time, one gentle-&#xD;

* 80           WALTER TIIORNJiEY  OR,&#xD;
man begged to take wine with Mr. Meredith, and the one&#xD;
'w~ho had so much attracted Walter asked the same favor&#xD;
of Miss Eleanor, seated next to him. Mr. Meredith with-&#xD;
out speaking filled Walter's glass, as he would have done&#xD;
that of a child or an inferior; but having done so turned&#xD;
away and continued to converse with his guests. Wal-&#xD;
ter left his wine untouched.&#xD;
~J~he gentleman, after talking with Eleanor, seemed&#xD;
disposed to some farther acquaintance with her.&#xD;
"And so, young lady, you are learning Latin, math-&#xD;
ematics, and of course the whole circle of sciences, eh ?"&#xD;
Eleanor blushing replied, " Only a little, sir.~,&#xD;
"Very well; the less the better. Let me give you a&#xD;
word of advice. I can spare it, for I get plenty of it."&#xD;
A laugh from the others seemed confirmatory.&#xD;
"Don't mind them; they are laughing, not at you, but&#xD;
at me. Now for my advice. Don't spoil those pretty&#xD;
eyes by hard study, for one of these days some very&#xD;
clever fellQw will rather have you conjugate for him in&#xD;
plain English the verb 'to love,' indicative mode, pres-&#xD;
ent tense; first person singular, than that you should&#xD;
speak all the dead languages. Besides-another thing&#xD;
-you like to dance ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir," said Eleanor, with a smile.&#xD;
"Aid I thought so; but you can never dance well&#xD;
in 'blue stockings'-nO lady ever 4id! Take care of&#xD;
the heels. The head-your head, certainly-will take&#xD;
care of itself."&#xD;
"Bad advice!" exclaimed Mrs. Meredith; "very bad&#xD;
advice, sir! You'll spoil my daughter."&#xD;
"My dear madam, don't you perceive that I am act-&#xD;
ing on the defensive? Young ladies will be treading&#xD;
on our heels if they neglect their own. In fifty years&#xD;
tti~y'll be contending for the right to vote, for seats on&#xD;
the bench, and professors' chairs, if they are allowed to&#xD;

A PEEP AT TILE PAST.           81&#xD;
go on. We must check them, or we men shall be ex~&#xD;
tinct-.among the lost races! Latin and mathematics!&#xD;
Why, my dear madam, 'tis a repetition of the 'original&#xD;
sin!' Knowledge to women! 'tis the forbidden fruit.&#xD;
No, no; samples and receipt-books forever!"&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith shook her head, but did not refuse a&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"I am sorry to say," continued the gentleman, "what&#xD;
must needs shock your conjugal reverence; but your&#xD;
*     husband is the most inconsistent man I know."&#xD;
"Inconsistent! I can not think it."&#xD;
"No, I dare say not; but I can prove it. No man&#xD;
more alarmed than he at the progress of democracy,&#xD;
and yet he puts the greatest leveler into the hands least&#xD;
able to use it discreetly-~.--knowledge to Women. Why,&#xD;
we shall beat the French. Instead of one goddess of&#xD;
reason, every town and village will be overrun with&#xD;
them."&#xD;
Eleanor listened, but not with an undivided attention.&#xD;
She was pi~zzling herself to discover what the gentleman&#xD;
could mean by dancing in "blue stockings !" and she&#xD;
cast a furtive glance at Walter as she "wondered if Mr.&#xD;
Thornley knew." But she had no time to speculate&#xD;
on his countenance, for he rose at the moment to leave&#xD;
the room, saying to Mr. Meredith, "I will attend you in&#xD;
the library, sir, when you please to send for me."&#xD;
"Very well," replied Mr. Meredith, but without sug-&#xD;
gesting that he should stay longer.&#xD;
Expecting a summons, Walter remained within, in-&#xD;
stead of taking the walk he had promised himself; but&#xD;
he received no call till the hour of tea, and then no ~ipol-&#xD;
ogy for the omission.&#xD;
The same formal meal succeeded, after which Mr.&#xD;
Meredith had an engagement, and Walter was left with&#xD;
Mrsr Meredith and her daughter.&#xD;

In a voice and. manner rendering commonplaces agree-&#xD;
able, the former asked him what he had seen of the city.&#xD;
~" Nothing, madam; I have not been out."&#xD;
"Indeed! Why not?"&#xD;
"In the morning I was occupied, and in the afternoon&#xD;
Mr. Meredith had said he should wish to speak to me."&#xD;
"Al! I am sorry. You have, then, had a dull day."&#xD;
Walter could not deny it.&#xD;
"II3tLt you have at least seen two of our principal law-&#xD;
yers, and I thought Mr. Hoffman impressed you agreea-&#xD;
bly."&#xD;
"I was not aware that I had seen him."&#xD;
"Seen him! You dined with him."&#xD;
"I did not know it, madam."&#xD;
"Why, you were introduced."&#xD;
Walter smiled.&#xD;
"41~~ name was mentioned, I believe; but I thought&#xD;
that an introduction, to be such, must be mutual."&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith, not knowing what to reply, turned the&#xD;
conversation; and, willing to be complimentary, said,&#xD;
"A country life, with its simple habits, has its advant-&#xD;
ages. II observed you drank no wine.~~&#xD;
Again Walter smiled.&#xD;
"1 am not, for that reason, entitled to be commended&#xD;
for simplicity. I like a glass of wine occasionally, but I&#xD;
never took a solitary one in my life; its chiqf pleasure&#xD;
to me is the companionship it expresses."&#xD;
A woman's tact seldom fails her. Mrs. Meredith's did&#xD;
not, and she resolved on a secret representation to her&#xD;
husband.&#xD;
Eleanor meanwhile was silent, but her eyes often turn-&#xD;
ed to Walter, and as often as he smiled she smiled too;&#xD;
but why? Perhaps she could not have told.&#xD;
It must not be inferred that Walter's notice of these&#xD;
omissions was in an exacting spirit. Mr. Grafton, both&#xD;
&#xD;
A. PEEP AT THE PAST.            83&#xD;
from temper and education an observer of the small&#xD;
charities that soften life, had c fully retained them in&#xD;
his little household, where alter was accustomed to&#xD;
see their visitors, however treated with atten-&#xD;
tion, and had thus been early instructed iii all the conrt.&#xD;
* esies practicable in their situation. But he did not over-&#xD;
rate them., Not so Mr. Meredith; and Walter already&#xD;
comprehended that when omitted by hi~n it was with a&#xD;
meaning, and that meaning he meant to resist.&#xD;
The next morning, after breakfast, Mr. Meredith re-&#xD;
quested to see him in the library, and thither they we;~t.&#xD;
The course of study for Eleanor having been marked&#xD;
out by her father, Walter, in the main, assented, only&#xD;
begging leave to differ in some small details. . Mr. Mer-&#xD;
edith was a strenuous advocate for the technical mode&#xD;
of instruction; Walter, though he would not object to a&#xD;
severe drilling for a youth destined to a profession, ven-&#xD;
tured to say that for a young lady he should prefer a&#xD;
some~bat different method. Taught by his own expe-&#xD;
rience under the instruction of Mr. Grafton, he dwelt&#xD;
much on the power of the teacher~ not merely to in-&#xD;
struct, but to enlarge the mind; not alone to excite the&#xD;
taste, but to refine it. That, omitting sometimes dry&#xD;
technicalities, lest he should disgust his pupil, he should&#xD;
endeavor to leave no beauty in sentiment or morals un-&#xD;
perceived, thus leading her through her lessons as a&#xD;
means to that which was higher.&#xD;
Mr. Meredith listened with attention, lie was not de-&#xD;
ficient in good feeling, but the changes of the time im-&#xD;
pended over him like a nightmare, lie conceived it the&#xD;
duty of every citizen to maintain the proper subjection&#xD;
of the young to the old, and the due subordination that&#xD;
keeps each class in it8 own place. Yet he was not un-&#xD;
willing to acknowledge merit, and to admit that an mdi-&#xD;
idual might lawfully emancipate himself from res~ic-&#xD;

tions, nevertheless wholesome in themselves. He began&#xD;
t~ regard Walter from a new point of view. Deceived&#xD;
by his youthful appearance, he had set him down as a&#xD;
half.taught country lad, who might possibly be made of&#xD;
some use u~ider his directions. He found him instruct-&#xD;
ed and mature beyond his years, with unembarrassed&#xD;
manner, modest and unpresuming in the expression of&#xD;
his ~views, yet maintaining them with dignity. He was&#xD;
so well pleased he became communicative. "He had&#xD;
been solicited," he said, "by some of his friends to ad-&#xD;
mit their daughters to share with Eleanor in his instruc-&#xD;
tion. But," continued he, "it would never do. I once&#xD;
did try the experiment, but such an ungovernable set&#xD;
you never saw I They nearly drove the poor man dis-&#xD;
tracted, although he was almost twice your age. You&#xD;
could never endure it."&#xD;
"Just as you please, sir. I should not fear to under-&#xD;
take it on my own account."&#xD;
"Why, what could you do with a dozen girls, who&#xD;
could not be flogged like so many boys? Whose pa-&#xD;
rents would expect them to be tr ted like young ladies,&#xD;
but who were, in fact, ill-bred romW."&#xD;
"If inaccessible to remo~stranc~and reproof; I would&#xD;
simply dismiss them sine die," saj4 Walter, laughing.&#xD;
"No, no, 'tis better as it is; and as I approve of your&#xD;
ideas as far as you have explained them, you will pro-&#xD;
ceed to carry them out as soon as you please. One thing&#xD;
only has first to be settled-f wish you to be satisfied in&#xD;
all respects-the terms&#xD;
"I beg yot~r pardon, sir," said Walter; "I understood&#xD;
there was to~be a period of trial. I prefer to wait till&#xD;
the expiration of that before my remuneration is fixed."&#xD;
"Trial! Oh ay, yes; but I am quite satisfied now. ~&#xD;
"I regarded the provision as applicable to both par-&#xD;
ties, sir.&#xD;
&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
"How? I don't understand you."&#xD;
"You are so good as to say that you are satisfied.&#xD;
Perhaps you are precipitate; but allow me to say, sir,&#xD;
that, if your mind is made up, it is possible that mine is&#xD;
not."&#xD;
Mr. Meredith looked disappointed and perplexed.&#xD;
"Permit me, sir," said Walter, "to be frank with you.&#xD;
The position is a new one to me. I can not exact treat-&#xD;
ment from you differing from that which you may deem&#xD;
proper. But, if our views in this respect do not agree,&#xD;
i[ must do as II have said that I should request the young&#xD;
ladies to do-take my dismissal. A month will proba-&#xD;
bly settle our respective relations. Until that shall have&#xD;
passed we will, if you please, sir, say nothing of terms."&#xD;
Mr. Meredith was beginning to understand him.&#xD;
"Your hand, Mr. Thornley !" said he, with a hearti-&#xD;
ness Walter did not think in his nature. "I respect&#xD;
your frankness and manliness as much as I do your at-&#xD;
tainments. It shall not be my fault if we disagree."&#xD;
The two previous evenings Walter had been allowed&#xD;
to retire at an. early hour, with no suggestion to the con-&#xD;
trary. This evening, however, when about doing so,&#xD;
M~. Meredith said, "Stay and take a little supper with&#xD;
us, Mr. Thornley. It is a very light one, and usually&#xD;
restricted to my family; but if you will partake of it, it&#xD;
will give me pleasure."&#xD;
Thus invited, Walter did not refuse. The time pass-&#xD;
ed cheerfully. Mr. Meredith unbent; and, condescend-&#xD;
ing to talk to Walter on general topics, he was surprised&#xD;
into an interest so unusual with him, that when sepa-&#xD;
rating for the night he requested that "whenever agree-&#xD;
able to himself he would favor them in flie sa~ne way."&#xD;
The next morning Walter was shown into the library,&#xD;
where, in a few moments, Miss Eleanor entered to re-&#xD;

mary examination, in order to decide the course to be&#xD;
pursued, lie found, as he had been given to expect,&#xD;
that her instruction had been but superficial, as was, in-&#xD;
deed, at the time, the fact with regard to female educa-&#xD;
tion generally. Geography and history without maps&#xD;
or dironology; grammar by rote; arithmetic to the&#xD;
"rule of three".-~exampleS set down in the books, and&#xD;
the answers obtained from the same-as Mrs. Malaprop&#xD;
would. say, "a supercilious knowledge of accounts;"&#xD;
reading conducted in a similar manner, each girl in the&#xD;
class taking the page or paragraph which fell to her&#xD;
share, without heeding that which preceded or followed.&#xD;
Any thing like hard study, with few exceptions, was&#xD;
L~nthought of. Girls were riot allowed, to use the lan-&#xD;
guage of the above quoted lady, to "meddle with Greek,&#xD;
or Hebrew, or Algebra, Qr Simony, or Fluxions, or Par-&#xD;
adoxes, or such inflammatory branches of learning."&#xD;
The case with Eleanor was rather better, inasmuch as&#xD;
her father had insisted on Latin; but her most thorough&#xD;
attainment was in French. Among the unfortunate&#xD;
emigres, excellent teachers were found; and, with her&#xD;
~aice ear and natural facility, she had made quite a re-&#xD;
spectable progress in it. To this might be added music,&#xD;
not, indeed,&#xD;
"The fine sleights of hand&#xD;
And uniinagin'd fingerings, shuffling off&#xD;
The hearer's soul thro' hurricanes of notes." ~&#xD;
As a science she had no claim to it. Of "harmony"&#xD;
she knew little; but in "melody," well called "the Poe-&#xD;
try of Music," her sweet rich voice, her musical instinct,&#xD;
her delicate touch, all natural adaptations, did more for&#xD;
her than her teacher. Drawing, including coloring, she&#xD;
had learned like others. This chiefly consisted of me-&#xD;
chanical rules by which ever-varying nature was pre-&#xD;
sumed to be expressed. The same forms for the clouds,&#xD;
&#xD;
87&#xD;
the same straight lines to indicate water, the same un-&#xD;
changing tints for the sky, the same touch to express&#xD;
every variety of tree. Flowers as unlike nattire as if&#xD;
some Egyptian hierophant had prescribed a sacred and&#xD;
inviolable form; while perspective was still nearly an&#xD;
occult science.&#xD;
Almost the only thing really well taught was danc-&#xD;
ing, and here the teacher, generally French, could hard-&#xD;
ly fail. Heads unencumbered with learning, spirits un-&#xD;
checked by study, health Unimpaired by late hours, hot&#xD;
rooms, and stimulants, were admirable assistants. And&#xD;
it must be conceded by the present generation that their&#xD;
grandmothers, without any of the ologiess,' excelled them&#xD;
in the adaptation of motion to music, in the true ex-&#xD;
pression of youthful enjoyment. As they moved through&#xD;
the sprightly "contra - danse" and changeful cotillion,&#xD;
groups would gather round them to admire their flying&#xD;
feet, their graceful evolutions, their steps conformed to&#xD;
every varying note, their kindling cheeks, their spark-&#xD;
ling eyes. There was no voluptuous waltz no rom in&#xD;
polka, no stamping mazurka, no "walking through the&#xD;
figure." Dancing was neither a rage nor a pretense; it&#xD;
was an earnest and natural pleasure, in which also young&#xD;
men, now too busy or too indolent to enter into it heart-&#xD;
ily, then partook without the fear of being regarded as&#xD;
idlers, or as dancing-masters, if they executed an "entre..&#xD;
chat" or "cut a pigeon-wing." But to return to Walter&#xD;
and Eleanor.&#xD;
Having prepared the way, and prescribed the first les..&#xD;
son, he released her, he with an impression in favor of&#xD;
her natural capacity and good temper, she with a senti-&#xD;
ment half fear, half liking~something she could not&#xD;
well define, but entirely different from what Mr. A. or&#xD;
Mr. B. had inspired.&#xD;

threatened to render it irksome, he may be~ left to main-&#xD;

The first of July came; and, though Mr. Meredith&#xD;
brought inviting accounts of the beauty of their coun-&#xD;
try residence, the family were content to remain in the&#xD;
city till after the national festival of the "Fourth."&#xD;
That anniversary was then celebrated not only with&#xD;
noisy demonstrations, but with a pleasure that pervaded&#xD;
every class. The riQh, the refined, the fashionable, and&#xD;
the self-indulgent d1~d not then turn their backs upon&#xD;
it, see king a retreat where their trembling nerves might&#xD;
be safe from its patriotic explosions, leading the honors&#xD;
of the day to be paid by vulgar, and often by ruffianly&#xD;
excess.&#xD;
On the occasion referred to the day was hailed with&#xD;
even more th~z ordinary inte~'est. The general indig-&#xD;
nation at foreign aggression held in check the angry&#xD;
feelings ofopposing parties. A more hearty nationality&#xD;
prevailed, and religious services and an appropriate ora-&#xD;
tion enforced its proper observance. As the accustomed&#xD;
~procession passed through Broadway, from every door&#xD;
and window it was greeted. Gentle and simple, young&#xD;
and old, followed with eager gaze and thrilling hearts&#xD;
the long lines that, with various insignia, civil, military,&#xD;
and municipal, proceeded through the street to martial&#xD;
~and patriotic airs. Demonstrations of respect were made&#xD;
before the residences of official persons; in answer to&#xD;
which gray heads bowed, and fair young faces smiled-&#xD;
hands were, kissed, and handkerchiefs waved. Pulses&#xD;
beat ciuick at the sight of the old Continental uniform!&#xD;

A PEEP AT THE PAST.&#xD;

which, not then a mere pageant, expressed a reality felt&#xD;
and understood; and the New York iRangers, with oth-&#xD;
ers of the new levies-.among them sons of the best Lam-&#xD;
ilies-showed that the spirit of their sires was not extinct.&#xD;
The rejoicing were prolonged into the decline of the&#xD;
day by a gay and very general assemblage on the Bat-&#xD;
then the favorite promenade. There Mr. Meredith,&#xD;
accompanied by Walter, conducted Mrs. Meredith )and&#xD;
Eleanor. The latter, attired for the occasion in a n~W&#xD;
chip gipsy, tied with blue ribbons, and a white dimity&#xD;
cardinal trimmed with fringe, tripped along so gayly as&#xD;
to receive a rebuke from her father. But her spirits&#xD;
were up. The crowd, the music, the general exhilara-&#xD;
tion were intoxicating; besides, she had recited a good&#xD;
lesson, and Mr. Thornley had commended her: a rare&#xD;
OCcurrence.&#xD;
Nature, amid all changes, ever the same, unaffected&#xD;
by the mutations of men, was just as beautiful, and not&#xD;
more so, than now. A gorgeous sunset was shedding&#xD;
its light over the city and bay, tinting every jutting&#xD;
headland and island, and casting across the waters a&#xD;
broad gleam like molten gold. As the greater glory&#xD;
departed, the lesser replaced it,&#xD;
"The heavens unfolding all their gates&#xD;
To let the stars out slowJy."&#xD;
But among all this natural beauty human interests&#xD;
prevailed. Fireworks presumed to scale the empyrean;&#xD;
and illuminations, in characters of flame, repeated the&#xD;
sentiment, originating in the exigencies of the time,&#xD;
"Millions for defense! not a cent for tribute 1"&#xD;
They met troops of well-dressed people and happy&#xD;
children; and many salutations were exchanged. Among&#xD;
others, a gentleman accosted them, Who, giving his hand&#xD;
to Mr. Meredith, raised his hat and remained uncovered&#xD;
While he courteously conversed with his wife. The op-&#xD;

90           WALTER T2EiORNI~I~Y; OR,&#xD;
portunity thus afforded was not lost. His finely-formed&#xD;
head, his massy brow, his eyes, not effective in color or&#xD;
si~, but brilliant in expression, his well-cut profile, the&#xD;
genial smile that graced a mouth the fit instrument of&#xD;
truth-strong and beautiful !-the whole countenance&#xD;
informed by thought, so impressed Walter that he failed&#xD;
to obse~va that "his bodily presence" was unimposing,&#xD;
small even to diminutiveness. He felt only his superi-&#xD;
ority~&#xD;
The gentleman bowed and passed, and Mr. Meredith&#xD;
said, with a proud, complacent smile, "That is General&#xD;
Hamilton; at this juncture no man more important to&#xD;
the Republic-his sword as convincing as his pen !"&#xD;
Alas! little did the speaker foresee the ne~ar extinction&#xD;
Qf the life he so estimated! a sacrifice to malignant ri-&#xD;
valry, and a mistaken sense of duty.&#xD;
In their progress, approaching. one of the gates, Wal-&#xD;
ter observed a phaeton and pair drawn up in the street&#xD;
without, in attendance on a gentleman, who delayed to&#xD;
enter that he might address some parting words to per-&#xD;
sons near him. He was one to fix attention. He held&#xD;
his hat, under his arm, as if such were his custom in&#xD;
walking. His head and face, thus seen to greater ad-&#xD;
vantage, were striking and handsome. An air of com-&#xD;
mand increased the effect of his tall stature, and his whole&#xD;
appearance indicated a consciousness of power, which,&#xD;
nevertheless, did not offend, because it was felt to be&#xD;
based on rtire endowments both of mind and body.&#xD;
Walter was about to ask his name, when he perceived,&#xD;
as the gentleman ascended his carriage, that he had lost&#xD;
a leg.&#xD;
"Ah 1" said he, "Mr. Morris? Is it not?"&#xD;
"Yes; our minister to Fvance. But," in a tone of&#xD;
surprise, "how should you kiaow him ?"&#xD;
\ "%~re~at names," replied Walter, "penetrate the dark-&#xD;

est places. The stars, you know, sir~ may be seen from&#xD;
the bottom of a well."&#xD;
Again and again they went the usual round till Mr.&#xD;
Meredith suggested that they should conclude the even.&#xD;
/ 4   ing at Contoit's. Directing. their steps, therefore, to that&#xD;
part of State Street parallel with one side of the Battery,&#xD;
they entered beneath an archway, on which was in-&#xD;
scribed "Columbia Gardens," where a parterre of grass&#xD;
and flowers, surrounded by small alcoves, presented it-&#xD;
self. It was lighted, and on a stage elevated above the&#xD;
general level was an orchestra, and musicians were pre-&#xD;
luding the evening performance.&#xD;
Mr. Meredith having selected an alcove, an attendant&#xD;
appeared with ices, and a programme of the music for the&#xD;
occasion. After a short interval of expectation, the en-&#xD;
tertainment commenced by "Hail Columbia!" then in&#xD;
the zenith of its favor. To this succeeded an "over-&#xD;
ture," followed by singers, male and female; and, among&#xD;
other patriotic songs, "America, Commerce, and Free-&#xD;
dom" was received with a burst of applause. At length,&#xD;
the chief attraction, the prima donna of the evening, the&#xD;
celebrated Mrs. Gldmixon, made her appearance. The&#xD;
power of her voice there was no denying, nor the skill&#xD;
with which it was managed; but such were the contor-&#xD;
tions of a face to which Nature had been singularly un-&#xD;
kind, that Walter turned away in a sort of horror, for&#xD;
which her songs; though the most admired of the day,&#xD;
including the favorite "Gipsy's song," were no compen-&#xD;
sation. ITh had not learned that "the nearer the singer&#xD;
can arrive at a gasp, a sob, or a scream, the more success-&#xD;
fully the voice is treated."&#xD;
When Mrs. Oldmi~on had been encored and applaud-&#xD;
ed till Walter was wearied, Eleanor asked him how he&#xD;
was please~j&#xD;
"I must not tell untruths to you of all persons," said&#xD;
&#xD;

he. "Well, then, I do not like such music at all. I&#xD;
d~re say because Ii am too ignorant to enjoy it. I had&#xD;
infinitely rather~ hear you sing."&#xD;
"Oh, Mr. Thornley!" exclaimed she, much pleased.&#xD;
But Walter, unconscious of having excited emotion by&#xD;
the expression of a simple fact, understood the excla-&#xD;
mation as a remonstrance against his bad taste, and re-&#xD;
flect~d, "Row strange, that a creature so inartificial her-&#xD;
self could enjoy any thing so perverted P'&#xD;
"I see you think me a barbarian," said he; "but I&#xD;
must, nevertheless, say, that a fine, full voice exaggerated&#xD;
to a shriek, all sweetness and expression tortured out of&#xD;
it, gives me only pain."&#xD;
Eleanor said nothing, but she did not think* him "a&#xD;
barbarian" by any means.&#xD;
The next day Walter was introduced to a home more&#xD;
congenial to his habits than his city residence had been.&#xD;
The "Oaks," the country house of Mr. Meredith, was&#xD;
well adapted to comfort; plain and substantial, simply&#xD;
furnished, pleasantly situated in that part of Bloemen-&#xD;
dal nearest the North IRiver, and surrounded by grounck&#xD;
under good cultivadon, Walter fancied that there was,&#xD;
too, an air of greater freedom, something like what he&#xD;
had been accustomed to breathe. People did not walk&#xD;
with ste as noiseless, and doors were not always closed&#xD;
without a jar. Instead of the heavy carved mahogany&#xD;
chairs, imposing such responsibilities on the occupant,&#xD;
were "cottage" chairs-as those csf4he late fashion were&#xD;
called-the feet of which, if they did not always stand&#xD;
on the ~aine plane, it did not appear so great a breach&#xD;
of propriety. A large hall occupied the centre of the&#xD;
house, into which opened dining-room, drawing-room,&#xD;
library, and a room denominated "the study," because&#xD;
fhere Eleanor had received the masters who had given&#xD;
her private lessons. This communicated by a glass door&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.              93&#xD;
at the south with a piazza running round three sides of&#xD;
the house, to which a long window on the western side&#xD;
also furnished access. From the piazza a descent of a&#xD;
few steps led into a garden,' the especial delight of Mr.&#xD;
Meredith rwho far in advance of his neighbors in hor-&#xD;
ticulture, imported many of his plants from England and&#xD;
Holland. Shrubberies, oi~i mental trees, and shaded&#xD;
walks well disposed, increased its apparent size' and a&#xD;
fine woody chiefly of oak, gave it, though so near the&#xD;
city, an air of privacy and repose.&#xD;
The study, thus agreeably situated7 was furnished with&#xD;
books, maps, globes, and whatever could justify its ap-&#xD;
pellation; and here Eleanor had collected what she re-&#xD;
garded as her peculiar property. Albeit no student it&#xD;
was her favorite room; for here were her canary birds,&#xD;
and her gold and silver fish; a little cabinet covered&#xD;
with tortoise-shell, a writing-desk of Japan workman.&#xD;
ship, and a 9hinese pagoda made of rice, but looking&#xD;
like exquisitely.carv~d ivory. Here, also, was a Wonder-&#xD;
ful nest of balls of the same material, the admiration of&#xD;
eyes not then accustomed to the innumerable bijoux&#xD;
since introduced. Here were, in short, all those articles&#xD;
of taste that then constituted the staple of Christmas and&#xD;
New Ye~ir gifis.&#xD;
Into this room, destined to be henceforth what its&#xD;
name imported, Walter was introduced; Eleanor gra-&#xD;
ciously inviting him to use it whenever he pleased, a per-&#xD;
mission which its aspect inclined him to profit by.. The&#xD;
next day lessons were resumed; the door communicate .&#xD;
ing with the hall always open, and Mrs. Meredith and&#xD;
her work-basket always near it. Having a conjugal&#xD;
respect for her husband's opinions, she was ready to&#xD;
enforce them, particularly when, as in the present in-&#xD;
stance, her own experience tended to confirm them.&#xD;

&#xD;
"wax-work and sheflwork by Madam Roger," and a.&#xD;
smattering of bad. French by Mdxnslle. Blanch Beault-&#xD;
the lights of her time-enabled her rightly to estimate the&#xD;
better instruction now offered to her daughter. Yet she&#xD;
had a grateful remembrance of Mr. Leslie, one of the few&#xD;
good teachers of her time-SO honest as to send home a&#xD;
pupil, because, as he said, "she had learned all he could&#xD;
teach ;" ~and so charitable that out of his small earnings&#xD;
he paid a master to instruct the children of the poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
THE month of probation had passed; all parties were&#xD;
satisfied; Walter's remuneration was settled in the most&#xD;
liberal manner, and things remained as they were. But&#xD;
he was still learning to fit himself to his position. It&#xD;
was plain that his standing iu the family was quite diP&#xD;
fervent from what it had been. Instead of a tolerated&#xD;
member, he was now regarded with a certain degree of&#xD;
complacency; and since their removal to the country&#xD;
his companionship had seemed even desirable. But still&#xD;
he felt that his place was "below the salt"~-a situation&#xD;
in which some persons would have secured the advan-&#xD;
tages by quietly submitting to its exactions. This did&#xD;
not suit his humor. With one of the best of tempers,&#xD;
and having a real happiness in obliging, he resolved not&#xD;
to be the easy, good-natured young man, always ready&#xD;
for a vacant place, to entertain a bore, to walk or drive,&#xD;
as a whim might dictate; or to execute commissions&#xD;
properly belonging to one just hovering between a de-&#xD;
pendent and a domestic. Perhaps he was proud; but&#xD;
pride, which in excess is a vice, may sometimes be a safe-&#xD;
guard. At any rate; he was consistent, and that, for its&#xD;
rarity, is commendable. If invited to remain after din.&#xD;
ner or tea, exercise, books, or writing was an excuse; if&#xD;
a drive was suggested, he quietly preferred a walk; if a&#xD;
visit were proposed, he was always happy at home; by&#xD;
his self-dependence thus securing his independence. In&#xD;
a little time it became a circumstance to secure Mr. Tho~n-&#xD;
ley's society; and, somehow, neither Mr. nor Mrs. Mere~&#xD;
dith would any more have thought of making demands&#xD;
on his time for their own convenience than on that of any&#xD;

WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
other young gentleman with whom they were on terms&#xD;
of ecj~tal familiarity. Thus much obtained, Walter glad-&#xD;
ly relaxed his self-imposed restrictions.&#xD;
Meanwhile he had not been unmindful of the small&#xD;
things which go toward making the whole man. Train-&#xD;
ed by Mr. Grafton. in an. observance of proprieties which&#xD;
he had never laid aside himself, Walter, as soon as as-&#xD;
sured of his ability to attain his own support, had sub-&#xD;
mittedliimself to the hands of those persons who under-&#xD;
take to improve God's workmanship by the out of their&#xD;
clothes and the trim of their hair.&#xD;
The fashions for gentlemen, like oth~r things, were&#xD;
revolutionized. Fine cloths had nearly banished vel-&#xD;
vets, cut and uncut. Waistcoats of silk shot with gold&#xD;
or heavy with embroidery, scarlet stockings worked with&#xD;
gold, point - lace :ruffles and creepers, diamond stock-&#xD;
bu~ldes, solitaire, bags, and gold snuff-boxes, and all the&#xD;
elaborate toilet of the preceding generation had disap'&#xD;
peered. Wigs were on the decline, and powder ~ras dis-&#xD;
carded except by elderly persons, who disdained to sub-&#xD;
mit their heads to the, sa'nsculotteism~ of a crop, and who&#xD;
retained it, together with their cambric chitterlings and&#xD;
ruffles, to testify that gentlemen were still extant.&#xD;
As~bject of much more anxiety to Walter than his&#xD;
own standing was his pupil. If dissatisfied, he could&#xD;
go; that was a matter soon settled. But he could not&#xD;
so easily dispose of the question, "Was he of any use to&#xD;
her, or was he likely to be so&#xD;
With good natural powers, a sweet, ingenuous, play-&#xD;
ful temper, quick sensibility, and a confiding heart, she&#xD;
had no taste for study, no value for knowledge. This,&#xD;
he was aware, was greatly the fault of the parrotry in.&#xD;
which she h~d been allowed to proceed; but might he&#xD;
hope to ~ffect the change that was necessary? Thus far&#xD;
he could not flatter himself that he had secured any&#xD;

&#xD;
thing but obedience and personal good-will. He would,&#xD;
indeed, most unwillingly have left a creature of such fine&#xD;
impulses to instruction which, however imperfect his&#xD;
own attempts, was very unlikely to succeed better. She&#xD;
could not but inspire a strong interest where known fa..&#xD;
miliarly. A system of parental restraint, to which her&#xD;
young companions were not generally subjected, would&#xD;
have engendered in some minds rebellion or deceit.&#xD;
She was too affectionate for the former too fearless for&#xD;
the latter-submissive to authority, yet enjoying with&#xD;
an excess of glee her occasional liberty; and, like a bird&#xD;
who, released for a while from its cage, returns without&#xD;
resistance, she resumed her chain with as pleasant a face&#xD;
as she laid it down. A child in ignorance, she was&#xD;
ecjually so in innocence and unconsciousness.&#xD;
as One morning soon after their removal to the country,&#xD;
she seated herself at her desk in preparation for the&#xD;
recitation, she exclaimed, "Oh, how delighted I am to&#xD;
get back to my study !"&#xD;
"Which of them? Latin, Philosophy, History, or-"&#xD;
"Oh, Mr. Thornley 1" replied she, with a significant&#xD;
smile, and well understanding his look, "You know&#xD;
what I mean-my dear old room, with all my pet things&#xD;
about me&#xD;
"Including your books, of course."'&#xD;
"Books! Yes, some books. Arabian Nights, for in-&#xD;
stance; some poetry, and a few. novels-not musty old&#xD;
dictionaries and grammars.'~&#xD;
"Your catalogue is rather small, Miss Eleanor; it&#xD;
would but scantily furnish a young lady's head."&#xD;
"Oh, I know that you, Mr. Thoruley, would add fol-&#xD;
ios of history, and Heaven knows what! more than my&#xD;
poor little head could contain."&#xD;
"You have never tested its capacity," said Walter,&#xD;

business of the lessons, in hopes of insinuating one in a&#xD;
less repulsive form.&#xD;
Q' Why, do you really believe I can ever learn all the&#xD;
things that you and papa say I must? and if I could,&#xD;
what is the use?' There's history now-what am I the&#xD;
better for knowing that Semiramis lived 1965 years be-&#xD;
fore the Christian era? a good-for-nothing, wicked wom-&#xD;
an, IL don't care when she lived! or that Babylon had a&#xD;
hundred gates? It would be more to me if papa would&#xD;
get one new one at our front entrance. Or that the an-&#xD;
cient Egyptian language was the same in its roots with&#xD;
the modern Coptic? I care a vast deal more about the&#xD;
roots ~f my roses! Or that Cheops succeeded IRhamp-&#xD;
sinitus? Horrid unpronounceable names! That Sesos-&#xD;
tris was a mighty conqueror? and so on."&#xD;
"I must confess," said Walter, involuntarily catching&#xD;
the spirit of frolic that sparkled in her eye," "you have&#xD;
contrived to select facts not very important to you per-&#xD;
sonally; but you should remember, Miss Eleanor, that&#xD;
history, like every department of knowledge, compre-&#xD;
hends many details, not perhaps interesting in them-&#xD;
selves, but preparing the way for what is to follow:&#xD;
thus we float down the stream of time to-"&#xD;
"No, no; I don't float, I sink! and pray don't speak&#xD;
aboutthe stream of time, Mr. Thornley, I beg of you;&#xD;
it only reminds me of that great chart in papa's library,&#xD;
and it makes you seem just like a schoolmaster."&#xD;
"But I am nothing else," Miss Eleanor.&#xD;
"Oh, yes; you are, sometimes. I don't ever want to&#xD;
think of you as a schoolmaster, they are always so dis-&#xD;
agreeable! When you talk to papa and mamma you&#xD;
don't talk so. You think, perhaps, that I don't listen,&#xD;
but I do. I hear every word you say to them."&#xD;
"Eleanor !" said Mrs. Meredith, from 'the hall, "are&#xD;
you tal.kirig or reciting?"'&#xD;
&#xD;
99&#xD;
&#xD;
"Talking, mamma."&#xD;
*      "About your lessons ?"&#xD;
~LNo, mamma.~~&#xD;
"Then please attend to them, and do not waste Mr.&#xD;
Thornley's time."&#xD;
Recalled by this reminder, Eleanor, without a cloud&#xD;
on her brow, opened her book, and, presenting it to Mr.&#xD;
Thornley, the business of the morning began.&#xD;
After a long sitting, and tolerable recitations, she rose,&#xD;
put on her bonnet, her vandyke, and nankeen mitts, in&#xD;
preparation for a walk.&#xD;
"Do, Mr. Thornley, go with me. I am sure you are&#xD;
as tired as I am; and it is so solitary, with only Bruno"&#xD;
-a liver-colored spaniel, her constant attendant. "I&#xD;
did not use to mind it, when I could not have any thing&#xD;
else; but now it is different, and I am sure it would do&#xD;
you good."&#xD;
"No, thank you, Miss Eleanor. I should probably&#xD;
be a dull companion, for walking disposes me to silence."&#xD;
"A silent companion! that is no better than Bruno!"&#xD;
"No; and therefore Ii will not impose myself on you."&#xD;
"Well, I'm sorry! but come, il3runo! my only friend!&#xD;
Mr. Thornley don't care for us, so we'll amuse each oth-&#xD;
er," and off they went.&#xD;
The summer months glided away with occasional dis-&#xD;
appointment, but, on the whole, with increasing satisfac-&#xD;
tion to Walter, who saw that, with now and then a re-&#xD;
lapse, Eleanor was really gaining in application and in-&#xD;
terest in her studies; he, meantime, careful not to in-&#xD;
crease her distaste by undue rigor, secured his influence&#xD;
by his forbearance.&#xD;
One sultry morning, having been detained by atten~&#xD;
tion to her mother, who was slightly indisposed, Elea-&#xD;
nor entered the, study, and, seating herself languidly,&#xD;
exclaimed, "Oh dear! Mr. Thornley, it is so warm&#xD;

"lit is only twenty minutes past the hour. I see no&#xD;
reason why, having lost that much, we need lose more;&#xD;
and as to the heat, the most effectual way to forget it is&#xD;
to be occupied.'1&#xD;
"Oh, you are always so sensible! I wish I were so.&#xD;
Shall I ever be so?"&#xD;
"Ido not know."&#xD;
"Why can't you say you hope so, Mr. Thoruley ?"&#xD;
"I will, if you give me cause to say so."&#xD;
"Have I not done so at all ?" said she, with a re-&#xD;
proachful look. "I'm sure I have tried."&#xD;
Yes, Miss Eleanor; you have done so. I am most&#xD;
happy to admit it; but, you know, to reach the goal, we&#xD;
must not flag by the way."&#xD;
"Well; where are the books? I'll begin."&#xD;
They were produced. The first lesson was a weary&#xD;
one in mathematics; 'indifferently got through with;&#xD;
then a Latin translation to be corrected; English poetry&#xD;
~o.be recited; and then the usual historical reading, with&#xD;
aV review of that of the previous day, presumed, but not&#xD;
proved to have been studied over in the interval. This&#xD;
last,'when she was in the mood, had, in spite of her orig-&#xD;
inal disgust, been rendered, by Walter's commentaries, a&#xD;
favoriteexercise. ~Biit now she was not in the mood.&#xD;
"' Oh, what a tiresome world this has been !" exclaim.&#xD;
ccl she, as. she closed the book. "Nothing but fighting,&#xD;
politics, and wickedness !"&#xD;
"But still, at times, virtue and true greatness. Don't&#xD;
youthink'so?"&#xD;
"Yes; if they would only leave' out all the rest."&#xD;
"' That would be a singular compendium," said Walter,&#xD;
laughing. "Sh~iil I prepare a 'digest' for you, c&amp;amp;isist.&#xD;

and people, and entitle it the 'Philosophy of History, for&#xD;
the use of Miss Eleanor Meredith?'"&#xD;
lEleanor returned his laugh, saying, "Yes, yes, that&#xD;
much I might digest; at present I am surfeited."&#xD;
Walter looked, grave.&#xD;
"May I ask,' Miss Eleanor, which of your studies, so&#xD;
called, do you prefer ?"&#xD;
"Let me see. History, with notes by Mr. Thornley,&#xD;
sometimes quite agreeable; mathematics, so, so; rheto-&#xD;

ral history, pretty well-there's life in that at least; my-&#xD;

French I like very much; drawing, very little; danc-&#xD;

"Yes, with opera and rope dancers; the last especial-&#xD;
ly, who understand some of the laws Miss Meredith. de-&#xD;
spises."&#xD;
"Well, as long as I can move, and see every thing&#xD;
moving about me, ]I can not much care about the laws&#xD;
of motion. If I, and every thing else stood still, I should&#xD;
want to know the reason why."&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith's admonitory voice not raised, and the&#xD;
lessons completed, Eleanor was disposed for farther chat.&#xD;

learn evary thing of you, and you nothing of me? Don't&#xD;
you think I know any thing? Oh, I will show you&#xD;
w~aat a schoolmistress I can be! I sha~{,~ g*e you a full&#xD;
return of the 'stream of time,' departmentss of knowl-&#xD;
edge,' 'digest of history,' 'reaching the goal,' and so on;&#xD;
and make you so ashamed of your 'indolence,' and your&#xD;
'no taste for study!' Now won't you, Mr. Thornley ?"&#xD;
Walter found it impossible to resist her coaxing smile.&#xD;
Beskies, it was an exercise of her faculties, and he con-&#xD;
To this duty she always came with alacrity, and, al-&#xD;
though she at first found infinite amusement in correct-&#xD;
ing him, and even he was diverted out of his propriety,&#xD;
it became more and more a serious occupation, he de-&#xD;
riving a real benefit from it, and she awakened to an en-&#xD;
tirely new ~1ea~ure in this sense of power.&#xD;
Thus, by degrees, Walter led her on, sometimes 'by&#xD;
exhortation, sometimes by turning to good account her&#xD;
childlike flashes of fun or her merry caprices, but always&#xD;
preserving his own ascendency. From a progress at&#xD;
first scarcely perceptible her advance was accelerated, till&#xD;
her young mind, effectually stirred by new ideas, became&#xD;
eager for more and higher.&#xD;
She would sit listening in Tapt attention as Walter,&#xD;
with gentle earnestness, pointed out to her how, through&#xD;
the beggarlyy elements" of teaching, she might ascend&#xD;
to an enlarged application of these first principles-to an&#xD;
understanding of how the facts of other times became&#xD;
the instructors of her own, and how even Error prepared&#xD;
a highway for Truth. How Nature, grand and beauti-&#xD;
ful as she is, often taught us by the meanest agencies;&#xD;
how "si1k~worms turned the philosophy of Sir Thomas&#xD;
Browne into divinity," and "that Reason may go to&#xD;
school to bees, and ar~ts, and spiders ;" that&#xD;

&#xD;
"Nothing's mean,&#xD;
But every common bush afire with God."&#xD;
How, through dry and abstract mathematics, which had&#xD;
so often wearied her, the heavens which she loved to&#xD;
contemplate would be comprehended, and she would&#xD;
thus ascend to Him "who sitteth above the heav-&#xD;
ens.~~&#xD;
It was a subject for a painter-that young, childlike&#xD;
girl-that youthful teacher, wise beyond his years.&#xD;
On one. occasion, when seated in the western piazza,&#xD;
at sunset, her eye intent on the lovely planet, "compan-&#xD;
ion of retiring day," she looked as if; with the poet, she&#xD;
would have asked,&#xD;
"Why, at the closing gates of heaven,&#xD;
Beloved star, dost thou delay ?"&#xD;
Waite; interpreting her curious gaze, said, "Sh~.ll I tell&#xD;
you ?" and proceeded to explain the phenomenon. As&#xD;
he concluded, she impulsively put her hand. on his arm,&#xD;
and exclaimed with animation, "How beautiful it is to&#xD;
know all these things !"&#xD;
Walter was touched; the young spirit had come at&#xD;
his call; but he replied, calmly,&#xD;
"Yes; and do you not feel that it makes you hap.&#xD;
pier, too, Eleanor?"&#xD;
"Oh yes, indeed; I never was half so happy in my&#xD;
life."&#xD;
"He called me 'Eleanor,"' thought she; "I wish he&#xD;
would never again say '.ZiEss Elean .'"&#xD;
At another time, when an aurora was sending up&#xD;
"Its waving brightness, she,&#xD;
Curious, surveyed, inquisitive to know&#xD;
The causes and materials, yet uufix'd,&#xD;
Of this appearance, beautiful and new,"&#xD;
and bent her inquiring eyes on Walter.&#xD;
He shook his head. "I can give you only conject-&#xD;

tires; but," added he, with a smile, "as you profess to&#xD;
like fancy better than law, perhaps you will be satisfied&#xD;
with them."&#xD;
K~ Oh no,". said she, hastily, with a conscious look at&#xD;
the ~remembrance of her former complacent ignorance,&#xD;
"Oh no, not now; n~w I like to understand every thing&#xD;
-~-every thing that you teach me."&#xD;
He answered by remarks on equatorial regions, phos-&#xD;
phorescent lights, earth's motion, and so on-very grave,&#xD;
and, as Eleanor thought, very wise; but which, being,&#xD;
perhaps, behind this more scientific age, it may be best&#xD;
not to expQse.&#xD;
But sometimes a small cloud would come across their&#xD;
fair heaven. Mr. Meredith, not a passionate or harsh-&#xD;
tempered man, could, nevertheless, occasionally be stern,&#xD;
and, unfortunately, did not always discriminate between&#xD;
greater and lesser faults.&#xD;
One morning Eleanor was a laggard at the breakfast-&#xD;
table, and her father's reproving eye gave effect to his&#xD;
inquiry:&#xD;
"Pray what has made you so late, Miss Eleanor?"&#xD;
Rather fluttered by her delinquency, she replied, "I&#xD;
was up late, papa, reading."&#xD;
"Reading! and what ?"&#xD;
"A novel, papa, that Emily Morton lent me last even-&#xD;
ing when I went to see her; a very-"&#xD;
"A novel I" interrupted her father, in a tone of sur-&#xD;
prise and displeasure; "a novel! borrowed and read&#xD;
without my knowledge 1"&#xD;
"Indeed, papa, I was-going--.-"&#xD;
But her embarrassment only confirmed her father in&#xD;
the suspicion of a deliberate disregard of an injunction&#xD;
to which perhaps he attached undue importance, "to&#xD;
read only such novels as he should suggest or approve,"&#xD;
and, with increased displeasure, he added," You may re-&#xD;
&#xD;
tire to your roo~"-a permission which, however un-&#xD;
graciously given, was readily obeyed to hide the tears&#xD;
that were starting to her eyes.&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith looked disturbed, but, as she generally&#xD;
inclined to believe her husband right, she did not inter-&#xD;
fere. But Walter was not so passive; and, when Mr.&#xD;
Meredith, in expectation of his sympathy, expressed in&#xD;
strong terms his determination to "exclude from his&#xD;
house the pernicious trash circulated in the shape of nov-&#xD;
els, and .to enforce obedience the more .tigidly as he saw&#xD;
the prevailing tendency to the contrary," Walter ven-&#xD;
tured, as to 1~he last, to demur.&#xD;
"I think, sir," he said, "if I may be permitted so to&#xD;
say; that you were rather precipitate with Miss Ele-&#xD;
anor."&#xD;
"Precipitate! flow so ?"&#xD;
"You did not allow her time for explanation, sir. I&#xD;
have no doubt that, if not an entire justificationt, she has&#xD;
a sufficient apology."&#xD;
Mr. Meredith for some moments maintained his own&#xD;
side, but Walter did not yield, and it ended in his being&#xD;
allowed to mediate, that the present ~unpleasant feeling&#xD;
on both sides might cease as soon as possible.&#xD;
He found Eleanor in the study, her eyes red ~vith&#xD;
weeping, and her voice still tremulous, but with no sign&#xD;
of ill-humor. Encouraged by him, she was soon calm,&#xD;
and gave the required explanation. The book had been&#xD;
recommended by Mr. Morton to his daughter, and Ele-&#xD;
anor had brought it home with the intention of asking&#xD;
her father's permission to read it, but he was in town,&#xD;
and would not return till morning. "And then," con-&#xD;
tinued she, "I only opened it to see what sort of a book&#xD;
it was; and it was so interesting that I forgot myself&#xD;
and read till quite late. But, Mr. Thoruley, it can not&#xD;
do me any harm, for there is no love in it. They told mc&#xD;

so, or I should not have looked into it without papa's&#xD;

Mr. '~hornley ?"&#xD;
Walter answered, with due gravity and caution, that&#xD;
he should hope not.&#xD;
"And I'm sure," continued she, "I am safe enough,&#xD;
for I don't care so much for any gentleman I know as&#xD;
to fall in love with him." Then, with a sudden reflec~~&#xD;
tion on ~what struck her as ill-manners, she added the&#xD;
common qualification, saying, with an innocent smile,&#xD;
"except you, Mr. Thornley; I beg your pardon, I did&#xD;
not mean to say that I did not care for you; that would&#xD;
be very rude and ungrateful, I am sure."&#xD;
Walter, quietly assuring her that he should never im-&#xD;
pute rudeness to her, returned to the subject in hand,&#xD;
and, furnished with her explanation, apology, and the&#xD;
offending volume, which proved to be "Caleb Williams,"&#xD;
peace was restored.&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
THE quiet of the Oaks was not, however, to be undis-&#xD;
turbed. His garden, to which Mr. Meredith had retired&#xD;
on his return from a hot day in town-the flowers,&#xD;
whose bloom and fragrance seemed emulously to offer&#xD;
an acknowledgment of his care-~-the music of the birds,&#xD;
whom his shrubberies invited and his mercy protected,&#xD;
could not dispel the cloud from his brow. Pestilence&#xD;
had breathed on the city! and the coming woe was al-&#xD;
ready to be seen.&#xD;
"Amid those scenes of late so fair&#xD;
The Demon of the Plague had cast&#xD;
From his hot wing a deadly blast I"&#xD;
Scarcely a month had gone since sounds of joy and&#xD;
exultation from all ages and every class had filled the&#xD;
air, where now was only silent dread or loud foreboding;&#xD;
where hands had. been clasped in friendly greetings,&#xD;
and congratulations exchanged, neighbors avoided each&#xD;
other, or met but to confirm their mutual fears. Bon..&#xD;
fires and illuminations, that, in accordance with the sen-&#xD;
timent of the elder Adams, had expressed a natiQn's joy,&#xD;
were replaced by lurid flames and heavy smok&amp;amp;-.--sup-&#xD;
posed preventive of contagion-more 4uly the portents&#xD;
of death. Peace and war, so lately occupying all minds,&#xD;
were forgotten in smaller considerations of personal&#xD;
safety.&#xD;
The consternation soon became general. All fled but&#xD;
those whom imperious duty, humanity, or poverty de-&#xD;
tained. More than half the population abandoned the&#xD;
city, finding refuge in the neighboring towns and vil-&#xD;
lages, in country residences, or in slight dwellings hastily&#xD;

erected in great number over the is~Iand. Business was&#xD;
suspended; but persons from out of town ventured to&#xD;
the post-office-removed to the corner of Wall Street&#xD;
and broadway-at certain hours, it having been pro-&#xD;
nounced by medical men safe to do so; and clergymen,&#xD;
who bad sought safety in Greenwich and Bloemendal,&#xD;
came at stated times for the performance of religious&#xD;
service.&#xD;
But Why sadden a simple story with farther details?&#xD;
Plagne and Pestilence have had their chroniclers, from&#xD;
Thucydides to Grant Thorburn; Boccaccio, De Foe, Man-&#xD;
zoni, and others. All tell of human nature the same&#xD;
tale. Its cowardice and courage, its selfishness and gen-&#xD;
erosity, its desperate mockery, its palsied stupefaction,&#xD;
its blind fatalism, and its Christian submission.&#xD;
But Time, whether he "shed odors" or tears "from his&#xD;
wings," must pass. The summer, with its weight of woe&#xD;
and anxiety~ went "to the years beyond the flood," and&#xD;
autumn, never more welcome, came. Frost, ofteu the&#xD;
extinguisher of life, was how hailed as its only hope,&#xD;
and with the advancing season th~ fugitives began to&#xD;
return.&#xD;
In. November the Merediths were re-established in&#xD;
Broadway. At first the change. was oppressive. The&#xD;
mounting garments, the sad faces, the sorrowful details&#xD;
that daily met them, seemed scarcely endurable. But&#xD;
with~ the returning current of life the ravages of death&#xD;
were gradually obliterated. If people met to lament&#xD;
for~ the lost,, they lingered to rejoice for the living; the&#xD;
very extent of the calamity magnifying the deliverance,&#xD;
and sorroW for the inevitable past yielding to wonder&#xD;
at the scarce credible present.&#xD;
Eleanor in the. grave town library regretted the airy&#xD;
cheerful country study, endeared to her by pleasant and&#xD;
profitable occupation; but her tutor and her lessons re-&#xD;

gained, and these sufficed for her. Walter encouraged&#xD;
in proportion as she was interested, instruction was no&#xD;
longer a task to either; and, but that her young com-&#xD;
panions gathered round her and would not be denied,&#xD;
her thoughts would have seldom wandered from it.&#xD;
"Holidays" next brought an interruption, though El-&#xD;
eanor declared her indifference to the amusements pro-&#xD;
posed. But, in conformity to custom almost religiously&#xD;
observed, festivity ruled the hour, and the young came&#xD;
in for their share. Sleighing parties to "Love Lane,"&#xD;
Haerlein, and Kingsbridge; oyster suppers and danc-&#xD;
ing; the streets musical with sleigh-bells; the side-&#xD;
walks, though icy and dangerous, filled with well-dress-&#xD;
ed people, gave token of the respect paid to ancestral&#xD;
usages. Among the pleasures of the time were its du-&#xD;
ties, and respectful calls on gray-headed friends were n~ot&#xD;
omitted by the young. Eleanor, appropriately attired&#xD;
in a dark-green silk cardinal, lined and trimmed with&#xD;
fur, a hat to correspond, muffed and tippeted, and her&#xD;
feet protected by galoches, had been thus occupying&#xD;
the morning; and after presenting the "compliments of&#xD;
the season" to certain ancient ladies, the friends of her&#xD;
family, was on her return.&#xD;
In crossing Broadway, the near approach of a sleigh&#xD;
with mettlesome horses startled her, to escape which she&#xD;
quickened her pace, slipped on the glazed and treacher-&#xD;
ous flagging, and fell just as she reached the curbstone.&#xD;
The driver instantly checked his speed, and a young&#xD;
man sprang from the sleigh and hastened to her assist-&#xD;
ance. With expressions of the greatest regret he at-&#xD;
tempted to raise her; but, though she tried to aid him&#xD;
by her own exertions, she found it impossible to do so,&#xD;
Perceiving her changing color, and the necessity of im-&#xD;
mediate relief; he lifted her in his arms, bore her to the&#xD;
sleigh, and placed her in it, where, nearly fainting with&#xD;
&#xD;

pain, she sank back powerless on the cushiQuS, juSt able,&#xD;
in reply to the gentleman's eager inquiry for her resi-&#xD;
denc~e, to give the number of her father's house.&#xD;
In a few moments they were at the door. To lift her&#xD;
from the sleigh and ascend the steps was the work of an&#xD;
instant, though the young man seemed too slight for the&#xD;
burden. The bell was answered as soon as most bells&#xD;
are, but there was time for the distressed Eleanor to&#xD;
stammer forth her thanks before James appeared? his&#xD;
usual dull face excited to consternation~ at the sight of&#xD;
"young missus in the ~arms of a strange gentleman."&#xD;
This last, however, offered no apology for ~the liberty,&#xD;
but, hurrying to the first open door, deposited his charge&#xD;
on a sofa, to the yet greater terror of Mrs. Meredith, and,&#xD;
having explained the accident, begged to be directed to&#xD;
a physician. In the uncertainty of the amount of inju-&#xD;
ry, the offer was not to be declined; and the gentleman,&#xD;
giving his card, with a request to be permitted to make&#xD;
inquiries the next day, disappeared.&#xD;
The physician soon came. On examination it proved&#xD;
that no bone was fractured; but a severely sprained an-&#xD;
kle and a bad bruise were sufficient to produce the suf-&#xD;
fering. Rest was imperatively enjoined, and this, with&#xD;
proper external applications, would, he hoped, soon re-&#xD;
store her.&#xD;
As this conclusion was arrived at; Mr. Meredith and&#xD;
Walter entered. They had been met at the door by the&#xD;
usual exaggerations, "Miss Eleanor had been run over,&#xD;
her leg broken, and she was very bad !" but Eleanor's&#xD;
voice assured them.&#xD;
"Don't be frightened, papa. Oh, Mr. Thornley, don't&#xD;
look so! 'tis only a sprain, and I shall be well directly."&#xD;
~Xrs. Meredith, having given the particulars, with&#xD;
many comments on the young gentleman's "sensible&#xD;
behavior produced his card.&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEE? AT THE rAST.           111&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have heard. the name," said Mr. Meredith, "but I&#xD;
don't know the family," and he handed it to Walter.&#xD;
"Oscar Middleton V.' he exclaimed, with surprise.&#xD;
"Do you know him ?" asked Mr. Meredith.&#xD;
"I once met him; 'tis long ago, when we were boys ;"&#xD;
and but for "the letter," which flashed across him, he&#xD;
would have said more; as it was, he remained silent.&#xD;
The violence of the pain yielded to good care, but&#xD;
Eleanor continued lame, and a prisoner.. Mr. Middleton&#xD;
called the next day, but saw only Mrs. Meredith, upon&#xD;
whom his kind inquiries, his regrets, his good looks and.&#xD;
good manners made an agreeable impression. Almost&#xD;
daily calls eiisued; yet he and Walter did not meet un-&#xD;
til one morning, just as Oscar rang for admission, Wal-&#xD;
ter opened the hall-door in order to go out.&#xD;
Oscar did not appear to observe him, but stood await-&#xD;
ing the servant. For a moment Walter suspected his&#xD;
inattention to be design, and was about to pass him with&#xD;
equal indifference. Better thoughts prevailed. "He&#xD;
may not," he reflected, "recollect me; I should not,&#xD;
perhaps, have recognized him under other circum-&#xD;
stances." The "letter" was no longer remembered as&#xD;
he looked in, that kind young face; he stopped, extend-&#xD;
ed his hand, and said, "Oscar Middleton, have you for-&#xD;
gotten Walter Thornley ?"&#xD;
Oscar started, the color rushed to his cheek, his eye&#xD;
sparkled, and, grasping the hand that was offered, he&#xD;
exclaimed, "F6~gotten him! never!"~&#xD;
The appearance of James interrupted farther commu-&#xD;
njcation. Foregoing a visit, leaving compliments and a&#xD;
card, he turned to his friend, saying,&#xD;
"Come, let me go with you; and you shall tell me&#xD;
all I want so much to know-'where you have been, and&#xD;
why you are here ;" and, taking his arm, they descend-.&#xD;
ed the steps.&#xD;

&#xD;
112         WALTER TIIORM4EY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
In few words Oscar was in possession of all that there&#xD;
was to tell.&#xD;
"And so you are the tutor of. the little girl I came&#xD;
nea~ killing~ Upon. my soul, I envy you! Why, she&#xD;
is one ~of the lovelisst creatures I ever saw. Don't you&#xD;
think so&#xD;
"That would be a very safe assertion for me," replied&#xD;
Walter, laughing, " as my observation has not been&#xD;
large, Mid, for the same reason, not very compliment-&#xD;
ary; but, coming from you, it is worth something;&#xD;
however, I shall nQt deny that she is a pretty child, and,&#xD;
what is better, quite studious."&#xD;
"Pshaw! that sounds so pedagogic; and 'child,' too!&#xD;
why, Walter, I shall renounce you if you've grown&#xD;
priggish."&#xD;
"Oh, I only spoke professionally. If I call- her child,&#xD;
it is from the relation in which I stand. to. her, and be-&#xD;
cause ~she is such in naturalness and docility, so much&#xD;
so that I really forget her age. But tell me oC yourself.&#xD;
You are tall, and strong, I hope, in proportion)'&#xD;
"Oh, yes; those springs cured me. I repeated the&#xD;
dose the next year, and since that I am well, as isay,&#xD;
though my careful mother will not hear of a profession,&#xD;
and keeps me forever in the open air. She has a theory&#xD;
about constitutions much the same as about trees: that&#xD;
the fibre of the young wood must have time to become&#xD;
tough and hardy before exposure. She gives me, I be..&#xD;
lieve, till five-and-twenty to acquire a close grain and a&#xD;
rough bark, and after that I may be trusted to do some-&#xD;
thing. In the mean time, if I happen to cough, she&#xD;
sighs; but you see how fresh and strong I look."&#xD;
Walter saw indeed that his color was bright, but he&#xD;
feared he overrated' his strength. He changed the sub-&#xD;
ject.&#xD;
"And how is your mother? I can never forget her,&#xD;
&#xD;
K&#xD;
&#xD;
though I can hardly hope that she has any remembrance&#xD;
of me."&#xD;
"Indeed, you are greatly~ mistaken, She often talks&#xD;
of you, and always in the kindest terms. In truth, you&#xD;
must have taken a pretty strong possession of all our&#xD;
hearts; for whenever my father, in reproof of my short-&#xD;
comings, proposes a model for my imitation, h~ chooses&#xD;
you, and I listen without jealousy. They will both be&#xD;
'~j delighted to see you. We live about six miles from&#xD;
town. My father hates a city, and therefore we remain&#xD;
at the 'Lodge' summer and winter. Tell me when you&#xD;
will go, and I will drive you out."&#xD;
This was embarrassing. It was plain that Oscar was&#xD;
unconscious of the "letter," and Walter was willing to&#xD;
believe that his mother was equally so; but there was&#xD;
the fact, only aggravated by the insincere commenda-&#xD;
tions that Mr. Middleton had bestowed on him. His&#xD;
mind was entirely~settled; go to the house he would&#xD;
not. He must excuse himself to Oscar as he best could.&#xD;
Meanwhile, he had the comfort of finding him un-&#xD;
changed; and as, in consequence of his almost. familiar&#xD;
admission to Mr. Meredith's, he should often see him, he&#xD;
was satisfied, and hoped that his friend would be so like-&#xD;
wise.&#xD;
The good impression made by Oscar prompted to&#xD;
some attention to his parents. Accordingly Mr. and&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith called on them, were~ charmed with the&#xD;
lady, not much pleased with the gentleman. The visit&#xD;
was returned by Mrs. Middleton alone, with an apology&#xD;
on the part of her husband, and the intercourse went no&#xD;
farther, Mr. Meredith setting him down as a churl not&#xD;
worth the trouble of seeking, ,and Walter regretting&#xD;
that, being from, home, he had lost the only chance of&#xD;
seeing Mrs. Middleton.&#xD;

WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
from the confinement of her room, was now permitted&#xD;
to recline on a sofa in the parlor. As soon as he might&#xD;
be ad~iitted, Oscar was allowed to see and congratulate&#xD;
her; and he did so with so many protestations of sorrow&#xD;
and shame for the suffering he had caused that Eleanor&#xD;
could not help feeling a little important. Flattery had&#xD;
seldom fallen on her inexperienced ear. Her young&#xD;
companions were more likely to tell disagreeable truths;&#xD;
her father's cautious commendations were always accom-&#xD;
panied by deductions; her mother, though affectionate,&#xD;
was not demonstrative; and "Mr. Thornley! he never&#xD;
paid her a compliment in his life !"&#xD;
As a part of their rather rigid system, Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
J Ms~rcdith resisted an early introduction into geneTal so-&#xD;
ciety; but they looked approvingly on Eleanor's inter-&#xD;
course with a small circle of young friends, consisting&#xD;
of girls of her own age, with their brothers and inti-&#xD;
mates, who met at their respective houses in turn, often&#xD;
presided over by a mamma or elder sister. Dancing&#xD;
was varied by the innocent, if not very intellectual&#xD;
games of Pope Joan, Cassimo, and the like. Charades,&#xD;
crambo, and conundrums had their turn; early hours&#xD;
prevented all waste of their fine spirits, and a simple re-&#xD;
freshment was entirely satisfactory to youths as yet not&#xD;
vitiated by "Broadway saloons."&#xD;
"Mr. Thornley," said Eleanor, one day, "iii do wish&#xD;
you would join our cotillion parties."&#xD;
"I have no invitation, Miss Eleanor."&#xD;
"Oh, that is only because the girls think you too grave,&#xD;
and too-.too--.--olc4 perhaps," she added, with a smile.&#xD;
"And as I never dance, you know, they would onlybe&#xD;

"f would not so much abridge your enjoyment, Miss&#xD;
Eleanor.~~&#xD;
"But it would be better for me; for mamma is rather&#xD;
afraid of my dancing much, since the sprain I got."&#xD;
"Ah! but I should disappoint others-Mr. Middleton,&#xD;
for instance."&#xD;
"Oh, I only danced with him so often because he was&#xD;
a stranger, but now he is quite~ acquainted with them&#xD;
all, and can do very well without me; so do go, please,&#xD;
Mr. Thornley, I can arrange it easily."&#xD;
"Excuse me, Miss Eleanor. I will compromise the&#xD;
matter; when your friends meet here I will not absent&#xD;
myself.~?                               (&#xD;
Accordingly, on the next occasion, Walter remained&#xD;
with the young people. At first some of the more&#xD;
thoughtless exclaimed, "Eleanor's tutor! ,dear me, we&#xD;
shall not dare to speak !"&#xD;
But they soon fo~nd the "tutor" a valuable addition,&#xD;
not only taking part in every game, but making accept-&#xD;
able suggestions. Am others he proposed "charac-&#xD;
ters?" which, furnishing a little mental stimulus, added&#xD;
to the excitement. Kings, queens, and nobles, as their&#xD;
memory served them, were enacted by the young repub-&#xD;
licans-exultant in their short-lived honors. On his&#xD;
own part, Walter, adapting himself to the topics of the&#xD;
day, and furnished by the ingenuity of Eleanor with&#xD;
the symbolical red cap, appeared as a furious Jacobin.&#xD;
So successfully did he travestie the extravagance and&#xD;
the assumption r ntly exhibited by the French agents&#xD;
in: this country- o well dPI he propitiate the admiring&#xD;
"6i~yens" and "citoyennes" around him with greetings&#xD;
of ~" Health and Fraternity !"-so happily interlard his&#xD;
speech with Gallicisms, the "Rights of Man "and the pre-&#xD;
vailing political slang, that at its conclusion, "Qa ira! ~a&#xD;

IIE$        WALTER THORNLEY; OR,                                            A PEEP AT THE PAST.          117&#xD;
&#xD;
in so loud a~key, that Mr. Meredith, roused from his la-&#xD;
bors in the library, entered the room to check their mer-&#xD;
rimept, but remained to share it.&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith, who, seated at her work, had been an&#xD;
amused spectator, now proposed, as something more&#xD;
quiet, "Mottoes," an entertainment that has descended&#xD;
to our day. These consisted of lines addressed to each&#xD;
person, complimentary or otherwise. The idea was ac-&#xD;
cepted, dnd immediately, pens, ink, and paper being pro-&#xD;
duced, all heads and hands were at work. But the as-&#xD;
pirants met the usual difficulty that obstructs such first&#xD;
efforts. Pens were n~ended; dipped and redipped; ink&#xD;
flowed, but not ideas; brows were knit, foreheads rub-&#xD;
bed, and lips, perhaps nails, bitten; but little was effect-&#xD;
ed. During this perturbation, Walter had, unobserved,&#xD;
slipped his contribution into the vase placed to receive&#xD;
It, and then occupied himself with a book while waiting&#xD;
for the 4istracte.d ebullitions of the rest.&#xD;
Eleanor, nibbling the end of her pen, bending over&#xD;
three or four. lines complete, except the rhymes, and try-&#xD;
ing in vain to find harmonies for "sage and grace," look-&#xD;
ed up, exclaiming, "Why, Mr. Thornley, you not writ;&#xD;
ing I then pray help me."&#xD;
Walter suggested "rage and lace," "cage and brace,"&#xD;
"wage and chase."&#xD;
"No, no, won't do," said Eleanor, shaking 'her head.&#xD;
"Let me see the subject, and perhaps I may suggest&#xD;
something that will suit you."&#xD;
"Oh no, no, not for the world I"&#xD;
"Well, then, P11 try again: 'page and trace,' 'gauge&#xD;
and base,' 'stage and pace."'&#xD;
Again she shook her head; but, presently, having&#xD;
found what she sought, she, with a merry look at Wal-&#xD;
ter, tossed a slip of paper into the vase.&#xD;
At length the work was achieved, and the results&#xD;
&#xD;
drawn forth with as much interest as if votes from an&#xD;
electoral urn-if not as important, quite as inflammatory.&#xD;
For such was the accumulation oh the part of the gen-&#xD;
tlemen, in the taste of the time, of darts hearts, fire ex-&#xD;
pire, love dove, glow woe, blaze craze, that, like a bun-&#xD;
dle of locofocos, they should have been kept in a match-&#xD;
safe, at least till the young. ladies were marriageable. A&#xD;
few of the least dangerous may be offered to the reader.&#xD;
One, a cut at Oscar for his gallantry, another at Walter&#xD;
for his gravity, and two of a more sentimental descrip-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
A slip inscribed "To Mr. Middleton" ran thus:&#xD;
"Sir Calydore you sure should be*&#xD;
Knight of gentle courtesy~!&#xD;
With smiles receive him, ladies all,&#xD;
He only lives to be your thraliP'&#xD;
Another to "Mr. Thornley," thus:&#xD;
"How wondroxw to see Mr. Thoruley, the' sage,&#xD;
Our juvenile sports here to grace-&#xD;
Believe me, that smiles will enliven your e,&#xD;
And smooth out the lines from yo  e!"&#xD;
While this was reading, Eleanor, reminded of hay-&#xD;
ing betrayed her authorship, listened rather uneasily.&#xD;
Though it cost her some trouble, it sounded; when read,&#xD;
flat, and not over civil; and its good-humored accept-&#xD;
ance hardly relieved her.&#xD;
To this succeeded one addressed "To Mrs. Meredith :"&#xD;
"What meets us at the hour of birth,&#xD;
Nor leaves us till we pass from earth&#xD;
To spheres above?&#xD;
Exhaustless gives, and, suffering long,&#xD;
Forgives unask'd, through sin and wrong;&#xD;
Speaks in the last, the parting breath,&#xD;
And still undying conquers Death?&#xD;
A mother's love!&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith accepted it with a look that sufficiently&#xD;

118          WALTER TBORNLEY; OR,                                            A PEEP AT THE PAST.           119&#xD;
&#xD;
repaid the tribute, and Eleanor thought she knew who&#xD;
had offered it.&#xD;
Tha next was addressed to herself:&#xD;
"Maiden! with those truthful eyes,&#xD;
Within whose heart a fountain lies&#xD;
Of feeling fresh and rare!&#xD;
Oh, waste not life's sweet dewy prime,&#xD;
Though joy may prune the wings of Time,&#xD;
Be wise as you are fair!'&#xD;
She held out her hand to receive it; then, without&#xD;
speaking, turned aw~iy, in order to secure it. Walter&#xD;
continued to read, apparently unobservant of what was&#xD;
passing. Presently, one of the young ladies said,&#xD;
"What have you done with your motto, Eleanor? I&#xD;
did not half hear it; let me see it."&#xD;
"Not now" she replied; and then, in a low voice?&#xD;
added, with a significant gesture, "It was good advice,&#xD;
and I have 'laid it to heart."'&#xD;
Thus occupied, dancing was forgotten. The hour of&#xD;
separation came; and, as soon as her friends had gone,&#xD;
Eleanor, turning to Walter, exelaim~d, "How agreeable&#xD;
you have b~en, Mr. Thornley! The girls w~re all de-&#xD;
lighted,. and~say you must alway~ meet with us."&#xD;
"They are very good; but that would be hardly safe,&#xD;
I fear."&#xD;
"Notsafe! Why?"&#xD;
"Every one can not endure pleasure as well as you&#xD;
do, Miss Eleanor. It would quite turn my head, though&#xD;
yours is so little affected by it."&#xD;
"Oh ~" said she, hali~ ashamed, yet rather reproachful~.&#xD;
ly, "I know what you mean but it is not so. Only I&#xD;
have so ni'any things to o !"&#xD;
He said no more; but his resolution was taken, and&#xD;
an opportunity soon offered for making it known.&#xD;
"I think, Mr. Thornley," said Mr. Meredith, " that the~&#xD;
large - indulgence permitted to Eleanor-in good part&#xD;
&#xD;
I.&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
owing to her accident---should now be restricted. We&#xD;
have had party-going enough. I shall speak to her&#xD;
mother about it."&#xD;
"If you will allow me, sir, I was about to say what&#xD;
will, perhaps, induce you to continue your indulgence.&#xD;
I wish to visit my friends at Ashton, and, if agreeable&#xD;
to you, would take this time for the purpose. By-and-&#xD;
by Miss Eleanor will return to study with a greater&#xD;
zest. We must not expect too much, nor require every&#xD;
young lady to be a 'Jane Grey'.-to prefer," he added,&#xD;
with a smile, "the 'divine Grecian' to an Oscar Middle~&#xD;
ton."&#xD;
"No; children will be fools-and you really wish&#xD;
this ?"&#xD;
"Ido, sir."&#xD;
"Then I have no more to say, though I can not but&#xD;
regret it. Wh~wwould you go?"&#xD;
"In two days, sir;"&#xD;
"And when return ?"&#xD;
Walter hesitated, looked perplexed, even troubled.&#xD;
"Will you certainly require my services, sir? Our&#xD;
year, though not completed, shall be so considered if you&#xD;
desire it. I do not hold you to any engagement."&#xD;
"I do not desire it," replied Mr. Meredith, with em-&#xD;
phasis. "You have satisfied me in all respects, and II&#xD;
prefer you should return."&#xD;
Still Walter hesitated, but at length bowed, and gave&#xD;
what he could hardly conceal was a reluctant assent.&#xD;
"You will have the goodness, then, sir, to menVic~n tho&#xD;
matter to Mrs. Meredith and to Miss Eleanor, and I will&#xD;
make the few preparations that I require."&#xD;
On farther reflection, it was decided that, as in conse-&#xD;
quence of domestic arrangements they would remove to&#xD;
the country earlier the ensuing spring, Walter's furlough&#xD;
should extend till they were settled at the "Oaks."&#xD;

&#xD;
This appeared to relieve him, and he replied iliore,&#xD;
readily,&#xD;
shall come, sir, at the time appointed, unless you&#xD;
"There's little fear of that."&#xD;
The young circle met again at Mrs. Meredith's, and&#xD;
Waiter was escaping from the drawing~-r6om, when a&#xD;
glance' from Eleanor, who, by the side of Oscar, was pre-&#xD;
pared f6r a cotillon, seemed to reproach his desertion.&#xD;
"'Tis the last evening," thought he, and he remained;&#xD;
and, leaning against a window near her, followed the&#xD;
dancers with an abstracted look. Presently a change in&#xD;
the air recalled him, and, drawing nearer, he found Ele-&#xD;
anor dancing the "coquette." She was, in her merriest&#xD;
mood, just making the accustomed feint of presenting&#xD;
her hand to her partner, when she suddenly turned to&#xD;
Walter, who, before he could comprehend her purpose,&#xD;
found himself whirled round, an involuntary partaker&#xD;
of the dance, much to the amusement of all. The next&#xD;
change was the prisonerr;" and Oscar, catching Ele~&#xD;
an~c~is frolic spirit~ insteadof allowing himself to be en-&#xD;
circled, made one of the~ ring, and so extended it as to&#xD;
entrap Walter, who, thus caught, folded his arms with a&#xD;
submissive air, while his captors tripped ~gayly round&#xD;
him; but, as soon as released, made good his retreat to&#xD;
his own room.&#xD;
*":The~e~he goes !" said Oscar to Eleanor; "what can&#xD;
he have so important to do ?"&#xD;
* "Oh, he is never, idle a moment!" she replied, send-&#xD;
ing a i~egretful'l6ok after him. ~" When he is not teach-&#xD;
ing me, unworthy that I am, heis reading law."&#xD;
"Law! as a profession ?"&#xD;
"Yes; and papa has advisedi~im what to read."&#xD;
O~ar~ became thoughtful, and received a rebuke fo~&#xD;
his inattenti6n.&#xD;
&#xD;
II&#xD;
&#xD;
Walter, meanwhile, took the measure of his room&#xD;
more than once, turned over his books, did not feellike&#xD;
reading, leaned on the mantle-piece, ruminated as he&#xD;
looked into the fire, resumed his walk "autour de sa chain-&#xD;
bre," and wasted the evening in unprofitable thought, till&#xD;
roused by a tap at the door, and the entrance of Oscar..&#xD;
"Ahi you shabby fellow, to desert us 1', he exclaim-&#xD;
ed; "but I can not abuse you as you deserve; I am&#xD;
too sorry! Mr. Meredith tells me you are going away,&#xD;
Walter; can this be?"&#xD;
"Yes; but only for a short time; at most not more~&#xD;
than three or four months."&#xD;
"But you. and I may not meet so soon."&#xD;
"You! you are not going too ?"&#xD;
"Yes; in a little time Ii shall be off; seeking what I&#xD;
may never find, at least to the degree that is necessary&#xD;
to keep my parents quiet. I have been more plague&#xD;
than pleasure to them thus far. If they would only not&#xD;
insist on my being perfectly well, they and I could enjoy&#xD;
life without this perpetual struggle after health.. A.s it&#xD;
is, I must meet the embraces of the spring in the sunny&#xD;
south, instead of awaiting her caprices here, merely be-&#xD;
cause they hear me cough once in four-and-twenty&#xD;
hours."&#xD;
"But you will return as soon. as they think it safe for&#xD;
you here?"&#xD;
~No; they have some half-formed plans that may&#xD;
keep us all away, no one can. say how long. But we&#xD;
won't talk of this just now. My dear Walter, I fear you&#xD;
think me but a thoughtless\boy; yet I am not quite' so&#xD;
much so as I seem. But I did. not come here to speak~&#xD;
of myself. 'Tis you of whom Jam thinking.. For som~&#xD;

have been a useful friend, had you allowed him so to be.&#xD;
Nay, don't interrupt me with disclaimers and explima-&#xD;
tions; let that pass. You had your reasons, I dare say;&#xD;
peAiaps good ones. But, now, hear me patiently. My&#xD;
father has, for some time, made me a liberal allowance-&#xD;
much more than I required; for, fearing the effect of the&#xD;
'incessant guardianship, which he thinks my very life re-&#xD;
quires, he enlarges my liberty in every way that can.&#xD;
conduce to selfdependence. I pretend not to be better&#xD;
than other youths, but, as a matter of taste, I hate vice;&#xD;
and, if I have not abused his indulgence, I have to thank&#xD;
the pure influence of my mother, who has formed that&#xD;
taste. But this, though introductory, is yet aside from&#xD;
my object, which, in plain truth, is to say that I have&#xD;
husbanded some three hundred pounds, and that you&#xD;
must take them. They are my own, as you perceive,&#xD;
but, remaining in my hands, are useless. I therefore&#xD;
transfer them to yours, as ][ have the right to do. You&#xD;
propose to yourself an honorable career. You will suc-&#xD;
ceed; you can not fail; but something m'u~st be wanted&#xD;
at the outset.'&#xD;
Walter took the hand that' had rested beseechingly~on&#xD;
his, but he did not speak-he could but press it-while&#xD;
he endeavored to suppress his emotions.&#xD;
Oscar, receiving this as assent, returned the pressure,&#xD;
and said eagerly, "Now that's a good fellow! that's like&#xD;
yourself. I am the person obliged, and a frank accept-&#xD;
ance-doubles the favor. You shall have it in the morn-&#xD;
ing. Good-night; and God bless you.~~&#xD;
"Stop I stop 1" said Walter. "Not so; I have heard&#xD;
you, now hear me. That I understand-that I honor&#xD;
your generosity, your delicacy, you. must see, you must&#xD;
feel; and, were it necessary, I declare on the faith of a&#xD;
true man, I would not~ refuse you-~would not wound&#xD;
you by ~altry objections to a pecuniary obligation which,&#xD;
&#xD;
1111U&#xD;
&#xD;
H&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
between friends, so far from humbling, elevates, as the&#xD;
expression of that which is far better than money. But&#xD;
the assistance you offer is not required. I have already&#xD;
refused it from my best friend. I can not tell you my&#xD;
reasons. Perhaps pride may have part in them. N~t&#xD;
the pride that shuns an obligation, but the determination&#xD;
to prove that I have in myself the power to conquer my&#xD;
fate, and make my destiny. For this I must act alone.&#xD;
If I felt myself propped, even by the kindest arms, I&#xD;
should be shorn of my strength; I should cease to trust&#xD;
myself; and I should be lo~t! This sounds to you as&#xD;
presumption-perhaps mere fustian. I can not help it,&#xD;
for I can not be more explicit. Accuse my folly and&#xD;
my vain self-reliance-I submit; but do not doubt my&#xD;
affection nor my gratitude. . Take my hand and my&#xD;
heart-give me yours. They are more to me than un~&#xD;
told gold. Oh, Oscar! you can never know how price~&#xD;
less is love tome!"&#xD;
Oscar took the h~ind extended to him, pressed it be'&#xD;
tween his own, and said in a broken voice, "Dear Wal-&#xD;
ter, you distress me. I can not comprehend-I do not&#xD;
judge-I ought not; but one thing I do know: I love&#xD;
and honor you more than ever, though I seem to under-&#xD;
stand you less. I can not press what you in such terms&#xD;
reject. I can but bitterly feel that I can do nothing in&#xD;
myself; no~r for others."&#xD;
Walter cast his- arms around him, pressed him earnest-&#xD;
ly, and said in a tender voice; "Yes, yes, Oscar; you will&#xD;
bless, and be blessed; all I ask is strength to endure."&#xD;
"Qod-night 1" "Good-night !" and they parted--'&#xD;
Osca~ with a promise to see him again before he went.&#xD;
But, instead pf his so doing, Walter, on leaving, his room&#xD;
in the morning, found a note from him,' saying that, be-&#xD;
ing unexpectedly obliged to leave home on business for&#xD;
his father, he could not keep his engagement.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
AT the usual hour Walter was at his post in the li-&#xD;
brary, where, though with frequent interruptions and&#xD;
less ze~d than he could wish, the prescribed routine had&#xD;
been observed. Uncertain if Mr. Meredith had commu-&#xD;
nicated. his intention, and of its reception, he waited in&#xD;
some anxiety. He was not long in doubt. Eleanor en..&#xD;
tered with a troubled face-the hush of fun and frolic&#xD;
all gone.&#xD;
With half.averted eyes, and in a voice low and trem.&#xD;
ulous, she said, "Papa has told me you are going away,&#xD;
Mr. Thornley."&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Eleanor."&#xD;
"And he says you' wish to go; is that so?"&#xD;
" Yes; it is some time, you know, since I left my&#xD;
friends."&#xD;
"Is that your only reason ?" she asked, looking up&#xD;
timidly into his faco.&#xD;
Her embarrassment seemed contagious, for Walter&#xD;
colored and hesitated.&#xD;
"Oh! I see it is as I feared; you are going because&#xD;
you are tired of such ~areless, idle girl~-.a pupil who&#xD;
so ill repays your truffle. It is no wonder you don't&#xD;
wish to teach me; no wonder you are displeased.; I de-&#xD;
serve nothing better."&#xD;
Hastily interrupting her, Walter exclaimed, "Dis-&#xD;
pleased! never! impossible! do not apply such a word&#xD;
to me. Not wish to teach you! it has been the greatest&#xD;
pleasure of my life."&#xD;
His unusual warmth reassured her, and she spoke&#xD;
with, more confidence.&#xD;

Z24         WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
12A&#xD;
&#xD;
"I could not blame you, Mr. Thornley, if it were so.&#xD;
I know I have been negligent of lii~te-why, I can not&#xD;
tell, for I am sure I have never lost the taste you have&#xD;
been at such pains to excite in me. But I have been&#xD;
easily persuaded; the girls were so teasing! And then&#xD;
Mr. Middleton was so kind-so-so--attentive--that-~--"&#xD;
S1~e looked down, colored, and seemed not to know how&#xD;
to proceed.&#xD;
Was it that she felt the poverty of the excuse? or&#xD;
was it a girlish consciousness of a welcome conquest?&#xD;
Walter thought it the last, and, to relieve her embarrass-&#xD;
ment, replied in a calm and encouraging tone:&#xD;
"We will not seek for the cause of what you accuse&#xD;
yourself: a fault felt and acknowledged is in a fair way&#xD;
to be corrected. Let us say no more about it."&#xD;
"Then I feared you would never come back; but you&#xD;
will? You are not cheating us, Mr. Thornley ?"&#xD;
"Cheating you I .how can you imagine it? I would&#xD;
not deceive you for the world."&#xD;
The accustomed smile returned, and she replied, play.&#xD;
fully, "Then I will let you go. It would be selfish to&#xD;
try to keep you longer from your family, when they will&#xD;
be so happy to see you. But you won't forget us, will&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"Family !" thought Walter, while a shade fell on his&#xD;
4&#xD;
face; "where am I to seek for mine ?"&#xD;
"Oh, Mr. Thornley, don't look so! I would not have&#xD;
you too glad togo, but I can not bear to see you sorry.&#xD;
Come! I have something that will please you-a good,&#xD;
really good exercise. I know it must be so, because I&#xD;
have worked with all my heart. I don't mind work&#xD;
now as I used to do. I have not forgotten the answer&#xD;
of Euclid to the Egyptian king, of which you told me-&#xD;
'There us no royal road to ~earning'-.and I have been&#xD;
up this morning studying two hours before breakfast."&#xD;

12&amp;amp;          WALTER TIIORNLEY ; OR,&#xD;
Walter looked pleased and grateful, and rewarded her&#xD;
efforts with the kindest approVal.&#xD;
The lessons over, Eleanor rose to retire, saying, "But&#xD;
you w411 write, Mr. Thornley'-to papa~-or----to maim&#xD;
ma?"&#xD;
"Yes, if they wish it."&#xD;
"And you will send me messages about my studies?&#xD;
I shall not be idle because you are away. And perhaps.&#xD;
mamma will write you what I am doing."&#xD;
"I shall be very happy to hear, Miss Eleanor.&#xD;
~" And you will tell me before you go what I should&#xD;
read ?"&#xD;
"Certainly, if you desire it."&#xD;
Having to make some purchases before leaving the&#xD;
city, Walter in the course of the morning entered a shop&#xD;
in Broadway. While w~ting'the leisure of the shop-&#xD;
man, his attention was attracted to the gentleman he was&#xD;
serving. His air and dress were striking; and, though&#xD;
he spoke English, he was evidently a foreigner.. Just as&#xD;
he had completed his purchase, a carriage stopped at the&#xD;
~door. The shopman, casting a glance toward it, said to&#xD;
a clerk, "There is Mrs. Middleton. She has called for&#xD;
the article she ordered yesterday; hand out the parcel."&#xD;
But the parcel was not made up, and, while the clerk&#xD;
prepared it, Walter, strongly impelled to see her again,&#xD;
went to tlie door. The glass was down, and she was&#xD;
giving directions to the footman. He could not resist&#xD;
the opportunity, and approached, saying, as he present-&#xD;
ed himself; in rather a doubtful tone, "Walter Thornley,&#xD;
madam."&#xD;
Her smile and handimmediately assured him. If his&#xD;
person was not recognized, his name was not forgotten.&#xD;
She was but little changed herself, and compared well&#xD;
with the image in his mind.&#xD;
To her inquiries for Mr~ Grafton succeeded the kind.&#xD;
&#xD;
est expressionS of interest in himself; and pleasure at the&#xD;
renewal, of his intercourse with her son; but, though re&#xD;
getting not seeing him at "the Lodge," Walter remark-&#xD;
ed that the invitation was not repeated.&#xD;
To his inquiry for the health of Mr. Middleton she re-&#xD;
plied with emphasis, "No, he is not well. Our mode ~f&#xD;
life does not suit him. He hates cities and civilization.&#xD;
I hope to induce him the ensuing summer to explore&#xD;
some of the wild parts of the country. These will at&#xD;
least have the charm of novelty."&#xD;
As she spoke, he~ eye, which had wandered from Wal-&#xD;
ter, seemed to encounter something displeasing. He&#xD;
turned to follow its direction, and perceived the gentle-&#xD;
man he had met in the shop at a little distance, with&#xD;
folded arms, and gaze so intently fixed upon her as&#xD;
would easily explain the offended expression of her face.&#xD;
At the same moment, with a wave of her hand to Wal-&#xD;
ter, and drawing up the glass, she reclined on the seat,&#xD;
and the carriage drove off.&#xD;
As he re-entered the shop, he perceived the gentleman&#xD;
standing as if immovable, and when he again came out&#xD;
he was on the same spot, his eyes still following the car-&#xD;
riage, which, having passed round a corner, disappeared.&#xD;
Then, as if mechanically, he joined Walter and walked&#xD;
in silence by his side.&#xD;
For some time neither spoke. At length the gentle-&#xD;
man said, "You know that lady, then ?"&#xD;
"I can claim but a very slight personal acquaintances&#xD;
She is better known to me through my intimacy with&#xD;
her son."&#xD;
"Ah! her son! You know him, too! Is he a youth&#xD;
of any promise ?"&#xD;
The manner of these inquiries betrayed n~ idle curi-&#xD;
osity. It was plain that the speaker had an interest,&#xD;
and a painful one, in the subject, and Walter's sympathy&#xD;
&#xD;

128          WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
.1&#xD;
was excited, lie replied, therefore, earnestly, "Not&#xD;
pro ise,' but performance. lie is manly, gener-&#xD;
ou~ dent, truthful. One of the finest fellows Heav-&#xD;
en ever made! I am proud to call him my friend."&#xD;
As he spoke he was ~struck by the effect his words&#xD;
seemed to produce. The gentleman was unable to re-&#xD;
ply. At length he said, in a voice that betrayed the ef-&#xD;
fort it, cost him, "Ah! indeed! He is not Then like-..&#xD;
his father ?"&#xD;
Whatever might be Walter's distrust of Mr. Middle~&#xD;
ton, lie could not avow it to'~ a stranger; and he merely&#xD;
replied, "I have not seen him since I was a boy, conse-&#xD;
quently have no right to an opinion about him."&#xD;
" But I have !" exclaimed[ the gentleman with a burst&#xD;
of passion. "I have a right both to speak and to do,&#xD;
that but for her should be sealed in the blood of his&#xD;
black and treacherous heart !"&#xD;
Inexpressibly shocked, Walter turned on him a look&#xD;
that recalled him from what was evidently an involun-&#xD;
tary betrayal of his feelings; for, suddenly restraining&#xD;
himself; he said, "Pardon me, sir. The only atone-&#xD;
ment I can offer for thus intruding myself upon you is&#xD;
to say that your honorable testimony to your friend&#xD;
may do him better service than you can possibly corn-&#xD;
prehend. Let me add an earnest request that this acci-&#xD;
dental intervie~W may not be disclosed. Good-morning,"&#xD;
and he hastily retreated, leaving Walter in # state of&#xD;
painful astonishment.&#xD;
116 could not hear unmoved such language applied to&#xD;
Mr.Middleton, of whom he never thought without the&#xD;
same inexplicable interest that he had formerly excited&#xD;
in h~ra-so great that, at times, he could scarce restrain&#xD;
his desire to ask him face to face, "Why he had written&#xD;
that cruel letter?" And then this stranger, who could&#xD;
he be? The deadly foe of the husband, yet the friend&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.           12ff&#xD;
of his wife and son. There was no clue, lie might not,&#xD;
even seek information from Oscar, lest he should violate&#xD;
the injunction imposed on him.'&#xD;
A hasty step approached, and the gentleman was&#xD;
again at his side.&#xD;
"Could you," said he, in an eager, hurried manner,&#xD;
"could you so far oblige me as to obtain for me a sight&#xD;
of your friend without being myself observed ?"&#xD;
While Walter was revolving in his mind how this&#xD;
might be, Oscar being absent, he knew not where nor&#xD;
for how long, the gentleman seemed to recollect himself;&#xD;
and added, "But no, no, 'tis best as it is. Excuse me&#xD;
and, with a quick step, lie was soon out of sight.&#xD;
In the evening, having still some last matters to at-&#xD;
tend to, Walter went out. His own business done, he&#xD;
was on his way to the upper part of the city to deliver&#xD;
a parcel intrusted to him by Mr. Meredith, when the&#xD;
theatre, brilliantly lighted, attracted his attention. It&#xD;
was a benefit night, ~and many were thronging the doors.&#xD;
Like all young persons, Walter was fond of dramatic&#xD;
representations, yet he had been to the theatre but once,&#xD;
resisting both invitations and tickets from Mr. Meredith.&#xD;
On this Qecasion he relented.&#xD;
"If ever so much enchanted to-night," thought he, "I&#xD;
can not be tempted again very soon. I will treat my&#xD;
resolution. It is well, too, just now, to have some mer'&#xD;
rier company than my own thoughts."&#xD;
The rage for the German drama, so great at that time&#xD;
in England, had extended to this country. The New&#xD;
York Theatre was struggling into existence, Cooper&#xD;
then in the ascendant, for whom the managers of New&#xD;
York and Philadelphia were contending, and the popu-&#xD;
lar play of "The Stranger" had saved it; and for this&#xD;
evening another favorite drama of Kotzebue was an-&#xD;
nounced.&#xD;

WALTER TEroRNLEY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Walter, having. found a seat in the pit, looked over&#xD;
the bill that was handed to him..&#xD;
~' Lovers' Vows,'" he repeated. "Not for me; but&#xD;
if I may not have the reality, perhaps I shall enjoy the&#xD;
semblance."&#xD;
The cast of the characters was favorable. Mr. Tyler&#xD;
well supported the Baron, and Cooper was admirable in&#xD;
Frederick. The lovely Miss E. Westray, about whom&#xD;
half the young mini in the city were mad, crowding the&#xD;
lobbies whenever she performed for a passing glance,&#xD;
yet preserving a reputation as fair as her face, appeared&#xD;
as Amelia. Her good taste and dignity gave truth and&#xD;
purity to a part which, if allotted to another, might have&#xD;
been pert and indelicate ; while her grace and na~vet6&#xD;
imparted to ita charm all her own..&#xD;
Walter was soon absorbed in the play. At one mo-&#xD;
ment displeased with Amelia, the next fearing for the&#xD;
virtue of Anlialt; then a momentary pity for the Baron&#xD;
lost in indignant compassion for Agatha; and then for-&#xD;
getting all others in his sympathy with Frederick. All&#xD;
he had ever sns~ected and feared for himself came rush.&#xD;
ing over him.I He listened with the breathless attention&#xD;
that only a personal interest could inspire, till at the&#xD;
words, "I belong to no one! All the world disclaim&#xD;
me!" no loziger master of himself, he 'half rose from his&#xD;
seat, struck his hand to his' forehead, and an indistinct&#xD;
exclamation escaped him. The action drew the atten-&#xD;
tion of the person next him, who inquired if he were ill.&#xD;
Recalled by this, he endeaVored to listen calmly; but&#xD;
when Frederick declares his determination to share the&#xD;
fate of his mother, to know (nly the name that she shall&#xD;
bear~ to be only Friburg or Wildenheim, as she may be&#xD;
~an avowal that called forth a burst of applause-.Wal-&#xD;

Thus moved he was unconscious that he was himself&#xD;

an object of attention. A gentleman, apparently at-&#xD;
tached t6 a party in a box on that side of the house,&#xD;
near which Walter was seated, with a glass directed to-&#xD;
ward him, kept him constantly in sight. When the&#xD;
curtain fell at the conclusion of the play, he rose, and,&#xD;
after another scrutinizing survey of Walter, left the box.&#xD;
Others also went out, as usual, while some rose and look-&#xD;
ed about them; but Walter sat still, his mind divided&#xD;
between the interests of the play and his own.&#xD;
The signal of recall was given. People resumed their&#xD;
seats, and among them the gentleman before mentioned.&#xD;
If Walter had been at the moment observant of any&#xD;
thing external, he might have seen him speaking to a&#xD;
man in the shadow of the box near the door, to whom,&#xD;
at the sam time, with a slight movement of his hand,&#xD;
he indic alter. The man retreated, and the gen-&#xD;
tleman seated himself but it was plain that the stage in-&#xD;
terested him lss than the young man in the pit.&#xD;
The entertainmentt" .was the favorite after-piece of&#xD;
the "Spoiled Child." The tricks and songs of little&#xD;
Pickle received their accustomed applause, but more&#xD;
than usual effect. and importance were given to the part&#xD;
of Tag by the performance of Jefferson. Ahi who can&#xD;
ever forget him, who was fortunate enough to see him&#xD;
in those more worthy of his powers? in Goldfinch, the&#xD;
incomparable Scaramouch, or the&#xD;
"Father-in-law&#xD;
To a very magnificent three-tailed bashaw ?"  -&#xD;
The curtain finally fallen, and the people pouring out,&#xD;
Walter found himself in a crowded, passage; where a&#xD;
person wrapped in a large cloak, and guarding himself&#xD;
from the rush of night air by drawing it over his face so&#xD;
as nearly to cover it, jostled him in the attempt to&#xD;
pass. As Walter turned to resist the rudenes; he saw&#xD;
him already some steps ahead, but looking at him ~over&#xD;

A PEEP AT TflE~ PAST.          133&#xD;
&#xD;
~1ais shoulders in a manner rather inconsistent with his&#xD;
apparent haste.&#xD;
~9nce clear of the house, he thought no more of it.&#xD;
Qppressed with the close atmosphere of the theatre, he&#xD;
prolonged his walk beyond it, and soon outstripped the&#xD;
few who were proceeding in that direction. After a&#xD;
~while there was. only the echo of his own feet, when at&#xD;
length ~hearing. a solitary step behind, returned, and saw&#xD;
a person following at a short distance. At first he re-&#xD;
~garded it as accidental; but finding that when he had&#xD;
pc~asion to cross the street the 'man did so too, and that&#xD;
when he recrossed it by way of trial the man did the&#xD;
~axxiie, he stQpped.&#xD;
Being naturally impatient of impertinence, and, more-&#xD;
over,~ stout-hearted, he turned upon the man, now just&#xD;
behind him,, and said, in a tone of authority, "Proceed;&#xD;
sir! I do not choose to be dogged."&#xD;
The man passed without speaking, and, quickening&#xD;
his pacey was soon out of sight. Walter observed that&#xD;
he was shorter than the person who had passed him in&#xD;
the lobby, whose manner had somewhat struck him, and&#xD;
that he were no cloak. He looked at his watch; it was&#xD;
later than he had supposed, and he retraced his steps&#xD;
toward Jiogie.&#xD;
'Phe moon was up and bright, but soon a rack of dark&#xD;
clouds drifted across and completely obscured her. Ev-&#xD;
ery object had thus been cast in deep shadow for a time,&#xD;
when, suddenly emerging, she revealed the same man on&#xD;
a line with Walter, and but a few paces from him.&#xD;
Raising a pretty formidable cane, which he was in the&#xD;
habit of using at night, Walter advanced a step toward&#xD;
the man, and ~aid, "Begone this instant, or IL level you&#xD;
tQ the ground!"&#xD;
It was plainly no idle threat; and he retreated hastily&#xD;
down a street, the corner of which they were just passing.&#xD;
&#xD;
A short talk brought Walter to the house at which&#xD;
he was to leave Mr. Meredith's papers. After ascending&#xD;
a flight of steps, ringing the bell, and delivering the par-&#xD;
cel, he was about to descend when near the foot he again&#xD;
saw the same person. At the moment a watchman ap-&#xD;
proacheci from the other side ofthe street.&#xD;
Walter raised his voice. "Arrest that man," said he;&#xD;
"he is about no good." But, taking to his heels, the in-&#xD;
truder was gone, and Walter reached Mr. Meredith's door&#xD;
without farther molestation.&#xD;
Conceiving it a plan to rob him, which, being frus-&#xD;
trated, was of no consequence, he did not mention the&#xD;
circumstance to his friends, but gave the little time that&#xD;
now remained to what interested him wore.&#xD;
At length, with an effort delayed to~t~ last moment,&#xD;
he bade them farewell in anticipation~ of his early morn-&#xD;
ing departure.&#xD;
Walter's return brought sunshine to Ashton. But&#xD;
while Mr. ~-rafton found much to repay the pain of sep-&#xD;
aration' in the development the natural result of more&#xD;
varied observation, IDamie'~ scrutiny and approval were&#xD;
directed to somewhat different things.&#xD;
"Well, I declare !" said she, smoothing. down his&#xD;
sleeve, "if you haven't worn this 'ere coat car'f'ully;&#xD;
why, it's pretty nigh as new as when you went away."&#xD;
"I have not had much occasion for it," said Walter.&#xD;
"Why, it was your best; you couldn't help wearing'&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Yes, Damie, till Ii got a better, of which, I dare say,&#xD;
you will approve," he added, with a smile.&#xD;
It was a presumptuous conclusion. She only opei~ied&#xD;
wide her eyes at what she deemed the superfluities of&#xD;
his wardrobe; for Damie, like other womankind over-&#xD;
awed by boys just fledged, knew how to wonder in si-&#xD;
lence, inly resolving, however, that "every individival&#xD;

went back; so he needn't have no excuse to buy more."&#xD;
Among others, his old friend Jed lost no time in' com-&#xD;
ing to congratulate him on his return.&#xD;
"I'm as glad to see you, Walter, as ever I was to see&#xD;
pay-day I What a stout lad you're grown I' And you'll&#xD;
not be too proud to fish and shoot with old Jed, because&#xD;
you've been among the quality, will you ?"&#xD;
Walter gave the desired assurance, amused at his ex-&#xD;
aggerated idea Qf the honor that had been "thrust upon"&#xD;
him by the "quality."&#xD;
Happy to be again among his early friends, he betook&#xD;
himself to aU his old ways, much to the satisfaction of&#xD;
Damie.&#xD;
"He's not a speck spilled " thought she; "just as nat-&#xD;

Walter had been at. home' nearly a month when a let-&#xD;

been left there by ~a person who' passed directly on, and&#xD;
W~ insenbed "wit1~. oare a~id speed"-a request enforced&#xD;
in this instance, probablyiby~ a '~ consideration," as it had&#xD;
only, been left the precedix~g day. Walter opened it,&#xD;
and reed as follows:&#xD;
"You have disregarded my commands. Be thankful&#xD;
that you have escaped the penalty 'you deserve and&#xD;
might have inci~rred.&#xD;
"Remain where ~done you. are safe, and do not farther&#xD;
tempt the consequences of my just displeasure by your&#xD;
disobedisn.c&amp;amp;'&#xD;
Without date, place, or signature, there was still no&#xD;
difficulty in ascertaining the writer.&#xD;

"Why should he not have sent it by mail ?" said&#xD;
Walter; "it might have never reached me."&#xD;
"Probably because he could not evade a post-mark.&#xD;
He has evidently strong reasons for what he does, since&#xD;
he avoids the most obvious course."&#xD;
Walter reflected, and recalling his being dogged the&#xD;
evening before leaving the city, he mentioned it. "It&#xD;
might have been some creature of his, instructed to as-&#xD;
certain my place of abode, in. which, however, he failed.&#xD;
Himself it was not. Height and person were altogether&#xD;
different. But, having discovered my 'disobedience,'&#xD;
as he presumes to call it, why wait a' month before&#xD;
writing ?"&#xD;
"In the dark as we are, an atten~t to account for his&#xD;
actions is vain. Besides, you can neither tell when the&#xD;
letter was written,' nor at what distance."&#xD;
"That is true. However, it matters little to me; I&#xD;
shall 'proceed as I have begun."&#xD;
"Walter," said Mr. Grafton, "you are young and fear~&#xD;
less-'--perhaps because older, I am more timid. Do not&#xD;
too far oppose this man. This late attempt at New York,&#xD;
I confess, increases my anxiety-abortive though it&#xD;
proved. It indicates a pert~nacity of purpose that is not&#xD;
to be foiled; perhaps a power to injure if not to benefit.&#xD;
Do not be rash."&#xD;
"My dear sir,~ am not rash. Believe me, my reso-&#xD;
lution has been formed deliberately, I may almost say&#xD;
religiously. If any thing in. him inspired confidence I&#xD;
could submit. It would surely be no hard matter to re-&#xD;
main with ~,'ou. ]3ut,'with the feeling he has excited in&#xD;
me, to leave myself a mere puppet in hjgi hands would&#xD;
have the worst possible effect on me.' I should become&#xD;
useless, irritable, morbid. I dare not expose myself to&#xD;
such a trial. No. There ma~r, indeed, be consequences&#xD;

W4LTER ~TROR~LEY; OR,&#xD;
not less terrible to me, which T can clearly discern in the&#xD;
strange, the aimless existence to which he would con-&#xD;
de~in me. Look at his letters; see the style in which&#xD;
he addresses me-at two-and-twenty the same as at fif-&#xD;
teen !-a mere string of threats and mysterious warnings.&#xD;
His object, to frighten me to his purpose. That of it-&#xD;
self, ~tside. from his violated engagements, is enough to&#xD;
justify distrust."&#xD;
"But you know, Walter," said Mr. Grafton, hesitating-&#xD;
ly, "yow know-you can not-can not understand the&#xD;
extent of the claim he may have upon you.~'&#xD;
"Oh, do no1~. my dear sir," exclaimed Walter, start-&#xD;
iiig up, and pacing the floor, ~ do not speak thus! Any&#xD;
tbhig else! It is the only thing I ~an not bear. I must&#xD;
forget it-it drives rue nearly mad Vo.think of it." Then,&#xD;
recovering himself, and taking affectionately Mr. Graf-&#xD;
ton's band, he added, "Forgive me. I ought never' to&#xD;
disturb you by such violence. Forgive me, and I will&#xD;
not again offend you by it." ~&#xD;
A letter from Oscar gave another direction to his&#xD;
thoughts. It was, as usual, kind and cheerful, but, to&#xD;
Walter's surprise , dated from Charleston, to which place&#xD;
it was evident that he had been hurried, without return-&#xD;
ing to New York, There, he said, his parents had now&#xD;
joined him. Their future was uncertain; but his father&#xD;
talked of wild exploratiQns, that might keep them even&#xD;
tlienext winter at the South.&#xD;
These rather obscure intimations furnished. matter of&#xD;
reflection. Walter remembered the stranger he had&#xD;
met in New York, and his hostility to Mr. Middleton.&#xD;
"Could this abrupt desertion of their hon~e be connected&#xD;
with that perso:a ?"&#xD;

THERE was little occasion to impose on Eleanor a&#xD;
more moderate participation Qf pleasure.. Indifferent&#xD;
now to other things, her chief enjoyment w~s in pursu-&#xD;
ing the course of reading that Walter had recommended&#xD;
at parting. But the life-giving spirit was gone; though&#xD;
she persevered, it was not with her usual, animation, andy&#xD;
to add to the shade that was falling on her, lier agree-&#xD;
able young admirer, Oscar, was gone too-even sooner&#xD;
than had been expected. She and her mother were&#xD;
passing a quiet evening at home, the latter weaving&#xD;
fringe, the former weaving fancies, when Mr7Meredith&#xD;
entered with a look of having something pleasant to say.&#xD;
"I have made a new acquaintance, my dear," said he,&#xD;
addressing his wife; "one whom I think you would like&#xD;
as much as I do."&#xD;
"That is very probable," she replied, with her usual&#xD;
gentle conformity. "You know that, like Mrs. Smith,&#xD;
who does not venture to commend the weather without&#xD;
adding, 'Mr. Smith thinks so too,' I always agree with&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"No, not always; I ~hould not love you so well if&#xD;
you did, I like, sometimes, a little ~of the 'Lawrence&#xD;
spirit;' it keeps domestic life from stagnation."&#xD;
"Well, well, but the gentleman, who is he ?"&#xD;
"Captain Talbot. He dined with me to-day, at Mr.&#xD;
Ogden's. He was the life of the company,' intelligent,&#xD;
full of anecdote, and fine manners. A really well-bred&#xD;
man; for an accomplished, traveled Englishman is the&#xD;
best sample of gentleman to b~ found, the world over."&#xD;
"A military men, of course ?"&#xD;

i~8          WALTER ~rHOnNLEV; OR,&#xD;
"He has been: hut II understand he sold his commit.&#xD;
si~i some years since. He has seen service, however;&#xD;
has a fine military air, and is about six or eight~.and-&#xD;
thirty, though he looks older-the effect of his profes-&#xD;
sion, 12 suppose. Ogden says he is not rich, he thinks,&#xD;
but very 'well connected. He is acquainted with the&#xD;
Middletons, and has been in this country more than&#xD;
once before."&#xD;
* "Shall you see -him again?"&#xD;
"Oh yes; I shall call on him to-morrow, and ask him&#xD;
to dinner, at your earliest convenience."&#xD;
So said, so done; and at the' day appointed Captain&#xD;
Talbot appeared.&#xD;
Mr. Meredith had not exaggerated; lie was indeed&#xD;
little prone to do so. The guests were well selected, and&#xD;
the captain recommended himself to all. His appear-&#xD;
ance, on which Mr. Meredith had not enlarged, assia~ed&#xD;
to this effect. He certainly-looked old for his years, but&#xD;
his brilliant eyes-the keenness of which was tempered&#xD;
by a most effective smile, his fine teeth, dark hair-thin,&#xD;
but only slightly changed, his figure and air, presented&#xD;
a whole that most persons would have pronounced still&#xD;
handsome.&#xD;
Eleanor, sufficiently grown to be regarded as a young&#xD;
lady, retained her girlish simplicity of dress and manner.&#xD;
Her open frock was exchanged for a gown of fine cam-&#xD;
bric; its surplice folds, so disposed as to show to ad-&#xD;
vantage her form, were confined at the waist by ~ girdle,&#xD;
and its tight long sleeves fitted perfectly her well-roi~pid-&#xD;
ed arn~.'. Her hair, still allowed to-be uncontrolled, fell&#xD;
behind, in its naturall wavy lines, to her waist, 'and on'&#xD;
her forehead and cheek lay in small loose ringlets. Ear-&#xD;
rings, simple gold hoops of mq~4ierate size, and a brooch&#xD;
were her only ornaments,.&#xD;
Oaptaiu Talbot was seated at Mrs.. Meredith's right&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP-AT TIlE FASTS          I3~&#xD;
hand, and Eleanor next him. They had thus the bene-&#xD;
fit. of all his pleasantries, whether addressed to them-&#xD;
selves or to others; while his deferential manner toward&#xD;
the mother was nicely graduated into a shade of kind-&#xD;
ness toward the' daughter~ well understandin~ from her&#xD;
youth and shyness 'that she was as yet unaccustomed to&#xD;
take a part on such occasions. "Youth and shyness,"&#xD;
at that day, were considered properly inseparable; for&#xD;
there were then American girls who did not talk loud,&#xD;
speak fa~t, laugh immoderately, nor pronounce confi-&#xD;
dently-who did not distort their fine native language&#xD;
by "slang," nor by misapplication. Of many things&#xD;
now known it must be admitted they were ignorant;&#xD;
but they did know that a volcano was not "nice, a&#xD;
murder not "fi~nny ;" that commonplace sensations were&#xD;
not "intense;" that mice and kittens were not "awful;"&#xD;
that caps and ribbons were not "loves ;" and that "glo-&#xD;
rious," "splendid," a "jolly," were not convertible&#xD;
terms.&#xD;
"But surely there are just such girls now," objects&#xD;
some young lady reader. "I know many such; there&#xD;
'1&#xD;
is Miss do-, and So-, and So-.&#xD;
Granted, fair critic! There are charming exceptions7&#xD;
and you, ~indoubtedly, among the number. But they&#xD;
only serve to illustrate the too common rule.&#xD;
On this subject, however, you will not be easily con-&#xD;
vinced, so we will return to the dinner-table, where ti~4&#xD;
captain confirmed the agreeable impression he had ~&#xD;
ready made.&#xD;
The liking expressed by Mr. Mei~dith appeared to be&#xD;
mutual, as was proved by an early call from Captain&#xD;
Talbot, longer than ceremony required. From this aus-&#xD;
picious commencement, the intercourse ripened so fast&#xD;
that he was soon an ha bit w~ of the house.&#xD;

140         WALTER THOR~LEY; OR,&#xD;
ueeted with the best colonial aristocracy, had imbibed&#xD;
with prejudices of birth strong English partialities.&#xD;
Though early involved iii measures tending to revolu-&#xD;
tion, aud a consistent adherent to the interests of the&#xD;
Colonies, lie had been slow to believe in the possibility&#xD;
or expedien~y of their independence. But," yielding at&#xD;
length. to the pressure of the time, he had sincerely co-&#xD;
operated toward such a result. Once obtained, however,&#xD;
lie ardently desired to maintain friendly relations with&#xD;
the parent country. At the origin of the parties which,&#xD;
soon after the peace, had divided the public mind, he had&#xD;
naturally adhered to the most conservative, and fell, like K&#xD;
others, under the imputation of British influence. The&#xD;
excesses of the French Revolution, excused by those&#xD;
who remembered only their ancient ally, confirmed him&#xD;
in these opinions. France ~and England became the&#xD;
watch-words of party, and a rancorous feeling was ex-&#xD;
hibited that threatened serious evils. Under "Federal"&#xD;
and "Anti-FederaP' were ranged good and wise men on&#xD;
either side' and, as must always be the case, the selfish&#xD;
and unprincipled were also found in both ranks. The&#xD;
press fomented the passions thus engendered, and per-&#xD;
sonal abuse knew no restraint; so that even the founder&#xD;
of the Republic was movedfto say, that "every act of his&#xD;
administration had been tortured; and that, too, in such&#xD;
e~aggeratq4 and indecent terms as could. scarcely be ap-&#xD;
plied to a Nero7 to a notorious defaulter, or even to a coni-&#xD;
mon pickpocket.".. At this moment; however, wheii ac~~&#xD;
cumulated injuries seemed to have reached their height,&#xD;
when the arrogance and' lawless attempts of Gene~t, the&#xD;
px~tensions~ of F~auchet and Adet, the insulting tone 'as-&#xD;
sumed' by the French Directory, the insolent dismissal&#xD;
bf our minister and commissioners, threatened to involve&#xD;
us in a war with France, a better and more national&#xD;
spirit appeared. A common feeling of injury awaken-&#xD;

ed a conviction of common interest and mutual depend-&#xD;
ence.&#xD;
I3ut Mr. Meredith was. little encouraged by the lull of&#xD;
party storm. He saw in. these fearful outbreaks indica-&#xD;
tions of disunion and anarchy; and, invited by the sym-&#xD;
pathizing tone of his new friend,' perhaps, alas! who hu~&#xD;
not a weak side ?-perhaps not insensible to the well-&#xD;
timed regrets of Captain Talbot tbat such men as he&#xD;
should not be placed where patriotism and talent could&#xD;
have their effect, gave vent to his occasional despond-&#xD;
ency.&#xD;
The captain was remarkably free from the assump-~&#xD;
tion ascribed to his countrymen, nor had he any of the&#xD;
sore filing which so recent a conflict might well excite.&#xD;
On the contrary, \he contemplated' the matter from an&#xD;
impartial position. "He rejoiced in the independence&#xD;
of America. It was best for both countries. He con-&#xD;
gratulated himself t1~at he had not been, compelled to&#xD;
draw his sword in a cause of which he could not ap-&#xD;
prove."&#xD;
"But, my dear sir," continued he, "why thus disturb&#xD;
yourself? No man more rejoices in the prospects of&#xD;
your country than myself; but look at the history of&#xD;
republics; where have they endured? And ~where is&#xD;
the charter which insures to America a longer duration?&#xD;
Be satisfied, then; she will ascend like Atliens-like&#xD;

rope-seller, Oleon the leather-seller, Lysicles the sheep-&#xD;
seller, Hyperbolus the lamp.maker, and so on; till mis-&#xD;
rule shall subside under "the strong arm of some vulgar&#xD;
demagogue or military chief."&#xD;
"And you counsel me to be satisfied withtliis ?" ex-&#xD;
claimed Mr. Meredith.&#xD;
"Yes; because you can have nothing better. But it&#xD;

may- be long before such a termination. Long before&#xD;
your young 'Demos' comes to his full maturity, and&#xD;
k~nger still before he becomes the 'Old Demos' of the&#xD;
Athenian stage-flattered, cajoled, and impoverished by&#xD;
some artful idol of the day. In the mean time genera-&#xD;
tions will have passed; America will have taken her&#xD;
place among the nations and on the page of history,&#xD;
whieh will record her rise and her fall. No, no, my dear&#xD;
sir, you and your political friends are. more rational and&#xD;
practical than your opponents, but even you can not&#xD;
work impossibilities. You can not save mankind against&#xD;
their will.' Be wise, then;' enjoy the present. Indif-&#xD;
ference is the only philosophy for the future."&#xD;
"No," said Mr. Meredith; warmly; "despondent I&#xD;
may sometimes be-indifferent I can never be. My&#xD;
prevailing trust is in the good sense of which I believe&#xD;
the people . to be capable, ithat .they will finally work&#xD;
themselves clear of the mists which now obscure them.&#xD;
All I contend for is that, while being educated for lib-&#xD;
erty, they should be under competent guardians. '- If I&#xD;
thought as badly. of the race as you do, Captain Talbot, I&#xD;
should not much care to remain in a world subject to it?'&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith and Eleanor often 'present at these dis-&#xD;
cussions, were not uninterested hearers; tEe former in.&#xD;
dictating by a word or a look her accordance with her&#xD;
husband's views, and Eleanor silent,- but wondering that&#xD;
"so a~niable a person as Captain Talbot should think other&#xD;
people so bad." At another time, when the subject of&#xD;
imported luxuries, fashions, and vices' was under consid-&#xD;
eration,' after rallying what he called the causeless alarm&#xD;
of Mr. Meredith, the captain, with a careless laugh, con-&#xD;
eluded; "Well, then, the only consolation that rexnains&#xD;
for you, sir, is the 'Fable of the Bees.' - You know the&#xD;
moral-' Private vices, public benefits.' For my part,&#xD;
pending to no 'political science, I leave the' problem&#xD;

apply Kepler's law to planetary motions. I am but a&#xD;

a soldier, I do as II am ordered, and leave co~isequen~es&#xD;
to others. It is with you, sir, and such as y&amp;amp;i~-men of&#xD;
wisdom, talents, and influence-that responsibilityrests."&#xD;
Thus,~ often agreeing with Mr. Meredith, or differing&#xD;
but to give spirit to the conversation, with just such a&#xD;
dash of compliment as served to combine and harmonize&#xD;
the whole, it was not surprising that Captain Talbot.&#xD;
should be an acceptable :visitor, and that certain gleams&#xD;
of a cold and selfish philosophy should be, unobserved;&#xD;
or excused, as the effect of 'a profession ~which led him&#xD;
to regard men as machines or slaves-alike drilled,&#xD;
whether for a battle or an election-and equally led&#xD;
blindly, whether it were by a superior, or by their pas~&#xD;
sions.&#xD;
This familiar intercourse soon became intimacy. Cap:&#xD;
tam Talbot seemed by an instinct to adapt himself to all&#xD;
-to Mrs. Meredith by' donations to her favorite chari-&#xD;
ties, 'and to Eleanor by a happy mixture of encourage-&#xD;
ment and respect, inspiring her with an ease and freedom&#xD;
she had never felt toward any other visitor.&#xD;
A itioney transaction of small amount; but serving to&#xD;
exhibit the captain under another phase, confirmed his'&#xD;
good standing. 'Certain English remittances expected'&#xD;
by him not arriving, he requested of Mr. Meredith a loan&#xD;
of a few hundred pounds. It was readily advanced,&#xD;
and a promise given of early repayment. Before the&#xD;
time, the money was returned in a draft on one of the-&#xD;
best New York houses. Mr. Meredith presented it him.&#xD;
self; not sorry to have an opportunity 'of thus obtaining&#xD;
farther indirect testimony to his new friend. He was&#xD;
not disappointed. The draft was accepted without hes-&#xD;

itation, and the merchant~ proceeded to say, "he knew&#xD;
nothing Qf Captain Talbot except in the way of business,&#xD;
~but he had had frequent exchanges to negotiate for him&#xD;
and hisfriends, and. that every thing had been perfectly&#xD;
satisfactory." -&#xD;
The time for retiring to the country arrived~ This,&#xD;
instead of interposing an obstacle to the intercourse, only&#xD;
gave it a more familiar~character, the captain often pass-&#xD;
ing aft unceremonious day at "The Oaks," and not un-&#xD;
frequently remaining the night-becoming, in' sh*t,&#xD;
"l'a~mi de Ia rnaisor&amp;amp;."&#xD;
One evening Mr. Meredith, on returning from the city,&#xD;
had that~air which experienced wives know to indicate&#xD;
something on the minds of their lords paramount, and,&#xD;
with the tact of the sex, without any direct inquiry, p~'e-&#xD;
pared the way for its disclosure, were he so disposed, by&#xD;
an early removal of the tea obstructions, and then by&#xD;
suggesting some employment that should take Eleanor&#xD;
from the parlor; Then, seating herself at her work, she&#xD;
waited till Mr. Meredith should open' his budget for their&#xD;
mutual relief. She had not long to wait.&#xD;
"My dear," said he, "I have a matter to submit to&#xD;
you. Captain Taibot has proposed f6r Eleanor."&#xD;
With unaffected astonishment Mrs. Meredith dropped&#xD;
her sewing and looked at her husband. "For Eleanor!&#xD;
Eleanor! Well, that can not require long deliberation."&#xD;
"Do yom mean by that, approval or the contrary ?"&#xD;
"The contrary, of course. Why, Mr. Meredith, Elea-&#xD;
nor is a child! and he' is more than double her age."&#xD;
"Very true; that is precisely the dimculty. Aside&#xD;
from that, I could see advantages in the connection not&#xD;
.to be disregarded."&#xD;
"Advantages !"&#xD;
"Yes. To be sure he' is not rich. lie has dealt very'&#xD;
frankly with me. lie is within one life of a large estate;&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
*1&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.           145&#xD;
&#xD;
but that life, as he' says, is as good, or better, than his&#xD;
own. This, howeVer, matters little. Eleanor's lai~ge leg.&#xD;
acy from your aunt, to be hers at eighteen, or earlier, if&#xD;
she marry before, would be a reasonable independence.&#xD;
lie is well born-a great consideration-land well edu-&#xD;
cated; can furnish the best credentials as to characir~r&#xD;
andposition; is a man of sense and honor-a better guar-&#xD;
antee for her happiness, and for her character ~yet un-&#xD;
formed, than if he were a yo~ing man as immature as&#xD;
herself.".&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith listened, but, unconvinced ret&#xD;
her first objection.                      urnec~ to&#xD;
'KBut, my dear, she is a child! a perfect child! her ed-&#xD;
ucation not yet completed."&#xD;
"True again; but lie could therefore better train her&#xD;
to conformity, and, of course, to sympathy."&#xD;
"That means that his powerful will and stronger qual-&#xD;
ities would crush every thing individual out of her. I&#xD;
do not call that 'sympathy,' and the process is any thing&#xD;
but 'happiness."'&#xD;
"Well, well, do not be disturbed. I have given him&#xD;
to understand the case just as it stands; that if he were&#xD;
ten years younger, or she as much older, I should not&#xD;
object; but that, as it is, I can not approve.&#xD;
"Then it is settled, is it not ?"&#xD;
"Not quite. He still asks to be allowed to refer the&#xD;
matter to hemelf; this is the point for us to decide. For&#xD;
i~iyself; I do not see that we can deny him so small a&#xD;
favor as a refusal from her own lips."&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith, with her direct common 'sense, had,&#xD;
woman-like, jumped to a conclusion, and not far from&#xD;
right. She saw that the captain's conversation, his hian-&#xD;
ners, his flattering estimation of Mr. Meredith-obvious,&#xD;
however delicately insinuated-~.did not permit to that&#xD;
gentleman the free use of his usually sound judgment.&#xD;

&#xD;
She saw, too, that the captain, relying on the friendly&#xD;
feeling he had inspired in the young lady, was confident&#xD;
'of his own powers of persuasion; nor could she tell how&#xD;
far the silly fancy of "being her own mistress" might&#xD;
aid him. She had: not forgotten that the pretty daughter&#xD;
of a friend of hers had married at sixteen a baronet of&#xD;
sixty, for the bribe of going to England, and being called&#xD;
"my lady." For her own part, "she liked the captain&#xD;
very well-liked to hear him talk to Mr. Meredith-but&#xD;
didn't care for a nearer connection." So she sat silent&#xD;
and perplexed.&#xD;
"Well, my dear," said her husband," shall lie be per-&#xD;
mitted to make his application ?"&#xD;
"And yow-you will not suggest any thing in his fa-&#xD;
vor?"&#xD;
"No, certainly not; nor you any thing to his pr~ejm&#xD;
di~e, I hope; fci'r I conceive it a point of honor to let~ the&#xD;
captain have a fair field."&#xD;
With this non-interference Mrs. Meredith felt it nec-&#xD;
essary to acquiesce, and she tried to wait patiently the&#xD;
i'esult,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
THE next morning the all-unconscious Eleanor; put-&#xD;
ting on her straw "scoop" a name given to a bonnet&#xD;
Thore useful than comtAy-and with basket and scissors,&#xD;
prepared for her accustomed business of gathering flow-&#xD;
ers for the parlor decoration, descended into the garden,&#xD;
followed by her inseparable attendant, Bruno. Her&#xD;
basket was soon filled, but the morning was so beaufi-&#xD;
ful she could not think of returning to the house; so&#xD;
she placed it, as she supposed, in security under a rose-&#xD;
bush, and wandered off to the trees that skirted the&#xD;
garden.&#xD;
Bruno, with the propensity of some bipeds to find&#xD;
what is not lost, took it into his head to carry the bask-&#xD;
et after her, as he had sometimes been directed to do.&#xD;
Her first intimation of this officiousness was the flowers&#xD;
scattered to right and left, and the empty basket in his&#xD;
mouth. Catching up a twig she was about to chastise&#xD;
him, but this only provoked him to retain his prize, and&#xD;
a contest ensued, in which, getting the better, he made&#xD;
off with his booty. Then, after many feints and circuits,&#xD;
he brought it back, and laid it and himself at her feet.&#xD;
At this moment the captain, having called, and being&#xD;
told where to 'seek her; appeared. Exercise and frolic&#xD;
had heightened her color and excited her spirits. She&#xD;
was in the gayest humor: ripe for fun and sport.&#xD;
"See !" she cried, "how reVerently he has prostrated&#xD;
himself before me! The cunning ~fellow !"&#xD;
"And who would not do so !" returned the captain,&#xD;
warmed into an excess of admiration as he gazed at her.&#xD;
Otherwise occupied, Eleanor did not observe the corn-&#xD;

&#xD;
pliment conveyed; and the dog, as merry as herself;&#xD;
keeping his paw ~n the basket, the instant she extended&#xD;
ker hand to recover it, caught it up, ready for another&#xD;
chase, while she, stamping her foot, exclaimed, authori-&#xD;
tatively, "Let go, sir! Have done, sir! this moment 1"&#xD;
But in vain; he was off; and she on the point of fol-&#xD;
lowing him, when the captain, seizing her hand, de-&#xD;
tamed her while he poured forth a passionate declaration.&#xD;
of kve.&#xD;
Eleanor stood in mtrte amazement. She compre-&#xD;
hended' that an answer was expected, but what must it&#xD;
be? She understood that something was to be said to&#xD;
save the captain from "dying in despair I" something&#xD;
"to breathe into him a hope that would render life en-&#xD;
durable;" that would hold out a prospect of "ineffable&#xD;
felicity ;" but she could not say it. On the other hand,&#xD;
how could she be "cruel, inexorable, inflexible," as he&#xD;
said, to so kind a person?&#xD;
Encouraged by her silence, more and warmer prote4-&#xD;
ations assailed her.&#xD;
Could he have looked within the deep recess of 'the&#xD;
protecting "scoop," so inclined that his eager glance&#xD;
could not penetrate it, he might have augured different-&#xD;
ly-- Surprise, perplexity, alarm, were passing over her&#xD;
face, but nO gentle yielding. Rather through all was to&#xD;
be discovered a sense of the ridiculous, equally unfriend-&#xD;
ly to his suit. At length, finding words, she exclaimed,&#xD;
"Oh, don't say so! pray don't 1" words met by reiter-&#xD;
ated vows' of devotion and deprecations of her cruelty.&#xD;
Overpowered by his ardent volubility, and anxious to&#xD;
put the readiest termination to what, distressed as she&#xD;
was, struck her as excessively absurd she could think&#xD;
only of the stratagem by, which yoting ladies hold them*,&#xD;
selves at liberty to evade a partner in a less momentous&#xD;
enterprise, ~and she impulsively exclaimed, "Oh, 'Cap-&#xD;
&#xD;
tam Talbot, you must not talk so! Indeed I am not&#xD;
cruel! But I can iiot-I[ really can not-Iam enga1yed/"&#xD;
The captain dropped~ier hand as if he had been shot,&#xD;
and she, delighted to be saved any farther parley, fled.&#xD;
"Engaged! engaged!" repeated the discomfited lover.&#xD;
"Ho~r can it be! Who can have rifled this lovely young&#xD;
creature from me!"'&#xD;
Then, revolving every one he had met at the house,&#xD;
and finding none on whom his suspicion could fasten,&#xD;
he again exclaimed, "It can not ;be4t is impossible!&#xD;
But she might have met the favored individual else-&#xD;
where; must have done so, since it was plain her family&#xD;
was ignorant of the matter."&#xD;
Pacing to and fro till conjecture was exhausted, he at&#xD;
length turned his steps to the house to seek her parents,&#xD;
to communicate his failure and the cause, to deplore his&#xD;
fate, and. to withdraw. Their consternation far exceed-&#xD;
ed his own. The feelings that had so lately disturbed&#xD;
them-Mr. Meredith's sympathy for his friend, Mrs. Mer-&#xD;
edith's fears for her daughter.-were forgotten in other&#xD;
and stronger emotions. The father was indignant at her&#xD;
dupli&amp;amp;~ty; the mother gri6ved at the want of confidence&#xD;
in her child; and both were terrified by the fearful ques-&#xD;
tion of "to whom had she pledged herself?" The on~ly&#xD;
plausible idea was young Middleton. This was far from&#xD;
satisfactory; he was as much too young as the captain&#xD;
was too old. A mere boy, and, a~ Mr. Meredith consid~&#xD;
ered, characterless and unreliable. But it might be much&#xD;
worse; after such deception what might they not fear?&#xD;
The first thing to be done was to obtain a full confes-&#xD;
sion from Eleanor herself. Here a difficulty arose as to&#xD;
which should require it of her. Mrs. Meredith, i~now-&#xD;
ing the awe in which she stood of her father, feared his&#xD;
severity would overwhelm her; while he, on his part;&#xD;
saw that her mother's gentleness would be farther im-&#xD;

150        WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;

posed on by Eleanor. It was at length decided that&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith was the more proper of the two, and she&#xD;
*as about to leave the room for the pui'pose, with a&#xD;
dread of what might ensue, when the door opened and&#xD;
Walter Thornley entered. It was the time that had&#xD;
been appointed for his return, but, having written to ob-&#xD;
tain a longer leave of absence, he was not expected.&#xD;
Sensible people sometimes do foolish things. So Mr.&#xD;
and Mrs. Meredith, mutually distrustful, gladly caught,&#xD;
in their perplexity, at a third person to act for them,&#xD;
whose positioned discretion seemed at the moment to&#xD;
settle the question of his fitness.&#xD;
"Oh, Mr. Thornley," they both exclaimed, "how glad&#xD;
we are to see you! You are the very person we want."&#xD;
Walter, his face flushed with pleasure at the sight of&#xD;
his friends, his eager~ eye seeking his absent pupil, re-&#xD;
sponded gratefully to a reception warmer than he ex-&#xD;
pected.&#xD;
"The illness of a friend I feared would detain me,"&#xD;
said Walter; "but, happily, I could leave him, and be&#xD;
here as I had promised. I hope Miss Eleanor is well?"&#xD;
After what seemed rather a cold reply on their part,&#xD;
he inquired in what way his services were required.&#xD;
This necessarily introduced the subject in hand, and, re-&#xD;
questing him to be seated, Mr. Meredith, with profes-&#xD;
sional accuracy, stated the case, beginning at the begin-&#xD;
ning, and carefully detailing the approaches of the cap-&#xD;
tam, the pros and cons of himself and Mrs. Meredith, till,&#xD;
unable to imagine what might be coming, Walter, in&#xD;
painful 'suspense, awaited the conclusion. At length&#xD;
Mr. Meredith arrived at the final dismissal of the captain,&#xD;
and the avowal of Eleaiior, which, as might have been&#xD;
expected, shocked her conscientious young tutor as much&#xD;
as her parents.' He said nothing, however, but his sud-&#xD;
den paleness evinced his sympathy with them, and, at-&#xD;
&#xD;
tracing the notice of Mrs. Meredith, she reproached her-&#xD;
self for her inattention, and begged him "to take some&#xD;
refreshment, for he lo ed dreadfully fatigued." But he&#xD;
declined; and, after few* moments, said, "You spoke&#xD;
as if I could serve you, sir; in what way can I do so?&#xD;
You can not mean in relation to Miss Eleanor."&#xD;
"Yes, I do. Let me explain, however," continued Mr.&#xD;
~1/&#xD;
Meredith, his habitual formality yiek1ing, in spite of his&#xD;
endeavors to the contrary, to emotions of pain and dis-&#xD;
pleasure. "Let me explain. Sheds more confidential&#xD;
with you than with us. The neces~y restraint between&#xD;
parents and children has sometimes a bad effect. We&#xD;
shouk~ alarM and repress; you will calm and encourage&#xD;
her. And letme take this opportunity, Mr. Thornley, to&#xD;
say, that, in giving you this proof of our confidence, we&#xD;
only properly reward your remarkable discretion in a sit-&#xD;
uation calling for more than is usually found. I have ob-&#xD;
served you closely, as I was bound to do, where the inter-&#xD;
est of an only child was at stake; and I must say; that&#xD;
while you have exacted your due respect as her teach-&#xD;
er, you have never forgotten your relative positions."&#xD;
A cold bow on the part of Walter acknowledged this&#xD;
not ambiguous compliment. He was not, insensible to&#xD;
the confidence expressed, nor to the inferiority implied.&#xD;
"We are, therefore," proceeded Mr. Meredith, "glad&#xD;
to depute you to a delicate office, for which you are,&#xD;
perhaps, better' fitted than ourselves."&#xD;
"But what, sir inquired Walter, anxious to termin-&#xD;
ate in any way this oppressive interview, "what can I&#xD;
possibly do?"&#xD;
"You must see her before we do; must obtain from&#xD;
her a full disclosure of every thing-of her real feel-&#xD;
ings-for we are not without suspicion that she may&#xD;
be entangled through mere thoughtlessness. She may&#xD;
even be glad to be assisted in escaping from some fool-&#xD;

ish involvement, which she would sooner expose to you&#xD;
than to us. You can sift this more calmly than we can.&#xD;
If~ on the contrary, her affections are really interested,&#xD;
you are at liberty to assure her that we disregard riches;&#xD;
that, ifthe connection be not disgraceful, in other words,&#xD;
if the person is her equal in birth and position, she shall&#xD;
not be opposed, provided, at the same time, that his char-&#xD;
acter secures her happiness, for this is all that we desire.&#xD;
It is~best not to delay," added he, as Walter sat silent,&#xD;
troubled and irresolute; "you will find her in the&#xD;
study."&#xD;
With an effort Walter rose to obey; a beseeching&#xD;
look from Mrs. Meredith expressed her dependence on&#xD;
him, and he left the room without speaking.&#xD;
In the mean time, Eleanor, having escaped from her&#xD;
lover, had taken refuge in her favorite retreat. There,&#xD;
throwing herself on a sofa, she saw only the good joke&#xD;
she had practiced, laughed merrily, and then burst forth&#xD;
in ~ pleasant old $cotch song, which struck her as par~&#xD;
ticularly applicable to her case:&#xD;
"The blude-red rose at Yule may blaw,&#xD;
The simmer lilies bloom hi snaw;&#xD;
The frost may freeze the deepest sea,&#xD;
But an old man shall never daunton me."&#xD;
As the song passed away into a mere murmur of the&#xD;
melody, she ceased to think of the captain at all, and&#xD;
turned her thoughts to a more agreeable subject.&#xD;
"What a pity," thought she," that Mr. Thornley does&#xD;
not come! I wonder who that sick friend is that he&#xD;
stays to take care of. Well, it is very good of him, and&#xD;
all right too; but that is nothing new-he always does&#xD;
what is right. But when .he does come! he will see I&#xD;
have not been idle. Lhave read all the history he di-&#xD;
rected, and made all the abstracts he advised; and as to&#xD;
chro~plogy! why, like an Arab, I have absolutely lived&#xD;
&#xD;
on dates! and I have really attended to all my studies&#xD;
as well as II could in his absence; and when he ilnds&#xD;
this he will be so pleased! and I shall be so happy 1"&#xD;
In proof of which she clapped her hands, the sound of&#xD;
which still rung in her ears as the door opened and Mr.&#xD;
Thornley entered.&#xD;
With a loOk of joyous surprise she hastened to meet&#xD;
him, exclaiming, "Mr. Thornley! when did you come?&#xD;
You are welcome back again !"&#xD;
"You are very kind-very good, Misa Eleanor," lie&#xD;
replied, and, unconsciously retaining the hand she had&#xD;
extended, he led her again to the sofa, and seated him..&#xD;
self by her side.&#xD;
Pouring forth question on question as tQ "what he&#xD;
had been doing all this long time? if he had been always&#xD;
reading and studying, as usual? or if he had been fish'&#xD;
ing, shooting, and rambling in the beautiful forests he&#xD;
was so fond of?"-~-to all which he answering only in&#xD;
grave monosyllables, she suddenly stopped, and, look-&#xD;
ing earnestly and inquiringly in his face, said, "What&#xD;
is the matter, Mr. Thoruley ?"&#xD;
To this he could but reply in that unmeaning "Noth-&#xD;
ing," which so often belies a full heart.&#xD;
"Oh yes there is," she repeated; "something has hap.&#xD;
pened, I am sure of-your friend-"&#xD;
"lie is well."&#xD;
"Yet you. don't look happy. You are disturbed, per-&#xD;
chaps displeased-but not displeased with me, are you,&#xD;
Mr. Thornley? Tell me if you are. If I have done&#xD;
any thing wrong I will acknowledge it. You know I&#xD;
always confess to you.," added she, half playfully; "but&#xD;
do, do speak, and don't look at me so 1"&#xD;
She might well indeed deprecate the fixed and search-&#xD;
ing gaze with which, while still holding her hand, he&#xD;
regarded her.&#xD;

"Confess !" he at length said; "yes, Miss Eleanor,&#xD;
that is what I have come for, hut UOtr as I believe, to&#xD;
heai~ny thing 'wrong;' nor am I so presumptuou'~ as&#xD;
to ~llyou to confession without authority. I come,"&#xD;
s~ia ~bT~; ~sp~i~tely~huiging into the troubled waters&#xD;
he had been directed to sound, "by the i~qs'~6~our&#xD;
parents. They speak by me.&#xD;
I~leanor, regarding him in surprise, agitation, and&#xD;
alarm, could say nothing, and he proceeded, in a tender&#xD;
and encouraging tone:&#xD;
"Your parents authorize me to say that they have no&#xD;
wish but for your happiness. All they ask is that your&#xD;
affections should be really interested-that no transient&#xD;
fancy should mislead you-" Walter paused.&#xD;
"What do you mean, Mr. Thoruley?" said Eleanor,&#xD;
with a happier, but still a bewildered look.&#xD;
"They care not" he continued, "that he whom you&#xD;
choose should be rich, provided he be your equal and&#xD;
worthy of your affec&amp;amp;n."&#xD;
"Worthy 1" repeated Eleanor, heeding only that con-&#xD;
dition? and clasping her hands with a~ look more ex.~&#xD;
pressive than words, from which Walter easily inferred&#xD;
a fond confidence in some one. But who was that per.&#xD;
son?&#xD;
With a less-assured voice he proceeded:&#xD;
"You admit, then, Eleanor, that you are not indiffer-&#xD;
ent-4hat 'an' impression has been made-that a ~enfi-&#xD;
rnent-~--that your heart is not insensible. Have, then,&#xD;
'no farther reserves," continued he, in the gentle tones&#xD;
of persuasion; "I ask it for yovtr parents-for yourself.&#xD;
I 'even presume so far' as to ask it for myself. DQ not&#xD;
withhold from me this assurance of your-"&#xD;
"Fr~endsh~p," he would have said, but her embarrass.&#xD;
ment and agitation appeared contagious, and he hesita-&#xD;
ted. If her imagination supplied a more tender word,&#xD;
&#xD;
it was '~not strange; nor, unconscious as she ha~ thus far&#xD;
been. of the 'sentiment so innocently entertaine~, was it&#xD;
to be wondered at if it were suddenly revealed to her by&#xD;
the touchstone now applied.&#xD;
"Oh, Walter!" exclaimed the blushing girl, misled by&#xD;
language that she supposed could have but one mean~&#xD;
ing, "for yourself! How can I withh~l~l any thing from&#xD;
you! You, whom, next to my p~trents, I love better than.~&#xD;
any one in the whole world! Oh," continued she, coy-&#xD;
ering her face with her hands, "you must know what I&#xD;
would say!"&#xD;
It was, indeed, but too plain. Astonished and con~&#xD;
founded, yet, with one exquisite thrill of joy, he darted&#xD;
from her side, approached the window, and, resting his&#xD;
head on his hands, leaned against the casing without&#xD;
having uttered a word; while Eleanor, starting as ~&#xD;
from a dream, and terrified at this strange reception of&#xD;
what deserved a very different one, repeated, in broken&#xD;
sentences and trembling voice, "What have I said?&#xD;
What have I said? Walter-Mr. Thornley, I mean-&#xD;
tell me; what have I said ?"&#xD;
"Dear, innocent, ~meonscions Eleanor," exclaimed he&#xD;
in great~ emotion, returning to his seat, and taking both&#xD;
her hands in his, "nothing! You have said nothing&#xD;
into which you have not been involuntarily led by the&#xD;
misconceptions of others, and by your ow~i guileless, af-&#xD;
fectionate heart! Nothing, Eleanor, that does not make&#xD;
you dearer to me than ever! Thus much I owe you;&#xD;
more I dare not, must not say. Honor, gratitude, un~&#xD;
limited confidence reposed in me, forbid it. There has&#xD;
been some strange mistake. You alone can explain it."&#xD;
It was done in few words1 but often interrupted by&#xD;
the confusion and distress of Eleanor, by he~ self-accu-&#xD;
sation of folly and stupidity. The explanation given,&#xD;
a few moments of "thoughts unutterable" succeeded,&#xD;

156          WALTER TIIORNLEY; OR?&#xD;
Walter's eyes riveted on her face with a fondness he&#xD;
dared not express, she almost convulsed with contend-&#xD;
ii~g emotions.&#xD;
At length, rising with a dignity inspired in moments&#xD;
of emergency, and often where it seems least to be ex-&#xD;
pected, Eleanor said, though with an uncertain and quiv-&#xD;
ering voice, "Mr. Thornley, I have but one request to&#xD;
make, forget every thing I have been so foolish as to&#xD;
say; remember only. that I am, and shall always be,&#xD;
your grateful pupil." Then, turning' to the door, she&#xD;
would have instantly passed it, but, detaining her with&#xD;
an impulse he could not resist, and with feelings nearly&#xD;
overpowering him, he ventured only to say, "I forget&#xD;
every thing, Eleanor, but yourself."&#xD;
The next moment she was gone; but, having reached&#xD;
her own room, tears, long suppressed, burst ~rth. Pride&#xD;
and mortification, however mingling at first in this pas-&#xD;
sionate outpouring, were not the predominant emotions.&#xD;
Generous herself, she confided in the generosity of oth-&#xD;
ers. She believed Walter superior to the little vanity&#xD;
of a triumph over her weakness. Moreover~ much as he&#xD;
had struggled to conceal it, she saw the reciprocal senti-&#xD;
ment that agitated him, and she loved and trusted him&#xD;
the more for hisforbearance. The violence of her feet.&#xD;
ings abated only to subside into grief at the reflection&#xD;
that of one s~ noble she must never think. For when&#xD;
no longer deluded by ambiguous expressions, to which&#xD;
excitement and affection had affixed her own meaning,&#xD;
she saw but too plainly that her parents, whatever might&#xD;
be their opinion of Walter, would never favor such a&#xD;
union. Nor was ii; less certain that he himself so con-&#xD;
sidered his position that he would never seek it. She&#xD;
could now understand and honor his hitherto reserved&#xD;
deportment, often, as she had thought, unnecessarily cold&#xD;
and formal; intermingled with rare but delightful flashes&#xD;

manifestations which, however guarded, had involun-&#xD;
tarily nourished a sentiment the innocent girl little com-&#xD;
prehended, and of the tendency of which she had never&#xD;
thought.&#xD;
Nothing now remaincdfor Eleanor but the resolution&#xD;
to render herself more deserving 0P the esteem of one&#xD;
whom," shQ felt quite sure she must always love." This,&#xD;
though a very natural conclusion for a girl ~f sixteen, is&#xD;
not always in conformity with experience in such cases.&#xD;

WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
WALTER, left alone in the study-that place to him&#xD;
so consecrated, where he had first knownhis own power&#xD;
in the training of an ingenuous young mind, and in the&#xD;
harder task of governing his own under influences there&#xD;
fir4f~fel~4he scpne 'of many happy hours never again to&#xD;
return-~.yielded without restraint to his em6tion~. He&#xD;
perfectly well understood that the confidence reposed in&#xD;
him by Mr. and Mrs. Meredith, whatever might be his&#xD;
personal claims, was greatly assisted by what they con-&#xD;
sidered the insuperable barriers between him and their&#xD;
daughter, a confidence confirme y the manner he had&#xD;
carefully and hones maintain toward her. He could&#xD;
not, therefore, f9r an instant be deluded into an idea&#xD;
that they would relax a single prejudice in favor of what&#xD;
they would condemn as a mesalliance. "Besides71' he re-&#xD;
flected, "even if they would overlook a humble origin,&#xD;
how would they, how must they repel a nameless, un-&#xD;
acknowledged-most probably base-born-son of a fa-&#xD;
ther disgraced perhaps himself and disgracing others!&#xD;
INo; it was impossible! He would stifle the fondest feel-&#xD;
ing of his heart rather than subject himself to the indig-&#xD;
nity such an aspiration would 1~e sure to call down on&#xD;
him!"                     3&#xD;
But this resolution cost him pangs never before known.&#xD;
The conflict was not, indeed, new to him. From the mo-&#xD;
ment he had felt his growing interest he had striven to&#xD;
repre~ it. He had avoided every thing that might be-&#xD;
tray it. He had even congratulated himself in the be-&#xD;
lief that Eleanor's open, child-like expression of regard&#xD;
for him was proof that she had no stronger interest in&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT TEE PAST.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
him-a belief confirmed by her apparent liking for y~ung&#xD;
Middleton. He had even voluntarily torn himself away,&#xD;
and had reluctantly promised to returr~i, only in the hope&#xD;
that absence might increase his self-contr6l, considering&#xD;
it permitted to do so if he endangered no one but him-&#xD;
self. But now even a harder battle was to be fought.&#xD;
Hp had not to conquer vain desires for an unattainable&#xD;
good, but to reject it wh~ perhaps a bold' hand might&#xD;
secure it. He who had never known love from woniari's&#xD;
lips, must he now refuse it from those dearest to him? He&#xD;
who had never been soothed by the sympathy of moth.&#xD;
er or sister, must he now reject it from one who could&#xD;
give more even than these? Must he, turn from her&#xD;
who had been the fresh, young, innocent Eve of his&#xD;
imagination,&#xD;
"Infusing&#xD;
Sweetness into his heart unfelt before ?"&#xD;
The confession, so unlocked for, which had at once ag-&#xD;
onized and delighted him, must it be repulsed and cast&#xD;
away?&#xD;
For the first time utterly unmanned, he buried his face&#xD;
in the cushion of the sofa, unconscious that he wept, till&#xD;
an approaching footstep recalled him to himself. Start-&#xD;
ing up, he recollected that Mr. Meredith was still await-&#xD;
ing the explanation of what now seemed so trivial that&#xD;
it was nearly forgotten, and he hastened to communi-&#xD;
cate it.&#xD;
In the relief thus afforded, Mr. and Mrs. Meredith soon&#xD;
forgave the pain so childishly inflicted. While they were&#xD;
congratulating themselves, Walter was left to reflect on&#xD;
his p'~sent position, and, with his usual promptitude, to&#xD;
decide what was best-.--best for himself best for Eleanor.&#xD;
He must go, and go immediately. His first thought was&#xD;
to take no leave, to depart in ,the evening without ex-&#xD;
planation. This, as his luggage was still at the stage-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
house, would be easy. But this might subject him to&#xD;
unjust inferences. It might, too, in some way compro-&#xD;
mise Eleanor. He determined? therefore? on a course&#xD;
which, without the utterance of an untruth, would ren-&#xD;
der' his departure, if unexpected, not mysterious. His&#xD;
cogitations were interrupted by an exclamation from&#xD;
Mr. Meredith.&#xD;
"Bless me! we are entirely forgetting every thing&#xD;
else in our~own affairs. I have never asked after my&#xD;
old friend Mr. Grafton; 'tell me, is he well? *does time&#xD;
make much impression on him ?"&#xD;
~ So little," replied Walter, "that really I never think&#xD;
of it. His early hours, regular habits, and quiet pur-&#xD;
suits prevent wear and tear."&#xD;
"I suppose so. Yet he is nearly my age-not far&#xD;
from fifty. Poor Grafton! he was a handsome man&#xD;
once."&#xD;
Walter thought the sigh with which this was uttered&#xD;
uncalled for, and replied, "lie is so still, sir; and no&#xD;
one would imagine from his manners or appearance that&#xD;
he had been so long out of the world."&#xD;
"Ah! indeed! But the inborn, inbred gentleman is&#xD;
a strong plant, ~not to be choked by the vulgar weeds&#xD;
that may start up around it. Well, now, to matters&#xD;
nearer home. When shall lessons begin? Eleanor has&#xD;
had a long holiday, and will, I dare say, be glad to re-&#xD;
sume them."&#xD;
This was the moment Walter had been serving him-&#xD;
self to meet.'&#xD;
"I am grieved to say," replied he, "that I can remain&#xD;
only long enough to say farewell."&#xD;
"Farewell!" echoed both Mr. and Mrs. Meredith in&#xD;
the same breath; "farewell! what! really leave us?&#xD;
and why ?"&#xD;
In a few words Walter informed them that he was&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE ~'A5T.&#xD;
&#xD;
161&#xD;
&#xD;
compelled to do SO? adding~ with a poor aff~pt a~ a&#xD;
smile, "You know? sir, if we can not control circum-&#xD;
staPces, they must control u&amp;amp;'&#xD;
His maimer was so decided, audi being, at the same&#xD;
time, as calm as they could expect under what he did&#xD;
not hesitate to confess was a very painful separation,&#xD;
that happily the idea of a sudden determination did not&#xD;
occur to them, and their good-breeding spared all inter-&#xD;
rogations as to reasons which he did not voluntarily of-&#xD;
fer. Mr. Meredith only said, with much earnestness,&#xD;
that, if pecuniary considerations influenced him, he would&#xD;
make any additional compensation he would name. He&#xD;
graciously added that "Eleanor owed more to his in-&#xD;
struction than to all she had ever previously received."&#xD;
This generosity, at this moment, was too much for&#xD;
Walter, and he did not immediately reply.&#xD;
"You are. too kind, sir, too kind, to attach so much&#xD;
value to my small services. Believe me, money should&#xD;
not part us. I have always been, and am still, perfect-&#xD;
ly satisfied with what I have received."&#xD;
Mrs. Meredit~h, too, with much cordiality, expressed&#xD;
her regret, her sense of the benefit conferred on Elea-&#xD;
nor, and the difficulty of replacing his ability and care,&#xD;
"Well, if you must leave us, Mr. Thornley," said Mr.&#xD;
Meredith, "we will not consider it a final separation;&#xD;
something may bring us together again. I shall always&#xD;
be happy to serve you in any way that I can, and to&#xD;
testify to your faithfulness, and to your correct and be-&#xD;
coming behavior in my family during nearly an entire&#xD;
year that you have lived with us."&#xD;
At this certificate of character, much the same as&#xD;
would have been accorded to any approved domestic, it&#xD;
must be confessed Walter's. pride rebelled. The color&#xD;
returned to his cheek from which emotion had driven&#xD;
it; but he forgave the unintentional insult. At that&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7727-00000083"/>&#xD;
162          WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
moment he could not otherwise; yet it fixed, as with&#xD;
an iron grasp, into his soul the conviction of the scorn&#xD;
with which his love would be repulsed; and he blessed&#xD;
Heaven that he had not been so weak as to expose him-&#xD;
self to it. He only by a bow returned his acknowledg-&#xD;
ments.&#xD;
"But you will not leave us immediately ?",&#xD;
'~ To-night, sir," said Walter, with a resolution- for&#xD;
which he was probably indebted to Mr. Meredith's pro-&#xD;
posed "recommendation." "I shall walk into town in&#xD;
the evening, for, having no luggage to transport, I shall&#xD;
not need to put your horses into requisition."&#xD;
This met with much opposition, and it was not with-&#xD;
out reiterated assurances that he really preferred it that&#xD;
it was assented to.&#xD;
"I don't know what Eleanor will say to all this," said&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith, kindly. "She will be much disappoint-&#xD;
ed."&#xD;
Walter allowedVhimself no reply, except that, "with&#xD;
the progress Miss Eleanor had made, she would require&#xD;
little direction in future."&#xD;
* But, under this quiet exterior, how did his heart beat&#xD;
at thought of the parting now so near! The striking&#xD;
of the clock announced the approach of dinner, and he&#xD;
listened with a sickened feeling for her footstep on the&#xD;
stairs. But, when assembled at table, instead of herself&#xD;
came a whispered message to Mrs. Meredith.&#xD;
"Eleanor has a bad headache, my dear, and begs to&#xD;
be excused."&#xD;
"A headache !" replied her husband, "I never knew&#xD;
her to have one in her life. What has she been doing ?"&#xD;
"Oh," said Mrs. Meredith, innocently, "you know she&#xD;
must have had rather an exciting scene with Captaiti&#xD;
'?Palbot this morning."&#xD;
"True, true,'~ replied he, laughing, "and 'tis but a&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT TUE PAST.             163&#xD;
&#xD;
fair punishment for the heartache she gave him. Be-&#xD;
sides, I dare say she is rather ashamed to appear after&#xD;
such a silly business; and well she m~y be.&#xD;
"But," added he, gravely, "it is just as I have said;&#xD;
no care, no restraint keeps young people in order in&#xD;
these days. Now her mother, Mr. Thornley, would no&#xD;
more have dared so to trifle with a gentleman than she&#xD;
would have presumed to laugh in the king's face. I&#xD;
don't know wlat we are coming to! No respect to age,&#xD;
dignity, nor condition! Young people think they may&#xD;
say, think, do 'any thing they please !"&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith took advantage of the first paus~ in her&#xD;
husband's outpouring on a subject that always excited&#xD;
him, to say, "I think, Mr. Thornicy, I will not tell Ele-&#xD;
anor just now that you are going. She will sleep off&#xD;
her headache, I dare say, and be able to bid you good~&#xD;
by."&#xD;
Walter blessed the headache and the delay, devoutly&#xD;
hoping to escape 'without putting her to the test of a&#xD;
farewell.&#xD;
In the afternoon, to conceal, if he could not check, the&#xD;
feelin~ that increased as the final hour approached, he&#xD;
strolled off into the woods that at a short distance screen-&#xD;
ed the house, and yielded, when thus in security, to the&#xD;
thoughts that oppressed him.&#xD;
The past, checkered as it was by conflicts, fears~ and&#xD;
doubts peculiar to his strange position, had yet had one&#xD;
bright ligkit thrown athwart it. One exquisite delight&#xD;
had been granted him. He had known what it was to&#xD;
love and to be loved; and, short as had been the joy,&#xD;
and compassed. with obstructions, it had repaid him for&#xD;
many sorrows. He would not part with it to secure im-&#xD;
munity from all earthly ill. But the future, what did&#xD;
that offer? A hopeless remembrance of one by whom,&#xD;
if true to his sense of right, he must pray to be forgotten.&#xD;

WALTER THORNJ1~EY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
'Ik&#xD;
&#xD;
Forgotten! oh, the dreadful import of that word! 1~ven&#xD;
in the grave-~--cold, insensible, dissolving-we can not&#xD;
bear it; it adds the keenest pang to death. Even in&#xD;
heaven, we crave to be remembered on earth! What,&#xD;
then, was it to a young heart throbbing with passions&#xD;
newly awakened, with wants that would not be denied,&#xD;
conscious of its power to enjoy and to create happiness,&#xD;
of its own inherent right to it-what was it to such a&#xD;
one to set a seal on the fountain of bliss, to turn away&#xD;
from hope, to reject love, to pray to be forgotten? Yet&#xD;
this Wafter felt to be his future.&#xD;
Long, long he wandered; revolving every circum-&#xD;
stance since first he had known Eleanor. At' one mo-&#xD;
ment rebuking . his own coldness as cruel, the next re-&#xD;
joicing in it as their only safety. Now dwelling on her&#xD;
sweet unconsciousness, her ingenuous confession, her&#xD;
maidenly dignity when aware that it was unsought;&#xD;
and then turning to the present, the parting moment.&#xD;
The slanting lights that streamed beneath the branch-&#xD;
es, and the long shadows warned him to return, and,&#xD;
with indescribable dread, he bent his steps toward the&#xD;
house. With a sad longing for one more look he en-&#xD;
tered the study by the garden-door, and cast a glance at&#xD;
every familiar object, as if taking the superfluous trouble&#xD;
of fixing them. indelibly in his memory. At length his&#xD;
eye fell on the study-table, where, among scattered books,&#xD;
lay an unopened letter. He took 'it hastily up, the first&#xD;
thought being that it was a farewell from Eleanor. lie&#xD;
turned to the superscription. It was directed to him-&#xD;
self; but not in her hand, lie opened it, and the change&#xD;
in his countenance sufficiently indicated the revulsion&#xD;
in his fee1i~igs. lit wa~ as follows:&#xD;
"Rash, obstinate young man! Again you have per-&#xD;
iled yourself and those who 'ought to be even dearer to&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.           165&#xD;
you. Return without delay to the security provided for&#xD;
you, or involve yourself in consequences you will for-&#xD;
ever repent. Obey I"&#xD;
The feelings with which Walter had b~eu struggling&#xD;
for hours, now taking another direction, burst forth like&#xD;
a tempest. He threw the letter on. the floor. He stamp-&#xD;
ed on it. He caught it up, and! was about to tear it in&#xD;
pieces, when a thought seemed to eheck him.&#xD;
"No!" exclaimed he,"it shall remain till the day of&#xD;
reckoning comes. 'Security provided for me!' and by.&#xD;
whom? Not by him who cast me a ,beggar on the char-&#xD;
'ty of strangers. 'Obey!' and whom? Not him whose&#xD;
forfeited word has~ no claim on me. Oh, that I could&#xD;
stay here and brave him! that honor did not demand&#xD;
my departure! I would fearlessly encounter his threats.&#xD;
Intolerable! that by going I shall seem to act in obedi-&#xD;
ence to commands that I scorn and reject. Oh, that I&#xD;
could tell him to his ~teeth that I am not his slave and&#xD;
puppet, to be controlled and played as he may please!&#xD;
I, a man, conipetent to be treated lik9' a reasonable being,&#xD;
to be thus addressed like a boy or fool!"&#xD;
Ringing the bell, he inquired of the servant who an-&#xD;
swered it who had left a letter for him? Nobody.&#xD;
Could no one have entered without his knowledge?&#xD;
No, he had been occupied in or near the ball. But the&#xD;
study? Ah! yes, there a person might~have entered&#xD;
through the garden.&#xD;
The servant was too trusty to be suspected of collu-&#xD;
sion, and on farther . inquiry, the other domestics were&#xD;
equally ignorant.&#xD;
The tea-bell at this moment summoned him, and, corn-&#xD;
p6lled to leave the mystery unexplained, he obeyed it.&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith, with considerate kindness, had ordered&#xD;

ration for his long walk; and with trembling steps he&#xD;
entered the room where. she sat ready to receive him,&#xD;
"(or now surely he must meet Eleanor !" Seating him-&#xD;
seig as requested by Mrs. Meredith, he reflected that&#xD;
some little show of natural feeling would be allowed on&#xD;
such an occasion, and thus both he and Eleanor might&#xD;
escape a strict construction. Nirs. Meredith proceeded&#xD;
to dispense the good things she had ordered, though to&#xD;
little purpose; and, after lamenting that he ate nothing,&#xD;
said, in her kindest tone, desirous of softening the dis.&#xD;
appointment to him, "I am so sorry, Mr. TkLornley, that&#xD;
you can not see Eleanor; she is really quite indisposed&#xD;
with this very inopportune headache, and begs me to&#xD;
bid you good-by for her."&#xD;
No relief could have been greater.&#xD;
"She understands me," thought Walter; "she for-&#xD;
bears to add to my distress by either seeing me or ques-&#xD;
tioning my motives. God forever bless her"~&#xD;
With this prayer in his heart, and a kind farewell to&#xD;
her on his lips, he rose to take leave, and was soon on&#xD;
his way to the city. After a few hours of troubled sleep,&#xD;
at three o'clock he was roused by the driver's thunder-&#xD;
ing rap at his door, and a lighted candle thrust into his&#xD;
room to assist him to make his hasty toilet.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
WALTER'S unexpected reappearance at Ashton ex-&#xD;
cited no small sensation. Mr. Grafton met him at the&#xD;
door with a look of alarm, exclaiming," Walter! Has&#xD;
any thing happened? Our friends! are they well ?"&#xD;
"Quite so," replied Walter, assuming a cheerfulness&#xD;
he coula not feel, in order to dissipate ~he uneasiness he&#xD;
had caused. "Quite so, and myself too, or I shall be&#xD;
as soon as Damie gives me one of her good counti~y&#xD;
teas."&#xD;
While Damie's efforts were thus directed, Walter en.&#xD;
deavored still more to assure Mr. Grafton by talking&#xD;
with unconcern of his journey, the weather, and other&#xD;
ordinary topics, deferring till left to finish the evening&#xD;
without interruption such explanation as he felt at lib-&#xD;
erty to give.&#xD;
As soon as the fitting time occurred, "I think," said&#xD;
he, affectionately taking his guardian's hand, "I think,&#xD;
my dear sir, that I have never had a secret from you,&#xD;
and, moreover, I believe you have never distrusted my&#xD;
word ?"&#xD;
"Never," replied Mr. Grafton, earnestly, "neveT."&#xD;
"Then I think you will pardon me if I have one&#xD;
now, and that you will also continue to trust me."&#xD;
"Yes, without the least question;. yes."&#xD;
"I thank you, sir. So far' I can satisfy you, that,~&#xD;
though I have left Mr. Meredith's family with no inten-&#xD;
tion of returning, my so doing involves no one in the&#xD;
least blame. On the contrary, could I think it right to&#xD;
be more explicit, I know you would approve of what I&#xD;
have done, and be satisfied with all concerned."&#xD;

&#xD;
"This shall suffice, Walter; I ask no more."&#xD;
Walter pressed his hand, and they were both silent.&#xD;
A~t length, opening his pocket-book, Walter drew forth&#xD;
a letter, which he handed to Mr. Grafton.&#xD;
"That," said he, "may reconcile you to the step I&#xD;
have taken. I know you have some apprehensions from&#xD;
that quarter, and will be glad that, by apparent submis-&#xD;
sion,, I have avoided threatened danger. I say apparent,&#xD;
because I must in truth tell you that the letter had noth-&#xD;
ing to do with my decision. That was formed before&#xD;
I received it."&#xD;
" It is extraordinary !" said Mr. Grafton, after reading&#xD;
and returning the letter, "most extraordinary! How&#xD;
did this Jetter ,reach you ?"&#xD;
"Like every thing from the same source. I found it&#xD;
where it had been placed for me in my absence. How&#xD;
or by. whom I could not discover."&#xD;
After some reflection Mr.~ Grafton continued, "I do&#xD;
not require to be 'reconciled,' as you say, to your re-&#xD;
turn; but this does diminish any regret I might feel as&#xD;
to the manner of it, for I do not deny that I am often&#xD;
troubled by the threats that you are so willing to brave.&#xD;
You then, for the presents will, I trust, be content t~&#xD;
remain here. Thank Heaven, w&amp;amp;can be happy in spite&#xD;
of the persecutions by which you are followed."&#xD;
But Mr. Grafton was not long in discovering that&#xD;
Walter was not happy. The manly cheerfulness worn&#xD;
at first to relieve his friend soon disappeared, and, if oc-&#xD;
casionally roused to something like his natural anima-&#xD;
tion, it was plainly an effort. To such alternations he.&#xD;
had been subject, but there was now an air of dejec.&#xD;
tion, very different from the fitful moods of' previous&#xD;
years, easily explained by the irritation of his peculiar&#xD;
condition. There was nothing to be gained by ques-&#xD;
tioning him. The matter, whatever it was, was decided.&#xD;
&#xD;
fx&#xD;
&#xD;
There was no perturbation, no apparent conflict. He&#xD;
occupied himself much as usual; was kind to old friends,&#xD;
and more than ever affection~te to Mr. Grafton; but a&#xD;
change had come over him, t eli h of hope and youth&#xD;
seemed extinguished.&#xD;
Mr. Grafton observed him with the tenderest solici-&#xD;
tude; ~nd one evening when they were alone, Walter&#xD;
dreamingly gazing at a beautiful moon that sent a beam&#xD;
into their room as if "to pleasure them," he approached;&#xD;
and, laying his hand ~n his shoulder, said, in a gentle,&#xD;
half-playful tone, "It is asserted that no man is the bet-&#xD;
ter for the experience of another; that each must find&#xD;
out the secret of life for himself. Perhaps this is so;&#xD;
but the heart, nevertheless, often lon,~s to impart what&#xD;
K      it has learned, and I-I would-i-"&#xD;
His voice failed, and, turning away, he left the&#xD;
room. The next night Walter found, on retiring to&#xD;
his room, a packet containing the following from his&#xD;
guardian:&#xD;
"Mv DEAR WALTER,-I would ITluch prefer speech to&#xD;
this more formal mode of communication, but I am not&#xD;
equal $~o it. It is not easy, indeed, for me in any way&#xD;
to enter into the details of my life; to dwell on scenes&#xD;
that years have not obliterated. I shall therefore be as&#xD;
brief tts is consistent with the purpose for which I write.&#xD;
The afflictions and disappointments that meet us in ear-&#xD;
ly 'life, from their very strangeness, are apt to appear to&#xD;
us greater in our individual experience than any one&#xD;
else has ever known. .We yield ourselves to them as&#xD;
if spell-bound, we exaggerate them until from ministers&#xD;
of wholesome discipline they become our tyrants, and&#xD;
ourwhole lives not infrequently are discolored by them.&#xD;
But I will leave you to make your own reflections on&#xD;
hat I have to communicate.&#xD;

&#xD;
WALTER THOENLEY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
"You know me only as 11 have been associated&#xD;
with yourself~ I must, therefore, begin at the begin-&#xD;
iiing.&#xD;
"I am, by my mother, of English descent; but, as&#xD;
her family came to this country soon after her birth, she&#xD;
was regarded as American by all but herself. She, on&#xD;
the contrary, cherished an attachment to her native&#xD;
country, and never lost it, not even when she married&#xD;
into a colonial family of considerable importance. For&#xD;
my misfortune, both my parents died young, leaving&#xD;
me, their only child, with a sufficient but not large patri-&#xD;
mony. In conformity with the wish of my mother, I vis-&#xD;
ited England after completing my education; and, while&#xD;
there, my home' was with my only near maternal rela-&#xD;
tive, my mother's sister, who had married an English-&#xD;
man, and had thus been replanted into the native soil.&#xD;
My life there was so happy that I can not re~ollect a&#xD;
shadow, except a regret for one sweet young face, which&#xD;
again to see was the prevailing wish~of my heart. I re.&#xD;
turned, and found it even more lovely than my fancy&#xD;
had painted it. We~ met as friends, for I had from a&#xD;
youth been domesticated in her father's house. From&#xD;
friends we became lovers, with the approval Qf her pa-&#xD;
rents, and with every circumstance propitious to our&#xD;
union, which was not long to be delayed.&#xD;
"But a dark cloud was to intervene.. The discon-&#xD;
tents between the mother country and her col~iies gath-&#xD;
ered to a head. To angry passions succeeded conflict.&#xD;
Blood was shed, the sword drawn, and, at length, civil&#xD;
war burst forth.&#xD;
"My position was one of intense anxiety. With my&#xD;
English ties and my mother's blood, it seemed nothing,&#xD;
short of parricidal to take up arms with the colonists; 'in&#xD;
addition to which, I had~been trained in so loyal a spir-&#xD;
it, confirmed by my happy da~s in England, that' my&#xD;
&#xD;
ii&#xD;
&#xD;
prejudices were on that side. Still II could not shut my&#xD;
eyes to the wrongs of my countrymen, and: their right&#xD;
of redress; and, as long as their 'efforts were confined to&#xD;
remonstrance and attempts at conciliation, my sympa-&#xD;
thies were. American. But independence seemed a de-&#xD;
lusion, and rebellion was abhorrent ~'to me.&#xD;
"In this conflict of affections, I saw nothing but to leave&#xD;
myself for a time, to the current of events, continually&#xD;
hoping that our difficulties might be adjusted; and that,&#xD;
if not, 'I might be permitted to continue neutral, as [ had&#xD;
thus Thx been. But alas! the storm burst on me from a&#xD;
quarter where I least looked for it.&#xD;
"The father of Mary, the possessor of a large landed&#xD;
property conferred on his ancestors by the ~crown, re-&#xD;
nounced his allegiance, ht the peril of his life and estate.&#xD;
Having taken this step he could not brook my passive&#xD;
position. Accustomed to be obeyed, he required me,&#xD;
young, unimportant, and divided as I was, to follow his&#xD;
exan~ple or to relinquish his daughter. Mutual friends&#xD;
endeavored to reduce him to a more reasonable i~emper,&#xD;
but opposition only 'inflamed him. Froni. condemning&#xD;
my conduct he passed to suspecting my motives, and,&#xD;
finally, insulted me by a charge of cowardice. '.My love&#xD;
to Mary had but one measure. She was dearer to me&#xD;
than~ life, but not than honor. To have yielded to his&#xD;
requisitions even to obtain her,' as 'at firsf demanded,' I&#xD;
should have'felt to be a disgrace; but when to' this was&#xD;
added insult, to comply was a degree of baseness for&#xD;
which I i~o language. Cowardice! God~knows how&#xD;
much more courage~ was required to renounce my alle-&#xD;
giance to Mary than to my king!&#xD;
"Such'treatment'on his. part provoked retort on mine.&#xD;
His accusation was resented in terms that rendered all&#xD;
farther application or remonstrance impossible. One al-&#xD;
terhative alone occurred 'to me. At this juncture it re-&#xD;

ceived an urgent entreaty from ~y aunt in England to&#xD;
come to her. She was left a widow, with an embarrassed&#xD;
property, and she had no friend but myself who could,&#xD;
or who would assist her to save something from the&#xD;
wreck for herself and daughter. IL could not refuse.&#xD;
I determined at once to go, but my heart suggested,&#xD;
'why not take Mary too?' if I could overcome her re-&#xD;
pugnatlee to a clandestine union. This was a fearful&#xD;
uncertainty, but IL caught at the desperate idea as all&#xD;
that remained to me.&#xD;
"Circumstances favored me. Her parents were at their&#xD;
residence in the country; but she was at a small town&#xD;
at the~ distance of a day's journey from them, with some&#xD;
friends. II hastened to her; I urged my plan, and, to my&#xD;
delighted surprise, she yielded at once. By nature the&#xD;
gentlest of human. beings, she was not less just. She&#xD;
had never opposed her father in her life; but a sense of&#xD;
my wrongs inspired her with a courage nothing else&#xD;
could have done., Every thing was arranged. The place&#xD;
and the hour for the ceremony were appointed; the car-&#xD;
riage, a few paces off, awaited her, to which I was se-&#xD;
cretly to ~onduct~ her; and my feet almost at the thresh-&#xD;
old, when intelligence arrived of the alarming illness of&#xD;
her another and directions for her immediate return&#xD;
ho~ne. IL entered the house just in time to support her,&#xD;
as she fell nearly fainting in my arms.&#xD;
"As soon as she could speak she renounced our purpose.&#xD;
This was to be expected; but to my entreaty that, though&#xD;
I could not now ask her to accompany me, she would&#xD;
consent to a secret marriage, she was equally inflexible.&#xD;
She was to go at an early hour the next morning, and&#xD;
all IL could obtain was permission to see her once again~&#xD;
before she went. ILate :~fl the same evening we met.&#xD;
What a meeting! what a parting! Again and again we&#xD;
renewed our protestations of love, our vows of fidelity,&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT TH~ PAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
173&#xD;
&#xD;
our determination to abide resolutely and hopefully the&#xD;
chances that might yet favor our union. With clasped&#xD;
hands we called on heaven to ratify these vows and,&#xD;
placing on her finger the marriage-ring with which I had&#xD;
prepared myself, in expectation of the ceremony so cru-&#xD;
elly interrupted, I called her by the sacred name of w~fr!&#xD;
There was nothing wanting to the solemnity of our com-&#xD;
pact but the few prescribed forms and the presence of&#xD;
witnesses. In place of these were the sanctions of our&#xD;
prayers, and, as we doubted not, the approval of God.&#xD;
We parted-she to the death-bed of her mother, I to the&#xD;
ship which soon bore me over waters far less troubled&#xD;
than those that passed over my soul.&#xD;
"But IL must not dwell on this. I had many difficulties&#xD;
to encounter in the settlement of my aunt's affairs, but,&#xD;
finally, the comfort of greatly aiding her. In the mean&#xD;
time 'no tidings reached me from America. At length&#xD;
tl~iey came, and hope departed. Mary arrived in time to&#xD;
receive her mother's blessing, but so accompanied as to&#xD;
render it a curse to me. She had been a devoted wife&#xD;
and an affectionate mother, with one fatal mistake. Mar-&#xD;
ried to a man of strong will and vehement passions, she&#xD;
conceived that the only way to secure domestic happi-&#xD;
ness was in an unreserved submission to him. This she&#xD;
had perfectly practiced, and his idolizing affection had&#xD;
rewarded the sacrifice she made. Notwithstanding,&#xD;
therefore, her, sympathy with us, she had ventured no&#xD;
opposition to him, believing such to be the best way&#xD;
of finally obtaining his consent; and now, as ~a last in-&#xD;
junction, to secure her daughter's happiness, as well as&#xD;
the tranquillity of her ,husband, she required of her a&#xD;
solemn promise never ~o marry me but with his appro-&#xD;
batiori. How could she refuse? Her mother's life&#xD;
seemed suspended on a breath, that at the least agitation&#xD;
might cease forever. She promised, though with a&#xD;

&#xD;
dreadful foreboding of the consequences. This was the&#xD;
purport of the first letter I received.&#xD;
+12 'instantly wrote to a mutual friend, inclosing letters&#xD;
to Mary and her father. To herself I asserted my claim,&#xD;
registered in heaven; to her' father I said every thing I&#xD;
could, consistent with~ honor. My letter to Mary was&#xD;
never answeTed'-perhaps never received. That to her&#xD;
fatherwas returned unopened.&#xD;
"In the state of mind thus induced, my health suffered&#xD;
to such a degree that~a milder climate was imperatively&#xD;
prescribed. I obeyed, rather from utter indifference to&#xD;
place than a wish for life. Though writing continually&#xD;
to America, I received no letters. At length one reached&#xD;
me at Nice, advising me to return, in order to prevent&#xD;
the confiscation of my property, which might be averted&#xD;
if I were actually on the: spot; but if not, I should be&#xD;
classed among the refugee Tories. As I was not such, in&#xD;
fact, and as my property might be of use to others, if&#xD;
little valued by myself; I obeyed the suggestion of my&#xD;
friend. On my arrival I made one more effort to coni-&#xD;
municate with ~Mary. Her answe~ the last letter I ev~r&#xD;
received' ~-from her, was to entreat me to forget her, to&#xD;
consider every promise that bound me to her as void&#xD;
and to seek in another union a compensation for the&#xD;
suffering she :had caused me.&#xD;
"My property. was saved to me, much more through&#xD;
the efforts ~f my friends than my own. But I felt my-&#xD;
self a stranger and alone. Those I had left had formed&#xD;
other interests, based on mutual dangers and political&#xD;
sympathies, in whichihad 'little part. With nothing to&#xD;
hope or to exijoy, Ifell into a morbid condition. Yet, I&#xD;
thank God, though my social nature was disturbed, it&#xD;
wa~ not embittered. I still loved my kind, and enter-&#xD;
tained vague purposes of doing them good. But, cx-&#xD;
eluded -by the' state of things from the Practjce of my&#xD;
&#xD;
profession-the law, to which I had been bred-~-disgust-&#xD;
ed with the rivalry, political animosities, and jarring ci.&#xD;
events that war excited, I fled to the country; the wild-&#xD;
er and more remote, the more quiet I promised myself.&#xD;
Accident determined me to Ashton. I had been pass.&#xD;
ing a few weeks in this house, when ~I found that its&#xD;
owner, much embarrassed by the times, wished to dis-&#xD;
pose of it as the only means of extrication. Bat pur-&#xD;
chasers were rare. Every one was poor or in debt.&#xD;
He offered it to me, and I took it at his own price,&#xD;
mainly to relieve him. When my own, however, it&#xD;
began to have attractions. I put it in such order as&#xD;
was necessary for comfort, ordered my books-rny only&#xD;
friends-to meet me, and established them in the ac-&#xD;
commodations I had prepared for them. Surrounded&#xD;
by these, undisturbed by: the oui~er world, at peace with&#xD;
my neighbors, a sort of dull content crept over me, un-&#xD;
der which I should have stagnated but for you, or rush-&#xD;
ed in search of some more potent Lethe. But you came&#xD;
unsought, at first unwelcome, and, with you, an object&#xD;
and an Qcdupation were provided for me by Him who&#xD;
was better to me than I deserved.&#xD;
"And now, my dear Walter, will you 'extract the&#xD;
moral, or must I point it? 'Tis best that I should do&#xD;
so, lest your partiality obscure your perception. I have,&#xD;
I trust, led a harmless life; perhaps, in some instances,&#xD;
as in your own, have done good when it was thrust&#xD;
upon me. But I look back with contrition to my wasted&#xD;
prime, my objectless life, my idolatrous worship of an&#xD;
idea. I do not mean that I rebuke myself for the' fidel-&#xD;
ity, the pertinacity of my affection. I was made so. I&#xD;
could love but ohee and forever. And I declare to you,&#xD;
though you will perhaps deem it the fond confession of&#xD;
an old man, that 12 am unconscious at this moment of&#xD;
any diminution of iriy early love. I could no more sep.&#xD;

ofsmeeting her in the, heaven to which she belongs is the&#xD;
animating thought of my life. But this hope ought soon-&#xD;
er to have taught me submission. ~&#xD;
"Learn thus much from my experience-to allow no&#xD;
passion, however right in itself; to become inordinate.&#xD;
Be resolute for yourself;. be mindful of others. We&#xD;
may suffer much with little benefit; but 'what we do is&#xD;
ours.' 'I would not, my dear Walter, impertinently pry&#xD;
into your feelings; but I require not to be told that you&#xD;
are unhappy, and I, in some sort, divine the cause. Be&#xD;
true to your convictions of duty, and you will regaint&#xD;
your tranquillity.                        E. G."&#xD;
Walter dropped his head on his hands as he concluded,&#xD;
and was 'some moments absorbed in the feelings the nar-&#xD;
rative had excited. '&#xD;
"Dear, excellent Mr. G-rafton !" he at length exclaim-'.&#xD;
ed;- "how strict to himself, how forbearing to others!&#xD;
D~amie, .then, was right. She, with her simple experi-~&#xD;
ence, had discovered what I, in my happy ignorance,&#xD;
could not believ . And Mary, that star of-his life, has&#xD;
set to him, tyris in heaven. Dead! dead ! oh, what a&#xD;
word to connec with one so lovely and beloved! Yes,&#xD;
I will be strong, if only to reward the effort he has made&#xD;
to 'make me so. .If I have beenl'weak, I will not be&#xD;
worse." And he tried to believe he was not selfish;&#xD;
that, putting aside his personal interests, he desired only&#xD;
the progress and happiness of her he loved; that he&#xD;
could submit to the impassable barrier that separated&#xD;
thmifanrd hton         gifted might~ at fal  the&#xD;

-Along the shallow whirl that Folly leads,'&#xD;
'and "harden down to coarse realities."&#xD;
Walter's first impulse was to open his heart to his&#xD;
guardian, but delicacy to Eleanor forbade. His manner,&#xD;
however, when next they met? sufficiently expressed his&#xD;
gratitude, and the consolation of increased sympathy was&#xD;
felt by both.&#xD;
His next care was to- satisfy Mr.- Grafton that he was&#xD;
not so purposeless as he had appeared. He could, though&#xD;
not with all the advantage desired, pursue 'at Ashton the&#xD;
course of legal study he had already commenced, during&#xD;
his leisure hours, while in Mr. Meredith's family. It was&#xD;
something, ifa not all he could wish, toward the end he&#xD;
had long proposed to himself.&#xD;
Mr. Grafton received the suggestion with much satis-~&#xD;
faction; and in a few days Walter was regularly enter-&#xD;
ed as a clerk in the office of Mr. Barton, a lawyer recent-&#xD;
ly established in Ashton, and occupying the place of his&#xD;
old friend, Squire Whiing, hut with a larger practice.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
~oi~s indispositions had been no pretense. Even&#xD;
in such a strait she coukt not have resorted to an un-&#xD;
truth; The shock, when told by her mother of Walter's&#xD;
imrneLliate departure, was softened to her by the convic-&#xD;
tion of his honorable motives for thus withdrawing hjm9&#xD;
self, and by the delicacy that~spared suffering and embar-&#xD;
rassment to herself., But though she considered all right&#xD;
t1a~t he should d9, nature could, not be so passive. Agi~&#xD;
tation arid' ~ist~ss were followed by a sleepless night;&#xD;
and the next day fever appeared sufficient to excite the&#xD;
anxiety of her parents, though pronounced slight by her&#xD;
physician. For eight &amp;amp;r te~i days it hung about her,' re-&#xD;
ducing her color and Iksh, and then gradually passed&#xD;
a~ay; having brought with it, however, a compensation&#xD;
-it 'had saved her from observation when she could&#xD;
least have endured it. The cause remained unsuspected.&#xD;
Her intercourse with her mother, though afi~ctionate,&#xD;
was not familiar. *She shrank, therefore, from the con-&#xD;
fidence which she at the same time desired, and was rec-&#xD;
onciled to the omission only by the reflection that she&#xD;
could not make disclosures without involving Walter in&#xD;
unjust suspicions. Fortunately, while thus denying her-&#xD;
self the advice of her best friend, she had no dangerous&#xD;
intimacy with any girl of her own age, into whose sym-&#xD;
path~tic ear she could pour her young grief; and tlkreby&#xD;
strengthen an impression she felt she must resist. She&#xD;
was left, if unaided, at least not ill-advised.&#xD;
Captain Talbot was not slow in renewing his visits.&#xD;
She would gladly have avoided him. He recalled all&#xD;
that was most painful to her, but his tact soon relieved&#xD;

he said, she had generously softened her rejection, he&#xD;
next contrived so to treat the matter as to leave her&#xD;
quite in doubt wheth~ he, too,~ had not been practicing&#xD;
on her credulity; thus giving to the whole affair so much&#xD;
the air of ~ jest, that she involuntarily fell back into her&#xD;
former natural and unsuspecting feeling toward him;&#xD;
and he, resuming his unrestrained intercourse with the&#xD;
family, was able to avail himself; without alarming her,&#xD;
of every opportunity of rendering himself acceptable,&#xD;
hoping in time to become necessary.&#xD;
Perhaps a change in herself contributed to encourage&#xD;
him. From a thoughtless, laughing girl, little more than&#xD;
a child, cycry way unsuited to him, she seemed to have&#xD;
started into reflecting womanhood, capable, as he hoped,&#xD;
of better understanding, perhaps of sympathizing with&#xD;
his, mature years.&#xD;
Eleanor had, indeed, grown much older in a few&#xD;
weeks.&#xD;
"Even in a single day&#xD;
Grief hath been known to turn the young head gray."&#xD;
And, in like manner, the youthful mind is sometimes&#xD;
suddenly matured by that which stirs it deeply. Ele-&#xD;
anor had now a study that reacted immediately on her.&#xD;
self. The contemplation of Walter's character ripened&#xD;
and confirmed her own. Instead of a girlish passion,&#xD;
the sentiment she had conceived for him became a seri-&#xD;
ous, earnest motive-his self-control, his honorable ad-&#xD;
herence to duty, rousing her latent energies and correct-&#xD;
ing the heedless impulses by which she had heretofore&#xD;
been influenced.&#xD;
A fortunate change was at this time provided for her,&#xD;
and .renders some family details necessary.&#xD;

large fortune, with many good qualities somewhat mar-&#xD;

red by strong peculiarities, had been of late years es-&#xD;
tranged from her husband, and, as a consequence, there&#xD;
ha4 been a suspension of intercourse between their fam-&#xD;
ilies.' The two gentlemen, very unlike, had unhappily&#xD;
embraced different sides in the political questions that&#xD;
agitated the country; and this, together 'with some do-&#xD;
mestic matters, had engendered a coolness, amounting&#xD;
at length to an entire rupture. Most unexpectedly,&#xD;
therei~ore, a letter arrived from Mr. Lawrence, addressed&#xD;
to his daughter, inviting a visit from Eleanor, whom he&#xD;
had not seen for several years. As a reason for her&#xD;
coming was urged the desire of her aunt Gertrude, a&#xD;
younger and i~inmarried sister of Mrs. Meredith, who&#xD;
lived with her father at his patrimonial residence on the&#xD;
North River, at what was then considered no small dis-&#xD;
tance from the city.&#xD;
Such an invitation from Mr. Lawrence was not to be&#xD;
slighted, even though pressed rather stiffly, more for&#xD;
Miss Gertrude's pleasure than his own. To Mr. and&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith it indicated a return of kindly feelings,&#xD;
and to Eleanor it offered just what they thought most&#xD;
likely to restore her health and cheerfulness. For the&#xD;
present, then all plans for tutors and teaching were laid&#xD;
aside, and nothing thought of but the best way to effect&#xD;
the proposed visit. As the invitation was limited to&#xD;
Eleanor, Mr. and Mrs. Meredith were too wise to accom-&#xD;
pany her; and it was decided to consign her to the care&#xD;
of Mammy Jenny, a negro woman who had lived with&#xD;
Mrs. Lawrence ever since her marriage, had been thc&#xD;
gitardian of her nursery, and was now afactotum resort-&#xD;
ed to on every emergency. The next thing was to as-&#xD;
certain when fJ~aptain Van Allers, commanding one of&#xD;
the three sloops that belonged to a small town near Mr.&#xD;
Lawrence, would be ~eturfling. Much to the satisfac~&#xD;
tion of all parties, he was found to be actually at Coen-&#xD;

ed to sail in three or four days. Such unlooked-for fa-&#xD;
cilities a~igured well for the expedition; and, the "after&#xD;
cabin" being engaged, a huge basket of provisions was&#xD;
made ready. Cold roast chickens, ham, pastry, eggs,&#xD;
tea, coffee, cakes, bread, butter, etc., it being understood&#xD;
that the captain's table in ~the "forward cabin" would&#xD;
not be the thing for a young lady; and the length of the&#xD;
voyage was' uncertain - it might be a week, or even&#xD;
more; people had been known to be ten, even twelve&#xD;
days between New York and Albany.&#xD;
At length the sailing day came, and, intrusted to the&#xD;
faithful Mammy Jenny, and with every assurance from&#xD;
the long-known and reliable Captain Van Allers, she was&#xD;
left on board the "Fair Polly" in the evening of a fine&#xD;
day, and with every prospect of a pleasant trip. But the&#xD;
light wind in their favor " went down with the ~&#xD;
and was succeeded by one so decidedly adverse that&#xD;
they were soon compelled to "drop anchor." To sail-&#xD;
ors so inexperienced as Eleanor and her attendant, their&#xD;
situation soon became tearful, aggravated as it was by&#xD;
the intense darkness and the increasing gale. To the&#xD;
uproar of the wind succeeded new and strange sounds.&#xD;
The vessel appeared in commotion. There were feet&#xD;
hurrying to and fro, confused voices, rattling of ropes,&#xD;
lowering of the boat, and haste, if not alarm. No one&#xD;
entered, and at length Mammy Jenny ventured forth to&#xD;
inquire.&#xD;
She soon returned, accompanied by the captain. "No&#xD;
accident to themselves, but a sloop was capsized near&#xD;
them," as he said, "owing to the folly of a raw captain&#xD;
and an obstinate helmsman. They had been such dun-&#xD;
derheads as to tack with a wind 'dead ahead,' and 'no&#xD;
ballast;' and they were now where they ought to be,&#xD;
'on their beam-ends."' The few passengers had gone&#xD;

"Fair Polly," and for whom the captain requested ac-&#xD;
'c~mmodation in the after cabiii.&#xD;
This, under the circumstances; could not be refused;&#xD;
and, just as Eleanor had compassionately assented, she&#xD;
was startled by the entrance of a singularly-attired and&#xD;
vulgar-looking woman, with *her arms full of boxes and&#xD;
parcels. Mammy Jenny cast a dubious eye on the in-&#xD;
trucPr, but Eleanor kindly helped to accommodate her&#xD;
numerous packages.&#xD;
She soon made herself known-a New England worn-&#xD;
an, who with the enterprise of her people, had establish-&#xD;
ed herself. as a milliner at one of the "landings," and&#xD;
who was now returning from New York with an assort-&#xD;
ment of articles in her line.&#xD;
At this time the great Yankee nation was slowly in-&#xD;
sinuating itself within the boundaries of their Dutch&#xD;
neighbors, who,' with much the same enlarged policy as&#xD;
induced their countrymen to burn their spice-groves in&#xD;
India, regarded the interlopers with distrust and jeal-&#xD;
ousy. Even among those who ought to have known&#xD;
better,  prejudice often     eight, and "Vnnkee,"&#xD;
the             had its w&#xD;
with many, was but another name for rogifery, vulgar-&#xD;
ity, and conceit.&#xD;
But, in spite of ill-will and misconstruction, they came&#xD;
and conquered. Not, indeed, in the manner of their&#xD;
progenitors, the sea-kings of old, in their descents on&#xD;
the too-confiding Britons, but with arms quite as effect-&#xD;
ive-their heads' and 'hands. There was " no device nor&#xD;
knowledge" in which they did not excel, no invention&#xD;
nor haiidicraft which they, did not originate or success-&#xD;
fully apply, until they "entered into the land to pos-&#xD;
sess it"&#xD;
The young woman now in~oduced into Eleanor's ex-&#xD;
clusive cabin was no bad specimen of the driving and&#xD;

thriving ingenuity by which her people, however dis-&#xD;
liked,, were making themselves knoWn and necessary.&#xD;
She had, like the rest, evidently inserted an "entering&#xD;
wedge," and felt all the importance which belongs to&#xD;
persons of her occupation in a village where, as usual,&#xD;
women wePt the majority. The accident furnished a&#xD;
theme for her accustomed loquacity,, and she did not&#xD;
long restrain .the wrath and disgust it excited.&#xD;
"A' pretty mess they'd make on't. Never heard of&#xD;
such doings in Nantucket. 'Tried, be sure, to excuse it&#xD;
-putten' it ~on the new sloop, and the stiff; onhandy&#xD;
riggiri'! Guess they had as many new sloops at Nan-&#xD;
tucket as at iRed Hook. Never heard afore that any&#xD;
craft was better for bein' old!' Spun' people's goods&#xD;
and disapp'intin' customers!. Dare say this 'ere hat,"&#xD;
taking off,, as she spoke, a remarkably inappropriate one&#xD;
of white satin trimmed with a profusion' of ribbon,&#xD;
flowers, and feathers," d~ire say it's all beat in with that&#xD;

but I guess I can 'fix it somehow. Well! how they did&#xD;
pull me out of them cabin windows' into the boat-me&#xD;
and my things; for I wouldn't stir without them, I tell&#xD;
you."&#xD;
Eleanor listened in mute astonishment to this entirely&#xD;
new sample of womankind; and Mammy Jenny, who&#xD;
had risen respectfully on her entrance, reseated~,herseli&#xD;
with ~ instinctive conviction that she was not entitled&#xD;
to' any such demonstration. But the new-corner pro-&#xD;
ceeded to adjust herself in her quarters as if they were.&#xD;
entirely her own; and, after giving sundry twists~ and&#xD;
turns to the misused hat, pronounced it "none the&#xD;
worse;" Then, pinning it up to a nail in the cabin, she&#xD;
covered it with a handkerchief and said, complacently,&#xD;
"There! 'if that isn't a first-rate bride's hat, I should like&#xD;
to know where you'd find one. I guess Catliny Van'&#xD;

siderin'," with a smile; "but who'd ever have thought&#xD;
of bein' upset? 'Tis nice pattern, too, and I sha'n't&#xD;
turn my back on any one for copyin~ after it."&#xD;
Eleanor thought she should little relish such a han..&#xD;
selliiig of her wedding-hat.&#xD;
About midnight a bustling movement announced a&#xD;
change. The wind had veered sb many points that&#xD;
preparations were making for tacking, and then began&#xD;
the horrors of the voyage. The misery of sea-sickness&#xD;
has been too often felt to need any special notice here,&#xD;
but if it be doubted that it could be experienced in any&#xD;
great degree under such circumstances, let those who&#xD;
have known our sloop navigation answer.&#xD;
Eleanor could not raise her head; Ma Jenny&#xD;
turned despairing and helpless looks toward her "young&#xD;
missis ;" the milliner's powers of speech were limited to&#xD;
scarce articulate lamentations, and the wedding-hat, toss-&#xD;
ed from its moorings on the wall, fell to the floor without&#xD;
a hand raised to its rescue.&#xD;
"If it goes to Jericho," exclaimed its disconsolate&#xD;
owner, "I can't stop it."&#xD;
Toward midday the wind lulled into nearly a calm,&#xD;
and, with relief came thoughts of food. Mammy Jenny&#xD;
bestirred herself to prepare it, and, companionship in&#xD;
misery removing barriers, she suggested to Eleanor to&#xD;
offer some to "the milliner woman," who did not appear&#xD;
provided with any private comforts of that sort. It was&#xD;
gladly accepted, and, as excitement naturally follows re-&#xD;
lief she repaid their kindness in volubility.&#xD;
"Hadn't she heard of Mr. Lawrence I Yes, indeed.&#xD;

counts, the proudest. Proud as Nebuchadnezzar, and a&#xD;
perfect tyrant! But then his daughter was a saint, and&#xD;
'Master Phil,' as they called him, the greatest shot in all&#xD;
these parts. A likely young man, too, they said-not&#xD;
near sY overbearing' as his grandfather." And so onto&#xD;
the great indignation of Mammy Jenny, who wondered&#xD;
at her "imperrence !" and not a little to the alarm of&#xD;
Eleanor, who, accustomed to hear her grandfather spoken&#xD;
of only with respect, was quite unprepared for this view&#xD;
of his character.&#xD;
What wind there was n~w favored them, but their&#xD;
progress was slow, with the prospect of anchoring again&#xD;
at ebb tide. Novelty, however, had its charm, and Ele-&#xD;
anor rejoiced in the opportunity thus afforded of better&#xD;
seeing the objects presented to her. Seated on deck, or&#xD;
walking, her faithful attendant always at hand to warn&#xD;
her of the shifting boom or a rope that might entrap&#xD;
her, she surrendered herself to this new experience, now&#xD;
directing her gaze to the varying shore, now watching&#xD;
the working of the sloop; then leaning over the stern to&#xD;
amuse herself with the apparent efforts of the little boat&#xD;
behind to' keep up with thefri, and then measuring with&#xD;
her eye the wake of its keel. 'The river, clear, unruf-&#xD;
fled, majestic in its serenity as in size, widening into in-&#xD;
land seas, and 'then insintiating 'itself between the ap-&#xD;
proaching and apparently interlocking shores, mocking&#xD;
the eye with the semblance of a lake, its bold headlands,&#xD;
its far-stretching 'points, its margin now rising into&#xD;
mountains, now descending in grassy %lopes, furnished&#xD;
her incessant variety and delight.&#xD;

West Point, saddened even to his enem5es by the mem~&#xD;
ory of the unfortunate Andre; Anthony's Nose, then&#xD;
perfect, but since snubbed by modern improvement;&#xD;
Sugar Loaf and Turk's Face, were pointed out to her by&#xD;
the captain with the pride of a river skipper. So on&#xD;
they rather floated than sailed, the day genial, the skies&#xD;
beautiful, till they emerged from the strait at Newburgh.&#xD;
Here~ as the wind had failed altogether, and the tide&#xD;
was against them, they. cast anchor in face of the Grand&#xD;
Sachem, the river again expanding before them, and its&#xD;
course traceable for many miles, studded with ~loops&#xD;
and schooners, which, like themselves, had left the wind&#xD;
caged in the Highland recesses in their rear.&#xD;
Over all were beauty and tranquillity. Then were no&#xD;
steam-boats, terrifying the ignorant Dutch negroes with&#xD;
the belief of the coming, of the Evil One in a car driven&#xD;
on the water by a dragon vomiting smoke and flame.&#xD;
Nor was unhappy Echo then compelled to repeat the&#xD;
shriek of a locomotive as it rushed through rocks, leap-&#xD;
ed over creeks, dived into mountain depths, dashed&#xD;
througj~the humble garden of the cottage, or rudely&#xD;
invaded aristocratic parks. The march of improvement&#xD;
had not begun.&#xD;
Another 1nigb~t succeeded, with little progress; but&#xD;
toward morning a favorable breeze sprung up, and&#xD;
* every one was astir. Elear~or, having breakfasted, re-&#xD;
sumed her s~tion on deck. All sails were set, the&#xD;
waves raced after thern~ and the little boat in the rear&#xD;
bounded, as if endowed with life, over the foam that&#xD;
crested its tiny prow. Eleanor caught the spirit of the&#xD;
change; and laughed aloud from 'the excitement.&#xD;
The Catskills, which the day before had but dimly&#xD;
blended with the far horizon, now came forth blue and&#xD;
distinct, 7but with ever-varying tints as their fleecy dra~.&#xD;
series waved about them. If they were, as Las been&#xD;
&#xD;
fabled, a treasure-house of storms and sunshine, they&#xD;
now only let out the last, and appeared to Eleanor a&#xD;
lovely cloud-land, where ~nly good and 'beneficent&#xD;
spirits dwelt. And, if legends may 'be believed, they&#xD;
had vindicated their claim to be thus considered by de-&#xD;
feating all attempts to extract from the mountains com-&#xD;
mitted to their guardianship the root of all evil-gold&#xD;
and silver.&#xD;
Borne along, like Psyche, by the zephyrs, Eleanor,&#xD;
late in the afternoon of the third day-a remarkably&#xD;
short passage-was requested to look at a certain "land-&#xD;
ing," near which,' on a bank that 'overhung it, was the&#xD;
residence of her grandfather, but so emboxvered in trees&#xD;
that it was not discernible at her then distance. They&#xD;
approached the dock, and, as Eleanor and the old nurse&#xD;
disembarked, a troop of little colored children, evident-&#xD;
ly on the look-out fQr ther~, collected, with a courtesy&#xD;
to "young missis," and a 'hearty' welcome to Mammy&#xD;
Jenny. Others, as soon as the sloop gave signs of near-&#xD;
ing the dock, had started off on a brisk trot up a precip-&#xD;
itous ascent, tumbling each other over in their haste&#xD;
to be the first to announce the arrival.&#xD;
By the time that every thing was landed, was seen&#xD;
descending by a winding road, through a fine wood, a&#xD;
carriage, into, which, with many bows from the gray-&#xD;
headed colored coachman, Eleanor, her attendant, and&#xD;
her luggage were bestowed; and, while it is pursuing&#xD;
the long and circuitous ascent of the carriage-drive, it&#xD;
may be well to introduce both master and mansion more&#xD;
particularly to the reader.&#xD;
The house had been built by Mr. Lawrence's father&#xD;
for the reception of his bride. With the uxoriousness&#xD;
that marked a family of whom a witty friend had said&#xD;
that "if a Lawrence married a broomstick he would&#xD;
love it," every thing had been, done to honor his young&#xD;

derland, he fondly called her his "Guelder iRose ;" and,&#xD;
with the same feeling, he gave to their new residence&#xD;
the name of "IRosenberg"'-.---Anglice, "Rose-hill ;" to&#xD;
Tender which the more appropriate, the grounds were&#xD;

The memory of these was still preserved in their vigor-&#xD;

The house was constructed of brick brought from&#xD;
- Holland. The year of its erection, inserted in the fa-&#xD;
9ade in large irorN characters, announced a respectable&#xD;
antiquity for a colonial residence. Two crow-stepped&#xD;
gables, one' with a finial and weather-cock, presented&#xD;
themselves as the front entrance, while every imagina-&#xD;
ble variety of outline prepared the observer for its inte-&#xD;
rior irregularities. Windows of every size, without&#xD;
symmetry in form or relation -to each other, were thrust&#xD;
through its walls, with here and there little projections,&#xD;
neither dormer nor oriel, adding t6~its grotesque yet not&#xD;
unpicturesque architecture. On entering, a hall of mod-&#xD;
erate dimensions received the visitor, which, at its ter-&#xD;
mination, expanded into what was called in Dutch do-&#xD;
mestic parlance a por(aa4 a word susceptible of various&#xD;
applications as portal, entry, or lobby.~ This last w~s&#xD;
its signification in the present instance. It had a win-&#xD;
dow, and an outside door divided in the centre horizon-&#xD;
tally. By this was entered an af-daic, literally a "pro-&#xD;
jecting roof;" but freely applied, as in this instance, to&#xD;
the place so sheltered, and well rendered by the En-&#xD;
glish term "lean-to." Here were to be seen guns, pow-&#xD;
der-horns, fishing-tackle, fishing-boots, and weather-dc-&#xD;
fying coats, the Mackintoshes of the day. A short&#xD;
flight of steps descended from this to 'the ground.&#xD;
In the podaal terminated a1~darge heaAry staircase, be-&#xD;
neath which a narrow one, da~ as Avernus, gave an em.&#xD;
&#xD;
[&#xD;
&#xD;
trance to the regions below. Into this part of the hail&#xD;
opened doors from two of the principal rooms on the first&#xD;
floor, in passing through which it was especially well to&#xD;
be heedful, for there were almost as many levels as rooms.&#xD;
These were small, badly lighted,- with deep window re-&#xD;
cesses, cushioned, and serving as seats; ceilings wooden,&#xD;
painted, end- so low that a tall man would instinctively&#xD;
- stoop on entering; with- heavy beams, in some of the&#xD;
rooms carved; large, deep fireplaces, the jambs and fronts&#xD;
ornamented with tiles of coarse blue and white pottery,&#xD;
illustrating Scripture incidents-the history of Moses, of&#xD;
Joseph, the Prodigal Son, etc.-thus, with pious intent,&#xD;
associating with the /sacred fire of the domestic hearth&#xD;
the teachings of Holy Writ.&#xD;
The furniture was of black walnut: straight, high-&#xD;
backed, heavy chairs, their seats covered with worsted&#xD;
of divers colors, wrought in tent-stitch. In the dining-&#xD;
room a slab of the same woo~Ii served as the sideboard,&#xD;
and was laden with silver, massy, and richly-wrought.&#xD;
The carpets were what was called "ingrain," woven in&#xD;
one piece, with small figures on a dark ground, and sur-&#xD;
rounded by a border. These were never allowed to ex-&#xD;
tend beneath the chairs or other furniture ranged against&#xD;
the walls, but wei~e, in accordance with Dutch notions&#xD;
of neatness, taken up every week, and the floQr kept so&#xD;
white and clean, that the portion of it seen was at once&#xD;
the pride and the test of the housekeeping.&#xD;
Dutch habits, indeed, pervaded the household. Like&#xD;
many other colonists, Mr. Lawrence was of English ex-&#xD;
traction, but his ancestors, by intermarriage with Dutch&#xD;
families, had ingrafted their tastes and customs on the&#xD;
original stock. These he adhered to with much perti-&#xD;

seventy-three years of age. A close examinationn of the&#xD;

although, not generally slow to enforce his rights, he&#xD;
magnanimously overlooked them in this inst~ince; and&#xD;
if people, misled by his vigor and good looks, gave him&#xD;
less than his due, 'he submitted. Yet, somewhat incon-&#xD;
sistently-but who is consistent ?-.---he persisted in a style&#xD;
of dress at least ten or twelve years anterior to the then&#xD;
period. Here, however, an antagonistic principle was&#xD;
in force. " He would not be dictated to by man-milli-&#xD;
ners and upholsterers. His person and his house should&#xD;
be 'clothed as he, not as they chose." Accordingly, in&#xD;
this, as in all things, a practical c~ponent of' the "Dec-&#xD;
laration of Independence," his furniture remained un-&#xD;
changed, and he continued to wear coats whose defi-&#xD;
ciency of collars was compensated by~ immense cuffs,&#xD;
waistcoats with deep pockets, a stock, the diamond'buckle&#xD;
of which was displayed above his coat, costly knee and&#xD;
shoe buckles, powder, and a cue.&#xD;
It must be allowed that' in this his good taste was as&#xD;
conspicuous as his obstinacy. No style would have sat&#xD;
so well upon him. He had, indeed, an eye for beauty&#xD;
seldom at 'fault often attaching to it a false value;~ for&#xD;
though, as he thought, an; aristocratic distinctioi~i of ri~flit,&#xD;

blessed with handsome children~ Heaven knows what&#xD;
* he would have done to them had they been ugly!&#xD;
Yet he was not a vain man. Well convinced of'his&#xD;
advantages of whatever kind, and protici as "the son&#xD;

cifu.l to them, in old ag~e caring for them. Yet the wife&#xD;
of his bosom? the dearest object of his affection, and'his&#xD;
children, were not infrequently sufferers from his pe-&#xD;
culiarities.&#xD;
An aristocrat in taste, he was nevertheless a democrat&#xD;
by profession. Nor was this as unaccountable as it might&#xD;
appear. His nature was essentially humane, his temper&#xD;
imperious. Hence, reversing the laws of optics, objects&#xD;
seen at a distance preserved to him their true size and&#xD;
proportions. It was only when they approached so near&#xD;
as to affect him personally that they were exaggerated&#xD;
and distorted. He could admit the claims of the whole&#xD;
human family, but not the rights of his own.&#xD;
The carriage, having ascended' the hill,'turned, and,&#xD;
proceeding through a long avenue of trees, approached&#xD;
the entrance. Here appeared negrdes of every age, from&#xD;
"wee toddlin' things" of two or three years to an old&#xD;
Guine~a negress. The younger ones 'slyly peeped 'from&#xD;
behind the projections of the house and kitchen-an ad-&#xD;
jacent building-or from the cellar rooms. ,The elder&#xD;
ones approached with courtesies, and demonstrations of&#xD;
welcome. One young fellow,' evidently an aspirant to&#xD;
gentility, elbowed the rest aside, let down the steps, and&#xD;
with a scrape that brought his 'head' nearly to the ground,&#xD;
expressed his high satisfaction.&#xD;

conducted Eleanor by his master's orders; and having,&#xD;
with a flourish suitable to the occasion, opened the door&#xD;
and seen her in, closed it and retired. The first person&#xD;
she saw on entering was one whose image, left on her&#xD;
childhood, had never been forgotten, and which, though&#xD;
altered by intervening years, still corresponded to the&#xD;
original impression. Eleanor rushed into the arms that&#xD;
ope~aed to receive her, exclaiming, "Dear Aunt Ger-&#xD;
trude !" Her aunt's 'eyes were more eloquent than&#xD;
speech. Pressing her tenderly to her heart? she whis-&#xD;
pered, "Your grandfather 1" and Eleanor comprehended&#xD;
the omission. Advancing a few steps, she saw a very&#xD;
fine-looking old gentleman in an arm-chair, habited in a&#xD;
light ray camlet dressing-gown, lined with silk of the&#xD;
e color, and wearing a white cotton cap, not very&#xD;
long since ~occasionally worn by elderly gentlemen be-&#xD;
fore making their dinner toilets. The inadvertence that&#xD;
disturbed Eleanor he was too happy to notice. Taking&#xD;
both her hands as she approached him, he kissed her on&#xD;
her lips and forehead, and said, in a softened voice,&#xD;
"God bless you, my child !" Then, with a polite for-&#xD;
mality, he inquired for "Mr. and Mrs. Meredith," and&#xD;
then fo1r particulars ~f her voyage.&#xD;
These inquiries answered, he desired her to place her&#xD;
chair by his side, and gazed at her with much satisfac-&#xD;
tion; looking into her eyes as if he would read them;&#xD;
surveying her minutely as she sat; then, taking her hand,&#xD;
he directed her to rise, measured her height attentively,&#xD;
told her to show him her feet, and, in a sort of soliloquy,&#xD;
broke forth:&#xD;
"Just such eyes as mammcttje's!"-a Dutch diminutive&#xD;
for mamm~, often fondly applied by him to his wife-&#xD;
"just s, ~eyes! No one 'could ever tell their color,&#xD;
but no ~ er forgot them. Her height too! just such&#xD;
falling shoulders I her round waist too I AhI yes; and&#xD;

herhands too l"-turning andexatnining them ashe spoke&#xD;
-" and her feet, which one can tell by a glance are pret-&#xD;
tier without shoe and stocking! Yes, mammatje brought&#xD;
all these into the family. Do you love to dance, child ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"To be sure you do; your feet were made to chance,&#xD;
as much as birds' wings tQ fly. So did she; and danced&#xD;
away my heart the first time I saw her." Then, look-&#xD;
ing at her fingers one by one, he continued, "Do you&#xD;
play on the spinet? I have just had a man from New&#xD;
York to put your aunt's iu order for you."&#xD;
Eleanor replied in the affirmative.&#xD;
"And sing ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Ah! yes, yes, I see you are mamma~je's child"...-in&#xD;
a tender voice-~" more like her, even, than Gitty, who&#xD;
was always called her image."&#xD;
Then, with a deep sigh, he bade her resume her seat.&#xD;
"I hope you will be happy here, my child ~ Aunt Git-&#xD;
ty isn't very lively, but she is very good; and J-i am&#xD;
neither lively nor good, but I feel that .1 shall lo'v~e ou&#xD;
very much; and Cousin Phil, he will mak9 up what-&#xD;
ever we lack. By the way, Gitty, where is~hilip? lie&#xD;
ought to be here."&#xD;
Miss Lawrence, who had not withdrawn her admiring&#xD;
and loving gaze from her niece since she had entered,&#xD;
but had been silent from respect to her father, replied,&#xD;
"You know, sir, he could not be sure that' his cousin&#xD;
would come to-day,. aiid he is off sporting, I be~e~e,~for&#xD;
I heard him call the dogs."&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence frowned.&#xD;
"lie should have remained here, like a gentleman on&#xD;
duty, to receive her.whenever she might come. But he&#xD;
is a good fellow, Eleanor~ and will be a merry compan..&#xD;
ion for you. Do you remember him;'at all ?"~&#xD;

"Very little, sir. I can only just recollect him as a&#xD;
boy, terrifying me by pointing a gun at me."&#xD;
~" The rascal! the young rascal 1" exclaimed Mr. Law-&#xD;
ren~ee. "But now1 in vengeance~ ray pretty Nelly, you&#xD;
shall point your eyes at him-much better ordnance, I&#xD;
can tell you, than his gun."&#xD;
The tea-hour, an early one, had passed, and Eleanor,&#xD;
having declined all refreshment, withdrew with her aunt&#xD;
to the apartment assigned her. This consisted of two&#xD;
rooms; one, her bedroom, commanding a view of the&#xD;
river;* the other, in its rear, and communicating with&#xD;
it, combined the conveniences of dressing-room and li-&#xD;
brary. Here a large kass (Anglice, wardrobe) of black&#xD;
walnut, supported by immense balls, with its heavy cor-&#xD;
nice, ext ~nded to the low ceiling. Its two folding doors,&#xD;
richly carved, when opened, disclosed deep recesses, af-&#xD;
fording space for skirts that&#xD;
a brave expansion."&#xD;
Next in importance was a walnut bookcase, the lower&#xD;
part an escritoire, on the top of which was a small plas-&#xD;
ter bust of Calvin, painted black, probably in honor of&#xD;
his cloth. Here, among many of graver character, were&#xD;
a few books placed apparently for her especial benefit:&#xD;
"Bennett's Lettex~~ to young Ladies," £t Fordyce's Ser-&#xD;
mous for young Women," "Gregory's Advice to his&#xD;
iDaughters," "Mrs. Chapone's Letters;" and, for lighter&#xD;
reading, "The religious Courtship," and "Sir Charles&#xD;
Grandison," in eight volumes.&#xD;
Then came a commode-table of ancient fashion, en~&#xD;
niched with marble and brass, and adapted to the in~&#xD;
tricate toilet of her grandmother's time. On this was&#xD;
placed a little cabinet, covered with ivory, and adorned&#xD;
with horses, trees, pagodas, men, women, and beasts, that&#xD;
certainly did not violate the commandment.&#xD;
The cavernous chimneys of both rooms were orna-&#xD;
&#xD;

melted with tiles. One of them, open to the ceiling, in-&#xD;
stead of a mantle-piece, had a chintz valance. How lire&#xD;
coul4 be safely made in such a place Eleanor might well&#xD;
wonder. The other, placed in the angle of the room,&#xD;
was curtailed in breadth, but, as a compensation, was&#xD;
furnished with a breastwork that ascended pyramidally&#xD;
to the ceiling, divided into panels and other devices de-&#xD;
signed for ornament. The tiles set forth the histories of&#xD;
Esther and Judith; and, though the Jewish heroines&#xD;
were neither as touching or niagAiilcent as when por-&#xD;
trayed by Guercino and Allori, they had, nevertheless,&#xD;
met with admiration.&#xD;
The heavy carved four-post bedstead, blackened by&#xD;
time, was surrounded by curtains on which blue and&#xD;
white shepherds and shepherdesses tended blue and&#xD;
white sheep, wove garlands of blue and white roses, and&#xD;
reposed under blue and white trees but little higher than&#xD;
themselves.&#xD;
But, if Art w~s rude, Nature, ever true to herself; was&#xD;
beautiful! The river, though seen through small and&#xD;
~ windows, was to be traced&#xD;
far-stretching north and south; and the mountains, ir-&#xD;
radiated by the declining sun, burnishing, as he receded,&#xD;
their empurpled summits&#xD;
deficieneies~        ,amply made up for all interior&#xD;
Having changed her dress, Eleanor proceeded to ad.&#xD;
just herself in her new quarters, and, this done, a sum-&#xD;
mons to supper recalled her to her friends. At the din~&#xD;
ing-room door she was met by her grandfather. lie had&#xD;
insisted on leaving his room on her account; and, tak-&#xD;
ing her hand, with apologies for his dishabille, he intro-&#xD;

much cordiality.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVITh&#xD;
ELEANOR'S rest was so profound that, much to her&#xD;
confusion, she found, on entering the parlor in the morn-&#xD;
ing, the family prayers over, and her grandfather cere-&#xD;
moniously waiting for her. Her humble apology was&#xD;
graciously received, and Miss Lawrence, to relieve her&#xD;
embarrassment, playfully called for her dream.&#xD;
"Oh, I slept to~ soundly for that; but stay! I iid&#xD;
dream something, too. Aid now I recollect- and it was&#xD;
about Cousin Philip," said Eleanor, looking archly at&#xD;
him, "and his gun, which he agai4 pointed at me, when&#xD;
suddenly it changed into a wreal4a-Jike those on the&#xD;
curtains, you know; I had been examining them just&#xD;
before II fell asleep-and, as he wound it round me, in the&#xD;
effort to escape I awoke; but I was soon fast again, and&#xD;
had forgotten it entirely."&#xD;
Her grandfather chucked her under the chin, exclaim-&#xD;
ing, "Forgot it! No, no, I don't believe that. But&#xD;
there's uo harm in a little coquetry. Tis only an agree-&#xD;
able spice, which, I dare say, you know how to use."&#xD;
Cousin Philip colored; but Eleanor attached no sig-&#xD;
nificance to that, nor to the raillery that excited it. She&#xD;
was no coquette. Indeed, so little was her tiature adapt-&#xD;
ed to affect or to conceal, that she hardly comprehended&#xD;
the word in its full extent, and replied to the -charge&#xD;
only by a smile.&#xD;
Master Philip, thus far rather unceremoniously intro~&#xD;
duced, has claims~ to a more particular notice. He was&#xD;
the orphan and only grandson of Mr. Lawrence. De-&#xD;
prived 'of his parents from infancy, he had passedhis life&#xD;

primogeniture had ceased to exist by law, it was general-&#xD;
ly~ supposed that Mr. Lawrence, in accordance with what,&#xD;
to him, would be a "higher law"-his own choice-in-&#xD;
tended to leave nearly all his large estate to him.&#xD;
Good looks were his by inheritance. To these he&#xD;
added good temper, unspoiled by his position; amiable&#xD;
manners, kindly feelings, and good natural abilities.&#xD;
These last, however; had received little cultivation. He&#xD;
had, indeed, been sent to college, for which he was in-&#xD;
differently- prepared; but, with no habits or tastes fit-&#xD;
ting him to derive advantage from it, his grandfather&#xD;
wisely deemed that the exposure to his morals was great-&#xD;
er than the benefit to his mind, and recalled him before&#xD;
the academic course was completed. Hardy and fear-&#xD;
less, his passion was country sports; and with such per-&#xD;
seycrance and success did he pursue them, that they pro-&#xD;
cured for him a reputation far more to his fancy than&#xD;
any honors a college could confer. His grandfather saw&#xD;
his deflciencie~ with a lenient eye; not so much 'from&#xD;
an overweening indulgence, as from a pride that refused&#xD;
to admit them as such.&#xD;
"Phil was a gentleman, every inch of him. Brave&#xD;
and' generous; he couldn't be otherwise; 'twas in his&#xD;
blood; he would be a good master and landlord; had no&#xD;
vk~es; what great matter if he didn't like books? like a&#xD;
young Persian, he could ride, shoot, and tell the truth;&#xD;
and that was more than some chaps could do, who were&#xD;
men before they were boys, and grew up without either&#xD;
childhood or manhood. Book-worms were not the most&#xD;
useful people in the world. No; he had found that out,&#xD;
to hi~ sorrow!"&#xD;
These and similar reflections served to reconcile the&#xD;
old gentleman to the inevitable.&#xD;
Th~breakfast over, Mr. Lawrence remained in the par-&#xD;

the door with a silver salver, on which was a silver mug&#xD;
with warm water for shaving, and stood till his master&#xD;
proceeded to his room, whither he followed. There&#xD;
the business of the toilet began. The wrapper was ex-&#xD;
changed for the "powdering gown." The shaving fin-&#xD;
ished, the hair "en pcq~l1otes" was released, pomatumed,&#xD;
frizzed, curled, and powdered, and the cue carefully en-&#xD;
twined with its black ribbon. If Mr. Lawrence intended&#xD;
to ride, he dressed accordingly; but if; as on the present&#xD;
occasion, he meant to remain within, he arranged him-&#xD;
self as if for company;' and reappeared in the dining-&#xD;
room just before one o'clock, which, as the dining hour;&#xD;
no conformity to later fashions could induce him to&#xD;
,change.&#xD;
Eleanor had come like the olive-bearing dove, and, as&#xD;
such, found access to all hearts, especially her aunt's.&#xD;
She had suffered much from the family breach, and re-&#xD;
ceived her niece with nearly a mother's love. There&#xD;
was a striking resemblance between them, from the&#xD;
likeness they both bore to the same person - Mrs.&#xD;
Lawrence. They had also much of her character, but&#xD;
different phases of it. Eleanor reproduced her; frank,&#xD;
joyous, spirited, as when, in the words of her husband,&#xD;
she had "danced away his heart ;" her daughter recall-&#xD;
ed her; when, after subduing his heart, her own~ had&#xD;
passed under the yoke. Time had dealt kindly with&#xD;
Miss Lawrence. In withdrawing some beauties, he had&#xD;
added others. lie had stolen the rose, but he had re-&#xD;
placed it with a lily so. perfect as seemed a fitter expres-&#xD;
sion of her pure spirit; and if; on her fair brow, there&#xD;
might be detected some slight&#xD;
"Lines of his antique pen,"&#xD;
they were scarcely noticed in the sweet serenity that&#xD;
ever dwelt there. 11cr smiles, if less gay and frequent,&#xD;
were more tender; and&#xD;

"Still her eyes smiled too,&#xD;
But 'twas as if remembering they had wept."&#xD;
Alit how truly 'has it been said, "Within the most&#xD;
beautiful eyes are yet fountains of tears 1"&#xD;
Notwithstanding difference of years and temperament,&#xD;
there soon appeared a happy adaptation between the&#xD;
aunt and niece. The inward peace which spoke in Miss&#xD;
Lawrence's face, hergentleness, her self-forgetfulness man-&#xD;
ifested in Constant thought for others, her patience, her&#xD;
ch~tstened cheerfulness, shed a tranquilizing influence on&#xD;
the yet excited and sore spirit 'of Eleanor, who, in turn,&#xD;
as' het feelings gradually recovered, in goo'd degree, their&#xD;
iiaturali tone, gave animation and movement to the still&#xD;
waters of Miss Lawrence's life.&#xD;
While her au~it attended to some domestic matters,&#xD;
Eleanor sought her own arni~ement; and, wandering&#xD;
into~ the drawing-room, spied the spinet that her grand-&#xD;
father' had mentioned. It was an antiquated instru.-&#xD;
merit, but had 'been costly and handsome in its time;&#xD;
and, when she touched it, she was surprised to find its&#xD;
tone so good. ~Tiirning over leaves and books of music,&#xD;
she found some which, though a little old-fashioned,&#xD;
bore testimony' to her aunt's nice taste:. Handel's "Wa-&#xD;
ter music," his much-admired "minuet in Ariadne," por-&#xD;
tion~ from other operas; and, among the songs, some&#xD;
in sentiment far excelling those that had superseded&#xD;
them: Wailer's beautiful 'lines, "Go, lovely Rose;" Ben&#xD;
Jonson's "Drink to me only with thine eyes," which&#xD;
has since been, murdered by being made "a lesson for.&#xD;
beginners ;" "The rose had been whsh'd, lately washed&#xD;
in a shower," and others of the same character.. From&#xD;
one of the books a loose leaf fell out' on which were the&#xD;
notes and words of a song in manuscript.' Her attention&#xD;
was attracted toit by an attempt to obliterate some writ-&#xD;
ing on the margin, of which only ~a date, and "sent by1".&#xD;
were visible. The song, be~nning&#xD;
&#xD;

"Whither, my Iovc-..ah !' whither art thou flown?&#xD;

&#xD;
touched a chord that vibrated in Eleanor's, then particu-&#xD;
larly sympathetic on the subject of the tender passion;&#xD;
and, her imagination excited by the idea of mystery, she&#xD;
tried, girl-luke, to solve it. The paper was yellow with'&#xD;
age, the ink pale, therefore both belonged to "long&#xD;
ago." 'It must have been sent to Aunt Gertrude in days&#xD;
of "Auld lang syne." "Yes; but had it any personal&#xD;
reference to herself, or to the giver? If not, why erase&#xD;
so carefully the name? 'Did that express displeasure, or&#xD;
desire of concealment ?" Eleanor could not satisfy her-&#xD;
self; but she felt more than ever drawn to Aunt Gertrude&#xD;
by the fantastic idea thus conjured up. She tried the&#xD;
air; it was very tender, and she readily caught it.&#xD;
When she returned to the parlor, where Miss Lawrence&#xD;
had remained, her aunt said, "You have been trying my&#xD;
long-forsaken spinet, my dear, and 'have chanced on one&#xD;
of my old songs, I perceive."&#xD;
Miss Lawrence's manner was so calm and unconscious&#xD;
that Eleanor's little castle tumbled. down.&#xD;
"Dear me!" thought she, much disappointed; "'then&#xD;
it was not a lover, after.'all !"&#xD;
No sketch of the domestic life of the period could well&#xD;
omit the humbler characters in the family drama. Ne-&#xD;
groes made then, in the State of New York, a necessary&#xD;
part of every establishment, great or small.&#xD;
The gentle race is now fast ~disappearing from the&#xD;
household. It is only occasionally that a courtesy or a&#xD;
bo~ from a gray head recalls those who nursed our in-&#xD;
fancy and guarded our childhood; who prepared, with'&#xD;
an instinct all their own, the food for the family or hos-&#xD;

to the dying, and followed the dead to their last homes,&#xD;
with a fidelity not measured by their merits-our at-&#xD;
teridants from the cradle to the grave. Surely, as s~uch,&#xD;
none will reject a passing tribute to them.&#xD;
The "vexed question" of slavery, which even then&#xD;
began to be discussed, did not yet agitate the public&#xD;
mind as it has since done. Philanthropists and patriots&#xD;
revolved schemes for solving the threatening problem,&#xD;
but most persons satisfied their convictions of duty to-&#xD;
ward their slaves by humane treatment, to which some&#xD;
added a care for their morals. Of these were Mr. Law-&#xD;
rence. They were a part of his inheritance, and he would&#xD;
have felt himself disgraced as a gentleman had he been&#xD;
a cruel 'or neglectful master. lie enforced, the marriage&#xD;
tie, punished vice, exacted no severe labor, and was con-&#xD;
siderate to sickness and infirmity. His daughter's come&#xD;
passion was more enlarged. Lamenting their ignorance,&#xD;
she tried to instruct them in reading and writing; and,&#xD;
when baffled by their inaptitude, gave time and pa-&#xD;
tience to their oral teaching. Here, too, 'she had difficul-&#xD;
ties. With no bad passions, affectionate, gentle, and, ac-&#xD;
cording to their light, faithful, their moral perceptions&#xD;
were nevertheless not very clear. The abstract beauty&#xD;
of truth they could neither feel nor see; and, though&#xD;
money~might be as~ safely exposed to them, as were the&#xD;
bracelets hung on forest-trees in the days of righteous&#xD;
King Alfred, edibles were less respected. Even Momma&#xD;
Zip, with her stern fidelity, scrupled not to expound the&#xD;
law of meum~ and tuum with considerable latitude, pro-&#xD;
nouncing, "What put in de pocket, dat teefy; what put&#xD;
in de tuinmack, dat no teefy."&#xD;

thought necessary; for, as 'ho never would sell them,&#xD;
they were not welcome additions to his family.. Miss&#xD;
Lawrence, on the contrary, sat like Charity with open&#xD;
arms, ready to receive all who came, ~notwithstanding&#xD;
that they added much to her cares. These began even&#xD;
in anticipation of their approach, as various small gar~&#xD;
merits, issuing from her work-basket, would testify. On&#xD;
such occasions, every indulgence that nature required&#xD;
was granted: a comfortable room, a competent nurse,&#xD;
quiet, and the usual time allotted for restoration. To&#xD;
this succeeded thoughts for the little ones themselves,&#xD;
who were allowed to be brought to her room, and to&#xD;
lie on a pallet spread on her carpet, that they might&#xD;
enjoy an hour of purer air and brighter sun than could&#xD;
be had in their own proper quarters; and that their&#xD;
mothers, by this notice and inspection of them, might&#xD;
be incited to greater care. When ill~ with her own&#xD;
fair hands she ministered to the little sufferers; and&#xD;
when, as sometimes happened, the freedom of the Celes-&#xD;
tial City was conferred&amp;amp; ~u them, she sympathized with&#xD;
their mothers, but rejoiced for them.&#xD;
The saying, "Many hands make light work," was&#xD;
verified in Mr. Lawrence's establishment, where, as he&#xD;
was used to say, "the negroes raised the corn, the corn&#xD;
fed the hogs, the hogs fed the negroes, and the farm-&#xD;
circle was completed without loss or gain." Horses,&#xD;
carriages, and, stables were the charge of Uncle Mink&#xD;
and his assistants. His wife, Aunt Flore, ranked first&#xD;
among the house-servants, more from her indiVidual&#xD;
superiority than from her department. 'She was a tall,&#xD;
well-formed, bright-looking mulatto, the diplomat of the&#xD;
kitchen, whose ability was best expressed by her mas-&#xD;
ter's saying that "Flore could cheat the devil." Though&#xD;
generally preferring to carry her point by a mana~uvre,&#xD;
she could, when she pleased, use a freedom of speech&#xD;

kitchen, she was supreme. She had been dressing-maid&#xD;
to the young ladies, and afterward attendant on Master&#xD;
Phil's infancy, who' had been so much her pride as to&#xD;
encroach on the rights of her ebony offspring. When&#xD;
no longer necessary to him, she 'had been 'promoted to&#xD;
the ministry of the. interior as assistant to Mrs. Dorothy~&#xD;
a spinster who. had known better days, and who pre.&#xD;
sided in the housekeeper's room. Here 'were prepared&#xD;
all 'the "subtleties" of pastry, cake, and preserves in a&#xD;

There was, indeed, nothing she could not do.&#xD;
Aunt' Minty, the cook, 'a 'fat, simple, good-natured&#xD;

would' sometimes forget the time, or the fire that had&#xD;
been unadvisedly spared to one dish had been unduly&#xD;

budged' not, and noticed the mandate only hy saying, as&#xD;
she quietly lighted her pipe, and took immovable pos-&#xD;

But unlike all was~ M6mma, Zip, an abbreviation of&#xD;
Zilpah, by which name her first master had replaced her&#xD;

eighty, was probably not much overrated. 'Yet she was&#xD;
still useful, and retained a good degree of activity. Long&#xD;
as'she had been in the cou~itry, she had but imperfectly&#xD;
acquired the language; partlyfrom inaptitude, but more&#xD;
from an indisposition to talk. Unlike her race, she was&#xD;
silent, except that she muttered much to herself; and&#xD;
would stroll off into the wood adjoining-" the bush,"&#xD;
as it was called----or into "the hollow," in preference to&#xD;
the chimney. corner. The deep seams. in her cheeks,&#xD;
which lEleanor supposed to be wrinkles, were the marks&#xD;
of her tribe, and, with an occasional fierceness of look&#xD;
and gesture, indicated that she had belonged to one of&#xD;
the more warlike ones; yet she was a kind and patient&#xD;
nurse to the negro children, who, with the care and pick.&#xD;
ing of the poultry, and the feeding of the dog&amp;amp;-.not few&#xD;
in number-were her charge. She was much bent, more&#xD;
from sitting than infirmity, and walked with a stick, not&#xD;
because she required it, but that it added toher dignity,&#xD;
it certainly did t&amp;amp; her power, among the subjects&#xD;
committed to her rule.&#xD;
With different degrees of moral and mental capacity,&#xD;
'they could all ,love Miss ~Gertrude.' She was to them&#xD;
the personification of goodness; and, though they had&#xD;
but a dim appreciation of her whole character, the very&#xD;
vagueness of their perceptions seemed to add 't~ their&#xD;
veneration. She was something which they felt they did&#xD;

The following day, Sunday, the large family carriage,&#xD;
with Mr. and Miss Lawrence, Eleanor, Mr. Philip, and&#xD;
Mrs. Dorothy-always treated with this consideration-&#xD;
and attended by a wagon with all the domestics that could&#xD;
be spared, proceeded to a church of the iDutch reformed&#xD;
communion, where most of the neighboring gentry also&#xD;
assembled. There Domine Van Kleeek, a portly, com-&#xD;
fortable-looking person, officiated. The services, includ-&#xD;
ing the. sermon, were in Dutch, which Mr. Lawrence,&#xD;
understanding, attended to with much reverence, but&#xD;
which Miss Lawrence folloyved with more difficulty;&#xD;
while Mr. Philip understood here and there a sentence,&#xD;
and Eleanor not a word. Much, therefore, as the dom-&#xD;
me might have "edified himself" and the older mem-&#xD;
bers of the congregation, to her and to the other jun-&#xD;
iors, his unknown tongue, "giving forth an uncertain&#xD;
sound," profited little, except that&#xD;
"They got patience and the blessing."&#xD;
But, though the public worship, continued through the'&#xD;
day, ~with the attendance of all rigorously exacted, was&#xD;
not at all to her edification, Eleanor found an hour in&#xD;
Aunt Gertrude's room, under her gentle ministry, fruit-&#xD;
ful of much instrtidion. Among her devotional books&#xD;
were many then in favor, as Flavel, iDoddridge, Watts,&#xD;
and He~vey; the poems of the "divine Herbert" also,&#xD;
from which last Miss Lawrence selected the "Church&#xD;
Porch"-a mine of wisdom, sacred and secular, and his&#xD;
hymn to Providence:&#xD;
"In small things great, not small in any;&#xD;
In all things one, in each thing many;&#xD;
Infinite in one and all!"&#xD;
Listening to her aunt's sweet voice, and moved by her&#xD;
tender devotion, Eleanor was taught that&#xD;

friends; you will, I hope, like them better and better."&#xD;
Then patting her blooming cheek, she added, with a&#xD;
smile and a sigh,&#xD;
"'Time did beckon to the flowers,&#xD;

CEEAVTER XIX.&#xD;
ELEANOR loved to wander about the old house and&#xD;
explore its intricacies. There was a large hail in the&#xD;
second story, but, as her room did not communicate with&#xD;
it, she had been some ~?ays at her grandfather's before&#xD;
she discovered that it contained several portraits. Hay-&#xD;
ing found her way there, she was one morning endeav-&#xD;
oring to sellout the originals through the lapse of time&#xD;
and changes of dress, when Flore crossed the hall, and,&#xD;
as she courtesied, Eleanor detained her.&#xD;
"Stay, Aunt ]3'lore, and tell me about these pictures;&#xD;
and, first, who is this old lady in a black hood that cov&#xD;
em all but her face, and with her hands crossed on her&#xD;
breast?"&#xD;
"Oh, dat ar mass' gran'moder; dat ar cum eber so&#xD;
far 'cross de water."&#xD;
"Indeed I but why is this hole in one of the fingers ?"&#xD;
"Dat," said Flore, smiling, "is Massa Phil's doing's.&#xD;
When he fuss larnt to shoot wid a bow an' arrer, what&#xD;
muss he do but take aim at de ole lady's ring, and shoot&#xD;
ooq Massa was drefful mad; but, Lorry me, missis!&#xD;
none body could eber be mad wid Massa Phil, you know;&#xD;
and so, when he cried, massa guy him a crown to make&#xD;
up."&#xD;
"And then," said Eleanor, laughing, "he shot again,&#xD;
I suppose ?"&#xD;
"No, no; no such a ting, inissis; Massa Phil neber&#xD;
wuss for kindness-always 'member dat, missis," contin-&#xD;
ued Flore, with more emphasis, Eleanor thought, than&#xD;
the matter demanded; wheneverr you want a ting ob&#xD;

"Lorry me, missis! don't you know? dat ar your own&#xD;
gran'ina."&#xD;
"Is it, indeed? Well, I don't wonder grandpapa loved&#xD;
her so much;" and Eleanor looked tenderly and rever-&#xD;
ently on the sWeet face that seemed to respond benig-&#xD;
nantly. "And this, though it looks so young, must be&#xD;
his likeness, is it not ?"&#xD;
"Yes, missis, sure 'nuff; just so, I 'member my mod-&#xD;
er say, he looked when he was married; wid a brack&#xD;
silk bag to his hair, and a brack ribbon crossed ober his&#xD;
bosom, and his waistcoat all kivered with flowers. And&#xD;
dis yer one, missis-I's sartin you must'know dis," point-&#xD;
ing to a very handsome boy, dressed in scarlet, holding&#xD;
a hound in a lea~h.&#xD;
"No, no; I can only guess: Perhaps 'tis Mr. Philip."&#xD;
"Ah! yes, I was tinkin' you'd find 1dm out," replied&#xD;
Aunt Flore, with a significant smile.&#xD;
"And this beautiful girl ?" asked Eleanor, unmindful&#xD;
of the insinuation; "she seems not over fifteen; a bird&#xD;
is resting on her. wrist, and she looks at it with almost a&#xD;
smile: what a lovely face !"&#xD;
"Dar! you juss hit it, missis," exclaimed Aunt Flore,&#xD;
triumphantly; "she was 'dd lubliest young lady in de~&#xD;
whole county-dat ar Miss Gertrude."&#xD;
"I thought as much; and this, I suspect, must be my&#xD;
dear mother; for, though younger and prettier than I&#xD;
can remember her, there is still the same look that I so&#xD;
much love-better 'to me than all the beauty in the&#xD;

though she has a fine color, she is a brunette."&#xD;
"A what, inissis? I, dunno know dat; but I know&#xD;
she was Massa Phil's moder."&#xD;
"Poor woman 1" sighed Eleanor; "she died very&#xD;
young, did she not, Aunt Flore ?"&#xD;
"0 LorI yes, missis; dat ar was horrible time," re~&#xD;
plied Flore, looking darker than usual, and turning away&#xD;
as if' going.&#xD;
"Stay! don't go yet: here is another; but why does&#xD;
this green~ curtain hang over it? No, I can't reach it.&#xD;
You are so tall, Aunt Flore, do you draw it for me."&#xD;
'~ Bress me, missis, II dars'n't; mas~a won't hab it&#xD;

"But why, then, let it hang here ?"&#xD;
At this moment Mrs. Dorothy entered, and Flore&#xD;
moved off, saying to herself; "If she mind to brun her&#xD;
fingers, dat none of my bizzens."&#xD;
Left by Flore, Eleanor applied to Mrs. Dorothy; but,&#xD;
not willing to infringe on the injunction in regard to the&#xD;
curtain, she merely asked, pointing to the picture, who&#xD;
the person was.&#xD;
Mrs. Dorothy looked all round, as if unwilling to be&#xD;
4~verheard, and then said, "I do not know certainly, miss,&#xD;
but IL believe 'tis MasVer Philip's father."&#xD;
"But why, then, covered ?" persisted Eleanor.&#xD;
"Why, you must know, miss, some things happened&#xD;
before I came to live here. Master Philip was then a&#xD;
little child, and his parents were both dead. It is such&#xD;
a sorrowful story that no one cares to talk about it, and&#xD;
so, I suppose, they cover the picture."&#xD;
"What story ?" asked Eleanor, much interested;&#xD;
"there is no objection to its being told, is there ?"&#xD;

shouldn't know all about it, being in the family; but, I&#xD;
suppose, being disagreeable, there was no use talking of&#xD;
it. Master Philip-for ~is name was Philip too----the&#xD;
father of this one, and hjs wife, lived here with the old&#xD;
gentleman, and he wa~much thought of; and his wife&#xD;
too. lie was a great sportsman, like his son, but not so&#xD;
good-natured. He w)~s, by all accounts, more passionate&#xD;
than the old gentleman!" added Mrs. Dorothy, with a&#xD;
look like a note of admiration. "Well, there lived in&#xD;
the neighborhood a young farmer by the name of Kline,&#xD;
Now this man and Mr. Philip were quite friends, because&#xD;
Kline's mother had wet-nursed Mr. Philip; so they were&#xD;
foster-brothers, you know.&#xD;
"But Mr. Philip had a proud, overbearing way, and&#xD;
Kline, too, was high-tempered; and it happened, unfor-&#xD;
tunately, that Mr. Philip's dogs got into Kline's corn and&#xD;
wheat fields. Kline complained, but Mr. Philip made&#xD;
'very light of it. They did it again, and with a good&#xD;
deal of damage; and then Kline, instead of coming ant~&#xD;
stating his loss-for which he would have got compensa-&#xD;
tion, of course-sent a threatening message that he would&#xD;
take the law of him, and kill his dogs if he ever caught&#xD;
them on his land again. Mr. Philip, at this, flew into a&#xD;
passion and sent back a fiery answer; and the next day&#xD;
went in that direction, just as if on purpose to dare the&#xD;
man. The dogs got in again, and this time attacked&#xD;
Kline's hogs, upon which he wishedd out with his gun to&#xD;
defend his property. lie then, being terribly angry,&#xD;
met Mr. Philip coming, as was afterward supposed, to&#xD;
call off' his dogs; but this Kline did not understand, so&#xD;
he made straight at them and leveled his gun, when Mr.&#xD;
Philip caught his arm, and a scuffle ensued. At this&#xD;
moment a couple of men came up, but too late to pro-&#xD;

fainted, was seized with convulsions, and, after giving&#xD;
birth to her son, died within a few hours of her hus-&#xD;
band."&#xD;
'~Dreadful 1". exclaimed Eleanor; "and what became&#xD;
of Kline?"&#xD;
"Oh,' the country was all alive about it! The qual-&#xD;
ity took it up 'because Mr. Philip was one of them, and&#xD;
the rest because , for all he was proud, yet he was so free-&#xD;
hearted ~and manly that every body liked him. But,&#xD;
while they were searching for Kline, he came and sur-&#xD;
rendered himself, 'He said he might as well die as li~~e,&#xD;
for he should never have another happy day again; but&#xD;
he persisted in his innocence, and that the gun had gone&#xD;
off by'aceident. ]3ut it' was said that he had used threats&#xD;

"And what became of him ?"&#xD;

could not hear his name without a shudder, nor bear&#xD;

Mrs. Dale, the little English Quaker woman at the mill&#xD;

was very poorly, in a sort of decline, and he had her&#xD;

St Here I Do you mean to say there is still such a&#xD;
chamber here?"&#xD;
"Certainly, miss; and the best room in the whole&#xD;

of the portal? 'Tis always shut, but you may have ob-&#xD;
served it. Well, that opens into an entry that leads to&#xD;
the dood-icamer. At the end of the entry is ai~iother&#xD;
door, through which the dead are carried to their burial.&#xD;
They say that, in old times, in Holland, the young mar-&#xD;
ried couple used to enter their new house by such a&#xD;
door, which they never passed again till they were taken&#xD;
out feet foremost. My mother was Dutch, and so II have&#xD;
heard all about their strange ways: their 'dood-koeks,'&#xD;
and spiced 'wines sent round at their funerals, and to&#xD;
friends who. could not attend; and the shrouds among&#xD;
the bridal clothes."&#xD;
"Oh !" exclaimed Eleanor, with almost a shriek;&#xD;
"what do you mean, Mrs. Dorothy ?"&#xD;
"Just what I say, miss. Your grandmamma, pretty&#xD;
as she looks there, in her wedding.dress, I have heard&#xD;
say her shroud was waiting for her at that very time,&#xD;
and she was buried in it. And your grandfather, to&#xD;

Mrs. Dorothy "smiled superior."&#xD;

WALT~1~ T~ioI~LEY; OR,&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
THE finest days of autumn came, and Master Philip,&#xD;
who was companionable as well as polite, wa~ always&#xD;
contriving new pleasures for Eleanor. A. year before,&#xD;
and he would have probably made rapid progress in her&#xD;
favor; 'bu1~ she had now a higher standard. Still, the&#xD;
freemasonry of youth, which readily discovers points&#xD;
of sympathy, and the absence of other society near her&#xD;
own age; rendered him: quite acceptable.&#xD;
She loved music, so did he; and with his flute, or as&#xD;
a good. ~ecoud, was always ready to accompany her.&#xD;
She loved the country too, as. he did; and, in a little&#xD;
while, learned to 1~ake an interest in his sports, to caress&#xD;
Eis dogs, and to:rejoice aver' his full bag of game, as a&#xD;
testimony to his skill. She even condescended to take&#xD;
a few lessons. She could not, indeed, be induced to&#xD;
take the life of a bird, but she consented to be instruct-&#xD;
ed in target-shooting; and, with female inconsistency,&#xD;
though so tender toward the feathered creation, had no&#xD;
distresses about fish; for, while she would on no ac~&#xD;
count bait the line, yet, if cousin Phil prepared and put&#xD;
the rod into her hand, she had sufficient nerve to hold.&#xD;
it, and in time became as ambitious of a nibble as the&#xD;
most hard-hearted angler. Then Master Philip was an&#xD;
aeeompli~hed horseman; for&#xD;
"Skill to ride, a science seems&#xD;
Proper to gentle blood ;~*&#xD;
and, although inexperienced herself; yet, under his. tu-&#xD;
ition, when mounted on Fairy-a spirited little pony heF&#xD;
grandfather had given her-she soon learned to keep&#xD;
her seat with a courage and grace that delighted the&#xD;

ft&#xD;
&#xD;
old gentleman; who then, as at whatever else she did&#xD;
that 'was commendable, never failed to exclaim, some-&#xD;
times with a sigh, sometimes with a smile, "Just like&#xD;
mammaae / just like mamma~je/"&#xD;
The* nutting season came; and the brightly-tinted&#xD;
woods, the clear skies, and exhilarating air invited' ev-&#xD;
ery one to the gathering of the autumn's fruitage, "ripe&#xD;
down-pattering." Even Miss Lawrence could not resist&#xD;
it; and with Eleanor, Philip, and a troop of darkies,&#xD;
down to Mink junior, three years old, who occasionally&#xD;
required a lift, set forth to a beautiful grove, within&#xD;
walking distance, of walnuts-called there kriskotomas&#xD;
nuts-ancl. chestnuts.&#xD;
The trees were loaded; and the opening shells and&#xD;
burrs that Jack Frost had cracked for them wanted but&#xD;
a touch to send a rattling shower to the ground. Pomp&#xD;
was ordered up to shake the upper boughs; the children&#xD;
clutched at the lower ones; and Master Philip himself;&#xD;
always ready for any physical exertion, sprang into a&#xD;
fine large tree, near which the ladies were standing, and&#xD;
shook it with such effect that they were compelled to&#xD;
retreat. Soon all hands were busy, and the fruit was&#xD;
worth the labor; not such as people are often content&#xD;
with nowadays, but walnuts worthy of' primeval trees,&#xD;
and chestnuts so large and plump as to give significance&#xD;
to the saying of the little negroes, "De middle one de&#xD;
ox, and de oders de cows"-inforxnavion given to "young&#xD;
missis," but, of course, utterly unintelligible. ~ It was,&#xD;
indeed, a simple pleasure, but Eleanor did not, therefore,&#xD;
like it the less. The merry, musical negro voices alter-&#xD;
nating scraps of song with shouts of rejoicing, as from&#xD;
time to time they found more than they expected; their&#xD;
mutual good ofllces---.the older helping the younger, es-&#xD;
pecially little Mink, who, with an uncommon pair of&#xD;
bandy legs, describing, in his advance, rather circiesthan&#xD;

straight lines, could not well compete with the rest-to-&#xD;
gether with their frequent cautions to "young missis"&#xD;
not to cratchh her fing-ers wid de buz," furnished her&#xD;
much amusement. ~&#xD;
It was an established privilege that, after the family&#xD;
was furnished with nuts for the winter, the negroes were&#xD;
to take the rest, for which they found a ready market,&#xD;
their master's summer visitors often engaging a supply&#xD;
of them. On this occasion Miss Lawrence directed the&#xD;
young' ones to anticipate the gleaning, and fill their&#xD;
aprons and baskets for themselves, kindly contributing&#xD;
all that ~he had gathered to their store, adding, "'Tis a&#xD;
holiday for Miss Eleanor, you know, and must be all&#xD;
play and no Work," at which there was a general cara-&#xD;
coling,' heels higher than heads, and a unanimous "lii!&#xD;
for young missis I"&#xD;
Miss Lawrence soon wearied; but, unwilling to cur-&#xD;
tail the pleasure of the rest, seated herself a little apart,&#xD;
and Was occupied in forming a wreath of the bright&#xD;
a~utuinn leaves strewn around her, which; when Eleanor&#xD;
e~nie in triumph to exhibit her full basket, she placed&#xD;
om1iei~ head.&#xD;

Eleanor kissed her aunt afl~ectionately but she. per-&#xD;
ceived 'that, though' she smiled; it' wa~ 'sadly, and that&#xD;
she~avexted her eyes, as if'they might betray her.~&#xD;
Eleancir 'looked 'inquiringly, and Miss Lawrence at&#xD;
length 8aid, "'Tisnothingdear-only thotights of 6ther&#xD;
days. 'Tis lo~ng:sittce' I went a' nuttin&amp;amp;-I.--.-I wa~ only&#xD;
thinking of those who' gathered with me-and who, like&#xD;
myself; have gathered many a sorrow' too. But come,"&#xD;
added she, -rising, and spe~iking n~o~re ~cho~rfully, "let us&#xD;
return to papa;' he will want to hear of ~ur su ~cess j and&#xD;

wear your wreath, too, dear for he loves to see you look&#xD;
pretty."&#xD;
"And how could she ever look otherwise ?" said Mas-&#xD;
ter Philip, gazing at her admiringly. "But stay, Ele~~&#xD;
anor, let me have the honor of adding one leaf to~ your&#xD;
wreath.-.-this bright sumach."&#xD;
"Oh no !" said Eleanor, shrinking. "They tell me&#xD;
'tis poison."&#xD;
"No, no,. not this kind," and Philip proceeded to en-&#xD;
twine it with the others.&#xD;
"No, indeed, Phil, that would never, do," said Miss&#xD;
Lawrence, tapping him on the shoulder~, "heaven for-&#xD;
bid that you should bestow a fatal crown on her I"&#xD;
Master Philip became embarrassed, colored; his fin-&#xD;
gers seemed to fail of their accustomed adroitness; the&#xD;
leaves would. not lie as he wished, atid his aunt, to re-&#xD;
lieve him, adjusted them.&#xD;
The next morning, at breakfast, Mr. Lawrence was in&#xD;
high good-humor. Miss Lawrence not having yet ap-&#xD;
peared, he called on Eleanor for his coffee, and cracked&#xD;
jokes with her and Master Philip till the entrance of&#xD;
Aunt Flore, with a tray, and a request for a cup of~&#xD;
tea for Miss Gertrude, " and," as she rather pointedly&#xD;
failed, a    else"&#xD;
The old gentleman's countenance changed, and he ex-&#xD;
claimed, "What's the matter now ?"&#xD;
"Nuffin, massa, 'only missis got. drefful headac&#xD;
can't come to br~ffass."                 ~' and&#xD;
"Wh~t'~ brought that on ?"i'he demanded; rather than&#xD;
asked.,&#xD;
"Thinuci know, massa; spose de same thig"&#xD;
"What 'thing!"' exclaimed~Mr. Lawrence, with rising&#xD;

"No,. massa~ does' not know. Speak! what do you.&#xD;

"Massa knows dose nervous turns dese year~. Eb~r&#xD;

"Oh,~yesh1 dare say," hastily interrupting her; "nerv-&#xD;
ous turns, and massa of course to blame. Take your&#xD;
tray, and go! ]3ut hark ye, Flore, tell your mistress&#xD;
that, if' she does not come -down to dinner, I'll quit the&#xD;
house for six months-for a year-forever!" continued&#xD;
he, with voice "crescendo."&#xD;
"'Yes, massa," and Flore slowly retreated.&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence rose, his coffee and muffin untasted,&#xD;
and, crossing his hands behind him; walked up and down&#xD;
the room, with a pace and countenance showing great&#xD;
and angry disturbance.&#xD;
Eleanor was mute with surprise.' Thus far he had&#xD;
been so kind, caressing, cheerful, even gay, and good-&#xD;
humoredto all, that she ha~I begun to think the accounts&#xD;
of his temper greatly exaggerated; but this strange and&#xD;
unreasonable resentment toward dear Aunt Gertrude,&#xD;
merelyfor having a headache, justified all she had heard.&#xD;
She 'looked at Master Philip, but he very composedly con-&#xD;
tinuedto eat his breakfast, not 'at all moved or surprised&#xD;
at what, to her, seemed so unaccountable. At length,&#xD;
mtistering courage, she said, in order to break the dis-&#xD;
tressing silence, "Grandpapa, your coffee is cold;' let me&#xD;
give you another cup. Aunt Gertrude will soon be bet-&#xD;
ter~ I dare say; only a little fatigued with-~-"&#xD;
But he turned on her, and interrupted her almost&#xD;
fiercely, saying "You dare say a great deal, then. Don't&#xD;
talk to machil'd! You know nothing about it. 'I have&#xD;
been: the victim' of:these cursed nerves! Never was a&#xD;
family so full of them! As sure as I feel a little, happy,&#xD;
and enjoy' myself, they must needs break out 1"&#xD;
Eleanor could not but think his message to her aunt&#xD;
not calculated to quiet them.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Fatigued yesterday! What was there to fatigue&#xD;
her? She had been remarkably well of late. No, it&#xD;
was always so; would always be so. his life had been&#xD;
sacrificed to an eternal spirit of contradiction."&#xD;
"Alas !" thought Eleanor, "perhaps too true, poor&#xD;
grandpapa, but whose fault?"&#xD;
Leaving his breakfast. untouched, Mr. Lawrence re-&#xD;
tired to his room.&#xD;
"Never mind, cousin," said Master Philip. "These&#xD;
little flurries soon pass. Our sky has been remarkably&#xD;
clear and quiet since you came; and will be so again.&#xD;
The best way is never to speak to grandpapa at such&#xD;
times; nor even to notice them. Come, shall I give you&#xD;
a lesson in target-shooting? or will you exercise Fairy&#xD;
in a ride?"&#xD;
But Eleanor, hoping to be admitted 'to her aunt's&#xD;
room, declined both. Her gentle tap at the door was,&#xD;
however, answered by Flore saying that Miss Gertrude&#xD;
would see her by-and-by; .and so, putting on her bon-&#xD;
net, she resolved to forget the clouds that had gathered&#xD;
within, by the contemplation of the serene beauty with-&#xD;
out. Strolling along the garden wall she found Momma&#xD;
Zip seated on a stone, with her family of dogs about her,&#xD;
giving them their morning meal, and Eleanor, for want&#xD;
of better amusement, stopped to observe her. With her&#xD;
uplifted cane she enforced obedience and good mailers,&#xD;
not allowing one to encroach on the rest. In the main&#xD;
she succeeded very well; 13~ut Ponto, a pointer of irreg-&#xD;
ular behavior) the particular aversion of the house-maids,&#xD;
because he always contrived to insinuate himself into&#xD;
the nicely-arranged spare beds,' to their infinite trouble&#xD;
and vexation, was, on this occasion, unruly, and, in or-&#xD;
der to secure~ the morsel offered to another, gave him a&#xD;
very 'unfriendly grip.&#xD;
Down came Momma's baton of office, with an angry&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
WALTER TEOR~LEY OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
expostulation, "Fie! shame! bide ye face! What, lick&#xD;
ye feller.sarbent I"&#xD;
But the "fellow-servant" retorted the grip, and, a reg-&#xD;
ular onset ensuing, Zip was compelled to rise, and, mak-&#xD;
ing gQod use of her cane, restored order. She then first&#xD;
perceived "young missis," and, courtesying, was going&#xD;
away as usual, wheh Eleanor addressed her.&#xD;
"Good-morning, Momma; your children have been&#xD;
naughty, T see. Are you often obliged to punish them ?"&#xD;
But with a displeased look, and a shake of her head,&#xD;
she replied, "No piekaninnies~-s~rbent5, like Zip. Pick-&#xD;
aninnies"-.with an appropriate gesture-.-"faroff! gone!&#xD;
golie I"&#xD;
Then, turning away, she sung, to a native air, words&#xD;
she had caught, pi~obably because applying to her-&#xD;
self:&#xD;
"Oh! red was do sun on dat dark, drefful day,&#xD;
When do Buckras dey stole poor Ora away!&#xD;
Do pickaninnies cry, and de blud it did run:&#xD;
Oh! dark was dat day, and red was dat sun 1"&#xD;
and, still retreating toward the house, she continued to&#xD;
sing, and Eleanor to listen, till the air died away.&#xD;
"Poor Momma !" she said, kindly.. "She will not&#xD;
callthe dogs her children; that name belongs to those&#xD;
far away. These are but fellow.'servants, like herself.&#xD;
Poor old soul! Now there is~ a heart that has a history!&#xD;
who ~can tell it? not oven herself. But God has writ-&#xD;
ten it in his Book."&#xD;
The morning passed rather heavily without Aunt&#xD;
Gertrude, ~nd no rniii~unons came from her till near the&#xD;
dinner-hotir,~ when, to Eleandfs surprise, she found her&#xD;
up a~d dressed. To her exclamation Miss Lawrence&#xD;
quietly answered, "Poor papa would be so harassed by&#xD;
my absence that I ought to go down. Don't sa~r any&#xD;
thing about it, dear, nor allude to my headache; it is&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT TEE PAST.          223&#xD;
&#xD;
nearly gone. I shall soon be released and return to my&#xD;
room.&#xD;
4&#xD;
The family met as usual-no questions and no ex-&#xD;
planations. Aunt Gertrude, as always, was gentle and&#xD;
kind, though an occasional contraction of her brow&#xD;
showed her head not yet at ease, and Eleanor saw that&#xD;
the meal was, with her, a mere form; but gx'andpapa&#xD;
was restored to good-humor, and the little disturbance&#xD;
of the morning forgotten.&#xD;
*         "How strange !" thought Eleanor.' "I do really be-&#xD;
lieve grandpapa loves Aunt Gertrude better, than all the&#xD;
*      world, and yet he is more unreasonable to her than to&#xD;
any one else. If she does but look grave, or is not quite&#xD;
well, he is worried to death, though it seems to make&#xD;
him more 'angry than sorry. Any one would suppose&#xD;
that, if she did not always smile, he thought it a re-&#xD;
proach to himself; he makes it such a personal matter."&#xD;
Few as were the words which Eleanor had occa-&#xD;
sionally exchanged with Zip, they had made an impres-&#xD;
sion on her. The dullest can interpret a smile or a&#xD;
*       kind look. Hef youth was, too, an attraction which&#xD;
*       all felt, and seemed to melt even the stern nature of the&#xD;
old woman, who, the next day, to Eleanor's surprise, ap-&#xD;
peared in her room. She had in her hand a roll of&#xD;
"hum-hum," a cotton cloth then in common use.&#xD;
This she unfolded with much formality, and Eleanor&#xD;
wo~idered what was coming. When spread, it appear-&#xD;
ed to be a sheet; and, taking up a corner of it, she&#xD;
made signs.~-which she generally~ preferred to speech;&#xD;
but Eleanor, unable to comprehend, could only say,&#xD;
"Well, Momma, what do you wish ?"&#xD;
She repeated the signs, and then&#xD;
mark dis?" added, "Missis, you&#xD;
"Mark it? Yes; for whom? and why?"&#xD;
"For Zip, missis."&#xD;
&#xD;

224          WALThR rnORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
Eleanor still looking puzzled, she had again recourse&#xD;
to signs. Measuring a space of five or six feet in&#xD;
length on the floor, by two or three in width, she took&#xD;
the cloth, and, wrapping it round her, lay down on the&#xD;
'spot she had defined, and closed her eyes.&#xD;
Eleanor caught a glimpse of her meaning. "A grave&#xD;
~nd a winding-sheet 1" exclaimed she; "can she mean&#xD;
that?"&#xD;
"Yes, yes, missis," said Momma, quickly, and rising;&#xD;
"for Zip-for me."&#xD;
"And I am to put your name in the corner?"&#xD;
"Yes, missis."&#xD;
"Zilpah ?"&#xD;
"No, no, missis," she interrupted hastily and impera-&#xD;
tively-" no Zi[p." Pointing upward with an earnest&#xD;
look, " Piekaninnies up dere not know Zilpah-ole&#xD;
ooman now. No, no-Oral Ora !" Then, falling into&#xD;
the burden of her favorite song, she proceeded in a mel-&#xD;
ancholy strain,&#xD;
"Oh! red was de sun, and dark was do day,&#xD;
When de Buckras dey stole poor Ora away!&#xD;
No, no Zip: 'Ora, missis."&#xD;
Au! yes," said Eleanor, "I understand. Yes, I will&#xD;
do it;" and, with repeated courtesies, the old woman&#xD;
left her.&#xD;
"Poor Momma 1', thought Eleanor, "she has never&#xD;
puzzled herself ~with the questions, 'How are the dead&#xD;
raised? and with what body do they come?' Her mind&#xD;
goes no farther than the restoration of her present one,&#xD;
poor and decrepit as it is. Her only trouble is that, old&#xD;
and altered, her children will not k~ow her except by&#xD;
the name she bore to them. Well, 4ie has an idea that&#xD;
fills her present capacities, and is sa~isfied..-.more than&#xD;
many wiser one~ can say."&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
A NEW circumstance added to Mr. Lawrence's satis-&#xD;
faction in his granddaughter. For some time a weak~&#xD;
ness in one of his eyes had nearly deprived him of the&#xD;
use of both. He had struggled against ~the infirmity&#xD;
with his usual persistence; but he was at length obliged&#xD;
to yield, and have a reader. Master Philip did n?5t quite&#xD;
please him. "He rattled on so fast that it took away&#xD;
his breath to follow him~" He would not tax his daugh-&#xD;
ter's strength, and Eleanor, therefore, was appointed to&#xD;
the office, which she discharged so as entirely to satisfy&#xD;
him. Being thus brought into a closer intercourse, she&#xD;
became so endeared and important to her grandfather,&#xD;
that, wher~ a letter from her mother hinted at her return,&#xD;
he sent an absolute refusal; and, moreover, a demand&#xD;
for their surrender of her for the rest of the year, "in-&#xD;
deed, he did not know that he would ever give herup."&#xD;
Unwilling to revive a resentment so ]ately appeased,&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Meredith consented for the present, and&#xD;
Eleanor, conscious of the happiness she bestowed, ac~&#xD;
quiesced cheerfully in their decision. Perhaps she&#xD;
thought of her pleasant cotillion parties, but it was a*&#xD;
momentary regret; the past had deeper interests, and&#xD;
she almost dreaded to return to scenes that would so&#xD;
forcibly renew them. Checking feelings she must not&#xD;
indulge, she turned again to the details of her mother's&#xD;
letter. ~" And so,"~she reflected," the Middletons are to&#xD;
pass the winter at the south, and Captain Talbot has just&#xD;
sailed for EngJand, to, return nest spring. How he does&#xD;
fly about! Well, he is a pleasant person, and when I&#xD;
am with him I think I like him; but, somehow, I am&#xD;

never the wiser or better for any thing he says. What&#xD;
is the reason? Heigh-ho! Walter would say that it is&#xD;
because he has no faith in goodness. If he praises, 'tis&#xD;
ironically. More frequently he finds it only selfishness&#xD;
well disguised."&#xD;
And snow 'came the dark November days, and out-of~&#xD;
door pleasures yielded to the bustle which at that season&#xD;
reignedin every Dutch establishment. All hands, young&#xD;
and old, found employment; and a suite of cellar rooms&#xD;
were devoted rt~ the various cares of cutting up and&#xD;
packing be:ef and pork, and making an incredible amount&#xD;
of sausages, tolletjes, headcheese, souse, etc.; etc~ Abund-&#xD;
ance reigned throughout; the full and generous house-&#xD;
keepingrecalling the times of the old. Saxons; and large&#xD;
baskets of provisions were distributed among less pros.&#xD;
perous neighbors.&#xD;
Had~ it not been for certain 'sounds of woe that found&#xD;
their :way to Eleanor, she would have better enjoyed the&#xD;
prevailing activity and excitement. Alas I that we can&#xD;
not import humanities as. readily as fashions. Even at&#xD;
this day,~wh~n'aiiiinal~, repo~ing under the shade of lilacs&#xD;
and laburnums, within the abattoirs of Paris, ai~e: gently&#xD;
led off to their doom, neither terrified, beaten, nor con-&#xD;
scious of their impendiiig fate, which* an instant seals,&#xD;
we cofltinue ithe. barbarous customs of our ancestors;&#xD;
and the ~:blood of helpless animals cries from the ground&#xD;
against us, not because we take life necessarilyT but de-&#xD;
stroylt mei'eilessly.&#xD;
This bi.isy~-season oveT, one morning, as Eleanor sat&#xD;
reading to~h~r grandfather, a man drove 'u~ to 'the door,&#xD;
having a young negro girl ~with' him.'. They alighted;&#xD;
and; while the girl was taken into 'the housekeeper's&#xD;
room to "warm .herself, the mail was ushered into the&#xD;
presence of'ML Lawrence.&#xD;
His appesrance was~ not prepossessing; his business&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.          227&#xD;
&#xD;
less so. This was to inquire if Mr. Lawrence would pur-&#xD;
chase the girl whom he had brought with him.&#xD;
Mr~ Lawrence peremptorily refused. "He never&#xD;
meant, with his own consent, to own another black."&#xD;
He was told that she was to be sold only for seven years;&#xD;
but he was equally' immovable. Whereupon the man&#xD;
proceeded to s~iy that' "he did not care to part with her,&#xD;
but that she was an obstinate wench, would be sold, and&#xD;
would be sold to Mr. Lawrence."&#xD;
Eleanor's attention., arrested at first, was now still more&#xD;
so; and, leaving the parlor, she went to Mrs. Dorothy's&#xD;
room to ascertain why the girl should thus persist in&#xD;
the desire to leave her present home and become the&#xD;
property of a stranger. She found a gentle, pretty mu-&#xD;
latto girl, apparently fifteen years old, trembling more&#xD;
from fear than cold. She rose' as Eleanor entered, but&#xD;
did not speak, though she cast a piteous glance into her&#xD;
face. In reply to the often-urged inquiry, "Why she&#xD;
wished to be sold ?" she, after looking timidly and cau-&#xD;
tiously round, at length replied, "'Case, missis, he hard&#xD;
massa. My moder is dead, and my fader is dead, and&#xD;
Aunt Jenny is dead. I got no brokers nor no sisters ,&#xD;
and massa boats me."&#xD;
"Beats you !" 'repeated Eleanor, looking compassion~&#xD;
ately on the little, dqlicately-made creature, "for what ?"&#xD;
"'Case I cry, II aspects , missis; but I can't help it; I&#xD;
got ~no comfort. Oh do buy me, missis U' eontinuea&#xD;
the 'girl, 'with growing hope and earnestness, as~ her&#xD;
heart warmed in the glow of Eleanor's expressive coun-&#xD;
tenance. "Do, do buy me; I'll be your faithful slave,&#xD;
you look so good! and ebery one say all Massa Law-.&#xD;
rence sarvents so happy I"&#xD;
At this moment the parlor door opened, and Eieanp~'~&#xD;
turned away, in order to ascertain the final result of the&#xD;
application; but the frightened girl clutched her dress,&#xD;

carve you till my det; don't gib me back to dat dread..&#xD;

Eleanor endeavored to cpiiet her; and,, having in&#xD;
some ;measure succeeded, she went into the hail, where&#xD;
she heard her grandfather absolutely declining the pur.~&#xD;
chase, and the man gruffly calling for his property.&#xD;
Perceiving that no time was to be lost, she hurried&#xD;
into the parlor, and, throwing her arms round Mr. Law&#xD;
rence, exclaimed, in ,a tone of entreaty, "Do, dear grand-&#xD;
papa, buy this poor thing!"&#xD;
"Why7 you foolish' child, what can I do with her?&#xD;
We have so many now, they are only in each other's&#xD;
way.' 'No, n~, I can't think of it It is absurd 1"&#xD;
:, "But she is unhappy; she has no natural friends, and&#xD;
her matter is cruel to her."&#xD;
"How do you know that?"&#xD;
"She says so',&#xD;
It is not likely. A High Dutcher would sooner&#xD;
risk ~the lif&amp;amp; of his son than his negro; because the&#xD;
one might sell for three hundred dollars, and the other&#xD;
wouldn't sell at all. No, no; it's nonsense; I won't do&#xD;
it. And, as 'to what size says, why, they'll all say that.&#xD;
Floro, and Minty, and Mink, and Tobe, and Jenny, and&#xD;
Pomp, and the devil knows how many more, would say&#xD;
the same 'of'me, if they wanted to be sold."&#xD;
"No, grandpapa, you don't believe that; besides, they&#xD;
don't wish to be 'sold; they are all contented. This&#xD;
poor thing wants to com~ here only because sh~ hears&#xD;
alJ~, your people are so, happy."&#xD;
This last appeal had some effect; but still, the utter&#xD;
uselessness of the girl seemed an insuperable obstacle.~&#xD;
'"is there anything on earth for her to do, Gitty'?"&#xD;
asked Mr. Lawrence, in a despairing tone, of his daughter.&#xD;
&#xD;

Miss Lawrence-an attentive, but silent observer, lest&#xD;
her interference might ro~~se the imp of contradiction,&#xD;
which sh~ hoped Eleanor would exorcise.-..replied, quiet~&#xD;
ly' "She feared not, but she would consult Mrs. Dorothy."&#xD;
"Consult Mrs. Dorothy, indeed !" interrupted, 'her fa..&#xD;
ther. "I'd be glad to know if I can't buy a servant&#xD;
without her permission!"&#xD;
"You do not understand me, papa. I meant.-"&#xD;
Here Eleanor exclaiin~d, as she looked from the win-&#xD;
dow, "Oh, quick, dear grandpapa-speak. The man is&#xD;
bringing up his sleigh. Dear grandpapa, have pity on&#xD;
her. There! there he is! coming into the house; he&#xD;
will carry her off directly! Oh! I hear her sobbing&#xD;
now. Oh, dear? good grandpapa! for my sake 1"&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence, yielding before, at this gave way en-&#xD;
tirely.&#xD;
her your sake, then, Eleanor; but remember I buy&#xD;
for you; she is' none of mine. You must take all&#xD;
the responsibility; I'll have none of it. There-it is&#xD;
said. Call in the man. ' The girl may be right. He&#xD;
has the name of a hard-tempered man," continuedMr.&#xD;
Lawrence, seeking an excuse for what he considered his&#xD;
folly.&#xD;
The business was soon settled, the man off; and Ele&#xD;
anor formally invested with the ownership ~f the girl&#xD;
for the, seven years next ensuing.'&#xD;
The joy of the poor creature can not be told.. FaIb&#xD;
ing on her knees to Eleanor, she thanked her, blessed&#xD;
her, promised everlasting fidelity,' wept and laughed by&#xD;
turns, and' was at length led off to the' kitchen by the&#xD;
sympathizing negroes who had gathered round her, and&#xD;
who all, with a fellow-feeling, rejoiced in her deliver-&#xD;

Eleanor's new responsibilities were not small, but they&#xD;
were cheerfully undertaken. Advised by lier aunt-&#xD;
who feared that jealousy might be awakened, to the 'in-&#xD;
jury of the new-come; if made a pet-she avoided that&#xD;
mistake. After clothing her properly-to which Ele-&#xD;
anor applied herself' with a feeling of importance quite&#xD;
new to her-she was anxious to prove to her grandfa-&#xD;
ther that the girl might 'be turned to some use. But&#xD;
Phyllis had~ only lived in 'the family of a small farmer,&#xD;
where all things were done coarsely,' and many not at&#xD;
all. She had, therefore,' every thing to learn; and. Ele-&#xD;
anor, ~with the good-natured housemaid, had trouble&#xD;
~enough ii~ her training.' The chief difficulty was the&#xD;
girl's eager desire to obey; for, under the rough teach-&#xD;
ings' of ~H~iser's whip, she had ~acqiired such habits of&#xD;
running, jumping, slamming, and executing imperfectly&#xD;
labors beyond her strength, that the nerves and temper&#xD;
of Mr.Lawrence were tried beyond h~s power ofendur-&#xD;
ance, and, unwilling to consign her to a 'worse place, he&#xD;
wished hei~ in"' the Red' Sea"' every day of his life.&#xD;
Poor~' Eiea~nor saw it all, and continually feared an&#xD;
outbreak; y'et such was the girl's ~gratitu.de&#xD;
to herself that she could not regret what she had done.&#xD;
Phyllis folio d her likelier shadoW, stood behind her&#xD;
chair at me ~, watched like a~ dog every movement of&#xD;
~cipation~of her&#xD;
her eye in                 slightest wish, and asked&#xD;
no other pleasuree than to wait upon her.&#xD;
If Eleanor missed' her thimble or scissors from 'its 'ac-&#xD;
custorned place; or if book, basket, or handkerchief Were&#xD;
forgotten, Phyllis seemed ~to divine the want;' aud, fly.&#xD;
in~up stairs, teamingg through entries and rooms, would&#xD;
coilie with th~~'quickness' of thought-.--not seldom head&#xD;
befbr~ heels.Z.~into The parlor 'with the required aJ'rticle.&#xD;
She coii'l&amp;amp;' always j~nd. That was her "specialty;" but&#xD;
to brine without slip or breakage was another matter~&#xD;
&#xD;
G&#xD;
&#xD;
Her unfortunate tendencies in this way brought about&#xD;
the crisis Eleanor had s6 much dreaded.&#xD;
Pomp meeting Phyllis, his hands full, preparing for&#xD;
the tea-table, to relieve himself; in an. evil hour intrusted&#xD;
her with the basket of china. Always pleased to be&#xD;
busy, she started as usual, and, gaining impetus as she&#xD;
went, reached&amp;amp; the parlor just in time to precipitate her-&#xD;
self; basket, and contents at Mr. Lawrence's feet; who,&#xD;
rudely roused from a comfortable nap in his arm-chair&#xD;
by the crash, opened his eyes, with every nerve aja;&#xD;
to see the carpet strewn with fragments;&#xD;
"Not master of himself when china fell," he started&#xD;
up, and, seizing a riding-whip unhappily left out of.&#xD;
place on a table near him, he darted toward the tern-&#xD;
lied girl, bent on punishment. Just at that moment&#xD;
Eleanor, alarmed by the noise, and fearing the truth,&#xD;
entered the room.&#xD;
Rushing behind her young mistress, who, spreading&#xD;
her arms and~skirts, presented a protecting front; Phyl-&#xD;
lis avoided the first onset. But, irritated by opposition,&#xD;
his anger beyond controls her master continued the ~pur-&#xD;
suit, striking at random, with violent threats and denun-&#xD;
ciations more injurious thin his ill-directed whit.&#xD;
Eleanor, shocked and alarmed, besought for mercy&#xD;
and forgiveness; but, finding herself unheeded, she sud-&#xD;
denly exclaimed, with an energy and resolution inspired&#xD;
by compassion, "11 will no~ have her whipped! She is&#xD;
mine I she is mine, 31 say! She 'shall not be touched!"&#xD;
Her manner arrested Mr.~ Lawrence instantly'; and,&#xD;
with one of those alternations to which his impulsive&#xD;
nature was subject, he threW away the whip, .burst into~&#xD;
a laugh, and, throwing himself into his chair, cried out~'&#xD;
"Why, you little jade! do you dare to 'brave your&#xD;
grandfather?"&#xD;
Making a signal of flight to Phyllis, who vanished,&#xD;

2~2.         WALTER 'THORNLBY ;" OR,&#xD;
Eleanor ran to Mr. Lawrence, and, falling on her knees,&#xD;
exclaimed, "Dear grandpapa, forgive me. Ii fear I have&#xD;
said something very wrong; but I could not, indeed I&#xD;
could not 'see Phyllis whipped; and I could not bear&#xD;
that ~you should do such a~thing."&#xD;
Stooping down, he kissed her forehead, and then,~&#xD;
raising, her, said, "You wer~ right, you were right,&#xD;
child. 'I forgot myself; but do, do, Kelly, make that&#xD;
huz~y more. quiet and careful, or she' will drive me&#xD;
mad."&#xD;
Prnnp, present at the scene, forthwith reported it in&#xD;
the kitchen, where it lost nothing at his hands, and&#xD;
gaine4~'great applause from the rest.&#xD;
"I tell you," said he, "yelly neber seed nuifin like it!&#xD;
dat ar young missis is grandashious. I neber tink she'd&#xD;
be' so pr'umshius to speak in dat ar way to ole massa."&#xD;
"Why, dat ar jess de right way, wid massa," ?said&#xD;
Aunt Flore. "I i~now'd' it alloways. Speak up to&#xD;
massa, and ~he comes right to he-self. But won'tt do&#xD;
try dat trick berry often, case he get used to it. Oh dear&#xD;
me I' if Miss Gertrude done ~so long ago, she'd be better&#xD;

"Don't yelly talk about Miss Gertrude," said Aunt&#xD;
Mixzty,2t~king her pipe from her ~mouth; "she neber'&#xD;
can't be xio better dan she is; for'she is an angel of de&#xD;
Thrd now."&#xD;
The " sense of' the kitchen" being clearly with Phyl-&#xD;
lis, she was consoled 'under her mishap. Another link&#xD;
was added to the chain which bound her to her young&#xD;
mistress, who availed herself of her 'influence to make&#xD;
the .desired impression, and, by ~warnings, gentle re~&#xD;
prooTh, and exhortations, poor Phyllis obtained some&#xD;
mastery over her ill-trained feet and ~hands.&#xD;
Eleanor's efforts did, not cease here. With much pa-&#xD;

lis to read. 2~1er progress was slow, but her earnest de-&#xD;
sire to please her mistress seemed to quicken her dor-&#xD;
mant faculties, and she at least gained new ideas from&#xD;
the 'greater degree of intercourse with her young lady&#xD;
to which she was thus admitted. Encouraged by her&#xD;
kindness, she would sometimes venture to speak of her&#xD;
former condition, and, in particular, would dwell on&#xD;
"Aunt Jenny," her only friend when her parents died.&#xD;
"Berry good woman, missis, as eber was! reached&#xD;
me to say my prars, and neber tell no lies. But she&#xD;
know'd nothing, no more dan me, out de book, missis-&#xD;
on'y in de heart. She say nobody eber reached her,&#xD;
on'y de Lord. But, for all she' so good, what you tink,&#xD;
missis? de domine wouldn't let her jine de Church 1"&#xD;
"Not join the Church! and why, Phyllis?"&#xD;
"'Ca~p she didn't know 'nuff; missis, de domine say.&#xD;
She went one, two, tree times to him, and ebery time he&#xD;
turned her back wid de same story, 'No, Jenny; I bery&#xD;
sorry, but I dars'n't let you come to de table till you&#xD;
answer dem questions I put to you."'&#xD;
"Poor Jenny 1" 'said Eleanor.&#xD;
"Yes, missis; but she got help at de last, for when&#xD;
~she went de next time, and he put her off jes de same,&#xD;
she say, says she, 'Well, massa, 'taint no use for me try-&#xD;
in' any more; I shall die 'fore long, for I am ole wom-&#xD;
an; and when de Lord say to me, "Jenny, why you no&#xD;
go to my table dat I spread for you ?" I have netting to&#xD;
say but, "Dear Lord, de domine wouldn't let me."'&#xD;
Now when she said dis, it struck like to his heart, and&#xD;
he said right oft; 'No, Jenny, you sha'n't neber gib in&#xD;

"And she did so?"&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
AND now approached the great festival of the year-&#xD;
the holidays, extending from Christmas eve to New-&#xD;
year's day inclusive-which, in accordance with imme-&#xD;
morial custom, were celebrated with a fullness of all&#xD;
good cheer and merry-making. To this the accumu-&#xD;
lated stores of the preceding month were designed to&#xD;
minister, with the addition of those particularly conse-&#xD;
crated to the time, consisting of every variety of flesh&#xD;
and fish in season, together with every dainty device&#xD;
of ta~rt, cake, jellies, and confitures, headed by the or-&#xD;
thodox mince-pie, and the rear brought up by plum-&#xD;
pudding. Those were the days of soft waffles-a myth&#xD;
since Dutch housewives are extinet-oliekocks, krullers,&#xD;
and the true New-year cake-indeed, every thing "good&#xD;
for food." For then, without dread of dyspepsia or neu-&#xD;
ralgia, in their many horrid forms, or any of the diseases&#xD;
which brood like spectres over our modern tables, p~o-&#xD;
pIe ate, rejoiced, and digested, and invited their friends&#xD;
to do the same, instead of mixing cautions, like poisons,&#xD;
in their food. Then, too, with a liberality not limited to&#xD;
home, chests of cakes, mu~ks, and pastry were sent to&#xD;
kindred in town, and. "portions to those for whom noth.~&#xD;
ing was provided."&#xD;
Then, too, was the season 9f visits and wishes, not of&#xD;
ceremony, but as a paft of the gentle charities of life.&#xD;
Present ties were strengthened, the embers of former&#xD;
friendships stirred, and many a spark of kindness given&#xD;
out by the apparently cold and unpromising mass. Then&#xD;
the first day of' the year was not so n~uch glorified by a&#xD;
crowd of "callers," known only since the last rout, as&#xD;
&#xD;

F&#xD;

<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7727-00000120"/>&#xD;
WALTER ~TPbORNLEY; QR,&#xD;
consecrated by the sight of dear familiar faces, and by&#xD;
the cordial greetings of others, who, jostled aside by the&#xD;
cares of the year, would not let another begin without an&#xD;
assurance that friends were not forgotten. Affections&#xD;
were kept bright, the rust of' carelessness, neglect, or dis-&#xD;
trust rubbed off~ and even ei~mities e~Vinguished.&#xD;
In nQ house were all the observances of the season&#xD;
more scrupulously regarded than in Mr. Lawrence's.&#xD;
The entire week was given up to its appropriate duties&#xD;
and pleasures. Mr. Lawrence, more than usually ani~&#xD;
mated and interestedfor the sake of his granddaughter,&#xD;
would have every day, either at home or abroad, mark-&#xD;
ed by festivity. Dinners of much state and formality,&#xD;
but with a good degree of license in some particulars,&#xD;
were prominent among the entertainments. At these&#xD;
the beauty of Eleanor and the attentions of Mr. Philip&#xD;
p~avided matter of prophetic gossip to the neighboring&#xD;
gentry, while Mr~ Lawi'ence, e~ ~ande ~e~ue~ revived the&#xD;
glories of the olden time, and Miss Lawrence, still lovely,&#xD;
recalled-as a gex~tleman protested, who had long and&#xD;
unsuccessfully worshiped at her shrine-~-the "days of&#xD;
he~ bloom," ~when she "was fairest of the fair." The&#xD;
ladies retireti from the table early, but the gentlemen&#xD;
"sat long at, the wine." And it must be confessed that&#xD;
toasts, songs, and stories sometimes verified ~the proverb&#xD;
which saith, "When wine is in, wit is out."&#xD;
On one such occasion, the gentlemen being ,left to&#xD;
themselves, and politics being ~exhausted, Mr. Philip was&#xD;
exposed to o~ battery of raillery on the subject of his fair&#xD;
%~QU$ifl, much tr~ the delight of his grandfather, kt to his&#xD;
own manifest annoyai~ee. To put a stop t~it~ he readily&#xD;
complied with a call on him for "The Twins of Latona;"&#xD;
and liis fine manly voice was heard in the near drawing-&#xD;
room, where, through the frequently~opening doors, the&#xD;
ladies were made participants of the pleasure. To this&#xD;
&#xD;
A ?1~P AT THE FAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
287&#xD;
&#xD;
succeeded others by different gentlemen, and, at length,&#xD;
"Tom Bowling," sung with~. much taste and~ feeling.&#xD;
Eleanor caught what she could; but, as the song ceased,&#xD;
her sense of sweet sounds"was wounded by the less mu-&#xD;
sical tones, in which a point was contested by her grand-&#xD;
father and one of the company.&#xD;
"I would like to know, sir," said Mr. Lawrence, "by&#xD;
what arithmetical process you make ninety-nine to be a&#xD;
hundred. itt would be a profitable mode of notation&#xD;
applied to some things, but one that I confess I can not&#xD;
understand."&#xD;
The gentleman resisted Mr. Lawrence's interpretation,&#xD;
and they were both at once involved in the quiddities&#xD;
of the "century" question, which had just begun to whet&#xD;
the ingenuity, and sometimes to ruffle the temper of the&#xD;
disputants, even when "grave and reverend seigniors.??&#xD;
But the argument was suddenly, and, perhaps, fortunate-&#xD;
ly interrupted by an uproarious burst of&#xD;
"Here's to the maiden of bashful fifteen,&#xD;
Here's to the widow of fifty;"&#xD;
when the singer was checked by a loud call for "Black-&#xD;
eyed Susan." But, unaffected by it, he persisted in his&#xD;
first choice, and proceeded-&#xD;
"Here's to the charmer, whose dimples we prize,&#xD;
And now to h~r that has none, sir;&#xD;
Here's to the girl with a pair of blue eyes,&#xD;
Ai~id here's to the nymph with but one, sir.&#xD;
Let the toast pass,&#xD;
Drii~k to your lass,&#xD;
I'll warrant she'll prove an excuse for the glass."&#xD;
Spirits rose with voices, as the song went' on with its&#xD;
oft~repeate~1 burden, in which all joined, till, some one&#xD;
wisely moving an adjournment to the ladies, the gentle~&#xD;
men left the "wine-cup" and entered the drawing-room.&#xD;
ilere Mr. Lawrejice-~cut short in his argument, but not&#xD;
silenced-resumed it, by saying to his antagonist,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7727-00000121"/>&#xD;
238?         WALTER TUORNLEY; OR~&#xD;
"If Towed you. £1800? sir? would you hold rue a~.r&#xD;
quitted if II paid you £1799 ?"&#xD;
This, as the gentleman addressed was noted for a care-&#xD;
fuil attention to small sums, was regarded as "a hit!"&#xD;
A laugh ensued. Mr. Lawrence, thereupon, conceiving&#xD;
himself the acknowledged victor, magnanimously per-~&#xD;
mitted the subject to drop; -a conclusion willingly ac-&#xD;
quissoed in by the-rest, who found better entertainment&#xD;
in the smiles that greeted their entrance. But, in~ some&#xD;
instances, an undue exhilaration converted these into&#xD;
frowns, which even muddled heads could understand;&#xD;
or-a gentle look would convey a regret quite as effective.&#xD;
One gentleman, approaching Eleanor~ by whom Mr.&#xD;
Philip was seated, after looking into her f&amp;amp;oe with a&#xD;
scrutiny she neither comprehended ~ior liked, exclaimed,.&#xD;
"Why, Lawrence! what right have you to sing about&#xD;
maidens with blue eyes?. Miss Meredith's are not blue;&#xD;
though ihang me if I can tell what i~ their color."&#xD;
"Pardon .me, Mr. Johnson," replied Philip, rather&#xD;
gravely, "the song, if I am not mistaken7 was your&#xD;
ownP&#xD;
-Without noticing the correction, the gentleman con.&#xD;
tinned,&#xD;
They may be blue to youj however, fo~,"in an audi-&#xD;
ble whisper," such is the color of Love, yQU know."&#xD;
The angry glancee of Eleanor seemed to recall him to&#xD;
propriety, and he~ added, "-But I see- that frowns haye&#xD;
come over them, like clouds~ over the blue heaven, and I&#xD;
must retreat."&#xD;
;-:" Silly man!" thought she, as-he :tu~.~ away, "-~o be&#xD;
putting suebi ideas hito c6usinPhil's head !~' But her&#xD;
wrath ~was~ changed into a laugh by a euphuistic ad~&#xD;
di~ess to -her aunt from a gentleman who did not ap~&#xD;
pear to know -he -was talking nonsense, -and who, after&#xD;
a string of compliments, finished by comparing her&#xD;
&#xD;
A rE~Ea' AT TIlE IA~3T..&#xD;
&#xD;
I1&#xD;
&#xD;
and her niece to the goddess Diana and ai~ attendant&#xD;
nymph.&#xD;
"Oh no, my good sir," replied Miss Lawrence, pre-&#xD;
ferring to laugh at rather than to rebuke him serio-usly;&#xD;
"pray -adapt your hyperbole- to the taste of country la-&#xD;
dies, and let, us be only 'the young moon with the old&#xD;
one in her arms."'&#xD;
- Coffee and whist brQught the gentlemen to~ order,&#xD;
after which a handsome supper completed the plentiful&#xD;
hospitality of the day. -&#xD;
The eve of the new year, by universal consent, was a&#xD;
sort- of domestic saturnalia, admitting among masters&#xD;
and servants of a general game of "Catch who can."&#xD;
This "catching," in which license and stratagem were&#xD;
permitted, the unlearned may require to be informed,&#xD;
consisted in being the first to express the good -wishes&#xD;
of the season, subjecting the person caught, Of course,. to&#xD;
a forfeit. But the gain was but a secondary consider~&#xD;
tion. It was the triumph of -cunning and quickness that&#xD;
chiefly excited.&#xD;
At Mr Lawrence's? each one~ in uci wise wearied wit;h&#xD;
pleasure or service, had a scheme, independent of the&#xD;
others, for the great object of the night. Aunt Flore-&#xD;
had appropriated to her :use a little dark -closet under&#xD;
the hail stairs, whence;. like a spider- darting from its&#xD;
central point of observation, she could rush out on all&#xD;
un4ary comers. She felt quite sure of Master Phil and&#xD;
Miss Eleanor, "'case dey wQuld sartin be coniiug down&#xD;
de great stars to. cotch ol~ ma~sa."- Fat Aunt - -Minty&#xD;
thoughtt she would smudder in dat - ar little -h6le," so&#xD;
she decided to take up a ~o~ition in a larger el6set,. de-&#xD;
signed for- hats, coats, etc., op~ningby a door into the&#xD;
halj.: Pomp had given much consideration to the per..&#xD;
fecting of his devi~e. Watching his opportunity, when&#xD;
the - coast ~was clear in- The evening, he t6ok - down the.&#xD;

key, 'which hung high up' by the side of the door lead-&#xD;
ing into the small private entry, through which' access&#xD;
was obtained to the "dood-kamer," and, putting it into&#xD;
the lock, turned~ it.&#xD;
"Now," thought Pomp, "all's ready; only jess go~ to&#xD;
turn de handle, and [inside. No racket getting' dawn&#xD;
de key; no time lost fumblin' 'bout de lock. Nobody&#xD;
neber 'spect any body in dere! Now, Massa 'Phil, sea&#xD;
ifi don't cotch you 1"&#xD;
Contrivances equally astute occupied all; and then,&#xD;
very innocently bidding "good-night," every one re-&#xD;
tired, apparently to rest.&#xD;
'A little before midnight, one by one, all stole to their&#xD;
coverts. Pomp greatly congratulated himself on his till&#xD;
he got fairly into it when he began to feel rather shaky.&#xD;
Nothing short of the excitement of catching Massa Phil&#xD;
would ever have tempted him to' put his carcass into&#xD;
that fearful place; and even this nearly failed him when&#xD;
he heard a small noise in his rear. He did not dare to&#xD;
look behind him, excusing himself by the reflection,&#xD;
"Can't see nuffin-.-dark as a pocket." The noise was&#xD;
repeated, and Pomp felt much inclined to abandon his&#xD;
project, and cut and run. But "No," thought he, brac-&#xD;
ing himself up, isn'tnt nuflin; rats and mice, It s'pose,&#xD;
dey neber still, always racketin' 'roun. One in Aunt&#xD;
Flore's closet saw away all de worl' like 'a carpenter! I&#xD;

livin~ sawin' wood he I he'! -.-.-hark! hark! 0 Lor'!&#xD;
dat arberry queer noise! dat ar no rats 1"&#xD;
A' low, cautious step behind him confirmed this opin.~&#xD;
ion. He dared not 'look, his knees knocked agaiiist each&#xD;
other, and~ with a "desperate effort he reached~ out his&#xD;
hand for the door, but; bewildered hy fear' and darkness,&#xD;
could' not find it.' He opened his 'lips to cry "Lor', hab&#xD;
&#xD;

mercy!" but his mouth was stopped by a hand laid upon&#xD;
it,, another clutched him by the collar, and Master Phil,&#xD;
half choked with suppressed laughter, found breath&#xD;
enough to say in an under tone, "Happy New Year,&#xD;
Pomp I now keep quiet, make no noise, or I'll 4o Worse&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
"br' bless us! Massa Phil, who ~could tink dat&#xD;
yelly'd be in sich a place as dis ?"&#xD;
"And perhaps I shouldn't 'be here if I had not seen&#xD;
you working away' at the key. 'Twas a good trick, eh,&#xD;
Pomp, to counter-work you. You are a cunning fellow,&#xD;
but you haven't eyes behind."&#xD;
"No, 'deed, Massa Phil; body muss be eyes all ober&#xD;
to cotch you."&#xD;
"Now do you stick by me, Pomp, and you shall catch&#xD;
all the rest."&#xD;
Aunt Flore, meanwhile, in her lair, heard a light step&#xD;
on the great stairs, and, keeping the door on a ora~k.&#xD;
thought, "Dat ar Massa Phil, for sure." ~'The sound&#xD;
approached, and, darting out, 'she exclaimed, "Happy&#xD;
New Year I"&#xD;
No voice responded; and presently, in a tone of great&#xD;
vexation, she was heard to say, "Only dat ar ~ussed&#xD;
dog, Ponto 1" and was returning to her hiding-place&#xD;
when Master Philip and Pomp burst upon her with the&#xD;
triumphant salutation.&#xD;
Aunt Minty, thinking it time for her to, appear, was&#xD;
about to do so, when she found herself entrapped; the&#xD;
door of the closet in which ~he had uiiwarily createdd&#xD;
herself fastened by a spring'bolt Ion the outside, and~was,&#xD;
of course, in~movable from within. Her SituatiQn being&#xD;
discovered, she became a mark for the gibes and jests of&#xD;
all the rest, till at length Pomp, yielding to her entreat-&#xD;
iestoibe " let out," ~opened the door with one of his pro.&#xD;
fonndest scrapes, and, with an introductory flourish' of&#xD;

h~iid, ~aid, "Ladies and gernplen, my moder I Do&#xD;
complaints of do season to you, marm I" Poor Aunt&#xD;
Minty, hiding her face with her apron, panting, perspir-&#xD;
ing, and ashamed, waddled off to conceal her discomfit-&#xD;
ure in the kitchen. In her confusion and haste she&#xD;
nearly overthrew Momma Zip, who, unusually excited,&#xD;
was coming, with Guinea song and dance, to wish hap"&#xD;
py years to all. Poor soul! how few in her long life&#xD;
had been hers! and the future had none for her.&#xD;
The next and greatest achievement of the night was&#xD;
to "cotch ole massa;" and Flore, fearlessly leading the&#xD;
way, softly entered his room. The curtains were drawn&#xD;
as usual, but the light was burning. There was no fear&#xD;
of waking him. No one ever slept on that night till they&#xD;
had seen "the old year out and the new year in." Flore,&#xD;
therefore, in full confidence, stepped along as stealthily&#xD;
as a eat, and, unwilling to' startle him, said, in a gentle&#xD;
yoioe, "Happy New Year to massa I"&#xD;
But no answer was returned; and, peeping within the&#xD;
curtains , to her dismay she saw no one there. Turning&#xD;
to the group behind, which now included nearly the&#xD;
Whole establishment, 'she was about to express her sur-&#xD;
prise and disappointment, when a screen at one corner&#xD;
of the fire-place was thrown down, and Mr. Lawrence,&#xD;
'seated in his arm-chair, brandishing his cane, and laugh-&#xD;
ing, exclaimed, in a merry voice, "Happy New Year&#xD;
to all! great and small! old and young! white, black,&#xD;
and yellow! Now to bed, every one of you, and let the&#xD;
old house be quiet."&#xD;
~" Happy New Year I" cried 'yet another voice, and&#xD;
Eleanor, coming from behind a large cloak that hung in&#xD;
the ro6~n, saluted her grandfather and' aunt, and then&#xD;
ran to shake hands' merrily with all.'&#xD;
Auiit Floze, living the first and last word on. all oc-&#xD;

the "Mistakes of the Night." But a generous distribu-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
THE holidays had passed, but not all the pleasures of&#xD;
the winter. Master Philip was anxious to prove to Ele-&#xD;
anor that she had never known the true delight of sleigh-&#xD;
ing. Rejecting the accustomed roads, where the snow was&#xD;
worn, he resorted to the highway provided by the river,&#xD;
which was just in the finest condition for the purpose.&#xD;
Here, in a commodious sleigh, with plenty of furs, and&#xD;
and a pair of fleet horses, he was always ready to attend&#xD;
her. Some of their neighbors lived, like Mr. Lawrence,&#xD;
near the' river; and, either to visit these, or for more ex~&#xD;
tended drives, sometimes with Miss Lawrence and her&#xD;
father, Eleanor profited by his courtesy.&#xD;
Following the course of the noble stream, beautiful&#xD;
even when ice-bound, with its mountain line on one side&#xD;
and the dwellings of the gentry, the river gods, on the&#xD;
other; its shores dotted by "landings;" dismantled masts&#xD;
peeping out of its sheltering inlets and creeks-.-suggest-&#xD;
ive of the activity that was to succeed the present re-&#xD;
pose; now doubling a headland, now keeping clear of&#xD;
a cove; sometimes under a flood of sunshine, then in&#xD;
the soft moonlight, mirrored in portions of ice not cov-&#xD;
ered by snow, Eleanor was borne along, as if by winged&#xD;
horses, to the&#xD;
"Tintabulation of the bells, bells, bells."&#xD;
What was a drive through the streets of a crowded&#xD;
city to this broad, unbroken highway-jostled by son~ie,&#xD;
running down others, fearing to be impaled by those&#xD;
behind, or to commit an equal violence on those in front,&#xD;
snow half mud, and every jarring sound disturbing the&#xD;
sense?&#xD;
&#xD;
Then, too, Cousin Philip instructed her in sliding. He&#xD;
would have put her on skates, after the fashion of the&#xD;
fair iollanders of whom he had heard, but she was tim-&#xD;
id, and only ventured, clinging to his hand, to slide while&#xD;
he skated.&#xD;
And then, in her pleasant walks and sweet compan-'&#xD;
ionship with Aunt Gertrude, she learned to love Nature&#xD;
under its winter aspects. The clear skies of the day,&#xD;
the gorgeous sunsets, the deep blue of the star-lit firma-&#xD;
ment, the evergreens bending under the new-fallen snow,&#xD;
the symmetrical ramifications of the disrobed trees, now&#xD;
cased in prismatic crystal, then in feathery frost-work,&#xD;
shedding an indescribable softness over the landscape,&#xD;
filled her with a delight which she could not always ex-&#xD;
press. But her heart responded as Aunt Gertrude soft-&#xD;
ly repeated from the old canticle,&#xD;
"Oh, ye ice andsnow;&#xD;
Oh, ye frost and cold, bless ye the Lord;&#xD;
raise him, and magnify him forever!"&#xD;
Then there were fireside pleasures for the long even-&#xD;
ings, among which Mr. ILawrence especially esteemed a&#xD;
game of whist. In this he and Master Philip excelled;&#xD;
and Miss Lawrence had made herself, to please her fa-&#xD;
ther, a remarkably good lady-player. Her grandfather&#xD;
undertook the instruction of Eleanor; and though, with&#xD;
all others, he insisted, like Mrs. Battle, on "'the' rigor of&#xD;
the game,"' to he~ mistakes he was always indulgent.&#xD;
She might omit to return his lead; she might uselessly&#xD;
sacrifice a trump on 'the thirteenth card,' or compel him&#xD;
to cast a king into the jaws' of an' ace, which she ought&#xD;
to have remeitibered was lying in wait for him.; she&#xD;
might, in short, do anything but revoke. 'That he con-&#xD;
sidered an "irredeemable stupidity." 'Once, ~she w~s&#xD;
guilty of it, and received only a' gentle exhortation.&#xD;
The second and last time she thus transgressed he thiew&#xD;

up his e~rds, did not speak-a marvelous self-control-&#xD;
but 'whistled emphatically, anti played the "Cooper's&#xD;
March" with his knuckles on the little stand, always by&#xD;
his side, as if on purpose to afford him this relief. Mad-'&#xD;
ter Philip' saw the tears start into Eleanor's eyes, and&#xD;
adroitly proposed to teach her 'piquet, saying, "You'll&#xD;
soon know enough to beat me, for I am but an indiffer-&#xD;
ent player."&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence smiled.' The cloud passed away, and&#xD;
~leanor, with a grateful look at dousin' Phil, accepted&#xD;
his offer.&#xD;
From that time, for some reason-.--Eleanor feared, her&#xD;
own dullness-her grandfather promoted ~iquet in' pref-&#xD;
erence to whist. Seated by the table at which she and&#xD;
Master Philip played, he seemed to find as much pleas-&#xD;
ure in the game as they did, suggesting from tune to&#xD;
time to his grandson-Eleanor could not tell why, when&#xD;
he certainly ore than she did-" to 'strengthen&#xD;
his point,' n eject 'good cards' in a presumptuous&#xD;
hope of be' 'to remember that 'first in hand' was&#xD;
a great ad -admonitions that seemed to embar-&#xD;
rass Master Ph p rather than to 'help him.&#xD;
Afilie' fall of snow had repaired the sleighing, when,&#xD;
one in&amp;amp;rning, Uncle Mink appeared at' the' parlor door,&#xD;
and' wanted "to speak -to massa."&#xD;
"Well, what isy it, Mink ?"&#xD;
After shifting' from leg to leg, and twirling his hat&#xD;
round on his l&amp;amp;and, he answered, "A drefful bad rheu~.&#xD;
mati~" in both h~is arms and in his right shoulder.'&#xD;
"AU' that's bad ~ but Miss Gitty can cure&#xD;
Mink looked doubtful; ~aid' he'd "tried taissus's stuff,&#xD;
and it didn't do no good6"&#xD;
"W~ll,'we'll' hava Dr. Nelson. then."&#xD;
Again Mink' hesitated. At length h~ continued,&#xD;
"?kase, massa, dere's a doctor at do Hook cures brack&#xD;
&#xD;
yolks all roun' here-Mr. Johnson's Jake, and Mr. Div.&#xD;
bois's Torn, and all-I'd like try him."&#xD;
"Some cursed quack I" said Mr. Lawrence, with rising&#xD;
anger.&#xD;
"Yes, massa, dat's de name-Doctor Quaco-colored&#xD;
man, massa."&#xD;
"Yes, so I supposed. But how can you go? Not&#xD;
on horseback with lame arms; at least,. you couldn't if&#xD;
it were my business, I'll engage; and it won't help your&#xD;
rheumatism to walk there."&#xD;
"No, massa; but if massa let us take de farm horses&#xD;
-.--dey rader gay for want of work juss now-and massa&#xD;
knows dem High Dutch horses-muss keep 'em. down,&#xD;
or, dam 'em, dey will hull."&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence's cane descended with an emphasis that&#xD;
made Mink starL&#xD;
"No swearing, Mink! Nobody swears here but me I"&#xD;
A low, bow, and "Beg pardon, massa-clidn't tink,"&#xD;
acknowledged Mr. Lawrence's superior claim.&#xD;
"Well, and who to drive? You can not, of course,&#xD;
drive wild horses.".&#xD;
"Pdmp, massa, can drive me and Flore."&#xD;
"Flore, too, what's the matter with her ?"&#xD;
"Nottin', massa, only she tinks de doctor help little&#xD;
Mink's legs: de doctor drefful smart on de rickets,&#xD;
massa."&#xD;
"So little Mink must be poisoned too! and why not&#xD;
try Dr. Nelson for him, if not for yourself?"&#xD;
Mink scratched his poll; but, more afraid of his wife&#xD;
*&#xD;
than of his master, he proceeded:&#xD;
"113'lore tinks dat he don't care for de colored folks-&#xD;
on'y for de quality, massa."&#xD;
"Oh, the devil fly away with Flore! She's always&#xD;
thinking; and why can't you think yourself; man&#xD;

cially, never to be exercised in opposition to his wife.&#xD;
"Well, well, go your way, but take care the horses&#xD;
don't break all your necks-Doetor Quaco can't mend&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"No, massa, I aspectss not ;" and Mink vanished.&#xD;
Florets: diplomacy prospered.. It was true, Uncle&#xD;
Mink had th~rheumatisiii, and perhaps little Mink the&#xD;
rickets; but she had a small fund, a good deal increased&#xD;
by her New-yearings; and this was to be invested at a&#xD;
shop~ in the neighboring village, and Doctor Quaco was&#xD;
to 'be taken on the way. Having had many indulgences&#xD;
of late, 'she thought it advisable to put this expedition&#xD;
on th.e footing of necessity, thus leaving the field open&#xD;
for farther favors, if desired.&#xD;
Pomp's appearance at the tea-hour announced their&#xD;
return.&#xD;
"Well, Pomp," inquired Mr. Lawrence, "what did&#xD;
Quaco say?"'&#xD;
"lie say, inassa," replied Pomp in an oracular man-&#xD;
ner, "dat Uncle Mink hab de rheumatic, and little Mink&#xD;
de rickets."&#xD;
"Yes, that we knew before; but what's to be done?"&#xD;
- ,"Re gib' some stuff in a bottle for bote, massa; and&#xD;
he say Uncle Mink muss hab some spirits too,~ added&#xD;
Pomp, anxious to account for a suspicious-looking jug&#xD;
that had appeared.&#xD;
"Spirits! 'what, inside or~out ?"&#xD;
"B6te, massa; to foment outside, and take inside for&#xD;
etanial complaints."&#xD;
"I dare say! The scoundrel! Gertrude, you must&#xD;
look info this. Mink has been a sober fellow all his&#xD;
life. I won't have' this quack make a' drunkard of&#xD;
him."&#xD;
'But a glimpse into the kitchen at eleven o'clock that&#xD;
&#xD;
A ?EJ~P AT TIIS PAST.         249&#xD;
night would have relieved 'Mr. Lawrence~s alarm on the&#xD;
subject of Mink's temperance.&#xD;
By the light of a roaring fire was to be seen a ta~Ae&#xD;
of large dimensions, covered with the good things hoard..&#xD;
ed from their holiday luxuries7 and smoking with addi-&#xD;
tions of their own prospering. Of these, most conspicu~&#xD;
ou~ was an immense turkey, in regard to which Flore&#xD;
h~d mystified Momma Zip, the guardian of the poultry-&#xD;
yard; averring that Miss Jlyslip at the ferry had given&#xD;
her a turkey's egg, and that she had put it~ in a certain&#xD;
nest where, the process of incubation had just begun.&#xD;
Consequently, this individual turkey was the product,&#xD;
and the property hers, the intermediate feeding ,~and care&#xD;
to the contrary notwithstanding. Momma, who, how-&#xD;
ever lax her notions on the subject of food, as has been&#xD;
said, was incorruptible in regard to any thing committed&#xD;
to her in trust, demurred, but in vain. She eould never&#xD;
talk fast enough for Aunt Flore~&#xD;
At each end of the table was a bottle of the spirits&#xD;
prescribed for Uncle Mink, and among the guests Doc-&#xD;
tor Quaco himself and his wife, both of whom recoin-&#xD;
mended his medicine by their fearless use of it.&#xD;
Here they were, in a state of high enjoyment! This&#xD;
upper: kitchen being detached from 'the house, and with&#xD;
but one window, which looked in another direction, they&#xD;
had no fear of being seen or overheard, when a rap at&#xD;
this only window produced. a general start. Knives and&#xD;
forks dropped, the glass on its way to the lips was ar-&#xD;
rested, the joke was cracked the wrong way, and laugh-&#xD;
terdiedinthebirth!&#xD;
Aunt' Flore was the first to recover. ~i~ig to the&#xD;
window, a face she never found unfriendly, 'appeared,&#xD;
and, shoving it softly up, she said in a low voice, "Mas-&#xD;

"No, N[assa Phil; dat's de word: mum for you, mum&#xD;
for&#xD;
lJpon this the door was unbolted, and Philip, shiver-&#xD;
ing with cold, yet casting a merry glance at the table&#xD;
and those around' it, drew up to the fire.'' Insisting that&#xD;
no one should' be disturbed, he was' formally introduced&#xD;
by' Pomp to "de' doctor and he lady ;" after which, be-&#xD;
ing ,well warmed, and taking, by Flore's advice, a taste&#xD;
of the doctor's medicine, he gladly took the supper that&#xD;
she spread for him on a table in the wide chimney-cor-&#xD;
ner, saying, with her usual tact, "Massa Phil too cold to&#xD;
come to de table-muss keep close to de fire."&#xD;
" This is 'a capital' turkey, Aunt Flore; where did it&#xD;
conie from?" asked he, significantly.&#xD;
"Not bery far off," she replied slyly; then added,&#xD;
"Fromn~Miss Hyslip's,' at do ferry, Massa Phil."&#xD;
"And there's more' where this came from, I sup-&#xD;
pose?"&#xD;
"Oh yes, whenever Massa Phil wants a supper" said&#xD;
she, with a smile which he well understood.&#xD;
lie did not long interfere with their pleastires; but,&#xD;
C4'IitiQfliflg them to be quiet, and with ~an "aside" to&#xD;
Aunt Fl~ore to get her visitors away without rousing the&#xD;
dogsI he' retired, having the satisfaction of hearing him-&#xD;
self; through the closing doors, applauded as "dat ai9s&#xD;
do ~tniest gem'Ien as walks de ground."&#xD;
That evening, 'to Mr. Lawrence's .surprise and 'annoy-&#xD;
ance, Philip had. not been at home. Miss Lawrence en-&#xD;
deavored ~to ~often it to him by saying he had 'been un-&#xD;
usu~lly domestic of late,' and that whenever he was ab-&#xD;
sent~ it was always easily explained.&#xD;
" e; oh yes," replied the old gentleman, trying, but&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PASTI.           2~1&#xD;
not very successfully, to treat it as a light matter.&#xD;
"Come, Eleanor, let me give you a lesson in piquet; or&#xD;
shall we try three-handed whist, since that runaway has&#xD;
reduced us to it?"&#xD;
This was preferred as including all, and grandpapa&#xD;
played "dummy" to the ladies.&#xD;
The next morning Philip appeared at breakfast at the&#xD;
usual hour, but Eleanor thought he had not his accus-&#xD;
tomed cheerful face.&#xD;
"G'ood-rnorning, Phil," said Mr. Lawrence; "you de-&#xD;
serted us last evening; where were you?"&#xD;
"I was out, sir."&#xD;
The gravity and decided tone of this reply, so rare&#xD;
with him, seemea to disconcert his grandfather.&#xD;
"Out! why.-why yes, I know that. I said so. Out,!&#xD;
to be sure you were.&#xD;
But he did not repeat the inquiry, and Philip proffer-&#xD;
ed no explanation; turning the conversation 'by some&#xD;
rather forced small-talk with EleanQr and his aunt, he&#xD;
left the room as soon as the meal was over.&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence sat silent, evidently brooding over some-&#xD;
thing that much displeased him; and, not inclined, as&#xD;
usual, for society or reading, summoned Pomp, and with-&#xD;
drew to his room. On entering he found Aunt Flore&#xD;
there. He had never condescended to any espionage&#xD;
with servants or children; but, thinking Flore very like-&#xD;
ly to know mere in the present instance than himself;&#xD;
and choosing the most direct mode, he dismissed Pomp,&#xD;
and said,&#xD;
"Where was Master Phil last night, Flore?"&#xD;
Now Flore knew nothing; for her young master,&#xD;
with all his reliance on her good-will, had never admit-&#xD;
ted her to his confidence. Nevertheless, she always in-&#xD;
stinctively spoke as if retained by him.&#xD;
"Massa Phil! why, in his bed, massa; so fass asleep&#xD;

"Laws, massa t dey can't hole a candle to our young&#xD;

"Do you think so, Flore ?" replied Mr. Lawrence~&#xD;
much mollified. "Well, you may go now, and send&#xD;

Pomp reappeared ~ and, while assisting his master to&#xD;
put on his dressing-gown, said, "Massa loss any ting ?"&#xD;
"1~o, Pomp, nothing 'but my temper, which I shall&#xD;
find by-and-by."&#xD;
Pomp, something of an "expert" in the interpretation&#xD;
of looks, perceiving that his master was in a more com-&#xD;
placent mood than when he left the breakfast-room, ven~&#xD;
tured, as he had sometimes done with impunity, a little&#xD;

"Yes, massa," replied Pomp, handing at the same&#xD;
time a crown piece that had slipped within the lining of&#xD;

Mr. Lawrence took it and put it in his purse, giving&#xD;
Pomp, at the same time, a. half-dollar for his honesty.&#xD;
He received it with a grin, displaying an enviable set&#xD;
of ivory, and a low bow~ saying, "Wish massa loss his&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAI'TER XXIV.&#xD;
THE least agreeable season had come. The snow wa~&#xD;
gone, and the removal of its white drapery disclosed 'the&#xD;
ragged garments of winter. The roads were nearly&#xD;
impassable, and the ide, cracked, unsound, and in many&#xD;
places covered with water, was no longer to be trusted.&#xD;
Moving was out of the question, and the young people&#xD;
were reduced to in-door occupations. In books they&#xD;
had little companionship; but Philip, an observer of'&#xD;
nature. and. a lover of animals, had.pets of all kinds, un-&#xD;
derstood their habits, and could give Eleanor practical&#xD;
hints in natural history, as well worth having as if found&#xD;
between the boards of a book. Birds, including choice&#xD;
species of poultry, rabbits, cats, and dogs, abounded&#xD;
about the house and premises, and were taught to dwell&#xD;
in most instructive harmony. In proof of which, Phil&#xD;
delighted to point out to Eleanor a spaniel on, the hearth-&#xD;
rug, with his fore-paws lovingly folded round an unre-&#xD;
sisting cat. At another time h~e directed her attention&#xD;
to this same dog performing the part of dry-nurse to a&#xD;
family of kittens, whom the mother, dissatisfied with her&#xD;
quarters, was removing. Following her lead, he took&#xD;
up one in his mouth and gently placed it in the new&#xD;
bed the mother had found, to which he was seen return..&#xD;

Having ascertained it, he licked them and retired. On&#xD;
another occasion Eleanor was called on to assist in the&#xD;
care ofa pet bantam hen, whose 'feet were nipped by the&#xD;
frost. Too tender to be at once exposed, Philip inter-&#xD;
ceded with Mrs. Dorothy-no one in the house could re-&#xD;
fuse him-to admit her and her basket, for a few days,&#xD;

into the housekeeper's room. The species were then&#xD;
rare; very small, strongly marked, anfi cared for as a sort&#xD;
of curiosity. The basket was capaoikus. Philip, having&#xD;
furnished it with a perch, brought in her mate to con-&#xD;
sole her, and Eleanor was requested to' admire the con-&#xD;
jugal devotion of the little cock, as he spread a shelter-&#xD;
ing wing over his disabled spouse.&#xD;
Then Cousin Phil asked assistance in preparing his&#xD;
flshing~.tackle, and she soon learned to manage the quills&#xD;
and corks, to twist the horse-hair. lines; and to attach the&#xD;
hooks.&#xD;
What are you so busy about, Eleanor ?". inquired&#xD;
her aunt.&#xD;
"Making 'snares' for Cousin Phil," she replied, very&#xD;
innocently.&#xD;
Miss Gertrude looked at her fathe-r,~ and smiled. He&#xD;
put his finger on his lip to check farther comment, but&#xD;
he rapped on the' table a 'merry accompaniment, as. lie&#xD;
hunjjmedthe air of" Come, haste to the wedding 1" Ele-&#xD;
anor, intent on her work, neither saw nor heard.&#xD;
Philip; meanwhile, in anticipation of the ducking sea-&#xD;
son, was getting things in readiness.: His canoe required&#xD;
repairing and a frdsh coat of white paint; and a ~suit of&#xD;
white linen was to be p~it in order,.that, thus disguised,&#xD;
he might, unsuspected, invade the haunts of the, water-&#xD;
fowl in the. coves and creeks as soon as the ice should&#xD;
move. 'This, of itself, was an eVent. For some time, in&#xD;

stratagems devised against the "poor ducks," as Ele~&#xD;
anor said; but, in spite of her compassion, she laughed&#xD;
heartily at Philip in his death-dealing dress, which want-&#xD;
ed, as she told him, "only the 'mist-cap' of the dwarfs to&#xD;
be complete I"&#xD;
Thrown thus continually and naturally together, it&#xD;
would have been strange if a more than common mutual&#xD;
interest had not been excited. In Eleanor this was un-&#xD;
disturbed by any. question of its nature. Preoccupied&#xD;
as she was, Philip but supplied to her, as nearly as pos-&#xD;
sible, a want 8he often lamented. He was a brother,&#xD;
with just that touch of galiantr3~ and devotion, in which,&#xD;
however true 'iii' more important respects, brothers are&#xD;
sometimes deficient. The only deduction from her con-&#xD;
tentment was; that he himself was less cheerful than for.&#xD;
merly.~-.often abstrtuited, and evidently perplexed, rest~&#xD;
less, and, she feared, even at times unhappy.&#xD;
One evening it so~ happened that they were left alone&#xD;
in the parlor, Mr. Lawrence having retired earlier than&#xD;
usual; and Miss Gertrude, leaving them to finish a game&#xD;
of piquet, soon followed him.&#xD;
They continued to playfor some time, only speaking&#xD;
as the game required. At leiigth 'it approached its term-&#xD;
ination, and, having compared "points,". etc., Eleanor,&#xD;
first in hand, proceeded to play, counting, as she went,&#xD;
till, reaching1' one hundred," ~he exdaimed, "There! I&#xD;
have beaten you again! Why, Cousin Phil, you are a&#xD;
better player than Jam, yet, lately, I always win! What&#xD;
are you thinking of?"&#xD;
"Sha4 IL tell you, I~k~mw?" stdd ho, with an expres-&#xD;
sion so strange, hurried,.excited, and yet hesitating, that&#xD;
she could only gather ~om it some trouble, of which,&#xD;
indeedsince the evening when his absence had incurred&#xD;
his grandfather's displeasure, she had been apprehensive.&#xD;
"Shall I tell you ?" he repeated.&#xD;

"Do, cousin," she answered, looking compassionately;.&#xD;
"do, I beg of you. If I can only give you comfort or&#xD;
counsel, I shall be so happy !"&#xD;
"Hear me, then, while I have courage to speak," and&#xD;
with a sort, of desperation he proceeded:&#xD;
"Cau you, to~71 you, dear Eleanor! unworthy as I am;&#xD;
little as I can offer in return for all your beauty, accom-&#xD;
plishments, and goodness; little as I have done to ob-&#xD;
tain such a possession! will you, dear Eleanor-will you&#xD;
be my w~/~?"&#xD;
If lightning had fallen at her feet, Eleanor could hard-&#xD;
ly have been more stunned. Althotigh, on rare occa-&#xD;
sions, some expression of her grandfather's had for a mo-&#xD;
ment suggested to her an uneasy thought of this kind,&#xD;
still he had so rigidly forbidden, and, in the main, had so&#xD;
carefully avoided all allusions or raillery in the presence&#xD;
of Eleanor, and Philip himself had been so much more&#xD;
like a friend than a lover, that she had entirely dismiss&#xD;
ed the idea from her mind. And now to this good,&#xD;
kind, pleasant cousin she was to give pain, which' howe&#xD;
ever short-lived she might hope it would prov~, must at&#xD;
present be the keenest she could inflict-on one, too, on&#xD;
whom she would only confer happiness! Her heart and&#xD;
eyes were full; she could scarcely command words to&#xD;
convey the sentence' for which he waited in silence as&#xD;
profound as her own. At length she spoke.&#xD;
"Dear cousin, I am' sure you will believe me when I&#xD;
say that this declaration overwhelms me with surprise&#xD;
and-and---.grief! ' Forget it, IL entreat you, as IL shall&#xD;
do. Let me not lose my cousin and my friend because&#xD;
IL can-never be any thing else to him !"&#xD;
Not daring to raise he~ eyes to Philip, who sat voice-~&#xD;
less by her side, they remained immovable, till, unable&#xD;
longer to endure the constraint, she ventured a look to-&#xD;
ward him, and still another, for astonishment now got&#xD;

"A. desperate one, dear Eleanor, if you were not the&#xD;

"Married you, of course, even at the sacrifice of my.&#xD;

"Sacrifice I" exclaimed Eleanor, laughing heartily.&#xD;
"Well, there have been love-scenes, sentimental, trag-&#xD;
ical, passionate, heroic, sublime; but so ridiculous as&#xD;
this, never!"&#xD;
"Ah! Eleanor, to you it is all sport, but to me confu-&#xD;
sion and fear still."&#xD;
"What, though I have refused you! What else can&#xD;
I do to make you happy? I thought but now that you&#xD;
were on the pinnacle of felicity, having escaped from&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Yes, for a moment; but have patience with me, Ele-&#xD;
anor; I can not rest without explaining my strange con-&#xD;
duct. I do not ask your love, but I can not be denied&#xD;
your friendship-I dare not say your respCct. It is not&#xD;
very late-" and, throwing more wood on the fire, plac-&#xD;
ing a chair near it for her, and drawing another toward&#xD;
it, he seated himself by her side. "Now for my confes-&#xD;
sion:&#xD;
"You have not known, Eleanor,. nor I, much longer&#xD;
than since you came here, that a darling object of our&#xD;
grandfather was to unite us. It was natural enough&#xD;
that he should desire it. It would draw closer the few&#xD;
family links left, would keep his fine fortune unbroken,'&#xD;
and secure to himself in his old age' the society~and care&#xD;
of those dearest to him. This desire was strengthened,&#xD;
of course, by your presence. Oh , you have no idea of&#xD;
the fondness and pride with which he regards you, and&#xD;
the efforts. he has made to inspire me with his own' ad.&#xD;
migration I"&#xD;
"Nor of your indifference!" interrupted Eleanor,&#xD;
archly.&#xD;

&#xD;
"oh no, not indifference, dear cousin; I had no heart&#xD;
to give."&#xD;
Eleanor tittered an exclamation, and could not sup-&#xD;
press~a sigh.&#xD;
"Au!" thought 'she, "poor Phil; now I do, indeed,&#xD;
feel 'for you"'&#xD;
"Nothing," he continued, "could have preserved me&#xD;
from an' attachment which I now see would have been&#xD;
hopeless but a pre-engageni~nt of my honor and 'affec-&#xD;
tion. And now, how shall I venture to say to whom?&#xD;
how ask your sympathy. for one so 'far below you ?"&#xD;
Eleanor started. She began to fear the confidence to&#xD;
which she had so readily assented.&#xD;
"' Neither fortune nor family-"&#xD;
"Oh," said Eleanor, much relieved, "if that be all!&#xD;
But tell me, tell me who she is."&#xD;
"Let me go back 'to the beginning. She is the child&#xD;
of humble parents, was born in my grandfather's house,&#xD;
and remained there the first three years of her life."&#xD;
"What I' Priscilla Dale ?"&#xD;
 "The same. Are yon mortified for me, Eleanor ?"&#xD;
"Not mortified, but-but sur~flsed," said she, too&#xD;
honest to conceal her feelings, and Philip proceeded:&#xD;
"Both motherless children, we seemed instinctively&#xD;
drawn toward' each' other-.--just difference enough in our&#xD;
ages to make her my plaything, and me her protector.&#xD;
A. sister~of her father came from England to live with&#xD;
him, and the' child left us. But "my aunt's interest in&#xD;
her continued; and, from time to time, she came to her&#xD;
for better instruction than she could get elsewhere. If&#xD;
she was industrious, her 'reward was to remain 1:or an&#xD;
hour's play wifli me; and w'h~n I was in especial favor;&#xD;

"And my grandfather and aunt.-.-had they no fears,&#xD;
no suspicions ?"&#xD;
"My grandfather, at that time an active man of busi~&#xD;
ness and a warm politician, was too much occupied to&#xD;
observe attentively what a mere boy was dQing. Be.&#xD;
sides which, as J grew older, I became more cautious,&#xD;
and confined my intercourse with her to such times and&#xD;
places as would excite no remark. As to my aunt, she&#xD;
was an invalid, and had few opportunities of observation.&#xD;
Thus it went on till my final return home; and then,&#xD;
though with continually-increasing affection, I formed&#xD;
no purpose, had no plan for the future. I thought only&#xD;
of seeing her; of the pleasure of being with her. I had&#xD;
never even mentioned love to her, though I could not&#xD;
butt feel that there, was but one heart between us. At&#xD;
length I was roused~ from this dreamy happiness by the&#xD;
rumor of a lover urged on her by her father and I re-&#xD;
solved to secure her, My grandfather's consent to our&#xD;
marriage was impossible. The very suggestion would&#xD;
be an offense scarcely pardonable. A clandestine one,&#xD;
sure to be discovered, would be only .an aggravated&#xD;
crime. In this stuation-a madman and a fooll" con-&#xD;

tempting to speak ~he endeavored to use and leave the&#xD;
room, but he caught her hand and almost forced her to&#xD;
be seated..&#xD;
"Stay, Eleanor! you have not heard all. Heaven&#xD;
and Priscilla saved me from the wicked folly I was&#xD;
ready to commit."&#xD;
Eleanor breathed more freely; raised her eyes with a&#xD;
look expressive of thankfulness, but could not speak.&#xD;
"Yes; she, hitherto the gentlest and most loving&#xD;
creature, spurned not only my proposal, but myself!&#xD;
Yes, spurned me! Oh, you can not know, even if you&#xD;
had seen her, the spirit that kindles those dark eyes&#xD;
when roused! I was banished. No entreaties, no 'pray-&#xD;
em could obtain my pardon, nor even a glimpse of her.&#xD;
At length, after repeated attempts to see her, I was in-&#xD;
formed that she had gone with her aunt to Pennsylvania,&#xD;
where a brother of her father resided. Gone ostensibly&#xD;
to attend a yearly meeting of their sect, but, as I well&#xD;
knew, to avoid me. Her aunt returned without her.&#xD;
Their friends had pressed Priscilla to remain, and she&#xD;
did so, till not long since."&#xD;
"And then? were you allowed, to see her?"&#xD;
"To .see her! yes, bnt to no purpose. You recollect,&#xD;
perhaps, the evening when my absence Crorn home caused&#xD;
some uneasiness ?"'&#xD;
"Yes, perfectly; what then?"&#xD;
A' That evening she consented to see me. Up to that&#xD;
time, notwithstanding my grandfather's desires-almost&#xD;
his commands-and my own growing affection for you,&#xD;
my dear cousin, II never wavered in my fidelity to Pris~&#xD;
cilla. The object of this interview was to implore her&#xD;
to cons~enIt to an immediate private union, trusting, by&#xD;

"Decided and inexorable; and we parted. Despair,&#xD;
together with resentment, now stimulated me, and I re~&#xD;

know what a wretched business I made of it, and will&#xD;
now understand why I could not even desire success. I&#xD;
gain, indeed, nothing by my failure but time-time, yet&#xD;
to make' peace with Priscilla; perhaps to obtain her con-&#xD;
sent; and, on the part of my grandfather, his relinquisli&#xD;
ment of a purpose he ~will now see to ~be impracticable."&#xD;
Eleanor had listened with the deepest interest. 'Ex~&#xD;
tending her hand to Philip, restored to her confidence&#xD;
by the sacrifice at which he was willing to atone for his&#xD;
fault, she said, "I am so glad, my cousin, that II can love&#xD;
you still. Yet I have a thought that will burn out my&#xD;
heart if I do not speak it. It is not for me to decide be-&#xD;
tween your duty to grandpapa and what is due to Pris-&#xD;
cilla. I can but admire your courage and generosity.&#xD;
But I have somewhat against y~u, for all that. What&#xD;
right had you to consider that my whole heart, without&#xD;
which I would marry no man, was fairly obtained by the&#xD;
mere offer of an unwilling hand? Had you gained my&#xD;
affections, what had you to give me in exchange? Noth~~&#xD;
ing! which II was, of course, to find out to my sorrow.&#xD;
No, no, Cousin Phil, it is bad, it is wicked, thus to trifle&#xD;
with love. Burn no false fire on that altar."'&#xD;
He felt the rebuke. "Dear Eleanor, it was base, it was&#xD;
itnmanly; I see it now as never before; but be merciful,&#xD;
and forgive me."'&#xD;
"IL have already done so. There is nothing so ener-&#xD;
vating, 'so treacl~erous; so cruel, as fear. Alas! that&#xD;
grandpapa, with all his affection for you, should have&#xD;
held you in subjection to this bondage. But let the past&#xD;

sweet cousin, from your height, see far enough into my&#xD;
lowly little Quaker girl to do her justice. That you will,&#xD;
by-and'.by, I am sure, or you are not so good as I believe&#xD;
you to be. It is unreasonable, though, to detain you&#xD;
longer. It is time you should retire. Oh, you. can not&#xD;
know how much good y~u have done. me! No, no,"&#xD;
added he, interpreting rightly her arch smile, "not by&#xD;
'your rejection, but by your sympathy. Good..' night,&#xD;
dear Eleanor?'&#xD;
They parted-.-Philip to ponder on his grandfather's&#xD;
reception of his failure, Eleanor to "moralize the spec-&#xD;
tacle" in her own way.&#xD;
With her associations and education she could not but&#xD;
be somewhat shocked.by so incongruous a union. But,&#xD;
though trained in habits of filial respect. and obedience,&#xD;
hers had been "a. reasQnable service"-not under the&#xD;
iron rule of the preceding generation, nor yet lowered&#xD;
to the modern familiarity, by which a perfect equality is&#xD;
established between parent and child. She could, thei~e-&#xD;
fore, see the conflict of duties in 'the present case, and&#xD;
the enfeebling effect on a naturally generous and manly&#xD;
temper of a system that inspired. no confidence.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
THE next morning the breakfast passed cheerfully.&#xD;
No cloud rose even "as big as a man's hand.". Mr.&#xD;
Lawrence, understanding that the young people had had&#xD;
a long ~-t~te evening, concluded that, if Phil were not&#xD;
a booby, ~he had opened the business; and, if so, their&#xD;
present amicable relations justified a hope of the happi.'&#xD;
est result. In this belief; he directed his grandson to at-&#xD;
tend his toilet.&#xD;
A f~kv words served to demolish the castle that years&#xD;
had built. At first it was difficult to say where the bolt&#xD;
of his anger would fall-on Eleanor for refusing, or on&#xD;
Philip for being refused. When, however, the ~mily&#xD;
met at dinner, a more discriminating justice than was to&#xD;
be expected directed it entirely against Eleanor, who,&#xD;
though aware that her decision would pain her grand-&#xD;
father, had no apprehension of the manner in which it&#xD;
would be evinced. This was not long doubtful. Mr.&#xD;
Lawrence, having had a slight touch of Eleanor's spirit&#xD;
in her defense of Phyllis, rather shrunk from a fair fight&#xD;
with her; but this he made up for by a series of small&#xD;
attacks, the more vexatious as they could be neither re-&#xD;
pelled nor noticed. Instead of the greeting, at once kind&#xD;
and playful, with which he usually seated her at table,&#xD;
she took a place unheeded. No nice morsel solicitously&#xD;
selected, and sent to her unasked, she remained unat-&#xD;
tended to, till PhyUi~, having stood some time, ~plate.in&#xD;
hand, purposely unseen, at length was carelessly asked,&#xD;

serving.'maid she was. Instead of the accustomed glass&#xD;

of wine with her grandfather, not a word was addressed&#xD;
to her. She was, in short, made to feel as much as pos-&#xD;
~ible, by negations of every kind, how entirely the sun&#xD;
of her favor was set. Not that this was really so. Mr.&#xD;
Lawrence could not so easily abandon a cherished proj-&#xD;
ect. He flattered himself Eleanor's refusal was a mere&#xD;
girlish freak to prove her power; or that Philip had been&#xD;
precipitate, and that a little more tune and intercourse&#xD;
would excite the corresponding feeling on her parts Of&#xD;
Phil's indifference he had not the least suspicion. He&#xD;
thought him, indeed, not so passionate a wooer as he&#xD;
himself would be in the like case; but this he imputed&#xD;
to the change of manners-the execrable decay of all&#xD;
true gallantry and devotion; all owing to the French&#xD;
Revolution, with which, Democrat as he was, he had be-.&#xD;
come thoroughly disgusted. Oh! had he known the&#xD;
fact! Still hoping for success, he thought that, in the&#xD;
mean time, it would not be amiss to show Eleanor, by&#xD;
the temporary withdrawal of his favor, how much it was&#xD;
really worth.&#xD;
It would be difficult to say who suffered most by the&#xD;
experiment, Eleanor or his grandson. She, grieved and&#xD;
oppressed, the tears ready to fall from eyes that she did&#xD;
not dare to turn toward Mr. Lawrence, her dinner near-.&#xD;
ly untouched, yet not presuming to leave the table, sat&#xD;
like a culprit; while Philip, unprepared for this dis~.&#xD;
pleasure, felt self-condemned that he did not share it&#xD;
with her.&#xD;
The cloth was removed, but no cordiality nor pleas.&#xD;
axitry succeeded. No remembrance of "absent friends"&#xD;
to draw the nearer those who were present. No repeti-.&#xD;
tion of his jocose and favorite toast,&#xD;
"Here's to our friends! but as to our foes,&#xD;
Short shoes, and corns on their toes!"&#xD;
Only a joyless formality, unbrGken except by an occa-&#xD;
&#xD;
sional remark addressed to his daughter or to Philip....-.&#xD;
never to Eleanor.&#xD;
Unable longer to endure this, she left the table as soon&#xD;
as was admissible, taking refuge in the drawing-room,&#xD;
whence a view of the river suggested to her an escape,&#xD;
on which she was reflecting, when Philip, with a dis-&#xD;
tressed countenance, entered.&#xD;
"Eleanor," said he, "I can not bear this. I will con~&#xD;
fess every thing. It is base to let you suffer when I am&#xD;
the only one in fault. I will at least share your dis-&#xD;
grace."&#xD;
"No, no, on no account. To involve you Would not&#xD;
help me. I suffer, 'tis true, unjustly, but still for my own&#xD;
act, which nothing that you could have done would have&#xD;
prevented. Be easy; you are guiltless in regard to me.&#xD;
Nay, I insist on your silence. In a few days I shall be&#xD;
at home, and shall forget these troubles. Bya.and.by,&#xD;
when the storm has passed, I'll come again, if grand-&#xD;
papa will let me. In the mean time, you must come to&#xD;
us, and I will introduce you to some right pleasant young&#xD;
persons, and we will have merry times again."&#xD;
But her amiable efforts to console him only increased&#xD;
his concern1 The idea of her leaving them was intolerk&#xD;
able. She had "made it sunshine in a shady place."&#xD;
lie had known a pleasure in her companionship lie could&#xD;
not now do with out, especially in the involvement of his&#xD;
present anxiety; but, declaring her departure impera..&#xD;
tive, Eleanor retired to her rodm to write to her mother.&#xD;
here she had hardly seated herself before a gentle tap&#xD;
announced her aunt.&#xD;
"My dear child," said she, "I am so grieved Papa&#xD;
has told me all. Poor Phil! I knc v not which is most&#xD;
to be pitied, he or myself."&#xD;
Eleanor could not Suppress a smile. "Dear aunt~&#xD;

heart on my account; and you, I hope, will find conso-&#xD;
lation in some one much better than your insensible&#xD;
niece."&#xD;
"Oh no, Eleanor, never. You can not comprehend&#xD;
the happiness you have shed on my solitary life. The&#xD;
hope 'of keeping you here has been to me like the fabu-&#xD;
lous elixir. But you were about to write-not to your&#xD;
mother ?"&#xD;
"Yes; to inform her of my return."&#xD;
"That is just what I am sent to prevent. Papa de-&#xD;
sires she may not know what has passed, and that you&#xD;
will, not think ~f leaving Rosenberg at present."&#xD;
"Oh, I must got"&#xD;
"But, my dear! The wishes of papa are con~mands,&#xD;
you know.~,&#xD;
"Commands 1" repeated. Eleanor; "commands that I&#xD;
shall not go, nor write to my 9Wn mother 1"&#xD;
"Yes~ even so; here his 'word is law."&#xD;
"Oh, dear aunt! perhaps 'tis disrespectful to say so,&#xD;
but I can, not help it. You've all made grandpapa a&#xD;
tyrant by' your slavish fears. He would be just and&#xD;
reasonable, I am sure, had. he not been spoiled by this&#xD;
irrati~tial submission. Do, dearest aunt, be a little more&#xD;
resolute for his sake."'&#xD;
Miss Lawrence did not answer, and. Eleanor saw, by&#xD;
her closed eyes and contracted brow, that some painful.&#xD;
thought occupied her.&#xD;
"'Tis too latel too late P' said she, at length, rather&#xD;
refie~ting than speaking to another; "Life has passed.&#xD;
me by; I can not now arrest the stream. If I have&#xD;
made a mistake, it has not been wholly from the weak-&#xD;
ness you ascribe it to. But let us speak of' yourself,&#xD;
Eleanor. fly complying with papa's request you will&#xD;
soothe his present irritation; by refusing, you' will re-&#xD;
open the breach with your parents so lately elos~d~&#xD;
&#xD;
ft&#xD;
&#xD;
This, I think, will reconcile you to the surrender of your&#xD;
own wishes. As to Philip, he will not be deceived into&#xD;
a vain hope by your remaining; he will understand that&#xD;
it is compulsory."&#xD;
"Oh," said Eleanor, with an irrepressible laugh, "I&#xD;
am not deterred by fear of any such consequence. Phil&#xD;
and Ii perfectly comprehend each other."&#xD;
Miss Lawrence cast a glance on her, half-reproachful,&#xD;
and, rising, said, "Well, my dear, you will, at least, allow&#xD;
me to tell papa that you consent."&#xD;
"Yes; with one reserve, I will not write. I will re-&#xD;
main, but not to be treated as I was to-day. I wish&#xD;
never to fail in respect and obedience to grandpapa; and,&#xD;
therefore, I dare not subject myself to what I know I&#xD;
could not patiently bear."&#xD;
To complicate matters, the gout appeared-the result&#xD;
of nervous agitation-and Mr. Lawrence was confined to&#xD;
his chamber.&#xD;
Eleanor sent to beg she might be admitted to read, as&#xD;
usual, but the offer was declined, and in such a manner&#xD;
that it was plain she would not soon be permitted to&#xD;
have the privilege.&#xD;
Several days passed, during which it was~b'y no means&#xD;
easy to preserve the peace in Mr. Lawrence's sick-room.&#xD;
The attack was not violent, and at intervals he might,&#xD;
if he would; have found a solace in an agreeable book;&#xD;
but neither the offers of his daughter nor of Philip were&#xD;
accepted. Mrs. Dorothy very humbly proffered her serv-&#xD;
ices, bu~t only to be rejected. At length, after ponder-&#xD;
ing and hesitating, she ventured to say,&#xD;
"I do believe I have thought of what may suit you,&#xD;
sir. Suppose you try Priscilla Dale, sir."&#xD;
"Priscilla Dale! Pshaw! nonsense! She'd drive me&#xD;
mad 1"&#xD;
"Why, sir, she's an excellent reader! Miss Lawrence&#xD;

took ever so much pains with her, and she came every&#xD;
day to read to her when she used to be so poorly. .Pear&#xD;
me! Pm sure nobody'd 'a thought then that she'd live&#xD;
to see this day! You haven't forgot that time, sir, Pm&#xD;
sure."&#xD;
woman 1" exclaimed Mr. Lawrence, violently;&#xD;
"and, if I had, you would never cease to remind me.&#xD;
No'; I won't have Priscilla Dale!"&#xD;
Her habitual fear overcome by her real desire to re-&#xD;
lieve him, Mrs. Dorothy ventured a little farther, and&#xD;
suggested that Mr. Philip ~might ask her to come "jvist&#xD;
ontrial."&#xD;
But Phil, alarmed at the idea of such an embassy, cer-&#xD;
tain, too, to fail in his hands, answered, hastily,&#xD;
"No, no, Mrs. Dorothy, that will never do; she won't&#xD;
come!"&#xD;
These few words settled. the matter.&#xD;
"Won't come! won't come 1" repeated Mr. Lawrence,&#xD;
"when I s&amp;amp;nd! a girl whd owes every thing to us! Pd&#xD;
like to see her refuse! Go to her this instant, Phil, and&#xD;
tell 'her to come to me. I'll try her, if only to punish&#xD;
her pride."&#xD;
There was nothing to be done but to appear to obey;&#xD;
when, to his great relief, Miss Lawrence undertook to&#xD;
dispatch a note, which, she doubted not, would bring&#xD;
her; and,'while this. ison its way, it may not be amiss to&#xD;
peep~ into the neat little domidil whither it is traveling.'&#xD;
About two miles from Rosenberg was the "Mill&#xD;
Farm." The mill, whence, it 'derived it~ name,' tur~d'&#xD;
by a never-failing stream, together with ihe good' char-&#xD;
acter of the miller and his meal, had secured the custom&#xD;
of the country round for many miles.&#xD;
Joseph Pale, the occupant, a Quaker, who had' many&#xD;
years before left England a poor man, had, by industry&#xD;
and thrift, arrive. at what to him was eonipetence----a&#xD;

&#xD;
respectable living, with something" laid by for a rainy&#xD;
day." He had at first a hard struggle; but Mr. Law-&#xD;
rence, of whom he had taken a long lease on easy terms,&#xD;
had been not only an indulgent landlord, but a good&#xD;
friend. With improving circumstances Mr. Dale had&#xD;
carried out his English and Quaker tastes. The rude,&#xD;
ill-constructed, weather-beaten house had been repaired,&#xD;
painted, an4 bettered in many Ways. The little walk&#xD;
which conducted from it to the mill had'been shaded by&#xD;
a row of trees; and a garden, at the 'foot of which his&#xD;
Pactolus-the mill-stream-glided along, was always the&#xD;
best and the earliest in the' neighborhood. Fences, out-&#xD;
houses, and land, all showed his intelligent care; and,&#xD;
when driving his sister and daughter in his capacious&#xD;
chaise, drawn by a sleek, well-fed horse, in a suit of gray&#xD;
not unlike their ownthey presented altogether an im-&#xD;
age of comfort and respectability that some of their rich.&#xD;
er neighbors might have envied.&#xD;
~ATithin, the dwelling was the very temple of neat-&#xD;
ness, of which Esther Dale and Priscilla were the priest-&#xD;
esses; and Martha, an orphan girl, at first taken for char-&#xD;
ity, now their only help, was a faithful ministrant.&#xD;
Esther Dale, a woman of sense and feeling, with a&#xD;
good plain education, had been, though not a preacher,&#xD;
an occasional exhorter, when so "moved." This gave&#xD;
to her ma~iner and language an increased precision, to&#xD;
which was added an attachment to her sect that narrow-&#xD;
ed her views of the "world's people." By this last her&#xD;
niece was unaffected, though she had naturally caught&#xD;
something of the former. Her brother, not less honest,&#xD;
was more liberal. He had seen sufficient cause to be-&#xD;
lieve that goodness was not found only under a broad&#xD;
brim and a drab coat; and, while an attentive observer&#xD;
of the forms of a people who profess to discard form, he&#xD;
did, not believe in their essential importance.&#xD;

WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
On the afternoon alluded to, Priscilla and her aunt-&#xD;
the day's work over-were in their quiet little "sitting.&#xD;
roomy" the Windows of which, opening to the poet's cor-&#xD;
ner, the sweet southwest, disclosed a small flower-garden&#xD;
spread beneath them. Here, as if that instinct of beauty&#xD;
implanted in the human breast would vindicate itself,&#xD;
were to be seen the gayest combinations of colors; and&#xD;
sober eyes, that turned from all the glories of earth,&#xD;
could not shut out the gorgeous hues and the brilliant&#xD;
lights 6f the evening sky.&#xD;
On the hearth&#xD;
"The kettle whispering its foint under-song"&#xD;
gave note of preparation for their early tea. The floor,&#xD;
white and scantily carpeted, and the polished pine ta-&#xD;
bles, attested the patient labors of Martha. At every&#xD;
door little mats of list-home manufactory-mounted&#xD;
guard to defend the sacred precincts from gravel aird&#xD;
soil. Chairs of the prevailing straight, high - backed&#xD;
form, but of inexpensive bilested wood, well oiled, were&#xD;
a good substitute for mahogany. There was literally no&#xD;
article of ornament in the room. On one side hung a&#xD;
map of Great Britain-left, but not forgotten I on the&#xD;
other was a small bilsted press, the upper part a book-&#xD;
ease, containing their literary staple, with drawers be-&#xD;
low, whose brass handles shone resplendent.&#xD;
Among the books were "A History of tJie People&#xD;
called 'Quakers,' by William Sewall;" "Journal of the&#xD;
Life and Travels of ~eorg~,Fox ;" "The History of the&#xD;
Life, of Thomas ElIwood;" Barclay's "Apology for the&#xD;
true Christian Divinity, as the same is held forth and&#xD;
preached by the people called in scorn 'Quakers;"'&#xD;
"Life of William Penn ;" "No Cross, no Crown ;" Wil-&#xD;
liam Penn's "Rules for the Regulation of his Family, or&#xD;
Christian Discipline; or, Good and Wholesome Orders&#xD;
for the well-governing of the same ;" Biographies and&#xD;

&#xD;
Experiences of several eminent Quakers; "Guthrie's&#xD;
Gazetteer," and "Entick's Dictionary."&#xD;
From a volume in Esther's hand, she was reading&#xD;
aloud to Priscilla, seated by her side, sewing "fine linen"&#xD;
for her father, who, despising "embroidery and vain ap-&#xD;
parel," moderately indulged in this luxury. The pas-&#xD;
sage selected was a portion of the beautiful letter ad-&#xD;
dressed by Penn to his wife and children previous to his&#xD;
first embarkation for this country.&#xD;
j Hearken, Priscilla," said her aunt, "to this godly&#xD;
and wise man. 'Agriculture I. especially commend.&#xD;
Let my children be husbandmen and housewives; it is&#xD;
industrious, healthy, honest, and of good example. Like&#xD;
Abraham and the holy ancients, who pleased God and&#xD;
obtained a good report."'&#xD;
"Yes," said Priscilla; "he was, I doubt not, a wise&#xD;
man, and as full of love as of wisdom; for in the con~&#xD;
clusion of this same letter those tender words meet us,&#xD;
that have always dwelt in my memory. 'Yours,' he&#xD;
saith to his wife, 'yours in that which no waters can&#xD;
quench, no time forget, nor distance wear away, but re-&#xD;
maineth forever!"~&#xD;
"But thou must remember Priscilla," said Esther,&#xD;
with a scrutinizing look~ "that the love of which he thus&#xD;
speaketh was bred of a godly mind; and observe, far-&#xD;
ther, how he enforceth this. For, advising of his children,&#xD;
he saith, 'When marriageable, see that they have worthy&#xD;
persons in their eye; of good life, and good fame for&#xD;
piety and understanding.' Now, by 'understanding,' it&#xD;
is manifest that he meant not carnal gifts; for what doth&#xD;
Scripture say ?.-' A good understanding have all they&#xD;
that love thy ~&#xD;
Priscilla, not inclined to a conversation the tendency&#xD;
whereof she was well aware, was glad to be relieved by'&#xD;

Esther. observed her closely. She marked her vary-&#xD;
ing color and startled look. But Priscilla, taught to con-&#xD;
- trol her emotions, soon recovered her usual calm exte-&#xD;
rior, and, having dismissed Pomp to await her answer,&#xD;
she handed the note to her aunt. She read it, and re-&#xD;
turned it without 'comment, saying, "Is the young man&#xD;
Philip at home?"&#xD;
"Not often, I think. He spendeth much time in the&#xD;
wopds, and on the river." -&#xD;
"Verily, a gainful occupation !" replied Esther, coldly.&#xD;
"Slaughtering God's harmless creatures for his amuse-*&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
Now it is not to be inferred that she disliked Philip.&#xD;
On the contrary, she was no exception to the general fa-&#xD;
vor he found: £&#xD;
"With eye so merry, and a foot so light,&#xD;
That none could chide his gamesomeness."&#xD;
She had, indeed, often rebuked his taste for what she&#xD;
ccr~sidered murderous sports, held in abhorrence by her&#xD;
sect; yet once, wheft her brother had been left by a&#xD;
wasting feverwith a sickly appetite, she gladly received&#xD;
the frequent bag of game, nor scrupulously counted the&#xD;
little lives that went to 1111 it. Nor would any one so&#xD;
surely raise a smile on her habitually grave face as "the&#xD;
young man Philip."&#xD;
But those days were past. A woman's instinct, surer&#xD;
than "Suspicion's hundred eyes," had alarmed her for her&#xD;
niece; and, together with her desireto promote her main&#xD;
riage with a tl~riving young Quaker suitor, led her to&#xD;
discourage an intimacy which she feared could only pro~&#xD;
duce unhappiness. For' this reason she had favored the&#xD;
long sojourn, among their distant friends; and, perceive~&#xD;
ing that Philip's visits were not renewed, she hoped the&#xD;
danger was passed. The request of Miss Lawrence was&#xD;
therefore as unpleasant as unexpected~&#xD;

A PEEP AT TIlE PAST.&#xD;

&#xD;
Priscilla did not reply to her ai~nt~s unfavorable ob-&#xD;
servation, but looked perplexed and uneasy.&#xD;
"I see7" said Est~her, "that thy spirit is troubled with-&#xD;
in thee. Thou hast a divided mind between duty to&#xD;
thy friend Gertrude and to thyself."&#xD;
Priscilla did not confirm, though ~she could not deny,&#xD;
her aunt's assertion.&#xD;
"My child," continued, Esther, earn~st1y, "spread her&#xD;
letter, like Rabshakeh's, 'before the Lord,' and verily&#xD;
thou shalt be heard. Be not disheartened; thou know-&#xD;
est, £ No cross, no crown.~~~&#xD;
"J will do as my father shall advise," replied Priscil-&#xD;
la, hearing his approaching footstep; and, as he entered,&#xD;
she put the note into his hand, saying, "I wish to dom&#xD;
this matter, father, as seemeth best unto thee."&#xD;
Now Joseph IIi~ale' was too busy with mill and farm,&#xD;
and the cares, large and small, of his industrious life, to&#xD;
have time for close in-door observation. It had proba-&#xD;
bly never crossed his mind to question .what the visits of&#xD;
Philip might tend to, continued, as they had been, from&#xD;
his childhood. "He was," he thought, "a sensible lad,&#xD;
and a good one; and, moreover, his laughter was pleas-&#xD;
ant to the hearer ;" for, from under the restraint of Quak-&#xD;
er manners, there often wells forth a spring of mirth&#xD;
that mingles readily with its like. Nor was his scrutiny&#xD;
quickened by the religions zeal of his sister. He was&#xD;
well aware that as yet Priscilla's conformity consisted&#xD;
only in "dress and address." He could wish it other-&#xD;
wise, but this "was not for him to bring to pass." Had&#xD;
he feared that sh~ was in danger of violating her own&#xD;
convictions, he would have been much disturbed. But&#xD;
habits, the result of education merely, must, he knew,&#xD;
be liable to change; and he held that she could yet be&#xD;
a Christian woman, even though her speech and apparel&#xD;
were altered.&#xD;

&#xD;
Having read the note, he replied, "I marvel what thee&#xD;
means? Friend Lawrence and his daughter have* never&#xD;
failed to us; and, if they desire this small favor at thy&#xD;
hands, I should be Iot~h to deny them. Go, therefore, of&#xD;
a certainty."&#xD;
Esther, by look rather than word~ expressed a demur-&#xD;
rer, which Joseph perceiving said, "That is, if thy aunt&#xD;
can spare thee. II would not have her cumbered by too&#xD;
much serving, yet, rather than thee should say nay in this&#xD;
.matter, I advise thee to seek some one. to assist her in&#xD;
thy stead."&#xD;
Esther knew her brother well enough to understand&#xD;
that, once having decided, he' was little likely to change&#xD;
his opinion; and, as in such a case words would be use-&#xD;
less, she, with her usual dislike to superfluous expendi-&#xD;
ture, spared them, and Priscilla dismissed Pomp with&#xD;
the desired answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
~ next day, as Eleanor was alone in the parlor, ab-&#xD;
sorbed in a book, the door opened, but so noiselessly&#xD;
that she was not aware of the entrance of any one till a&#xD;
near step drew her attention; and, turning, she found&#xD;
herself confronted by 'a young girl whom she had never&#xD;
before seen. She was apparently not much older than&#xD;
herself, lower in stature, but of such fair proportions,&#xD;
and so erect a carriage, that height was not necessary to&#xD;
confer dignity. Nor had her natural' flexibility of limb&#xD;
and movement been repressed by the primness of her&#xD;
dress. This was a gown of gray chambray---a silk and&#xD;
cotton material, then mtwh used-with' the long, tight&#xD;
Quaker waist, unrelieved' by any garniture; a muslin&#xD;
handkerchief crossed over her breast, sleeves tight to be-&#xD;
low the elbow, and there met by long gray kid mitts.&#xD;
Her gown was just short enough to show that she wore&#xD;
the low "spring-heels," not in order to affect height, but&#xD;
for greater neatness. She had a shawl of the same color,&#xD;
and a bonnet of the Quaker fashion; but from under it&#xD;
looked out a pair of eyes in strange contrast with this&#xD;
sad-colored attire. They were of that form and color&#xD;
described as "Italian," soft as the dole's, but in their&#xD;
rich depths a fire burned. Her brow was strongly mark-&#xD;
ed, and, in keeping with her mouth, gave more of char-&#xD;
acter and firmness to her face than beauty. J3ut a clear&#xD;
and smooth complexion-the usual accompaniment of&#xD;
her dark auburn hair-~--atoned for any irregularities;&#xD;
rendering the whole, though not faultless, at once strik-&#xD;
ing and pleasing-a face which, if it could not defy crit-&#xD;
icism, was sure of admiration.&#xD;

WALTER THoa~LEY; OR,&#xD;
Eleanor was n6t long in doubt as to who she was.&#xD;
"Well," thought she, "if Cousin Philip could afford&#xD;
to be silent about her external charms, she must have a&#xD;
great deal besides."&#xD;
"Miss Dale, is it not?" said she, offering her hand.&#xD;
"Not so," replied the young girl.; "Priscilla Dale&#xD;
better pleaseth me. And thou art__"&#xD;
"Eleanor Meredith."&#xD;
~ "So I did suppose."&#xD;
Having, placed a chair for her, Eleanor assisted in re-&#xD;
moving her hat, and saw, admiringly, the little white&#xD;
cypress gauze cap that shaded, but could not conceal her&#xD;
rich hair.&#xD;
The few commonplaces exchanged about weather,&#xD;
walking, etc., both were silent. Eleanor thought she&#xD;
perceived the impress of Miss Lawrence in. the refine-&#xD;
in~nt of her voice and manner, and in the accuracy of&#xD;
her speech-free from the usual Quaker offenses against&#xD;
grammar ; but, fearing to embarrass, restrained her de-&#xD;
sire to look at'~ her; while Priscilla fixed her eyes on&#xD;
Eleanor, not with the gaze of ill-bred curiosity, but a sad&#xD;
intentness that betrayed a more than common interest.&#xD;
-To a person curious in the effect of modes of thought&#xD;
on manners, they might have been a profitable study.&#xD;
The one, unspoiled by the world, but not ignorant of its&#xD;
prescriptions-neither selfish nor arrogant, yet not indif-&#xD;
ferent to her advantages of wealth and position-was con-&#xD;
strained, from the fear of doing either too little or too&#xD;
much. The other, undisturbed by a question for her&#xD;
already settled, not by propriety or expediency, but on&#xD;
groundsfar higher, was calm and self-possessed. Taught&#xD;
to honor no man for external distinctions, she was un-&#xD;
moved in their presence, and was absorbed in far dif-&#xD;
ferent reflections as she continued her observations of&#xD;
Eleanor.&#xD;
&#xD;
279&#xD;
&#xD;
"She is surely comely to~behold," she thought. "It&#xD;
is no marvel that she should find favor inki~ eyes; but,&#xD;
unless her face. belie her, she has that also~ which is&#xD;
better."&#xD;
The entrance of Miss La~vrence gave a new direction.&#xD;
to their thoughts. Priscilla warmed into animation,&#xD;
and approaching her, took her extended hand between&#xD;
hers, and, in reply, to her friend's kind greeting, replied,&#xD;
"It rejQiceth me to see thee." Then, gazing on her&#xD;
lovingly, she added, "and thou art well too, and strong,&#xD;
and young-alm.ost as young and fair as this thy&#xD;
niece."&#xD;
"Ahi Priscilla," said Miss Lawrence, tappingher cheek,&#xD;
"how have you, under the safeguard of a Quaker cap,&#xD;
learned to flatter ?"&#xD;
"Flatter !" repeated Priscilla, with a smile; "nay, not.&#xD;
so. I have heard a man, learned in the law, tell my fa-&#xD;
ther that evil words, if not false, were no libel. Then&#xD;
fair words, if true, are no flattery. Are we aff6wed to&#xD;
utter truth only when it giveth pain ?"&#xD;
"The truth-that is just the question. I own, how-&#xD;
ever, I am, in health at least, much improved. My niece&#xD;
has been my best physician. But," added Miss Law-&#xD;
rence, with a look of kind scrutiny, "you are a little&#xD;
thinner, and rather paler. What have those strict Penn-&#xD;
sylvania friends been doing with you? I am glad to&#xD;
see, however, that my favorite hair has not turned- Quaker&#xD;
yet."&#xD;
&#xD;
"No," said Priscilla, with a smile, smoothing away&#xD;

for an instant offered no excuse, while Eleanor, moved&#xD;
by pity and curiosity, listened for her answer.&#xD;
"It hath not been my fault, but it hath been a sore&#xD;
grief to me. I know thou wilt pardon me if I can not&#xD;
farther satisfy thee."&#xD;
Miss Lawrence, supposing it to be some restrictions on&#xD;
the part of her aunt, who feared any influence at vari-&#xD;
ance with Quakerism, set the matter at rest by saying,&#xD;
"You deserve my confidence, Priscilla, because you nev-&#xD;
er doubt it. And now let us go to papa, who expects&#xD;
you in his room, because not well enough to leave it."&#xD;
She led the way, and Priscilla prepared to follow her,&#xD;
but Eleanor could not part with her thus.&#xD;
"Let us," said she, "be better acquainted. When y6u&#xD;
have the time, will you come to see me too, and allow&#xD;
me'to visit you ?"&#xD;
"It is kindly spoken of thee, Eleanor, but it is, never-&#xD;
theless, not best for thee, nor for me, thus to do. Do&#xD;
not thinkme unthankful; I feel that I should love thee&#xD;
well, were it permitted. Farewell I" and she was gone.&#xD;
"So,~~ thought Eleanor; "my overtures rejected by&#xD;
the little maid of the mill! but what a majesty there is&#xD;
in truth and simplicity! Now I, in the same circum-&#xD;
stances, would have gone beating about for excuses, in&#xD;
order not to compromise myself by an allusion to the&#xD;
real fact. She comes directly to the point. 'It is not&#xD;
best for thee nor for me,' in which,, too, she would be&#xD;
perfectly right were matters as she probably believes;&#xD;
that is, ff1 were indeed her rival. Ishall make another&#xD;
attempt, however."&#xD;
F~r this ~there was no opportunity.. Priscilla came&#xD;
daily at the appointed hour, but was immediately con-&#xD;
ducted to Mr. Lawrence's room, whence, when dismiss-&#xD;
ed, she left the house as noiselessly t~s she came. And&#xD;
~wlien, in the course of a week, he was so far better that&#xD;
&#xD;
he received her in the parlor, it was evidently expected&#xD;
that Eleanor should withdraw; for, though his displeas-&#xD;
ure was now oniy manifested by a punctilious politeness,&#xD;
it was not abated.&#xD;
Pained by this seclusion, and the strange position as-&#xD;
signed her, still Eleanor could not but admit the happy&#xD;
effect of the present arrangement on her grandfather.&#xD;
Whether that he had a secret satisfaction in the infliction&#xD;
of condign punishment on her, or the tranquilizing ways&#xD;
of the little Quaker-her gentle tones, the sedative effect&#xD;
of her phraseology, her good reading, her immovable&#xD;
placidity, which seemed to act like oil on ruffled waters~-&#xD;
or her beauty, which; he having seen little of her of late,&#xD;
appeared to4ake him by surprise-or all together, could&#xD;
not be saidi ~Certain it was, however, that, like "the lit-&#xD;
tle maid carried away captive out of the land of Israel,"&#xD;
she had brought healing to the house. The gout disap-&#xD;
peared, and an unusual calm succeeded.&#xD;
One day, as ~Eleanor had j ust made her compulsory&#xD;
exit from the parlor, she was met by Philip in the hall,&#xD;
who stealthily giving her a signal, she followed him into&#xD;
the drawing-room.&#xD;
"Eleanor," said he, "I must speak to you! IDo you&#xD;
know that Mrs. Dorothy says that grandpapa is quite&#xD;
taken with Priscilla, who, as she tells me, 'has bewitch-&#xD;
ed the old gentleman.' This has put new hope into me:&#xD;
what if she should so gain his favor as to overcome his&#xD;
objections ?"&#xD;
." Well, but, my good cousin," replied Eleanor, mis-&#xD;
chievously, "how could that help you? You say that&#xD;
Priscilla is herself inexorable."&#xD;
"Oh, she would not be so-.-you know she could not&#xD;
-if every obstacle were removed."&#xD;
"But-another thing, Philip-how can you be sure&#xD;
that Priscilla may not play 'The Irish Widow 'in earn-&#xD;

est, and, finding she has captivated the grandfather, sac-&#xD;
rifice the grandson ?"&#xD;
"Why-why-you don't-what do you mean, Ele-&#xD;
anor ?" exclaimed he, gasping with alarm and astonish-&#xD;
ment; " what can you mean&#xD;
"Only just what I say: I, of course, am ignorant of&#xD;
all such things; but mamma, who knows the world, oft-&#xD;
en declares that no marriage would ever surprise her-&#xD;
/     That the wisest and the silliest, the oldest and the young-&#xD;
est, are equally unreliable in this matter."&#xD;
"Well, but, Eleanoi you distress me; don't talk so;&#xD;
'tis absurd: do be serious?'&#xD;
"I am serious, and, moreover, quite reasonable. Pris-&#xD;
cilla has rejected you. She is, therefore, as you ihust&#xD;
admit, perfectly at liberty. Grandpapa is a handsome7&#xD;
hale old gentleman, and, when~ he chooses, can be cap-&#xD;
tivating. More than this, she considers you engaged to&#xD;
me, which, of course, you ought to be, if people ever did&#xD;
in matrimony what they ought to do. It is not my&#xD;
place to undeceive her, and you can not, becauSe she&#xD;
has sent you to Coventry. Now, before we can all&#xD;
stand in our proper places, grandpapa, who thinks that&#xD;
every thing, like murder, 'if it were done, it is well it&#xD;
were done quickly,' will have the banns published, and&#xD;
yell and i[ will be invited to~walk as 'chiefmourners.~~~&#xD;
"If I thought such a thing possible," exclaimed Phil-&#xD;
ip, "I would-"&#xD;
"Fall down and worship me! I suppose," interrupted&#xD;
Eleanor with mock gravity; "but I warn you, my god-&#xD;
desship would be iminovable"&#xD;
"No, no I" replied he, passionately; "I would tear&#xD;
her from my~ heart, and never more have faith in wom-&#xD;
an! But I won't think of it. 'Tis an absurdity! You&#xD;
don't believe it; you can not."&#xD;
believee nothing, because I have nothing on which&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT TIXE PAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
28&amp;amp;&#xD;
&#xD;
to found belief., You ought to know how far you.can&#xD;
trust her. But no, dear Philip, do not look so distress-&#xD;
ed;I am only taking my revenge on you and grand-&#xD;
papa. Priscilla's face can not deceive. She may be&#xD;
firm even to obstinacy, but never mercenary or heart-&#xD;
less."&#xD;
Philip, though rejecting what his better sense assured&#xD;
him did not deserve a thought, could not be quite easy&#xD;
undei these suggestions, even when retracted. - He re-&#xD;
flected on all the extraordinary marriages of which he&#xD;
had ever heard, till he almost persuaded himself that&#xD;
this one was possible. His situation, tantalizing before&#xD;
.--daily under the same roof with Priscilla, yet not dar.!&#xD;
ing to speak to her-became now intolerabk~, and he re-&#xD;
solved, at all hazards; to see her.&#xD;
Accordingly, the next morning, when, having per~&#xD;
formed her usual duty, she was on her return, and pro.&#xD;
feeding through the wood which separated her from her&#xD;
home, she heard steps behind, and feared that she was&#xD;
followed. She would not betray it, however, ev~n by a&#xD;
look, but pursued her way, as if unconscious. They&#xD;
gained on her-they were at her side-still, she neither&#xD;
turned her head nor raised her eyes.&#xD;
In the days~f their childhood, Philip had playfully&#xD;
imitated her mode of speech. Affection h ad adopted&#xD;
what sport began.&#xD;
"Priscilla !" at length, he said, in a hesitating voice;&#xD;
"Priscilla! may I not speakto thee I"&#xD;
She was silent, and again he entreated.&#xD;
Without slackening her pace or raising her eyes, she'&#xD;
at length replied, "I have neither might nor 'right to.&#xD;
y&#xD;
prevent thy speaking; but let it be what befits thee to&#xD;
say, and me to hear."&#xD;
"Oh, Priscilla! thou knowest that there is but one&#xD;
thing* I can say-forgive me! Be again to me what&#xD;

thou hast so long been! Thou, whom only I have loved,&#xD;
or can ever love !"&#xD;
She stopped sudderJy, and, turning toward him a face&#xD;
pale but unmoved, said deliberately and coldly, "Thy&#xD;
grandfather is pleased to require at my hand certain&#xD;
small services, the which I gladly render; but I will not&#xD;
again cross his threshold unless thou leave me."&#xD;
"Say, then, only that thou dost not hate me; nay, hate&#xD;
meif thou wilt: any thing but this deadly coldness."&#xD;
may not vex myself at thy bidding," she replied.&#xD;
"Priscilla, I can not bear this. Accuse me! scorn&#xD;
me! any thing that shows human feeling 1"&#xD;
But no word was returned; she only walked faster,&#xD;
as if anxious to escape him.&#xD;
Stung by her manner past endurance, and, for the&#xD;
moment, yielding to the suspicions that had been in~&#xD;
fused into him, he placed himself in her path, and ex-&#xD;
claimed, with ~violence, "It i~ so! I understand you at'&#xD;
last; do not think to blind me; I am sacrificed, not to&#xD;
a just resentment, but to your ambition! Poor and d&amp;amp;&#xD;
pendent as I am, you do well to cast me off for one&#xD;
who, if more than three times your age, can make you&#xD;
mistress of Rosenberg !"&#xD;
The words were hardly uttered before they were re-&#xD;
pented. The lightning that shot from those dark eyes&#xD;
brought quick conviction of her indignant innocence,,.&#xD;
a~idof his own folly.&#xD;
"I thank thee, Philip Lawrence," she said; "thou hast&#xD;
done me thy last and best favor; thou hast extinguished&#xD;
the .small spark of kindness that yet warmed my heart&#xD;
toWard thee."&#xD;
Humbled and alarmed, he implored her pardon, and&#xD;
attempted to take her hand; but, disengaging it, she ex-&#xD;
claimed, "Let me pass! thy path and mine here part for.,&#xD;
ever! Let me pass."&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.          285&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, Priscilla! canst thou leave me thus, without a&#xD;
word, or hope of forgiveness? I am wretched! Pity,&#xD;
if thou wilt not l6ve me. Tell. me what Ii can do to&#xD;
show thee my repentance."&#xD;
A slight tremor of ~~er voice betrayed the effect of&#xD;
this appeal, but her manner was unchanged.&#xD;
"All that I ask at thy hands is that thou hinder me&#xD;
not in my duty to thy grandfather."&#xD;
Philip no longer ventured to oppose her. Retreating&#xD;
from before her, he permitted her to proceed, while he&#xD;
turned homeward with a heavy heart.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Priscilla, having got beyond sight and&#xD;
sound, seated herself under a tree, not to rest, bu~t to&#xD;
weep unseen. Here she gave way to a gush of feeling,&#xD;
the more violent because long suppressed. Tears, and&#xD;
even groans, attested her sorrow. Suddenly she check.&#xD;
ed herself.&#xD;
"Foolish and wicked that I am," thought she; " why&#xD;
am I thus disquieted? Surely no new trial has come&#xD;
upon me. What if he, indeed, love me still; what&#xD;
thou ~h report of him and his cousin be untrue; what&#xD;
if I forgive all that is past? it mattereth not.-~'.-my duty&#xD;
remaineth. It can~ not be shunned but by returning&#xD;
evil for good. 'Thy friend and thy father's friend for.&#xD;
get not.' Then how may I, in return for all the kind-&#xD;
ness rendered to me and mine, steal away the hope of&#xD;
their house? No, I will not do it, even though my heart&#xD;
should burst. 'Tis well that I turn on him a cold coun-&#xD;
tenance, even that he thinketh me~ unfeeling and cruel.&#xD;
Be it so."&#xD;
Then, adjusting her cap and hat~-in her agitation,&#xD;
nearly fallen doff-smoothing her hair, and wiping away&#xD;
ihe traces of her tears, she rose, and, slowly proceeding,&#xD;
was so far tranquilized, on reaching home, as to escape&#xD;
question or observation.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
Er~ANou'8 sympathyfor Philip had reconciled her to&#xD;
what she believed could only be a temporary loss of fa-&#xD;
vor; but, when she found she was thereby restricted in&#xD;
her kindly efforts for others, it was harder to bear. Of&#xD;
this she soon had an instance.&#xD;
Pomp had been sent to the ~village on the opposite&#xD;
side of the river, charged with various household er-&#xD;
rands, but, above all, to call for a pair of knee-buckles&#xD;
which Mr. Lawrence had sent to be repaired. lie reb&#xD;
turned just at nightfall, but his memory had proved&#xD;
treacherous, and his master's errand had been forgotten.&#xD;
Finding Eleanor alone in the parlor, he confided to&#xD;
her his trouble, and begged her to "speak a good word&#xD;
for him to massa." She had just given the promise of&#xD;
her best services when her grandfather entered, and the&#xD;
luckless omission had to be confessed.&#xD;
Pomp's fears had not exaggerated the probable conse-&#xD;
quences. Not that Mr. Lawrence cared more for his&#xD;
knee'buckles than an old gentleman should be allowed&#xD;
to do; bnt, ~various similar offenses ott the part of Pomp&#xD;
having of late occurred, and punishment having been.&#xD;
threatened, it was hardly to be expected that he should&#xD;
now escape.&#xD;
"Go instantly hack and get them!" was the penalty&#xD;
denounced.&#xD;
At this' moment it was no small one. The wind had&#xD;
risen7as the night came 'on, and th~ darkness, deepening&#xD;
at every moment, was becoming fearful. Courage was&#xD;
no virtucof Pomp's; add to which, his mother's frequent&#xD;
injunctions to avoid the fate of his father, who had been&#xD;
&#xD;
A P1~EP AT THJ~ ?AST.&#xD;
&#xD;
287&#xD;
&#xD;
drowned, hadi impressed on him a superstitious dread of&#xD;
the water.&#xD;
"Massa," said he, with a quaver in his voice, "de&#xD;
white caps is risin' drefful fast. Won't massa please let&#xD;
me go ober in de morning' ?"&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence had tto sympathy with cowardice in&#xD;
*      any form, and a peremptory negative cut short the en-&#xD;
treaty. Pomp ventured only an imploring glance at&#xD;
Eleanor, which, being observed by his master, she saw&#xD;
only aggravated the matter. Still her promise was not&#xD;
to be broken; and, though hoping little from her inter-&#xD;
ference, she commenced with "Dear grandpapa, do&#xD;
when another command, issued with even more violence,&#xD;
like an explosion, blew poor Pomp 'out of the room.&#xD;
A lull in the wind for a short time furnished an&#xD;
excuse for the harsh mandate; but, as the night ad-&#xD;
vanced, it again rose, justifying all Pomps fears and&#xD;
the prognostics of the kitchen. To the gale was add-&#xD;
ed Egyptian darkness. Eleanor, tQo anxious to sleep,&#xD;
remained up, looking from every wir~dow in hope of&#xD;
some abatement of the storm. At length, recollecting&#xD;
the probable terrors of Pomp's mother, she went to the&#xD;
kitchen, in the wish to afford her such comfort as could&#xD;
if&#xD;
be suggested. She found that her aunt had anticipated.&#xD;
her. The other servants had gone to bed, but poor&#xD;
Minty,. in her desperate grieg had thrown herself before&#xD;
the hearth, and was venting her feelings in tears and&#xD;
moans1 Miss Lawrence bent over her, trying to dispel&#xD;
the fears to which, like a child, she gave way.&#xD;
"Yelly's bery good, missis," at length she sobbed&#xD;
forth, "but je~s so Tom went, missis; jess so! and I&#xD;
neber seed his face agin! I allus thought Pomp would&#xD;
be drowned, 'case he jess like his fader! Oh, missis!&#xD;

wall accompanied these few reproachful words, which&#xD;
her mother's heart could not repress.&#xD;
Miss Lawrence would not reprove what she could not~&#xD;
in trnth, condemn. At length, with some difficulty, in-&#xD;
ducing her to take a composing draught into which she&#xD;
had insinuated an opiate, she and Eleanor got her to bed,&#xD;
and remained with her till it had soothed her to silence&#xD;
and sleep.&#xD;
In returning to her OWli room Eleanor perceiVed the&#xD;
drawing-room door ajar, and a light within. This being&#xD;
unusual at so late an hour, she gently pressed it open,&#xD;
and saw her grandfather standing by the front window,&#xD;
evidently endeavoring to peer into the darkness of the&#xD;
wild night, which was now terrific. Going from window&#xD;
to window, apparently in a vain hope to see what was&#xD;
not to be seen, he then turned round and walked, in an&#xD;
nxious, troubled manner, about the room, looked at his&#xD;
teb, and said to himself, "One o'clock! where can the&#xD;
bo be!"-then again went to the window.&#xD;
willing to leave him alone in this uneasy mood,&#xD;
Elean entered, and, without an offer to bear him com-&#xD;
pany, w ich would of course be rejected, seated herself&#xD;
by a table and took up a book that lay on it. But Mr.&#xD;
Lawrence d not choose to be observed, and, turning&#xD;
*on her abru tly, he said, sharply, "What are you up&#xD;
for? The win disturbed nile; but young folks should&#xD;
not mind such ifies. Go to bed, child; go to bed."&#xD;
"I can not sleep," said Eleanor; "and if you will let&#xD;
me stay with you, sir, I shall not care for the storm.'~&#xD;
"No, no; nonsense I it is no storm. You city people.&#xD;
call every whistle of the wind a storm. Always fright-&#xD;
ened to death about your chimneys and your roofs. My&#xD;
old gables have stood many a worse blast than this. If&#xD;
you will build high, your pride may have a fall. We&#xD;
are safe enough here. Go to bed, go to bed."&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP, AT THE PAs I~.       289&#xD;
&#xD;
His manner admitted of no appeal or hesitation, and&#xD;
she unwillingly obeyed.&#xD;
"Poor grandpapa!" she thought, "he is paying the&#xD;
price of his proud will 1',&#xD;
In the mean time Pomp, having executed his master's&#xD;
command, returned to the ferry, near which a rough&#xD;
shanty afforded a shelter to the ferryman, whose lantern&#xD;
was the only light visible.&#xD;
Pomp entered with fear and trembling.&#xD;
"So, you've come at last," said the gruff voice of Hans&#xD;
Van Slyke, stretching and yawning, and well disposed'&#xD;
to sport with the terrors of his companion. "We may&#xD;
as well be off at once, for we have but narrow quarters&#xD;
herQ. Davy's locker, if ever so wet and cold, will be&#xD;
wider, at any rate; and the white caps will be soft pil-&#xD;

"Lors a marcy, Massa Hans, don't talk dat ar way!&#xD;
Yelly's not afear'd ?"&#xD;
"Afear'd!, who dares say that? But I never crossed&#xD;
in such weather a'fore, I can tell you. I say, Pomp, you&#xD;
didn't think, did you, when you was a catching fish yes.&#xD;
terday, that they'd grab you to-night, eh ?"&#xD;
"Oh, don't! don't! Massa Hans 1"&#xD;
"Why, Pomp," continued th~ immovable Hans, hold-&#xD;
ing his lantern to his face, "you're as white as I am.&#xD;
When they hook you up to-morrow they'll think they've&#xD;
fished a gentleman, and they'll give you a grand funeral.&#xD;
But come, let's be oft;" and, gathering himself up, 'he&#xD;
prepared to face the night, Pomp following with' falter-&#xD;
ing steps. Opening the door, he looked and listened;&#xD;
shook his head, and enlarged on the darkness and dan-&#xD;
ger, but manfully issued forth; when, having played 'out&#xD;
his game, he turned suddenly round, saying, "Pomp, if&#xD;

spite of roaring winds and dashing waters, and, with the&#xD;
early dawn, his cheery whistle was heard at Rosenberg,&#xD;
as he wound round the house, to the comfort of those&#xD;
who were fearing never to hear it again.&#xD;
At breakfast, standing behind his master's chair, he&#xD;
was permitted to relate his experience. The horrors and&#xD;
dangers of the night, of course, were not slighted, nor his&#xD;
own courage in being ready to brave them. Mr. Law-&#xD;
rence, as might be expected, ridiculed all~ but, when&#xD;
Pomp gave his statement of the case as put to Hans, he&#xD;
said, putting some money in his ,hand, "Spoken like a&#xD;
lawyer, Pomp, and there's your fee," better pleased, per-&#xD;
haps, than any one, that no calamity had happened.&#xD;
&#xD;
This was music~to the ears to which it was addressed,&#xD;
but Pomp had now his own game to play.&#xD;
"Not go, Massa Van Slyke! not go! Is dis de way&#xD;
YOU sarve de public? ]I'se agwine on bizens. I don't&#xD;
'q'uire wedder danger here, or danger dere; I make no&#xD;
comparishments, but go whar I sent."&#xD;
"You do, do you? But I ain't a nigger. I'm not&#xD;
going to risk my life for no man. Here I stay," putting&#xD;
down his lantern, closing the door, and shaking up a&#xD;
straw pallet for himself.&#xD;
Pomp's courage growing as the call for it became less,&#xD;
he straightened himself with a characteristic pomposity.&#xD;
"Massa Van Slyke," said he, "I 'spec you know de&#xD;
law. If a man's struttedd in his lawful bizens, ob course&#xD;
dere's damage to pay. Now who's struttedd here? Not&#xD;
you, but me. Who's to pay den? Gb course not me,&#xD;
but you."&#xD;
"Your lawful business," said Hans, scornfully; "I'd&#xD;
like to know what great matter you are trusted with ?"&#xD;
"And I'd hab you know, Massa Hans, dat I'se not&#xD;
gwine to blab. I knows when to speak. and when to&#xD;
hold my tongue. And dis yer's a ting berry near to&#xD;

you tink it of 'portance or not-I know-and I tell you&#xD;
once for all dat you take de whole 'sponsability ob my&#xD;

"Shut up, you black rascal !" exclaimed the regard-&#xD;
less Hans, "and let me go to sleep, will you !"&#xD;
"And whar am I to sleep ?" asked Pomp, with the&#xD;
feeling, of a misused official. "Is dis de only place you&#xD;
perwide for a gen'elman stopped on his lawful bizens ?"&#xD;
"If it's good enough for me, it's good enough for you;&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII&#xD;
A REALLY poetic May had come and nearly gone.&#xD;
The fresh grass, the trees in their young, feathery foliage,&#xD;
the flowers-the first-born of the year-the "charm of&#xD;
'earliest birds," the soft and fragrant air, the mountains&#xD;
in their cerulean blue, and their white, fleecy draperies,&#xD;
the warm sky, flecked with the light clouds which the&#xD;
yet moist earth sent up as incense, "nature all bloom-&#xD;
ing and beneficent," combined to cheer Eleanor, and to&#xD;
charm away the little vexatious that of late had crossed&#xD;
her. She was, indeed, made to&#xD;
"Count her hours&#xD;

But there was one thought she could not always ex-&#xD;
clude, to which the season and its associations gave re-&#xD;
newed strength and freshness, proving that her earnest&#xD;
efforts to conquer it had not been effectual. Eleanor,&#xD;
"A child,&#xD;
Smitten amid its playthings;"&#xD;
one who&#xD;
"Knew not life,&#xD;
Save as the sportive breath of happiness,&#xD;
Now felt her minutes teeming as they rose&#xD;
I,&#xD;
With grave experiences.&#xD;
She had, with a wisdom suddenly and painfully ac-&#xD;
quired, or~ rather, a natural good sense and courage un-&#xD;
expectedly called forth, seen and determined, however&#xD;
'hard, to do her duty. In this she had been aided by a&#xD;
removal to new scenes and new interests, where the gen-&#xD;
tle influence of her aunt had enforced her purpose, and&#xD;
the happiness she conferred had been reflected on her-&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.           293&#xD;
self Without any nice mental analysis, she ~had found&#xD;
that "the best and only way of abstracting the mind&#xD;
from one object was to fix it on another ;" and, in yield-&#xD;
ing herself amiably to those around her, had discovered&#xD;
the best restorative. The first disturbing force had been&#xD;
the unjust displeasure of her grandfather. It had turn-&#xD;
ed the current of her thoughts, which she had sedulous-&#xD;
ly directed to others, back upon herself;' not only by&#xD;
rendering her less happy, but by suggesting comparisons&#xD;
with the standard which she had adopted. Severity, in-&#xD;
justice, weakness, only rendered more conspicuous mild-&#xD;
ness, truth, and strength, embodied in one she could not&#xD;
forget, yet might not love.&#xD;
The day had been unusually warm for the season-&#xD;
even sultry; and, after the early tea, to drive away&#xD;
thought, she snatched up her hat and shawl, and stroll-&#xD;
ed off to her favorite retreat. This was at some distance&#xD;
from th&amp;amp; house, and was gained by a path through a&#xD;
wodd so thick that a stranger, in following it, unexpect-&#xD;
edly Would find himself standing on a little rocky prom-&#xD;
ontory, so shaded and secluded that no habitation was&#xD;
visible, and no sound heard but the' rush of the mill-&#xD;
stream that on one side hurried to the river, and the al-&#xD;
ternating tides that murmured at his feet. A fantastic&#xD;
tree afforded seat and shade; and here, with an agreea-&#xD;
ble book, a pleasanter nook could scarcely have been&#xD;
found.&#xD;
But now, instead of sitting or reading, Eleanor leaned&#xD;
on a projection of the rock that rose like a battlement&#xD;
before her andf 'bending osrer it, thought of honie~ La-&#xD;
ther, mother, and.-Walter; of her dear study; of the&#xD;
lessons first~ disliked and then loved; of absence&#xD;

the greater power because so long repressed, and tears,&#xD;
unbidden and unthought of; fell on the hand which sup-~&#xD;

WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
ported her cheek. She saw nothing-not river; nor&#xD;
mountain, nor setting sun; nor a sioop, whose idle sails&#xD;
were flapping in the lazy air; nor yet another, which,&#xD;
at low tide, was stranded on a bar near the opposite&#xD;
shore. No, nor a little boat, which, having put off from&#xD;
its side, had, after a few moments, changed its oblique&#xD;
course, and was steering toward the spot she occupied.&#xD;
Neither did she see that a spyglass, handed from one to&#xD;
another, was directed to herself; nor; until the boat's&#xD;
prow disturbed the monotonous murmur on the beach,&#xD;
was she roused to see that a young man, returning the&#xD;
glass to some One near him, had leaped ashore, at the&#xD;
same moment answering the question, "At what hour&#xD;
sir?" b~ another-&#xD;
"When does the tide serve&#xD;
"At nine o'clock."&#xD;
"Very well; you'll find me here."&#xD;
That voice awoke an echo in her heart. Starting from&#xD;
her reverie, she saw, struggling up the rock, and in a&#xD;
few seconds by ~her side, with glowing, animated face&#xD;
and extended hand, the very spirit of her waking&#xD;
dream.&#xD;
"Mr. Thorniey I" she exclaimed.&#xD;
"Eleanor !" he replied, excited out of his habitual cau-&#xD;
tious address. Their hands met; their "mutual eyes"&#xD;
were elopient, but tb~eir words were few. Their last&#xD;
sad parting was present to them.&#xD;
"Do not stand," said Walter, first recovering hiruseiC&#xD;
"Rest here, where the Dryads seem to have prepared a&#xD;
seat for you"-~--leading :her to the old tree, whose dis-&#xD;
torted trunk afforded a resting-place-" and I will find a&#xD;
fitting one here," throwing himself on the grass at her&#xD;
feet.-&#xD;
Eleanor, in a bewilderment of joy and surprise, cordd&#xD;
~ay ~nothing. ~he passively complied with his sugges-&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
tion, while he sat gazing into her face, to which the year&#xD;
since they had' parted had added both strength and&#xD;
beauty. The freedom, the pure~dr; t e healthftil exer-&#xD;
cise, the early hours of her \~uiet, i artificial country&#xD;
life, had increased her bloom, and m ured her figure to&#xD;
its Ml and perfect proportions. She had ceased to be&#xD;
a child without losing a single grace of childhood. She&#xD;
had grown into the dignity of a woman without any con-&#xD;
sciousness of greater importance.&#xD;
"Nov, tell me," said she, at length, "where have you&#xD;
come from? the earth beneath, or the sky above? for I&#xD;
have not th~ faintest idea."&#xD;
"My progress has been neither subterranean nor ethe-&#xD;
real-entirely prosaic, and like that of other mortals.&#xD;
But, in order to be understood, I must enter into particu-&#xD;
lars. You, perhaps, remember my legal aspirations, and&#xD;
the facilities afforded by your father. Well, I have&#xD;
obeyed the impulse thus encouraged, and am in the out-&#xD;
er court of the temple I so much desire to enter-a law-&#xD;
yer's clerk; with so much of his confidence that I am&#xD;
now absent on his business. Is not that well ?"&#xD;
"That sounds well, at least," said Eleanor; returning&#xD;
his smile, "but do you like it? Now, for once, descend&#xD;
to my level, and admit that a thing may be very wise,&#xD;
and yet very disagreeable. Those dry books, those in-&#xD;
terminable papers, are they not horridly tiresome?"&#xD;
"Tiresome! have a care lest I send you back to the&#xD;
study, and, putting on my schoolmaster's frown, tell you,&#xD;
in the words of your old friend Plutarch, that 'Law is&#xD;
the king of mortals and immortals-of nature, nan,&#xD;
angels, and even the highest intelligences' that 'law&#xD;
Is-&#xD;
"Oh, no more! I'll believe all, any thing; only speak&#xD;
yourself; and let Plutarch be silent."&#xD;
"Well, then, having awed you into a proper state of&#xD;

mind, I will admit that, as yet, I do not find it very ex-&#xD;
citing; nevertheless, it is occupation for the present, hope&#xD;
for the future. Hope! hope !" added he, with animation,&#xD;
"that mysterious essence of life! about which physiolo-&#xD;
gists dispute. But- to explain why I am here. My bus~&#xD;
incas took i~ie to Albany-; where, having failed to obtain&#xD;
the desired information, I am now seeking it in New York.&#xD;
We grounded on the Overslaugh, and again here on the&#xD;
opposite bar. A boat was to be sent ashore for a- fresh&#xD;
supply of milk and bread; and, to beguile the time, I&#xD;
-jumped in. Your little promontory caught my eye,&#xD;
with a figure like Hope resting on her anchor, and, with&#xD;
eyes directed to the distant main, inviting the wandering&#xD;
sailor home. An instinct that could not fail told me it&#xD;
was you. I seized a glass to assure myself; and found I&#xD;
was not deceived. Now tell me, in return, of yourself.&#xD;
Where are you? and why? and how does that busy&#xD;
young mind occupy itself?"&#xD;
Eleanor gave a brief sketch of her visit. She longed&#xD;
to tell every thing, but she reflected that Philip's inter~&#xD;
eats, and her -grandfather's infirmities might not be re-&#xD;
vealed to a stranger. On her aunt she could fearlessly&#xD;
dilate; and the more earnestly from the pleasure with&#xD;
whlQh- Walter -listened, as he perceived how- much so&#xD;
lovely- a character had touched her.&#xD;
"And society?" he asked; "are there no Oscars to&#xD;
bewitch? no hearts to bless or-to break ?"&#xD;
"Oh dear, no! The only one I might have been&#xD;
tempted to experiment upon is pre-engaged, so I have&#xD;
had: no Qpportunity of losing my own, nor of winning&#xD;
another's~"&#xD;
To this succeeded inquiries as to reading, study, and&#xD;
so on-all put very properly, and answered categorically,&#xD;
but with that "double consciousness"-.wI~ien the lips&#xD;
speak of what tihe heart is not thinking-which those&#xD;
will readily understand who have been similarly affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEE!? AT THE PAST. -          ~97&#xD;
&#xD;
And now, as Walter reclines at her feet, with eyes up-&#xD;
raised, that seem to say&#xD;
"How like a winter hath my absence been&#xD;
Prom thee !"&#xD;
it is well if every resokaioa be not forgotten~ It is well&#xD;
if she do not&#xD;
"flead what silent love hath writ."&#xD;
Beware, Walter! You have been wise, you have been&#xD;
strong. But you have now, in a fond self-reliance, ven-&#xD;
tured into temptation. Ah! you are beginning to know&#xD;
it yourself~ Your - heart nearly bursts the restraints&#xD;
you have imposed on - it, as you read in those sweet&#xD;
eyes innocently bent down on you, in those kind&#xD;
smiles7 whose light shines into your very soul, the&#xD;
answer you m~qht find! But no, you are still master&#xD;
of yourself.&#xD;
How long he would have remained so is not to be told.&#xD;
Ah! how often is human wisdom the result of some&#xD;
beneficent arrangement for us; or some lucky accident,&#xD;
as we falsely and unbelievingly term it! -&#xD;
At this moment a rumble of distant thunder recalled&#xD;
them from the inner to the outer world; .and they per.~&#xD;
ceived, for the first time, that, while they had been sport-&#xD;
ing in - rainbows, the night had gathered blackness.&#xD;
Heavy clouds were rolling toward them; the sultry air -&#xD;
was stirred by a wind, the forerunner of a gust; lightnings&#xD;
flashed along the horizon, attended at shorter intervals&#xD;
by thunder nearer and louder, and every thing indicated.&#xD;
an approaching storm..&#xD;
Eleanor started from her seat, wrapping her shawl&#xD;
around her, and Walter, alarmed at so -slight a protec-&#xD;
tion, entreated her to lose no time in returning.&#xD;
"And you?" said she; "what is to shelter you?"&#xD;
* "Oh, this thick wood would be sufficient, so well&#xD;
used as I am 'to such expo~ures; but I shall go with ~-ou,~&#xD;

&#xD;
WALTER ~rnoRNLEY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
and shall still be in time to keep my appointment with&#xD;
the boat."&#xD;
There was no time for farther parley, and they turned&#xD;
homeward.&#xD;
Luvkily, though threatening every instant, the rain&#xD;
did not actually fall; but the darkness increased fear-&#xD;
fully, and the' lightning, more and more vivid and fre-&#xD;
quent, was their only guide. The long, deep wood,&#xD;
through which they must pass by merely a narrow foot-&#xD;
path, often obstructed by fallen brushwood, and which,&#xD;
in the.cheerful day, was, only wild and romantic, now be-&#xD;
came intense in gloom; and almost a place of danger.&#xD;
At' every moment Eleanor feared to strike her head&#xD;
against 'a tree, or to be prostrated by some unseen ob-&#xD;
stacle. Walter's anxiety for her gave importance to&#xD;
what, if alone, he would have disregarded. In moment-&#xD;
ary ex~eetation' of a pelting rain, he would, had the path&#xD;
permitted, with merely an arm around her, have borne&#xD;
her along scarce aided by herself; but this was here im-&#xD;
possible.&#xD;
While' thus groping their way, Walter preceding and&#xD;
leading her by the hand, they both, at the same time, ex-&#xD;
claimed, "What is that? Hark! Who is there ?~'&#xD;
They stopped and listened.&#xD;
'"'Tis nothing," said Walter; "nothing but the rustle&#xD;
of the leaves under our feet."&#xD;
"Do yon think'so? It sounded exactly like a foot-&#xD;
step. 'There!  Phere it is again 1"&#xD;
"'Tis only the echo of our own. Do not be alarmed;&#xD;
there can be no cause; for, even if it be a footstep, 'tis&#xD;
only some unlucky wanderer like ourselves. Do not&#xD;
~think of it. ' Haste, hast6, Eleanor! I feel the rain this&#xD;
moment."&#xD;
But, though Waiter endeavored to divert her appre-&#xD;
hension; ~he often looked round into the darkness,'which&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
299.&#xD;
&#xD;
his eye could not penetrate, and oniy spoke to urge her&#xD;
onward.&#xD;
At length they emerged from the wood, and crossed&#xD;
an open space, under a dim light, by which an object&#xD;
might have been discerned.' It was, however, only to&#xD;
enter another scarce less impervious, through which an&#xD;
avenue led to the house. Here, proceeding with less&#xD;
difficulty, and with a feeling of security, Eleanor revert-&#xD;
ed to the sounds that had disturbed her.&#xD;
"Why," she asked, "should no answer be returned?&#xD;
One would think that, at such a time, mere companion-&#xD;
ship would be a motive to speaks"&#xD;
"Recollect, Eleanor) it is only your assumption that&#xD;
there was a person. In such a confusion of sounds, one&#xD;
is easily mistaken. But think no more of it. Have we&#xD;
yet far to go?"&#xD;
"No, not far; that is, measuring distance by my steps,&#xD;
for I see nothing. Ah! there's 'a light! Yes, w&amp;amp; are&#xD;
approaching the house at the front. The parlor windows&#xD;
are behind; we can not see them here. Now you must&#xD;
leave me."&#xD;
"Leave you! here, unsheltered, alone! Never."&#xD;
* "Nay, I know best," said I~lleanor, fearful of the ef-&#xD;
fect of his entrance on her grandfather. "I am within&#xD;
a few paces of the house; there is nothing to fear for&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"But let me see ~you within the door at least."&#xD;
"I San not, I must not: let me judge."&#xD;
Constrained by her earnestness-as no real danger&#xD;
could be apprehended-he yielded; but said, with an&#xD;
emotion that, fortunately for both, could not be per-&#xD;
ceived, "You drive me from you, Eleanor, and' I go.&#xD;
What else, indeed, can I do ?" Then, with an attempt&#xD;
at cheerfulness, he added, "But, in like manner as we&#xD;
have now met, we may meet agaiff. To insure this, were&#xD;

i~ a heathen, I would erect an, altar. to the goddess of the&#xD;
'Unforeseen I'". and raising. to his lips the hand he still&#xD;
held, "Farewell, Eleanor 1" he said, and was gone, while&#xD;
her half.uttered parting words were unheard.&#xD;
Approaching, as she supposed, the front door, which,&#xD;
however, she did not wish to enter, she passed farther&#xD;
on; but the rain, so long~ threatened, now came with a&#xD;
violence that, added to the darkness, perplexed her.&#xD;
She turned a corner, where a. gust met and nearly pros-&#xD;
trated her; and, struggling with it, she became bewil-&#xD;
deredas to the direction she was taking. Dimly dis-&#xD;
cerning the mass of building, and seeking a private en-&#xD;
trance somewhere, in order to avoid embarrassing ques-&#xD;
tions, she was pressing on, uncertain if right or wrong,&#xD;
when~ the sounds that had lately disturbed her fell on&#xD;
her ear again, and so close as to startle her. At the&#xD;
same instant a flash of lightning,' broad and vivid, re-&#xD;
vealed a dark figure within a few feet of her. It was&#xD;
tall, but. so wrapped that only a general outline was&#xD;
seen, relieved against a glass window, from which was&#xD;
reflected a strong light. The next moment all was total&#xD;
darkness.&#xD;
"The dood-lcctmer I" she exclaimed, "what fate has&#xD;
brought. me here~?" and, her imagination excited by the&#xD;
vague terrors she associated with that part of the house,&#xD;
and, in an agony offer, attempting to escape the phan-&#xD;
torn at her side, she darted forward, her foot slipped, she&#xD;
fell, and her senses fled.&#xD;
She was roused, by a wailing voice and a lantern&#xD;
flashing in her face, to find her faithful Phyllis, who&#xD;
had been in quest of her, bending over her. The vio-&#xD;
lence of. the rain had ceased; but, thoroughly wetted&#xD;
and chilled, she readily comprehended the necessity&#xD;
urged by Phyllis, of getting, into the house as soon&#xD;
as possible. Covering her mistress with ~he el6a~k ~she&#xD;
&#xD;
had provided, and supporting her trembling limbs with&#xD;
an arm strongly clasped around her, she guided her,&#xD;
as Eleanor requested, to the steps leading to the af-&#xD;
dak, by which, through the porlaal, she might gain her&#xD;
own room unobserved. Having reached it, and guard-&#xD;
ing against ~ny alarm, by directing that her aunt should&#xD;
be merely told that she had come home tired, and re-&#xD;
quested not to be disturbed, she resigned herself to&#xD;
the care of Phyllis, who laid her, like an unresisting&#xD;
child, on her bed. The energies and affections of the&#xD;
little maid were all alive. She flew out of the room,&#xD;
was back again like a flash; held a glass of. wine to her&#xD;
lips, which Eleanor could not refuse; felt her feet&#xD;
found them cold; rushed out, and in again with a bottle&#xD;
of hot water for them; tucked every thing about her,&#xD;
and then seated herself in a corner to be ready if any&#xD;
thing more were wanted.&#xD;
The next morning, however, the fact could not be&#xD;
concealed. A restless night, during which Phyllis had&#xD;
never left her, was succeeded by all the indications of a&#xD;
violent cold, confining her not only to her room but to&#xD;
the bed. Her aunt attended her with anxious affection.&#xD;
But Mr. Lawrence, though putting aside his air of offend-&#xD;
ed majesty, and unable to disguise his interest, would&#xD;
not admit that she was ill. "It was a bad cold-noth-&#xD;
ing more; she would be well directly." At the request&#xD;
of Miss Lawrence the doctor came: "SaW no danger at&#xD;
present; but, if fever and delirium should supervene,&#xD;
couldn't say," only shook his head ominously. These&#xD;
suggestions enraged Mr. Lawrence, who, resolved she&#xD;
should not be ill, was only more persistent in his first&#xD;
opinion; would not allow her parents to be sent for;&#xD;
would not permit her aunt to remain with her at night,&#xD;
bnt commanded Flore to do so.&#xD;
Thus passed two 'days and nights.' A~ was f~ar~d, de-&#xD;

302,         WALTER ~rHORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
lirium and fever did appear, but Mr. Lawence changed&#xD;
not. The third morning a bulletin announced to him&#xD;
a better night, no fever, soft skin, cough abated, head&#xD;
clear. "I told you so I" said he, triumphantly, and his&#xD;
imperious will found still another. confirmation.&#xD;
As her indisposition yielded, Eleanor's mind recurred&#xD;
to the circumstances immediately preceding. "That si-&#xD;
lent figure! seen so distinctly, though but for a moment.&#xD;
That strange light on the window of that fearful cham-&#xD;
ber! Was it indeed a reflection from without? Did it&#xD;
not c6me from within? And, if so, what might it not&#xD;
portend? Why had she been led to that place she so&#xD;
sedulously shunned? Why had she fallen near its fa-&#xD;
tal door, to which that dark phantom appeared to con-&#xD;
duct her? Might not some fatality impending over her&#xD;
involve Walter also ?"&#xD;
Again and again she asked~ these questions, and as&#xD;
often her reason suggested plausible, but not satisfactory&#xD;
explanations. "A man-servant might have been re-&#xD;
turning Iaome.-he would be silent, of course; why not?&#xD;
A reflection of the lightning from the gla~s was an easy&#xD;
solution of the strange light! Why, in the dark, might&#xD;
she not miss her way ? and, being terrified and faint,&#xD;
why should she not fall ?"&#xD;
* Let not poor Eleanor be condemned for superstitious&#xD;
terrors in her time not 'uncommon; especially not by&#xD;
those of the nineteenth century, of whom some believe&#xD;
-nothing, and others-every thing.&#xD;
Eleanor was passing the twilight-hour alone with these&#xD;
reflections, to which was now added the question of&#xD;
"How would grandpapa receive her when she should&#xD;
rejoin the family ?" whenAunt Flore asked permission&#xD;
to enter.&#xD;
* "All alone, missis ?" said she; "in de dark too! Well,&#xD;
I drefful grad yefly's 'gwine down stars to-morrow. I&#xD;

Flore had been so devoted to her, that Eleau~r was&#xD;
pleased to have a favor to grant her.&#xD;
"Well den, missis, sarbents hab'n't no bizens to 'quire&#xD;

"Every thing !" repeated Eleanor, alarmed; "what&#xD;
did I say, Aunt Flore ?"&#xD;
"Oh, letting particular, 'cept ole massa, and de dood-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
Miss LAWRENCE had perceived in Eleanor a flutter&#xD;
of spirits, an unequal. manner, an occasional anxiety and&#xD;
abstraction, so unlike herself as to excite, not only ob-&#xD;
servation, bu~ solicitude. It was, therefore, with as much&#xD;
pleasure as surprise that, as they sat together in the pam&#xD;
br the day after Eleanor's return to it, she saw her, on&#xD;
Pomp's ushering in a gentleman, dart forward to ~meet&#xD;
him, exclaiming, with much animation, "Captain Tal-&#xD;
bot! how glad I am to see you."&#xD;
The sentiment was more than responded to; so much&#xD;
so that Eleanor was not sorry to check his almost rap-&#xD;
turous delight by an introduction tQ her aunt, of whose&#xD;
presence he had seemed unconscious.&#xD;
The captain was not a man to let his feelings run&#xD;
away with him; but Eleanor's excitement at seeinghim,&#xD;
her improved beauty, and her more-confirmed manner,&#xD;
bringing with it the hope of a better capacity to esti-&#xD;
mate himself, threw him off his guard. Soon recover-&#xD;
ing, however, with his usual presence of mind, he ad-&#xD;
dressed himself to Miss Lawrence. Of course, there were&#xD;
many inquiries on the part of Eleanor to answer. Hav-&#xD;
ing satisfied these, he next ventured to hope that she&#xD;
might care to hear something of himself; and proceeded&#xD;
to say that "he had only lately arrived frorri England;&#xD;
that he was now on a visit to their neighbor, Mr. Johnson;&#xD;
and, finding that he was near KRosenberg, he had taken'&#xD;
the liberty to call on his young friend, Miss Eleanor, and&#xD;
also to inquire after the health of Mr. Lawrence, of whom&#xD;
he had heard so much as to inspire him with a profound&#xD;
respect."&#xD;

&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence, being informed of the attention design-&#xD;
ed for huin, made his appearance. The captain was gra-&#xD;
ciously received; and, having produced an agreeable im-&#xD;
pression, took his leave, with an invitation to dinner the&#xD;
following day.&#xD;
Even before the appointed hour, though an early one,&#xD;
Captain Talbot rode up the avenue. Philip had just re-&#xD;
turned from a morning in the woods, and, having sent&#xD;
Pomp in with his sporting equipment, and his game.&#xD;
bag to Aunt Minty, he loitered near the entrance to see&#xD;
who this stranger might be. The captain alighted from&#xD;
his horse; and, deceived by the "questionable shape" in&#xD;
which Master Philip appeared, disguised in his careless&#xD;
sportsman's dress, threw the bridle toward him, saying,&#xD;
"He is warm-see him well cared for," walked, with a&#xD;
superior air, into the house. Though willing to believe&#xD;
it a mistake, Phil was piqued; and, after making his&#xD;
toilet with more than usual attention, descended to the&#xD;
drawing-room, fully intending to overwhelm their un-&#xD;
discriminating guest with deserved confusion.&#xD;
Meanwhile the captain was invited to the guest-cham-&#xD;
ber to relieve himself of the effects of a dusty ride. Ele-&#xD;
anor, not aware of his arrival, left her room in order to&#xD;
be ready to receive him when he should come; but, in&#xD;
passing through the upper entry, she caught a glimpse&#xD;
of a gentleman in the "picture hall," as it was called-&#xD;
into which the room allotted to visitors opened. This&#xD;
hall was cut off from the entry by a glass door, now&#xD;
ajar, through which she could see and hear, herself be-&#xD;
ing screened by a projection of the wall.&#xD;
"Captain Talbot !" thought she "here so soon! and,&#xD;
as I live, standing before the forbidden picture, unveil-&#xD;
~d! He alone has dared to expose it!"&#xD;
,~ She drew a little nearer-the desire to see the face so&#xD;
l~ng denied was irresistible--nearer still. "Yes; now.&#xD;
&#xD;
I see it! It is not at all like Cousin Phil, though," con-&#xD;
tinued she, disappointed. "Can it indeed be his father?&#xD;
What an intellectual forehead! Eyes full of thought&#xD;
and feeling! What sweetness in the mouth! 'Tis a&#xD;
shame to hide such a face !-hist, the captain is speak-&#xD;
ing!"&#xD;
"'Tis very strange," said he, unaware of any one near&#xD;
him, "very strange !" as, varying his position, looking&#xD;
now in front, now obliquely, now closer, then farther off;&#xD;
he tried to catch the face under' different aspects. "If&#xD;
not the man, certainly a marvelous resemblance! but, if&#xD;
he in fact, how should it be here? Stranger still this&#xD;
fantastic device to conceal it. And why ?"&#xD;
At this moment a door opened, and Momma Zip&#xD;
crossed the hail. He beckoned to her and addressed a&#xD;
few words to her, which not' understanding,.. she remain-&#xD;
ed silent. Inferring from this that if there were a secret&#xD;
it was to be obtained only in one way, he put' a piece'&#xD;
of money into her hand. Dropping a courtesy, she re-&#xD;
ceived it apparently with proper gratitude, but was still&#xD;
silent;' upon which, concluding her to be dull of appre-&#xD;
hension, he enforced his inquiry by signs, and, pointing&#xD;
to the picture, said, with emphasis, "Who is tlwtt-tlt at,&#xD;
Isay? Speak!"&#xD;
Zip shook her head, but not to express ignorance.&#xD;
On the contrary, taking the money from her pocket, she&#xD;
placed it on a table near which they were standing with&#xD;
a force that gave the effect of rejection; and walked off&#xD;
with an air that said, "I know, but I am n'oL to be'&#xD;
bribed."&#xD;
The captain, for a moment, was confounded'. The key&#xD;
which he had found a passe-partout had failed. There&#xD;
were in the heart of a poor old negress wards that it&#xD;
would not fit.&#xD;
"Why! what an African Princess !" he exclaimed.&#xD;

&#xD;
But this only increased the wonder. "It must be ex-&#xD;
plained."&#xD;
Eleanor, having the clue, was amused, and still more&#xD;
charmed, with Momma's fidelity. Hurrying away, lest&#xD;
she might encounter him, she entered the drawing-room,&#xD;
where Master Philip, in fulbbl9wn dress and offended&#xD;
dignity, awaited the moment when he should enjoy the&#xD;
captain's embarrassment. This, however, was not to be.&#xD;
Theaptain did not perceive his mistake; or~ rather, was&#xD;
too much a man of the world to give it importance by&#xD;
referring to it.&#xD;
The dinner passed off well. Though not loving the&#xD;
English any too much, Mr. Lawrence understood the&#xD;
duties of a' host; besides which the captain was full of&#xD;
information on all subjects, and it was a rare chance to&#xD;
catch such a visitor in the country.&#xD;
Recommending himself by social anecdote and amus-&#xD;
ing details of city life, he contrived, notwithstanding&#xD;
that the gentle gravity of Miss Lawrence occasionally&#xD;
rebuked a caustic sally, the wit of which did not to her&#xD;
atone for the insinuation it conveyed, to make himself&#xD;
acceptable to the ladies. Master Philip, though rather&#xD;
in a bad humor, was considerably mollified. As to Ele-&#xD;
anor, she was actually gay; and the captain, who could&#xD;
~not understand that it was a nervous reaction-the nat-&#xD;
u~al consequence of the depressing influences under&#xD;
which she had recently suffered--saw it only as the&#xD;
effect of his presence, and a daring hope again possess-&#xD;
ed him.&#xD;
In the evening other visitors joined them. Whist&#xD;
was introduced; and here the captain, as in every thing,&#xD;
was au fait; and Mr. Lawrence, animated by finding&#xD;
a competitor worthy of his "best play," acquiesced&#xD;
reluctantly, when he politely resigned his seat to an-&#xD;
other. Having done s6, he joined Philip in a corner, at&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEk' AT THE PAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
309&#xD;
&#xD;
a distance from others; and Eleanor heard him, in a gen-&#xD;
tle under-voice, refer to the mystery of the picture, and&#xD;
inquire the name of the original; to which Phil replied,&#xD;
coldly,&#xD;
"'Tis a family matter, sir, of which we do not speak."&#xD;
"I beg pardon," said the unabashed captain; "I ought&#xD;
to have understood as much, from the very circumstance&#xD;
that provoked my inquiry. Excuse me." And he took&#xD;
a seat by the side of Eleanor. In a little time, letting&#xD;
fall, rather abruptly, the thread of conversation he had&#xD;
been pursuing, he said, in a low, conI~idential tone, "Have&#xD;
you a haunted chamber in this house ?"&#xD;
Eleanor turned pale. All her terrors of a certain&#xD;
room, all her late strange sick fancies returned, and she&#xD;
faltered out, "No! no! What-how came you to think&#xD;
of such a thing ?"&#xD;
'His penetrating eye rested on her face an instant.&#xD;
He then carelessly added, "Because one mystery is apt&#xD;
to suggest others.. Who is the original of that veiled&#xD;
picture? Was he not a hero of some romance of real&#xD;
life, in true novel style treacherously murdered? and&#xD;
does not his spirit walk this labyrinthine dwelling?"&#xD;
"Oh, horrible !" exclaimed Eleanor, with a shudder,&#xD;
she thought of the tragical fate of her uncle.&#xD;
"But tell me, who was 'he ?"&#xD;
confess I am as curious as a woman; be-&#xD;
Surprised, and rather amused at his persistency, she&#xD;
"I thought that ladies only were accused of cu-&#xD;
sides, 'tis a traveler's privilege to ask questions. Why&#xD;
else should he travel at all? Well'; and his name&#xD;
2 was-"&#xD;
Eleanor put her finger to her lip.&#xD;
"IDo you know?"&#xD;
The same sign repeated.&#xD;

"Will you answer,~if I guess ?"'&#xD;
She shook' her head.&#xD;
"One of the family ?"&#xD;
The finger to the lip again.&#xD;
"What a nice little Trappiste you would make 1',&#xD;
"And what a poor inquisitor would you he 1" said&#xD;
she, laughing.&#xD;
"I am merciful; I have not yet applied the torture."&#xD;
"The torture !"&#xD;
"Ay; I could do so," said he, with a look quite in-&#xD;
comprehensible. Then, as if to remove the impression&#xD;
he had made, "Don't you deserve to be tortured; you,&#xD;
who inflict torture on others ?"&#xD;
"What a strange man 1" she thought. "lie abso-&#xD;
lutely frightens me sometimes."&#xD;
The whist-players having finished their rubber, music&#xD;
was called for. Eleanor, glad to escape, rose to obey;&#xD;
and, seating herself at the spinet, summoned Cousin Phil&#xD;
to her assistance. They sang together with much ap-&#xD;
proval-the captain's eye more intent than his ear-~anJ&#xD;
were leaving the instrument, when Eleanor' stopped, r8e-&#xD;
~umed the seat, and, looking' up into Philip's face with&#xD;
a mischievous 'expression, sang, from the "Gentle Shep-&#xD;
herd,"&#xD;
"The lass of ratio's Mill,&#xD;
So bonny, blithe, and gay,&#xD;
Hath won my right good will,&#xD;
Ilath stawn my heart away 1"&#xD;
The looks of intelligence exchanged by herself and&#xD;
Philip, and the consciousness of the latter, showed an un-&#xD;
derstanding not ~agreeable to the captain. But supper~&#xD;
was announced, and song and sentiment ceased.&#xD;
The next day brought the captain again, who, assidu-&#xD;
ous to please Mr. Lawrence, by a ready instinct adapted&#xD;
himself to his tastes-admired the country, Rosenberg&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
311&#xD;
&#xD;
especially~-even the quaint architecture of the old Dutch&#xD;
house, rural life, and manners; wondered not that lie&#xD;
had abjured. the city, etc.&#xD;
Presently, Pomp entered, to say that "Hans Van&#xD;
Slyke come to speak to massa."&#xD;
lEans was admitted. The amount of his communica-&#xD;
tion was that "He had seen two men slyly ascending&#xD;
the hill, in the direction of the garden; that, on his hal-&#xD;
looing to them, they had fled, and he had lost sight of&#xD;
them; but that, soon after, a boat had pushed oW and&#xD;
that they must have returned in it to a sloop lying just&#xD;
off 'the point;' that, as she might be there some hours,&#xD;
he thought Mr:Lawrence ought to know."&#xD;
Now Mr. Lawrence's fruit was almost as dear to him&#xD;
as his honor. Indeed, it might be said to make part of&#xD;
it, inasmuch as it was his pride to produce the finest in&#xD;
the county. In consequence of its exposed situation,&#xD;
and within only 'a low stone fence that a boy could leap,&#xD;
he had often suffered from such river marauders. He&#xD;
had set on his dogs, and had talked loudly of doing&#xD;
worse; but, as no one believed he would ever enforce&#xD;
his threats, they became a dead letter, much to the com-&#xD;
fort of Miss Lawrence, on whose disinclination to strong&#xD;
measures-though not, in fact, greater than his own-&#xD;
lie always threw the blame. 'K'A little gunpowder," he&#xD;
said, "would soon settle it ;" but Gitty wouldn't hear&#xD;
of it, and so he must submit, as he always did.&#xD;
"The rascals I" 'he exclaimed, as Hans concluded;&#xD;
"they were after my 'early Annes' Here, Pomp, do&#xD;
you be on the watch, and if you see any thing more of&#xD;
them call out the dogs."&#xD;
And here the matter would probably have rested but&#xD;
for an observation of the captain.&#xD;
"Ali! my dear sir," said he~ "we manage this business&#xD;
better. Brick walls, spring guns, and man-traps are the&#xD;

only protection. But," with a shrug, "free people, free&#xD;
game, and free fruit, of course."&#xD;
Rather nettled by the superior air with which this&#xD;
was said, Mr. Lawrence was about to reply, when Hans,&#xD;
enraged~ against the supposed thieves, whom, like a true&#xD;
Dutchman, he pronounced to be "Yankees," and en-&#xD;
couraged by the remark of the captain, went on to say&#xD;
that "They got worse and worser. That it was not&#xD;
mu~~h over a week since a boat set a man ashore, just&#xD;
under the hill, and left him to get the fruit against they&#xD;
came back-that they did so, late in the evening---that&#xD;
he heard their voices and their oars.&#xD;
"My May Dukes 1" exclaimed Mr. Lawrence, "the&#xD;
scoundrels were after them, too, and have broken my&#xD;
trees besides." Thoroughly roused, first by the implied&#xD;
waj of law and order in the new republic- 0 tempora,&#xD;
0 n wes,~what might be said now! - and then by vis-&#xD;
ions of mangled cherry-trees, he called on his henchman,&#xD;
Pomp.&#xD;
"Has any mischief been done to the trees ?"&#xD;
"No, massa, b'liebe not. Dere was a boat com'd here&#xD;
t'oder night from a skipper out in the riber, jess as Hans&#xD;
say. It com'd afore dark, and den agin when de tide&#xD;
was up. But lors, massa! dat ar was de night storm'd&#xD;
so; so dark neber couldn't. pick nottin'. Same night&#xD;
young missis was cotch'd out. Young missis"-turning&#xD;
to Eleano~-~"'members dat ar, and p'r'aps she seed de&#xD;
boat too."&#xD;
This personal application did not diminish the. uncom-&#xD;
fortable conscjousness under which Eleanor had been&#xD;
growing hot and cold ever since the discussion began.&#xD;
She did not accuse herself for an accidental meeting with&#xD;
Walter, but the circumstances, she was aware, might ex-&#xD;
cite suspicions undeserved both by him and herself. In&#xD;
extremity one, thinks rapidly. This was no time to de-&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
313&#xD;
&#xD;
cide if she had acted wisely or not. She was, at least,&#xD;
confident of her right intention, and she must abide by&#xD;
what she had done. If concealment at first were proper,&#xD;
it was certainly still mor.e so in the presence of Captain&#xD;
Talbot. With her usual directness, therefore, she stated&#xD;
the simple fact for which she was referred to-the COrn-&#xD;
ing of a boat; and, amused in spite of her secret disqui-&#xD;
etude at the design imputed to Walter, she added, with&#xD;
a smile, "I rather think, however, grandpapa, that your&#xD;
May Dukes are safe.". But he was no~ now in a mood&#xD;
to be~ easily satisfied.&#xD;
"Safe 1" he exclaimed, angrily. "Yes, till the next&#xD;
sloop stops within reach of them. There is but one&#xD;
way," continued he, with a look at poor Miss Gertrude&#xD;
as reproachful as if she were an accomplice; "but one&#xD;
way;" and down came the cane in confirmation. "Pomp,&#xD;
tell master Philip to leave a loaded gun-a loaded gun,&#xD;
you understand-in the af-dak. I'll see if I can't, for&#xD;
once in my life, do as I please :" another look at Miss&#xD;
Lawrence. "But, Pomp, do you hear? don't you dare,&#xD;
you puppy, to meddle with it. If you must be shot, I'll&#xD;
do it myself properly, I'll have none of your blunder-&#xD;
ing work."&#xD;
"Yes, massa," replied Pomp, with a grin.; and vanish-&#xD;
ed, greatly magnified iii his own eyes by a commission&#xD;
of such importance.&#xD;
"Massa gib it to 'em!" exclaimed he, as he started off&#xD;
on a skip and a jump. "Neber nobody like ole massa&#xD;

WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
CAPTAIN TALBOT, availing himself of a general invita-'&#xD;
tion, was now a daily visitor. Mr. Johnson lived~ with-&#xD;
in walking distance; and, either on foot or on horseback&#xD;
morning or evening, he was sure to make his appear-&#xD;
ance. For a time this passed smoothly. Mis~ Lawrence&#xD;
was amused, her father entertained, and Eleanor more&#xD;
excited and interested than by any thing else-a fact&#xD;
which her aunt innocently revealed by greeting him on&#xD;
one occasion with the welcome words, "I am glad you've&#xD;
come, Captain Talbot. You wilFput Eleanor in spirits,&#xD;
I hope. She has been so dull to-day! No one but you&#xD;
can animate her."&#xD;
Eyen Philip had given in his adhesion: but the lik-&#xD;
ing, somehow, did not ripen into cordiality; so far from&#xD;
it that Miss Lawrence, though polite as ever, grew tired&#xD;
of being always amused; Mr. Lawrence became suspi-&#xD;
cious of the captains views; and Master Philip resent-&#xD;
ed the eagle glance that seemed to watch every whisper&#xD;
or look that might chance between him and his cousin.&#xD;
She alone remained as usual, and this was enough for&#xD;
the captain. His manner to hei~-always that of a kind&#xD;
friend, interested in her health, her pursuits, her improve-&#xD;
ment-.---.with whom she had a larger range of subjects than&#xD;
with Cousin Phil, and who, consequently, could better&#xD;
withdraw her from unpleasant thoughts when such would&#xD;
intrude-rendered him always acceptable. This he saw,&#xD;
and, knowing well how to turn such an intercourse to&#xD;
his advantage, was not to be deterred by any obstacle.&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence, whatever might be 'his personal or na-&#xD;
tional aversions, was as yet sufficiently self-controlled not&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
S315&#xD;
&#xD;
to betray them in his own house; aid he continued&#xD;
to receive Captain Talbot, if not with the same pleas-&#xD;
ure, yet with a ceremonious politeness that left him&#xD;
nothing to complain of. There was no interruption,&#xD;
therefore, of his daily calls, often, by design or accident,&#xD;
protracted into the evening.&#xD;
"Bless me 1" he exclaimed one day, looking at his&#xD;
watch, after a long morning visit, "I have, I fear, Miss&#xD;
Lawrence, exceeded even your kindness. It is actual-&#xD;
ly the dinner-hour! Pardon me; it is surely as little&#xD;
my fault as my misfortune that you are all so charming&#xD;
as to render me oblivious of time and propriety ;" and he&#xD;
rose to depart; but a gently-uttered suggestion that he&#xD;
would remain was readily acceded to.&#xD;
The addition was n.~t agreeable to Mr. Lawrence; but&#xD;
the guest had. eminently the power of overcoming all&#xD;
barriers that coldness or dislike might interpose. The&#xD;
dinner over, while the ladies indulged with Cousin Phil&#xD;
in a by-talk of their own, the captain, in his most concil-&#xD;
iating tone, addressed Mr. Lawrence.&#xD;
"I do not think, sir, that I have seen an individual in&#xD;
America that, were I so disposed, I should be so tempt-&#xD;
ed to envy as yourself."&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence turned on him a look of inquiry.&#xD;
"After having so nobly periled life and fortune, to live&#xD;
to see your reward in the present success of the cause on&#xD;
which you staked them, and to foresee the glorious des-&#xD;
tiny you have contributed to secure! How many un-&#xD;
happy patriots have failed in similar attempts 1"&#xD;
"I have done no more than my duty," said Mr. Law-&#xD;
rence, coolly, "and no more than many others of my&#xD;
countrymen. As to the future, if the English and French&#xD;
will give us fair play, we shall do very well."&#xD;
"I am not surprised that you should entertain some&#xD;
doubts of us," replied the captain; "but of your tried&#xD;

friends, the French, you can, II should say, have no&#xD;

"Fear!" repeated the (Ad gentleman, emphatically, "1&#xD;

blooded and systematic. As to the mushroom ]I~evolu-&#xD;
tionary IDirectory of France, they have insulted, irritated,&#xD;
and inflamed us; but their day is nearly over. The&#xD;
French people I feel toward as every American should;&#xD;
but I do not desire to hear again '~a ira' and 'La Car&#xD;
magnole' sung in our streets, nor any other glorification&#xD;

liberty, 'glorious destiny,' and all that, it remains to be&#xD;
proved. I and my political friends are willing to trust&#xD;
the people as the only way of arriving at the fact. Our&#xD;
opponents are too fearful-that is their mistake."&#xD;
"I have no doubt you are right, sir. 'Tis Montes-&#xD;
quieu," coiitinued' fhe captain, in a deferential tone, "is&#xD;
it not, sir? who says that 'when the common people&#xD;
adopt good maxims, they adhere to them with more&#xD;
steadiness than those we call gentlemen.1"&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence, who had a great contempt for what he&#xD;
called "borrowing other people's thoughts for want of&#xD;
your own"-" standing on other men's legs" etc.-an&#xD;
swered' impatiently," I don't know nor don't care what&#xD;

we may wrangle over our favorite systems, yet we are&#xD;
true to our country; and that the charge of 'French in~~&#xD;
fluency,' and 'British gold,' and such stuff, is all~ d-d&#xD;
nonsense! No, sir! there is not a man in either party,&#xD;
'who dare call his soul his own, that the Directory or&#xD;
King George could buy."&#xD;
"Damns had not then had their day;" and, though the&#xD;
gentle admonitions of his daughter. and Mr. Lawrence's&#xD;

&#xD;
own convictions somewhat restrained his anathemas,&#xD;
there were occasions-like the present-.-when he could&#xD;
in no other way find relief; albeit the same may not here-&#xD;
in be reported.&#xD;
"I believe you, sir, I believe you," replied the cap.&#xD;
tam, with an acquiescent inclination of the head. "Those&#xD;
must take a narrow view of the capacities of men, who&#xD;
can not see that they require only a favorable position to&#xD;
realize all that philosophers have dreamed of human per-&#xD;
fectibility."&#xD;
"No, not 'perfectibility'-I hate that slang! Our&#xD;
people are no fools. They know their own interests.&#xD;
Give them a ~hance, and they'll work them out. There's&#xD;
no necessity to turn their heads with blarney about their&#xD;
'perfectibility.'"&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, sir, if the phrase offend you. I&#xD;
meant only to express my confidence, as felt by your.&#xD;
self; in human progress, when the obstacles that now ob.&#xD;
struct it shall be removed."&#xD;
These last words caught Eleanor's attention, who in-&#xD;
voluntarily exclaimed, "Captain Talbot! why, that is&#xD;
entirely different from what 'you used to say to papa-&#xD;
that 'people were so bad! so very bad! They could&#xD;
never govern themselves !' '~&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence turned a hasty and inquisitorial glance&#xD;
at the captain, who, not at all disconcerted by this charge&#xD;
of inconsistency, replied with a smile, "My dear Miss&#xD;
Eleanor, we are always learning, you kno~- and,'muoh&#xD;
as I liave been in your country, I am but just beginning&#xD;
to understand it."&#xD;
"If your opinions are so liable to change," said Mr.&#xD;
Lawrence, dryly, "you will probably see occasion to re-&#xD;
verse them again ;" and, with the air of one who thought&#xD;
them of very little consequence, be they' what they&#xD;

for farther conversation. It was the signal for leaving&#xD;
the table. Eleanor, at the same moment, withdrew to&#xD;
her room, Master Philip had an engagement, and the&#xD;
captain, declaring the day too fine to stay in the house,&#xD;
took his hat and sauntered off to the neighboring&#xD;
wood.&#xD;
"Gitty," said the old gentleman, after some prepara-&#xD;
tory impatient movements-" Gitty, does the captain&#xD;
come to see you ~&#xD;
"Me! Bless me, papa !" replied she, coloring, and al-&#xD;
ways startled at such~ a suggestion, "what put such an&#xD;
idea into your. head? No gentleman comes to see me,&#xD;
papa, you know."&#xD;
"I know you won't let them do so; 'tis your own&#xD;
fault if they don't; you are young enough and hand-&#xD;
some enough yet, if you'd believe it; but never mind&#xD;
that. The captain does not come to see you, you say.&#xD;
He does not come to see me, that's certain. He is not in&#xD;
love with me, for all his fine speeches; no, nor with&#xD;
Phil. Then who the devil does he come to see?"&#xD;
"Why, really, papa, no one, in the way you appear&#xD;
to think. He is an idle man in the country, finds your&#xD;
house agreeable, and therefore comes.~~&#xD;
"He won't find it so much longer, I can tell him."&#xD;
"But, papa, you know you gave him a general invita-&#xD;
tion to come, without ceremony, whenever he 'pleased."&#xD;
"Yes, but I did not tell him to come morning, noon,&#xD;
and night. He might as well come and sleep with me.&#xD;
Neither did I tell him to fix those infernal eyes of his&#xD;
on Eleanor all the time."&#xD;
* "E1ean~r, papa !"&#xD;
"Yes, ' Eleanor, papa!' Do you think, because I am&#xD;
old, I am a fool? * I can see more with my one eye&#xD;
than you with .both of yours, handsome as they are."&#xD;
"Well, but even if he has so absurd a purpose, as&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
you seem to think, YOU know, papa, he never could ef.&#xD;
feet it."&#xD;
"I don't know any such thing. You women are such&#xD;
cursed fools, if only a man pretend to, be dying in love&#xD;
with you! Beskies, don't you see how he has bejuggled&#xD;
her already? She is not, as she used to be, like a bird&#xD;
in the house; no-dull and moping, except when he is&#xD;
here, confound him! I tell you I won't have it. I'll&#xD;
break it up-I will;" and a tremendous stamp of the&#xD;
cane enforced the declaration.&#xD;
After a few moments, during which Miss Lawrence&#xD;
revolved how to divert his violence, he returned to the&#xD;
charge.&#xD;
"Gitty," exclaimed he, "I don't believe in that man!&#xD;
Who the devil is he? Nobody knows. He has been&#xD;
here, off and on, for years, yet he has no visible business.&#xD;
I tell you, he is a sharper, a swindler, an escaped con-&#xD;
vict, or some blasted thing or another-you'll see&#xD;
Miss Lawrence interposed by the mention of his good&#xD;
standing with several persons whom they knew, and es-&#xD;
pecially Mr. and Mrs. Meredith.&#xD;
"Oh, that's nothing! Meredith swallows any hook&#xD;
baited with an Englishman; and Janet is, by this time,&#xD;
I'll engage, only a reflection of him, though she was a&#xD;
sensible young woman when she lived at hoi~ie, and&#xD;
was allowed, to have an opinion of her own, poor thing!&#xD;
As to the other persons you speak of; there's nothing&#xD;
easier than to impose on people who are always running&#xD;
after foreigners. Have you forgotten that marriage, pre-&#xD;
vented almost at the last moment ?"&#xD;
"Marriage prevented !" repeated Miss Lawrence, with&#xD;
a strange, bewildered look.&#xD;
"Why, yes, child; what are you thinking about? I&#xD;
did it myself. The girl, very rich, very handsome, was&#xD;
crazy to marry a German soi-disant count or baron.&#xD;

WALTER TH0RNUEY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Some cautiouss friend suggested better security than his&#xD;
word. After time allowed to obtain credentials from&#xD;
home, they were produced, pronounced satisfactory, and&#xD;
the wedding was to take place immediately, when I traced&#xD;
the precious document to the very scrivener's in New&#xD;
York where the parchment was obtained. Yes, actual.&#xD;
ly fitted into the sheet front which it was cut-every&#xD;
identical notch and scallop! The marriage was broken&#xD;
oft; but the gui never forgave me for saving her. Now&#xD;
haven't I a right to call you women fools ?"&#xD;
Miss Lawrence answered only by a faint smile, and,&#xD;
glad to perceive that the recollections of the past had di.&#xD;
averted his anger, was careful not to revive it by an ex~&#xD;
postulation, hut, having adjusted his chair, left him to his&#xD;
afternoon's nap. This so far refreshed and composed&#xD;
him that, when the captain reappeared at tea, he was&#xD;
able to behave decently.&#xD;
Beautiful full moon withdrew Eleanor from the par.&#xD;
br, and then into a little paththat wound its way through&#xD;
the shrubbery. It was not long before the captain was&#xD;
by her side, rather to her regret, for she would have pre~&#xD;
feared to be alone, lie saw it-for what did he not&#xD;
see? and he addressed her&#xD;
pressed.~                thought, though not ex~&#xD;
"My dear young lady, you seek solitude; and why?&#xD;
because you are out of place here. Wherefore then re-.&#xD;
main ?"&#xD;
"No, indeed, not out of place, I hope, with some of my&#xD;
best friends; yet, to tell the truth, I should like now to&#xD;
return home."&#xD;
"And why not? Will you not trust, me to take you&#xD;
there ?'~&#xD;
"No, no," said she, shrinking from such a proposal;&#xD;
"I can not go now; I am not permitted to do so4"&#xD;

"Reasons-family reasons. I must stay as long as&#xD;
grandpapa wishes it."&#xD;
"Family reasons !" reflected the captain, doubting not&#xD;
that he divined them.&#xD;
"But," continued Eleanor, laughing, "if some good&#xD;
fairy would fly away with me, and I could wake to~&#xD;
morrow in mamma's arms, I should be delighted !"&#xD;
"Well, although I can not transport you through the&#xD;
air in a oar drawn by dragons, nor yet borrow, as more&#xD;
appropriate, the doves of Venus, I could find ways and&#xD;
means quite as effectual."&#xD;
"No, no; I must stay-for a short time, at least;. so&#xD;
don't talk of it."&#xD;
"I won't talk of it," said the captain, emphatically;&#xD;
"you are not to be compromised; I understand that;&#xD;
but-but-we shall see."&#xD;
Eleanor returned, carelessly, the smile with which this&#xD;
was said; then, aftet' a few moments, added, "We make&#xD;
very free with spirits, 'black, white, and gray,' and yet&#xD;
I doubt if even you would not rather face any thing 0g&#xD;
'mortal mould' than little Queen Mab, or a-"&#xD;
"Haunted chamber" interrupt~ the captain.&#xD;
Her countenance changed, and, perceiving it, he fell&#xD;
into her mood.&#xD;
"To be serious," said he, "I do not know but that a&#xD;
Highland nurse may have disposed me to treat such&#xD;
things reverently."&#xD;
"What! really to believe in them ?" asked she, anx-&#xD;
iously; "in warnings and forebodings ?"&#xD;
The captain turned on her an inquiring look. After&#xD;
a pause that gave effect to his words, he said, "It is not&#xD;
for us to say how far a weak or sinful purpose may be&#xD;
defeated, or a good one confirmed, by what you call&#xD;
'warnings.' As to their reality in any given case, the&#xD;
individual conscience might furnish the test. For in-&#xD;

stance, if pursuing a course of passion or disobedience,&#xD;
an admonition of danger might be given-'&#xD;
'~ You think so?" said she, more struck by his manner&#xD;
than by the personal application that was perhaps in-&#xD;
tended, and which her innocence rejected.&#xD;
"But, in saying this," continued he, "I do but repeat&#xD;
what has been better said by a' quaint old English writer&#xD;
-that 'the highest spirits may be constantly attendant&#xD;
on the service of man, not on account of his great im-&#xD;
portance, but because he is the only poor creature that&#xD;
wants their assistance.' But surely, my dear Miss Ele-&#xD;
anor, these inquiries have no foundation in your own ex-&#xD;
perience ?"&#xD;
* If this were said to draw from her any admissions, it&#xD;
failed of its object. There was something in his tone&#xD;
and look that did not invite confidence; and she felt re-&#xD;
lieved, when Pomp appeared in search of her, with a&#xD;
message from massa for "young missis to come in de&#xD;
house right away, or she cotch cold."&#xD;
'She obeyed, though a little' wondering at this usuall&#xD;
timidity on her account, but found the temperature with-&#xD;
in much lower than without. Her grandfather was at&#xD;
zero, Phil at the freezing-point, and her aunt shivering&#xD;
but little above, only prevented the same tapid descent&#xD;
by her habitual politeness. The captain, entirely un-&#xD;
chilled, appeared not to perceive the change. Thus&#xD;
passed a weary half-hour, during which neither conver-&#xD;
sation, cards, music, nor kind looks relieved the dead&#xD;
weight which had fallen on all but the one for whom it&#xD;
was intended.&#xD;
Unabashed by what he, nevertheless, perfectly under-.&#xD;
stood, Captain Talbot took his own way to meet it.&#xD;
'Rising to depart, and approaching Mr. Lawrence with&#xD;
great respect, he expressed his sense of his generous&#xD;
hospitality, his unvarying kindness.-strongly empha-&#xD;

sized-the pleasure I~e had enjoyed under his roof, and&#xD;
his concern eating compelled to leave them. Turning&#xD;
to Miss Lawrence, he proffered much the same in less&#xD;
formal terms; then thanked Master Philip for his very&#xD;
agreeable companionship and many polite attentions;&#xD;
assuring them all that nothing had been omitted on&#xD;
their part that could conduce to his high gratification;&#xD;
and, addressing Eleanor particularly, he begged for her&#xD;
commands to her parents, as he should return to the&#xD;
city the following' day. She, as much surprised, but&#xD;
less disturbed than the rest--who, in their honesty, felt&#xD;
as if the captain had read their thoughts, and had con-&#xD;
victed them of the meanest behavior-gave him her&#xD;
hand frankly, accompanied by regret for his sudden de-&#xD;
parture. Then, with~ a parting glance to all, in which&#xD;
might have been detected his satisfaction at the recoil&#xD;
of the enemy's projectile, he bowed himself out.&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence was the first to break the silence that&#xD;
ensued.&#xD;
With a long expiration, to allow his suppressed breath&#xD;
to escape, he exclaimed, "Now, I should be glad to&#xD;
know what the devil that means? Haven't I been civil?&#xD;
Haven't I been polite? 'Haven't I been hospitable ?" in&#xD;
the way in which persons conscious of a failure seek to&#xD;
be justified.&#xD;
"Haven't I too ?" gently inquired Miss Gertrude.&#xD;
"And haven't I?" asked Philip, uneasily.&#xD;
"And haven't I?" exclaimed Eleanor, with a mis-&#xD;
chievous smile at the absurdity of the scene.&#xD;
"Oh, you, indeed 1" said Phil, reproachfully. "That's&#xD;
well for you to ask-the cause of all the trouble !"&#xD;
"Me, Phil? why I am the only innocent one."&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence, recovering from his first feeling of an-&#xD;
noyance, took another view of the matter, that turned&#xD;
the scale in his own favor. "A, stranger had presumed&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
A FEW days after, the quiet morning of Miss Lawrence&#xD;
and Eleanor was broken in upon by Phyllis, who rush-&#xD;
ed up-stairs to inform them that a peddler was beloW.&#xD;
At that time, when the country shops were few and&#xD;
very indifferent, these itinerant traders were generally&#xD;
acceptable, especially in the. female world. Miss Ger-&#xD;
trude, therefore, having recollected various small wants,&#xD;
prepared to go down, followed by Eleanor chiefly for&#xD;
the novelty.&#xD;
The man had been directed to come into the porlacd,&#xD;
and there, surrounded by the servants, old and young,&#xD;
big and little, he opened his pack and displayed his&#xD;
wares. He was a sturdy, hale-looking man, not young,&#xD;
but with such a merry eye and mirthful face no one&#xD;
could be old. These, a slight limp, and certain Yankee&#xD;
peculiarities proclaimed our friend Jed, whose profes-&#xD;
sional wanderings had led him hither.&#xD;
He cast a look of more than usual inquiry at the la-&#xD;
dies as they approached, in answer to which Aunt Flore&#xD;
said, "Dese yere is my young misseses"-Flore always&#xD;
persisting in thus styling Miss Gertrude, distinguishing&#xD;
Eleanor, when necessary, as "t'oder young missis," or&#xD;
"de young missis from York."&#xD;
Jed kept his eye on them.&#xD;
"One looks older than t'other," thought he, "she's&#xD;
pretty-lookin', though; but she can't be the one, though&#xD;
she's more suitable."&#xD;
Having thus communed with himself, he said, "Well,&#xD;
ladies, here's my shop-d call it my universall !'-Mus-&#xD;
lins, silks, shawls, stocking's, gloves, pins, needles, scis~&#xD;

&#xD;
sors, knives, tapes, ribbons; every thing that women&#xD;
folks can waut.-.except sweethearts, and these 'ere will&#xD;
bring them~ too. No offense, I hope ?"&#xD;
The servants giggled.&#xD;
"If ole massa was here," said Pomp aside to Phyllis,&#xD;
"guess he'd send him to a wuss place, if he talk dat, ar&#xD;
way to young missis. Jess right for you, Phyllis."&#xD;
"Yelly be still 1" replied she, with a reproving nudge.&#xD;
Jed's quick eye detected a joke, and he turned it to&#xD;
his own account. Holding up a bright plaid cotton&#xD;
handkerchief--an imitation of those called Madras-&#xD;
"Here," said he to Phyllis, "is the very article for your&#xD;
head! and only four shillin's, lawfuL"&#xD;
She looked admiringly, but hesitated.&#xD;
"If you can't make it out, that 'ere young fellow will&#xD;
give it~to you; I see it in his eye.~~&#xD;
"Cock's pottie up for her den !" retorted Pomp. "She&#xD;
better get it, put roun' my t'roat 'stead ob her calabash I"&#xD;
Phyllis pouted; but good-natured, fat Aunt Minty&#xD;
brought back the smile, saying, "Neber you mine him,&#xD;
Phylly-impurent nigger !".&#xD;
While she folded and refolded the tempting handker-&#xD;
chieg Jed assailed Aunt Flore with a cotton shawl over-&#xD;
spread with flowers of the largest size and brightest col-&#xD;
ors, but of i~o particular genera or order.&#xD;
"There!" said he, throwing it over her shoulders adroit-&#xD;
ly as a Broadway ~hopman of the present day, and with&#xD;
much the same recommendation, "there's a splendid ar.'&#xD;
tide! If that don't suit you, why, you can't be suited--&#xD;
that's all."&#xD;
"Oh, Hughey! carry me out, and berry me decent !"&#xD;
exclaimed Pomp; "why, Aunt Flore, Uncle Mink neb-&#xD;
~r know he own wife."&#xD;
"Get 'long, you' eberlastin' nigger, you I" replied she,&#xD;
enforcing her words xvith a push that sent him against&#xD;
&#xD;
the wall; "you always t'ink de boat neber can't cross&#xD;
widout your oar&#xD;
The rebuke would probably have failed to check the&#xD;
flow of Pomp's wit, had not the attention of Miss Law-&#xD;
rence, hitherto occupied in her own selection from among&#xD;
the divers small packages spread before her, been now&#xD;
attracted to what was going on; and, desirous to pre-&#xD;
vent imposition on the servants, she approached. While&#xD;
she watched over and advised their purchases, Momma&#xD;
Zip entered, and, making her 6ourtesy to Jed, endeav-&#xD;
ored to explain her wants.&#xD;
"Poor old cre'ter!" said he, "I can't make nothing' out&#xD;
of her."&#xD;
Diving into her pocket, she produced a tobacco-box,&#xD;
and this. symbol was intelligible.&#xD;
Jed shook his head.&#xD;
"No, no; I only trade in ladies' notions. They nev-&#xD;
er want that, unless," with a wink, "a little 'Ihidies'&#xD;
twist,' you know. But stop; let me see," and he drew&#xD;
from his pocket a paper of the kind desired; "there;&#xD;
I always keep that 'ere sort for my own use," at the&#xD;
same time putting a pinch in his mouth; "this will sup.&#xD;
port natur till I can get more; and now, old woman,&#xD;
you shall have the rest; and stay! here's a nice new&#xD;
pipe for you. I keep pipes 'cause sometimes mothers&#xD;
want 'em for their children to blow bubbles." Then,&#xD;
turning to Eleanor, who stood near him: "For that mat-&#xD;
ter, we all blow bubbles, miss, don't we, all our days?&#xD;
I hope your'n won't burst too soon. Now, Goody,&#xD;
you're fixed, I guess. No, no; I don't want any of&#xD;
your pennies. I mistrust you never got your own yet&#xD;
in this world. I won't take nothing' from you-no&#xD;
rate."&#xD;
Momma's gratitude found expression in repeated&#xD;
courtesies, and she drew on one side, thus giving Jed&#xD;
an opportunity of addressing Eleanor.&#xD;

"A~id what shall Isellyon, my pretty lady ?" said he.&#xD;
Pleased with his kindness to Momma,'Eleanor endeav-&#xD;
ored to think of something.'&#xD;
"Have you poeket.~handkerchiefs?" she asked.&#xD;
"Sartin-plenty on 'em; just made for your little&#xD;
lily hand too ;" bringing forth some, to which, without&#xD;
vanity, Eleanor might have assigned a less distinguished&#xD;
destination.~ She looked rather dubious, but bought&#xD;
some.&#xD;
"Perhaps you'd like picter ones too ?"&#xD;
"Picture ones ?"&#xD;
"Yes, miss, very musical ~tnd instructive too. Here's&#xD;
one ;" and he displayed one on which was stamped a&#xD;
chronological arrangementt of the kings and queens of&#xD;
England. The names, surmounted with a crown, were&#xD;
placed within circles, sometimes attended also by em-&#xD;
blematical allusions to circumstances or events connect-&#xD;
ed with them; as, for instance, seven smaller crowns en-&#xD;
circling the name of Egbert; William Rufus accompa-&#xD;
nied by an arrow; a lamprey coiled around the name of&#xD;
Henry I.; the garter twined round Edward ILL; and two&#xD;
circles, one inscribed Henry VII., the other Elizabeth,&#xD;
were connected by a knot of ribbons, the ends of which&#xD;
formed a scroll, on' which was written a couplet more&#xD;
convenient as stating a fact than admirable as poetry:&#xD;
"York and Lancaster united were&#xD;
By Henry's marriage with Eliza fair."&#xD;
This was, in Jed's estimation, a production of high art.&#xD;
"There 1" said he, triumphantly,"' buy that, and you'll&#xD;
have it all at' ur fingers' ends, as a body may say. If&#xD;
that isn't bein' lamed at small expense, I should like to&#xD;

hang it up in your keepin'-room, always handy."&#xD;
Perceiving that it did not take, 'much to his surprise,&#xD;
he proceeded to another.&#xD;

"Well, then, here's one';" exhibiting Tippo Saib sur-&#xD;
rendering his two sons as hostages to Lord Cornwallis.&#xD;
"Now did you ever see any thing more' affection ? I'm&#xD;
sure such a tender-hearted young lady must have feel-&#xD;
in's at such a sight! And then to think that jest so we&#xD;
should have had to take it, if it hadn't been for the old&#xD;
Continentals, and the rest. Every thing gin up---our&#xD;
fortins to the crown and our necks to the halter! Awful!&#xD;
miss, eh---and only jest two shillin's, 'lawful-"&#xD;
But Eleanor's feeling's " were only excited to laughter.&#xD;
"AU I see you don't understand these things like&#xD;
those that has saved. Well, I can't blame you; that's&#xD;
natural. But here is something' that'll come nearer home."&#xD;
And he spread out one on which was printed the old&#xD;
Scotch song "Whistle and I'll come to you, my lad ;"&#xD;
and, in illustration, a young girl was represented at a&#xD;
cottage door, with eyes directed to a distant stile, on&#xD;
which leaned a youth, who, with lover-like expression,&#xD;
seemed watching her approach.&#xD;
"Now that," said Jed, closely observing Eleanor&#xD;
"that I call a speaking' thing. Don't you see her eyes&#xD;
melting' like, and her lips movin'? Don't you seem to&#xD;
hear his whistle, clear as a sky-lark? Lord bless my old&#xD;
body! it makes me .young agin jest to look at it. I feel&#xD;
e'en ~~most as if it was I myself."&#xD;
Eleanor's laugh encouraged him. "And so do you&#xD;

chamber window, a known' that somebody was a wait-&#xD;
in' for you down yonder at the eend of the road, or the&#xD;
'awenoo' as the quality calls it."&#xD;
To check applications so familiar and personal, she re-&#xD;
plied coldly, "No, I don't fancy any of these. Have you&#xD;
any lead-pencils?"&#xD;
"Sartinly, Jed Cooley never fails;" and he handed&#xD;

Eleanor examined the tablet, admitted its usefulness,&#xD;
and kept it.&#xD;
"Perhaps you don't quite see into it yet; let me show&#xD;

fecting to write in the tablet as he. spoke-" that you'd&#xD;
got to meet him at nitme o'clock tomorrow evening, at&#xD;
the eend of the road, a little beyond the gate. Bein' put&#xD;
down here you can't forget,' you know'; and so"-taking&#xD;
a slip~ of paper from his pocket-." I'll jest put that 'in&#xD;
to mark the place, and to 'show you that I am under or-&#xD;
ders from the right one." Then, in a still lower tone, he&#xD;
added, "If you won't come, miss, you have nothing ' to&#xD;
do but to shake your head."&#xD;
Putting the pencil in its place, and folding the tablet&#xD;
up quickly, he looked sharply and inquiringly at her as&#xD;

&#xD;
he put it into her hand; while she, amazed, bewildered,&#xD;
and not as yet clearly comprehending, received it pas-&#xD;
sively, and made no sign.&#xD;
Satisfied with this, he proceeded to bundle up his&#xD;
wares with all dispatch, and Eleanor, trying to collect&#xD;
her thoughts, was devising how best to reprove his im-&#xD;
pertinen~e, 'when Mr. Lawrence entered, and she saw&#xD;
that she must remain quiet if she would avoid a violent&#xD;
scene.&#xD;
With a frown directed against the unwelcome peddler,&#xD;
he exelairued, in an angry tone,." Another of these ver-&#xD;
min! I wonder, Gertrude, you will encourage them.&#xD;
They bring nothing but trash, and cheat the poor devils&#xD;
out of the little money they have."&#xD;
His daughter assured him that this man was an~ ex~&#xD;
ception-that he brought good and reasonable things,&#xD;
such as the neighborhood did not furnish.&#xD;
Encouraged by this, Jed reopened his pack, and of-&#xD;
fered to Mr. Lawrence's inspection a snuff-box of glitter-&#xD;
ing material, gaudily ornamented, with a smile of the&#xD;
most imperturbable good-humor.&#xD;
"There, sir, is not that the thinr? Look at it and ex-&#xD;
amine it carefully' as you please, sir; inside' and out.&#xD;
Why, wouldd pass for gold, sir,!"&#xD;
To ask Mr. Lawrence's approval of a sham of any&#xD;
kind was to insult, him past bearing, and the manner&#xD;
rendered it even more offensive.&#xD;
"You infernal Yankee knave !" he exclaimed," do you&#xD;
offer me a pinchbeck snuffbox? Pass for gold! yes, as&#xD;
you pass for an honest man! with a fair outside. March!&#xD;
begone with' your Yankee shams! If ever you darken&#xD;
my doors again I'll have you tossed in a blanket 'I'll&#xD;
set the dogs on you !"&#xD;
Jed was not a man' to be frightened by a few hard&#xD;
words. .With no haste, and perfect composure, he re-&#xD;

&amp;amp;32          WALTER THORNLli~Y; OR,&#xD;
placed the box, strapped his pack, threw it' over his&#xD;
shoulder, then, standing erect, and planting his staff&#xD;
firmly on the floor, he said, I' Good-day to you, sir!&#xD;
May the doors of your house never be darkened by&#xD;
notbin' worse than an 'old Continental,' who has shed&#xD;
his blood to prop its foundation, and to keep your head&#xD;
in its own place. As to the blanket, if you'd a been so&#xD;
gin'rous as to send it to Valley Forge, when I lay there&#xD;
a freezing' for you, 'twou'd been about right; at present&#xD;
I have no occasion." Then, making a military salute to&#xD;
the ladies, and nodding pleasantly to the servants, he&#xD;
marched oft; in his own ~dew, " with colors flying,"&#xD;
leaving Mr. Lawrence in that 'agreeable perplexity when&#xD;
a person knows not if he has had the best or the worst&#xD;
in a contest he has himself needlessly provoked.&#xD;
Jed's clear whistle, succeeded by&#xD;
"Old King Cole was a jolly old soul,&#xD;
And a jolly old soul was he 1"&#xD;
was heard as he struck' into the avenue, along which he&#xD;
presently perceived himself to be followed by the house-&#xD;
dog, Brag, whose suspicions were awakened by the loud&#xD;
tones attending his exit from the hopse, but who satisfied&#xD;
himself with the intention of seeing him off the premises.&#xD;
This was, however, delayed by Jed's choosing a shady&#xD;
spot near the gate, and seating himself, at the same time&#xD;
opening a wallet suspended at his side. From this he.&#xD;
drew forth the remains of his dinner; and, having pur-&#xD;
posely put the wind "between his nobility" and Brag's&#xD;
nose, the latter soon caught the perfume of a mutton-&#xD;
bone, which 'certified so satisfactorily to the character&#xD;
of the stranger that he drew nearer to cultivate his ac-&#xD;
quaintance.&#xD;
"Ay, I thought so," soliloquized Jed; "I thought so.&#xD;
But ~it isn't nothing' agin' him; he's no worse, n&amp;amp;r' half so&#xD;
bad, as human cre'ters who are bribed every day. Some&#xD;

&#xD;
for honor, some for profit, some for pleasure; for hun.&#xD;
ger, rale hunger, like him, least of all. There, sir," said&#xD;
he, throwing a bone to Brag, whose teeth snapped it in&#xD;
a second, "211 may have a call to these 'ere parts agin,&#xD;
spite of that fractious old gentleman. It's always well&#xD;
to have a friend at court they say, and so I gin'rally&#xD;
make a p'int of standin' well with the dogs. I don't&#xD;
care for his blanket; 'twou'd take more than all his nig-&#xD;
gers to get Jed Cooley into that consarn. But dog's&#xD;
teeth a'n't favorable. So-here--.--you, ~what's your name?&#xD;
there's another bone; remember me if ever you see me&#xD;
agin ;" and, patting him on the head, a familiarity Brag&#xD;
authorized by a condescending wag of his tail, "now&#xD;
we're friends," a conclusion that the dog seemed to ad-&#xD;
mit by stretching himself on the grass at his side.&#xD;
"Now," said Jed, reposing in like manner, "let me&#xD;
consider. It's always well to look all round when one's&#xD;
standing' on 'slippery ground,7 as the psalm-book say;&#xD;
and I feel kind o' skittish about this business. Let me&#xD;
go it oyer to myself. Well, as 111 come along this morn-&#xD;
in', a skirting' that 'ere wood yonder, a man-that is, a&#xD;
gentleman-meets me. At first, he was shy, all kiver'd&#xD;
up in his cloak, for all 'twas hot enough to melt a body,&#xD;
and his hat draw'd over his eyes. Presently he seemed&#xD;
to bethink himself; and turned toward me. So, as I al-&#xD;
ways like to be friendly and~ to give the time o' day, if&#xD;
nothing' else, I tips him a salute. With that, says he,&#xD;
'Where be you a goin'?' 'Sir,' says I, I am a goin' to&#xD;
sell you so'thin' out of my pack, if so be I can suit you&#xD;
-knives, pipes, neckerchieg stocking's and so'forth,' un-&#xD;
strappin' at the same time. But he looked kind o' sharp&#xD;
and uneasy, and would not hear me. 'I mean,' says he,&#xD;
'what place are you goin' to?' 'Oh,' says I, 'to~ that&#xD;
'ere bi~ house 'mong the trees.' 'Ay,' says he, 'all right.&#xD;

taking off my hat, 'cause I always lay out to be civil.&#xD;
I larn'd that at school. Well, then he stopped to con-&#xD;
sider, looking at me as if he expected to see clean to my&#xD;
backbone, but I never dodged a bit. Then says he,&#xD;
'Can you be trusted?' flinging me a piece* of money at&#xD;
the same time, jest as I threw a mutton-bone to this 'ere&#xD;
dog. 'Hope I can, sir,' says I. 'Well, then,' says he,&#xD;
'you'll see a pretty young lady at that big house-just&#xD;
ask her to meet a friend here to-morrow evening' at nine&#xD;
o'olock-~...-you understand,' says he, putting' his ~1nger to&#xD;
his nose, so~ 'I expect I do, sir,' says I, but I s'pose I&#xD;
laughed, for he looked desperate angry7 and said, 'What&#xD;
do you mean, sir?' 'Oh, nothing, ' says II, but you paid&#xD;

if I did?' 'Oh, nothing , sir, only there's no disputing'&#xD;

'No matter for that,' says he, 'only do as I bid you.'&#xD;
"Now, thinks I, when a feller is shy of tellin' his&#xD;
name he's ugly-specially when I'd gin him mine so&#xD;
freely. However, I'll fix him for that yet. Then says&#xD;
I, 'I'm an old soldier. I'm used, on secret service, to&#xD;
give a watch-word.' 'No matter for that,' says he, very&#xD;
sharp. But presently, considering, he says, 'Stay, you're&#xD;
right;' and, taking out a slip of paper, he writes some-&#xD;
'thin' on"t wizh a pencil. "Therc,~ says he, give her&#xD;

and staff; and giving Brag a farewell pat, he issued from&#xD;
the gate, andr after proceeding a short distance in the&#xD;
neighboring w~iod, encountered a gentleman evidently&#xD;
on the watch for him. His slouched hat and large cloak&#xD;
concealed much of his face and person, and' in a voice&#xD;
subdued to harshness, he said, "What success?"&#xD;
"Your arrant's did, sir," said Jed, "straight as an ar-&#xD;
row."&#xD;
"And she will come ?"&#xD;
"Sartin, sir; she understood the signals; all cor-&#xD;
rect"&#xD;
Putting a piece of money into Jed's hand7 according&#xD;
to contract, he was silent for some minutes, during which&#xD;
Jed tossed up the crown with a careless, satisfied air,&#xD;
and the stranger surveyed him with a scrutinizing gaze.&#xD;
"An intelligent fellow," said he, thinking aloud.&#xD;
"Yes, sir," said Jed, "just so," still playing with the&#xD;
money.&#xD;
"Pray what has been your business heretofore? You&#xD;
called yourself a soldier, though your drilling seems&#xD;
rather rusty at present."&#xD;
"I started, sir, at the plow-tail; did all kind of farm-&#xD;
work. Then the war broke out, and I was drafted into&#xD;
the militia. Then I served in the reg'lars-right old&#xD;
Ooi1~inen'ta3, 31 tell you. ~There I got this 'ere/' rapping&#xD;
his leg with his stick. "When the war was over I drove&#xD;
a stage near on to a year; but goin' all weathers, night&#xD;
and day, didn't suit this 'ere pesky leg, so I gave in, and&#xD;
took to peddlin'-at your service, sir," with a touch of&#xD;
his hat.&#xD;
"Ah t you have driven four-in-hand for a year," said&#xD;
the gentleman, approvingly; "and you call yourself a&#xD;
good and safe driver?"&#xD;
Jed, with a look of rather indignant surprise, answer-&#xD;
ed, "I-guess-I-do !"&#xD;

3$6          WALTER TfiORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
Again the gentleman paused, and again communed&#xD;
with himself. "I must trust some one;" then said&#xD;
aloud, "Is your business finished here ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, for the present, about done."&#xD;
"Haste you any acquaintances in these parts?"&#xD;
"Nor sir; iDut~h people an~I Yankees JonYt step ~vell&#xD;
together: one's too slow, t'other too quick."&#xD;
"Thei~ you will proceed from. here to your home ?"&#xD;
"Sartin; only stopping' to accommodate folks on the&#xD;
way."&#xD;
Again the gentleman looked and hesitated; then, as&#xD;
if suddenly deciding, said, "Be here at nine to-morrow&#xD;
evening-.no, a quarter before. A carriage and pair of&#xD;
horses will be secured at the edge 'of the wood, on that&#xD;
farther side. Having reported yourself to me here, I&#xD;
will give you farther orders. When the lady comes,&#xD;
you must be ready to assist her. She may be a little&#xD;
overcome by fear-of pursuit, I mean-and unable to&#xD;
walk to the carriage. You understand? Ladies have&#xD;
not always the courage to do the very thing they most&#xD;
desire, and are grateful for a little gentle force. You&#xD;
understand ?"&#xD;
Jed's face wore an expression of entire and approving&#xD;
comprehension.&#xD;
"Just so, sir. Land! I haven't seen the world for&#xD;
nothing . I'm up to a thing! women folks 'mongst the*&#xD;
rest. They are the charmin'est cre'ters in the world,&#xD;
sir, but they don't never know their own minds. Well,&#xD;
sir~ and how long will you want me ?"&#xD;
Without replying directly, the gentleman said, "'Tis&#xD;
thirteen miles to the lower landing; do you know the&#xD;
road ?"&#xD;
"Yes~ sir, perfectly; have tramped it more than once."&#xD;
"It is in good order; I came over it to.day~ Two&#xD;

"When there, you will be dismissed. The carriage&#xD;

"And the driver who brings it here?" asked Jed?&#xD;
"what comes of him?"&#xD;
"That driver will be myself. I shall have something&#xD;
else to do when I go back. You understand ?"&#xD;
"Oh, sartin, sartin! all right! Iguess I'm up to trap&#xD;

"Yes, I see .you take me. Obey orders, and your pay&#xD;
shall be such as shall satisfy 'you, of which I give you&#xD;
this as earnest-money."&#xD;
"Thank you, sir," said Jed, rejecting it; "I'll be paid&#xD;
when the job's done, if you please."&#xD;
"Well, that's honest. I feel sure of you. A quarter&#xD;
before~ nine to-morrow evening ;" and he disappeared&#xD;
into the wood, leaving Jed in a musing posture, nibbling&#xD;
the head of his staff. After some moments he struck it&#xD;
to the ground, and exclaimed, "Well, it's a risky busi~&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
As Jed departed, his customer~, gathering their pur-&#xD;
chases, scattered, congratulating themselves that their&#xD;
traffic had not been sooner interrupted.&#xD;
Eleanor had a subject of more serious thought. De-&#xD;
feated in her purpose of returning the tablet to the ped-&#xD;
dler, with a proper rebuke for his conduct, she sought a&#xD;
retired seat in the garden, to review the matter calmly.&#xD;
In doing so, she recollected his having written in the&#xD;
tablet, and she referred to it in the expectation of farther&#xD;
light. She found nothing intelligible; but on the slip&#xD;
of paper he had inserted as a mark was the following:&#xD;
"The keel to the wave, the hand to the oar,&#xD;
And the boat to the maiden that sits on the shore."&#xD;
The dim, vague hope suggested by the first address of&#xD;
the peddler, but rejected by her better sense, and then&#xD;
frowned down by her displeasure, at these words re-&#xD;
viveci irrepressibly. Read and re-read, at every instant&#xD;
it gained confirmation. "What could they be but a to-&#xD;
ken, an assurance, from the only person who knew of&#xD;
their interview, and the real significance of this allusion&#xD;
to the boat?, And who could that person be but Wal-&#xD;
ter? Who but he could furnish such a credential ?"&#xD;
But again: "Could he, would he, ask her thus to meet&#xD;
him?" Her heart beat the response. "Her earnest pro-&#xD;
hibition against entering the house would naturally pre-&#xD;
vent his now attempting it. If he asked a meeting un-'&#xD;
der such circumstances, it must be I~r reasons that would&#xD;
justify it. It was the last thing he would do, unless&#xD;
compelled."&#xD;
Her own dislike to a violation of decorum rose in op.&#xD;
&#xD;
position. "How~cou1d she, alone, in the shade of even~-&#xD;
ing, unauthorized by the permission or' even knowledge&#xD;
of the friends who had' the right to direct her, go at the&#xD;
call of one who-she could not deny it-might prove a&#xD;
person unworthy of the confidence? What would her&#xD;
father, the stern advocate of female propriety; what&#xD;
would her mother, whose gentle dignity repressed all&#xD;
thoughtless compromise of delicacy, say to such a pro-&#xD;
ceeding ?" She' became faint and cold. "But then, if&#xD;
it should be Walter. He could only come on angels' er-&#xD;
rands! Ought I not to trust him? Can I bear to dis-&#xD;
appoint him? to make it apparent that I have not faith&#xD;
in him? What shall I do? what shall I do ?"&#xD;
A summons to tea found the question unanswered~&#xD;
As she entered the house she met Philip, attended by&#xD;
his dogs, jumping and barking around him 'with noisy&#xD;
delight at his sporting preparations, in which they un-&#xD;
derstood their co-partnership.&#xD;
"Ah! Eleanor, well met. I~ have been looking the&#xD;
house over for you, to say good-by. Not, however," in&#xD;
answer to her look of inquiry, "not for very long. I&#xD;
am going down to yonng Morton's to-night. We start&#xD;
early in the morning for a shooting ramble of a day or&#xD;
two. I take my dogs, for I can not trust' his."&#xD;
"You don't take. Brag, II hope."&#xD;
"No, of course not2" said he,' laughing; "he would be&#xD;
rather more plague than profit. But why do you ask?&#xD;
Not from fear?"&#xD;
"Oh no, there's nothing to be afraid of. But of late&#xD;
I'm not so profound a sleeper as usual; and I like to&#xD;
hear the old fellow going his rounds at night, talking to&#xD;
the moon, or challenging the neighbor dogs. it i~ com-&#xD;
panionship, and, when wakeful, 'tis quite agreeable."&#xD;
"Pshaw 1" said Phil, with an impatient gesture, "here's&#xD;
that'confounded pistol. I have been showing it to Mor~-&#xD;

ton and forgot to put it away. I must run u~ stairs&#xD;
with it at once. Excuse me; I have not a minute to&#xD;
spare. I dare not leave it here; that fellow, Pomp, will&#xD;
be trying experiments with it."&#xD;
"Give it to me; I'll take care of it for you."&#xD;
"Will you? that's very kind. I would not trouble&#xD;
you, but Morton's waiting for me. But take care; the&#xD;
charge is not drawn. You're not afraid ?"&#xD;
"No, indeed! thanks to your instruction."&#xD;
"Well, good-night." But, holding her hand, he lin-&#xD;
ge ed a moment.&#xD;
"Give me credit, Eleanor. Only once have I spoken&#xD;
to her! and that once," with a sort of shudder, "what&#xD;
was it?"&#xD;
~' I don't know about the pleasure of speaking," said&#xD;
Eleanor laughing, "if that is its effect."&#xD;
"Ah! you do not know how much harder silence is&#xD;
than all things else-how should you? But one of these&#xD;
days, my fair insensible cousin! Good-night !"&#xD;
"One of these days !" thought Eleanor, and she went&#xD;
to her room, where relieving herself of hat, shawl, and&#xD;
pistol, she descended to the parlor.&#xD;
Much to her satisfaction, her grandfather showed no&#xD;
trace of the irritation the peddler had ex~ited. On the&#xD;
contrary, he was kinder than usual of late.&#xD;
"Come, Leentje"-a Dutch diminutive for Eleanor he.&#xD;
sornetiinesusedwhen ma petting mood-" come, Leentje,"&#xD;
said he, "this evening we'll have cards, and you shall&#xD;
choose. Dummy, or. piquet, or cribbage;" and the even-&#xD;
ing passed off pleasantly.&#xD;
There are all kinds of ill-temper in the world-~-capri-&#xD;
cious, irritable, passionate, sulky, malignant. No one of&#xD;
these would express that which nature or circumstance&#xD;
had conferred on Mr. Lawrence. lie was not capricious,&#xD;
because he always believed himself acting from sufficient&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE J'AST.         341&#xD;
&#xD;
cause-if irritable and passionate, yet, when least looked&#xD;
for, gentle and forbearing-roused to fury by the small-&#xD;
est opposition, yet capable of the most generous volun-&#xD;
tary surrender-sympathizing with truth, courage, and&#xD;
liberty, yet habitually a despot; and, if not thus making&#xD;
hypocrites of others, it was either that their fine natures&#xD;
were impossible to evil, or that his own better impulses&#xD;
operated as a corrective. Sulky or malignant he could&#xD;
never be. Of all epithets, one of uncertain etymology,&#xD;
and, like himself; difficult to define, was most applicable&#xD;
-he was a queer man.&#xD;
Eleanor retired, but not to sleep. Leaving her candle&#xD;
in the little back room she sometimes dignified as her&#xD;
"study," she passed into the other, in the front of. the&#xD;
house, and, seating herself by the window, she looked out&#xD;
into the quiet night,&#xD;
"So quiet, that even the motIon of. an angel's wing&#xD;
Would interrupt the intense tranquillity&#xD;
Of silent hills, and more than silent sky."&#xD;
The moon, high in the clear blue heaven, offered to&#xD;
the upcast eye an image of unruffled majesty, while, re-&#xD;
flected from the ever-moving waters below, though still&#xD;
beautiful, she trembled.&#xD;
"So it is 1" thought Eleanor. "Even the loveliest&#xD;
things are often dimmed and distorted here. 'Tis only&#xD;
in heaven that they are perfect. So even with our af-&#xD;
fections." And again her troubled mind debated with&#xD;
itself; "What should she do ?"&#xD;
She regretted ~now that she had not consulted with&#xD;
Philip. . She knew she could trust him, that he would&#xD;
have remained at home if she desired it, would have&#xD;
watched over her safety if necessary. "But, then, how&#xD;
make partial disclosures to him? and, still more difficult;&#xD;
how tell all? No, it could not be."&#xD;
"Then," naturally courageous except when assailed&#xD;

by fears of things unreal, she thought," what could harm&#xD;
me here, within our own bounds ?"&#xD;
In this conflict with herself; at one moment renounc-&#xD;
ing the idea, at another incapable of so doing, she sud.-&#xD;
denly reflected, "He has just returned from the city; he&#xD;
has seen mamma; he said he should. He brings me a&#xD;
message from her! Oh yes, it must be so! and then I&#xD;
must, I ought to see him !"&#xD;
Truth to tell, she was but too ready to say, with St.&#xD;
Francis, "I do not know how that poor virtue ,prudence&#xD;
hath offended me, but I can not cordially like it." So&#xD;
lately regretting even what seemed a necessary conceal-&#xD;
ment, she was now about to commit deliberately that of&#xD;
which she had feared merely the appearance. Doubt&#xD;
yielded to conviction, enforced by' inclination-" Yes,&#xD;
she would go."&#xD;
Poor Eleanor was not, indeed, infallible! But she was&#xD;
little more than "sweet seventeen," and she was in love&#xD;
-when imagination silences reason, and ingenuity puz-&#xD;
zles prudence. Ye pretty ones! pity, bitt do not imitate&#xD;
* her.&#xD;
Having decided, she nerved herself against farther&#xD;
scruples. The cYock struck eleven, and, rising,' she went&#xD;
for the light left in the adjoining room. As she ap-&#xD;
proached the table a strange creaking noise arrested her&#xD;
attention. Surprised, but not frightened, she listened&#xD;
with a quickened sense. It was repeated; it was near;&#xD;
it was in the room in which she stood. The window-&#xD;
sashes were closed. One opened on the afdctle, and she&#xD;
directed her eye to it with a startling suspicion of an at-&#xD;
tempt tQ raise it; but it did not move. Again a sound&#xD;
as of heavy door cautiously turned on its hinges! She&#xD;
looked at the door of the room, but it remained shut.&#xD;
Again the same mysterious sound! Her fear now awak-&#xD;
ened, she looked anxiously around, not knowing from&#xD;
&#xD;
what i~uarter to expect its confirmation, when, her eye&#xD;
resting on the large dark kas~, she perceived, with in-&#xD;
creasing alarm, one of its ponderous doors ajar. Not&#xD;
daring to approach, she bent on it a look of suspicion.&#xD;
It moved, attended by the same sound, now fearfully&#xD;
explained. For, as it continued, slowly opening, inch&#xD;
by inch, while she stirred not, and scarcely breathed, a&#xD;
man's head and body were protruded. She did not&#xD;
shriek. The instinct of self-preservation was stronger&#xD;
than fear; but, putting her hand on the pistol which lay&#xD;
on the table by her side, she raised it and directed it&#xD;
against the intruder.&#xD;
"For the Lord's sake, miss !" exclaimed the voice of&#xD;
the peddler, "'don't fire! I won't hurt a hair of your&#xD;
head. It's only me-only Jed Cooley !"&#xD;
This information did not convey the same assurance&#xD;
to Eleanor that it might to others. His strange reap-&#xD;
pearance Oversetting all the conclusions she had just ar-&#xD;
rived at, while he might be supposed the accredited&#xD;
agent of Walter, the thought instantly occurred to her&#xD;
that his visit by day had only been a stratagem to ascer-&#xD;
tain how best to make a felonious attempt at night.&#xD;
She lowered her weapon, however, but looked at him&#xD;
with all the sternness of which her face was capable, say-&#xD;
ing, resolutely, "How dare you. to conceal yourself here?&#xD;
Begone instantly, or I shall alarm the family."&#xD;
"Why, what a heroine you be I" said he; "but it's&#xD;
not quite rulable though, to shoot a man before you&#xD;
challenge him. Not so much as 'Who goes there?' and&#xD;
pop! I'd like to ha~re been a dead man in no time."&#xD;
"Silence I" said Eleanor, imperatively, "and begone I',&#xD;
"I can't go yet," said Jed, shaking himself very com-&#xD;
posedly, and speaking rather low; "'that consarned place&#xD;
has made me so stiff; all crumpled up for' two hours, that&#xD;
I can't move jest 'at present. flut don't be afeard. I&#xD;

see you are, though you do behave like Judith and&#xD;
Holofernes. I want you to know that I come only as a&#xD;
friend; do jest believe this, and be easy, and let me tell&#xD;
you so'thin' for your own good. So, no offense, I'll set&#xD;
down, but jest as far off as you please; my lame leg&#xD;
is so cramped, bein' crammed like a bundle of rags in&#xD;
that 'ere what y' call it, that I can't stabd."&#xD;
Without permission granted, he seated himself at a&#xD;
respectful distance. Eleanor, upon this, retreating still&#xD;
farther, lie ventured a nearer move; when, mistaking his&#xD;
meaning, she again raised. the pistol.&#xD;
"Hold, miss! not so fast! Unless you put down that&#xD;
'ere popgun of your'n, I shan't speak at all, and that&#xD;
would be your loss, not mine. I only want to come&#xD;
near enough to speak without raisin' the ruff. Now, I&#xD;
tell ~ on the honor of an old Continental, and, if that&#xD;
don't suit you, on the faith of a Christian, that I come&#xD;
for your good, and you'll rue the day if you don't&#xD;
hear me. I'll swear it, if you choose, on that 'ere Bible.&#xD;
It consarns that message I brought you this very&#xD;
n'iornin"'&#xD;
The unmistakable earnestness and frankness of the&#xD;
man, together with this last intimation, inspired her with&#xD;
confidence.&#xD;
"I will hear you," said she; "be quick; but remain&#xD;
where you are."&#xD;
Then, taking a chair herself at what she deemed a&#xD;
safe distance, but still retaining the weapon, she waited&#xD;
forhis communication.&#xD;
Jed east a comical glance from his oblique eye at the&#xD;
pistol.&#xD;
"I guess, miss, you better not play much with that&#xD;
'ere artillery of your'n. It's loaded, you know; and,&#xD;
bein' pointed this way, it rather chokes me. It's like&#xD;
speakin' with a knife at one's throat."&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT TILE PAST.           845&#xD;
&#xD;
Eleanor did not condescend to reply, but, looking&#xD;
grand, waved her hand for him to proceed.&#xD;
"fWell, you see, miss, I'm a little giv'n to do what the&#xD;
sailors call spinning ' a long yarn.' Can't, therefore , be so&#xD;
very quick, as you say, but'll try to accommodate. Now,&#xD;
it a'n't that I would stand about helping' a young lady&#xD;
out of a window, or into a coach, if so be that her sperrit&#xD;
was up t'it, and if 'twas the right man. But this 'ere,&#xD;
maybe putting' the saddle on the wrong horse, I can't&#xD;
no way agree to."&#xD;
Eleanor looked in wonder and indignation.&#xD;
"What do you mean?" said she, angrily. "What&#xD;
has this impertinence to do with your message to&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"ConsiderajMe," replied he, with a significant nod;&#xD;
"con.sid-er-able, I tell you !" Then, speaking earnestly,&#xD;
"Now, do,. do, my pretty young miss, let me go on in my&#xD;
own way. If I'm minding' my manners all the time,&#xD;
you'll never get to the eend. And, to begin, I must&#xD;
make bold to ax you one question. What kind of a&#xD;
person might you be expecting' to meet at that 'ere place&#xD;
to-morrow night? Any particular one ?" he added, with&#xD;
a smile.&#xD;
The delicacy of Eleanor shrunk from confidence on&#xD;
such a subject with such a person; yet, conscience con-&#xD;
victing her of the very purpose hinted at, however of-&#xD;
fensive it sounded when thus stated, she could not&#xD;
speak, buV sat troubled and confused.&#xD;
"Well, if so be you're backward to tell, I'll describe&#xD;
my gentleman, and you'll see if he's your'n or not."&#xD;
Eleanor still remaining silent, he proceeded.&#xD;
"lie's tall; a fine figure o~f a man; some folks might&#xD;
call him handsome, but I don't; he's hard-favored."&#xD;
"Oh no 1" exclaimed Eleanor, off her guard~ "He&#xD;

Jed smiled; and, as ruthlessly as he' would have de-&#xD;
scribed a deserter, proceeded:&#xD;
"Has a mop of darkish hair."&#xD;
"Full, curling, brown hair," said Eleanor, correcting&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Teeth, white as a dog's."&#xD;
"As ivory," interposed Eleanor.&#xD;
"Dark eyes, sharp as a razor."&#xD;
"Yes, when necessary; at other times soft and kind&#xD;
as those of a child."&#xD;
"Didn't look particular soft or kind on me," said Jed,&#xD;
turning his quid.. "Voice strong and harsh; and then,&#xD;
ag'in, a kind of a low growl."&#xD;
"Oh no, no; his voice is music itself! You've no ear !"&#xD;
"No ear !" This was touching Jed on a tender point.&#xD;
"No earl that's good! Why, there a'n't no tune I can't&#xD;
whistle. and sing a'ter once hearing' on't. No ear! I&#xD;
*guess! Well, no matter for that; does this picter' suit&#xD;
you, miss? Ts this the right one&#xD;
Jed's. re se~qnemem~ had been so general, and, so quali-&#xD;
fied by Eleanor's involuntary amendments and construc-&#xD;
tions, that they could not be said directly to oppose the&#xD;
image in her mind, if they did not perfectly conform to it.&#xD;
But she hesitated ; she could not yet bring herself to an&#xD;
open admission' of the expectation insinuated by Jed.&#xD;
"One thing I forgot,". continued Jed "his age.&#xD;
When he makes 'himself up to please 'a young lady, I&#xD;
won't undertake to 'say what he may pass for. Bt'tr&#xD;
havin' no particular reason to tickle my eye, he jest look-&#xD;
ed his rale man; and if he's a day, he is fifty."&#xD;
"Fifty! Oh, dreadful !2' exclaini~d Eleanor. "Nev-&#xD;

"No, I'm not dreamingn' ; I won't say but other folks&#xD;
may be. Pray, then, miss, how old' do you rally ex-&#xD;

&#xD;
"The person," said Eleanor, hesitating-" the person&#xD;
I thought-I supposed-you might mean, is not more&#xD;
than three or four and twenty."&#xD;
Jed opened his eyes and gave a long, low whistle.&#xD;
"Con-star-na-tion !" he exclaime~l; "well, we've miss-&#xD;
ed a figure, but there's time to set it right yet. Now, an~&#xD;
other thing: you didn't hear nothing' about a carriage at&#xD;
a sartin place,' did you? and, to speak right out, you&#xD;
'didn't agree to be run away with, did you ?"&#xD;
"Good Heaven !" cried. Eleanor, scarcely repressing&#xD;
a scream. "What do you mean? What is all this?&#xD;
Who are you? and what horrible man are you' speak-&#xD;
ing of?"&#xD;
"Then you hadn't no nOtion of this ?" asked Jed.&#xD;
"No, no, no! how dare you think it? I would rather&#xD;
die. Leave me this moment! You are a bad man,&#xD;
league with some one still worse to entrap me. Go,&#xD;
go, I command you I"&#xD;
"Don't be so hasty, my dear young lady; though I&#xD;
can't blame you, for all. Jest hear me. I see into it.&#xD;
Jest as I partly expected afore, 'Tis all a plot of that&#xD;
villain. I mistrusted him. soon as I see him the second&#xD;
time. Now jest be quiet and hear me, and I'll make it&#xD;
clear as print to you.~~&#xD;
Yielding to his hearty manner, and her own earnest&#xD;
desire to fathom the matter, if possible, Eleanor consent-&#xD;
ed. His account satisfied her of his honesty, and that,&#xD;
but for him, her imprudent confidence would have be-&#xD;
trayed her into a very unpleasant, if not dangerous ad~&#xD;
venture. But the question still returned, who was this&#xD;
daring and impertinent man? Captain Talbot occurred.&#xD;
to her, but only because, at the moment, she could think&#xD;
of ho one else. The idea was rejected almost as soon as&#xD;
conceived; for, besides that he was gone, and that he&#xD;
was in manners and conduct above suspicion, he was far&#xD;

&#xD;
too worldly-wise thus to commit himself After revolv-&#xD;
ing in her mind every other acquaintance, a certain ec-&#xD;
centric, rich old bachelor.-.-.Baltus Quitman by name-&#xD;
a visitor at Rosenberg, who had furnished merriment to&#xD;
herself and the family by his violent admiration 6f her,&#xD;
appeared the least improbable. Jed's description was&#xD;
not inapplicable, except that he had exaggerated his age.&#xD;
She recollected, tooJ her grandfather's saying, "Take&#xD;
care, Kelly! Baltus has been a wild do~ in his day.&#xD;
He'll run off with you, if he can get you in no other&#xD;
way; for our Dutch blood, when it does stir, stops for&#xD;
nothing~ It makes pirates, buccaneers, patriots, or lov-&#xD;
ers, as the case may be." The suspicion gained con~&#xD;
formation as she dwelt on it. "Yes, it must be so!&#xD;
that wild, half-crazy Quitman must be the man. He&#xD;
must have seen the boat land, remained on the watch,&#xD;
and followed in the obscurity of the night and the&#xD;
storm. Those mysterious footsteps! that spectral fig-&#xD;
ure! were all traceable to the same person;" and she al-&#xD;
most forgave his nefarious purpose when thus relieved&#xD;
of her superstitious fears~.&#xD;
"Well, miss," said Jed, watching her anxious face,&#xD;
"have you. thought it out ?"&#xD;
Unwilling to compromise any one without absolute&#xD;
certainty, she replied, "I only know that a base design&#xD;
has been formed against me, and that you have prevent-&#xD;
ed it."&#xD;
She drew her purse from her pocket as she spoke,&#xD;
and, extending it to him, added, "This is a small re-&#xD;
quital, but I shall find a way to increase it if you will&#xD;
give me your address."&#xD;
But Jed, putting it aside with a proud, but good-na4&#xD;
tured smile, said, "Why, now, you don't suppose I'm a&#xD;
goin' to be paid for not bein? a rascal-.you don't!&#xD;
When I was a youngster, my granny used to say, 'Jed,&#xD;
&#xD;
your money always burns in your pocket;' but, land!&#xD;
II guess if I took your'n, 'twoulci burn blue as brimstone.&#xD;
No,. miss; if I've done you a service, I hope it may wipe&#xD;
out some of my shortoomin's to other folks. And now&#xD;
I must be a gem'."&#xD;
Eleanor would not mortify him by farther pressing&#xD;
her bounty, but, with a smile that Jed thought brighter&#xD;
than gold, she said, "You are a good, generous fellow!&#xD;
You must come and see ~my parents that they may&#xD;
thank you too. But how can you get down? and you&#xD;
lame too! and the dog ?"&#xD;
"Oh! that ain't nothing . I've scaled worse things&#xD;
than that 'ere outwork under your window; and if I&#xD;
got up, why, I can get down, you know. As to the&#xD;
dog, he and l's friends, and, if he don't remember it, I've&#xD;
a bone here to put him in mind. But, dogs or no dogs,&#xD;
you see I set myself to do the job the minute he spoke&#xD;
of that ?ere carriage; I smelt a rat then, I tell you."&#xD;
Turning the same comical squint at the pistol, as he&#xD;
saw her putting it cautiously on the table, he said, "You&#xD;
needn't be so dreadful careful about that 'ere. It can't&#xD;
do nothing. "&#xD;
"Nothing! when it is loaded! What do you mean?&#xD;
You were-~--"&#xD;
"Yes, yes," said he, interrupting her quickly, "I&#xD;
know what you're goin' to say. I did seem afeard on't&#xD;
myself; but that was only jest to keep up your sperrits.&#xD;
You see, when I got in here, and found all dark, I did&#xD;
what I always do, struck a light-I always keep a box&#xD;
by me. Whenever I pass the enemies' lines I lookout,&#xD;
I tell you! So the first thing I sees here was this 'ere&#xD;
pistol, ready for action. I hadn't forgot the angry old&#xD;
gentleman I see in the afternoon, nor how he warned mc&#xD;
off the place. And, thinks I, better keep fire-arms out&#xD;
of the way of a wrath man. So I drawled its teeth.&#xD;

any minute you'd a mind to, I hadn't the heart to disap-&#xD;

"I must make bold, miss, to give you a bit of advice.&#xD;
Don't you be goin' outside your bounds here, at no time,&#xD;

Continental, that's the best reward he'll ax; and one&#xD;
thing more-no offense, by no means-but I should like&#xD;
to know how to call you."&#xD;
Eleanor smiled and gave him her name.&#xD;
"It's a kind of a new one to me, would you be so&#xD;
good as to write it in this here pocket-book for me&#xD;
She did so, with the address of her parents, saying, as&#xD;
she returned it, "you are a great traveler, and your&#xD;
next expedition must be to that place. I am sure,"&#xD;
continued she with warmth, £L that you are an honest&#xD;
man; I shall never forget you; and in some better way&#xD;
I hope to show my gratitude."&#xD;
With a profound bow, and "I thank you heartily,&#xD;
misS," Jed made his exit, and, slipping down from the&#xD;
corner of the af.dalc, his stealthy tread was heard by&#xD;
Eleanor as he wound round the house. Brag approach-&#xD;
ed to challenge, but a hand and a mutton-bone met him.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
TILE next evening, at the appointed time, Jed took up&#xD;
his line of march to the place of rendezvous with his&#xD;
unknown employer. It may be questioned why, haVing&#xD;
broken his engagement in the spirit, he should keep it to&#xD;
the letter, exposing himself to a collision with an angry&#xD;
man. Butfear was not in Jed's vocabulary, and he had&#xD;
two motiveS for keeping his appointment. First, to as-&#xD;
certain if, perchance~ he might discover the farther plans&#xD;
of the gentleman, ~~-next,' to enjoy his present dis-&#xD;
comfiture.&#xD;
Striking along the fence which enclosed the grounds&#xD;
of Rosenberg, he crossed a road, and struck into a dense&#xD;
wood, where he soon encountered the' person he expect-&#xD;
ed to find, wrapped, as usual, and his face sheltered un-&#xD;
der a deeply-impending hat.&#xD;
"You are just in time," said he, approvingly.&#xD;
"Yes; I always calculate to be about right."&#xD;
"Have you seen any one ?" he asked.&#xD;
"Not a livin' cre'ter; and it's so light outside of~thi~&#xD;
'ere wood, that you might pick up pins, so "1 couldn't&#xD;
miss seem' on 'em. Pleasant night, isn't it ?"&#xD;
The gentleman did not respond. It seemed that his&#xD;
own thoughts were sufficient for him, and he walked to&#xD;
and fro, without encouraging conversation. But this did&#xD;
not suit Jed's taste, and he was resolved, if he could, not&#xD;
draw him out, he would talk at' him.&#xD;
'"A rale pretty night it is! I do believe I could read&#xD;
printing' as well as by daylight; bu~ that's not sayin'&#xD;
much, for I've rather neglected 'my education. Some-&#xD;

&#xD;
how, though, such nights make me feel queer-'"super-&#xD;
stitious-like; don't you. feel shaky?"&#xD;
"Well, folks is different. Now, it seems to me, when&#xD;
all creation is so still and clear, as if nothing' couldn't be&#xD;
hid. As if every wicked thing men was a doin' must&#xD;
sartin be seen. So, if I was a goin' to rob, or murder, or&#xD;
do any thing unlawful, I couldn't never do it such a&#xD;
night as. this. I should want a thund'rin' noise about&#xD;
me, winds blowia' like mad, trees a erackin', and clouds&#xD;
a driftin', as if witches was ridin' on 'em. No beautiful&#xD;
shining' moonlight like this 'ere 1"&#xD;
"I thought your had been a soldier," said the gentle&#xD;
man, coolly..&#xD;
"Guess I have! 'Seen. hot service too; but there's&#xD;
harder things than cannon balls, I tell you! A man&#xD;
can face~ them;. when a little trip-hammer inside of him&#xD;
will knock him flat."&#xD;
"My friend,'7 said the gentleman, with a dash of sar-&#xD;
casni in. his manner, "you. have been a Methodist preach-&#xD;
er, I perceive, and probably much greater at a field-&#xD;
preaching th&amp;amp;a in any other field; bu~ I'll dispense with&#xD;
your exhortations at present. By the way; you told me&#xD;
your name, but not your residence. Where do you&#xD;
live?"&#xD;
Jed, nettled at the insinuation of Methodism, and not&#xD;
forgetting how close the gentleman. had been of his own&#xD;
name, answered, dryly, "Why, all about. At this pres-&#xD;
ent time II live here."&#xD;
"Yes; but when you are at home, where do you&#xD;
live?"&#xD;
"Ohs then I live tAere."&#xD;
The stranger hesitated a moment, as if uncertain&#xD;
whether it were best to resent or to be 'amused at the&#xD;
evasion; he chose the latter.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You are a queer fellow," said he, and resumed his&#xD;
walk of observation, while Jed seated himself on the&#xD;
trunk of a large tree that had been felled bard by. A&#xD;
flood of moonlight poured in through the opening,&#xD;
thus throwing the wood and the stranger into a deeper&#xD;
gloom.&#xD;
'KAy," thought Jed, "there h~ tramps back and forth,&#xD;
for all the world like a wicked sperrit. Darkness suits&#xD;
him better than light. The villainous old wolf! to&#xD;
think of his devourin' that pretty lamb! There he goes,&#xD;
a prowling' round, like Satan tryin' to coax Eve out of&#xD;
the guarding "&#xD;
While Jed thus communed with himself his com-&#xD;
panion kept up his walk. At length he stopped, and,&#xD;
in a voice indicative of growing impatience, said, "'Tis&#xD;
long past the time; what can detain her ?"&#xD;
"Perhaps she's forgot," suggested VIed, with provok-&#xD;
ing indifference, and rapping a careless tattoo with his&#xD;
staff on the log on which he sat.&#xD;
The gentleman, either disdaining, or unable to reply,&#xD;
suffered the offensive suggestion to pass.&#xD;
At this moment approaching steps were heard.&#xD;
"She comes!" said he, in a whisper; Jed only 'whistled.&#xD;
The sounds passed away.&#xD;
~' Might a know'd," said Jed, "that wasn't her; only&#xD;
folks on the road goin' to the ferry. When she' doe.s&#xD;
come! I guess we sha'n't hear nothing. "&#xD;
"Not hear! Why not?"&#xD;
"Oh, I'd'n'know," replied Jed, again rapping on the&#xD;
log; "only her steps fall like a feather."&#xD;
"Don't keep up that infernal rapping; of course we&#xD;
can't hear while you do."&#xD;
Jed ceased.&#xD;
"Always willing' to accommodate;" then, appearing to&#xD;
listen, added, "If she does not come-~--"&#xD;

<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7727-00000179"/>&#xD;
354          WALTE1~ THQRNLEY; OR,&#xD;
"Not come !" interrupted the gentleman, angrily;&#xD;
"why~shou1d she not come?"&#xD;
"How can I tell? Maybe she will, maybe she won't:&#xD;
women ain't never to be depended on-that's my expe-&#xD;
r'ence. But I was goin' to say, if she does not come,&#xD;
why then what next?"&#xD;
Bait Jed. was disappointed; the gentleman was in no&#xD;
mood to form or to disclose farther plans. On the con-&#xD;
trary, he said, impatient of Jed's nonchalance, "You&#xD;
are much at your ease, I think.'1&#xD;
"Sartin-why not? I'm not doin' nothing' I'm ashamed&#xD;
of; be you?"&#xD;
The gentleman was perplexed; he did not quite com-&#xD;
prehend his coadjutor; but he had trusted too far to re~&#xD;
cede, and he suppressed an angry reply. Taking out&#xD;
his watch, and coming still more into the light, his face&#xD;
was clearly discernible with its dark and stormy expres-&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
"'Tis nearly ten," he* said, fixing his eyes on Jed,&#xD;
who returned the glance without flinching, but, at the&#xD;
same time, rose and faced him witif rather an air of de-&#xD;
fiance.&#xD;
"'Tis nearly ten," he again said, after some deliber-&#xD;
ation, "and yet she does not come."&#xD;
"No, that's pretty sartin; and, I've an idee that she&#xD;
won't~"&#xD;
The manner, more than the words, brought things to&#xD;
an issue. In a voice that trembled with passion, the&#xD;
stranger burst forth:&#xD;
"I trusted to your word, but more to my money. I&#xD;
suspect you have broken the one, though you pocketed&#xD;
the other."&#xD;
"You do I" said Jed, with a mocking, leisurely em-&#xD;
phasis that, while it confirmed hi~ suspicions, roused the&#xD;
gentleman to fury.&#xD;

&#xD;
Regardless of consequences, he elevated his cane and&#xD;
aimed a blow which, had it fallen as intended, would&#xD;
have told on Jed's pate; but he, perfectly cool, with a&#xD;
twirl of his stout bludgeon twisted the cane out of the&#xD;
hand of his antagonist, and, catching it in its descent a&#xD;
few paces from him, stood master ~f both weapons, while&#xD;
the stranger, in impotent rage, shook his fist, and vent-&#xD;
ed in imprecations what he had no means to enforce&#xD;
more effectually. When he paused, as if for breath, Jed&#xD;
spoke:&#xD;
"Now, I guess, you've done, and I'll have a word.&#xD;
First, you'll please to lam that no man lays a cane on&#xD;
Jed Cooley; and, next, Ii have to tell you that, if 1 served&#xD;
you right, I'd fling your money in your face. But I&#xD;
won't, though. II 'amned it honestly, doin' your arr'nd:&#xD;
I can't afford to work for nothing' and find myself. But&#xD;
you'll please to remember that, as soon as I see your&#xD;
cloven foot, I didn't touch no more of your silver. So&#xD;
much for myself; and__"&#xD;
The g~tleman was about to speak, but Jed cut in im-&#xD;
periously:&#xD;
"Stop! I a'n't done yet. And how, sir, you'll take&#xD;
notice, &amp;amp;4e-i&amp;amp;---.-not-a comm'; not to-night nor never!&#xD;
She's found you out, and so you'd best strike your tents&#xD;
and march away, and I'll furnish the music." So say-&#xD;
ing, he broke, with' a clear whistle, into the "Rogue's&#xD;
March."&#xD;
The rage of the disappointed and insulted man may&#xD;
be imagined. In sentences incoherent from passion, he&#xD;
applied to Jed epithets which, perhaps, relieved himself&#xD;
but no way ruffled his imperturbable foe, who, well sat-&#xD;
isfied to have a clear understanding with him, felt, as he&#xD;
would have said, "very fine."&#xD;
Raising the cane he had secured, and giving it an im-&#xD;
iuilse that carried it into the depths of the wood, he said,&#xD;

you can do without it. You won't have nothing' to do&#xD;
to-morrow; no young ladies to smuggle into carriages&#xD;

Revolutionary doggerel-&#xD;
"Says General Lee to General Howe,&#xD;
What do you think of the Yankees now 1"'&#xD;
he passed into the road, and was soon out of sight.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Eleanor, at this juncture, in which her&#xD;
own fate .might have been involved, reflected, in the se-&#xD;
curity of her room, on her escape.&#xD;
Of the actual world she knew little. She had seen it&#xD;
chiefly ~s reflected in the mirror of fiction, and natural-&#xD;
ly reasoned from this to her own case. While she had&#xD;
no alarm for the future, believing herself safe in observ-&#xD;
ing the caution given her, she dwelt upon the danger to&#xD;
which she had been exposed.&#xD;
"Yes," thought she, "who can tell what might have&#xD;
befallen me? In the power of a wicked man, who, by&#xD;
working on my fears or my compassion, or by alarms&#xD;
for my reputation, might have frightened or forced me&#xD;
into a marriage! Just so did that insinuating Sir Clem-&#xD;
ent attempt to carry off Evelina; and just so, and worse,~&#xD;
did that hateful Bellamy compel poor Eugenia to marry&#xD;
him." But in proportion as imagination pictured her&#xD;
danger, her better sense and her conscience represented&#xD;
her own folly; the' solo cause of it. This once admitted,&#xD;
she was too honest to deceive herself. Reverting to the&#xD;
meeting with Walter, she recalled, with confusion, her&#xD;
undisguised pleasure-an excitement that inevitably had&#xD;
betrayed a sentiment she was bound to repress, and her&#xD;
consequent failure of filial duty. She reflected that&#xD;
Walter must himself have condemned the weakness,&#xD;
pardonable in a child, 'but reprehe~sible'at her present&#xD;
&#xD;
'II&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.           357&#xD;
age. Then how had she yielded to, how had she en.&#xD;
courage, feelings thus strongly revived! Alas! alas!&#xD;
how nearly had she been the dupe of her own foolish&#xD;
presumption! "Oh !" thought she, "if we ever meet&#xD;
again, he shall respect me, though he must not love me!"&#xD;
Going to her open window, where the ripple of the&#xD;
rising tide sent up through the still air a faint murmur,&#xD;
as it coquetted with the shore, advancing, receding, yet&#xD;
always gaining, she impatiently wished that affections&#xD;
could be governed by laws as irresistible. But wiser&#xD;
thoughts prevailed, and her mind turned to that "high-&#xD;
er law," that beautiful chain of dependence by which&#xD;
God unites his rational creatures, making the least often&#xD;
the benefactors of the greatest. "Ah !" thought she,&#xD;
"but for that poor lame peddler, where might I have&#xD;
been at this moment?"&#xD;
She closed the window, then fell on her knees con-&#xD;
trite, grateful, and submissive, and rose with new pur-,&#xD;
poses of duty. Thus tranquilized, she sought her pil-&#xD;
low, and a night succeeded not li2ke those of late,&#xD;
"From which the silken sleep was fretted out;"&#xD;
but as if&#xD;
"Angels made&#xD;
A place beside her."&#xD;
From such sweet rest she was roused..in the morning by&#xD;
the gentle voice of her aunt, who entered with letters-&#xD;
one to Eleanor from her mother, authorizing and urging&#xD;
~ return home. The year exacted by her grandfather&#xD;
expired, and her parents could no longer live with-&#xD;
out her. This was just what she would have asked, and&#xD;
the delicacy which feared to wound her aunt by a pleas-&#xD;
ure too manifest, was relieved by Miss Lawrence saying,&#xD;
as she held up an open letter she had just read, "iNow,&#xD;
Eleanor, hear mine.~~&#xD;
It was also from Mrs. Meredith-an earnest request&#xD;

that her father and sister would accompany Eleanor, and&#xD;
without delay.. The reason for this dispatchi was, that&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence should consult an eminent English ocu-&#xD;
list, lately arrived, and soon to leave the city. There&#xD;
was, therefore, no time to lose. The case of her father&#xD;
had been mentioned to him, and, considering his vigor&#xD;
and constitution, he had little doubt of a cure.  .-,&#xD;
Eleanor clapped her hands, and Miss Gertrude evi-&#xD;
dently favored the proposition; but the decision, of&#xD;
course, rested with her father. F~or this the ladies must&#xD;
wait till after breakfast, no one ever venturing to bring&#xD;
any matter before him till that meal had prepared- the&#xD;
way.&#xD;
The morning was beautiful, the breakfast excellent.&#xD;
He beard, he smiled, he -assented, and straightway the&#xD;
house was astir. First Pomp was sent in hot haste to&#xD;
ascertain when Captain Ostrander would sail; Mr:Law-&#xD;
rence would go with no other; then with orders to se-.&#xD;
cure the entire after-cabin. Then a council was call--&#xD;
ed with Mrs. Dorothy and. Aunt Flore as to certain&#xD;
household arrangements. Then Pomp's wardrobe was&#xD;
to be put in proper .order to attend his master, to his&#xD;
unspeakable pride and delight. As to Mr. Lawrence&#xD;
himself, when asked for his commands, he only answer-&#xD;
ed, "A gentleman is always ready. If my clothes are .&#xD;
good enough for myself, they are good enough for my&#xD;
company."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
PRISCILLA's attendance on Mr. Lawrence had contin-&#xD;
ued with few intermissions since it was first required;&#xD;
for, 'though his displeasure against Eleanor had nearly&#xD;
worn itself out, and Was no longer manifested, he evi-&#xD;
dently found a satisfaction in the quiet little Quaker, and&#xD;
a pleasure in the free appropriation of her time, which&#xD;
he did not choose to relinquish. She came, therefore,&#xD;
as usual, and with the same persistency saw only Mr.&#xD;
Lawrence. Eleanor, at first really wishing to establish&#xD;
a friendly relation with her, had made frequent attempts&#xD;
*to meet and to detain her, but in vain. A quiet "fare-&#xD;
well" was all she could obtain; till, half vexed at what&#xD;
she considered an ungracious return to her advances, she&#xD;
gave the matter up.&#xD;
The morning after the decision in favor of the New&#xD;
York visit, Mr. Lawrence returned from a ride to inspect&#xD;
some work he had in hand with a ruffled look, that in-&#xD;
dicated either that it had not prospered, or that some-&#xD;
thing else was wrong. |Going to his own room, he gave&#xD;
orders that when Prisilla came no one should disturb&#xD;
him.&#xD;
.On entering, he found Philip awaiting his return for&#xD;
directions in regard to improvements to be made in his&#xD;
grandfather's absence. The business settled, he stood&#xD;
looking from a window commanding the walk by which&#xD;
Priscilla would approach. It was not long before she&#xD;
appeared.&#xD;
"Your reader is coming, sir," said he.&#xD;
"Very well; then you may go."&#xD;
There was nothing in the words, but they were accom-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7727-00000182"/>&#xD;
3~Q          WALTER TI1ORNI~EY  OR,&#xD;
panied by a look and emphasis that gave them signill-&#xD;
canoe, and Philip was seized with a temptation that had&#xD;
more than once beset him-a desire to hear what passed&#xD;
on these occasions.&#xD;
At this moment it was stronger than ever, and the fa-&#xD;
cility with which it might be accomplished rendered it&#xD;
unconquerable. The head of the high, old-fashioned&#xD;
bedstead, surrounded by fi.dl heavy curtains, was near&#xD;
the doot by which the room was entered, and, to guard&#xD;
against a draught, there was a large folding screen reach-&#xD;
ing nearly to the ceiling. This was so placed between&#xD;
the bed and the door as to admit of a person being con-&#xD;
cealed by it from any one entering the room, while the&#xD;
curtains furnished an equal protection from those with-&#xD;
in it.&#xD;
Apparently obeying his grandfather, Philip passed&#xD;
round the screen, opened the door, and, closing it again,&#xD;
slipped noiselessly between the screen and the bed-&#xD;
awaiting, with breathless interest, the interview. The&#xD;
approaching footsteps of Priscilla in the hail would have&#xD;
prevented Mr~ Lawrence detecting that none had passed&#xD;
fro~n. his door, had a suspicion been awakened. But it&#xD;
was not, and the entrance of Priscilla led to their usual&#xD;
occupation.&#xD;
Motioning to a chair near him, "Here is the paper,&#xD;
child," said he; "we will take that first."&#xD;
This being "read and marked~" though pe'~haps not&#xD;
as "inwardly digested" as usual, Priscilla was layii~g it&#xD;
aside, when a paragraph unnoticed before caught he"&#xD;
eye, and she read aloud the heading-.-" A Domesti&#xD;
Tragedy." " Shall I read it?",she asked.&#xD;
Certainly. Go on."&#xD;
It recorded the death of a yoting girl in New York,&#xD;
under circumstances of peculiar interest. She had been&#xD;
addressed by a youth of superior fortune and condition,&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE FAST.            861&#xD;
who had secured her affection; but \his father had for.&#xD;
bidden the marriage in terms so offensive and injurious&#xD;
to her, that self-respect had silenced love, and she had&#xD;
broken off all intercourse with his son. He, in despair,&#xD;
had fallen into intemperate habits, and had met a violent&#xD;
death in a street brawl; at which she, struck to the&#xD;
heart, and reproaching herself as the causc~, lost her&#xD;
senses and died miserably.&#xD;
Priscilla's voice faltered as she read, and Mr. Law-&#xD;
rence, as. she concluded, said, "Poor girl! I think I know&#xD;
that man; not personally, but by name and character.&#xD;
He was a hard man. 'Tis all true, I am afraid."&#xD;
Priscilla, having often been encouraged by Mr. Law-&#xD;
rence to express her opinion of what was read, ventured&#xD;
to say, "It seemeth to me that of the three she hath the&#xD;
least need of pity; the father the most, for he was the&#xD;
oppressor. She, and he whom she loved, have gone to&#xD;
a more merciful parent. He remaineth alone with his&#xD;
remorse."&#xD;
The solemnity of her voice and words, instead of rous-&#xD;
ing a spirit of contradiction, affected him.&#xD;
"Very true, child; very true. But don't you think&#xD;
she, too, had some cause for remorse&#xD;
'VNay, not remorse; perhaps for regret, on account of&#xD;
human weakness, inasmuch as it may be that* she had&#xD;
spoken unadvisedly with her lips, and had given place&#xD;
to wrath. If so, it was the word, not the deed, of which&#xD;
she had need to repent, for is it not manifest there re-&#xD;
mained nothing else for her to do ?"&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence was silent, but after a long look into&#xD;
her face, which was calmly and fearlessly turned toward&#xD;
him, he replied, by asking, emphatically, "What would&#xD;
you have done? You do not speak. I will tell you.&#xD;
You, a cool, discreet, wise little Quaker as you are, would&#xD;
have taken; the bit between your teeth if you had been&#xD;

&#xD;
thus used, and would have married the son in spite of&#xD;
his father; and, as it turned out, III must say, have done&#xD;
rightly."&#xD;
Priscilla's color rose, her lips moved, as if to speak,&#xD;
but she was silent. After a moment's pause, she shook&#xD;
her head, and repeated, "Rightly! Men often judge&#xD;
righteous judgmefft in the case of others. But right or&#xD;
not, so I would not have done."&#xD;
Then proceeding, with a kindling eye but a firm tone,&#xD;
she said, "I am one in humble condition, without any&#xD;
of this world's riches. I could bring no dowry but an&#xD;
honest name. But, though I render not worship to&#xD;
titles, nor to rank, nor to great estate, I would enter no&#xD;
man's. family unbidden and unwelcome. I ought not&#xD;
to esteem him higher for the things that perish; nei-&#xD;
ther may I, by a mean action, sink lower than heaven&#xD;
hath placed me. I have not been taught to take the&#xD;
height of others as the rule by whi~h to measure myself&#xD;
or my duty."&#xD;
Her manner seemed to have a magnetic influence on&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence. Accustomed, as he had been, to implicit&#xD;
obedience-unfortunate for himself as for others-impa-&#xD;
tient of the least contrariety, even in opinion, yet when&#xD;
she presumed to utter a displeasing truth, she acted on&#xD;
him as a sedative. He could as soon have directed a&#xD;
burst of anger against a statue, as against her impassive&#xD;
calmness.&#xD;
He looked at her fixedly, as if endeavoring to read&#xD;
her thoughts.&#xD;
"Priscilla," said he, at length, "you know a person by&#xD;
the name of Joel Parkinson."&#xD;
* "He has been a lover of yours."&#xD;
"He ~has sought me in marriage."&#xD;
"And you have refused him, though he appears an&#xD;
eligible connection."&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
1.&#xD;
&#xD;
"My heart did not incline to him."&#xD;
"He is an industrious, respectable young man; well-&#xD;
looking, and well-behaved."&#xD;
"I do not deny it."&#xD;
"He will, to be sure, have to work pretty 'hard a few&#xD;
years, and you would be obliged to make exertions&#xD;
greater than~ in your father's house; but, he will be a&#xD;
prosperous man; he has all the necessary qualifications~?'&#xD;
"I doubt it not."&#xD;
"Priscilla, you have been much in my family; were&#xD;
born under my roof; your mother was an excellent&#xD;
woman; you have conducted yourself well, and have&#xD;
~rendered me kind and willing service, so that I feel in-&#xD;
terested in your welfare. If you will consent to marry&#xD;
,this young man, who seems truly attached to you, II will&#xD;
befriend him in the way of business, and. your marriage&#xD;
portion shall be five hundred dollars."&#xD;
Priscilla's face betrayed that she was moved. She&#xD;
did not attempt to speak for a moment, then, in a clear&#xD;
voice, but not without effort, she said, "Thou art too&#xD;
generous! I thank thee. May God be good unto thee,&#xD;
as thou hast been to me and mine! Th~it I may not&#xD;
profit by thine offer. I do not love the man."&#xD;
"Love begets love," persisted Mr. Lawrence. "Be.&#xD;
sides, prudence as well as affection is to be considered&#xD;
in these things. It is' safer for you, Priscilla," continued&#xD;
he, with an earnest look, "far safer to have the protec-&#xD;
tion of a husband. You ~tre young and handsome.&#xD;
Some one may regard you with a love not as honest as&#xD;
poor Joel's. Be wise in time."&#xD;
Her blushing cheek showed that she felt, as well as&#xD;
understood the insinuation ; but she'&#xD;
"Answer'd nothing, saire with her brown eyes."&#xD;
Her evident distress affected Mr. Lawrence, and, in a&#xD;
tone grave, but not stern, he proceeded:&#xD;

"Priscilla! Joel tells me that he fears you love anoth~&#xD;
er-that you are a~nbitious. If this be so, hear me.&#xD;
Tile to whom you have raised your hopes can not marry&#xD;
you. He ftiay love you-.--our affections are often not&#xD;
in our own keeping; but sorrow, if nothing worse, can&#xD;
only attend such an attachment. I wish to shield you&#xD;
from all harm, and see you. the happy and respectable&#xD;
wife of ~ honest man."&#xD;
Like ajll strong natures, which, when they do yield,&#xD;
pour the selves forth without reserve1 Priscilla's burst&#xD;
through its accustomed restraint. She sat, for a mo-.&#xD;
inent, with hands 'olasped,'with an upoast look, as if ask-&#xD;
ing direction, and then, suddenly turning to~ Mr. Law-&#xD;
rence, she exclaimed, "Thou shalt know all! Thou art&#xD;
merciful and 'just. I have loved thy grandson! but,&#xD;
were he now to offer me marriage, I should reject it.&#xD;
I do not ask thy forgiveness. I have never, even in&#xD;
thought, sinned against thee; but I do entreat that thou&#xD;
wilt trust me, for thine own peace, as well as for my&#xD;
honor."&#xD;
Her face beaming with expression,, her kands pressed&#xD;
convulsively to her breast, her voice full of power, her&#xD;
earnest words, altogether so touched Mr. Lawrence, that&#xD;
he ~could only gaze on her with pity and admiration!&#xD;
Whexi, as if dropped from the clouds or sprung from the&#xD;
earth.-so n~isde~s and. sudden his appearance-Philip&#xD;
was kneeling before him!&#xD;
"Hear me, sir !" he exclaimed. "She has not told you&#xD;
all. Oh,' let me do her the justice she has not rendered&#xD;
to herself!"&#xD;
But the anger that Priscilla had disarmed now found&#xD;
an object.' The fluid, innoxious to her, burst upon Phil-&#xD;
ip's devoted head.&#xD;
"~Rise, sir," said Mr. Lawrence. "Dos not farther dis-&#xD;
grace yourself by adding to the deceptions already prae~&#xD;

ticed upon me. I am not the blind, easy man, under&#xD;
whose very roof you have hoped to carry out your de-&#xD;
signs. I do not blame this wnfoi~tunate girl; her affec-&#xD;
tion has made her a mere instrument in your hands."&#xD;
Rising from his supplant attitude, his face flushed,&#xD;
and trembling with emotion, Philip exclaimed, "I should&#xD;
be unworthy of your blood if I could hear such language&#xD;
unmoved. Listen to me, sir; I do not now ask it as a&#xD;
favor; I claim it as a right. I do not deserve the im-&#xD;
putation you east on me. I did not practice on you, as&#xD;
you suppose1 by the introduction of Priscilla into your&#xD;
house. It was your own act. So far from being done&#xD;
to further our, intercourse, we have never, met till this&#xD;
moment under this roof since the day she came at your&#xD;
own request."&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence looked at Priscilla, who, at Philip's ap-&#xD;
pearance, had retr&amp;amp;ited, and now* sat, pale as marble,&#xD;
like one stunned, in the first chair into which she could&#xD;
drop.&#xD;
"Is this true ?" asked Mr. Lt~,wrence.&#xD;
She bowed her head, and scarcely articulated, "It is.?'&#xD;
"I must and will speak farther," continued Philip,'&#xD;
with passionate earnestness. "We were allowed to grow&#xD;
up together from children without counsel or check-&#xD;
with no guard but the angel who has watched over her&#xD;
innocence. Look at her~ sir? Is it strange that I should&#xD;
love her? I solemnly declare that, if I have been pre-&#xD;
served from the vices and follies of other young men,&#xD;
you owe it to that girl-to her image in my heart, and&#xD;
her influence on my mind. Yet was I coward and Jase&#xD;
enough to dread your displeasure more than her injury&#xD;
.-to seek to obtain unworthily what I dared not ask&#xD;
honorably. But she cast me from her, as I deserved;&#xD;
and, when I offered reparation for the insult, she would&#xD;
not hear me; she would condescend to no clandestine&#xD;

proceeding. I was denied even the privilege of seeing&#xD;
or speaking to her. Then it was that, in a moment of&#xD;
desperation, I tried to carry out your wishes in regard to&#xD;
my cousin. You know the result. This moment de-&#xD;
cides my future: I conceal nothing. I regret to disap-&#xD;
point and displease you, sir: you have a right to every&#xD;
thing but my honor. By that, as strongly as by my&#xD;
love, I am bound to Priscilla. I shall seek to be restored&#xD;
to 'her affection. If I succeed, disinherited and beggar-&#xD;
ed, I shall marry her."&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence listened without an attempt to inter-&#xD;
rupt him, his strong, expressive face betraying the va-&#xD;
rious emotions by which he was agitated; but, as Philip&#xD;
ceased, he broke forth,&#xD;
"By Heaven, you shall do no such thing! No! As&#xD;
the heir of my name and fortune, you shall bestow both&#xD;
on. a gin, who has earned them so nobly. Come hither,&#xD;
Priscilla 1"&#xD;
Philip, animated with newly-awakened hopes, darted&#xD;
forward and led ~er to his grandfather, who, seating her&#xD;
by' his. side, and laying his hand gently on her head,&#xD;
said, "I see it all,, my child--your temptations and your&#xD;
re.~istanoe, your triaJs and your strength. If there is&#xD;
Name, it attaches to those older than yourself, who&#xD;
should have foreseen~onsequenees.' You have suffered.&#xD;

hands, while his voice changed. "Now go; 'you can&#xD;
not speak freely here, and I am better alone at pres-&#xD;

extended it to Priscilla, she pressed it to her lips and&#xD;
heart, but utterance she had none; then, yielding to Phil..&#xD;
ip, who tenderly drew her arm within his own, they left&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence sat a few moments, his head resting on&#xD;
his hand; then, rising and walking to the window, he&#xD;
said, "Yes! there they go; thank Heaven, I have at&#xD;
least made them happy I My pride and passion have for&#xD;
once yielded. Would that they bad oftener done so 1"&#xD;
Then, pacing his room for some time, he said, "Well,&#xD;
we are strange creatures! My fondest and, apparently,&#xD;
wisest plans for that boy have been thwarted; my&#xD;
pride, in the tenderest point, wounded; my hopes of a&#xD;
posterity, of blood as good and honorable as my own,&#xD;
disappointed. Instead of a race as gentle as that from&#xD;
which I descend, there will be an infusion of little&#xD;
'broad-brims,' and 'the iLawnence' will 'quarter' with&#xD;
'the Dale.' And yet I am happier than I have been&#xD;
these twenty years I"&#xD;
As may be inferred, Priscilla was not inexorable; and&#xD;
Philip returned to dinner so radiant,~that Eleanor, who&#xD;
met him at the hall-door, looked at him suspiciously;'&#xD;
and, shading her eyes with her hand, said, "The light&#xD;
of youg face blinds me; I might as well gaze at the&#xD;
sun! What has happened, Cousin Phil ?"&#xD;
Without answering, except by a smile, he drew her&#xD;
aside, and, leading her into the garden, unfolded his fe-&#xD;
licity. He could not have found a more sympathizing&#xD;
auditor. So pleased and excited .was she, that, when&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence entered the dining-room, his face grave,&#xD;
but kind, recovering all her former familiarity with him,&#xD;
she rushed up to him, and, putting her arms round his.&#xD;
neck, exclaimed, ," Dear grandpapa, I must kiss you, for&#xD;

only you to care for."&#xD;
"Oh, never mind me! I'll-"&#xD;
"Take care of yourself I dare say, as Phil has done.&#xD;
Well, it must be confessed that the present generation&#xD;
spare their friends' a deal of trouble, by so readily under-&#xD;
taking the ,charge of themselves. But here's the din-&#xD;
ner. We'll talk farther by-and-by."&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence having desired that no one but those&#xD;
immediately interested should be informed of the occur-&#xD;
rence of the morning till his return, it was understood&#xD;
that he reserved to himself the making it public in his&#xD;
own way.&#xD;
The next morning, at the usual hour Priscilla appear-&#xD;
ed; but, instead of being conducted to Mr. Lawrence,&#xD;
was taken to Miss Gertrude's room, where an affection-&#xD;
ate grc~eting awaited her.&#xD;
Eleanor gazed on her with surprise and admiration.&#xD;
"What a resurrection I" she thought. "That face is&#xD;
now really alive, which, if I had not heard of Pygma-&#xD;
lion and his statue, I should have doubted that it could&#xD;
inspire 'love. A real, live tear trembles in those beauti-&#xD;
ful eyes, and that mantling color betrays that she is ac-&#xD;
tually flesh and blood! She speaks! she smiles! And&#xD;
Aunt Gertrude too! I have never seen her so moved.&#xD;
Can it be &amp;amp;nly sympathy? while she kisses her, she&#xD;
turus away and weeps! Dear me! I am sure I could&#xD;
do sci too!"&#xD;
"My dear child !" said Miss Lawrence, "how happy&#xD;
I am to secure you! I now understand what has ap-&#xD;
pe~red estraiig~nient, and I admir~~ yott all the more for&#xD;
it I shall never, again distrust your love."*&#xD;
"Distrust !" replied Priscilla; "w&#xD;
ground thou weakest on !"      by, I love the very&#xD;
"And me," said Eleanor; "have you no love for me,&#xD;
too, Priscilla ?"&#xD;

A FEET? AT THE FAST.&#xD;
"Thee! oh, doubt it not. Yesterday IL felt as if my&#xD;
heart were dead; to-day I love every body !"&#xD;
"And you will never be jealous of me again ?"&#xD;
"Nay, Eleanor, not so. I was not jealous of thee; I&#xD;
did not sin against thee by an evil thought; I was only&#xD;
jealous of m~se1f. There was a narrow path before me,&#xD;
and I was inwardly admonished to walk therein. I did&#xD;
not dare to see any one who would call up thoughts for-&#xD;
bidden&#xD;
"Well, a wider and a pleasanter path is opening to&#xD;
you now, dear Priscilla."&#xD;
"Yes, truly, my borders are enlarged," she replied,&#xD;
but in a manner which, though grave, was so simple and&#xD;
childlike, that Eleanor could not suppress a smile; and&#xD;
Priscilla, now in a mood to respond to every pleasurable&#xD;
emotion, involuntarily returned it; at the same time say.-&#xD;
ing, "Thou laughest, Eleanor, and, perhaps, at me, for I&#xD;
know that my 'dress and address' are often strange unto&#xD;
thee. But, now th~t I am happy, I will prove to thee&#xD;
that there is a real girl's heart under these; and that, if&#xD;
I can not be acceptable to thee by what godly William&#xD;
Penn calleth the 'trims and ~ la modeness of dress,' I will&#xD;
try to be so by a cheerful spirit."&#xD;
"I believe you," said Eleanor; "henceforth we are&#xD;
friends."&#xD;
The time of the New York visit was now dose at&#xD;
hand, the sailing-day appointed, and every thing in&#xD;
readiness except the vessel, which was detained two days.&#xD;
longer, her cargo being not all in.&#xD;
This term expired; then at eight o'clock on the fQl-&#xD;
lowing inornin~ she would certainly be under way, and&#xD;
a troop of little darkies were on the lookout to see her&#xD;
emerge from the cove which formed her harbor. The&#xD;
horses were harnessed; ready to be attached to the car-&#xD;
riage; the baskets, with provisions 'for the voyage, the&#xD;

presents of various nice articles of domestic mariufac-&#xD;
ture - hams, tongues, sweetmeats, cakes, etc., designed&#xD;
for Mrs. Meredith-and the luggage, were all collected&#xD;
in front of the house, to be transported, at a moment's&#xD;
notice, to the dock at the bottom of the hill; but still&#xD;
no sloop appeared. After two hours of tedious expecta-&#xD;
tion, they ascertained that the vessel could not get over&#xD;
the bar before the tide rose, at the close of the day.&#xD;
- There was nothing but resignation to discomforts,. which&#xD;
then were the common accompaniments of traveling;&#xD;
and people who had never known the advantage\~&#xD;
starting at a prescribed time, and of being able to say, to&#xD;
a minute, when they should or ought to arrive at a given&#xD;
place, submitted with a grace that now can hardly be&#xD;
conceived of. Even Mr. Lawrence, who certainly had&#xD;
not the virtue of patience, never imagined he had the&#xD;
right to complain because Captain Ostrander did, not&#xD;
better calculate the time necessary to take in his lad-&#xD;
ing, the water his vessel would draw, or the time the tide&#xD;
would serve. On the contrary, when the sloop actually&#xD;
appeared, bending toward the shore, and they were really&#xD;
in the carriage, followed by a baggage-wagon, and every&#xD;
living creature on the premises, black and white, he even&#xD;
congratulated himself on his good fortune in getting off&#xD;
after three appointments made and broken!&#xD;
Yet there were in those days enjoyments such as no&#xD;
steam-boats nor railroads can supply. Traveling was&#xD;
then something more than the "transmutation of a man&#xD;
into a living parcel"-one "who,, for the time, has part-&#xD;
ed with the nobler characteristics of his humanity for&#xD;
the sake of a planetary power of locomotion." lie&#xD;
"sees nothing-he admires nothing." He would not&#xD;
were he passing "by rail" through the Yale of Cash-&#xD;
mere! "All he asks is, 'carry him safely, dismiss him&#xD;
soon.A" He ~can not be deceived by a promise of pleas-&#xD;

ure." No, that is past, together with much that we can&#xD;
not regret. ~&#xD;
But still, does not a cherished recollection cling to the&#xD;
old time, when forty miles in a private carriage, with&#xD;
sleek, well-fed horses, was a full day's journey; varied&#xD;
and beautified by hill and dale, the road winding by&#xD;
pleasant streams, through long-drawn vistas of shady&#xD;
trees, through cooling brooks, refreshing the warm and&#xD;
thirsty animals, regarded much as fellow-travelers? Its&#xD;
termination, too, had a pleasure of its own; the expect-&#xD;
ant inn, and at the door the well-known landlord, who&#xD;
had grown old beneath the shadow of his sign. Per-&#xD;
haps he was a justice of the peace, or a militia colonel,&#xD;
or a substantial Dutch burgher; for in those days, in&#xD;
New England at least, such was the responsibility of&#xD;
an "inuholder," that a man was seldom licensed whose&#xD;
character was n~t a guarantee to the public. And&#xD;
then, too, "didn't he know the carriage as far as he could&#xD;
see it ?" and didn't he, with alacrity, hasten to open the&#xD;
door, and to let down the steps for Mr. A., or Mr. B., or&#xD;
Mrs. C., ushering them, not into rooms glittering with&#xD;
mirrors, and filled with dirty damask-no one knowing&#xD;
and no one caring who they might be-but into a cozy&#xD;
little room, plain but comfortable, where a quiet meal,&#xD;
not eaten against time, was served to them, instead of a&#xD;
seat at a long, desolate table, permanently arranged for&#xD;
the throng who at certain hours assemble at it Then&#xD;
at night, not a canopy bedstead, resplendent with gilding&#xD;
and mirrors, and curtained with silk, suggestive of the&#xD;
pleasant reflection that, tliough numbers have reposed&#xD;
beneath it, soap and water come not near it-but a bed&#xD;
which, if inelegant, was, at least, not too fine to be clean.&#xD;
No; this is past. Now roads are rails, horses are iron&#xD;

.CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
LEAVING Eleanor at home, it is time to follow Walter&#xD;
to Ashton; where, having accomplished the business in-&#xD;
trusted to-him, he sought again to lose himself in the ,in-&#xD;
tricacies of the law, but not with the same success. The&#xD;
sentiment which he had flattered himself the convictions&#xD;
of his reason had controlled, if not subdued, asserted it-&#xD;
self with even greater power.. The lovely confiding&#xD;
girl, little more than a child, who had supplied the stron-&#xD;
gest craving of his nature, had grown into the grace and&#xD;
dignity of womanhood, inspiring not alone a tenderness&#xD;
that melted his heart, but 'claiming a homage he could&#xD;
not withhold. He felt himself powerless: He might be&#xD;
silent-he might conceal, but he could not forget. What&#xD;
remained for him but to repeat in substance what the&#xD;
poet has sting:&#xD;
"Why should I indiscreetly tell&#xD;
The name my heart has kept so well?&#xD;
No; let it, shrined within my breast,&#xD;
A little saint forever rest;&#xD;
Forever loved and worship'd there,&#xD;
But never mention'd save in prayer !"&#xD;
It has been 'said that "every one cant do what he&#xD;
should do." While Walter struggled tti prove the truth&#xD;
of this, 'his mind was averted in some degree from per-&#xD;
sonal interests by a long and pleasant letter from Os-&#xD;
car. His previous ones had mentioned his improving&#xD;
health and southern winter. ,All breathed the same ge-&#xD;
nial spirit, the same generous admiration of his friend.&#xD;
In this he spoke of their homeward course. They had&#xD;
arrived at Pittsburg, and should soon be at the Lodge.'&#xD;
&#xD;

3T4          WA.LTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
Much of it was occupied with his mother. He dwelt on&#xD;
her delight in untamed nature. The deep solitudes of&#xD;
the primeval forests through which their "keel-bottom.&#xD;
ed boat," impelled only by the poles of the boatmen, had&#xD;
breasted the strong currents of the Ohio; the picturesque&#xD;
lights and shadows; their nightly encampments in woods&#xD;
strewn with a paradisiacal profusion of flowers, had en-&#xD;
chanted her! The simple preparations for their evening&#xD;
meal, their beds of skins spread on the grass, the Watch-&#xD;
fires during the night-ali was in keeping. "It was,"&#xD;
she said, "the very poetry of life !" '"Even my father,"&#xD;
continued Oscar, "caught the infection of her German&#xD;
enthusiasm. I never saw him so happy as when, with&#xD;
her arm in his, her hand in his grasp, they wandered&#xD;
into the forest while the men were pitching our tents.&#xD;
"This,' he exclaimed,.'is indeed to be free! Here only&#xD;
one may escape from those who presume to legislate for&#xD;
the heart. Here I could be happy, no one to question&#xD;
my motives or to control my actions. But you, There-&#xD;
sa?' 'Any where with yo~i, was her reply. For my.&#xD;
self; I must confess I am not so romantic. No, that is&#xD;
not the word; it is that I have n~t yet quarreled with&#xD;
the world; that I believe it might bestow a felicity which&#xD;
the whole Northwest could not furnish."&#xD;
This letter was followed by one of a very different de-&#xD;
scription. Their journey had terminated most sadly!&#xD;
At Shippensburg, in Pennsylvania, one of the last towns&#xD;
on this side of the Tuscarora Mountains, Mrs. Middleton&#xD;
had been seized with an inflammatory disease, which had&#xD;
terminated her life in a week. Walter was deeply&#xD;
touched. He had seen her at the most impressible age.&#xD;
A lovely and gentle woman, she had first made him&#xD;
sensible of that sweet influence of sex which animates&#xD;
the pure sentiment of the son to his mother, of the&#xD;
brother to his sister, long before the heart believes in a&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.           3Th&#xD;
&#xD;
stronger passion. His subsequent intercourse with Os.&#xD;
car had deepened this first impression, for lie w~s the&#xD;
reflection of herself. To him his ready sympathy was&#xD;
offered. "But who," thought he, "can speak comfort&#xD;
to Mr. Middleton? alike unapproachable as inconsol-&#xD;
able."&#xD;
Some days afterward, having returned rather early&#xD;
from the office, he followed the hum of Damie's little&#xD;
wheel to the outside of the door, where, for greater cool-&#xD;
ness, she had placed it on the clean-swept gravel-path,&#xD;
~and, having found a seat on the step, he fell into a kind-&#xD;
ly chat with her. This gradually ceasing, he mechan-&#xD;
ically followed her movements with~his eye, as in the&#xD;
days of his childhood, while his thoughts, perhaps, were&#xD;
far away.&#xD;
At length he said, "Damie, you look like one of the&#xD;
Fates."&#xD;
"Who be they, Walter ?"&#xD;
"Three old ladies, who watch when we are born, spin&#xD;
the thread of our lives, and then cut them short."&#xD;
"Marcy on me! Why, now, you don't mean for to&#xD;
say, Walter, that I would be so wicked as to kill any&#xD;
body, do you?"&#xD;
"No, no," replied he, laughing, and endeavoring to&#xD;
adapt the fable, but not very successfully, to her prosaic&#xD;
mind.&#xD;
"Well," said she, "I don't call that very profitable&#xD;
spinning , any how-always a cutting' off the thread into&#xD;
all sorts of lengths. Just a waste! couldn't make warp&#xD;
nor filling' on't.".&#xD;
Walter smiled, and she went on. "I 'spose I don't&#xD;
quite see into it. Never mind, I'll turn my labor to bet-&#xD;
ter account. But hark 1"&#xD;
Here a military air, in a clear whistle, attracted their&#xD;
attention,&#xD;

376          WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
CC 'Tis Jed come home ag'in. The cre'ter has been gone&#xD;
on one of his long tramps. Yes, there he is jest turning'&#xD;
the corner."&#xD;
In a few minutes Jed was with them, and, having re-&#xD;
ceived a 'hearty shake of the hand from each, and taken&#xD;
the chair that Walter brought for him, he began, as usu-&#xD;
al, with his experiences.&#xD;
"Well, if I'm not tired to-day, nobody never was,&#xD;
that's sartin."&#xD;
"When did you get home ?" asked Damie~&#xD;
"About noon, I guess; and, you see, Damie, I can't no&#xD;
how live without you.".&#xD;
A. laugh, the only return that Jed's gallantry ever&#xD;
asked or received, was accorded.&#xD;
"Well, now, I know you're burning' for news, and I'll&#xD;
not disappoint you this time. I guess I've larn'd so'thin'&#xD;
now, if I never did afore."&#xD;
Jed's air of self-importance was no small provocative&#xD;
of IDamie's curiosity, and, while Walter, in complaisance,&#xD;
seemed to listen, she suspended the motion of her wheel,&#xD;
and gave him her undivided attention.&#xD;
"Well, ~o begin, for you 'know I love to do things&#xD;
reg'lar-I larnt that in the army-I thought I'd strike&#xD;
across the country,' and go clear to the river, this time.&#xD;
I hadn't been there lately, and I was' a thinking' that the&#xD;
quality out there must want fixin' up. Well, I did so,&#xD;
and, after trading' pretty successful, I come to a great old&#xD;
place I'd often heard tell of; but somehow I hadn't never&#xD;
been to, and, thinking it wasn't obleegin' not to accom-&#xD;
modate them too, I thought I'd stop now. But, Pamie,"&#xD;
continued he; with a look meant to concentrate all her&#xD;
capacity for wonder 'and curiosity, "you haven't no idee&#xD;
of what all come out of this! You're as far from it as&#xD;
one of them' 'er~ chicl~ens, pecking' round there. Oh, the&#xD;
queer things in this world! Rascals lyin' in wait, old&#xD;

gentlemen a storming , niggers a yelling , dogs a barking ,&#xD;
blankets a shaking , young ladies a fainting , pistols a p'int-&#xD;
in', and Old Jed to bear all !" he concluded, with much&#xD;
the same self-glorification as that with which "Old&#xD;
Jack" lamented the oblivion of "Manhood, good man-&#xD;
hood !"&#xD;
"But, Jiamie," he resumed, "to see her pretty face!&#xD;
to hear her say she wouldn't never forget me! why, I&#xD;
tell you, I'd a faced a battery; I'd ~a stormed a redoubt,&#xD;
if I kno'd there was a mine under it; I'd a blowed my-&#xD;
self to atoms afore I'd a deserted her; I'd__"&#xD;
"What under the canopy are you running' on so&#xD;
about, Jed ?" exclaimed the astonished Damie; "who&#xD;
are you talking' about?"&#xD;
"Why, who should It be but that pretty cre'ter, Miss&#xD;
Ellenny-Ellenny; I can't jest hit the name, but she&#xD;
writ it here in my pocket-book~" producing it as he&#xD;
spoke.&#xD;
Walter, who had but imperfectly attended to Jed's&#xD;
narration, suspecting that he would sometimes, perhaps&#xD;
unconsciously, "embroider" a little, caught that name,&#xD;
which, however marred, his heart could not but trans-&#xD;
late; and, seizing the extended pocket-book, read on&#xD;
the coarse and soiled leaf what he considered should&#xD;
only be inscribed on an imperishable tablet.&#xD;
An involuntary ,exclamation escaped him, to which&#xD;
Jed responded by a look of acute and eager inquiry,&#xD;
saying, "Why, sartin, you can't know nothing' about&#xD;
her?"*&#xD;
Walter attempted an explanation that should avert&#xD;
the curiosity excited; but he could better have parried&#xD;
eyes and ears polite than Jed's or Damie's who both,&#xD;
full of real interest, and unrestrained by forms and pro-&#xD;
prieties, pressed the when, and where, and how, till they&#xD;
had extracted the fact that she was the individual young&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7727-00000191"/>&#xD;
WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
lady, the "one scholar that Walter had been sent for&#xD;
to teach." What inference they farther drew they pru-&#xD;
dently withheld from Walter, who now, in his turn, de-&#xD;
manded an account of the circumstances to which Jed&#xD;
had alluded.&#xD;
In silence he listened, but the strong emotions which&#xD;
the detail excited-surprise, alarm, indignation.-were&#xD;
sufficiently intelligible. At length, starting up with un-&#xD;
controllable agitation, he gave vent to his feelings in&#xD;
such vehement language that Damie laid her hafid im-&#xD;
ploringly on his shoulder. It recalled him sufficiently&#xD;
for a rigid cross-examination of Jed.&#xD;
"And what security is there for the future?" he con-&#xD;
tinued; "why may he not renew the attempt?"&#xD;
" Didn't I see to that ?" replied Jed, with a knowing&#xD;
wink. "Didn't I stay hanging' about for days? No-&#xD;
body mistrusted me; peddlers' work's like women's~&#xD;
never done; and then, you know, my leg got desper't&#xD;
bad"-another wink-~--" and I couldn't travel no how.&#xD;
And the women, they'd give me a ixieal or a night's&#xD;
lodging for some little notion out of my pack. All this&#xD;
time, you know, I was spyin' round a'ter that 'ere sar-&#xD;
pent, but couldn't see hide nor hoof of him~ Well, a'ter&#xD;
I had pretty much gi'n him up, I goes, one day, by the&#xD;
old place-r~yther shy, though, 'cause I didn't care to&#xD;
have anotherr time on't with the old gentleman; and&#xD;
what should I see but the grand family.coach, tip-top, I&#xD;
can tell you, going down the road! I followed on to the&#xD;
dock, and there I see that same young lady go aboard&#xD;
of a sloop jest setting sail for New York; s~ all's safe&#xD;
now.~'&#xD;
This was a relief-I~leanor was with her parents. As-&#xD;
sured~on this point, he expressed his earnest gratitude to&#xD;
Jed, and left him and t~amie to compare their ~own views&#xD;
of the matter.&#xD;

* As he retreated Jed turned his quid and said, "Da-&#xD;

"Jed !" replied she in. the same tone.&#xD;
"I say, Damie, can't you see as far into a mill-stone as&#xD;
IL can?"&#xD;
"I guess I can, Jed."&#xD;
"Didn't you mark how he acted when IL repeated&#xD;
them 'ere verses&#xD;
"Be sure!"&#xD;
"And when she was a describin' the man she was ex-&#xD;

"Sartin."&#xD;
"And didn't you notice what a frustration he was in?&#xD;
Now you know that, naturally, he's rather still."&#xD;
"~hyes! Isee."&#xD;
"And then how he thanked me, as if IL. had done him&#xD;
the greatest sarvi~ of the two."&#xD;
"Be sure I"&#xD;
Here Jed gave his long, low whistle, which always,&#xD;
with him, signified unspeakable things. T~ien, with a&#xD;
comprehensive "Well!" he rose, adding, "I must go&#xD;
now, Damie; but if Walter wants any message carried,&#xD;
or any service done-you understand? I'm ready, if it's&#xD;
a hundred miles off; jest tell him so, will you?"&#xD;
Walter had strayed off to recover himself unobserved.&#xD;
He was vexed to have betrayed so much feeling. It&#xD;
was exposing Eleanor to vulgar gossip; it was laying&#xD;
open a corner of his heart never yet disclosed but to&#xD;
Heaven. This feeling yielded to the still stronger one&#xD;
excited by the danger of Eleanor; to the desire to. dis-&#xD;
cover and punish the contriver. But he was here more&#xD;
at fault than she had been; for, though he had no diffi-&#xD;
culty in .believing that an artful and desperate man&#xD;
might have been tempted to the outrage by such a prize,&#xD;
and that it was obvious that the villain, having seen&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
Th~ the morning, Walter went to his usual labors:&#xD;
but the pages that he had heretofore patiently explored,&#xD;
because that, however dry or obscure, he believed them,&#xD;
like the books of the magician, to contain the secret of&#xD;
life and fortune, now failed to. interest him. The hours&#xD;
wore away wearily, and he was glad that the business&#xD;
of the office permitted him to leave it earlier than usual.&#xD;
But he could not go home. He longed not for the&#xD;
human voice, but for the murmur of waters, the whis-&#xD;
pers of the breeze, the hum of insects, and the sweet,&#xD;
tranquilizing sounds of summer.&#xD;
Taking a course over the hills, after a long walk, he&#xD;
found himself at his favorite ~pot-the height that over-&#xD;
looked the fall; and, throwing himself on the sward,&#xD;
he reclined on a little grassy mound that had billowed&#xD;
his head when a boy. There had been a heavy rain for&#xD;
many hours, and, though it had ceased, and&#xD;
"The great sun&#xD;
Looked with an eye of love through the golden&#xD;
Vapors around him,"&#xD;
the weather was not settled. ]~t had cleared, but the&#xD;
wind had, in country phrase, "gone round the wrong&#xD;
way." Still, every object was dipped in beauty. Ex-&#xD;
halations,&#xD;
"Their fleecy skirts painted with gold,"&#xD;
hung, like a gorgeous drapery, round the setting sun.&#xD;
The passing zephyr* shook from the leaves a shower of&#xD;
diamond sparks. The fairy-draught still waited, in the&#xD;

"With rich inlay,&#xD;
'Broider'd the ground;&#xD;
and the river, with a fuller current, sent forth a deeper&#xD;
tone, as it fell and rushed along.&#xD;
Walter did not want to think. He had no pleasant&#xD;
subject of reflection. He 'asked only to repose on "the&#xD;
lap of earth," as unconscious as the weed that sprung&#xD;
from it.&#xD;
For some time he thus lay, calmed by the quiet influ-&#xD;
ences of the place into an unmindfulness of any distinct&#xD;
thing, and reckless of the damp earth on which lie cast&#xD;
himself. A rustling in the branches near him caused&#xD;
him to turn, and he beheld a face, the impression of&#xD;
which tune only deepened on his tenacious memory.&#xD;
Starting up, and rejecting the han&amp;amp; extended to him,&#xD;
he met the eyes of the ~stranger with a fixed and indig-&#xD;
nant gaze.&#xD;
"Do you not know me ?" he asked, in a gentle tone.&#xD;
"Too well," was Walter's quick reply.&#xD;
"Then why refuse the salutation, which, as your best&#xD;
friend, I have a right to claim 1"&#xD;
Walter smiled contemptuously.&#xD;
"I know you only as one who insists on rights, but&#xD;
performs no duties; who makes promises only to break&#xD;
them; who~ having left me to dependence, would frus-&#xD;
trate my honest efforts to support myself; who shrouds&#xD;
himself in mystery to escape me, and, like an assassin,&#xD;
stabs in the dark."&#xD;
The smile that had dressed the face of the stranger re-&#xD;
mained unchanged, as if listening to the idle reproaches&#xD;
of a child.&#xD;
"I have neither time nor disposition to discuss these&#xD;
charges," said he; "we have weightier matters to speak&#xD;
of. Come, Walter," he added, with an insinuating tone,&#xD;
"'tis time that you really know me. I forgive every&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.          383&#xD;
&#xD;
harsh word, every injurious suspicion, however much&#xD;
they have wronged me, in the conviction that I have a&#xD;
perfect justification in my power. But let us find a rest-&#xD;
ing-place, for I have much to say, and every mystery of&#xD;
which you complain shall be cleared up."&#xD;
He had never been so fortunate as to inspire Walter&#xD;
with confidencenor was he more successful now; but&#xD;
the conviction that at least he could no longer deceive&#xD;
him, induced him to listen. Without replying, he ap-&#xD;
proached a little gravelly knoll, and, having seated them-&#xD;
selves; the stranger abruptly asked,&#xD;
"Would you like to go to England?"&#xD;
At a proposition of such import, Walter paused, and&#xD;
then said, "It would depend on the motive assigned for&#xD;
my going."&#xD;
"Suppose it the strongest that could be offered. The&#xD;
restoration to your natural friends; the removal of all&#xD;
concealment in regard to your birth, your past, and your&#xD;
future. Would this induce you ?"&#xD;
"Certainly; but I should require the most. unques-&#xD;
tionable proof that such would be the result."&#xD;
"Undoubtedly. This I will furnish; nay, more, I will&#xD;
myself accompany you."&#xD;
The idea against which Walter had struggled and re-&#xD;
volted-that this person had claims he should find it im-&#xD;
possible to evade-came over him. Yet he felt that this&#xD;
might be the crisis of his fate, that it must not be trifled&#xD;
with. He hesitated, and then said, "18 that necessary?&#xD;
With the proper testimonials, can I not proceed alone ?"&#xD;
A smile, almost contemptuous, was the immediate&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"You little understand in what these credentials con-&#xD;
sist, nor how important I, personally, am to your success.&#xD;
But you must confide in me; you must be advised, nay,&#xD;
governed by me; you will tread unknown ground, and&#xD;

may encounter obstacles you little think of. Without&#xD;
me, your attempt would be futile."&#xD;
Walter shuddered at the close connection that was in-&#xD;
timated; and even were it not such as he feared, to be&#xD;
advised, even controlled by this person, his distrust of&#xD;
whom was nearly invincible, was so repugnant to him&#xD;
that he could not bring himself to utter the required as-&#xD;
sent. At length he said,&#xD;
"I owe every thing to Mr. Grafton. I will take no&#xD;
step without his concurrence. If I am not at liberty to&#xD;
consult him, I decline your proposition entirely."&#xD;
"You are right," replied the stranger, with a readi-&#xD;
ness that looked like truth. "No one can more highly&#xD;
estimate your obligations to Mr. G-rafton than I do. You&#xD;
only anticipate what I meant to say. Consult him by&#xD;
all means. I will not ask of you any thing that he shall&#xD;
not approve. I will see him myself; I ought to do so.&#xD;
I have much, very much, for which to thank him."&#xD;
This answer, prompt and unqualified, and therefore&#xD;
unexpected, had its effect on Walter.&#xD;
"And when is it proposed that I should go ?" he~&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"By the first vessel that sails. I thinkI can rely on&#xD;
one within a week. The precise day I can not now&#xD;
name."&#xD;
"And the testimonials ?"&#xD;
"They shall be yours to-morrc~w. Communicate with&#xD;
Mr. Grafton this evening. Meet me alone at this place&#xD;
to-morrow morning, say at nine o'clock, and all that is&#xD;
necessary to satisfy you shall be placed in your hands."&#xD;
Walter looked as if he would speak farther. He did,&#xD;
indeed, long t&amp;amp;put one question, "Did his parents live?&#xD;
Had he no~ cause to blush for his birth?" But, as if di-&#xD;
vining his thought, or perhaps to test his submission, the&#xD;
stranger said, with significance, "Ask me nothing now.&#xD;
&#xD;
~1&#xD;
&#xD;
'Tis best you should not know in part. The whole will&#xD;
bring explanations that will palliate, if not justify, what-&#xD;
ever is painful. To-morrow you will know all."&#xD;
"All!" thought Walter, with a sinking of the heart&#xD;
at these ambiguous words, that 'made him almost desire&#xD;
to remain in the ignorance which he had hitherto found&#xD;
so hard td bear.&#xD;
"And now," continued the stranger, "I leave you.&#xD;
Give me your hand at parting. You will never refuse&#xD;
it again," he added, with a cordial pressure, and a smile&#xD;
so persuasive that Walter felt, his aversion and doubt&#xD;
melting away.&#xD;
The stranger's quick eye perceived it.&#xD;
"Ah ~" said he, "you are naturally too generous to&#xD;
question so narrowly and harshly the actions of men.&#xD;
Appearances have misled you. You will learn to be&#xD;
more discriminating and more confiding; to pity, in-&#xD;
stead of blaming, those who are condemned to a conduct&#xD;
as foreign to their natures as to yours. Do not deny to&#xD;
yourself the happy privilege of youth-the faculty of&#xD;
believing. The world will disabuse~ you soon enough.&#xD;
Better the fate of him on whose tomb was inscribed&#xD;
'The Deeegved,' than never to trust."&#xD;
What was it that so affected Walter-a tone, a look,&#xD;
a will that, by a sort of mesmerism, subdued him? or&#xD;
the bringing back the recollections of a period when this&#xD;
man seemed his only friend?&#xD;
"Ah! I see," continued he, as if again penetrating the&#xD;
thoughts of Walter; "I see! Think you that I do not&#xD;
remember 'too, when you clung to my. hand, followed&#xD;
my steps, sunk~ to sleep on my bosom! Forgive me,&#xD;
Walter, if I have ever ap.~eared to forget it. And now&#xD;
I must leave you."&#xD;
Walter, with an irrepressible desire to~be satisfied, at&#xD;
least on one point, before they parted, said,&#xD;

"Will you not, as an earnest of farther communica-&#xD;
tions, give me one more assurance---your name? Re-&#xD;
member, that for twenty years I have been denied it."&#xD;
With a smile, much as a. mother would repress the&#xD;
importunity of her child, he replied, "To-morrow! to-&#xD;
morrow !" and, retreating into the thicket whence he&#xD;
C      had emerged, was next seen crossing the bridge; and,&#xD;
having gained the opposite side, with a farewell wave&#xD;
of his hand he disappeared.&#xD;
"What a puppet," thought Walter, "I am in that&#xD;
man's hands! At one moment wrought to fury, and the&#xD;
next held as if in kading-st~rings ~&#xD;
The night was closing darkly around a~ he reached&#xD;
homer and a rising wind in a threatening quarter por-&#xD;
tended a storm. Mr. Grafton congratulated him on&#xD;
finding a shelter before the rain should come, and Da-&#xD;
mie (looked 'inquiringly at his damp clothes and wet&#xD;
feet. "'Tis ridiculous, Walter," said she, with the priv-&#xD;
ilege of affection, "' to be sitting' on the ground a'ter such&#xD;
a rainy spell. Why, the airth is a perfect ma'sh, 'spe-&#xD;

want to be IQoked a'ter just as if you was a boy. You&#xD;
must take some bone-set when you go to bed, or you'll&#xD;
be stiff as a stake in the morning '&#xD;
But Mr. Grafton perceived that Damie's fears and pre-&#xD;
scriptions were lost on Walter; that something occupied&#xD;
him to the entire oblivion of any consideration of com-&#xD;
fort or health; and, getting rid of her as soon as he could,&#xD;
he awaited the communication which he saw was trem-&#xD;
bling on his lip. He had not long to expect it, but, hav-&#xD;
ing heard, he was not so quick to reply.&#xD;
~The idea of parting with Walter for a purpose that&#xD;
might separate them forever, pained him inexpressibly.&#xD;
But this might be borne under different circumstances.&#xD;

own consolation to himself But to place him in the&#xD;
power of that hard man; to surrender his nearly parent-&#xD;
al rights to one who had inspired him only with aver-&#xD;
sion; to place his pure mind, his unspotted character,&#xD;
under an influence which, if it could not corrupt, wouki&#xD;
render him miserable; to have him compromised, 'per-&#xD;
haps, by the companionship of a man whom he had&#xD;
every right to distrust, embarrassed his decision.' lie&#xD;
could only say, while his countenance expressed much&#xD;
more, "Let us see the promised testimonials, Walter, be-&#xD;
fore we farther discuss this matter. Without them it isv.&#xD;
impossible to form an opinion. I shall also see the man&#xD;
himself. I choose to read his~ face as well as his papers."&#xD;
Walter pressed the subject no farther, but the conflict&#xD;
in his mind was but too visible; and, unable to talk of&#xD;
any thing else, he retired, followed by Damie; with her&#xD;
favorite medicament against the effects of cold, the last&#xD;
thing, in his present state of excitement, to be appre-&#xD;
hended. But, though he patiently bore with her re-&#xD;
proofs and directions, he retained no distinct impression&#xD;
of either. The door closed after her, leaving him no&#xD;
other consciousness than that of being alone and quiet;&#xD;
and the draught remained untouched.&#xD;
But to this sleep did not suQceed. The wind, which&#xD;
had risen toward night, with loud threatening of an ap-&#xD;
proaching storm, was now accompanied by a rain that de-&#xD;
scended in torrents. Th~ trees creaked to the blast that&#xD;
whistled through their branches, and the darkness was in-&#xD;
tense. The outer world but too well imaged the tumult&#xD;
and obscurity in his own breast. At one moment, with&#xD;
a passionate eagerness, he longed for the morning, and&#xD;
trembled with a strange delight at the disclosure it was&#xD;
to bring. An indescribable feeling 'possessed him, as&#xD;
of an entrance into a new being-~-a revelation of himself&#xD;
to himself-a sort of bewildering loss of present identity,&#xD;

in the expectation of a new personality. Then he ask..&#xD;

what~old ones to be ruptured ?" With this came visions&#xD;
of Mr.. Graftoa and Eleanor; of the past; of chihIhood~&#xD;
youth, and love. "Oh, heaven! were all these hence-&#xD;
forth to be to him as dreams? and, if so, what was to&#xD;
take their place ?" That face, so impenetrable, was the&#xD;
only answer, and a fearful gulf seemed to open before&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Thus tossed and agitated, the first hours of the night&#xD;
brought him no refreshment. At length he sank into a&#xD;
sleep so heavy as for a time to overpower thought, but&#xD;
from which he started, as people do when under the im-&#xD;
pression of a strong necessity, at an earlier hour than&#xD;
usual.&#xD;
The night had brought as little rest to Mr. Grafton as&#xD;
to himself; and the breakfast was a sad one. When&#xD;
finished, Walter rose, stood as if about to speak, looked&#xD;
irresolute, suddenly seized his guardian's hand, pressed&#xD;
it earnestly, and, rushing from the house, hastened to&#xD;
the place of meeting.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVTh&#xD;
THE rain was over; but, though the wind, had abated,&#xD;
it still returned in fitful and complaining bursts, driving&#xD;
before it dark, broken clouds that saddened the heavens.&#xD;
As Walter approached the ravine he was struck with&#xD;
the ravages of the night. The old sycamore, long since&#xD;
reduced to a fragment of its original size, had been reft&#xD;
of most of its remaining branches, which,. together with&#xD;
young saplings uprooted from their slender hold on the&#xD;
light soil, and portions of rock loosened by the rain,&#xD;
were strewn at the bottom of the fall. The river seem-&#xD;
ed nearly to have doubled its volume, and, as if with a&#xD;
conscious power, tumbled impetuously over every ob-&#xD;
struction, with a deafening noise. A mass of rock, at&#xD;
other times above the surface, was still partially exposed&#xD;
ne~r the base of the fall, though around it innumerable&#xD;
little cascades had been formed by the swelling waters.&#xD;
"How beautiful !" exclaimed Walter, almost forget-&#xD;
ting for a moment his purpose. "If the sun would but&#xD;
shine! I have never seen it so fine."&#xD;
The next moment his attention was diverted to a per-&#xD;
son approaching the opposite bank. It was the stran-&#xD;
ger, who, with long and hasty strides, bent his course to&#xD;
the bridge. Walter's eyes followed his steps, and as they&#xD;
did so he perceived, with a startling shock, that the abut-&#xD;
ment on the opposite side-consisting of portions of rock&#xD;
imbedded in the bank, and bound together by the roots&#xD;
of a tree that had insinuated themselves-had yielded to&#xD;
the pressure of the stream. The most important frag-&#xD;
ment had disappeared entirely, the others looked dis-&#xD;
turbed and loose; and the tree, whose roots had served&#xD;

890          WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
'as binders, hung down, evidently disengaged from the&#xD;
soil, and only slightly adhering among the stones.&#xD;
To raise his hat as a signal, to wave his hand as a&#xD;
warning, to elevate his voice in admonition of the threat-&#xD;
ened danger, was the instinct and work of the moment.&#xD;
But in vain. The nQise of winds and waters' drowned&#xD;
his voice, and his gestures were not understood. The&#xD;
unconscious man continued to advance, and, as he did&#xD;
so, held. something in. his hand which he elevated as&#xD;
if in triumph. Walter, terrified, repeated his warn-.&#xD;
ing, with' every gesture suggested by the necessity; the&#xD;
stranger, blinded by Fate, regarded' them only as to-&#xD;
kens of recognition. Pressing onward, his feet touched&#xD;
the bridge; in an instant his weight was upon it, and&#xD;
the next, a loud crash confirmed Walter's fears. 'Then,&#xD;
for the first time, comprehending the danger, he strove&#xD;
to recover the bank. But no-he only made sure his&#xD;
destruction, lost his balance, and was precipitated on the&#xD;
rocks below, even before the entire fall of the bridge;&#xD;
which, wrenching itself by its weight from the opposite&#xD;
abutment, descended with a tremendous force so near its&#xD;
victim as to appear to crush him.&#xD;
A shriek of horror burst from Walter. Casting a&#xD;
frantic look around, he imploringly called for help, but&#xD;
no voice responded.&#xD;
The stranger lay motionless. Fearless and ag4e,&#xD;
Walter prepared to descend the bank; and though he&#xD;
felt the stones and trees of which he had heretofore often&#xD;
made a ladder yield under him, he reached the bottom&#xD;
in safety, and made his way, though with difficulty 'and&#xD;
danger, to the rocky bed on which the unfortunate man&#xD;
lay. He saw, to his unspeakable distress, that a frag-&#xD;
ment of the bridge ~had fallen across his limbs. There&#xD;
could be no doubt of the effect. What other injuries he&#xD;
had received he endeavored to ascertain by sucli~efforts as&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT ~HE PAST.           891&#xD;
he was, unassisted, capable of. He could only discover&#xD;
that, though life was not extinct, consciousness seemed&#xD;
gone; a faint moan was the only sound uttered.&#xD;
To leave him thus was dreadful! but how otherwise&#xD;
could he obtain the requisite aid? Again he shouted,&#xD;
"Help! help 1" and cast a despairing glance down the&#xD;
ravine. A loud "Halloo 1" answered him, and in a sec-&#xD;
ond he caught a glimpse of a man at the entrance. Re-&#xD;
peating his cries, accompanied&amp;amp; by wavings of hat~ and&#xD;
handkerchief; he succeeded in attracting his attention to&#xD;
himself; and soon, to his inexpressible relief; he discern-&#xD;
ed him to be his friend Jed.&#xD;
The usual path along the river's margin was covered&#xD;
with water, and one less fearless than Jed might have&#xD;
hesitated to adventure up the ravine; but he was not&#xD;
to be deterred, though it was impossible to advance with&#xD;
the rapidity that was required.&#xD;
As he slowly picked his way through water and over&#xD;
rocks, sometimes obliged to. ascend a considerable dis-&#xD;
tance up the shelving bank, Walter watched his ap-&#xD;
proach with feelings more easy to imagine than de-&#xD;
scribe. At his feet lay a human being, a few instants&#xD;
before full of life, thought, projects, powe=r-one toward&#xD;
whom the returning tide of early affection had brought&#xD;
back kinder feelings than he had supposed'he could ever&#xD;
again entertain for him-now a mangled, perhaps a life-&#xD;
less mass! and on this man depended his dearest inter-&#xD;
ests. He held the key of his destiny. He alone could&#xD;
raise a veil now, perhaps, never to be withdrawn, and&#xD;
the future would settle over him as darkly as the past.&#xD;
Nay, more, with a shudder that chilled his very soul, he&#xD;
exclaimed, "And this man was, perhaps, my father!&#xD;
Oh, heaven! am I never to be relieved from this op-&#xD;
pressive mystery ?"&#xD;
With eyes bent on the wretched being before~ him,&#xD;

392          WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
arms crossed on his breast, and emotions that nearly&#xD;
mastered him, he remained, till Jed, with a last leap to&#xD;
the rock, stood beside, him.&#xD;
A glance at the wreck of the bridge, a few words from&#xD;
Walter, and he comprehended the whole. Then, stoop-&#xD;
ing down, he examined the face that was turned from&#xD;
him; but, starting back, with a look of amazement and&#xD;
awe, he exclaimed, "The Lord is just! This is the very&#xD;
indiwidival I told you of! I should know him among a&#xD;
thousand 1"&#xD;
At this assertion, confirmed by still farther examina-&#xD;
tion, the revolting of Walter returned with increased&#xD;
Violence at* the very moment, too, when he desired&#xD;
only to indulge in the new-born confidence inspired&#xD;
by the stranger! The revulsion nearly overcame him.&#xD;
The claims of a common humanity alone enabled him to&#xD;
6xert the necessary selfcontrol.&#xD;
Fortunately, several persons from the lowcr village-.&#xD;
some curious to see the wrecks of the storm, others to&#xD;
ascertain the cause of the loud report on the falling of&#xD;
the bridge-~now appeared on the heights above, or wad-&#xD;
ing~ up the ravine.&#xD;
As soon as the catastrophe was understood, there was&#xD;
no lack of assistance; and Jed, having ingeniously con..&#xD;
tried a hurdle from the branches of trees, suggested the&#xD;
difficult, but only expedient of thus carrying the injured&#xD;
man to the nearest house, or other resting-place, where a&#xD;
physician should be in readiness to attend him.&#xD;
With all dispatch this idea was put in practice; and,&#xD;
carefully and tenderly, the rough men contrived to re-&#xD;
move the timbers, and to raise and place upon this rude&#xD;
litter the poor remains of a body which still gave evi-&#xD;
dence of life by obstructed breathing and loud moans.&#xD;
To bear this burden, by a path difficult for a single per-&#xD;
son; was no easy matter; but what will not human sym-&#xD;

pathy effect? At last it was accomplished. leaving&#xD;
reached a dwelling, near the extremity of the ravine,&#xD;
they there deposited their charge in the hands of a phy-&#xD;
sician, for whom a messenger had been sent.&#xD;
The examination was not long. A ~hort time w~&#xD;
sufficient to decide, from the nature of the injuries, that&#xD;
life could not be preserved. The only relief the case&#xD;
admitted of was that there was no consciousness of suf-&#xD;
fering, and that, even if there were, the conflict must be&#xD;
short. This opinion was soon confirmed. While a few&#xD;
lingered round from, compassion, which, however fruit-&#xD;
less, was not to be repressed, the physician remained to&#xD;
watch the failing pulse; and XValter, possessed with&#xD;
the feeling that to him belonged the sacred offices&#xD;
due by the kindred of the dead, reverently waited to&#xD;
receive the last breath, and to lay his hand on the cbs-&#xD;
ing eyes.&#xD;
Jed, who, after his fashion, putting ' things together,"&#xD;
as he said, had come to the conclusion that "somehow&#xD;
this person was not unbeknown to Walter," and who&#xD;
perceived, moreover, that this knowledge was attended&#xD;
by a ~painful interest, was one of the number who re-&#xD;
mained.&#xD;
The final moment that comes to all was at hand. The&#xD;
physician removed the finger which pressed, in vain, for&#xD;
the answering pulse; listened for the breath that no lon-&#xD;
ger came; felt, inquiringly, for the heart that no longer&#xD;
throbbed; and, in that low tone which all instinctively&#xD;
use in the presence of Death, said, "It is~over !"&#xD;
Notwithstanding his distrust, his indignant sense of&#xD;
wrong, the last charge just brought against him, and the&#xD;
repugnance with which, until very lately, he had shrunk&#xD;
from this strange man, Walter could not hear these words&#xD;
without a pang.&#xD;
"Yes," thought he, "it is over! The last, the only&#xD;

clue to my name and kindred, the only being to whom,&#xD;
for weal or for woe, I seemed to belong; is gone!"&#xD;
Every angry feeling was still. His eyes filled with&#xD;
tears as he contemplated that pale and ghastly face, and&#xD;
repeated the last words of the stranger, "To-morrow!&#xD;
tomorrow 1" .-" how unconscious," continued he, "of&#xD;
their prophetic import !"&#xD;
He was reminded that he was not aloxie, by Jed's&#xD;
saying, as he approached and stood by his side, "Well,&#xD;
he has done what we must all do; he has gi'n in his ac-&#xD;
count !"&#xD;
This solemn truth, though announced in homely&#xD;
phrase, struck to the heart of Walter, and turned his&#xD;
thoughts from his personal interests to the dread con-&#xD;
cerns of the man who lay before him; in comparison&#xD;
with which, all earthly hopes and disappointments faded&#xD;
into insignificance, and he involuntarily uttered a prayer&#xD;
for mercy I&#xD;
Having given the necessary directions, he hastened&#xD;
home to apprise Mr. Grafton of the events of the morn-&#xD;
ing; but the rumor had reached him, and, hurrying to&#xD;
the place, he met Walter at the door, whose countenance&#xD;
confirmed it.&#xD;
While occupied by the considerations now naturally&#xD;
presented, they were interrupted by the entrance of Jed.,&#xD;
He would, perhaps, have dilated on an occurrence so&#xD;
startling, but lie saw that, contrary to his usual practice,&#xD;
the fewest words were best, He, therefore, proceeded&#xD;
promptly to say that, in removing the body, a packet&#xD;
had been found lying under it, from which circumstance&#xD;
it had remained dry and uninjured; that, not knowing&#xD;
what it might contain, or into what hands it might fall,&#xD;
lie had put it immediately into his own pocket, whence&#xD;
lie now took it.&#xD;

them, it can't do no harm to give it to Walter."&#xD;
With an eager hand it was grasped, but, unwilling to&#xD;
expose the intense interest it excited, he laid it on the&#xD;
table. He had just. done so when the landlord of the&#xD;
inn at the lower village entered, bringing a valise, which&#xD;
he said belonged to the gentleman.&#xD;
Here was farther matter for investigation-perhaps&#xD;
more evidence. But, though, in addition to the right ex-&#xD;
ercised on such occasions, in order to ascertain the name&#xD;
and friends of the individual, they felt that they had&#xD;
peculiar claims to the fullest inquiry, this, for obvious rea-&#xD;
sons, could only be made without witnesses. Mr. Graf-&#xD;
ton wa~ therefore cortipelled to disappoint the evident&#xD;
curiosity by saying that he would make the necessary&#xD;
investigations in proper season; and he then quietly re-&#xD;
moved the articles to a place of safety. The prevailing&#xD;
idea that the stranger had been in some way connected&#xD;
with himself or Walter, and the character of Mr. Graf-&#xD;
ton, prevented all complaint.&#xD;
That Mr. Grafton did make such investigation, and&#xD;
that he did find matter of the deepest interest to Walter,&#xD;
is all that is, at present, needful to communicate to the&#xD;
reader. To the village public it was proper to be ex-&#xD;
plicit on one point-the name and condition of the de-&#xD;
ceased. Mr. Grafton, therefore, lost no time in making&#xD;
known that the unfortunate person was proved to be&#xD;
Captain Talbot, an Englishman, having friends in New&#xD;
York, to which place, immediately after the funeral,~ he&#xD;
should himself proceed, in order' to convey the articles&#xD;
in his possession, and to communicate the intelligence&#xD;
of his death.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX Vhf.&#xD;
THE oculist had not disappointed the expectation of&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence and his family. His fine constitution,&#xD;
little impaired except by occasional attacks of gout,&#xD;
and his hopeful temperament, coming in aid of a real-&#xD;
ly skillful oper~6r, the ultimate restoration of the eye&#xD;
was- soon pronounced certain, and a short time, put&#xD;
it in a. condition to be used under some restrictions.&#xD;
This,' together with the assiduities of his children, and&#xD;
the effect of agreeable change, seemed to rejuvenate&#xD;
him. He was pleased with every thing and every body.&#xD;
He forbore to discuss politics with Mr. Meredith, with&#xD;
whom he never agreed; or, if sometimes betrayed into&#xD;
a collision, dropped it voluntarily when it grew too&#xD;
warm; was not vexed when his daughter sympathized&#xD;
more with her husband's views than with his own~ did&#xD;
not consider it a personal injury if Miss Lawrence had&#xD;
a l~eadache, and, to Eleanor's especial satisfaction, re-&#xD;
instated her entirely in his favor. He could even see,&#xD;
without offense; that Oscar Middleton excited in her a&#xD;
very different interest from that which Master Philip&#xD;
had done, though, in his private opinion, the ruddy,&#xD;
handsome face, vigorous frame, and manly air of the lat-&#xD;
ter "'were worth a hundred such pale-visaged slips; 'but&#xD;
if girls would be fools he couldn't help it." -&#xD;
Oscar, indeed, did friterest Eleanor more than he had&#xD;
done heretofore. His tender sadness came. nearer her&#xD;
he~rt than his thoughtless, happy gayety. Formerly&#xD;
she laughed with him, but could forget him; now, with&#xD;
all the sensibility.of her own nature awakened, she was&#xD;
&#xD;
the more strongly drawn, toward him. If he were silent,&#xD;
she became so; if he smiled, she rejoiced; if he were&#xD;
sad, she was only the more thoughtful for him. Her&#xD;
young friends had greeted her return with welcomes and&#xD;
invitations, but she resisted whatever interfered with&#xD;
kind considerations for Oscar. To cheer him when pres-&#xD;
ent, to pity him when absent, became a habit, ~the more&#xD;
confirmed by his reliance on her.&#xD;
The improvement in Miss Lawrence, if not as great as&#xD;
in her father, was more striking, because that, on her first&#xD;
arrival, a more than usual languor and dejection were vis-&#xD;
ible. Years had elapsed since' her last visit to her sis-&#xD;
ter. Many changes had take~i place. Past scenes, of&#xD;
which every heart bears indelible impressions, were re-&#xD;
vived, and she had often cause to reprove herself for not&#xD;
being happier now that the family harmony, the loss of&#xD;
which she had so much deplored, was restored. But the&#xD;
cloud passed, and she, too, was cheerful-grateful for the&#xD;
love bestowed, and especially for the sweet attentions of&#xD;
Eleanor, who, like a ministering spirit, dispensed good&#xD;
to each and to all. Ah! had she found out thus early&#xD;
that the true secret of quieting our own hearts is to&#xD;
cheer others; that secret which some never learn?&#xD;
A fine afternoon and the solicitations of Eleanor had&#xD;
tempted her aunt beyond the limit of her usual walk,&#xD;
and, on their entering the study. by the garden door, she&#xD;
perceived that she looked pale and wearied.&#xD;
"I[ have beei~ a foolish girl," said Eleanor, "but, when&#xD;
I get among those trees, they always cheat me into go-&#xD;
ing too far. Dear aunt, let me arrange a couch for you&#xD;
here. You are too tired to take another step. See I&#xD;
there is the settee on the piazza, and here," said she, fill-&#xD;
ing her arms as she spoke, "are these sofa-cushions;&#xD;
they will make a nice resting-place for yom I'll carry&#xD;
them out, and have it ready in a minute."&#xD;

"No, no, my love; I'll go to my room. Some one&#xD;
may come, and If should not fancy to be thus caught."&#xD;
"Nobody will come; nobody ever does come here&#xD;
now," replied Eleanor, with a sigh. "There will only&#xD;
be the sun to look at you, and he is about taking his&#xD;
rest too; he is so low he can only peep at you through&#xD;
the branches."&#xD;
Miss Lawrence was not one of the resisting order;&#xD;
and, telling Eleanor she always madeL~her do as she&#xD;
pleased, she yielded to the arrangement.&#xD;
The cushions being so placed as to support her, she&#xD;
permitted herself to be disposed of; sitting or recli~iing,&#xD;
as Eleanor fancied, who, hovering about her, delighted&#xD;
herself by contriving, like a playful child, the most be-&#xD;
coining adjustment. The simple white veil, taken from&#xD;
her hat, was so thrown as to shade, and yet add another&#xD;
grace to her face. A shawl of many dyes was cast as a&#xD;
drapery over her; one hand supported her cheek, and&#xD;
the other reposed, as Eleanor said, "beautifully negli.&#xD;
gent" among the flowers they had gathered in their&#xD;
walk, and'whiclh appeared to have fallen from its grasp&#xD;
into her lap.&#xD;
She contemplated her work admiringly. Her aunt&#xD;
laughed.&#xD;
"You h~'ve placed me like a lay figure. Now what&#xD;
do you propose to do with me? You see If can resist&#xD;
none of your vagaries."&#xD;
"Oh, if I could sketch you just as you now are! but&#xD;
I can not. Therefore I shall put you to sleep. Now&#xD;
not another word! but shut your eyes like a good child."&#xD;
A~ if under the spell of her irresistible attendant, Miss&#xD;
Lawrence obeyed; and Eleanor, in a little while, satis-&#xD;
fied that she really slept, stole quietly into the sliudy,&#xD;
and thence into the hall, to prevent any intrusion from&#xD;
that quarter.&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.          399'&#xD;
&#xD;
The sweet air, the perfect quiet, the soft light,&#xD;
"Prolonged the balmy rest."&#xD;
At length a foot crossed the threshold of the garden&#xD;
door, and a gentleman cast an inquiring look within, as if&#xD;
in quest of some one. He entered;, but, finding nobody,&#xD;
ventured to approach the glass door communicating with&#xD;
the piazza. His step was light, like that of one who&#xD;
fears to intrude, and yet who is impelled to advance.&#xD;
As he does so, he passes the door and sees a sleeping&#xD;
lady I Instinctively he retreats; another look, an~ he&#xD;
advances. A thought seems to kindle up his race. ~He&#xD;
proceeds, regardless of proprieties; his lips move, but no&#xD;
sound escapes. His countenance and manner evince&#xD;
surprise, eager interest, and yet timidity. He moves&#xD;
nearer, and still nearer. He pauses; and then, with a&#xD;
noiseless step, he is by the side of the unconscious sleep-&#xD;
er. He, gazes; his soul seems looking from his eyes!&#xD;
One instant, anJ they have detected the fair hand among&#xD;
the flowers; the next he is on his knee, the hand is in.&#xD;
his, and his lip is pressed on a simple gold ring! The&#xD;
action has roused the lady; she wakes to hear "Mary I"&#xD;
uttered in a voice' which, though' silent to her outward&#xD;
ear, has never, through long, long years, ceased to speak&#xD;
to her heart. Speech fails her. Does she still sleep?&#xD;
Does she dream? That face, changed, yet still the same,&#xD;
is it a reality?' Those eyes,&#xD;
"Once so dear~&#xD;
Long, long ago-long ago 1"&#xD;
are they, indeed, bent on her?&#xD;
Another pressure of her hand,, that name, now dis-&#xD;
used, perhaps forgotten by all ,but himself; again utter-&#xD;

had never thought to see again this side of Heaven, and&#xD;

&#xD;
"Yes, Mary," he exclaimed; "I should doubt my&#xD;
own identity if you did not admit it. Could we ever&#xD;
fail to recognize each other ?"&#xD;
Still she looked at him, immovable, wondering~tears&#xD;
filling her asking eyes.&#xD;
"I know what you would say," said he, rising; and,&#xD;
assisting her attempt to do the same, he placed himself&#xD;
by her side. "You would ask why I am here? Here&#xD;
of all places? There is much to tell you, dear Mary,&#xD;
but at another time. Now, I will only say that urgent&#xD;
business brought me to New York. II could not be&#xD;
there, and not see your sister and Mr. Meredith, always&#xD;
my friends. Failing to find him at his office, I came&#xD;
hither; of your being here I had not the remotest&#xD;
thought. In my ignorance of the house I blundered in&#xD;
at the wrong entrance, and was led, not by chance, but&#xD;
by Heaven, to you-never, so help me God!, to be again&#xD;
parted from you !"&#xD;
A cloud overspread her fair brow. A deprecating&#xD;
look-..-a deep sigh, were the only answer.&#xD;
"I understand you. You would say the same obsta-&#xD;
cles exist. They may, but they shall no longer prevail.&#xD;
Mary," continued he, with solemnity, "you love me&#xD;
still. If time, as I sometimes feared, had worn me out&#xD;
of your affection, I would 'he silent. But your look,&#xD;
your manner, this sacred symbol never laid aside, attest&#xD;
your fidelity.&#xD;
She attempted to speak, but he continued earnestly:&#xD;
"Oh, hear me farther. The happiness of our lives&#xD;
has been sacrificed by a weak submission to a false prin-&#xD;
ciple. It shall be so no longer. I will claim you as my&#xD;
wtfe. I ought to have done so when you were first torn&#xD;
~. from me."&#xD;
A loving but weeping face, eyes upturned as if im-&#xD;
ploring strength from above, betrayed the conflict his&#xD;
words had excited.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, that is not all !" she at length said. "If no op-&#xD;
position-there are-other considerations. how can I&#xD;
impose a wreck upon you? upon you, still capable of&#xD;
happiness? 116w can I burden you with the poor re-&#xD;
mains of what, even in its best estate, was not worth the&#xD;
love you lavished on it ? No, no, no; it is wrong, un-&#xD;
generous; I should be humbled to the dust were I to&#xD;
do so."                          (&#xD;
"Mary! Mary 1" said Mr. Grafton, in ~nder but re-&#xD;
proachful tone, "is this the language yo  ould hold to&#xD;
me? Were you, indeed, the wreck you fear, should I&#xD;
not love the ruin I perhaps had caused? And ,has not&#xD;
time done its work on me too? But I will not so wrong&#xD;
true love as to rest it on the outward creature. I conld,&#xD;
indeed, dear Mary, still address to you the words of mere&#xD;
human affection; could tell you that I love you in that&#xD;
sense that satisfies most women; that I had not outlived&#xD;
my youthful passion; that no conceivable happiness could&#xD;
equal the possession of you; that-"&#xD;
"Do not-do not speak so! You deceive yourself.&#xD;
I am nothing-nothing2'&#xD;
"NoI will not; but rather of that union of heart,&#xD;
mind, and soul, that time has only strengthened. To&#xD;
this union I claim the right of setting that seal which&#xD;
God has Himself appointed, not alone for present hap-&#xD;
piness, but as an earnest of that still better union for&#xD;
which it is a preparation. Do not, then, disturb your&#xD;
own mjnd and distress me by considerations unworthy&#xD;
of us both."&#xD;
Her tears flowed faster. Sliac could only say, "You&#xD;
are too good-too good; ~ do not deserve it."&#xD;
He looked at her in silence; then in a tender and ad-&#xD;
miring tone, rather. as if thinking aloud, said, "Still&#xD;
the same! humble, gentle, self-distrusting; still, as in&#xD;
the language of my youtb, 'My lovely Mary I"'&#xD;

What could woman -true, believing woman-..-say?&#xD;
Her heart was on her lips, ready to pour forth all he&#xD;
could ask, but a cruel fear restrained her, and a look&#xD;
of agony overspread her face, as she said, "My father!&#xD;
my promise !"&#xD;
"Bless you, Mary, that you insist on no other obstacle!&#xD;
Your father's objections shall be met with all respect;&#xD;
but, if still immovable-I say it deliberately-I will dis-&#xD;
regard them."&#xD;
"But my promise," she repeated.&#xD;
"I am the last person to make light of it; but we&#xD;
must not let reverence exaggerate itself into superstition.&#xD;
That promise was made under circumstances which de-&#xD;
prived you of free agency. Only a tender, conscientious&#xD;
spirit, like your own, would have held it obligatory to&#xD;
the extent that you have done. We have both been&#xD;
sacrificed to it. Your mother, could she have foreseen&#xD;
its consequences, w6uld never have exacted it; and, if&#xD;
now comprehending what passes here, will rejoice in the&#xD;
breach of it."&#xD;
His calmness restored her own.&#xD;
"Hear me," said she, "for a moment, and then you&#xD;
must leave me. You are not aware that my father is&#xD;
now in this house. I can not permit you to meet him&#xD;
at present. I must have time to reflect. Let me decide&#xD;
as I may, I have need of a strength that now I do not&#xD;
feel. Leave me; you shall hear from me to-morrow."&#xD;
"Do with me as you please. I shall go, but in the&#xD;
confident trust, not alone of hearing from you, but of&#xD;
seeing you, to-morrow."&#xD;
"Go! go 1" said she, earnestly, the dread of her father&#xD;
taking possession of her.&#xD;

WALTER TIIORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIX..&#xD;
Mn. Lawrence, in a happy unconsciousness of what&#xD;
was going on elsewhere, reclined in his chair in the din-&#xD;
ing-room, and near him, at the tea-table, was Mrs. Mere-&#xD;
dith.&#xD;
After an interval of silence, Mr. Lawrence asked the&#xD;
hour-" Tea-time, is it not?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir. Will you take it now, or shalL we wait&#xD;
for Mr. Meredith? He will be here in a few mo~&#xD;
ments."&#xD;
Now, usually; Mr. Lawrence abhorred waiting for any&#xD;
body, but he was not in a mood to be easily ruffled.&#xD;
" Oh no ; wait by all means.,~&#xD;
Another pause.&#xD;
"Where is Eleanor ?" he asked.&#xD;
"Gone to pass the evening with some of her young&#xD;
friends."&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence particularly disliked the absence of any&#xD;
of the family at meals, but now he only said he was glad&#xD;
of it.&#xD;
A servant entered with a note from Mr. Meredith.&#xD;
He was detained in the city; should not; be at home till&#xD;
the next day.&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence could bear this too; for, though he en-&#xD;
tirely respected Mr. Meredith, they were, as the Italians&#xD;
say, not 8ympatic~; and the presence of neither added&#xD;
much to the happiness of the other.&#xD;
"Well, then, we'll have tea, Janet, if you please," said&#xD;
he, and, Mrs. Meredith ringing the bell, Phyllis was di-&#xD;
rected to tell Mis~ Lawrence it was ready.&#xD;
&#xD;
4O5&#xD;
&#xD;
She returned in a few $moments, and, dropping a&#xD;
courtesyy to the old gemtkman, as if deprecating the ef-&#xD;
fect of the answer she brought, said, "Missis not well,&#xD;
massa, and can't come down, she say."&#xD;
This was a sound seldom heard patiently by Mr.&#xD;
Lawrence.&#xD;
"Not well! What's the matter now? She was well&#xD;
enough at dinner."&#xD;
"Dun know, massa. Missis looks berry sick; neber&#xD;
seed missis look so afore."&#xD;
"Do, Janet, go up and see what it is. These creatures&#xD;
always make every thing as bad as they can."&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith did not need the injunction. Hurrying&#xD;
to her sister's room, she found her in a state that, as&#xD;
Phyllis had said, was unusual, and which, knowing no&#xD;
cause for it, she naturally referred to physical indisposi-&#xD;
tion. Miss Lawrence was in bed, with a quickened and&#xD;
irregular pulse, a feverish cheek, and a strange, excited&#xD;
look quite unlike herself. But she spoke calmly, and,&#xD;
not daring then to attempt an ex~danation, only begged&#xD;
to be alone and quiet, and doubted not that she should&#xD;
be wall in the morning.&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith left her, as she requested, but not much&#xD;
assured by what she had said; and Mr. Lawrence, on&#xD;
hearing it, put down his scarce tasted tea, pushed his&#xD;
chair from the table, and, leaning back in it, sighed&#xD;
heavily.&#xD;
His daughter, to relieve him, repeated her sister's&#xD;
words, "She will be better in the morning, sir."&#xD;
"No, she won't he replied, quickly, "nor the next&#xD;
day, nor the next, nor 4ever; never, I tell you !"&#xD;
"Dear papa, even if she should be indisposed for a&#xD;
few days, there can be no cause for uneasiness. We&#xD;

Janet? All the drugs in the Materia Medica can't help&#xD;
her!"&#xD;
"Why, papa 1" expostulated Mrs. Meredith. "There&#xD;
is surely nothing in Gertrude's indisposition to excite&#xD;
alarm."&#xD;
Pshaw, child! I don't suppose she's going to die;&#xD;
perhaps it would be better that she should. She would&#xD;
go to heaven, and I might be made more fit for it. But&#xD;
she won't die; she will live, and sh&amp;amp;will suffer; and so&#xD;
it always is. I never see a little sunshine, Ii never feel&#xD;
happy and cheery, but some cursed thing turns up to&#xD;
contradict me. I am a miserable man-I am."&#xD;
"IDear. papa, don't say so."&#xD;
"I will say so. Here' she has been so well and cheer-&#xD;
ful that, old fool as I am, I thought she would continue&#xD;
so; iha~t, at last, she was happy; and my heart was light-&#xD;

"Oh no, sir; this is some accidental thing-some lit-&#xD;

'"Ay, yes; there it is~ those infernal nerves! Don't I&#xD;

"Nothing mysterious, papa; every body knows what&#xD;
nerves mean."~&#xD;
"The devil 'they do! I wish I did; I only know&#xD;
that they1 mean misery. Oh Lord! I wish I was dead."&#xD;
"My dear father,'~ interposed Mrs. Meredith; but, re-&#xD;
sisting her sympathy, he suddenly exclaimed "Where&#xD;
2$ that fellow?"&#xD;
Mrs. Meredith, perhaps not comprehending, did not&#xD;
speak.&#xD;
"Is he in this country?"&#xD;

"He is living, sir, and in this country-in New En-&#xD;

"Why, then, have I never been able to hear of him?&#xD;
Why have not you, or your husband, by any chance&#xD;
ever spoken of him? Why have I been kept in igno-&#xD;

on her defense.&#xD;
"You must recollect, papa, that his name has been&#xD;
interdicted for years; that every trace of him has been&#xD;
purposely obliterated; even his portrait saved from de.~&#xD;
struction only on the condition of being never seen-"&#xD;
~he might have added1 that the family breach, mainly&#xD;
occasioned by the sympathy of her husband and herself&#xD;
with Mr. Grafton, had prevented all communication; but&#xD;
he checked farther remonstrance by saying, "Well, well,&#xD;
if it was so then, now I want to hear of him-nay, to&#xD;
see him, if it. be possible to get any comfort out of him.&#xD;
Can he not be written to ?"&#xD;
"Certainly; but to what purpose, sir?"&#xD;
"Janet, don't drive me mad! To what purpose?&#xD;
Why to bring him here, and marry him to Gertrude."&#xD;

"My sister would not approve of s~ich a step, I am&#xD;

'~ You must allow, papa, for the feelings of a delicate&#xD;

may naturally fear a change in his sentiments."&#xD;
"Sentiments! Oh, he has nerves too, eh! Of course,&#xD;
sentiments and nerves-they always go together."&#xD;
"f Or, perhaps," continued Mrs. Meredith, "she may&#xD;
fear the effect of time on her appearance."&#xD;

isn't a prettier woman this day in the United States of&#xD;

nection undesirable. In short, sir, I must beg you will&#xD;
not insist on my writing as you propose.~~&#xD;
But Mr. Lawrence, having taken the first great step,&#xD;
le pas qui cAte-having s~y4ificed his pride, his will,&#xD;
his personal resentment-was not a man now to stop.&#xD;
Opposition and doubt only stimulated his determina-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"Very well; if you won't write, Meredith will; and&#xD;
if he won't, Eleanor shall. I will have it done, and that&#xD;
before another day passes. I am old-I must soon die&#xD;
.~4 will not a~ny longer have this man's face forever&#xD;
thrusting itself between me and heaven, nor Gertrude's&#xD;
complaints turning aside my prayers."&#xD;
&#xD;
Ii&#xD;
&#xD;
"Complaints, sir! Surely, my sister never com-&#xD;
plains?"&#xD;
"No, not in words.' But do you think that tc be obey-&#xD;
ed, cherished, honored, as if I had never given her a mo-&#xD;
ment's pain; to be waited on year after year, as if it&#xD;
were not a duty, but a delight; to be b6rne with, how-&#xD;
ever unreasonable; to be Watched when ill, as if her&#xD;
life hung on mine; and to look like an angel with a&#xD;
broken heart! do you think there are, or can be, com-&#xD;
plaints louder than these ?"&#xD;
Alarmed by her father's vehemence and agitation, she&#xD;
directed all her efforts to calm him, and in some degree&#xD;
succeeded. He consented to talk over the matter cool-&#xD;
ly with Mr. Meredith, and above all not to touch on it&#xD;
to his daughter at present.&#xD;
This done, and having induced him 'to retire at an&#xD;
early hour, with her habitual deference to her husband's&#xD;
opinion, she suspended her final judgment till he should&#xD;
return.&#xD;
The breakfast was cheered by a favorable report from&#xD;
Miss Lawrence, and, while still seated at the table, an-&#xD;
other note was brought to Mrs. Meredith from her hus-&#xD;
band. It was, as may be conjectured, to inform her of&#xD;
his meeting with his old friend, Mr. Grafton. Her ex-&#xD;
*       declamation of pleasure and surprise attracted the attention&#xD;
of her father. The explanation was no sooner given&#xD;
than followed by his earnest direction that the gentle-&#xD;
man should be invited to the house without delay.&#xD;
It is enough to say that Mr. Grafton came; that a&#xD;
conference with him and Mr. Lawrence ensued, concili-&#xD;
atory and conclusive; that he was indulged in a long&#xD;
interview with Miss Lawrence, the result of which was&#xD;
K       eloquently inscribed on their happy and serene faces,&#xD;
when they afterward joined the family circle.&#xD;
Oh, Love, when art thou worthiest of our homage?&#xD;

A PEEP AT TIlE PAST.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XL.&#xD;
ELEANOR'S sympathy with her aunt was, as might be&#xD;
expected, full and demonstrative. She could speak of&#xD;
nothing but the happiness that was at last to reward h~er&#xD;
sweet and patient life, and loved to dwell on every thing&#xD;
that could add to it interest or romance. 2&#xD;
"Ah! that ring," said she, ~ne day, to her; "how&#xD;
often I have wondered why you preferred it to every&#xD;
other ornament; and another thing, too," turning to Mr.&#xD;
Grafton, "Why is it that you call my aunt 'Mary?' I&#xD;
suppose there is some secret about that also."&#xD;
"No, Eleanor; none at all. The names of Mary and&#xD;
Gertrude were both given to her-the last more gener-&#xD;
ally used. For this season I preferred the first. It was,&#xD;
perhaps," added he, with a smile, "a lover's fancy-of&#xD;
which you now, I dare say, wonder that I could ever&#xD;
have been capable-but it seemed to make her more my&#xD;
own to address her as few others did. After her moth-&#xD;
er's death, I now understand that your grandfather di-&#xD;
rected that 'Gertru.de,' her name, should be exclusively&#xD;
1'&#xD;
used, and 'Mary' lived only in my memory.&#xD;
Entering thus into her aunt's interests, Eleanor con-&#xD;
ceived the greatest liking for Mr. Grafton. His good-&#xD;
ness, his dignified yet simple manners, his refined yet&#xD;
playful ways, were her constant theme. It is but fair&#xD;
to say that, like every thing in Eleanor, the sentiment&#xD;
was genuine. It had nothing to do with Walter, of&#xD;
whose intimate relations with Mr. Grafton she was still&#xD;
ignorant, that gentleman having reasons to be no farther&#xD;
communicative on that subject than he bad formerly&#xD;

412          WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
been. On the contrary, his manner, when speaking of&#xD;
him, was the only thing she did not like in Mr. Graf-&#xD;
ton.&#xD;
"That was a respectable young man," said Mr. Mere.&#xD;
dith, one day, "whom you were so good as to send to&#xD;
us-Mr. Thornley, I mean. We were quite sorry to part&#xD;
with him. I hope he is likely to do well."&#xD;
"Yes, I think so," said Mr. Grafton, coldly.&#xD;
Eleanor colored and bit her lips.&#xD;
"He was a well-mannered young man too," continued&#xD;
Mr. Meredith; "rather remarkably so, in his condition.&#xD;
Not at all presuming.-appeared to understand his place&#xD;
as well as his business, which is not common in these&#xD;
days. 'I shall always be happy to see him, and to be of&#xD;
use to him."&#xD;
"I am glad he gave you satisfaction," was all the re-&#xD;
ply vouchsafed; and Eleanor, feeling her anger rising&#xD;
against them both, fled out of the room.&#xD;
Walters sudden and never-explained removal from&#xD;
Mr. Meredith's family, together with its obvious effect&#xD;
on him, had been a cause of painful conjecture to Mr.&#xD;
Grafton. When he saw Eleanor; he was confirmed in&#xD;
his suspicion that it was connected with her. It was&#xD;
not easy to believe that he could have remained indif-&#xD;
ferent when placed in such relations to such a girl. He&#xD;
only wondered that her parents had permitted her to be&#xD;
exposed to a similar danger, and if the interest were, in-&#xD;
deed, wholly on his side. She became, therefore, a study&#xD;
to him.&#xD;
In the evening, as he sat by her side, he said, "I have&#xD;
~ot heard your opinion of the teacher I sent you. Did&#xD;
you like him? I mean, of course, only as an instruct-&#xD;
or."&#xD;
Vexed to have her estimate so restricted, she replied,&#xD;
coldly, "Oh yes, very well.'1&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.          413&#xD;
&#xD;
* "Did you take your lessons quite alone, or was a class&#xD;
formed for him?"&#xD;
"A class! What an idea! Share those precious les~&#xD;
sons! What a suggestion !"&#xD;
She .repeated, with an affronted air, "A class! No,&#xD;
indeed !"&#xD;
"It is a good plan, however," said Mr. Grafton. "It&#xD;
furnishes a stimulus and an excitement to what might&#xD;
otherwise be dull."&#xD;
"What a mind it must be," thought she, "that he&#xD;
could not stimulate! What a spirit that could be dull&#xD;
in his presence! 'Tis plain he knows very little of&#xD;
Walter."&#xD;
"But, perhaps," resumed Mr. Grafton, "he did not&#xD;
wish it-I mean, did not think it best for you. You&#xD;
might not have required it; his undivided attention&#xD;
would advance you more rapidly."&#xD;
Still Eleanor did not speak; she dared not. She was&#xD;
irritated. She feared to betray it; and, deceived by her&#xD;
manner, he reflected," Ah, poor Walter! I see the&#xD;
young lady is not pleased; and why? There is but one&#xD;
solution - she Us detected, and resents his presump-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
Her conduct to Oscar Middleton confirmed his suspi-&#xD;
cion. Yet, if she were, indeed, unfriendly to his favor-&#xD;
ite, he could not be unjust to her; and, seeing daily&#xD;
more and more of her attractive qualities, he became&#xD;
still more regretful of the hard fate of Walter.&#xD;
Nearly a fortnight had elapsed since the arrival of Mr.&#xD;
Grafton, when divers family t~tes-c~-t~es might have been&#xD;
observed; Mr. Meredith and Mr. Grafton closeted in the&#xD;
library; Mrs. Meredith with her sister; in her room.&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence and Eleanor-the eldest and the youngest&#xD;
most approximating - whispered, laughed, and took&#xD;
counsel together-he in his arm-chair; she on a low seat&#xD;
at his feet.&#xD;

* "I will have it so," said he. It was uttered impera-&#xD;
tively, but pleasantly.&#xD;
"' 'Tis all nonsense~to put it off! What are they wait-&#xD;
ing for? They are~old enough; ela, Eleanor? Come to&#xD;
years of discretion! Don't you think so, little Nelly?&#xD;
Well enough acquainted, ela ?"&#xD;
"Oh yes, dear grandpapa, you are quite right. Why&#xD;
should people ever wait to be' happy? If mamma can&#xD;
only persuade Aunt Gertrude-"&#xD;
" We'll do it first, and persuade her afterward," said)&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence, with his usual impatience. "I will not&#xD;
hear'of any silly delay. Why, I may die in a week-&#xD;
in a day-and i[ will see it first."&#xD;
Then followed half~whispered suggestions, smiles of&#xD;
intelligence, and exclamations of "All right! that's a&#xD;
good girl! a verjr good girl! You shall be married, too,&#xD;
one of these days."&#xD;
Then, drawing out a well-filled purse, he put it into&#xD;
Eleanor's hand, adding, "Just as you please, Leentje;&#xD;
as much more if you want it." Upon which, kissing&#xD;
him gratefully, she hurried away. ~eting her mother,&#xD;
her eager inquiry was answered by a smile and nod of&#xD;
assent, accompanied by "The very thing! she would&#xD;
never have given a thought to it." Upon which, Elea-&#xD;
nor rang the bell, ordered the carriage, flew down stairs,&#xD;
and, in a few, minutes, was on her way to the city.&#xD;
* A few days' interval, and paper boxes of various sizes&#xD;
were smuggled into the house, aiid into Eleanor's room,&#xD;
where M7rs. Meredith was called on to admire. Many&#xD;
articles were presented for the approval they without ex-&#xD;
ception received. The. most important was reserved for&#xD;
the last~~-~a silk dress, white, and 'yet not white, for, in&#xD;
certain lights,' it gave out a faint shade of exquisite blue,&#xD;
and, over all, ~vas ~ liistrou~ silvery hue.&#xD;

ed Eleanor, deli late " e very color of an angel's&#xD;
wing!"&#xD;
"Ala! my dear child, II fear my acquaintance with an-&#xD;
gels is not so intimate as yours. But it is certainly the&#xD;
very thing for your aunt."&#xD;
One day more, and, in the evening, the drawing-room&#xD;
lustres are lighted. Though there is no bustle, there is&#xD;
arrangement and an air of expectation. In one of the&#xD;
arm-chairs Mr. Lawrence reclines; in the other, a ven~&#xD;
erable.looking person, whose black gown and white&#xD;
bands indicate his office; and on a table near him, be-&#xD;
tween massive silver candlesticks, lies a richly-clasped&#xD;
book. The two gentlemen converse in a subdued tone,&#xD;
and Mr. Meredith, who walks up and down the room,&#xD;
with his hands, as usual, crossed behind his back, occa~&#xD;
sionally looks at his watch.&#xD;
At lengi~h the hail clock i~ hear&amp;amp; to strike eight, and,&#xD;
the door opening, Miss Lawrence, led by Mr. Grafton,&#xD;
enters, attended by Mrs. Meredith and Eleanor, and fol.&#xD;
lowed, at a respectful distance, by the domestics. The&#xD;
clergyman and Mr. Lawrence rise, and the proper dispo&#xD;
sition of all parties made, the book is opened, and those&#xD;
portentous~ words, "We are gathered together here, in&#xD;
the sight of God, and in the face of this company, to join&#xD;
together this man and this woman in holy matrimony"-&#xD;
those words so fraught with happiness or misery-usher&#xD;
in the solemn rite. Circumstances, peculiar to this oc-&#xD;
casion, give it a more than common interest, yet a sweet&#xD;
composure rests on every face. A slight irregularity at&#xD;
the moment of betrothal threatens to disturb it. In-&#xD;
stead of putting on the ring in the usual manner, Mr.&#xD;
Grafton is observed to draw one off, press it to his lips,&#xD;
and then replace it. Some hearts beat quicker, but no&#xD;
agitation interrupts the holy benediction, which now sets&#xD;
its seal to the ceremony.&#xD;

she can not comprehend how others are so quiet! Her&#xD;
aunt presses her tenderly to her breast, but.she smiles.&#xD;
Her father, her mother, Mr. Grafton, all are softened, but&#xD;
all are calm. She turns to her grandfather. He has&#xD;
retreated to his chair; his handkerchief Covers his fade.&#xD;
This she can understand. She runs to him, throws her&#xD;
arms round his neck, and they weep together.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XLI.&#xD;
MR. GRAFTON had kept Walter informed of whatever&#xD;
related to the business that had taken him to the city,&#xD;
together with that which most nearly touched himself.&#xD;
.A letter now received annQunced his marriage, intelli-&#xD;
gence welcome to Walter, but astonishing to Damie, en-&#xD;
tirely unprepared for it.&#xD;
"Married !" she exclaimed; "well, 'of all things! Aft-&#xD;
er staying' here till he fairly grow'd into the airth, to go&#xD;
off and get married! Taken in by some artful slip of a&#xD;
thing, jest fit to be his darter! There's no trusting' a&#xD;
man! They're all alike 1"&#xD;
The letter farther directed Walter to join Mr. Grafton&#xD;
without delay, and this, recalling Damie from her 'pro-&#xD;
visions of the domination of a young wife, and the over~&#xD;
throw of her 'own safer rule, she gave her attention to&#xD;
the necessary preparations. But there was something in&#xD;
Walter's manner that she could not explain, which, to-&#xD;
gether with certain other things she had remarked of&#xD;
late, disturbed her. . At an early hour on the following&#xD;
morning he was off, and, while she and Jed watched the&#xD;
receding wagon, she said, "Jed, II feel uneasy."&#xD;
"I dare say," said he; "~~women most gin'rally do."&#xD;
"No, no; but about Walter."&#xD;
"I don't see no occasion to buy trouble. He looks&#xD;
well enough.'1&#xD;
"Oh, isn'tt that; but he's different. He isn't like oth-&#xD;
er folks."&#xD;
"No, he never was; that's why I always liked him.&#xD;
He is Walter, and he ain't nothing' else. 'Tisn't every&#xD;
one that understands him."&#xD;

&#xD;
This was touching a weak point.&#xD;
if "~ think I'd ought to understand him by this time,&#xD;
any one does. He's naturally quick, has considerable&#xD;
pride, and strong feeling's; but he's lamed to keep 'em&#xD;
tinder, to 'rule his sperrit,' as the Bible says, and to be&#xD;
always jest about so. But lately he's in a parfecf~whirl;&#xD;
never remembers nothing , don't answer no more'n a post,&#xD;
don't read his books, don't do nothing . I tell you, Jed,"&#xD;
she added, in a confidential tone, "I am afraid he's shat.&#xD;
tered ~ I've observed it ever since that awful consamn&#xD;
at the old bridge."&#xD;
4ed laughed outright.&#xD;
"No, no," said he; "that was, be sure, an ugly busi-&#xD;
ness, and bein' some kind of acquaintancemade it worse.&#xD;
But Walter's all right here," tapping his head as he spoke.&#xD;
"And then," continued Damie, little affected by Jed's&#xD;
assurance, "to 'go off and get married! 'tis jest like put-&#xD;
tin' a step-mother o              That'll jest finish&#xD;
~ said' ver the poor lad.&#xD;
Jed, with one of his comical looks, "I&#xD;
respect you, and that's rather more than I can say for&#xD;
all women folks; but you're human natur', Damie, a'ter&#xD;
alL Now don't you go for to make out a despe'rt case&#xD;
on't, 'cause a new mistress is a comm'. I tell you Wal-&#xD;
ter ain't a goin' to lose his wits, nor you to lose your&#xD;
home. Mr. Grafton can't live without you no more'n&#xD;
without a head; and, as to his young wife, she don't&#xD;
know nothing , and you'll rule her jest as you do him.&#xD;
So keep quiet, and if you'll get 'breakfast ready, perhaps&#xD;
I'll take some with you, jest to keep up your sperrits."&#xD;
Walter, alighting at' the stage-house in New York,&#xD;
was met by Mr. Grafton, who immediately transferred&#xD;
him to the carriage of Mr. Middletonin waiting for him,&#xD;
when they proceeded to the residence of that gentleman,&#xD;
where he was informed lie was expected to stay.&#xD;
ci&#xD;
&#xD;
A PJ~EP AT THE PAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
419&#xD;
&#xD;
It was late in the evening when they arrived. Oscar&#xD;
received him with open arms, and saw, in the unusual&#xD;
emotion with which Walter met him, only the natural&#xD;
expression of his sympathy. His father, he said, was&#xD;
not at home, and might be absent a week longer-a cir-&#xD;
cumstance that Walter heard with a sense of relief.&#xD;
Mr. Grafton having left the young men to themselves,&#xD;
they had much of mutual interest to occupy them.&#xD;
A late hour found them still together. Walter took&#xD;
up his candle to retire, but Oscgr resisted.&#xD;
"Why go so soon?" he asked; "let us make a night of&#xD;
it. You once, I know, were a 'slave of the lamp' over&#xD;
your books. Come, be as regardless of sleep for the sake&#xD;
of a friend."&#xD;
Walter replaced his light, and Oscar said, "I have a&#xD;
great deal yet to say. I have not spoken of Mrs. Graf-&#xD;
ton. You will, like her, I am sure, and not wonder at&#xD;
the constancy of your guardian. We young fellows,&#xD;
Walter, are fond of talking of undying love, and all that,&#xD;
but I never expected to see such a living proof of it. I&#xD;
wonder if you or I could be capable of it."&#xD;
"It would depend, I imagine, on the object."&#xD;
"Ah! yes, indeed; and such an object, I can tell you,&#xD;
is not often given, to test a man's fidelity. Why, Wal-&#xD;
ter, she must have been handsomer than even Eleanor&#xD;
Meredith! There is still a strong family likeness, hut I&#xD;
doubt if the niece be equal to what the aunt was. Such&#xD;
regQlar features; and, then, that angelic look! which I&#xD;
never saw on any face but one."&#xD;
Oscar's changing Voice explained~ the allusion. At&#xD;
another time Walter would have replied to it; but now&#xD;
the word~ would not come, and both were silent.&#xD;
At length, with an expression of regret at the absence&#xD;
of his father, Oscar added, "He was called away by the&#xD;
affairs of that wretched man, Talbot, who was a connec-&#xD;
tion of his."&#xD;

~Walter started, but did not speak, and Oscar pro.&#xD;
needed.'&#xD;
"The catastrophe happened, Ii think, in your neigh~.&#xD;
boyhood ~'&#xD;
"Yes~; '~rou knew him personally ?"&#xD;
"Oh yes; I've seen him occasionally from a boy, but&#xD;
I never liked him. Perhaps it was a mere prejudice&#xD;
founded on the fancy of a child. I remember taking it&#xD;
into my head that his visits always made my; father ill,&#xD;
and I conceived a dread of the mere sight him. Later,"&#xD;
continued Oscar, laughing, "I gave him the sobriquet&#xD;
of 'the Wandering Jew,' because he was forever roam.&#xD;
ing about, got money nobody knew how, and never&#xD;
seemed to grow older."&#xD;
This was a subject Walter could not talk of; and both&#xD;
again were silent.&#xD;
Suddenly Oscar exclaimed, "You have no idea how&#xD;
Eleanor has improved since you saw her, in face; per..&#xD;
son, manner, mind. Then she was* a charming girl-&#xD;
now she is a bewitching woman! With all your phi..&#xD;
losophy about her, Walter; which even then I wondered&#xD;
at, you must admire her now 1"&#xD;
Walter did not feel called upon to say how recently&#xD;
he had seen her, nor how entirely he agreed with his&#xD;
friend.&#xD;
"You mistake me," he replied, quietly; "I always&#xD;
did her justice, I think."&#xD;
"Justice! Pshaw! What a word to apply to Ele-~&#xD;
an~r Meredith! So you really brought her up before&#xD;
the inexorable bench of your discriminating mind, tried&#xD;
and found her worthy of approval! You 'second Dan~&#xD;
jel come to judgment!' Why, Waiter, like the knights&#xD;
of old that you and I used to rant about, I shvll be corn-.&#xD;
pelled to defy you to mortal combat if you do not ac-&#xD;
knowledge her peerless charn~s in warmer terms."&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
A ?EE~PAT TI{E PAST.          421&#xD;
"And by the same right?" inquired Walter, smiling.&#xD;
Oscar's heightened color betrayed more than his&#xD;
words.&#xD;
I' iNfo," he replied ;~ "no, not her avowed champion&#xD;
and adorer."&#xD;
"Her silent one ?" asked Walter, rather uneasily. It&#xD;
was a topic on which he could not well banter.&#xD;
Oscar hesitated, became embarrassed, and then ex-&#xD;
claimed, with vehemence, "Why' should I deny it?&#xD;
With you, at least, I need have no concealment. Yes,&#xD;
Walter, I do love her----truly, ardently. She charmed&#xD;
me while still a boy; you will, perhaps, say I am little&#xD;
more now. But, Walter, I have grown old fast; My&#xD;
late experience has matured me. I see her now with&#xD;
the eyes of a man-of one who knows his own wants-&#xD;
and find in her gentle sympathy, her ready comprehen-&#xD;
sion of me, her sweet unselfish c~&amp;amp;es for my happiness,&#xD;
the evidence of a character even more beautiful than the&#xD;
outward form in which it is presented. I love, not like&#xD;
a boy, dazzled and intoxicated, but with an appreciation&#xD;
of her so founded that it will last forever 1"&#xD;
He might ,have proceeded till wearied of his own&#xD;
voice. Walter was incapable of speech. The utmost&#xD;
he had ever imagined on the part of Oscar was a boyish&#xD;
excitement, perhaps already forgotten in the new scenes&#xD;
and the larger circle to which he had been introduced.&#xD;
It may be comprehended, then, with what~ feelings he&#xD;
heard this avowal. But the words her "sympathy,"&#xD;
her "cares for his happiness," while they struck still&#xD;
deeper, were inexplicable! "What," he asked himself;&#xD;
"what did they mean? Have I been blinded by a mis-&#xD;
erable selfdove? I will know the worst."&#xD;
"And she ?" he 'at length ventured to inquire.&#xD;
"I see, Walter," replied Oscar; "that, with your cool&#xD;
way of looking at things, you regard me only as an ex-~&#xD;

have no reason to despair. Not that I am such a puppy&#xD;

Walter was not exactly in tl~at frame of mind best fit-&#xD;
ted to answer such a question.&#xD;
He only replied? "No one, I believe, is always proof&#xD;
against them."&#xD;
"I, at least," continued Oscar, "am not. I believe,&#xD;
I slipuld rather say, I fear, I shall die early-perhaps&#xD;
soon. II thought myself well. I have had some inti-&#xD;
mations of late that suggest the contrary, and confirm&#xD;
an impression I have long had, but which never till now&#xD;
afflicted me. At present, therefore, IL deliberately avoid&#xD;
an explanation that might only commit her to greater&#xD;
suffering.' Will y6u not now believe in me, Walter,&#xD;
when you see I' am not incapable of self.control ?"&#xD;
"But do you equally avoid," asked Walter, evading&#xD;
the question, "do you equally avoid securing an inter-&#xD;
est that must lead to the same consequences ?"&#xD;
"I am not sure. It is so difficult when with her to&#xD;

resist the sweetness that seems to draw the very heart&#xD;
out of me. But if I err, it is at least not designedly.&#xD;
You will, of course, go there to-morrow. We will go&#xD;
together, and you shall see yourself how wise and reso-&#xD;
lute I can be."&#xD;
Walter could not trust himself with more than a si-&#xD;
lent assent, and Oscar paused for some moments; then,&#xD;
with much feeling, but with his usual manly frankness,&#xD;
said, "I am disappointed, Walter. I expected from you&#xD;
a sympathy more demonstrative. For this reason I&#xD;
longed to see you-to speak to you of what I could speak&#xD;
to no one else-my hopes ! my fears! But I see how it&#xD;
is. I am in your eyes still a boy; and this my first essay&#xD;
in the tender passion, to which many others will succeed&#xD;
before I am really caught! I thought you would better&#xD;
understand me. Well, well, time will show."&#xD;
Walter's distress was intolerable. What could he&#xD;
say? How so speak as neither to wound nor deceive&#xD;
Oscar? Neither to compromise Eleanor nor himself?&#xD;
The instinct of truth saved him.&#xD;
"Oscar," said he, in a tone so earnest and affectionate,&#xD;
that it could not but bring conviction, "never has my&#xD;
interest in you been so strong as at this moment. I be'&#xD;
lieve in your love; I respect your self-control, and I&#xD;
pray Heaven that your impressions of your health may&#xD;
be mistaken. But let us talk no farther at present. It&#xD;
is not best. &amp;amp;ood-night. We will do to-morrow what-&#xD;
ever you choose."&#xD;
He retired, but it was only to give vent to feelings he&#xD;
had with such difficulty suppressed. What they were,&#xD;
may be supposed easily divined by one as much in his&#xD;
confidence' as the reader presumes himself to be.&#xD;
But there were complications of which even he is yet&#xD;
ignorant.&#xD;
Out of a chaos of fear and perplexity there came ques-&#xD;
&#xD;

424          WAITER TRORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
tionings which Walter sought to resolve. "Was she,&#xD;
but lately so kind, so confiding, was she capricious and&#xD;
unstable? Could she have so little depth?" To one&#xD;
who, like himself; might say that he "could not forget,"&#xD;
this would be less pardonable Than much that was posi-&#xD;
tively wrong. "If such were the case, he could bear to&#xD;
lose her. It would be a stern effort, but a short one."&#xD;
"But let him be just. She was perhaps more con-&#xD;
sistent than himself. Had he not pronounced his own&#xD;
doom when he first tore himself from her? And, if she&#xD;
still met him kindly, had she not wisely and resolutely&#xD;
forbidden him to cross her threshold? Was not this&#xD;
sufficiently significant? If eompassi~wi bad subsequent-&#xD;
ly pleaded fbr Oscar-if the wishes of her friends had rec-&#xD;
ainmended, perhaps urged his suit-of what had he to&#xD;
complain? On the other hand, if this impression were&#xD;
so feeble that a previous p~efe]fence might yet be revived,&#xD;
in that case were not her own feelings entitled to consid-&#xD;
eration? Ah! let me not," he thought, "be tempted by&#xD;
this insidious suggestion."&#xD;
No; he dealt boldly and truly with his own soul, and&#xD;
he came resolved to his conclusion, lie would see them&#xD;
together.. He. would observe her calmly, and, if he de-&#xD;
tected even a leaning in favor of Oscar, he would 'crush&#xD;
unreie~itingly the hope that had recently dawned on&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
The next day they drove to the Oaks. They were&#xD;
shown into the dining-room, where Walter was present-&#xD;
ed to Mrs. Grafton and her ~Pather, and received very&#xD;
civilly by Mr. and Mrs. Meredith.&#xD;
A servant was sent to inform Miss Eleanor, but she&#xD;
already knew whom 'she was to see. Her quick eye had&#xD;
caught a glimpse of Walter as he alighted from the car-&#xD;
riage. She was as quickly reminded of the self.con-&#xD;
demnation their last interview had caused her, and of&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.           426&#xD;
the resolutions she had then formed. To these was add-&#xD;
eci the reflection that she was now to meet him in the&#xD;
presence of others; and she was seized with a nervous&#xD;
tremor lest she might betray what her present nicer&#xD;
sense of propriety taught her should never have escaped&#xD;
her own breast.&#xD;
Under this apprehension she entered the room. The&#xD;
consciousness of; constraint increased it. For relief she&#xD;
addresse~l Oscar, and the warmth she had not dared to&#xD;
manifest to Walter spent itself on him. Denying a&#xD;
healthful draught to the one, she unwittingly gave poison&#xD;
to the other~&#xD;
Mr. ~raften ebsevvccl the diffcrcnc~.&#xD;
"Poor Walter!" thought he, as he turned an inquiry'&#xD;
ing look at Eleanor.&#xD;
She perceived it. The fear of being watched took&#xD;
possession of her. She became more conscious, and, of&#xD;
course, more cold.&#xD;
Walter could not bukfeel it; but, though perplexed,&#xD;
he was'still incredulous as to a real change. He endeav-&#xD;
ored, by his own behavior, to relieve her. He talked of&#xD;
indifferent things, and she gradually regained more self-&#xD;
possession, but she was not natural. An increasing&#xD;
dread of some mistake. on her part-of unkindness, in-&#xD;
consistency~-gave to her countenance an uncertain ex-&#xD;
pression. Her manner became ambiguous. "It might&#xD;
indicate an interest in Oscar it might conceal an en-&#xD;
during but repressed sentiment toward himself." A&#xD;
lovers instinct inclined to the last. He felt as if one&#xD;
word, one look, would be an 'open sesame' to that heart&#xD;
never closed to him before. But there was that, even.&#xD;
stronger than love, which forbade that word, that look.&#xD;
Retreating from Eleanor, he advanced toward Mrs.&#xD;
Grafton; and they were mutually so well pleased, that&#xD;
Eleanor? having no farther opportunity to address him,&#xD;
permitted herself to be engrossed b~ Oscar.&#xD;

Endurance, however perfect, has, like all things, its&#xD;
limits; and, on the entrance of other company, Walter&#xD;
succeeded in drawing Oscar, reluctantly! away.&#xD;
Thus passed a week. Walter, compelled when at&#xD;
home to listen to the raptures, plans, and hopes of Os-&#xD;
oar, was glad to escape them even by visits to the Oaks,&#xD;
though the same unpropitious circumstances prevented&#xD;
any 'clearer comprehension of Eleanor; the same circle&#xD;
always present, the same obstacles to any conversation&#xD;
with her. He was satisfied with no inferences that could&#xD;
be drawn from the small opportunities afforded him.&#xD;
Eleanor, once open as the day, became an enigma to&#xD;
him. A few weeks since, animated, confiding, natural;&#xD;
now, restless, disturbed, and with a mind evidently ill at&#xD;
ease. At one moment he would compassionate what&#xD;
might be. painful vacillation on the subject of Oscar, the&#xD;
~ next reproach her inconsistency to himself. "But why?"&#xD;
he would ask. "Did Ii not counsel her 'to forget me?&#xD;
Did I not abjure the language of lo'~re to her very face?&#xD;
Was she to be faithful to a phantom? No; I ought to&#xD;
be the sufferer. I would not, if I could, turn the trem-&#xD;
/&#xD;
bling ~cale that vibrates in favor of Oscar."&#xD;
One evening, the weather proving unfit for Oscar to&#xD;
go, as he had purposed, to the Oaks, in the hope of at&#xD;
least hearing from there, he persuaded Walter to do so.&#xD;
lie found the 'family, as usual, together, Mrs. Meredith&#xD;
and Eleanor at work. The conversation for a while was&#xD;
general; and, though Eleanor took little part in it, she&#xD;
seemed more at ease than usual. At length Walter ap-&#xD;
proached the table at which she sat.&#xD;
"As industrious as ever 1" said he.&#xD;
She 'looked up; the light fell full on her face, but a&#xD;
smile even brighter overspread it.&#xD;
Oh no I' I accomplish nothing. lam a lazy girl now."&#xD;
"Can that mean;" thought Walter, "that the heart is&#xD;
too busy to let head or haftds work ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.             427&#xD;

"Some people can afford to be idle," said he. "The&#xD;
bee is so in winter, you know."&#xD;
"Yes; but I have gathered no honey, I fear."&#xD;
"None, perhaps, that you will exhibit; for, like the&#xD;
bees, you do not fancy a glass hive."&#xD;
A pleasant reply was on her lip, hut her father ap.&#xD;
preached, and it was checked.&#xD;
"What is this I hear?" asked he. "Is young Middle-&#xD;
ton going to Bermuda this autumn ?"&#xD;
"lie thinks of it, sir," replied Walter.&#xD;
"But not for his health, ~surely': he looks better than&#xD;
"'Tis, I hope, rather a measure of precaution than ne-&#xD;
cessity. His father has always had a dread of our win-&#xD;
ters for him."&#xD;
"Does his father go with him ?"&#xD;
"No, sir; I shall do so~'~&#xD;
"Indeed! That may be for your advantage. I am&#xD;
glad to hear it. When do you go ?"&#xD;
"We shall leave here as soon 'as Mr. Middleton returns,&#xD;
on a preliminary excursion, which will occupy some&#xD;
weeks; after which we shall proceed to Bermuda."&#xD;
Eleanor had not spoken, and Walter had avoided to&#xD;
look at her. Now' a movement of her chair compelled&#xD;
him to do so. Her smile was gone. 'A troubled ex-&#xD;
pression replaced it, and, in a flurried manner, she gath-&#xD;
ered her work as if 'to change her seat.&#xD;
"Can I assist you ?" he asked.&#xD;
Without answering, she hastened toward the door, left&#xD;
the room, and did not return.&#xD;
Mr. Meredith took the seat she had left, and Walter&#xD;
was condemned, while thinking of any thing else, to list-&#xD;
en to details and questions as to 'the climate~ and condi-&#xD;
tion' of Bermuda, the opportunities he might find there&#xD;
of advancing his own interests, how he would like such&#xD;

a residence, and the offer of letters to two or three ac-&#xD;
quaintances Mr. Meredith happened to have there; all&#xD;
of which, however well meant, were at this moment as&#xD;
unwelcome as unnecessary; and, as soon as he could es-&#xD;
cape, he took his leave.&#xD;
Arrived at home, another trial awaited him. Oscar&#xD;
insisted on knowing how Eleanor looked, how she was&#xD;
dressed, how occupied; if she were in spirits; if she&#xD;
spoke of him?&#xD;
Walter submitted to "the question" manfully. He&#xD;
even did more. He magnanimously and unflinchingly&#xD;
related the effect produced on her by the announcement&#xD;
of his approaching departure. He did well. It was not&#xD;
more delightful to Qscar than a wholesome, because in-&#xD;
durating process to himself.&#xD;
Faint not, Walter!&#xD;
"And thou shalt know, 'are long!&#xD;
know how sublime a thing it i~&#xD;
To suffer, and be strong!"&#xD;
Eleanor, meanwhile, was little to be envied. She had&#xD;
acted impulsively, and, as was often her experience, now&#xD;
regretted it.&#xD;
Walter, occupied with studying her, had been unaware&#xD;
of the change in his own manner, scarcely to be avoided&#xD;
under the circumstances. Each had thus unconsciously&#xD;
distressed and repelled, the other a~d 'were equallyseek-&#xD;
ing an explanation of what was only in themselves.&#xD;
"And now he is going!" exclaimed Eleanor, as she&#xD;
sat leaning her throbbing head on her hands; "to be&#xD;
gone for months, and then, of course, not to return here.&#xD;
I may not see him, heaven only knows whe~i! He goes,&#xD;
too, without' a single' word of' interest in me since we&#xD;

I ran away! I will go down; I will sit by him; will&#xD;
talk to him as I used to do; will even say, 'What is this&#xD;
dreadful blank that has come between us?"' and, starting&#xD;
up, she rushed to the parlor. She was too late. Walter&#xD;
had gone.&#xD;

&#xD;
CIIAPTEI~ XIIL&#xD;
THE next morning Walter had business in the city,&#xD;
but Oscar declined accompanying him, reserving him.&#xD;
self for a drive to the Oaks in the afternoon. Taking a&#xD;
book from the library, he retired to his own room com*&#xD;
municating with it, and threw himself on a couch, not&#xD;
so much to read as to muse.&#xD;
And now his ardent spirit, refined, but not tamed, by&#xD;
its companionship with a delicate frame, indulged in the&#xD;
fond fancies of sanguine, unsuspecting youth. "He&#xD;
must, indeed, absent himself for a short time. He was&#xD;
aware that he was less well than he had been, but it was&#xD;
the natural consequence of sorrow' and depressing cir-&#xD;
cumstances. He was not in the best condition, therefore,&#xD;
to encounter a northern winter. But he should return&#xD;
well! He had always improved by a change of climate.&#xD;
And then he should be justified in a full avowal to Elea-&#xD;
nor. But could he be sure of the answer he desired?&#xD;
Sure! no! he was not so presumptuous. Yet neither&#xD;
could he despair when he reflected on her almost tender&#xD;
interest in his happiness. The feeling, too, betrayed at&#xD;
the intelligence of his departure! Dear, kind Walter;&#xD;
how true his sympathy! manly and self-restrained as he&#xD;
always was, yet how moved had he been while telling&#xD;
him. And even if she now feels only friendship, might&#xD;
not his faithful love in time secure its reward? Oh&#xD;
yes! he would not doubt it !"&#xD;
Hope gilded his future in her brightest dyes. His&#xD;
book lay unopened by his side, while his own face pre-&#xD;
sented a page that would have repaid the perusal. His&#xD;
kindling eye, his excited color, alas! too high, and the&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
smile that played about his mouth betrayed the promise&#xD;
that his heart whispered!&#xD;
The door into the library was open. A footstep was&#xD;
heard in the hall, and a voice he did not know incjuired&#xD;
of the servant in attendance if Mr. Middleton were at&#xD;
home.&#xD;
"INo, sir."&#xD;
"is he in the city?"&#xD;
"No, sir. lie has been absent some time."&#xD;
"Wheii will he return ?"&#xD;
"Perhaps not for several days, sir."&#xD;
There was a pause, apparently hesitation and disap-&#xD;
pointment, which the servant perceiving, said,&#xD;
"His son is at home, sir."&#xD;
"His eon! indeed! I will see him, then."&#xD;
Oscar rose and went into the room, where he saw a&#xD;
middle-aged gentleman, of a grave, rather cold, business&#xD;
like appearance, who announced himself as Mr. Bolton.&#xD;
Oscar bowed, and begged himto be seated. The name&#xD;
was new to him.&#xD;
"Mr. Middieton's son, I presume."&#xD;
Oscar returned an affirmative bow.&#xD;
"His only son?"&#xD;
Again Oscar bowed.&#xD;
"There were others, I think."&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"But none of them are living?"&#xD;
"No, sir," said Oscar, rather annoyed by such inquP&#xD;
ries from a stranger.&#xD;
"I am sorry~ not to see your father a uce," continued&#xD;
Mr. Bolton, "as I wished without d o put into his&#xD;
own hand this packet, containing p pe s of importance.&#xD;
But the next best thing is~to place i   custody,&#xD;
whose interest in them is not less than his own," and he&#xD;
laid it on the library table, by his side.&#xD;

WALTER TIIORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
"I will see that my father has it as soon as he ar-&#xD;
rives."&#xD;
The gentleman then rose to depart. Oscar repeated&#xD;
his invitation to rest himself; but he declined.&#xD;
"Before I go, however," said he, "I may, II hope, be&#xD;
permitted to express my satisfaction at seeing you here,&#xD;
young gentleman, in your proper place."&#xD;
"Here !" thought Oscar; "where else could I be ?"&#xD;
"A fact)" continued Mr. Bolton,' "that I shall have&#xD;
great pleasure in communicating to my respected client,&#xD;
to whom I shall write to~.day."&#xD;
Oscar stared. "The man is under some gross mis-&#xD;
take !" thought he.&#xD;
"You look surprised," said the gentleman, and well&#xD;
may be, that a stranger should be aware of what'~pre-&#xD;
sume, has been but lately made known to yourself. But&#xD;
the confidential relation in which nay respected client-&#xD;
your honored mother, sir, as you must understand-~has&#xD;
thought proper to place me, has necessarily put me in&#xD;
possession of many private and family matters."&#xD;
"The man is mad!" thought Oscar, listening in silence,&#xD;
and with a look of extreme perplexity, which induced&#xD;
Mr. Bolton to repeat his inquiries.&#xD;
"You are Mr. Middleton's only son? I think you&#xD;
said so."&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"The others are dead? I understood you so to say."&#xD;
Oscar again assented.&#xD;
"Not that, if living, it would be material," he con-&#xD;
tinued, with the same cross-examining air, "but it would&#xD;
be disagreeable, of course-"&#xD;
"Sir I" interrupted Oscar, indignantly.&#xD;
But, not heeding, the gentleman proceeded.&#xD;
"Yes; I am right. His only son, heretofore known&#xD;
as Walter Thornley-.--his only child by his only wedded&#xD;
&#xD;
ii t&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEl? AT THE PAST.         433&#xD;
wife..--residing in England, she being a subject of his&#xD;
British majesty; the rights of which child I am sent over&#xD;
to make known, and, if necessary, to enforce; but which&#xD;
rights, I am happy to observe, have been acknowledged&#xD;
without my interference."&#xD;
Thi~, like what had preceded, would have been re-&#xD;
garded as some unaccountable mistake, or the ravings&#xD;
of a disordered mind; but that, as Oscar had grown old-&#xD;
er, his father's peculiarities had occasioned him much&#xD;
painful perplexity-his strange paroxysms of unexplain-&#xD;
ed distress, and the mystery that rested on his early life.&#xD;
Habitual respect for him had rejected the idea of crime&#xD;
or disgrace, but a vague fear had haunted him of some&#xD;
youthful wrong-doing, the remembrance of which had,&#xD;
perhaps by a morbid exaggeration, been. a spectre in his&#xD;
path through life. These words, therefore, fearful and&#xD;
incomprehensible, were received as a* revelation, and&#xD;
struck on a chord the vibrations of which were too much&#xD;
for his sensitive nature.&#xD;
Turning deadly pale, his hand pressed to his breast as&#xD;
if in acute pain, he staggered, and would have fallen, had&#xD;
not Mr. Bolton, extending his arms, caught him. His&#xD;
cry of alarm brought in a servant from the hall, and to-&#xD;
gether they succeeded in laying him on the couch in his&#xD;
own room.,&#xD;
Supposing him to be faint) the servant hastened for a&#xD;
restorative,, and Mr. Bolton looked with consternation&#xD;
on the mischief which, he knew not why, he seemed to&#xD;
have caused. A moment passed, and a glass was. offer-&#xD;
ed to Oscar. Without opening his eyes, with a feeble&#xD;
motion of the hand he repulsed it; and they saw with&#xD;
dismay that blood was issuing from his mouth.&#xD;
"A physician !" exclaimed Mr. Bolton; "lQse no&#xD;
time!"&#xD;
The man, in obeying the injunction, encountered Wal-&#xD;

ter entering. One glance revealed the condition of his&#xD;
friend. Ordering the servant to remain, he rushed from&#xD;
the house. The chaise of the family physician stood at&#xD;
a door in the neighborhood. He flew rather than ran;&#xD;
entered and found him just departing. Few words were1&#xD;
necessary, and they were at Mr. Middleton's with the&#xD;
speed which, unhappily, the case required.&#xD;
Whatever skill and experience suggested to a judi-&#xD;
cious man, well understanding the constitution of his&#xD;
patient, was at once resorted to, with an injunction to&#xD;
silence and tranquillity, and no attendance but that&#xD;
strictly necessary. Oscar spoke not. His eyes remain-&#xD;
ed closed, and only by an occasional movement of his&#xD;
hand he indicated a want or rejected an offer.&#xD;
"He is very right," whispered Doctor Barton. "The&#xD;
less he hears, sees, or speaks, the better. lulis pulse be.&#xD;
trays much disturbance of the system."&#xD;
Alas! They did. not understand that in the miserable&#xD;
conflict within, he instinctively excluded every sight and&#xD;
sound.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Mr. Bolton, still under his original mistake,&#xD;
with many expressions of regret, 'the more hearty as he&#xD;
believed that the calamity nearly touched his "honored&#xD;
client," took his leave; and the doctor, having at length&#xD;
succeeded in checking the hemorrhage, left Oscar in the&#xD;
care of Walter 'and the faithful Wilson.&#xD;
After dispatching a note to Mr. Grafton, Walter seat-&#xD;
ed~himself sufficiently near to watch, without disturbing,&#xD;
Oscar. The day was now declining, and the darkened&#xD;
room, the perfect quiet, and an anodyne, would, he trust-&#xD;
ed, induce sleep. He was not yet aware that a thought&#xD;
had been rudely thrust into that gentle breast that "man-&#xD;
dragora nor all the drowsy sirups of the world" could&#xD;
effectually still!&#xD;
Bu~ at length, for a brief space, the "sweet restorer"&#xD;
&#xD;
came. The restless muscles were quiet ; the nerves&#xD;
ceased their agitation; a more regular pulsation return-&#xD;
ed; the face was calm. He slept.&#xD;
The night had fallen, and so profound was the still-&#xD;
ness that the faintest sound might have been detected.&#xD;
Walter heard only the. ticking of his watch, and the&#xD;
breathing from the sick-bed, at first quick, but by de-&#xD;
grees indicating the better rest of the sleeper.&#xD;
"Thank heaven 1" he ejaculated, with a sense of in-&#xD;
finite relief.&#xD;
An hour or more passed, and carriage-wheels were&#xD;
heard. They approached the house. They stopped at&#xD;
the door; it opened. Some one entered, met by others&#xD;
cautiously approaching from within. Then suppressed&#xD;
voices were hoard. Then low sounds of distress came&#xD;
from the library.&#xD;
Walter, afraid to stir, did not attempt to close the&#xD;
door of Oscar's room, till tl~ie sounds becoming mores&#xD;
audible, he ventured to move toward it. In doing so&#xD;
he was shocked to perceive Mr. Middleton extended on&#xD;
the sofa, his face covered with his hands. Mr. Grafton&#xD;
stood near him. Walter remained immovable. Mr.&#xD;
Grafton turned, saw, and beckoned to him. Walter ad-&#xD;
vanced. "Speak!" said Mr. 43Trafton, in a low but de-&#xD;
cided tone. "'Tis the best iifioment. One strong emo-&#xD;
tion will control another."&#xD;
Walter obeyed. Approaching the sofa, he knelt, and&#xD;
in a tender voice uttered one word:&#xD;
"Father!"&#xD;
It was enough. Mr. Middleton turned on Walter a&#xD;
startled and., agitated look, but unattended by any vio-'&#xD;
lent demonstration. On the contrary, putting his arm&#xD;
gently tound him, he said, with an emphasis that went&#xD;
to his heart, but in a low and broken voice, "My noble&#xD;
son!"&#xD;

answered theft' scrutiny with an expression of such man-&#xD;

fered Walter to retain his hand, and gazed on him in&#xD;
silence, till, by a sign, Mr. Grafton called him to his&#xD;
side.&#xD;
"The worst is over," he whispered. "Return to your&#xD;
charge. Mr. Middleton is mine."&#xD;
Oscar still slept. The night was far advanced, but&#xD;
Walter was too deeply moved to sleep. While he re-&#xD;
flected with thankfulness that the dreaded interview-&#xD;
for which he had in some degree been prepared-was&#xD;
past, he knew there was much yet to suffer. He had,&#xD;
indeed, found that for which hc had been so long impor-&#xD;
tunate-for which he had wept and prayed. He had a&#xD;
name, a place among the kindred of men. He was no&#xD;
longer a waif, a stray on the great common of the world,&#xD;
to be picked up and claimed by he could not tell whom&#xD;
--liable at any moment to be dissevered from all he held&#xD;
dear, and united, perhaps indissolubly, to all most ab-&#xD;
horrent.&#xD;
But there was another side-.darker, perhaps, than be&#xD;
feared-full of wrong and wretchedness! There was an&#xD;
innocent sufferer, from whom all was wrenched that he&#xD;
himself had gained! What new duties were involved&#xD;
in these strange developments? Was it for him, who,&#xD;
when cast away, had been gathered in; when desert-&#xD;
ed, had been sheltered; when unknown, had been cared&#xD;
for, instructed, and protected, and to whom rights de-&#xD;
spaired of had now been restored-was it for him to&#xD;
task more? "No," thought he, the same self-denying&#xD;
purpose animating him by which he had already been&#xD;
actuated, "No; ,4er love, too puro to be affected by ex-&#xD;
&#xD;
eternal changes, shall compensate him for all he has lost I&#xD;
If I yet have influence it shall be used for him."&#xD;
While Walter kept his unbroken vigil, Mr. Grafton&#xD;
devoted himself to Mr. Middleton.&#xD;
He had hurried to the Lodge on receiving Walter's&#xD;
note. The packet on the table had caught his attention.&#xD;
"It was left," Wilson said, "by the gentleman whose&#xD;
conversation, had brought on all the trouble."&#xD;
The truth flashed on Mr.~ Grafton---already prepared&#xD;
for it. The communication, so carefully, for the present,&#xD;
averted, had been made by a stranger; ignorant, too, of&#xD;
the nature with which he was dealing. The result did&#xD;
not surprise him.&#xD;
Mr. Middleton being induced to withdraw to his own&#xD;
room, a fearful scene ensued. A new terror seized him.&#xD;
"Oscar was not prostrated by an inevitable disease. No;&#xD;
the blow might never have fallen. He himself was his&#xD;
murderer! The avenging judgment of God was upon&#xD;
him! The victim demanded was his own child-slain&#xD;
by his own hand I The fruit of his body for the sin of~&#xD;
his soul!"&#xD;
Though no two men could be more different, Mr.&#xD;
Grafton was the person who at this moment could most&#xD;
influence him. His sympathy-.---ever responding to the&#xD;
cry of the afflicted,, from whatever cause-like the oil&#xD;
and wine in the wounds of him who fell among thieves,&#xD;
shed its balm on the sore and remorseful spirit that now&#xD;
poured forth its agony into his heart. His efforts were&#xD;
at length so far successful that he left Mr. Middleton in&#xD;
some degree composed. His next care was to see Mr.&#xD;
Bolton, to inform him of the actual state of things, and&#xD;
to secure his silence, for the reason that publicity at&#xD;
present could only aggravate the feelings of all.&#xD;
The morning found Oscar more refreshed and calm&#xD;
than they had dared to hope. But a deep seriousness&#xD;

438          WALTER THORNLEY; O1~,&#xD;
was on his countenance. He watched every one who&#xD;
approached; he listened to every sound. He did not&#xD;
attempt to speak, or even to move. He seemed reserv-&#xD;
ing his strength for some definite purpose.&#xD;
The physician came. He pronounced every thing as&#xD;
favorable as he had expected. This was ambiguous, but&#xD;
no one dared to ask any thing more explicit.&#xD;
Oscar made a sign for a pencil, and, with a slight ef-&#xD;
fort, wrote "My father is returned; I must see him."&#xD;
The physician hesitated. Oscar perceived it. An im-&#xD;
patient frown obscured for an instant the almost deathly&#xD;
calm of his face. "I must," he wrote, "for one word."&#xD;
It was no longer opposed, and Mr. Grafton went to'&#xD;
inform Mr. Middleton. They returned together. Mr.&#xD;
Grafton and the physician withdrew to the library.&#xD;
Walter rose to follow them, but a sign from Oscar de-&#xD;
tained him.&#xD;
Mr. Middleton, with feelings that no words could ade-&#xD;
quately convey, approached and leaned over his son.&#xD;
Oscar's calmness seemed something supernatural. Fix-&#xD;
ing his eye intently on his father's agitated face, his own&#xD;
colorless and quiet almost to sternness, occupied with&#xD;
one idea, he yet uttered no sound. At length lUs lips&#xD;
moved, and one word passed them-." My mother ?"&#xD;
"I know what you would ask !" exclaimed his father.&#xD;
"She was as unconscious of wrong to others as to her-&#xD;
self. She was pure as the angels to whom she has gone!"&#xD;
A smile, sweet as that of infancy, a glance upcast, ex-&#xD;
pressed the joy and gratitude these words inspired.&#xD;
Looking to Walter, he said, speaking very low, bu~t with&#xD;
much significance, "You hear; I thought so. I shall die&#xD;
happy." Then, closing his eyes, he seemed to decline all&#xD;
farther communication. Mr. Middleton was equally unfit&#xD;
for i~,and, on the entrance of the physician, who imposed&#xD;
the most rigorous restrictions, he left the room.&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.           439&#xD;
During many succeeding days judiciouS care and treat-&#xD;
ment had their proper effect, and the physician's opinion&#xD;
was decidedly favorable. The stony look was gone; his&#xD;
natural sweetness returned. As* his father sat by his&#xD;
bed, he would often extend his hand, as with a desire to&#xD;
comfort him.; and Walter, his unwearied attendant, his&#xD;
loving eyes were always seeking. Every day now&#xD;
brought some improvement. He was allowed to change&#xD;
his position more freely, to talk, with certain restrictions,&#xD;
and to sit up. All things promised well, and his physi-&#xD;
cian authorized the confident hope thus inspired.&#xD;

440          WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIII.&#xD;
WALTER had not been to the Oaks since the illness&#xD;
of Oscar; but he was now so much better as not to re-&#xD;
quire his presence, even preferring to be alone; he drove&#xD;
over, therefore, to see Mr. Grafton, with whom he had&#xD;
business.&#xD;
As he approached the house, he hoped that he should&#xD;
not see Eleanor. He asked, accordingly, only for Mr.&#xD;
Grafton, but a light step on the staircase made him aware&#xD;
that his wish was not granted. Looking up, he perceiv-&#xD;
ed her descending. She had not yet seen him. As she&#xD;
came nearer her cheek flushed, her eye brightened, and,&#xD;
with a spring, she was by his side.&#xD;
"Ah! Mr. Thornley," she exclaimed, forgetting the&#xD;
caution which his own reserve and absence rendered un-&#xD;
necessary, "indeed! 'tis long since you were here."&#xD;
"She has heard," he thought, "that he is doing well.&#xD;
I wish he could see hoW happy it has made her! it would&#xD;
be his best medicine."&#xD;
"Yes," he said, "it is, indeed, a lQng time to be so&#xD;
near, and yet-so----" "far apart," he would have said, but&#xD;
he corrected himself-" and yet unable to see my friends.&#xD;
But we are, as you know, so much relieved about Oscar,&#xD;
that I can not regret any thing."&#xD;
"Oh yes! I have heard; 'tis delightful! Yes, yes, he&#xD;
will recover; you may be certain of it ;" and, in the&#xD;
hopeful temper natural to her, arid to encourage Walter,&#xD;
she continued; "the attack, I understand, was quite ac-&#xD;
cidental; one that might happen to any body-.not at&#xD;
all likely to return again; and then, you know, Nature&#xD;
is always on the side of youth."&#xD;
&#xD;
-v&#xD;

A PEE? AT TIIfl PAST.          441&#xD;
He ~as a little surprised, almost pained, at her man-&#xD;
ner. "It was," he thought, "something too easy;" but&#xD;
he repelled the harsh imputation. "Love is stronger&#xD;
than fear," he reflected. "Poor girl! has she never&#xD;
heard that the young die ?"&#xD;
"The doctor, I understand," continued Eleanor, "gives&#xD;
every assurance."&#xD;
"Oh yes; he justifies all you say. But where is Mr.&#xD;
Grafton? IL came to see him."&#xD;
"Only to see him? Mamma will not let you go be-&#xD;
fore dinner, II am sure."&#xD;
But, pleading the necessity of his return, he hurried&#xD;
away.&#xD;
Having seen Mr. Grafton, he drove rapidly home. Os-&#xD;
car was not quite so well as he had left him. A little&#xD;
excited, feverish, and exhausted.&#xD;
Walter's anxious lqok called for an explanation, and&#xD;
Oscar, with a smile, pointed to a sheet of paper near him.&#xD;
He had been writing.&#xD;
"Oh, Oscar! how could you?" said he, reproachfully.&#xD;
He waved his hand to ward off reproof. "'Tis done,"&#xD;
said he, and Walter was silent.&#xD;
After a few moments, pointing to the paper, it was&#xD;
handed to him. He folded it, put it into Walter's hand,&#xD;
and said, with earnestness, "For ~,'ou; read it alone."&#xD;
The restlessness gradually subsided, and he fell into a&#xD;
sleep that it was hoped would entirely remove the effects&#xD;
of his ill-timed exertion. But, though he slept, his face&#xD;
was not calm. Slight contractions of the brow and&#xD;
mouth disturbed it. Sad thoughts seemed flitting over&#xD;
it, and, occasionally, a faint sigh struggled forth.&#xD;
Walter remained motionless near him, and, when he&#xD;
awoke, a kind smile acknowledged his care; but it yield-&#xD;
~d to the same deep seriousness, so marked in the first&#xD;
days of his illness. His eyes were fixed in thought. He&#xD;

442          WALTER TH0RNLEY; QR,&#xD;
seemed unconscious of the presence of any one. Mcdi-&#xD;
cine was brought him ~ he took it without a question.&#xD;
Food was offered, garnished with savory remarks from&#xD;
Wilson; he received it mechanically. His father enter-&#xD;
ed, and his mounting color and quivering lip showed&#xD;
him unequal to the visit. He retired, and Oscar became&#xD;
calm.&#xD;
At night Walter retired to the library, where he had&#xD;
slept since Oscar had been so weU as to dispense with a&#xD;
nearer attendance. Waiting till all was quiet, he drew&#xD;
the manuscript from his pocket which Oscar had given&#xD;
him, and read as follows:&#xD;
"Though my heart and brain are full, I must be brief.&#xD;
"I have at last had a communication with my father.&#xD;
11 could weep tears of blood! Oh, how gladly would&#xD;
31 die to expiate the wrong he has inflicted, to remove&#xD;
the suffering he. endures. Alas! my death can only&#xD;
aggravate his misery. That this 'can not be long de-&#xD;
layed I have the, fullest conviction; no hopes nor assu-&#xD;
rances deceive me~ I am dying even now. Receive,&#xD;
then, these, my parting words; I may have strength for&#xD;
no other. Walter! long the' brother of my heart, no&#xD;
natural ties can make you dearer; and, thank lElleaven,&#xD;
nothing can render you less so! Do not, Thr an instant,&#xD;
wrong me by such a suspicion. Comfort my father!&#xD;
and one other care I leave with you. See Eleanor. It&#xD;
can not be that I have mistaken the nature of her sym~.&#xD;
pathy! But,' if I have 'done so, offended delicacy will be&#xD;
appeased by the grave. Explain tQ her my silence, if&#xD;
she does not already understandit.. I would not be re-&#xD;
inembered as trifling and~ inconsistent. Convey 'to her&#xD;
the assurance of my' undying love. Say to her that at&#xD;
this momelat I am' conscious of no earthly interest stron-&#xD;
ger than my desire for her happiness. That I pray she&#xD;
&#xD;
A PEEP AT THE PAST.          443&#xD;
may find it in a union with ~ne who, though he can not&#xD;
love her more, may better deserve her than myself. ~.&#xD;
"Oh, how many thoughts struggle for utterance as&#xD;
I think of her! The happy past returns to me, the&#xD;
blessed future that I hoped for beams upon me! But&#xD;
of these I must not speak. Time is closing its gates.&#xD;
The opening portals of another world demand my&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;
"Do not grieve for me; I go to my mother! 'Tis well&#xD;
it is 'so. Earth has Yio place for her, nor for me. Death&#xD;
has no terror! I deserve nothing, 1 claim nothing, but&#xD;
throw myself; with the faith 'of a child, on Him who&#xD;
never rejected any that came to Him. To my kind&#xD;
friends-all----31 can not specify-my last love and thanks.&#xD;
And now, my d~ar '~nd faithful friend and brother, be&#xD;
heaven's choicest blessings yours! My parting soul will&#xD;
rely upon you. Let me feel the pressure. of your hand&#xD;
when 1 can not return it, and whisper peace and love to&#xD;
me, even when you believe "the dull, cold ear of death"&#xD;
is insensible. The spirit mayperceive, though the bodi-&#xD;
ly organism is dissolving. Have we not heard of strange&#xD;
suspensions of the physical powers, mistaken for death&#xD;
itself; when yet the mind was conscious? Farewell, my&#xD;
brother 1"&#xD;
"My brother !" echoed the throbbing heart of Walter.&#xD;
"Dear, generous, magnanimous Oscar! Can it be that&#xD;
I must part with you?"&#xD;
Overcome by emotion, he threw himself back in his&#xD;
chair, and yielded to the recollections that'came rushing&#xD;
over him-to the fearful forebodings that cast their&#xD;
shadows before - the loving instinct with which Oscar&#xD;
had clung to him from the first moment they met; his&#xD;
confiding, child-like temper, still the; ,same, however&#xD;
modified by the growth of his character; the brave,&#xD;

444          WALTEI~ TIIORNI~EY; OR,&#xD;
yet humble spirit in which he now prepared for "the&#xD;
supreme hour," that, perhaps, he too surely predicted!&#xD;
"Ali! my brother I" exclaimed he; "loved but to be&#xD;
lamented! found but to be lost! How in this hard world&#xD;
am I-reserved, perhaps repulsive, distrustfuy..ho~ am&#xD;
I ever to replace the love you voluntarily gave me ?"&#xD;
Absorbed in these reflections, Walter was unconscious&#xD;
of time, till a moan from Oscar arrested his attention.&#xD;
Starting up, he went noiselessly into his room and ap-&#xD;
proached the bed, where he trusted to find nothing worse&#xD;
than disturbed sleep. lie beheld, with horror, the life-&#xD;
stream again issuing from his mouth. His face was&#xD;
deadly pale, but perfectly calm. He exerted himself to&#xD;
extend a hand to Walter, then directed it upward. I~&#xD;
fell heavily, and a fresh gush of blood betrayed the ef-&#xD;
fort it had cost him.&#xD;
His father and the physician were summoned. The&#xD;
face of the latter confirmed the terrors of Mr. Middleton&#xD;
and Walter. Oscar alone was serene. In the words of&#xD;
the.Oriental poet,&#xD;
"lie alone could smile&#xD;
While all around him wept."&#xD;
The usual remedies had some effect, but the extreme&#xD;
exhaustion was fearful, and the doctor felt himself com-&#xD;
pelled to admit to Mr. Middleton his alarm, though with&#xD;
some qix~difications.&#xD;
Oscar more accurately interpreted his condition. He&#xD;
looked first at his father, then at Walter, and, with an&#xD;
expression evidently intended to remind him of his re-&#xD;
quest, he motioned for his hand. When given, he feebly&#xD;
gasped it, and Walter, comprehending his wish, seated&#xD;
himself by 'his side. A gentle inclination of his head&#xD;
signified his satisfaction. His eyes, full of tenderness,&#xD;
were directed alternately to ]~is father and his friend.&#xD;
At length they closed, and he seemed to elee?,&#xD;

The physician left them for half an hour, at which&#xD;
time he returned. He immediately 'detected a change.&#xD;
He placed his hand on the pulse; it was weak and flint.&#xD;
tering. The eyes were partially open, but there was&#xD;
"no speculation" in them! Their sense, now shut to&#xD;
earth, was turned&#xD;
"To the luminous side&#xD;
Of Death-"&#xD;
and a sweet peace had descended on the countenance,&#xD;
that, seemed to say "the welcGme was heard in the heav-&#xD;
enly world crc the farewell was hushed in this t"&#xD;
In speechless sorrow they watched the gentle parting,&#xD;
which 'no suffering aggravated. Mr. Middleton, with&#xD;
eyes fixed, stood motionless, as if stricken by a hand in-&#xD;
visible to all but him; while Walter, with head inclined,&#xD;
whispered words of love that could only.be answered&#xD;
from the spirit-land,! The feeble, intermitting pulse&#xD;
failed, the low, scarce audible breathing, ceased-Oscar&#xD;
was gone!&#xD;

&#xD;
OIIAPTER XLIV.&#xD;
ON the appointed day, at the soft twilight hour; the&#xD;
last sad offices were ~performed; and Walter, seeking,&#xD;
when all was done, "a place where to weep, entered into&#xD;
his chamber and wept there." Feelings restrained in&#xD;
consideration of Mr. Middleton were no longer to 'be&#xD;
controlled. Leaning his head on his arms, crossed on&#xD;
the table before him, sorrow subdued him as nothing&#xD;
had ever done. That chill of loneliness, which death&#xD;
only can bring, came over him. As yet, he knew xiot&#xD;
what relations might exist between Mr. Middleton and&#xD;
himself. Engrossed by the same object of intense con-&#xD;
cern, their peculiar interests were so merged in a com-&#xD;
mon sorrow that, except the first few words of recogni-&#xD;
tion, no communication strictly personal had passed be-&#xD;
tween them. He had lost a brother; he knew not yet&#xD;
if he had found a father. That brother, too, the truth~&#xD;
Ltd friend on whom he had relied, as an unfailing fount-&#xD;
ain of affection; and he had so few to love him! That&#xD;
friend, whose unselfish nature a trial most unusual had&#xD;
only more perfectly revealed! "Why were such things?"&#xD;
The great mystery of death met him with a power&#xD;
such as he had never before felt. The strange, the in~&#xD;
conceivable change oppressed him. lie, who so lately&#xD;
withheld not a thought from him, had now passed into&#xD;
conditions that permitted no intercommunion! A~~in&#xD;
and again his heart asked the question, so often, so un-&#xD;
availingly asked, "How" and "where" does he exist?&#xD;
"Is it under the same lineaments as heretofore? Or,&#xD;
as some believe, has his pure nature formed for itself a&#xD;
&#xD;
446&#xD;
&#xD;
'celestial b9dy,' only recognized by those who, in like&#xD;
manner, are clothed upon by indestructible qualities?&#xD;
Does the emancipated ~spirit move among those bright&#xD;
orbs above us, listening to melodies&#xD;
'Which,&#xD;
*         While this muddy vesture of decay&#xD;
Doth grossly close us in, we can not hear?'&#xD;
Is lie expanding under the teachings of those higher in.&#xD;
telligences whose sphere is Progress? Or, conforming to&#xD;
eternal harmonies, has he found his fittest place among&#xD;
those spirits like himself; whose ministration is love ?"&#xD;
ILost in these shadowy imaginings of a better world,&#xD;
he was recalled to the present by a tap at his door, and'&#xD;
a servant handed him a letter. It was from Mr. Mid-&#xD;
dleton, and the contents were as follows:&#xD;
"I choose this mode of communication because unfit,&#xD;
at present, for 'any other.&#xD;
"I am too sensible of the delicate forbearance with&#xD;
which you have refrained from all inquiries, to delay the&#xD;
information to which you are entitled. The confidence&#xD;
with' which I shall treat you. will be the best assurance&#xD;
of my affection, and my sense of your wrongs. Bear&#xD;
with me, then, while I enter into details of my life, with-&#xD;
out which my conduct can not be explained.&#xD;
"I was the only child of parents who, seeing in me&#xD;
the representative of an ancient and' opulent family,&#xD;
fortunately proportioned their indulgence to their esti-&#xD;
mate of my importance. This might not of itself have&#xD;
been fatal, had I not been exposed to ~t companionship&#xD;
that poisoned my mind and perverted my affections.&#xD;
"In the event of my death without issue, the inherit-&#xD;
ance was to pass to a cousin; about two years my senior.&#xD;

this reversionary claim, interested my parents. Instead&#xD;

of looking with a jealous 'eye on one who~e position&#xD;
might be supposed to engender an unfriendly feeling&#xD;
toward me, they generously resolved to educate him in&#xD;
such a manner as should fit him for the condition which&#xD;
Providence might possibly assign to him. Acting on&#xD;
this principle, he was invited to our house, and the same&#xD;
care and expense were bestowed on him as on myself.&#xD;
With a good appearance, a natural facility of manner,&#xD;
- and more than ordinary intelligence, Warren Talbot&#xD;
soon made himself so acceptable to my parents, that a&#xD;
limited invitation was extended to a permanent arrange..&#xD;
ment, and lie became' a member of our family. By&#xD;
a ready adaptation to my tastes or whims, he soon&#xD;
rendered himself indispensable to me. This was the&#xD;
beginning of an evil which parents more guarded&#xD;
would have seen* but I[ was happy, and they were sat..&#xD;
isfied.&#xD;
"Thus passed our boyhood, Talbot maintaining favor&#xD;
with his patrons by the most entire subservience and&#xD;
plausibility, and obtaining over me a control of which li&#xD;
was unconscious.&#xD;
"With years and increasing temptations his influence&#xD;
became greater and more dangerous. Every youthful&#xD;
folly he fostered; not by direct advice; lie was much&#xD;
too cunning for so false a step. By feeble Opposition he&#xD;
provoked my Will and stimulated the desire. The act&#xD;
committed, he reminded me' of his better counsel, and,&#xD;
at me time, contrived&#xD;
the' sa               to shelter me from the ef.&#xD;

"My father, in compliance with his own wish, pur-&#xD;
chased an ensign's commission f5 him. Not that he&#xD;
had any genuine military taste, but he had still less for&#xD;
the laborious study requisite for a learned profession.&#xD;

"My father's death left me master of a fortune, but,&#xD;
unhappily, not of myself. I was still the slave of Tal-&#xD;
bot; my time, my occupations, my resources, were under&#xD;
his control. Yet so admirably did his instinct of in-&#xD;
tense selfishness direct him, that, instead of resisting his&#xD;
power, I was flattered by the idea of my generous pro-&#xD;
tection of an unfortunate relative.&#xD;
"At length a marriage was negotiated for me. It was&#xD;
merely a union of two fine estates. The lady was hand-&#xD;
some, well-educated, and intelligent, and I had no con-&#xD;
'flicting preference. My mother urged it, because it&#xD;
would " increase my influence ;7~ and, in an evil hour&#xD;
for both, two young persons were led to an altar on&#xD;
which happiness and integrity were sacrificed. My&#xD;
poor mother did not survive to see the ruin she had pre-&#xD;

saved rue. My wife was truthful and high-minded, and,&#xD;
brief as had been our acquaintance, 'was really interested&#xD;
in me. lit was not long before she learned to distrust&#xD;
Talbot, and to dread his power over me. She ventured&#xD;
to caution me. My pride took the alarm, and he was&#xD;
too acute,, and had too much at stake, not to discover'&#xD;
the uneasiness between us, and the cause. But, with his&#xD;
usual adroitness, he turned it to his own account. He&#xD;
affected the most candid construction of her motives,&#xD;
and generously withdrew. He absented himself long&#xD;
enough to make his presence indispensable. He was&#xD;
recalled, and more firmly established than ever; and so&#xD;
magnanimous was his deportment, that, but for that in'&#xD;

coldness that repelled me. Thus we lived till your&#xD;
birth. Disappointed in her husband, she turned to her&#xD;
child, with such absorption as, at Talbot's suggestion,&#xD;
appeared an injury to myself; and an event that ought&#xD;
to. have drawn us together, only widened the breach.&#xD;
Availing himself of the alienation, he proposed a Conti-&#xD;
nental tour~ which your mother, hopeless of resisting his&#xD;
influence, did not oppose, and I left her in the conviction&#xD;
of her entire indifference.&#xD;
"Arrived in France, a whim took me to travel under&#xD;
a feigned name. Talbot, as usual, approved, and, enlarg-&#xD;
ing on my original idea, which was merely to escape the&#xD;
responsibilities that might attend on my real one-an&#xD;
annoyance to my constitution reserve-..--he represented&#xD;
me as unmarried. I, simply amused at his improvement~&#xD;
attached no importance to it, and we proceeded on our&#xD;
proposed route. After some time passed. in the south&#xD;
of France, Spain, and Italy, we went to Germany. My&#xD;
letters from home were 'few and brief-4ittle more than&#xD;
assurances of my child's health, and details of such af-&#xD;
fairs as had been entrusted to my wife~ No laments for&#xD;
my absence! no longings for my return! Why, indeed,&#xD;
should such have been? Even~were they felt, as I have&#xD;
now reason to believe, how could'a proud and neglected&#xD;
'wife utter them?&#xD;

"At a German watering-place we met a family whose&#xD;
manners and accomplishments attracted my attention, and&#xD;
we soon ascertained that their rank was in keeping with&#xD;
their appearance. I can not dwell on this event-the&#xD;
origin at once of my greatest ~happiness! my bitterest&#xD;
woe! Let it suffice that; in that family I met with the&#xD;
woman who first and forever fixed my love-my, la-&#xD;
menteci Theresa!. Even to you, son of a much-injured&#xD;
woman, I can not but hold this language, for you have&#xD;
seen her, and, from what she then was, can well im-&#xD;
agine her in the flower of youth! still more beautiful in&#xD;
mind and heart than in person.&#xD;
"At such plaQes acquaintance soon riper's into inti-&#xD;
macy. We met daily., hourly; our intercourse of that&#xD;
unceremonious, cordial character, which German simplic-&#xD;
ity and kindliness on her part, and the ~ecret security of&#xD;
a married man on mine, encouraged. Week after week&#xD;
I prolonged my stay; yet it was not till the day of sep-&#xD;
aration drew nigh that II was aware of the suffering it&#xD;
would cost me. To meet this, however, I called up ev-&#xD;
ery thing of manly and upright in my nature. Whatev-&#xD;
er might be my indifference to my wife, or the fascina-&#xD;
tions of Theresa, I was resolved not to~ violate duty to&#xD;
the one, nor attempt to secure, even were it possible, the&#xD;
sympathy of the other.&#xD;
"It would have been strange if Talbot, to whose anal-&#xD;
ysis I had so long been subjected, had not discovered&#xD;
the cause of my disturbance; and equally so' had he&#xD;
not turned it to his own ends. Dreading the influence&#xD;
my wife might yet obtain over me, supported by her&#xD;
child, his part was to make himself essential to me.&#xD;
In no way could this be so effectually done as by the&#xD;
unprincipled course he at once devised. Affecting the&#xD;
deepest sympathy with me, lamenting my unfortunate&#xD;
position, he then, with the utmost adroitness, insinuated&#xD;

'the coldness of my wife, her ample fortune independent&#xD;
of myself; the honorable position which my name and&#xD;
connections afforded her; that, by what the world called&#xD;
"desertion" II took nothing from her but that which she&#xD;
valued least-my person. The only consideration, there-&#xD;
fore, was what I myself would sacrifice or gain by fob&#xD;
lowing the dictates of my heart. This was for me to&#xD;
decide.'&#xD;
"But his sophistry did not blind me. I resisted; I&#xD;
didmore, I despised it, and quarreled with him outright.&#xD;
In reply to my reproaches of his perfidious counsels he&#xD;
humbled himself; pleaded his devotion to my happiness,&#xD;
and made his peace.&#xD;
"We were about to depart. My trunks were packed;&#xD;
every preparation made. I went to take leave, and,&#xD;
whil4 I waited the entrance of Theresa, most unhappily&#xD;
overheard a conversation in an adjoining room, between&#xD;
her mother and sister, which left me no doubt that the&#xD;
sentiment I entertained for her was reciprocated. At&#xD;
this moment, when my brain and heart were on fire with&#xD;
the discovery, she appeared. The effort she made to&#xD;
seem calm only confirmed what I had just heard. Pru-&#xD;
dence, duty, honor, were forgotten! and; instead of the&#xD;
leave-taking for which I had gone, we parted after a mu-&#xD;
tual avowal of affection, and a solemn promise to meet.&#xD;
again, and forever!&#xD;
"The die was cast. Intoxicated by my passion, I per-&#xD;
suaded myself that nothing now remained but to carry&#xD;
out that which destiny had cast upon me. I no longer&#xD;
resisted Talbot. I invited his false and treacherous ad-&#xD;
vice; and, stifling every emotion but love, triumphant&#xD;
love! I surrendered myself into his hands-and the&#xD;
woman I adored, whose purity and unconscious in-&#xD;
nocence I worshiped, I basely betrayed by an illegal&#xD;
marriage I Animated by a sentiment as strong, and far&#xD;

&#xD;
more holy than my own, she hesitated at no sacrifice,&#xD;
but consented to go with me immediately to America,&#xD;
reasons for which were easily manufactured by Talbot&#xD;
-the principal, a family rupture, which accounted not&#xD;
only for present separation, but for the perpetual es-&#xD;
trangement to follow.&#xD;
"We came. It would be a treason to Virtue that I&#xD;
will not perpetrate to say that I was happy. There&#xD;
were, indeed, moments of delirious felicity, when I for-&#xD;
got every thing. But even then I paid her ai~ involun.-&#xD;
tary homage, by rejoicing in the angelic innocence which&#xD;
continually reproached me.&#xD;
"My assumed name, and the precautions taken by&#xD;
Talbot, sufficiently concealed the place of my retreat.&#xD;
"He returned to England, and contrived to elude sus-&#xD;
picion of his participation in my guilt. He was prob-&#xD;
ably believed by all but my wife. Her c~aduct was&#xD;
marked by the same dignified forbearance. She did not&#xD;
attempt to penetrate my disguise, nor to follow me with&#xD;
reproaches. I was as much lost to her as if the grave&#xD;
had closed over me. But her child remained, and filled&#xD;
the heart my baseness would have made a desert.&#xD;
"The devices of Talbot were not yet exhausted. There&#xD;
was still to be perpetrated another villainy, by which to&#xD;
bind me to him. I am willing to believe that the orig-&#xD;
inal impulse to the unprincipled act was to relieve me,&#xD;
though, when committed, he quickly saw how available&#xD;
it mightbe to himself. He knew that, though I did not&#xD;
regret my wife; that, though I had steeled myself against&#xD;
all considerations of country and the duties of my posi-&#xD;
tion, there were yet moments wh~n the loss of my son,&#xD;
of my only legitimate offspring, and the contempt and&#xD;
abhorrence in which he would be trained to regard me,&#xD;
weigli~d on my spirit~-when I felt that the ruin I had&#xD;
'wrought was to descend on me in the shape I could least&#xD;

well bear-when paroxysms of remorse rendered me al..&#xD;
most a maniac.&#xD;
"It was in sttch a moment that he overwhelmed me by&#xD;
telling me that my child was in this country! Under&#xD;
the same sky with myself!&#xD;
"The conflict into which I was thrown by this com-&#xD;
munication is not to be described. The outrage to my&#xD;
wife absorbed every other feeling. Every personal con-&#xD;
sideration vainly struggled against the irreparable, the&#xD;
aggravated injury inflicted on her. But here again the&#xD;
tempter, in the shape of Talbot; was at hand: 'She be-&#xD;
lieved him dead. A careless nurse had left him at plays&#xD;
on the border of a stream that watered the grounds-.----&#xD;
the opportunity had been ~seized-the child carried off,&#xD;
and his hat cast in the river to suggest that he had fallen&#xD;
in.) Meanwhile, Talbot, not known by her to have been&#xD;
in England at the time, with that facility which some-&#xD;
times attends the wicked, as if to damn them by sue.&#xD;
cess, was bearing the child acrQss the ocean while his&#xD;
mother bewailed him as drowned.&#xD;
"'But the injury,' he argued, 'to her was temporary.&#xD;
The death of a young child was an ordinary calamity.&#xD;
" Time, the consoler" was already having its effect. Thc&#xD;
relief to myself was permanent, and the benefit to the&#xD;
child greater than could be estimated. Instead of un-&#xD;
limited indulgence, the victim of a desolate wife's dot-&#xD;
ing fondness, and then of his own vices~ he might here&#xD;
be trained in a wholesome simpliefty, and under proper&#xD;
restraint. When these had done their work, he could,&#xD;
if I so chose, be restored to his mother-.---grateful to the&#xD;
father who had rescued him from the seductions her&#xD;
love would have spread around him. He, Talbot,. had,&#xD;
however, he must own, been moved to do what he Jiad&#xD;
done mainly by regard for my happiness.&#xD;
"The considerations afi~cting my son's character had&#xD;
&#xD;
A. ~EI~i' AT TIIJ~ PAST.         455&#xD;
&#xD;
their influence. I shuddered at a repetition of the weak&#xD;
indulgence that had wrecked my fame and peace, and II&#xD;
submitted to what seemed inevitable. The best arrange-&#xD;
ment to be made for him was next to be decided. To&#xD;
introduce him into my family was impossible. I must,&#xD;
then, seek elsewhere for the protection and guidance&#xD;
that could not be extended to him under my own roof;&#xD;
for which, in my perplexity and agitation, I declared&#xD;
that I was ready to make any amount of compensation&#xD;
-of course, as I could not encounter the risk of dis.&#xD;
cover, to pass through Talbot's hands. Here, undoubt-&#xD;
edly, the temptation to his subsequent villainy insinu-&#xD;
ated itself. This I infer from the fact that measures&#xD;
were taken from the first to prevent all direct communi-&#xD;
cation, however secret, between my child and myself.&#xD;
I was deceived as to the name he bore, that of the per-&#xD;
son to whom he was intrusted, and even the place where&#xD;
he lived. How Talbot had heard of Mr. Grafton I have&#xD;
no means of knowing amid all this mystification. But&#xD;
I can well believe that, to a man like him, the slightest&#xD;
allusion to a person whose character and seclusion were&#xD;
just what he wanted, would not be lost; and, as he&#xD;
never failed in effrontery, his application does not sur-&#xD;
prise me.&#xD;
"Talbot kept up his relations with England; I, of&#xD;
course, had none, but such as were necessary to secure&#xD;
and receive my revenues, for which he was my agent.&#xD;
He wandered about, leading, as he said, a bachelor's&#xD;
life; while I, in retirement, knew only of his movements&#xD;
and pursuits what he chose to reveal. From time to&#xD;
time he gave nte satisfactory intelligence of my son, and&#xD;
rendered such accounts as were convenient to himself&#xD;
of the d sbursements for his benefit.&#xD;

ed us deeply, though differently. To the mother sor.&#xD;
row brought 'airs from heaven,' that breathed into her&#xD;
so~il intimations of a better world, where she should re-&#xD;
join them. To me it was a 'blast from hell,' burning&#xD;
into ray spirit a sentence of condemnation and eternal&#xD;
separation.&#xD;
"At length occurred our visit to Lebanon, where I&#xD;
was to behold my unknown first-born. I remember&#xD;
well the moment of meeting, because the name of&#xD;
'Walter' struck me. It was that of my son, and I saw&#xD;
.with some interest the boy who bore it. Talbot had&#xD;
probably permitted you to retain it in order to secure&#xD;
your childish confidence. But so effectual had been his&#xD;
precautions that no suspicion crossed my mind. Yet,&#xD;
though not bearing a marked resemblance to any one&#xD;
of my family, you were sufficiently of that type to recMl&#xD;
it, and. I sometimes wondered 'who it was of whom you&#xD;
reminded me!' Other things, however, inspired me with&#xD;
a regard for you, which I would gladly have proved.&#xD;
An opportunity offered, but, like every good purpose&#xD;
of mine, my evil genius was at hand to prevent it. An&#xD;
application on your behalf came from Mr. Grafton. I&#xD;
was ill in bed, and Talbot by my side. I was unable to&#xD;
use my eyes, and he read the letter for me; and on my&#xD;
regretting ray inability tQ reply immediately, he offered&#xD;
to write at my dictation, lie appeared to do so. I re-&#xD;
quested you to make my house your home, while I&#xD;
should use my best endeavors for you. For this he&#xD;
substituted what he pleased. I am not surprised at the&#xD;
reception you gave his letter.&#xD;
"In addition to the usual remittances designed for&#xD;
you, but as I now know never receiv&amp;amp;l, he contrived&#xD;
to obtain money on your account under various pre-&#xD;
texts. On one occasion, 'the excellent man' with whom&#xD;
he ~stated you to be living,' a country clergyman with a&#xD;
&#xD;
small salary, had met with what to him was a heavy pe-&#xD;
cuniary loss;' and he urged so forcibly the making you&#xD;
the medium of relief to him, that I gave him a draft for&#xD;
the amount required. At another time you 'had un-&#xD;
wittingly fallen among sharpers, and had been cheated&#xD;
out of nearly a year's allowance. You were a minor,&#xD;
and might thus evade the payment, but the effect on&#xD;
your own mind would be bad: it was, after all, a youth-&#xD;
ftil indiscretion,' etc. Without waiting farther argu-&#xD;
ment I advanced the money.&#xD;
"By similar devices, and the representations of your&#xD;
naturally increasing wants, you will perceive how im-&#xD;
portant to the vampire was his hold on me. At the&#xD;
same time, you will wonder at a fatuity so gross as hard-&#xD;
ly to be believed-at such confidence in a man whose&#xD;
loose morality must have been apparent. But you must&#xD;
recollect that, besides an original fatal facility on my part,&#xD;
which these disclosures sufficiently betray, I could not&#xD;
afford4o distrust him. He had my dearest secret in his&#xD;
keeping. A word or look that suggested a doubt to&#xD;
Theresa would destroy us both! Never, therefore, did&#xD;
man more earnestly desire to believe in the faith of his&#xD;
wife than did I in that of Talbot. Another considera-&#xD;
tion held me in his power with a sort of fascination.&#xD;
He was the only being to whom I could be truel To&#xD;
the angel who lay in my bosom I was habitually a hyp-&#xD;
ocrite; to this man, the incarnation of falsehood, I could&#xD;
speak the truth!&#xD;
"It may naturally be asked, as time passed on, what&#xD;
plans I had formed for you? None. With an imbe-&#xD;
cile indecision-the result of the labyrinth in which I&#xD;
had involved myself-I made no provision for a future&#xD;
I dared not think of quieting my perplexities by The&#xD;
reflection that, in the event of my death, you must suc-&#xD;

"From Mr. Grafton I learned his design against Miss&#xD;
~Meredith~ It was in keeping with his whole life.&#xD;
Though incapable of love, he was not insensible to beau~&#xD;
~ty, and he wanted money. He would not, therefore, hes-&#xD;
itate to secure her by fraud, confident of powers that had&#xD;
~never yet failed him to make his peace afterward. He&#xD;
had the saixke reliance on these that some men have on&#xD;
their 'star.' This is observable in his conduct toward&#xD;
you, the particulars of which I have obtained from Mr.&#xD;
*I~frafton. He never doubted his ability to delude you;&#xD;
to keep you in check, as by an unseen hand; to coun-&#xD;
teract you in the dark; to mystify and to intimidate;&#xD;
and thus to maintain his strange hold upon you. His&#xD;
~apparent success justified his presumption. Your first&#xD;
attempt at emancipation he defeated, as he believed, by&#xD;
the substituted letter. He then left New York for a&#xD;
time; and though, on his return, he found you there,&#xD;
the threat that followed you to .Ashton seemed to have&#xD;
its effect, for you did not reappear in the city. When&#xD;
he discovered your relations with Mr. Meredith, and you&#xD;
wer~ met by a still sterner mandate, you instantly de-&#xD;
parted. Again, as Mr. Grafton believes, he crossed your&#xD;
path in the woods of Rosenberg, and again, to all ap-&#xD;
pearance, you retreated, as if conscious of your inability&#xD;
to struggle against him. Thus confirmed in his self-con.&#xD;
fidence, and always on his guard, I doubt if; by word or&#xD;
look,~ he ever permitted it to appear to ±he Merediths&#xD;
that he was conscious such a person as Walter Thornley&#xD;
existed.&#xD;
"But, triumphant as had been his artifices, they reached&#xD;
their limit. A transaction, not connected with you, ex-&#xD;
cited my suspicion.. I asked for an explanation, which&#xD;
wa~ not satisfactory, and we parted, on bad terms. This&#xD;

was immediately after the death of Theresa. Had she&#xD;
still lived it would not have happened; for, strange to&#xD;
say, she, his victim not less than mine, was a link be-&#xD;
tween us. I would have submitted to be cheated and&#xD;
trampled or~ forever, rather than rouse him to disturb&#xD;
her repose. I ought, too, in justice, to say that, such&#xD;
was his reverence for her-the only pure sentiment in&#xD;
his breast-that he would unwillingly have inflicted&#xD;
misery on her.&#xD;
"This restraint removed, his tactics were now changed;&#xD;
and, perceiving my growing distrust, he resolved to leave&#xD;
me to my fate, and propitiate you and your mother. To&#xD;
this course he was the more impelled by a letter from&#xD;
England, threatening him with disgraceful disclosuTes.&#xD;
unless a certain sum, long due, were paid by a given&#xD;
time. This letter, found in his port-folio, had no signa-&#xD;
ture except initials, to me unintelligible. I mention this&#xD;
fact, apparently unimportant, from its bearing on what&#xD;
afterward occurred. He resolved on an immediate re~&#xD;
turn to England, there to restore you to your mother, as&#xD;
having been cared for and saved by himself, out of which&#xD;
he was, of course, to make his profit; charging me, no&#xD;
doubt, with your abduction, and he neglect in which&#xD;
you were subsequently left. I, meanwhile, ignorant of&#xD;
these allegations, and, if suspecting his previous frauds,&#xD;
unable to prove them, could neither defend myself nor&#xD;
inculpate him. This move had plainly been his 'strong&#xD;
card,' to be resorted to on any emergency.&#xD;
"It may, perhaps, be wondered why a man so unscru-&#xD;
pulous had not played a deeper game-you only being&#xD;
between him and my estate, and you in his power. To&#xD;
me this is easily explained. His course had been shaped&#xD;
by circumstances, not an originally concerted plan; and,&#xD;
while continually entangling himself more and more in&#xD;
falsehood and depredation, it is evident that he expect-&#xD;

There is no trickery of which he was not capable. He&#xD;
was a manoouvrer 'en amateur. As in art to an artist,&#xD;
so, to him, in morals, 'the curved line was the line of&#xD;
beauty.' But he had not the courage for great crime.&#xD;
His was the temper of a subtle scoundrel, not the nerve&#xD;
of a relentless villain.&#xD;
"And now comes the crisis of our fate. The judg-&#xD;
ment of God overtook him when he felt most confident&#xD;
of success! and Mr. Grafton came to lay before me doc-&#xD;
uments which implicated me, without clearly defining to&#xD;
what extent. Of our interview you have heard what&#xD;
was necessary. at the' time. 'I 'can not go over moments&#xD;
of such'humiliation. I admitted, without hesitation, the&#xD;
parentage of a soi;of Whom any father might be proud,&#xD;

doubting your ac4uiescence in his plan, and sure that&#xD;
he should follow his letter immediately, he ventured on&#xD;
the bold step of confiding to him your existence, and your&#xD;
supposed name, with his own pretended claims upon you&#xD;
-just what, without committing himself; would secure&#xD;
the forbearance of his creditor. The same ship that car-&#xD;
ried the letter conveyed the news of Talbot's death, and&#xD;
the man, deprived of farther reliance on him, immediate-&#xD;
ly communicated its contents to your mother.&#xD;
"The appearance of Mr. Bolton is now explained. I&#xD;
have only to add to these details-all, in some sQrt, nec-&#xD;

cursed thing-~---touoh me noii lest you die! I am the&#xD;
deadly tree, under whose shade happiness can not live;&#xD;
whose bitter fruit has been guilt andwoe; whose wounds&#xD;
distill poison; and from which even the blessed dews&#xD;
of heaven, descending, are converted into drops that&#xD;
scald~as they fall. Be warned, and leave me!&#xD;
"Do not, Walter, regard this as a burst of passion,&#xD;
* wrung from me in the exasperation of the moment. It&#xD;
is the conviction of my reason. My conduct must be so&#xD;
repellent to a nature truthful as yours, as to create a&#xD;
barrier which even duty can not surmount; and 11am&#xD;
still too proud to owe to compassion what Ii can not&#xD;
command from respect. I feel that the conflict of my&#xD;
life has made its impression on my health. What of&#xD;
time remains to me 11 would make, in some small degree,&#xD;
an atonement for the past. You need not be told that&#xD;
your first duty is to your mother. My wish, so~far as&#xD;
I have a right to express one, is that you hasten to her.&#xD;
&#xD;
She and you must decide your future plans. She will,&#xD;
of course, retain you in England, and form for you such&#xD;
connections as will, I trust, promote your happiness.&#xD;
My resources are at your command in any way that you&#xD;
shall suggest.                 GODFREY CECIL."&#xD;
The humble, broken, yet proud spirit that spoke in&#xD;
this letter, affected Walter with a contrariety of emo-&#xD;
tions: condemnation that he could not but feel; pity&#xD;
that he did not . attempt to repress; indignation and&#xD;
wonder at such a tissue of folly, selfishness, ra~hness,&#xD;
and crime! Yet he could not be unmindful of the con-&#xD;
stant, though fruitless efforts of his father for his benefit.&#xD;
One thought, however, absorb~A all others. "If sym-&#xD;
pathy were ever called for, it was,~' he reflected, "when&#xD;
the soul, conscious of wrong, sought .the right-when,&#xD;
sore in the war of passion, remorse, and pride, it required&#xD;
healing-when, in its utter self-abasement, its faith in&#xD;
the reality of virtue needed to be quickened. But he&#xD;
would not, could not write !" Starting from his chair,&#xD;
he hastened from the room, and ventured to appear un-&#xD;
called in his father's presence.&#xD;
There it is scarcely well to follow him. A parent&#xD;
humbling himself before his child-entreaties for for-&#xD;
giveness mingling with self-denunciations-his whole&#xD;
heart exposed and prostrate-is too painful and too sa-&#xD;
cred to be trifled with by inadequate description. It is&#xD;
enough to say that tl~e generous purpose of Walter pre-&#xD;
vailed; that so tenderly, yet so uprightly, did he deal&#xD;
with his father, and so entirely did he convince him of&#xD;
his filial sentiment, that confidence was established be-&#xD;
tween them.&#xD;
"It was his own desire," he assured him, "to be&#xD;
guided by him in all things." To this he added a re-&#xD;
quest to defer the recognition of their relationship, till&#xD;
his return from England..&#xD;

"There has been," he said, "enough of agitation. Let&#xD;
us be spared at present from curious eyes and tongues.&#xD;
It is sufficient that we have no reserves-..-that we under;&#xD;
stand each other. So far as the world has any concern&#xD;

CHAPTER XLV.&#xD;
A FORTNIGHT had elapsed since Walter's last visit to&#xD;
the Oaks. In the mean time, through Mr. Grafton, he&#xD;
had learned of Eleanor's grief and dejection, which that&#xD;
gentleman, imputing entirely to a cause which only in&#xD;
part explained it, and misunderstanding the relations&#xD;
that had subsisted between him and Eleanor, conceived&#xD;
it well to represent 'in as strong language as truth would&#xD;
permit. "lit would," he reflected, "effectually damp&#xD;
any lingering hope, if such still existed, and better nerve&#xD;
him for the new career on which he was to enter; leav-&#xD;
ing his mind free to gratify the wishes that his mother&#xD;
might form for him, and thus enable him to promote the&#xD;
happiness of a parent to whose wrongs so much was&#xD;
due."&#xD;
On the occasion of Walter's last hasty call, he had&#xD;
made it so evident to Eleanor that his only wish was to&#xD;
see Mr. Grafton, as to pain and surprise her. Pride,&#xD;
however, came to her relief.&#xD;
"Well," thought she, "if he prefers, for some unex-&#xD;
plained reason, to withdraw even his friendship, so be it.&#xD;
He shall see that I regret it as little as himself."&#xD;
But the sorrow called forth by the death of Oscar-~ ~&#xD;
natural, unconscious, and therefore freely manifested.-&#xD;
unnerved her. It was the first breach made in the&#xD;
youthful circle-her first view of the Destroyer! and&#xD;
her susceptible nature fainted and shivered under the&#xD;
revelation. "Ah! who does not remember the time&#xD;
when the stern fact of mortality broke in upon the gay&#xD;
fancies of youth !" It was not strange that emotions so~&#xD;
strong should have been misinterpreted, nor that the&#xD;

\&#xD;
&#xD;
sadness that succeeded, however compounded with oth-&#xD;
er feelings, should be referred to the same cause.&#xD;
Walter, on whose heart l4y the trust that Oscar had&#xD;
imposed in regard to Eleano~, had delayed to discharge&#xD;
it in the desire to obtain thc~ calmness and self-posses-&#xD;
sion required. But circumstances pressed upon him.&#xD;
The voyage to England was decided; his preparations&#xD;
were nearly completed; and, having no longer time nor&#xD;
excuse for procrastination, he ordered his horse, and,&#xD;
mounting him with somewhat the feeling of going into&#xD;
mortal conflict, turned his course to the Oaks.&#xD;
Eleanor had been passing the morning with her aunt,&#xD;
~when Mr. Grafton entered with a note from Mr. Middle.&#xD;
ton. Drawing his wife a little apart, they conversed a&#xD;
few moments in a suppressed tone, Eleanor unheeding&#xD;
till the name of Thornley fell on her ear, followed by&#xD;
the words; "Sails for England in a few days." The&#xD;
matter of the conversation was evidently private; nor&#xD;
eduld she, if permitted~ then have asked a question.&#xD;
ILer only resource was to fly; and, shutting herself in&#xD;
her own room, tears that pride could not restrain burst&#xD;
forth.&#xD;
"Yes," she exclaimed, "he is going, perhaps, forever!&#xD;
and not a line, not a word of regret, nor even of informa-&#xD;
tion. how is he estranged I To England! What can'&#xD;
take him there? Business of Mr. Middleton's? But&#xD;
no matter. I'Ve, his first friends, are now nothing; this&#xD;
strange, disagreeable Mr. Middleton every thing," added&#xD;
she, petulantly. Then, her frank and generous nature&#xD;
more ~grieved than offended, she continued, "I could not&#xD;
so treat a friend. Where I had once given my confi-&#xD;
dence I could not withdraw it without cause."&#xD;
Phyllis tapped at the door, and was reluctantly ad-&#xD;
mitted."&#xD;

"Oh," cried Eleanor, "I can not-I will not see him&#xD;
now. 'Tis impossible," she continued, catching a view&#xD;
of her face in ~n opposite mirror-" impossible !"&#xD;
Never waiting for second thoughts, Phyllis, as usual,&#xD;
rushed down stairs, and met Walter alighting at the door&#xD;
with an inquiry for Miss Meredith.&#xD;
A country-bred girl,' untrained as yet to the polite&#xD;
qualifications by which those better taught know how&#xD;
to soften the refusal of city dames to shine upon their&#xD;
worshipers, Phyllis dropped a courtesy, and answered&#xD;
without circumlocution.&#xD;
"My missis say, sar, she won't come down."&#xD;
Walter, with a look of surprise, inquired if she were ill.&#xD;
"No, sar," replied she, with much composure; "she&#xD;
~7&#xD;
bery well-on'y she say she don't want to see you, sar..&#xD;
"Did she say so?"&#xD;
"Sartin, ear1" replied. the aifrouted. little femme tie&#xD;
c/tam/ire. "I neber tell no lies."&#xD;
"Does she see any body ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sar; be sure. All de gen'elmen and ladies&#xD;
what come."&#xD;
"Ionly, then, am excluded," thought he, and butfor&#xD;
the errand on which he came, he would have immediate-&#xD;
ly departed. trust the accuracy of Dhll~ with a&#xD;
Not choosing to                   xylS&#xD;
v~rl~al message, he wrote on a card, "My visit is one of&#xD;
necessity; be so good as to see me for a few moments;"&#xD;
and, committing this to her, waited in no very patient&#xD;
mood an answer.&#xD;
In a moment she returned, and was leading him to&#xD;
the parlor; but, hearing voices, and his interview requir-&#xD;
ing to be private, he entered the open. door of the study,&#xD;
saying he would await he~ mistress there.&#xD;

*46$         WALTER TIIORNLEY; OR,                                         A i~E33a' AT TilE rAST.     469&#xD;
&#xD;
Eleanoi', scarce conscious of the words that had es-&#xD;
caped her, and little imagining them to be reported to&#xD;
Walter, saw only in. the line addressed to her the same&#xD;
pertinacious avoidance of any personal attention. Ths~&#xD;
pleasure at this lack of common courtesy overcame oth..&#xD;
or feelings, and she felt at once quite strong enough to&#xD;
meet him.&#xD;
She descended, and, at the foot of the stairs, met&#xD;
Phyllis with an apology, "De gen'elxnan would go in&#xD;
de wrong room," pointing to the study; "no fault of&#xD;
mine, missis."&#xD;
"Rather any where else," thought Eleanor; "but if&#xD;
he can bear it so will I." And she entered, so calm&#xD;
and cold that, but for the traces of recent tears, she&#xD;
might have seemed incapable of feeling.&#xD;
Under this exterior, however, Walter, though mis-&#xD;
taking the cause, saw and felt the sorrow, andthemo-&#xD;
mentary pique was gone. Approaching her with a soft-&#xD;
ened though still a constrained manner, he extended his&#xD;
hand; hers trembled, but she permitted him to lead her&#xD;
to a chair, and he took one b~31i~r~side.&#xD;
"Forgive me," said he, "if I appear importunate. I&#xD;
would not obtrude myself on you~but that a sacred duty&#xD;
requires it."&#xD;
Eleanor looked in silence and surprise, inwardly re-&#xD;
peating, "Importunate! obtrude I What language to&#xD;
me!"&#xD;
"And, now that I am permitted to see and speak to&#xD;
you, I scarcely know how to introduce a subject so pain..&#xD;
fiil to us both. Strange that we should feel such reluct-&#xD;
ance to name those most dear to us, when death has&#xD;
come between us 1"&#xD;
No word from Eleanor smoothed the way, and he&#xD;
continued, after a pause, in which his troubled look&#xD;
only added to her perplexity.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oscar," at length he said, "may I not say our Os-&#xD;
car ?" and again he paused, with a fixed, inquiring glance,&#xD;
till, feeling herself called on to reply, she said; i1~i a sad&#xD;
but quiet voice, "Certainly; why should you doubt it?"&#xD;
Her calmness reassured him; and, taking Oscar's let-&#xD;
*ter from his pocket, he read that portion which related&#xD;
to herself.&#xD;
She listened without a word; but the varying expres-&#xD;
sion of her truthful face, in which astonishment, pain,&#xD;
and wounded delicacy were reflected, was more eloquent'&#xD;
than words.&#xD;
"This can not be new to you," said Walter, in his&#xD;
turn surprised and perplexed. "Your own feelings must&#xD;
have prepared you, in some degree, for a communication&#xD;
so natural under the. circumstances.. Perhaps there may&#xD;
be somewhat left unsaid at a moment of great bodily&#xD;
weakness-allow me to be more explicit." And he pro-&#xD;
ceeded to explain the silence of Oscar; to enlarge on&#xD;
the love that had rendered it so difficult; the honor&#xD;
that could alone have enabled him to maintain it. He&#xD;
would have said even more, but Eleanor, having recov-&#xD;
ered from the first effect of a revelation so little expect-&#xD;
ed, interrupted him.&#xD;
"You, have discharged your trust. That is enough, so&#xD;
far as you are concerned. For myself I must be allow-&#xD;
ed a few words. I can not tell to what extent you may&#xD;
impute inconsistency to me, but my own conscience ac-&#xD;
quits me. I have never felt, nor intentionally manifest-&#xD;
ed, any thing for your friend that a sister might not feel&#xD;
for a brother, whose peculiarly delicate nature called&#xD;
for more than common sympathy. My first feeling at&#xD;
this communication, I will own, was displeasure at being&#xD;
thus mistaken and addressed---but it is passed. If the&#xD;
delusion were a happy one to~ him-whose fate I truly&#xD;
lament-I do not complain. To him it matters not now&#xD;

&#xD;
-.and as little to me; for, if the living condemn me, my&#xD;
own heart does not."&#xD;
Walter did not attempt a reply. Never had he more&#xD;
deeply felt her truth, dignity, and generosity; but the&#xD;
sentiment could find no expression. No longer restrain~&#xD;
ed by consideration for another-friendship and love no&#xD;
longer in confiict-~-the charge of fickleness and levity&#xD;
which his heart had secretly brought against her now&#xD;
withdrawn-~-the hope of earlier days would not be d&amp;amp;&#xD;
nied. Yet the uninviting manner of Eleanor repressed&#xD;
all utterance. He tried 'to speak, 'but his words were&#xD;
indistinct.' And she, little propifiated by his earnest rep-&#xD;
resentation of the love of another, rose, and said; coldly,&#xD;
"From the short conference you requested, your tfrne&#xD;
must be much occupied; pray, do not let me longer de-&#xD;
tain you."&#xD;
All the pride. of'Walter would, at any other time, have&#xD;
risen at this speech; but now, gentler feelings were in&#xD;
the ascendant.&#xD;
With increasing agitation, and in a voice tremulous&#xD;
with emotion, while his eye sought the depths of hers,&#xD;
he exclaimed, "You must not leave me thus-misap-&#xD;
prehension shall not part us! Dearest Eleanor, may J,&#xD;
dare I open to you a heart that has never ceased to be&#xD;
yours,?"&#xD;
Pride, wounded affection, displeasure, at these few&#xD;
words, fled as by magic. She started, the blood rushed&#xD;
to her, cheek; a doubtful look for a moment seemed to&#xD;
repel him; she half-resisted the movement that sought&#xD;
again to reseat, her; a word of rebuke wa~ ready. to fall&#xD;
from her lips; but they melted into a smile that gave&#xD;
the permission he 'asked.&#xD;
As ha proceeded, however, it was apparent to her up-&#xD;
right ,mina that, he was transgressing~ the limit they&#xD;
ouglat tQ. observee; and, rising' hastily, ~she said, "I can&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
hear no more. I did, indeed, desire to be assured of&#xD;
your friendship. You have satisfied me; I shall never&#xD;
again distrust it. Let us part for the present; it is best."&#xD;
Walter, it is hoped, will be forgiven, if he, after the&#xD;
manner. of men, seeking to be loved for his own sake,&#xD;
maintained, even at this moment, his incognito.&#xD;
"Eleanor," said he, "you once believed in me, when&#xD;
honor compelled me to be silent; believe me now, when&#xD;
I dare to speak. Your parents, as I know prom their&#xD;
own declaration, desire chiefly your happiness; and, if&#xD;
assured that I shall bring you neither poverty nor dis-&#xD;
grace, they will not reject me. My present condition war-&#xD;
rants this assertion. Others might offer you.a more dis-&#xD;
tinguished position, and 'wealth beyond the dream of&#xD;
avarice;' but, if love is better than riches and honor,&#xD;
where is the treasure larger than that which my heart&#xD;
has 'garnered up' for you? Will you cast it from you ?"&#xD;
Her beaming eyes, full of things i~nutterable, answer-&#xD;
ed for her. Her extended hand grasped in his, pressed&#xD;
to his lips and heart, sealed the compact, while a sweet,&#xD;
low voice was heard to say, "Your love, a~id the sanc~&#xD;
tion of my parents, is all I ask."&#xD;
Aid Walter, did not your conscience smite you that&#xD;
you had dared to apply a touch-stone to that true young&#xD;
heart? Or, rat her, did not a thrill of joy, exquisite, if&#xD;
selfish, acknowledge this~ frank avowal that you, with-&#xD;
out fortune or distinction, unknown and obscure, that&#xD;
you, simply Walter Thornley, were the "star of her des-&#xD;
tiny?"&#xD;
What followed iii that t~te-ei-ft~te, or, to use the more&#xD;
beautiful expression of the Italians, quattr'occhi, may be&#xD;
easily diyined-the same review of the past, the same&#xD;
tracing to its first spring in their hearts of that stream&#xD;
which "never did run smooth," the same lingering on&#xD;
moments of bliss, the same explanations of doubts and&#xD;

At length they parted, with many delays, and much&#xD;
"sweet sorrow."&#xD;
Phyllis, ever on the alert when her young mistress&#xD;
was concerned, had taken up her position in the hallin&#xD;
order to open the door to the "gen'elman," whose visit,&#xD;
judging from his reception, she decided would not be&#xD;
very long. It was so protracted, however, that curiosi-&#xD;
ty, more than propriety, held her to her p6st; nor did&#xD;
she fail to make her own inferences. "Well," thought&#xD;

CHAPTER XLVI.&#xD;
As Eleanor retired to her room at night, Phyllis pre-&#xD;
sented herself; with a large packet, brought, as she said,&#xD;
by Mr. Middleton's "sarvent, and on'y for young missis'&#xD;
own hands."&#xD;
Her happiness too great for any addition, Eleanor's&#xD;
first sensation was alarm, and she received it with some&#xD;
trepidation. A letter from Walter relieved her. It in-&#xD;
closed one from Mr. Middleton to himself, which ran as&#xD;
follows:&#xD;
"My DEAR WALTER, - I thank you for the confi-&#xD;
dance reposed in me, frank and manly as yourself.&#xD;
Nothing could, at this moment, give me such satisfaction&#xD;
as the information in regard to Miss Meredith.&#xD;
"You urge, in so far as she and her family are concern-&#xD;
ed, the necessity of departing from the reserve you had&#xD;
proposed. This is obvious. And I must, in justice to&#xD;
myself; say that I had already determined not to avail&#xD;
myself of your delicate consideration, though, at the mo-&#xD;
ment of its suggestion, I was too much touched to dis-&#xD;
cuss, or to resist it. I prefer that the truth be known at&#xD;
once. When the lives and happiness of those dearest&#xD;
to me were at stake, I was a coward. Alone, I can bear&#xD;
all that I deserve. The contumely of the world, much&#xD;
as at one time it would have stung me, will now fall&#xD;
on a heart so wrung with sorrow, so penetrated by re-&#xD;
morse, as to be nearly insensible to what man can say.&#xD;
Make what use you please of my written communication&#xD;
to you.                                 G. C,,&#xD;

&#xD;
With this preface Eleanor 'opened the packet-.the&#xD;
"communication" alluded to-of which Walter's letter&#xD;
authorized the perusal.&#xD;
With what feelings it was read-with what mm led&#xD;
indignation and compassion on the one hand, and rejoic-&#xD;
ing, free from all selfIsh considerations, on the other, may&#xD;
be imagined.&#xD;
- An early hour the next morning brought Walter;&#xD;
who, after an interview with Mr. Grafton, was introduced&#xD;
by him to Mr. and Mrs. Meredith as bearing a name,&#xD;
having a position, and, moreover, preferring a suit, which&#xD;
altogether astonished them. The courtesy with which&#xD;
he was heard and accepted can not be doubted. Yet it&#xD;
is but justice to say. that the estimate they, had formed&#xD;
of him, under circumstances so different, entered largely&#xD;
into the feeling with which their assent was accorded.&#xD;
Mr. Grafton, of course, was delighted; his wife scarce-&#xD;
ly less so; it only remained to be assured of the appro-&#xD;
bation of Mr. Lawrence, and Mrs. Meredith forthwith&#xD;
asked admittance to his room.&#xD;
She found him in a favorable mood. He listened&#xD;
with: complacency to the picture she drew of youthful&#xD;
lo~ve, honorable forbearance, constancy, etc.; but when&#xD;
she proceeded to the strange turn of fortune by which&#xD;
they had met their reward, enlarging on the wealth and&#xD;
social position that had so unexpectedly been disclosed,&#xD;
and then to the startling facts connected therewith, ac-&#xD;
companied by ill-advised though well-intended exple-&#xD;
tives, of "poor Mr. Middleton !" his "trials,"" unfortu-&#xD;
nate . temptations," "peculiar circumsI~ances," etc., Mr.&#xD;
Lawrence's countenance darkened.&#xD;
Striking his cane violently on the ground, he exclaim-&#xD;
Qd, ~' Janet, I'm. ashamed of you! You have a right to&#xD;
rn~ny your daughter as you please, and, should I ap-&#xD;
prove or not, of course you'll do so. I love the girl,&#xD;
&#xD;
and shall love her, let. her marry whom she may. I've&#xD;
had enough of crossing hearts. If you had given her to&#xD;
young Thornley, as you called him, an obscure country&#xD;
lad, however surprised, I should have said nothing; nay,&#xD;
shouldn't have been as much surprised as you may&#xD;
think. I liked him from the first; he is a manly, hand-&#xD;
some fellow; has so much the air of a gentleman that i[&#xD;
wondered where the devil he got it from! But don't&#xD;
come pow-wowing over me about his father. He is a&#xD;
rascal-an infernal rascal !"&#xD;
"Dear, dear papa," interposed Mrs. Meredith.&#xD;
"I tell you he is, and you ought to be ashamed to~&#xD;
have any mercy on such a fellow! What! desert his&#xD;
wife and child! impose on a very angel, as you call her,&#xD;
by a false marriage6 I carry her off from her friends! and&#xD;
then you to pity him! to contrive excuses for him! nay,&#xD;
even rejoice in a connection with him! I tell you, Ja-&#xD;
net, a woman's feeling ought to teach you better. Let&#xD;
Eleanor marry his son; he has not had the bringing of&#xD;
him up, and therefore he may deserve her; but don't&#xD;
expect me to be proud of such a marriage if his pedigree&#xD;
counted back to Japhet, and he could .cover the State&#xD;
of New York with gold pieces! No, nor to clap palms&#xD;
with him, and to insult truth and honor by a pretended&#xD;
cordiality with such a man! Let him 'keep out of my&#xD;
way-that's best for both of us."&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton was so taken 'aback that she could&#xD;
frame no reply; and while she hesitated, her father con-&#xD;
tinued:&#xD;
"I tell you, Janet, you women have much to answer&#xD;
for. There would be fewer broken hearts if you frown-&#xD;
ed such villains down. All laws, civil and religious,&#xD;
can not do as much for your sexas you can do for your-&#xD;
selves."&#xD;
His daughter, in despair of a more patient hearing, re-&#xD;
&#xD;

476          WALTER TEORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
tired to seek Eleanor. "Mr. Middleton was that day to&#xD;
be introduced to his future daughter-in-iaw, and to such&#xD;
of her family as he 2ha&amp;amp;not .yet seen. The absence of&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence at such a time could not fail to be re-&#xD;
marked. What was to be done ?"&#xD;
"I will speak to him," said Eleanor; and, with a fear-&#xD;
less step, she ventured where no one else would have&#xD;
gone just at that moment.&#xD;
On entering she threw her arm round his neck, and&#xD;
then, sinking on her knee before him, said, in a low, rev-&#xD;
erential Voice, "Your blessing, dear grandpapa !"&#xD;
Raising her up, and pressing her to him, she caught a&#xD;
few words, partly in' his mother tongue, always to him&#xD;
the most tender; and ldndsdogter! ket vaderlik daic! told&#xD;
how~affectionately he commended to Heaven his "grand-&#xD;
daughter~" the joy of "the paternal roof."&#xD;
"You will forgive me now, dear grandpapa~.won'~&#xD;
you-for Crossing your wishes? You see I couldn't&#xD;
help it," she added, with a deprecating smile.&#xD;
"No, no, my lamme~je (little lamb), you could not, to&#xD;
be sure. I have long forgiven all that, and love you.&#xD;
better than ever."&#xD;
"And won't you love Walter, too, a little, by de-&#xD;
grees?"&#xD;
'~ To be sure-to be sure; I do already, but don't ask&#xD;
me to like his father, Kelly."&#xD;
"I shall not, sir. With your character you can take&#xD;
but 'one view of his conduct. But you know, grand-&#xD;
papa, that from my relation to him it will be my duty&#xD;
to suppress feelings that would be painful to his ~on;&#xD;
and even to try, by obtaining' some hold on his affec-&#xD;
tions, to influence him favorably. You know, dear&#xD;
grandpapa, the mercy we hope for we must practice."&#xD;
"Yes, yes; I can not deny that; and if any body can&#xD;
make' him a better man, 'tis you, Leentje; and Gertrude,&#xD;

I suppose she, of course, will think, the greater the sin-&#xD;
ner, the louder th~ call to give him a lift. But don't, II&#xD;
command you, disgrace yourselves and' dishonor virtue&#xD;
by pitying and cosseting such a fellow I Tell him plain,&#xD;
wholesome truths. If he's worth saving, that'll do him&#xD;
most good. Such a patient as that must not be fed upon&#xD;
sugar-plums, nor handled with gloves. He requires&#xD;
thorough treatment. If there's an~# reaction in the sys-&#xD;
tem, it will bear it; and if not, let him die and be-"&#xD;
Eleanor cut short the forthcoming malediction by say-&#xD;
ing, "You remember Captain Talbot, sir?"&#xD;
"To be sure I do-the puppy! But they tell me he's&#xD;
dead, so I shall not waste breath on him."&#xD;
"He Was a great deal more wicked than you supposed,&#xD;
sir. I have a sketch of him here-a curious specimen&#xD;
of human nature! May Ii read it to you? He and Mr.&#xD;
Middleton were relatives."&#xD;
"I dare say; a brace of rascals I A pleasant family&#xD;
to marry you into I" growled the old gentleman, in great&#xD;
disgust. "But. read on; let's have itt"&#xD;
Eleanor obeyed. A change of feeling was soon ap-&#xD;
parent in Mr. Lawrence's countenance. Contempt was&#xD;
overpowered by indignation, but mingled, nevertheless,&#xD;
with interest; while his contracting brow, his heightened&#xD;
color, his cane-the unerring exponent of his emotions&#xD;
-expressed the effect of the narrative. Occasionally an&#xD;
interjection or an anathema broke from him. He would&#xD;
rise from his chair and instantly reseat himself as if&#xD;
bodily motion were necessary to relieve the intense wrath&#xD;
that boiled within. The vices of Talbot were just those&#xD;
most abhorrent to him. The conduct of Mr. Middleton&#xD;
lost its pre-eminence in evil. A new emotion succeed-&#xD;
ed. He was more weak than wicked-'----himself a victim&#xD;
as well as a destroyer. Some compassionate, throbs were&#xD;
felt. Then, as the tale, darkened by death and sorrow,&#xD;

drew to a conchxsion-~-when remorse and self-abasement&#xD;
alone were expressed, with no vain attempt at excuse or&#xD;
justification-he could stand it no longer.&#xD;
Throwing himself back in his chair, he exclaimed,&#xD;
"Oh, good Lord, what poor creatures we are I Lead us&#xD;
not into temptation1 for who can stand? There7 there,&#xD;
child! go away. I have need to thank Heaven, on my&#xD;
knees, that I have not been left to myself. Lie and&#xD;
cheat, I never could; they were not my besetting sins.&#xD;
But my anger has been fierce, and my wrath has been&#xD;
cruel, and injustice and suffering have clung to my&#xD;
skirts. With such passions, what might I not have been&#xD;
left to do? If a saving hand has been held out to me,&#xD;
should I not do the like to another? Show mercy, ye&#xD;
that hope to be forgiven! Go, go, child! leave me a&#xD;
while to myself."&#xD;
Eleanor kissed his hand and withdrew in silence.&#xD;
When Mr. Middleton called, Mi. Lawrence, unasked,&#xD;
requested an introduction to him.&#xD;

A PEEl? AT THE PAST.&#xD;

479.&#xD;
&#xD;
In&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTEJ3~ XLYIL&#xD;
THE visit to England was imperative-not more urged&#xD;
by Mrs. Cecil than desired by Walter himself. The im-&#xD;
age of his mother impressed on his infancy had never&#xD;
been effaced; and he earnestly wished to testify his rev-&#xD;
erence for her, and to make such arrangements for the&#xD;
future as should satisfy the various claims now to be&#xD;
considered. But to tear himself from Eleanor, at the&#xD;
very moment she had given herself to him, was more&#xD;
than he could bear.&#xD;
An immediate marriage was the only way to recon-&#xD;
cile these conflicting interests. Accordingly, on one of&#xD;
the finest of October mornings, at about eleven o'clock,&#xD;
carriages were observed to stop in Broadway, in front of&#xD;
Trinity Church. As all notice had been guarded against,&#xD;
there was little danger of intrusion; and if any curious&#xD;
loungers did follow those who alighted and passed with-&#xD;
i~, their presence was unobserved. If such there were,&#xD;
they would have seen, fronting the officiating clergyman,&#xD;
a youthful pair with tender and reverent mien; a gen-&#xD;
tleman in mourning garments, not so sad as his pale&#xD;
face; happy parents, though giving away their daugh-&#xD;
ter; friends scarce less loving than parents; and, as the&#xD;
head and crowning honor of the group, an old gentle-&#xD;
man in the elaborate costume of a by-gone time, but&#xD;
whose hak, handsome face gave no indication of infirm-&#xD;
ity; his hands crossed on his gold-headed cane, his fig-&#xD;
ure slightly inclining, his eyes occasionally cast upward,,&#xD;
as if in prayer and benediction. The service was soon&#xD;
oVer; the party left the church and re-entered their car-&#xD;

&#xD;
riages. Walter and Eleanor Cecil were one and indi-&#xD;
visible.&#xD;
Those were not the days of bridal tours-a fashion&#xD;
originating in a foreign country, in a class by which Cs.&#xD;
cape from conventionality was felt as a privilege-glad'&#xD;
to find in elegant retirement, or some rustic retreat, free-&#xD;
dom to be natural and happy. Such fashion had not&#xD;
then been, imported and caricatured here, where it was&#xD;
not wantecL Those who might be as private and undis-&#xD;
turbed .as they pleased at home, did not then rush to&#xD;
steam-boats, rail-roads, and public places; and delicate&#xD;
young women did not run away from the "sheltering&#xD;
grove of their own kindred," to make themselves .a mark&#xD;
for impertinence and ctiriosity. The hymeneal torch&#xD;
was n~t then extinguished as soon~as lighted, but people&#xD;
staid at home and kept it burning.&#xD;
There were, to be sure, customs and ceremonies some-&#xD;
times rather tiresome, and a routine that wealth and sta-&#xD;
tion4 were expected to observe. In some places, among&#xD;
those of Thitch descent, on the wedding-night, the doors&#xD;
of the house were besieged by a mob of children, who ex~&#xD;
pected that their good wishes for the vro4 i/c hru~d (ixierry&#xD;
bride)sho~.ild be responded to in a shower of cakes, which&#xD;
she, in a Dutch doggerel, was requested to "throw out."&#xD;
I~eversing -the present order, the wedding gifts, few and&#xD;
simple, were conferred by the bride-on her special attend-&#xD;
ants. There was~ no bridal table spread with costly offer-&#xD;
ings, requiring the presence of a police-officer to guard it;&#xD;
and, above al1~ there were no articles, kiredfor ~ke oecas~on.,&#xD;
inscribed as the gifts of "affectionate friends," but design-&#xD;
ed only 'to swell the glittering bubble of the moment,&#xD;
and.- th~n tQ be - rettirned to the shops and shoW-cases&#xD;
whence they had been taken pro gem.' Pot three morn-&#xD;
ings or more, the' happy bridegrooni, in exchange for&#xD;
the congratulations of his friends, gave wine and punch;&#xD;
&#xD;
and, for as many evenings, the bride, supported by her&#xD;
nymphs, received a succession of admiring guests. But&#xD;
in all this there was enough that was hearty and person-&#xD;
al to compensate for a little' effort.&#xD;
In -the case of our young friends, these usages* were,&#xD;
for obvious reasons, dispensed with, much, however, to&#xD;
the regret of the old gentleman.&#xD;
The counsel, "whenever you have nothing to say, say&#xD;
nothing," is never more yorthy of observance than in&#xD;
the winding :utp of a story, which, perhaps, to some, may&#xD;
have little worth the telling. The reader, if such there&#xD;
be, shall not much longer be detained.&#xD;
A week has elapsed- since the Church bestoweff its&#xD;
sanction. A gallant ship is spreading her sails; the wind&#xD;
is-fair, farewells are exchanged, and Mr. and Mrs. Cecil,&#xD;
from the deck of the "Lovely Nan," are making parting&#xD;
signals to those on shore, who linger to catch the Ia~t&#xD;
wave of his fiat, and the last flutter of her scarf. And&#xD;
now, if any one would know in what their friends found&#xD;
consolation, it will appear in the following letter from&#xD;
Mrs. Grafton:&#xD;
"Rosenberg, January 10, 18--.&#xD;
"DEAREST ELEANoR.,-Your letter, just received, an-.&#xD;
nouncing your safe arrival, excited feelings you can well&#xD;
understand. We had been cautioned not to expect ti-&#xD;
dings under three months; you may imagine, therefore,&#xD;
how welcome they. were, a week earlier- than the time&#xD;
prescribed.&#xD;
"Your touching account of your reception and of&#xD;
your admirable new mother delights us. But, amid ~dl&#xD;
the love lavished 'on you and the novelties that meet&#xD;
you, I see that you sigh for accounts of home which I&#xD;
hasten, therefore, to give. I have written once-.~-a ddl.&#xD;

48a          WALTER THORNLEY; OR,&#xD;
thrown into shadow by the withdrawal of our sun? 'In&#xD;
that I inforrned you of our return here.&#xD;
"I do not know what papa would have done after all&#xD;
our recent excitement, had it not been that another wed~&#xD;
ding was to be eared for. Accordingly, preparations&#xD;
were inaniediately made, and on the largest scale, for that&#xD;
of dear Phil and Priscilla. ' 'This time,' he said, 'he&#xD;
was resolved to have it in his own way; he would have&#xD;
no more "hugger-mugger" marriages; nothing done in ~&#xD;
corner, as if people were ashamed of it.' Not only all&#xD;
the neighboring gentry were invited, but every one who,&#xD;
as friends of the bride or her family, could expect or de-&#xD;
sire to be included. Dear papa ! he was, as usual, trans-&#xD;
parent; his humility a pretty sure gauge of his pride, un-&#xD;
plying, plainer than by words, 'Let no man dare to say&#xD;
I am not satisfied.7&#xD;
"Of course, you know, the service had to be perform-&#xD;
ed by our dominie, a prelude to Priscilla being 'cut off&#xD;
from her people.' But for this she was prepared; and,&#xD;
having been only 'born in the meeting,' as they say,&#xD;
there wa~ no sacrifice of principle. She begged, how-&#xD;
ever, to retain her dress, and in this Phil concurred.&#xD;
'He should not,' as he said, L know her as his own, if she&#xD;
were attired as one of the world's people; besides, it be.&#xD;
came her better than any other.' How they may settle&#xD;
it hereafter I can not say, but at present she retains&#xD;
'dress and address;' and, for my own part, I like both.&#xD;
They are so in keeping with her character Ii should re-&#xD;
gret to see them renounced. But papa was resolved&#xD;
that she should he as well arrayed as could be made to&#xD;
comport with her style; so your mother was directed by&#xD;
him to send the prettiest Quaker dress that could be de-&#xD;
vised;~ and, certainly, Priscilla did look lovely in it!&#xD;
"I was, however, more concerned for herself than her&#xD;
dress, fearing lest a circle more numerous and distin-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
guished than she was ever be fore in, should overpower&#xD;
her. I might have spared my anxiety. It was curious&#xD;
to see how extremes meet. How the renunciation of&#xD;
'man-worship,' and all the vanities of life, produced the&#xD;
effect at which artificial training aims-for no high-bred&#xD;
lady could have been more calm. her pale cheek, and&#xD;
an occasional tremor of her lip, betrayed the emotion&#xD;
natural to the occasion, but there was no disturbing&#xD;
sense of inferiority.&#xD;
"The prettiest thing, however, I have not told you.&#xD;
The day before the wedding we were sent for into papa's&#xD;
room, where it appeared that Priscilla had been desired&#xD;
to meet us. Addressing himself to her, he said, 'You&#xD;
may remember, my child, I once promised you a mar-&#xD;
riage portion, provided you conformed to the condition&#xD;
I proposed. Do you recollect it?'&#xD;
I do,' she replied.&#xD;
"' If I have substituted other conditions,' he contin-&#xD;
ued, with a sriaile, 'I am virtually bound by the same&#xD;
promise, if you accept them. Here is the fulfillment.'&#xD;
"It was a deed of the Mill Farm to her and her heirs&#xD;
forever! Now, was not this like papa? It was remov-&#xD;
ing her parents from a condition of more or less depend-&#xD;
ence on him, and placing their comfort and happiness in&#xD;
her hands. But this was not the end.&#xD;
"Her heart seemed too full for speech, but, when able&#xD;
to reply, she said, 'This may not be.',&#xD;
"'Why not, you foolish girl?' said he, impatiently;&#xD;
'why not?'&#xD;
"'For the reason that it is taking thy inheritance&#xD;
from thine own blood to give it to strangers. Nay, hear&#xD;
me. I may prove faithless or weak, and bestow it on&#xD;
my kindred, which is not thy intention. Put not tempt-&#xD;
ation in my way. And, furthermore, it hath a show&#xD;
of distrust of thy grandson's good-will to my parents,&#xD;

which I know of a certainty will never fail. Give it,&#xD;
theiFofore, to him, as is fitting,' and, with an appealing&#xD;
look, she turned to u~.&#xD;
"' I trembled for her, knowing how much it displeases&#xD;
papa to have his generosity thrown back on his hands.&#xD;
But her plain truth always finds an entrance into his&#xD;
heart; 'and, when Mr. 0-rafton said, 'I think, sir, Pris-&#xD;
cilla is right,' he only laid his hand caressingly on her&#xD;
head, and replied, 'Well, well, be it ~so.' So thus runs&#xD;
the dee&amp;amp;&#xD;
"Another thing, which, though small, will interest you.&#xD;
I had felt a little apprehensive lest the proper feeling&#xD;
should not be manifested on the part of the servants.&#xD;
But 'as in the Shandy family 'nothing ever seemed to&#xD;
work in the ordinary way,' so it proves wherever Pris-&#xD;
cilla is concerned. Instead of betraying any thing of&#xD;
the negro preference for the 'quality,' they were all true&#xD;
to Philip-Aunt Flore, of course, giving the key-note.&#xD;
"'Massa Phil,' slae said, '.a rcde g~n'elmaia! Didn't&#xD;
bring no strange lady to bo missus ober dem, but one&#xD;
m6se like 'one ob de family; growki up dere; reached&#xD;

How much her tendency to the rising sun had to do&#xD;
with this, I do not care to inquire; but, Idoubt not, much&#xD;
more her real affection. To this Pomp replied with a&#xD;
wave of his 'hamnd and 'an air of superior information.&#xD;

we shall communicate with the old mansion. On the&#xD;
farther side papa has given us ground enough to carry&#xD;
out all our small purposes of arbor and horticulture.&#xD;
The 'little gray hermitage,' as Mr. Grafton calls it, that&#xD;
sheltered him and W~dter so many years, and to which&#xD;
both are much attached, is to be loaned rent-free to the&#xD;
joint occupancy of their friends Damie and Jed, who&#xD;
are to set up housekeeping together, but on the platonic&#xD;
platform. At first, I understand that she objected to&#xD;
the copartnership, on the ground that 'folks would talk;'&#xD;
but Mr. Grafton quieted her scruples by reminding her&#xD;
that 'she and he had lived much on the same terms for&#xD;
a long while, and that he had never heard that the rep-&#xD;
utation of either had suffered.' All that is required of&#xD;
them is to keep the place in decent order, which, as.&#xD;
ideas differ on this point, I see will never be done with-&#xD;
out douceurs from the gentlemen, and occasional -visits&#xD;
from you and me.&#xD;
"Your parents are well and cheerful. Mr. Grafton&#xD;
has just returned from a visit to Mr. Middleton, whom&#xD;
he found more calm than he expected. Wilson said he&#xD;
was greatly altered-no more of those dreadful parox-&#xD;
ysms-kind and patient; but, though very quiet, always&#xD;
sad. He sees no one; goes nowhere but to your fa-&#xD;
ther's; and Wilson, with the superstition of his class, con-&#xD;
fidentially intimated that the change portended a great-&#xD;
er one. But the explanation is easy. The blow so long&#xD;
impending has fallen. There is 'nothing more to fear&#xD;
nor to conceal-the heavy burden of untruth is removed.&#xD;
But, though life is still merely endurance, the influence&#xD;
of Walter and yourself may impart an interest t6 it. If&#xD;
not, and if weary years of a strange sorrow are to call&#xD;
for sacrifice and forbearance on your.part, and that your&#xD;
otherwise full cup of happiness must have this infusion&#xD;
of bitter, it is but another form of the common lot. It&#xD;

NOTICE.&#xD;
Messrs. Hxarrar &amp;amp; Buorumis take this opportunity of cautioning the public&#xD;
against several spurious publications, which, by artful advertisements, are made&#xD;
to appear as though emanating from Dr. Livingstone. They are authorized to&#xD;
say that Dr. Livingatone repudiates them entirely, and wishes it to be generally&#xD;
known that the present work is the only authentic narrative of his Adventures&#xD;
and ,Travels in Africa.&#xD;
A book which, before it has been ten days in the hands of the public, will&#xD;
have been perused by perhaps 30,000 readers-a book second only to Lord Mac-&#xD;
aulay's History ~f England in the inordinate extent of its circulation. No won-&#xD;
der-it addresses itself to large and numerous classes-the great religious world,&#xD;
the commercial world, the seientific.-Literary Gazette.&#xD;
The book is one of the most captivating description; in style simple, clear, and&#xD;
graphic, and in matter such as no other living traveler's experience could afford.&#xD;
From the beginning to the end of the volume there is not a page that does not&#xD;
compel the attention, not a page that does not offer something novel, It is a&#xD;
wonder-book all, through-N. Y. courier and Enquirer.&#xD;

B~ THOMAS J. PAGE, U.S ~.,&#xD;
Commander of the Expedition.&#xD;
One Volume Large Octavo, with Map and numerous illustrations.&#xD;
Muslin, Three Dollars.&#xD;
This Volume contains the Offlcial Narrative of one of the most important ex-&#xD;
peditious ever sent out by our Government. Early in 1853 the steamer Water&#xD;
Witch was placed nuder the command of Lieutenant PAGE, with instructions to&#xD;
explore the Rivers of La Plata, and report upon their navigability and adapta..&#xD;
tion to commerce. Lieutenant PAGE executed his commission with rare fidelity&#xD;
and intelligence, and has embodied the results in this volume. The explora-&#xD;
tions described in the Narrative embrace an extent of 3600 miles of river naviga-&#xD;
tion, and 4400 miles of journey by land in Paraguay and the Argentine Confed-&#xD;
eration. The River Paraguay alone was found to be navigable, at low water, by&#xD;
a steamer drawing nine feet, for more than two thousand miles from the ocean.&#xD;
The basin of La Plata is almost equal. in extent to that of the Mississippi, and&#xD;
not inferior in salubrity of climate and fertility of soil, while the head waters of&#xD;
its rivers penetrate the richest mineral' provinces of Brazil and Bolivia. The&#xD;
products of this region must find their outlet through the River La Plata. The&#xD;
population numbers scarcely one person to a square snilebut great inducements&#xD;
to emigration are now offered by the Ar~ntine Confederation. The commerce&#xD;
of the cotsntry, already considerable, is capable of immediate and almost indef-&#xD;
inite increase.&#xD;
Lieutenant PAGE's Narrative contains ample information respecting the soil,&#xD;
climate, and productions of the country, and the manners, habits, and customs of&#xD;
the people. A full account is given of the unfortunate rupture with Paraguay,&#xD;
showing conclusively that the attack upon the Water Witch was altogether un-&#xD;
warranted, and the allegations by which President Lopez attempted to justify it&#xD;
entirely destitute of truth. An interesting and valuable account of the Jesuit&#xD;
Missions in La Plata in appended to the Narrative.&#xD;
The Illustrations comprise the accurate Map of the Country prepared by the&#xD;
-rder~ of our Government, Portraits of Urquiza, Lopez, Francia, and Loyola,&#xD;
numerous Engravings of Scenery, Character, and Incident.&#xD;

discriminate, and appears to be held in strong check by the controlling recollec-&#xD;

CURTIS'S* HISTORY&#xD;
OF THE&#xD;
C ON.S TI T UT JON.&#xD;
HISTORY OF THE ORIGIN, FORMATION, AND ADOP-&#xD;

STATES. By GEORGE TICKNOIt CURTIS. Complete in 2 vols.&#xD;
&amp;amp;vo, Muslin, $4 00; Law Sheep, $5 00; Half Calf, $6 00.&#xD;
A. book so thorough as this in the comprehension of its subject, so impartial&#xD;
In the summing up of its judgments, so well considered in its method, and so&#xD;
truthful in its matter, may safely challenge the most exhaustive criticism. The&#xD;
Constitutional History of our country has not before been made the subject of a&#xD;
special treatise. We may congratulate ourselves that an author has been found&#xD;
so capable to do full justice to it; for that the work will take its rank among the&#xD;
received text-books of our political literature will be questioned by no one who&#xD;
has given it a careful perusal.-Nationca intelligence.&#xD;
We know of no person who is better qualified (flow that the late Daniel Web-&#xD;
ster is no more), to undertakethis important history.-Boston Journal.&#xD;
It will take its place among the classics of American Iiterature~~2~Boston Cour-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
The ~inthor. has given years to the preliminary studies, and nothing has es-&#xD;
caped him iii the patient and Conscientious researches to which he has devoted&#xD;
so ample portion of time. Indeed, the work has been so thoroughly performed&#xD;
that it will never need to be done over again; for the sources have been exhaust-&#xD;
ed, and the materials put together with so much judgment and artistic skill that&#xD;
taste and the sense of completeness are entirely satisfied..-....N. 1.'. Daily Times.&#xD;
A most important and valuable contribution to the historical and political lit-&#xD;
erature of the tTnited States. All publicists and students of public law will he&#xD;
grateful to Mr. Curtis for the diligence and assiduity with which he has wrought&#xD;
out the great mine of diplomatic lore in which the Coundations of the American&#xD;
Constitution are laid, and for' the light he has thrown on his wide and arduous&#xD;
stlbject.-Loidon Morning Ohroniele.&#xD;
Totrace the history of the formation of the Constitution, and explain the cir-&#xD;
cumstances of the time and country out of which its 'various provisions grew, is a&#xD;
task worthy of the highest talent. To have performed that task in a satisfacto-&#xD;
ry rinani~er is an nbhicvement with which an honorable ambition may well be&#xD;
gratified. 'We can honestly say that in our opinion Mr. Curtis has fairly won&#xD;
this distinction......J~t. .Y. Courier and Enquire~'.&#xD;
We have seen no history which surpasses it in the essential qualities of a&#xD;
standard work destined to hold a permanent place in the impartial judgment of&#xD;
future generations......Bos~o~ Traveler.&#xD;
Should the second volume sustain the chargeter of the first, we hazard nothing&#xD;
in claiming for the entire publication the character of a standard work. It will&#xD;
furnish the only sure guide to the interpretation of the Constitution, by unfolding&#xD;
historically the wants it was intended to supply, and the evils which it was in-&#xD;
tended to remedy...-.Boston Daily Advertiser.&#xD;
This volume is an important. contribution to our constitutional and historical&#xD;
literature,. ~ '~ Every true fri end of the Constitution will gladly welcome it.&#xD;
The' author has presented a narrative clear and interesting. It evinces careful&#xD;
research, skillful handling of material, lucid statement, and a desire to write in&#xD;
a tone and manner worthy of the great theme.-Boston Post.&#xD;

COMPLETION OP ~ROTE'S HISTORY OP G1iEE4JE.&#xD;
A HISTORY OF GREECE'~&#xD;
PROM THE EARLiEST PERIOD TO THE CLOSE OF THE GENERA-&#xD;
TION CONTEMPORARY WITh ALEXANDER THE GREAT.&#xD;
BY GEORGE GROTE, ESQ.&#xD;
Vol. XII. contains Portrait, Maps, and index. Complete in 12 vols. 12me,&#xD;
Muslin, $9 00; Sheep, $12 00; half Calf, $15 00.&#xD;
it is not often that a work of such magnitude is undertaken; more seldom still&#xD;
is such a work so perseveringly carried on, and so soon and yet so worthily ac-&#xD;
cixaplished. Mr. Grote has illustrated and invested with an entirely new signifi-&#xD;
cance a portion of the past history of humanity, which he, perhaps. thinks the most&#xD;
splendid that has been, and which all allow to have hpen very splendid. He has made&#xD;
great Greeks live again before us, and has enabled us to realize Greek modes of think-&#xD;
ing. He has added a great historical work to the language, taking its place with&#xD;
other great histories, and yet not like any of them in the special combination of&#xD;
merits which it exhibits: scholarship and learning such as we have been ac-&#xD;
customed to demand only in Germans; an art of grouping and narration different&#xD;
from that of Hume, different from that of Gibbon, arid yet producing the effect of&#xD;
sustained charm and pleasure; a peculiarly keen interest in events of the political&#xD;
order, and a wide knowledge of the business of politics; and, finally, harmoniz;ng&#xD;
all, a spirit of sober philosophical generalization always tending to view facts&#xD;
collectively in their speculative bearing as well as to record them individually.&#xD;
it is at once an ample and detailed narrative of the history of Greece, and a luctd&#xD;
philosophy of Grecian history.- London Atheneum, March 8,1856.&#xD;
Mr. Grote will be emphatically the historian of the people of Grcece.-Dublin&#xD;
University Magazine.&#xD;
The acute intelligence, the discipline, faculty of intellect, and the excellent eru-&#xD;
dition every one would Iqok for from Mr. Grote; but they will here also find the&#xD;
element which harmonizes these, and without which,, on such a theme, an orderly&#xD;
and solid work could not have been written.-Exaflnner.&#xD;
A work second to that of Gibbon alone in English historical literature. Mr.&#xD;
Grote gives the philosophy as well as the facts 01 history, and it would he difficult&#xD;
to find an author combining in the same degree the accurate learning of the schol-&#xD;
ar with the experience of a practical statesman. The completion of this great&#xD;
work may well be hailed with some degree of national pride and satisfaction.-&#xD;
Literary Gazette, March 8, 1856.&#xD;
The better acquainted any one is with Grecian history, and with the manner in&#xD;
which that history has heretofore been written, the higher will be his estimation&#xD;
uf this work. Mr. Grote's familiarity both with the great highways apd the oh-&#xD;
scurest by-paths of Grecian literature and antiquity has seldom been equaled, and&#xD;
not often approached, in unlearned England; while those Germans who have' ri-&#xD;
valed it have seldom possessed the quality which eminently characterizes Mr.&#xD;
Grote, of keeping historical imagination severely under the restraints of evidence.&#xD;
The great charm of Mr. Grote's history has been throughout the cordial admirn'&#xD;
tion he feels for the people whose acts and fortunes he has to relate. * * We bid&#xD;
Mr. Grote farewell; heartily congratulating him on the conclusion of a work which&#xD;
is a monument of English learning, of English clear-sightedness, and of English&#xD;
Love of freedom and the characters it produces-Spectator.&#xD;
Endeavor to become acquainted with Mr~ Grote, who is engaged on a Greek&#xD;
History. I expect a great deal from this production-NIEBUSIit, the Historian,&#xD;
to Professor Lianan.&#xD;
The author has now incontestahly won for himself the title, not merely of a&#xD;
historian, but of the historian of Greece-Quarterly Review.&#xD;
Mr. Grote is, beyond all question, the historian of Greece, unrivaled, so far as&#xD;
we know, in the erudition and genius with which he has revived the picture of a&#xD;
distant past, and brought home every part and feature of its history to our intel-&#xD;
lects and our he~rts.-London Times.&#xD;
For becoming dignity of style, unforced adaptation of results to principles, care-&#xD;
ful verification of theory by fact, and impregnation of fact by theory-for extensive&#xD;
and ~vell-weighed learning, employed with intelligence and taste, we have seen no&#xD;
historical work of modern times which we would place above Mr. Grote's bisto-&#xD;
ry-Morniezy Chronicle.&#xD;

The Novels, of which a reprint is now presented to the public,&#xD;
form one of the most admirable series of popular fiction that has re-&#xD;
cently been issued from the London press. They are marked by&#xD;
their faithful delineation of character, their naturalness and purity&#xD;
of sentiment, the dramatic interest of their plots, their beauty and&#xD;
force of expression, and their elevated moral tone. No current&#xD;
Novels can be more highly recommended for the family library,&#xD;
while their brilliance and vivacity will make them welcome to every&#xD;
