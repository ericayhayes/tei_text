No amount of mechanical ingenuity vould, however, account by itself for the&#xD;
popularity of Mr. Wilkie Collins's works. He has several other important qualifica-&#xD;
tions.  He writes an admirable style; he is thoroughly in earnest in his desire to&#xD;
please ; his humor, though distinctly fashioned on a model Mr. Dickens invented and&#xD;
popularized, is better sustained and less fantastic and affected than any thing which&#xD;
Mr. Dickens has of late years produced.-London Review.&#xD;
We can not close this notice without si word of eulogy on Mr. Collins's style. It&#xD;
is sun pie anti so manly; every word tells its own story; every phrase is perfect in&#xD;
itsel f-Lond'ni Reader.&#xD;
Of all the living writers of English fiction no one better understands the art of&#xD;
story-telling than Wilkie Collins.  He has a faculty of coloring the myste y of a&#xD;
plot, exciting terror, pity, curiosity, and other passions, such as belong to fe if any&#xD;
of his confreres, however much they may excel him, in other respects.  H s style,&#xD;
too, is singularly appropriate-less forced and artificial than the average mode n nov-&#xD;
clists.-Bosten T znScipt.             .-&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
A PURITAN FAMILY.&#xD;
ONE pleasant evening last summer I sat by&#xD;
the open window of my chamber, a large and&#xD;
airy room in the comfortable farm-house in&#xD;
which I and my family, and my sister with hers,&#xD;
had been located as boarders during the summer&#xD;
months, by our respective husbands. I gazed&#xD;
with loving eyes upon the merry group that&#xD;
were assembled in the orchard beneath : my&#xD;
husband, with his huge bulk extended lazily&#xD;
upon the grass, playfully shielding my sister's&#xD;
little Caroline from the fierce attack of a bellig-&#xD;
erent band of wild Indians, composed of my own&#xD;
two little urchins, Jamie and Frank; and at a&#xD;
little distance from them, upon a rustic bench,&#xD;
was seated white-robed Agnes, her baby in her&#xD;
arms, with her handsome husband leaning upon&#xD;
the back of the bench, whispering tender non-&#xD;
sense into her well-pleased ear as, devoted and&#xD;
lover-like a couple now, as when, five years be-&#xD;
fore, they had first taken upon themselves the&#xD;
bonds of matrimony.&#xD;
The picture was a pleasant one to my loving&#xD;
eyes, though I did not care just then to join the'&#xD;
party.  I had been reading,. as long as the&#xD;
waning light had permitted, and now, still re-&#xD;
gardless of the cries both from father and chil-&#xD;
dren, which summoned me to partake in their&#xD;
noisy sport, I leaned back indolently in my chair,&#xD;
content, in my present pensive mood, to enjoy&#xD;
the society of my domestic treasures at a peace-&#xD;
able distance. So I sat rocking to and fro in&#xD;
the -languid summer twilight, almost uncon-&#xD;
sciously enjoying the beauties of the scene be-&#xD;
fore me; watching the light flying clouds, as&#xD;
the stars singly and in clusters came timidly&#xD;
peering forth; watching the martins, as they&#xD;
darted with sharp, piercing chirp in and out of&#xD;
sight beneath the overhanging roof that sheltered&#xD;
my head; watching the lazy cows, homeward&#xD;
plodding up the dusty winding road ; the busy&#xD;
bees, swarming at the entrance of their hives,&#xD;
&#xD;
eager apparently to be done with the tumult of&#xD;
the day : I sat by the window listening to the&#xD;
joyous voices of my dear ones, hearing all the&#xD;
charming, dreamy sounds that the evening air&#xD;
bore to my listless ears, yet scarce knowing that&#xD;
I did so, for my thoughts were busy with the&#xD;
book which I had just finished reading, and&#xD;
which lay in my lap now, still ope at the last&#xD;
page. It was the autobiography of a woman;&#xD;
one who had lived, and loved, and suffered.&#xD;
Alas! how often does the first verb, when won-&#xD;
an is the subject, involve all that the other two&#xD;
express!  The story was a simple one, the&#xD;
whole interest of the tale centering in the sur-&#xD;
mounting of the trials which were brought upon&#xD;
the woman by the selfishness of the man she&#xD;
loved. But the story had been one of thrilling&#xD;
interest to me; I had pored over it every mo-&#xD;
ment of the long summer day that I could spare&#xD;
from my light domestic duties; and now, as&#xD;
night had drawn on, I had brought my book to&#xD;
the window, and had sat there straining my eyes&#xD;
in the uncertain light, too eager to get through&#xD;
to brook even the temporary delay that pro-&#xD;
curing a lamp would occasion. And now, the&#xD;
story concluded, and my mind relieved from the&#xD;
tension in which it had been held during the last&#xD;
few hours, I sat, swinging lazily back and forth&#xD;
in my rocking-chair, musing upon the book, and&#xD;
wondering why it was that tlhe joys and sorrows&#xD;
it portrayed should be so deeply interesting to&#xD;
one who neither knew nor cared for the indi-&#xD;
viduals concerned in the narration, And then&#xD;
my mind wandered back over the years of my&#xD;
own life ; a life that had been shadowed by mis-&#xD;
fortune and lightened by success ; a life into&#xD;
whi'h a great mise'"y ha-i once crept, an I yet&#xD;
which was now thankfully at rest ; drifting&#xD;
peacefully and contentedly toward the great&#xD;
ocean of Eternity toward which all mortality is&#xD;
tending.&#xD;
Why should not the story oP my joys and sor-&#xD;
rows prove as interesting to others as those of&#xD;
this woman have proved to me ? was the thought&#xD;
&#xD;

that then and there occurred to me ; and then, have been his own near blood relation, for a&#xD;
almost trembling at the audacity of the idea, stauncher little Puritan than she, I ween, came&#xD;
I said, "I will commit to paper the story of my not over in the Mayflower.  A truly good and&#xD;
life as I remember it ; its trials and temptations, pious woman she was ; and yet if I, her loving&#xD;
its struggles and contentions, its defeats and vie- daughter, may dare to criticise her revered char-&#xD;
tories ; and see if there be not in them an element acter, I must confess that she was almost too&#xD;
as interesting to other human hearts as the story strict a sectarian, and a little, just a little, un-&#xD;
of the woman of whom I have just been reading charitable ; one who was too apt in indignation&#xD;
contains for tme."  And thus my resolution once for the crime to forget to pity the criminal; one&#xD;
koried, without stopping to consider the expe- who, strong in her own integrity, could not sym-&#xD;

accomplished, and the result, be it good or bad, a more loving mother, never blessed a home with&#xD;

My father's namo was Manvers-James B.       My father was a merchant in Boston, doing a&#xD;
Manvers. iHe was a Bostonian born and bred, fine business in partnership with a brother of&#xD;

perhaps with only too good a cause, for lie failed had always borne an unblemished reputation ; a&#xD;

Manvers then was my father's name.  lie was this pattern Pharisee of the straightest sect of&#xD;
the descendant of an English family of great Pharisees, proved false to all the teachings of&#xD;
antiquity, and he had a genealogical table or his life, and succumbed at last to that insidious&#xD;

My mother was a Winthrop, and she too was   Oh ! such a terrible time there was when the&#xD;

rtian governor ; and certainly she deserved to particulars of that dreadfml time as if they had&#xD;
&#xD;
occurred but yesterday.   My father, aroused&#xD;
from his easy, indolent life to the terrible reali-&#xD;
ties of poverty and disgrace, remained for a&#xD;
time in a state of bewildered inaction, scarce&#xD;
knowing what to do, or to whom to turn ; per-&#xD;
-haps his very brain would have suffered from&#xD;
the shock had it not been for the grievous do-&#xD;
mestic afflictions which also fell upon us about&#xD;
- this time, serving to divert his mind from his&#xD;
business troubles in a manner effectual though&#xD;
severe.&#xD;
My sister Sophy,,then twelve years of age,&#xD;
was taken ill with scarlet fever ; within a few&#xD;
(ays little Maggie, the one next younger than&#xD;
myself, also sickened with the same fearful dis-&#xD;
order. The sickness terminated fatally in both&#xD;
cases ; the little one went first, she only suffer-&#xD;
ed three days, but Sophy lingered as many&#xD;
weeks, and then she, too, was borne to the&#xD;
church-yard. Mother never held her head up&#xD;
after her return from Sophy's funeral. Between&#xD;
sorrow, caused by the loss of her children, and&#xD;
the mortification springing from Uncle Charles's&#xD;
conduct, her heart was broken ; she sank into&#xD;
a rapid decline, and three months after the&#xD;
children's death, she too was taken away from&#xD;
us, and father and we three desolate girls were&#xD;
left helpless and despairing, tempted to believe&#xD;
that we certainly had been guilty of some great&#xD;
evil, and God's judgments were visiting us with&#xD;
inexorable atonements.&#xD;
I believe father would have followed mother&#xD;
to heaven very shortly, had it not been for a&#xD;
means apparently the most unlikely to have&#xD;
been attended with a beneficial effect upon his&#xD;
health. Some weeks after mother's death, while&#xD;
suffering most deeply from the effects of his af-&#xD;
fliction, his attention was-casually arrested by&#xD;
the sight of his own name in a newspaper para-&#xD;
graph.  He read the article in, which it occur-&#xD;
red almost involuntarily.  It was a reprehensi-&#xD;
bly sharp stricture upon his failure in business,&#xD;
and his present inaction written, it is to be&#xD;
hoped, by some one entirely ignorant of the&#xD;
great domestic afflictions which had fallen upon&#xD;
him. It gave a brief expose of Charles Win-&#xD;
throp's conduct, detailed the dishonorable posi-&#xD;
tion in which the once prosperous firm now&#xD;
tood, gave a list of those creditors who would&#xD;
certainly be heavy losers by the failure of the&#xD;
house to pay its honest debts, and finally wound&#xD;
up with a harsh rebuke of my father for his in-&#xD;
activity and seeming indifference to the busi-&#xD;
ness troubles which encompassed him.&#xD;
S "He is the cause," thus read the article&#xD;
"even though the innocent cause, of undeserved&#xD;
misery to hundreds, perhaps -to thousands, tom&#xD;
&#xD;
in a failure so extensive as this has been, the&#xD;
consequences of one man's crime shoot through&#xD;
innumerable ramifications into the hearts alike&#xD;
of rich and poor ; yet Mr. Manvers, now the&#xD;
only responsible member of the firm, takes no&#xD;
measures whatever to secure to his creditors&#xD;
even the poor percentage of his debts which he&#xD;
is able to give them ; he is living in luxury,&#xD;
surrounded by afiluence and comfort, while&#xD;
those whom lie, or others in his name, have so&#xD;
bitterly wronged are suffering the pangs of pov-&#xD;
erty which, if he were the man of honor he has&#xD;
always been considered to be, lie vould at least&#xD;
share, if he could not alleviate."&#xD;
"The man is right, whoever he be !" cried&#xD;
my father, springing to his feet and crushing&#xD;
the cruel paper in his hands. " Sharp though&#xD;
the words may be, they are not uncalled for nor&#xD;
undeserved. I had thought myself done with&#xD;
life, but a Munvers can not die with a dishonor-&#xD;
ed name."&#xD;
From that day my father roused himself to&#xD;
take an active part in the business which his&#xD;
faithful clerks had been endeavoring to hold&#xD;
together during the time of his tribulation.&#xD;
Though indolent he was energetic, and now&#xD;
with such an incentive to exertion before him&#xD;
as the preservation of the unisullied honor of&#xD;
his name, he applied himself to the settlement&#xD;
of his affairs with a resolution and concentra-&#xD;
tiveness which almost worked miracles.  The&#xD;
faiTure was a very heavy one, that fact could not&#xD;
be got over ; but he gave up all to meet his lia-&#xD;
bilities ; may mother's little fortune, which by&#xD;
will she had bequeathed exclusively to him; our&#xD;
fine house and its costly adornments ; plate,&#xD;
jewelry, books, all went, and by his good man-&#xD;
agement and prompt action, a far better per-&#xD;
centage of the liabilities was met than outsiders&#xD;
had believed possible.  His actual debt was&#xD;
thus brought down to a sum less terrible than&#xD;
he had ventured to anticipate. Then his old&#xD;
establishment fairly off his hands, his clerks&#xD;
discharged, himself homeless and destitute of&#xD;
all resources, with barely sufficient funds re-&#xD;
- served to keep himself and his children for a&#xD;
few months from actual want, he next turned&#xD;
his attention to obtaining the employment nec-&#xD;
essary for his future support.&#xD;
The business talents and sterling integrity&#xD;
of James B. Manvers, I say it proudly, were too&#xD;
- well known among the leading merchants of the&#xD;
city for him long to lack occupation.  Some of&#xD;
his old friends offered to advance him capital&#xD;
sufficient to start him in business again, but&#xD;
With proud humility lie refused to avail himself&#xD;
r of their kindness.&#xD;

MY HUSBAND'S CRIME.&#xD;

12                    MY HUSBAND'S CRIME.&#xD;
&#xD;
"My constitution has been much enfeebled&#xD;
by the troubles of the past year," he said,&#xD;
"and my life is too precarious to allow me to&#xD;
venture into the vortex of profit and loss on&#xD;
borrowed capital. Were I certain of ten years&#xD;
of life, I would thankfully, gladly avail myself&#xD;
of the kind offers of my friends ; as it is, fear-&#xD;
ing as 1 sometimes do, that scarce as many&#xD;
months are left to me, money now taken by me&#xD;
to be involved in the slow and uncertain chan-&#xD;
nels of trade, would almost surely be lost were I&#xD;
to die before being able to realize by it." Find-&#xD;
ing him immovable in this resolution, his&#xD;
friends then procured for him a situation as&#xD;
book-keeper in one of the leading houses in&#xD;
Boston. They gave hint a splendid salary for&#xD;
his services, and had lie chosen so to do, we&#xD;
could have lived almost as luxuriously as before ;&#xD;
4         but far different were my father's intentions.&#xD;
Renting a small house in an obscure street, fur-&#xD;
nishing it as humbly as decency would permit,&#xD;
and with the necessity of the strictest economy&#xD;
° ever before his mind and in his language to his&#xD;
family, there did my hither retire with its chil-&#xD;
dren, and there commenced a life of toil and&#xD;
self-sacrifice which any of the ancestors lie was&#xD;
so fond of talking about might have been proud&#xD;
to acknowledge.  Every year the small sut&#xD;
actually necessary for our support was drawn&#xD;
from his salary, and the balance was given to&#xD;
defray the debts which Charles Winthrop's vil-&#xD;
lainv had brought upon him; and as time sped&#xD;
hy, and every New Year found the balance&#xD;
against hiit growing rapidly smaller, my father&#xD;
toiled proudly on, his legitimate business occu-&#xD;
pying his days, while extra work in the shape&#xD;
of book.keepiiig, copying, etc., which he seldom&#xD;
found any difficulty in procuring, filled his&#xD;
evenings sometimes until far in the night with&#xD;
wearisome labor. Yet steadily lie persevered,&#xD;
scorning deprivations, glorying in sacrifice, and&#xD;
yearning, oh ! how eagerly, for the day to&#xD;
come when lie could once more call himself an&#xD;
honorable muan -- a Manvers, worthy of the&#xD;
name.&#xD;
There were three children of us, all girls ;&#xD;
father never had a son, aid it had been no&#xD;
slight trial to him to think that our family name&#xD;
must become extinct with him, for he himself&#xD;
had been an only son, and had not a relation in&#xD;
the world that he know of bearing his own name.&#xD;
However, he was proud and fond enough of us&#xD;
girls, and if lie had had a son 1 do not think ie&#xD;
could have loved hint more than he did us.&#xD;
L    Susan wvas the eldest ; shte wvas about fifteen&#xD;
&#xD;
her name and looked very much like her; an&#xD;
active, bustling little creature, a great worker,&#xD;
and scrupulously conscientious ; as ready as&#xD;
father himself to starve and pinch in every pos-&#xD;
sible way, that we might the soo er be rid of&#xD;
those terrible debts. We kept nd servant, and&#xD;
Sue, with such help as my nine y ar old hands&#xD;
could give her, did all the work of our tiny es-&#xD;
tablishment. She worked a great deal harder&#xD;
than father had any idea of, harder in fact than&#xD;
was at all necessary, but she was so nice and&#xD;
dainty, and had inherited all mother's cleanly,&#xD;
tidy ways, so that between her dread of spend-&#xD;
ing a cent more than we could actually avoid,&#xD;
and her determination to have every thing about&#xD;
the house as mother herself would have liked&#xD;
it, the poor little thing worked herself to death ;&#xD;
literally worked herself to death, for though she&#xD;
did not die for a good many years, yet the too&#xD;
great burdens borne by her at this tender period&#xD;
of her life, sapped her constitution and cut her&#xD;
off at three-and-twenty a prematurely old wom-&#xD;
an.  Of course father did not see this; he was&#xD;
out of the house all day, and whenever he was&#xD;
home lie found every thing neat and comforta-&#xD;
ble as hands could make it, while Sue, active la-'&#xD;
bor all finished in his absence, would be sitting&#xD;
at her sewing, as tidy and composed a little&#xD;
housekeeper as ever man was blessed with. Out'&#xD;
house was so tiny and compact, our family so&#xD;
small, and he, poor man, so entirely and utterly&#xD;
ignorant of the nature and amount of the work&#xD;
which the care of a house produces, that I sup-&#xD;
pose he thought, if he thought about the matter&#xD;
at all, that there was no more to do than would&#xD;
serve to keep Sue and myself healthily employ-&#xD;
ed. To be sure he hated bitterly that our time&#xD;
should be occupied so much with the drudgery&#xD;
of the domestic work, but then lie very seldom&#xD;
saw its so occupied, and if he did, to his regret-&#xD;
ful complaints Sue had always his own answer&#xD;
ready, "Wait until we are out of debt." Poor&#xD;
thing! she did not live to see the day, but fa-&#xD;
ther never knew what killed her.&#xD;
lie was very proud of Sue ; she was so active&#xD;
and energetic, reminding him, as he often said,&#xD;
so much of mother, that lie grew to rely upon&#xD;
her, to refer to and consult with her as he would&#xD;
have done with his wife, and when she was taken&#xD;
from us, it was to the full as great a blow as&#xD;
mother's death had been.&#xD;
I was the second daughter. Caroline is my&#xD;
name, and I believe I was more like father in&#xD;
temperament and appearance than were either&#xD;
of hIis other children, at least he always said so&#xD;
&#xD;
when we moved to our little home in Willow  himself. Sue and the little one were small and&#xD;
Street ; she was mother's own child, she bore fair, with light hair and blue eyes ; they were&#xD;
&#xD;
each active and industrious, great talkers, and&#xD;
possessed of gentle, even tempers. I grew to be&#xD;
much taller than they did, I am now, as a&#xD;
woman, considerably above the middle height,&#xD;
while they were below it; Sue particularly, like&#xD;
mother, was very small. 1 am  dark too, with&#xD;
black hair, and eyes which every body told me&#xD;
were just like father's, and I was honestly glad&#xD;
of that, for a handsomer pair of grey eyes than&#xD;
lie possessed I never saw. In disposition, too,&#xD;
I resemble father. I am naturally quiet and&#xD;
reserved ; indolently averse to exertion, with a&#xD;
quick temper, and a jealous, suspicious nature&#xD;
that I come by naturally, I suppose, for that was&#xD;
not one of father's characteristics by any means.&#xD;
The fourth sad last member of our tiny home&#xD;
circle was baby Agnes, but two years old when&#xD;
mother died, and the dearest, loveliest creature&#xD;
God ever sent to earth; we all united in trying&#xD;
to spoil her, and we should certainly have suc-&#xD;
ceeded, had it been possible to pervert her lovely&#xD;
disposition ; she was a very beautiful child, and&#xD;
grew up to be as fair a flower as ever blossomed&#xD;
&#xD;
benefit of father's. advice and assistance, and&#xD;
as the teacher was patient and loving, and the&#xD;
scholar diligent and ambitious, my progress was&#xD;
rapid enough to satisfy even my proud father.&#xD;
It is true I had none of the aecomplislhments&#xD;
now deemed almost essential to the education&#xD;
of a lady; my father could not bestow them upon&#xD;
me himself, and the expense of hiring teachers&#xD;
could not even be thought of, but a solid,&#xD;
thorough English education I did receive, and&#xD;
it was a blessing fully appreciated by me, though&#xD;
I longed for still higher advantages with a long-&#xD;
ing that I would not have had my father know&#xD;
for worlds.&#xD;
Thus eight years sped away ; then came the&#xD;
first break in our happy home. Poor Site began&#xD;
to droop ; she had one little cold after another,&#xD;
and it seemed as though before she could fairly&#xD;
recover from one she would be attacked by a&#xD;
severer one ; then she began to cough contin-&#xD;
ually, and so it went on front bad to worse, un-&#xD;
til her worn-out frame gave way, and she sank&#xD;
into her early grave, the most unselfish, uncom-&#xD;
&#xD;
in a home garden.  As I said, she was fair and plaining little martyr that ever sacrificed herself&#xD;
small, like Sue, with blue eyes and light hair ; for the welfare of others.&#xD;
but while Sue's thin tresses were combed back  ier death was a great blow to father, as in-&#xD;
in plain flaxen braids, Agnes's luxuriant hair deed it was to all of us ; every thing seemed ti&#xD;
drooped around her sunny face in a shower of go wrong with us after that. I did my best to&#xD;

friends, his employers, besought him to rest ; to&#xD;
recruit his health, which all saw was fast failing&#xD;
him, in vain ; he would give but one answer to&#xD;
all such entreaties-"-'' Next year I will rest." At&#xD;
last the end cane.  On the evening of the New&#xD;
Year lie came home, later than usual, and seem-&#xD;
ing more utterly exhausted than he had ever yet&#xD;
confessed himself to be, Before he took off&#xD;
either hat or coat, he gave to me the bundle of&#xD;
papers lie was grasping in his hands. " I an a&#xD;
free man at last, Caroline,'' he said ; "nowI can&#xD;
die in peace." I scarcely needed a glance at&#xD;
the papers to know what were their contents;&#xD;
they were the receipts given to hiimii that lay by&#xD;
the last of his creditors ; lie no longer owed any&#xD;
nan a farthing. 'Ilie struggle was over now ;&#xD;
the powerful incentive that had so long sustained&#xD;
his failing strength was gone; and he sue-&#xD;
c (umbed at once. lie never left the house after&#xD;
New Year's Day, and before the spring violets&#xD;

Susan's grave, we had made a place beside her&#xD;
for fasthier, and Agnes and I were alone in the&#xD;
world.&#xD;
CIAPTEl II.&#xD;
LOOKING FORS WORK.&#xD;
I no not suppose any one-no man, certainly,&#xD;
and no woman who has .iot known from per-&#xD;
sonal experience our desolate.situation-can ful-&#xD;
ly understand the appalling sense of helplessness&#xD;
that settled upon me after my father's death,&#xD;
ind I was left to myself to look around ime and&#xD;
settle iipoin some mode of procedure for the fu-&#xD;
ture. Upon mie, I say, for Agnes in 11o degree&#xD;
shared with ne my anxiety. She was but twelve&#xD;
years old, and was remarkably childish even for&#xD;
her age.  She had been accustomed from her&#xD;
infancy to depend upon others for the most&#xD;
trifling of her daily needs, and this fact, added&#xD;
to her unusually sanguine temperament, gave&#xD;
her that perfect freedom from care for thie mor-&#xD;
row which is seldom  seen save in those who&#xD;
have always been taken care of by others. I do&#xD;
not siil)pose the child ever once asked herself&#xD;
tthe question of how we were to live in the fu-&#xD;
ture ; so lng as lier food, shelter and clothing&#xD;
were provided for her, she rested content.  A&#xD;
few floods of chillish tears after the funeral was&#xD;
Over, amid the, in less than a week's time she&#xD;
was her old, merry self again, seeming to have&#xD;
1o more care or trouble upon her mind than had&#xD;
the hird that warled in his cage in otir lomnely&#xD;
&#xD;
use in chaining her bright young spirit down to&#xD;
the dull companionship which was all my aching&#xD;
heart would let me give her, and so she studied&#xD;
and romped with her light-hearted school-mates,&#xD;
as thoughtless and unconcerned as though she&#xD;
had been the heiress of thousands, with no pos-&#xD;
sible shade of care clouding her future pros-&#xD;
pects.&#xD;
So I was alone, utterly alone; and oh' how&#xD;
helpless did I feel!  Bitterly did I'bewail my&#xD;
sex ; had I only been a man,  I thought, all&#xD;
would have been very different; I could easily&#xD;
have obtained employment of one kind or an-&#xD;
other, had it only been actual manual labor, by&#xD;
which I could have earned sufficient to support&#xD;
myself and my little sister; but now, even if there&#xD;
were work to be had, how could I, a friendless&#xD;
girl of nineteen, seek it out myself? Of course&#xD;
I ran over in my mind the few pitiful occupa-&#xD;
tions which a woman, claiming to be considered&#xD;
a lady, is allowed to engage in ; sewing or teach-&#xD;
ing being the only ones that I could settle upon&#xD;
as practicable, and even such occupation Ihad&#xD;
no more idea how to obtain than had Agnes&#xD;
herself. I had no near relations, and very few&#xD;
acquaintances; the summer friends who had&#xD;
crowded around us in the days of our prosperity,&#xD;
had long since fluttered away, and my father in&#xD;
his proud seclusion had sought no new ones.&#xD;
Neighbors we had, kind, sympathizing people,&#xD;
who came to us before and after the funeral,&#xD;
wondering, I suppose, many of them, how we girls&#xD;
were going to get along, but none of them were&#xD;
sufficiently intimate with us to ask the question,&#xD;
and most assuredly I would not broach the sub-&#xD;
ject myself. So a month glided by after the&#xD;
funeral, and I sat alone, day after day, feeling as&#xD;
if apprehension and distress would drive me&#xD;
wild, for I saw how rapidly our little stock of&#xD;
money was dwindling away, and I was ignorant&#xD;
as ever of any possible means of replenishing my&#xD;
purse. The doctor's and the undertaker's bills&#xD;
had been settled ; we had not now a debt in the&#xD;
world, but a new quarter's rent was running on,&#xD;
which I saw no earthly means of settling when&#xD;
due. Was not my situation pitiable?   Bad&#xD;
enough it would have been for any woman, had&#xD;
she been ever so capable or energetic, but when&#xD;
to my friendless, penniless situation was added&#xD;
the fact of my shy, indolent temperament, the&#xD;
case was doubly hard.&#xD;
At last, nerved to a desperate courage by the&#xD;
knowledge that something must be done, I de-&#xD;
termnhed to write to Mr. Ilenderson, the gen-&#xD;
tlemnan in whose employ say father hind spent&#xD;
&#xD;
LOOKING FOR WORK.              15&#xD;
&#xD;
the last ten years of his life. He was a wealthy&#xD;
old bachelor, fifty or sixty years of age, a good-&#xD;
hearted gentlemanly person, Who had proved&#xD;
himself a faithful friend to my father, and who&#xD;
would, I doubted not, be ready to assist and&#xD;
counsel me ; yet how I hated to ask him for&#xD;
help ! I suppose it was the Manvers blood&#xD;
boiling in my veins, for I do truly think that&#xD;
had it riot been for Agnes, I would have starved&#xD;
before asking of any one, even the small as-&#xD;
sistance I requested of him.&#xD;
I wrote to him briefly, stating that I found it&#xD;
necessary to obtain some employment by which&#xD;
I could maintain myself and sister, and I re-&#xD;
quested him, if he knew of any occupation suits-&#xD;
ble for me, that he would for my father's sake&#xD;
assist me in procuring it ; or, if he could not do&#xD;
this, that he would at least point out to me the&#xD;
Proper course to take in procuring such erploy-&#xD;
iaent for myself.&#xD;
Anxiously I waited the answer; I did not&#xD;
much apprehend a rebuff, for I felt every confi-&#xD;
dcnce in Mr. Henderson's good-will toward us.&#xD;
Though suspicious by nature, I had not yet&#xD;
learned distrust from experience of the world,&#xD;
and I was still too young, too child-like to&#xD;
dream of the cold-heartedness which after-years&#xD;
revealed to me in selfish humanity. Mr. lien-&#xD;
derson had called upon us twice after the fu-&#xD;
neral; it was he who, at my request, had set-&#xD;
tied the bills which were due against me, and I&#xD;
had paid him without hesitation from the ready&#xD;
money remaining in my hands. The last time&#xD;
he had called lie had seemed desirous of ascer-&#xD;
taining something of my intentions for the fu-&#xD;
ture, but, between my natural reserve and the&#xD;
violent grief which at that time rendered me in-&#xD;
different to all worldly affairs,. he could not,&#xD;
without point-blank inquiry, have ascertained&#xD;
any thing about our circumstances. He did&#xD;
not feel authorized, I suppose, to venture ques-&#xD;
tions that might have been deemed impertinent,&#xD;
so he departed as he had come, entirely unac-&#xD;
quainted with the state of our finances, or our&#xD;
intentions with respect to the future.&#xD;
Ike answered my letter in person. He call-&#xD;
ed one morning a day or two after I had written,&#xD;
ishen Agnes was at school, and I was alone in&#xD;
the house.   I answered the door myself; of&#xD;
course; he shook hands with me warmly, apol-&#xD;
ogizing as he did so for not having responded&#xD;
to niy appeal sooner.&#xD;
"The fact is," he said, "I had intended com-&#xD;
nug that same evening to see you about it, but I&#xD;
was called away from town unexpectedly that&#xD;
afternoon, and I only returned late last evening.&#xD;
I was too anxious to see you personally in the&#xD;
&#xD;
matter to satisfy myself by merely writing, and&#xD;
I hope that my delay has occasioned you no in-&#xD;
convenience."&#xD;
Of course I told him that it had not, hypo-&#xD;
crite that I was, when I had been fretting my-&#xD;
self sick over the delay for the last twenty-four&#xD;
hours. I invited him into the little parlor and&#xD;
saw him comfortably seated in father's chair&#xD;
before I ventured to recur to the subject of my&#xD;
letter.&#xD;
"I am afraid you will think me very trouble-&#xD;
some, Mr. IIenderson," I said. " I have no&#xD;
right to impose upon you the task of providing&#xD;
employment for a very useless girl, but as em-&#xD;
ployment must'be had, and 1 am very destitute&#xD;
of friends, 1 have ventured upon the liberty of&#xD;
applying to you."&#xD;
"No apologies, Miss Manvers,"lie responded&#xD;
good-humoredly, "no apologies, I beg of you.&#xD;
If any are needed they should come from me,&#xD;
for it was my place to have saved you the ne-&#xD;
cessity of making this application by profferiiig&#xD;
to you long ago such assistance as I might be&#xD;
able to render. I was to blame from the start,&#xD;
and I do niot know how I ever happened to neg-&#xD;
lect so plain a duty ; the only excuse I can&#xD;
offer now is that I had not the slightbt idea,&#xD;
until I received your letter, that you were in&#xD;
any need of such assistance as you there re-&#xD;
quest."  He'hesitated a moment, glanced in-&#xD;
quiringly at me, and then finding that 1 did not&#xD;
speak, continued :'' I suppose, since you have&#xD;
done me the honor of calling upon me as a&#xD;
friend, that I may without offense speak frankly&#xD;
to you?"&#xD;
I bowed my head in assent, but made no far-&#xD;
ther reply.&#xD;
"'Then explain to me, I beg of you, how it is&#xD;
that your father's daughters are driven to the&#xD;
necessity of supporting themselves by their own&#xD;
exertions. Your father has been in th receipt&#xD;
of a comfortable income for years hack, and I&#xD;
know that he has not lived up to it, at least by&#xD;
any visible expenditure. I have never been&#xD;
surprised at his habits of economy, for I knew&#xD;
that he always considered his hold upon life as&#xD;
ver' precarious; I supposed of course that lie&#xD;
was trying to save sufficient from his income&#xD;
to provide for his girls an independence against&#xD;
the time he should be taken from them; and&#xD;
yet you say he has not succeeded in doing this ?"&#xD;
" The little furniture this house contains, our&#xD;
small personal property, and two hundred doel-&#xD;
lars in cash, was the entire worldly amount of&#xD;
which my father died possessed," I answered,&#xD;
as anxious as himself that no farther misunder-&#xD;
standings should exist, and feeling so gloriously&#xD;

16                  MY HUSBAND'S CRIME.&#xD;
&#xD;
proud of the revelation I was about to make,&#xD;
that I quite forgot for a few moments the suppli-&#xD;
ant position that I was then occupying. ''You&#xD;
are quite right, sir, in thinking that he did&#xD;
not live up to the income he received while in&#xD;
your employ; scarce one-fifth of his salary was&#xD;
expended for his family's use ; how the balance&#xD;
was employed during the ten years in which we&#xD;
have lived so humbly, these papers may perhaps&#xD;
inform you;" and unlocking a secretary that&#xD;
stood in the room, I took from a drawer therein&#xD;
the package of receipts, given to my father at&#xD;
various times by those prisons to whom he had&#xD;
been indebted at the time of his failure. At&#xD;
that moment my trials and humiliations were&#xD;
nothing compared to the pride I felt in know-&#xD;
ing myself to be the daughter of dJames Man-&#xD;
vers.&#xD;
Mr. Henderson took the papers and glanced&#xD;
over them, at first carelessly, then more atten-&#xD;
tively, and finally eagerly and thoroughly. his&#xD;
face and voice expressed unmiingled astonish-&#xD;
ment as he turned to me at length. "And is it&#xD;
really possible," he said, ''that the amounts re-j&#xD;
ferred to in these papers are the former liabili-&#xD;
ties of the firm of ' Winthrop &amp;amp; Manvers ?' "&#xD;
"They are," I answered, "and their sum, I&#xD;
think, you will find completely covers the in-&#xD;
dehtedness with which that firm was charged.&#xD;
There is no man living this day who can just-&#xD;
ly say that my father ever wronged him of a&#xD;
cent."&#xD;
Mr. Henderson glanced sharply at me from&#xD;
under his spectacles as I stood haughtily before&#xD;
him, my cheeks flushed, my eyes flashing, iy&#xD;
habitual reserve quite deserting me, and it was&#xD;
in a tone of bitter significance very galling to&#xD;
my pride that lie added - '' And meanwhile,&#xD;
his orphan children are thrown destitute upon&#xD;
the world ! high-minded, honorable, Quixotic&#xD;
man !" Then noticing the color that angrily&#xD;
mounted in my cheeks, lie went on hastily:j&#xD;
" But there, there ; I will not intimate a word&#xD;
of censure; people regard such things very dif-&#xD;
ferently, I know ; though I should myself have&#xD;
been very unlikely to act as he has done, I yet&#xD;
can feel and appreciate the disinterested and&#xD;
peculiar magnanimity of his conduct; conduct&#xD;
of which I do not believe another man in Bos-&#xD;
ton would have been capable. Yet, after all,&#xD;
Miss Manvers, you see yourself that his honor-&#xD;
able conduct does not alter the fact that his&#xD;
children are left destitute.''&#xD;
'No," Ianswered, with indignant pride; "but&#xD;
it very mu1ch lightens the suffering of that des-&#xD;
titution. Believe ine or not, sir, had I this day&#xD;
in my possession flhe money of which those re-&#xD;
&#xD;
ceipts are the token, I would expeld it precisely&#xD;
as my father has done; nay, more ; if he had&#xD;
died, leaving his task inconple ed, it should&#xD;
have proved my duty, helpless woman though&#xD;
I am, to have fulfilled his design ; and to its ac-&#xD;
complishment, had it been necessary, I would&#xD;
have devoted the labor of my life.'&#xD;
"Oh! I believe you, I believe you !" cried&#xD;
Mr. Henderson hastily ; "there is enough of&#xD;
your father shining in your eyes this moment to&#xD;
make me credit you, had you asserted your de-&#xD;
termination to pay his debts twice over, just for&#xD;
the glory of the thing. But come, let us pro-&#xD;
ceed to rational business ; you and I must be&#xD;
good friends, Miss Caroline, for I loved your fa-&#xD;
ther, and you are his own child, verily.  Par-&#xD;
don my bluntness of speech, and tell me frankly&#xD;
what you wish me to do for you."&#xD;
The kind allusion to my father melted my&#xD;
pride at once; for I had sufficient penetration&#xD;
to see that the old gentleman's implied censure&#xD;
was more than balanced by the genuine admi-&#xD;
ration which I knew that he felt. I conquered&#xD;
the choking in my throat and the tremor in my&#xD;
voice sufficiently to say, "I must have employ-&#xD;
ment, sir ; something by which I can earn three&#xD;
or four hundred dollars a year--or less if I can&#xD;
not get that much ; if you can find this for me,&#xD;
I shall never forget to be grateful to you." .&#xD;
Mr. Henderson sat silent for a few moments.&#xD;
meditating, evidently upon what I had said.&#xD;
At last he turned toward the table upon which&#xD;
he had deposited my precious papers, and com-&#xD;
menced turning them rapidly over.  "An idea&#xD;
has just occurred to me," lie said briskly, "and&#xD;
one that I think likely will prove advantageous&#xD;
to you. I see upon these papers the signatures&#xD;
of your father's former creditors, many of them&#xD;
very wealthy men ; with several of these I am&#xD;
personally acquainted, and I have no doubt that&#xD;
if I speak to them, and acquaint them with the&#xD;
facts of the case, that there will be not a few&#xD;
who will so far appreciate the high-toned honor&#xD;
of your father's conduct, as to feel it a duty as&#xD;
pleasant as it would be binding, to provide for&#xD;
those whom the payment of their claims has&#xD;
left destitute."&#xD;
Unable to control the indignation his words&#xD;
excited, I started to my feet, crying passionately,&#xD;
"Destitute, perhaps, yet still not objects of char-&#xD;
ity, Mr. Henderson ! Little do you understand&#xD;
my father's daughter, and sadly indeed have you&#xD;
misinterpreted the spirit of my appeal to you,&#xD;
if you can imagine that pecuniary assistance&#xD;
from strangers is either desired or would be ac-&#xD;
cepted by me."&#xD;
"' There iieed he ino question of ch ruity in the&#xD;
&#xD;
matter," he began, a little sharply ; ''you have&#xD;
a right to their good offices, and they-"&#xD;
But I interrupted him haughtily. "I can not&#xD;
for a moment listen to you upon this subject,&#xD;
Mr. Henderson ; regard for my father's memory&#xD;
would render your idea an impracticable one,&#xD;
even did not my own self-respect lead me to&#xD;
protest against it most vehemently, as I do."&#xD;
He looked very uncomfortable; he would&#xD;
only have been punishing my insolent temper&#xD;
properly, had he left me to my own devices&#xD;
then and there, but such summary vengeance&#xD;
his kind heart forbade, and, much more kindly&#xD;
than I deserved, he continued to expostulate&#xD;
with me.   "You take a wrong view of the&#xD;
matter, entirely, my dear young lady; put the&#xD;
question to yourself ; suppose that by some obli-&#xD;
gation conferred upon you, another party had&#xD;
been grievously wronged ; should you not feel&#xD;
yourself called upon to remedy that wrong when&#xD;
it was made known to you? more especially,&#xD;
when you could do so at no loss or trouble to&#xD;
yourself?"&#xD;
"My father conferred no obligation upon his&#xD;
creditors, sir, in paying his just debts, nor did&#xD;
be wrong his children because he had no worldly&#xD;
goods to leave them.  The priceless treasure of&#xD;
his honorable name he did leave us, and that,&#xD;
by God's help, shall never be tarnished by word&#xD;
or deed of mine. Do not urge me farther, sir,",&#xD;
I said, seeing that he still seemed disposed to,&#xD;
continue the argument ; "your intention is&#xD;
kind, I know, and for that I most sincerely&#xD;
thank you; but my resolution is immovable ;&#xD;
independent of all save the advice and sympa-&#xD;
thy which I trust to obtain from you, I must&#xD;
and will remain."&#xD;
Mr. Henderson rose from his chair and slowly&#xD;
paced the room; he said nothing farther to me&#xD;
for some moments, and I, tired and uneasy, sat&#xD;
watching his restless movements, longing for.&#xD;
the interview to terminate, yet not courageous&#xD;
enough to disturb his cogitations by word or&#xD;
movement of mine. At last he halted abruptly&#xD;
in his walk and stood before me. "I am a lonely&#xD;
old man, Miss Manvers," he said, "homeless,&#xD;
wifeless, childless, I had almost said friendless,&#xD;
for though there are plenty of folks who invite&#xD;
me to their houses, and receive my presents, I&#xD;
fear were the balance at my banker's to lose&#xD;
the significant figures on the left of the ciphers,&#xD;
I should find but few of my many acquaintances&#xD;
left to love me., Were I a married man, had&#xD;
I a wife and home of my own, I should say to&#xD;
.you now, come home with me, you two little&#xD;
V   girls ; be my guests until you camn timid for your-&#xD;
selves a more congenial home, or as long as&#xD;
&#xD;
you can feel contented and happy in remaining&#xD;
with me ; but I can not do this now, for I re-&#xD;
side at a hotel and have no home to which I&#xD;
can invite you. But I like you, young lady, 1&#xD;
like you, and that little flaxen-headed one 1&#xD;
saw with you when I visited you before ; I liked&#xD;
your father before you, I trusted him, and I re-&#xD;
spected him as I never did another man in my&#xD;
life ; I see his features in your face ; I hear his&#xD;
voice when you speak; I recognize his spirit&#xD;
and his ways of thinking in every sentiment you&#xD;
utter.  I am tired of my lonely, aimless life ;&#xD;
let me claim you and the little one as my daugh-&#xD;
ters, Miss Caroline ; let me provide a home for&#xD;
you and myself too, and bring you to it, to&#xD;
comfort and to cheer me in my old age.'&#xD;
He paused, and gazed earnestly at me, his&#xD;
kind face beaming with benevolence, his manly&#xD;
voice husky with ill-repressed emotion.  I was&#xD;
so overpowered with astonishment at this un-&#xD;
looked-for speech that for a time I was quite&#xD;
unable to reply ; at last I managed to stammer&#xD;
forth, " You are very, very kind, Mr. Hender-&#xD;
son ; I can not thank you as I ought."&#xD;
''Then you accept my offer ?" he said eagerly ;&#xD;
"you will let me provide for you as if you were&#xD;
my own children ?"&#xD;
But I shook my head, though the tears stood&#xD;
in my eyes as I answered, "It must not be,&#xD;
sir; I have no words to thank you for your gen-&#xD;
erosity, but I shall be grateful for it while I live;&#xD;
do not think me insensible to your kindness,&#xD;
even though I must at once and decidedly check&#xD;
all such schemes in the start.  I must main-&#xD;
tain my independence, sir ; could I once be per-&#xD;
suaded to relinquish 'it, I should be miserable&#xD;
ever after ; and you know as well as I do, that&#xD;
only by earning my own livelihood by my daily&#xD;
toil, can I maintain it. I were blind indeed,&#xD;
could I not see that your motives for this pro-&#xD;
posal are my benefit, rather than your own eqm-&#xD;
fort, and I must decline it; nay! do not urge&#xD;
me, I beseech you ! farther discussion of the&#xD;
subject will only be painful both to you and to&#xD;
me-my decision is immovable."&#xD;
Again he turned from me, and walked up and&#xD;
down the room as if to gain time to conquer&#xD;
the angry words that I could see had risen to&#xD;
his lips ; at length he stood before me again,&#xD;
still a little flushed and excited.&#xD;
" What (10 you want sme to do for you then ?"&#xD;
he said bluntly. " Tell me what you require&#xD;
and what assistance you will receive, and I will&#xD;
do my best to oblige you."&#xD;
Tears rushed to imy eyes. "Find me some-&#xD;
thmimig to do, sir ; that is all I ask. I am a friendt-&#xD;

&#xD;
know, but I am young and healthy, have been&#xD;
pretty well educated, and I am a good plain&#xD;
sewer. I am willing and anxious to work, but&#xD;
I no more know where or how to find employ-&#xD;
ment than does little Agnes herself.  If you&#xD;
could only help me to getting a situation in a&#xD;
school; or would recommend me to some of&#xD;
your lady acquaintances who would be likely&#xD;
to provide rme with sewing ; in either way you&#xD;
would be doing me a far greater service than&#xD;
by persuading me to lead a life of idleness."&#xD;
Ile sat musingly for a few moments. "There&#xD;
is not much chance in the schools, I fear, at&#xD;
present. Spring is a bad time to seek employ-&#xD;
ment there ; the teachers, you know, are en-&#xD;
gaged in the fall, and generally for the year,&#xD;
unless a vacancy should happen to occur, and&#xD;
you could secure it. I (1o not know much about&#xD;
how these things are managed ; I have never&#xD;
had any thing to do with the school manage-&#xD;
ment, but I will see what I can do for you.&#xD;
Sewing, needle-work of any kind, is utterly out&#xD;
of the question.  I might as well recommend&#xD;
you to go hang yourself as to take to that for a&#xD;
living. You could not keep soul and body to-&#xD;
gether on a seamstress's wages.  What do you&#xD;
say to going into a store as saleswoman ?"&#xD;
" Any thing, sir ; I shall not be particular as&#xD;
to the mtanner of the employment if I may only&#xD;
be able to get at it immediately."  Yet my&#xD;
heart sank within inc as I answered, for there&#xD;
was not another respectable occupation imagin-&#xD;
able, it seemed to me then, that I would not&#xD;
rather have accepted than this. Not for worlds,&#xD;
however, would 1 have uttered an objection to&#xD;
any reasonable plan Mr. Ilenderson chose to&#xD;
propose.&#xD;
" Well, I svill see about it," lie said, rising&#xD;
and drawing on ihis gloves; " this will be rather&#xD;
more in my line than any thing else I can at&#xD;
present think of.  I have a pretty extensive ac-&#xD;
quaintance among the larger retail merchants&#xD;
of the city, and I think I may safely venture to&#xD;
promise you a situation with some pleasant, re-&#xD;
liable man, who will he willing to paty you liv-&#xD;
ing wages.  You. shall hear from ie shortly.&#xD;
Good-bye !" and my kind friend departed, leav-&#xD;
ing ne really uncertain whether to be pleased&#xD;
or vexed at the result of the interview.&#xD;
Two days later the expected note from Mr.&#xD;
Ilenderson arrived. IIe stated that lie had pro-&#xD;
cured for me a situation as saleswoman in a large&#xD;
wholesale and retail dry goods establishment on&#xD;
- Street, and that I would receive during the&#xD;
first six months the sum of five dollars per&#xD;
week, with the priospect of increased wages at&#xD;
time termimnationt of that period, if imy services&#xD;
&#xD;
gave satisfaction.  It was too late now to draw&#xD;
back even if I had felt the desire to do so ; but&#xD;
really, all minor emotions were so completely&#xD;
swallowed up in the one great fact that I had&#xD;
a sure and independent method of making a&#xD;
living at once laid out before me, that, in the&#xD;
great relief I felt in my new prospects, I forgot&#xD;
to shrink and tremble at the manner in which&#xD;
the relief was to be obtained. The public life&#xD;
which my new occupation would force upon me&#xD;
would have been repugnant to any girl young&#xD;
and inexperienced as I was, but to one of my&#xD;
shy, indolent temperament it was absolutely ter-&#xD;
rible. Nothing but stern necessity could have&#xD;
forced me to accept the life thus offered me; but&#xD;
I well knew that I had no alternative ; and re-&#xD;
solving, with all the will and energy my desper-&#xD;
ate circumstances inspired, that I would brave-&#xD;
ly and faithfully accept the duties thus forced&#xD;
upon me, I cast pride to the winds, and armed&#xD;
with Mr. Henderson's letter of introduction,&#xD;
sought the scene of my future labors, and en-&#xD;
joyed my 'first interview with my future employ-&#xD;
er. It was fortunate indeed for my self-satis-&#xD;
fied feeling of independence, that I did not know&#xD;
that the wages offered to me were nearly double&#xD;
those usually given to beginners like myself,&#xD;
and that it was to Mr. Henderson's generosity,&#xD;
after all, that I was indebted for so much of the&#xD;
comfort of my future life.  I never knew it un-&#xD;
til after his death, yet I can not resist paying to&#xD;
his memory the tribute of this passing acknowl-&#xD;
edgment.   A noble gentleman and a faithful&#xD;
friend he proved himself then anti always, to&#xD;
others no less than to myself.&#xD;
My new employer proved kind and gentleman-&#xD;
ly ; lie seemed interested in me, and asked me&#xD;
many questions, some of which, I thought, sa-&#xD;
voted strongly of impertinence. He introduced&#xD;
ume to several of the older ladies in his employ,&#xD;
andi finally handed me over to one of them to&#xD;
be initiated into the duties of my new office,&#xD;
and to make myself at hoie among the ac-&#xD;
quaintances thus formed with what celerity I&#xD;
might.&#xD;
"Nettleby &amp;amp; Son" was the name of the firm&#xD;
(of course I disguise frames, for the house of&#xD;
which I speak is still a flourishing one in Bos-&#xD;
ton); the " son," Mr. Frank Nettleby, was.sel-&#xD;
dom at home, and was known to but few of the&#xD;
employs, as he was always absent in Europe&#xD;
half of the year, sometimes much longer, at-&#xD;
tending to the foreign business of the house, and&#xD;
his own pleasures.  It was a large establish-&#xD;
nct, doing a vast business, and employing uip-&#xD;
svard of a hundred hands, about one-half of'&#xD;
whom were women. 'There was a foreman whio&#xD;
&#xD;
superintended the male employs, and a fore-&#xD;
woman who controlled the girls, and over all&#xD;
there was a "governor," a Mr. Harrington, who&#xD;
kept a general supervision over the whole estab-&#xD;
lishment, and walked about among the' various&#xD;
counters, in and out, all day, with a pencil and&#xD;
note-book in his hand, his keen eyes noting&#xD;
every thing that transpired within the building.&#xD;
He was accountable only to Mr. Nettleby, the&#xD;
head of the establishment, and that gentleman,&#xD;
having perfect confidence in him, was content to&#xD;
leave the whole management of the internal ar-&#xD;
rangements of the store entirely in Mr. Harring-&#xD;
ton's hands, who by this means came to be con-&#xD;
sidered as the most influential person in the es-&#xD;
tablishment.&#xD;
This is a brief description of "the store" in&#xD;
which a very important period of my life was&#xD;
destined to be passed ; and there, upon the Mon-&#xD;
day following my interview with Mr. Ilender-&#xD;
son, did I, nervous and heavy-hearted, repair ;&#xD;
and there and then did I enter upon the ea-&#xD;
gerly anticipated task of "earning my own liv-&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
CIIAPTER III.&#xD;
TILE CLOAK DEPARTMENT.&#xD;
TuE various commodities in which the firm&#xD;
of Nettleby &amp;amp; Son professed to deal, were dis-&#xD;
posed of at various counters, presided over, each,&#xD;
by as many hands as the particular branch of&#xD;
the business seemed to require. My province&#xD;
was the cloak and shawl room, and in that&#xD;
department I found three ladies beside myself&#xD;
engaged ; two of them were new-comers, and&#xD;
scarcely more experienced in the business than&#xD;
I; the third was the forewoman, who was prin-&#xD;
cipal in this department as well as general over-&#xD;
seer over all the other counters ; that is, though&#xD;
she had nothing at all to do with the business&#xD;
of the other counters, she was compelled, by&#xD;
.  virtue of her office, to see that they were kept&#xD;
in proper order, that the saleswomen conducted&#xD;
themselves properly toward their customers and&#xD;
each other, and to be arbitress in all the petty&#xD;
disputes that necessarily arose daily-among so&#xD;
many young and flighty aspirants to commercial&#xD;
honors.  She was a sister of "the governor,"&#xD;
Miss Jenny Harrington by name; a woman from&#xD;
forty to forty-five years of age, active, energetic,&#xD;
talkative, and quick-tempered.  She had been&#xD;
,; employed in the firm for twenty years of her&#xD;
-life, and was now regarded by her employers as&#xD;
an almost indispensable assistant in carrying onr&#xD;
Sthe business. To her were intrusted always&#xD;
&#xD;
the "new hands" as they entered the establish-&#xD;
ment, and all were required to submit to a pre-&#xD;
liminary training at her hands, erc they were&#xD;
allowed to take charge of any really responsible&#xD;
part of the business. She was shrewd and&#xD;
keen ; a little cross and domineering sometimes&#xD;
with the poor, frightened creatures she was ex-&#xD;
pected to tutor, though often so sadly tried by&#xD;
their carelessness and stupidity, that I really&#xD;
could scarcely wonder that her temper had be-&#xD;
come hasty and impatient. She had a kind&#xD;
heart though, and a generous affectionate dis-&#xD;
position, and I never had any thing to complain&#xD;
of at her hands. She was evidently, from some&#xD;
unknown cause, favorably disposed toward me&#xD;
from the first, and bore with my ignorance much&#xD;
more patiently than I had any right to expect.&#xD;
I soon learned to appreciate the sterling.wortlm&#xD;
of her character, and to look upon her as a re-&#xD;
liable friend and adviser.&#xD;
The shawl-room was, an enclosure rather apart&#xD;
from the main space devoted to the public, and&#xD;
was, from its comparative retirement, a very de-&#xD;
sirable place for beginners. Though as accessi-&#xD;
ble to all customers, of course, as the rest of the&#xD;
store, it was seldom entered save by those who&#xD;
wished to purchase the articles of which we were&#xD;
in charge, and thus I was spared much of the&#xD;
publicity I had so much    dreaded.   Oddly&#xD;
enough, however, the very fact that made the&#xD;
situation so pleasant a one to me, was the ob-&#xD;
jection which the other girls coat inually urged&#xD;
against it.  It was ''so lonely," "so quiet,"&#xD;
''so tiresome,"was the invariable cry ; and these&#xD;
causes, combined with the terror which Misc&#xD;
Harrington's sharp eyes and still sh arper tongue&#xD;
universally inspired among them, made it m-&#xD;
possible, without a great amount of grumbling&#xD;
and dissatisfaction, to fill any vacancies which&#xD;
occurred in the shawl-room, except by new-&#xD;
comers,&#xD;
Miss Harrington called my attention to this&#xD;
fact one day, about a month after I had entered&#xD;
the store.  I had been telling her how delighted&#xD;
I was at being kept free from the tumult and&#xD;
publicity of the main departments.&#xD;
Ah!" said she, ''you will get bravely over&#xD;
that, by and by. You green hands are all glad&#xD;
enough at first to get rid of being stared at by&#xD;
every body, but your bashfulness soon wears oil,&#xD;
* and in three months' time you are all as eager&#xD;
to see and to be seen as you at first are to get&#xD;
out of sight. You will be pestering' the gov-&#xD;
* ernor' in a little while, as well as the rest of&#xD;
them, to give you a livelier stand.'&#xD;
" Indeed nto!" said I decidedly. ''If I never&#xD;
leave the shawl-room except by my own request,&#xD;

&#xD;
you may depend upon being bothered with me&#xD;
for an indefinite time to come."&#xD;
"I wish I could be certain that you knew&#xD;
your own mind," she said eagerly ; then adding&#xD;
abruptly, "but I know you girls better by far&#xD;
than you know yourselves, so I will take no ad-&#xD;
vantage of you in your present mood."&#xD;
" You don't know me, Miss Harrington," I&#xD;
answered, a little indignantly, "if you think me&#xD;
so changeable or so whimsical as that. Believe&#xD;
me or not, I do assure you that I had rather&#xD;
work in here with you, than for double wages in&#xD;
any other part of the store."&#xD;
" You are sure of that now, are you ?" she&#xD;
cried. "If I secure you this place, youwon't be&#xD;
fretting and fidgeting for a change before three&#xD;
months are gone ? You are certain enough of&#xD;
your own mind to be willing to retain the sit-&#xD;
uation you now hold permanently, even though&#xD;
the prospect of rising to the head of a counter,&#xD;
which would be before you in any other depart-&#xD;
ment, will be quite denied you here? for I need&#xD;
hardly tell you that no one can become my su-&#xD;
perior here, and I shall never leave the store as&#xD;
long as I am able to work.  Take time to think,&#xD;
and don't decide hastily."&#xD;
" I should cheerfully accept all the conditions&#xD;
you name for the privilege of keeping as I now&#xD;
am, in the background," I said, laughing. " I&#xD;
assure you, Miss IHarrington, my only terror&#xD;
now is that I should be ousted from my position&#xD;
whether I will or iot, by Mr. Nettleby wishing&#xD;
to place new-comers under your superintendence,&#xD;
and to do that he will have to remove me to&#xD;
make room for them."&#xD;
" He shan't do it," she cried in her quick, pos-&#xD;
itive way. "It is none of his business, anyhow ;&#xD;
the governor' attends to all such matters as&#xD;
that, and 1 will have the matter definitely settled&#xD;
before I am a day older." And just then catching&#xD;
sight of " the governor" passing by the entrance&#xD;
to our department, she hailed hint: ' John ! let&#xD;
inc speak to you a moment when you can spare&#xD;
the time, will you ?'  lie nodded and passed&#xD;
on, and she resumed speaking to ine. "You&#xD;
see I have beei complaining for a good while&#xD;
back, both to JIohn and to Mr. Nettleby, that I&#xD;
have too much responsibility upon my hands.&#xD;
Together with imy duties as forewoman and the&#xD;
constant watching which the green hands of my&#xD;
own department require, I ami fairly worried to&#xD;
death sometimes. Mr. Nettlehy thinks, I sup-&#xD;
pose, because I am the oldest ,hand in the store,&#xD;
that I can work miracles; so I ant expected toj&#xD;
sell as much as ainy other counter does, and&#xD;
keel every thing imn fluriishinmg order, though&#xD;
every other department in the store has, beside&#xD;
&#xD;
the head, two and sometimes three or four ex-&#xD;
perienced saleswomen to manage it.   Now I&#xD;
must do every thing myself, as you know by this&#xD;
time, or let every thing go half done, and the&#xD;
mistakes that the green hands are continually&#xD;
making is all cast up to my account in the long&#xD;
run, I know. I have just made up my mind&#xD;
that I von't stand it. I am going to have an&#xD;
assistant here that I can place some dependence&#xD;
upon ; some one who has sense enough to sell a&#xD;
shawl to one customer and a cloak to another,&#xD;
without sending the bill for the shawl to the&#xD;
person who bought the cloak, and vice versa, as&#xD;
Sarah Conway did yesterday ; or who knows&#xD;
enough of arithmetic not to insist that three&#xD;
shawls at nine, fourteen, and twenty dollars re-&#xD;
spectively, amount to forty-five dollars, as Jose-&#xD;
phine ioyle did last week.  You don't know&#xD;
much yet, to be sure, but you always have your&#xD;
wits about you, and understand addition and&#xD;
subtraction; and as you never lose your temper&#xD;
when I tell you of your faults, I really think&#xD;
that in the course of a few months you will be&#xD;
able to do very nicely with me; and if we do&#xD;
learn to get along comfortably together, I am de-&#xD;
termined that you shall not be removed against&#xD;
your will, particularly to make room for-"&#xD;
"What do you want with me, Jenny ?" said&#xD;
the voice of "the governor" at the entrance, in-&#xD;
terrupting his sister's harangue at this interest-&#xD;
ing point.  "Be quick, please, for I am wanted&#xD;
at the book-keeper's desk."&#xD;
"I only wanted to tell you that I had found&#xD;
at last the assistant I had been looking for so&#xD;
long," said she.  "This is Caroline Manvers,&#xD;
who has been with me for about a month. I do&#xD;
not know whether or not you have ever particu-&#xD;
larly noticed her before ;" and, as if to make up&#xD;
for past negligence, Mr. Harrington then noticed&#xD;
me to such an extent that I felt the color rush-&#xD;
ing to my cheeks beneath the keen glance of his&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"What can I do for you and Miss Manvers ?'"&#xD;
lie said at length.&#xD;
"Just this," answered his sister.  "Miss&#xD;
Manvers likes her present situation, and I like&#xD;
her, so it is our mutual wish that she should re-&#xD;
main here permanently, and I want you. to let&#xD;
the arrangement be an understood thing, to draw&#xD;
up a written agreement to that effect if it is&#xD;
necessary."&#xD;
"1 do not suppose that it will be, but it shall&#xD;
be just as you please," said Mr. Harrington, and&#xD;
then as he walked away his sister added--&#xD;
"Mr. Ne ttleby never interferes with any of&#xD;
John's arrangements if they mire serious ones, so&#xD;
you may consider yourself a fixture here now."&#xD;
&#xD;
Thus the conversation terminated, and -myI&#xD;
position was thenceforth regarded by all asI&#xD;
definitely settled, and  every day made it a1&#xD;
pleasanter and an easier one for me. I learned&#xD;
to like Miss Harrington very much, and with&#xD;
the other girls in the store I was thrown very&#xD;
little in contact. Those in our own department&#xD;
vere continually being changed, one set rarely&#xD;
continuing with us more than a month at a&#xD;
time, and thus I formed no intimate acquaint-&#xD;
ance with any of them. With the young men&#xD;
engaged in the store I was even less associated,&#xD;
scarcely having acquaintance enough with any&#xD;
of them to warrant more than an occasional&#xD;
passing word of salutation.  With Mr. Harring-&#xD;
ton, however, I could not help but become better&#xD;
acquainted; associated as I was with his sister,&#xD;
this could scarcely be avoided, for he frequently&#xD;
stopped in his circuit of the store as he passed&#xD;
the shawl-room, and when he found us alone he&#xD;
would often tarry to chat awhile with her, and&#xD;
naturally with me also.  She was very fond of&#xD;
him, and he apparently of her.  Though she&#xD;
was at least ten years his senior, yet she seemed&#xD;
to look up to him with unb unided respect ; and&#xD;
all that "John" said or   id was lawful and&#xD;
right in her sight. All her hopes and affections&#xD;
seemed to be centred in im and a younger&#xD;
brother, "Eddie" she calle I him, of whom she&#xD;
often talked to me as we became better ac-&#xD;
quainted ; but though she s oke of the latter af-&#xD;
fectionately, it was not with the same tone of&#xD;
proud deference which she  sed in speaking of&#xD;
"the governor."&#xD;
Mr. Nettleby I seldom s.aw, yet I heard him,&#xD;
much more frequently, I suppose, than he had&#xD;
any idea of. His desk w s situated immedi-&#xD;
ately in front of the shawl-room, which, by the&#xD;
bye, was not a regularly 11thed and plastered&#xD;
apartment; it was merely one end of the store&#xD;
separated from the principal department by a&#xD;
frame-work some eight feet in height, curtained&#xD;
on one side by cloaks and shawls, on the oppo-&#xD;
site by the curtains, etc., of he upholstering deo&#xD;
partnment. Of course all that transpired upon the&#xD;
one side could be plainly heard upon the other,&#xD;
and I had the benefit of many a conversation&#xD;
between Mr. Nettleby and he various person-&#xD;
ages who frequented his d sk, which I should&#xD;
have been much better pleased could I have es&#xD;
caped from hearing.  This, however, was hard&#xD;
ly possible.  When Miss H rrington was in th&#xD;
cloak-room, she with her race of pupils wam&#xD;
usually stationed at that sile of it nearest tc&#xD;
the entrance, and, except whenm we were over&#xD;
sun with customers, it was ,my ditty to renmati&#xD;
at the opposite side, where I took charges of thu&#xD;
&#xD;
clerkly labors of the department, Miss Harring-&#xD;
ton having, by degrees, as she found my knowl-&#xD;
edge of addition and subtraction warranted it,&#xD;
submitted to my hands the entire superintend-&#xD;
ence of the bills and payments, and all the bus-&#xD;
iness transactions requiring the attention of an&#xD;
educated person.&#xD;
Thus it happened that, as I sat at my counter&#xD;
with pencil and memoranda before me, day afier&#xD;
day, I was perforce obliged to hear all that&#xD;
went on at the desk which was separated from&#xD;
mine only by a silken curtain and a cashmere&#xD;
shawl. &#xD;
I do not remember having yet said any thing&#xD;
about the personal appearance of my employ-&#xD;
er. He was a man upward of fifty, I suppose,&#xD;
for Miss Harrington told me that his son, Mr.&#xD;
Frank Nettleby, was five-and-twenty; but he&#xD;
did not look a day over forty ; he was tall,&#xD;
finely formed, a little inclined to corpulency,&#xD;
with bright blue eyes, brown curly hair, and&#xD;
heavy side-whiskers ; both hair and whiskers&#xD;
being as yet quite guiltless of grey. To his den-&#xD;
tist he was indebted for a faultless set of teeth ;&#xD;
to his tailor for costume irreproachable in cut&#xD;
and texture ; and to nature for a dashing gen-&#xD;
tlemanly air, and the gift of language in perfec-&#xD;
tion. Such a talker as he was ! and so inquisi-&#xD;
tive ! Upon my first interview with him, as I&#xD;
intimated, I had been inclined to consider his&#xD;
questions and himself as rather impertinent;&#xD;
but as I learned to know him better, I found&#xD;
that this questioning habit had become second&#xD;
nature to him, and that all strangers who came&#xD;
under his notice were submitted to it, as far as&#xD;
! they would stand it, without respect of sex or&#xD;
station. He was a good-humored, charitable&#xD;
man, easily imposed upon, and unable to say&#xD;
"no" to any of the scores of petitioners who&#xD;
daily beset his desk. Had it not been for the&#xD;
stricter discipline of Mr. Harrington, chaos must&#xD;
soon have reigned in the now orderly precincts&#xD;
of the store. Mr. Nettleby was a widower, and&#xD;
- his son Frank was his only ehild ; lie was a&#xD;
man of fashion and of pleasure; not addicted&#xD;
to any particular vice, that I ever heard of, but&#xD;
fond of racing, boating, billiards, theatricals,&#xD;
- and with all such tastes as mark the man of the&#xD;
I world. Many a bet was booked ; many a&#xD;
- doubtful bargain concluded; many not overele-&#xD;
- gant anecdotes related by him or some of the&#xD;
e many fashionable gentlemen who visited his&#xD;
s desk during the hours in which I sat at my&#xD;
o counter behind him; and at last, really dreading&#xD;
- that I might thuts inadvertently overheatr some-&#xD;
nthing that Mr. Nettleby would not wish to have&#xD;
known, I spoke to Miss Hlarrington about it,&#xD;

&#xD;
and asked whether I had better not inform Mr.&#xD;
Nettleby of my vicinity.&#xD;
"You will be laughed at for your pains, if&#xD;
you do, my dear," she replied ; "I formerly&#xD;
occupied your position, and was annoyed in the&#xD;
same manner; so I one day told Mr. Nettleby&#xD;
of the circumstance, showing him just how the&#xD;
screen between us was arranged, and how im-&#xD;
possible it was that I should avoid overhearing&#xD;
all that was said. ' Overhear as much as you&#xD;
like, he said, laughing;' 'if you can stand it, I&#xD;
am sure I can;' and that was all the satisfac-&#xD;
tion I could get out of him."&#xD;
Thus I was compelled to let the matter rest ;&#xD;
but if I had any remaining doubts about the&#xD;
light in which Mr. Nettleby regarded my vicin-&#xD;
ity, they were settled definitely by an incident&#xD;
which occurred a few weeks after my conversa-&#xD;
tion with Miss 11arrington.&#xD;
It was a stormy morning; there had not&#xD;
been a dozen customers in since we opened the&#xD;
store. Miss Ilarrington taking advantage of&#xD;
this lull of business, as was her custom, had&#xD;
had hauled down a vast quantity of goods at the&#xD;
end of the apartment farthest from  me, and&#xD;
with the aid of her two assistants, was rear-&#xD;
ranging them according to her ideas of right&#xD;
and convenience.  I was busily engaged copy-&#xD;
ing a paper containing an account of stock,&#xD;
taken in Miss IIarringtou's crabbed, angular&#xD;
handwriting, a  writing  that now   seldom&#xD;
emerged from our domains, since she had made&#xD;
the discovery that I was a tolerably fair pen-&#xD;
ian.&#xD;
man.&#xD;
Outside sat Mr. Nettlehy, with his chair&#xD;
pushed so far back against the screen that di-&#xD;
vided him from me, that I expected momentari-&#xD;
ly to see it thrown down. Ie was engaged in&#xD;
an exciting conversation with a dog-fancier,&#xD;
concerning a choice litter of Pups of which the&#xD;
latter was anxious to dispose.&#xD;
'' And t don't want the cursed things at any&#xD;
price," was the elegant Peroration with which&#xD;
Mr. Nettleby wound up a long and disparaging&#xD;
harangue concerning the animals in question.&#xD;
Come, now ! really, Mr. Nettleby, you&#xD;
mustn't expect me to believe that," rejoined&#xD;
the coarse voice of the man with whom he was&#xD;
conversing. ''No genelman who knows what's&#xD;
what, as well as you does, can see them hani-&#xD;
mals and not want them.  I know you, sir, bet-&#xD;
ter than you knows yourself. When that white&#xD;
and tan opened his eyes, the first thing I says&#xD;
was ' Mr. Nettleby's the man for that chap !' I&#xD;
hiad 'ema all laid out in my mind, you see, for&#xD;
different customers ; but when that tother tan&#xD;
growed so amazing party, thinks I ' It's a sin to&#xD;
&#xD;
part 'em.'  I had laid him out, you see, for&#xD;
George Le Grange, and lie's the man that&#xD;
could appreciate him too; but I haint yet said&#xD;
nothing to him about it, and if so be you'd&#xD;
like to have the pair on 'em, Mr. Nettleby, I&#xD;
will try what else I can do for Mr. Le Grange.&#xD;
Come, now! let's strike a bargain; if you're&#xD;
for taking the critters, I aint the man to let the&#xD;
matter of a V more or less cross your fancy."&#xD;
"The black and tan you say is marked like&#xD;
Flora?" queried Mr. Nettleby, evidently relht-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"Eggsactly !" rejoined the other with anima-&#xD;
tion ; "two fore-legs and tip of the tail black--"&#xD;
"No!" interrupted the gentleman; "only one&#xD;
of Flora's fore-legs was black."&#xD;
"Not wishing to contradict, sir, you're tee-&#xD;
totally out there. Lord! I've handled the crit-&#xD;
ter enough to know the color of every hair on&#xD;
her body. Her two fore-legs was black, sir, one&#xD;
to the knee, tether to the shoulder."&#xD;
"I tell you no, man ! the left leg was tan ; 1&#xD;
could swear to it," again interrupted Mr. Nettle-&#xD;
by, and in the excitement of the interesting dis-&#xD;
cussion lie gave his chair the final hitch which&#xD;
I had so long been dreading, and down came&#xD;
curtains and shawls upon our heads, enveloping&#xD;
us both in the ruins. We could not help but&#xD;
laugh, for the situation was certainly a ludicrous&#xD;
one; however, extricating ourselves from our&#xD;
superfluous drapery as gracefully as might be,&#xD;
we started to repair damages-Mr. Nettleby first&#xD;
dismissing his trading friend, the innocent cause&#xD;
of our present embarrassment, with language&#xD;
more decisive than refined.&#xD;
"Don't let us interrupt you in your neces-&#xD;
sary avocations, Miss Jenny," lie said, grace-&#xD;
fully waving that lady back, as she started to&#xD;
come to our assistance ; "I will attend to this&#xD;
upholstery business myself; I have nothing bet-&#xD;
ter to do, and I am perfectly competent to the&#xD;
task, I assure you. Iallo ! you, sir," bailing&#xD;
one of the innumerable small boys that were&#xD;
appurtenances of the store, and who now stood&#xD;
gaping with open eyes and mouths at the de-&#xD;
struction wrought by their employer; ''go yon&#xD;
and hunt up a hammer and some nails. I will&#xD;
nail this damask up myself this time, and I&#xD;
know that then I shall not be able again to in-&#xD;
vade so unceremoniously the privacy of your&#xD;
domains. By the bye, Miss Manvers, if I may&#xD;
venture the question, what is your opinion of&#xD;
the color of that dog's leg ?"&#xD;
I laughed in spite of my vexation, and Mr.&#xD;
Nettleby seemed to enjoy the joke vastly, so in&#xD;
high good-himhor he proceeded to gather up the&#xD;
scattered drapery.&#xD;

&#xD;
Just then "the governor" came along, and&#xD;
without asking any questions, seemed to under-&#xD;
stand at once what had happened.  "Had you&#xD;
not better allow me to attend to that, Mr. Net-&#xD;
tleby ?" he said.&#xD;
"Certainly not," briskly returned that gen-&#xD;
tleman; "but you may watch and see how it&#xD;
ought to have been done in the first place. -I&#xD;
will have no assistance except what Miss Man-&#xD;
vers I dare say will benevolently afford me. If&#xD;
you will be good enough to hold this corner of&#xD;
the damask, Miss Manvers, I will keep the other&#xD;
side in its place until the hammer comes.&#xD;
So, obedient to his directions, I held the fold&#xD;
of crimson on a level with my head upon a bar&#xD;
of the frame to which he designed to nail it,&#xD;
"What a pretty hand you have !" he said,&#xD;
checking his operations abruptly and gazing&#xD;
admiringly upon the hand and arm thus con-&#xD;
spicuously forced into notice.  "I beg your&#xD;
pardon, but really I could not avoid speaking&#xD;
of it; small, well-shaped and white-we do not&#xD;
often see those three combinations-and with&#xD;
rounded wrist, tapering fingers, and filbert nails,&#xD;
too; really you have every reason to be proud&#xD;
of such a hand." And thus he went on with&#xD;
cool impertinence, criticising and commenting&#xD;
until I was ready to cry with vexation. Fortu-&#xD;
nately the boy arrived with the hammer just&#xD;
then, so I hoped that I should be tormented&#xD;
with no farther remarks. He nailed his own&#xD;
corner of the damask and proceeded leisurely&#xD;
toward my end, driving a tack every few inches.&#xD;
Half way down, however, he stopped and re-&#xD;
commenced his attack.&#xD;
"From which side of the house do you in-&#xD;
herit that hand, Miss Manvers ? Did you not&#xD;
know that fine hands and feet are always hered-&#xD;
itary?  Do you get yours from your father's or&#xD;
mother's family ?"&#xD;
"From my father's, I believe ; please, Mr.&#xD;
Nettleby, don't talk about it any more. Do you&#xD;
think it is necessary to put those tacks so close&#xD;
together ?" I said, desperately endeavoring, if&#xD;
not to check his loqIacity, at least to change&#xD;
its direction. But the distraction was but tem-&#xD;
porary, and he instantly resumed, driving an-&#xD;
other tack as he spoke.&#xD;
"On the contrary, I was just thinking that I&#xD;
had not driven them quite close enough ; but I&#xD;
can easily put a few more in if it is necessary.&#xD;
So you inherited your pretty hand from your&#xD;
father's family, did you? I thought so ; I have&#xD;
an acquaintance whose hand resembles yours&#xD;
very much; that is, it is similarly shaped, andI&#xD;
think as white, though by no means so small as&#xD;
yours. She inherits hers from her father ; she&#xD;
&#xD;
is a Wilberforce, comes of a fine old family, you&#xD;
see ; a faultless hand is an indubitable'sign of&#xD;
good blood, Miss Manvers, did you know that ?"&#xD;
Even while he was speaking a low voice&#xD;
sounded in my ear, ''I do not "believe the task&#xD;
Mr. Nettleby has imposed upon you is an agree-&#xD;
able one ; may I not relieve you ?" And turn-&#xD;
ing, I saw Mr. Ilarrington standing by my side,&#xD;
ready to take from my hand the damask I had&#xD;
just mentally resolved to drop, at the risk of&#xD;
discomposing all Mr. Nettleby's arrangements.&#xD;
" Oh ! thank you, yes sir !" I cried, and flushed&#xD;
and excited, I resigned to him my position and&#xD;
turned thankfully away ; yet vexed as I was, I&#xD;
could not help noticing that Mr IIarrington&#xD;
seemed scarcely less indignant at his principal's&#xD;
want of delicacy than I was niyself.&#xD;
Mr. Nettleby made no effort to detain me,&#xD;
and never afterward alluded to the incident in&#xD;
any way, but it was long ere I heard the last&#xD;
of "The Wilberforce hand" from the girls in&#xD;
the store, and the whole affair was a subject of&#xD;
annoyance to me for weeks after.&#xD;
Time rolled on, and I believe no event of&#xD;
sufficient importance to record transpired dur-&#xD;
ing the first year of my employment in the firm&#xD;
of Nettleby &amp;amp; Son ; unless perhaps it was the&#xD;
arrival, toward the close of the year, of Mr.&#xD;
Frank Nettleby.&#xD;
This gentleman was a younger duplicate of&#xD;
his father, and not much younger either, if&#xD;
looks were to be believed, for while Mr. Nettle-&#xD;
by, senior, was avery young-looking man for his&#xD;
age, his son was decidedly the reverse.  No&#xD;
person glancing casually at him would have&#xD;
thought him less than thirty ; he wits about his&#xD;
father's height, not quite so broad, however, with&#xD;
the same brown curly hair, side-whiskers, and&#xD;
bright blue eyes ; of munch the same tempera-&#xD;
ment too, I thought, for a more jovial, light-&#xD;
hearted, good-tempered fellow could scarcely be&#xD;
found than our junior partner. lie and his fa-&#xD;
ther would have anywhere been mistaken for&#xD;
brothers, and this was a relationshipp that the&#xD;
older gentleman was quite disposed to=counte-&#xD;
nance. It was an odd connection that existed&#xD;
between them, and yet no one doubted but that&#xD;
they were sincerely and warmly attached to&#xD;
each other ; but they had very queer ways of ex-&#xD;
pressing themselves, notwithstanding.  While&#xD;
Mr. Nettleby almost always addressed his son&#xD;
as "F. N.," that worthy as universally spoke&#xD;
of and to his father by the title of "Partner."&#xD;
I overheard once from my station behind the&#xD;
curtain a coniversations which illustrated the 1e-&#xD;
lationship of my two employers better than ans&#xD;
niere description of mine can do.-&#xD;

24                           MY HUSBAl&#xD;
Mr. Harrington had been remonstrating with&#xD;
Mr. Nettleby, senior, concerning some of his&#xD;
son's delinquencies.  "Do exert your authority&#xD;
over Frank, Mr. Nettleby," said "the governor,"&#xD;
"and at least find out for me whether he has&#xD;
brought with him copies of the bills for the goods&#xD;
that were received last week ; the bills that were&#xD;
forwarded are evidently incorrect, and I can not&#xD;
persuade him to compare them with those he&#xD;
holds, or ought to hold. If you would just pre-&#xD;
vail upon hii to take a search among his pa-&#xD;
pers, and find out at least if he has the dupli-&#xD;
cates, it would save us all an amazing amount&#xD;
of labor and vexation."&#xD;
" Now, Iarrington ! where is the use in&#xD;
making such an appeal to me !" returned Mr.&#xD;
Nettleby in an injured tone. "If you chose to&#xD;
talk about my junior's exerting his authority&#xD;
over me, there would be some sense in what you&#xD;
are saying. You know very well F. N. does as&#xD;
he pleases ; always did, and always will.  lie&#xD;
was an older man than I when lie left school,&#xD;
and the idea of me prevailing upon a fellow who&#xD;
has spent six months out of each of the last six&#xD;
years of his life in Paris, to do any thing he has&#xD;
not a mind to do, is absolutely preposterous.&#xD;
T he error in the bills is as much his affhir as it&#xD;
is mine, and lie knows it ; if there is a loss, he&#xD;
will sufler by it; and if die fear of loss won't&#xD;
make him observe the proper precautions with&#xD;
his bills and receipts, it is really absurd to ex-&#xD;
pect that the remonstrances of his partner would&#xD;
be more effectual."&#xD;
The odd argument here closed, and I regret&#xD;
to add that I never found out whether Mr. Frank&#xD;
produced the missing duplicates or not.&#xD;
My home life had proved throughout this&#xD;
passing year still more uneventful than my pub-&#xD;
lie one. Agnes had attended school steadily,&#xD;
and I really saw but little of the child except at&#xD;
meal-time.  She was always a sleepy-headed&#xD;
little thing, and found it hard work to stay awake&#xD;
in the evenings long enough to prepare her les-&#xD;
sons for the next day's school ; so she always&#xD;
gave me her good-night kiss, and ran off to bed&#xD;
long before I was able to retire, for I had the&#xD;
sewing to attend to in the evening, both hers and&#xD;
my own, and this generally kept me busy until ai&#xD;
pretty late bed-time.&#xD;
I became terribly lonely during those long,&#xD;
dull, wearisome evenings at home; I often would&#xD;
read over in the newspapers the advertised&#xD;
amusements of the day, longing with all the&#xD;
eager curiosity of youth for the opportunity to&#xD;
see and to hear the wonderful things I read of.&#xD;
I was always fond of theatricals, though the&#xD;
nmmberof plays I had seen I could have counted&#xD;

on the fingers of one hand ; perhaps it was be-&#xD;
cause they were such a novelty to me that I&#xD;
longed so ardently to behold them, and bitter&#xD;
feelings of repining would rise in my heart,&#xD;
when I thought how utterly impossible it was&#xD;
that I should ever have any opportunity of en-&#xD;
joying that which would have been such a&#xD;
source of delight to me. Very, very hard it&#xD;
seemed to me that all joy, all pleasure, natural&#xD;
to my age, should have been denied to me, and&#xD;
I grew morose and low-spirited, brooding over&#xD;
my deprivations until I was almost shocked at the&#xD;
extent of the discontent which had grown upon&#xD;
me. The lonely, quiet evenings did not tend&#xD;
to lessen the reserve of my disposition; this liv-&#xD;
ing upon my own thoughts, ever mourning over&#xD;
the past, ever hopeless of the future, was likely&#xD;
to prove pregnant with serious results for me.&#xD;
I began to grow morbid; I dreamed at night of&#xD;
father and Sue continually, and finally I began&#xD;
to fancy that their frequent appearance in my&#xD;
visions was a token of my own approaching&#xD;
death, and my health really began to give way&#xD;
beneath the influence of such presentiments. I&#xD;
wrote a long letter to Mr. Henderson, accepting&#xD;
for Agnes the favors I had declined for myself,&#xD;
and this letter I laid carefully by in the secre-&#xD;
tary, along with those sacred receipts, my fa-&#xD;
ther's legacy to his children, to be given to Ag-&#xD;
nes after my death.&#xD;
It was with these feelings of hopeless de-&#xD;
spondency, these presentiments of impending&#xD;
death, that my twentieth birthday found me en-&#xD;
grossed ; and in one particular at lesst, these&#xD;
presentiments were destined to be realized, for&#xD;
the ensuing year proved to be, as I had fore-&#xD;
boded, the most important of my life.&#xD;
CIIAPTER IV.&#xD;
AN EVENING AT hOME.&#xD;
My first interview with Mr. Frank Nettleby&#xD;
was after this wise : I think it was the second&#xD;
day after his return he went the round of the&#xD;
store, stopping to chat at each counter with such&#xD;
of the employs as he remembered, claiming&#xD;
introductions to the new hands, and winning for&#xD;
himself golden opinions from all.&#xD;
In his rounds he stopped, of course, at the&#xD;
shawl-room, and leaning his handsome head&#xD;
against the door-way, ie stood looking in upon&#xD;
us, with good-humored face and laughing eyes.&#xD;
" Still there ! Miss Jenny," he cried; "so&#xD;
none of your many admirers have yet persuaded&#xD;
you to leave us, and you are Miss Jenny still ?"&#xD;
" I ani-still sanie," shte retorted dryly, and he&#xD;
&#xD;
went on laughingly.  "Yes, yes! I have not the other departments ; I have never heretofore&#xD;

MY HUSBAND'S CRIME.&#xD;
&#xD;
nes, it was better that Miss Ilarrington should&#xD;
caine to mue, andl so I told her.&#xD;
" Well, then, shut up the books ; we will no&#xD;
worry over them any longer now.  Let me see&#xD;
to-night is our prayer-meeting ; it will not d&#xD;
for me to miss it, but I will come to-morrow&#xD;
eight early, and I know we can do more in on&#xD;
hour quietly at home, than we can accomplish&#xD;
by a day's work here," and thus the matter wa&#xD;
disposed of-.&#xD;
Now that I look back upon that time, I car&#xD;
scarcely credit, myself, the excitement with&#xD;
which so unimportant an event as this visit wa&#xD;
anticipated by inc-my first expected visit&#xD;
since Mr. Ilienderson's call more than a yeas&#xD;
before ; and perhaps the simple announcement&#xD;
of this fact may better enable the reader to un&#xD;
derstandt how lonely andi isolated a life I lhad&#xD;
been leading than could any other assertion.&#xD;
I hurried home from the store earlier than&#xD;
usual that night, that I might embellish my&#xD;
parlor with a little extra attention in honor of&#xD;
the expected guests.  So long had it been since&#xD;
I had entertained company, that the unusual&#xD;
circumstance awakened in me a pleasurable&#xD;
excitement to which I had long been a stran-&#xD;
ger. My parlor swept and dusted, and iy own&#xD;
simple toilet completed, I then tacked fresh&#xD;
laces to the sleeves and neck of Agnes's little&#xD;
black dress, and arranged with more than or-&#xD;
dinarv care the long goldoi ringlets that adorn-&#xD;
ed her beautiful head, and then, with my table&#xD;
drawn i front of the fire, with the store books&#xD;
and papers conveniently disposed upon it, with&#xD;
Agnes settled industriously at her school-books,&#xD;
I waited in patient expectation the arrival of&#xD;
my guest. I was not long detained ; soon there&#xD;
came a ring at the bell which sounded like Miss&#xD;
Jenny's veritable self, and when I opened the&#xD;
door she stood before me, lively, active, and&#xD;
talkative as ever.&#xD;
" Yes, I am alone, child," she said, seeing&#xD;
my look of surprise that she was unaccompa-&#xD;
ied, for though early, it was quite dark. " John&#xD;
has just left me ; he brought me to the step,&#xD;
but lie had business down town yet this even-&#xD;
ing, so lie was obliged to leave me.  He will&#xD;
call for me at ten."&#xD;
I ushered her into the parlor, and soon saw&#xD;
her comfortably seated in an arm-chair by the&#xD;
table.  " Why !" she exclaimed, upon seeing&#xD;
Agnes, ''is this little one the sister of whom&#xD;
you have so often spoken ? I had thought of&#xD;
her as being an older child than she evidently&#xD;
is."&#xD;
"Agnes is thirteen, though she looks so&#xD;
young and childishi," I said, smuiling. "' She&#xD;
&#xD;
d has always been our pet and baby, and I am&#xD;
not sorry to keep her a child as long as possi-&#xD;
t ble ;" and then as my little girl put her hand in&#xD;
, Miss Jenny's and raised her beautiful blue eyes&#xD;
o timidly to the lady's face, she could not resist&#xD;
stooping and kissing affectionately the sweet&#xD;
e mouth thus turned toward her.&#xD;
h    "She is a dear little girl and a great com-&#xD;
s fort to you, I have no doubt," she said. "It has&#xD;
always been a matter of regret with me that I&#xD;
have had no sister ; it would have been great&#xD;
h company for me during my lonely life. The&#xD;
s boys have been as good and kind to me as boys&#xD;
r could be, but I have often wished that Eddie&#xD;
r had been a girl."&#xD;
t After a little more chat we set to work with&#xD;
- our accounts, and worked at them so industri-&#xD;
. ously that when the door-bell rang, announcing&#xD;
the arrival of Mr. Harrington, his sister glanced&#xD;
at her watch, scarcely able to believe that the&#xD;
evening had so far advanced.&#xD;
" Half past nine !" said shse; "I had no idea&#xD;
it was so late, though John is rather earlier&#xD;
than I told him to be."&#xD;
I escorted Mr. Harrington to the parhov ;&#xD;
lhe paused a moment in the door-way, his tall&#xD;
head almost touching the humble lintel.&#xD;
"And this is your home ?" he said almost&#xD;
unconsciously, glancing first over the room and&#xD;
then at me, with that kind, cordial expression&#xD;
in his eyes that made him at times so much&#xD;
resemble Isis sister.&#xD;
"It looks much more like home than our&#xD;
boarding-house rooms do, don't you think so,&#xD;
John ?' said Miss Harrington ; and then, with-&#xD;
out waiting for an answer, she went on impuls-&#xD;
ively, "But, poor fellow ! he does not even&#xD;
know what home ought to look like ! He has&#xD;
lived in a boarding-house ever since he was ten&#xD;
years old."&#xD;
"I have my ideas on the subject, notwithi&#xD;
standing," he said quietly. "This little maid&#xD;
is your sister, I suppose, Miss Harrington ?" and&#xD;
as Agnes rose to return his greetings, he took&#xD;
her rosy face between his hands and gazed at&#xD;
her with a look in his eyes that few would have&#xD;
imagined those stern, quiet orbs capable of ex-&#xD;
pressing. And Agnes seemed to understand&#xD;
it too, for with that peculiar freemasonry&#xD;
which children possess in common with the&#xD;
other orders of the brute creation, she recog-&#xD;
nized in him a friend; and drawing her low&#xD;
chair close to his, before ie had been in the&#xD;
house half an hour, she was nestled cosily to&#xD;
liis side, with his arm around her, and her hand&#xD;
clasped us Isis ; ans unprecedented piece of con-&#xD;
descension in my shy, wild little sister.&#xD;
&#xD;
AN EVENING AT HOME.                                    1&#xD;
I brought in a plate of apples and passed a moment's pause ; "yet I need not ask the&#xD;
them around, and as Miss Harrington sat question, for the shape of your forehead is suifli-&#xD;

28                  MY HUSBAND'S CRIME.&#xD;
&#xD;
The next evening, arrayed in the plain bla&#xD;
silk which was the only attempt at dress of&#xD;
which my mourning wardrobe could boast,&#xD;
received Mr. Harrington again beneath my roof&#xD;
Agnes had gone to stay with a school-mate, tht&#xD;
daughter of a kind neighbor, with whom she in&#xD;
tended to remain until Ireturned, and was muc&#xD;
more delighted in expectation with her visi&#xD;
than I was with -mine--for my old shyness wa&#xD;
creeping back upon me quite overpoweringly at&#xD;
the idea of appearing so soon in the presence of&#xD;
so many strangers. However, I had no time foi&#xD;
faltering, for Mr. Harrington bore to me his sis&#xD;
ter's injunction that I should lose no time, and&#xD;
soon, hooded and shawled, I left the house un-&#xD;
der his protection.&#xD;
It had been so long since I had been in the&#xD;
street after night, that this sensation alone was&#xD;
quite a novelty to me, and so I told my com-&#xD;
panion.&#xD;
" You poor little hermit !" he said, almost&#xD;
involuntarily, "no wonder you are becoming&#xD;
so shadow-like!  At least you shall have a&#xD;
good look at the streets to-night, if so trivial&#xD;
a circumstance can give you pleasure."  And&#xD;
choosing the principal thoroughfares in our&#xD;
progress, we walked slowly and leisurely along,&#xD;
I feeling really delighted at the bright spectacle&#xD;
of the gas-liglitef streets and showily-decorated&#xD;
shop-windows, clinging timidly to the arm of&#xD;
my escort, and feeling momentarily a growing&#xD;
sense of comfort and protection in his conpan-&#xD;
ionship that was not the least delightful of all&#xD;
the novel sensations of that memorable evening.&#xD;
Arrived at last, decidedly to my regret, at&#xD;
our destination, Mr. Harrmington escorted me at&#xD;
once to his sister's room.  She was reading&#xD;
when we entered, but laying aside her' book,&#xD;
greeted me very kindly, and after relieving me&#xD;
of my wraJ))igs, introduced me to her young&#xD;
brother, Edwin Harrington, a boy apparently of&#xD;
eighteen or twenty, who had been seated by the&#xD;
table reading as we entered.&#xD;
I glanced rather curiously at this new ac-&#xD;
(unintance, for I felt really interested in the&#xD;
boy, having heard his sister speak of him so fre-&#xD;
qiughtly and so aTcetionately. lie was tall, but&#xD;
slightly built, anI seemed to be in very deli-&#xD;
cate health, lIe had a fair, beardless face,&#xD;
high white forehead, light hair and blue eyes.&#xD;
By many persons I dare say he would have been&#xD;
regarded as strikingly handsome, but his was by&#xD;
no means a style of beauty that I admired; he&#xD;
inl no respect resembled either Miss Jenny or&#xD;
when it is exlIlained that he wsassil rearkablf-&#xD;
brother, his another having ee vaDr. Harming-&#xD;
&#xD;
k ton's second wife. He shook hands with me,&#xD;
and his hands'seemed as soft and slender as my&#xD;
I own, and his voice, when he spoke to me, fairly&#xD;
startled me, so musically feminine were its tones;&#xD;
e upon the whole, I could but agree with Miss&#xD;
- Jenny in thinking that it was a pity Eddie had&#xD;
h not been a girl. How little could I then guess&#xD;
t the feelings of respect and admiration I was&#xD;
s afterward destined .to feel for that seemingly&#xD;
t effeminate boy !&#xD;
. The first two hours of my visit were devoted&#xD;
r to the inevitable accounts; but with "the gov-&#xD;
- ernor's" assistance we made such rapid headway&#xD;
1 with them that I declared my ability to finish&#xD;
- the rest of the work without any farther assist-&#xD;
ance.&#xD;
Work finished, Mr. Harrington escorted his&#xD;
sister and myself to the parlor, Eddie still&#xD;
choosing to remain with the book to which he&#xD;
had devoted his undivided attention throughout&#xD;
t the evening. In the parlor I was introduced to&#xD;
many persons, both ladies and gentlemen, and&#xD;
at last,,overpowered by the many st ange faces,&#xD;
I shrank timidly to Miss Harrington's side,&#xD;
scarcely able to raise my eyes, or to respond&#xD;
with more than monosyllables to all the civil&#xD;
speeches that were made to me. "Thy governor"&#xD;
was evidently a man of mark in his own circle,&#xD;
and his conversation was as eagerly listened to&#xD;
by the gay crowd around him as by unsophisti-&#xD;
cated me. Hopeless of drawing me from the&#xD;
shy reserve in which I had involunta-ily clothed&#xD;
myself, one by one the strangers who had been&#xD;
introduced to me wandered away, and to my&#xD;
great relief I was allowed to sit by Miss Jenny's&#xD;
side unnoticed and untalked to. I was not al-&#xD;
lowed to feel myself neglected though, at any&#xD;
time, for when the company generally consented&#xD;
to worry me no more with civilities that only&#xD;
frightened me, and I was left sitting in my&#xD;
quiet insignificance, listening to the gay chatter&#xD;
around me, and watching all that occurred with&#xD;
eager, happy eyes, I not infrequently caught&#xD;
Mr. Harrington's glance directed toward me,&#xD;
anti often, during the evening, he would leave&#xD;
the gay circle of which he seemed to be the cen-&#xD;
tre, and would come to where I sat so quietly&#xD;
by his sister's side, questioning me kindly con-&#xD;
cerning my comfort and enjoyment.&#xD;
At last the music which I had been promised&#xD;
was introduced. The performers were several&#xD;
ladies who played upon the piano, and a gentle-&#xD;
man, proficient upon the violin; and then after&#xD;
a general cry for Eddie Harrington, that young&#xD;
gentleman appeared with mu flute in his hand&#xD;
celon wich he 1 certainly " discoursed most ex-&#xD;

nearly dark.                              an hour or so later without any inconvenience,&#xD;
&#xD;
Then we commenced the tiresome task of&#xD;
folding up and putting away the innumerable&#xD;
articles which had been hauled down from their&#xD;
shelves and boxes, to gratify the whims and&#xD;
fancies of the public.  An endless task it ap-&#xD;
peared to me, tired as I already was, and I looked&#xD;
almost despairingly upon the piles of shawls of&#xD;
every size and material which were lying n-&#xD;
folded and disordered upon the counter before&#xD;
me. Before we had fairly commenced our task&#xD;
the girls at the other counters had finished their&#xD;
work and were preparing to leave.&#xD;
I had noticed that my assistant, a girl of six-&#xD;
teen or seventeen, who had been with us only a&#xD;
few days, had seemed very uneasy during the last&#xD;
hour or so, and now, just while we were in the&#xD;
heaviest of the work, she was called away from&#xD;
her duties by the appearance of a little boy who&#xD;
ane to the door of the shawl-room and called&#xD;
her by name. They talked together very ear-&#xD;
nestly for a while, and she seemed so much dis-&#xD;
tressed at what he was saying that I could not&#xD;
avoid asking her what it was that troubled her.&#xD;
"l 'm sure I don't know what I ought to do,&#xD;
Miss Manvers," she said, bursting into tears.&#xD;
a Mother is very sick, and there has been no one&#xD;
at home with her all the afternoon but Sammy&#xD;
Here. I wanted to get home earlict to-day than&#xD;
usual on that account, but I knew I could not&#xD;
leave you here alone, so I said nothing about it.&#xD;
liut about lanhour ago, Sammy tells me, mother&#xD;
was taken worse, and he was so. frightened that&#xD;
he called in one of our neighbors to 'tay with&#xD;
ier while he came for me ; and I must go home,&#xD;
Miss Manvers, right away."&#xD;
''Of course you must," said I. "I am sorry&#xD;
all this trouble has happened the same day, but&#xD;
it can not be helped. 1 will do the best I can&#xD;
alone, and do you hurry home as fast as possible&#xD;
to your mother."&#xD;
Site started to. obey me, evidently much re-&#xD;
lieved, but paused again in dismay as she looked&#xD;
upon the confusion reigning around hter. ".But&#xD;
von, Miss Manvers, what will you do?   You&#xD;
surely can not finish all this work by yourself?&#xD;
Is it not possible to leave it?  I will be back&#xD;
as soon as the store is opened in the morning,&#xD;
if mother is so that I can leave her, and we can&#xD;
get put to rights then before the customers com-&#xD;
merrce coming in."&#xD;
Ol, no !" said I, " that will never do. 'The&#xD;
governor' is away to-night, you know, and Mr.&#xD;
Frank Nettleby will go the rounds of the store.&#xD;
I would not upon any account have him find&#xD;
outr department in sucht a condition. Do not&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
and if you will let your little brother carry a&#xD;
note to my sister on his way home, I shall not&#xD;
mind staying at all."&#xD;
So I scribbled a few lines to Agnes, telling&#xD;
her the cause of my detention, and bidding her&#xD;
not to be uneasy if I should not be home until&#xD;
quite late; and then I hurried the frightened&#xD;
uneasy creature off.  She had scarcely reached&#xD;
the door erc she cane hurrying back.&#xD;
"Oh! my goodness, Miss Manvers, I had&#xD;
completely forgotten ! Here is an order for a&#xD;
white crepe shawl just like the one Mrs. Mc-&#xD;
Donough bought yesterday. Her sister order-&#xD;
ed it, and said it must be sent home to-night,&#xD;
because she was going to leave the city early&#xD;
to-morrow morning. I was busy waiting on&#xD;
some other persons when the order was given&#xD;
to me, and thinking there was no particular&#xD;
hurry about it, I put it in my pocket and&#xD;
had completely forgotten it until this minute.&#xD;
What would Mr. Nettleby say if he knew of my&#xD;
negligence?  I have been in so much trouble&#xD;
about mother that it has made me quite inca-&#xD;
pable of attending to my duties here."&#xD;
"There is no harm done, thus far," I said&#xD;
good-humoredly, for she looked very much&#xD;
frightened, and I was anxious to soothe her.&#xD;
"It is not yet too late, so I will attend to send-&#xD;
ing it, and Mr. Nettleby need know nothing&#xD;
about itL"  So she hurried away quite satisfied,&#xD;
and I turned to find the desired article, and have&#xD;
it sent before the stores losed.&#xD;
Of course when one is in a hurry every thing&#xD;
happens to cause detention. Upon going to&#xD;
look for a shawl of the kind required, I found&#xD;
that there were none upon the shelves, and that&#xD;
it would be necessary for me- to repair to the&#xD;
wareroom in an upper story to obtain one. I&#xD;
was provoked enough, but there was no help for&#xD;
it, so I ran through the almost deserted store,&#xD;
and ascending the stairs to the fourth story, I&#xD;
entered the room in which the supply of shawls&#xD;
was stored.&#xD;
To my surprise the room had already an oc-&#xD;
cupant, in the form of no less a person than&#xD;
Mr. Frank Nettleby, who was unpacking a box&#xD;
of fine laces which had been brought up there&#xD;
that afternoon. I was glad he was there, for&#xD;
the shawls were troublesome to get at, and I&#xD;
knew he would not mind helping me.&#xD;
"Hallo !" he exclaimed, turning his head&#xD;
as I entered, apparently yet more astonished&#xD;
at seeing me than I had been at seeing him.&#xD;
" What brings you up here, Miss-Mies--'&#xD;
"Manvers," I suggested.&#xD;

&#xD;
memory is very treacherous. I thought you&#xD;
girls had all gone home. Did you wish to see&#xD;
me? is there any thing I can do for you ?"&#xD;
I explained the object of my visit, and he im-&#xD;
mediately arose and assisted me in obtaining&#xD;
the desired articles. I turned to go then, but&#xD;
he called me to come and look at the goods he&#xD;
was unpacking.&#xD;
"You women always like to look at pretty&#xD;
things," he said, "and here is some finery, the&#xD;
very sight of which will make you die of en-&#xD;
vy.",&#xD;
"Hardly charitable to show it to me, then,&#xD;
Mr. Nettleby," said I, laughing, but I tarried&#xD;
nevertheless, in spite of my hurry, for I was&#xD;
neither more nor less than woman, and possess-&#xD;
ed as great a fondness for pretty things as Mr.&#xD;
Frank had credited me with.&#xD;
"It is part of the wedding paraphernalia of&#xD;
Judge Home's daughter," Mr. Nettleby went on&#xD;
to say. "I received the commission to get&#xD;
them when I was in Paris, and I ordered them&#xD;
at head-quarters. I tried my hand at a little&#xD;
designing for some of the lace patterns myself,&#xD;
and I am rather anxious to have a lady's opin-&#xD;
ion of them before they are submitted to Miss&#xD;
Home's inspection."&#xD;
lHe shook open cloud after cloud of soft fleecy&#xD;
lace, and thin gauzy muslin, veils, sleeves, col-&#xD;
lars, handkerchiefs, embroideries of all kinds,&#xD;
each article more beautiful than its predecessor.&#xD;
I had just taken from his hand a lovely cobweb&#xD;
which he called a handkerchief, proclaiming&#xD;
himself designer of the pattern which embellish-&#xD;
ed it, when a man's foot approached the closed&#xD;
door of the apartment which we were occupy-&#xD;
ing. Just then there was a great noise raised&#xD;
in the room below us, caused by the drawing&#xD;
of some heavy crates across the floor, and when&#xD;
that noise had subsided, the sound of retreating&#xD;
footsteps was heard in the distance descending&#xD;
the stairs, and Mr. Nettleby remarked careless-&#xD;
ly, in answer to my inquiring look, -" One of&#xD;
the porters, I suppose, sent up stairs for some-&#xD;
thing he had forgotten. They are getting in a&#xD;
lot of domestics and such like heavy goods down&#xD;
below there, which is the cause of that confound-&#xD;
ed clatter. I guess they are through now.&#xD;
Come, look at that handkerchief, and tell me&#xD;
honestly how you like it."&#xD;
"It is pretty, very pretty ; but I think there&#xD;
are some of the others I liked better: this one,&#xD;
for instance, with the thistle and lily border ;&#xD;
but they are all beautiful. Did they cost much ?"&#xD;
" What a truly feminine question !" laughed&#xD;
Mr. Frank. " I suppose you will value them&#xD;

judge expends on them. Well, for your satis-&#xD;
faction be it known then, that the thistle and&#xD;
lily border was the most expensive one of the&#xD;
lot, though any one of them cost more than you&#xD;
can earn in a year. Stop ! don't go yet ! you&#xD;
have not seen the gem of the collection, the&#xD;
wedding-dress ;" and hurried as I was, I could&#xD;
not resist the temptation, but sat lingering on,&#xD;
quite breathless with delight, as he opened a&#xD;
box that was in itself a gem of art, and from the&#xD;
folds of silver paper which enshrouded it, drew&#xD;
forth into the light of day a fabric so exquisite&#xD;
that even my inexperienced eyes knew it to be&#xD;
worth a fortune.&#xD;
"None of my handiwork there," he said,&#xD;
opening the robe and throwing it over my black&#xD;
dress that the pattern might be fully displayed.&#xD;
" One of the first artists of the day was called&#xD;
upon to furnish that design, and I guess he&#xD;
found it a better paying job than many of his&#xD;
more dignified studies. Look at those clusters&#xD;
in each corner ! 'T'hey are what I call superb."&#xD;
And having admired the beautiful cobweb until&#xD;
I had expended upon it all the adjectives in&#xD;
my vocabulary, I rose again to depart.&#xD;
I must-go, Mr. Nettleby," I said ; ''I shall&#xD;
not get through my work down stairs until ten&#xD;
o'clock if I linger here any longer;" and I hur-&#xD;
ried to the door, quite worried to see how late it&#xD;
was growing.&#xD;
"I have rather more of a task here myself&#xD;
than I had bargained for," lie-said, as he com-&#xD;
menced refolding the dress. " I shall have my&#xD;
hands full in getting these ' airy nothings' back&#xD;
to the shape I found them."&#xD;
Meanwhile I had been trying to open the&#xD;
door, but found that it resisted my efforts, from&#xD;
some cause or other. "You will have to cone&#xD;
and open this door for me, I believe, Mr. Nettle-&#xD;
by," I said at last; '' something seems to be the&#xD;
matter with it."&#xD;
lie tarried a moment to deposit out of harm's&#xD;
way the laces he had been holding, and then&#xD;
hastened to comply with my request. lie gave&#xD;
the door a forcible jerk, but an ineffectual one,&#xD;
then he -shook it with all his strength ; all in&#xD;
vain ; the handle turned readily, but the door&#xD;
would not open.&#xD;
''Upon my soul !" he cried in dismay, " I&#xD;
believe we are locked in. Could that fellow&#xD;
who disturbed us awhile since have been the&#xD;
watchman of the night? If it was, he has pass-&#xD;
ed the room, and thinking it empty, has locked&#xD;
it for the night, as it was his duty to do, the&#xD;
careless scoundrel !" with which rather contra-&#xD;
dictory conclusion, Mr. Nettleby rattled at the&#xD;

&#xD;
door with all his might, and exerted his lungs&#xD;
to the utmost in calling for help.&#xD;
In vain ; I knew, and lie knew too, that if&#xD;
the men from the story beneath us had depart-&#xD;
ed, and the night-watchman had gone his&#xD;
rounds, there was not a human being in the&#xD;
building, for the latter, although lie remained in&#xD;
the building all night, went home to his supper&#xD;
first, and did not return until late in the even-&#xD;
ing. Even had lie still been in the store, how-&#xD;
ever, he was completely out of hearing of the&#xD;
combined voices of half a dozen men exerted in&#xD;
the fourth story.&#xD;
Mr. Nettleby, seeing that it was quite impos-&#xD;
sible that lie should make himself heard at the&#xD;
door, next turned his attention to the windows,&#xD;
and flinging one open, again shouted as loud as&#xD;
he was able, in hopes of attracting the attention&#xD;
of some one below. Alas ! this hope was no&#xD;
less vain than the other. The room was in the&#xD;
back of the building, and the windows opened&#xD;
only on a deserted yard and tightly-barred back&#xD;
buildings belonging to our own and adjoining&#xD;
stores. Not a human being evidently was with-&#xD;
in sight or hearing, and at last, relinquishing&#xD;
his hopeless task, and hoarse from the exertions&#xD;
lie had made, Mr. Nettleby turned to me as I&#xD;
sat pallid with apprehension upon one of the&#xD;
boxes that filled the room.;&#xD;
"Well, ma'am, I am afraid we shall have to&#xD;
snake up our minds to pass the night here," lie&#xD;
said, adding, with a forced laugh, "I atm sure:&#xD;
if you can endure my society for that length of&#xD;
time, I ought not to be discontented with&#xD;
yours."  And then the dreadful predicament ini&#xD;
which I was placed I could no longer refrain&#xD;
from realizing.&#xD;
I started to my feet, sick and faint. I turned&#xD;
so white that I suppiose lie thought I was about&#xD;
to faint, for lie sprang quickly to my side as ift&#xD;
to support me. '' My God ! what will become&#xD;
of me !" I cried ; then clinging to his arm, r&#xD;
I gazed into his face with agonized, implor. -&#xD;
ing eyes.  " Oh, Mr. Nettlehy ! do something !s&#xD;
please do something ! don't stop trying to make&#xD;
them hear you ! Think, think, what a dreadful&#xD;
thing this will be for me !&#xD;
le passed his arm around me, for I wasa&#xD;
trembling so that I could hardly stand, and at&#xD;
the time I was quite unconscious of his action; e&#xD;
lie looked down into my pallid face with a kind, f&#xD;
grave glance that would have reassured me if t&#xD;
any thing could, and seating me gently upon a&#xD;
the box again, he spoke to me in a quiet, sooth- n&#xD;
ing tone.                                 11&#xD;
"You are glaring yourself unnecessarily ;&#xD;
have confidence in mie; I will allow no shadow a&#xD;
&#xD;
of blame to fall upon you from tl e unfortunate&#xD;
conjuncture of circumstances thai has forced us&#xD;
into this unpleasant predicament. That you&#xD;
will perhaps be obliged to pass a very uncom-&#xD;
fortable, wearisome night I am afraid I can not&#xD;
deny, but rest assured that I will permit no far-&#xD;
ther annoyance to result from it.&#xD;
"You could not help it,"I mur ured almost&#xD;
inarticulately.  " There is not an emplovd&#xD;
about the establishment that will not know of&#xD;
this affair to-morrow, and oh ! the cruel, terri-&#xD;
ble things they will say of me !" i nd I wrung&#xD;
my hands in agony.&#xD;
Mr. Nettleby's kind face wore a terner frown&#xD;
than I had thought it could possibly have as-&#xD;
sumed. "If there is one of them, man, wom-&#xD;
an, or child, who dares by word or insinuation&#xD;
to cast a slur upon my honor or your delicacy,&#xD;
he or she shall leave my employ that moment.&#xD;
Fear not; my thoughtlessness has involved you&#xD;
in this difficulty, and I promise you most sol-&#xD;
emnly that no endeavor upon my part shall be&#xD;
lacking to screen you from its ill eft cts. Rely&#xD;
upon me."&#xD;
I felt his kindness, and I knew that all he&#xD;
promised he would perform, but he could not&#xD;
soothe the agony that was battling with my&#xD;
heart. He could not even understan it. How&#xD;
should he?  How could he dream thtt the poor,&#xD;
commonplace shop-girl who heretofore had re-&#xD;
ceived from him so little attention th t her very&#xD;
name had been forgotten, the obscure, friend-&#xD;
less woman, dependent upon her daily toil for&#xD;
her daily bread ; how could he dream that so&#xD;
insignificant a creature should prize above all&#xD;
worldly advantages and station, nay,  ven above&#xD;
life itself, the stainless purity of a name more&#xD;
honorable than his own ! How could he im-&#xD;
agine the cruel torture I endured w en forced&#xD;
to the belief that the name my fathr had so&#xD;
gloriously maintained unsullied, should now, by&#xD;
my most sorrowful misfortune, become the&#xD;
theme of thoughtless jests, perhaps of malicious&#xD;
scandal ! And with look and voice of agony I&#xD;
could only reiterate my cry, "Do try again to&#xD;
make them hear you, Mr. Nettleby ! Do not&#xD;
ease your efforts, I implore you, while there is&#xD;
a shadow of a chance to escape !"&#xD;
So, obedient to my  entreaties, again he call-&#xD;
d from the window and rattled at the door, and&#xD;
inally, with an empty goods-box thumped upon&#xD;
lhe floor, making din enough, I thought, to have&#xD;
roused the, whole neighborhood. All n vain;&#xD;
io sound responsive to his own broke the si-&#xD;
ence when his futP a labors ceased-.&#xD;
" You see," he said, "it is all useless. I do&#xD;
ot suppose there is a soul in the building ex-&#xD;
&#xD;
cept ourselves. It is abominable, this being&#xD;
shut up like a rat in a trap ! A prisoner in&#xD;
one's own house ! If I had but a crow-bar !"'&#xD;
and he gazed helplessly around; "but no !&#xD;
deuce a bit of steel is there within these four&#xD;
walls stronger than my pen-knife. There is no&#xD;
help for it, Miss Manvers. Let us make the&#xD;
best of a very disagreeable business: endure&#xD;
the night as best we may ; and believe me, in&#xD;
the course of a few days we shall come to look&#xD;
upon our adventure actually in the light of a&#xD;
good joke."&#xD;
A glance at my white, despairing face check-&#xD;
ed his light speech ; he came and stood by my&#xD;
side, looking down pityingly upon me. "Do&#xD;
you really then anticipate so much trouble from&#xD;
this foolish affair ?" he said gently.&#xD;
The kind words and pitying tone vanquished&#xD;
completely the little fortitude I yet had man-&#xD;
aged to preserve. Bowing my head upon my&#xD;
hands, my long-repressed agony found relief in&#xD;
convulsive sobs and tears.  "God pity me," I&#xD;
cried ; "how shall I ever bear it ! Oh, my fa-&#xD;
ther ! my father ! little did I ever think that&#xD;
the day would come when I should be thankful&#xD;
you were in your grave !"&#xD;
"Hush, my dear girl, do not weep so, I beg&#xD;
of you !" he said, scarcely less agitated than my-&#xD;
seltf "Surely your imagination is inflicting&#xD;
upon you needless suffering. Your fears are&#xD;
exaggerating the evils you apprehend."&#xD;
"I can not exaggerate them," I said, almost&#xD;
fiercely. "There can be no worse, save actual&#xD;
crime, than the evil that has befallen me. You&#xD;
are a gentleman in position and breeding, and,]&#xD;
doubt not, value highly the honor of you&#xD;
name ; if you were poor, helpless, friendless as i&#xD;
am, with that good nmem your only treasure, in&#xD;
beholding it imperiled you could perhaps appre&#xD;
ciate my feelings now. Yet, no ! you'could no&#xD;
even then, for you are a man, and in no circum&#xD;
stances could you realize the horrible misfor&#xD;
tune that a sullied reputation is to a woman.&#xD;
am no coward, but I could meet the assassin'&#xD;
knife with far more fortitude than I can th&#xD;
jeers and inuendoes of those girls below, to&#xD;
morrow morning."&#xD;
" Is it'indeed so ?" he said sorrowfully; an&#xD;
then he turned away from me and paced up an&#xD;
down the room in thoughtful silence, while&#xD;
the violence of my grief exhausted, sat wit&#xD;
bowed head in the passive quiet of despii&#xD;
Presently he stopped in his walk, and agai&#xD;
came and stood by my side. With gentle vh&#xD;
leuce be removed my hands from my face, ar&#xD;
retaining them in his clasp, lie said softl&#xD;
" Miss Manvers, look at me !"&#xD;
&#xD;
Mechanically I obeyed, and raised my eyes,&#xD;
dull and glazed with suffering, to his face. IIe&#xD;
lool-ed very much agitated, and there were ac-&#xD;
tualy tears in the bright blue eyes that gazed&#xD;
pityingly into my own. He looked at me with&#xD;
peculiar fixedness ere he spoke, and when he&#xD;
did, his words at first seemed more in answer to&#xD;
his own thoughts than intended as an address&#xD;
to me.  "You are a good, virtuous girl, I do&#xD;
believe, and one whom any moan might learn to&#xD;
love; your manner and speech show that your&#xD;
education and breeding have been superior to&#xD;
the circumstances in which 1 find you." lie&#xD;
paused a moment, and continued gazing into&#xD;
my face with an eager, searching look that&#xD;
seemed as if it defied deceit-then with more&#xD;
decision, lie continued, "The same vile slander-&#xD;
ers, whose malicious misconstructions would&#xD;
sully your wiomanily fame, would, at the same&#xD;
time, asperse my honor as a gentleman. I may&#xD;
be able to save you from unjust suspicion in the&#xD;
store, but outside of it my power faiils, anid all&#xD;
I can do is to suffer with you. I see but one&#xD;
mode of escape for you. Our misfortune is mu-&#xD;
tual, let us meet it together. My heart and&#xD;
hand are free ; I offer theta to you now in all&#xD;
sincerity; and in making you my wife, I can&#xD;
safely promise to shield you front all the scan-&#xD;
dal you so much dread, and to raise you at&#xD;
once to a position so far above the power of the&#xD;
malicious, that you may safely venture to defy&#xD;
t them."&#xD;
lie paused again, but I could not speak ; my&#xD;
tongue was palsied with surprise and consterna-&#xD;
I tion at his unexpected words. Ie waited a&#xD;
r moment or so, and then gently repeated, "Have&#xD;
I I not made myself sufficiently plain?  I ask&#xD;
you to become my wife, Miss Manvers ; may I&#xD;
not hope for a favorable answer ?"&#xD;
t   At last I cried, "You are an honorable and&#xD;
- a generous man, Mr. Nettleby ; a true and loyal&#xD;
- gentleman ; and miserable though I am, I can&#xD;
I understand and appreciate the magnanimity of&#xD;
s your conduct, though God forbid that I should&#xD;
e take advantage of it! You are in no way re-&#xD;
- sponsible for the misfortune which has befallen&#xD;
me, and I am not so selfish as to wish to save&#xD;
d myself by dragging you into an alliance with a&#xD;
d woman whose worldly station is so far below&#xD;
I, your own, and in whom, save from compassion,&#xD;
h your feelings are in no way interested."&#xD;
r.   ''I am not - so sure of that,"~he said, in a&#xD;
[n low tone, and then in his natural voice he rc-&#xD;
o- sumed, " 1 will_ not agitate you farther, by&#xD;
id dwelling upon this subject; think over what I&#xD;

mood.   That I sincerely hope your reply may&#xD;
be in the affirmative, let this attest ;" and bend-&#xD;
ing over, he pressed his lips upon my hand with&#xD;
a fervor that left me in no doubt of the sincerity&#xD;
of his speech.  Then he left me, and walked&#xD;
away to the window, where, in the gathering&#xD;
darkness, I could just distinguish the outlines&#xD;
of his form as lie leaned against the casement.&#xD;
Meanwhile I sat, stunned almost into apathy&#xD;
by the sudden and violent emotions which had&#xD;
racked my frame during the past hour. I did&#xD;
not think of the morrow, for my mind was be-&#xD;
coming too unsettled to appreciate its terrors. I&#xD;
(lid not think of the offer with which Mr. Net-&#xD;
tlehy had honored me, nor did i think of him at&#xD;
all ; a vague confused idea that his position&#xD;
toward me had vastly altered, indeed struggled&#xD;
within my mind ; vet any active sentiment either&#xD;
of like or dislike toward him, I felt none. I (lid&#xD;
not think of the discomforts which were likely to&#xD;
fall to my lot during the long, long, tedious&#xD;
night now rapidly coming on ; I sat with folded&#xD;
hands, my head leaning back upon a rough box&#xD;
that stood behind me, a dull, heavy feeling of&#xD;
distress weighing upon my heart and brain ;&#xD;
with but cue thought, one idea, at all clearly de-&#xD;
fined amid the host of shadows that beset me,&#xD;
and that was, '' What would ' the governor' say,&#xD;
when he heard what had happened ?"&#xD;
I d1o not know how long I sat thus ; the time&#xD;
seed interminable to me. Twice Mr. Net-&#xD;
tleby camne to me from his station by the win-&#xD;
low ; once lie brought a couple of heavy shawls&#xD;
he had taken from one of the boxes, and throw-&#xD;
ig one over the box behind me, to serve as a&#xD;
sort of pdllow for my head, lie wrapped the other&#xD;
around my shoulders, and then silently with-&#xD;
drew again. A little later, a heavy sigh, which&#xD;
escaped from me almost unconsciously, as I&#xD;
slightly changed my position, brought him to&#xD;
m side again. iHe stood beside me in the&#xD;
darkness, iiiotionless and silent fbi a moment ; at&#xD;
last bending over me so that I felt his breath&#xD;
upon my forehead, he said gently, '' I hoped you&#xD;
were sleeping ;are you comfortable ?  Can I&#xD;
do any thing more for you ?"&#xD;
" Nothing, I thank you."&#xD;
Still he lingered, and I could distinctly hear&#xD;
his iick breathing as lie stood over me. A&#xD;
vague feeling of terror crept over me, as I re-&#xD;
membered how completely I was in this man's&#xD;
power ; my womanly aelicacy took the alarm,&#xD;
and I shrank back from him, faint and trembling,&#xD;
as far as I was able. He seemed instinctively&#xD;
to comprehend my feeling ; lie sighed heavily,&#xD;
sand passed his hand caressingly over niy head&#xD;
as if tO reassure me, and then lie stole from nmy&#xD;
&#xD;
side again to some distant part o the room;&#xD;
where, I could scarcely tell.&#xD;
Again a long, unbroken silence, interrupted&#xD;
only by a restless motion occasionally from him.&#xD;
Sleep came not near my eyes, and I knew that&#xD;
Mr. Nettleby was quite as wakeful as I. At&#xD;
last there came a sound ; I could not credit my&#xD;
ears ; I leaned forward, and listened breathless.&#xD;
ly; it came nearer ; I was not deceived.  "Mr.&#xD;
Nettleby !" I cried. "Quick! call for help;&#xD;
there's a man's foot upon the stairs."&#xD;
Ie needed no second bidding, for my fellow-&#xD;
prisoner had caught the sound as well as I.&#xD;
lIe sprang to the door, and pounded lustily upon&#xD;
it, shouting vigorously at the same time.&#xD;
"Where are you?     Who calls for help ?"&#xD;
said a voice outside.&#xD;
"It is I--Frank- Nettleby. We have been&#xD;
locked in this room, through mistake, by that&#xD;
infernal watchman.  The keys are kept in the&#xD;
chest at the end of the passage; for Heaven's&#xD;
sake get them, and let us out."&#xD;
The step retreated as directed, but presently&#xD;
returned ; then came the welcome sound of the&#xD;
key rattling in the lock, the door was thrown&#xD;
open, aid the light of a lantern streamed into&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
" Caroline, are you here ?" cried a familiar&#xD;
voice. With a wild cry I sprang forward ; a&#xD;
strong arm was thrown around me, and the next&#xD;
iuonient I was sobbing upon the bosom of Mr.&#xD;
Harrington.&#xD;
He clasped me in a close embrace, and I felt&#xD;
his heart beat heavily beneath my head, yet he&#xD;
asked me no questions, and indeed I could have&#xD;
answered none then had my life depended on it.&#xD;
But Mr. Nettleby's tongue ran fast enough.&#xD;
" Curse that watchman !" he was saying;&#xD;
"he has got us into a pretty predicament;&#xD;
turned the key on us while we were looking at&#xD;
Miss home's wedding finery, and was out of&#xD;

pened. I have shouted myself hoarse, and Miss&#xD;
Manvers has almost cried her eyes out but all&#xD;
to no purpose.  I supposed we were infor the&#xD;
night, of course. What lucky star sent you&#xD;
here, Harrington, just in the nick of time ?"&#xD;
"No idea of finding you, Mr. Nettle)y, I as-&#xD;
sure you.  My sister sent me with a message to&#xD;
Miss Manvers, this evening, and when I arrived&#xD;
at her house, I found her little sister becoming&#xD;
very uneasy about her lengthened absence,&#xD;
though a note that she had received told her&#xD;
that Caroline would be detained at thy store&#xD;
later than usual. I thought it very impi'robable&#xD;
flint she should still he here, hut I concluded I&#xD;
hind better come and ascertaini for Inyself.&#xD;

Mr. Nettleby looked very angry ; agitated as and walked rapidly down the street.&#xD;
I was, I could see that.  "Come along, then !"  The caresses of those two men yet lingered&#xD;

There was no help for it I saw ; so seizing my&#xD;

imaginable solemnity he commenced his own&#xD;
labors, and thr ughout the whole day was I thus&#xD;
honored, my gcrntleman keeping his seat undis-&#xD;
trrbedly, though at times the little enclosure&#xD;
was thronged with customers, and became a per-&#xD;
feet Babel of noise and confusion, and at all&#xD;
hours it was dark and close, and very incon-&#xD;
'      venient for clerkly labors. Sometimes he work-&#xD;
ed quite industriously, with a few rapid calcula-&#xD;
tions arriving at conclusions over which I&#xD;
should have puzzled for hours; but by far the&#xD;
greater part of the time he sat leaning back in&#xD;
his chair stroking his long heard, and watching&#xD;
me so attentively with his keen blue eyes, that I&#xD;
-grew so nervous I could hardly write.  Then,&#xD;
noticing my disturbance, he would relieve me&#xD;
temporarily, by bandying lively repartee with&#xD;
Miss Harrington, whom he took a mischievous&#xD;
delight in teasing.  She watched the whole per-&#xD;
formance very suspiciously, and evidently was&#xD;
completely- at a loss to know what interpretation&#xD;
&#xD;
partrnent he assumed himself, and with his rapid&#xD;
business-like habits was able, with an hour's ap-&#xD;
plication, to accomplish what had formerly oc-&#xD;
cupied me three times as long. The rest of the&#xD;
time he occupied chiefly in staring at me, and&#xD;
in sketching caricatures of the customers on&#xD;
scraps of paper, which, as soon as finished, he&#xD;
would toss over to me for my edification ; and&#xD;
comical enough they were, too ; much as lie an-&#xD;
noyed me, I was amused in spite of myself, for&#xD;
his sketches were full of genius, and all that he&#xD;
said- was so witty and original, that I listened&#xD;
and laughed, notwithstanding my vexation.&#xD;
Miss Jenny often scolded at being deprived so&#xD;
entirely of my services, and I could see that she&#xD;
was much annoyed by the odd turn which if-&#xD;
fairs had taken, but he never would release me,&#xD;
no matter how hurried she was. i " If you want&#xD;
another clerk,"he would say, " I'll engage one&#xD;
for you, though I really do not think you will&#xD;

looking over my shoulder at the paper upon tion, and the perfect gravity of the gentleman&#xD;
which I hac been employed, "transcribing cast such a business-like appearance over the&#xD;

no alternative but to obey; and before I was to be obeyed, and waited to see me start for&#xD;

there ; but my transcript I must have, and I&#xD;
must have it in Miss Manvers's handwriting.&#xD;
You have no idea, Miss Jenny, of the value I&#xD;
place upon that copy she is making." And all&#xD;
this lie said with the gravest air imaginable, so&#xD;
serious that even sharp-sighted Miss Jenny was&#xD;
partially blinded, and in view of his solemnity&#xD;
and my undisguisable discontent, dared raise no&#xD;
farther objections.&#xD;
Oh ! how lie vexed me ! At times, when&#xD;
he bent over me to point out some trifling error&#xD;
in my manuscript, or to suggest soie improve-&#xD;
ment which lie would argue about as gravely as&#xD;
if he were really interested in the useless thing;&#xD;
when he would question me in such a way that&#xD;
in replying I was obliged to lift my eyes to his;&#xD;
or when, to point out some word or letter refer-&#xD;
red to, he would touch my hand to guide the&#xD;
pen1 to the place designated ; at such times I&#xD;
felt provoked enough to have thrown the book&#xD;
at liimii, and to have boxed his ears into the bar-&#xD;
gait; for I knew, as well as if he had told me,&#xD;
that the whole affair had been gotten up by him&#xD;
for no earthly motive but to enable him to lin-&#xD;
ger unsuspected in my society, and that, save to&#xD;
carry on what I supposed lie considered an in-&#xD;
teresting flirtation, he placed no more value&#xD;
upon that abominable book of bills than I did&#xD;
myself. Not only was the whole affair an an-&#xD;
noyance to me in itself, but it began to attract&#xD;
the attention of the employs in the store, and&#xD;
I found myself very frequently the subject of&#xD;
witticisms more poilited than delicate. These,&#xD;
however, strong in my consciousness of indiffer-&#xD;
ence, I could have laughed at, and perhaps disre-&#xD;
garded, but I found that my employer's conde-&#xD;
scension wasbringingupon me a still heavier pun-&#xD;
ishment: "the governor" was noticeably grow-&#xD;
ing cold and reserved in his demeanor toward&#xD;
Inc ; though always quiet and undemonstrative,&#xD;
he had yet hitherto had the faculty of making&#xD;
me perceive that he cared for my comfort, and&#xD;
was interested in all that I said and did; in short,&#xD;
that lie was my friend. Now all was changed ;&#xD;
he never spoke to me save when compelled to&#xD;
by coninon civility ; though Miss Harrington&#xD;
had several times spent an evening with me&#xD;
during the few weeks of which I am writing,&#xD;
her younger brother had ever been her escort ;&#xD;
mnd upon two occasions when I visited her, "the&#xD;
governor" was called down town by unavoidable&#xD;
business, and Master Edwin had been obliged&#xD;
to gallant me home in his brother's stead. For&#xD;
two weeks lie had not once happened in upon&#xD;
us during his rounds, as it wvas formerly his cus-&#xD;
tonm so frequently to do. Only once do I re-&#xD;

AND'S CRIME.&#xD;
Frank honored it with his daily presence ; it&#xD;
was one day about a week after my daily hum-&#xD;
bug of copying was instituted. Mr. Frank had&#xD;
been in an unusually merry mood that morning,&#xD;
and had exerted himself to the hitmost to dis-&#xD;
pel the gravity which I always endeavored to&#xD;
maintain in his society ; he had jest handed me&#xD;
a most extravagant caricature of a stout coun-&#xD;
try-woman to whom Miss Harrington was try.&#xD;
big to sell a velvet cloak ; the outr i figure in&#xD;
her cotton delaine dress, gloveless hands, and&#xD;
coarse straw bonnet, decked out in the costly&#xD;
garment which had evidently mace a great im-&#xD;
pression upon her, and striving frahitically to ob-&#xD;
tain a view of her own back in the tall mirror&#xD;
before which she was posturing, was laughable&#xD;
enough in itself, but when depicted by Mr.&#xD;
Frank's clever pencil, its salient points exagger-&#xD;
ated, so like, yet so unlike, I should have been&#xD;
more than mortal could I have repressed my&#xD;
mirth while viewing it ; and yet I was so&#xD;
ashamed of my weakness, so fearful that Miss&#xD;
Ilarrington would see mue. One glance at my&#xD;
companion's face, and I was almost undone ;&#xD;
the curves and dimples around the handsome&#xD;
mouth, the blue eyes absolutely dancing with&#xD;
merriment ; 1 covered my eyes with my, hand&#xD;
and leaned upon the table before fue, my face&#xD;
scarlet with the effort to refrain frm laughing.&#xD;
Just then "the governor's" voi e sounded by&#xD;
my side, quick and angry. "Miss ;lIanvers, was&#xD;
this bill made out by you ?"&#xD;
I looked up, and all disposition to laugh fled&#xD;
from ise as Imet the glance of those stern grey&#xD;
eyes. Trembling and alarmed, I took the pa-&#xD;
per lie handed to me. " I copied it, sir," I said,&#xD;
hi umbly enough, "but Mr. Frank pade out the&#xD;
bill."&#xD;
"Mr. Frank, then, will doubtless not cons-&#xD;
plain, when I tell him there is an error in it of&#xD;
fifty dollars from uncharged goods, which it is&#xD;
too late now to rectify, as the good themselves&#xD;
and a receipted duplicate of this bill have been&#xD;
forwarded to their destination."&#xD;
Mr.~Frank made a comical grimace, and&#xD;
shrugged his shoulders. "Don't look so sav-&#xD;
age, Harrington, and don't let our pe rtner know,&#xD;
and I guess I can survive the daniage. Charge&#xD;
the loss to my account, and I'll bear it like a mar-&#xD;
tyr. But just let mc tell you, Ma mselle Car-&#xD;
oline, the next time you make me laugh when&#xD;
I am writing out bills, I shall divide the conse-&#xD;
quences of the errors between us--charge the&#xD;
losses to your account and the profits to my&#xD;
own."    .&#xD;
But I was in no humor to laugh now ; almost&#xD;
before the light speech was concluded, "the gov-&#xD;
&#xD;
F. N. AND "THE GOVERNOR."&#xD;
&#xD;
ernor" had disappeared, angry and displeased, I_&#xD;
knew, at what he must consider my levity and&#xD;
heedlessness ; and guiltless though I knew my-&#xD;
self to be, I was as wretched'as though I had&#xD;
deserved his wrath, when I felt that he must&#xD;
think me ungrateful and insolent, even if lie was&#xD;
charitable enough to deem me no worse.&#xD;
I was cross enough to Mr. Frank the next&#xD;
day, but my conduct seemed to have but little&#xD;
effect upon him ; and it. was quite powerless to&#xD;
rid me either of himself or his accounts. I saw&#xD;
nothing of "the governor" for a week afterward ;&#xD;
except at a distance, that is ; for of course lie&#xD;
was on duty in the ' store as usual ; but all&#xD;
the little friendly chats we had formerly had,&#xD;
seemed to be entirely a thing of the past. I&#xD;
had never been conscious of how much I had&#xD;
been thrown into his society, until now that I&#xD;
was so entirely deprived of it; and sadly enough&#xD;
I now remembered how often we had formerly&#xD;
&#xD;
39&#xD;
&#xD;
ashamed to acknowledge, and which she had&#xD;
sent for me to dissipate. "The governor" was sit-&#xD;
ting in Miss Jenny's room when I entered, andi&#xD;
looked vastly astonished, and, I thought, a little&#xD;
annoyed when he saw me ; evidently I had not&#xD;
been an expected guest to him. There was no&#xD;
need of his leaving the house this time to avoid&#xD;
me, for as his brother had brought me there, his&#xD;
brother of course would take me home again.&#xD;
So, after fidgeting (I really can express his he-&#xD;
havior by iio other word) around the room for&#xD;
a while, Mr. larringtoiinmurmured some almost&#xD;
inaudible excuses, and retreated to his own apart-&#xD;
meat. Eddie, too, soon after quitted the roon,&#xD;
and Miss Jenny and I were left to ourselves.&#xD;
The business part of the visit was soon trans&#xD;
acted, and the rest of the evening passed in quiet&#xD;
friendly chat, which I should have enjoyed very&#xD;
much had my mind been as undisturbed as usual&#xD;
At length ten o'clock came, and I rose to de-&#xD;
&#xD;
met and conversed, during the routine of our part.  When I was hooded and shawled, Miss&#xD;
daily duties.  Now it had been some errand Harrington stepped to the door which connect-&#xD;
from his sister to him which I was sent to ful- ecl her brother's apartment with her own, and&#xD;
fill ; then some trifling instruction which he had opening it, said, " John, you will have the pleas-&#xD;
chosen to give me about my accounts, which ure of escorting Caroline home to-night; Jim&#xD;
would bring him to my table in the shawl- Rivers is sick, and has sent for Eddie to stay all&#xD;
room. On arriving at the store in  the morning night with him."&#xD;
amid on leaving it at night, the first and last face  I heard a book dashed impatiently down, and&#xD;
I saw had been his, and he had never' allowed an angry ejaculation; then the door was closed,&#xD;
me to pass him without a few kind words, which and Miss Jenny returned to where I stood dis-&#xD;
often, when time permitted, were lengthened mayed at the prospect of forcing msy unwelcome&#xD;
into conversations.  These and many other in- company upon Mr. Ilarrington. " Oh! Miss&#xD;
stances recurred to me, now that they all had  Harrington," I cried, '"why did you not let me&#xD;
vanished, of the intercourse I had had with Mr. know a little earlier, and I could have gone by&#xD;
Harrington ; pleasant little episodes, enlighten- myself! I am sure I am disturbing ' the gov-&#xD;
ing my daily toil, making me ever leave my la- ernor."&#xD;
bors with regret, and return to them with pleas-  " Oh! no, my dear, not at aill;" and Miss&#xD;
ure.                                        Jenny's placid face looked as uneonscious of the&#xD;
Miss Jenny also noticed the change, for she white lie she was telling as if she had not known&#xD;
said grumblingly one day that "it seemed to her that I was perfectly aware of her breach of ve-&#xD;
John's business lately lay in any part of the racity ; no time for farther comment was per-&#xD;
store rather than the shawl department."    mitted, however, for the door opened, and Mr.&#xD;
One evening Eddie Harrington came to me Harrington, hat in hand, made his appearance.&#xD;
with a note from Miss Jenny, bidding me return  I bade adieu to Miss Jenny at the door of&#xD;
with her brother, as she had some special busi- her room, and then ran hastily down chie stair-&#xD;
ness to transact with me, which demanded my case, followed more deliberately by my escort.&#xD;
immediate presence, and pleading a headache I had to pause for him to throw open the door,&#xD;
as an excuse for not coming to me.  Of course but when I stepped out into the air, and found&#xD;
I went to her ; I had no alternative, though it to be a beautiful bright moonlight night, I no&#xD;
sensible as I was of the displeasure of "the gov- longer hesitated to say the words that had been&#xD;
ernor,'" I should much have preferred not to go. upon my lips ever since he had put on his hat.&#xD;
But I went ; found the business affair upon "Mr. Harrington, there is really no imeed of&#xD;

cued with a fit of the blues,' which she was steps, half frightened at my own temerity.&#xD;

40                            MY HUSBAND'S CRIME.&#xD;
Before I had gone half a dozen paces, how-.  As he gazed into mhy flushed face, and saw&#xD;
ever, he was by my side. Catching my hand, my tearful eyes and quivering lips, his face re-&#xD;
he drew my arm within his, still retaining his laxed from its stern intensity, and the old look&#xD;
hold of my hand.  " Are you cr zy ?" he cried of reassuring  kindness crept into it. I turned&#xD;
sharply, "or has your dislike fort me become so away my head to hide the fastifalling tears.&#xD;
strong that you can not endure my company, He clasped with a firmer pressure the hand that&#xD;
even during this fifteen minutes' walk ?"   was trembling in his.  '' My poor little girl&#xD;
This was a new view of the question to me, he said almost involuntarily. "I have been very&#xD;
and the query certainly staggered me a little, unkind, as well as very unjust to ybu. I fear."&#xD;
but I managed to answer meekly, ''I beg your  Something in the tone of his voice, and in&#xD;
pardon ; I thought you did not want to go."  the pressure of his hand, even more than the&#xD;
" Nonsense !" he said crossly ; and then we few words he had uttered, areas ured me so&#xD;
walked on fur a while in grim silence,      much that I ventured again to raise my eyes to&#xD;
With all my bravado I was feeling very mis- his face ; there was a gleam of something deep-&#xD;
erable ; the remembrance of that beautiful past er and tenderer than kindness in the eyes that&#xD;
in which " the governor" had been to me all met my own, that caused my heart to beat tHi-&#xD;
that was kind and considerate, honored and be- mnltuously, and my cheeks to color hotly be-&#xD;
loved by me beyond all created beings, haunted neath his glance. "What did I do? why were&#xD;
me like the ghost of a dead friend ; I could not you angry ?" again I ventured to ash.&#xD;
realize the change that two short weeks had   "You have done nothing that I have any&#xD;
wrought in the pleasant relations which had ex- right to reproach you with," he said, in a low&#xD;
isted between us; as I walked by his side in the agitated voice ; "and if your own conscience does&#xD;
cold moonlight, silent and unhappy, I could not not acquaint you with the cause of my anger, I&#xD;
resist stealing a glance at his face, half expect- shall have no hesitation in pronoincig it as&#xD;
ing that it would seem as unnatural as were the unreasonable as it certainly was unjust."&#xD;
circumstances which surrounded me. It was     "Is it because I have been doing that-writing&#xD;
changed, indeed ; stern and moody in expres- for Mr. Frank, instead of attending to my own&#xD;
sion, the eves downcast, the brow clouded, the duties ?" I asked timidly, after a moment's&#xD;
mouth rigidly compressed ; unlike, in all btit pause, finding that my conscience refused to&#xD;
mere feature and coloring, the kind genial face submit any evidence of a more satisfactory na-&#xD;
&#xD;
wIch hiad become so dear to me ; and yet, in&#xD;
spite of the sternness, or rather, I should say,&#xD;
mingled with the sternness, there was a look of&#xD;
deep despondency, of trouble and anxiety, which&#xD;
made my heart ache for him, and inspired me&#xD;
with sudden courage to carry out a resolution&#xD;
which for some days past I had been forming&#xD;
-the resolve to remove, if words of mine could&#xD;
do so, the dark shadows of reserve and suspicions&#xD;
which had so mysteriously sprung up between Us.&#xD;
Without pausing to select appropriate words&#xD;
with which to make my appeal, I broke forth&#xD;
abruptly--" Mr. IHarriugton, why are you angry&#xD;
with me ? What have I (1one0? I am qtuitec&#xD;
ready to promise beforehand, like the children,&#xD;
that whatever may have been my offense, I will&#xD;
never do so again,' if you will only be friends&#xD;
with me once more; you have been so very&#xD;
kind to me, and I have so few friends, that 1 can&#xD;
not bear to lose your esteem; and I am sure if&#xD;
vou knew how much I have suuffecred from your&#xD;
changed manner to me, you would overlook my&#xD;
unconscious offense, and be kind to me as you&#xD;
used to be." Aid then my faltering voice quite&#xD;
deserted me, and I could only look beseeching-&#xD;
ly in his face, and tremble at my own daring&#xD;
words.&#xD;
&#xD;
ture.&#xD;
"You know it is not that !" he cried vehie-&#xD;
mently.  "What difference do y u suppose&#xD;
Mr. Frank's whims could make in ny feelings&#xD;
toward you, unless you yourself inested them&#xD;
with importance.  Give me a downright nega-&#xD;
tive to one question, and I will admit myself to&#xD;
be the most unreasonable, suspicious fool that&#xD;
ever strove to understand a woman." He paused&#xD;
for a moment, but kept his'eyes upon my face&#xD;
eagerly, searchingly, as if he would read my&#xD;
very soul.  "Caroline, do you love Frank Net-&#xD;
tleby ?"&#xD;
An indignant negative sprang to rmy lips, but&#xD;
just at that instant the remembrance of the&#xD;
scene in the wareroom flashed upon my mind,&#xD;
and it suddenly occurred to me that Mr. Har-&#xD;
rington had by some means become aware of&#xD;
the proposal which Mr. Nettleby had made to&#xD;
me, and perhaps he, too, thought, us I felt cer-&#xD;
tain IMr. Frank himself did, that I was only&#xD;
waiting for the renewal of the offer to accept it.&#xD;
It was this idea which had caused the change&#xD;
in his manner toward me. The knowledge that&#xD;
Mr. Harrington should have had cause to think&#xD;
thus of me, so overpowered me with mortifica-&#xD;
tion that I could fid no words with which to&#xD;
&#xD;
F. N. AND "TILE GOVERNOR."           41&#xD;
&#xD;
answer him.   The blood rushed to my face&#xD;
until my very temples were crimsoned with&#xD;
shame, and my eyes filled with tears of vexa-&#xD;
tion, and sunk confusedly to the ground.&#xD;
"I am   answered," he said, dropping my&#xD;
hand hastily as he spoke; "there is not an hon-&#xD;
est woman in the world, so truth it is vain to&#xD;
expect from you ; but that tell-tale blush is more&#xD;
eloquent than words ; I will force from you no&#xD;
farther confessions."  He checked himself ab-&#xD;
ruptly, and we walked on again in miserable si-&#xD;
lence. I could not then have commanded my&#xD;
voice sufficiently to have spoken intelligibly, and&#xD;
I would not have undeceived him if I could; I&#xD;
was too angry and indignant at that moment to&#xD;
care what the consequences of his self-delusion&#xD;
might be ; that lie of all others should so mis-&#xD;
judge me!   My proud heart was almost burst-&#xD;
ing with its agony of rage and mortification,&#xD;
and not for worlds would I have made any far-&#xD;
ther attempts to conciliate him. Mr. Ilarrngton&#xD;
seemed scarcely less agitated than I was myself,&#xD;
hut I gave him no encouragement to pursue the&#xD;
distasteful subject, so in proud silence we finish-&#xD;
ed our walk.&#xD;
I bade him  good-night almost inaudibly; as&#xD;
he threw open my door, he lifted his hat in&#xD;
cold civility, but made no farther answer ; and&#xD;
thus we parted, more widely separated than be-&#xD;
fore, for now there was a sense of bitterness&#xD;
against him in my heart which heretofore I had&#xD;
never felt.&#xD;
"I hope you and John had a pleasant walk&#xD;
home, last evening?" said Miss Harrington to&#xD;
me next morning.&#xD;
"Oh! certainly," I answered, with a tremen-&#xD;
dous effort to seem unconcerned, and the good&#xD;
lady turned away from me with a discontented&#xD;
humphh !" which told me that she by no means&#xD;
credited my assertion.&#xD;
Of course the events of this evening did not in-&#xD;
crease my affection for Mi'. Nettleby, and a very&#xD;
cross assistant he found in me next morning. I&#xD;
could not see that my irritability had much ef-&#xD;
feet upon him, however, for he remained with&#xD;
me quite as long, and made himself quite am&#xD;
agreeable as ever. And thins two weeks moe&#xD;
sped on, marked by a haughty reserve on "thI&#xD;
governor's" part, and daily increasing affabil&#xD;
ity in Mr. Thank, and then, at last, matter&#xD;
&#xD;
leave the store. Mr. Harrington stood at the&#xD;
door, and after a momentary hesitation, just as&#xD;
I was ready to start out into the storm, lie ad-&#xD;
dressed me, his color heightening as he spoke.&#xD;
"It is too dark for you to go home alone, Miss&#xD;
Manvers; I trust that I may be allowed the&#xD;
pleasure of accompanying you."&#xD;
lie had just spoken the words when Frank&#xD;
Nettleby came hurrying up, " Never mind,&#xD;
Harrington," he said, in his '' take-it-for-grant-&#xD;
ed" fashion, " I am going in the same direction&#xD;
Miss Manvers is, and I will see her home with&#xD;
the greatest of pleasure ;" and throwing away a&#xD;
cigar he had just lighted, lie unfurled his um-&#xD;
brella, and stepping out of the store, cool and&#xD;
imperturbable, seemed waiting for me to follow&#xD;
him.&#xD;
I was strongly tempted to cling to " the gov-&#xD;
ernor's" arm, as I had done once before, whlien&#xD;
called upon to choose between them, and thus&#xD;
again strive to quench Mr. Frank's unblenching&#xD;
audacity. Upon second thought, however, I rc-&#xD;
solved to make no choice. " I am much obliged&#xD;
to both of you," I said, " but I shall get along&#xD;
very well by myself, and need no escort at all.'&#xD;
And I walked off independently into the storm.&#xD;
It was really very dark, but I did not feel&#xD;
much alarm but that between them both I should&#xD;
reach home in safety, and a quick step behind&#xD;
me proved that I had not been mistaken in my&#xD;
anticipations. As I had expected, it was Mr.&#xD;
Frank.   "You will have it; so be it then," I&#xD;
muttered between my teeth, and having no es-&#xD;
cape save by downright incivility, I accepted ils&#xD;
offered aria with as good a grace as I could com-&#xD;
- mand.&#xD;
lIIe chatted gayly for some time in his own&#xD;
peculiarly insouciant manner', but I was in no&#xD;
mood for gayety, and spite of himself infiono-&#xD;
syllabic responses soon brought him to a pause.&#xD;
- At last after a few moments' silence he resumed&#xD;
the conversation by saying in a more serious&#xD;
[ tone than he had yet used, " Miss Caro, do you&#xD;
not think I have waited long enough for an&#xD;
answer to the question I asked you a month&#xD;
s ago?"&#xD;
" I am afraid you will have to propoiinl your&#xD;
e question anew, Mr. Nettleby, if there has been&#xD;
one remaining unanswered for so long a time,"&#xD;
s I replied, trying to speak easily and unconcern-&#xD;
&#xD;
came to a crisis.                            edly.&#xD;
Again, from one cause or another, which I    "Do not trifle with me !" he cried impeti-&#xD;
have now forgotten, was Miss Jenny absent from  ously.  "I am in earnest now, my dearest girl,&#xD;

42                  MY HUSBAND'S CRIME.&#xD;
&#xD;
kindled a passion in my careless breast which I&#xD;
had not believed it possible I could feel. Car-&#xD;
oline, once you refused to marry me, because&#xD;
you said that I entertained for you no feeling&#xD;
warmer than compassion. That plea can avail&#xD;
you nothing now, for with all my heart and soul&#xD;
I love you. Speak to me, dearest, tell me that&#xD;
I do not love in vain."&#xD;
"I can not tell you so, Mr. Nettleby," I an-&#xD;
swered in a low, irmts voice.&#xD;
Ile started with undisguised astonishment.&#xD;
"I fear you do not understand sme," he said.&#xD;
I have told you that I love you ; of course its&#xD;
saying that, I intend you to understand that I&#xD;
ask you to become my wife."&#xD;
"And I intend you to understand that I de-&#xD;
cline the honor, sir," I answered haughtily, for&#xD;
the man's arrogance angered me.&#xD;
Ie stopped abruptly in the street, checking&#xD;
my progress with his own.  " Caroline, what&#xD;
have I done to deserve this? how have I offend-&#xD;
ed you? why are you angry at me ?"&#xD;
"Pray do not stop me in the public streets to&#xD;
call me to account," I said pettishly, pulling him&#xD;
forward as I spoke.  "See, the passers-by are&#xD;
all staring at us. I am not angry with you at&#xD;
all. Ont the contrary, I am sorry for your dis-&#xD;
appointment, and still more sorry that this afftair&#xD;
should have gone so far as it has done. I am&#xD;
sure-and you will acknowledge yourself, if you&#xD;
look back upon the events of the last few weeks&#xD;
-that in no possible way has my conduct given&#xD;
you any encouragement to renew the generous&#xD;
proposal you made to me when you thought my&#xD;
honor and happiness depended upon your doing&#xD;
so. I declined it then, less decidedly perhaps&#xD;
than 1 should have done, yet for my indecision&#xD;
I am sure you will not hold me accountable, when&#xD;
you remember the circumstances by which I was&#xD;
then surrounded, and how terribly tempted I&#xD;
must have been to accept your offer. I with-&#xD;
stood temptation then, and I find no difficulty&#xD;
in doing so now.  Again I decline the honor&#xD;
you offer me, this time positively and finally,&#xD;
with. thanks, however, and the kindest possible&#xD;
feeling toward you."&#xD;
"But why ?" he cried, indignation and&#xD;
amazement mingling in his tone.  " I know&#xD;
that I am worthy of your love, were it only by&#xD;
the depth of the passion I feel for you. I am&#xD;
no coxcomb, Miss Manvers, but it surely is al-&#xD;
lowabhe in me to say that I anm young, wealthy,&#xD;
educated, laying claim to the manners and title&#xD;
of a gentleman, and at least passably good-look-&#xD;
ing. If you are por I can give you wealth ;&#xD;
if yon are proud, I can give you station ;if you&#xD;
are amubitiouis, you shall teach mue to be so like-&#xD;
&#xD;
wise, and together we will rise to any height to&#xD;
which our capacities will bear us. Are you&#xD;
friendless? I will give you love, ardent, passion-&#xD;
ate love as ever blessed a woman's lot, or crowned&#xD;
her brow with glory. Reflect, Caroline ; re-&#xD;
member all that it is in my power to bestow&#xD;
upon you ; recall your hasty words, and say that&#xD;
you will yet be mine."&#xD;
"Your eloquence is all in vain, Mr. Nettleby,"&#xD;
I answered, my voice not quite so steady as I&#xD;
could have wished it.  "All your arguments&#xD;
are worse than useless when opposed to the one&#xD;
unanswerable fact, that I do not love you. Be-&#xD;
lieve me, I appreciate all your good qualities as&#xD;
fully as you can desire, not the least of which is&#xD;
the noble disinterestedness with which you have&#xD;
loved and wooed a woman so far beneath your-&#xD;
self in worldly station. Most sincerely grateful&#xD;
am I for the good opinion which you profess to&#xD;
feel for me, and as a man and a gentleman, I&#xD;
regard you with sentiments of unfeigned respect&#xD;
and admiration ; but something more than this&#xD;
you must inspire, before I can consent to marry&#xD;
you ; that something you have never awakened&#xD;
in my breast, and I dare not bid you hope that&#xD;
you ever can. I speak to you plainly because I&#xD;
think it better to terminate at once and f ever&#xD;
an illusion which has been no more painful in&#xD;
its effects to you than to me."&#xD;
'  Plain enough, upon my soul !" he cried,&#xD;
angrily.  "Pray gratify this candid spirit by&#xD;
answering me as plainly one question more, and&#xD;
I will torment you no farther. Even after all&#xD;
you have said, I shall not consider such grounid-&#xD;
less objections as entirely unsurmountable un-&#xD;
less you can tell me that you love another. In&#xD;
that case only can I bring myself to believe that&#xD;
my suit is hopeless."&#xD;
I felt that I owed him more consideration&#xD;
than an ordinary suitor could have claimed. I&#xD;
knew, too, that in his honor I could safely con-&#xD;
fide, and that in any case my secret would be&#xD;
held sacred by him, so after a moment's hesita-&#xD;
tion, I said: "If that knowledge alone can sat-&#xD;
isfy you, Mr. Nettleby, I will not be heartless&#xD;
enough to withhold it. I do love another."&#xD;
"Ileaven help me ! I ought to have known&#xD;
it; I have suspected it for some time past," he&#xD;
groaned in tones of genuine anguish. Then he&#xD;
cried, " Ah ! Caroline, I have your secret now'&#xD;
What price do you suppose a certain gentleman&#xD;
would give to know it?  And what direful spell&#xD;
have you cast upon me, that makes me feel just&#xD;
now that the rarest pleasure earth can give&#xD;
would be to cut that fellow's throat, and whisper&#xD;
your secret to him imn his death struggles."&#xD;
"Ilush ! hsushs ! for shame, Mr. Frank ; I&#xD;
&#xD;
"HE STOPPED ABRUPTLY IN THE STREET."-PAGE 42.&#xD;
&#xD;

"THE GOVERNOR&#xD;
&#xD;
will not hear you talk so even in jest," I cried.&#xD;
I know my secret is safe with you ; I have&#xD;
proved you to be a gentleman, or you had never&#xD;
known it.  And now I am home ; we must part&#xD;
here, and let us drop this subject now and for-&#xD;
ever. If you had'ever given me the shadow of&#xD;
a chance, I would have spared you the pain of&#xD;
this refusal, but you would not; you took it for&#xD;
granted from the very start that I would marry&#xD;
you, and-with that idea in your head you have&#xD;
been laboring for the past month, not to make&#xD;
me love you-that you considered a superfluous&#xD;
task-but to teach yourself to love me.  Your&#xD;
offer was made at first thoughtlessly, yet through&#xD;
such generous impulses, that had my heart been&#xD;
free, it must have appreciated the act, and I&#xD;
might perhaps from then have learned to love&#xD;
von. That offer you considered binding, how-&#xD;
ever, only if I proved worthy of the honor you&#xD;
had done me, and to enable you to form a de-&#xD;
cision upon the subject has been the only aim&#xD;
of your courtship. That the conclusion you&#xD;
arrived at was a flattering one to me, 1 suppose&#xD;
the conversation of this evening proves. That&#xD;
is all I have to say, and now you must let me&#xD;
bid you good-night."&#xD;
"You are a witch !" he cried, "and an un-&#xD;
charitalde one at that.  You certainly have&#xD;
cured me of a propensity for taking things for&#xD;
granted to which I have always been subject&#xD;
Your remedy has been a severe one though, and&#xD;
has destroyed completely all inclination for love&#xD;
or matrimony in which I may have been fool&#xD;
enough to have indulged. however faulty you&#xD;
may deem my method of courtship, I assure you&#xD;
I have been inspired to it by a love as pure and&#xD;
earnest as ever man felt for woman   I have&#xD;
wasted upon you the passion of a life time, and&#xD;
ll that I have received in exchange has been&#xD;
a lecture upon self-conceit, and-a manuscript&#xD;
edition of Nettleby &amp;amp; Son's bills of sales."&#xD;
He strode off into the darkness without farther&#xD;
leave-taking, and scarcely knowing whether to&#xD;
laugh or to cry, as the words of this last eharac-&#xD;
terisfie speech rang in my ears, I entered the&#xD;
house, and during the long monotonous hours&#xD;
that followed before bed-time, I steadily plied&#xD;
my needle and wondered whether Mr. Harring-&#xD;
ton would ever find out that I had refused Frank&#xD;
Nettleby.&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
"THE GOVERNOR" ENLIGHTENED.&#xD;
TuE blank book and its owner did not make&#xD;
their appearance next day in the shawl-depart-&#xD;
mnut, and though I could easily have accounted&#xD;

&#xD;
" ENLIGHTENED.                          43&#xD;
for their absence, outsiders, mistaking effect for&#xD;
cause, concluded that I was neglected on account&#xD;
of Mr. Frank's absence from town, " on busi-&#xD;
ness," his father said.  At all events, he did&#xD;
not make his appearance in the store until&#xD;
toward the close of the day, and then he did not&#xD;
come near me until he saw me getting ready to&#xD;
leave the store.&#xD;
lie had been standing at his father's desk with&#xD;
Mr. Ilarrington, examining some papers that&#xD;
the latter had produced for his inspection ; but&#xD;
when lie saw mie lie left his companions abrupt-&#xD;
ly, and hurried toward me.&#xD;
" Shake hands before you go, Miss Caro, and&#xD;
tell me you are not affronted," he said.&#xD;
Of course I obeyed.&#xD;
Haven't repented your cruelty yet, I sup-&#xD;
pose?" lie continued, half in jest, half in ear-&#xD;
nest.&#xD;
" No, I have not, Mr. Nettleby," I said sharp-&#xD;
ly, trying to draw my hand away from him, but&#xD;
he held it tightly.&#xD;
Don't be so cross," he said pathetically.&#xD;
I can not imagine how -you can nurse wrath&#xD;
against so helpless a fellow as I am. When I&#xD;
left you last night I was about as well wrought&#xD;
up for hatred and revenge, and all that sort of&#xD;
thing, as the bloodiest hero of the bloodiest melo-&#xD;
drama you ever saw. I left town this morning&#xD;
on purpose to avoid you and my rival, for posi-&#xD;
tively I was not certain but that I might be&#xD;
temp ted to commit soein terrible act of violence&#xD;
whip under the influence of such savage emo-&#xD;
tion. I left town, and have amused myself all&#xD;
day by galloping over the country and wreaking&#xD;
all manner of direful vengeance upon your de-&#xD;
voted head ; but Nemesis is appeased now, and&#xD;
I have come back fully resolved to forget and&#xD;
forgive; nay, more; in such an amiable tensper do&#xD;
you see inc at present, that, upon my soul! I&#xD;
should really be tempted to renew my offei' if&#xD;
you would give me the least encouragement."&#xD;
''I most certainly shall not do so then,'' I said,&#xD;
laughing at his whimsical speech, though I saw&#xD;
traces of genuine feeling in his face as lie spoke,&#xD;
and I knew that it was not all intended for jest.&#xD;
"There is no hope, then ?"' and he gazed wist-&#xD;
fully into my face.&#xD;
"None whatever. God bless you, Mr. Frank,&#xD;
and give you a more loving wife than you could&#xD;
ever find in me !" And then I hurried away.&#xD;
I had got some distance from the store, when&#xD;
I remembered that I had left my gloves lying&#xD;
uponl iny desk, so I retraced miy steps in order to&#xD;
get them. I re-entered the building hy a side-&#xD;
door ; it was nearly deserted ; all the girls had&#xD;
left, and there were remaining only a fewv of the&#xD;

&#xD;
young men, hurrying through their concluding&#xD;
duties, eager to get away also. Mr. Harrington&#xD;
and Mr. Nettleby still were at the desk, and&#xD;
Mr. Frank w'as sauntering slowly up to them as'&#xD;
I came in. As I was anxious to avoid his no-&#xD;
tice, I slipped into the shawl-room as noiselessly&#xD;
as possible, and catching up my gloves, I was&#xD;
about to depart, when I caught the sound of my&#xD;
name spoken by Mr. Nettleby, senior, and in-&#xD;
voluntarily I stopped to listen.&#xD;
Yes, stopped to listen; there is no denying&#xD;
the fact. At first I did so thoughtlessly, and&#xD;
with no thought of hearing what was not in-&#xD;
tended for my ears ; but as the conversation pro-&#xD;
gressed, with shame I acknowledge that I tar-&#xD;
ried purposely, willfully, chained to the spot by&#xD;
eager, breathless curiosity, and deaf for the time&#xD;
to the indignant voice of outraged honor, and&#xD;
the whisperings of conscience. I listened, and&#xD;
this is what I heard :&#xD;
It was Mr. Nettleby who was speaking. "I&#xD;
believe the Manvers has really made an im-&#xD;
- Iression upon you, F. N.  Seems to me the af-&#xD;
,fair is becoming serious, eh ?"&#xD;
"If you want me to answer you, say Miss&#xD;
Manvers, father," answered Mr. Frank in very&#xD;
different tones from those he had lately used in&#xD;
addressing me.   "If there is any one vulgar&#xD;
thing I hate worse than another, it is the habit&#xD;
we maen have of speaking of a respectable woman&#xD;
in such a disrespectful way. If you had lin-&#xD;
gered as often and as long in the anterrooms of&#xD;
the Paris theatres as I have done, you would&#xD;
have heard enough of such talk to disgust you&#xD;
with it for a life-time."&#xD;
" Ear! hear! hear !" cried his worthy fa..&#xD;
ther, putting his delicate hands softly together&#xD;
in mock applause.  " Is it not wonderful, Iar-&#xD;
rington, what a good little boy we have raised ?&#xD;
lie is a credit to our management.  Every body&#xD;
used to prophesy that he would come to ruin,&#xD;
but he has gone the rounds of continental dissi-&#xD;
pation, and returned, addicted to no more serious&#xD;
vices than a tendency to lecture his papa, and&#xD;
fall in love with the shop-girls."&#xD;
Mr. Harrington did not see fit to respond to&#xD;
his employer's witty remarks, but addressed him-&#xD;
self directly to Mr. Frank. " If the lady you&#xD;
refer to has been spoken of with disrespect, Mr.&#xD;
Frank, I think you have no one to blame but&#xD;
yourself. rTh doubtful nature of your conduct&#xD;
toward her, the marked attention with which&#xD;
you have favored her during the past month,&#xD;
has drawn upon her from all sources comments&#xD;
neither delicate mnor pleasant ; comments that I&#xD;
shonld imagine would have booms a source of&#xD;
great distress anti anxiety to her, had not her&#xD;
&#xD;
pleasure-in the cause possibly have blinded her&#xD;
to the unpleasantness of the effects. It scarcely&#xD;
becomes you, who have occasioned this state of&#xD;
affairs, to censure others for language which&#xD;
your own imprudence has provoked." It would&#xD;
have been a great relief to my feelings, at that&#xD;
moment, if I could have boxed John larring-&#xD;
ton's ears soundly for that delightful speech.&#xD;
Prudence restrained all outward signs of wrath,&#xD;
however, and I calmed my excitement suflicient-&#xD;
ly to give my attention to Mr. Frank again as&#xD;
he spoke wrathily to his lecturer.&#xD;
"I should like very much to be informed who&#xD;
it is that dares insult, by groundless gossip or in-&#xD;
delicate jest, a young lady for whom I feel the&#xD;
highest respect, and in whom I have no hesitation&#xD;
in declaring my feelings are very much interest-&#xD;
ed; one to whom I have never in my life addressed&#xD;
a syllable that a princess of the blood-royal need&#xD;
refuse to hear. If you can point out any such&#xD;
individual, or if I can discover him for myself,&#xD;
I shall certainly so far constitute myself the&#xD;
lady's champion as to thrash him within an&#xD;
inch of his life."&#xD;
"I assure you, Mr. Frank," said "the gov-&#xD;
ernor,'' dryly, " lam not the individual in ques-&#xD;
tion, so waste no wrathful looks upon me. On&#xD;
the contrary, the lady possesses no warmer&#xD;
friends than myself and my sister, nor are there&#xD;
any who have her interests more at heart. If&#xD;
I spoke as'I did concerning her, it was only&#xD;
from a desire to ascertain the true nature of&#xD;
your feelings for her ; by no means from any&#xD;
disrespect to her. ' Your indignation, I am hap.&#xD;
py to say, has appeased any doubts I may have&#xD;
entertained concerning the serious nature of&#xD;
your attentions to her."&#xD;
"Serious intentions ! Ha ! ha ! ha !" and&#xD;
Mr. Frank's laugh rang bitterly through the&#xD;
store. "By that I suppose you mean intentions&#xD;
tending toward matrimony. Serious attentions!&#xD;
Ha! ha! ha!"&#xD;
"The governor" brought the young gentle-&#xD;
man's mirth to an untimely termination by say-&#xD;
ing, in a voice so stern and angry that I could&#xD;
hardly recognize it as his, "Frank Nettleby,&#xD;
can it be possible that you are a scoundrel?&#xD;
Can it be possible that by every means in your&#xD;
power you have sought to win the affections of&#xD;
that girl, and that now, when in all human prob-&#xD;
ability you have succeeded, you intend to cast&#xD;
her aside, and to view the whole affair in the&#xD;
light of a meaningless flirtation ?  Can it be&#xD;
possible that you have only been amusing your-&#xD;
self by thme attemtins you have paid her during&#xD;
the past month ?"&#xD;
"Hold your horses, if I may be permitted&#xD;

&#xD;
the inelegant remark, you are a mile ahead&#xD;
of the mark now, oh! Daniel come to judg-&#xD;
ment," cried Frank again with that bitter un-&#xD;
natural laugh.  ''I have succeeded in winning&#xD;
the young lady's affections, have I? and her&#xD;
feelings are interested in my unworthy self, are&#xD;
they?  A very queer way she has of showing&#xD;
her interest, then, is all I have to say. I last&#xD;
night did myself the honor of offering my hand,&#xD;
heart, and fortune for her gracious acceptance,&#xD;
and the three articles were returned upon my&#xD;
hands, with as contemptuous a 'No, I thank&#xD;
you,' as a harmless young man ever received.&#xD;
Been amusing myself, have I ? Lord ! what a&#xD;
fanny pastime it has been !"&#xD;
Involuntary exclamations of surprise broke&#xD;
from both his hearers.&#xD;
" Bless my soul! F. N., you don't mean to&#xD;
say you have gone as far as that ! You don't&#xD;
surely mean to say you have made such a fool&#xD;
of yourself!" cried Mr. Nettleby.  " And-"&#xD;
"You have been refused by Caroline Man-&#xD;
vers ? Do you seriously tell us that you oflred&#xD;
yourself to her and she refused you ?" cried&#xD;
"the governor."&#xD;
"There is no need of making such a noise&#xD;
about it," said the young gentleman sulkily ;&#xD;
"I suppose I ant not the first man in the world&#xD;
who has been mittened by a woman. I plead&#xD;
guilty to all the counts in the indictment, but&#xD;
it isn't the pleasantest thing in the world to me&#xD;
to hear the story rehearsed. I have told you&#xD;
two the truth, but remember I don't want it to&#xD;
go any farther."&#xD;
"I am    astonished," drawled  his father.&#xD;
"With no intention to be personal, you will&#xD;
pardon me for quoting the proverb, 'A fool for&#xD;
luck.' You have made a narrow escape, F. N.,&#xD;
allow inc to congratulate you. You deserved&#xD;
to have been accepted'; you have made a nar-&#xD;
row escape."&#xD;
"Wider by a damned sight than pleased&#xD;
me," growled Frank between his teeth, and his&#xD;
father went on. " Not that I should have in-&#xD;
terfered in your arrangements at all; do not&#xD;
misunderstand me, the satisfaction 'which I feel&#xD;
at your escape is purely disinterested ; the rale&#xD;
of cruel father is the last one which could be&#xD;
imposed upon me.  No, my dear sir, the emo-&#xD;
tion which your unexpected information chiefly&#xD;
excites in tay bosom, is at this moment only&#xD;
surprise, pure, unmitigated surprise ; for where,&#xD;
tell me where, do you see any thing in the dam-&#xD;
eel in question, to warrant you in making such&#xD;
a donkey of yourself as you acknowledge to&#xD;
having done ?"&#xD;
" Ask Ilarrington, lhe knows," said Mr. Frank&#xD;
&#xD;
spitefully, but "the governor" deigning no re-&#xD;
sponse to this side-stroke, Mr. Nettleby re-&#xD;
sumed.   ' She has a fine hand, yes, I renei-&#xD;
ber noticing that ; she hus a very fine hand,&#xD;
and she is a tall, shapely young woman enough,&#xD;
but I'll wager you a cool fifty, F. N., that for&#xD;
every homelier girl you can point out to me in&#xD;
the store, I will find you two handsomer ones.&#xD;
A  sickly, sallow, sulky, commonplace-looking&#xD;
woman."   And the gentleman wound up the&#xD;
string of alliterative epithets with which lie&#xD;
had honored me by a contemptuous " Bali&#xD;
My quondam   lover caught up the cudgels&#xD;
manfully in my defense. ""You know nothing&#xD;
at all about her," he cried dutifully. "She is&#xD;
not one of the milk-and-water doll-habies that&#xD;
I suppose you would admire, and I do not sill)-&#xD;
pose any one would dream  of calling her 'a&#xD;
pretty woman.' I have seen that article ho&#xD;
scores in my travels, and none of them ran anv&#xD;
risk of becoming Mrs. Frank Nettlehy. I wore&#xD;
my heart upon my sleeve, and the pretty daws&#xD;
all peeked at it, but it was tough enough to&#xD;
withstand all attacks, until I met the magnifi-&#xD;
cent eyes that flashed a saucy ' No !' at me.&#xD;
last night. Sulky ! conunouplace ! you think&#xD;
her ? By Jove, sir ! there is more heart, .more&#xD;
character in that woman, than-than--" and&#xD;
stammering a moment for a comparison, he at&#xD;
last went gallantly on-  than I am able to ap-&#xD;
preciate. If you had seen her as I have done,&#xD;
her face under the influence of strong emotion,&#xD;
white, piteous, appealing, the clear, sharp (utt-&#xD;
line of her features thrown markedly forth, the&#xD;
sweet mouth with its varying lines and slhalows&#xD;
a study for a painter; those large, clear eyes,&#xD;
shadowed by their heavy lashes, turned with&#xD;
wild, beseeching pathos to your face ; if you&#xD;
could have seen all this, father, and at the&#xD;
same time have clasped within your arms the&#xD;
slender, shrinking form, and felt the pressure&#xD;
of that fairy hand, I solemnly believe that it&#xD;
would have been through no fault of yours that&#xD;
I can not at this moment salute Miss Manvers&#xD;
as my step-mother."&#xD;
"The boy is certainly bewitched !" cried his&#xD;
father-and I really could not blame him for&#xD;
thinking so.&#xD;
"If I am, I am not the only victim," was the&#xD;
pettish rejoinder.  "Turn your arms upon Iar-&#xD;

&#xD;
"THE GOVERNOR" ENLIGHTENED.          47&#xD;
&#xD;
I believed in my heart that he was really no&#xD;
more in love with me than I was with him.&#xD;
Yet I was not ignorant that the sorrows of the&#xD;
imginationare always as keenly felt and&#xD;
sometimes as hard to bear as are the sterner&#xD;
ones of reality. If Mr. Frank imagined that&#xD;
ie was suffering from the pangs of disappoint-&#xD;
ed love, mistaking for them the grievous sensa-&#xD;
tion of mortified vanity and anticipated ridi-&#xD;
cule, I liked him well enough to feel quite as&#xD;
much sympathy for his distress as if it had&#xD;
arisen from a less commonplace cause. lie&#xD;
had borne his troubles so nobly, that I could&#xD;
not help but respect him, even while I laughed&#xD;
at him.   The generous, candid nature had&#xD;
come unstained through a trial more dangerous&#xD;
to its purity, perhaps, than real suffering would&#xD;
have been. There was not a shadow of resent-&#xD;
ment rankling in that noble heart, either to-&#xD;
ward me or toward the one whom he consider-&#xD;
ed his rival, for spite of the melo-dramatic&#xD;
speeches with which he had favored me, I knew&#xD;
very well that he felt no more real anger&#xD;
against me than I did against him ; and that&#xD;
was saying a great deal, for I had never been&#xD;
nearer being what is called "in love" with my&#xD;
young employer than 1 had been that evening&#xD;
---was now. Without a particle of sentiment,&#xD;
with no shadow of romance or thought of pas-&#xD;
sion, my mind yet dwelt almost regretfully on&#xD;
the loyal heart that I had thrown from my&#xD;
grasp, a heart capable of making the happiness&#xD;
of any woman, a heart that seemed now utterly&#xD;
lonely and unloved, for, spite of all his worldly&#xD;
advantages, Mr. Frank had really been de-&#xD;
privedi of all the truest happiness that earth&#xD;
can bestow.  No mother's and-no sisters love&#xD;
had ever blessed his life. No good woman&#xD;
had ever cared for him, as only good women&#xD;
can; and the tie between his father and him.&#xD;
self was such an anomalous one, that it really&#xD;
could have brought to him very little comfort.&#xD;
"God bless you, Mr. Frank, and bestow&#xD;
upon you finally a home in which you will bC&#xD;
appreciated as you ought to be !" was thu&#xD;
termination of my soliloquy, as far as ie wa&#xD;
concerned. And then my thoughts betook&#xD;
themselves at last to the consideration of a sub&#xD;
ject yet more interesting, a subject which&#xD;
quickened my pulses and flushed my cheeks&#xD;
and awakened in me that wild, delicious hap&#xD;
piness which never comes but once to th&#xD;
heart of woman.&#xD;
Frank Nettleby had said that " the govern&#xD;
or" loved me-was this so ? dared I believ&#xD;
it ? or -was it but the outbreak of a causeles&#xD;
jealousy, which found food for suspicion in th&#xD;
&#xD;
most unlikely object? His words still sounded&#xD;
in my ears, and even in the darkening shades&#xD;
of twilight the hot blood mounted to my face,&#xD;
and burned in-my cheeks, till I was fain to bow&#xD;
my head upon my hands, and cover it even from&#xD;
the gaze of the stars.   "It is not every&#xD;
woman who could have run unscathed the&#xD;
gauntlet of those keen eyes, and have intrench-&#xD;
ed herself within that fortified breast ; and&#xD;
yet the sickly, sallow, sulky one has done this!.&#xD;
And it was while these words were echoing in&#xD;
my heart, while my burning face was yet buried&#xD;
in my hands, that a fanmihiar footstep fell upon&#xD;
the pavement in front of me, and a fanhiar&#xD;
voice greeted my ear.&#xD;
Good-evening ! Miss C'aroliine." Wih ma&#xD;
guilty start I lifted my head to behold Mr. Ilar-&#xD;
rington standing before me. For an instant I&#xD;
felt almost as scared as if ie had been aie to&#xD;
read the thoughts which but now hadl possessel&#xD;
me ; and yet I need-not have been alarmed, for&#xD;
certainly an humbler man never stool before&#xD;
woman than, hat in hand, now awaited my&#xD;
greeting.&#xD;
" I beg your pardon, Mr. Ikularriugtn it&#xD;
has grown so dark that I hardly knew you,'&#xD;
was the polite fiction with which I finally en-&#xD;
deavored to excuse ny enbarrassment. '' Wall&#xD;
ill ; I will light a lamp in an distant "&#xD;
" No ! no ! do not go in !" hue stammered,&#xD;
scarcely less confused than myself ''It i,&#xD;
much pleasanter out here, and, if you wii per-&#xD;
mit, I will sit with you here on the step awhile&#xD;
T I shall not detain you long."&#xD;
So I remained, and he seated himself upon&#xD;
ithe step below me, leaning his elbow on the&#xD;
one upon which I sat, and gazed upon tie&#xD;
ground silent and thoughtful.&#xD;
I tried to chat upon the topics of the day,&#xD;
- unconcernedly and freely, as if our long es-&#xD;
trangement had been a dream, amnd there hia&#xD;
been no break in the friendly intercourse oif the&#xD;
v preceding winter ; but I found that indifferent&#xD;
e subjects were rather hard things to manage be-&#xD;
e tween two individuals who had been almost at&#xD;
s sword's point, understood if not expressed, for&#xD;
k more than two weeks past, and who, during&#xD;
- that time, had been thrown nto daily, almost&#xD;
hu hourly intercourse without exchanging one word&#xD;
, save such as business or common civility e-&#xD;
- manded. Time attempt was a ditffcult one to&#xD;

48                   MY HUSBAND'S CRIME.&#xD;
&#xD;
Indeed, he made no attempt to keep up the&#xD;
appearance of indifference ; monosyllabic re-&#xD;
sponses, or no responses at all, were all I re-&#xD;
ceived in return for my most brilliant conversa-&#xD;
tional efforts, and finally I, too, lapsed into si-&#xD;
lence, awkward indeed, but really less enibar-&#xD;
rassing than had been our previous attempts at&#xD;
conversation.&#xD;
At last he made a desperate plunge. " Miss&#xD;
Caroline, I have not been behaving right to you&#xD;
for some time past ; I have been angry at you&#xD;
causelessly, as I have now every reason to be-&#xD;
lieve, and even when you did me the honor to&#xD;
make an effort at conciliation, blinded and mis-&#xD;
led by my ownt mad passion, I was too miserable&#xD;
to receive your advances as I should have done,&#xD;
and by rejecting them I have added so incalcu-&#xD;
lably to my faults that I now dare scarcely hope&#xD;
that you will overlook them."&#xD;
Ihe charges he made against himself were&#xD;
so undeniably true, and I had felt them so deep-&#xD;
ly, that I could not in conscience contradict&#xD;
him, so I maintained an unbroken silence,&#xD;
though lie paused for some time evidently de-&#xD;
sirous of reassurance cre he proceeded ; none&#xD;
coming, he again desperately resunied.  " If&#xD;
my penitence were less heart-felt than it is ; if&#xD;
my consciousness of the wrongs I have done&#xD;
you were less acute, I should not have dared&#xD;
make this appeal ; as it is, I feel that these cx--&#xD;
planations are due to you, even although I ;mti&#xD;
almost hopeless of obtaining your pardon. Car-&#xD;
dine _!-" with a sudden burst of emotion that&#xD;
belied grievously his assertion of hopelessness&#xD;
"Caroline ! this estrangement has made me&#xD;
very unhappy, may we not be friends again ?"&#xD;
And then I found my tongue.   '' There has&#xD;
been no cessation of our friendship so far as I&#xD;
anm concerned, Mr. Harrington.''&#xD;
My pretty speech was received with a pet-&#xD;
ulance unexpected indeed in our dignified ''gov-&#xD;
ernor." ''Do ntot insult me by insincerity, Miss&#xD;
Manvers;   for anger, difference, scorn, I&#xD;
an prepared ; I have deserved them, but for&#xD;
Heaven's sake disguise not your real feelings&#xD;
behimtl the garb of cold civility, or I shall feel&#xD;
hopeless indeed of winning your pardon."&#xD;
"And yet you told me once that it was vain&#xD;
to expect truth from me ; how then can you&#xD;
be unprepared for insincerity ?"  And thus the&#xD;
hitter words which so long had rankled in my&#xD;
heart were brought to light, and the citadel of&#xD;
my pride was left defenseless.&#xD;
" Did I say that ?" he asked, meekly enough,&#xD;
for lae was thoroughly ashaimed of the senti-&#xD;
mntt now. "' Oh, Carolinec ! had you only&#xD;
ktiown the misery 1 endured when those words&#xD;
&#xD;
were forced from me, you would have forgotten&#xD;
them as soon as uttered. Be generous now, and&#xD;
overlook the past, if not for my sake, for Jet-&#xD;
ny's, who is worrying herself half sick, through&#xD;
anxiety to see us friends again. Shake hands,&#xD;
won't you?"&#xD;
I do not know to this day whether I did o1&#xD;
not, but I do know that somehow my hand&#xD;
was caught in his, and remained imprisoned&#xD;
throughout the whole of that memorable inter-&#xD;
view.&#xD;
"Entirely on Miss Jenny's account, though;&#xD;
remember that, sir !" I said.&#xD;
" It will not be the least of the services she has&#xD;
rendered me ; and I accept the pardon thank-&#xD;
fully upon whatever terms it is accorded.  And&#xD;
now, Caroline Manvers, let me 'put to you a&#xD;
question which has burned upon maay lips ever&#xD;
since I took my seat beside you. Wihy-from&#xD;
what imaginable motive-did you lead me to&#xD;
believe the other evening that yon loved Frank&#xD;
Nettleby, when from his own lips this evening,&#xD;
im the story of his rejection, I have learned that&#xD;
no such feeling over animated yodr breast ?"&#xD;
"I never led you to believe any such thing,"&#xD;
I said, a little indignantly.  "' I ritsunderstood&#xD;
the motive of your question, and from the con-&#xD;
fusion I evimced, you chose to draw a wrong&#xD;
conclusion, and leaped at once to the decision&#xD;
which misled you; I would not undeceive you&#xD;
then, for I was too grieved and indignant to do&#xD;
so; I-I thought you had ito right to misjudge&#xD;
me so."&#xD;
" I do not think my mistake was at all si-&#xD;
prising ; you blushed deeply whehi you heard&#xD;
my question, and your eyes, which until that&#xD;
moment had frankly met my own, tank in con~&#xD;
fusion to the ground. Surely these are the&#xD;
signs of conscious love, if the stories poets and&#xD;
novelists tell us be true ! You misunderstood&#xD;
the motive of my question, you say; what pos-&#xD;
sible construction could you have ut upon it,&#xD;
that could have caused such marked confu-&#xD;
sion ?"&#xD;
And then I told him Mr. Frank's first propos-&#xD;
al to me, saying, as I concluded the narrative,&#xD;
"I did feel sadly guilty that I had not given&#xD;
him at the time a more decided negative, for I&#xD;
well know that by consenting to leal'e the sub-&#xD;
ject unsettled, as by my silence I did, I virtual-&#xD;
ly encouraged him to expect a favorable re-&#xD;
sponse. His manner showed that he so under-&#xD;

But here I interrupted kim.  " have you me that you love me."&#xD;

&#xD;
"God forbid !" he ejaculated fervently. " I&#xD;
have the cause to plead of a far less worthy&#xD;
man than Frank Nettleby, yet one in whom I&#xD;
am much more interested. KInowing his fate,&#xD;
how dare I proceed !  If he, with all his noble&#xD;
qualities and worldly advantages, was unprosper-&#xD;
otis in his suit, on what possible grounds -can&#xD;
John Harrington hope for success ?"&#xD;
He paused as if expecting me to reply, but I&#xD;
retained perversely silent. Ie dropped my&#xD;
hand and rose slowly to his feet.&#xD;
"I understand," he said ; " your silence is&#xD;
expressive, and it it I read my fate.  All that&#xD;
now remains for me, is to thank you for the&#xD;
kindness that has spared me a harsher answer,&#xD;
and to take my leave."  And he was moving&#xD;
away when my words detained him.&#xD;
"You have asked me no question,'Mr. Har-&#xD;
rington, it is impossible that I can have given&#xD;
yeou any answer."&#xD;
One instant he stood gazing eagerly upon me,&#xD;
the next he had resumed his position on the&#xD;
Step.&#xD;
"Women are all born coquettes, I verily&#xD;
believe," he said.  "You have no pity upon&#xD;
the agitation and confusion which a man must&#xD;
tel when addressing y'ou upon the subject of love&#xD;
ad matrimony.  You tare ino kinder than the&#xD;

not a thought of past pleasure, of pre5ent con-&#xD;

ceives, that is not mingled with dreams of you.&#xD;
Since that evening when I left you after my first&#xD;
visit to your home, and looking, back saw you&#xD;
through the darkness of the night standing npon&#xD;
this very step, clad im your black robes, with&#xD;
your little sister clinging helplessly to your side,&#xD;
so lonely, so young and fair, so unprotected-&#xD;
from that moment I took you into my heart as&#xD;
I never before had taken a human being, and&#xD;
silently vowed that if my love could save you&#xD;
from the snares and troubles of the-world, your&#xD;
path should thenceforward be a pleasant one..&#xD;
0, my love ! will not this content you ? what&#xD;
else can I say to woo from you the answer my&#xD;
impatient spirit craves?" and casting aside the&#xD;
shy reserve which had always marked his con-&#xD;
duct toward me, he threw his arm around my&#xD;
waist, and drew me to his side, gazig imto my&#xD;
face with eyes whose eager passion not even the&#xD;
obscurity of the evening could conceal.&#xD;
And all the answer that I could make was to&#xD;

&#xD;
SHADOWS AND SUSPICIONS.               .59&#xD;
&#xD;
How fearful of her displeasure! I sometimes&#xD;
was almost tempted to deplore the poor lad's&#xD;
devotion to her, for she seemed so unconscious&#xD;
of the value of the heart she had won ; so care-4&#xD;
less of his feelings, so blind to his sufferings,&#xD;
that I could not help feeling, spite of my affec-&#xD;
tion for her, that she was unworthy of the love&#xD;
she had inspired. Agnes's conduct at this time&#xD;
was a great mystery to me. I could not for the&#xD;
life of me satisfactorily determine whether she&#xD;
loved Eddie Harrington or not.  She was such&#xD;
a merry, thoughtless little creature, so full of&#xD;
fun and mischief, that I sometimes was tempt-&#xD;
ed to believe that she was quite incapable of se-&#xD;
rious feeling of any kind. My love for her had&#xD;
never blinded me to the fact that her nature&#xD;
was not a very deep one, and that, charming as&#xD;
she was, the power of feeling very intensely had&#xD;
never been bestowed upon her. Eddie was her&#xD;
first admirer, and she took a girlish pleasure&#xD;
in the innocent little flirtation that would have&#xD;
been natural to her even were her feelings quite&#xD;
uninterested. Yet this, I could not believe, was&#xD;
the case.  Often when I came unexpectedly&#xD;
into the room where the young couple were&#xD;
sitting together, they would be absorbed in low-&#xD;
toned conversations that my presence would be&#xD;
sure to bring to an untimely conclusion. They&#xD;
would start away from each other, agitated and&#xD;
confused. And in Agnes's bright blushes and&#xD;
conscious looks, I could read but one interpreta-&#xD;
tion.  I often noticed, too, the quick glances&#xD;
that were interchanged between them, upon oc-&#xD;
casions, that seemed to have a subtle meaning&#xD;
to them that others could not see. All this, add-&#xD;
ed to the pleasure she undoubtedly took in his&#xD;
society, made me certain that her feelings were&#xD;
interested in him, even while her unvaried high&#xD;
spirits, the pleasure with which she received&#xD;
Mr. Nettleby's attentions, which he assiduously&#xD;
paid her upon every possible occasion, and the,&#xD;
to me, inexplicable fact that she was very apt to&#xD;
fall asleep when Eddie played or read to us, all&#xD;
told a very contradictory tale. I finally came&#xD;
to the conclusion, not a little sorrowfully, that&#xD;
Agnes, besides being incapable of very deep&#xD;
emotions, was also not a little tainted with the&#xD;
spirit of coquetry. Yet having full confidence&#xD;
in her innate purity and loving heart, I did not&#xD;
allow this discovery to grieve me much, feeling&#xD;
pretty sure that the match I was so bent upon&#xD;
making, would, ifuninterferedwith, finally come&#xD;
to a satisfactory termination.&#xD;
So Eddie brought his books to us day aftei&#xD;
day anti read, sometimes the charmed words oh&#xD;
time poets, sometimes thrilling 'scenes of trave&#xD;
andh adventure, his musical voice growing deel&#xD;
&#xD;
and eloquent with the emotions the subject&#xD;
excited. And when, laying down the book,&#xD;
he would allow himself to tell of the scenes he&#xD;
himself had passed through in the far-oil couna-&#xD;
tries of which he had been reading, and in lan-&#xD;
guage as elegant as forcible described to us as&#xD;
no books could do the noted places he had so&#xD;
lately visited, 1 would sit eager and excited as a&#xD;
child, leading him on with numberless pues-&#xD;
tions, never tired of listening, always heartily&#xD;
sorry when our converse was interrupted.  1&#xD;
could but-marvel to see the sublime indifference&#xD;
which Agnes maintained at such times, even&#xD;
when she kept awake, which she did not always&#xD;
do if her hands were not busily engaged.  She&#xD;
paid at all times vastly more attention to what&#xD;
was transpiring in the street, a view of which&#xD;
she conimmanded by sitting at the window, than&#xD;
to her young lover's most eloquent descriptions.&#xD;
Now she would interrupt the reading wit some&#xD;
frivolous questions about her sewing, or again&#xD;
upon subjects quite as unimptrtaut. whichi  r-&#xD;
haps were suggested to her fickle fancy liv the&#xD;
words to which she was preteutling to listen,&#xD;
and sometimes, even, she would desert ns en-&#xD;
tirely at the most interesting part of a poem&#xD;
or narrative, to run iout to chat with a neigh-&#xD;
bor, or shop for a skein of silk, and iieven to&#xD;
Eddie I could sometimes fancy that her ah-&#xD;
sence was almost a relief, for surely there is no&#xD;
greater bore under the sun thiainann ulllnterest-&#xD;
ed listener when one is reading aloud, even&#xD;
if such a listener chances to be a young and&#xD;
pretty woman.    Several times I had almost&#xD;
made up my mind to lecture Agnes about her&#xD;
giddiness, yet I refrained lest I shouldchance&#xD;
to work more harm than good to Eddie by my&#xD;
interference, for I know how delicate a thing it&#xD;
is to meddle in lovers' affairs, so I concluded&#xD;
it was wiser for inc to let Eddie take Agnes just&#xD;
as he found her, and cnre her himself of her&#xD;
foibles if he were able to do so.&#xD;
I became, as I have said, very much inter-&#xD;
ested in the young man, lie was the most&#xD;
highly educated person with whom I had ever&#xD;
I been associated, and the charm of knowledge&#xD;
was to me a new and overpowering one, so&#xD;
greedy had 1 always been to gain it, and so Ut-&#xD;
terly unattainable a treasure had it hitherto al-&#xD;
ways been. And now as the true extent of this&#xD;
young man's acquirements were gradually ini-&#xD;
veiled to me, in the close intercourse into&#xD;
which we were daily thrown, there was awak-&#xD;
r ened within me a profound respect which I&#xD;
made no attempt to conceal. lHe was miiuiout-&#xD;

&#xD;
self-taught, only added to the esteem and ad-!&#xD;
miration with which I regarded him.&#xD;
lie possessed a genius for the study of lan-&#xD;
guages which I suppose is very rarely found ;&#xD;
Greek and Latin, and even a smattering of He-&#xD;
brew he had attained as a school-boy, and his&#xD;
classical education had not been neglected, as is&#xD;
so often the case with professional men after&#xD;
they emerge from college and enter upon the&#xD;
duties of their career. He was an excellent&#xD;
German and French scholar, and was conver-&#xD;
sant more or less thoroughly with half a dozen&#xD;
other European languages, acquired during his&#xD;
travels. For all of which I had Frank Nettle-&#xD;
by's word, not considering my own judgment&#xD;
in such matters to be very reliable.&#xD;
lie (Frank) had a vast idea of Eddie's abil-&#xD;
ities, and had been the first to awaken my in-&#xD;
terest in the lad before I had learned to like&#xD;
him so thoroughly myself.&#xD;
" Ed is a flower born to blush unseen,' lie&#xD;
had said to me one day a week or so after the&#xD;
dinner of which I have just written. ''He has&#xD;
never been appreciated at home half as lie&#xD;
should have been. Miss Jenny, to be sure, con-&#xD;
siders him a very smart boy, almost worthy to&#xD;
be John's brother ; you, I presume, Mrs. iar-&#xD;
rington, entertain in a modified degree the&#xD;
same opinion; but as for Harrington, it was al-&#xD;
ways a marvel to me, how a man clear-sighted&#xD;
as he is, could be so blind to merits self-evident&#xD;
as are Ed's. lie never could be made to be-&#xD;
lieve him any thing extraordinary, though I&#xD;
have sounded his praises before him most dis-&#xD;
interestedly for the last five years back. All&#xD;
of which I suppose is owing to the fact that the&#xD;
prophet is in his own country.  It was vastly&#xD;
different when we were abroad, I assure you.&#xD;
Ed was a sought-after man wherever we went,&#xD;
and I really did not wonder at all, for when he&#xD;
chooses to make himself agreeable, a more en-&#xD;
tertaining or desirable acquaintance can seldom&#xD;
he met with.   his memory is marvelous, lie&#xD;
never forgets what lie learns, and he has an apt-&#xD;
itude for learning that is astonishing indeed to&#xD;
an empty-headed fellow like myself.  Culti-&#xD;
vate him, Mrs. Ilarrington, draw him out ; my&#xD;
word for it you will be well repaid for your&#xD;
trouble.'&#xD;
Inspired by Mr. Frank's eulogies as well as&#xD;
my own interest, I did try to draw Eddie out,&#xD;
and the result was, as 1 have stated, a wondrous&#xD;
surprise to myself, and a great change for the&#xD;
better in him.&#xD;
A new source of intimacy was soon evolved&#xD;
from our dlaily readings. Etddie had one day&#xD;
been reading to us his translation of a charming g&#xD;
&#xD;
little song of Bdranger's, a gem that even Ag-&#xD;
nes appreciated and listened to with delight.&#xD;
"Ah !" said he, regretfully, "if y3ou could&#xD;
but read it in the original ! my word' and ex-&#xD;
pressions seem so weak and meagre, wrten com-&#xD;
pared to the charming tones and phrases which&#xD;
Bdranger himself uses. I give you the outline,&#xD;
the vague idea of the gem, but its sot1l, its in-&#xD;
imitable sparkle, it seems to me the translation&#xD;
hides rather than reveals.  If you could but&#xD;
read Be'ranger in his own language !"&#xD;
" Ai! if we only could !" I sighed regret-&#xD;
fully; and Agnes cried eagerly, "Why can we&#xD;
not?  Will you not teach us, Eddie?  We all&#xD;
have plenty of time, and I think it would be de-&#xD;
lightful.  Caro is so clever, that she can learn&#xD;
almost without teaching, and with you and her&#xD;
both to help me, I am sure that even I could&#xD;
make rapid progress. Do teach us French, Ed-&#xD;
die, won't you ?"&#xD;
" Would you really like to learn ?" he cried&#xD;
eagerly, and he glanced quickly at me as if to&#xD;
find whether the proposition met with my ap-&#xD;
proval.  "Nothing would please me better&#xD;
than to become your teacher, and as you say,&#xD;
Agnes, we have plenty of time, that is of course&#xD;
if Caroline wishes to undertake the task."&#xD;
"It would be an imposition upon good-na-&#xD;
ture," I remonstrated, though my sparkling&#xD;
eyes belied the objections my tongue was rais-&#xD;
ing.  "A language can not be learned in a&#xD;
week or a month, and I fear, Eddie, thtt your&#xD;
patience would be exhausted long before your&#xD;
pupils were able to read Bdranger. I can not&#xD;
consent that you should undertake such a&#xD;
task."&#xD;
She is only going through the ceiemonv&#xD;
of that fine speech for form's sake, Eddie," cried&#xD;
Agnes. " I know that she is as anxious as I&#xD;
am that you should take us in hand. Pray don't&#xD;
mind her !"&#xD;
And Eddie added earnestly, "Indeed I am&#xD;
sincere in offering my services; if you will real-&#xD;
ly undertake the language, I shall find great&#xD;
pleasure in assisting you to the best of my abil-&#xD;
ity."&#xD;
And as I had no farther objection to raise,&#xD;
the arrangement was forthwith concluded ,and&#xD;
our French lessons became henceforth a daily&#xD;
institution.&#xD;
My butterfly Agnes, however, soon wearied&#xD;
of her self-imposed task. And after the ener-&#xD;
getic application which characterized her first&#xD;
week's study, she relapsed into her nsua idle&#xD;
ways; and though she would not, for very shame's&#xD;
sake, relinquish the study she had so eagerly&#xD;
commenced, she proved to be a very negligent&#xD;
&#xD;
scholar, allowing almost any trivial excuse to'&#xD;
serve her as a plea for missing her lesson. II&#xD;
fancied perhaps that Eddie would not have been&#xD;
&#xD;
to me is," he added, laughing, "that you ever&#xD;
could make up your mind to change it for one&#xD;
so insignificant as ours."&#xD;
"' What's in a name?'" I quoted theatrical-&#xD;
ly ; "'tis the substance I aim at, not the shadow.&#xD;
My ruling passion has found food on no such&#xD;
airy diet gs a mere name, the honorable charac-&#xD;
ter of the men and women who have borne it&#xD;
has been the nourishment upon which my pride&#xD;
has attained its present mighty growth. Imar-&#xD;
&#xD;
so willing to turn tutor, had he know how the&#xD;
matter would have terminated, but at all events&#xD;
he was too polite to let me see that I was to him&#xD;
a less interesting scholar than my pretty sister,&#xD;
and I was so industrious and eager a pupil that&#xD;
he could not help but take pleasure in aiding&#xD;
me in my labors.&#xD;
And thus the weeks and months slipped by,&#xD;
and the friendly intimacy between myself and&#xD;
my husband's young brother daily grew closer&#xD;
and more affectionate. It was about a month&#xD;
after the inauguration of the French class that&#xD;
the cloud began to-darken over my path.&#xD;
One day after a short lesson (Agnes was ab-&#xD;
sent, and my well-conned task seldom took&#xD;
much time to recite), Eddie and I had lapsed&#xD;
into conversation, as was frequently the case&#xD;
now that we had become such good friends,&#xD;
and by some means or other we had got to&#xD;
talking of ay father, of his struggles, sorrows,&#xD;
and triumphs. Eddie's appreciation of him was&#xD;
sufficiently entire to satisfy even my loving&#xD;
heart, and he had said-&#xD;
"I no longer wonder, Caroline. at the haugh-&#xD;
ty pride which is so pvc-eminently your charac-&#xD;
teristic. I suppose, now that we have grown to&#xD;
be good friends, that I may tell you how it at first&#xD;
appeared to me so repellent a feature in your dis-&#xD;
position. I recognized it, the very first evening&#xD;
I saw you, and then it made me almost dislike&#xD;
you. I could not understand it; I am so de-&#xD;
ficient in that respect myself, that I could not&#xD;
sympathize with such a spirit in another, espe-&#xD;
cially-" and lie hesitated, and blushed con-&#xD;
fusedly, as he glanced timidly at me.&#xD;
"Say on, Eddie," I cried, laughing at his em-&#xD;
barrassment, "you could not sympathise with&#xD;
pride, especially i'n one who had so little to be&#xD;
proud of; was not that what you meant to&#xD;
say ?"&#xD;
"And if it was, you can not take offense at&#xD;
it now, when I tell you how excusable I consider&#xD;
such a feeling in any one who can boast of such&#xD;
a father and such a name. The only marvel&#xD;
&#xD;
E&#xD;
&#xD;
eyes could read every expression of miy face.&#xD;
He had beautiful eyes, large and clearly cut ; in&#xD;
color grey, and in expression gentle and tender,&#xD;
almost melancholy, though there were not want-&#xD;
ing times when they were lighted up with a fire&#xD;
that betrayed the strong soul within. They&#xD;
were the only really fine feature in his face, for&#xD;
Eddie was by no means a handsome boy ; his&#xD;
skin was too sallow, his hair too light, his whole&#xD;
appearance too efleminate to deserve that so&#xD;

" Your happiness, do you say ? would you&#xD;
have me believe that your happiness is built&#xD;
upon your husband's honor, rather than his&#xD;
love ?"&#xD;
The question strikes deep, most learned&#xD;
lawyer, and I know not whether it is in my&#xD;
power to answer it. My husband's honor and&#xD;
my husband's love are so indissolubly mingled in&#xD;
my mind that I can not separate them, even in&#xD;
thought."&#xD;
"Let me see then if I can not propomund the&#xD;
question in a clearer form," lie said smilingly ;&#xD;
" I am not very well versedi hi matrimonial sta-&#xD;

"Jean only answer for myself,"I replied, ''and&#xD;

"Then suppose that from some circumstance&#xD;

from any of these causes your husband should&#xD;

with absolute repulsion ; think you that in los-&#xD;

Eddie's manner was half jesting, half earliest.&#xD;
but his voice was so kind and gentle that it was&#xD;
impossible to feel displeased at questions which&#xD;
from any one else I certainly should have re-&#xD;
sented ; to this, and to all the questions lie after-&#xD;

tion upon him.&#xD;
" Doubt! I doubt my husband! Eddie, are&#xD;
you losing your senses?"&#xD;
Ie caught my hand and clasped it passion-&#xD;
atelv between both his osvn.&#xD;
''I know you do not doubt him, Caroline, I&#xD;
do not want you to doubt him, and yet - )&#xD;
Heavens ! to see you so blind, so trustingly&#xD;
fond, and to oknow-but pshaw ! I am but mak-&#xD;
ing matters worse. My visionary life I believe&#xD;
lhas made me morbid, for really all that I wish&#xD;
to say is, that you must remember that John is&#xD;
but mortal. You are making him an idol, and&#xD;
in your worship willfully overlooking his hu-&#xD;
manity-a humanity that has its passions and&#xD;
its faults in common with yours and mine, and&#xD;
that sooner or later must stand in need of char-&#xD;
itable judgment, of loving forgiveness, as must&#xD;
our own. I tremble for the happiness of both&#xD;
of you if your haughty pride he not tutored into&#xD;
mercy before-before the day shall come upon&#xD;
which he shall need mercy."&#xD;
&#xD;
And gladly embracing the chance to termi&#xD;
nate the conversation, I heft them together and&#xD;
hastily quitted the room.&#xD;
CIIAPTER    X.&#xD;
JEALOUS JOHN IARRINGTON.&#xD;
ITvwas growing dark. I was too uneasy and&#xD;
nervous to settle myself to any employment, so&#xD;
I sauntered into the parlor and watched by&#xD;
the front window for John's arrival. I was n-&#xD;
comfortable, I could scarce tell why, fo' I&#xD;
would not allow even to myself that Eddie's&#xD;
disconnected words and strange maioieur had&#xD;
really awakened even the shadow of a suspicion&#xD;
against my husband in my mind, the thought&#xD;
was too absurd to be entertained, and I was&#xD;
ashamed of myself that what had pssed lie-&#xD;
tween us should have influenced my spirits as&#xD;
I could but feel it had done. Eddie was such&#xD;
an old, visionary sort of a boy, that he could&#xD;
work upon his own fancies and imaginations to&#xD;

G4                 MY HUSBAND'S CRIME.&#xD;
&#xD;
JEALOUS JOHN HARINGTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
an extent that would be ridiculous in any but a&#xD;
genius. And had his suppositions chanced to&#xD;
have referred to any one but my husband, they&#xD;
would have impressed me no more than he had&#xD;
intended they should. It was only my fanciful&#xD;
affection which made me so prone to exagger-&#xD;
ate every trifle in which John was concerned,&#xD;
and to believe that every one else magnified&#xD;
his virtues and perfections as I did myself.&#xD;
So I stood by the darkening window, gazing&#xD;
out into the autumn twilight, watching the hur-&#xD;
'ying wayfarers thronging past, and at last, in&#xD;
the obscurity, John's form loomed dimly up.&#xD;
Jenny and Frank Nettleby were with him,&#xD;
but I recognized my husband long before I was&#xD;
certain who were his companions. The 'tall,&#xD;
erect figure, broad shoulders, and quick, de-&#xD;
cided step, all were so familiar and so dear&#xD;
that it seemed to me were I never to see him&#xD;
again, and could yet live on, that after the&#xD;
lapse of half a century they would still be as&#xD;
vividly impressed upon my mind as they were&#xD;
to-day.&#xD;
Frank Nettleby was talking as they passed&#xD;
the window in his usual energetic fashion,&#xD;
though it seemed to me rather seriously for him,&#xD;
and I was sure that John's face, by the moment-&#xD;
ary glance I caught of it in the twilight, was&#xD;
cloudy and anxious-looking.  The party as-&#xD;
cended the front steps, and John opened thb-&#xD;
door for them himself with his night-key. At&#xD;
any other time I should have run to meet them,&#xD;
even if I had not opened the door, but to-night&#xD;
it seemed as if some irresistible influence was&#xD;
working within me, impelling me to thoughts,&#xD;
words, and actions of which I could not ex-&#xD;
plain the motives.&#xD;
So I stood by the window still, and heard'&#xD;
the steps going past the hoor through the long&#xD;
entry, and finally entering the sitting-room at&#xD;
the end of the passage, the room in which I&#xD;
had shortly since left Eddie and Agnes. The&#xD;
door closed behind them, and then 1 heard no&#xD;
more.&#xD;
I still stood gazing out into the street, think-&#xD;
ing odtd, disconnected thoughts, about Eddie,&#xD;
Agnes, Frank Nettleby, and the unknown pass-&#xD;
ers-ly, who were flitting like shadows past the&#xD;
window, not thinking of John at all, though&#xD;
his face and form were with me in the darkness&#xD;
almost sensibly.&#xD;
Preseutly I heard the sitting-room sdoer open&#xD;
and shut, and then a step in the entry which I&#xD;
knew was searching for ie.  The next mo-&#xD;
ment he stood at the door gazing into the shad-&#xD;
ows of the room.&#xD;
-"Are you here, Caroline ?'' he said.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes ; by the window;" and then he cross-&#xD;
ed the floor and stood by my side.&#xD;
" Any thing wrong, Caro ?" he asked, a&#xD;
vague uneasiness in his voice as he bent over&#xD;
me to see my face, as if to guess from it the&#xD;
cause of my strange demeanor.&#xD;
"No! I am only watching and thinking.&#xD;
"Watching whom? and thinking of what ?"&#xD;
"Watching the world go home to their sup-&#xD;
pers," said I, laughing at his suspicious curiosi-&#xD;
ty, "and wondering what they will have when&#xD;
they get there. Of nothing a bit mor~e roman-&#xD;
tic, I assure you. Did you suspect me of mus-&#xD;
ing upon a former lover ?'"'&#xD;
" Less probable things than that hake occur-&#xD;
red, I suppose, Caro, though I can not say I sus-&#xD;
pected you of such vanity, exactly. hadn't&#xD;
you better come to your own supper now? it is&#xD;
about ready, I believe. Frank Nettleby came&#xD;
home with me, and, apropos of former lovers,&#xD;
is, I suppose, of course anxious to see you. You&#xD;
were not dreaming about him, were yos ?".&#xD;
" No-yes-I believe he was in my mind&#xD;
along with a good many other people. Poor&#xD;
Frank !" and I sighed almost unconsciously, for&#xD;
I really had been thinking over the disappoint~&#xD;
ment which I felt sure his love for Agnes was&#xD;
preparing for him, and, much as I liked Eddie&#xD;
larrington, there was in my heart a warm af-&#xD;
feetion for my kind-hearted, honorable lover of&#xD;
olden times, that made inc loth to lave hin&#xD;
supplanted even by my new favorite.&#xD;
John had turned away from me rather ab-&#xD;
ruptly, I thought, and crossed to the open door.&#xD;
"Are you coming out now ?" he said coldly.&#xD;
" Of course I am,' I cried ; and springing&#xD;
across the room, I linked my arm in his as we&#xD;
traversed the entry.  " You are in a terrible&#xD;
hurry, though, I think. Are you so hugigry for&#xD;
your supper ? I have seen the time, Mr. Ilar-&#xD;
rington, when the prospect or a few ityinutes'&#xD;
tete- -tate with me was more alluring to you&#xD;
than the finest supper ever cooked."&#xD;
" Yes, but if I defer the tote-n-tate, I shall&#xD;
have that and, the supper too.  And the tate-&#xD;
d-tate will improve by waiting, while tie sup-&#xD;
per will not."&#xD;
"You are more discreet than gallant,'" I said&#xD;
half pettishly, as he threw open the sitting-&#xD;
room door, and then together we entered the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
" Ier  she is!" cried Frank Nettleby as&#xD;
soon as he saw me.   " You are just in time,&#xD;
Madame Caro, to be imeluded in a general iivi-&#xD;
tation which I have just extended to all friends&#xD;
here assembled to visit my bachelor amdnaee&#xD;
this evening, there to survey the amatefsr mu-&#xD;
&#xD;
scum I have collected, and afterward to honor&#xD;
me by partaking of a collation which I have or-&#xD;
dered to be prepared. I have really a pretty&#xD;
collection of coins and seals, and some mosa-&#xD;
ies that I believe can not be matched this side&#xD;
of the Atlantic. May I hope for the gracious&#xD;
company of Mr. and Mrs. Harrington ?"&#xD;
" Of course you may,"' I said, quite delight-&#xD;
ed at the prospect. "I am not much of an&#xD;
antiquary, so I will leave all anticipations of the&#xD;
museum to John and Jenny, who, I know, have&#xD;
strong tastes in that direction; as for me, I am&#xD;
free to confess,.my curiosity is much more&#xD;
strongly excited by the prospect of discovering&#xD;
what sort of a wilderness a bachelor's adnage&#xD;
may be. I am curious, indeed, to see how you&#xD;
look when you are at home, Mr. Frank, so I&#xD;
accept your invitation unconditionally, and so&#xD;
will John, I know."&#xD;
"Not quite so fast, Caroline, if you please ;&#xD;
be content with answering for yourself," said&#xD;
my husband. "I shall not be able to accom-&#xD;
pany you, for I have letters for the firm to&#xD;
write to-night which will occupy me until mid-&#xD;
night ; and they must be ready folr the morn-&#xD;
ing's mail."&#xD;
"Hang the firm !" cried Frank Nettleby ;&#xD;
"let business slide for to-night, Harrington, I&#xD;
beg of you. Upon my soul, it makes me feel&#xD;
guilty to look at you nowadays, for you go&#xD;
through all my business and your own, too. I&#xD;
dare be sworn now, those are the identical let-&#xD;
ters I promised our partner to write this morn-&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
"The identical ones," said John dryly.&#xD;
"Well, now, I'll tell you what I'll do: do you&#xD;
come along with us to-night, and enjoy your-&#xD;
self as a Christian should, and I will get up&#xD;
early to-morrow morning, and go to the store&#xD;
soor enough to get through a whole mail-bag&#xD;
full of correspondence beforenine o'clock. Will&#xD;
that do ?"&#xD;
"No, sir !" answered John shortly; "even&#xD;
supposing you do not oversleep yourself, or for-&#xD;
get the 'whole affair entirely, which is by no&#xD;
means an improbable circumstance, there are&#xD;
more than you would be able to write in so&#xD;
limited a time."&#xD;
"Don't you believe that! I can get through&#xD;
more work in an hour, when I set my mind to&#xD;
it, than any fellow of my weight in the city."&#xD;
"That you can, Mr. Frank !" I cried, laugh-&#xD;
ing. "I remember when you used to help me&#xD;
with my work when I was in the store; you&#xD;
used often to astonish me by the rapidity of&#xD;
your progress."&#xD;
'"You hax'e not forgotten those days, then,&#xD;
&#xD;
Madam Caro?"and Mr. Frank laughed, too. "'I&#xD;
do not remember much about the work 1 did,&#xD;
though ; it seems to me I spent far more time&#xD;
looking at you, than in any less interesting em-&#xD;
ployment.  You used to work, though, to some&#xD;
purpose. Shade of Hercules! xw'hat an indefhti-&#xD;
gable little creature you were ; it used to require&#xD;
the greatest display of brilliancy otn my part,&#xD;
and not a little diplomatic manouvring, to&#xD;
make you raise your eyes from your work - and&#xD;
to win from you a smile, I was obliged to display&#xD;
the combined talents of a Machiavelli and a&#xD;
Ilood. I have that precious blank book yet,&#xD;
laid carefully away as a souvenir of those 1Een-&#xD;
orable days."&#xD;
I was foolish enough to color quite highly at&#xD;
this light speech, more, 1 think, because Agnes's&#xD;
eyes were turned inquiringly upon me than&#xD;
from any other reason, and Frank himself look-&#xD;
edh a little foolish, as he ceased speaking, and&#xD;
saw my crimson face.&#xD;
There was an awkward pause for a moment,&#xD;
which John broke by saying-&#xD;
" Supper was announced some time since&#xD;
Caroline; had we not better obey the sum-&#xD;
mons ?'&#xD;
''You'll go, Ilarrington, wont you ?" sail&#xD;
Frank, s we took our seats at table.&#xD;
Certainly not '" answered he, a great deal&#xD;
more harshly than 1 thought warrantable by&#xD;
the occasion. ''I promised your father when&#xD;
I left the store that the letters should ie writ-&#xD;
ten this evening, and it shall be no fault of&#xD;
mine if the promise is not performed."&#xD;
" Well, if you won't you won't, and there's&#xD;
the end on't," said unimpressiounble Frank, and&#xD;
thent straightway commenced talking about&#xD;
other matters, and nothing farther was sabd&#xD;
about the proposed visit.&#xD;
After supper the whole company adjourned to&#xD;
the parlor with the exception of John, who be-&#xD;
took himself with a brief apology to the silence&#xD;
and solitude of the sitting-room, for the pur-&#xD;
pose of proceeding with his letters in peace.&#xD;
Our supper had been late, however, and rest-&#xD;
less Frank allowed but a short interval to&#xD;
elapse before he was teasing us to start.&#xD;
" Suppose it is early !" he cried, ii answer to&#xD;
Agnes's expostulation; "you have no fornial&#xD;
hostess to meet there to rebuke your appearance&#xD;
with an incompleted toilet and an- unlighted&#xD;
room. I have a capital valet whom I imported&#xD;
from France five years ago, expressly for my own&#xD;

Then with a strange eager look in his eyes, he confused.&#xD;
took my face between his hands and gazed       " I would not tell you for a kiingdom," he&#xD;
down uspon me.                              cried impulsively.&#xD;

as if to push me from his knee.   Oh ! how     " I wonder what you would have been, hind I&#xD;

&#xD;
"If I answer at all, it will be candidly," he&#xD;
said gently ; and then I dashed boldly on.&#xD;
"Have you ever kept from me any secret con-&#xD;
cerning yourself, the knowledge of which might&#xD;
affect my love for you ?"&#xD;
I gazed eagerly into his eyes, and they never&#xD;
blenched from mine, but every particle of color&#xD;
deserted his face until even his lips were white.&#xD;
It was some moments ere he spoke, and when he&#xD;
did so it was with visible effort.&#xD;
" I should be the most miserable man on God's&#xD;
earth if I thought so," he said slowly.&#xD;
I threw myself into his arms, laughing hyster-&#xD;
ically.&#xD;
That is all then ; I will have all faith in&#xD;
you now, and from this moment my dream shall&#xD;
be forgotten! He caressed me gently for a few&#xD;
moments and then released me.&#xD;
" Our tute-(-t~e is making me neglect my&#xD;
work, after all," he said. '" It will be mid-&#xD;
night yet before I get through, if I do not start&#xD;
pretty soon."&#xD;
So then he returned to his table and his writ-&#xD;
ing, looking up at me as I stood watching'&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Hadn't you better go to bed?  I shall be&#xD;
several hours occupiied."&#xD;
"No, I will wait here until you get through ;&#xD;
I dont want to go to bed yet, but it is too late to&#xD;
get out my sewing." So I curled myself up&#xD;
upon a lounge which stood opposite the table,&#xD;
and lay where I could see his thee and watch&#xD;
him as he worked.&#xD;
lie said no more, but wrote on industriously,&#xD;
at times casting an affectionate glance upon me,&#xD;
as I lay comfortably tranquil before him.&#xD;
After a while he arose, and took down his&#xD;
coat which hung behind the door; coming to me,&#xD;
he threw it carefully over my shoulders.&#xD;
You will fall asletip here, and take cold, 1&#xD;
am afraid ; had you not better go to bed ?"&#xD;
"No, I will wait for you," I murmured,&#xD;
drowsily.&#xD;
He stood looking at me a moment, and then,&#xD;
suddenly bending down, he pressed his lips to&#xD;
mine, and before I was wide enough awake to&#xD;
return his caress, he had returned to the table&#xD;
and his work.&#xD;
Ahr! could I but have looked forward into the&#xD;
future, and known then all that would intervene,&#xD;
ere again my husband's kiss should be upon my&#xD;
lips, how different would have been the emo-&#xD;
tions his act had excited. But I was blind;&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
BASE COINAGE OF A SUSPICIOUS BRAIN.&#xD;
Tm next morning at the breakfast-table, Ed-&#xD;
die and Jenny united their powers of descrip-&#xD;
tion to convince me of what I had missed by not&#xD;
accepting the invitation I had received upon the&#xD;
previous evening. Eddie was particularly en-&#xD;
thusiastic, which astonished me the more, as I&#xD;
knew this was by no means the first time he had&#xD;
examined and admired Frank Nettleby's collec-&#xD;
tion of home and foreign curiosities.&#xD;
I said as much to him, and be answered, "It&#xD;
is true; I have frequently seen, while we were'&#xD;
abroad, almost all the articles he has collected&#xD;
together; indeed many of them I begged, bor-&#xD;
rowed, bought or stole for him, myself; he is&#xD;
indebted to me for more than half of his foreign.&#xD;
autographs, for as he speaks no foreign language&#xD;
but French, he could do very little begging on&#xD;
his own account. But somehow, I never tire of&#xD;
examining these mementoes of the past, and ev-&#xD;
ery time I go over them, I discover something I&#xD;
had overlooked before.  John, I am astonished&#xD;
that you never have had curiosity enough to visit&#xD;
Nettleby's rooms to examine his collection ;&#xD;
there may be larger, but I really doubt if there&#xD;
be a more unique private museum in the city."&#xD;
"Caroline and I are going shortly to spend&#xD;
ar evening with him, and then we can view&#xD;
these treasures at our leisure."&#xD;
"Eddie, what were those pictures I admired&#xD;
so? the works of Mercy, you know ; there were&#xD;
eight of them," questioned Jenny.&#xD;
"Copies from Murillo, taken in the Hospital&#xD;
de la Caridad of Seville," answered hei brother&#xD;
briefly.&#xD;
"Yes, that was it.  Caroline, my dear, when&#xD;
you go, you must take a good look at them; I/&#xD;
saw nothing I liked as well in the whole collec-&#xD;
tion ; I want you to notice particularly a female&#xD;
head in the one which hans nearest the window ;&#xD;
it is an exquisite face, and both Frank and I&#xD;
fancied we could trace in it a strong resem-&#xD;
blance to our Agnes."&#xD;
"I thanked you last night for the implied&#xD;
compliment," said my sister, laughing  and&#xD;
blushing, "so I will not do so now ; but in-&#xD;
deed I scarcely acknowledge any compliment,&#xD;
either, for I could not trace the least possible&#xD;
resemblance to myself, for all Mr. Nettleby&#xD;
was so determined that I should. For my part,&#xD;
I thought the museum was the dullest part of&#xD;
&#xD;
and the long memorable evening, the last of my the entertainment.  I never had any tast4 for&#xD;
happy dream of wedded bliss, glided on after its such things, anyhow.  But, 0 Caroline ! we&#xD;
predecessors into the ocean of eternity; and then had the most exquisite petite souper (is that&#xD;
came the morrow!                           pronounced right, Eddie?) ever I sat dowdl to&#xD;
&#xD;
Every thing was in such excellent taste ; and&#xD;
that French fellow who waited on us-Andre,&#xD;
Mr. Nettleby called him-he is a perfect jewel&#xD;
of a servant ; so quick and intelligent, really&#xD;
gentlemanly, I declare. We never have any&#xD;
such in our country. It reminded me alto-&#xD;
gether of the tales of English high life of which&#xD;
we read. The flowers, and perfumery, and&#xD;
dainty vittnds, and the French waiter ; they&#xD;
were all so delightfully romantic. I was so&#xD;
sorry you weie not with us."&#xD;
"Yes !" sighed Miss Jenny regretfully, "the&#xD;
supper was nice. And that reminds me, Car-&#xD;
oline, Frank said that he was going to send you&#xD;
a basket of fruit this morning. lie had such&#xD;
an abundant supply of every thing. You re-&#xD;
member, Agnes, there was a large vase of those&#xD;
lovely white grapes, and very few were eaten."&#xD;
"I was rather astonished to notice how defi-&#xD;
cient his collection of modern coins is," Eddie&#xD;
Ilarrington was saying, when next I caught his&#xD;
voice.  "His ancient specimens are pretty&#xD;
complete'; the Greek coins especially, but he&#xD;
seems to have taken no pains whatever to per-&#xD;
fect his collection of European specimens. He&#xD;
has one piece I should like you to see, John ;&#xD;
an English quarter-florin struck in the reign of&#xD;
Edward III. ; undoubtedly genuine. Perhaps&#xD;
you do not know that they are exceedingly&#xD;
scarce. George Emerson wrote to me, when I&#xD;
was in London last year, to get him one at any&#xD;
price, but I could not do it. I did not know&#xD;
that Nettleby had one until last night. He&#xD;
catme across his, quite accidentally he said, in&#xD;
Paris ; purchased it from a Jew pawnbroker&#xD;
fo 'a mere trifle. By the bye, you used to have&#xD;
qute a collection of coins yourself, what have&#xD;
yok done with them ?"&#xD;
" They are in one of the inner drawers of&#xD;
the secretary, I believe," answered John. "I&#xD;
have not looked at them for years. I have long&#xD;
agu outgrown my fancy for numismatics ; still,&#xD;
I should like to see what Nettleby has gathered&#xD;
together."&#xD;
"I suppose you have no objection to my&#xD;
overhauling yours ?" queried Eddie.&#xD;
"Certainly not ; Caroline has the key of the&#xD;
secretary, she will give it to you whenever you&#xD;
want it."&#xD;
And accordingly, that afternoon, when the&#xD;
French lesson was concluded, Eddie called upon&#xD;
me for the promised key, and busied himself&#xD;
diligently in bringing to light a parcel of black&#xD;
and time-stained medals and coins, which'had&#xD;
been stowed away in the drawer of the secreta-&#xD;
ry ever since we had been at housekeeping-.&#xD;
I was amused to see the interest which the&#xD;
&#xD;
boy seemed to take in his new discovery.&#xD;
With a box of whiting, an old-tooth-brush, and&#xD;
a vial of some kind of acid, he scrubbed und&#xD;
polished until he really made some of the' old&#xD;
things assume quite a respectable appearance.&#xD;
I watched him for a while, as he unfolded the&#xD;
papers, in which some of the more valuable&#xD;
coins were wrapl)ed, and did my best to sym-&#xD;
pathize with the excitement he seemed to feel&#xD;
when one dirtier or uglier than the others made&#xD;
its appearance; but I soon got tired of the new&#xD;
pursuit, and sat down with my sewing at the&#xD;
other side of the'room. Agnes watched a while&#xD;
longer, but she too soon lost interest in the&#xD;
amusement, and finally sauntered out of the&#xD;
room, leaving Eddie to pursue uninterruptedly&#xD;
his occupation. lie would frequently call my&#xD;
attention to some new discovery, which he fan-&#xD;
cied to be particularly noticeable, and at last&#xD;
he jumped up, and coming over to me, threw in&#xD;
my lap a coin wrapped carefully in paper.&#xD;
"'Take charge of this for me, if you please,"&#xD;
said he; ''it is a Roman medallion, struck by&#xD;
Hadrian. I heard Frank Nettleby last night&#xD;
wishing lie could obtain one. John seems to&#xD;
place very little value on his, so I will ask him&#xD;
to-night, when lie comes home, to give this to&#xD;
Nettleby," and then lie went industriously to&#xD;
work again, brushing a large bronze coin, whose&#xD;
inscription lie seemed to find it impossible to&#xD;
decipher.&#xD;
I unfolded the parcel lie had given to me,&#xD;
and glanced carelessly at the piece of silver (I&#xD;
believe it was) which was within. I saw noth-&#xD;
ing more remarkable in it than I had seen in&#xD;
any of the other specimens, so I proceeded to&#xD;
refold it in the paper from which I had taken&#xD;
ilt. This paper seemed to be the yellow nd&#xD;
discolored fragment of a letter, and as I took&#xD;
it up, my eye fell upon a few words written iii&#xD;
it, which made me involuntarily pause and&#xD;
smooth out the paper to examine it more fully.&#xD;
" Casey &amp;amp; Co." were the words which had&#xD;
attracted my attention, and the reader may re-&#xD;
member, as I did instantaneously, that this was&#xD;
the name of the firm in which Frank Nettleby's&#xD;
eccentric friend S    had declared my hus-&#xD;
band had been employed; an assertion which&#xD;
John had, with visible agitation, positively de-&#xD;
nied to be true. Remembering these facts, and&#xD;
the conversation which had introduced them,&#xD;
my feelings may perhaps be better imagined&#xD;
than described, when upon turning to the top&#xD;
of the letter, I read the following lines&#xD;
"DEAn HARlriNGTrON :-Your letter of the 201th inst. is&#xD;

they will always obtain the preference over a fellow so&#xD;

to get along with; btt John P. Casey is a good titan,&#xD;
stanch and genuine, and if its seems inclined to befriend&#xD;
you, as you cay he does, 1-"&#xD;
That was all there was. The rest of the paper,&#xD;
including the signature, was torn away ; but&#xD;
what I had read was enough-enough to con-&#xD;
vince mae, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that&#xD;
my husband had lied; that whether the horri-&#xD;
ble story hinted at by 8-- were true or false,&#xD;
the one black, inexcusable falsehood was there&#xD;
before me, and could never be forgotten or ex-&#xD;
plained away. I turned to look at the date of&#xD;
the letter ; it was eleven years back, just one&#xD;
year before John ihad entered the firm of Net-&#xD;
tleby &amp;amp; Son.&#xD;
I gazed upon the fatal paper until my head&#xD;
swam, and I felt sick and faint.&#xD;
" What is the tuttter, Caroline ? has your&#xD;
needle scratched you ?" asked Eddie, who had&#xD;
just then turned towardti me, and noticed my&#xD;
white face, as I sat with the tell-tale letter&#xD;
clenched in my hand.&#xD;
" No-Yes-I have hurt myself somehow,"&#xD;
I managed to falter out, and quite unable to&#xD;
give a more connected reply, unmindful of his&#xD;
anxious inquiries, I rose and left the room.&#xD;
Ilurrying to my own chamber, I turned the&#xD;
key in the lock, and paced the floor distracted-&#xD;
ly.  Had the news been suddenly brought to&#xD;
me that John had asset with some fearful acci-&#xD;
dent, endangering life or limb, my feelings&#xD;
could not have been more acutely painful than&#xD;
were they now.    My faith in him had been so&#xD;
perfect, my reliance upon0 his integrity so entire,&#xD;
that a blow aimed at his honor reacted with tor-&#xD;
turing force upon my heart.     The truth was&#xD;
too horrible. In desperate self-tlefense I strove&#xD;
to argue it away, to reason     against reason.&#xD;
Forget it I could not ; my too faithful memo-&#xD;
ry cruelly brought forward every suspicious act&#xD;
and word that had reference to the mysterious&#xD;
event that was destined to destroy my happi-&#xD;
ness.  A  maddening curiosity urged mte on to&#xD;
find out all that had been hidden from me, to&#xD;
discover the motives which had prompted that&#xD;
dark falsehood, the sin and shatne which were&#xD;
&#xD;
gagement, when John had put my affection for&#xD;
him to so strange a test, by asking me if my love&#xD;
could fail him were I to discover that his name&#xD;
had been irremediably stained by some dishon-&#xD;
orable deed. Well did I remember the earnest-&#xD;
ness with which the seemingly unimuportatit&#xD;
question had been asked. To be sure he lied&#xD;
afterward assured me that his question was a&#xD;
foundationless one ; but then, I thought with&#xD;
bitter agony, he could lie now, was he likely to&#xD;
have been more truthful then ? And then my&#xD;
mind reverted to Frank Nettleby's strange tale,&#xD;
and the question which had forced from my hus-&#xD;
band the reply which my to-day's discovery proved&#xD;
to be false. There could have been no motive&#xD;
for falsehood, either in Frank or his strange in-&#xD;
formant S    . Had the old man then really&#xD;
made no mistake in his narration? had the&#xD;
dark deeds of guilt which he imputed to John&#xD;
Harrington been really imputed to the true&#xD;
criminal?  Yet no ! no ! Dark as was every&#xD;
thing before me, I could not go to the extreme&#xD;
length of believing this. Accurate as were the&#xD;
old man's statements, terribly convincing as was&#xD;
the evidence against him in John's emotion&#xD;
when hearing the story, I would not believe&#xD;
that in the truth of the accusation lay the solu-&#xD;
tion of the mystery. The lie was bad enough,&#xD;
but if behind that lay still concealed some dark,&#xD;
dishonorable secret, I could not hear it ; I must&#xD;
surely lose my senses, or die of shame and grief.&#xD;
Was there no way to exonerate him?  o pos-&#xD;
sible solution to the enigma save through chan-&#xD;
nels of darker disgrace?  Could I by 105pos-&#xD;
sibility throw doubt or discredit upon the letter&#xD;
I had that day discovered?  Was such poor,&#xD;
puny evidence as that 4o crush forever my be-&#xD;
lief in my husband's integrity?  At least let&#xD;
me suspend my decision until my mind should&#xD;
be in a calmer state, if that time could ever&#xD;
again arrive, and until I should be able td think&#xD;
less distractedly of the events which were threat-&#xD;
ening to overwhelm me. If I could but sleep,&#xD;
forget all, if only for a few short hours, I fan-&#xD;
cied I should be able to see some gleam of light&#xD;
in a less agitated mood, which still might dissi-&#xD;
pate the shadows that were gathering so threat-&#xD;
eningly around mue.&#xD;
So I threw myself upon the bed, sliut my&#xD;
eyes. clasped my hands over my ears, and en-&#xD;
deavored with all my power to shut out thought.&#xD;
The miserable hours sped away. Night came,&#xD;
and I heard the tea-bell sounding below. Then&#xD;
presently the light step of Agnes sounded in the&#xD;
&#xD;
hidden behind it.                        f passage outside of my door, and after trying&#xD;
Far back into the past my memory ran, to vainly to open it, she tapped lightly upon the&#xD;

LASE COINAGE OF A SUSPICIOUS BRAIN.&#xD;

"Supper's ready, Caro," she cried, "we are&#xD;
all waiting for you."&#xD;
Raising myself upon my elbow, I spoke in as&#xD;
natural a voice as I could command, -&#xD;
"Tell them to eat without me ; I have gone&#xD;
to bed with a sick headache."&#xD;
"Mercy on me! why did you not tell some of&#xD;
us?  I may bring you up a cup of tea, mayn't&#xD;
I?"&#xD;
"No ! No !" and my impatient misery would&#xD;
manifest itself in my voice; "I want nothing&#xD;
but rest and quiet ; do leave me to myself."&#xD;
So she went away, and I was left in quiet.&#xD;
Alas ! was I ever to know rest again?  I knew&#xD;
that John would come to me soon, so I rose and&#xD;
unlocked the door, for I wished to avoid any con-&#xD;
versation with him ; then, undressing hastily, I&#xD;
crept into bed again, with my miserable thoughts,&#xD;
that would not be banished for all my striving,&#xD;
goading me almost to madness.&#xD;
lie came soon ; stepping lightly, and opening&#xD;
the door cautiously that he might not disturb me,&#xD;
he- came to my bedside in the darkness and laid&#xD;
his hand softly upon my brow.&#xD;
"Asleep, Caroline?" he asked gently. I&#xD;
made no answer, and after a moment's pause,&#xD;
evidently convinced that' I was really slum-&#xD;
bering, he silently withdrew, and again I- was&#xD;
alone.&#xD;
An hour later he came again to the door,&#xD;
which he opened noiselessly, and stood listening&#xD;
upon the threshold, but judging from the pro-&#xD;
found silence within the room that I still slept,&#xD;
he returned without speaking.&#xD;
At an hour rather earlier than usual, I heard&#xD;
the family retiring for the night.  Some of the&#xD;
ascending steps paused at my door, and my ear,&#xD;
preternaturally acute from the deal silence&#xD;
which had reigned around me, distinguished&#xD;
Jenny's voice saying-.&#xD;
" Wait a moment, Agnes, I will go in and see&#xD;
how Caroline is."&#xD;
And then John's voice answered-&#xD;
''You had better not ; it will only disturb her,&#xD;
and she was sleeping quietly when I was up here&#xD;
an hour since."&#xD;
So then the others passed on, and John en-&#xD;
tered the room alone. lie carried a lamp in&#xD;
his hand as he approached the bedside this time,&#xD;
and I did not dare feign sleep again, but with a&#xD;
little sharp cry, I turned my head away and put&#xD;
my hand over my face.&#xD;
"What is the matter, Caro? are you suffer-&#xD;
ing ?"&#xD;
" Yes !" I cried, and oh ! how truly, for&#xD;
&#xD;
"Can not I do something for you, my dar-&#xD;
ling ?"&#xD;
Then I could bear it no longer.&#xD;
" Take that light away, it hurts me ; aud&#xD;
please don't make me talk."&#xD;
He stood watching me uneasily for a mo-&#xD;
ment or two, evidently doubtful whether to&#xD;
question me farther or not, but he was not by&#xD;
nature either fussy or demonstrative, so finally&#xD;
he turned quietly away, saying no more to me,&#xD;
though his putting out the light almost instant-&#xD;
ly, and his cautious, quiet movements as he&#xD;
undressed in the darkened room, testiiel to his&#xD;
sympathy for my sufferings.  IIe spoke no&#xD;
word to me, even after he lay down by my&#xD;
side, except to ask if I were warm enough, for&#xD;
it was late in October, and the night was chilly&#xD;
and stormy ; though I had not noticed either&#xD;
cold or storm before. A brief ailirmative was&#xD;
all the response I gave, and then silence and&#xD;
darkness again reigned around me.&#xD;
Soon by his deep, regular breathing I knew&#xD;
that John was asleep, but still I lay, sleepless,&#xD;
suffering, longing for yet dreading the day, and&#xD;
the night was far advanced ere worn-out na-&#xD;
ture at last conquered my misery, and I fell&#xD;
into a heavy dreamless slumber from which I&#xD;
did not awaken until quite late the following&#xD;
morning.&#xD;
To my great relief, I found that John had al-&#xD;
ready arisen and gone down stairs, but know-&#xD;
ing that lie would surely return to me before he&#xD;
left for the store, if I had not descended, and&#xD;
-thinking that it would be harder for me to meet&#xD;
him alone than in the presence of others, I&#xD;
&#xD;
arose, dressed hastily, and went down stairs.&#xD;
The family were seated at the breakfast-ta-&#xD;
ble when I entered the room, and John said,&#xD;
when I had replied to the many kind inquiries&#xD;
concerning my headache, which greeted my&#xD;
appearance, "You were sleeping so soundly&#xD;
when I left you, that I would not disturb you.&#xD;
You must keep quiet to-day, or you may have&#xD;
a return of your trouble to-night. What (do&#xD;
you think brought it upon you ?"&#xD;
"The prick of a needle, I guess," said Eddie&#xD;
laughingly, "for until that misadventure oc-&#xD;
curred yesterday afternoon she seemed well&#xD;
and cheerful as usual. I thought at first, Caro-&#xD;
line, when you left me so abruptly, that some-&#xD;
thing I had said or done must have offended&#xD;
you, or else that the coin which I gave you to&#xD;
keep for me had proved to be  bewitched one,&#xD;
and had acted     1 yo     some malignant&#xD;
manner. Nay, you need not look for it," he&#xD;
&#xD;
every tone of that gentle, loving voice struck continued, as almost involuntarily I turned to&#xD;
agony to my heart.                         glance at the work - basket wherein I had&#xD;

'Yes," lie replied.  " I have some business then he left me, and I turned to John, jyio was&#xD;

vid than the occasion apparently called for,  lie hung his head, and seemed to be in a&#xD;

&#xD;
after a moment's hesitation raised to his lips. I&#xD;
drew it gently away.&#xD;
" Nay, my lear boy," I continued, with a&#xD;
faint smile, ''I did not intend to arouse your&#xD;
chivalrous nature to such a pitch of enthusiasm&#xD;
as this ; my troubles are commonplace enough,&#xD;
and all the aid I ask from you is a truthful re-&#xD;

lie was calm enough now, and seemed quite&#xD;
anhamed of his previous gallantry.&#xD;
"iely upon me, Caroline," he said in a tone&#xD;
of quiet gravity.  "As far as help of mine can&#xD;
benefit you, I am at your service now and&#xD;
ever," and then he waited for me to speak.&#xD;
But now that the time and opportunity had&#xD;
arrived, I found far more difficulty in man-&#xD;
aging the matter than I 1ad anticipated.  I&#xD;
felt an unutterable repugnance to mentioning&#xD;
John's name. I feared, if I did so, that I&#xD;
should lose all the self-control which thus far,&#xD;
by desperate effort, I had preserved ; and then,&#xD;
too, I was ignorant of the extent of Eddie's ac-&#xD;
quaintance with the dark business I was striv-&#xD;
ing to unveil, and above all things I dreaded&#xD;
allowing him to make any discovery of it&#xD;
through me. So I hesitated for some tine ere&#xD;

First," I continued gently, ''I want you to&#xD;
understand that I have discovered that the de-&#xD;
nial which your brother gave to Mr. Nettleby&#xD;
was untrue.  I know this."V&#xD;
" I)on't judge him harshly, Caroline," plead-&#xD;
ed Eddie ;''you don't know how terrible was&#xD;
the temptation which forced that falsehood&#xD;
from his lips. John is a truthful nan, of late&#xD;
years a remarkably truthful man. Do not let&#xD;
that one dark error overshadow in your mind&#xD;
his otherwise unimpeachable veracity."&#xD;
I laughed, a hard, bitter laugh, wrung from&#xD;
my wretchedness by pitiless scorn.&#xD;
"Do not make yourself uneasy ; your broth-&#xD;
er will fare well if he never meets with a&#xD;
harsher judge than his wife will prove to be.&#xD;
You admit the fact, then, and confirm the story&#xD;
I have already heard, that eleven years ago he&#xD;
was in the employ of Casey &amp;amp; Co. In what&#xD;
capacity, may I ask ?"&#xD;
"Fourth' or fifth clerk, or something like&#xD;
that ; he was the lowest in the office," was the&#xD;
rather sullen reply.&#xD;
" Why did lie leave the fixm ?" I asked, and&#xD;
then I turned sick and white as I waited for the&#xD;
answer._&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DREADED TRUTH UNFOLDED.          75&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
Ecddie turned and fixed his eyes steadily'&#xD;
upon mine, as he replied coldly-&#xD;
"Do yosask this question, also, that my&#xD;
words may confirm some story against him&#xD;
which you have already heard ?"&#xD;
"I have heard no story whatever either for&#xD;
or against him, and I ask you the question be-&#xD;
cause you are the only one in the family who&#xD;
can tell me the truth, and the truth I must&#xD;
know at any cost."&#xD;
He rose from his chair.&#xD;
"Mrs. Harrington," he said, with simple&#xD;
dignity, "it strikes me that we are interfering&#xD;
most unwarrantably with John's affairs; I shall&#xD;
say no more. If you wish to learn the particu-&#xD;
lars of that part of his life, you must refer to&#xD;
him to discover them. For my part, I must de-&#xD;
cline all farther interference."&#xD;
And as he finished speaking he moved to-&#xD;
ward the door. his voice was so stern, his&#xD;
manner so haughty, that I could hardly recog-&#xD;
nize in him the quiet, timid youth I had hither-&#xD;
to known. I might have been awed by his&#xD;
manner and shamed into silence, had not my&#xD;
feelings by this time become quite uncontrolla-&#xD;
ble ; the end must come now, for I could bear&#xD;
no more. I respected the young man's ionora-&#xD;
ble feelings, but I was none the less deter-&#xD;
mined to wrest from him the secret which I&#xD;
now was certain he held.   I sprang forward&#xD;
and caught him by the arm.&#xD;
"Stop! Eddie, you must not leave me thus.&#xD;
The question has been asked and it must be an-&#xD;
swered; all that yon say, all that you feel re-&#xD;
specting the impropriety of my conduct, I too&#xD;
have felt; judge then how powerful must be the&#xD;
motives which impel me to persist in my course&#xD;
spite of my own self-reproach, spite of your con-&#xD;
tempt. It is of vital importance to me that I&#xD;
s,     should be made acquainted with this dark&#xD;
secret, and if you refuse me the information I&#xD;
desire, I must seek it from strangers."&#xD;
"Are you mad ?" he cried with agitation.&#xD;
"No! I am not mad, but I shall soon become&#xD;
so, if this strain upon my heart and mind is al-&#xD;
lowed to continue. I can never rest until I&#xD;
know all, and if no other source of discovery is&#xD;
allowed me, I shall learn from Frank Nettleby&#xD;
the address of that man S-, of whom he was&#xD;
telling us, and from him discover all that has&#xD;
been so wickedly concealed from me. I will do&#xD;
this, I tell you, if you still refuse to answer me;&#xD;
but you will not refuse, dearest Eddie, whom&#xD;
I have learned to love as a brother; whose&#xD;
kindness and affection I have turned to almost&#xD;
instinctively in this my hour of shame and&#xD;
misery. When you know how essential-it is to&#xD;
&#xD;
ness and peace ?" I said despairingly.&#xD;
Ie cname to me, and caught my hands passion-&#xD;
ately in his grasp.&#xD;
''You tempt me; you tempt me fearfully,&#xD;
he said.&#xD;
I gazed mutely, piteously into his face, but&#xD;
made no farther attempt to persuade him.&#xD;
" If I tell you," he said, still grasping my&#xD;
hands, still gazing at me with an expression I&#xD;
strove in vain to comprehend---" If I tell you,&#xD;
will you promise me faithfully to conceal your&#xD;
knowledge from John ?"&#xD;
" How can I '?" I said. "Iis talent as an&#xD;
actor has been denied to me.    'Thiough my&#xD;
tongue should maintain silence, my voice, mx&#xD;
manner, my very glance must show the change&#xD;
that has been wrought in my feelings."&#xD;
"Time will modify that; in a few days, when&#xD;
the first effects of this revelation have worn&#xD;
away, events will glide in their usual channel,&#xD;
and you will soon be as you have hitherto been.&#xD;
If John were to know that you are acquainted&#xD;
with his disgrace, his own shame and distress&#xD;
would'widen the breach between you, and per-&#xD;
haps destroy irrevocably your chance of future&#xD;
happiness. If that knowledge can  e concealed&#xD;
from him, I do not know but that it would be&#xD;
really doing a kindness both to you and to him,&#xD;
to tell you the truth now. As you say, your&#xD;
imagination may make the reality eves worse&#xD;
than it is, and the truth I verily believe will in-&#xD;
fluence you less than the suspicions and fears&#xD;
which now you entertain."&#xD;
&#xD;
F1&#xD;
&#xD;
my happiness, to my very reason, that this mys-&#xD;
tery should be elucidated, T know you will no&#xD;
longer refuse to my prayers and tears the infor-&#xD;
mation for which I am seeking."&#xD;
He tore himself from my eager grasp, and&#xD;
paced the floor distractedly.&#xD;
" You know not what you ask !" lie said.&#xD;
"Have you reflected that there may he shame,&#xD;

76                  MY HUSBAND'S CRIME.&#xD;
&#xD;
" You are right, Eddie," I cried eagerly,&#xD;
" you are right, indeed ; it will be no act of&#xD;
kindness to him to conceal from inc now the&#xD;
whole truth. As I have told you, discover it&#xD;
finally I must and will ; and surely it were&#xD;
better for all of us that I should hear the story&#xD;
from your loving lips, than from the uncharita-&#xD;
ble ones of a stranger."&#xD;
You are right," lie said. ''Give me your&#xD;
promise, then, solemnly and unreservedly, that&#xD;
you will endeavor by every means in your pow-&#xD;
er to conceal your knowledge of your secret&#xD;
from your husband, and above all things, that&#xD;
vou will never let hi  know from whom you&#xD;
(rived your information.  Poor John!" he&#xD;
cried with a sudden burst of grief, and turning&#xD;
fromi me abruptly, again he paced the floor in&#xD;
agitation that he could not control. '' Poor&#xD;
, olin! if any thing could add to your griefup-&#xD;
on discovering that your Caroline's confidence&#xD;
in you was lost forever, it would be to know&#xD;
that I, your only brother, had thus betrayed&#xD;
Even in that hour of my deep distress, I&#xD;
could but notice and appreciate the sensitive&#xD;
delicacy of this young man's disposition. The&#xD;
distress which lie exhibited in being thus forced,&#xD;
as it were, to violate the confidence which had&#xD;
been placed in him, could never have been felt&#xD;
by a mind less innocent, a nature less ingen-&#xD;
ions than his own.  It is true, the specious&#xD;
sophistry by which lie strove to comfort himself,&#xD;
in exacting this promise of secrecy from me,&#xD;
did not deceive my less charitable nature. I&#xD;
knew, as if the spirit of prophecy had been given&#xD;
to me, that John and I could never be recon-&#xD;
ciled ; that no time, no circumstances could&#xD;
obliterate from my mind the remembrance of&#xD;
the deception lie had practiced upon me ; but&#xD;
knowing this, what difference could it really&#xD;
make whether or not he misinterpreted the&#xD;
cause of my estrangement? I thought the con-&#xD;
eealnieit a foolish and a needless one, but I&#xD;
pitied the struggles in my companion's mind,&#xD;
aind I hesitated no longer to give him the pledge&#xD;
required.&#xD;
"I promise you, Eddie," I said, " as far as&#xD;
I can, I will conceal from John entirely my&#xD;
knowledge of his dishonor; and rest assured,&#xD;
that never, through me, shall he learn to doubt&#xD;
the sincerity of the love you bear him."&#xD;
''Take your seat, then, and 1 will tell you&#xD;
all; but, Caroline, be merciful in your judg-&#xD;
iment ; remember that all are not possessed of&#xD;
your str'oiig nature, so stanch in rectitude, so&#xD;
unassailable in pride ;nor do others view such&#xD;
fats as his have beens in the extreme light&#xD;
&#xD;
that you have been taught to regard them. The&#xD;
crime, inexcusable as it was, has now been long&#xD;
ago forgotten by all save the very fev whom it&#xD;
most intimately concerns ; nor indeed has it&#xD;
ever been known publicly enough to bring upon&#xD;
the name you bear the scandal of the world-&#xD;
The sin has been repented and atoned for, the&#xD;
injured parties have long since forgiven the&#xD;
culprit, and his wife is now the only one whose&#xD;
judgment he will have to dread. Remember,&#xD;
even while your judgment condemns him, your&#xD;
love and pity are his due by every claim that&#xD;
your duty or your heart can assert in his be-&#xD;
half."&#xD;
The first tears which had moistened my eyes&#xD;
since I had read that fatal letter, now filled them&#xD;
as I listened to the impassioned pleading of this&#xD;
loving brother, but I brushed them hastily away,&#xD;
ashamed that he should witness such an evi-&#xD;
dence of weakness.&#xD;
''Hush, Eddie," I said huskily; ''you mean&#xD;
kindly, I know, but your words are torture t"&#xD;
me now. Tell me all, and tell me quickly, for&#xD;
my strength is failing me, and this suspense I&#xD;
shall not much longer be able to endure."&#xD;
lIe resumed his seat by the table again, as I&#xD;
spoke, and at length with evident reluctance&#xD;
began his story.&#xD;
"You are aware, Caroline, that I am but&#xD;
the half-brother of your husband. After the&#xD;
death of his first wife, our father, Dr. Harring-&#xD;
ton, removed to Boston with his two children,&#xD;
and installing them in a boarding-house under&#xD;
the care of a widow lady, whom he had en-&#xD;
gaged as a governess, entered upon the duties&#xD;
of his profession in this city.  That widow lady&#xD;
was my mother ; she became his second wife,&#xD;
but only survived her marriage a brief twelve-&#xD;
month, and then she died, leaving me a helpless&#xD;
babe, dependent for life itself upon the affec-&#xD;
tion of my half-sister.  That affection has&#xD;
never failed me.  Jenny, unselfish and ener-&#xD;
getic then as now, from that time took upon&#xD;
herself the double duties of housekeeper and&#xD;
nurse, and gratefully do I acknowledge that&#xD;
never have I felt the loss of my mother, since&#xD;
she, my true-hearted sister, adopted me for her&#xD;
own. When I was three years of age my fa-&#xD;
ther died, and after that, the path we poor chil-&#xD;
dren were forced to tread was' thorny enough.&#xD;
We had a small property left to us at father's&#xD;
death, and with the closest economy we were&#xD;
able to live upon it until Jenny, when I was&#xD;
old enough to release her from home duties,&#xD;
obtained her situation at Netrleby's, land we&#xD;
were afterward enabled to get along more com-&#xD;
fortably. As soons as John was old enough,&#xD;
&#xD;
he, too, began to look for employment. Thanks&#xD;
to the public-schools and our own ambition, we&#xD;
had early acquired the, rudiments of a good ed-&#xD;
ucation, and so John, upon attaining his ma-&#xD;
jority, found himself fully competent to under-&#xD;
take the duties of a clerk. After a few years'&#xD;
knocking around the world, first trying one&#xD;
scheme, then another, lie was at last'fortunate&#xD;
enough to obtain what we all hoped would&#xD;
prove a permanent situation. As you doubt-&#xD;
less anticipate, it was in the firm of Casey &amp;amp;&#xD;
Co. The senior partner, Mr. John Casey, had&#xD;
been an old friend and school-mate of father's,&#xD;
and it was through that friendship that his son&#xD;
securgd this desirable opening. lie was only&#xD;
with them three months-"  Here the speaker&#xD;
stammered, hesitated, and finally broke down&#xD;
altogether in his narration.&#xD;
"Go on !" I cried, with fierce impatience,&#xD;
and he commenced again.&#xD;
"They were very careless in their money-&#xD;
matters there ; Mr. Casey, in particular, was&#xD;
culpably inattentive. The boy was so young ;&#xD;
lie had been so hardly brought up ; so limited&#xD;
in all his'expenditures ; so many needs were&#xD;
pressing upon him and his loved ones, and the&#xD;
temptations which surrounded him were so ter-&#xD;
rible, that-that-I can't, Caro-1 can't tell&#xD;
you."  And :stopping abruptly, Eddie's head&#xD;
sank upon his arms as they rested on the table&#xD;
before him, and his slight frame shook with&#xD;
suppressed agitation.&#xD;
1 could not speak ; I dared not even tell him&#xD;
to go on, and so we sat in a wretched silence&#xD;
that seemed to last for ages. At last Eddie&#xD;
arose from his chair.&#xD;
" I have a newspaper somewhere up stairs&#xD;
that contains a full account of the whole mat-&#xD;
ter," lie said hurriedly. " I will bring it to&#xD;
you, and you can read it for yourself, for I find&#xD;
it is impossible for me to give you the account&#xD;
you -equire. I will go now and get it."  And&#xD;
then he left the room.&#xD;
He returned in a few moments, carrying in&#xD;
lis hand a newspaper, which lie opened and&#xD;
folded so that a particular column should be&#xD;
exposed. He placed it in my hands, pointing&#xD;
out as he did so the article which he wished&#xD;
me to read. He was very much excited ; his&#xD;
face was colorless to the very lips, and lie trem-&#xD;
bled so that hie could scarcely stand. I was&#xD;
calm enough now ; the agitation which I had&#xD;
endured during the last twenty-four hours had&#xD;
at length reached such a crisis, that I had be-&#xD;
come apathetic from the very intensity of my&#xD;
feelings.&#xD;
\While Eddie threw himself into a chair from&#xD;
&#xD;
pure inability to stand, I rose from         my seat,&#xD;
and, with the paper in my hand, walked steadi-&#xD;
ly to thie window, where I stood and read the&#xD;
designated article from    beginning to end; slow-&#xD;
ly, attentively, calmly; inset missing~ a word ;&#xD;
understanding every cruel sentence ; feeling as&#xD;
if the terrible information it conveyed were be-&#xD;
ing imprinted upomi my brain with letters of&#xD;
fire.   This was what I read:&#xD;

MY HUSBAND'S CRIME.&#xD;

lead to the reformation of the criminal, yet we sadly&#xD;
doubt it. The atrocity of the young reprobate's conduct&#xD;
proves his hardened depravity, and we honestly believe&#xD;
that a few years in the penitentiary now, might save him&#xD;
from the gallows hereafter.&#xD;
When I had finished reading I turned to the&#xD;
table again ; Eddie still sat there, his head&#xD;
buried in his arms.&#xD;
Speak to me," I said; ''let your testimo-&#xD;
ny confirm the evidence of my own senses. Is&#xD;
this man of whom I have just read-this man&#xD;
hereby proven a thief and a murderer-is this&#xD;
man John Iarrington, my husband ?"&#xD;
He looked up at tue with a scared, depreca-&#xD;
ting look on his white face.&#xD;
"Be merciful, Caroline ; you know not all&#xD;
the temptations which lured my unhappy broth-&#xD;
er to the commission of that fatal crime. No&#xD;
parent's eye had watched his tempted youth ;&#xD;
remember that.    When none were near to&#xD;
warn or restrain, it is little marvel that evil&#xD;
companions beguiled him into the paths of&#xD;
error. He found himself inextricably involved&#xD;
iii the toils which had been spread for him, al-&#xD;
most before he had dreamed of danger ; and&#xD;
then how bitter was his remorse ! how wild his&#xD;
despair ! To free himself from those hateful&#xD;
fetters lie stooped to theft ! The money was to&#xD;
have been taken but as a loan, and would have&#xD;
been repaid as soon as untiring industry and&#xD;
launtless resolution should have given him the&#xD;
means to do so. That deed of shame would&#xD;
have been his last sin ; the morrow was to have&#xD;
been the beginning of a new life. As for that&#xD;
miserable pistol-shot, I swear to you it was ac-&#xD;
&#xD;
cidental; the newspaper lies about it. There&#xD;
was no deliberate aim, no intentional firing ;&#xD;
the whole transaction was over in a few sec-&#xD;
ouds, and the poor, trembling, guilty wretch&#xD;
was at his master's feet voluntarily, almost be-&#xD;
fore that master could realize the scene before&#xD;
him.  Think of all this! Pity the agony he&#xD;
must have endured, and remember how long&#xD;
and manfully he has since striven in the paths&#xD;
of duty and of honor.  Think of his youth-''&#xD;
But here I interrupted him scornfully.&#xD;
" llis youth !" I cried ; ihe was four or&#xD;
five-and-twenty at least ; older than either you&#xD;
or. I now are.  Had he been a boy of sixteen or&#xD;
eighteen, yoetl might perhaps have been his&#xD;
plea, but as it is--" I could say no more ; my&#xD;
indignant tongue could find no words that&#xD;
could fittingly express the contemptuous rage&#xD;
that filled my soul.&#xD;
&#xD;
entirely? Jenny herself is ignorant of it, I&#xD;
know, from what she said this morning. It is&#xD;
strange that you, of all others, should have been&#xD;
your brother's confidant."&#xD;
'' I was not made so by his will," he answer-&#xD;
ed. "Like yourself, I, by chance, discovered&#xD;
sufficient to awaken me to fearfully eager in-&#xD;
quiry, and finally John consented to reveal to&#xD;
me the whole dark story, sacrificing his own&#xD;
pride to warn me of the dangers which he had&#xD;
so narrowly escaped in-_yielding to the tempta-&#xD;
tions of evil company and the love of gain."&#xD;
" Ie told you this?  le, my husband, con-&#xD;
fessed himself to be what this paper calls him,&#xD;
a thief and a murderer? There can be no mis-&#xD;
take ?-he confessed it ?" And I gazed into his&#xD;
face as if I would have read his very soul.&#xD;
Ie could not meet my imploring eyes; he&#xD;
turned away his head, answering falteringly-&#xD;
" Alas, yes ! Why will you force me to re-&#xD;
peat the miserable truth ?"&#xD;
It was enough. My last hope was shattered,&#xD;
and I was obliged to confess that there was no&#xD;
longer room for doubt.  Every proof that I&#xD;
could possibly demand had been given to me.&#xD;
I could realize, even then, the full force of&#xD;
all that I had heard ; realize and act upon it.&#xD;
My mind was clear enough now ; my heart&#xD;
ceased to ache, my brain ceased to reel as I&#xD;
stood there, stern and silent, before the trem-&#xD;
bliung, white-lipped man, who dared not even&#xD;
look upon my anguish. There was iio time&#xD;
now for wailing and wringing of hands; all&#xD;
the torture of suspense which had been racking&#xD;
&#xD;
me for the last twenty-four hours was now for-&#xD;
ever gone. A stolid composure was settling&#xD;
upon me, and I suffered no longer. A feeling&#xD;
almost of triumph was in my heart, and flash-&#xD;
ed in my eyes as I recognized this fact.&#xD;
I spoke to Eddie as I turned to leave the room.&#xD;
"I have learned now all that I wish to&#xD;
know. I will torment you with no farther&#xD;
questions. For the part you have this day&#xD;
acted toward me I shall be grateful to you al-&#xD;
ways. Good-bye !" And I extended to him my&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
Ie caught it eagerly.&#xD;
"You frighten me, Caroline ! Why do you&#xD;
look at me so strangely? Why do you bid me&#xD;
good-bye ?"&#xD;
"Nay! you have no reason to be alarmed&#xD;
now," I said.  ''I am calm, as I told you I&#xD;
should be when once that fearful suspense was&#xD;
&#xD;
A new thought occurred to me as I met the over.  I bid you good-bye because I am going&#xD;
gaze of Eddie's appealing eves.             to my room now, and as I shall not come down&#xD;
" How is it, I shen rply cried, '' that you to supper, it will doubtless be some time cre I&#xD;

&#xD;
to me forever; that my life was completely&#xD;
wrecked, and that all joy, and hope, and peace+&#xD;
was henceforth forever blotted out of my ex-&#xD;
istence. I realized it all, but it caused me no&#xD;
suffering, no forebodings. Later 1 accounted&#xD;
for this insensibility upon the grounds that my&#xD;
physical system had received through the&#xD;
nerves so severe a shock, that I was really in-&#xD;
capable of feeling other pain.  TI'he torture&#xD;
which I that night, and many weeks afterward,&#xD;
endured from the excited condition of nerves&#xD;
and brain, mercifully spa'red me the mental&#xD;
agony which, if added at that time to my phys-&#xD;
ical suffering, must certainly have proved in-&#xD;
supportable.&#xD;
Through the long, dark, silent watches of the&#xD;
night I lay there, my head aching, my pulses&#xD;
throbbing, my mind incessantly brooding on&#xD;
wild, impracticable plans for the future ; that&#xD;
dark, terrible future in which, strive as I&#xD;
might, I could see no ray of light, no hope of&#xD;
peace. I do not now remember what my in-&#xD;
tentions for my after-life really were. Indeed&#xD;
I much doubt whether any actual plans existed&#xD;
in my mind, spite of all my weary thinking and&#xD;
contriving. Vague, chaotic schemes of seeking&#xD;
my livelihood among strangers, sometimes in&#xD;
the crowds of a vast city, sometimes in the&#xD;
loneliest wilds I could dream of finding, flitted&#xD;
confusedly through my brain. Only one idea&#xD;
was plain and clear through the mists that were&#xD;
gathering over my mental vision, and that was&#xD;
that I must escape from John by some means&#xD;
or other, immediately and forever.  I shrank&#xD;
with absolute terror from the thought of meet-&#xD;
ing him again, and I felt that any step, how-&#xD;
ever wild and desperate, which would carry me&#xD;
far from him, would become to me feasible and&#xD;
&#xD;
easy. The only part of my plans for the future longed-for time of action to arrive.  Wlhei&#xD;

deducting the expense of the railway ticket,&#xD;
with close precision and surprising accuracy.&#xD;
I was clear-headed thieni as I had ever been ;&#xD;
clear-headed enough to feel that the physical&#xD;
distress which I was then suffering, and which&#xD;
seemed hourly to increase, might perhaps be&#xD;
the precursor of some terrible disease.  I ic-&#xD;
quiesced sullenly to this unforeseen ailliction.&#xD;

free from his loathsome presence, I care not&#xD;

In consequence of my request and Eddie's&#xD;
.clear management, no one came near me, or&#xD;
disturbed my supposed slunbers that evening.&#xD;
When John's foot came up the stairs he paused&#xD;
for a moment at my door as if listening to hear&#xD;
if there were any signs of wakefulness within.&#xD;
All was silence ; and, with a heavy sigh, which&#xD;
I could hear as plainly as if that barred door&#xD;
had not stood between us, lie passed on into the&#xD;
chamber adjoining my own, in which I hind uc-&#xD;
quested that lie should sleep. 'In a short time&#xD;
iall was quiet within the house, anid soon all&#xD;
out-door bustle had ceased as well, and the&#xD;
reign of the ' solemn sisters," Silence and&#xD;
Darkness, was upon us.&#xD;
A clock in the room beneath me kept mie&#xD;
cognizant of the time, and as it chimed out&#xD;
each successive hour, I seemed to grow mt-&#xD;
mentarily more wakeful, more watchful for the&#xD;

I obeyed mechanically, and while he dismiss-&#xD;

I stole up to my room, and groped my way in&#xD;
the dark to the sofa, upon which I fell as I&#xD;
reached it, totally exhausted, and almost in a&#xD;
state of insensibility.&#xD;
A moment later, and John had followed me.&#xD;
He closed the door as he entered the room, and&#xD;
turned the key in the lock.&#xD;
"Where is your candle ?" he said ; and al-&#xD;
most inaudibly I directed him to it. He light-&#xD;
ed it, and, as the blaze of the match glared up,&#xD;
I, for the first time since our meeting, caught a&#xD;
full view of his face. Ie was deadly pale ; his&#xD;
brow sternly corrugated with frowning lines,&#xD;
his mouth compressed until the bloodless lips&#xD;
were hardly distinguishable, and an expression&#xD;
of dark and fearful passion disfiguring his face,&#xD;
such as I had hitherto little dreamed that fa--&#xD;
miliar countenance could wear.&#xD;
"And now, Mrs. Harrington," he said at&#xD;
&#xD;
forcibly that the sharp setting of a ring which I&#xD;
wore upon it was forced into the flesh so as t&#xD;
draw blood.&#xD;
I gave a faint cry of pain.&#xD;
" Oh ! John, don't ! you hurt me ; loosen my&#xD;
hand !"&#xD;
lie obeyed as soon as he comprehended my&#xD;
meaning, and the sight of the blood produced&#xD;
in him a complete revulsion of feeling.&#xD;
" My God! what a wretch am I becoming!&#xD;
Poor little hand that I have loved so well&#xD;
And obeying the new impulse, he raised my&#xD;
hand to his face, and covered it with passionate&#xD;
kisses.&#xD;
This evidence of love was more terrifying to&#xD;
me, if possible, than his former anger had been&#xD;
-the more so, that in my own heart the action&#xD;
awoke a strange, wild throb of joy that too well&#xD;
I knew sprang from the knowledge of his un-&#xD;
diminished affection. I could not bear it. I&#xD;
was not yet all ice, and, 0 my God! if love&#xD;

strength enough to draw my hand from his pas-&#xD;
sionate grasp.&#xD;
Don't, don't," I cried piteously. " You tor-&#xD;
ture me. There is a note on the desk there ;&#xD;
read that. It will tell you all that I have to&#xD;
say."&#xD;
fe turned eagerly, and snatched up the paper&#xD;
almost before I had ceased to speak. A fresh&#xD;
storm of rage and anguish swept over his face as&#xD;
he perused it. Throwing it angrily from him&#xD;
he turned to ne again.&#xD;
"'You confess it ! you dare to confess it!&#xD;

tains were written by no mad impulse, no wild&#xD;
infatuation, but are now as then the sober ex-&#xD;

the fierce gleam of the angry eyes that were&#xD;
bent upon me, I thought, with a shudder, "It&#xD;
was thus lie looked when he leveled the pistol&#xD;
at his benefactor's head !" and I cried-&#xD;
If they are not the expression of my feel-&#xD;
iugs now, it is only because no words are strong&#xD;
enough or bitter enough to express the hatred&#xD;
that has crept into my heart toward you, John&#xD;
Ilarriiinonu."&#xD;
"'lthen God help us all !" he said, and his&#xD;
face looked ghastly in the mingled light of the&#xD;
sickly blaze of the candle, and the shadowy day-&#xD;
light tliat was commencing to creep through the&#xD;
curtains of the windows.     -&#xD;
lie glared at me for a moment in horrible&#xD;
silence ; then lie caine to my side, and laid his&#xD;
hand heavily upon my shoulder.&#xD;

if it conquers me, will bring the three of us to&#xD;
a bloody grave-hirn first, and you and me a&#xD;
moment later ?"&#xD;
his words brought a new terror upon me.&#xD;
IIe knew then of the share which his brother&#xD;
had taken in betraying his fatal secret. Yet&#xD;
how could I have hoped to conceal it?  his&#xD;
own conscience must have told him the cause&#xD;
.          of my behavior, and as l ddie was the only per-&#xD;
son cognizant of his crime, it was only natural&#xD;
that lie should iustinctively have fixed upon him&#xD;
as my informant.&#xD;
"0 John ! John !" I wailed in my bitter&#xD;
agony, "if you could kill rue without bringing&#xD;
fresh crime upon your own head, how unresist-&#xD;
inigly, how gladly would I receive my death-&#xD;
btlow from your hands!"&#xD;
'I'he sight of may distress softened thre fierce&#xD;

seemed to take possession of him.  ie sank&#xD;
into a chair and buried his face in his hands.&#xD;
" I thought I could make you happy," ie&#xD;
said. "Ithought I had succeeded in doing so.&#xD;
Why have you deceived me so long ?"&#xD;
The injustice of the accusation roused me.&#xD;
"I have not deceived you," Icried.  "You&#xD;
knew my feelings before I married you. I never&#xD;
strove to disguise them."&#xD;
".But I thought it was all a girlish fancy, long&#xD;
since forgotten. I thought that your true wifely&#xD;
love for me, your husband, had long since ena-&#xD;

"I shall never overcome it," I said passion-&#xD;
ately.  "I could not and remain the woman I&#xD;
am.   I had hoped to have avoided this fearful&#xD;
scene of anger and recrimination, but now that&#xD;
it has come, let us accept the issue as best we&#xD;

lie rose and walked the room in violent agi-&#xD;

time quite incapable of speaking. At last he&#xD;
came to me again, and his face, though white&#xD;
and agitated, was free from the disfiguring traces&#xD;
of passion which hitherto had marred it.&#xD;

his words were true ; I felt that ; yet still&#xD;
every instinct in my nature cried out for free-&#xD;

"I can not, I can not be your wife !" was all&#xD;
that I could say.&#xD;
A spasm of pain contracted his features, but&#xD;
with great effort lie controlled himself, and&#xD;
in a still gentler tone continued-&#xD;

There was a depth of pathos inhis tone that lie caught my hands as lie finished speaking,&#xD;

&#xD;
I gazed into the excited face of the man I&#xD;
loved, and read the intense devotion his eyes&#xD;
expressed, and I became a weak, pitiable cow-&#xD;

felt that I was dishonoring the race I sprang&#xD;

night and day, with no rest save the unhealthy which it was now battling, all these events were&#xD;
stupor, at long intervals produced by opiates, as completely obliterated from my mind as if&#xD;
through weeks of suffering to myself, and of they had never caused me grief. Far back into&#xD;
torturing suspense to those who loved me, 1 the days of my girlhood my mind rambled, and&#xD;
struggled through a desperate contest with I babbled ceaselessly of " Sc," and "father,"&#xD;
death, alnd even when I finally was proclaimed and "baby Agnes."  Then again I was back in&#xD;

comllished; yet it has this one objection-(a was that of Frank Nettleby and his big account-&#xD;
&#xD;
serious one to me, for I am trying to tell an&#xD;
" ower true" tale)-reality refuses to carry out&#xD;
the idea.  Except in a romance, no brain-fever&#xD;
patient ever made any revelation to which a&#xD;
sane mind could be tempted to give credence.&#xD;
Unintelligible muttering, broken, disconnected&#xD;
sentences, plainly testify to the unnatural char-&#xD;
acter of the thoughts which the diseased brain&#xD;
conceives. If any central idea is harped neon&#xD;
by the unconscious sufferer, it is seldom one that&#xD;
the state of his mind at the time of his illness&#xD;
might be supposed to call forth.   Very fre-&#xD;
quently some entirely imaginary person or event&#xD;
becomes the phantom around which his fancy&#xD;
conjures up a thousand terrors. Seldom, if ever,&#xD;
I suppose, does the memory remain sufficiently&#xD;
alive to call into action the genuine sorrows of&#xD;
the patient.  His ravings, however fierce, how-&#xD;
ever imncessant, are utterly meaningless, and are&#xD;
quite powerless either to attract attention or to&#xD;
satisfy curiosity.&#xD;
It is a pity perhaps for the artistic effect of&#xD;
&#xD;
bool, into which I was copying, under his be-&#xD;
wildering auspices, endless bills of sales that&#xD;
would mix themselves inextricably together,'to&#xD;
unfatlhom which, my tired brain would work&#xD;
fruitlessly, hour after hour, until physical ex-&#xD;
haustion induced the stupor from  which I&#xD;
could only be aroused to relapse into fresh&#xD;
delirium.&#xD;
The only circumstance attending my illness&#xD;
which testified that the late suffering I had un-&#xD;
dergone still retained any hold upon my mind,&#xD;
was the fact that throughout the whole time of&#xD;
my delirium I refused to allow my husband's&#xD;
attendance. His approach was always the sig-&#xD;
nal for fiercer raving, more uncontrollable ex-&#xD;
citement. I would take no medicine from his&#xD;
hand, nor permit him to come near me, or wait&#xD;
up1)on1 me in any manner.&#xD;
Poor John ! Whatever his faults might have&#xD;
been, his sufferings during those days and weeks&#xD;
were intense enough to have balanced them.&#xD;
Fortunately for both of us, my conduct toward&#xD;

my story that the novelist's theory is not the true him was accredited entirely to the workings of&#xD;

&#xD;
manner precisely contrary to what he would do&#xD;
in a state of health.&#xD;
After many weeks of suffering, at length the&#xD;
day came when reason again held sway. Not&#xD;
clearly and thoroughly at first, but, little by&#xD;
little, with my increasing strength, my mind re-&#xD;
sumed its natural tone, and with returning rea-&#xD;
son, alas ! came also returning memory, and I&#xD;
wondered, in my impotent wretchedness, why it&#xD;
had pleased God to bring me back again to a&#xD;
life that for me had nothing but sin and sorrow.&#xD;
I did not mend rapidly ; there was no desire for&#xD;
life in my heart, and long after all active disease&#xD;
was exterminated, did I lie upon my bed, nerve-&#xD;
less and dispirited, gaining no strength either&#xD;
in body or mind, simply and only because I&#xD;
would not.&#xD;
I saw very little of John at this time. Fear-&#xD;
ing, I suppose, that the excitement of his pres-&#xD;
ence would be injurious to me,.he troubled me&#xD;
as seldom as possible with his company, and it&#xD;
was easy to account to others for his conduct&#xD;
on the grounds that the ill effect his presence&#xD;
had had upon me during my delirium might&#xD;
still continue while I was so weak as I still ap-&#xD;
peared to be. But, though he came into my&#xD;
room but seldom during the day, and made his&#xD;
visits as short as they were rare, yet I was in-&#xD;
stinctively conscious at all times of his incessant&#xD;
watchfulness.&#xD;
During my illness and convalescence, Miss&#xD;
Jenny occupied by night a couch in my room,&#xD;
and, during the time when I really required&#xD;
her attention, a more untiring and faithful&#xD;
nurse no mortal ever had. But when the time&#xD;
of actual danger was passed, and I required no&#xD;
attentions, save those which I could call for&#xD;
when necessary, though she still persisted in&#xD;
retaining her position as nurse, she found her&#xD;
task a light one, and her night's repose was fre-&#xD;
quently completely uninterrupted.&#xD;
At that stage of my recovery I would lay,&#xD;
awake at night, suffering no pain, in no want&#xD;
of any thing that mortal aid could give me, yet&#xD;
feeling, oh ! so unutterably wretched and for-&#xD;
saken ! And it was at these times I became&#xD;
conscious that I suffered not alone ; that my&#xD;
sick-room  was haunted by the presence of a&#xD;
love that never tired, a care that never slept.&#xD;
Often, when waking suddenly from the light,&#xD;
fitful slumber of the invalid, would I open my&#xD;
eyes upon the care-worn face of my husband,&#xD;
bending anxiously over me.   At such times,&#xD;
with some faint attempt at excusing his pres-&#xD;
&#xD;
ence there, he would withdraw abruptly from&#xD;
my sight, leaving me to imagine, as he sup-&#xD;
posed, that I was again alone. Yet, though I&#xD;
&#xD;
made no sign acknowledging his presence, I felt&#xD;
that he was always near me, and oh! of how much&#xD;
misery and loneliness did that knowledge be-&#xD;
guile me ! The subtle sophistries of pride vain-&#xD;
ly contended with the power of nature in those&#xD;
hours of unreasoning languor. The love that&#xD;
I despised and rejected, was at once my com-&#xD;
fort and my salvation. 1 should have died, I&#xD;
think, even after the disease was conquered, of&#xD;
pure disgust of life, had it not been for the&#xD;
knowledge of that grand, unselfish sympathy,&#xD;
the thorough conviction of my husband's de-&#xD;
voted love.&#xD;
One night, when I awakened to find him&#xD;
bending over me, he did not retreat as lie us'mah-&#xD;
ly did, but stood, still gazing at me, his anxious&#xD;
eyes scanning my face, as if to read therein the&#xD;
solution of a question which lie dared not ask.&#xD;
'" You are more restless to-night than usual,&#xD;
Caroline ; I fear you are getting no stronger."&#xD;
" I know that I am not," I said, turning my&#xD;
head wearily upon the pillow, as if to terminate&#xD;
the conversation.  He saw and understood the&#xD;
motion, but he persevered.&#xD;
'Why is it ?  You have no disease ; the&#xD;
fever has quite left you ; you are young, ener-&#xD;
getic, elastic, with a constitution, your physi-&#xD;
cian tells you, of unsurpassed vitality. Why&#xD;
should you not grow stronger ?"&#xD;
I turned my face toward him, and raised my&#xD;
eyes sadly to his.&#xD;
"I suppose it is because I have no desire to&#xD;
live. I don't want to talk recklessly, Joln ;&#xD;
I try not to feel so ; if it pleases God to raise&#xD;
me up again, I will take up the burden of life&#xD;
unmurmuringly ; but-but-you know how I&#xD;
feel-I don't want to live."&#xD;
"Do you know how it tortures me to hear&#xD;
you say this ?" he said, aid his pale, haggard&#xD;
face seemed to become still paler, still more&#xD;
haggard as he spoke.  " You used to be kind-&#xD;
hearted, Caroline ; I have seen you weep over&#xD;
a dead bird ; and the sufferings of an over-task-&#xD;
ed animal could once arouse your liveliest sym-&#xD;
pathy. have you no feeling now for me?&#xD;
Can you spare no pity for my sufferings? Look&#xD;
upon me !" And snatching up the candle, he&#xD;
held it so that the light fell full upon his face.&#xD;
"Do you see the change the last few weeks&#xD;
have wrought in me ?" And as I looked, the&#xD;
first emotion that had touched my benumbed&#xD;
heart since my illness, melted its torpor then,&#xD;
and the tears sprang to my eyes as I gazed&#xD;
upon the hollow eyes and wasted features.&#xD;
" Poor ,John !" I said, with quivering lips,&#xD;
" how selfishly blind I have been. You have&#xD;
growns quite grey !" And I covered may eyes with&#xD;

my hand, that he might not see the emotion I&#xD;
was too weak to repress.&#xD;
"Ay !" he continued, "my grief has made&#xD;
of mue a prematurely old man. have pity on&#xD;
me, Caroline ; spare me farther suffering.&#xD;
Throw off this sinful lassitude that is killing&#xD;
you, and torturing me. It has pleased God to&#xD;
spare you, and you are just as surely rejecting&#xD;
the life he gives you by your indifference to it&#xD;
as you would be by violently casting it from you.&#xD;
I know, and you know, that the will to live is&#xD;
all that is lacking to your recovery."&#xD;
"IHow can I wish to get well ?" I said pit-&#xD;
cously.  "Life is so dreary, so tiresome; all&#xD;
joy- has gone out of it; I have nothing left to&#xD;
live for."&#xD;
"You have many things to live for," lie an-&#xD;
swered with gentle tenderness.  "You have&#xD;
friends who love you, and whom you love ; you&#xD;
are yet young, and life with all its beautiful&#xD;
possibilities is spread before you ; time will&#xD;
temper the keenness of the sorrows that now&#xD;
encompass you, and you will yet live to find&#xD;
that the truest happiness earth can give, the&#xD;
pleasure of making others happy, may still be&#xD;
yours.  Yet more, Caroline; you have my&#xD;
love, and little as you value it now, you will&#xD;
find, when health returns to you, that it is by&#xD;
no means a worthless offering. Oh ! my dear&#xD;
one, do you not know how my heart yearns&#xD;
over you? Not even in the days of your girlish&#xD;
beauty, when so blindly I thought that I had&#xD;
won your heart; not even in the days of early&#xD;
wedlock, when I believed that neither earth nor&#xD;
heaven could produce a being more beloved and&#xD;
loving than my own dear bride; nor yet when&#xD;
I saw my child within your arms, and the holy&#xD;
light of mother love beaming in your eyes had&#xD;
doubly endeared to me my wife ; nor even,&#xD;
when sorrowing over that infant's tiny grave,&#xD;
you wept upon my breast, though then I&#xD;
thought I could not love you more;-never, no,&#xD;
never have you been so dear to me as now-&#xD;
now, when I know that I have lost you. Oh,&#xD;
my love ! my love! Do you think I have not&#xD;
sorrowed with you?  Do you think one pang&#xD;
has wrung your heart that has not tortured&#xD;
mine with sympathetic grief?  I have prayed&#xD;
for death, even in the same breath that I prayed&#xD;
for grace to aid me in withholding violent&#xD;
hands from may own life, for I have thought&#xD;
that with my death, happiness might again re-&#xD;
turn to you-"&#xD;
"t No, no! oh, no!" I gasped, interrupting the&#xD;
paSssionate flow of words. " Oh ! John, you&#xD;
could not think that!"&#xD;
-" I will try not to think it again, love, for I&#xD;
&#xD;
believe that I can make even my worthless life&#xD;
a blessing to you, and that in God's mysterious&#xD;
providence, even my rejected love may comfort&#xD;
you. I ask for no return; God help me! I&#xD;
know that can not be ; only your pity --only&#xD;
your pity. Live, Caroline, live to bestow it&#xD;
1upon inc."&#xD;
He leaned against the bed-post, white and&#xD;
exhausted ; powerless to say more, yet pleading&#xD;
with me still with his eyes.  The tears were&#xD;
running down my cheeks, and my heart turned&#xD;
to him in his misery, until I felt that had he&#xD;
then asked me for my love, I must have given&#xD;
it to him, in spite of his sin and my pride.&#xD;
" I will try to live, John, for your sake,"&#xD;
I said, and then I turned my face away and&#xD;
wept.&#xD;
The tears did me good, I think ; they were&#xD;
the first which I had shed since my sorrow ;&#xD;
they broke up the torpor which encased me ;&#xD;
they softened my heart from its selfish grief;&#xD;
and as divine pity shed her radiance over my&#xD;
distracted soul, I began to think more of others&#xD;
and less of myself, and to remember that what-&#xD;
ever John's sins might have been, I, too, had&#xD;
been far from blameless.&#xD;
I framed new resolutions for the life which&#xD;
must henceforth be before me; I could no&#xD;
longer be the trusting wife of the man who&#xD;
had deceived me, but I would be the faithful&#xD;
friend of the man who loved me; my soul&#xD;
yearned over him in his remorseful sorrow, as&#xD;
a mother's over her first-born. In that moment&#xD;
of pitying tenderness, I began to frame excuses&#xD;
for the crime which, in sterner moments, I had&#xD;
pronounced inexcusable.  I began to think&#xD;
less of the crime and more of the criminal, and&#xD;
the more I pondered upon the miserable affair,&#xD;
the more singular and incomprehensible did the&#xD;
whole story become.   The cold-blooded vil-&#xD;
lainy that characterized the hero of the news-&#xD;
paper paragraph was so utterly foreign to the&#xD;
nature of the man who called me wife, that even&#xD;
the evidence of my own senses seemed insuf-&#xD;
ficient to convince me in my calmer moments&#xD;
of its existence in him. Treachery, deceit, in-&#xD;
gratitude, love of money, a passion for gam-&#xD;
bling-all these sins, so foul and degrading, so&#xD;
contemptibly vile, were completely at variance&#xD;
with a nature which, until now, I had consider-&#xD;
ed chiefly admirable from its sensitive honor,&#xD;
its truthful simplicity. If, in the days- of my un-&#xD;
shaken faith in him, I had been asked of what&#xD;

tegrity. I never could trust him again, and&#xD;
that love which had been founded in my faith&#xD;
in him had perished with it, and could never be&#xD;
again resuscitated, however much I might learn&#xD;
to pity and forgive.&#xD;
And forgiveness was no light task for me,&#xD;
even with the full conviction of his sorrow and&#xD;
remorse fresh in my mind and heart. He had&#xD;
wronged me cruelly ; he had linked my father's&#xD;
honored name with that of an all but branded&#xD;
felon; he had ruthlessly violated my dearest&#xD;
and holiest affections ; and he had done all this&#xD;
willfully and knowingly.  Well aware as he&#xD;
was of the peculiarly sensitive pride which was&#xD;
my most prominent characteristic, in the very&#xD;
face of my avowal that I would never forgive&#xD;
the man who should bring dishonor upon my&#xD;
father's proud old name, he had married me-&#xD;
an unsuspicious, confiding girl-with that dark&#xD;
secret of shame and ignominy buried in his bo-&#xD;
som; a secret which he must have known&#xD;
would,if revealed to me, as certainly have pre-&#xD;
vented my becoming his wife, as if I had dis-&#xD;
covered him to have been the husband of an-&#xD;
other woman. There lay the dark page of his&#xD;
transgressions appallingly plain before me; I&#xD;
could not overlook them, nor forget them, nor&#xD;
&#xD;
was evidently, before him, a forbidden one; but&#xD;
the first opportunity I could find, I assailed&#xD;
Jenny with eager inquiries as to the cause of&#xD;
this unexpected misfortune.&#xD;
"Heaven only knows ; I don't," she said&#xD;
crossly.  "A more different man from  the&#xD;
Johin Harrington of six months ago than the&#xD;
John Harrington of to-day, it would be hard&#xD;
to find. I had thought all along that your ill-&#xD;
ness, and his uneasiness about you, had been&#xD;
the cause of his constant gloom and irritability.&#xD;
but I can not say that his temper has improved&#xD;
though your health has. He is sullen and mo-&#xD;
rose as ever, and this quarrel with Frank Net-&#xD;
tleby has been only one of the numberless&#xD;
strange things 'of which he has lately been&#xD;
guilty.  lie has actually forbidden Frank the&#xD;
house, and he tried to persuade mac to leare&#xD;
Nettleby's when he did. A pretty out I should&#xD;
make of hunting for new employment at my&#xD;
time of life ! I'd like to know where the bread&#xD;
and butter is to come from if we all stop work-&#xD;
ing. John's savings were not very extensive,&#xD;
we all know, and your long illness and al the&#xD;
consequent expenses, have made a pretty hig&#xD;
hole in them alcady. Did lie give no reason&#xD;
for his quarrel, do you say? not he ; nor would&#xD;
Frank either, though I tried my best to get in&#xD;
inkling of the matter from both of them. I&#xD;
never believed Frank could be so wrathy as he&#xD;
has managed to be at John; they have quar-&#xD;
reled about something they are both ashamed&#xD;
of, I'll guarantee that. Do you try, Caroline,&#xD;
to find out what it was about. I still think&#xD;
matters can be set straight, if one only knew&#xD;
how to go about it."&#xD;
And I did try to find out, in a faint, irreso-&#xD;
lute sort of fashion. , I could not yet quite ree-&#xD;
oncile my new relations with my husband with&#xD;
&#xD;
excuse them; all that I could do was to pity, free and unembarrassed conversation, but I ven-&#xD;

then, when with desperate courage I ventured his sympathy for me was shown by an unselfish&#xD;

ought to know, and I am astonished that you do for years had been my reliance and my strength,&#xD;

me that by some means Frank, too, had become fection that could not have been more instinct-&#xD;
cognizant of John's dreadful secret. No won- ive and unaffected had he been my own broth-&#xD;

- sensitive nature would not allow him to forgive wise and unsiuitable one, and, as with him, I&#xD;
himself for tile part lie had acted; I could see dreaded to intterfere in any manner, lest I&#xD;
&#xD;
should precipitate where I had really wished to&#xD;
retard. So I shunned all opening for confi-&#xD;
dential communications from her, much as it&#xD;
pained me to see the poor child so perplexed&#xD;
and unhappy.&#xD;
And what shall I say concerning the state of&#xD;
affairs between my husband and myself? a state&#xD;
so unnatural, that many times I felt as if open&#xD;
rupture would have been far less trying to both&#xD;
of us; and had it not been for the sake of Jen-&#xD;
ny and Agnes, I believe I must have given up&#xD;
the hopeless task of glossing o'er our misery'&#xD;
with the tinsel of fair appearances. low I&#xD;
hated and despised the falsehood of our lives!&#xD;
Like the whited sepulchre, so fair and pure&#xD;
without, while inwardly full of foul corruption.&#xD;
No conversation ever passed between us that&#xD;
was not absolutely necessary. I never met his&#xD;
eye if I could avoid doing so, and strive as I&#xD;
would (for I saw the pain such conduct caused&#xD;
him), I could not help the shrinking dread that&#xD;
overpowered me whenever he approached me.&#xD;
Yet, notwithstanding all this, never had his love&#xD;
for me been so palpably evident as now; not&#xD;
shown by words, of course, but by all those&#xD;
thousand trifles in themselves so insignificant,&#xD;
yet so powerfully convincing when looked back&#xD;
upon in their unforgotten completeness.&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
STARTLING REvELATIONS.&#xD;
Ix the summer of the year of which I am&#xD;
about to write, Mr. Henderson died.   The&#xD;
reader may remember that in the second chap-&#xD;
ter of this eventful history I have recorded a&#xD;
conversation which I held with him shortly after&#xD;
my father's death. He was the gentleman in&#xD;
whose employ my father had passed the last ten&#xD;
years of his life. I saw the announcement of&#xD;
his (Mr. Henderson's) death in the morning&#xD;
papers, and though I had not met him for&#xD;
several years, not, in.fact, since my marriage,&#xD;
1 yet remembered gratefully his kindness to me&#xD;
when most I needed friends, and I mourned his&#xD;
death as sincerely if not as deeply as many who&#xD;
had perhaps a better right. My surprise, how-&#xD;
ever, may ho more easily imagined than de-&#xD;
scribed when, shortly after learning this sad in-&#xD;
telligence, I received from Mr. Henderson's&#xD;
lawyer a letter which told me that he had be-&#xD;
queathed to "Caroline Harrington, the daugh-&#xD;
ter of my honored friend the late .Tames B.&#xD;
Manvers, as a mark of respect and affection,&#xD;
the sum of ten thousand dollars."&#xD;
My kind old friend ! How little had I done&#xD;
to deserve this mark of remembrance from his&#xD;
&#xD;
His temper had grown strangely irritable, as hands ! My heart swelled with emotion when&#xD;
indeed could little surprise any one, for, apart I remembered how entirely his kindness had&#xD;
from the troubles between himself and me, the passed out of my memory, and how completely&#xD;
fact of enforced idleness to a man so constitu- I had forgotten almost his very existence, until&#xD;

that perplexed and annoyed him, no cross word more propitious time than did this. Johiu had&#xD;

his words were ever more gently phrased in his laborious and poorly paid, had beei all that he&#xD;

merous and so trivial. A constant regard for hansted, and the coming winter stared us in the&#xD;
my tastes ; habitual deference to my wishes ; face, finding us entirely luiprovided with any&#xD;

had once given me was still nnchangeably my cept it from them, which we were not. On one&#xD;

&#xD;
her "sick mind" could receive, I quite agreed&#xD;
with her as to the expediency of her trying to&#xD;
do something for herself. John, at my request,&#xD;
had sought and obtained for her a situation as&#xD;
teacher in one of the public-schools, and she&#xD;
would commence her labors with the first of the&#xD;
ensuing September.&#xD;
I, too, had felt very bitterly my enforced&#xD;
idleness, and the necessary expenses my long&#xD;
illness had brought upon my husband, and as&#xD;
soon as I was strong enough to make the plan&#xD;
a practicable one, I announced to John my in-&#xD;
tention of trying to find something to do that&#xD;
would lighten his expenses, and render me less&#xD;
dependent on him.&#xD;
"'Dependent on me:" lie cried in bitter&#xD;
scorn.  " Has it really come to that, then,&#xD;
aroline, that you can wantonly insult me with&#xD;
such a speech?"&#xD;
" You misunderstand me, Mr. Harrington,"&#xD;
I said coldly.  "I mean no offense to you, and&#xD;
von are over-sensitive to consider it as such.&#xD;
So soon as you shall be able to work for us both&#xD;
again, I will permit you to do so. In consent-&#xD;
ing to bear your name, and remain under your&#xD;
protection, 1 also conceded to you the privilege&#xD;
of providing for my personal needs--but at&#xD;
present, I think, and you must see yourself, that&#xD;
it is far better you should be as little hampered&#xD;
as possible with idle hands at home, who make&#xD;
your burden of responsibility and ease just that&#xD;
much heavier than it ought to be.  Let me try&#xD;
to procure some needle-work or fine sewing. I&#xD;
suppose, of course, you would object to my en-&#xD;
tering upon any more public employment, but,&#xD;
I think, among Jenny's acquaintances and my&#xD;
own, I can surely find something to do that will&#xD;
help us through this time of need. Every little&#xD;
helps, you know ; and though I am painfully&#xD;
aware of how very little it will be that I can do&#xD;
to help you, still I shall feel musch better if I am&#xD;
allowed to try."&#xD;
I would have added farther details of the little&#xD;
plan I had mentally contrived to provide for me&#xD;
the work I was so anxious to commence, but lie&#xD;
would let sme say no more.&#xD;
''For God's sake, hush, Caroline ! you will&#xD;
drive ue miad.  You going out as a sewing-girl!&#xD;
yjou cringing and begging for the patronage of&#xD;
some would-be fine lady, or supercilious aris-&#xD;
tocrat ! I had rather work on the public roads&#xD;
than permit you thus to degrade yourself. Do&#xD;
not speak of it, or think of it again ; no, nor of&#xD;
any other plan of the sanie nature. I forbid it&#xD;
positively and entirely. Yet hold ; that haughty&#xD;
glance woul tell mse I have no right to forbid&#xD;
you. I will not, then ; hut be generous, Care-&#xD;
&#xD;
line ! pity the anomalous position which I am&#xD;
forced to occupy-my heart full of a husband's&#xD;
love, yet in my hands none of a husband's au-&#xD;
thority."&#xD;
"'I will do as you wish, Mr. Ilarrington,' I&#xD;
said, turning abruptly away, for I feared lest a&#xD;
longer conversation might break down the com-&#xD;
posure which I was now maintaining only by&#xD;
the greatest effort. So I said no more about&#xD;
helping to earn our daily bread, but I proceeded&#xD;
practically to do it, for I dismissed my servant,&#xD;
and turned very energetically to doing my own&#xD;
housework, and I soon found that very little&#xD;
time would I have had aside from that to devote&#xD;
to fine sewing or sewing of any kind.&#xD;
I was several days queen of the kitchen and&#xD;
maid of all work, before John discovered that&#xD;
my girl had left me. lie came upon me acci-&#xD;
dentally one morning as I was carrying a scuttle&#xD;
of coal up the cellar stairs.&#xD;
He descended the stairs, meeting me half-&#xD;
way, and took the scuttle from my hand.&#xD;
''Why do you not let Sarah attend to this ?"'&#xD;
he said reproachfully. ''It is surely her busi-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
I am my own Sarah now," I said, striving&#xD;
to treat the whole affair as a jest. "I am de-&#xD;
termined to immortalize myself, and as you de-&#xD;
clined to let me do it in any other way, I must&#xD;
do it amid pots, kettles, and pans. And I think&#xD;
I have thus far every reason to hope for success."&#xD;
Tie gave no answering smile, but asked, as he-&#xD;
set his burden down by the kitchen stove-&#xD;
"When did you dismiss Sarah ?"&#xD;
"Last Monday, I believe, but I have got along&#xD;
so well without her, that I hardly remember&#xD;
when she did go."&#xD;
" Where does she live? do you know ?"&#xD;
"Now, John Harrington," I cried tempesta-&#xD;
ously, "you need be making no arrangements&#xD;
to hunt her up again, for I tell you plainly, I&#xD;
won't have her ! no, nor any one else, either."&#xD;
"Just for a little while," he said beseech-&#xD;
ingly. "I shall certainly get into some kind&#xD;
of business in the course of the next month, and&#xD;
it is so unnecessary for you to undertake this&#xD;
responsibility. Let me get Sarah back again&#xD;
for a few weeks only, and by that time I dare&#xD;
say there will be no need of doing without her&#xD;
at all."&#xD;
I shook my head resolutely.&#xD;
"No, I'll have none of her. If our circum-&#xD;
stances warrant us in keeping a girl next month,&#xD;
why next month you can get me one, but until&#xD;
then I shall take charge of the house myself-&#xD;
Don't make yourself ridiculous, John. There&#xD;
is nothing to do but what I can get along with&#xD;

very comfortably. We will put out the wash-&#xD;
ing as usual, and with a little help from Agnes,&#xD;
once in a while, I-shall manage all the rest&#xD;
without any trouble."&#xD;
' "I can not allow it," he commenced, but he&#xD;
checked himself as he saw the tears of real&#xD;
vexation that sprang to my eyes. le turned&#xD;
away and finished abruptly.  "God bless you,&#xD;
Caro! do as you please. If you make yourself&#xD;
ill by this extra exertion, I shall never forgive'&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
"No danger," I said, and thus the question&#xD;
was settled decisively, no farther interference&#xD;
on John's part ever troubling my domestic&#xD;
peace, except I considered as interference the&#xD;
fact that from that day he took upon himself&#xD;
the burden of all the heavier household duties,&#xD;
building fires, carrying coal, etc., and saving&#xD;
my labor by every possible means that loving&#xD;
heart could prompt and willing hands em-&#xD;
ploy.&#xD;
It was really singular how unfortunate John&#xD;
had been in his efforts to obtain employment.&#xD;
When he first left Nettleby's, I had thought,&#xD;
and he too, that there would have been no&#xD;
trouble at all in procuring another situation.&#xD;
His having been so long in the employ of that&#xD;
firm would have been sufficient recommenda-&#xD;
tion in itself, we thought, to procure for him a&#xD;
similar situation elsewhere. But, whether the&#xD;
fact of his leaving Nettleby's so suddenly, and&#xD;
without any assigned reason, was considered&#xD;
suspicious; whether any inkling of that old,&#xD;
dark tale of crime and ignominy had got&#xD;
abroad ; or whether, as I was sometimes almost&#xD;
tempted to think, there was some occult influ-&#xD;
enee at work undermining his reputation ; cer-&#xD;
tain it is that most discouraging results met him&#xD;
in his every attempt to find work.&#xD;
IIow much he suffered from these disappoint-{&#xD;
ments that met him at every turn, none knew&#xD;
better than I, bravely as he sought to conceal&#xD;
his anxiety from me. And under all these cir-&#xD;
cunstanees it may easily be understood with{&#xD;
what a delightful sense of relief came to me the&#xD;
tidings of Mr. Henderson's legacy.&#xD;
John was not at home when I received the&#xD;
letter, nor did he return until evening. I was&#xD;
in the kitchen making preparations for tea,&#xD;
when I heard his step in the dining-room. I&#xD;
heard Jenny ask him her usual question at his{&#xD;
return, as to what "luck" had met him in his'&#xD;
day of weary search, and his customary answer,&#xD;
in a tone which I fancied sounded more dis-&#xD;
pirited than usual, "None whatever." Then,&#xD;
without waiting for farther conversation with&#xD;
her, he passed on at once into the kitchen, to&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
fulfill the many little duties that it had become&#xD;
his undeviating practice to perform.&#xD;
I almost forgot our estrangement at that&#xD;
moment. Tossing the letter toward himI cried&#xD;
gayly-&#xD;
" We will have Sarah back again next week.&#xD;
Read that letter and see how rich we have sud-&#xD;
denly become."&#xD;
His face lightened from its despondency as&#xD;
he read it.&#xD;
" I am indeed heartily glad for your sake,&#xD;
Caro."&#xD;
" Yes !" I rattled on, " you can take your&#xD;
time now about getting to work. If peolule find&#xD;
you are not so anxious, they will be readier to&#xD;
employ you, and uow you can wait until you&#xD;
find something that will really suit you. You&#xD;
see Providence always provides a way for those&#xD;
who are willing to help themselves, and though&#xD;
I am very, very sorry fur poor Mr. Ilenderson,&#xD;
I can not help but be glad about the money, for&#xD;
you know, John, we really did need it so badly.&#xD;
I suppose it is inot such a very great fortune,&#xD;
but it seems to me now an inexhaustible sum;&#xD;
a veritable purse of Fortunatus."&#xD;
"Not quite that, my dear," he answered,&#xD;
smiling faintly, " but still quite sufficient, it&#xD;
properly invested, to secure you a competence&#xD;
against all contingencies. If I may be allowed&#xD;
to advise you as to its disposal-"&#xD;
lie hesitated, but I cried indignianitly-&#xD;
Why, John ! how can you ! you know it is&#xD;
as much yours as mine"&#xD;
" Not exactly, but I sluPpose I may consider&#xD;
it such for all intents and purposes until it i.&#xD;
receivett and disposed of. As J was about to&#xD;
say, then, if you are willing, I will invest it for&#xD;
you in some good, reliable stock, which you can&#xD;
realize at a short notice if it is necessary, and&#xD;
which will bring you in, as interest, a regular&#xD;
and certain income. With this and the money&#xD;
yot will receive from Eddie and Jenny for their&#xD;
board, you will be able to manage very coms-&#xD;
fortably until I am able to do something, better&#xD;
for you. As your family after this will be one&#xD;
less, your trouble and expense will be propor-&#xD;
tionably lighter."&#xD;
" What do you mean by my family being one&#xD;
less?" I cried sharply.&#xD;
" Only this, that as I have no longer any&#xD;
hope of getting any employment that will suit me&#xD;
in Boston, and as I shall now be able to leave&#xD;
you in easy circumstances, I shall go to New&#xD;
York as soon as I can get off, and endeavor to&#xD;
find occupation there."&#xD;
lie spoke very gesitly mand very kisndhy, b)ut&#xD;
so resolutely that I sawv that Isis mind wams made&#xD;

up, and that the fact of his departure was with  "Nou could very easily receive benefits from&#xD;
him a settled thing. My heart throbbed wildly the man who loved you, and who, you knew,&#xD;
as I asked him--                          had the right to love and care for you. I should&#xD;
"how long shall you be gone ?"          have no hesitation whatever, Caroline, in re-&#xD;
"That of course depends upon my success. ceiving favors from my wife, if she loved me."&#xD;
&#xD;
If I secure a situation, my absence will probably&#xD;
be indefinitely prolonged. I take this step with&#xD;
the less reluctance, Caroline, as I can but feel&#xD;
that my absence will add to your happiness, at&#xD;
least to your peace of mind, and it will cer-&#xD;
tainly be deplored by no one, except perhaps&#xD;
Jenny-poor Jenny !" and his voice faltered a&#xD;
little.&#xD;
As for me, I felt as if my heart were break-&#xD;
ing, and yet I dared give no sign. At last, after&#xD;
a long pause-&#xD;
"Why must you go ?" I asked faintly.&#xD;
More gently than before, he replied-&#xD;
You know, Caroline, I must work for my&#xD;
living, and I can find no work to do here."&#xD;
"There is no hurry, I am sure," I persisted.&#xD;
" As I said before, you can take your own time&#xD;
for finding a place now."&#xD;
He drew himself up haughtily.&#xD;
"Live here a dependent upon your bounty,&#xD;
Caroline?  Ueaven forbid !"&#xD;
"John Ilarrington, I am ashamed of you !"&#xD;
I cried passionately. "When I said something&#xD;
of the same sort to you not long ago, you told&#xD;
me I had insulted you, and now, how dare you&#xD;
suggest such a thing to me!"&#xD;
I think we had better not discuss the sub-&#xD;
ject, Caroline. It can do no good, and you&#xD;
only distress yourself needlessly."&#xD;
his composure frightened me.    Could it&#xD;
lie that lie would really leave me ?&#xD;
"Oh, John !" Icried, "you begged e to be&#xD;
generous, and I was. I sacrificed m11y pride to&#xD;
your wishes, and I have said not a word on the&#xD;
subject since.  Can you not be equally mag-&#xD;
nanimuous ? Whatever our troubles, do not let&#xD;
me feel that a mere despicable money-matter&#xD;
can add to them ! Take the legacy as your&#xD;
own andl use it just as you think best. You&#xD;
/mor that whatever you see fit to do will be sat-&#xD;
isfactory to me.  l)on't refuse me, John ! As&#xD;
you said to me, 'be generous !' "&#xD;
"' The cases are not parallel, Caroline,', he&#xD;
said in a low, hesitating voice. And I, think-&#xD;
ing that he was yielding, continued eagerly-&#xD;
 They are; there can be no difference.&#xD;
You thought it perfectly right that you should&#xD;
* provide for my wants, and why, pray, should I&#xD;
not help you in the same way?"      -&#xD;
In my eagerness, I had advanced to his side,&#xD;
and was gazing into his face as I had not done&#xD;
since our estrangement, lie turned pale.&#xD;
&#xD;
lie 1poved as if he would have taken my&#xD;
hand, and his eyes gazed appealingly into my&#xD;
own.   I turned sick and faint.  I could not, I&#xD;
coudd not give him the'assurance he desired ;&#xD;
1 shook my head and shrank away from his out-&#xD;
stretched hand.  Ie sighed heavily, but his&#xD;
voice was gentle as before when he spoke to me.&#xD;
"You see I shall have to leave you, Caro&#xD;
line."&#xD;
What could I say? lie was only acting as&#xD;
I myself should have done in similar circum-&#xD;
stances. Nay, feeling as he did, I could not&#xD;
wish him to act otherwise.   His honor was&#xD;
mine, and I was proud for him as for myself.&#xD;
So the question was dropped, and from that&#xD;
time the fact of John's speedy departure was&#xD;
considered a settled fact, and only the day was&#xD;
still in abeyance.                 -&#xD;
Just at this time, fortunately perhaps for me,&#xD;
my mind was prevented from brooding over my&#xD;
own private grievances, by the discovery of a&#xD;
new trouble of very different character.&#xD;
Agnes fainted one morning at the breakfast-&#xD;
table.  No unusual symptoms had manifested&#xD;
themselves until, with a faint apology to me,&#xD;
saying that she felt ill, she rose to leave the&#xD;
room. Ere she reached the door she staggered&#xD;
and would have fallen had not John, who had'&#xD;
been watching her very anxiously, sprang for-&#xD;
ward and caught her in his arms.&#xD;
He carried her to her room, and then, while&#xD;
Jenny and I proceeded with the usual remedies&#xD;
for restoring suspended animation, hurried off&#xD;
to call to our assistance the nearest, physician.&#xD;
Before he came, however, the faintness had&#xD;
worn away, and save for her weakness and&#xD;
pallor, she seemed really as well as usual. The&#xD;
doctor, after the usual inquiries, wrote out a&#xD;
simple prescription, advised out-door exercise&#xD;
and cheerful company, and after assuring us&#xD;
that there was really no cause for alarm, with-&#xD;
drew.&#xD;
I followed him to the front door.&#xD;
" You are sure, doctor," I asked anxiously,&#xD;
that there is nothing serious the matter ?"&#xD;
" No physical ailment, madam, that I can&#xD;
discern.  Your sister's system seems much de-&#xD;
bilitatel from some cause or other, but I have&#xD;
every hope that a proper course of treatment&#xD;
will soon remedy that."&#xD;
" rut why,'I persisted, " should her system&#xD;
he debilitated? She has never been ill in her&#xD;

life, and if, as you say, there is no physical ail-&#xD;
ment, what can have occasioned a debility&#xD;
which could produce such alarming results as&#xD;
we this morning have witnessed ?"&#xD;
The doctor answered hesitatingly-&#xD;
"I hardly know, madam, whether I am jus-&#xD;
tified in saying so without a farther acquaint-&#xD;
ance with my patient-but, if my experience is&#xD;
not strangely at fault, it is mental trouble of&#xD;
some kind that is producing all these unpleas-&#xD;
ant symptoms."&#xD;
"Mental trouble ; impossible !'' I cried,&#xD;
aghast at the idea.&#xD;
"\Well, perhaps not," answered the gentle-&#xD;
man, evidently afraid of compromising himself&#xD;
by persisting in the statement. " I may possi-&#xD;
bly be mistaken ; I shall be able to judge better&#xD;
upon a second visit," and then with a polite&#xD;
bow the doctor took his departure.&#xD;
I returned to the sitting-room to relieve the&#xD;
minds of John and Eddie, who were anxiously&#xD;
waiting td hear the doctor's opinion concerning&#xD;
Agnes. Jenny, too, came down the stairs at&#xD;
the same moment, reporting the  ient to be&#xD;
apparently quite recovered.  I g ye to them&#xD;
the doctor's assurance that there was nothing&#xD;
serious the matter, reserving from them, how-&#xD;
ever, for evident reasons, the farther opinion he&#xD;
had given ; then I hastened to return to Agnes.&#xD;
I was more disturbed by what I had heard,&#xD;
than I was willing to confess even to myself.&#xD;
Though to the doctor I had denied all possibility&#xD;
of mental trouble for my little sister, I was by&#xD;
no means so certain myself on that point as I'&#xD;
could have wished to be. That there had been&#xD;
a misunderstanding between her and Eddie I&#xD;
was very certain, but that her feelings were so&#xD;
deeply interested in the matter, that it should&#xD;
actually have undermined her health, I would&#xD;
not believe. Bitterly did I reproach myself,&#xD;
however, for not having possessed myself of her&#xD;
confidence, and so have been able to have rem-&#xD;
edied the trouble before it had proceeded to so&#xD;
alarming an extent. I hurried to her room, de-&#xD;
termined at once to know how far the doctor&#xD;
had been right in his suspicions.&#xD;
If I had had any doubts as to the propriety&#xD;
of this course of action, they would have been&#xD;
at once put to flight by my discovering when I&#xD;
entered the room that Agnes was weeping bit-&#xD;
terly. When she first saw me she endeavored&#xD;
to repress her tears and conceal her emotion,&#xD;
but the very effort in her present feeble state&#xD;
hut produced a contrary effect, and for a few&#xD;
moments hem' grief was almost hysterical.&#xD;
" My child ! my darling ! what is all this ?"&#xD;
I cried, soothing her excited nerves with all the&#xD;
&#xD;
REVELATIONS.                             95&#xD;
endearing appellations and tender caresses a&#xD;
mother could have showered upon a weeping&#xD;
child. " Speak to me, dearest; tell me what&#xD;
it is that has thus distressed you."&#xD;
She clung to me in a perfect passion of grief.&#xD;
" I wanted to tell you," she sobbed, "you&#xD;
know I have, all along.  I have tried to, a&#xD;
hundred times, but you would not let me, and&#xD;
now-"    She could speak no more.&#xD;
"And now, my own precious sister, you shall&#xD;
tell me every thing, and I will listen to you and&#xD;
try to help you, and share your troubles, even&#xD;
if I can not cure them," I said, scarcely less af-&#xD;
fected than she was herself, for my conscience&#xD;
told me that her charge was but too true. I&#xD;
hid repelled her confidence, and even now,&#xD;
though I felt that for her own sake I must let&#xD;
her unveil her heart before me, 1 could form no&#xD;
idea of what I ought to say or do to console her.&#xD;
Encourage her feelings toward Eddie Harring-&#xD;
ton I dare not, uncertain as I had lately be-&#xD;
come of his sentiments for her, and to dis-&#xD;
courage them would, perhaps, in her present ex-&#xD;
cited state, be still more dangerous.&#xD;
When she had become a little calmer, I said&#xD;
to her-&#xD;
"And now, dear, tell me what it is all about,&#xD;
and let me see if I can not find some way to&#xD;
make you happier."&#xD;
" Oh ! you know, Caroline, you know. I am&#xD;
sure there is no need for me to tell you; you&#xD;
must have seen long before you were taken sick&#xD;
that-that--I loved him." And her voice sank&#xD;
to a whisper, and the sweet face that leaned&#xD;
upon my shoulder was suffused with rosy&#xD;
blushes.&#xD;
"I am afraid that I did, Agnes ; or at least&#xD;
I fancied I saw that he loved you, though I&#xD;
must confess, my darling, that I had no idea&#xD;
your feelings for him were any thing like so&#xD;
vivid as this day's events have proved them to&#xD;
be. But tell me, what has been the cause of&#xD;
your misunderstanding? You forget that I am&#xD;
quite in the dark in regard to that."&#xD;
She raised her head from my shoulder and&#xD;
gazed at me in unfeigned amazement.&#xD;
" Why, Caro !  Of course it has only been&#xD;
on account of the hard feeling between John&#xD;
and him. Frank and I have had no misunder-&#xD;
standing whatever."&#xD;
"Frank and you !" I cried, echoing her&#xD;
words in blank astonishment. "Why, Agnes,&#xD;
is it not Eddie IHarrington whom you love ?"&#xD;
"Oh, Caro ! surely you never thought that!I"&#xD;
she said in a voice in which contempjt, indigna-&#xD;
tion, arnd amazement were curiously mingled.&#xD;
" Eddie Harrington, indeed ! I never liked him&#xD;

&#xD;
much at the best of times, and since you were&#xD;
taken ill he has grown to be absolutely insup-&#xD;
portable."&#xD;
"And can it be possible that you have loved&#xD;
Frank 1\ettleby all this time, and I have never&#xD;
suspected it ?" I cried, still incredulous, and&#xD;
again the blushing face drooped upon my&#xD;
shoulder as she murmured-&#xD;
"how could you help seeing it? I thought&#xD;
of course you knew."&#xD;
"And he-does Frank love you?    I mean,&#xD;
has he told you so ?"&#xD;
" Oh, yes !' was the whispered response,&#xD;
" ever since the night of that little party in his&#xD;
rooms. Miss Jenny guessed what I felt, 1&#xD;
know, for she walked off with Eddie that night&#xD;
and let Frank take inc home, and it was com-&#xD;
ing home that he told me. He asked me to be&#xD;
his wife, and I told him yes, if you were will-&#xD;
ing, Caro, you and John."&#xD;
"And I was never told of this, Agnes," I&#xD;
said a little reproachfully. " Have I deserved&#xD;
Switch treatment ?"&#xD;
" Indeed, indeed, I could not help it ; don't&#xD;
yon renienber the day after the party you were&#xD;
ill ? and the next iiwas the commencement of&#xD;
your fever.  I had not the slightest chance to&#xD;
tell you then, and sitice that you-you wouldn't&#xD;
let 1m10."&#xD;
how blind, how incredibly blind had I been !&#xD;
Even yet I could not believe that all the fanci-&#xD;
'ul fabric I had been rearing since Eddie liar-&#xD;
riington's return was- absolutely without founda-&#xD;
tiom .&#xD;
And you really never cared for Eddie at&#xD;
all?" I alked.&#xD;
"I can't bear him," she rejoined pettishly,&#xD;
Biut surely, Agnes, I cani not have been de-&#xD;
ceived in thinking that he loves you ? Poor&#xD;
boy !  le has been sharper-sighted than I, and&#xD;
thk, then, is the cause of his constant melan-&#xD;
eliolv."&#xD;
Agnes laughed outright.&#xD;
"Oh, you foolish, foolit Caro! What fun&#xD;
it would be if his learned lordship could hear&#xD;
vou. I think it would ruffle his imperturbability&#xD;
if any thing could. What youhave been think-&#xD;
ing about I can not imagine, but Frank and I&#xD;
saw how matters stood long, long ago. Edwin&#xD;
llarrington cares more for one of your raven&#xD;
tresses than he does for poor foolish me, body&#xD;
and soul."&#xD;
I colored with indignation.&#xD;
"Hush! Agnes, you forget the impropriety&#xD;
of such language when addressed to ime. Tih&#xD;
affection which I have no doubt liy hiusband't&#xD;
brother really feels for me, is too sacred an eamo&#xD;
&#xD;
tion to be made the subject of such indelicate&#xD;
remarks. But we have strangely wandered from&#xD;
our original theme. You have not yet told me&#xD;
what it is that has changed my blithe Agnes into&#xD;
the sorrowful maiden who so lately wept upon&#xD;
my breast ?"&#xD;
The bright face was again overshadowed.&#xD;
"There is nothing that you can not guess&#xD;
without my telling you. You know how angry&#xD;
John is with Frank. Well, Frank is just as&#xD;
much displeased with John. He says that&#xD;
John has insulted him so grievously, that even&#xD;
for my sake he can never come beneath his roof&#xD;
again. He calls John such dreadful names, and&#xD;
seems so determined never to be friends with&#xD;
him again, that it makes me wretched to hear,&#xD;
him. And then I get to see him so seldom&#xD;
now. He can not come here, and, of course,&#xD;
Caroline, I would not go anywhere to meet&#xD;
him. And so it ha been only by chance that I&#xD;
could see him at all, and it makes him so im-&#xD;
patient and angry that he hardly seems like his&#xD;
old self. And oh ! sister, lie has been urging&#xD;
me lately to marry hit right away--not to tell&#xD;
John any thing about it, but I would not to that&#xD;
for the world.  See here, this is what has&#xD;
troubled me so this morning," and slipping her&#xD;
hand beneath her pillow, she drew forth a note&#xD;
which she handed to me.&#xD;
" Frank met me at church last evening, and&#xD;
walked home with me. He gave me this note&#xD;
to give to you, and lie says that this must decide&#xD;
it all, for if you will not consent, and I will not&#xD;
give up John Harrington, I must give up him.&#xD;
I have been so miserable, you can't imagine,&#xD;
Caro. I almost wished this morning that the&#xD;
doctor might say I was going to die. I did not&#xD;
know what I ought to do. I was afraid to give&#xD;
you the note. He talks so dreadfully of John,&#xD;
that I was sure you would be more angry with&#xD;
him than ever. I am sure I can not guess how&#xD;
all this terrible quarreling has come about."&#xD;
And as she finished her incoherient speech, I&#xD;
was again obliged to resume my own burden of&#xD;
woe, which in the interest I had taken in her&#xD;
story I had for the moment laid down. A fierce&#xD;
anger against Frank Nettleby filled my soul.&#xD;
How dared he blacken my husband's fame in&#xD;
the eyes of this innocent girl! Against her at&#xD;
least John Harrington had never sinned, and it&#xD;
was cruel, wickedly cruel, to try to turn her&#xD;
&#xD;
heart away from him.&#xD;
I was careful however to disguise this feeling&#xD;
from  Agnes, aisd opening the note, I read as&#xD;
e follows:&#xD;
s 1 v PAs usM. laSitH AneeoTo-My dear friend may I&#xD;
- not call you ?-ffor such most fondly do I hope that you will&#xD;
&#xD;
prove to be to me--Again do you see me before you in the&#xD;
igtit of a nuiter. God giant that I may now be :More suc-&#xD;
cesifut than I was of yore-"&#xD;
"He told me all about your having been his&#xD;
first love, Caro," interpolated Agnes, as she read&#xD;
the note over my shoulder, "but I don't mind&#xD;
it in the least now."&#xD;

he has myself, and knowing this, you cannot deny me your&#xD;

may I not call upon you, and in person plead my cause? I&#xD;
had sworn that I would never set foot within John Har-&#xD;
rington's doors again, but even that humiliation Iwillde-&#xD;
scend to, rather than endure longer this maddening sus-&#xD;
peise. Write me, I beseech you, if only a single tine, and&#xD;
tell me when and where I can see you, and by so doing&#xD;
command forever the gratitude, as you have always pos.&#xD;
sessed the admiration and respectful esteem of&#xD;
"FRAnK NETTLIrY."&#xD;
"Do tell me, Caro, what has been the cause&#xD;
of this dreadful misunderstanding ?" said Agnes&#xD;
pleadingly.    "Frank will not, though I have&#xD;
almost quarreled with him      in begging him    to&#xD;
do so, and I only stopped questioning him be-&#xD;
cause he said that it would not be proper for me&#xD;
to hear.   And yet you know       all about it, it&#xD;
seems. Do tell me, Caro ?"&#xD;
"Frank was quite right.     The story is not fit&#xD;
for you to hear, so I certainly shall not inform&#xD;
you of it," I said, rising to leave the room, for&#xD;
the shame and agony which overpowered me I&#xD;
could not hope much longer to coirceal.&#xD;
"At least," she cried, catching my dress to&#xD;
detain me, ''tell me this muach--I must know,&#xD;
indeed I must !-Was it Frank's fault?         Is it&#xD;
any thing he has done?"&#xD;
Justice both to Frank and to her demanded&#xD;
that I should speak, though I felt as if I would&#xD;
rather have died than done so.&#xD;
"No !" I said,"Frank is not in the least to&#xD;
blame." And the miserable confession wrung&#xD;
from me, I rushed to my own room, there in its&#xD;
friendly solitude to weep the bitterest tears that&#xD;
outraged pride and wounded love ever wrung&#xD;
from woman's tortured heart.,_&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
EDDIE iAIRINGTON' PASSION.&#xD;
IT was only after a severe struggle with my-&#xD;
self that I could bring my mind to the task of&#xD;
writing to Frank Nettleby. I could not do so&#xD;
without virtually acknowledgii my husband's&#xD;
crime, and the justice of Frank's opinion of him.&#xD;
Yet for Agnes's sake it must be done. My hiap-&#xD;
piness was wrecked, but hers I still could se-&#xD;
cure, and I must do so at whatever cost to my~&#xD;
self.&#xD;
"After all," I murmured bitterly, "' the true&#xD;
shame and disgrace consist in the crime itself,&#xD;
not in its being known to Frank Nettlehv."&#xD;
When I was cahiii enough to bring my iud&#xD;
to the task, I descended to the dining-room for&#xD;
the purpose of answering the note.' My own&#xD;
desk was deficient in some article of stationery&#xD;
.that I needed, so I seated myself at John's es-&#xD;
critoire to write.&#xD;
I re-read Frank's letter.  There was much&#xD;
in it that had wounded me cruelly, yet upon a&#xD;
re-perusal, I could but feel grateful for the&#xD;
lenient manner in which my luusband's criie&#xD;
had been alluded to, and though "ridiculous"&#xD;
seemed to me a strangely inappropriate adjee-&#xD;
tive to apply to a midnight burglary and an at--&#xD;
tempt to murder, yet I was too thankful for the&#xD;
delicacy that spared my feelings by avoiding&#xD;
harsher language, to quarel with the words that&#xD;
had been used. I hesitated for a long time how&#xD;
to address my new correspondent ; his newly-dis-&#xD;
covered relations to Agnes had given mite a right&#xD;
to express the sisterly affection I had'long felt for&#xD;
him, so after much reflection, I wrote ts follows:&#xD;
DeAR FRANK--For dear you are and ong alvie been t&#xD;
mue, scarcely more co now than heretofore, though to-day 1&#xD;
learn, for the first time, that sim soon to claim you for a&#xD;

and myself. with'warmest wis es for your myeappine&#xD;
believe me, your friend,  Usnowisse htIiARuli(i)ON."&#xD;
As I penned the last word, a heavy hamndh was&#xD;
laid upon my shoulder. With a startled cry,&#xD;
for I had been so absorbed in my occ ulation&#xD;
that I had heard no one approach me, I turned,&#xD;
and beheld my husband. his face was tbso-&#xD;
lutely livid with rage, and his eyes glared upon&#xD;
me like those of a maniac, while the hand that&#xD;
rested upon my shoulder grasped me so forcibly&#xD;
as to catso me actual pain.&#xD;
" In Heaven's name, what is the matter wih&#xD;
you?'' I cried, terribly frightened by his strange&#xD;
dhemeanomr.&#xD;
&#xD;
MY HUSBAND'S CRIME.&#xD;
&#xD;

MY HUSBAND'S CRIME.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You dare-you dare-to write to that man!"&#xD;
lie gasped, in a voice hoarse and inarticulate&#xD;
with passion.&#xD;
"Yes! I do dare," I cried, wresting myself&#xD;
from his grasp, indignant at the tone lie assumed&#xD;
to me. " I an sure I can not conceive why you&#xD;
should hate Frank Nettleby so bitterly. At all&#xD;
events Iwill not visit upon his head a fault that&#xD;
has been wholly yours."&#xD;
Beware ! Caroline, beware !" lie said, his&#xD;
voice trembling with illy-repressed passion.&#xD;
"There is a point beyond which endurance&#xD;
must give way.   In my great love for you I&#xD;
have borne and forborne more than mortal man&#xD;
ever did before. But if I have pitied rather than&#xD;
condemned, it has only been because I have be-&#xD;
lieved you an innocent, even though a tried and&#xD;
tempted woman. What must I think of you now,&#xD;
when, knowing your own frailty, you dare sit&#xD;
down in my house to pen your infamous letters&#xD;
to that more infamous man ?"&#xD;
I stared at him in terrified amazement. The&#xD;
anger seemed so disproportionate to the offense,&#xD;
that I could account for it in no other way than&#xD;
by believing his brain was affected.&#xD;
" How long have you been carrying on this&#xD;
clandestine intercourse ?" lie furiously con-&#xD;
tinued.&#xD;
"Upon my word ! John IHarrington," I said,&#xD;
as soon as I could find breath to speak, "I be-&#xD;
lieve you have taken leave of your senses. I don't&#xD;
know what you mean by 'clandestine inter-&#xD;
course.' Frank wrote to me yesterday a mes-&#xD;
sage, chiefly concerning Agnes, certainly an af-&#xD;
fair which is no business of yours, and I have&#xD;
answered him as I saw fit, and I do not choose to&#xD;
consider myself accountable to you for the man-&#xD;
ner in which I have treated my sister's private&#xD;
aflhiirs."&#xD;
"A lie! a lie! a base unwomanly lie ! In&#xD;
the very face of that letter, in which mine own&#xD;
eyes have read the confession of your guilty&#xD;
love, you would fabricate this false story con-&#xD;
cerning your sister to impose afresh upon my&#xD;
credulity," and he pointed to the letter I had&#xD;
just written, and my eyes following the direc-&#xD;
tion of his hand, I read the first line of the letter,&#xD;
"1 )ear Frank-For dear you are and long have&#xD;
been to me-"&#xD;
&#xD;
I stood like one awaking from a troubled&#xD;
dream. Catching up both the letters, I thrust&#xD;
them into his hands.&#xD;
" What monstrous thought have you been&#xD;
entertaining!  Read the letters ; read them&#xD;
both, and then tell me, if you can, what there is&#xD;
in them so terribly to excite you."&#xD;
lie needed no second bidding. Passionately&#xD;
&#xD;
he tore open poor Frank's uncomplimentary&#xD;
note. He read first that and then my answer,&#xD;
and then again turning to Frank's letter, read it&#xD;
through the second time. As lie finished, the&#xD;
papers dropped from his trembling hands. He&#xD;
leaned against the wall, white and exhausted.&#xD;
A stupid, bewildered look was in his eyes, and&#xD;
he spoke like one asleep-&#xD;
"I-don't-understand. Caroline, what does&#xD;
it mean?"&#xD;
''It means just what those letters say. Frank&#xD;
Nettleby has proposed for Agnes, and I have&#xD;
given my consent to their marriage."&#xD;
"And you," he continued, in that same&#xD;
strangely bewildered tone-" Have you so far&#xD;
conquered your love for him that you can write&#xD;
to him thus coolly concerning his union with&#xD;
another ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
My cheeks were scarlet with indignation, and&#xD;
in a voice choked with shame and anger I an-&#xD;
swered-&#xD;
" How could I conquer a passion that I never&#xD;
felt? You know I never loved Frank Nettleby."&#xD;
A sudden change passed over his face. His&#xD;
cheeks flushed, his eyes gleamed with triumph-&#xD;
ant lustre.&#xD;
"Say it again, Caroline ! tell me once more.&#xD;
I can not believe it. This sudden joy has al-&#xD;
most crazed me. Tell me again that you do&#xD;
not love that man."&#xD;
"Would I have rejected him when he asked&#xD;
me to become his wife, if I had loved him?&#xD;
Would I have married you, if to him I had&#xD;
given my heart? And as to loving him since&#xD;
-loving him now-oh, John ! how can you in-&#xD;
sult me by so base a thought !" And over-&#xD;
powered with grief and vexation, I buried my&#xD;
face in my hands, and cried for very shame.&#xD;
He threw himself on his knees by my side,&#xD;
and cast his arms around me, while vainly I&#xD;
sought to disengage myself from his embrace.&#xD;
"My love ! my wife ! what is it then that has&#xD;
come between us? If tso other man has won&#xD;
your heart, why do you no longer love me ?"&#xD;
I ceased my struggles to escape from him,&#xD;
and turned to look him in the face, indignant&#xD;
at his audacity.  I turned and met those&#xD;
loving, beseeching eyes, whose counterpart had&#xD;
once looked up at me from the face of my little&#xD;
child-those eyes, whose loving light had once&#xD;
been dearer to me than hope of heaven itself-&#xD;
and wild with grief and passion, I started to my&#xD;
feet and tore myself from his encircling arms.&#xD;
I trembled for myself. My courage, my pride&#xD;
was failing me. Another glance into that ten-&#xD;
der, beseeching face, and I should have forgot-&#xD;
ten all--all, save that I loved him.&#xD;

MY HUSBAND'S CRIME.&#xD;
&#xD;
words and manner in the horrible idea they&#xD;
suggested to my mind.&#xD;
"What do you mean? What has passed be-&#xD;
tween you and John ?"&#xD;
"lie cane to my office an hour ago in the&#xD;
most violent fury I ever saw a human being&#xD;
give way to. I was alone as it chanced, and he&#xD;
forthwith commenced showering upon me the&#xD;
most abusive epithets that one man can apply&#xD;
to another.  I was a traitor, and had betrayed&#xD;
my nearest and dearest ties; I was a spy, and&#xD;
had crept into his family but to create suspicion&#xD;
and disturbance; I was a villain, who, from the&#xD;
best of motives, had won from him the heart&#xD;
of his wife, and had brought endless disgrace&#xD;
upon my father's name.  In short, all that man&#xD;
could conceive of crime and vileness, he ac-&#xD;
catsed me of being guilty of; and for your&#xD;
sake, Caroline, I bore it in silence. I could&#xD;
iiot exonerate myself without accusing you,&#xD;
and rather than do that, had lie then and there&#xD;
raised his hand against my life, I should have&#xD;
died and made no sign. My silence infuriated&#xD;
him mnore than the angriest responses could&#xD;
have done ; lie would have laid violent hands&#xD;
upon rie had I not thrown open the window&#xD;
that looked upon the streets, and given himn to&#xD;
uiderstaid itlint if lie approached a foot nearer&#xD;
to me, I would suimon the police to my assist-&#xD;
wnce. This I could readily do, as he knew,&#xD;
and in imupotenit rage lie finally left me, swear-&#xD;
ing that lie would be bitterly revenged cre&#xD;
twenty-four hours had passed over our heads.&#xD;
And he will keep his word, Caroline," con-&#xD;
tinued the young man, tremibliing with feverish&#xD;
excitement, while I, white with horror, listened&#xD;
to the terrible recital. ''lie had no weapon&#xD;
about his person when he was in the office, or&#xD;
1 should not now be alire to tell this tale ; buit&#xD;
he will return again to the attack better pre-&#xD;
pared to wreak his vengeance upon my devoted&#xD;
head.  What shall I do ? advise me. If you&#xD;
fail me in this extremity, I am lost indeed."&#xD;
My horror was merging into incredulity; the&#xD;
situation which he depicted was so dreadful&#xD;
that it seemed impossible.&#xD;
' There is some mistake here, surely !" I&#xD;
said.  " You have been so excited yourself,&#xD;
Eddie, that your fear has overpowered your&#xD;
reason. However angry and violent John may&#xD;
have been, 1 can not think there is the least&#xD;
danger of his doing you any personal injury-"&#xD;
He interrupted me.&#xD;
"t I swear to you, Caroline, that what I have&#xD;
said to von is the unexaggerated truth. Can&#xD;
yon think that the mere base fear of death&#xD;
could have thus excited me ? I am no cow ard;&#xD;
&#xD;
poorly as you may think of me, could my death&#xD;
bring happiness to you, I would stir not hand&#xD;
or foot to save my life. It is for your sake-&#xD;
yours and John's only-that I have felt the&#xD;
terror which you seem to think has overpower-&#xD;
ed my reason."&#xD;
"I can not-I can not believe it !" I cried,&#xD;
half crazy between doubt and fear.  " John&#xD;
Ilarrington's hand upraised against his broth-&#xD;
er's life ! It is impossible. You are putting&#xD;
both yourself and inc to useless pain. I know&#xD;
that you are deceived."&#xD;
"Caroline," said Eddie, in a tone that made&#xD;
me shudder, "you do not know John Harring-&#xD;
ton as I know him. Be warned before it is too&#xD;
late. Could any thing but the most direct ev-&#xD;
idence have convinced you that once before,&#xD;
for far less provocation than he this time imag-&#xD;
ines himself to have received, lie raised his&#xD;
hand .against a fellow-creature's life? Do you&#xD;
know why lie is now so angry with me ? It is&#xD;
not because he believes me to have betrayed&#xD;
his trust-it is because he believes that you love&#xD;
me."&#xD;
His voice had sunk almost to a whisper as he&#xD;
spoke the last few words, but as I hoard them,&#xD;
the last lingering hope fled from my mind.&#xD;
The violent anger which John's jealousy had&#xD;
caused him to exhibit against Frank Nettleby,&#xD;
and which I myself had witnessed, made me&#xD;
realize with an agony of fear the danger which&#xD;
might really exist, had he now taken it into his&#xD;
head to be jealous of Eddie. In the former in-&#xD;
stance he had little or no cause for suspicion,&#xD;
and " trifles light as air" it had indeed been&#xD;
that had then aroused his fury. But in regard&#xD;
to Eddie it was far different. As I looked back&#xD;
over the past year, and remembered how strong&#xD;
a partiality I had always shown for the boy,&#xD;
and how careless I had been in concealing the&#xD;
fact, showing, too, that there was a secret be-&#xD;
tween us, which a jealous man might easily&#xD;
have suspected to have been a guilty one-when&#xD;
I thought of all this, I felt as if my senses were&#xD;
deserting me-that Eddie was indeed right in&#xD;
his belief that his life was in danger.&#xD;
"Fly !" I cried, starting to my feet. " You&#xD;
must not stay here a moment longer.  Leave&#xD;
the house!  Leave time city!  Hide yourself&#xD;
anywhere from this unhappy man. My God!&#xD;
what will become of us all !  Why was I ever&#xD;
born for such a miserable fate ! Why do you&#xD;
tarry? Do you not know that your brother&#xD;
may return at any moment?   Go ! Do go, I&#xD;
beseech y'ou !&#xD;
He toe had risen to his feet, and in my wild,&#xD;
unthinking terror, I had laid my clasped hands&#xD;

&#xD;
you will not undeceive him upon this point for&#xD;
twenty-four hours at least. Will you promise&#xD;
me?   Remember, I am but asking of you a re-&#xD;
newal of the pledge you formerly gave me, and&#xD;
which you have so grievously wronged me by&#xD;
violating even in part."&#xD;
This was true, and as I could see no possible&#xD;
objection to renewing the promise for that lim-&#xD;
ited time, I said so, and promised as he wished.&#xD;
"Farewell, then," he said, extending his&#xD;
hand. "We perhaps shall never meet again ;&#xD;
at least let us part friends."&#xD;
Very reluctantly I gave him my hand, and he&#xD;
retained it with close pressure, spite of the un-&#xD;
easy efforts I made to withdraw it.&#xD;
"Good-bye! Mr. Harrington," I said. "I&#xD;
shall try to forget this day's occurrences, and&#xD;
remember you only as the friend you have hith-&#xD;
erto proved to me."&#xD;
"And that is all!" he said. "No sympathy&#xD;
-no good wishes-not a single tear ! Yet this&#xD;
is the woman for whom I have sacrificed every&#xD;
hope of my life ; the only creature on God's&#xD;
earth I ever loved-the only one I ever shall&#xD;
love. I will not be so vilely defrauded ! If I&#xD;
have sold my birthright for a mess of pottage,&#xD;
shall that paltry pittance be denied me?  By&#xD;
Heaven ! no !" And before I could guess his&#xD;
intention, he had caught me in his arms, and&#xD;
bending over me, kissed- me twice upon the&#xD;
mouth, passionate, fiery kisses, that brought the&#xD;
.blood in torrents to my face and neck. Then,&#xD;
as suddenly, he released me, and ere I had re-&#xD;
covered my senses sufficiently to comprehend&#xD;
the insult I had received, I heard the street door&#xD;
slam behind him, and Edwin Harrington had&#xD;
left his brother's house forever.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
JOHN HARRINoTON S EXPLANATIONS .&#xD;
IT was a fortunate thing for me in the present&#xD;
excited state of my nerves, that I had no leisure&#xD;
to ponder over the bewildering events of the&#xD;
day. Active exertion did more toward re-&#xD;
storing my mind to an even balance, than could&#xD;
any other remedy have done. Sarah had not&#xD;
yet resumed her sceptre, and I still was con-&#xD;
sidered responsible for the smooth and regular&#xD;
working of the household machinery. Know-&#xD;
ing therefore that supper must be prepared,-and&#xD;
that there was no one but myself to prepare it,&#xD;
I was perforce obliged to exert myself, and the&#xD;
effort brought with it its own reward. Common&#xD;
sense returned to mc while fulfilling my homely&#xD;
domestic duties, atid the utter absurdity of the&#xD;
&#xD;
melodramatic fears which Edwin Harrington's&#xD;
words and looks had conjured up, became very&#xD;
clearly apparent. The idea of Johni larring-&#xD;
ton--the sober, self-contained "governor" of&#xD;
former days -my quiet, matter-of-fact hts-&#xD;
band--lurking about the streets of Boston with&#xD;
concealed weapons, ready to fall at any moment&#xD;
with deadly onslaught upon his helpless brothi-&#xD;
er, was so utterly and entirely unnatural, that,&#xD;
spite of some very singular circumstantial evi-&#xD;
dence, that would obtrusiiely present itself to&#xD;
my mind, I dismissed the thought determinedly&#xD;
and successfully.&#xD;
Jenny's entrance, too, upon her return from&#xD;
her daily labors, aided greatly in restoring ni&#xD;
to composure. The overwrought feelings and&#xD;
excited passions which I had been suffering&#xD;
from in myself and others, were so utterly at&#xD;
variance with her sharp, cheery voice, nid sitm-&#xD;
ple, unaffected ways, that they could not exist&#xD;
in her presence.  Bewildered and uneasy as I&#xD;
could but be, I still, under the influence of her&#xD;
society and my own occupations, rapidly set-&#xD;
tled my mind into a tolerable state of compos-&#xD;
ure.&#xD;
" You need not wait tea for Eddie," she said,&#xD;
as she entered the kitchen.  ''l1e caine to me&#xD;
just as I was leaving the store, and told mue that&#xD;
he was about to leave the city. Sonic business&#xD;
;or one of his clients, I believe. At all events,&#xD;
he bade sae good-bye very affectionately, and&#xD;
said he would write to me from New York, tell-&#xD;
ing me when to look for him back again."&#xD;
Poor Miss Jenny! Who was to tell her that&#xD;
"her boy," as she so often called him, had&#xD;
gone from  her, not for days or weeks, but for&#xD;
years, perhaps forever ? I would not, certainly.&#xD;
lie should tell of his own sins if they must be&#xD;
made known to her, for from no words of mine&#xD;
should she learn the shameful story of that day's&#xD;
proceedings.  Eddie Harrington had passed&#xD;
from my life forever ; at least a hoped co. Yet&#xD;
not the lightest of my many tr"oubles was the&#xD;
thought of the sorrow that was brewing for my&#xD;
sister-in-law, and I could not altogether rid my&#xD;
conscience of an uneasy feeling that I was par-&#xD;
tially responsible for it.&#xD;
Agnes had by this time joined us. "A little&#xD;
weak and shaky," she informed us, but feeling&#xD;
otherwise more than usually well and cheerful.&#xD;
And after waiting more than half an hour be-&#xD;
yond the usual supper-time, and John not re-&#xD;
turning, we three women took our places at the&#xD;
meal without him.&#xD;
" Howa long does he expect to be away?"&#xD;
asked Agnes inidiffer-enitly, when informed bsy&#xD;
Jenny of Eddie's departure.&#xD;

"lie did not say ; only a few days, I sup-&#xD;
pose, though he kissed me good-bye as affection-&#xD;
ately as if he expected to be gone for years.&#xD;
how fond he is of me, the foolish boy ! I don't&#xD;
believe he will ever learn to act and feel like a&#xD;
man." .&#xD;
"He may well love you, Jenny," I said, with&#xD;
quivering voice, for I saw a deeper meaning in&#xD;
that earnest farewell than was apparent to his&#xD;
unconscious sister. " I should think but very&#xD;
lightly of his heart if he could leave you without&#xD;
some signs of emotion-even-I added some-&#xD;
what hastily--" even for a few days."&#xD;
"It has always amused me," said Agnes,&#xD;
laughing, ''to hear you two women talk of Ed-&#xD;
win as you do. To hear you, any one would&#xD;
suppose that lie was some bashful, unsophistica-&#xD;
ted boy of eighteen, instead of being, as he is, a&#xD;
man wise enough, if not old enough, to outwit&#xD;
you both."&#xD;
" How old is Edwin, Jenny ?" I asked, sud-&#xD;
denly prompted to the question by a strange&#xD;
suspicion that flashed that moment into my&#xD;
uiind.&#xD;
"Why, hardly know ; let me see," she said&#xD;
pensively.  " Twenty-three or four ; twenty-&#xD;
live, may be."&#xD;
" Nonsense ! Miss Jenny," said Agnes, a lit-&#xD;
tle tartly. "lie is twenty-eight.  I saw the&#xD;
record of his birth in the big Bible you keep on&#xD;
your table, upi stairs."&#xD;
" Well, my dear," Miss Jenny said placidly,&#xD;
not a whit ruffled by the contradiction, " perhaps,&#xD;
you are right. It only seems to ie the other&#xD;
day, however, that he was a little fellow no&#xD;
higher than my shoulder, and it is hard to be-&#xD;
lieve the time has flown so quickly. I believe&#xD;
I was mistaken, though ; let me see-lie was&#xD;
born in 18--, yes ! that makes him twenty-eight,&#xD;
sure enough. Who would have thought it,&#xD;
though !'&#xD;
"Not many persons, that is true," replied&#xD;
Agnes. "IIe is certainly the youngest-looking&#xD;
lerson for his age I ever saw. But there is&#xD;
nothing of the boy about him except his face,&#xD;
you may take my word for that."&#xD;
Sharp-sighted  Agnes!  Where had    she&#xD;
learned the wisdom that I had so utterly failed&#xD;
to acquire ? I said nothing, while the two&#xD;
chatted on, but the information I had just re-&#xD;
ceived gave me fresh food for thought. How&#xD;
moy cheeks tingled when Iremembered the man-&#xD;
ner in which I had conducted myself toward&#xD;
Edwin Ilarrington ever since I hatd known him !&#xD;
It was small wonder that he, a man several&#xD;
years my senior, should have easily misunder--&#xD;
stood the condescension, the petting, the fa-&#xD;
&#xD;
ND'S CRIME.&#xD;
miliar freedom with which I had uniformly&#xD;
treated him. What could he have thought the&#xD;
occasion of it, except an undue interest in him-&#xD;
self? I could have cried froh shame at the re-&#xD;
membrance of my own folly. And with the&#xD;
sound of his dishonorable words still ringing in&#xD;
my ears, the fire of those insulting kisses still&#xD;
burning on my lips, I marveled indeed that I&#xD;
could ever have been so deluded.&#xD;
I followed Agnes to her own room when she&#xD;
retired that night.&#xD;
"I want you to explain to me one portion of&#xD;
your love affairs that has mystified me not a lit-&#xD;
tle," I said to her, after first telling her of the&#xD;
letter I had written to Frank, and setting her&#xD;
mind completely at rest in regard to her own&#xD;
future, so far as it lay in my power to influence&#xD;
it. "I still can not understand how it is that&#xD;
I was led so completely astray from the very&#xD;
beginning, in thinking that you and Eddie were&#xD;
lovers. I certainly had good grounds for my&#xD;
belief at one time, for you were always talking&#xD;
and whispering together at the most unseemly&#xD;
times and places. I came upon you accident-&#xD;
ally many times, to find him talking earnestly&#xD;
and fervently, and you blushing and confused ;&#xD;
and you would start away from him at my ap-&#xD;
proach, shrinking from notice with every mark&#xD;
of confusion. Now, pray tell me, if this conduct&#xD;
was not caused by love, what did cause it ?"&#xD;
'-It was caused by love," replied the girl,&#xD;
laughing and blushing, " but not love for him,&#xD;
my dear sister, I assure you. In those days he&#xD;
used to be forever teasing me aboutFrank, whom&#xD;
I had already begun to think a great deal of-&#xD;
He used to always have some long tale to tell&#xD;
inc of something Frank had said about me, how&#xD;
much ie admired me, and all such nonsense,&#xD;
and I liked to listen to it all very well, for of&#xD;
course I believed it, though Frank has told me&#xD;
since that it was all fabrication from beginning&#xD;
to end, and that he never talked to Edwin lar-&#xD;
rington or to any one else about his feelings for&#xD;
me, until he had talked to me first. Do you&#xD;
know, I used to have an idea then, that Master&#xD;
Eddie wanted to make you believe he was in&#xD;
love with me?  I had no idea what his object&#xD;
was, and I haven't now, either.  Perhaps it&#xD;
was all imagination on my part, but there is one&#xD;
tIring certain, Caro, though I know you won't&#xD;
believe it: Eddie Harrington is not nearly so in-&#xD;
nocent as he tries to make people believe. He&#xD;
is a real, downright humbug, that is what I&#xD;
think of him, ansd I hsavo often wondered how&#xD;
any one so clever as you are, can he so deceived&#xD;
by him."'  .&#xD;
|Oh, wise, wise Agnes!I Was not I growing&#xD;
&#xD;
EDDIE HARRINGTON'S PASSION.&#xD;
&#xD;
105&#xD;
&#xD;
every moment more ready to confess that my nated forever the intimacy between Edwin lHar-&#xD;
experience had at length taught me what your rington and myself. Not an insult which 1&#xD;
&#xD;
maiden instincts had so long ago discovered?&#xD;
However, I did not deem it expedient to en-&#xD;
lighten her as to my present opinion, so after a&#xD;
little more chat, I bade her good-night and&#xD;
sought my own apartment.&#xD;
It was some time after I had gone to bed be-&#xD;
fore John came home. Since our quarrel, he&#xD;
had occupied the room adjoining mine, and I&#xD;
very seldom saw him of an evening if he went&#xD;
out after supper, as it had been my custom, ever&#xD;
since my illness, to retire to my room early in&#xD;
the evening. This night, however, instead of&#xD;
passing on immediately to his own room, he,&#xD;
stopped at my door and rapped hesitatingly upon&#xD;

spite of all the harsh suspicions which had been&#xD;
awakened in my breast by the singularity of&#xD;
my husband's conduct, I yet instinctively felt&#xD;
that he would give me no cause to repent my&#xD;
confidence. True, Eddie had assured mue that&#xD;
when under the influence of passion or jealousy&#xD;
John was a totally different man from his ordi-&#xD;
nary self-- that all reason seemed to desert&#xD;
him, and that he could become a very fiend for&#xD;
wickedness. True, I had myself seen him, from&#xD;
the slightest causes, become so overpowered&#xD;
with anger, that I could hardly help believing&#xD;
that if he had really any cause for suspicion, lie&#xD;
&#xD;
it.                                        might allow his anger to carry him to almost&#xD;
" Are you asleep, Caroline ?" he asked, in a any length. Yet, in spite of all, I believed in&#xD;
strange, eager voice.                      him; believed in his honor, his affection, his&#xD;
"I have gone to bed," I answered, "but I good sense ; and I relied upon these qualities to&#xD;

for you."                                  cause for anger he had against his brother. I&#xD;
He was silent a moment, but then answered, relied upon them, I say, even while my reason&#xD;
I thought, in a disappointed tone-         assured me that I had every cause to believe&#xD;
"No ! never mind, I won't trouble you. I that my faith would ultimately be completely&#xD;
had hoped to have spoken to you to-night, but overthrown.&#xD;
perhaps it will be better to wait until morning.  So musing, I at length fell asleep, and it was&#xD;
Good-night!" and then, before I had made up bright day-light ere I again opened my eyes&#xD;
my mind whether or not to accede to what he upon life and its realities.&#xD;
so evidently wished, he had passed on, and en-  .1 heard Miss Jenny moving in her room&#xD;

done. His cheeks were flushed, his eyes spark-&#xD;
led, and his voice was as joyous and light-heart-&#xD;
ed as that of a boy. What had become of that&#xD;
jealous monster, on murderous thoughts intent,&#xD;
whom Eldie, but yesterday, had depicted to&#xD;
mse in such frightful colors? Unconsciously I&#xD;
heaved a great sigh of relief, and with that sigh&#xD;
a mountain of care, of whose existence I had&#xD;
hardly beei conscious, was lifted from my&#xD;
heart, and I laughed too, I knew not why, as I&#xD;
met his eyes.&#xD;
" Yes !" he said, answering my mute inquiry.&#xD;
" You are right.  I am changed indeed. The&#xD;
blind, jealous fool who rushed from your pres-&#xD;
ence yesterday will never  return to you.&#xD;
Rieliard's himself again,' and can defy all the&#xD;
ghosts of all the dead and buried passions that&#xD;
ever disfigured either your life or his own, to&#xD;
transform him again into the self-tormenting&#xD;
wretch lie so long has been."&#xD;
'But why- ?" I commenced, and again lie&#xD;
answered, before my lips had formed the ques-&#xD;
tion- -&#xD;
" Common sense has returned to me. One&#xD;
ray of truth has illumined the chaos of my in-&#xD;
aginings, and now all is light and peace."&#xD;
''You have grown poetical, I perceive, along&#xD;
with all other changes," I said, a little crossly,&#xD;
for I could not forget that however his mind&#xD;
might have been illumined, mine was still grop-&#xD;
ing in darkness ; a darkness that never could&#xD;
be illumined while the barrier his crime had&#xD;
&#xD;
reared between us mnaiitaiued its position.&#xD;
" I have not the time to seek an explanation&#xD;
of your mystical speeches now. help me lift&#xD;
out the table, please ; it is Itigh time break-&#xD;
fast was ready."&#xD;
He obeyed my mandates in a fashion, that&#xD;
is, he himself lifted the heavy table from its&#xD;
position against the wall, and placed it in the&#xD;
middle of the room, utterly disdaining the as-&#xD;
sistance I stood ready to afford.&#xD;
"(Get to your cooking if you are in such a&#xD;
hurry.  I will try my hand at setting the table.&#xD;
Spare mc those scornful glances, Mrs. Harring-&#xD;
ton; I am quite competent to the task, I assure&#xD;
you."&#xD;
What could it all mean? I asked myself,&#xD;
as, dreading my dignity should yield to the joy-&#xD;
ous face and cheery voice, I yielded him the&#xD;
occupation he sought, and busied myself with&#xD;
other preparations for the meal.  Presently he&#xD;
stood by my side again, and, as I hammered&#xD;
viciously at a beef-steak, he re-commenced the&#xD;
attack.&#xD;
" Any thing else I can do for you, my dear?"&#xD;
" No !" I curtly replied.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, then, perhaps you will let me tell&#xD;
you what I think you will consider good news.&#xD;
Frank Nettleby and I are friends again, and on&#xD;
Monday I resume my old position in the store."&#xD;
"I am glad of that," I said, looking up at&#xD;
him, with tears of joy starting to my eyes .&#xD;
"glad, of course, that Agnes's lover and you&#xD;
are friends, but still gladder to think that you&#xD;
have at last found suitable employment. I&#xD;
have felt so sorry for you, John, lately - I&#xD;
could not help it, in spite of-"&#xD;
" In spite of what ?" he questioned eagerly,&#xD;
as I stopped abruptly ; but I paid no attention&#xD;
to the question.&#xD;
"Tell me all about it, can you ?-why you&#xD;
quarreled, and how you have both succeeded in&#xD;
forgetting your grievances ?" For surely, I&#xD;
thought, if a knowledge of John's crime had&#xD;
been the cause of the quarrel, he never could&#xD;
have resumed his position in the store.&#xD;
He flushed deeply, and his eyes sank before&#xD;
mine, as he answered, at first somewhat con-&#xD;
fusedly, but afterward rapidly and distinctly-&#xD;
"I told you yesterday, Caro, you know, what&#xD;
an absurd impression I had for months been la-&#xD;
boring under. I know now how utterly founda-&#xD;
tionless my suspicions have been, and what a&#xD;
consummate fool I must have appeared both to&#xD;
you and Frank. If you knew all, perhaps you&#xD;
would not think me quite so mad as you now&#xD;
must; but I can not tell you my excuses now;&#xD;
indeed, they are no excuses, after all, and I shall&#xD;
never offer them as such. The most I can hope&#xD;
is, that they may serve to extenuate my folly a&#xD;
little; excuse it, nothing can. I should have&#xD;
believed in iyou, in spite of mischief-makers ;&#xD;
and had I done so-but I see you are impatient&#xD;
to hear of my interview with Frank, and ex-&#xD;
planations of all that preceded it will come in&#xD;
due time, for henceforth, Caroline, there shall&#xD;
be no misunderstandings between us ; whatever&#xD;
may be our troubles, I will have no more mys-&#xD;
teries."&#xD;
"That is my own determination," I said, as I&#xD;
met bravely the honest eyes that so fearlessly&#xD;
gazed iito mine.  "And I, too, will have a&#xD;
story to tell at no distant day, that will per-&#xD;
haps grieve and anger you not a little. But go&#xD;
on with your own account now.'"&#xD;
"When I left you yesterday, I went imme-&#xD;
diately to Edwin-but perhaps he has told you&#xD;
of what occurred between us? He promised&#xD;
me that he would when I left him, though I&#xD;
hardly believed at the time that lie intended to&#xD;
keep his word."&#xD;
"lie didn't," I remarked concisely ; for I&#xD;
need scarcely say that to not cite syllable of the&#xD;
&#xD;
graphic story with which Master Eddie had yes-&#xD;
terday regaled me, did I now give credence.&#xD;
And John resumed-&#xD;
"I feared as much. Then that, too, is re-&#xD;
served for me to tell, but the task must be de-&#xD;
ferred until a later date. It was dark when I&#xD;
went to seek Frank, for as I was desirous of se-&#xD;
curing a private interview with him, I waited&#xD;
until I knew that I should find him in his&#xD;
rooms, and then I sought him there. I was&#xD;
fortunate enough to find him alone, and in a&#xD;
very few words I explained to him how the web&#xD;
of misunderstandings which my blindness had&#xD;
woven around our friendship, had been severed&#xD;
by the discovery I had made of his feelings tg-&#xD;
ward Agnes. I told him of my past sufferings&#xD;
and my present remorse ; I humbled my pride&#xD;
before him as I never thought I could have&#xD;
done to a fellow-man, and entreated his pardon.&#xD;
I pleaded my cause bravely, Caroline, for I per-&#xD;
suaded myself that in winning his pardon, I&#xD;
was also winning yours. And like the noble-&#xD;
hear.ted, generous fellow he is, he granted me&#xD;
unconditionally the grace Lsought, complete ob-&#xD;
livion of the past, and a cordial renewal of&#xD;
more than our old friendship for the future. I&#xD;
communicated to him the purport of your let-&#xD;
ter, inviting him in my own name, as well as&#xD;
in yours, to call upon you at the time you ap-&#xD;
pointed, which he faithfully agreed to do."&#xD;
"You have told me nothing about the origin&#xD;
of your quarrel with him, John ; whether it&#xD;
was your fault or his, or when it transpired."&#xD;
He looked a little foolish.&#xD;
"I do not feel at all anxious to tell you,&#xD;
Caro, I assure you; but as I have promised to&#xD;
make a clean breast of it, I will conceal nothing&#xD;
As I told you yesterday, the cause of our es-&#xD;
trangement was the belief existing in my breast&#xD;
(how impressed there is too long a story now to&#xD;
tell), that you loved Frank, as you had never&#xD;
loved me. Do not insist upon my telling more.&#xD;
You can not guess the mortification which even&#xD;
the bare remembrance of my folly now occa-&#xD;
sions me. Your wifely purity I never for one&#xD;
moment doubted ; hardly in that moment of&#xD;
overwhelming ;passion when I discovered you,&#xD;
flying from your home, as jealousy whispered,&#xD;
to the arms of your lover. I believed even&#xD;
then, mad with passion though I was, that your&#xD;
mind was affected by the struggle you were un-&#xD;
dergoing between your love and your duty.&#xD;
The fever which had already seized upon you,&#xD;
proved that I had partially surmised the truth,&#xD;
and that for your actions that night you were&#xD;
really not responsible. But though I could&#xD;
feel no anger against you when your conduct&#xD;
&#xD;
was thus explained, my ire against Nettleby&#xD;
was all the more bitter. I sought hinuin the&#xD;
first days of your illness, when I was almost out&#xD;
of my senses with jealousy, rage, and the fear&#xD;
of losing you; and branding him with every&#xD;
epithet of shame and contempt that one man&#xD;
could apply to another, I revealed to him the&#xD;
base suspicions that were goading me to mad-&#xD;
ness, and, deaf to remonstrance or explanation,&#xD;
I declined all farther intercourse with him, of&#xD;
whatsoever nature, and forbade him to comtmuni-&#xD;
cate with any member of my family, under pai&#xD;
of I know not what indefinite threat of vets-&#xD;
geance. I do not suppose my threats would&#xD;
have had much effect, had my suspicions been&#xD;
true, or my accusations just ones; as it was,&#xD;
imagining I dare say the mortification my in-&#xD;
sane jealousy must be productive of to you, and&#xD;
willing to save you all possible annoyance, lh&#xD;
obeyed my behests as literally as if lie had real-&#xD;
ly feared the mad threats I had made. That is&#xD;
all I have to confess, Caroline ; and now tell&#xD;
me that you have forgiven entirely all my stu-&#xD;
pidity, for, indeed, it has been no worse, as you&#xD;
villa know when you have heard all that I can&#xD;
bring forward in extenuation ; yet, I have a&#xD;
longing to hear you say that you will forget and&#xD;
forgive all the wrongs my jealousy has inflict-&#xD;
ed upon you, from your own kind and generous&#xD;
heart, without waiting to hear my excuses, or to&#xD;
judge the extent of my misdemeanors."&#xD;
Ie looked at me so eagerly, yet so confident-&#xD;
ly, seeming so certain of receiving the answer that&#xD;
he desired, that my heart ached within me when&#xD;
I remembered that, while all his.cause of comim-&#xD;
plaint against me had been completely swept&#xD;
away, msine against him still remained in full&#xD;
force. I could not conquer the trembhig in&#xD;
my voice as I answered-&#xD;
Your sins of jealousy and suspicion, John,&#xD;
I find no difficulty both in forgetting and for-&#xD;
giving, for, until yesterday, I did not even know&#xD;
that they existed. You unwst know-it can not&#xD;
be possible that you have so long failed to know&#xD;
that my alienation has sprung from a far dif'er-&#xD;
ent, a far more serious cause."&#xD;
He looked at me wistfully, and yet a little&#xD;
perplexedly too, as lie said-&#xD;
"Like yourself, I can not understand how you&#xD;
have failed to know that it was jealousy of&#xD;
Frank Nettleby that has caused my lmnEst un-&#xD;
pardonable conduct toward you; and 11 ave as&#xD;
surely thought that it was love of him which&#xD;
had turned your heart from me. You say it is&#xD;
not that ; you tell mec that you have never even&#xD;
suspected my jealousy ; it Hleaveni's mnamne, what&#xD;
is it then that eani so have altered you?"'&#xD;

STRANGE DEVELOPMENTS.             IO&#xD;
&#xD;
I hung my head mutely; not yet had come&#xD;
the time for my confession, and I dared not say&#xD;
a word, lest I should again unconsciously break&#xD;
the promise I had given the day before.  John&#xD;
looked at me, as I stood before him, with eyes&#xD;
so eager, so questioning, that I felt as if they&#xD;
were reading my very soul.&#xD;
"I know you do not love another," he said,&#xD;
in a voice whose pathos stirred my spirit to its&#xD;
inmost depths.  "My wife, (do you not love&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
I turned my white face toward him; my eyes&#xD;
looked into his, and the truth sprang to my lips&#xD;
as so long it had been in my heart-&#xD;
"God knows I do ; I can not help it."&#xD;
His thee was lighted up as if by magic; every&#xD;
shadow of doubt and perplexity vanished as he&#xD;
looked at me, and in a voice quivering with ex-&#xD;
ultation he said-&#xD;
"'Then all is well. So long as we love each&#xD;
other, my Caroline, no difficulties, no estrange-&#xD;
ments can seriously impair our happiness. Tell&#xD;
inc what it is that I have done to anger you?&#xD;
Once brought to light, I know this hideous spec-&#xD;
tre will prove to be the merest nothing that ever&#xD;
an imaginative woman allowed to torture her."&#xD;
"Don't force me to become your accuser,&#xD;
John," I said, and the tears started to my eyes.&#xD;
"Your own conscience must surely supply you&#xD;
with an all-sufficient cause for my estrange-&#xD;
sient."&#xD;
lie looked puzzled for a moment, and then&#xD;
s with a start, as if the idea had but just occurred&#xD;
to him-&#xD;
" Surely !" lie said, " you have not been al-&#xD;
lowing that miserable affiir at Casey's to cause&#xD;
all this trouble between us?  It was all hushed&#xD;
up at the tine, you know, and I had hoped it&#xD;
was quite forgotten ; I would have told you all&#xD;
about it myself, long ago, had I not hoped to&#xD;
spare you useless pain by keeping the knowl-&#xD;
edge from you. Your pride must indeed have&#xD;
been of a fiercer nature than I had ever dream-&#xD;
ed it, if you are going to allow such a trifle as&#xD;
that to influence you so long and deeply."&#xD;
I was almost paralyzed at the audacity which&#xD;
could speak of so heinous a crime in so flippant&#xD;
a manner.   When I spoke again it was in a&#xD;
cold, hard voice, that showed no signs of soften-&#xD;
ing or relenting.&#xD;
"A triple or not, Mr. Iarrington-and I sup&#xD;
ppose by familiarity with crime we may learn to&#xD;
1ook upon any deed, however horrible, as a trifle&#xD;
I think voi will find it all-suflicient to hinder&#xD;
se from ever again being, in asughit save the&#xD;
iiame, your wife. My pride h as still enough vi&#xD;
tadity to preserve me0 from aiiy comnpanionshlip&#xD;
&#xD;
that I can avoid, with the man who has brought&#xD;
dishonor upon my father's name."&#xD;
"Nonsense !" he said, and he actually laugh-&#xD;
ed, a joyous, exultant laugh that almost pro-&#xD;
voked me to a flood of angry tears. "My dear-&#xD;
est girl, if that romantic notion of yours is all&#xD;
that is to intervene between me and happiness,&#xD;
I do not despair of proclaiming myself, ere the&#xD;
new year has come upon us, the happiest man&#xD;
in Boston. By this, I swear it !" And placing&#xD;
a hand on either side of my head, he lifted my&#xD;
face to his, and, stooping, kissed me.&#xD;
I was terribly indignant, but, fortunately for&#xD;
him, the entrance of Agnes to inquire concern-&#xD;
ing the mysterious non-appearance of breakfast,&#xD;
caused my wrath to pass off speechlessly, and in&#xD;
triumph and good nature my husband took his&#xD;
place opposite me at the table.&#xD;
No farther opportunity for a matrimonial tste-&#xD;
a-fate did I afford Mr. Hlarrington that day. I&#xD;
kept Agnes with me constantly while I went&#xD;
about my household duties, and ere they were&#xD;
all accomplished, Frank Nettleby made- his ap-&#xD;
pearance. I will not detail the reader by a&#xD;
prolonged account of the conversation which&#xD;
then ensued. It was a painfully embarrassing&#xD;
one to me in some respects, yet, relieved as I&#xD;
was of the one great fear that he (Frank) was&#xD;
cognizant of my husband's crime, all other&#xD;
grievances seemed but minor evils.&#xD;
Frank, himself, was only too glad to have the&#xD;
course of his love affairs thus suddenly and&#xD;
pleasantly made smooth before him, to quarrel&#xD;
at all as to the manner in which the affair was&#xD;
settled, and with his natural generosity of tem-&#xD;
per, tacitly consented to forget and forgive, en-&#xD;
tirely and immediately, all the disagreeable cir-&#xD;
cumnstances which had occurred in the last six&#xD;
months. Eager and enthusiastic as ever, Frank&#xD;
Nettleby at thirty was as self-satisfied and con-&#xD;
fiding a lover as he had been at five-and-twenty,&#xD;
and his extravagant devotion to Agnes was dis-&#xD;
turbed by no doubts as to the complete reciproc-&#xD;
ity of feeling on her part. Nor do I think&#xD;
he had any cause for doubt, for I fully believe&#xD;
that then, as now, my little sister loved her&#xD;
handsome adorer with all the strength and pas-&#xD;
sion of her nature, which, if not a very deep,&#xD;
- was as innocent and guileless a one as.ever was&#xD;
possessed by woman.&#xD;
Frank, in his old unceremonious fashion, stay-&#xD;
ed to dine with us, and John, seeing no proba-&#xD;
bility of quiet at home, and probably not yet&#xD;
able to feel himself quite comfortable in his&#xD;
friend's society, with a mnuttcred apology be-&#xD;
- took himself to the streets, and I, heaviing the&#xD;
lovers to their own devices, quietly sought my&#xD;
&#xD;
room, to muse in quiet over the odd and excit-&#xD;
ing events that had transpired within the past&#xD;
few days.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
STRANGE DEVELOPMENTS.&#xD;
SOMETIME during the course of the afternoon&#xD;
Mr. Nettleby departed, not however until he&#xD;
had extorted from his fanc the promise to ac-&#xD;
company him in the evening to some place of&#xD;
amusement which he imagined held forth par-&#xD;
ticular attractions. The coy lady had only con-&#xD;
sented upon the condition that either I or Miss&#xD;
Jenny could be persuaded to accompany her.&#xD;
I proved obdurate ; but Miss Jenny finally yield-&#xD;
ed to the joint persuasions of the lovers, so it&#xD;
chanced, after tea, when the three had departed,&#xD;
that John and I were left alone, to luxuriate&#xD;
as freely as we pleased in the pleasures of a&#xD;
confidential interview.&#xD;
Mr. Harrington had accompanied the trio to&#xD;
the door, and after fastening it upon them, he&#xD;
returned to the parlor to find me standing by&#xD;
the front window, gazing blankly into the gas-&#xD;
lighted streets, longing for yet dreading the&#xD;
coming explanations, which in my own mind I&#xD;
had quite resolved should settle at once and&#xD;
forever the future relations which were to be&#xD;
maintained between us.&#xD;
John's first act, upon entering, was to come to&#xD;
my side, and pass his arm around my waist.&#xD;
I pushed him away from me with all the strength&#xD;
I could muster.&#xD;
"Once for all, let me tell you, John Harring-&#xD;
ton, this must not, shall not be.. If you persist&#xD;
in forcing your affection upon me, spite of what&#xD;
I have told you concerning the nature of my&#xD;
feelings toward you, I will leave you immediately&#xD;
and forever. I will, though my heart should&#xD;
break in doing so."&#xD;
He looked at me, gravely indeed, but with by&#xD;
no means so submissive an air as I had intended&#xD;
him to exhibit.&#xD;
"Very well, my dear, I will do my best to&#xD;
refrain from such demonstrations of affection if&#xD;
they really displease you, but you must not ex-&#xD;
pect me to act the part of a despairing lover, for&#xD;
I tell you candidly I don't despair, by any means.&#xD;
Be seated now, and let me hear the explanation&#xD;
which you have been kind enough to promise&#xD;
inc."&#xD;
Now I had fully intended, in my mental antic-&#xD;
&#xD;
which his dark secret had been revealed to me,&#xD;
and finally winding up with an account of yes-&#xD;
terday's interview. But somehow, when once I&#xD;
started to speak of Edwin, my mind, still excited&#xD;
with the disclosures of the preceding (lay, re-&#xD;
verted continually to them, and before I knew it.&#xD;
I found myself pouring into my husband's atten-&#xD;
tive ear a complete description of the conversa-&#xD;
tion which had so distressed me ; incoherent in-&#xD;
deed, from tears and blushes, yet at all events&#xD;
sufficiently clear to render the whole affair toler-&#xD;
ably evident to my hearer.&#xD;
He listened to me throughout in silence, a&#xD;
contemptuous smile playing round his lips diu-&#xD;
ing the account of the imaginary interview be-&#xD;
tween his brother and himself; but gradually,&#xD;
as I proceeded, a dark frown settled upon his&#xD;
brow, while his compressed lips and hands in-&#xD;
voluntarily clenched, told how powerful was the&#xD;
restraint he was putting upon himself to repress&#xD;
a more noisy demonstration of his wrath, until,&#xD;
when I told him of the concluding words of my&#xD;
would-be lover, and the insulting kisses which&#xD;
he had dared to press upon my lips, then a sav-&#xD;
age oath, the first I had ever heard him give&#xD;
utterance to, burst from his lips, and springing&#xD;
from his chair, lie paced the room in violent&#xD;
agitation.&#xD;
It was some moments erc he could suflicient-&#xD;
ly control himself to speak to me again ; then&#xD;
he came and stood by my chair, and said in a&#xD;
voice more of sorrow than of anger-&#xD;
lie is my brother, Caroline ; what can I&#xD;
do ?'&#xD;
Relieved beyond measure to find, that the&#xD;
anger I had so much dreaded to arouse he was&#xD;
certainly able to hold in suitable control, I re-&#xD;
sponded hastily-&#xD;
"Do ! you can do nothing, of course. There&#xD;
is nothing to be done. I do not imagine that&#xD;
Eddie will make his appearance before either&#xD;
of us again at a very early date, and the wisest&#xD;
course for us to pursue, for our oivn sakes and&#xD;
for Jenny's, is to bury the whole affair in utter&#xD;
oblivion."&#xD;
" You are right," he said gravely, resuming&#xD;
his seat as he spoke. "Any disturbance made&#xD;
in the affair would bring more mortification&#xD;
upon you than upon him. It is only one snore&#xD;
count in the indictment against him. Ieaven&#xD;
help him when it comes to be settled !"&#xD;
"John," I said, a little timidly, after a mo-&#xD;
ment's pause, "how happens it that you can&#xD;
&#xD;
ipations of this moment, giving my husband a look upon this affair in so rational a light, when&#xD;
complete synopsis of my intercourse with his you were so unreasonably angry with poor&#xD;
brother, from the very beginning of our intimacy ; Frank for so much lighter a cause ?"&#xD;
telling, in the course of the tale, the manner in  "It is your love I am jealous of, Caroline.&#xD;

not theirs.   All the world may adore you if all o&#xD;
the world pleases, and so long as I am satisfied i&#xD;
you give no returning affection, it will disturb     e&#xD;
me   not a whit.     Frank Nettleby I was fool&#xD;
enough to believe you loved.      Edwin Harring-d&#xD;
tol-'    lie stopped short, but thee ontemptu-~&#xD;

the sentence.&#xD;
" Ah ! you don't know all yet," I began, in-r&#xD;
teilditlg then to tell of iny own  mistaken con-.&#xD;
duct toward my brother-in-law, but I was in-&#xD;
terrupted by a ring at the door-bell, which John&#xD;
left the room  to answer.    Ile returned shortly,I&#xD;
and tossed a letter into my lap.-      .&#xD;
" A very bulky missive for you, delivered by a1&#xD;
little ragged urchin, who sCanlltered off as soon&#xD;
as he sad thrust ite document into my hands."&#xD;
I tore opel the elivelope in some surprise,&#xD;
and glanced at tlse signature.&#xD;
Edwin Ilarrington-"&#xD;
I could not repress an ejacilation of dismay,&#xD;
which made John, who hsud picked up a news-&#xD;
ptper over which he was glancing, evidently&#xD;
determined to evitte no curiosity, look up at&#xD;
rt rather allXiotlsly antd sty-w&#xD;
Nothing wrong, Caro, I Hope ?"&#xD;
" No," I replied briefly, and then turning to&#xD;
the comn eteelne'nt of the letter, hogan eagerly&#xD;
its perusal.  I did not finish it until sometime&#xD;
later, for the  disclosure which     the first fewV&#xD;
pages revealed to me, rendered me for a time&#xD;
quile i-neasjlse of comprehen ing the rest.&#xD;
For the saske of unity, however, I will tran-&#xD;

of its audacious villainy,  It was dated the pie-&#xD;

snly loved you not, but positively regarded you with feel-&#xD;
ngs of veritable disdain. In those far-off days, when the&#xD;
frit was still within my grasp, ere my blundering broth-&#xD;
er had stretched forth his hands to pluck it, I considered&#xD;
Miss Caroline Manvers a commonplace, inanimate doli, as&#xD;
devoid of passion as of beauty; nor did I ever dream of&#xD;
my deplorable mistake-the one mistake, mark you, of&#xD;
my eventful career-until, upon my return from Europe,&#xD;
I beheld in the woman who sat at the head of my broth-&#xD;
er's table, and was called by my brother's name, the one&#xD;
woman whom I could love; the one soul throughout the&#xD;
universe of animate creation whose pulses I could have&#xD;
taught to beat responsive to my own. I recognized this'&#xD;
fact in all its appallmig intensity, and resolved from that&#xD;
self-same moment to combat the decree. I commenced&#xD;
with myself somewhat in this fashion: " The Lord who&#xD;
made John IIarrington and myself, has seen fit to endow&#xD;
him with home, friends, respectability, and the woman he&#xD;
loves; to ise lie has denied these gifts, but in their place&#xD;
He has given brains, and with them the steadfast deter-&#xD;
mination and undoubted ability to win for myself the&#xD;
woman whom I love. Thie odds are on my side, John&#xD;
IIarrington, and I think I shall wim  the game."   -&#xD;
From that moment I set myself to work to steal from&#xD;
Isis arms the treasure I coveted, the woman whose posses-&#xD;
sion would have mado of me any tliung she willed; whose&#xD;
loss will make of me-that which I love you too well to&#xD;
mention.&#xD;
I have failed ; I have risked all and lost all; I ant not&#xD;
one to struggle against fate ; still less am I one whso&#xD;
soud rather destroy the jewel ie can not grasp 'than see&#xD;
it sm the possession of another. Your love will never be&#xD;
given to me; then what care I to whom it is given? As&#xD;
well to John Iarrington as to any other man ; nay, I will&#xD;
say still more; I iad rather it were given to him than to&#xD;
any other man ; I owe him several good-natured turns,&#xD;
and I imis not ungrateful; I will give sins back ius wife ;&#xD;
would that he could appreciate her as she deserves ! Biut&#xD;
that, beloved Caroline, no man save myself could do; and&#xD;
me you have rejected.&#xD;
That my love is far above all petty malice, let the fol-&#xD;
lowing confession prove. To secure yosus happiness I draw&#xD;
down unhesitatingly the blackest opprobriums upon my de-&#xD;
voted head, and all that I ask at your hands itn return, is&#xD;
an occasional sigh to the memory of one who, despite his&#xD;
errors, loved you as only lie could love.&#xD;
You were a very devoted couple in those days of my&#xD;
first dawning love ; I will give you both credit for that.&#xD;
I was obliged to watch long and sharply ere I detected a&#xD;
lasw in your matrimonial armor. At last the fortunate&#xD;
slay arrived. I guessed at it darkly during that memora-&#xD;
ble dinner in whict lthe character of Mr. Casey's clerk&#xD;
was so freely dilated upon. I might perhaps have drop-&#xD;
ped the clse thus found from want of farther immediate&#xD;
unravehnent, had not my worthy brother himself direct-&#xD;
ed me to the light. The emotion whiclt John displayed&#xD;
at that time was evident enough to yotr unsophisticated&#xD;
eyes, and of csrs e did not escape mine. I had thought&#xD;
myself pretty well posted in his private affairs, and, I con-&#xD;
fess, such needless excitement puzzled me not a little. I&#xD;
seized the first opportunity to ask him the cause.&#xD;
"What affected you so strangely during Frank Nettle-&#xD;
by's revelations ?  You only told the simple truth, and&#xD;
Frank knew as well as yourself that it was purely impos-&#xD;
sible that you should be the person alluded to by S."&#xD;
And in guileless simplicity he responded-&#xD;
" It was not Frank Nettleby's suspicions that I shrank&#xD;
from exciting, but those of my wife. Site knows nothing&#xD;
ashout the Casey affair, and I pray God site never may.&#xD;
She is extremely highs-spirited and over-sensitive regard-&#xD;
ing any stain upon our family honor. My agitatio was&#xD;
caused by the dread that the knowledge of that shameful&#xD;
.a.ir shod    noome upon lien unpreparedi, ans at such a&#xD;
time and place."&#xD;
"n Ohs," eaid I careliess-ly, ''I thought perhaps it seas be-&#xD;
canoe yen wore a little sensitive conscerning the influence&#xD;
Nettleby seems to exercise over lien."&#xD;
&#xD;
VELOPMENTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
111&#xD;
&#xD;
s&#xD;
&#xD;
STRANGE DE&#xD;
"Nonsense!" was the impatient rejoinder. "Nettleby&#xD;
and she are old acquaintances; it is natural that site&#xD;
should pay him more than ordinary attention."&#xD;
"Oh, of course, John. You know I would not dream of&#xD;
suggesting that your wife cares more than shs ought for&#xD;
Frank, bet you know, I suppose, as well as I do, that he&#xD;
is madly in love with her. It was on her account, you&#xD;
remember, that he left America when you were married.&#xD;
Poor fellow I he is not wise to seek her society so constant-&#xD;
ly now."&#xD;
That was enough; I had now possessed myself of mate-&#xD;
rial sufficient to have sown dissension between the fondest&#xD;
couple that ever breathed. Jealousy on the part of the&#xD;
husband, pride on the part of the wife-invaluable treap-&#xD;
ons were these in the hands of so skillful a fencer as my-&#xD;
self, and I wasted no time in setting to work.&#xD;
You will doubtless remember the conversation I held&#xD;
with you shortly after, in which you disclosed to ue wtshst&#xD;
you imagined to be your sentiments concerning love and&#xD;
honor.~ That I was fdol enough to take it for granted&#xD;
that you spoke the truth, I sorrowfully admit.  Ican&#xD;
only account for this unusual blindness on may part by&#xD;
the plea that I was in love, and in my infatuation seized&#xD;
eagerly upon an assertion that it was so much my in-&#xD;
terest to consider true. I ought to have known that a&#xD;
' woman of your strength of character possesses affections&#xD;
as powerful and enduring as her nature ; that with such&#xD;
a one, to love once is to love forever, in utter disregard&#xD;
of the worthiness or the unworthiness of the msan upon&#xD;
whom she bestows herself. Alt these truths are patent&#xD;
to me now, but then I was scarcely more clear-sighted&#xD;
titan yourself, and I suffered myself to be ensnared as&#xD;
easily as the veriest shool-boy might have done. But to&#xD;
return to my recital.&#xD;
I rather disturbed your peace of mind in that interview,&#xD;
did I not ? I flatter myself thdse seeds of suspicion were&#xD;
very judiciously sown ; at all events, as you yourself can&#xD;
testify, they were of rapid growth, and bore plentiful fruit.&#xD;
There is no need for me to dwell upon the events of the&#xD;
next few months. I was not such a tyro in the art of de-&#xD;
eeption as to pour the calumny I meditated into unpre-&#xD;
-pared ears; still less was it likely I, should shake your&#xD;
confidence in my own guileless simplicity by open attacks&#xD;
upon the character of the man whom I as well as yourself&#xD;
was bound to love and reverence. I was prepared to&#xD;
worship him se enthusiastically as did his charming wife,&#xD;
could that worship in the end have helped me to win her&#xD;
affections from him.&#xD;
I made no char es, no definite assertions of any thing&#xD;
concerning him; yet, if yous will do me the justice to re-&#xD;
call those days, you will remember that not one of them&#xD;
passed over our heads wherein my little scheme was not&#xD;
dexterously forwarded. Now it was a covert insinuation;&#xD;
now a broken sentence; now a sigh or a tear appropriate-&#xD;
ly introdtuced, and applied by you as I intended it should&#xD;
se. The half-spoken charge which I had brought against&#xD;
himt upon that memorable day of our argument, I never&#xD;
for one moment suffered you to forget. Doubt rankled its&#xD;
your heart, and the wound spread and festered until you&#xD;
became so sore upon the subject of John's honor and truth,&#xD;
that you grew to imagine the most casual sentences re-&#xD;
ferred in some indirect manner to the subject which so&#xD;
-ineessantly haunted you.&#xD;
So matters progressed, and at last I came to the conclu-&#xD;
sion that yen were "ripe-for rebellion," and then I let fly&#xD;
my thunder-bolt.&#xD;
You of course have not forgotten the coin and its tell-&#xD;
tale envelope? The shock yos then received affected my&#xD;
sympathetic heart seaircely Icess titan it did your' owvn. Had&#xD;
it only been possible to have west your love without tor-&#xD;
tursing you in te process, believe me, dearest Caroline, I&#xD;
should tsyself have bsrne tenfold Cte agony I was obliged&#xD;

Was not that a tmaster-.troke of genius? / think it&#xD;
was, and I consider myself quite a competent jtdge itt&#xD;

Witll more than tie blindness of Titania of yore, yos&#xD;
fondly imagine that the realization of your ireamt ish&#xD;

in words that great souls had written for souls like om s to&#xD;

of respect and tifection, suite unconscious of the exi ti-ei&#xD;
of suc i monstrous possibilities as faithless u ive., jeslous-&#xD;
husbands, and adorng lovers. There were times during&#xD;
those few brief tmonsths that I wasactually happy; whises&#xD;
I almost pso'uadei myself that virtue ws not a  ham;&#xD;
s that happiness might inideedI se found in tme hloso m of&#xD;

tried to inmaginte a fumtur of domestic love and peace w'illh&#xD;
that pretty little puppet for my fireside angel. I-teally&#xD;
had serious notions at one time of following tite hepath yost&#xD;
so benevolently had marked oit for mte, ansd of maslking&#xD;
for myself another claim upon your affection by marrying&#xD;
your sister. But tdo not be indignant atthis seeming in-&#xD;
