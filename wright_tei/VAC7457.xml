Charles River and its belongings. A venere&#xD;
Its good  old host and 'hostess.   A  yout&#xD;
A colloquy, of which our hero is the subject&#xD;
protege.&#xD;
HE little riverCharles, although but a few&#xD;
miles in length, and not navigable two&#xD;
leagues for craft of any tonnage; possesses, never-&#xD;
theless, an importance that gives it fame and name&#xD;
over every other river in New England. Upon&#xD;
its banks was fought the battle of Breed's Hill,&#xD;
which eminence now swells green and stately&#xD;
from its waters, crowned with the granite shaft&#xD;
that will stand an eternal altar to heaven of the&#xD;
gratitude of a nation of freemen. Upon its&#xD;
classic shores stand the time-worn edifices of,&#xD;
Harvard University, whose students for two&#xD;
centuries have walked by its limpid waves in&#xD;
the shade of its venerable groves. At its mouth&#xD;
are two noble cities, one of which is memorable&#xD;
for the conflagration in which it was wrapped&#xD;
while the thunders of Bunker Hill were shaking&#xD;
its streets ; and the other is the metropolis of&#xD;
New England, the home of arts and of letters,&#xD;
the city of merchant princes, of poets and his-&#xD;
torians-Boston!1&#xD;
In selecting, therefore,}the shores of Charles&#xD;
river upon which to l y ie opening scenes of&#xD;
&#xD;
able ruin.   The inn and its frequenters.--&#xD;
hful aspirant for learning - and     honorS.--&#xD;
t. An interesting reminiscence of our youthful&#xD;
our story, we are making choice of no mean&#xD;
locality. If the reader will take the trouble to&#xD;
glance at the map, he will see that in ascending&#xD;
this river, after leaving Boston, with its thou-&#xD;
sand masts and hundred towers, on the left, and&#xD;
Charlestown and Bunker Hill on the right, with&#xD;
not a mile's breadth between, the river bends to&#xD;
the south and west, and begins to penetrate the&#xD;
champaign country that lies about Boston, at&#xD;
Lechmere's Point, on the main. Before *e&#xD;
ascend, however, so far, which is less than a&#xD;
league from its mouth, we have to pass beneath&#xD;
several noble bridges which span it, unitinghe&#xD;
peninsula of Boston with the main land. Leav-&#xD;
ing Lechmere's Point on the right, the voyager&#xD;
will find himself sailing through a level matsb,&#xD;
across which the river, lessened abruptly to a&#xD;
narrow stream, sluggishly winds in many a ser-&#xD;
pentine course. After passing Cambridge it&#xD;
stretches off southwardly and flows amid green&#xD;
fields, winding about the bases of pleasant hfs,&#xD;
meandering amid groves and reflecting updO its&#xD;
placid breast many a villa, farm-house an'd' ot-&#xD;

" And you will come earlier than you do Sat-&#xD;
urdays," said Dame Madge, in a voice more&#xD;
like a man's than that of David, but not the&#xD;
less kindly in its tone for all that ; nay, indeed,&#xD;
kindness and a sort of prideful love of the young&#xD;
man, seemed to give softness to the pitch of&#xD;
both their voices, and light up both their faces&#xD;
with affectionate interest.&#xD;
" I will leave the college early, mother, at&#xD;
least by two o'clock," he answered, as he kissed&#xD;
her on the cheek, and then shook Davy heartily&#xD;
by the hand, as if he loved them both with&#xD;
affectionate gratitude and respect. He then&#xD;

waters for which David Blacklock, the inn-&#xD;
keeper, had far and wide fame. The front of&#xD;
the hostel was, therefore, often thronged by&#xD;
carts and wagons to a late hour, and the rear of&#xD;
&#xD;
the hostel had sometimes as many as five or six&#xD;
barges and hay boats tied to its quay, some&#xD;
laden, on their way down the Charles, others&#xD;
empty, on their return.&#xD;
One evening, about an hour before sunset, a&#xD;
young man came out of the ,door of the hostel,&#xD;
habited in a plain blue frock coat, a low Harvard&#xD;
cap, and a bundle in one hand and a stout stick&#xD;
in the other. It was Sunday, and there was but&#xD;
one wagon by the door, and that of a traveller,&#xD;
who was just resuming his journey southward.&#xD;
In the rear there were but two empty wood-&#xD;
barges fastened, the men who owned them hay&#xD;
ing gone to their homes, Everything, therefore,&#xD;
wore the air of a quiet New England Sabbath.&#xD;
David Blacklpck accompanied the young man&#xD;
to the door, grasping his hand, as if bidding&#xD;
him " godspeed ;"  and  Dame Blacklock, a&#xD;
tall, strong woman, in a monstrous frilled cap&#xD;
and black silk apron,. also came out to see him&#xD;
depart.&#xD;
"Now, you must mind and come home,&#xD;
Ned, on your birthday, next Thursday," said&#xD;
David, who was a short, fat, blue and red faced&#xD;
man, with half whiskers and double chin, and&#xD;
the very face to make a customer at his ease.&#xD;
"Yes, father, I'll be sure not to forget it,"&#xD;
answered the young man, in a frank, cheery&#xD;
tone.&#xD;

and was marching off, when the Dame strode&#xD;
after him, and taking hold of his shoulder,&#xD;
said:&#xD;
" I mean to give you a little dance, boy, on&#xD;
your birthday, and the lads and lasses for three&#xD;
miles about '11 be invited."&#xD;
2 " You are so kind, mother."&#xD;
"Not a bit of it. ..So if you choose you can&#xD;
bring with you one or two of your collhgers."&#xD;
" Thanks, mother ; but I think I shall come&#xD;
alone."&#xD;
" Here. Good even, and     take care , of&#xD;
yourself."&#xD;
With the word "here " she had thrust, -a&#xD;
golden guinea into his hand, and he again- er&#xD;
sumed his tramp down the road. As she came&#xD;
back to the stoop of the inn, she turned and&#xD;
looked after him.&#xD;
" Isn't he a proper youth, man ?" she said,&#xD;
sententiously. "See how he treads like a&#xD;
soldier."&#xD;
" And carries his head like a king."&#xD;
"And how well made he is."&#xD;
" He is nearly six feet."&#xD;
"And only twenty."&#xD;
"Perhaps not more than nineteen, you know&#xD;
we don't know exactly," observed David, with&#xD;
a significant glance at his wife.&#xD;
"Yes, but I think he must be twenty."&#xD;
" And so brave he is, too. He carries cour-&#xD;
age in his eyes, as lions do."&#xD;
" Yes, and yet he is as gentle as a lamb.,&#xD;
With all his manliness he loves me now as much&#xD;
as he did when he was five years old."&#xD;
" The time we first saw him ! Ab, wife,&#xD;
what shall we make of him ? A lawyer, I've&#xD;
been thinking."&#xD;
" I would say no. Lawyers live on the mis-&#xD;
fortunes and crimes of men."&#xD;
" A doctor ?  What say you to that ?" sug-&#xD;
gested David, pleasantly.&#xD;
" Doctors live on the groans and, sufferings&#xD;
of their race. No doctor !" she answered, very&#xD;
positively.&#xD;
" What say you to--.to a minister ?"&#xD;
" Ministers are called of God. If he be,&#xD;
then let him be a minister; but he must not&#xD;
thrust himself into that holy place."'&#xD;

"True. What, then, my sweet Madge, shall&#xD;
we make of him?   An inn-keeper?"&#xD;
" Wouldst thou make an inn-keeper of one&#xD;
who has talents, education and ambition enough&#xD;
to be a president or a Washington senator.&#xD;
We have given him every advantage that the&#xD;
richest men's sons possess ; and having educated&#xD;
him as a gentleman we must make a gentleman&#xD;
of him.  Has he ever kept thy bar? or curried&#xD;
thy stable horses? or waited on our customers ?&#xD;
Have we taught him to do this'?"&#xD;
" No; he has done it only of his own pleas-&#xD;
ure when he would ; and he would aid me in all&#xD;
things if I would suffer it."&#xD;
" Yes, he has no pride, but willing and&#xD;
cheerful, and seeks to do all he can to lighten&#xD;
our labor."&#xD;
"Never was a nobler youth."&#xD;
"Never one more loved by a mother than he&#xD;
is loved by tue. Therefore, I would see him&#xD;
take the position for which nature and the edu-&#xD;
cation we have given him have" fitted him. In&#xD;
a few months he will complete the university&#xD;
course."&#xD;
"If I was rich I would give him money and&#xD;
let him set up for a gentleman," said Davy, in&#xD;
the warm benevolence of his heart, while his&#xD;
pleasant looking gray eyes sparkled. " I would&#xD;
like to see him owner of-of-let me see-I&#xD;
would like to see him the owner of Grasmere&#xD;
Grove, and married to--to--to-the handsomest&#xD;
maiden in the land. There is Isabel Lawrence&#xD;
who-".&#xD;
" David Blacklock, you don't know what you&#xD;
are talking about. Miss Lawrence is too rich&#xD;
and aristocratic to think of Edward, noble and&#xD;
good as he is."&#xD;
"He is handsome enough for any of them,&#xD;
be they who they be." .&#xD;
"Young girls don't marry young men for&#xD;
beauty, man. No, no!I  Worthy as he is, he&#xD;
can't look so high. He is known only as Ed&#xD;
ward Blacklock, the taverner's son, as he is to&#xD;
all intents and purposes, and no more ; and talk&#xD;
about his looking to the proud and beautifu&#xD;
Miss Lawrence shows that, though you have kep&#xD;
a public house all your life, you have seen very&#xD;
little of the world."&#xD;
&#xD;
"But I was on'y supposing I was rich&#xD;
and could made him so," answered David,&#xD;
apologetically.&#xD;
" But you are not rich. . It has cost us all&#xD;
our earnings to educate Edward."&#xD;
" I don't begrudge a dollar of it," responded&#xD;
the stout taverner, resolutely.&#xD;
"Nor do I. One of these days Edward may&#xD;
take a rank with Miss Lawrence or the best in&#xD;
the land. But he has got first to make his own .&#xD;
fortune, his own name and his own position.&#xD;
He must rise gradually till by his talents and&#xD;
industry he commands those privileges which&#xD;
his present station has denied him in the out.&#xD;
start."&#xD;
David looked at his wife and bowed uncon-&#xD;
sciously, as he always did when she spoke in&#xD;
this sensible way ; for Dame Madge, as David&#xD;
said to everybody in praising her, " had a world&#xD;
of sense, and could talk like a Cambridge pro-&#xD;
fessor, to say nothing about books." He now&#xD;
regarded her with mingled admiration and&#xD;
respect.&#xD;
" By St. George's dragon, you say right,&#xD;
wife ; you always come out right about every-&#xD;
thing we ever talked about yet. It is time, as&#xD;
you say, he must make his way. He must get&#xD;
so high up that he can't see the old inn nor so-&#xD;
ciety either. But I'm afraid he'll lose sight of&#xD;
the poor old inn-keeper too."&#xD;
"Not Edward ! If he should get to be&#xD;
President of the United States he would set us&#xD;
down at his table, one on the right hand side&#xD;
and the other at the left, and do us honor before&#xD;
the great and mighty men of the land."&#xD;
" That he would.   That he would, wife,"&#xD;
said Davy, rubbing his hands in anticipation of&#xD;
this prospective honor. " But we haven't de-&#xD;
cided," said Davy, filling his pipe, and seating&#xD;
r himself on a bench before his house, where the&#xD;
evening sun could warm him, for it was one of&#xD;
- those bright autumnal days when the sun's rays&#xD;
feel peculiarly genial to old men, " we haven't&#xD;
yet decided what he is to be."&#xD;
 " I am for having him a place in the navy,"&#xD;
t answered the dame, firmly.&#xD;
" Then he would be shot or drowned right&#xD;
&#xD;
off" answered Davy, as he pushed a chair with&#xD;
his foot, as a hint to his good dame to sit down&#xD;
opposite to him, a hint which, after getting her&#xD;
big Bible, she took.&#xD;
"Young men must run risks," answered the&#xD;
dame, as she adjusted her iron spectacles pre-&#xD;
paratory to reading her usual Sunday evening&#xD;
chapter."I would like to have him enter the&#xD;
navy. He has a decided taste for the sea. He&#xD;
has managed a boat from a boy ; and since that&#xD;
trip you took him on with you to Halifax, when&#xD;
you went after the legacy that English distant&#xD;
relative of yours left you, he has said he would&#xD;
of all things prefer the sea."&#xD;
" Ay, that he would, that he would. At&#xD;
sea he was always aloft, or steering, or doing&#xD;
duty ; so that by the time we got back to Boston&#xD;
the skipper said he was half a sailor already.&#xD;
But I don't like them storms at sea," added&#xD;
David, shaking his head.  "I don't believe the&#xD;
sea was ever made to go upon, not I; and that&#xD;
Providence sets its waves sometimes tumblin'&#xD;
mountain high to keep people ashore."&#xD;
"I have already spoken with the Commodore&#xD;
who stopped here last year when he was looking&#xD;
at Colonel R---'s place, intending to buy it.&#xD;
He has promised me he will use his influence to&#xD;
get him in as a midshipman."&#xD;
"I'm afraid he's too old for that."&#xD;
" It may be so. I am going to see him again&#xD;
about the matter, and I have no doubt--"&#xD;
"Here comes young Manfred Lawrence, with&#xD;
his gun and dogs," said David, interrupting her,&#xD;
as he saw a young man in a hunter's dress, and&#xD;
with a gun on his arm, followed by a setter dog&#xD;
and a pointer come along the road from up the&#xD;
river path.&#xD;
"Yes, rich and, Sabbath breaking ; his gold&#xD;
gives him boldness to break God's laws as well&#xD;
as man's."&#xD;
" Nay, wife, you are too harsh. The young&#xD;
man is in college all the week, and he must&#xD;
have some recreation, to be sure," said the be-&#xD;
nevolent David.&#xD;
"So is Edward in college all the week.&#xD;
Think you he would shoot or fish on Sunday for&#xD;
all that ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" No, that he wouldn't. But it depends;on&#xD;
a man's conscience, I suppose ; and richfolks&#xD;
don't seem to have as particular consciences as&#xD;
poor people. Good even, sir," added Davy,&#xD;
removing his pipe and making a civil bow with&#xD;
it, not having any hat to remove from his head.&#xD;
"You seem to have been sporting to-day ?"&#xD;
"Yes, but poor luck," answered the young&#xD;
hunter, stopping before the stoop of the inn,&#xD;
and resting the butt of his double-barrelled&#xD;
Manton upon the broad and well foot-worn stone&#xD;
step. He then glanced at Dame Blacklock,&#xD;
who, without deigning to notice him, had set&#xD;
herself to reading her Bible on his approach.&#xD;
He evidently did not like her contemptuous in-&#xD;
difference, for with a sneer he said-" What&#xD;
news from the old world, old lady ? I see you&#xD;
are reading in Moses and the Prophets. There&#xD;
was plenty of game destroyed in that flood father&#xD;
Noah brought on the earth ; but it seems he&#xD;
took care to keep a few birds and a deer or two&#xD;
for his own eating."&#xD;
"This is the news I find here, and doubtless&#xD;
it is news to you, young gentleman," answered&#xD;
the bold dame; and she read in a loud tone these&#xD;
words: " Thou shalt keep holy the Sabbath."&#xD;
He started. They seemed like a command&#xD;
from the voice of God, she read them with such&#xD;
impressive majesty.&#xD;
" Bless me, what a preacher she would&#xD;
make !" ejaculated David, in an under tone,&#xD;
partly in pridefulness, partly in awe. . She re-&#xD;
sumed her reading without deigning the young&#xD;
man any further notice. He looked pale and&#xD;
angry, and taking up his gun, went on&#xD;
muttering :&#xD;
" When I get to the property I will have you&#xD;
ousted out of this, old witch !"&#xD;
" And he will do it too, Margy,"' said Davy,&#xD;
looking troubled. "-I am sorry -you gave him&#xD;
such a hard hit from scripture."&#xD;
" I am not. If, when he comes to the prop-&#xD;
erty, he turns us out by refusing to renew the&#xD;
lease, God will not suffer you or I to come to&#xD;
want for reading his commandments to a Sabbath-&#xD;
breaker."&#xD;
" You are always right, always do .right, say&#xD;

right, and know all that's right. I wish I had&#xD;
half your brains. See him go stalking off!&#xD;
How differently he looks from our Edward."&#xD;
"As different as Satan and saint," answered&#xD;
the strong-spoken woman.&#xD;
"Yet he is good looking, fair in form, tall&#xD;
and well put together."&#xD;
" So is a blood horse. An animal is an ani-&#xD;
mal, whether he go on two legs or four."&#xD;
" By St. George's dragon, dame, but you&#xD;
are right in that. A fine horse is no sign of a&#xD;
good soul and honest character."&#xD;
"It is the.spirit and heart that make a man,&#xD;
not the shape, or symmetry, or height of his&#xD;
body. Did you see the eyes of this Manfred&#xD;
Lawrence ?"&#xD;
"Sharp enough."&#xD;
"Sharp ! There is a very devil lurking in&#xD;
each-a wicked, bad hearted devil ! Handsome&#xD;
as his face is, it is lighted up by a dangerous&#xD;
spirit. I would not trust that man to have the&#xD;
power to kill me ; for beshrew me but he would&#xD;
do it this night for that scripture I read him, if&#xD;
he were sure that he would never be discovered.&#xD;
No, no, he neither fears God nor man. And&#xD;
yet he is as haughty as a prince.  I do not for-&#xD;
get the time when he rode up last year, and&#xD;
seeing Edward standing on.the porch, threw his&#xD;
rein to him and ordered him to hold his horse&#xD;
while he came in to drink."&#xD;
" Yes, and Eddy did it."&#xD;
"And.did you see how he did it ?  Did you&#xD;
see the smile of calm superiority with which he&#xD;
did it?  He knew that the rich Manfred Law-&#xD;
rence meant to insult him, and he would not be&#xD;
insulted ; for he did exactly as he ordered him,&#xD;
as if he had done it for a friend, and had not&#xD;
noticed the manner ; and in this way the insult&#xD;
lost its force ; and -I saw how mean Manfred&#xD;
looked, and how he blushed with a sense of in-&#xD;
feriority, as Edward surrendered the bridle to&#xD;
him with a quiet smile, and pleasantly wished&#xD;
him an agreeable ride."&#xD;
" It takes Ned. I should have knocked him&#xD;
over if I had been in Ned's place. But he's&#xD;
got a deal of your wit, Margy. I wonder if&#xD;
they ever speak in college."&#xD;
&#xD;
"No.   Manfred never recognizes him, though&#xD;
he knows him well; nay, as boys they have&#xD;
boated, fished, and roamed the woods together ;&#xD;
but when they grew older, and one realized that&#xD;
he was an heir, and that his companion was but&#xD;
the son of an inn-keeper, they ceased to asso-&#xD;
ciate ; and I am not sorry, for. Edward loses&#xD;
nothing, but rather gains by the termination of&#xD;
their intimacy."&#xD;
" So I think, to be sure, Margy ; you are al-&#xD;
ways right. Dear bless us, how like a book&#xD;
you talk."&#xD;
"The sister Isabel is superior to her brother,&#xD;
if one may judge by looks. But she has been&#xD;
so long away till last month at school, he has&#xD;
not seen her to have much evil influence over&#xD;
her ; and doubtless she is now old enough-for&#xD;
she must be eighteen or nineteen-to have her&#xD;
character pretty well formed."  -&#xD;
" She's amazing handsome, that is certain.&#xD;
I could light my pipe at her eyes, they are so&#xD;
bright. Then she has a toss of her head that&#xD;
is just like that of a deer when it goes trotting&#xD;
along on a ridge of a clear morning, snuffing up&#xD;
the bracing air, and feeling his high blood. and&#xD;
scarcely feeling the ground as he passes over&#xD;
it !"&#xD;
"Why, Davy, you are cracked, man ," ex-&#xD;
claimed his wife, looking over the top of her&#xD;
spectacles at her husband, from whom she had-&#xD;
never before heard a speech to equal that.&#xD;
" Not a bit of it, Margy.  If I use college&#xD;
talk sometimes, I catch it from you and Ned ;&#xD;
and if I ever use it, by St. George's dragon I&#xD;
ought to use it in speaking of pretty Bella&#xD;
Lawrence. She speaks like an angel, any how.&#xD;
Never heard such a musical voice.  Says she to-&#xD;
me, as her mother stopped her carriage to ask&#xD;
me about the pair of horses she wanted me to&#xD;
buy for her, you know, says she, ' Ah, Mister&#xD;
David, Icam glad to see you looking so well.&#xD;
You don't recollect me,.I suppose, it is so many&#xD;
years since I used to be at home, a little girl;&#xD;
but you look the same, only a little more corpu.&#xD;

ly upon his aldermanic abdomen, and added,&#xD;
" Perhaps I do grow a beetle fleshy, wife !"&#xD;

turned to the New Testament and opened, with  " I did not think of it."&#xD;
a hand evidently familiar with the places in the  "Nor I, or I would have kept it by an apple.&#xD;

cross hands in friendship and brotherly love ?"  "He knows it as a dream  only. He says&#xD;
"Hark ! There was a gun. He is shooting that he is not sure that what he has supposed&#xD;

&#xD;
he woke up. Wasn't it a heavy sleep be was&#xD;
in?  Full twelve hours before we could wake&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"Because he was drugged.   0, there was a&#xD;
crime.in some one.  May they have been spar-.&#xD;
ed to repent the deed," said Dame Blacklock,&#xD;
rising to go in ; for- by this time the sun was&#xD;
down, and the shades of twilight were deepening,&#xD;
into the darkness of a -starry night.&#xD;
David remained yet a little longer, smoking&#xD;
his pipe,'and' thinking over the time when, as&#xD;
he was standing fishing from a rock in the rear of&#xD;
the inn, he saw a seaman's blue chest, with the&#xD;
lid down, floating past with the current, and&#xD;
pressing down two-thirds deep in the water, as&#xD;
if it carried weight. His pole was a very long&#xD;
one, and by throwing it skilfi lly out with the&#xD;
additional length of the line, he succeeded in&#xD;
striking the chest with the hook, and drawing it&#xD;
in to the shore. Upon raising the lip, he dis-&#xD;
covered a boy of five years old, or thereabouts,&#xD;
lying fast asleep in the bottom. He uttered so&#xD;
loud an exclamation that his good wife ran out&#xD;
and saw the child also.. It had dark brown hair&#xD;
cropped short, as if shears had been rudely used&#xD;
to s'evr-,clusters of rich ringlets from the head.&#xD;
His' complexion was fair and soft, his hands&#xD;
white, his feet, which were bare, tender, as if&#xD;
they had never been used to tread the ground&#xD;
shoeless, and his clothing very coarse, but near-&#xD;
ly new, yet of the cheapest and meanest des-&#xD;
cription. There was no paper, no sign in the&#xD;
chest or about him to indicate his name or&#xD;
whence he came. They at once removed him&#xD;
from the chest to a bed in the inn, and used&#xD;
&#xD;
every means to awake him out of 'the deathlike&#xD;
repose in which he, lay, and which, from the&#xD;
smell of opium on- his breath, which Dame&#xD;
Blacklock detected, had:been induced by an&#xD;
administered potion by some hand and for some&#xD;
object unknown.&#xD;
At length after twelve hours the boy awoke,&#xD;
and looked around with terror ; but seeing&#xD;
strange but kind faces regarding him,. and feel-&#xD;
ing the soft touch and gentle kiss of Dame&#xD;
Blacklock, he was re assured.&#xD;
"0, you will'save me-you will not let them&#xD;
hurt me !-will . you 2'' he said, in the most&#xD;
touching accents.&#xD;
"That we will not, by St. George's dragon !"&#xD;
answered David, whose belligerency was raised&#xD;
to a dangerous height by the indignation of his&#xD;
benevolence that any one should seek to injure&#xD;
so innocent a child. -"If they come here they&#xD;
will go away wi' hi broken heads.".&#xD;
"You are safe here, my child," answered&#xD;
the dame, folding him to her heart. "If you&#xD;
have no other parents, we will be to you father&#xD;
and mother."&#xD;
And faithfully had the inn-keeper and his&#xD;
wife fulfilled their pledge up to this day. No&#xD;
one ever came to inquire after the boy ; and as&#xD;
at the time he was found no one happened to be&#xD;
in the inn but themselves, no' one knew how the&#xD;
child came there ; and it was very easy for the&#xD;
dame to say that it was one they had adopted,&#xD;
without entering into particulars. So he grew&#xD;
up, not so much as an adopted child, as an own&#xD;
child, and by most persons he was considered&#xD;
their own son.&#xD;

, HE young student having soon lost sight&#xD;
- of the inn which was hidden from him by&#xD;
a turn in the road, along which he was walking&#xD;
and which followed the windings of the river,&#xD;
marched along with a free and cheerful air.-&#xD;
The walk he had taken nearly 'every Sunday&#xD;
evening for three years past ; for as the univer-&#xD;
sity lay but about eight miles from the inn, in a&#xD;
northerly direction, he came home every Satur-&#xD;
day and passed the following day with his pa-&#xD;
rents, as he called the honest inn-keeper Da-&#xD;
vid and his sensible, strong-minded dame.&#xD;
It Was a pleasant autumnal evening. The&#xD;
west was golden-hued, mingled with purple&#xD;
and apple-green tints. A few lances of crimson&#xD;
clouds with banners folded about them, as they&#xD;
seemed to be, were crossed above the sun, which&#xD;
was setting in an aerial ocean of fire. The clear&#xD;
stream, which he always regarded with a strange&#xD;
feeling of affection and mysterious awe, recol-&#xD;
lecting how he had been found floating upon it,&#xD;
glided past at his side, blushing with the roses&#xD;
which it stole from the western heavens. A few&#xD;
birds were hopping from tree to furze, carolling&#xD;
&#xD;
their vespers to the departing day, and high Tn&#xD;
the air with balanced wings sailed the sea hawk&#xD;
oceanward. There was a Sabbath stillness in&#xD;
the air, that absence of the sounds of labor&#xD;
which stir the atmosphere during the six days of&#xD;
the toiling week.&#xD;
Edward marched on, light-hearted and happy.&#xD;
He knew not a care, he experienced not a fear&#xD;
or an apprehension.. He had all that his heart&#xD;
could desire. He had a pleasant home, was be-&#xD;
loved by David and the good dame as if he were&#xD;
their flesh and blood ; he had sufficient money&#xD;
at all times to meet his wishes, and luxuries and&#xD;
pleasures he cared little for ; his rank as a stu-&#xD;
dent in the university was enviably high; he&#xD;
was. popular among those whose esteem and&#xD;
friendship were truly desirable ; and he had&#xD;
the confidence of the professors to whose de-&#xD;
partment he belonged. He had not an enemy&#xD;
that he knew of on earth. Why then should ho&#xD;
not feel and be happy ; and show that he was&#xD;
so by his cheery air and elastic tread, and&#xD;
humming in a mellow key the air of some favor-&#xD;
ite piece. All nature reflected his happiness;&#xD;

and he saw in all around him, in the beauty of&#xD;
the skies, the splendor of the sun, the verdant&#xD;
mantles of the forests, the green sward beneath,&#xD;
the clear river, the gray rocks, the winds, the&#xD;
very air he breathed, causes for gratitude to the&#xD;
Giver of all these good gifts.&#xD;
There were, however, depths and sources of&#xD;
happiness which he wot not of, and which he did&#xD;
not suspect ! There were abysses in his soul&#xD;
that he knew not existed, and in whose depths&#xD;
are found diamonds of joy that his experience&#xD;
had never discovered. He had never been in&#xD;
love ! He was, therefore, not perfectly happy ;&#xD;
or rather he was happy only up to his knowl-&#xD;
edge ; he'enjoyed that bliss which only the ig-&#xD;
norance of what is still more blissful makes per-&#xD;
fection.&#xD;
At length he reached the foot of the cliff or&#xD;
rock on the top of which were the ruins of the&#xD;
old English church. Here the road turned&#xD;
short and wound for full half a mile quite around&#xD;
the estate which we have before described, and&#xD;
which was called Grasmere Grove, the residence&#xD;
of the late General Washington Lawrence.-&#xD;
Edward, however, instead of going round as&#xD;
he sometimes did when the hour was earlier,&#xD;
now left the road, and ascended the cliff by a&#xD;
path once used by the inhabitants of a former&#xD;
day when they sought the place of prayer. It&#xD;
was now wild and overgrown, and butlittle used&#xD;
save by a chance traveller, who, like our hero,&#xD;
might wish to shorten the way by taking the&#xD;
path in front of the Grasmere lawn.&#xD;
Upon reaching the top of the eminence he&#xD;
paused to survey the landscape in the light of&#xD;
the rich sunset glow. The first frost of autumn&#xD;
had already turned the foliage of the maple into&#xD;
crimson flakes, and dyed the oak and poplar with&#xD;
the hues of the orange ; and he could not but&#xD;
delay, near as night was, to indulge his innate&#xD;
love for the beautiful, by taking a hurried glance&#xD;
of the landscape. In order the better to see&#xD;
and widen the range of his eye, he climbed a&#xD;
portion of the ruins where the chancel had stood,&#xD;
*and east his eyes about him. To the south, the&#xD;
Charles wound in every variation of the line oi&#xD;
beauty till it was lost amid the landscape; andc&#xD;
&#xD;
YNYARD.&#xD;
&#xD;
everywhere above the trees that embosomed it&#xD;
was visible the roofs, or cupolas, or turrets of&#xD;
villas in every style, from the Grecian and Ital-&#xD;
ian to the Gothic and Swiss. To the east, full&#xD;
six miles off, he saw the mountain-like city of&#xD;
Boston crowned with its lofty capitol and ser-&#xD;
rated with a hundred heaven-piercing spires, all&#xD;
dimly and softly visible through a delicate veil&#xD;
of azure haze.  North of the metropolis his eye&#xD;
detected the obelisk of granite which " first'&#xD;
catches the morning beams, and whereon lights&#xD;
the last radiance of the setting day !"  Farther&#xD;
to the west, and in the direction in which his&#xD;
path lay, he could discern the graceful spires&#xD;
and lofty roofs of the university towering above&#xD;
the trees that engrove its scholastic walks.'&#xD;
" How many young men have gone forth&#xD;
from those shades of lore to fall in the strife of&#xD;
life with every hope, crushed !  So it may be&#xD;
with me !" was his reflection. "All my ambi-&#xD;
tious aspirations may become chaff; and, instead&#xD;
of leaving my name as a proud legacy to my&#xD;
country, it may be forgotten in another genera-.&#xD;
tion that I was even ever an inmate of yonder&#xD;
noble pile.  But I will not think so !  I will&#xD;
believe that the future will open bright as it&#xD;
now appears, and that the students of the uni-&#xD;
versity a hundred years hence shall remember&#xD;
with honor that I was educated there.  So it&#xD;
shall be, if a stout heart and a firm purpose and&#xD;
trust in Heaven can accomplish anything !"&#xD;
As he spoke these words his eye kindled and&#xD;
his whole form dilated with a nobler outline, as&#xD;
it yielded to the aspiring outbreathings of the&#xD;
spirit within. But all at once his brow colored&#xD;
with all the blood of his heart, for he had utter-&#xD;
ed his words aloud, supposing himself to be&#xD;
alone, when looking down into the chancel he&#xD;
saw standing in the window out of which she&#xD;
had been leaning, a young lady who was regard-&#xD;
ing him with curiosity and surprise. That she had&#xD;
evidently heard every word he had uttered, he&#xD;
saw by the expression of her beautiful face,&#xD;
which betrayed an embarrassed consciousness.-.-&#xD;
For a moment he stood returning her regards,&#xD;
f too confused to speak; but recovering himself,&#xD;
Ihe smiled, as if at himself, and lifting his cap&#xD;
he said:&#xD;

"Pardon me, but I believed myself to be&#xD;
alone ! I think I have the honor of seeing Miss&#xD;
Lawrence."&#xD;
The young lady bowed, and seemed to be sur&#xD;
priced that he knew her name, yet she was&#xD;
plainly gratified to be recognized by the hand-&#xD;
some stranger;,but in return her finely expres-&#xD;
sive eyes seemed to ask who he was.&#xD;
" You do not know -me," he said, under-&#xD;
standing the look, while he felt a desire to have&#xD;
some excuse to linger and see more of one so&#xD;
lovely ; for until that moment he did not believe&#xD;
that woman could be so beautiful as she seemed&#xD;
to him. It is only new-bornlove that can trans-&#xD;
late female beauty and make it intelligible.-&#xD;
Till then her loveliness passes before him like&#xD;
the printed page of an unknown language,making&#xD;
no impression either upon the heart or the mind.&#xD;
But one emotion of that sympathy out of which&#xD;
love grows renders the language of beauty in&#xD;
telligible to the soul. Without this talismanic&#xD;
love, woman is a book beautifully bound but in&#xD;
an unknown tongue.&#xD;
"I should be pleased," she said, smiling en&#xD;
chantingly, and speaking in the frank manner of&#xD;
one who is superior to all affectation, and thinks&#xD;
and acts without guile, "to know who you are&#xD;
since, you have called me by name'?"&#xD;
"Perhaps I was rude to take the liberty o&#xD;
speaking your name, for it is some years since]&#xD;
last saw you. I was then a boy, and you hav&#xD;
of course forgotten me; but I have never for&#xD;
gotten, I could never forget you."&#xD;
This was said, so naturally, so warmly front&#xD;
the heart, that she dropped her eyes to the pave&#xD;
flpor in beautiful confusion.  He admired th&#xD;
splendor of her beauty, the flowing grace of he&#xD;
robes and form, her dark hair bound up behind&#xD;
yet bursting in rich luxurianc3 firom the fillet&#xD;
waved with the negligence of native-grace about&#xD;
her moulded shoulders ; and as she stole a glance&#xD;
towards him, he wondered at the fire of he&#xD;
eyes, and that the delicately fringed lid could&#xD;
conceal or reveal at pleasure so much splendor&#xD;
but be was pleased to see. that maidenly mild&#xD;
ness tempered their impassioned vivacity.&#xD;
" You are very kind to remember me," sh&#xD;
&#xD;
rNYARD.                                 17&#xD;
said, recovering from her surprise at the earnest&#xD;
words that fell upon her ears ; " are you not Ed-&#xD;
ward Blacklock I"&#xD;
"Yes. I am not then forgotten ei tirely, I&#xD;
see, Miss Lawrence. I welcome you nome,&#xD;
and trust that your future will be as bright as&#xD;
the present promises." He then turned and&#xD;
wished her a formal "good evening," and was&#xD;
going down the cliffside to proceed on his wpy,&#xD;
whon she said, smiling:&#xD;
"I heard your soliloquy, Mr. Blacklock.--&#xD;
Let me be permitted to believe that your hopes&#xD;
of distinction will be fully realized. One who&#xD;
can speak as you have, must possess the energy&#xD;
" to render himself both great and good."&#xD;
"Thanks, Miss Isa-, I should say Miss&#xD;
Lawrence."&#xD;
" You need not have corrected yourself," she&#xD;
said, with frank sympathy. "How changed you&#xD;
are in six years?  I now see the boy in the&#xD;
man. But I should never have recognized you.&#xD;
Do you remember the squirrel you caught and&#xD;
presented to me ?"&#xD;
 " Iremember well how happy your accept-&#xD;
f ance of it made me at the time," said Edward,&#xD;
s his fine face lighting up with those pleasant&#xD;
memories of the past of which she had so agreea-&#xD;
bly touched the key.&#xD;
f   " And how I wept because Tiger, brother's&#xD;
I dog, caught it and tore it to pieces. And do&#xD;
e you remember the time I broke through the ice&#xD;
slidingdirectly opposite, this spot and you caught&#xD;
inc as I was sinking through, while Manfred&#xD;

blushing.  "I am sure I have quite forgotten&#xD;

" I have not ; and here it is," he added, tak-&#xD;

" What? You have not been so foolish as+&#xD;
to keep it'?" she said, but looking rather pleas-&#xD;
ed than offended.&#xD;
4ifhave never parted with it for a moment.&#xD;
It remains with you now to say whether I shall&#xD;
retain it."&#xD;
"4Certainly. If I gave it to you then, I eon-&#xD;
firm the gift now,for I see no reason to revoke it."&#xD;
"I will always keep it then.  It has been a&#xD;
living reinembrancer of you."&#xD;
"Do you remember the circumstances under&#xD;
which I gave it to you'?" she asked, dropping&#xD;
her eyes, but smiling beneath the'lids, while she&#xD;
tapped the stone floor with the point of her lit-&#xD;
tle foot.&#xD;
" Perfectly. It was six years ago, the eve of&#xD;
your departure to a boarding-school.  You were&#xD;
then in your thirteenth year, and I not but a&#xD;
couple of years older. I had come to give&#xD;
you a robin red-breast to take to town, as I had&#xD;
heard you say you wanted one to make a pres-&#xD;
ent of to your sister.  I made the cage my-&#xD;
self with my penknife, and I was a happy&#xD;
workman while I was about it, because I knew&#xD;
how it would please you."&#xD;
"And it did please me, I remember well."&#xD;
"And then you gave me this ring, taking it&#xD;
off of your fore-finger and saying: " Take this&#xD;
ring, Edward, to remember me by !"&#xD;
"I recollect it," answered the maiden, with&#xD;
a pleasant, conscious laugh, while her beauty&#xD;
was enriched by a mantling blush. But to show&#xD;
you I have not been more neglectful of child-&#xD;
hood days than you seem to have been, I beg&#xD;
leave to inform you- but I am doing a very&#xD;
foolish thing ! But it is only for old times we&#xD;
are so freely talking, so, I will tell you that I&#xD;
have kept the cage."&#xD;
" Kept the little wooden cage'? It was not&#xD;
worth a thought after you had got the robin to&#xD;
Boston, where you could get a gilt one."&#xD;
" And agilt one was bought ; but I kept the&#xD;
cage, and have it yet ; and I would not part&#xD;
with it for a great deal, it is such an old friend."&#xD;
There was an agreeable light beaming in Ed-&#xD;
ward Blacklock's eyes as he heard these words.&#xD;
He regarded her for an instant with feelings ofl&#xD;
&#xD;
emotion and gratitude, but so mixed with pleas&#xD;
ure and joy, and with be knew not what form of&#xD;
wild hopes, that he did not dare to venture a re-&#xD;
ply. He felt that his voice would betray emo-&#xD;
tions which he ought not to have suspected. He&#xD;
felt grateful that the fair 'playmate of his boy-&#xD;
hood so pleasantly remembered the past, and so&#xD;
happily alluded to them, while he wondered that&#xD;
the haughty reserve which for three or four years&#xD;
past had marked her brother Manfred's conduct&#xD;
towards him, had not been shared in by the no-&#xD;
ble looking and beautiful sister. " She at least&#xD;
does not despise me for my humble estate," he&#xD;
said to himself, with inward gratification. 0,&#xD;
how lovely she has become ! How pure and no-&#xD;
ble seems to be her whole character. How free&#xD;
from affectation ! and that she should have kept&#xD;
the little cage ! But it was only aremembrance&#xD;
of home, not of me!/ Down, ambitious heart !&#xD;
Quiet, high aspirations ! Such thoughts must,&#xD;
die ere they take root. I will dismiss them at&#xD;
once and forever with the bold moment that&#xD;
gave them birth !"  He then added aloud:&#xD;
" Miss Lawrence, I fear I am trespassing on&#xD;
your time. As I have to walk to the college to-&#xD;
night, I will leave you to the seclusion which I&#xD;
have intruded upon. But I was not aware that&#xD;
I should find any one here ; and I took this way&#xD;
to save the longer walk around by the road."&#xD;
"I am very glad I met you. I asked my&#xD;
brother about you last week,-but he said helhad&#xD;
not seen you to speak with you for a long time."&#xD;
"He says truly. We meet daily in college,&#xD;
but for three or four years we have not inter-&#xD;
changed words, I believe."&#xD;
" And are you at feud with him ?"&#xD;
" Nay. I have only the kindest feelings to-&#xD;
wards him ; and had I reason for any other, I&#xD;
could not, after the friendly manner you have&#xD;
met me to-day and renewed our childhood ac-&#xD;
quaintance so frankly. I could not,after this for&#xD;
your sake, think unkindly of him. I fear it&#xD;
is your brother, who finds the son of an innkeep-&#xD;
er not exactly the associate he should select in&#xD;
his manhood 1"&#xD;
"I trust he has not such feelings."&#xD;
" I may do him wrong. But since I have&#xD;
&#xD;
never given him any occasion for treating me&#xD;
coldly, I am at a loss to attribute it to any oth-&#xD;
er cause."&#xD;
" Yes, it may be so. Manfred is haughty and&#xD;
sensitive. But I will see that you are friends&#xD;
again!"&#xD;
" Not for the world, Miss Isabel. I have&#xD;
pride, also, and I would not have him compelled&#xD;
out of regard to you to endure a companionship&#xD;
with one whom he would not voluntarily retain&#xD;
as his friend."°&#xD;
" Then I will say nothing.  I am sorry for&#xD;
this. You were once such good friends."&#xD;
"That," answered Edward, with a slight&#xD;
tremor of his finely chiselled lips, "was before he&#xD;
was taught by the prejudices of society the wide&#xD;
distinction that exists between the son of Gen-&#xD;
eral Lawrence and the son of David Blacklock&#xD;
the innkeeper.&#xD;
The young man spoke with calmness and self-&#xD;
respect, so that she sympathized with him as if&#xD;
she saw clearly his position. For a moment or&#xD;
two she stood thoughtful and silent, and looking&#xD;
down as if much distressed. - At length she&#xD;
looked up to make some remark which from the&#xD;
expression of her eyes was to have been both&#xD;
kindly and an expression of her own esteem,&#xD;
when the place where he stood was vacant; and&#xD;
gazing down the steep she saw  him  hurrying&#xD;
along the bank of the river on his way to the&#xD;
university. The next moment a group of bend-&#xD;
ing trees hid him from sight._&#xD;
" There goes a proud and manly spirit, who&#xD;
I know is worthy of all confidence and respect.&#xD;
Yes, he is right. Manfred disdains to associate&#xD;
with his old playmate. But is he not worthy?&#xD;
What a noble figure and bearing,that might mate&#xD;
him with the lords of England ! What an in.&#xD;
genuous expression of truth and candor in his&#xD;
face. What spirit tempered by modest diffi-&#xD;
dence, in the light of his clear, expanding eyes.&#xD;
How handsome he is too !  Ah, Manfred, thou&#xD;
art surely casting aside a treasure, in casting&#xD;
aside this young Edward Blacklock, because he&#xD;
is of humble Qrigin !" At this instant, a squir-&#xD;
rel running along the wall of the ruins, stopped&#xD;
directly above her head. A report of a gun&#xD;
&#xD;
was heard a few feet from her and the little ani-&#xD;
mal fell dead at her feet, while with a half shriek&#xD;
she sorted from the spot which had become&#xD;
so nearly fatal to her. She had hardly time to&#xD;
realize that she was not killed or at least wound-&#xD;
ed by the ball which had whiz ed close above&#xD;
her head, when Manfred leaped through a ruin-&#xD;
ous window behind her, his smoking gun in his&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
" You nearly made me your target, brother,"&#xD;
she said, in a slight tone of reproof.&#xD;
He seemed surprised if not startled at seeing&#xD;
her there, and then satisfying himself by a clos-&#xD;
er scrutiny that she was not hit, he said in a&#xD;
careless tone :&#xD;
" Girls should not be about old ruins if they&#xD;
don't want to be taken for squirrels. How dids&#xD;
I know you were here'? I supposed you were&#xD;
at church."&#xD;
" We have been returned from church more&#xD;
than an hour, and I walked down here to enjoy&#xD;
the sunset view. Do you remember how we&#xD;
used to climb this ruin when children? It&#xD;
doesn't seem to be so high as it appeared then."&#xD;
" No, I took some of the stone to have that&#xD;
boat pier built," answered the young hunter,&#xD;
pointing with the squirrel in his hand to a little&#xD;
wharf below, where was moored a green painted&#xD;
sail boat.&#xD;
"It ought not to have been disturbed, Man-&#xD;
fred. It is sacred, and it is so associated with&#xD;
our earlier years, that I love every stone. Do&#xD;
you recollect when we had a picnic here, and&#xD;
you insisted on dining off the communion table,&#xD;
but I prevailed to have the dinner on this slab'?&#xD;
Edward Blacklock was one of the party. I&#xD;
saw him a few minutes ago."&#xD;
" I hope you did not renew your former ac-&#xD;
quaintance with him," said Manfred, with a&#xD;
quick, hostile tone and look, that harmonized&#xD;
with the passionate and fiery character of his&#xD;
features.&#xD;
"Indeed, I was very glad to see him," she&#xD;
said, quietly. " He looks remarkably well, and&#xD;
has grown so noble looking and handsome."&#xD;
" Humi Did you shake hands with him'?"&#xD;
"0O, no," answered Isabel, laughing. " We&#xD;

&#xD;
met almost as strangers, and if I hadn't pro-&#xD;
longed the interview he would have vanished at&#xD;
once."&#xD;
"I hope you will never recognize him again,"&#xD;
said Manfred, with haughty displeasure.&#xD;
" I see no objection to doing so," she replied&#xD;
pleasantly, but with a spice of native indepen.&#xD;
deuce, which she got from the General, her father.&#xD;
" He is certainly the finest looking young man&#xD;
I ever saw."&#xD;
" Your notions of fine looks differ essentially&#xD;
from mine, Isabel.  You seem to forget who he&#xD;
is'?"&#xD;
" A student of the university I think he told&#xD;
me."&#xD;
" An innkeeper's son. He is too low for&#xD;
you or I to notice.  Why I have thrown the fel-&#xD;
low the bridle of my horse to hold within the&#xD;
year, out of pure scorn, and to teach him that I&#xD;
knew his place."&#xD;
"And did he strike you ?"&#xD;
"He !   No, no !  He held my horse."&#xD;
"He did !"&#xD;
"To be sure it was a little sarcastic in the&#xD;
fellow, his doing so."&#xD;
"You ought to have been ashamed of your-&#xD;
self, Manfred, thus unprovoked to insult a fel-&#xD;
low-student and early playmate, because he does&#xD;
not happen to be born precisely in the same con-&#xD;
dition of society of yourself. His birth is&#xD;
nothing against him."&#xD;
"I do believe if the fellow should hear you,&#xD;
he'd be encouraged to fall in love with you."&#xD;
"Ahime !" she sighed, with a mischievous&#xD;
smile, " I fear no such good luck. Here I've&#xD;
been three weeks from boarding school and no&#xD;
one has proposed to me ! I should be so flat.&#xD;
tered, brother, to know that I was good looking&#xD;
enough to be fallen in love with."&#xD;
" You are at your old badinage, I see.  But&#xD;
let him go ! He is not worth wasting words&#xD;
upon. I only entreat that if he has the impu-&#xD;
dence to take advantage of your recognition of&#xD;
him, you would check him with a little of your&#xD;
hauteur.  Which way was he going'?"&#xD;
"He told me towards the university."&#xD;
" Yes. He comes home every week and&#xD;
&#xD;
stays Saturday and Sunday to save two days&#xD;
meals in commons, he is so poor !"&#xD;
" I wish I were now rich, I would save him&#xD;
from this censure, brother, by making him a&#xD;
present of a thousand dollars."&#xD;
" You must be mad ! or else you are trying&#xD;
to see how far you can annoy me when you see&#xD;
I like him not."&#xD;
" 1 am not mad, but only grateful. If I&#xD;
gave him half my fortune, I should but be pay-&#xD;
ing him a part of a debt I can never repay.--&#xD;
Have you forgotten that I owe my life to him'?"&#xD;
"Poh! hundreds of lives have been saved."&#xD;
" And did I have a hundred lives, I should&#xD;
not feel so gratefully as I do the safety of one ;&#xD;
but as I have but one life, I feel proportionably&#xD;
thankful to him who has preserved it."&#xD;
" You will cause me to kill that fellow yet,&#xD;
Isabel !" he exclaimed, quite thrown off his&#xD;
guard and uttering, unmasked, all his mind.&#xD;
"Manfred, brother!" she cried, looking at&#xD;
him  with severe reproof.  "You know not&#xD;
what you say!"&#xD;
"Then do not name him to me again !"&#xD;
"Ah! something more than dislike of one&#xD;
beneath you in his birth lies at the bottom of all&#xD;
this, brother ! What has Edward done to thee,&#xD;
to rouse thy worst passions'?"&#xD;
" No matter, no matter ! Let it suffice that&#xD;
I hate him; and if you speak to him -.--"&#xD;
"Do you threaten me, also, brother'?"&#xD;
"Forgive me !  But if he dares to speak&#xD;
with you again, he crosses my path after to his&#xD;
sorrow.  Come, do not stay here ! Let us go&#xD;
home. The sun is setting. Nay, you look an-&#xD;
gry. Wake up !   I have had no luck to-day&#xD;
and came here in ill-humor."  He pressed his&#xD;
lip to her cheek ; and she strove to recover her-&#xD;
self; but his dark and threatening language,&#xD;
the evil light which shone in his eyes,had chilled&#xD;
for the moment the warm fountain of her affee-&#xD;
- tion ; and they had reached the villa before she&#xD;
f could resume her wonted manner towards him.&#xD;
In the meantime the unconscious student of&#xD;
. this excitement, of this attack and defence, pur-&#xD;
sued his solitary way, carrying in his heart the&#xD;
Sweet traces of the pleasant interview in the&#xD;
&#xD;
ruin. To say that he had fallen in love with&#xD;
her on the spot would not be so near the real&#xD;
state of the case, as to say that he had loved&#xD;
her from childhood, and only now renewed and&#xD;
revived from deeper emotions this early child-&#xD;
hood attachment. Neither knew then, in those&#xD;
free, heart-innocent, thought-innocent days, that&#xD;
they were lovers in the bud.. Neither under-&#xD;
stood that the little wooden cage so industrious-&#xD;
ly made held Cupid as well as the robin, and&#xD;
that love shaped, worked out and completed the&#xD;
whole, and even caught the robin, and bore it&#xD;
to her ; nor did either then suspect or under-&#xD;
stand that the giving and accepting the ring was&#xD;
a juvenile passage of love, that only wanted&#xD;
age and occasion to produce all the fruits of the&#xD;
profoundest passion. And neither had the re-&#xD;
motest idea that the- careful cherishing of the&#xD;
ring were continual outward signs of the exis-&#xD;
tence'of the inward regard. But even with all&#xD;
these seeds that time might or might not ripen, if&#xD;
they had never met again neither would have lived&#xD;
or died pining or broken-hearted, but doubtless&#xD;
without any especial misgiving would have loved&#xD;
and married some other mate. But their pres-&#xD;
ent re-meeting at precisely the age they now both&#xD;
were, with the advantages to aid a mutual pas-&#xD;
sion which came from all the past with its sweet&#xD;
associations, it seems irresistible that the frail&#xD;
chord broken six years ago; should not be re-&#xD;
united in the interview, and become a living vine&#xD;
to wind around both their hearts and draw them&#xD;
closer to each other in its encircling folds.&#xD;
The meeting, therefore, at this juncture was&#xD;
destined to influence their future destinies, if&#xD;
we may judge from the character of it and the&#xD;
sentiments which it developed. Yet neither sus-&#xD;
pected the truth. Edward had no idea that the&#xD;
new emotion which he felt as he walked along,&#xD;
proceeded from any other cause than pleasura-&#xD;
ble emotion at meeting with an old playmate and&#xD;
at her frank and cordial recognition; while she,&#xD;
as after reaching her room, she recalled the ex-&#xD;
pression of his features and voice, little suspect-&#xD;
ed that she was thereby influenced by other&#xD;
emotions than friendship. But we, who are&#xD;
perhaps older and understand these .things bet-&#xD;
2'&#xD;
&#xD;
ter than they do, are not at a loss to discover&#xD;
[ that at this meeting the friendship.of childhood&#xD;
I became converted into the magic charm of lovg.&#xD;
Edward had reaclied that point of the road&#xD;
where it leaves the i'iver to strike across a mea-&#xD;
dow to the turnpike-road, when he saw a barge&#xD;
stealing close to the shore and half-obscured in&#xD;
the shadows of a row of willows that grew on&#xD;
the bank. It was now quite sunset, for he had&#xD;
delayed some time at the river, yet-light enough&#xD;
for him to see that there were five men in the&#xD;
boat, four rowing and one in the' stern steer-&#xD;
ing. It was so common a thing to see boats&#xD;
on the river that he was passing on his way, fol-&#xD;
lowing the diverging angle of the road, when&#xD;
he was hailed by the man in the stern.&#xD;
"Ho, shipmate, a word with you !"&#xD;
He paused and the man stepping ashore drew&#xD;
near towards him. Edward saw that he was&#xD;
dressed in a seaman's blue jacket and wore a&#xD;
palmetto hat, as if he had recently come from&#xD;
tropical latitudes. He was about eight and&#xD;
twenty years of age, rather short but compactly&#xD;
made, and having dark features. Altogether&#xD;
his appearance was that of a man whose home&#xD;
was on the sea rather than on the land, and who&#xD;
had sailed long beneath torrid suns. His gait&#xD;
was nautical and had that careless, independent&#xD;
swing which is inimitable by any landsman-&#xD;
Edward was pleased rather than otherwise with&#xD;
his appearance, though his face, though good-&#xD;
natured,-had in it a dash of hardihood that show-&#xD;
ed he would be a dangerous enemy to deal with,&#xD;
as well as likely to be a firm friend.&#xD;
" What can I do for you'?' asked Edward,&#xD;
as he surveyed the man's features, in which he&#xD;
fancied he saw a resemblance to some one whom&#xD;
he knew.&#xD;
"I am a stranger in these seas, shipmate,"&#xD;
replied the man, "and you will do me a favor by&#xD;
telling me what course to steer, for Brown Bear&#xD;
tavern.' I'm afraid I've overhauled it, as they&#xD;
told me 'twas but a league, and by the time I've&#xD;
been under way, I must have missed it."&#xD;
" No. You have nearly another mile to row,&#xD;
sir, and you will see it on the right bank asyou&#xD;

know so much abqut it, can you tell me if there&#xD;
is a young gentleman there by the name of Ed-&#xD;

"Blacklock," answered Edward, who was&#xD;
puzzling his head all the while to trace the re-&#xD;
semblance to some one he saw in his: face.&#xD;
"That is the name, master !"&#xD;
"Are you going up to David Blacklock's inn&#xD;
to see this young man?"-&#xD;
"For nothing else."&#xD;
"Then I will save you the trouble of going&#xD;
farther, for I axpi the person."&#xD;

" No. I am the young man of that name."&#xD;

blooming and beautiful, with a step as free as&#xD;
health and symmetry could make it. The sweet&#xD;
dependence ~ of the invalid mother upon her&#xD;
child, and the protecting and affectionate air of&#xD;
the latter as she carefully led her along, care-&#xD;
fully avoiding every pebble against which she&#xD;
might strike her foot, was also noticed by those&#xD;
who observed them.&#xD;
"Ah," said a sympathizing dame who was&#xD;
standing by the church door gossiping with a&#xD;
neighbor as mother and 'daughter entered the&#xD;
porch, " ah, Dame Wynyard looks mighty sight&#xD;
worse every Sabba' day I see her ! Poor wo-&#xD;
man, she has never lifted up her face since her&#xD;
son Wat ranoff to sea!"&#xD;
"-he takes on mightily 'bout it, though she&#xD;
don't talk 'bout hint since that sailor three years&#xD;
ago came home and told such a tale 'about&#xD;
him."&#xD;
" I don't believe it was ever true," answered&#xD;
her gossip.&#xD;
"There is no knowin'. . Folks as goes to the&#xD;
world's end can do orful things there, and then&#xD;
come back here as innocent as 'deacons, and&#xD;
who is the wiser ?" said the other, shaking her.&#xD;
head.&#xD;
"Did you see how fine and handsome Miss&#xD;
Katy is growed'? It strikes me she dresses too&#xD;
smart for a poor widow's daughter what lives by&#xD;
her needle."&#xD;
"Katy is as good as she is purty ; and she's&#xD;
right, I'm thinkin', to wear what she works&#xD;
for," answered the woman, quickly.&#xD;
"Well, well, I only hope , she wont come to&#xD;
anything out o' the way, 'you know !  There's&#xD;
plenty o' these rich wild young students as.,&#xD;
might turn her head if they took a fancy. I&#xD;
see 'em looking arter her al'ays when she goes&#xD;
out or comes in to church," Here she drew a&#xD;
long sigh.&#xD;
" They'll never do her any harm. It's nat'-&#xD;
ral for young men to look after a pretty face,&#xD;
let it belong to gentle or simple," answered the&#xD;
other, walking info the porch, as the bell ceased&#xD;
to toyl.&#xD;
After service was over the young girl who&#xD;
hzad been the cause of this gossiping, came out&#xD;
&#xD;
after the crowd had thinned, her mother as usu-&#xD;
al leaning upon her arm, a sweet picture of £1-&#xD;
ial reverence. The mother was dressed:in a&#xD;
plain, neat suit of mourning, in a ,silk. black&#xD;
bonnet, with a small ruffied .cap encircling, her&#xD;
face, and giving her a respectable and lady-like&#xD;
air. She bent over as she walked, her placid,&#xD;
sorrowful face bent pensively to the, ground.&#xD;
She assisted her steps with a black stic ,.well&#xD;
polished with long use. Catharine m o , light-&#xD;
ly and gently by her side, a head taller than&#xD;
her bent-down mother. She wore a straw hat&#xD;
pf the most becoming shape, trimmed with blue&#xD;
ribbon, 'and adorned--for it was the month of&#xD;
June-with a- pretty little, bouquet of fesh&#xD;
flowers. Her face,, seen beneath the .bpnrmet,&#xD;
was the most beautiful that ever a pottage hat&#xD;
shaded. Her eyes were a soft, violt blue,&#xD;
large and frank in their open look;' apmd her&#xD;
finely shaped nose, and rosy mouth,, sad 4n.&#xD;
pled chin, to say nothing of her rosy cheeks&#xD;
and pure complexion, formed a face of surpassing&#xD;
loveliness. There was not too much softness in&#xD;
it, as is often the case with the soft, blge-eyed&#xD;
class of girls, but there was a dash 'of high&#xD;
spirit in the bright light of her eyes at' times,&#xD;
that showed she possessed strength and energy&#xD;
of character, which, if called into action by&#xD;
sufficient occasion, would make a heroine of her.&#xD;
She was simply arrayed in white with a blue&#xD;
belt, and a neat bootee displayed the moulded&#xD;
shape of the perfection of foot and ankle. With&#xD;
all the heavenly expression'-of her countenance,&#xD;
as she leaned towards her mother, smiling and&#xD;
lovingly as she moved along with her, as if she&#xD;
knew no other joy than to administer to her&#xD;
happiness, this was her greatest charm.&#xD;
There were two young men watching her as&#xD;
she walked away from the church in the direc-&#xD;
tion of her cottage. One of them was Edward&#xD;
Blacklock, the other 1 anfred Lawrence. The&#xD;
.former seldom remained away from the inn on&#xD;
Sundays, but a severe storm the day before kept&#xD;
him in his rooms, and he was therefore at church&#xD;
with many other students on this day. Though'&#xD;
we have named only two who were observing the&#xD;
mother and daughter, there wore ether student.&#xD;

laughing. "Cupid sometimes shoots arrow&#xD;

and then tuning away frot'them, he made as&#xD;
lie was going towards the university ; but having&#xD;
'rocesee until he had lost sight of the paity&#xD;

fold 'return in a grateful smile, a grateful look,&#xD;
a grateful "'thank you, sir," from the daughter.&#xD;
There was something in the look, smile, and&#xD;
tone of voice, that impressed 'him and made' him&#xD;
feel a great desire to know who the younggirl&#xD;
was. But he had no opportunity' 'of inquiring&#xD;
then. After church he saw the i'come ot and&#xD;
prce    homeward,, and as there chanced- to&#xD;
stand near him a staid citizen of the town whom&#xD;
he knew, he asked him who they ware.&#xD;
" That is the "widow Wynyard and her&#xD;
daughter."&#xD;
"She is very infirm."&#xD;
" Yes. But I knew her, Master Blacklok,&#xD;
when she was the blithest and 'prettiest lass in&#xD;
all Cambridge. But she has seen sorrow. She&#xD;
married' a young fellow who was'too roving to&#xD;
settle down, and during -the last'war went pri-&#xD;
vateering and was lost or killed at sea in' the&#xD;
British- channel."'&#xD;
"And this is his daughter ?"&#xD;
"Yes. There was another-a'wild slip of a&#xD;
lad, just like his 'father. He was the mischief&#xD;
worker of the- neighborhood till 'his eighteenth&#xD;
year, when he suddenly ran away to sea=; 'and&#xD;
as a robbery of a gentleman of his pockefcbook&#xD;
took place the night before he wentwhy he left&#xD;

could be proved, as it was pitch dark 'when the,&#xD;

ad   "'Yes."&#xD;

he so that you can almost step into the boat from&#xD;

&#xD;
bines, with a somewhat curious old peaked&#xD;
chimney."&#xD;
"That is ,it. My tanyard is not far from it."&#xD;
dI have often passed the house going up and&#xD;
down ; but all was so quiet one would not know&#xD;
it was occupied."r&#xD;
" They live very secluded., They get a corn-&#xD;
fottable livelihood by embroidering straw. How&#xD;
is your father, Squire David Blacklock, young&#xD;
sir? I hope he fares well?"&#xD;
" Well, I thank you."&#xD;
" Do you walk towards the university ?"&#xD;
" Yes," answered Edward, and he walked&#xD;
by the. side of the communicative tanner until&#xD;
their roads separated, when he took his way to&#xD;
the college, thinking more of the sorrows of the&#xD;
widow than of the loveliness of her daughter.&#xD;
"I will call by there some evening," 'he -said,&#xD;
"and purchase a new straw bonnet for my good&#xD;
mother ; for I feel an interest in them .that I&#xD;
should like to have ripen to,acquaintance."&#xD;
Three or four days afterwards, about an hour&#xD;
before sunset, Edward was walking in one of&#xD;
the pleasant paths which in every direction in-&#xD;
tersect the grounds, about the university. His&#xD;
steps wandered in the direction of the Charles,&#xD;
when upon looking round he discovered, no&#xD;
very far distant down the river, the roof of the&#xD;
widow's cottage. He now recalled his promise&#xD;
to himself to call there and see them, and 'with-&#xD;
out further reflection he bent his course along&#xD;
the river side until he came close to the cottage,&#xD;
where, at a small paling gate, the path termi-&#xD;
nated. Here he paused to question the pro-&#xD;
priety of his intruding in so secluded a place,&#xD;
andhe was about to chide his.curiosity and turn&#xD;
away, when the young girl herself, who had&#xD;
been stooping down and engaged in trimming a&#xD;
little rose tree, which kept her quite unseen by&#xD;
I   him, rose up, hearing his retiring steps, and&#xD;
looked towards him.&#xD;
"will you come in, sir ?" she said, instantly&#xD;
recognizing him to be the young student who&#xD;
had prevented her mother from falling on Sun-&#xD;
day. She spoke with such frankness, and in&#xD;
such an agreeable way, that he could not resist;:&#xD;
anetamern    out a sort of aplgh   pn&#xD;
ed the _gate, saying :    aooy     eoe-&#xD;
&#xD;
"I hope your mother got safely home ?"&#xD;
"Quite so," she answered. "Will you walk&#xD;
in and see her. She has spoken of you two or&#xD;
three times."&#xD;
He entered the humble abode, where the&#xD;
widow was seated in an arm-chair, assorting&#xD;
long flat straws. Upon seeing him she quickly&#xD;
knew him, and said :&#xD;
" Catherine, get a chair.  I am glad to see&#xD;
you, sir. You will excuse our littered room,&#xD;
sir. We do not often have visitors."&#xD;
"I heard, madam, you braided bonnets, and&#xD;
I wish to have one made as a present from me&#xD;
to my mother. I am sure I could find nothing&#xD;
that would please her better."&#xD;
Here followed a conversation upon the kind&#xD;
of straw, whether coarse or fine, the fashion of&#xD;
the bonnet, the size of the head, &amp;amp;c., in all of&#xD;
which Edward very prominently manifested an&#xD;
ignorance that was quite masculine. At length,&#xD;
however, a bonnet was decided upon, and Ed-&#xD;
ward promised to bring the measure' of his&#xD;
mother's crown on the ensuing Monday. This&#xD;
affair being all arranged to his satisfaction, a very&#xD;
agreeable conversation now took place between&#xD;
Edward and the young lady upon flowers, of&#xD;
which the little garden held a countless variety.&#xD;
He made so kindly an impression upon them in&#xD;
the hour that he remained, that when he rose to&#xD;
leave, as twilight drew  on, the widow invited&#xD;
him to remain and take a- cup of tea, while&#xD;
Kate offered for his acceptance a charming bou-&#xD;
quet. He would gladly have remained, but he&#xD;
had duties at the college; and promising himself&#xD;
soon to repeat the agreeable visit, he took his.&#xD;
leave of them, and went on his way to the uni-&#xD;
versity, congratulating himself on having found&#xD;
two such interesting persons as the beautiful&#xD;
straw braider and her mother. He had not&#xD;
gone a third of the distance to the college, when&#xD;
he was met by Manfred Lawrence. It was al-&#xD;
most dark, yet he recognized him, though the&#xD;
latter seemed studiously to keep close to the&#xD;
fence, as if he did not wish to be recognized by&#xD;
any passers-by. Of coursehhe did not speak to&#xD;
him, for in the open noon, had they met in the&#xD;

KATE WYNYARD-               29&#xD;
&#xD;
have passed between them only a short formal&#xD;
nod, hardly enough for courtesy, yet too much&#xD;
for decided hostility ; for as yet Lawrence had&#xD;
not found reason to carry in his heart against&#xD;
Edward the deep hatred which afterwards took&#xD;
up its abode there.  Without casting a second&#xD;
thought after his former playmate, or suspecting&#xD;
anything from his manner of skulking, Edward&#xD;
took his way to his room, entered it, and gave&#xD;
himself till midnight to his books.&#xD;
And did not the sweet face of Kate Wynyard&#xD;
mingle with the Latin sentences, nor her tresses&#xD;
intertwine among the Greek roots, nor the tones&#xD;
of her voice take the place of the voices active&#xD;
and passive, nor her warm blue eyes peep at&#xD;
him through the fm    ork of his, diagrams?&#xD;
asks one of my  sceptible readers.  Not at all.&#xD;
He studied as  art whole as he ever had done ;&#xD;
and if he thought of the cottage at all it was of&#xD;
both its inmates, the pale cheek of the widow&#xD;
by the side of the rosy cheek of the maiden.&#xD;
When Manfred Lawrence had followed Cath-&#xD;
arine and her mother on the preceding Sunday,&#xD;
he managed so that without being seen by them&#xD;
to ascertain where they dwelt. He then waited&#xD;
until night-fall, and under cover of the dark-&#xD;
ness stole over the wall into the garden and ap-&#xD;
proached the low window, where he saw a light&#xD;
burning. It was their usual sitting-room, as&#xD;
he saw through the trellis of woodbine which&#xD;
curtained the window, and enabled him to look&#xD;
in without being . himself seen. He saw an&#xD;
oval tea table set out, and the lovely girl engag-&#xD;
ed in making tea. He watched her face, her&#xD;
every motion, and drank in the intoxication of&#xD;
her beauty. At length he beheld 'her place a&#xD;
chair for.her mother and carefully conduct her&#xD;
to the table, which was frugally spread.  But&#xD;
he was suddenly awed by seeing the maiden,&#xD;
after taking her seat, fold her hands together&#xD;
and.raise her eyes with the expression of a Ma-&#xD;
donna 'looking upward, .and ask the. Divine&#xD;
blessing.upon their humble board. For an in-&#xD;
stant he -shrunk from such purity and loveliness,&#xD;
&#xD;
and felt ashamed of being there and of his pur-&#xD;
pose. But he did not obey the impulse of his&#xD;
conscience to retire from a spot made sacred by&#xD;
being connected with heaven by the 'silver&#xD;
chord of prayer. The increased beauty which&#xD;
devotion lent to her features served :to bind him&#xD;
firmer to his purpose. And what was this pur-&#xD;
pose?  He hardly knew himself. He suffered&#xD;
his feelings to lead him as they would, without&#xD;
looking forward. It was enough for the moment&#xD;
to see her, and revel on the gaze 'f her loveliness&#xD;
unseen. At length, as they rose from the table&#xD;
and Catharine came towards the window to close&#xD;
the shutter, he retired and left this Eden, in&#xD;
which his entrance had doubtless been as evil&#xD;
in its purpose as that of Satan in Paradise. -:&#xD;
Circumstances prevented him from again vis-&#xD;
iting the cottage until the next Thursday even-&#xD;
ing, when we have, seen Edward, in coming&#xD;
from it, meet him. -He kept the road with a&#xD;
swift and cautious step, guardedly drawing near&#xD;
the fence if any one drew near ; and at length&#xD;
he came in sight of the cottage. All was quiet&#xD;
and peaceful. The place seemed the abode of&#xD;
innocence and virtue, if anywhere on earth.&#xD;
The moon rose as he reached the gate, and shone&#xD;
in golden radiance upon the white front and end&#xD;
of' the cottage, and falling upon the water in a&#xD;
path of light. The same candle beams shone&#xD;
through the little window. He drew near, and&#xD;
entering the unlocked gate, took his former&#xD;
place at the trellised window. They were both&#xD;
seated there sewing straw, with a light between&#xD;
them.  They were talking. He listened:&#xD;
"I am sure he is an.-excellent, young man,"&#xD;
said the widow.  "His very attention to a:poor&#xD;
widow shows it. Some of those students would&#xD;
have laughed at me instead of helping me when&#xD;
I was falling."&#xD;
"He spoke so kindly, as if you had been his&#xD;
own mother," said Catharine, "I am sure I&#xD;
shall always like him. I am so glad he called&#xD;
about the bonnet."       -&#xD;
"Ah, Kitty, dear, you mustn't be too glad,"&#xD;
&#xD;
said her mother, with a slow shake of her&#xD;
head.&#xD;
" Why not, dear mother ?"&#xD;
"Because it may lead you to be too lorrow-&#xD;
ful. You must let him coine, 'and say very lit-&#xD;
tle more to him, for I see-I see-"&#xD;
"See what, mother ?" asked the maiden,&#xD;
coloring deeply..&#xD;
" See that you think more of him than you&#xD;
ought to, considering that he is a student, and&#xD;
perhaps rich, and you are a poor sewing girl.&#xD;
Let me tell you that if you think of'him and he&#xD;
does not think of you, you will be very unhap-&#xD;
py. I tell you now in the beginning, for I&#xD;
think I see how your heart is working, and I&#xD;
am pained to see it, not that I do not think he&#xD;
is a suitable person for you to know, but&#xD;
your positions are such that he would never&#xD;
think of returning your affection ; in a word,&#xD;
my dear Katy, you and he could never be&#xD;
married."&#xD;
"Married, dear mother ! Who was dream-&#xD;
ing of such a thing ?"&#xD;
"I was, my child, under suitable circum-&#xD;
stances."&#xD;
" Well, I am sure I was not," answered&#xD;
Kate, with a merry laugh. "But I don't think&#xD;
there is any danger of my falling in love with&#xD;
any young man who would not condescend to&#xD;
fall in love with me," she, answered, gaily.&#xD;
" So when he comes I will leave you and he to&#xD;
settle the matter about the straw bonnet."&#xD;
«, lay, I do not object to your using proper&#xD;
eivuuy ; but you must take care of your heart,&#xD;
Kate. He is so ha     ifine, and interesting,&#xD;
and kind, that I should not blame you, and do&#xD;
not blame you, for liking him."&#xD;
"Why, mother, I have never said I liked&#xD;
him." -&#xD;
" Perhaps not. One doesn't always. need&#xD;
hear a girl's tongue in such a confession, if one&#xD;
looks first in her eyes."&#xD;
Here Kate dropped hers quickly, and a sec-&#xD;
ond time the rich carnation mantled cheek and&#xD;
&#xD;
r brow. Her mother saw this 'and sighed. At&#xD;
this moment there was a light tap at the door.&#xD;
It was Lawrence, 'who having in vain tried to&#xD;
ascertain of whom they were conversing, now&#xD;
applied for admission.&#xD;
" Who can it be so late ?" asked the widow,&#xD;
with a slightly startled look. "Open and see,&#xD;
Catharine."&#xD;
The young girl started back 'with an ex-&#xD;
clamation of alarm and a slight shriek, as she&#xD;
saw standing.in the door a young :,man in a&#xD;
hunter's dress, with his ' face spattered with&#xD;
blood, while he was supporting one arm by the&#xD;
other,'as if it were injured.'&#xD;
I" Do not be frightened, ladies. I have been&#xD;
hunting, and my gun went off and wounded&#xD;
me," he said, in a tone and in the manner of&#xD;
one suffering from a severe wound.&#xD;
. " 0, indeed, sir !" exclaimed Catharine, in&#xD;
a tone of sympathy. "Come in, sir. I hope&#xD;
you are not badly wounded."&#xD;
"I have come hither to see. I was hurt&#xD;
about sunset, and have only revived a little&#xD;
while since and been able to get here."&#xD;
The widow and Catharine, by every expres-&#xD;
sion of regret and compassion, showed how&#xD;
deeply they felt for him; and while one brought&#xD;
water and a towel to remove the blood, from his&#xD;
face, which he said had come from his wounded&#xD;
arm, the other prepared bandages. He, how-&#xD;
ever, as well he might, refused to have his arm&#xD;
touched or examined, saying that the pain was&#xD;
too much for him ; but if they would bind it up&#xD;
he would rest a little and then try to reach the&#xD;
college, when he .would send for a surgeon.&#xD;
The widow would have insisted on sending&#xD;
Catharine at once, but this he refused to per-&#xD;
mit ; and after he had remained half an hour&#xD;
and been refreshed by a glass of currant cor-&#xD;
dial, handed to him by the fair Catharine, who,&#xD;
as well as the mother, was wholly unsuspicious&#xD;
of the deception practised on them, he rose to&#xD;
go, and saying he thought he should be able to&#xD;
reach his rooms without any lifficulty. It was&#xD;

&#xD;
toning to him with those maiden blushes which&#xD;
betrayed a heart enthralled, she laughed and&#xD;
ran into the cottage, leaving him mortified and&#xD;
angry."&#xD;
All this while Edward had never met Man-&#xD;
fred there, having but seldom visited the cot.&#xD;
tage, and then usually by day, to ask after the&#xD;
welfare of the invalid mother. From them he&#xD;
had heard of the visits of the wounded student,&#xD;
but as he had never given his name he could&#xD;
not guess who it was, especially as he had never&#xD;
heard of any one being wounded by a gun. It&#xD;
chanced that the day on the evening of which&#xD;
we now see Lawrence land near the house, Ed-&#xD;
ward had met Catharine going from the town&#xD;
homeward. He joined her and walked nearly&#xD;
home with her. During this walk, in reply to&#xD;
a question from him, she had not,yet named the&#xD;
name of the young man who had been wounded ;&#xD;
"But," she added, " he is to bring me some&#xD;
books this evening, and if you will call you can&#xD;
then see him."&#xD;
"I have some curiosity to know who it is ;&#xD;
for I cannot learn that any student has been&#xD;
shot ' and, therefore, there seems to be a mys-&#xD;
tery about the affair that does not look well-&#xD;
Describe    !"&#xD;
"He'is ot so tall as you are, sir, nor so well&#xD;
formed.  He dresses very richly, has two large&#xD;
rings on his left hand, and carries; a black cane.&#xD;
His-eyes are very dark, his hair light brown,&#xD;
his fairs handsome,'but has an unpleasing ex-&#xD;
pression that:I lo not like. , Yet I do not find&#xD;
iu him anything unpleasant, to .fTnd fault with.&#xD;
He pretends," she added, laughing, "to be&#xD;
very much in love with me or mother."&#xD;
Will call this evening, Miss Catharine,"&#xD;
he answered'; "for in :your unprotected 'sitna-&#xD;
tion, you can't be too carefully watched over by&#xD;
your friends.'"-1&#xD;
" Indeed; sir; I wish you were our friend,"&#xD;
she answered, frankly. "Both mother"snd I&#xD;
would like to see you often:at'the cottage."&#xD;
I willat'the least, be there to-night," h(&#xD;
answered;' touching his hat, and :leaving he&#xD;
within eight of her home.&#xD;
The curiosity of Edward was very natural t4&#xD;
&#xD;
ascertain what student so regularly visited a&#xD;
house whose inmates so much interested him,&#xD;
especially as he could not learn that any one&#xD;
had been hurt. He b lieved, in his own mind,&#xD;
that, instead of a collegian, it was some person&#xD;
who pretended to be one, and under this guise&#xD;
sought to gain the confidence of the family;&#xD;
some low young man who could be nothing ex-&#xD;
cept in borrowed plumage. That it was a stu-&#xD;
dent, or that it was Lawrence, he had not the&#xD;
least suspicion.&#xD;
We now return to Manfred. He enteredthe&#xD;
cottage garden and, opening the door of the&#xD;
house, entered familiarly. The widow extended&#xD;
her hand and received him kindly, for in some&#xD;
sense she always looked upon him  as "the&#xD;
wounded young man," spoke of him as such,&#xD;
and seemed to regard him as if he still needed&#xD;
sympathy and kindness. Catharine did not give&#xD;
him her hand, but gently smiled and welcomed&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"No thanks, my good friend," he said, as he&#xD;
placed a parcel in her hand; "I have brought&#xD;
the books we talked about, fair Kate."&#xD;
"You are very kind,",she said, laying'them&#xD;
upon the table. ." Why do you hasten ?" a&#xD;
" I have an engagement which calls tme away&#xD;
at once. But, I came also to say that it will be&#xD;
many weeks before I shall see you agai."&#xD;
"Are you, then, going away, sir ?" asked&#xD;
the widow, in a tone of mingled surprise and re-&#xD;
gret.&#xD;
"Yes, my boat is now at the river bank."&#xD;
S "I hope you  have a pleasant journey, or&#xD;
voyage, which ever  be," said' Catharine,,in&#xD;
the indifferent tone which shows no feeling be-&#xD;
neath. It convinced him that he was=not loved&#xD;
by her, and, in his- thoughts, he almost cursed&#xD;
her coldaess, ashe termed her indifference to his&#xD;
staying or going.'&#xD;
"Thanks," he said. "It is a voyage across&#xD;
[the sea. If you will step to the door I will&#xD;
show you my boat.' It is a beautiful one'."&#xD;
e   " I can't well see its beauty in-thedark,,but&#xD;
r ,I will go, and look at it,'" she said, laughing:&#xD;
":Good-night, madam" hek said to therwid-&#xD;
o owed mother whose daughter ruin he wats plot-&#xD;
&#xD;
ting ; .and, taking her hand, he pressed it with,&#xD;
an appearance of respectful affection.&#xD;
He then left the cottage,i;followed by Cathar-&#xD;
ine, who very good naturedly went to oblige&#xD;
him, but taking the candle in her hand. Upon,&#xD;
reaching the boat,, and ere she could begin to&#xD;
look at it, he knocked the candle from her grasp,&#xD;
as if it had been accidental, and theh laughing,&#xD;
he said, taking her hand:&#xD;
"Never mind'the light ! Come into the boat,&#xD;
and let me have the: pleasure of rowing you -a&#xD;
little ways up the river and back again this fine&#xD;
star-light'night."&#xD;
Andbefore' he could decline, he;haddrawn}&#xD;
her into the boat by the hand, and at a signal&#xD;
from him, the two men pulled dut from the bank.&#xD;
Little suspecting their object 'she laughed and&#xD;
saiid :&#xD;
"You must not row away with me in this&#xD;
way. I have no wish to sail.  Row back with&#xD;
me.&#xD;
Give way, men 1" commanded Maafred, in&#xD;
a low, eager tone, while his heartbeat high and&#xD;
his pulse throbbed with the wildest tumult of&#xD;
mingled joy and'excitement of hope;, "Nay,&#xD;
Kate, do not -be so anxious to'go on shore," he&#xD;
said tenderly.  "I wish only to have a few&#xD;
moments talk with youbefore I leave you !"&#xD;
""You must turn' back with me instantly,&#xD;
sir," she said, alarmed by the impassioned tone&#xD;
of his voice, and by his arm' thrown suddenly&#xD;
about her waist.&#xD;
"Nay, but a short distance !"&#xD;
"Not one foot, sir. Unhand me ! What do&#xD;
you mean by this violence ? 'Shall I be' com-&#xD;
pelled, sir, to give an alarm and call'for help.?&#xD;
I assuredly will do so unless I am 'put on shore.&#xD;
instantly."'&#xD;
"Row, hard, men'!-  Do not hear her !" he&#xD;
said angrily to the oarsmen,, as they seemed to&#xD;
hesitate.&#xD;
The boat shot up the stream in the direction&#xD;
of Grasmere Grove with additionalimpetus. 'See-&#xD;
irig'this, Catharine 'sprang' from, the seat to&#xD;
which he was trying to hold her, and now really&#xD;
alarmed and the truth of his treachery towards&#xD;
her 'beginning to be too apparent to deceive her,&#xD;
&#xD;
she uttered a-loud shriek that startled the echoes&#xD;
of the shore; and strangely broke the stilliees of&#xD;
the night.&#xD;
"Help! !help,! 'help !i Save ,me, '0, save&#xD;
me !" were the words of indignant fear that.&#xD;
rang wildly through the air.&#xD;
" Nay, if you aregoing to sing thin:way, my&#xD;
birdk I shall have to:gag you," said he savagely ;&#xD;
and -by main force he' threw., around 'her his&#xD;
cloak and muffed her voice. ;I"Pull for your&#xD;
lives; men! You shall have. double pay for&#xD;
double:speed."1&#xD;
The thrilling cry for aid.had not been.uttered&#xD;
in'vain.- Edward 'who as weknew bad prowin&#xD;
ised to pay a-visit to the cottage that 'eyening4&#xD;
had justreachedthe door, whickwas open, when,&#xD;
as he 'bade the widow a good evening and was&#xD;
looking round for her daughter to welcpme him,&#xD;
the shriek from the water pierced his'ears.,&#xD;
'"What is that?" cried the widow, pale with&#xD;
alarn&#xD;
"It was like a female in. distress !  Where&#xD;
is Catharine ?" he asked, eagerly.&#xD;
" Just walked out to see the wounded young&#xD;
man's boat with him! 'Hark-! It is her voiceI&#xD;
Mercy, what has'happeried ?"'&#xD;
But before she had spoken the last words&#xD;
Edward was)bounding.through the garden, and&#xD;
leaped the wall on the side; from which, the&#xD;
shrieks came. He fled along the river shore&#xD;
like a deer, and soon came in sight of the as-.&#xD;
cending boat, which, from the quick strokes -of&#xD;
the oars'and'the rushing keel, he knew was in&#xD;
flight. He soon got near 'enough to' see that&#xD;
there were two persons in the stern evidently&#xD;
struggling with each ;other.: . He 'was  about to&#xD;
hails when Kate, releasing, her face from the&#xD;
cloak, sent forth another piercing cry for sue-&#xD;
cor.&#xD;
"0, save me ! Edward, where are you?&#xD;
Save me' from this monster! 0,ny mother"&#xD;
The voice calling thus in' despairpon his&#xD;
own name thrilled his lifer blood.., He did not&#xD;
respbnd,for fear they'might land on-the opposite&#xD;
shore with her.  But he knew it wasitheatvoice&#xD;
of {7atharine ;vandire  believed; in.the jiowor&#xD;

He was armed enly with a stout eudgel, which&#xD;
he usually walked wVith. when' out after night;&#xD;
and he had no boat ; but he recollectedthat not&#xD;
far above was an old fisherman's hut, 'where he&#xD;
would be likely to 'find a boat. 'He .glided&#xD;
swiftly along on the shore until he had got above&#xD;
the ascending barge, and, reaching the hut,-to&#xD;
histi-eat joy he'saw -the. skiff tied to the badk.,&#xD;
With his knife he -cutthe rope,:and without&#xD;
thinking ofd the odds he 'was about to encounter,'&#xD;
he launched out into the stream and came hard&#xD;
on upon the barge just as it was rounding a'&#xD;
short earte of the 'shore. :He" could see Kate&#xD;
on her, feet, having.extricated herself from the&#xD;

thn before,&#xD;
"'8top rowing and help me hold her down&#xD;

Lawrence:say, just as he came upon them,: and&#xD;
before he was seen. The two men dropped&#xD;
their oars to obey him, and rose to go aft to his&#xD;
assistance. It was at this moment, like an ar-&#xD;
row from a bow, the sharp skiff struck the side&#xD;
of the barge, and Edward,:with his:cudgel up.&#xD;
lifted, leaped on board. -With one terrible&#xD;
blow he laid the nearest oarsman in the bottom&#xD;
of the boat, while 'the other, surprised at the&#xD;
sudden onset, leaped overboard, and escaped&#xD;
the stroke which' would have laid him by 'the&#xD;
side of his dotnrade.&#xD;

"Not now, Catharine ! Are you much hurt ?"&#xD;
" No--not much-a little in -etiuggling to&#xD;

"0, yesyyelte&#xD;
"Sit down and wrap yourself in this cloak. I&#xD;

master has driven through my wrist, n your&#xD;

Atthis menace the man's restlessness ceased,&#xD;
and, taking the oars, Edward turned the boat&#xD;
about, and rowed dbwn the river. The forms of&#xD;
the two men could be seen standing on the bank&#xD;
and low mutterings were audihle.  As Edward&#xD;

But his hand and face were covered with&#xD;
blood.'&#xD;
That was easily counterfeited. I know'&#xD;
this young man's character, so well that he is&#xD;
capable of anything.  You have made a great&#xD;
escape. HoW eruld you'be so ,imprudent as to&#xD;
sail with hi?"'&#xD;
Her(3atharine acquitted herself by explain.&#xD;
ingthe manner she had been drawn on board&#xD;
after the candle had been struck out of her&#xD;
hand. She ended with pouring out the most&#xD;
fervent expressions of heartfelt gratitude to Ed-&#xD;
ward as her preserver, while she earnestly beg-&#xD;
ged him to let her take one of the oars, showing&#xD;
the deepest solicitude for his wounded wrist.'&#xD;
It is nothing, Catharine. We are nearly&#xD;
down to your house. I hear your mother's&#xD;
voice calling. She is- safe, and will, in a mo=&#xD;
meant be min your arms,"' he answered. The&#xD;
next moment they touched the shore opposite the&#xD;
cottage, and daughter and mother wept in each&#xD;
other's embrace, altlkdgh the'latter was notyet&#xD;
aware of the precise nature otthe peril in which&#xD;
her child had been placed.&#xD;
"Now, fellow, you may take your'employer's&#xD;
boat iick to hii," said Edward, stepping on&#xD;
shore and givig the barge a shov4 with hisfoot'&#xD;
out into the stream. The man got to his feet,&#xD;
and, mutterng curses loud and deep against him&#xD;
as he entered'the cottage with' the females, he-&#xD;
resuied th'e oars arid=slowly and'heavily pulled&#xD;
up the Aver;"and' soon after reached a;' }point&#xD;
where Manfed and the other oarsman, whohad';&#xD;
followed down the stream, on the watch, were !&#xD;
in waiting.&#xD;
"So, Dick, he let you bring the boat back,"&#xD;
said Manfred.&#xD;
&#xD;
attack us three from a skiff in that style," re-&#xD;
sponded the man as he pushed the nose of the&#xD;
'boat in towards the bank on whichthey. stood&#xD;
"He has given me a, knock in the side of the,&#xD;
head that wont get well in a day.' Do yue&#xD;
know who he is?"&#xD;
" An infernal innkeeper's, son," answered&#xD;
Lawrence through his clenched teeth. "I don't&#xD;
see what the fellow had to do to. be about here&#xD;
just at this time ! He shall pay for it ! Did the&#xD;
girl go into thecottage?"&#xD;
"Yes."-&#xD;
"And did he also ?"&#xD;
" He shall rue this night's work:"&#xD;
"He was wounded. He said your dirk went&#xD;
through his a'rm !"&#xD;
"I knew'it must have struck him deep, fori&#xD;
could not draw it out. Iwish it had gone through&#xD;
his heart."&#xD;
"]Better luck next time, sir," answered they&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"If I hadn't jumped overboard when I saw&#xD;
'is club coming down, I should have 4gt a&#xD;
broken head. He fought like a lion ! - I like a.&#xD;
man that, has pluck and can fight'!'&#xD;
"Do you mean any reflections upon me,' fb&#xD;
low?" fiercely: handedd Manfred, who was in&#xD;
no amiable mod just now.&#xD;
"No, indeed, sir. I don't' think you could,&#xD;
have done better than you did, sfr, he came&#xD;
down uponus 'o sudden.   I didn't se, the&#xD;
boat till it was alongside.&#xD;
"Nor did I," answered Manfred. "Our&#xD;
game is u for to night. Bub  do'not giveim&#xD;
up ,fbr aye. I will have the girl= and have his&#xD;
life. You may pull the boat up home; Dick'&#xD;
will remain here with Ket."       '    '&#xD;
theman obeyed, and soon disappeared with&#xD;
the boat;7while Ma fred, turning to'his compau.&#xD;
" We must both waylay-this Bhakloek."&#xD;
$Gladly t answered Ket. " But I hevo no'&#xD;

&#xD;
They armed themselves with heavy pieces of&#xD;
rook, and, all wet as they were, they placed&#xD;
themselves in the way which, Edward; must use&#xD;
in going away from the cottage. But'they were&#xD;
disappointed in' their purpose ; for so alarmed&#xD;
was the widow that Edward promised that he&#xD;
would remain and watch till daylight,'which he&#xD;
did, though suffering from the wound in his&#xD;
wrist; ,so atmidnight Lawrence departed with&#xD;
threats for a better time.&#xD;
We have now shown our readers the, cause of&#xD;
Manfred's hostility towards Edward, and /the&#xD;
reason of the gratitude expressed by Captain&#xD;
Wat, the brother of Catharine.  But we "will&#xD;
add a brief notice of an: interview that .took&#xD;
place the' following day between Edwar4 and&#xD;
Lawrence.   The latter, about ten o'clockin the&#xD;
morning,"was pacing up 'and down his room, ill&#xD;
at ease, and planning vengeance against Black-&#xD;
lock, and further schemes to get possession of&#xD;
the person of Kate Wynyard... A knock at his&#xD;
door drew his attention; and before he could&#xD;
say " come in;". it was opened and Edward&#xD;
Blacklook entered. He not only entered, but&#xD;
closed the door behind himself and locked it.&#xD;
The surprise of 'Lawrence at his entrance, and&#xD;
at'this act, cannot be pictured.  His first im-&#xD;
pulse of fiery rage, on beholding him, was&#xD;
checked on witnessing the cool andsdetermined&#xD;
looking of the:door. He stammered out. some&#xD;
words of surprise and resentment, but Edward,&#xD;
standing erect like a true man who fears ,io one&#xD;
in the cause of right, fixed:his, clear eye: upon&#xD;
him in a manner that a human eye had ,,never&#xD;
regarded him before, He tried to meet it and&#xD;
keep his;eye full upon his, but unable to with-&#xD;
standiits searching and majestic light, he dropped&#xD;
his own beneath them.&#xD;
"Manfred Lawrence, I have come hither to&#xD;
say icoyou but a very fewt;words.:, hey are&#xD;
these.  Your name, your liberty are bothaimy&#xD;
keeping, after last night'e work. .Now air,..I&#xD;
have no wish to deprive t you. of ither.  But&#xD;
you must, here, in this room, swear tome that&#xD;
&#xD;
you will never approach that cottage again, or&#xD;
harbor any evil designs against any one of itsw,&#xD;
helpless inmates, or I swear to you 1 will, ere&#xD;
an hour passes over your guilty head, enter a&#xD;
complaint before a magistrate in their behalf, that&#xD;
will result in your arrest iand imprisonment for&#xD;
the outrage you have committed."&#xD;
"I will not be browbeaten," answered Man-&#xD;
fred, pale as snow, while his lips trembled with,&#xD;
passion.&#xD;
"I care not what you will not be. This in.&#xD;
stant swear what I have- dictated-swear -by&#xD;
your hope of heaven and your dread- of judg-&#xD;
mentto come, that you will never harm or speak&#xD;
to either' of those,-females ttgain; but forever&#xD;
abandon all evil design against them.",,&#xD;
"And whatwill you ido if I refune to swear?&#xD;
Shootome down, 'I suppose,'" said the cowardly&#xD;
Lawrence, with a sneer.&#xD;
' No. I come not here armed with any other&#xD;
weapon, save moral force," answered Edward.&#xD;
:" Ha! Then you are in my power," he&#xD;
cried quickly, iopeaing and taking out a pistol,.&#xD;
and presenting it at Edward's breast with a wild&#xD;
leer of ,triumph.Y ou must swear now, serf !"&#xD;
Without hesitation, Edward sprang forward&#xD;
in the-face ,ofthe muzzle, and ca4ehing it by the&#xD;
barrel, he wrenched it from his grasp anddashed&#xD;
it tt the floor behind him.&#xD;
" Art thou not ,hamedk after this, to call&#xD;
thyself a gentleman ,'t    enough.   I 'can&#xD;
.have fewwords with such as thou hast proved&#xD;
thyself. Take the oath !"' This was spoken&#xD;
with authority.&#xD;
" I swear," answered Lawrence, with a hus-&#xD;
ky voice, lookingas pale as ashes.,&#xD;
* "Enough.     See that' thou break not the&#xD;
oath;" ,answered Edward, unlocking the door.&#xD;
and goingout withoutlooking behind him._&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
&#xD;
A scene of noble-heartedness. Description of the schooner, etc., and a visit on board.&#xD;
&#xD;
DWARD had no sooner heh~ra the young&#xD;
seaman speak of these large gifts to his&#xD;
mother and sister, than, heartily ashamed of&#xD;
having formed any prejudice against him, he&#xD;
grasped both of his hands warmly, and said:&#xD;
"You are a true son and brother, Captain&#xD;
Walter. 1 know your filial generosity.'&#xD;
"I am only doing my duty. I came home&#xD;
for nothing else in the world than to'bring this&#xD;
money while I had it; because' a sailor lives&#xD;
such a wandering and precarious life, if he is&#xD;
rich to-day, he may be poor to-morrow as a&#xD;
church mouse."&#xD;
"Ah, my dear boy ! Heaven willreward you&#xD;
for all this. Mr. Edward, it seems like a dream&#xD;
to me. Yet there is my boy before me, and I&#xD;
hear his voice, which I never expected to hear&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"Let Mr. Blacklock see your gold, brother&#xD;
Walter," said Catharine..&#xD;
"If he cares 'to; but I dare say he has-seen&#xD;
.more gold than this. It is a large sum to you&#xD;
and mother, Kate, but where Ihave been,&#xD;
it would not be much- thought of."&#xD;
Thus speaking, he rose and went into the in-&#xD;
ner room, and beckoned Edward to follow him.&#xD;
&#xD;
Here were two boxes of thick wood, strapped&#xD;
with iron, save the lids, which were made to.&#xD;
slide Wff. One of them the sailor removed, and&#xD;
exhibited to the amazed eyes of the young col-&#xD;
legian a larger amount of goldthan he ever&#xD;
expected to see together. He took up several&#xD;
of the pieces. They were coins of every land,&#xD;
Portuguese, English, French, Spanish, Moorish&#xD;
and Brazilian, but note American. Many of&#xD;
the pieces he admired for the beauty of he in-&#xD;
signia royal and imperial stamped upon their&#xD;
faces.&#xD;
" Your arrival was a happy day to your noth-&#xD;
er, captain," said Edward, with hearty gratifi-&#xD;
cation, as he re-entered the sitting-room, "1&#xD;
wish you joy, Mrs. Wynyard."&#xD;
"Indeed you may, sir, indeed you may;"&#xD;
she answered.&#xD;
"I will now bid you good night all," said&#xD;
Edward.&#xD;
"Do not go yet," interposed Catharine.&#xD;
"I must be at my rooms before nine."&#xD;
" I will walk on a bit with you, master," said&#xD;
the young seaman, as Edward left the door of&#xD;
that happy home.&#xD;
" Now, my good friend and shipmate," said&#xD;

Captain Walter, as they walked along through&#xD;
the garden side by side, " I want to ask youc&#xD;
one question, and I want a frank, shipshape re.&#xD;
ply."&#xD;
" You shall have it, captain," said Black-&#xD;
ock, smiling.t&#xD;
"How are you off for the larzjon?"&#xD;
"Do you mean money ?"t&#xD;
Yes. Are you poor?    Now don't take it&#xD;
aback that I'm so blunt."&#xD;
",No; I am neither poor nor rich.  My fath-&#xD;
er is in moderate circumstances, and he supports&#xD;
me. I have no wants."&#xD;
"But you are not rich."&#xD;
" Why, no."&#xD;
"That is what I thought Students must have&#xD;
money.   One of these days you'll want to lay&#xD;
- up in port three years to study law, or gospel, or&#xD;
doctoring, or some profession. You must live&#xD;
Now don't make me mad by saying no, when I&#xD;
ask you if you will take the balance of my spare&#xD;
cash."              .-&#xD;
" Indeed, captain, you-"&#xD;
"Wait till I tell you how much it is, before&#xD;
you begin to refuse. I brought with me fifteen&#xD;
-thoisand dollars. Ten of it I have given to&#xD;
my mother and sister, all to be banked regular-&#xD;

left. Now I shall want about twelve hundred&#xD;
to make some purchases of provisions is Bos-&#xD;
ton, for my schooner, and the balance is yours."&#xD;
jMine?  0, no, captain."&#xD;
"Don't make me angry, master Edward. I'll&#xD;
do .as I please.  You have done .me and mine'&#xD;
a service that money don't 'begin to. pay for.&#xD;
But then, I can make you a present if I choose,&#xD;
and I can do what I will with my own. That&#xD;
money, I have made up my mind, -shail be&#xD;
yours So you need not say one word."&#xD;
" I will say two words, though, my worthy&#xD;
Captain Walter, and they are 'no, sir,' " he&#xD;
continued firmly.  "I must offend you if you&#xD;
will get offended, but I cannot acceptthismon-&#xD;
ey.  ly parents supply me with all I need.-&#xD;
ay, you must take my refusal kindly."&#xD;
'-"Well, have your own way.. Proud as Lu-&#xD;
gisr ycu young students are."&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, it is not pride, and yet it is. But I&#xD;
cannot consent to take this money from you.-&#xD;
You will need it. Go place it in the bank for&#xD;
yourself some rainy day"&#xD;
"4o, no ! if you wont take it, I will give it&#xD;
to Kate."&#xD;
" That will be right. It is just for a sister&#xD;
to share a brother's earnings-but-"&#xD;
"Earnings ! well-so they are, I suppose,&#xD;
for I have done enough for the gold," he mut-&#xD;
tered in tones not perfectly audible to Ed ward.&#xD;
" Well, I don't think any the worse for your&#xD;
refusing. I like your independence. Now let&#xD;
me tell you, if we shouldn't see each other&#xD;
again, that if you are ever in trouble, and Wat&#xD;
Wynyard can help you, call on him. He's&#xD;
your man-"&#xD;
"Thanks, my brave friend. But I trust I&#xD;
shall never be so straitened as to have to&#xD;
prove your sincerity."&#xD;
"There's no knowing. But how would you&#xD;
like to ,take a row to-morrow evening fiofm the&#xD;
cottage, with mother, and Kate, and myself,&#xD;
down to my schooner ?"&#xD;
"Where does she lay?"&#xD;
In the river, just above the mouth, in the&#xD;
first bend 1My men are taking in fresh water&#xD;
and fresh grub, there. Though I say it, you&#xD;
will see as pretty a bit of a salt Water craft, as&#xD;
ever floated."&#xD;
- " I will come down to the cottage. At what&#xD;
hour?"&#xD;
" At four bells."&#xD;
"That is what o'clock ?"&#xD;
" Two.".&#xD;
"It is too early for me to leave the univ -&#xD;
sity."&#xD;
" Say four, then."&#xD;
"I will be there at that hour to go with you."&#xD;
"That is hearty. I shall expect you."&#xD;
With these words he shook. Edward by the&#xD;
hand, and parted from him returning towards&#xD;
the cottage. The former walked briskly for-&#xD;
ward towards the university, reflecting upon the&#xD;
xtraordinary offer made to him by the young&#xD;
seaman, and wondering in what manner he had&#xD;
acquired so much wealth in gold, in seven&#xD;
&#xD;
years' absence, and at the generosity which&#xD;
could bestow the whole at once, upon his moth-&#xD;
er and sister, and upon one, which he might&#xD;
not, after leaving Thursday, which was the day&#xD;
he was to sail, ever see again.&#xD;
These sailors are queer fellows," he said,&#xD;
as he reached the stile which led into the college&#xD;
campus, " and if they get their money easily,&#xD;
it goes easily. He seems to have a dash of&#xD;
bold sincerity about him, that belongs to his&#xD;
class, but with all, there is in his face a look 1&#xD;
do not like. He seems to shun a clear, open&#xD;
gaze, as if he had secrets he was afraid could&#xD;
be 'read in his eyes by observers. But perhaps&#xD;
I am doing him injustice, and thinking unchar-&#xD;
itably of one who would have shared liberally,&#xD;
with me. For Catharine's sake, and that of&#xD;
her mother, I rejoice.  They will now be com-&#xD;
fortable for life."  His thoughts of Catharine'&#xD;
now reverted to Isabel Lawrence, and with a&#xD;
quicker throbbing of the heart, he entered his&#xD;
room.&#xD;
The succeeding afternoon about half past&#xD;
five o'clock, a young man in a blue jacket and&#xD;
Spanish hat, which broadly shaded his eyes,&#xD;
was standing, with a glass at his eye, on the&#xD;
quarter-deck of a neat, clipper-built schooner,&#xD;
topsail rigged, which was riding at anchor, near&#xD;
the entrance of Charles river, about three hun-&#xD;
dred .yards south of Lechmere Point. The&#xD;
vessel was about one hundred and seventy tons&#xD;
burden, and lay exceedingly low in the water,&#xD;
so'much so, that it was easy to step from  her&#xD;
gangway into a boat alongside, without descend-&#xD;
ing but two steps. The schooner was a model&#xD;
of symmetry and nautical beauty. Her masts&#xD;
were long and whip-like, and raked far over her&#xD;
stern, giving her a"wicked, piratical air that' ex-,&#xD;
cited no little curiosity among those who ob-&#xD;
served her, to know what she was, and what her&#xD;
business was there. Even the curiosity extend-&#xD;
ed to the revenue vessel commanded by the&#xD;
veteran Sturgis, who sent a boat round from&#xD;
Boston harbor to spy and report. Bat nothing;&#xD;
could be discovered to authorize capture, for her&#xD;
papers were all regular, showing, as her con-.&#xD;
mander stated, that she was a Portuguese yes-&#xD;
&#xD;
I -&#xD;
&#xD;
sel, who was waiting there to receive on board a&#xD;
bearer of despatches from the Portuguese nit-&#xD;
ister at Washington, to his government ; and&#xD;
that she ha"d chosen that birth only for the&#xD;
convenience of taking on board fresh water.-&#xD;
The vessel being moreover armed with four&#xD;
twelve pounders, gave good cause for inquiry&#xD;
and curiosity. But as the revenue officer who&#xD;
boarded her, pronounced her "all right and&#xD;
ship-shape," of course she ceased to be an ob'&#xD;
ject of suspicion, while she continued, as all&#xD;
foreign vessels do, to remain an object of curi-&#xD;
ous interest. On the day in question, when we&#xD;
introduce to the reader her lieutenant in corm-&#xD;
mand, watching the upper waters of the river&#xD;
through his spy-glass, many country folks were&#xD;
on the shore gazing at her, and remarking upon&#xD;
the red and yellow caps of the men who walked&#xD;
about her decks; and several boats, some laden&#xD;
coming down the river, and others ascending&#xD;
light, laid on their oars to watch her, and com-&#xD;
ment upon her beauty and outlandish air.&#xD;
About a dozen men altogether could be seen&#xD;
on her decks, working about them, -patching can-&#xD;
vass, reeving rigging into blocks, and busying&#xD;
themselves in the hundred and one petty duties&#xD;
always to be done aboard a vessel just in from&#xD;
sea, or soon about to sail. Some of the crew&#xD;
during the day had pulled ashore several times&#xD;
with their water casks, to fill them at a spring&#xD;
not far from a farm house, when, though they&#xD;
behaved very civilly, the good farm-folks watch-&#xD;
ed them at a safe distance. But one or two&#xD;
young men who approached them nearer, said&#xD;
they wePe all dark, swarthy men, and spoke in&#xD;
an unknown lingo, save one with a terrific&#xD;
beard, who made a wretched attempt to make&#xD;
himself understood by them, in a language&#xD;
which gave one broken English word, for every&#xD;

At the time we present our readers on board&#xD;
this vessel, the duties of supplying her with&#xD;
fresh water and fresh provisions were over;&#xD;
and with her boat called aboard, and hanging&#xD;
from the quarter and stern davits, for she had&#xD;
three boats, she lIty as if waiting for some per-&#xD;

pected from above the river was very evident,&#xD;
by the earnest gaze which this young officer&#xD;
scanned that direction from the vessel. While&#xD;
he has his glass at his eye, we will describe his&#xD;
appearance.&#xD;
He was slightly made, but rather tall, dress-&#xD;
ed,, as we have said, in blue jacket and trowsers,&#xD;
with a Spanish sombrero shading his face. He&#xD;
was not of the country of the dark-looking men&#xD;
on board; ,for his complexion was fair, his&#xD;
cheeks ruddy, through the slight tan upon them,&#xD;
his hair very light, long and flowing, like flax,&#xD;
- his eyes as blue as the sea which was his home.&#xD;
His age was not above twentyone, for he had&#xD;
no sign of beard or moustache.  The expression&#xD;
of his countenance was remarkably resolute, and&#xD;
his face would have been eminently handsome,&#xD;
but for a scar that crossed his left cheek.  He&#xD;
had a daring expression to his face, as if he&#xD;
were ready to venture his life any moment, and&#xD;
would enjoy himself most when the excitement&#xD;
of danger ran highest.&#xD;
Not many feet from him   was seated on the&#xD;
arm-chest, a man of very different appearance.&#xD;
Be was very short, very fat and large, and had&#xD;
an enormous double chin, beneath which grew&#xD;
a reddish white goat's beard, long and peaked.&#xD;
His, face was round as the moon, and his fore&#xD;
head, wide and low, projecting over a pair of&#xD;
shall, straight eye-brows, beneath which danced&#xD;
a pair of small gray eyes, full of merry light,&#xD;
yet the expression of his thick lips showed that&#xD;
lMke all other men of human mould, he could b&#xD;
ulIen andhard-headedon suitable and sufficien&#xD;
opepions; nevertheless, the ,permanent expres&#xD;
siopi of his face was mirthful., He was dresse&#xD;
in aglinen jacket, that scarcely compassed on&#xD;
hald of his capacious abdompn ; wore a pint&#xD;
shirt with a pink ruffle, and a huge came&#xD;
breast-pin, on which was represented Dan Cupi&#xD;
irth his bow at his ear, aiming an arrow dea&#xD;
aghe .wearer's heart.  About his neck was&#xD;
heavy thain of Guinea gold, and appended i&#xD;
its vario  ,charms such as thesacred beanc&#xD;
Oqngola, ,the blood stone which.brings goo&#xD;
luek, little silver ,moon forfair, winos; and&#xD;
pross for -universal protection, with a little e&#xD;
&#xD;
ony heathen god or two. The fat fingers of&#xD;
this gentleman's left hand were adorned with&#xD;
rings as heavy as sovereigns. He wore white&#xD;
duck pants, and- green morocco  shoes with&#xD;
buckles. Altogether, .he was a very respecta-&#xD;
ble and queer looking individual in his way.-&#xD;
He was at the present time engaged in smoking&#xD;
a cigar, and in looking across the Back Bay at&#xD;
Boston, with its spires, domes and thousand&#xD;
roofs, as if he admired the view, which has few&#xD;
equals in the American Union.   -&#xD;
"The captain is coming," suddenly said the&#xD;
young lieutenant.&#xD;
"I am glad of it," responded the gentleman&#xD;
with the talismans about his neck, breaking his&#xD;
reverie to turn and look up the river, "we shall&#xD;
'now know when we are to get out o' these wa-&#xD;
ters. I don't think it will be over safe for us&#xD;
to lay here long."&#xD;
"And pray why not, major ?" said the young&#xD;
man, still looking throughhis glass, "stand by&#xD;
at the gangway to receive the captain," he gave&#xD;
orders, "he has two women in the boat, and a&#xD;
shore gentlemaai."&#xD;
" Vomen ?" echoed Major Dyrfel, for such&#xD;
was his name and title, nautical man as he was,&#xD;
"I must spruce myself up    You dark ball,&#xD;
bring me my looking-glass and comb.  Vomen?&#xD;
f The captain is a lucky man!"&#xD;
The personage addressed as "dark ball,"&#xD;
was a native African lad, who was formed far&#xD;
more like an ourang outang than a man. He&#xD;
e was about sixteen years old, with flexible joints&#xD;
t and flexible muscles, so that it would seem to&#xD;
- be the easiest thing in the world for him to tie&#xD;
d himself into a knot like . a pair of stockings.&#xD;
e His face was hideously, black, and with a mon-&#xD;
k strous mouth, flat nose, and narrow, Chinese&#xD;
o looking eyes, he was by no means the most pre-&#xD;
d possessing young gentleman it. has been our&#xD;

a suit of scarlet flannel from head to foot,nand his&#xD;

and brought him a three cornered fragment of a&#xD;
looking-glass, and a comb which had but -five&#xD;
and a half of its original score of teeth remain-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"Dee dar, mashoo," he said, speaking from&#xD;
his throat in a tone as if it was filled with pud-&#xD;
ding.&#xD;
'Hold up the glass, black, so ; now let me&#xD;
see how I look to receive the ladies. Bless me,&#xD;
it's a werry long time since I have seen a shore&#xD;
lady !"&#xD;
"If you haven't seen shore ladies, major,"&#xD;
said the lieutenant, smiling, "pray what other&#xD;
ladies would you be likely to see. Old women&#xD;
don't ship before the mast, yet, nor young wo-&#xD;
men-for royal boys." -&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mermaids, lad, mermaids is sea-ladies."&#xD;
"Schooner ahoy !" came sharp and clear&#xD;
from a boat on the water.&#xD;
" Ahoy !" responded the lieutenant, with&#xD;
alacrity.                              .&#xD;
The second lieutenant Derfyl sprung-to his&#xD;
feet without completing his sentence, and has-&#xD;
tened to look over the quarter railing into the&#xD;
boat, while the other proceeded to the gangway&#xD;
to receive it.-&#xD;
The party was soon on board.  Captain Wat&#xD;
presented his first lieutenant as Kirk Cresswell&#xD;
to his mother and sister, and his second as the&#xD;
"major."   The latter bowed to the mother with&#xD;
his eyes on the : daughter, and then whispered&#xD;
aside to the lieutenant :&#xD;
" Almost as handsome as a mermaid-if she&#xD;
only had green hair."&#xD;
" I wouldn't give a glance of her{ living eye&#xD;
for all the -mermaids in ths sea,- that one can't&#xD;
see till he is drowned."&#xD;
Captain Wat, after showing his vessel to his&#xD;
mother and sister, and explaining many;things&#xD;
to Edward, who was half in love with, a tea-&#xD;
man's life at what he saw,,took them down jntp&#xD;
his cabin.  It was, to be sure, -a small one,.but&#xD;
neat,- and fitted up with some . pretensions to ex&#xD;
nament.- Here he;placed before gem figs, 4ates&#xD;
and raisins, all ,of which -he said he had seen&#xD;
growing on trees and vinesin foreign lands;&#xD;
and he did not forget to bring forth from his&#xD;
stores a bottle of rich wine.&#xD;

" And this is your vessel, my son," said the&#xD;
happy widow, looking around her.&#xD;
" Yes, mother."&#xD;
"And why do you carry .those large guns,&#xD;
brother ?' asked his sister, who seemed as per-&#xD;
fectly hap  as her mother, though a shade of&#xD;
some unpleasant, inward, secret feeling was&#xD;
perceptible to Edward's more watchful eyes on&#xD;
the young captain's face. It rather dwelt abid-&#xD;
ingly in the eyes' depths, than showed itself on&#xD;
the surface. It was visible behind all his&#xD;
smiles ; and Edward could not help saying to&#xD;
himself, "he is-either a very unhappy, or per.&#xD;
haps a guilty man."&#xD;
At length, the visit was over; and as it grew&#xD;
dark, Captain Wat prepared to return up the&#xD;
river by moonlight. Edward left the schooner&#xD;
almost fascinated with the life of a wanderer on&#xD;
the ocean, and half of a mind to yield to old&#xD;
Davy Blacklock's wishes, and enter the navy&#xD;
if he could obtain a berth therein. This he ex-&#xD;
pressed to the captain as they rowed up the riv&#xD;
er, while Kate put in her objections at once, and&#xD;
said that the sea would never suit him, "she&#xD;
knew."&#xD;
"You shall have free passage with me, Mas-&#xD;
ter Blacklock, if you wish to go,".said Captain&#xD;
Wat.&#xD;
I am  half a mind to take you at your&#xD;
word."&#xD;
"0, no, Edward--no I" exclaimed Kate.&#xD;
"But where are you to sail from here,?"&#xD;
" Where ?. First to-to Portugal I I did not&#xD;
tell you' that we were waiting here for despatch-&#xD;
es from Washington, to take them to Portugal."&#xD;
" Ye, you did. Do you sail for Lisbon ?"&#xD;
" Direct. After that, we shall take a run&#xD;
down the African coast, to Mogadore."&#xD;
"I envy your privilege. to go thus about the&#xD;
world," raid Edward, and if I were free frqmn&#xD;
the university to-morrow, I should be terrppted&#xD;
to take at least one cruise with you."&#xD;
Little did he suspect how soon be, ibld he&#xD;
made free by his destiny to yield to his wish to&#xD;
roam.&#xD;
They soopi handed at, the cottage,. and. Ed.&#xD;
ward, parting from them, sought once more th9&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
Infuence of his visit on the young student. , Manfred Lawrence again. Encounter with&#xD;
Wynyard. Sad' intelligence. A phase of   Kate's heart. A  death scene.  Sympathy&#xD;
of Isabel. A   deeply interesting conversation.&#xD;
&#xD;
T    HE visit which Edward had made to the&#xD;
warlike and beautiful clipper schooner,&#xD;
the free and independent mode of life which&#xD;
one who commanded a craft like that must lead,&#xD;
the liberty to visit whatsoever sea or land the&#xD;
henrt wished, were ideas that took a fast hold&#xD;
upon his mind after his return to the college.&#xD;
they were inflamed by an interesting recital of&#xD;
his adventures, which, (n the next day, the&#xD;
captain, who called to his rooms to see him,&#xD;
gave of his adventures in foreign lands.'&#xD;
But," said he, " but, captain, in what ca-&#xD;
pacity could I sail with you, if I should get&#xD;
myself into the mind ?" He said this smiling-&#xD;
ly, for he had no idea of leaving college, a few&#xD;
months in which would complete his course ;&#xD;
though at the close of his collegiate course he&#xD;
began to think he should turn his face towards a&#xD;
nautical career.&#xD;
"You may go as passenger."&#xD;
" Thai would be an idle life ; and besides I&#xD;
have not the fortune to play the gentleman&#xD;
sailor, nor indeed have I the inclination; my&#xD;
mind is of to6 active a turn for that."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I will makeyou my third lieutenant, and&#xD;
give you pay accordingly; and one of these&#xD;
days, when you learn to sail a vessel, you can&#xD;
easily get command of one."&#xD;
" Yes. I should like the command, I dare&#xD;
say, much better than climbing the ladder&#xD;
to it."&#xD;
" A couple of voyages would make a good&#xD;
seaman of you."&#xD;
" So soon. Ah, Captain    Wynyard, you&#xD;
tempt me. But there is one question I have&#xD;
not asked you.  ln what trade do you sail, usu-&#xD;
ally ? You are not always coming after bear-&#xD;
ers of despatches ?"I&#xD;
"No, that is true.- I follow the best fortune&#xD;
that offers. Sailors sail the world round in&#xD;
search of fortunes. Should I have an offer, on&#xD;
reaching Portugal, to take a message to Brazil&#xD;
for rich pay, I should accept it. I follow the&#xD;
curent of fortune. We seamen are as ineon-&#xD;
staat as the winds. Who' is that young man&#xD;
crossing the green ?" asked the captain, who&#xD;
was seated at the window in Edward's room.&#xD;
&#xD;
KATE WYNYARD.               46&#xD;
&#xD;
"That is Manfred Lawrence "&#xD;
The captain's eye flashed fire. His brow&#xD;
colored ; and springing to his feet, he was rush-&#xD;
ing from the room, when Ed ward placed himself&#xD;
between him and the door.&#xD;
" Do nothing rash, my dear captain. Re-&#xD;
member your promise made to me."&#xD;
"True,"' answered the captain.  "But I.&#xD;
would give my right eye to meet that man on&#xD;
the open sea. What a haughty port. I like,&#xD;
him not."&#xD;
"Nevertheless, do not avenge yourself upon&#xD;
him for the act he has already been punished&#xD;
for by me. It will' only bring your innocent&#xD;
sister's name up unpleasantly before the public&#xD;
eye. "&#xD;
" Well, for your sake, I will let it drop at&#xD;
present."&#xD;
"And forever, I trust "&#xD;
"That may be as we chance to cross each&#xD;
other's paths," answered Wat Wynyard, reseat-&#xD;
ing himself; but he soon after rose and said he&#xD;
would go down to the cottage to tell his mother&#xD;
he had placed the money in the bank all ship-&#xD;
shape, and they could draw for it all, or part,&#xD;
or only the interest, just as they pleased.&#xD;
"I will accompany you," said Edward, who&#xD;
feared his sudden departure had connection with&#xD;
his recent view of Lawrence, and that he would&#xD;
seek to cross his path.&#xD;
"Very well--come."&#xD;
So Edward proceeded with him towards the&#xD;
cottage ; and half way there they met Lawrence,'&#xD;
face to face, crossing the road by a path that&#xD;
led towards a by-street of the town. He passed&#xD;
them with a scowl of fierce hatred upon Edward,&#xD;
and a look of keen curiosity at his companion.&#xD;
This scrutiny roused the tiger in Wynyard's&#xD;
breast, and he drew up before him and said, in&#xD;
a tone as high and bold as a man could use :&#xD;
"You seem to wish to know whoI am by the,&#xD;
out of your eye. I will tell you. I am Wat,&#xD;
Wynyard, the brother of the maiden you had&#xD;
the insolence to give your thoughts to. *Stop,&#xD;
sir iIf you pass on beforeI tell you what you&#xD;
are, I will pistol you I" and the captain present-&#xD;
ed a pistol at his breast. Lawrence stepped&#xD;
&#xD;
back and turned as pale as death. Edward&#xD;
sprang forward and laid his hand upon the&#xD;
muzzle.&#xD;
"Captain, what did you promise me 2"&#xD;
"Promises are idle words with my foe before&#xD;
my eyes," answered the captain ; releasing the&#xD;
pistol from his grasp. " I will not harm him if&#xD;
he stands and hears me. But by all that is&#xD;
above I will shoot him through the heart if he&#xD;
budges one inch."&#xD;
" This is your cowardly work, Blacklock,"&#xD;
said Lawrence, pale with fear and rage. "You&#xD;
have told him of this, when you swore you&#xD;
would keep it a secret."&#xD;
" It is false, craven I" cried Wynyard. " He&#xD;
has never breathed it to me. On the contrary,&#xD;
he has kept me from doing you the harm my&#xD;
duty and honor as a brother tells me I owe you.&#xD;
Stand there-! Now, do you not think you ought&#xD;
to be ashamed of yourself, to creep into a widow's&#xD;
house and rob her of her only daughter ? and&#xD;
seek to rob that daughter of her honor?-...man&#xD;
-beast--worse than murderer?  Thou wouldst&#xD;
have brought the widow's gray hairs down to&#xD;
the grave with sorrow and shame, and covered&#xD;
the daughter with irreparable infamy and degra-&#xD;
dation ! Yes, you, you, would have done this,&#xD;
and meditated to do this, but for the courage of&#xD;
this noble young man, in comparison with whom&#xD;
you are as a black devil compared with an angel&#xD;
of light. Go !  I have done with theeI Go,&#xD;
toad, serpent, brute ! Go, and remember that&#xD;
innocence will always have its avengers !"&#xD;
He put up his pistol, and Lawrence, almost-&#xD;
livid with rage and terror, walked rapidly oh&#xD;
his way, his mortification deepened not only by&#xD;
seeing this public disgrace witnessed by Edward,&#xD;
but by some four or five persons who chanced&#xD;
to be on the roa4 and near at the time.&#xD;
"I am sorry you have done this thing, Cap.&#xD;
tain Wynyard," said Edward, as they walked&#xD;
on together.&#xD;
"I could not help giving him a few words of&#xD;
my mind. I feel better now. I shan't trouble&#xD;
him again, you rhay depend upon that."&#xD;
Edward was about to express his hope that it&#xD;
would end here, when one of the stable boys of&#xD;

the Brown Bear came galloping up the road, within her own. She felt he regarded her only&#xD;
mounted on a plough horse without a saddle. as a friend-no more ; while she was suffering&#xD;
When he saw Edward, he commenced calling the happiness of her love to be bound up in&#xD;

"Do they think he will die ?" asked Captains died.&#xD;
&#xD;
Wat.&#xD;
"They says it ; but there's no knowin' till he&#xD;
be dead," answered the clownish youth, with an&#xD;
oracular look.&#xD;
"I am  sorry for him  and for this young&#xD;
man," said the captain, leaving the lad and&#xD;
walking thoughtfully home. When he commu-&#xD;
nicated the fact to his mother and sister, they&#xD;
expressed the deepest sympathy and regret.&#xD;
"He is a fine man, and it would be e great&#xD;
loss to Mr. Edward to lose him."&#xD;
&#xD;
When Edward reached " The Brown Bear,"&#xD;
he threw himself from his horse, and rushed&#xD;
into the house. Within the door Dame Black-&#xD;
lock met him. He saw by her face that David&#xD;
still lived, but could not long last. She silently&#xD;
pressed his hand, while she covered her eyes&#xD;
and wept.&#xD;
"How is he, mother ?" he asked, tenderly&#xD;
and softly.&#xD;
"Worse every minute."&#xD;
&#xD;
As for Catharine, she walked out into her   -Have you sent for the doctor ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
" Bless you, bless you !  You have come atI&#xD;

"I m grieved at the heart, my dear father,1&#xD;
to see you thus," he said, kneeling by his pil-&#xD;
low, and weeping upon the hand he held. " I&#xD;
hastened without delay as soon as the sad news&#xD;
reached me."&#xD;
" I know it, Eddy. You always loved me&#xD;
as if I had been your own father."&#xD;
" I forget that you are not. I 1 know no other&#xD;
father than you, who have faithfully done a&#xD;
father's part to me ; and no other mother, than&#xD;
my dear mother,-and here he clasped her hand&#xD;
also in his, and kissed it reverently,-who has&#xD;
always loved me as a son."&#xD;
"I know no difference, my boy," answered&#xD;
the dame, with her eyes raining tears which&#xD;
she did not think of wiping away, but let them&#xD;
run like raindrops from her eyes.&#xD;
" Let me say a word to you, Edward," said&#xD;
David, "before my voice fails me.  You know&#xD;
you are not our son. You know how we found&#xD;
you. Perhaps one day your father may turn&#xD;
up.  I don't know, 'however.  It may be and&#xD;
it may not be.  If you should ever find meet&#xD;
parents, I need not tell you that your love to&#xD;
them is due, though it looks as if they deserted&#xD;

you were taken from them by those who desert-&#xD;

"And what is the name, my dear father ?"&#xD;
asked Edward, eagerly, emotions unknown to,&#xD;
him before :agitating his-soul.&#xD;
"It is-buti-it has escaped me.. But you&#xD;

He pressed the hands of his wife and of Ed-&#xD;
ward, and held them for an hour, when he&#xD;
breathed out his life ; and the spirit departing&#xD;
left a pleasant look impressed upon the mouth.&#xD;
We draw a veil over this scene of grief and&#xD;
of death.&#xD;
The evening of the funeral of the publican,&#xD;
Edward walked from the graveyard, where he&#xD;
had lingered long after the cortege had retired.&#xD;
Sadly and slowly he moved along the road which&#xD;
passed around the estate of General Lawrence.&#xD;
He was full of sorrow. He felt that he had&#xD;
lost his best, his only friend, save, indeed, Dame&#xD;
Blacklock, who solely now remained to him.&#xD;
The day was drawing to a close, and as the&#xD;
sun went down, and the moon rose and found&#xD;
him seated on the steps of the old church, with&#xD;
his face buried in his hands, the very personifi-&#xD;
cation of sorrow. But he is not long left alone&#xD;
in this up-giving of himself to grief. From her&#xD;
window, Isabel Lawrence had seen him pass&#xD;
along the road, and though it was twilight, she&#xD;
recognized him, and her whole soul sympathized&#xD;
with him; for she knew of his heavy loss, and&#xD;
that he must now be returning from the church-&#xD;
yard, desolate and mourning over his loss. She&#xD;
left her room, and gliding from the house, cross-&#xD;
ed the lawn to a side gate which opened upon&#xD;
the road, to speak to him and offer him those&#xD;
words of sympathy which her heart prompted.&#xD;
But he had gone so far that she could not reach&#xD;
him without running. She, however, knew that&#xD;
at the foot of the grounds near the river-side,&#xD;
the road would by a bend bring him near the&#xD;
wall of the lawn, when she could speak to him&#xD;
and detain him. So she hastened along the&#xD;
gravelled walk for two hundred yards, and when&#xD;
it terminated, she took her way across the ver-&#xD;
dant sward and soon reached the foot of the&#xD;
bluff on which the church stood. Here she&#xD;
saw him moving round the ruins, having quitted&#xD;
the road to seek the seclusion of the sacred spot&#xD;
so congenial to;his present feelings.&#xD;
At first she hesitated to advance,; but co.&#xD;
scious of the rectitude and benevolence of her&#xD;
motives, she ascended the slight eminence and&#xD;
reached the ruin upon which the moon, now at&#xD;
&#xD;

4er full, was pouring its rosy beams with touch-&#xD;
ing beauty.  She saw him seated upon the stepsI&#xD;
facing the east, and without hesitation, with the&#xD;
fearlessness of innocence and truth, she ap-&#xD;
proached him and lightly laid her hand upon&#xD;
his shoulder, breathing at the same time his&#xD;
name.&#xD;
"Edward !"&#xD;
He raised his face, and the moonbeams glis-&#xD;
tened upon tears.&#xD;
" Miss Lawrence !"&#xD;
" Yes, Edward. I saw you come hither, and&#xD;
your sadness and grief touched me so, that I&#xD;
have come to say a word or two of kindness,&#xD;
and to assure you that I sympathize with you&#xD;
with all my heart !"&#xD;
"Thanks, Isabel !" he said, at that hour of&#xD;
sorrow forgetting the formal style of a title,&#xD;
which also would have placed between them the&#xD;
barrier which her frankness had overpowered.&#xD;
" I knew you would not be indifferent to my&#xD;
loss.  You are very kind. But do not remain&#xD;
here,'I beseech you. The night is damp, and&#xD;
I fear that your brother would hardly forgive&#xD;
you if he knew you were here."&#xD;
"My brother ! I do not let his prejudices-&#xD;
influence me, Edward," she said, smiling, but&#xD;
firmly and with proper spirit. " How have you&#xD;
learned anything ?"&#xD;
"His conversation with you after I left you&#xD;
last Sunday evening, was overheard in part by&#xD;
a servant of the inn, and was repeated to me.&#xD;
Therefore, I pray you, do notincur his displeas-&#xD;
ure a second time."&#xD;
"Do you command me to go away ?" she&#xD;
said, reproachfully, looking earnestly into his&#xD;
still tear-wet eyes.&#xD;
"Command you? I? 0, never, Isabel !&#xD;
Your presence is like that of an angel ! Al-&#xD;
ready my grief is lightened to feel that you&#xD;
sympathize with me !"&#xD;
"Then I will remain a little while. I do&#xD;
not fear Manfred. He loves me too well to be&#xD;
long angry with me. I am sorry he dislikes&#xD;
you, as he evidently does, and as yen must&#xD;
know. You can never have done him wrong."&#xD;
&#xD;
YN YAI D.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I wish no evil to him, nor would I do him&#xD;
harm ; but on the contrary, serve him."&#xD;
"I have been thinking a good deal of our&#xD;
last interview," she said, as if she would e range&#xD;
the theme; "and it has called up all the past&#xD;
with great vividness."&#xD;
"And with me also, Isabel, if I may call&#xD;
you by your girlish name; since I left you, I&#xD;
have lived in memory all my boyish days, and&#xD;
again roamed the woodland, sailed, beach nut-&#xD;
ted, berried and bird's-nested with you. Those,&#xD;
indeed, were happy, happy days ! But they&#xD;
are now passed, Isabel ! Years have ma'e us&#xD;
comparatively strangers, and we can never be&#xD;
as intimate as then !"&#xD;
"And why not, Edward ?" she said, be-&#xD;
witehingly.&#xD;
"My position and yours I now better under-&#xD;
stand, Miss Lawrence.  The forms of life have&#xD;
ploughed a gulf between us that friendship even&#xD;
dare not overstep. You move in a sphere I,&#xD;
cannot venture to hope to penetrate with my&#xD;
humble origin."&#xD;
" Edward, I wish to ask you one question."&#xD;
"Two, if you please, "dear Isabel," he said,;&#xD;
hardly conscious, the endearing epithet flowed&#xD;
out from his heart so naturally to his lips, that&#xD;
he uttered it.&#xD;
She blushed at ,the epithet, but not with an-&#xD;
ger, for it fell sweetly upon her ears and filled,&#xD;
her heart with joyful hope.&#xD;
"Do you really like me as well as you did&#xD;
when we were children.-when I gave you the&#xD;
ring and you made the cage for me ?"  Here&#xD;
a delightful smile played about h'er mouth.&#xD;
" Do I ?  Far, far better ! I have never&#xD;
forgotten you; and during all your absence, I&#xD;
have daringly thought of you, and as the time&#xD;
drew near when you were expected home, I&#xD;
counted the days. Like you? Ah, Isabel, if&#xD;
I dared I would call the sentiment I feel tow-&#xD;
ards you by a tenderer word.  Shall I utter it ?&#xD;
Will you forgive my boldness if I offend, though&#xD;
I would rather die than offend you?"&#xD;
"Speak, I will not be offended," she said,&#xD;
softly, dropping her eyes, while she withdrew&#xD;
not the trembling hand he held within his.&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
The happy interview. Its sudden interruption. A precious brace of scoundrels. A second&#xD;
plan of abduction. Manfred's cowardly and hostile act.&#xD;
&#xD;
T these words of undisguised truth and&#xD;
deep feeling, which none but a true and&#xD;
pure-hearted girl could have spoken, in such a&#xD;
frank and ingenuous,and wholly unaffected man-&#xD;
ner, Edward drew her towards himself gently,&#xD;
and imprinted the first kiss of love and confidence&#xD;
upon her brow. She did not withdraw from the&#xD;
enfolding circle of his arm, and, for a moment,&#xD;
both were silent, their happiness too great for&#xD;
-language to express.&#xD;
At length Edward broke the sweet silence, by&#xD;
saying, in a tone tinged with regretfulness:&#xD;
" Dear Isabel, I feel that I do wrong, thus to&#xD;
win and hold your young heart. You know&#xD;
nothing of the world.  You love me now, but&#xD;
if you were one day to link your fate with mine,&#xD;
I feel you would grieve and sink under the&#xD;
pointed finger of contempt, which would greet&#xD;
you as-I use the word frankly-the wife of&#xD;
Edward Blacklock.    For your sake, though it&#xD;
would cast a gloom over my whole days-for&#xD;
your sake, your happiness and peace, this inter-&#xD;
view, this happy, blissful interview should be&#xD;
our last. When you have seen more of the&#xD;
world-for recollect you are just from school--&#xD;
you will perceive the error your regard for me&#xD;
has tempted you to commit, and be thankful,&#xD;
and, perhaps, to me, grateful that my calmer ex-&#xD;
&#xD;
perience prevented it. Your brother will be the&#xD;
first to cast you from his heart ; your mother's&#xD;
displeasure will hang over you; the friends,&#xD;
who now so much love and-respect you, will treat&#xD;
you coldly, and for my sake you will thus wed&#xD;
yourself to a life of unhappiness and degrada-&#xD;
tion.''&#xD;
"Have you said all?" she asked, with tears&#xD;
sparkling in the moonbeams, as she fixed her&#xD;
eyes reproachfully upon his face, while the inde-&#xD;
pendence of her spirit flashed from them.&#xD;
"I have said what I have said, Isabel, as if&#xD;
I were pronouncing my own doom."&#xD;
" Hear me ! After what I have said, I need&#xD;
not repeat to you that I love you with all my&#xD;
heart and being. With you I would dwell in&#xD;
poverty, rather than in splendor with another,&#xD;
whom I could never love.  No, Edward ! Do&#xD;
not seek to renounce me from thy side ! By it&#xD;
I could smile at the world's pity,, and be indif-&#xD;
ferent to its scorn. Unless you wish to implant&#xD;
irrevocably in my mind the dread idea that you&#xD;
wish to sever forever our present bond of the&#xD;
union of our hearts, let my ears no more. be&#xD;
pained by hearing them. They but prove to me&#xD;
what needed no proof to mue, the lofty and&#xD;
manly sense of honor and generous spirit which&#xD;
has always characterized you. No, no ! - You&#xD;
&#xD;
KATE WYNYARD.               51&#xD;
&#xD;
shall neither lose your happiness nor I mine, for&#xD;
the world. What is the world to me, without thy&#xD;
love ? - With Gertrude of Von Derwerte, I re-&#xD;
peat,&#xD;
" The world ! what means it? Mine is here !"&#xD;
"Thou dreamest, Isabel," said Edward, his&#xD;
fine face animated with all the happiness the&#xD;
proudly confessed love of such a noble girl&#xD;
should kindle in any true soul. " Then let this&#xD;
subject be dropped forever.  From  this day I&#xD;
will try to make myself worthy of your love, so&#xD;
that in giving me your heart you shall make no&#xD;
sacrifice in the eye of society. I will render&#xD;
myself worthy of you. As soon as I leave the&#xD;
university, which will now be very soon, I shall&#xD;
place myself with an eminent jurist, and, if I&#xD;
fail not in health and life, it shall, indeed, be&#xD;
your pride to claim me as your lawful protector&#xD;
and liege lord. My native land opens an un-&#xD;
limited field to the ambition of its young men,&#xD;
and every office, even to the highest in the&#xD;
world is accessible to talent, integrity, and right-&#xD;
ly directed ambition. - If all else were Wanting,&#xD;
the consciousness of your love, of your devoted,&#xD;
self-sacrificing spirit, which forgets my humble&#xD;
birth, will spur me to superhuman exertion, that,&#xD;
when I shall come to claim your hand, pledged&#xD;
to me this joyful hour, of your another and your&#xD;
brother, they shall feel no shame or sense of&#xD;
degradation in yieldingtheir free consent. Till&#xD;
then, dear Isabel, though the separation will be&#xD;
painful to me, let us meet but seldom, if at all !&#xD;
Conscious in our mutual love, and looking for-&#xD;
ward to a brighter day, when the cloud that&#xD;
noyv intervenes shall be removed, we can love&#xD;
each other in our absence, as we have done dur-&#xD;
ing the last six years of your absence from your&#xD;
paternal home. Does this proposal please you ?"&#xD;
"It does not please me, but I yield to it, be-&#xD;
cause it is dictated by prudence and sound sense.&#xD;
I thank you., Edward, for suggesting it. It is&#xD;
best that we should see each other but seldom,&#xD;
until the day arrives, when, before the world's&#xD;
eye, you can claim me as your bride."&#xD;
"Yes ; for even, though I were now your&#xD;
equal in birth. I have no profession, and we&#xD;
shotild still have to let time elapse."&#xD;
&#xD;
" You are more discreet and thoughtful than&#xD;
I am. But my fortune would obviate-"&#xD;
" My dear Isabel, do me the justice to be-&#xD;
lieve that I have too much pride to make your&#xD;
fortune the key to my advancement. Under&#xD;
any circumstances I must delay till I have nade&#xD;
a name, or at least a profession. "Will you,"&#xD;
he added smilingly, as he drew her hand to his&#xD;
lips, " will you wait for me four years'?"&#xD;
" Seven-always, Edward, so far as any&#xD;
pledge to another goes."&#xD;
" Thanks, my dear Isabel ! Thanks ! Words&#xD;
are inadequate to express my gratitude to you&#xD;
for the unspeakable honor of your love, and of&#xD;
your confidence in me. May I never prove my-&#xD;
self unworthy of either. Four years will make&#xD;
you nearly twenty-two, and make me twenty-&#xD;
five. We shall then be young, and, I trust,&#xD;
happier than now ; because I shall then have&#xD;
attained a profession in life. But would you&#xD;
cheerfully wait seven years, if in four I won not&#xD;
the position I aspire to, before I. come to claim&#xD;
your hand ?"&#xD;
"Have I not said it, dear Edward ?"&#xD;
"Bless thee-bless thee !"&#xD;
"Curse thee-curse thee, villain !" cried the&#xD;
startling voice of Manfred Lawrence, immedi-&#xD;
ately in the door of the ruin,_ behind the steps&#xD;
on which they were seated, wholly forgetful of&#xD;
all circumstances but what was bounded by the&#xD;
circle of their purest love.&#xD;
As at this hour he should have been at the&#xD;
university, several miles distant, we will ex-&#xD;
plain his sudden appearance at this unhappy&#xD;
moment in the presence of the lovers. We&#xD;
have already given a detailed account of his&#xD;
lawless passion for the beautiful Kate Wynyard,&#xD;
and the signal defeat of his purposes through&#xD;
the courage of Edward Blacklook. Neverthe-&#xD;
less for all this discomfiture, while it increased&#xD;
his hatred against Edward, it did not diminish&#xD;
his determination to carry off the beautiful&#xD;
straw-braider.; for he was one of that vile class&#xD;
of rich young men who would never think of&#xD;
outraging the feelings of a young lady in their&#xD;
own position of society, by attempting to carry&#xD;
her off by force, yet look upon a poor girl, who&#xD;

52                  KATE WYNYARD&#xD;
&#xD;
supports herself by her needle, as fair game for&#xD;
their licentious attempts and ignominious strat&#xD;
agems.&#xD;
He had formed an intimacy with a dissolute&#xD;
young student, who had largely involved his&#xD;
character by dissipation, gaming and unliquida-&#xD;
ted debts.   This person's need   Manfred's&#xD;
abundance from time to time solargely supplied.&#xD;
that at length he became his chief creditor, and&#xD;
held him completely in his power When a&#xD;
man is fallen to such a position of dependence&#xD;
by his own viciousness of life, he is a ready tool&#xD;
for all temptations, and no intriguing designer,&#xD;
who needs an agent, supposes he can be insulted&#xD;
by any proposition. Therefore, one day, when&#xD;
Chester Tunstall came to his room to ask the&#xD;
loan of a sum more of money, Manfred said to&#xD;
him, bluntly :&#xD;
"ITunstall, I am tired loaning you, who never&#xD;
repay."&#xD;
" But I have been infernally unlucky at play,&#xD;
the last three weeks, Lawrence. If you could&#xD;
spare a cool twenty, it- would be a nest-egg by&#xD;
which I could win enough to pay you back the&#xD;
four hundred and odd I am owing you."&#xD;
M lanifred looked a- him with a glance of con-&#xD;
tempt ; for there were even below him, men,&#xD;
who m he could despise, as those above him de-&#xD;
spised hin.&#xD;
'- So you always say. Tunstall."&#xD;
but I've learned a trick from a gambler,&#xD;
Lawrence-an admirable trick-that cannot fail&#xD;
to bring me lots of stakes."&#xD;
"Do you resort to chewing. Tunstall ?"&#xD;
"One must do it," answered the young nman,&#xD;
slightly coloring.  " One can't starve and be&#xD;
ruined. I must pay my debts ; and cheating is&#xD;
fair when those you play against cheat."&#xD;
" I have nothing to say. Your circumstances&#xD;
seem desperate."&#xD;
"Yes, you have come near the mark."&#xD;
"I can propose to you a way of getting out&#xD;
of them."  And he bent his eyes closely upon&#xD;
his face.&#xD;
"In what manner?" asked the gamester, ea-'&#xD;
gerly.&#xD;
".By doing me a favor."&#xD;
&#xD;
Name it."&#xD;
"It is-but first let me tell you what I&#xD;
propose to pay. I will give you a receipt in&#xD;
full for what you owe me, and one hundred dol-&#xD;
lars down, if you succeed."&#xD;
"Done. Name it, Lawrence."&#xD;
"It is to kill a man!"&#xD;
"What-killaman ? No. Youdon't meanit!"&#xD;
" Have I not said it ?"&#xD;
Tunstall shook his head and regarded Law-&#xD;
rence, who stood unmoved before him with-&#xD;
out moving a muscle, with surprise and doubt.&#xD;
"Do you think I am so desperate as that,&#xD;
Lawrence ?" he asked, with guilty embarrass-&#xD;
ment, and an attempt to look indignant.&#xD;
"I am not making myself your judge in mat-&#xD;
ters personal to you, Tunstall."&#xD;
" Do you really wish me to commit a mur-&#xD;
der ?"&#xD;
"I have told you what I wish."&#xD;
" Who is the man'?"&#xD;
"It is no matter who, till I know whether you&#xD;
will do*it or no ?&#xD;
"For five hundred dollars ! It is a small&#xD;
sum," said the young man, with a thoughtful&#xD;
air; " a confounded small sum ! especially if&#xD;
here was any chance of being found out "&#xD;
" If a man will commit a murder at all, I&#xD;
don't see why'he shouldn't do it for five hun-&#xD;
dred dollars !"&#xD;
" That's true-say a thousand !" he cried,&#xD;
abruptly.&#xD;
Here Lawrence laughed audibly, with a sneer-&#xD;
ing tone, and said :&#xD;
" 1 do not wish you to do any murder, Tun-&#xD;
stall.  I did but: test you on this improbable&#xD;
point, in order to see if I could depend on you&#xD;
upon a lesser. I have no hatred to gratify, that&#xD;
I cannot be my own avenger.",&#xD;
"You were hardly fair to try me in this&#xD;
way," answered Tunstall, trying to smile, and&#xD;
looking as guilty as if he had really committed&#xD;
the deed; for he had learned a humiliating les-&#xD;
son in the volume of his own depravity, that for&#xD;
a thousand dollars he could consent to assassi-&#xD;
pate a fellow-betng. He dropped his eyes before.&#xD;
the haughty and cold glance of his superior, for&#xD;
&#xD;
he felt that by his own mouth he had forever&#xD;
sealed his own degradation and unmistakable in'&#xD;
famy, in the eyes of Manfred Lawrence.&#xD;
"I wish you, however," said Lawrence, " to&#xD;
do a deed for me, that I would rather have per&#xD;
formed by another than myself, because my ap&#xD;
pearance on the ground at all would lead to sus&#xD;
picion. I want you to aid me in running away&#xD;
with a young girl."&#xD;
"That is quite another affair," answered the&#xD;
young man, with a look of infinite relief.&#xD;
"-She is poor, and I am in love with her.  I&#xD;
tried it once but was defeated. I am resolved&#xD;
to try it again. if you will undertake the af-&#xD;
fair, and follow strictly my directions throughout,&#xD;
I will give you your debts to me, and pay you&#xD;
one hundred dollars beside."&#xD;
"Done.   Who is the girl ?"&#xD;
"Will you swear secrecy ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
" If you betray me I will have you thrown&#xD;
into prison for that forgery of my name!"&#xD;
" What-what-what--forgery ?" he gasped&#xD;
out.&#xD;
" Do not deny what I have certain knowledge&#xD;
of. Did you not, five weeks ago, draw from my&#xD;
father's banker in Boston, sixty-five dollars, by&#xD;
forging my own name to a check'? You sup-&#xD;
posed it would never be detected, but he sup.&#xD;
posed I drew it and no inquiries were made in&#xD;
the settling up of the cash accounts. But that&#xD;
very day~I went to the banker to draw thirty-&#xD;
five dollars, and he remarked, 'This, and the&#xD;
sixty-five paid to your order this morning, will&#xD;
make just one hundred.' So you see I know it.&#xD;
But I did not speak of it, because I knew I&#xD;
had you in my power, and that some day I might&#xD;
want to use you. The day has come."&#xD;
"You will not prosecute, 'Lawrence ?" he&#xD;
asked, with alarm, but without manifesting the&#xD;
least particle of shame at the discovery.&#xD;
"Not if you are secret and true to me in this&#xD;
matter."&#xD;
"Iswear to be so. I will do what you say I&#xD;
If you should give me up, what would become o&#xD;
me! ,Think of the respectability of' my fam-&#xD;
ily."&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
r   " You seem wholly to have forgotten it your-&#xD;
- self, from this act and others."&#xD;
" It would be penitentiary for life !"&#xD;
" You are thinking more of the punishment&#xD;
- of your crime than of its baseness. But that is&#xD;
- your affair. The young girl's name is Kate&#xD;
Wynyard."&#xD;
" The handsome straw-braider! She is a&#xD;
prize, Lawrence."&#xD;
" You know her then ? So much the better,&#xD;
you can make no mistake."&#xD;
" Not . She is worth carrying off. When&#xD;
do you want me to do it?"&#xD;
" I will let you know. In a very few days,&#xD;
however. In the meanwhile, I want you to ex-&#xD;
amine and make yourself fully acquainted with&#xD;
the precincts of the cottage where she dwells,&#xD;
on the river side. Go this evening and see the&#xD;
position of windows, walks, gates, and take&#xD;
every observation that will be of use to you ;&#xD;
for you are to conduct the whole matter, I not&#xD;
appearing in it at all., Here are fifty dollars.&#xD;
This is for you to pay your bill at the livery sta-&#xD;
ble, and to secure a close carriage to be ready&#xD;
at your order at any moment. Everything must&#xD;
be done as for yourself."&#xD;
- "I understand it. I will be as wise as a ser-&#xD;
pent. But where shall I go ?"&#xD;
" I will give you your instructions more partic.&#xD;
ularly in a day or two."&#xD;
After some further conversation, Tunstall left&#xD;
and Manfred walked out. It was on this very&#xD;
occasion that he was encountered by Captain&#xD;
Wat and so publicly insulted. ie returned to&#xD;
his rooms, burning,with rage. He at once sent&#xD;
for Tunstall, and thus addressed him:&#xD;
" The girl's brother, a fire eating sail  is re-&#xD;
turned. He met me half an hour ago, and in-&#xD;
sulted me after a manner that has no forgiveness.&#xD;
That lowborn hypocrite, Blacklock, was with&#xD;
him."&#xD;
" I hate Blacklock, he is always so virtuous&#xD;
and confoundedly correct, as if he carried all the&#xD;
goodness that is on earth under his own vest."&#xD;
" You can't hate him worse than I do, and&#xD;
that you may have a stronger incentive to serve&#xD;
me in this affair, I inform you that Blacklock&#xD;

loves her, and that you will despite him by car-'&#xD;
rying her off."&#xD;
"That will do,' answered Tunstall, mali-&#xD;
ciously.&#xD;
" This brother. I know nothing about, save&#xD;
that he ran away to sea some years ago, and has&#xD;
now returned, looking more like a pirate than&#xD;
an honest sea farer. Blacklock, no doubt, knows&#xD;
how to choose his acquaintances. You must be-&#xD;
ware of both of these. I am resolved the af-&#xD;
fair shall come off without delay, for this broth-&#xD;
er may take her to sea with him."&#xD;
" Hadn't we best wait until we know that to&#xD;
be so, and that he has gone without her ?'&#xD;
" No.  At once, or not at all!  He can't be&#xD;
at home always; nor "&#xD;
At this moment the janitor that waited upon&#xD;
the rooms of that floor came in to perform some&#xD;
duty of hi bustling office, and being, like a bar.,&#xD;
her, of a news-telling and gossipping turn, he&#xD;
said, as he filled the water pitcher :&#xD;
" You didn't hear the news, did ye ?"&#xD;
" No," answered Manfred, who was waiting&#xD;
impatiently for him to leave.  "You are not&#xD;
needed."&#xD;
" There is a report that Captain Davy Black.&#xD;
lock, the tavern keeper, fell dead this morning&#xD;
in his bar."&#xD;
" 0, that is-his father. This is good news,"&#xD;
said Lawrence, aside, to Tunstall. " It will&#xD;
keep him out of the way, at least ! The funer-.&#xD;
al will take place to-morrow, when, doubtless,&#xD;
the captain, his friend, will be there.  That&#xD;
will be the time-to-morrow night !"&#xD;
" The fair Kate may go too !"&#xD;
"It is not likely.  You must ascertain that,&#xD;
and act according to circumstances."&#xD;
Is it Miss Kate Wynyard, sir, you named ?"&#xD;
said the inquisitive janitor.&#xD;
" What are your long ears doing; fellow ?"&#xD;
demanded Lawrence, angrily, and rapidly re&#xD;
viewing his words in his mind, to see if he had&#xD;
said anything by which he could be harmed.&#xD;
" There's news about Miss Kate, the widder'i&#xD;
darter, whether I heard her name or not," an&#xD;
swerved the man, doggedly.&#xD;
" And what is the newsV'"&#xD;
&#xD;
" Thal her runaway brother, Walter, a right&#xD;
wild chap in his boyish days-I recollect him&#xD;
well-has come back rich as a king, and given&#xD;
his mother twenty thousand dollars, all in yellar&#xD;
gold ; and his sister fifty thousand. He's been&#xD;
up to the town to day to put it all in bank for&#xD;
em.&#xD;
"This is a silly rumor."&#xD;
"Not a bit of it, for I heard Professor --&#xD;
saying to Doctor - that he was in the bank&#xD;
when the captain-for he is a captain-came&#xD;
in and pat down ten thousand of it "&#xD;
" Then there may be some truth in it ; and&#xD;
ten thousand is the whole sum, I dare say."&#xD;
"This alters the case of our affair, then,"&#xD;
said Tunstall, aside. "You'lldo nothing now!.&#xD;
"It does not alter the case one jot.  Rich or&#xD;
poor, it is the same to me. You will act as if&#xD;
this were not known to you."&#xD;
" And there's whisperings, sir, that he's come&#xD;
in a strange, piratical craft, all black, and low,&#xD;
and long-black-snakish like-and that the rev-&#xD;
enue vessel boarded her, taking her for a buk-&#xD;
kany, or a smuggler ; bur couldn't prove any-&#xD;
thing against her. But i'll venture to say Wat&#xD;
Wynyard didn't never come by ten thousand&#xD;
dollars in an honest way, if he could get it in&#xD;
any easier way than workin' for it. It's a&#xD;
mighty hehp o' money, and I ha' my 'spicions,"&#xD;
said the old man, shaking his head as he went&#xD;
out of the room.&#xD;
"You hear this.  We must act promptly. If&#xD;
this captain is looked upon in this suspicious&#xD;
way, he wontstay here long ;'and lest he might&#xD;
remove his mother and sister from that miserable&#xD;
cottage to some place unknown, as, if he is rich,&#xD;
he will be likely to do, I say that to-morrow&#xD;
night you must act. We shall be sure that&#xD;
I lacklock (of -hose presence Lawrence had a&#xD;
lively fear) will then be at home, where he will&#xD;
probably remain for some days. The captain&#xD;
must be got away by some ruse, some note sent&#xD;
by some one, as from Blacklock, or from his&#xD;
banker in town, or from anybody that will toll&#xD;
- him away from the house, till you can get Kate&#xD;
out of it into your carriage."&#xD;
" I will manage it as you wish; and he sure,&#xD;
&#xD;
Lawrence," added Tunstall, "you will have no&#xD;
reason to find fault with my tact."&#xD;
"Now hear my plan. To-morrow at dusk,&#xD;
you will have a carriage, with deaf Jacob to&#xD;
drive (be sure you have him, so that he can be-&#xD;
tray nothing), down at the corner of the lane&#xD;
that leads to the cottage. It must stand directly&#xD;
in the middle of the road, with the horses' heads&#xD;
turned towards the turnpike south. You will&#xD;
then ascertain if the brother is out of the way.&#xD;
If he is not, you will send to him Ket, whom&#xD;
you know, a man whom you will have with you,&#xD;
and a man you can trust, too. Ket will take a&#xD;
note as from Blacklook, earnestly asking him to&#xD;
come to him at the inn. This will take him&#xD;
from the premises. When the coast is clear,&#xD;
you will then rush to the cottage in alarm and&#xD;
askfor a light, and say in explanation; that a&#xD;
man, who seems to be a seaman, has been run&#xD;
over in the road.  This will bring Kate, who&#xD;
will supp }se it to be her brother, after you, at&#xD;
once to the carriage, when you will place her in&#xD;
gently, but forcibly, and don't harm her, on&#xD;
your life !"&#xD;
"But the widow ?"&#xD;
"She is-too lame to leave the house to inter-&#xD;
pose."&#xD;
"This is an admirable plan."&#xD;
"And I hope the execution will be as admir-&#xD;
able as the conception."&#xD;
"Do not doubt that, Lawrence. But where&#xD;
amI to drive the carriage, when I have her safe&#xD;
in it ?"&#xD;
"That I am about to tell you. The residence&#xD;
of my mother you know."&#xD;
"Yes. I once went there .with you when you&#xD;
 owned the fast gray.".&#xD;
Yes.  So much the better.  You will drive&#xD;
to Grasmere Hall at once, and at good speed."&#xD;
"You don't mean to take her to your moth-&#xD;
ers ?&#xD;
"2Not exactly. I shall be on the road to&#xD;
meet you before you reach the:e, to turn you&#xD;
aside by-a by-road that leads to the house of a&#xD;
&#xD;
woman in the forest, who is in my ay.&#xD;
&#xD;
The&#xD;
&#xD;
house is a large, two-story brick one, a hundred&#xD;
years old ; but the family that now occupy it&#xD;
are of a very different rank from that which first&#xD;
occupied it in the aristocratic days of the colo-&#xD;
nies. This house is on a part of my estate, and&#xD;
I have had a couple of rooms fitted up there this&#xD;
year past, where I have give suppers and din-&#xD;
ner parties to my particular friends. It is per-&#xD;
fectly retired, and no one goes or comes from&#xD;
there save the woman's son Ket, who will be&#xD;
under your direction in this matter; and who,&#xD;
should you miss me, will show you where to turn&#xD;
in to drive to the house. You have now your&#xD;
directions. To-morrow at sunset you will find&#xD;
Ket waiting at the stable in order to direct deaf&#xD;
Jacob where to meet you at the head of the cot-&#xD;
tage lane."&#xD;
" I understand my directions clearly now,"&#xD;
answered  Tunstall, with an   air of elation.&#xD;
"There is no doubt I shall succeed to your&#xD;
heart's satisfaction. Had I not better take a&#xD;
pair of pistols with me ?"&#xD;
"No. You may use them when you ought&#xD;
not. If you are in great peril from arrest,&#xD;
your best course will be to leave the girl and&#xD;
save yourself; for I' have little confidence in&#xD;
you, Tunstall, to keep my secret if you were,&#xD;
brought up for this offence."&#xD;
" I would be as silent as an Egyptian mum-&#xD;
my."&#xD;
After some more particulars of conversation,&#xD;
the young men separated for the day. - The&#xD;
same night, Tunstall played successfully his&#xD;
part of spy about the cottage,; and what be saw&#xD;
of Captain Wynyard's looks, revealed to him&#xD;
through the trellised window, did not please him,&#xD;
they were so decidedly brave, and determined,&#xD;
.and full of- fight. 'He, therefore, resolved to play&#xD;
his cards with the greatest wariness, in order not,.&#xD;
to come in collision with such a truculent look-&#xD;
ing young sailor.&#xD;
The ensuing day, as Lawrence had expected,&#xD;
Captain Wat went to the funeral of the publi,&#xD;
&#xD;
54                KATE WYNYARD.&#xD;

&#xD;
can. He pulled up in his boat, taking his love-&#xD;
ly sister with him. But he returned early,&#xD;
reaching the cottage just about the time that&#xD;
Edward was encountered by Isabel on the steps&#xD;
of the old church tower. That the captain had&#xD;
taken his sister Kate to the Brown Bear, was&#xD;
known to Lawrence through his agent Ket, who&#xD;
kept watch for the purpose of ascertaining all&#xD;
their motions. When Lawrence found they had&#xD;
left the cottage for the funeral, he also mounted&#xD;
his horse and took his way to the Brown Bear,&#xD;
which he reached just after the coffin had been&#xD;
borne away by the pall-bearers. He, however,&#xD;
went in and spoke with several old men and old&#xD;
dames, who remained, being too aged to proceed&#xD;
to the churchyard. He also spoke to the ostler&#xD;
and gardener ; and took, in this way, particular&#xD;
pains to make it appear that he had been there.&#xD;
He then proceeded homeward, on the way speak-&#xD;
ing to several persons whom he knew, both at&#xD;
their doors, by the road-side, and on the way,&#xD;
and with such affability, that it was commented&#xD;
upon after he had passed by. Just before dark&#xD;
he reached Grasmere Hall and put his horse up&#xD;
and walked towards the churchyard, meeting&#xD;
the chaises and people returning.   All this&#xD;
pains he took, in order, when the forced flight&#xD;
of Kate should be noised abroad, fifty people,&#xD;
at least, could attest to having seen him nine&#xD;
miles from her cottage at sunset, or thereabout.&#xD;
But in order to have undoubted and later testi-&#xD;
mony, he made three country gentlemen, who&#xD;
had come in on horseback to the funeral, alight&#xD;
and go in to take supper with him, intending to&#xD;
keep them until the latest moment that he&#xD;
thought he could so without failing to meet the&#xD;
carriage a quarter of a mile off to go to the old&#xD;
colonial house. As the two of the three country&#xD;
gentle'.en entered, the third, pleading business&#xD;
at home, Lawrence asked for his sister, in order&#xD;
to present them to her. The servant said she&#xD;
had gone, five minutes before, towards the river&#xD;
to speak to some gentleman whom she was wish-&#xD;
ing to overtake.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Do you know who he was ?" demanded&#xD;
Lawrence, with his habitual suspicion.&#xD;
"No, sir. He was tall, and dressed in deep&#xD;
mourning. He was afoot, and passed round by&#xD;
the outside of the grapery wall ?"&#xD;
"In deep mourning'?"&#xD;
" Yes, sir ; and -I was thinking it might be&#xD;
one of the mourners to Mr. Blacklock's fu-&#xD;
neral."&#xD;
"Gentlemen, you w ill excuse me a few mo-&#xD;
ments.  My mother, whom you know, will do&#xD;
the honors. I will be in very shortly."&#xD;
Abruptly leaving them in the outer hall in&#xD;
charge of his mother, he descended into the&#xD;
flower parterre, and hastened down the gravelled&#xD;
walk towards the river. .As he went on, he&#xD;
said to himself :&#xD;
"If it turns out to be Edward Blacklock,&#xD;
I'll send him this night to lie in the same grave&#xD;
with his father. I am fortunately armed, to&#xD;
ward off any.attempt to recover the fair Kate&#xD;
after she is once in my hands. But if this man&#xD;
be he, he shall have their leaden contents."&#xD;
He soon came to the foot of the bluff. The&#xD;
moon was just risen, and beautifully silvered&#xD;
the edges of the ruin, and gleamed brightly&#xD;
through the open arched windows. He crept&#xD;
stealthily to the summit, for he thought he heard&#xD;
voices from that quarter. He entered the ruin&#xD;
amid the shadows on the western end. All was&#xD;
quiet. But he saw upon a column at the far-&#xD;
ther end, the shadows of two human heads. The&#xD;
individuals were not in sight. He watched these&#xD;
telltales, and perceived, by the, form, that they&#xD;
were the shadows of a man and woman. He&#xD;
now went softly over the rough pavement of the&#xD;
church, and at length reached-the southern door,&#xD;
which looked down upon the Charles river, flow-&#xD;
ing beneath. Here he saw the substantial fig-&#xD;
ures which had thrown the shadows upon the&#xD;
massive column.  He stood within twelve feet&#xD;
of Edward and Isabel, and, himself unseen,&#xD;
listened to all they said. Patiently he waited to&#xD;
hear the last word-to hear all that either would&#xD;
&#xD;
say-restraining his rage and fierce revenge&#xD;
with difficulty, till a fitting moment.  That mo-&#xD;
ment arrived, and with his voice of thunder, he&#xD;
made both of them start to their feet.&#xD;
"Ay, curse thee ! villain !" he repeated, as&#xD;
Edward turned to meet his gaze, surprised, in-&#xD;
deed, but not alarmed, while Isabel sprang be-&#xD;
tween them to prevent collision.&#xD;
" Manfred, be quiet ! Edward, heed him&#xD;
not, for my sake ! Brother, if you have over-&#xD;
heard all, you know all!  Nay, do not menace&#xD;
me!   I am independent of you.  I will not be&#xD;
&#xD;
dictated to. Edward Blacklock is every whit&#xD;
as noble. in heart as yourself. You have no&#xD;
cause of hostility against him."&#xD;
"Do not stand in my way, woman !" he&#xD;
cried, savagely. " You have disgraced your-&#xD;
self.  Stand back! 1 will take his life !"&#xD;
He drew his pistol and levelled it at Black-&#xD;
lock, when Isabel caught his arm, and turned&#xD;
the weapon aside. In a paroxysm of fury at her&#xD;
interference, he struck her with the barrel of the&#xD;
heavy pistol in the temple, and felled her bleed-&#xD;
ing to the earth,&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
The wounded sister.    Her concern for her     brother.  The forged note.   Assault upon&#xD;
Edward.    He beats of  his assailants, and recognizes in the fallen foe the features c l&#xD;
Manfred Lawrence.     A  second abduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
, ANFRED LAWRENCE had no sooner&#xD;
struck Isabel to the ground with the&#xD;
pistol, than cooking it, he levelled it at Edward's&#xD;
breast.  But the latter, animated by indigna-&#xD;
tion at seeing Jhe maiden fall beneath the blow,&#xD;
sprang forward ana eauget the pistol with such&#xD;
a grasp of iron, that in an instant it was in his&#xD;
hand and Lawrence at his mercy.&#xD;
"Dastard ! Thou art her brother, or I&#xD;
would not let thee live an instant. Fly ! Away,&#xD;
I say, or I shall take your life !" And Ed-&#xD;
ward fired off the pistol in the air, and then&#xD;
flung it at his head, as he was retreating with&#xD;
his hands elevated before his face, as if he ex-&#xD;
pected each instant to feel the ball in his.brain.&#xD;
" Poor Isabel !" said Edward, bending down&#xD;
to raise her from the ground, where she lay&#xD;
moaning with a gash in her temple. As he&#xD;
lifted her inanimate form in his arms, the mo-&#xD;
tion caused a red rivulet of blood to flow from&#xD;
the wound, which at once revived her.&#xD;
" Heaven be blessed !" he said, as he saw&#xD;
her open her eyes.  "You are not much hurt,&#xD;
I hope'?"&#xD;
"0, my brother ! Where is he ? I hope-'----"&#xD;
and she looked around with horror, as if she&#xD;
expected to discover his body lying upon the&#xD;
ground.  " I hope you have not-"&#xD;
&#xD;
" No ! He has fled ! I did not harm him,&#xD;
for your sake !"&#xD;
She pressed -his hand gratefully, and said&#xD;
quickly, " And are you not hurt'?"&#xD;
"No, Isabel ! You seem to be better."&#xD;
"Yes, yes ! I do not suffer much. Is the&#xD;
wound deep'? I hope not, for I would not bear&#xD;
upon my brow a wound inflicted by a brother's&#xD;
hand !"&#xD;
" It is long and deep; but it may disappear&#xD;
in time, Isabel. How could he do a deed like&#xD;
this !"&#xD;
'Ah, his fiery temper ! How grateful I am&#xD;
that it did not kill me, for he would then, not&#xD;
only have had a murder on his hands, but would&#xD;
have been hanged ! It is a mercy !"&#xD;
"You forget yourself in one who is not wor-&#xD;
thy of. a thought, Isabel."&#xD;
"But he is my brother. I forgive him !"&#xD;
"I shall find it difficult to do so.  Such an&#xD;
injury and assault upon you, my dearest bride&#xD;
-betrothed, can hardly be passed lightly over by&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"But you will not make it a quarrel with&#xD;
him, dear Edward'?" she said, earnestly, as he&#xD;
was binding his white kerchief about her tem-&#xD;
ples to close the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
KATE WYNYARD.                59&#xD;
&#xD;
"No. For your sake, he shall go unpun-&#xD;
ished."&#xD;
"Thanks, thanks !"&#xD;
"jI will try and remember that he' is your&#xD;
brother, whensoever his bearing hereafter may&#xD;
urgently tempt me to forget it " -&#xD;
"You are so good, and noble, and generous,"&#xD;
she answered, with grateful enthusiasm.&#xD;
Edward now conducted her towards the hall,&#xD;
she leaning confidingly upon his arm, partly&#xD;
from the actual need of his manly support,&#xD;
partly, and for the most part, in affection.  She&#xD;
felt it might be a long time before they met&#xD;
again, her brother was so hostile, and Edward&#xD;
having also determined to see her but seldom,&#xD;
until he had established himself in a profession.&#xD;
Before they reached the door, as they passed&#xD;
through an arbor-arch that spanned the path.&#xD;
Edward lingered to take advantage of the sweet&#xD;
seclusion of its shady covert, to bid a tender&#xD;
and passionate farewell to her. With tears in&#xD;
her eyes and tears in his, they at length re&#xD;
sued their walk, and 1.e left her at the door ;&#xD;
but not before assuring himse lf that the wound&#xD;
was not so severe as the fiery vehemence of the&#xD;
blow at first threatened.&#xD;
He turned away from, the ball and retraced&#xD;
his steps to the ruin, in order r to take the path&#xD;
to the inn, where the ntily made widow, Dame&#xD;
Blacklock, he knew was waiting for him, as he&#xD;
had promised to return tiere after the funeral.&#xD;
and remain some days wi;i her in her loneliness.&#xD;
His step was slow and hi. thoughts sad ; for he&#xD;
did not know when he s'iould met t Isabel, who&#xD;
was now  become his  second self again.   Of&#xD;
Manfred he was altogether as forgetful as if they&#xD;
had not met half an hour before in a hostile at&#xD;
titude. He did not even think about him when&#xD;
he took leave of Isabel at the house ; for he&#xD;
had but one thought, it was his parting from&#xD;
her he so dearly loved, which parting was&#xD;
doubly bitter to him, because he felt that it was&#xD;
sorrowful to her also, and he sorrowed for her&#xD;
sorrow. He passed round the ruin, and was&#xD;
attracted once more to the steps on which they&#xD;
were seated when they plighted their troth to&#xD;
each other. He stood there recalling the scene.&#xD;
&#xD;
The moonlight shone upon something that glit-&#xD;
tered upon the ground. He stooped to pick it&#xD;
up, and took from the pavement a bracelet wet&#xD;
with the blood that had oozed from the wound&#xD;
in her forehead.&#xD;
"Wretched brother ! to aim such a murder-&#xD;
er's blow ! This stained bracelet shall be my&#xD;
keepsake. The crimson tide that came warm&#xD;
rrom ner near, hatldyed it and made it sacred.&#xD;
Fortunate prize for my love to cherish !"&#xD;
As he spoke he pressed it to his lips, and&#xD;
then clasped it upon his left wrist He now&#xD;
cast a lingering look at the scene of their plight-&#xD;
ed hearts, and then turned to quit the ruin and&#xD;
hasten to the society of Dame Blacklock at the&#xD;
inn. He descended the rocky side of the cliff,&#xD;
and entered the cart-road that runs along the&#xD;
shore, following the windings of the river. He&#xD;
walked- at a quick step, eager to relieve his&#xD;
mother's widowed loneliness by his presence,&#xD;
for it was full two hours after sundown, and&#xD;
had got about half way to the inn, when he saw&#xD;
a boat coming down at a rapid rate, pulled by&#xD;
four oarsmen. As the moon shone brightly&#xD;
upon the river, he saw that it was the captain&#xD;
of the Despatch schooner, who at the same mo-&#xD;
ment recognized' him as he walked on the&#xD;
shore ; for the boat passed him not twenty yards&#xD;
from the bank.&#xD;
"Aboy, shipmate ! Isn't that your craft,&#xD;
Master Edward'?"&#xD;
Is't you, Captain Walter ?" responded Ed-&#xD;
ward, with accents of pleasure at seeing him.&#xD;
"I thought you rode home in the carriage that&#xD;
you came to the funeral in'?"&#xD;
"Vast rowing ! Pull in a bit on the star-&#xD;
board oars ! That'll do !" he added, as the&#xD;
boat came to within oars length of the spot on&#xD;
which Edward stood. " I did ride home in the&#xD;
hack, and got her home safe too, for a land craft ;&#xD;
but I had not more than sat down to supper&#xD;
with mother and sister, than a long shore chap&#xD;
brought me this note from you, telegraphing me&#xD;
to lay my course for the inn, under all canvass.&#xD;
So as my boat had just come up after me to take&#xD;
me aboard,-for I stay aboard nights, as I can't&#xD;
get a wink o' sleep in a shore bed,-I took her&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7457-00000029"/>&#xD;
60                KATE WYNYARD.&#xD;
&#xD;
and pulled up. Now, what is in the wind?&#xD;
From the cut o' the signals in the billet, I was&#xD;
afraid you had got among the breakers, and&#xD;
needed a boat's crew or so to tow you off."&#xD;
"Received a note from me, Captain Wat?"&#xD;
"Yes. Here it is," answered the captain,&#xD;
taking his cigar from his mouth to stare at Ed-&#xD;
ward, on witnessing his surprised manner, and&#xD;
he drew from the pocket of his drab watch coat&#xD;
a crumbled bit of paper, and handed it to him.&#xD;
"I have sent you no note, captain. There&#xD;
is some mistake."&#xD;
"There it is, in black and white, like a&#xD;
frigate's ports, and your name signed to it, all&#xD;
ship shape."&#xD;
Edward opened the paper, and not being able&#xD;
to make it out by the light of the moon, the cap-&#xD;
tain sprung on shore, and putting his face down&#xD;
close to the paper, puffed away briskly, so that&#xD;
the light of his cigar cast a glare upon it, suffi-&#xD;
cient to enable him to read it. Edward read&#xD;
with astonishment the following words:&#xD;
" CAPTAIN :&#xD;
"I wish to see you without a moment's&#xD;
delay, at the inn. Come, and let nothing pre-&#xD;
vent you. I await you impatiently.&#xD;
"Yours,    EDWARD BLACKLoCK."&#xD;
"This is a forgery, captain," said Edward,&#xD;
with such positiveness, that there was no room&#xD;
in the captain's mind for question. "I never&#xD;
wrote a line of it, nor is the hand-writing at all&#xD;
like mine."&#xD;
"Who, in Satan's name, then, has done it?&#xD;
I have been up to the inn, and there the good&#xD;
lady told me you had not been there since the&#xD;
funeral; and when I read the note to her, she&#xD;
began to be frightened lest something had hap&#xD;
pened to you. So not finding you there, and&#xD;
after waiting awhile, I up helm and lay my&#xD;
course down stream again, hoping to fall in with&#xD;
you, or hear something from you. And you&#xD;
say you don't know anything about it ?"&#xD;
Edward was thoughtful. He held the note&#xD;
in his hand and seemed to be meditating deep&#xD;
ly. All at once he said, in an earnest manner :&#xD;
&#xD;
"Captain, where were you when this note&#xD;
was given you ?"&#xD;
"At the supper-table, at mother's.  Can you&#xD;
find out anything?"&#xD;
Who handed it to you?"&#xD;
" A fellow in long togs-a shore fellow, in a&#xD;
straw hat and a home-made jacket."&#xD;
Edward shook his head. " I can't under-&#xD;
stand this.  Stay !  It was written evidently to&#xD;
give you a row up to the inn. And for what&#xD;
end ?  Ah,,I fear the worst ! I think I can&#xD;
divine the horrible mystery !"&#xD;
" Out with it ! What do you suspect ?"&#xD;
" I can give no other explanation of it. I&#xD;
fear that another attempt has been made to ab-&#xD;
duct Catharine, or perhaps to effect a robbery,&#xD;
for people know you have large sums of gold,&#xD;
in your absence. It is either one or the other."&#xD;
The captain sprang into the boat, and shouted&#xD;
to his men to resume their oars.  " Jump in&#xD;
with me, and let us pull to the cottage. If this&#xD;
is -so, there shall be one man less on earth be-,&#xD;
fore to-morrow morning !"&#xD;
" Stay ! It can't be Manfred Lawrence who&#xD;
has done it, for he was at the ruin just after&#xD;
sunset. It must be, therefore, to - effect a&#xD;
robbery."&#xD;
"In either case I can't delay."  .&#xD;
" I cannot go with you, captain. My duty&#xD;
lies at the inn, where my mother waits for me."&#xD;
"True, true !  Good night !  I will soon&#xD;
learn what this means."&#xD;
" Send me word as soon as possible. I shall&#xD;
be very anxious to hear. There is plainly some&#xD;
mischief behind this forged note."&#xD;
The boat pulled rapidly away from the shore,&#xD;
and descending the stream, was soon lost to the&#xD;
eyes of Edward, though he could for some min-&#xD;
utes hear the stern voice of the captain, urging&#xD;
his men to their utmost exertions.&#xD;
"I fear the worst.  Some wrong or outrage&#xD;
has been perpetrated under cover of this note&#xD;
and the captain's absence. But I must hasten&#xD;
to my mother."&#xD;
Thus soliloquizing, he moved forward on the&#xD;
road, and at the end of a hundred yards he&#xD;
came to a path which went from the river to the&#xD;
&#xD;
right, winding up a little valley.  As he was&#xD;
crossing the line of this path, two men sprang&#xD;
out of the shadow of a large umbrageous tree&#xD;
that grew at the intersection, and one of them,&#xD;
at five paces, discharged a pistol at him, while&#xD;
the other ran in upon him to close with him,&#xD;
armed with a bludgeon. The pistol did not&#xD;
take effect, though he heard the ball cut the air&#xD;
near his ear. All his courage instantly filled&#xD;
his soul and nerved his arm. Brave men in dan-&#xD;
ger always gather about them their bravery as a&#xD;
garment, and with the increase of the peril, their&#xD;
courage rises to meet it. He was unarmed ; but&#xD;
he saw in the bludgeon that was descending&#xD;
upon his head, the weapon of his choice, and&#xD;
seizing the wrist of the man with one band, he&#xD;
struck him such a blow in the breast with the&#xD;
other, that he staggered back, leaving the weap-&#xD;
on in Edward's grasp. He instantly advanced&#xD;
upon his assailant, and aiming a blow at him,&#xD;
missed him only because the man took to flight.&#xD;
The other, however, advanced and snapped a&#xD;
pistol at his head. If it had gone off, our story&#xD;
would here have an end ; but the certainty that&#xD;
his life was doggedly aimed at, roused a spirit&#xD;
of angry resentment in his bosom, and swinging&#xD;
the bludgeon above his head, while the man&#xD;
snapped the pistol a second time in his face, he&#xD;
brought it down with its full weight upon his&#xD;
head, and felled him to the ground ; and in his&#xD;
fall the pistol went off, the ball struck his wrist,&#xD;
cutting nearly in two the stone of the bracelet,&#xD;
which turned it aside almost harmlessly.&#xD;
Edward was now master of the field. But&#xD;
who his assailants were he did not know, as&#xD;
neither of them had spoken a word during the&#xD;
conflict. He stooped down with strange feelings&#xD;
over the man whom   he had, as- he believed,&#xD;
killed, in order to save his own life. But the&#xD;
shadow which the thick tree cast upon the road,&#xD;
prevented him from seeing.his features, which,&#xD;
however, seemed to be those of a negro. He,&#xD;
therefore, took the body by the arms to drag it&#xD;
out into the moonlight, not only that he might&#xD;
see who it was who had so resolutely attacked&#xD;
his life, but be near the water to throw it upon&#xD;
hia to revive him; for he began to experience&#xD;
&#xD;
that strange, inexplicable, mysterious feeling&#xD;
which begins to rise in the bosom of a man who&#xD;
has occasion to suspect that he has killed a fel.&#xD;
low-man. Upon dragging the lifeless and dead&#xD;
weight, he felt certain he was dead ; and his&#xD;
heart beat like lead at the thought.&#xD;
"But it was in self-defence. It was to be&#xD;
either him or me ! I had no alternative."&#xD;
He got the body out into the broad radiance&#xD;
of the moonlight, and turning the face to its full&#xD;
splendor, he clasped his hands together with an&#xD;
expression of gratitude.&#xD;
"Heaven above be thanked-it is a negro !&#xD;
I half believed that I had killed Isabel's broth-&#xD;
er ! This negro has sought my purse-\o I--&#xD;
The hands are white ! It is a black mask !"&#xD;
He tore off from the face the African mask&#xD;
that had deceived him in the uncertainty of the&#xD;
moonlight, and started back with a cry of horror&#xD;
and anguish, as he discovered beneath, the pale,&#xD;
marbled face of Manfred Lawrence. He stood&#xD;
full two minutes gazing down upon him, with the&#xD;
mask in his hand, and in the same attitude of&#xD;
horror and despair.&#xD;
" It is he ! It is her brother ! It is Man-&#xD;
fred Lawrence ! 0, bitter-bitter-bitter hour !&#xD;
How stark and cold he lies ! Is he dead, in-&#xD;
deed ! He may not be so ! I will revive him,&#xD;
if possible. 0, this fearful end of all my bliss !&#xD;
Isabel, Isabel, my Isabel no more !-farewell,&#xD;
forever !"&#xD;
Almost beside himself, the unhappy Edward&#xD;
dragged the lifeless form of his former playmate,&#xD;
and late foe, to the water-side, and dashed water&#xD;
freely into his face. ~ But instead of restoring&#xD;
him, it only made it look more chilly in death,&#xD;
and ran off from the cheeks and nose in drops&#xD;
as if from the marbled features of a chiselled&#xD;
head.&#xD;
" He-is-dead-dead-DEAD! 0, Isabel,&#xD;
I have killed your brother ! Henceforth I am&#xD;
a murderer to thee-though Heaven will acquit&#xD;
me of this dread deed of blood ! Dead ? How&#xD;
cold and stiff he lies ! And by my hand ?&#xD;
This is my work ! I have done this ! I stop-&#xD;
ped the beating of that, heart which God first&#xD;
set in motion. 'I glazed that staring eyeball !&#xD;

&#xD;
I stiffened those waxy white fingers !  I !  I!!&#xD;
I!!!   0,. wherefore was I born to such an&#xD;
hour as this !"&#xD;
He cast himself upon the ground by the&#xD;
corpse, and buried his face in his hands and&#xD;
wept like a child. He felt that he had ship&#xD;
wrecked hope, happiness, honor, life, and all&#xD;
that could give life value. He groaned as if&#xD;
his heart were bursting, as he thought how for&#xD;
ever separate from Isabel this unfortunate event&#xD;
had placed  him.   "Lost-lost-lost to me&#xD;
forever !"&#xD;
He was aroused from this despairing attitude&#xD;
by a step. He sprang to his feet and saw two&#xD;
men advancing rapidly towards him, while one&#xD;
of then with violent gestures, pointed towards&#xD;
him and cried to the other :&#xD;
"He has murdered him ! Letus arrest him !"&#xD;
He stood still by the body until they came&#xD;
within twenty feet, when seeing his fixed bear-&#xD;
ing, the foremost stopped till' his companion&#xD;
came up. They were Tunstall and Ket ; and&#xD;
it was the latter who had been the accomplice of&#xD;
Lawrence, and who had fled from the combat&#xD;
on having the fatal bludgeon taken from him.&#xD;
As we left Tunstall, a chapter or two back, pre&#xD;
paring to carry out the designs of Manfred Law-&#xD;
rence against the beautiful and virtuous Kate&#xD;
Wynyard, we will take our readers with him,&#xD;
and witness his proceedings and success in his&#xD;
new office of pander to the vices of his creditor&#xD;
and money lender; for to such base uses had&#xD;
he put himself, through his own extravagance,&#xD;
dissipation and want of common honor.&#xD;
The carriage with Deaf Jacob upon the box,&#xD;
was at the place designated at the head of thQ&#xD;
lane at the appointed time, just after twilight,&#xD;
when it was too obscure to distinguish the fea-&#xD;
tures of persons many paces off. Tunstall came&#xD;
soon after the carriage, and went on down the&#xD;
lane,. in order to reconnoitre the cottage&#xD;
Through the wii dow he had not only the vexti&#xD;
tion to discover the captain at the suppertable&#xD;
but he had seen, as he stole across the garden&#xD;
the -boat with the four oarsmen near the door&#xD;
He, therefore, saw the necessity of drawing hit&#xD;
an+ ng *ia nha nu em1  ottin  him  nfl wukh th~&#xD;
&#xD;
men. He hastened back to the carriage, where&#xD;
Ket stood by the fore wheel waiting for him.&#xD;
"Did you bring the dark lantern ?" he asked&#xD;
of him.&#xD;
Yes. It is in the coach, lighted."&#xD;
" That is all right. I want you to take a&#xD;
note to the cottage and give it to the captain.&#xD;
He is at supper.  You will act as awkwardly&#xD;
as you know how, and appe ir stupid and igno-&#xD;
rant, so that he need not bother you with&#xD;
inquiries&#xD;
"lIll do that, sartain," answered Ket, who,&#xD;
though a plain farmer's lad, was, owing to the&#xD;
example and training of Lawrence, as thorough-&#xD;
ly wicked as he well could be for his age,&#xD;
which was not more than twenty or twenty-one.&#xD;
Tunstall now got into the coach, and drew&#xD;
from his pocket half a sheet of paper, folded&#xD;
like a note, and with a pen and ink, which he&#xD;
took from a leathern ink-ease, he penned the&#xD;
note which we have already had the happiness&#xD;
to peruse later, by the light of the captain's&#xD;
cigar.&#xD;
The note was delivered by Ket, who was&#xD;
thoroughly disguised by a dress unusual to him,&#xD;
so that Catharine might not recognize. him as&#xD;
one of the two men who had rowed the boat in&#xD;
which Lawrence had before carried'her off from&#xD;
the cottage. After Captain Wat had departed&#xD;
in his barge on his three mile row up the 'river,&#xD;
to obey the forged note, Tunstall waited full ten&#xD;
minutes, and then ran towards the cottage, call-&#xD;
ing out, " Help ! help ! For the sake of Hea-&#xD;
ven, help?"&#xD;
He was met at the door by Catharine, who&#xD;
demanded, in alarm, what had happened.&#xD;
" Miss, are there any men here ?" he cried,&#xD;
on seeing her: "A boat has upset on the river&#xD;
above here, and a Captain Somebody in it is&#xD;
near drowning !"&#xD;
Without reflecting, in her surprise and hor-&#xD;
ror, upon the possibility of a. deception, nor&#xD;
suspecting any, indeed without any thought but&#xD;
that it wad her brother in peril, she cried&#xD;
"Where?    Show me ! . Fly, sir !  0, do&#xD;
&#xD;
not linger here ! I will follow you, and aid all&#xD;
e I can!"                         -   4&#xD;

" This way, miss !" responded Tunstall, with I couraging words, that no harm was meant her,&#xD;

ice of Ket, who had been stationed by the " that hallooing and crying,'and all that, would&#xD;

"Up round by the lane, miss. You can't      " Whither do you take me ?" she cried, in a&#xD;

He soon drew her near where the coach stood, " We'll soon be to our journey's end, Miss&#xD;
hen whistling shrilly, Ket bounded from the Kate."&#xD;
eadow, and both seized her at the same mo-  " If you are taking me where I shall meet&#xD;

ound, to the carriage.  She was so taken by there !"&#xD;
&#xD;
surprise, that she had no time to realize her sit-&#xD;
uation, or to scream. The next moment she was&#xD;
seated by Tunstall, the coach glasses down, and&#xD;
the vehicle, with Ket on the box, rattling off at&#xD;
the rate of ten miles an hour.&#xD;
At length the turning out of the road, where&#xD;
Lawrence had directed them to expect him, was&#xD;
reached, after half an hour's driving, during&#xD;
which Tunstall kept his prisoner quiet by threat-&#xD;
eminag her with instant death. Here they drew&#xD;
up and waited for some time, but seeing noth-&#xD;
ing of Manfred, his pander gave orders to drive&#xD;
on.  It was then, by overhearing Ket say,&#xD;
"Mr. Lawrence has, I guess, gone down to the&#xD;
old house to wait there for us," that Catharine&#xD;
saw through the rmiystery of her capture. She&#xD;
had never seen Tunstall, and she could not ac-&#xD;
count for this violence and abduction by a total&#xD;
stranger ; for m ith all her terrors, she cast over&#xD;
and over in her mind the cause of her being&#xD;
stolen off. The only relief she had was the as-&#xD;
surance from Tunstall that her brother was safe,&#xD;
and the tale had been invented only to toll her&#xD;
from the cottage,&#xD;
It would be difficult to paint to the reader's&#xD;
eye the feelings of terror, despair, and wild&#xD;
amazement that took possession of Kate's bosom,&#xD;
when she found herself borne to the carriage in&#xD;
Tunstall's arnms; 't hese emotions bad not been&#xD;
lessened on the swift journey by his very en-&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have no doubt but you would do yourself&#xD;
some mischief, pretty one, if you could. But&#xD;
you have no weapons,.fortunately."&#xD;
" Why do you take me to him'? - What have&#xD;
I done to you that you should take me from my&#xD;
mother's house in this manner ?" she enticated,&#xD;
with clasped hands.  " 0, sir, release me I"&#xD;
" I should lose five hundred dollars if I did,&#xD;
Kate."&#xD;
"Five hundred dollars! lHe, then, pays&#xD;
you ! You veill take me back for gold then ?&#xD;
You shall have it, if you will take me back !"&#xD;
"Have you five hundred dollars in your&#xD;
purse ?"&#xD;
"Alas, no ! But you shall have it to-&#xD;
morrow."&#xD;
" To morrow is never, when we trust those&#xD;
we don't know, Kate. I hear you are rich, but&#xD;
the money you promise is not so safe on your&#xD;
tongue as it would be in my hand ; while I run&#xD;
no risk about that which is to be paid me."&#xD;
Base slave ! to be hired to-"&#xD;
Here the carriage stopped suddenly ; and Ket,&#xD;
opening the door, said, briefly ;&#xD;
" We are here !"&#xD;
Quicker than thought, Kate sprang through&#xD;
the door, striking Ket so smartly in the eye as&#xD;
she did so, that he jumped backwards, and she&#xD;
fled past him, only, however, to find herself in&#xD;
the strong clutch of an old woman, tall and&#xD;

gaunt, who had come out of the great, black,&#xD;
gloomy forest-house to receive them.~'&#xD;
" Not so fast, young 'un ! You must come&#xD;
in here with me !" And without another word,&#xD;
she drew her, shrieking desperately for aid, to&#xD;
the wildly echoing woods, into the building.,&#xD;
"She's safe with the old 'ooman, and no mis-&#xD;
take," said Ket, laughing and rubbing his face.&#xD;
"She hit me right hard with her little fist. I-&#xD;
shall have a black eye for a week, sartain as the&#xD;
world !"&#xD;
" I thought I had lost her, when she flew out&#xD;
so like a bird.  She's got spirit enough !  If I&#xD;
hadn't had this pistol to keep her quiet, I verily&#xD;
believe she would have whipped me in the,&#xD;
carriage !"&#xD;
" Mother, is he here ?" he shouted, through&#xD;
the locked door&#xD;
" No," was the shrill reply. " Go and tell&#xD;
him !"&#xD;
" I'll send the carriage back, and go with it&#xD;
as far as the cross road," said Tunstall. " Tell&#xD;
him I am there," he added, as he saw Ket tak-&#xD;
ing a crossing through the wood, to reach the&#xD;
hall by a short way.    1&#xD;
Tunstall, then ascertaining from the old wo-&#xD;
man to whom he had called, that the prisoner&#xD;
could not possibly escape, drove back a quarter&#xD;
of a mile to where he had before waited, with&#xD;
the expectation of seeing Lawrence. Here be&#xD;
detained the hack to wait for him to come up&#xD;
with Ket.&#xD;
The latter, in the meanwhile, reached the&#xD;
rear gate of the hall grounds, and entering by&#xD;
it, as was his custom daily, without question, he&#xD;
was crossing the garden to inquire of the gar-&#xD;
dener at his lodge where his young master was,&#xD;
when he encountered Lawrence coming in a side&#xD;
entrance from the highway.&#xD;
You are just in time. Have you your pis-&#xD;
tol with you?"&#xD;
"Yes-and loaded."&#xD;
" So much the better.  Wait here till I get&#xD;
mine.' And meanwhile, hunt up a heavy club."&#xD;
Lawrence hastened to his room, and after&#xD;
five minutes, returned, when~he found Ket arm-&#xD;
&#xD;
ed with a heavy bludgeon, which he had found&#xD;
among the gardener's tools.&#xD;
" That will do. Give me your pistol. Now,&#xD;
follow me !" All this was said in a tone and&#xD;
manner of the highest excitement.&#xD;
" What has happened ?" asked Ket, as he&#xD;
followed him down the walk, in the darkness of&#xD;
its shading foliage.&#xD;
"I have been insulted by that inn-keeper's&#xD;
son, Blacklock. I will take his life ! He has&#xD;
caused me to kill my sister!"&#xD;
"Who are them ?" askedKet, pointing to&#xD;
Edward conducting Isabel homeward.&#xD;
"Keep back here, within the shadows," he&#xD;
said, as he saw them approach the door, and&#xD;
take leave of each other. This sight made his&#xD;
blood boil. That he had not wounded his !sister&#xD;
as fatally as he had supposed, was a relief to&#xD;
his mind; and he had now leisure to turn allhis&#xD;
thoughts towards' Blacklock. He saw him re-&#xD;
turn towards the ruin, and together they follow-&#xD;
ed him unseen.&#xD;
" It must not be done on my grounds, or it&#xD;
will be laid to me," said Lawrence. "He will,&#xD;
be going to the inn. Follow me through the&#xD;
fields to the valley cross .road. There we will&#xD;
meet him."&#xD;
They waited till they saw him quit the ruin,&#xD;
and take the cart road along the river, when&#xD;
they went-round to cut him off.. And all this&#xD;
while Lawrence's mind was so absorbed in the&#xD;
thoughts of vengeance, that he did not once&#xD;
think of Kate Wynyard, or make an inquiry of&#xD;
Ket respecting her, no more than if such a per-&#xD;
son had never existed. But when they reached&#xD;
their stand under the great tree, at the corner&#xD;
of the path, and were lying in wait, he be-&#xD;
thought him of the last duty in which Ket had&#xD;
been engaged, and said, quickly :&#xD;
"What of Kate Wynyard ?"&#xD;
"Safe-at mother's."&#xD;
." That is good news. And Tunstall ?"&#xD;
" In the carriage, at the red gate, waiting for&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Let him wait.  One thing at a time. Let&#xD;
me finish Blacklock's business for him, and&#xD;
shall then have leisure for other matters." .&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER 1X.&#xD;
Tunstall and Ket seek to take Edward.  They are intimidated by his firm bearing.  Rob&#xD;
bery of Lawrence's body.    Its observation  by another party.  Tunstall a prisoner in&#xD;
the boat. Lawrence's body borne to Grasmere Jhll. Edward's sad reflections.      The&#xD;
widow's anguish at Kate's abduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
E have already described the secret at-&#xD;
tack made by Lawrence upon Edward&#xD;
Blacklock when he came into the trap they had&#xD;
laid for him, and also the flight of Ket. The&#xD;
latter fled swiftly for aid, as he feared from&#xD;
what he had experienced, that Edward would&#xD;
get the mastery over them both. He had not&#xD;
gone five hundred yards in the direction of a&#xD;
hut which he knew well, and where lodged a&#xD;
man, whose business it was to fell the trees and&#xD;
cord the wood for the barges to take to the city,&#xD;
when he saw coming towards him Tunstall, on&#xD;
foot.&#xD;
" You are the very man!" he cried to him.&#xD;
" Come back with me.. Edward Blacklock will&#xD;
kill Lawrence.  They are fighting. I came to&#xD;
call old Will Blackburn to aid me, but you and&#xD;
I will do.  You have your pistol?- That is&#xD;
right."&#xD;
They ran back together as fast as they could&#xD;
make speed; and as they went along, side by&#xD;
side, Tunstall, in reply to Ket's inquiry, an-&#xD;
swered, that, being tired of waiting, and hearing&#xD;
some carts coming along, 'he had left the carriage&#xD;
and sent it back to Cambridge, to get rid of it,&#xD;
and had resolved to see Lawrence and stay with&#xD;
him at the hall that night, and return to the&#xD;
university in the morning.&#xD;
They now came up to the spot where the con-&#xD;
test had taken place. Both were armed with a&#xD;
pistol each, for Tunstall had loaned Ket one of&#xD;
&#xD;
his. They saw Edward standing above the body,&#xD;
and heard him distinctly, in his self-accusatkn.&#xD;
call himself a murderer.&#xD;
" Then he is dead, and no mistake," said&#xD;
Ket. "Let us at him ! We'll run in and both&#xD;
fire at once !"&#xD;
" No, no ! It wont do to shoot him, or we&#xD;
shall be taken up for his murder," said the&#xD;
more cautious Tunstall. "We will advance&#xD;
upon him, and call upon him to surrender him-&#xD;
self ! But it can't be possible that Lawrence is&#xD;
really dead ! Yet the body lies there stark and&#xD;
motionless, as if he were."&#xD;
" There is no doubt about it," answered&#xD;
Ket.&#xD;
"Then let us arrest him ! If he resists,&#xD;
shoot him; but not without."&#xD;
They now both advanced, as we have before&#xD;
narrated, and-called upon Edward to surrender&#xD;
himself !&#xD;
" Murderer, stand ! Give yourself up 1"&#xD;
cried Tunstall, "or we will shoot you down !"&#xD;
"Give myself up ?" repeated Edward, slow-&#xD;
ly, as he looked at them through his tears.&#xD;
," Give myself up ! 0, no ; 0, no, no I" he&#xD;
added, with a deep tone of firm resolve.  "I&#xD;
am not to give myself up to be pointed at as a&#xD;
murderer !  Stand back !  Stand back, I say,&#xD;
and let me pass !"  He uttered these last ordere&#xD;
with terrible emphasis and fierce command. He&#xD;
strode straight towards them ! Ket fired his pis-&#xD;

&#xD;
and fled. The ball grazed his bared head,&#xD;
and he still advanced, while Tunstall retreated t&#xD;
step by step before him, covering his breast with fi&#xD;
his pistol's muzzle. " if you advance, I fire !"&#xD;
Edward was reckless of life.  He pressed&#xD;
steadily on, till at length. when he -was within h&#xD;
three paees of Tunstall, the latter, intimidated I&#xD;
by his bearing, and not having nerve enough tok&#xD;
discharge his pistol, threw it down on the ground&#xD;
and ran away to the left. Without heeding him, s&#xD;
and standing over the weapon as it lay on the&#xD;
dew-sparkling grass, Ed ward held his course&#xD;
down the river path, turning neither to the rightI&#xD;
nor the left. His eye seemed to be fixed and&#xD;
looking on vacancy. Tunstall gazed after him, I&#xD;
as if he had been a retiring ghost, till the dark t&#xD;
figure was lost to his eyes in the obscurity of there&#xD;
dark path, along which he moved.E&#xD;
" The man has the courage of a devil!"&#xD;
he said. " He fears nothing !"&#xD;
"There isn't a harder fighter than he is, I&#xD;
guess, in your college, nor no whar," remarked&#xD;
Ket, now coming up. " He is a regular lion,&#xD;
and no mistake at all about it !  Now, sir, let&#xD;
him go ! We'll send the law after him as soon&#xD;
as we see how it fares with master Manfred."&#xD;
"Yes, we can catch him to-morrow.  I hope&#xD;
Lawrence wont prove to be dead.   Let us go&#xD;
and see."&#xD;
They approached the 'silent spot with awe.&#xD;
The motionless repose of the corpse, in the cold&#xD;
moonlight, filled them with dread. They came&#xD;
close to it, and Tunstall, bending over the face,&#xD;
regarded it attentively. - At length he said :&#xD;
" Dead ! He'll never speak again."&#xD;
"That he wont. Well he was al'ays a friend&#xD;
to me," said Ket, who tried to feel badly, as he&#xD;
had lost one who freely paid him gold for his&#xD;
lawless services.  "His mother'll take on; and&#xD;
so'll Miss Isabel I"&#xD;
nfs -cot' I,, ounded unlucky," said Tunstall,&#xD;
his first superstitious awe fading before the&#xD;
claims of selfishness. " I shall not get my&#xD;
hundred now ! It is true, I haven't got to repay&#xD;
him the borrowed hundred; but I should never&#xD;
have paid that any how. It is a dead loss of&#xD;
a hundred t me. Ket I"&#xD;
&#xD;
What, sir," answered Ket, aho was trying&#xD;
o find a pulse in the stiff wxiist, for it was hard&#xD;
or him to realize that his employer was deed.&#xD;
"You had best go and alarm the hall !"&#xD;
"So I had, sir. It wont do to let him lay&#xD;
ere. No good can be done him any how, now.&#xD;
His head is brole in here on the back. He's&#xD;
killed with the cudgel."&#xD;
" Go and bring the servants and a barrow of&#xD;
ome kind, to convey the body borne."&#xD;
"And beant you afeard to stay here alone ?"&#xD;
" No, I have courage enough for the dead.&#xD;
They can do no harm."&#xD;
"II wouldn't trust 'em! Well, I'll go, and&#xD;
be back in twenty minutes, I guess. 0, wont&#xD;
the old lady take on when she hears it? It's a&#xD;
mighty ugly wound, sir !   He couldn't ha'&#xD;
spoke or stirred after he got this blow!"&#xD;
"Let the head alone, Ket, and go at once."&#xD;
Ket departed and was soon out of sight.&#xD;
"Now let me take time by the foiclock.&#xD;
This is my opportunity, or never," he said,&#xD;
when he found himself alone with the body.&#xD;
"He must have had money about him. I never&#xD;
knew him without it !"&#xD;
He then looked carefully around him, and,&#xD;
stooping down, thrust his hand into his vest&#xD;
pocket, out of which he took two or three dol-&#xD;
lars in silver, and a gold pencil case. He then&#xD;
removed his gold watch, by lifting the head and&#xD;
passing the costly chain over it. Having put&#xD;
this hurriedly in his pocket, he turned the body&#xD;
partly over on its side to get at the pocket book&#xD;
in the skirt pocket.  But he could not get it&#xD;
out without cutting the cloth on the outside.&#xD;
This he effected with his own dirk-knife, and&#xD;
drawing forth the pocket, he threw the knife&#xD;
down to open-the book, which he.saw was filled&#xD;
with bank notes, several of which were for one&#xD;
hundred dollars.  He gave utterance to an ex-&#xD;
clamation of surprise and delight, and, without&#xD;
counting them, he closed it and placed it safely&#xD;
in the breast pocket of his own coat. He now&#xD;
proceeds to examine another pocket in which he&#xD;
feels a purse well filled. He has to cut this out&#xD;
also, and, in doing so, wounded the body, and&#xD;
stained both purse and knife with blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I think I have made a good haul of it !"&#xD;
he said to himself, exultingly, as he weighed the&#xD;
purse, heavy with gold, in the palm of his hand,&#xD;
before putting it away.&#xD;
But, unobserved in all this, he is not.  Hu.&#xD;
man eyes are watching him from a boat on the&#xD;
river, towards which his back is turned.  This&#xD;
boat was one of the market boats, which float&#xD;
down both night and day, bound to the city&#xD;
with their small freights of a few dollars value.&#xD;
The three men, or rather two men and a boy.&#xD;
who sailed, had heard, some distance off, the&#xD;
report of the pistol which Ket had shot at Ed.&#xD;
ward, and were on the watch, with their eyes&#xD;
fixed on the bank, at about the spot whence it-&#xD;
came, to see what could have caused it, and the&#xD;
voices which they had also heard.  They were&#xD;
not rowing, but drifting silently along the lim-&#xD;
pid wave with the descending ebb, so that their&#xD;
approach was noiseless to the scene of the mur-&#xD;
der.  The light of the moon was bright enough&#xD;
to reveal, distinctly, the two figures on the shore,&#xD;
that of the murdered man, and that of Tunstall,&#xD;
bending over him.&#xD;
" It be a man murdeiin' a man," said the&#xD;
elder of the boatmen to the others, in a whisper&#xD;
of horror.&#xD;
"Yes, it be so, for I seed the glitter o' his&#xD;
knife stickin' in him."&#xD;
" An' he's robbin' him, too, fayther," said&#xD;
the boy,&#xD;
"Get up the duck-gun, Sol," whispered the&#xD;
old man, resolutely, "and gin it to me ! That's&#xD;
it.  Now you pull the oars softly-don't let him&#xD;
hear ye-and send her right in, smack, to&#xD;
shore !"&#xD;
All this was said and done in less time than&#xD;
we are relating it. The old man, who was one&#xD;
of those tall, strong men of the revolutionary&#xD;
stock, having examined the priming of his gun,'&#xD;
sprang ashore, followed by his son armed with&#xD;
an oar, and his grandson, with a hatchet. Tun-&#xD;
stall was so much occupied, that if they made any&#xD;
noise he did not heed it, his vigilance being di-&#xD;
rected towards the road,, and not towards the&#xD;
river, towards which his back was turned, and&#xD;
&#xD;
from which he evidently suspected no observers&#xD;
of what he was engaged in.&#xD;
"Yes, I have done better by Lawrence dead&#xD;
than alive. I must have got, at least, a thou&#xD;
sand dollars. This is a fair night's-&#xD;
He is startled by a noise behind him. He&#xD;
sees the three river-men advancing, and jumps&#xD;
to his feet, while the guilty blood leaped to his&#xD;
forehead like lightning.&#xD;
"Who you been murderin' there'?" called out&#xD;
the old man. " Give yourself up, or I'll blow&#xD;
you inter the middle o' next week !" And he&#xD;
levelled his long ducking gun at his head, while&#xD;
the two others brandished, one his oar, and the&#xD;
other his hatchet.&#xD;
"I didn't murder him-I-only--T----"&#xD;
"Down on your marrow bones, I say ! Down,&#xD;
quicker !" called out the old boatman, in a&#xD;
stentorian tone, advancing upon him, the green-&#xD;
ish moonlight gleaming along the barrel in a line&#xD;
with his body.&#xD;
" I tell you I didn't kill him ! It was--"&#xD;
The son would not let him finish, but run-&#xD;
ning forward with his uplifted oar, was about to&#xD;
felt him to the earth with it, when Tunstall, as&#xD;
the safest course, under the circumstauces, drop-&#xD;
ped on his knees. The old man then advanced,&#xD;
and sending his boy to the boat for a line, soon&#xD;
had him securely bound with his hands behind&#xD;
him, in spite of his lamentable and ludicrous&#xD;
protestations of innocence; to all which the&#xD;
stout yeomen gave no heed. They then carried&#xD;
him and put him down in the little fore cuddy&#xD;
of the boat and locked him in. Then returning,&#xD;
they examined the body, which they had already&#xD;
recognized as that of Lawrence, whom they&#xD;
knew, as they dwelt not far above the Brown&#xD;
Bear. While they were looking at the corpse,&#xD;
and wondering that one man should kill another&#xD;
to rob him, Ket came on the ground, followed by&#xD;
three servants, who brought a rude barrow, used&#xD;
by the gardener in carrying about heavy plants.&#xD;
The former was not a little suspicious at finding&#xD;
the three countrymen there, and Tunstall absent.&#xD;
He was about to ask where he was, when the old&#xD;
man, who was well known to him, said, as he&#xD;
drew near:&#xD;
&#xD;
KATE WYNYARD.               67&#xD;

A  dreadful murder, Mr. Ket.   We see taken up from the grass. The result of this&#xD;

Got who safe ?" asked Ket, with bewilder- from the Hall with the three serving men. He&#xD;
ment.                                      now went on board, and called out to Tunstall:&#xD;
"The murderer. We heard a shot away up    "I see you have turned robber, if you are.&#xD;

"Where is he?"                             know I didn't do the murder ! O, let me out. I&#xD;
"Locked up in the Cuddy."               shall be murdered."&#xD;
"Let me see him," said Ket; hastening on  Btherbry!&#xD;

Wo is it, in here?" he asked, stooping    " I didn't rob him !" he yelled, in anguish.&#xD;
oW.?"Skipper," said Ket, "will you unlock and&#xD;

from a tomb.   Is it you, Ket?"             The cuddy door being opened, Tunstall was&#xD;

"No, no. Don't think o' lettin' the villain  . They thrust him in again, crying and shriek-&#xD;

" It's master Manfred's watch," exclaimed murder  m I"&#xD;
.et with indignation.  "And you saw him " That is a foul lie," said the skipper's son,&#xD;
'r  .m                                 who was about Edward's age. "I know Black-&#xD;

" He'sunordoubt, the murderer, then," said I would. If you try to lay it on him, I will&#xD;
Retsavaelythrow you overboard, you bloody villain l"                  I&#xD;
"0, Ket,don't believe them. It is false !"  " Did we not see you on the body with your&#xD;
cried Tunstall, from the lobby.            knife in your hand ?" demanded the old man.&#xD;
"We'll see to that, Mr. Tunstall," said Ket, "Have not his things been found on you?&#xD;
with malice ; for, though he had no objections to You'll hang for it, high as Haman was hung for&#xD;
pilfering Lawrence's pockets, himself, he had no killin' Mordecai."&#xD;
favor towards any other person who would fore- Tunstall was about to reply, but he was si-&#xD;
stall him in this privilege. But he resolved to lenced by a threat that he should be gagged if&#xD;
ascertain the fact, before yielding up Tunstall, he spoke again. The men's ire was fairly up&#xD;
altogether. He, therefore, approached the body that he should presume to lay the murder upon&#xD;
again, and searching the pockets, found them all one whom they knew, and loved, and honored,&#xD;
empty, the coat pockets cut, and was 'shown, by -as abovy'suspiciou of such a deed. Tunstall&#xD;
the boatmen, Tunstall's knife, which they had lay on the deck of the cuddy, groaning in an-&#xD;
&#xD;
guish of spirit, and lamenting the dreadful issu&#xD;
of his night's adventure.&#xD;
The body of thy unfortunate Lawrence wa&#xD;
placed 'on tlhRarrow atid bto'rne away, folrowe&#xD;
by Ket, after he had had some talk with the&#xD;
river-men about the disposal of their prisoner.&#xD;
You had best take him right into Boston&#xD;
where you are going," said he.  " He'll be saf&#xD;
er there."&#xD;
e"I was thinkin'," said the old man, whetheri&#xD;
to do so, or to leave him at Cambridge.; but&#xD;
then we'd have to land and walk up to the jail,&#xD;
and he might get away from us ; and besides it&#xD;
would detain us too long, as we must be in Bos&#xD;
ton by daylight, to be in the market,"&#xD;
"I think we'd best take him right into the&#xD;
city, father," said the son&#xD;
This course was decided on, and Ket, shak.&#xD;
ing hands with the two men. left them, and went&#xD;
after the body, leaving Tunstall in the hands of&#xD;
his captors, under charge of this murder, with-&#xD;
out one feelmg of compunction. To his vicious.&#xD;
and selfish mind it was a just revenge uponthim&#xD;
for robbing the body which he had intended to&#xD;
rob himself; and secretly, he resolved, that, in&#xD;
order to get himself avenged on Tunstall, he&#xD;
would never breathe the name of Edward Black.&#xD;
lock as connected with Lawrence's tragic end.&#xD;
Coming to-this resolution, he stopped to hide&#xD;
the watch, purse and pocket-book in a hollow&#xD;
tree ; and, having safely concealed them, he&#xD;
went on after the bearers of the dead.&#xD;
We will now follow Edward-in his retreat from&#xD;
the painful scene of his conflict with the fallen&#xD;
Lawrence.  For some minutes he marched rap-&#xD;
idly forward, with a fixed gaze on.vacancy, and&#xD;
set lip, as if his mind was strung to its utmost&#xD;
tension, by this strong aflliction which had be-&#xD;
fallen him. At length, when he found himself&#xD;
once more back again amid the ruins of the old&#xD;
church, where he had so short a time before&#xD;
been made so happy with the sweet confession&#xD;
of the beloved sister of Manfred,; he cast bin-&#xD;
self upon his face, on the step, and wept long&#xD;
and bitterly;like a very child. His loud sobs&#xD;
rang terribly through the echoing pile, and his&#xD;
Avhole frame was shaken with the mighty emo-&#xD;
-46&#xD;
&#xD;
e tion of his soul. It is a fearful thing to witness&#xD;
manly grief-to see the strong man give way to&#xD;
s womanly weeping ! To woman, tears are natur-&#xD;
i al as the falling dew. But it is man's nature to&#xD;
e hide his grief-to let its fierce current flow with-&#xD;
in, like those subterranean rivers that hide&#xD;
their deep tide underneath the earth's bosom;&#xD;
but as these sometimes find a sudden outlet and&#xD;
then gush forth in deluging, torrents, so will&#xD;
r man's hidden tide of grief oftentimes find vent,&#xD;
t and pour forth its flood of long pent up waters&#xD;
in terrible strength, amazing all with its unex-&#xD;
t pected force. So wept Edward Blacklock ! He&#xD;
wept over the total wreck of all his hopes ! He&#xD;
wept that the life of a human being lay at his&#xD;
hand ! He wept at the grief Isabel would feel,&#xD;
when she should learn that her brother was&#xD;
. dead ! and faster flowed his tears, mingled with&#xD;
groans, and moaning at the overwhelming hor-&#xD;
ror which would take possession of her when it&#xD;
should be told her by whose hand he had fallen.&#xD;
iHe wept, too, for his mother's woe, when she&#xD;
should hear that her son had slain a manI&#xD;
" 0, this is more than I can bear ! more than&#xD;
I can bear ! It will crush me to the earth !&#xD;
Would that it might crush me!  Would that I&#xD;
could die here ! Would that I could yield my&#xD;
life here, in atonement to Isabel for the life of&#xD;
her brother. Never can I be forgiven by her.&#xD;
She will loathe me !   Whither shall I fly!&#xD;
What is to become of me ! I am an outcast and&#xD;
a wanderer on the earth; and I can say with&#xD;
Cain, ' Every man that seeth me shall slay me !'&#xD;
Yes, they will hunt me! Men will be on my&#xD;
track ! Even now they may be upon me ! Shall&#xD;
I suffer myself to be borne to a prison-to be&#xD;
arraigned as a murderer-to be hanged as a mal-&#xD;
efactor,?  No, no! I have, indeed, slain Man-&#xD;
fred Lawrence, but I:sought not his life. But&#xD;
the world will not know this ! I am known to&#xD;
have slain him. Ket, who attacked me,, doubt-&#xD;
less saw m4 kill-him:! , Tunstall, too-and how&#xD;
eanoe he there ?-.-he knows it ! Soon the oflicers&#xD;
of the law will know it*!. I wildly ! I will not&#xD;
degrade Isabel-my mother, more--by being&#xD;
executed. It is enough that they hear that I&#xD;
am a- murderer. Farewell, dear spot ! Fare-&#xD;

&#xD;
well, spirit of Isabel, once here present ! I&#xD;
shall see thee no more ! Henc8forth welcome E&#xD;
death--welcome any fate my dark destiny has in I&#xD;
the future, for a wretch like me !"&#xD;
He km It. He kissed the stone slab! He I&#xD;
rose and stood upon his feet, and raised to- &#xD;
wards heaven his clasped hands, and said :&#xD;
" Mercy-mercy-mercy I Thou knowest I I&#xD;
am innocent in heart of this man's death I Sparea&#xD;
me, and let me not be punished greater than Ic&#xD;
ean bear !"t&#xD;
He then left the ruin, and precipitately de-&#xD;
scended the side which led northward and down&#xD;
the river. He would gladly have gone to the&#xD;
inn to have'seen his mother and taken leave of&#xD;
her ; but he apprehended that he should fall&#xD;
into the hands of some persons who might be in&#xD;
pursuit of him. It lacerated his very soul to&#xD;
leave his mother, on her first widowed day, a&#xD;
prey to her lonely sorrow.   This reflectionI&#xD;
sharpened his anguish. - He hurried onward,1&#xD;
trying to fly from the many thoughts that tor-&#xD;
tured him. He hardly knew whither he was&#xD;
going.  He had some vague notion of reaching&#xD;
Boston and ermbarking, he knew not, cared not,&#xD;
whither. Onward he hastened, keeping close&#xD;
to the river, and moving with a speed that, at&#xD;
the end of half an hour, brought him in sight of&#xD;
the cottage. He was surprised to see it; for he&#xD;
hardly realized where he was, or the rapidity of&#xD;
his movements.&#xD;
"I will stop here and say farewell !" he said,&#xD;
sadly. "They cannot yet have heard of my&#xD;
crime. I will send by Catharine a last fare-&#xD;
well, and ask forgiveness of Isabel-but 0, how&#xD;
can she forgive me'?"&#xD;
The unhappy young man advanced to the&#xD;
cottage door. As he drew near he heard a voice&#xD;
mingled with the notes of deep grief. He rec-&#xD;
ognized it as that of the widow. He opened the&#xD;
door with forebodings of evil tidings to hear;&#xD;
for he now recollected the forged note which had&#xD;
drawn Captain Wat from his home, leaving it&#xD;
unprotected. The door was ajar. He entered&#xD;
softly, and beheld the widow on her knees. and&#xD;
ner race buried in her hands, while tears trick-&#xD;
led through her fingers.&#xD;
&#xD;
"0, mercy-mercy, for my poor child !&#xD;
Shield her from her enemies, Thou who art the&#xD;
Father of the widow and the orphan !" These&#xD;
were the words of earnest supplication which&#xD;
Edward heard, and he knew that some outrage&#xD;
had been committed.&#xD;
" Do not despair?   You do right to trust in&#xD;
Heaven, Mrs. Wynyard," he said, approaching,&#xD;
and speaking with deep feeling.  "It is our&#xD;
only support in deep trouble. But what has&#xD;
happened to Catharine. Where is Captain&#xD;
Walter ?"&#xD;
"0, have you heard of her ?" cried the wid-&#xD;
ow, rising as he spoke to her, and taking him&#xD;
wildly by both hands. "Where is my child ?"&#xD;
"Indeed, I 'do not know. Pray explain, dear&#xD;
Mrs. Wynyard ; what has happened ?"&#xD;
"Catharine has been carried off again ! A&#xD;
young man came here with a note as from you&#xD;
for Walter to go to you instantly. As soon as&#xD;
he had gone, some one came running in and'&#xD;
said he was drowning; and Catharine hastened&#xD;
from the house with the messenger, suspecting&#xD;
nothing but that he was telling her the truth.&#xD;
But she did not come back, and I began to think I&#xD;
should lose both my children, when a black man&#xD;
who works at the tannery, came in and said he&#xD;
had seen two men carry Catharine off in a car-&#xD;
riage. 0, my child I my child! What will be-&#xD;
come of her, Mr. Edward'?"&#xD;
"Where is Walter ?"&#xD;
"lHe was here half an hour ago, and soon as&#xD;
he heard what had been done, he set off with&#xD;
his four men up the road in pursuit. He told&#xD;
me you had written no such note to him."&#xD;
"I did not. It was a trap, I see, to get him&#xD;
out of the way. I deeply sympathize with you,&#xD;
Mrs. Wynyard. I wish I knew where to go&#xD;
with any hope of finding her," he said, forget-&#xD;
ful, for a moment, of his own danger, in his&#xD;
anxiety to relieve the distracted mother, and res-&#xD;
cue the lovely girl.&#xD;
" It is, no doubt, Manfred Lawrence, who has&#xD;
done it," said the widow.&#xD;
Edward's cheek became the hue of death at&#xD;
this name, and then, with all the blood of his&#xD;
heart rushing to his brain he answered, with an'&#xD;

Wynyard's unsuccessful search 'at the house in the forest.  En counter with Ket.&#xD;

iniscence of the past.  Kate on' board.   At home, safe.   Joy of the -mother.&#xD;
joins the captain's vessel. A plighted troth.&#xD;
&#xD;
EAF JACOB was not long in compre-&#xD;
hending that his nautical captors desired&#xD;
him to turn round and go back whence he came.t&#xD;
They seated themselves four inside, and Captain&#xD;
Wat upon the box, and in twenty minutes'&#xD;
driving they were at the door of the lonely&#xD;
brick mansion. Deaf Jacob had sense enough&#xD;
to know that he had been engaged in a lawless&#xD;
affair, and lie very reluitantly found himself in&#xD;
the power of the power which now had control&#xD;
of his movements. He was, however, perfectly&#xD;
submissive, and pointing to the. door with his&#xD;
whip, be uttered a strange squealing sound, in&#xD;
his efforts to talk, and to tell them the young&#xD;
girl was within the dwelling.&#xD;
Captain Wat was soon hammering away for&#xD;
admittance, and no one coming, he broke it&#xD;
open with a log of wood, and entered. All&#xD;
was silent and dark. There was some fire in a&#xD;
grate, by which he lighted a candle that he saw&#xD;
by its faint glare.  With this he went all over&#xD;
the large old house, only three rooms of which,&#xD;
out of ten which it contained, having any ap-&#xD;
pearance of being inhabited.&#xD;
"There is nobody here !" said Walter, to his&#xD;
men, who had followed him in the. search.&#xD;
" The deaf fellow has hung out false signals to&#xD;
us.  But here's fire, and people have been!&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"Perhaps, captain," said one of his men,&#xD;
&#xD;
Escape&#xD;
A rem-&#xD;
Edward&#xD;
&#xD;
they heard us coming, and hid her away."&#xD;
This idea led the captain to institute a search&#xD;
through the cellars and garret ; but with the&#xD;
like results. He then went out to give the driver&#xD;
a railg for his deception, and saw him driving&#xD;
off at full speed, and too far off to be overtaken-&#xD;
on foot. At this he roared like a line gale, and&#xD;
resolved that he would strike at once for Gras-&#xD;
mere Hall, which, from his boyish recollections of&#xD;
the country, he knew was not far distant through&#xD;
the wood.    He expected to find Lawrence&#xD;
there, if not Kate,-or at least to get some in-&#xD;
telligence of her. As he finally got through&#xD;
the forest, and was passing round the wall of&#xD;
the garden, he encountered the bearers of Law-&#xD;
rence's body. Upon learning from them, as&#xD;
they stopped to rest, whose corpse it was they&#xD;
carried, his exclamation expressed his surprise&#xD;
to hear of his sudden death.&#xD;
"He didn't run off with my sister, that is&#xD;
certain," he said, to himself, as the men moved&#xD;
on again. In three minutes more, while he was&#xD;
making his way with uncertainty down the road&#xD;
towards the river, hardly knowing where to go&#xD;
next, and quite shocked at the death of: Man-&#xD;
fred Lawrence, he met Ket. , The latter was&#xD;
making the best of his way to overtake the&#xD;
body, after having lingered, as we have seen,&#xD;
to conceal the watch and pocket-book in a hol-&#xD;
low stump. Upon seeing the five men swing-&#xD;

&#xD;
chap that gave me the note."&#xD;
&#xD;
R Ket made a superhuman effort to break away,&#xD;
and leaving his rent jacket in his hands, was&#xD;
bounding off like a deer, when two of the sail-&#xD;
ors intercepted his flight, and brought him back&#xD;
to Captain Wat, held fast between them.&#xD;
You don't leave us,*hipmate, till you show&#xD;
clean papers," said the captain, as he laid his&#xD;
grasp once more on his collar.  "You know&#xD;
Where my sister is. Tell me at once, or I'll&#xD;
choke you to death "&#xD;
I don't know nothing about her."&#xD;
You brought me the forged note. It was&#xD;
to get me out of the way, while you, or some&#xD;
-other rascal, stole her off. Now, you don't get&#xD;
off till you tell me all."&#xD;
I'll tell you all I know, for it's no harm&#xD;
now, as he's dead," said Ket, fairly trembling&#xD;
3 at the savage countenances of the five men into&#xD;
whose hands he had fallen, all of whom showed&#xD;
either knives or pistols,.and one of them was&#xD;
armed with a cutlass., " She was taken off by&#xD;
Mr. Lawrence, who is now dead'; at least, he&#xD;
was to pay me and another, Tunstall, wile is&#xD;
now a prisonerfor murdering and robbing him.''&#xD;
"And where is she ?-with this Tunstall ?"&#xD;
demanded Captain Wat, ferociously.&#xD;
" No. Tunstall is tied in the cuddy of a&#xD;
boat, down on the river, and on his way to pris.&#xD;
&#xD;
ing down towards him, he recognized Captain&#xD;
Wat at once, and divining his errand, turned&#xD;
short to avoid meeting him, and tried to climb&#xD;
the wall into the lawn.&#xD;
"Ho, avast there, shipmate, or I'll give you&#xD;
a broadside !" he called out, clicking his pistol.&#xD;
" We are on a war cruise to-night, and bring&#xD;
everything to."&#xD;
Ret, finding that, if he attempted to get over&#xD;
the wall, he would be dropped by a leaden bul-&#xD;
let, came into the road again, trusting that he&#xD;
would not be recognized by him.&#xD;
." What do yer want ? I'm in a hurry !" he&#xD;
said, trying to appear unconcerned.&#xD;
"All in good time, lad. Have you seen any-&#xD;
thing of a young woman? or-   By the lord&#xD;
Harry !" he exclaimed, springing forward and&#xD;
grasping him by the collar. "You are the very&#xD;

free if I tell you ?"&#xD;
"Yes-if you tell the truth, and she is res-&#xD;
cued in honor."&#xD;
" Then, she is at the old. red house in the&#xD;
forest."&#xD;
" The house which you reach by a turn in&#xD;
the road, with- two ruinous wings, and one&#xD;
chimney fallen ?"&#xD;
"Yes-that is my mother's     Your sister&#xD;
was left there by the hack, two or three hours&#xD;
ago."&#xD;
"She is not there. The house has not a&#xD;
soul in it. I have searched it from garret to&#xD;
cellar."&#xD;
At this Ket showed signs of surprise.&#xD;
"If she aint there, I'm plagued if I know&#xD;
where she is. I left her there with the old&#xD;
woman."&#xD;
" Nobody is there. You must 'go with me&#xD;
until you can tell me a better tale than this.&#xD;
Tie him, lads."&#xD;
One of the men removed his long scarf from&#xD;
his neck, and bound his hands behind him with&#xD;
it, and then tied the ends of the scarf to his&#xD;
own knife belt, so that he could. not get away.&#xD;
"I tell ye, I don't know where she is, if she&#xD;
aint to home, nor the old woman, nuther,"&#xD;
howled Ket. "Mr. Lawrence didn't see her&#xD;
at all, afore he was killed. You ought n't to&#xD;
hurt me, when I've told all I know ; and you&#xD;
ought n't to punish me, when I was only obey-&#xD;
ing his orders. If you want to have your re-&#xD;
venge on any one, you should find Tunstall.&#xD;
It was he that held her in the coach.".&#xD;
"I'll try and find him, if the law doesn't&#xD;
keep him too close, you may be assured. But&#xD;
I shall keep you, too."&#xD;
"There's my old woman, now!" yelled Ket,&#xD;
pointing to a tall female figure striding along&#xD;
in the bright light of the moon, in the middle&#xD;
of the road, and panting as if she were out of,&#xD;
breath, while she muttered curses as she walked.&#xD;
"Then, capture her," cried the captain, to&#xD;
two of his men. The woman was coming from&#xD;
the direction of the river. Her head was bare,&#xD;
and the gray hair, which was cut short, liae a&#xD;

was open and disordered, and stuck or knotted  " You have given us good news, woman,"&#xD;

two men detach themselves from the group, and where she disappeared."&#xD;
approach the spot where she stood, she uttered " I'll not tell you a word if you throttle me."&#xD;
a fierce oath of defiance, and started on a run " The dam has more pluck than her chicken,"&#xD;
that soon distanced the seamen, unused to giving said one of the men.&#xD;
chase on land.                                "Lead her along, Jack,"    said Walter;&#xD;

"All good friends, mother. They didn't woman, and that the carriage had driven off,&#xD;
know it was you."                          she resolved, with the courage and resolution&#xD;
Then, I'm pesky glad to meet with ye and which was a part of her character, to take this&#xD;
your company ; for I want ye to help find the opportunity to effect her escape, even at the risk&#xD;
girl.  She's broke out and took to the woods, of losing her life. The room in which the wo-&#xD;
and I after her, till I've lost her this quarter of man had taken her was on the first floor, a large,&#xD;
an hour, and I've run myself to death. She ill-furnished and gloomy apartment. Her jailer&#xD;
took for the river, and I in full chase ; but I lost had locked the door on the inside, and taken&#xD;
sight of her down below here a piece, and hear. out the key, and the wooded shuts, were closed,&#xD;
ing you up' here, I thought it might be her. so that no light came in, except what was ad-&#xD;
Just you put in that direction, and you wont mitted through the circular openings in the tops&#xD;

she was talking she was approaching them;'but Catharine'looked round and surveyed all her&#xD;
when she came so near as to see that Ket was tied prison at a glance. At the back of the room&#xD;
and a prisoner, and that the men were seamen, was a trap door that led into the cellar by half,&#xD;
and armed, she made an attempt to escape by a dozen slipping steps.,. This door was raised,&#xD;
racing past. But she was captured, though not and the lid hanging back again tlthqttruckle-&#xD;
without a severe combat, and being finally fairly bed.  +rom where she sat she could see that it&#xD;
knocked down by Jack with the butt end of his was where they kept their wood andgvegetables,&#xD;
pistol. She was, however, stunned only for a The darkness, howeyer, was illumsined by what&#xD;
moment; and, on coming to herself, she found seemed to her to he light from some outlet un-&#xD;
&#xD;
der the house. In a faint hope that she might&#xD;
by this means effect her escape, she resolved to&#xD;
make the attempt ; and suddenly springing up,&#xD;
she bounded towards the trap and descended&#xD;
it, pulling the heavy lid after her. She was for,&#xD;
a moment in darkness, but a light was visible&#xD;
in the distance, and she made towards it, and&#xD;
found that it came from a low window level with&#xD;
the ground. It wasopen, and in a moment she had&#xD;
effected a passage through it, and was flying like&#xD;
a hunted chamois over the old fields in the rear&#xD;
of the house. The old woman had taken some&#xD;
time to raise the trap and follow her ; and not&#xD;
being able to get through the narrow window,&#xD;
she had to return, re-as'eend to the upper room,&#xD;
and make her way out by the door. All this&#xD;
delay gave time and advantage to the lovely&#xD;
fugitive; but the speed at which the woman ran&#xD;
promised speedily to make up for the temporary&#xD;
delay. Kate kept on straight for the grove, and&#xD;
striking a path in it, followed it quite out of&#xD;
sight of Grasinere Hall, and by it was,,eonducted&#xD;
in a circuitous way to the river. The woman&#xD;
held on after her as long as she could, till at&#xD;
length she lost sight of her altogether, not but&#xD;
five minutes before she was fallen in with by&#xD;
our party of sailors, and taken prisoner and held&#xD;
hostage for the safety of the fugitive. Upon&#xD;
finding that she was no longer pursued, the fly-&#xD;
ing girl slackened her speed to get breath. She&#xD;
looked around-to see where she was, but could&#xD;
not, by the moonlight, recognize woodland&#xD;
scenery that she had beheld only once or twice&#xD;
before, and only by daylight.&#xD;
"I am   by the water side, however," she&#xD;
said ; "and I know if I follow the river long&#xD;
enough it will bring me home." She now&#xD;
heard a rustling, or thought she did, of the&#xD;
leaves behind her, and off she went again, as&#xD;
light of foot as a hare bounding over the heath-&#xD;
er. All at once, after she had run full half a&#xD;
mile, she came suddenly upon a boat that' was&#xD;
rowing down the river, and so closely to the&#xD;
bank, that by a bend of the shore she was brought&#xD;
within twenty feet of it, before she saw it. A&#xD;
glance told her it was a market-boat, and must&#xD;
have honest men on boardi. Her joy'at seeing&#xD;
&#xD;
it knew no bounds, and she was about to e ll to&#xD;
them to land and give her shelter and p, otection,&#xD;
when she was seen and bailed by a young man&#xD;
whom the reader will recognize to be the skip-&#xD;
per's son who had captured Tunstall ; for the&#xD;
barge is the same which contains the captive&#xD;
accomplice and pander to the .late Manfred&#xD;
Lawrence's vices.  On its way down the river&#xD;
they had reached that point. This young mad&#xD;
we have, hitherto merely alluded to incidentally ;&#xD;
but he is worthyto take a prominent place in&#xD;
our narrative-for . More generous, true-mind-&#xD;
ed, gallant fellow, for a plain farmer's son, than&#xD;
Paul Lovewell, never graced the pages of a&#xD;
romance. About. twenty three years of age,&#xD;
fairly educated for his position, naturally intel.&#xD;
ligent, he had a fine face, and an eye that ex-&#xD;
pressed both courage and kindness. le would&#xD;
be the inheritor of an independent farm on the&#xD;
death of his father ; and he lived upon and used&#xD;
the estate now -pretty much by his father's&#xD;
consent as his own. He owned, besides, two&#xD;
vessels, in which he used to convey his own pro-&#xD;
duce to the market of the metropolis ; and alto.&#xD;
gether, there was not, it was universally con-&#xD;
ceded, a more promising match for a sensible,&#xD;
nice girl, in all the country round than the&#xD;
handsome Paul Lovewell. But Paul's heart&#xD;
was not for any of the lasses who sought it&#xD;
boldly. He had, however, lost it, and to a&#xD;
maiden. whose name he did not even know. It&#xD;
happened on this wise. About two months&#xD;
prior to this time, when we introduce him&#xD;
hailing the shore .to ascertain who it was wan-&#xD;
dering there on the banks atthis late hour, he&#xD;
had been becalmed opposite the widow's cottage,&#xD;
so that from the deck of his barge he could see&#xD;
directly in the open door of the cottage. The&#xD;
picture of content and peace, and affectionate&#xD;
endearment, between mother and daughter, as&#xD;
he guessed they were, pleased him. Kate soon&#xD;
commenced singing, unconscious that the boat&#xD;
was there, for the foliage of the banks partly&#xD;
hid its presence. Her voice thrilled his soul,&#xD;
and awakened emotions that he had never known&#xD;
before,; though he had heard a, round score o&#xD;
young ladiess sing before' without any such sea-&#xD;

&#xD;
nations as he now experienced. A breeze at this&#xD;
moment springing up, he was wafted from the&#xD;
spot, but he carried with him the sweet echoes&#xD;
of Ler voice, which seemed to play at bo-peep&#xD;
in his heart all that night. From that time he&#xD;
never passed the cottage that he did not Teel a&#xD;
desire to come to and go in and make the&#xD;
acquaintance of the lovely girl, whom every&#xD;
week, as he went down or up, he saw seated in&#xD;
the door, braiding straw, or at the window, wat-&#xD;
ering plants, or in the garden, trimming them,-&#xD;
or by the water side, bending Aver to fill her&#xD;
pail. Always on these oceAns, he gazed with&#xD;
the most ardent interest in her, and as he thought,&#xD;
she more than once, in looking towards him as&#xD;
he sailed past, seemed aware of his particular&#xD;
admiration. At length fortune favored him be-'&#xD;
yond his hopes. About a week before we have&#xD;
introduced him to the reader, he was passing&#xD;
the cottage on his way to Boston, under full&#xD;
sail, when he was delighted to see her coming&#xD;
down to the river side to fill her pail. The&#xD;
grace and symmetry of her air and movements&#xD;
filled his eye with sweet rapture, while the&#xD;
blooming beauty of her face captivated his&#xD;
senses. As she bent over to dip her pail in, it&#xD;
escaped from her hand, and went swimming&#xD;
down the current. " 0, my pail!" she ex-&#xD;
claimed, clasping her hands in pretty despair,&#xD;
and glancing unconsciously towards the barge.&#xD;
"You wont lose it, I will get it for you,"&#xD;
answered Paul, delighted to have such an op-&#xD;
portunity of speaking to her, and opening his&#xD;
acquaintance with her, by doing her a favor.&#xD;
Putting his helm up, he ran in towards the&#xD;
shore, and darting past the pail, he caught it&#xD;
by the handle, and took it on board. He then&#xD;
steered his vessel along side of a rock that jut-&#xD;
ted- out from the bank, and bidding his nephew,&#xD;
the lad we have already introduced to the read-&#xD;
er, keep her steady, he leaped on shore, and&#xD;
'with native politeness, handed the bucket to1&#xD;
Kate, blushing like a peony at the idea of&#xD;
speaking, face to face, with the beautiful girl&#xD;
who had so long held possession of the throng&#xD;
of his heart. Kate thanked him with grace,,&#xD;
and told him she was sorry she had to put him&#xD;
&#xD;
to so much trouble. To this he replied that it&#xD;
was a pleasure to him, that it gave him an op-&#xD;
portunity of becoming acquainted with her, that&#xD;
he had often seen her as he passed, and heard&#xD;
her sing, and wished to know her, but feared&#xD;
that he would never have that happiness. He,.&#xD;
therefore, considered himself peculiarly fortu-&#xD;
nate in passing at the moment the bucket was&#xD;
lost.&#xD;
To this very handsome and frank speech,&#xD;
Kate blushingly replied that she was very glad&#xD;
to know him, and she then asked him in.&#xD;
"I will not go in now," he said, "but I will&#xD;
call some time, with your permission."&#xD;
"I shall always be glad to see you. You&#xD;
did not tell me your name.",&#xD;
"It is Paul Lovewell."&#xD;
"Are you the cousin to Mary Lovewell who&#xD;
lives at Brookline ?"&#xD;
"Yes. Do you know her ?"&#xD;
"I was at school with her last year. I have&#xD;
heard her speak of you," she added, looking in&#xD;
his face, as if she was gratified at the meeting ;&#xD;
for she saw, with a woman's eye, that the young&#xD;
man was greatly pleased with her. This is one&#xD;
of the first secrets a maiden learns. Love can&#xD;
never disguise itself. Lovers read each other's&#xD;
hearts like open books.&#xD;
This interview ended by Paul's filling the&#xD;
pail and taking it to the door of the cottage,&#xD;
where Kate introduced him to her mother, who&#xD;
had witnessed all that had taken place between&#xD;
them. She deepened Paul's satisfaction by&#xD;
saying she knew his mother well when they&#xD;
were young. and 'that she had heard that his&#xD;
father was one of the most upright and well-to--&#xD;
do men in the neighborhood. Paul hereupon&#xD;
felt almost like being among friends; and he&#xD;
left them and re-embarked, blessing the water&#xD;
pail for the occasion it had afforded him of&#xD;
speaking with the lovely girl who had so capti-&#xD;
vated his heart.&#xD;
Paul had not yet called again at the cottage&#xD;
when we now find him descending the river with&#xD;
Tunstall his prisoner.&#xD;
" Who is that ?" he now called from the stern&#xD;
of his boat, as the figure of Kate was seen in&#xD;
&#xD;
the moonlight. His voice was abrupt and im-&#xD;
perative, for the recent tragedy had put him&#xD;
upon the alert at every sign of skulking along&#xD;
the shore ; for he apprehended that there might&#xD;
be an attempt made to rescue his prisoner.&#xD;
"Are you country-people going to market'?"&#xD;
asked Kate, who was alarmed by the stern&#xD;
challenge.&#xD;
" Yes.  (It is a woman, father I")&#xD;
"0, then, land, and take me on board?  I&#xD;
am in great danger'?" she cried.&#xD;
"'That is her voice !" exclaimed Paul, with&#xD;
his heart in his mouth; and as he was at the&#xD;
helm, he rounded the vessel to, and drove her&#xD;
bows dead on to the shore. The next moment&#xD;
he was upon the land, and by the moon's rays&#xD;
fully recognized her, pale as she was, and dis-&#xD;
hevelled as her hair was, torn as her dress was.&#xD;
What is the danger you fear?   How came&#xD;
you here'?  Who would harm you ?  I will de-&#xD;
fend you with my life 1"&#xD;
"fIs it you, Paul?" she now almost shriek-&#xD;
ed with joy, as she recognized him, and threw&#xD;
herself almost upon his breast, in her joy at&#xD;
finding shelter and safety ; for she felt that he&#xD;
would and could protect her.&#xD;
"Yes, it is me ! Come on board, and I will&#xD;
protect you, and see you home," he said, with&#xD;
amazement at her excitement, and at finding&#xD;
her at midnight in such a situation, full four&#xD;
miles from her mother's house.&#xD;
She did not require a second request to go on&#xD;
board, for every moment she expected to see&#xD;
her pursuer behind her. Trembling like a leaf,&#xD;
she seated herself by him- on the deck, for he&#xD;
would not leave her side, or release her hand,&#xD;
to which she nervously clung, as if she feared&#xD;
that her safety might prove only a dream. He&#xD;
bent over her and tried to soothe her with manlyI&#xD;
words-; while his gray-haired father once more&#xD;
put their vessel on her course, and steered her&#xD;
down the stream.&#xD;
"I will tell you briefly," at length!said Kate,&#xD;
after she found that she was in no danger of1&#xD;
pursuit or re-capture, " what needs explanation.&#xD;
I have been forcibly carried awy from my&#xD;
mother's house, to-night, and succeeded in ef-&#xD;
&#xD;
fecting my escape from my captors, and was&#xD;
wandering in the woods when your boat&#xD;
appeared."&#xD;
" Who were they that did this ?" demanded&#xD;
Paul, with flashing eyes.&#xD;
"I do not know them ; but they were hi -ed&#xD;
by Manfred Lawrence."&#xD;
" And he is murdered !"&#xD;
"He murdered !" exclaimed Kate, between&#xD;
horror and an indefinable sense of relief, both&#xD;
of which ideas came into her mind at the same&#xD;
instant.&#xD;
" Yes ; he was slain to-night, and robbed&#xD;
afterwards, by a man by the name of Tunstall."&#xD;
"That is the name I"&#xD;
"What name ?"&#xD;
"The name they called the man who took&#xD;
me in the carriage. He left me in a lonely&#xD;

whom I escaped."&#xD;
"Tunstall is on board here, bound, and lock-&#xD;
ed up in the fore cuddy," said Paul. "It is&#xD;
bad for him that I have-him in my power, now I&#xD;
know what more he has done."&#xD;
We will not here recapitulate the conversation&#xD;
that now took place between Paul and Catha-&#xD;
rine, as he related to her the particulars of Tun-&#xD;
stall's arrest. After this subject was ended,&#xD;
his thoughts ran into a tender channel, and he&#xD;
began to breathe into her ear words of gentle&#xD;
passion, which the maiden's ears did not unwil-&#xD;
lingly listen to. She was grateful to him for&#xD;
her present security ; she had thought a great&#xD;
deal of him ever since the affair of the pail,&#xD;
and if he half loved her now, she loved the'&#xD;
other half, and their hearts met on the same&#xD;
ground. When at length the boat came opposite&#xD;
the cottage, they were both, to tell the truth, a&#xD;
little sorry that the cottage was not a mile fur-&#xD;
ther down the river.&#xD;
- As they sailed in to land, Edward and the&#xD;
widow were recognized on the bank,, watching,&#xD;
having heard 'the boat. He had not long'&#xD;
before been 'roused from the stupor of grief -&#xD;

cribe the re-union of mother and daughter ?s&#xD;
and who shall portray the widow's gratitude tot&#xD;
Paul Lovewell?  She embraced him   as if hec&#xD;
had been her own son, and ,with tears of joy,&#xD;
called on Heaven to bless and reward him for&#xD;
having brought her daughter back to her bosomt&#xD;
in safety.  Edward, who recognized Paul as an&#xD;
acquaintance, shook him warmly by the hand ;&#xD;
and old Mr. Lovewell, and the grandson, Lot,&#xD;
came in for their share of thanks.  All at once,&#xD;
Paul taking Edward aside, said :&#xD;
"Will you tell me the name of this beautiful&#xD;
girl?&#xD;
"Don't you know?    It is Catharine Wyn-&#xD;
yard."&#xD;
"It shall be written on my heart. Mr.&#xD;
Blackloek."&#xD;
"What, do you love her?"&#xD;
"With all my soul. I have seen her several&#xD;
times, and long loved her ; but to-night I be-&#xD;
lieve she will return my love."&#xD;
"I am glad to hear it. You are worthy of&#xD;
each other. She is the best girl in the land."&#xD;
"I know it. Iknow it. And the mother ?"&#xD;
"There can be no objections to you, Paul.&#xD;
Do you know that I have had you in my mind,&#xD;
thinking over who she ought to marry, and&#xD;
wished you were acquainted. She and her&#xD;
mother are my friends, and I feel an interest in&#xD;
seeing her well settled, for her own peace and&#xD;
happiness."&#xD;
"I am glad you have so high an opinion of&#xD;
me," answered Paul. "But do you know that&#xD;
Manfred Lawrence has. been murdered ? His&#xD;
body was found, and--What has he seen that&#xD;
has made him run towards 'the woodland so?"&#xD;
Before Paul could answer his own inquiry at&#xD;
the abrupt departure of poor Edward, on hear-&#xD;
ing this death thus spoken of, the old man hail-&#xD;
ed him, saying that they must make sail; for&#xD;
they had delayed so often, they would hardly&#xD;
reacBoston in time for the market.. In a few&#xD;
minutes the-barge was'once more under nanvass,&#xD;
movingion her course down the river.. When&#xD;
Kate sawit disappear, she felt strangely lonely,&#xD;
as if her only earthly support had gone. That&#xD;
Paul carried her heart away,-that heart which&#xD;
&#xD;
rNYARD.,&#xD;
&#xD;
she believed could beat only for Edward,-.&#xD;
there was no question. If Edward had return-&#xD;
ed her tender regard, she would never have had&#xD;
room for another's image ; but love that is all&#xD;
on one side will soon wither, and a new love,&#xD;
that meets requital, will efface all traces of the&#xD;
old. This is human nature.&#xD;
Edward had walked away from Paul to con-&#xD;
ceal his emotion at the sudden allusion to Law-&#xD;
rence's death.  " Surely," said he "this thing&#xD;
is known everywhere ! 'Whither shall I fly ?"&#xD;
" And why do you wish to fly ?" asked a&#xD;
voice near him.&#xD;
It was the captain, who had got thus far on&#xD;
his search.&#xD;
"She is safe, and in the house," answered&#xD;
Edward, quickly.&#xD;
" That's noble news, Master Blacklock. Did&#xD;
she come on foot all the way, poor thing ?"&#xD;
" No. Paul Lovewell took her on board his&#xD;
barge, four miles up the river, and brought her&#xD;
home."&#xD;
" Paul shall be my best friend for this. How&#xD;
does she seem? But I will go and kiss her, and&#xD;
see for myself. Come in !"&#xD;
" No-I will remain here. Come out after a&#xD;
few moments, for I have something to say to&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
Captain Wat having embraced his sister, and&#xD;
heard from her briefly an account of her adven-&#xD;
tures, the recital of which he interrupted with&#xD;
many an oath, he then asked his mother what&#xD;
was the matter with Edward Blacklock.   " I&#xD;
met him walking beyond the garden, and talk-&#xD;
ing to himself, and he seems to have something&#xD;
heavy on his mind. -But it is perhaps 'that he&#xD;
buried his father so lately. I will go and see'&#xD;
him. This is no time-for, gloom, now our lost&#xD;
lamb has come home."&#xD;
He went out and found Edward waiting for&#xD;
him. He took the captain aside, and then&#xD;
opening his heart to him, made known to him all&#xD;
that he had done.  When'he had ended, he&#xD;
stood silently, with his arms folded, awaiting the&#xD;
answer of the flatter to this inquiry:&#xD;
" What do you adviseme to do? for I am too&#xD;
much agitated to act or judge for myself."&#xD;

when the affair is blown over, you can return.  "He is a fine young man, Edward says. You&#xD;

name. It is English."&#xD;
S"Yes."&#xD;
"I was.five years at school in England, when&#xD;
I was a boy; and I am quite sure that name&#xD;
was heard, or seen, or read by me. But it is&#xD;
like an escaped dream. I. should not be sur-&#xD;
prised if you were Jnglish."&#xD;
" It may be so."&#xD;
"If I were you, I would go from Cadiz to&#xD;
England, and see who owns this 'name. By&#xD;
persevering research, you may ascertain the se-&#xD;
cret of your parentage."  Edward was thought-&#xD;
ful, but made-no reply.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Have you been in lurope ?" asked the&#xD;
stranger.&#xD;
"Never," answered Edward, trying to rouse&#xD;
himself. Caplain Wat now came up, and said:&#xD;
"Mr. Blacklock, this is the Count del Portello,&#xD;
embassador from Portugal. I brought him over,&#xD;
and he returns with me."  The two young men&#xD;
bowed; and the lively wit of the count, his&#xD;
fund of anecdote, his acute observations upon&#xD;
men and things, his inexhaustible flow of spirits,&#xD;
soon drew Edward out from the gloomy depth&#xD;
of his thoughts.&#xD;
During the voyage they became as intimate&#xD;
as brothers, and each had told 'the other the&#xD;
history of their lives. The count took a worldly&#xD;
view of Edward's agency in Lawrence's death,&#xD;
and almost reconciled him to it ; but his heart&#xD;
continued sad on account of what he felt must&#xD;
be the constant suffering of Isabel.&#xD;
"That will pass, my dear Edward," said the&#xD;
count, gaily, the day they came in sight of the&#xD;
shores of Portugal. 4"You  will, by-and-by,&#xD;
return, and you will be married and happy.&#xD;
But what dwells most on my mind, is the strange&#xD;
mystery of your early life. Have you no clew&#xD;
whatever,?"&#xD;
''Only the name upon the chest."&#xD;
"And you did not tell me that."&#xD;
"It is here. I copied it the day of my&#xD;
father's death." Edward then placed in his&#xD;
hand a slip of paper which he took from  his&#xD;
pocket-book.&#xD;
" CLIFFORD ST. CLAIR," repeated the count,&#xD;
slowly. "It seems to me I have heard that&#xD;
&#xD;

Fy&#xD;
J.&#xD;
";q&#xD;
ti&#xD;
&#xD;
The next day they reached Cadiz, and the&#xD;
count landed and invited Edward to go on shore&#xD;
with him. He found that he was in the confi-&#xD;
dence of the count, and greatly esteemed, and&#xD;
felt honored by his friendship. For several&#xD;
days, in the noble pleasures of the court, to&#xD;
which the count presented him, he enjoyed him-&#xD;
self, and grew less and less despondent; nay,&#xD;
became gay and cheerful, and much like his&#xD;
former self. But in his lonely hours, he sor-&#xD;
rowed for Isabel's wretchedness, in her lose love&#xD;
for him.&#xD;
One day, after he had been three weeks in&#xD;
Lisbon, and two weeks in Cadiz, the captain,&#xD;
whose vessel lay in the latter port, told him that&#xD;
he was going on a cruise, and that if he would&#xD;
accompany him, he should share in the profits&#xD;
of the expedition.&#xD;
"You say, my dear Mr. Blacklock," he re-&#xD;
marked to him, " that you are strongly impress-&#xD;
ed with a desire to visit England. I agree with&#xD;
the count that your name is English ; and as&#xD;
your parents have never turned up in America,&#xD;
I shouldn't be at all surprised if you should&#xD;
hear of them in the old country, Now, you&#xD;
must have funds. You were too proud the&#xD;
other day to accept any from me, when the gov-&#xD;
ernment paid me the four thousand dollars I got&#xD;
for my trip across to Boston."&#xD;
" You can't expect me to be a dependent on&#xD;
your bounty, my dear Captain Walter. I owe&#xD;
you a debt of gratitude already."&#xD;
" Well, if you won't have my money, I will&#xD;
give you a chance of making some for yourself,&#xD;
if you will go with me on this 'cruise."&#xD;
"Where are you bound ?"&#xD;
" That I will tell you, when we get off sound-&#xD;
ings. We shall be back here, with 'twenty&#xD;
thousand dollars, in ninety days, if all 'works&#xD;
well."&#xD;
" I will go with you. I suppose it is another&#xD;
conveyance of dispatches."&#xD;
" Thatis as it may turn out," answered&#xD;
Captain Wat, with a laugh.&#xD;
The week following, Edward enibarked inthe&#xD;
schooner, the name of which we have not given,&#xD;
for the very good reason. that it had no nMtne.&#xD;

&#xD;
Edward had never heard it called by any other&#xD;
appellation than the despatch vessel. The count,&#xD;
unable to prevail upon him to go with him to&#xD;
England-whither.he was going on a secret mis&#xD;
sion-because Edward would not suffer him to&#xD;
pay his expenses, nevertheless promised that in&#xD;
England he would make some inquiries about&#xD;
the St. Clairs. On the same day both departed&#xD;
from Cadiz, the count for England, in a British&#xD;
ship, and Edward southward, in the schooner.&#xD;
The latter vessel ran south for eight days,&#xD;
when one morning, as Edward came on deck,&#xD;
he saw that the coast of Africa lay to leeward,&#xD;
in an extended arid line of glittering sand and&#xD;
black rocks. The schooner was running straight&#xD;
in for the scarcely apparent mouth of a narrow&#xD;
river.&#xD;
"What place is this, we are approaching?"&#xD;
said Edward, who had been wondering for a&#xD;
day or two past why the captain kept on a south-&#xD;
ern course so steadily, day after day.&#xD;
"1That cape, a league to the south of us, is&#xD;
Cape Barbas, and the river is the Rio Cypriano,"&#xD;
answered the captain, coolly, smoking his cigar.&#xD;
"And we are to enter the river ?"&#xD;
"Yes, and sail up about nine miles."&#xD;
"Is there a town there ?"&#xD;
"No, only a barranca."&#xD;
"What is that?"&#xD;
"A   depot for Africans," quietly answered&#xD;
Captain Wat.&#xD;
"And what have we to do with the Africans&#xD;
Do you intend to trade with them ?"&#xD;
"Do you see any merchandise on board&#xD;
Master Blacklook ?" he answered, significantly&#xD;
"jTrue, you have only five or six boxes."&#xD;
"'And those contain handcuffs and manacles&#xD;
some three hundred plN."&#xD;
"And why do you take such things to---&#xD;
Is it possible," he suddenly exclaimed, as ligh&#xD;
washed upon him, " that you are going to en&#xD;
gage in the slave trade, Captain Walter ?"&#xD;
"     PNogoing to, for I am  already in it.&#xD;
have been pursuing it for four years past, an&#xD;
haditproiztable. hIab in the einploy of a rio&#xD;
hense-in Cadis, thathas abraneh in Rtio Janeiro&#xD;
in Brasil. The one furnishes me with fund&#xD;
&#xD;
and vessels, and the other receives and disposes&#xD;
of my cargoes. The way I happened to be sent&#xD;
to America, was this : My merchants in Cadiz&#xD;
were fitting me out with a new vessel-this&#xD;
same craft-and I was ready for sea, when the&#xD;
government required a fast sailor to take a bear-&#xD;
er of despatches to the United States, on some&#xD;
private business, of the nature of whichI am&#xD;
even now ignorant. So my vessel was offered.&#xD;
The owners received twelve thousand dollars,&#xD;
and I four, as my share. So you see I am now&#xD;
only returning to my old trade again."&#xD;
" If I had suspected that you-. But what&#xD;
can I say?  I am an outcast ! How can I pre-&#xD;
sume to dictate?  But I may state to you, cap-&#xD;
tain, in a friendly wfty, that I would never vol-&#xD;
untarily have placed myself in this situation.&#xD;
Had you told me at Cadiz, I should not have set&#xD;
foot on board your vessel. on a cruise such as&#xD;
this proves to be."&#xD;
"What would you have done?     You need&#xD;
the money you would not accept from me."&#xD;
"I can't share any made in this manner,&#xD;
captain."&#xD;
" Folly ! You must not haul off, now ! But&#xD;
I won't urge you. You shall just look on."&#xD;
" It is an infamous trade ; and I am amazed&#xD;
that you-for you have really noble qualities&#xD;
about you that I like-I am amazed that you&#xD;
I should be engaged in it."&#xD;
"To make money !   This is excuse enough,&#xD;
? in the world's eye, for any pursuit."&#xD;
"In the world's worst eye. But right-mind-&#xD;
ed men look upon the trade with just ab-&#xD;
horrence."&#xD;
"Because they know nothing about it. But&#xD;
, I must be on the lookout. Ahoy, there, aloft !&#xD;
Is the coast clear ?  Any sign of these British&#xD;
cruisers about ?"&#xD;
t    " Not a speck to be seen, sir, on the horizon,"&#xD;
- answered the lieutenant from the fore cross-trees,&#xD;
as he swept the horizon with his glass.&#xD;
I    " Ay, ay !  Now we will -ruan in, major, and&#xD;
d get our load on board by daylight, and be at&#xD;
b sea before noon."&#xD;
, This was said to the fat, second lieutenant,&#xD;
Is who, in his shirt sleeves,- Mas seated flat on the&#xD;
&#xD;
around the neck, and communicate by a bar of&#xD;
iron to a cross bar between the handcuffs ; thus&#xD;
rendering it impossible for the wearer to use his&#xD;
hands or turn his head. These, the captain&#xD;
said, were for the most refractory.  There were&#xD;
also instruments which the horrified Edward&#xD;
had to inquire the use of. Some were for gags,&#xD;
some were to fasten the feet to the hands, others&#xD;
to press onthe eyes to keep them shut.  These&#xD;
were all instruments, not of security, but o&#xD;
punishment.&#xD;
In the meanwhile the schooner was running&#xD;
in under the land, and, by-and-by, entered the&#xD;
mouth of the river, and with a free. breeze,&#xD;
swiftly ascended it. The banks were destitute&#xD;
of grass,. and were rocky and desolate. The&#xD;
river was winding and deep, and after six miles&#xD;
from the sea, a few clumps of bushes relieved&#xD;
the monotony of the arid scene. At length, in&#xD;
the distance, became visible a sort of walled enelo-&#xD;
sure of great extent, upon the top of which was&#xD;
flying a red flag, in answer to one which Cap.&#xD;
tain Wat had already hoisted at his foremast&#xD;
head. There was not a sign of human habita-&#xD;
tion or of a human being to be seen on either&#xD;
&#xD;
Captain Wat now got into the boat, and&#xD;
inviting Edward to follow him, pulled ashore,&#xD;
where he was met by the three men with the&#xD;
welcome  of an old   acquaintance. Edward&#xD;
thought he had never seen a trio of more true-&#xD;
ulent looking rogues than they were.  One of&#xD;
them was scarred across the face, and had lost&#xD;
three fingers of his left hand; another had a&#xD;
piece of his nose wanting, evidently sliced off&#xD;
by a sabre ; and the third was less an ear. One&#xD;
was English, another a Spaniard, and the third&#xD;
looked like a Jew, yet might have been a Por-&#xD;
tuguese. -They all spoke in the English tongue&#xD;
with more or less facility.&#xD;
.You have been away a long time, captain,"&#xD;
said the man with the three fingers wanting.&#xD;
"Yes-I have taken a trip to the States."&#xD;
"We were afraid you had abandoned the&#xD;
trade, you had such a narrow escape from the&#xD;
Iritish cruiser the last time," said the other.&#xD;
" How many black cattle have you in depot?"&#xD;
asked the captain ; " I am impatient to get in&#xD;
my cargo, arnd be. off while the coast in clear."&#xD;
" There has not been a cruiser on the, coast&#xD;

" So much the more need of my hurrying off,&#xD;

"Very well. Go in and make your selec-&#xD;
tion."  As they were walking together, the&#xD;
four men conversed together in Spanish upon-&#xD;
the news from Europe, and other matters per-&#xD;
sonal to, themselves. Particular inquiries were&#xD;
put to the captain about Edward, which the&#xD;
former answered by saying that he was a shore&#xD;
friend of his, voyaging for his health, and to see&#xD;
the world, having killed a man, which rendered&#xD;
his absence from his native country for a time&#xD;
necessary.&#xD;
Edward noticed that the half-dressed negroes&#xD;
whom he saw run from the huts to the landing,&#xD;
stood off at a little distance, as if.waiting to obey&#xD;
some 'orders' which they expected to receive.&#xD;
Each'if them was armed with a terrible whip,&#xD;
which they flourished and cracked'in the air in&#xD;
great glee, uttering all the while the most sav-&#xD;
agejells, 'accompanied by demoniac contor-tions&#xD;
&#xD;
of their visages. They followed the party of&#xD;
men quite to the, gate, on each side of which&#xD;
they ranged themselves.&#xD;
When Edward passed through the gate, and&#xD;
found himself within the walls of the temporary&#xD;
prison of the Africans that await transportation,&#xD;
he stopped, overwhelmed with amazement, at&#xD;
the extraordinary spectacle which there present-&#xD;
ed itself to him.  Upwards of nine hundred&#xD;
wild negroes, perfectly naked, their skins horri-&#xD;
bly tattooed, were congregated in the enclosure,&#xD;
in every imaginable posture. Some were lying&#xD;
down alseep, some were sitting on their haunches,&#xD;
rocking to and fro, and chaunting like witches,&#xD;
some were wrestling, some were fighting, some&#xD;
were running, some eating, and some sick and&#xD;
dying-and two, a woman and her child, lay&#xD;
dead and disregarded. The sounds that filled&#xD;
this pound of human cattle, were indescribable.&#xD;
At the entrance of the party, a gong was struck&#xD;
by a white man, who, with some six or seven&#xD;
others, formed a guard over them, and at the&#xD;
sound there was a universal stillness. The&#xD;
guards then shouted to the negroes to fall into&#xD;
ranks ; and after about a quarter of an hour,&#xD;
they surrounded the area, five deep, and stood&#xD;
waiting in mortal fear. They well knew that&#xD;
the hour had come to send them over the dread-&#xD;
ful sea, and tear them from each other and their&#xD;
country forever.-&#xD;
The captain then walked around the circle,&#xD;
and as he went, made his selection... The three&#xD;
men followed him, one of them bringing a pot&#xD;
of red paint, with which he numbered them on&#xD;
the back, as they were picked out.  There was&#xD;
no preference given to any natural ties--health&#xD;
and sinews were alone 'regarded. Fathers and&#xD;
children, brothers and sisters, wives and hus-&#xD;
bands, were separated without mercy.&#xD;
"0, mark me !" shrieked a girl of sixteen,&#xD;
as her twin brother received the red sign of&#xD;
bondage between his shoulders ; but she looked&#xD;
sickly, and was passed by, notwithstanding her&#xD;
imploring cries, which' were silenced by the&#xD;
whip of one of ,the guards. It would be im-&#xD;
possible to portray the scenes of wretchedness,&#xD;
despair and woe that met Edward's appalled&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
ears and eyes. The laments of kindred parted&#xD;
from kindred, penetrated his very soul. He&#xD;
would have pleaded for them, but felt that mer-&#xD;
cy was a word unknown to those men of the&#xD;
barranca. He regarded Captain Wat Wynyard&#xD;
with amazement and horror, as he passed round&#xD;
the circles his presence filled with so much&#xD;
misery, perfectly unconcerned. At length,&#xD;
after three hours given to the. task, he had se-&#xD;
lected the three hundred and fifty, and number-&#xD;
ed them. They were now pinioned, two and&#xD;
two, driven out in a long file from. the enclosure,&#xD;
led by the Englishman, who went in advance,&#xD;
carrying a pistol in 'each hand, ready to shoot&#xD;
the first one that broke from the line. Edward&#xD;
now saw the office of the half-civilized blacks&#xD;
with the whips. Their duty was to station&#xD;
themselves along the line, ten feet distant from&#xD;
each other, and quicken the steps of the lag-&#xD;
gards with the bleeding strokes of the lash ; an&#xD;
occupation which appeared to delight their sav-&#xD;
age hearts.&#xD;
When the last pair of little children that&#xD;
brought up the rear, had left the gate, and it&#xD;
was, again shut, there broke upon the air a cry&#xD;
wrung from the mothers, and fathers, and&#xD;
brothers,- and sisters, and wives, and hus.&#xD;
bands, and sons, and daughters, from whom&#xD;
those they most loved had been torn so ruth-&#xD;
lessly.&#xD;
" That cry went up to God !" said Edward&#xD;
to himself, with indignant feeling. "0, how&#xD;
can the sun shine so brightly on such a scene as&#xD;
this -"&#xD;
The cry, which was a mingled moan and&#xD;
shriek fiom five hundred voices, was responded&#xD;
to by a wail of total despair from the procession&#xD;
of captives without. They sent up a unanimous&#xD;
and heart-rending answering groan, that would&#xD;
have, moved devils to pity theni.&#xD;
But we draw a veil over the painful picture&#xD;
of human wickedness, for the reality is daily&#xD;
going on; and while I write, the voice of the&#xD;
stolen sons of Afic, like the voice of murdered&#xD;
Abel, is crying unto God, from the shores of&#xD;
Africa, "0, God, how long!1 0, God, how&#xD;
long!"&#xD;
&#xD;
The embarkation was effected by means of&#xD;
seven boats, paddled by the half-dressed blacks,&#xD;
which belonged to the barranca, and whibh&#xD;
were kept for this-purpose. It was dark when&#xD;
the last pair was taken on board ; and as nine&#xD;
of them were drowned-four of them by leapI&#xD;
overboard, preferring death to slavery-there&#xD;
were but three hundred and forty one placed'on&#xD;
board. As they crossed the gangway, they&#xD;
were conducted down into thehold, and led aft,&#xD;
where they were made to sit down, for the&#xD;
place was not more than four feet high. When&#xD;
the hold was completely surrounded by one tier,&#xD;
then another tier was placed in front, seated&#xD;
partly between the feet of those behind. In&#xD;
this way the adults were seated, and ocd ea&#xD;
all the room; while the children, from twelve&#xD;
years old to eight,-,for they took none younger,&#xD;
--were stowed in the arms or upon the legs of&#xD;
the rest. By this economical mode of stowage,&#xD;
three hundred and forty human beings were&#xD;
skilfully made to occupy a space that would&#xD;
have been narrow accommodations for twenty-&#xD;
five persons.&#xD;
At length, the hold being full, and the necessw&#xD;
ry forms of signing papers havingbeen gone&#xD;
through, Captain Walter-.-whom Edward look;&#xD;
en upon now with horror, recollecting all 1i '&#xD;
first impressions about him-took leave of ht&#xD;
co-partners in iniquity ; and, weighing anchor&#xD;
he hoisted sail, and, as the late moon was rising&#xD;
about eleven o'clock at night, he left the howl=&#xD;
ing barranca astern, and rapidly descended tlfb&#xD;
river Cyprian towards the 'sea. tAs they were&#xD;
losing sight of the place] a loud noise reached&#xD;
their ears, coming from  the south, across the"&#xD;
desert. It sounded like the march of a ba-&#xD;
barie army, with rude warlike instruments.&#xD;
"Do you hear that ?" asked the captain.&#xD;
" What can it mean '" demnded Edward.&#xD;
with surprise.&#xD;
" It is a new batch of the black cattle, coming&#xD;
in from the interior. It is well I took off my&#xD;
load to make room for them. I never knew the&#xD;
barranca so full."&#xD;
" What do you mean by a new batch 2"&#xD;
" Of prisoners. You see the traders keep up&#xD;

&#xD;
the supply by means of wars between the tribes. a&#xD;
They first manage to get them  at loggerheads, t&#xD;
and then offer so much a head for the prisoners&#xD;
they take. There are at least fifty tribes now iI&#xD;
at constant war with each other, for nothing but&#xD;
to take prisoners and sell them at the barranca. i&#xD;
When they get a hundred or more, they march&#xD;
them down and sell them to us. That is a lot y&#xD;
now approaching; and ten to one, in six months,&#xD;
another tribe will be bringing down the very t&#xD;
same black rascals, as slaves, who are now f&#xD;
bringing the gang that is coming. There they&#xD;
go!  You see the long black line moving, a mile&#xD;
off?"&#xD;
"Yes, I see it !" answered Edward, who 1&#xD;
nowelt that the African slave trade was more&#xD;
monstrous than he bad believed. Gladly would!&#xD;
Edward Blacklock have quitted the schooner at&#xD;
the barranca, now that th'e real character of&#xD;
Captain Wat Wynyard, and the nature of his&#xD;
"seafaring " pursuits, were clearly revealed to&#xD;
him.  But it would only have been changing&#xD;
for the worse, to remain with the slave-factors;&#xD;
and to wander away from it would be certain&#xD;
destruction. The only thing he could do,&#xD;
therefore, was to remain in the schooner unti&#xD;
she reached some civilized port, and there leave&#xD;
her and her unprincipled captain forever. In&#xD;
the meanwhile, he felt the expediency of keep&#xD;
ing perfectly quiet touching his own views of&#xD;
the occupation by which the captain was enrich-&#xD;
ing himself; for he felt no disposition to run&#xD;
te risk of incurring the suspicion or dislike of&#xD;
- man whom he now had ample evidence was&#xD;
qne of the.most reckless men ever engaged in&#xD;
this revoltingtrade.&#xD;
At length, as the sun rose, the schooner gain.&#xD;
ed the open sea, and.the captain laid her course&#xD;
for Rio Janeiro.,&#xD;
" Do you dispose of this cargo in that city ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
asked Edward, with difficulty suffering himself&#xD;
o converse with the reckless young man.&#xD;
"Yes. That is a fine market. We run in&#xD;
n open day, and dispose of them in the market.&#xD;
Al we have to fear is from cruisers before we get&#xD;
n.,,&#xD;
"And suppose a cruiser should capture&#xD;
you?2"&#xD;
"I should lose my cargo and vessel, and be&#xD;
aken to England or America, according to the&#xD;
lag, and be tried for my life!"&#xD;
"It is a dangerous trade."&#xD;
"But a profitable one. This cargo cost the&#xD;
factors at the barranca about fifteen dollars a&#xD;
head. I shall get, in Rio, one hundred and&#xD;
thirty all round. But we shall lose fifty on the&#xD;
passage by death-that is the average. They&#xD;
will be the weakest of the, lot that die, and&#xD;
wouldn't be worth much to us if we got them to&#xD;
Rio. That is the reason why we take fifty over&#xD;
our actual easy stowage, so that we may kill off&#xD;
the weaker ones, by the crowding and privation,&#xD;
and have left only the sound ones. We consid-&#xD;
er a negro that can pass through the voyage, as&#xD;
healthy and strong, and of good service."&#xD;
Edward made no reply.&#xD;
The voyage lasted nineteen days. Every&#xD;
morning, regularly, the hold was opened, and&#xD;
Edward's ears were greeted by the harsh voice&#xD;
of the lieutenant, crying out :  .&#xD;
"Bring up the dead !"&#xD;
These were passed out over the heads of. the&#xD;
rest, and thrown into the sea to the waiting&#xD;
sharks, which follow slavers in great numbers,&#xD;
night and day, across the ocean. Every morn-&#xD;
ing, from two to five were brought up dead, and&#xD;
cast to these monsters. At length the blue&#xD;
mountains the enclose Rio-Janeiro hove in sight,&#xD;
and preparations were made to land that night,&#xD;
for fear any crusier might be hovering off the port.&#xD;

IIE  afternoon was drawing. to a close&#xD;
.hen the slave trader run under the&#xD;
shadow of the lofty sugar-loaf mount that tow-&#xD;
ers cloudward near Rio. The vessels in port&#xD;
were seen, ana Me tools and towers of the im-&#xD;
perial city.&#xD;
"We will lay by here till after dark,. and then&#xD;
run in," said Captain Wat.    *9By midnight&#xD;
we will have all our cargo landed, and then we&#xD;
can anchor, if I please, right ender the guns of&#xD;
an English seventy-four."&#xD;
After dark, sail was made on the schooner,&#xD;
and under the influence of a steady wind from&#xD;
the south ann east, she ran into the harbor.&#xD;
" Sail dead ahead !" called out the lookout&#xD;
from the bows.&#xD;
"Luff and give her a wider berth," com-&#xD;
manded the captain, in a quick, startling tone.&#xD;
The schooner drew close to the wind, but the&#xD;
advancing vessel seemed to intend to meet her,&#xD;
for it imitated her motions. As the stranger&#xD;
drew nearer, the captain uttered a terrible oath,&#xD;
and seizing the helm, put it hard down, and&#xD;
calling out to cast off tack and sheet, laid his&#xD;
vessel right before the wind, and began to run&#xD;
for it ; for he had made her out with the night&#xD;
lens in his spy-glass, to be a large frigate of at&#xD;
least sixty guns.&#xD;
"That fellow," said the lieutenant of the&#xD;
Wateh on the quarter deck of the stranger--whichI&#xD;
&#xD;
was a British frigate of the largest class bound&#xD;
to lEgland-.-" seems to be taking a deuced deal&#xD;
of trouble to get out of our way."&#xD;
" Yes," answered the quarter-master, and I&#xD;
will bet a month's pay he is a slaver trying to&#xD;
run in under cover of the darkness.  He is as&#xD;
rakish as a, buccanier."&#xD;
Three or fou glasses were now levelled At&#xD;
the schooner as she run across the fore-foot of&#xD;
the frigate, about half a mile off, to get into&#xD;
shoal water toleeward.&#xD;
"She is running away," said the quarter-&#xD;
master.&#xD;
" Seton, ' said the lieutenant of the deck,&#xD;
addressing a midshipman, "report to Lord&#xD;
Clifford that a suspicious vessel is making sail&#xD;
away from us."&#xD;
The nobleman, who commanded the frigate&#xD;
now came on deck, and having learned how she&#xD;
had manouvred, he ordered a gun to be fired to&#xD;
bring her to.&#xD;
"We are caught in a net, B1lacklock," said&#xD;
Wynyard, speaking through his clenched teeth',,&#xD;
as the report of the gun rolled to leeward.  "I&#xD;
will let them sink me before I heave to. If&#xD;
can keep clear of their iron for twenty minutes,f&#xD;
I shall get to the leeward of the island, where&#xD;
they can't follow me,",&#xD;
. Edward watched for, the next shot from the&#xD;
frigate with deep interest. Rib own fate was&#xD;

&#xD;
now at issue. He was likely either to be killed&#xD;
by the cannon balls of the English, or, if taken&#xD;
with the vessel, to be hanged as a slaver. In&#xD;
the meanwhile Wynyard was using every means,&#xD;
to increase the velocity of his vessel. First he&#xD;
cast overboard two of the guns, he then cut&#xD;
away the bulwarks, and rolled the other four&#xD;
into the sea. A third shot from the frigate&#xD;
whizzed close above his deck, and brought from&#xD;
his exasperated spirit a volley of oaths.&#xD;
" Turn up the black cattle ! Turn them up,&#xD;
and overboard with them," he called to his&#xD;
men.&#xD;
"You are not in earnest ?" interposed the&#xD;
horror-stricken Edward.&#xD;
"In earnest'? Don't speak to me, sir ! I&#xD;
am in earnest. My vessel musthe lightened, and&#xD;
if she is at last taken, they shall not find an ac-&#xD;
cursed black carcase from stem to stern to con-&#xD;
demn me. Up with them and prick them over-&#xD;
board with your pikes-lively, men, lively."&#xD;
The negroes, always glad - to be called on&#xD;
deck--which they were in twenties during the&#xD;
days of the voyage, to breathe the air for an&#xD;
hour at a.time-now hurried up at the order of&#xD;
the major, who, if possible, was more of a fiend&#xD;
than his captain.&#xD;
As fast as they came up, they were at once&#xD;
pressed to the vessel's side with the sharp pike.&#xD;
heads, and with piercing shrieks, they plunged&#xD;
into the water., Edward sprang forward to&#xD;
their rescue, resolved to prevent this manoeuvre.&#xD;
But scarcely had the first manacled pair of&#xD;
wretches been driven overboard, in spite of his&#xD;
interposition and risk of his own life, than with&#xD;
a loud grinding shock, the schooner struck up-&#xD;
on a shoal all standing, and broke her foremast&#xD;
short off at the head. The schooner at the&#xD;
same time keeled with a deep lift to starboard.&#xD;
The Africans in the hold, apprehending instant&#xD;
death, uttered the most appalling cries.  Cap.&#xD;
tam Wynyard, finding that his vessel waslost,&#xD;
now called for the boats to be lowered, while he&#xD;
himself assisted at the davits, and threw in the&#xD;
Oars.&#xD;
In the meanwhile, the shrieks of the slaves&#xD;
feaohing the ears of those on board the frig&#xD;
&#xD;
ate, the true character of the chase was under-&#xD;
stood.&#xD;
"Fire no more guns ! She is ashore ! but&#xD;
down with the boats, man them and board her,"&#xD;
called out the Port Captain in command. "She&#xD;
is a slaver ! Let every boat but one leave the&#xD;
ship, and only six men with the cockswain in&#xD;
each, for there must be room to take the slaves&#xD;
on board, if the schooner is filling, as is likely."&#xD;
In five minutes, seven boats were pulling&#xD;
from the frigate, which came to, within a quar-&#xD;
ter of a mile of the schooner, and as near as&#xD;
her lead told her sailing-master she ought to&#xD;
approach. The leading boat contained twenty&#xD;
men, armed with pistols and cutlasses, to board&#xD;
the slaver and do thb fighting in capturing her,&#xD;
while the other boats were to take off the&#xD;
slaves.&#xD;
Captain Wat saw the fleet of boats advancing&#xD;
before he had got his own boat afloat. As he&#xD;
was about to jump in, many of the Africans&#xD;
crowded over the side and leaped into it, till&#xD;
was it filled and sunk. But the water was not&#xD;
more than five feet deep alongside, and they&#xD;
made their way to the bar, by swimming or wad-&#xD;
ing. The whole scene was now one of the&#xD;
fiercest confusion. The larger African men, in&#xD;
their fury, seeing that all subordination was at&#xD;
an end, and that their white tyrants were trying&#xD;
to escape from a foe strnger than they, began to&#xD;
inflict upon them the most horrible revenge.&#xD;
Half-a-dozen of them would rush upon a sailor.&#xD;
and swing him against the mast like mad furies,&#xD;
till they dashed out his brains.  Others fell up-&#xD;
on the men, and jumped upon them, tore their&#xD;
throats, thrust their 'hands into their mouths,&#xD;
and, wrenching back their Jaws, broke them, and&#xD;
tore; their tongues out and devoured them.&#xD;
They were turned to so many wild beasts, and&#xD;
went to their horrid work of revenge, howling&#xD;
and barking, acting like a pack of the most in-&#xD;
furiated wolves. The sailors who could avoid&#xD;
them leaped overboard, shrieking with horror&#xD;
to avoid such a dreadful death as their compan-&#xD;
ions had suffered. Wynya' became the chief&#xD;
objgot of the, rage o( some :ofthein, who bad&#xD;
driven him to the taffrail, and . were~ only ye"&#xD;
&#xD;
vented from rushing on him to tear him in&#xD;
pieces, by the influence of Edward, who cour-&#xD;
ageously stood between him and the howling&#xD;
pack. But they would not pass him. They&#xD;
loved him. He had ever a kind look and a&#xD;
smile for one and all, whenever, on the passage,&#xD;
they were suffered to come on deck. He aid-&#xD;
ed them in dressing their wounds; he was a&#xD;
ministering angel among them; and for his&#xD;
humanity Wynyard had only laughed at him,&#xD;
and told him that they would sooner cut his&#xD;
throat than .that of any man they feared' on&#xD;
board. But Edward knew to (the contrary.&#xD;
He believed that the poor Africans were human&#xD;
beings; and that though ignorant, and oppress-&#xD;
ed, and black, they knew what gratitude was.&#xD;
He was now reaping the fruits of his benevo-&#xD;
lent feelings and conduct towards them.&#xD;
"We no hurtee you-we killee him!   We&#xD;
drink him blood !" said the leader of the pack,&#xD;
in broken English.&#xD;
"You must not touch him; he is my friend,"&#xD;
said Edward, who expected his manner and&#xD;
gestures to be understood, rather than his words.&#xD;
"Keep the devils off, Blacklock," cried&#xD;
Wynyard, his voice trembling with horror.&#xD;
'"Keep them off, if you can, till the boats reach&#xD;
us. I would rather be hanged, than torn limb&#xD;
from limb, as they have done most of our&#xD;
wretched men."&#xD;
"Leap into the water and swim to the bar,"&#xD;
said Edward, "I fear I shall not be able to re-&#xD;
strain them much longer."'&#xD;
"The water is full of them swimming about,&#xD;
and the bar is black with them. This is horri-&#xD;
ble-my game is up, I see, at last."&#xD;
While he was speaking, two of the strongest&#xD;
and most herealean of the naked savagessud-&#xD;
denly caught Edward in their arms, and, with-&#xD;
out hurting him, bore him to the'rear among&#xD;
their fellows. Edward at the same moment&#xD;
heard the captain shriek and two pistols go off.&#xD;
But he could not aid him, for he was held fm-&#xD;
ly by his captors, w - e the others 'had sprung&#xD;
forward to make      pain their prey. He&#xD;
had discharged his pistols at them, and leaped'&#xD;
into the sea.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Pull lively, my lads," called out the lieu-&#xD;
tenant in comiland of the frigate's leading boat,&#xD;
as the noise of the confusion aboard grew loud-&#xD;
er, and the shrieks of the men torn limb from&#xD;
limb pierced the sky, " there is dreadful work&#xD;
going on there. Give way all, hard and strong!t&#xD;
Hard away !  Spring to your oars!"&#xD;
The flash of two pistols revealed the deck of&#xD;
of the schooner, crowded with the blacks, and&#xD;
that they had'taken the vessel was clear. The&#xD;
next moment the boat was within ten fathoms,&#xD;
when Wynyard called from-the water to be tak-&#xD;
en on board. He was dragged in, glad to pur-&#xD;
chase life by capture, and the boat lay on her&#xD;
oars off the schooner's quarter, and the lieuten-&#xD;
ant hailed, for the noise of the negroes ceased'&#xD;
at the sight of the boats.&#xD;
" What schooner is that? Who commands&#xD;
her?"&#xD;
"She is a slaver," answered Edward, who&#xD;
had been released by his savage but friendly&#xD;
detainers.  "She has struck the bar, and the&#xD;
slaves, of which there are about three hundred,&#xD;
have risen and driven overboard or slain the&#xD;
crew and captain. Your 'arrival is most 'wel&#xD;
come."&#xD;
"'that man doesn't talk much like a slaver,"&#xD;
said a middy in the third cutter.&#xD;
" Who are you-if your captain is over-&#xD;
board ?"&#xD;
"I am only a chance passenger."&#xD;
" And have you influence over the negroes,&#xD;
that you are not hartned '?"&#xD;
" I believe so. 1 have been kind to them."&#xD;
" Then tell them that we are friends, and&#xD;
that we will send them back to their oWn coun-J&#xD;
try."&#xD;
Edward turned to make this information plain&#xD;
to them by gestures and words, and he had' thk'&#xD;
satisfaction of knowing that he was understood;'-&#xD;
for they clapped their hands, they laughed, theta&#xD;
shouted, they crowded about him, they kissed his&#xD;
hands, his feet, liis garments. All this wde&#xD;
witnessed by'the English with surprise and won--&#xD;

from the wrecked- slaver.  As the day broke,&#xD;
they completed their task of humanity ; and&#xD;
then, after stripping t-he schooner of whatever&#xD;
was of value, they set her on fire. But before&#xD;
she was burned to the water's edge, the frigate&#xD;
was under weigh, and standing ,argss the Atlan-&#xD;
tic, with the three hundred rescued Africans.-&#xD;
At the end of the eleventh day after leaving&#xD;
Rio, the ship of-war came to, off the mouth of&#xD;
the Cyprian river, and sent five armed boats up&#xD;
to -the barranca, which they, surprised, taking&#xD;
the three factors prisoners. The next day the&#xD;
blacks were brought up from the frigate, and&#xD;
the meeting between them and those whom the&#xD;
English had liberated from the barranca, was a&#xD;
touching exhibition of affection and delight.&#xD;
The next day the British Admiral ordered&#xD;
the barranga to be burned to the ground. The&#xD;
Africans, eight hundred in number, were then&#xD;
supplied with a week's provision from the ship's&#xD;
stores, and sent back to the interior, each to his&#xD;
own tribe and home.&#xD;
This act of humanity accomplished, the frig-&#xD;
ate once more spread her canvass to the tropical&#xD;
winds, and laid her course northward. Being&#xD;
short of provisions, she put into Gibralter. After&#xD;
remaining here a few days, she set sail for Eng-&#xD;
land, and arrived at Portsmouth on the, forty-&#xD;
ninth day after her departure from Rio Jan-&#xD;
eiro-&#xD;
During this period of time on the ocean,&#xD;
events the most interesting to Edward Black-&#xD;
look took place. It will be remembered that&#xD;
Captain Wynyard was saved from death by&#xD;
drowning, by being picked up by the lead-&#xD;
ing boat of the frigate. Edward was also taken&#xD;
prisoner, but very handsomely treated by the&#xD;
officer of the boat, who, on taking him on board&#xD;
the frigate, made known the manner the ne-&#xD;
groes had crowded about him in gratitude, and&#xD;
he stated that mainly through his influence&#xD;
over them, they were enabled to get them to&#xD;
go into the boats, without violence.&#xD;
." Who are you, sir, that, having so much&#xD;
humanity, I find you on board a slaver ?" de-&#xD;
manded Lord Clifford, as Edward was'placed&#xD;
before him.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am an American, sir.  I have had reo&#xD;
part is this slave-stealing. Unfortunate eircum-&#xD;
stances, not inclination, find me in such com-&#xD;
pany."&#xD;
"We have only your word for it."&#xD;
"There stands the captain, who will do me&#xD;
the justice to confirm my words, as he can have&#xD;
no motive in withholding the truth."&#xD;
"You are then the captain of the schooner,"&#xD;
said the nobleman, fixing his eyes upon Wyn-&#xD;
yard, who stood before him, guarded by two&#xD;
marines. " I did not know we had been so.&#xD;
fortunate."&#xD;
"I am her captain," answered Wynyard, in&#xD;
a sullen tone of defiance.&#xD;
"You must know, then; that the British gov-&#xD;
ernment regards slave-stealing on the high seas&#xD;
as a capital crime."&#xD;
"I know that I am likely to be hanged.'&#xD;
"And    this young'man.  Does he speak&#xD;
truth ?"&#xD;
" Yes. He did not know that I was a slaver&#xD;
when we embarked at  Cadiz. I knew that he&#xD;
had been unfortunate, and invited him to go&#xD;
with me ; but until I reached the coast of Afri-&#xD;
ca, he had no. idea of my pursuit."&#xD;
"I am glad to hear this," answered the no-&#xD;
bleman, who regarded Edward with looks of&#xD;
interest.  "But I will examine into the matter&#xD;
by and by. There are how many of, the crew.&#xD;
of the schooner saved ?" he asked of the lieu-&#xD;
tenant who had command of the boats.&#xD;
"Five in all ! The others are at the gang-&#xD;
way, under guard.' The rest were torn in&#xD;
pieces, they say, by the infuriated revenge of&#xD;
the blacks, when they broke fromFthe hold."&#xD;
"Bring the men aft."&#xD;
When they were placed befcrt.:im, Lord&#xD;
Clifford pointed to Edward, and said'&#xD;
" What rank did this person Rhold in your&#xD;
vessel?  Was he not a lieutenant'?"&#xD;
"No,'" answered one of the men, bluntly,&#xD;
"l e was only a passenger."&#xD;
" More like a preacher,  way he acted to-&#xD;
wards the darkies," s '      second. "He.&#xD;
treated:'em ,as if they h  btblood in 'em."&#xD;

to do with the slave business. He interposed&#xD;
to-night, at the risk of his life, to prevent the,&#xD;
order of the captain to throw all the negroes&#xD;
overboard, when you were chasing us, from be-&#xD;
ing'executed. I'll say that much for him, for,&#xD;
though I may- have my own neck stretched, I&#xD;
don't want to see an innocent man hanged."&#xD;
" This is favorable to you, Mr. Blacklock,"&#xD;
said the nobleman, "now if you will come in-&#xD;
to my cabin, I wish to have a little more par-&#xD;
ticular conversation with you, upon the peculiar&#xD;
position in which I find you placed. I wish to&#xD;
either treat you as an honest man, or put you&#xD;
in irons as a slaver with the rest. Come with&#xD;
me, and let me hear your own account of your-&#xD;
self. Put the rest," he added to an officer,&#xD;
"under guard, and iron them to the deck."&#xD;
While Wynyard and the three seamen were&#xD;
taken away in chains, the former sullen and si-&#xD;
lent, and' the latter apparently indifferent to&#xD;
their fate, Edward followed the nobleman who&#xD;
commanded the frigate to his state-cabin. He&#xD;
then bade him be seated, and dismissing his at-&#xD;
tendants to the ante-room, said with looks of&#xD;
kindly interest, as he gazed fixedly upon his&#xD;
face:&#xD;
"You say you are an' American."&#xD;

&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
expression in them, as if he were trying to re-&#xD;
.cover a resemblance; while at certain sounds of&#xD;
his voice, his face flushed up with a broken re-&#xD;
collection of some half forgotten tones.&#xD;
At the expiration of an hour, or a little more,.&#xD;
Edward brought the history of his life down to'&#xD;
that time. He was interrupted more than once&#xD;
in his long and faithful narrative-in which he&#xD;
concealed nothing that is already known to out&#xD;
readers-by exclamations of surprise, of inter-&#xD;
est, of sympathy.&#xD;
When he had ended, Lord Clifford, pale as&#xD;
marble, said in a tremulous voice: "You have&#xD;
spoken of a name on the chest. Do you recol-&#xD;
lect it ?"&#xD;
" It was CLIFFORD 'ST. CLAIR !" answered&#xD;
Edward, with surprise at the noble lord's deep&#xD;
emotion; and all the while trying to remember&#xD;
where he had seen, whether in dreanis or waking,&#xD;
his form and face, and heard the tones of his&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"Mr. Blacklock," said Lord Clifford, in the'&#xD;
greatest agitation, "will you take off your coat&#xD;
and let me see your left arm, near the shoulder.'&#xD;
"May I ask your lordship what-"&#xD;
"I beg of you, do not question me--but&#xD;
oblige me at once."&#xD;
Edward obeyed, and bared his arm, upon&#xD;
which, half way between the shoulder and el=&#xD;
bow, Lord Clifford discovered a device in India"&#xD;
ink.&#xD;
"How long have you had that mark ?" he&#xD;
asked with nervous' emotion almost beyond con&#xD;
trol.&#xD;
Ever.since I can remember anything."&#xD;
"My son-my son ! Heaven has at length&#xD;
restored to me my son !" he cried aloud, and,&#xD;
clasping Edward to his heart, he wept on hii"&#xD;
shoulder.' Who can describe the joyful emVo.&#xD;
tions of Edward, as he found himself locked&#xD;
in the arms of his father-for' his heart had ir'&#xD;
stinctively yearned towards him from the first'&#xD;
moment he gazed on his face and heard his&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
After a while, when Lord Clifford had beeomo&#xD;
composed, he called together theofficers into his&#xD;
cablin, and presenting to them Eldward as hia&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, my lord," answered Edward, with&#xD;
manly candor, looking him full in the face.&#xD;
"And your name is Blacklock -"&#xD;
"Yes-at least-yes, it is, I believe, my&#xD;
lord."&#xD;
"You hesitate ! This does not look well,&#xD;
est? If I find you are not fair with me,, I shall&#xD;
let you go with the rest, and let the law, not I;&#xD;
decide your fate." The nobleman's majestic&#xD;
'and benevolent countenance was slightly flash-&#xD;
sd with -anger as he spoke.&#xD;
"My lord," said Edward, "I do not intend&#xD;
to resort to double-dealing with you. If you&#xD;
will listen to my story, it will explain to you&#xD;
why I hesitated ; and I ought to tell it to you&#xD;
also, in order to show you how it chanced that&#xD;
I was on board the sver."&#xD;
" I will listen to you," answered Lord Olif-&#xD;
ford, whose eyes rested on his features with' an&#xD;

&#xD;
sBn-long lost put at last;found--related to them 1&#xD;
his history and how he had identified him; and&#xD;
then added the following explanation, though in1&#xD;
more extended particulars than we have space to&#xD;
give it, of the manner in which he had lost him&#xD;
in his infancy.&#xD;
"We were passing a few weeks after a long&#xD;
cruise-being a lieutenant only-at my castle in&#xD;
the northern part of Europe. I had been mar-&#xD;
ried four years to Lady Mary, Countess of Bel-&#xD;
brook. We had one child, a son. I had taken&#xD;
to my castle with me, which borders the sea, a&#xD;
seaman who was much attached to me, and de-&#xD;
lighted to be in my service.  It is Ben Brown-&#xD;
all there," said the nobleman, pointing to an&#xD;
old tar whom he had ordered to be sent for from&#xD;
the deck, and who now stood a little in the rear&#xD;
with his tarpaulin off." One day Ben had the&#xD;
child out on the cliff playing with it ; and we&#xD;
trusted it to him, as he was fond of it, and care-&#xD;
ful, and it pleased him to have charge of it some-&#xD;
times.  On the day in question he had been ab-&#xD;
sent longer than usual, and when he returned&#xD;
the boy to the nurse, she noticed that it winced'&#xD;
when its arm was touched. {Upon examination&#xD;
by the Countess it was discovered to her horror,&#xD;
that the seaman had pricked in India ink the in-&#xD;
itials of his name, Clifford St. Clair Clifford,&#xD;
entwining them with a wreath and surmounting&#xD;
the whole device with the British Flag.  But&#xD;
what then gave us so much displeasure, and ban-&#xD;
ished Ben forever from the castle, has enabled&#xD;
me without a doubt to identify my lost son., Ed.&#xD;
ward, my son, show your arm to Ben. Did you&#xD;
do that?"&#xD;
"I did, your honor-that is my tattooing.. I&#xD;
would know it any where. But I did'nt do it&#xD;
og this gentleman.  That is what I did on my&#xD;
poor little young lord, twenty years ago. This&#xD;
must be him, for I never did such a work on any&#xD;
other arm. It sickened me ever after that.&#xD;
A1d he looks like him, too, my lord i" added&#xD;
Ben, with looks of joy.&#xD;
"And it is my son, Ben ; I have found him.&#xD;
Shake him by the hand, and welcome him back&#xD;
after all his wanderings.&#xD;
" Now, gentlemen, I wish you to learn how&#xD;
&#xD;
I lost him. There had been a poacher on my&#xD;
estate who was a vicious man; and not only&#xD;
took my game, but committed other robberies.&#xD;
I had him arrested, and after serving a year's&#xD;
imprisonment he escaped. About the same time&#xD;
my son was taken from the nurse when she was&#xD;
walking with him on the beach, by twof..men&#xD;
who came from the castle, bearing to a boat a&#xD;
chest, loaded, as was afterwards understood, with&#xD;
plate which they had boldly taken in open day&#xD;
while the Countess and most of the servants&#xD;
were at church   One of the men, whom the,&#xD;
nurse recognized as the poacher, caught the child&#xD;
from her, saying :&#xD;
"With this boy I shall complete my revenge,&#xD;
on my lord !"&#xD;
Notwithstanding her shrieks, they bore off the,&#xD;
chest and boy in the boat, and went down the.&#xD;
coast. That was the last ever heard br seen of&#xD;
my lost son until this morning, when I have so&#xD;
strangely discovered him. Every' means were&#xD;
used to trace him; and two years afterwards it&#xD;
was told me by a Yorkshire man that he had&#xD;
received a letter from a kinsman in America,&#xD;
who said that the poacher, had been hanged&#xD;
there for a murder. Advertisements were then&#xD;
inserted in the American papers, but without.,&#xD;
throwing any light upon the mystery. It is&#xD;
probable, that finding the child a troublesome&#xD;
burden he at length got rid of it by placing it.&#xD;
in the chest and sending it down the river,.to&#xD;
share whatever fate Providence, might guide it&#xD;
to."&#xD;
Our story now   approaches its conclusion.&#xD;
The reader will already have foreseen that upon&#xD;
Edward's arrival in Europe he was recognized-by&#xD;
the Countess, his mother, and embraced as her&#xD;
son. He was received to all the privileges and&#xD;
honors of the high rank to which his birth enti-,&#xD;
tied him ; and not the least part of Lord Clif-&#xD;
ford's gratitude was that his son was educated&#xD;
and fitted byperson and refinement for the ele-&#xD;
vated position which had now become his. ,Old&#xD;
Ben, instead of being in disgrace was invited to,&#xD;
the castle and commissioned for life to take care&#xD;
of the yacht and pleasure boats; and in his&#xD;
leisure hours he printed with India ink uponi the&#xD;

Our story is now ended, when we have added,&#xD;
that, the following year, the paragraph below ap-&#xD;
peared in the American papers:&#xD;
"There have been four or five instances of&#xD;
the marriage of English noblemen with our&#xD;
Anerican belles ; and we have now to record a&#xD;
recent instance of a similar character. Last&#xD;
week at "Grasmere Hall," near Brookline,&#xD;
Lord Clifford M. Clair Clifford, about whose&#xD;
&#xD;
life we learn there is something of romance, led&#xD;
to the altar Isabel Lawrence, heiress and only&#xD;
daughter of the late General Lawrence. Lady&#xD;
Clifford, we are sure, will grace by her beauty&#xD;
and accomplishments, the elevated position to&#xD;
which she is called, and honorably represent at&#xD;
the British Court the graces and intellect of&#xD;
American women."&#xD;
Dame Blacklock was at the wedding, and&#xD;
Paul Lovewell and the fair Kate, all of whom&#xD;
rejoiced in the happiness and high honors of the&#xD;
noble pair.&#xD;
If we appended morals to our stories, instead&#xD;
of leaving them to elucidate their own, we&#xD;
should here say, that honor, and virtue, and&#xD;
truth will certainly be rewarded in this life, and&#xD;
vice and evil-doing certainly have its measure&#xD;
meted out to it.&#xD;

There is a small town, a few miles distant&#xD;
from Edinburgh, in which were located (a few&#xD;
years ago), the head quarters of an English&#xD;
regiment-who occupied the time-worn old bar-&#xD;
racks, for a while, during the fall, to recruit,&#xD;
after a service in the metropolis and provinces.&#xD;
The detachment was commanded by a dashing&#xD;
young captain, and his first lieutenant was a&#xD;
brave and equally showy officer. Time neces-&#xD;
sarily hung heavy upon their hands-for the&#xD;
duties of the day were the same, week in and&#xD;
week out; and divers were the plans adopted&#xD;
to while away the hours which were unoccupied&#xD;
with the observance of their military duties.&#xD;
Amongst the acquaintances they made during&#xD;
their stay at Elson, was that of the family of a&#xD;
very wealthy wool-grower, residing upon a fine&#xD;
Scotch estate, some four miles from the bar-&#xD;
racks, and whither the captain and the lieuten-&#xD;
ant were continually drawn, by the bewitching&#xD;
manners and graceful persons of old bIcDon-&#xD;
ough's two daughters.                 .-&#xD;
"Look weel to yersel's, young lassies," the&#xD;
old gentleman .would say to hisdaughters,'&#xD;
&#xD;
"look weel to yersel's.  There's many a care-&#xD;
less heart beneath a bonnie waistcoat."&#xD;
To the young officers he would add: "Have&#xD;
a care, yoong gentlemen ; the bairns are win-&#xD;
some, an' I wad na hae you steal their gude&#xD;
dispositions-for I dinna like the soldier's&#xD;
life, for them. So have a care, I say."&#xD;
The officers smiled, the girls laughed aloud,&#xD;
at the old gentleman's fears, and time went on.&#xD;
Winter had worn away, and the visits of the&#xD;
captain and his lieutenant had got to be more&#xD;
frequent than ever. A large party was given&#xD;
at McDonough's mansion, and everybody of&#xD;
note, within a dozen miles, was in attendance.&#xD;
Among the visitors, was a maiden lady of five&#xD;
and thirty-at least-who was excessively for-&#xD;
bidding in her personal appearance, and whom&#xD;
the rollicking daughters of McDonough forced&#xD;
upon the attention of the handsome captain.&#xD;
She was accompanied by a maiden aunt, too&#xD;
-quite as plain and ungainly as herself. This&#xD;
latter personage was commended to the particu-&#xD;
lar attention of the gallant lieutenant !  The&#xD;
girls enjoyed the sport excedingly, and for a&#xD;

time the hall rung with their laughter and jest,&#xD;
at the expense of their two young military&#xD;
friends-whom they both were sadly in love&#xD;
with, by the way-but upon whom they thought&#xD;
to play a practical joke, knowing that the caps&#xD;
tain and his junior friend pretended to be punc-&#xD;
tiliously fastidious in matters appertaining to&#xD;
female grace and loveliness.&#xD;
If Captain Alworth got uneasy, the witching,&#xD;
rollicking Msg was at his elbow to urge him&#xD;
forward, and to descant upon the duty of milita-&#xD;
ry men to be civil to all the representatives of&#xD;
the gentler sex under all circumstances. Then&#xD;
she would dart away, and coquette with some&#xD;
fancied rival of the captain's-while her sister,&#xD;
as active, and playful, and thoughtless as herself,&#xD;
would be after young Lieutenant Boggs, with&#xD;
an admonition to see°to his good old "aunty,"&#xD;
with whom he had evidently became so sudden-&#xD;
ly, but so severely smitten.&#xD;
Thus matters went on for three hours-when&#xD;
the captain got released from "escort duty,"&#xD;
for a moment, and hailing his friend, the twain&#xD;
retired to a recess at the other end of the hall.&#xD;
"What do you think of this, leff?" he ask-&#xD;
ed, good-naturedly.&#xD;
"It is very provoking, upon my honor. Effie&#xD;
has not honored me with her hand once to-night."&#xD;
"And Mag has dodged me," said the cap-&#xD;
tain, " in the same way. Not once have I&#xD;
danced with her."&#xD;
"It is altogether too bad."&#xD;
" Isay so, leff, decidedly."&#xD;
"What is to be done ?"&#xD;
"The little minxes enjoy this, amazingly."&#xD;
"So I see.  It's a made-up thing."&#xD;
" Let's retire."&#xD;
"No; that wouldn't do ; no retreating-in&#xD;
this skirmish."&#xD;
"Well, what do you propose ?"&#xD;
"Let's punish them."&#xD;
"Agreed-but how ?"&#xD;
"4Continue the flirtation, in earnest,  That&#xD;
is, make love to the old girls-let them over-.&#xD;
hear it, and frighten them into better behaviour&#xD;
for the future."&#xD;
Capital! Isee--&#xD;
&#xD;
" Go on then. Post yourself, and let's be&#xD;
about it."&#xD;
The noisy, happy, frolicksome girls had no&#xD;
idea of this sort of retaliation ; and when mid'&#xD;
night came, supper was announced. Their sur-&#xD;
prise may be imagined, when they searched&#xD;
among the crowd for their acknowledged lovers,&#xD;
to observe that the two splendid military officers,&#xD;
whom every one had so much admired during&#xD;
the evening, were slowly sauntering down the&#xD;
great hall, each with one of the "old maids "&#xD;
upon his arm, deeply engaged in converse !&#xD;
At supper, the captain and the 'lieutenant&#xD;
were most assiduous in their attention to their&#xD;
new-made female friends-and, though it cost&#xD;
them a severe effort, they devoted themselves&#xD;
entirely to "aunty" and her friend, to the ut-&#xD;
ter neglect of the two Scotch beauties, whom&#xD;
they still loved, but whom they resolved to be&#xD;
even with.&#xD;
Mag and Effie were uneasy. They looked&#xD;
for the captain and lieutenant, after the repast,&#xD;
and found them still busily engaged with aunty&#xD;
and her companion. They had ceased to laugh,&#xD;
and already put themselves in the way of the&#xD;
usually gallant officers, who replied with a pod,&#xD;
or a plain "yes" and "no," to.what they p.i.&#xD;
pounded--turning quickly from them towhat.&#xD;
peared to be "metal more attractive !" The&#xD;
Scotch beauties made themselves utterly miser'&#xD;
able, at last-for it was so contrived that the&#xD;
two soldiers made them overhear their offers of&#xD;
marriage, to aunty and her friend.&#xD;
Old McDonough's daughters became desper&#xD;

two handsomest men in the province. They&#xD;
had each proposed himself to the sisters, and&#xD;
each had been secretly accepted. They were&#xD;
traitors--ingrates-w-deserters-everything  that&#xD;
was ugly, hideous and dishonorable.  What&#xD;
was to be done ?&#xD;
The two maiden ladies had never had an of-&#xD;
fer of marriage before ; and though each one&#xD;
declared, (and honestly, too 1) that' "it was&#xD;
very sudden, and onexpected," and that they&#xD;
had " had no idee that the gentleman was so&#xD;

and they are still single, and at liberty."&#xD;
A sigh escaped the lips of the captain, but&#xD;
his friend proceeded.&#xD;
"Captain, believe me, when I assure you&#xD;
that the sisters are handsomer than ever. They&#xD;
still retain that joyous disposition and sunny&#xD;
cheerfulness which we loved in "auld lang&#xD;
syne," and they harbor no ill temper towards&#xD;
us. They are as beautiful, as bright, as glori-&#xD;
ous as ever-though I think there is a shade of&#xD;
sobriety in Mag, that I have never before wit-&#xD;
nessed- --and which exhibited itself peculiarly&#xD;
when, in answer to her query, I said that when&#xD;
we left England, your " aunty " was well.&#xD;

"'I he old fellow who is with them, is very&#xD;

"Well.'.'&#xD;
" And he suffers nobody to approach them,&#xD;
at home or abroad, I understand, with marriage&#xD;
intent-for as soon as they wed, they, are no&#xD;
longer under his control."&#xD;
"Well, well-what of that?"&#xD;
"What of that, man ! Upon my word you&#xD;
are not so keen-scented as you once were, cap-&#xD;
ain. What of- that?  Why, to be brief, this&#xD;
of it.  I propose to pounce on the old fellow,&#xD;
where he now lounges, since dinner-half asleep-&#xD;
and half muddled with the generous Burgundy&#xD;
he has quaffed-bind him hand and foot, and&#xD;
run off with the girls ! That's all !"&#xD;
"A valiant man, are you, leff-very," re-&#xD;
sponded the captain, still in deep thought.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Come then-wake up ! What say you ?--&#xD;
Shall I have your aid, or shall I go alone 2"&#xD;
" What is to be done with Mag ?" asked the&#xD;
captain, feelingly. "You propose to marry&#xD;
Effie, I take it. But you don't want both of&#xD;
the girls, surely."'&#xD;
Will you join me? I tell you again, there&#xD;
is no time to be lost."&#xD;
"Away with you, then, leftenant. Order&#xD;
post horses. My purse and my hand are yours,&#xD;
and my sword and life are at your service I"&#xD;
" GoodI We will trust to fortune, and be&#xD;
governed by circumstances. Mag will be re-&#xD;
joiced to meet you, at any rate. Alions."&#xD;
There was a lively bustle in front of the lit-&#xD;
tle old inn, a few minutes afterwards, and a ve"&#xD;
bide was soon ready, with four spanking road-&#xD;
sters before it. There was no occasion for the&#xD;
" binding band and foot," as the lieutenant&#xD;
proposed, for the young ladies' guardian had&#xD;
sogged away, after his cups-and was fast asleep&#xD;
in his chair, when the lovers hastily entered the&#xD;
apartment.&#xD;
A joyful, but silent interchange of recogni-&#xD;
tion took place-the girls smiled at the sudden&#xD;
offer of the lieutenant--everything was quickly&#xD;
put in readiness-and our four friends sprang&#xD;
into the coach, as the captain and his companion&#xD;
promised the sisters, on the honor of lovers and&#xD;
soldiers, that all should be immediately and&#xD;
satisfactorily explained. Away went the vehi-&#xD;
cle, with its precious load, and long before the&#xD;
old gentleman recovered his senses, the lovers&#xD;
were far beyond pursuit.&#xD;
In due time. the runaways reached the French&#xD;
capitol. The money of the lieutenant held out&#xD;
amazingly; there was still enough of it left,&#xD;
to -keep up respectable appearances, for a time.&#xD;
The captain found a letter a Paris-the first&#xD;
he had received since his departure from Lon-&#xD;
don. It was superscribed in a strange hand,&#xD;
and bore a mourning seal. le opened it, and&#xD;
learned that his wife had been dead over three&#xD;
months--having fallen from her horse while rid-&#xD;

&#xD;
ing out, and received injuries which termina-&#xD;
ted fatally, a few hours after the accident.&#xD;
He was almost frantic with excitement, at&#xD;
this intelligence ; and the lieutenant' bore him&#xD;
away to his room, in the midst of the paroxysm&#xD;
which succeeded the perusal of the letter. He&#xD;
'oon cooled off, however, and two days after-&#xD;
ward he attended a wedding at St. Stephen's.&#xD;
It' was .the union of the lieutenant and the&#xD;
charming Effie McDonough.&#xD;
The party proceeded forthwith to London,&#xD;
after the last mentioned performance, and the&#xD;
day succeeding their retreat, the old guardian&#xD;
arrived at Paris, in search of the fugitives, whom&#xD;
he had finally traced thither. But the birds&#xD;
had flown.&#xD;
&#xD;
A fortnight after reaching London, Mag Mc-&#xD;
Donough became the wife of the generous-heart-&#xD;
ed captain.  Old scores were obliterated-the&#xD;
parties were severally happy, in redeeming&#xD;
themselves, and in enjoying their " first loves "&#xD;
-and mutual promises had been earnestly en-&#xD;
tered into, to forgive and forget the jealousies&#xD;
of the past.&#xD;
The lazy guardian finally found his precious&#xD;
wards, but his authority over them and their for-&#xD;
tunes, (which, by the way, were very handsome),&#xD;
had long since ceased. They were united to&#xD;
the men of their own first choice, and years of&#xD;
happiness and prosperity succeeded the Dou-&#xD;
