&#xD;
"I leave you," she said.  " May God- keep&#xD;
Fou !"n&#xD;
The clamor was redoubled below. She stole&#xD;
,own the stairs softly. She made less noise&#xD;
than the flutter of a canary's wing.&#xD;
It was the time  between day and night.&#xD;
Liht and dark.iness were mingled in such pro-&#xD;
,ortions that neither predor mated. People&#xD;
beheld each other through a soft mist.&#xD;
Clai went to a window and threw it up. She&#xD;
was not afraid. She felt confident of her power&#xD;
to parley with these without.&#xD;
"Who clamors at the door? Is this the&#xD;
way to enter a neighbor's house ?" she de-&#xD;
manded, with great calmness.  " One would&#xD;
suppose, ' she added, "that a band of robbers,&#xD;
was at the door'&#xD;
A sudden silence fell  upon the turbulent&#xD;
spirits. Then one.spoke as follows:&#xD;
"Don't bother, Miss Clari, but let us in.&#xD;
We're after a Union renegade, and are bound to&#xD;
have him, let him lay ever so low, or hide ever&#xD;
Uo high." ,&#xD;
There was a half-suppressed brutality about'&#xD;
the voice that was quite apparent to Clari&#xD;
"Is that you, Aliek Harker?" she answered.&#xD;
" You did not formerly admission   in this&#xD;
fashion."&#xD;
" When he went a wooing," cried a rough&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
A hoarse laugh of approbation followed this&#xD;
remark.&#xD;
"And sneaked away with a down look," added&#xD;
another.&#xD;
"Silence, you bears," exclaimed Harker, ill&#xD;
pleased with these remarks. " Bygones are by-&#xD;
gones. Let bygones alone,.won'L ye ? It isn't safe&#xD;
to jeer ame, boys. A man may change his mind&#xD;
when he pleases, and be none the worse for't.&#xD;
Open the door, Miss Kinmouth, for it's my&#xD;
opinion you've stowed away. Mountain Max&#xD;
somewhere in this house; and I swear to you&#xD;
.        ''_, if we have to burn it down l&#xD;
nI uites can't live in Missouri."&#xD;
"Considhr that I'm  alone, Alick Harker,"&#xD;
she replied ; ":and have respect for my situ-&#xD;
ation. My father will return shortly, when you&#xD;
can search the house as long and as thoroughly&#xD;
is you please."&#xD;
"It won't do, Clari," sneered Harker; with&#xD;
an inslent familiarity that sent the blood'to&#xD;
the girl's cheeks. " You used to hurry to open&#xD;
the dnvr, once, you know."&#xD;
Ti was said with insulting significance.&#xD;
"To bid you, as I new do, begone !l' retorted&#xD;
;i, quickly.&#xD;
' She has you now, Alick !" shouted a burly&#xD;
.lian.&#xD;
"She was always handy with ~her tongue,"&#xD;
uttered' Harker. " But the time has come&#xD;
Nhen the tongues that speak not to our. minds&#xD;
unit be silent. Union or no Union, is the test&#xD;
question now.  Down with the Constitution&#xD;
&#xD;
and up with the Nigger ! That's the watch.&#xD;
word, boys."&#xD;
Several excited persons repeated Alick's ral-&#xD;
lying-cry in harsh and angry tones.&#xD;
Come, girl, will you push the bolt, or shall&#xD;
I order the-door to be forced ?" continued&#xD;
Harker, with increasing pertinacity.&#xD;
" I will remember this rudeness, sir," return-&#xD;
ed Clari, with dignmiied composure. "To pre-&#xD;
vent further violence, I will admit you, trusting&#xD;
that, when within, you will conduct yourself&#xD;
like men and neighbors."&#xD;
Clari Kinmouth drew the bolt and stepped&#xD;
back ; nor did she retreat too soon, for the&#xD;
door was thrown open with much violence,'and&#xD;
Harker, with his impatient followers at his&#xD;
heels, rushed in. The girl had goof eason to&#xD;
be terrified sit their appearance, for they be-&#xD;
longed to that lawless and disorderly class&#xD;
"hose appetites and wills were their sole and&#xD;
imperative masters. The political confusion of&#xD;
the times, the destruction of old landmarks, the&#xD;
apparent breaking up of the Federal Union,&#xD;
had removed every-wholesome restraint from&#xD;
men of this order, and -precipitated tfiem, with&#xD;
all their bad passions, brutal instincts, and&#xD;
natural ferocity, upon the better and conserva-&#xD;
tive elements of society. Secession madness&#xD;
ruled the hour, and nets 6f barbarity were com-&#xD;
mitted at which future historians will budder.&#xD;
Persecution, hate, and Murder walked hand in&#xD;
hand-a horrible trinity.&#xD;
The fellows who accompanied Alick Uarker&#xD;
were some of the sanguinary missionaries of the&#xD;
false Confederacy, acknowledging for its head&#xD;
and  chief director one Jefferson  Davis-a&#xD;
violent partisan, and an uscrupulously am;&#xD;
bitious man.&#xD;
Conversant with the deeds of these turbulent&#xD;
and' frightfully-in-earnest wretches, it is not&#xD;
strange that Clar's cheeks grew pale as they&#xD;
crowded, with fierce looks and -unseemly lan-&#xD;
guage, into, the house. But most of all did&#xD;
she shrink from their relentless leader, Alick&#xD;
MIarker-a person who once had the audacity&#xD;
to aspire to her favor. It was easy to see that&#xD;
his questionably passion was turning to malice&#xD;
and mischief. There was thatin his gray eyes&#xD;
which assured her that he knew no middle&#xD;
course, but must be either a fiery lover or a&#xD;
sullen hater.&#xD;
She endeavored to rally her energies. She&#xD;
met his frowning, glances with steadiness, and&#xD;
stood with seeming calmness while his six&#xD;
bearded outlaws took possession of the prem-&#xD;
ises, and glared- at her like hungry beasts.&#xD;
Sometime had been consumed 'n the park.&#xD;
at the door. The fading daylig t had grown&#xD;
dimmer, and the forms of the armed men wer&#xD;
more terrible for the misty glooma that envelop-&#xD;
ed them. Yet through twilight and deepening&#xD;
shadow she could see the expression of eciae,&#xD;
and the pale glinting of sabre and carbine.&#xD;

to destroy, to pillige and to kill, to burn and to&#xD;
lay waste."&#xD;
He paused, and turned hii eyes upon the fu-1&#xD;
gitive, who still hell Noah Dxon by the neck,&#xD;
much to his disconifort.'&#xD;
" Ilow is it, Max? How is it, my boy ?&#xD;
Haven't I pt 'cii whcre they elonig? ,haven't&#xD;
they chased you down as if % on was a wild&#xD;
beast, to be hairiel and worried, and rubbed&#xD;
out., at Dist., by lead, or by steel, or by halter ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"You are right," said Max,' impressively.&#xD;
"You awIys- jidge  crreeug . Y or guesses&#xD;

,I see ( cry dog  of' 'em, Max, and lie falls&#xD;

corner, determiinedIy&#xD;
" We three are enough for them," cried Kin-&#xD;
mouth, casting the cord from his neck with a&#xD;
hot flush of insulted imiaimhood.&#xD;
"Quite enough," said the man called Max,&#xD;
tightening his grasp on Dixon's neck. "I have&#xD;
thrown ",ie of the iscals out of the window .&#xD;
I heir him groaning among the brok' n glass&#xD;
below. Three true ien can cope within six ajse&#xD;
ones. I have anlwa3 ssfoundI that ai honest muan,&#xD;
in an honest cause, hias a stout ain :miiu  a stout&#xD;
beirt. Let the traitor, coimmence fhme attack."&#xD;
The man, Max, gave DixonI a pinch with his&#xD;
muscular fingers, that muale hin gasp like a&#xD;
fish just taken from the water.&#xD;
Shoot him !" imuttcredl Noah, who had no&#xD;
relish f,r the tortures of stranugulation. "Put&#xD;
a bullet throughmhimi, canut ye :''&#xD;
A  more rigid contractmou of the fingers&#xD;
stopped the fellow's voice.&#xD;
Woe to the man as draws a head on hita!"&#xD;
said tie in buckskin, raising his voice. - Grief&#xD;
to him as gives Mon..tail Max a supper *' lead !&#xD;
Or a dinner, or a breakfast don't, for thiit mat-,&#xD;
ter. It would be a burning' shame for a true&#xD;
mountainli mann, who's faced all manemir o' var-&#xD;
mints, in all manner o' places, '.hose eyes&#xD;

" That must be Nick Vhiiffles, or the devil I"&#xD;
exclaimed Alick Harkei, tlihrusting hIsis head for-&#xD;
ward, and staring inquisitively at the weather-&#xD;
beaten face of the stranger.&#xD;
No one replied. Tie iman of the moccasin.&#xD;
ed foot and leather hunting-shirt, drew himself&#xD;
us straighter, and smiled. 'There :was pride&#xD;
and calm sell'asurancc on his lips. lIe looked&#xD;
like a person' who asked no partieu!ar favor of&#xD;
any one, and that knew how to take care of&#xD;
himself in all places, and in every coutiigeiey&#xD;
of life.&#xD;
"I'll bet my skulp," growled   ugh m-tram&#xD;
ble, " that that d-d Fremont sedit for hiim, and&#xD;
lie's come down from the mountains of Califor-&#xD;
ny, where lie's been huntin' grizzlies, to have a&#xD;

"May the devil take Jessie and the little&#xD;
Mustanig !" added hlirketr, in ain undertone.&#xD;
Then to Ime inteuder. who stool chii iily in the.&#xD;
door : " Speak,,nister: Are you iNik, or Satan ?'&#xD;
&#xD;
MOUNTAIN MAX; Olt, NICK WHIFFLES-ON ThE BORDER.&#xD;
&#xD;
" A, man as knows so much, should know 1&#xD;
more," said the stranger, with composure.&#xD;
' But I was never afeard to speak the truth."&#xD;
Mountain Max shrugged his' shoulders, and&#xD;
curled his nether lip a trile.&#xD;
"Leastwise," quoth Nick, in a slightly quali-&#xD;
fying tone, "I may boldly say that I never was&#xD;
feared to speak my mind when there was occa-&#xD;
sion fort. I don't valley tellin' ye, mister" -he&#xD;
looked hard at Harker-~-" you nor- no other&#xD;
p'ison traitor as treads the sile o' the Fed'ral&#xD;
tUnion, that I'm Nick Whiffles, a;d - nothin'&#xD;
shorter ; Nick Whiffes from the mountains and&#xD;
valleys ; Nick Whiffles from tlje perairies and&#xD;
plains ; Nick Whifnes from the lakes, and riv-&#xD;
ers, and trappin'-grounds of the wide Nor'west !&#xD;
I'm he ! Oh yes! 0,Lord, yes !" .&#xD;
Nick looked gimtly at vacancy, after the old&#xD;
fashion ;. and the comical twinkle reappeared&#xD;
in his eyes.&#xD;
" He come down from the mountains with&#xD;
Miax," muttered Bramble, with a boding shake&#xD;
of the head.&#xD;
"You're wrong there, Secesher,"answered Nick.&#xD;
"We didn't come together, by no means. He come'&#xD;
fust, and I afterward.. I haven't been long in&#xD;
this rebellious nest, I allow. Didn't git here a&#xD;
minute too soon, neither. I'm jest in time for&#xD;
this little diflikilty."&#xD;
"If you know when you are well off, old&#xD;
boy," replied  Harker, menacingly, "you'll&#xD;
leave this little diffikilty, as you call it, imme-&#xD;
diately."&#xD;
" I never run away from a difilkilty," said&#xD;
Nick, with a negative motion of his head. "I&#xD;
never in my life run away from a diffikilty ;&#xD;
though I had a brother once who could run like&#xD;
A four-wheeled 'wagin.  He allers run, my&#xD;
o   if nr'h All his ancestors on his mother's&#xD;
siste side run afore him. ' Runnin' run in his&#xD;
blood, as 'twere. But there was one pecool-&#xD;
yarity about my brother's running : he allers&#xD;
ran toward the danger, and not from it."&#xD;
Nick glanced at Harker with a grim sort of&#xD;
humor. At the same time he drew his second&#xD;
revolver with his left hand, and with easy non-&#xD;
chalance of manner, cocked it. Each of his&#xD;
brown hands' now hield six shots. Nothwith&#xD;
standing his quietness, there was something in&#xD;
his air and attitude that overawed Alick Harker&#xD;
Rad his followers.,&#xD;
"I've heard of you,"said the rebel outlaw,&#xD;
doggedly. "Much has been 'said and 'written,&#xD;
about you ; but I don't believe half on't.&#xD;
You've been published in the newspapers, put&#xD;
on the stage, served up in books, translated into&#xD;
French, and hashed up in every style to suit&#xD;
the modern appetite ; but I care no more fir&#xD;
you than I should for any adventurer from the&#xD;
niountains. This is'a bad place for you to come&#xD;
to, Nick Whiffles. There's different pastime going&#xD;
on here from trapiiug beaver, shooting bears,&#xD;
aol picking off a naked Indian', now and then."&#xD;
&#xD;
16&#xD;
&#xD;
"Go on,:Secesh ; you've got the floor," said&#xD;
Nick.  " Speak your mind while you've got&#xD;
breath to spare ; for it's ten to one if you out-&#xD;
live this 'ere Secession  row.  I've ane for&#xD;
smarter men nor you be, early in the morain',&#xD;
afore breakfast. As for the stories ouve read,&#xD;
in the p'ison newspapers, I vc nothing' to say of&#xD;
'em, whatsomever.  It don't consarn You much&#xD;
whether they're true or false. A good many&#xD;
things are printed tiat are hard to believe.&#xD;
My gran'fathcr, the historian, published some&#xD;
vollums that was as true as Sizibad the Sailor,-&#xD;
and yet there was people bad enough tom shake&#xD;
their heads when they was readin' 'em. I'll die&#xD;
if there wasn't !"&#xD;
The corners of Nick's mouth twitched slight-&#xD;
ly, and he-threw a fugitive glance at Max.&#xD;
" The historian of your exploits and your&#xD;
grandfather were about alike, I should think,"&#xD;
said Harker, contemptuously. "'The author of&#xD;
'Nick Whiffles' would be out here taking Syees-&#xD;
sion notes if he wasn't afraid of Secession bul-&#xD;
lets. He finds it safer to concoct his Munehau-&#xD;
senisms under the brooding wings of the aboli-&#xD;
tion oligarchy, than to trust himself over the&#xD;
border, where steel, and not iik, is deciding the&#xD;
great question of, union ahd disunion."&#xD;
" As for that matter, Secceher, I've heard&#xD;
tell that them as cnn wield the 1(1n and make&#xD;
-printed books can wield- the sword and the rifle,&#xD;
likewise. But that's neither here nor there.&#xD;
I never like to talk of my own exploits, more&#xD;
nor I like to, hear a friend slandered bThind his&#xD;
back. They may print my name in as many&#xD;
languages as they please,.and I sha'n't be aone&#xD;
the worse for't. But ore thing I can tell ye,&#xD;
and tell ye hearty and true: I'm down on this&#xD;
Southern  Skedaderacy !  If ever a man was&#xD;
down on't, that  man is the:man afore ye. I&#xD;
love the starry banner of the United States.&#xD;
I do, by mighty! I haven't been much under&#xD;
its protection for some years o' my wanderin'&#xD;
life, but when I do bear its folds a flappin' over&#xD;
me, my heart begins to thrill with pride, and I&#xD;
feel a head taller nor any man atween heile and&#xD;
the Gulf. Whenever I look up and see the old&#xD;
flag, I swear to gracious, 1 feel as if I could&#xD;
lick a wagin-load o' traitors !"&#xD;
Nick set his teeth together, and breathed&#xD;
hard. Aliek Harker turned pale, for lie thought&#xD;
the man in moccasins    handled his weapons&#xD;
rather carelessly. He   moved uneasily. lie&#xD;
cleared his throat. and said, huskily :&#xD;
"You're on the wrong side, Nick Whites!&#xD;
Come over and help us.  We need you. Ay,&#xD;
and you needn't come    for nothing, either i&#xD;
You shall have Confederate gold and a Confed-&#xD;
erate commission. We could soon raise a regi-&#xD;
nent to fight under you. The fact is, your&#xD;
name is popular clear down the z iver to New&#xD;
Orleans.  I've heard ypn talked   cf on the&#xD;
steamboats and in camp, and I know "what I&#xD;

e lo k.     Float in nith the tide, Nick&#xD;

The rebel outlaw tried to get upconsiderable&#xD;
entlinsiasmr of tone and manner, but his remarks&#xD;
ntlnoawith an ill-grace, and with, more of slt&#xD;
leaness than  inspiration.  Nick heard him&#xD;
patiently and with apparent gravity. He lifted&#xD;
ie, shoulders and laughed quietly when Harker&#xD;
oeasel speaking.&#xD;
-"Confederate gold !" quoth he, incredulously.&#xD;
"1Let's see some omn't, will ye?  I'll give ye a&#xD;
handsome bonus for every dollar you've got in&#xD;
good yaller ore. If you'said Confederate brass,&#xD;
wouldd been a different thing; for I allow&#xD;
there's plenty o' that among ve, and a giniwine&#xD;
article, too, without any alloy of the precious&#xD;
metals in't. Confederate gold! - I want none&#xD;
oa't ! I aint up for sale yet ; when I am, Jeff&#xD;
Davis and his traveling' menagerie, can come&#xD;
and bid for ne, and p'r'aps I'l1 go cheap. If&#xD;
Jefi should chance to be the puiehaser, the&#xD;
best use he could put me to would be, hangin';&#xD;
for a disloyal critter that can be bought and&#xD;
sold, is better sawed up cold than t'otherwise,&#xD;
Confederates, I allow, are improved by hangin&#xD;
a few hours in the open air. As for a commis-,&#xD;
sion, I'd like to see the nian as would dare offer&#xD;
rue sich a monstrous humbug! You've got no&#xD;
gover'mnent, and where there's no gover'ient&#xD;
there's no authority.  The authority of the&#xD;
United States is surprene from Maine to Georgia,&#xD;
and from thie Rocky Mountains to the Gulf of&#xD;
Mexico. Don't talk your villainous treason to&#xD;
mce ! I can't turn traitor arter I've been a true&#xD;
man goin'-'on forty year.. Them there seven-&#xD;
starred rags won't do for me. I'd ruther fight&#xD;
under an -old woman's apron tied to a broom-&#xD;
pole, than to follow sichr a contemptible rag to&#xD;
battle. Oh yes, I'd rather lay down and die,&#xD;
than to fight for anything but the old banner.&#xD;
I want a flag that's got a history to't, and&#xD;
Liberty on't. I can't fight for cotton and nig-&#xD;
gers, but I can fight for freedom and the Union&#xD;
as hearty and faithful as any man that lives. I&#xD;
can do that. 0 Lord, yes 1".&#xD;
Nick raised his voice, and his rough cheeks&#xD;
glowed.&#xD;
"Don't talk to me no more in that way," he&#xD;
added. " I'm  mighty narvous, -gener'ly, and&#xD;
pistils sometimes go off o' their own accord,&#xD;
e'enaniost."&#xD;
"Shoot him, some on ye, can't ye !" stam-&#xD;
mered Noah Dixon, who still writhed in the&#xD;
ungentle grasp of Mountain Max.    "'Tisn't&#xD;
fair, this isn't."&#xD;
The pitiless fingers stopped all farther artic-&#xD;
ulation. - Ilarker and his crew were greatly&#xD;
embarrassed. They meant mischief, but had a&#xD;
wholesome fear of Nick Whiffles' revolvers.&#xD;
Each wished to make an attack, but no one had&#xD;
the courage to move first. Few men care to&#xD;
stir whern a pistol-brllet is the penalty of mo-&#xD;
tion.' Iarker felt that something must be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
.&#xD;
f ,&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
To stand longer, staring at ;Nick Whiffes, was&#xD;
useless ; not only useles-, but cowardly. Each _&#xD;
waited for the oter-each looked at the other&#xD;
-each inwardly cursed th6 tardiness, of the&#xD;
other. A silence ensued that was enjoyed by&#xD;
Nick only.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
MOUNTAIN AIlRS.&#xD;
The lamp burned dimly in the hands of&#xD;
Archie Roe. It threw an uncertain glimmer&#xD;
over all. It shimmered on the pale face of&#xD;
Clari ; flickered over the white lips of Clan.&#xD;
Clari felt faint and weary. She glanced at the&#xD;
man called Max - the stranger called Max,&#xD;
whom she had befriended. H:s eyes were upon&#xD;
her-hris eyes, dark and fall of gratitude. She&#xD;
looked down, and a sickly blush overspread her&#xD;
features.&#xD;
" If there is to be fighting," said Max, "let&#xD;
the ladies retire."&#xD;
" You couldn't have said anything more sen.&#xD;
sible," interposed Sally Dowse, who was en-&#xD;
gageal in the benevolent employment of support.&#xD;
ing the half-conscious Kit ty. - Stand aside,&#xD;
you land-pirate," she added, glancing with lofty&#xD;
contempt at Harker. "Stand out the way, and&#xD;
let me pass with this girl."&#xD;
Bearing her lovely burden, Miss .Dowse at-&#xD;
tempted tq pass the rufian, who, glad of any&#xD;
event to attract momentary diversion, sprang&#xD;
backward toward Archie Roe and struck the light&#xD;
from his hand. Friend arnd foe were instantly in&#xD;
darkness. There was a shuffling of feet, a hur-&#xD;
ried changin gof positions, and a detei-mined rush&#xD;
to the spot where Nick Whiffles had stood. Full&#xD;
of blind fury, each of the outlaws was anxious&#xD;
to give a wound to the sturdy mountaineer. In&#xD;
the light, all of them  had shrugri frum an-no&#xD;
tack ; but darkness, they imagined,  i-ed a&#xD;
sudden and effective onset. They were Aignal-&#xD;
ly foiled, for Nick had too mauchexperience to&#xD;
remain on the threshold for a mark. Sabres&#xD;
met and crossed in empty space. and several&#xD;
received wounds from their friends which were&#xD;
intended for another.. Sonie of the more reck-&#xD;
less of the disunionists discharged their pistols&#xD;
at random, but fortunately without injury.&#xD;
There was a pell-mell retreat down-stairs, one&#xD;
or two of the villains falling from the top guite&#xD;
to the bottom, in a very damnaging and perdous&#xD;
manner. Nick averred afterward that he hap-&#xD;
pened to be near the head of the stairease dur-&#xD;
ing their confused and clattering exit, and that&#xD;
some of them must have run violently against&#xD;
his elenced fist, and in a *ay calculated to&#xD;
disturb their respective centres of gravity.&#xD;
There was much limping and swearing in the,&#xD;
tall while one 'of them was fumbling for the&#xD;
door, and their spirits were far less jubilant&#xD;
than when they entered the pr-mrises.&#xD;
But it fared hardest withl Noah Dixon, for&#xD;
Mountain Max had held him fast during the&#xD;
&#xD;

snole parley.  The moment the lamp was ex-&#xD;
tinguislhed by fhirker, he lifted the knat e from&#xD;
his feet. and without much trouble dropped&#xD;
himn froii the window. Genuine expression of4&#xD;
paiu followed his rapid descent, and Max was&#xD;
satisfied that lie hal not escaped without some&#xD;
portion of the punishment, due to his deeds.4&#xD;
ibe greatest anxiety of Max was for the safety-&#xD;
of Clari. lie heard the pistol-shots with a&#xD;
shiver of alarm. lie felt his way toward her.&#xD;
lie found her ; he threw his arm abdhaL her,1&#xD;
and stood prepared to defend her; but the&#xD;
noise on the stairs, and presently at the door be-&#xD;
low, assured him that the room was clear-of theo&#xD;
rebel marauders. A few shots fired after them&#xD;
by Nick hastened their flight and dangerously&#xD;
wounded one of their number. Their horses&#xD;
had stampeded, and those who had come soI&#xD;
bravely-mounted and confident, went away on&#xD;
foot with far different feelings.J&#xD;
" They're runnin'," said Nick Whiffles..&#xD;
"The pmson critters are runnin', and I hope&#xD;
they w n't stop till they run straight into the&#xD;
Gulf. That's the only kind 'o' sei-bathin' for&#xD;
secession sickness, It'll be a mighty resort for'&#xD;
'em by-and-by, I allow. They'll go down in&#xD;
vast multitudes at the p'iht o' Fed'ral bago-&#xD;
aets."&#xD;
Nick blew the smoke from his revolver, and&#xD;
panted to think about the Gulf of Mexico as a&#xD;
rehei bath.&#xD;
Max felt Clari trembling, and gradually yield-&#xD;
ing to the reaction of intense excitement.  He&#xD;
staid her sinking formand  spoke words of&#xD;
cheer ; she heard then not ; the danger being&#xD;
passed, the great pressure upon her energies sud-&#xD;
denly removed, the revulsioni proved too much&#xD;
4r her-she-fainted. The larger the men, the&#xD;
sli'edt    els ; and the strongerlhe is,thme weak-&#xD;
er lie becoms when a pretty womanfaints. These&#xD;
general principles held good in the case of Max.&#xD;
But his embarrassinent did not arise from the&#xD;
mere awkwiardness cf inexperience. Clan had&#xD;
become- something more -to him than an object&#xD;
of common interest. She had stepped at once&#xD;
to the 'highest place iii his mind. Both hi&#xD;
reason and Ids 'imagination exalted her. H&#xD;
high qualities had suriised and pleased him,&#xD;
and given him a reverenhb for the- ohiraeter of&#xD;
woman, new and strange. Clari had 'thrilled&#xD;
-and magnetized liim. Clari, in fact, was the&#xD;
only person -he could think of, and she was now&#xD;
an absorbing thougt.it&#xD;
Fortunately, Archie Roe.emne to the rescue ;&#xD;
he re-lighteI his extinguished lamp, and Max'&#xD;
hailed its fitful rays with unfeigned satish'ae,&#xD;
tion. ImimediateJy there was a gathering of&#xD;
the household, and Sally Dowse and the negro&#xD;
girl Folly were, for a time, in great. denied,&#xD;
and exceedingly useful.&#xD;
By the united efforts of all concerned, sone-&#xD;
thing like order was finally restored, and the&#xD;
household and its visitors were quietly assembled&#xD;
&#xD;
in the lower part of the house. Clari, recovered&#xD;
from her temporary weakness, now looked firm&#xD;
and strena, although soniewhat pale. Kitty,&#xD;
quick in her emotions, was the first to be cheer&#xD;
tal and to- forget her recent terror. Sally&#xD;
Dowse was severe and dignified, and more seri-&#xD;
ous than usual. Folly chattered and laughed,&#xD;
and showed    her white  teeth   impressions&#xD;
made upon her fluctuating mind soon gave&#xD;
plaoe to others; arnd the sime thought seldom.&#xD;
held her long under its -influence. Robert Kin-&#xD;
mouth was the gravest of the parties. He re-&#xD;
alized the great danger from which he had es-&#xD;
caped, and for the first time since the breaking&#xD;
out of the Rebellion, understood the perils that&#xD;
surroundedl him and the evils of tLe times. TIe&#xD;
conviction'at length caine hometo his heart,&#xD;
that no man was safe at his own fire-side, and&#xD;
that even women could not find sanctuary at&#xD;
home. He looked atLis daughters, attthe crazed&#xD;
Archie a. his servants, and 'could not reprss&#xD;
a sigh of anxiety. Mountain Max, as he was&#xD;
persistently called by those who knew him, was&#xD;
silent and modest as a girl. If his cycs were&#xD;
somewhat excrsive in the direction of Clar, it&#xD;
is not to be wondered at, the circumstances be-&#xD;
ing such as to call out peculiar feelings of ad-&#xD;
miration and gratitude. 11er kindness in de-&#xD;
fending him ; her ingenuity in selccing a hid-&#xD;
ing-place ; her .fficiency in effecting the con-&#xD;
ceahnent, and per fortitude in rfusing to be-&#xD;
tray him, were items most thoroughly remnem-&#xD;
bored and appreceiated. 'Ihis: ght I had risen&#xD;
from the 'metboerity of common feminine lhu-&#xD;
matnity .to the very st.mnmit of hiroism and un-&#xD;
selfishness.  Clar ewas beaut iful. Ier I roan,&#xD;
crispy hair ; her soft yet lustrous eyes, and a&#xD;
pretty mouth, expressive alile of thought and&#xD;
refinement, were not things to pass unnoticed&#xD;
and inadmired.&#xD;
The mountaii- man, the pupil aind compan-&#xD;

20          MOUNTAIN MAX; OR, NICK WHIFFLES ON THE BORDER.&#xD;
Nick Whifes, who had been out to look after 1 when they met, and she gave them something&#xD;
his horse, unwilling  to trust it to stranger that looked like a bit of white paper. Then&#xD;

scared these gals, and it brought you within dn&#xD;

Robert Kinmouth received the    -per with an&#xD;
unaccountable foreboding, and grew      notably&#xD;
pale the moment lie examined it.  Clari watched&#xD;
every change of his countenance.&#xD;
" I will read it," said Kinriouth, in a sup-&#xD;
pressed tone. "Fairness to Max Bosworth re-&#xD;
quires that the contents be known to him."&#xD;
He read as follows:&#xD;
"GENERAL PRiCE: -As you know, I am secretly the&#xD;
friend of the Confeieracy, and you may always rely on&#xD;
my friendship and fidelity. ."Iincur some riskin writing&#xD;
these lines, but trust that I have managed matters so&#xD;
adroitly, that those around me are entirely ignorant of&#xD;
my sentiments. I have discovered that the person called&#xD;
Mountain Max, a sharpshooter from California recently&#xD;
arrived, is lurking about in the woods two or three miles&#xD;
above here, waiting for one Nick Whiffles, who is daily&#xD;
expected, at the head of a band of Union desperadoes,&#xD;
from the mountains. I think that Alick Harker, with&#xD;
some of his bushwhackers..might easily surprise and&#xD;
capture this fellow, Max, who is reported to be particu-&#xD;
larly daring and dangerous. Tie quicker these pestilent&#xD;
Unionists are exterminated, the better. I've no doubt,&#xD;
general, but you will soon free Missouri from Yankee&#xD;
rule. My husband, I regret to say, sympathizes with&#xD;
the Northern fanatics ; but I trust that my loyalty will&#xD;
be sufficient to save him from the halter. Tear this into&#xD;
a thousand pieces as soon as read. I have disguised my&#xD;
hand; but some people, you know, have sharp eyes, and&#xD;
I would not be unveiled until I have done the Confedera-&#xD;
cy essentialservice.  Yours for Southern rights,&#xD;
"A FRENaD."&#xD;
In a posteript was added:&#xD;
"Tell your people to respect the life and property of&#xD;
ely husband. At heart, he is really a good man; and I&#xD;
wouldn't have him hanged for the world !"&#xD;
"_A  kied' and considerate soul, whomsoever&#xD;
she may be !" said Nick, dryly.&#xD;
.    nuouths did not stir ; he continued to gaze&#xD;
at the paper.&#xD;
" Let me see it," faltered Kitty.&#xD;
" No," answered Kinmouth, quickly, "it is&#xD;
not necessary."&#xD;
Clari continued to observe her father, but did&#xD;
not speak. A painful silence ensued. Max wan&#xD;
mystified ; -but there was a quiet gleam of in&#xD;
telligence in Nick's eyes.&#xD;
"Father ?" said Kitty, persuasively, holding&#xD;
out her hand.'&#xD;
"I tell you, No !" said her father, with stern&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
"I never knew him to be so cross," sighe&#xD;
Kitty, nestling to Clari.&#xD;
"Snub your cur'osity, little woman," quoth&#xD;
Nick.   " Cnr'osity is a bad thing     in  gals&#xD;
'You've got the pith on't, and what's the good o&#xD;
I okin'?  Writin' is writin', and it can't be n&#xD;
Snore nor les snor that.".   ,            -&#xD;
"I heave a dreadfu -suspicion," nihispere&#xD;
Kitty to Clari. "Dear Clari, do say somethigue&#xD;
Bay that somebody you know is good and trot&#xD;
and the friend of all."~-&#xD;
" All that you wish, dear," murmured Clari.&#xD;
&#xD;
"And yet thue truth is truth, and must be met&#xD;
sometime," responded Kitty, with a shiver of&#xD;
terror.&#xD;
"Hush ! Mother has returned. I hear her&#xD;
voice without. She is giving oilers to the serv-&#xD;
ant about the care of her horse," said Clar,&#xD;
with a nervous start.&#xD;
Kinsmouth crushed the paper in his hand, and&#xD;
thrust it into his pocket. The door was opened,&#xD;
and a fine-looking woman entered, followed by&#xD;
a-stout negro. The lady was Mrs. Kiunmouth,&#xD;
and her black attendant was the boy called&#xD;
Splayfoot.  The skirts of her riding-habit were&#xD;
gathered up gracefully in her left hand, while&#xD;
in the right she carried an elegant riding-switch.&#xD;
She paused near the threshold, cast a quick and&#xD;
penetrating glance at every face ; then, with re-&#xD;
markable self-possession, naade a very becoming&#xD;
obeisance to the company. Each crsbun  ica-&#xD;
cut mutely acknowledged a conmmannding mind,&#xD;
and a brilliant and iacnmating woman. Kim-&#xD;
moutt felt his heart beating hard against its&#xD;
mortal boundaries. his love struggled with Lit&#xD;
pride and his honor. Pretty and graceful w orI-&#xD;
en have certain immunities-a tacitly-rendered&#xD;
courtesy and allegiance. . Open-handed numaal-&#xD;
hood gives it spontaneously and without grudg-&#xD;
ing; and Mrs..Kinmoutli enjoyed a monmenary&#xD;
triumph, though intuitively conscious that som.-&#xD;

to save father, and relieve Clari from her&#xD;
dreadful embarrassment."&#xD;
Mrs. Kinmounth wias now sotnewhrat pale. She&#xD;
listened to Kitty's words with earnest attention.&#xD;
"He acted splendidly, Mountain Max did !&#xD;
He sprang toward lather, whom they had placed&#xD;
in the window, ready to push out"-Kitty&#xD;
shuddered-" drew him away from the danger,&#xD;
and knocked one of the men who was holding&#xD;
him, right through the window."&#xD;
The fair narrator stepped, and recalled her&#xD;
,father's instructions.!&#xD;
" What happened then ?" queried Mrs. Kin-&#xD;
mouth, compressing lier lips.&#xD;
"So lie saved father's life," added Kitty.&#xD;
"And what became of this Max ?"   ,&#xD;
" They tool; him away," replied Kitty, won-&#xD;
dering at her own powers of dissimulation."&#xD;
"The Secessionists took him away. And about&#xD;
that time the men below game, but not soon&#xD;
enough to do any good.".&#xD;
"Bosworth and that keen-eyed man in buck-&#xD;
skin ?"e&#xD;
Yes," sail Kitty.&#xD;
"Strange that a man should have the same&#xD;
name as his horse !" said Mrs. Kinmouth, mus-&#xD;
ingly.&#xD;
"Same name as his horse?" repeated Kitty,&#xD;
coloring consciously.&#xD;
"As I passed the tables just now, I saw a&#xD;
strange horse, covered with a red blanket, on&#xD;
which was painted, in black letters, the name&#xD;
'Swingfoot'.  Now, was that the man's name&#xD;
or the horse's name ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Kinmouth got Kitty's eyes under hex's,&#xD;
and held them steadily.&#xD;
"I should think so," murmured Kitty, rather&#xD;
irrelevantly. "Father introduced him, you&#xD;
know ? Father wouldn't have introduced him,&#xD;
you know -"&#xD;
Kitty took ler eyes away suddenly, and let&#xD;
theim droop to her mother's chin.&#xD;
"You never will be able to tell-lies ingenuously,&#xD;
my.poor little girl !" said Mrs. Kinmouth, with&#xD;
a sigh. " Just under the word 'Swingfoot',"&#xD;
she went on. "were the initials 'N. W.'"&#xD;
" 'N. W.' I" murmured Kitty, with hot cheeks.,&#xD;
"Perhaps it means North West."&#xD;
" Or New World, or Night Walker ." added&#xD;
Mrs. Kinmouth, mockingly. "Or, more proba-&#xD;
bly, Not Warranted 1 It cannot mean Nick&#xD;
Whriffies "&#xD;
Mrs. Kinmouth laughed, but it was a troubled&#xD;
laughs.&#xD;
Kitty showed guilt, and with a downward&#xD;
glance, expressed the opinion that " Not War-&#xD;
ranted" hooked reasonable.-&#xD;
"Catharine Kinmouth, stop equivocating!"&#xD;
said the mother, sharply.  " What does it&#xD;
suffice. You are but a jointed doll in my&#xD;
hands. I can take you all apart in a minute !"-&#xD;
i And hput me together again, I suppose,"&#xD;
sighed the gil.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Come, my child, be frank," continued Mrs.&#xD;
Kinniouth, with most winning tenderness of&#xD;
manner. "You have done your duty to your&#xD;
father, although your blushing falsehoods fall&#xD;
harmless at my feet. You are an honest, single.&#xD;
minded, well-meaning girl, and nothing b't&#xD;
simple truth sits easily on you. I wish you&#xD;
could intrigue a little ; that von had iore art,&#xD;
and were more of'my mode of thinking. Poli-&#xD;
tics don't seem to get into your head at all; or,&#xD;
if they do, they get in at the wrong side. Re.&#xD;
billion is the thing for us, my dear. With&#xD;
rebellion comes war, and war, though terrible&#xD;
in some respects,-is brilliant with -heroia deeds&#xD;
and gilded with history. The Confederacy is&#xD;
'War'. Let it come ! 'Those who survive it&#xD;
will have tales to tell. The South has cast off&#xD;
her allegiance to the Constitution, and will&#xD;
never go back to its bondage again.    The&#xD;
Federal power will be shaken and overthrown!,&#xD;
Mrs. Kinmouth spoke in a grave and earnest&#xD;
fashion. Kittyiregarded her with awe.&#xD;
" I wish you ha the courage," the lady went&#xD;
on, presently, "to help me."&#xD;
" In what way, mother ?" Kitty asked.&#xD;
"By carrying a certain message to a certain&#xD;
place."&#xD;
The girl instantly thought of the letter she&#xD;
had seen, and became very pale.&#xD;
"What! terrified already ?' exclaimed Mrs.&#xD;
Kinmouth, with a toss of contempt.&#xD;
" We ought to be careful what we do," ob.&#xD;
served the daughter, significantly.&#xD;
" Of course, we ought ! Iy am suspected, I&#xD;
suppose ? There was -a certain awkwardness&#xD;
upon you all as I came in. I felt it immediate-&#xD;
ly. I. am  not to be deceived, Catherine.  I&#xD;
shall be watched in future. I cannot go out&#xD;
again to-night, therefore, I must.evyenrasiy&#xD;
messenger ; and you=shall be that messenger."&#xD;
"I ?" exclaimed Kitty, thoroughly surprised.&#xD;
"You, ' my little girl," said her mother,&#xD;
quietly.&#xD;
" Leave the house at this time of night ?&#xD;
^You cannot mean it! I have not a particle of&#xD;
courage, and never had.".' Kitty looked at Mrs.&#xD;
-Kinmouth with dilated eyes.&#xD;
" You have courage, puss, but don't know it,"&#xD;
she said, with insinuating tenderar - toying&#xD;
with'the-girl's hair.&#xD;
The latter shook her Tead.&#xD;
."At your mother's bidding, you will be brave&#xD;
as the bravest. We have always been good&#xD;
friends, Kitty. I have never claimed authority&#xD;
over you, but that of love. -I am sure you will&#xD;
not refuse to comply with a request that con-&#xD;
cerns my personal safety. You would not care&#xD;
to see me harmed."&#xD;
Mrs. Kinmouth's splendid eyes beamed elo-&#xD;
quently upon her daughter. Kitty raised her&#xD;

and affectionately. She rendered silent hoinage&#xD;

" My errand is done, ' answered Kitty, " and&#xD;
I must return.'".&#xD;
"It is not lischt enough to read this little&#xD;

in his pocket, " but I dare say it will keep till&#xD;

it. If there were mure ladies of your zeal and&#xD;
energy, our cause would not latnguiish. Though&#xD;
personally a stranger to yon, your name is quite&#xD;

younger than I had expected ; although you&#xD;
were described in the mst flattering manner&#xD;

Kitty was embarrassed, but said nothing. In&#xD;

was now placed ina position that sip lad not&#xD;
counted on. She thought of heryouthful face,&#xD;
and regretted that site had not come vsailed.&#xD;

The officer bowed in a courtly and respectfslk&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
Kitty was prudently mute ; but she heard his&#xD;
testimony  concerning  the Kinmouths with&#xD;
strange eagerness.&#xD;
" General Price, he resumed, has spoken in&#xD;
the highest terms of your services. ' Mrs. Kin.&#xD;

will stop at nothing. She hates Yankees, and&#xD;

" Very young, indeed !" thought Kit tv, whose&#xD;
attentive ears more than redeemed her silent&#xD;
tongue.&#xD;
" The other Kinmouths are different," lie went&#xD;
on, with the air of one who was conscious that&#xD;
his auditor knew all and more than he knew&#xD;
about it, and would ieeeive with ' porrect com-&#xD;

Kitty shuddered. What a revelation was this!&#xD;
" Then, there is Miss Kinmouth. I wish we&#xD;
could lve had her. She. is said to be a young&#xD;
lady of character; but, unluckily, it is on the- .&#xD;

Kitty                                      She resolved that the man she knew by the&#xD;
'JBeware of your fascinating motherI"   simple name of Bosworth, should feel and own&#xD;
Long before the return of Nick, she was her power; acknowledge her supremacy, and&#xD;
several times on the point of knocking at her bow tober will. She watched Clari, and she&#xD;

.' ep:-ersed him to remain with them  a few&#xD;
di'. She owned it wis selfish, because in such&#xD;
ia iscubed state of affairs his presence would&#xD;
he really a protection, to say nothing of his&#xD;
comn pany and his amusing adventures.&#xD;
Whiffles received these courtesies with un-&#xD;
shaken equanimity. He replied readily, yet so&#xD;
ambiguously that even the quick-witted Mrs.&#xD;
Kinmiouth was led into a state of doubt in re-&#xD;
gard to his real character. At pne moment&#xD;
she uns inclined to think him a simple-minded&#xD;
man of the woods, and at the next, a cool and&#xD;
skiliful person, ever on his guard and ever ens-&#xD;
picious.&#xD;
'Terrible things happen now-a-days," said&#xD;
Mrs. Kinmouth, with a sigh. .I slept none&#xD;
for thinking of the frightful visitors of last&#xD;
unght."&#xD;
Mr. Kinmouth moved uneasily in his chair.&#xD;
He said not a word; he gave no sign of dis-&#xD;
trust. He looked at Clari and Kitty, and sipped&#xD;
his coffee.&#xD;
" Kitty has told me about it," Mrs. Kinmouth&#xD;
resumed, calling to her aid all tihe powers of her&#xD;
will. " You and your friend," addressing Max,&#xD;
" came very opportunely; I may say, provi-&#xD;
dentially. They took away the unfortunate&#xD;
fugitive, did they? I wish you could have&#xD;
saved him, too."'&#xD;
Max looked uip with a start of surprise ; then&#xD;
he remembered that he hal been introduced as&#xD;
Mr. Boswort,, and not as Mountain nMax; and&#xD;
that he was, by common consent, sustaining a&#xD;
false character. A deception bad been put&#xD;
upon Mrs. Kinimouth for his safety, and as a&#xD;
piece of pardonable policy. The man whom&#xD;
she had betrayed was sitting at her table, and&#xD;
she was talking with him freely and easily,&#xD;
pleased with hin, and anxious in turn to please.&#xD;
Thie situation was certainly peculiar. Clan and&#xD;
itty, and indeed all but the subject of the de-&#xD;
ception, felt the strangeness of it. -&#xD;
What .was to be done ? Nothing, of course,&#xD;
on the hart of any member of the family but&#xD;
the careful head of it, Robert Kinmouth, and&#xD;
he was yet in doubt 'wnat, curse to pursue in&#xD;
the future. For the present, and until he could&#xD;
shape out a settled lne of conduct, he was sat-&#xD;
isfied to let matters remain as they were, and&#xD;
take, whatever policy circumstances might give&#xD;
them. Ile felt-sure of his wife's guilt, but, still&#xD;
hadjless R#oof of it thpia he vished. The-letter&#xD;
helhd seen-, though bearing so strong a reten-&#xD;
blance to her handwriting, might possibly be&#xD;
made toappear an ingenious forgery. Yes;&#xD;
there might, be a faint" ho    of that. So Mr.&#xD;
IKinmouthclung to straws1 and resolved to be&#xD;
magna:iimious aid slow to condemn ; while, at&#xD;
the same time, he feared there was no hope of&#xD;
heat innocencee being shown. But lie had no,&#xD;
heart to mate a sudden exposure. The thought&#xD;
of cnfi rmation stattled him. Ile preferred&#xD;
b   lt oif the evil day, whem, to the minds of&#xD;
&#xD;
some others, the whole truth was as clear n&#xD;
sunlight.&#xD;
This was the status of affairs'at the house on&#xD;
the Bluff on the mnot niig after the visit of the&#xD;
bishwhackers.&#xD;
Mrs. Kinmouth kept a vigilant watch that&#xD;
day. She knew she was standing on slippery&#xD;
ground, but would, make the best of it. Clar  4&#xD;
was quiet and coldJ; while Kitty was inexplica-&#xD;
ble. The latter had evidently got an idea into&#xD;
her head, but her wise mother could not de-&#xD;
termine whlat it was.&#xD;
Max Bosworth walked about the grounds&#xD;
with her husband, and talked seriously with&#xD;
him. Of course, the subject concerned the Re-&#xD;
bellion, and the difficulties that surrounded&#xD;
loyal people.&#xD;
Nick Whiffles-they called him Swingfoot-&#xD;
related a few comical stories, and with his rifle&#xD;
on his shoulder, disappeared. Mrs. Kinmouth&#xD;
watched his tall figure down the Bluff road,&#xD;
and slightly contracting ber fair brow, muttered&#xD;
to herself:&#xD;
" He will come to-night. He has left his&#xD;
horse."&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
TIrE MOUNTAIN MEN.-&#xD;
Nick Whiffies did not follow the road far.&#xD;
He struck off into the Forest. le walked rap-&#xD;
idly, but his mocecasined feet made little noise ;&#xD;
not because he made particular effort to go&#xD;
softly, but more from habit. .le heard the dry&#xD;
leaves rustle under the pressure of heavy feet.&#xD;
He stopped, and stood behind a tree. After a&#xD;
short time he saw a miian hurrying through the&#xD;
woods toward the river.. Ile passed quite near&#xD;
Nick, who recognized him. - It was Alick Har-&#xD;
ker.&#xD;
" I wonder where the critter's going' ?" mused&#xD;
Nick. " On no very good arrant. I'll warrant.&#xD;
There'll be a cussed little diflikilty, I allow,&#xD;
sooner or later!"&#xD;
He did not st'r, but continued to look after&#xD;
Aliek. Presenitly, he saw another figure, smaller,&#xD;
and moving silently. It was Archittald Roe,&#xD;
following the buslhwhacker. A smile of satis-&#xD;
fact on passed over the old trapper's lips. He&#xD;
watched the youth till he was out of sight.&#xD;
"The boy has a light step and a steady eye,"&#xD;
he said, tvith a. pleased iir. " lied soon l'arn&#xD;

a tiger, anti the cunning of a cat. That mean&#xD;
secession skunk~l have to ito faster nolr he dots&#xD;
now, to get out the way o' that-youngster."&#xD;
NWith this audible expression of his thoughts,&#xD;
Nick   n9ved on bui-klv.   Ile went far, and&#xD;
through lonely plae s his only guide seemed&#xD;
to be his itnitive sense of the points of the&#xD;
compass. Whatever faculty or curious knowl-&#xD;
edge directed his conree, .lie did not err, but&#xD;
went straight to the spot he wished to find;&#xD;

" You did not ?" shie repeated, eyeing Kitty&#xD;

Kitty spoke earnestly. , lher mother had&#xD;
never seen her so firm, s, fearless before. She&#xD;
shivered and drew lack, like one who looks. off&#xD;
a dizzy height. She began to feel her peril.&#xD;

"Clhri is ltandsome," said Kitty, absently.&#xD;
"' Yes, sielied te' mother, ' 1 fear site is."&#xD;
This was murm ured rather tlhan spoken. She&#xD;
was greatly troubled hlv what Kitty had said.&#xD;
Shle was the victim of suspense and fear. That&#xD;
a discovery of some kind had been made. she&#xD;
could itot doubt. But what was it?    How&#xD;
much was site compromtised, and to whom?&#xD;
Bosworth and Clari came up. and she joined&#xD;

hemtrt was beating ptifully&#xD;

Kiynmouth. "A very good idea. This Swing-&#xD;

" ie ~has come to us at the right time," o-&#xD;
served Clari.' ' I hope he will be able to hold&#xD;
thd' bushwhackers in eheek.  We call these&#xD;
midnight prowlers, bushwhackers, Mr. Bos-&#xD;

"I will, trust the trapper and his mountain-&#xD;

worth. ' " These miie do not waste powder&#xD;

.   Yon are on the right side, I see," said Mrs.&#xD;
Kitimouth yravely,&#xD;
' I hope so, umtdam. I'm on the side of the&#xD;
Governrient and Liberty."&#xD;
" Do Von intend to take arms in the defence&#xD;
of the Union ?" asked the lady. quietly.&#xD;
Bivpworth received a warning glance from&#xD;
Ritt.yI He took the l;nt. and gave a different&#xD;
reply from What Ie taid intended,&#xD;
Sticks a thought has been i my mind, I&#xD;
confess," ie said ; " but I.shall be guided by&#xD;
reason and my calmest judgment. What should&#xD;
you advise. iadam?"&#xD;
This qluest ion took Mrs. Kinmoutht somewhat&#xD;
off her guard ; but she was not one to be long&#xD;
emibarr:assed.&#xD;
" Precisely what you have said you would be&#xD;
guided by," she replied.  I conttnend your&#xD;
moderationt. Many are hasty.  Haste is not&#xD;
always expedient. One should think twice be-&#xD;
fore taking an important step. There are two&#xD;
sides to every question."&#xD;
" And we cannot take both of them," inter-&#xD;
posed Kitty.&#xD;
Mrs. Kinmcuth tossed her head and laughed.&#xD;
What a' wise 1buss!  She is becoming a&#xD;
sagely"&#xD;
"The young lady is right," said Bosworth,&#xD;
with a smile. "The country has but two par-&#xD;
ties-its friends and its enemies. great , indeed,&#xD;
are our responsibilities.  We are accountable&#xD;
to all the future."&#xD;
Mrs. Kiniouth turned toward Kitty, and&#xD;
her red lips curled with incredulity. She be-&#xD;
lieved in the Confederacy.&#xD;
"Do you like Yankees?" she asked, with af-&#xD;
feeted good-tature.&#xD;
" No," said Bosworth, dryly ; " I like Amer.&#xD;
icans."&#xD;
Mrs. ICinmouth looked serious, and said&#xD;
Let-us go to dinner."          ..    .&#xD;
So they went in, with a wide, wide difference&#xD;
of thought between them.&#xD;

rebel lady his smile was a grimace, and thq&#xD;
tender glance of his eye anr ugly Jeer.&#xD;
This is no time for jesting, Mr.' Harker,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Kinrmouth, dry'ly.&#xD;
" I swear i'm in earnest!" protested Harker.&#xD;
You are more bewitching than your girls.&#xD;
I'll hang Kinmouth. Dam ned if I don't!-'&#xD;
He threw his arm about Mr's. Kinmouth's&#xD;
waist. She disengaged herself iii an instant.&#xD;
 You are a fool, Aick I" said she. " You'vo&#xD;
been drinking whisky. Be thankful if 1 don't&#xD;
report you."&#xD;
Report me ! You won't be so cruel," said&#xD;
the ruffian, in a wheedling tone, still continuing&#xD;
his advances.&#xD;
"Go and get sober! exclaimed Mrs. Kin-&#xD;
mouth, angrily, and string him   upon the&#xD;
mouth with her hand, sire turned and ran toward&#xD;
home as fast as she could.   Aliek staggered&#xD;
after her a few steps, ran against t tree, stopped,&#xD;

" For that I'll make you suffer, uiy lady&#xD;
I'll persecute your daughters; and    your&#xD;
husband don't come to grief, it'll be through no&#xD;
fault of mine.''&#xD;
Meantime, Nick waited for Archibald Roe.&#xD;
He did not allow his anxiety to be apparent.&#xD;
He became uncommonly communicative. He&#xD;
talked  continuously to the girls.  Ile told&#xD;
stories of his uncles and aunts ; and was never&#xD;

facetiousness.&#xD;
Mountain Max sat near the trapper, and the&#xD;

"-B.'"&#xD;
-The young girl having read this, understood&#xD;
everything. The whole truth flashed through&#xD;
her mind. She perceived the purport of the&#xD;
letter she had carried. She felt ill-tised and&#xD;
humiliated. At first she was angry with her&#xD;
mother ; but that; feeling was of shob continu-&#xD;
ane ; sorrow cane after it, treading upon its&#xD;
retreating shadow.     "-&#xD;
She handed the wrinkled scrap of paper&#xD;
quietly and sadly to  Niek.  The latter had&#xD;
good eyes ; lie glanced compassionately at the&#xD;
girl, then slowly mastered the writing, which&#xD;
was not quite so plain to hin as the trail of a&#xD;
Choctaw. He slipped it into his pocket, say-&#xD;
ing--&#xD;
"Never mind, little woman, never mind! It&#xD;
don't trouble me an attom. All these things is&#xD;
in our lifetime. Brighten up!  A heap o' good&#xD;
may come out on't. You wanted me to mount&#xD;
Swingfoot and be, off, thinkin' I'd;be taken on-&#xD;
awares. Now that was kind in ye, and marci-&#xD;
ful, as 'twere; but you see I weren't onperpared&#xD;
for s'prises., 0 Lord, no!"&#xD;
During this time, Kiamouth and Bosworth&#xD;
were earnestly engaged in conversation ; but&#xD;
Clari was left to amuse herself, which she did&#xD;
by watching Kitty and trying to penetrate this&#xD;
by-play. She thought she perceived that some&#xD;
secret matter was behig canvassed ; but she&#xD;
had so much faith in her sister, that she was&#xD;
sure of knowing all she ought to, in due time.&#xD;
Max left his host and joined the little circle.&#xD;
"I've got the details, my boy," said Nick.&#xD;
r--   W   ebg afeard o' the gal; she's in the ring,&#xD;
now, and knows as much about it as I do. I'd&#xD;
kept her out, on account of her feelin's ; but&#xD;
she's rayther breachy, and in   she jumped!&#xD;
Nick looked at her so kindly, that she began to&#xD;
love hn. He put his brown hand on herbrown-&#xD;
er curls. " She's a Unioner, Max, true Union-&#xD;
er. Her good mamma will come round right,&#xD;
one o' these days."&#xD;
"Don't make me like you !" murmured Kit-&#xD;
ty, gratefully. -" I don't want to like'anybody."&#xD;
"Sooner or later, by-and-by, now or then, in&#xD;
the course o' natur, in the happenin' of car-&#xD;
eumstances, there's one as you'll come to like ;&#xD;
and the'naine o' that one shall not be herein&#xD;
mentioned by me. 0 Lord ! no. Not what.&#xD;
somer.   Not by   no  outspoken language o&#xD;
mine, although my nat'ral eyes has been on&#xD;
that individooal, and seen all the treasures of&#xD;
iris love for somebody; which somebody may&#xD;
be a thousand miles from here, for anything I&#xD;
shall say to the contrary."&#xD;
&#xD;
63&#xD;
&#xD;
Guilty or not guilty, Kitty's eyes drooped.&#xD;
Her long lashes quivered, opened, shut, and her&#xD;
cheeks flushed strangely. She did not really&#xD;
seem to know what caused her perturbation.&#xD;
Archie had produced from some depository&#xD;
on his person, a card of recently-stabbed bugs,&#xD;
that were yet writhing on their respective pins.&#xD;
Their feeble wings fluttered in the pains of&#xD;
crucifixion. Hearing Nick go on in this way,&#xD;
the card slipped from his fingers, and dropped&#xD;
at Kitty's feet.&#xD;
The mountain-man drew up his shoulders,&#xD;
and the smile that came to hiscomical lips&#xD;
was as pleasant as a woman's.&#xD;
"What a condemned: world 'tis!" lie mut-&#xD;
tered. "There's diffikilties in't, but the diffi-&#xD;
kilties git straightened o'ut, arter a while. There&#xD;
wasn't never nothin' so crooked that it couldn't&#xD;
be straightened. You can look through prov-&#xD;
idence like the double sights of a gun, if you&#xD;
only know how to lay your face to't. Don't let&#xD;
nobody's heart be troubled.'&#xD;
Nick stopped. '"Matters are workia'," he&#xD;
added, nodding to Bosworth. "The sbush-&#xD;
whackers are cousin' to take us, presently.&#xD;
Prehaps they'll have an easy time on't, my&#xD;
son !"&#xD;
Kitty Kinmouth stood staring.at the moun-&#xD;
taineer. She wanted to be angry, but she&#xD;
didn't know whom to be angry with, nor what&#xD;
about; so she gave it up, and pouted.&#xD;
Max found opportunity to glance from her&#xD;
to Clari.&#xD;
"You don't act like one as is to be hanged at&#xD;
three o'clock," said Nick, with quiet humer.&#xD;
" Instead o' perparin' to leave the airth, you&#xD;
seem to be fixim' your mind more on't." Then&#xD;
to Kitty: " Come, little woman, take your sis-&#xD;
ter and leave us. Don't borrer no trouble.&#xD;
Sleep as peacefully as if there weren't a bush-&#xD;
whacker within a hundred miles."&#xD;
"We'll go," answered Kitty, " but not to&#xD;
sleep. We won't sleep while our defenders&#xD;
watch. Clari is brave. You can trust Clari&#xD;
and I. She shall know all. I hope you won't&#xD;
allow yourselves to be taken. I'm sure you&#xD;
won't. Keep as much from him"-she glanced&#xD;
at her father-" as you consistently can. I.&#xD;
don't want him to be shocked ; because her&#xD;
eyes may be opened, you know, and she may,&#xD;
when she sees clearer, regret all this."&#xD;
" My friend understands you," said Max.&#xD;
"Though brave as a lion; he-has a heart like a&#xD;
woman."&#xD;
Kitty bowed gratefully, and, in turning, met&#xD;
the eyes of Archibald Roe. She never had&#xD;
seen them so bright and handsome. They gave&#xD;
her a strange thrill-a sensation divided be-&#xD;
tween pleasure and pain.&#xD;
The girls left the room together, and the eyes&#xD;
of two persons followed them with adoration.&#xD;

herself very prettily in her easy-chair.&#xD;
' A heavy, firm step cate up, and the form of&#xD;
Sosworth presently darkened her door. -He&#xD;
bowed, and looked it her. His expression was&#xD;
" Madam, you have sent for me.    What do&#xD;
You wish ?"&#xD;
Come in, Mr. Bosworth. Excuse me for send-,&#xD;

Max. " A woman's wishes I htave always re-&#xD;

There was a'touch of severity, the lady&#xD;
hittuglt, in his voice.&#xD;
"zWe had better come at the truth at once,"&#xD;
she said. "I aim aware that you are the person&#xD;

They were like Claris, but more fiery.&#xD;
You are right," answered Max, thrilled by&#xD;
the beauty of the woman. "I wish to live a&#xD;

He was thinking of Clari when hue said that.&#xD;

you's to shake 'em, I allow I could hear the&#xD;
whisky swash."&#xD;
" No more holler nor your'n !" said Black-&#xD;
mser, with a grin. "But I do, hold a right&#xD;
sirt sprinklin' o' rum, mister."  The colonel&#xD;
cast his eyes incidentally to the door, and be-&#xD;
hel.1 a sight that thrilled and exhilarated him&#xD;
more than the last installment of whisky. It&#xD;
was the incomparable Kitty herself.&#xD;
The Confederate for an instant forgot his dis-&#xD;
iguise. He-nustered into service all his blan-&#xD;
dishmerits. He smiled and bowed without the&#xD;
least regard to Bart Bramble, or to that per-&#xD;
Son'sn agged coat or filthy face.&#xD;
Kitty was, at first, inclined to laugh at this&#xD;
ridiculous pantomime, but she governed her-&#xD;
seilf, put on a dramatic expression, made an un-&#xD;
certain step forward, and stared at the man&#xD;
with the greatest pertinacity.&#xD;
" Mrs. Kinmouth, I au delighted !"- said the&#xD;
colonel, in a low tone.&#xD;
" I cannot recall your features,' my good&#xD;
man," replied Kitty, gravely.&#xD;
"No wonder!" thought Blackmer, remem-&#xD;
bering how lie was disguised.   My mother&#xD;
wouldn't know inc."&#xD;
'- Your face is-is-"&#xD;
" Yes," said 'Blackmer, thinking she was con-&#xD;
ing at it.&#xD;
"Dirty !" added Kitty, maintaining her se-&#xD;
rionsuess wonderfully.&#xD;
The colonel's hope fell like the stick of an&#xD;
exploded rocket.&#xD;
Nick Whiffle grinned a humorous grin that&#xD;
stretched his comical mouth to' its greatest&#xD;
width.&#xD;
Blackmer swore an inaudible oath. He se.-&#xD;
cretly cursed disguises and situations. Here&#xD;
was a woman whom    he wanted to adore, but&#xD;
could appear to her only as a species of human&#xD;
swine. The question was, how could he reveal&#xD;
himself to her, without making the same reve-&#xD;
lation to Nick, with whom his secret would be&#xD;
less safe. That his Mrs. Kinmouth was quiz.&#xD;
zing him, he could not doubt.&#xD;
" If you please, I will send for some water,"&#xD;
said Kittlf.&#xD;
"I won't trouble you, ma'am," answered&#xD;
Blackmer, quite at his wits' en 1. " Water don't&#xD;
agree i'itli en, either for external or internal&#xD;
use."&#xD;
"'Twould make a prison difflkilty with his&#xD;
stomach, if he should, by any accident, git wa-&#xD;
ter into't," remarked Nick, squinting cunning -&#xD;
ly at Kitty., "But he'll put hisself outside a&#xD;
pint o' whisky quicker'n a telegraph. He's the&#xD;
condemnudest critter on that as ever I see, by&#xD;
mighty ! Them legs o' his'n isn't nothin' but&#xD;
shells, ra'am, They're -holler as coffins inside,&#xD;
and when he tips up a canteen, the old Bourbon&#xD;
runs right into 'ei. There isn't no narrer in&#xD;
his bones."&#xD;
&#xD;
Ridicule was the colonel's vulnerable point.&#xD;
His old Adam   broke out against Nick. He&#xD;
whipped out his revolver again, and on this oe-&#xD;
casion he cocked it. The sharp click terrified&#xD;
the girl, but the mountaineer was not in the&#xD;
least intimidated.&#xD;
" Put it up," quoth Nick. " You'll skeer the&#xD;
lady. °Women folks don't like gunpowder over&#xD;
and above well. If you should fire, you'd never&#xD;
pull trigger ag'in. You'd fall in your'tracks,&#xD;
pierced by a bullet that isn't fur off." -&#xD;
Kitty involuntarily followed the covert direc-&#xD;
tion of Nick's eyes, and saw Archie with his&#xD;
rifle, aiming at Blackmer. The latter also turn-&#xD;
ed, and with a shudder, perceived the fixed and&#xD;
deadly tube covering heis heart. With-a smother-&#xD;
ed imprecation, lie put back his revolver ; while&#xD;
Archie Roe slowly lowered his-weapon.&#xD;
" A singular fool !" he thought, and he could&#xD;
not refrain  from  expressing  the 'thought.&#xD;
" There's method in that young man's mad-&#xD;
ness," he said, frowning. "Are there'any more&#xD;
fools and lunatics in this house ?" Then, think-&#xD;
ing of his divinity, and what politeness requir&#xD;
ed, he added: "1 beg your parding, Mrs. Kin-&#xD;
mouth. I'in sometimes irritable. I'm afeard&#xD;
you don't know me ? Remember the white&#xD;
plume, ma'am."&#xD;
Kitty shook her head, in utter innocence of&#xD;
what lie was talking about.&#xD;
''What 'does this man mean, and why is he&#xD;
here ?" asked Kitty of Nick. "lHe has evi-&#xD;
dently escaped from  some asylum. I think&#xD;
you had better put some restraint upon him,&#xD;
for he is obviously unfit to be at large."&#xD;
"The letter !" whispered Blackmer, edging up&#xD;
to Kitty.&#xD;
"'Don't let him come any nearer, Mr. Swing-&#xD;
foot !" she exclaimed, in affected terror.&#xD;
" The cabin in the wood !" added the colonel,&#xD;
in the same sibillant manner.&#xD;
" Do take hold of him !" persisted Kitty -&#xD;
Nick seized him by the skirt of his ragged.&#xD;
coat, and drew him back,&#xD;
"4 You'd better watch him ti!l morning," she&#xD;
added. " If he offers t: go, shoot him through&#xD;
the head."&#xD;
There was nothing quizzical in her last in-&#xD;
junction ; it was earnest ; it was serious. The&#xD;
disguised man felt it to be so, and began to re-&#xD;
alize that his position was perilous. But there&#xD;
was something in reserve to sustain him. The&#xD;
simple discharge of his pistol would'eall a score&#xD;
of men to his aid. . He abandoned himself to&#xD;
the course of events. He sat down quietly, put&#xD;
his feet on the back of a chair, relapsed fully&#xD;
into his ruffianly character, leered at Nick, and&#xD;
said, with admirable nonchalance&#xD;
" Give us a chaw, Secesh !"&#xD;
Kitty shrugged her shoulders, and disap-&#xD;
peared.   When Blackmer glanced that way&#xD;
agan, the pretty girlish face was not there.&#xD;

gan the sentence again, and miished it.&#xD;
" Btsworth was shot through the arm with&#xD;

"Away with your hypocrisy, Kitty ! Talk&#xD;

Call him Nick Wtiflls.    am tird of false-&#xD;

within twenty-four hours."&#xD;
They seem not to have been deceptions,"&#xD;
said the girl, slowly. " They were not decep-&#xD;
tions to injure people. We deceive sometimes&#xD;
for good. sometimes for evil. But I hate lies,&#xD;
whether acieI, told, or implied.'&#xD;

Mrs. Kiinmsuth sighed, and shook her head&#xD;
sadly. '&#xD;
" Come, let us go down and see more of the&#xD;
beauties of secession. We have had one lessen,&#xD;
vou know?'?&#xD;
Mrs. Kinmouth followed her daughter down&#xD;
stairs, a subject of :anything buteualun thoughts.&#xD;
She was surprised. to find the lower part of the&#xD;
house thronged with- strange ftes ;awn, long-&#xD;
bearded faces. She supposed, at first, that they&#xD;
were bushwhackers, but a second look dis-&#xD;
credited the supposition. They were mountain-&#xD;
men, of the Nick Vhiiffles' type. Was their&#xD;
presence, at a uilIo  so eritieml, the result o.&#xD;
ebtance ? It was difficult to think so.- The web&#xD;
of circumstances wias closing closely about her.&#xD;
She saw thet carrying outsome bIdies. The&#xD;
light casually reveIed their ghastly visages,&#xD;
which startled her. She was shocked at the&#xD;
spectacle of death  Site msked herself if those&#xD;

I have been trifled with and betrayed !" he&#xD;
muttered.  "Madam," he looked at Mrs. Kin-&#xD;
mouth, "you    have played a double game.&#xD;
-There has been damnable treacl ery."&#xD;
The rebel lady was on delicate ground.&#xD;
There was daiiger of an immediate expose of&#xD;
ier conduct. There was need of skilful tactics&#xD;
and rapid movement. She now knew that the&#xD;
tattered nan was Colonel Blackmer, and that&#xD;
it was necessary that she should speak to him.&#xD;
-Stand away, brave fellow!" she said, touch-&#xD;
ing one of the imountait-nen on the shoulder.&#xD;
lie fell lack, and she, passed him  and ap-&#xD;
proachel the colonel. No one interrupted her.&#xD;
tier dignified manner forced respect and immu-&#xD;
nis.y from interference.  She said to Blackmer,&#xD;
in a whisper&#xD;
" Trust me, and I will save you.  Don't be-'&#xD;
tray me ! Call we a vile Lincoluite, and I'll re-&#xD;
tort in character."&#xD;
hope arose from the dead ashes of his de-&#xD;
spair.  He recollected what this woman had&#xD;
done, first and list, and his belie f in her began&#xD;
to return. Possibly it was the false Kitty who&#xD;
had u rought the mischief. He resolved to hate&#xD;
her from that moment, and to act up to the&#xD;
very spitiit of-Mrs. Kinmouth's instructions.&#xD;
As sie was turning from him,-he commenced&#xD;
the hyjocritical lesson.&#xD;
Le. ve me, woman !" lie exclaimed.  " Do&#xD;
not ost 'your venom in my ear. Taunts do not&#xD;
heooie your sex, though they may befit your&#xD;
detestable cause."&#xD;
She gave him a grateful and commendatory&#xD;
look-a look, the meaning of"which flashed on&#xD;
1 in like lightning.  He thought he could feel&#xD;
the firm ground under his feet again.&#xD;
t       Nick mnd Mix stood quietly near. Both were&#xD;
willing that the lady should save herself from&#xD;
the shame and disgrace of a denoucment.  For&#xD;
the sake of her daughters, they hoped she&#xD;
would find some avenue of escape. Bosworth&#xD;
beheld her with emotions of tender compassion.&#xD;
She had flattered him with her preference, and&#xD;
she stood in an interesting relation to Clari.lie&#xD;
admired her spirit and courage ; and, looking&#xD;
at her alit she had whispered to Blackmer,&#xD;
- -nhd lie had retorted, he perceived, with inward&#xD;
satisfaction, that she had proved equal to the&#xD;
ccnsion.&#xD;
Nick smiled knowingly, and Kitty said to her-&#xD;
self:&#xD;
" I will save mother !"&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
NO!&#xD;
Kitty Kinmoutli, although profoundly regret-&#xD;
ting hor mother's wily policy, was yet extreme-&#xD;
ly anxious to shield her from its consequences.&#xD;
11er desire to punish.Blackmner for his audacity&#xD;
and impertinence had hurried her further than&#xD;
was entirely prudent ; -but Mrs. Kinmouth's&#xD;
skill, exhibited at the last moment, had put a&#xD;
&#xD;
hopeful aspect on the affair. Knowing well&#xD;
that Iher mother would need assistance, Kitty&#xD;
followed her to her room.&#xD;
" Which of you is it ?" that lady asked, turn-&#xD;
ing sharply to her daughter.&#xD;
" Wiuch of us is what ?" queried the girl,&#xD;
with more force than grammatical accuracy.&#xD;
"In love with Bosworth I" said Mrs. Kin-&#xD;
mouth.&#xD;
" You, I think," answered Kitty, naively..&#xD;
" I did not mean that," retorted her mother,&#xD;
with considerable embarrassment.  "I ieant&#xD;
you and Clari."&#xD;
" Clara or me !" repeated Kitty.&#xD;
" But I have'eyes," resumed Mrs. Kinmouth,&#xD;
thoughtfully.  "-Why do I ask questions?  I&#xD;
know it is-Clan, for. I have watched her."&#xD;
" Granting it to be Clari, what then ?"&#xD;
" I am in a perilous position," continued the&#xD;
lady, speaking with unusual seriousness. "Those&#xD;
three men below must not be harmed-they&#xD;
must escape."&#xD;
"I see that they must. If they do not, at&#xD;
the last moment they will -betray you.  Did&#xD;
you observe the villain Harker?  His counte-&#xD;
nance kindled at sight of you.. His native au-&#xD;
dacity came back. He expects you to extri-&#xD;
cate him from his present peril," replied- the&#xD;
girl, with equal earnestness.&#xD;
Mrs. Kinmouth involuntarily recalled her&#xD;
nocturnal interview with Harker at the hollow&#xD;
tree.  His insolence had shocked her.  The&#xD;
more she thought of it, the more her pride was&#xD;
wounded. She was mortified to think that such&#xD;
men should be numbered among her friends.&#xD;
11er eyes were beginning to see matters more&#xD;
clearly.&#xD;
" There is not much time to lose," she added,&#xD;
" for the mountaineers are now deliberating,&#xD;
and the fate of the prisoners will soon be de-&#xD;
cided. The captors are likely to be unanimous&#xD;
in their views."&#xD;
4 Remember, mother, how the Secessionists&#xD;
of the Alick Harker stamp have outraged every&#xD;
sense of justice, and put Union men to death,"&#xD;
interp 'sed Kitty. "Recollect what happened&#xD;
here last night!"&#xD;
"It was frightful !" said Mrs. Kinmouth, with&#xD;
a little shiver.  "If the mouttain-men have&#xD;
their way, those three persons will be shot or&#xD;
hanged. We must produce delay, and trust to&#xD;
circumstances. The man called Mountain Max&#xD;
must be influenced. Clari can do that."&#xD;
" Yes," responded Kitty, "Clari can do that&#xD;
-or you either, mother. But Clari is the one,&#xD;
I should think she night wind him round.her&#xD;
finger, Clari is so bewitching !"&#xD;
. Mrs. Kiumouth colored, and breathed hur-&#xD;
riediv.&#xD;
"if Clari can manage to make delay, and get&#xD;
the mea up somewhere in the house, guarded&#xD;
by one or two of Nick's fellows, I believe we&#xD;
can find means to get them  clear.  Let them&#xD;

ster.&#xD;
NoI" responded the youth.&#xD;
" For nyotlier's sake, Archie I" continued Kit-&#xD;
ty, in a winning tone.&#xD;
"NoI" persisted Archibald.&#xD;
"Formy sake, ArehieI"&#xD;
She leaned a little toward him, and her voice&#xD;
was modulated to a softer accent. She took his&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
Mrs. Kinmouth and Clari beheld this scene&#xD;
with increasing curiosity. They wondered that&#xD;
Kitt.y had power to lead the youth out of his&#xD;
toe ital darkness.&#xD;
He did not say " No", but lie shook his head&#xD;
slowly and discouragingly. There was a great&#xD;
"No I" in his thoughts.&#xD;
" I am very sure," resumed Kitty, " that you&#xD;
have skill enough to aid them. I do not ask&#xD;
you to help them, because they are deserving of&#xD;
help, but to prevent certain things that will be&#xD;
t iaagreeable to another."&#xD;
/ Arelibald'sface glowed, and hiseyes sparkled.&#xD;
"'It is too late to tillnl of that," lie said, with&#xD;
sudden fierceness. "Many people have felt dis-&#xD;
agreeable. The mnca Alick Harker and his&#xD;
iushwhackers have hanged, felt disagreeable I&#xD;
Death- in ainy form, is disagreeable. Cdr. Kin&#xD;
mouth felt disagreeable, twenty-four hours ago,&#xD;
with a rope around his neck, and the ruffians&#xD;
ready to push him front the window. And the&#xD;
nian in the wall!' How felt he ?"&#xD;
He -raised his arm and pointed at Mrs. Kin&#xD;
mouth while lie was speaking. That lady grew&#xD;
very pale, and muttered, half aloud&#xD;
a 6 "This young man is not mad; if he is, it ii&#xD;
-  strange madness."&#xD;
AThose who enter upon a long road, and&#xD;
walk in it, ought to know where it leads," added&#xD;
.Arabibald, in the same tone. " Those who be&#xD;
tray, must, in turn, suffer betrayal. Gooi men&#xD;
die deaths fit only for mangy curs; and whc&#xD;
grieves for it?  Not the bushwhaokcrs ; not the&#xD;
&#xD;
the men in gray ; not those who ride nights to&#xD;
carry letters fill of destruction."&#xD;
Kitty's-color caine and weit. She involunta-&#xD;
rily shrank from Archibald Roe. She thought&#xD;
of her midnight journey. Never did she feel so&#xD;
guilty, and never did the youth look so -noble&#xD;
and so handsome.&#xD;
Mrs. Kinmouth sj)rang from her chair, sent&#xD;
some swift and terrified glances at him, trem-&#xD;
bled, and sat down again. She was greatly&#xD;
troubled. Various emotions shook her firm-&#xD;
ness. Suspense and self-condemnation tortured&#xD;
her. She silently clasped her hands, and wish-&#xD;
ed she was like Clari or Kitty-loyal at soul.&#xD;
Clari, though still laboring under surprise,&#xD;
gazed at Archibald with a calm, lofty, and ap-&#xD;
proving expression. She thought she could see&#xD;
the flitting figure of Love standing ,between&#xD;
Kitty and Archibald Roe. To her seeing, the&#xD;
youiig god smiled on both, and she marveled at&#xD;
her past blindness.&#xD;
" I told mother." said Kitty, coldly, "that I&#xD;
could xely on you."&#xD;
" So you can," lie answered, "for anything&#xD;
that is right, but not to save traitors and assas-&#xD;
sins. I know what you. fear. I ,ani well ac-&#xD;
quamited with the strong motive that impels&#xD;
you to make a request so much at variance with&#xD;
your character. The motive takes away the&#xD;
criminality of the intention ; and the intention&#xD;
itself falls to the ground a hopeless thing. If I&#xD;
were willing to risk my life, how could I save&#xD;
these men? Can I ascend to the roof, remove&#xD;
shingles and boards, and take the prisoners out?&#xD;
Can I go below and engineer through the floor,&#xD;
with a dozen mountaineers sleeping within a&#xD;
few feet of me?  You see how impossible it is.&#xD;
Aliek Harker and his two friends must help&#xD;
themselves, for I cannot."&#xD;
f   " We can drug the men at the door I" said&#xD;
Mrs. Kinmouth, in a suppressed voi""&#xD;
"You may do that," replied Arbt wit&amp;amp;&#xD;
troubled look "I will not! But I will be&#xD;
silent. For the sake of Kitty, and. Clar, and&#xD;
you, I will be silent. Do what you will, and&#xD;
fear .nothing from inc."&#xD;
"I, for one," interposed Clan, "hold you&#xD;
blameless."&#xD;
Kitty said nothing, but glanced at Archie and&#xD;
sighed.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
NICK VISITS iRS. KIgMOIITH.&#xD;
There was a heavy step in the upper hall, and&#xD;
immediately some one knocked. -Clari opened&#xD;
the door, and saw the tall figure of Nick Whiffles.&#xD;
lHe crossed the threshold, and handed a scrap of&#xD;
paper to Mrs. Kinmouth.   On it .was written&#xD;
these words, in pencil:&#xD;
"MRs. KiNMOUTH :-Aliek Tarker sayshe must see yo-&#xD;
He is very urgent, and it will not be safe to refuse him.&#xD;
If these lines should reach you, de not tail to come t&#xD;
e us.           ,'                 BIAOKME."&#xD;
&#xD;
I.&#xD;
&#xD;
MOUNTAIN MAX; OR, NICK WHIFFLE3 ON THE BORDER.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs.. Kinmoth read it very quickly, then&#xD;
passed It to K, t:. ~&#xD;
"Did roe read it, Mr. Whiffles ?" Mrs. Kin-&#xD;
inoutl asked..&#xD;
"Not a word,"    Nick answered.    " It was&#xD;
thrust under the door, and the prisoners begged&#xD;
that it might be given to yon.  'hle favor was&#xD;
so triihii', andi I hey was so amirnest, that I pichetl&#xD;
it mup and brought it. Tem ma hiave'n't long to&#xD;
live sloii lIhe 'humored, when it eaa bedone&#xD;
without n uel Itrouble."&#xD;
Mrs. K11   ihte  reflected. She took the pa-&#xD;
per from Katy, and giving it to Nick, said&#xD;
" Read'it."&#xD;
He r. ad it ; but rather slowly, on account of&#xD;
the diminess'of the'lines.&#xD;
Do you want to see this Alick Harker ?" lie&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"No," replied Mrs. Kinmouth ; " I don't wise'&#xD;
to see him, unless-"&#xD;
"1Uniess what ?" queried Nick.&#xD;
The lady's eyes se.trcel Nick's thoughts be-&#xD;
fore she replied. Site believed it would be use-&#xD;
.less -to say what she at first intended, and sle&#xD;
discreetly answered :&#xD;
.'"No matter. The fanicy is past. I perceive&#xD;
that you are determined. Two of those men&#xD;
will suffer. Why should I trouble mysblf about&#xD;
them? . 1 uvill tell you: I have a natural repug-&#xD;
nance to deeds of violence."&#xD;
I know it," quoth Nick, dryly.      " You&#xD;
wouldn't have nobody hanged for the world&#xD;
especially the worthy Kinhmouth. 0 Lord, no!"&#xD;
Mrs. Kiimiouthm's heart gave a    frightened&#xD;
thump against its fleshly bars. Soni of that&#xD;
sounded like a quotitionfron one of lier letters.&#xD;
Nick, intentionally, or otherwise, had touched&#xD;
her in a sensitive spot.&#xD;
Kitty blushed. Clari looked grave. Archie&#xD;
m91'4    earer to Kitty, and their eyes iiet.&#xD;
as a recogiuitiom of something iii each.&#xD;
Wh     was it ? Clari interpreted it, and wis-&#xD;
pered to herself:   "It is loveI I wonder if&#xD;
these two young people know it? How long&#xD;
has this guest been a dweller in our house r&#xD;
Deceitful Kitty ! Cunning Archie ! What are&#xD;
we coiling  to?   Between   mad   youth  and&#xD;
mounitami men, we shall come to grief."&#xD;
So mentally said Clami to Clari.&#xD;
Miss -Sally Dowse popped in. Folly came,&#xD;
also, close at lier' skirts. She had a word to say.&#xD;
'-Then she isn't a nattomn like lie," she iast-&#xD;
ened to affirm. " I'll hang 'emi all, big and lit-&#xD;
tie, hag andi baggage, horse, foot, and artillery."&#xD;
"Je'    '' s:ti I Nick. " Hoss, foot, and artil-&#xD;
lery ; pertic'larly the artillery.''&#xD;
Sally glanced at him to see if lie was quizzing&#xD;
her ; while Mrs. Kimnmouthi availed herself of&#xD;
the pause to remark:&#xD;
"Do as you please, Mr. 'hiffies. I have&#xD;
very little pity for such wretches." Just I len&#xD;
she was tbiikiiig of her last meeting with Har-&#xD;
&#xD;
ker. His conduct on that' occasion had well&#xD;
nilh soured hr sympiathiies fir retels.&#xD;

lived as them  two," added Satlly, with iron ii-&#xD;
gidity of mtanne'r.&#xD;
"omnie to look at ye, straight and steady,"&#xD;
said Nick ; "you, 'mi ine of i   at'ralai't&#xD;
o' miine, on a  mother's side, who finally living&#xD;
herself- to a soiir atple-tree with a skein'o' yarr.&#xD;
omi account o' being crossed in love."&#xD;
Miss Dowse bridled up.&#xD;
She was an amni'ble critter, she was," re&#xD;
sumned Nick, with a semntiuemital waggle of the&#xD;
head.  "She was dreadful attmehed tc cats and&#xD;

o' that kind o' pets. .Kept a reg'lar canine and&#xD;

Sally turned up her nose, and looked con&#xD;
temptuously at Nicek.&#xD;
"Glory hallelujah ! My soul's nebiin' on !"&#xD;
chuckled Flly, who was delighitel with Whiffies.&#xD;
This isn'tL"no time for jestin'," said Sally&#xD;
Dowse, rebukinigly.  "For tIe life of nieI&#xD;
couldn't joke when the country is layin', as&#xD;
'twere, at the p'int of the hagonect."   '&#xD;
" People hadn't omighiter e cheerful when they&#xD;

" Oh, glory !" exclaimed Folly, unable to re-&#xD;
strain her enthusiasm. "Lordy, Mars'r NickI&#xD;

Sally aimed a .back-handed blow at her pro-&#xD;
teg6e, who dodged it without thme'least difficulty.&#xD;
What you want me to buy ye for?" asked&#xD;
Nick.&#xD;
"Cause I takes 'a shine to ye !" cried Folly,&#xD;
dancing up amb down. "Never seen nobody I&#xD;

&#xD;
invollntatrily along the passage, fell on Nick&#xD;
Whiilles riil Mountain Mix.&#xD;
SFail back, inen !'' sail Nick, calmly. "4Come&#xD;
but, Mrs. Kinmouth. It las f:led. It won't&#xD;
do, my lady I Mountalin mn alle.ers sleep with&#xD;
one eye open. Vour drugs tas gone to the&#xD;
dogs; and not to the dogs, neither, but to your&#xD;
chlcUels. You've Showed  gaiime, by, mighty!&#xD;
but it's throwid away in these p'ison critters.&#xD;
If you like t'oter sado best, I don't blame ye&#xD;
for btiekin' to't; but time mistake, woman, was&#xD;
in tli choice."&#xD;
Mrs Kiimouth tottered from  the passage.&#xD;
The lant venture h:mil conc to -naught. Mouo-&#xD;
tain Mix looked at her compassionately.&#xD;
'. 'not desert us! ' cried Aliek Harker.&#xD;
" You must and shall save us."&#xD;
What the lady feared was at hand.&#xD;
Those who had charge of the prisoners made&#xD;
an attempt to close t te door ; but they pressed&#xD;
against it nd pievented them.&#xD;
"Mrs. Kiinmouth," exclimed Blackmer, ".and&#xD;
this ime I believe I have the real Mrs. Kin-&#xD;
mouth-jwhat this man s Sys is reasonable. He&#xD;
fd ,his friend are coindemned to death by these&#xD;
Lincolites. You tre no    v common woman. You&#xD;
} r         are rich,, you are accomplished, you are all- .&#xD;
-    powerful- in your own household. You can&#xD;
ate your say and .-sway. We hold you to&#xD;
tls          our reponsibility. We will not let you go.&#xD;
Your old neig hbors appeal to you for mercy.'"&#xD;
Mrs. Kinmnouth trembaled violently. Moun-&#xD;
thin Max, seeing her situation, supported her&#xD;
ich a pitying arm.&#xD;
" Yes!" shouted Iarker.   "We   are, old&#xD;
neighb~o~s. -ler daughter Clari was once my&#xD;
sweetheart."&#xD;
False ! false !" said a voice from the back-&#xD;
g round"thatsounded like an echo, and-and-&#xD;
fike the voice of Clari.&#xD;
A tremtorshook the arm of Bosworth. Mrs.&#xD;
Mitimoutli felt the thrill of his nerves, and knew&#xD;
whit; it meant. Slee km;ew that it meant Clari.&#xD;
She asked herself: "Will not Clari be better&#xD;
than to have him pass forever from my sight ?"&#xD;
lien heart said " Yes! I&#xD;
" Refuse to save us, at your peril !" threatened&#xD;
fliarker, insolently, thinking t at he held her in&#xD;
the pahn of his hand. -&#xD;
"i'ell hini,", whispered-Max, with his lips&#xD;
close to Mrs. Kinmouth's car, " to say his'say,&#xD;
and'do his worst."&#xD;
a   lme knew then where her safety lay. Those&#xD;
friendly words reassured and encouraged her.&#xD;
Sheiww that Boswortlh knew all, and was ready&#xD;
to forgive all-for the sake of Clai-perchance,&#xD;
somewhiat for her own sake. -A revulsion that&#xD;
was sudden as the lightning passed over her.'&#xD;
Is that the man who was going to murder&#xD;
my husianid ?" she asked, quickly, and' with&#xD;
great tact..&#xD;
,.oliThe same," said Nick Whifles.&#xD;
" How dare lie speak to me !" she muttered.&#xD;
&#xD;
For an instant, ITarker was, silent. Te was&#xD;
confounded. Ilis alacity soon returned.&#xD;
40Occ more, Mrs. Kinmouth, will you save&#xD;
us ?"&#xD;
His voice was hoarse with anger and terror.&#xD;
"Ten minutes ago," answered Mrs. Kinmouth,&#xD;
with spirit, "I would have saved you; but now,&#xD;
so help me God, I }v 'uld not, if I had the&#xD;
power! You have threatened to betray me;&#xD;
but you shall not. I will betray myself. I will&#xD;
confess to these men that I have been a secret&#xD;
foe of the Union,,ani the willing instrument of&#xD;
'traitors. I have performed services for them.&#xD;
at, the remembrance of which I blush, thinking&#xD;
Secession to mean Liberty, and the Confederacy,&#xD;
Chivalry. I an disappointed in both. When&#xD;
men stoop to betray an ally, and that ally a&#xD;
woman, I doubt the justness of their cause, and&#xD;
repudiate it. I can and will tell more than you&#xD;
can reveal."&#xD;
I forbid it !" said Bosworth, putting bis&#xD;
hand upon her lips.&#xD;
" And I, also !" said Nick. " I do; hvmighty 1&#xD;
We know all we want to know, at d ise to him,&#xD;
as tells us more !"         --      -&#xD;
''You are dedeived.,-yon Nick Vhiffles, and&#xD;
you, Mountain Max," cried larker, vindictive-&#xD;
ly. "'rhis'woman betrayed ye toth."&#xD;
"You're..a treacherous bound t"- retorted&#xD;
Nick.  "If a pretty woman like that was to&#xD;
take up with my cause,,anl to help me as air-&#xD;
nest and faithful as she's done, I'd be dragged&#xD;
to pieces by wild perairie-hosses, rather think&#xD;
betray her when my neck is in danger;"&#xD;
"Al! that is the right spirit !" murmured&#xD;
Mrs..Kinmouth.&#xD;
"Letters and holler trees,. midnight journeys&#xD;
ttd gals on hossbaek, are known to as as we! I&#xD;
assto youm. So, you seejyou p'ison Secesh, that&#xD;
your last chance is gone," said Niel    a&#xD;
in a tone of unmistakable satisfhction.&#xD;
Mrs. Ki:monutli felt two other arnas stealing&#xD;
roummd her;,her daughters were gently clasp-&#xD;
ing her.&#xD;
" He's right," growled Harker, fiercely.&#xD;
"It's the last chance. Damn the Yankees !&#xD;
Let's run for it, colonel. Come on, Hugh !"&#xD;
The hushwhackersf made a desperate rus!,&#xD;
followed by Blackmer and -Bramble. The sen-&#xD;
tinels did not oppose thepa.  They pushed&#xD;
through the passage past Nick and Max, and&#xD;
gained the head of the stairs, when there was a&#xD;
sharp, report,, and Blackmer fell. The other&#xD;
two sprang down the stairs, gained the outside&#xD;
door, tore it open, and bounded into the open air.&#xD;
"Saved !" cried Harker.&#xD;
"Firel'' said a stern voice.&#xD;
A half-dozen rifles answered this mandate.&#xD;
The fugitives leaped into the air, and fell on&#xD;
their faces, stricken by avenging bullets. They&#xD;
clutched the ground with their hands, writhed,&#xD;
struggled a few moments with Fate, and ex-&#xD;
pired.&#xD;
&#xD;
MOUNTAIN MAX; OR, NICK WHIFiLES ON TIE BORPE.-&#xD;
&#xD;
Nick Whiffles turned to Clari and Kity, who&#xD;
were yet clasping Mrs. Kinmouth's waist,.and&#xD;
said, presently :&#xD;
