THR CORAL LADY~&#xD;

20                        THE COI~AL LADY.&#xD;
negr~ea, were in keeping with the restof the turnout, the braiding and&#xD;
also the button~ being of fine scarlet silk in imitation of red Coral.&#xD;
The great centre of attraction though, was the occupant of the carriage&#xD;
a young lady of about twenty five years of age. Startlingly and var-&#xD;
ishingly lovely, the stranger was at once the cynosure of all eyes. Yet&#xD;
she seemed utterly indifferent, and took no notice whatever of anything&#xD;
or any person. 11cr features were Grecian in their regularity, while her&#xD;
complexion was of a peculiar bronzed hue, which being lit up by her&#xD;
large, lustrous black eyes, added a fascination to her beauty that was&#xD;
Irresi stable.&#xD;
The dress of  ~a~4ulIr          ~        ini~i~~ with the style&#xD;
of her whole t oughi~Ad ~IWkdd atitJvi4 did not remark&#xD;
how modest and pretty it was. But we will let Mrs. Southworth de-&#xD;
scribe it. She writes:&#xD;

"You must come and see me tomorrow at noon as I have aeked you to&#xD;
do and you shall have my history or: at least part of it."'&#xD;
"It must be a strange one," remarked 1.&#xD;
"You will say so more earnestly than new when 'you hear it. But I&#xD;
have overstayed imy'time from home. Adieu, and IIeav~en's goodangol be&#xD;
with you till we meet again. Remember, tomorrow at noon, and alone.&#xD;
Adieu."&#xD;
Th~zs speaking the lovely, mysterious girl-.for in appearance at least&#xD;
she was such~-gave my band a warm~ squeeze, sprang lightly into her&#xD;
carriage, which almost instantly whirled away down the Avenue, leaving&#xD;
me wrapt up more completely than ever in wonder and amazement.&#xD;
I rejoined the group of My'friends who instead of driving to their hotels&#xD;
shad all dismounted again and were anxiously awaiting me, expecting&#xD;
doubtless that' I would have some interminable and rich piece of gossipto&#xD;
impart to them concerning the Coral Lady. Their anxiety, however, was&#xD;
turned only int&amp;amp; disappointment when I tol4 the extent and ~nature of&#xD;
my interview, excepting the invitation to visit Eloise, Which I did not&#xD;
mention for fear it might require me to deny the instant and importunate&#xD;
applications, I knew weuld~have been thrust at me to;take a friend with ins.&#xD;

Ta~ OQUAL LAJ~T.&#xD;
Tfb3r aome;magical trar~sporting pewer~ I had been taken by the hand,&#xD;
~3%t 1ift~d :froni the ~Qldj and nninviting~ scenery of a Northern land, and&#xD;
placed in an instant after in the midst of some glowing luxuriant elinie~of&#xD;
tha Oriental Tropics, r~iy p.stnuisbment could n6thave been half as great&#xD;
~s when. Latepped thus fMn~ay, dashing, frivolous Paris, into this&#xD;
apartment, wb~re ~Ml the Barbaric Splendors ofRastern Countries dazzled&#xD;
my' eyes, and the t~nknown hut delicious perfumes~ distilled from sacred&#xD;
gums and spices ma4e ~n~y senses gr'~w dim with their ;e~quisite odors,&#xD;
and held 'me spellbound as tb~tigh a million of fairies had each quivering&#xD;
nerve a captive.&#xD;
Nor was mu~sie'*antit~g to complete theetberlaiscetie around me; for,&#xD;
beside, the warblings 1f birds ingilded cagee~-whose notes were entirely&#xD;
strange to my ears-4here eamefloating to me as though far away from'&#xD;
some dream realm, dulcet strains of combined v~eal and instrumental&#xD;
music. ,&#xD;
"Is this magic ?'~ whispered I to myself almost trembling with the new&#xD;
sensation my situation Inspired within me. I saw noono in the iru~&#xD;
mense room. or rather ~aloon, which instead of being lighted in the usual&#xD;
manner (for the r~de~ will r~x~ember it wasi noonday) was illu~m~nated&#xD;
by eandel~bras, atregul~r interyalsalong thpwalls;and in which Candela~&#xD;
bras burned candles of perfumed wax..&#xD;
The walls were draped and hung with rich coral and black velvet and&#xD;
silk 'hangings, while interspersed am9ng. the festoQus, with the iltm95t&#xD;
elegance of. taste, were Qruaments of alabaster, ony4~, bronze; and richly&#xD;
enameled paintings. Looking along the apartment II was bewildered with&#xD;
the almost numberless varieties, and beauty of the furniture, though one&#xD;
peculiarity struck ~r~e with mwch force which ~ that among all this&#xD;
gorgeous furnishing there was ~ot a single cha~ visible. Divans and Qt~.&#xD;
tonx~ns and pgshions and rugs all of such r~~gni~ent material ai~d luxu~&#xD;
riotis apparanco a~ to almost defy comparison, much less imitation.&#xD;
There were fll5Q i~anytables of strange and handsome material but of a&#xD;
style such as i~ only used ii~ the i~ar East.&#xD;
The screens of which I have spoken were at once the mosi splendid&#xD;
e~ecimeus of art that I have ever' beheld~ Some were of silk, others of&#xD;
satin and velvet; all embroidered in the superbest manner, and mounted&#xD;
upon antique and odd~shaped frames, that moved in any direction at the&#xD;
slightest touch.&#xD;
Another peculiarity I noted was that the floor' instead of being carpeted&#xD;
was covered with beautiful rugs in which the feet sank deeply at every&#xD;
step.&#xD;
Reader, do not imagine that; because J have been somewhat long and&#xD;
prosey in my description of the ~a1ov4 of the, Corsil Lady, I was lone ~n&#xD;
seeing its details and beauties and singuI~irities, for my eyes drank in al~&#xD;

to perceive that something unusual' bad occurred, and he said;&#xD;
"'Why Eloise, what is the matter with you?'&#xD;
"I longed to fling my arms about him~ and tell him all, and ende~v~t&#xD;

THE SECOND INTEUYIEW.&#xD;
It was late in the night before I could get to sleep on account 'of think.&#xD;

also of th~c coming one the next day~ My slumber also, though n6t ~lis..&#xD;
turbed by, wae fihlc4 with, dreamed of Eloise. I did not loiter hi the owrn-&#xD;
ing, bot was promptly at the door of Eloise by twelve o'clock. The&#xD;
footman had nothing to say on this occasion; bu~ bowing low; at once&#xD;
preceded ~me 'to the Salon of his Mistress 'wh6 r~eived iie' evOn iuiore;&#xD;
pleasantly than yesterday. We had a general conversation for a shori~&#xD;
time at~d ~h~n suddenly, the same 'as the day previous, Il~loi~e rosume~&#xD;
her life narrative.&#xD;
~ 'I broke off'yesterday,' said she, a~ the point whOre Lena followed&#xD;
Herbert and Ann flivel. ' She had traced them to the St. 'Charhs 'Hotel,&#xD;
and having inquired in the office ha~ found out the numb~re of their&#xD;
rooms, which were the sarnc~ ones exactly' a~ r bad once o~upied. T~ius,&#xD;
bitter and more bitter became the wormwood in the 'cop thae Ill Fortune&#xD;

tending the dreadful error I had made hi ~btnitting~'to Eerbei't's desires&#xD;
and theproniptiugs of my own love for him.&#xD;
"'I will take my darling Child' said I to myself, 'go away' from here,&#xD;
far away, whero ~he nor I will never ~ee nor' hear of her father; and&#xD;
spend the f~ituro in redeeming the past4'&#xD;
"The next day I went out for the ~urposc of engaging rooMs; but&#xD;
apartments chancing lust then t~ be very scarce, I did bet su~ceedia'&#xD;
procuring any, and by evening I 'retiirned~ home utterly worn out with&#xD;
fatigue. Lena bad kept~faithfnily by Eloise during the wh~time I had&#xD;
been out. On hearing of my, non~success, Lena sugge~t~d that a lac~y,&#xD;
whom I knew, had been speakitxg of an acqnainta~nce of hers Who was do.&#xD;
sirious of l~ttin~ a part of her house to a person of ~nqqesti9nable res~&#xD;
pectability'. I was too tired to go myself, sO I sent Lena with a message&#xD;
to the lafly in regard to the n~atter. *&#xD;
"LittlO Eloise was hxceedingly glad to see me return h~ine, and she&#xD;
and I spent several 'ho1Urs in play. It lightened my own sad heart to thus&#xD;
make pleasure for ~y 'Child. Time passed away~ and it began to get late.&#xD;
Still Le~adi~l not conic, and I commenced to feel' much anxiety about h~i.&#xD;
Yet, thinking she must have been detained, I sat down~and rocked&#xD;
Eloise to sleep. '&#xD;

had ~e~oWed to go down the moment I should be thrown4 into the&#xD;
water; and thus en~dmy sufferings quickly. 'But when 'I was iuthe sea,&#xD;
I eeenwd to suddenly become animated with a strong desire to live.&#xD;
Thusliupelled, I seized hold of a broken plank, and began to buffet the&#xD;
waves with might and main; though all round me string mm~ '~ank'~oan-&#xD;
ing to their watery graves. Strange as it i:nay seem to you, I reached&#xD;
the shore the sole survivor of that ship load of human beings.&#xD;
"At first the natives, who had~ now increased to several hundred in&#xD;
number, appeared afraid of me, deeming me as charmed to thus escape&#xD;
when all had perished.' Yet they took good care that Idid not' go away;&#xD;
and some twenty of them surrounding me as a sortof 'guard of honor 211&#xD;
suppose, t~Vo of' them burt, me more than a mile to the palace ef the King,&#xD;
to whom, 'with many formalities they presented me. I remained in the&#xD;
King's household about a week; being kept 'more like a state prisoner&#xD;
than anything 'else, and was then made to understand that the King had&#xD;
given me as a wife to Faridang, a favorite officer of his, in acknowledge-&#xD;
meat of faithful services.&#xD;
"Thete was iio escape; and I wa~ obliged to submit. I was married&#xD;
to the bronze-faced Faralang,' a noble iooking'man, who soon proved him-&#xD;
self the fondest' and best of husbands. 'My pale face, though at first a&#xD;
curiosity, soon became ~Iistasteftil to Faralang,. and also to his friends,&#xD;
and in order to pleas~ at least him; I sought' th&amp;amp; services of an old Doc-&#xD;
tor on the lelirod, who, by thn application' of Some mysterious unguent,&#xD;
changed my complexion to what you now behold it, a deep, golden bronze.&#xD;
~'A very silort time after this, Favalang, while out hunting tigers, was&#xD;
injured fatally; though he lingered nearly three weeks after receiving&#xD;
the' hurts. attended him faithfully during his illness, and as. a fittIng&#xD;
manifestation of41 hi~ 'love he ordered, that, with the consent of" the King,&#xD;
I.' should be allowed to leave the island and go abroad in search of my&#xD;
enemy, Ann Rivel-.only exacting the promise on 'my part that J'wonld re-&#xD;
tarn to Sumatra as soon' as possible. This I of course'acceeded to; for&#xD;
there, in that lovely' clime; 'I learned to love the noblest and best of men.&#xD;
Not, though, iVith that fervid ,and imperishable intensity with which I&#xD;
had idolized Herbert! Ah, no! for Herbert's memory was laid away in&#xD;
my heart of hearts, never to be effaced by anything else. On his behalf&#xD;
and on that of his child, had~I s~t forth on my mission of vengeance; and&#xD;

Dear Sir:&#xD;
You will reepliect that, when I placed in&#xD;

whom she evidently idolized. I never e~pectedto hear of her again~ but&#xD;

As I cut open the envelope with my scissors, T was eonsueied with&#xD;
excited emotions, and em I took out the triple folded ~heets of writing,&#xD;
I asked myself fifty questions; for I well knew who the manuscript canae&#xD;
from. I migbt 1111 many :quWes of pap~r telling you all about the couteI~tB&#xD;

forward it to you to add to the new edition of The Coral Lady Book. It&#xD;
is far more powerful than any previous portion of the narrative, and com~&#xD;

M~ DEAR FRiEND, Mas. SouTriwoaTir:&#xD;
When You and I parted from&#xD;
from each other in Paris, I thought that I should not only never see yonr&#xD;
kindly face again in this life; but also that mo.~t likely I should never&#xD;
have the opportunity of writiu~ to you as I had promised, for I felt&#xD;
nearly certain at that time that Fate had decreed me non-success in my&#xD;
pursuit of Ann Rivel. But for once the Goddess relented, and one of the&#xD;
results is that I am now penning this to you; and the other you will as~~&#xD;

Affectionately Yours:&#xD;
ELoIsE DE LAUNEY.&#xD;
its you are already aware, when I conversed with you in Paris I had&#xD;
lost all trace for some time of Ann Rivel, the vile creature who had ruined&#xD;
my happiness for all time to come, Throughout the whole city of Parn~&#xD;
high and low, in all kinds of n*hborboods I sent detectives, end often&#xD;
went myself in disguise with the object of obtaining some clue that might&#xD;

THE CORAL LADY.&#xD;
lead to the detection of the whereabouts of my intended victim. Yet, day&#xD;
after day, and night after night, the same result was always reached, and&#xD;
the same monotonous reports made-&#xD;
"Nothing yet! nothing yet!"&#xD;
One night about one o'clock I was awakened suddenly as by the pres-&#xD;
once of some one close by my couch. I knew such a thing was impossi-&#xD;
ble for I was surrounded by screens, and my servants would no more&#xD;
think of intruding upon my privacy, without being summoned by me,&#xD;
than they would of ascending to the moon; for they knew that I always&#xD;
kept a loaded pistol 'ready for iusti~nt use.&#xD;
For sometime I laid awake oppressed with that singular sensation of&#xD;
some one being close to me and yet seeing no one, and finally so disagree-&#xD;
able did this become, that I was obliged to get up. I walked about and&#xD;
read and then played and sang, and thinking I had dissipated the sensa-&#xD;
tion. I once more threw myself on my couch and soon fell asleep.&#xD;
Again, however, I was once more aroused in the same mysterious&#xD;
manner. And as I opened my eyes the dim shadow of Herbert Darnelle&#xD;
flitted past me and was gone, as all shadows go. It did not look at me;&#xD;
it did not speak to me; it merely passed by, and was no doubt an im-&#xD;
presBion of the mind; for I hadjust previously to going asleep the second&#xD;
time, been thinking about him.&#xD;
Suddenly the thought suggested itself to me to go back to the hamlet&#xD;
of Allan6 in Burgundy, and there I would hear of Ann Rivel. This&#xD;
thought seemed to me to be in some way connected with that vague sha-&#xD;
dow, that bodiless form of Hcrbert.Darnelle, which had come and gone as&#xD;
the light cloud flies swiftly across the face of the sun. This I argued to&#xD;
myself wa~ another of those impressions made by the mind on itself, and&#xD;
whi~h, had I been more sensitive, I should have ascribed to supernatural&#xD;
causes. Still, nevertheless, the impression remained; nay ; it grew&#xD;
stronger and stronger. Finally, such a bold did it take on me that I re-&#xD;
solved to go back to Allane. I argued to myself that, perhaps during the&#xD;
second visit I might find, some means of learning something that I had&#xD;
missed during the previous visit. No sooner did I come to this resolu-&#xD;
tion than I was on my way to the romantic hamlet among the mountains&#xD;
of Ilurgundy, Alland.&#xD;
Instead of travelling this time as I had done before; namely, by rail-&#xD;
road, I hired relays of light, swift coaches, each drawn by four splendid&#xD;
horses. My orders were to place me in Allan6 as quickly as it could be&#xD;
done; and if fifty horses were killed, I would pay for them.&#xD;
The result was that I reached my destination almost as speedily as by&#xD;
steam, and without the possibility of any person anticipating my arrival.&#xD;
The host of the little inn, at Alland was tender struck at seeing me again;&#xD;
for he had supposed T would never retu ~ I had not intended to stop at&#xD;
his inn, but to go straight to the cottage which had been inhabited by&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CORAL LADY,                  '     67&#xD;
Ann Rivel. But as it turned out, I was obliged to pass the inn on my&#xD;
road, and~ of course you, as a traveler, will understand the utter impossi-&#xD;
bility of passing a country inn without being seen by the omni-present&#xD;
landlord, and landlady, and all the rest about the establishment.&#xD;
Out flew Monsieur Fallon, his wife, children and servants. I was&#xD;
completely surrounded and so plied with congratulations and requests to..&#xD;
come in and take full ~possession of the inn, that I was forced to surrender&#xD;
at last.&#xD;
"Madame," said Monsieur, as he escorted me to the best chamber his&#xD;
domicile aWorded; "I have something to impart to you, privately."&#xD;
I was at once eager to listen, and after closing the door Monsieur Fallon&#xD;
began:&#xD;
"Madame; do you not remember, last time you were here, that the&#xD;
person you were in pursuit of, Ann IRivel, made her flight just before&#xD;
you went to her cottage? "&#xD;
"Yes I do, Monsieur Fallon, very distinctly. What news have you&#xD;
of her? Any? Has she returned? Is she still there? Has she the little&#xD;
girl with her yet ?"&#xD;
These interrogatives I put to Monsieur Fallon with I suppose rather&#xD;
bewildering rapidity; for, passing h~s band several times over his fore~&#xD;
bead, he begged that I would let him answer one at a time.&#xD;
"Tell me all; and do it quickly 1" was my rejoinder; at which the&#xD;
fussey little host began:&#xD;
"You had heen left Allan6 about a fortnight only; when, one morning&#xD;
by a little after sunrise, we beheld Madame Rivel coming along the&#xD;
"Had she the girl with her ?" I interrupted, laying my hand on Mon-&#xD;
sieur Fallon's arm.&#xD;
"No, Madame, she had not."&#xD;
"Alas I" I cried, "poor little Eloise! She was the one ± really wanted!&#xD;
I am her mother! But, proceed! proceed !,"&#xD;
"Of course," resumed my host, "we were all much surprised to behold&#xD;
Madame Rivel come back; an'il still more so when she announced to&#xD;
us that she had returned to stay. Two days after that she went away&#xD;
again, and again returned, this time bringing the little girl with her&#xD;
"Oh, thank God! then both are still here I" exclaimed I, again inter-&#xD;
rupting Monsieur Fallon.&#xD;
"I do not think they are, Madame. In fact I know they are not. For&#xD;
only yesterday Madame Rivel, after all her assurances that she intended&#xD;
to remain here permanently, suddenly took her departure. The little&#xD;
girl was with her, and she never stopped but went away as fast as she&#xD;
"Did she say whither she was going ?" asked I.&#xD;
"No, Madame; but, as I saw her leaving with so much precipitation,&#xD;
it occurred to me that most likely you were approaching onr little village&#xD;
&#xD;

OS                     TX~E CORAL LADY.&#xD;
in pursuit of her again. I had cause to remember you gratefully, and I&#xD;
sent Jacques, my son, to follow Madame Rivel for two or three days, sup-&#xD;
plying him with money for all his expenses."&#xD;
"Oh! thanks.! thanks, my shrewd friend I" I exclaimed; "both your&#xD;
son and yourself shall be amply remunerated I lie has not returned I&#xD;
suppose?"&#xD;
"Not .yet~ Madame~ Ht~ will ~~ be back for two days, unless eircum~&#xD;
stances induce him to alter the plan I laid out for him. And I assure&#xD;
you, Madarhe, Jacques iS no fool; iexd if Madame Rivel misleads him I&#xD;
will givb h~r full credit."&#xD;
I was obliged to remain at Ailan6 and await the return of Jacques&#xD;
Fallon 'with what good or ill news he might have to bring me. That&#xD;
day passed drearily enough, though all was bright and serene in the little&#xD;
valley. In the same manner passed the succeeding day. And the third&#xD;
one bade fair to be like the other tWo. You could not ~magifle my anxiety&#xD;
and distress as I sat by my chamber window, watching the path by&#xD;
which Jacques must come, as it wound its zigzaz way up the mountain's&#xD;
side. My eyes ached with gazing, and the shadows cast by thesetting&#xD;
sun began to be deep and sombre over the vale of Allani. Still Jacques&#xD;
was unheard from. The sombre shadows became blended and deepened&#xD;
into one dark mantle, wrapping hi~mlet, mountain and forest in night;&#xD;
and my aching eyes suffused with tears. There was a hope and a fear&#xD;
connected with Jacques thus overstaying the allotted time. The hope&#xD;
was, that, having got fairly on the track of Ann Rivel, and it continuing&#xD;
with promise of near success, he had kept on. The fear was, that, find-&#xD;
ing herself thus watched, the shrewd, wicked woman had drawn the&#xD;
lad into some bye way and perhaps silenced him forever, as she had once&#xD;
before silenced one far dearer to me than life-~-poor Herbert Darnelle.&#xD;
I mentioned my suspicions to Monsieur Fallon; but, with a shrug of&#xD;
the shoulders, and a meaning twinkle of his grey eyes, he said:&#xD;
"Ab I Madame does Jacques injustice! Jacques will give a good ac-&#xD;
count of himself.! and I think his delay bodes good fortune !-Ha! ha!&#xD;
there is his horn now! The Marseilaise! ha! ha! Madame! I told Jac-&#xD;
ques to give us the Marsellaise as he crossed the mountain's crest, if he&#xD;
had good success. Good news, Madame! Jacques is no fool! Hark don't&#xD;
you hear it ?-there! now comes in the chorus !"&#xD;
The window was open; but I heard nothing. Mine were unexperien-&#xD;
ced care. I looked up where I knew the path must wind, and I saw through&#xD;
the night a spark of fire that moved like a star swinging back and forth~&#xD;
Monsieur Fallon looked also, and exclaimed in his ecstasy:&#xD;
"Hurrah! Madame-! that's Jacques, ~Winging his lantern! That's a&#xD;
signal I told him to make in case the wind carried the sound of his horn&#xD;
away from our direction I"&#xD;
&#xD;
At this moment the sweet and powerful notes of Jacques' French horn&#xD;
came down to my ears on the evcnihg wind. The Marsellaise I Great&#xD;
heaven I never had I heard that tumultuously- thrilling melody under&#xD;
such exciting circumstances. My whole being trembled with excitement,&#xD;
I conid hardly control myself. I strained my head as far as possible out&#xD;
of the window with eye and ear intent. And once, I remember, shaking&#xD;
Monsieur Fallon to induce him to remain quiet about the merits of&#xD;
Jacques.&#xD;
Nearer and nearer caine. that swinging lantern of Jacques, and clearer&#xD;
and clearer became the notes of his well played horn, till finally the stal-&#xD;
wart lad, covered with dust, stood before me in my chamber; while his&#xD;
father capered and pranced around him like one out of his senses.&#xD;
In a plain, straightforward manner, and with a peasant's simplicity,&#xD;
Jacques narrated to myself and his father his adventures since the chase&#xD;
on which his father had sent him, commenced, He had traced Ann Ri-&#xD;
vel from town to town, until reaching. Besangon, he had ascertained that&#xD;
she intended, after remaining there a short time, to go to Berne, in Swit-&#xD;
zerland, where she had several years previous purchased a cottage. lie&#xD;
had evidently displayed much acuteness in his pursuit, nor did he quit it&#xD;
until he thought it safe to do so. The information he brought me was&#xD;
most valuable; and I not only thanked him; but gave him' such a reward~&#xD;
as made him stare with surprise. Nor did I forget his father who had&#xD;
so shrewdly sent his son Jacques on the pursuit, on the supposition that&#xD;
I would appear in Allan~ immediately after Ann Rivol left it.&#xD;
AGAIN IN PURSUIT.&#xD;
The next morning by sun-rise I was far up the mountain side, making&#xD;
my way to I3esancon with all possible speed, and praying with all possi-&#xD;
ble fervor that Ann Rivelmight not resume her journey until she and I&#xD;
had met face to face. I had not travelled far before an accident happen.&#xD;
ed which came near ending my life. I was riding a mule that .1 had&#xD;
hired with a guide to take me across the mountains. We had come to a&#xD;
dangerous path on the mountain side, and a heavy rain having fallen,&#xD;
made it extremely slippery. The animal I rode had lever performed&#xD;
the journey before, and consequently was not to be depended on. This&#xD;
I was in ignorance of, until we were approaching the dangerous place to&#xD;
which I have just referred; when my guide cautioned me to look out for&#xD;
any slipping or faltering of the animal, and instructed me what to do in the&#xD;
occurrence of such an event. At any other time I should have promptly&#xD;
turned back; but no~ now. No! not if Satan himself had stood in my&#xD;

~p~thway would Ii have taken one retrograde step~ On we kept, and sure&#xD;
enough,, when the animal I rode got to the dangerous portion of the route&#xD;
he began to lose confidence in himself, exactly as a human being&#xD;
might de.&#xD;
The further the brute advanced the more frightened did he become, and&#xD;
about the middle' of a path that led through a dismal gorge, he lost his&#xD;
footing and slid down a steep declivity nearly a hundred and fifty feet.&#xD;
Here he caught on a ridge or narrow ledge, about six inches in width,&#xD;
which arrested his, progress down the rest of the incline at least five&#xD;
hundred feet more.&#xD;
Jean, the guide, stopped his mule; and uncoiling a long, strong cord-&#xD;
that guides carry f9r just su~ch acciclents-he was preparing to throw it to&#xD;
me, when suddenly, from some unexplained cause, the brute I rode be-&#xD;
gan to rear and plunge. On a level plain this would have been sufficiently&#xD;
dangerous t~ the rider; but midway down a mountain side, scarcely any~&#xD;
thing but a ~miracle co"ild 4save any one. I thought of a desperate re-&#xD;
source; and, drawing my poignard, I was in the very act of killing the&#xD;
beast. The point of the steel was"aimed directly at the spinal cord, and&#xD;
another nuloment would have brought the mule down dead.&#xD;
At this juncture, however, his hoot broke away a portion of the ridge,&#xD;
and, as he struggled to save himself, he pitched me~ off his back, and&#xD;
sent me whirling down the declivity like a shot. Death stared me in the&#xD;
face; but I did not lose my presence of mind. I clutched the poignard,&#xD;
and each time I rolled over,' I tried to drive it into the ground. Twenty&#xD;
times at least did I make t1~e effort before I succeeded. But finally I did&#xD;
succeed, and my headlong descent was stopped.&#xD;
I glanced upward, and there beheld the mule, where he had stood;&#xD;
while at the top of~the declivity I saw Jean, doing nothing more sensible&#xD;
than crossing himself and making other motions of despair. In fact it&#xD;
seemed to me as though he could not see me for some moments in spite&#xD;
ok~ ~ repeated screams to attract his attention.&#xD;
i The mule 'was still plunging and slipping, and, as I was in a' direct&#xD;
1 e. l~~lo~ him, ~ began to tremble lest he should come rolling down&#xD;
upon me and crush me to death. To avoid this peril I crept carefully&#xD;
in an oblique direction to a place of safety; and again shouted to the&#xD;
guide.&#xD;
By this time that worthy had somewhat regained his composure, and&#xD;
at once began to ~escend towards where. I was. This was a matter of&#xD;
the greatest risk, even for such an experience rnountaineeras Jean. But&#xD;
finally after great exertion and one or two ugly slips, he got the cord to&#xD;
me. Then commenced the great struggle to reach the path from which I&#xD;
had originally been thrown. The very thought of~that frightful ascent&#xD;
makes me tremble.&#xD;

cape, Jean succeeded in assisting me to a ufirm' footing once more on the&#xD;
path. So great was his fear at having been The cause ,of the accident,&#xD;
that he went down on his .knees, begged my pardon, and prayed me&#xD;
that I would not ruin him by saying anything' about the reason of the ac-&#xD;
ciden~, pleading his wife, children, and aged parents, who were depend-&#xD;
ent on his profits as a guide for their living. Though very angry at the&#xD;
fellow, I forgave him, and the journey was at once resumed, Jean walk-&#xD;
ing, and I riding on his mule, a throughly-safe and sure-footed animal,&#xD;
who, Jean averred, would carry me safe along a path though it be no&#xD;
wider than the back of a sword. Before starting again I insisted onJean&#xD;
shooting the unfortunate mule that still stood far down the side of the&#xD;
mountain, as it would be impossible to save it, and cruel 4n the extreme&#xD;
to let it stand there till it starved. Beside~, the poor brute, when it found&#xD;
us going, looked up, and uttered such a groaning sound of agony that it&#xD;
was extremely touching to~ hear. * ' -&#xD;
The rest of thejourney was accomplished without any event occurring&#xD;
that was worthy of being recorded and I arrive~1 in Besaiicon full of hope&#xD;
and fear-hope that I might overtake the woman who had caused me such&#xD;
*trouble and unhappiness, and fear that, as she had done previously, so&#xD;
now she might escape me. I felt rather meanly of myself; alsoto think&#xD;
that she could escape from me always, and with so much apparent ease.&#xD;
ARRIVAL IN BESANCON.&#xD;
As I entered the lovely town of Besancon I met a peasant and his wife&#xD;
going to their work. I stopped them, and after some casual inquiries I&#xD;
asked: ' '&#xD;
"Can you tell me, whether any strange men have come into Besaneon&#xD;
within the last two weeks ?" /&#xD;
"Yes, Madame," replied the woman, "there have been three com6 in&#xD;
that time. 'Two of them were workingmen looking for employment and&#xD;
the other was a gentleman who called himself a Nature man I think; and&#xD;
he was hunting up flowers and weeds and birds and bugs. The queerest&#xD;
thing I ever heard of."&#xD;
"You mean, he called himself a Naturalist 1"&#xD;
"Oh, yes, Madame, that. was it."&#xD;
"I suppose there were no women with either of the three men," said I&#xD;
coming as'gradually as possible to the point I wished to settle, 'and yet&#xD;
speaking in a half-indifferent tone of voice.&#xD;
"No, Madame, there were not. Them kindof men I dont 'think would&#xD;
care much about lugging women about with them."&#xD;

"No, Madame, I don't know what her name was; but I know what&#xD;

by a sudden discovery. Then she finished her- sentence with:&#xD;
"Why she looked just like you; only she was ~ot a gold color like your&#xD;

&#xD;
v-bed the tr~me state of the case. I once read a story of a miner who was&#xD;
at work in a copper mine that extended under a lake. An immense mass&#xD;
of earth fell behind him and buried him in a. living tomb from which no&#xD;
friendly hand could rescue him. After some hours he became almoatmad&#xD;
with thirst, and knowing that but a-thin crust of earth was between him&#xD;
and the water of the lake-above, he desperately seized his pick ate, and&#xD;
began to bring down huge lumps of ore and earth in the double hope of&#xD;
slaking his thirst, and rising to the surface of waves and swimming ashore.&#xD;
Presently the w5ter began to trickle through; but scarcely had the&#xD;
poor man thanked Providence for this,~ before the angry deluge burst&#xD;
through with horrible noise and vio1ence~ and dashed him iat~ a mangled&#xD;
coi~pse.&#xD;
I felt much like that man for~the discovery had burst in upon nie from&#xD;
that poor peasant woman's mouth like the deluge which had destroyed&#xD;
him. .1 was completely nonplussed; but suddenly I thought: "Why&#xD;
not make a frisud of this woman? ~he will serve me for gold if not for&#xD;
any other re~son." With this resolution I again adiireesed her:&#xD;
"Yea, I am that little girl's mother. That woman stole her from me&#xD;
and I am in pursuit of her. Perhaps you are a mother yourself. If&#xD;
you will help me to accomplish my oh~ect I will give you gold. Do -you&#xD;
see it? I will give you m6re than you ever had in all your life."&#xD;
"Madame," said the woman, "'if it was only the gold, though Pierre&#xD;
and myself are wretchedly poor, I wbuld tell you no. Iliit as it would be&#xD;
in a good cause I will serve you any way I can, and s~ will Pierre here if&#xD;
you will pay us as much wages a day as we can now make at our work.??&#xD;
"~Iow much is that ?" I asked.'~&#xD;
"]?orvy Sons, Madame."     -       (about ~6 cents Editor.)&#xD;
"Forty Sons!" exclaimed I, in astonishment at such a meagre sum,&#xD;
"yes 1 will giv, you each five francs a day."&#xD;
"Ahi Heaven bless you, Lady 1" ejaculated Pierre the husband, "why&#xD;
that will enable us to give both our so~i and dai~gbter a handsome start&#xD;
in life."&#xD;
"Serve me well and faithfidly," replied I, and your son and daughter&#xD;
shall both have an outtit such as no peasant in the region ever had be~&#xD;
fore.&#xD;
The woman burst into tears ofjoy at this, and Pierre could not restrain&#xD;
himself from embracing his wifb on the spot. Till that moment I never&#xD;
knew how happy one could be by making others happy. Upon further&#xD;
conversing, I learned that the woman, Christine, bad been born and&#xD;
raised within a few miles of l3erne, and had many friends and relatives&#xD;
there.&#xD;
I now4~elt a sudden impression come on me that this time I would he&#xD;
successful; that the fugitive could no longer elude me; and that I would&#xD;
recover my child, Eloise. I at once engaged the two peasants, Christine&#xD;
and her husband, and turning back with me they entered the town of&#xD;

EUNTEP DOWN AT LAST.&#xD;
I now felt renewed vigor in the chase, and proceeded tolay my plans ~rs&#xD;
a ~genei'a1 might do who appreciated the difficulty of the coming battle,&#xD;
and yet was sure of victory. To avoid as much aspossible any excite-&#xD;
ment ~that my arrival might make, I went directly' to the cottage, or&#xD;
rather hut, of my peasant friends, where I found the son and daughter&#xD;
one tWe~it~' and the dther' seventeen. Bright, intelligent and handsome,&#xD;
their humble parents might well be proud of them; and When they were&#xD;
to1~ my intentioha toward them their hap~nes~ was indeed a happy sight&#xD;
to see. FatheL', mother' and 'both children at once commenced the search&#xD;
for me, :and within ~ few hours' learned that the ~tran~e"lady with the&#xD;
little girl had remained'oiily one day in the town and had then departed&#xD;
for Berno in Switzerland.&#xD;
Thie was what I had really expected to hear; and I was therefore pre-&#xD;
pared with my plan. I ~ent the Sach~s, father, mother, son and daugh-&#xD;
ter, instantly to Berne with. instrLlQ.tions to ascertain the exact locality in&#xD;
which. Ann Rivei had settled, and then to keep a strict watch on her&#xD;
movements until I arrived. The reason I did this was that each time be-&#xD;
fore that I had gone directly to a place where she was, she had ascer-&#xD;
tained my approach by some means or other., But I had now found as-&#xD;
sistants on whom I felt I could depend, and so I remained in Besancon&#xD;
three days after their departure, in order to give them time to obtain the&#xD;
information desir~d. 'It~vras exceedingly trying to my patience thus to&#xD;
'wait, but I controlled n~yself, and did not' start for Berne until the day&#xD;
and hour hadi fixed upon. Then, however, I travelled at the utm6st speed&#xD;
that l~oimld, and arrived in Berne in good season.&#xD;
My~ f~lerids were iinpati~ntly awaiting my coming.&#xD;
"Well, ~2lhristine,". said I as I alighted from the conveyance at the&#xD;
spot, an4 met the faithful peasant woman, "what news have you? good&#xD;
or bad?"&#xD;
"We.have found out the woman, Madame, or at least where she lived.&#xD;
But sh~ is very skk. They say she is dying."&#xD;
"And the little girl ?" I inquired.&#xD;
"She is in the house with her."&#xD;
"It is; welL Take me to the house at once," rejoined I, a terrible de-&#xD;
termination coming oyer me.&#xD;
"The cottage is not, in the city, Madame, but in a sequestered spot&#xD;
about two miles and a half to the Northward of it. The road also is very&#xD;
&#xD;
TUE  CORAL LADt            /           1(5&#xD;
difficult. Do not think me too bold, Madame, but I would advise yen&#xD;
to leave it till tomorrow morning as it is now so close on to night."&#xD;
Upon thinking over this friendly advice, I resolved to follow it; not&#xD;
failing to remember that it was most likely myheadlong baste that had&#xD;
so often before given Ann Rivel a warning of my approach.&#xD;
That night was a long and anxious one to me, and sleep was a strang-&#xD;
er to my eyes during its dreary passage. By day break the next morn-&#xD;
ing, I was on the road with Pierre and Christine to the house where my&#xD;
enemy lay sick-.where they said she was dying-where, for the first&#xD;
time since the night that Eloise was torn from my enclasping arms in&#xD;
New Orleans, I would set my eyes on the darling a~ain.&#xD;
XVa found the road fully as difficult, if i~ot more so than Christine had&#xD;
described it, and we were severaihours in coming to the cottage of Ann&#xD;
ILivel. It, was hidden down in a romantic little deli, and so buried in&#xD;
sweotilowering vines and graceful trees that I should certainly have&#xD;
j~c'I by without sceingit, had not Pierre said:&#xD;
~Thc're i~ady, there is the place right down there oil' the road."&#xD;
Ietdwd' stid saw the smoke curling peacefully out above the chimney,&#xD;
~u ~ ;iwh was the effect upon me, that I was obliged to sit down on a&#xD;
n'.. s roveEt'41 rock near by to regain my composure. This did not ceiP&#xD;
st~iet~' netwh time, however, and ordering my two peasant friends to re-&#xD;
nanin where they were, and await my return, or else my signal, I des-&#xD;
eendt~d to the cottage, and knocked at the door. The summous was not&#xD;
answered, and so I boldly walked in.&#xD;
"Now then for her I" I whispered to myself, drawing my poignard.-&#xD;
the one that had been stolen from me~that had been driven into the&#xD;
heart of poor Herbert Darnelle-..and the one that I now intended to plant&#xD;
in the heart of her, who I felt fully assured had been his foul murderess.&#xD;
I had taken but a few steps, however, when I was confronted by a rough&#xD;
~ll-visaged old woman, who demanded to know what I wanted;' an&#xD;
I had entered without waiting to be admitted.&#xD;
"Silence, hag I" I exclaimed, pushing her back, "I wish to see your&#xD;
mistress, Ann Rivel. Where is she? She shall not escape me this&#xD;
time I"&#xD;
A scream, as of'some one in rage or agony, rung upon my ears at this&#xD;
moment. It came from a room on the right, between which and rue&#xD;
stood the old woman. Seizing~ the latter~ I hurled her from before me,&#xD;
and, at a few steps, stood in the presence of my enemy, Ann Ri~el. It&#xD;
was her chamber, and, merciful Heaven I there she lay on her couch dy-&#xD;
ing! I had hitherto disbelieved the report of her dying, us a story, set&#xD;
afloat by herself for some dark purpose of her own. But I could not&#xD;
doubt that haggard face, those checks, hollow, and white as marble;&#xD;
those eyes, brilliantly glassy, and the sweat of near dissolution standing on&#xD;
her~forehead in beads. r&#xD;

"You have come at last! and disguised I" exclaimed Ann Rivel, glar-&#xD;
ing at me like &amp;amp; tigress, and endeavoring to rise to a sitting posture, but&#xD;
sinking back on one elbow.&#xD;
- Yes," replied I~ ~'I am here at last, nor do I intend to leave until you&#xD;
have made me reparation Ia some way for what -you have done. I de-&#xD;
termined you should not become aware of my pursuit this time until I&#xD;

"Ha I ha!" laughed the expiring woman, "I knew it last night, and&#xD;
had 1 noV been dying tbe~, 1~ would have slipped you again. But there&#xD;
is no need 9fthat pow, the tragedy is about to end, and in a way that&#xD;

I suppose you intended, with that polgnard.-~.which I recognize as the one&#xD;
I once plunged into the heart qf H~rb~rt Darnelle-.-I wish to say a few&#xD;
words to you."&#xD;
- The-frightful sangfroid of the wretch almost stunned me, and lower&#xD;
ing the~ point of my poignard, I simply replied:&#xD;
"Go on."&#xD;
"I will be brief," said Ann Rivel; "for my life is now numbered by mm-&#xD;
ute~. 'When I lived in New Orleans, ytf~r father, in conjunction with&#xD;
Herbert Darnelle, ruined my father in business by refusing a certain fa-&#xD;
~ror the latter asked for. The result was, that from affluence, my mother&#xD;
and I were reduced almost to beggary. She broke her heart and died&#xD;
soon after. I lived, and resolved to revenge myself on Herbert Darnelle&#xD;
and you. You th~e~n loved each other fervently. The men of today are&#xD;
not Josepbs, and I easily seduced Herbert.-~do you understand? I se-&#xD;
duced hhu and bec~nw his bauble-his mistress-in order that I might&#xD;

"l3ut my task was not complete. He loved you dearly and your child,&#xD;

Had it nQt~been for that German servant girl of yours, Lena Graef, you&#xD;
would have perished at the hands of Law and Justice! ha! ha!&#xD;
"I knew your vengeful disposition, and knew that when you escaped&#xD;
you would pursue me. So, like the Matador, I fled; always keeping close&#xD;
enough to you to find out exactly what you intended, and to keep you&#xD;
excited, and yet far enough from you to pi'event you fulfilling your&#xD;
threats. How long I might bavecontinued this I do not know. But I&#xD;
Was suddenly stricken with the disease that has brought me to this bed&#xD;
of death. I immediately resolved to come to this cottage, and here await&#xD;
your arrival. I expected you before this, and even began to fear that you&#xD;
would not come in time.&#xD;
"You have come hither for revenge and to recover your child; while I&#xD;
have brought you here for revenge and to-Oh! I die! pull - that bell&#xD;
cord! pill! pull! or you will not hear all I"&#xD;
The face of the dying woman was horr~b1y contorted. She gasped and&#xD;
&#xD;
struggled; and, almost unconsciously, I sprang close to her bed side and&#xD;
jerked the bell cord violently. A loud~ whirring sound followed, as&#xD;
though by the act I had started some kind of machinery.&#xD;
"Ha! ha!" exclaimed Ann Itivel, in a weak, choking voice; "it ~s as I&#xD;
wished. Below this chamber is a vault, is which there are a hundred&#xD;
pounds of gunpowder. With your own hand you have started the clock-&#xD;
work, which, in about twenty seconds more, will explode the magazine.&#xD;
With your own hand! and Eloise, your daughter, is locked in. the vault I&#xD;
Adieu! Revenge is&#xD;
Ann Rivel fell back dead, without finishing her sentences and~ with&#xD;
the calmness of despair, I stood immoveable, awaiting the dreadful death~&#xD;
Bhe had so surely and diabolically prepared~ for me and my darling.&#xD;
The whirring sound ceased, however, -and was followed by no explos-&#xD;
ion, and my. frigid despair instantly gave way to mere active ideas. I&#xD;
rushed swiftly from the chamber, and found the ~old hag of a servant reck-&#xD;
lug herself over the kitchen fire,&#xD;
"Woman 1" I cried wildly, seizing her and holding a revolver at her&#xD;
head. "Show me down into the vault where the child is! Quick! or I&#xD;
will shoot you."&#xD;
"Aye! that I will I" said she. "that woman must not know it though.&#xD;
But she cnn't move out of bed. Come, an~l you will bless me! Comet"&#xD;
She hobbled on before me with surprising speed for one so old, and,&#xD;
opening a trap door, went down some heavy oaken steps. I followed her&#xD;
closely, and shuddered as I felt the cold, damp, musty air come up out&#xD;
-of the opening. But this feeling was nothing~ compared to that which&#xD;
thrilled me as-I heard a child's voice groaYiing. My heart almost stood&#xD;
still! that was the voice of my sweet dating Eloise. Long, long ago&#xD;
bad it been since I last heard it.&#xD;
"Eloise! Eloise! my child! my dai'ling! Where are you? I ani yoi.tr&#xD;
mother! I am here to save you !" I cried. -&#xD;
At this moment the light that the old Woman carried was blown out&#xD;
by a strong current of air, and all was utter darkness. -At this moment. -&#xD;
too, I felt a, little body pressed against my own, and two little arms flung&#xD;
around me, and a little voice, weak and tr&amp;amp;nxbiing, saying'. ~'Mama! Oh!&#xD;
Mama!" -&#xD;
Oh, Heaven! could I, with this pen, trace on this parer my emotions&#xD;
at that instant, your very soul would thrill to read it, my dear friend.&#xD;
When, long before, Eloise had been torn from my embrace by the masked&#xD;
ruffians in New Orleans, she h'ad wailed forth -the self-same words that&#xD;
she now said: "Mama! Oh, llama 1" Then it had been in infantile des-&#xD;
pair;, now it was in childish gladness.&#xD;
I sank on my knees, and covered the dear, unseen face with kisses;&#xD;
and thanked Heaven, oh, how fervently; and almost crushed the darling&#xD;
in my happy embraces. By this time the old woman had relit her lamp,&#xD;
and bringing 11t close, enabled one to see the lineaments of little Eloise,&#xD;
the intended victim of that wicked woman, Ann Rivel.&#xD;
"Come! come, my sweetest ~ I exclaimed, catching Eloise np in my&#xD;
arms, let us be going.&#xD;
"Stop!" said the old woman, I told, you you would ble~s me. Come&#xD;
here and look."&#xD;
I followed her to the spot in the vault where ~tood a barrel, open at the&#xD;

down i'ito the barrel. She stopped and thrusting her hand into the bar-&#xD;
