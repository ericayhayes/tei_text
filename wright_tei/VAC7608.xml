Cl&amp;amp;ATER I.&#xD;
ox n.Or' Iwo.&#xD;
while the Federalgunboats were slowly push-&#xD;
ng through the dark passes of the YazcQ, in a&#xD;
brave attempt to reach the rear of Vicksburg,&#xD;
a young man called Felix Westerly, who had&#xD;
obtained  remission to accompany the expedi-&#xD;
tion, wandered too far from the protecting guns&#xD;
of the flotilla, and was'taken prisoner by sone&#xD;
Confederate soldiers.  Iasmed ately after his&#xD;
capture there was some discussion in regard to&#xD;
the treatment he should receive ; but le was&#xD;
flually marched off to plantation a short dis-&#xD;
tainee front the river, where, aftet being ironed,&#xD;
lie was thrust into a negro-cabin, and a guard&#xD;
placed over him. He had hoped for a rescue ;&#xD;
but the guns of the little  eet shelling the&#xD;
goodss growing less and less distinct, assured&#xD;
him that his friends were gradually receding,&#xD;
leaving him to captivity and its consequences.&#xD;
He felt indeed deserted when the Federal thun-&#xD;
ders ceased to be heard, and the most gloomy&#xD;
forebodings crowded upon him. He had every&#xD;
reason to fear the worst, for he had fallen into&#xD;
the hands of a notorious guerrilla chief; which&#xD;
fact, however, he did not fully understand at&#xD;
that time.&#xD;
'the night came on, but l elix Westerly could&#xD;
not-sleep. He turned restlessly on his bed of&#xD;
straw, and it was many hours before he lost the&#xD;
consciousness ofhis situation. At midnight he'&#xD;
was awakened by the touch of steel; a soldier&#xD;
was pricking him with his bayonet.&#xD;
Westerly arose as quickly as he couldgali&#xD;
seeing armed men at the door, thought hi jn$b&#xD;
hour had come.&#xD;
"«Murry him along,!" said an off'eer. " There&#xD;
is, no time to lose. Never mind his handcuffs;&#xD;
let him wear them; they won't hinder him from&#xD;
walking."&#xD;
"What is your rank, Sir t' asked Westerly,&#xD;
drcressing the petson who had spoken.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I hold the rank of Captain in the Confea&#xD;
erate service," he answered, readily.&#xD;
*I suspect for what purpose youhave called&#xD;
me," continued Westerly, moving slowly for-&#xD;
ward. "You must be aware, Sir, that a man&#xD;
wishes to make some preparation before taking&#xD;
a long journey. I trust I shall be allowed a few&#xD;
moments to say a few words. not only to my&#xD;
fellow-man, but to One infinitely higher."&#xD;
" Sergeant of the guard, take charge of the&#xD;
prisoner. Men, fall in. Right face I March I"&#xD;
Then to Westerly: " It is too late to mend a bad&#xD;
life, and too late to begin anew one. Five min-&#xD;
utes will scarcely suffice to change the mind of&#xD;
your judge. However, you shall not have cause&#xD;
to complain. Move on, Sergeant, according&#xD;
to orders."&#xD;
"It don't matter,"returned Westerly, pans-&#xD;
ing an instant. " I am no better than my coun,&#xD;
trymen who have fallen in this war ; but I may&#xD;
not die so well. If a fair woman should ever&#xD;
come this way, inquiring for her son, be kind&#xD;
enough to inform her.that Felix Westerly was&#xD;
murdered; will you Y"&#xD;
The young man was pushed forward rougbly&#xD;
by the soldiers, and the Rebel Captain did not&#xD;
reply. Westerly expected to, march but a few&#xD;
rods, but evidently three good miles were pass.&#xD;
ed over before the Sergeant halted his men.&#xD;
The young man saw before him the most pre&#xD;
tentious mansion he had seen in the region of&#xD;
the Yazoo. The plantation on which it stood&#xD;
was picturesque and beautiful. The soft moon-&#xD;
light, falling on the tropical scenery, bathed it&#xD;
in a silver radiance.&#xD;
Looking off to his right, he beheld a village&#xD;
of negro buts. . The "institution" had mani-&#xD;
festly flourished there in all its dark power and,&#xD;
glory. The happy owner of this Eden had-laid&#xD;
up for himself treasures on earth. A lazy, lux-&#xD;
urious air pervaded thespot.&#xD;
A few paces from the ,mansion was a buikting&#xD;
that might pass either for a ebapel or a prison,&#xD;

BARNABY, THE S&amp;amp;NDIIILLER..&#xD;
&#xD;
4          .       BARNABY, THE SANDHILLER.&#xD;
&#xD;
so far as outward signs went. Into this anom-&#xD;
alous place Westerly was marched. He had&#xD;
asked no'questions, and asked none now. Some&#xD;
massive doors were thrown open, and wonder-&#xD;
ing what next would happen, he passed'along a&#xD;
dimly-lighted ball, and soon found himself in a&#xD;
small and gloomy apartment, lighted by a sin-&#xD;
gle lamp placed in a niche at one side.&#xD;
The soldiers, at a sign from the Sergeant,&#xD;
filed to the right and left and passed out, leav-&#xD;
ing Westerly standing alone in the centre of&#xD;
the room. He looked thisway and that, in&#xD;
some expectation of seeing other captives.; but&#xD;
soon perceiving that he was the only occupant&#xD;
of the apartment, knew not what opinion to&#xD;
form. He turned in time to see the last knap-&#xD;
sack of his retisiig escort, and the closing of&#xD;
the stout door.&#xD;
If this is a prison," thought Westerly, "it&#xD;
is a very curious one."&#xD;
The ceiling was lofty, like that of a chapel,&#xD;
and there were two long, narrow windows, with&#xD;
iron shutters. Seeing a seat, and being much&#xD;
fatigued, he sat down to wait further develop-&#xD;
ments, and to shape his fancies, if possible, into&#xD;
something tangible. The irons were yet on his&#xD;
wrists, which were chafed and swollen. Feeling&#xD;
himself powerless, he tried to exercise the vir-&#xD;
tue of patience, and bear his mistrortunes man-&#xD;
fully.&#xD;
Some minutes passed silently. It occurred to&#xD;
him that perhaps this time had been allowed&#xD;
him for a brief preparation for the last scene in&#xD;
human life. While this conjecture was disturb-&#xD;
ing him, a side-door was opened, and a man&#xD;
advanced into the middle of the room, and af-&#xD;
ter looking at Westerly a nkoment, walked to&#xD;
the niche, took the lamp from it, and again ap-&#xD;
proached Westerly, who eyed this unexpected&#xD;
visitor suspiciously. He was a middle-aged&#xD;
person, with a stooping figure, thin face, piere-&#xD;
ing eyes, and gray hair. He was of low stature,&#xD;
and plainly'dressed. His mouth indicated great&#xD;
firmness and decision of character.&#xD;
He examined Westerly closely.  When he&#xD;
had completed this mute survey, he returned&#xD;
the lamp to the niche, rang a bell, and sat&#xD;
down. In answer to the summons, the door&#xD;
was opened, and the Sergeant looked in.&#xD;
" Take off his handcuffs," said the man.&#xD;
Without reply, the Sergeant relieved Wester-&#xD;
ly of the irons, and retired.&#xD;
" What is your name, young Sir?" asked the&#xD;
person who rang the bell,&#xD;
Westerly answered the question promptly.&#xD;
"You are a Federal?"&#xD;
"I am proud to say that I am,"replied West-&#xD;
His gray-bearded interlocutor frowned.&#xD;
" In what capacity did you accompany the&#xD;
gunboats in this Yankee experiment I"&#xD;
"Merely as a looker-on."&#xD;
' You wear 'the Federal color, I observe ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" The national blue," said Westerly, hisbloodi&#xD;
suddenly warming--" the national blue foray&#xD;
ever l"&#xD;
" Many wear it to, our malarious swaps,&#xD;
who never wear it avfay again."&#xD;
"Brave men sleep well in swamps., Wher-&#xD;
ever they lie their names will be cherished, an-&#xD;
swered Westerly, with spirit.&#xD;
" What is your rank in the besieging army ?"&#xD;
The man looked at him 'keenly. Westerly&#xD;
hesitated a moment, then replied :&#xD;
"I 'lave no particular rank. I am an agent."&#xD;
"Wat kind of an agent ?" persisted his&#xD;
questioner, brusquely. "This is mere evasion.&#xD;
Let me tell you that you are waited for outside.&#xD;
This is, very possibly, your last conversation.&#xD;
I mean to say that you are in great danger."&#xD;
" I am aware of that," said Westerly, seri-&#xD;
ously.&#xD;
" A spy is an agent," observed the other. You&#xD;
are probably one of those secret Government&#xD;
agents whom nobody understands, and by whom&#xD;
many suffer. However, we will not dwell upon&#xD;
that.  It will make little difference to you&#xD;
whether you are shot as a spy or as an agent.*"&#xD;
"Very little," answered the prisoner, impres-&#xD;
sively. "If I am to be murdered, one preteist&#xD;
will do as well as another for the crime. I ain&#xD;
a prisoner of war, and demand to be treated as&#xD;
such. If you have any influence, it is your&#xD;
duty to use it in my favor ; your duty as a&#xD;
Christian and a man. You have asked me sew-&#xD;
eral questions, which I have answered. Now,,&#xD;
the one great question that' interests me is the&#xD;
question of life and death. All others look&#xD;
small to me. I confess that I wish to live, and&#xD;
that death is grim  and unwelcome. I am&#xD;
full of life and health, and my business seems&#xD;
to be in this world rather than in the other."&#xD;
"Very true," responded his inquisitor, " ands&#xD;
you shall settle that question yourself."&#xD;
" It is, soon settled, then," returned Felix,&#xD;
quickly, and with a faint smile.&#xD;
" We shall see, Sir," retorted the man, frigid-&#xD;
ly. "Give me your whole attention."&#xD;
He arose, and approached Westerly, and the'&#xD;
power of his gray eyes for the first time be-&#xD;
came manifest to him. He showed a stony&#xD;
face, traversed by hard intersecting lines.&#xD;
" One thing is certain," he continued, "with-&#xD;
out my aid, you will be shot at daylight, which-&#xD;
is close at hand, in retaliation. for several sum-&#xD;
mary executions by the Federals. You were&#xD;
taken by a band of men called guerrillas, whose&#xD;
ranks have recently been -thinned by Yankee&#xD;
rifles and halters. Their warfare being some-&#xD;
what irregular, the .fact has been seized upon&#xD;
by our enemies, and the few prisoners they&#xD;
have captured have been treated to short shrifts&#xD;
and sure cords. There is a balance of hangin&#xD;
and shooting against us, and you will help pay&#xD;
it, provided you reject the' proposition I am&#xD;
about to make. I state the matter clearly, its&#xD;
&#xD;
order that you may see that but two things are&#xD;
before you." .&#xD;
"If am in the hands of the swamp bandit-&#xD;
ti, I know very well what to expect 1" exclaimed&#xD;
Westerly, in a.desponding tone.&#xD;
"I am   glad to hear you say so. Listen.&#xD;
One startling thing that is before you, you al-&#xD;
ready know: it is death. The other is, mar-&#xD;
rage.."&#xD;
Felix Westerly sprang from his chair. His&#xD;
blood rushed to. his face ; his mouth opened ;&#xD;
his nostrils dilated. The seriousness with which&#xD;
the gray-bearded man spoke left no room to&#xD;
doubt his sincerity. In some manner, every&#xD;
word. he uttered carried conviction with it. He&#xD;
was absolutely a person not given to jesting.&#xD;
He was one born to authority, and to whomeon-&#xD;
tradietion was indignity.&#xD;
"Marriage !" repeated Westerly, confounded.&#xD;
" Marriage !" reiterated the other, in a steady,&#xD;
unswerving voice. " Choose quickly."&#xD;
"Really, I am not prepared," stammered Fe-&#xD;
li. "Marriage requires courtship, and all that&#xD;
sort of thing."&#xD;
"Reflect a minute or two."&#xD;
The wan took out his watch and looked at the&#xD;
dial.&#xD;
" Are you seriously in earnest ?" asked West-&#xD;
erly.&#xD;
"I have been in earnest all my life, and&#xD;
never more so than to-night," was the instant&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"Will you tell me your name ?" gasped Fe-&#xD;
lir. -&#xD;
"Names are of small consequence to you.&#xD;
My name is Borrowscale. I am a cotton-plant-&#xD;
er. - The young lady.now offered to you for a,&#xD;
wife has no striking personal defects. She isi&#xD;
thought fair by many, and some. persons have&#xD;
called her- handsome.  She is just eighteen.C&#xD;
What do you say ?"&#xD;
Felix sat down, quite overpowered.&#xD;
" Give me eight or ten days -to think of it,"&#xD;
he said, rather at random.&#xD;
" Searcely as many minutes !" answered Bor-&#xD;
rowscale, abruptly.&#xD;
"Sir, this is very sudden, and, I must say,&#xD;
very singular," faltered Felix. "It is awkwardly&#xD;
unfortunate that I made up my mind, years go, &#xD;
to leave women and marriage altogether out of&#xD;
my life. The truth is, that I have an unac- s&#xD;
countable antipathy to the sex. Propose some- e&#xD;
thing else;'I beg."                         s&#xD;
if Very well, Sir! I'll ring for the Sergeant," ft&#xD;
said Borrowscale, sternly.                  ti&#xD;
" Not yet! notyet l! entreated Felix. "Who f&#xD;
Is this person whom you wish me to marry ?"&#xD;
"My    daughter,"  answered  Borrowseale, o&#xD;
grimly.                                     u&#xD;
" Your daughter I" echoed Westerly, me-&#xD;
ahanically.                                w&#xD;
Borrowseale bowed stiffly. .              a&#xD;
" Was her mother-"r&#xD;
&#xD;
" You are not to marry the mother, but the&#xD;
daughter," interposed Borrowscale. " What&#xD;
matters the condition of the mother, if the&#xD;
daughter be fair and rich,? You Northerners&#xD;
are humanitarians and philosophers."&#xD;
Fe spoke sneeringly, and,his eyes glittered.&#xD;
Westerly's heart misgave him.&#xD;
".I--I am already married,". he stammered,&#xD;
resorting to a lie.&#xD;
" Then it only remains for you 'to be shot I"&#xD;
said Borrowecale, frowning, and ringing the&#xD;
bell.&#xD;
The Sergeant appeared.&#xD;
" Sergeant, this young man is ready to go'&#xD;
with you. Let me hear the report of your guns&#xD;
very soon."&#xD;
"Send   him  back !"  exclaimed  Westerly,&#xD;
yielding to the. terrors of the moment. " Die-&#xD;
miss those assassins.. I accept your terms."&#xD;
" Go !" said Borrowseale, with a scornful curl&#xD;
of the lips.&#xD;
The Sergeant went out,as automatically as he&#xD;
had come in.&#xD;
"You will marry the girl that I shall bring&#xD;
to you ?"&#xD;
."I will! But how am Ito be assured that it&#xD;
will profit me ? .I may be taken out and treach-&#xD;
erously murdered immediately after the cere-&#xD;
mony," said Felix, not satisfied.&#xD;

safety, and you must take my word for it.&#xD;
Your position is such that you cannot afford to&#xD;
be exacting. You have reason to congratulate&#xD;
yourself on your good fortune."&#xD;
"Shall I be set at liberty ?"&#xD;
"Ask no more, unless.you wish the company&#xD;
of the Sergeant," replied Borrowscale, mean-&#xD;
ingly.&#xD;
".I am yours," said Westerly, " and you can&#xD;
do.as you please. When is the thing to be ?"&#xD;
" Immediately."&#xD;
Borrowseale rapped at the side-door. A&#xD;
negro opened it.&#xD;
"Go and tell her to come," said Borrowseale.&#xD;
The black 'went away, but soon thrust his&#xD;
head into the apartment, and said:&#xD;
"She won't, Mars'r."&#xD;
"Remain here," said the planter to Westerly.&#xD;
Your bride is not quite ready."&#xD;
Felix was left alone again. Thigiehad taken&#xD;
uch a.- singular turn, that he now felt more&#xD;
curiosity than fear. He began to realize the&#xD;
trangeness of the adventure. Although he&#xD;
elt unprepared for matrimony, he concluded&#xD;
hat it was better tlan the startling alternative.&#xD;
or which he was equally unprepared.&#xD;
'- Death, however," he muttered, "is soon&#xD;
ver; but marriage is a lingering fate, full of&#xD;
iitold perplexities."&#xD;
He was alone- fifteen Minutes, communing&#xD;

who visits her secretly and you cannot imagine&#xD;
'rhat a trouble'yn-'d be !"'&#xD;
"So my wife has a lover 9" He raised his&#xD;
voice purposely, as he had done several times&#xD;
during this singular conversation. He listened,&#xD;
'1too, with hisear turned toward the open door.&#xD;
He heard no scratching of pen upon paper.&#xD;
Was the new Mrs.'Weterly willing to hear what&#xD;
was being said? "I lose sight of my own rais-,&#xD;
fortunes in view of hers. - A husband, in the&#xD;

He- spoke pretty loudly. Esther, who was&#xD;
standing nearest the door, tripped to the thresh-&#xD;
old, and glanced in at her mistress. She had&#xD;
stopped writing, and her manner indicated that&#xD;
she-had heard frequent allusions to herself.&#xD;
"'I am  glad y ou are 'so reasonable," said&#xD;
Esther, returning. " You are not sb wicked as&#xD;
'we thought you were. If you are not treacher-&#xD;

"Saved I" muttered Felix. angrily.  "Per-&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
TH    SITUATION.&#xD;
Esther returned, by and by, less pert an&amp;amp;&#xD;
more serious.    :    --&#xD;
"My- mistress is glad that you have sense&#xD;
enough to wish to escape. She says that the&#xD;
more'faithfully you forget her, and the farther&#xD;
you are:off, the better she will'like you."&#xD;
1 The girl stopped, and seeing that she had left&#xD;
the door ajar. hastened'to shut it,,remarking :s&#xD;
",Your voice disturbs her very much. She&#xD;
thinks it harsh and disagreeable."&#xD;
" I beg her pardon for my voice, I am sure,"&#xD;
said Felix, his vanity considerably wounded ;&#xD;
for he prided himself on his'voice. "I hope she&#xD;
will be spared hearing it 'overmuch. Perhaps&#xD;
she had better put cotton in her ears."&#xD;
" The probability is, that she will have to bear&#xD;
it several hours, unless you muster courage to&#xD;
try the window. My mistress says, that in all&#xD;
the books she has read, she hasn't found an in-&#xD;
stance where a gentleman broke his limbs by&#xD;
jumping from a window."&#xD;
" Your mistress is very good to mention it. I&#xD;
was. fortunate in 'being wedded. to a lady of&#xD;
so much forethought. Should I remain here-&#xD;
twenty-four' hours I shall be curious to see'her&#xD;
charming face. Her eyes beam with-tenderness,&#xD;
I know I" continued Felix, with an expression&#xD;
of countenance that made Esther smile.&#xD;
Thus far the girl had scarcely deigned to&#xD;
notice him ; but now she began a survey of his&#xD;
person. She found him'shapely anl of pleasing&#xD;
face. She secretly admitted that he had manly&#xD;
beauty-no trifling possession, in her opinion.&#xD;
An - octoroon he was not, whatever he might&#xD;
say: to the contrary. This, with other tales,&#xD;
she regarded as inventions of the moment. He&#xD;
found favor in* Esther's eyes. Concealing the&#xD;
softening of her prejudices, she added: "You&#xD;
are to stay here until after dark, when you are,&#xD;
in some way, to be got rid of."&#xD;
" It would have saved some hunger and thirst,&#xD;
if I had been delivered over to the Sergeant last&#xD;
night. You eee it would haie been all over by&#xD;
this time. But this thing is not all over. Mar-&#xD;
riage is never soon over," sighed Felix.&#xD;
You ought to be grateful to my mistress,&#xD;
Sir, for saving your life," said Esther, sharply."&#xD;
"You would be underground now, if it hadn't&#xD;
been for her. You ought to be on your knees,&#xD;
thanking the saints and other things for not- be-&#xD;
ing.a dead Yankee."'&#xD;
"'here is some show of reason in that," an-&#xD;
swered Felix, reflectively. "Tell your mistress&#xD;
that I am her slave', and humbly wait-her com-&#xD;
mands."&#xD;
Westerly bowed very low to, Esther, as the&#xD;
present representative of his bride.&#xD;
"I can't take that elegant bow to Mistress&#xD;
Diana, but I'll repeat what you have said," said&#xD;
Esther.&#xD;
f' Add that I am hungry," amended Felix.&#xD;
&#xD;
BARINABY, THE SAND1IILLER.&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;amp;'I am going to tell Old Sut to bing you&#xD;
something. If you's in love with my distress,&#xD;
you wouldn't be hungry, I'll warrant. Ab, Sir,&#xD;
between you and I, secretly, she's as handsome&#xD;
as she can be ! You'l never, never see such a&#xD;
face and form as hers."&#xD;
" Don't talk of other faces," returned Felix.&#xD;
",You have a pretty face yourself. I confess I&#xD;
like that faint and blushing yellow."'&#xD;
" 0 Sir I You are' flattering the maid in-&#xD;
stead of the mistress. 'Remember that you are&#xD;
a married man, and have a wife in the next&#xD;
room, beside, whose lovelings niy own stained&#xD;
cheeks are like dead leaves to living roses. But&#xD;
it is wasting breath to talk of it. She is suffer-&#xD;
ing martyrdom, and she hates you."&#xD;
-  No need; of that !" muttered Felix. Being&#xD;
mutually anxious to get away from each other,&#xD;
I see no reason for hatred.".&#xD;
Esther was going slowly from the room, when&#xD;
Felix stopped her.&#xD;
" Look here, girlI A thought has occurred to&#xD;
me.. I have a servant, who is a very wonderful&#xD;
fellow, who would be of great use. to me if I&#xD;
could manage to communicate with him. He's&#xD;
an inhabitant of this part of the country, too,&#xD;
and familiar with the plantations within a,eir-&#xD;
cuit of twenty miles.  left him on a gunboat;&#xD;
but I'll wager he didn't stay there long after I&#xD;
was missed."&#xD;
"You can't expect me to run after him !"&#xD;
said Esther,, tossing her head."&#xD;
" Certainly not!" answered Felix, with in&#xD;
mense politeness. "But then if I should pay&#xD;
you for =your time and friendship, you would&#xD;
perhaps condescend to inform me if you shouild-&#xD;
see an eccentrie-looking fellow hanging about&#xD;
the plantation. Guards being set about this&#xD;
house, and every military precaution..taken to&#xD;
prevent my escape, you will perceive that it is&#xD;
not going, to be an easy matter to rid your&#xD;
mistress of a husband and myself of a, wife ;&#xD;
and any assistance that we can secure. from&#xD;
without, is to be sought and accepted. My poor&#xD;
Barnaby will track me, I doubt not. but he will&#xD;
scarcely have skill to reach me. Besides, he&#xD;
has reason to avoid contact with the Rebels ;&#xD;
recognition would be fatal to him." -&#xD;
" Then he'd better keep away," advised Es-&#xD;
ther. "Master Borrowscale is dreadful hard on&#xD;
them as don't go into the ranks and fight. If&#xD;
your Barnaby comes spyin' around, he'll get&#xD;
his throat tickled with a cotton rope, like as&#xD;
not. Them as is called guerrillas has strung&#xD;
up a many of white folks for just notliin' at all,&#xD;
except refusin' to 'list." With these not very&#xD;
consoling remarks, Esther left the room ; and&#xD;
shortly afterward, Old Sut entered, spread a&#xD;
cloth upon a small table, laid two covers, then&#xD;
brought a tray ofrefreshments.&#xD;
Felix eyed the two covers suspiciously. Old&#xD;
Sut performed his duties silently, now and then&#xD;
stealing an inquiring look at Westerly.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&amp;amp;:&#xD;
&#xD;
This negro had a peculiar expression. His&#xD;
face was not black, but of a deep yellow. His&#xD;
skin was singularly bright and glossy.  His&#xD;
cheeks were, sunken, his lips thin, the' white&#xD;
teeth standing out a little, bt't not enough to.&#xD;
give a marked Africai look. His nose', was&#xD;
rather flat. , His. eyes brilliant, with" a&#xD;
broad, high forehead, around which his white'&#xD;
wool clustered in f,' striking manner.    -&#xD;
though past middle age, he was, yet full' of"%i;&#xD;
tity and strength.' When he looked at- one,&#xD;
he seemed to question his thoughts, and' had&#xD;
a remarkable way of making "himself useful&#xD;
without being obtrusive. He had a grace air;&#xD;
and seldom laughed. , He was a very serious&#xD;
chattel... His name was Suttle'; but he'va.&#xD;
called Sut, and finally, as years came upon him,&#xD;
Old Sut.&#xD;
He was remarkably reticent, and his e6nfi.&#xD;
deuces were supposed, by his fellow-slaves, to&#xD;
be few. ,He might have been given to brooding&#xD;
and ,misanthropy; but he troubled nobody with&#xD;
the inner workings of hie mind.. If he haid&#xD;
loves, or griefs, or hatreds, few could boast a&#xD;
knowledge of them. 'In the eyes of Borrow-&#xD;
scale, lie had one failing ; he knew too much..&#xD;
He could actually read and write;' therefore be&#xD;
was jealously watched ; but, conducted himself&#xD;
so pr -dently that no great wickedness, iuch as&#xD;
might be expected to cone of reading and writ-&#xD;
ing, had yet been laid to his charge. Since the&#xD;
breaking out of the Rebellion, his stern master&#xD;
had kept him more severely under serutin', but&#xD;
without making startling discoveries. Thehe&#xD;
matters Felix learned afterward, and not from&#xD;
immediate observation. All the time he was&#xD;
laying the little table, he was obviously sthdy-&#xD;
ing the character and countenance of Westerly;&#xD;
but with so much tact that the latter felt no&#xD;
annoyance. He resolved to' ask 'Esther if Old.&#xD;
gut could be trusted.&#xD;
4" What are your politics ?" said Felix, turn.&#xD;
ing upon him abruptly.&#xD;
" Mars'r's polities is mine," answered the ne-&#xD;
gro, with a servile bow.&#xD;
"Very discreet 'indeed," said Felix. "Su-&#xD;
pose that your, master should change his poli-&#xD;
tics suddenly ?"&#xD;
" Mars'r is allus right, and I should change,&#xD;
too," answered Sut, humbly. "A poor' nig&#xD;
mustn't know more'n white folks."&#xD;
" In slavery, obedience is happiness," said&#xD;
Felix, looking steadily at the black. " If' I&#xD;
were a slave, I would eringe'and bow, and do&#xD;
what I was,- bidden. A thing must not try to&#xD;
act like a man."&#xD;
"'True, Masr'r. Thatyer is Gospel truth to.&#xD;
niggers. How is the' Yanks gittia' along at&#xD;
Vicksburg, Ma'rs'r?" added the black.   He&#xD;
threw a sly glance at Felix, but kept on witir&#xD;
his work.&#xD;

said Felix, quietly.' "They bring you back,&#xD;

Esther bounced out of the-, room, in ill-&#xD;

Old Sut answered the bell..&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
HOW TO GET 'OUT.&#xD;
Felix Westerly watched the bondman closely&#xD;
as he silently performed his 'duties. He was&#xD;
trying to decide whether he -could ,make a friend&#xD;
of him. He judged ,by what Esther .had. said&#xD;
that she was not inclined to make'him a sharer&#xD;
of her secrets ; but he differed from the yellow&#xD;
maid in his estimate-of Sut's character. While&#xD;
she took a superficial view, he:looked deeper,&#xD;
and finally'resolved to make friendly advances&#xD;
to the.black..              --, ,&#xD;
"You ate called Old Sut?" said Felix, by-&#xD;
and-by. t-- .=&#xD;
Y;ea, Mars 'r." .-&#xD;
" Can you be trusted ?" continued Felix..,&#xD;
"Some can trust me, and some can't,".replied&#xD;
But, ambiguously.  "Thar's them I wouldn't&#xD;
advise to. try it. Slaves can't keep secrets,&#xD;
nohow."&#xD;
-" I'm a prisoner," added Felix, seriously.&#xD;
A prisoner under singular circumstances. I&#xD;
have reason to think that:,my life is in danger.&#xD;
I must escape. I must leave this house."&#xD;
He watched ,the effect of 'his words on Old&#xD;
Sut, who'listened respectfully., ,  . .&#xD;
" Yes, Mars'r, you must leave this yer house.&#xD;
I 'spect I'm a Rebble, but I don't mind sayin'&#xD;
that you must git a*ay."-&#xD;
"'Tell me bow," said Felix, quickly. -&#xD;
&#xD;
The negro shook his head.&#xD;
' rMars'r, open that blind Snd look out' orthat&#xD;
yer winder, and see what ye kin see."&#xD;
"Some shelter-tents, and "soldiers 'lolling in&#xD;
the sun' Were they sent up from 'Vicksburg ?"&#xD;
" No, Mara' ; ',they never war thar. Thar's&#xD;
a heap of 'em up and down the river, thatiwar&#xD;
never in the reg'har line'of'sojerin'. -If you's to&#xD;
look on .t'othei' side,-you'd 'see more of 'em.&#xD;
They'rehere jest'to look Frter the Yanikees, and&#xD;
take:k'eer o' thereotton. 1 Tie Feds,.Mars'r says,&#xD;

want 'outtoti, why don't they grow it; -and if&#xD;
they wan't slaves, 'whyldnn't, they'raise 'em, like&#xD;
we do ? But as I's sayin', Mars'r, 'how you&#xD;

sharpest anal faithffuiest if 'em all' is the over-&#xD;
seer, who has his orders d'rect "from Mars'r&#xD;
Borrerseale hisself, and knows all that's gwine&#xD;
on on this-plantation. Thar's whar the trouble&#xD;
is,"-continued Sut,'with a subdued air and voice,&#xD;
keeping one eye on the door, and another c'&#xD;
the freighted tray before him.&#xD;
"Is he cunning ?" asked Felix.&#xD;
"I'm a Rebble, and you mustn't speet no'&#xD;
syinpathy'from me; but I. tell ye, Sah, he am&#xD;
as-cunning as the Ol Nick hisself. He's: hand&#xD;
on the f eldihands ;' and Phar'oh's heart, which&#xD;
the Lord hardened,was butter compared to his'n.&#xD;
His lieart" was never softened torrard a black&#xD;
skin. - I've seen. sights that'd"'make ye sick ?&#xD;
They are all skeered of him, and hate him&#xD;
mighty bad. Now,how you gwine to git away ?&#xD;
You're as safe, Mars'r,.as a rat in a rat-trap.'&#xD;
'A! Should you 'be afraid to assist me in th.&#xD;
night.?" asked Felix, cautiously.&#xD;
',"Toomuchrisk," answered But, gravely.&#xD;
"You a can go: with me.. Once aboard of a&#xD;
gunboatp and ' you can, shake your finger defi-&#xD;
antly at Absalom Wills."'&#xD;
",The-time hasn't come yet, I'm afeard. I&#xD;
must stay. whar my. work 'is," said But, re-&#xD;
flectively. :" But I'll think,'bout it, Mars'r," he&#xD;
added.&#xD;
" You will, at least, be silent?"&#xD;
"Never fear, Sah; never fear! If I don't&#xD;
help ye,.I won't put nothing ' in the way," re-&#xD;
sponded the black, with earnestness.&#xD;
 I have a white :servant,' continued Felix,&#xD;
hesitatingly, "who is much attached to me;&#xD;
and who may, in his foolish zeal to find me, get&#xD;
into difficulty."&#xD;
"Describe him, Mars'r."&#xD;
"It is difficult," replied Westerly. "He is&#xD;
tall-and s'im, and goes stooping; 'is awkward in&#xD;
his movements, but makes up in assurance what&#xD;
he lacks in grace. His face is good-humored,&#xD;
and his eyes full of drollery. His hair is light&#xD;

"Mars'r," answered ,i But., after ,a pause,&#xD;
" yoti lave trustedme, and ypu're the first white&#xD;
man that ever done it."  e walked softly to&#xD;
the dor, then came laek, andaded: "You've&#xD;

'and you looks sharp afore you leap. Your&#xD;
Chances won't be no worse for what you've tole&#xD;

thar's a heap o' hatred. Have ye spoke to&#xD;

"We have not spoken--except through&#xD;
Esther. She lies promised her aid. What is&#xD;
ihe object of this singular proceeding?"&#xD;
"The marriage, Sah 9 Don't ask me !" an-&#xD;
swered Sut, drawing back in alarm.   "I'm&#xD;
wine, Mars'r. I've talked too much; and if&#xD;
Absalom Wills knowed what has passed atween&#xD;
us, you wouldn't never see this white head o'&#xD;
mine agin in the Lor's world."&#xD;
Old But took ip his tray with some trepida.&#xD;
tion. Felix followed him to the door, and&#xD;
asked, in a whisper :&#xD;
" Is she white :"&#xD;
The negro looked, at the questioner queerly,&#xD;
shrugged his shoulders, and was about to an-&#xD;
suer, when footsteps were heard in the hall.&#xD;
Westerly walked to the other side of the room,&#xD;
while Sut went out with the tray.&#xD;
Felix now had time to reflect on the situation.&#xD;
Several' important events bad happened. ,He&#xD;
had been captured by the enemy ; his. life had&#xD;
,been in danger ; he had been married. These&#xD;
were not trifling matters ; either one.of them&#xD;
was enough to make a man serious.. The peril,&#xD;
it appeared, was by no means past. He wasyet a&#xD;
prisoner, subject to many unpleasant contin.&#xD;
agencies. The woman to whom he had been so&#xD;
strangely united, was in the next room. He had&#xD;
not seen her face, scarcely herd her voice, and,&#xD;
had but a very vague idea of ler person. Like&#xD;
two strange pigeons, they were shut up together&#xD;
and expected to mate. All this was.very ex-&#xD;
ti-aordinary. He could find nosatisfactory mo&#xD;
tive for the marriage, so far as the father of the'&#xD;
bride was concerned. He suspected that her&#xD;
birth and blood had something to do, with it.&#xD;
Whatever the moving cause was, ib was much&#xD;
like those incredible tales so charmingly told in&#xD;
4he Arabian Nights. -&#xD;
&#xD;
.Iis bride, it seemed, was greatly averse to the&#xD;
unlover-like proceeding, which rendered it more&#xD;
ir.comprehensible. He shrank from the posil-&#xD;
bility of yellow blood. Possibly, Eorrowscale&#xD;
wished to elevate iis daughter by this eonness&#xD;
tion, and, so take Away her, reproach. But he&#xD;
was not, inclined to, thank him for the ofspring&#xD;
of an illicit relationship.&#xD;
Escape was an imperative necessity. How&#xD;
should 'it be accomplished ? The iald. would&#xD;
assist, the mistress ,would. assist, and -he believed&#xD;
that Old gut would render useful aids That was&#xD;
promising, so far as it went; but he felt an in-&#xD;
stinctive dread of Absalom Wills and Borrow.&#xD;
scale.&#xD;
H  walked to and fro, examined the doors and&#xD;
the windows, and tried to calculate the distance&#xD;
to the ground. He opened a shutter. Imme-&#xD;
diately a pane was shattered, and the report of&#xD;
a rifle followed. Felix fell down, not very hard,&#xD;
but with sufficient Clatter to bring Esther from&#xD;
the next room, in haste. She found the young&#xD;
man lying motionless on his side, with hi! left&#xD;
arm flexe4 comfortably under his head. Thorp&#xD;
was a little smutch of blood og his vest. His&#xD;
eyes were closed, and his face was rather calm&#xD;
for one so recently shot.&#xD;
'The bride came to the door, and looked in.&#xD;
Felix stole a glance, at her from under his hypo-&#xD;
critical lids ; but if lie meant to see her face by&#xD;
cunning, he was mistaken, for mistress and maid&#xD;
had been busy with needle and' scissors, and&#xD;
pasteboard and silk, and the mask had been&#xD;
made, which Diana was trying on at the very&#xD;
moment of the accident. She appeared to Felix&#xD;
with this wonderful contrivance, concealing&#xD;
every feature. All lie could see of her counte-&#xD;
mance was the vague brightness of two dark eyes.&#xD;
He was foiled. Miss Diana was evidently in&#xD;
earnest in her purpose not to be seen; but she&#xD;
was fluttered and agitated, as women always are&#xD;
when accidents occur.&#xD;
Esther was also startled. She contemplated&#xD;
the prostrate figure with pale cheeks. ter first&#xD;
exclamation was:&#xD;
"Gracious goodness, Mis tDiana, I do believe&#xD;
he's dead I"&#xD;
A very brief pause.&#xD;
" There's no more color in his cheeks than in&#xD;
white paper," she added, which was an e agger-&#xD;
ation, for his cheeks were browner than her own.&#xD;
"What a dreadful tithing I" murmured her&#xD;
mistress softly approaching.&#xD;
Felix lifted his drooped lids enough to see the&#xD;
feet of his wife. In diminutiveness they match-&#xD;
ed her hands.&#xD;
"See the blood!" sighed Esther.&#xD;
The mistress was cooler than the maid.&#xD;
" Spesk to Lim, Esther ; speak to him I" she&#xD;
said. " He does not look very dead, I am sure."&#xD;
"0,. Mistress, hpw e a yo  any, soI" cried&#xD;
Esther, whose judgment ha gpne. " is face&#xD;

man to look at. I never set my eyes on a de-&#xD;
center looking' gentleman ; for he was a gentle-'&#xD;
man, I do think. You'd ought to bearn him&#xD;
talk to me, when lie dropped his voice down&#xD;
low and soft, and was right smart in earnest."&#xD;
Another interval of silence.&#xD;
Esther took hold of his shoulder and gave&#xD;
hin a little shake.. Felix made no sign of life.&#xD;
She shook him more roughly.&#xD;
"Put your hand on his heart," suggested the&#xD;
mistress.&#xD;
"Lord, Miss,! I don't know where a man's&#xD;
heart is. If he'4 san you, I'd know where to&#xD;
look for it right well," returned Esther, growing&#xD;
bolder, kneeling beside Felix, and touching his&#xD;
forehead.                              .&#xD;
The deceiver sighed, and thought it prudent'&#xD;
to be reviving.               liti pre&#xD;
"Bring some water," said Diana, bending&#xD;
over Felix, and observing him closely.&#xD;
Esther brought camphor instead of water.&#xD;
"Here is no loss of blood," added Diana.&#xD;
" He 'is but stunned. If there is bleeding, it' is'&#xD;
internal. lis countenance is fresh and life-like,&#xD;
and not ghastly, as you said." Her band glided&#xD;
to his wrist, and her soft fingers pressed his&#xD;
pulse. The conscious blood thrilled through&#xD;
his veins. His hypocrisy was in danger of ex-&#xD;
posure..&#xD;
Esther spilled some camphor into his eyes&#xD;
and nose. He started co, ivulsively, but not till&#xD;
Diana had felt his heart throbs swelling very&#xD;
regularly under her sensitive fingers. He rais-&#xD;
ed himself upon his elbow and made a dash at&#xD;
his eyes with his right 'hand, for they smarted&#xD;
painfully.&#xD;
The masked lady stepped back quickly and&#xD;
suspiciously. Had she dropped her mask, one&#xD;
could have seen a carmine flush upon her cheek.&#xD;
She glanced at the shattered pane, and itneeded&#xD;
that reality to assure her that anything serious&#xD;
had happened. Her eyes, traveling back in a&#xD;
line with the broken pane, saw where the mis-&#xD;
sile or ball had struck the table and glanced off&#xD;
into the wall.&#xD;
"It is not so bad as!T feared," shesaid. "Here&#xD;
is where the shot hit the table. It could not&#xD;
have passed through his lungs."&#xD;
Felix felt rebuked.&#xD;
"Lend me your arm, Esther," he stammered.&#xD;
and, with her help, arose to his feet. " I beg&#xD;
your pardon; Madam," he added, "for any&#xD;
alarm I may have'eaused you. I believe I am&#xD;
not seriously hurt."&#xD;
Diana bent her head coldly.&#xD;
"For shame, to make believe I" exclaimed&#xD;
Esther, derisively.&#xD;
"I am indebted for safety, I think," continued&#xD;
Felix, -coloring, and drawing 'forth 'his watch,&#xD;
"to this."  There was a lead-colored furrow,&#xD;
along the case.&#xD;
Dianabowed with a trifl6 less stateliness.&#xD;
" A the'uesad pardons, Madam, for causing&#xD;
&#xD;
you a moment's -uneasiness. I am sure yo.&#xD;
must be disappointed at so slight an injury ;.&#xD;
'but I presented a fair mark, and I cannot help&#xD;
it. Blame the watch, Madam, and not me."&#xD;
Diana 'remained silent, and looked at her&#xD;
maid.&#xD;
"Mv mistress isn't wicked, Sir, nor never-&#xD;
was," said the latter, elevating her nose. "I&#xD;
wai-ned' ye to keep away from the window."&#xD;
"Madam," said Felix, with' empressement,&#xD;
"there is no more doubt of your goodness'&#xD;
than of your beauty. Positively, I think you&#xD;
an angel ; but I, being a common sort of crea-&#xD;
ture, am not fitted for your society ; and, there-&#xD;
fore, am magnanimous enough to wish to leave'&#xD;
you' by any gate, except that of death. I did&#xD;
practice deception, with the intention of surpris-&#xD;
ing you' and seeing your face, and make the'&#xD;
only atonemnlit in. my power by voluntary&#xD;
confession. It is not a crime for a man to wish&#xD;
to see his wife."    '&#xD;
"A small device," murmured Diana.&#xD;
" But the blood ?" queried Esther, as some,&#xD;
drops trickled from the ends of his fingers.&#xD;
" A slight cut in the arm made by a fragment&#xD;
of glass," answered .Felix. He rolled up his&#xD;
sleeve as he spoke, and showed an arm white an&#xD;
a woman's.'- The ball had grazed it in passing,&#xD;
and lacerated the flesh. Esther's interest re-&#xD;
vived.&#xD;
"Give me your handkerchief, Miss Diana,"'&#xD;
she said. " See how he bleeds!"&#xD;
" Take your dwn I" retorted the mistress.&#xD;
The girl fumbled in her apron-pockets, but&#xD;
could not find one.&#xD;
"It's of no consequence" said Felix, loftily.&#xD;
"I have been in battles, where such scratches:&#xD;
are laughed at."&#xD;
With some reluctance, Diana threw a muslin&#xD;
trifle at her maid, who, with shaking fingers,&#xD;
bound it about the martyr's arm.&#xD;
"It's'a pity," said Felix.&#xD;
." Wha's a pity ?" asked Esther.&#xD;
"To 'stain so dainty a handkerchief.' I will&#xD;
keep it as a souvenir of my wife."&#xD;
The nose of the silk mask went up a little&#xD;
higher.&#xD;
, " He who is content with a bit of muslin, is&#xD;
an obliging husband," added Felix.&#xD;
Esther closed the shutters cautiously, taking&#xD;
care not to expose her person to those outside.&#xD;
Diana walked toward her own room thought-&#xD;
fully.       .  -&#xD;
"Madam," continued Felix, determined to&#xD;
make thie most of the' opportunity, "I hope&#xD;
you have been fruitful' in expedients. Have&#xD;
you devised any means of getting me out of&#xD;
this house ?"&#xD;
"She has," interposed Esther, speaking for&#xD;
her mistress. "She has thought of two way.;&#xD;
and both is 'Wonderful.",&#xD;
" Well?"'&#xD;
'Nobody but Miss Diana would ever hai&#xD;

bit umion such a cur'ous plan. The chimney,'&#xD;
Sir, the chimney!"&#xD;
" What of the chimney?"&#xD;
" Up the chimney and down the leads."&#xD;
"Me!"cried Felix.&#xD;
"You, Sir. -'That's one way. There's an-&#xD;
other."&#xD;
"Up the chimney and down the leadsi' re-&#xD;
peated Felix.&#xD;
" And down the lightnin'-rods," added the&#xD;
girl.&#xD;
"I think I can see myself crawling up a&#xD;
chimney, and letting myself down-by the light.&#xD;
ning-rods 1" muttered  Felix, grandly.  "I&#xD;
wouldn't do it to get 'rid of the best woman&#xD;
that ever was."    I&#xD;
Diana's feet were arrested on the'threshold&#xD;
by this declaration.&#xD;
"I might be popped from the roof of the&#xD;
house like a squirrel!'" he continued. " It is&#xD;
one thing to plan and another to execute. I&#xD;
am-not a chimney-sweep, Miss Yellowskin." :.&#xD;
" Yellowskin !" echoed Esther, with unmea-&#xD;
sured contempt. "If you'd be a little more&#xD;
polite, Sir, you'd fare better. If it wasn't for&#xD;
my mistress' sake, I wouldn't tell you the other&#xD;
plan, which is safest of all; which" is down the&#xD;
chimney, into the cellar, and out through the&#xD;
:drain-"&#xD;
" Thank you !" retorted Felix, biting'his lips.&#xD;
" I am not a * ater-rat, nor an inspector of&#xD;
seers."&#xD;
"I must say, that, considering the circum-&#xD;
stanees,'yon're mighty particular," said Esther.&#xD;
"The drain is quite airy, Sir, and you might&#xD;
hide in it a week, without once being found.&#xD;
Nobody'd ever think of lookin' for you there."&#xD;
"I don't think they would !" said Felix, dryly.&#xD;
"If you 'had any regard for the lady's feelin's,&#xD;
Sir, you wouldn't be so nice," protested Esther,&#xD;
indignantly.'&#xD;
"I have some, regard for my own feelings,&#xD;
at any rate. If you like the drain project, you&#xD;
can try it."&#xD;
"Really, Sir, I begin to doubt your sincerity,"&#xD;
aaid Diana, breaking her long silence. "If you&#xD;
desired to leave me as much as you 'profess to,&#xD;
fou would be less fastidious about the rmeans."&#xD;
"Excuse me, my charming wife," answered&#xD;
Felix, sarcastically, "but I have some respect&#xD;
for appearances, as well as for practicabilities.&#xD;
You are certainly less offensive thin the drain,&#xD;
and less dangerous than the lightn ing-rods. I&#xD;
I-eally do not believe that you can make your-&#xD;
se' as disagreeable as a sewer."&#xD;
"You are very obliging, Sir!" returned&#xD;
Diana, stify. "I am flattered by your good&#xD;
opinion. But I must request you to drop the&#xD;
familiar appellation by which you lastaddressed&#xD;
me. Our present compact is one of necessity.&#xD;
'and will dissolve with your escape."&#xD;
" Lovely being," returned Felix, with gracefmml&#xD;
4rony, "do not talk of drains and chimneys to&#xD;
&#xD;
your husband, who, justice to myself compels,&#xD;
me to say, is a gentleman both by family, edu-&#xD;
cation, and instinct."&#xD;
." He might hide in the cistern," suggested'&#xD;
Esther, sotto voce.&#xD;
" Oh yesI Or in the oven ; or tinder the&#xD;
bed ! The resources of your maid, Madam, are&#xD;
remarkable.  You. perceive that night is ap-&#xD;
proaching, and, seriously, if-you can point out&#xD;
any reasonable method of exit, I am willing to&#xD;
incur a great risk ; although leaving you be-&#xD;
hind, I leave a part of myself!"&#xD;
"Do not pain me, Sir, by allusions to myself,"&#xD;
replied the lady, with earnesthess. "What you&#xD;
do not comprehend, be 'satisfied not to know.&#xD;
A thousand causes act upon the humaan heart&#xD;
and upon human conduct. We met in the man-&#xD;
ner known to you, and we shall part as abruptly'&#xD;
We met, we parted, is- all the history that will&#xD;
be written of us conjointly."&#xD;
"Not all," said Felix. ' Something more may&#xD;
be written. Life, Death, Marriage, are the three&#xD;
realities 'of this world."&#xD;
"I have it !" exclaimed Esther, with enthu-&#xD;
siasm. " Let him put on your' clothes, and go&#xD;
out boldly as"soon as it is dark."&#xD;
"Put on a doll's clothes !" laughed Felix,&#xD;
glancing at the small figure of Diana. Even&#xD;
the latter seemed amused by this suggestion.&#xD;
" Or he might fight his way out with a pistol""&#xD;
continued Esther, not in the: least discouraged&#xD;
by the unpopularity of her propositions.&#xD;
"Stop, girl!" said her mistress. "4You have&#xD;
no judgment. If you had suggested the trans-&#xD;
forming him into Old Sut, it Would have been&#xD;
mores sersible. Unless," she added, "the gen-&#xD;
tleman has such a'respect for appearances that&#xD;
he would object to a little burnt cork."&#xD;
" My good friends," answered Felix, cordially,&#xD;
"I will not object to a bushel of burnt corks, if&#xD;
the thing looks practicalland it be your pleasure."&#xD;
Westerly bowed in his most bland mannerr;&#xD;
which extraordinary concession she repaid by a&#xD;
slight courtesy. It seemed to him that she&#xD;
looked him over with more interest. She had&#xD;
him at considerable odds, however; .for while&#xD;
she could see-the changes of his expression, lie&#xD;
could not see through thie silken mask. But&#xD;
the eyes flashed upon hii now and then, like&#xD;
stars. To Felix, they were becoming myster-&#xD;
ious orbs, full of blended light and darkness.&#xD;
"He could easily be fixed up as Absalom&#xD;
Wills," said Esther, attacking the puzzling prob-&#xD;
lem again with unabated spirit.&#xD;
" I hope that there are but fed' points of re-&#xD;
semblance between us," rejoined Felix, dissatis-&#xD;
fled with the implication of the maid. " You&#xD;
may make a negro of me, but not a savage."&#xD;
" You'll get no more help from meI'll warn&#xD;
ye !" cried Esther, her patience exhausted.&#xD;
"And if l's Mistress Diana, I'd take you for a&#xD;
husband rather than waste any more time oi&#xD;

"Perhaps," answered Esther, with an obscure&#xD;

*mokeipes of the gunboats."&#xD;
Muttering that there wa "No faith in Yan-&#xD;
kees", Absalom went on with reluctant steps..&#xD;
It was now morning. A faint blush was creep-,&#xD;
ing up the eastern verge.  Their guide was si-&#xD;
lent, and walked with an uncertain air. -"Stop-&#xD;
ping anon on the crest of a swell, he pretended&#xD;
to look aroundsupon the country with great in-&#xD;
terest.&#xD;
" What's-the matte: ?" asked the Sandhiller.&#xD;
~ "Sorter turned round," answered Absalom,&#xD;
with an awkward affectation of being puzzled.'&#xD;
"The river oughter be out there, but durned if I&#xD;
ken see it."                         . .&#xD;
"It'll be lighter when old Blazer comes up,"&#xD;
said Barnaby, pointing to the east.  " If you&#xD;
don't see the chinbleys o' tliem Yankee cook-&#xD;
stoves about that yertime o' day, you'll be like-&#xD;
ly to see a cotton rope.  Cotton ropes is great&#xD;
things for weak eyes, . They're a good 'eal used,&#xD;
cotton ropes is, by your bi shwhackers and go-&#xD;
rillas.  The commidore is a gwine fur to try&#xD;
'em hisself. -"ev built a rope-walk down there&#xD;
by the big ditch fur to mannyfactei''em. 'Bout&#xD;
a quarter a mile long, the rope-walk is., Orders&#xD;
from the kentry executeliwith neatness and dis-&#xD;
patch.  Water-rats and bush-pirates hung at&#xD;
short notice, and at reasonable rates."&#xD;
The Saudhiller looked seriously at the ruddy&#xD;
patch lying low in the east. He drew down the&#xD;
corners of his mouth and eyes, and seemed to&#xD;
fall naturally into a refreshing current of phil-&#xD;
osophy, so suggestive were cotton ropes. Ab-&#xD;
salom, however, was not a party to this benign&#xD;
influence. The chief whipper in the house of&#xD;
Borrowscale made a wry face; and if looks had&#xD;
been hurtful, the young Sandhiller would have&#xD;
been hurt. There was a ropy skeleton .in Ab-&#xD;
salorm's cupboard. Skeletons will creep into&#xD;
cupboards. Every family has one. Nothing&#xD;
will put them down, go at them as you will, or&#xD;
with what you will. They will crouch in their&#xD;
dusty hiding places, and shake their crumbling&#xD;
fingers at you.-'&#xD;
Absalom's skeleton so worried him that 'he&#xD;
mechanically paused to stab the Sindhiller with&#xD;
his eyes, and to repeat the thrust again and&#xD;
again.&#xD;
" Go on," quoth Barnaby ; " as the annacon-&#xD;
der said to the rabbit, when he was a swallerin'&#xD;
of it. Don't be a fooling' by the way."&#xD;
' The humorous Sandhiller pricked Mr. Wills&#xD;
with his baypnet. Not maliciously ; but he&#xD;
pricked hin. Not wickedly; but he pricked&#xD;
him. Intention constitutes crime.; yet, in the&#xD;
Lace of this admitted fact, Absalom had the bad&#xD;
taste to drop some of the worst expletives ever&#xD;
heard, and to turn on his good-natured perse-&#xD;
cutor with hostile purpose. As nothing more&#xD;
could be done, he made a vow of retaliation, and&#xD;
shook the hand that sometimes shook the whip..&#xD;
&#xD;
He made an uncalled-for amount of friction, too'&#xD;
with his tobacco-stained teeth.&#xD;
" Be kerful o' yer molars," advised Barnaby.&#xD;
" Yee family would .hate. to hey yer lose 'eml&#xD;
Beautiful, them corner snags be. Wouldn't&#xD;
swap 'em with a Newfoundland, dog, would y6 ?"&#xD;
,Absalom muttered, and paid what he would&#xD;
do when he had Barnaby where he couldn'thelp&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
"Eyes like forks !" added the. Sandhill&#xD;
jester, nodding  and  winking  meditatively.&#xD;
Eyes like, forks with three .tines I Don't stab&#xD;
'em at me again, if yer please. Never stood'&#xD;
very strong on my legs, and I can't stand jab-.&#xD;
bin' to'no great extent."&#xD;
"W . e'll attend to your case one o' these yer'&#xD;
days, young man," murmured the overseer,&#xD;
writhing to avenge the indignities of tarnaby.&#xD;
"You're nat'rally -ohleegin'," responded the&#xD;
latter. "Put yer spokes in motion "&#xD;
As human locomotion represents adliving&#xD;
wheel, Barnaby's injunctionwas strictly in keep,&#xD;
ing with the laws of science.&#xD;
Absalom Wills' legs, and everybody else's&#xD;
legs, are spikes. They are reallyand truly&#xD;
spokes, and it might as well be spoken first as-&#xD;
last.&#xD;
"Roll on 1" added the youth, and the cold&#xD;
touch of. steel put the ,overseer's individual&#xD;
wheel in motion.&#xD;
They had not proceeded much further, when'&#xD;
Barnaby, becoming satisfied that they were go-&#xD;
ing in the wrong direction, suggested that their&#xD;
guide should be tied to a .cotton-wood, soundly&#xD;
lashed, and left to whatever fate chance, might&#xD;
bring.&#xD;
While they were debating this matter, a man&#xD;
on horseback emerged from the cover of some&#xD;
trees just before them. This meetingwas evi,&#xD;
deutly a surprise to both parties. The horse-&#xD;
man halted, not quite certain what to do. The&#xD;
Saundhiller presented his musket, and hailed him&#xD;
with&#xD;
' "Stop, stranger, or you'll hear a noise mighty&#xD;
suddint. Freeze down where ye be 1"&#xD;
This admonition had the effect to keep the&#xD;
horseman motionless where he had first drawn&#xD;
rein.&#xD;
There was nothing military in his;dress or&#xD;
appearance. -iHe was seemingly without arms,&#xD;
and plainly clad in a slate-colored suit of coarse&#xD;
and nondescript fabric. He wore on his head a&#xD;
jockey-cap, which was particularly adapted to&#xD;
riding among trees and obtrusive bushes. His&#xD;
horse was a tide animal, dark, small-limbed, and&#xD;
glossy. The rider sat easily, and rode well.&#xD;
These observations were quickly made by&#xD;
Felix. Absalom Wills made a hasty gesture.&#xD;
" No signals' "cried Barnaby, giving his une&#xD;
trusty guide assmart rap with his weapon.&#xD;
"That low cunnin' o' your'n '1 git ye into&#xD;
the next world 'fore. ye know it. Fust thing.&#xD;
you know you'll be dead."&#xD;

"I have heard," responded the rider, "that&#xD;

The man on the fine horsd niade this deelar.&#xD;

doubt of his intentions; ad Feli k thought it&#xD;
better to humor' his wishes than ta cnry en11&#xD;
his ,flyst purpose. So lie told hinm to go on and'&#xD;
be very careful not to attempt to get away, or&#xD;
to legd them into a trap. Barnaby did not&#xD;
favor this arrangement, but *as forced to sub-&#xD;
mit to the stronger will of his master.. Absa-&#xD;
lom begged' earnestly to be permitted to leave&#xD;
them, but the interested parties would by no&#xD;
means listen to his petition, and he was obliged&#xD;
to trudge on at the heels of the stranger's'horse.&#xD;
Young Westerly was now more than ever on;&#xD;
the alert, and kept the pistol, which Barnaby&#xD;
had given him, cocked and ready for instant&#xD;
nee.&#xD;
" I suppose," said the horseman, looking back&#xD;
over his shoulder, and taking the affair very&#xD;
coolly, "that after I have guided you to the!&#xD;
Federal lines, you will h.ot detain me ; but in {&#xD;
gratitude for the service, give me a little iced&#xD;
brandy, and send me back rejoicing. We suffer'&#xD;
dreadfully for ice down here. The horrors of&#xD;
war are unon us."&#xD;
" It's a pity about thet," observed Barnaby.&#xD;
" We'll hey a' few tons' set up to ye, if ye'll;&#xD;
leave yer kerd with one or t'other on us., It's a&#xD;
shame for a Christian crittur to go'thout his reg-&#xD;

Barnaby, quite as observant as his master&#xD;

that memorable garment-his dress 'was.a unit&#xD;

shifted, for himself:,he shifted for,,hiwtself.&#xD;

too, proved a 'benefaction to. Barnabv. He be-&#xD;
gan to dip snuff before .he had any teth tQdip&#xD;
it to. But that was an experiment that cost&#xD;
him areteling. At five, yeai's he could chew&#xD;
snuff and swear; swear distinctly and vith dis-&#xD;
cretion. His father, who had seen him  but a&#xD;
few times, began ,to notice hirm after that, and&#xD;
was able, after a few failures,.tiddistinguish him&#xD;
from the rest of his brood, :remarkable gifts&#xD;
do attract attention. When lie, had lived ten&#xD;
summers and nine winters, and yad' whipped&#xD;
his elderbrother in a rough-and tumble engage-&#xD;
ment, his thoughtful parent gave him a pair of&#xD;
red-breasted games, and he went regularly into&#xD;
the legitimate business of breeding'belligerents.&#xD;
It was true that the 'cockwas a retiied cripple,&#xD;
and the hen an ancient dame, but the progeny&#xD;
of this couple in due time' became .numerous&#xD;
and famous, and won many victories. Nearly&#xD;
all of Barnaby's dimes came of coal-fights.&#xD;
On several occasions he had, won considerable&#xD;
sums, which he scattered 'ith lavish hand. He&#xD;
was not niggardly. He would have made chari-&#xD;
table distributions among the poor, but he knew,&#xD;
of xo, persons that needed anything.  Members&#xD;
of his own family seemed to be doing; well'&#xD;
enough. according to his appreciation of life ;&#xD;
and wanted neither compassion nor benevo-&#xD;
lence. ,'le supposed 'that his naked brothers&#xD;
and sisters were treading the coinro thorough-&#xD;
fare of humanity, and that the gi'eatworld with-&#xD;
out had fallen into' the same track. Where&#xD;
there is nothing broken there', is thing }o&#xD;
mend, Barnaby ,didn'tfeel the necssity of&#xD;
mending even his manners.&#xD;
Four months previously, Barnaby had a sud-&#xD;
&#xD;
den disappearance. He was absent ,seven day.&#xD;
and two hours ; the last two hours encroaching&#xD;
on .the night. He returned in a Confederate&#xD;
suit. To' look at, he was Confederate frora&#xD;
liead to heel..' The.Sandhiller cast these gar-.&#xD;
meats. His Confederate slough was stowed&#xD;
away in some unknown place.     The young&#xD;
Sandhiljer vanished again. He was gone one&#xD;
month and' some oddl minutes; but no matter&#xD;
aboitt the minutes. We -ought to be very par-&#xD;
ticular alout time when speal4ug of important&#xD;
events, and this was an important event.to the&#xD;
-eipper's sen:lecame backto his'natal sands&#xD;
in Lincoln blue. Lincol hie is Federal blue,&#xD;
arid it's a good color. Buroaby's kith and kin&#xD;
were astonished one w hole da, by the spectacle&#xD;
of their relative in martial array,'and in the&#xD;
National colors.- l'e7,had a bayonet and a pis.&#xD;
tol. The bayonet .was an old-fashioned one,&#xD;
4nd hung in along,'slim sheath, at-his left side,&#xD;
or rather at tihe left aide of his back. The pie-&#xD;
tol was a terrible thing, and'one of the wondera&#xD;
of the ,world to All the Sandhillers whog'.bheld&#xD;
it. It "eould actually be fired six times with.&#xD;
'loading put once; that is, it wpuld shoot that&#xD;
nuniber of tides-when it went off. Barnaby.&#xD;
offered to shoot it tin biggin froi his youngest&#xD;
brother's' head, at'the' distance-of'thirty paces&#xD;
-but his'brother wouldn't stand.&#xD;
"One' fact' was,' apparent : the clipper's son,&#xD;
and the dipper's son had enlisted in the Con-&#xD;
federate service. That was one fact, and the&#xD;
first; but it was not so startling in its eharac.&#xD;
ter as fact number two, which was that this pre..&#xD;
cocious offspring had also enlisted in the Na.&#xD;
tional Army! He had, crossed thirty miles of&#xD;
Yazoo swamp, and cast 'his lot with the Fed-&#xD;
erals under Grant. He stood before them a de-&#xD;
serter of an aggravated type. He received&#xD;
some abuse.  his mother was ashamed of his&#xD;
degeneracy, arid ordered him out of the parental&#xD;
hut ; but his father, of a more practical turn,&#xD;
eyed his good clothes in 'an abstracted manner,&#xD;
and there, is no doubt but he would have ab-&#xD;
stracted the clothes likewise, if he had had an&#xD;
opportunity. Nevertheless; Mr. Cruise was a&#xD;
champion of the.Southern Cross, and a noisy&#xD;
cockpit politician. Yet he admitted to Mrs.&#xD;
Cruise, privately, that it was not a bad thing to&#xD;
represent both sides of the question in his fam-&#xD;
ily, as he intended 'that his other boys should"&#xD;
fight under the banners of King Cotton. Bar--&#xD;
naby remained at - home twenty-four hours,.&#xD;
which was long enough for his safety. Finding:&#xD;
the neighborhood getting rather hot with Se-&#xD;
cession zeal, he said :&#xD;
"lHe 2;ekoned he'd make tracks fur them yer&#xD;
big ditches."&#xD;
T'he truth was, that after enrollment in the&#xD;
Federal Army, he had been taken into the serv-&#xD;
ice of Felix Westerly, to whom in a short time&#xD;
he became verynuch attached  'This was the&#xD;

lence we- have- improved in doing some jtisice&#xD;
to a character essential to -the interest ' of our&#xD;
story, and who has too long been in the back-&#xD;

address his -'attendant, -a husky murmur only&#xD;
escaped his lips.&#xD;
Barnaby, lieaing-; a dry hissing, 'peited a tin&#xD;
}cup'and a l aige' iron spoon, aied went at him&#xD;
-with some-kind offluid, which he spooned into&#xD;
his master's mouth with such rapidity -and seal,&#xD;
that he came near strangling him. Felix was&#xD;
forced to seize -the mischievous implement with&#xD;
both-hands, to -stay the tide - of -moisture that&#xD;
threatened to-stop his breath ; as the one need-&#xD;
ed to becoming out- while the other was going&#xD;

- like a'man in the throes of hydrophobia. Bar-&#xD;

unelinch his fingers, and recover possession 'of&#xD;
-the instrument of medication, but his patient,&#xD;
- exerted mqre'strength 'than'he had expected.&#xD;
" Let go!l" said Barnaby, gently. " Lets-go,&#xD;
please I as-Torlah -said to the whale."&#xD;
Felix swallowed a 'mouthful of detestable&#xD;
.-mixture, caught his breath -with a 'gasp,- and&#xD;
threw the'spoon across the room.&#xD;
"-None o' that" remonstrated Bardaby.&#xD;
"You've throwed things 'enough for the -last&#xD;

At this climax the Sandhiller paused. He  "And the lady ?" asked Felix.&#xD;

"Needn't be a lookin' for'em," said Barnaby. he softly touched the sleeper's wrist, to see&#xD;
"Six or eight on 'em  closed up yesterday. what story the heart was telling. The Sand-&#xD;

&#xD;
CH APTER X.&#xD;
THE NURSE.&#xD;
Turned the door noiselessly on its hinges,&#xD;
end entered a lady. The lady was young; the&#xD;
lady was fair. We cannot describe her to order.&#xD;
Beautiful women cannot be displayed on liter-&#xD;
ary counters item by item. There are lovable&#xD;
things that have no name. A cast of the eye&#xD;
or a turn of the head may steal one's heart.&#xD;
This young woman had: one head of brown&#xD;
hair, one white forehead, two arched and pen-&#xD;
ciled brows, two bright and dangerous eyes, one&#xD;
straight and comely nose, one pet mouth, two&#xD;
carmine cheeks, and a dainty chin. - To these&#xD;
treasures add a pair of round white arms, kiss-&#xD;
able hands, and a charming figure.&#xD;
As she gathered up the skirts of her dress&#xD;
and softly approached Barnaby, a marvelously&#xD;
small foot crept out.&#xD;
Barnaby arose with as much confusion as he&#xD;
was capable of manifesting. Beauty was apt to&#xD;
flurry the young Sandhiller; it was something&#xD;
lie was not used to. He supposed that if there&#xD;
were any angels they looked like this lovely&#xD;
creature, who had suddenly appeared to nurse&#xD;
and care for Felix. He beheld her daily with&#xD;
growing reverence. She was superior to any&#xD;
being his simple eyes had seen. During the,&#xD;
delirium of Felix he *ondered that her touch&#xD;
had not wrought a mien ele, and restored him to&#xD;
instant coherency. Ie scarcely knew whether&#xD;
she dropped from the clouds or was the proper&#xD;
divinity of the house. The colored servants&#xD;
called her Miss Anna ; and that was all he knew&#xD;
of her. During her visit to the sick man, lie&#xD;
had done little more than to stare at her in a&#xD;
mute and deferential way. It was some time be-&#xD;
fore he ventured to talk in her presence; but by-&#xD;
and-by, finding her gracious and affable, lie be-&#xD;
gan to display his, peculiar qualities. In mov-&#xD;
ing, it chanced that Barnaby overthrew a chair&#xD;
and made a clattering that awakened Felix.&#xD;
The Sandhiller was prone to upset things when&#xD;
Miss Anna was about. He had dropped glasses&#xD;
and cups in taking them from her hand; for lie&#xD;
never troubled himself to look at what he was&#xD;
receiving, but at the person who was giving.&#xD;
More than once this flattering attention had&#xD;
'brought blushes to her cheeks and smiles to&#xD;
her lips.&#xD;
But to return to the accident of the chair;&#xD;
it caused Felix to lift his slumberous lids a&#xD;
little, just enough to see the advancing figure.&#xD;
For a moment he experienced a flash of un-&#xD;
certainty and doubt-a wave from the recent&#xD;
terror and darkness. But this was of short con-&#xD;
tinuance. le mentally poised himself shut out&#xD;
the vision an instant, and then returned to it&#xD;
with more consistency of deliberation. He had&#xD;
sense enough to be hypocritical. A man can&#xD;
be hypocritical when he is very weak. Indeed&#xD;
hypocrisy can be practiced to the very last.&#xD;
Ale kept his eyes more than half closed, but&#xD;
&#xD;
the ungrateful one saw his benefactress from'&#xD;
her brows to the tip of her slippers. He saw&#xD;
too much. He had professed to scorn the at-&#xD;
tractious of the sex, and his heart had never&#xD;
been touched by the glamour of woman. Young&#xD;
men, like the leaves, have their time to fal,&#xD;
and love,,like death, has all seasons for its&#xD;
own. Felix was likely to fall, if lie looked-&#xD;
and he looked. Millers will fly into the candle.&#xD;
He was flying into the candle, but did not&#xD;
know it.&#xD;
She stood by the bedside ; she bent over him;&#xD;
she touched his forehead with, the tips of her&#xD;
fingers. That made a sensation, but not much.&#xD;
He could not see her now-the valves of his&#xD;
eyes shut her out. Hypocrisy is very prudent,&#xD;
and. sometimes baffles itself., He muttered,&#xD;
moved his, head, and opened his eyes in a wan.&#xD;
dering way. They met those above him and&#xD;
over him, and his pale face flushed. There was&#xD;
a new and- strange flut'ering within him. He&#xD;
attributed it to weakness--weakness of the heart,&#xD;
which, sinceEve, has had a trick of being sur-&#xD;
prised. Felix made a groan, which was half&#xD;
sigh and half murmurs, and all deceitful. The&#xD;
fair nurse passed her palm to his brow and&#xD;
said :&#xD;
" Poor fellow I"&#xD;
Felix never heard such a "poor- fellow!" in&#xD;
his life. Ile would like to have been poor fel-&#xD;
lowed all lay. He accounted for this effect by&#xD;
his' mother; because he had a mother, and she&#xD;
brought back the idea of his mother. Dissatis-&#xD;
fied with this, presently, he used his sister in&#xD;
the same way; and between them both was sure&#xD;
the riddle was read.&#xD;
"lHe wanders yet, don't lie Barnaby ?"  She&#xD;
was speaking again, and Felix expected to be&#xD;
unmasked.&#xD;
"lHe hasn't left the room," said Barnaby.&#xD;
I mean wandering in his mind," explained&#xD;
the pretty nurse.&#xD;
" Mentually, Miss, he's straight as a string,"&#xD;
affirmed Barnaby.&#xD;
"Is lie rational ?"&#xD;
" He's had no rashuns, Miss, but he's spoke,&#xD;
and opened his eyes as bright as ever."&#xD;
The white-fingered nurse stepped back from&#xD;
the bed a little, and looked suspiciously at her&#xD;
patient."&#xD;
"lIe's asleep, or playing' 'possum, Miss; I&#xD;
dunno which," responded Barnaby.&#xD;
"Oh l" exclaimed the lady, coloring.&#xD;
" Ie's terrible tricky, Mem," added the in-&#xD;
genuous Barnaby.&#xD;
Felix felt his face tingling, and wished the&#xD;
Sandhiller buried in his native sandhill.&#xD;
" The monsterI" murmured Miss Anna, with&#xD;
something between a smile and a frown. "He&#xD;
grows worse as soon as he grows better. Are&#xD;
you sure, Barnaby, that he. really knew any.&#xD;
thing ?'&#xD;
" Bet my life on it, Miss!" said Barnabys&#xD;

which disappear o' a suddint, and ye ken't tell&#xD;

" Pears like'that way to me," put in Barnaby,&#xD;
with 'asignificant grin.&#xD;
You compounded some of that wonderful&#xD;
salve made forever famous by the Knight of&#xD;
La Mtaneha I' continued. Felix, utterly ignoring&#xD;
the Sndhiller.&#xD;
And then the beauty of Anna made him sigh.&#xD;
&amp;amp;Anna was, in some manner, getting mixed up&#xD;
with his wounds. There was a strange jumble&#xD;
of Anna in his mind; Anna and hunger-more&#xD;
Anna than. hunger. Ile was, weak, anl Anna&#xD;
had home upon him like a Brunswick tide. He&#xD;
was neither prepared for flight nor resistance.&#xD;
So he was overwhelmed --with Ania. His head,&#xD;
swam, but he sank-in the sea of Anna.&#xD;
So Felix was lost, and went drifting to and&#xD;
fro, catching at idle straws of fancy.&#xD;
While lie was yielding to a new set of sensa-,&#xD;
tions, she was employed in a common-place yet&#xD;
sensible manner; she was putting the touch of&#xD;
woman's hand on masculine untidiness. When-&#xD;
ever he ventured to loon, he saw order growing&#xD;
out of confusion. By and by, she wet his face&#xD;
and hands with perfumed water, and a marvel-&#xD;
ous influence soothed him. Illness was no ca-&#xD;
lamity, and captivity no pain.&#xD;
Barnaby inffrms me," he said, when he had&#xD;
fdund courage to break the calmness that was&#xD;
upon him "that I have been savagely uncon-&#xD;
scious for several days. I ought to apologize&#xD;
fdr being a vexatious guest."&#xD;
"Four days of delirium and danger.  But&#xD;
the powers of life have triumphed. With pru-&#xD;
dence and rest, you will recover. Talking much&#xD;

She ranga bell, which brought a browa maid,&#xD;

that Felix threatened - to throw things tat hits,&#xD;
and was greatly seandahised., In the dead stl-,&#xD;

"Anything stirring transpired lately ?"aFei,&#xD;
inquired, presently,' hoping to hear of a Fdcit&#xD;

His fair .nurse, who had been standing wits;-&#xD;
her back to him, since the accident-of the broth,,&#xD;
answered :&#xD;
"Tlire has been some skirmishing on the,&#xD;
Yazoo, and heavy seizures of cotton, but noth.&#xD;
iug decisive. It is thought the cemy will&#xD;
abandon the river, and attempt to reach Viecs-&#xD;
burg by some other way."&#xD;
She did not trust herself to look at her pp-&#xD;
tient. She had starch on the brain.&#xD;
The word "-enemy" gave Felix an unpleasant&#xD;
sensation. It reminded him that his fair nue -&#xD;
and himself stood on opposite sides of a vexes&#xD;
question.&#xD;
"Let me' hope," he said, seriously, "'tbat.&#xD;

"I forbid polities." answered Anna, authogs-&#xD;
tatively. "You are it prisoner of war, and I&#xD;
am your jailor."&#xD;
She tried to look like a good Confederate.&#xD;
"I do not complain," said Felix.&#xD;
" You are here," she resumed, still keeping&#xD;
her face from him,-"without watch or ward.&#xD;
Your captors were going to leave, soldiers ; but&#xD;
I became responsible for your safe keeping,&#xD;
which was no. great thing, as your wounds were&#xD;

&#xD;
that you wilt not take, advantage of convales-&#xD;
cence to fly the castle."&#xD;
'";ou are goodness.itaeifi" exclaimed Felix,&#xD;
with enthua.iasm. "Your simple wish will keep&#xD;
me here more effectually than an army of men.&#xD;
Your commands are stronger than guards with&#xD;
icdbayonets."&#xD;
Ho had never addressed a woman with so&#xD;
much warmth.&#xD;
" We're on our peril o' honor !" quoth Bar-&#xD;
naby, and then went into a corner to choke&#xD;
down a great deal of loose laugh that was in&#xD;
bun-.&#xD;
"It  as been said," observed -Anna, "that&#xD;
" wNorthmea sometimes violate your parole."&#xD;
"I swear to you, Madam, that 'tisfalse !" cried&#xD;
Felix, wrathful at the imputation, and starting&#xD;
up in bed.&#xD;
A white hand came over his lips, and he was&#xD;
gently pushed back upon his pillow. What&#xD;
poWer there was in'those small fingers I They&#xD;
eould have dragged Felix anywhere and bound&#xD;
him fast with a thread. She menaced him with&#xD;
an onmipotent gesture, and bade him rest.&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
5P.'CUL,&amp;amp;TIOr, .E&#xD;
Left alone with Barnaby, Felix began to think&#xD;
him exceedingly (lull and stupid. The comical&#xD;
charms of his society was gone. When the lady&#xD;
Balled Anna left the room, the Saudhiller be-&#xD;
espoe but a grain of sand in'the young man's es-i&#xD;
timation. He retended to go to sleep,' but le&#xD;
shut his eyes to shut out Barnaby and shut&#xD;
in his thoughts. He had enough to think of. 1&#xD;
The magnetism of his muse pervaded him thor-&#xD;
eughly.1&#xD;
Baruaby creaked about the room on tiptoe, k&#xD;
casting curious looks at his friend, occasionally&#xD;
turning his back and clapping his hand upon hisa&#xD;
mouth to smother contiiually returning attacks&#xD;
of laughter. Felix, being wide awake, soon be- I&#xD;
camp conscious of this state of things.t&#xD;
"Barnaby, ihe said, sharply, "if you can't&#xD;
keep quiet, leaves me. It seems to me that 'I&#xD;
you are losing your senses."               V&#xD;
" That's what I t hough of, myself," answered&#xD;
Barnaby, with good nature. "Didn't use to be&#xD;
so. It's sonethin' that's attackled me lately. w&#xD;
Ye see I can't help it, Sir. Fust thing I know, o&#xD;
my cheeks begin to puff and my mouth to s&#xD;
pucker."                                  e&#xD;
The Sandhiller gave an illustration of the b&#xD;
pufaing and puckering.&#xD;
"   don't see any sense in it," observed Fe- &#xD;
ix.&#xD;
"N~*r I, nther," assented the Sandhiller,&#xD;
ready to explode again. "Nobody ken see the&#xD;
sense on't. Why? Caus there eu.'t nery sense&#xD;
in'. Wouldn't ye like jest a leetle broth, Sir i&#xD;
It's proper good for the stomich, as the old leddy &#xD;
said about the rum and metheglin"   n&#xD;
Felix said something te the disaagmnto&#xD;
&#xD;
-the old lady, and avowed his determination te&#xD;
have Barnaby put, into a strait-jacket, if on*&#xD;
could be found in the Confederacy.&#xD;
"Thank ye 1" said Barnaby, with c .ereiga&#xD;
good.humor. " shud like to be wut into one o'&#xD;
those yer strait garments, as the one I got on is&#xD;
gittin' mighty crooked in the seams. How did&#xD;
ye like the shedoctor "&#xD;
You'll oblige me, Barnaby, by speaking re-&#xD;
spectfully of that young lady !" replied Felix,in ;&#xD;
bad temp~er. 11She-doctor is not elegant." Ih&#xD;
* I think she be!" said the Sandhiller.&#xD;
" Wouldn't have no other doctor round me if&#xD;
I'se sick. She moved about 'thout teaching the&#xD;
floor, apparently. And then the figger!I Give&#xD;
me a figger, Sir. If other's anything' I'm fond of&#xD;
it's a figger-! Jest put a bigger into-my room,&#xD;
Sir, and I could be sick forever."&#xD;
"She was not very large," observed Felix,&#xD;
entrapped into more amiability by Barnaby's&#xD;
"figger" .&#xD;
rNot very large, Sir; but what there was of&#xD;
her was 0. K. i  Did ye notice how hendy she&#xD;
was with things? Did ye happen to see her'&#xD;
mouth, Sir? Other's everything' in a mouth.&#xD;
I'd rether hey her mouth than- the whole o'&#xD;
some wiinming   Wish you'd jest throw a curt-&#xD;
ing over my race to keep thet mouth out o' my&#xD;
uyes, when she comes in again. I hate to her&#xD;
a mouth like thet in my eyes."&#xD;
"Don't be concerned; irwill never get very&#xD;
near your eyes," said Felix,&#xD;
"e1cr nose was waxworks, I'll swar!" continu-&#xD;
ed the Sandhiller, who was now fairly launched&#xD;
upon his theme. "'Twas so delikit that 'twan&#xD;
transperient, when she stood atwixt me and the&#xD;
ight And wasn'tt set onto one side nether,&#xD;
biut p~lumb in orange atweeni the forehead and&#xD;
chin. A hair draped from one to t'other would&#xD;
trike thet orgin through die centre. '1'wasn't&#xD;
made for use, tl~at nose wasn't, but fur ornimint.&#xD;
'a a regular Sunday-go-1o-meetir' nose, and fit&#xD;
o smell nothit' but extracts o' roses. But&#xD;
tisu't a nose as turns up easy; if it bed been,&#xD;
would turned up when she wer' here, for you&#xD;
was mighty feverish, Sir."&#xD;
" What's her name, Barnaby ?"&#xD;
The servants call her Miss Annie. Dunno'&#xD;
whether thet's only the beginnin', or the whole&#xD;
un't. Perohably tier's more o' the same sort&#xD;
um'ers. Ye ken look it upwhen aye git well&#xD;
enough to toddle about. Tiiet was nourishin'&#xD;
broth, SirI"&#xD;
To prove that he was entirely done with&#xD;
laughter, Barnaby looked ludicrously solemn.&#xD;
" It was tuick," said Felix; " but palatabl."&#xD;
"It'll stick by the ribs, I allow."&#xD;
The Sandhiller pulled the corners of his&#xD;
aoutb hard toward his nether j w, and rolled&#xD;
is eyes in their sockets as if they had been&#xD;
marbles   e&#xD;
Felix Westerly saw that face, and its queer&#xD;
xpression fixed his gase, and exei'ed distrust.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You villainI" he cried. "What have you&#xD;
get? Out with it, and not stand munching it&#xD;
in that way !"&#xD;
"Don't miud me, Sir, but the leddy. This&#xD;
yen thet ails me is'the chills and fever. I never&#xD;
h-d the Looping-cough either. Nor the measels.&#xD;
I shouldn't wonder if they all attackled me to&#xD;
onet. I feel queer about the pericodium 1"&#xD;
The Sandhiller placed a large red hand over&#xD;
the region of his heart.&#xD;
"You go to the devil !" muttered Felix.&#xD;
"I'm too sick to hear any of your saws. You'll&#xD;
lose a month's pay, boy, before you are many&#xD;
days older."&#xD;
"You see afore ye," answered Barnaby, in a&#xD;
subdued voice, " almost a orphing ! My mother&#xD;
was a dipper, and my father was a clipper. I&#xD;
never passed through college; but I've reared&#xD;
a good nany game chiekings. You mustn't be&#xD;
hard on a covey when he suddenly took con-&#xD;
'vels'nt. The best of us is exposed to sickness ;&#xD;
but I know the antidote, as the spider said&#xD;
when he went after the plantain leaf. I'll run&#xD;
right to the cook while the sinhktoms are coming&#xD;
on. A biggin o' potato starch '11 put me all&#xD;
right, Sir. I'll learn the leddy's name to the&#xD;
same time, which '1l be doin' two thinks to onet."&#xD;
The Sandhiller rushed out. Felix tried to&#xD;
make sense out of what he had said, but his&#xD;
mind was muddled and -weak, and he could get'&#xD;
nothing intelligible out of it. He passed into&#xD;
a deep sleep, thinking of Anna. And Felix&#xD;
never went to sleep again without thinking of&#xD;
Anna.&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
FELIx AND BARNABY.&#xD;
As Felix grew better physically, he grew&#xD;
Worse mentally. The mental malady soon be-&#xD;
came incurable. It seized the most vital part&#xD;
of him, and maintained its grasp tenaciously.&#xD;
Felix fought the disease ; at first, from prince.&#xD;
ple; but it was a feeble fight, and by and by he&#xD;
laid down his weapons. He grounded arms at&#xD;
the feet of Anna. Her daily visits were the&#xD;
only happy moments of his life. All other&#xD;
seasons were seasons of loneliness and expect-&#xD;
ancy.  The nocturnal marriage ' at Borrow-&#xD;
scale's now troubled him. It was a trouble&#xD;
that steadily increased ; a ghost of memory,&#xD;
that pursued him night and day. He had&#xD;
qualms and scruples and spasms of honor ;&#xD;
but fate hurried him en--after Anna.&#xD;
Of the history of this maiden he knew abso-&#xD;
lutely nothing. Her name he had learned;&#xD;
that trifling knowledge being, one of the inevi-&#xD;
table necessities of the situation. To know that&#xD;
he had a beautiful nurse, and that her name was&#xD;
Anna Conway, was certainly not much.&#xD;
The moment he was able to sit up, he sat&#xD;
down and- began a new business. This business&#xD;
was love-making-an employment which Na-&#xD;
ture teaches, but which Artelps. Love-making&#xD;
&#xD;
is the spring work of life. Everybody goes&#xD;
into it in the verdure and foliage of youth. In&#xD;
the flower and- beauty of that sunny time hope&#xD;
gives enthusiasm and warm blood hurries on&#xD;
the catastrophe.&#xD;
Anna was not proud ; but she ad a singular&#xD;
faculty of keeping Felix at a distance. III seem-&#xD;
ed to him that this was intentional, and was to&#xD;
be persisted in by her. He could bear anything&#xD;
better than indifferened, and Anna was indit-&#xD;
ferent. At least, such was the construction that&#xD;
he put upon her conduct. It was in vain that&#xD;
le made sundry attempts to conceal the sudden&#xD;
interest which she had inspired ; the truth&#xD;
would out at unexpected moments.. One can-&#xD;
not guard every action and look. He betrayed&#xD;
himself a dozen times a day. Meantime, his&#xD;
wounds healed rapidly, and when they ceased&#xD;
to .give him  much trouble, he pretended to&#xD;
suffer from a ,buckerhot in his leg; a buckshot&#xD;
that he could never bring.Barnaby to believe&#xD;
in. But Felix said that it had flattened against&#xD;
the. bone, and produced inflammation of the&#xD;
per. 'steum, which was always a painful and&#xD;
vexatious thing. So he went limping about his&#xD;
room, after he was entitled to a discharge from&#xD;
the hospital. Deceit was one of his horrible&#xD;
sins of commission. Barnaby asked him, one&#xD;
day, how long he thought he should be confined&#xD;
to the house ?-which query he answered in&#xD;
the vaguest manner at first, but finally decided&#xD;
that a month ought to suffice for restoration to&#xD;
a tolerable state of health. Barnaby whistled;&#xD;
Felix drummed on the table in an absent-&#xD;
minded manner, He was gettting to be shy of&#xD;
the Sandhiller.&#xD;
" I haven't any- apetite !" said Felix, de.&#xD;
spondingly.&#xD;
"pI hedn t observed thet 1" answered Barnaby.&#xD;
" She's ramsacked the Confed'racy for poultry,&#xD;
I should jedge. Ther's been a contineral flap-&#xD;
pin' and squawkin' in the back yard, fur nigh&#xD;
on t' a fortnight. The young darkeys is just&#xD;
about fagged out with slaughter. They sleep&#xD;
on the battle-field with the'r cleavers aside&#xD;
'em."&#xD;
Felix made no response.&#xD;
" It's time to be running' away again," added&#xD;
Barnaby. "I 'listed to fight, and I want to&#xD;
airat my wages."&#xD;
" We can't run away, Barnaby. My word is&#xD;
pledged to the lady. We're on our parole."&#xD;
" You may be on your'n, but durned if I'm&#xD;
on mine.  Shouldn't know a- peril o' honor&#xD;
from a receipt-book. and I don't keer no more&#xD;
for 't. No gammon, Felix. I won't stan' no&#xD;
gammon. You ken swaller potato-starch, but&#xD;
rot me if I'll swaller that buckshot in the leg,&#xD;
or yer peril o' honor. I know what's happened&#xD;
to ye ! It's Miss Anna I That's the buoshot&#xD;
that's winged ye 1"&#xD;
" Runaway if you want to," said Felix, dog.&#xD;
godly. " Nothing hinders you from running,&#xD;

Barnaby-blew up.hischeeks, and worried Felit&#xD;
with his elbows, in ,a rapid series of signals.&#xD;

"'It wer' a woman, Mew, thetfell inlove with'&#xD;

" I'm gwine to leave ye'together," whispered.&#xD;
Barnaby.   "Attackles her.  Go at her -right&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER ,XIIY.&#xD;
ANNA.&#xD;
Felix lqolked at the face of Anna ; it wasatranp&#xD;
quil. She had become mistress of ,herself while.&#xD;
bp was yet -gIowing with ;embarrassed surprise.&#xD;
His wavering eyes, as they drooped, ran. over&#xD;
wavr fire.  She never . seemed so shapely be-&#xD;
forne.  A'd there was something mpre than,&#xD;
slapeiness; there were the curved and grace-&#xD;
fu lines.of .beauty.  lie could not turnaway&#xD;
from. her. Feelingithat he was conducting:him-&#xD;
self awkwardly, he said :&#xD;
"lBe seated, Miss Conway."&#xD;
Tiiawas a simple sentence, and he said it lite&#xD;
* simpleton. She sank into an;easy.cbair with.&#xD;
-avm~ng carelessness. Shewas calm as. sum-&#xD;
mer, and self-conscious.  He wishedher more&#xD;
emotion 1, and himself lesaso. The enemy was&#xD;
before him. Ile sat under the perilous battery,&#xD;
ofAnna.-a battery of conquering; eyes,  How&#xD;
dkopld he commence the assault ?. He sentout.&#xD;
r connoitering glances, but they returned, bat&#xD;
,e;, frpm. their inqisitive venture.&#xD;
"Whom, were .youslandering, Sir, when I&#xD;
capieiin ?" asked Anna, frigidly.&#xD;
"A shrew," answered Felix, unfortunatelyyas&#xD;
it seemed ; for Mia Conway grew' more-lofty in&#xD;
hermanner.&#xD;
"So you have founds shrew among us2" she,&#xD;
observed.&#xD;
"Tie only one in, the country, I dare says"&#xD;
saide elix,, olitely.;&#xD;
"Oh, I thank you ! I thought it possible;tbat.&#xD;
you. had found another."&#xD;
"Miss Conway," returned Felix with earnest-&#xD;
nees,."you are certainly jesting."'&#xD;
Here was an. opportunity for enthusiasm;&#xD;
.gi ;was going to improve it to the utmost,&#xD;
when Anna.remarked :&#xD;
"Describe mue that shrew."&#xD;
Sheaccompanied this command by a-glance&#xD;
that was im perative.&#xD;
"Impossible 1" murmured Felix.&#xD;
"iV ly impossible? Could you -not describe&#xD;
me, if reqested to do so by a lady ? By your&#xD;
next nurse, for instance ; for I.take it for grant-&#xD;
ed; that ) ou'll go on being wounded and nursed."&#xD;
" Describe  you " exclaimed  Felix, with&#xD;
warmthi. "I do not know; .I think not- I really&#xD;
thiukimot.  Beauty is indescribable.  Beauty&#xD;
is inspiration. The nose, the eyes, the mouth,&#xD;
do not altogether make it. The expresion, the&#xD;
glow, the fervor of the thought-"&#xD;
'"You are getting feverish again," interrupted&#xD;
Anna. " We must look out .for your deirlium.&#xD;
Thq surgeon said it was-an intermittent kind."&#xD;
For an instant the young man's breath seemed&#xD;
gone.. Then, t show that he was not hurt, he&#xD;
laughed ; hpt it was that kind of a laugh which&#xD;
heroes sometimes, make to shpw. their courage.&#xD;
widle having a lirab amputated. His niren did&#xD;
not smile. There was the appearance of mode'&#xD;
rate fear in her expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Fair nurse," said Felix; anon, " you havV&#xD;
c9me to nie full, of cruelty, Your visits used,&#xD;
to be visits'of mercy ; butto-day youthave-sow&#xD;
to pyt me down."&#xD;
"I heard yo~i ppeak ill of myssex," said Misa-&#xD;
Conway.&#xD;
"Not of your sex, but-of oneof your sex.. Let]&#xD;
us start fairly. I .heg pardon. for all sins of :&#xD;
omission and commission, past, present, and "t%&#xD;
como,"&#xD;
"That cannot be forgiven which.has:not -hap..&#xD;
pened. There is no name forthat which. never&#xD;
has been;, Come away frons the future., Let,.i4,&#xD;
be. You are up for punishment. £Look in my,&#xD;
face; and apewer.me."&#xD;
" Will look in your face," stammered Wes&#xD;
terly, " as much as. you please, but ,I do koWr&#xD;
know that I will, answer you.  I, complainaok&#xD;
you spnewhct, You listened,,aud-you are push.,&#xD;

"qQestions should tbe ,i r the mQuth," said&#xD;
Anna.&#xD;
"Fair, nurse,, you get i rmyway.  Stand&#xD;
aside. Hear me while. 1 answer the inquiry of&#xD;
your motionless lips. This shrew isa planter's&#xD;
daughter. . No, matter what .:planter; no mattr&#xD;
where he lives. Well," said .Felix, hesitating,&#xD;
"that is, about all there is of the story."&#xD;
"Except-the squint,eyes,:serew- mouth, star-&#xD;

"No.; you ought to obey.   I'll have noire-!&#xD;

" Excuse me, Miss Conway,; but--I really;&#xD;
won't. You don't know the situation.  There&#xD;
were circumstances-which--whieh .were not of,&#xD;
the slightest earthlyimportance."&#xD;
He looked at . Anna's sipper in ludicrous em!&#xD;
barrassnent. She drew the slipper out of sight..&#xD;
"This confessional will soon- close," added&#xD;
Anna,.bodiugly.&#xD;
"I entreat otherwise," cried Felix, lighting&#xD;
up suddenly.  " I beg that you will remain toy&#xD;

grace. Morally, she pushed him back, and.held&#xD;
him under the touch of her finger.&#xD;
"You'll make me insane, by heavens !" he&#xD;
mutteredd, beginning to be vexed.&#xD;
"I am your nurse, am I not2" continued&#xD;
Anna, holding him firmly in hand.&#xD;
Felix nodded sullenly.&#xD;
" You trusted me with the physical malady ?"&#xD;
Another bow, more ungracious than the&#xD;
other.&#xD;
" I treated it skillfully, I believe you are&#xD;
ready to acknowledge ?"&#xD;
Felix stole a sidelong glance at his dictatress ;&#xD;
her prestige was growing greater, and his was&#xD;
growing less.&#xD;
" Your mental state was worse than the other.&#xD;
It was that whieb gave us uneasiness. No man&#xD;
is judge of his own sanity. I have been the&#xD;
witness and attendant of both conditions, and it&#xD;
is for me'to pronounce on your mental sound-&#xD;
ness. Rebel, if you dare I"&#xD;
Playfulness and authority were charmingly&#xD;
mingled in her manner.&#xD;
"I'll run away !" threatened Felix, more put&#xD;
down than he ever thought he could be.&#xD;
" You .cannot. You forget that I am your&#xD;
sailor as well as your nurse. I have your word&#xD;
of honor to remain during my pleasure. Be-&#xD;
ing, as you profess to be, a gentleman, nothing&#xD;
is more impossible than for you to run away.I&#xD;
It would be dishonorable to break faith with aI&#xD;
man; but it would be infamous to break faith&#xD;
with a woman, who has not the physical ability&#xD;
-to enforce the compact "1&#xD;
Westerly became silent -and attentive. The'&#xD;
,extraordinary mental composition of this Anna&#xD;
began to be revealed to him. He thought itf&#xD;
was time to stop and to try a new start.'- 1&#xD;
" Your last remarks, Madam," he said, by-e&#xD;
and-by, with much courtliness, "are undeniably&#xD;
true. I will tell you another truth : I am twice&#xD;
a prisoner; once to the Confederate Govern- I&#xD;
meant, once to you. Should I escape from the 1&#xD;
Confederates, I cannot escape from you. Butt&#xD;
I see how it is to be. This conversation hasa&#xD;
taught me to expect nothing. You have a&#xD;
marvelous power of walking over one's wishes, s&#xD;
and of tampering with. his hopes.  Mock on,&#xD;
for you mock so charmingly, that the pain anda&#xD;
the pleasure are about equally balanced. As&#xD;
you have control of me, without and within, it&#xD;
only remains for me to render passive obedience, n&#xD;
which is not exactly according to my education&#xD;
and natural impulses." He stopped, then add-&#xD;
ed, with a flush of vexation: " I wish you were&#xD;
us good as you are ingenious."             a&#xD;
" Are you making love, Sir ?"&#xD;
Onme of those potent hands of hers, which&#xD;
neused to fasten his head to the pillow, and to im-&#xD;
pose silence on his lips during the vagaries of -&#xD;
ullness, was placed on her forehead, the tips ofa&#xD;
the fingers resting just over her eyes. There&#xD;
glance which she threw at him was literally&#xD;
&#xD;
sifted through her fingers. Her attitude show&#xD;
ed to advantage her white round arm and dainty&#xD;
wrist. Felix had a passion for white arms and&#xD;
dainty wrists. He experienced a thrill of pain&#xD;
and uncertainty.&#xD;
" No," he answered, with a sigh ; "I am&#xD;
making folly!"&#xD;
Anna dropped her eyelids pensively; she&#xD;
expressed soft languor and soft melancholy ;&#xD;
most dangerous moods in woman; they make&#xD;
the heart ache worst of all. He could now con-&#xD;
template her at discretion-her sentinels being&#xD;
called in. Pride came to his aid, to make or mar.&#xD;
"Folly," he added, unamiably, "is a part of&#xD;
the business of life. Was I making love? I&#xD;
had no thought of it. My head is bad. As&#xD;
you say insanity intermits with sanity. I ache&#xD;
wretchedly across the brows."&#xD;
Felix lied ; lie ached lower than that ; and&#xD;
never more than when lie was uttering the false-&#xD;
hood. He thought he had lost his case ; that&#xD;
defeat was evident and final.' Seeing her there&#xD;
before him proved only how much he had lost,&#xD;
or, rather, how much he had not won. He&#xD;
doomed himself miserable for the rest of his&#xD;
life. He wished he had been shot when the&#xD;
chance was offered him.&#xD;
" Ice water I" murmured Anna.&#xD;
"Spare your anxiety, Miss Conway, I shall&#xD;
get over this by to-morrow. I have a wonder-&#xD;
ful faculty of throwing off things!" He said&#xD;
this insidiously. He meant: "Your love is&#xD;
one of the things that I mean to throw off with-&#xD;
out any trouble." -&#xD;
It was his firm conviction that she was a&#xD;
woman without heart Under this revulsion of&#xD;
feeling he was ready to say something unkind.&#xD;
He wished to wound her, and wondered where&#xD;
she was vulnerable. Could he have found a&#xD;
sensitive spot, he would have been as cruel as a&#xD;
Turk. There is little mercy in a jilted man.&#xD;
His loving sweetness soon sours. Love and&#xD;
hate lie close together; but Felix was not one&#xD;
to give place to the latter. He could be proud,&#xD;
angry, and provoking, but not vindictive,&#xD;
"f will go," said Anna ; "you tire of my&#xD;
ociety."&#xD;
" I am tired - of myself; that is the only&#xD;
weariness I feel," retorted Westerly, brusquely.&#xD;
"I should like to be exchanged."&#xD;
"Bear your fate heroically;," continued An-_&#xD;
ia, smiling. ' You will be at liberty in a few&#xD;
months, no do bt."&#xD;
" A few months are a few ages ! Have you&#xD;
not prisons here ? Give me back my promise&#xD;
nd send me to prison."_&#xD;
Ile arose, went to a window, and looked out-&#xD;
with a frownin brow.&#xD;
"e content.Sir," answered Anna, somewhat&#xD;
piqued. We'll -increase your sufferings, by-&#xD;
and by. You would like the credit of being a&#xD;
martyr to liberty. We cannot afford to make&#xD;
martyrs."&#xD;

there remained to him but scattered fragments  " Spanish flies and ice !" continued Barnaby,&#xD;

time it had not flattened against his tibia, but upon his train. "Jilted by Miss Anna I"&#xD;

much at what Barnaby had said, as at his ex-&#xD;
pression.&#xD;

himself from his climax byya beautiful grada-&#xD;

"I'll do it," said Westerly, trying to look&#xD;
serious.&#xD;
" My sperrit," added Barnaby, sentimentally,&#xD;
"will hover about Blue Clay Creek. Under&#xD;
the south side of a pine log you'll find a gray&#xD;
shoddy breeches. Keep 'em !"&#xD;
Just as he reached this touching conclusion,&#xD;
Miss Conway entered the room hastily. She&#xD;
shut and bolted the door before speaking. She'&#xD;
was pale and agitated. Felix was struck with&#xD;
the change that had come over her since he&#xD;
last saw hdr. She was no longer arch. and&#xD;
smiling. The charming coquetry of the maid-&#xD;
en was laid aside for the higher responsibilities&#xD;
of the hour and the woman. Ile saw at once&#xD;
that something unexpected had happened. He&#xD;
bowed, and waited to hear what it was.&#xD;
" We have unpleasant visitorsI" she said. "I&#xD;
have come to tell you that you are in great dan-&#xD;
ger."&#xD;
" I suspected'as much," answered Felix.&#xD;
"We're on our peril o' honor I" interrupted&#xD;
Barnaby, with spirit. "Our peril o' bonor isn't&#xD;
a gwine to be introoded on, is it? We know&#xD;
which is milingtary rules, Mem."&#xD;
Westerly made a motion forhim to be silent.&#xD;
"Those men," resumed Anna, pointing to the&#xD;
window, "are lawless."&#xD;
"I had arrived at that conclusion," said the&#xD;
young man.&#xD;
" Whether they mistrust your presence in this&#xD;
house, I do nit know," she went on, her anxiety&#xD;
being sufficiently perceptible in her manner.&#xD;
"But should they discover .you, I confess my&#xD;
utter inability to protect you. As for your&#xD;
friend Barnaby, hia fate would be summary and&#xD;
instant; for it is generally understoodin this&#xD;
vicinity, that he has been under the Confeder-&#xD;
ate flag, but has since -taken service under&#xD;
General Grant. You, Sir, it makes me blush to&#xD;
say, would fare little better than your attend-&#xD;
ant. You must leave this place."&#xD;
"It must be speedily, then I" remarkedFe-&#xD;
lix.&#xD;
"They'll be ramsackin' the house soon," said&#xD;
Barnaby. "You can't keep such critters as&#xD;
them from plunder."&#xD;
"I am trying to gain time," resumed Anna,&#xD;
exhibiting much firmness. "The servants of&#xD;
the house and plantation are car ying them&#xD;
food."&#xD;
"Let 'em roll out a berril o' whisky," sug-&#xD;
gested Barnaby.&#xD;
" Ai order to that effect has been given.&#xD;
The spirit will prove sufficiently attractive to&#xD;
engage their present attention ; but whisky, you&#xD;
know, makes lawless men savages."&#xD;
Felix now beheld Anna in a new character,&#xD;
and one so different from any she had yet dis-&#xD;
played that he was much surprised. Her pale;&#xD;
mess and perturbation did not rob her of her&#xD;
&#xD;
beauty, and she appeared in this, as in all other&#xD;
situations in which he had seen her, to advan.&#xD;
tage. She was not now the bewildering maiden,&#xD;
but the lovely, earnest, and.graceful woman, to&#xD;
be admirred, deferred to, and obeyed.&#xD;
The clamorous voices of the Confederate par-&#xD;
tisans rose higher and higher without, and it was&#xD;
evident that their orgies had begun.&#xD;
Anna moved across the room, and drew the&#xD;
curtains more closely,&#xD;
"Tell me, Miss Conway, what you propose to&#xD;
do, and I shall be but too willing to second your&#xD;
exertions,". said Felix. " And, dear young&#xD;
lady," he continued) in a tone not quite steady,&#xD;
"allow me to express my fears for your safety,&#xD;
as well as mine and Barnaby's. I am sure that&#xD;
you ought not to be here. Those men of un-&#xD;
bridled tongue and unlicensed appetite will soon&#xD;
overstep that boundary within which the help-&#xD;
lessness of women is respected."&#xD;
" As the time is short, my answers must be&#xD;
brief. In lhe rear of the house there is a wood,&#xD;
at this distnee, thick and impenetrable to the&#xD;
eye. Beta een us and it, there is considerable&#xD;
shrubbery ; enough, I think, to insure a safe&#xD;
exit, with ordinary cautiousness."&#xD;
" We are to gain the wood, unperceived,"&#xD;
observed Felix.&#xD;
" Where you will find horses and guides&#xD;
awaiting you, provided all goes well," said&#xD;
Anna.&#xD;
The marauders outside grew more uproarious,&#xD;
Their mirth grew into a terrible chorus of con-&#xD;
fusion.&#xD;
Anna glanced at the window with a shiver.&#xD;
" You are to understand, ' she resumed, " that&#xD;
accidents may delay, and, possibly, entirely&#xD;
frustrate a part of this plan. Bit you are to be&#xD;
patient, and wait a suitable time after reaching&#xD;
the wood for the horses. The moment for&#xD;
leaving the house is at hand, and I hope you&#xD;
will be very prudent. The whisky, you may&#xD;
notice, has begun to operate, and the men will&#xD;
soon tire of inaction, and become discursive and&#xD;
prying."&#xD;
''Miss Conway," cried Felix, "I fear more&#xD;
foryou than for myself I'Who are your pro&#xD;
tectors ? What assurance have you of safety?.&#xD;
I will not stir without you; or, at least, I will&#xD;
not attempt to save myself while I have any-&#xD;
doubt of your security."&#xD;
The Confederates sent up a shout that shook&#xD;
the windows. . Anna recoiled, as if from a&#xD;
blow.&#xD;
" Your care for me is generous; and your&#xD;
fears, perhaps, are not ill-grounded," she re-&#xD;
plied, with some warmth. I am sensible of your&#xD;
kindness, and I hope you will be content when&#xD;
I inform you that my safety is already provided&#xD;
for. Do not persistin the determination you&#xD;
have expressed, for such persistence will seri-&#xD;
ously interfere with my purpose. Yield, Sir, to&#xD;

&#xD;
now I think of it, I do not remember tohave&#xD;
noticed your face before."'&#xD;
" Nor I yours !" said the young man, tartly.&#xD;
S" And yet it is a clean one!" continued the&#xD;
Confederate, facetiously. " And clean prices are&#xD;
by io means common among us. - My nearest&#xD;
neighbor rode- beside me three days without&#xD;
being' known '-to me. He ivashed his face at a&#xD;
brook, and that was the way I recognized him&#xD;
at Blast. When- I shook hands with nini, and&#xD;
asked how his family was,-he grinned and want-&#xD;
ed to 'know if I hadn't known him before. If I&#xD;
ivere Colonel Allerton, I'd have every rman of&#xD;
the -regiment wash his face before going into&#xD;
battle, so that the killed might be identified by&#xD;
thieik friends."&#xD;
Felit thought of the man in the jockey-cap,&#xD;
and made up his mind that he was Colonel Al-&#xD;
lerton. Seizing upon circumstances not before&#xD;
noticdd, and connecting them by a sudden flash&#xD;
of intelligence, he reacted this conclusion with&#xD;
a strong consciousness that it was true. The&#xD;
mind often solves difficulties so quickly that it&#xD;
is not easy to follow its rapid workings. He&#xD;
had heard of ColonelAllerton as a leader of&#xD;
mounted Rebel partisans. Some persons, the&#xD;
Federals among them, called these partisans'&#xD;
bushwhackers, guerrillas, and 'outlaws.  But1&#xD;
the. Confederate nation called 'them  soldiers.&#xD;
He jotted it~down in-his mental book that his&#xD;
treacherous guide had been this noted chief;&#xD;
and it was straight-into his woodland camp that&#xD;
he 'bad led him. These things went drifting&#xD;
through his mind like waifs on the waters of&#xD;
thought..&#xD;
"You should be high in the confidehee of&#xD;
your leader," he remarked, edging away from&#xD;
.the spot ; for the'stranger'had been gradually&#xD;
approaching him, and had shortened the dis-&#xD;
tance more than Felix had increased it. He&#xD;
was now within two yards of the young man,&#xD;
eyeing him closely._&#xD;
"By Heavens I" he exclaimed; "you are a&#xD;
Federal!"                 -&#xD;
Felix did not stir, but heyfelt his'blood thrill-&#xD;
Ing wondrously. All'seemed lost. He appear-&#xD;
ed doomed to captivity. In the present escape,&#xD;
he had founded hopes of seeing Anna-of meet-&#xD;
ing her somewhere in a mysterious manner, and&#xD;
thatsotnething better than all the past would&#xD;
grow out of it. To be baffed on the threshold&#xD;
of success was a blow that he was not prepared&#xD;
for.&#xD;
What should he say? More important still,&#xD;
what'should he'do?      '&#xD;
'The Confederate exhibited to hirl,.in his'own&#xD;
person, six feet two of sturdy bone and season-&#xD;
c tausel.'" A dangerous ;antagonist for, a man&#xD;
weak fiotn' illness. In the iutax of multitudi-&#xD;
nous thAoughts there is silence and inaction. ..Ai&#xD;
e.iotional mnorment precedes eve y deed.&#xD;
"Stand, 'lir 1" added the'Cofedefate, 'in a&#xD;
&#xD;
suppressed tone. "Do not attempt anything..&#xD;
Yield, rescue, or no rescue."&#xD;
" Do not be misled by my looks, comrade,"'&#xD;
stain mered Westerly ; "the same mistake has&#xD;
occurr l before."&#xD;
" I shouldn't ivonder if it had occurred late-&#xD;
ly I  retorted' the  Rebel partisan, quietly.&#xD;
"Faith ! you look to rne like a convalescent&#xD;
prisoner. Come, Sir, you might as well give it'&#xD;
up, and own that you are cornered."&#xD;
"Ypu seem really a good-natured fellow,"&#xD;
sail Felix, greatly perplexed. " I have pressing.&#xD;
business on hand ; let us shake hands and part."&#xD;
"That proposition may look very reasonable,&#xD;
to you, but I may be of a different mind. Do&#xD;
not look so pale about the mouth; I do not&#xD;
propose to kill you-at least, not immediate-&#xD;
ly."'&#xD;
The courteous Rebel smiled. Felix saw Bar-&#xD;
naby creeping toward his-captor.&#xD;
"No matter what your intentions may be,-&#xD;
personally," Felix replied, "the result will be&#xD;
the same ; for I have reason to believe that&#xD;
your fellows will'-not receive me as a prisoner-&#xD;
of war ; so that you will be, in fact, the author'&#xD;
of many death. 1 should judge by your counte-&#xD;
nance, that you can derive little satisfaction&#xD;
from seeing me hanged.' For God's sake ! let me&#xD;
go my way!"     .&#xD;
" More easily said than done," responded the&#xD;
Rebel, musingly. "It might go ill with me if it&#xD;
were known that I had connived at the escape&#xD;
of a Yankee."&#xD;
' I'm not going to escape," returned Felix,&#xD;
" save from these mounted banditti. I'm, in.&#xD;
truth, on parole, and shall observe it."&#xD;
"By whom paroled?" demanded the part&#xD;
san.,&#xD;
Felix's face -grew red.&#xD;
" To a lady," he answered.&#xD;
His captor- laughed, and tapping him upon&#xD;
the shoulder, said :&#xD;
" That won't do, my fine fellow -"&#xD;
Barnaby was now within three yards of him.&#xD;
His stealthy approach was yet unnoticed.&#xD;
"I grant its- appareuit absurdity," faltered&#xD;
Fehir, "and yet I swear to you it is literally&#xD;
true."&#xD;
" You have been sick," added the man, look-&#xD;
ing at his prisoner, thoughtfully.&#xD;
" Wounded and ill, and my life despaired of.&#xD;
The lady in question lifted me from the gates&#xD;
of death."&#xD;
" A love-tale should follow," lie muttered,,&#xD;
uneasily. "It's a pity to spoil so fine a begin*&#xD;
ming." ,.&#xD;
-Feli watched his face softening with intense&#xD;
interest. Barnaby, just , behind the' partisan's&#xD;
back, was gathering himself together and con-&#xD;
tracting his muscles 't spring. Felix .saw. an.&#xD;
ugly pocket-knife in his hand.  .&#xD;
The voices of advancing pereonsreached theit&#xD;
ears.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Young man," said the partisan, sinking his&#xD;
'voice nearly to a whisper, " care not to be the&#xD;
agent of your death."&#xD;
"Nor I of yours," said Felix, making a slight&#xD;
admontory motion to Barnaby.&#xD;
"I do not understand you," replied the Con-;&#xD;
federate ;- " but no matter. Take my arm and&#xD;
pass on with me to yonder negro-hut."&#xD;
" Before you stir, swear ti me that you are&#xD;
acting in good faith," said Felix, with an earn-&#xD;
estness that the Rebel did not comprehend.&#xD;
" It is a singular requ st," he inswered&#xD;
gravely, "but it is granted.  Take..the will,&#xD;
.however, for the dead, as we have small time&#xD;
for formal swearing."'&#xD;
" Look behind you," said Felix, "and know&#xD;
that your life has been at my mercy for the&#xD;
last thirty seconds. Your magnanimity has&#xD;
not been lost; it has saved you from a hand&#xD;
that strikes hard and deep."  1&#xD;
" A follower of yours ?" observed the stran-&#xD;
ger, calmly. "It was well done, and kindly&#xD;
stopped. Let him come after us."         .&#xD;
The humane Rebel took Westerly's arm, and&#xD;
they walked away from the house together,&#xD;
Barnaby sauntering after them, a knot of out-&#xD;
Jaws close at his heels, shouting coarse jests and&#xD;
singing'ribald songs.&#xD;
"I would reach yonder wood, if practicable 1"1&#xD;
whispered Felix.&#xD;
"Look j hat way again !" was the response.&#xD;
Felix turned his head, and saw some Confed-&#xD;
erates watering their horses at a spring directly&#xD;
between him and the wood..    ,&#xD;
"1'will be necessary to'make .a long detour&#xD;
to reach that point," observed his generous ene-&#xD;
my. "When we have arrived at the but I s&#xD;
have mentioned, you shall exercise your judg- a&#xD;
meat about the best method of getting away.&#xD;
Those fellows at the spring are eyeing us ; but&#xD;
I am sufficiently known to avert unpleasant sus-&#xD;
picion."  ..&#xD;
Passing under the branches of some large&#xD;
trees, and crossing a 'little swale, they reached&#xD;
the hut spoken of in a few minutes. It was notT&#xD;
empty, but occupied by an old negress, who sat&#xD;
in a melancholy attitude on a straw mat, rock- a&#xD;
ing her'shriveled body to and fro. The parti-&#xD;
san drew back when.he saw her.&#xD;
" It's of no consequence," lie 'said. "The s&#xD;
old creature is absorbed in her own troubles,&#xD;
and will not notice us. I came here to give I&#xD;
you this weapon, and also a few words of ad- a&#xD;
vice. If you would find the Federal gunboats,&#xD;
your course is due south. If you value life,&#xD;
avoid the small bands of guerrillas that infest&#xD;
the country, many of whom are like the Skin- ti&#xD;
ners of the Revolution in their habits."   'r&#xD;
He paused, and handed Wester ly a revolver. in&#xD;
The young man recognized the manufacture, R&#xD;
for it was of Federal make, and he had, seen o&#xD;
many such in the Navy and Army.             ti&#xD;
" As tor your friend," he continued, "I can&#xD;
&#xD;
do little for him, and he must trust to luck.&#xD;
The mate to that sturdy joker"-he glanced at&#xD;
the pistol-" I cannot well part with.&#xD;
"Ishall.never forget this kindnessI" exclaimed&#xD;
Felix, with enthusiasm.&#xD;
"You would I have done me a serious mis-&#xD;
chief, I think !" said the man, addressing Barna-&#xD;
by, with 'a significant lifting of the brows.&#xD;
" Death by a pocket-knife would have been dis-&#xD;
graceful. You are a muscular fellow, and it&#xD;
strikes me that your face is not altogether&#xD;
strange."&#xD;
The Rebel's'keen gray eyes pierced Barnaby&#xD;
through and through.&#xD;
" I wern't born in this kentry," said Barna-&#xD;
by.&#xD;
" I see you were not," retorted the Confeden"&#xD;
ate, good-naturedly.&#xD;
"Ther's a right smart chance o' blood water&#xD;
alween me and the place I wer' born in," pe&#xD;
sisted the Sandhiller, stoutly.&#xD;
"I perceive," answered the Rebel, frowning,&#xD;
"that.you prefer Federal to Confederate shod-&#xD;
dy ; and I think myself that that fabric is.not&#xD;
so vile as the other. Hemp, it seems to me,&#xD;
should give peculiar sensations when your eye&#xD;
chances to light upon it."&#xD;
"As a furriner,"said Barnaby, sharply,."I'&#xD;
do not understand your illoosions. I'm from&#xD;
the low kentries, Sir."&#xD;
"Very low, indeed I" sneered th Rebel&#xD;
" Better have kept at your gamecocks and blue&#xD;
elay.  In future, don't venture beyond the&#xD;
range of the Yankee gunboats."&#xD;
Then'to Felix:&#xD;
" I must leave you. I have already been ab-&#xD;
sent too long. If you do not live to tell the&#xD;
story of to-day, 'twill be no fault of mine,"&#xD;
. " I should like to know," said Felix, warmly,&#xD;
" the name of my generous foe."&#xD;
" That," answered the partisan, "is asking too&#xD;
much. It would not be prudent to give you&#xD;
my real name, and to give you a false one&#xD;
would be to round a good deed with a lie. 'So&#xD;
we part here."&#xD;
He looked back after he had turned to go,&#xD;
nd added, with grim humor:&#xD;
"Mind your parole,. young man I"&#xD;
These words were spoken in a way to mean&#xD;
o much that Felix could not repress a smile.&#xD;
"He won't forgit the leddy, Sir '' affirmed&#xD;
Barnaby, winking slyly at the stranger, who made&#xD;
parting gesture with his hand, and left them.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
The last scene. occurred before the door of&#xD;

,ockiuig her shrunken body to and fro, mutter-&#xD;

ebel had gone ; but neither Felix nor Barnaby&#xD;

The Colonel shuffled about uneasily, much&#xD;
affected by the womaL's information concerning&#xD;
what had been passing at the house.&#xD;
" I 'speet you knows a good deal, Colonel,&#xD;

Chloe was very dismal, indeed. But Allerton&#xD;
was intent on another subject ; he was thinking&#xD;
of Felix Westerly's nurse.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIIL&#xD;
UNDER FOOT.,-'&#xD;
Felix and Barnaby, meanwhile, having passed&#xD;
down a ladder; found themselves in a very dark-&#xD;
place. So absolute was the darkness, that they&#xD;
"eould not see the faintest glimpse' of each oth-&#xD;
er; aud the hand held up before the eyes was&#xD;
quite invisible. They were obviously standing,&#xD;
upon-the ground, and were at first afraid ' to&#xD;
mov.e lest they should disturb something and&#xD;
make a noise. But when Felix heard Allertpn's&#xD;
voice,the could not master hiscuriosity. Gras p-&#xD;
ing the [adder firmly, he ascended far enough to&#xD;
bring his ear near the floor, and in that position&#xD;
heard the conversation. His interest was most&#xD;
awakened when the Colonel reached that part of&#xD;
the colloquy which concerned Anna. For the&#xD;
tine being, he ceased to regret his detention.&#xD;
But that which he wished most to learn was yet&#xD;
withheld.,&#xD;
While Felix was listening,- Barnaby began to&#xD;
feel cautiously about him. By-and-by he found&#xD;
a heap of straw, anl thrusting his hand into it&#xD;
to satisfy a natural inquisitiveness, he touched&#xD;
cold iron. Continuing his investigations, he&#xD;
soon discovered that a farge number of muskets&#xD;
were concealed there. Dn another heap were&#xD;
kegs of powder, while in a third, were some&#xD;
rusty sabres and flint-lock pistols. Barpaby&#xD;
thought this a favorable opportunity to arm&#xD;
himself; and after considerable groping, was&#xD;
lueky-enough to find an artillery-sword, which&#xD;
he buckled to his side with much satisfaction.&#xD;
It was a heavy weapon, but Barnaby was strong,&#xD;
nud not to he daunted by a bit of steel. Hav-'&#xD;
ing thus prepared himself for warlike pursuits,&#xD;
he felt his way to Felix about the time thlit tee&#xD;
conversation reached - that point to which we&#xD;
have brought it.&#xD;
" You are infernal hypocrites all I" muttered&#xD;
Colonel Allerton. Then he amended it by add-&#xD;
hug:-"Hypocrites or simpletons; but let -that&#xD;
go.. The negro-question is being solved by the&#xD;
sword ; and I am inclined to the opinion that the&#xD;
vexations black institution is on its last legs.&#xD;
Let it alone, old woman,, for I wish your aten-&#xD;
tion to other matters."&#xD;
b That yer is not the institution you're think-&#xD;
ia' of, Mars'r I" observed Chloe, significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You've got a white institution in your hest&#xD;
now."&#xD;
She chuckled quietly over this inuendo.&#xD;
' The complaint is not in my head !" said the&#xD;
Colonel, with a shrug. "It's under my vest&#xD;
so the rascal didn't die?"&#xD;
'" Whieh rascal, Mars'r ?" asked Chloe, some-&#xD;
what of her enthusiasm returning.&#xD;
"The Yankee officer I" exclaimed the Colo-&#xD;
nel.&#xD;
Then striking himself upon the arm with one&#xD;
of his gauntlets, which he had drawn: off and&#xD;
held in his sight hand, he added, speaking to&#xD;
himself:&#xD;
"Stupid race! They always affect ignorance&#xD;
when they know the most."&#xD;
"Is that 'o icer m your way, Colonel?"&#xD;
" Terribly in my way, Chloe! More in my&#xD;
way than I shall tell. So much in my way,&#xD;
that it drives me mad to think of it."&#xD;
Allerton's scowling brow expressed more than&#xD;
his words.&#xD;
" Don't!" said Chloe. " You look as if you'd&#xD;
kill somebody if you had a chance. But -she&#xD;
was mighty fond on him," she continued, in a&#xD;
tone highly exasperating to the jealous Colonel.&#xD;
"With him a heap, Miss Anna was. Night,&#xD;
morning , and noon, they was together. What&#xD;
they foun' to talk 'bout, the goodness only&#xD;
knows."&#xD;
" How thelhag tortures me !" murmured Al-&#xD;
lerton. Then to the negress, a sterner expres-&#xD;
sion giving additional gloominess to his visage:&#xD;
"Is he at the house now?"&#xD;
-In asking this he let his voice drop a little,&#xD;
and watched Chloe's lips for an answer.&#xD;
Barnaby, who was now a party to the convert&#xD;
sation, gave Felix a push  in the ribs with his&#xD;
elbow.&#xD;
"lie won't leave as long as he can stay I" re-&#xD;
plied Chloe, who seemed in no hurry to get rid&#xD;
of the Colonel. "Shouldn't wonder, Mars'r, if&#xD;
he took the oath of illegiance."&#xD;
" Never !" thundered Allerton, striking his&#xD;
foot upon the floor so vehemently that it made&#xD;
the hut shake.&#xD;
The frail floor quivered over Felix' head.&#xD;
Barnaby gave him another push, which came&#xD;
near tipping  im from the ladder.&#xD;
What a wic ed look !" mumbled Chloe.&#xD;
" What becme of the fellow who was with&#xD;
him, half-servant and half-friend?" demanded&#xD;
the Colonel.&#xD;
" A tall. lanky, weasen-faced chap, Mars'r 2"&#xD;
inquired the negress, innocently..&#xD;
It was now Felix's turn to nudge Barnaby.&#xD;
" Yes," said Allerton.&#xD;
" With a large~ mouth, crooked nose, blear&#xD;
eyes, sharp chin, lantern jaws, and face all&#xD;
spattered with freckles, Mars'r ?"&#xD;
" Something like that, I confess," assented&#xD;
the Colonel, not very patiently.&#xD;
Barnaby shook his fist toward the upper ra-&#xD;

the blade from its sheath to exhibit its good&#xD;
qualities.&#xD;
' it will do to chop trees with. But it seems&#xD;
to me that we should be near the spot spoken&#xD;
of by the lady. Look in every direction, Bar-&#xD;

diameter at every turn, and be cautious that&#xD;

" I'll go farther before turning to the right&#xD;
or left," replied the Sandhiller ; and,after a brief&#xD;
pause, proceeded with prudent deliberation, but&#xD;

the spot.&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
Tnz POULTar-YAnD.&#xD;
-Barnaby was born under a star which took&#xD;
special delight in leading him into trouble.&#xD;
Had it not been for this malevolent orb, lie&#xD;
would have lived, moved, and had a being under&#xD;
different eireimstances. A well-behaved planet&#xD;
would not have dropped him on a sandhill, nor&#xD;
selected a dipper and a clipper for his parents.'&#xD;
If any power was to blame for his' ill-luck, it&#xD;
was this bad-principled star. Nor was it con-&#xD;
tent with starting him wrong; it continually&#xD;
interfered with his affairs. It not onlywithheld&#xD;
from him riches, education, and 'place in the&#xD;
world, but it blinded and misguided him so that&#xD;
he did not fully realize the loss of these, and as&#xD;
a general thing, liked folly as well as wisdom.&#xD;
There is no doubt but many persons are imposed&#xD;
upon by the heavenly-bodies without knowing&#xD;
it, and Barnaby was of the number.&#xD;
But Barnaby was of an iron-clad disposition,&#xD;
and had a spirit to repel'the assaults of fortune.&#xD;
He could be tolerably happy where others&#xD;
would, be intolerably miserable. There was a&#xD;
great deal of mirth id him, aid he not unfre-&#xD;
quently lagghed ,when he should have wept.&#xD;
&#xD;
He never knew when to cry. Had he not been&#xD;
deprived of this knowledge, he could have been&#xD;
as wretched as a millionaire. The lower down&#xD;
we go on the social ladder, the more fun we find.&#xD;
Fun was very funny to Barnaby, and was the&#xD;
will-o'the wisp that led his life ; he ran after, it&#xD;
as belated travelers follow that deceitful light&#xD;
No matter Humor kept him happy. His&#xD;
spirits flowed on when his rations stopped ; yet&#xD;
an empty stomach lie esteemed one of the worst&#xD;
evils of existence.&#xD;
Sandhiller had fasted since morning. It was&#xD;
now four o'clock. Ile had breakfasted lightly,&#xD;
prudently reserving his powers of mastication&#xD;
for a prospective dinner much to his mird. Ho&#xD;
felt the gnawings ani entreatings of his gastric&#xD;
juices. aIn plain Saxon, he was 'hungry ; and&#xD;
having walked some time without finding those&#xD;
he was in search of, he began to feel like making&#xD;
a raid on a poultry-yard, or 'asking for a crust.&#xD;
of bread at the door of some negro shanty. 'Co'&#xD;
do. him justice, he did think of duty befero&#xD;
pleasure, and made what he called a rightt&#xD;
smart circumbendibus " before beginning to&#xD;
reconnoitre for pillage.&#xD;
Barnaby knew all about the country. He&#xD;
could tell by the lay of the land where to lo'k&#xD;
for solitary cabins and isolated huts. Paused&#xD;
he and pondered.    When a blue-clay eaker&#xD;
stops and thinks, ten chances to one if he doea&#xD;
not arrive at something.&#xD;
He climbed a tree-and that was the climax&#xD;
that he reached by cogitation, assisted by arus&#xD;
and legs as muscular backers, Barnaby sawv a&#xD;
smoke-a small shaft of black' smoke rising&#xD;
above the branches, and dissolving in air. This&#xD;
carbonic signal was not far off; and, slipping&#xD;
down from his observatory, lie proceeded toward&#xD;
it without further mental parley. It was not&#xD;
long before he arrivedat one of those crazy&#xD;
structures too common in the. South, inhabited&#xD;
by thriftless whites, whose laziness being greater&#xD;
than their amubitiopm, leads them to prefer squal-&#xD;
id idleness to healthy activity and wholesome&#xD;
competence. Barnaby knew the mark of the&#xD;
beast; it was a signature that lie found on his&#xD;
own forehead at birth, and be could no more&#xD;
wash it off than Mrs. Bhiebeard could wash the&#xD;
bloody key clean.&#xD;
He halted on the margin of the little opening&#xD;
in which the hut stood, and tonk a prudent sur-&#xD;
ve of the same before advancing.&#xD;
arnaby could see but one attractive feature,,&#xD;
which was a'poultry-house and yard, both con-&#xD;
structed of round sticks. This concern, though.&#xD;
built with much more care and taste than the&#xD;
shanty, was put together as a lazy man puts,&#xD;
everything together-in a loose and shiftless&#xD;
manner. The Saudhiller had a lurking tender-&#xD;
ness for potilterers and poultry-yards, which&#xD;
was only equaled' by his contempt of fowls&#xD;
which scratch in the pfeceful walks of life. He.&#xD;
valued that domestic race for its fghting quah.i&#xD;

BARNABY, THE E$ANDIULLER.           63&#xD;
&#xD;
ties alone. Game birds had beauties for his&#xD;
eyes, and no others. He set his face like a flint&#xD;
against Bothe*'em Pootrarns of all kinds. Dork-&#xD;
ings and Shanghaes he scorned to mention.&#xD;
Black Spanish and white Spanish, Polands, and&#xD;
Hamburgs were of no account. It was the proud&#xD;
and defiant game-crower that filled him with&#xD;
delight, and put his enthusiasm aglow.&#xD;
Barnaby heard a short and. decisive crow.&#xD;
He detected the peculiarity at once ; it was like&#xD;
.he quiek blast of a trumpet, which summons&#xD;
conflicting squadrons to the charge. He knew&#xD;
the battle-note of the game-cock. Without fur-&#xD;
ther delay, he approached the yard, and looked&#xD;
in. He saw, in several small compartments&#xD;
made of sticks, some fine crowers, nicely trim.&#xD;
med, and evidently in fighting condition ; while&#xD;
one, more stately still, walked untrammeled&#xD;
among a bevy of hens, going now and then to&#xD;
offer combat to the others through the narrow&#xD;
kerstices.&#xD;
4 fine chapI" muttered Barnaby. "Though&#xD;
I shouldn't mind matchin' ny Earl Derby again&#xD;
him, two to one."   He glanced toward the&#xD;
shanty, to see if any persons were stirring. Dis-&#xD;
covering no signs of life,, he spent a few mo-&#xD;
ments in examining critically the claims of the&#xD;
different birds to excellence. He forgot Felix&#xD;
and the horses and guides. He designated the&#xD;
various breeds with professional correctness..&#xD;
"Thet yer," lie said, in moderate solus, "is a&#xD;
lngin bird, smooth, slim, and rether ugly ; thet&#xD;
neat is a durned Mexican. The one right op-&#xD;
A)osite is some kind of a Yankee cross, but a&#xD;
plucky crittur in the pit. This yer is a little&#xD;
t~uban game thet don't weigh more nor three.&#xD;
ounds and a quarter, with a wicked eye, and&#xD;
'never-say-run in it. Here's a English feller,&#xD;
with a black breast, and another with a red. It&#xD;
.tiust be free a nigger that owns all these yer,&#xD;
tior white folks isn't apt to have so many to&#xD;
onet, on account of not being able to buy 'em.&#xD;
I shouldn't wonder," added the Sandhiller, with&#xD;
another cautious look around the premises, "if&#xD;
,a couple of ye went 'long a me ; for the Cap-&#xD;
tin and I is pooty sharp set."&#xD;
He put a sagacious finger to his forehead.&#xD;
"Wher' then' is hens, then' should be eggs I"&#xD;
said Barnaby.&#xD;
Opening the door of the poultry-house, and&#xD;
stooping quite low, he went in ana peered at&#xD;
the nests.&#xD;
"Here they be l" quoth he, with a scarcely&#xD;
audible whistle of satisfaction. " Wonder how&#xD;
'he keeps the old woman from    eating' 'em.&#xD;
'Twould make a precious row if she took one, I&#xD;
,allow. 'Tis a paguy pity to eat 'em But&#xD;
these is war timed, and I'11 confiscate 'em, any-&#xD;
ways.  May want to set 'em, Who knows?&#xD;
Per aps I may git a chance to send 4 couple on&#xD;
em to home, though   'peet I11 send some on&#xD;
'em by a shorter route nor thet.' Ther's chink?&#xD;
ngs in' these yep, widhla worth hevin'. Wher'll&#xD;
&#xD;
I put 'em ? Here's a dozen, all told. Four 'II&#xD;
go into the slack o' my cap. four more into my&#xD;
.iaeket-pocket ; these four 'II be left, and two or&#xD;
three o' them 'lI go a road I know of."&#xD;
Barnaby suited the action to the word, put.&#xD;
ting four eggs in hie foraging cap, which filled&#xD;
what he called the "slack" of it pretty well, and,&#xD;
which obliged him to put his head into it, in-&#xD;
stead of putting it upon his head ; the other&#xD;
four went ipt an outside pocket of hisjacket,&#xD;
while two of those that remained, lie cracked&#xD;
and swallowed. Confidant that the latter wer&#xD;
safely disposed of, and that raw eggs were nour-&#xD;
ishing, he sent the remaining two to keep them&#xD;
company.&#xD;
He was about to pass one of his long arms&#xD;
into a coop, to secure a well.conditioned fowl,&#xD;
when the sound of voices caused him to pause&#xD;
in his operations. Foragers do very well when&#xD;
they are not disturbed; but it is awkward to be&#xD;
caught robbing hen-roosts. Barnaby stood still&#xD;
and listened. When voices are heard, it is a&#xD;
sure sign somebody is near ; and in this partic-&#xD;
ular instance the author of the voices were&#xD;
too near to admit of the Sandhiiller's escape.&#xD;
Looking through the airy latticework, he saw&#xD;
a man approaching on foot, followed by two&#xD;
men on horseback. Barnaby, seeing what kind&#xD;
of visitors he was likely to have, had sensations&#xD;
that were decidedly disagreeable. Jie was the&#xD;
subject of a predicament, and was fully sensible&#xD;
of it. In entering the fowl-house, lie had closed&#xD;
the small door arter him; but it being open-&#xD;
work, it was no great protection to him. -e.&#xD;
treating to the farthest limit of the small in-&#xD;
closure, he' flattened himself against the sticks&#xD;
and poles, and kept as motionless as a scare.&#xD;
crow in a cornfield op a still day. Up came the&#xD;
person walking, and up came the horsemen.&#xD;
The latter, Barnaby concluded, belonged to the&#xD;
party he had seen that day, and their sabres&#xD;
clanked ominously as they rode.&#xD;
The sight of the poultry.yard put the riders&#xD;
in good humor. One, our forager observed,&#xD;
wore shoulder-straps, but the other did not.&#xD;
With the shoulder-straps was the authority of&#xD;
the occasion. The Sandhiiler had seen enough&#xD;
of shoulder-straps to know that they always&#xD;
had the best of it, and were exceedingly dicta'&#xD;
torial.&#xD;
" Dick," said he of the straps, " tumble off&#xD;
and wring their necks."&#xD;
The individual called Dick had as much as&#xD;
he could do to keep from tumbling off without&#xD;
being bidden ; and being told to do so, tumbled&#xD;
off with.wonderful promptitude, and threw his&#xD;
officer the reins of his horse,&#xD;
Now, it turned out that the man on foot was&#xD;
the proprietor of this belligerent fowl-yard, and&#xD;
his consternation was worthy of notice. He&#xD;
threw himself before Dick with a terrified ex.&#xD;
pression, that was ludicrous.&#xD;
" Don't do that Ver t" he exclaimed, in sa.&#xD;
&#xD;
cents of scared entreaty. " Dunno what yer s&#xD;
'bout, YoU con't, Capting.  Them's the best f&#xD;
games in te k  ,entry."t&#xD;
" I'm glad o' that " answered the cruel Cap- r&#xD;
fain. "'ve heard that them kind is the best s&#xD;
satin'."&#xD;
'eBest eatin' 1" repeated the cock-breeder. a&#xD;
Is mported games the best eatin'!"I&#xD;
gTwist their weasands, Dick I" quoth the a&#xD;
mighty Captain, with an gfroid. Warlike pur-&#xD;
suits render the hearts of Captains peculiarly&#xD;
callous to touchinir appeals. This is the only&#xD;
apology we can think of for this sanguinary b&#xD;
Confederate.&#xD;
"I tell ye them is worth heaps o' money!I"&#xD;
protested the gamedman.1e'Twould do ye good 1&#xD;
to see 'em fight. Goddlemity I"&#xD;
The last startling expletive was wrung from&#xD;
the fancier by the extreme urgency of expres-&#xD;
sion. There are seasons when people must re-a&#xD;
sort to extraordinary ventilation. And this&#xD;
form of utterar co is not without precedent; for t&#xD;
we learn by a captured letter that ote pious&#xD;
Rebel private had prayed to " goddlemity"c&#xD;
concerning the war and its probable ending.E&#xD;
Nothing is positive-everything comparative.&#xD;
Spelling is a mere matter of taste, and the tame&#xD;
may he said of swearing. When swearing is to&#xD;
be done, it is only necessary to swear profanely&#xD;
to give strength to human sentiment. Profan-&#xD;
ity is an evidence of civilization ; that is, itf&#xD;
shows just how far civilization has progressed.&#xD;
Of spelling, the same.&#xD;
The Captain was neither shocked nor moved.&#xD;
1141 lifted up his straps with his warrior shoul-I&#xD;
lers, and repeated his command.&#xD;
 Tell ye what !" added the distracted peti-&#xD;
tioner. " Them yen cocks isn't mine."&#xD;
" Don't make a fuss about 'em, then1" quoth&#xD;
he of the straps.&#xD;
" They b'long to Borrorseale, and they cost&#xD;
himi hunderds of dollars. I'm his trainer, I&#xD;
be,"&#xD;
4;Give him a rap over the head, pick. We&#xD;
raust scamper after the regiment as soon as pos-&#xD;
sible. Allerton's hard on stragglers."&#xD;
Dick, who made it a practice to obey orders&#xD;
when agreeable to his feelings, knocked the&#xD;
game-fancier down with his fist, and stepping&#xD;
over him, pulled open the poultry-house door&#xD;
and blundered in. In a moment there was a furi-&#xD;
ous uproar and scuffle. The fowls set up a&#xD;
deafening clamor, and out came Barnaby and&#xD;
Dick, closely grappled with each other, rolling&#xD;
over and over. 1Barnaby would gladly have re-&#xD;
linquished his hold and taken to his heels, but&#xD;
the Rebel clung tohim with the tenacity of a&#xD;
bull-terrier. The Sandhiller squeezed him, and&#xD;
punched him, and grasping him by the hair,&#xD;
thumped his head upon the ground without in&#xD;
the least affecting his hold. Barnaby wriggled&#xD;
and aquiirmed, imitated the writhing and con-&#xD;
tortions of au eel being skinned, and then&#xD;
&#xD;
BARNABY, TI3E 'SANDHILLER.&#xD;
&#xD;
wore like a trooper. Both presently lay still&#xD;
rom exhaustion, the Sandhiller atop. The lat-&#xD;
er, seeing' two eggs on the ground that had&#xD;
olled out of his ca p, caught them up and.&#xD;
imashed one in each eye of his enemy.&#xD;
The Captain le:po nimbly from the saddle&#xD;
nd ran to the aid of his subordinate. Seizing&#xD;
Barnaby by the throat, he choked him till he&#xD;
was blue in the face.&#xD;
"Quarter !" gurgled Barnaby, and then Dick&#xD;
let up".&#xD;
Barnaby rose gasping, the Captain holding&#xD;
his revolver to his head, and demanding, furi-&#xD;
ously : " Who are ye ?"&#xD;
Barnaby couldn't tell who he was immediate-&#xD;
y; he had to get his breath first, and push the&#xD;
hair and dirt out of his eyes.&#xD;
He answered, by-and-by, with pathos:&#xD;
" I'm a orphing ! My mother was a dipper,&#xD;
and my father was a clipper.",Z&#xD;
" What's that to do with it ?" cried the Cap-&#xD;
tain, shaking the "or phing".&#xD;
"I'm a honest lad'I" added Barnaby, inno-&#xD;
eently. "I bears a bully chariekter, and I've&#xD;
got recommendations to bome."&#xD;
The officer shook him again.&#xD;
" I'm to be shaken afore taken, and notarte'-&#xD;
wards I" said the forager,,beginning to lose tem-&#xD;
per.&#xD;
"What toggery is this ?" asked the Rebel,&#xD;
frowning wrathfully.&#xD;
" Truth is," replied Barnaby, confidentially,&#xD;
" I killed a Yankee and took his clothes."&#xD;
"Did, didye 1" said shoulder-straps, inbredu-&#xD;
lously.&#xD;
By this time the private Dick had scrambled&#xD;
to his feet, and was busying himself with siopp-&#xD;
ing the egg out of his eyes.&#xD;
The game-fancier, who was as much astonish-&#xD;
ed as any one at the unexpected struggle, now&#xD;
examined Barnaby attentively, and said :&#xD;
"I know this chap. He lives down to Blue-&#xD;
Clay Creek. He's quite a breeder hisself, and I&#xD;
matched him once, and lost a five spot."&#xD;
" Blue Clay Creek," repeated the Captain,&#xD;
reflectively.' " What's his name ?"&#xD;
The Sandhiller shook in his shoes. There&#xD;
was likely to be an unpleasant denouement.&#xD;
Events were following rather too fast for safety.&#xD;
After a peaceful interregnum, this was a day of&#xD;
disaster. Barnaby tried to give the fancier an&#xD;
intelligible look.&#xD;
"'Twas Barnaby something," was the answer.&#xD;
"I ken almost remember t'other, but I ken't."&#xD;
The officer took a slip of paper from his vest-&#xD;
pocket, looked at it, and then asked :&#xD;
" Was it Cruise ?"&#xD;
" You needn't say any more I" replied the&#xD;
game-trainer. '-Cruise is the other word of his&#xD;
name."&#xD;
" Here's a error," said Barnaby.&#xD;
"Not quite," answered the Captain. "The&#xD;
error was when you ran away."&#xD;

&#xD;
"What do you mean by thet, Sir ?" cried&#xD;
Barnaby, with spirit.&#xD;
I We'll fix this little matter right away," said&#xD;
the Captain, deliberately. Then to the private :&#xD;
"piek, what are you about? Are you trying&#xD;
to put out your eyes?"&#xD;
"Tryin' to get the yolks o' eggs out of 'em,"&#xD;
responded Dick. "le smashed 'em right into&#xD;
my peepers."&#xD;
"Never mind your eyes, my man. I want to&#xD;
h'ist this deserter up here somewhere. Most&#xD;
any o' these trees'hl do."    ,    ,&#xD;
"Don't call me that'!" said Barnaby, brist-&#xD;
ling."     -&#xD;
"You game-man," continued the Captain,&#xD;
with'a'business air, "go and get him a barrel to&#xD;
stan' on, and a rope for him to hang on. We&#xD;
know how to do these. things in the Allerton&#xD;
Buishrangers."&#xD;
'. You're - makin' trouble for yerself!" .ob-&#xD;
served Barnaby, warningly. ".I never, writ my&#xD;
nameto no dockymint."       ..&#xD;
"But'you made your. mark, like this."&#xD;
The'Confederate held up before Barnaby's&#xD;
eyes the identical piece of paper on which Fe-&#xD;
lix.had written. Bhrnaby's name and mark illus-&#xD;
tratively.  'Having dropped it op the floor&#xD;
without further thought, the officer, on entering&#xD;
the house, had picked it up,.andwas considera-&#xD;
bWy surprised at finding the'.name of a young&#xD;
fellow who had enlisted in the company of&#xD;
which he was then a member, and deserted with-&#xD;
in twenty-four hours. He put the slip in his&#xD;
pocket, not thinking that he should-have occa-&#xD;
sion to refer to it so soon.   .-    -&#xD;
" Thet's very sing'lar !" said Barnaby, with&#xD;
a stare-of wonder. "I hev a twin brother o'&#xD;
thet name,. who left home 'bout two months ago,&#xD;
and has never been heerd of since."&#xD;
." If we've got so near to him as a twin broth-&#xD;
er, that's near enough !" was the consoling rer&#xD;
joinder. "Dick, stir yourself, and don't mind&#xD;
the omelet in your eyes."&#xD;
" I ken't see to fix things," said Dick, "but I&#xD;
ken hold him while you tend to it yourself.&#xD;
When I freezes to a covey, nothin' short, o'&#xD;
leath ken make me let go."&#xD;
The game-breeder grew pale, but Barnaby&#xD;
kept bis courage up.                  .&#xD;
Dick came and took hold of his collar with&#xD;
both hands, standing behind him. He of the&#xD;
shoulder straps slowly relinquished his grasp,&#xD;
and returned his pistol to its place, then turn-&#xD;
ing~fiercely to the fancier, said :&#xD;
"A rope and a barrel, you loitering rogue&#xD;
Be lively 1"&#xD;
The fancier went into his poultry-house, and&#xD;
soon re-appeq~red with the articles wanted. The&#xD;
Confederate snatched the rope from his hands,&#xD;
and telling him to bring along the barrel, hur-&#xD;
ried toward a large"o  with low limbs. IHav-&#xD;
ind selected a limb 'moat favorable to his dire&#xD;
purpose, he threw the rope over it, and exhib-"&#xD;
&#xD;
ited a dexterity which showed he was not use&#xD;
used to such a trade.&#xD;
' -CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
II WHICH BARNABY IS NOT HANGED.&#xD;
Most persons have a prejudice against being&#xD;
hanged by the neck till dead, and against being-&#xD;
hanged at all.  Barnaby Cruise represented&#xD;
this feeling pretty largely in his own individual-&#xD;
ity. He could see nothing agreeable in that&#xD;
mode of exit from this world, and le resolved&#xD;
not to go by that gate which has.certainly been&#xD;
rendered rather unpopular by numerous trav-&#xD;
elers. It was impossible for him to behold the&#xD;
movements of the officious man who answered&#xD;
to the title of Captain, with indifference.&#xD;
It happened, singularly enough, that this ac-&#xD;
tive officer did not disarm Barnaby of the wea-&#xD;
pon which hung at his side. Standing at the&#xD;
opposite side of his prisoner, with both hands&#xD;
employed, he entirely overlookedthe artillery-&#xD;
sword, and it is doubtful if he saw anything of&#xD;
Barnaby, below-his shoulders. The private who&#xD;
had'struggled with him with so much obstina-&#xD;
cy, having had an egg broken in each of his&#xD;
e es, was not in a condition to see very clearly,&#xD;
1 he Sandhiller was, in fact, a blur before Dick,&#xD;
as he stood grasping him with determined will.&#xD;
So the marvell that the captive's sword was not&#xD;
taken from him, was not so very great.&#xD;
Yonag Cruise, having no .intention of being&#xD;
hanged, mentally looked about him for hn&#xD;
surest, and easiest method of escape. The&#xD;
heavy instrument girt to his waist was a com.&#xD;
fort to him; anti be silently fixed upon it as&#xD;
the best mediator for his safety. He felt the&#xD;
athletic Rebel pinching his shoulders with pain-&#xD;
ful rigor ;-but that did not interfere with the&#xD;
use of his hands, although it crippled their free'&#xD;
action.. The means of extrication Barnaby&#xD;
now considered within his'reach.&#xD;
"Drop that thar barrel, you game.ebap !"&#xD;
cried the Captain,,".and; lead up Dick's horse.&#xD;
He come into the world on foot, and he shall go&#xD;
out on horseback."&#xD;
The fancier, who was rather reluctantly roll-&#xD;
ing a barrel to the tree, turned to obey this&#xD;
order.&#xD;
" Though born like a beggar, you shall dio&#xD;
like a prince" shouted the Captain to Barna-&#xD;
by, with a humor that the latter could not fully&#xD;
appreciate.&#xD;
Barnaby was not a weak youth. He had a&#xD;
great deal of muscular leverage on his bones ;&#xD;
they were not large muscles, but they were&#xD;
reliable. Life in the open air, athletic sports&#xD;
with. whites and blacks, had developed his&#xD;
strength and, hardened his frame. He was a&#xD;
wiry fellow. Some said that his legs and arms&#xD;
were too long for service; but the Sandhiller&#xD;
had. always found those members useful, and&#xD;
never in his way.&#xD;
Barnaby kept his wits active, watching for&#xD;

his 'fingers niore tightly for an instant, groan-&#xD;
ed, hoteid, related his-hold, and fell. Barnas&#xD;
by Wis' free, bit not done with offensive opera-&#xD;
tions.  The co'wardly cock trainer; was just&#xD;
ahead of him,.leading one of the horses to they&#xD;
Captain With which to give him a fitting start.&#xD;
for another state of existence. The Sandhiller&#xD;
ran after him nimbly, and smiting him upon&#xD;
the righit ear with the flat surface of his wea--&#xD;
pon, toppled 'hin dver, sprang over his body,&#xD;
and outflanking the Captain, took him in.the&#xD;
rear, an4 enjoyed the advantage .of a surprise.&#xD;
Without stopping for knightly  courtesies, he&#xD;
gave liiin a furious chop on the right shoulder,&#xD;
and the armn which was uplifted in adjusting the&#xD;
noose fell powerless to'his side.&#xD;
To speak'moderaftely, therewere at: least six.&#xD;
weeks of confinement inthat blow, and a crip-'&#xD;
pled member ever after., Staggerng a few&#xD;
paces in  bewildered cnsternation, he. finally&#xD;
brought tip   ainst the trunk of a tree. See-&#xD;
ing barneb,  and comprehending the cause of&#xD;
his ,sudden pain, 'le fumbled for his revolver&#xD;
with his left haud? and had preseneeof mind&#xD;
sufficient to draw and level it at his now dan-&#xD;
'garous enemy.&#xD;
" Drdp iti" road 'the Sandhiller, flourishing&#xD;
"ris reeking sword. "Drop it, or I'll hack' off&#xD;
t'ather ari!"&#xD;
This authoritative injunction was given a&#xD;
moment too late; a bullet passed through the&#xD;
Sun'dhiller's jacket while he was spealring, mk-&#xD;
ing a hot track along the skin. Exasperat d,&#xD;
Barnaby rushed upon his foe, and struck the&#xD;
revolver from his hand with a pitiless stroke.&#xD;
Three dissevered fingers fell to the earth with&#xD;
the pistol.&#xD;
"Quarter !" begged theCaptain, "quarter !"&#xD;
" I'l .quarter ye presently 1" said Blarnaby,&#xD;
"but don't be in a hurry about it."&#xD;
The' Confederate held up 'his- maimed and&#xD;
bleeding hand. 'The heart of the ruffians failed.&#xD;
A realization of what he had lost 'made him&#xD;
-sick and faint. His lawless spirit was met on&#xD;
the threshold of his reckless career, and driven&#xD;
backward by a terrible, life-lasting rebuke.&#xD;
"How would ye like' banging' yerself ?" added&#xD;
larnaby, pointing his weapon at the dangling'&#xD;
cord. "Elangin's as good for you as 'tis for me,&#xD;
isn't it?  Come,' Mister, what say to a dose o'&#xD;
yer'own doctorstuff "      ,&#xD;
" I cry quarter,' and I've got enough," an-&#xD;
sweted the Rebel" 'ficer, completely cowed.&#xD;
"I shall soon bleed to death."&#xD;
"I should soon 'o'hoke to death I" retorted&#xD;
Barnaby, with a glance atthe rope."'&#xD;
"A jest-'a mere:reat," tammered the Cons&#xD;
ederate '&#xD;
&#xD;
" Then thet is, a jest ?" said Burnaby-" and&#xD;
thet is a .jest!' lie, pointed to 'the' wounded&#xD;
shoulder and the sabred fingers. 4These yer&#xD;
are jests, certingly. A jolly thing is war, Rebe&#xD;
ble  Belly things ,is ropes and swords, pistils&#xD;
and :gunboats 1, Ther' wer' never. nothing , so&#xD;
lively as battles and squirmishes. And think.&#xD;
of the wooding ,legs, and the- cork hands with&#xD;
prongs to 'eml"&#xD;
The Captain scowled, and looked sadly at his&#xD;
stumps, from which the red sap was trickling.&#xD;
"I'd thank you, Sandhiller," said the Con-&#xD;
fedgrate, in a humble .tone; " to take a handker.&#xD;
chief from my pocket and bind up this.shat.&#xD;
tered hand, and to do the same for this slashed&#xD;
shoulder. Pm losing.too much blood. After.&#xD;
you've done these friendly offices, give me a lift&#xD;
to the back of my horse, and sometime I'll Jo&#xD;
,as much for you."&#xD;
",Call your Dick,.kladCapting, and look out'&#xD;
for yerself !" replied Barnaby. "As for yer&#xD;
animiles, I have. uses for 'em myself, and so Ilt&#xD;
horror 'em till we meet' again,.which won't be&#xD;
soon ; for it's my,'pinion that your fighting'&#xD;
days 'is over,,and you'll, start no more to the&#xD;
cry o' 'boots and saddles'."&#xD;
Barnaby took; the horse, which,was, standing&#xD;
quietly beneath the rope, by the bridle,. and&#xD;
vaulting into the saddle, rode bask to the epot&#xD;
where he bad stricken down the gaine-breeder.&#xD;
He - found that worthy ".wite trash" seated&#xD;
upon Mother Earth, feeling carefully the.side&#xD;
of his head, in a laudable endeavor to learn the&#xD;
extent of his .injuries.&#xD;
2" How do ye like thet, you white-feathered&#xD;
barnyard crower ?" queried Barnaby, leering at&#xD;
the fellow triumphantly. " Git up, you Chitta-&#xD;
gong,.and lead that hoss yer and give me the&#xD;
bridle."&#xD;
The trainer arose sulkily, and did as he was&#xD;
ordered.&#xD;
" You're a Guinea-hen1" said Barnaby, as he&#xD;
took the bridle-reinfrom the unwilling hand of&#xD;
the fancier. " All you're good for is tolollop&#xD;
about and make a great'noise. It's a good plan&#xD;
to hev ye out yer in the woods, out o' sight and,&#xD;
hearin'. How's my ole frien'?'&#xD;
The question related to Dick, Whom 'he found&#xD;
still stretched upon the ground, groaning and&#xD;
scooping' at his eyes, which were inflamed and'&#xD;
swollen. His side was bleeding.&#xD;
"Go ?long, you runnygade !" was 'the feeble&#xD;
response of Dick.&#xD;
" When ye git well," added. Barnaby, consid-&#xD;
erately, " report herself to headquarters, You'll&#xD;
find your Capting mighty handy with the tools&#xD;
in futur'. He won't be in the way o' hangin'&#xD;
his neighbors as.much as he wer'. He's 1ws. do&#xD;

" Obleege me, Sir, by handing' out thet yer&#xD;
spangled cock." If ye believe it, I've took a&#xD;
sudden fae to that crower."&#xD;
"I asw'r I won't I" protested the breeder, re-&#xD;
helliouiisl.&#xD;
Barnaby dragged out his smutehed sword,&#xD;
and give the fancier an admonitory rap on the&#xD;
sconce.&#xD;
"1Goddlemity !" swore the trainer, wickedly ;&#xD;
and literally surrendered his feathered favorite&#xD;
at the point of the sword.  -&#xD;
Barnaby tucked the fowl under his arm, where&#xD;
it immediately crowed. The fancier was ready&#xD;
to tear his hair out with vexation ; he had won&#xD;
money on the bird, and expected to win more.&#xD;
"He crows like a bugle," quoth Barnaby.&#xD;
"My friend', I thenk ye kind."&#xD;
"~Swar to me," entreated the trainer, "thet&#xD;
you won't kill it. Ther' isn't sich another bird&#xD;
in the State. He's worth a hundred dollars if&#xD;
he's worth a cent. He'll stay, stranger, whar&#xD;
ye put him. You ken bet your pile on him,&#xD;
and win. No matter how big your pile is ; go&#xD;
in on the spangled cock."&#xD;
" I'll do it !" answered Barnaby, pleased with&#xD;
the enthusiasm of the fancier, and was moving&#xD;
off, when the man called after him :&#xD;
" Look yer, Mister ! wouldn't take one o' the&#xD;
chil'en or my ole woman, and leave the spangled&#xD;
coca, would ye ?"&#xD;
" This cock," replied Barnaby, with grotesque&#xD;
gravity, "is parst out o' my jurydietion. It's&#xD;
confis'icated to the Guvviment of Uncle Sam.&#xD;
Good-bye, trainer. Be a good Smeritan, and&#xD;
pour ile, and wine, and other fluids into the cuts,&#xD;
bruises, and contoosions o' the wounded."&#xD;
With these benevolent recommendations, the&#xD;
Sandhiller rode away with the spangled cock&#xD;
under one arm, and the bridle-rein of the led&#xD;
horse over the other.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
THE GUIDE.&#xD;
Felix, having become weary of watching- and&#xD;
waiting, fell asleep.&#xD;
Passing into this peaceful condition, he escape -&#xD;
ed, for the time being, all his difficulties. It&#xD;
must here be written of him that he slumbered&#xD;
so unconsciously that he did not even dream of&#xD;
Anna, which fact is against all romantic pre-&#xD;
cedent. After swaying from side to side a&#xD;
while, he finally found a resting-place against a&#xD;
dry limb, and slept as profoundly as a frog at&#xD;
the bottom of a Well in the winter of the year.&#xD;
He was awakened from this blessed state by the&#xD;
shrill crowing of a cock, which, in the first&#xD;
flurry of consciousness, he mistook for the roar-&#xD;
ing of a lion. Starting to his feet with the un-&#xD;
certain movements of a drunken man, he looked&#xD;
about for the disturber of his repose. There&#xD;
was a vagueness of time and place on his mind,&#xD;
and the first glimpse of the trees was strange;&#xD;
but a moment of thought put him right.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Right about face !" said a Voice. And, tart&#xD;
ing completely round, li beheld Barnaby-&#xD;
mounted on a fine horse, with another in hand,&#xD;
and a spangled cock perched upon his arm,&#xD;
bristling Aid scraping its wing against its leg,.&#xD;
The Sandhiller looked sublime iii his compla-&#xD;
cency. Felix could do nothing more than won-&#xD;
der, for a space, at the sight before him. When.&#xD;
his surprise had abated, he asked :&#xD;
"XWell, Barnaby, what luck ?"&#xD;
"Tollable," said Barnaby, benignantly:&#xD;
" Are these the horses?   Whe'e is the-&#xD;
guide ?".                      er   ste-&#xD;
" These is the bosses, you see, and I am the-&#xD;
guide of 'emI" answered Barnaby, with that su-&#xD;
perb nonchalance which he could sometimes&#xD;
successfully assume.&#xD;
Felix readily perceived that there was some-&#xD;
thing mysterious in all this, and observed,&#xD;
yawning, and re seating himself on the log:&#xD;
"You have a story to tell, no doubt,; but.&#xD;
judging by your looks I don't think there is-&#xD;
time to tell it at present."'&#xD;
" I've lied one o' the most sing'lar experienx&#xD;
thet perobably ever happened in this part o'&#xD;
the kentry ! And, pe'r'aps," added he, drop-&#xD;
ping his voice meditatively, " it's equil k en't be&#xD;
foun' nowher'. Bit Qf these," he observed, in&#xD;
the same tone, after another pause, "we won't&#xD;
speak till everything is according. These isn't&#xD;
the animiles- or as some says, camomilese-&#xD;
which we was induced to suspect to heear-&#xD;
rove."p                             evr-&#xD;
"I believe I can understand part of that,"&#xD;
replied Felix, tartly.&#xD;
"Speaks well for your intellijunks !" said the&#xD;
Sandhiller, with a commendatory nod. " Hevn't-&#xD;
ye seen nothin' of 'em? I allow you hevn't,&#xD;
though, for darned if'ever I seen anybody sleep&#xD;
so like a dead man, as you was sleeping , when I&#xD;
come up. If it hedn't been for this grower,&#xD;
which I've confisticated and named Abe Lin-&#xD;
kum, I don't think I should hey got any sense&#xD;
into ye. I shouted three times severially a&#xD;
the tops o' my lungs, when this yer bird flop-&#xD;
lied his wings and sounded his horn. Lord IiP.&#xD;
wer' like the eraek of a rifle, only penetratinger&#xD;
to the drums o' the ears."&#xD;
Barnaby balanced the spangled cock on his,&#xD;
finger, and he really looked magnificent in his&#xD;
pride and plumage.&#xD;
" There's a Abe Linkum for ye !" quoth the:&#xD;
Sandhiller. " What do ye think Mrs. Linku&#xD;
and the little Linkurn's would say to him? I&#xD;
wonder Father Ab'ram hedn't taken to cock-&#xD;
fightin' instead o' rail-splittin'. It's a light and&#xD;
putty business. Orders fr m the entry exe-&#xD;
outed with neatness and dispatch. Onexbes&#xD;
wagers and the t'other wedges. Thet's the dif-&#xD;
ference atween the President and I. But I shall&#xD;
bring no railing' excavation agia him.  The.&#xD;
Bible says, rail not at gov'ners, 'cause you duo&#xD;
no how soon you mayn be a go'ner yerdlf."&#xD;

ments longer."                                The youth smiled; and Felix, who had die.&#xD;
"'Bout: five ci'clock by my time, which is the covered the blunder of which he had been the&#xD;
sun," said Barnaby, dismounting, setting his victim, reddened, and bestowed upon his quaint&#xD;
feathered prize upon the log, and talking to follower a squelching look. He addressedhim-&#xD;
him in a most confidential manner. In the in- seif to the lad, saying :&#xD;
-terval of waiting, he busied himself in twisting  "You are probably the person spoken of by&#xD;
a string of bark, to secure his gay captive Miss Conway."eo                    e&#xD;
against sudden flight.  Having knotted this   "Under the name and style of Andrew," said&#xD;
around Abe's leg, and keeping the other end in Barnaby, pushing himself into the conver-&#xD;
his hand, he felt relieved of apprehension, and sation.&#xD;
held himself in readiness to relate the greatest  "I am that Andrew referred to by my cousin&#xD;
adventure of his whole life. As he was about Anna," answered the youth, with some embar-&#xD;
to launch upon this prolific subject, two per- rassment.&#xD;
sons were discovered approaching, whom they   " And a good deal hacked and slashed, at&#xD;

-"Oh yes," laughed Felix; "lie was born&#xD;
among the chivalry ; on the, very borders of&#xD;
your father's'plantation perhaps."&#xD;
' My peril o' honor-won't hold much longer,"&#xD;
aid Barnaby, shaking his head. "I ken feel it,&#xD;
givin' way. There'll be the devil to paywhen'&#xD;
it breaks."&#xD;
'' the Sandhiller shifted the spangled conicto&#xD;
14 other arm, and scowled at the youthful Ain-&#xD;
drew, who rode on unconcernedly, following a&#xD;
s-gyowi track that wound to, the right and,&#xD;
among the trees.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
BARNABY'd'"GnEAT rIGHT.&#xD;
ITleir progress was necessarily slow, as the&#xD;
srowness of. the path aid the natural obstruc-,&#xD;
Bo is zof ,tile way did not - admit of speed.&#xD;
&amp;amp; ndrew,.who had at first taken the lead, grade--&#xD;
dy ell- back'till Old Sut was finally in ad-&#xD;
ece.  The youth spoke .a few word, to him&#xD;
in a ldi tone as lie passed; to which the black&#xD;
repliedd "Yes, Mars'r," -and afterward seemed,&#xD;
duly .installed, as guide. When the width of&#xD;
the ,way permitted it, Andrew reined up his&#xD;
horse,'and rode at the bridle-hand of Felix, who&#xD;
bad iot that relish for his society that he should&#xD;
have had' for Miss donway's relative. It did&#xD;
appear to the Federal agent that the latter took&#xD;
special pains to thrust his company upon him,&#xD;
even after he had ,given him unmistakable&#xD;
signsof disapprobation.  Felix did not like&#xD;
draw) and lisp,,and this'conceited cousin now&#xD;
anethen fell into that fashion&#xD;
TO write a plain matter of human nature, .it&#xD;
must be said that Westerly thought more of&#xD;
Anna than of the situation. He seriously&#xD;
doubted whether lie had not committed a grave&#xD;
error, in yielding to her wishes, and leaving her&#xD;
Mt the house. He had understood her to say&#xD;
that her safety was provided for; and he had&#xD;
by some means received the impression, that&#xD;
ahe would join the party at some point on the&#xD;
way, or at the place of destination. It is proba-&#xD;
ble that the hope that this would be the case,&#xD;
produced the conviction. Lovers are prone to&#xD;
expect ,what they desire. He had a feeling of&#xD;
4sanisfaetion that he could neither overcome&#xD;
or, disguise. Without knowing it, he was&#xD;
really very poor .company, inclined to tacitur-&#xD;
nity and to crusty answers.&#xD;
'Old Sut said but little ; but it was observable&#xD;
thathe treated the wounded youth with marked&#xD;
respect, turning often to look at him. Several&#xD;
times. he was seen to shrug his shoulders, and&#xD;
indulge in quiet humor, but his deportment gen-&#xD;
erally was grave and attentive&#xD;
It was past six o'clock, and shadows began&#xD;
to deepen in the forest. Thus far the ride had&#xD;
been characterized by neither haste nor appar-&#xD;
sot anxiety on the part of those who had as-&#xD;
Samel.d the responsibility of the undertaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
1'I&#xD;
&#xD;
The Sandhiller was the most unconcerned of&#xD;
the four. There was but one thing that an-&#xD;
noyed him, and that was, being kept from tell-&#xD;
ing, his late exploits.  By' and by, Andrew&#xD;
Jkindly relieved him of this vexation, by asking&#xD;
him to inform them how he procured the horses,&#xD;
as Old' Sut had settled the question of the legiti-&#xD;
mate ownership.  While Barnaby was clear-&#xD;
ing his throat for this agreeable task, Felix ob-&#xD;
served:&#xD;
It seem-,quite lonely here. Are you sure&#xD;
we are not running, into danger?"&#xD;
He 'looked 'at Old Stit, scorning the opinion of&#xD;
Andrew.&#xD;
" Hard to tell, Mars'r"!" answered the black.&#xD;
"Nobody dunino when there ain't no danger in&#xD;
this yer kentry, where there 's nothin' but wars&#xD;
and 'sturbinces."&#xD;
"Thet'll do !" said Barnaby ; "speak short&#xD;
when. you're ^poke to. Thet last rymark wer'&#xD;
long enough for a white man. The hour is now&#xD;
quiet, and I hope you'll take pattern arter&#xD;
Natur', while I gretify Master Andrew 'bout&#xD;
this adventur', which is better nor a novel, for&#xD;
the reason thet it hes the benefit o' being' true.&#xD;
My way is, when I've got'a story to tell, to go&#xD;
right at it, and tell it simple 'and jest as it hap-&#xD;
pened, without addin' nor. takin' away nor the&#xD;
use o' scperfluvious words."&#xD;
"'Brevity is-the soul of wit', somebody has&#xD;
said," remarked Andrew,&#xD;
"Thet person ver' no fool," replied Barnaby,&#xD;
patronizingly. "Should you chance to meet&#xD;
thet man or any o' his'fam'ly, give 'em my love,&#xD;
and tell him I'm travelin' thet road. If a chap&#xD;
keu't say what he's got to say 'thout going' to&#xD;
the dickshenary, he'd better hold his tongue.&#xD;
If you'll be good enough to kerry this cock,&#xD;
young feller. -I ken git to the marrer o' the&#xD;
story 'sider'bly quicker, as I want to use both&#xD;
han's for the g-stur's in the rumphatie parts."&#xD;
" Carry your own cock, Sandhiller, and get&#xD;
at your story as soon as convenient. I do not&#xD;
.want my ears bored by an exordium," respond-&#xD;
ed Andrew.&#xD;
" -dunno a exo'dium from a rat-trap 1" said&#xD;
Barnaby. " But-here goes. I was born of poor&#xD;
but clean perrents."&#xD;
"Is there any need of beginning back so far ?"&#xD;
inquired Andrew.&#xD;
Perceiving, that Anna's cousmn was alarmed&#xD;
at this commencement, Felix did not interfere,&#xD;
maliciously hoping the Sandhiller would be- as&#xD;
provoking as possible, and gave him an en-&#xD;
couraging wiik.&#xD;
"My mother was a dipper and my father was&#xD;
a clipper.. My mother dipped siuff with a&#xD;
swabstick chawed at the end, and my father&#xD;
clipped cocks and horses with a' pair o' shears.&#xD;
I should been a only son if I hedn't hed broth-&#xD;

&#xD;
BARNABY, TIE SANDHILLER.&#xD;
&#xD;
with fixed bagonets"-this was a little obscure&#xD;
in Barnaby--" five or six others flew round and&#xD;
got "a rope and tied it to the ridge-pole of a&#xD;
tree, and led a powerful big hoss under it. Not&#xD;
this ene," said Barnaby, ingenuously, "but&#xD;
-one as this is a sucking colt alongside of."&#xD;
"I'm unworthy to have such an attendant!"&#xD;
-exclaimed Westerly.&#xD;
rle-spangled cock having wiped his beak on&#xD;
the horse's ear, erected his body and neck, and&#xD;
treated all within the sound of his voice to his&#xD;
best quality of crow. Abe had never done any-&#xD;
-thing sharper in that line.&#xD;
" Ioramity! We're within a mile o' the&#xD;
Confederate pickets!" cried Sut, in perceptible&#xD;
'trepidation.&#xD;
" It happened-I kent 'count for it-thet&#xD;
none of 'em seed my sword, which hung to my&#xD;
-side all through the tussle, but we was so near&#xD;
together thet it couldn't flop about much, and&#xD;
so in the excitement probably wer'n't noticed&#xD;
This is the only view I ken take on't. Nobody&#xD;

'everythin' we, ready, I whipped out my cleaver&#xD;

Tolled about like ninepin balls."&#xD;
"Who can doubt it?" murmured Felix.&#xD;
"The proof of the puddin' is in the eatin'&#xD;

incredulity. " They pressed me mighty hard&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
THE CROWER CRoWS THEM INTO TROUBLE.&#xD;
Pets are troublesome comforts, as a general&#xD;
thing. No schoolboy ever had a  iiseievous&#xD;
crow, and no young miss a lame robin, which&#xD;
did not in some way involve their owners in&#xD;
embarrassments and difficulties. Pets, feaner-&#xD;
ed or furred, are unreasoning creatures, and&#xD;
cannot be taught discretion. The spangled&#xD;
cock was not an exception to this prevailing&#xD;
peculiarity, and soon invoked danger upon the&#xD;
heads of its protectors. Seeing a large bird&#xD;
flying very low, Abe immediately challenged&#xD;
that bird to instant and mortal combat.. Nor&#xD;
was Abe content with one shrill note of defiance;&#xD;
he scraped his leg, shook his wings, and crow-&#xD;
ed at least seven times. Old Sut was thrown&#xD;
into a fever of apprehension. .lHe stopped his&#xD;
&#xD;
horse, and protested against farther demonstra*&#xD;
tions of this kind, with the most moving African&#xD;
eloquence. le begged larnaby to cut off Abe's&#xD;
head without delay, or, at least, to tie a rope-&#xD;
yarn around it's neck.&#xD;
"Nigger!" said Barnaby, much shocked at&#xD;
these vile suggestions, "I'd sooner snip off your&#xD;
head nor his'n The fact is," he went on, em-&#xD;
phatically, "you weren't brought from a dis-&#xD;
tance as this bird wer', but are indigammonus&#xD;
to the sile. You never wer' put aboard ais ear-&#xD;
b'iler, nigger, with a sailor-feller to give ye a&#xD;
dime's worth of corn per dierum, aid fetched&#xD;
acrost the trackless brine. Black man, you&#xD;
never seen no brine, 'cept the pickle that they&#xD;
slash onto you arter a wallopin'. Think how&#xD;
long this animile stood tied by the leg on the&#xD;
poop-gunnel o' the vessel, with his hackles wet&#xD;
with the awash o' the ocean. But you, darkey,&#xD;
hev hed nothin' but plain sailin' from the era-&#xD;
dIe till now, without no extry cost for imputa-&#xD;
tion, clippin', or trainin'; and ther's plenty&#xD;
more on ye o' the same sort. Go away, orI&#xD;
swar by bloo clay and by yellow snuff, thet 'll&#xD;
sarve you as you want to sarve this feathered-&#xD;
wobbler."&#xD;
Barnaby drew out six inches of his eleavir,&#xD;
and let it slide back again with a clash.&#xD;
Twilight had set in, but it was still light&#xD;
enough to see quite clearly. The Sandhillee's&#xD;
last action drew the attention of the negro mere&#xD;
particularly toward that formidable weap osi&#xD;
which swung at the side of the youthful Boan-&#xD;
erges.&#xD;
Riding close to Barnaby, and depressing his&#xD;
woolly pate, he saw a small mark on the scab-&#xD;
bard of the artillery-sword. His manner in-&#xD;
staitly changed, ard expressed both wonder&#xD;
ard consternation.b 1  Stared so long at the&#xD;
sword, that Barnaby noticed the circumstance&#xD;
and the transition from one mood to another.&#xD;
"Shake not your gory locks at me I" quoth&#xD;
Barnaby, falling back uponetragedy, and ending&#xD;
with  " What's bust ?"&#xD;
1 Mars'r Barnaby," responded Sut, in a trem-&#xD;
ulous tone, 1 whar, in the name of de Lor', did&#xD;
ye git that yar '"&#xD;
Ie pointed at the weapon with a faltering&#xD;
finger.&#xD;
The Sandhiller, suspecting that the black had&#xD;
some strategy in view perilous to Abe, shielded&#xD;
that gaudy pugilist with his left arm, and&#xD;
saidl:&#xD;
"No gammon, darkey !"&#xD;
" Mars'r Cruise, tell me whar?"&#xD;
Thee was something so earnest in this ap-&#xD;
peal, that Baniaby did not attempt to ignore it,&#xD;
but remembering the way in which thesword&#xD;
tid come into his possession, began to mistrust&#xD;
that there might be some reason for the slave's&#xD;
agitation. Bending toward Old Sut, lie answer.&#xD;
ed, in a cautious voice :&#xD;
I found it wiser' other' was meny sloh I"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Then all is lost!" groaned the negro, tern-&#xD;
bly downcast.       "-                    a&#xD;
"Not so bad as thet," said Barnaby ; Itbut I&#xD;
reekin you stan' on slippery places, with trap-&#xD;
doors aneath your feet and hemp atop."S&#xD;
" Who betrayed vs ?" demanded Old Sut,&#xD;
with a startling look at Barnaby.  D&#xD;
"Be kerful t" warned the latter.  "Don't&#xD;
murder nobody till ye know you're hurt."&#xD;
He slackened his horse a little, and muttered e&#xD;
to himself:&#xD;
" What a free old devil it are!. Ther's &#xD;
throat-cuttia' in that nig."d "aedte&#xD;
"Nobody iesn't betrayed ye," added the i&#xD;
Sandhiller, raising his voice. "Your horribul&#xD;
secret is safe enoughh so fur as thet goes. But I&#xD;
'vise you, as a fnien', to guy it up. With wan's&#xD;
and fighting's, buruiu's and plundenin's, shoot's&#xD;
and hangminns, the entry is bad 'nough off&#xD;
'thout slave instigations."&#xD;
Abe wound his bugle obstreperously. It is&#xD;
doubtful if the incognito king of Lincoln-green&#xD;
memory blew his hunting horn so loudly after&#xD;
his combat, with Roderic Dhu.&#xD;
"Blast that bird !" cried Felix, completely&#xD;
out of patience.*"&#xD;
" That makes twice," said Andrew, "that you&#xD;
have objurgated that fowl, and I must inform&#xD;
you that profanity is particularly vulgar and&#xD;
Felix mumbled something else that sounded&#xD;
marvelously like the first profanity prolonged.&#xD;
" If Miss Anna,"' added Andrew, "should&#xD;
hear you go on in that frightful manner, she&#xD;
neve' would forgive you.rn&#xD;
"Oh, there's no swearing in Sautbern so-4&#xD;
ciety !" sneered Felix. ",Miss Conway has&#xD;
more sense tian-than some otherpersons."&#xD;
" I see how it is with ou," replied Andrew,&#xD;
with condescension. "You have fallen in love&#xD;
with my cousin, and I am likely to have a&#xD;
Yankee kinsman; a thing which I tell you&#xD;
frankly won't set well on my Southern pride."&#xD;
" Were you of an age and stature to meet me&#xD;
on equal terms, I would soon settle that matter&#xD;
with you, and give you something, perchance,&#xD;
that would agree still less with your fastidious&#xD;
notions I" retorted Felix, frowning.&#xD;
"Let us delay our quarrel for the present,"&#xD;
laughed Andrew. " I'll throw down the glove&#xD;
to you soon enough, I'll warrant.".'&#xD;
Westerly looked at his new traveling com.&#xD;
rade, and marveled that a young fellow with so&#xD;
much impertinence should have so much good&#xD;
humor. That laughing mouth did really look&#xD;
like Anna's, and he could not help secretly own-&#xD;
ing it. He prudently forbore to press the alter-&#xD;
cation further.&#xD;
" Hair "'exclaimed the youth, stopping his&#xD;
horse. " I hear the sound of feet."&#xD;
There followed a sudden halt and a dead si-&#xD;
lence. The spangled cock improved that silence&#xD;
with a vigorousness that added to the enormity&#xD;
&#xD;
f his other offences. Westerly made a snatch'&#xD;
t its neck, but Barnaby protected his favorite.&#xD;
Not a suspicious sound could be heard.&#xD;
Barnaby watched for an opportunity, and&#xD;
whispered to Felix:&#xD;
SSpeak a consolatin' word to thet nigger&#xD;
when ye git a chance, for he's woundedly cut.&#xD;
up 'bout them yer arms in Chloe's sullar. By'&#xD;
ome mark or t'other he's rescognized this-&#xD;
hopper."&#xD;
"On account of the faithful Chloe, I will put-&#xD;
's mind at ease."&#xD;
Felix was going to execute this benevolent in-&#xD;
tention, when there broke abruptly upon their&#xD;
ears the clatter of horses' hoofs. .&#xD;
"Whoever comes," muttered Westerly, " have&#xD;
guided their movements by the crowings of that&#xD;
unlucky bird. They stopped to listen when we&#xD;
did and your confounded Abe has done the-&#xD;
business for us. 'Unless," he added, ironically,&#xD;
glancing at Andrew, " this good youth has some&#xD;
talisman to avert danger.&#xD;
"Dippers and clippers !" exclaimed Barnaby.&#xD;
" Don't lean on this fellow, for he's turnin' pale&#xD;
already ; and if he's no better piluck nor that,.&#xD;
he'd better scamper away and save hisself."&#xD;
" Throw away your chicken !" said Felix,.&#xD;
" and draw your sword. If there are not too,&#xD;
many of them, we'll fight. Jt is yet li4ht&#xD;
enough to take tolerable aim, and I will use the&#xD;
gift of the generous Rebel to the best of my&#xD;
ability, should there be need. Old Sut, if you~&#xD;
have weapon of offense or defense, out with it&#xD;
and help us, and don't fret about your secret"&#xD;
At the first alarm, the negro rode to the side&#xD;
of Andrew with much determination of manner,&#xD;
and now answered :&#xD;
SI'searmed, Mars'r Felix, and I'll fight for&#xD;
Mars'r Andrew while thar's a breff o' life in my&#xD;
brack body."&#xD;
" For Mars'r Andrew 1" grumbled Barnaby.&#xD;
" I fights for the Capting, which are worth two-&#xD;
o' him."&#xD;
" Don't fight, Sut !" said Andrew, warningly.&#xD;
"You know it is death to raise your hand&#xD;
against a white man."&#xD;
" We mus' all die I" said the negro, impres-&#xD;
sively, and with a stern and lowering face.&#xD;
"Death comes to all, Mars-r ; and to a worn-out.&#xD;
slave what matter how soon I"&#xD;
Putting his hand into the breast of his coarse&#xD;
jean jacket, he drew out a small weapon ; it was&#xD;
a revolver of approved pattern and deadly ae-&#xD;
euracy. Andrew, following his example, pro-&#xD;
duced the counterpart of this instrument.&#xD;
"Face this way 1" ordered Felix. " They are'&#xD;
galloping down the path. Stand firm-here&#xD;
yCoronel Allerton " gasped Andrew, reeling&#xD;
in his saddle.&#xD;
"Thet p'ison, overseer 1" cried Barnaby. And&#xD;
immediately some pistol-shots rattled about.&#xD;
their ears, wounding the trees behind them.&#xD;

his bir], Slipping from the saddle, he began&#xD;
to look for Abe. - While thus employed, lie&#xD;
heard the mutterings of thunder, and perceived&#xD;
that dark masses of clouds were drifting rapidly&#xD;
Grosbthe heaven. Not daring to linger long-&#xD;
er, he put his foot in the stirrup to mount,&#xD;
when be discovered the spangled cook sitting&#xD;
quietly upon the crupper, where it had been all&#xD;
the while, having ridden away and back again,&#xD;
unobserved by its new owner. The latter made&#xD;
same expressions of astonishment not compli-&#xD;
meptary to his own sharpness, and took a see-&#xD;
god start in pursuit of his friends.&#xD;
It grew darkrapidly,,and it was with dificul-&#xD;
tv that he could keep the .path. The lightning,&#xD;
whici appeared at first low down upon the hori-&#xD;
zon, now dashed. across the' zenith with start-&#xD;
ling effect. Barnaby was somewhat awed ; but&#xD;
Abe, not 'having the fear of the elements before&#xD;
his eyes, crowed the most fiercely when it thun-&#xD;
dered the loudest. The Sandhiller patted him&#xD;
on the head in token of approbation. After&#xD;
clattering ca a long time, he became apprehen-&#xD;
sive that he bad lost the way ; but, by-and-by,&#xD;
was relieved of his anxiety by hearing Wester-&#xD;
ly call out:&#xD;
4 Is that you, Barnaby ?"&#xD;
To which he gave the proper response ; when&#xD;
Felix reproached him for his absence, which&#xD;
had caused them much uneasiness, not knowing&#xD;
but some accident had happened to him,&#xD;
Barnaby answered to the effect, that he had&#xD;
been detained by the wounded overseer, by&#xD;
whom revelations of the most astounding char-&#xD;
acter had been made, which could not be wrung&#xD;
from him by any amount of pressure that could&#xD;
be applied, morally or physically.&#xD;
" One queer thing I don't min' tellin' you,"&#xD;
he was good enough to add. "II lost Abe, and&#xD;
went back for him, wien he wer' all the while&#xD;
sittin' ahind me on the crupper. Durned if it&#xD;
wasn't a joke I".      .&#xD;
Old Sit was mightily pleased,,and chuckled&#xD;
at this absurdity ; and though it provoked a&#xD;
smile from Westerly, he was too anxious for&#xD;
shelter and food to give it much attention. An-&#xD;
drew was the subject of similar feelings, and&#xD;
when the lightning revealed his features,/they&#xD;
were very pale, and wore a troubled expression.&#xD;
He said :'&#xD;
"You have detained us, Barnaby. Go on,&#xD;
Sut. You know where to go, and be sure and&#xD;
'take the shortest way."&#xD;
The voice was slightly tremulous, and made&#xD;
Felix.think of Anna.&#xD;
The parties had halted to wait for lBarnaby,&#xD;
but they now moved forward with alacrity, each&#xD;
secretly quailing at the impending -storm.&#xD;
Large drops of rain began tofall; -they pattered&#xD;
on the leaves like bullets. The horses, which&#xD;
shrank and trembled at the lightning, increased&#xD;
their;speed of their/ -own volition. 'The dumb'&#xD;
aseauressented -to know the way, and though'&#xD;
&#xD;
the night had slhut in as l),ck as ink, -ept the&#xD;
bridle-path  vitih wonderful instinct. No one&#xD;
felt disposed to convers uion. The watery drops&#xD;
came faster and faster, till they beat upon the&#xD;
riders in torrents.&#xD;
Andrew rode close to Felix, while Burnaby&#xD;
cantered behind.  In the course of half an&#xD;
hour, their almost invisible guide halted, and&#xD;
Westerly could see something looming before&#xD;
them that be took to be a dwelling. The sight&#xD;
gladdened him, for fasting and exercise ha*d&#xD;
tasked him -severely. His recent wounds ap.&#xD;
peared to be opening again, and ie experience&#xD;
pains in his flesh, and dull aches in his bones.&#xD;
He was drenching wet.&#xD;
" Here we are, Mars'r Andrew !" cried Sut,&#xD;
cheerily, 4 Get off, Mars'r Westerly, and wall&#xD;
right in. I know whar we be now.     Some&#xD;
Unioners psed -to live here, which was drove of&#xD;
by the 'Federates, leavim' only a few servants&#xD;
and some women-folks."&#xD;
The black assisted Andrew to dismount, or&#xD;
more properly, literally listed him from  the&#xD;
horse, and set him upon the threshold. Wes-&#xD;
terly, ever suspicious, thought Old Sut whis-&#xD;
pered to him during this action. The negro&#xD;
having previously opened the door, they entered&#xD;
a dark hall, while the former fumbled about&#xD;
and rang a bell. By-and-by, a colored boy ap-&#xD;
peared with a light, who conducted them to an&#xD;
ante-room.&#xD;
"Make yourself perfectly at home, Mr. Wes-&#xD;
terly, for the owner of this establishment is a&#xD;
near relative. I will go and look up my ang&#xD;
wheni you shall have proper attention,' sai&#xD;
Andrew, making a motion to Sut, who followed&#xD;
him from the apartment.&#xD;
Felix sank wearily to a seat, and abandoning&#xD;
hims4lf to the luxury of rest, was almost asleep&#xD;
when a mulatto woman came to show him to a&#xD;
more comfortable quarters. He was ld to a&#xD;
chamber, which, tired as he was, surprised him&#xD;
by the elegance of its appointments. Although&#xD;
it was notcold, a fire, just kindled, was blazing&#xD;
in a grate. A negro man stood waiting ohs&#xD;
quiously with dressing-gown and slippers,&#xD;
while another presented on a tray a steaming&#xD;
brandy-punch, which he seized and drank with&#xD;
an avidity that made his sable waiters wigk.&#xD;
Yery soon suitable food was placed before him,&#xD;
of which he prudently ate sparingly, and retired&#xD;
to bed with a willingness Induced by extraordi-&#xD;
pary fatigue. His dreams were mostly of Di-&#xD;
ana, Anna, and Andrew, who,svangely enough,&#xD;
took the lion's share of his nocturnal fancies.&#xD;

"Since pal ting with you, my dear young&#xD;

" You, are beginnitrg td' catch the trick of&#xD;

biau to relate the incidents of your flight."&#xD;
" I beg you'to defer your purpose, Miss Con-&#xD;

Miss Anna pat her handkerchief to her lips.&#xD;
" What have you to say of lily Cousin A n.&#xD;
drew ?" she, asked, becoming demure of a sud.&#xD;
den.&#xD;
Felix hesitated, not caring to express lii&#xD;
views of that-youth very freely.&#xD;
" Do-not tuinee'nmxtters, Mr. Westerly I" she&#xD;
added  11IfVou do  .t like him' do not feat&#xD;
that the anuuicerient will'disturi me.'I't&#xD;
adare of his peeuliaities.'1&#xD;
" Being a relative of yours, and acting under&#xD;
you'r orders for imy personal safety, it would&#xD;
evince bad'taste in the to speak ill of hia; asi&#xD;
yet I eathiot say that he was altogether to' my&#xD;
mind. At times he was slightly flippant; a&#xD;
refetred in a disrespectful inanne to one Whose&#xD;
nhue tust ever be held'id the highest te'era&#xD;

Felix dropped' his eyes tillthey tested on the&#xD;
tip of a dainty -slipper. He made a slight ih.&#xD;
elluation of iS body toWard Anna.&#xD;
"He is seamewhat of a eo±oorulb, and' h&#xD;
slight reverence for Cousin Anna. I hope hi&#xD;
said nothing calculated to injure ine in youth e-&#xD;
timation ?" she remarked, naively.&#xD;
" Unburden your midd of that possibility ;&#xD;

you aete powerfully than Words, aid hig iilper-&#xD;

He attempted to take her hard; she *ith-&#xD;

" I feza' you must have soniewbat misappre-&#xD;

" Do'not thus flatter yourself, Miss ConwayI;&#xD;
he returned ; " for I assure you, had he not&#xD;
6een both youth relative and agent, I should&#xD;
have chastised him on the spot. Anna,;' he add-&#xD;
ed, with a sudden change Of tone, "youk have&#xD;

" If you are going to -be serious, I will Cali&#xD;

"Speak' not that trufier's name I' eclairhed&#xD;
Felix, with emotion. "To you and to me he is&#xD;

In the heat and agitation of a moment so fraught  " How can a woman tell what she might,&#xD;
with consequences, it was impossible for him to have said ten minutes ago, or what she will&#xD;
study the meaning of .the soft-voiced siren. in say in ten minutes to come ?" she. retorted,,&#xD;
the i'apid changes of her expression.      with composure, yet looking at him askance.&#xD;
"Hear me for the last time !" cried Felix,  "It is useless to protract this scene," said.&#xD;
passionately.                              Felix, coldly. "It is an idle chase after&#xD;

She disengaged her hand very gently;, lie  " I begin to breathe again !" murmured Felix.&#xD;
could have kept it without much effort.      " You never stopped breathing !" retorted'&#xD;
Westerly sat down in a dubious state of mind, Anna.  "Although I've seen you when I&#xD;

using me simply for your amusement."       kissed her hands.&#xD;
The handkerchief left her eyes; and it was not,  .."Don't !" said Anna. "You run at con-&#xD;
so far as Felix could discover, much saturated delusions. I am going to reject you."&#xD;
&#xD;
Felix flew up like an India-rubber ball.&#xD;
" You tare the No ti Star, you know, while I&#xD;
represent the South ern Cross. It will not do.,&#xD;
I fear that we must always sustain the same re.&#xD;
nation to each other that we now do. I must&#xD;
conquer this weakness."  ..&#xD;
"Then  you  acknowledge-"   interrupted&#xD;
Felix, impetuously.&#xD;
"I do!I" sighed Anna, interruptng Felix in&#xD;
her turn.&#xD;
At that, interesting crisis, the crowing of a&#xD;
cock made them both start with surprise; and&#xD;
looking.toward the door with flushed'faces, they&#xD;
saw Barnaby Cruise, with the spangled cock&#xD;
perched upon his finger.&#xD;
Annoyance, embarrassment, and vexation,&#xD;
rushed upon' Felix at once. Anna, more self-&#xD;
p ossessed, concealed her confusion by keeping&#xD;
er face from the intruder. That she felt an&#xD;
inclination to laugh, was certain. Felix, be-&#xD;
lieving himself so near the, goal, determined&#xD;
not to be pushed from it by all the Sandhillers&#xD;
in the world. Seizing her hand, as he stood&#xD;
partially behind her, looking over her shoulder:&#xD;
" Anna, say ' Yes' I"&#xD;
" I cannot !" she gasped. " I am married I"&#xD;
Felix let fall her hand, but did not stir.&#xD;
Wonderstruck and doubting, he waited to hear&#xD;
her speak again. Possibly this was play ful&#xD;
mockery, and her next words would give him&#xD;
joy. She did speak. She added, with flutter-&#xD;
ing breath, and in a voice strangely soft for so&#xD;
harsh an utterance :&#xD;
"One cannot be married twice. My husband&#xD;
lives."&#xD;
In some way she, slipped away from him ;&#xD;
she flitted from his sight like a phantom, and&#xD;
was gone, leaving him pale and faint, with ob&#xD;
jects reeling and swimming around hint.&#xD;
CIIAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
MAncU. ',&#xD;
"heartless ! cruel l" exclaimed Felix.&#xD;
" You look like death on a pale hoss !" said&#xD;
Barnaby.   "Cheer up t  Die game ! Don't&#xD;
show the white feather. You may win yet."&#xD;
" Too late, Barnaby," answered Felix, ab-&#xD;
stractedly.&#xD;
"Don't say thet. I've seen a bird whop up&#xD;
artery he'd been cut down, and whip his edver-&#xD;
sary."&#xD;
" The battle." skid Felix, trying to look brave,&#xD;
" is already won by another."&#xD;
"Do you r'al'y mean it?" asked Barnaby,&#xD;
tossing Abe out of the window. " Thet takes&#xD;
away my breath ; be hanged if it don't ! Didn't&#xD;
think sech wickedness wer' in her. If thet gel&#xD;
hesn't laid herself out to please ye, then I never&#xD;
see a gel lay herself out."&#xD;
The Sandhiller drew his artillery-sword, and&#xD;
drove the point into the floor with an energetic&#xD;
blow.&#xD;
"Tell me where' the man is," he went on,&#xD;
&#xD;
scowling moodily, "and I'll serve him like&#xD;
thet."&#xD;
The sword quivered in the wood, emitting a&#xD;
vibratory sound.&#xD;
Burnaby smote the pommel of it with the&#xD;
palm of his hand, and repeated:&#xD;
"Like thet!"&#xD;
The spangled cock, catching his inspiration,&#xD;
flew back, perched on the crosslet of the hilt,&#xD;
and crowed.&#xD;
" Jes' so !" quoth Barnabv. " Jes' so ! Thet's&#xD;
the spirit to ake this yer'kind o' thing with!&#xD;
Fight 'em, Abe-fight 'emm   Go in on your&#xD;
own heels or t'otherwise, with gaffs or without,'&#xD;
a-foot or a-horseback, rough and tumble. Who's&#xD;
afeard ? If ye git a bad throw in the pit, up&#xD;
and at 'em."&#xD;
There was a high moral bearing in this, in-&#xD;
tended entirely for Westerly's benefit.  The&#xD;
latter paced to and fro in a distracted manner&#xD;
The Sandhiller regarded him with the liveliest&#xD;
sympathy.&#xD;
" Not bagged, Capting ?"&#xD;
He asked this question with as much pathos&#xD;
as he could throw into his voice.&#xD;
"Married, Barnaby, married I" exlaimed Fe-&#xD;
lix, covering his face with his hands.&#xD;
' A chile four year old could kill me with the&#xD;
butt end of a hackle-feather !" persisted Barna-&#xD;
by, holding up both hands, and letting them&#xD;
fall heavily. " Clip my comb, if I ever learn&#xD;
the eqsiil o' this. I shall lose my mentual&#xD;
equal-alraham. If this is so,durned if ever I'll&#xD;
merry Tildy White! Here's the greenbacks,&#xD;
though"--lie touched his pocket -"and the&#xD;
scrip according . But who keers ? If we ken't&#xD;
hev Miss Annie, we don't want nothia'."&#xD;
He struck the sword again, and came netr&#xD;
hitting Abe on the head, who had much difficul-&#xD;
ty in keeping his narrow perch.&#xD;
" Not in the least !" he added, with emphasis.&#xD;
" Not by no means whatsomenever. A gel that&#xD;
would do thet are worse nor a interval."&#xD;
" Wish I'd been shot !" muttered Felix.&#xD;
" Been better for you," said Barnaby.&#xD;
Then, after a momentary thought, amended&#xD;
therernark with :&#xD;
" You'd a made money by bein' shot."&#xD;
There was a pause, which the Sandhiller was&#xD;
first to break.&#xD;
Ile walked up to Felix, tapped him on the&#xD;
shoulder, and said, meaningly :&#xD;
" You've lost sight o' one thing, my frien'!&#xD;
Didn't you rather lose sight o' the feet thet yot&#xD;
was more or less ferried yourself?"&#xD;
Westerly felt his hair bristling, and mumbled,&#xD;
irreverently, something that sounded like :&#xD;
" The deuce ! I swear to you, Barnaby, that&#xD;
I forget that infernal marriage every time I see&#xD;
that woman. She has put everything out of&#xD;
my head ; reason, honor, and manhood."&#xD;
".If she'd purred 'yes', with thet nutmeg.&#xD;

,y; anxiously.&#xD;

" 'oriard-rmarch. File right!'&#xD;

diat'ely Westerly's old friend, the Sergeant, ap-&#xD;
peared at the door, and his nine men of matri-&#xD;
monial meaiofy filed into the roomh, and quiet-&#xD;
ly' sur'ounded master and man. Felix gazed at&#xD;
these unannoiiced visitors with unqualified&#xD;
ainazement; but to say that he was terrified,&#xD;
would be doig injustice to his feelings.&#xD;
Sitriihteriing up with military stiffaess, he be-&#xD;
held these movements With gi-ha calmneis.&#xD;
"I trust you have been well, Sergeant,-since&#xD;
We last parted ?" he said; iroiieally.&#xD;
The Sergeant bowed slightly, and answered-:&#xD;
"Close up, mhen ! Mr. Westerly, follow me.&#xD;
Forwaid-inaren! Corne along, Sandhiller."&#xD;
These ommands were biriefand sharp. With&#xD;
head ei'ect, Felix obeyed, was dond deted through&#xD;
the hall and up stairs.  Barnaby,.imitating the&#xD;
coolness of his friend, kejt pace with him, step-&#xD;
pmig very higih, and sticking out his toes.&#xD;
" Betrayed, friend Barnaby ! Betrayed, from&#xD;
i'st to last! .This *hole thing lids been a se-&#xD;
ries of deceptions And fallaeies."&#xD;
Westerly spoke these words to Baraaby as&#xD;
they marched along.&#xD;
"If they weren't ilrhut me no worse nor be.&#xD;

"In here !" ordered the Sergeant, opening a&#xD;
door, and in went the Government agent, not&#xD;
caring what became of him. The door was&#xD;
shut behind him, and he and Barnaby fodud&#xD;
themselves the sole occupants of a commodious&#xD;
chamber.&#xD;
"It's all the same to me," muttered 3'eliz,&#xD;
and threw himself carelessly into the nearest&#xD;
chair.&#xD;
'' glad you'like it !" said the Sandhiller, sot-&#xD;
to voco.&#xD;
By-and-by Ielix arose.to his feet-very quick-&#xD;
ly, rubbed his eyes, and said.:&#xD;
"This is very extraordinary 1"&#xD;
"Whiel do you mean ?" Barnaby inquired.,&#xD;
"As I am a sinner I" exclaimed Felix, " this&#xD;
is the very room that I escaped from! There&#xD;
is no question about it. It is impossible to&#xD;
know what this means."&#xD;
Some one knocked; not at the door by whisk&#xD;
they had entered, but at a side-door.&#xD;
" Help yourself !" said Barnaby.  " We're&#xD;
in."&#xD;
'the door, swung open ,promptly, and across&#xD;
the threshold stepped-Esther.&#xD;
I'm prepared for anything!" observed Wes.&#xD;
terly, with resignation. "Nothing will surpriLse&#xD;
me after to-day."&#xD;
Ills wife's maid tossed her head, and made a&#xD;
conteniptuous mouth at him, to show him how&#xD;
little she thought of him, and how deep hii di..&#xD;
grace was.&#xD;
"class ' quoth Barnaby, "please. handle&#xD;
kerfully."&#xD;
"What a trash this is !" retorted Esther'&#xD;
flirting her skirts at the Sandhiller.&#xD;
"steady,!' continued Barnaby, squinting,&#xD;
"Eyes to the front. Dress up to the right."&#xD;
This singular kind of sarcasm struck the&#xD;
maid as being peculiarly flagrant and offer.'sive,&#xD;
and she snubbed him with :&#xD;
"Some folks '1 hear mifingtry orders enough&#xD;
soon enough !" She shrugged her pretty shoul-&#xD;
ders, and looked unfathomably knoviig. and&#xD;
grandly sarcastib.&#xD;
" A few paces and a empty boxes,!" she add-&#xD;
ed, with a portentous gesture. " Shoulder arms,&#xD;
lire !"&#xD;
"ew milatry tictacs I" remarked Barnaby,&#xD;
dhildly.&#xD;
Felix looked through the open door and saw&#xD;
his wife sitting at a table, with her back toward&#xD;
him, precisely as lie had seen her on a former&#xD;
occasion; He half arose and fell back, quite&#xD;
overcome.&#xD;
" Esther," he said, with a sepulchral attempt&#xD;
at humor ; "you can write' my obituary to.&#xD;
morrow."&#xD;
"      shher e sets, Sirl!" exclaimed the maid,&#xD;
in a most reproachful tone of rebuke, " a pinin'&#xD;
and a mopin' and dyin'of; fondness '&#xD;
" A  mild disorder, I hope," Wbsterly ass&#xD;
swerel. "Of recent ,origin. I suspect"&#xD;
&#xD;
" She's tonk on eve' since you ruin awa'.&#xD;
She began to love you, Sir, jest as you was get-&#xD;
tin' out of the window, " asserted Esther, with&#xD;
a sigh of regret. "She was in for it, Sir,, by&#xD;
the time you was out.}'&#xD;
"3arnaby, come and prick me with your,&#xD;
sword. I am not in my right mind. Stir me&#xD;
up, good Sandhiller "-&#xD;
Felix lay unck in his chair, and: shut his&#xD;
eyes; he murmured :&#xD;
"G o awa, dreams I"&#xD;
-"Vouhi ind it isn't dreams, Sir I" screamed'&#xD;
Esther. "Iher father, who is a. Blueb'a"d, has'&#xD;
'taken it into'his-owa hands, and I seldom never'&#xD;
seen him so raving. And this isn't the'worst&#xD;
o it; we know that you've gone and made love&#xD;
to another lady, Sir, which had the imperence&#xD;
to Come into this house."&#xD;

*hat is better, call'the Sergeant with his nine&#xD;
Wairioirs."&#xD;
"Bring me a tea-caddyi or som'at to hide in,"&#xD;
*egliested  arnaby.&#xD;
" Be funny, if you have a stomach for 'tI"&#xD;
Eethrned Esther, significantly. "I've knowed&#xD;
folks to eat their last, meat hearty." Then to&#xD;
Westerly '."&#xD;
" A certain somebody has heard of, your&#xD;
doin's, and I don't car' to tell you who were a&#xD;
listebin' at the window, when you, a married&#xD;
man, wickedly wanted to perpetuate bigamy by&#xD;
aakin' that bold hussy to have you, which isn't&#xD;
half so good-lookin' as your own lawful wedded&#xD;
wife, which saved your life by the same, when&#xD;
yo was condemned to be shot in retaliation for&#xD;
Confederate murders. Oh, I could tear your&#xD;
ekes' out with a good will, if it would do my&#xD;
poor dear mistress a mite of good!"&#xD;
lfelix heard a soft sob from the table in the&#xD;
other room, which put him more out of conceit&#xD;
of his wife than all Esther's scoldings. Lifting&#xD;
his eyelids and glancing covertly in the diree-&#xD;
tion of that griefful sound, he saw the head of&#xD;
his Eve go down upon her hands in a fashion&#xD;
to eVince emotion. This heaped the measure&#xD;
of his contempt, and he inwardly vowed to see&#xD;
no mlore.&#xD;
" here domes your wife's father," announced&#xD;
Estliet, suddenly suppressing the shrillness of&#xD;
bet voice.&#xD;
This announcement really made the young&#xD;
ain's blood tingle. If there were anything&#xD;
that he had no relish for, it was an interview&#xD;
with that' stern and' inflexible old man. His&#xD;
feelings were not so blunted as nt to dread his&#xD;
coming. With a smothered execration he&#xD;

TUS IN ONE.&#xD;
In etne Borrowecsle. Felix involuntarily&#xD;
aris . Ti'otigh the open door he saw the Ser-&#xD;
geant and his men drawn up with ordered arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
Father-in-law and son-in-law confronted  ach&#xD;
other.  The latter quailed before the steady&#xD;
look of the former.&#xD;
"We meet for the second time under peeuliar&#xD;
oirduanetances,' said, Borrowetle, frowning.&#xD;
" We meet again, withthingasomewhat ehan -&#xD;
,ed, but under circumstances stillpeculiar. We&#xD;
.had, on the occasional refer to,'a brief inte-&#xD;
iview, and our interview this thorning may alib&#xD;
be very bxibfs I snatched ybu' from death, and&#xD;
gave you rhy greatest treasure en . earth--my&#xD;
daughter Diana."&#xD;
The feminine figure at the table in' the ad-&#xD;
joining apatrtnient, appeared much agitated.&#xD;
Felix made-an impatient movement.&#xD;
, "You will remember," resumed Borrowbeale,&#xD;
That I placed'before you twb things-Death,&#xD;
Marriage."&#xD;
" You may as well waive the details" said&#xD;
Felix.&#xD;
" Your ehoicet is there," added Borroweeale,&#xD;
pointing to the bowed figure. " Insteadiof ap-&#xD;
preciating the very great honor conferred-upon&#xD;
you-not to speak of the benefactioh-y*t&#xD;
played the grumbler,' and escaped from.your&#xD;
wife4"&#xD;
" Withherwill and consentiwhich ris the only&#xD;
sensible thing I know of her," Felix observed&#xD;
"It becomes you not, young man; tb speak-&#xD;
ill of your wife. She is young, sheis beautiful,&#xD;
she is' rich. Don't'interrupt me. Oblige 'no&#xD;
by turning your eyes to-that door."&#xD;
Borrowscale glanced# toward the soldiers.&#xD;
I=see myquondain friend, the Sergeant, and&#xD;
his guard-nine me. with muskets. Proceed&#xD;
kind pater."&#xD;
The Federal agent bit his lips, and did- nob&#xD;
seem afraid of firearms so much as the arms of&#xD;
Diana.&#xD;
" There is no need-to be tedious and prosy&#xD;
about a plain matter," the grim old planter&#xD;
went on. "I have come to restore, in some&#xD;
sort, the former situation.  There sits' my&#xD;
daughter, your wife ; there are the Soldiers,&#xD;
Live with the one,, or die with the . others:&#xD;
Choose quickly."&#xD;
" Take the gal l" whispered Barnaby.&#xD;
"This is what you came to say ?" answered&#xD;
Felix, looking quietly at Borrowscale.&#xD;
"Essentially and literally. If I have not ex-&#xD;
pressed myself, in plain, straightforward Eng-&#xD;
lish, I will try again."&#xD;
It was undeniable that the planter had won-&#xD;
derful control over his voice and expression.&#xD;
" Pardon ale, if I repeat that Diana is young&#xD;
beautiful, and rich."&#xD;
" This is soon settled," replied Felix, his pride&#xD;
supporting him. "There are several reasons&#xD;
why Ishould not live-with the. lady you call&#xD;
my wife. One is, that I don't love her ; another&#xD;
is, that I won't 1"&#xD;
" Won't are a strong, reason 1"  muttered&#xD;
Barnaby.&#xD;

&#xD;
BARNABY, THE SANDIIILLER.&#xD;
&#xD;
88&#xD;
&#xD;
"Another reason is--well, another reason is,&#xD;
that I won't!"&#xD;
"Very explicit!" said Borrowscale, with un-&#xD;
bending firmness.&#xD;
" Besides. I love another woman, and I don't&#xD;
like the way the whole ridiculous thing has&#xD;
been managed. The fact is, it is absurd.&#xD;
There's no sense in it from, beginning to end.&#xD;
Such a farce would scarcelyamuse children, and&#xD;
--and,on the whole, I thine it will be a relief to&#xD;
be shot. For myself, I ask no kindness, but for&#xD;
my friend Barnaby here, I bespeak good-treat-&#xD;
ment. Give me a slip of paper, and I will give&#xD;
you a writing by which you shall receive six&#xD;
Confederate prisoners in exchange for him."&#xD;
" Durned if I want good treatment," roared&#xD;
Barnaby, " and hang me if I'll be exchangedI&#xD;
I'll be shot with the Capting, and it are no-&#xD;
body's business."&#xD;
"Young man," said Borrowscale, solemnly.&#xD;
" This is a serious moment. Follow the direc-&#xD;
tion of my hand : live-die I"&#xD;
The planter leveled his arm at Diana ; then&#xD;
at the Sergeant.&#xD;
" Die 1" answered Felix. " And you'll waste&#xD;
your time in attempts to change my determine.&#xD;
tion. I am so disappointed, and so heartily&#xD;
disgusted with this vexatious life, that I shall&#xD;
follow the Sergeant without much reluctance.&#xD;
X am ready. Lead on."&#xD;
" Shoulder arms! Left face-march 1" cried&#xD;
she Sergeant ; and instantly there was a rattle&#xD;
of arms and a movement of feet.&#xD;
"Be not in haste," said Barrowseale. " Will&#xD;
you not first see your wife's face?"&#xD;
"Excuse me !" retorted Felix, smiling and&#xD;
shrugging his shoulders.  "Hurry up, Ser-&#xD;
geant."&#xD;
Diana arose from the table, and, muffled&#xD;
closely in the same green vail which she had&#xD;
worn on the night of the marriage, approached&#xD;
him. Felix turned on his heel with a bitter&#xD;
sneer, when an exclamation from Barnaby&#xD;
caused him to look around. He saw Anna, and&#xD;
the green vail lay at her feet! He staggered&#xD;
like a drunken man, and Barnaby put out his&#xD;
hands to support him.&#xD;
" Away with him I" said Barrowscale, a smile&#xD;
for the first time appearing upon his lips.&#xD;
" No !" stammered Felix, faintly. " I-I re-&#xD;
voke-I-I will not be shot; unless as a pun&#xD;
Ishment for my stupidity."&#xD;
"Hooray I" shouted 1larnaby, capering about&#xD;
the room and hugging the Sergeant, and Esther,&#xD;
and anybody he could get hold of. " Iooray !&#xD;
Barrowscale forever !"&#xD;
The spangled cock, which had walked in with&#xD;
a consequential strut five minutes previously,&#xD;
few upon the mantel, flapped his wings wiph&#xD;
uncommon haste. and crowed with all the game-&#xD;
power he could muster at short notice.&#xD;
" Bully for you I" quoth Barnaby. " What&#xD;
a Abe Lakum it is, to be sure! And to think&#xD;
&#xD;
that Anna and Diana is dientical and one of.&#xD;
which ! She were good for him on her own&#xD;
heels, and has overmatched him two to one. I&#xD;
wouldn't min' the same."&#xD;
" Sergeant, I'm afraid you've lost a job!"&#xD;
cried Borrowseale, laughing, and rubbing his&#xD;
hands in great glee.&#xD;
" But I reckon you've saved your property,&#xD;
leastwise !" answered the Sergeant, chuckling,&#xD;
and sheathing his sword. "The darned Feds&#xD;
is within two miles of the plantation, and you've&#xD;
jest saved your cotton and your niggers, pur-&#xD;
vidin' your son-in law has the proper papers to&#xD;
show."&#xD;
" Here they are," replied Barrowacale, thrust-&#xD;
ing a package into Anna's hand. ' A man who&#xD;
has pluck enough to be shot, will have pluck&#xD;
enough to keep what lawfully belongs to him."&#xD;
" Oh, Anna !" exclaimed Felix, quite over.&#xD;
powered with emotion.. "Speak, so that I may&#xD;
know I am awake."&#xD;
Anna put her hand in his, and said, with a&#xD;
smile :&#xD;
" Remember, Sir, that I am a married wor..&#xD;
an !"&#xD;
Felix kissed his wife's hand.&#xD;
" Tell me with your own lips, that you are&#xD;
Diana as well as Anna."&#xD;
" One and the same, Felix," she answered,&#xD;
in a charming manner.&#xD;
" Heaven be praised I" responded Felix, fer-&#xD;
vently. " One more question," he added:&#xD;
"-What was this marriage for ?"&#xD;
" That is the serious' and unpleasant part of&#xD;
it," said Anna.&#xD;
" The cause of it was human selfishness,"&#xD;
interliosed Barrowsecale. "I have a splendid&#xD;
property, which I determined to save from con-&#xD;
ifiseaion and pillage by having a Yankee son-&#xD;
in-law. I found you a prisoner, liked your ap-&#xD;
pearance, and thought you would do as well as&#xD;
another. - That was the reason of two things:&#xD;
Death or Marriage. All Anna's mischief she&#xD;
must.herself explain. That packet which yoa&#xD;
see, constitutes her and your legal claims to a&#xD;
property worth half a million. My hopes ans&#xD;
wishes are more than gratified. Be happy&#xD;
with my daughter. In a few days I shall. leave&#xD;
this distracted country for Europe, nor shall I&#xD;
return till peace is restored."&#xD;
Borrowscale shook hands with Felix, and was&#xD;
considerably affected.&#xD;
BaInaby Cruise jogged Felix with his elbow,&#xD;
and said, staring at Mrs. Westerly :&#xD;
" You've got three of 'ei in one, by mighty l&#xD;
Diana, Anna, and Andrew."&#xD;
" No !" queried Felix, drawing his wife tow-&#xD;
ard him, and saluting her lips. " I have not&#xD;
married Cousin Andrew, too ?"&#xD;
" But you have, though !" said Anna.&#xD;
"It's the most wonderful thing I ever knew,"&#xD;
quoth Felix.&#xD;
Anna's eyes flashed intelligence to his;&#xD;
&#xD;
BARNABY, THE&#xD;
Anna's hand was in his; Anna's heart was in&#xD;
his.&#xD;
And the soldiers went out of the room; and&#xD;
Borrowscale went out of the room; and Barna-&#xD;
by and his spangled cock went out of the room ;&#xD;
and left Felix with love and Anna-and half a&#xD;
million,&#xD;
On the following' day, a column of Federal&#xD;
infantry arrived, with the intention of con-&#xD;
liscating large quantities of cotton stored on&#xD;
ihe plantation, and of taking away all the able-&#xD;
bodied negroes; but finding Felix Westerly in&#xD;
quiet possession, with undoubted ownership and&#xD;
known loyalty, and a handsome wife, they gave&#xD;
three rousing cheers, partook of his hospitality,&#xD;
and retired.&#xD;
The generous Confederate who assisted Felix&#xD;
and Barnaby to escape from Allerton's parti-&#xD;
sans proved to be a Union spy ; and the former&#xD;
afterward met him confidentially as an agent of&#xD;
Government.&#xD;
Barnaby forgot to send relief to Absalom&#xD;
Wills till late in the day, when the messengers&#xD;
cae back, saying that he could not be found.&#xD;
ems weeks after, the Sandhiller discovered a&#xD;
&#xD;
SANDIIILLER.                          g&#xD;
skeleton sitting against a tree ; but was not in.&#xD;
lined to the belief that it was the remaining&#xD;
mortality of the overseer. He carried 'Tildy'&#xD;
White the scrip and greenbacks, and--some.&#xD;
yellow snuff! He sent his mother, also, some-&#xD;
yellow snuff! And each of his sisters some-"-&#xD;
yellow snuff! These friendly and filial acts-&#xD;
showed him sound-on the tobacco question, and,&#xD;
-up to snuff!&#xD;
The negroes on Borrowscale's plantation con-&#xD;
eluded toiremain with their new Federal mas-&#xD;
ter. However, a general stampede of blacks&#xD;
took place about that time ; and General Grant's&#xD;
army received many contrabands with arms in&#xD;
their hands.&#xD;
Barnaby Cruise still keeps the spangled&#xD;
cock; but is obliged to leave it at home when.&#xD;
on secret duty, being at the present time em-&#xD;
ployed much as a National scout; a service to&#xD;
which he is particularly fitted on account of his&#xD;
knowledge of the ,country. The Sandhiller is&#xD;
the best hand at telling a story in the Depar-&#xD;
ment of the Southwest.&#xD;
