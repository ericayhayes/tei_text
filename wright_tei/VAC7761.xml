CHATEX. I.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT was one of those bright and beautiful days late in&#xD;
spnng, when the air is full of fragrance and melody, and the&#xD;
dazzling beam and the merry breeze carry happiness to ev~&#xD;
ery heart not. dark with the shadows of recent sorrow. The&#xD;
sun was midway between the meridian and the horizon,&#xD;
whelk Drayton rose from the bench on which he had .been&#xD;
sitting, and, throwing aside his apron and the implements of&#xD;
his craft, left the shop where he had worked faithfully since&#xD;
the rising of the sun. He soon arrayed himself in a suit of&#xD;
genteel clothes, and, picking up a volume of Plutarch, r~turn-&#xD;
ed. to the shop.&#xD;
Just then a carriage halted in front of the house, and a&#xD;
man, well known as the richest and most aristocratic person&#xD;
in that section, alighted. He approached Drayton, and in&#xD;
an abrupt and loud tone of voica said,&#xD;
"Boy,'~te my boots. done ?"&#xD;
No, sir, they are not yet begun," was the reply.&#xD;
"sot begun !" repeated the haughty customer, with a&#xD;
frown. "I intend to start for the city to-morrow, and waut&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"I told you when you ordered them, that, owing to the&#xD;
amount ~f work on J~iand, they could not be done before next&#xD;
Saturday," said Drayton, mildly.&#xD;
"What's the reason you're not working at them now, sir,&#xD;
insolently demanded the aristocrat; "Why ain't you work-&#xD;
ing on my boots, instead of being dressed up like a buck, with&#xD;
a book in your hand, on y*r way, I suppose, to smash the&#xD;
heart of' some other cobbler's daughter ?"&#xD;
Drayton felt indignant, 'but said nothing. As h~v~Qdded&#xD;
pleasantly to a friend passing. on the :opposite side of the street,&#xD;
the aristocrat, growing somewhat compassionate, condescend-'&#xD;
.ed to give Drayto~ sortie advice in a gruff voice.&#xD;

of leistire. A shoemaker ought to stick to' his last. That's&#xD;
the only chance of bacon and beans for him. What's the&#xD;
name of the book in your hand?"&#xD;
"A volume of Plutarch," replied Drayton.&#xD;
Some trashy romance, I suppose, tho~h I never heard of&#xD;
it before," said' the aristocrat. "You had better throw it&#xD;
away, sir, and stick to your last. I'm afraid you're trying to&#xD;
get above your bu~i~ess."&#xD;
The conversation was here interrupted by the proprietor of&#xD;
the shop, who made his appearance, and forthwith began to&#xD;
apologize with the most 8paniel-like humility. The insolence&#xD;
of the aristocrat and the~ fawning of the shoemaker formed a&#xD;
spectacle which disgusted Drayton~ and he left them without&#xD;
delay.&#xD;
As he passed ~aIong the street, he struggled with the feel-&#xD;
ings he had* curbed so well while in the presence of the igno..&#xD;
rant and purse-proud aristocrat. It was by no means the first&#xD;
occasion on which' he had felt the scorn of the minions of&#xD;
wealth. Often had his feelings been embittered by those men&#xD;
who seem to think that the heart of a poor boy is made to be&#xD;
cru~hedi by an iron heel. And now, as he thought"of the in~&#xD;
solence with which he had been treated by a man of wealth&#xD;
and eonaequence, a man whose ear was familiar with the notes&#xD;
of adtd&amp;amp;~Eion; his face was flushed with anger~ When he&#xD;
thought of the ignorance of the man who supposed a volume&#xD;
of Plutarch to be a trashy romance, he could not but feel great&#xD;
contempt for him. Often, on such occasions, he renewed the&#xD;
settled purpose of his heart to effect a triumph over the ob-&#xD;
stacks which surrounded him, and claim of the world that&#xD;
hmage which wealth can not purchase and genius alone can&#xD;
~ exact. For years he had been preparing himself for those in-&#xD;
tellectual conflicts which precede the wreath of the victor,&#xD;
cheered~by the presence of.hope, and sustained by an uiifalter-&#xD;
ing faith in his ability to execute the highest resolve of his&#xD;
'~~it. He would reaoh an elevation where the proud man's&#xD;
~eora and the neglect of the rich could not approach him, and'&#xD;
e~iXse' the sons~ of those who had treated him superciliously to&#xD;
esteem the' grasp of 11i8 hand '~a peculiar favo~ and to re-&#xD;
gard a smjle from his~ lip as ~f more value than the xnostglit-&#xD;
terrn~ofco is.&#xD;
His feelings were less turbulent as he entered the forestand&#xD;
puraned his way toward: the beautiful beech-grove, whither he&#xD;
so often repaired to~~oy cernmiinlon'with nature~~ and hirowri&#xD;
beart, and the works' of the ilhieWiouo~ dead.~ lie placed him..&#xD;

J&#xD;
&#xD;
* self in his accustomed seat, and opened the volume, and began&#xD;
to read the life' of Pericles. As he read the account of the:&#xD;
Simian war, and of the funeral obsequies of those who fell in&#xD;
it, and recalled. to mind the splendid oration as given in Thu-&#xD;
cydides, he closed the book, an&amp;amp; the whole pageant seemed to&#xD;
move before him, and he felt that under such circumstances&#xD;
he too could be an orator.&#xD;
At that moment his attention was diverted from the mag-&#xD;
nificent scene in the city of iVilinerva to an elderly gentleman,&#xD;
who approached and saluted him with much cordiality. He&#xD;
seemed to be about 'sixty years of age, and was clad in a rusty&#xD;
suit of black, cut in the fashion of that day. Every thing&#xD;
about him, from his cravat to his knee-buckle; indicated the&#xD;
most through disregard of dress. His hat was drawn down&#xD;
over his forehead so as almost to hide the keen, dark eye that&#xD;
glowed in its socket like a living coal. His nose was most&#xD;
decidedly Roman, and his mouth was handsome, and express-&#xD;
ive of firmness. He 'wore a cue, and spoke with a deep, clear,&#xD;
musical tone. His name was James Thompson, a name well&#xD;
known fifty years ago;' for he was a lawyer of great eccen-&#xD;
tricity, great eloquence, dexterity, and learning. 'Although&#xD;
he never enjoyed a national fame, it was not because hewarited&#xD;
the power to win such fame, 'but because he was tooindolent&#xD;
to address himself to the task of grasping the' laureL&#xD;
Mr. Thompson had known Drayt'~n from his. childhood.&#xD;
The quickness and capacity of the boy did not escape the in-&#xD;
qiiisitive glance of the shrewd and penetrating lawyer. He&#xD;
encouraged ])ra~ton in the prosecution of his studies, talked&#xD;
with him frequently, and loaned him most of the books he&#xD;
read.&#xD;
Drayton told Mr. Thompson of the insolence with wbich he&#xD;
had been treated. The lawyer listened attentively to' his nax-&#xD;
rative, and said,&#xD;
"That man, so haughty';and overbearing in his' deportxaent&#xD;
toward you, has humiliated himself s~ thousand times ii~"~iy&#xD;
presence. He never gives a dinner-party that he does not beg&#xD;
and' entreat me to attend, for' he' has just sense enough to know&#xD;
that such' occasions can rnt' pasw off ~with eclat' ultiless' thej are&#xD;
enlivened by a man of some genius.'?&#xD;
"That proves the truth of a counnon rerriark~ that a man&#xD;
who is intolerant to those he regards o~ his inferioza' i~ sure -&#xD;
to be servile toward his superiors," said Drayton.&#xD;
"As' long as you: consent to w~isti~ jour time arid' your tel.&#xD;
ents in a shoemaker's shop," said iMr. Thompson, ~~'n can&#xD;

&#xD;
not expect men who have n6 sagacity to have mttch respect&#xD;
for yow A half-witted boy can make as comfortable a shoe&#xD;
as you can, and you' should leave such labor to those who are&#xD;
qualified for no higher- occupation. Your father made a great -&#xD;
mistake when he consigned you to lasts and lapstones, and you&#xD;
should rectify it by deserting those useful things as soon as&#xD;
practicable."&#xD;
"As I have told you heretofore," replied Drayton, "nothing&#xD;
but the obligation I am. under to Mr. Smith prevents my ac-&#xD;
ceptance of the extremely kind offer you have made me to&#xD;
enter your office and" study jaw."&#xD;
Well, now, 'as to that obligation, which is such a mount-&#xD;
ain in your way," said Mr. Thompson, "I will undertake to&#xD;
satisfy it, and relieve you from it. Smith is a man who has&#xD;
a money value for every thing he owns, and 'he will be per-&#xD;
fectly willing to sell the claim he holds against you for an-&#xD;
othei' year's service." -&#xD;
"That would only transfer the obligation from him to&#xD;
you.&#xD;
"Well, to satisfy your excessive scrupulosity," said Mr.'&#xD;
Thompson, "I will take your note for the 'amount I pay&#xD;
Smith, and pledge myself to collect every stiver of both prin-&#xD;
cipal and interest at some future day."&#xD;
Mr. Thompson's. generosity overwhelmed Drayton; and&#xD;
aft~rsdnie further conversation on the subject, he consented&#xD;
t~fr~ up the shop and enter the office of the lawyer on&#xD;
Mr. Thompson's terms.&#xD;
"I take a very singular interest..-.a singularly deep inter-&#xD;
est in you," said Mr..Thompson. "Do' you know that when&#xD;
you are in my presence it seems as if my youth were come&#xD;
back to me-.-.as if the May and the November of my life&#xD;
had met together? My hopes, my 'aspirations, my -tastes&#xD;
were similar to yours. A genuine love of the beautiful dwelt.&#xD;
in my heart. I -watched with intense interest the develop-&#xD;
ment and. the decay of vegetatio~i.-....the approach, the hab-'&#xD;
its, and the departure of the birds-the ways of the insect&#xD;
world-.-4he grace of the mountain stream, winding circui-&#xD;
tously around rocks, and then dashing over a precipice, and&#xD;
regarded a thousand other objects in earth, sea, and sky with&#xD;
an/interest which l~ would not have exchanged for the most&#xD;
splendid fortune, if I had had an opportunity of doing any&#xD;
thing so stupid."&#xD;
"You have not outlived your. relish for such objects," re-&#xD;
marked' Drayton..    . ..'    .      -&#xD;

PILAYTON..&#xD;
~ If my heart should ever forget its homage to natus~e,"&#xD;
said Mr. Thompson, "may it that instant be palsied in every&#xD;
pulse, and all its streams as hushed as the brook in the grasp&#xD;
of the bitter north wind. When a man who has enjoyed the&#xD;
luxury of loving nature outlives that love, he is a~ fit subject&#xD;
for the scythe of Time. Mind you, I do not mean, when I&#xD;
speak of a love of nature, that shallow feeling which is sat-&#xD;
isfied with the external beauty of a landscape, in which&#xD;
fields, forests, houses, and streams are so distributed as to&#xD;
produce a pleasing emotion in the mind-I do not mean the&#xD;
worship of forms; but I do mean a deep, engrossing, per-&#xD;
vading sentiment, which appreciates what lies beyond the&#xD;
reach of sense, and enables one to establish a spiritual corn-&#xD;
munioxi with nature. This feeling is far more profound than&#xD;
that instinctive desire for what is beautiful in form, which&#xD;
is so common. It is both religious and~ philosophical; for&#xD;
while it lQoks into the. conditions in which things exist, it&#xD;
prompts the spirit to spring fro~m the star, or the trees or the&#xD;
rocky cliff, or whatever object it, contemplates, up to that&#xD;
Great Power which endowed it and commissioned it to co-&#xD;
operate with other agents in perfecting this magnificent crea&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"I would suppose the possession of such a sentiment as&#xD;
precious beyond all. calculation,"' said Drayton. "It must&#xD;
certainly add immensely to the amoi~tut .of its pwner'~ l~p-&#xD;
piness. Indeed, if any thing could restore to earth e~&#xD;
ti6n 9f that wonderful beauty which was lost 'wh~ii 'tii~&#xD;
* glQry departed from Eden, it would be such a. seutixn~nt 'as&#xD;
that you have described."&#xD;
"Take my' advice, my young friend," said Mr. Thompsou,&#xD;
earnestly, "and cherish that sentiment, enrich it,. and cling&#xD;
to it through~ life's vicissitudes, for. jt .wil1~ brighten yeu*&#xD;
pleasures, and prove a fountain of joy even in the midst 9*~&#xD;
a desert. As I said, my interest in you comes from the- fact&#xD;
that in you I seem to see a resurrection of the years of my&#xD;
youth, You have, more ambition and more perseverance&#xD;
than I had, and you will rise to far higher distinction' than&#xD;
I have enjoyed, provided yon toil as they who -~reacli the&#xD;
glittering goal must toil. I might have comn.anded 'the&#xD;
applause of listening senates,' but. I preferred my easa. In&#xD;
practicing my profession, I have had occasion t9 meastare&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
WITHIN &amp;amp; week Mr. Thompson. succeeded in making the&#xD;
necessary arrangements, and Drayton entered his office as a&#xD;
student. The kind-hearted and eccentric old lawyer had a&#xD;
fine library, well stocked not only with professional works,&#xD;
but with all the most famous books from the Iliad down.&#xD;
He took great pleasure in superintending Drayton's studies,&#xD;
and often provoked controverSies which called into requisi-&#xD;
tion 'all ~of the facts and the logic that~ the pupil could sum-&#xD;
mon to his aid. At other times he would talk with him&#xD;
about great men and the contents of world-renowned books.&#xD;
He was fond of recurring to cases of iilterest in which he had&#xD;
been engaged, and then his sketches of the characters and~&#xD;
peculiarities of judges and lawyers were very amusing and&#xD;
piquant. He had been intimately acquainted with many of&#xD;
the' most celebrated patriots, and heroes, and orators of our&#xD;
Revolutionary struggle, and would often describe them. He&#xD;
told many anecdotes illustrative of the great men whose de..&#xD;
votio2n to country was proved in the midst of perils by self-&#xD;
sacrifices rather than by noisy professions . The struggles&#xD;
of some of these men from a condition of unbefriended- pov-&#xD;
erty up to renown, was a subject of which Drayton's -ear&#xD;
never gvew weary. What had so. often crowned the efforts&#xD;
of the lowly and the obscure was still attainable, and he re-&#xD;
solved- to afford another illustration ofthe truth that, from&#xD;
whatsoever point in the valley genius may start, it is sure,&#xD;
when its energies are well directed, to ascen4 to the daz-&#xD;
zling eminences of fame.&#xD;
Drayton passed more than three years most pleasantly&#xD;
'~iidptofita1ily in Mr~ Thompson's office, and was .then ex-&#xD;
amined and licensed to practice law. Thus much having&#xD;
been accomplished, he proceeded to carry out a resolution&#xD;
which he had cherished through many years~&#xD;
lu the vicinity of a city, about fifty miles distant, his an-&#xD;
eator4 had lived in opulence through. three successive gen4.&#xD;
A -&#xD;
&#xD;
k&#xD;
&#xD;
~RAYTON.                      It&#xD;
qratlons. His grandfather inherited an ample f6rtixie~;but&#xD;
impoverished his resources by wild excesses and prodigality.&#xD;
and died in the prime of life, a victim to his own impru-&#xD;
dences,. leaving an only son to' struggle with the ills of pov-&#xD;
erty. As that 'son approached manhood, he thought him-&#xD;
self neglected by. many of those who had been proud to avail&#xD;
themselves of his father's hospitalities, and, resolving to get&#xD;
beyond the reach of their scorn, removed to a- village in the&#xD;
interior. He was very thriftless. Every thing he engaged&#xD;
in turned out ill. He married while yet young, and his life&#xD;
was spent in wretched -efforts to increase the comforts of his&#xD;
family. His oldest son, Frank Drayton,- was, as has beeu&#xD;
seen, apprenticed to a. shoemaker. The father was very&#xD;
fond of referring to the - former condition of his family, and&#xD;
frequently spoke of the splendid mansion in ~vJhich he was&#xD;
born, and of the', elegantly-cultivated grounds in which he&#xD;
had played in his childhood. His descriptions of the splen-&#xD;
dor in which his ancestors lived fired the youthful imagina-&#xD;
tion of his son, who, early in life, resolved that he would re-&#xD;
build the shattered fortunes of his family, and iescue- the&#xD;
name of Drayton from the disrepute into which it had fall-&#xD;
en. This purpose had sustained him through many a long&#xD;
and weary hour of study. He fancied no labor too great for&#xD;
the rich recompense of which he dreamed. It is worthy of -&#xD;
notice, that every man of genius and ambition cherishes some -&#xD;
secret enterprise, which, while it furnishes him with, the un-&#xD;
pulses that govern him, is but dimly shadowed forth in his&#xD;
conduct. The cold and barren isolation of fame would not&#xD;
be so sedulously striven for were its attainment -unassociated&#xD;
with darling considerations which spring out of the circum-&#xD;
stanc~es that surround the - aspirant.&#xD;
IHIa.ving made his arrangements, Drayton took leave of his&#xD;
family and friends, and started for the city. Toward sun-&#xD;
down, on the second day of his journey, he reached-the sum-&#xD;
mit of the hill from which the city whither he was going&#xD;
becomes visible- to the eye of the traveler who approaches it&#xD;
from that direction. He checked his horsQ ~and deliberately&#xD;
surveyed the beautiful prospect before him.' The sun was&#xD;
sinking behind a mass 9f clouds in. great - magnificence, au&amp;amp; -.&#xD;
a Sabbath-like calm prevailed over ~the scene, broken only&#xD;
by the distant lowing of cattle returning to their homes, and&#xD;
the nearer melodies of birds and insects. The majestic river&#xD;

A~ Drayton's' eye Wandered over the section in which his&#xD;
ancestors, had flourished~and fallen through several success&#xD;
ive generations, all tha e had heard and all that' he had&#xD;
drean~ed of its exceeding loveliness seemed to him to be fully&#xD;
realized. After looking at several of the most conspicuous&#xD;
objects in the prospect before him, he fixed his eye on the&#xD;
city, which was indistinctly visible in the distance. As he&#xD;
Thought of the resolution which led him to abandon the home&#xD;
of his' boyhood and to become a sojourner among those who&#xD;
kne~hini upt~ an expression of deep thoughtfulness settled&#xD;
on~ this face ~More than ever he felt the difficulty of the&#xD;
QaTee1~orL which he'was about entering. He had no friends&#xD;
in the city in which he had resolved' to try his fortunes. By&#xD;
turns his heart faltered and. grew bold. Hopes and fears,&#xD;
thoughts of success and of failure, mingled together in his&#xD;
mind with all the confusion of a phalanx of clouds muster-&#xD;
ing their forces in the evening sky; and yet, had the eye of&#xD;
a obse~yer been on him, he might have supposed him af-&#xD;
fected ~n'ly-by'some 'one. of the ten thousand frivolities which&#xD;
mex~ take to heart. Thi~s we are in the habit of glancing&#xD;
iudifhi~rently on faces; not even excepting those which, could&#xD;
we read their meaning, would assure us~that we stood in the&#xD;
presence of persons on whose minds are the foreshadowing&#xD;
of mighty events. The human mind grows prophetic when&#xD;
it observes young men; but so short-sighted are the seers,&#xD;
that success is generally assigned to the crippled and failure&#xD;
to the most eminently gifted, in. whose natures are wrapped&#xD;
up the -elements of future greatness, just as the trunk and&#xD;
overshadowing branches of the monarch of the forest, are&#xD;
wrapped up in the acorn.&#xD;
Drayton's heart soon' regained its accustomed firmness and&#xD;
seli~reliance, and all trace of fear and doubt passed from his&#xD;
features. His face was both striking and interesting, as all&#xD;

lug, dark gray eye, so deeply seated beneath the brow that&#xD;

CHAPTER IlL&#xD;
As Drayton sat on his horse revolving some of his schemes&#xD;
of ambition, forgetfttl alike of the hour and the scene, a flock&#xD;
of chattering birds wheeled over his head and recalled him&#xD;
from his abstractedness. Perceiving that the sun was seP&#xD;
ting, he glanced again rapidly over the ht~ndscape, and then&#xD;
urged his horse onward~&#xD;
He -had yet five miles 'to go, but so tempting were nu'.&#xD;
inerous objects along the road side that he rode leisurely, now&#xD;
stopping to admire the beauty of a cottage, and again stop-&#xD;
ping to observe some aristocratic abode. Over to the right,&#xD;
toward the bank of the river, a large stone mansion of-ven-&#xD;
erable appearance, situated on a gentle eminence~ soon com-&#xD;
manded his most particular attention. That was the home&#xD;
of his ancestors, and he recognized it ~as such from- the de-&#xD;
scription of it by his father. He would gladly 'have lingered&#xD;
longer to survey the spot ~f which he had heard so much;&#xD;
but as 'he had three miles to ride, and the shades' of even-&#xD;
ing were. darkening over the scene, he was forced to for-ego&#xD;
that pleasure4 The moon's pale crescent was sailing-bright-&#xD;
ly. over the top' of the westerft hills before he reached th~&#xD;
&#xD;
lev*, was designed' for a nobler use than to fade aw~.y in the&#xD;
turmoil of this world. It was an eye to read the stars and&#xD;
the heart of man, and could not grow dim, in the byways of&#xD;
obscurity. 1~LEasses of deep auburn, hair waved along the&#xD;
summit of his massive and capacious forehead, on which the&#xD;
power to think was apparent to the dullest eye. His nose&#xD;
was slightly aquiline, and his mon4 with its frill and, com-&#xD;
pressed lips, expressed more determination' than is usual&#xD;
with those who have not passed their: twenty-fourth year.&#xD;
He was tall and robust in form, and a judge of character&#xD;
would have pronounced him a proud man. And he was&#xD;
proud, as the majority of self-made men are, who, having~&#xD;
forced their way upward through difficulties appalling to&#xD;
meaner natures, feel their superiority. In conversatibn he&#xD;
spoke with clearness and distinctness, though with uuuisii~.l.&#xD;
rapidity. Thus he appeared to the eye. His character will&#xD;
be developed hereafter in his conduct.&#xD;

&#xD;
s~iburbs of- the eit~ As he rode along one of the principal&#xD;
streets, the sounds of the footsteps of the multitude and the&#xD;
jargon of blending voices, forming a perfect ~o~trast~to the&#xD;
deep silence which reigned over his own 'native village at&#xD;
that hour, excited a thousand thoughts and emotions in his&#xD;
mind. At length a sign-post attracted his attention, a~id,&#xD;
not knowing whither to~~go for the night, he reined in his&#xD;
horse and alighted.&#xD;
The tavern which 'he entered was extensively known by&#xD;
the lovers of good cheer by the name of the ".Rising Sun.,'&#xD;
-to6k its name from its sign, on which was displayed one&#xD;
of a very dull yellow orb, from which flared up broad&#xD;
eaks 'of' saffron light. The lower half was submerged in&#xD;
an ocean of indigo, in one' corner of which appeared a dim&#xD;
ship in a very perilous situation, while in the opposite cor~&#xD;
ner there was a duck amusing' itself in the spray of a billow&#xD;
frowning with wrath.   '              ~.-&#xD;
The patriots of the city were in the habit of resorting to&#xD;
this house to talk over the horrors of the French Revolu-&#xD;
tion, the depredations of British cruisers on American com-&#xD;
merce, the Alien and Sedition Laws, and other engrossing&#xD;
topics of the day. It was the rendezvous of the Democratic&#xD;
leaders of the city, who under sits hospitable roof qnaffed&#xD;
their liquor, smoked their sears, and grew voluble in dis-&#xD;
cussing the 'rights' of man and the policy of the government.&#xD;
With laudable impartiality, the host pocketed coin from the&#xD;
purses of: Federalists as well as from those of Democrats;&#xD;
and it was hinted that he manifested a very strong predi-&#xD;
lection for the gold of his political opponents, by exacting&#xD;
from them higher prices for his entertainment than any&#xD;
good Democrat was ever known to pay. On one occasion&#xD;
Mr. Jefferson honored the Rising Sun by eating and sleeping&#xD;
in it, and thenceforth the room he occupied was known as&#xD;
the "Jefferson apartment." On this circumstance the wor-&#xD;
thy landlord would grow unusually eloquent while conduct-&#xD;
i-ng some distinguished Democrat to its sacred shades, not&#xD;
forgetting tomention the many kind remarks the future pres-&#xD;
ident had made concerning the excellence of his accommo.&#xD;
nationss.&#xD;
'The long ride gave great vigor to Drayton's .appetite, and&#xD;
he did atnple justice to the excellent viands- at. the supper-&#xD;
'table.. When he had finished his repast, he sauntered into&#xD;
the bar-room, in which a considerable number of persons&#xD;
were killing time according to the most approved methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
L~RArTON.&#xD;
He amused himself a while by listening t~poi~ie he~.ted poli~&#xD;
tician~, and then walked out into the street ~o indulge his&#xD;
own fancies.&#xD;
Tired of wandering listlessly about where every scene and&#xD;
Bound was unfamiliar to him, he at length sought his chain-&#xD;
ber, and watched from the window the lightning playing&#xD;
over the 4ark form of a distant cloud. As the hours went&#xD;
by, the sounds of footsteps and voices became less frequent;&#xD;
and when the clock struck twelve, that tomb-like silence,&#xD;
which is peculiar to the deserted streets of a city, wrapped&#xD;
its slumbering thousands like a garment Long after th~&#xD;
lights had vanished from the opposite windows, Drayt&#xD;
maintained his seat, thinking of the friends, he had left, an~*&#xD;
speculating 9n. his future career.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
NEXT morning, Drayton went in quest of an uncle of his&#xD;
mother's, who lived in the city. As' he proceeded on his&#xD;
way, glancing indifferently at the strange faces he enc&amp;amp;~un~&#xD;
tered, his attention was suddenly riveted on a lady of strik-&#xD;
ing beauty, who was passing along with a quick step. A&#xD;
more beautiful object had never dawned on his vision~ The&#xD;
brilliant black eye,' the arched brow, the smiling lip, and&#xD;
splendid form, though seen but for a moment, left a deep&#xD;
impression on his mind. Involvntarily turning, he watched&#xD;
her receding form, until she entered a house at a short dis-&#xD;
tauce. He marked the place and passed on, musing on the&#xD;
beauty of the fair being who had so unexpectedly enamored&#xD;
him until'he arrived at the. residence of his uncle.&#xD;
Mr. Alexander Macdonald was born on the border of one&#xD;
of the most beautiful lochs of Scotland, and emigrat&amp;amp;l, while&#xD;
a youth, with his, father to America, some years before the&#xD;
breaking out of our war of Independence. 'He studied med-&#xD;
icine, became a successful practitioner, and accumulatedd. a&#xD;
fortune. ~He had lived more than 'threescore years, and was&#xD;
suffering the penalty of his devotion to some convivial ex- -&#xD;
cesses. The gout had been his constant companion for sev-&#xD;
eral seasons, and had banished every amiable feeling from&#xD;
his bosom. Added to hisphysical and spiritual afflictions,&#xD;

&#xD;
he was a bachelor, and the affairs of bi~ household were&#xD;
continually entangled in~difficulties. His condition was 'de.&#xD;
plorable; every effort he made at~ domestic reform was un-&#xD;
successful, and he now despaired of ever seeing the day&#xD;
when his expectations of comfort should be realized. He&#xD;
was the very Job of old bachelors, if any one should be sin-&#xD;
gled out by that designation from a class where all are mis-&#xD;
erable.&#xD;
Drayton's mother, when a child, was a great favorite with&#xD;
the doctor. She had written to him on her son's behalf,&#xD;
and received a kindly answer. When Drayton entered his&#xD;
unde's apartment, he beheld a gentleman of great corpu-&#xD;
lency sitting in a large an~d easy chair, with his right foot&#xD;
reposing on a velvet cushion. His hair, naturally sandy, was&#xD;
whitened by age, and over ,~is broad, prominent forehead a&#xD;
succession of well-d'efined wrinkles were seen circling above&#xD;
his bushy eyebrows, indicating intense thought and long suf-&#xD;
fering. The small gray eye moving restlessly in its socket,&#xD;
the aquiline nose and quivering lips completed the promi-&#xD;
nent features of a face' striking but' ~nnlovely. He was por-&#xD;
ing over a large volume when Drayton .entered, and for a&#xD;
moment did not observe him. 'Drayton hemmed, and the&#xD;
sound fell on the old gentleman's ear, who, without lifting&#xD;
1~is eye from the page, said, in a rough voice,&#xD;
"Well, what's the matter nbw ?"&#xD;
,Thi~ ungentle salutation startled Drayton.. For an in-&#xD;
stant he was undetennined whether to advance or retreat.&#xD;
While thus. hesitating, the doctor glanced toward him, and&#xD;
in a quick. and more amiable tone said,&#xD;
"I beg pardon, sir. 'I thought it was, a fiendish' servant&#xD;
who has been troubling me all the morning. Come in, sir."&#xD;
Drayton advanced and extended 'his hand, saying, "My&#xD;
name is Drayton - Frank Drayton. I arrived here last&#xD;
night, and have called to pay my respects to an uncle, of&#xD;
whom I have frequently heard my mother speak."&#xD;
"The deuce you say," 'said the doctor, elevating his specta-&#xD;
cles, find rapidly surveying Drayton's proportions. "Bring&#xD;
up that chair and sit by my side, boy."&#xD;
The doctor looked at him until he was seated, when he&#xD;
continued, "Why, Mr. Frank, you are a fine-looking fellow.&#xD;
The old-fashioned Macdonald eye, Eli swear." And he&#xD;
grasped Frank's hand and shook it cordially. After a~ few&#xD;
questions ~about the family, the doctor asked,&#xD;
"Well, sir, what are you going to do'?"&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.&#xD;
""?raotice 'my: profession, sir."&#xD;
"Ah! yes-.-a'lawyer I believe you are&#xD;
"Yes, sir," replied Drayton. "I have abandoned my for..&#xD;
mer occupation, and am no longer a disciple of St. Crispin."&#xD;
"Hark ye, my boy," said the doctor,~ "keep that to your-&#xD;
self. 'Don't make a ninny of yourself :by confessing that you&#xD;
ever knew any' thing about the cobbler's saint."&#xD;
"Why, sir, it is not dishonorable to have been a maker of.&#xD;
shoes," urged Drayton, innocently~&#xD;
"so, sir," replied the doctor, with a squint- of the' right&#xD;
eye and a shrug of the shoulder; "not when a man has be-&#xD;
come eminent. But, before you become famous, take my a&amp;amp;.&#xD;
vice, and profess entire ignorance of the mystery of making&#xD;
shoes; for if you do not, most persons. of delicate sensibilities&#xD;
will fancy there is a very unpleasant odor of wax about you,&#xD;
and you will observe a very unequivocal tendency in most&#xD;
noses to turn up when you are by. That's all, sir. If you&#xD;
are an admirer of aquiline noses, sir, don't say you have&#xD;
made shoes, or you will see but few resemblances to the old~&#xD;
Roman nose in this community."&#xD;
The doctor's nose looked the thing he described 'as he&#xD;
spoke, and Drayton was forced to smile at his expense. He&#xD;
made no reply, and a short silence ensued, affording him an&#xD;
opportunity of surveying the room more particularly than he&#xD;
had yet done. It was a well-fnrnished apartment, and the&#xD;
crimson curtains caused every object to look as red as a&#xD;
milk-maid's cheek. The "vermil-tinctured" nose of the doc-&#xD;
tor imbibed a deeper dye fron~. the red light of the room, and&#xD;
glowed brilliantly. Drayton noticed particularly a portrait&#xD;
of his uncle, taken at the age of thirty, fromr which he learn-&#xD;
ed that' time had made sad havoc in the beauty of the orig-..&#xD;
inal. His wandering eye was recalled to the old gentleman,&#xD;
who asked,'&#xD;
"Have you any means, sir ?"&#xD;
"None~ but my profession, which is a fortune if it is pros-&#xD;
ecuted with perseverance and. industry."&#xD;
Industry-industry. Ah! there's the rub. The young&#xD;
fools nowadays, who have~ means instead of adding, seem&#xD;
bent -on spending; and' they who have none expect manna&#xD;
from 'heaven, or 'ravens 'from' 'the desert; to feed 'them.&#xD;
Things didn't use to go devilward at the he~idloxmg i~ate they&#xD;
go now. I hope, my boy, your grandfather'didn't transmit&#xD;
any thing btit his name to his progeny.' "Ha lived ~s if the~&#xD;

money is the omnipotent power in this worldwas altogether&#xD;
urtob.~erved ~by him. I hope you take your qualities from&#xD;
your mother's family."&#xD;
Drayton was~much perplexed, and did not know what an-&#xD;
swer to return; but, after a'moment's hesitation, he said, "I&#xD;
suspect, sir, I inherit the peculiarities of both my father's and&#xD;
mother's families, as I have a strong desire to accumulate,&#xD;
and one equally strong to expend. Money is a most useful&#xD;
and necessary slave, but a most unmerciful god."&#xD;
"Ah, yes, 1 see how' it is, very clearly," said the uncle,&#xD;
shaking his head up and down with a most peculiar solem..&#xD;
nity, which indicated a suspicion that his nephew's case was&#xD;
most desperate and incurable. "It is a great pity that so&#xD;
good-looking a fellow-..one who has the old-fashioned Mac-&#xD;
donald eye-....one whom one would expect better things of-.&#xD;
should be as muoh of a Brayton in his nature as he is in his&#xD;
name. 'Unmerciful God,' indeed! 'Yes, that's a sentiment&#xD;
worthy of your grandfathers Yes, sir, I see clearly that you&#xD;
are a chip of the old block !" -&#xD;
The old gentleman uttered a deep sigh as the fancied de-&#xD;
generacy of the Draytop. family expanded before him. Wish-&#xD;
ing to stand as fair as possible with his uncle, Drayton re-&#xD;
marked,&#xD;
"I. beg you not to misunderstand me. I have a very&#xD;
strong inclination to make money; at the same time, I am&#xD;
not the minion of avarice. Money can procure a great max~y&#xD;
comforts and conveniOnces' that I desire, and therefore it is&#xD;
my design to ~strain eveiy honest nerve in ~its acquisition.&#xD;
Although, if I thought that the accumulation of money would&#xD;
have the effect on me which 1 have known it. to h~ve in&#xD;
many inst~uees; making: men perfect Ishmaelites among hu-&#xD;
man cha.r5ties, I would most fervently pray for poverty as&#xD;
the greatest blessing, and 'strive to enjoy in the accumula-&#xD;
tion ~f .tliotrghts the happiness which ethers feel in the&#xD;
amassment of dollars~"&#xD;
"Well, thai* Heaven: !" said the .doctor, "I was born in&#xD;
better times, else I too might have been a fool like most of&#xD;
th~ young men of this day; and in. that case, instead of liv-&#xD;
ing as I want to live, I might have been the tenant of a&#xD;

money. Every thing in this world has its price, from a.&#xD;
woman or a patriot down to the rope, which most young&#xD;
men would become very familiar with if they had their de-&#xD;
serts. Wealth is sunshine-poverty is midnight. Why,&#xD;
hark ye, my boy," continued the doctor, ~poking the ivory&#xD;
head of his cane against Drayton's ribs, "hark ye, my boy,&#xD;
I never even take a trip of pleasure without contriving by&#xD;
some means to make my expenses~ That's the way-that's&#xD;
the way, boy !" and the old gentleman chuckled with great&#xD;
glee as he dwelt on his own money-making powers.&#xD;
A momentary silence ensued, which was broken by Dray-&#xD;
ton, who observed,&#xD;
"Money will not purchase peace of mind while we live,&#xD;
nor the hope of immortal bliss beyond the tomb. It will not&#xD;
purchase honor and fame, nor-"&#xD;
"Honor is breath, and fame a bubble," exclaimed the doc-&#xD;
tor, in a tone denoting impatience. "Which is the nobler&#xD;
pursuit-to struggle for honor, which is a~ unsubstantial as&#xD;
the dream of an infant, or a large interest in stocks that&#xD;
yield ten per cent. in semi-annual dividends? Ten per cents.,&#xD;
my boy, are the best friends one ever finds in this world;&#xD;
and therefore take my advice, 'and try to get them, and let&#xD;
honor and fame go to the dogs."&#xD;
While the doctor was speaking, a miserable-looking girl,&#xD;
whose tattered and filthy garments covered a very deformed&#xD;
person, entered and commenced a broken appeal to' their char-&#xD;
itie~. The old gentleman shook his cane at her and' ordered&#xD;
her off, which mandate she'f9rthwith obeyed, brushing a tear&#xD;
from her eye as she left the 'room. Drayton pitied her, and,&#xD;
following' her into the hall, put a piece of money into her&#xD;
hands. When he returned)' the doctor laughed at him, and&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"You'aregreen~~. Don't' be gulled by any of these&#xD;
pests. There are plenty of poor-houses for such ~creatures.&#xD;
Why, sir, if you had a. million, and were to' give whenever&#xD;
called on, you' would' soon be compelled to beg yourself.~ Be~&#xD;

Drayton wa~ amazed, and fancied that if at that moment&#xD;
his uncle could have removed all the misery from the human&#xD;
family, and introduced the millennial reign over the benighted&#xD;
states of the world,~. by the expenditure'of one tenth of his&#xD;
possessions, he would not have done it. While he was spec-&#xD;
ulating on the havoc which avarice makes among the holier&#xD;
feelings of our nature, the doctor asked him if he had yet been&#xD;
trying to procure an office.&#xD;
"No, sir," replied Drayton. "' I thought I would consult&#xD;
wiih you first."&#xD;
"Well, I have a row of them, and one has been vacant for&#xD;
the last month. You can have it for a small rent, and the&#xD;
stands a good one for a lawyer. The last scoundrel who oc-&#xD;
cupied it was an itinerant portrait painter, who ran 'away&#xD;
without paying a dollar for it. Have you practiced any at&#xD;
the bar yet ?"&#xD;
"No, sir. There were too many old lawyers in our sec-&#xD;
tion, and I thought it wise to emigrate."&#xD;
"Egad! there are too many every where," ejaculated the&#xD;
doctor; "but, then, the rascality that abounds in every com-'&#xD;
munity makes the presence of great numbers of your voca-&#xD;
'tion necessary. You have made your maiden speech, I sup-'&#xD;
pose ?"&#xD;
"' No, sir."&#xD;
"Then you are not satisfied that you possess even the raw&#xD;
materials of a successful lawyer ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I am satisfied on that point," replied' Drayton,&#xD;
speaking positively. "I feel confident that, if affair, oppor-&#xD;
tunity is afforded me, I can succeed. I know I have mind&#xD;
enough 'to comprehend and understand every subject that is&#xD;
intelligible, and I have strong and quick feeling, and the pow-&#xD;
er of uttering my thoughts."&#xD;
"Sense is not so necessary as tact iii a lawyer," said the&#xD;
doctor. "The men 'who~ make the most money are your&#xD;
shrewd, managing fellows, who don't care for abstractions.&#xD;
If a subject is at all cloudy or intricate, they only guess at&#xD;
it. Your metaphysical lawyer puzzles himself, judges, and'&#xD;
~juries ~by running out plain principles into the regions of&#xD;
nonsense and absurdity; :wh'ereas your lawyer who has tact~&#xD;
has the faculty of extracting big fees from the, purses of his&#xD;
cli~ftts in. compensation for small services. Intellect is a&#xD;
secondary consideration. Tact is the most skillfiui of pick-&#xD;
pockets, and hasfa knack of insinuating its fingers ~into all&#xD;
purses."         '             '  '   '&#xD;

£ "But such zneu are mere pettifoggers," said Drayton.&#xD;
"Law is a noble scienCe, and they make a mere trade of it.&#xD;
At the same time that I was striving to get a rich fee, I&#xD;
would not be altogether unsolicitous about my reputation."&#xD;
"There it is again," exclaimed the old gentleman, an-&#xD;
noyed by what he considered his nephew's indifference to&#xD;
money. "That word reputation will strangle you yet, if you&#xD;
are not careful. You take the money, and let the devil take&#xD;
the reputation. Look well to the main chance, and don't&#xD;
talk or think any more of fame, and honor, and other un-&#xD;
meaning sounds. When you get rich you can afford what a.&#xD;
poor man can not, that is, you can afford to procure a little&#xD;
luxury in the shape of reputation. At best, fame is the bait&#xD;
that fancy sets to catch fools with. Don't you be caught on&#xD;
such a pin hook, my boy."&#xD;
The , conversation was here interrupted by the entrance&#xD;
of a gentleman, whose commanding exterior elicited Dray-&#xD;
ton's adini:ration. He was apparently fifty-five years of&#xD;
age, tall, and well formed, although very slender. His hair&#xD;
was gray, and, being bald in front, he made up the defi-&#xD;
ciency by wearing a long cue behind. The features which&#xD;
particularly struck a stranger were ~. lively black eye and&#xD;
beautiful mouth; the former indicating intellect, and the&#xD;
latter amiability. These features gave character and beau-&#xD;
ty to his face, rendering it exceedingly fascinating, and wiu~&#xD;
fling from all observers a confidence in the moral and intel-&#xD;
lectual superiority of the man. As he entered the room,&#xD;
the 'doctor rubbed his hands together, while his eyes sparkled&#xD;
with delight, thereby evincing to the new-coiner the pleas-&#xD;
ure with which he was welcomed. He shook his visitor's&#xD;
hand cordially, saying,&#xD;
"Ah, colonel, how do you do? I ant very glad to see&#xD;
you~ Take a seat, and give an account of yourself." And&#xD;
here, observing that the colonel's eye was directed toward&#xD;
Dx~ayton, he continued; "That gentleman is the son of a&#xD;
favorite niece of mine, and 'has come among us to practice&#xD;
law-Mr. Drayton, a grandson of a gentleman of the same&#xD;
name, whom you once knew. Mr. Drayton, Colonel Charles&#xD;
Meredith."&#xD;
The colonel welcomed D~ayton, and then sat dowu on&#xD;
the other side of the doctor, who commenced detailing suti-&#xD;
dry afflictions that had befallen, him' since they last~ met.&#xD;
When ~he had finished, the colonel turned to Draylon and&#xD;
said&#xD;
&#xD;

~' And. so yen are the grandson ~f Mr. Draytwi. I was too&#xD;
ywiug te know him personally, though I remember seeing&#xD;
aiim fr~queutly at the~ house of my father, from whom I&#xD;
*     have learned many interesting and some romantic incidents&#xD;
touching his career. My father still lives, in his eightieth&#xD;
year, with. me, and I know he would be glad to see a grand-&#xD;
son of one with whom the recollections of his early years are&#xD;
so intimately associated. You must visit us, Mr. D;rayton.&#xD;
We occupy~ the house formerly in possession of your family.&#xD;
I have a son 'who glories in the fact that he wa~ born on&#xD;
the day wheu our' nation's independence was first proclaim.&#xD;
ed; and he, too, will be happy to see you, and. ~will do' all&#xD;
he can to entertain you."&#xD;
Drayton thanked him for his proffered kindness and hos-&#xD;
pitality, and observed that, as he was a student, he would&#xD;
not be able to visit much, but that, before he recoinmenced&#xD;
his studies, he would visit him at Oakwood.&#xD;
"You mean to become a member of our bar, Mr. Dray-&#xD;
ton ?" said the colonel. "Well, sir, it is very respectable in&#xD;
talent. You will' find men adorning it who to va.st legal&#xD;
acquirements add extensive information in science, classic-&#xD;
al and general literature. It is just such a bar as aflibrds&#xD;
the best school and theater for a young man of genius and&#xD;
ambition: I formerly practiced at it, but have now entire-&#xD;
*      ly relinquished the practice. I still love to revive interesting&#xD;
recollections connected with the profession by occasionally&#xD;
visiting the court-house, and discussing points with some of&#xD;
my old friends and competitors.. When you visit me at Oak-&#xD;
wood, I may probably be aide to entertain you by giving you&#xD;
sketches of some of the characters and incidents in the lives&#xD;
of some of the most distinguished rriember~ of the profession.&#xD;
Our country, Mr. Drayton,' can boast of having produced&#xD;
more great lawyers within the last fifty years than any oth-&#xD;
er country, With many of the most~emmneut of these men&#xD;
it hasL been my good fortune to meet; but I 'must not speak&#xD;
of them now. It is astonishing, doctor, how the old, habits&#xD;
adhere to us. Although I have not made a speech at the&#xD;
bar for ten years, yet, whenever I happen to be thei~e, I feel a&#xD;
very strong inclination to Jift up my voice in favor of ~uffer~&#xD;
ing innocence, or to assist in fa$ening the charge of guilt on&#xD;
*      some slip~pery scoundrel. I suppose you also take delight in:&#xD;
feeling s~' feverish pulse .y~t, aiid fancy you have not lost&#xD;
ybur forrr~er expertness in relieving, afflicted. humanity of&#xD;
the burden of its sorrows. You still think the prettiest cat~~.&#xD;
&#xD;
aract in uatur.e is formed by a. stream of blood, and the death-&#xD;
rattle exquisitely musical."&#xD;
"Oh yes, 'sir, IL still think the lancet the most beautiful&#xD;
weapon in the World., and am not' indifferent to my skill in&#xD;
using it. You spoke of the strength of old habits, coloneL&#xD;
Our neighbor, Dick Woods, whom you recollect as the best&#xD;
shoemaker in town, told me, some time ago, that he still&#xD;
continued to make all the shoes used in his family; and&#xD;
Dick, you know, is now very rich, and far above the neces-&#xD;
sity of laboring."&#xD;
"I do not think I shall ever follow the example of Mr.&#xD;
Dick Woods," said Drayton, laughing, "for I most sincerely&#xD;
hope I may never see a last or a lapstone agQ.in." Here&#xD;
Drayton observed a frown darkening his uncle's brow; and&#xD;
recollecting his recent instruction relative t~ his former inti-&#xD;
macy with the implements of that useful vocation, instead&#xD;
of saying what he at first intended, he remarked that there&#xD;
was no occupation 10.4 fitted to develop and expand the in-&#xD;
tellectual powers than shoemaking, notwithstanding Hans&#xD;
Sachs, Bloomfield, Sherman, and others had found time,&#xD;
while practicing it, to prosecute studies by means of which&#xD;
they had afterward risen to eminence.&#xD;
"There is no condition from which superior genius will&#xD;
not rise," said the colonel. "The eagle can spread his&#xD;
wings and soar from the sod of the valley as well as from&#xD;
the beetling clifTh which overlook the ocean's expanse. Ge-&#xD;
nius seeks its native skies, whether its home be the hovel&#xD;
or the palace. Such men, like Sampson, break all the cords&#xD;
that bind other men to earth, and the pack-threads of cir-&#xD;
cumstances are to them but as the web which the spider&#xD;
weaves by night on the wings of the condor. Pile up ob-&#xD;
stacles as high as Pelion on the energies of a. man of true&#xD;
genius, and his native strength will enable him to throw off&#xD;
the mountain and lift his disencumbered head toward the&#xD;
heavens which smile upon it. And here in this land, where&#xD;
the will 'of man is as free as the wing of the swallow, we&#xD;
have demonstrated the great truth, that happy is the coun-&#xD;
try in which genius, and not hereditary right, governs."&#xD;
As th~ colonel spoke, Drayton regarded him with a look&#xD;
of profound admiration. ~lis words seemed but an echo&#xD;
from the voice of his own faith, and implied the truth of the&#xD;
dream which had enc1iante~1 him through the long and weary&#xD;
hours of many an unkind night. Musical are the songs of&#xD;
birds, the falling of water, and the, wl4sperings of the winds&#xD;

&#xD;
to the ear of the true poet; and musical, indeed~ are the&#xD;
tones of woman's lip in the ear of her lover; but de5rer far&#xD;
is a word of encouragement from the man of experience to&#xD;
the heart of the young aspirant who has yet but dreamed&#xD;
of the battle-fields of ambition, for which his soul yearns as&#xD;
the 'i' hart pants for the water-brooks." As the colonel spoke,&#xD;
Drayton's memory flittedlike a wild bird back to the brooks,&#xD;
and groves, ana plants sacred to his heart, the scenes of the&#xD;
studies and dreams of his former years, and then, in the&#xD;
next moment, his soul seemed to spring upward to the sum-&#xD;
mit of the arch of' fame, which spanned, like a brilliant rain-&#xD;
bow, the dark clouds that threatened the cherished hope of&#xD;
his heart with storm and desolation.&#xD;
"And that country in which mind governs is not only&#xD;
blessed in its rulers, but also in the increased happiness of&#xD;
its citizens," said Drayton, while his eye flashed with en-&#xD;
thusiasm. "It is not the hand of patronage, but the liberty&#xD;
to act as its impulses incline it, that the mind, d0~ssed by&#xD;
poverty and untoward circumstances, needs. W~i~n the su-&#xD;
perior mind frees itself from the pack-threads of 'which you&#xD;
spoke, it draws the glittering sword and fights its way upward&#xD;
to the heights whieh only the few ever reach. And, then, is&#xD;
not the view from 1~he loftiest eminences ample remunera-&#xD;
tion for the labor of climbing? Who that, once having risen&#xD;
to the summit, loathes his elevation, and sighs again for the&#xD;
shade and the valley which lie in the distance below him?"&#xD;
"I don't wonder at you, my boy," said the doctor, look-&#xD;
ing ~.t' Draytoit's animated face, over which the rays of many&#xD;
briU~ut thonglits werO flashing; "but really, colonel, your&#xD;
enthusiasm about bubbles is strange. For a man of your&#xD;
experience to be talking in favor of chasing shadows, aston-&#xD;
~slies me. You ought long since to have learned the supe-&#xD;
rier value of a substance. How many men live only' to&#xD;
'cheat themselves out of the comforts they might be enjoy-&#xD;
ing!' Some delude themselves upon religious subjects; some&#xD;
go mad when they get in love; and others are wrong-head-&#xD;
ed about honor and fame."&#xD;
"And some delude themselves by placing a fictitious val-&#xD;
tie on money," added the colonel, while the. doctor was shak-&#xD;
fl3g~ his head gravely.' "You think, ~ny dear doctor, that&#xD;
Spenser's Fa~ry QAleen is a very silly book, and~ yet how&#xD;
many thousands have been made happy in its perusal! We,&#xD;
who are in the habit of speculating and indulging in fan-&#xD;

"'AU ~ve khow of'existenc~ is confined to this world,"~'ro-'&#xD;
turned: th~ doctor, "and every bo4y knows 'that it is a very,&#xD;

"In a very few days, '1 hope," answered&#xD;

When the colonel was gone, the doctor grew ~rcry moody, ~&#xD;

upon the spirit, and we be haunted by the phautom- of de~&#xD;
spair. ~3ut ulas! it too frequently happens that the one "who&#xD;
seemed to us as undefiled as the breath of an angel, de-&#xD;
ceives us, and we turn away sick and bowed down in sor-&#xD;
row. We lift up our heads like the swaying reed when the&#xD;
storm is gone, 2and, less confiding,- turn to another o1~ject&#xD;
which seems truer to us, and live over our former experi-&#xD;
ence. Again and again we trust our hopes to ~tha treach-&#xD;
erou0 wave, and are again and. again wrecked. , Our dream&#xD;
of, life is darkened; the rainbow has lost its beauty, arid-the&#xD;
songs of birds their. sweetness, aiid we stand stricken mourn-&#xD;
ers at the tomb of the hope that dazzled but tomislead, that&#xD;
rose in glory to set in- tears and agony. Careless 'for a while&#xD;

Bet14~eAi 4rhich we had scarcely dared expect on this side&#xD;
of lieww~en.&#xD;
Much' like -this had been Drayton's experience, and simi-&#xD;
lar to - it is that'of- most imaginative persons.. His feelings&#xD;
were ardent, and in early youth he had yearned for that&#xD;
sympathy ~hioh man seeks for in vain among his fellows,&#xD;
and finds only in the bosom of the one. Fountains had&#xD;
&#xD;
poured~ forth their cryst~al~raters in the desert about huin,,&#xD;
but thay'2had' turned -to- bitterness on hi~Alp. The perfect~&#xD;
tions with which his imagination had invested -several oh~'&#xD;
jects toward whom his affection had been~ strong; had oiie&#xD;
by one fallen from- his heart's ~d~Th; and- he had more than&#xD;
once awakened from dreams; brief but birilliant-to fi~id that&#xD;
he had' laid -the deVotion- of his spirit on worthless altars.&#xD;
Disap~6inted. repeatedly, he had of late'held but little inter-&#xD;
course with the sex, whieh~however it had disappointed hixn&#xD;
he still adored, and had given his 1r~4t to 'ambition and 'the&#xD;
visions of fame.- It was 'deeply xnysferious- to him why. thc&#xD;
lady whom he had' seen fort a moment in the street, where&#xD;
all were' strangers, had again swayed the scepter of 'love.&#xD;
over the slumbering tides of passion. A thousand others,&#xD;
many of whom were beautiful, had passed him, and he' had&#xD;
admired them, but this one alone exerted a- singular' influ.~&#xD;
ence over him. Had he at length 'found the long-sQught&#xD;
boon, and w&amp;amp;s his admiration of female 'loveliness td be grat-&#xD;
ified? He passed on) revolving many problaxns~ an&amp;amp; won~&#xD;
during who she could be who had thus affected him. He&#xD;
went by 'the house he had seen her enter, but she was not&#xD;
visible; and, still dreaming of her-dark eye, he returned to&#xD;
the tavern~ and gave himself up to~ delicious reveries.&#xD;
In the afternoon lie started off to look at the office his&#xD;
uncle had, offered him, taking care to pass the house which&#xD;
the lady, of whom he' was dreaming, entered in the morn-&#xD;
ing. Smiling ~at his own credulity, he weutto the office.&#xD;
It was near the center 'of-a row 'of a' dozen one-story build-&#xD;
ings) which the old gentleman l~a~I put up on speculation.&#xD;
They rented readily; but w&amp;amp;e pAici~ially occupied by tran-&#xD;

ing elo~jnent~ of a. speech he had juat made, and, ])rayton&#xD;

served, them for a short time; and then left t~he pl~a ~&#xD;
ulating on what he deemed to be their ch~rae~rers 'a&#xD;

sifting as he had left him in the morning. Soon' after lIe&#xD;
took his seat, the doctor told him' he could have the of~lce' b~&#xD;
paying twelve dollars a month for it.&#xD;
"I will take it, sir," said ]~rayton, "although X fear I&#xD;
shall not be able to be the most punctual of tenants for&#xD;
some time."&#xD;
"I will do any thing that's reasonable for you," said'- thei&#xD;
doctor,. with a very amiable' expression of face, "but 1 must&#xD;

"I hope, sir," said Drayton, smiling, "that I shall not be&#xD;
forced to follow the example of my predecessor, and 'leave&#xD;
the premises 'in very unpleasant haste."&#xD;
"You will have a strange set of neighbors," said the un-&#xD;
cle, deliberately, as 'he tapped his snuff-box and adminis-&#xD;

nose. "They will afford- you an excellent opportunity' for&#xD;

my boy, you never dreamed that persons such as live in that&#xD;

The conversation. was continued for some time, and when&#xD;
Drayton was. gone the old gentleman leaned his cheek on&#xD;
the head of his cane and thought. He was much addicted&#xD;
to uttering his thoughts When no one was near to overhear&#xD;
him. ~He shook his head frequently as he muttered,&#xD;
"That 'young fellow is a precious fool-a very precious&#xD;

Here a silence ensued for a moment, when the doctor&#xD;
broke it by roaring out in a stentrian voice, "Johu-.-.Tohn&#xD;
-oh, John !"&#xD;
A yellow fellow with a shining face, and locke combed out&#xD;
to their. fill extent, flaring in every direction, soon made hi~&#xD;
appea~anee at the- door. The doctor frowned on him a mu-&#xD;
ment, and said,&#xD;
"What's the reasQ~1 it takes you all day to come when I&#xD;
call you? Get a tumbler, fill it half full of brandy, put&#xD;

The servant did as ordered, and the doctor, after imbib-&#xD;

handkerchief over his face to protect it from the flies, and&#xD;
was soon asleep.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
~A~WOOP, t~he reside&amp;amp; of Colonel Meredith, was a few&#xD;
miles from the city. It was one of the most desirable situ-&#xD;
a+,ions in that section of the state. The house was built of&#xD;
stone, two stories high, with a~ wide and spaeioi~ hail trav-&#xD;
ersing the center, on either side of which were suites.'of.~o6ms&#xD;
of ample dimensions. It had been erected a century lerore&#xD;
it came juto the colonel's possession, ax~d now presented a&#xD;
venerable expect. The rude storms of more than a hundred&#xD;
years had left distinct traces behind in the blackened ap-&#xD;
pearairee of the stone, visible wherever the- eye rested. - A&#xD;
porch. ran along the entire front of the house, about which a&#xD;
great variety of vines clustei~, interweaving their tendrils,&#xD;
~nd affordi~zg a delightful shade~ On the gradually ~to~ing&#xD;
swa-rd a variety of trees cast *heir shadows, . among which&#xD;
*       the- cliii. and the oak were cons  lions, raising their iriajestic&#xD;
heads, like stalwart giants, toward the heavens-the only&#xD;
remnants of a mighty forest, in'whi4~h- the red man and the&#xD;
deer ~had roved before the foot of enterprise had invaded the&#xD;
&#xD;
1XI~AYT        -            -33&#xD;
soP. On the right, ~, 4wi~ht      4istance, flowed the&#xD;
river, with islands of grept picture e'~s gemming -its sur~&#xD;
face; and on the left ri~hizzg from near the -house to the'&#xD;
road, extended a long lane bordered by trees., This situation&#xD;
possessed great beauty,:and the improvements which the cob&#xD;
onel had made displayed refined bzste and a studied attention&#xD;
to comfort.&#xD;
The house, one of the most ancient in that section, was -&#xD;
built by an English gentleman, who was sent out to-this coun-&#xD;
try by his government while these states were British colo-&#xD;
nies. At his death it was purchased by -Drayton's grand-&#xD;
father, who soon involved the estate in. debt by a course of&#xD;
wild hospitality and prodigality. He sold it to clear himself&#xD;
of the legal perplexities into which his reckless career had.&#xD;
plunged him, and died in the prime of his manhood, insolvent,&#xD;
loved and pitied by all his acquaintances. In course of time,&#xD;
the estate passed into the possession of OoloxielMeredith, who&#xD;
made sundry improvements on it, and einbelli~hed the -inte-&#xD;
rior with busts, pictures, and statues, which indicated a high-&#xD;
ly cultivated taste, not very prevalent in our country at that&#xD;
period.&#xD;
A few days after Drayton had met the colonel at his un-&#xD;
cle's, he procured a. horse and started for Oak~vood. When&#xD;
he arrived within sight of the mansion, he thought of the&#xD;
sage advice given him by his uncle touching the matrimo~&#xD;
nial alliance with Miss Meredith, by which lie was to appro-&#xD;
priate the - estate of his ancestors. Now, although he was -&#xD;
one of the last persons in the world who would have jbarter-&#xD;
ed away his affections, yet there was something in the prop-&#xD;
ositjon which-~niote his fancy, and he hoped that the lady&#xD;
in question~ i~dght be one whom he could love independently&#xD;
of all pecuniary considerations. He wondered what resem-&#xD;
blance Ellen bore 4o the lady whose image still lingered on&#xD;
his memory, and on which he dwelt with more fondness than.&#xD;
he would have been willing to disclose. He amused him-&#xD;
self as he jode along by forming an ideal of Miss Meredith's-&#xD;
appearance, and imagining many very delightful scenes in&#xD;
her company, which he supposed. strictly within the liinit~&#xD;
of possibility. Thus, alternately speculating ou the incident~&#xD;
tha.t might befall him, and. g~la~ncing on the beauties of the&#xD;
landscape, he approached th~house and alighted. As he&#xD;
walked toward the porch lie discovered the tall form and&#xD;
manly face of the colonel, standing ready to receive him.&#xD;
The hearty grasp Qf the hand, and the glad greeting e~f lip&#xD;

and eye, assured' him ofhis welcome,"&amp;amp;~id he felt himself at&#xD;
home in an instant.&#xD;
The 'colonel's son, George Meredith, now made his appear-&#xD;
ance, and extended to' Drayton a most cordial welcome. He&#xD;
was a pale and delicate young man of five-and-twenty years~&#xD;
His forehead was broad, bold, and high, and shaded by long,&#xD;
thin waving locks of a deep auburn hue. The quick hazel&#xD;
eye, whose glances were wild and restless, and at times in-&#xD;
tensely searching, and the mouth, from which radiated all&#xD;
the fascination of his father's, won the admiration of every&#xD;
observer of character. He was tall anA very thin, and there&#xD;
was every appearance about him oPan infirm physical con-&#xD;
st~tution wedded with great intellectual power. His health&#xD;
had been frail since boyhood, and his friends had 'many mis-&#xD;
givirigs 'when they contemplated the wasted cheek, sunken&#xD;
eye~ and narrow chest of this most noble youth. Rare, indeed,&#xD;
is it to find one like him,~who has the power of interesting&#xD;
all, from 'the glad and buoyant boy who would visit him to&#xD;
inquire 'about his health, and to bring him some present from&#xD;
mother or~ sister, tp the hoary-headed traveler along life's&#xD;
thoroughfares, who would-~ forget his own decrepitude' in&#xD;
George's presence, and go away' reluctantly, with' the soft&#xD;
arid drean~i-like tones of his voice ringing in his delighted ear.&#xD;
He 1~a&amp;amp;a 'kind word and a gladdening smile for every One,&#xD;
and every one,~ when in his. presence, forgot that humaii na-&#xD;
ture has much that we hate blended with 'better qualities,&#xD;
and seemed to be contented with dwelling with satisfaction&#xD;
on this unalloyed combination of 'all that is noble in mind&#xD;
and morals.&#xD;
George Meredith's mind was brilliant with the jewelry&#xD;
of poetic thoughts. He loved' Nature as a kind and benefi-&#xD;
cent mother, from whom flowed a thousand streams of hap-&#xD;
piness, and on whose bosom it was delightful to lie and gaze&#xD;
upon tree, and star, and 'clouds, forgetting that life has a.&#xD;
care, and. dreaming of delights as if time never shadowed&#xD;
such visions. Spring and autumn, and bird and brook,"were&#xD;
the smi~1es of old friends for him; and often had his smitten&#xD;
heart poured forth its love for them, in strains which proved&#xD;
the depth of his devotion. Throughout his career, he had&#xD;
wanted that' robustness of health which enables one to par-&#xD;
ticipate joyously in the excitements of society; but he had&#xD;
found an ample remuneration for such loss in those mute&#xD;
and glorious companions of the gifted mind, the books that&#xD;
the intellectual lords of our race have bequeathed to the by-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
g&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.                      35&#xD;
ers of high thought~ through all generations. Deeply he&#xD;
drank at those refreshing fountains-so deeply, indeed, that&#xD;
many of his friends feared that his devotion to literary pur-.&#xD;
suits made feebler a feeble constitution, and attenuated. the&#xD;
chords that bound his spirit to its frail tabernacle of flesh.&#xD;
An infirmitj of physical constitution often suggests to the&#xD;
mind courses of action not generally relied on fcri enjoyment&#xD;
by those of more robust frames, and leads its victim to the&#xD;
imperishable records of genius as a means of diverting it&#xD;
from its own afflictions. When the common sources of&#xD;
amusement are denied, the active spirit, panting for relief&#xD;
from the sense of its bondage, turns to nature, and in its&#xD;
worship of the beautiful and the true, the sea, the stars, and&#xD;
the everlasting mountains, finds a substitute for the grosse~&#xD;
pursuits to which the great majority of our species devote&#xD;
themselves, ~ And these afflicted ones generally learn from&#xD;
their own sufferings the necessity of cherishing a nearer syrn-&#xD;
pathy with the miseries of their fellows than is often enter.&#xD;
tamed by persons of robust health, and this gives to them a&#xD;
delicacy and softness ~f manner by no means common to men.&#xD;
Swift remarks that he never knew a lady who was very~&#xD;
deserving who had not too much reason to complain of ilL&#xD;
health, and the remark has a meaning applicable to bc~th&#xD;
sexes, though its truthfulness is distorted by the cynicism of&#xD;
its author.&#xD;
Pure and holy beyond all imagining was the love ~rhich&#xD;
Ellen Meredith cherished for her brother; and with a devo-&#xD;
tion such as woman only feels, she had watched with the&#xD;
most unslumbering vigilance over him during those 'hours&#xD;
when the hand of affliction bore heavily ,on him. 'In a.&#xD;
thousand instances she had denied herself social pleasures&#xD;
that she might be by the side of George, cheering the weary&#xD;
hours of suffering. She would soothe the anguish of his fe-&#xD;
vered brow with her soft hand, and read to him from the&#xD;
works of the masters of E~nglish verse, hour after hour, with-&#xD;
out dreaming she was making a sacrifice of her own pleas.&#xD;
ure. I~etween their minds there was much conge~iiality, and&#xD;
in reading and in conversation of a superior kind they were&#xD;
mutually delighted. If there is ~ne spectacle more, than all&#xD;
others calculated to raise our hearts from the earth, and to&#xD;
inspire us with a higher regard for oi~ir species, certainly it&#xD;
is where a sister and brother, ~,s closely connected in spirit&#xD;
and thought as in blood, devote themselves to each other's&#xD;
interests with the ~iost unselfish and unwavering regard~&#xD;

George Meredith had all the nervous e*oitability~ common&#xD;
to young men of poetical temperament and infirm constitu-&#xD;
tio~ His perceptions were remarkably.,aeute, and he would&#xD;
detect a nun sequitur in an argument as readily as a beauty&#xD;
in a landscape. In conversation he wi~s ~lways'earnest,' and,&#xD;
when e~rcited, his enthusia~xn sometimes bordered on wild-&#xD;
ness, lie uttered his thoughts wi~ at facility, and high-&#xD;
wrought 'irnage~ came from his 4~ naturally as forms of&#xD;
beauty burst from the summer ev - clouds.:&#xD;
As the conversation went on, Drayton had azi. opportunity&#xD;
of observing~ his companions more closely. There was much&#xD;
in George ~Ieredith's face and manner which deeply inter-&#xD;
ested The eye, so dreamy in its gaze, so wild and rest-&#xD;
lessin its was the feature on which he dwelt with&#xD;
peculiar a4niiration.. Miss Meredith seemed to him to be&#xD;
the least interesting person in company. She was most de..&#xD;
cidedly not handsome, and sat with her eye cast down on a&#xD;
ribbon which she was twirling in her fingers~&#xD;
"Have you ~pent much of your life in the country ?" asked&#xD;
George, directing his conversation to Drayton.&#xD;
"I have always lived in a small town,'~ replied Drayton;&#xD;
"hut my visits to the country were frequent, though rarely&#xD;
exceeding a day at a time. I love the country, however,&#xD;
and suspect that, by visiting it only occasionally, I relish its&#xD;
beauties more than if I were a constant dweller among them,&#xD;
for familiarity with objects generally cheapens them in our&#xD;
estimation,"&#xD;
"Your remark is true of the works of man, but not of&#xD;
those of God," returned George, and his eye kindled as he&#xD;
spoke. "To the ho~.rt that loves Nature, a familiarity with&#xD;
all.. the'a~pects ~he presents, from the flowers and foliage&#xD;
of spring to the frosts and bleakness of winter, brings 'no&#xD;
weariness. The face of Nature,.like the face of a beautiful&#xD;
woman, never tires the irisio~'; and every expression, every&#xD;
change that passes over it;. deepens the spell we feel in her&#xD;
presence; Beauty is more highly prized the more we dwell&#xD;
on it, as the devotion of the s.ajnt is deepened by constant&#xD;
medit&amp;amp;tions on heaven. The ehil4reu of Israel used to go&#xD;
up to Jerusalem once a year, and that is better policy than&#xD;
that enjoined by Islamism, which requires but one pilgrim-&#xD;
* age during life to th0 tomb of the Prophet. The astronomer&#xD;

waveless calm of their souls. They4ura from a thrice-seen&#xD;

~ble deor~a is that':! .--..that I must pluiige into the&#xD;
midst of exciteimien here, among conflicting audi tu-&#xD;
rnultuous elements, I xiiust sink or' swim~ I should grow&#xD;
restless in the solitude of the country, for my fancy would be&#xD;
busy with the crowd of~the city. Perhaps this fa~t of my&#xD;
being may lessen my love' and reverence for Nature, but it&#xD;
~doea not exile my heart from her presence."&#xD;
"&amp;amp;ciety for the man of talent, but solitude for, the son of&#xD;
genius," said George, with his eye glancing from Drayton's&#xD;
face to the gray hill in the distance. "Among gay andfes-&#xD;
tive scenes, genius frequently becomes enamored of the am&#xD;
pause it wins, and forgets what is due its lofty 'aspirations,&#xD;
tending ever upward to an exalted4estiny. The excitements&#xD;
of the crowd shadow the 'mind's mirroring power, which, when&#xD;
undimmed, reflects all that is beautiful in earth and sky, and&#xD;
all that is true of heaven and man. Genius neglects its true&#xD;
vocation when it suffers the dust of the ~common thorough.&#xD;
fares to weigh heavily On its pinions, which were designed to&#xD;
fan the pure air of the upper sides. Look at the recent in-&#xD;
stance of Scotland's best poet, poor Burns! If he had remain-&#xD;
ed by the banks of the Ayr, ignorant of social., excitements,&#xD;
he would have gone on adding to the strength of his intel-&#xD;
lect in his solitary communings with nature, and he might&#xD;
still be among men, standing beside his 'competitors, for the&#xD;
laurel, a giant in mind, with the thoughts that bring rOnown&#xD;
flashing on his God-like brow."&#xD;
'~ I suspect, my dear. son," said Colonel Meredith, "that&#xD;
there is no important difference between your opinions and&#xD;
those of our friend Mr. Drayton. "Different minds require&#xD;
different alinients. Such a man as Cewper' would' fr~t'b~~&#xD;
self to death in a crowd, while a Chathi~m would languish&#xD;
in solitude. The serene mind of the one finds its ap~ropri-&#xD;
ate food in contemplating the works of nature~ .while the&#xD;
restless soul of the other, in tossing on the agitated sea of hu-'&#xD;

"I- am peifeotl-y aware," returned George, with great 4ef&#xD;
erenceto his- father, "that I, like every one else, in reason-&#xD;
ing, am apt to take my own nature as the standard, and,&#xD;
therefore, what I say, however true it m&amp;amp;y -be in relation to&#xD;
myself~ may be wholly inapplicable to those of diff~renttem-&#xD;
perameuts. It is - natural," he continued, warming and he.&#xD;
coming more enthusiastic as he went on, "that I should pre-&#xD;
fer the companionship of Nature to the crowd, for ~very pub&#xD;
satin of my heart is as true to her al's the lover's to his idol;&#xD;
and, -like a chivalrous knight of the olden time, I am. willing&#xD;
to do battle in vindication of the pre-eminent charms of my&#xD;
mistress in every court in Christendom. - Well do I remem-&#xD;
ber how often my spirit grew weary when at college I was&#xD;
imprisoned in walls, and the ceaseless hum of a multitude&#xD;
was ever ringing in my ears. Oh! how I longed to be back&#xD;
in my own locust-grove among the birds, where the blend-&#xD;
ing melodies of breeze and river's wave might fall upon my&#xD;
heart, and yonder hill, sweeping round so gracefully, might&#xD;
again fill my eye. Night after iiight, 'in dreams, my fancy&#xD;
accompanied my heart back to the woodlands, and I listen-&#xD;
ed to the songs of the blessed birds, and saw the hill kissing&#xD;
the sky, and the stream reflecting -the stars, and I felt like a&#xD;
child - on my native sod again. Yes, my heart was here,&#xD;
where -I trust in life and death my body will ever be."&#xD;
"And- I," said Drayton, catching George's enthusiasm,&#xD;
"at the same time was in my native village, longing to be&#xD;
ui~ the busy city, where among men I might act my part.&#xD;
There I often dreamed of the splendid career the tongue of&#xD;
eloquence might secure, and -of the many triumphs the im-&#xD;
perial spirit - of genius might make its own. I longed to&#xD;
throw myself on the sea ~f popular commotion, and to strike&#xD;
boldly for its proudest results. I thought it would be the&#xD;
highest happiness to measure weapons with renowned chain-&#xD;
-~Zon8 on the bloodless fields of intellectual warfare. I fan-&#xD;
cied that in such. scenes the ambitious heart would find the&#xD;
boon it craves, and that there, too, wisdom would borrow&#xD;
ne~ energies from experience, while the imagination would&#xD;
str~iigthen its soaring wings. Ambition Was my idol, as&#xD;
nature was-yours."  '  -          -&#xD;
"You bring back to my mind the days when I was young,&#xD;
and, like you, full of hope," said old Mr. Meredith, -who had&#xD;

Drayton, you will learn the same bitter lesson from your ex-&#xD;
perience before your head is as white as mine. This lesson&#xD;
one will not learn from the lips or fate of others, and ex-&#xD;
perience is the only tutor that* ever teaches it effectually.&#xD;
Whenever I listen to the enthusiasm of youth, I can not but&#xD;
fear experience will chill it, and that disappointments will&#xD;
crush every hope it creates."&#xD;
Here the conversation was interrupted by the. approach&#xD;
of two persons, who, as they are to act important parts iii&#xD;
this history, require to be particularly introduced.&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
THE persons who approached were a gentlemen and lady,,&#xD;
and, as Drayton glanced at the beautiful form of the latter,&#xD;
he at first suspected, and was soon convinced, that she was&#xD;
the one of whom he had been dreaming for the last week.&#xD;
From her strong likeness to George, he immediately con-&#xD;
cluded that she was the lady of whom his uncle had spoken&#xD;
in such high terms of praise, and he was not mistaken.&#xD;
As Ellen Meredith drew near, Drayton's first impressions&#xD;
of her beauty were fully sustained. She was walking with&#xD;
a careless step by the side of her companion, and he~ uncon-&#xD;
cerned manner heightened rather than subdued the grace.-&#xD;
fulness- of her motions. She was of the average stature of&#xD;
her sex, and in her form delicate without being fragile. Hez&#xD;
finely-rounded neck, full bust, tapering waist, and small foot&#xD;
compared advantageously with those- of the proudest ai~d&#xD;
most peerless beauty in the land. A light-bonnet, pusWed&#xD;
back from her-face, left her unshadowed features exposed to&#xD;
a full view. Her rich black and clustering curls s, e t her&#xD;
cheeks as the winds of evening wantoned ky. Her - head&#xD;
was low, but beautifully formed, and on its unwrinkled siir&#xD;
face displayed 'the consciousness, as well as the ?O~essior1,&#xD;
of superior intellect. It was on the dark, sparkling eye and&#xD;
the rainbow-like symmetry of the brow that circled over it,&#xD;

that' the eye of an observer loved most to linger, although&#xD;
a fascinating smile usually played ow her lips, aM. gave to&#xD;
her i countenance a peculiarly amiable expression, which,&#xD;
blending with the pride and the mind tadiating from the&#xD;
eye, niade her face one of the most intensely interesting that&#xD;
the delighted gaze of lover evet dwelt on. Many might&#xD;
boast more symmetrical features, but it was the soul melt-&#xD;
zug through and' illuminating hers that made Ellen Mere-&#xD;
dith's facefa~cinating. in the extreme. Once seen, its effect&#xD;
lingered on the memory, and glowed, in the depths of the&#xD;
past like a star of all others most splendid. The crystal&#xD;
stream, quietly pursuing its course in shadow, is beautiful;&#xD;
but it is only when the stars and moonbean~s are dancing in.&#xD;
its bosom, ,that its power' of producing interest in the mind&#xD;
of the observer is fully displayed; and thus, when Ellen's&#xD;
features were in repose, the calm and dreamy sweetness&#xD;
which rested in them was pleasing, but when the vivid&#xD;
thought flashed in her eye, and the soft and melodious tones&#xD;
of her voice ~'ose on the ear, her face exhibited in its radi-&#xD;
ant and changing expressions the sweetness and beauty for&#xD;
which it was remarkable, and became interesting almost&#xD;
beyond comparison.&#xD;
She had passed her twentieth ye~x, and, though greatly&#xD;
admired and' courted, she had not seen fit to trust her hap-&#xD;
piness on the 'sea of matrimony to the "shattered plank" of&#xD;
man's faith. In her manner grace and dignity blended like&#xD;
lightAnd shadow in a picture, each enhancing the. other, or&#xD;
like word and tone in a loved song, uniting to produce the&#xD;
ef*~ct neither has separately. In conversation she was much&#xD;
admired, ~for she threw the most interesting associations&#xD;
about t4~e humblest subjects. With 'a felicitous tact, she&#xD;
adapte~I1ierself to the mood of the person with whom she&#xD;
chanced to be; and' the light and trifling beings who were'&#xD;
fond of fluttering about her, like summer~ insects about a&#xD;
laknp, found ~a charm in het wild laugh and exuberant spir-&#xD;
its, equal to that which the more gifted enjoyed in the splen-&#xD;
dor arid tr~uthfulness of her mind..'&#xD;
As they approached the house, Drayton glanced from the&#xD;
lady to 'her' companion, and recognized in him ou~ ~4~i the&#xD;
three persons he had observed in conversation near his o~lce&#xD;
on the aYtetnoon he first visited it. His name was B4wa~d&#xD;
Hampton, one who was well known throughout the neigh-&#xD;
borhood as a youth of talent, address, and pre~ligacy6 He&#xD;
was vain as Narcissus, and fancied no lady cou14~resist his&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON~.&#xD;
&#xD;
41,&#xD;
&#xD;
fascin~tions. His wardrobe was altogether nnexce~tjonia-&#xD;
ble ;. lie was the "glass of fashio~." to the d&amp;amp;ndies in that seo-&#xD;
tion, and was generally appareled in black, which color he&#xD;
thought most becoming to hi~ dark and swarthy complexion.&#xD;
lie professed worldliness and a high sense of honor, and was&#xD;
utterly unprincipled. He w&amp;amp;s gifted with beauty and tab&#xD;
ent, and was vain of them. He was liii Alcibiades in form&#xD;
and a Nash in coxcombry. He professed liberality, and was&#xD;
mean and selfish. In fine, he was one of tho~e young men'&#xD;
who to be detested need but to be known, and yet who have&#xD;
tact enough to hide their profligacy, and sufficient address,&#xD;
to impose themselves on all but the most sagacious as bet~&#xD;
ter persons than they are.&#xD;
Mrs. Hampton, the mother of Edward, was a wi4ow lady&#xD;
of great eccentricity, who resided near the road opposite to&#xD;
Oakwood, in a neat1 two-story frame house, nearly hidden&#xD;
from the eye of the traveler by shrubbery and trees. She&#xD;
had been quite ill for a week, and'Ellen Me~edith had been&#xD;
spending the day with her, ministering to her thousand&#xD;
war~ts. Edward lived in the city, and happened to arrive&#xD;
just as Miss Meredith was leaving, and accomp~.uied hex&#xD;
home. There was an air of self-satisfaction and an assnin~p~~&#xD;
tion of superiority about him that disgusted ]2)raytou the&#xD;
moment he was introduced to him. lie took his seat very&#xD;
near Miss Meredith, and exhibited all the graces of manner&#xD;
of which he was proud~ and which he thought winning~ and&#xD;
some of his, acquaintances thought enviable.&#xD;
"Mrs. Walker gave a magnificent party last night,~' said:&#xD;
Hampton, addressing Ellen, in a tone which was audible, to~&#xD;
every one; "all the town and all the ton were the'~e; amid -'&#xD;
but for the absence of one or two fro~ the coun whq&#xD;
were expected, every moment would have been win like&#xD;
a houri, and every one wQuld have been happy~.&#xD;
why were you not there, Mis~s Meredith  e"&#xD;
'~' Brother ~,vas not ~well, and I remained ,at' home ti~' at~&#xD;

"Your old beau, Joe Thom~en," said Han~ptonwho did&#xD;
not think George's ilhiess a sufficient reason why Ellen&#xD;
sh~ul~i have absented herself from the party, remarkedd to&#xD;

"What Mr. Thomson spoke jestingly is true," said~flhlen;&#xD;
for I have more love for nature than society, though I am&#xD;
fond of both."&#xD;
Turning 'from Hampton, she glanced at Drayton, and said,&#xD;
"I understand you have come to reside among us, Mr. Dray-&#xD;
ton, and I hope you will meet with nothing that will cause&#xD;
you to regret it."&#xD;
"Thank you. Every thing I have yet seen tends to con-&#xD;
vince me that in changing my place of abode I shall great-&#xD;
ly enhance my pleasures."&#xD;
~'-When you are socially disposed," said Ellen, with a.&#xD;
smile, and a tone of voice that told with great effect on Dray-&#xD;
ton's sensibilities, "you will find many gay and beautiful la.-&#xD;
dies worthy of your admiration, and some very gifted and hon-&#xD;
orible gentlemen in our society."&#xD;
Drayton was considering the propriety of uttering a com-&#xD;
pliment, when Hampton said,&#xD;
"You must not judge from. the specimens before you, sir,&#xD;
or you will be disappointed, for you will form too high an es-&#xD;
timate. Many of the fair ladies.-.-I regret to say it, Miss&#xD;
Meredith, but truth compels me-many of the fair ladies are&#xD;
false, very false, and many of the honorable gentlemen are&#xD;
fools-absolute' foola,"&#xD;
"I~y! Mr. Hampton, how you slander !" exclaimed Ellen.&#xD;
"Believe me, Mr. Drayton, if your heart is not steeled against&#xD;
all the arts and insinuations of beauty, its happii~iess will be&#xD;
in great jeopardy, for there are scores of mischief-working&#xD;
eyes, whose glances have proved fatal in innumerable in-&#xD;
stances."&#xD;
'"If I were ever so skeptical, I should be forced to believe&#xD;
you, Ntiss Meredith," returned Drayton, with a graceful in-&#xD;
clination of the head; "for who could doubt with the evi-&#xD;
dence 'of the truth of what you say so vivid before ihim ?"&#xD;
* "You are doomed, sir, if my weak' and dull eyes can ex-&#xD;
tort so neat a compliment from you. Prepare yourself with&#xD;
a large ~tock"'of sighs and 'compliments, for you will meet&#xD;
hundreds who will make irresistible demands on your admi-&#xD;
ration."&#xD;
"If it shall be my fate to fall, pierced by many' arrows, I&#xD;
hope'I may die with the composure and dignity of the old&#xD;
Roman hero, who gathered his mantle gr~cofully' about his&#xD;
~form as he fell,~' returned Drayton, who was in the habit of&#xD;
basting 'himself as invulnerable' as AchiUes, but who felt,&#xD;
at that moment, as susceptible as i~eander.&#xD;

Supper Was announced~ and, after that meal was dispatch-&#xD;
ed, they gathered in the parlor, where an animated conver-&#xD;
sation was sustained to a late hour. Whenithey separated&#xD;
for the night, Drayton took a seat by the window, and look-&#xD;
ed out on what he considered the most beautiful prospect he&#xD;
had ever seen. The moon was descending the wOst~rn 'heav-&#xD;
en in great splendor, and threw a soft light on the dreamy&#xD;
beauty of the landscape. The hum of insects in the frees,&#xD;
and the sounds of a creek dashing over its rocky bed, mellow-&#xD;
L ed by distance, rose on his 'ear. The course of his reflections&#xD;
was interrupted by a knock at his door, and, on opening it,&#xD;
he saw George Meredith, who asked him to join his sister&#xD;
and himself in an excursion to a hill at a short distance ear-&#xD;
ly on the ensuing morning., Drayton accepted the invita-&#xD;
tion, and resumed his seat, where he remained for an hour&#xD;
absorbed in meditation.&#xD;
"How strange! how strange," thought he, "are many of&#xD;
the occi~irrences of this life! Here am I feeling quite at home&#xD;
in a family of whose existence I was' not aware one short&#xD;
week ago. And then, how strange it is that I should have&#xD;
dreamed so much of Miss Meredith before I knew who she&#xD;
was! By Jove! she's a glorious girl! What beauty, what&#xD;
tact, what sense she possesses! I must not be much in her&#xD;
society, else my studies will be sadly neglected. I must for-&#xD;
tify my heart against her influence, for she is proud, andy I&#xD;
suspect, aristocratic in her feelings;~ and when she hears her&#xD;
humble servant was, once upon a time, an apprentice to a&#xD;
cobbler, she will look upon me. with contempt, or, at least,&#xD;
compassion, which is worse. The fact of my having been a.&#xD;
shoemaker, I foresee, will be a great disadvantage to me, and,&#xD;
however revolting to my pride, I must forestall all goa~ip by&#xD;
taUring of it myself. My blood is as patricianlas the best,&#xD;
and, because it has been.'my fate to toil at &amp;amp;n humble occu-&#xD;
pation, is that any reason why I should feel myself dishonor-'&#xD;
ed? Frank Drayton, there are breakers ahead! You must&#xD;
wear as scornful a lip and as haughty a brow as the proudest&#xD;
you meet. I will not slink off with a shamed face, as' if I&#xD;
were unworthy to associate with the haughtiest, for that&#xD;
would look' as if I was, conscious of practicing exception on&#xD;
them. By the blood of my heart! I willeonquer the preju-&#xD;
dices "in my way, and show those who may be disposed to&#xD;
flingtheir jeers at me that I ,am their superior. Yes, I '~jhl &#xD;
blister the tongue of sla~ider, and~ wreak on the 'ealumnia~or&#xD;
the vengeance which offended. pride denounces against him..&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7761-00000023"/>&#xD;
If~r~y~ good. genius, which has guided me so far, does not de..&#xD;
sert in. in the crisis of my fortunes, IL must~succeed, for the&#xD;
oracular voic&amp;amp; in the depths of my spirit has predicted vie-&#xD;
tQry for me, and by that sign I must conquer. I wonder,"&#xD;
he continuedd, after a silence of a minute; "I wonder what&#xD;
iwpressiou I made on that fair lady this evening? She list-&#xD;
ened to me with flattering attention, and was evidently&#xD;
pleased~ when I was talking about the obstacles that genius&#xD;
has to. encounter in its efforts to win the laurel. Why am I&#xD;
so anxioiis- to please her? Am I an incipient case of love?&#xD;
By all that's proper, I must rebel against the tender pas-&#xD;
sion until I have secured some reputation and the means of&#xD;
supporting a wife."&#xD;
Long after, his head had touched his pillow, such thoughts&#xD;
engrossed his mind. At length he slept, and was in the&#xD;
mjdst of a wild dream, when a rap at the door roused him.&#xD;
On opening. his -eyes he found that day had dawned, and&#xD;
heard the birds pouring forth their songs. He thought of his&#xD;
engagement, jumped up, made his toilet, and went down&#xD;
stairs.&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
DRAYTON proceeded to the porch, where he met George,&#xD;
with whip in hand, ready for the ride. Ellen soon made&#xD;
her appearance, and all things being ready, Drayton assisted&#xD;
the lady to her ~addle with a tremulous nerve.&#xD;
They rode off in fine spirits and at a rapid pace. Ellen&#xD;
was a graceful rider, and as Drayton glanced at her cheek,&#xD;
glowing in the fresh air of the morning, it is no exaggeration&#xD;
to say he thought her the most beautiful being in the world.&#xD;
They had proceeded about half a mile, when Ellen sud--&#xD;
denly reined in her horse and stopped in front of a little cot-&#xD;
*tago situated a short distance from the road.&#xD;
"You are- industrious this morning, Mary. How' is your&#xD;
mother?" inquired Miss Meredith, addressing a very fair girl,&#xD;
who was pulling a~bouquet in front of the cottage.&#xD;
"Pretty well, I thankyou, Miss IMlen ;" and, as she' spoke,&#xD;
she lifted her head from the flowers, a~ud brushed the tresses&#xD;
from before her eyes.&#xD;
She was a gay, gladdicarted being of seventeen, whose&#xD;

£air~brow'looked so clear that you would have fancied that&#xD;
no grief had ever cast its murkiness upon it; for wheii the&#xD;
brow of one of these creatures has worn the &amp;amp;ble hue- of a&#xD;
deep sorrow, an impression remains like the blight 'of frost&#xD;
upon an early spring flower. Mary Winters had experi-&#xD;
enced no troubles, as her ever-joyous and sparkling eyes&#xD;
plainly ijidicated. Her cheek wore its crimson. as aii em-&#xD;
press wears her robe, proudly and naturally; and her laugh-&#xD;
ing mouth and glistening teeth proved the happiness oftlie&#xD;
heart that fluttered, like a frightened bird, -beneath Ahe pow-&#xD;
er of every wild- emotion. Her form was slight arid buoyant,&#xD;
and under the average stature. 'Such was Mary Winters,&#xD;
the darling of her widowed mother, with whom she lived.&#xD;
Their condition was au. humble o~te, yet they were 'happy,&#xD;
and did not seem to envy the lot of any to whom 1~'ortuiie&#xD;
had been, more propiti9us.&#xD;
"Mary, why have you not been to sOe me for generall&#xD;
days ?" said Bllen~ "If you. do not do better, IL will not&#xD;
give you the shrubbery I promised you."&#xD;
"And I will tell Roger tha.t you are not half so 'kind and&#xD;
good as he thinks you," said George.&#xD;
Mary blushed as the name of Roger was mentioned, and&#xD;
turned, her cheek aside, too late to escape notice. George&#xD;
continued,&#xD;
"Mary, have you forgotten how you used to come over to&#xD;
our house when I was sick, and sit by me, and sew, and talk,&#xD;
and fan me, and bring a glass of water when I wanted it ?"&#xD;
"Indeed I h&amp;amp;ve not, sir," replied Mary; "and if you were&#xD;
sick, and I knew of it, I would come there and do every&#xD;
thing in the world for you again. You have not been sick&#xD;
lately, have you ?" and, as she spoke, the sincere anxiety de-&#xD;
picted in her countenance touched George's feelings. He&#xD;
replied,&#xD;
"I have been about as usual; but, Mary, I wish you&#xD;
would come and see for yourself, for you know how much I&#xD;
love to see you."&#xD;
"I would have been to see you," said Mary, picking the&#xD;
leaves from a rose she held in her hand, "only I've been so&#xD;
much engaged. Roger-" and here she hesitated, "told&#xD;
me you were well."&#xD;
"IRoger, I suppose, keeps you pretty well info~uned. How&#xD;
does he come on, Mary? He is a very clever and deserving&#xD;
* fellow, and I fear, from your blushing, that he will cut me&#xD;
out."&#xD;

Mary laughed~ and avoided answering the question by ask.&#xD;
ing Elleu if she woul4 not accept a beautiful moss-rosebud&#xD;
which she extended toward her.&#xD;
They pursued their ride toward the hill, which was about&#xD;
a miJ~e further on, till they reached its base, when they turn-&#xD;
ed off from the road toward the river, and, atter going a ~hort&#xD;
distance% they commenced the ascent. They wound up the&#xD;
side of the hill slowly, and by The time they reached the sum-&#xD;
mit the sum was just lifting his golden rim above the horizon.&#xD;
T~hi~ view that now presented itself was magnificent. The&#xD;
river swept the foot of the hill, while to the right a chain-&#xD;
paign country was spread out far and wide', over which the&#xD;
eye could rove without an object to lim4t the range of vision.&#xD;
The'fresh morning, wind was driving the mist along the bo-&#xD;
som of the river, wreathing it into ten thousand grotesque and&#xD;
iieautiful pictures. At intervals, on the banks of the stream,&#xD;
houses of: all sorts, from the loftiest to the lowliest, were&#xD;
placed,. watching like sentinels over its course. Houses,&#xD;
fields, and woodlands diversified the landscape, while, in the&#xD;
distance; the lofty, spires of the city, flashing in the first beams&#xD;
of~the rising sun, were visible. But the eastern sky was the&#xD;
point.which embodied most of grandeur and interest to the&#xD;
eye. Near the horizon, narrow strata of dense clouds were&#xD;
reposing,. looking like imperial couches with their golden&#xD;
fringes, on which slumbered gigantic forms; whose outlines&#xD;
were traced ~on the uneven edges of thel superincumbent&#xD;
clouds. As the eye ascended toward the zenith, the masses&#xD;
diminished in size and density, while their orange tints con-&#xD;
trasted beautifully with the crimson and purple hues below&#xD;
them. The gorgeous "eye of the universe" was soon cleared&#xD;
of the mists which dimmed it, and looked forth resplendent&#xD;
on hill, and tree, and distant spire. The birds were caroling&#xD;
their loves from every bough, rejoicing that the curtain, of&#xD;
night had been lifted by the monarch of day.&#xD;
"There, now! Mr. Drayton," said Ellen, "I think you must&#xD;
confess that such a prospect as this is ample remuneration&#xD;
for lost morning dreams. Isn't it beautiful ?"&#xD;
"It is indeed beautiful," returned Drayton, in a voice that&#xD;
indicated the 4epth of hi~ admiration for such scenes; "and&#xD;
do you often come hither to enjoy it ?"&#xD;
"Oh "yes! Brother and I scarcely ever suffer a bright&#xD;
morning to pass away without paying our respects to the ris-&#xD;
ing sun"                     ~ldl&#xD;

to keep by the side of Ellen as she swept gracefully aLong.&#xD;
"Sometimes, when we, are lazy in starting, we hurry along&#xD;
like the wind, to get here before the ~unbcams~ You must&#xD;
consider, Mr. Drayton," continued Ellen, smiling, "that I am&#xD;
not one of your extra-delicate city girls, who would rather&#xD;
live without a reputation for horsemanship than win one at&#xD;
the perilous price of a gallop. When I ride, I like to fly like&#xD;
the antelope before the wind."&#xD;
"That's a gorgeous spectacle," exclaimeil George, aftor&#xD;
looking toward the east for a moment, and pointing toward&#xD;
the rising sun enveloped in clouds radiant in his beams.&#xD;
"See," he continued, "See how the Sun flings the clouds&#xD;
aside as he rushes up the sky, like a fair lady brushing aside&#xD;
the vail that obscures the radiance of her features~ Did 'old&#xD;
Neptune ever spurn the~ chafing       g billows with&#xD;
more evident disdain ?"&#xD;
Ellen and Drayton looked and admired; axid~ George,&#xD;
turning toward the gleaming s~ire~ of the city, continued,&#xD;
"In the dust and vitiated air of that place, the many per-&#xD;
sons are slumbering who would persuade me that there1 and&#xD;
not here, is to be found the temple in which genius should&#xD;
worship. The ancients had a better conception of things,&#xD;
and placed Helicon on a moulitain; but our modern sages&#xD;
tell us that the muses are more frequently to be met trail-&#xD;
ing their gorgeous robes through 'the dust of the city, than&#xD;
here, on the~ hill-tops, where the birds and breezes make&#xD;
melody that might tempt an angel down."&#xD;
They resumed their ride, and Ellen proposed they should&#xD;
return by a~ more circuitous route, which was agreed to.&#xD;
They had proceeded but a short distance from the foot of&#xD;
the hill, when Drayton observecLa singular-looking one.story&#xD;
stone house, hid in trees, and said,&#xD;
"By all that's romantic, that is just such a spot as a&#xD;
sighing swain would choose to retire to,; for there he might&#xD;
live sacred from intrusion, ~.nd enjoy all the raptures of his&#xD;
dream of love undisturbed."&#xD;
"Yet, sir, the tenant bf that place is a hater, and not a&#xD;
lover of his species," returned Ellen; "and there he is," she&#xD;
added, in a lower tone of voice.&#xD;
Through an opening in the branches, Drayton discovered&#xD;
a singular person, with a large, brawny frame~ walking up&#xD;
and down in front of the house, with his hands locked in each&#xD;
other behind his back, His eyes were cast gloomily on the&#xD;

gr~iuid, ~a~id at his heels was a dog tha~ would occasionally&#xD;
~run~ rotLt of hjs master, and look up in his race as if ~.nx-&#xD;
ious. to be noticed. He was quite an Qid ulan, and was&#xD;
dressed in garments of a very autiquated fashion, which hung&#xD;
loosely obout him, as if his frame had shrunk since they&#xD;
w~te i~tade. His forehead was high and deeply wrinkled,&#xD;
and a depression between the eyebrows gave to his face an&#xD;
expression of great atwterity. He wore a long grizzly beard,&#xD;
and his long locks, whitened by age, clustered in masses over&#xD;
the collar of his coat, descending to his shoulderss. There&#xD;
was so much misanthropy and scorn blended in the expres-&#xD;
sion of his mouth, that Drayton would have pronounced him&#xD;
a hater of his kind even if Ellen had not told him so.&#xD;
"Good morning, Mr. Fleetwood !" said George, who was&#xD;
a short distance before the others, turning toward the house.&#xD;
"Who are you? What brings you here? You couldn't&#xD;
have uttered your salutation in a more unwelcome ear. The&#xD;
river is to the, right, and the road is on the left. You can&#xD;
have 'your choice. They will both take you away~&#xD;

nearer to the old man.&#xD;
"It is you, iS it, my son. lYLy sight is getting hazy, and&#xD;
I can't distinguish objects.' I thought it was some fool from&#xD;
town. Row is the family? And why is not your sweet&#xD;
sister with you this morning ?",&#xD;
"There she is," returned George. The forms of his sister&#xD;
and Drayton appeared in front of the house.&#xD;
"Let us go up and get a closer view of that strange being,"&#xD;
said Dr&amp;amp;yton, in whose mind the outr6 appearance of the old&#xD;
gen.tleniau excited much interest. "I am for~d of inspecting&#xD;
* prodigies, and he, it strikes me, is one."&#xD;
"He is," replied Ellen; "but you must.not think of going&#xD;
nearer, else he will insult you. He rarely holds communi.~&#xD;
cation with any persons out of our family. My father has&#xD;
befriended him, and he tolerates us on that account. He&#xD;
lives in complete exile here, and looks on those who try to&#xD;
see him with contempt.~ He is looking this way snow; let&#xD;
us ride on."&#xD;
They passed out of sight slowly. Meantime George con-&#xD;
tinued talking with Mr. Fleetwood.&#xD;
"Is that fellow with your sister the ~popinjay I saw with&#xD;
her one morning, a month ago, on the hill?"&#xD;
"No, sir; you ha~ ~never seen him before. He is a&#xD;
stranger in this, part of. the country. His name is l~rayton..-&#xD;
&#xD;
a grandson of a. gentleman of that name, who once live4 at&#xD;
Oakwood."&#xD;
"What! a gr~ndsou of Dick Drayton ?" incjuired the old&#xD;
gentleman, hastily,' as if he was greatly surprised.&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Dick Drayton, your grandfather, and myself were thick&#xD;
as pickpockets when we were young. That yoi~ng man&#xD;
must be a' son of Tom Drayton...-~for Dick had but one, and&#xD;
his name was Tom-who left here when a yoi~th, before the'&#xD;
war."&#xD;
"Yes, sir, he is."&#xD;
"I'd like to see a grandson of Dick Drayton, if he is not&#xD;
one of those impertinent fools who stare as if they were, oi4y&#xD;
suffered to. look out of their eyes one moment befor&#xD;
struck with everlastii~g blindness."         e being&#xD;
"I will call him back," said George. "He will not dis.~'&#xD;
gust. you."&#xD;
The old gentleman said nothing, and George rode oil' and&#xD;
so~n returned with Drayton and his sister., Mr.. FLeetwood&#xD;
shook Ellen's hand, and then turned to look at Drayton. "He&#xD;
stood for a moment gazing earnestly a.t hini while~ not a.&#xD;
word wa~ spoken. After having surveyed him deliberately&#xD;
from head to foot, he said,&#xD;
"Pull off'your hat, if you please, sir."&#xD;
Drayton lifted his hat from his head, and the old gentle.&#xD;
man regarded him intently again, and then said,&#xD;
"Brush the hair from your forehead."&#xD;
])rayton did as desired, smiling as he obeyed whaI~he con-&#xD;
sidered a mere humor of the old gentleman's. Hi~ ~erntiny&#xD;
this time was searching, and Drayton almost recoiled from&#xD;
the 'intensity of his' glances. Mr.. Fleetwood, knit his brow,&#xD;
drooped his head, looked on the ground, and thought. An-&#xD;
other glance, and a gleam of light flashed over his features,&#xD;
relaxed their sternne~s~ and he exclaimed,&#xD;
" The eye argi nose are strangers to me; but the form, the&#xD;
lip, and. the brow are Dick Drayton' s." -   -&#xD;
The'~ld man wheeled suddenly round, and, without speak..&#xD;
ing ~iiother word, left them. He waved his. hand, as he en-&#xD;
tered the door of his house, as 'if he w~slied them to depart,&#xD;
and disappeared.&#xD;
They rode off slowly, talking of the singular interview.&#xD;
Drayton was at a loss to understand the old gentleman's&#xD;
conduct, when George remarl~ed. .Vdiini,&#xD;

again."&#xD;
If you can get Lather to accompai~iy you, he will receive&#xD;

from hints he has occasionally dipped in conversation, for&#xD;
'he regar~ a disposition to pry into the mystery that over-&#xD;

"Mr. Drayton, what objections have you to a race ?" in-&#xD;

"None in the world," replied Drayton.&#xD;
Away they went in fine ~tyle. Ellen was a fearless rider,&#xD;
and excited Drayton's' admiration by the free, swinging mo-&#xD;
tion of her body, graceful as the lithe branches of the willow&#xD;
swaying in the7 br~e~e.' She held the reins of her steed in&#xD;
her small hand firmly, and managed them with rnuch'skill.&#xD;
~Her d~ess fluttered rapidly inthe wind. Objects by 'the road&#xD;

DRAYTON SaW much in 'George Meredith to admire, and:&#xD;
lila 'hearty good opinion was cordially recipro~ated. There&#xD;
was enough difference in their feelings and opinions to en-&#xD;
gender a mutual interest,~ and not '~enough unlikeness to shock.&#xD;
The firmest friendships are formed between persons who 'have&#xD;
some points of congeniality, and who are not enough alii~e&#xD;
to resemble each other. If a ni*~n could find a being' in all&#xD;
respects like himself, he would avoid him aa'b.e '~would' one&#xD;
with whom he' had nothing iii commou. .' Two men of as-&#xD;
piring natures, striving for different sorts of eminence, (heart~'&#xD;
en) each other; whereas, if both sought the #~am~ object,&#xD;
rivalry would soon sunder their spirits. We 'may lik&amp;amp;a qual-&#xD;
ity'in ourselves well 'enough, and hate the manifestations of&#xD;
it in another. A man l~ves the sweetness and sense of de-&#xD;
pendence in woman, and she loves his courage and inde...&#xD;
pendence; and the principle which regulates the~ choice of&#xD;
the sexes' applies to persons of our o~wn gender. The ten-&#xD;
derness of George's feelings and the imaginativeness of his&#xD;
mind'won th~ayton's high regard, while Meredith saw m~~h&#xD;
in the more practical views of his. friend. tQ &amp;amp;dmire&#xD;
After breakfast, Ellen 'left them to 'attend to her domestic&#xD;
duties, and George and Drayton retired to the porch. I'hey&#xD;
were talking of the pleasures of their ride, when a young'&#xD;
inasu, whOse appearance was that of a. laborer,: approached&#xD;
them. There was' a ~inguii~rly quizzical expression about&#xD;

the shadow of the house, and brushed the matted masses of'&#xD;

He .plaiited one.. foot on the 'steps of the porch, and with an&#xD;
eLbow on his knee, and his chin on the palm of his hand, he&#xD;
looked up at George, and said,-&#xD;
"Have you done that job yet?"&#xD;
"What job, Roger?"&#xD;
Why, what you promised .me last week."&#xD;
"I have really forgotten what I dicbpromise."&#xD;
"You see~n to forget your promises," said Roger, looking&#xD;
cunningly at George, "lil~ old ]~ill Smith forgets his, who&#xD;
has been promising his. wife that every spree '11 be his last&#xD;
for the. l&amp;amp;~t ten years, and gets drunk twice every week yet9"&#xD;
"Oh! .1 reniember, I promised you a bit of poetry,. and I&#xD;
suppose&amp;amp; you mean that?".&#xD;
"Exactly, and j['d like to have it to-night."&#xD;
"Either you or your sweet-heart, Roger, must be in a pro-&#xD;
digiously great hurry. How are you getting along with&#xD;
her?".&#xD;
"As rapid' as a sail-boat before the wind.."&#xD;
"You'll be upset like a sail-boat. in a squall, if you don't&#xD;
keep an aye to the windward. You see, Roger, that same&#xD;
pretty little.. ary Winters has an awful streak of coquetry&#xD;
in her compositiou."&#xD;
"rye sailed them seas before, and know how to steer&#xD;
-clear of breakers, Mr. Meredith. But as to them verses, can't&#xD;
you let .a fellow have 'em to-night? I~va-- got a r-ed4Ard in&#xD;
a cornstalk cage that I'm going to give Mary to-night, and&#xD;
I'd like to .take the- verses to. her at the same- time."&#xD;
"Red-bird, e~rnstalk cage, and poetry at once, Roger.!&#xD;

"But a little crossing and care will sharpen' the point of&#xD;
any woman's nose," rejoined George, taking pleasure, as&#xD;
usual, in worrying' Roger, who 'was a -great -favotite with&#xD;
him as well as with :every one else; "and when the blos-&#xD;
som of girlhood. is gone, there's no telling how' sour the fruit&#xD;
may be. It niakes me- smack my lips to think of it. You&#xD;
had better let Mary alone, and. -court Nancy."&#xD;
Rather not, sir. Nancy is a good enough sort of a girl,&#xD;
but then she's no more to be. compared with Mary th~.n skim.&#xD;
milk to cream. Come, now," h~.continued, coaxingly, "let's&#xD;
have the verses to-night." -&#xD;
"What' kind of verses would you. prefer, Roger?"&#xD;
"Any kind 'II do," 'replied Roger; "but I like them' see-&#xD;
saw ones best, that go up and down like Yankee Doodle."&#xD;
Here Roger proceeded to. give a practical illustration of&#xD;
his ta~te in jj~oetry, by whistling Yankee Doodle, and see-&#xD;
sawing the air with. both armS' as the tune rose and fell,&#xD;
while his. head vibrated right and left between his sh~uldcrs&#xD;
like a black fiddler's when he. is scraping music for a dance.&#xD;
Drayton and George laughed heartily at Roger's perform-&#xD;
arice, but he preserved an unsn~iing countenance,' and shook&#xD;
his he~'at the conclusion of it, and said, -&#xD;
"That's the kind of.poetry I like."&#xD;
"Does Mary ever sing for you, Roger?"&#xD;
".Sing! .1 guess she does. She sings sweeter than a&#xD;
thrush. There's not a mocking-bird that wouldn't die of&#xD;
despair- in a week, if he was to try .to imitate her singing."&#xD;
"Well, will you get her to sing the poetry ifI -write, it ?"&#xD;
"I will' do that very thing, sir."&#xD;
"What does the old lady think of your visiting~ierdaugh..&#xD;
ter, Roger ?"&#xD;
"Thinir! why, she thinks I'm 'a little the cleverest felIo~&#xD;
of my size to be found. You see, she smokes, and I always&#xD;
take a paper of-first~ra~te tobacco along for her. It do~i't do,&#xD;
sir, to be 'u~imindful'~f'the old 'folks."&#xD;
"You are a sly dog, -Roger, but Mary will avoid you yet.&#xD;
She is a cunning girl."&#xD;
"She' is as cunning as a fox'; but then, you see, I'm what&#xD;

&#xD;
"Vll~see aboutit," said George; and Roger, happy. in~ the&#xD;
thought of seeing Mary and presenting her with the poetry,&#xD;
went off whistling as he went. He soon returned, and said,&#xD;
in a confidential tone to George,&#xD;
"I tell you. what it is, Mr. Meredith, I don't half like that&#xD;
blue-jay friend of yours, that thinks his own feathers finer&#xD;
than any body else'~s. I mean the one that smells as sweet&#xD;
asa clover field-that blows his nose with a lady's hand-&#xD;
kerchief-that lives over yonder," he continued, pointing to.&#xD;
ward Mrs. Hampton's; "and thatwaiks like a gobbler that's&#xD;
weak in the legs--this way ;" and, suiting the action to the&#xD;
word,. Roger produced a tolerably good imitation of the walk&#xD;
by which Mr. Edward Hampton was known.&#xD;
"Hampton, I suppose you mean ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, that's the devil's name."&#xD;
"What has he been doing that you don't like, Roger?"&#xD;
"If he's not pretty particularly cautious how he walks,&#xD;
he'll get tripped up, that's all."&#xD;
"Has he been interfering with any of your concerns ?"&#xD;
"I'll tell you what he's been doing," said Roger, advanc-&#xD;
ing nearer and lowering the tone of his voice. "He is seen a&#xD;
little too often down here at Mrs. Winters's. He don't mean&#xD;
any qgood by going there, either. H~brings Mary flowers,&#xD;
and the last time he was there he gave her a ring."&#xD;
From his manner, and the unusual seriousness of his face,&#xD;
it was obvious to George that Roger thought there was some&#xD;
danger to be apprehended from flue frequency of Hampton's&#xD;
viSits to Ma Winters. Wishing to remove what he con-&#xD;
sidered a. mei~ fancy from his mind, George laughed, and&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"A rival in the case, eh, Roger? Don't grow~jealous,&#xD;
my dear fellow, because another man, who, like yourself,&#xD;
loves a pr~ty girl, looks occasionally at your Desdemona."&#xD;
But Ro~ was not to be jeered or. laughed out of his fancy,&#xD;
as was evident from the manner in which he said,&#xD;
~ Mary Winters mayn~t be any more to me than she is to&#xD;
you, Mr. Meredith~; but," he continued, knitting his brows&#xD;
and swinging his arm,." but if Hampton should ever injure&#xD;
her, I'll revenge her case with my own iight arm, if I die&#xD;
the next minute for .it-.-~.and I call Heaven to witness that I&#xD;
mean just what I say."&#xD;
"~Wh~w !, my ~dear fellow, keep, cool. He doesn't mean&#xD;
any harm, and if he did, he couldn~'~ accomplish it."&#xD;
"He's a slinking puppy, sir, that's. what he is," said Roger.&#xD;
&#xD;
.1&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
* "He called me a stupid ass one day, because I wasn't fool&#xD;
enough to run and open the gate for him. I told him it was&#xD;
only one man's business, and he might do it hizriself. Now&#xD;
I haven't got as much learning as he has, but I have quite as&#xD;
much, natural sense and feeling, and I'm not going to forget&#xD;
how he abused me."&#xD;
Roger walked off, muttering to himself as he went, and&#xD;
evidently in a much worse humor than) he was when he first&#xD;
joined them; and George and Drayton soon retired to the&#xD;
library.&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
THE library-room was in a wing of the main building,&#xD;
with a large window looking out on the river and the hills&#xD;
beyond it. The books were handsomely arranged, and in-&#xD;
cluded most of the best works in the English language, as&#xD;
well as the most remarkable that had been produced by&#xD;
foreign nations. The Greek and Latin classics, to. which&#xD;
Colonel Meredith was particularly devoted, were of the best&#xD;
editions of those immortal emanations of the mind of an-&#xD;
tiquity, which have survived the mutations of fashions in&#xD;
literature and the strikes of barbarism an4 superstition. The&#xD;
colonel was fond ol~ expatiating on the treasures locked up&#xD;
in these works, and he dwelt~ with peculiar 4lelight on the&#xD;
fact that in ~them are to be found the germs of many of the&#xD;
most important discoveries in government and sciences which&#xD;
have ~ince- been expanded and are now the eemmon prop-&#xD;
erty of mankind. George's literary tastes differed 'from his&#xD;
father's, and those portions of the library which contained&#xD;
the works of the master minds of Great Britain, from Baeoa&#xD;
to Burke, were most frequently cQnsulted by him. T~ ~&#xD;
poets Who have written in our own tongue he was especiaP&#xD;
lydevoted, and had drunk deeply at those living fountains.&#xD;
In their pages he~ found responses to every feeling of his&#xD;
heart, and rich .companionship for every mood that grew&#xD;
upon him ~ and his eye brightened and, his tones became&#xD;
enthusiastic when dwelling on their peculiar excelle'nces.&#xD;
He vindicated~ the superiority of Shakespeare and ~[ilton&#xD;
over Homer and Virgil,.~ and often said he thought Hume&#xD;

'and 'Gibbon infinitely better historians than Jierodotus ~nd&#xD;
Thucydides~&#xD;
The colonel was sitting in the ;library, deeply absorbed in&#xD;
a. volume of Cicero,, when George aud~Drayton entered' the&#xD;
apartment. George requested Drayton to amuse himself&#xD;
with the books while he scribbled the poetry for Roger, He&#xD;
then ~took his seat beside a table and opposite the w*~dow,&#xD;
while Drayton examined a fine picture of the colonel by&#xD;
stuart.&#xD;
I wish I could make an adequate sketch of George Mere-&#xD;
dith as he sat at the table twirling his pen in his fingers, and&#xD;
looking out of the window on the misty summit of a hill in&#xD;
the distance! If I could use the pencil I might do it, but,&#xD;
alas! the pen is incompetent' to the task. A. broad and&#xD;
glaring light streamed through the window and fell upon&#xD;
his face, and, while sitting there, with his auburn locks wav-&#xD;
ing over his pale forehead, and adding to the 'depth and earn-&#xD;
estness of the splendid eye, he looked like a son of inspira-&#xD;
tion, with poetry legible in every feature. His gate was&#xD;
fixed on the hill but for a moment, an&amp;amp; he bent his brow&#xD;
toward the paper before him~ dipped his pen in ink, and be-&#xD;
gan to write.&#xD;
"Do you read Latin, N[r. Drayton ?" asked the colonel, at&#xD;
the same time closing the- volume he was 'reading over his&#xD;
forefinger.&#xD;
'KNo, sir. That noble language is a sealed fountain to&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"~You' lose an incalculable amount of pleasure, then," re-&#xD;
'turned the colonel.' "I had as lief lose my right eye as the&#xD;
privilege of communing with the master spirits of antiquity&#xD;
in their own language.'~&#xD;
"That, privilege," said Drayton, "must be an invaluable&#xD;
one, for I have never seen a person who possessed it who&#xD;
~did not seem to derive a great.deal of pleasure from it. Our&#xD;
best translations, they sq.y; are but poor substitutes for the&#xD;
mighty originals."'&#xD;
"They' say ~a truly," returned the colonel, elevating his&#xD;
spectacles to hi~$~rehead. "A translation is about as much&#xD;
like 'a gi~eat~~i~inal as my -shadow in 'the sun is like me.&#xD;
There may be ii. likeness in the outlines, but'the features, and&#xD;
the spirit that inlbrms them, are but a mass of shade.' ' A&#xD;
tran~slafion is 'a translate'ss opinion of an original inind..~.-a&#xD;
dim and confused i~eflection at best. Pope's Homer, for in-&#xD;
stance, is about' as much like my Homer i~p there," he con-&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.                      57&#xD;
tinued, pointing to a volume 'ef'the glorious old bard, '~as&#xD;
the portrait ~of' William the Conqueror in Hume's history is&#xD;
like that stern old veteran. The one is an engraver's notion&#xD;
of a, warrior's 'face, and the other is a poet's notion of the&#xD;
greake~st man whose poems ever breathed ardor and ~ublim-&#xD;
ity twon the heart of the world. Cooper. has lately pro'&#xD;
duc~&amp;amp;~a translation~ of the old bard-I have a eopy of it..~..-it&#xD;
is truer to the original than Pope's; but there is all the dif-&#xD;
fererice betweexi fliomer and Cowper that there is between&#xD;
yonder butterfly floating on the breeze. and the ~caterpillar&#xD;
crawling on the tree. Yoii might as well attempt to convey&#xD;
an idea of the beau~r and' majesty of the sun to a blind' man,&#xD;
by describing them to him,~ as to impress the mind with a&#xD;
true idea of Homer by means of' a translationn"&#xD;
George continued writing, unmindful of the conversation&#xD;
which was going on behind him, until, having accomplished&#xD;
his tasks he threw his pen down on the table, and leaned&#xD;
back in his 'chair.&#xD;
"What have you been writing, my son ?" asked the colonel,&#xD;
as Georg4 picked up the paper to read what he had written.&#xD;
He smiled as he answered,&#xD;
"A small specimen of foolish rhyme, that's all;" d~nd then,&#xD;
musing a moment, he continued, "' a few pathetic stanzas,&#xD;
supposed to be addressed by Mr. Roger Brown to his sweet-&#xD;
heart, the gentle Mary Winters; ~which, I 'hope, may impress&#xD;
her mind with a favorable estimate of his poetical, ability."&#xD;
"And who first made that happy suggestion, Roger or&#xD;
you ?" inquired the colonel, who' seemed. to be highly amused&#xD;
at the thought that Mr. Brown shoidd address his ~weetheart&#xD;
in rhyme.&#xD;
"I believe the suggestion originated with the lady her~&#xD;
self~" replied George. "She, very rightly supposing her&#xD;
charms worthy of all the celebrity that verse can give them,&#xD;
and not having any other means of acquiring suck a~ tribute,&#xD;
made Roger promise to do it himself. The~ poor fellow&#xD;
bothered his bit of brain without success, until, utterly de-&#xD;
spairing, he applied 'to me to relieve him fto~n the dreadful&#xD;
extremity into which his rash promise ha ~l~4ged him. I&#xD;
agreed to help him out of his diljlcixlty; '~id the job, as&#xD;
Roger properly calls it, isbefore me. I tell you, that many&#xD;
of the Cliloes and Phillises of the old, poets were not the&#xD;
equal of Mary Winters,~ and she only 'requires to be~ made ac~&#xD;
quainted with some Burns iu order to become immortal in&#xD;

hadFo4une been ntore propitious, she ~night at this tirnebo&#xD;
a bAlinnt center in the social world, with all sorts of satel-&#xD;
liVes revolving abopt her."&#xD;
Th She is .certainly a very pretty girl, and her eye is~one of&#xD;
tb~ ~znost roguish I ever saw,"~ said Drayton, on whoxi~ her&#xD;
'a~xty had made a vivid impression; "and it is not strange&#xD;
t1u~t ~even you should 4eem her worthy of a poetical trilute."&#xD;
~X~gree to all the encomiums on Mary," said the colonel;&#xD;
"bt~ come, George, siqpose you read the poetry. I have&#xD;
no i~ubt 4hat you have beaten any song lWatt Prior- ever&#xD;
sang to his mistress, who, unfortunately fox the lovers of-ro-&#xD;
mauve, turned out to be a certain nynqh who was in the&#xD;
habit of fetching mugs of' ale to the thirsting poet and any&#xD;
others who visited the house in which she was employed.&#xD;
The poem, my son-let us have the poem.~~&#xD;
"Well, I will read it; but you will please 'to perceive&#xD;
that they are not exactly such stanzas as I should have Writ-&#xD;
ten had I' been hymning a sweetheart of my own instead&#xD;
of Roger's,?' said George. -He then read as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
TO MARY.&#xD;
have not, Mary, seen, been,&#xD;
A fairer fi)rm than yours, my own sweet girl;&#xD;
Like violet gemmed with dew,&#xD;
Your eye is bright and blue,&#xD;
And o'er it is a brow as fair as pearl.&#xD;
Oh, when I see you smile,&#xD;
So sweet and tree from guile,&#xD;
I think of angels' lips, in heaven above;&#xD;
And round your fairy form~&#xD;
Unnumbered graces swarm,&#xD;
Like bees about a flower, that best they love.&#xD;
flight oft, at end of day,&#xD;
To you I take my way,&#xD;
Like some lonely wild-bird seekiiig his nest;&#xD;
And then, while you are nigh,&#xD;
The moments swiftly fly,&#xD;
Like clouds- beneath themoon, by rude winds pressed.&#xD;
Althongb, whene'er we walk,&#xD;
1 can not to you talk&#xD;
Of flowers awl of stars, as some men do-&#xD;
It isbecause my tongue,&#xD;
Like a gu~ whose fires hung,&#xD;
Oan't do its duty to a heart that's true.&#xD;
'Oh; true as auy~dove&#xD;
P11 be t~you, my love,&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.&#xD;
Md constant as a star, that shines on high:&#xD;
And if the angry storm&#xD;
Should rave around your form,&#xD;
I'll take you to my arms and storms defy.&#xD;
"That's very pretty poetry,' I suppose," said the colonel ~j&#xD;
"hut tEe~idea of the rough and unlocked Roger hy&#xD;
Mary Winters in such strains-.talkirig of stars and flowers,&#xD;
aud bees and bowers; and all the other brilliant thin~s(tht~,t&#xD;
a lover usually adorns his story with, certainlyy involvesrich&#xD;
of the ludicrous. The poetry wou1~ ber well enou~h~fit7&#xD;
~were addressed to Mary by any other heart i.mder the s~veu&#xD;
~ieayens than 'Roger's; hut~ the ides of its coming from that&#xD;
queer specimen of humanity is most rich and rate. My san,&#xD;
you have unfitted me to enjoy Cicero's oration against Verres&#xD;
for the next hour. Roger Brown-birds, bees, and blossoms&#xD;
-that's too good!" And the, colonel rose ffom his seat and&#xD;
walked to the window, laughing as he went.&#xD;
"Are you fond of poetry, Mr. Drayton ?" asked George,&#xD;
when the laughter was over.&#xD;
"Yes. But I have u6t had time to read it very exten-&#xD;
sively, and my reading has generally been much less fanci-&#xD;
ful. I love to read one of Shakspeare's play~ bet e~ t~vo&#xD;
dry law-books: it is like fine music between two ~acts 'ei'a&#xD;
drama."&#xD;
"Some persons seem to think poetry very light reading,"&#xD;
said George, "but I think the man who reads Hamlet,. or&#xD;
Lear, or Paradise Lost, understandingly, finds all his energies&#xD;
as . much taxed as if he were poring over Locke's chapter&#xD;
on Sensation, or Warburton's Disquisition on the Mysterious&#xD;
Import of the sixth Book of the .~neid."&#xD;
George and Drayton had made an engagement to visit the&#xD;
family burying-ground, and~ they left the library io fulfill it.&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
Tm~ family burying ground was on a gentle emixie3t~*,&#xD;
near the bank/of the river, 'axid within sound of its waters.&#xD;
It was enclosed by a brick wall, on all sines of~which the.&#xD;
willow and the locust-tree grew,~ while majestic oaks, elms,&#xD;
and poplars threw their branches heavenward~ at a short&#xD;

distance, some of them sufficiently net~x to cast their, shad-&#xD;
ows on the mansions of the slumbering dead. In one eo&amp;amp;er&#xD;
of the inclosure were two tombs, standing apart from all&#xD;
others, in the shade of a beautiful willow, which drooped its&#xD;
lithe brane1iesabov~e them. Drayton approached them, and,&#xD;
'for th~ first time in his life, he stood beside the grave of his&#xD;
grandfather. By his side, a marble slab informed him, re-&#xD;
posed ~lI that Was mortal of Martha Drayton, his.granchnoth-&#xD;
er~ These tombs were formed of bricks, over which were&#xD;
placed slabs of marble, on which were inscriptions eulogistic&#xD;
of the dead who soldered beneath them. Drayton stood for&#xD;
several minutes absorbed in his own contemp1atio~is, by the&#xD;
~ide of the~graves of his ancestors. All that he had heard of&#xD;
the sweetness and amiableness of the one, and the reckless.~&#xD;
ness of the other, came up forcibly to his mind; and then&#xD;
his thoughts turnedd toward his father, and lie sighed as the&#xD;
probability struck him that his parent would find a grave&#xD;
far from those before him. Thoughts of this kind chased&#xD;
each other through hi~ mind, until he felt himself quite sub-&#xD;
dued by them; ~.nd he turned away to avoid the natural ex-&#xD;
pression of the emotions that were swelling in his bosom.&#xD;
lie approached George, who was standing by the side of&#xD;
his mother's grave. A shade of melancholy reposed on his&#xD;
features, and his gaze was fixed on the ground. He was&#xD;
evidently in deep thought, for he did not notice that Drayton&#xD;
was beside him for some time, and when he did, he started.&#xD;
"There sleeps my another, the best ofwives and tile Iove~.&#xD;
heat of women," said George, pointing, to the grave before&#xD;
him; "and there," he continued, directing his finger to the&#xD;
as yet unbroken sod beside her grave, "and there soon will&#xD;
sleep her only son."&#xD;
Draytoii. was astonished at the calmness of his friend, ~&#xD;
and regarded him with amazement as he waved his slender&#xD;
finger over the spot where he expected to repose when "life's&#xD;
fitful fever" should be passed. He placed his hand on&#xD;
George's shoulders, and said, in a voice scarcely raised above&#xD;
a whispers "iV[y dear friend, how wildly you talk !"&#xD;
Geo~ge looked full in Drayton's face for a moment, and&#xD;
while ~ melancholy smile passed over his features, said,&#xD;
"And do-you fancy' that I talk wildly ?" lie paused an&#xD;
instant, arid then continued, in a tone as low and mournful&#xD;
as.~ ~tn autumnal wind, "I .need ~no prophetic voice to con-&#xD;
vippe me that before yonder sun, has called the flower~ 'of a&#xD;
fe~~ very few more springs into -existence, I shall slumber&#xD;
&#xD;
by the side of tlP~ wanteded being Who watched anxiously over&#xD;
the perilous hours of my infancy. Mr6 ]7)raytom look at me! -&#xD;
Are not this wasted form, and hollow eye, and pallid brow&#xD;
prophetic of an earl~r doom '~ With such evidences of the&#xD;
fate that awaits me, need I that an angel should come down&#xD;
to assure mc of the truth of my forebodings ? I shall repose&#xD;
beneath that sod; and it. may be," he continued, lowering&#xD;
the tone of his voice, "that if you stand where you now do&#xD;
one short year hence, my grave will be before you, and you&#xD;
Will then recall these words, and the form of him wh~ spoke&#xD;
them."&#xD;
A deep sigh heaved Drayton's breast as he gazed at the&#xD;
earnest and tender expression of his friends face, and he&#xD;
started 'a~ he felt the probable truth of his predictioii. His&#xD;
color was exceedingly pale; and his spirit already seemed&#xD;
starting from his eyes. Despite Drayton's strong effort to the&#xD;
contrary, the mis1~ dimmed his vision, arid he averted his&#xD;
head to conceal the 'tea;r that was swelling' up to his eye.&#xD;
The' thought that one so young, so gifted,' so loved, should&#xD;
so soon pass away fixnn. the earth and be seen no more, was~.&#xD;
more than a match for his resolution~, and a crystal drop&#xD;
~peedily gathered and glistened in his eye, quiveM a mo-&#xD;
meiit in the beam, and fell. George observed his emotion,&#xD;
and led him forth from tlw inclosure. They passed silently&#xD;
and slowly to the bank of the river, and seated themselves&#xD;
on a board that was fixed between two oaks.&#xD;
The sun shone inunclouded s~lendor~ The surface of the&#xD;
river was slightly agitated by. the bland 'breeze that went&#xD;
whispering by. Immediately opposite to them, an island of&#xD;
great beauty raised its luxuriant foliage above the bosomof&#xD;
the waters, its shrubbery running down 'to the wttter's.edge,&#xD;
and winning the tribute of a. kiss' from every wave. 'A sloop&#xD;
was ndin~ at anchor' a short distance below the foot of the&#xD;
island, while here and there, in the distance, sail-boats were&#xD;
skimming over the bosom of the river, their white sails al-&#xD;
most touching the' water,' and dipping like the wing~ of a&#xD;
swallow. The' scene Was novel 'to Dra~tton, and he dwelt&#xD;
on it with great pleasure.&#xD;
"'And do you wonder that I should express myself as I&#xD;
have 'done, Mr. Drayton? Why, my dear fellow, I 'have al-&#xD;
ready outlived, though yet young, what I considered my&#xD;
lease oii life. Never did infant close its' eyes more-willingly&#xD;
on its:' mother's bosom than I- should close miiw, if it were&#xD;
not for the knowledge that I shall leave my kind father and&#xD;

most affectionate sister disconsolate. For their sakes would&#xD;
I wish to live and bear the pangs of a dilapidated constitu-&#xD;
tisn. I know they would sincerely feel my loss, while a few&#xD;
others might sigh over my early fat~ and speedily forget me."&#xD;
"l~Lty dear George, you amaze me," returned Drayton.&#xD;
"Is there nothing in this green and beautiful earth, with its&#xD;
flowers, its' streams, and its hills.-..yonder bright sky, with its&#xD;
suns and 4sterhoods of planets-iw the excitements of so-&#xD;
cie1~y~-~-in the tributes that genius wins from the lip of man&#xD;
and the heart of wornau-~in the love of the few and the ad-&#xD;
miration of the many-is there nothing in all these things&#xD;
that one so young and richly endowed as you are should re-&#xD;
gret to 'leave?"&#xD;
"If death were annihilation, I would regret to die," re-&#xD;
turned George; "but in dying~ I shall only pass from a clime&#xD;
of shadows to one of celestial light. Like some gay ship&#xD;
that passes the equinoctial line with all her streamers flying&#xD;
in the' air, my spirit will float over the dark boundary that&#xD;
divides our home from our destined home in heaven~ and&#xD;
bear along with it all the glad remembrances which, belonged&#xD;
to it while lingering here. This may sound presumptuous&#xD;
in your car; but ray spirit does worship the adorable Being&#xD;
who endowed it ,with all its marvelous powers, through the&#xD;
bright and beautiful symbols displayed in creation, and our&#xD;
Father does not suffer such' to perish. The ocean reminds&#xD;
ma of his power, the stars of his sublimity, and the flowers&#xD;
of his love, and in every feeling of devotion I entertain for&#xD;
them,. I express my gratitude to Him who made them~ I&#xD;
love a wide temple-an unrestricted faith, whose articles aie&#xD;
suns, and seas, and' everlasting mountains-for my spirit be.&#xD;
comes as restless as an imprisoned eagle when I attempt to&#xD;
throw a. cireumvalration around it beyond which it is heresy&#xD;
to wander.' Yes," he added, after a momentary pause,. '.' yes,&#xD;
I feel ~that early death is my doom, and I shall embrace my&#xD;
spirit's bride without a murmur."&#xD;
Drayton felt uneasy as he gazed on the flushed cheek and&#xD;
burning eye of his friend, and listened to his voice) which now&#xD;
sounded sepulchral to his fancy. After a pause~ he said,&#xD;
"I confess I should shudder at the prospect' of early death.&#xD;
I wish to live,~ and to win an honorable name. I long to be&#xD;
an' actor~ among men-to do something whose influence may&#xD;
survive me~~~.soto live that, though my na/me may pass awa~y,&#xD;
some 'evidence that I have existed may remain. J wish~ to&#xD;
realize some of my early dreams-~to satisfy myself that the&#xD;

&#xD;
faith I formed years ago in relation to myself was not a mere&#xD;
vagary-to %ight~nobly in the councils of my country, and to&#xD;
die in old age with honors thick as these locks clustering&#xD;
upon ray brow. It, seemusto 'me hard, indeed, that one should&#xD;
be called away, while his energies are yet unexpanded, from&#xD;
this l~eautiful world, where there are so many things tempt.&#xD;
mug him to stay."&#xD;
"If my health were robust," said George; "if every slight&#xD;
exposure did not prostrate me on the bed of sickness; if my&#xD;
too sensitive frame did, not shiver like a leaf in every gale,&#xD;
perhaps I too 'might wish to linger here. But I bave:felt so&#xD;
many pangs-so many of my heart's pulsations have sent the&#xD;
blood through agonized veins-I have counted over so many&#xD;
days of. darkness and nights of suffering, that I feel that this&#xD;
world is not the place for me, and shall bow my head to&#xD;
earth with an unregretting spirit whenever it shall please&#xD;
Providence to call me hence. I have much to live for.&#xD;
Love and ambition both tempt me to stay. I would wish to&#xD;
undertake some intellectual tasks, and prove to my partial&#xD;
friends~ that their estimates, of my ability were not wholly un-&#xD;
warranted-to send~ my thoughts darting upward like the&#xD;
lark, to commune with the stars-to spread the wings of my&#xD;
imagination, and soar like an eagle's flight beyond what is&#xD;
visible, 'and to bring down from the loftiest eminences in the&#xD;
world of mind some evidences of the strength of the pinions&#xD;
that bore me thither. But this may not be. I must die&#xD;
young. The seeds of dissolution are already swelling in my&#xD;
heart, and I shall fall by the way side in early youth and be&#xD;
forgotten-fall while the wish to win a name is warm upon&#xD;
my lips, and the dew of life's morning is fresh and liquid on&#xD;
my 'brow.~~&#xD;
When they returned to the house, the sound of music fell&#xD;
upon their ears, and, on entering one of the parlors, they saw&#xD;
Ellen sitting beside a harp, and the colonel at a short distance&#xD;
from her, watching with great interest her delicate fingers&#xD;
as they danced over the chords. Shepaused when she saw&#xD;
George and Drayton, but soon resumed at their request.&#xD;
As Ellen sat at the .harpwith a flushed cheek and up.&#xD;
raised eye, pouring forth exquisite melody from her lips,&#xD;
Drayton fancied her more than ever beautiful. There was&#xD;
nothing hard or artificial in her singing. 'The tones of her&#xD;
voice were exquisitely sweet, and, as they rose and rang over&#xD;
the apartment, the effect was magical. The expression tf&#xD;
her face varied with the sentiments she sang, arid~ proved&#xD;

with howinuch feeling her tones were blended: for heart&#xD;
was on her lip, and she sang with all the naturalness 'of a&#xD;
bird caroling t~ its mate. Her singing was not of that ar-&#xD;
tiilcial ~'kind...~-~the mere mockery of mtisic-with which the&#xD;
ear is pained and the soul sickened every day; it seemed to&#xD;
be the utterance~ of the deep feelings with which her bosom&#xD;
heaved and swelled. Music, like eloquence, is~ genuine only&#xD;
When it addresses itself to the heart, awakening responses to&#xD;
every thought and feelingit expresses. If this be true, then&#xD;
Ellen Meredith's musii~ was exquisite, for it roused the sen-&#xD;
timents it addressed, and the heart echoed back every word&#xD;
she sang.&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
A LITTLE while after sundown, Mr. Roger Brown, shaved,&#xD;
washed, and well dressed, started off to visit Mary Winters.&#xD;
He Was altogether a 'much better-looking man than he seem-&#xD;
edtobeinthemorning, as he walked off in his highly poF.&#xD;
ished. boots, and new blue coat, and flashing buttons. A tri..&#xD;
umphant smile, which would have daunted any rival, played&#xD;
upon his lisp as .he glanced at the cage and the frightened&#xD;
red1bird he carried in his hand, and thought of the delight&#xD;
with which Mary would accept his gift. He did not go&#xD;
round by 'the road, but took a much nearer route across the&#xD;
fields,'~ and stopped, when he thought no one could see him,&#xD;
and drew fo4h from his pocket the poetry that George had&#xD;
writteit f~r hini. When he had finished reading the precious&#xD;
document, he drew a deep breath, gave a long, low whistle,&#xD;
and said,&#xD;
" Egad! but that's first rate, and as true at preaching.&#xD;
That George Meredith is a clever fellow, and a doused :flne&#xD;
scholar, too."&#xD;
Hw~riug uttered this just' compliment, he glanced over the&#xD;
manuscript again, and read,&#xD;
"Like ~4olet gemmed with dew,&#xD;
YoJIr eye is bright and blue"-&#xD;
that's ag true as gospel, for your eye is as blue as my coat,&#xD;
arid' as bright as the brightest button on it."&#xD;
&#xD;

[&#xD;

DRAY TO N.&#xD;
&#xD;
Continuing, his p0iii~Di, he' came to the last line, and&#xD;
jumped up and exclaimed,&#xD;
"Take you to 'my arms, Mary! that's what P11 do, and&#xD;
hug you too, as close as a, grape-vine hugs an oak sapling."&#xD;
He seemed delighted with the poetry~ and, picking up his&#xD;
cage, he' plunged h~s diseingaged hand into the depths of his&#xD;
pantaloons pocket, and went on his way, whistling a tune&#xD;
that indicated how lightly his "bosom's lord" sat upbn his&#xD;
throne.&#xD;
He soon reached a ditch over which there. wa~ neither&#xD;
bridge nor log, and as 'it was to be crossed, the only alterna-&#xD;
tive was'to jgmp over it, uot#ithstanding its frightful width.&#xD;
Thit Roger was good at a leap,' and, after having selected the&#xD;
most eligible spot, he stepped back in order to give his body&#xD;
a sufficient forward impetus, by running, to cross the ditch&#xD;
safely. Off'he started, with the corn-stalk cage dangling at&#xD;
his side. He reached the ditch, and, placing his dexter foot&#xD;
on the edge of the bank,, sprang. Unfortunately, he did not&#xD;
spring quite far enough, 'for, although he escaped the mud&#xD;
and water, yet the cage he held in his hand, suspended by a&#xD;
string, came, into violent contact With the' top of the b~tnk,&#xD;
and was slw~ttered to pieces'. Away flew the bird, and Roger&#xD;
stood motionless watching its flight. He strained his longing&#xD;
eyes after' it until it seemed a. mere ~peok against the dis-&#xD;
tant sky.&#xD;
Now Roger, although totally linversed in the nomenclature&#xD;
of'the schools, had much of that better sort of philosophy&#xD;
which assuages every grief by thinking lightly of it. instead&#xD;
of cux~sing his fate, he only exclaimed, as the form of the red-&#xD;
bird receded from him,&#xD;
"'Fly-fly for your life, you red rascal, and keep a sharp&#xD;
look-out for snares next time. Never mind," he continued,&#xD;
lowering his tone, "there's plenty more- as red as you are in&#xD;
the .woods, and I'll have another one before the week's out&#xD;
for Mary. When the milk's spilled, there's no use trying&#xD;
over it."&#xD;
He resunied his 'course, and soon had the satisfaction of'&#xD;
seeing Mary Winters's pi~etty form, habited in white, with a&#xD;
blue ribbon about 'the waist, standing in the' door of her&#xD;
~bode. He straightened 'himself to his full height, to give&#xD;
as much' altitude as possible to his thick-set person, and with&#xD;
a broad smile dimpling' his cheeks, he lifted his hat fr6m his&#xD;
head, and wished ~the "'g~i4dess of his idolatry" a most pa't~'&#xD;
ticularly good evening.&#xD;

&#xD;
After a few words had passed~ Roger said,&#xD;
"Mary, I've had the Worst luck in the world. You 'seer&#xD;
I had a bird for you, with feathers as red as your cheek"-&#xD;
here. Roger o~ain touched his hat, and~bowed' gently-" and,&#xD;
as was jumping over that confounded ditch, I struck the&#xD;
cage I had him in againstt a hillock, and broke it,. and~ away&#xD;
flew Mr. Red-bfrd, singing, 'You don't-give ~me to pretty Miss&#xD;
Winters,' in the most impudent manner imaginable."&#xD;
"La, me, Roger, the bird said no such thing; how can&#xD;
you stand there and fib so&#xD;
"Well, then, miss, what in the mischief did he say ?"&#xD;
*' Indeed I' can't tell," replied Mary. "Poor thing," she&#xD;
contimwd, "it was wrong to cage him up, and I'm not sorry&#xD;
he did get away. Have you got that poetry for me yet~ M~.&#xD;
Roger Brown ?"&#xD;
"No, Mary. I tried hard all day, but, like a' tub of per.&#xD;
verse soap, it wouldn't come. I expect I was too sober to&#xD;
write it, as I hear that the fellows that write poetry. have to&#xD;
ge~ tipsy before they can do it. I'll get d.r3lnk a purpose to.&#xD;
morrow, and then I'll write the prettiest little song, perhaps,&#xD;
that your bright' eyes ever did see."&#xD;
"'Don't you know I told you that you shouldn't darken the&#xD;
door of this ,house again until you came to bring, the poetry&#xD;
to me..-so, Sir Roger, you can walk," paid Mary~ 'waving her&#xD;
hand toward the gate, while a smile, whose meaning was&#xD;
very different from 'her~ words; flashed op her features.&#xD;
Roger looked imploringly at her, and, saying "Good-by,"&#xD;
walked off. When he reached the gate, Mary ran after him&#xD;
and said,&#xD;
"Why, Roger, what a gander you are! You were not&#xD;
going, sure enough ?"&#xD;
"To be sure I was," replied Roger; "for don't I always&#xD;
obey the ladies?. Mary," he continued, approaching her, and&#xD;
pulling the poetry from his pocket, "I was only joking.. I&#xD;
have got it; and, though I wrote it myself, it's the best bit&#xD;
of verse you ever saw."&#xD;
He tantalized her for a while by offering her the poetry,&#xD;
and jerking it away when~ she 'attempted ~tQ take it; and&#xD;
when' he had grown tired of tha.t very original sort of fun, he&#xD;
placed one hand on his heart, aud,-bowiug very gallantly,&#xD;
extended the~poetry toward her. N~aiy took it and read it,&#xD;
and while a blush crimsoned her' cheek, she said,&#xD;
"Y~ix never wrote this, .1 know4."&#xD;
"I 'should like to know' who did, then," saidRoger.&#xD;

"Why, Mr. Meredith did," replied Mary. "I knew yo~&#xD;
couldn't write poetry, Roger; but ~ 'wanted a piece, and I&#xD;
knew you could tease Mr. Meredith u.util~ he would write it&#xD;
to get clear of you."&#xD;
Mary stooped down and culled a beautiful red rose, which&#xD;
she presented to Roger, who took it, applied it to his nose,&#xD;
and said,&#xD;
"Mary, this rose is as red as your cheek, and as sweet as~&#xD;
your breath,"&#xD;
As he was putting, the stem of the flower through one of -&#xD;
the butt~n-holes in his waistcoat, Mary said,&#xD;
* "How awkward you ~are. Put the rose inside of your vest,&#xD;
and don't tear the leaves off by pulling the stem through&#xD;
your button-holes. Here, give it to me, and let me fix it for&#xD;
~OLL&#xD;
Taking the ros&amp;amp; from his hand, she placed it in his bo-&#xD;
som, and smilingly said, "Now you look like a gentleman&#xD;
of taste."&#xD;
Roger looked at the flower an instant, and then, in a low&#xD;
and sincere tone, said,&#xD;
"Mary, I'll wear that rose for your sake; and when it&#xD;
begins~ to fade, I'll press it between the leaves of my Bible,&#xD;
and keep.it there as long as I live, to remember the- sweet&#xD;
little hand by that pulled it for me." Here he glanced at&#xD;
the flower again, and added, "I wonder how it comes to pass&#xD;
that ladies have so much more taste than men ? You see,&#xD;
I'd never thought of putting this flower here~"&#xD;
"If ladies hadn't taste, there would be but mighty little&#xD;
of it about here, if all the men were like you," returned Mary,&#xD;
with a smile.&#xD;
"Your tongue is as keen as a razor, and it cuts me to the&#xD;
heart !" said Mr. Brown, placing his hand on his waistcoat.-~&#xD;
In another minute Roger began to dance, and Mary asked&#xD;
him what was the matter.&#xD;
"Nothing in particular," 'he replied; "only, whenever I&#xD;
see your smiling mouth, I feel as happy as a town colt in a&#xD;
clover field, and can't help -ahowing it."&#xD;
"Pshaw, man, yQu're crazy !" said Mary. "Roger," she&#xD;
added, addressing that worthy5 fellow in one of her gentlest&#xD;
tones, '" I have noi~ been walking-to-day, and I want to take&#xD;
some exercise now. If you'll behave yourself, you may go&#xD;
along."&#xD;
"I'll do that ver~r thing," returned Roger, cooking his hat&#xD;
on one side' of his head, and walking on with 'a genteel swag.&#xD;

Methodist rneeiing, and you'll hardly know~ me."&#xD;
They ~walked on, and, by the ~time they reached the bank&#xD;
of the' river, the shades of evening had deepened on the feat-&#xD;
ures of the landscape, but the soft light of the moon rescued&#xD;
the earth from the dofttinion 'of darkness.&#xD;
"Who is that gentleman that was riding with Mis~ Ellen&#xD;
this morning ?" asked Mary.&#xD;
His name is Mr. Drayton," replied Roger.&#xD;
"I thought, from the-way -he looked at her this zn9rz~ing,&#xD;
that he was in love with her. Is he a beau of hers ?"&#xD;
".1 don't know," replied Roger. "How does a man'~ look&#xD;
when he is in love, 1~tfary ?"&#xD;
." If you'll take the trouble, the next time you walk with&#xD;
Nancy Smith, to go down and look at your image in the wa-&#xD;
ter, you'll find out."&#xD;
"I reckon, I had better go and look now,'.' said Roger,&#xD;
starting up.&#xD;
"You'd better not," returned Mary, playfully, "for fear&#xD;
you'd scare the little fishes into fits."&#xD;
"Don't you. thinkthat Mr. Drayton is a handsome manY'&#xD;
~sked Roger.&#xD;
"Yes, he's very'handsome, and I wouldn't be surprised if&#xD;
he and. Miss Ellen wereto make a match. What a. pretty&#xD;
"%~ouple they would be! She is the handsomest and best lady&#xD;
in the world."&#xD;
"Present company excepted,'4 added Rogei~, very gal-&#xD;
lantly.&#xD;
They seated themselves on a log on the bank of' the river,&#xD;
and, after gazing on the bright form of the moon with a&#xD;
dreamy eyes Mary' said,&#xD;
"how does looking up at the sky, when the moon is shin-&#xD;
ing, affect you, Roger?"&#xD;
"It makes me think of your eyes, for they are blue like&#xD;
the. sky,. and bright like the moon."&#xD;
"You're ~a case !" returned Mary; "there's no getting a&#xD;
proper answer to, any thing from you. I never 'look up at&#xD;
sky ou'such. a night as this," she continued, ~azix~g, at&#xD;
the noon, "but I think of-my poor father. A 'hundred times&#xD;
I've thought I could see-his spirit in the little 'clouds sailing,&#xD;
under the moon; and just now I ~aw his foxm as plain as I&#xD;
ever saw it when he was alive, in' that ~oud that passed&#xD;
over the moou~ 'I've often- wondered&amp;amp; ,-*asrl't looking&#xD;

that he was. I wonder, Roger, what becomes of people's&#xD;
spirits ~vhen they die?"&#xD;
"If the preachers tell the truth, most of 'em go to the&#xD;
devil," replied Roger, who, having but little .sentiment in&#xD;
his composition, c~~ld not sympathize with Mary's' finer feel-&#xD;
ings or fancies. She felt wounded by his very unsympa-&#xD;
thetic remark, and starting up, said,&#xD;
"You've got 'no' more feeling than a horse. Come, I am&#xD;
going home, and lend rue your handkerchief to cover my&#xD;
r~eck with, for the wind is growing cool."&#xD;
Mary Winters's mind was naturally highly 'imaginative,&#xD;
and she had read most of the~high..wrought fictions of the&#xD;
period, and their extravagance and romance, acting on her&#xD;
susceptible nature, made her cpiite a sentimentalist. Rog-&#xD;
er's goodness of heart had won her esteem, and he had a&#xD;
wild dash of humor about him at times that amused her;&#xD;
but the occasional roughness of his remarks, so much at va-&#xD;
riance with the refinement of her feelings, shocked her, and&#xD;
caused her heart to recoil from his proffered kindness. He&#xD;
could scarcely have chosen a more inopportune moment for&#xD;
a jest in his peculiar style than the present. ills coarse-&#xD;
ness~wounded her sensibility ~,nd roused her pride,, which he&#xD;
perceived, and. said,&#xD;
"I hope~ you're not offended, Mary. I'd rather' die than&#xD;
see you look so angry. at me. I beg your pardon, if I've&#xD;
hurt your feelings. I hope you'll believe me when I swear&#xD;
I'd rather ~cut my right arm off than offend you. Come-oh&#xD;
come, Mary, and sit down again."&#xD;
Mary's nature relented at once, for there was an earnest-&#xD;
ness in his protestation that assured her that he meant no&#xD;
offense. She iesun~ied her seat, saying,&#xD;
"You often hurt me by your rough manner, Roger, though&#xD;
I know you don't mean to do so."&#xD;
A pause ensued. Mary glanced at the moon again; and&#xD;
Roger, anxious to offer some propitiation for his unintention.&#xD;
al offense, said,             -&#xD;
* "Isn't it a beautiful night, with the moon and the stars&#xD;
looking ~ew~i on the trees t~nd the river, and making every&#xD;
thing look so sweet and happy ?"&#xD;
Roger's remark touched Mary's sensibility, an&amp;amp; she for.&#xD;
gave' him for a thousand rn-timed jests he had ut~ered,&#xD;
"Oh, every thipg looks," she said, ~' as if this world was&#xD;
meant for angeIs~~i~d not for wicked man and~women. I'm&#xD;

look at the sky ~when the moon is shining, and not feel its&#xD;
magic."&#xD;
He bent his gaze earnestly on the fair face of his com-&#xD;
panion, and then. in a. softer tone, said,&#xD;
"My heart, Mary, is not hard; but if it was as hard as&#xD;
a, rock, you could make it as soft as a dove's. Oh, Mary,&#xD;
you can't tell how much I love you, and my heart would&#xD;
burst if I didn't tell you of it this moment."&#xD;
Mary blushed deeply, and her lover coughed, and both felt&#xD;
embarrassed. Rdger twisted and turned about, 'and then&#xD;
said, in a husky, hesitating voice,&#xD;
"I can't live without you any more than a flower can&#xD;
where th~un's light can't get to it. Will you pardon~aIl&#xD;
my offeu~es, and I'll try to please you and make you happy&#xD;
forever. IiLtary, there's a hard hand, but it's an honest one,&#xD;
~and if you'll take it, you will find it always a fast friend."&#xD;
Mary said nothing, but continued looking toward the ish&#xD;
and in the river, and Roger grasped the hand that was play-&#xD;
ing nervously with the end of her belt-ribbon, and&#xD;
to his lips passionately~.                  pressed it&#xD;
After they parted, Mary had many misgivings as to the&#xD;
propriety of what she had done. In Roger's integrity she&#xD;
had unwavering confidence; but she could not but be cOn-&#xD;
scions that between the dreamine'ss of her own mind and&#xD;
the coarseness of her lover's there was a serious incompat-&#xD;
ibility. Roger was very popular, and she had been urged&#xD;
to the course she pursued by the advice of her friends, who&#xD;
assured her thatlie posse~ed all the qualities desirable in a&#xD;
husband. Her intercourse with the Merediths, and'the friend-&#xD;
liness of their conduct toward her, had induced her to think&#xD;
herself superior to the majority of persons of h~r own rank;&#xD;
and she felt that if s~he married Roger, she would unite her&#xD;
fortunes with one ~ho was much inferior to herselfL The&#xD;
night ~tssed wearily with her; many tears bedewed her&#xD;
ul~eekaand an indefinite feeling of having done wrong op-&#xD;
pressed her, and ~nade her extremely unhappy.&#xD;
Very different was it with Roger. He felt completely&#xD;
happy. No shadows passed over the sunshine of his breast.&#xD;
As he went home un&amp;amp;er the light- of the moon, he xnanifest..&#xD;
ed his ecstasies by dancing an&amp;amp;capering about in a way be.&#xD;
coming only to lunatics, and lovers happy for the first time&#xD;
in the conviction thit.t the loveliest being in the world re-&#xD;
quites the ardor~ of their passions.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHArTER ~&#xD;
WHILE the events described in the preceding chapter were&#xD;
taldng place, Drayton' was sitting by the side of'Ellen Mer-&#xD;
edith, engaged in conversation. George had retired early in'~&#xD;
consequence 'of a slight indisposition, and the colonel had&#xD;
gone to. the library to hunt up one of Burke's celebrated&#xD;
speeches on American affairs, of which he had be~n;talking.&#xD;
They sat alone in the porch. The night was cal~n, cloud-&#xD;
less, and beautiful; the. moonbeams glistened on ~he vines&#xD;
that clustered in front of the porch like trellised-work. El-&#xD;
len's beauty was heightened by the beams which threw a&#xD;
shadow of romance on her features, and Drayton s~.t by,&#xD;
gazing at the fair girl admiringly. And then the beauty of&#xD;
every object in the landscape.-the hazy hill-the trees with&#xD;
their dark shadows sleeping on ~4he green sod-the glitter-&#xD;
ing surface of the river-.--spoke to their hearts and roused&#xD;
every sentiment.. Drayton's conversation was more fervent&#xD;
than usual; his cheek was flushed; his dark eye glowed,.&#xD;
and he ,seemedto be instinct with the spirit of the hour and&#xD;
the scene. He rose, and, leaning against one of the pillars,&#xD;
glanced rapidly over the prospect. Then elevating his eye&#xD;
to the mo6x~ he looked intently on its glorious form a mm-&#xD;
ute, and turned to his fair companion and said,&#xD;
"How calmly beautiful is this night! Yon bright moon&#xD;
is the very queen of enchantresses. She rules our spirits as&#xD;
she rules the tides of the ocean. It is in such hours as this&#xD;
that we throw aside the shackles of realities and revel in ro-&#xD;
mance. The hills and forests seem peopled with spi4~s, and&#xD;
our thoughts hasten to commune with them with an~eager-&#xD;
ness unknown to our intercourse with the -hackneyed men&#xD;
we meet. How beautiful-how dream-like is this scene!"&#xD;
"Why, sir, you are positively becoming poetical," said El-&#xD;
len, with a smile. She was surprised at his enthusiasm, as&#xD;
it was unlocked for from one who generally was so thought-&#xD;
fi4. Bllen's was a common mistake; for people mostly seem&#xD;
not to have noticed that the mind, is as changeable in its as-&#xD;
pects as is the faee of the heavens above them, and there-&#xD;
fore suppose that one Who is generally grave and reflective&#xD;

can not, even by accident, devi~te~ juto enthusi~p~i and wild-&#xD;
ness of thought. ~rayton was i~sua~ly dignifle4 but, when&#xD;
alone, he was the creature of his impulses, and his thoughts&#xD;
dallied with the stars and flowers, and his feelings bent to&#xD;
eve~ influence that appealed to them.&#xD;
"My heart is only echoing the brightness of this scene,"&#xD;
he returned, resuming his seaf by' her side; "and if my&#xD;
tong~ie happens~ to be clothed with poetry, you will recollect&#xD;
it is as responsive to the glorious influences of a&#xD;
this, as your 1~arp i~ to the touches of t~ie    like&#xD;
lingers of ~ts mis-&#xD;
"Do you see that old ruin on the Qpposite shore of the&#xD;
river ?" 'asked Ellen, after a moment's pause, directing his&#xD;
attention to the ruins of a large mansion, once the most splen-&#xD;
did of' all that adorned the banks of the river4 "There ro-&#xD;
mance and superstition are blended for you," she continued,&#xD;
"fox it has the reputation of being haunted, and most per-&#xD;
sons avoid it at such a time as this, as if it was the abode&#xD;
of alli~the pestilences~in the world."&#xD;
"How natural such fears are," said Drayton. "Let rigid&#xD;
and prosedoving philosophers deride such superstitions 'as&#xD;
much as 'they may, yet they cling to our minds as warmth&#xD;
does to the sunbeams. I am not free from such feelings, and&#xD;
there are times when I would be very unwilling to grope in&#xD;
the shadows of that old ruin."&#xD;
"You 'spo~ie of having visited our family burial-place this&#xD;
morning," said Ellen. "Well, I have been there, when. the&#xD;
zneoubeams seemed to sanctif~r it, and I fancied I could hold&#xD;
a more intimate communion with the spirits of'those whose&#xD;
bodies molder there, than I c~uld at any other season. I&#xD;
- suppose it 'was only a fancy which sprang from my super-&#xD;
stitous4 feelings. A mood of that kind sometimes comes over&#xD;
me like a cloud, and then I ~fancy I hear ~the voices of the&#xD;
dead blending with the sighing night-wind."&#xD;
As jEllen spoke,' her cheek became pale,' her eye grew&#xD;
wild; and her tones ~oftened 'down so as to be alixiost inau-&#xD;
dible. Drayton glanced at her face inquisitively for a mo-&#xD;
ment, and said,&#xD;
"You. speak of moods wliinh E have' often experienced,&#xD;
'1~iss M~redi~h. I have oftenfelt, in the stillness and repose&#xD;

me, I long 'for the excitements ofthe 'crowd, and dteam only&#xD;
of the lofty thought and noble deed 'that~ win ~the, laurel&#xD;
wreath. Why do not objects always produce the sanie:feel-&#xD;
ings? Why," continued f)rayton, becoming more' 'animated,&#xD;
"why do thoughts gush up like fountains, and 'the ~haart&#xD;
heave with wild emotions at times beneath 'the glory of the&#xD;
full-orhed moon, while at other times, when the moon is look-&#xD;
ing.' down on us with equal splendor, every feeling seems&#xD;
buried in the unsounded depths. of the so~4, and every thought&#xD;
that would soar falls like a crippled bird back to earth ?"&#xD;
"I have often reflected on the strangeness of such moods,&#xD;
returrred. Ellen, her cheek having regained 'its color while&#xD;
she listened to Drayton's animated voice. "Sometimes&#xD;
what we see enslaves every thought and feeling, and at&#xD;
other times our spirits spurn such bondage and ~iu~ph&#xD;
over the world around us. I have often felt, when~lights&#xD;
were glaring and 'friendly forms were dancing before me,&#xD;
that they could not amuse me.' Ny thoughts were wander-&#xD;
ing to other scenes, and instead of listening to the music&#xD;
sounding in my ears, I have seemed to hear only the winds&#xD;
rustling among the leaves of the forest, and instead of con-&#xD;
templating the brilliancy around me, my fancy has been&#xD;
away among the stars, and birds; and the rainbow in the&#xD;
dark cloud."&#xD;
"I never perplex myself with the effort to solve suclirid-&#xD;
dles," returned Drayton. - "I am satisfied to know that&#xD;
many mysteries surround. me, and' have no wish to under-&#xD;
stand or change them." ' -&#xD;
Drayton hesitated a moment, and then gazing on Ellen's&#xD;
beautiful brow; radiant in the moonbeams, continued,&#xD;
"I shall never forget how I used to be abstracted from all&#xD;
things around me. I -was once, Miss Meredith, engaged in&#xD;
a mechanical occupation which was extremely irksome to&#xD;
me. Its duties were like a mountain' on my heart. Well,&#xD;
often, when- my hands were busy, every thing near me was&#xD;
as completely unnoticed as if 'my spirit had- left my body:.&#xD;
While wieldingtlie implements if the craft, I have indulged&#xD;
many a glorious dream, and thought deeply on the careers&#xD;
of the great men of whom U had read: Or, in fancy, I'&#xD;
would visit a grov~i of beautiful trees, near a crystal stream,&#xD;
in which, with books for my companions, 'I had made many&#xD;

bveithe'pitge~ of philosophers and poets."&#xD;
rayton felt, muoh ex4arrassed while referring to the&#xD;
4ay&amp;amp;in the earlier part of his' life, but he was glad&#xD;
~ o~portiniity of inf6rming Ellen of what he knew&#xD;
she d soon learn from other sources.&#xD;
"~V~re ~you ever engaged in a mechanical occupation ?"~'&#xD;
ii~qnired Elleit, in a torte of surprise.&#xD;
"'yes," replied Drayton, with a smile and a lightness of&#xD;
m~,nn~r that conflicted with the sentiments he felt. "1 once&#xD;
was obliged, by the poverty of my father, to do as Roger Sher-&#xD;
man did; and as I once followed his example in making&#xD;
shoes, I hope to emulate the after part of his career also,&#xD;
and assist in making laws."&#xD;
He watched Ellen's face closely as he spdke, anxious to&#xD;
-discover the effect his statement had on her feelings. She&#xD;
~ said, much to his relief,&#xD;
"Many minds have shone brighter because of the early&#xD;
troubles and trials to which they were subjected. Some per-&#xD;
sons have a silly prejudice against those whose occupations&#xD;
are considered low, as if it was the employment that stamped&#xD;
- the impress on character. I have observed, however, that&#xD;
generally the pretensions of such persons are not above sus-&#xD;
picion, and they hope to avoid it by suspecting others. Gen-&#xD;
uine aristocracy does not consider any thing mean that is not&#xD;
vulgar, and vulgarityis by no means confined to the humbler&#xD;
walks of life."&#xD;
Noble girl, thought Drayton, to be thus superior to the&#xD;
vulgar herd who prate of aristocracy, He s&amp;amp;id,&#xD;
"I suppose my early occupation will cause some of igno..&#xD;
ble blood to sneer at me. If a person with all the 'blood&#xD;
of all the ilowards' in his veins had unfortunately ever&#xD;
made a shoe, such~ beings would affect contempt for him.&#xD;
For the good Opinion of sueli I am not desirous; and I&#xD;
shall pursue my course regardless of them, striving to ele-&#xD;
vate~ys~lf to an honorable reputation, when my early ex-&#xD;
perie'hce will be quoted and turned to my advantage'."&#xD;
"I have often 'thought," said Ellen, "that when a man&#xD;
has risen from obscurity to distinction, he must look back&#xD;
on his careerwith great delight. We, poor women, can only&#xD;
imagine, it is not for us to experience, such feelings."&#xD;
"But you can do more," returned Drayton; "you can&#xD;
make others deserve them. Many men owe their success to&#xD;
their~wives; and there' are but few situations in life in which&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
DKAYTON~&#xD;
wox~jien appear so lovely as when, like ministex~ing ang&#xD;
thq cheer tl~se ~they love en tojdare the world~ tevei~&#xD;
in their efforts to win the world's a4niir~tiou."&#xD;
"The majority of our sex," said Ellen, tIiou~ ~f&#xD;
"have pride, and that induces them to encourage th~.&#xD;
love to become renowned~ It is for man to pant ~r~'&#xD;
the heart of woman, more humble in its aspirations, craye~&#xD;
oniy love. It seems strange, too, that a woman should ert~~&#xD;
courage her husband to struggle for fame, as that~ struggle'&#xD;
must necessarily take his attention a great deal from her.&#xD;
self. But a devoted woman will make any sacrifice of her&#xD;
own feelings if it be necessary to the elevation of her hus-&#xD;
band. I suspect the wives of great men are generally proud.&#xD;
er of their husbands' reputations than they themselves are."&#xD;
"Arid a trui~-hearted husband," added Drayton, earnestly,&#xD;
"is quite as anxious to win fame on his wife's account as&#xD;
his own. Indeed, fame would not be worth the efforts it re-&#xD;
quires if it did not gladden the hearts of those we love; for&#xD;
who would strive for eminence if it gave joy to no one but&#xD;
himself? Who would wish for greatness if it must be soli-&#xD;
tary-...for glory, if it must be gloomy? I firmly believe that&#xD;
many of the transcendent efforts of men have been made&#xD;
more to bring the glow of pride, to the brow and the ~smiie&#xD;
of gladness to the lip of confiding woman than to lift up the&#xD;
individual that he may tower, like an unsunned Teneriffe,&#xD;
above the heads of others. Ah ~ Miss Meredith, the wreath&#xD;
of laurel which men place on the imperial brow of genius&#xD;
would be of but little vajue if the hand of woman did not&#xD;
entwine among its cold, green leaves the roses which are&#xD;
emblematic of her love."&#xD;
Ellen listened attentively to Drayton, for she loved to. con-&#xD;
verse with the high-hearted oxi such subjects, and he felt&#xD;
the flattery indicated by the deep 'interest legible in her face.&#xD;
"I fear you exaggemte the devotion of man's heart to our&#xD;
sex'; and ambition is genertilly considered a more selfish feel-&#xD;
ing than you represent it to be."&#xD;
"'There are many," he replied, "who struggle for majes-&#xD;
tic loneliness-for solitary grandeu1r-for unshareddominion;&#xD;
but I suspect the majority of aspirants regard success as de-&#xD;
sirable chiefly because it will gain them the praises of the&#xD;
lips they love."&#xD;
"And many think that fame is not worth the labor it '~&#xD;
costs," said Ellen.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Neither would it be," replied Drayton, "if it only iso-&#xD;
lated a man above the sympathies of)~iis fellows. The feel-&#xD;
ing that a~ man, experiences when he stands sublimely above&#xD;
others is a glorious one; but eminence, should be regarded&#xD;
as desirable principally because it afford~ one an opportunity&#xD;
of doing an incalculable good.., Fame, like faith, is best at-&#xD;
tested by geod works. I would much rather that my influ-&#xD;
ence should' survive than my name; but the struggle for&#xD;
fame is fraught with a thousand wildly-delighting excite-&#xD;
ments. Talk of the pale brow, the wasted cheek, the shrunk-&#xD;
en form, and the early death to one of the panting sons of&#xD;
genius, and he will tell you that he heeds them not. With&#xD;
eye intent on the brilliant 'summit before him, he thinks not&#xD;
of the pitfalls of death in his way. He thinks martyrdom&#xD;
in such a cause infinitely preferable to long life and inglori-&#xD;
ous, ease."&#xD;
"And would you pursue such a course ?" asked Ellen, in&#xD;
a low but earnest tone of voice.&#xD;
"Oh yes, even if the finger-post of death pointed along&#xD;
the way, 'and on it was inscribed, 'This road leads to the&#xD;
grave,"' said Drayton, as he 'brushed the waving locks aside&#xD;
from his brow. "I have laid my vow on the altar, and I&#xD;
would rather die than live to mourn the disappointment&#xD;
which would crush me if I were unsuccessful."&#xD;
"Anti you will win' the prize !" were the words which&#xD;
trembled on Ellen's lips, as she looked earnestly on Dray-&#xD;
ton's face, vivid with the rays of intense thought.&#xD;
Had Ellen been a younger and less cautious lady, she&#xD;
would have retired to her pillow that night with a more ten-&#xD;
der feeling for Drayton than the high admiration she ex-&#xD;
perienced. She had learned~ to control her impulses~ and&#xD;
suffered no feeling at variance 'with what, she considered&#xD;
propriety to aspire to the dominion of her heart. As it was,&#xD;
the tones of Drayton's voice rang in her ears, and she fan-&#xD;
cied that his' stern resolves would overcome every difficulty&#xD;
in hi~ path, and elevate him high in the regard of tIle world.&#xD;
Had she been less sensible, she would have loved what she&#xD;
admired; but she was one of those who do not suffer the&#xD;
crystal streams oftheir affections to flow forth unbidden, and&#xD;
perhaps unsought. ~he thought of Drayton as an aspirant,&#xD;
not.as a lover. ~he had seen much of distinguished men,&#xD;
and cherished a profound reverence for great intellectual&#xD;
ability. She' now looked upon Drayton as o~ of the most&#xD;
promising men she had ever met, and admired him for the&#xD;
stern and unflinching devotion of his heart to fame.&#xD;

Dr0yton admired Ellen the flint time he ~aw her, aiid ev-'&#xD;
ery succeeding observation deepened his regard for hor. He&#xD;
felt a growing attachment, and struggled to suppress it with&#xD;
a sigh. Most willingly would he have 'cherished love for&#xD;
her; most willingly would he have permitted every feeling&#xD;
of hi~ heart tQ be devoted to her, but he was convinced that&#xD;
in his present situation it would be highly improper. He&#xD;
glanced at the future 'with a hoping eye, and .r~solved on a&#xD;
stronger effort than ever, because he thought that, in addi-&#xD;
tion to its winning a reputation that would insure him suc-&#xD;
cess in his profession, it would please Ellen. When a youth&#xD;
determines to labor from such incentives, however much he&#xD;
may fancy to the contrary, the feeling of love is making in-&#xD;
sidious approaches toward the dominion of his heart.&#xD;
Next morning Drayton took a reluctant leave of Oakwood&#xD;
and returned to town. He purchased a few books and some&#xD;
furniture, and took possession of his office. In a few days he&#xD;
hung his "banner on the outer wall," by which passers by&#xD;
were informed that within was to be found an attorney at&#xD;
law.&#xD;
The first few weeks passed away very wearily. He ram-&#xD;
bled a1~out the streets and read by turns. He formed ac-&#xD;
quaintances with the occupants of the adjoining offices, who,&#xD;
being like the majority of persons who have but little to do,&#xD;
were very sociable, and much in the habit of inflicting their&#xD;
company on all the good-natured persons who would per-&#xD;
mit it.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
ABOUT two miles from Oakwood, toward the city, resided&#xD;
a gentleman of the name of Richard Randolph. His house&#xD;
was large and commodious; and celebrated for the splendid&#xD;
entertainment which visitors to it always met with. Mr.&#xD;
Randolph's eldest daughter, Caroline, returned home after&#xD;
an absence of two years spent abroad, during which period&#xD;
she had visited most of the remarkable places sought after&#xD;
by European tourists of that day. This event happened&#xD;
a1iout~a mouth after Drayton's 'first visit to Oakwood. 'Miss&#xD;
Randolph was a young lady of a highly-cultivated mind and&#xD;

&#xD;
manner, and prior to her departure ~he. had received the&#xD;
most flattering attentions in society. Her return was anx-&#xD;
iously looked for by many~ but by none with more eagerness&#xD;
than George Meredith, Who had culti'.~ated a close intimacy&#xD;
with her, and to whose society he had been indebted for&#xD;
many of the happiest days he had ever known. 'Indeed, it&#xD;
was suspected by many that the principal reason why Mr.&#xD;
Randolph had urged Caroline to go abroad was to dissipate&#xD;
the attachment which' she felt for George Meredith, and&#xD;
which he could not but observe. He was opposed to his&#xD;
daughter's uniting her fortunes with one whose health was&#xD;
so precarious as George's; and when a bachelor uncle spoke&#xD;
of making the tour of Europe, he insisted on her accompa-&#xD;
nying him, and pointed out the many advantages which&#xD;
would result from such a journey. Caroline consented to&#xD;
go, more from deference to her father's wishes than to grat~&#xD;
ify any desire she felt. George had never declared any thing&#xD;
like passion for her, and yet, when they parted, an observer&#xD;
might have perceived that both of them experienced the&#xD;
pang of regret most keenly.&#xD;
Immediately after her return, George called to ~ee her,&#xD;
fearing the effect that long absence and foreign scenes had&#xD;
exerted over her interest in himself. Much to his joy, he&#xD;
discovered that her mind had been greatly amplified by her&#xD;
observation of the scenes she had passed through, that she&#xD;
was still the sweet-hearted one in whom he had formerly&#xD;
taken so lively an interest, and that her sympathies for her&#xD;
former friend were as cheering as ever. He visited her fre-&#xD;
quently, ~and, when in her society, seemed to forget the in-&#xD;
firmities he labored under. His -friends observed the salu-&#xD;
tary change that came over him, and began to hope that his&#xD;
health, apparently so improved, might gradually be restored.&#xD;
Two months were passed since Miss Randolph returned,&#xD;
and George had experienced not only the restoration of all&#xD;
his' former friendship, but a stronger and more tender regard&#xD;
for her. That passion 'so mysterious, and in romantic na-&#xD;
tures so spiritual, which binds two hearts into one being,&#xD;
grew gradually upon him. He was surprised to find how&#xD;
all his own feelings were merged in his love for Caroline,&#xD;
and at times chided himself for his folly and weakness,&#xD;
which would not permit him to tear the feeling of love from&#xD;
his heart. At other times he flattered himself that his&#xD;
health was strengthening under the influence of his passion,&#xD;
which Weaned his thoughts from the cloud and gave them&#xD;
&#xD;
"4&#xD;
V&#xD;
'U&#xD;
&#xD;
to the sunlight; and the hope that he might still live to&#xD;
cherish his regard for her, took a deep hold: on his nature.&#xD;
Still, he resolved not to declare his passion until he felt such&#xD;
confirmation of returning health as to assure him that, in&#xD;
winning her heart, he would not peril her happiness.&#xD;
Caroline Randolph's complexion was of that rich, delicate&#xD;
brown, which characterizes the daughters of the South,&#xD;
shading, but not hiding the flusk of health that blooms upon&#xD;
the cheek. : Her dark eye was a mirror to her thoughts, and&#xD;
tOQk its character from the feelings she experienced, at times&#xD;
flashing with delight, and again dim and averted when she&#xD;
inclined to melancholy. She was tall and symmetrical-.&#xD;
winning in her manners-~.-and in every attitude and action&#xD;
displaying the graces of a cultivated lady. She was roman-&#xD;
tie, affectionate, and confiding. Her heart was pure, and&#xD;
her mind beaming with intelligence., From this imperfect&#xD;
description, it may easily be imagined- that, if she once gave&#xD;
her affections to any one, particularly to one like George&#xD;
Meredith, her devotion would be of that deep and holy kind&#xD;
which survives all change and circumstance, and yields to&#xD;
no power on this side of the grave.&#xD;
Two months, I have said, were passed since Miss Ran-&#xD;
dolph's return. It was a brilliant evening at the close of&#xD;
one of the last days of summer, and George Meredith sat&#xD;
near the adored of his heart. To his imaginative mind, the&#xD;
scene around seemed to breathe a pure atmosphere of love&#xD;
and peace. The air was balmy, and the ever-bright stars&#xD;
pursued their tranquil courses in the solemn depths of a sky&#xD;
as cloudless as an infant's brow. Not a sound, save the&#xD;
scarcely audible breathing of their own low, sweet voices,&#xD;
disturbed the silence of the hour.&#xD;
"Do' you remember," asked George, softly, while his eye&#xD;
was eloquent of unutterable fondness, "do you remember&#xD;
the last evening we spent together before you went away?&#xD;
How much like it is this? The stars were then glittering&#xD;
in the dephs of the moonless heaven, and all nature was&#xD;
hushed beneath 'the calm influence of night. How often-&#xD;
how often, Caroline, since then; when looking at the sky, I&#xD;
have thought of that happy yet most melancholy evening-&#xD;
melancholy, because I supposed it would be the last I should&#xD;
ever spend in your society.~~&#xD;
"Do you ask me if I remember that evening ?" returned&#xD;
Caroline, .in a; sweet, voice, and with a manner that mdi-&#xD;
- 'cated how fondly her thoughts flew 'back to the occasion re-&#xD;

'80                  DRAYTON.&#xD;
ferried to. "Oh! many a time, when the wide sea was&#xD;
spreadout between my heart and its native home, have I&#xD;
dwelt upon the recollections of that evening, until the tears&#xD;
would gather in my eyes, andl would weep like a silly girl,&#xD;
and scarcely know why I did weep. So ineffaceable is the&#xD;
impression of that evening's happiness on my mind, that, even&#xD;
if my memory was paralyzed, I do not think it' would all&#xD;
pass away. How melancholy your thoughts were! Do you&#xD;
remember them ?"&#xD;
"I was melancholy, Caroline, because I thought I looked&#xD;
upon your fair face and listened to your kind voice for the&#xD;
last time. How fondly, in our musin&#xD;
tinted, "do we again live        g moments," he con-&#xD;
over scenes once very dear, to our&#xD;
hearts! How often, when you were gone, I have delighted&#xD;
myself in recalling 'the hours, jeweled with joys,'spent with&#xD;
* you in rambling over field and forest, listening to the birds&#xD;
whose songs sounded like the echoes of your own sweet&#xD;
tones, and weaving chaplets of wild flowers for your brow!&#xD;
Were those not sacred hours, Caroline? Each and every&#xD;
one of them is pictured in my memory in hues as dazzling&#xD;
as the colors on the clouds of an October evening."&#xD;
"Mejnory gilds every-day facts and poetizes common oc-&#xD;
currences, but those were hours which well deserve the sane-&#xD;
~tification of song," returned Caroline, while her countenance&#xD;
reflected the romance of her thoughts. "You can scarcely&#xD;
conceive," she continued,-" of the deep, of the overwhelming&#xD;
influence which the remembrance of delightful scenes has&#xD;
,over the heart when it wanders far away from the home it&#xD;
clings to beneath foreign skies, and among strangers and&#xD;
strange things."&#xD;
George felt his heart swelling within him as he listened&#xD;
to her voice, so magical and so melodious in his ear, and&#xD;
gazed on the radiant brow and dark eye, which bespoke the&#xD;
iervor and the affection she experienced at that momeiit.&#xD;
With wildness and enthusiasm glowing in every lineament&#xD;
of his face, he said&#xD;
"Little, indeed, did I suspect, when the scenes we have&#xD;
referred to occurred, that I should ever hang over them with&#xD;
all the fondness the 'miser feels when hugging his gQld to&#xD;
his breast; and yet, when you were far away, every one of&#xD;
them became fixed like brilliant stars in memory's heaven,&#xD;
and I gazed. on them with all the rapt enthusiasm of the&#xD;
rersiau beneath the stirs he most loves. It was when re-&#xD;
calling those scenes, Caro~1ine, that I felt how dear~-.-how&#xD;
&#xD;
DItAYTON.           01&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
very dear, far beyond all my suspicions, you had been to&#xD;
me."&#xD;
He hesitated; his wan cheek glowed; his frame was' agi-&#xD;
tated, and his eye wandered as his love swept like a wild&#xD;
delirium over his heart. Scarcely knowing what he said, ho&#xD;
continued:&#xD;
"But clouds overshadowed my heaven, and every flower&#xD;
that blossomed in my path faded away as the conviction&#xD;
darkened on my mind that when you returned my heart&#xD;
would be beyond the reach of human 'trials. Contrary to&#xD;
my expectations, and at times contrary to my wishes, I lin-&#xD;
gered on. You returned, and with you came back hope and&#xD;
the feelings which I dared not speak of. Oh, Caroline, how&#xD;
II have struggled against the impulses that urged me to re-&#xD;
veal to you the depth of the unutterable fondness I cherished&#xD;
for you. You seem to possess a talismanic power over the&#xD;
tides of my soul, and they are obedient to no one but you.&#xD;
Your name is heard in my prayers. I breathe it in the&#xD;
hushed depths of my spirit oftener than the coming round of&#xD;
the hours. By day~ every tree I' see, and every wind, and&#xD;
bird, and stream I hear, conjures up 'before ~me some look,&#xD;
some wordsome grace of yours. In my dreams I hang over&#xD;
the transparent clearness of your brow, and seem to 'enjoy the&#xD;
heaven of your smile. It is wrong.-oh, it is sinful in one like&#xD;
me, whose unsteady nerves and faltering steps remind him&#xD;
so frequently that his- days are numbered, and that soon life's&#xD;
vesper bells will summon him to preparefor the unsunned&#xD;
gloom of the grave; it is very sinful in such a one to utter&#xD;
his passion in the listening ear of her who' is dearer than his&#xD;
words can express. But forgive me, Caroline; there is a fa-&#xD;
tality on me, forcing me to 'dedare how much I love you at&#xD;
this moment, and if I did not speak, my heart would burst.&#xD;
Yes, yes, dear girl, I love you devotedly-wildly, and, I fear,&#xD;
insanely. Like a maimed and shivering wretch of the old&#xD;
times, whose last act was to prostrate himself before the&#xD;
shrine of the Virgin and crave her mercy, I have brought&#xD;
my shattered constitution, yet glowing heart, to you, implor-&#xD;
ing your smile before I fade from human sight."&#xD;
He seized her hand and pressed it to his burning lips as&#xD;
a tear quivered in his eye. She gazed 'calmly in his face,&#xD;
and, smiling most kindly, said,&#xD;
"Be composed. You 'talk wildly Why should you thus&#xD;
torture yourself? I do love you-have loved you long, and&#xD;
D2&#xD;

82                    PRAYTON.&#xD;
would love you, even if the light of day was, for the last time&#xD;
glimmering in your shadowy eye."&#xD;
Wild was the meeting of their lips, gentle was the press-&#xD;
ure of her brow on his shoulder, and as h'oly as an evening&#xD;
in heaven was the silence that ensued. Never did two sin-&#xD;
less hearts unite in a sympathy more sacred-never did two&#xD;
noble and sweet natures blend more willingly together.&#xD;
When he retired to his chamber he took a seat near the&#xD;
window and looked out on the stars. His spirit was as shad-&#xD;
owless as the orbs that burned above him. He felt nothing&#xD;
but happiness, and to his fancy the gentle night-wind seemed&#xD;
to be responsive to the faint sounds of seraph harps, chant-&#xD;
ing to his heart the delights that the love of Caroline would&#xD;
henceforth shed upon him. Gradually a feeling of gloom&#xD;
came over his spirit as he thought that, however dear ~he&#xD;
might be to him, he would not long survive to enjoy the de-&#xD;
light of her communion. Before he retired he took up a pen,&#xD;
and with a fluttering heart wrote the following lines:&#xD;
We met in lifers bright morn,&#xD;
When every flower that blqssom'd in our way&#xD;
Flung forth its sweets into the lap of day,&#xD;
Without a shade or thorn.&#xD;
Then came the wild adieu,&#xD;
And soon between our hearts an ocean roared,&#xD;
But o'er its waves our thoughts, like glad birds, soar'd,&#xD;
Each to the other true.&#xD;
Oft in the lone, deep night,&#xD;
With brain grown weary o'er tile classic page,&#xD;
I turned to scenes more prized than lore of sage,&#xD;
And reveled in delight.&#xD;
For then I seemed to see&#xD;
Thy brow, like seraph's, bending fropi above,&#xD;
And thyusweet voice, whose every tone I love,&#xD;
Breathed round me melody.&#xD;
Although the grave's deep gloom&#xD;
Hung o'er my spirit like a somber night,&#xD;
One star high o'er it cheer'd my achiiig sight,&#xD;
Familiar with the tomb.&#xD;
Again we met~-thine eye,&#xD;
Lustrous with beauty and the light of thought,&#xD;
And lip with sezise, and song, and pathos fraught,&#xD;
Renewed my bosom's sigh.&#xD;
And must my bright dreams fade,&#xD;
Lik~e1ouds which melt upon a twilight heaven?&#xD;
And my fond hopes and glittering thoughts be driveti&#xD;
Into the tomb's deep shade?&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.            88&#xD;
&#xD;
~) I&#xD;
&#xD;
Alas! I bring thee~, love!&#xD;
A shattered frame which bends beneath the storm-&#xD;
A sicklied brow-a thin and wasted form,&#xD;
Meet fo~the clime above!&#xD;
Is it not madness, then,&#xD;
To wast&amp;amp; the streams of thy rich love on one&#xD;
Whose form may, like the rainbow's, soon be gone,&#xD;
Far from the haur~ts of men?&#xD;
lie handed these lines to Caroline the next morning when&#xD;
he w~s about starting. She read them eagerly, and, sigh-&#xD;
ing, approached him as he sat on: his horse. She placed her&#xD;
hand in his, and turning her glorious black eyes full on his&#xD;
'face, in a tone which was never forgotten by him, said,&#xD;
"And do you wrong me, George, by supposing that I could&#xD;
find in yout ill health a motive for alienating my heart from&#xD;
you? Oh, no! it only furnishes me with a reason why I&#xD;
shop.ld cling more closely-more devotedly to you."&#xD;
A tear stood in her eye, and.George pressed her hand, and&#xD;
turning his head away, said, in an under tone which came&#xD;
from the depths of his spirit,&#xD;
"You are kind and good-too kind, too good, Caroline."&#xD;
As he rode homeward, an electric thrill of joy pervaded&#xD;
his bosom as he dwelt on her deep devotion, and felt him-&#xD;
self to be its object. A cloud passed over the sunshine, of&#xD;
his breast as the probability of his early death came before&#xD;
him. The delights of the bridal and the gloom of the grave&#xD;
alternated on his mind. The angel-form of Hope would&#xD;
lead his fancy to the bowers of love, where Disappointment&#xD;
woula rear her form and mock all his joyous premonitions.&#xD;
Arrived at home, lie retired from the family, and spent&#xD;
the day, which was to him as fickle as an April one, apart-&#xD;
sunshine and shade chasing each other' over his mind, and&#xD;
by twns assuming the ascendency to resign it the next hour.&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
DItAYTON was sitting in his office one morning, soon after&#xD;
his return to town, poring over Coke, when some one en-&#xD;
tered, and, on lifting his eyes from the page before him, he&#xD;
behdd. the fine proportions of Mr. Edward Hampton.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Goo4, morning, Mr. Drayton. I give you joy, or, rather,&#xD;
I give the profession j~y on your acquisition to its ranks."&#xD;
"Thank you, sir," replied Drayton, handing him a chair.&#xD;
"Take a seat."&#xD;
Hampton took the chair, placed his feet on top of the&#xD;
table-pushing a law-book aside to make room for them-&#xD;
and then, taking a chew of tobacco, said,&#xD;
~' Have, you seen the fair lady of Oakwood lately ?"&#xD;
Drayto~i was musing on the independent, or, rather, im~&#xD;
pudent afr of his visitor, and scarcely understood the question.&#xD;
"No, sir. I've been there but once."&#xD;
"She's "a fine girl-a very fine girl-that Ellen Mere-&#xD;
dith is, sir," said Ha yawning. "I'm sleepy; I ought&#xD;
to be abed. I frolicked too late last night. If you are not&#xD;
made of coarser stuff, sir, than I think you are, you will be&#xD;
out at Oakwood again before 'long, and after that you will&#xD;
continue your visits regularly, for that's the fashion with the&#xD;
gentlemen who visit Ellen. 'Such a thing was never knoWn&#xD;
as a man's paying her but one visit."&#xD;
"I think it probable that I shall adopt the fashion," re-&#xD;
turned IDrayton, "for the good people out there are very&#xD;
much to my taste."&#xD;
"They are a fine family," said Hampton, stroking his&#xD;
whiskers lovingly, "a very fine family, sir. They only have&#xD;
~ fault that I know of, and in that they are better off than&#xD;
any of their neighbors-they're a little too Puritanical in&#xD;
their notions. A man has to take care what he says to&#xD;
them. If he says any thing silly, they think' him a fool;&#xD;
and if he doesn't square 'his conduct by the ten, command-&#xD;
ments as he would his cards by Hoyle, they frown on him."&#xD;
"I would esteem them the more for that course," said&#xD;
Drayton, emphatically.&#xD;
"I suppose it is right," yawned Hampton, "but its a lit-&#xD;
tle behind the times, sir. Now Ellen has such romantic&#xD;
notions about truth, hearts, and such things, that one can&#xD;
hardly get up a genteel ffiitation'with her. I tha)lk Heaven,&#xD;
sir, that all are not like her. Many of our woman-kind let&#xD;
a, fellow take some liberties with them, and that gives a&#xD;
zest to society. They like lovers, and never think of taking&#xD;
on after the manner of solemn-visaged Pharisees if one hap-&#xD;
pens to look and 'talk a little passion to them."&#xD;
"I love a lady whose self-respect frowns down imperti-&#xD;
nent farriiiiarity," said Drayton. "Miss Meredith is by lb&#xD;
means a stiff lady; and she acts very properly when sh~&#xD;
&#xD;
84&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.&#xD;
scorns the ninnies who would profess love for her in. a. way&#xD;
that would profane that passion."&#xD;
"She's not stiff, sir," replied Hampton, "but she is as dig~&#xD;
unified as Cornelia-as haughty as the mother of the U-racchi.&#xD;
There's a. little blue-eyed girl down town, with whom it's&#xD;
likely you'll meet, whose maimer is the reverse of Ellen's.&#xD;
There has been more hot breath poured into her ear than&#xD;
there ever were whispers into the Dyonisian ear. I made&#xD;
love to her the first time I saw her, and squeezed her hand&#xD;
in the most affectionate manner, and. you'd have thought,&#xD;
from her innocent looks, that she did not feel the gentle&#xD;
pressure in the least."&#xD;
Drayton was much amazed at his communicativeness, and,&#xD;
considering the slightness of their acquaintance, his famili-&#xD;
arity was decidedly premature. Hampton was one of your&#xD;
vain fellows, who, when they get to speaking of matters that&#xD;
concern themselves, talk on endlessly, without once stopping&#xD;
to reflect whether the taste of any one else is unlike their&#xD;
own or not. He was by no means eccentric, for he belonged&#xD;
to a. class whose name is legion, the members of which are&#xD;
to be met with every where.&#xD;
"I don't like your frigid girls," continued Hampton, "who&#xD;
are like icebergs, and chill every thing near them. I like&#xD;
your free and easy beauties, who don't stop to consider about&#xD;
propriety at every step. That same, propriety is a bore--a&#xD;
cursed bore, sir-.-.it interferes so deucedly with one's pleas.&#xD;
ures. There are a plenty of girls in this town who are as&#xD;
warm as a south wind, and, like that same south wind, they&#xD;
breathe warmth on every body."&#xD;
"Coldness is abominable in a woman," said Drayton, to&#xD;
continue ,the conversation in which his visitor appeared to&#xD;
take a very lively interest; "I do not fancy those ladies whose&#xD;
hearts, like the Baltic Sea, have no ebbs and, flows of pas-&#xD;
sio~l; but then I like dignity also, and think ,a lady lQses the&#xD;
~espect.of sensible men when she suffers her fascinations to&#xD;
be cheapened down to the level of the taste of every booby&#xD;
in society.",&#xD;
"I like your girls who are fond of flirtations," said Hamp-&#xD;
ton, caressing his nether lip between his thumb and fore-&#xD;
finger, and smiling amiably as the recollections of the many&#xD;
favors he had received from the sex rose before him. "I&#xD;
like a brilliant flirt-one of those sweet creatures who, ac*&#xD;
cording to Pope,&#xD;
'~tnile lute the sun, ahd smile on all alike.'&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7761-00000044"/>&#xD;
86                   DRAYTON~&#xD;
You don't have to swim through a whole ocean of common.&#xD;
places before you reach the haven of their good graces. I&#xD;
have one of that genus in my mind's eye now-~a very pretty&#xD;
girl, who gave a party to signalize the event of her coming&#xD;
out, one night last week~ She had just returned from board.&#xD;
ing-school, and I had never seen her before. By-the-way,&#xD;
sir, these boarding-schools are mighty tine hot-beds in which&#xD;
to plant girls, if you want to make passioft-flowers of them.&#xD;
Well, sir, I went to her party, and in one short hour after&#xD;
I had been introduced to her, I walked her out from among&#xD;
the crowd, and made all sorts of declarations to her and&#xD;
the sweet little creature fell on my breast as if Cupid's arrow&#xD;
had really pierced her sensitive heart."&#xD;
"Well, did you follow up the advantage you had gained,&#xD;
and propose for her hand ?" asked Drayton, innocently; for,&#xD;
his opinions being very old-fashioned, he did not fancy it&#xD;
proper to profess love without following with a matrimonial&#xD;
proposition.&#xD;
"Oh no, sir," laughed Hampton, wondering where Dray.&#xD;
ton could have lived. "We met, and laughed and talked&#xD;
the matter over.~~&#xD;
"Such ladies may be very pleasant sweet-hearts, but no&#xD;
man of sense would think of marrying one of them," said&#xD;
Drayton, quite thoughtfully. His experience in the fashion-&#xD;
able world had been extremely limited, and he was there-&#xD;
fore excusable for what Hampton at the moment considered&#xD;
ludicrous simplicity.&#xD;
"You talk. as old-fashioned as a resurrected mummy, Mr.&#xD;
Drayton," said Hampton, smiling at his greenness. "Devil&#xD;
the thought of matrimony ever entered a single crevice of my&#xD;
cranium. The 'old man, sir, has 'too few corner lots about&#xD;
toWn. The daughter 'is a splendid flirt, and makes a very&#xD;
agreeable sweet-heart. You'll meet her, and you'll know her&#xD;
by the large, languishing black eye she will be sure to ogle&#xD;
you with. She is a fine girl, sir. She has no prudence 'to&#xD;
freeze you. It's 'true, a~ Goldsmith says, the virtue that re-&#xD;
quires to be watched constantly is not worth the trouble of&#xD;
a sentinel."&#xD;
A girl with a pretty face and tawdry~ dress passed by,&#xD;
and glanced in as she passed. 'Hampton sprang up, seized&#xD;
his hat, arid left the office, saying,&#xD;
"Excuse niy abruptness, sir, I want to see where that 'girl&#xD;
goes.~~&#xD;
While Drayton was reflecting og the affectation and prof-&#xD;

D.RA Y TO N:&#xD;
&#xD;
{          legacy of Hampton, Colonel Meredith came in. They had&#xD;
been talking but a few minutes, when the colonel observed,&#xD;
"You have a' pleasant office, Mr. Drayton. It is prob-&#xD;
able you will wait a good while before you get into any&#xD;
thing like a profitable business; for young lawyers must feed&#xD;
is      on hope a long time, as the older ~members monopolize the&#xD;
profits of the profession.' A young lawyer should vibrate,&#xD;
like a pendulum, between the court-house and his office.&#xD;
In this way he gets acquainted with the mode ~6f doing busi-&#xD;
ness; and people, observing his regularity, will soon confide&#xD;
in him and give him soniething to do. While his probation&#xD;
continues, he should read-read extensively-.--not only law,&#xD;
but history, biography, and some fiction. These lighter stud-&#xD;
ies refresh and refine his mind. A lawyer can not know&#xD;
too much. The best lawyer at our bar is one of the finest&#xD;
scholars and shrewdest critics in the country.&#xD;
"How unjustly people suspect lawyers of dishonesty," said&#xD;
Drayton. "They will barely adnit the existence of an lion-&#xD;
est lawyer as a possibility, as if there were something indis-&#xD;
pensable to the profession that was peculiarly fatal to in-&#xD;
tegrity."&#xD;
Lawyers are the most slandered men in the community,"&#xD;
said the colonel. "The people seem to have forgotten the&#xD;
services that lawyers have rendered to the cause of liberty.&#xD;
If lawyers had not opposed the arrogant pretensions of the&#xD;
British crown, we might still have worn the British yoke.&#xD;
They incited' the people to rebellion, and when the war came&#xD;
on they were to be found in the field as well as in the Sen-&#xD;
ate. The Otises, the Henrys, the Rutledges, and a thou-&#xD;
sand other lawyers, had much to do in the achievement of&#xD;
our independence. In all revolutions 'two orders of men are&#xD;
needed, the active and the speculative. The speculative&#xD;
tion at issue, and demonstrating the value of the results&#xD;
mSh rouse the active by portraying the merits of the ques-&#xD;
that will ~flow from a successful prosecution of the enter-&#xD;
prise. Either of these classes of menbeing absent, the cause&#xD;
'could not progress. There are Adamses and Jeffersons to&#xD;
rouse the belligerent spirits, and Washingtons~ and ~reenes&#xD;
to marshal and lead them ou to victory. The populace award&#xD;
* th~ honors of a cause to the fighters for it, while those alc~ne&#xD;
'who k~ok beyond the flashing surface at the mighty, yet more&#xD;
recondite agencies at work, can discover the importance of&#xD;
'the speculative ~men who preached and pleaded the necessity&#xD;
Aef~~tesort to arms. A Continental Congress to do the think-&#xD;

ing was as necessary to the success of our Revolution as a.&#xD;

Drayton always listened with pleasure to the conversa-&#xD;
tion of Colonel Meredith, and the colonel was fond of talk-&#xD;
ing on subjects that engrossed much of iDrayton's thoughts.&#xD;
He always called on his young friend when he came to&#xD;
town, and sometimes sat for hours pouring forth the results&#xD;
of his reading and reflection into the eager ear of his listener.&#xD;
Drayton's eyes sparkled with delight whenever the tall and&#xD;
manly form of the colonel entered his office; for he passed&#xD;
many gloomy hours, and felt all that want of sympathy that&#xD;
a stranger among the hurrying crowds of a city must feel.&#xD;
During the day Drayton generally read or wasted an hour&#xD;
with some of the tenants of the adjoining offices. He fre-&#xD;
quently went to the courthouse to observe those With whom&#xD;
he was thereafter to come into competition to measure&#xD;
weapons in fancy with the most distinguished members of&#xD;
the bar, and to observe the peculiarities of their minds, as&#xD;
they were shadowed fGrth in their manner of advancing ~nd&#xD;
replying to arguments.&#xD;
At night he felt the lonesomeness of his condition very&#xD;
forcibly. He wandered about the streets, and when the&#xD;
light and joyous laugh of women, sitting near the windows,&#xD;
fell on his ear, the thought that among the thousand lovely&#xD;
beings by whom he was surrounded, there was not one who&#xD;
knew him, would sadden his heart. Occasionally he would&#xD;
stop near a house and listen to a song from lips that he fan..&#xD;
cied beautiful, and 'then the pang of solitude would, come&#xD;
upon him with intense power. A thousand times the form&#xD;
of Ellen Meredith came before his fancy, radiant with count-&#xD;
less perfection; and then he thought that if she but lived&#xD;
within the precincts of the city, his happiness would be in-&#xD;
sured. Manywere the nights~he thus spent walking about&#xD;
the streets, noticing whatever took place, looking up at the&#xD;
stars and dreaming of fame, or listening to woman's melo-&#xD;
dious voice, and dreaming of love.&#xD;
Alternating between hope and despondency, Drayton pass-&#xD;
ed his first'three months in his new abode. The little money&#xD;
he brought ~with him waS nearly exhausted, and no clients&#xD;
came with fees to replenish his beggarly. coffers. Still he&#xD;
hoped; and at times, when almost sinking under discour-&#xD;
agement, he would ride out to Oakwood, and, in friendly in-&#xD;
tercourse with the hospitable family of the Merediths, for-&#xD;
get his troubles. As Ellen's character developed itself, to&#xD;
&#xD;
~(&#xD;
y&#xD;
&#xD;
his view, he~ saw more and more to admire and love. She&#xD;
soon became necessary to his happiness. The feeling of love&#xD;
overshadowed, all other feelings of his heart; .but, he studied&#xD;
to conceal every manifestation of his passion from her ob-&#xD;
servation, and under a careless manner he effectually hid&#xD;
the burning sentiments of his heart, from her notice. At&#xD;
times he struggled against his passion, considering it w~ong,&#xD;
with such dark prospects before him, to cherish love for one&#xD;
who, like her, had never tasted the bitter cup of adversity,&#xD;
and whose every want had been lavishly supplied. In such&#xD;
conflicts between the feeling of love and his convictions of&#xD;
duties, he experienced many gloomy hours. Love some-&#xD;
times, like a dove, nestled gently in his heart, and again it&#xD;
would assume the form of the. vulture, beating his breast&#xD;
and battening on his blood. In his moments of desperation,&#xD;
when his proud soul rebelled against its bondage-when&#xD;
the beautiful pictures that fancy painted on the curtain of&#xD;
the future were shadowed as with the gloom of a night with-&#xD;
out stars-when those ethereal visitants, hope, love, and fame,&#xD;
fled.from his spirit, and demoniacal forms usurped their places&#xD;
-in such moments the chain of life galley him, and from the&#xD;
depths of his spirit came' the wish that he could take wings,&#xD;
and, soaring away from scenes of perplexity, be at rest.&#xD;
Such were his dark and doubting moments. But many&#xD;
were the hours of joy that lighted up the path before him;&#xD;
and with courage on his brow, and hope on his lip, he went&#xD;
gayly on, trusting that some circumstance auspicious to his&#xD;
success would occur to change the course of his fortunes,&#xD;
which thenceforth should flow on in the light 9f day and&#xD;
under a genial sun.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
"MARIA, have you seen the Mr. Drayton that Ellen Mer-&#xD;
edith was talking about ?"&#xD;
The speaker was Mrs. Willoughby, a lady of forty, with a.&#xD;
very unprepossessing exterior. She was a fat, dumpy woman,&#xD;
with a round face and huge red cheeks, indicating a sensual&#xD;
heart and, a pampered appetite. She was one of the most&#xD;
extravagant and dashing ladies in town. ~ShQ. was good for&#xD;

&#xD;
her accounts, and the merchants ~ll courted het~ She&#xD;
sported the finest carriage in the place, and her servants&#xD;
glittered in the richest livery. Her house was incompara-&#xD;
bly the most magnificent the city boasted. Every thing&#xD;
about it was decidedly elegant. Hers were the richest car-&#xD;
pets, curtains, and chandeliers..-and hers were the most&#xD;
costly Parisian tables, chairs; and lounges. Every thing&#xD;
about her establishment was extravagant; and Mrs. Wil-&#xD;
loughby had the honor ,of introducing the latest styles of&#xD;
*     dresses and dishes.&#xD;
By trickery, speculation, and all sorts of legal villainy, her&#xD;
father had accumulated a vast estate and a damning re~u.-&#xD;
tation. She was his only daughter. Mr. Willoughby was&#xD;
a dissipated, fashionable young man, who had spent his own&#xD;
patrimony without exhausting his profligate passions. He&#xD;
was sighing for another fortune when he met his future&#xD;
wife. He soon proposed for her hand, and married her.&#xD;
Mrs. Willoughby's guardian, . foreseeing consequences, had&#xD;
sense enough to secure to her one half of her magnificent&#xD;
fortune, and the other half, being placed in her lord's hands,&#xD;
was soon scattered to the four winds. She had ample means&#xD;
left, and supplied her husband, between whom and herself&#xD;
the smallest conceivable amount of affection subsisted, lib-&#xD;
erally with the means of gratifying his tastes. He wisely&#xD;
left her to take care of herself. Their children were grow-&#xD;
ing up, sadly neglected by both parents, and under the in-&#xD;
flu~rice of the most vicious examples. But that was a mat-&#xD;
ter of slight concernment to their parents: the one dashed&#xD;
and was envied, the other frolicked and played-and both&#xD;
were satisfied.&#xD;
The person addressed by Mrs. Willoughby was her daugh-&#xD;
ter, a young lady of eighteen. She was a gay, passionate,&#xD;
coquettish girl, with a pretty blonde face. Her roguish eyes&#xD;
were blue, and her simpering lips were the pure vermil of&#xD;
health.&#xD;
"Yes, ma," she answered;" Mr. Hampton pointed him out&#xD;
to me yesterday in the street, and he is, oh! such a fine-look-&#xD;
ing gentleman."&#xD;
"Well, you must invite him to your party," said the ami&#xD;
able mother; "and doti't forget to tell your father to call on&#xD;
him this very evening."&#xD;
"I will, ma, for I'm dying to get acquainted with him&#xD;
Ellen says he is so smart and gentlemanly."&#xD;
"If he is suel~ a man as Ellen described, I wish you would&#xD;
&#xD;
wi~z him," added the mother, "for you kiiow, my dear, I was&#xD;
always in favor of your marrying a gentleman of talents."&#xD;
Mrs. Willoughby was celebrated for her parties. They&#xD;
were the most splendid in town. Every body that was in.&#xD;
vited went to them to see every body else. The eatables&#xD;
and drinkables were always of the best, and in great abund-&#xD;
ance. If you want ten thousand friends, just cause your&#xD;
tables to groan with good things, and you will, have them.&#xD;
This prescription has been tried in innumerable instances,&#xD;
and there is not a case of failure on record.&#xD;
Mr. Willoughby called on Drayton. An invitation was&#xD;
Bent, and Mr. Hampton kindly offered to accompany him and&#xD;
present him to the ladies.&#xD;
The night came. It was glorious. It was neither too&#xD;
hot nor too cold. The weather was of that interestingly du-&#xD;
bious sort which leaves you nothing to hope or fear from it.&#xD;
It was most admirably adapted to colloquial purposes. You&#xD;
were not forced to swear at it, or to compliment it with a&#xD;
dewy brow or an aching toe. The moon and stars, poor&#xD;
dim luminaries, did their utmost to get up a luster out of&#xD;
doors for the plebeians, equal to that which dazzled the eyes&#xD;
of the patricians in Mrs. Willoughby's parlors. But it would&#xD;
not answer; and the serene poetry of the heavens was voted&#xD;
second to that whose influence was felt in the crowded apart-&#xD;
ments.&#xD;
As they entered the hall, Drayton's nerves were slightly&#xD;
agitated, for he had, unfortunately for his knowledge of the.&#xD;
world, lived without the sacred limits of fashion, and, of&#xD;
course, knew nothing. He had never been at one of those&#xD;
splendid assemblages, where the fountains of human wisdom&#xD;
perpetually play, where impudence stares at worth and&#xD;
wonders how in the deuce it got there, and sound is con-&#xD;
sidered the best substitute in the world for sense.&#xD;
Clinging to Hampton's arms as his only means of salva..&#xD;
tion, Drayton wound through the crowd of beauties and&#xD;
dandies. He felt a very comfortable degree of resignation&#xD;
to his fate, for his poor senses were quite overcome by the&#xD;
intense brilliance that dazzled his eyes, and the sounds that&#xD;
quite stunned his ears.&#xD;
"Yonder she stands," shouted Hampton, in Drayton's ear,&#xD;
as the dumpy form of Mrs. Willoughby greeted his vision.&#xD;
After much labor they reached the lady. Drayton was&#xD;
introduced-he made abow-.-said nothing, because he did&#xD;
not know what to say~-..wiped the perspiration from his brow,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
and retired from her august presence. He was soon fortu-&#xD;
nate in finding a vacant, corner, whare he folded his arms,&#xD;
recovered the control of' his eyes, and began to observe the&#xD;
mass of beings crowding each other before him. Every body&#xD;
there would have pronounced poor Drayton decidedly green,&#xD;
if every body had only known what he was thinking as he&#xD;
stood in the corner calmly surveying the scene. 'But, for-&#xD;
tunately, a philosopher can fold his arms in such crowds and&#xD;
think as he pleases, and the fools fluttering.before him have&#xD;
not the sagacity. to read the language of his feelings.&#xD;
But to resume. Drayton stood for some time looking at&#xD;
sundry ladies who were dancing before him. His philosophy&#xD;
soon began to thaw beneath the brilliant glances of beauty,&#xD;
and he actually felt a strong desire to become acquainted&#xD;
with some of the fair beings. There was one young lady&#xD;
in particular who claimed his attention, with whom he ex-&#xD;
changed looks several times. She was dancing with great&#xD;
spirit, and carrying on flirtations with two or three dandies&#xD;
near her. As he was wondering how he could get acquaint-&#xD;
ed With her, Hampton came up, and he asked him if he&#xD;
knew who that pretty lady was.&#xD;
"Yes; that's Miss Willoughby. She wants to see you.&#xD;
You have been playing the wall-flower long enough."&#xD;
They again elbowed their way through the crowd, and&#xD;
Hampton introduced Drayton to Miss Willoughby.&#xD;
"You are a stranger in-our city,' Mr. Drayton," she said,&#xD;
glancing timidly at his brow, and then modestly dropping&#xD;
her eye toward a brilliant bouquet she held in her hand.&#xD;
Half a dozen gentlemen here gave way, and Drayton ap-&#xD;
proached nearer to the lady as he replied,&#xD;
"I am., Miss Willoughby."&#xD;
".1 heard Miss Meredith speak of you," she said, suddenly&#xD;
becoming quite, courageous, and lifting her bright 'blue eye&#xD;
from her flowers to his face. "By-the-way, sir, she is a&#xD;
most partial friend of yours, for she spoke in the highest&#xD;
terms of you."&#xD;
If you want to please a stranger, 'put him into a particu-&#xD;
larly good humor with himself first, and his benevolence will&#xD;
become so expansive as to include you Without an effort.&#xD;
Miss Willoughby practiced this rule on all occasions, and, in&#xD;
her opinion, it was infallible. As she spoke, a very par-&#xD;
ticularly long and slender yoi~th. came up and asked her to&#xD;
honor him with 'her hand for th~ dance. "I am engaged&#xD;
for the next eight sets, Mr. Smith, and I shall ha'~re the ex-&#xD;
&#xD;
quisite pleasure of dancing the ninth with you," and, as she&#xD;
concluded, she wrote his name on a card, and Mr. Smith&#xD;
went off in an ecstasy of delight.&#xD;
"Can you look unmoved on such charms as Miss Mere-&#xD;
dith's ?" inquired Miss Willoughby, resuming the conversa-&#xD;
tion which h4d been interrupted by Mr. Smith.&#xD;
"Such coldness and unsusceptibility, I am happy to say,&#xD;
are not mine," returned iUrayton.&#xD;
"She was telling me about a morning ride she had with&#xD;
you, Mr. Drayton. I suspect such things are pleasant, but&#xD;
I can't get up early enough to enjoy. them.'~&#xD;
"You should resemble Venus more early than' you do,&#xD;
if you would be a morning as well as an evening star," said&#xD;
Drayton, as he gazed in her bright face with an eye eloquent&#xD;
of admiration.&#xD;
A youth, with a waspish waist and pretty face, here came&#xD;
up and claimed Miss Willoughby's hand for the dance. She&#xD;
plucked a rose from her bouquet as she was leaving, and, ex-&#xD;
tending it toward Drayton, with an arch look, said,&#xD;
"Wear that for my sake, sir."&#xD;
Drayton took the flower and bowed, and the lady's slight&#xD;
form was soon lost in the crowd.&#xD;
"That's a very pretty girl," thought he, as his eye fol-&#xD;
lowed her; "but if she is not an arrant coquette, then I am&#xD;
no judge of womankind."&#xD;
He went into another room, and the first lady he saw&#xD;
dancing was Ellen Meredith. She was dressed in white,&#xD;
and wore a white rose in her dark tresses. As he stood&#xD;
watching and admiring her graceful motions, a hand was&#xD;
placed ~oftly on his shoulder, and,~ turning, he saw George&#xD;
Meredith at his side.&#xD;
"A moat agreeable surprise," said Drayton, warmly, grasp..&#xD;
ing h s hand.&#xD;
." I ,do not often visit such places," said George. "Ex-&#xD;
citement' injures me. But 1. knew sister Wished to come,&#xD;
and she would not come Without me.&#xD;
Drayt6n's attention wa~s attracted to a lady of great beau-&#xD;
ty who was dancing .near, and. after looking at her for some&#xD;
time, he asked,&#xD;
'.' Who: is that lady in' black velvet? ' She glances very&#xD;
frequently and .very ~indly at you."&#xD;
"That lady," returned George,' " is 'Caroline Randolph.&#xD;
She has a very' sweet face, and it is the index of as sweet a&#xD;
heart' as was ever lodged in woman's breast."&#xD;

&#xD;
He hesitated a rnome~it, and then continued: "1 will teU&#xD;
you what I would tell to but few persons; that lady and&#xD;
myself have long been intimate, and between us there is&#xD;
great sympathy of soul. She is the one particular bright&#xD;
being who dawns on my fancy as shadowless as a star.&#xD;
She," he added, his voice sinking to a'whisp9r, "is my be-&#xD;
trothed."&#xD;
Drayton was not prepared for. such a revelation; and&#xD;
George, observing his surprise, continued,&#xD;
"I have no doubt that, after hearing me express the con-&#xD;
viction that I am one of the early doomed, such a confession~&#xD;
from my lips astonishes you. Our love commenced several&#xD;
years ago, when my health was better than it is now; but&#xD;
I fear it will never be consummated on this side of the&#xD;
grave."&#xD;
His voice faltered as he spoke, and Drayton, feeling the&#xD;
delicacy of the occasion, said nothing, while a sigh escaped&#xD;
his breast.&#xD;
"Accompany me, and I will introduce you to her," said&#xD;
George, taking his friend's arm.&#xD;
Drayton soon left Miss Randolph and her lover, and went&#xD;
to pay his respects to Ellen. When he was gone, Miss Ran-&#xD;
dolph took George's arm, and said,&#xD;
"Lead me to a seat; I will dance no more to-night. You&#xD;
look pale. You have been too much excited. Let us sit&#xD;
down."&#xD;
"I love to see you among the fairest of your ser," he said,&#xD;
when they were seated, "for -then your loveliness shines pre-&#xD;
eminent over all others. And then, when I think that all~&#xD;
the hoarded alThctions of the one whose brilliance is' height-&#xD;
e~zed, not dulled, by comparison, is mine, I am almost over.&#xD;
powered by my sensations."&#xD;
"I am extremely happy," she returned, "in reciproc'ati~tg&#xD;
such feelings., And 'oh, George! if Heaven. would but be&#xD;
merciful to me,~ and restore your health, I should be the hap'&#xD;
piest being below the Btars."&#xD;
"And to Onjoy .the bliss of your love, Caroline, is what I&#xD;
particularly desire to live for. I hope to live many years fot&#xD;
your sake."&#xD;
The mists rose to her eye as she listened to his soft and&#xD;
melancholy tones. With much emotion, she said, -&#xD;
"" ~J'a1k no more in that doubting strain. Let the cheer.&#xD;
ing~~~~ce of Hope still 'lull all my fears to repose."&#xD;
Her ~ye glistened through its mists, 'and the rays of hope&#xD;
&#xD;
ble~nded'with her smiles as she spoke. Alas! sweet girl, to&#xD;
'hope when the flush of life's setting sun is on the cheek of&#xD;
the one you love, is, of all love's proofs, the most trying.&#xD;
Hope on-hope on; and though the star you love shall sud.&#xD;
denly sink, like ,a meteor, below the horizon, and a long, long&#xD;
night of desolation ensue, yet while its beams are still bright&#xD;
above you, the delusion you cherish is a most consoling one.&#xD;
The angel form of Hope may smile on the verge of the grave,&#xD;
but 'when it disappears beneath the cold green sod, who may&#xD;
estimate the bitterness and the gloom that come down on&#xD;
the too credulous heart?&#xD;
"I am glad to see you enjoy yQurself," said Ellen, when&#xD;
Drayton, after much labor, had' pressed through the crowd,&#xD;
and stood by her side.&#xD;
"It is a habit of mine to enjoy myself when so near you,"&#xD;
returned Drayton. "Alas !" he added, "I can not partici-&#xD;
pate in the pleasure that has heightened the bloom on your&#xD;
cheek, and I must stand off and envy happier fellows than I&#xD;
am."&#xD;
"I~o you not dance, Mr. Drayton ?"&#xD;
"No; I do not know one step from another; and if I did,&#xD;
I should fear to enter the 'lists, where beauty awards the prize&#xD;
to gracefulness."&#xD;
"I suspect, sir, if the truth were k~iown, it would appear&#xD;
that you consider dancing too undignified a pleasure for one&#xD;
who aspires to the delights of philosophy," said Ellen, gayly.&#xD;
"A pleasure which Miss Meredith's superior judgment ap-&#xD;
proves may not be considered undignified by me," returned&#xD;
Drayton.&#xD;
"I will not -contest that point with you," she said; "but,&#xD;
sir, what do you think of the beauty of our city? Are you&#xD;
heart-~whole yet ?"&#xD;
Drayton shrugged his shoulders and sighed, and she con.&#xD;
tinted. "Caught at last, Sir Stoic! Well, ~aat lady of my&#xD;
acquaintance shall I congratulate on having made a conquest&#xD;
of your fastidious fancy?"&#xD;
'KDoes Miss Meredith ask that question seriously ?"&#xD;
"Tudeed I do, sir, for I have some curiosity to know."&#xD;
~' You are gay this evening," ~aidDrayton. "Well, gay.&#xD;
ety becomes one who shines in this brilliant crowd like Sirius&#xD;
among the fixed stars."&#xD;
"Thank you, sir," she returned; "and if I am Sixins~ -of&#xD;
which of the hisser 'stars have you ~been taking astronomical&#xD;
observations'?"&#xD;

"I see but the brightest; but, unfortunately, I ~iave to&#xD;
worship at a distance. Do you dance all the evening 'I"&#xD;
"I am growing weary, and. mean to retire after' the next&#xD;
cotillion."&#xD;
"And shall it be' my happiness to provoke the jealousy of&#xD;
all these graceful gentlemen by leading you from the dance&#xD;
when you are wearied ?"&#xD;
Ellen smiled assent; and the music called her attention&#xD;
from Drayton to her partner, who had been trying to attract&#xD;
her attention for some time by clearing his throat and jerk-&#xD;
ing his body nervously, in front of her.&#xD;
Drayton stepped aside, and watched Ellen as she.. wound&#xD;
gracefully through the mazes of the dance. He was quite&#xD;
abstracted, when a gay voice at his side attracted his no-&#xD;
tice.&#xD;
"By all that's proper, now, I vow here stands Mr. Dray-&#xD;
ton, looking like a philosopher in the presence of beauty."&#xD;
The ~voice was Miss Willoughby's, who was hanging care-&#xD;
lessly on Hampton's arm.&#xD;
"I did not think beauty was so near me, or abstraction&#xD;
would have given way to admiration."&#xD;
The pretty creature smiled most brilliantly, and for a mo-&#xD;
merit hung her head, as if overcome by a sense of unworthi-&#xD;
ness. Suddenly she glanced at him, and said,&#xD;
"A pretty flower for your thought, sir, when I interrupted&#xD;
your brown study."&#xD;
"I was thinking of the fairest lady in this company," he&#xD;
answered.&#xD;
"And who was so happy as to engross your thoughts ?"&#xD;
"Excuse me if I breathe not her name," he replied; "for&#xD;
personalities are decidedly improper here," he concluded, with&#xD;
a look that assured Miss Willoughby that' she was the lady&#xD;
in question~&#xD;
"Here's th~flower, sir; you fairly deserve it, for that is&#xD;
incomparably the most unconscionable compliment I have&#xD;
received to-night."&#xD;
As she handed the flower, Hampton said,&#xD;
"Well, now, I'll swear, Miss Willoughby, you compliment&#xD;
him at my expense, for I've been uttering nothing but soft&#xD;
and kind words in your ear all the evening."&#xD;
"Yours were the softest, but this gentleman's were the&#xD;
sweetest," she'answered, glancing from Hampton to Drayton.&#xD;
"By-the..way,'. sir," she continued, addressing Drayton, "I&#xD;
hve not seen you practicing the graces to-night'&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.           97&#xD;
&#xD;
" I ~rn n&amp;amp;t a master in that line, and know myself too well&#xD;
to run the risk of becoming ridiculous.&#xD;
Miss Willoughby was soon surrounded' by a host of admir-&#xD;
ers, comprising an exquisite assortment of dandies, and other&#xD;
interesting gentlemen in aspiring shirt collars, who made sun-&#xD;
dry most apposite and extremely brilliant remarks about her&#xD;
bouquet, and the air of happiness that prevailed over the com-&#xD;
pany.' The lady was exceedingly gracious. She distributed&#xD;
her fiLvors with admirable tact and impartiality. To a senti-&#xD;
mental-looking gentleman, who was a ninety-ninth~rate poet,&#xD;
she made a quotation from one of his own execrable dog-&#xD;
gerels; 'and to a weak and slender coxcomb she administered&#xD;
a cordial in a complimentary remark she made about the ex-&#xD;
quisite tie of his cravat. 'She pleased a presumptuous fool&#xD;
by smiling on him at a distance; and she made a tast friend&#xD;
for life of a shy, awkward youth, by telling him he was the&#xD;
most happy-looking man she ever saw in a crowd. They&#xD;
thickened around her; but the lady's conversation was like&#xD;
a fountain flashing all day in the sunlight, and she had a&#xD;
brilliant smile and a cordial drop for every one. All were&#xD;
happy; and if philanthropy is to be estimated by the amount&#xD;
of pure, unalloyed delight its proprietor confers on the ste-&#xD;
cies, Miss Willoughby was certainly one of the most philan-&#xD;
thropic ladies in the world.&#xD;
Drayton stood by, and was highly amused as he watched&#xD;
Miss Willoughby, and observed how happy she made a dozen&#xD;
youths in five minutes. At that rate, he calculated, she&#xD;
could imparadise a thousand sentimental young gentlemen&#xD;
in a day; and he had no doubt ~he could have accomplished&#xD;
such a benevolent undertaking with ease, and, moreover,&#xD;
have slept comfortably and dreamed of menageries all night.&#xD;
Drayton abstracted Miss Meredith from the crowd, to the&#xD;
sad annoyance of sundry exquisite who besought her hand&#xD;
for the dance. The lady wa~ unrelenting, and the exqui-&#xD;
sites looked sullen, while Drayton, with an air of triumph,&#xD;
led her off into a corner, where he kept possession of her ear&#xD;
until supper was announced.&#xD;
The supper was magnificent, and the tables were re-&#xD;
lieved of a portion of their loads in a marvelously short&#xD;
time by the five hundred famishing beings who crowded&#xD;
round them. The ladies ate cakes and candies, sipped&#xD;
creams and jellies; while the more knowing fellows, ~ho&#xD;
had more appetites than gallantry, and who were too wise&#xD;
to escort ladies to the supper-room, waged a war of exterm-&#xD;

Champagne bottles were emptied with remarka'hle facility,&#xD;
and then the supper was over; and the crowd reassembled&#xD;
in the p~ir1ors, where the music struck up a tune, and pretty~&#xD;
ladies and slende~ dandies were soon seen floating mely&#xD;
about, to' the great delight of Terpsichore and a few other&#xD;
ladies that looked on.&#xD;
CHAPTER XYII.&#xD;
"HAVE ~OU been at Oakwood lately ?" inquired Doctor&#xD;
Macdonald, as he sat in his easy chair, reposing his gouty&#xD;
foot tenderly on a soft cushion. The doctor's disease was&#xD;
particularly obstinate, and instead of getting better, he swore&#xD;
it grew worse every day.&#xD;
"It has been about two weeks since I was there," replied&#xD;
Drayton.&#xD;
"Two weeks !" ejaculated the inestimable uncle, looking&#xD;
as~-much astonished as if the earth had yawned before him.&#xD;
"Two weeks! why, that's a full generation in a lover's chro-&#xD;
nology. I thought yoi~ told me you loved Miss Meredith&#xD;
very much!"&#xD;
"I do consider her a very superior lady," returned Dray-&#xD;
ton, "but it does not follow that I ought to go to see her&#xD;
every day on that account."&#xD;
The uncle was very anxious that the nephew should&#xD;
marry Miss Meredith, as he supposed such an act would be&#xD;
a vastly fine speculation, and he wanted Drayton to become&#xD;
independent, as he feared that otherwise he might trouble&#xD;
him 'with importunities. The apparent indifference of his&#xD;
nephew to such a golden opportunity always irritated the&#xD;
worthy uncle, who considered lukewarmness in such an en-&#xD;
terprise altogether unpardonable.&#xD;
Remember, bay, she's a fair girl, and will make yetl an&#xD;
uncommonly snug wife; but you must also remeni'b~t that,&#xD;
to win her, you will have to be much smarter than you have&#xD;
been yet."&#xD;
1)rayton disliked talking with him on such a subject~,and&#xD;
very coolly returned,.&#xD;
&#xD;
1'&#xD;
"I&#xD;
&#xD;
"'I h~ve' not tried to win, her, else I would have been as&#xD;
smart as you could desire.&#xD;
"Not tried !" vociferated 'the doctor; "why, you unmiti-&#xD;
gated gander! while you are deliberating about the matter,&#xD;
some shrewder fellow will slip in and bear off 'th~rize;&#xD;
and, 8uch don't come up every day in the lottery~ of human&#xD;
fortunes."&#xD;
"Then that shrewder fellow will get a very fine wife,?'&#xD;
said Drayton, yawning, as if he waa the most unmercifully&#xD;
bored of men.&#xD;
"A fine wife! Just think of the Oakwood estate, to say1&#xD;
nothing of one of the prettiest and most highly accomplished'&#xD;
women in the state !"&#xD;
The doctor twitched about, and was evideni~y becoming',&#xD;
nervous as he thought of the pre-eminent follyibf his irre-&#xD;
claimably silly nephe~(r. The old gentleman ~ looking&#xD;
earnestly in his face, when Drayton smiled, as if~tt~ scene&#xD;
was not half so serious as the doctor esteemed it '.~4'~e old&#xD;
gentleman's brow darkened, and he looked as ifhe was~bout&#xD;
hurling a blasting thunder-bolt at his nephew. His feAgres&#xD;
were slightly relaxed as he 'said;~&#xD;
"You're a pretty ass, to let such an admirable O~~O1~1flfl..;&#xD;
ty of making yourself comfortable for. life slip through yoi~&#xD;
fingers! Well, I always did believe ~s much in the blood.&#xD;
of men as in that of horses. Why, sir, if your gr~ndfa~ther's&#xD;
ghost was to rise from the grave and take flesh,' it would act&#xD;
in every respect as ~you do. What are you,' waiting&#xD;
You say you like the girl ?"            ,     g~ 'for?&#xD;
"I am waiting to get into business which will justify mat-&#xD;
rimony before I seriously indulge in thoughts of marriage&#xD;
with any one," returned Drayton. "Besides, sir, I have not&#xD;
half so flattering an estimate of my powers of pleasing as you&#xD;
seem to have, and am therefore by no means certain of ~uc-&#xD;
cess if I were to try 'to win Miss Meredith's affections.".&#xD;
"What have you tQ fear ?" inquired the. doctor, earnestly.&#xD;
"Why, boy," he continued, lowering the tones of~his voice&#xD;
i~ntil they becai~ne quite gentle, "why, you're a good'looking&#xD;
fellow; you are gifted with the Macdonald eye and a fine&#xD;
mind; ~ withal, your maiuier is highly genteel. And&#xD;
whatm~re 'would you have? Don't you know, sir, that no&#xD;
wom~u, 'under heaven was ever known to resist the combi-&#xD;
'nation of such qualities in one person? If ~he doesn't sin'-&#xD;
render at once, don't give up the siege on that account. No,&#xD;
sir, don't think of giving up; but the more difficulties you&#xD;

r4eet must only incense ~our' ardor the more. Keep up ~.&#xD;
b~isk fire, and the enemy i~ yours. Take my advice; be vig-&#xD;
ilant, be bold; push your suit vigorously, and, my life on it,&#xD;
the Oakwood estate will be yours."&#xD;
Th&amp;amp; worthy gentleman stopped for want of breath, and&#xD;
while he was recovering. ~iis wind, Drayton smiled and' said,&#xD;
"My dear uncle, you SE em to think that the estate is the&#xD;
main thing to be looked at and courted. Now I confess,&#xD;
however silly it may seem to you~ that if I were to court any&#xD;
thug, it would be the fai~' lady herself, for I lack the power&#xD;
to fall in love with aA estate."&#xD;
"Fudge! The estate s worth more than any woman in&#xD;
the four continents; and this one is particularly' desirable,&#xD;
for, in case you should wn it, its mistress could scarcely be&#xD;
considered an ineumbrane s."&#xD;
The doctor took a pinc~ t of snuff, and as he gave it to his&#xD;
nose~ he kept his. lively little eyes fixed on Drayton's face.&#xD;
The nephew, instead oflooking thankfully at his uncle for&#xD;
the advice he was so kindly administering, was glancing up&#xD;
at a Canary-bird that Wa; singing away lustily in his cage.&#xD;
"I suppose, however, y~u would wait to get in love," add-&#xD;
ed the doctor, "to expetisnce tender emotions about here,"&#xD;
he continued% putting his hand on his waistcoat1 and speak-&#xD;
ing in a 'sarcastic tone ~ hich indicated great contempt for&#xD;
what he called tenderr emotions." "You must sigh all day,&#xD;
and dream of women all iight, before you would venture on&#xD;
matrimo4 You could tiot think of marriage unless you&#xD;
first lost what common sense you have got-oh, no, not you !"&#xD;
LYrayton' often toleratec expressionss of contempt in his Un-&#xD;
cle, whi~h1 proceeding frm any other one, he would have&#xD;
retorted with added bitterness. In the present instance, he&#xD;
could scarcely resist the impulse to .return his ridicule, for&#xD;
he felt it keenly. With a strong and Well-disciplined con-&#xD;
trol, he kept down his feelingg of resentment; and although&#xD;
his cheek glowed, he looked as if he were enjoying the in-&#xD;
terview, and said,&#xD;
"I should certainly w~*it to experience a' feW sighs and&#xD;
tender emotions before I told a lady IL loved her; for many&#xD;
people think-even Shak3peaa~.e hinis~lfthought-~--that love&#xD;
is niad~ of such things."&#xD;
"Fall in love with the estate, that's all you've got to do,"&#xD;
said the doctor, again tapping his snuff-box;&#xD;
"I do love it," returned Prayton, beginning to be amused&#xD;
at the old gentleman's pertinacity. ~' It is a most beautiful&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.                     iOl&#xD;
estate, with its groves and green meadows-its shady forests&#xD;
and murmuring streams~.-and I have too much taste for what&#xD;
is beautiful in this world not to k ye such things."&#xD;
"Then what's the, reason you don't pursue the only pos-&#xD;
sible way to obtain it ?" said the doctor, fiercely. " Go and&#xD;
see Miss IMieredith once or twice' more.~.-make yourself as&#xD;
agreeable as you can.-propose for her hand, and then you'll&#xD;
have the felicity of owning the sha ly groves and murmuring&#xD;
streams you speak of," concluded ~he doctor, 'trying to irni-&#xD;
tate his nephew's voice.&#xD;
"I am not so certain of that 'esult, my dear uncle. I&#xD;
must deliberate about it, however That same lady's hand&#xD;
is not the easiest one in the world to win."&#xD;
"Spoken like a Drayton, by J')ve !" shouted the doctor.&#xD;
"I never knew one of the name ihat wouldn't hesitate un-&#xD;
til all chance of success was gone. I'll swear, I wouldn't&#xD;
have one drop of such dull blood ut my veins for half a king-&#xD;
dom. If there was such a drop about my heart, I would&#xD;
leech my.~elf until it was out of m~ system. I would about&#xD;
as lief have so much vile IDemoer itic blood in my veins.&#xD;
"I must be in a bad way," sak Drayton, rising, "for, un-&#xD;
fortunately, I have some of both k~nds in my veins, and they&#xD;
blend together most harmoniously."'&#xD;
"What.!" vociferated the doctor, in a shrill voice; "you&#xD;
don't ~mean to say that you are a Democrat ?"&#xD;
"I do, sir,"' replied the nephew; "in my political opin-&#xD;
ions I am utterly and hopelessly 1)emocratic."&#xD;
"I will tell you what you are," shouted the doctor, as&#xD;
Drayton was leaving the room; "I will tell you what you&#xD;
are, sir," he continued repeating 'he words, his cheeks red.&#xD;
and his lips tremulous with wrath: "you are a fool !"&#xD;
This was all that Drayton heard ~as he hurried out of the&#xD;
house, fearing his uncle might heai him laughing. He pass-&#xD;
ed along toward his office, thinkii .g of the old gentleman's&#xD;
wrath, and holy abhorrence of Den~cracy and Drayton blood.&#xD;
The doctor was as irascible as a hornet, and when ~once&#xD;
roused, his passions heaved and tossed a long while before&#xD;
they subsided and became calm. The more he thought of&#xD;
Drayton"swrong~headedness, the mcre' unpardonable he deem-&#xD;
ed it, and the more he raved. Hal ~ an hour after his nephew&#xD;
left him, he might have been seer sitting in his chair hold-&#xD;
ing a glass of liquor in one hand, while the other was en-&#xD;
gaged in transferring the beverage to his mouth in a spoon.&#xD;
There he sat, and sipped, and caused. In its passage from&#xD;

the glass to its place of destination, so tremulous was his&#xD;
hand that many drops fell on the red bandana that he had&#xD;
prudently ~spread out on his lap. Occasionally he stopped&#xD;
sipping, and then he would disburden his heart of the pas-&#xD;
sion he felt, and emit low, gruff, indistinct sounds, that bore&#xD;
some remote resemblance to the rumblings of a small vol-&#xD;
cano. It was a habit of the doctor's to have recourse to&#xD;
such 6idiviating influences in all cases of irritation, and, con-&#xD;
sidetixig the frequency of such spells, it is not surprising that&#xD;
his face bloomed like a rose, and that his dexter foot stood&#xD;
in need of a velvet cushion. He was decidedly of the opin-&#xD;
ion that the raging of the passions were best treated when&#xD;
the sentence passed on witchcraft in the olden time was in-'&#xD;
flicted on them-.with this slight difference, however, that&#xD;
a very considerable portion of brandy should be mingled with&#xD;
the water when the passions were to be drowned. He sipped&#xD;
and sipped until the influence of the drowsy god was on him,&#xD;
and then slept soundly, and woke as calm as a sunbeam.&#xD;
lOrayton met George Meredith, who accompanied him to&#xD;
his office. They sat down, and Drayton said,&#xD;
"X hope you suffered no inconvenience after your dissipa-&#xD;
tion at Mrs. Willoughby's the other night ?"&#xD;
"No; my health is much better than it has been for a&#xD;
year. I am delighted that I feel so little weariness from&#xD;
my long ramble over this town this morning. Three months&#xD;
~go as much exertion would have overcome ~&#xD;
"Perhaps love has strengthened your energies; and if so,&#xD;
I sincerely hope it may entirely restore you to health."&#xD;
"Alas! I have no hope of any permanent health," said&#xD;
George, sadly. "Three months since I would have wel-&#xD;
comed the stern conqueror of mankind; but now, when I&#xD;
have other prospects in life, I shudder at the thought of for-&#xD;
saking them, It is a sad thing to die in youth, when every&#xD;
thing is flowery in the path before you. But I have a root-&#xD;
ed conviction that the seeds of dissolution are maturing with-&#xD;
in me; and Iwould much rather walk on in the light of such&#xD;
a conviction to my grave, than to stumble along blindly, in&#xD;
the shadow of unconsciousness, into it."&#xD;
"I wish, my dear friend," said Drayton, very earnestly&#xD;
laying his hand on George's, "that you would turn your eye&#xD;
aside from the gloom with whick it is so familiar, and suffer&#xD;
*your hopes to brighten themselves in the happiness that sur-&#xD;
rou~ids you. It is wrong.-..-it is very wrong," he continued,&#xD;
still more earnestly, "to bow your head to sadness when the&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.           103&#xD;
&#xD;
glad stars are bright above you-to dwell on the cypress in-&#xD;
stead of the rainbow-to woo the night when day invites&#xD;
you to pleasuree"&#xD;
George grasped his hand, and pressed it warmly as he&#xD;
spoke, and as a melancholy smile passed over his sad feat-&#xD;
ures, he returned,&#xD;
"The instinct which teaches the swallow to prepare for a&#xD;
coming storm when the sky is unclouded, is not truer than&#xD;
the conviction which bids me prepare for death. I ~m not&#xD;
gloomy; I am not unable to enjoy pleasure; I am not, de-&#xD;
pressed by this conviction, and therefore it is not wrong in&#xD;
me to maintain it. But," he added, in a~ lighter tone, "I&#xD;
may live many years yet, although I do not anticipate a.&#xD;
lengthening out of the chain of life."&#xD;
"When did you see Miss Randolph ?" inquired Drayton,&#xD;
anxious to divert his friend's mind from the rayless gloom in&#xD;
which he thought he indulged too much.&#xD;
"I saw her as I rode along this morning. By-the-way,&#xD;
sir, if you would like to get acquainted with her, ride' out to&#xD;
Oakwood to-morrow. She has promised to spend that day&#xD;
with my sister. She and Ellen ar~ old friends, and they&#xD;
have for years been in the habit of staying with each other&#xD;
days at a visit. Will you come&#xD;
"I will certainly be there," returned Drayton. "for I&#xD;
have a strong desire to know the fair lady of whose fascina-&#xD;
tions y~u have given me so glowing an account. She is very&#xD;
beautiful, and her pure brow and lustrous eye indicate the&#xD;
power to think and to feel deeply. I have seen her but&#xD;
once, and yet her image is vividly impressed on my memory."&#xD;
"It is inscrutable to me," said George, "that she should&#xD;
k~ve s~~ich a wreck as I am. She loves in the very teeth of&#xD;
hope, for I do not think that she regards the restoration of&#xD;
my health as a probability. The feeling that prompts her&#xD;
to care for me must be widely different' from the earthly&#xD;
passion that people call love. A pure-hearted woman is a&#xD;
most holy being. With her unshrinking firmness in times&#xD;
of trial-with' that unappalled fortitude which bends not to&#xD;
the blast-with her uncontrollable devotion, that follows 'its&#xD;
object through all the vicissitudes of life, itself unchanged&#xD;
in the midst of changes-with such noble endowments, she&#xD;
seems to me as pure as the angels who breathe the atmos-&#xD;
phere of a better world."&#xD;
"And yet," said Drayton, witl~ an eye flashing with in-&#xD;
dignation, "there are miscreants whose poisonous tongues&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
utter slander against such beings -wretches who would&#xD;
smile at your simplicity if they heard you speak of skinless&#xD;
women. When I remember my own dear mother's deep and&#xD;
abiding devotion to me-when I remember ~the prayers her&#xD;
sainted heart breathed to Heaven for my welfare, I feel like&#xD;
striking the guilty wretch to earth whose lips blaspheme&#xD;
the loveliness of woman. There are many light-hearted&#xD;
ladies whose thoughts seem worldly in the crowd, who in&#xD;
the ~nctuaries of their own souls commune with spiritual&#xD;
vi0itants as undellled as the Egeria that delighted the im-&#xD;
agination of the great Roman legislator."&#xD;
'~' Some persons judge of the whole sex from a few corrupt&#xD;
specimens they happen to know," said George. "I thank&#xD;
Heaven that my experience has been among those who are&#xD;
as free from all affectation and. defilement as a meridian sun-&#xD;
beam is from the duskiness of night, and without the com-&#xD;
panionship of such I should not desire to see the light of&#xD;
another. year.&#xD;
"I never knew a man who boasted of his knowledge of&#xD;
the world," said Drayton, "in whom I would repose the&#xD;
least confidence. Such beings have practiced only the vices,&#xD;
and know no more of the virtues of woman and' the noble-&#xD;
ness ~of man than if they had walked blindfold through life.&#xD;
These degraded creatures may be easily recognized among&#xD;
thousands by their manner. They shrug their shoulders,&#xD;
shake their heads, insinuate what, they dare not speak plain-&#xD;
ly, stare and look compassionately at a better person, who,&#xD;
having studied human nature in t~ie light of day, believes&#xD;
in, the holiness of love and the unselfishness of a noble spirit&#xD;
that sighs at every sorrow which afflicts humanity."&#xD;
When George left him, Drayton called on Miss Willoughby,&#xD;
*       whom he had not seen since the party. He found that ami-&#xD;
able young lady dispensing her smiles lavishly to three or&#xD;
four 1~inely-dresse4 young men, whose faces were radiant&#xD;
with joy. To IDrayton she was particularly .gracious; and,&#xD;
had he not suspected her sincerity, he would not only have&#xD;
been delighted with her efforts to advance his happiness, but&#xD;
would have admired her also. Mr-s. Willoughby came in,&#xD;
and seemed extremely anxious that he should understand&#xD;
how much they were pleased by the acquisition of so agree...&#xD;
able an acquaintance as himself. There were some symp-&#xD;
toms of an intrinsically vulgar nature about her Which he&#xD;
by no means relished, from which her pretty daughter, how.&#xD;
ever, was entirely exempt. Themother had all that elabo-&#xD;

rate aping of style which denote 3 the ill-bred, while the&#xD;
young lady's easy, off-hand mann ~r would have passed for&#xD;
gentility any where. He left thcm with a promise to be&#xD;
very sociable, which seemed to give them much unalloyed&#xD;
pleasure.&#xD;
CHAPTER ).YIII.&#xD;
ON the ensuing day, Drayton, according to agreement, rode&#xD;
out to Oakwood. He found Miss Randolph there, and was&#xD;
much pleased with her. He was very favorably impressed&#xD;
by her sprightly and intelligent conversation and affable&#xD;
manner, and thought George's estimate of her loveliness by&#xD;
no means exaggerated. After dinner, he went with Colonel&#xD;
Meredith to see Mr. Fleetwpod.&#xD;
The colonel Pmnd in Di~ayton an agreeable companion,&#xD;
and with him had frequently talked about the distinguished.&#xD;
men of the past and present time. As they walked along,&#xD;
their conversation turned on orators and eloquence.&#xD;
"There is no power in this country like eloquence," re-&#xD;
marked the colonel. "An orator is sure to be a favorite.&#xD;
His is a dazzling and dangerous gift, and his office is one,&#xD;
of great responsibility. Our people are fond of speaking, and&#xD;
a talent of that kind is more admired than any other. It is&#xD;
a sure passport to popular favor. ?he commonest mind feels&#xD;
the charm of an eloquent lip, but ~t rarely troubles itself to&#xD;
understand the excellence of the pcet, which, being more ab-&#xD;
stract and refined, is less intelligible. The orator becomes&#xD;
rich in the same community in which a poet or painter&#xD;
starves.~~&#xD;
"The undue exaltation of one sp ~cies of intellect is always&#xD;
followed by the depreciation of otier kinds of talent," said&#xD;
iDrayton, thoughtfully. "The po'~t and -philosopher sufThr&#xD;
from the over-estimate of the ora tor, as is the case in this&#xD;
country at the present time. Ths showy speaker is more&#xD;
admired than the philosophical writer, and, the flashing mind&#xD;
is preferred.to the profound; and we thus outrage all the es-&#xD;
timates of antecedent times."&#xD;
"True," returned the colonel, "and that is the reason&#xD;
why the tongue of: such a man as Wisher Ames, a, most brill-&#xD;

&#xD;
jant and noble orator, it is true, is more admired than. the&#xD;
pen of Franklin, from which so much wisdom flowed. If&#xD;
such men as Locke' and Milton. were among us, they would&#xD;
be neglected by the many, who lavish all their honors on&#xD;
Henry and Hamilton. If you will take a speech which has&#xD;
been pronounced by some great orator, and compare it with&#xD;
a written essay from the pen of some unknown writer, you&#xD;
will frequently find that the pen of the obscure man has pro..&#xD;
duced a greater amount of vigorous and noble thought than&#xD;
thee lip of' the orator. This proves, what is so universally&#xD;
true, that men are not ranked according to the degrees of&#xD;
intellectual power they possess, so much as they are esti-&#xD;
mated 'by a certain vague and indefinable magic they exert&#xD;
over others.'~&#xD;
"And thus it happens," added Drayton, "that the dema..&#xD;
goguc h~s more admirers than the philosopher. There is&#xD;
no country under heaven in which eloquence is in such, de-&#xD;
mand, and this is the reason why we have more orators than&#xD;
writers. The moment you create a desire for any particular&#xD;
otder of. minds, they are sure to come fbrth. Here the de-&#xD;
sire for orators exists, and every one who fancies he can suc-&#xD;
ceed makes choice of the rostrum, because the good people&#xD;
shower their plaudits on such heads as are eminent in such&#xD;
situations. Besides,~ there is every thing here to inspire such&#xD;
men. Our country is rich in her glorious reminiscences, and&#xD;
our form of government being popular, the people take a&#xD;
n~iost hearty 'interest in its administration, and always go in&#xD;
crowds to listen to an eloquent exposition of the merits of&#xD;
measures which have been proposed or adopted. What do&#xD;
you think the trtie definition of eloquence to be, colonel ?"&#xD;
* "Eloquence, like genius, can be felt, but not defined,"&#xD;
returned the colonel. "It wears as many forms ~s Proteus&#xD;
himself did. It is unlike, in every thing- but its influences,&#xD;
in the Indian and the senator, the natural and the cultivated&#xD;
orator. 1t does not consist in language, for two men may&#xD;
use .the eame words with entirely different effects. It does&#xD;
riot depend on manner, for I have seen graceful and culti-&#xD;
vated speakers who roused rio passion,.,and rough and awk-&#xD;
ward men who seemed t'o have dominion over every senti-&#xD;
ment of the heart. You may go and listen to an oration,&#xD;
and it may rouse every passion of your soul, and wihen you&#xD;
go away you can grow eloquent, in describing its effect, but&#xD;
you can not tell how it was prodriced. It is soul responding&#xD;
to soul, heart to heart. When Patrick Henry electrified that&#xD;

t&#xD;

grave assemblage of dignified patriots at Carpenters' Hall&#xD;
*by eloquence of amazing splendor, riot one of those sages&#xD;
could have told why they were wrought on by the orator as&#xD;
they were. They saw the lightning hurst from the cloud,&#xD;
and. were dazzled and bewildered by it; but when the storm&#xD;
had subsided, not one could give anintelligible account of it,&#xD;
for while it lasted all were blinded by its intense brilliance,&#xD;
and when it was over it was too late to analyze it."&#xD;
On their way they passed by the house in which Mary&#xD;
Winters lived, and saw Hampton talking very earnestly with&#xD;
her. Drayton thought of what Roger had said respecting&#xD;
his visits, and fancied, from his confusion as they came up,&#xD;
that his intentions could not be honorable. Hampton asked&#xD;
Colonel Meredith if Ellen was at home, and saying that he&#xD;
would go and see her, left them. The colonel and Drayton&#xD;
stood and talked with Mary and her mother for a few min-&#xD;
utes, and then resumed their walk. It was not long before&#xD;
they reached the residence of Mr. Fleetwood.&#xD;
The old man was lying down- when they entered, and&#xD;
seemed to be in a particularly unsocial and misanthropic&#xD;
mood. His humor soon changed, and he conversed freely.&#xD;
his room was comfortably furnished. A negro man, in the&#xD;
capacity of a servant, was his only companion, and to him&#xD;
he rarely said much. Drayton looked about the room, and&#xD;
observed several books and two or three musical instruments,&#xD;
from which he inferred that the recluse was a lover of read-&#xD;
ing and music.&#xD;
"Do you never feel a desire to mingle in society ?" in-&#xD;
quired Drayton, anxious to fin4 out how the solitary man&#xD;
amused himself.&#xD;
" I have neve~ seen any thing so mighty lovable in it that&#xD;
I should sigh for it," replied, the old man, sternly, as if he did&#xD;
not like such questions.&#xD;
"But, as man is a social' being by nature, he is willing to&#xD;
suffer many annoyances in society rather than forego his love&#xD;
for its pleasures and conveniences," said Drayton.&#xD;
"If society were natural, then a man might wish to be in it,"&#xD;
returned Mr. Fleetwood, relaxing his sternness a little; " but&#xD;
I hate the base and artificial modes of living in these days."&#xD;
"There a many whose hearts are undegraded by the de-&#xD;
generacy of the tiriies, and with such it is delightful to com-&#xD;
mune," continued Drayton, with a pertinacity which the old&#xD;
man did not appear to relish.&#xD;
"'~'ou talk nonsense~.....Arou'know nothing about it," returned&#xD;

&#xD;
Fleetwoed, very har~shly. lie was bigoted, as your se-&#xD;
eluded men alW~ys are.? One mind requires the action of&#xD;
Qthers on it to prevent its contraction within narrow and&#xD;
selfish limits. The bigot in religion does not acquaint him-&#xD;
self with tenets which difl~r from his own; and the bigots&#xD;
out of religion, b.V corning the opinions that militate against&#xD;
their own cIwrishe4 notions, are even more malignant and&#xD;
tyrannical than their religious brethren.&#xD;
"If a man has t~n friends," continued the old gentleman,&#xD;
slowly, "he will, by. associating with them, be compelled to&#xD;
meet fifty persons whom he despises, and that produces more&#xD;
disrelish than the ten compensate him for. Here I am an&#xD;
independent man. I am cool in summer and warm in win-&#xD;
ter, and free from the malice of the many, and the de-&#xD;
ceitfu1nes~ of all. The occupant of a palace can do no more&#xD;
f~r his body and mind than I do, comfort for the one and&#xD;
content for the other being all that man can attain to, Gome&#xD;
her~e, Trip)" he continued, calling up his dog, and patting his&#xD;
head affectionately. "Here, sir, is a firmer friend thjin you&#xD;
pan find in a whole city."&#xD;
While the old gentleman was fondling his dog, and look-&#xD;
ing well satisfied, for he fancied his argument against society&#xD;
jinanswerable, Drayton said,&#xD;
"Many of the wisest men who have given their opinions&#xD;
on this subjectt to the world differ from you."&#xD;
"They were fools, and knew nothing about the comforts&#xD;
that a man like myself enjoys. I see you get your notions&#xD;
from books, young man. You ought to read them as I do,&#xD;
not to adopt their opinions, but to learn wisdom from their&#xD;
p.bsurdities. The man who has too much book-knowledge is&#xD;
p~pt to grow t~ be like a parrot, and he is, at best, like a man&#xD;
who has to6iaach whisky in his head, and can't see things&#xD;
as they are about him. Your philosophers are fools in com-&#xD;
mon matters, and your only' men of sense are they who do&#xD;
their own thinking."&#xD;
"Well, I can not imagine how a man can be comfortable&#xD;
where the tones of woman's voice are never heard," said&#xD;
Prayton.&#xD;
"'Maybe there are a good many things you can't imagine,&#xD;
~eeing Srou ar~ not quite omniscient yet,'.' returned Mr. Fleet-&#xD;
wood; growing restless. "I get along better 'without women&#xD;
than most of my neighbors do with them."&#xD;
"Sup~0se you should fall sick, then the presence of a&#xD;

"I could but die, and there would be an end to the mat-&#xD;
ter; for my life will have an end, even if your curiosity will&#xD;
not."&#xD;
Seeing that his inquisitiveness was so very disagreeable,&#xD;
iDrayton repressed all further curiosity, and contented him-&#xD;
self' by observing the old gentleman's deep wriukle~ vener-&#xD;
able beard, and harsh features. The colonel held a I~olloquy&#xD;
on business with him, and, that beiag concluded, they rose :to&#xD;
depart, Mr. Fleetwood accompanied them a short distance,&#xD;
and when about leaving them, he turned to iDrayton and&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"I'd like to see you, young man, again, if you'll promise&#xD;
not to ask me niore than a thousand questions next time.&#xD;
You put me in mind of your grandfather, and ~pf the only&#xD;
really pleasant hours I ever knew."&#xD;
"Well, sir, I will come," returned Drayton, smiling, "and&#xD;
be careful to render myself less disagreeable next time."&#xD;
Mr. Fleetwood, with Trip trotting alongside, retu~ed to&#xD;
his solitary abode; and the colonel and Drayton passed on to&#xD;
the bank of the river, intending to follow it until they reached&#xD;
Oakwood.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
WHEN Hampton parted from Colonel Meredith and Dray-&#xD;
ton at Mrs. Winters's, he walked leisurely across the fields&#xD;
toward the colonel's residence, revolving in his mind many&#xD;
projects he was cherishing. Before reaching the house, he&#xD;
met George with the ladies. He joined them, attaching&#xD;
himself to Ellen, who said she wished to take a walk up the&#xD;
river bank.&#xD;
George remained behind with Miss Randolph, occupying&#xD;
a seat, already referred to, on the green bank of the beauti-&#xD;
ful river. The sun was near the horizon, and thiew his&#xD;
slant beams along the waveless bosom of the stream, which&#xD;
glowed like a sheet of burnished gold. Two or three boats,&#xD;
containing fishermen, were lying at anchor near the island,&#xD;
and a few river craft were making slow progress, with their&#xD;
flags drooping listlessly along their flag-staffs.&#xD;
The western heaven was gorgeous.~ Light, feathery clouds&#xD;

were reposing lazily over head, growing denser as they ap.&#xD;
preached the horizon. Caroline had been gazing at the&#xD;
heavens for some time, when she said,&#xD;
"How beautiful! This sky would be noticed if it hung&#xD;
over an Italian scene. Indeed, I never saw a more glorious&#xD;
sunset even in that famed clime. I do not think a love? of&#xD;
the beautiful in nature need travel beyond the shores of our&#xD;
own country, for, surely, 'it~ combines as much of the grand&#xD;
and the beautiful as any other land."&#xD;
"There are some persons, Caroline, who think there is no&#xD;
beauty in heaven or earth in regions with which they are&#xD;
familiar, and such must go abroad to gratify an affected ad-&#xD;
miration of beautiful scenery. These persons are destitute&#xD;
of taste and mental strength; for, when foreigners come&#xD;
among us, they are delighted, and clap their hands in the&#xD;
presence of a scene like this, at the same time protesting&#xD;
that ours is a clime of pre-eminent loveliness."&#xD;
"I made a foppish American my enemy for life while in&#xD;
Italy," said Caroline. "We were a few miles out of Na-&#xD;
ples, and he became wild with rapture as he looked on the&#xD;
landscape, and vowed such a sight was sufficient induce-&#xD;
ment to a voyage across the Atlantic. I told him I had&#xD;
seen hundreds more lovely, and promised him, if he visited&#xD;
me in my home, to show him a more beautiful prospect than&#xD;
Italy contained. I. added, he was not a good American, or&#xD;
he would not disparage his native land, by any such com-&#xD;
pari~on~ as he was fond of making. He pronounced my&#xD;
taste vulgar because it was patriotic. Wherever I happened&#xD;
to be, I held up the vast superiority of my own country, and&#xD;
I had the honor to be called the Democratic lady for my de-&#xD;
votion to my native land. How I wish that you were as&#xD;
good a Democrat as I am."&#xD;
"Such a change in my politics," returned George, "is&#xD;
not to be contemplated, for I am strongly attached to the&#xD;
principle&amp;amp;of the, Federalists. But if any thing could repub-&#xD;
lieanize me, it would be your eloquence, for there is no per-&#xD;
suasion and logic so forcible a~ the tones of the lip we&#xD;
love. -&#xD;
"I wish thatf lip could persuade you to leave the Feder-&#xD;
alists, and to 11i~come as good ,a Democrat as my father is.&#xD;
By-the-way, your friend, Mr~ Drayton, is a Democrat."&#xD;
"Oh yes, and a very zealous one too. Now he would&#xD;
suit you exactly, for he is very aspiring, and I should not&#xD;
wonder if he were to represent this district in Congress in a&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.                     111&#xD;
fe~y years. I am altogether too poetical and literary in my&#xD;
aspirations to enter the political arena."&#xD;
"Mr. ilampton gave me a scolding the other day for talk-&#xD;
ing on political subjects," said Caroline. "He thinks that&#xD;
ladies ought to confine their thoughts to parties, puddings,&#xD;
and pickles, and other* like improving subjects. I wonder&#xD;
what such persons think women were endowed with mind&#xD;
for ?"&#xD;
"There are many who think with Mr. Hampton, but I&#xD;
have always thought that a lady could not be too intelli~&#xD;
gent. Sihe should know something of every subject. That&#xD;
she must talk about something is certain, and if she is in-&#xD;
telligent on no topics but domestic ones, her conversation will&#xD;
be of such things. My taste inclines me to jrcfer politics&#xD;
from pretty lips to the most interesting recipes ever invent-&#xD;
ed for the improvement of pies and puddings, though I can&#xD;
soon get a surfeit of either."&#xD;
"I think there are ladies enough who have just the amount&#xD;
of ignorance to please the tastes of these amiable gentle-&#xD;
men," said Caroline. "I can not help suspecting such per-&#xD;
sons of having tyrannical dispositions; and I fear they are&#xD;
silly enough to wish that the right which ladies possess in&#xD;
common with themselves, to think and to talk as they please,&#xD;
could be shackled. For my part; so long as my tongue is&#xD;
not worn out-and that is a calamity some of my friends&#xD;
predict for it some of these days-just so long will I talk of&#xD;
what concerns me most, whether it is politics or pickles."&#xD;
"I commend that resolution," said George. "A lady&#xD;
never speaks improperly when she converses on subjects&#xD;
which do not display her ignorance, and I am not afraid of&#xD;
your comlnitting such impropriety."&#xD;
"I am very ambitious, as Ellen is, you know; and I think&#xD;
every lady should resemble her too; and then, if they have,&#xD;
as much influence over their husbands a~ people say they&#xD;
have, their husbands would be more worthy of their love, for&#xD;
they would cultivate their minds more than they do. A la-&#xD;
dy's ambition should be for her husband's success, and she&#xD;
should continually stimulate him to exertion. I will make&#xD;
a very great man of you some of these days yet, sir, or worry&#xD;
your life out of you.'~&#xD;
As she concluded she smiled, and looked archly at her&#xD;
companion, who said&#xD;
"I would do any thing for you. For you I would seek&#xD;
the lists of fame, and, like a knight of former days, win the&#xD;

prize, if possible, that I might enjoy praise, sweet and glow-&#xD;
ing, from the lip of beauty. I would climb ambition s most&#xD;
slippery heights, because your heart' would share my tri-&#xD;
umph. I will woo the muses to my study, and wander by&#xD;
the side of Helicon until my looks are heavy with its mists.&#xD;
For you my thoughts shall travel beyond the stars, and be-&#xD;
come acquainted with Nature in all her aspects. The songs&#xD;
of birds-the flowers of spring-the moaning winds of au-&#xD;
tumn-the lone mountain clifI~, where the scream of the&#xD;
eagle is heard-the wild ocean, when the spirits of the storm&#xD;
arewhitening its billows with foam-.--.shall for you, by turns,&#xD;
win my fancy and gild my song. I will become profound&#xD;
in the knowledge of the past-I will study society-I will&#xD;
question my own heart-I will commune with the living&#xD;
and ~the dead-I will call the master minds of all ages to&#xD;
my aid-I will invoke the spirits of the earth and the air,&#xD;
an4 summon up the mysterious power that rules the lone,&#xD;
&amp;amp;eep hour of midnight to assist me, if by such means I can&#xD;
render myself more worthy of your love, and bring the flush&#xD;
of pride to your brow, and win the honeyed tones of appro-&#xD;
bation from your lips."&#xD;
As he spoke his eye brightened, his cheek flushed, his lip&#xD;
quivered with enthusiasm. Caroline watched the changing&#xD;
expressions that flitted over his features, and drank in his&#xD;
fervent tones With, intense interest. As she glanced at his&#xD;
vivid eye, she fancied she could discover in its depths some-&#xD;
thing of the rapt power of genius, and almost adored it.&#xD;
"And would you act thus for my sake ?" she inquired,&#xD;
earnestly, looking full in his face, and placing her soft hand&#xD;
gently on his.&#xD;
"Oh yes," he replied, grasping her proffered hand.&#xD;
"Any eminence within the reach of my abilities shall be&#xD;
mine, if you desire it. Y~u have but to wish it, and I will&#xD;
ascend to heights known but to the eagle, if the eagle's&#xD;
power is mine."&#xD;
"It is enough-.-.I am satisfied."&#xD;
The next minute she discovered that a change had passed&#xD;
over her lover's features. Gone was the bright glance of his&#xD;
eye, and vanished was the enthusiasm that flashed on his&#xD;
noble brow like the reflection of the frolic lightning on the&#xD;
evening cloud. Sadness, like a sable shadow, was on his&#xD;
pale face, and a tear glistened in his radiant eye.&#xD;
"Oh! why do you look thus ?" she exclaimed, with a wild&#xD;
expression of surprise.&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTO~.&#xD;
&#xD;
113&#xD;
&#xD;
For a moment he said nothing, for his, heart 'was too full;&#xD;
and there she sat, gazing wildly up on his face, as if she were&#xD;
reading every secret shrouded in the depths of his spirit. His&#xD;
head declined for an instant, and then, raising his eye, he&#xD;
tried to look cheerful as he said;&#xD;
"Alas! what creatures of the moment we are! The&#xD;
breath of the tempest passes over the bright surface ofthe&#xD;
river, and its tranquillity is gone; and the lightning touches&#xD;
the pride of the forest, and in an instant its lofty head comes&#xD;
crashing to the earth; and with equal suddenness an unex-&#xD;
pected thought will frequently dash the cup of hope from the&#xD;
lip, red with pleasure, when we least look for it'. One glance&#xD;
at yonder walls," he continued, pointing toward the family&#xD;
cemetery, "chilled the enthusiasm and froze the hopes that&#xD;
a moment before swelled 'my heart and winged the thoughts&#xD;
I felt. A voice from the tomb paralyzed my feelings, and&#xD;
whispered to my spirit that the grave, and not the triumphs&#xD;
of Worldly ambition, should be its doom."&#xD;
"My dear George !" was the only exclamation that es-&#xD;
caped her lips before her head drooped, and ~he wept. Her&#xD;
sobbings soon became audible to ~George, whose feelings for&#xD;
a while ~suppressed the worc1~ of encourageirrent he would&#xD;
have uttered.&#xD;
"My dear Caroline," he said, when he regained sufficient&#xD;
composure, 'show foolish we are! It waA but a fancy," he&#xD;
continued, with a melancholy smile and a subdued tone;&#xD;
"and yet our too credulous hearts received it as if it were&#xD;
truly a voice from the sunless land. Lift up your head, and&#xD;
see how the gloom has passed away from my features, and&#xD;
I',&#xD;
know that my heart is again beating high with hope.&#xD;
She brushed the tears from her' eyes, and ~slowly raised&#xD;
her head, and when her 'look encountered her lover's, she&#xD;
perceived no sadness there.&#xD;
"It was cruel, it was worse than cruel" he said, as he&#xD;
placed his arm about her waist and drew her nearer, "to&#xD;
torture you with my idle and superstitious fai~cies. *Look up&#xD;
yonder! Look up at those crimson clouds! How resplen-&#xD;
dently they glow in the beams of the setting sun! How&#xD;
serene is the bosom of the riyer, and: how exquisite is the&#xD;
song of that bird, gushing up from its grateful heart an an-&#xD;
them to the IDeity~before it seeks' the sheltering bough for&#xD;
the night. Oh! at such~ an 'hour the heart should be un.&#xD;
troubled,. and the brow 'as, tranquil as the deep blue sky&#xD;

&#xD;
Caroline, with the quick and searching penetration of her&#xD;
sex, perceived his object was to divert her thoughts from sor-&#xD;
row, and responding thereto, said,&#xD;
"The sky is grand! And do you observe those light&#xD;
orange clouds, floating like gossamer boats with their spirit-&#xD;
crews on the azure sea&#xD;
"And ~now lower your eyes, and see how the sun falls be-&#xD;
low the crest of the distant mountain! He sinks as Julius&#xD;
Ca~sar sank in the Capitol, enrobed in purple !"&#xD;
In a few minutes they rose and walked toward the house..&#xD;
George looked back through the openings among the trees,&#xD;
in order to see whether Ellen and Hampton were returning,&#xD;
and said,&#xD;
"Ellen must have gone a considerable distance up the&#xD;
bank, for she is not visible."&#xD;
"I think your friend, Mr. Drayton, admires Ellen very&#xD;
much," said Caroline, as they reached the house, "for I dis-&#xD;
covered something in his manner I could not account for on&#xD;
any other supposition. I think he is a gentleman of much&#xD;
nobleness and~ principle."&#xD;
"Undoubtedly he merits your high opinion," returned&#xD;
George. "He is very much depressed, at times, by the ap-&#xD;
prehension that he will not succeed in acquiring fame and&#xD;
fortune in his profession; but I anticipate a high degree of&#xD;
success for him, for I do not believe that industry, joined&#xD;
with merit, ever remained unnoticed and unpatronized for&#xD;
any great length of time; and he has both those qualifica-&#xD;
tions for rising in the world in an eminent degree."&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
ELLEN, aec0mpanled by Hampton, kept the path which&#xD;
wound among the trees growing on the green bank of the&#xD;
river. Her companion was an old and familiar acquaint-&#xD;
ance. She had been informed of many facts in his personal&#xD;
history which she utterly condemned, and at times she hes-&#xD;
itated whether she ought to permit him to continue his in-&#xD;
timacy witit her. flut then the recollections of her early&#xD;
years, many of which were intimately associated with him,&#xD;
would appeal forcibly in his favor, and she concluded it&#xD;
&#xD;
JMI~AYTON.                  115&#xD;
'gould be better that her conduct toward him should con-&#xD;
tinue unchanged.&#xD;
Hampton flattered himself that much of his conduct1 which&#xD;
he felt to be gross and inexcusable in the extreme, was un-&#xD;
known to her, whose purity he well knew Would be shocked&#xD;
if she was informed of it. His inordinate vanity induced&#xD;
him to believe that by long-continued perseverance he could&#xD;
overcome all the objections she had frequently urged against&#xD;
him.; and he fancied that, by deceiving her in regard to his&#xD;
vices, lie might eventually triumph over all obstacles, and&#xD;
secure her affections. For such a hope Ellen had given him&#xD;
no warrant, for she had never shown any more respect for&#xD;
him than the civilities of society required. Still, he con-&#xD;
strued every word; look, and smile of hers, when in his pres-&#xD;
ence, as indications of the most kindly sentiments toward&#xD;
him, and had recently resolved on prosecuting his suit with&#xD;
renewed ardor. For this purpose he visited her very fre-&#xD;
quently; made her sundry trifling presents; exerted every&#xD;
means in his power to win her regard, and had concluded&#xD;
that he might venture to make a profession of love with&#xD;
strong probabilities of success.* That such a mair as Hamp-&#xD;
ton could not feel any sentiment akin to that ennobling love&#xD;
which elevates and purifies the heart, spiritualizes every&#xD;
tho~ight born under the shadow of its power, and burns for&#xD;
a union of spirit and a sympathy of thought with some be-&#xD;
loved object, was as well known to himself as to any one else.&#xD;
What he called love was but a sensual and groveling pas-&#xD;
sion of the earth, blended with that low and mean avarice&#xD;
which regards the pecuniary advantages of a matrimonial&#xD;
connection as a matter of the highest moment. Profligate&#xD;
and abandoned as he was, he yet had the temerity to hope&#xD;
that the unsullied hand of the beautiful and lovely Ellen&#xD;
Meredith might be his; and he was base enough to confess&#xD;
to himself that he regarded his success as desirable chiefly&#xD;
because it would advance his worldly interests, and put ~him&#xD;
in possession of the Oakwood' estate, where he might live&#xD;
luxuriously, unharassed by the necessity of laboring for the&#xD;
means of a subsistence. Hi~ vices had nearly reduced him&#xD;
to bankruptcy, and he felt that the only way by which he&#xD;
could reinstate his fortunes was to marry an heiress. Such&#xD;
was the man, and ~such were the views entertained by him,&#xD;
who dreamed of winning the affections of that gentle heart.&#xD;
whinh looked upon love as an emanation from above, a8bright&#xD;
and as pure as the beam which sparkles in the dew~drop.&#xD;

While she was sauntering along carelessly, and not at all&#xD;
suspecting the thoughts that were agitating his mind, he&#xD;
was meditating. on~ the propriety of' embracing that oppor-&#xD;
tunity to declare his passion in her ear. She rallied him&#xD;
more than once on his moodiness, which he answered with&#xD;
a sigh and an averting of the eye, which was meant for sen..&#xD;
timentality. ~he was more than usually gay and buoyant,&#xD;
and talked on rapidly, without seeming to care whether he&#xD;
heeded what she said or not. Indeed, what he might think&#xD;
was a matter of the most perfect indifference to her, for her&#xD;
heart was full of animation, and she acted and thought very&#xD;
much. as she would have done had she been wandering with-&#xD;
out a companion. Springing aside from the path, she stooped&#xD;
down and, pulled a beautiful wild flower, and, extending it&#xD;
toward her moody admirer, said,&#xD;
There, sir, do you not think that a sweet flower? See&#xD;
how rich its hues gre, and it only needs some fragrance to&#xD;
complete its perfection.&#xD;
He looked carelessly at the simple flower, and then glan-&#xD;
cing at the merry eye of his companion, answered,&#xD;
"It is delightful, decidedly; I wish I had some of your&#xD;
relish for such things. -'But, alas! my feelings, once fresh,&#xD;
are now withered as that flower will be to-morrQw."&#xD;
"Well, now, that is what I call sentimental," she said,&#xD;
laughing at the thought. "Why, sir," she continued, "you&#xD;
have no taste if you do not love flowers, and in that partic-&#xD;
ular you differ from most of the sentimental gentlemen of&#xD;
ray acquaintance. I mean to get up a society of persons of&#xD;
good taste, and the qualification for membership shall be a&#xD;
devoted love of flowers. Take care, sir, or you will not have&#xD;
the honor of being a membeix"&#xD;
"If any thing could induce me to cultivate a taste for such&#xD;
things," he said, with a sigh, "it would be the wish to be-&#xD;
come a'member of your society. But if I were to make the&#xD;
atte~npt, I should certainly fail. My thoughts," he contin-&#xD;
ued, with his eyes fixed on her face, "my thoughts, Miss&#xD;
Meredith, my feelings, are all given, to one subject. 'There is&#xD;
only one thing in life 'that is very dear to me, and, under such&#xD;
circumstances, it would be useless in me to try to acquire&#xD;
tastes which Heaven has denied' me. If you were to plant a&#xD;
rose ~on that old stump, do you suppose it would flourish ?"&#xD;
"Indeed I do not know, ~ ii have never wade any such&#xD;
horticultural, experiments. But stc~~ your prosingand listen&#xD;
to the 'poetry of that bird's song ! ~Don't you think its' strains&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
resemble the inellowest tones of a fife? I hope, sir, you have&#xD;
some ear,' although you have no heart."&#xD;
"Not much ear' either, I fear," returned Hampton, in a&#xD;
tone that was, decidedly unmusical; "and 'I must confess, to&#xD;
be candid, that I have not much love for birds' songs. As&#xD;
a friend of mine said," he added, more gayly, "they are too&#xD;
un-Ltalian for my taste."&#xD;
"T'shaw! sir, your friend has no soul, and I pity him from&#xD;

its exquisite notes again !"&#xD;
"I would rather look at the rose blooming on your' cheek,"&#xD;
said Hampton, glancing at her, while her eye was directed&#xD;
upward to the bird, to whose song she was listening with a&#xD;
rapt expression of delight, "than on all the flowers that ever&#xD;
grew in garden or forest; and I would rather drink in, the&#xD;
ecstatic melody of your voice, than listen to all the birds that&#xD;
ever sang in Eden. Now, my lady fair, confess that I have&#xD;
some 'taste."&#xD;
"When you indicate it, IL will," she replied; and then&#xD;
stepping to the verge of the bank, and glancing at the glo-&#xD;
ries of the western sky, she continued, "I will give you an&#xD;
opportunity of vindicating your tastes from my censure.&#xD;
Look up at that sky, and tell me whether you ever saw any&#xD;
thing more' brilliant and beautiful !"&#xD;
"It is a brilliant scene, but I confess my heresy~ as you,&#xD;
I fear, will think it, when I assure you I had rather gaze&#xD;
on the heaven ef your brow swept by curls instead of clouds,&#xD;
than on that beautiful sky."&#xD;
"You must be daft, sir, as they say in Scotland," was 'all&#xD;
she said to him in return. She thought he was impertinent,&#xD;
and felt very much like telling 'him' so. She was used to&#xD;
that very common and ill-judged species of flattery, and al-&#xD;
ways experienced a feeling of contempt when it was addressed&#xD;
to her in so personal a manner, and wL so unseasonable a&#xD;
moment.&#xD;
They stood f@ some minutes~in' silence on the bank. of the&#xD;
river. Ellen was musing tn the beauties of sky and cloud,&#xD;
without a thought of her companion, while he stood by her&#xD;
side gazing on her radiant and 'beautiful faces A thrill of&#xD;
passion. r~n through his frame, for if he ever felt any thing&#xD;
like love, 'it was at. that'moment; aud b'ur~ing 'language tose&#xD;
to his lips, but he had not 'sufficient courage to speak it just&#xD;
then. They resumed their ~walk in silence. Hampton was&#xD;
the 'first to speak.&#xD;

"Were. you ever in love, Miss Meiedith ?"&#xD;
"Yes1 with all the glad:and beautiful things of this ~carth.&#xD;
By-the-way; sir, you must be sadly slandered, or your expe-&#xD;
rience with that very tender passion must be the most re.~&#xD;
markable ever known to mortal man. II heard, lately,. that&#xD;
both Miss Churchill ~,nd MissOarson had the honor of re-'&#xD;
jecting you in one short evening. Now, I must say, your&#xD;
facility in gettiiig in love and getting out again is the most&#xD;
astonishing thifrg of the sort I ever heard of."&#xD;
"I scorn ~nch reports," said Hampton, while a dark sha:d~w.&#xD;
passed over his swarthy features. "They are foul lies, and'&#xD;
I trust you do not believe them."&#xD;
"I think it quite probable, sir, that your heart, ~hieh you&#xD;
delight in representing as remarkable for capacity and sens-&#xD;
itiveness, may be transfixed by two arrows at the same&#xD;
time."&#xD;
Had she been aware of what this conversation would lead&#xD;
to, she would have checked it at onced He hesitated an in-&#xD;
stant, w~hen; feeling courageous, he sai4,&#xD;
"You mistake rue, Ellen. My heart is as true and Un-&#xD;
swerving as a swan's. Although, in society, gallantry re-&#xD;
quires that I should bow at many shrines, yet I have never&#xD;
offered up my affections at any one. How could I,, when&#xD;
my heart was constant in its devotions to one beautiful and&#xD;
divine objeet-.--to you, Ellen ?"&#xD;
"That is very pretty, but very wild sort of language to&#xD;
come from your tongue, Mr. Hampton. If you say any thing&#xD;
more so silly and so solemn, I will certainly thini you crazy,"&#xD;
she said, wishing to spare his feelings and put an end to his&#xD;
confession.&#xD;
"If I am crazy, Ellen, then love for you has made mew."&#xD;
He' would. have added more, but she looked dubiousfy at&#xD;
him, and. Thughed outright, saying,&#xD;
"I ~nosn. to go right ever to your mother, and advise her&#xD;
by all means to have you sent forthwith to sonic lunatic&#xD;
a~syl~um,' Thr I protest I never heard a gentleman utter the&#xD;
veriest badinage with such a solemn face in my life, and I&#xD;
can. not account for it on any other supposition tha&#xD;
are stark mad."  '~                        n that you&#xD;
"'Here. on my knees" he said, passionately, as he ~dropped&#xD;
on that portion. of his body and seized her hand, "there, I&#xD;
beg you., I implore you, Ellen, to listen to me."&#xD;
Well, now, this is a very interesting scene, as well 'as a&#xD;
very fine piece of acting," said Ellen, laughing, as she con-&#xD;
&#xD;
template the position of her lover., She wash very well.&#xD;
aware that he had uo heart to wound, and therefore treated&#xD;
his seriousness as if it' were the., most farcical thing in the&#xD;
~orId, thinking, that the best way ~f terminating a scene&#xD;
which was extremely~ disa~ee,~blej.'t~b her. For a genuii~e&#xD;
feeling, no Qne entertained more '.res~eci~ or sympathy; but&#xD;
she knew Hampton was utterly destitute of the power of&#xD;
cherishing a, pure passion, and~ added,&#xD;
"You must 'purely be trying to. revive the days of chivalry&#xD;
in this prosaic country, and your effort is very .creditalAe to&#xD;
you. If you would go on th~ stage, I have no doubt of your&#xD;
entire success."&#xD;
While she spoke, his comnion sense suggested to him that&#xD;
he had better rise and laugh at what had passed, but, at&#xD;
the same time, his vanity whis~ered'to him that she was&#xD;
only trying his fidelity, and under that persuasion, and with&#xD;
the hope that perseverance would melt her to kindness, he&#xD;
retained his position, and, with a~fervent tone of voice, con-&#xD;
tinued, -&#xD;
"I love you, Ellen, with a passion which borders on mad-&#xD;
ness, and my happiness, and my. misery are alike in your&#xD;
hands. Oh! Kilen, if.you-"&#xD;
"It is useless to say more, Mr. Hampton,?' she said, inter-&#xD;
rupting him, and assuming a more dignified and distant air.&#xD;
"Y~u act very str~nge1y, sir. Rise, and behave yourself like&#xD;
a. man."&#xD;
While she was speaking her cheek became flushed, and,&#xD;
disengaging her hand from4 his grasp, she fook a few steps&#xD;
from him, as if she intended returning home. He jumped&#xD;
up. and' approached her, and while his face was burning&#xD;
with.shame and passion, exclaimed, in a' loud and passion-&#xD;
ate tone,&#xD;
'  OhA how can, you treat me so coldly-.~--how can you act&#xD;
so.crueliy? I Jove'youKl~lllen, and at this moment feel that&#xD;
death would be preferable to your frown."&#xD;
She turned, and, looking at him with a calm but most res-&#xD;
olute expression of countenance, said,&#xD;
"Mr. Hampton, I will not listen to any more such pro-&#xD;
fessions from you. You ai:riaze me."&#xD;
Hier decided tone infuriated him, and, with the wild and&#xD;
distracted ~ir of one reft of his senses, he said,&#xD;
"rlunge a dagger through my heart, if you please, but do&#xD;
~ot look so coldly on one who is ready to die for your sake,&#xD;

spake, and the curling lip indicated the pride of her nature&#xD;
and the irrepressible scorn she felt. The mortification of&#xD;
her lover was evident as, with a confused look and. falter-&#xD;
ing tone, he said, -&#xD;
"I confess my error, Miss Meredhh. - Will you do me the&#xD;
favor-~--it may be the last one I shall ever ask of you-to&#xD;
keep what has passed between us a profound secret ?"&#xD;
"Ay, I will, sir !" she replied, looking haughtily down on&#xD;
him as her eye flashed Wi1~k indignation. "That request&#xD;
shall be freely granted, I ass~r~ you, sir, for I would. not hum-&#xD;
ble myself so nearly to yox*r town level as to confess that I&#xD;
have listened to professions of love from lips like yours."&#xD;
"To forgive and forget is the province of angels, Miss Mer-&#xD;
edith; may I expect pardon for my folly from you ?"&#xD;
"Yes, on condition that you deport yourself as though you&#xD;
know me not henceforth. I have long wished for an oppor-&#xD;
tunity of discontinuing the familiarity that I have too long&#xD;
sufibred. And now grant me one favor in return, and leave&#xD;
me to my own reflections.~~&#xD;
-As she spoke she discovered the forms of her' father and&#xD;
Drayton coming toward her, and she jumped from the tuee&#xD;
on which she had been standing, and, without saying another&#xD;
word to her lover, ran to meet them. Hampton watched her&#xD;
form asit receded from him for a minute, and then passed'off&#xD;
rapidly in another direction.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
As Ellen proceeded onward, her frame trembled from the&#xD;
excitement of her feelings. - The scene she had just passed&#xD;
through caused her much irritation; and as she thought&#xD;
of Hampton's conduct, pity and contempt for him by turns&#xD;
swayed her feelings. Her strong emotions caused the tears&#xD;
tQ start in her eyes; but, with that control which she was&#xD;
in the habit of exerting over her excited feelings, she sub-&#xD;
dued her emotions, and,' brushing the- tOars 'from hex eyes,&#xD;
ran on - rapidly, like ,a 'gay and happy creatures with a emil-&#xD;

"1 l~ave been running.. liow did you like Mr. Fleetwood,&#xD;
M~ P~yton?" she asked, anxious to divert their attention&#xD;
from herself.&#xD;
~ lie is one of the. mq~t singular men I ever saw," replied&#xD;
n~ "He is certainly very eccentric; and he has some&#xD;
gli and troi~g~points, which I mean to study at xnylei~ure."&#xD;
"What ~a delightful evening this is !" said Ellen, nearly&#xD;
out of breath from her emotions and her strong efforts to sup-&#xD;
press them. "I never heard the birds sing more sweetly."&#xD;
"Perhaps you are, in a peci4frAy fine mood. for enjoying&#xD;
such things," remarked Drayton. "You know how much&#xD;
our delights depend on the condition of our minds. When&#xD;
we are cheerful, we can enjoy what we should dislike if we&#xD;
were moody; and when we are particularly contemplative&#xD;
and poetical,' the songs of birds afford us exquisite pleasure."&#xD;
"True !" said Ellen; "and, speaking of what is poetical,&#xD;
'have you been observing the beauty of the western sky ?"&#xD;
* "Oh~ yes," replied .Drayton, "your father has by far too&#xD;
fine a relish for glorious sunsets to pass such a one as adorned&#xD;
the heavens ihis evening unnoticed. We sat on the bank&#xD;
and looked at it, for a quarter of an hour, and I think it was&#xD;
one of the most magnificent scenes my eyes ever beheld."&#xD;
"I have rim so fast that I am almost exhausted," said&#xD;
Ellen, smiling at the success with which she contrived to&#xD;
conceal her excitement. ~" I left George and Caroline sit-&#xD;
ting on the river's bank while I wandered off. I presume&#xD;
they have grown weary while waiting for me, and returned&#xD;
home."&#xD;
When they reached the house, George asked 0his sister&#xD;
where Mr. Hampton was, and expressed some surpnse at&#xD;
her returning without him.&#xD;
"We had a difference, and I advised him to go home, and&#xD;
he very gallantly obeyed me, thus leaving me to enjoy my.&#xD;
self as well as I could without his society."&#xD;
"You have offended him, sister, and I would not wonder&#xD;
if he were, to wait for some apology from you before he comes&#xD;
:back here."&#xD;
"The probability is, then, he will not honor us very soon,"&#xD;
said Ellen; "and we must do the best we can 'to survive&#xD;
the loss of so very agreeable an associate."&#xD;
Ellen soon introduced another subject, and felt glad she&#xD;
had escape~l the necessity of making some very disagreeable&#xD;
explanations.&#xD;
The evening wore away pleasantly, and, notwithstanding&#xD;
&#xD;
.DRAYTON.&#xD;
Ellen's gayety, Drayton fancied that her thoughts would ~&#xD;
casionally recur tQ some disagreeable subject, for, he observed&#xD;
that she was at times abstracted. She talked brilliantly and&#xD;
sang sweetly, and to the eye of a stranger she would ~&#xD;
seemed one of the ~happiest beings in the world. IJ3ut 'ti~K'~&#xD;
stranger would have misjudged in estimating the lightness.&#xD;
of her heart from the lightuoss of her manner, and his error&#xD;
would by no means have been extraordinary, f&amp;amp;r we fre-&#xD;
quently deck our faces with smiles when our hearts are as&#xD;
bitter as the fruits that grow by the Dead Sea.&#xD;
The pride of man's heart induces him to crush, as with a&#xD;
'heel 'of iron, a disagreeable emotion, while.a sensitive woman&#xD;
has no refuge from such torture but that which she ~finds in&#xD;
her tears. Notwithstanding her buoyancy, 'the image of&#xD;
Hampton was continually present to her during the evening,&#xD;
and when she retired to her chamber, she took a deliberate&#xD;
survey of her conduct in relation to hi.m-commended herself&#xD;
for the course she pursued--scorned as she dwelt' on the re-&#xD;
membraince of his importunate appeals-.-and then wept pro-&#xD;
fusely, and gradually became calm.&#xD;
When Hampton parted from Ellen, he walked off on a&#xD;
rapid pace toward the residence of his mother, while his&#xD;
wounded vanity caused him much exquisite agony. He&#xD;
loathed the thought of his. own humiliation, and cursed his&#xD;
folly. with the earnestness and bitterness of a maniac.' He&#xD;
~writhed as he recalled Ellen's haughty disdain, and muttered&#xD;
~his curses aloud when he thought. of the scorn with which&#xD;
she had rejected the offer of his han&amp;amp; ' His mortification&#xD;
was intense as he fancied how contemptuously she would&#xD;
henceforth look upon him. But, with individuals of his caste,&#xD;
such bitter feelings soon expend their fury, and before he&#xD;
reached the road side he lifted his 'head 'from theground and&#xD;
soliloquized in the following strain, muttering his words quite&#xD;
'audibly as he went along.&#xD;
"What a cursed fool I am! What a pity it is that a fel-&#xD;
'low's common sense don't act until. it's too late. I can see&#xD;
very clearly how I should have acted, now, when the time's&#xD;
gone by; but when I had some use for my sense, it wouldn't&#xD;
come to my assistance. A man is as lAind as a bat before&#xD;
a thing oeeurs, but he can see as clear as an eagle after it's&#xD;
all over. Whew.! just to think of it, how her.- eye flashed&#xD;
its lightning on me! I'll swear, I don't believe any pretty&#xD;
lip ever wore so much scorn at one time before. And how'&#xD;
the pretty creature raved, and talked about my presumption&#xD;

iii thinking I had the power to win a smile from her! By&#xD;
the Evangelists! I'd give half I am worth-but that would&#xD;
only be one coat and one pair of Davis's boots-I'd give a&#xD;
good deal, if I had it, to 12.ave a good portrait of the scornful&#xD;
lady as she stood on the trunk of that old tree, with her&#xD;
arms folded, telling me th t.t she was not a lady to be trifled&#xD;
with. Faith, I believe it aow. Well, that cake's dough, or&#xD;
I'm no judge. Now, you see, Mr. Ned Hampton, you una-&#xD;
dulterated jackass, by your bad management to-day you have&#xD;
lost the deed to the Oak'wood estate. Think of that, and do&#xD;
better next time. I later myself that I've impudence&#xD;
enough to hold my undei-lip up even in her presence yet.&#xD;
By Jove! impudence is 'worth as much as a German prin-&#xD;
cipality to a man.~ I have a magnificent endowment of it,&#xD;
and it shall work out mj salvation yet. These flats and&#xD;
jiltings are what one must expect; but, curse them, they&#xD;
are not among the pleasures of paradise. I am one of a&#xD;
vast number of great men who have gone home muttering&#xD;
and cursing their luck because some freakish beauties saw&#xD;
fit to give them an awful fling heavenward. I think I can&#xD;
come down as softly as any of them. It is the destiny of&#xD;
us great men, ha! ha! h~~! it is the destiny of us great men&#xD;
to be laid on our backs by pretty girls, who can't appreciate&#xD;
our sublime and soaring merits. Let me see, what had I&#xD;
better do now? Shall I go and get gloriously drunk, drown&#xD;
my sorrows in the bowl, after the fashion of the immortal&#xD;
bards, or shall I go and court somebody else? That's a&#xD;
happy thought. 'Off with the old love and on with the&#xD;
new. Sensible man that, who gives such admirable ad-&#xD;
vice. Let's see what I shall do? Ah! I have it. I'll go&#xD;
and finish my visit to Mary. LQok out, Mary Winters, or&#xD;
there '11 he the mischief to pay some of these days. What's&#xD;
that Dick the Third says of the Lady Anne? Something&#xD;
about winning her and not wearing her long, I believe.&#xD;
Hang me, I never had any genius for remembering Shaks-&#xD;
peare. Jf I ever take the fair Ellen's advice and go on the&#xD;
stage, I'll play :Romeo, for that jumps with my genius, and&#xD;
all its amazing peculiarities and sublimities, exactly."&#xD;
Here he reached the road, and turned up toward Mary's&#xD;
home. He toon met her, and, as he saluted her, his face&#xD;
was as free from aU~ slmAows as the most fastidious lady&#xD;
would wish 'to look on.&#xD;
Hampton had frequently expressed a great deal of regard&#xD;
for Mary Winters; and, h&amp;amp;I she been wise, ~he would have&#xD;

suspected the sincerity of his professions and spurned them,&#xD;
instead of viewing them as the confessions of an honest heart.&#xD;
But she, like many others of her sex and condition, was&#xD;
flattered by the attentions of one who was so Luperior, so..&#xD;
cially, to herself, and listened with delight to every word he&#xD;
uttered. Notwithstanding her engagement with Roger, she&#xD;
exerted every means she. possessed to win the affections of&#xD;
Hampton. Indeed, she was anxious to unite her fortunes&#xD;
with one who could boast more refinement than Roger. He&#xD;
was honest, but then he was rough, and the more she re-&#xD;
flected on his want of manner and address, the less inclina-&#xD;
tion she felt to fulfill her engagement with him. When she&#xD;
contrasted his boorishness with Hampton's elegance, she re-&#xD;
coiled from the prospect of marryi:ig one in whom she could&#xD;
feel so little pride. Her situation was perilous; for she was&#xD;
a gay, glad creature of impulse, who rarely troubled herself&#xD;
with reflections on the propriety (f any course that her pas-&#xD;
sions prompted her to pursue, and never doubted the truth&#xD;
of a profession if it was grateful tT. her feelings.&#xD;
On the present occasion she received Hampton with the&#xD;
most undisguised delight, and, as he pressed her hand and&#xD;
told her that he had been with tie ladies at Oakwood, and&#xD;
found that they could not confer half as much happiness on&#xD;
him as she could, she felt flattered, and believed every word&#xD;
he uttered. Her eye was radiart with joy, and her cheek&#xD;
became flushed as the honeyed accents from his lips fell&#xD;
upon her ear and awakened the kindest feelings of her heart.&#xD;
Hampton observed the pleasure he afforded her, and it was&#xD;
not long before he fancied that sh~ was in his power. She,&#xD;
unsuspecting girl, had read in rorfiance, and had known in-&#xD;
stances in real life, in which men o~: superior birth had stooped&#xD;
from aristocratic heights to wed women. of less pretension,&#xD;
and her vanity assured her that Hampton was one of those&#xD;
noble men, and that she would probably be one of those&#xD;
highly favored women. Alas! ii is vanity that holds the&#xD;
treacherous gift of the fabled sireAs, and, lulled by its melo-&#xD;
dious tones, how often are the saving suspicions of the heart&#xD;
quieted, and thus vice afforded ai~ easy triumph!&#xD;
As the night was pleasant, they left the house and wan-&#xD;
dered out beneath the stars. Tk~e serene sky and tranquil&#xD;
earth were in harmony, and the htndscape reposed in the&#xD;
shadow of the wing of night,. without a breath or sound to&#xD;
disturb its holy quiet. Mary olung~ closely to Hampton's arm,&#xD;
and listened to his words with delirious pleasure, and expe-&#xD;

hour and the scene as her heart drank in the subtle poison&#xD;
from the lip of her companion.&#xD;
Mary," he said, in a low and musical tone of voice,&#xD;
"Mary, do you remember when we used to go to school to-&#xD;
gether in the old schoobhouse, over here in the corner of the&#xD;
woods? I was much older than you, but even then I looked&#xD;
on your bright face and long auburn curls, and thought you&#xD;
the loveliest, as you were the fairest, among all the girls.&#xD;
And do you recollect how I used to catch you up in my arms,&#xD;
and kiss your blushing cheek with all the fervency of a&#xD;
young adorer ?"&#xD;
He stopped, and, placing his arm round her waist, looked&#xD;
down, with an eye burning with passion, on the sweet and&#xD;
dreamy face which the fair girl turned up toward him as she&#xD;
answered,&#xD;
"Yes, they were precious days. You were a naughty boy&#xD;
then, and used to kiss us little girls as if you really did love&#xD;
us."&#xD;
"And I did love you then as I do now," whispered Hamp-&#xD;
ton, as he stooped dowu and kissed the lip of the unsuspect-&#xD;
ing girl. "Mary~" he continued, "let us sit down here, and&#xD;
while we are looking at the stars shining in the river's bosom,&#xD;
we will talk of those sweet days."&#xD;
They were seated on the trunk of a fallen tree, and Hamp-&#xD;
ton, again twining his arm about her waist, played his fingers&#xD;
among the tresses that shaded her pure and unspotted brow.&#xD;
And, while thus supporting her willing form, he talked to&#xD;
her of love, and of the happiness which would be hers if she&#xD;
would consent to link her fate with his own wayward fortunes.&#xD;
And she was false to Roger for the sake of one whose Upas-&#xD;
like breath withered the flowers of her innocence, which, up&#xD;
to that hour, bloomed and exhaled their fragrance in the&#xD;
smiles of an onlooking and approving Heaven.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
As the season advanced, George Meredith's friends, fear-&#xD;
ing the effect of the winter on his delicate frame, advised&#xD;
him to seek a more genial clime. To this course he was&#xD;
much opposed. His home-feeling was very strong, and his&#xD;
imagination clouded the prospect of leaving it with a thou-&#xD;
sand horrors. It was not until the voice of Miss Randolph&#xD;
mingled with the solicitations of his friends that he gave up&#xD;
his opposition, and commenced his preparations to spend the&#xD;
winter under a more southern sky.&#xD;
It was on a bright and sunny day in October that he rode&#xD;
over to Mr. Randolph's to bid Caroline adieu. As he rode&#xD;
along, every well-known object, every bird, every stream,&#xD;
and every tree seemed- to his fancy to entreat him to stay.&#xD;
He sighed deeply when he reflected how soon he should be&#xD;
parted from scenes and persons so loved, and dwelt in the&#xD;
probability that he should never see them again. As such&#xD;
thoughts rose before him, his face, like his feelings, became&#xD;
shadowed with melancholy. As he approached the house,&#xD;
he discovered the tall and graceful form of Caroline stand-&#xD;
ing in the door, as if she was awaiting his arrival, and he&#xD;
resolved to assume a cheerfulness he did not feel, to mitigate&#xD;
the gloom of the parting moment. He suppressed his emo-&#xD;
tions, and advanced and saluted her with a face beaming&#xD;
with pleasure. They soon passed into the house, and in her&#xD;
company the hours went by rapidly~and joyfully. Long and&#xD;
interesting to themselves was the conversation they held,&#xD;
and the westering sun told of the day's decline before either&#xD;
seemed to take any note of the flight of time. The dreaded&#xD;
moment at length arrived, and George rose to take leave.&#xD;
"~ Oh, do not leave me yet," she said, in a tone of entreaty,&#xD;
looking up at him; "stay a little longer. I would not lose&#xD;
a moment' for any consideration."&#xD;
He hesitated-grasped the hand which was extended to&#xD;
detain him, and. pressed it fervently to his lips; and then,&#xD;
as if overcome by her entreaty, resume his seat.&#xD;
"Would that it pleased Heaven that from your presence&#xD;
I might never depart," he said, in a low and melodious to~ie;&#xD;

&#xD;
"for the thought that I must leave you for months-.that a&#xD;
long and weary winter must pass away before I can again&#xD;
dwell on the calm majesty of that brow, the beauty of that&#xD;
eye, and the eloquence of that lip, is what makes the mo-&#xD;
ment of parting wormwood to me. As that hated moment&#xD;
approaches, the idolatry of my heart strengthens, and I feel&#xD;
more* keenly how necessary your presence is to my happi~&#xD;
ness. ~What I now feel is but an assurance to me that, when&#xD;
far from you, every hotir will be desolate and languid. How&#xD;
often will I, in fancy, revisit this spot, so loved and sacred to&#xD;
me, because it was here your lips first confessed affection for&#xD;
me, arid picture you the same devoted being you have always&#xD;
been to me."&#xD;
"And your fancy will not be illusive," said the gentle-&#xD;
hearted girl, with devotion in her eye as it dwelt earnestly&#xD;
on her lover's; "for, present or absent from you, my heart&#xD;
'will seek, will wish no change. Over the hills and over the&#xD;
waters that divide us, my thoughts will fly to you oftener&#xD;
than the coming round of the hours. I will not spend the&#xD;
days in sorrowing, but in indulging the most pleasing reflec-&#xD;
tions-~--reflecting on the thousand delights we have had to-&#xD;
gether, and anticipating the joy I shall feel when the time&#xD;
comes round when I shall welcome the wanderer back to his&#xD;
home with the glow of health renewed upon his cheek. In&#xD;
this way I will lighten the gloom of absence, and rescue the&#xD;
days from bitterness and regret."&#xD;
"A long and sullen winter must pass over your head be-&#xD;
fore I come back, and I trust you will not spend it in despond-&#xD;
,ency. When I return, the flowers will be blooming and the&#xD;
birds will again be singing, and my ardent hope will be that&#xD;
I may find you as gay and as bright as they are. Ellen and&#xD;
I will often talk of you when none but strange faces are near&#xD;
us. I often think I am most particularly blessed in enjoying&#xD;
the love of two such beings as yourself and my sister. I&#xD;
used to think my regard for her could not be equaled by any&#xD;
attachment I could form, but when my heart came to love&#xD;
you it became a divided empire. While for her I cherish&#xD;
an affection as pure and as holy as an angel's, for you I en-&#xD;
tertain a love the height and depth of which I can not meas-&#xD;
tire. How an ardent love for one who is worthy of it changes&#xD;
the condition of our feelings and the direction of our thoughts!&#xD;
It changes the whole of the shifting scenes of life. It is like&#xD;
religion, for it is a spark from a heavenly flame, coming 4owu&#xD;
upon the heart, and consuming all its dross and grossness,&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
recalling our wandering thoughts md wayward fancies, and&#xD;
fixing them deeply and devotedly on one adored object."&#xD;
"You speak as if you were pro~npted by my own experi..&#xD;
ence, for before my heart was yoi rs I felt a vague and in-&#xD;
definable yearning for something pure and noble around&#xD;
which my affections might entwne themselves. I longed&#xD;
for some one into whose ear my confiding spirit might breathe&#xD;
every thought and sentiment, with the knowledge tl~at they&#xD;
would meet with a just appreciation. I wanted some idol&#xD;
before which my thoughts might bc;w down and worship, and&#xD;
whose smile would always be propitiouS. In you," she con-&#xD;
tinued, more passionately, "in you my heart recognizes such&#xD;
an idol, and you need no assurance at this time of the devo-&#xD;
tion with which I worship it. The love I feel, you may well&#xD;
say, comes down from heaven, and resembles religion. Is'&#xD;
such the love of man's heart, for I had fancied it was for&#xD;
woman alone to cherish such a pttssion ?"&#xD;
"Oh yes, it is thus that men Ao sometimes feel," returned&#xD;
George, ardently. "Love is far from being perfect when it&#xD;
does not encompass all our thought.~ and feelings. True love&#xD;
uproots every selfish weed from the heart, and prepares us&#xD;
to give any proof, even that of death itself, of our fidelity.&#xD;
When we love truly, the object of o~ir devotion is always pres-&#xD;
ent to us, and we can not do what that object would con-&#xD;
demn, even if our conduct should 1e known but to ourselves.&#xD;
Every hope and expectation we cherish must design the hap-&#xD;
piness of the being loved; for whei~. we desire what will only&#xD;
contribute to our own pleasure, we do not love. The proof&#xD;
of the passion is that we prefer another to ourself. We wish,&#xD;
when under its influence, for opportunities to signalize our&#xD;
d6vQtion by sacrificing our own interests and pleasures for the&#xD;
sake of the one we love. And this is love, Caroline! It is&#xD;
an unworldly feeling. It is not that common desire which&#xD;
animates the hearts of those who call themselves lovers, but&#xD;
who only think of advancing their own happiness. This&#xD;
self-sacrificing feeling is the most heaven-like of all that the&#xD;
heart knows. On it the defilement of earth does not rest.&#xD;
It assimilates us to the nature of the angels, and is the sun-&#xD;
shine under whose genial influence are developed in the&#xD;
human heart the germs of those flowers which are to bloom&#xD;
in unfa~ding beauty beyond the stars."&#xD;
"It is for woman to feel the lovc you describe," said Car-&#xD;
oline; "it is for her to cherish a feeling to which she would&#xD;
sacrifice every hope and prospect in life. It is ~skin~ too&#xD;

much of man to require him to surrender all selfishness, and&#xD;
offer up all his worldly interests on the:altar of love~"&#xD;
"I spoke from ~i~iy own heart, Caroline. I believe that&#xD;
human nature is slandered by those who ascribe its noblest&#xD;
impulses to a love of self. If we could but look at what is&#xD;
passing in many hearts around us, which on a superficial&#xD;
view seem to us to be cold and selfish, we should often see&#xD;
devotion of the holiest kind. Thi~re is infinitely more of the&#xD;
romance of love in the world than we suspect. Around us,&#xD;
on all sides, experience is weaving webs of golden threads,&#xD;
on which are pictures of purity and devotion surpassing all&#xD;
that fiction, with its pencil of light, dares to portray. They&#xD;
wrong humaAnity who judge of what is not seen by what is&#xD;
palpable, for the heart treasures and hides from the glare of&#xD;
day and4he eyes~ of the many its most sacred possessions.&#xD;
Deep and devoted love is a most perilous passion; for if the&#xD;
flowers that grow up under its benignity should fade before&#xD;
the blight and the frost, the distress of the heart thus strip-&#xD;
ped is incalculable. The woman who trusts her happiness&#xD;
to such a dangerous passion is either most blessed or most&#xD;
wretched. There is no night so deep, so rayless, as that whose&#xD;
gloom settles down on the soul of the one who is called to&#xD;
mourn the extinction of the hope which is most sun-like on&#xD;
all that shine in the heaven above our hearts."&#xD;
George rose once more to leave, and as he extended his&#xD;
hand, and looked earnestly on the fair face which he might&#xD;
probably see no more, a shudder passed over his frame and&#xD;
tears glistened in his eyes.&#xD;
"Good-by-farewell-God bless you, my own dear Car-&#xD;
oline !" he ejaculated faintly, as he drew her to his bosotn&#xD;
and impressed a kiss on her lip. He endeavored to look&#xD;
cheerful, but, in spite of his efforts, the shadow of a deep mel-&#xD;
ancholy rested on his features.&#xD;
" Oh! take care of yourself, for remember my happiness&#xD;
is inseparable blended with your existence," said Caroline,&#xD;
as her head bowed to her lover's Josom.&#xD;
Another lingering and wild embrace, and then a word of&#xD;
encouragement, and he tore himself away and walked rap-&#xD;
idly from her presence. He was soon mounted, and, turn-&#xD;
ing, beheld the form of Caroline in the door. He waved his&#xD;
hand in silence, an4 in a few moments disappeared from her&#xD;
* sight, and she was left alone to brood, over her hopes and&#xD;
* fears-to feel the intensest solitude we can know, a separa-&#xD;

CHAPT]~R XXIII.&#xD;
DRAYTON continued to visit Oakwood, after George and&#xD;
his sister had left, as frequently as before. Colonel Mere-&#xD;
dith complained of his loneliness, and always gave his young&#xD;
friend a hearty and joyous welcome. From his conversation,&#xD;
enriched as it generally was with the fruits of extensive&#xD;
reading and the experience of many years, Drayton learned&#xD;
much. He would listen with pleasure to the colonel through&#xD;
the hours of the long winter evenings, forgetful of the flight&#xD;
of time. The colonel took great delight in imparting his&#xD;
opinions to him, as an olderlman always does to a younger&#xD;
one who regards him with profound attention. The storm&#xD;
might roar without, but within the cheer was always warm.&#xD;
One evening they were sitting together in the library,&#xD;
whither, as was their custom, they had retired after supper.&#xD;
The fire blazed brightly in the hearth. The night was&#xD;
stormy, and the, snow-flakes beat violently against the win-&#xD;
dow. Not a star was abroad. ~O~ver the heavens hung a&#xD;
dark and impenetrable cloud, and all without was as gloomy&#xD;
as a stricken spirit which refuses consolation. lit was an&#xD;
evening on which a misanthropic heart would have sighed&#xD;
for the delights of the social circle, and when the friendly&#xD;
heart warms as ~t contemplates the cheerful appearance of&#xD;
every thing within doors, and contrasts it with the terror&#xD;
and the wildness without.&#xD;
Who has not experienced the delights which seem so pe-&#xD;
culiarly well adapted to the long and cold evenings of win-&#xD;
ter, when we mingle with our friends and make ourselves&#xD;
the merrier because the heavens and the earth are shrouded&#xD;
in gloom? When the stars above us grow dim, the star of&#xD;
friendship grows brighter. We listen to the raging elements,&#xD;
and. cling closer -and more confidingly to those who are near&#xD;
us. Our benevolent feelings expand over our misanthropy&#xD;
like, the rainbow over the dark cloud, and all that we have&#xD;

seeu and felt in timesgone by comes up before our rcfresfred&#xD;
minds, and we most affectionately yea impart the hived&#xD;
treasures of o~ur memories to the friend on the opposite side&#xD;
of the table, ~whose good nature, as he leans on his elbow&#xD;
and smiles on us, inclines him to relish what, perhaps, he&#xD;
would have voted a bore during the sultriness of the sum-&#xD;
mer solstice. We fancy, then, that the ticking of th~ snow&#xD;
~nd hail against our windows, and the holdings of the winds&#xD;
as they sweep by, make music decidedly more exquisite than&#xD;
birds, and zephyrs, and tumbling waters ever made. We&#xD;
crown the houts wit~ roses as they fleet, like sylphs, on their&#xD;
destined courses, while, unconscious of raving winds aud mid.&#xD;
night's gloomy peals, we prolong our sitting through the&#xD;
* depths of the night in converse, which, by turns, is joyous and&#xD;
profound.&#xD;
An hour had passed since supper, and they had been, talk-&#xD;
ing of books and men. A~pause in the conversation ensued,&#xD;
during which they listened to the winds as they swept by,&#xD;
now rising and whistling like demons in each crevice, and&#xD;
now sinking and moaning like the lamentations of a be-&#xD;
reaved heart. As they listened, louder rose the gales, until&#xD;
they howled like a legion of famishing wolves; and when.&#xD;
they read~ied~their height, Drayton. said,&#xD;
"Hi~w I like those sounds~! They rouse one's imagina-&#xD;
tion and send it abroad, careering~~with the storm amid the&#xD;
creaking cordage of the ship, as she rocks to and fro on the&#xD;
t~n~table bosom of the ocean. In fancy, at this moment, I&#xD;
e~w see the billows breaking wrathfully over the sides of a&#xD;
doomed vessel, while the dark forms of the sturdy mariners&#xD;
flit from post to post, to guard their ship from the perils that&#xD;
surround them. What power, colonel, habit has, and how it&#xD;
reconciles men to every situation in life6 Now, were you&#xD;
and. I in the condition of those seamen I have been fancy-&#xD;
ing, we would expect to encounter death in every blast, and&#xD;
thi~4 we saw the scythe of the gloomy old tyrant in the form&#xD;
of every wave that broke over us, while perhaps the hardy&#xD;
sailor would stand at our sides chewing his cud, and dream-&#xD;
ing of the delights which would await him when he reached&#xD;
the destined port."&#xD;
'0fhe seaman is used to such dangers," said the colonel;&#xD;
he has encountered them a thousand times before, and his&#xD;
familiarity with them has bred contempt fo~ what we would&#xD;
shrink from. I fancy that if we were, exposed to the terrific&#xD;
4ieoharges~ of artillery that many a soldier contemplated&#xD;
&#xD;
without a shudder, we should think our chan~es-of escape&#xD;
very few. But th~4~Jd campaigner only thinks of victory;&#xD;
and here, agaiii, you perceivee how familiarity with *langer'&#xD;
lessens our dread of it. So, also, an old toper imbibes his&#xD;
favorite beverage with a contempt for quantity, which seems&#xD;
marvelous to one unused to such deep potatiQns."&#xD;
After a pause of a moment, the colonel asked, "What&#xD;
books are those on ~the table near you, Mr. Drayton ?"&#xD;
"Boswell's Johnson, Bacon's Essays, and Burke's Speech-&#xD;
es," replied Drayton, glancing at their titles.&#xD;
"All favorites of mine," said Colonel Meredith. "Sup-&#xD;
pose you open Bacon, and read his essays on Truth and Love."&#xD;
Drayton took up the volume and read the essays tl~ col-&#xD;
onel designated, and when he concluded, a conversation on&#xD;
some of the great men of England followed.&#xD;
"And who do you think was the greatest m~n in the Long&#xD;
parliament ?" inquired Drayton.&#xD;
"John Hampden was decidedly the greatest man, al-&#xD;
though perhaps Cromwell, Pym, and some others excelled&#xD;
him in brilliance and genius. But he combined more of the&#xD;
high moral qualities of the reformer with his fine intellect&#xD;
than any of his contemporaries. At such periods, when a na-&#xD;
tion is rocking in the cradle of revolution, and when the ele-&#xD;
ments of disorder are let loose, such men as Hampdexi seem&#xD;
to be raised up by Providence to be the political saviors of&#xD;
the people. By their prudence, moderation, and firmness,&#xD;
they bring order out of chaos, and save a nation from the&#xD;
evils and crimes of anarchy. At such times there are al-&#xD;
ways more hot spirits burning for change than prudent ones&#xD;
to direct the currents which are in motion to profitable issues;&#xD;
and if it were not for Hlampdens and Washingtons, rev4lu-&#xD;
tions in government would always be fraught with incalcu-&#xD;
lable evils."&#xD;
"It is a pity," said Drayton-and his remarks indicated&#xD;
the party in politics to which he was attached.-" that France,&#xD;
in her late* revolution, contained so few men of the class yo~i&#xD;
refer to-men of great abilities and high moral characters,&#xD;
to ~ecure to her the good Which many of her eminent and&#xD;
philanthropic philosophers anticipated~ There never was a&#xD;
more righteous~~t~uggle fo~r freedom from the most blighting&#xD;
oppression; never were more ardent hopes of political good&#xD;
cherished; and never, in the annals of our race, was a holy&#xD;
cause so w~etehediy mismanaged. From amid the darkness&#xD;
of 1;hat struggle, many solemn lessons to princes and to peo..&#xD;

pie flash up with the intense glare of lightning, teaching&#xD;
kings who -'are despotic that a terrible retribution awaits&#xD;
them, and teaching the niasses that if they confide import-&#xD;
ant trusts to unprincipled rulers, even though they spring&#xD;
from among themselves, they must expect to be overwhelmed&#xD;
with disaster and disappointment. Had France possessed a.&#xD;
few sterling and sound-hearted patriot&amp;amp; like our Washing-&#xD;
ton, Jefferson, Adams, Hancock~ and others, an incalculable&#xD;
amount of good would have grown out of her struggle. It is&#xD;
mournful to compare the glorious beginning with the infa-&#xD;
mous termination of that Revolution. But the struggle was&#xD;
not in vain, although the Harpies and the Furies seem to have&#xD;
been the principal spirits who presided over its destinies,"&#xD;
"The French lost the hopes that animated them, and be-&#xD;
came traitors to the cause of Liberty when they desecrated&#xD;
their Revolution by making it revengeful," said Colonel Mer-&#xD;
edith, with a manner that proved the interest he took in the&#xD;
subject. "Revolution," he continued, elevating his voice,&#xD;
"is a just but an awfully responsible remedy, when the sin-&#xD;
fulness ofrulers cries aloud to Heaven; but when a Revolu-&#xD;
tion, instead of reforming abuses, goes on in a spirit of re-&#xD;
taliation to avenge injuries, it loses its sacred character, and&#xD;
becomes as offensive in the sight of Heaven as the abuses&#xD;
which it undertook to remove. Had the French only aimed&#xD;
at removing oppression and guarant~eiug rights, their Revo-&#xD;
lution might have been as successful as ours. But France&#xD;
became infatuated with success-drunk with the first vic-&#xD;
tories she gained over her tyrants, and then she reeled and&#xD;
staggered like an intoxicated giant, and, having no respect&#xD;
for the laws of Heaven or the opinions of the world, perpe-&#xD;
trated those horrible enormities which are without a paral-&#xD;
lel in the blood-stained history of our species. Faith was&#xD;
what France needed. The French lost all faith in Heaven&#xD;
and in humanity, and that was the prominent reason why&#xD;
their revolutionary struggle failed in securing to them the&#xD;
benefits for which it was undertaken. Faith is necessary to&#xD;
the sanctification of any cause, and without that light from&#xD;
Heaven which always shines on prayerful spirits, men inva-&#xD;
riably grope in darkness. Without it a nation can not be&#xD;
lifted up to catch the smiles of an approving Heaven, and to&#xD;
feel those blessed influences which reigned in Eden. Faith&#xD;
borrows energy from that despair which overwhelms the i-in-&#xD;
believing. Look how it nerved the arms of the Amerioau&#xD;
patriots, when the star of Liberty, struggling with mists, shone&#xD;

hut dimly on our cause! Had those patriots not been men&#xD;
of unflinching faith, they would have thrown down their&#xD;
,arms and succumbed to oppression when the probabilities of&#xD;
success were against them. But faith winged the spirits of&#xD;
those true ancf good men, and, soaring beyond the dark pres-&#xD;
ent, they caught gleams of the bright day that was to dawn&#xD;
our political destinies."&#xD;
"The men you refer to, colonel, were eminentlygond and&#xD;
wise. Do you suppose that if our country were again plunged&#xD;
into such a crisis, we should see, their like ?"&#xD;
"Yes," replied the colonel, firmly. "Our country has not&#xD;
yet reached the Sodom-like depths of iniquity, when, if a&#xD;
thousand righteous men were required for her salVation, she&#xD;
would be destroyed for want of them. Whenever occasion&#xD;
shall demand the presence and the counsels of good men,&#xD;
they will come forth from their solitudes and assume the&#xD;
post and the bearing of demigods. And yet these men, when&#xD;
peace prevails, live and die, and have no canonization, for&#xD;
they are known but to the few who appreciate their ability&#xD;
and integrity. I know men now leading quiet lives, who,&#xD;
if they believed the liberties of this nation in jeopardy, would&#xD;
come forth and assume the rule, exert themselves like he-&#xD;
roes, and become renowned."&#xD;
"I like to speculate," said Drayton, thoughtfully, follow-&#xD;
ing out the train of reflections suggested by the colonel's&#xD;
last remark, "on the influence exerted over men by the cir-&#xD;
cumstances in which they live. I do not believe that a man&#xD;
of strong and decided character owes much of his intrinsic&#xD;
excellence to circumstances, for they only shape the course&#xD;
which such a one pursues. They are but as the winds which&#xD;
propel the vessel, but, whether they drive her to the north or&#xD;
the' south, she remains unchanged in all but the direction she&#xD;
takes. If it had not been for our RevQlution, Washington&#xD;
might be know~i only as a firm, judicious, upright man, and&#xD;
would probably die unknown to the world. Had not the&#xD;
French Revolution taken place, Mirabeau would have been&#xD;
known only as a wild and profligate wretch, who would nQt&#xD;
hesitate to trample on all the sanctities of life to gratify his&#xD;
uncurbed passions. If Leo the Tenth had not anthori~ed&#xD;
the sale of indulgences, Martin Luther's name would have&#xD;
died with the century which gave him birth; and without&#xD;
the happy influences which prevail in this land, where ge-&#xD;
nius and talent enjoy the prerogatives of their nobility and&#xD;
government, how maiiy Americans at present distinguished&#xD;

would have been rotting away in obscurity! It is true, the&#xD;
circumstances in which these men were placed did not en-&#xD;

The thoughts that Drayton expressed had long been fa-&#xD;
miliar to him. Notwithstanding poverty and an ungenial&#xD;
occupation stifled~ma~ny of the aspirations of his boyhood, yet&#xD;
his was not a spirit to surrender tamely to circumstances.&#xD;
He believed he could subdue circumstances and bend them&#xD;
to his coiitrol, and this belief had afforded him great conso-&#xD;
lation during the darker days of his vassalage. Many and&#xD;
beautiful were the dreams he even then. cherished, which&#xD;
owed their existence to the faith he haa in his own power to&#xD;
rise .superior to the lot which at that time was his. Nor&#xD;
were his those hazy reveries so common in which each. scene&#xD;
is indistinct, and beats but little resemblance to the pictures&#xD;
drawn by the master-hand of experience on the canvaS of&#xD;
life. He had read and reflected much on the careers of the&#xD;
great men who, starting from the humblest paths of the val-&#xD;
ley, have climbed up to the dizzy eminences of fame. His&#xD;
heart had often burned within him as he thought that he&#xD;
too might become one of that band of immortal spirits whose&#xD;
brows are shaded by the laurel that fades not. And now&#xD;
that manhood, with its widened views, was on him, he still&#xD;
clung with unabated fondness to the vision which had led&#xD;
his boyish steps into unfrequented places, and scattered the&#xD;
rays of romance on his dreaming brow.&#xD;
- He had much of that blending of enthusiasm and enter-&#xD;
prise-the poetical and~ the practical qualities of m~nd-~-.&#xD;
which has led so many of our countrymen from the lowliest&#xD;
to the Loftiest stations in society and government. There is&#xD;
an~ instinctive love in the superior mind, inducing it to ad-&#xD;
mire and reverence greatness of mental power wherever it&#xD;
is manifested. It feels that it c~n claim kindred with those&#xD;
specimens of heaven-created nobility jt loves to contemplate.&#xD;
In their careers it fancies its own is mirrored, and it gazes&#xD;
on the picture thus formed until its eye reflects no other im-&#xD;
age. No youth fitted to excel in poetry ever regarded the&#xD;
strpggle~of the bards who have preceded him without a feel-&#xD;
ing of iMeuse sympathy witW all their trials, for without a&#xD;
sympathy of this kind there can be but little likeness in char-&#xD;
acter or career. No young American~ born to sway in any&#xD;
eonsi&amp;amp;erable agree the~destinies of our government, can view&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
~ 1,&#xD;
&#xD;
R&#xD;
&#xD;
with coldness the histories of our Henry, Franklin, and Sher-&#xD;
man. It is a safe assertion, that if a youth lacks a generous&#xD;
sympathy with the struggles of men who have risen to re-&#xD;
nqwn, he can not become truly eminent. This feeling alone,&#xD;
though the harbinger, is not th~ guarantee of success, for a.&#xD;
conviction. must accompany it that the power to execute the&#xD;
loftiest resolves of his soulbelongs to the aspirant. Heaven&#xD;
has not left us without an. oracle in the heart, which, when.&#xD;
rightly consulted, proclaims our destiny; and if a youth does&#xD;
not feel it to be the will of Heaven that he shall climb the&#xD;
eminences which loom far away before his ambitious eye, he&#xD;
is one of the obscure million, and no exertion he makes can&#xD;
possibly effect a revocation of the decree of his fate. But if,&#xD;
on the contrary, you feel an all-compelling necessity to rise&#xD;
-if you are assured by the infallible evidences of your own&#xD;
nature that you are a member of that, order of nobility&#xD;
which is patented by Heaven alone.-if you have the restless&#xD;
energy of spirit which will not uncomplainingly submit to&#xD;
be shackled by society or circumstance-take~- courage, be&#xD;
diligent, be resolute of heart, and the wreath and the halo&#xD;
may be yours.&#xD;
Such thoughts were familiar to Drayton's mind long be-&#xD;
fore he had renounced his early occupation and began to&#xD;
read law. He would return to them again and again ,when&#xD;
his heart was oppressed, lingering over them with as much&#xD;
pleasure as ever lover felt while dwelling on the remem-&#xD;
brance of the smile of his mistress. The intense and burn-&#xD;
ing sympathy he experienced while pondering on the early&#xD;
struggles of renowned men, first produced the conviction that~&#xD;
he too could overcome the difficulties which hemmed him&#xD;
within narrow limits-that he too could pass the rugged&#xD;
Alps that rose with frowning cliffs to obstruct his way-and&#xD;
that in his arm reposed the might to break the threads by&#xD;
which untoward circumstances had bound him down to an&#xD;
humble and ungenial vocation.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
TILE leading event of the year, and one which shrouded&#xD;
the nation in mourning, was the death of the great, the wise,&#xD;
the good Washington. He, on whom all eyes were turned&#xD;

A,.&#xD;

138             DRAYTON.                                                 PI~AYTQN.&#xD;
&#xD;
in times of peril. for protection, had joined the company of&#xD;
the immortals beyond the grave. There was not a heart so&#xD;
dead to a sense of superior merit in others as to refuse to&#xD;
yield to his unparalleled excellence the lofty eulogiurn which,&#xD;
by common consent, is awarded to him. Sadness was heavy&#xD;
on every brow, and tones of lamentation trembled on every&#xD;
lip. Even those tongues which had dared to assail the&#xD;
character of Mount Vernon's sage, while reprobating some&#xD;
of the measures of his administration, now that his God-like&#xD;
form could be seen no more in the habitations of men, united&#xD;
with all others in pronouncing tributes of respect to the trans-&#xD;
cendent merits of the great man whose warning voice could&#xD;
not reach them from beyond the silence of the tomb. From&#xD;
every hill and from every valley throughout the land, which&#xD;
his valor had protected and his wisdom governed, came the&#xD;
moaning strains of grief from grateful. hearts. A great man&#xD;
truly had fallen in Israel, and the whole country united in&#xD;
expressing the feeling of the loss it had sustained by funeral&#xD;
processions, sermons, and eulogiums. Never before did grief&#xD;
burst from the startled heart of a nation so universally, and&#xD;
never before lived and died a man who so justly deserved&#xD;
such a tribute of respect.&#xD;
The city of was not slow in adopting measures by&#xD;
which to give public attestation of the sense of the loss.which&#xD;
the country had sustained. A funeral procession was ordered,&#xD;
and Colonel Meredith was selected to deliver a eulogium on&#xD;
the father of his country. When the appointed day arrived,&#xD;
every store and every shop was closed-the merchant for-&#xD;
sook his ledger and the mechanic the implements of his voca-&#xD;
tion-all business was suspended, and a hush deeper than&#xD;
that of the Sabbath prevailed over the busy thoroughfares&#xD;
of the ciii.&#xD;
Twelv~o'clock came. A procession, with slow and solemn~&#xD;
steps, mo~d along the principal streets. . The sounds of the&#xD;
muffled drum broke sadly over the silence of the city. The&#xD;
multitude proceeded to the largest church, which was soon&#xD;
crowded almost to suffocation. An ode was sung-a prayer&#xD;
was offered up-and all eyes were turned toward the pulpit,&#xD;
when the tail and commanding form of Colonel Meredith&#xD;
rose with the dignity and majesty of a Roman- senator in the&#xD;
best days of the Commonwealth. His countenance was full&#xD;
of the solemnity of the occasion as his eye wandered over&#xD;
the breathing and expecting mass of beings before him.. The&#xD;
tones of his voice, at first low, gradually swelled with a&#xD;
&#xD;
wider and deeper compass over the thousands whose eager&#xD;
eyes watched every motion of the orator's lips.&#xD;
The colonel's words were generally more eloquent than&#xD;
his manner. He was a. logical and impressive, though not&#xD;
a brilliant orator. Wisdom marked his thoughts, and con-&#xD;
viction generally followed his periods, when practicing at&#xD;
the bar - and onthe present occasion his object was to place&#xD;
a vivid portraiture of Washing~ton before the minds of all&#xD;
who listened to him. After reviewing his life and the serv- -&#xD;
ices he had rendered the country, he pronounced a just, but&#xD;
not inflated, eulogy on his character.&#xD;
"It is admitted," said the orator, with a .deep voice and&#xD;
majestic manner, as he approached the conclusion of his ad-&#xD;
dress-" it is admitted that, among the great and good men&#xD;
whose deeds have been considered worthy of commemora-&#xD;
tion by states and people, our Washington stands in the first&#xD;
rank. This admission is extorted by his sublime merits&#xD;
even from the prejudiced and reluctant. minds of the Old&#xD;
World; but we claim for our hero, without the least arro-&#xD;
gance of pretension, preeminence over all others. No one&#xD;
presumes to deny him wisdom art4 sagacity in council, in-&#xD;
trepidity and prudence in war, and modesty and uprightness&#xD;
in private life. Every deed of his public career was unself-&#xD;
ish, and aimed exclusively at the good of the people whom&#xD;
he loved and served:; and every act of his private life threw&#xD;
additional luster round' a character which it should be the&#xD;
duty of every American to reverence and imitate. Look at&#xD;
the demigods shrine in the Pantheon at Rome! Which&#xD;
one of them, with his solemn and majestic brow, was the&#xD;
equal of our Washington? Look on that mighty procession&#xD;
of heroes~who pass before the eye as we turn over the pages&#xD;
of Plutarch! Which of those stern and inflexible heroes&#xD;
combined in his character all the mental greatness and moral&#xD;
sublimity of him whom America mourtis? Was it Theseus,&#xD;
Timoleon, or Numa-Pericles, Philopci~men, or Cato? The&#xD;
mightiest of those giants who tower above all others among&#xD;
the fallen monuments of the past, with the eternally-green&#xD;
shadow of the laurel upon their sublime heads, do not rise&#xD;
up to the full stature of the man by whose genius the polit-&#xD;
ical regeneration of our country was effected, and by whose&#xD;
wisdom its first steps were directed to the path which leads&#xD;
to renown.&#xD;
"The secret of Washington's greatness and success is to be&#xD;
found' in his earnest devotion to what he considered his duty.&#xD;
&#xD;

140           DRAYTON.                                         DRAYTON.           141&#xD;
&#xD;
No one of the unsubstantial phantoms of glory ever lured&#xD;
him for a moment from his country's interests. Had ~death&#xD;
or a dereliction of duty' been presented to him, no one ac-&#xD;
quainted with him can doubt his choice. He would at any&#xD;
time have bowed his honored head in the gloom of the grave&#xD;
rather than have survived the immolation of his conviction&#xD;
of right. Most other men have achieved their honors by de-&#xD;
voting themselves to one great and noble pursuit, but Wash-&#xD;
ington was great in many callings. He was great as a sol-&#xD;
'dier, greater as a statesman, but greatest as a. man. From&#xD;
youth to age, and under ~al1 the changes of his life, he was&#xD;
always and inflexibly the same. Some men rise, on favor-&#xD;
ing occasions, with ~the suddenness and blinding brilliance of&#xD;
meteors, and, blazing for a while, fade away into the realms&#xD;
of night; but Washington, like a serene and lustrous planet,&#xD;
passed over our sky, and sunk beneath the horizon with ev-&#xD;
ery beam unshorn. His sole ambitio~~, was to do good. In&#xD;
his heart selfishness never took root, and his governing de-&#xD;
sire was to be useful in his day and generation. How nobly&#xD;
did he discharge the fearful trusts confided to him? With&#xD;
what self-sacrificing devotion he assisted in building up this&#xD;
nation's independence! In his presence calumny was dumb,&#xD;
and the tongue of slander was impotent! Up to the eleva-&#xD;
tion which he reached, and on the sun-like brilliance of his&#xD;
qualities, the eye of jealousy dared not look!&#xD;
"If it should be the misfortune of this nation, in the rev-&#xD;
olutions of coming centuries, again to be involved in a con-&#xD;
test between usurpation and human rights, the example of&#xD;
Washington will exert a saving influence; for great men,&#xD;
anxious to secure to themselves the highest honors on this&#xD;
side of Heaven's throne, will make it their proudest ambi-&#xD;
tion to emulate his conduct. And if, during any future event-&#xD;
ful conflict of arms, the champions 'of human freedom shall&#xD;
be beaten back with torn banners by the enemies of liberty,&#xD;
the spirit of Washington will appear in the thickest of the&#xD;
fight, cheering the soldiers of the free, as the shade of The-&#xD;
sons cheered the retreating Athenians on the plains of Mar-&#xD;
athpn, and thus led on, they will return to the charge, and&#xD;
drive the foot of the usurper from this sacred soil.&#xD;
"It is well to commemorate the life and services of such&#xD;
a man. Let your children early learn to reverence his name.&#xD;
Let monuments erected to his memory pierce the clouds&#xD;
Let every token of respect from grateful hearts be offered to&#xD;
the manes of him who stands amid the brilliant throngs of&#xD;
&#xD;
the redeemed beyond yon crystal vaults, the tallest and most&#xD;
God-like of them all.&#xD;
"'Such honors Ilium to her hero paid,&#xD;
And peaceful slept the xiii7ghty Hector's shade."'&#xD;
Among the thousands who heard the oration, tJiere was&#xD;
not one who listened to it with more profound attention than&#xD;
Drayton. He was in the habit of observing speakers of merit&#xD;
closely, for the purpose of discovering the means by which&#xD;
they produced their efFect. While listening to the colonel,&#xD;
his heart burned for an opportunity to appear before the pub-&#xD;
lic. He felt that if an occasion were offered him, he could'&#xD;
produce an effect highly honorable to himself. His soul had&#xD;
grown restless through the many months during which he&#xD;
had waited in vain for the coming round of the hour in which&#xD;
he was to appear before the public as a speaker, arid to make&#xD;
an exhibition of all the powers with which he was endowed.&#xD;
The young and as yet untried enthusiast always thinks that&#xD;
an occasion is the one thing needful, and he awaits it with&#xD;
burning impatience. His heart pants for the hour of trial.&#xD;
He is willing to stake his future fortunes on the success of&#xD;
his first effort. Before his imagination such scenes come up&#xD;
oftener than the day. There is the rapt and admiring crowd,&#xD;
and the plaudits of thousands repaying the youthful orator&#xD;
for the heartsickness of expectation. The inspired look, the&#xD;
resistless logic, the flashing eye, the imperial eloquence are&#xD;
his. He is the God-like actor; the mind that stirs' and the&#xD;
plaudits so heart-cheering belong to him. Thus hoping and&#xD;
dreaming of unlimited success, the enthusiast lives on. At&#xD;
length the momentous occasion so long desired arrives; the&#xD;
hour comes on; with palpitating heart he begins the effort&#xD;
which is henceforth to make his name famous. He com-&#xD;
mences, he stammers, and stumbles on; disappointment is&#xD;
pictured on every f~.ce, and his failure is signal. This is the&#xD;
experience of ninety-and-nine in every hundred ardent en-&#xD;
thusiasts who dream that the power of Henry or Clay be-&#xD;
longs to them. Alas! pai~it a blacker scene than the mid-&#xD;
night storm, aud then fancy the blackness of the desolation&#xD;
which comes down upon the disappointed youth whose hopes&#xD;
have been flowering through many seasons only to be blight-&#xD;
ed in an hour.&#xD;
But your sanguine dreamer dwells on no such storms and&#xD;
darkness before the hour, so pregnant with importance to&#xD;
him, comes on. Hobo. is his idol, and he worships at her&#xD;
shrine most devoutly. "Like some gay creature of the eke-&#xD;

~xn~nts," midway from earth to heaven, she appears to him,&#xD;
with her brow radiant with promise and her lip breathir~g&#xD;
his praise. She beckons to him from afar, and with a grace-&#xD;
ful sweep of her ~.rm she points upward to the shadowy Al-&#xD;
pine eminence in the realm of Fame,, on which his feet are&#xD;
to wander. Often, during the lone watches of the night, she&#xD;
visits him in his study, and, like a weird sibyl, foretells the&#xD;
brilliant destiny and the many honors that are in reserve&#xD;
for him. His too credulous heart receives these visions of&#xD;
his ardent fancy as if they were revelations from Heaven.&#xD;
Before him spreads a summer sea, and his is the most gal-&#xD;
lant of all the gay barks sporting on its bosom. That dis-&#xD;
appointment, probably, will wrinkle the brow and silver the&#xD;
head of such a visionary, all know, for all experience concurs&#xD;
in pronouncing Hope the most unscrupulous flirt that ever&#xD;
trifled with the human heart.&#xD;
It makes the heart sick to recall the number of promising&#xD;
youths whom one has seen wrecked on ambition's treacher-&#xD;
ous wave. The aspirants are in number as the stars, while&#xD;
the successful are but as the planets. And yet, despite the&#xD;
failure of the million, the one will be bold and dare to dream&#xD;
of victory. The field is still beautiful to the fancy, and the&#xD;
banner of Fame, waving above it, is gorgeous to behold, and,&#xD;
looking at it, the young heart forgets the myriads who there&#xD;
lie sepulchered.' A few veterans are there,' with laurel-&#xD;
shaded brows, and the votary thinks of the i~urel's shade, and&#xD;
not of the unhonored grave. Is it not strange that, not-&#xD;
withstanding the experience of the multitude, the one will&#xD;
still continue to dream that there is something peculiar in&#xD;
him' which will exempt him from the common destiny?&#xD;
But it is well that the heart should be self-confiding, for the&#xD;
feet of the weak-souled have never yet reached the summit&#xD;
of the Pisgah which overlooks the sun-bright land of promise.&#xD;
Be self'relying, then, and ffrm of purpose, and essay the re-&#xD;
alization of the most brilliant destiny that wild desire in her&#xD;
frantic moods ever drew on the, curtain of the' future, for&#xD;
there is no~success without such art attempt.&#xD;
Drayton, too, was a dreamer,~but he was fa~ from being&#xD;
a visionary youth. His strong common sense rescued his&#xD;
dreams from the domination of folly; and, when looking ~t&#xD;
the future, he did not suffer his fancy to triumph over his&#xD;
sagacity. The loftiest minds that have conferred dignity on&#xD;
the intellectual character of man have been dreamer of this&#xD;
class, for such always dream of success 'before attempting to&#xD;
&#xD;
win 'it. At times Drayton gave himself up to luxurious&#xD;
reveries, and then his spiritual visitants were as hazy as the&#xD;
spirits which Ossian saw in the moon's pale beams, and&#xD;
glittering thoughts reeled through his mind as devious and&#xD;
yet as beautiful as a troop of butterflies sporting in the air&#xD;
on a summer's mdrn. But; generally, his dreams were not&#xD;
the illusions of fancy, for they were modeled on what others&#xD;
had achieved. He hoped for much, and he had sufficient&#xD;
faith in his ability to carve out a successful career. It is&#xD;
true of him, as of all others who hope, that when the occa-&#xD;
sion his heart pants for arrives, he will be plunged, if he&#xD;
fails, to unfathomable depths of distress, but, if successful,&#xD;
he will ride the topmost' wave.&#xD;
'CHAPTER' XXV.&#xD;
BEFORE leaving his home for the South, George Meredith&#xD;
had requested Drayton to call often on Miss Randolph. To&#xD;
this request he attended as much from his own inclinations&#xD;
as from a desire to comply with the promise .he had made&#xD;
to his friend, for she 4ways extended a~ cordial welcome&#xD;
to him, and entertained' him with conversations which dis-&#xD;
played her rich and varied mental resources. He also fre-&#xD;
quently met' her in town at the parties, at which places she&#xD;
was always an object of prominent interest. On such oc-&#xD;
casions she' was uniformly cheerful, and sometimes gay; and&#xD;
no one would have suspected the heaviness which often op-&#xD;
pressed her heart, from her glad smile and merry. voice. It&#xD;
was, however, rather from a deference to George's wishes&#xD;
than her own that she consented to be present amid 'these&#xD;
social gayeties;' and she often repaired with a. sad, brow&#xD;
from scenes where she had. appeared as gay' as the most&#xD;
thoughtless belle who felt her rivalry.&#xD;
But she was a different being when alone. Then the&#xD;
sentiments of herheart were unmasked and legible in every&#xD;
act. Oftentimes, 'after an evening devoted to hilarity, she&#xD;
would reproach herself for her levity, as the thought that&#xD;
her lover might at that time be experiencing all the agonies&#xD;
of a sick-bed in a land of strangers would come over her&#xD;
heart like a storm over the brightness of a May morning.&#xD;

&#xD;
Sadness, however, was by no ~iieans he~ predominant mood,&#xD;
for-iew ever encouraged more exciting hopes under so gloomy&#xD;
a sI~y. At times, in spite of-her efforts to the contrary, her&#xD;
countenance would lose its animation, and a keen observer&#xD;
could perceive how loosely the visor was worn.&#xD;
One day Drayton called to see her, and instantly discov-.&#xD;
ered that she had been indulging unpleasant feelings, for&#xD;
the impress of gloom was visible on her brow. ~he would&#xD;
talk in an animated strain for a few minutes, when her&#xD;
thoughts would insensibly wander from the subject, and,&#xD;
losing her self-control, she would become unusually silent.&#xD;
Her companion noticed her aberrations of thought, and as-&#xD;
signed them to their proper source, and was glad when an&#xD;
opportunity was afforded him of leaving her to her own re-&#xD;
flections.&#xD;
The truth was, she had not heard from George for a month,&#xD;
and her fears for his welfare had become intense. At times&#xD;
she fancied that absence had chilled his love, or that illness&#xD;
had incapacitated him for writing. A thousand torturing&#xD;
apprehensions followed each other, and only increased the&#xD;
gloom of her heart. "I shall certainly hear from him to-&#xD;
morrow," was the language of her hope at the close of each&#xD;
day; but when the morrow came, and brought with it no&#xD;
tidings of her lover, disappointment would wring the briny&#xD;
tears from her eyes. The day on which Drayton called, she&#xD;
was more than usually oppressed with melancholy forebod-&#xD;
ings, and did not regret that his visit was a short one. When&#xD;
he was gone, she repaired to her chamber, and gave vent to&#xD;
her troubled emotions. Her imagination pictured to her her&#xD;
lover, tar. -away from his home, stretched on a bed of sick-&#xD;
ness, and slowly sinking beyond the reach of human assist-&#xD;
ance; and then followed a train of funereal horrors, conclud-&#xD;
ing'~with a grave in a foreign clime. She trembled and re-&#xD;
-coiled from the frightful scenes her imagination had painted,&#xD;
and, buried her face in her hands and wept. It is thus ever,&#xD;
- when its - object is far away, that love, in woman, will as-&#xD;
sume the character of the adder and sting the bosom which&#xD;
cherishes it. It was at the moment when her grief was&#xD;
most overwhelming that a servant appeared and handed her&#xD;
a. letter. One glance at the superscription assured her it&#xD;
was- -from him of whom she had been indulging so many&#xD;
doubts and anxieties. In an instant the clouds dispersed,&#xD;
and the star of Hope was bright above her-gloom deserted&#xD;
her brow-.-.-the day grew more cheerful to her eye-objects&#xD;

&#xD;
"Once more I address you, my dear Caroline, from -this&#xD;
land of beauty and of strangers. You- will be glad to learn&#xD;
from me that traveling and a benign sky have exerted a&#xD;
-. -- -  miraculous influence over my languid,- dr~opiug system, and&#xD;
that I-begiu to entertain, not only a hope; but a more con-&#xD;
fident feeling, that my health will be restored. M~ spirits&#xD;
are unusually animated. Exercise, instead of wearying me,&#xD;
increases the buoyancy of my feelings. I now take the~same&#xD;
interest I felt many years ago in the glories of earth and&#xD;
sky, for I feel less like a temporary sojourner among those&#xD;
glories. My heart echoes back the gushing song of the bird,&#xD;
and every -breeze that ~aiutes my cheek awakens dreams of&#xD;
- - -     coming delights and love. All these symptoms of approach-&#xD;
ing health I hail with a fullness of joy that appears almost&#xD;
maniacal, because they strengthen me in the belief that I&#xD;
may yet live many years in blessed communion of spirit and&#xD;
of heart with her to whom I am so deeply devoted, and each&#xD;
one crowned with the bliss of her unchanging love.&#xD;
"While you are shrinking from the rigors of a gloomy&#xD;

earth, with itS alternations of hill and vale fading away in&#xD;
the gray distance! Your presence was alone wanting to&#xD;
make the scene and the hour as glorious as a vision of Eden.&#xD;
"You can scarcely conceive of the gorgeousness of the&#xD;
robes of evening in this sunny clime. Night sway~ the scep-&#xD;
ter-of dominion with all the dignity of an empress, and how&#xD;
resplendently is her brow jeweled with stars! The heav-&#xD;
ens wear a. deeper, an intense hue; the stars glow with a&#xD;
richer luster than in our ~wn native northern clime. Even&#xD;
nOw, as I write, I can behold through my casement Orion&#xD;
and his bands shining as magnificently as when ~'they in-&#xD;
spired Job in the olden time. No wonder that the Greeks,&#xD;
in their fair land of song, thought the sky a crystalline vault&#xD;
studded with stars, for it, like that now above ~xne, was&#xD;
transparent, and undimmed by the haze that overspreads our&#xD;
more northern latitudes. The songs of the night-birds and&#xD;
the roar of the sea are now blending together, and rising&#xD;
and floating on the captured air like a blessed anthem to a&#xD;
gracious and beneficent Creator.&#xD;
"And yet I long to be away from this fair clime. I am&#xD;
eager for the coming round of the month in which I shall&#xD;
once more behold familiar scenes and well-remembered faces&#xD;
-...~-when I ~hall again look on my- own bright iiver and its&#xD;
green islands.-when the hands of father and friends shall&#xD;
press mine, and I once more shalt watch the rose-leaf shad-&#xD;
ow on the cheek and the spiritual luster in the eye of the&#xD;
fair being I love. Day by day I weave a fairy web on which&#xD;
are pictures of bliss indescribably dear to me, and call it the&#xD;
future. And shall I indeed realize in the future tho~e starry&#xD;
imaginings- over which the spirit of peace broods with her&#xD;
halcyon wing? Will no unexpected hand dash th~ cup of&#xD;
happiness from my burning lips? - Will there wander no ser-&#xD;
pent among the flowers in the path before me? Often do&#xD;
such questions rise to my mind, when the future spreads it-&#xD;
self out before my dreaming eye without a cloud to shadow&#xD;
its beauty. * One thing I can hot be mistaken in, and that&#xD;
is, so long as the smile of my Caroline is glad for me, the&#xD;
highest hopes that scatter blessings on the crooked pathway&#xD;
of life will be mine. $o long as her love is left me, I can&#xD;

look on all the ills it may be my lot to ~encounter with a&#xD;
steady purpose and an assurance that happiness is not a&#xD;
dream. Possessing that treasure, I fear nothing; without it,&#xD;
what hope, what consolation could my afflicted spirit know?&#xD;
"I am here admonished that I must speedily terminate&#xD;
this message which my heart sends to yours. - The vessel&#xD;
that bears it is ready to depart, and I only have time to as-&#xD;
sure you 'that, present or absent, under all changes, I am de-&#xD;

* *~      Caroline read and reread this letter~  It was inexpressi-&#xD;
bly dear to her, for it removed her anxieties and gloomy&#xD;
forebodings, and assured her of the improving health of her&#xD;
lover. Having satisfied herself of its contents, she took a seat&#xD;
at the table and began a reply to it, with her heart bound..&#xD;
ing with emotions of joy.&#xD;
LETTER PROM CAROLiNE TO GEORGE.&#xD;
"Your letter, my dear George, came safely but slowly to&#xD;
hand, and its contents are all treasured up in my heart.&#xD;
Why was your anxiously-awaited message so long delayed?&#xD;
My spirits had begun to droop and my heart had lost its&#xD;
cheerfulness, for I fancied you were either neglecting me, or&#xD;
declined writing because you could not write what you knew&#xD;
would be pleasing to me. But the spell- that fear had cx-&#xD;
erted over my spirit is 'broken; all my self-torturing appre-&#xD;
hensions are allaye4, and I aTh as happy as a bird in the&#xD;
blushing morn. And oh! George, how shall I give utter-&#xD;
ance to the wildness, the ecstasy of the joy that has suc-&#xD;
ceeded to the gloom that hung over me, eclipsing the bright-&#xD;
nesS of every feeling! Your assurance that your health is&#xD;
improving rapidly is indeed like a glorious sunburst over my&#xD;
dark anticipations. Thanks-fervid and continual thanks&#xD;
to the Ruler of all things that he has not forgotten me, and&#xD;
that it is His- will that you shall again assume your station&#xD;
among men with a firm step and a brow glowing with&#xD;
health. -- Be careful, I beseech you-xisk nothing; for re-&#xD;
member, the happiness of another is inseparable linked with&#xD;
your weEsbeing.&#xD;
"I would that I could climb the dizzy mountain cliffs,&#xD;
survey the heaving ocean, and gaze upon the stars by night&#xD;
with you! Would that I could hang, like one entranced, on&#xD;
your arm, while listening to your fervent-tones~ growing elo-&#xD;

the voice of adulation xxi ~ets my ear, but my heart rejects&#xD;
the tribute because it is s~ poor when compared with what&#xD;
has fallen from your lips. I only hear the words of others,&#xD;
but I always felt yours. The lightest tone from you had a&#xD;
charm incomparablyricher and dearer to me than all the wis-&#xD;
dom and philosophy, gariiished' with eloquence, that others&#xD;
coul&amp;amp; speak. Others are at best but as dim starlight, while&#xD;
you~,n~e as the gladdening sun to my world of bliss. Each&#xD;
hour memory summons you up before me.' As I write, I&#xD;
seem to see your pale brow, around which visions of beauty&#xD;
float like light clouds on the brow of morning--your soul-&#xD;
speaking eye, bright as a star and as blue as the sky which&#xD;
holds it-your mouth, so beautiful and so eloquent, and your*&#xD;

metrical as the Apollo's.&#xD;
"I often recall vanished hours of happiness; they consti-&#xD;

and, fancying you to be my destiny, I would think of no one&#xD;
else. l~1ly love strengthened before the dififeulties that be-&#xD;
set it. I took a melancholy pleasure in retiring froin the ar-&#xD;
tificial brilliance I met with in. societyy , and indulging my&#xD;
genuip.e and uncontrollable fa~ings for you. Your company&#xD;
was a well of undefiled bli~ *liile society without you was&#xD;
a desert and a mockery. I often :nourned in secret, like the&#xD;
turtle wheWjl~)iand of the spoi er has robbed her of her&#xD;
mate. No ~1ieard my sighs. I shrouded the secret of&#xD;
my love in tire sacred stillness of my heart, and there, be-&#xD;
yond the reach of human ken, I nurtured it. Does Fate&#xD;
foreshadow on the spirit the ever .ts which are to make us&#xD;
blessed? Or why did I then dream so fondly of you, when&#xD;
you had not breathed a wish to possess a heart you had al-&#xD;
ready won? And why were. my dreams so like to scenes&#xD;
which so long afterward occurred?&#xD;
"But you were ignorant of what I have here imparted to&#xD;
you, and appeared but as a friend and an admirer. I left&#xD;
my native shores, fearing that the 'love I craved could never&#xD;
be mine. In the classic haunts of the Old World I con-&#xD;
tinued to think of you, and to feel: that my devotion was of&#xD;
that true and living kind over which absence and chatige&#xD;
of scene can not throw' the shado~vs of decay. And when 1&#xD;
returned to my home and again met you, I feared my emo-&#xD;
tions would betray me, and was happy in perceiving that&#xD;
you did not notice them. At length came the hour and the&#xD;
confession, and I gave you my I and and vow, while my&#xD;
heart was happy beyond all imaging.&#xD;
"Why do I take so much delight in writing of former ex-&#xD;
periences to you? -~ The heart of woman is silly, perhaps,&#xD;
when recalling the history of its devotion, and burns to re-&#xD;
veal to the one she loves the dep~h and the strength of her&#xD;
attachment. It is the peculiar provincee of my sex to be&#xD;
miserly in the acknowledgment ('f its affection before, and&#xD;
prodigal after we have heard the love we sigh for confessed.&#xD;
"~i often see your friend, Mr. Drayton. I respect him high-&#xD;
ly, and think his mind very superior to all others I meet with&#xD;
here, now that my "bright particular star" is gilding an-&#xD;

"Mr. Hampton is very dissipated. He never honors me&#xD;

with his company~ I regret deeply that one who possesses&#xD;
such natural advantages should so recklessly abandon him-&#xD;
self to a course which must terminate only in his entire ruin.&#xD;
"I saw your father yesterday. He says he is vexed that&#xD;
you do not write more frequently. Indeed, he would be&#xD;
angry at your remissness, if he were not so exceedingly&#xD;
gentle and so full of the disposition to apologize for the errors&#xD;
of others. His charity is truly Christian, for, while it covers&#xD;
the defects of others, it disposes him to magnify his own.&#xD;
"My sheet is full, and yet my heart is full of what it&#xD;
would communicate to you. The scene around us is wintery&#xD;
and desolate. But the winter will pass away, and the birds&#xD;
and the flowers will grace the returning spring; and then,&#xD;
too, my heart will rejoice and be filled with happiness, for&#xD;
you will then come back to your affectionate and devoted&#xD;
"CAROLINE."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
MARY WINTERS and her mother~, an aged and crone-like&#xD;
woman, were sitting before a blazing fire on a night in the&#xD;
depth of winter~ Mary had cleared away the supper table,&#xD;
and taken her seat near a small workstand. Her face was&#xD;
pale.-.--much paler than when we last parted from her-..-.and,&#xD;
as she leaned over her work, an occasional sigh escaped her.&#xD;
The old woman sat in alow chair near the corner of the&#xD;
wide fire-place, with her face bent toward the- fire, and her&#xD;
elbows on her knees. She was enjoying her pipe, an old ac-&#xD;
quaintance, and apparently watching the wreaths of smoke&#xD;
she emitted as they circled under the arch and passed up&#xD;
the chimney. Her face was deeply marked by age. Her&#xD;
color was very sallow; her ~nose was hooked like the bill of&#xD;
a hawk, and Lher cheek was wrinkled and hollow. She&#xD;
wore a white muslin cap, somewhat dingy, with a - small&#xD;
ruffle in front, tied under her chin. The winds whistled&#xD;
bitterly overhead, and as a blast, which caused the windows&#xD;
to rattle, swept by, she took hold of the end of the long check&#xD;
apron which was tied about her waist, and drew it over-her&#xD;
shoulders, muttering,&#xD;
"It's a bitter cold night, and I pity the poor cattle that's&#xD;
- '~' uihoused and has to stand it."&#xD;
&#xD;
DR4~YTON.                     151&#xD;
Mary, if she heard her mother, paid no attention to what&#xD;
she said, bitt continixed to ply her needle, while the old&#xD;
woman resumed her former position. A few minutes of si-&#xD;
knee, broken only by the howling winds aiid the cracking&#xD;
fire, had passed, when Mrs. Winters took her pipe from her&#xD;
lips, and, turning to Mary, said,&#xD;
"Ye'd better move your work higher the fire, Mary, for&#xD;
*       ye'll ketch cold if ye don't."&#xD;
The daughter did not seem to hear the words addressed&#xD;
to her, aiid the mother cleared her throat, and in a thriller&#xD;
tone said,&#xD;
"it say, Mary, ye'd better come higher the fire."&#xD;
A similar fate attended this effort to arrest the girl's at-&#xD;
tention; and 'she regarded her daughter intently for a mo-&#xD;
ment, when; seeming to lose her patience, she elevated her&#xD;
tone, and voTciferated,&#xD;
"Are ye deaf, or are ye asleep, that ye can't mind what a&#xD;
body says toyou?"&#xD;
Mary started, and, with the look of a person who has been&#xD;
frightened with a dream, hastily said,.&#xD;
"Did you speak to me, mother ?"&#xD;
-          "Speak to you ?" said Mrs. Winters; "to be sure I did, see-&#xD;
ing there's nobody but you to hear, and I'm not in the habit&#xD;
of talking with sperits. I say," she continued, in a softer&#xD;
tone, "ye'd better move your work up this way, higher the&#xD;
fire."&#xD;
"I am warm enough where I am, mother," replied Mary;&#xD;
and, as she spoke, she drooped her head over her work and&#xD;
resumed her sewing, while the old woman drew her chair&#xD;
nearer the fire; and, shivering, muttered,&#xD;
"It's all because I'm getting old so fast that I feel the cold&#xD;
so. It didn't use to he so, fbr I could milk the cows, and&#xD;
my fingers wouldn't even smart ;" an1, sighing, she again&#xD;
placed her elbows on her knee~ and her chin on the palms&#xD;
of her hands, and smoked her pipe resolutely.&#xD;
There was a knock at the door, and the old woman start-&#xD;
ed from her revery and exclaimed,&#xD;
"Merciful heavens! if there ain't somebody at the door&#xD;
this bitter cold night !" and, elevating her voice until it was&#xD;
as shrill and as loud as the winds outside, she screamed,&#xD;
"Come in--come in !"&#xD;
The door was slowly opened, and the form of Roger Brown,&#xD;
muffled up in a* large, coarse overcoat, entered the roon~,&#xD;
With a smile on his face, he courteously- said,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7761-00000077"/>&#xD;
44&#xD;
&#xD;
"Good evening, Mary-~.-good evening, Mrs. Winters; I hope&#xD;
I se~ you well, ma'am."&#xD;
Mary returned his salutation gently, and with a faint smile.&#xD;
lie took a chair, bnd drew it directly in front of the fire.&#xD;
The old woman w~.tched all his movement~ closely, and, when&#xD;
he was seated, inquired,&#xD;
"Why, Roger, arri't you 'most froze ?"&#xD;
"No, I'm very comfortable, ma'amn," he replied. "Don't&#xD;
you see this coat? Well, all the nor'westers that can get at&#xD;
me through it are welcome to bite me as long as they please.&#xD;
By-the-way, ma'am, I've got a present for you ;" and, so say-&#xD;
ing, he placed his hand in his pocket, and drew therefrom a&#xD;
paper containing tobacco, and handed it to the old woman,&#xD;
wh9 took it and thanked him.&#xD;
it "You'Ufiud it a genuinee article," said Roger, as she raised&#xD;
to her nose to in ale the aroma of the weed.&#xD;
The next object that attracted his attention was a large&#xD;
gray eat, the terror of inferior quadrupeds, which rose lazily,&#xD;
stretched herself, and walked with great deliberation toward&#xD;
him. She purrect loudly as slw rubbed her sides against his&#xD;
legs, and he lifted her to his lap, where the animal, appar-&#xD;
ently, well satisfiedwith the eligible lodgings she there fiund,&#xD;
oQiled. herself up, and made every necessary arrangement pre-&#xD;
paratory. to a ria~. Roger amused himself a while by pull-&#xD;
ing the creature's ears and tail, until she,, wisely concluding&#xD;
that if she remained there her slumbers would be disturbed&#xD;
by unpleasant dreams, scratched his hand in revenge, sprang&#xD;
upon the floor, and resumed her former position.&#xD;
The evening Waxed late. Mrs. Winters, having finished&#xD;
her pipe, took up a stocking, and soon began to nod over her&#xD;
needles. ~ The manner in which her head dodged first on&#xD;
one side and then on the other afforded Roger much amuse-&#xD;
ment. At length she slept soundly, and he moved his chair&#xD;
near Mary, and they commenced and carried on a conver-&#xD;
sation in a low, half-whispering tone of voice.&#xD;
"I~IIary, you told me, the last time I spoke to' you about-&#xD;
aboul;.-'.-about our affairs you'd give me an answer in six&#xD;
weeks, and the time's out to-night. Now say when it shall&#xD;
take place."&#xD;
"Oh,-Roger," she replied, in a tremulous tone; while her&#xD;
cheek, which had been pale during the evening, became&#xD;
/ .      flushed, "if you care any thing about my feelings, you will&#xD;
'.npt' 'say any thing 'more on that subject now-if you knew&#xD;
all things you would not do it."&#xD;

She sighed ~deeply-.--.a tear swelled in her eye-and she&#xD;
appeared 'to be troubled by the presence of disagreeable&#xD;
thoughts. An embarrassing silence ensued, which was brok-~&#xD;
en by Roger.&#xD;
"If you knew how much I love you, you wouldn't keep&#xD;
me on uncertainties any longer." -&#xD;
"Indeed," she returned, some ~vhat subdued by his re-&#xD;
mark, "indeed, I can't tell you 'why, but I do not love you&#xD;
as well as a girl ought to love the man she marries. And&#xD;
if I was to marry you under the ~ircnmstan~es, you would&#xD;
not be as happy as you deserve to be, for you are very kind&#xD;
and good."&#xD;
Roger hung his head, and it wts now his turn to drop a.&#xD;
tear. She observed his emotions, and added,&#xD;
"Oh, if you only knew what a wretched, unhappy girl I&#xD;
am, you would rather go to the river and drown yourself&#xD;
than think of marrying me. Go a ad marry some more wor-&#xD;
thy girl, for I am not worthy of y(u-..indeed I am not."&#xD;
"I am not worthy of you," stammered Roger, brushing&#xD;
his coat sleeve -across his eyes, "b it I do love you, and will&#xD;
love you as long ~s I live; and I'm sure there's not another&#xD;
man breathing who would do more 'toward making you&#xD;
happy than I would. Don't talk to me about marrying&#xD;
somebody else, for it will make me crazy if you do."&#xD;
"If you knew me, you would despise rae, for.-." and here&#xD;
her sobs choked her articulation, and her words were not&#xD;
audible to-him.&#xD;
"Are you sick, or what ails you ~ he inquired, with much&#xD;
anxiety, gazing earnestly in her eo'orless face, and trying to&#xD;
read the cause of her emotions.&#xD;
"Yet! oh yes.! I am sick, andj wish in mercy I could&#xD;
die-die--die !"&#xD;
She spoke so earnestly that he was startled. As soon as&#xD;
he recovered his composure, he sad,&#xD;
"It is sinful to talk in that way: you ought to pray to live,&#xD;
that you may be a comfort to your poor widowed mother."&#xD;
"I know it's sinful, but I can't help wishing it. Oh, do&#xD;
not say another word to me abou' marrying! Go to your&#xD;
home, and do not come back to t~ik of love for one -who is&#xD;
so unworthy of you as I am. You make me miserable. Go&#xD;
home-go home.-ai~d When you cOme hero again, come as&#xD;
if nothing had taken place between us ;" - and, having said&#xD;
this, she rose and walked toward the fire, where* she. stood&#xD;
looking intently on the hearth at her feet.&#xD;

&#xD;
Roger glanced at her, and then, placing his arm on the&#xD;
I table, leaned this brow on it, and sighed, and sobbed, and&#xD;
felt himself to be the most miserable of men. At length he&#xD;
rose, took his hat in one hand, and, approaching Mary, ex-&#xD;
tended the other to her without saying a word. He left&#xD;
the house in great mental perturbation', scarcely knowing&#xD;
where he was or what he did. When he reached the road&#xD;
he pulled off his hat, and, while the cold winds fanned his&#xD;
burning brow, he stood looking up at the bright, unpitying&#xD;
moon with the wild and vacant stare of a maniac.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
THE next day found Mary Winters in the city, whither&#xD;
she went, as she stated, to visit some relatives. The glad&#xD;
and joyous girl had suddenly changed her demeanor; instead&#xD;
of the exhilarating and wild laugh, and eye flashing with&#xD;
light, her face was shrouded with melancholy, and she was&#xD;
generally much abstracted, and at times sullen. These&#xD;
changes were noticed by her friends, who frequently tried to&#xD;
revive her spirits and rekindle her former animation. Some-&#xD;
times her gay outbreaks of humor reminded them of her&#xD;
former buoyancy; but-these were only fits, and. were always&#xD;
followed by spells of the most cheerless gloom. It was ev-&#xD;
ident to all who noticed her that something preyed upon her&#xD;
heart-that the worm had blighted her bloom-but what&#xD;
it was was beyond the reach of their anxious inquiries.&#xD;
Her mother, on several occasions, detected tears in her&#xD;
eyes, and sought in vain to discover the cause. She was&#xD;
assured it was only a passing cl&amp;amp;ud of sorrow. And then&#xD;
Mary'~ frequent fits of abstraction gave the old woman great&#xD;
uneasiness, who was at a loss to assign any adequate cause&#xD;
for so total a change in the conduct of her daughter, who,&#xD;
until hen, 'appeared to be one of the happiest of beings.&#xD;
For a day or two after her arrival in town Mary walked&#xD;
out alone frequently, and on each occasion returned with&#xD;
an expression of disappointment shading her features. One&#xD;
evening she sat at the window looking out on the crowds&#xD;
of strangers passing by. Her brow was more than usually&#xD;
melancholy.. Suddenlyher eye kindled, and, starting up, she&#xD;
&#xD;
L&#xD;
N&#xD;
~Iji&#xD;
&#xD;
hastily put on her bonnet, and drew her shawl over her shouk&#xD;
ders, and went forth with a quick step. At the distance ~f&#xD;
half a square'from her she saw a well-known form, that had&#xD;
passed the window from which she had been looking a few&#xD;
moments before. Her step was nervous, and her bosom&#xD;
much agitated, ~and she passed on hastily, observing no one&#xD;
but the person in 'advance of her. She had been following&#xD;
him a considerable distance, when he halted, looked round,&#xD;
and entered a door. In the next minute she stood in front&#xD;
of it, read the sign, and then, with a palpitating heart, rapped&#xD;
gently. A voice to which she had often listened shouted&#xD;
"Come in," and she opened the door and entered the room.&#xD;
The office in which she now for the first time 'stood was&#xD;
well' furnished with tables, chairs, and book-cases. A fire&#xD;
was blazing on The hearth, and stretched at full length be-&#xD;
fore it, on a sofa, was the individual for whom she had been&#xD;
anxiously looking since her arrival in town. He sprang up,&#xD;
and, approaching her, in a tone of surprise said,&#xD;
"Ah! Mary, is it you'; quite an unexpected honor, I can&#xD;
assure you.~~&#xD;
The poor girl was so much agitated that she could not ut-&#xD;
ter a word, and sank down into the corner of the sofa. He&#xD;
took a seat by~ her side. She kept her gaze riveted on the&#xD;
floor for a minute, when, as if suddenly remembering the ob-&#xD;
ject of her visit, she raised her head, and with a faint smile&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"Oh, Mr. Hampton, I have almost been dying to see you,&#xD;
and was afraid I should not succeed; for here, where there&#xD;
are so many persons thronging the streets, the eye of love can&#xD;
hardly see the one it longs for."&#xD;
There was a beam of affection in her eye and a tone of&#xD;
kindness, in her voice as she spoke. ' After musing a mon~ent,&#xD;
he asked, "H~r did you find me out at last ?"&#xD;
"I watched jthe street until I saw you pass, and then fol-&#xD;
lowed you," was her answer;&#xD;
"I am glad to see you, Mary," he said, laying his hand&#xD;
on hers, and glancing at her face.&#xD;
"Oh! I feared so much you would not be glad to see&#xD;
me," she said, in a tone that was both soft and earnest,&#xD;
"for I really began to think you had forgotten me. I have&#xD;
not seen you for a month. How could you be so cruel as to&#xD;
neglect me for so long a time? My every thought is wrap-&#xD;

wrath of Heaven to convince you hoW much I loved you;&#xD;
and yet you are so cruel, after all, as to neglect me ;" and,&#xD;
as she concluded, a tear glistened in her eye.&#xD;
"Ali! but it was you who were cruel," he said, in a tone&#xD;
which was meant for kindness. "How could you suspect me&#xD;
of forgetting you? I could as soon forget there was a sun&#xD;
in heaven as that bright eye, Mary."&#xD;
'"Why, then, did you not come to see inc ?" she said;&#xD;
"~Vhy did you leave me to feed on my own dark thougliWt&#xD;
w~iy did you not come to tell me over and over again tlii~.t~&#xD;

There was much -energy and passion in her voice, and her&#xD;
Ibrw~ shook convulsively as she spoke. He felt the justice&#xD;
~ot~the~condemnation implied in her words, and tried to apol..&#xD;
o~ze for his conduct. Turning his basilisk eye on her, he&#xD;
said1 tenderly,&#xD;
"I-I wouldn't neglect so fair a flower for the world. The&#xD;
fact i~, I have had so much business for the Iast~month at&#xD;
t4~e ciurt-house that I could not leave town. If it had not&#xD;
b~een for. such engagements, I would have seen you often."&#xD;
What he said was false, for he was a briefless lawyer.&#xD;
H~jng accomplished hi~ purpose, he had deserted her inten-&#xD;
ti~nally. The present scene was very unpleasant to him,&#xD;
aWd h~ was willing to give any explanations or promises&#xD;
which might bring it to a termination.&#xD;
~ why did you not write to me ?" said Mary, pas-&#xD;
sionately. "A letter from you would have saved me so many&#xD;
tears !"&#xD;
"I wrote to you two weeks ago, ~.nd sent it by Roger, who&#xD;
lives at Colonel Meredith's," he. replied, coining a lie for the&#xD;
occasion.&#xD;
"I thought Roger hated you too much to speak to you,"&#xD;
she returned, revolving the improbability of what he said.&#xD;
"If he did not hand you my note, Mary, it was because&#xD;
he is jealous of me."&#xD;
"Do you tell me the truth ?" she inquired, with a. flash-&#xD;
ing eye, starting from him.&#xD;
lb winced under the scrutiny of the look she gave him,&#xD;
but, with his accustomed boldness, replied,&#xD;
"Do not, I beseech you, question my veracity. I'll swear&#xD;
I would not for the world lie to one as fair and as much&#xD;
loved as you are, ~[ary."&#xD;
He was exceedingly anxious t~ ~hauge the subject, for he&#xD;
felt that if it was not ai~ested he would involve himself too&#xD;
&#xD;
deeply for extrication. IJe passed his arm around hor~waist&#xD;
and made au effort to kiss her; whicii~he repulsed. Break-&#xD;
ing from his embrace, she asked, in a loud tone,&#xD;
"And would you dare to deceive me ?"&#xD;
"I would not, upon my honor," he replied.&#xD;
She looked at him intently for a minute, while she ~tried&#xD;
to collect her scattered thoughts. At length, with grea1~&#xD;
earnestness, she said,&#xD;
"Cit would be better that you were in' your grave than&#xD;
liv~ig and here lying. to my face. I gave you my heart be&#xD;
cause you told me I had yours. You~promised-you swore&#xD;
by high heaven and every star in the sky, time and again,&#xD;
that you loved me, and would marry me, if I only--only-&#xD;
only-.." and her voice faltered, and, overcome byirer emo-&#xD;
tion, she could not articulate her thoughts.&#xD;
"Here's the devil to pay," thought Hampton, as he turned&#xD;
and twisted about in his seat. "Mary," he said, with ap-&#xD;
parent sincerity, "why do you doubt tb~ J mean to ft4fill,&#xD;
every promise I ever made you? Do not, my &amp;amp;ea~gfrik&#xD;
chide me with being treacherous to you until I d~a~erv~eit~"&#xD;
"When will you fulfill your promise ?" .inquired Mai~yiu&#xD;
a gentler tone, while her credulous heart, told her that ~he&#xD;
had accused him wrongfully. "When shall I be your wife~?&#xD;
when will yon take away all my fears and sorrows?: Yon&#xD;
see how pale and altered I am! Well, it is all on yeur ac-&#xD;
count. When-tell me when you will redeem your vow, and&#xD;
marry me&#xD;
"In the spring, when the birds are singing and the bees&#xD;
are sipping honey fr0m the flowers," he replied, willing to&#xD;
promise any thing which might allay her excitement and en&amp;amp; ~&#xD;
the scene.&#xD;
"In the spring-in the spring !" she said, as if musing.&#xD;
"Oh! that will be too late. I can not livb1so long as I have&#xD;
lived. My heart w41 fret itself out of my body. Let it be&#xD;
now-now-now," she added, passiQnately, "if you would&#xD;
save me from death; forihow can I live with shame and ~re-&#xD;
morse gnawing continually at my heart? No," she added,&#xD;
rising and elevating her right arm, "I can not live with&#xD;
shame and dishonor pressing on me like a mountain; and I&#xD;
vow,~by all that is true in a woman's soul, u*1;o live and&#xD;
feel like a guilty wretch much longer."&#xD;
"Be composed, my dear Mary," he said, entreatingly,&#xD;
rising and grasping her uplifted arm. "Be composed. The&#xD;

Do you si~ppose me to be villain enough to ~win your love and&#xD;
confidence only to betray' you?"&#xD;
"I have sometimes feared so," she replied~ turning her&#xD;
head aside to hide~tiie expression of her face from his eye.&#xD;
"Think so no~t~re, then, &amp;amp;~re~t," he added.in a tone of&#xD;
so much gentleu~ss and kindness that sl~, could not resist&#xD;
the conviction .that he spoke sincerely, "I~uit~believe me to&#xD;
be an honorableA man, for I do not mean to deceive ydu.&#xD;
Will you-do you believe me ?"&#xD;
"I do believe you," she whispered, as he drew her to his&#xD;
bosom, "for my heart could not be so untrue to me as to love&#xD;
a villain as I love you."&#xD;
He kissed her and caressed her, but she heeded him. not,&#xD;
for her eye and her thoughts wandered. ~Swldenly she&#xD;
started as from a slumber, 'and, looking wildly at him, ~x-&#xD;
claimed,&#xD;
"If you mean to deceive me, oh tell me so, for I can not&#xD;
bear the lingering torture I have felt for several weeks any&#xD;
longer. Let me know the worst, and if death is to be my&#xD;
doom, let it come soon/s&#xD;
"Death! talk not of death now. We will live and enjoy&#xD;
our love for many long years."&#xD;
Hampton found some difficulty in sustaining~ the part he&#xD;
had assumed. He thought that by soothing her she would&#xD;
soon leave, and tWe interview he disliked so much would be&#xD;
ended. He resorted to kindness of manner the' further to de-&#xD;
cej~ve the poor' girl, whose only sin consisted in~ loving him&#xD;
~too passionately.&#xD;
* "Oh!' how happy I will be as your wife !" said the art-&#xD;
less, half doubting, half' believing girl; "and I will do eVery~&#xD;
thing in my power to make you as happy as myself."&#xD;
Qh yes, whenwe are married, the days will be all sun-&#xD;
shine !" he said; "and then how you will regret that you&#xD;
ever for a moment thought me 'base e~ii~gh 'to win your love&#xD;
and then desert you. But come, 3VLary," he added, desirous&#xD;
of terminating the scene at this' favorable juncture, "come,&#xD;
it is growing late, and some gentlemen may be dropping in,&#xD;
and, s~,ein u. here, would suspect you."&#xD;
She ros, 4, accompanied by Hampton, passed into the&#xD;
'street. When they reached the h9use of her relative, he left&#xD;
her, promising to vi~it her at her own ~home in 'a few days.&#xD;
As soon as supper was over, Mary complained of illness,&#xD;
and repaired to her chamber, to recall all that had passed&#xD;

&#xD;
during h~r interview with Hampton. Many were her pleas-&#xD;
ant thoughts and bright hopes; but her 'heart at times mis-&#xD;
gave her, ii~i~, as a doubt of his sincerity oppressed her feel-&#xD;
ings, they became intensely bitter, and the hot tears gathered&#xD;
in her eyes. Between ~rniles and ~tea', rief and joy, like&#xD;
a cloud that is bright to~' but dt~z~to the shade, she&#xD;
spent an nnrefr~hing night, and rose early next morning&#xD;
and made preparations for returning home.&#xD;
When Hampton left her, he reflected on what had oc-&#xD;
curred, and cui~d his fate and the unlucky accidents which&#xD;
had involved liini so inextricably. What to do was the per-&#xD;
plexing question. As to fulfilling his vow and becoming&#xD;
Mary's husband, that, of course, he laughed at as a first-rate&#xD;
joise~ But how should he manage matters so as to clear&#xD;
himself of,~hat he considered the most embarrassing occur-&#xD;
re~ice of his life? He had, in this instance, woven so tangled&#xD;
a, web, that extrication, even with all his adroitness, seemed&#xD;
impossible. With many thoughts harassing him; he passed&#xD;
into the bar-room of a tavern, where he was accosted by&#xD;
tWo of his friends, with whom he spent the evening. He&#xD;
~d~rank deeply, played heedlessly, and betrayed a degree of&#xD;
recklessness unusual even with him. Thus differently pass-&#xD;
ed the,~night with poor Mary Winters, to whom love was an&#xD;
only hope, aiid the base wretch to whom her love was a&#xD;
matter of the most perfect indifference.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
WHENEVEIL a vain man fails in any of' his undertakings,&#xD;
instead of ascribing his failure to a want of the proper 'ability&#xD;
in himself, he attributes it to some foreign influence over&#xD;
which he has no control. Hampton had loved Ellen Mere-&#xD;
dith as much as such a person could love a pure-hearted&#xD;
woman, and, in endeavoring to account for his failing to win&#xD;
her hand, he had, among other causes, ascri It'to some&#xD;
unintelligible influence on the part of Drayt 7' This sus-&#xD;
picion immediately became the parent of a strong prejudice,&#xD;
and his jealousy only awaited an occasion to display, itself.&#xD;
One night, in the society to which they both belonged, Dray-&#xD;
ton mo~st efl~etually demolished an argumentt which Hamp-&#xD;

&#xD;
ton had urged, whereiiI~on Hampton rose and' made a most&#xD;
malignant personal reply, which Drayton treated with scotn.&#xD;
i~ampton's feelings henceforthwere very bitter, and he never&#xD;
suffered an opportunity of secretly maligning Drayton's char-&#xD;
acter to pass without availing himself of it. ])rayton~ had&#xD;
heard of Hampton~ clandestine efforts to injure his standing,&#xD;
and treated them with the contempt they4eserved. When&#xD;
Hampton first became acquainted with him, Drayton gave&#xD;
him an' outline of' his' career, and Hampton frequently en-&#xD;
deavored' to prejudice others against him by representing&#xD;
him as a plebeian wretch who, having forsaken the imple-&#xD;
ments of a cobbler, had come among strangers to practice&#xD;
imposition on the unwary.&#xD;
Notwithstanding his secret malice, Hampton still con-&#xD;
tinued to call at Drayton~s office, and, when there, 'he fre-&#xD;
quently disgusted him by narrating his successes with women,&#xD;
who, from his representations, had not the power to resist&#xD;
the influence of his fascinations. After ftequcnt irritations&#xD;
of this sort, Drayton one day told him that it was base and&#xD;
ungentlemanly in him to brag of such things, and intimated&#xD;
a suspicion that he was a slanderer of much better reputa-&#xD;
tions than his own. A rupture took place between them,&#xD;
which, much to Drayton~s pleasure, lasted' for a month, when&#xD;
Jiampton again forced himself on his notice.&#xD;
Mrs. Willoughby has already been represented a~ a wom-&#xD;
an of the world and a leader in the empire of fashion. To&#xD;
this position she never could have aspired had she not been&#xD;
possessed of wealth. She was one of those female Lycur-&#xD;
~ guses who issue their haughty mandates and think all oth-&#xD;
ers bound to obey them. Some followed her example and&#xD;
obeyed her commands ; ~but there were many among the&#xD;
older families in the city who scorned Mrs. Willoughby's vul-&#xD;
garity, and over these she exerted no influence, though she&#xD;
had wooed them on all occasions in her most affable man-&#xD;
ner. Hampton was on the best terms with the Willough-&#xD;
bys'; and, indeed, he was so far a favorite with Maria as to&#xD;
be one of the dozen persons to whom the coquettish girl had&#xD;
engaged herself, in order that the length of her train of ad-&#xD;
mirers mig~ be incomparable, and that when she needed a&#xD;
gallant she might lie sure of one sufficiently obsequious for&#xD;
her purposes.&#xD;
Shortly after his falling out with Drayton, Hampton sought&#xD;
and found an opportunity of communicating to the Willough-&#xD;
bys the fact that Drayton had once labored in ar~ luunble&#xD;

&#xD;
vocation, aud accompanied his comz~~iicatiou with sundry&#xD;
slanderous insinuations. To Mrs. Wliloughby the idea of&#xD;
taking the hand Qf a person who had once been familiar with&#xD;
shoemaking was utterly horrible. indeed, ~o aristocratfe&#xD;
and exquisite were her perceptions, that she vowed she could&#xD;
snuff a mechanic in the breeze if the rascally plebeian were&#xD;
within a quarter of a mile. Her felicitously-endowed nose,&#xD;
however, had failed to detect the taint about Drayton; but&#xD;
when once apprised of the facts touching his early history,&#xD;
she protested she had always entertained a lurking suspicion&#xD;
that he was not what he pretended~to be. Her sagacity in&#xD;
detecting the evidences of a fact, after the knowledge of it&#xD;
was familiar to her, was truly remarkable. To strengthen&#xD;
the credibility of a slander by innuendoes Was a favorite oc-&#xD;
cupation of hers, and she manifested more adroitness in&#xD;
magnifying and darkening a doubt of another's pretensions&#xD;
than any other expert calumniator in town. If there is one&#xD;
class of beings more than all others jealous of unfounded&#xD;
pretensions, it consists of those who, are cOnsCiouS that they&#xD;
hold positions to which, according to the canons of aristoc-&#xD;
racy, they have no right. Hence it was that Mrs. Willough-&#xD;
by was so extremely fearful lest she might sanction unfound-&#xD;
ed pretensions; She belonged to that singularly amiable&#xD;
class of persons who, having by good luck ascended to emi-&#xD;
nences, kindly kick down the ladder by which they climb&#xD;
up, lest the rarefied and pure atmosphere of the' higher lat-&#xD;
itudes should be infected by vulgar breath.&#xD;
Toward the end of winter Mrs. Willoughby determined to&#xD;
give another party, the brilliance of which should far sur-&#xD;
pass that of any during the season. She was sitting with&#xD;
her amiable daughter one morning, engaged in making out&#xD;
a list of those who were to be invited. The young lady&#xD;
was about writing the name of IDrayton, when the mother&#xD;
observed,&#xD;
"He shall not be invited."&#xD;
"Why, ma, what is the reason you will not have him in-&#xD;
vited ?" inquired Maria, looking up with an expression of&#xD;
the most decided astonishment.&#xD;
"I want no wax-ends and lasts about me," was the gen-&#xD;
tle reply; "for if there's any one thing I do most cordially&#xD;
hate, it is a shoemaker ;" and as the patrician Mrs. Wil-&#xD;
lougliby concluded, her snub nose became aspiring, and sud-&#xD;
denly turned up with an expression of unmitigated dis-&#xD;
tlain.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7761-00000082"/>&#xD;
162           DRAYTON.                                         DRAYTON.           163&#xD;
&#xD;
~C His family is good," said Maria, who, having conceived&#xD;
a fondness for Drayton, was loth to sacrifice him; "and I&#xD;
have been told that he was forced to make: shoes when he&#xD;
was young because his father's circumstances were so much&#xD;
- reduced that he could not afford to suppoit:his large fam-&#xD;
ily. i've always heard that the Draytons~ used to be the&#xD;
most respectable persons about here."&#xD;
"It's nothing to me what people's grandfathers were,"&#xD;
retorted Mrs. Willoughby, as some unsavory.recollections of&#xD;
what her own ancestry a been came up before her. "I&#xD;
only look at what they themselves are, aid .~[ am not going&#xD;
to patronize any impostors, who, having been shoemakers,&#xD;
try to pass current in society as gentlemen."~&#xD;
"But, my dear ma, the Merediths, and the Russells, and&#xD;
the Butlers all receive his visits, and I don't see why we&#xD;
shouldn't invite him, for, whatever he was once, he is now&#xD;
as good as any body else."&#xD;
"For Heaven's sake, Maria, don't be holding up these peo-&#xD;
ple to me as patterns, for you know I follow nobody's opin-&#xD;
ions but my own. They may let, every dirty mechanic in&#xD;
town come to their houses if they please, but I am resolved&#xD;
on keeping my company select."&#xD;
The decided~ manner in which this was spoken, together&#xD;
with the singiAarly uncompromising toes of the head which&#xD;
accompanied it, assured Maria that the doom of her favor-&#xD;
ite Drayton was written. Nevertheless, she ventured to&#xD;
urge, in a ~subdued tone, her objections to the rule her moth-&#xD;
er appeared to be attached to.&#xD;
"If you are going to be exclusive, you will have a very&#xD;
small party, for there are not ten persons in town who have&#xD;
not some objection founded on their families or their occu-&#xD;
pations; and, indeed, I myself would be unfit for so select a&#xD;
gathering, as it has not been quite a thousaj~id years since&#xD;
some of my beloved ancestors might have been seen, under&#xD;
the most suspicious circumstances, prowling about little huts&#xD;
in the skirts of the town. You th4nk there is nobody better&#xD;
thaii Susan Roberts, and her father, you know, was nothing&#xD;
but a shoemaker. Are you going to cut her too ?"&#xD;
"But she never made shoes, and she can't help what her&#xD;
father once did," replied Mrs. Willoughby, unable to meet&#xD;
her daughter's arguments fairly.&#xD;
"Mr. Drayton is a gentleman of fine mind, and I will stick&#xD;
up for him," said Miss Willoughby, with considerable per-&#xD;
tinacity. "His blood is excellent, and as every body else&#xD;
&#xD;
N&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
thinks him good enough to associate with, I don't see why&#xD;
we should exclude him."&#xD;
"Now, Maria, you need not say another word in his fa-&#xD;
vor, for he shall not come to my house, and that's flat," said&#xD;
the elder lady, with the most intractable decision of pur-&#xD;
pose. "Why, what in the name of common sense has got&#xD;
into the girl? Do you want to have all the trasb~ in town&#xD;
invited to meet you, simply because they happen, by some in-&#xD;
scrutable dispensation of Providence, to have a little brains ?"&#xD;
The young lady's cheek reddened, her lip quivered with&#xD;
rage, her little foot swung to and fro violently, and, fling-&#xD;
ing the list of names from her hand, she exclaimed, in an&#xD;
angry tone,&#xD;
"Well, if he is not to be invited, I vow I won't have any&#xD;
thing to do with the party."&#xD;
"Why, you must have taken leave of your seveti senses,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Willoughby, contemplating her enraged daughter&#xD;
with a look of great surprise. She hesitated a moment, for&#xD;
the young lady was humming a tune, as if she was decided-&#xD;
ly opposed to listening to another word. The singing ceased,&#xD;
and the mother continued: "I met that Drayton the other&#xD;
night at Mrs. Russell's, and he passed me three times, and&#xD;
did not even deign to speak to me. And, after that, do you&#xD;
think I'll invite such a brute to my house.? No; I wish I&#xD;
may be struck dumb if I do."&#xD;
The principal reason for her unwillingness to have Dray-&#xD;
ton invited was now out. She was jealous of the attentions&#xD;
of others; and if one was unfortunate enough to neglect her,&#xD;
she was thenceforth unforgiving. Maria's face relaxed its&#xD;
expression slightly as she listened to her mother, and when&#xD;
she had concluded, she said,&#xD;
"He 'certainly did not see you, for he is too much of a&#xD;
gentleman to pass you without giving you some token of his&#xD;
respect for you."&#xD;
"He did bow coldly," said Mrs. Willoughby; "'but he&#xD;
never does treat me with any attention, and I am resolved&#xD;
on cutting him. Mr. H4mpton told me that he heard him&#xD;
ridiculing me, and after that I would not condescend to speak&#xD;
to him to save his neck."&#xD;
"I do not believe what Mr. Hampton says," said Maria,&#xD;
"for he is very jealous of Mr. Drayton, and says every thing&#xD;
he can invent against him. He has told me a thousand&amp;amp;&#xD;
things to Mr. Drayton's disadvantage, but I never paid the&#xD;
slightest regard to them.~~&#xD;

&#xD;
At this moment the bell rang, and a servant announced&#xD;
Mr. Hampton.&#xD;
"1 have a great ~nind to send him word I don't want to&#xD;
see ~irn," said Maria, musing;' "but he has got a ring of&#xD;
mine, which I must get from him before I give him his&#xD;
walking papers. I never was so tired of any 'body's perse-&#xD;
cutions in my life, and I mean to affront him and free my-&#xD;
self of him forever."&#xD;
In no amiable mood, Miss Willoughby rose, glanced into&#xD;
a mirror, and then proceeded' to the parlor, where the first&#xD;
thing which met her obser~ration was the symmetrical form&#xD;
of Hampton stretched Qut most luxuriously on the sofa. She&#xD;
stopped and looked at him with amazement. His flushed&#xD;
face proved that he had been drinking. He ~miled and&#xD;
sprang up, and, approaching her, seized her hand and raised&#xD;
it to his lips.' She jerked it impulsively from his grasp, and&#xD;
drew her handkerchief across the back of it, as if she wished&#xD;
to remove the affectionate impress from it. She regarded&#xD;
him angrily for a moment, and said,&#xD;
"You are the most impudent man in the world; you cer-&#xD;
tainly must be drunk !"&#xD;
He returned her searching glance, and then laughed out..&#xD;
right. As he was in the act of resuming his seat, he said,&#xD;
"You are growing marvelously prudish all at once; how&#xD;
is your health, lady fair ?"&#xD;
Mr, Hampton," she said, with unusual dignity, "you&#xD;
will please henceforth to remember that I strictly forbid you&#xD;
to take any such liberties with my hand. If you ever at-&#xD;
tempt to press it-i-to defile it by pressing it against your lips,&#xD;
as I live, I will insult you."&#xD;
"Whew! what a robbery I've innocently kicked up !" he&#xD;
exclaimed. "'Why, fairest of your sex," he added, gently,&#xD;
the hand belongs to me according to engagement, and that&#xD;
entitles one to the privilege of kissing it when one pleases."&#xD;
"If that be the case, si~r," she returned, calmly but coldly,&#xD;
I will guard myself against' any, thing so extremely dis-&#xD;
agreeable hereafter, by revoking what you absurdly call the&#xD;
engagement on the spot."&#xD;
There was a decision in her tones which he by no means&#xD;
relished, and, rising, )~ took a chair, and seated himself&#xD;
near her. Leaning 'forward,~he inclined his face very near&#xD;
her own, and, with a serious expression of countenance, said,&#xD;
in a low and earnest tone,&#xD;
"I am exceedingly sorry if I have offended you. Forgive&#xD;
&#xD;
me, if you please; I can n~t bear to see that brilliant fore-&#xD;
head clouded. Believe me, it was the strength of the love&#xD;
I feel for you that.-~-"&#xD;
"Keep your love, to yourself, sir, or give it to those who&#xD;
wish it," she said, interrupting him, and at the same time&#xD;
moving her chair further from him. He looked amazed,&#xD;
and, as she reseated herself, she added, "I will thank you,&#xD;
sir, to keep at a respectful distance. You have been bru-&#xD;
talizing yourself by drinking, and your breath is extremely&#xD;
offensive to' me."&#xD;
"I met a friend," said Hampton, in an apologetic tone,&#xD;
at the same time coloring deeply, for her remark cut him&#xD;
severely, "one whom I had not seen for a long time, and&#xD;
he insisted on my drinking a bottle of wine with him,&#xD;
and I..-"&#xD;
"And I wish his company had been sufficiently agreeable&#xD;
to detain you," she said, again interrupting him.&#xD;
"Forgive me," he said, earnestly, for he was anxious to&#xD;
conciliate the, offended beauty; "forgive me, Maria, and I&#xD;
will promise not to repeat my offense in future."&#xD;
As he spoke he rose, and a second time placed his 'chair&#xD;
near hers, whereupon she left the one in which she had been&#xD;
sitting and took a seat on the sofa, saying, as she did so,&#xD;
"I ask you for no excuses; you can get drunk twenty&#xD;
times a day for aught I care. I do not know why you should&#xD;
choose to make your confessions to me.' You are nothing to&#xD;
me, sir."&#xD;
"Nothingto you, l~Iaria Willoughby !"'he exclaimed, start-&#xD;
ing up as if her words':were daggers to him. "Nothing to&#xD;
you, did you say ?" he continued, more passionately. "Oh,&#xD;
how strangely such words sound in my ear, coming as they&#xD;
do from lips heretofore ever kind and musical to me. Noth-&#xD;
ing to you, who have professed that I was every thing to&#xD;
you ?" Here he~ resumed his seat, and, fixing his look in-&#xD;
tently on the carpet at his feet, continued muttering the&#xD;
words, "' Nothing to you-~-..nothiug to you !"&#xD;
"You will certainly attain to great proficiency ix~ the pro-&#xD;
nunciation of those interesting words after a while," she&#xD;
said, sarcastically. "Yes, sir," ~he continued, her cheek red-&#xD;
dening as she spoke, "if the words are so agreeable, I will&#xD;
delight you by repeating them e~hatically: You-are----&#xD;
nothing, absolutely uothingto-.ine. 'I pity your case most&#xD;

&#xD;
lenience to me. I hope you will experience no difficulty in&#xD;
understanding me now."&#xD;
"Maria Willoughby !" he said, in a tone of surprise, look-&#xD;
ing sternly i~ her eye, "did you not before high~heaven en-&#xD;
gage yourself to me? You will not certainly be guilty of&#xD;
the black perjury to deny it !"&#xD;
"Oh no, sir, nothing can be further from my heart at&#xD;
this moment than the wish to deny it," she remarked, in a&#xD;
tone of levity. "I confess, sir, to the sin of having engaged&#xD;
myself, as you call it, to you; but it does not follow, in ac-&#xD;
cordance with any logic current in the fashionable world&#xD;
with which I am acquainted, that on that account I am to&#xD;
perpetuate the engagement forever. Why, sir, I have al-&#xD;
ways understood that, after a pipe~stem or a heart, there was&#xD;
nothing so brittle as an engagement, and I have but little&#xD;
doubt that your opinions on that subject will henceforth agree&#xD;
with my own precisely."&#xD;
As she ck)sed her remarks she laughed heartily, whether&#xD;
at her own thoughts or at her lover's face, he could not tell;&#xD;
but certain it is, she laughed as if a most humorous scene&#xD;
were before her. Far different was hi~ mood, for, with a&#xD;
countenance of the most unsmiling kind, he said, when his&#xD;
astonishment had partly subsided,&#xD;
"I pray you, Maria, to retract what you have said, if you&#xD;
would not drive' me to despair. Forgive me the impropriety&#xD;
of my conduct this morning, and take back the words which&#xD;
are worse than daggers to me. I can' not live with the scorn&#xD;
of the* only woman I ever loved, truly and devotedly, on my&#xD;
brow, withering as the curse of Cain."&#xD;
There was much energy in his tone and gesticulation as&#xD;
he spoke, but The lady was callous, and, in return for his se-&#xD;
riousness, said, laughingly but very sarcastically,&#xD;
"Do you mean to plant one of those ugly daggers of which&#xD;
you speak so pathetically in your wretched heart? or will&#xD;
you not rather go off more poetically, and drown your sor-&#xD;
rows in the foaming bowl? I fancy ,the latter more to your&#xD;
taste. But let me 'en~eat you, sir," she continued, while he&#xD;
was writhing visibly' 1~4er her severe raillery, "let me en-&#xD;
treat you, sir, to reconsider that rash resolution of- yours. In&#xD;
the event of i~ts b0e~in fatal, the community wou4d never&#xD;
recover from so br4 a less, and the female portion of&#xD;
it would inevitably go ad, 'as w~.s. ~the case when. Moham-&#xD;

"I desire 'you, as a particular. favor to me-to one, Ma-&#xD;
&#xD;
na, who adores you-.-to forget this morning's proceedings.&#xD;
I have," he continued, approaching her, "I have already&#xD;
suffered sufficiently to atone for my sins of this day. It was&#xD;
wrong, very wrong in me to come here, excited as I was,&#xD;
this morning. What a fool a little wine can make a~&#xD;
man!"&#xD;
"That is the -first sensible remark I have heard from you&#xD;
to-day," she said; "and I am glad to see you are returning&#xD;
to your senses. I hop~--sincerely hope, that now you have&#xD;
discovered yourself to be a fool, you will set about becoming&#xD;
rational."&#xD;
While she was speaking, Hampton approached still nearer&#xD;
to her, and she sprang up 'and said, in a most unequivocal&#xD;
manner,&#xD;
"If you come so near to me again, I will leave you in&#xD;
sole possession here. If you can not avoid being excessively&#xD;
disagreeable, I shall be compelled to request you to leave me&#xD;
to myself."&#xD;
He drew back, his bosom heaved with passion, and, knit-&#xD;
ting his brows, he said, angrily,&#xD;
"You are a no-hearted coquette, and the only regret I&#xD;
feel is, that I should have been so great a fool as to put it in&#xD;
your power to wound my vanity. I have now sufficient&#xD;
proof of your entire heartlessness, and I scorn-I hate you&#xD;
for it."&#xD;
"Now you speak like a man," she said, gayly, "and you&#xD;
utter the only 'feelings I can reciprocate with you. And&#xD;
now, sir," she continued, and her eye flashed with anger as&#xD;
she spoke, "if you ;will be so good as to return me the ring&#xD;
which you took from my finger, and leave me to my reflec-&#xD;
tions, I shall be under a lasting obligation to you."&#xD;
"Excuse me, my lady, if you please," he said, with a sar-&#xD;
donic smile; "I must keep this trophy ;"' and here he glanced&#xD;
at the ring which spar1ded~on his finger. "I wish to place&#xD;
it among several slight tokens of affections that once were,&#xD;
that I have hoarded up with a miserly care. There is no&#xD;
telling what turn my fate may take some of these days, and&#xD;
it may be that I shall have occasion ~to set up a jeweler's&#xD;
shop; in vrhich event, this evidence of Maria Willoughby's&#xD;
affection may satire me from starvation."&#xD;
"There will be no danger of tarving,~ir, so long ~s&#xD;
state prisons exi~t,"- returned. the ~, feeling greatly vexed&#xD;
at his retaining the ring and the manner in which he spoke&#xD;
of it. "Give ni~ that ring, sir !" s~he exclaimed,' in a loud&#xD;

~ ~ssionate voice. "Give me my ring, and leave this&#xD;

"W~iew.---what~a tempest in a tea-pot! Roar on, if you&#xD;

Her anger was excessive, and, looking fiercely at him with&#xD;
a darkened brow, she vociferated,&#xD;
'"You are the most impudent wretch I ever heard of; and&#xD;
if you were not as cowardly as you are impudent, youwould&#xD;
not be so mean as to throw your taunts in the face of a de-&#xD;

"How pretty yoix look in a pet !" he said, looking up at&#xD;
her with~ a~. smile. "If you ever sit for your portrait, take&#xD;
my advice, and get angry with the painter. Reynolds paint-&#xD;
ed Garrick between comedy and tragedy; aud, if I was a&#xD;
Reynolds, I ~would paint you between a northwestern and a&#xD;
hurricane, and become immortal. There, now, your brow&#xD;

That's right; roar on, if you please. I vow, I never heard&#xD;

which Orpheus charmed~the stones and trees. if you had&#xD;
lived in those days, they would have m~trried you to .&amp;amp;lus&#xD;
without doubt."&#xD;
"I will see,, sir, if a servi~.nt can not muster up force enough&#xD;
to remove you to the street," said Miss Willoughby, wheel-&#xD;
ing round from him and walking rapidly toward 'the door,&#xD;
through which her pretty form, trembling with rage, van-&#xD;
ished. Hampton, thinking it would by no means accord with&#xD;
his dignity or tastes to be ejected from the door by a serv-&#xD;
ant, rose, yawned, and then leisurely left the house.&#xD;
To pick a quarrel with her lover, and then discharge him,&#xD;
was the way in which Miss Willoughby usually contrived to&#xD;
rid herself of those to whom she had engaged herself when&#xD;
their attentions became annoying. Generally, ~she experi-&#xD;
enced but little diffioultyin freeing' harseif~from .an engage-&#xD;
ment; but Hampton 11$ previously displayed such a perti-&#xD;
nacious good-humor, such a 'disposition to be pleased. with&#xD;
all her conduct, that, whenever she began to intimate her&#xD;
displeasure with him, he was sure to do something to defeat&#xD;
&#xD;
D BA Y TO N.&#xD;
her~ purpose. At length she thought she had succ~ed0d ~&#xD;
offending him, and she rejoiced that henceforth sh~. shc~iiJ~&#xD;
not be troubled with his attentions. She was n~istakc~L&#xD;
He was by no means offended, for on the ensuing morning&#xD;
he called on her. Of course she did not see him. Itt was&#xD;
only after repeatedly sending him word&#xD;
announced him that she did not by the ser ~ho&#xD;
wish to see him, he&#xD;
ceased to trouble her.&#xD;
Mrs. Willoughby's party on the ensuing week was uni-&#xD;
versally acknowledged to be the most magnificent affair of&#xD;
the season. Neither IDrayton nor, Hampton were there.&#xD;
Hampton was greatly mortified that the very 'Alcibiades of&#xD;
the city should have been left out. As they had always be-&#xD;
fore manifested so much anxiety to cultivate an intimacy,&#xD;
Drayton wondered very much why they neglected him on&#xD;
that brilliant occasion. The morning after the party, he&#xD;
met his friend Singleton, who asked him why he was not&#xD;
at 'the gathering of the previous evening.&#xD;
"The principal reason why I was not there," answered&#xD;
Drayton, smiling, "is,, that I was n6t invited."&#xD;
"Not invited !" said Singleton, looking very much amazed.&#xD;
"Why, Drayton, that is very strange: 'I thought you stood&#xD;
A 1 in the young lady's regard. There must be some mis-&#xD;
take," continued Sin shaking his head very gravely,&#xD;
"and I will find out what it was."&#xD;
"Do not trouble yourself about it," said Drayton. "It is&#xD;
a matter of but little in portanee. If it was a mistake, it&#xD;
will be rectified; and if it was intentional, the less that is&#xD;
said about it the better."&#xD;
A few days afterward Singleton called on Drayton, look~&#xD;
ing deeply concerned about something. As soon as he was&#xD;
seated, he said,&#xD;
"Drayton, my dear fellow, I am just from the Willough-&#xD;
bys, and the old lady told me that you were purposely omit-&#xD;
ted the other night. Do you know how you have offended&#xD;
the lady?"&#xD;
"Indeed I do not."&#xD;
"Well, I do."&#xD;
"What is it?"&#xD;
"You made some shoes once upon a time, did you not ?"&#xD;
inquired Singleton, glancing significantly at him.&#xD;
"I did, sir."&#xD;
"Well, sir, by so doing, you have subjected yourself to the&#xD;
scorn and contumely of the lady."&#xD;
II&#xD;

i7G                 DEAYTO~&#xD;
"And is that the reason she did not honor me with an in-&#xD;
vitation ?" askedDrayton.&#xD;
"It is as true, sir, as any one of the nine-and-thirty Ar-&#xD;
ticles," replied Singleton.&#xD;
"I ~.mglad to hear that my offense was not more gricv.&#xD;
ous,"'~ ~ettirned Drayton.&#xD;
"How ridiculous such things are in a republican country !"&#xD;
said Singleton. "I suppose that if Franklin, Burns, and&#xD;
Shermail had lived here, Mrs. Willoughby would have cut&#xD;
the illustrious trio. She would haAre cut Franklin because&#xD;
he once wicked candles and stuck types-Burns because he&#xD;
was nothing but a poor peasant plowman-and Sherman&#xD;
because he ~Vas once guilty of the unpardonable crime of&#xD;
making shoes. sow, she has more discrimination in such&#xD;
matters than judgment 6r seuse; and she would certainly&#xD;
give the cut direct to her grandfather's ghost, if, like the&#xD;
old king of Denmark's, it should happen to rise up."&#xD;
"Such persons are ~rery ridiculous," said Drayton, "par-&#xD;
ticularly when they have no more cause for their pretensions&#xD;
to superiority than the lady in 'question. What would you&#xD;
say, Singleton, if I should tell you that her grandmother used&#xD;
to make up my grandfather's linen ?"&#xD;
"I should say, sir," replied Singleton, with a smile, "that&#xD;
there had been some queer ups and downs in the families.&#xD;
But it is only what we see every day in this country; and&#xD;
hence the superlative absurdity of those who pretend to make&#xD;
the origin of persons, rather than their 'own meritoriousness,&#xD;
the standard by Which they judge them."&#xD;
"I hope I may be able to survive so severe a cut," said&#xD;
Drayton. "Bi~t, really, I jiate to give up all association with&#xD;
the fair Maria; for, though she is utterly heartless, yet it is&#xD;
very pleasant to talk and flirt with her occasionally. But&#xD;
the old lady's will imi~t be. done."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
'SPRING, ever bright and ever glorious, once more descend-&#xD;
ed on e~rth, and flowing streams and. verdant meadows re-&#xD;
joiced in the breaking up of old winter's icy dominion. All&#xD;
nature ~was ghiddened by the smil~ of the ifower crowned&#xD;
&#xD;
~QN.                  In.&#xD;
goddess. The brooks'iaughed in the sun..-~every breeze came&#xD;
laden with perfume-the bleak forests resumed their foliage&#xD;
.-and birds and insects sang merrily in green field and in&#xD;
woodlaikl. Beauty was throned among the mountains, and&#xD;
her shadow filled all the valleys.&#xD;
Drayton's heart revived the freshness of its feelings as leaf&#xD;
and flower were presented to his View, arid awakei~ed a thou-&#xD;
sand slumbering associations of his earlier years. The win~&#xD;
ter hadpassed heavily over his head. He had mingled? in&#xD;
the social meles of the city, often, it is true, with a sighing&#xD;
heart. No business had yet been offered him. Gloom, day&#xD;
by day, thickened over his prospect of success in his profes-&#xD;
sion. He was still the confiding pensioner of Hope; but her&#xD;
bounties, ample as they were, though they might solace,&#xD;
could not satisfy him. His little store of means was gradw.&#xD;
ally diminishing, and no opportunity of recruiting the waste&#xD;
presented itself. His spirit rejoiced when the cheerlessness&#xD;
of winter gave way to the bland influences of spring, and&#xD;
he frequently left the din and bustling crowds of the tewn,&#xD;
and wandered forth to muse among the beauties of the sur-&#xD;
rounding scenery. Though misfortunes, adversities, and pov-&#xD;
erty may press sorely upon us, yet, thank Heaven! we may&#xD;
still be affluent in our love for all that is beautiful and grand&#xD;
in this outward world-" chill penury" does not always&#xD;
freeze the "genial currents of the soul"-~-~-and we may still&#xD;
gaze with undimmed eyes upon- the stars mirrored in t~e&#xD;
bosom of the stream, and the heart may echo every strain&#xD;
that gushes from the throats of .the forest warblers.&#xD;
One morning early in May, 'Drayton had been raxnbling&#xD;
beyond the precincts of the city, thinking of Ellen l~eredith&#xD;
and her brother. As he approached his office 'slowly, some&#xD;
one saluted him, and on looking round he discovered the&#xD;
bright face of Roger Brown, who, after fumbling about in&#xD;
the depths of several pockets, produced a note. Drayton's&#xD;
eyes sparkled with delight as he glanced at its contents. It&#xD;
was from George Meredith, stating that he had returned&#xD;
home on the previous day. After reading it tWice to make&#xD;
'sure of its conteiits, he placed it in his pocket, and addressed&#xD;
several inquiries to Roger.&#xD;
~" Well, Roger, how does Miss' :E'lleu look ?"&#xD;
';" She looks charming, sir, and pretty much as if she ~wmld&#xD;
take the heart from ~under a man's ribs before he 'could say&#xD;
~1ack R.obinson."&#xD;
"That is very sa.tisfaot6ry," said Drayton, with a.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7761-00000087"/>&#xD;
172           DRAYTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
"and I will give her a chance of robbing me of mine before&#xD;
the sun says good-by to the top of yonder.hill. By-the-way,&#xD;
Roger, how does your love flourish ?"&#xD;
"Like a branch of aweeping-willow or an old cow's tail,&#xD;
sir, for it has a deuced inclination~ to flourish downward."&#xD;
"Why, what's the matter now, Roger? The last time&#xD;
we were talking on that interesting subject, you were in&#xD;
flush spirits. Has the lady jilted you ?"&#xD;
"It's a queer 'piece of business," returned Roger, "and&#xD;
~that's all I know about it. Mary is a very strange sort of&#xD;
a girl, and she's kept me hanging in a state of suspense so&#xD;
long that I begin to think my neck is growing as long as a&#xD;
crane's. Poor girl! she's been very poorly all spring, and&#xD;
I haven't hardly seen her for more than a month. She&#xD;
doesn't look as she did last spring, any how. She's grown&#xD;
mighty pale, and then she don't laugh and run about as she&#xD;
used to. There's something pressing on her heart, and I&#xD;
am afraid that, if she don't mend soon, shell go into a de-&#xD;
cline."&#xD;
Roger sighed, turned his head aside, and began to whistle,&#xD;
to check his rising emotions. IDrayton saw that some very&#xD;
unpleasant thoughts were disturbing him, and, anxious to&#xD;
console him, said,&#xD;
"Her health is not good, Roger, and that's the reason why&#xD;
she seems to regard you less favorably than she formerly did.&#xD;
These girls are strange beings, and sometimes act very mys-&#xD;
teriously. She'll get better before long,, and smile on you&#xD;
as sweetly as ever."&#xD;
"I hope so, sir, but I fear she wont," said Roger, looking&#xD;
very gloomy. "I do love that girl! I try to get the better&#xD;
of it, but I can't; for I don't believe in love that is like the&#xD;
handle of a coffee-cup, all on one side, as I am afraid ours&#xD;
is. 'I saw her the other night, all by ~herself, wandering&#xD;
about in the moonshine, just like a spirit, and looking at the&#xD;
stars, and muttering something to herself that I couldn't&#xD;
hear, all the time. She' acted just as if her brain was&#xD;
touched; and I've thought over it a good deal, and I wouldn't&#xD;
wander if she wasn't exactly in her right mind. She didn't&#xD;
use to avoid every body as she does iiow, and her poor old&#xD;
mother is distressed about her strange ways.,"&#xD;
"It is a singular case," said Drayton, who had listened&#xD;
attentively to Roger's account, "a very mysterious ease,&#xD;
Roger. But cheer up, my dear fellow; the cloud will pass,&#xD;
over her mind soon, and she will be as bright as ever she&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.                    173&#xD;
was. When she recovers from her ailing, she will look upon&#xD;
you more kindly than ever, for a woman always makes&#xD;
amends in that way for any ill treatment she has shown to-&#xD;
ward her lover. Did you never observe that the moon al-&#xD;
ways shines the brighter after she has been struggling among&#xD;
the clouds a while? Well, a woman is like the moon in this&#xD;
particular, and you may rest assured that, when your sweet-&#xD;
heart recovers her spirits, she will be more lively in conse-&#xD;
quence of her temporary sadness."&#xD;
"I hope so, sir,". said Roger; and he sighed again as he&#xD;
wheeled off.&#xD;
Drayton mused a while on what Roger had told him, and&#xD;
then his thoughts reverted to Ellen. His heart was thrilled&#xD;
with joy at the prospect of again enjoying her society. He&#xD;
determined to pursue a course of conduct toward her which&#xD;
would at once satisfy her that he felt a hearty interest in&#xD;
her, and give her no reason to suspect that he cherished a&#xD;
passion for her. Many are the resolves of this sort which&#xD;
are formed; and while every one supposes he will be able to&#xD;
maintain his unviolated, nothing is fhore common than for&#xD;
after experience to convince him of the 'extreme fragility of&#xD;
all such resolutions, for no one can anticipate ~ll the turns a&#xD;
passion may take, and at some unforeseen moment he will&#xD;
unintentionally reveal what he has determined to conceal&#xD;
from all eyes but his own.&#xD;
It was near sundown when Drayton alighted from his&#xD;
horse, and entered the mansion at Oakwood with a flutter-&#xD;
ing pulse and a tell-tale agitation of nerve. He soon had&#xD;
the pleasure of seeing Ellen and her friend Caroline, who&#xD;
had hastened to welcome the return of the wanderers, and&#xD;
George and the colonel. They were in exuberant spirits,&#xD;
and Drayton thought he never saw a company more entire-&#xD;
ly free from all unhappiness. Ellen's complexion was a&#xD;
shade darker than when he last saw her, but her smile and&#xD;
her tones* were the same. A Southern sun had left a deep&#xD;
bronze shadow on George's face, which strengthened its ex-&#xD;
pression, and imparted to it the appearance of an improved&#xD;
condition of health. IDrayton's estimate of the happiness of&#xD;
the company was not at all exaggerated. The colonel's eye&#xD;
sparkled as he observed the animation that enlivened his&#xD;
son's face. Ellen was delighted that she was again at her&#xD;
home, and George and Caroline manifested a great deal of&#xD;
pleasure in being restored to~each other.&#xD;
"And how do you like the South ?" inquired Drayton of&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7761-00000088"/>&#xD;
174               DR4YI~ON.                                                           DLI~Y ~9N.                176&#xD;
&#xD;
Ellen a few minutes' after he had exchanged salutations&#xD;
with her.&#xD;
"I like it very much," she replied. "How could I help&#xD;
it, when I saw my brother's health improving each day un-&#xD;
der the benign influence of its delightful climate? I shall&#xD;
always love the South, because he received so much benefit&#xD;
there."&#xD;
"Did you meet with any irresistible gentlemen with the&#xD;
swart complexions of that sunny elime ?"&#xD;
"Oh no, sir, I resist all complexions alike. Do you not&#xD;
remember how you used to charge me with being the pro-&#xD;
prietress of an adamantine heart ?"&#xD;
"Perfectly well; but I trusted that a Southern sun, and&#xD;
bright skies, and orange groves, and a thousand other things&#xD;
which conspire to render that clime glorious, would soften&#xD;
even your heart, hard as it is."&#xD;
"That hope, like most of the bright sisterhood," she said,&#xD;
gayly, "has gone down in shadow. By-the.~way, I under-&#xD;
stand you have been making love to Miss Willoughby in my&#xD;
absence."&#xD;
"That is true; but that love," replied Drayton, imitating&#xD;
her own thought and mannei~'like~ all of the same family&#xD;
which I have known, is among the Things that were. If&#xD;
you would keep my heart fixed iiPone pla(~e, you must guard&#xD;
it like a faithful sentin~j; for if you wander, how shall it&#xD;
remain stationary ?"&#xD;
"I shall be delighted withhaving the errant thing placed&#xD;
under my control. Lhave always fancied it would: be very&#xD;
pleasant to have a score or so of hearts under one's manage-&#xD;
ment. Such a situation, you know, affords one so many fa-&#xD;
cilities for studying 'human nature."&#xD;
* "Yon differ in~ taste from Miss Randolph," .returned Dray-&#xD;
ton; "for when I went to se~ her a nionth ago, and offered&#xD;
her the control of my heart, she rejected it, because, as she&#xD;
said, she was affluent above all want in the D~session of&#xD;
one."&#xD;
"What is that you say, Mr. Drayton ?" inquired Caroline,&#xD;
who, hearing her name mentioned by him, listened to what&#xD;
he said. He repeated his remark, and she said,&#xD;
"But you have not imparted the true reason why I re-&#xD;
jected it, which was, that it was but a fragment. The prin-&#xD;
cipal portion of it 'wa~s in the sunny South-~.-"&#xD;
"With my friend George," said Drayton, interrupting her.&#xD;
"Or his companion !" added Caroline.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, then, if you spe~k tn4y, Miss, R~4oIph," said&#xD;
IDrayton, "there were no less than four heartsjjeurneyin~&#xD;
together under the blue and beaming skies of the S~th."&#xD;
"Not so; mine was here," said Goorge..&#xD;
"And mine," added Ellen.&#xD;
"Like th~ wandering stars of the shepherds of old, your&#xD;
hearts, in their transit, have been crossing each other's&#xD;
paths," said the colonel, who had been listening attentively&#xD;
to, and laughing h~.rti1y at, the badinage of the young&#xD;
folks.&#xD;
"And what a pity it was that, instead of each one going&#xD;
off by itself, they could not by some good fortune have been&#xD;
brought together into one pre-eminently brilliant cluster, aft-&#xD;
er the fashion of the ?leiades," added Drayton.&#xD;
"In which event, sir," said Ellen, smiling at and contin-&#xD;
uing the conceit, "yours, from its unconquerable propensity&#xD;
to wander off would have soon been the lost Pleiad~"&#xD;
Here the conversatjou was broken off by tl~e entrance of&#xD;
some of the neighboring young ladies and gentlemen. The&#xD;
welcoming were cordial, antI a merry time ensued, which&#xD;
was kept up with undiminished hilarity by all present until&#xD;
supper was announced. After dispatching that meal they&#xD;
returned to the parlors, whither Mr. Roger Brown, who, with&#xD;
his fi4dle, was an indispensable personage at all the merry-&#xD;
makings of the neighborhood, was speedily summoned. That&#xD;
gentleman took his station in one corner, and the feet of the&#xD;
dancers soon responded to the lively music of his favorite in~~&#xD;
strument.&#xD;
They danced with great spirit, as people always do when.&#xD;
any sport 6t the kind is extemporaneous. As Drayton did&#xD;
not participate in that pleasure, he soon found another source&#xD;
of enjoyment. There was a sentimental-looking youth in&#xD;
spectacles present, who was much in love with a young lady&#xD;
with a blonde complexion, whose -red cheeks and mischiev-&#xD;
ous eyes indicated a relish of fun. To tease her lover was&#xD;
the object which Drayton now had at heart. The lady un-&#xD;
dersiood his intentions, and favored them. He paid her the&#xD;
most distinguished attention. He enacted the lover so well&#xD;
that the gentleman in spectacles. soon regarded him as tfr~&#xD;
subject of the most mysteriously sudden and uncontrollaWe&#xD;
passion recorded in the annals of love. As Drayton's atVeu~&#xD;
tions became warmer, the lover's face underwent sundry gro-&#xD;
tesque metamorphoses of expression, thereby displaying the&#xD;
inftuencc of jealousy variously modified. Drayton was de-&#xD;

lighted at his success; and it would have been exceedingly&#xD;
strange if the young lady had not also been delighted, for the&#xD;
sweeter sex always relish these temporary annoyances of&#xD;
their lovers. Indeed, a young gentlexnan who isso unfortu..&#xD;
nate as to be very deeply smitten must expect such perplex-&#xD;
ities; and it always appears to such a one, as he looks on&#xD;
such a scene with an intensely unamiable expression of face,&#xD;
that all the fates and every human being have conspired to&#xD;
thwart his hopes, and to render the stream of love as crook-&#xD;
ed and as devious in its course as one of our Western riv-&#xD;
ers, which travelers, who are in a particularly great hurry,&#xD;
are in the habit of denouncing as the most wayward things&#xD;
in the world. In the present instance the lover watched ev-&#xD;
ery smile which the lady bestowed on Drayton with a most&#xD;
malicious eye. He considered him but as little better than&#xD;
a ~robber, who appropriates* treasures that do not belong to&#xD;
him. As- Drayton led the smiling lady out under the blue&#xD;
heaven and burning stars, her lover's eye flashed fire, and he&#xD;
felt a blood-thirsty passion for revenge throbbing in his bo-&#xD;
som, which tortured him and delighted the idol of his heart.&#xD;
Oh, these flirt~ious are certainly most pleasant things when&#xD;
you do not happen to be their victim; but when they are&#xD;
carried on at the expense of your spirit's tranquillity, you&#xD;
find yourself; singularly enough, very strongly inclined to the&#xD;
oy~inion that they are devices of the evil one, bent on giving&#xD;
a poor devil of a lover a foretaste of the infernal fare that&#xD;
he provides for his guests in his torrid home.&#xD;
Among the happiest of that gay company was Roger&#xD;
Brown, as he stood there sawing his fiddle-strings, and watch-&#xD;
ing the motions of the dancers with a face radiant with good&#xD;
humor. Every one knew him well, for he was always to&#xD;
be seen in such gatherings, and every one had a kind word&#xD;
and a smile for him. Just then, too, his thoughts were un-&#xD;
shadowed, for they were not given to the wayward Mary&#xD;
Winters.&#xD;
After the dance came music of a more tender and senti-&#xD;
mentatcharacter. Ellen took her- seat at her harp, and ran&#xD;
her fingers over its chords, while the company gathered&#xD;
around her. Drayton stood near her, with the lady with&#xD;
whom he had been flirting hanging on his arm, while her&#xD;
moody lover stood' solitary and apart, with his arms tightly&#xD;
folded across his swelling heart, in a corner of the room, from&#xD;
whence he darted on the head of his rival sundry destructive&#xD;
glances. The company was soon composed, and every one,&#xD;
&#xD;
with the solitary exception of the gentleman in spectacles,&#xD;
listened attentively to Ellen's song, which she called&#xD;
THE LOVER'S LAMENT.&#xD;
Love, like a sultan, rules the heart,&#xD;
And bears no rival near his throne;&#xD;
Nor can green earth or sky impart&#xD;
An ecstasy like to his own.&#xD;
Each rebel passion of the soul&#xD;
Submissive bends to his control.&#xD;
The bright round moon from east to west&#xD;
Is flinging~ o'er the earth her beams;&#xD;
From hill and grove, in radiance dressed,&#xD;
Enchantment on the vision beams.&#xD;
But moon, nor hill, nor blooming grove&#xD;
Van win my thoughts from her I love.&#xD;
The music of the moonlit sea&#xD;
Is floating upward from the shore,&#xD;
And blends in witching harmony&#xD;
With each wild song the night-birds pour.&#xD;
My heart, companionless and lone,&#xD;
Heeds not glad bird nor sea-wave's moan.&#xD;
In this rich clime, where all is bright,&#xD;
And Nature ever wears her bloom,&#xD;
Where day is fair, and stars by night&#xD;
Take from the darkness all its gloom,&#xD;
The heart with Natur&amp;amp; should rejoice-&#xD;
But mine has neither song nor voice.&#xD;
It is not that I do not lpve&#xD;
The flower, the bird, the star, the sea,&#xD;
But that away I mourning rove,&#xD;
From one far dearer unto me&#xD;
Than flowery earth, or glorious sky,&#xD;
And all that greets the ear and eye.&#xD;
While thus from home and love away,&#xD;
With fresh delight comes back each scene,&#xD;
Each sacred. hour and glittering day&#xD;
Which to my soul most dear has been-.&#xD;
And when these memories o'er me come,&#xD;
My heart pants for its early home.&#xD;
"Apropos ef that song," said Drayton, stepping nearer to&#xD;
Ellen as the lasl tones of her rich voice died away on the&#xD;
air; "was it an emanation of your spirit while you were a&#xD;
wanderer in the poetical. South ?"&#xD;
"That is a strange question for a philosopher to ask," r~-&#xD;
plied Ellen. "Are you not aware, sir, that those- damsels,&#xD;
whom the heath~n'Greeks called the Muses, like most other&#xD;
damsels, manifest an undeserved piirtiality for your sex, to&#xD;
the almost total neglect of their own&#xD;

"Occasionally, Miss Meredith, notwithstanding their par-&#xD;
tiality for our sex," returned~Drayton, with a smile and a&#xD;
bow, "when they discover a lady wortl4 ~to be called a sis-&#xD;
ter, they are by no means chary of their gifts; and, for my&#xD;
life, I can not see any impropriety in supposing that~ in the&#xD;
instance under consideration, they might have discovered&#xD;
such a one."&#xD;
"Thank you, sir," she said. "I di~ not create the song;&#xD;
I only adapted it to a wild air of my own. Brother can give&#xD;
you all the particulars respecting its origin-not now, how-&#xD;
ever, for I suspect, from his earnest manner, that he is giv-&#xD;
ing the history 'of it to one who is more particularly interest-&#xD;
ed in it than I-am."&#xD;
"I understand you," said Drayton, as he glanced at George,&#xD;
who was conversing with Miss Randolph with great anima-&#xD;
tion, on the opposite side of the room.&#xD;
The company broke up at a late hour; and as Drayton&#xD;
lay on his pillow and recalled the events of the evening, he&#xD;
felt that his heart was more entirely devoted to Ellen than&#xD;
it had previously been.&#xD;
OIIAPtEIL XXIX.&#xD;
THE ensuing morning passed swiftly and pleasantly away&#xD;
at Oakwood. After dinner, George proposed a boat-sail to&#xD;
Drayton.&#xD;
"The breeze is fresh-the boat is a fine one-we can&#xD;
touch at the island, and then pay our respects to the 'Ruins'&#xD;
on the opposite shore. What say you ?"&#xD;
"Nothing-would please me more," returned Drayton, "for&#xD;
I should like to visit that rendezvous of all the evil spirits in&#xD;
this part of the world. Will the ladies not accompany us&#xD;
I .i.ispe~t not," replied 'George, "for they have gone to&#xD;
recover froruthe effect of dissipation 'last night. While they&#xD;
are napping, we shall be amusing ourselves, and by the time&#xD;
we get back 'they will have -roused themselves with fresh-&#xD;
ened spirits for th&amp;amp; evening."&#xD;
Roger appeared at a. 'short distance, and 'George hailed&#xD;
*      him. and 'told him'to get 'the boat 'ready for a sail, to which&#xD;
he assented with a sparkling eye, and proceeded with hasty&#xD;
&#xD;
7&#xD;
P~AYTON.&#xD;
steps toward the shore. He w~s proud of his skill in ~ia~i~&#xD;
aging boats, and was always delighted wheu an opportunity&#xD;
was afforded him for showing it off He soon returned, and&#xD;
announced that every thing was ready#or the sail, and they&#xD;
proceeded to the river.&#xD;
In a few minutes the boat was runmug rapidly before the&#xD;
stiff breeze, with the waves washing her sides and the foam&#xD;
hissing at ,her bow. Roger sat managing the canvas in a&#xD;
waterman-like manner, while George held the rudder. The&#xD;
breeze freshened-the sail bellied beautifully-the little boat&#xD;
sprang over the restless waters, and the island was soon&#xD;
reached.&#xD;
They jumped on shore and wandered about admiring the&#xD;
beauty and luxuriance of the foliage. The island was un-&#xD;
tenanted by man, and over its trees and shrubbery the birds&#xD;
held undisputed possession. Wild flowers were growing in&#xD;
great profusion in every direction, and Drayton stooped down&#xD;
and bogan to gather a bouquet, thinking the wiule of the&#xD;
smile with which Ellen, for whom he designed it, would re-&#xD;
ceive his gift.&#xD;
"I will follow your example," said George~ bending and&#xD;
culling a rose. "I make it a rule never to miss 'an oppor-&#xD;
tunity of assuring the ladies that, when I am' absent from&#xD;
them, ii am still thinking of them. A bouquet culled at such&#xD;
a time as this is a very delicate kind of flattery, for it con-&#xD;
veys to the fair one to whom you present it a. proof that her&#xD;
presence is not necessary to remind you of her tastes and&#xD;
your duty, and you insinuate by the act that one species of&#xD;
beauty suggests to you thoughts of another."&#xD;
"And what becoming ornaments flowers are to a lady !"&#xD;
said Drayton. "I think that, a pure white flower, blooming&#xD;
among a profusion of dark tresses on a lady's head," he con-&#xD;
tinued, thinking of Ellen's sweeping curls- and the flowers&#xD;
she usually wore among them, "is a much superior adorn-&#xD;
ment to her than the most costly gem that ever flashQd in&#xD;
the sun."&#xD;
Meanwhile the less sentimental Roger stood near4he shore,&#xD;
with his hands buried in his pockets, whistling and watching&#xD;
the form ~f a black duck which was floating on the '~river's&#xD;
bosom:&#xD;
"What are yon thinking about ~o profoundly, Roger ?"&#xD;
inquired George, as he approached the place where he&#xD;
stood.&#xD;
"Why, I a j t thinking, sir, what ~ very fine shot&#xD;

I'd hive WI only had my gun here. The way I'd take that&#xD;
*          fellow just under the elbow of his wing would be the right&#xD;
way. A fellow always has these first-rate chances when he&#xD;
can't take advantage, of them."&#xD;
"Instead of standing- there and contemplating murder,&#xD;
you ought to be gathering some of these flowers for your&#xD;
sweetheart. Why don't you collect a posy for her? If I&#xD;
were her, I would jilt you for neglecting her for a black&#xD;
duck."&#xD;
"She'~ sick, and don't care a copper whether I pull any&#xD;
f1o~er&amp;amp; for her or not," returned Roger, as a shade passed&#xD;
over his features.&#xD;
That is the very time when she most needs your atten-&#xD;
-~~4inns. When~she is well she can gather flowers for herself;&#xD;
but now, when she is sick, she would be thankfulfor a pres-&#xD;
ent of that sort."&#xD;
Roger mused a -moment, and then, as if some very inter-&#xD;
esting thought had suddenly flashed on his mind, he began&#xD;
gathering the flowers as eagerly as either of his companions.&#xD;
Their bouquets were soon completed, and they returned to&#xD;
the boat, which was under way again speedily, and career-&#xD;
ing on rapidly toward the opposite shore of the river.&#xD;
They landed, and began ascending the slight eminence on&#xD;
which the " Ruins" were situated, ~at a short distance from&#xD;
the river. ~tany were the marvelous stories in circulation&#xD;
in the neighborhood touching this dilapidated mansion,&#xD;
which had an accursed reputation. According to the popu-&#xD;
lar faith, it was haunted by a legion of wild and capricious&#xD;
spirits. Among the credulous, it was most devoutly believed&#xD;
that the place was in the possession of the evil one and the&#xD;
spirits who were in colleague with him, who kept themselves&#xD;
out of the way, like other- bad things during the light of day,&#xD;
but who, in the dusky twilight, came forth from their lurk-&#xD;
ing places and were to be seen hovering over the spot. Sev-&#xD;
eral well-authenticated stories were told by persons who,&#xD;
having been under the necessity of passing that way at night,&#xD;
had seen~spectacles which caused their cheeks to grow pale&#xD;
and their hair to stand on end. On dark and tempestuous&#xD;
nights especially were these emissaries of the devil to be&#xD;
seen enacting the most fantastic - deeds. Amid the~ ii&amp;amp;wl-&#xD;
ings of the most fearful -storms they held their - infernal ca-&#xD;
rousals, while their mad and demoniacal merriment rang&#xD;
wildly over the tumult which raged outside. Sometimes&#xD;
they were seen collected roujid tables, drinking wine out of&#xD;

the skulls of infants; again you might discover them Nvalk-&#xD;
ing about with torches in their hands, as if seeking some-&#xD;
thing which had been lost; and one of the niost common&#xD;
spectacles was to see haggard old. women standing on the&#xD;
chimneys with bloody daggers in their hands, while their&#xD;
tangled~ - locks and dingy dresses flapped violently in the&#xD;
night Winds. For what particular object these mysterious&#xD;
meetings took place no one had yef 1~een able to discover,&#xD;
although many shrewd surmises were ventured on by the su-&#xD;
perstitious. It was generally conceded that some dark and&#xD;
bloody tragedy had been perpetrated there, since which time&#xD;
the house had been abandoned by human beings, and was in&#xD;
the possession of the enemies of our species. Tht~re~vyere&#xD;
some stains On the floor, which were regarded by many -witl~&#xD;
the most holy horror, for tradition said they were caused by&#xD;
the blood of a most beautiful and innocent girl, who had there&#xD;
sacrificed her life rather than yield her honor.&#xD;
The site o~ the ~-' Ruins" was eminently beautiful. For&#xD;
some miles below the winding of the river were distinctly&#xD;
visible, with here and there a. green island lifting up its verd-&#xD;
ure to the light of heaven. The country on the opposite&#xD;
side stretched gradually upward from the shore, presenting a&#xD;
wide view of houses, and fields, and woodlands,~while at the&#xD;
extremity of the landscape the city was seen with its spires&#xD;
pi*~i~g the dusky atmosphere which hnng over it. When&#xD;
the.y1r~ached the deserted mansion, Drayton stopped to sur-&#xD;
vey the beautiful jrosper~t spread out before him, thinking it&#xD;
the mo~I~ magnificent he had eVer seen. After admiring the&#xD;
varied beauties of the scenery, they advanced to the old pile&#xD;
of bplldings, which was very fitly denominated the "Ruins,"&#xD;
for ~very thing spoke of desolated grandeur. The mansion&#xD;
had been constructed on an extensive scale, and in former&#xD;
times was the residence of wealth and splendor~ The stone--&#xD;
was blackened by storms; the windows were all broken out;&#xD;
the front door had rotted and fallen from its hinges, tind floors&#xD;
and walls were sadly dilapidated. Swallows - made their&#xD;
nests in the rooms in which princely hospitality once enter-&#xD;
tamed its guests,~-and, as they flitted through the windows,&#xD;
their twitterings sounded as melancholy as the rustlings of&#xD;
the dry -leaves in a grav0-yard when the frosty winds of au-&#xD;
tumn are moaning over the decay of nature's pomp and&#xD;
beauty.&#xD;
They stepped into the hall, and every word they ~uttere&amp;amp;~&#xD;
echoed over the mysteriOus silence -that reigned within like.  - - -&#xD;

the voice of desolation. As they went ~n a sceiie of de-&#xD;
struction presented. itself. Floors ~w~itels, doors, ceilings,&#xD;
had been torn from their places, azi&amp;amp;Vtrewed in fragments&#xD;
around. Some portions of the walls remained, and the rich&#xD;
'cornice attested the magnificence of the whole structure be-&#xD;
fore the ruthless hand~ of devastation had~ done its work.&#xD;
As he stood within one ~of the spacious rooms, surveying the&#xD;
havoc which had there been done, Draytoxi turned to George&#xD;
and said,&#xD;
"I do not wonder that the superstitioii~ should imagine&#xD;
this place to be a ~ conveuticle for witches, and hobgob-&#xD;
lins, and infernal spirits of all sorts to hold their meetings in,&#xD;
for really, even in the light of day, there is a feeling of des-&#xD;
Qlation here quite oppressive, and one involuntarily treads&#xD;
lightly lest he should start some slumbering spirit from its&#xD;
recesses."&#xD;
"Don't be alarmed, sir; there is not the least danger here&#xD;
by day," said George~ smiling, "fox they who are most know-&#xD;
ing on sueh subjects seriously affirm that .you can't see a&#xD;
spirit by the light of the sun. Such things, strange enough,'&#xD;
can only be seen when one can see nothing else. ~There&#xD;
was a courageous fellow here, once upon a time, who for a&#xD;
wager undertook to remain in this place through a tempest-&#xD;
uous night. He did not linger long, but soon returned af-&#xD;
frighted to his anxious friends, and gave them such a terri-&#xD;
ble account of the marvelous things he had seen that no one&#xD;
has 'been willing to repeat the experiment. I think, Rog-&#xD;
er," he added, tuning toward that personage, "that you&#xD;
once saw something very awful here !"&#xD;
Roger was engaged in writing his name on the wall. As&#xD;
soon as he heard the inquiry which was addressed to him,&#xD;
he wheeled suddenly rouna and answered,&#xD;
" Yes, sir, I did."&#xD;
"Well, what was it that you saw&#xD;
"The devil," said Roger; in a low toue of yoice.&#xD;
"The devil !" repeated George, affecting great astonish-&#xD;
xnent; "' and why do you suppose it ~was he ?"&#xD;
"Because nobody else is as big and as ~black as he is,"&#xD;
replied Roger, approaching George, and speaking scarcely&#xD;
above a whisper~ "He was as big ~s one of the trees out&#xD;
here ~ his head reached up to the top. of the chimney, and&#xD;
he was smoking a cigar about as long and as thick as my&#xD;
leg. He put qne hand in his breeches' pochet, and walked&#xD;
up and down in front of the house puffing 9ut more smoke&#xD;

than a chimney, and keeping his fiery red eyes fixed on me&#xD;
all the time when his~~ck wasn't turned."&#xD;
"Why didn't you some conversation with his black&#xD;
majesty ?"&#xD;
"I talk with the devil, sir !" said Roger, evidently much&#xD;
amazed at the suggestion; "I talk with the devil! Oh no,&#xD;
you don't catch this child doing any thing of that sort, I tell&#xD;
you; the less one has to say to him the better. Besides,&#xD;
what do you suppose, I could talk to him about ?"&#xD;
"Why," replied George, "you might have asked him if&#xD;
he had seen any of your friends lately; or how the weather&#xD;
was in his country; or what the prospect .of crops was."&#xD;
"Oh, you're only poking fun at me," said Roger. "Now,&#xD;
sir, if you were to see him, you would be mighty clear of&#xD;
asking him any such questions."&#xD;
"Indeed, I should like to hold a conversation with him&#xD;
very much," returned George, "for he is said to be a very&#xD;
rewd and intelligent old gentleman. If he was in a talk-&#xD;
ve mood, he could tell one about a thousand interesting&#xD;
ventures he has met with when he has come up to this&#xD;
'earth to see how his friends were getting along."&#xD;
"Oh, 1~r. Meredith, how you talk !"&#xD;
"Didn't I see you writing your name over yonder on the&#xD;
wall a while ago ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I wrote it there," answered Roger.&#xD;
"I would advise you to go and rub it out," said George,&#xD;
"for perhaps, when that sooty old fellow eomes back and&#xD;
sees it, he will think you want to see him, just as a doctor&#xD;
would if he was to see your name written on his slate; and&#xD;
if he should return your visit, you will have no place to ac-&#xD;
commodate him in, if he is as big as you say he is."&#xD;
While Roger was engaged in removing his name from the&#xD;
wall, George and Drayton passed into an adjoining room.&#xD;
Roger soon hurried after them, as he did not fancy being&#xD;
left to himself in a house which had so bad a reputation,&#xD;
and as there was no telling at' what moment one might be&#xD;
spirited away from his friends 'to climeArnuch less pleasant&#xD;
than any months planet.&#xD;
"Here it i~rnd all the water that ever fell from heaven&#xD;
couldn't wash i~ 'out !" exclaimed Roger, stooping down and&#xD;
looking earnestly at some stains on the floor in one corner&#xD;
of the' ap~tment.&#xD;
"What have you found the&#xD;
approaching him.     ,   re, Roger ?" inquired Drayton,&#xD;

"Look here and see..-.it's as plain as the nose on my face?'&#xD;
"Then it's tolerably plain, Roger. But what is it? I&#xD;
can see nothing ?"&#xD;
"Don't you see the black spots here, and here, on these&#xD;
boards?"&#xD;
"Yes; and what of them?" -&#xD;
"Why, they are blood," replied Roger, looking up,,~,t Dray-&#xD;
ton with a very serious expression of face. "It is the blood&#xD;
of that pretty and innocent young lady~"&#xD;
"Did some pretty and innocent young lady's nose take a&#xD;
fancy to shed a few drops of blood there ?" asked Drayton.&#xD;
"Why, sir, you speak as if you didn't know any thing&#xD;
about it," said Roger, rising and looking steadfastly at Dray-&#xD;
ton, as if he wondered how any one could possibly be igno-&#xD;
rant of what was so familiar to himself. Drayton assured&#xD;
him that he knew nothing of the blood, and thereupon Roger&#xD;
cleared his throat, and, looking as pale as if the horrible&#xD;
deed were at that moment taking place, said,&#xD;
"Why, sir, from all accounts, it must be over a hundred~&#xD;
years since there was a very pretty young. lady decoyed here&#xD;
by the man that lived in this house, and he killed her here&#xD;
in this very spot. It was a very stormy nights and ever&#xD;
since, on stormy nights, she comes back, and walls about&#xD;
with the red blood running from her throat."&#xD;
"That's a very remarkable fact, Roger; but how do you&#xD;
know she comes back? I should think she would shun this&#xD;
place more than any other."&#xD;
"It is strange, sir, ~ut she does come back," returned&#xD;
Roger, as positively as if i\e had seen the young lady in ques-&#xD;
tion a thousand times; "'why, ever so many people have seen&#xD;
her.' I never did, but my uncle told me he saw her as plain&#xD;
as I - see you, sir; and he also said that she was the most&#xD;
beautiful young lady he ever 'did see."&#xD;
"And. this is the blood ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, without doubt," replied 1~oger.&#xD;
"And what became of the wretch who murdered her ?"&#xD;
"Why, he lived~.here a little while afterward; and they&#xD;
say that he was almost haunted to death by her ghost, until&#xD;
one bitter cold and stormy night, when the devil came after&#xD;
him and took him away, and no mortal eye ever saw that&#xD;
man since. Every body was afraid to live in this house&#xD;
after that night, and it has been given up to spirits of all&#xD;
kinds, and you can see them here any night you may choose&#xD;

"I think I'll take your word for it and stay away," said&#xD;
Drayton, as he left Roger and joined George.&#xD;
"You had better, sir, unless you want to disappear like a&#xD;
butterfly when a cat-bird is near it," added Roger..'&#xD;
They wandered about inspecting every object of interest.&#xD;
George related many traditions associated with the deserted&#xD;
mansion, and, thus employed, an hour glided imperceptibly&#xD;
away. Suddenly they were called to notice what was pass-&#xD;
ing out of doors by a violent gust of wind which swept by.&#xD;
Roger ran to a window, and, looking out, informed them that&#xD;
they had better return to Oakwood, as the wind was increas-&#xD;
ing. While they had been wandering through the deserted&#xD;
building, the wind had been steadily increasing in violence,&#xD;
and it now blew with sufficient fury to bow the long grass&#xD;
to the earth, and to cause the waves on the surface of the&#xD;
river to 'be whitened with foam.&#xD;
"It is time to go," said George, "or the passage of the&#xD;
river will have more peril than pleasure for us."&#xD;
"I say ditto to that, sir," said Roger, "and I'll run on&#xD;
ahead of you, and get all things ready by the time that you&#xD;
get down to the boat."&#xD;
Saying this, he started off as fast as he could run, jump-&#xD;
ing a couple of fences on the way, and reached the boat be-&#xD;
fore his companions had passed half the distance from the&#xD;
house to the shore.&#xD;
CHAPTER. XXX.&#xD;
THE afternoon was fast wearing away, and Ellen and her&#xD;
friend Caroline still remained in their chamber. The col-&#xD;
onel was sitting in the library~ enjoying Bolingbroke's "Re-&#xD;
flections on Exile" for the hundredth time, when a gust of&#xD;
wind, which caused the windows to rattler startled him. He&#xD;
rose and looked out to see if George and Drayton were re-&#xD;
turning. Not seeing them, he placed the volume on the ta-&#xD;
ble and proceeded to the pdrch.&#xD;
A thin vail of vapor was stretched over the sky, and the&#xD;
sun's disk was pale and watery. The wind blew fitfully&#xD;
from' the northeast. The trees would bend to the more vio-&#xD;
lent gusts as they' swept by, and, in the next minute, a calm&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7761-00000094"/>&#xD;
186                 P~4YTON.&#xD;
would follow. A storm wa~ evidently brewing in the heav-&#xD;
ens, and as Colonel Meredith surveyed the threatening pros-&#xD;
pect, he felt fearful lest the young men should delay their&#xD;
return tQO long. As he stood glai~ing toward the opposite&#xD;
shore of the river, the ladies apprJached, and tllen, placing&#xD;
her hand on his arm, inquired,&#xD;
"Where are brother and Mr. Drayton ?"&#xD;
"Whey took a sail after y~ii retired. I saw them an hour&#xD;
ago land ou the other shore and pass up toward the 'Ruins.'&#xD;
It is strange they remain so long, for the wind is increasing&#xD;
every minute."&#xD;
A sudden blast rustled the foliage, and swept back the&#xD;
clustering curls from BIlen's cheeks. She cowered before&#xD;
the breeze, and, with her lip pale and tremulous with emo-&#xD;
tion, and in a voice just audible above the wind, said,&#xD;
"Oh! I wish they would return! There i~ no danger, is&#xD;
there, father ?" she inquired, glancing anxiously at his face.&#xD;
"There is but little danger now; but as the wind is grow-&#xD;
ing more violent, it would be unsafe to .attemptto cross the&#xD;
river if they linger where they are much longer. Roger is&#xD;
with them, and he is an experienced waterman."&#xD;
Caroline said nothing, but stood gazing anxiously toward&#xD;
the opposite shore. Her eye was the first to discover 1ioger&#xD;
as he emerged from the deserted house and passed rapidly&#xD;
down the hill to the boat.&#xD;
"There is some one leaving the old house," she exclaim-&#xD;
ed, eagerly, "and I hope they are all ready to return. There&#xD;
come the others," she added, as the fo~ms of George and&#xD;
Drayton were dimly visible in the distance.&#xD;
Accompanied by Colonel Meredith, they proceeded to the&#xD;
river bank, with their dresses fluttering violently in the winds&#xD;
as thq fitful gusts swept by. When they reached the bank&#xD;
they Wayed their handkerchiefs~ in order to attract the at-&#xD;
tex~on of the young men, whose actions they were noticing&#xD;
with such painful interest. The river was wide, and the&#xD;
boat was lying more than a mile from where they stood.&#xD;
When George and Drayton reached the boat the ladies&#xD;
waved their handkercWeifs again, and the signal was re-&#xD;
turned. The winds rose with greater fury, and the ladies&#xD;
found considerable difficulty in maintaining their positions,&#xD;
where the blasts had such an unobstructed sweep against&#xD;
their persons.&#xD;
The young men entered the boat, and Roger, who had got&#xD;
every thing ready for sailing, turned to George and said,&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.           187&#xD;
&#xD;
"The breeze blows down stream, and you must keep the&#xD;
boat's head up as well as you can, else we'll land too low,&#xD;
and this is rather too stiff a wind to be tacking aboi~t in.&#xD;
Bless me, but we'll cut it..s~ross to them charming ladies like&#xD;
a swallow."&#xD;
"Don't you think we had better take in the sail and row&#xD;
her across ?" said George, as a gust swept past them.&#xD;
"Oh no, sir," replied Roger. "Iv'e been out in this craft&#xD;
in many a stiffer breeze than this. There's not a bit of&#xD;
danger. You just keep the rudder right, and I'll' manage&#xD;
this bit of canvas, and the way we'll cut the white-caps in&#xD;
two will be charming."&#xD;
With this he tightened the sail, which had been flapping&#xD;
in the wind, and in the next instant a gust filled it and&#xD;
strained the ropes. Away the little boat sprang from the&#xD;
shore, like a high-mettled horse panting for the race.&#xD;
As Dtayton pressed his hat tighter on his head, buttoned&#xD;
his coat, and looked out upon the expanse of raging waters,&#xD;
his cheek grew pale, and, although he said nothing, he felt&#xD;
that his situation was far from being free from peril. How-&#xD;
ever, he contrived to put a good face on the danger, and&#xD;
tried to look as cheerful as possible. His fear did not es-&#xD;
cape the watchful eye of Roger, who glar~ced keenly at him,&#xD;
and coolly remarked,&#xD;
"I reckon, Mr. Drayton, you're not very much used to sail-&#xD;
ing in a high wind."&#xD;
Drayton smiled at this remark, showing as it did that his&#xD;
feelings had been penetrated, and answered,&#xD;
"No, Roger, this is my first experiment in such a gale,&#xD;
and, if it please Heaven, it shall be my last. I confess I had&#xD;
as lief be on the other shore as where I am now, with this&#xD;
boat buffeting these waves.~~&#xD;
"I don't wonder at your remark, sir," said Roger, looking&#xD;
quizzically at him, "seeing the ladies are standing there.&#xD;
I know you are very fond of them, for, whenever I see you&#xD;
alongside of them, your eye sparkles. But there's no danger&#xD;
here, sir. See how we cut the water now! You can feel&#xD;
her motion as she runs over the waves, just like a sleigh over&#xD;
a rough road. She's a first-rate craft, and is as safe and as&#xD;
much at home on the water as a duck."&#xD;
The boat flew before the wind. She dashed the waves&#xD;
proudly aside, leaving a. 'streak of white foam in 'her wake.&#xD;
At times her sail nearly touched the bosom of the river.&#xD;
But onward she went, and Roger seemed to enjoy her mo-&#xD;
&#xD;

-tion exceedingly, for his eye was beaming, and his cheek&#xD;
was flushed with enthusiasm.&#xD;
"Head her a little more up stream, if you please, Mr.&#xD;
Meredith, or you'll strike- the shore below the ladies. Now&#xD;
we go-now we fly, as if this little craft was mad. She can&#xD;
beat any thing of her inches on the river. Don't she ride&#xD;
beautifully ?" he concluded, brushing the spray from his face&#xD;
with his coat sleeve.&#xD;
"Now we are in the middle of the river !" exclaimed&#xD;
Drayton, who was busy in calculating distances, and specu-&#xD;
lating on the probability of their reaching the shore.&#xD;
This would be pleasant if one was only insured against&#xD;
all peril," said George, who was not altogether unpossessed&#xD;
of fear. "Now we fly !" he continued, as the gale bowed&#xD;
the canvas like a swallow's wing toward the water; "now&#xD;
we fly like a bird, and in less than five minutes we shall be&#xD;
with the ladies. See, Drayton," he added, "see how much&#xD;
interest they take in our progress! And look how they wave&#xD;
their handkerchiefs in the breeze !"&#xD;
The ladies were not only interested, but they were greatly&#xD;
excited with apprehensions. They were both pale with&#xD;
fright whenever a gust of wind struck the sail. They&#xD;
watched the boat's progress with the most painful emotions.&#xD;
Once, when the sail, to her fearing eye, seemed touching the&#xD;
wave, Ellen grasped her father's arm convulsively, and ex-&#xD;
claimed&#xD;
"Oh! they will be upset! Why don't they take i~ILat sail&#xD;
down and row the boat home? It is very fool-hardy to run&#xD;
such risks," she added; as the boat righted again, and came&#xD;
straining ~on toward them.&#xD;
"They should certainly take in their sail," observed the&#xD;
colonel, calmly, notwithstanding the fears which he strove&#xD;
to conceal from the ladies. "But," he added, "Roger is a&#xD;
good waterman, and he would not wantonly risk their lives.&#xD;
I wish they were at land."&#xD;
Caroline's excitement was very obvious, notwithstanding&#xD;
her silence. She shuddered as each successive squall of&#xD;
wind swayed the boat from her upright position. Whenev-&#xD;
er she fancied their peril particularly imminent, she walked&#xD;
nervously up and down the bank, wringing her hands and&#xD;
wearing an expression of deep distress. When the winds&#xD;
would sweep less violently, and the boat became righted, she&#xD;
waved her handkerchief, and her face parted with some of&#xD;
its agony.&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.           189&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
In truth, it was fearful to see the waters dashing about in&#xD;
such wild commotion. The surface of the river was full of&#xD;
white-caps, as the foaming crests of the waves are called.&#xD;
The heavens grew darker, the river was lashing furiously,&#xD;
about, the winds increased in violence, and danger seemed&#xD;
frowning on the rash attempt to l~ully the elemental strife&#xD;
at such a time. But all was as yet safe, and the boat came&#xD;
nearer and nearer, diminishing the distance to the shore rap-&#xD;
idly. She was now so near that Roger's voice, shouting a&#xD;
wild salutation, reached the ears of the ladies.&#xD;
But a hundred yards at length separated them from the&#xD;
destined shore, and joy sparkled once more in every face.&#xD;
The ladies felt that the danger was over, and spoke .more&#xD;
cheerfully. Suddenly a gust of wind, more violent than any&#xD;
they had yet encountered, swept by them, and the sail ~of&#xD;
the bounding boat skimmed the angry surface of the river.&#xD;
Ellen shrieked aloud, and Caroline turned her head aside.&#xD;
Again she was righting, but as she rose, a squall, still more&#xD;
violent, struck the sail and laid it flat on the surface of the&#xD;
water. A simultaneous scream broke from the ladies. Ellen&#xD;
fell, overpower~id by her emotions, in her father's arms, and&#xD;
Caroline ran like a maniac, with her tresses streaming be-&#xD;
hind her, along the river's bank. The wind, which now~&#xD;
raged furiously, tore the shawl from her shoulders, while&#xD;
she, unmindful of what she did, sprang down the bank and&#xD;
ran until her feet touched the waters. There she stood, look-&#xD;
ing toward the river, while her shrieks of distress rang with&#xD;
a heart-piercing wildness over the mingling strife of winds&#xD;
and waves.&#xD;
The colonel disengaged himself from his daughter and~ ran&#xD;
toward Caroline, fearing lest she, in the desperation of her&#xD;
feelings, might unconsciously rush into the angry stream.&#xD;
He caught her form as it was bending over the water in his&#xD;
arms, and dragged her from the surf. Having accomplished&#xD;
this, he glanced at the boat, and saw a spectacle which&#xD;
caused the blood to rush back on his heart.&#xD;
They were all struggling in the water. Roger was the&#xD;
only one who retained his composure.&#xD;
"Take to the boat, Mr. Drayton," he screamed, "and hold&#xD;
on to her. I can swim, and I'll help Mr. Meredith and save&#xD;
him from drowning."&#xD;
Drayton grasped-the kepi of. the boat, and, glancing at his&#xD;
companions, saw Roger i4 the act of seizing George, who,&#xD;
not being able to support himself, was sinking. As Roger&#xD;
&#xD;

caught him with &amp;amp; fi~m grasp and lifted his head above the&#xD;
watCrs, he exclaimed,&#xD;
Cling 'to' me~-.e1ing to me, Mr. Meredith! The boat&#xD;
will drive down her~'~ a minute, ~nd then you can get on&#xD;
her and be safe."&#xD;
Drayton obeyed his first impulse, and, springing from the&#xD;
boat, reached the side of his friend in the next instant.&#xD;
"Go back to the boats sir !" shouted Roger~ "and I will&#xD;
take care of him. There' catch 'her as she floats past!"&#xD;
With one han~t firmly g~rasping George's, Drayton extend.&#xD;
ed the other and laid hord of the rudder of the boat as she&#xD;
was driving down before the winds. Iii a moment he drew&#xD;
~ George to her side, and, assisted by Roger, elevated his friend&#xD;
aboVe the Waters, exclaiming,&#xD;
fold to the boal firmly, ~r Heaven's sake, 'George, and&#xD;
we will push her to the shore V'&#xD;
in 'a few moments the beat struck the sand and swung&#xD;
round. ~' Roger naught George in h'is brawny arms and bore&#xD;
hhh up the bank.&#xD;
Ellen Was just recovering her consciousnesss as Roger&#xD;
reached the spot Where she had sank down to the ground.&#xD;
She sprang up, and, clasping her arms about her brother's&#xD;
neck~ kissed him fervently, and e~cCiaimed,&#xD;
"'Oh, rny~ brother! my brother! is he ~'afe.-4s 'he ~afe ?"&#xD;
Overpowered again by her violent emotions, she reeled,&#xD;
and as she fell Prayton caught her *n his arms.&#xD;
The lapse ofa few minutes saw theizi all s&amp;amp;fo in the house.&#xD;
George was too weak to walk. He was a~si~t~d to his eham-&#xD;

parent brow, or clapping her hands when the rainbow span-&#xD;
ned the dark form of the receding cloud.' Her step had lost&#xD;
its buoyancy, and her spirit was languidand dull; her heart&#xD;

Often 'she inightbe seen at her window, apparently look-&#xD;
ing out upon the verdant landscape, when her eye was dim~&#xD;
with some unpleasant feeling, and she saw no beauty there.&#xD;
The 'little garden between the house and the road, in culti-&#xD;
vating which she had onee taken so much pride, was now&#xD;
'~ad'ly neglected, and the vines, interlocked with weeds, grew&#xD;
as tangled and as wayward as the thoughts of her whose&#xD;

lo~ig," said the old woman, tartly; "you act just as if you&#xD;
was in love, and if you be so, why in the name of common&#xD;
sense don't you marry him, and put an end to it."&#xD;
"Marry, mother! Who shall I marry?"&#xD;
"Marry who ?" repeated the old woman, in a shrj.ll voice;&#xD;
"why, who would you marry but Roger 'P'&#xD;
don't love him, mother," replied Mary, calmly.&#xD;
shouldn't wonder if you was in love with that man&#xD;
Hampton, like a fool as you are," said the old woman, with&#xD;
the look and the tone of a termagant. "What do you think&#xD;
he cares for a poor girl like you ?"&#xD;
"Oh, my dear mother, do not mention that man s name&#xD;
to me again, if you please, for I hate hiin.-I despise him,"&#xD;
returned Mary, with a flashing eye, her cheek reddening as&#xD;
abe uiougnt of him. "He is a wretch-he is a viper !" she&#xD;
continued, muttering in* an under tone, and her lips moved&#xD;
after her words ceased to be audible,&#xD;
Wearied with the altercation, Mary rose from her seat,&#xD;
and walked out in front of the cottage; and, stooping down,&#xD;
she disengaged one of the viues which was trailing on the&#xD;
ground, and was in the act of twining it round a string which&#xD;
reached down from the top of one of the windows, when, a&#xD;
voice fall on her ear, saying;&#xD;
"Good niorning, Mary 'I hope I see you well."&#xD;
* The voice was Roger's, and a melancholy smile passed&#xD;
over her features as she answered,&#xD;
""Ohly poorly, I thank you.~~&#xD;
"Miss Ellen sent me. here to get you to come over and&#xD;
 help her to-day," said Roger, advancing toward her. "She&#xD;
says she hasn't seen you since she came home, and she'll be&#xD;
offended if you don't come."&#xD;
"Tell her I am too sick to come," said Mary, sighing bit-&#xD;
terly.&#xD;
"She says she won't take any excuse," said Roger; and&#xD;
while she' was hesitating what reply to make, he added, "I&#xD;
suppose you heard what a time, we had yesterday evening ?"&#xD;
"'I did not hear any thing; what was it?"&#xD;
"Why, you see," returned Roger, "that Mr. Meredith,&#xD;
Mr. Drayton, and I went over in the sail-boat to that old&#xD;
haunted house, and we got upset as we were coming home.&#xD;
I always thought it was bad luck going to that place, and&#xD;
I mean. to keep away from it hereafter. Well, as I was&#xD;
going to say, we got upset, and Mr. Meredith came within&#xD;
an ace of being' drowned."&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.                    1~3&#xD;
"You don't tell me so !" exclaimed Mary, starting back,'&#xD;
and holding up her hands in astonishment.' "And how is&#xD;
Mr. Meredith ntw?"&#xD;
"He's pretty well this morning, I believe."&#xD;
"Then I'll go and see him," said Mary, taking a step to-&#xD;
ward the house. Suddenly she stopped, and, directing her&#xD;
eyes 1;o the ground, appeared to be engrossed with some deep&#xD;
and troublesome thoughts, for she sighed, and looked very&#xD;
sorrowful.&#xD;
"Come, Mary, you had better make haste, and I'll do my-&#xD;
self the pleasure Qf walking along with you," said Roger,&#xD;
wondering why she hesitated.&#xD;
"I don't think I ought to go," she murmured, still con-&#xD;
tinuing to look on the ground. "No, I can't go," she con-&#xD;
tinued, in a low tone. "I am not well enough. Yes, I&#xD;
ought to go: I will go !" she added, in a firmer voice.&#xD;
While Mary was making preparations to visit Oakwood,&#xD;
Roger gave the old woman a liy~ly account of the accident&#xD;
which had occurred on the previ6~ day, not forgetting the&#xD;
important part he had acted. His n~rr~tive interested the&#xD;
old lady very deeply, as was manifest froni'The horror which&#xD;
her countenance exhibited. She applauded ]II.oger warmly&#xD;
for his~ efforts in saving George, telling him he had acted like&#xD;
a hero.&#xD;
Attended by Rogcr, Mary proceeded toward the residence&#xD;
of Colonel Meredith; and, as they walked along, he gave&#xD;
her. a second edition of the story, much improved and highly&#xD;
embellished, with which he had already delighted and ter-&#xD;
rified her mOther.&#xD;
She spent the day at Oakwood, and the shadows of even-&#xD;
ing, were stealing over earth, when she started to return to&#xD;
her home. On reaching the road, she perceived a man on&#xD;
horseback coming toward her from the city. When he got&#xD;
near enough, she recognized him, and started back as he&#xD;
addressed her familiarly.&#xD;
"Ah! my fair lady, whither wend ye at so late an hour,&#xD;
without a gallant ?" inquired Hampton.&#xD;
Her frame shivered with contending emotions as his voice&#xD;
greeted her ear. It was the first time she had seen him'&#xD;
since her visit to the city. She had loved him deeply, until&#xD;
his conduct convinced her that he was a villain. H~ love&#xD;
gave .way before a feeling of intense hatred as a sense of the&#xD;
wrongs he had practiced came over her with a subduing&#xD;
power. Shc now loathed him with a bitterness she had not&#xD;

before experienced. She did not ansWer his question, and&#xD;
he added,&#xD;
"You've grown distant to your old friend hand lover."&#xD;
"I wish, sir, you would ride on and leave me to myself.&#xD;
You're a villain, and I want to~have nothing to do or to say&#xD;
to such a creature !"&#xD;
"Don't you get into a rage, my pretty pet," said Hamp-&#xD;
ton, riding nearer to her; "it don't become you. Come,&#xD;
n~y lady fair, give me your hand, and let's make up," he&#xD;
added, "leaning over his saddle and extending his "hand to-&#xD;
ward her.&#xD;
"If you hadn't all the impudence in the world, you&#xD;
wouldn't dare to speak to me," said Mary, firmly, while her&#xD;
eye flashed with rage, and she recoiled from his proffered&#xD;
hand. "You're a vile wretch-your heart ~s black with&#xD;
crim"~; and do you think that, knowing you as well as I do,&#xD;
I would touch your hand ?"&#xD;
Hampton laughed, and in a sarcastic tone inquired, "If&#xD;
I am a vile wretch, what are you ?"&#xD;
"A girl that was innocent until she knew you," she re-&#xD;
plied. , "One whose chief sin is, that she listened to your&#xD;
poisonous breath. One whose life you have made bitter.&#xD;
One that thinks you hatef~ and scorns you as "she ~vould a&#xD;
sei~pent. One that trusted you, not knowing what you were,&#xD;
and was Ietrayed by you."&#xD;
Is that all ?" asked Hampton, satirically. "It all comes,&#xD;
my lady, of having such a pretty face as you have. Don't&#xD;
blame me, but your own blue eye and red lip."&#xD;
The blood rushed to her cheeks-her brain reeled-and&#xD;
she could scarcely support her excited frame. In that mo-&#xD;
zneiit was born a passion, of'which, until then, she had known&#xD;
but little-a deep and strong desire to be revenged on the&#xD;
man who had won her confidence by fair and solemn prom-&#xD;
ises, only to betray her. The thought that he should now&#xD;
dare to laugh at her for trusting to him was more than she&#xD;
could bear. She might 'have borne neglect, but* she 'could&#xD;
not brook his taunts. All the pride of her heart rose and&#xD;
spurned the thought of passively submitting to 'his jeers.&#xD;
She felt her right arm nerved with unusual strength, and&#xD;
wished for the power to inflict on the heartless perpetrator&#xD;
of her wrongs the punishment she knew he merited. She&#xD;
ittemjited to speak, but her tongue was paralyzed by passion.&#xD;
She passed on a short distance and turned, and, looking stern-&#xD;
ly at him, exclaimed,&#xD;
&#xD;
"You'll suffer fot this."&#xD;
She walked from him ~rapidly, while sounds .of laughter,&#xD;
and words which she did not understand, "but Which she felt&#xD;
to 'be insulting, reached her par. The intense agitation of her&#xD;
feelings soon overcame laer, and she sat down by the road-&#xD;
side and wept bitterly. When she again rose 'it was grow-&#xD;
ing dark, and she proceeded homeward with a firkner~ and&#xD;
quicker step. Arrived there, she complained" of dizziness&#xD;
and sickness, and retired to her chamber. With her head&#xD;
on her pillow, she thought of'~mauy means of ~gratifying her&#xD;
revenge, until her thoughts became wild and' delirious. Her&#xD;
pulsation grew violent-her ~hcart throbbed~.-and a raging&#xD;
fever soon burned in every vein.&#xD;
For a 'week her recovery Was considered doubtful by her&#xD;
physician. At 'the expiration of that time "the disease as..&#xD;
sumed more favorable symptoms, and she began to conva-&#xD;
lesce. It was the first 'of June before "she was able to walk&#xD;
abroad, and look upon the gr~en and smiling landscape." To&#xD;
herj eye every tree and hill seemed changed. At times her&#xD;
words were wild and mysterious. It was "obvious "that her&#xD;
reason was clouded, 'and that some strange 'hallucination had&#xD;
usurped the "dominion of "her mind.&#xD;
Roger was deeply affected by her illness, ~auid visited the&#xD;
house "each "day to learn how the disease was "progressing.&#xD;
When she grew strong "enough to "'walk 'forth, he stilL con~&#xD;
tinted his "visits, for she was kinder to him than "she h~id&#xD;
ever been before. All his former 'love for her was rekindled,&#xD;
and "she was 'once more the ':ruling star ""of his "destiny. His&#xD;
spirits became buoyant with hope; e~nd his prospect ofse-&#xD;
curing the hand of the fair girl of whom he "had" dreamed,&#xD;
and" for whom he had entertained a passion for years, "~s&#xD;
again smiling.&#xD;
He viewed the aberrations of her mind as the result of a&#xD;
temporary" derange~ient caused by her extreme illness, and&#xD;
felt assured that the "cloud "would'soon pass away and leave&#xD;
her thoughts unshadowed. Notwithstanding the kindness of&#xD;
her "manner, and the gentleness cf~her "tones "whenever she&#xD;
spoke 'to him, 'ocCasional outbreaks J6f":ia passion, 'da±k "and&#xD;
fearful, escaped her. Her look and manner 'were "at "times&#xD;
full of "mystery; and the more he "reflected"" on 'the "wildness&#xD;
and strangeness of her words, t~ie~more~he wits perplexed and.&#xD;
"the' deeper were hiym~pathios.&#xD;

a short distance from the house in which Mary lived. He&#xD;
was wondering what had become of all the fishes, and think-&#xD;
ing of Mary by turns. His seat was the root of a free near&#xD;
the margin of the stream, and he waited with all the pa-&#xD;
tience characteristic- of a genuine devotee of the rod for the&#xD;
encouragement of a nibble, endeavoring to satisfy his inquis-&#xD;
itive mind as to the reason why fishes should one day appear&#xD;
to be ferocious with hunger, and the next regardless of the&#xD;
bait which was presented most temptingly to their senses.&#xD;
Above his 'head the bank rose, a few feet, and on it bushes&#xD;
grew most luxuriantly. Along the top of this bank a path&#xD;
wound, leading from the road to ~the bridge thrown across&#xD;
the creek near its mouth.&#xD;
While he sat indulging his speculations, with a face on&#xD;
which' an expression of despondency was gradually thicken~&#xD;
ing, he heard footsteps approaching. Presently the sounds of&#xD;
a voice, as earnest as if engaged in discussing a favorite sub-&#xD;
ject, broke upon him. He listened attentively. The voice&#xD;
was Mary's, and, as soon as she drew near enough to be in-&#xD;
telligible, he heard her say,&#xD;
"Yonder is the place; but he never comes there now. If&#xD;
he would only meet me there, couldn't we have a merry&#xD;
time? But then he won't come here no more, never and&#xD;
never. He don't care for the poor girl he loved. They say&#xD;
that's the way with cruel men: they pluck the rose, and&#xD;
then don't care for the bush they have stripped and left des-&#xD;
olate. Did he laugh at me with his lying mouth? I wish&#xD;
he was hanging up on that tree, that the little birds might&#xD;
come and peck his eyes out."&#xD;
Here she laughed hysterically; and, as Roger listened, his&#xD;
cheek grew pale with wonder and fear. A moment's silence&#xD;
ensued, and then he heard her singing,&#xD;
"They say that he's a gentleman.&#xD;
And that his words are true;&#xD;
But oh! I wish a rope was spun,&#xD;
And that it had its due."&#xD;
Roger listened no longer, but sprang up the bank andwas&#xD;
soon by 'her side, unobserved by her. Her look of wildrwss&#xD;
startled him, and, as he placed his hand on her shoulder,&#xD;
before speaking to her, she shuddered and jumped aside, ex-&#xD;
claiming, "Ugh! he is here !"&#xD;
"What is the matter, Mary r' a~ked Roger, in a low and&#xD;
gentle tone. "It's me-it's only me! Don't look so fright-&#xD;
ened !"&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.                     197&#xD;
She stared insanely at him for a moment without utter- -&#xD;
ing a word, and then, as if just recognizing him, she hung&#xD;
her head, while a blush suffused her cheeks, and tears start-&#xD;
ed to her eyes. He regarded her with a look of intense sym-&#xD;
pathy, and said,&#xD;
"Oh ~ tell me-.....tell me, Mary, what ails you ?"&#xD;
"I've had such strange feelings," she said, becoming more&#xD;
composed, and assuming her usual look and manner. "And&#xD;
oh! I've dreamed such horrible things."&#xD;
It was i~ vain that he tried to get from her what he&#xD;
deemed to be some fearful secret, for, to , all his anxious in-&#xD;
quiries, she returned no other answer than that she had been&#xD;
troubled with strange dreams.&#xD;
He was perplexed to understand how a dream could pro-&#xD;
duce such effects, but his credulous heart yielded up its&#xD;
doubts, and he ascribed her conduct to some momentary il-&#xD;
lusion and became satisfied.. They walked on, and when&#xD;
they reached the bridge, he asked, "And why did you not*&#xD;
marry me, Mary, last winter, as I wanted you to do ?"&#xD;
"I didn't love you enough then," was her reply.&#xD;
"Let us come together as soon as you get entirely well.&#xD;
We can live with your mother, and Colonel Metedith will&#xD;
let me have a piece of~ land, and I can make a very good&#xD;
living off it, I know."&#xD;
Mary shook her head, and her cheek was very pale as&#xD;
she said, "I would consent if it wasn't for one thing."&#xD;
"And what is that, Mary ?"&#xD;
"I can't tell you," she replied. ' She hesitated a moment,&#xD;
and turned her bright eye on him, and added, "Will you do&#xD;
any thing in the world for me, as you said you would a little&#xD;
while ago ?"&#xD;
"Indeed I will," he replied, decidedly.&#xD;
"You wouldn't marry me if you knew all things," she&#xD;
said, in a mournful voice.&#xD;
"I would," he replied.&#xD;
"Swear to me, by this bright creek, that you will help&#xD;
me to do whatever I ask you," she added, with an insane&#xD;
look glaring from her eye, which he had observed when he&#xD;
joined her.&#xD;
"Well, Mary, I do swear it."&#xD;
"I ~m not what you think I am," she said, looking pite-&#xD;
ously in his face. " Will you help me tear his eyes out," she&#xD;
added, wildly, "and then the serpent won't be able to charm&#xD;
any more simple birds."&#xD;

"What do you mean, Miary'?"'&#xD;
She looked mysteriously at 1Pm, and he recoiled, pressed&#xD;
his hand against his: brow, as if some horrible idea~ had just&#xD;
flashed on his. mind, and asked,&#xD;
"Has-has any one-has Hampton~"&#xD;
"Oh yes !" she exclaimed, bursting into tears.; "and if it&#xD;
hadn't been for his. lying tongue, I might have been so happy,&#xD;
for then I'd have been your wife."&#xD;
He could scarcely believe what he heard. He gasped for&#xD;
breath-i-his emotions choked him-ho tore his hair~, and ex-&#xD;
claimed, "I'll~~~bI'il tear his black heart out !"&#xD;
"You mustn't stain your hands-..-.you mustn't kill him-&#xD;
only cut his face up, so he can't delude any more innocent&#xD;
girls with. his smiles., Will you do it for my sake ?"&#xD;
"Yes-yes-.--by my love for you. I'll swear it !" he ex-&#xD;
claimed, brandishing his clinched lists above his head. "I&#xD;
always hated him. He has often insulted me. I always&#xD;
knew he meant you no good. And was he the cause. of your&#xD;
not marrying me?"&#xD;
"Indeed he was. Will you punish him for it? Will you&#xD;
make him look so ugly that nobody will know him ?" she&#xD;
said, laughing hysterically again.&#xD;
"Oh, do not laugh so, Mary !"&#xD;
"Will you cut his face up into little pieces, and pull his&#xD;
eyes out?"&#xD;
Roger nodded assent, and she threw her arms around his&#xD;
neck, and clung to him with a nervous grasp. The wild&#xD;
stare of insanity was bright in her eye. The truth that she&#xD;
was no longer under the guidance of reason flashed on him&#xD;
with overpowering force. Suddenly she withdrew her arms&#xD;
from his neck, sat down on the bridge, and wept profusely.&#xD;
Her sobbing were audible, and, as he listened to them,&#xD;
he stamped his foot violently on the bridge, and vowed most&#xD;
solemnly to avenge the cause of the injured girl.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
ROGER slept but little during the, night, for l~ary's image&#xD;
was continually present to his mind; and h~r wil4 eye, her&#xD;
piteous entreaties, her maniacal laugh, her, burning tears,&#xD;
appealed irresistibly to his sympathies, and caused his heart&#xD;
to swell with' the desire to become her avenger. The more&#xD;
he reflected on Hampton's conduct, the less ~alliat~on he&#xD;
found for it; and when he tliought that by his villainy, tool&#xD;
the prospect of his own' happiness had'been blighted, an ar-&#xD;
dent thirst for revenge 'took possession of him. His slum-&#xD;
bers were short and fitful. Horrible dreams glared on his&#xD;
mind. Mary and her injured, came before him a&#xD;
with the most terrific scenes, in which he himself acted con-&#xD;
spicuously.&#xD;
He rose with the dawn and walked forth. The breeze&#xD;
was soft, and the birds were pouring out their matin melo-&#xD;
dies from every green tree; but his heart heeded uot the&#xD;
gentleness of the one nor the sweetness of the' other. The&#xD;
.only thought which agitated his feelings was the damning&#xD;
injury which had been practiced on the girl he loved, and&#xD;
his only desire was for revenge. He soon met Colonel Mer-&#xD;
edith, and said,&#xD;
"Can I take one oft&#xD;
"Certainl But, he horses, air, and go to town to-day ?"&#xD;
going in que~t of a Roger, what is your errand? Are you&#xD;
doctor? You look pale enough to need&#xD;
the advice of one. Are you sick ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir. I've not been well all night, and, as I'm not&#xD;
fit for work to-day, I thought I might as well go to town and&#xD;
attend to some business I've got there, if you have no objec-&#xD;
tions, sir."&#xD;
"Very. well, Roger, you can go," returned the colonel, re-&#xD;
suming his walk.&#xD;
Not knowing into what perils his enterprise might lead&#xD;
him, and' wishing to be' ready for any emergency, he took&#xD;
from his trunk an old daggcr which had lain useless there&#xD;
for many years, and proceeded to make the necessary prep-&#xD;
arations for his journey. His arrangements were soon com-&#xD;
pleted, and he mounted the horse and rode toward the city&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
with an agitated heart. He left his horse at a livery-stable&#xD;
in the suburbs of the town, and proceeded on foot along the&#xD;
streets. He called at Hampton's office, but did not find him.&#xD;
He took a station in the vicinity, from which he commanded&#xD;
a view of the entrance to the office, and awaited impatiently&#xD;
the approach of the person whom he wished to see. Hour&#xD;
after hour passed by, and yet Hampton came not. At times&#xD;
he thought he recognized his form among the crowds press-&#xD;
ing onward, and his heart leaped with emotion; but, when&#xD;
the individual came near, he Would prove to be a stranger.&#xD;
At length the day wore away, and the stars came forth.&#xD;
Despairing of finding the person he sought, he walked along&#xD;
the streets, scrutinizing every form among the multitudes&#xD;
whom he encountered which bore any resemblance in size&#xD;
to Hampton.&#xD;
The town clock struck the hour of nine as he was passing&#xD;
the "Rising Sun" tavern. Loud voices attracted his atten-&#xD;
tion, and he- stopped and listened. The tones of a voice 'he&#xD;
had frequently heard reached his ear, and his feelings re-&#xD;
vived. The night was sultry, and the doors and windows&#xD;
were all thrown open. He stepped cautiously within-th~&#xD;
door, and beheld a group of a dozen persons gathered about&#xD;
two men who were engaged in an animated controversy on&#xD;
the engrossing political subjects of the day. The loud voices&#xD;
and vehement gestures of the parties betrayed the excited&#xD;
state of their feelings. The lookers..on appeared to be great-&#xD;
ly amused, and when any thing was uttered which 'seemed&#xD;
witty or severe, they laughed boisterously. They evidently&#xD;
belonged to that most estimable class of persons who, in&#xD;
slaking their thirsts for knowledge, do not scorn to drink from&#xD;
streams which are muddled by vulgarity. Had they been&#xD;
at all squeamish, they would not have remained to enlarge&#xD;
the boundaries of their intelligence by what fell 'from the&#xD;
lips of these champions of the respective political parties of&#xD;
the period, as it was impossible to imbibe a drop of informa-&#xD;
tion without, at the same time, swallowing a tolerably co-&#xD;
pious dose of profanity.&#xD;
Roger's heart shrunk back for a moment, as the form of&#xD;
the person he had been seeking all day now stood before him.&#xD;
Hampton cherished some political aspirations, and, as he was&#xD;
fond of showing off his dexterity in the use of the weapons&#xD;
generally employed in political warfare, he never suffered an&#xD;
opportunity to pass unheeded. He had' he~ri drinking deep-&#xD;
ly, and was evidently partially intoxicated. His cheek was&#xD;
&#xD;
flushed, arid his arguments were garnished with the most&#xD;
horribly profane expletives. In his right hand he held a&#xD;
large walking-stick, and, from the free use he made of it, it&#xD;
seemed frequently that he was contemplating the propriety&#xD;
of using it to floor his antagonist, who stood rock-like and&#xD;
immovable, notwithstanding the blended force of passion and&#xD;
logic directed against him. Hampton was a Federali~t in&#xD;
his political views, or, rather, he got his political opinions&#xD;
from the leaders of the Federal party, and he was instru-&#xD;
mental in introducing their opinions into places where, but&#xD;
for him, they in all probability would never have penetrated.&#xD;
His antagonist was a vile-looking Democrat, of small stature,&#xD;
who was called Jim Short. His face indicated the predom-&#xD;
inance of beastly feelings, for in addition to its deep natural&#xD;
marks were some deeper artificial ones, which looked as if&#xD;
he had scraped acquaintance with ~ome cudgel which had&#xD;
left him ineflhceable mementoes of its regard for him. While&#xD;
talking, he was in the habit of casting furtive glances around,&#xD;
as if anxious to read applause in the looks of listeners, or as&#xD;
if he was momentarily expecting a salutation from one of&#xD;
that class of human beings, who are so particularly perplex-&#xD;
ing to gentlemen of his caste, known among men by the des-&#xD;
ignation of constables. To this individual the interests of&#xD;
the great Democratic party were committed on this occasion.&#xD;
Hampton had made some remarks derogatory to the charac-&#xD;
ter of Mr. Jefferson, when Short, taking fire, exclaimed,&#xD;
"I'll swear that's not so. Tom Jefferson is the best and&#xD;
greatest man that ever lived in the tide of time, and that's&#xD;
more than you can say for old Adams, 'whose Federal heart&#xD;
is as hollow as-as-as---"&#xD;
"As your head, if you would have the hollowest thing in&#xD;
the world to compare it to," said Hampton, coming to his&#xD;
antagonist's relief with an illustration which was remarka-&#xD;
ble more for its truth than its courtesy.&#xD;
There was a very fat individual standing near Short, who,&#xD;
oil occasion, could pour forth a perfect cataract of laughter.&#xD;
The fat man gave way to an extraordinary burst of merri-&#xD;
ment, much to Short's annoyance. Casting a malicious&#xD;
glance at the .shaking members of the fat body, Short vo-&#xD;
ciferated,&#xD;
"Whether my head is any follower than some other peo-&#xD;
ple's has nothing to do with this argument. It can tell&#xD;
what's what a little too well for' some folks who think them-&#xD;
selves very knowing for the smallest reason in the world.&#xD;

I 'won't mention names, for fear of being personal," contin-&#xD;
ued the~ furious Democrat, slackening his impetuosity as he&#xD;
djsc&amp;amp;irered a frown darkening his antagonist's brow, and saw&#xD;
his cane moving upward. "Torn Jefferson is. the poor man's&#xD;
friend, but old Adams would grind 'em to the earth."&#xD;
"Jefferson is about as good as common men," said Hamp-&#xD;
ton, relaxingg the rigidity of his expression, "but he is the&#xD;
adv~~te of doctrines which would subvert all law, and in-&#xD;
troduce anarchy into the country."&#xD;
"The man that writ the Declaration of Independence,"&#xD;
bawled Short, "is no fool. But look at old Adams," he con-&#xD;
tinued, connecting his sentences by links of the most i.~nin-&#xD;
telligible remoteness, "how he hates the Ftench! and if it&#xD;
hadn't been for them, we'd all been slaves to the British&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"The French rendered us~ important services," returned&#xD;
Hampton; "but that is no reason why we should sustain&#xD;
them in trampling under foot every thing that is sacred, like&#xD;
a nation of Ostrogoths."&#xD;
"They are not a nation of hogs," returned Short, mistak-&#xD;
ing his antagonist's last word, to the great amusement of&#xD;
one or twO present, who had heard of such barbarians.&#xD;
"They are no hogs, but perfect gentlemen and true patri-&#xD;
ots. If it hadn't been for them, the British would have&#xD;
licked us at the siege of Yorktown."&#xD;
"Would you slander the prowess of your ~wn countrymen,&#xD;
you traitor ?" exclairnedi Hampton, with great indignation.&#xD;
"What do you know of Yorktown, you Tory? Instead of&#xD;
being- there, you were engaged in the more congenial occu-&#xD;
pation of robbing your neighbors' hen-roosts."&#xD;
"That's the blackest kind of a lie !" exclaimed Short,&#xD;
forgetting his prudence and his antagonist's cane. The&#xD;
words were scarcely out of his mouth, when Hampton bran-&#xD;
dished his stick aloft, and aimed a blow at Short's head.&#xD;
But it happened that Jim's instinct of self-preservation was&#xD;
too acute for the contemplated demolition of his head, and,&#xD;
with remarkable dexterity, he sprang out of the door before&#xD;
the cane reached its place of destination; but the blow was&#xD;
not lost on air, for it came down with great force on Jim's&#xD;
constant companion, a large, yellowish, unamiable-looking&#xD;
dog, who yelled and followed hia master with great precip-&#xD;
itancy. In his hurry, he attempted to pass between the.&#xD;
short legs of the fat man, who was laughing vociferously.&#xD;
Instantly that gentleman lost his perpendicularity, and fell&#xD;

having but little sym~pathyw~th the unfortunate, gave vent&#xD;
* to their mirth in the most claniorou~ laughter~ '&#xD;
Hampton's face was the only 'unrelaxed one in the room.&#xD;
He turned toward the bar, and called for a glass of liquor.&#xD;
All this while Roger had been standing in the door, anx-&#xD;
iously awaiting the termination of the' dispute. As soon as&#xD;
the confusion had partially subsided, he walked towar~i&#xD;
Hampton, who had just imbibed his favorite beverage, and,&#xD;
for the purpose of provoking hostilities, said,&#xD;
"It was well for you, Ned Hampton, that it was Short,&#xD;
and not me, that you struck at, for, had it been me, I would&#xD;
have stripped that dandy, coat off your back."&#xD;
"And who are you, sir ?" inquired Hampton, with a look&#xD;
of the most unequivocal contempt, t~oupling his inquiry with&#xD;
an expletive which, with the others he used, the reader's&#xD;
imagination may supply.&#xD;
"A better man than you are," replied Roger, while his&#xD;
eye flashed with hatred, "and one that you kno'~v too well to&#xD;
strike at as you did at Short. And now I'll' tell you who&#xD;
you are; sir: you are a rotten-hearted wretch in the dress&#xD;
of a gentleman! you are a coward! you are a----" and here&#xD;
he placed his lips neai~ his ear, and whispered what was in-&#xD;
audible to the by-st~mders.&#xD;
"Hush'!" exclaimed Hampton, stepping back, and swing-&#xD;
mg his stick in the air.&#xD;
"I'll not hush. I'll tell you, in the presence of all these&#xD;
gentlemen, that you are as great a villain as can be found&#xD;
in or out of the state prison."&#xD;
"One 'word more, and I will break your head or my cane,&#xD;
you lying rascal !" shouted Hampton. "B~one from my&#xD;
presence, sir," he added, in a loud tone, lifting his cane, and&#xD;
loo~dng furiously at Roger, while his lip was' livid ahd trem-&#xD;

"' Strik~, if you dare !" exclaimed Roger, in a menacing'&#xD;
voice; "and, as sure as you are a scoundrel, I'll beat you&#xD;
to a mummy! I'll-"&#xD;
A blow from Hampton's cane put an end to his~ words.&#xD;
It descended with great violence on his head, causing him&#xD;
to stagger across the room. In 'an instant he recovered from&#xD;
it, and ran as fiercely as a tiger toward Hampton, and sprang&#xD;
upon him. A struggle ensued, which was watched with&#xD;
mueli interest by the spectators, who did i~tot attempt to in-&#xD;

the floor, uttering a loud ,and piercing scream. The blood&#xD;
gushQd from his breast, and the spectators crowded round&#xD;
the wounded man, who was lying ~on his back, and writhing&#xD;
in great agony.&#xD;
In the confusion of the moment, the movements of' Roger&#xD;
were nnwatehe4. He passed into the street, and walked&#xD;
rapidly toward the stable where he left his horse. He was&#xD;
soon mounted, and rode off on a gallop in the direction of&#xD;
Oakwood.&#xD;
Hampton was carried into one of the rooms, while some&#xD;
of the company went in pursuit of a doctor, who soon ar-&#xD;
rived, and, after a hasty examination of the wound, pro-&#xD;
nounced it mortal.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
AN hour after the affray, as Drayton and hi~ friend Single-&#xD;
ton were passing the "Rising Sun" tavern, they heard of&#xD;
the scene which had taken place there. They immediately&#xD;
proceeded to the room in which Hampton was lying. The&#xD;
doctor had just finished his examination of the wound as they&#xD;
entered. To their inquiries about the condition of the wound-&#xD;
ed man, he shook his head ominously, indicating thereby&#xD;
that there was no hope of his recovery. The physician re-&#xD;
quested them to remain with him through the night, to which&#xD;
they readily assented. The room was soon cleared, and a&#xD;
short silence ensued, 'during which they had an opportunity&#xD;
of observing HamptQn closely. A solitary lamp threw a sick-&#xD;
ly glare over the apartment, giving to his haggard face an&#xD;
expression of intense agony. The swarthy co~mtenance.......&#xD;
the black hair lying thick and tangled on his forehead-.-.the&#xD;
firmly-knit brows-the parted lips and white teeth, formed&#xD;
a portrait on which it was extremely painful to look. He&#xD;
was lying on a couch, and 'whenever a pang of intense se-&#xD;
verity darted through his system, hp became restless, and ut-&#xD;
tered the most horrible exclamations. As Drayton and his&#xD;

friend stood 'by his side, cI~ending over him with so ~' faces,&#xD;
he glanced' at them, and, with a ghastly smiI~ ~aia,&#xD;
"You are a pretty pair of sjt~tacles! shorten your long&#xD;
faces, or you'll make a fellow feel melau'il~oly. You look&#xD;
like a couple of undertakers ~about to take the dimensions of&#xD;
a dead sinner Laugh, joke, and be merry, if you please,&#xD;
gentlemen."&#xD;
"Who ~was it that struck you ?" inquired Drayton.&#xD;
"Colonel Meredith's man, Roger."&#xD;
Drayton started back from the couch, and looked incredu-&#xD;
lous. Approaching Hampton again, he said,&#xD;
"' And can it be that Roger could be guilty of such a deed?&#xD;
Arc you not mistaken ?"&#xD;
"True as if St. John had spoken it," he replied, in a light&#xD;
and unconcerned tone. "Singleton, my dear fellow, just pull&#xD;
this cursed covering off. I am red hot, and yet that fool of&#xD;
a doctor covers a fellow up as if he wished to give him a&#xD;
foretaste of the atmosphere of Pandemonium. '~&#xD;
Horrified into silence by the levity of the wounded~man,&#xD;
neither Drayton nor Singleton spoke a word. After a short&#xD;
pause, Hampton lifted his head up, and, with his elbow on&#xD;
the pillow, supported it on his hand.&#xD;
"Come at last," he said, grinding his teeth, "and hi such&#xD;
a 'questionable shape,' too! Well, it's just what I had rea-&#xD;
son to expect. It is a miracle my precious life was spared'so&#xD;
long, considering what wild adventures I have shad. It can't&#xD;
be helped, and I'll not cry about it. I have had a jolly life&#xD;
of it, take it altogether-many rare pleasures, and some nar-&#xD;
row escapes-and it is as well that it end in this way as in&#xD;
any other. A very fitting finale to a profligate career, eh!&#xD;
Singleton ?"&#xD;
"Do not talk in that strain, if you please, Hampton," said&#xD;
Singleton~ shocked by what he had heard; "it is sinful."&#xD;
"I might look for a sermon from'such a Puritan as Dray-&#xD;
ton; but from you, Singleton !" said Hampton, looking amazed&#xD;
at him. "Solomon~ Singleton, the jovial Solomon, tt~king&#xD;
about sin with a most becoming and preacher-like face, is&#xD;
strange, mighty strange, it must be confessed! Come hither;&#xD;
Friar Solomon; solemnize thy features, and let me make an&#xD;
edifying confession for my soul's benefit."&#xD;
"'What' provocation did you give the wretch who struck&#xD;
you ?" asked Singleton, wishing to turn the conversation from&#xD;
the direction it had taken.&#xD;
"Enough to justify the blow, I suppose. I played a foul&#xD;

game with his sweet-heart, and he found it out. Before we&#xD;
came to blows, he whispered to me tha~t he knew all, about&#xD;
it, and showed a Very proper resentment~ It is no more than&#xD;
the best of us would do, Singleton, if another should inter-&#xD;
fere between our sweet-hearts and ourselves. I don't blame&#xD;
him, for I've no doubt that I would have done the same&#xD;
thing if I had been in his place. He's got the law on his&#xD;
side, too, I aspectt, for I struck him j~o the earth and snap-&#xD;
ped a pistol at his breast before he wounded me. But then&#xD;
his seeking me with a dagger looks like malice aforethought,&#xD;
doesn't it? That's a matter, however, for you limbs of the&#xD;
law to settle. If he haa only killed me on the spot, I would&#xD;
have forgiven him; but, curse his bungling fist, he only man-&#xD;

"Be more composed, and it will be better for you," said&#xD;
Drayton, who had remained mute for a c6hsiderable time.&#xD;
"If you suffer your feelings to become irritated, your suffer-&#xD;
ing will be more intense."&#xD;
"All that I care about in dying is the pain of it," contin-&#xD;
ued Hampton, apparently not heeding iDrayton's advice,&#xD;
"for I neyer did believe in the tales that people tell us con-&#xD;
cerning the regions below. Man is a brute ; he lives like a&#xD;
brute generally, and he dies like a brute,. as Solomon says;&#xD;
not you, Singleton, but that famous namesake of yours who&#xD;
~njlt the big temple."&#xD;
"For the sake of Heaven, compose yourself," urged Dray-&#xD;
ton; and, as he spoke, he started back, to avoid the intense&#xD;
and vivid glare of the eye which the wounded man fixed&#xD;
upon him.&#xD;
"That i~ kindly meant, I suppose, Drayton; but I crave&#xD;
your pardon if I take my own advice. You certainly would&#xD;
not be so cruel as to stop a man who has got a great deal&#xD;
to say, and but little time to say it in. That fellow's knife&#xD;
only expedited matters a little, for I am wearied of stagger-&#xD;
ing under a cursed load along the path of life, and meant&#xD;
sooi~ to sever the silver cord with m~ own hand. I have&#xD;
exhausted the pleasures and excitements of society, and there&#xD;

Here the doctQr again made his appearance, and, walk.&#xD;

"Ha! ha! that's just whst my friends here have been&#xD;
advising me. Come, my deax doctor, be honest for once in&#xD;
your life, and let me know how long I am to linger with&#xD;
these infernal pains !"&#xD;
"You will die before morning, if you do not compose your-&#xD;
self," returned the doctor, solemnly.&#xD;
"Can't you manage to cut the matter short, doctor?&#xD;
What a melancholy shake that head of yours has! If talk-&#xD;
ing will hurry me off, I swear I'll nQt hush an instant.&#xD;
Come, fellows, clear up those cloudy faces, for I want to die&#xD;
with smiling mouths around me. - There is no use in your&#xD;
looking so grave, for I can not sympathize with your sor-&#xD;

"Lie down, Edward.-lie down, and you will feel much&#xD;
easier," said the doctor, entreatingly.&#xD;
"Excuse .me, if you please, doctor; Ifeel better as I am,"&#xD;
continued Hampton; and his companions, perceiving that&#xD;
he would use his own pleasure, suffered him to talk on with-&#xD;
out further interruption. "I will die as niuch like ~Yespa-&#xD;
sian as I can. Let n~e see; I have not made my will yet.&#xD;
Don't you think I had better go about it, doctor ?" Here he&#xD;
paused, but the' doctor only slwok his head again. "Well,&#xD;
gentlemen," he. continued, "I appoint you ,executors of my&#xD;
last will and testament. Imprimis: I give and bequeath&#xD;

having disposed of all my worldly goods, I believe I am going&#xD;
to die, for my arm is getting so weak that it trembles under&#xD;

his agony was excruciating, and faintly asked for water. A&#xD;
glass was extended to him, which he took, and as he raised&#xD;
it to his lips his eyes roved wildly in their sockets; he gasped,&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
ROGER. did not permit his horse to slacken his pace, but&#xD;
passed along as if his safety depended on his swiftness. His&#xD;
thoughts were singularly disordered. He whipped up his&#xD;
steed as he rode through the woods, and feared to look to&#xD;
the right or left, lest his eye might encounter some fearful&#xD;
specter in the deep shade of the trees. He breathedi more&#xD;
freely again as he emerged from the shadow into the moon-&#xD;
light, but his fancies still' continued to suggest a thousand&#xD;
frightful scenes to his disordered mind. 'As Colonel Mere-*&#xD;
dith's mansion rose on his view in the hazy distance, he felt&#xD;
relieved of some portion of his apprehensions. He checked&#xD;
the speed of his horse as he turned into 'the lane, and re-&#xD;
viewed with more clearness the proceedings of the evening.&#xD;
He had no means of judging of the extent of the wound he&#xD;
had inflicted on Hampton, but his fears suggested the worst&#xD;
effects from it. He shuddered as the thought that it might&#xD;
be mortal flashed before him; then a. series of wild and har-&#xD;
rowing scenes passed with startling vividness before his men-&#xD;
tal vision. First came the prison-then the trial-the con-&#xD;
demnation-the scaffold, and 'the dishonorable grave. He&#xD;
tried to shake off his fears, but that was by no means an&#xD;
easy task. He consoled himself by the reflection that he&#xD;
had acted in self-defense, and that, if Hampton ~e it was&#xD;
no more than he deserved. His conscience acqui ed him of&#xD;
all guilty intentions, as he had designed inflicting only a se-&#xD;
vere castigation on him.&#xD;
It was ten o'clock when he reached Oakwood. Re dis-&#xD;
mounted, turned his horse loose, and proceeded on foot to-&#xD;
ward Mrs. Winters's, to-give an account of wh~t.t had'&#xD;
happened. A black cloud, ~vli he had not prGviou~ly ob-'&#xD;

&#xD;
DRAYTON.                      2Q9&#xD;
served, was lifting its gigantic form above the horizon. It&#xD;
rose and spread itself out with fearful rapidity. The low&#xD;
rumbling of the distant thunder startled him, and he walked&#xD;
on faster. The heavens seemed more frightful than he had&#xD;
ever before known- them, and an undefinable dread seized&#xD;
upon, his soul. The increasing gloom which was darkening&#xD;
over the sky and obscuring the stars seemed like that which&#xD;
was overshadowing his own prospects. When he arrived at&#xD;
Mary's dwelling the lightning were flashing with blinding&#xD;
brilliance, and the light, detached masses of vapor which&#xD;
preceded the storm-cloud had reached and darkened the moon,&#xD;
Which was riding at her highest elevation. The house was&#xD;
as dark as the gathering gloom- overhead; and as he was&#xD;
considering whether it would be proper to call up the Slum-&#xD;
bering inmates, he discovered, by a flash of light, the form&#xD;
of some one robed in white, in the field between the house&#xD;
and the river.&#xD;
His first impression was that he had seen a. spirit,' and a&#xD;
thrill of terror shot along his nerves. His superstitious fears&#xD;
were aroused, and he stood trembling, uncertain whether he&#xD;
should run, or, by 'looking in the direction of the object, con-&#xD;
firm or disprove his impression. The next instant a wild&#xD;
though sweet voice rose over the winds, and as it fell on his&#xD;
ears all doubts as to the source whence it proceeded were&#xD;
dissipated. It sang:&#xD;
"The stars are failed, the night is dark,&#xD;
The storm is gathering o:er my head,&#xD;
And every blast 'That round me sweeps&#xD;
sounds like a summons from the dead.&#xD;
Black though the scene may be without,&#xD;
Yet blacker is my spirit's night,&#xD;
For quench'd in gloom is every thought,&#xD;
And every hope that once gave light."&#xD;
He waited to hear no more. In the. blackness that sur-&#xD;
rounded him, the person from whom the song proceeded was&#xD;
invisible, but, guided by the sounds of he'~r voice, he rushed&#xD;
toward the insane girl with thoughts as crazed as her own.&#xD;
When he reached. the spot from which the voice seemed to&#xD;
come, no one was there; and his heart' beat violently, Tand&#xD;
his brain reeled, as he thoughtthat it was Mary's spirit, and&#xD;
not her corporeal form, which had. attracted his attention.&#xD;
There was a sensation of tightness across his eyes, and his&#xD;
brow seemed to be bound. ery cords as he glanced eager-&#xD;
ly around on the unreveal g scene. The lightning again&#xD;

oarne to his relief, a~d by its glai~e he caught a glimpse of&#xD;
her form as it glided along the path nearthe bank of the&#xD;
creek, where he had last met and parted from her. Swift&#xD;
as thought, he sprang into the path, and rushed toward her.&#xD;
He ~ soou near enough to hear the indistinct murmuring&#xD;
of i~er voice. Again the ligi ning flashed, and, bringingg to&#xD;
her side, he grasped the hand she was swinging violently.&#xD;
"Where, oh where are you going, Mary ?" he inquired,&#xD;
with hurried and faltering accents, scarcely conscious of what&#xD;
he said, owing to the confused state of his~feelings.&#xD;
As his voice greelgd her ears she screamed, and her tones&#xD;
rang far and near on the sweeping winds? A. moment's si-&#xD;
lence ensued, and in a most piteous tone, she said,&#xD;
"Oh, leave me to myself! I never harmed you, nor the&#xD;
bir4~, nor the fLowers. I must go to my. home, indeed I&#xD;
must;" and., thus saying, she disengaged her hand from his&#xD;
grasp.&#xD;
"it i~ me.~-it is me, Mary-your own Roger; and you&#xD;
know .1 wouldn't~ harm you for all the world!"&#xD;
$y the next flash. she obtained a view of his face. In a&#xD;
less agitated voice she said,&#xD;
"What would you seek on such a night as this? Your&#xD;
head would be more comfortable if it pressed its pillow~"&#xD;
And so would yours, Mary."&#xD;
"This is the time. for me to be abroad, with the strong&#xD;
winds and the bats, for my heart is like the sky, so dark that&#xD;
the dear little stars can't peep through."&#xD;
"Not darker than my own," he* returned, with a deep&#xD;
sigh. "I came," he continued, "I came to tell you what has&#xD;
happened. I-I--4 have done it."&#xD;
As he spoke he gasped for breath.- His. words, apparent-&#xD;
ly, were lost on her, for, instead of noticing what he said, she&#xD;
continued to joint upward toward the light clouds which&#xD;
were sailing along in advance of the storm.&#xD;
"1 ~ee his form, and his pale face, and his white shroud,&#xD;
up there," she said, with her face turned up, and pointing&#xD;
with her finger - at the clouds where the moon's light was&#xD;
just discernible among the fragments of v&amp;amp;por. "There!&#xD;
they are carrying him away to his grave, and he won't be-&#xD;
tray ariy more poor, poc~r girls !"&#xD;
"What 4o you see? Who do you see? Whose winding&#xD;
sheet j~ on the cloud ?" he inquired, eagerly.&#xD;
"Why-his face, that used be beautiful, like a cloud&#xD;
when the moonbeams are slee g on it; but the moon ivent&#xD;

&#xD;
~4~TQN.&#xD;
dQwn, and oh, how uglyfr an4. chilly, and black hi~ face w~0&#xD;
then!"&#xD;
"He-he's. not des.d, Mary- !" said Roger, while a si~per-&#xD;
stitious feeling of dread, blended, with faith in. the tri~.th, of&#xD;
what she said, caused him to. tremble.&#xD;
"Didn't I show you hi~ coffin in the~ cloud just now&#xD;
"Where - where - where ?" he exclaimed, anxiously..&#xD;
"He is not dead !"&#xD;
"Why, man, hew strange you talk! Didn't you sa~y you&#xD;
had done it?"&#xD;
'Kl3ut I didn't kill him; I only wounded him, and he will&#xD;
get well again; but he won't harm yeu any more. I met&#xD;
him in the tavern, aid I whipped him, for your sake,"&#xD;
"Did you beat him far- my- sake ?" sho inquired, ~hile a&#xD;
flash of lightning revealed the insane glare pf her eye to him.&#xD;
"Yes, for your sake, Mary""&#xD;
She sprang forward., and, throwing he~ arms around his&#xD;
neck, clung to him with so much force that he could not&#xD;
speak. As he was endeavoring to, unfix her grasp, his hand&#xD;
became visible in the lightning's. flash, and, letting go her-&#xD;
hold, she-jumped from. him, exclaiming,&#xD;
"I saw the red on your hand-it is his blood; and you&#xD;
are a murderer !"&#xD;
"Is there blood on my hand ?" he said, falteringly. "I-..&#xD;
I didn't kill him, Mary !"&#xD;
She made no answer. 'In an instant she deserted him.&#xD;
He looked fearfully around en. the blackness that .enveloped&#xD;
the earth, but could not discover~ her. A terrific crash of&#xD;
thunder shook the ground on which he stood, echoing over&#xD;
the hills, and dying away into a. low rumble among the. far-&#xD;
off clouds. In the agony- of the moment Ihe called loudly arid&#xD;
entreatingly on her name, but to his calls there was no re-&#xD;
ply. Another lurid bolt blazed on high, and by its light he&#xD;
discovered her white. dress fluttering in the gale at- some dis-&#xD;
tance from him. He ran rapidly over the intervening space,&#xD;
and when he again reached her side, he exclaimed,&#xD;
"Oh, do not leave me-do ~ot leave me, Mary, by myself&#xD;
at this horrible time-! Let u~ go home !"&#xD;
"I saw the dark form of Death in that cloud when the&#xD;
lightning flashed," she said, not noticing what he had&#xD;
spoken, "and he- beckoned to me to come to him. He held&#xD;
my shroud in his hand, and it was whiter than the - driven&#xD;
snow, and I'm going to meet him and put it on. There!&#xD;
there's my coffin !'~ she continued, in a phrensied tone, point-&#xD;

ing upward,- as another flash illuminated the frightful scene&#xD;
overhead.&#xD;
The clouds were -rushing with amazing swiftness up to&#xD;
the zenith, while the vivid lightning's crooked bolts darted&#xD;
almost incessantly among them. The thunder, with deaf-&#xD;
ening crash, broke awfully above, following the hissing bolts&#xD;
so quickly as to leave no doubt that the storm was near at&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"Oh, come and go home, Mary !" said Roger, seizing her&#xD;
arm, "for it will rain directly. And then-then, that awful&#xD;
lightning is so near, and it is so frightful! Oh! take my&#xD;
hand, and let me lead you home."&#xD;
As he attempted to grasp her hand, she again sprang&#xD;
a4de and left him alone. By the lightning, he discovered,&#xD;
her standing on the verge of the river's bank, with her white&#xD;
dress flapping violently, and her unbound hair streaming in&#xD;
the tempest that was sweeping furiously over the earth. He&#xD;
ran toward her, but she vanished from his sight. He stood&#xD;
where he saw her a moment before, vainly striving to catch&#xD;
a glimpse of her form through the thick darkness. Another&#xD;
flash lit up earth and cloudy sky, and he discovered her form&#xD;
gliding rapidly down the bank toward the river. Down he&#xD;
leaped, but when his feet touched thQ wave she was not&#xD;
there. ~A moment of agonizing suspense went by, when a&#xD;
piercing scream ros6 over the roaring elements, and was in-&#xD;
stantly followed by a splash in the water.&#xD;
He ran like a phrensied maniac along thee water's edge,&#xD;
calling loudly on her name; but, save the dashing of the&#xD;
waves, no sound came from the bosom of the stream. On-&#xD;
ward came the spirit ~of the storm, bowing the trees and&#xD;
heightening the warfare of the elements. The scene was&#xD;
grand and awful. The rain descended in torrents from the&#xD;
black sky, while the lightning flashed and the thunders roll-&#xD;
ed sublimely overhead. A bolt brighter than all shivered&#xD;
a majestic tree near by, ~nd the frantic Roger left the river&#xD;
and sprang up the bank. A light broke on his eye through&#xD;
the trees, and ii1 great perturbation of feeling, disregarding&#xD;
all obstacles, he ran toward it. In a few minutes he reach-&#xD;
ed the house. Mr: Fleetwood was standing in the door,&#xD;
looking out upon and admiring the grandeur of the storm.&#xD;
He instantly recognized Roger, and exclaimed,&#xD;
"What in the name of aU the devils, boy, ha~ brought you&#xD;
here on such a night as this ?"&#xD;
The shivering Roger made no reply, and, cowering before&#xD;

wept bitterly.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
THE storm raged furiously for an hour. Mr. Fleetwood&#xD;
stood at the door watching its progress, until the moon again&#xD;
shone out, and the black mass of clouds lay piled up against&#xD;
the eastern horizon with their upper edges fringed by the sib&#xD;
very light of the moonbea~is. It was twelve o'clock before&#xD;
he made preparations for retiring, having given no attention&#xD;
to Roger, who retained his position in the chair, with his&#xD;
arms on the top, and his Lace reclining on them. Mr. Fleet-&#xD;
wood approached and tapped him on the shoulder, and he&#xD;
started and looked confusedly up at him. His expression&#xD;
was wild, and the lone man recoiled a step, ~.nd exclaimed,&#xD;
"What ails you? Are you crazy ?"&#xD;
"Oh no !" replied Roger, piteously, and as he spoke he&#xD;
rose. "Is the storm over ?" he continued. "If it is, I'll go&#xD;
home."&#xD;
"A pretty 4ime of night, to be sure, for you to talk of&#xD;
going home. What do you supji~ose Colonel Meredith would&#xD;
say, if he knew you were* wandering about like an uneasy&#xD;
spirit fresh from some scene of horror? It is too wet for you&#xD;
to venture forth to-night. Lie down on that couch, and take&#xD;
a nap. What's the matter with you? You look as if you&#xD;
were frightened out of your senses."&#xD;
"The lightning !" gasped the unfortunate Roger, resum-&#xD;
ing his seat, glad of an opportunity to remain where he&#xD;
was.&#xD;
"The lightning, indeed! Why, boy, did you never see&#xD;
lightning before ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir; but none ever come so near striking me before.&#xD;
I was out on the bank, and it struck the tree near me, and&#xD;
I was never so scared in all my life."&#xD;
"You oughtn't to be afraid of it. What business had you&#xD;
out on the river's bank at such an hour? Were you so bliud&#xD;
and deaf as not to know a storm was gathering ?"&#xD;
He paused a moment, but, as Roger made uc reply, he coma.-&#xD;
tinued,&#xD;

dith to 'send you to an asyhirn. But this is no tirnefoi~;taIk-&#xD;
ing. Double yourself up on that couch, and go to sleep as&#xD;
if you never saw a flash of lightning."&#xD;
He walked into the adjoining room, and Roger threw him-&#xD;
self on the couch. Wearied and exhausted by the excite~&#xD;
ments of the evening, he soon fell asleep. His slumbers&#xD;
were not refreshing, for be frequently started up from hor-&#xD;
rible dreams, with his hair standing erect and his frame&#xD;
shivering with fright. At length his"~nses Were buried in&#xD;
a 'profound slumber, but even then he was restless, groaning&#xD;
and screaming- at times as if he was in deep distress. A.&#xD;
scream louder than all the rest echoed over the silence of&#xD;
the apartment, and roused' Mr. Fleetwood, who came into&#xD;
the rootn with a candle in his hand and a huge cap on his&#xD;
head. He approached the i ouch on which Roger was lying,&#xD;
and, 'holding the candle near the face of the sleeper, leaned&#xD;
over him 'for' 'the purpose of inspecting his 'countenance.&#xD;
Roger~s brow was contracted, 'and his lips were pale and&#xD;
tremulous; 'and 'Mr. Fleetwood could not account for the&#xD;
change Which had come over one Whom he had always con-&#xD;
sidered so amiable on any other supposition than that he was&#xD;
crazy. While he stood watching the expressions which passed&#xD;
over his face, and speculating on their cause, the sleepersud-&#xD;
denly started up with an awful shriek; and, sitting' upright&#xD;
on the couch, ran his fingers through his hair, and stared&#xD;
wildly at the wondering 'Mr. Fle&amp;amp;twood. In a moment he&#xD;
quailed before the stern and astonished looks of 'the old gen-&#xD;
tieman, and, covering his face with his hands, sank down,&#xD;
muttering,.&#xD;
me-spare me! 'oh, don't kill me&#xD;
"Kill you,' boy !" exclaimed Mr. Fleetwood, angrily.&#xD;
"Wh~.t do 'you 'suppose I 'sho4ldwa'ntto kill you for? You&#xD;
are dreaming. YoW are crazy. Go to sleep, and make no&#xD;
more such 'horrid noises, or you mu~t go home, late as it is."&#xD;
"Indeed, sir, it wasn't' my fault I couldn't help it."&#xD;
"Well, you "iifust help 'it, 'or 'leave 'here. How do you&#xD;

Without waiting for 2~ 'reply, 'the old gentleman walked&#xD;
slowlyy out of 'the ~o6m, muttering his anger in under tones&#xD;
Which 'Roger' did not 'understaiid.&#xD;
~Roger Soon 'fell asleepp' again; 'b~it, though 'the iiight, 'his&#xD;

teiied like diam~iids as the beams kissed them. The soft&#xD;
and refreshing breeze of the morning was laden with melody,&#xD;
and the spirit of peace presided over the scene which had&#xD;
been under the 'dominion of the storm during the 'night.&#xD;
He directed his steps toward Mrs. Winters's residence, but&#xD;
when he arrived 'there he found the house deserted, and no&#xD;
one answered his call. With a heavy heart, he passed slowly&#xD;
along the bank of the river. In vain he looked anxiously&#xD;
along its shores; for no trace of 'the girl, who had 'acted so&#xD;
singularly there during the night, met'his view. The bright&#xD;
waves broke on the pebbly shore unmurmuringly, and if 'the&#xD;
river had a secret, it kept it Well. The blue sky-the un-&#xD;
ruffled river-4he green island-the gentle wind-and the&#xD;
melody of birds and insects rejoicing in the beam and the&#xD;
breeze of early' mining, form4~d a vivid contrast, to the gloom&#xD;
and the sadness which oppressed his heart. He sighed heav-&#xD;
ily, and then turned and walked slowly and sadly toward&#xD;
O'akwood. 'As he approached the mansion, he discovered&#xD;
Colonel Meredith standing 'on the porch engaged in an earn-&#xD;
est conversation with Mrs. Winters. As soon as the old&#xD;
woman saw Roger, she called on him, 'with agony in look&#xD;
and tone, 'to tell her what had becOme of her daughter.&#xD;
,At 'that moixient two men rode up and dismounted. They&#xD;
approached Roger, who, recognizing One of them to be a&#xD;
constable from the city, 'turned and ran toward the river.&#xD;
They quickened their pace, and 'pursued him. He passed&#xD;
rapidly along the 'bank until he caine opposite 'a~boat. He&#xD;
sprang to 'the water's edge, and, grasping a pole which lay&#xD;
on the shore, jumped into 'the boat and pushed her out 'into&#xD;
the 'stream.&#xD;
Whenhis pursuers reached the bank 'and 'saw how he had&#xD;
'escaped them, their faces betokened great disappointment.&#xD;
Glancing along~the shore, they 'perceived a boat with oars,&#xD;
in which someone had just crossed the riVer. They were&#xD;
soon in possession of it, but not until Roger Was a consider-&#xD;
able distance from the s~iore. He moved slowly, 'having&#xD;
nothing but the 'pole with Which to propel 'his boat, while&#xD;
the 'offlce~s pli~d their oars briskly and gained rapidly on&#xD;
him. Seeing '.th'at 'escape was ii~possible, 'he elevated his&#xD;
pole, 'and, with~a threateninglook, 'shouted,&#xD;
"The first 'i~iiai~ 'th&amp;amp;t"touches this boat will catch this on&#xD;
his head."&#xD;
"Don't be so courageous, young man," returned one of&#xD;
&#xD;

th~ 'officers; "in spite of all the poles in the world, and all&#xD;
other means of defense which you doubtless have' secreted&#xD;
about your person in defiance of the b~w of the land, we will&#xD;
discharge our duty, which is tQ sei the body of Roger&#xD;
Brown, and convey him to the city, where he stands charged&#xD;
with the murder of Edward Hampton. So the better you&#xD;
behave yourself, young man, the kinder you will be to your-&#xD;
self, for take you we will."&#xD;
This elaborate style of address, together with the solem-&#xD;
nity of the officer's manneri~, caused Roger to turn pale.&#xD;
When he concluded, Roger swung his pole about more fierce.~&#xD;
lythan before, and exclaimed, "You lie; I'm not a murderer !"&#xD;
"Well, then, surrender yourself, and you will not be&#xD;
harmed; but, if you resist, it is 'possible that this weapon&#xD;
will make you as gentle as a lamb ;"' and4 as he spoke, he&#xD;
produced a large and murderous-looking pistol, and pointed&#xD;
it threateningly at Roger.&#xD;
"Shoot that thing off at me," returned Roger, "and, if&#xD;
you miss, you must look out for breakers. I azn~no murderer !"&#xD;
"Roger, my old friend, that won't do now," said the youn..&#xD;
g~r of the two officers, who was the proprietor of a face whose&#xD;
jocularity and good nature by no means indicated the skill&#xD;
he possessed in ferreting out offenders against the laws of&#xD;
the commonwealth. "That story don't fit your conduct no&#xD;
better than a shirt does a bean-pole. You run as if you&#xD;
weren't guilty, didn't you? I'm an old 'possum catcher, and&#xD;
am up to all sorts of trickery."&#xD;
"Jim Smith, you knc~w me, and you'd better not trifle&#xD;
with me," said Roger, with determination in his eye, and a&#xD;
feeling of desperation in his breast.&#xD;
"Come, Roger, surrender yourself, and, if you're the in-&#xD;
nocent man you say you are, there'll not be a hair of your&#xD;
head harmed," paid Smith, coaxinglyy, at the same time&#xD;
grasping the side of the boat.&#xD;
"Let go this boat, Jim, or, as sure as your beard's black,&#xD;
I'll loosen your hold."&#xD;
Smith let go of the boat, and, elevating himself, sprang&#xD;
into her, and was in the act of seizing Roger, when his foot&#xD;
slipped and his form balanced over her side. The weight&#xD;
of the pole, which Roger placed on his shoulder, determined&#xD;
the preponderance of his body in favor of the river, and he&#xD;
plunged in. While his colleague was endeavoring to rescue&#xD;
him, Roger pushed his boat oW and by the time the dripping~&#xD;
form of Sufith was out of the water, he was some distance&#xD;

off. Smith's companion again presented his pistol, and swore&#xD;
he would shoot him if he offered any further resistance.&#xD;
They were soon alongside the second time, and Smith again&#xD;
stepped into Roger's boat, and, placing his hand on Roger's&#xD;
shoulder, claimed him as a prisoner. As the boats approach-&#xD;
ed the shore they had left, Smith took a deliberate survey&#xD;
of his person, and remarked,&#xD;
"Don't you know it's against the law to knock an officer&#xD;
of the peace overboard when he is performing his duty? If&#xD;
it wasn't that you're an old friend, I'd make. you smart for&#xD;
it. Just look at me, sir !" he continued, extending both arms&#xD;
at full length; "just look at me, sir! Ain't L a pretty pic-&#xD;
ture to behold? If it 1~iad been a cold morning, that infer-&#xD;
nal ducking might liave been the death of me."&#xD;
The eldeii officer smiled at his comrade, while Roger, sit-&#xD;
ting in the stern of the boat, leaned his face forward on his&#xD;
knee, and said not a word. The shore was soon reached,&#xD;
and Colonel Meredith, who had been standing on the bank&#xD;
watching the whole proceeding with anxiety and surprise,&#xD;
came forward and asked an explanation. Roger wept while&#xD;
he told him every thing in relation to it, and the colonel was&#xD;
visibly and deeply affected by his narration. He felt that&#xD;
Roger had told him the wh~Ae truth, and that Hampton's&#xD;
death was the result of accident rather than evil intention.&#xD;
He accompanied the officers to the city, where Roger&#xD;
underwent an examination, and was commit d to prison.&#xD;
Hampton's untimely death caused great excitement in the&#xD;
community, and many and discordant were the rumors which&#xD;
were soon in circulation touching the circumstances which&#xD;
led to it. In the course of the morning, Colonel~ Meredith&#xD;
called on Drayton, who related to him all that Hampton had&#xD;
said of the affray which terminated so fatally. They went&#xD;
to the prison, and from Roger learned every thing in reference&#xD;
to the melancholy event; and Drayton, at the suggestion of&#xD;
Colonel Meredith, concluded to defend him.&#xD;
The river did give up its secret, and Mary Winters's body&#xD;
was found during the day. The agony of her widowed and&#xD;
now childless' mother was of the intensest kind, and deeply&#xD;
affected all who witnessed it. ~ Roger's description of the last&#xD;
moments of the brief and melancholy career of that beautiful&#xD;
victim of human wrong was not doubted. Her history is&#xD;
still told in the neighborhood in which she .resided, and is&#xD;
often pointed to as a warning to those of her dass who aspire&#xD;
to unite themselves with 'persons of a higher social position.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXYI.&#xD;
ThE disaster by which George Meredith had been im-&#xD;
mersed in the river was followed by consequences of a much&#xD;
more serious nature than were at first apprehended. His&#xD;
system was toor feeble to recover immediately from such a&#xD;
shock.. It is true that, after a short confinement to the house,&#xD;
he reappeared 'among the scenes he was so fond~6f; but a&#xD;
deep and stubborn cough continued to afflict him, causing&#xD;
his friends much alarm. He, however, manifested but little&#xD;
fear, and still expressed himself in terms scarcely less san-&#xD;
guine than he had been accustomed to use of late, when&#xD;
speaking of the probabilities of his entire restoration to&#xD;
health. He could not, however, conceal from his 'own heart&#xD;
the conviction that his fragile form had received a shock&#xD;
which would probably prove fatal. The hopes which had&#xD;
sprang into being under the influence of his love for Miss&#xD;
Randolph, day by day parted with their brilliance. Yet he&#xD;
did not give way to gloom. lie expressed no fears. He&#xD;
~seemed to be as buoyant in spirit as he had been prior to his&#xD;
misfortune. Often, when alone, in his communing with his&#xD;
own heart, the prospect of an early death came before him&#xD;
with more force than it had since Miss Randolph's return.&#xD;
The tears often glistened in his eyes when dwelling on the&#xD;
hard necessity which threatened to frustrate all his plans' of&#xD;
happiness. It was not the fear of encountering the gloom&#xD;
of the grave that oppressed him; b~~t' it was hard for him to&#xD;
relinquish all the delights which he had so often 'anticipated&#xD;
from his union with the loved and devoted Caroline. To&#xD;
abandon a prospect so full of bliss just on the eve of its 'ful-&#xD;
fillment, was a thought against which even his well-dis-&#xD;
ciplined mind was not proof, and his smitten sensibility&#xD;
craved relief in tears, despite all his strong efforts to the con-&#xD;
trary. 'Still he was cheerful, and the most searching pene-&#xD;
tration would have been baffled in its endeavors to discover&#xD;
the abiding thought which shaded so many of his solitary&#xD;
hours.&#xD;
It is a sad spectacle, under any circumstances, to witness&#xD;
the gradual decay of one who is dear to us; but wjien that&#xD;
&#xD;
xi&#xD;
&#xD;
one is young, and possessed of all the moral and intellectual&#xD;
qualities necessary to render existence lovely and useful, the&#xD;
spectacle is peculiarly distressing. To sit by the side of ~ne&#xD;
thus singled out, with the conviction that h~ must soon be&#xD;
withdrawn beyond the reach of human syrnpathies..-.to list-&#xD;
en to his faltering acceptss, weak in the utterance of the love&#xD;
which is still yearning at his heart-to see the pale brow&#xD;
and the wasted cheek, on which the fatal hectic blooms like&#xD;
the rosy flush on the evening cloud, telling that the night&#xD;
comet apace-to mark the unnatural light which flashes&#xD;
and flickers in the eye on which is gradually stealing and&#xD;
deepening the shadow of the grave-to feel the heart to be&#xD;
almost bursting With its hoarded grief, and to choke the ex-&#xD;
pression which .rise§ to the eye for the sake of the dear in-&#xD;
valid, is inexpressibly mournful, as many can attest. Oh!&#xD;
thou pure and gentle spirit, who hast bended from thy bright&#xD;
inheritance on high, and art hovering like a palpable pres-&#xD;
ence~nea~ me at this moment-thou who hast suffered deep-&#xD;
ly, and art now released-whose calm and thoughtful brow&#xD;
now wears a crown of unfading glory\ beyond the shadows&#xD;
of time-whose stricken and wasted form now reposes, un-&#xD;
conscious of the bird and the breeze making melody above&#xD;
it-~on whose subsiding pulses I hung, while grief muffled&#xD;
up my spirit, and my eye longed to shed its tributary tears,&#xD;
how vividly comes over ~xne, at this moment, the recollection&#xD;
of all that thou wast and all that I felt while lingering near&#xD;
thy fleshless form, on which insidious disease preyed so long&#xD;
and so fatally! What though my tongue may not confess&#xD;
it to others, thou knowest how often, when alone and silent-&#xD;
ly communing with my own heart, the thoughts of other&#xD;
days and of thee come over me with a power which I can&#xD;
not and would not resist! I Would not bury my bleedii~g&#xD;
sensibility in the grave with thee, for oh! though melan-&#xD;
choly the thought that we may meet no more amid the blend-&#xD;
ing of light and shade which greets me here, it is still a pleas-&#xD;
ing task to summon back from, the records of by-gone years&#xD;
the thousand endeared scenes in which thou '~vast a conspic-&#xD;
uous actor, when thy pulses were as buoyant as those of the&#xD;
heart which would here imprint a perishable evidence of its&#xD;
imperishable love for thee. How often does~ny mem~i'y seek&#xD;
the sequestered spot where they placed thee when thy day&#xD;
of weary travel was spent! and while there bending, like a&#xD;
stricken mourner, over the turf wheze thou liest, it looks'foud-&#xD;
ly up at the heaven where duster many stars, but sees no&#xD;

one which shines with a purer, steadier, and more burning&#xD;
hz~ter than that associated with thee.&#xD;
To sit and watch lifer's taper gradually fainting away was&#xD;
now the melancholy &amp;amp;ffice of Ellen Meredith. Her broth-&#xD;
er's symptoms assumed a positive character, a~nd boded a&#xD;
speedy termination of his lease on existence. Da/ly and hour-&#xD;
ly she was near him, ministering to his wants *~h all that&#xD;
devotion and sympathy which are peculiar to her sex. She&#xD;
often read to him from some favorite volume, stopping to list-&#xD;
en to his remarks, which always indicated-what is so un-&#xD;
usual-a profound insight into the meaning of the author,&#xD;
Frequent and prolonged were the walks and rides they took&#xD;
together; and on such occasions the eye of the invalid would&#xD;
brighten before the beauties bursting on his sight, and his&#xD;
tones grow enthusiastic while expressing the deep-stated&#xD;
love his heart cherished for every thing lovely in Nature's&#xD;
Works. It was always a melancholy task for the devoted&#xD;
sister to assume a cheerfulness she did not feel, when dwell-&#xD;
ing on the vivid expression of her brother's face, for she knew&#xD;
any manifestation of the grief she felt would give him acute&#xD;
pain. The thought was ever present to her that his face&#xD;
would ere long be 'eclipsed in the shadow of the grave, and&#xD;
that the tones of his voice, as musical and aS unearthly as&#xD;
the strains of the spirit-bird, which, in Indian fable, hymns&#xD;
a mournful requiem over the moldering form of the departed&#xD;
warrior, would soon be hushed in the unbreaking silence of&#xD;
death.&#xD;
Nor were the attentions of her with whom he had hoped&#xD;
to link his earthly fortunes less touching and devoted. Car-&#xD;
oline spent much of her time at Oakwood, watching with&#xD;
intense anxiety every change for the better or the worse&#xD;
which took place in her lover'a disease. She still clung&#xD;
'with a strong tenacity to the fragments of the shattered&#xD;
hope which promised her that he would live to bless her&#xD;
love and reward her unshrinking devotion.&#xD;
To contemplate a spectacle as lovely as was presented by&#xD;
* these two young ladies, so beautiful and so lavishly gifted&#xD;
with the means of winning the wa.rmes.t plaudits of an ad-&#xD;
miring world, forsaking all opposing desires, even in thought,&#xD;
that they might devote themselves continually to the neces-&#xD;
sities of the invalid whom they loved, migh'L teach those&#xD;
slanderers of all that is pure and disinterested in human na-&#xD;
ture that there is much unalloyed good on earth, and that&#xD;
the reason why they know it not is that their associations&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
221&#xD;
&#xD;
are not among the noble and the saint-like. Devoted even&#xD;
to self-sacrifice, they lingered by the side of George; and&#xD;
if, by yielding up either of their lives, his could have been&#xD;
prolonged, years would have gone' by before the summons&#xD;
which calls mortals from the perishable things of time would&#xD;
have sounded through the depths of his soul.&#xD;
During the afternoon of ~t. most bright day~ George was&#xD;
reclining on a seat in the porch, viewing the reapers in a&#xD;
field at a short distance, and taking note of every sound which&#xD;
rang over the landscape. His cheek was much wasted, his&#xD;
eye was sunken, and, his noble brow was very pale. The&#xD;
wind, as it went by laden, with fragrance and with song,&#xD;
gently lifted the auburn locks which clustered on his fore-&#xD;
head. There was neither the shadow of a gloomy spirit nor&#xD;
the radiance of a hoping heart in his countenance. A feel-&#xD;
ing of resignation was reposing softly on his features, not-&#xD;
withstanding he was thinking of the probability th5gt but few&#xD;
more such days would shed their benign influences on his&#xD;
head. A smile passed over his lips as the ever-welcome&#xD;
forms 'of Ellen and Caroline drew near him. As they were&#xD;
taking their seats, a brilliant bird flew into a tree immedi-&#xD;
ately in front of them, and poured forth a gush of glorious&#xD;
melody.&#xD;
"What exquisite music that little warbler pours forth on&#xD;
the air, without knowing the value of his own rich strains,"&#xD;
said George. "He is like an uncultivated 'son of song among&#xD;
a rude people, who gives utterance to the wild melody of&#xD;
his heart, unconscious of its sweetness and merit."&#xD;
"Do you remember, brother," remarked iRllen, "when&#xD;
we were at the South, how the mocking-birds would come&#xD;
on moonlight nights, and sit near our windows and sing!&#xD;
Oh! many a bright dream did the songs of those sweet birds&#xD;
call up before my slumbering mind! At times my visions&#xD;
were of a glorious future, and scene after scene, as beautiful&#xD;
and as fleeting 'as the pictures that fancy paints on the even-&#xD;
ing sky, would rise before me, and, after enjoying them a&#xD;
while, I awoke, and found that the enchanter, whose spell&#xD;
was upon me, was a bird near my lattice. At other times&#xD;
my heart luxuriated in the pleasures of my early years, and&#xD;
I was once more a wild and enthusiastic girl, sporting among&#xD;
the flowers with the companions I loved."&#xD;
'- "In some sections of the world," said George, "the song&#xD;
of a bird rising on the silence of night is'supposed tQ be the&#xD;
voice of a lost friend revisiting the scenes he was once fa-&#xD;

miliar with, and hymning the delights of the better clime,&#xD;
of which he is now a blessed inhabitant, in. the ears of those&#xD;
he loved while living. I do not wonder that the supersti-&#xD;
lion of a poetical mind should weave so beautiful a fiction&#xD;
under such circumstances; for such is the sweetness of a&#xD;
bird's song when heard by a half slumbering ear in the&#xD;
depths of the night, that the excited fancy can easily im-&#xD;
agine its strains to. be the melodious hymn of a. departed&#xD;
friend breathing peace to the soul from which death could&#xD;
not sever its mysterious sympathies~ Let cold philosophy&#xD;
deride such beautiful imaginings as much as it may, the pop-&#xD;
ular heart will always have credulity enough to believe&#xD;
them. I confess I would not sever my faith from all the&#xD;
fictions of superstition for all the abstractions of logic that&#xD;
can be addressed to my understanding. Philosophy discours-&#xD;
es its learned sentences only to the mind, while Supersti-&#xD;
tion utters her sweet voices in the depths of the soul, and we&#xD;
cling to them with an earnestness which no uncheering ab-&#xD;
straction of the Stoic's creed can~ arouse."&#xD;
"A friend," observed Caroline, whose eager ear had been&#xD;
drinking in the low and spirit-like tones of her lover's voice,&#xD;
"a friend told me lately of a very pretty and poetical inci-&#xD;
dent. A young lady, who owned a beautiful ring-dove,&#xD;
which appeared to be much attached to her, sickened and&#xD;
died, and a broken shaft was placed over her grave. Some&#xD;
mysterious instinct led thin bird to the grave of its mistress,&#xD;
and it was frequently to be seen sitting on the column, as&#xD;
if mourning the loss of the on~ most dear to it. There was&#xD;
an example of devotion to the memory of a loved and lost&#xD;
friend worthy of the truest human heart."&#xD;
"The incident is a beautiful one, Caroline," said George;&#xD;
and, as he spoke, the gushing melody of the bird, already re-&#xD;
ferred to, again attracted his attention. "How little," he&#xD;
continued, after a momentary pause, "how little do many&#xD;
seem to know of the sources of happiness which the Su-&#xD;
preme Architeet has spread with a lavish hand around them.&#xD;
Here, in His own beautiful temple, surrounded with innu-&#xD;
merable splendors, from which an eternal anthem is rising&#xD;
like incense to his throne, andi where one would suppose no&#xD;
eye could be so blind as~ not to see, and no ear so deaf as&#xD;
not to hear, the majority of persons drag out their existences&#xD;
with less apparent sensibility than the fowl and the brute,&#xD;
which ~sport through their short days and perish."&#xD;
" How singular it is that such should be the case, and yet&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
how many instances of entire indifference to the beauties of&#xD;
nature do we observe around us," remarked Ellen, with a&#xD;
very thoughtful brow.&#xD;
"Every community contains many such specimens," con-&#xD;
tinued George. "There are thousands in yonder city who&#xD;
bend all their energies to the accumulation of wealth, which,&#xD;
when acquired, affords them nothing but the selfish pleas-.&#xD;
ure of knowing that they possess it. In youth they neglect&#xD;
the cultivation of their minds and hearts, and when they&#xD;
have reached the end for ~which they have striven so anx-&#xD;
iously, and opulence is theirs,, they find themselves bank-&#xD;
rupt in the means of enjoying it. For my part, as I ~onsid-&#xD;
er the pleasures of the heart superior to the sensual ones&#xD;
which wealth can procure, I had rather earn my bread by&#xD;
the sweat of my brow, and enjoy the continual and unpall-&#xD;
ing ~banquets which nature offers tlw~ refined sensibility,&#xD;
than, being destitute of a taste fot' the glories which meet&#xD;
the eye in all directions, revel in all the inane pomps and&#xD;
luxuries which vitiate the feelings, and can not satisfy the&#xD;
yearnings of the soul. I had rather have a crust of bread&#xD;
where I can drink in the melodies that float on every breeze,&#xD;
than feast at the sumptuous tables where ambition, avarice,&#xD;
and vanity grow voluble when rehearsing their own achieve-&#xD;
ments."&#xD;
"If persons would only cultivate a variety of tastes," said&#xD;
Ellen, "they would be less dependent on fortune, and, un~&#xD;
der all the changes of life, have the means of enjoying them.&#xD;
selves.~~&#xD;
"True," said George, earnestly; "it is a great and very&#xD;
common error to devote life to one pursuit. Love~ ambi-&#xD;
tion, fortune, should alike receive attention. In youth we&#xD;
should cultivate the tastes which will smooth life's declining&#xD;
years. The beaver, the bee, the ant provide during the sum-&#xD;
mer for the wants of winter; and man, imitating their ex-&#xD;
amples, should not only provide himself with what will sup-&#xD;
port life when old age comes upon him, but also with the&#xD;
means of rendering existence useful and pleasant. Knowl-&#xD;
edge should be- sedulously sought after in youth, for it affords&#xD;
the richest solace when the head is hoary and. the sluggish&#xD;
blood crawls lazily through the veins.&#xD;
"I was reading the other day the accounts whici~ those&#xD;
great historians, Hume and Gil.ibon, give of themselves," said&#xD;
Caroline, "and could not but feel the truth of what th~y say&#xD;

all their time in accumulating wealth, seeing that, without&#xD;
knowledge, the wealth, when gained, can not purchase a tat.&#xD;
isman to summon up comforts and contentment to the heart."&#xD;
"Those are cheering testimonies to the pleasures of the&#xD;
scholar's life," said George. "You remember what Gibbon&#xD;
says in reference to the statements which Buffon, Fontenelle,&#xD;
and Voltaire give of the pleasures of old age. They thought&#xD;
it the m,,ost delightful period of life, for then, when the fire&#xD;
of the passions is abated, those calm and elevating medita-&#xD;
tions which make men wise can be indulged in without re-&#xD;
straint. Such testimonies~ to the pleasures of intelligent old&#xD;
age and the pleasures of knowledge are as invaluable as&#xD;
they are imperishable. A clear conscience, a comfortable&#xD;
subsistence, a relish for reading, and the power to reflect,&#xD;
make the wintery season of life not only tolerable, but de-&#xD;
lightful. How differently we feel when contemplating an&#xD;
61d man possessed of such means of dignifying himself, than&#xD;
when we look up~n the paralytic devotee of Mammon, press-&#xD;
ing toward the grave with faltering steps and averted eyes,&#xD;
hugging his gold to his heart, and still eager to accumulate.&#xD;
Old age, under the one aspect, is as venerable as under the&#xD;
other it is revolting."&#xD;
"Do you think that every one could taki~ the same pleas-&#xD;
ure in the acquisition and the uSe of knowledge ?" inquired&#xD;
Caroline. "I have seen many individuals so entirely destP&#xD;
tute of the desire to know, that I have thought they were&#xD;
born with imperfectly-constituted minds."&#xD;
"There are many who are entirely regardless of the value&#xD;
of intelligent minds," returned George, "and it may be&#xD;
that this results from some natural infirmity. It is proba-&#xD;
ble that some are so peculiarly organized that a love for&#xD;
books and the sublime Volume of creation, in which the&#xD;
Deity has blazoned forth the shadows of his wisdom and be-&#xD;
nevolence, is beyond the reach of their souls. But I am con-&#xD;
vinced that this is the case with but few, and that the vast&#xD;
majority could, if they would, relish knowledge of all kinds.&#xD;
And knowledge, once imparted to the mind, would not be&#xD;
given up for all the wealth of the Indies, to use Gibbon's&#xD;
expression."&#xD;
The approach of some one, whom they soon recognized to&#xD;
be Drayton, arrested their conversation at this point. He&#xD;
joined them apparently much to the pleasure of all parties.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
THE political excitement of the period under consideration&#xD;
was intense. The election of the highest officers known&#xD;
under our government was approaching. The Republican&#xD;
and Federal parties were~arrayed in hostile attitudes to each&#xD;
other, mutually asserting their own purity and denouncing&#xD;
the views of their opponents. The political sea was angry&#xD;
with strife, and many good and true patriots feared' much&#xD;
for the safety of the ship of state. Each party battled vig-&#xD;
orously, and each was confident that victory would perch on&#xD;
its banners. Father arrayed against son, brother against&#xD;
brother, and the waves of discord beating violently against&#xD;
the holiest relations of society, presented a spectacle well&#xD;
calculated to rouse the, alarm of many who had fought for&#xD;
the freedom which now appearedd to be placed in such fear-&#xD;
ful jeopardy. Each party contended for what it considered&#xD;
to be of the last importance to the well-being of the country;&#xD;
and each was sincere in the belief that, if the antagonistic&#xD;
party triumphed, the liberties of the nation would be endan-&#xD;
gered. The Democrats asserted that if Federalism came off&#xD;
victor, the government would assume a monarchical charac-&#xD;
ter; while the Federalist declared that if Democracy achieved&#xD;
the rule, the elements of disorder would be let loose, law&#xD;
would not be respected, and anarchy, similar to that which&#xD;
had recently deluged France with the blood of many of her&#xD;
noblest citizens, would. inevitably ensue. Time, the falsifier&#xD;
of the predictions of heated minds, has disproved the fears&#xD;
which were entertained with reference to the triumph of the&#xD;
successful party; and all now agree that both parties were&#xD;
equally honest, and that each was wrong in charging bad&#xD;
designs on' those who differed from it in opinion.&#xD;
Drayton was not an unmoved spectator of events, lie&#xD;
loved his native land, and reverenced her institutions, and&#xD;
was deeply interested in the struggle which was then going&#xD;
on, for he, too, thought the welfare of the country depended&#xD;
on its issue. By education and from conviction, he was in-&#xD;
duced to regard the Federalists as contending for measures&#xD;
at war with the 4ghts of the people; and he opposed them&#xD;
from a sense of duty firmly and honestly. Many of his most&#xD;

&#xD;
respected friends belonged to that party, and, though he could&#xD;
not doubt their patriotism, he believed that if the Federalists&#xD;
succeeded, it would be at the expense of popular liberty;&#xD;
and, regarding devotion to his country as the first political&#xD;
duty of an American citizen, he expressed his opinions freely&#xD;
and fearlessly.&#xD;
He continued to experience all that sickness~ of the heart&#xD;
which is consequent on long-sustained and unrealized expect-&#xD;
ations. Day after day, and weary month after month, he&#xD;
repaired ~o his office, and still no business came to' cheer him&#xD;
with the prospect of a more successful period. At times he&#xD;
thought of yielding to the feeling of despair that oppressed&#xD;
him, and of changing his location; but his pride revolted at&#xD;
the thought when he recollected his resolution of rebuilding&#xD;
his family name oii the spot which had witnessed its down-&#xD;
fall. Since Roger's imprisonment, he had been looking for-&#xD;
ward anxiously to the period of his trial. On that occasion&#xD;
he was to make his first effort at the bar, and he was pre-&#xD;
paring himself against the possibility of a failure by the most&#xD;
unwearying study.&#xD;
While waiting for business, he had employed many of his&#xD;
leisure hours in the composition of a series of articles on the&#xD;
condition and policy of the government, which were published&#xD;
in the Democratic .journal of the city. These articles com-&#xD;
manded much attention, for they exhibited signal ability, and&#xD;
manifested a deep insight inte the nature of the contest then&#xD;
waging, and were evidentlythe results of much and profound&#xD;
reflection. The secret of their authorship was confided to a&#xD;
few friends; and Drayton was gratified in knowing that the&#xD;
emanations of his pen had been ascribed to' some of the sound-&#xD;
est and most distinguished men in the community.&#xD;
One evening his friend Singleton, who was' a Democrat&#xD;
and a popular m'an, called on him, and insisted on his accom-&#xD;
panying him to a political meeting. Singleton was a warm-&#xD;
hearted man, and took' a deep interest in Drayton's success.&#xD;
He had often expressed a desire that Drayton should make&#xD;
himself known as a speaker in the primary assemblages of the&#xD;
people, to which Drayton had uniformly objected. On this&#xD;
occasion, however,~ his objections were less earnest than usual,&#xD;
and he went with his friend to the place of meeting. When&#xD;
they arrived, they found a large crowd collected~, listening to&#xD;
one of the popub~r orators. When he concluded his speech,&#xD;
the cr&amp;amp;wd became clamorous for mere eloquence, and "Sin-&#xD;
gleton-Singleton !" was shouted from every mouth present.&#xD;
&#xD;

Singleton obeyed the call and rose, and, after a few re-&#xD;
marks, observed that there was a friend of his present who&#xD;
would undoubtedly respond to their wishes if' called upon.&#xD;
As soon. as he mentioned Drayton's name, the room resound-&#xD;
ed with its echoes. Escape being impossible, Drayton rose&#xD;
with th~ intention of making ait apology rather than a&#xD;
speech. The lights shone but dimly over the dark mass of&#xD;
beings before him, and his eye wavered with the agitation&#xD;
of his feelings as it wandered over the apartment. In a,&#xD;
moment ~after, he ascended the stand; every murmur was&#xD;
hushed, and his trepidation at finding himself in so unex-&#xD;
pected and so trying a situation for a moment unmanned&#xD;
him. He stood, not knowing what to say, elevated conspic-&#xD;
uously above all others, with an eager multitude pressing&#xD;
forward, anxious to hear him. It was a critical moment.&#xD;
The crowd manifested considerable uneasiness, and some&#xD;
smiled at. his expense. Drayton observed smiles on some&#xD;
faces near him, and the idea of the ridiculousness of his sit-&#xD;
uation shot with electric force and vividness across his con-&#xD;
fused mind. In the desperation of the moment, he com-&#xD;
menced, not knowing what he said. A few faltering and&#xD;
unconnected words fell from his lips, and he again hesitated.&#xD;
He was about abandoning the stand, when a remark, which&#xD;
cut him severely, reached his ear. It irritated him deeply.&#xD;
His cheek burned with anger. His dark eye flashed with&#xD;
passion. With a strong effort, he summoned up the scattered&#xD;
forces of his intellect, and recommended. Gradually his tones&#xD;
became deeper and firmer, and his sentences more exact.&#xD;
Confidence returned to him-he, grew warm and excited with&#xD;
his subject; and a torrent of most eloquent declama±ic~n burst&#xD;
from his lips. The crowd shouted applause, and bent forward&#xD;
to catch every word he uttered. He felt cheered, and pro-&#xD;
ceeded with the most decided success. At the end of &amp;amp;n&#xD;
hour he left the stand, amid the most deafening plaudits.&#xD;
On all sides he heard persons asking who he was. His hands&#xD;
were grasped and shaken warmly by many who were entire&#xD;
strangers to him, who pronounced the highest eulogiums on&#xD;
his effort. Among the rest, his friend Singleton pressed to&#xD;
hi~ side, saying,&#xD;
"I congratulate you, my dear fellow, with all my heart.&#xD;
It was decidedly the most successful ddut ever witnessed&#xD;
here. I knew it was in you. I felt awfully bad at, ~lrst,&#xD;
while you hesitated. . I feared you would fail. But I was&#xD;
soon relieved, and perceived that your agitation was only&#xD;

&#xD;
that of the mountain before its volcanic fires blaze forth on&#xD;
the blackened air of night."&#xD;
Drayton returned to his office with a feeling of pride~ and&#xD;
a consciousness of intellectual strength such ~s he had never&#xD;
felt before. It was his first triumph, and in it he read 'an&#xD;
augury of his future success. The shadows which h~d of&#xD;
late 'been reeling over his prospects, like mists along the val-&#xD;
ley, were swept aside. 'Hope returned to his bosom with&#xD;
sweet assurance on her lips. Oh, the first intoxicating&#xD;
draught from the cup of fame! Who that has once tasted&#xD;
it can ever forget the rapture of that hour, when visions of&#xD;
conquests floated around the dreaming brow with all the&#xD;
vividness with which the 'destiny of a nation unfolded itself&#xD;
before the mind of a prophet of the olden time. It is the&#xD;
Hegira of ambition, and, however resplendent may be his sub-&#xD;
sequent career, to it the aspirant ever after turns, for there&#xD;
is no ecstasy like that flr~t one which burns like a star away&#xD;
back amid the shadows of the past.&#xD;
In noticing the proceedings of the meeting, the Democratic&#xD;
journal took occasion to refer to Drayton's speech in terms&#xD;
of th(most flattering nature, and predicted eminent success&#xD;
in his profession for "this young champion of the rights of&#xD;
the people." It was the first time he had seen his name as-&#xD;
sociated with praise in print, and he read and re-read it with&#xD;
all the delight usual on such occasions.&#xD;
The next day he called on his gouty uncle, and found that&#xD;
gentleman in a most unamiable mood. He had scarcely&#xD;
entered his~ presence, when the- splenetic old gentleman, turn-&#xD;
ing a fierce eye on him, said,&#xD;
"I see, boy, that things are taking the course that I ex-&#xD;
pected, and that you've been making yourself exactly as ri-&#xD;
diculous as I thought you would."&#xD;
"I am not aw~rc, sir, That I have placed myself in such&#xD;
a situation," returned Drayton, calmly.&#xD;
"The deuce you're not !" exclaimed the doctor, in a voice&#xD;
which contrasted very forcibly with the mildness of the neph-&#xD;
ew's tones. "Have you not been making a show of your&#xD;
absurdity at a plebeian meeting? Did I not see your name&#xD;
in a. paper whose praise is dishonor? Did you not make ~.&#xD;
speech the other night to the rabbii, whose chief boa~ris&#xD;
that their hands are hard ana their shirts unwashed? A&#xD;
pretty place for you to exhibit yourself in, isn't it ?" added&#xD;
the doctor, with a sneer. -&#xD;
"I am not aware that my conduct on that occasion enti-&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.                    22~&#xD;
ties me to the hurricane you've raised about my head. It&#xD;
is true, I made a speech~ and I am very glad it was consid-&#xD;
ered worthy of the high encomiurxl that paper pronounced&#xD;
upon it."&#xD;
"What business have you, sir, to be making exciting har..&#xD;
argues to ragged crowds ?" said the doctor, in a dictatorial&#xD;
tone. "Why do you not stay in your office and try to get&#xD;
the means of supporting yourself? Do you imagine I will&#xD;
assist you, when you are doing every thing in your power to&#xD;
elevate a pack of scoundrels to oflic~?"'&#xD;
"I have done what I take pride in," returned Drayton,&#xD;
still maintaining an appearance of great composure, "and&#xD;
shall be careful to repeat my conduct when an opportunity&#xD;
is again afforded me."&#xD;
"I had hoped to find you ashamed instead of obstinate,"&#xD;
said the uncle, relaxing his sternness.&#xD;
"When I am guilty of an act which deserves penitence, I&#xD;
will feel ashamed, not before," retorted-Drayton, firmly, try-&#xD;
ing to master his vexation.&#xD;
"It will be much to your interest, boy, henceforth to keep&#xD;
away from such places," said the uncle.&#xD;
"When my interests conflict with my duty, I shall not&#xD;
long hesitate about sacrificing them," replied Drayton;&#xD;
The coolness and positiveness with which this remark&#xD;
was made caused the uncle to feel much vexed. A frown&#xD;
gathered on his brow, and he exclaimed,&#xD;
"You may go to the devil your own way, but I hope I&#xD;
may be cursed if I assist you !"&#xD;
"I did not come here, uncle, to petition you for your&#xD;
bounty; I merely came to pay my respects, and to see how&#xD;
you were.~~&#xD;
"I don't want to see you until your senses come back.&#xD;
And now you will please pay me what you owe me, and&#xD;
leave my office and my presence. I'll have nothing more&#xD;
to do with you.&#xD;
"As to the pittance I owe you for rent," said Drayton,&#xD;
rising, while his cheek br~rncd and his lip was tremulous&#xD;
with rage, "I will arrange it at my convenience, and then&#xD;
leave your office. As to your presence, sir, I will leave that&#xD;
with great pleasure. I would have shunned you long ago&#xD;
had it not been for the relationship subsisting between us,&#xD;
which, thank Heaven! does not extend to the soul, but is&#xD;
confined to the' blood."&#xD;
"Pare you insult me to my teeth !" exclaimed the doe-&#xD;

&#xD;
tor, with a face livid with passion. "If you do not pay me&#xD;
what you owe me, I will warrant you forthwith."&#xD;
Without deigning to notice what the doctor said, iDrayton&#xD;
walked out of the house, and proceeded to his office. When&#xD;
the turbulence of his feelings had subsided, he began to con-&#xD;
sider what he should do, and, as a preliminary step, he con-&#xD;
cluded to visit Oakwood. As he rode along, musing over&#xD;
his difficulties, he saw Mr. Fleetwood ahead of him. Re-&#xD;
cently he had become very familiar with that solitary man,&#xD;
and in his society had passed ms~ny agreeable hours. Riding&#xD;
along at a rapid gait, he soon overtook him, and, at his rc-&#xD;
quest, proceeded with him to his residence. He told Mr.&#xD;
Fleetwood of all his troubles, and his quarrel with his uncle,&#xD;
and when he finished his account, the solitary man advised&#xD;
him to get ar~other office, and insisted on his accepting a sum&#xD;
of money from him either as a loan or a present. To this&#xD;
Drayton objected, while Mr. Fleetwood urged it on him with&#xD;
unusual warmth of manner.&#xD;
"I insist on your obliging me in this matter. I wish to&#xD;
prove to you how deeply I am interested in you. l3esides,&#xD;
the money I offer you is of right- yours. You see, I owed&#xD;
your grandfather a sum of money when I went abroad, and&#xD;
on my return he was dead. As his grandson, you're. enti-&#xD;
tled to it~ I have enough for all my wants withoutt it, and&#xD;
if you are so squeamish about it, you can cancel the obliga..&#xD;
tion when your circumstances improve."&#xD;
Telling him he would think of it further, Drayton bade&#xD;
the old gentleman good evening. As he rode along, he could&#xD;
not but contrast the conduct of the solitary with that of his&#xD;
uncle, who had more means than he could possibly make&#xD;
use ofJ As he passed on slowly, he thought a great deal&#xD;
about Mr. Fleetwood's eccentricities, and wondered how it&#xD;
happened that one who lived so much to himself should be&#xD;
so warm and so unselfish in hi~ sympathies. He~-had not&#xD;
solved this problem satisfactorily to himself before he reach-&#xD;
ed the lane which led to Oakwood, and, turning into it, he&#xD;
was soon happy in the presence of the ladies and George,&#xD;
who were sitting in the porch, as described in the last chapter.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
DRAY'roN's anxiety fot the recovery of George. had induced&#xD;
him to visit Oakwood very frequently of tate, on which oc-&#xD;
casions he had witnessed Ellen's devotion to her brother, and&#xD;
admired and loved her the more for it. He felt -convinced&#xD;
that his friend must- soon pass away from the abodes ~f the&#xD;
living, leaving a void which could not be supplied in the&#xD;
hearts of those. who loved him. It was with much emotion&#xD;
that he observed how iapidly disease was completing its&#xD;
work. At each successive visit he found his friend weaker&#xD;
than when he had last parted from him. His whole ap-&#xD;
pearance indicated extreme feebleness, and Drayton felt as-&#xD;
sured that his sun of life was but hovering over the horizon.&#xD;
After sitting and conversing with the ladies a while, George&#xD;
requested brayton to walk with him. He clung to his&#xD;
friend's arm, and moved onward slowly and with a faltering&#xD;
step.&#xD;
"It will soon be over," said George, stopping to recover&#xD;
from the exhaustion of the walk. "It is about a year, Dray.&#xD;
ton," he continued,." since I first saw you, and told you that at&#xD;
this time the winds would be sighing over my insensate clay.&#xD;
You expressed your disbelief in my prediction. It is true that&#xD;
the issue did not verify the prophecy to the letter, but it will&#xD;
not be much longer delayed. Since I first met you here,&#xD;
Hope and Love have told me many flattering tales of joys&#xD;
which should be mine on this side of the grave. Of late,&#xD;
their batteries have ceased;- and Hope, now in the guise of&#xD;
a seraph, paints to my mind only those delights which are&#xD;
to be met with beyond the shadows of time.~~&#xD;
He paused, but as Drayton's heart was too full of emotion&#xD;
to admit a reply, he continued,&#xD;
"I hope, my dear friend, you will often come here when&#xD;
I can not welcome you. When you stand above the turf&#xD;
where they lay me, and recall the vanished form of the&#xD;
slumberer, think, ]3rayton, think of the fortitude with which&#xD;
he met his fate-think how uncomplainingly he bore his&#xD;
afflictions~-and think of what he now tells you, that a. clear&#xD;
conscience- is the only thing on this -side of the grave which&#xD;
can divest it of its terrors."&#xD;

&#xD;
Glancing, as he spoke, at Drayton, he perceived that lie&#xD;
was struggling with emotions, and said no more. They&#xD;
passed, on until they reached a seat they had often occupied.&#xD;
When they were seated, George, in the low' and somewhat&#xD;
mournful tone of voice which he had conversed in of late, said,&#xD;
"I understand you made your d6but the other evening at&#xD;
a political meeting, on which occasion you made a most elp-&#xD;
quent speech. Although my predilections are all with the&#xD;
other party, yet I congratulate you most sincerely on your&#xD;
success. Persevere, Drayton, and I have no doubt you will&#xD;
reach the eminence you desire. I have faith enough in your&#xD;
integrity to believe you will always exert your influence on&#xD;
the side of truth and justice. It must certainly be a mo-&#xD;
ment of intense gratification when the orator ezichains the&#xD;
attention of a multitude, while every face around him gives&#xD;
evidence of the triumph of his powers.",&#xD;
"It is certainly a proud as well as a very responsible sit-&#xD;
uation," returned Drayton. "I was particularly pleased&#xD;
with the manner in which the speech you have alluded to&#xD;
was received, because it assured me that my dreams of suc-&#xD;
cess were not altogether illusory, and that I am not desti-&#xD;
tute of the power to move the minds of others. You 'may&#xD;
be sure that I will take your advice, and persevere. A young&#xD;
man should not be satisfied with the excellence he has at-&#xD;
tained, but press forward to realize the expectations which&#xD;
previous successes warrant I never knew a man who was&#xD;
continually looking at what he had done, who went~ much&#xD;
beyond these efforts afterward. It is your man who looks&#xD;
forward, and prepares himself with the means of executing&#xD;
*what he wishes to do, of whom most is to be expected.&#xD;
A noble ambition never reposes, like a voluptuous Sybarite,&#xD;
on a couch, counting over the laurels it has won, but girds&#xD;
itself for the distant goal before it, for which it pants as if it&#xD;
had done nothing as yet."&#xD;
"Your remarks, I think, are true," said George. "I have&#xD;
* observed, among the young men of my acquaintance, some&#xD;
of finely organized minds, who have failed signally) because&#xD;
they have conceived an ambition for small things, instead&#xD;
of concentrating their hopes and thoughts on magnificent&#xD;
objects. Some of these persons become enamored of social,&#xD;
distinction, and go into society for the purpose of winning&#xD;
reputations for address and conversation. In this way they&#xD;
devote~hemselves to inferior objects, and, after a while, the&#xD;
consideration of petty triumphs engrosses their minds, and&#xD;
&#xD;
they become incapable of, or disinclined to, the long vigils&#xD;
and protracted studies which must necessarily precede the&#xD;
accomplishment of magnificent enterprises."&#xD;
"The elass of individuals to which you refer," added 'Dray-&#xD;
ton, "is~ made up of those who' desire to be splendid-not&#xD;
great men. You have noticed that they who are born to&#xD;
wealth are generally surpassed by those of meaner extrac-&#xD;
tion in the race of glory; as if Providence had ordained a.&#xD;
system of compensations by which it was decreed, from the&#xD;
beginning, that to the poor should be awarded the honors of&#xD;
this world, and to the rich nothing that money will not buy."&#xD;
"The truth of your remark is as old' as society," observed&#xD;
George. "The rich, seeing the deference which is paid to&#xD;
# wealth, content themselves with the influence it gives them,&#xD;
while the poor are compelled to exert their minds or remain&#xD;
obscure. From evil good frequently comes; and we, are in-&#xD;
debted to the aristocratic distinctions in society for the devel-&#xD;
opment of many splendid ixiinds. The first and leading im-'&#xD;
pulse' with many who are born in the obscure ranks of soci-'&#xD;
ety is, to rise superior to the condition in which they find&#xD;
themselves, and where the exclusiveness of aristocracy would&#xD;
forever confine them. In the absence of wealth, this can&#xD;
only. be achieved by superior mental cultivation; and many&#xD;
poor young men give their days and nights to study for the&#xD;
purpose of overcoming the opposition of aristocracy, who, if&#xD;
society were organized on Democratic principles, would re-&#xD;
main unlearned. Having conceived a relish for study in this&#xD;
way, they afterward become enamored of fame, and strive&#xD;
for that intellectual superiority to which it is awarded."&#xD;
"It is neither from the highest nor the lowest class in so-&#xD;
ciety from which eminent men generally spring," observed&#xD;
Drayton. "The classes between these polar extremes sup-&#xD;
ply mankind with the largest proportion of great men. The&#xD;
leaders in moral and mental enterprises have generally em-&#xD;
anated from those abodes where comfort, not splendor or&#xD;
squalidness, is found."&#xD;
"True," returned George; "and the reason is, that the&#xD;
very poorest class is crushed by the primeval curse to the&#xD;
earth; and they who compose it', being under the necessity of&#xD;
laboring with. their hands, have no leisure to improve their&#xD;
minds, and retain their heritage of ignorance and coarseness,&#xD;
while the wealthiest fritter their energies away among the&#xD;
thousand frivolities of society."&#xD;
"A bye of social excitements is unfavorable to the love&#xD;

of fame, for it is in solitude that genius must fit itself for art&#xD;
honorable career," said iDrayton. "I do not mean that a&#xD;
man must flee to the rocks and the shady groves, lie may&#xD;
live in the midst of a city, and its noise may be an eternal&#xD;
chime in his ear. Indeed, the solitude of a city should be&#xD;
preferred by a man of genius, for he can observe every pulsa-&#xD;
tion of its heart, and reflect upon every cause which agitates&#xD;
the human sea; but he should remember that his business,&#xD;
for a season at. least, i~ that of a spectator rather than actor&#xD;
among its exciting scenes."&#xD;
"I suspect," said George, "that in the majority of instan-&#xD;
ces the ability to resist the excitements of the world is not&#xD;
so strong as the disposition to partake of them. When vir-&#xD;
tue enters the arena against vice, it has nothing to gain and&#xD;
every thing to lose. The orator should watch and study ev-&#xD;
ery current of society, for his business is with men; but the&#xD;
literary man, the favorite of the Muses, will ever find a more&#xD;
congenial home amid the works of nature. He should hold&#xD;
more communion with the departed than with the living;&#xD;
his thoughts should be with the authors of~ those imperisha-&#xD;
ble works which -have survived the mutations of centuries,&#xD;
and come down to us with the accumulated praises of ages&#xD;
on them. What has such a one to do with the every-day&#xD;
concerns of this world? with the fluctuations of markets? the&#xD;
successive follies of fashion? or the trifling incidents which&#xD;
engross the masses of men? Let him retire to some solitary&#xD;
Patmos, as the beloved disciple did, and there brood over the&#xD;
infinite, an4 enjoy his sublime visions. He will find nature&#xD;
to be his best instructor, and in his library he will discover&#xD;
inexhaustible sources of amusement and wisdom."&#xD;
"Your litei~ary man would then be but a mere book-&#xD;
worm," said Drayton. "He would be wise where all oth-&#xD;
ers are ignorant, and ignorant on those subjects on which&#xD;
the meanest minds are informed.'~&#xD;
"I do not insist that such a one should surrender every&#xD;
hope, thought, and feeling of his nature to books and reflec-&#xD;
tion," returned George, earnestly, "but I do insist that he&#xD;
should be uncompromising in his devotion to such studies.&#xD;
Let him select friends with whom he can exercise his sym-&#xD;
pathies, but let him not be seen on all occasions participa-&#xD;
ting in social ekeitements. I would not have him entirely&#xD;
to neglect the present for the past, but I certainly think he&#xD;
should not permit the follies around him to engross much of&#xD;
his attention."'&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"J~.iterary men should understand the spirit of the age in&#xD;
which they live, which they could not do if their hearts were&#xD;
as much with the dead as you require they should be," re-&#xD;
turned Drayton. "It is, in my opinion, indispensable that&#xD;
they should be conversant with their owr~ times-that they&#xD;
should closely inspect every class and sect. of men-that they&#xD;
should relish society-in short, be well informed on all points&#xD;
which concern common men, in order to become their in-&#xD;
structors."&#xD;
"I speak only of the devoted literary man," said George,&#xD;
"and not of the thousands who. have some taste for litera-&#xD;
ture; and such would soon grow wea.ry of the excitements&#xD;
of his age. Society would, after a little acquaintance, cease&#xD;
to present any new phases to his view, and he would tire of&#xD;
its reiterated hollownesses. It is no place for him, for it can&#xD;
not appreciate the true literary man, and he is frequently&#xD;
pained by seeing that he is misunderstood. When the mood&#xD;
is on him, and his eye sparkles with light, and his lip trem-&#xD;
bles with pathos-when he throws forth jeweled thoughts&#xD;
with uncalculating prodigality, those who' hear him wear'&#xD;
wondering coun.teuances, and deem the flashes of heavenly&#xD;
light which radiate from his features to be but a wild and&#xD;
erratic enthusiasm, which leads him afar from prudence and&#xD;
his own interests. He is conscious of their pity, and ~uncer-&#xD;
tam of their admiration."&#xD;
"Such a consciousness must be wormwood to a proud and&#xD;
sensitive heart," returned Drayton, with much warmth, "and&#xD;
teach it to scorn and contemn mankin&amp;amp;' Such a considera-&#xD;
t ion teaches the necessity why a literary man should go&#xD;
frequently into society. If he were familiar with men, he&#xD;
would commit no such blunders as you r~aention, and be able&#xD;
to adapt himself and his conversation to -those around him."&#xD;
"In such an event, he must change or debase his intel-&#xD;
lectual character," returned George. "To adapt himself to&#xD;
a lower gradation of being than his own would require a sac-&#xD;
rifice which, instead of benefiting, would inevitably degrade&#xD;
a superior man."&#xD;
"Not if he were compact in mind and morals," added&#xD;
Drayton. "I confess I have but little reverence for that&#xD;
wisdom which it is the peculiar province of cells and clois-&#xD;
ters to tea~h, and which savors more of the lamp~ than of&#xD;
humanity. It is too -misty and abstract for the world, how-&#xD;
ever much it may edify those who regard the owl-the bird&#xD;
which is blinded by- th&amp;amp; light of day-as the bird of wisdom.&#xD;

- The philosopher who sits on some fancied Olympus, and ful-&#xD;
minates his decrees, will ilot be heard in the valleys where&#xD;
the multitudes dwell."&#xD;
"So long as genius is rather of the nature of the eagle,&#xD;
which pursues a solitary flight, than of that of the storm-&#xD;
petrel, which is one of a multitudinous flock, so long must it&#xD;
dwell apart, if it would obey and be true to itself;" returned&#xD;
George. "He who has once found delight in an idolatry of&#xD;
the stars, the sea, the forest, the mountain, and all the bright&#xD;
and beautiful sources of poetic inspiration so lavishly display-&#xD;
ed throughout creation, must, sooner or later, if he forsake&#xD;
them, sigh for their companionship. He will often turn his&#xD;
weary eye back on the sunny eminence of the Parnassus he&#xD;
has left, which stii~ looms brightly through the mists which&#xD;
surround him in society. He may descend from its far-view-&#xD;
ing heights, doff his imperial mantle, and assume the every-&#xD;
day garb of fashion, and give himself up to the pomps of the&#xD;
world for a while; but he will soon learn that the beaten&#xD;
highways are not for his feet, and, becoming disgusted with&#xD;
the vanities of the world, he will seek the mountain paths&#xD;
he has forsaken, and be truer to his own heart in the future.&#xD;
I only insist that as nature determines, before experience,&#xD;
what course a man should pursue, he who finds in himself&#xD;
many thoughts and feelings which are not common to men,&#xD;
is untrue to himself, false to his own interests, when he im-&#xD;
molates.his own peculiarities on the blackened altar of cus-&#xD;
tom."&#xD;
"If your hypothesis in relation to genius is true, then If&#xD;
grant your arguments are irresistible," replied Drayton; "but&#xD;
what saysexperience on this subject? Were Spenser, Shaks-&#xD;
peare, Milton, Pope, and other great poets, to be found in&#xD;
the desert? Or were they not dwellers near the great heart&#xD;
of humanity, and familiar with all its pulsations ?"&#xD;
"But those poets you mention," replied George, "sighed&#xD;
for solitude, in order that they might throw off the weight&#xD;
of the crowd, and unbosom their mighty thoughts and feel-&#xD;
ings which struggled for utterance. If those men had been&#xD;
able to live as they desired, they Would, in all probability,&#xD;
have forsaken the dust of the city. Because, in many in-&#xD;
stances, great men, by gigantic efforts, have been able to&#xD;
throw off the manacles of society, and to be great in spite&#xD;
of jostling littleness, it does not 'follow that such hindrances&#xD;
are not fatal to many. Besides, the men you brought for-&#xD;
ward lived much to themselves, and not one of them has&#xD;
&#xD;
said that society was better adapted to the man of genius&#xD;
than solitude, but they all hold the opposite language."&#xD;
"The truth is, no general rule can be applied to al~ the di-&#xD;
versities of genius," remarked Drayton. "While some would&#xD;
sicken and die in the crowd, others find the aliment which&#xD;
sustains and strengthens their minds amid the bustling mul-&#xD;
titudes. Cooper would pine away in the city, and Johnson&#xD;
would scarcely have survived a banishment to the country.&#xD;
But there is one thing connected witLthis subject that can&#xD;
not be denied, and that is, many men of genius have fallen&#xD;
victims to the vices of society, who, if they had stood aloof&#xD;
from the crowd, would have shone like beacon-lights along&#xD;
the shores of time."&#xD;
"I am glad to see you on my side, after all your opposi-&#xD;
tion," said George, smiling. "Melancholy, most melancholy&#xD;
has been the waste of soul in the instances of great men,&#xD;
who have surrendered themselves to vicious excitc~ments, and&#xD;
foregone their holy vocation as priests in the temple of na-&#xD;
ture. They have preferred the indulgence of withering pas-&#xD;
sions to reading the mystic language written all over the&#xD;
walls of that magnificent temple. In this way genius and&#xD;
the world have been mutually losers. To avoid the degra-&#xD;
dation of genius, I would have it stand aloof, and view the&#xD;
crowd and its reeking tumults at a distance.&#xD;
"It is not so much against society as its vices that you&#xD;
inveigh so earnestly," said Drayton. "The degradation of&#xD;
genius results from its own infirmities, and is not justly&#xD;
chargeable to any other account."&#xD;
"At the same time that I would shelter literary men from&#xD;
vice by removing them beyond the reach of its influence,"&#xD;
observed George, "I would enjoin solitude as the best school&#xD;
for the disciplining and developing of their powers."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
WHEN they returned to the house, a carriage, with richly.&#xD;
caparisoned steeds, drove off. It contained Mrs. Willough-&#xD;
by and her daughter, who were in the act of getting out as&#xD;
Geerge and Draytori reached the porch. Mrs. Willoughby&#xD;
shook hands affectionately with George, but, not deigning to&#xD;

notice his friend, elevated her aristocratic head, and, rustli~ig&#xD;
her satin, brushed by him and saluted Ellen. Maria, less&#xD;
fastidious than her mother, smiled graciously at Drayton,&#xD;
and he bowed, somewhat haughtily, in return.&#xD;
The singular paralysis whieli had oVertak~u Mrs. Willou~h.'&#xD;
by's memory, causing her to forget that it is a part of good&#xD;
breeding to manifest respect for those you visit by noticing&#xD;
their guests, not being contagious, did not affect Drayton,&#xD;
for itso happened that, in arranging themselves in the porch,&#xD;
there was but one vacant chair left, and that was near Mis~&#xD;
Willoughby, which he, without hesitation, occupied. He be-&#xD;
gan a conversation on the weather and the beauty of the&#xD;
prospect before them, and Maria listened with evident pleas-&#xD;
ure to every sex~tence he uttered. The lively girl at length&#xD;
laughed heartily at some remark i~e made, and her mother&#xD;
caught her eye and looked daggers at her, which were by&#xD;
no means fatal to her merriment. She continued converSing&#xD;
in animated tones with Drayton, notwithstanding th~ fr~Wns&#xD;
and uneasiness it gave her mother.&#xD;
"What effect does the.eountry have on you, 1~ttr. Dra.yton?&#xD;
Does it make you serious or sentimental? Do you laugh With&#xD;
the birds, or sigh with the winds ?"&#xD;
"It depends very much on the season of the year," r~turn-&#xD;
ed Drayton. "In the spring I get up a proper amount ~f&#xD;
sentimentality, and in the autumn I contrive to feel a; little&#xD;
melancholy, as you know one ought to do."&#xD;
"It always makes me wild to get in The co~.~iitrya.fter&#xD;
having been choked and fried to deat1~ in to*n," s&amp;amp;id 1~IiSS&#xD;
Willoughby~ "You and Mr. Meredith Were Just ret*r~iing&#xD;
from a walk as ma and I rode up. Where had you b~,en,&#xD;
indulging in romance?"&#xD;
"In a ~nost ~harming spot," replied Draytori. " (hi The&#xD;
bank of the river, and under the shade of those two majestic&#xD;
oaks which you see off here to the right."&#xD;
"If you will escort me," said the lady, j' I will run over&#xD;
there for a minute, just to see if I can't get clear of some of&#xD;

"Where are you going, ~[aria ?" sho~xt~d the mothe~.&#xD;
"Just over here to the bank of the river," was the-~ply.&#xD;
"You haven't got time," Maid Mm. Willoughby, *ith a&#xD;

minute," she said, and then wheeled and skipped lightly&#xD;
over the grass toward the river.&#xD;
They were soon out of the hearing of those on the porch,&#xD;
and Drayton said,&#xD;
"Your mother seems to have a very peculiar disrelish of&#xD;
me lately, Miss Willoughby."&#xD;
"Oh, she's only a little miffed, because you didn't happen&#xD;
to speak to her once upon a time. These old ladies, you&#xD;
know, are foolish, particularly in such matters. What a&#xD;
pretty redbird that is, Mr. Drayton! I wish I had him in&#xD;
a Oage."&#xD;
"If you had it under your ~charge, it would become as lan-&#xD;
guid as one of yOur sentimental lovers, and lose its powers&#xD;
of song."&#xD;
"Fy on you, sir! your metaphor is not good. Gentlemen&#xD;
sing most sweetly when under the dominion of the ladies,&#xD;
as witness all the poets from Petrareli to Burns. Indeed, I&#xD;
really think a love affair ~or so is necessary to a gentleman&#xD;
before he can become very interesting. Love makes a man&#xD;
poetical, and that, as you ought to know before this time&#xD;
from your own experience, is decidedly the most interesting&#xD;
character a gentleman can assume."&#xD;
"I suppose your tenet, then, Miss Willoughby, is, that, like&#xD;
a stricken Swan, a lover sings most sweetly when the cloud&#xD;
is on his s$rit, for that Was the ease with the poets you re-&#xD;
fer to?"&#xD;
"Exactly, sir; and if a dart ever penetrates your heart&#xD;
-bless my soul~! 'I am rhyming already. I knew a little&#xD;
fresh air Was all that was Wanting to m&amp;amp;ke me poetical-&#xD;
if your &amp;amp;bdurate heart ever is softened by love, you~ will be&#xD;
infinitely more agreeable than you are now.~~&#xD;
"And, pray, how de you know that such i&amp;amp;it6t the unfor-&#xD;
timnate predicament my heart is in ?"&#xD;
Because your brow is too calm," replied Maria, glancing&#xD;
brightly up at his face, "and your eye does not wander&#xD;
~b6~it as if 'it didi~'t know what in the World to look at"&#xD;
They wete ~This time near the spot 'designated by Dray-&#xD;
ton, and Miss Willoughby darted from ;his Side and ran, arid,&#xD;
throwing herself on the seat, drew a long breath, and ex-&#xD;
claimed,&#xD;
"What a sweet place this is! I wish to Heaven I was a&#xD;
Weod-n~mph instead of a town girl, bound and pinched up&#xD;
according to the last decrees 'of fashion !"&#xD;
"You might assume the character with great facility and&#xD;

appropriateness," said Drayton, taking a seat by her si~,&#xD;
"for fairy proportions, graceful motions, bright eyes, re~ 1ips~&#xD;
and musical tones are all that is necessary to the coniposi-&#xD;
tion of a nymph."&#xD;
"What a flattering tongue you've got, sir. , By-the-way,&#xD;
I've nit ihad. the felicity of listening to its flattery for an age&#xD;
Dr' two, and its tones sound in my ears like a Sabbath bell&#xD;
I once heard when I was a little girl, and which I again&#xD;
heard last Sunday-it recalls so many old associations."&#xD;
"You have a charming way of insinuating a compliment,"&#xD;
said Drayton. "And, if fiction and poetry are the same&#xD;
thing, you have a great genius fox that fine art."&#xD;
"Indeed, sir, instead of romancing, I was as serious as a&#xD;
preacher.".&#xD;
"What do you think of the beauty of that island ?" asked&#xD;
Drayton.&#xD;
It is the prettiest spot I ever saw," she replied; "and&#xD;
if I were that bird we saw just now, I would take up my&#xD;
abode there, without doubt."&#xD;
"And if I were another bird, I would join you, and sing&#xD;
your praises so sweetly that your heart would melt under&#xD;
my melody. You would be more coquettish than any jay-&#xD;
bird in the woodlands."&#xD;
"Very likely, for if there is any one thing I have a. par-&#xD;
ticular love for, it is- a little coquetry. Wasn't there some&#xD;
philosopher who once taught that the souls of women some-&#xD;
times inhabited the bodies of birds after death ?"&#xD;
"Pythagoras tai~ght something like that."&#xD;
"Well, if his doctrine is true, I think it likely I'll be a&#xD;
dear little bluebird, and live on that green island yet."&#xD;
I''&#xD;
"It will be a difficult matter to catch and cage you.&#xD;
"I think that very probable," replied the lady.&#xD;
"Have~ you slain any gentlemen in blue coats and tight&#xD;
boots lately, Miss Willoughby ?"&#xD;
"Yes, several. A gentleman who answers to that de-&#xD;
scription told his friend the other day that a flash from my&#xD;
blue eyes had killed him off, just like a stroke of lightning.&#xD;
Wasn't that a very interesting sort of demise for a senti-&#xD;
mental youth ?"&#xD;
"Charrning-.---a perfect euthanasia! I should like to die&#xD;
in the same way about every other day."&#xD;
"That's a sensible remark, and shows excellent taste, sir;&#xD;
but others no danger of~ your dying so poetically. Such&#xD;
stem, cold, rigid, philosophical gentlemen as you pride your-&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTO~                      241&#xD;
self on being, instead of 'dying of roses in ar9matic pain,' as&#xD;
somebody's poet says, go off with the ague."&#xD;
"Some more fiction from your lips," said Drayton. "You&#xD;
slander the warmth of my feelings. Bright eyes have the&#xD;
same infbience over them that sunbeams have over flowers."&#xD;
"Bless my heart! how rough this seat is," exclaimed Miss&#xD;
Willoughby. "I have stuck a splinter in my~flnger."&#xD;
"Pull off y6ur glove, and let me show my skill in extract-&#xD;
ing it."&#xD;
"Look at it, sir !" she said, when she had pulled her glove&#xD;
off, holding up her hand.&#xD;
Her hand was remarkably small and delicate, and jewels&#xD;
were flashing on her fingers. A splinter, scarcely percepti-&#xD;
ble, was in the forefinger, and as Drayton took hold of her&#xD;
hand to extract it, she said,&#xD;
"Don't squeeze my hand so."&#xD;
"I am not squeezing it," he replied. "Miss Willoughby,"&#xD;
he continued, looking admiringly at the jewels on her fingers,&#xD;
"it is decidedly the most beautiful hand in the world, and&#xD;
a very valuable one too."&#xD;
"You are a superfine judge of such things," she said, draw-&#xD;
ing on the glove, whjch act being completed, she glanced over&#xD;
the prospect before her, and continued: "I'll declare I am&#xD;
perfectly delighted with the country, and mean to set my&#xD;
cap for some plowman. Do you think I'll succeed ?"&#xD;
"Undoubtedly. Just let your intention be kiiown, and&#xD;
the ity will be depopulated of its young gentlemen, who&#xD;
will ke to the plow instanter, to the very great improve-&#xD;
ment o e agricultural interests of this section of the world."&#xD;
"Don't ou suppose I should be as superior as a milkmaid&#xD;
as those ge tlemen would be as plowmen? My dairy would&#xD;
be the sw etest, and my dr~cks and geese the best sailors,&#xD;
an turkies the fattest birds in the country. Such a life&#xD;
would be a perfect elysium. But, bless me! Mr. Dr~yton,&#xD;
you are so interesting that I forget how fast the sun is going&#xD;
down, and that ma is waiting like Job's wife for me. Come,&#xD;
let us go back to the house."&#xD;
She rose, and, pith Drayton at her side, sauntered along,&#xD;
stopping frequently to admire the prospect or to cull a flower.&#xD;
As she approached the house, hanging to his arm, with her&#xD;
mouth wreathed with smiles, her mother looked lightning at&#xD;
her, and rose and proceeded to the carriage. Maria lingered&#xD;
provokingly behind, saying' a word to the ladies, arid ~l~n&#xD;
another to the gentlemen, until her mother lost her anii~ il-&#xD;

ity, as w~ evidei~t from her restlessness and frequent com-&#xD;
mands to her daughter to get into the carriage. As they&#xD;
rode home the young lady received a very severe lecture for&#xD;
her unpardonable conduct in going off with such an individ..&#xD;
ual as Drayton. She justified her conduct, and the mother's&#xD;
anger increased, and she vented a volley of indignant words&#xD;
on her daughter's head, from which one would have inferred&#xD;
that, among Mrs. Willoughby's virtues, maternal love was by&#xD;
no means the most conspicuous.&#xD;
CHAPTER XL.&#xD;
As they left the supper table Colonel Meredith told Dray-&#xD;
ton he wished to see him before he retired, a that he would&#xD;
be in the library~room. The ladies rep~jfed to their cham-&#xD;
ber at ten o'clock, and Drayton proceeded to the library.&#xD;
The colonel was sitting at a table, on which were several&#xD;
volumes, most of them old works and great favorites. His&#xD;
reading was generally very desultory, and in the course of&#xD;
the evening he had consulted half a dozen different authors.&#xD;
He frequently remarked that it was much more pleasant and&#xD;
profitable in reading to skip from one volume to another with&#xD;
which you were acquainted, than to confine yourself to one;&#xD;
for, when you read attentively, trains of thought would be&#xD;
started in your mind which ought to be pursued, and they&#xD;
would necessarily lead you from one book to another, in ac-&#xD;
cordance with your particular mood. In this wa~y, he con-&#xD;
tended, he would derive more amusement and instruction&#xD;
from twenty volumes in the course of a day, thlin he could&#xD;
have done had he confined himself to one work. As Dray-&#xD;
ton approached him, he laid down the book he was reading,&#xD;
and, pushing his spectacles back on his forehead, said,&#xD;
"My object in requesting your presence here was to have&#xD;
some conversation with you about that poor unfortunate&#xD;
young marl, whose trial is to come on the day after to-mor-&#xD;
row. The last time I saw Roger he looked ill, and was&#xD;
quite disconsolate. Ii never felt so deep an interest in a pris-&#xD;
oner before. I have but little doubt of his acquittal. The&#xD;
jury must bring in a verdict of guilty of justifiable homicide,&#xD;
for I can not anticipate any other result from what I know&#xD;
of the testimony that will be given in on the trial."&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.                    243&#xD;
lie paused, and Drayton concurring with him as to the&#xD;
probable result of the trial, he continued,&#xD;
"I feel a very hearty interest in your 'success also. I&#xD;
mean to be present, and expect a fine effort~ from you. What&#xD;
has been said of your speech at the political meeting the&#xD;
other night will cause people to expect a very brilliant one&#xD;
from you on that occasion. I think you told me you had&#xD;
never made a speech at the bar ?"&#xD;
"I have not; and as my speech on the trial is to be my&#xD;
first effort in the court-house, I can not but feel a great deal&#xD;
of uneasiness in reference to it. I intend to do my best-..--&#xD;
to strain every energy I possess, for my impoverished finan-&#xD;
ces require it of me. I must have money, and that I can&#xD;
not get without business, and to procure that I must have&#xD;
reputation."&#xD;
"The occasion will afford you an excellent field for the&#xD;
display of your powers of reason and eloquence," remarked&#xD;
the colonel. "Let me caution you, however, against some&#xD;
errors common to young lawyers. Do not be hasty; do not&#xD;
lose your self-control; and, above all, do not neglect your&#xD;
client in your desire to display yourself. Remember you are&#xD;
not addressing a crowd at a political meeting, but judges&#xD;
and jurors, who feel that solemn responsibilities are upon&#xD;
them. Make a manly and vigorous speech, and you will&#xD;
win the confidence of the judges. Their good opinion will&#xD;
be of more advantage to you henceforth than the applause&#xD;
of the populace; These old, grave, learned heads are apt to&#xD;
smile at all the very fine things that young men feel proud&#xD;
of saying. They estimate a man by the skill, sagacity, and&#xD;
learning he exhibits, and not by ~the poetry and passion he&#xD;
displays. I would not have you~ designedly to omit an ap-&#xD;
peal to the feelings, when you ~an introduce it as if it sprang&#xD;
spontaneously from something you have already ~aid. In&#xD;
fine, be moderate.; indulge in no extravagances; do not suf-&#xD;
fer your excitement to blind your sagacity; and I have no&#xD;
doubt, from what I know of your ability, that your success&#xD;
will be brilliant."&#xD;
Drayton thanked him kindly for his advice, and the con-&#xD;
versation turned on many particulars connected with the a -&#xD;
proaching trial, which need not be repeated here. Having&#xD;
discussed these subjects, they talked of other matters, and&#xD;
Drayton remarked,&#xD;
"I wonder, colonel, that you have never, in your retire-&#xD;
ment here among the relics of ~he wisdom of former times&#xD;

-so well calculated to suggest such a course-.found oppor~&#xD;
unity and inclination to write out your reflections for the&#xD;
benefit of the world. From your taste, experience, and abil-&#xD;
ity, I know you could produce a work which would be use-&#xD;
ful to others, and give you a reputation for authorship."&#xD;
"I have speculated sometimes on the propriety of becom~&#xD;
ing an author in my old age," returned the colonel, "but&#xD;
have not as yet made up my mind to do so. I have, like&#xD;
most" persons in my situation and with my tastes, from time&#xD;
to time writteit out my thoughts on a variety of subj ects,&#xD;
the disposition of which I shall probably leave to those who&#xD;
come after me. If they think the world would receive them&#xD;
kindly, they can publish them; if not, they will but share a&#xD;
fate common to such things."&#xD;
"If it should be my fate to survive you, I will certainly&#xD;
expect tolearn much from your intellectual labors. A last-&#xD;
ing fame-a permanent abiding-place in the gratitude and&#xD;
the memory of mankind, is the ~noblest worldly achievement&#xD;
of which man is capable. Some persons affect to wonder&#xD;
how an individual can forego the pleasures of sense, and de-&#xD;
vote himself to the pursuit of so unsubstantial a phantom as&#xD;
fame. I suspect such persons, however, have not the means&#xD;
of understanding in what the pleasures of the great poet or&#xD;
philosopher consist. That such a passion is a most worthy&#xD;
one is evident from the fact that the greatest and wisest&#xD;
men of all ages have been the most devoted to it."&#xD;
"A lasting fam&amp;amp; is the reward of a life-long labor per-&#xD;
formed by a superior mind," said Colonel Meredith. "Now,&#xD;
if that labor 'was uncheered during its continuance, it would&#xD;
be wise to condemn it. Intellectual pleasures differ so much&#xD;
from the enjoyments of the sense, that it is difficult to de-&#xD;
scribe them intelligibly. A person must, experience before&#xD;
he can appreciate them. The attempt to convey to an un-&#xD;
learnedrnind am idea of the delight which a philosopher ex-&#xD;
periences in his study, while developing an important theory,&#xD;
or the raptures the poet feels while contemplating the mag-&#xD;
nificent visions that pass before his mind, would be useless.&#xD;
Inexperienced persons should be satisfied with the testimo-&#xD;
nies which great men in all ages have given of the pleas-&#xD;
ures of the pnrsnit of fame, 'and take for granted what it&#xD;
seems they can not convinc~~ themselves of. namely, that&#xD;
such men as Aristotle, Bacon, and Newton Were uot fools."&#xD;
"The fear of cotemporary~critics has kept many men from&#xD;
publishing the. results~ ~f their studies," said Dra~ton. "It&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTO]~I.                          ~45&#xD;
&#xD;
is an ignoble fear, however, and he who desires reputation&#xD;
must prepare to encounter opposition. The majority would&#xD;
much rather pull an aspirant down than assist him upward.&#xD;
I hope, colonel, such considerations never had.weight with&#xD;
you.~~&#xD;
"I never was sufficiently anxious for contemporaneous rep..&#xD;
station to push my pretensions, and I therefore have, in im-&#xD;
itation of the great men we have been talking of, concluded&#xD;
to submit my labors to posterity," replied the col6nel, smil-&#xD;
ing. "The truth is, I should fear to hazard a failure in lit-&#xD;
erature. . It is not always the most worthy who draw a prize&#xD;
in the lottery of fame. There are many works of decided&#xD;
merit which meet with a speedy oblivion, while others, of&#xD;
much less intrinsic claims to consideration, by a fortunate&#xD;
conjuncture of circumstances, survive, as if to show how little&#xD;
discrimination the world possesses. Literary distinction is&#xD;
often won where there is but little intellectual merit to sup-&#xD;
port it. Shallowness frequently succeeds where profundity&#xD;
fails in literature, as flashy lawyers often get rich while&#xD;
their learned neighbors starve."&#xD;
"But transcendent merit must succeed, whether the&#xD;
cha~tces you speak of are favorable or not. Genius' will&#xD;
force the world to feel its power sooner or later, whether&#xD;
the world will or not."&#xD;
"There is some truth in your observations, said the col-&#xD;
onel; "but I never fancied myself one of the pre-eminently-&#xD;
gifted few, and therefore had not that incentive to urge me&#xD;
on. My studies have always been delightful to me, and I&#xD;
needed not the promptings of ambition to induce me to pur-&#xD;
sue them. My desire for knowledge was always invincible,&#xD;
and I have, in consequence, from my youth, been an invet-&#xD;
erate reader. Here," he continued, becoming animated, and&#xD;
turning his eyes toward the shelves crowded' with books,&#xD;
"here, amid the monuments of the genius of all ages, I can&#xD;
find amusement for all my moods; and the older I grow, the&#xD;
more disposition I feel to abstract myself from the living and&#xD;
to devote my days to the dead. My companions in this place&#xD;
are the intellectual~ giants of all time. I throw my mind back&#xD;
on past ages, and view the majestic Roman and the splendid&#xD;
Greek as they were in the palmy days of their states. In&#xD;
fancy I can see the venerable men of antiquity in the Are-&#xD;
opagus and i~ the Forum, by the Ilyssus and the Tiber, and&#xD;
catch the words of 'wisdom and of wit which radiate from&#xD;
their lips. With the shadowy monks in their cells and the&#xD;

&#xD;
profound logicians among their disciples-the mer~ of the&#xD;
Middle Ages who prepared the way for the triumphs of sci-&#xD;
ence and art which have, since their time, shed inextinguish-&#xD;
able sunlight on the dark places in which they groped and&#xD;
stumbled-with these men I spend many pleasant hours.&#xD;
With Rabelais and Montaigne, Browne, Taylor, and Milton,&#xD;
I can laugh or weep over the errors of humanity. The near-&#xD;
er I approach that shadowy realm where mortal vision fails,&#xD;
the more intimate becomes the feeling which attaches me to&#xD;
the imperishable dead, whom I must, before the lapse of&#xD;
many years, meet on the shores of the eternal sea. The or-&#xD;
ators, philosophers, and poets of all ages come before me&#xD;
when I choose to summon them up, and, holding communion&#xD;
with them, I forget that clouds have darkened my sky, or&#xD;
that Time ever shakes a grief or a pestilence from his un-&#xD;
wearying wing7"&#xD;
"It is certainly an invaluable privilege thus to be able&#xD;
to abstract the mind from anxieties and griefs, and to fix its&#xD;
thoughts on subjects which never change or make us weary,"&#xD;
observed Drayton, wishing to incite the colonel to proceed.&#xD;
"The feelings of many are so fickle that they can not be in-&#xD;
terested long in any one pursuit. They crave such aliment&#xD;
as novelty affords, and with them, to be accustomed to a&#xD;
thing is tantamount to conceiving a disrelislu for it."&#xD;
"True," returned the colonel; "and I am thankful that&#xD;
such is the constitution of my mind,, that the more intimate&#xD;
I become with a subject, the more points of interest I dis-&#xD;
cover in it. An old book, which I have consulted a thou-&#xD;
sand times, is to me an old friend. I know its merits-its&#xD;
whims and its oddities, and I love them all. I have proved&#xD;
its excellence. I know all that it contains; and when I&#xD;
read it it is like talking with an old acquaintance on our past&#xD;
pleasures. It can not startle me with its heresies, neither&#xD;
can its sophistry entrap my belief. I could not part with it&#xD;
without shedding a tear to its memory; for it is blended with&#xD;
so many sweet recollections, associated with so many pleas-&#xD;
ant hours, that it seems to be a part of my history. When-&#xD;
ever I open the pages of some favorite, the shadowy old au-&#xD;
thor comes and takes his seat at my side, and I fancy I hear&#xD;
hirti say a great many, things only darkly hinted at in his&#xD;
writings. My ruind~ frequently becomes so engrosse\ with&#xD;
these spiritual visitors that I forget the present, and, ex-&#xD;
claiming with Addison, 'These are my companions!' I feel&#xD;
a strong disposition :to ask a jovial fellow like Ben Jonson to&#xD;
&#xD;
flRAYTON.                   ~47&#xD;
share a social glass with me. Not only are the noble4~owed&#xD;
authors themselves my associates, but many of the charac-&#xD;
ters they have shadowed forth throng around me. Falstaff,&#xD;
and Sir Roger de Coverley, for instance, are as palpable&#xD;
personages as their authors, and with them I have i~njoyed&#xD;
many a short-lived hour of mirth. The old English authors&#xD;
are a bluff, jovial crew, and discourse more wisdom and&#xD;
truth than the authors of any other nation. I love them for&#xD;
their heartiness, their quaintness, their simplicity, their truth-&#xD;
fulness, over which is shed the mellowing influence of a ge-&#xD;
nius of incomparable richness. The difference between the&#xD;
men of antiquity and the old English writers is, that the&#xD;
former speak like their own gods, and the latter are old&#xD;
friends with whose frailties you are perfectly~ well acquaint-&#xD;
ed. You reverence the one class, and'love the other."&#xD;
"I suspect some of your friends in the flesh would ,smile&#xD;
at your love for those in the spirit," said Drayton, who was&#xD;
much interested in the sketch the colonel had given him of&#xD;
his intellectual pleasures. "The majority of men have so&#xD;
much disrelish for phantoms of all sorts, that they wonder&#xD;
how any man in his senses can be pleased with the ghosts&#xD;
of authors dead long ago, or the imaginary characters Which&#xD;
poets and novelists have written about. They love beings&#xD;
who are tangible-they only wish to associate with men who&#xD;
have blood and sinews-and vow they never saw a spirit.&#xD;
and hint that they who profess to have dealings with such&#xD;
unrealities, have flaws in their minds through which these&#xD;
unsubstantial shadows pass. They love men who have stern&#xD;
visages-men who wink and wear broadcloth, with whom&#xD;
they can hold profitable discourse on the fickleness of the&#xD;
winds and the capriciousness of the weather, the prospect&#xD;
of wheat crops and the fluctuations of bank-stocks-not phan-&#xD;
tom men wrapped up in shadowy mantles and togas which&#xD;
went out of~fashion many a long year since."&#xD;
"I am careful, when in the presence of men of that stamp,&#xD;
not to introduce any conversation which wilLstartle their&#xD;
sense of propriety, or cause them to suspect me of lunacy."&#xD;
"It would be amusing to watch the contortions of the face&#xD;
of one of these ultra practicalists while listening to you talk-&#xD;
ing of your favorite authors. These gentlemen, who have&#xD;
an extraordinary allotment of common sense, regard an es-&#xD;
tate on Parnassus as of about as much value as one in the&#xD;
Arctic regions of the moon, and they ha~~e' nearly as much&#xD;
respect for the insane creature wh~ holds convei~sations with&#xD;

&#xD;
the old man who lives in that planet, as for those who talk&#xD;
with the gods and heroes of other days. These are your&#xD;
practical, useful men, to whom the gods have given all the&#xD;
common sense they were able to create, and who look com-&#xD;
passionately on their misguided brethren, who, neglecting the&#xD;
concerns of the present time, go back to the age of witches&#xD;
for their companions and amusements."&#xD;
"I meet a good many lovers of what is real and useful,&#xD;
according to their notions, in my walks," said the colonel,&#xD;
"but I never talk with them about the pleasures which pone&#xD;
'but students know how to appreciate. With them I dis..&#xD;
course on politics, business, and other matter-of-fact subjects,&#xD;
and they scarcely suspect me of intimacy~ with the goblins&#xD;
who are m3~ companions in my library and solitary walks.&#xD;
When a scholar is with the plain men of the world, he should&#xD;
suspend his vocation as a dreamer, and discuss topics of gen-&#xD;
eral interest. When in general society, he should be like&#xD;
those about him, and be careful to keep his thoughts on the&#xD;
merits of different authors and other subjects, of which the&#xD;
mass of men knew nothing, for men of kindred tastes with~&#xD;
his own."&#xD;
"That course, it strikes me, is the proper one for scholars&#xD;
to pursue," remarked Drayton; "but I have noticed that&#xD;
some men of learning, when in the company of men of bus-&#xD;
mess, ~are anxious to make a display of their scholarship."&#xD;
"And thus they very properly subject themselves to re-&#xD;
proach and ridicule," added the colonel. "It i~ not even po-&#xD;
lite to make a man feel hi~ ignorance on subjects with which&#xD;
you happen to be well informed."&#xD;
"But vanity and ambition frequently prompt men to pa-&#xD;
rade literature, law, or philosophy, where such things are as&#xD;
much out of their clime as an orange grove would be in Lap-&#xD;
land."&#xD;
"Men of superior attainments are too prone to contemn&#xD;
the ordinary topics of common minds," said Colonel Mere-&#xD;
dith. "This is wrong. The merchant, thefarmer, the me-&#xD;
chanic, are as important persons in their departments as&#xD;
philosophers and slatesmen are in their places. The scholar&#xD;
has one species of intelligence, and men who are engaged in&#xD;
business have another. Though their tastes are unconge-&#xD;
iiial, they should not quarrel with and contemn each other,&#xD;
for each one is useful in his vocation, and the world needs&#xD;
both.' The student of bopks should keep his mind informed&#xD;
on subjects of general interest,~nd when in th~ street or the&#xD;
&#xD;
drawing-room, lay aside his learning and be as one of the&#xD;
multitude. A man only renders himself superlatively ridic-&#xD;
ulous by holding himself in cold isolation, apart from the men&#xD;
he meets, as if he were an emissary from the court of Jove,&#xD;
to see what inferior beings are engaged in. If the eagle&#xD;
will sail down from his solitary perch and mingle with the&#xD;
birds in the forests, let him take part in their sports; if he&#xD;
can not do this, let him ascend to the craggy cliffs of his&#xD;
mountain home, and remain there."&#xD;
CHAPTER XLI.&#xD;
WHEN IDrayton left Colonel Meredith, he repaired to his&#xD;
chamber, and feeling no disposition to sleep, took a seat at&#xD;
the window and looked out on the scene. The moon was&#xD;
up, the winds were soft, and the rippling of the waves break-&#xD;
ing on the shore of the river audible. lt is at such a time&#xD;
that the tendency to indulge in. revery is almost irresistible*&#xD;
with minds that are prone to castle-building. It was very&#xD;
common with Drayton to spend an hour after the excitement&#xD;
of the day were over in that sort of architecture; and while&#xD;
sitting at the window with the gentle winds fluttering on&#xD;
his brow, he began to muse on things which were past, and&#xD;
on his hopes and expectations. First came up before his&#xD;
mind the beautiful features and form of Ellen Meredith; and&#xD;
as he revolved many kind 'words she had spoken to him dii-&#xD;
ring the evening, his 'heart swelled with delight. Her con-&#xD;
duct toward him had always been most respectful; but&#xD;
whether she entertained any other feeling than that of re-&#xD;
spect for him, was matter for very unsatisfying conjectures.&#xD;
As he thought of those innumerable occurrences which shad-&#xD;
ow forth undivulged feelings, on which lovers dwell so anx-&#xD;
iously, he was much perplexed to assign them to their proper&#xD;
sources; but, as he recounted over several kindnesses of&#xD;
speech and manner he had observed of late; he thought it was&#xD;
not impossible that the esteem she felt for him might mature&#xD;
into love. He well knew she exerted too faithful a vigilance&#xD;
over her heart to suffer what she 'wished to conceal to man-'&#xD;
ifest itself prematurely. After balancing all these consid-&#xD;
erations, he' avrived at that conclusion to which the co~uess&#xD;
L2&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7761-00000126"/>&#xD;
DRAYTON.&#xD;
of ladies generally forces their lovers, that she would not&#xD;
satisfy him as to the nature of the feelings his attentions&#xD;
had excited in her bosom prior to a declaration of love of the&#xD;
most unretractable kind from his lips. Her feelings were&#xD;
not like those shallow ones which on all occasions flush the&#xD;
cheek and light the eye, which clothe the brQw with sad-&#xD;
ness~ and express themselves in the language of sighs; and&#xD;
he felt assured that no ingenious artifices on his part would&#xD;
develop a passion of hers if she harbored one for him. The&#xD;
stern and awful necessity of a confession of love stared him&#xD;
in the face, and then he began to meditate on the propriety&#xD;
of such a course. He had essayed every means in his power&#xD;
to please and- interest her, and he felt he had not been un-&#xD;
successful, for she listened most attentively to him when his&#xD;
prospects in life formed the theme on which he spoke, and,&#xD;
from her own expressions, it was obvious that she understood&#xD;
and sympathized with him, and most sincerely wished him&#xD;
success. She loved a~cnbition, and reverenced superior minds,&#xD;
and the hope of realizing in his own person the beau ideal&#xD;
of her mind afforded his exertions a strong incentive. Most&#xD;
softly ,had her praises of his recent speech fallen on his ear,&#xD;
and, while thinking of what she had said, he determined that&#xD;
he would give her occasion to repeat her cheering tones by&#xD;
making a very superior speech in behalf of Roger.&#xD;
To that unfortunate person his thoughts next turned. The&#xD;
trial was to come on in. two days, and he awaited it with all&#xD;
the. anxiety' and impatience common to young men in his&#xD;
situation. It would afford him an opportunity, such as he&#xD;
had long hoped for, for the exhibition of his intellectual pow-&#xD;
ers. It seemed to him, as he reflected on it, that the occa-&#xD;
sion would be the crisis of his fortunes-the turning-point of&#xD;
his destiny. If he succeeded as he desired, his effort might&#xD;
establish a forensic reputation for him which would hence-&#xD;
forth, cause wealth to flow into his coffers; but if ihe failed,&#xD;
the hopes which had cheered him through many a long and&#xD;
gloomy hour would be stricken and blackened, and a dark&#xD;
andLwintery night of desolation come down upon his heart.&#xD;
Such were some of the exciting electionss which passed&#xD;
rapidly through his mind as he sat looking out on the mo6n-&#xD;
lit scene. His brain was too much agit~.ted for sleep; and&#xD;
the hour and the scene were tempting for one who wished&#xD;
to reflect on the probable revelations of his destiny. He rose&#xD;
and went down, and in a few minutes was walking slowly'&#xD;
a~longthe bank of that river which was associated with many&#xD;
&#xD;
DLtAYTON;&#xD;
sweet reri~.embrarices of love-and friendship. His heart, j~ust&#xD;
then; *as not with the past; the future claimed his thoughts,&#xD;
and on it he dwelt with all that ardor of hope and expecta-&#xD;
tion whichis the frequent experience of the untried and~ en-&#xD;
thusiastic aspirant.&#xD;
The moon was shining in unclouded majesty high up in&#xD;
the heavens; the silvery expanse of the river, slightly agi-&#xD;
tated by the gentle winds, flashed here and there in the moon-&#xD;
beams; the gales and the waves came trooping in to the&#xD;
shore, murruaring their melodies softly to each other, which&#xD;
sounded to the fancy like the rich tones of the harps ~f spir-&#xD;
its roving abroad over the earth on missions of mercy; the&#xD;
holy calm ~vvhich reigned around was occasionally broken by&#xD;
the howl of the dog, or the hooting of some solitary owl in&#xD;
the depths of the woodland; the bright sky and the tran-&#xD;
quil earth-the old ruins on the opposite shore-~the hills in&#xD;
the backgrorind -the green island sleeping on the rivers&#xD;
bosom, formed one of the loveliest scenes, IDraytoi~, thought,&#xD;
that the world contained. Such was the magical influence&#xD;
of the place and the hour, that his mind was roused fromits&#xD;
abstraction, and, folding his arms across his chest, he stood&#xD;
on the verge of the sloping bank, and, glancing at the river,&#xD;
murmured,&#xD;
"Beautiful! most beautiful!. 'What an hour for poetry-&#xD;
what a scene for love! Nature to-night seems to have for-&#xD;
gotten her age, and is as fresh and as beautiful as she was&#xD;
before sin expelled man from Eden. Earth is pouring fortn&#xD;
a solemn hymn of thanks to the Author of her thrice ten&#xD;
thousand scenes of grandeur and loveliness. Every thing is&#xD;
as peaceful as if crime and evil had never stained the green&#xD;
fields of this world, nor shouts of human agony ascended&#xD;
from oppressed and dow~i-trod.den hearts. The ever bright&#xD;
and burning stars are as smiling as if no tearful eyes were&#xD;
now turned toward them, imploring mercy from that awful&#xD;
tribunal which is situated far beyond the most distant orbit.&#xD;
Beautiful-most beautiful' are earth and answering heaven!"&#xD;
His thoughts were soon abstracted from the beauty before&#xD;
him, and reverted to the approaching trial, the results of&#xD;
which were, as he imagined, to have so impQrtant an influ.~&#xD;
ence on his destinies. The court-house, with its judges,'its&#xD;
jurors, its witnesses,:its anxious multitude, rose before him.&#xD;
In fancy he heard the testimony given in, and he stood up&#xD;
the advocate of Roger. Sentence after sentence of a speech&#xD;
passed through his mind, and he thought that at that zilo.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7761-00000127"/>&#xD;
252                 DRAYTON.                                                              I) R A Y TO ~(.&#xD;
&#xD;
menthe ~uld have spoken in such a way as to command&#xD;
the admiration of thousands. He proceeded with his speech,&#xD;
and, becoming excited, he waved his arms vehemently and&#xD;
spoke aloud. The sounds of footsteps i'eached his ear, and,&#xD;
dropping his elevated arm in the middle of a sentence, he&#xD;
wheeled to see who was approaching. He saw the form of&#xD;
some one in the distance moving slowly onward. It passed&#xD;
into the shadows of the trees near the cemetery, and soon&#xD;
disappeared. He turned again to the river, and proceeded&#xD;
with his speech, words of which occasionally became audi-&#xD;
ble to a fancied jury and aerial crowd.&#xD;
Re took a seat where he had been ~with Miss Willoughby&#xD;
during the afternoon. His cheek was flushed, and his fore-&#xD;
head burned with excitement. His ardent feelings subsided&#xD;
in the refreshing breeze, and, forgetting his client, he began&#xD;
to dream over the loveliness of the prospect. Gracefully&#xD;
glided a vision of Ellen, wrought by his own fervid Thncy,&#xD;
to the seat beside him. Once more footsteps dissolved his&#xD;
dreams. They became more and more audible, and ~res-&#xD;
ently the form of Colonel Meredith emerged from the shad-&#xD;
ows and became visible in the moonlight. With his eye&#xD;
fixed o~i the ground before him, he advanced to the seat oe"~&#xD;
copied by Drayton, and was in the act of seating himself~&#xD;
when, discovering that he was not alone, he started back.&#xD;
"Colonel, do not be alarmed," said IDrayton. "When we&#xD;
parted an hour ago, I did not expect to have the pleasure&#xD;
of meeting you again to-night. I find mine is not the only.&#xD;
restless spirit at Oakwood. It was your form I saw-"&#xD;
He checked his words suddenly, for, glancing at the cob-&#xD;
nel's face, he discovered that he had been weeping. The&#xD;
colonel made a strong effort to suppress his emotions, and&#xD;
then, in a low, tremulous voice, said,&#xD;
"I fancied you were on your pillow long since. But the&#xD;
young heart will be restless when the moon is shedding ro-&#xD;
mnauce abroad on hill and river. I was romantic too when&#xD;
I was young; and I have sought the river's bank on many&#xD;
a glorious night like this, t~) give wing to my thoughts, and&#xD;
to dream of the happiness which was to crown my future&#xD;
lot. Alas! alas! a difThrent motive led me out to-night !"&#xD;
He bent his face toward the earth, and it waa evident he&#xD;
was wrestling with strong emotions. After a moment's si,&#xD;
lence, he added,&#xD;
"Often, at this solemn hour1 when the moon is up, I take&#xD;
a rrz~1azieholy pleasure in visiting yonder ~cemetery, azi4&#xD;
&#xD;
there shedding a tear to the memory of one whose love and&#xD;
devotion to me formed the light of my life through the~ vi-.&#xD;
cissitudes of many years. While standing near the sod&#xD;
which wraps her body, slumbering there in happy oblivion&#xD;
of its former sufferings, I always fancy that her gentle spirit&#xD;
is fluttering its wings near me. Is it not in perfect accord-&#xD;
ance with what we know of the merciful dispensations of&#xD;
the Father of Spirits, 4o believe he permits ~emancipated&#xD;
souls to wander back to earth, and whisper of the glories of&#xD;
the cloudless clime where they have found rest, into the ears&#xD;
of those who were most dear to them while imprisoned in&#xD;
their clay? Often, at the midnight hour, when silence wraps&#xD;
the earth as a garment, I have fancied I heard the spirit&#xD;
tones of that skinless soul to whom, in death as in life, my&#xD;
heart is devoted, breathing love, and peace, and joy to me."&#xD;
He paused again, and, elevating his eye toward a bright&#xD;
star which was glittering over the summit of a distant hill,&#xD;
he continued,&#xD;
"Oh, of all the form~ that I have seen or dreamed of,&#xD;
hers was the loveliest and most saint-like. A degrading&#xD;
thought never summoned the flush of shame to her cheek,&#xD;
~or ever did an impure passion stain the virgin whiteness of&#xD;
~i~r soul. More beautiful than the creations of poets, her&#xD;
~f'orm, so faultless, wa~ a befitting shrine for so pure a spirit.&#xD;
lit is now ten years since disease blighted, but could not de-&#xD;
stroy her exceeding beauty'; ten years since the rose faded&#xD;
frQm her check and music forsook her lips; ten years since&#xD;
the light of her eye grew dim and faint, vanishing like the&#xD;
warm tints of evening from the light cloud flo~.ting on the&#xD;
azure sea.&#xD;
He again hesitated as if to stifle his swelling emotions,&#xD;
and Drayton sympathized deeply with him while gazing on&#xD;
the mournful expression of his face, hallowed by the beams&#xD;
which shone upon it.&#xD;
"She died of the insidious disease which is now gnawing&#xD;
at my son's vitals. I had hoped to escape that affliction,&#xD;
but I fear it may not be. He, too, will soon be lost to earth,&#xD;
and his noble brow, so full of genius and purity, will be pale&#xD;
in the embrace of death. At times, the thought of such a&#xD;
bereavement comes oyer me with withering force, and I feel&#xD;
lik~ the weary traveler who falls exhausted to earth. While&#xD;
h~ and Ellen are left, I am pure that every sigh I utter will&#xD;
be~ echoed, and that I may still enjoy happy hours. He,&#xD;
denx, dear youth, must soon unfold the pinions of his spirit,&#xD;

arrd soar a~ra~r on an unretuming flight to those solemn&#xD;
shores to which his mother has preceded him. And then&#xD;
I shall be alone in the earth with Ellen! God support me&#xD;
he added, looking reverentially upward, "and let not my&#xD;
griefs.for the dead cause m~' to forget my duties to the liv-&#xD;
As he uttered' this ejaculation, he brushed the tears from&#xD;
his eyes, rose, and walked with' bended form and unsteady&#xD;
step slowly toward the house. As Drayton's eye followed&#xD;
that noble man, th~ pathos of his voice still'rang in his ear,&#xD;
and his own emotions were almost insupportable.&#xD;
Another hour passed before he sought his pillow. Rig&#xD;
excited and wayward fancies rendered hi&amp;amp; slumbers fitful,&#xD;
and lengthened out the solemn watches of the night.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLII.&#xD;
DRAYTON returned to the' city the ensuing morning, and&#xD;
went to the prison' to' see how his client 'fared.&#xD;
The unfortunate' Roger was' reclining on a pallet in a cell&#xD;
into which the light of day stole but dimly. Colonel Mer-&#xD;
edith, desirous of making his condition as agreeable as possi-&#xD;
ble, had caused 'him to be supplied wit'h many comforts not&#xD;
generally~met with in such places. 'The prisoner's appear-&#xD;
ance had undergone mpch change during his 'confinement.&#xD;
His mental sufferings' had been intense, as was evident from&#xD;
the wan and haggard expression of his face. His cheeks,&#xD;
fo~erly'ruddy and well' filled, where good humor and good&#xD;
health had dwelt so abidingly, were now thin, and sunken,&#xD;
and colorless. The eye, in which a love of fun formerly&#xD;
sparkled continually, was now restless in its hollow socket,&#xD;
and an' expression, blended of fear and anxiety, looked from&#xD;
it. His long and uncombed hair was matted over his fore~&#xD;
head, and his mouth, instead of the livery of smiles it had&#xD;
worn in his happier days, bore the impress of deep and set-&#xD;
tled g~rief. He was sobbing when Drayton entered the cell,&#xD;
and raised his head languidly to see who had intruded' ou&#xD;
his solitude. The heavy, expression of his 'face was some-&#xD;
what relieved by the sensation of pleasure which folhwed'a.&#xD;
recognition of his visitor, and he extended his hand and: shooJr&#xD;
Drayton's cordially.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
DIIAYT ON.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am very glad you've come," said the prisoner, in a fee-&#xD;
ble tone of voice. "I was afraid every body had forgotten&#xD;
me. What time is it? Last night was the longest one I&#xD;
ever saw, and I thought it never would come 'to an end. I&#xD;
had such frightful dreams," he continued, shuddering," and&#xD;
woke up every minute only to feel how lonely I was, and to&#xD;
see that there was no sign of the night's being' near over.&#xD;
I shall die if they keep me in this horrible place much&#xD;
longer."&#xD;
"Cheer up~. cheer up, my dear fellow! Brush the cob-'&#xD;
webs from your face, and look less melancholy. You are&#xD;
not so near' dead. as you think. Your lease on this room&#xD;
will expire to-morrow, and you'll sleep at Oakwood after to.~&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"Do you really think there's a pretty good chance of my&#xD;
getting clear ?" asked Roger, with a wild glare of anxiety in&#xD;
his eye as he spoke4 '"Oh, I was dreaming all night about&#xD;
being hung, while crowds of people were staring and laugh-&#xD;
ing at me. I'd rather die than ~spend such another night."&#xD;
"You must compose your mind, and not suffer your fears&#xD;
to conjure up such dreams. There is' no probability of your&#xD;
standing on a scaffold yet a while. You were not born to&#xD;
die, like one of the fishes you used to catch, at the end of a&#xD;
line.&#xD;
"That'S just the way Colonel Meredith ~talks to me al-&#xD;
;ways; but still I can't help thinking that maybe things may&#xD;
take a~ different turn from what you expect. Every body&#xD;
don't know me as well as you do."&#xD;
"If they did, there would be no occasion for your fears,"&#xD;
said Drayton, anxious to mitigate his despondency. "We&#xD;
know very well that you would be as far from committing a&#xD;
willful murder as any other person. But cheer up, and don't&#xD;
look so wo-begone. Do not suffer your unfounded dreams to~&#xD;
frighten your. senses away.. There is no doubt of your being&#xD;
acquitted , and in less than two days you will be snuffing&#xD;
the fresh air of the country, attending to your business, and&#xD;
as blithe and as happy as' a bird."&#xD;
"Not happy-..--not happy," said the prisoner, shaking his&#xD;
head, as if he thought the fulfillment of Drayton's a~iticipa-&#xD;
tions was impossible. "I used' to be happy there," he con-&#xD;
tinued,, looking mournfully down on the floor, "but I can't&#xD;
be so again. No, no, my heart is too much broken for that.&#xD;
I can hardly help crying.when I think how happy I used to&#xD;
be and how miserable. I am now. I can hardly believe~ I&#xD;

25~                 DRAYTON.&#xD;
am the same man. II usedto be so happy at Oakwood ~t1&#xD;
dTay, for I knew that when the sun went doWn and the stars&#xD;
began to peep out, I could walk over to the little cottage&#xD;
there by the road side, and wher~ I got there, there was al-&#xD;
ways some one there who looked so smiling and so glad to&#xD;
see, me, that I ~couldn't h~p being happy. But, sir, if I am&#xD;
cleared, I can never go to that place again, for I'm sure my&#xD;
heart would break if I was to go there. She is gone, and&#xD;
the flowers don't grow there as they used to, and I shouldn't&#xD;
wonder if the birds had all gone away too; for who is left&#xD;
there to enjoy their songs? But," he continued, turning his&#xD;
thoughts abruptly into a different channel, "but don't you:&#xD;
think the lawyers will manage to make me out a great ras-&#xD;
cal, and then the jury Will think that I deserve to be hung ?"&#xD;
"There is no danger of such a result," replied iDrayton.&#xD;
"I can say as many things in your favor, if necessary, as the&#xD;
lawyers, whom you seem to dread, can say against you. Let&#xD;
them say '~rhat they please, they can not convict you of mur-&#xD;
der in the first or second degree. There is no blood on your&#xD;
conscience, and if you will control your imagination, which&#xD;
seems to have a strange propensity to torture you, you may&#xD;
still live and be as happy as you were a year ago, when&#xD;
every thing was bright before you. What have you here ?"&#xD;
he added, directing his attention to a basket which contain-&#xD;
ed some little delicacies for the prisoner's palate. "You&#xD;
live pretty comfortably after all, and there are plenty of&#xD;
men out of jail who would exchange places with you very&#xD;
willingly."&#xD;
"Miss Ellen is very kind, sir," replied Roger, "and sends&#xD;
something she thinks I'd like almost every day. I wonder&#xD;
why she should think of such a poor, rough, despised creature&#xD;
as I am? But* it's a part of her nature to be kind, as it is&#xD;
a cricket's to make a noise. If there ever was an angel,&#xD;
she's oWe. I wish I could do something for her, if it was&#xD;
only to show her that, if I am rough in my manners, I am&#xD;
not roi~gh at heart."&#xD;
"She takes great interest in your welfare; and you will&#xD;
be as heartily welcomed back to Qakwood by her as by any&#xD;
other person there."&#xD;
"Do you i~uppose there'll be many people at my trial ?"&#xD;
"People have talked a great deal about it, and I have no&#xD;
doubt a large multitude will be at the court-house to look&#xD;
at you," replied Drayton. " You must keep yourself com-&#xD;
posed, and look like an innocent man."&#xD;
&#xD;
~RAYTON~                    2~7&#xD;
"I can't lear the thought of being stuck up tQ be looked&#xD;
at by every body. Every one will have something to say&#xD;
about jiow much I took like a guilty wretch. They'll say&#xD;
they could have sworn beforehand that I would as lief cut a&#xD;
man's throat as not, from x~iy bad countenance, when, if they&#xD;
knew ai~iy thuii~g about me, they woi4d say that if Hampton&#xD;
hadn't drawn his pistol on me, IL would never have dreamed&#xD;
of wounding him. I did mean to whip him, but, it is as&#xD;
true as there's a sun in Heaven, I didn't mean to kill him.&#xD;
I wanted to beat him because be had made a poor, innocent&#xD;
girl unhappy for life; and I do think I'd have, been a cow-&#xD;
ard if I hadn't attempted to whip him for her sake; when&#xD;
she had no brother, and begged me to -do it former."&#xD;
"All these facts in relation to your intention will appear&#xD;
during your trial, and the jury must, of necessity, acquit you.&#xD;
It is necessary the witnesses shall prove that you were im-&#xD;
pelled by some bloody design in seeking Hampton-that you&#xD;
murdered him because you had determined to do so - that&#xD;
you killed him maliciously and not in self-defense, before&#xD;
the jury can bring in a verdict which will hang you. This&#xD;
can not be proved, and, of course,. you must be cleared."&#xD;
"But can't they, and won't they lie about me ?" inquired&#xD;
Roger. "Can't they make me out a willful murderer ?"&#xD;
"They can not. You trouble yourself too much -by imag-&#xD;
ining that every body and all the chances are opposed to&#xD;
you. Give yourself no more uneasiness, and wait patiently&#xD;
until to-morrow. Just keep a good heart, and all will end&#xD;
well."&#xD;
He left Roger and went in search of an office, for he knew,&#xD;
from his uncle's inflexible will, that he would not permit&#xD;
him to remain in the one that he occupied. Not finding&#xD;
one to suit him, he returned to the place where he had been&#xD;
during his residence in the city, and gave his mind uThto hi~&#xD;
studies until the shades of evening were again on the earth.&#xD;
He passed another restless night, and rose early on the en-&#xD;
suing morning with a headache. He ate no breakfast, and,&#xD;
notwithstanding his efforts to regain his wanted composure,&#xD;
his mind remained in a state of feverish excitement.&#xD;
As the hour for the meeting of the court approached, his&#xD;
excitability increased. He looked with an anxious eye on&#xD;
the groups of persons who were proceeding toward the place&#xD;
of trial. He s6on followed the current, accompanied by Sin-&#xD;
gleton, who looked forward to the effort his friend was about&#xD;
to make with unshaken confidence, for, since listening to&#xD;

hum at the political meeting, he had rated his ability very&#xD;
high, and did not doubt that the speech he would make that&#xD;
~day would place him in the front rank of young advoc~.tes.&#xD;
He observed Drayton's nervousness, and tried to calm it, al-&#xD;
though he feared no evil consequences from it, for he knew&#xD;
it did not result so much from any timidity a~ from the many&#xD;
hopes and strong feelings which were acting on him. Ar- (J&#xD;
rived at the court-house, Drayton tried to disguise the con-&#xD;
cern he felt by talking on indifferent subjects with the law:&#xD;
yers who were there assembled; but a quick sagacity would&#xD;
have discovered in the unusual rapidity of his speech and&#xD;
the occasional aberrations of his eye, a sure index of the na-&#xD;
ture and intensity of the feelings which were struggling in&#xD;
his bosom.&#xD;
At length the judges took their seats, the jury was sWorn,&#xD;
the 'indictment read, and all the preliminaries gone through&#xD;
with. The prisoner was brought forward, and pleaded not&#xD;
guilty to the charges contained in the indictirrent. The im-&#xD;
mense crowd pressed forward in their eagerness to get a look&#xD;
at Roger, who, unable to maintain his composure, covered&#xD;
his face with his hands, while his sickening emotions almost&#xD;
overpowered him. It was at this moment that Colonel&#xD;
Meredith approached the table around which the gentlemen&#xD;
of the bar were seated. The extreme courtesy which his le-&#xD;
gal brethren extended, indicated the profound respect they&#xD;
entert~dned. for him. He grasped IDrayton's hand warmly,&#xD;
and, after whispering a word of encouragement in his ear,&#xD;
took' a seat near him.&#xD;
~The witnesses Were examined, and the prosecuting attor-&#xD;
ney, a n~an of great skill and ingenuity, rose, and in an elab-&#xD;
orate speech tried to fasten the charges contained in the 'in-&#xD;
dictment on the prisoner. Roger moved about in his seat,&#xD;
rnbled with fear at the dismal coloring which the&#xD;
prosecutor threw over his conduct. At th~ conclusion of his&#xD;
speech,, nearly every person in the immense crowd fancied&#xD;
/      the case' of the prisoner desperate. His effort was masterly&#xD;
-his argument rose like a tower of strength.-.~.in proportion&#xD;
and intellectual masonry it seemed perfect-~-.-and a vast ma-&#xD;
jority of those who heard it deemed it altogether impreg-&#xD;
nabl~ to any assault.&#xD;
'That there was one eye which scanned its proportions most&#xD;
closely, and diseovered~that, however formidable its structure&#xD;
and appearance might be, its foundations were insecure.&#xD;
*     Drayton saw the flimsiness of his' premises, and, while he&#xD;
&#xD;
fl~IATTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
admired the logical ingenuity which was manifested in sup~&#xD;
porting them, he knew the eflbrt was open to attack in many&#xD;
poin~ts. He listened with burning anxiety to every sentence&#xD;
the counsel for the state uttered, and before it was conclude&#xD;
ed he had quite forgotten the novelty of his situation in his&#xD;
intense interest in the fate of the accused. As soon as the&#xD;
prosecutor finished, panting with the desire to vindicate his&#xD;
client, he sprang impulsively forward into the arena, eager to&#xD;
overwhelm the argument which had just been pronounced.&#xD;
Without a moment's hesitation, he commenced. Without&#xD;
exordium or preliminary flourish, he entered immediately into&#xD;
an examination of the merits of the case. Sentence after&#xD;
sentence flashed rapidly from his lips. His impassioned tones&#xD;
rang over the multitude pressing forward with anxious faces&#xD;
to see the speaker. A profound silence was maintained, and&#xD;
every eye was turned on the orator. His clear and distinct&#xD;
enunciation-his appropriate language-the fervor and ve-&#xD;
hemence of his manner-the felicity of his illustrations, and,&#xD;
above all, the nervous~ and on-sweeping eloquence, which&#xD;
dashed like an ocean-tide against the tower of argument&#xD;
which the prosecutor had so skillfully built up, washing&#xD;
away its foundations, and causing it to totter and reel on its&#xD;
base, excited and fixed all attention on him. When he com-&#xD;
menced the vindication ef his abused client, the sympathies&#xD;
of the multitude were evidently in Roger's favor, and the pris~&#xD;
oner elevated his head and felt secure. He concluded his&#xD;
speech, and sank hack on his seat in a state of exhaustion,&#xD;
scarcely hearing the murmurs of applause which ran through&#xD;
the crowd, and which were becoming clamorous, when the&#xD;
voice of the judge arrested them.&#xD;
In charging the jury, the judge took occasion to speak of&#xD;
the ability which had been displayed by the counsel, and ob-&#xD;
served that, "though he had witnessed many brilliant orts&#xD;
from debutante, 'it gave him great pleasure to -say that no&#xD;
one had ever afforded him more delight than that which had&#xD;
been made by the counsel for the prisoner, and had excited&#xD;
so much attention."&#xD;
The jury retired, and returned in a few minutes with a&#xD;
verdict of not guilty for the prisoner.&#xD;
Drayton's feelings were of the most triumphant kind. Con-&#xD;
gratulation after congratulation was tendered to him, but he&#xD;
listened' to none with so much satisfaction as that which Cob&#xD;
onel Meredith offered.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIII.&#xD;
ON the day after the trial, Drayton was making arrange-&#xD;
ments for changing his office, when, much to his surprise,&#xD;
one of his uncle's servants brought him a note, sealed and&#xD;
directed with the most fastidious punctiliousness. It was&#xD;
written with an unsteady pen, and read as follows:&#xD;
"To FRANK DRAYTON, EsQ.&#xD;
"DEAR SIR,--I have heard your speech at the court-house&#xD;
(which .1 regret I had not the happiness of 'hearing) highly&#xD;
commended by men of judgment. It gives me the most un.-&#xD;
alloyed satisfaction to know that, although you appeared to&#xD;
be so indifferent to my advice, you had the good sense to act&#xD;
upon it. You will always find inc ready to assist you in&#xD;
that way.(or in any other), provided yoware willing to assist&#xD;
yourself. In consequence of the honorable change (so grat-&#xD;
ifying to ~me) which has come over you, I have seen fit (on&#xD;
due consideration) to retract what I said hastily when I last&#xD;
saw you, and hope that you will continue to occupy the of-&#xD;
fice you now hold.&#xD;
"If you will go on in the good way you have begun, you&#xD;
will show yourself worthy of the' proud (the Macdonald)&#xD;
blood which circulates in your veins. I knew that your eye,&#xD;
which is extremely like that which is the inheritance of the&#xD;
family, could not dwell long, with any pleasure, on the&#xD;
strange course you have pursued of late; and I also knew&#xD;
that it must, from its very nature, soon look with contempt&#xD;
on all those d-.-d plebeian Democratic assemblages, at one&#xD;
of which you lately (forgetting your blood) condescended to&#xD;
officiate so conspicuously. I trust you have already repented&#xD;
that youthful folly, and will soon learn to hate the ragged-&#xD;
shirt ruffian Democrats as' much as if that was the disguise&#xD;
of the devil himself.&#xD;
"I have the honor to be&#xD;
"Your obedient servant,         M.D.&#xD;
"ALEXANDER MACDONALD,&#xD;
"N.B.-Whenever it suits your inclination, and leisure, I&#xD;
shall be liappyto congra.tulat&amp;amp; you in person on your recent&#xD;
success."&#xD;
&#xD;
Th~ayton read this note over several times, and concluded&#xD;
he had better humor the whims of the testy old gentleman,&#xD;
as far as was consistent with his feelings of pride and inde-&#xD;
pendence. When he called, he was careful not to say a&#xD;
word in defense of the rascally Democrats, who occasionally&#xD;
came in for large allowances of his uncle's spleen. The&#xD;
doctor seemed to be fully persuaded that if his nephew chose&#xD;
to act as weJ~ as he knew how, assisted by a little sage ad-&#xD;
vice from hint ;elf, he would become a very respectable mem-&#xD;
ber of the human family, and be not altogether unworthy of*&#xD;
the proud blood of the Macdonalds which his heart had the&#xD;
honor to contain.&#xD;
One of the effects of Drayton's speech in behalf of Roger&#xD;
was to attract attention to him as a lawyer. Within the&#xD;
ensuing week he had the satisfaction to be retained as coun-&#xD;
sel in several important cases. The efforts he had made&#xD;
were much talked of, and many wondered whythey had not&#xD;
sooner discovered evidences of his superior intellectual pow-&#xD;
ers; as if such powers could display themselves on the most&#xD;
unimportant occasions. It 'is amusing to observe persons&#xD;
after some one has sprung up from their midst, and suddenly&#xD;
exhibited uncommon ability. Their ingenuity is sorely puz-&#xD;
zled to assign a reason ~why they have not previously per-&#xD;
ceived in him the mark and the bearing of one who has&#xD;
been endowed with superior attributes. Many will say, as&#xD;
the good people about Drayton said, th~it it is only a chance&#xD;
hit, and that the aspirant will never reach such elevation in&#xD;
any of his subsequent efforts; while others will shake their&#xD;
omniscient heads gravely, and declare they always suspected&#xD;
he possessed extraordinary mind, and, had their opinions been&#xD;
asked, would have predicted the result which has taken&#xD;
place long before it happened~&#xD;
Drayton cared but little about the various sage surmises&#xD;
of the Solomons around him in relation to himself. He was.&#xD;
satisfied with knowing that his speeches were considered ex-&#xD;
traordinary efforts by many competent judges. That they&#xD;
had realized all? the expectations that he had cherished, was&#xD;
evident to him from the~fact that business began to present&#xD;
itself to him. Instead of resting contented with what he&#xD;
had already done, his success only inspired him with the de-&#xD;
sire of doing more, and to this end he applied himself to his&#xD;
studies industriously.&#xD;
A load was lifted from his heart, and the clouds which&#xD;
overhung the horizon of the future were brushed &amp;amp;#ide. He&#xD;
&#xD;
261&#xD;

262                  DR~YT~N~&#xD;
felt confidence in himself. He felt assured that the success&#xD;
of his career, so. auspiciously begun, now depended solely on&#xD;
his own exertions. The difficuLty which is the most formi-&#xD;
dable in the way of aspirants is to get a~ favorable starting-&#xD;
place; after that, if they bieak down in the ,race, their fail-&#xD;
ure is attributable to some weakness of1lirnb, the result of&#xD;
which they had not the shrewdness to foresee. Th~ayton&#xD;
breathed freely, for he was convinced thaVa competent sup.&#xD;
port was within his reach, and. the fame )ie~burned for did&#xD;
not seem to be so difficult or so distant a~ achievement as&#xD;
he had previously deemed it.&#xD;
On his first visit~ to Oakwood after the trial, he thought&#xD;
his greetings were warmer than they had been before.&#xD;
Every member of the excellent family of the Merediths&#xD;
spoke enthusiastically in favor of his speech. The praises&#xD;
which the colonel and George uttered were extremely grate-&#xD;
ful, but they did not afford a tithe of the delight he felt&#xD;
while drinking in tile warm encomiums which fell from El-&#xD;
len's lips, spoken in that sweet and melodious voice for which&#xD;
she was remarkable, while a flush overspread her cheek, as&#xD;
if there was an mtenser feeling at her heart than her words&#xD;
conveyed.&#xD;
It was ordained from, the beginning that no human eleva-&#xD;
tion should be above the reach of sadness. In the midst of&#xD;
all the high. and gratifying feelings which his recent success&#xD;
had caused, among ot1~ier sources of painful reflection, the&#xD;
condition of his friend, George Meredith, occasioriedhim abid-&#xD;
ing and heartfelt grief. That noble youth was rapidly ap-&#xD;
proaching the end of his existence. His form was no longer&#xD;
seen among his favorite haunts; disease had prostrated his&#xD;
physical powers, and he was confined to his room. There&#xD;
every thing was done which affection and taste could devise&#xD;
to mitigate his sufferings and smooth his descent to the grave.&#xD;
At times his pangs were excruciating, but generally he was&#xD;
so free of pain as to forget his situation, and to talk cheer-&#xD;
fully on subjects which could but for a little while loi~ger&#xD;
engage his attention. Drayton sat by his side through the&#xD;
watches of many nights, in obedience to his own feelings and&#xD;
the expressed wishes of his friend.&#xD;
One night in August-Drayton was alone with him. The&#xD;
family had retired, and George felt indisposed to sleep. The&#xD;
moonbeams were streaming in through the windows, and*&#xD;
the sounds of the waves, breaking on the river's shore, rose&#xD;
gently on the s6lenin silence of the midnight. George Was&#xD;
&#xD;
~AYT0N.                      263&#xD;
reclining in an easy chair, and as the lamp shone on his pale&#xD;
and wasted face, ~ts expression was pure and serene. His&#xD;
eye, unshadowed, amid the ravages of disease, still retained&#xD;
its brilliancy. Drayton had bec~,reading to him, but now&#xD;
sat with the book -in his hand, conversing on subjects of mu-&#xD;
tual interest to them. The invalid turned his eyes ~slowly&#xD;
toward ihe window, and gazed for a moment in silent ab-&#xD;
straction out on the: n~oQnlit prospect.&#xD;
"It i~ a beautij~*~ ~iight !" remarked George, feebly, but&#xD;
still audibly. "U i~ ~ne of those nights on which earth and&#xD;
sky seem to approecli each other- when every thing is as&#xD;
peaceful as the folded wing of a seraph~ and the air seems&#xD;
to be peopled with spirits and melodious with a thousand&#xD;
distant lyres. Move my c1~iair, my dear friend, nearer, a lit-&#xD;
tle nearer the window, that I may, perhaps for the last time,&#xD;
look out on the river and the hills I love so much sleeping&#xD;
in the moonbeams.~~&#xD;
Drayton complied with his request, and he continued:&#xD;
"How very mysterious are the sympathies between the soul&#xD;
of man and external nature! Howe at times, the streams,&#xD;
the bjrds, the hills, the winds, all seem to respond to our own&#xD;
feelings. The stars stoop down from their incomprehensible&#xD;
heights, and whisper to our minds of all they have been the&#xD;
witnesses to since first they shouted their praises over the&#xD;
birth of this world, and, touching our souls as with the wand&#xD;
of the prophet, cause the future to spread out its events be-&#xD;
fore our vision. The spirit of man shrinks from the glare of&#xD;
day, but. goes forth to revel among unutterable glories under&#xD;
the wing of night. How many delights have I experienced&#xD;
at seasons like-this! My career has been lint limited, and&#xD;
yet, if I were to measure its duration by the sum of my en-&#xD;
joyments, it would seem to be a long one."&#xD;
"A long life is desirable ouly because it affords more&#xD;
chances for happiness,." said Drayton; "and when many en-&#xD;
jO~ments have been crowded into a span, instead of being&#xD;
satisfied with our experience, we only the more earnestly de-&#xD;
sire to live, and can not feel entirely resigned to part forever&#xD;
'from scenes endeared to usty so many pleasing associations."&#xD;
'~Your remark is true in the general, but not applicable&#xD;
to any~particular instance," said George. . " I have an~abid-&#xD;
ing faith in the doctrine which teaches that, when my spirit&#xD;

scenes where there is no grief and no fear of change. But&#xD;
oh! I can not but regret to leave a few who are very dear&#xD;

&#xD;
to me-my father, my sweet sister, and the bride of my heart!&#xD;
I frequently shudder when I attempt to anticipate the grief&#xD;
which will overwhelm my Caroline. What sources of hap-&#xD;
piness ~Will be hers? How will her smitten and confiding&#xD;
spirit be supported, when it awakens to a full consciousness&#xD;
of its loneliness? Though a thousand friends may smile on&#xD;
us, when the one we love is gone we can feel no happiness.&#xD;
When I parted from her this evening, and saw the tear in&#xD;
her eye, I felt how closely the tendrils of her heart were in*&#xD;
tertwiued with my existence. There is but one Source from&#xD;
which the fainting mourner can derive support, and oh! may&#xD;
that be open to her petitions !"&#xD;
"She is far too wise to be ignorant of the source to which&#xD;
you allude, and if it must be that her heart shall be strick-&#xD;
en, she will undoubtedly have recourse to its healing waters,"&#xD;
added Drayton, with much tenderness, while his face gave&#xD;
evidence of the intensity of his sympathies.&#xD;
"That knowledge is of incalculable value to me at this&#xD;
moment," said George. "At such an hour as this, when the&#xD;
walls of its mortal mansion are crumbling around the soul,&#xD;
how invaluable is the faith which assures us that the Power&#xD;
which fashioned will not desert us, and will sustain those&#xD;
who arC about to be bereaved! This faith supports savage&#xD;
and civilized man alike in the trying hour of death. Though&#xD;
the forms in which it is recognized differ, yet is its efficacy&#xD;
the same."&#xD;
His countenance was radiant with a light which seemed&#xD;
too pure to be of this earth as he spoke, and though his voice&#xD;
was very feeble, and his articulation faltering and almost in.&#xD;
distinct, it was evident that decay had' not touched his vig-&#xD;
orous mind. With his face turned to the window, he added,&#xD;
"I do not know why it should be so, but, all day long&#xD;
I have fancied that my hour was approaching, and a sound&#xD;
as' of the clod falling on my coffin-lid has been ringing in my&#xD;
ears. At this moment I feel a pressure almost suffocating&#xD;
here," he said, lifting his hand with difficulty to his breast,&#xD;
"which admonishes me that I ought to lie down. But I can&#xD;
not. I must look out on the night a little longer.~~&#xD;
A pause ofa few' minutes followed, which was broken by&#xD;
*George, who reqne~ted his friend to move his chair still nearer&#xD;
the window. This having been done, the eye of the invalid&#xD;
was directed to the family burying-ground, which was dis-&#xD;
tirietly visible in the bright moonbeams.&#xD;
"Yonder lies the spot where my body must very soon re-&#xD;
&#xD;
pose, and above it are shining those numberless worlds among&#xD;
*which my soul may soop. wander," said George. ~' How oft-&#xD;
en have I glanced from that ground to those worlds, feeling&#xD;
at the time forcibly the grand truth that my spirit is imper-&#xD;
ishable. On such occasions my thoughts do not linger around&#xD;
the sod where what was mortal of the departed is m~il4er-.&#xD;
ing. They spring from earth to sky. I have frequently, at&#xD;
such times, become so absorbed in contemplation of heaven,&#xD;
and the bright band of friends who have gone there before&#xD;
me, that the present seemed distant and the distant present.&#xD;
I left the living then, and lived only with the dead."&#xD;
"There are some very excellent Christians," remarked&#xD;
Drayton, "who discourage that sentiment which attaches one&#xD;
to the turf beneath which a friend slumbers."&#xD;
," It may be easy for some persons to center their thoughts&#xD;
in the grave, and thus forget the spirit of a friend while dw~ll-&#xD;
ing on his dust," added George; "but I am not of them.&#xD;
The sentiment you speak of is both natural and .beautiful.&#xD;
When the good Jacob was about to give up the ghost in&#xD;
Egypt, his heart, yearned toward his departed kindred, and&#xD;
he directed that his body should be buried in the cave in&#xD;
which his forefathers were' buried in Canaan. The Turks&#xD;
and our Indians exhibit great reverence for their burial-&#xD;
grounds. Christians should not crush, but direct this senti-&#xD;
ment; and then, under its beautiful ministrations, they will&#xD;
cling fast to the goad in the character of departed friends.&#xD;
When in our burial-ground, I think less of what those dear&#xD;
friends were than of what they now are. r forget their life-&#xD;
struggles, and ponder on their immortal joys."&#xD;
Drayton was deeply interested in the conversation, and, to&#xD;
encourage his friend to go on, he said,&#xD;
"I have heard of instances of persons who, when on ~he&#xD;
eve of departing from this life, seemed to have a singulaifl~'~&#xD;
clear view of that higher life which was before them. As&#xD;
their eyes grew dim to earth, they brightened in the beams&#xD;
of heaven."&#xD;
"iVEy sainted mother was one of that iaappy class," said&#xD;
George. "Before she left us, heaven was very near her. At&#xD;
times a remarkable light was on her face, which, added to&#xD;
its usual serenity and sweetness, struck all who saw her.&#xD;
She felt the presence of angels, less palpable than the angel&#xD;
was to the eye of, the patriarch, but still visible to' her inner&#xD;
eye. The joy 'of such moments, though her body was criun-&#xD;
bling before the force of her disease, was too great f~r utter-&#xD;

ance. Our language is rich in its power of describing earth-&#xD;
bbrn feelings, but it does not enable a profound spiritualist&#xD;
to ~describe the bliss he desires from heavenly communion.&#xD;
We xnust be"'taught of the angels before we can do that.&#xD;
We must learn the language ~f heaven before we can speak&#xD;
with accuracy of heavenly delights."&#xD;
U The convictions of some persons, when approaching death,&#xD;
have more force than while in health," said Drayton. "Faith&#xD;
strengthens as the body decays. There are some who deride&#xD;
the belief in spiritual interposition, but I can not help think-&#xD;
ing that the man is very foolish who laughs at a beautiful&#xD;
faith-a faith which is proof against despair-which tri-&#xD;
umphs over pain and the ravages of disease, and sustains the&#xD;
spirit while death is rudely breaking the ligaments which&#xD;
bound it to the flesh. There is no compensation in philoso-&#xD;
phy for the absence of a faith like that-a faith which makes&#xD;
a sick woman a true heroine in circumstances in which a&#xD;
philosopher is appalled and shivers with apprehensions.~~&#xD;
"You speak the truth-.--the invaluable truth, my friend,"&#xD;
6aid George. "I have had much ill health;' and have been&#xD;
very near death. I have tested the strength of reason and&#xD;
philosophy, and found it utterly insufficient. Had there been&#xD;
no power abler to sustain me, I should long since have fallen&#xD;
to earth despairing in what would then have seemed to me&#xD;
the dark and unmeaning path of life. A firm reliance on&#xD;
the outstretched arm of our heavenly Father is the only re-&#xD;
liance that is proof against despair in all thevicissitudes of&#xD;
life and the hour of death. If such faith is fiction, then is&#xD;
fiction infinitely stronger than all the facts connected with&#xD;
human existence. Man is certainly the poorest of all poor&#xD;
creatures, if a fiction has more power to sustain him than all&#xD;
the truths that science and philosophy have evolved along&#xD;
the track of ages. Fiction, indeed! Faith is the great so-&#xD;
lar fact in the spiri1~ual system, from whose 1~eams all other&#xD;
facts catch the light and the warmth that are necessary to~&#xD;
them."&#xD;
George's utterance here became very weak, and Drayton&#xD;
advised him, to be silent. With his eyes fixed on the stars,&#xD;
he seemed t6 be absorbed in profound meditation for sev-&#xD;
eral minutes, when he slowly said,&#xD;
"How s~tendid JmpIt~r looks tonight! Perhaps at this&#xD;
moment some' expiring victim of disease maybe looking from&#xD;
that~plauet toward this earth for the last time."&#xD;
f~e hesitated a moment~ and added,&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.                    2~T&#xD;
"The brightness is leaving the planet. A mist seems to&#xD;
be gathering over its face. Is it not growing cloudy and&#xD;
9"&#xD;
chilly. the cloud was gathering on the eye of the invalid,&#xD;
Alas&#xD;
arid the planet was still shining brightly in the far blue sky.&#xD;
In another moment the head drooped, the hand fell, the rat.&#xD;
tie in the throat was heard, and all was over!&#xD;
Two days afterward the body of George was laid in the&#xD;
family burying-ground. An immense concourse of people&#xD;
assembled at Oakwood to pay the last sad tribute of respect&#xD;
to his memory.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIV.&#xD;
THE unresting wing of time hurries on over human joys&#xD;
and human woes alike, and though its shadow seems to liii-&#xD;
ger and deepen on hearts where grief~1ias found an abiding&#xD;
place, yet even there it is not perpetual. With the major-&#xD;
ity of our species, afflictions, howeVer violent their eWects~&#xD;
for a season, soon expend themselves, laying scarcely a scar&#xD;
behind to tell that suffering has been ihere. But the his-&#xD;
tory of all afflictions may not thus briefly be written. There&#xD;
are natures which, once having mourned, do not forget, and&#xD;
over these the sanative influences of years, though felt, are&#xD;
not thoroughly effective.' On such persons, grief takes such&#xD;
deep hold, and makes such ineffaceable impression, that the&#xD;
Lethean waves of time pass oi~er their turn hearts as the&#xD;
ocean tides pass over the fissures of the unyielding rocks~&#xD;
leaving the marks of their sorrows unworn.&#xD;
Though long expected, the death of George Meredith was&#xD;
a bereavement not easy to be forgotten. The remembrance&#xD;
of his many virtues survived, though his form had vanished;&#xD;
and long and deep was the sorrow occasioned by his loss.&#xD;
Time, it is true, mitigated ~what it could 'not destroy, and&#xD;
grief still lingered in the hearts which'had kn4~wn him most&#xD;
intimately, Iong after its shadows had ceased to rest heavily&#xD;
on the eyes of his friends, and its plaintive tones had forsaken&#xD;
their tongues.&#xD;
utumn, with its blighting influences, passed over the&#xD;
mountains and the plains, and the frosts of winter had given&#xD;
way before the balmy breath of spring. The soe~iera;o~ui4&#xD;

2~8                   DILAYTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
Oakwood was reclothed in its beauty; and although a sense&#xD;
of loneliness at times weighed heavily on the hearts of Col-&#xD;
onel Meredith and his daughter, yet they were generally&#xD;
cheerful. 'The father found solace for many an hour, other-&#xD;
wise gloomy, among his books, and Ellen had many employ-&#xD;
ments with which to occupy her days. Drayton continued&#xD;
to visit them regularly, and~i0 presence had become so in-&#xD;
dispensable, that regrets 'and disappointments were expressed&#xD;
whenever a few consecutive days passed without a visit&#xD;
from 'him.&#xD;
Great was the change which a year had produced in 'his&#xD;
fee~Iings and prospects. When, on the opening of spring, he&#xD;
compared his situation with what ~t had been a year pre-&#xD;
viously, he could not but congratulate himself on the success&#xD;
of his exertiQr&amp;amp; One short year before, he was often de-&#xD;
'sponding; now he was buoyant with expectation. Then he&#xD;
was struggling, known but to the few, with chilling poverty&#xD;
before him; now he was known and honored by many as&#xD;
the possessor of distinguished ability, with enough business&#xD;
to occupy his time and relieve him from all fear of want.&#xD;
Then a night, dark and tempestuous, was gathering ~over&#xD;
him; now a summer sea was before him, every gale was&#xD;
prosperous, and his bark sat lightly on the wave. His soci-&#xD;
ety was courted by the proudest of the men, and 'many were&#xD;
the beautiful women who lavished their smiles upon him.&#xD;
was intrinsically unchanged, and yet many, who had&#xD;
passed him by with indifference~'now discovered in him a&#xD;
thousand fascinations and qualities hitherto unobserved by&#xD;
them.. When the glare. of success is on a maii, it must be a&#xD;
duli~ eye which can 'not discover merit in him. The major-&#xD;
ity of our amiable race ~1ove to honor superior men, and it is&#xD;
pe~u1iarly unfortunate that they have not the means of de-&#xD;
teoting such until their praises are shouted by the multi-&#xD;
tude. There is only here and there a Columbus who has&#xD;
tis~ons~ of intellectual regions before they are mapped and&#xD;
nQt~3d down in every body's geography; and such a one is&#xD;
always sneered at 'by those wise heads whose faith is by far'&#xD;
too shrewd to Tattach itself to any thing so conjectural as&#xD;
genius beforee it has proved itself by efforts and successes&#xD;
which are so unequivocal as to leave no room for ~doubt.&#xD;
But this much-slandered world is a very good one, and Dray-&#xD;
-ton was so much pleased with its awards in his favor, that,&#xD;
in the overflowing thankfulness of his heart, he forgot to use&#xD;
the privilege; so uestirrz~ble to thousands, of cursing it.&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON.                    259;&#xD;
In his own success, he did not forget to rejoice at the 'suc-&#xD;
cess of the party ill politics to which~ he w~~s so warmly at-&#xD;
tached. The man who embodied, more than any of his co-&#xD;
temporaries, the feelings and the principles of Democracy,&#xD;
had been elevated to the most distinguished and honorable&#xD;
station among the. governments of this world. The Feder-&#xD;
alists, as a party, were ~prosti~*d; and Drayton rejoiced, for&#xD;
in their downfall he fancieI many obstacles to the success&#xD;
of our political experiments were removed; and he thought&#xD;
he saw in the signs starred all over the political firmament&#xD;
omens of his country's continued and permanent prosperity.&#xD;
Cheered by the reflection of what he had already achieved;&#xD;
burning with lofty resolves, and indulging in visions of daz-&#xD;
zling station in ths government, IDrayton held his onward.&#xD;
course courageously and dQtjfully. He was assured by a&#xD;
thousand evidences that he was already honored in the city&#xD;
amid whose multitudes he had embarked his fortunes, and&#xD;
that much had already been done toward the fulfillment of&#xD;
his resolution to rebuild his family~name on the spot which&#xD;
had witnessed its downfall. Still nirtch remained to be done,&#xD;
and any one who could have penetrated his designs and prop-&#xD;
erly estimated his ability would have predicted a prosperous&#xD;
and honorable career for him.&#xD;
Between Ellen Meredith and himself there had been more&#xD;
tenderness and intimacy since the death of her brother than&#xD;
before. That ~ieeply-deplored event had developed &amp;amp;mpa-&#xD;
thies between them, which caused them to feel~ closer to each&#xD;
other. Bereavements' always unite the afflicted, survivors&#xD;
more intimately, and hearts which have the same sources of&#xD;
sorrow naturally turn kindly to each other. On recurring&#xD;
to the attentions which they had mutually given to George&#xD;
during his? last hours, the regard which they had previously&#xD;
felt was deepened and strengthened. iDrayton's business&#xD;
pr'specta were so bright, that he felt himself warranted in&#xD;
pursuing the course he had long contemplated, and a year&#xD;
having expired since the death of George, he declared his&#xD;
love to Ellen, and was accepted.&#xD;
Their love was not of that wayward and uncherished kind&#xD;
which, conceived in an instaift, ja so often as'~~brief as it is&#xD;
brilliant. On the contrary, it had been tried in each stage,&#xD;
from the first budding of esteem to its perfection, when each&#xD;
one found in the society of the other the companionship which&#xD;
is ever unwearying, and counted over the long hours of ab-&#xD;
sence as time abstracted from their happiness. Love of this&#xD;

sort, if it has not the wild and startling brightness of the&#xD;
meteor, does not, like the meteor, soon fade away, but, rising&#xD;
like the ~star, retains its luster until it goes down in the&#xD;
shadows of the grave.&#xD;
Caroline Randolph's illness left her in a critical condition,&#xD;
from which she~, slowly recovered. Her physical health was&#xD;
gradually restored, but the shadow still reposed on her spirit.&#xD;
Her black and winning eye did not kindle with pleasure as&#xD;
in former years, and an expression of melancholy shaded the&#xD;
mouth once so brilliant with smiles, telling that she had sus-&#xD;
tained grief, ~and that its impression on her heart was in-&#xD;
~elible.&#xD;
The grave of the much-loved George Meredith was a hal-.&#xD;
lowed spot, whither often were directed the steps of those&#xD;
who had felt most keenly the loss occasioned by his removal&#xD;
to a brighter clime. Above his unhee4ing ear the birds&#xD;
sang in the summer morn, and the winds chanted a solemn&#xD;
requiem at eventide. The hand of affection had planted&#xD;
over the spot where lumbered the rose-bush which he&#xD;
loved and cherished w livingg, and as its flowers unfolded,&#xD;
and withered, and fell, they, in their sweet and short exist-&#xD;
ence, seemed a most befitting and eloquent decoration for the&#xD;
grave of one whose virtues had bloomed and passed away&#xD;
before the wintery period of existence came on.&#xD;
Thither Drayton frequently went to summon back the form&#xD;
of his vanished friend, and to muse on the many excellences&#xD;
which blended like rainbow hues in his character. After&#xD;
the strikes and excitements of the day are over, and the calm-&#xD;
ness and the contemplation of evening come on, it is mo~&#xD;
profitable to send our thoughts on pilgrimages to such a&#xD;
Mecca as the tomb of a very dear friend, and to feel the re-&#xD;
ligion of the hour and the place, while our winged petitions&#xD;
spring upward from the depths of the spirit, and soar away&#xD;
over the space which separates us from our destined homes&#xD;
in heaven.&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTON~           ~71&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XLV.&#xD;
THREE months had passed eiuce Drayton became the be-&#xD;
trothed of Eflen Meredith. Autumn was again on the earth,&#xD;
and the forests were beautiful in the variegated livery of the&#xD;
season. The riiigratory birds had sought ~a. southern home-&#xD;
flowers no longer exhaled their fragrance on the air-and as&#xD;
the morning winds went by, they seemed to whisper a dirge&#xD;
over the departed beauty of nature, and to tell of the near&#xD;
approach of wiiiter, with its frosts and chilling blasts. Only&#xD;
a very few days; were now interposed between Drayton and&#xD;
the hour which';he looked forward to as the most fortunate&#xD;
and most happy~ one of his life-the hour in which his for-&#xD;
tunes and those of Ellen were to commingle like kindred&#xD;
streams, and th~uceforth to flow o~Ahrough sun and shade,&#xD;
in harmony to the terminating oce~i.&#xD;
His uncle, although at times morose and crabbed in the&#xD;
extreme, was generally as affable toward him as, from his&#xD;
knowledge of his nature, he had any reason to expect. The&#xD;
truth is, the old gentleman's family pride was gratified by&#xD;
the knowledge that one in whose veins flowed blood kindred&#xD;
to his own, hadelevated himself, by his genius and good qual-&#xD;
ities, to ~n honorable station in society. Added to this, his&#xD;
nephew was about to be united to one who was an heiress,&#xD;
and on whose family escutcheon there was neither blot nor&#xD;
blemish. He tickled his own vanity by flattering himself&#xD;
that, had it not .been for the timely interposition of his own&#xD;
wisdom, his nephew would inevitably have fallen a victim to&#xD;
the weaknesses and follies which he regarded as incident to&#xD;
the blood of the Draytons. He was sitting in his, apartment&#xD;
one morning, musing over the fortunes of his nephew, and&#xD;
cursing the twinges in his afflicted foot by turns, when Dray-&#xD;
ton came in. The doctor's e~e sparkled with pleasure as he&#xD;
shook the hand of his nephew ~ud said,&#xD;
"I've just received a note' voting me out to Oakwood' on&#xD;
Tuesday evening 'next; but, curse this foot, I can't go."&#xD;
"I shall regret ~y~ur absence very much on that occasion,&#xD;
and I know Colonel Meredith will miss you when he looks&#xD;
round for someone of his own generation to crack ~. joke with&#xD;
while passing sentence on the quality of his wines.&#xD;

bRAY TON.&#xD;
"Ah! yes, I see clearly how it will be," said the doctor,&#xD;
glancing lic~iously, at h~is cushioned. foot. "While all my&#xD;
friends are full of merriment, I shall be here nursing this in-&#xD;
fernal disease, as solitary as lVLarius among the ruins of Car-&#xD;
thage. I was just thinking,~' he added, changing his subject&#xD;
and his tone, "I was just thinking, before you came in, on&#xD;
y&amp;amp;ur good luck~ It iW better to be born lucky than rich, for&#xD;
the lucky grow to be rich, and the rich, generally die poor.&#xD;
But you escape4~iri by a miracle."&#xD;
"I flatter my~4t4hat I made my own luck," said Drayton,&#xD;
with a smile, "ahd escaped ruin by my own resolves to the&#xD;
contrary."&#xD;
"That is only half true," returned the doctor. "You see,&#xD;
ifl your system there is a confluence of two streams of blood&#xD;
of diametrically antagonistic qualities. People always act&#xD;
conformably to their blood. If a man's blood is altogether&#xD;
vile, he is doomed, and an angel's arm can't snatch him from&#xD;
the brink of ruin on which he is always staggering. Why,&#xD;
sir, it is just as reasonable that a crab-apple tree should bear&#xD;
*    sweet fruit, as that a man with bad blood in his veins should&#xD;
do good to himself or to the community. You have two sorts&#xD;
of blood in your system, and the ascendency of that which&#xD;
comes from your father would have ruined you, had not the&#xD;
fortunate impulses of that which you derived from your&#xD;
ii~other, owing to auspicious circumstances, secured to you&#xD;
respectability and reputation. The Drayton..blood would&#xD;
have ruined you, if that of the Macdonalds had not rescued&#xD;
you.~,&#xD;
The ol&amp;amp;gentleman shook his head, as if his proposition was&#xD;
as clearly demonstrated as any in Euclid; while iDrayton&#xD;
*     smiled at his uncle's earnestness and self-congratulation.&#xD;
He had frequently listened to similar opinions from the orac-&#xD;
ular lips of his venerable relative before, and had latterly ab-&#xD;
stained from every thing like opposition to the thoughts to&#xD;
which his uncle was so wedded.~ The old gentleman con-&#xD;
tinued,&#xD;
"When you first came here, y~u seemed bent on being a&#xD;
Drayt9n, and, if I hadn't adyi~ed and cursed you, you. would&#xD;
have gone to the devil withoiTh a doubt. Bu~your better ge-&#xD;
nius prevailed, and you are now in the highway to wealth&#xD;
and renown. You balanced for a long time between the up-&#xD;
~ ward and downward tendencies of your nature, and escaped&#xD;
perdition by a miracle. Ah! you are~ lucky dog," added the&#xD;
doctor, laughing, and thrusting the head of his cane against&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAYTOI~.&#xD;
1ri~ nephew's side, "and Ellen is ~ charming girl. You will&#xD;
take possession of the Oakwood estate, and~thu~ eoi~p~te the&#xD;
admirable speculation which, you remember, I pQlILted out&#xD;
to you when I talked to you for the first time. Now, hark&#xD;
ye! boy, don't take the curb off of the Drayton blood, or it&#xD;
will run wild out at Oakwood, as it did in your grandfather's&#xD;
time, and ruin you yet. Thank Heaven for two things: first,&#xD;
that you had some Macdonald blood in your veins; and, sec-&#xD;
ondly, that you had an uncle, whose sag4~y pointed out to&#xD;
you in time the extreme jeopardy you wet0j~; in consequence&#xD;
ofhaving some bad hereditary forces in y6ur veins."&#xD;
Drayton thanked him for the advice which he had at sun-&#xD;
dry times given him, and left him in a better humor than he&#xD;
had ever observed him in.&#xD;
The anxiously-awaited period at length arrived. Vehicle&#xD;
after vehicle, from the city and the adjacent country, passed&#xD;
along the lane which led to Colonel Meredith's residence,&#xD;
where their expectant loads were discharged. The night&#xD;
was calm and beautiful. The moon li1~ up the scenery around&#xD;
Oakwood, and heaven seemed to smile auspiciously on the ap-&#xD;
proaching nuptials. The parlors were thronged with the old&#xD;
and young of both sexes, and the din of hundreds of voices&#xD;
rose on the sacred silence of the night.&#xD;
Drayton came forth with Ellen leaning on his arm, and&#xD;
all voices were hushed. A fairer couple is not often seen.&#xD;
There was an air of conscious pride on his features, while she,&#xD;
with her head slightly drooping, stood at his side in an atti-&#xD;
tude which seemed to foreshadow her future dependence on&#xD;
him whom she had chosen to be her protector through the&#xD;
vicissitudes of life.&#xD;
Unnoticed by any one, Mr. Fleetwood had stealthily ap-&#xD;
proached the door during the progress ofl the ceremony, and&#xD;
stood there with his eyes fixed on the youthful couple. As&#xD;
the minister pronounced them man and wife, he said, in a&#xD;
tone quite audible to every one present, "God bless you !"&#xD;
and retreated beyond the reach of observation.&#xD;
There was a general turning of heads toward the door from&#xD;
which the words proceeded, but the speaker had disappea~&#xD;
ed, and few suspected who it was that had uttered the ben'&#xD;
edition.&#xD;
Caroline Randolph was there, with her form shrouded in&#xD;
the sable hues of mourning. She retired wheu the ceremony&#xD;
was over, for her emotions were becoming insupportable. It&#xD;
was the first occasion, since the death of her lover, on which&#xD;

repaired to her room, where, unlike the light-hearted crowd&#xD;

The evening passed off pleasantly. The fitness of the par~&#xD;
ties who had been united for each other was a theme of&#xD;
general remark; and- even Mrs. Willoughby, forgetting her&#xD;
former antipathies, congratulated Drayton warmly on his suc-&#xD;
cess.&#xD;
We will here take leave of Drayton at this auspicious p~-&#xD;
nod of his life, when he could reflect oxt his past struggles&#xD;
with unembittered thoughts, and the future, no longer heavy&#xD;
and lowering with clouds, promisA him success in his pub.&#xD;
lie, and)~oppiness in his private career.&#xD;
