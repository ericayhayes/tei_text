CHAPTER I.&#xD;
"Shortmonths tothee, thou' alove me too;&#xD;
And after that, through life's long way,&#xD;
Become ;ny sure and cheering stay;&#xD;
Wi ar for me and be myhold',&#xD;
JOANNA BAUlE.&#xD;
THE light was faint and shadowy, as the&#xD;
shutters were closed for the purpose of&#xD;
excluding the glare of the sun. The re.-&#xD;
cent discovery for the alleviation of pain&#xD;
was then unknown, and the agony which&#xD;
every mother has willingly suffered since&#xD;
the persuasive vice of Eve tempted Adam&#xD;
to his undoing, had exhausted the powers&#xD;
of the female. She lay as quiet as the&#xD;
(lead, and nothing but a feeble pulse and&#xD;
a scarcely perceptible respiration indicated&#xD;
the continuance of vitality. The footsteps&#xD;
of her attendants fell softly upon the car-&#xD;
pet, and their conversation was low and&#xD;
whispering.&#xD;
" He is a brave boy, and I dare say will&#xD;
play his part in the world," said one of&#xD;
the matrons.&#xD;
"Doubtless, Mrs. Spencer, for his&#xD;
father will give him every advantage.&#xD;
He is a stout lad, too; I wonder what co-&#xD;
lour his eyes areI" and with a curiosity&#xD;
pardonable in a midwife she peered&#xD;
through her spectacles at the sleeping in-&#xD;
fant.&#xD;
" Don't forget to let it be extensively&#xD;
known, Mrs. Canfield, that the accouche-.&#xD;
ment-I believe that is the fashionable&#xD;
term-was entirely successful, and that,&#xD;
too, without the aid of a man-midwife,"&#xD;
and the female gave a scornful toss of the&#xD;
head, which had the effect of disarranging&#xD;
its well-adjusted gear.&#xD;
" That Iwon't, you may be sure," re-&#xD;
sponded Mrs. Canfield. "It is a burning&#xD;
shame that the legitimate business of our&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
sex should be appropriated by maudlin&#xD;
afnd fussy men. If they will usurp our du-&#xD;
,tes, why let them don our petticoats at&#xD;
on ce."&#xD;
" So say I, Mrs. Spencer, and I think&#xD;
those who are guilty of it should be seated&#xD;
at the loom and distaff of placed at the&#xD;
flat-iron and wash-tub.'&#xD;
."But are not our sex to blame for sub-&#xD;
mitting to it. In former times, you know,&#xD;
such a thing as the presence of a man was&#xD;
unknown, except, as I have read, when&#xD;
Queens were brought to bed, and then the&#xD;
nobility were stationed in the ante-room&#xD;
to prevent the prince from being exchanged.&#xD;
Yet they must have had strange feelings,"&#xD;
she continued, musingly, "if ;hey would&#xD;
swap their own flesh and blood."&#xD;
A pause ensued, and Mrs. Canfield ad-&#xD;
justed the covering upon the little stranger,&#xD;
while Mrs. Spencer took the waiter from&#xD;
the servant. It contained tea and d'eli-&#xD;
cious muffins, of which they partook with&#xD;
evident satisfaction. If anything, it had&#xD;
the effect of rendering them more Joqua-&#xD;
ciualthough the indignation which had&#xD;
been' aroused~ by men-midwives was not&#xD;
in the slightest degree abated.&#xD;
"I think, Mrs. Canfield, that an asso-&#xD;
ciation should be formed at once, for the&#xD;
purpose of restoring to our injue sex the&#xD;
rights which they once enjoyed. For a&#xD;
moment reflect upon the number of worthy&#xD;
females who are deprived of employment,&#xD;
(and consequently of that sustenance&#xD;
which, I regret to say, it is riot the custom&#xD;
of the times to extend gratuitously), by a&#xD;
set of prying, hush-a-hushy, effeminate&#xD;
doctors."&#xD;
" A good idea, Mrs. Spencer. By acting&#xD;
in concert we might effect a reformation -&#xD;
in public opinion. Without that union we&#xD;
can hope for nothing, and all our protes-&#xD;

stations will prove powerless against the&#xD;
nods, winks, and owl-like gravity of our&#xD;
professional and hereditary foes."&#xD;
"But can't we appeal to~their ma~na-&#xD;
nimity 'r'&#xD;
"Pooh! place            in the scale&#xD;
against        mafanimity&#xD;
money, an the former would&#xD;
k the beam. No; the medical&#xD;
fraternity are as much governed by the&#xD;
motto of 'every one for himself,~ as any&#xD;
portion of the human family which it has&#xD;
been my lot to encounter. Take another&#xD;
cup; it will do you good, and there is&#xD;
plenty of it."&#xD;
"It :s grateful ;~' and she inhaled its de-&#xD;
licious aroma. "But, as you were say-&#xD;
ing, it would doubtless be a waste of our&#xD;
energies to appeal to their generosity.&#xD;
Cannot we rely upon their delicacy?"&#xD;
"How can you ask such a question ~&#xD;
and she expressed her astonishment in&#xD;
ironical laughter. "I think you said deli-&#xD;
cacy! Why, they lose I? before they have&#xD;
concluded one course of lectures~ that is&#xD;
to say, those who ever witnessed the in-&#xD;
side of a lecture-room; and they can either&#xD;
lance an arm, or become an accoucheur,&#xD;
without a blush mantling their cheeks."&#xD;
"But will not remorse induce them to&#xD;
surrender the privileges which they have&#xD;
fraudulently obtained ?"&#xD;
"As much in the wrong as before. I&#xD;
tell you, their sensibilities are deadened,&#xD;
and they can amputate a cjuivering limb&#xD;
~vith as little hesitation as they could dis-&#xD;
sect a dead body.)~&#xD;
I thought as much~ then we should&#xD;
appeal to them in vain.'&#xD;
"Utterly so."&#xD;
~ Our only resource is an appeal to the&#xD;
female 5~~*~)&#xD;
"While we have just grounds for com-&#xD;
plaint against the medical fraternity," ob-&#xD;
served Mrs. Canfield, apologetically; "still&#xD;
we must frankly admit, that within their&#xD;
legitimate sphere, they are as useful as we&#xD;
are in ours. It is only when they transcend&#xD;
the bounds which nature has erected that&#xD;
there is an imperative necessity for re-&#xD;
forms?'&#xD;
"Spoken with your usual judgment," re-&#xD;
marked Mrs. Spencer, "and the reason&#xD;
why we demand a redress of our grievances&#xD;
should be distinctly set forth."&#xD;
"In the first place, it must be demon-&#xD;
strated that nature revolts at the presence&#xD;
of a man-midwife, and only yields to that&#xD;
stern and remorseless custom, ~vhich&#xD;
crushes by its inexorable decrees the&#xD;
shrinking modesty of youth."&#xD;
"But here lies the difficulty," Mrs. Can-&#xD;
field. "The ordeal is a fearful one, through&#xD;
&#xD;
STON.                                        C L I FTO0N.&#xD;
&#xD;
~vhich every mother must p ass, and the&#xD;
husband, as well as the wife, is ready to&#xD;
claim that professional skill which the me-&#xD;
dical fraternity have taken especial pains&#xD;
to make them believe they alone possess."&#xD;
"That is so; but it must be our duty to&#xD;
make the community discard this vulgar&#xD;
error, and vie~v the matter in its true aspect.&#xD;
That we can officiate with the same skill,&#xD;
and with far more tenderness, is undeniable,&#xD;
provided we have received the same in-&#xD;
struction as a man. Indeed, there are fe-&#xD;
males who have acquired the requisite&#xD;
amount of knowledge from experience&#xD;
alone. Let it once be known that we are&#xD;
as skilful as the other sex, and niy word&#xD;
for it, the services of a man ~vill never be&#xD;
called into requisition."&#xD;
"You have stated the point correctly,"&#xD;
observed Mrs. Spencer. "Ho~v do you&#xD;
propose to render them as skilful as the&#xD;
other sex&#xD;
"I would found a College, in which any&#xD;
respectable female might obtain admission&#xD;
for the purpose of acquiring a thorough&#xD;
education ; and not till then will our rights&#xD;
be guaranteed.~~&#xD;
Mrs. Canfield announced her programme&#xD;
with so much energy that the infant startled&#xD;
from its slumbers, uttered a cry, and open-&#xD;
ing its little eyes, stared into the a~lm~ring&#xD;
countenances of the two matrons as if he&#xD;
thought very strange beings inhabited his&#xD;
new world.&#xD;
"Give me my boy," said the young&#xD;
mother faintly, arid she pressed it lovingly&#xD;
in her arms; "lou may withdraw now, for&#xD;
a few minutes, ' she whispered,." Charles&#xD;
has returned."&#xD;
After reminding her of the danger of&#xD;
,over-exertion, they left the room. The&#xD;
door was immediately reopened, and a&#xD;
tall, finely-formed young man entered, and&#xD;
seating himself upon the bed1 pressed his&#xD;
lips upon the pale cheek of his wife.&#xD;
"You are a brave gjrl,~~ he said, fondly.&#xD;
"Do you think so ?" and her eloquent&#xD;
eyes were raised to his own.&#xD;
"Indeed 1 do. And we have such a&#xD;
noble little fellow too." He placed his&#xD;
finger as gently upon the cheek of the in-&#xD;
fant as.though it might mar its symmetry.&#xD;
"Do you still wish to call him Edward?"&#xD;
CC Certainly; unless you prefer some other&#xD;
name. His grandfather has always been&#xD;
so kind and affectionate."&#xD;
" As you will. His name, then, shall&#xD;
be Edward Clifton. In this breathing world&#xD;
which he has just entered, may talents and&#xD;
ambition force him above the common&#xD;
level, and from that elevated platform where&#xD;
the fe7 do congregate, may he aid good&#xD;
&#xD;
men to counteract the machinations of the&#xD;
bad, and give a proper direction to those&#xD;
events that make up the cycle of human&#xD;
existence."&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
"Thy nightly visits to my chamber made,&#xD;
That thou might'st know me safe and warmly laid,&#xD;
Thy morning bounties ere I left my home,&#xD;
The biscuit or confectionary plum,&#xD;
Tue fragrant waters on my cheeks bestowed&#xD;
Ily thine own hand, till fresh they shone and glowed;&#xD;
All this, and more endearing still than all,&#xD;
Thy constant flow of love, that knew no pall,&#xD;
Neer roughened by those cataracts and breaks&#xD;
That humour interposed too often makes."&#xD;
COPPER.&#xD;
LITTLE EDDY, as he termed himself, was&#xD;
seated upon his high chair at the breakfast&#xD;
table-an honour for which he was in-&#xD;
debted to his grandma. It was premature,&#xD;
as he was only two years old; and yet his&#xD;
innocent prattle seemed to amuse them,&#xD;
although there was very little sense in a&#xD;
conversation which, upon one side, con-&#xD;
sisted in the enunciation of nouns, con-&#xD;
nected here and there by verbs. His cousin,&#xD;
a charming little girl ten years of age, with&#xD;
large, laughing eyes, and long, curling&#xD;
ringlets, was seated by his side. Julia was&#xD;
a great favourite with him, because she&#xD;
engaged in his infantile amusement.&#xD;
Eddy gazed at her, and then at his&#xD;
mother, with much earnestness, as if he&#xD;
was endeavouring to ascertain why there&#xD;
was so milch difference between the ma-&#xD;
tured form of the latter~ and the slight pro-&#xD;
- portions of the former. Apparently, he&#xD;
could not solve the mystery, for he ejacu-&#xD;
lated,"Eddy eat brekta."&#xD;
"Eddy casts affectionate glances at&#xD;
Julia," said his mother. This, ~t least, he&#xD;
understood~ for suffering his eyes to fall, he&#xD;
said discontentedly, "Grandma&#xD;
when seated upon her knees, he bas full&#xD;
raised his eyes to his cousin's face, and&#xD;
murmured, "Oh, ~&#xD;
exhibited his stock of knowledge. "Grand-&#xD;
ma buy p ~&#xD;
dead,~~ "Janus d ~ Eddy shut eyes-&#xD;
rive horse." "Tom milk&#xD;
cows," C(white horse drink water,~~ ~C go&#xD;
way ose," "Eddy beat Grandma."&#xD;
After this burst of eloquence, his oratory&#xD;
abruptly terminated for want of language&#xD;
to express his ideas.&#xD;
"I think he displays a remarkably quick&#xD;
apprehension for a child so young,~) ob-&#xD;
served his mother.&#xD;
"Indeed I do," replied his grandma.&#xD;
&#xD;
19&#xD;
&#xD;
"He is a dear little fellow! How he re-&#xD;
members everything."&#xD;
"I doubt if his precocity is a favourable&#xD;
indication," said his father.&#xD;
"Why not, Charles?"&#xD;
"Because I have observed that an early&#xD;
development of the intellectual powers,&#xD;
like a premature birth, is almost invariably&#xD;
attended by injurious consequences. The&#xD;
mind wears itself out, by its own intensity,&#xD;
before the brain has acquired sufficient&#xD;
strength and co nsistency.~~&#xD;
"I hope not," replied Mrs. Clifton, de-&#xD;
spondingly, "for I have created for him a&#xD;
brilliant prospective, reaching far down the&#xD;
vista of time."&#xD;
"Perhaps I ought not to dim the present&#xD;
by apprehending that the future may not&#xD;
be more bright; still, we must not expect&#xD;
too much from the lad, or the disappoint-&#xD;
ment will be the more bitter."&#xD;
"It is at least a great consolation that&#xD;
he is so bright, instead of being stupid,'&#xD;
observed the grandmother.&#xD;
"I agree with you, entirely; but still, if&#xD;
present happiness is purchased by future&#xD;
disappointment, do we not pay for it too&#xD;
dearly ?"&#xD;
CC Chnrlcs, how can you apprehend any-&#xD;
thing so horrible ?"&#xD;
"For the reason which I suggested a&#xD;
moment since, and because the biography&#xD;
of illustrious men sustain it. Glance, for&#xD;
instance, at the boyhood of the four most&#xD;
remarkable men of the present day. Henry&#xD;
Clay was at first a mill-boy, of sufficient&#xD;
intelligence to deposit his bags safely with&#xD;
the miller. Subsequently, he performed&#xD;
the duties of a deputy -clerk very credita-&#xD;
bly. Thomas H. B enton was, for many&#xD;
years, regarded as an indifferent advocate~&#xD;
far from possessing an extraordinary&#xD;
amount of mental acumen. Daniel Web-&#xD;
ster, too idle for a farmer, dragged through&#xD;
four inglorious years at Dartmouth, only&#xD;
to teach school at Fireburg, register the&#xD;
deeds of the farmers of Maine, and hesi-&#xD;
tate between practising law and a $1500&#xD;
clerkship. John C. Calhoun was ignorant&#xD;
that he possessed any unusual amount of&#xD;
intellectual thought, until his metaphysical&#xD;
discussion with Professor Dwight, at Yale&#xD;
College. Perhaps, however, we appre-&#xD;
hend too much danger, as, after all, Ed-&#xD;
ward may not possess a particle more pre-&#xD;
cocity than other children of his age. It&#xD;
[is doubtless magnified by parental fond-&#xD;
ness, a consummation by no means re-&#xD;
markable."&#xD;
Notwithstanding the indulgence of his&#xD;
grandmother-for all grandmothers are&#xD;
supposed to spoil children, if they do not-&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
little Edward was a generous, brave, though&#xD;
rather self-willed boy. Daunted by no&#xD;
peril, he often narrowly escaped breaking&#xD;
his neck, or drowning himself. And~ the&#xD;
imminence of the danger, instead of ma-&#xD;
king him more cautious, only increased&#xD;
his recklessness. Fond of fun, without&#xD;
being cruel, he sought mirth, regardless of&#xD;
the consequences, provided it left no per-&#xD;
manent impression upbn the victim. And&#xD;
yet there were moments when he was sad&#xD;
and reflective. Seated beside a murmur-&#xD;
ing brook, heedless of the trout that nib-&#xD;
bled at his bait, or reclining against a tree,&#xD;
with his fowling-piece lying across his&#xD;
knees, he would pass hours in deep&#xD;
thought. It was during these intervals&#xD;
that plans for future action were matured,&#xD;
whi6h should gain for him those honours&#xD;
and distinctions that he had been induced&#xD;
to believe constitute the happiness of this&#xD;
earth.&#xD;
When he was four years old, his cousins&#xD;
Harry Dalton, called at his father's, for the&#xD;
purpose of inducing him to go in search&#xD;
of strawberries.&#xD;
Gliding around the house, to the spot&#xD;
where Edward was playing, Henry ex-&#xD;
pressed his wishes.&#xD;
"Well, I will go and ask mamma."&#xD;
"Oh, no, she will not let you go if you&#xD;
ask her."&#xD;
"I shall certainly not go without her&#xD;
consent," said the child, stoutly.&#xD;
"Mamma, I should like to go with&#xD;
Henry and get some strawberries for you."&#xD;
"I am afraid, my child, you will meet&#xD;
with some accident. Henry is so care-&#xD;
less."&#xD;
"No, mamma, I won't, for he can't&#xD;
make me do anything I dislike."&#xD;
"But you like to do so many things&#xD;
without persuading. But I will trust you&#xD;
this time, upon condition that you pass not&#xD;
into the woods beyond the mowing field."&#xD;
Arriving at the boundary which sepa-&#xD;
rated the hay lot from the forbidden terri-&#xD;
tory, they cast longing eyes into the deep&#xD;
shade, from which came forth the refresh-&#xD;
ing breeze that fanned their flushed cheeks.&#xD;
Looking backwards, to ascertain if their&#xD;
movements were observed, and finding&#xD;
that the vigilant eyes of Edward's mother&#xD;
were not upon them, they first mounted&#xD;
the fence, and, surprised to find that no&#xD;
personal injury resulted from this act of&#xD;
disobedience, Edward let himself down&#xD;
upon the other side. Gliding away through&#xD;
the grove, they seated themselves by a&#xD;
spring which burst from the hillside and&#xD;
trickled over the rocks into the valley be-&#xD;
neath. After having quenched their thirst,&#xD;
&#xD;
the y took off their shoes and stockings,&#xD;
and bathed their feet in the babbling&#xD;
stream. The rays of the sun pierced the&#xD;
thick foliage, and fell tremulously upon&#xD;
the earth, as the leaves quivered in the air.&#xD;
Little Edward's attention was arrested by&#xD;
one of those rays of light, and he won-&#xD;
dered how it was possihl~ for the sun to&#xD;
dance about so, because his mother had&#xD;
told hirii it was stationary. After ponder-&#xD;
ing a long time he advanced towards the&#xD;
spot, but the ray, falling upon his person,&#xD;
disappeared from the earth. Casting his&#xD;
eyes upwards, in search of it, a 'smile of&#xD;
satisfaction illuminated his face.&#xD;
"It is the leaves that move and not the&#xD;
sun, after all, so mamma was right.~~&#xD;
"What are you muttering about," said&#xD;
Henry, who was nearly asleep.&#xD;
"Oh, nothing about you."&#xD;
Having solved that problem, his thought&#xD;
turned upon the formation of the trees. It&#xD;
appeared, very strange to him that when&#xD;
the trunk was so firm, that the branches&#xD;
should be nodding and bowing to each&#xD;
other. He r~'conciled it, howe ver, by sup-&#xD;
posing that salutations were made by the&#xD;
branches as men aiid women incline their&#xD;
heads when they meet. He -now began&#xD;
to feel hungry, but Henry was sleeping so&#xD;
well that he disliked to disturb him, and&#xD;
he therefore looked around in search of&#xD;
some amusement. His satisfaction was&#xD;
great when he discovered in the edge of&#xD;
the pasture, a favourite colt, just half his&#xD;
own age, that had been ren(lered very tame&#xD;
by his caresses. Casting a look at his&#xD;
motionless companion, he glided away to-&#xD;
wardshis dumb favourite. The colt ex-&#xD;
pressed its satisfaction by rubbing his head&#xD;
agaLnst the little fellow. For a long time&#xD;
Edward had sincerely desired to mount&#xD;
"his horse "but his solicitations had been&#xD;
disregarded.&#xD;
"Now I'll have a ride," he solioquised.&#xD;
"But I've got no bridle. Never mind,&#xD;
Surwe (Surrey) won't kick. Let me put&#xD;
~ strawberries into my pocket."&#xD;
He led the gentle colt to a stump, and,&#xD;
after several ineffectual attempts, he suc-&#xD;
ceeded in ascending it. "Now, Surwe,&#xD;
be a good fellow; if you don't I won't&#xD;
never give you no more Oat5." Bounding&#xD;
in regular cavalier style, he was mounted.&#xD;
Surrey stood motionless at first, and then&#xD;
looking first upon one side and then upon&#xD;
the other, he frisked his long tail, and then&#xD;
walked forward a few yards. Alarmed at&#xD;
a burden to which he had never been ac-&#xD;
customed, the colt flourished his heels in&#xD;
the air, and then darted away at the top of&#xD;
his speed. The little horseman clung to&#xD;

20&#xD;
&#xD;
his mane with great courage and spirit&#xD;
At first he was alarmed, but as he ma-&#xD;
naged to retain his seat, the novelty of his&#xD;
position and the rapidity of the motion&#xD;
made the blood dance joyously through his&#xD;
veins. The current of air produced by the&#xD;
celerity of their motion carried his hat&#xD;
sailing far behind them, and his silken&#xD;
locks fluttered in the wind.&#xD;
The horse, now rendered almost frantic&#xD;
by fear, dashed along the slope of the hill,&#xD;
and skirting across the plain that intervened&#xD;
between the highland and the creek, made&#xD;
for the bridge which spantied it. The child&#xD;
was surrounded hy perils. Even if the colt&#xD;
retained his feet, there was imminent&#xD;
danger of his being swerved from his&#xD;
course, and instead of crossing the bridge,&#xD;
he might madly attempt to bound over the&#xD;
stream. Indeed, if he crossed the bridge,&#xD;
the hazard was equally great, because in&#xD;
that event they would enter a lane, across&#xD;
which swung a five-barred gate. With the&#xD;
velocity of a hurricane, the mettled courser&#xD;
swept across the plain, his head turned in&#xD;
the direction of the bridge, which he had&#xD;
nearly gained, when a large Newfourtdland&#xD;
dog darted suddenly from the shade of a&#xD;
tree at the flying steed. Thought is not&#xD;
quicXer than Surrey wheeled towards the&#xD;
creek. The sudden deviation caused the&#xD;
boy to lose his balance, and he would have&#xD;
been precipitated ~vith violence to the&#xD;
earth if his hand had grasped a bridle&#xD;
rein. Fortunately his fingers were twisted&#xD;
into the mane of the colt, and retaining his&#xD;
hold with desperate energy he dangled by&#xD;
its side. With a wild and angry snort&#xD;
Surrey darted for the bank of the creek&#xD;
which was ten feet above the water, and&#xD;
twice that distance from one side to the&#xD;
other. Bounding madly forward, the colt'&#xD;
was for a moment suspended in the air;&#xD;
but the distance was too great. His fore feet&#xD;
l~htd the top of the bank; his hind&#xD;
ige upon&#xD;
feet clung for an instant to the sides, when&#xD;
horse and rider rolled over into the deep&#xD;
and sluggish stream. Fortune again f~L&#xD;
voured the adventurous little horseman, for&#xD;
struggling~ in the creek they were separated.&#xD;
Scarcely'had Edward reached the water,&#xD;
when the noble dog plunged in, and seizing&#xD;
his master by the coat, kept his head above&#xD;
the stream until assistance arrived from the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
"Why did I let the child go ~" said the&#xD;
mother, wringing her hands frantically as&#xD;
she saw him mounted upon the flying&#xD;
horse. The alarm overpowered her ner-&#xD;
vous system, and she fainted. When she&#xD;
~vas restored to consciousness, Edw ardwas&#xD;
&#xD;
nding beside her, taking. strawberries&#xD;
rom his dripping spencer.&#xD;
"Here, dear mamma, don't look so pale!&#xD;
See! I have brought you berries, as I pro-&#xD;
mised. Here, take them, they are all yours,&#xD;

a bosom which beat with tumultuous joy&#xD;
for his delivery.&#xD;

One power, which, to no clime confined,&#xD;

"WHY do not p a and ma return V' in-&#xD;
quired Edward of the housekeeper, "they&#xD;
have been gone so long.~~&#xD;
"They will be at home in a few days&#xD;
now You must not become impatient."&#xD;
"Well, I don't think they will return be.&#xD;

"Hush, you must not talk so."&#xD;
"Well, won't God come down from the&#xD;
skies some day. The minister said so&#xD;
yesterday, but you didn't hear him, for you&#xD;
was asleep.~~&#xD;
"How can you say so."&#xD;
"Because your eyes were closed, and&#xD;
you nodded, an(l at last snored, until I&#xD;
pinched you."&#xD;
"You were a saucy little fellow to do&#xD;
so."&#xD;
"Then you must not make people stare&#xD;
at you. Mamma never lets me go to sleep,&#xD;
and the next time you do I shall stick this&#xD;
pin in you."&#xD;
"Come? you may go out and play now."&#xD;
And adjusting his hat, he sallied forth.&#xD;
Passing through the orchard, he met, upon&#xD;
the wayside, his little playmates, Harriet&#xD;
Salisbury, Charles Manley, and Kate Mer-&#xD;
ton, who were out for a day~s amusement&#xD;
in the raspberry field.&#xD;
"Come, Eddy, won't you go with us,"&#xD;
inquired Charles.&#xD;
"Ishould like to doso, but Susan will&#xD;
be alarmed about me."&#xD;
"See, I have a large basket full of nice&#xD;
cakes, with no one to help me eat them,"&#xD;
said Harriet.&#xD;
Still Edward declined to accompany&#xD;
them, until she continued half poutingl~',&#xD;

ran towards the house; and notwithstand-&#xD;
ing the protestations of the housekeeper,&#xD;
he soon joined his little companions.&#xD;
Crossing the road ,th ey entered a large&#xD;
pasture that was thickly covered with rasp-&#xD;
berry bushes. Here they wandered about&#xD;
until they became tired and hungry, and&#xD;
having filled their baskets with the deli-&#xD;
cious fruit, they seated themselves in a&#xD;
small grove upon the bank of the river.&#xD;
The little girls exhibited their store upon&#xD;
the grass, and invited their companions to&#xD;
partake of the food.&#xD;
After finishii~giheir meal, they descended&#xD;
to the water's edge, and seating themselves&#xD;
upon the rocky shore, they bathed their&#xD;
hands in the grateful element.&#xD;
"Let's batTie our ~ s~iid Edward&#xD;
"we shall not take cold.N'&#xD;
"What, before you i~' exclaimed Kate,&#xD;
a little maiden six years old.&#xD;
"And why not r'. said Charles: "are&#xD;
you not my little wife, and didn't I hear&#xD;
Harriet promise to be Eddy's a few&#xD;
minutes ago, when they thought I was&#xD;
not near them. And did you not walk&#xD;
about without any shoes last summery"&#xD;
"But we are larger girls now. But if&#xD;
you want us so much,&#xD;
The young gallants dexterously unlaced&#xD;
the boots from their tiny feet.&#xD;
"Why, Harriet, how much longer your&#xD;
garter is than Kate's," said Edward, mea-&#xD;
suring them. Pondering upon the dis-&#xD;
parity, he suffered the longest one to fall&#xD;
from his hand into the ~vater, when it was&#xD;
borne by the rapid current swiftly down&#xD;
the stream.&#xD;
Without hesitating a moment, and be-&#xD;
fore his design could be frustrated, Ed-&#xD;
ward plunged into the water and attempt-&#xD;
ed to regain the lost treasure. The water&#xD;
near the bank was shallow, scarcely reach-&#xD;
mo above his knees, and he dashed ra-&#xD;
pi~ly forward. Already had he approached&#xD;
the prize, when his foot slipped upon the&#xD;
rocks, and he was immersed in the water.&#xD;
Rising immediately, and heedless of the&#xD;
frantic cries to come back, he dashed on-&#xD;
wards. The channel became deeper, and&#xD;
conscious that it would soon sink beyond&#xD;
his depth he made a desperate plunge,&#xD;
and seized the object of his pursuit. But&#xD;
his feet could no longer reach the bottom,&#xD;
and his horror-stricken companions saw&#xD;
him disappear from their sight. When he&#xD;
rose to the surface he was far down the&#xD;
stream, hurried impetuously forward by&#xD;
&#xD;
the irresistible flood. "He will be drown-&#xD;
ed! he will be drowned !'' wildly ex-&#xD;
claimed Harriet, and the cheeks of all&#xD;
three were blanched with terror. He&#xD;
floated for a moment, and then again sunk&#xD;
from their view. At that instant, they saw&#xD;
through the trees the form of a man part-&#xD;
ing the bosom of the river with rapid and&#xD;
powerful strokes. Running along the&#xD;
bank, they clustered together at a point&#xD;
where they could witness his movements.&#xD;
He had reached the middle of the river,&#xD;
and was gazing anxiously around the spot&#xD;
where the child had vanished in the foam-&#xD;
ing stream. I~ut he began to despair of&#xD;
ever beholding him again, when his dark&#xD;
hair emerged from the water several yards&#xD;
below. Dashing forward with incredible&#xD;
I velocity, he seized the helpless 'boy as he&#xD;
was sinking for the last time, and bearing&#xD;
his unconscious burden to the shore, he&#xD;
laid him upon the ground. In his hand&#xD;
was still clasped an ehistic white satin&#xD;
garter.&#xD;
"He is dead, I am sure he is dead !"&#xD;
extilaimed Harriet, as she threw her white&#xD;
arms around his neck and kiss&#xD;
pie lips.                 ed his pur-&#xD;
"I hope not," said Major Stroney;&#xD;
"your caresses are already restoring him&#xD;
to consciousness; though a few minutes&#xD;
more would have finished him."&#xD;
"I am so glad! dear Eddy," and she&#xD;
wiped the water from his face and hair&#xD;
with her white frock, "you will Jive, won't&#xD;
you ~ If you do, I will give you the garter."&#xD;
A pleased smile came over the face of&#xD;
'the boyas he gallantly pressed the satin&#xD;
to his lips.&#xD;
"Egad, if she was developed, I would&#xD;
think it cheaply woh~ my chivalric young&#xD;
friend."&#xD;
Several weeks had elapsed after the&#xD;
events transpired which we have just re-&#xD;
lated, when Edward went to pass the day&#xD;
with Charles Manley. Having exhausted&#xD;
all the sources of amusement they com-&#xD;
menced" conjuring" up something new.&#xD;
A vicious horse had for a long time in-&#xD;
fested the n~iighbourhood. There w~ no&#xD;
low spot in the fences that he had not&#xD;
managed to fln~ out, and every tempting&#xD;
field had been visited. Charles was par-&#xD;
ticularly e~ged, because the brute had&#xD;
utterly d royed a melon-patch upon a re-&#xD;
cent ~fffmay. In every other respect the&#xD;
hors was ill- atur~ed; he would not work&#xD;
in ha ss an only upon certain occa-&#xD;
sions was it safe to mount his back. It&#xD;
would be difficult to conceive a more un-&#xD;
popular beast than brown Oscar.&#xD;

"Let's tie a basket to his tail," proposed himself. With your permission he shall&#xD;

They now labored to attach the basket "I shall try and induce Col. Florence&#xD;

disappeared over the hill, with the basket and new straw hat.&#xD;
still flying at his tail.              "Where are you going, Harriet ~"&#xD;

of the dwelling were soon in motion, lights&#xD;
pierced the ~loom of night, and ~Edward's&#xD;
trunk was seized by the driver and strapped&#xD;
upon the stage.&#xD;
For a moment the little fellow was&#xD;
clasped to his mother's bosom, and their&#xD;
tears mingled together. "There, now&#xD;

"Good bye, dear ~ and he&#xD;

"Good bye, Edward."&#xD;
"Good bye, de~r papa.7~&#xD;
The ~loor was closed, the driver cracked&#xD;
his whip, and the mettled horses dashed&#xD;
away ,and in a moment nothing was heard&#xD;
but the rocking of the coach, and the tramp-&#xD;
ling of feet as the sounds floated indistinctly&#xD;
upon the night air.&#xD;
For a long time Edward wept bitterly.&#xD;
It was his first separation from his parents,&#xD;
and they had alway~ treated ~him so ten-&#xD;
derly that his heart was almost broken at&#xD;
being thqs placed in a stage among stran-&#xD;
gers, and in total darkness to be borne&#xD;
from those he loved so dearly. Gradually,&#xD;
however, he dried up his tears, and no&#xD;
sound proclaimed his sadness, except a&#xD;
sob that would occasionally burst from his&#xD;
overcharged bosom.&#xD;
Several hours elapsed before daylight&#xD;
began to steal athwart the sky. Gazing&#xD;
from the window, he watched the progress&#xD;
of light as it spread over the earth, bring-&#xD;
ing distinctly into view the highlands, and&#xD;
casting a mellow shade across the glens.&#xD;
At last the sun shed its rays upon the scene,&#xD;
brighteningthe tints ofthe autumnal leaves,&#xD;
and peering into secluded dells, or prying&#xD;
into the secrets of each hidden recess.&#xD;
Here and there the saucy red-squirrel&#xD;
leaped from one tree to another; the wood-&#xD;
pecker uttered his shrill cry, and the whirr&#xD;
of the partridge was heard in the distance.&#xD;
Turning his glance on his fellow-pas-&#xD;
sengers, he saw, upon the middle seat with&#xD;
himself; two countrymen. On the first&#xD;
seat were a little girl, an elderly lady, and&#xD;
a gentleman, while behind him were two&#xD;
&#xD;
enormous old men. At the moment his&#xD;
attention was attracted towards them, they&#xD;
were sleeping, as well as they could in sue h&#xD;
awkward positions. They all kept bowing&#xD;
their heads as if each was resolved not to&#xD;
be outdone in politeness by the others.&#xD;
Edward wondered if the countryman's hat&#xD;
would fall off and if so he calculated the&#xD;
probabilities of its coming in contact with&#xD;
the elderly lady's bonnet. If it tumbled&#xD;
off when her head inclined forward, then&#xD;
the collision would take place. Each time&#xD;
the head of the countryman sunk upon his&#xD;
bosom, it was raised with a jerk, and his&#xD;
hat inclined still farther forward. The ca-&#xD;
tastrophe could not be much longer de-&#xD;
layed, and Edward now anxiously waited&#xD;
to see, if in its descent, the hat was to&#xD;
crush the bonnet. For a moment the nods&#xD;
of the man became more rapid than those&#xD;
of the lady; but now their heads inclined&#xD;
together, when down came the large bell-&#xD;
crowned hat upon' the frail covering of the&#xD;
lady~s head.&#xD;
"Ha! ha! ha ~ roared Edward, unable&#xD;
t&amp;amp;control his laughter. It was increased&#xD;
by the disconcerted looks of the country-&#xD;
man, and the spiteful glances of the matron,&#xD;
and when the little girl joined in the mer-&#xD;
riment, his sides shook until the tears&#xD;
coursed each other down his cheeks. The&#xD;
passengers, aroused from their slumberfi,&#xD;
began to converse.&#xD;
"Have we crossed the river yet V' in-&#xD;
quired 9ne of the fat men.&#xD;
"No~ we are just approaching ~ re-&#xD;
sponded the countryman, casting a furtive&#xD;
glance at the elderly lady, as if he would&#xD;
distract her attention from the bonnet,&#xD;
which seemed to claim her undivided at-&#xD;
tention.&#xD;
"We cannot be far from the stand where&#xD;
we take breakfast !"&#xD;
"About six miles."&#xD;
"So fart I am hungry, ain't you, neigh-&#xD;
bour ~"&#xD;
"Very, we have had a long ride since&#xD;
supper, and plenty of jolting."&#xD;
The stage had reached an eminence&#xD;
that commanded an extensive view of the&#xD;
adjacent country. A range of mountains&#xD;
bounded the horizon upon their left. It&#xD;
was covered by a dense growth of forest&#xD;
trees, and the variegated foliage of the&#xD;
maple and beech mingled with the eter-&#xD;
nal green of the hemlock and the pine.&#xD;
Along the ~se Qf the mQuntain wound&#xD;
the river,. dilnEnishing in the distance until&#xD;
its broad bosom was contracted into a&#xD;
silver thread. Thjs glorious prospect was&#xD;
lit up by the bright rays of the morning&#xD;

maiden, turning her large blue eyes upon&#xD;
Edward. (Tl~ieir mingled laughter was an&#xD;
introduction.)&#xD;
~' I am glad you think.so," he replied,&#xD;
"for I have been admiring it this half hour."&#xD;
The coachman took up his key bugle,&#xD;
and while the panting horses obtained a&#xD;
few moments' rest, he awaKened the moun-&#xD;
tain echoes with his wild melody.&#xD;
The stage rapidly descended the hill,&#xD;
and in half an hour the coachman drew&#xD;
the reins in front of a country inn. Edward&#xD;
assisted his little fellow-passenger to alight,&#xD;
and was rewarded for his gallantry by&#xD;
having assigned him a seat next hers at&#xD;
the breakfast-table.&#xD;
"I am going to Andover to attend the&#xD;
female Institution," whispered the lass.&#xD;
"Where are you goingV'&#xD;
"I am bound for the male school at the&#xD;
same place. Who are your companions 'P&#xD;
"Papa and my aunt. They go to see&#xD;
no harm comes to me."&#xD;
"When do they return ~"&#xD;
"And where do you board ?"&#xD;
"Perhaps in the Institution; maybe&#xD;
somewhere else."&#xD;
"I am glad you attend school at An-&#xD;
~ continued the lad, after a pause;&#xD;
"there will be some one there now with&#xD;
whom I am acquainted.~&#xD;
"But if I board at the Institution they&#xD;
will not let you spc:k to me."&#xD;
"Then, if I ~ in your place, I would&#xD;
not go there."&#xD;
"Oh! I must go wherever papa sends&#xD;
me-but there is the stage. Here, tie on&#xD;
my hat while I put on my gloves. You&#xD;
can see, can't you, without coming so close.,&#xD;
Thank you. Come, they are all waiting&#xD;
for us. My name is Fanny Brenton; what&#xD;
is yours 'P&#xD;
"Edward Clifton."&#xD;
At noon the passengers alighted at the&#xD;
village of Andover, and after dining at the&#xD;
hotel, Edward's baggage was removed to&#xD;
the residence of Col. Florence, whither he&#xD;
soon followed.&#xD;

"The first caress of beauty, 0, that giowi&#xD;

A hope, a wish, a feeling yet unfelt,&#xD;
That mould in madness, or in mildness melt."&#xD;
CLASON.&#xD;
THE next day Edward entered the Aca-&#xD;
demy, and his desk was assigned him.&#xD;
His application became intense and in a&#xD;
few weeks he was at the head of his class.&#xD;
Courteous and polite to all, he soon was a&#xD;
favourite with nearly all the school. In the&#xD;
family of Col. Florence he soon felt per-&#xD;
fectly at home. Mrs. Florence w~s, in&#xD;
childhood, the playmate of Mr. ~ifton,&#xD;
and she manifested a mother's regard for&#xD;
his son. With Mary Florence, and her&#xD;
brother Frank, who were both about his&#xD;
own age, he soon became intimate, and&#xD;
the hours passed together in the social cir-&#xD;
cle were rendered, pleasant by music and&#xD;
conversation.&#xD;
There was one boy, whose name was&#xD;
Charles Stanton, attending the school, who&#xD;
managed to render himself excessively&#xD;
odious, by his violent~temper and insuffer-&#xD;
able disposition. . His strength made him&#xD;
a formidable antagonist, and all his com-&#xD;
panions dreaded an encounter with "him.&#xD;
From the first, Edward anticipated a colli-&#xD;
sion, having witnessed a sneering expres-&#xD;
sion upon his countenance, the morning&#xD;
he entered the Academy. Resolved to&#xD;
delay the quarrel as long as possible, he&#xD;
managed for several weeks to evade an&#xD;
introduction.&#xD;
An arrangement was made between&#xD;
the principa'i~s of the male and female&#xD;
school, for an excursion to the falls in the&#xD;
river, about three-fourths of a mile from&#xD;
the village. At twelve o'clock, they had&#xD;
congregated upon the bank of the stream,&#xD;
where the river plunged into the chasm.&#xD;
Edward saw Fanny Brenton among the&#xD;
and advancing to her side expressed&#xD;
his satisfaction at the meeting. Holding&#xD;
out her band frankly, she returned his&#xD;
pressure.&#xD;
"I am very glad to see you," she said.&#xD;
"Why you have made no attempt to as-&#xD;
certain whether I was living or dead."&#xD;
"You are too hard. I found you were&#xD;
boarding at the Institution, and supposed it&#xD;
was impossible to see you."&#xD;
"In this world, you should never sup-&#xD;
pose the accomplishment of any object&#xD;
impossible, until you have made the at-&#xD;
tempt."&#xD;
"A good motto, by Jove, and one that I&#xD;
will treasure in my memory for all time."&#xD;
"It will never do either of ~ou any&#xD;
good," muttered young Stanton as he pass'.&#xD;
ed. Fanny looked surprised, while Ed-&#xD;

&#xD;
ward, hounding forward, placed himself&#xD;
beside the scoffer, and with bent brow&#xD;
and flashing eye, he said, "I heard you&#xD;
indistinctly1 sir, but I gathered from your&#xD;
language that you wished to insult a lady&#xD;
as well as myself."&#xD;
"One ~who is even duller in comprehen-&#xD;
sion than you, might easily have come to&#xD;
that ~&#xD;
~C At your earliest convenience," replied&#xD;
our hero, his frame trembling with pas-&#xD;
sion; "when we are not in the presence&#xD;
of the ladies, you will hold yourself ac-&#xD;
countable to me for this language.)~&#xD;
"Oh, at any moment, young gentle-&#xD;
man," responded the other, ~vith perfect&#xD;
coolness.&#xD;
"I hope you will not have a difficulty&#xD;
with that person on my account, Edward."&#xD;
"Excuse me, Fanny, hut do not let any&#xD;
reference to him mar our amusement,&#xD;
when we meet so rarely. Can I not see&#xD;
you oftener.".&#xD;
"I do not see how it is possible, the re-&#xD;
gulations of the Institution are so strict. I&#xD;
shall beg papa to let meboard at a private&#xD;
house next session, and then you may&#xD;
carry my books sometimes, perhaps."&#xD;
Afteradelightfuldaythe party returned to&#xD;
the village, where they arrived before night.&#xD;
Edward proceeded at once to a store, pur-&#xD;
chased a cowhide, and arming himself&#xD;
with a leaden-headed staff, sought the play-&#xD;
grounds attached to the Academy. Here&#xD;
he discovered Stanton, who was disputing&#xD;
in a loud and imperious voice, with one of&#xD;
his companions. "Well then," said the&#xD;
latter, "I will leave it to any of the boys&#xD;
to decide which of us is right."&#xD;
"Very well, who will you select ~" re-&#xD;
plied Stanton haughtily.&#xD;
"Any one. Here is Clifton, let him be&#xD;
the arbiter."&#xD;
"Never! Neither a knave nor a block-&#xD;
head shall have aught to do in my affairs."&#xD;
"Fie, for shame, Stanton !" exclaimed a&#xD;
dozen voices, and then profound silence&#xD;
reigned upon the green. The smaller lads&#xD;
grew pale and the larger ones held their&#xD;
breath. For a moment Clifton gazed upon&#xD;
his antagonist with the most intense scorn,&#xD;
and then walking deliberately forward, he&#xD;
struck him violently across the face with&#xD;
the cowhide. For a moment, blinded by&#xD;
passion and smarting under the effects of&#xD;
the blow, Stanton raved like a maniac, but&#xD;
recovering his self-possession, he un-&#xD;
sheathed a knife, and, with a savage yell&#xD;
darted towards his assailant. As he raised&#xD;
his arm to inflict a fatal stab, Edward's&#xD;
staff descended upon his wrist with such&#xD;
force, that his weapon was dashed from&#xD;
&#xD;
his han ~~ore Stanton could recover&#xD;
it, Clifton, in his headlong passion, hurled&#xD;
his cane with such force,~h at, coming in&#xD;
contact with the head of his foe, it pros-&#xD;
trated him senseless upon the earth.&#xD;
"Three cheers for t1~ conqueror of the&#xD;
bully !" shouted ahoy; and they were given&#xD;
with the wildest enthusiasm. Scarcely&#xD;
had the last huzza died away, when two&#xD;
of the teachers burst into the circle, and&#xD;
conveying the still insensible Stanton into&#xD;
the Academy, endeavored to restore him&#xD;
to consciousness. For a long time their&#xD;
efforts were unavailing. He had received&#xD;
a severe contusion upon the temple, and&#xD;
his wrist was nearly dislocated. A physi-&#xD;
cian was summoned, and after being bled&#xD;
copiously, he was aroused from the stupor,&#xD;
and conveyed to his lodgings.&#xD;
Edward could hardly escape from his&#xD;
enthusiastic friends after the encounter.&#xD;
They rejoiced at his victory, because they&#xD;
admired him as much as they detested&#xD;
Stanton.&#xD;
"But how came you armed."&#xD;
~" Once before to-day he had grossly in-&#xD;
sulted not only me, but a young lady, who&#xD;
for the moment was under my protection,&#xD;
and I determined to chastise him for it."&#xD;
"Right, you were perfectly right; so say&#xD;
we all."&#xD;
"I am obliged to you for your approval.&#xD;
I hope for the future he will be more&#xD;
gentlemanly in his hearing. Good bye,&#xD;
boys.~~&#xD;
"Good icye, Clifton."&#xD;
Several weeks elapsed before Stanton&#xD;
was able to leave his room, and when he&#xD;
had sufficiently recovered, he abandoned&#xD;
the Institution and returned home.&#xD;
From the moment of his conflict with&#xD;
Stanton, Edward became the idol of the&#xD;
school. No one apprehended that a want&#xD;
of physical prowess would subject him to&#xD;
personal wrong, for he had a protector in&#xD;
Edward Clifton. As just as he was brave,&#xD;
he was often appealed to by young men&#xD;
even, to decide their controversies, and&#xD;
his judgment was conclusive.&#xD;
Thus opened his career, brilliant as it&#xD;
was commendable.&#xD;
It is a great mistake to suppose that for&#xD;
manhood is reserved the struggle for dis-&#xD;
tinction, or the thirst for applause. In&#xD;
youth, the brain is tortured for the purpose&#xD;
of winning that approbation which sends&#xD;
the warm blood gushing from the heart.&#xD;
What skilful diplomacy is practiced for&#xD;
the purpose of elevating the ambitious&#xD;
boy above his fellows ~ A man does not&#xD;
possess, at once, those powers which are&#xD;
destined to exercise authority over the&#xD;

&#xD;
human race. They are illustrated, in a&#xD;
more modified form, it is true, in the&#xD;
career of the student: As much tact is&#xD;
sometimes displayed, by a lad in destroy-&#xD;
ing a combination among his class-mates,&#xD;
as there is by the most consummate diplo-&#xD;
mat in dissolving a coalition.&#xD;

HALLER.&#xD;
"I see the anchored bark, with streamers gay,&#xD;
The beckoning pilot, and the ruffled tide."&#xD;
TAsso.&#xD;
IT was the month of June; in the North.&#xD;
em States the most delightful season of the&#xD;
year. There were two w~eks vacation in&#xD;
the male and female Institutions of Ando-&#xD;
ver, and the students were preparing to&#xD;
carry oftt the plans which they had formed&#xD;
for that brief period. Three years had&#xD;
elapsed since Edward commenced attend-&#xD;
ing the school at Andover, and he was&#xD;
soon to enter college. He was now a&#xD;
large, fine-looking young man of sixteen,&#xD;
whose polished address, and frank man-&#xD;
ners made him a general favourite.&#xD;
Clifton had formed a party of eight per-.&#xD;
sons, four young gentlemen and an equal&#xD;
number of maidens, for the purpose of&#xD;
visiting a celebrated mountain~ about twen-&#xD;
ty miles distant from Andover. An elderly&#xD;
lady, one of the matrons of the female&#xD;
Institution, whose austerity of manner ren-&#xD;
dered her an admirable chaperon, accom-&#xD;
panied the party. A capacious oil-cloth&#xD;
tent, mattresses and be&amp;amp;clothes for the&#xD;
ladies, and a sufficient amount of cooking&#xD;
utensils were packed up, while rifles and&#xD;
fishing-tackle were not forgotten. The&#xD;
services of an experienced cook, a waiter&#xD;
and a maid were secured, and having&#xD;
chartered a large coach, they started, one&#xD;
bright morning early in June, for Mount&#xD;
Vista.&#xD;
The dew still glistened upon the grass,&#xD;
as four spirited horses~ dashed along the&#xD;
road, now mounting hills, and anon de!&#xD;
sending with rapid steps through valleys,&#xD;
and along the water-courses.&#xD;
Harriet Salisbury sat beside Clifton upon&#xD;
the front seat, Fanny Brenton occupied&#xD;
the middle seat, facing our hero, and be-&#xD;
tween her and Charlotte Dennison was&#xD;
Frederic Maitland, upon the left of Har-&#xD;
riet Salisbury was George French, while&#xD;
&#xD;
27&#xD;
&#xD;
the hack seat was occupied by Dame&#xD;
Batchelor, Mary Holmes, and Duncan&#xD;
Kelborn. The attendants rode upon the out-&#xD;
side with the driver. The coach was one&#xD;
of those easy, rocking establishments, for&#xD;
which New England is celebrated.&#xD;
It would be difficult to select four more&#xD;
beautiful and charming girls, than were&#xD;
assembled together in ~that stage, or four&#xD;
gallants whose wit and originality could&#xD;
he surpassed. As the two front seats&#xD;
faced each other, Edward en&#xD;
versation of Harriet and Fanny Brenton.&#xD;
These young ladies had passed through&#xD;
a wonderful transition since we first pre-&#xD;
sented them to the reader. The form of&#xD;
Miss Brenton was now tall and graceful,&#xD;
her complexion brilliant the contour of&#xD;
her neck swanlike, and her eyes, a hea-&#xD;
venly blue. Harnet was a brunette, her&#xD;
round figure inclined to embonpoint, and&#xD;
the large black eyes could flash with&#xD;
fire or melt with tenderness. Mary Holmes&#xD;
had soft hazel eyes, and a large mass of&#xD;
auburn hair. The outlines of her form&#xD;
were full and flowing, and her colour went&#xD;
and came with the ever-varying emotions.&#xD;
Carlie Dennison was scarcely above the&#xD;
medium height, her eyes were black and&#xD;
piercing, her luxuriant hair the colour of&#xD;
the raven's wing, and the rich blood each&#xD;
moment threatened to gush forth from her&#xD;
clear, transparent cheek. They were all&#xD;
sixteen years of age, and each one could&#xD;
claim those indispensable prerequisites&#xD;
to entitle the possessor to the appellation&#xD;
of lovely-beautiful eyes, melodious voice.&#xD;
pearly teeth, taper fingers, and Norman&#xD;
feet.&#xD;
Ten miles of the distance was accom-&#xD;
plished before eight o'clock, and five more&#xD;
would bring them to the head of the lake,&#xD;
upon the shores of whi~sh Mount Vista&#xD;
reared its lofty head. ~&#xD;
"Shall we breakfast at this stand,&#xD;
ladiesW inquired Edward, as the horses&#xD;
were approaching the tavern, "or shall&#xD;
we continue to the Lake House V'&#xD;
"Oh to the lake, by all means," ex-&#xD;
claimed Fanny and Carlie. "What is your&#xD;
opinion, Mistress Batchelor Y'&#xD;
"I do not think it will be too long a ride&#xD;
for the ladies."&#xD;
"Let us see the lake as soon as possible,"&#xD;
said Mary.&#xD;
"To the Lake House, then, driver."&#xD;
There was now a long, though not ab-&#xD;
rupt ascent for two miles, a long a range&#xD;
of hills covered with evergreen trees.&#xD;
As they were slowly ascending it, a bevy&#xD;
of pheasants ran across the road.&#xD;
"Stop, coachman, a moment," and&#xD;

Edward and Maitland leaped from the&#xD;
stage with their rifles. Descending th&amp;amp;&#xD;
bank a few steps, they fired simultane-&#xD;
ously into the forest, a flutter followed the&#xD;
echo of their pieces, and they soon return-&#xD;
ed with two birds.&#xD;
"They are fat, although slightly out of&#xD;
season; go on, no~v, driver !"&#xD;
As soon as they had reached the top of'&#xD;
the hill they all alighted for the purpose&#xD;
of viewing the prospect.&#xD;
"Is it not beautiful !" "Did you ever&#xD;
behold anything so charming," they ex-&#xD;
claimed enthusiastically. It was indeed a&#xD;
glorious spectacle. Some three miles dis-&#xD;
tant, and far beneath them was Lake&#xD;
a sheet of water thirty miles long, and&#xD;
varying from one to five miles wide~ it&#xD;
wa~ interspersed with beautiful islands,&#xD;
that thickly studded its bosom. Upon one&#xD;
shore could be seen country-seats and&#xD;
highly-cultivated farms, while upon the&#xD;
other, a range of hills extended along the&#xD;
shore of the lake, rising in the distance to&#xD;
the grandeur of mountains. No breeze&#xD;
ruffled the glassy surface of the lake, and&#xD;
it presented the appearance of a vast mir-&#xD;
ror, reflecting the sloping banks of one&#xD;
side, and the rough and lofty shores of the&#xD;
other. At their feet reposed the small&#xD;
village of Groton, with its hotel, store, and&#xD;
meeting-house.&#xD;
"Do you see the highest peak in the&#xD;
distance, jist whar the lake seems to stop ~"&#xD;
inquired the coachman; "well, that ere is&#xD;
Mount Vista !"&#xD;
"Indeed," said Harriet, "how do we&#xD;
get there !"&#xD;
"Oh easily enough," responded Clifton.&#xD;
"W~ sail to its base in a barge, and then&#xD;
trust to our good limbs to place us upon its&#xD;
summit."&#xD;
"An easy task, ~ observ-&#xD;
ed Fanny; 'one could almost step from the&#xD;
lake to its utmost elevation."&#xD;
"You would have to exchange those&#xD;
tiny gaiters for a pair of seven.mile boots,&#xD;
then," said George French, glancing at&#xD;
the small feet which were exposed by a&#xD;
short dress.&#xD;
"Is it so far~"&#xD;
"About three miles0!"         0&#xD;
"Who would have thought itt"&#xD;
They were soon glidingdown the declivity&#xD;
with a velocity that caused a suppressed&#xD;
scream to escape from Mary Holmes, and&#xD;
Mistress Batchelor to inquire if there really&#xD;
was no danger. The horses drew up at&#xD;
the hotel, and the merry party descended&#xD;
and were soon congregated in the grove&#xD;
upon the lake shore. Ere long they were&#xD;
summoned to the breakfast-table, and de-&#xD;
&#xD;
CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
s ite the enthusiasm of the moment, they&#xD;
I made a hearty meal.&#xD;
rations were now made for their&#xD;
departure. The cook purchased an abun-&#xD;
dant supply of luxuries, as well as neces-&#xD;
saries, and they were stored, together with&#xD;
the bagcracre in the boat. The wind now&#xD;
blew~'off s'~mcre, and gave token of a plea-&#xD;
sant sail, and at 10 o'clock the barge was&#xD;
unmoored, and the receding~ party were&#xD;
saluted by waving handkerc~iiefs from the&#xD;
shore.&#xD;
"I am so delighted !" exclaimed Fanny&#xD;
Brenton, as, suffering her hand to fall upon&#xD;
the water, she gazed into its liquid depths.&#xD;
"I knew on would be p leased with&#xD;
the scenery, ~~replied Edward "once be-&#xD;
fore, I visited the spot, and wSas perfectly&#xD;
fascinated."&#xD;
Look, Harriet, you can see the fish far&#xD;
down in the water."&#xD;
"It is your lakes that render the North&#xD;
so much more attractive than the South,"&#xD;
observed Maitland, a Sonthron.&#xD;
"Ah., is that the only reason why we&#xD;
should claim superiority P' said Miss Den-&#xD;
nison, archly.&#xD;
"In the presence of four such nymphs,&#xD;
who are fit representatives of Diana, Ve-&#xD;
nus, Hebe, and Juno, it is extremely diffi-&#xD;
cult to p reserve my allegiance to the South.&#xD;
Nevertheless-"&#xD;
"Well, proceed," said Fanny, as the&#xD;
maidens turned their bright glances upon&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Really, ladies, such a formidable bat-&#xD;
tery makes me falter; yetd e'en must pro-&#xD;
ceed. If you were at the South, you would&#xD;
be considered Southern ladies. I cannot&#xD;
say as much of many Northern females."&#xD;
"In what consists the differenceV' in-&#xD;
quired Kelborn.&#xD;
"As for personal beauty, I can discover&#xD;
none. Every portion of the Union can&#xD;
boast the possession of lovely women. I&#xD;
do not recollect ever passing through the&#xD;
smallest village without beholdinga charm-&#xD;
ing face and figure."&#xD;
"Oh, any American will proclaim that&#xD;
fact," cried Clifton; "but it is of manners&#xD;
that we would hear you speak."&#xD;
Now, fairly driven, to the wall, Mait-&#xD;
land continued: "I think the difference&#xD;
betweenn ladies educated in the slavehold-&#xD;
ing and non-slaveholding States, is caused,&#xD;
not altogether by climate, but, to a certain&#xD;
degree, by local conventionalities. That&#xD;
climate is not without its influence, is ap-&#xD;
parent from the fiery impetuosity of races&#xD;
~vhose pulses throb beneath the rays' of a&#xD;
tropical sun, compared with the calm judg-&#xD;
ments of those who are nurtured beneath&#xD;
&#xD;
29&#xD;
&#xD;
more temperate skies. But each segment&#xD;
of the confederacy possesses its own regu-&#xD;
lations, and when society conforms to&#xD;
them, every obligation is discharged. In&#xD;
France, young ladies are kept in the back-&#xD;
ground until they are married, and then&#xD;
become candidates for admiration. In the&#xD;
United States, maidens alone claim uni-&#xD;
versal fealty, arid relinquish it for that of&#xD;
one individual, when they stand at the al-&#xD;
tar. At the South, there is simply greater&#xD;
latitude given to unmarried ladies than at&#xD;
the North. They do not transcend the&#xD;
bounds of propriety, but its limits are not&#xD;
so narrow and confined. Fashion does&#xD;
not lace them so tightly, and their move-&#xD;
mentspossess more freedom and elasticity."&#xD;
"A very good explanation," said Mis-&#xD;
tress Batchelor, sententiously.&#xD;
"In no ~vay are the characteristics of&#xD;
the rival sections better indicated,~~ con-&#xD;
tinued Maitland, "than in their laughter.&#xD;
A Southern girl yields to her merriment in&#xD;
joyous and unrestrained hilarity, while at&#xD;
the North mirth is confined, with but rare&#xD;
exceptions, to an affected smile, or a sup-&#xD;
pressed giggle."&#xD;
The earnestness with which he ex-&#xD;
pressed his opinions caused the laughter&#xD;
of the ladies to ring merrily upon the air.&#xD;
"By Jove! that's worth hearing~, " ex-&#xD;
claimed the Mississippian, bringing his&#xD;
hand down upon his thigh in real Tom&#xD;
Crop style.&#xD;
"We may then infer that gentlemen&#xD;
become sooner acquainted with Southern&#xD;
than with Northern ladies," remarked Miss&#xD;
Salisbury.&#xD;
"We sooner feel at ease in their pre-&#xD;
sence. Where there is ait absence of stiff-&#xD;
ness in the manners of a lady, a gentle-&#xD;
man is relieved of that pain ul restraint,&#xD;
which is always embarrassing. Stiffness&#xD;
is rarely discoverable in a Southern girl,&#xD;
while it is often noticed in a Northerner.&#xD;
The one is not affected by what the other&#xD;
is forced to overcome."&#xD;
"Admirable !" ejn~,ulated Mistress&#xD;
Batchelor.&#xD;
"What think you of our sex l" inquired&#xD;
French&#xD;
"The wealthy Southerner is not forced&#xD;
to devote hi~ time to a calculation of dol-&#xD;
lars and cents, and can therefore employ&#xD;
his thoughts upon subjects more intellec-&#xD;
tual. His views are enlarged and liberal,&#xD;
and, in some instances, possessing the cul-&#xD;
tivation of the English peer, he maintains&#xD;
that unyielding opposition to unlawful en-&#xD;
croachments which distinguished the feu-&#xD;
dal barons."&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
"What effect does slavery have upon&#xD;
their personal bearing I"&#xD;
"Existing among an inferi'br race, they&#xD;
are not quite so amiable as certain persons&#xD;
I could name; but the code of honour&#xD;
keeps the unamiable within the bounds of&#xD;
courtesy. But I am exhausted with much&#xD;
talking. See, what an exquisite spot I"&#xD;
~The barge, in tacking, swept down in&#xD;
the direction of a small island, covered&#xD;
with trees in full bloom. From the shady&#xD;
bower floated towards them the perfume&#xD;
of the crab-apple, the plum, and t~ie&#xD;
peach.&#xD;
"Can we not land~ I should so much&#xD;
like to explore it," eagerly observed 'Fan-&#xD;
ny Brenton.&#xD;
"' Certainly, if you all desire it," replied&#xD;
Edward. "We have ample time to gra-&#xD;
tify every wish."&#xD;
"0n the other side,~~ remarked the&#xD;
boatman, "is the best place for landing,&#xD;
and we can easily make it with the oars."&#xD;
In a few minutes the prow grated upon&#xD;
the pebbly beach, and they were walking&#xD;
amidst the thick foliage that shaded the&#xD;
earth. The damsels gracefully elevated&#xD;
their dresses, almost as decidedly as a New&#xD;
York lady of a rainy day, and half wind-&#xD;
ing the ample drapery around their limbs,&#xD;
they soon arrived at the summit of the&#xD;
island. It was a large rock, which reared&#xD;
its bald head above the shrubbery, and&#xD;
gave them an extensive view of the sur-&#xD;
rounding scenery. The most prominent&#xD;
object was Mount Vista. It now began&#xD;
to lose the smooth exterior with which&#xD;
distance had clothed it, and to exhibit its&#xD;
rough outlines and yawning chasms. Blos-&#xD;
soms of pink and white, mingling with&#xD;
the foliage of the maple and the deeper&#xD;
green of the hemlock, made the innu-&#xD;
merable islands that rose from the undu-&#xD;
lating water appear like bouquets reposing&#xD;
upon the bosoms of youth and beauty.&#xD;
"Did you ever behold anything so love-&#xD;
ly !" exclaimed the enthusiastic Miss&#xD;
Salisbury.&#xD;
"Never," said Kelbom, "it is unap-&#xD;
proachable. Maitland, this would almost&#xD;
reconcile you to a life in the North."&#xD;
"Undoubtedly, if I was always sur-&#xD;
rounded by such loveliness !" and he gal-&#xD;
lantly bowed to the ladies, while his eye&#xD;
rested for a moment upon the bewitching&#xD;
form of Carlie Dennison.&#xD;
"If you have admired the prospect&#xD;
enough," said Mistress Batchelor "we had&#xD;
better descend to the shade. Time rays of&#xD;
the sun fall upon this rock with too much&#xD;
warmth."&#xD;
"Let us rest a minute here ;" and Fan-&#xD;

ny Brenton reclined upon the flowering&#xD;
bed. Her companions were soon grouped&#xD;
around her, while the young men beat the&#xD;
island in search of game.&#xD;
"Carlie, you have made a conquest of&#xD;
the Mississippian."&#xD;
"flow absurd! Why, I am but a school-&#xD;
girl."&#xD;
"You are old enough to blush very red,&#xD;
notwithstanding."&#xD;
"Hush! Batchelor will hear you, and&#xD;
then her sharp eyes will be always watch-&#xD;
ing us."&#xD;
"I think harriet may congratulate her-&#xD;
self upon captivating Mr. Clifton," oh-&#xD;
servedYanny, in a constrained voice.&#xD;
'' Ha! ha! ha !" merrily laughed Miss&#xD;
Salisbury; "with what mournful accents&#xD;
the charge is made. Relieve your mind,&#xD;
my dear Fan; we are only devoted-&#xD;
frier~ds, that is all, I assure you."&#xD;
"I do dot see what reason you have for&#xD;
supposing that 1 am at all interested in the&#xD;
gentleman," quickly retorted the maiden.&#xD;
"Oh! I make no such insinuations;~ how-&#xD;
ever, a gallant beau rarely perils his life&#xD;
in chastising the calumniator of a female,&#xD;
without acquiring a lively interest in her&#xD;
future ~&#xD;
"Pshaw! he was insulted himself in&#xD;
my presence; and, besides, his feelings&#xD;
were grossly outraged the same day, and&#xD;
before the assembled school."&#xD;
"'You~ seem to be perfectly apprised of&#xD;
the facts, and to express your feeling as&#xD;
though they were slightly enlisted in be-&#xD;
half of the gallant chevalier."&#xD;
"If you will persist in misunderstanding&#xD;
me, let us change the subject"-and the&#xD;
warm blood flowed to her cheek, and&#xD;
threatened to burst through its slight bar-&#xD;
rier.&#xD;
In a few minutes they were sailing&#xD;
through the archipelago, and an hour had&#xD;
not elapsed before the boat was moored&#xD;
in a brook that flowed into the lake from&#xD;
the base of Mount Vista.&#xD;
"Now, ladies, you can seek for wild&#xD;
flowers, which abound here, ~ said Clifton,&#xD;
"while we pitch the tent and prepare our&#xD;
meal, for air and exercise must have made&#xD;
you hungry."&#xD;
French and Kelbom arranged their hooks&#xD;
~nd lines, and seating themselves upon a&#xD;
projecting rock, cast them into the lake.&#xD;
Maitlandthrew arifle upon his shoulderand&#xD;
plunged into the forest in pursuit of game,&#xD;
while Clifton sought a spot upon which to&#xD;
erect the tent. A few yards from the shore&#xD;
of the lake he discovered a small plain,&#xD;
densely covered with hemlock, spruce,&#xD;
&#xD;
CLIF&#xD;
&#xD;
and "hardwood."* It was bounded upon&#xD;
one side by an acclivity, from which burst&#xD;
forth a delicious fountain, while upon the&#xD;
other the mountain stream glided murmur-&#xD;
ingpast. In front, glimpses of the lake&#xD;
were caught through the leaves, and be-&#xD;
hind, the lofty summit of Mount Vista was&#xD;
seen above the fleecy clouds which en-&#xD;
circled its majestic brow.&#xD;
A space sufficiently large was cleared of&#xD;
timber, the tent was soon erected, and the&#xD;
baggage transferred thither. The fisher-&#xD;
men had fine sport, and in an hour landed&#xD;
a dozen speckled trout and two lunge,&#xD;
while Maitland brought in three pheasants&#xD;
and a fawn.&#xD;
The ladies had scarcely returned from&#xD;
the mountain-side and arranged their&#xD;
flowers before the y were summoned to&#xD;
dinner. A yustic table had been prepared&#xD;
from the bark of the spruce, and upon this&#xD;
the food was spread-venison, pheasants.&#xD;
trout, roast potatoes, bread, butter, and&#xD;
cheese, besides an abundance of delicacies&#xD;
which were selected by the ladies, afforded&#xD;
th.em a delicious repast. It was now four&#xD;
o'clock, the sun was yet high in the hea-&#xD;
vens, but they had determined to postpone&#xD;
the ascent until the following day. For&#xD;
the present, then, Fanny superintended the&#xD;
manufacture of rustic seats, for which there&#xD;
was great demand; Harriet accompanied&#xD;
Kelborn in search of flowers- and Carlie~&#xD;
Mary, French, a~id Maitland sought the&#xD;
shore, for the purpose of fishing. The oil-&#xD;
cloth tent possessed sufficient capacity to&#xD;
accommodate the ladies and their maid:&#xD;
it was made in a circular form, coming to&#xD;
a point at the top; at the ground it was a&#xD;
dozen feet in diameter. A portion of the&#xD;
canvass could be rolled up, and gave to&#xD;
the inmates a ready egress. Hemlock&#xD;
boughs were first placed upon the earth,&#xD;
arid the mattresses were deposited upon&#xD;
them, and a couch was thus arranged fit&#xD;
for a queen to recline upon.&#xD;
"Why (10 you first cover the earth with&#xD;
these boughs 3" inquired Fanny.&#xD;
"Because hemlock will prevent you&#xD;
from taking cold, which would, assuredly,&#xD;
be the case if you slept upon the ground."&#xD;
"But I see no place or you, Mr. Ed-&#xD;
ward; there is only just enough space for&#xD;
us ladies within the tent."&#xD;
"Oh, we can throw ourselves under the&#xD;
trees; you see we have an abundant supply&#xD;
of boughs. If it rains moderately we have&#xD;
a cloth tent to protect us."&#xD;
"But if it storms 3"&#xD;
"In twenty minutes we can tear spruce&#xD;
* Socailed as contradistingulahed to evergreen trees.&#xD;
&#xD;
bark enough from the trees to shield us&#xD;
from its fury."&#xD;
"Do you really apprehend no danger&#xD;
from wild beasts 3 I begin to be alarmed&#xD;
as night approaches-"&#xD;
"Fear not; there are six good rifles to&#xD;
guard you, and our pallets will be so ar-&#xD;
ranged as to encompass the pavilion.~)&#xD;
"What do you think of this rustic seat3 Is&#xD;
not my mechanical skill quite creditable 3"&#xD;
"Truly, you surprise me. If it was&#xD;
fashioning a doll, your proficiency wo~ild&#xD;
not be as astonishing; but although I have&#xD;
always given you credit for being suffi-&#xD;
ciently sharp, still your knowledge of edged&#xD;
tools is mcomprehensrble.~~&#xD;
"Thank you, sir, for the implied compli-&#xD;
ment, yet my hand has not touched a single&#xD;
instrument."&#xD;
"Of course not."&#xD;
"Here come the anglers. What suc-&#xD;
cess, girls ~            -&#xD;
"Why, I caught five, and hooked up&#xD;
another," replied Mary Holmes; "but I&#xD;
don't believe Carlie had a nibble. She&#xD;
appeared, though, not to pay the slightest&#xD;
attention to her line-did you, Carlie 3"&#xD;
"Yes I did- but, do you know, Mr.&#xD;
Maitland kept talking so much that he&#xD;
frightened the fish away."&#xD;
"They must have been easily alarmed,&#xD;
for he conversed in very low tones, scarcely,&#xD;
indeed, above a whisper.~~&#xD;
"Their nerves, then, must be affected&#xD;
by the vibration of indistinct sounds upon&#xD;
the water. At all events, if they could not&#xD;
hear, they could see, as the lake is trans-&#xD;
parent, and, I believe, all fish are blessed&#xD;
with sight."&#xD;
"They are, when circumstances require&#xD;
it," obserVed M-pitland. "It is a well-au-&#xD;
thenticated fact that fish are found without&#xD;
eyes, in the Mammoth Cave, where they&#xD;
are surrounded by eternal gloom."&#xD;
They were all gathered around the tea-&#xD;
table. Long rustic benches had been&#xD;
made, so that every one was seated. The&#xD;
ladies alternately presided at the table.&#xD;
Harriet Salisbury now had that honour and&#xD;
responsibility.&#xD;
"Did I understand you, M~ Maitland,"&#xD;
said Mistress Batchelor, ~' as expressing&#xD;
your approval of the so-called code of'&#xD;
honour."&#xD;
"Certainly, Madame. I think a fatal&#xD;
mistake is committed when laws are passed&#xD;
to suppress duelling."&#xD;
"Is it possible! and wherefore 3"&#xD;
"For more reasons than I can well enu-&#xD;
merate. In the first place, the effect of&#xD;
duelling is to keep lawlessand unprincipled&#xD;
men under ~ wholesome restraint."&#xD;

"But how much unhappiness does one&#xD;
fatal encounter bring upon the family of&#xD;
the duellist !" observed Fanny Brenton.&#xD;
"That is very true; but the same remark&#xD;
is applicable to every conflict of arms; and&#xD;
those persons who sanction aggressive, as&#xD;
~well as defensive wars, forget that thQy are&#xD;
inconsistent in denouncing a single com-&#xD;
bat."&#xD;
"But national wars are prosecuted to&#xD;
attain some general good," remarked Car-&#xD;
lie Dennison.&#xD;
"Sometimes, not always. Probably&#xD;
more than half the blood that has watered&#xD;
th~ battle-fields of the old world has been&#xD;
shed in the prosecution of unjust quarrels.&#xD;
But if defensive wars are waged for the&#xD;
accomplishment of some general good, it&#xD;
may be said of duelling, that it as ,often&#xD;
occurs for the punishment of some private&#xD;
wrong.~~&#xD;
"That which may be excusable in a&#xD;
nation can hardly be pardoned in an indi-&#xD;
vidual," snia French.&#xD;
"And why not 3" responded the Missis-&#xD;
sipian; "individuals compose nations, and&#xD;
I see not why, as a unit, I may not exer-&#xD;
cise those rights that the American people,&#xD;
as a mass, undoubtedly claim as a pre-&#xD;
rogative."&#xD;
"But, ~ said Kelborn, "cer-&#xD;
tain powers have been delegated by the&#xD;
people to the general and state govern-&#xD;
ments. To the former, the right to declare&#xD;
war-to the latter, the redress of private&#xD;
grievances; and having transferred those&#xD;
powers, they are now beyond our control."&#xD;
"It is that of which I complain in the&#xD;
laws of duelling."&#xD;
"Are not our laws sufficiently stringent,~~&#xD;
inquired Mistress Batchelor, "to prevent&#xD;
crime ~"&#xD;
"No: if they were written in blood,&#xD;
offences would be committed" said&#xD;
French.&#xD;
"I admit," continued the Sonthron,&#xD;
"that our statutes are sufficiently severe in&#xD;
most instances, bait there are~ cases affect-&#xD;
ing personal honour, where they are wholly&#xD;
inadequate."&#xD;
"But when antagonists meet upon the&#xD;
field of honour, is not the culprit o ten vic-&#xD;
torious 3" timidly inquired Mary Holmes.&#xD;
"That is true: but the hazard will fre-&#xD;
~uently keep hini within the bounds of pm-&#xD;
"I have been informed," said Mistress&#xD;
Batchelor, "that a verbal insult will pro-&#xD;
duce a challenge. Is it so 3"&#xD;
"Un questionably,)~ remarked Clifton;&#xD;
"and therein consists one of the chief&#xD;
excellences of the code. Wrangling is&#xD;

~' But suppose one's honour is not alto-&#xD;

"So it injures not yourself," said Clifton,&#xD;
"let others assume the Quixotic task of&#xD;
assailing it."&#xD;
"Would an imputation upon your&#xD;
veracity induce you to challenge a fellow-&#xD;

"Certainly; far better do that than&#xD;
bandy words, which not only degrade&#xD;
yourself, but annoy others."&#xD;
"But suppose a person who is not a&#xD;
gentleman insults you V'&#xD;
"He could not."&#xD;
"Would any one who is, be guilty of a&#xD;
mean act V' suggested Fanny Brenton.&#xD;
"Of what is generally understood as&#xD;
a mean action, a gentleman could not be&#xD;
chargeable.~~&#xD;
~C Why are duels ever fought, thenP'&#xD;
"Misapprehension, violent anger, irre-&#xD;
sistible passion, will frequently cause re-&#xD;
sentment, and require atonement. No one&#xD;
can observe the amazingcontrast in the per-&#xD;
sonal bearing of gentlemen at the North and&#xD;
South without regretting that duelling is&#xD;
not sanctioned by public~pinion. When&#xD;
last in one of the Northern cities, I attend-&#xD;
ed' a session of the court, and was asto-&#xD;
nished to hear epithets bai~idied by learned&#xD;
members of the bar, which would have&#xD;
disgraced a blackguard. "Tis false,' and&#xD;
'you lie,' passed as freely as the ordinary&#xD;
phrase, 'gentlemen of the jury.'"&#xD;
"Such language is infamous," mur-&#xD;
mured Miss Dennison.&#xD;
"Not only 'are such expressions heard&#xD;
at the ~ pursued the Mississippian,&#xD;
"but they are tolerated in the legislative&#xD;
halls~ and dishonour those who utter them,&#xD;
as well as the constituency whom they&#xD;
represent."&#xD;
"Let the injured person attack his foe&#xD;
on sight," said Kelborn.&#xD;
"You have surrendered the argument"&#xD;
replied Clifton. "If you ~tdmit the rigilt&#xD;
of personal combat, in any form, you con-&#xD;
cede all we ask. All I claim is the right&#xD;
to punish certain breaches of etiquette,&#xD;
with the strong arm. The only difference&#xD;
between us is this: the method you pro-&#xD;
pdse is much more objectionable th an&#xD;
mine. You would assail your opponent,&#xD;
not only in the streets where you would&#xD;
endanger the lives of1 innocent persons,&#xD;
but you might be guilty of attacking him~&#xD;
with weapons in your hands at a time&#xD;
when he was unarmed. Besides, the cer-&#xD;
tainty of witnessing the measurement of&#xD;
the ground-as if they were taking the&#xD;

N&#xD;

C L IFTO0N.&#xD;
&#xD;
dimensions of your coffin-the steady ele-&#xD;
vation of a pistol until it comes in a line&#xD;
with your heart; the startling explosion,&#xD;
the tearing of flesh, and the crushing of&#xD;
bones, is far more appalling than the un-&#xD;
certain chances of a Street fight, which,&#xD;
if it ever occurs, may be interrupted be-&#xD;
fore blood is ~&#xD;
"The objection you have made as to&#xD;
attacking him when he is unarmed can be&#xD;
obviated by sending your opponent word&#xD;
to prepare ~ observed French.&#xD;
"Not at all, for then there will be a&#xD;
struggle for superiority of weapons, and&#xD;
the aggressor may triumph. No, no; the&#xD;
fairest method, and one the most satisfac-&#xD;
tory in its results, is to appoint a meet-&#xD;
ing for the antagonists, when no oth r&#xD;
person can be injured, and where, with&#xD;
similar we~tpons, they can fight it out.&#xD;
Un~iI that is done, there is no immunity&#xD;
from insult; unless we sanction murderous&#xD;
encounters upon the public streets ~&#xD;
The full moon now cast her beams&#xD;
along the water, and here and there,&#xD;
piercing the leafy bower, threw a pale&#xD;
arid steady light upon the encampment.&#xD;
Not a breath of air rippled the bosom of&#xD;
the lake, and no sound disturbed the still-&#xD;
ness of the night, save the murmur of the&#xD;
waterfall.&#xD;
"Let us walk to the beach," proposed&#xD;
Maitland.&#xD;
The ladies all declined except Carlie.&#xD;
They were too much fatigued.&#xD;
"Will you not go too ?" inquired Clifton&#xD;
of Fanny Brenton.&#xD;
For a moment she hesitated, until her&#xD;
glance sought his dark eyes, and then,&#xD;
with a blush, she assented.&#xD;
"Shall I not get your shawP the night&#xD;
air may chill you ;" and adjusting it upon&#xD;
her graceful shoulders, they followed the&#xD;
retreating forms of Maitland and Carlie&#xD;
Dennison.&#xD;
Seating themselves upon a rock which&#xD;
jutted into the lake, some distance from&#xD;
the Mississippian and his companion, they&#xD;
gazed upon the splendid scene before&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"Is not this' enchantment ~" murmured&#xD;
Fanny.&#xD;
"I am often apprehensive that it is so,"&#xD;
replied Clifton, with a significant smile, as&#xD;
he surveyed her person.&#xD;
"Nonsense! why will !IOU talk soV'&#xD;
"Because I feel thus," said her com-&#xD;
panion seriously.&#xD;
"If you do, I may take effectual mea-&#xD;
sures to convince you of my mortality,~~&#xD;
and she raised her openhandthreateningly.&#xD;
&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
33&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am willing to be thus undeceived&#xD;
he turned his cheek submissively.&#xD;
"What is that ?" whispered the maiden&#xD;
anxiously. A momentary silence suc-&#xD;
ceeded the plunge into the lake, and then&#xD;
an antlered denizen of the forest slowly&#xD;
emerged from the bushes which overhung&#xD;
the shore. Standing in the cooling ele-&#xD;
ment, he raised his noble head, and gazed&#xD;
f      half startled upon the wonders of his soli-&#xD;
tude. Fanny heard the stealthy tread of&#xD;
some person advancing through the forest,&#xD;
andtu rning her head, she saw young Kel-&#xD;
born cautiously pushing his rifle through&#xD;
the clustering branches which intercepted&#xD;
his view. At once divining his intentions,&#xD;
she rose suddenly, and , waving her hand-&#xD;
kerchief, shouted to the deer. Alarmed&#xD;
at her musical voice, the animal bounded&#xD;
toward the land; but the leaden messen-&#xD;
ger spe(l too swiftly. The echo of the&#xD;
rifle had scarcely died away, when the&#xD;
lifeless form of the deer sank on the beach.&#xD;
"Alas! I was too lafe. How could you&#xD;
have the heart to slay so beautiful a crea-&#xD;
ture ~&#xD;
"He deserved death, because lie fled&#xD;
from you."&#xD;
"Ah, the poor thing: he stood so trust-&#xD;
ingly, I cannot forgive 'you for killing&#xD;
him."&#xD;
'"if 1 had known you would take his&#xD;
death so much at heart, I would have suf-&#xD;
fered him to escape; you witl survive it,&#xD;
though, Miss Fanny, and doubtless will&#xD;
partake of the venison to-morrow morning.&#xD;
Here, Sam, transfer the deer to your lar-&#xD;
der,,~ and the light-hearted hunter saun-&#xD;
tered along the shore.&#xD;
"Shall we return to the encampment ?~'&#xD;
inquired Carlie.&#xD;
"Certainly, if you wish it," and musing&#xD;
she adjusted her shawl, in doing which,&#xD;
she lost her balance, and would have been&#xD;
precipitated into the lake, but for the&#xD;
timely interposition of Maitland, who&#xD;
threw his arm around her waist, and drew&#xD;
her away. A suppressed shriek escaped&#xD;
her lips, and in her terror, she for a mo-&#xD;
ment hid her face upon his shoulder, then&#xD;
quickly dra~ving back, she darted towards&#xD;
the tent, and throwing herself upon the&#xD;
couch, wept bitterly.&#xD;
"Why what is the matter Carlie V' said&#xD;
Mistress Batchelor anxiously.&#xD;
"Oh nothing," said the sobbing girl,&#xD;
"only I came very near falling into the&#xD;
xvater, )~ and she thought, " What will he&#xD;
think of me&#xD;
"Do not weep for that, now the danger&#xD;
is past, but you must be more careful in&#xD;
future."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Indeed I xvill.'&#xD;
"Come, girls, it is time for us to retire,"&#xD;
said the matron; "see, how well our&#xD;
couches are arranged."&#xD;
"Good night, ladies! sleep without a&#xD;
care, for we will protect you."&#xD;
"We doubt it not," said the pleasant&#xD;
voice of Fanny; "may you have pleasant&#xD;
dreams under your starry canopy."&#xD;
A sentinel was stationed 'to guard the&#xD;
tent, who was to be relieved at midnight.&#xD;
All but Clifton threw themselves upon the&#xD;
boughs, and so on lost the sense of plea-&#xD;
sure or of pain, in deep sleep. Seating&#xD;
himself at the foot of a lofty maple, with&#xD;
his rifle across his knees, he looked out&#xD;
upon the lake: a breeze began to agitate&#xD;
the water, and waves in miniature, laved&#xD;
the beach. The glittering myriads with&#xD;
which the blue vault of heaven was&#xD;
illuminated, each sent a ray of light from&#xD;
its far-off hom~,to cheet the guardian of&#xD;
innocence and youth.&#xD;
Clifton caught the low and melodious&#xD;
notes of a female voice, as it sang:&#xD;
"Sleeping, I dreamed, love,&#xD;
Dreamed love, of thee."&#xD;
Did he recognize the voice ~ He thought&#xD;
so.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;

wsnTTIER.&#xD;
TRE sun was gilding the waters of the&#xD;
lake with his golden hues, when Fanny&#xD;
Brenton and Harriet Salisbury, emerged&#xD;
from the tent, as gay and happy as the lark.&#xD;
Kelborn and Maitland were fishing, and&#xD;
French was pursuing game, while Clifton&#xD;
was still slumberiiig upon his simple bed.&#xD;
As the damsels went trippingly along, they&#xD;
paused a moment, and gazed upon the&#xD;
sleeper. Fanny cast a half-tender glance&#xD;
upon him as she murmured, " Poor youth!&#xD;
you deprived yourself of sleep, to protect&#xD;
us fr6m danger." They were soon per-&#xD;
forming their ablutions in the transparent&#xD;
waters of the lake.&#xD;

&#xD;
At an early hour they were seated at the&#xD;
break-fast able.&#xD;
"We have a toilsome journey before ud,&#xD;
and niust soon be on our way," remarked&#xD;
,Clifton. ~'I am afraid the ladies will find&#xD;
it very fatiguing."&#xD;
"Never fear but that we can perform ~&#xD;
replied Harriet. "Do you not recollect how&#xD;
often I used to tire you at play 3"&#xD;
"That was when we were children."&#xD;
"Will you venture upon the ascent,&#xD;
Mrs. BatchelorV'&#xD;
"I think not; if the ladies xviii promise.&#xD;
to be careful, and not fall down the pre-&#xD;
cipice.~~&#xD;
"Of course we shall avoid such a horri-&#xD;
ble death."&#xD;
"Well then, I will remain here with'&#xD;
Polly and Samuel, and have your tea ready&#xD;
by the tim e you return."&#xD;
Thomas was directed to take along some&#xD;
refreshments, and a I arge hatchet, while&#xD;
the young men each l5ore a rifle and a&#xD;
covering to protect the ladies from the&#xD;
mountain air.&#xD;
The demeanour of Miss Dennison towards&#xD;
all except Maitland, was flank and cordial.&#xD;
Her brilliant conversation, and fascinating&#xD;
manners, inspired the gentl-emen with the&#xD;
warmest admiration, and even the ladies&#xD;
were surprised at the exhibition of such&#xD;
extraordinary, powers. Her cheeks were&#xD;
flushed and her eyes sparkled with an nit-&#xD;
natural fire. It was evident that some&#xD;
powerful emotion agitated her, which none&#xD;
but Maitland could divine. Grieved that&#xD;
he had been the innocent cause of her&#xD;
suffering, he endeavored to soothe the&#xD;
maiden by his respectful bearing. His ad-&#xD;
vances being indignantly repulsed, he drew&#xD;
haughtily away, and for the remainder of&#xD;
the ascent devoted himself assiduously to&#xD;
Mary Holmes. Angry at having offended&#xD;
the Mississippian without a cause, Carlie&#xD;
now relapsed into silence. About a mile&#xD;
from the encampment was a delicious&#xD;
spring, and here they paused to slake their&#xD;
thirst. Hitherto the acclivity had been&#xD;
easily surmounted, but now it became&#xD;
more rugged and precipitous, and it was&#xD;
xvith considerable difficulty that the&#xD;
maidens proceeded on their toilsome way.&#xD;
"Ladies, you must allow us to assist&#xD;
you," said Edward, "or else your strength&#xD;
will be exhausted before we have ad-&#xD;
vanc~d half way to the summit. Come,&#xD;
Fanny, take my ~&#xD;
"Very well; you will find me a heavy&#xD;
burden, though."&#xD;
"It is said that every man has to bear&#xD;
a cross; I care not, so mine is not a cross&#xD;
lady," exclaimed Maitland, casting a&#xD;
&#xD;
spiteful, though furtive glance at Miss&#xD;
Den nison.&#xD;
"How now, Maitland! you have not be-&#xD;
come a grum h~ler 3" said French.&#xD;
"Not exactly, though I do not profess to&#xD;
have the patience of Job."&#xD;
"That is because you do not possess&#xD;
Job's wife to test it," replied Kelborl~,&#xD;
irreverently.&#xD;
The mountain, thus~ far, was thickly&#xD;
covered with forest trees, but now they&#xD;
emerged from beneath this foliage and&#xD;
entered a growth of stunted spruce, from&#xD;
the bark of which they obtained a large&#xD;
supply of delicious gum.*&#xD;
" Oh, there is a prize do get it for me,&#xD;
Mr. French," exclaimed Mary Holmes; "it&#xD;
looks like coraL" It exhibited its blushing&#xD;
outlines twenty feet up the tree.&#xD;
"What a request, Mary !" said Harriet.&#xD;
"Mr. George does not possess wings nor&#xD;
claws."&#xD;
"I did not think of the distance; pray&#xD;
do noi make the attempt," said the anx-&#xD;
ions girl. But her remonstrance came too&#xD;
late; already French had leaped into the&#xD;
branches of a beech which reared its trunk&#xD;
in close proximity to the straight, limbless&#xD;
spruce~ They all watched his progress, as,&#xD;
passing out upon a j)rojecting braitch, he&#xD;
inserted his knife under the bark, and the&#xD;
gum fell to the earth. In performing this&#xD;
feat, the limb upon which he stood broke.&#xD;
and he was precipitated half way to the&#xD;
earth, when he was caught by the cluster-&#xD;
ing branches. Shrieks ~escaped froni the&#xD;
terrified girls.&#xD;
"What is the matter with Mary 3" The&#xD;
alarmed girl had fainted.&#xD;
When she was restored to consciousness ,&#xD;
Fren0ch was st~inding beside her uninjured.&#xD;
Pressing her hand upon her temple, she&#xD;
murmured, "I am so glad he escaped."&#xD;
"Really, friends," said Kelborn, "our&#xD;
excursion bids fair to be a romantic one.&#xD;
Already we have had a quarrel, a fall, and&#xD;
a faint. Allah be praised !"&#xD;
"You deserve to be banished from the&#xD;
party," said Harriet.&#xD;
"For what reason?"&#xD;
"Because you are so unfeeling."&#xD;
"Now that is a specimen of the world's&#xD;
judgment. If my nerves don't tremble&#xD;
naturally, I must make them. Everything&#xD;
must bend to conventionalities. If society&#xD;
declares that certain, events must produce&#xD;
a sensation, you must open your mouth,&#xD;
and your face must express the utmost&#xD;
astonishment. If the incidents are suffi-&#xD;

"If such are the regulations of society,&#xD;
I am sure you pay them very little reve-&#xD;
rence," said Mary tardy.&#xD;
"Well done, Mary; it is enough to dis-&#xD;
turb the placidity of even your temper,"&#xD;
said Fanny.&#xD;
the pedestrians entered the gulf, a nar-&#xD;
row, winding, and abrupt ascent under&#xD;
the overhanging mountain. Their progress&#xD;
was slo~v, now climbing over rocks and&#xD;
anon grasping the s~'rubs, which tenacious-&#xD;
ly clung for existence to the crevices of the&#xD;
mountain. They at last reached the' stair-&#xD;
case,' an almost perpendicular ascent of&#xD;
forty steps~ A rope had been attached to&#xD;
the rock, and with its support alone could&#xD;
the perilous summit be attained.&#xD;
"If you are sufficiently rested, ladies,"&#xD;
observed Clifton, "will you proceed 3"&#xD;
"You will make the ascent first, if you&#xD;
please, gentlemen,'~ said Fanny,'draxving&#xD;
back.&#xD;
"You must be extremely cautious, then.&#xD;
Even we cannot gaze upwards, lest the&#xD;
overhanging moi~ntain and flying clouds,&#xD;
should make us giddy and lightheaded."&#xD;
"Perhaps, then, we had better precede&#xD;
you, for it xvould be terrible to lose our&#xD;
consciousness midway 'that staircase, with-&#xD;
out having any one to sustain ~ said&#xD;
Miss Salisbury~&#xD;
"Why not remain here, where we are&#xD;
perfectly safe 3" inquired the timid Miss&#xD;
Holmes.&#xD;
"You will lose the glorious sight for&#xD;
which we have struggled so long."&#xD;
"Better that than our lives."~&#xD;
"It will never do to return without&#xD;
reaching the pinnacle. They would laugh&#xD;
at us," observed the spirited Carlie.&#xD;
"Come Mr. Kelborn, I will make the at-&#xD;
teifipt, ~ut you must follow my footsteps&#xD;
closely, so as to catch me if I fall."&#xD;
"Come then, Mr .Clifton," said Fanny;&#xD;
"recollect, you are responsible if I am&#xD;
killed." They all mounted the staircase,&#xD;
and in a few minutes, were assembled&#xD;
upon the highest elevation of the mountain.&#xD;
The view from the height was vast in&#xD;
extent. The lake was spread out at their&#xD;
feet, and far down, and only perceptible&#xD;
with a glass, was the solitary tent upon the&#xD;
shore. Over the lake, a champaign coun-&#xD;
try, highly cultivated, extended as far as&#xD;
the eye could pierce the distance. Behind&#xD;
was an illimitable forest, without a single&#xD;
clearing to relieve the eternal gloom that&#xD;
pervaded the solitude. At the foot of the&#xD;
&#xD;
35&#xD;
&#xD;
mountain, upon their left, they discovered&#xD;
a small sheet of water, which appeared&#xD;
separately scarce half a mile from the lake,&#xD;
and not double that distancee from the en~&#xD;
campment.&#xD;
"What a gem of a lake that is, nestling&#xD;
securely in the forest,~' said Harriet.&#xD;
"Can't we explore it on our return ?'~&#xD;
inquired Carlie. "Do you knoxv that in-&#xD;
terests me more than every other object&#xD;
within the scope of my vision."&#xD;
"We will examine that side of the&#xD;
mountain, before we start, to see if xve&#xD;
can descend xvithout danger," observed&#xD;
Clifton.&#xD;
After the party had iz~azed upon the&#xD;
scenery, they partook of some refresh-&#xD;
mnents. At that altitude the air was suf-&#xD;
ficiently cool to make shawls acceptable&#xD;
to the Ia(lies. It was now three o'clock,&#xD;
and they prepared to return. Clifton had&#xD;
ascertained that the only practicable path&#xD;
doxvn the mountain, was the one by which&#xD;
the ascent had been made.&#xD;
"What a beautiful floxver!" said Carlie.&#xD;
as she gazed over the precipice. "I must&#xD;
try and get it ;" and advancing rapidly&#xD;
along the brow of the mountain, she de-&#xD;
scended the shelving rock towards the&#xD;
coveted blossom. "Come back, do come&#xD;
back !" exclaimed Mary Holmes. Fanny&#xD;
and Harriet gasped their hands in mortal&#xD;
fear. While Maitland muttered, "Rash&#xD;
girl, you will be lost !'&#xD;
She succeeded 'in obtaining the object&#xD;
of her pursuit, but she had no sooner done.&#xD;
so, than, raising her eyes, her cheek be-&#xD;
came deadly pale, and tier head swam&#xD;
round, as she gazed with an irresistible&#xD;
impulse upon the yawning gulf at her feet.&#xD;
"For God's sake, withdraw your glance !"&#xD;
shouted the Mississippian. "Look upward~&#xD;
here, this way, dear Miss Carlie !"&#xD;
But thought, hearing, motion, were gone;&#xD;
her limbs relaxed, and h~r powerless form&#xD;
glided slowly down the polished rock, and&#xD;
disappeared from the sight of her terror-&#xD;
stricken companions. Without a moment's&#xD;
hesitation, Maitland darted along the&#xD;
verge of the rock, but inclining further&#xD;
to the left than the ill-fated girl had done,&#xD;
he approached a lower shelf in the moun-&#xD;
tain. Gaining this xvithi much difficulty, he&#xD;
advanced along its n~row surface. Above&#xD;
him was the overhanging stone; beloxv,&#xD;
axvay down as far as the sight could ex-&#xD;
tend, was a frightful chasm, which made&#xD;
his brain reel as he gazed into its depths.&#xD;
He shouted her name; no answer came&#xD;
back. "I knew she xvould belost-a'nd&#xD;
such a death !"&#xD;
4                       -&#xD;

36                  /          CLIF&#xD;
Hastening onwards, /~e ascertained that&#xD;
the rock gradually fdened, while the&#xD;
cliff above sloped neArly to the level of&#xD;
the platform.&#xD;
He caught a glimpse of female attire,&#xD;
and uttered a shout of gladness, but the&#xD;
blood instantly retreated to his heart, and&#xD;
his paralysed limbs were rooted to the&#xD;
stone, as he saw the motionless form of&#xD;
the maiden lying upon the shelving&#xD;
rock, her head hanging over the chasm,&#xD;
and the blood flowing from a wound in&#xD;
her temple. A slight movement of the&#xD;
hand assured him that life was not extinct,&#xD;
and bounding forward, he raise(l the un-&#xD;
conscious girl in his arms, and bore her&#xD;
rapidly along the platform towards the top&#xD;
of the mountain. Scarcely had he emerged&#xD;
from the ledge, whei~ he was met by Ed-&#xD;
ward and Kelborn, who were advancing to&#xD;
his assistance. The rapid motion and&#xD;
mountain air, restoreti Carlie to conscious-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
Opening her eyes, she looked for a mo-&#xD;
ment at her preserver, as if her mind wan-&#xD;
dered, and then recalling the fearful peril&#xD;
through which she had passed, a shudder&#xD;
ran through her frame.&#xD;
(C The danger is now past, ~nd you are&#xD;
safe," said the soothing voice of Maitland.&#xD;
Turning upon him a grateful look, she&#xD;
slightly contracted the muscles of the&#xD;
rounded arm that still encircled his neck,&#xD;
and then raising her form from his shoul-&#xD;
der, she threw herself, weeping, into the&#xD;
arms of Fanny Brenton.&#xD;
At night, the party were all assembled&#xD;
again, around the supper-table. The ad-&#xD;
ventures of the day were recounted to the&#xD;
matron, nnd they were all joyous and gay,&#xD;
except Carlie, and she was happy; but oc-&#xD;
casionally, there would pas ,across~ her&#xD;
countenance a sad and pen ye expres-&#xD;
sion. The near approach of eath had&#xD;
momentarily checked the exu erance of&#xD;
her spirits.&#xD;
Fatigued by the exertions' o the day,&#xD;
they all retired early.&#xD;
Two hearts were happy at the recon-&#xD;
ciliation which had taken pla , above the&#xD;
yawning gulf of Mount a.&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
"Hark, how the tempest crushes through the forest!&#xD;
The owls fly out in strange aifriglit;&#xD;
The columns of the evergreen palaces&#xD;
Are split and shattered;&#xD;
&#xD;
TO&#xD;
The roots creak, and stretch, and groan;  ~&#xD;
And, ruinously overthrown,&#xD;
The trunks are crushed and shattered&#xD;
By the fierce blast's unconquerable stress."&#xD;
GOETHE.&#xD;
BEFORE they arose from the brenkfast~&#xD;
table, the heavy clouds which had been&#xD;
gathering in the northwest, rolled towards&#xD;
the mountain, and the gleaming lightning&#xD;
was followed by peals of thunder that&#xD;
shook the earth. The atmosphere ~'as&#xD;
close, almost suffocating. The lake slum-&#xD;
bered as placidly as an infant reposing&#xD;
upon its mother's bosom. Profound silence&#xD;
reigned in the forest; but the calm xva~ the&#xD;
precursor of the tempest. Far up the&#xD;
mountain, the wind first toyed with the&#xD;
leaves, and then violently severing the&#xD;
branches, rudely twisted them from their&#xD;
truBks, and whirled them through the air.&#xD;
The top of Mount Vista was enveloped in&#xD;
a black mantle, and from its folds the&#xD;
forked lightning darted athwart that por-&#xD;
tion of the sky ~vhich still preserved its&#xD;
ethereal blue. The storm swept down the&#xD;
descent. Large drops of rain first disfigured&#xD;
the glossy surface of the lake, and then the&#xD;
hurricane descended upon it with such&#xD;
fury, that the water was lashed into a&#xD;
white foam.&#xD;
"You must all come into the tent," said&#xD;
Fanny, as she fearfully gazed upon the&#xD;
scene.&#xD;
Scarcely had they congregate(l beneath&#xD;
its folds, when the lightning descended&#xD;
upon a lofty maple which grew on the&#xD;
shore. Its trunk was riven, and the frag-&#xD;
ments scattered along the beach. The&#xD;
crash which accompanied, rather than fol-&#xD;
lowed the electric fluid, was appalling,&#xD;
while the atmosphere was charged with&#xD;
sulphurous smoke.&#xD;
The ladies concealed their faces, and&#xD;
the gentlemen gazed with serious counte-&#xD;
nances upon the progress of the storm.&#xD;
Even the gay and reckless Kelborn was&#xD;
subdued by its terrors. But the hurricane&#xD;
had gone past, and was nox~ spending its&#xD;
fury upon the opposite shore of the lake.&#xD;
"See !" exclaimed French, eagerly, "it&#xD;
has unroofed yonder mansion, and now it&#xD;
is playing with the trees in front of the&#xD;
white house, to the right. Look, it twists&#xD;
them off like reeds! Now it struggles&#xD;
with the dwelling. The glass-let me&#xD;
have the glass! By heavens, the inmates&#xD;
are flying! The house totters-it is a heap&#xD;
of ruins! See, the tempest now inclines to&#xD;
the left; it forces a passage through yonder&#xD;
grove. My God! i~ approaches the brick&#xD;
building. Surely that will resist it. N~s,&#xD;
no! 'fis awfirl! nothing but the foundation&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
C L I F T ON.&#xD;
&#xD;
remains." And he closed his eyes to shut&#xD;
out the terrible vision. When he looked&#xD;
again upon the scene, the tornado had&#xD;
swept over the table land which bounded&#xD;
the horizon in that direction.&#xD;
"I never beheld anything so terrific,"&#xD;
said Kelborn.&#xD;
"in our southern latitudes," responded&#xD;
Mainland, "we often witness the progress&#xD;
of destructive hurricanes."&#xD;
"Why are some localities so much&#xD;
oftener visited by tornadoes than others ?"&#xD;
inquired Harriet Salisbury.&#xD;
"I presume," said Maitland, "it is, to&#xD;
a &amp;amp;rtain degree, attributable to the con-&#xD;
figuration of the ground. I recollect one&#xD;
spot that was twice visited by hurricanes&#xD;
in ten years. Tile first time a court-house&#xD;
was' prostrated, and some of the papers&#xD;
were picked up more than fifty miles dis-&#xD;
tar t. It was observable that the course of&#xD;
the storm was nearly the same in both in-&#xD;
stances."&#xD;
"But I understand," said French, "that&#xD;
on the Western Prairies, where the wind&#xD;
has a fair sweep, they are never troubled&#xD;
with hurricanes."&#xD;
"That is, doubtless, the re'~son why&#xD;
there are none," said Edward. "It is only&#xD;
where the wind can find obstacles to resist&#xD;
its progress, that its pent-up fury prostrates&#xD;
everything before it."&#xD;
The sky was now overcast with clouds,&#xD;
and gave promise of a rainy day. Malt-&#xD;
land and French donned their thick over-&#xD;
coats, and prepared to sally forth upon a&#xD;
fishing excursion. Kelborn and our hero&#xD;
preferred the society of the ladies.&#xD;
"*Oh ye slothful !" exclaimed the Mis-&#xD;
"&#xD;
sissippian, . would you leave the ladies to&#xD;
perish for want of food'?"&#xD;
"You like the storm, and the rocking of&#xD;
the boat upon the waves," said Kelborn,&#xD;
"better than the society of the softer sex:&#xD;
we do not."&#xD;
The tender glance which Maitland be-&#xD;
stowed upon Carlie Dennison, was a refu-&#xD;
tation of this charge.&#xD;
''Let this protect you from the ~&#xD;
said the lovely maiden, as she advanced&#xD;
to the door of the tent with a silken scarf&#xD;
in her hand.&#xD;
"If you will adjust it."&#xD;
But he was obdurate and raising herself&#xD;
upon her tiny feet, she wound the scarf&#xD;
around his neck, while her taper fingers&#xD;
played about his cheeks as she arranged&#xD;
its folds. He sought her glance, but it was&#xD;
withheld until the last knot was tied, and&#xD;
then, for an instant, she raised her soft and&#xD;
melting eyes to his own.&#xD;
&#xD;
"And how do you purpose amusing&#xD;
yourselves, ladies'?" inquired Clifton.&#xD;
"I will show you,~~ said harriet and she&#xD;
took from her bag a piece of embroidery.&#xD;
The others were also employed with&#xD;
needles.&#xD;
"I can tell you how they would find&#xD;
amusement, even if their fingers were not&#xD;
employed," said Kelborn.&#xD;
"how'?" inquired Mary Holmes.&#xD;
"In conversation. I never could livinge&#xD;
how it was possible for your sex to while&#xD;
away so many hours in talking."&#xD;
"XV&#xD;
be hy if w'e (lid not converse, we should&#xD;
considered stupid,~~ said Fanny.&#xD;
"But ~vhat is there about half the con-&#xD;
versation which serves to amuse ladies but&#xD;
stupidity'?"&#xD;
"What an impertinent man !" exclaimed&#xD;
Carlie.&#xD;
" Now, let us see whether it is not the&#xD;
truth" continued Kelborn. "'1'wo friends&#xD;
meet: it ought to be p resumed that they&#xD;
feel some interest in the mental improve-&#xD;
ment of each other. What is the subject&#xD;
of the conversation'? They talk thus:&#xD;

"'Do you think so'? Well, would you&#xD;

"'Impossible! And such a beauty!&#xD;
Where did you buy it-at Jones's'?'&#xD;
"'No, indeed; I thought it was useless&#xD;

"'Have you purchased yours yet, Se-&#xD;

"'No; I thought I would be in no haste.&#xD;
I prefer looking round until I can suit my-&#xD;

"'How exquisite the silks are figured&#xD;

"'I thought they were not as pretty as&#xD;

"'Oh! I think-they are1perfectly charm-&#xD;

"'What! both'?'&#xD;
"'Well, how fashions do chang~.'&#xD;
'~ 'Yes, indeed. My dress-maker in-&#xD;
formed me to-day that the full sleeve was&#xD;
to be substituted by a tight one.'&#xD;
"'You don't tell me so! That ~vill be&#xD;

SHAKSPEARE.&#xD;
EDWARD C~n"rou and his three friends&#xD;
ha~ entered College, and as that Institution&#xD;
was also situated in the village, or rather&#xD;
city, of Andover, they were not separated&#xD;
from the young ladies, who were perfect-&#xD;
ing their knowledge of French, music, and&#xD;
painting.&#xD;
Several months after their return from&#xD;
the excursion to the lake, Clifton entered&#xD;
Kelhorn's room, where he found Maitland&#xD;
and French.&#xD;
"Well met, my comrades, .1 am glad to&#xD;
see you all."&#xD;
"Come in, then, and be seated. Here,&#xD;
tty one of these cigars.~'&#xD;
The Nue vapour curled along the ceil-&#xD;
ing, and through the white ashes t~e fire&#xD;
brightened into a glowing heat, and then I&#xD;
disappeared in a faint, shadowy light, as&#xD;
the grateful smoke was inhaled, or suffer-&#xD;
ed to float in waving lines through the&#xD;
apartment.&#xD;
"What think you now of your favourite&#xD;
system of intrusting the public money to&#xD;
the keeping of banks?" asked Edward.&#xD;
"Why, are there any more suspen-&#xD;
sions'?" inquired French.&#xD;
"There is now scarcely a specie-paying&#xD;
bank in the country."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Has the disaster become so general?"&#xD;
"Yes, commercial affairs seem to be&#xD;
stricken with paralysis, failures are daily&#xD;
occurring, and some of the oldest firms&#xD;
are yielding to the pressure.~~&#xD;
"That is one of the crises which some-&#xD;
times occur, and can hardly be attributa-&#xD;
ble to the deposit system," said French.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, it is the natural&#xD;
result of that very system, as avowed by&#xD;
its advocates."&#xD;
"How so?"&#xD;
"Why, the ~nincipal reason assigned.&#xD;
~r depositing the public moiiey with these&#xD;
pet banks, is to enable them to extend&#xD;
additional accommodations to commercial&#xD;
men. That is the reason assigned by the&#xD;
managers of banks, because it has an ap-&#xD;
pearance of disinterestedness, and as all&#xD;
persons like to have money plenty, the&#xD;
argument 4s a powerful one. But the real&#xD;
cause is a desire to flood the country with&#xD;
paper rags, based upon the five or six mnil-&#xD;
lions of government money depositedd in&#xD;
the vaults of these banks."&#xD;
"But if the government loses nothing&#xD;
by the operation, surely you cannot oh-&#xD;
ject.~&#xD;
"Yes. but I do though. I deny that the&#xD;
general government hns any right tofat'our&#xD;
pet institutions, or to establish a species of&#xD;
favoritism. I object to the principle.&#xD;
Besides, a blunder is committed in afford-&#xD;
ing facilities for overtrading, which brings&#xD;
pain and disaster upon the whole commu-&#xD;
nity."&#xD;
"Is it the fault of the government if&#xD;
people will overtrade 3"&#xD;
"Not if the government has had no&#xD;
agency in the transaction. If, on the con-&#xD;
trary, it has not only offered induce-&#xD;
ments, but afforded facilities for overtrad-&#xD;
ing, it has abandoned its legitimate sphere&#xD;
of operations.~)&#xD;
~d? Do you avow your hostility to all&#xD;
banks, Clifton ~&#xD;
"Unequivocally so, to all institutions&#xD;
now in operation in this country. I think&#xD;
it is the very worst feature that we have&#xD;
imported from Great Britain, and we shall&#xD;
regret the day when we engrafted it upon&#xD;
our republican institutions. Banks are char-&#xD;
tered becaus~people want more money,&#xD;
and in their eagerness they overlook the&#xD;
consequences. Private individuals are&#xD;
allowed to receive only seven per cent.&#xD;
interest in some states, in others only six.&#xD;
But to corporations the prtvilege is given&#xD;
of issuing three dollars in paper, some-&#xD;
times more, for every dollar in specie de-&#xD;
posited in their vaults. They are thus&#xD;
allowed to obtain three times as much&#xD;
&#xD;
interest upon their capital, as private indi-&#xD;
viduals. Not only that, but what is to pre-&#xD;
vent them from issuing five-ten times as&#xD;
much. paper, as they have silver and gold&#xD;
in their vaults 3"&#xD;
"Will not the fear of suspension or&#xD;
failure deter them 3" inquired Kelborn.&#xD;
I&#xD;
"Has it restrained them 3" continued&#xD;
Edward earnestly. "Are not the suspen-&#xD;
sions throughout the Union, an answer to&#xD;
your question 3 What do they lose by the&#xD;
suspension 3 They have acquired a valu-&#xD;
able consideration for their worthless paper,&#xD;
and the only sufferers are the unfortunate&#xD;
bill-holders, who are forced to sell the&#xD;
trash to brokers for one-fourth the sum&#xD;
j&#xD;
which it cost them, and are th expected&#xD;
to shout for joy when more ~ are char-&#xD;
tered, to a~ord temporary relief,-and to&#xD;
involve them again in the same difficulty."&#xD;
"If we are deprived of banks, there will&#xD;
be a frightful scarcity of money," said&#xD;
French.&#xD;
"You surely do not expect to increased&#xD;
substantial wealth of a country with b~nk&#xD;
paper? These matters will always regti-&#xD;
late themselves. If money is scarce,&#xD;
small amounts will 'go a great way,' as&#xD;
the saying is. If money is plenty, it ~~ill&#xD;
require a large sum to purchase a very few&#xD;
articles."&#xD;
"You cannot deny but that paper is&#xD;
vastly more convenient than silver to the&#xD;
traveller and merchant."&#xD;
"That depends very much upon the&#xD;
credit it sustains in the commercial world.&#xD;
There are millions of bank paper at the&#xD;
North, which would prove utterly worth-&#xD;
less south of Masons and Dixon's line.&#xD;
No, no, instead of banks of discount and&#xD;
circulation, I would create banks of de-&#xD;
posit. only."&#xD;
"How is that?"&#xD;
"If A. has a thousand dollars in specie&#xD;
let him deposit them in this bank, and&#xD;
obtain a certificate that he has there, sub-&#xD;
ject to his order, the sum of one thousand&#xD;
dollars-no more, no less. That certificate&#xD;
made transferable would pass as so much&#xD;
money."&#xD;
"I see how it is, gentlemen,~~ said&#xD;
Maitland, lighting another cigar; "you&#xD;
will have to abandon your theories and&#xD;
your pet banks, and come out in favour&#xD;
of that good old institution-a national&#xD;
bank."&#xD;
"That Zs far more objectionable than&#xD;
the other,' said Clifton.&#xD;
"Why that did not break or suspend,&#xD;
and its notes were current at par, some-&#xD;
times at a prentium, throughout the coun-&#xD;
try."&#xD;
&#xD;
"That it did not break or suspend, is&#xD;
probably owing to the credit and assistance&#xD;
of the general government. If that had&#xD;
been withdrawn, it unquestionably would&#xD;
have shared the fate of smaller institu-&#xD;
tions."&#xD;
"Well, continue to give it the support&#xD;
and countenance of the general govern-&#xD;
"The objection to favoritism and&#xD;
overtrading will apply as forcibly, per-&#xD;
haps more so, to a national, than to state&#xD;
"What in the name of common sense,&#xD;
would you do with the fu~{ the ge-&#xD;
neral government, if yo ~wouIX~intrust&#xD;
them neither to pet institt4ionsQrNUni -&#xD;
ted States Bank 3" said the Mississippian.&#xD;
"I will tell you. It was not the int6n-&#xD;
tion of the framers of the Constitution,&#xD;
that the funds of the government should&#xD;
be intrusted to banking institutions; on the&#xD;
contrary, it was designed that the revenues&#xD;
of the country, should be kept under the&#xD;
management of officers, appointed by,&#xD;
and uiider the immediate control of the&#xD;
general government. Language could not&#xD;
be more definite than that employed in&#xD;
framing the Constitution. Every word was&#xD;
carefully considered, that it might define&#xD;
the meaning of the Convention. It was&#xD;
explicitly declared that a treasury should&#xD;
be established, and no money drawn there-&#xD;
from, but in consequence of appropriations&#xD;
made by law. How can the revenues be&#xD;
taken from the treasury, for banking pur-&#xD;
poses, when the only legitimate use to&#xD;
which they can be applied, is to defray&#xD;
the expenses of the government, after ap-&#xD;
propriations have been made? That this&#xD;
was the intention of the framers of the&#xD;
Constitution, is apparent from the passage&#xD;
of the law of 1789, establishing the trea-&#xD;
sury department. After providing that the&#xD;
money should be received and kept in the&#xD;
treasury, and defining the mode in which&#xD;
it should be paid out, they enacted that no&#xD;
person appointed to office under that bill&#xD;
should, directly or indirectly, be concerned&#xD;
or interested fn carrying on the business&#xD;
of trade or commerce, or purchase or dis-&#xD;
pose of any public securities of any state&#xD;
or of the United States."&#xD;
"Then yot~ advocate the ultra doctrine&#xD;
of one kind of currency for the people,&#xD;
and another for the government as well as&#xD;
the sub-treasury." /&#xD;
"A law which enforces the collection&#xD;
of the public dues in gold and silver,&#xD;
recognizes the only constitutional currency.&#xD;
If the people have established banks&#xD;
which give them depreciated paper; it&#xD;

&#xD;
surely is not the fault of the general go-&#xD;
vernment."&#xD;
"Whatever may be your convictions&#xD;
upon the subject, you may rest assured of&#xD;
one thing, that the administration now in&#xD;
power will be defeated at the next election&#xD;
by an overwhelming majority," said Mait-&#xD;
land.&#xD;
"What causes will produce so fatal a&#xD;
result to a party which has held the reins&#xD;
so long 3" inquired Edward.&#xD;
"I think they kre quite apparent. In&#xD;
the first place, excessive overtrading has&#xD;
produced general distress and embarrass-&#xD;
ment throughout the country; upon every&#xD;
breeze you can hear the cry of 'Change!&#xD;
change!' Even sagacious and able men&#xD;
declare, that a new administration cannot&#xD;
make matters worse. Besides, the defal-&#xD;
cations which have recently occurred, will&#xD;
bring odium upon the President and his&#xD;
cabinet, and in the hands of a popular&#xD;
sturhp speaker, will bring hosts of demo-&#xD;
crats into the whig ranks. Why, a cele-&#xD;
brated Mississippi orator would electrify&#xD;
an audience with the materials which the&#xD;
present administration have placed in his&#xD;
power.~~&#xD;
"If it is the intention of the Whig party&#xD;
to avail themselves of a temporary embar-&#xD;
rassment, which their own policy has&#xD;
brought upon the country, it is not im-&#xD;
probable that they may succeed. How-&#xD;
ev~rI have great confidence in the honesty&#xD;
and intelligence of the people."&#xD;
"And I have none. They sustain re-&#xD;
publicanism in the abstract, because all&#xD;
aspirants for office find it is popular to Siud&#xD;
it. But think you they would hesitate to&#xD;
stretch the Constitution of the United States&#xD;
if it was necessary to accomplish a fa-&#xD;
vourite measure 3 Why you asserted a few&#xD;
minutes since, that gold and silver were&#xD;
the only constitutional currency, yet we&#xD;
have had two national banks chartered by&#xD;
the Congress of the United States, and&#xD;
another woula have been legislated into&#xD;
existence, but for the obstinate determina-&#xD;
tion of Old Hickory."&#xD;
"That was because General Washing-&#xD;
ton yielded to the advice of Alexander&#xD;
Hamilton and to the financial embarrass-&#xD;
merits into which the country had been&#xD;
precipitated by the revolutionary str~iggle."&#xD;
"But how do you account for the appro-&#xD;
val of the second bank, by President&#xD;
Madison 3"&#xD;
"We had just passed through the second&#xD;
contest with Great Britain, and the curren-&#xD;
cy of the country w~p in a deplorable con-&#xD;
dition. Instead of ~tting the evil remedy&#xD;
k&#xD;
&#xD;
itself, Madison, who wanted firmness,&#xD;
yielded to the pressure."&#xD;
"it is singular," pursued Maitland,&#xD;
"that the two national banks were sanc-&#xD;
tioned by members of the Constitutional&#xD;
Convention, and that it should have been&#xD;
left to the statesmen of the present day to&#xD;
arrest their career by the executive veto."&#xD;
"I often hear allusions made," said&#xD;
Clifton, "to the fact that Washington and&#xD;
Madison were members of the Convention.&#xD;
Suppose they were, what then 3 The&#xD;
present generation are as fully apprised of&#xD;
the opinions of that eminent body of men&#xD;
as the two members from Virginia, and we&#xD;
have only to consult the papers prepared&#xD;
by Mr. Madison himself to be convins~-&#xD;
ed that the Convention, as a body, was&#xD;
utterly opposed to a paper currency. In&#xD;
the draft of a constitution submitted by&#xD;
Mr. Rutledge, there was a clause autho-&#xD;
rizing Congress to emit bills of credit~&#xD;
which was rejected by a vote of nine&#xD;
states against two. While the clause was&#xD;
under discussion, the propriety of esta-&#xD;
blishiiig a paper currency was fully&#xD;
discussed, and almost universally con-&#xD;
demned."&#xD;
"And yet I cannot but express surprise&#xD;
at their extraordinary conversion."&#xD;
"The President of the Convention did&#xD;
not have occasion to give his opinion&#xD;
as to the necessity of a paper currency,&#xD;
but Mr. Madison exhibited a leaning in&#xD;
that direction."&#xD;
"James Madison !" exclaimed French.&#xD;
"Unquestionably," replied Edward.&#xD;
"When the clause authorizing Congress&#xD;
to emit bills of credit was under discus-&#xD;
sion, Mr. Madison was opposed to striking&#xD;
it out, but thought it was sufficient to pro-&#xD;
hibit the making those bills a legal tender.&#xD;
He remarked that such a prohibition would&#xD;
remove the temptation to emit them with&#xD;
unjust purposes, and promissory notes in&#xD;
that shape might, in some emergencies,&#xD;
be best."&#xD;
"Then he cannot be claimed as a con-&#xD;
vert, after all."&#xD;
"Certainly not. But even if he could,&#xD;
how would it settle the question 3 All you&#xD;
can proclaim is the fact that two states-&#xD;
men who happened to occupy the presi-&#xD;
dential chair when the country labored&#xD;
under financial distress, signed national&#xD;
bank charters. If Thomas Jefferson. vast-&#xD;
ly the superior of either, had occupied&#xD;
their positions, neither of those banks&#xD;
would have had an existence."&#xD;
"It is immaterial," said the Mississip-&#xD;
pian, "whether statesmen or politicians&#xD;
oppose banks; whenever the 'honest and&#xD;
&#xD;
lq&#xD;
&#xD;
intelligent people' are pinched for money,&#xD;
they will have them. The almighty&#xD;
dollar will become, directly or indirectly,&#xD;
a prominent principle in the dogmas of&#xD;
the two parties."&#xD;

SHAKSPEAaE.&#xD;
How rapidly time passes when our pro-&#xD;
gress at college satisfies exacting and&#xD;
ambitious parents. Mr. Clifton and his&#xD;
wife had watched with the greatest inte-&#xD;
rest the rapid advancement which Edward&#xD;
had made since he first left the paternal&#xD;
roof. The thoughts of his mother, it is&#xD;
true, had been principally directed to the&#xD;
preservation of his health, and she was&#xD;
urgent in her requests that he should pay&#xD;
a proper regard to his clothing and diet.&#xD;
Their visits to Andover had been frequent,&#xD;
and he never ran out to welcome them&#xD;
without expecting a bountiful sup~Iy of&#xD;
cakes and preserves, which in due time&#xD;
were divided among his favourites.&#xD;
"I can hardly realize that we have&#xD;
been one year at college, can you, Mait-&#xD;
land 3"&#xD;
CC That is because our moments of&#xD;
leisure are rendered so delightful by an&#xD;
agreeable circle of acquaintances."&#xD;
"True, that has an influence upon ima-&#xD;
ginative young gentlemen, who, like your-&#xD;
self are involved in the mysterious and&#xD;
inextricable mazes of love~" observed&#xD;
Clifton.&#xD;
(Cl do not thin~n you can claim exemp-&#xD;
tion from that charge your~elf.~~&#xD;
"I trust my attack has not been so pal;&#xD;
pable as thine. It is singular what an&#xD;
effect the preservation of a life has upon&#xD;
the ror~antic. We seem to invest the&#xD;
object with the rarest endowments, simply&#xD;
because we have been instrumental in&#xD;
prolonging an existence. This has been&#xD;
strikingly the cage with yourself, ever since&#xD;
the lovely C arlie was borne in your arms&#xD;
from the yawning abyss of Mount Vista."&#xD;
"Come, now, Clifton, acknowledge the&#xD;
fact; are you not slightly jealous because&#xD;
she blushes when I approach, and  is im-&#xD;
passive in your presence.~~&#xD;
"Ha! ha! that is so much like Shel-&#xD;
&#xD;
don Myers, who congratulated himself&#xD;
that the whole world had not fallen in with&#xD;
'his Nancy,' for then he might have had&#xD;
more difficulty in winning her."&#xD;
Come, Ned, that is too bad ! You ought&#xD;
to be banished from the oaks, for com-&#xD;
paring the beautiful Carlie Dennison, to a&#xD;
Miss Nancy.~~&#xD;
"Of course! But seriously, I do not think&#xD;
Miss Carlie the equal, certainly not the&#xD;
superior, of Fanny Brenton, and here they&#xD;
both come, as if to afford us an opportunity&#xD;
of deciding~"&#xD;
General Dennison's stately grays swept&#xD;
along the banks of the river, and in the&#xD;
open barouche were seated Fanny and&#xD;
Carlie. As they approached the spot&#xD;
where the young gentlemen were standing&#xD;
with raised beavers, Miss Dennison ordered&#xD;
the coachman to stop. Maitland could not&#xD;
boast that his favourite had a richer blooiti&#xD;
upon her cheek, than mantled beneath the&#xD;
brilliant complexion of Fati ny Brenton.&#xD;
The countenances of both expressed undis-&#xD;
guised pleasure.&#xD;
"We are taking a drive this lovely after-&#xD;
noon," said Carlie; "here are two vacant&#xD;
seats, will you not occupy them 3"&#xD;
The horses dashed on with the merry&#xD;
party, winding along the stream for several&#xD;
miles, they at length ascended a lofty hill.&#xD;
"Shall we visit the Cave 3" inquired&#xD;
Maitland.&#xD;
"Willingly," replied Fanny, "if it is not&#xD;
too late"&#xD;
"But can we do so in thin dresses 3" in-&#xD;
quired her companion, as she cast a glance&#xD;
at the rich silks in~.w4si~~they were robed.&#xD;
"Oh yes, the way is not intricate."&#xD;
"Comethen. James, rest the horses&#xD;
here; we will soon return."&#xD;
They diverged from the road, and en-&#xD;
tered a narrow way, which led over the&#xD;
acclivity. Maitland and Miss Dennison&#xD;
preceded their companions.&#xD;
"Is he not fortunate to win the regard&#xD;
of such a girl 3" whispered Fanny.&#xD;
"Has he been so fortunate 3"&#xD;
"Do not tell him for the world. But I&#xD;
dare say, you are sufficiently skilled in the&#xD;
human heart to discover that Carlie is very&#xD;
much interested in the Southerner."&#xD;
"II can hardly form art opinrori of your&#xD;
sex, for to me, you are enigmas. Do you&#xD;
think Maitland reciprocates her attach-&#xD;
ment 3"&#xD;
"How is it possible for him not to do&#xD;

"Yes, it is doubtless so: see with what&#xD;

covere(I the earth. Tradition had gifted&#xD;
this water with magical powers. Not only&#xD;
were its properties medicinal, but whoever&#xD;
drank at the fountain would have their&#xD;
cherished hopes gratified.&#xD;
"Here is an antidote, Miss Brenton,"&#xD;
said Clifton, "for the imprecation of Nell&#xD;
Oakland."&#xD;
"As little importance should be at-&#xD;
tached to the reputation of one, as to the&#xD;
denunciations of the other," replied Fanny.&#xD;
Why, Fan, you are neither supersti-&#xD;
tious nor romantic; you must be heart-&#xD;
less."&#xD;
"Perhaps so."&#xD;
Taking the goblet from Clifton's hand,&#xD;
she quaffed its contents.&#xD;
The sun had descended beneath the&#xD;
horizon, and the moon was casting her&#xD;
mild beams along the earth, when they&#xD;
entered the carriage. The air was balmy&#xD;
and fragrant. Playing with the ringlets&#xD;
which had escaped from Fanny's hat, it&#xD;
lingered upon her cheek, and then gliding.&#xD;
on, revelled upon the neck and bosom of&#xD;
her lovely companion.&#xD;
Miss Brenton leaned back in the car-&#xD;
riage with folded arms, with one foot&#xD;
slightly elevated, and reposing upon a&#xD;
velvet ottoman. Carlie rested her cheek&#xD;
upon her ungloved hand, and looked pen-&#xD;
sively at the gathering shadows of night,&#xD;
as they pursued each other through the&#xD;
forest, All were too much agitated with&#xD;
their own emotions to interrupt the silence,&#xD;
until the mettled steeds had traversed&#xD;
several miles of the road homewards.&#xD;
"Do you look forward with pleasure to&#xD;
the day when you will graduate, Mr.&#xD;
Maitland ?" inquired Fanny.&#xD;
"Why should I? Already I am blessed&#xD;
with as much happiness a~ ever falls to&#xD;
the lot of mortals."&#xD;
"But then you will have obtained an&#xD;
education, and be exempt from restraint."&#xD;
"I doubt if a diploma will make me a&#xD;
freeman," and he cast a rapid but signifi-&#xD;
cant glance at Carlie, who was still lost in&#xD;
a reverie.&#xD;
"Of what advantage is the possession of&#xD;
knowledge ?" asked Edward; "the simple&#xD;
process of acquiring that which has been&#xD;
discovered by others. There is a vast dif-&#xD;
ferenc6 between the acquisition of know-&#xD;
ledge and the possession of a creative&#xD;
power, which elicits new ideas."&#xD;
"Butifyo ur ideas, although unknown&#xD;
to you, were promulgated centuries ago ?'~&#xD;
"Then~t isunfoitunate for my reputa-&#xD;

credit of originality, at least."&#xD;
The carriage drew up at the residence of&#xD;
General Dennison.&#xD;
"Will you not come in and take tea?&#xD;
No? Thea you must call soon, gentlemen.&#xD;
Fanny is now my guest."&#xD;
"What detained you so late, girls?" in-&#xD;
4uired Mrs. Dennison.&#xD;
"We have visited the Cave."&#xD;
"Who with, pray? not alone, I hope ?"&#xD;
"Ah, no; Mr. Maitland and Edward&#xD;
Clifton accompanied us."&#xD;
"Indee4 ! where did you pick them up ?"&#xD;
"They were taking an afternoon walk."&#xD;
"There wa~ no previous arrangement, 1&#xD;
trust ?"&#xD;
"How could you suppose so, ma?"&#xD;
'~Well, well, child! Did you pass a&#xD;
pleasant afternoon ?"&#xD;
"Delightful! we had an adventure,&#xD;
though, with Old Nell."&#xD;
"Is it possible! But tea is ready. Why&#xD;
did not your companions come in? you in-&#xD;
vited them I suppose ?"&#xD;
"Yes, but they declined."&#xD;
"Well, come. What of Nell ?"&#xD;

THE long-looked-for day at length, ar-&#xD;

were to graduate. The town was thronged&#xD;

class.&#xD;
Among the ladies who were assembled&#xD;
as the guests of Carlie Dennison, were her&#xD;

of that species of property, think you 3"&#xD;
"Oh, admirably. Bent you know I shall&#xD;
only pass my winters there. In the sum-&#xD;
mer we shall travel. Fanny, you have&#xD;
not seen Edward Clifton in six months.&#xD;
What is the condition of your relations&#xD;
with him 3"&#xD;
"Not warlike, and yet not very amicable.&#xD;
At the present time we are both preserv-&#xD;
ing a sort of armed neutrality."&#xD;
"Why is this so3I anticipated, at one&#xD;
time, a match between you."&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton is ambitious. A thirst for&#xD;
distinction absorbs every thought of his&#xD;
life."&#xD;
"He does possess transcendent powers.&#xD;
Maitland says there is not his equal in&#xD;
colleiie."&#xD;
"I understand he will graduate with the&#xD;
highest honours."&#xD;
"I think, Fanny, you construed intense&#xD;
application to his studies into coldness,&#xD;
and therefore treated him with too much&#xD;
haughtiness. Recollect, he is high-spirited&#xD;
as well as yourself. When you meet again,&#xD;
try and smooth that imperious brow of&#xD;
thine a little."&#xD;
"On the contrary, I think the proper&#xD;
way to subdue the gentleman, is to treat&#xD;
him with indifference, and as that course&#xD;
is consonant wit my feelings, I shall prac-&#xD;
tise it.'~&#xD;
"Have a care, my dear Fanny! Recollect,&#xD;
these quarrels are sorr~etimes irreconcil-&#xD;
able. Remember, the breach between&#xD;
Maitland and myself was healed in the&#xD;
very jaws of death."&#xD;
"But how know I that Clifton loves me 3&#xD;
He has never said so."&#xD;
"There are a thousand tokens by which&#xD;
a discerning woman can divine the feelings&#xD;
of the other sex."&#xD;
"Very well, Carlie; my feelings shall&#xD;
control me in this instance."&#xD;
Miss Dennison shook her head reprov-&#xD;
ingly, and left the apartment.&#xD;
A ball was given at the residence of&#xD;
General Dennison. The youth and beauty&#xD;
assembled at Andover thronged his capa-&#xD;
cious saloons, and at nine o'clock Clifton&#xD;
entered Maitland's room for the purpose&#xD;
of accompanying his friend to the scene&#xD;
of revelry.&#xD;
"Ned, yo~ are sa~ to-night," said the&#xD;
joyous Mississippian; "you, of all others,&#xD;
should be happy when your collegiate&#xD;
triumphs are lauded by every one."&#xD;
"And yet, Fred, I doubt if you would&#xD;
exchange positions with me-.eh 3"&#xD;
Maitland thought of Carhie Dennison.&#xD;
and expressed a decided negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am sad because I shall now be sepa-&#xD;
rated from those friends with whom I have&#xD;
passed so many pleasant hours at Andover."&#xD;
"Clifton, what are your plans for the&#xD;
future '~"&#xD;
"Within six months I shall depart for&#xD;
the Southern States, in some one of which&#xD;
I shall cast my lot."&#xD;
"1 am glad you have delayed your de-&#xD;
parture so long, for I must have you at my&#xD;
wedding."&#xD;
"Upon one condition,-that you will,&#xD;
previous to that event, pass several weeks&#xD;
with m at m father~s.~~&#xD;
"Very well, that is arranged."&#xD;
"Who are to be present to-night at the&#xD;
General's 3'~&#xD;
"All the people of note who reside in the&#xD;
village, besides the distinguished strangers&#xD;
who were down hither to attend the corn-&#xD;
mencement."&#xD;
"Has your fastidious taste discovered&#xD;
any young ladies of surpassing beauty 3"&#xD;
"None who can compare in loveliness&#xD;
with Carlie and Miss Brenton."&#xD;
"By the way, Fred, how much Fanny&#xD;
has changed in the last three years. Her&#xD;
stately bearing is not half so attractive as&#xD;
the charming naivete which she once pos-&#xD;
sessed."&#xD;
"You must recollect she is no~v nineteen&#xD;
years old, and a female at that age is quite&#xD;
as matured as a man at twenty-five."&#xD;
"Indeed; well then, as Carlie and Fanny&#xD;
are as old as we are, they must be six years&#xD;
ahead of us in experience and maturity.&#xD;
Your bride will have a fair start, Fred; I&#xD;
hope she may retain it."&#xD;
The young men entered the dwelling to-&#xD;
gether. The more youthful portion of the&#xD;
company were engaged in dancing, and&#xD;
among them Edward recognized Fanny&#xD;
Brenton. He returned her haughty salu-&#xD;
tation with a bow still more stately, and&#xD;
passing on, sought the hand of Carlie Den-&#xD;
nison for the next quadrille. It happened&#xD;
that French and Fanny were thus vis-a-&#xD;
vis. Turning her in the dance, he did not&#xD;
address a word to Miss Brenton, and when&#xD;
the quadrille was over he yielded his part-&#xD;
ner to Maitland, and sauntered through the&#xD;
rooms. Approaching a card-table, he saw&#xD;
Harriet Salisbury and Mary Holmes play-&#xD;
ing a game of whist with Kelborn ana&#xD;
another ~entleman. Harriet noticed his&#xD;
approach with a glad smile.&#xD;
Come, Mr. Clifton, sit down here and&#xD;
give me the benefit of your experience,"&#xD;
and she drew the ample folds of her satin&#xD;
dress nearer to her person. Edward occu-&#xD;
pied the vacant seat upon the sofa, and&#xD;
watched the progress of the game. While&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
Kelborn was dealing, Clifton remarked:&#xD;
"Life is little better than a game at cards&#xD;
Harriet."&#xD;
"How so, pray 3"&#xD;
"We are obliged to play our part~with1&#xD;
whatever powers we are gifted by our own&#xD;
destiny, and the only difference consists&#xD;
in the stake for which we throw. In this&#xD;
busy world the ambition of thousands is&#xD;
scarcely elevated above a game pf cards,&#xD;
while others, more restless, if not more&#xD;
wise, stake life, fortune, everything, upon&#xD;
the hazard of the die."&#xD;
"Have a care, Ned," said Kelborn, "or&#xD;
you will view human existence with the&#xD;
fatal vision of a misanthrupist.~~&#xD;
hidden' no; I have merely examined the&#xD;
springs which control the human&#xD;
race, for the purpose of knowing myself.~~&#xD;

Harriet of Clifton.&#xD;
"To-morrow."&#xD;
Will you not accompany me 3 Pa&#xD;

"XVith gre at pleasure. I will place my&#xD;

will you start 3"&#xD;
"After breakfast; I suppose about nine&#xD;
o'clock. I will send the carriage to your&#xD;
lodgings for you."&#xD;
"I shall consider it a great honour."&#xD;
The game was decided as supper was&#xD;
announced, and Kelborn, claiming the&#xD;
fulfilment of an engagement with Miss&#xD;
Salisbury, Edward offered his'arm to Mary&#xD;
Holmes, and they entered the supper-room.&#xD;
The table was loaded with every delicacy&#xD;
that could tempt the appetite of a gour-&#xD;
man d.&#xD;
"What shall I help you to, Mary 3"&#xD;
"Some oysters, if you please."&#xD;
"And some champagne 3"&#xD;
"Will it give me vivacity 3" said she&#xD;
archly; "you once fancied I was too se-&#xD;
date."&#xD;
"Oh that day has long since passed,"&#xD;
and his glance dwelt for a moment admi-&#xD;
ringly upon the brilliant eyes and snow-&#xD;
white shoulders.&#xD;
"They all tell me I have changed," re-&#xD;
sponded the maiden as she sipped the&#xD;
sparkling wine.&#xD;
"I wonder if Master George French had&#xD;
anything to do with the transition 3"&#xD;
"Hush !" sai~the maiden, shaking her&#xD;
taper finger threateningly; "how dare you&#xD;
be guilty of such audacity! But I have&#xD;
been informed that with your quiet, dig-&#xD;
nified manners you have the courage to&#xD;
say or do almost anything. Is it so 3" and&#xD;
&#xD;
she looked into the eyes of the student&#xD;
with a mirthful expression.&#xD;
"Who could have given me such a&#xD;
shocking character 3"&#xD;
"Why, that is your 'general reputation&#xD;
in the neighbourhood,' to employ a phrase&#xD;
which I have heard my lawyer uncle make&#xD;
use of."&#xD;
"Frightful! But tell me, Mary, h~w&#xD;
does George get on 3"&#xD;
"He don't get on at all," said the dam-&#xD;
sel innocently.&#xD;
"It surely cannot be his fault."&#xD;
"Certainly not; but I intend to take my&#xD;
own time."&#xD;
"And flirt as long as you please, of&#xD;
course."&#xD;
"Exactly so. I have the reputation,&#xD;
why should I not have the enjoyment 3"&#xD;
"Why, Mary, yu ought to be killed."&#xD;
"Indeed; you certainly will let me&#xD;
choose my own executioner."&#xD;
"Unquestionably.~ shall I tende, my&#xD;
own ~&#xD;
"Thank you, no. That individual must&#xD;
not deserve the fatal punishment himself&#xD;
still more than I."&#xD;
"Ha! ha !" laughed French, ~vho had&#xD;
just approached them&#xD;
"she had you there,&#xD;
The music again struck up, and waving&#xD;
her hand, Mary joined the dancers with&#xD;
George French.&#xD;
Standing with folded arms, Edward&#xD;
surveyed the floating forms of the waltzers&#xD;
as they whirled past. Once he observed&#xD;
the eyes of Fanny Brenton fixed upon him&#xD;
xvith an expression of unutterable tender-&#xD;
ness, but they were instantly withdrawn as&#xD;
she encountered his glance, and the pearly&#xD;
teeth impatiently pressed her ruby lips.&#xD;
An hour later he prepared to depart,&#xD;
and searching for Carlie Dennison without&#xD;
success, he at last entered the library.&#xD;
Before him was a graceful form, leaning&#xD;
pensively against the casement. He was&#xD;
not certain, but he thought he heard a sob,&#xD;
and fearful that he had invaded a spot&#xD;
where anguish had claimed a sanctuary,&#xD;
he prepared to retreat. His movements&#xD;
werh observed, however, and the lady&#xD;
startled from her recumbent attitude,&#xD;
.turned round, and Clifton found himself in&#xD;
the presence of Fanny Brenton. The re-&#xD;
collection of his meeting witl~ her ~n the&#xD;
stage, their excursion to M~unt Vista, the&#xD;
visit to the Cave, and the I thousand inci-&#xD;
dents which had served to bind them to-&#xD;
gether, now gushed upon his memory with&#xD;
overpowering force. Their eyes met, but&#xD;
the agitated girl could not restrain her&#xD;
emotion, and bursting into tears she wept&#xD;

passionately for several moments. Ed-&#xD;
ward advanced quickly to her side, and&#xD;
taking her hand, he encircled her flexible&#xD;
form with his arm.&#xD;
"Dear, dear, Fanny !"&#xD;
But the impetuous maiden no sooner&#xD;
heard the sound of his voice than she&#xD;
dashed the tears from her cheeks, and re-&#xD;
leasing herself from his embrace swept&#xD;
haughtily from the room.&#xD;
The following day was raw and cold,&#xD;
but Edward found the carriage of Mr. Sa-&#xD;
lisbury early at his door. Bidding adieu&#xD;
to his classmates, hnd exacting from Mait-&#xD;
land a renewal of his promise to visit him&#xD;
in a few weeks, he was soon at the resi-&#xD;
dence of General Dennison. There he&#xD;
found Harriet awaiting his arrival, sur-&#xD;
rounded by Carlie, Mary Holmes, and Kel-&#xD;
born. Edward looked in vain for Fanny;&#xD;
she did not make her appearance.&#xD;
"Ned, I envy you this jonrney,~~ said&#xD;
Kelborn, with a woeful countentnce.&#xD;
"Well done! who would have sup-&#xD;

at the departure of a fair ~&#xD;
"Alas! at that time I had not been led&#xD;

"Good-bye, girls! we meet again in a&#xD;

my father's, Mr. Kelborn ?" -&#xD;
"'Tis my fate; I cannot prevent it if I&#xD;
would, and I would not if I could."&#xD;
"Farewell, Mr. Clifton I" said Carlie.&#xD;
"Have you no message for Fanny ~"&#xD;
"None. I shall take good care of Fred&#xD;
until we meet agairt. And a certain Mr.&#xD;
French will, in due time, be restored to&#xD;
his bonds, if indeed he can escape froni&#xD;
them for a brief season."&#xD;
CC Now, Mr. Edward, no more of that,&#xD;
unless you would be vic~imize~ yourself."&#xD;
"Egad, I know nothing that would be&#xD;
more pleasant."&#xD;
"Adieu !" "Good-bye !" and the horses,&#xD;
becoming restive from the cold, gladly&#xD;
sped onwards. The windows of the car-&#xD;
riage were closed, to exclude the piercing&#xD;
air. Clifton flung himself upon the front&#xD;
seat, and for several miles both were si-&#xD;
lent. Memory was reviewing the events&#xD;
whic~ad transpiredsince they first trod&#xD;
the sITh ets of Andover. When we bid a&#xD;
final adieu to the spot where an elevated&#xD;
platform in the staircase of life has been&#xD;
attained, our thoughts dwell upon the past,&#xD;
not the future.&#xD;
As the horses slowly mounted a long&#xD;
hill which was raked by the north wind&#xD;
the cold became more intense. Edward&#xD;
seated himself upon the back seat by the&#xD;
&#xD;
side of his companion, and enveloped him-&#xD;
self in the soft and delicious furs. Bnt the&#xD;
silence was still unbroken, save by an oc-&#xD;
casional sigh. Were they caused by re-,&#xD;
collections of the past or dread of the fu-&#xD;
ture, or by emotions which the present&#xD;
sometimes elicits ~&#xD;

MILTON.&#xD;
A FEW days after the arrival of Mait-&#xD;
land at the residence of Mr. Clifton, Ed-&#xD;
ward and himself mounted their horses,&#xD;
and, armed with light fowling-pieces,&#xD;
started for an extensive forest, which en-&#xD;
compassed a beautiful sheet of 'water some&#xD;
ten miles distant. Having fastened their&#xD;
steeds to the branches of a beech, a short&#xD;
distance from the road, they entered the&#xD;
forest in different directions, after agreeing&#xD;
to meet at the foot of a lofty pine, which&#xD;
towered above the surrounding trees. In&#xD;
a few hours Clifton had killed three par-&#xD;
tridges and two gray squirrels, and at last,&#xD;
faint with hunger, he sought the place of&#xD;
meeting. The Mississippian had not ar-&#xD;
rived, and kindling a fire against the trunk&#xD;
of a fallen maple, he prepared to cook his&#xD;
game. This was soon accomplished, and&#xD;
the savory fragrance of the viands min-&#xD;
gled with the perfume of the woods.&#xD;
Upon such occasions he always carried&#xD;
with him bread and sa1t~ and with the aid&#xD;
of these articles he made a delicious meal.&#xD;
Placing near the fire a bountiful supply&#xD;
for his companion, he reclined against the&#xD;
roots of the pine, and being much fatigued,&#xD;
soon fell into a profound sleep. How long&#xD;
he slumbered he knew not, but he was at&#xD;
length awakened by a heavy peal of&#xD;
thunder, and starting to his feet he disco-&#xD;
vered that rain was descending in torrents.&#xD;
He shouted Maitland's name, but the&#xD;
howling tempest only responded. He now&#xD;
prepared to return to the spot where they&#xD;
had tied their horses, but the increasing&#xD;
darkness rendered his progress slow and&#xD;
difficult. It was impossible to tell in what&#xD;
direction to proceed. The sun had de-&#xD;
scended beneath the trees, and heavy&#xD;
masses of clouds overhung the earth. It&#xD;
was only by the assistance of the continu-&#xD;
&#xD;
ous fl~hes of lightning that Edward conic&#xD;
make his way, and at length he was con&#xD;
scions of being hopelessly lost. He wan&#xD;
dered on, not knowing in what direction&#xD;
he was proceeding, when his footsteps&#xD;
were arrested by a low wailing cry, as ii&#xD;
utteie(l by a child in distress. Advancing&#xD;
towards the spot from whence the sound&#xD;
proceeded, he soon hoard the dashing ol&#xD;
waves upon the beach. In a fe~w mo-&#xD;
ments he stood upon the shore of the lake,&#xD;
and endeavored, as the lightning gleamed&#xD;
upon the water, to discover the object of&#xD;
his solicitude. The tempest raged with&#xD;
the most fearful violence, and lashing the&#xD;
waves with a white foam, drove them mad-&#xD;
ly upon jhe beach. For several minutes&#xD;
Clifton It ened with the most painful anx-&#xD;
iety, but no sound met his ear except the&#xD;
howling of the storm. At last he heard a&#xD;
shout for aid, but this time in the loud and&#xD;
distinct tones of a man. Glancing eagerly&#xD;
along the raging flood, he discovered a&#xD;
boat floating bottom-upwards, about a&#xD;
dozen rods from the shore. It was evi1&#xD;
dent that whoever clung to the treacherous~&#xD;
bark were in imminent danger of being&#xD;
driven by the gale against a perpendicular&#xD;
rock, which towered from the water to&#xD;
the distance of twenty feet.&#xD;
No time was to be lost, and Edward&#xD;
instantly ~)lunging into the lake, breasted&#xD;
the waves with a stout heart and a strong&#xD;
arm. The calls for assistance coming&#xD;
more and more faintly across the water,&#xD;
assured him that the sufferers were sur-&#xD;
rounded by extraordinary perils.&#xD;
As he dashed alongside the boat the&#xD;
voice of a man exclaimed, "Thank God,&#xD;
you are saved !" Edward saw him sus-&#xD;
taining the form of a young girl with great&#xD;
difficulty.&#xD;
CC Preserve the life of my sister, and&#xD;
heaven reward you ~ said1a faint voice.&#xD;
Courage, man ~ replied Edward&#xD;
cling to the boat, and I will soon return."&#xD;
Throwing one arm around the form of&#xD;
the unconscious young lady, Clifton soon&#xD;
reached the shore, and bore her to a place&#xD;
of safety. He was in the act of entering&#xD;
the water again, when his steps were ar-&#xD;
rested by a plunge into the lake, and dur-&#xD;
ing the next flash of lightning, he disco-&#xD;
vered the form of a man parting the waves&#xD;
with powerful strokes, in the direction of&#xD;
the sufferer.&#xD;
"'Tis lVlaitland, undoubtedly," thought&#xD;
Edward, and he directed his attention to&#xD;
the maiden. Enclosing her slight form&#xD;
in the coat which he hadth rown off before&#xD;
entering the water, he rested her head upon&#xD;
his shoulder, and anxiously awaited her&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
restoration to consciousness. She had lost&#xD;
her hat while in the water the comb had&#xD;
I escaped from her hair, aid in long and&#xD;
(lishevelled tresses, it hung around her&#xD;
shoulders and extended nearly to her feet.&#xD;
Her countenance was pale, and a purple&#xD;
hue gathered upon her eyelids, and colour-&#xD;
ed her lips. In the centre of the cheek the&#xD;
warm blood soon began to return, and at&#xD;
length she opened her eyes of softest blue.&#xD;
"Brother, we are saved !"&#xD;
As she spoke she discovered teeth of&#xD;
the most brilliant whiteness, and her sweet&#xD;
breath played upon his cheeks.&#xD;
"You are indeed preserved, and your&#xD;
brother also will snort be in safety. See, he&#xD;
is already near the shore."&#xD;
The young girl discovering that she re-&#xD;
posed in the arms of a stranger, at once&#xD;
regained her feet, while the pale hue of&#xD;
her complexion vanished before the blush&#xD;
which mantled her cheeks. Gazing for a&#xD;
moment upon her deliverer, and conscious&#xD;
how much she was indebted to him, she ad-&#xD;
vanced, and extending her hand, express-&#xD;
ed her thanks with much grace and feel-&#xD;
ing, for the aid which he had rendered&#xD;
her.&#xD;
In the mean time Maitland and the&#xD;
stranger reached the shore and advanced&#xD;
towards them.&#xD;
"You have saved our lives , gentlemen;&#xD;
for, without your assistance, we should&#xD;
have been inevitably lost."&#xD;
"Speak of it no more, said Edward;&#xD;
"we only obeyed the prompting of hu-&#xD;
manity. But how came you in such a&#xD;
forlorn situation ?'&#xD;
"We left the hotel yonder, a few hours&#xD;
ago, for the purpose of taking a sail, when&#xD;
the sky became suddenly overcast with&#xD;
clouds, and a squall striking our frail&#xD;
hark, we were precipitated into the water?'&#xD;
"'Twas unfortunate. But your sister, as&#xD;
well as yourself, should no longer be ex-&#xD;
posed to this storm, drenched as your gar-&#xD;
ments are," said Clifton.&#xD;
"You must accompany us, then, to the&#xD;
hotel. I can furnish you both with a&#xD;
change of apparel.'&#xD;
"You proceed ~vith them," observed&#xD;
Maitland. "I will lead the horses; they&#xD;
are hard by."&#xD;
They had all changed their garments,&#xD;
and were seated at the supper-table. The&#xD;
maiden had recovered from her alarm,&#xD;
and her face was radiant with smiles.&#xD;
Clifton thought he had never beheld so&#xD;
lovely a being.&#xD;
"Bitt how did it happen that you came&#xD;
so opportunely to our relief ~" she inquired.&#xD;
"We were hunting in the forest. I first&#xD;

50                            CLII&#xD;
fell asleep, and then lost myself. Mait-&#xD;
land lost himself too, I suppose, for he did&#xD;
not keep an appointment which he made&#xD;
with me."&#xD;
"Then your misfortunes were the cause&#xD;
of our rescue V'&#xD;
"Undoubtedly. ~.t was merely accidental&#xD;
-perhaps I should say, providential-that&#xD;
I wandered in the direction of the lake.&#xD;
But whither did your peregrinations take&#xD;
you, Maitland ?"&#xD;
~C What, mine? I am almost ashamed to&#xD;
say. I traversed hill and dale for miles,&#xD;
bagging game as I went. I thought it&#xD;
strange, that the sun which shone from the&#xD;
opposite side of the lake in the morning,&#xD;
should still continue to cast hisraysdirectly&#xD;
across the water, until as he sunk beneath&#xD;
the tops of the trees, the lake was still&#xD;
between us. At lastreflecting upon the&#xD;
cause of this phenomenon, I ascertained&#xD;
that, whereas I was, in the morning, upon&#xD;
the northern shore of the lake, I was then&#xD;
upon the southern, and at the most .mode-&#xD;
rate calculation, a distance of six miles&#xD;
from the place of rendezvous."&#xD;
"Bravo! you would never do, for an&#xD;
Indian warrior."&#xD;
Mainland and the stranger, who had in-&#xD;
troduced himself as Mr. Howard, with-&#xD;
drew for the purpose of smoking cigars&#xD;
arid Clifton accompanied Alice Howard tc&#xD;
the parlour. Standing by the window, they&#xD;
looked out upon the water. The storm had&#xD;
abated, and the wind, which a few minutes&#xD;
before howled through the forest, and&#xD;
swept down the lake, now sighed through&#xD;
the leaves and fretted the surface of the&#xD;
water into little curling waves. The sky&#xD;
was unclouded, and the countless stan&#xD;
glittered in the firmament.&#xD;
The maiden gazed thoughtfully upon the&#xD;
scene. Edward supposed she could&#xD;
scarcely number fifteen summers; hei&#xD;
features were so child-like in their purity&#xD;
Her forehead was high, her eyebrows dan&#xD;
and beautifully arched; her eyes, large&#xD;
full and lustrous, caused the heart string~&#xD;
to quiver, with a strange happy sensation&#xD;
whenever they dwelt upon a person wh&#xD;
had elicited her regard.&#xD;
"What a ~ she observed, "be&#xD;
tween this lovely spot, and my own hoim&#xD;
in the city of Philadelphia."&#xD;
"And are you so much pleased wit]&#xD;
these wiltls ?"&#xD;
"Perfectly enchanted with their beauty&#xD;
It is fly first visit to the more northern&#xD;
States, an(l the objects which I have beheld&#xD;
more than realize my anticipations.~m&#xD;
"And what led you hither, so far fron&#xD;
tour residence? Surely, one so young&#xD;
&#xD;
51&#xD;
&#xD;
could not have been attracted by the&#xD;
romantic scenery ~&#xD;
"There is now a vacation at our school,&#xD;
and I accepted an invitation from my&#xD;
brother, to take a short excursion-which&#xD;
came near being a very longone;" and a&#xD;
shudder ran through her frame.&#xD;
"How long are we to be favoured with&#xD;
your presence ~&#xD;
"Onlyfora few days; ihe holidays have&#xD;
nearly expired."&#xD;
"And then you will return with any-&#xD;
thing but pleasant recollections of the&#xD;
rough treatment which you have received&#xD;
from our stormy elements."&#xD;
"I have no reason to be grateful to&#xD;
them; but to you, sir, for generously rescu-&#xD;
ing me from their fury: I shall always&#xD;
deem myself under the greatest obliga-&#xD;
"I pray you to forget them both. It&#xD;
would, to say the least of it, be ungallant&#xD;
to suffer one whQ had sought pleasure in&#xD;
our midst, to perish for want of assis-&#xD;
tance."&#xD;
They separated for the night, and each&#xD;
sought a friendly couch. For several&#xD;
hours the slumber of Alice was restless,&#xD;
* and disturbed. She thought they ~vere&#xD;
* again upon the lake; and dark masses of&#xD;
clouds, relieved here and there by white&#xD;
borders, rapidly moutited from the west.&#xD;
* Vivid lightning darted from the base of the&#xD;
cloud, and shot its forked tongue into the&#xD;
blue ether above: while the thunder which&#xD;
burst over their heads, rolled heavily&#xD;
away, until in the distance it produced a&#xD;
concussion that shook the foundation of&#xD;
'the earth. The wind, at first, came down&#xD;
the lake in faint blasts, but soon fell&#xD;
upon them with such force, that they were&#xD;
precipilated into the water; and then she&#xD;
I experienced the horrible perception of&#xD;
suffocation and death. She started up with&#xD;
a shriek! "Thank heaven, 'twas only a&#xD;
dream !" and smoothing her pillow, she&#xD;
turned upon her right side and slumbered&#xD;
again. But her imagination still fluttered&#xD;
upon the confines of oblivion. She was&#xD;
traversing a romantic grove, where water-&#xD;
falls soothed the senses; the breeze wafted&#xD;
- the fragrance of a thousand flowers, when&#xD;
a tall and manly form approached; raising&#xD;
her eyes, she encountered the admiring&#xD;
~ glance of Ed~vard Clifton. Together they&#xD;
wandered on, andshe drank in his pas-&#xD;
sionate declarations of love, until at length&#xD;
ri the~~ seemed to enter the realms of poetry,&#xD;
an the language of her companion be-&#xD;
came blended with music and flowers.&#xD;
~ The ideas which flitted across her imagine~&#xD;
, tion became more and more indistinct;&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
and she at last sunk into a calm and grate-  "Nonsense !"&#xD;
ful sleep.                              The next day "a horseman might have&#xD;
been seen" approaching the Lake House.&#xD;
Dismounting, cast the bridle to the&#xD;
hostler, and after giving instructioWs as to&#xD;
the care of his steed, he entered the par-&#xD;
lour. In answer to his inquiry for Miss&#xD;
CHAPTER xii.               Howard, he was informed that she had&#xD;
started that morning for Philadelphia.&#xD;
"There is a language by the virgin maste,  "But here is a letter for you, Mr. Clifton ~&#xD;

&#xD;
tension was soon absorbed by the masterly&#xD;
delineation of nharater. As the curtain&#xD;
fell upon the third ~t, he saw an unusual&#xD;
commotion in one of the private boxes.&#xD;
All the opera-glasses in the dress-circle&#xD;
were turned in that direction, and in a few&#xD;
moments it was whispered that a young&#xD;
lady had fainted.&#xD;
"I am not surprised," observed a maiden&#xD;
near Clifton. "I felt a sensation of suffoca-&#xD;
tion myself, during that scene." Ap-&#xD;
parently the lady had recovered, for order&#xD;
was restored in the box. Before his eyes&#xD;
were withdrawn, Alice Howard drew back&#xD;
the curtain, and leaning forward gave him&#xD;
a gracious bow. A glad smile played upon&#xD;
her lips, and the pale hue of her counte-&#xD;
nance, vanished before the deep carnation&#xD;
which coloured her cheeks. He returned&#xD;
her salutation with a cold, almost haughty,&#xD;
inclination of the head.&#xD;
"The cause of Miss Howard's swoon is&#xD;
now apparent," whispered a lady, gor-&#xD;
geously attired, to her companion. "This&#xD;
must be the gentleman who saved her from&#xD;
drowning ;" and she gave him a more de-&#xD;
liberate glance from her superb eyes.&#xD;
"Good-looking and distingu~, is he notV'&#xD;
The curtain again rolled up; but the play&#xD;
no longer arrested Edward's attention. His&#xD;
bosom was agitated by contending emo-&#xD;
tions. It was apparent, from her public re-&#xD;
cognition, that she was delighted to see him&#xD;
and he was not at all satisfied with him-&#xD;
self for returning her bow and smile so&#xD;
haughtily. She was now leaning back upon&#xD;
the sofa, and occasionally turned her eyes&#xD;
upon Clifton, with a sad, anxious expres-&#xD;
sion. And yet, ~vith a perverse, stubborn&#xD;
,obstinacy, which is sometimes as strange&#xD;
as it is uncontrollable, his brow still main-&#xD;
tained its gloomy fro~vn.&#xD;
The crowd began to disperse, and Clif-&#xD;
ton endeavored to make his egr&amp;amp;s from&#xD;
the theatre before Alice and her party, but&#xD;
the throng moved so slowly, that several&#xD;
minutes elapsed before he had gained the&#xD;
vestibule. There he saw Alice leaning~&#xD;
upon the arm of an elderly gentleman, an~&#xD;
looking eagerly among the audience, as&#xD;
they issued from the theatre. With a rapid&#xD;
step he was passing on, when quitting her&#xD;
companion, she advanced towards him,&#xD;
and laying her hand upon Clifton's arm,&#xD;
she said with a reproachful look, while the&#xD;
tears started to her eyes:&#xD;
"You s'ure4y do not wish to avoid me ~"&#xD;
"I was forced to believe from your con-&#xD;
duct since 1 last had the pleasure of see-&#xD;
ing you, that it was a matter of the pro-&#xD;
&#xD;
fondest indifference whether you ever&#xD;
saw me again.~)&#xD;
"This is too cruel: but I know you can-&#xD;
not thiuk so harshly of me&#xD;
"Papa, this is Mr. Clifton, of whom you&#xD;
have heard William and myself speak so&#xD;
often."&#xD;
"I am indeed glad to see you," said&#xD;
Mr. Jioward; "we shall all be pleased to&#xD;
extend the hospitalities of our house to you&#xD;
while you remain in Philadelphia; will&#xD;
you not dine with us to-morrow ~"&#xD;
"It was my intention to leave the city&#xD;
to-morro~v !"&#xD;
"Oh, that will aever do! Protract your&#xD;
visit. Shall it not be so&#xD;
The request was so powerfully seconded&#xD;
by the eloquent eyes of the maiden, that&#xD;
Edward consented. As he handed Alice&#xD;
into the carriage, he felt her hand tremble&#xD;
as he involuntarily pressed it. As he re-&#xD;
turned to the hotel, a thrill of joy agitated&#xD;
his breast. He had been convinced that&#xD;
Alice was not the cold, impassive being&#xD;
he had supposed.&#xD;
And what were the thoughts that pro-&#xD;
duced a wild commotion in the maiden's&#xD;
heart'~ A brief extract from her journal&#xD;
will show.&#xD;
"I have seen him, and how unex-&#xD;
pectedly! ~vhen my eyes fell upon his&#xD;
countenance, agitated as my feelings were&#xD;
by the play, it is not remarkable that I&#xD;
fainted. But what did Papa think ~ what&#xD;
did the audience think ~ for I saw all eyes&#xD;
turned upon me when I recovered, and his&#xD;
among the number. I could not forbear&#xD;
bowing; yet, his response was so cold.&#xD;
And then he wished to shun me; for what&#xD;
reason ~ Ah, it was my departure from the&#xD;
Lake House without leaving...a message,&#xD;
even, for him. It was unkind; I thought&#xD;
so, when it was too late! But the anguish&#xD;
which mother's illness produced; made me&#xD;
forget all; besides, I will explain it to him.&#xD;
And he dines here to-morrow; and if he&#xD;
should not become interested in mefor I&#xD;
am but a child! But then, if 1 was entirely&#xD;
indifferent to him, would he have noticed&#xD;
my conduct at the lake ~ No! no! I have&#xD;
heard it said, that we are only annoyed by&#xD;
the neglect of those for whom we enter-&#xD;
tain a high regard;" and with this idea&#xD;
floating in her imagination, she put away&#xD;
her journal, and was soon nestling in her&#xD;
soft~ fragrant bed, dreaming of unexpected&#xD;
meetings, and happy reconciliations.&#xD;

THE hour arrived when Clifton was to&#xD;
meet the How~rds, and entering a large&#xD;
and elegant dwelling in the most fashiona-&#xD;
ble part of the city, he was ushered by a&#xD;
livened servant into a parlour gorgeously&#xD;
furnished. He had scarcely surveyed the&#xD;
painltingsby the old masters which deco-&#xD;
rated the walls, when the door opened, and&#xD;
Alice Howard advanced to meet him. She&#xD;
was simply attired in a silk plaid, with a&#xD;
lace cape over her shoulders. Her luxu-&#xD;
riant hair, parted in the centre of the fore-&#xD;
head, was drawn hack so as to disclose&#xD;
her small and beautifully formed ears, and&#xD;
then wreathed into a French twist upon&#xD;
the back part of the head. She wore a&#xD;
solitary ring upon her taper finger, in the&#xD;
centre of which sparkled a magnificent&#xD;
diamond. Her tiny feet, Clifton did not&#xD;
fail to observe, were encased in well-fitting&#xD;
boots.&#xD;
Advancing frankly io our hero, she ex-&#xD;
tended her hand, and expressed the plea-&#xD;
sure which his presence in the city gave&#xD;
her. He had responded to her welcome,&#xD;
when the door was opened, and Mr. and&#xD;
Mrs. Howard entered. After being intro-&#xD;
duced to the latter, dinner was announced.&#xD;
"You must accompany Alice to the&#xD;
opera to-night, Mr. Clifton, if you have no&#xD;
other engagement," said Mr. Howard. "I&#xD;
have secured seats for you, my dear, near&#xD;
the Glendowers; you must introduce your&#xD;
friend to them. You will have the kind-&#xD;
ness to excuse tnyself and Mrs. Howard,&#xD;
and as it is within an hour of the time&#xD;
when the curtain rises, you can take a cup&#xD;
of tea with Alice before your departure."&#xD;
Clifton and the yorng lady returned to&#xD;
the panlour.&#xD;
"your arrival in Philadelphia occa-&#xD;
sioned me much surprise.~~&#xD;
"Yet I contemplated making a visit to&#xD;
the city long before I met you at the lake."&#xD;
"You did not tell me so."&#xD;
"I had not the pleasure of conversing&#xD;
with you then, more than an hour, as you&#xD;
may remember."&#xD;
"Yes, we were summoned home by the&#xD;
illness of my mother, and I fear our hur-&#xD;
ried departure was the cause of my being&#xD;
considered ungrateful, if not unfeeling;"&#xD;
and she timidly raised her eyes to his face.&#xD;
&#xD;
to rue opera or ~ucrezia ilorgia, which we&#xD;
shall hear to-night."&#xD;
Seating herself at the instrument she&#xD;
skilfully ran her fingers over the keys, and&#xD;
then sung, with a soft and melodious&#xD;
voice, those lines,&#xD;
' Thou hast wounded the spirit that loved thee."&#xD;
She did not wait to hear the expressions&#xD;
of delight which awaited the conclusion of&#xD;
the song, but darted up stairs for the opera&#xD;
cloak and hood.&#xD;
"It is time to go~now; the carriage is&#xD;
at the door. Here, you may hold my&#xD;
cloak and fan, while I put on my gloves.&#xD;
That will not detain me long," she con-&#xD;
tiuued, innocently: "as I find it impossible&#xD;
to purchase number sixes at any store in&#xD;
the city. I shall have to order some from&#xD;

"Why that is a glove for a child)'&#xD;
~CWell, you do not consider me any-&#xD;
thing more," and she smiled archly..&#xD;
"If not, you are a precocious one.&#xD;
"Come, now, I nra ready.~)&#xD;
He placed the ermine-trimmed opera-&#xD;
cloak upon her graceful shoulders, and&#xD;
they entered the carriage.&#xD;
The spirited horses dashed along the&#xD;
gay streets, which were thronged ~vith pe-&#xD;
destrians. Clifton glanced at the shop&#xD;
windows, where the costliest fabrics were&#xD;
exhibited in the brilliant gas-light. His&#xD;
eyes then wandered to the people who&#xD;
crowded the side-walk. There the rags of&#xD;
squalid poverty touched the rich dress of&#xD;
the lady, and the labourer, in his course&#xD;
garb, hurried past the gentleman of lei-&#xD;
sure.&#xD;
"Such is life !~' muttered Clifton, as the,&#xD;
carriage stopped in front of the theatre, for&#xD;
they did pot boast of an opera-house.&#xD;
w~' ~ have no objection, Mr Clifton&#xD;
walk home, as the night is&#xD;
sant."                          plea-&#xD;
"Gladly."&#xD;
"You need not return, then, Thomas."&#xD;
"No, Miss."&#xD;
In a moment they were in the midst of&#xD;
the crowd, and wete softly conveyed on in&#xD;
the press of brocades. Clifton found him-&#xD;
self surrounded by a bevy of beautiful&#xD;
women, splendidly robed. They were seat-&#xD;

ed by the box-keeper, and Edward had&#xD;
scarcely time to observe that the audience&#xD;
were eyen more aorreousl attired&#xD;
~    y       than&#xD;
the preceding night, when the grand music&#xD;
of Lucrezia Borgia burst upon his ear. It&#xD;
was the first opera he had ever heard, and&#xD;
he listened to it as though his soul was&#xD;
absorbed by the melody.&#xD;
The first a~t was over.&#xD;
"How '~xquisitely Mrs. Overton is&#xD;
dressed to-night !" whispered Clara Glen-&#xD;
dower to Alice.&#xD;
"The materials arq expensive, but do&#xD;
you not think the dress is slightly too low&#xD;
i~ the neck ?"&#xD;
"Oh, no! not a shade below the new&#xD;
style, if; indeed, it comes quite up to it."&#xD;
Clifton thought that down to it would be&#xD;
a more correct expression, but he did not&#xD;
say so.&#xD;
"I am glad to see it is becoming fa-&#xD;
shionable to attend the opera without hats:&#xD;
it is vastly more comfortable."&#xD;
'' You may well say that, Alice, with&#xD;
your superb head of hair: but suppose&#xD;
you had no more than that horrid little&#xD;
twist of Miss ~ V'&#xD;
"Could I not wear a braid ?"&#xD;
"But that looks so common; just ob-&#xD;
serve the back of Miss McKiernan' s head;&#xD;
is it Rot shocking?"&#xD;
"They have a way., now, of twisting a&#xD;
roll of false hair into their own, so as, ap-&#xD;
parently, to increase the quantity."&#xD;
"Yes, but the quality is not improved;&#xD;
besides, that does not enable them to coil&#xD;
the hair into so many circles. And then,&#xD;
how would a bride feel when she re-&#xD;
moved a large roll of false hair, and let the&#xD;
gro~m gaze upon her scanty locks ?"&#xD;
"Why what must they do ?"&#xD;
"Do nothing; only cultivate with the&#xD;
greatest possible care the covering which&#xD;
nature has placed upon their heads."&#xD;
"Should not ladies, who like yourself&#xD;
and Miss Howard, have magnificent hair,&#xD;
be thankful for the blessing?"&#xD;
"Of course we should." And the lady&#xD;
curved her aristocratic neck and suffered&#xD;
Edward to obtain a glance at the folds of&#xD;
jet black which ornamented her head.&#xD;
The second act commenced, conversa-&#xD;
tion was arrested, and a profound silence&#xD;
reigned among the audience, save when&#xD;
it was broken by the contact of kid gloves,&#xD;
as some high note was attained, and tri-&#xD;
umphant held, by the Prima Donna. The&#xD;
curtain fell a second time, amidst the most&#xD;
enthusiastic applause.&#xD;
"Alice, let us visit the Drennans, in the&#xD;
private box yonder. You know them."&#xD;
"Very 'veil."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Mr. Clifton, will you escort us&#xD;
"Certainly with oreat pleasure."&#xD;
The gracel~ul Philadelphian, raising her&#xD;
brocade, ostensibly for the purpose of&#xD;
keeping the dnst from its hem, preceded&#xD;
Alice and Clifton along the aisle, until&#xD;
they had gained the balcony.&#xD;
"I know you will like the Drennans,"&#xD;
said Miss Glendower to Edward. "They&#xD;
arc of the New York aristocracy."&#xD;
"What is the date of their patent of re-&#xD;
spectability ?"&#xD;
"Oh, several generations back. They&#xD;
occupy a position many degrees above&#xD;
those very clever persons who, having re-&#xD;
cently acquired large fortunes, make a&#xD;
grand display, vainly supposing that silver&#xD;
mountings. and a livened coachman, will&#xD;
be construed into evidence of either good&#xD;
breeding or&#xD;
Miss Glendower tapped with her fan up-&#xD;
on the door, and they were ushered into&#xD;
the box. Clifton was introduced to Miss&#xD;
Drennan and Mrs. Rutland, her sister.&#xD;
The married lady was a blond. Her dress&#xD;
was cut in the extreme of fashion, and&#xD;
disclosed her ivory shoulders and round&#xD;
throat.&#xD;
"How are you pleased with the opera,&#xD;
Mr. Clifton ?" she asked, resting her dim-&#xD;
pled elbow upon the ottoman, arid leaning&#xD;
graciously to~vards him.&#xD;
"To my untutored ear the singing seems&#xD;
divine,~~ he responded.&#xD;
~bThe Prima Donna is in very good&#xD;
voice, although she occasionally sings&#xD;
falsely. The Tenor is frightful. How&#xD;
they can tolerate him I do not understand,&#xD;
I am certain a New York audience would&#xD;
not."&#xD;
As Mrs. Rutland regarded the judgment&#xD;
of the Manhattanese infallible in musical&#xD;
criticism she considered the unfortunate&#xD;
wight wAo had attempted ~he part of Gen-&#xD;
naro, as effectually disposed of.&#xD;
Miss Glendo~ver curled her lip at this&#xD;
covert announcement of superiority, but&#xD;
she continued her conversation with Mr.&#xD;
Drennan. At length, turning to Mrs. Rut-&#xD;
land, she observed, "You were in rap-&#xD;
Aures with the Baritone who was engaged&#xD;
last winter at the New York Opera-&#xD;
House."&#xD;
"Yes, he was a great favourite."&#xD;
"Well, would you believe it? When I&#xD;
was in London last summer, he was con-&#xD;
sidered a fourth-rate artist. How utter-&#xD;
ly deficient in musical taste they must&#xD;
be in that city!" and there was the&#xD;
slightest possible approach to a derisive&#xD;
smile upon the lip of the Philadelphian.&#xD;
But sh~ had misjudged the estimation&#xD;
&#xD;
which Mrs. Rutland placed upon the&#xD;
oj5inion of New Yorkers. No shade of&#xD;
surprise or chagrin was visible upon her&#xD;
countenance, and she replied, with a natu-&#xD;
ral and slightly patronizing tone of voice,&#xD;
".He will be better appreciated when he&#xD;
returns to Europe. We think him an&#xD;
artist of the highest rank. Have you&#xD;
attended the opera in New York, Mr.&#xD;
Clifton? No! You have been unfortu-&#xD;
nate. ~ such a dear, dtarming place!&#xD;
One never meets vulgar people there."&#xD;
"I like the plan which has been adopt-&#xD;
ed of securing boxes or sofas for the sea-&#xD;
~ said Alice; "it appears more home-&#xD;
like, and then acquaintances can occupy&#xD;
contiguous seats."&#xD;
"That would be hardly a fair distribu-&#xD;
tion, provided your circle comprised the&#xD;
youth and beauty of the audience. It&#xD;
would exhibit the same want of harmony&#xD;
as placing the rarest flowers together in&#xD;
a bouquet, instead of distributing them&#xD;
artistically."&#xD;
"There is another reason, Mr. Clifton,"&#xD;
observed Mrs. Rutland; "ladies attend the&#xD;
opera in full dress, and, although they ~vil1&#xD;
bear close inspection, still the tout ensemble&#xD;
presents a grander appearance where space&#xD;
lends its enchantment."&#xD;
"Do you observe Miss Sutherland and&#xD;
her beau ?" inquired Miss Glendower.&#xD;
"The lady with auburn locks and spark-&#xD;
ling black eyes?"&#xD;
"Yes. Is it not strange that such a&#xD;
superb creature should engage herself to&#xD;
such a snip?"&#xD;
"But then she has been in society seve-&#xD;
ral years, and he is rich."&#xD;
" I think the stock of beaux now on&#xD;
hand, are, without exception, the most&#xD;
forlorn creatures 1 ever ~ said Miss&#xD;
Drennan.&#xD;
"That is emphatically the case with&#xD;
your New York beaux," replied Miss&#xD;
Glendower. "I saw an assemblage of&#xD;
them at a party last winter, and there was&#xD;
not one among them who would come up&#xD;
to Napoleon's standard for a dragoon.&#xD;
Every one would have been forced to&#xD;
join the infantry. The only evidefice of&#xD;
manhood which I could discover was their&#xD;
dress, and a thin, downy mustache,&#xD;
scarcely more than you will see on the&#xD;
lip of ~n Italian woman."&#xD;
"But they dance the polka gracefully."&#xD;
"True~ and they can do - nothing&#xD;
else!"'&#xD;
"Did you witness the tableaux at the&#xD;
Morton's, last week, Miss Howard 'i" in-&#xD;
quired Mr. Drennan.&#xD;
"No; I was unavoidably absent."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yonder sits the lady who personated&#xD;
Mary, Queen of Scots. Is ~he not a glori-&#xD;
ous creature ?"&#xD;
"Who is she? I never saw her before."&#xD;
"Miss Ruthven, from Baltimore."&#xD;
"How did she dress the character?"&#xD;
"Faultlessly. If the queen possessed&#xD;
such expressive eyes, pouting lips, fault-&#xD;
less bust, and flexible waist, it is not&#xD;
strange that a Douglass should have for-&#xD;
gotten his duty and deserted his post."&#xD;
"Why, brother, you are enraptured&#xD;
with the fair Bahiinorean."&#xD;
"And who is not? Observe the bloom&#xD;
upon her cheek; its hues are more exqui-&#xD;
sitely blended than the colouys of the&#xD;
peach. Her arm is cast in nature's hap-&#xD;
piest mould; and see those eyes, half con-&#xD;
cealed by the drooping lids. She looks this&#xD;
~vay ;" and the gentleman bowed profound-&#xD;
ly to the graceful inclination of the maiden.&#xD;
"You know her, then ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I was introduced with many&#xD;
other gentlemen, but I feared she would&#xD;
forget me in the mass who were pre-&#xD;
sented."&#xD;
"You should not fail to remember that&#xD;
the language of admiration is not confined&#xD;
to the lips. Our sex can with unerring&#xD;
certainty read it in your eyes."&#xD;
"Why should that make her recollect&#xD;
me&#xD;
"You. have not yet to learn, I hope,&#xD;
that admiration is grateful to a lady.&#xD;
Doubtless your Baltimorean discovered&#xD;
with the power of intuition, that she had&#xD;
made an impression upon you, and there-&#xD;
fore the countenance~ as well as the name,&#xD;
of Mr. Drennan, was remembered; that is,&#xD;
if the name was not in~listinctly muttered,&#xD;
according to the fashion of the times."&#xD;
"And to that circumstance I am to attri-&#xD;
bute the bow."&#xD;
"Not exclusively, perhaps; your re-&#xD;
spectable features and really very fine per-&#xD;
son might have had some influence. Be-&#xD;
sides, 1 may be pardoned for saying, you&#xD;
are surrounded, my dear brother, by a&#xD;
party somewhat remarkable for their dis-&#xD;
tingu6 appearance."&#xD;
"Do list en to this young fellow in the&#xD;
adjoining box. If he has declared once,&#xD;
he has a dozen times, his preference for&#xD;
melo-dramas. The only distinctive ideas&#xD;
he seems to possess are connected with&#xD;
melo-dramas."&#xD;
"You forget, Miss Glendower, that cer-&#xD;
tain persons of mediocre intellect, having&#xD;
once conquered an idea, cling to it with the&#xD;
utmost tenacity, and constantly refer to it&#xD;
in set phrases. Your neighbour is one of a&#xD;
thousand."&#xD;

Fhe opera was over, and Alice and her&#xD;
~mpanion were threading the streets in&#xD;
the direction of her home. Their progress&#xD;
was slow, for she was listening to the&#xD;
deep tones of his voice.&#xD;
"This is the house," said she, as they&#xD;
ascended the white marble steps.&#xD;
CC What, so soon&#xD;
"Will you not come in'?"&#xD;
"Not to-night." He almost regretted&#xD;
his refusal when he beheld the cheerful&#xD;
fire in the parlour~grate, and saw two large&#xD;
green velvet chairs reposing side by side1&#xD;
as if inviting a tete-a-tete. -&#xD;
"Shall I not see you to-morrow'?"&#xD;
"Certainly; I will call in the evening."&#xD;
"Good-night, then." The door closed&#xD;
as he descended the steps, and he was&#xD;
shut out from the warm parlour, velvet&#xD;
chairs, and the lovely creature who had&#xD;
been his companion or so many hours.&#xD;

Thn next morning Edward was accost-&#xD;
ed by young Drennan, who invited him&#xD;
into his parlour.&#xD;
"How do you like the society of Phila-&#xD;
delphiaV' inquired Clifton.&#xD;
"Very much, indeed. There is an un-&#xD;
ostentatious refinement here, which does&#xD;
not universally prevail in New York.~&#xD;
"And 'yet, is it not strange that there&#xD;
should be such a contrast in two cities&#xD;
separated by so short a distance'?"&#xD;
"Not at all. There are an infinite num-&#xD;
ber of cosmopolitans in New York. It is&#xD;
a modern Babel. Dutch, English, Scotch,&#xD;
French, Italians, Mexicans, and Ameri-&#xD;
cans, are all congregated together; in fact,&#xD;
there is scarcely a country upon the globe&#xD;
that is without a representative. In a so-&#xD;
&#xD;
ciety composed of such heterogeneous ma-&#xD;
terialsyo u could not expect the preva-&#xD;
lence of universal ~&#xD;
"What is the position occupied by the&#xD;
foreign population'?"&#xD;
"Where they are permanently settled,&#xD;
it depends very much upon their Wealth,&#xD;
or intellectual endowments. The same&#xD;
remark will, to a certain degree, apply to&#xD;
the traveller, though titles are, perhaps,&#xD;
the readiest passport to the saloons of a&#xD;
set who claim to be the leaders of the&#xD;
ton."&#xD;
"Of what titles do you spe~Jk'?" ~'&#xD;
"Counts, Barons, Chevali&amp;amp;; anything&#xD;
under the rank of an Earl."&#xD;
"And ihese subjects of a crowned head,&#xD;
upon the strength of a paltry title, obtain&#xD;
admission to the society of America's&#xD;
peerless daughters'?"&#xD;
"Nothing more corn mon, my dear sir,&#xD;
than an alliance between the d daughter of&#xD;
a wealthy parvenu and one of these titled,&#xD;
but poverty-stricken foreigners, ~vho are&#xD;
generally as poor as church mice."&#xD;
"Impossible !"&#xD;
"True, I assure you. A match of that&#xD;
kind came off recently; the lovely, but&#xD;
ambitious bride, insisted upon a visit to&#xD;
Paris, for the purpose of beillg presented&#xD;
at Court. She was anxious to flourish in&#xD;
the blaze of royalty. It was rumored,&#xD;
alas, that she was more indebted to the&#xD;
American Minister for a gracious recep-&#xD;
tion) than to her titled but obscure hus-&#xD;
barld."&#xD;
"Did she remain abroad W&#xD;
"No; she preferred a moderate noto-&#xD;
riety here, to oblivion there."&#xD;
"What other objection have you to the&#xD;
society of your native city'?"&#xD;
"It is too frequently the case that per-&#xD;
sons who are forced to conceal a disho-&#xD;
nourable origin, are elevated by the magi-&#xD;
cal lever of wealth into the society of those&#xD;
who can boast a pure descent."&#xD;
"Surely these unfortunates are not to&#xD;
blame for aa event over which they have&#xD;
no&#xD;
"No; but here lies the difficulty. If&#xD;
the guilty parents were assured that dis-&#xD;
honour would be visited on their offspring,&#xD;
they would pause upon the threshold of&#xD;
crime; but as it is, if they possess wealth,&#xD;
the world seems to draw no distinction&#xD;
between the offshoots of guilt and the&#xD;
fruits of wedlock. As long as such a de~&#xD;
moralizing state of society exists, vice and&#xD;
virtue are at par.~~&#xD;
"Then you would have society ex-&#xD;
clude these contaminating beings from&#xD;
its circle'?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Unquestionably. It is a hard case for&#xD;
the sufl~rer, yet it is not the only instance&#xD;
where the sins of the parent are visited&#xD;
upon the children for many generations.&#xD;
It is one of those events which are con-&#xD;
trolled by an unavoidable necessity, when&#xD;
the good of the many demand the punish-&#xD;
ment of the few. A hundred instances&#xD;
could be cited where a community im-&#xD;
molates the few, to save the mass from&#xD;
a moral blight. What can be more con-&#xD;
taminating than the association of a young&#xD;
lady with the child of dishonour'? What&#xD;
are the impressions which will be made&#xD;
upon her plastic mind'? Why, that a&#xD;
diversion from the path of virtue is not&#xD;
unpardonable, provided the culprit is&#xD;
wealthy."&#xD;
"But the forbearance which you so much&#xD;
deprecate does not universally prevail in&#xD;
\ NewYork'?" There is another circle in&#xD;
New York society which is far more ex-&#xD;
clusive; where the possession of a gaudy&#xD;
equipage is not considered an indication&#xD;
of refinement, or regarded as an introduc-&#xD;
tion. There our sex are gentlemen, and&#xD;
the females are a realization of Bulwer's&#xD;
Katharine, in the 'Last of the Barons."'&#xD;
"What is the social position assigned&#xD;
by that class to learning'?"&#xD;
"A very high one. Take, for instance,&#xD;
fifty names I could mention, belonging to&#xD;
the Historical Society-the rank which&#xD;
they hold is enviable."&#xD;
"Then you have as many different&#xD;
circles a~ there are representatives of&#xD;
foreign nations'?"&#xD;
"Quite as many.~~&#xD;
"Which takes the lead in giving tone&#xD;
and direction to fashions ~&#xD;
"A half-dozen different sets aspire to&#xD;
that honour, each one avowing a superi-&#xD;
ority over the others."&#xD;
"Then you have no clique so immea-&#xD;
surably pre-eminent above all the rest as&#xD;
to force obedience to its mandates'?"&#xD;
"Not at all. An individual will attach&#xD;
himself to that circle which presents the&#xD;
greatest attraction. One will join a fac-&#xD;
tion which has acquired notoriety for its&#xD;
pompous exhibition of splendour; another&#xD;
prefers the society of persons who are dis-&#xD;
tinguished for their polished elegance of&#xD;
manners. The freedom from restraint&#xD;
which characterizes the latitude of Paris,&#xD;
attracts others to its set; while science,&#xD;
music, literature, and the arts, are not with-&#xD;

In the evening Edward was seated by&#xD;
the side of Alice. Tea was announced,&#xD;
and while they were at the table Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
Howard referred to the contemplated visit&#xD;
of Clifton to the Southern States. The&#xD;
abolition question w~s beginning to as-&#xD;
surne a threatening ~fispect at the North.&#xD;
There were daiiy-e~cessions to the ranks&#xD;
of the party, and it already had acquired&#xD;
a commanding influence, by holding the&#xD;
balance of power between the two great&#xD;
political sections. The abolitionists had,&#xD;
~vith consummate skill, determined to&#xD;
force unscrupulous politicians into their&#xD;
ranks, by making concessions to their fa-&#xD;
tal doctrines the price of success. If the&#xD;
Democrats refused to comply with their&#xD;
demands, the Whigs were elevated to&#xD;
power. That appeared so hard to those&#xD;
who longed for the spoils, that they began&#xD;
to think it would be good policy to outbid&#xD;
their old adversaries. The cunning abo-&#xD;
litionists put themselves up at auction, and&#xD;
with a grim smile witnessed the eagerness&#xD;
with which Whigs and Democrats tried to&#xD;
outbid each other. The unmistakable&#xD;
evidence of distrust that was visible upon&#xD;
their countenai~es as they entered the&#xD;
auction-room, was as laughable as the per-&#xD;
plexity with which they would receive&#xD;
the announcement of some enormous bid&#xD;
by their rivals, followed by a hurried con-&#xD;
sultation as to the policy of making a still&#xD;
greater sacrifice. Principles were aban-&#xD;
doned ,-and a disgraceful scramble for the&#xD;
spoils began to characterize the political&#xD;
contests in many of the Northern States.&#xD;
CC Are you really willing,~~ said Mr.&#xD;
Howard, ~C to cast yonr fortunes among&#xD;
persons who buy and sell human beings'?"&#xD;
"I do not perceive the slightest objection&#xD;
to doing so. Waiving the question of mo-&#xD;
ralitv, slavery exists, and probably will&#xD;
ali. ~ys prevail in the Southern States."&#xD;
"But then you should not encourage its&#xD;
continuance, by residing among slave-&#xD;
holders."&#xD;
"I am very far from believing that&#xD;
slavery is wrong in the abstract. Besides,&#xD;
the negroes are happier than the same race&#xD;
are here."&#xD;
"The owners of these slaves may ne-&#xD;
glect to provide for them a sufficient&#xD;
amount of clothing and ~&#xD;
"That is hardly probable. There are&#xD;
stringent laws in force, which compel the&#xD;
master to provide for the wants of his&#xD;
slave, even if he is not prompted to do so&#xD;
by interest, for any neglect might ~produce&#xD;
dIsease and death."&#xD;
"Any one who will glance at the con-&#xD;
dition of the coloured race among us," said&#xD;
Miss Howard, with some timidity, "must&#xD;
come to the conclusion that they are an&#xD;
inferior race. They are not allowed to&#xD;

ride, in the stages, they yield the side-&#xD;
walks to the whites, and in the perform-&#xD;
ance of the most menial offices, they drag&#xD;
out a wretched ~&#xD;
"But, then, my daughter, they are free."&#xD;
"What good does their freedom do&#xD;
them'?" she replied, with animation. "Are&#xD;
they not slaves to idleness and want'? doeq&#xD;
not the spectre of famine stare them in the&#xD;
face, and point, with its skeleton finger,&#xD;
to the sunken cheeks and ghastly forms of&#xD;
its victims V'&#xD;
"There is no necessity for the suffering&#xD;
which you describe. Industry will enable&#xD;
all to obtain food."&#xD;
"Ay, but they will not be industrious.&#xD;
There is the difficulty; they require a&#xD;
master to force them."&#xD;
"This is the language of one who has&#xD;
not a just appreciation of.the subject," re-&#xD;
plied Mr. Howard, gravely. "Our philanZ&#xD;
thropists have not devoted their attention&#xD;
so long to the condition of the slave without&#xD;
having obtained a knowledge of his real&#xD;
condition."&#xD;
"Your philanthropists might have been&#xD;
more usefully employed at home," ob-&#xD;
served Edward. "There is a vast amount&#xD;
of religious cant, at the present day, ~vhich&#xD;
would pass current under the name of&#xD;
hypocrisy.~~&#xD;
"In what respect, Mr. Clifton'?"&#xD;
"It is apparent in the outward garb of&#xD;
the Church. It is indicated by the exer-&#xD;
tions which each denomination makes to&#xD;
erect a temple of the Lord that shall sur-&#xD;
pass all others in magnificence, and it is&#xD;
carried even to the commission of fraud&#xD;
and deceit. Passing along one of the&#xD;
fashionable streets, the other day, I saw a&#xD;
church whose lofty dome pierced the skies.&#xD;
It was erected upon the corner of two tho-&#xD;
ropahfares. The end and si(le fronting the&#xD;
streets were of beautiful marble, while the&#xD;
other two, I discovered upon a close in-&#xD;
spection, were of brick, but painted to imi-&#xD;
tate the marble."&#xD;
"Papa, that is our church,~~ said ice,&#xD;
with an amused smile.&#xD;
"Yes, and I opposed the arrangement,&#xD;
but without success; that, however, does&#xD;
not change the condition of the slave,&#xD;
where~qnivering limbs and piercing' shrieks&#xD;
proclaim the supremacy of the&#xD;
"These are not infrequently fancy&#xD;
sketches, portrayed for the purpose of cx-&#xD;
siting sympathy, or arousing indignation.&#xD;
Here again the law protects the slave, and&#xD;
the owner is not permitted to treat with in-&#xD;
humanity, that species of property, without&#xD;
a cause. There must, of course, be sub-&#xD;
mission upon the part of the slave; that&#xD;
&#xD;
T 0 N.&#xD;
&#xD;
C LI]J&#xD;
&#xD;
necessarily results from the relation which&#xD;
exists between them; but the conduct of a&#xD;
master to his slave is controlled by a well-&#xD;
regulated public opinion."&#xD;
"Bnt you surely cannot justify the sale&#xD;
of members of the same family to different&#xD;
purchasers ~&#xD;
"That is the strongest argument which&#xD;
the opponents of slavery are able to ad-&#xD;
vance. Still, the anguish resulting from&#xD;
those sales cannot be more harrowing than&#xD;
the fruits of poverty that are daily wit-&#xD;
nessed in your populous city. Why is the&#xD;
mother induced to barter the future peace&#xD;
of her child for gold'? Why will she abso-&#xD;
lutely torture the form of her infant until it&#xD;
presents the horrible appearance of disso-&#xD;
lution'? Why will the fallen descend step&#xD;
by step, into the dark abyss of woe, until&#xD;
they shiver upon the cold damp stones,&#xD;
where poisonous vapours hang upon their&#xD;
matted locks, and their eyes are opened to&#xD;
the ghastly realities of a living tomb'? The&#xD;
gnawing, relentless craving for food. In&#xD;
the midst of plenty, starvation stalks&#xD;
abroad, because your philanthropists are&#xD;
attempting to alleviate the coiidition of the&#xD;
slave."&#xD;
"You will remember, though, that our&#xD;
black population are free."&#xD;
"Freedom without equality," said Alice.&#xD;
"A negro cannot vote unless he has a&#xD;
property qualification, the white man can.&#xD;
Why this distinction, if you would es-&#xD;
tabli~i the doctrine of equality'? I have&#xD;
seen an aged coloured woman breast~&#xD;
the raging elements, with nothing to s~hiel~&#xD;
her head from the pitiless storm. An&#xD;
omnibus stops at her side, picks up a&#xD;
strong, healthy man, in the full vigour of&#xD;
life, and then rolls onward, regardless of&#xD;
the wistful glance which the poor old free&#xD;
negro casts after it. We never saw an~&#xD;
thing so cruel as that when we were&#xD;
the South, papa. There the old negro&#xD;
would have been protected from the tem-&#xD;
pe5t.~~&#xD;
"These are necessary regulations which&#xD;
society cannot avoid establishing, owing&#xD;
to the difference of colour. But all the facts&#xD;
which you have both adduced cannot&#xD;
justify the sale and transfer of human&#xD;
beings, and, at all hazards, the shackles&#xD;
should be stricken from the slave, and he&#xD;
should walk the earth a bondman no&#xD;
longer.~~&#xD;
"It is' not always," rejoined Clifton,&#xD;
"that freedom produces happiness. What&#xD;
is the condition of your paupers, who&#xD;
scarcely obtain a subsistence'? Look at&#xD;
the objects of distress who sweep the&#xD;
crossings of the streets in New York, un-&#xD;
&#xD;
protected from the pitiless storm. How&#xD;
often do the philanthropic citiz~ts reward&#xD;
the labour which enables them to cross&#xD;
Broadway without soiling their opera&#xD;
boots'? Look at the horseless beggars&#xD;
who throng the corners of the streets, ex-&#xD;
posing the forms of tender infants to the&#xD;
blasts of winter, for the purpose of ex-&#xD;
citing compassion. How often do your&#xD;
moral and sympathetic millionaires relieve&#xD;
the gnawing of hunger, as they sweep&#xD;
past'? Visit the haunts of poverty and&#xD;
wretchedness, and gaze upon the hollow&#xD;
cheek and attenuated form, while starva-&#xD;
tion and crime have formed an alliance.&#xD;
Then tell me, if you can, with all these&#xD;
horrors staring you in the face, that slavery&#xD;
should be abolished at all hazards."&#xD;
It was with unconcealed rage that Mr.&#xD;
Howard listened to this bold avowal of&#xD;
Clifton's sentiments, and rising abruptly,&#xD;
he left the room. Before closing the&#xD;
door, he cast a reproachful glance at his&#xD;
daughter, who apologized to their guest for&#xD;
the heat which her sire had exhibited.&#xD;
The next day Edward received a visit&#xD;
from Mr. Howard, at the hotel.&#xD;
I hope you will not consider the re-&#xD;
quest I am about to make an ungracious&#xD;
one, Mr. Clifton. It is quite natural that&#xD;
my daughter should feel for you the most&#xD;
grateful emotions, from the service which&#xD;
you rendered her. She is young, perhaps&#xD;
susceptible, and I now must appeal to&#xD;
your honour as a gentleman, not to pursue&#xD;
any course, before your departure, calcu-&#xD;
lated to win her affections. She knows&#xD;
very little of the world, having mingled&#xD;
rarely in society, and four years must&#xD;
elapse before she will complete her educa-&#xD;
tion. Besides, there is an insurmountable&#xD;
objection to an alliance between yourself&#xD;
and Alice. You are about to settle in a&#xD;
slav~hplding State, and my daughter shall&#xD;
never associate with persons who traffic in&#xD;
human flesh. I must at least request you&#xD;
not to speak of love to her before your de-&#xD;
parture, and to refrain from writing to her&#xD;
for six years.~~&#xD;
"Although I have not avowed a prefer-&#xD;
ence for Miss Howard, yet I sincerely re-&#xD;
gret the announcement y on have made.&#xD;
To relieve your anxiety, I will pledge my&#xD;
word as yon desire. It is unnecessary&#xD;
however, or if your daughter had inspired&#xD;
me with~ the most unshaken attachment,&#xD;
I would have considered it dishonourable&#xD;
to win her regard, before maturity had en-&#xD;
abled her to draw a distinction between&#xD;
gratitude and love."&#xD;
"'Spoken like a gentleman, and a man&#xD;
of honour," said Mr. Howard, with much&#xD;
&#xD;
F'TON.                             59&#xD;
cordiality. He mused for a few moments,&#xD;
and then, shaking his head, he muttered,&#xD;
"Nono, it will neverdo! what would the&#xD;
society think of me'?"&#xD;
"To prove that I appreciate the gal-&#xD;
lantry and generosity which saved my&#xD;
child, I beg your acceptance of this trifle ;"&#xD;
and he. tendered to Edward a diamond&#xD;
ring of great value. Clifton drew himself&#xD;
up to his full height, and gazing sternly at&#xD;
the donorhereplied: "No, sir1 1 desire&#xD;
no reward for doing my duty, and I am&#xD;
still less inclined to barter my heart for a&#xD;
bauble."&#xD;
He sought Alice for the purpose of ob-&#xD;
taining a parting interview.&#xD;
"Do you depart so suddenly'?"&#xD;
"To-morrow."&#xD;
"And when do you return'?"&#xD;
"Perhaps never! ~he~ a young man&#xD;
once mingles with the crowd, in the eager&#xD;
strife for pre-eminence, it is impossible to&#xD;
tell whither the surges may bear him."&#xD;
"I regret your determination," observed&#xD;
the maiden sadly; "I shall often think of&#xD;
you !"&#xD;
"And shall I have a place in your&#xD;
memory'?"&#xD;
"Can you doubt it'?" she responded&#xD;
with ~&#xD;
Clifton almost regretted the promise he&#xD;
had made her father, and conscious of the&#xD;
danger, he rose abruptly to take his leave.&#xD;
Surprised at the suddenness of a sepai~ation&#xD;
for which she was not prepared, Alice cast&#xD;
a startled and bewildered look at our hero,&#xD;
while her hand played convulsively with&#xD;
her bodice. For a minute after the door&#xD;
closed upon his receding form, she stood&#xD;
as though transfixed to the spot, and then&#xD;
heaving a sigh, which proclaimed the&#xD;
agony of her feelings, she threw herself&#xD;
upon the sofa, and wept long and bitterly.&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
"The silent wilderness for me,&#xD;
where never sound is heard,&#xD;
Save the rustling of the squirrel's foot,&#xD;
And the Sitting wing of bird.&#xD;
Or its low and interrupted note,&#xD;
And the deer's quick, crackling tread,&#xD;
And the swaying of the forest boughs,&#xD;
As the wind moves over head."&#xD;
PEABODY.&#xD;
CLIFTON now proceeded to join Kelborn,&#xD;
who had retumed several days before to&#xD;
New York. He soon made preparations&#xD;
for a hunting and fishing excursion to the&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8086-00000025"/>&#xD;

wilds of the West. Several months had&#xD;
elapsed before they arrived at Milwaukie,&#xD;
and were read y to plunge into the vast&#xD;
solitudes which stretched westward to&#xD;
the Mississippi River. in 1834, the place&#xD;
where they made their head-quarters,&#xD;
could only boast one white female; now&#xD;
it numbered more than ten thousand in-&#xD;
habitants. The rapidity with which the&#xD;
forests have disappeared along that portion&#xD;
of Lake Michigan is little less than magical.&#xD;
A life of hardship and adventure presents&#xD;
no terrors to the American bordered.&#xD;
Nothing is to him so fascinating as a fron-&#xD;
tier life. Instances are by no means rare&#xD;
of tiLe frontiersman becoming disgusted&#xD;
with the restraints which society imposes,&#xD;
and although surrounded with the comforts&#xD;
and even elegancies of life, he renews his&#xD;
journey westward, until he treads once&#xD;
more the ternit&amp;amp;y of his savage neigh-&#xD;
bours. This love of adventure is extend-&#xD;
ing the area of freedom by opening new&#xD;
avenues for the rapidly increasing popula-&#xD;
tion of the United States.&#xD;
Few of the denizens of a cit~ have cor-&#xD;
rect views of border life. Wit ideas too&#xD;
much shaped by events which occur&#xD;
within a narrow circle, and with thoughts&#xD;
too often bounded by brick walls, they are&#xD;
ignorant that life upon the frontiers is&#xD;
surrounded with hardships and perils; and&#xD;
ye~ that, sprinkled with romantic incident&#xD;
leshene by genuine hospitality, it&#xD;
rarely fails to expand the intellectual&#xD;
powers, and to spiritualize the human&#xD;
heart. The prominent features of society&#xD;
upon the border, which at once arrest the&#xD;
attention of travellers, are hospitality, pa-&#xD;
tient industry, and dauntless courage.&#xD;
Clifton resolved to postpone his visit to&#xD;
the South, until he had mingled with the&#xD;
population otwhat were then the territories&#xD;
of Wisconsin and Iowa, and enjoyed the&#xD;
exciting amusements of the chase. Game&#xD;
could be found in great abundance, from&#xD;
Lake Michigan to the Falls of St. Anthony,&#xD;
and to that point he resolved to direct his&#xD;
course. He had already formed the ac-&#xD;
quaintance of Frank Blount, a hardy Ken-&#xD;
tuckian who willingly joined the party.&#xD;
They obtained the services of a coloured&#xD;
man as cook, and an Irishman fresh from&#xD;
the Emerald Isle, as a man-of-all-work.&#xD;
Each member of the party was mounted&#xD;
upon~a steed. Kelborn, Clifton, and Blount,&#xD;
were each armed with the long Western&#xD;
rifle: in addition to which, the two former&#xD;
*         had 'swung to their shoulders, double bar-&#xD;
relled guns, while the latter carried at his&#xD;
saddle-bow, a weapon which very much&#xD;
resembled the formidable battle-axe of&#xD;
&#xD;
the Crusaders. As neither Peter, the negro,&#xD;
nor Tom Sheridan, the Irishman, were&#xD;
skilled in the use of fire-arms, all the im-&#xD;
plements of death which were intrusted to&#xD;
their charge, were two long bowie-knives.&#xD;
It is true, that Peter appropriated the axe,&#xD;
with which he was accustomed, to obtain&#xD;
wood for their fires;\but Tom, declaring he&#xD;
would rival the CC nnger~~ in the qual4y of&#xD;
their weapons, cut a formidable shillalah.&#xD;
Two pack-horses were also purchased;&#xD;
upon one was placed salt, sugar, coffee,&#xD;
tea, and a small supply of cooking uten-&#xD;
sils, while upon the other was mounted&#xD;
two tents, and the requisite number of&#xD;
blankets. The addition of five hounds&#xD;
made up the train. For bread and pota-&#xD;
toes they intended to rely upon the white&#xD;
settlers, who were scattered' through the&#xD;
territory&#xD;
It was a bright morning in the mouth of&#xD;
May, that our party took their departure&#xD;
from the thriving village of Milwaukie,&#xD;
and plunged into the forest which extended&#xD;
to the westward. The sky was unclouded,&#xD;
and the rays of the morning sun were&#xD;
mirrored in the dew-drops which hung&#xD;
upon the leaves. The hun t~ rs felt that&#xD;
bounding of the heart and thrilling rush&#xD;
of the blood through the veins, which an&#xD;
abundance of oxygen, never fails to&#xD;
produce.&#xD;
"There is som ~thing peculiarly exhila-&#xD;
rating," said Kelbdrn, ~' in the atmosphere&#xD;
of these ~&#xD;
"True," responded Clifton "and it is&#xD;
always with much difficulty that I can re-&#xD;
strain myself from giving utterance to a&#xD;
shout, whenever I am beneath its dark&#xD;
foliage."&#xD;
"Well, wi~ can enjoy it now even to a sur-&#xD;
feit," replied Kelborn; CC and many moons&#xD;
shall be numbered before I again emerge&#xD;
from its depths."&#xD;
"It makes one ~ interposed&#xD;
Blount, "to think that these 'ore woods&#xD;
will soon be destroyed by The white man,&#xD;
who divides his time in fighting With&#xD;
~ the varmints, and the Ingins."&#xD;
"That shows the necessity for enjo~r ing&#xD;
these blessings while they last," said Ed-&#xD;
ward. "There are millions of acres over&#xD;
which the savage and the beast of prey&#xD;
alone roam, so that for several years the&#xD;
hunter will find amusement, before his&#xD;
sport is arrested by civilization."&#xD;
"Still the day will come, krter a while,"&#xD;
rejoined Blount, "when the rifle wilJ have&#xD;
to be laid aside; and where the bloody-&#xD;
minded Ingin roams in search of foQd, the&#xD;
white man will soon erect his log cabin,&#xD;
and improve his betterments"&#xD;

CC There is one abuse of the hunter's&#xD;
privilege, which most unquestionably calls&#xD;
for prompt attention. The buffalo, proba-&#xD;
bly the most splendid race of animals of&#xD;
which this continent can boast, is fast dis-&#xD;
appearing before the ruthless onslaught of&#xD;
the sportsman. Hunted from a mere&#xD;
wanton thirst for bloxl, and not to satisfy&#xD;
the wants of man, it cannot be hoped that&#xD;
they will long wander over the vast prairies&#xD;
of the West."&#xD;
CC Doubtless you would prove no more&#xD;
scrupulous yourself" said Kelborn, "if a&#xD;
herd of buffaloes should cross your path.&#xD;
What say you, Kentuck 'i"&#xD;
"There's truth for you," responded&#xD;
Blount. "He remain quiet in his saddle&#xD;
while a raging big bull-buffalo comes tear~&#xD;
ing along, for*all the world like a rumpagus&#xD;
devil! It is unreasonable to expect it."&#xD;
"Well, you will see," retorted Edward,&#xD;
"how often I shall raise my rifle against&#xD;
any denizens of the wilds, unless it be in&#xD;
self-defence, or to obtain a necessary&#xD;
supply of meat; and as at the present time&#xD;
our larder is well stockedI shall content&#xD;
myself with the amusements which this&#xD;
magnificent forest ~&#xD;
On the third morning after their de-&#xD;
parture from Milwaukie, the'y heard an&#xD;
exclamation of surprise from Peter.&#xD;
CC Gor-a-rnassa I what dat yoner ~&#xD;
The eyes of the party were quickly di-&#xD;
rected to the point in icated by the ex-&#xD;
cited black. It was discovered that a herd&#xD;
of deer were in the act of passing over a&#xD;
hill Which bounded the valley, about half&#xD;
a mile to their right. The view was not&#xD;
obscured by underbrush, and the advance&#xD;
of the hunters had been perceived by&#xD;
the deer, apparently, however, without&#xD;
creating any alarm. Blount and Kelborn&#xD;
at once determined to bring the game&#xD;
within reach of their rifles, and ClIfton,&#xD;
notwithstanding the humane doctrines he&#xD;
had so recently advocated, interposed no&#xD;
objectionsto t~ir plan. The Kentuckian,&#xD;
as the only e4 erienced wotiklman of the&#xD;
party, assumed the leadership. Rapidly&#xD;
surveying the ground, he discovered that&#xD;
the hills which bounded the valley upon&#xD;
either side, about one hundred rods in&#xD;
front, were only separated by a few yards,&#xD;
the glen at that p lace being contracted to a&#xD;
narrow defile. He supposed, if they could&#xD;
succeed in "heading" the herd, that they&#xD;
would cross the low ground ~ point,&#xD;
well knowing the animal preferred bound-&#xD;
ing along the ridges, in order to avoid the&#xD;
marshy soil, which w~ms often found at the&#xD;
foot of the hills. He therefore directed&#xD;
Kelborn to take a "stand" upon the brow&#xD;
&#xD;
of the hill, on the right, while Edward was&#xD;
requested to assume a position beyond the&#xD;
summit of the land on the left. Blount&#xD;
himself, calling the obedient hounds, re-&#xD;
traced his footsteps one-fourth of a mile,&#xD;
and was soon lost from their view. Clifton&#xD;
mechanically sought the spot which the&#xD;
Kentuckian had pointed out, and tying his&#xD;
horse in a thick grove of small timber, he&#xD;
listlessly seated himself at the foot of a&#xD;
gigantic oak. flow long he had remained&#xD;
in this position he knew not~ and being&#xD;
well aware that it was one of~ the hunts-&#xD;
~ rules never to desert a stand until&#xD;
requested to do so by the "driver," he&#xD;
suffered his thoughts to dwell upon the&#xD;
past, without caring for the present. His&#xD;
attention was at length arrested by the&#xD;
sound of a distant horn, as its shrill notes&#xD;
were echoed through the forest. Soon his&#xD;
ear caught the baying of the hounds, and&#xD;
he had scarcely risen to his feet, before he&#xD;
heard the sharp report of a rifle. Tho-&#xD;
roughly aroused, he prepared to attack the&#xD;
game, when he saw an antlered denizen&#xD;
of the forest rapidly descending a spur&#xD;
of the hill, directly towards him. The&#xD;
buck was closely followed by the hounds,&#xD;
and in their midst rode the daring Ken-&#xD;
tuckian, upon his splendid black charger.&#xD;
The rapid hounds of the deer, and the&#xD;
horse, as they thundered along, an(I the&#xD;
(Copening~~ of the dogs, proved too much for&#xD;
our hero's equanimity, and as they dashed&#xD;
past he discharged his rifle, but the&#xD;
game bounded on. Hurriedly mounting his&#xD;
steed, which could scarcely be controlled,&#xD;
so eager was he to follow the hounds,&#xD;
Edward joined in the pursuit. It was evi-&#xD;
(lent that Kelborn had desperately wounded&#xD;
the deerasthe leaves were stained with&#xD;
his blood; but still he held gallantly for-&#xD;
ward. The chase led over several hills,&#xD;
and at length approached the border of a&#xD;
narrow and rapid stream. The wounded (&#xD;
buck at once plunged down the bank, and&#xD;
attempted to cross the river, but the cur-&#xD;
rent proved too strong, and after struggling&#xD;
unavailingly for several minutes, his head&#xD;
turned down the stream, and for a few mo-&#xD;
ments he disappeared in the foaming&#xD;
rapids. The dogs, had also entered the&#xD;
water, and, with desperate resolution, pur-&#xD;
sued the game. The hunters had arrived&#xD;
upon the bank in time to see the buck&#xD;
emerge with great difficulty, upon a small&#xD;
islanA' ~.rhich divided.the river, and stagger&#xD;
into the bushe~r which covered it. Without&#xD;
waiting to discover whether the hounds&#xD;
would drive the deer from the island, Kel-&#xD;
born determined to follow them. Disre-&#xD;
garding the remonstrances of his com-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8086-00000026"/>&#xD;
62                            CLIf&#xD;
panions, he dismounted from his horse,&#xD;
and divesting himself of his coat, and&#xD;
laying aside his rifle, with no weapon but&#xD;
a bo~ie knife, he struck fearlessly ou$ into&#xD;
the stream. It required all the exertion of 1&#xD;
which his great muscular power was ca-&#xD;
pable, to prevent his being swept down&#xD;
the rapids. While Edward and the Ken-&#xD;
tuckian were anxiously watching his pro-&#xD;
gress, they were startled by the yelping of&#xD;
the hounds, as though they were furiously&#xD;
assaulted.&#xD;
"I like not these corn plaints of the&#xD;
critters," said Blount; " or alth ough.a&#xD;
buck will sometimes show grit when a&#xD;
bullet has reached a tender pint, still&#xD;
summit more than that deer, I fear me,&#xD;
makes Grundy-by the Lord! it is even&#xD;
as 1 said. See yonder," continued the ex-&#xD;
cited hunter, "away down at the lower&#xD;
end of the island."&#xD;
"I discover," replied Edward, "that&#xD;
the hounds have retreated into the river,&#xD;
but can see no reason for their doing so."&#xD;
"Do you not observe the dark gray&#xD;
animal which lies ready for a spring upon&#xD;
the dogs, if they return ~"&#xD;
"Trup true!" quickly responded Ed-&#xD;
ward; "but where is Kelborn ~ He is in&#xD;
danger from the catamount."&#xD;
"Yonder h~ goes; one motnent more&#xD;
and he will reach the head of the island,&#xD;
and it will be too late."&#xD;
The two hunters now raised their voices&#xD;
in warning shouts, but the roar of the&#xD;
water pre~ ented Kelborn from hearing&#xD;
what they uttered. Supposing from their&#xD;
gesticulations that they were pointing out&#xD;
the spot where the wounded buck was at&#xD;
bay, he at onc~ entered the thicket in&#xD;
pursuit.&#xD;
"The rash lad will be slaughtered by&#xD;
the wild cat," said the Kentuckian, earn-&#xD;
estly. "See ! the rumpagus varmint, after&#xD;
driving the cowardly hounds away, is re-&#xD;
turning to the deer. I callers did know&#xD;
that perfect reliance could only be placed&#xD;
upon a raci bull-dog."&#xD;
The anxious spectators now believed&#xD;
that the contest which they apPre~iended~&#xD;
would be over before either o them could&#xD;
reach the island' nevertheless, Clifton re-&#xD;
solved to fly to tue rescue of his friend. It&#xD;
was impossible to carry any fire-arms, and&#xD;
he was forced to\ rely upon a similar&#xD;
weapon to the one Kelborn had in his pos-&#xD;
session. Before he had measured half&#xD;
the distance fr6m the shore, Blount heard&#xD;
the screams of the wild-cat, and knew&#xD;
that she had attacked the adventurous&#xD;
hunter. Again nothing was heard but the&#xD;
&#xD;
T (J IN.                                                      CLIFTON.                       63&#xD;
&#xD;
roar of the falls, but the next minute the&#xD;
Kentuckian perceived the thicket was vio-&#xD;
lently agitated, and as it parted, he disco-&#xD;
vered~ Kelborn retreating, but defending&#xD;
himself with great desperation from the&#xD;
furious bounds of the savage beast. So&#xD;
rapid were the motions of the catamount,&#xD;
that she seemed constantly in the air. It&#xD;
was evident to the watchful Kentuckian,&#xD;
that both the combatants were wounded;&#xD;
still they fought with tile utmost ferocity.&#xD;
Each time the beast alighted upon the&#xD;
person of Kelborn, she was shaken off,&#xD;
and although the reeking blade drank&#xD;
blood at every thrust, it failed to reach a&#xD;
vital part, while his flesh was lacerated&#xD;
by her claws. Blount saw, with emotions&#xD;
of horror that the contest was becoming&#xD;
more an~ more une~jual. At each bound,&#xD;
it was evident the exasperated beast was&#xD;
repulsed with more difficulty. Edward&#xD;
was several rods from the island, although&#xD;
struggling nobly to aid his friend before it&#xD;
was too late. Twice had Blount drawn&#xD;
his rifle to his shoulder, but the rapid&#xD;
movements of the foes rendered it impos-&#xD;
sible to fire with safety. Clifton at length&#xD;
placed his fo~t upon the rocky shore of&#xD;
the island, an was in the act of dashing~&#xD;
forward to the relief of Kelborn, when he&#xD;
saw hint stagger back with the wild cat&#xD;
clinging to his breast. Scarcely had he&#xD;
reached the earth, and before Clifton could&#xD;
advance a single step, he saw the beast&#xD;
spring wildly from her prostrate foe, and&#xD;
falling into the stream, was borne unre-&#xD;
sistingly down the flood. The ndxt in-&#xD;
stant he heard the report of a rifle, atid&#xD;
casting his eyes to the shore, he saw a&#xD;
thin cloud of smoke slowly curling through&#xD;
the trees at the spot where the Kentuckian&#xD;
stood ,l meaning upon his weapon.&#xD;
Edward, leaning over the prostrate form&#xD;
of his friend, saw that he was severely in-&#xD;
jured. The skin upon his chest was, fur-&#xD;
rowed by the claws of the wild-cat; his&#xD;
arms were torn and blood~~ but the most&#xD;
dangerous wound was upo~' the left shoul-&#xD;
der, the muscles of which were laid bare,&#xD;
and from whence the tide of life was ra-&#xD;
pidly flowing. He at once proceeded to&#xD;
staunch the blood as much as possible,&#xD;
with the limited means in his possession.&#xD;
Duncan bore his sufferings with commen-&#xD;
dable fortitude, and greatly aided his inex-&#xD;
perienced friend by his suggestions.&#xD;
I Blount, in the mean time, had summoned&#xD;
their attendants to the bank of the river,&#xD;
and proceeding a short distance up the&#xD;
stream, they succeeded in crossing it ~vith-&#xD;
out difficulty. The Kentuckian discovered&#xD;
that the island was perfectly ~accessible&#xD;
&#xD;
from that side of the river, and in a fe~v&#xD;
minutes he joined his companions. The&#xD;
condition of Kelb~rn rendered it impossi-&#xD;
ble to proceed any further until he had&#xD;
recovered from his wounds, and Blount&#xD;
sought for a spot upon which their tents&#xD;
could be pitched. He discovered that the&#xD;
island was some twenty rods long, and&#xD;
about a dozen in width. In the centre 'vas&#xD;
a dry and level sot, surrounded on three&#xD;
sides by high rocks, having an open space&#xD;
in froni, leading to the shallow ford. The&#xD;
whole island was covered with a thick&#xD;
growth of fir, cedar, hemlock, and maple.&#xD;
Tom and Peter soon had the tents erected,&#xD;
and a comfortable bed of hemlock boughs&#xD;
prepared. Thither the wounded man was&#xD;
removed, and every effort was made to&#xD;
his sufferings. Tom was dis-&#xD;
patched in search of a favourable spot for&#xD;
the horses to forage, while Peter prepared&#xD;
to dress the deer. The exercise had given&#xD;
them all an appetite, and they keenly re-&#xD;
lished the delicious steaks which Peter&#xD;
broiled over the coals. Blount requested&#xD;
Duncan to eat nothing more substan-&#xD;
tial than soup, which he prepared with&#xD;
much culinary skill from a portion of the&#xD;
venison. Tom returned, after a short ab-&#xD;
serce, with the welcome intelligence that&#xD;
he had discovered a small prairie about&#xD;
one-third of a mile from the encampment.&#xD;
The horses were led to that point, and&#xD;
aftehbeing "hampered," were suffered to&#xD;
graze upon the luxuriant grass which co-&#xD;
vered the earth.&#xD;
" Your experience as a hunter, Duncan,~~&#xD;
said Edward, "has commenced under&#xD;
circumstances calculated to give you an&#xD;
unfavorable opinion of the amusement?'&#xD;
"Most certainly," resumed the other,&#xD;
"I cannot commend the reception which&#xD;
I have received upon the ground of jts hos-&#xD;
pitality."&#xD;
"It is what all count on ~ ob-&#xD;
served Blount, "who prefer the freedom&#xD;
of natur to the annoyances of pestiferous&#xD;
cities."&#xD;
"It surely is not often the hunter's fate&#xD;
to meet with so warm a reception as our&#xD;
friend received 'P' inquired Clifton.&#xD;
"It is rather uncommon; still, I have&#xD;
had a right smart chance of scrimmages&#xD;
~vith wild* varmints, as well as with out-&#xD;
laying Ingins. It won't do to calkerlate&#xD;
upon the marcy of either when they are&#xD;
bent on mischief."&#xD;
"At all events," said Duncan "I am&#xD;
indebted to the skill which you have ac-s&#xD;
quired in the forest for my life, as nothingg&#xD;
but the contents of that unerring rifle pre-&#xD;
&#xD;
vented the teeth of the catamount from in-&#xD;
flicting a mortal wound !"&#xD;
"I seed," replied the Kentuckian, "the&#xD;
game was well-nigh up with you-and as&#xD;
it was disarnable that the creter was more&#xD;
than ordinarily riled, I concluded it was&#xD;
time to let the peacemaker interfere.&#xD;
Still it was a splendiferous fight," conti-&#xD;
nued the animated forester, as his eyes lit&#xD;
up at the recollection of the combat, "and&#xD;
one that gave me an onaccountable desire&#xD;
to take a few bouts myself, were it not&#xD;
that even sich risky devils are entitled to&#xD;
fair play. Hows'ever, you showed the&#xD;
real grit, and may 1 be teetotally shivered&#xD;
if I don't stand by you in all emergencies&#xD;
for the futer."&#xD;
"I thank you, Blount, for your good&#xD;
opinion, ~s well as for youiiirnely as-&#xD;
sistance, 4 di shall always be grateful to&#xD;
Clifton and yourself. With two such men,&#xD;
I ~hall not fear to encounter all the horrors&#xD;
which the wilderness may present."&#xD;
While this conversation occurred in the&#xD;
tent, Peter and Tom were expressing their&#xD;
opinions of the fight.&#xD;
"It's my judgment, mister Pather, that&#xD;
the baste could have been asily managed&#xD;
wid the shillaleh."&#xD;
"No, ~ responded his sable corn-&#xD;
panion; "them sticks may do for one Irish-&#xD;
man to crack anoder's head wid ,but you'd&#xD;
better ~ a catamount aint gwine to&#xD;
pay no tensionn to them things; yah, yah,&#xD;
yah!"&#xD;
"Divil a bit do ye know about the wea-&#xD;
pons, at all, at all. Yees can't expect a&#xD;
nager, whose~skull is so thick that he can't&#xD;
fale the beauties of the shillaler&#xD;
cide upon its mints." u) to de-&#xD;
"You don't know nothing at all 'bout&#xD;

any fears ob your club! Ijishmens am&#xD;

"And be the powers, battle would they&#xD;

pace of ~&#xD;
The colloquy was terminated by the&#xD;
voice of the Kentuckian, who summoned&#xD;
the disputants to construct a foot-path&#xD;
across the ford. This was to be accom-&#xD;
plished byfelling an enormous oak over that&#xD;
part of the stream, the lower extremity of&#xD;
which was to rest upon the main land, and&#xD;
the top upon the island. Tom and Peter&#xD;
commenced the somewhat difficult task of&#xD;

cutting down the tree, not, however, with-&#xD;
out a contemptuous allusion upon the part&#xD;
of the latter personage to the indifferent&#xD;
manner with which the Irishman wielded&#xD;
his axe, and a somewhat decided expres-&#xD;
sion of opinion that "'them paddy's hab&#xD;
only sense nuff to use the spade and&#xD;
shovel."&#xD;
The oak that had for years towered in&#xD;
the wilderness, resisting storms and tem-&#xD;
pests, which had no other effect but to&#xD;
strengthen and enlarge its roots, now&#xD;
swayed to and fro, and at length came to&#xD;
the earth with a tremendous crash. After&#xD;
several limbs had been cut away, the trunk&#xD;
of. the oak afforded an excellent bridge,&#xD;
over which the hunters could pass with-&#xD;
out difficulty.&#xD;
The sun had now descended to the&#xD;
western horizon, and all further opera-&#xD;
tions were postponed until the next d~iy.&#xD;
Another excellent repast was served up by&#xD;
Peter. A stew was prepared out of veni-&#xD;
son; bread, and potatoes, seasoned with&#xD;
pepper and salt. Warm corn-meal cakes&#xD;
were made upon the griddle, while the&#xD;
savory tea was properly "drawn." Over&#xD;
this delicious meal plans were made for&#xD;
the succeeding day. Edward and Peter&#xD;
were detailed to catch fish, while Blount&#xD;
was to exhibit his skill with the rifle.&#xD;
After these arrangements were made, the&#xD;
whole party retired to rest and slept. sound-&#xD;
ly until morning.&#xD;
The sun had scarcely risen before the&#xD;
sportsmen left the tent. Blount crossed&#xD;
the bridge, and advanced into the forest&#xD;
which skirted the river, while our hero&#xD;
and Peter descended the stream to the&#xD;
foot of the falls, and commenced angling&#xD;
with a fly-hook. Clifton was exceedingly&#xD;
gratified to find that the river was filled&#xD;
with an illimitable, number of trout, the&#xD;
most beautiful and delicious of the finny&#xD;
tribe. The season was favourable for fish-&#xD;
ing with the fly-hook, and as the tempting&#xD;
but deceptive bait was thrown upon the&#xD;
water, it never failed to attract a ~hoal of&#xD;
the victims. When the sun had r~ched&#xD;
the meridian the anglers had filled their&#xD;
basket with trout. Returning to the camp,&#xD;
they found Blount already there, having&#xD;
bagged eight partridges, four wild turkeys,&#xD;
anil half-a-dozen fox.squirrels.* Peter's&#xD;
larder was therefore again well stocked.&#xD;
After having examined Duncan's wounds,&#xD;
which were found to be doing well, and&#xD;
partaken of a dinner which would have&#xD;
* This animal is somewhat larger than the com-&#xD;
mon gray squirrel, and Is yet to be found In the north-&#xD;
ern part of illinois.&#xD;
&#xD;
been acceptable to a gourmand, the Ken-&#xD;
tuckian informed the party that he had&#xD;
found a bee-tree about a mile from the&#xD;
island, and proposed that it should be cut&#xD;
down that afternoon. This proposition&#xD;
was gladly acceded to, and as no danger&#xD;
was apprehended from leaving Kelborn&#xD;
by himself, the rest of the hunters started&#xD;
in quest of the'~Foney. The Kentuckian&#xD;
easily found 'th&amp;amp; tree, which was a large&#xD;
and lofty hickory. The hollow through&#xD;
which the industrious little insects entered&#xD;
the body of the tree was about midway&#xD;
the trunk.&#xD;
As usual, the task of felling the tree de-&#xD;
volved upon Tom and Peter, for although&#xD;
Blount was more expert with the axe than&#xD;
the Irishman', h~ thought such menial du-&#xD;
ties unbecoming a forester. The hickory&#xD;
~vas soon prostrated by the vigorous blows&#xD;
of the two men, when the difficult and&#xD;
somewhat hazardous operation was to be&#xD;
performed of taking the honey from the&#xD;
tree. A fire was made of dried bark, and&#xD;
nearly all the heroic little insects were&#xD;
destroyed, while gallantly defending their&#xD;
treasures. Several of the bees, however,&#xD;
attacked Blount, whose swollen visage&#xD;
attested their powers. Peter did not es-&#xD;
cape with impunity, which called forth an&#xD;
expression of Tom's opinion that "it was&#xD;
not unrasonable the darlitit little birds&#xD;
should not take ony fancy to sich an on-&#xD;
christian countenance as Pather's; though&#xD;
by the holy saint Patrick, he should think&#xD;
they would quickly retreat when they&#xD;
wanst come fernenst his ugly visage !"&#xD;
When the hickory was sundered by the&#xD;
aid of wedges and a beetle, an immense&#xD;
quantity of honey was obtained. Recepta-&#xD;
cles had been already prepared from spruce&#xD;
bark, which was torn from that tree, and&#xD;
with a large store they returned to the&#xD;
camp. Peter now rejoiced over an abun-&#xD;
dance of everything his heart could. desire,&#xD;
and bountifully regaled the hunters with&#xD;
broiled partridges, roasted turkeys, fried&#xD;
trout, and baked potatoes, with any quan-&#xD;
tity of delicious honey, coffee and tea.&#xD;
The only regrets he gave utterance to was&#xD;
the want of milk, and eggs to settle the&#xD;
coffee. No one who has not enjoyed the&#xD;
delights of a camp in the forest, can at all&#xD;
appreciate the "pleasures of the palate"&#xD;
when the appetite is rendered doubjy&#xD;
keen by exercise, and a pure, bracing at-&#xD;
mosphere, which contains plenty of oxy-&#xD;
gen gas.&#xD;
The ~following morning, as Peter and&#xD;
Thomas Sheridan were passing through&#xD;
the woods in the direction of the little&#xD;
prairie, where. the horses were feeding,&#xD;
&#xD;
they saw running along before them a&#xD;
quadruped which is known by the appel-&#xD;
lation of pole-cat, but more commonly&#xD;
called a skunk. Tom was . delighted at&#xD;
beholding the animal, and exclaimed:&#xD;
"By the powers, Pather, yon is a baste&#xD;
we can surround, for he fatherr flies nor&#xD;
climbs up a tree, like a divil of a squirrel,&#xD;
and unless he can run across the bog faster&#xD;
than Tom Sheridan, we'll make him pris-&#xD;
oner."&#xD;
"Yah! yah! yah !" roared Peter, as he&#xD;
showed his ivory from ear to ear. "Mr.&#xD;
Eddard, him be delighted if you cotch dat&#xD;
speckuld feller."&#xD;
"Here goes, then, Pather; you head&#xD;
the crater ontil I can cut myself a decent&#xD;
shillelagh, whin I will be after making&#xD;
him fale its tender qualities."&#xD;
"You aint gwine to struck it, is you~"&#xD;
quickly interposed the African, who feared&#xD;
an abrupt termination of the sport. "Him&#xD;
uncommon tender, and you will kill him&#xD;
wid dat stick. Dat's no way to do, no&#xD;
how. Can't you put you hat over him,&#xD;
and cotch de feller after dat fashion ~&#xD;
Massa Eddard like to tame urn."&#xD;
"You have some sinse, after all, Pa-&#xD;
ther," said the now thoroughly excited&#xD;
Irishman. "Who would ha' thought a&#xD;
nager had so much rason. Yez ~ see,&#xD;
now, how decently Tom can do the&#xD;
work."&#xD;
Sheridan made a dash at the skunk, but&#xD;
he found the animal possessed more agi-&#xD;
lity than he supposed. After making&#xD;
several unsuccessful attempts to capture&#xD;
him Tom discovered that his ebony com-&#xD;
panion was affording no assistance; and,&#xD;
turning to express his indignation he saw&#xD;
Peter leaning against a tree, holAing one&#xD;
hand to his side, and stuffing his coat-tail&#xD;
into his mouth with the other.&#xD;
"What the divil do yez se~ to laugh at,&#xD;
you blathering spalpeen ~ Jist put your&#xD;
bog-trottex~ in motion, and turn the rather&#xD;
this way, or I'll make yez taste my shilla-&#xD;
lagh."&#xD;
After another desperate effort, in which&#xD;
he displayed all his activity, Tom suc-&#xD;
ceeded in thrusting his hat over the&#xD;
skunk; but the next instant he started&#xD;
back convulsively.&#xD;
"Be Jasus! what is the matter with the&#xD;
baste l" exclaimed the indignant Irish-&#xD;
man. "Pather.! Father !" But Peter&#xD;
was in no condition to respond; and&#xD;
when Tom gazed round in search of the&#xD;
negro, he saw him rolling upon the earth,&#xD;
and making the forest echo wit'h peal upon&#xD;
peal of the most boisterous merriment.&#xD;
The evolutions of the African partook of&#xD;
&#xD;
all the characteristic extravagance of his&#xD;
race. At one moment he rested his weight&#xD;
upon his head, and dangled his feet in the&#xD;
air, and anpn he rolled over and over&#xD;
again, ending in a somerset,' while each&#xD;
moment he gave utterance to yells of de-&#xD;
light.&#xD;
"If that hathenish imp' of the divil has&#xD;
not been playing a trick upon me !" ex-&#xD;
claimed the enraged son of the Emerald&#xD;
Isle, as he rushed towards him, with the&#xD;
evident intention of inflicting personal&#xD;
chastisement~ But aware of his danger,&#xD;
Peter started with all speed for the en-&#xD;
campment, making the, woods ring with&#xD;
laughter as he ran.&#xD;
Hard upon his footsteps followed Tom,&#xD;
uttering imprecations as he went.&#xD;
"I'll tach yez to trifle with the failings&#xD;
of a gentleman, you black-ball-you spal-&#xD;
peen-you imp of darkness!, Tell me&#xD;
again, will yez, to saze a rather whose&#xD;
brath is offensive to the nostrils 1"&#xD;
Thus the pursued and the pursuer en-&#xD;
tered the encampment, panting with fa-&#xD;
tigue, the negro still convulsed with merri-&#xD;
ment, and Tom overcome with passion.&#xD;
"How is this, my men l" said Clifton;&#xD;
"wherefore this haste V~&#xD;
"Hallo! Master Tom !" interrupted the&#xD;
Kentuckian. "You will keep the length&#xD;
of the peace-maker from me, if it is jist&#xD;
the same to you, until you git the par-&#xD;
fume of the skunk from them clothes of.&#xD;
yourn."&#xD;
"Is it a skunk yez call him ~ Thin, by&#xD;
me sowl, it's a d-d uncivil way he&#xD;
has of his own~- Sure, I was only trying&#xD;
to capture the divil in a quiet way, be-&#xD;
case Pather-bad luck to him-.-.-towld me&#xD;
Mr. £dward would be pleased to tame the&#xD;
baste. And so, you seez, I put me hat&#xD;
gintly over him, whin all at once I felt&#xD;
sich a smell! But sorry a bit of comfort&#xD;
do I git from ony of yez. It may be&#xD;
mighty amusing to the rest, but I am&#xD;
after thinking, if old Ireland's blessed&#xD;
saint had paid a visit to Ar~eriky, for the&#xD;
especial benefit of this same filthy animal,&#xD;
he would have deserved the thanks of all&#xD;
true Irishmen. Holy Virgin! how the&#xD;
scent sticks to me."&#xD;
It was fortunate for Sheridan that Kel-&#xD;
born's wounds were sufficiently severe to&#xD;
detain the party for several days at the&#xD;
island; thus giving him an opportunity of&#xD;
burying his clothes, until the scent could&#xD;
be partially removed.&#xD;
"I'll forgive yez this onst, Pather, for&#xD;
the murthering insult yez put on me, but&#xD;
upon me sowl, I'll saze the earliest oppor-&#xD;
tunity to cancel obligations."&#xD;
&#xD;

66                           CLIP&#xD;
"Werry well, Tom1 you may make the&#xD;
most you can out of Pete, onny you must&#xD;
conduct the warfare like a gemblem."&#xD;
Several days after this challenge had&#xD;
been tendered and accepted, Peter was&#xD;
suffering with the toothache and Tom&#xD;
informed him that he had been much&#xD;
afflicted in that way, but at last had found&#xD;
relief by chewing wild turnip; and pull&#xD;
ing a piece from his pocket, he tendered&#xD;
it to the black. Without hesitation, Peter&#xD;
put the turnip in his mouth and com-&#xD;
menced chewing it; but the next moment&#xD;
he exclaimed:&#xD;
"Gor a massa, Tom! you have poison-&#xD;
ed me!" A person affected with St. Vitus'&#xD;
dance never performed a greater number&#xD;
of evolutions than did the African; and at&#xD;
last, dashing for the river, he plunged his&#xD;
mouth into the water. This only added&#xD;
to his torture, and tears of agony coursed&#xD;
down his ebony cheeks, while Tom was&#xD;
giving vent to derisive laughter.&#xD;
"Yez xviii urge a gintleman to capture&#xD;
a skunk, will yez, and play a trick on a&#xD;
Christian white man l Arrah! that'll ba&#xD;
the last prank yez 'ill play on Tom, I'll ba&#xD;
bound."&#xD;
In a few weeks ~ wounds were&#xD;
sufficiently healed to enable him to mount&#xD;
his horse again, and the party resumed&#xD;
their progress towards the Falls of St.&#xD;
Anthony.&#xD;

Skin ahd 1~uft brought down."&#xD;
ScuiLtmn.&#xD;
PROCEEDING westward for two days,&#xD;
they had penetrated far into the interior&#xD;
of the wilderness. The surface of the&#xD;
land was undulating, and the soil exceed-&#xD;
ingly rich. The half-developed leaves gave&#xD;
the oak and hickory~the appearance of&#xD;
* being clothed in a demi toilette, and the&#xD;
air was perfumed by the blossoms which&#xD;
covered the trees. As far as the eye&#xD;
could penetrate the forest, it presented the&#xD;
appearance of a vast bouquet.&#xD;
They had been traversing a plain for&#xD;
several miles, which, but for a few stunt-&#xD;
ed trees here and there, would have been&#xD;
denominated a prairie. Diverging from&#xD;
the opening, they ascended a ridge that&#xD;
overlooked a stream upon their left. Sud-&#xD;
denly their progress was arrested by a&#xD;
&#xD;
TON.                                                      CLIFTON.                    67&#xD;
&#xD;
war-whoop which issued from the dense&#xD;
thicket that bordered the river, and echoed&#xD;
through the woods. They listened anx-&#xD;
iously for a minute, and then all eyes were&#xD;
turned upon the Kentuckian for an expla-&#xD;
nation. He uttered not a word, however,&#xD;
until the solitudes were again disturbed&#xD;
with the startling whJop.&#xD;
"What does it mean, Blount l" inquired&#xD;
Kelborn.&#xD;
"It would not be onaccountably&#xD;
strange,'~ replied the forester, "if them&#xD;
bloodthirsty Chippewas wer practysing&#xD;
ther cruelties upon some misfortpnate In-&#xD;
gin whose scalp they have sarcumvented."&#xD;
"Shall we not interfere," eagerly asked&#xD;
the other, "for the purpose of saving a&#xD;
human being from torture ~"&#xD;
"That bought be a dangerous bis-&#xD;
ness," observed Blount.&#xD;
"The Ojibwas have dug up the hatchet,&#xD;
and are now on the war path,~~ said Clif-&#xD;
tori; "at least, so I heard at the lake."&#xD;
And yet,~~ continued the Kentuckian,&#xD;
musingly, and apparently not heeding the&#xD;
remark of the last speaker, "and yet I&#xD;
have often received service from the Da-&#xD;
cotahs, when even peacemaker could not&#xD;
save me. And if it should prove that the&#xD;
Panther had filllen into the hands of the&#xD;
risky devils! Ah! now I remember me,&#xD;
the lad observed he wer agoin' to visit&#xD;
these hunting-grounds this moon. I tells&#xD;
you what," continued he, with great ear-&#xD;
nestness, "I summit believe the Ojibwas&#xD;
are nqw actively employed in infliction of&#xD;
justice, after the nianner of red-skins,&#xD;
upon a young Dacotah chief, who once&#xD;
saved my scalp xvhen it had been con-&#xD;
kered by the Chippewas. If you are not&#xD;
feared to take part in a risky scrimmage,&#xD;
we'll rescue the lad from their clutches."&#xD;
"Agreed !" cried the two young men&#xD;
simultaneously; "we will aid you with&#xD;
pleasure.~~&#xD;
"Egad! Clifton," continuedd Kelborn,&#xD;
"this looks like an adventure worth&#xD;
making a note of. I say, Blount, what&#xD;
shall we do '~. You are our captain in this&#xD;
affair, a position to which you are entitled&#xD;
from your experience in fighting Indians."&#xD;
"I will not deny that I have had some&#xD;
practyse in that way" modestly respond-&#xD;
ed the forester, "and the first order I must&#xD;
give is to preserve silence, or we may&#xD;
have the yelling varmints about us afore&#xD;
we are ready to receive ~&#xD;
The Kentuckian now issued his orders,&#xD;
with allthe dignity of a Brigadier. Tom&#xD;
and Peter were directed to lead the cavalry&#xD;
down the hill, in an opposite direction to&#xD;
the one from whence the war-whoop was&#xD;
&#xD;
heard, and to conceal them in the thicket&#xD;
at its base. He thea requested Edward&#xD;
and Kelborn to follow him, and the three&#xD;
hunters cautiously descended into the&#xD;
valley. After proceeding one-fourth of a&#xD;
mile along the border of the stream, and&#xD;
each moment hearing with more distinct-&#xD;
ness the tumult which prevailed in the&#xD;
encampment, they paused in the cover&#xD;
which a thicket afforded them, for the&#xD;
purpose of reconnoitering. Our adven-&#xD;
turers now ascertained that the war-xvhoop&#xD;
had been uttered, as B~lount supposed, by&#xD;
a party of eight Ojibwas, who were actu-&#xD;
ally putting to the torture, a young chief&#xD;
who was clad in the panoply of a Dacotah.&#xD;
The prisoner was bound to a tree, and his&#xD;
tormentors were hurling at his head the&#xD;
national weapon of the Indian warrior.&#xD;
The countenance of the victim w~is calm&#xD;
save when a contemptuous smile crossed&#xD;
his features, as a tomahawk pierced the&#xD;
bark of the tree some distance from his&#xD;
head. The precision with which one&#xD;
chief threw the fatal weapon, elicited&#xD;
shouts of approbation from the band. He&#xD;
was a tall and powerful savage, and each&#xD;
time he swung the glittering axe around&#xD;
his head, and hurled it from his brawny&#xD;
hand, it cut through the bark far into the&#xD;
oak, within half an inch of the Dacotah's&#xD;
temple. Having tested the bravery of the&#xD;
young chief they piled up the wood&#xD;
which had been gathered for the purpose&#xD;
of subjecting his nerves to the dread ordeal&#xD;
of fire. The smoke curled througJ~ the&#xD;
leaves, at first black and dense, and then as-&#xD;
suming a bluish tint, it revealed the blaze&#xD;
as it darted jts fiery tongue along the dry&#xD;
branches. ~he Chippewas joined in the&#xD;
war-dance around the helpless prisoner,&#xD;
and as the fire flashed upwards with every&#xD;
blast of wind, they made the arches of the&#xD;
forest ring wjth their hellish laughter.&#xD;
As our adventurers were in the act of&#xD;
discharging their rifles at the Ojibwas, the&#xD;
thicket was parted and the graceful form&#xD;
of an Indian girl darted to the side of the&#xD;
Dacotah.&#xD;
"Save him, oh save him !" she exclaim-&#xD;
ed, in the soft dialect of the tribe.&#xD;
"'Tis the Fawn, the affianced bride of&#xD;
Panther," whispered Blount.&#xD;
The girl was thrust aside, and the war-&#xD;
dance continued.&#xD;
We must act at once,~~ said Kelborn,&#xD;
"if we would save the youth from a terri-&#xD;
ble doom."&#xD;
"It is a risky undertaking," replied&#xD;
Blount; "but it must be ventured. We&#xD;
must fire at once, and then close."&#xD;
The word was given, and simultaneously&#xD;
&#xD;
the three rifles were discharged, and&#xD;
before the echo died away, the hunters&#xD;
rushed upon the startled foe. Edward and&#xD;
Kelborn had each killed his man, while&#xD;
the ball from Blount's rifle had disabled&#xD;
two. Still they were opposed by four&#xD;
stalwart savages, who, recovering from&#xD;
their momentary alarm, aud discovering&#xD;
that they still outnumbered their assailants,&#xD;
brandished their tomahawks, and uttering&#xD;
the war-whoop, advanced fiercely to the&#xD;
charge. In the mean time the flames&#xD;
were wreathing their fiery tongues around&#xD;
the form of the captive, and would have&#xD;
soon terminated his mortal career, had not&#xD;
the Fawn, seeing his perilous situation,&#xD;
darted forward, and with a knife which&#xD;
she took from her girdle, severed the cord&#xD;
which bound the young chief to the tree.&#xD;
The prisoner, snatching the weapon from&#xD;
her hand, sprung to the assistance of his&#xD;
deliverers. His presence was by no means&#xD;
inopportune. Blount and Kelborn were&#xD;
each engaged in a deadly conflict with a&#xD;
savage, while Edward was warding off&#xD;
with all the skill he possessed, the fierce&#xD;
attacks of two Chippewas. Uttering the&#xD;
war-cry of the Dacotahs, he advanced to&#xD;
the relief of th~f latter, and in a moment&#xD;
the combatants were equally divided.&#xD;
Blount, long accustomed ndian war-&#xD;
fare, xvas the most formida~e of~the foes.&#xD;
Protecting himself from the rapid strokes&#xD;
of the tomahawk with his rifle, he wield-&#xD;
ed his ponderous battle-axe with such&#xD;
effect that the savage soon fell lifeless at&#xD;
his feet. Kelborn had not been so fortu-&#xD;
nate 'the warrior whom he hact encoun-&#xD;
tered was of a gigantic frame. The Indian&#xD;
hurled his tomahawk, which grazed Kel-&#xD;
born's cheek. Poising his bowie-knife&#xD;
between his thumb and finger, a method&#xD;
of attack which practice had rendered&#xD;
skilful, he darted it full at the heart of the&#xD;
Chippewa. The savage was prepared,&#xD;
and leaped aside, the weapon struck a&#xD;
tree, and quivering there for a moment, it&#xD;
fell to the earth.&#xD;
Uttering a yell of triumph, the Indian&#xD;
drew a knife from his belt and sprang&#xD;
upon his victim. The latter, aware of his&#xD;
perilous situation, immediately closed&#xD;
with his antagonist. Seizing the uplifted&#xD;
arm of his foe, they glared at each other&#xD;
with looks of ferocity. The pause was&#xD;
but for a moment, when each exerted his&#xD;
vast strength for the purpose of acquirincr&#xD;
the mastery. Kelbom soon discovered~&#xD;
that the muscles of the savage were too&#xD;
powerful to be long resisted'? Before,&#xD;
however, he was entirely overcome, he&#xD;
saw the Indian girl spring eagerly for-&#xD;

ward, and seizing his bowie-knife, quicker&#xD;
than thought she placed the hilt in his&#xD;
grasp. Scarcely had his hand clutched&#xD;
the trusty weapon, when he saw Tom&#xD;
Sheridan corr~ing to the rescue, flourishing&#xD;
his favourite shillalah.&#xD;
"Be the powers! I'll teach yez the var-&#xD;
tues of this darlint bit of wood. Take that,&#xD;
and that," and' each time the solid hickory&#xD;
descended with crushing effect upon the&#xD;
naked head of the savage, with whom&#xD;
Kelborn was contending.&#xD;
"Whoop !" yelled the Irishman as he&#xD;
leaped into the air, and struck his heels&#xD;
twice together, "yez burn people, do yez?&#xD;
And is it the likes of ye that 'ill lay your&#xD;
black hands on a gentleman! Tom Sheri-~&#xD;
dan will tache you better manners." The&#xD;
rescue was timely, for Clifton found him-&#xD;
self opposed to a powerful savage, whose&#xD;
strength was greater than his own. Ward-&#xD;
irig off his blows, he was yet borne back,&#xD;
and the chief grasping him by the throat,&#xD;
was in the act of driving his knife to the&#xD;
heart of his foe, when the Irishman, with&#xD;
another flourish of his shillalah struck the&#xD;
warrior a tremendous blow acrc~ss the&#xD;
shoulders. Startled by an assault so un-&#xD;
usual, the chief turned upon his new&#xD;
assailant.&#xD;
"Come on, you spalpeen! here's the lad&#xD;
will be afiher trimming your hide for yez;&#xD;
you son of darkness !" The chief gazed&#xD;
for an instant with evident disgust, upon&#xD;
his vivacious opponent, and then ejacula-&#xD;
ting the word."' Hugh !" he attempted to&#xD;
drive his tomahawk into Sheridan's brain.&#xD;
But while the weapon was still in the air,&#xD;
the shillalah fell with such force, upon his&#xD;
arm that it dropped powerless at his side,&#xD;
and uttering an involuntary cry of pain1 he&#xD;
turned to fly; but the Irisbman was upon&#xD;
his footsteps, and before he could gain the&#xD;
shelter of the thicket, the hickory de-&#xD;
scended thrice upon the side of his head&#xD;
with such power, that the savage staggered&#xD;
like a drunken man, and the blood started&#xD;
from his severed ear.&#xD;
" Lay your hand on a gentleman, will&#xD;
yez? A paddy will team you better man-&#xD;
ners than that sante !" Tom attempted to&#xD;
renew the assault, but was balked; in&#xD;
his eagerness to overtake the fugitive, he&#xD;
stumb~'ed over the trunk of a fallen tree,&#xD;
and before he could regain his feet, the&#xD;
warrior had disappeared in the forest.&#xD;
"Bad luck to you, you prevented me&#xD;
from surrounding the devil !'~&#xD;
The rest of the Chippewas were now&#xD;
hors de combat, the Dacotah having tri-&#xD;
umphed over his antagonist. The young&#xD;
chief returned thanks in the language of&#xD;
&#xD;
the Dacotahs which was known to the&#xD;
Kentuckian.&#xD;
"Never mention it, lad. It is no more,&#xD;
arter all, than you have done fotme afore&#xD;
now. As for my companions here, I believe&#xD;
they were anxious for a scrimmage any&#xD;
way; besides, I owe these varmints a&#xD;
grudge."&#xD;
It was now mid-day, and returning to&#xD;
the spot where the horses had been con-&#xD;
cealed; the saddles were taken from them,&#xD;
and they were suffered to feed upon the&#xD;
grass, which covered the earth.&#xD;
"How came you in the tiles of the&#xD;
Ojibwas, Panther?&#xD;
"Me hunt wid my party when dey&#xD;
make prisoner of Fawn, and me try to take&#xD;
her, when dey catch me&#xD;
"You are not the first man who has got&#xD;
himself into a scrape by bein a beetle too&#xD;
fond of the fair 5CX~" responded the fores-&#xD;
ter; "but whar i~ the rest of your party V'&#xD;
"Ober do river."&#xD;
The conversation was interrupted by the&#xD;
noiseless approach of an Indian chief; from&#xD;
whose scanty attire the water still dripped.&#xD;
His chest heaved with quick respira-&#xD;
tion, proving that his progress had been&#xD;
rapid. The Panther cast an inquiring&#xD;
glance at the runner, but said nothing for&#xD;
a minute. At length he asked, in the&#xD;
dialect of his nation, what was the cause&#xD;
of his appearance.&#xD;
"The cowardly Chippewas are upon&#xD;
our trail !"&#xD;
"Their bodies are food for ~&#xD;
"No, they lie hid upon the other shore;&#xD;
they count so many~' andhe raised the&#xD;
thumbs and fingers of both hands twice.&#xD;
"Where are our men concealed i"&#xD;
"At the foot of yonder pine."&#xD;
"How many scalps do we number?"&#xD;
" ~ and he raised the fingers and&#xD;
thumbs of both hands.&#xD;
"The odds are too great; let me speak&#xD;
with the white chief;" and he related the&#xD;
condition of the two, parties to Blount,&#xD;
who had at that moment rejoined them.&#xD;
The forester listened attentively to the&#xD;
earnest language of the Dacotah, and after&#xD;
he concluded, he reflected for a moment,&#xD;
and then said: "I'll ask them. Do you&#xD;
see," continued he, addressing Clifton and&#xD;
Kelborn, "a party of rumpageous Ojibwas&#xD;
are' outlying yonder, for the purpose of&#xD;
circumventing the scalps of my friends,&#xD;
the Dacotahs. Shall we join the latter ?"&#xD;
"What think you, Edward? War exists&#xD;
between the United States and these Chip-&#xD;
p ewas; will it be any harm to take. a&#xD;
benefit on our own hook ?"&#xD;
"I suppose we may assist the Dacotahs,&#xD;
&#xD;
who are at peace with our government, te&#xD;
defend themselves !"&#xD;
"Whoop! spoken like a gallant gintle.&#xD;
man, as ye are," exclaimed the Irishman,&#xD;
as he flourished his shillalah. "Pather,&#xD;
what do yez think of that, you ace ol&#xD;
spades ?" The two chiefs looked surprised&#xD;
at this outburst, and turning their eyes&#xD;
upon the person addressed by Sheridan,&#xD;
they recoiled a step, and uttered the cus-&#xD;
tomary exclamation "Hugh !"&#xD;
"No wonder these half-clothed gintle-&#xD;
men are surprised with the likes of yez,&#xD;
Father. They might be after travelling&#xD;
a long time widout seeing sich a rum&#xD;
countenance. Wy didn't you take off yez&#xD;
hat to the chafes, and give them the binifit&#xD;
of seeing yez woolly head? Come up,&#xD;
man, and make your obasence."&#xD;
The Indians surveyed the African in&#xD;
utter amazement, and it was several&#xD;
minutes before they could withdraw their&#xD;
eyes from his ebony face.&#xD;
"Didn't I tell ye, Pather, that yez was&#xD;
born to create a sensation ?"&#xD;
In the mean time it was decided that&#xD;
the horses should remain under the charge&#xD;
of Peter, and the rest of the party should&#xD;
cross the river. As they advanced towards&#xD;
the banks of the stream, they passed the&#xD;
scene of their recent encounter, and Clif-&#xD;
~ blood curdled with horror, as he saw&#xD;
that three of the bodies were Madless.&#xD;
He had no opportunity of demanding an&#xD;
explanation, as they were swiftly and in&#xD;
silence approaching the river. The&#xD;
Panther led them a short distance along&#xD;
the bank where an oak had fallen over the&#xD;
stream. As they entered the thicket, they&#xD;
were surrounded by a band of twenty&#xD;
Ojibwas, who, uttering the fearful war-&#xD;
whoop, sprang upon the 'little band. Suc-&#xD;
cess against such odds was hopeless, and&#xD;
theKentuckian shouted, "Force a passage&#xD;
through the varmints !" All but Kelborn&#xD;
and Tom succeeded; the former was&#xD;
overpowered and bound by two savages;&#xD;
while the Irishman in attemptirjg to defend&#xD;
himself with his shillalah, rec~ved a blow&#xD;
on the head with a tomah~twk, which&#xD;
prostrated, him to the earth.&#xD;
"Quarter! enough !" shouted Tom, as&#xD;
the chief whom he had treated so roughly&#xD;
in the last encounter seized him by the&#xD;
hair, and drawing his knife, prepared to&#xD;
relieve him of his' scalp. "fladluckto&#xD;
yez, don't I tell ye I am satisfied ?" The&#xD;
exasperated warrior drew the sharp blade&#xD;
halfway around the head of his prisoner,&#xD;
when Sheridan sprang suddenly to his&#xD;
feet and exclaimed passionately, "And&#xD;
this is the game ye'll be after playing! strike&#xD;
&#xD;
an inimy when he is down and cries&#xD;
enough! Let that tache you the customs of&#xD;
the ring ;" and he struck the Indian in the&#xD;
face with such violence, that he fell&#xD;
heavily to the earth, and before he could&#xD;
regain his feet, th~ shillalah descended&#xD;
upon his head, crushing through his skull&#xD;
far into the brain. In a moment he was&#xD;
again overcome, and his arms were lashed&#xD;
to his side. His prowess had elicited re-&#xD;
sp ect, and some healing leaves were ap-&#xD;
plied to the wound up on his head, which&#xD;
was bleeding profusely~ after w&#xD;
was bound with admirable skill. hich, it'&#xD;
"These Indians are not so bad, after all,&#xD;
Master Kelborn, barren the tightness of&#xD;
their withs."&#xD;
"You do not know them, Pat! We are&#xD;
probably spared now, to be tortured here-&#xD;
after."&#xD;
"Tortured! what does that mane ~&#xD;
"I mean that we shall be burned, unless&#xD;
our companions rescue us.'&#xD;
"They surely would not be so ungin-&#xD;
tlemonly as to do that same."&#xD;
"Oh, they are ingenious in the art of&#xD;
torturing."&#xD;
Before Tom could reply to this com-&#xD;
fortable assurance, a stalwart savage com-&#xD;
manded silence.&#xD;
The shades of night now overspread&#xD;
the earth, and the vigilance of the two&#xD;
bands was awakened to prevent a surprise.&#xD;
They were only separated by a belt of&#xD;
hemlock and cedar, which bordered the&#xD;
stream. The Chippewas changed their&#xD;
position, by receding a short distance from&#xD;
the bank2 while the Dacotahs entered a&#xD;
dense thicket but a few rods from the&#xD;
river, indicated by the runner as the spot&#xD;
where the warriors were concealed. Sen-&#xD;
tinels were stationed by both parties, and&#xD;
the remainder threw themselves upon the&#xD;
earth, with their rifles resting ~upon their&#xD;
arms. The wind sighed mournfully&#xD;
through the branches of the piiie. Thin,&#xD;
white clouds obscured the dim starlight,&#xD;
and inky darkness settled upon the forest.&#xD;
Duncan Kelborn lay in the midst of his&#xD;
enemies, with his arms slightly bound.&#xD;
Apparently his captors trusted to their&#xD;
sleepless vigils to prevent his escape or&#xD;
rescue. As the shadows of night stole&#xD;
through the dark evergreens, he reflected&#xD;
upon the chances of escaping. The Irish-&#xD;
man was reclining by his side, with his&#xD;
arms also slightly bound, and Duncan, in&#xD;
a whisper, communicated his intentions&#xD;
to Sheridan. As it was necessary to post-&#xD;
pone this movement until sleep had over-&#xD;
powered the faculties of the Ojibwas, they&#xD;
rested as well as they could in their con-&#xD;

fined positions. The prospect of Indian&#xD;
tortures kept them both awake until long&#xD;
after midnight, when ~e forms around&#xD;
them presented that axed appearance&#xD;
~vhich indicates deep slumber. The clouds&#xD;
had disappeared, and the light of a waning&#xD;
moon ~hed its soft beams through the in-&#xD;
terstices of the forest. With great diffi-&#xD;
culty Tom drew a knife from his pocket,&#xD;
and turning upon his side cut the thongs&#xD;
which bound Kelborn's arms, when the&#xD;
latter performed the same kind office for&#xD;
his liberator. Cautiously rising to their&#xD;
feet they ascertained that they were en-&#xD;
tirely surrounded by the dusky forms of&#xD;
the savages. Slowly advancing along the&#xD;
way which appeared least encumbered&#xD;
with underbrush, Duncan found himself&#xD;
standing by the body of a powerful Chip-&#xD;
pewa, whose sleep was disturbed by the&#xD;
breaking of a twig beneath the prisoner's&#xD;
feet. The savage turned upon his side,&#xD;
and' for a moment Kelborn saw his dull,&#xD;
heavy eyes gazing into the gloom, with&#xD;
the 1~ncertain look of half-awakened con-&#xD;
sciousness. But his eyes closed, and the&#xD;
fugitives, stepping over his body, vanished&#xD;
amid the evergreens. Duncan was at a&#xD;
loss what course to pursue. At the time,&#xD;
their party was attacked he knew the Da-&#xD;
cotahs ~vere concealed at the foot of the&#xD;
pine, but he was ignorant of the direction&#xD;
it was necessary to take in order to join&#xD;
them. Their progress was necessarily&#xD;
slow, for they were still within the lines&#xD;
of the Ojibwa sentinels. Advancing then,&#xD;
through the copse of cedar and heml6ck,&#xD;
their progress was arrested by the head-&#xD;
less form of an Indian warr r, which lay&#xD;
in their path. A shudder ran through&#xD;
terribk~i~etribution ?"&#xD;
frame as, he looked pon the mu-&#xD;
tilated body of the dead. " Vhat violence&#xD;
has provoked this&#xD;
were thoughts that crowded upon his mind,&#xD;
as hi's eyes glanced at the war-paint of the&#xD;
Chippewas. Passing by the cold and no&#xD;
longer suffering clay, they continued to&#xD;
retreat, when Duncan was startled by a&#xD;
heavy hand laid upon his shoulder. Look-&#xD;
ing up, he saw the countenance of the&#xD;
Kentuckian.&#xD;
"And so you gave them the slip, did&#xD;
ye ~ he whispered; that was p erticu-&#xD;
larly well done. We have need of all our&#xD;
weapons, so thank fortin for't."&#xD;
"Do you intend to attack the Ojib~vas V'&#xD;
"Where is Clifton ?"&#xD;
"He is on the other side, with the Pan-&#xD;
ther."&#xD;
"And at a given signal you assail them&#xD;
at the same time?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Exactly; so now let us proceed."&#xD;
Duncan retraced his steps, and again&#xD;
passed the stiffened form of the Chippewa.&#xD;
Blount, surrounded by Kelborn, Tom, and&#xD;
half-a-dozen savages, now stood within&#xD;
five yards of their slumbering foes.&#xD;
lathe meantime, Edward and the young&#xD;
chief of the band, by a circuitous route,&#xD;
approached the Ojibwas from the opposite&#xD;
direction. As they were silently thread-&#xD;
ing their way through the thick under-&#xD;
wood, Clifton placed his foot upon a sub-&#xD;
stance ~uihich yielded to the pressure.&#xD;
Looking down, he saw the headless body&#xD;
of a Chippewa.&#xD;
"Great God! what can this mean, Pan-&#xD;
ther?"&#xD;
""'The chief surveyed the fearful object&#xD;
with a cold and impassive glance, and sha-&#xD;
king his head in doubt, passed onwards.&#xD;
After proceeding several rods further, the&#xD;
Panther's flexible form seemed rooted to&#xD;
the spot, as he glowered upon his uncon-&#xD;
scious enemies. The light of the moon&#xD;
pierced through the leaves, and fell upon&#xD;
the countenance of a Chippewa. Edward&#xD;
thought hc(w calmly he slept when sur-&#xD;
rounded by such peril. Before he had&#xD;
withdrawn hi~ glance he saw the rolling&#xD;
eyes of'the savage searching the recesses&#xD;
of the forest. His nostrils were dilated,&#xD;
while the rigid muscles and quivering&#xD;
form denoted the most absorbing attention.&#xD;
Edward was in the act of directing. the&#xD;
eyes of the Panther to the Chippewa, when&#xD;
the chirping of a squirrel was borne upon&#xD;
the night-air. The attention of Clifton had&#xD;
not been withdrawn from the Ojibwa. No&#xD;
sooner had the signal been given which&#xD;
brought a dozen rifles to the shoulders of&#xD;
the Dacotahs, than the Chippewa sprung&#xD;
to his feet and uttered a yell which made&#xD;
the arches of the forest ring with its ap-&#xD;
pallitig fierceness. In a moment the camp&#xD;
was 'in the wildest commotion. The Ojib-&#xD;
was, aroused from their sleep, seized&#xD;
their weapons, but, in the act of flying,&#xD;
they were met by a close and destructive&#xD;
fire from the Kentuckian and his compa-&#xD;
nions. Wheeling on the instant, they&#xD;
turned to the left, when a flame bursting&#xD;
from the rifles of Panther and the rest of&#xD;
the band, scattered them in wild disorder.&#xD;
Each one attempted, separately, to break&#xD;
through the ambushment. Among the&#xD;
fnremnst in the pursuit, Clifton observed&#xD;
the tall and powerful form of the Kentuck-&#xD;
ian. Following upon his footsteps, he saw&#xD;
him engaged in a conflict with a gigantic&#xD;
Chippewa. The struggle was short and&#xD;
fierce, when the battle-axe of Blount de-&#xD;
scended upon the head of his foe, crush-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ing through skull and brain to the chin of&#xD;
the grim warrior.&#xD;
The conflict was now only indicated by&#xD;
the occasional discharge o a ri e, and&#xD;
Edward was preparing to return to the&#xD;
pine, which he saw towering half a mile&#xD;
to his right, when he observed the thicket&#xD;
in front was furiously agitated. Muttered&#xD;
curses and the suppressed yell of an Indian&#xD;
indicated that the struggle was betweeii a&#xD;
white man and a savage.&#xD;
Advancing to the assistance of the for-&#xD;
mer, he had not succeeded in parting the&#xD;
dense foliage, when he heard the concus-&#xD;
sion of a heavy body with the earth, and&#xD;
then a blow, succeeded by a sound like the&#xD;
dropping of rain. Retreating footfalls min-&#xD;
gled with the convulsive throbs of the dying,&#xD;
reached his ears, and in a moment Ed-&#xD;
ward stood by the body of a savage. His&#xD;
blood curdled with horror as he discovered&#xD;
that the head was severed from the trunk,&#xD;
and the blood was gushing from the quiv-&#xD;
ering frame. The limbs contracted, the&#xD;
hands grasped a sapling in the violence of&#xD;
mortal agony, and when the suffering&#xD;
flesh rolled over, the limbs straightened,&#xD;
and the body became motionless.&#xD;
"Who can thus mutilate the hotly of an&#xD;
enemy ?" groaned Edward, as he gazed&#xD;
upon the cold, breathless form of the dead.&#xD;
"I will no longer assist those who can be&#xD;
guilty of such atrocity." Retracing his&#xD;
footsteps, he thought he saw the form of&#xD;
Blount gliding through the trees. The&#xD;
figure paused; an axe gleamed in the&#xD;
light of the moon, and then descended&#xD;
with a dull, heavy sound upon the earth.&#xD;
The next instant a round 'substance came&#xD;
whirling through the air, and falling at&#xD;
Clifton's feet, disclosed the hideous coun-&#xD;
tenance of an Indian warrior, with the&#xD;
ghastly seal of death stamped upon it.&#xD;
"Monster ~ shouted the excited young&#xD;
man, "you deserve death y ourself !" and&#xD;
Clifton raised his rifle until it covered the&#xD;
form of the Kentuckian. Not a muscle of&#xD;
the forester trembled, as he replied:&#xD;
"Young man, you had best hear the&#xD;
provocation afore you pa ssjudgment.~~&#xD;
The weapon 'descended, and Blount,&#xD;
advancing, laid his hand upon Edward's&#xD;
shoulder and said, with a slow, but solemn&#xD;
enunciation, and in language of the purest&#xD;
Saxon.&#xD;
Come, sit you down upon this log,&#xD;
while I recount to you a tale of violence&#xD;
and blood. Years ago, my father, inspired&#xD;
with religious zeal, determined to disclose&#xD;
the truths of the Bible to the heathen.&#xD;
My mother, a pious Christian herself, re-&#xD;
solved to accompany him, and as she&#xD;
&#xD;
CLII&#xD;
&#xD;
~' TON.                           71&#xD;
would not be separated from me, *e all&#xD;
three started for the hunting grounds of&#xD;
the Chippewas. I was then fifteen years&#xD;
old. While my father was labouring with&#xD;
religious fervor in the cause of the&#xD;
tribe, my mother prepared the provisions,&#xD;
~vhich I brought to the cabin. She in-&#xD;
structed the females in the art of cooking,&#xD;
and taught them the blessings of Divine&#xD;
truth. We were thus leading a happy&#xD;
and useful life, when, returning one day,&#xD;
loaded with game, to supply our humble&#xD;
table, I saw the headless corpse of my&#xD;
mother upon the floor, with her hair dab.&#xD;
bled in the blood." The respiration of&#xD;
the Kentuckian became difficult; he&#xD;
grasped at his throat, and for a moment&#xD;
his form shook as with the throes of disso-&#xD;
lution. In a short time, however, the scald-&#xD;
ing tears poured down his cheeks, and his&#xD;
head fell upon his bosom.&#xD;
"The dastardly Ojibwas committed the&#xD;
deed," continued the Kentuckian. "I&#xD;
swore upon the Bible which my mother&#xD;
so much prized, that one hundred head-&#xD;
less savages should avenge her death. I&#xD;
learned from the weeping females who&#xD;
mourned her loss, that two warriors enter-&#xD;
ed our cabin, maddened with fire-water,&#xD;
and when that dear mother said she could&#xD;
not supply them with more lkfuor, they&#xD;
brutally murdered her. In, ten minutes I&#xD;
was upon their footsteps. They had re-&#xD;
treated far into the forest, where at length,&#xD;
overcome with liquor, the y sunk upon the&#xD;
earth in a state of stupefaction. In five&#xD;
minutes they were both bound and gagged.&#xD;
I was iii no hastefor I had determined to&#xD;
postpone my vengeance until they were&#xD;
sober. At length their dull, heavy eyes&#xD;
began to observe my movements. I was&#xD;
piling around their forms, heaps of brush&#xD;
and logs. Upon reflection, I resolved to&#xD;
immolate them separately. One, the most&#xD;
demoniacal, I reserved as a witness of&#xD;
the other's sufferings. Dragging him to one&#xD;
side by the scalp-lock, I slightly elevated&#xD;
him against a log, so that he might have&#xD;
a full view of the sacrifice. By the time&#xD;
I had arranged the wood for the torch, the&#xD;
effects of the liquor had disappeared.&#xD;
They knew ~there was no hope of mercy,&#xD;
for they recognized me as the son of their&#xD;
victim. Their countenances turned a&#xD;
shade lighter as the blood retreated to&#xD;
their hearts; their spirits were not aroused&#xD;
by the war-dance and the torture; their&#xD;
lips quivered and their eyeballs glared.&#xD;
The small blaze expanded, and the smoke&#xD;
curled upwards, as the fiery element eat&#xD;
up the dry timbers I had taken the pre-&#xD;
caution to lash thesavage to the roots of a&#xD;

tree, and escape was hopeless. The flame&#xD;
stole along the quivering flesh, as the&#xD;
skin crisped and cracked beneath its fury.&#xD;
The terrible agony forced large drops of&#xD;
sweat from the forehead of the murderer,&#xD;
but the fire which now mounted to his&#xD;
breast, dried them up. The blood trickled&#xD;
from his cheeks, and one eye started from&#xD;
its socket. The dry piece of wood with&#xD;
which I had gagged him now caught&#xD;
fire, and as the flame curled along its sur-&#xD;
face the lips were consumed, and the&#xD;
mouth presented the ghastly appearance&#xD;
of a skeleton. He was dead. The other&#xD;
savage was burnt iii the same way, and&#xD;
then, overcome by the horrors of the&#xD;
scene, I fell senseless to the earth. When&#xD;
I recovered, the moon was shedding her&#xD;
rays upon the blackened corpses of the&#xD;
dead."&#xD;
"Since that hour eighty Chippewas&#xD;
have fallen by my hand. When I have&#xD;
slain one hundred, my vengeance will be&#xD;
satisfied. Not till then. But see, daylight&#xD;
has returned, and the band are mustering&#xD;
with fresh scalps at their girdles."&#xD;

SHAKSPEARE.&#xD;
IT was in the spring of 183- that Ed-&#xD;
ward commenced the study of law, in one&#xD;
of the slave-holding States. He entered&#xD;
the office of a lawyer, ~who resided in a&#xD;
small provincial town. Bending all his&#xD;
energies to the task, he suffered nothing&#xD;
to divert his attention from it, until nearly&#xD;
the close of his probation, when he was&#xD;
invited to attend a caucus of the Demo-&#xD;
cratic party. The question was argued&#xD;
whether Col. Johnson or Gov. Polk, ought&#xD;
to be nominated for the Vice-Presidency.&#xD;
The debate had been prolonged, as Edward&#xD;
thought, rather unnecessarily, when he&#xD;
rose to address the meeting. It was his&#xD;
first attempt, and his embarrassment was&#xD;
by no means diminished, when he dis-&#xD;
covered that all eyes were bent upon him.&#xD;
Murmuring voices were hushed, and pro-&#xD;
found silence pervaded the room. At first&#xD;
he stammered, but gradually recovering&#xD;
his self-possession, he expressed his opi-&#xD;
nions with a precision and fire, which elici-&#xD;
&#xD;
ted the approbation of his auditors. After&#xD;
rapidly reviewing the political field, he&#xD;
reverted to the impolicy of striking from&#xD;
the ticket, the war-worn soldier, who had&#xD;
been elected to the Vice-Presidency in&#xD;
1836. "If," pursued he, "you are resolved&#xD;
to support the present chief magistrate&#xD;
for re-election, what reason can you&#xD;
assign for dropping the name of Col. John-&#xD;
son? .If he is as worthy now as he was&#xD;
in 1836, will it not be a fatal, nay, disho-&#xD;
nourable departure from the policy of the&#xD;
Democratic party, which rewards fidelity&#xD;
instead of betraying it? As for the Go-&#xD;
vernor of Tennessee," continued the ani-&#xD;
mated speaker, "he is a candidate for re-&#xD;
election in 1841; and whatever may be&#xD;
the politicall distinctions which 'hereafter&#xD;
are to be conferred upon him, let him first,&#xD;
effectually revolutionize the State and when&#xD;
the principles of the Democratic party are&#xD;
thoroughly re-established, and a shout of&#xD;
triumph is raised throughout the hills and&#xD;
valleys of Tennessee, then reward Col.&#xD;
Polk." As the youthful speaker sat down,&#xD;
the applause was general and enthusiastic,&#xD;
and he heard murmuring inquiries of&#xD;
"Who is he ?" "Whoever he may be, he&#xD;
expresses'the correct view of the subject;?'&#xD;
and the ca~icus so decided.&#xD;
A week had scarcely elapsed before a&#xD;
committee waited upon him, for the pur-&#xD;
pose of obtaining his consent to address a&#xD;
mass meeting of the democracy of the&#xD;
county, ~vhich was to assemble in two&#xD;
weeks. Clifton with much diffidence, ac-&#xD;
cepted the invitation.&#xD;
The society, in the village was not by&#xD;
any means thp most moral. I speak, of&#xD;
course, of that portion composed of males.&#xD;
Many of the most prominent citizens were&#xD;
devoted to hunting, fishing, gaming, and&#xD;
the most reckless and desperatee amuse-&#xD;
ments, and so far as they were concerned,&#xD;
Sunday afforded no barrier to their orgies.&#xD;
The leader of the band, Col. Penton, had&#xD;
taken offence because Edward failed to&#xD;
accept an invitation to join it. The polite&#xD;
and dignified bearing of our hero had,&#xD;
thus far, however, prevented a collision.&#xD;
The event could not long be postponed,&#xD;
when Fenton was determined to produce&#xD;
a rupture.&#xD;
The head quarters of himself and fol-&#xD;
lowers, who numbered about a dozen, was&#xD;
wherever they chose to assemble and con-&#xD;
sequently few hotels or counting-rooms&#xD;
in the village were exempted from their&#xD;
weekly forays.&#xD;
Edward had hitherto managed to avoid&#xD;
them2 but a few days previous to the mass&#xD;
meeting, having occasion to examine some&#xD;
&#xD;
political work, he entered the law office of&#xD;
one of his friends. He had closed the&#xD;
door and advanced into the room, when&#xD;
he discovered that it was already occupied&#xD;
by Fenton, and a portion of his satellites.&#xD;
Bowing courteously, he advanced to the&#xD;
book-case, and sought for the volume.&#xD;
" Yes, ~ said Fenton, in a loud, imperious&#xD;
tone, "I cannot admire that modesty&#xD;
which will permit a beardless youth, and a&#xD;
stranger, to attempt the instruction of older&#xD;
and better-informed men than himself."&#xD;
A profound silence followed this decl -&#xD;
tion. Clifton, aware that a personal colli-&#xD;
sion might ensue, was bent upon placing&#xD;
his adversary clearly in the wrong.&#xD;
"I told you he could not be kicked into&#xD;
a fight !" audibly remarked a bully.&#xD;
"Ay, 'tis evident he will show the&#xD;
white feather."&#xD;
"To render my meaning perfectly ap-&#xD;
parent," resumed Fenton, with an insuffer-&#xD;
able tone and manner, "I will express&#xD;
it as my opinion that a Northern man,&#xD;
especially a white-livered one, like the indi-&#xD;
vidual who is now honoring us with his&#xD;
presence, is the last person who should&#xD;
possess sufficient audacity, to lecture well-&#xD;
informed and sensible men."&#xD;
Edward had gradually faced the speaker,&#xD;
and, folditig his arms across his chest,&#xD;
while the blood mounted to his cheek,&#xD;
and a glance of withering contempt shot&#xD;
across his features, he replied slowly&#xD;
and distinctly. "I possess neither the&#xD;
audacity, nor the mendacity, of the black-&#xD;
guard who has just addressed me. Nay,&#xD;
start not; you have sought a quarrel, and&#xD;
you shall now witness the end of it. It is&#xD;
he alone who deserves the appellation of&#xD;
white-livered, who, desirous of insulting an&#xD;
unoffending stranger, does not possess suf-&#xD;
ficient courage to do it, until he is sur-&#xD;
rounded by his minions, and then coward-&#xD;
like, he commits the outrage."&#xD;
"Hell and furies !" exclaimed Fenton,&#xD;
stung to madness by the taunts of Clifton,&#xD;
"you leave not this room, until you have&#xD;
expiated this insult." And he flung him-&#xD;
self against the door.&#xD;
Clifton's eyes flashed intolerable fre&#xD;
he exclaimed, " Fool~i and dotard!" Lay-&#xD;
ing his powerful gras~up on Fenton's head,&#xD;
he clasped his hair 4nd twirling him sud-&#xD;
denly round, with thd other hand he seized&#xD;
his pantaloons, and dashing him headlong&#xD;
over the stove, he fell heavily beneath the&#xD;
desk, where he lay stunned and motion-&#xD;
less. Fenton's comrades sprang to their&#xD;
feet, and loudly exclaimed, "Knock him&#xD;
down! trample upon him !" but as Edward&#xD;
seized a billet of wood, and held it aloft,&#xD;
&#xD;
no one dared to attack him, and the up-&#xD;
roar soon ceased.&#xD;
"Now then," said hein a loud, autho-&#xD;
ritative voice, " remove the carcass of that&#xD;
vagabond and when either of you are&#xD;
disposed wantonly to assail one who has&#xD;
never wronged you, invite m~ to be pre-&#xD;
sent I will agree, in advance, to accept&#xD;
that invitation ;" and turning upon his heel,&#xD;
he left the office.&#xD;
The spirit of Fenton was effectually&#xD;
su dued. Whenever he was disposed to&#xD;
sume a domineering manner, it was&#xD;
only necessary to refer to his encounter&#xD;
with the" Northerner," and he was silenc-&#xD;
ed. His followers, no longer held together&#xD;
by their leader, disbanded, Fenton disap-&#xD;
peared, and the peaceful inhabitants of&#xD;
Sherwood, were iio longer disturbed by&#xD;
their carousals.&#xD;
The day for the meeting of the demo-&#xD;
cr~cy at length arrived. At an early hour&#xD;
the streets were thronged ~vith equestrians,&#xD;
footmen, and carriages, and at 12 o'clock,&#xD;
more than a thousand persons had congre-&#xD;
gated from the country. As our hero saw&#xD;
them pouring into the town, along every&#xD;
road which led to it, his feelings were&#xD;
agitated, and he was affected by that&#xD;
nervous excitement, which even the most&#xD;
accomplished orators can never evade.&#xD;
The court-house bell pealed merrily, sum-&#xD;
moning the speaker and the audience to&#xD;
the place of rendezvous. To the former,&#xD;
each stroke seemed to fall upon his heart-&#xD;
strings. Rousing himself, however, he&#xD;
threaded the streets in the direction of the&#xD;
multitude, recognizing, as he went, with&#xD;
his accustomed courtesy, those persons&#xD;
whom he knew, or returning the saluta-&#xD;
tions of those who beheld in him the&#xD;
orator 'of the day, and the defender of their&#xD;
principles. Entering a clerk's office until&#xD;
the meeting was organized, he walked to&#xD;
and fro, under the influence of that restless&#xD;
excitement, which it is impossible to con-&#xD;
trol. He was about to address a large and&#xD;
promiscuous audience, composed of both&#xD;
parties, for he had observed among the&#xD;
crowd, some intelligent and influential&#xD;
whigs. Those who had heard his speech in&#xD;
the caucus, had prepared others to expect a&#xD;
brilliant display, while his enco~.inter with&#xD;
Fenton, had already made him somewhat&#xD;
celebrated. He was conscious of being tho-&#xD;
roughly prepared upon political questions,&#xD;
still, if he should unfortunately "blunder&#xD;
at the start," it would have a fatal influ-&#xD;
ence upon his future career.&#xD;
These thoughts flashed across his mind,&#xD;
when the door was opened and he was&#xD;
summoned to "take the stump.~~ As he&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8086-00000032"/>&#xD;
74                            CLII&#xD;
passed into the court-room, a friend whis-&#xD;
pered, "Can you go through with it~"&#xD;
"I'll try !" was the brief response; and&#xD;
passing through the avenue 'of human&#xD;
beings e ascended the tribune. The&#xD;
court-house was literally crowded; stand-&#xD;
ing-room could not be obtained and even&#xD;
the windows were filled.&#xD;
The questions which divided the two&#xD;
parties at that time, have now become&#xD;
obsolete. The Compromise bill, was then&#xD;
gradually running through the descending&#xD;
scale, to the revenue standard, and it was&#xD;
left to a later day, to renew the angryAis-&#xD;
cussion, which preceded the adoption of&#xD;
that "treaty of peace and amity." The&#xD;
suspension of the banks, in 1837, had caus-&#xD;
ed pecuniary embarrassment throughout&#xD;
the Union, and was made the pretext for&#xD;
an attempt to re-charter the United States&#xD;
Bank. The Democratic party, adhering,&#xD;
even during a period of gloom and disas-&#xD;
ter, to a long-cherished principle, advo-&#xD;
cated a divorce of the government from&#xD;
banks, by the establishment of a constitu-&#xD;
tional treasury, or a ~sub.treasury,) as it&#xD;
was designated at that time. The ques-&#xD;
tion of the currency, therefore, was the&#xD;
theme which the exigency of the times&#xD;
made it necessary for Edward to discuss.&#xD;
It is not our intention to give more than&#xD;
a brief synopsis of the speech, which&#xD;
gave our hero, at once, the reputation of&#xD;
an oratorQ and a profound and able rea-&#xD;
soner.&#xD;
Rapidly glancing at the condition of the&#xD;
country, and referring to the sensitiveness&#xD;
with which every individual regarded the&#xD;
convulsions that affected his pecuniary re-&#xD;
sources, he proceeded:&#xD;
But, gentlemen, it should not be for-&#xD;
gotten with what facility we overlook, in&#xD;
the prosperity of to-day, the disasters&#xD;
of yesterday. The memory is treacherous,&#xD;
unless there is something tangible to con-&#xD;
trol it. If we see a tree blasted by light-&#xD;
ning, or a forest leveled by a tornado, our&#xD;
memory brings the event freshly to our&#xD;
minds, whenever the eye rests upon the&#xD;
shivered trunk, or ~turned roots. In pe-&#xD;
cuniary affairs it is otherwise. We either&#xD;
say money was never so plenty before, or&#xD;
what is much more common, it was never&#xD;
so scarce. Our opponents trace the wide-&#xD;
spread disasters which cripple commerce&#xD;
and trade, and deprive agriculture of its&#xD;
due reward, to the non-existence of a&#xD;
National Bank. Now, would you for a&#xD;
moment suppose that still greater distress&#xD;
and embarrassment pervaded the whole&#xD;
country during the career of the last Bank&#xD;
of the United States V~&#xD;
&#xD;
TO0N.4&#xD;
&#xD;
The speaker paused, and profound si-&#xD;
lence reigned throughout the room.&#xD;
"Never !" thundered an excited whig.&#xD;
"I demand tho.proof.~&#xD;
Clifton cast a withering look upon the&#xD;
person who had interrupted him, and&#xD;
without removing his gaze, he proceeded:&#xD;
"If the gentleman had preserved silence&#xD;
for a moment, he would have avoided an&#xD;
exposure of his ignorance, and want of&#xD;
breeding. As it is, he has not only be-&#xD;
trayed both, but what is of far more im-&#xD;
portance to the argument, he has proved&#xD;
that the whole question hinges upon this&#xD;
one proposition. If more general distress&#xD;
arid embarrassment prevailed throughout&#xD;
the Union while the last National Bank&#xD;
was in successful operation, than at the&#xD;
pmsent moment, would it not be th~&#xD;
height of folly to look to that institutioti&#xD;
again for relief"&#xD;
"Ay! ay !" was the unanimous re-&#xD;
sponse from the democracy, while the&#xD;
whigs were silent.&#xD;
"Now to the proof. In 1824, Mr. Clay&#xD;
made a speech-~ copy of which I now&#xD;
hold in my hand-upon the tariff in which&#xD;
he drew a frightful picture of the ruin and&#xD;
disaster which pervaded the whole coun-&#xD;
try, declaring that the products of the&#xD;
farmer "were rotting in the barns and&#xD;
barnyards for want of a market." Now&#xD;
will the gentleman inform me if anything&#xD;
approaching the frightful features in this&#xD;
picture can be painted at the present tinie l&#xD;
The late Bank of the United States went&#xD;
into operation in 1817, and a sufficient&#xD;
length of time had elapsed, when Mr.&#xD;
Clay made his speech, to enable that in-&#xD;
stitution to produce the financial revul-&#xD;
sions which were the foundation of its&#xD;
successful career. This proposition brings&#xD;
me to another ranch of the question. The&#xD;
scarcity of money produced a depression&#xD;
in the price of all articles which were in&#xD;
the market for sale. This scarcity it was&#xD;
easy for the National Bank, with its gi-&#xD;
gantic power, to produce. The endorse-&#xD;
ment of the government had rendered its&#xD;
paper more valuable, because more con-&#xD;
venient, than gold and silver. In many&#xD;
operations, therefore. specie, as well as&#xD;
the notes of local banks, were exchanged&#xD;
for the bills of the United States Bank, and&#xD;
a premium given therefore. The gold and&#xD;
silver were exported, and an additional pre-&#xD;
mium ol~tained, while the local bank&#xD;
paper, when amassed in sufficient quanti-&#xD;
ties, was presented for redemption, and&#xD;
the specie was either withdrawn, or the&#xD;
bank was broken. The inevitable result&#xD;
was the creation of a vacuum in the&#xD;
&#xD;
CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
money market, which was supplied by&#xD;
the notes of the National Bank. All that&#xD;
was necessary, then, to create a panic,&#xD;
was for the bank to decline the purchase&#xD;
of commercial paper, and to demand pay-&#xD;
ments of its debtors. Stocks, merchan-&#xD;
dise, and agricultural productions, fell en-&#xD;
ormously, and tli~n the agents of the Bank&#xD;
made investments at prices which ruined&#xD;
the seller. Paper was now freely dis-&#xD;
counted, money became plenty, prices had&#xD;
an upward tendency, and a handsome&#xD;
profit was made by the bank upon its in-&#xD;
vestments."&#xD;
This ingenious view of the subject was&#xD;
received by a shout of approbation.&#xD;
"As for the sub.treasury,~ said the&#xD;
speaker, when he directed his attention&#xD;
to that subject, "it simply provides that&#xD;
government officers shall collect and dis-&#xD;
burse the public funds, by an arrangement&#xD;
similar to that which is in operation in this&#xD;
State. If defalcations occur, when a penal&#xD;
clause is inserted in the bill,-which is&#xD;
extremely doubtful-it will be no more&#xD;
than your owg local treasury is liable to.&#xD;
Indeed, it is a risk which no man who&#xD;
employs the services of an agent can,&#xD;
avoid. Nevertheless, it should hot be sup-&#xD;
posed that the (lefalcations of Swartwout&#xD;
and Price, occurred under the operations&#xD;
of an independent treasury, such as the&#xD;
Democratic party would establish, but&#xD;
under the act of 1789, which does not in-&#xD;
flict a penalty sufficiently severe upon the&#xD;
"Fairly and strongly put," exclaimed&#xD;
the crowd.&#xD;
"No inconsiderable amount of political&#xD;
capital has been made by the specious&#xD;
charge that we advocate one kind of a&#xD;
currency for the people, and another for&#xD;
the government. It is a triumphant reply&#xD;
to this assertion, that we advocate the col-&#xD;
lecti(,n and disbursement of the public&#xD;
funds in gold and silver, the only constitu-&#xD;
tional currency of the country. If unwise&#xD;
legislators have created a depreciated and&#xD;
worthless circulation for the people, the&#xD;
sin should not be'laid at our doors. We&#xD;
recortimend a sound circulating medium&#xD;
for all, that one established by the Consti-&#xD;
tution of the United States. It is no fault&#xD;
of ours if the Whig party clings, with a&#xD;
fatal devotion, to those rotten institutions&#xD;
which inundate the country with a rag&#xD;
currency."&#xD;
And again the multitude swayed to and&#xD;
fro, and loudly applauded the speaker as&#xD;
he descended from the stand. His friends&#xD;
gathered around him and warmly praised&#xD;
&#xD;
75&#xD;
&#xD;
his effort, and even strangers shook his&#xD;
hand with fervor.&#xD;
As the crowd dispersed, Col. Warner&#xD;
observed to Dr. Dinmore:&#xD;
"It was a masterly refutation of the&#xD;
charges made by our opponents."&#xD;
a splendid effort; that young~&#xD;
man must be sustained; if he settles among&#xD;
us. By the way, did you see how puzzled&#xD;
the whig aspirant looked ~ Egad, he be-&#xD;
came purple, blue, red, and white, by&#xD;
turn5."&#xD;
"Ha! ha! ha!"&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
"Oh! if thou lowest,&#xD;
And art a woman, hide thy love from him&#xD;
Whom thou dost worship; never let him know&#xD;
How dear he is; flit like a bird before him-&#xD;
Lead him from tree to tree, from flower to flower;&#xD;
But he not won, or thou mightat, iike that bird,&#xD;
When caught and caged, be ieft to pine neglected,&#xD;
And perish in forgetfulness."  LANOON.&#xD;
CLIFTON, after a brief period of intense&#xD;
study, was admitted as a member of the&#xD;
bar, and commenced the practice of the&#xD;
law. There was oiily one lawyer besides&#xD;
himself in the small village where he&#xD;
opened an office, and his arrival, there-&#xD;
fore, was an event of considerable impor-&#xD;
tance.&#xD;
The day following, several young ladies&#xD;
met at the house of Judge Douglass.&#xD;
"What is the personal appearance of&#xD;
the strangerV~ inquired Emily Davidson.&#xD;
"Rather preposse ssin~" responded Mar-&#xD;
garet Fisher, "though his brow is some-&#xD;
what stern and his bearing haughty."&#xD;
"The impression he made upon me,"&#xD;
interposed the beautiful and piquant Miss&#xD;
Douglass, "was, I must confess favoura-&#xD;
ble. Perhaps, however, my opinion was&#xD;
somewhat influenced by gratitude."&#xD;
"How so ~" exclaimed her vivacious&#xD;
companions, with much eagerness~ "sure-&#xD;
ly some romantic adventure must be the&#xD;
cause of those blushes which mantle your&#xD;
cheek."&#xD;
"Nay, it surel~r was an affair of but&#xD;
slight importance, 'responded the damsel;&#xD;
"he only prevented my horse fromplunging&#xD;
off the precipice yesterday, as I was dash-&#xD;
ing along the bank of the river. Any&#xD;
gentleman would have performed the&#xD;
same act, you know; but this Mr. Clif-&#xD;
toii happened to be present, and witnes-&#xD;
sing my perilous situation, rushed for-&#xD;

76&#xD;
&#xD;
CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
ward, and, I believe I must confess, saved&#xD;
my life at great hazard to himself."&#xD;
It was quite apparent to her auditors&#xD;
that Helen Douglass was more deeply&#xD;
affected by the frightful danger she had&#xD;
encountered the previous day, than she&#xD;
dared to disclose% for her cheek blanched&#xD;
'before she concluded.&#xD;
The introduction of Edward to the small&#xD;
but select circle of Stamford occurred&#xD;
under favourable circumstances. He had&#xD;
rescued the daughter of Judge Douglass&#xD;
from imminent peril, if not from sudden&#xD;
death. The next morning that gentleman&#xD;
called upon him.&#xD;
"I have not only presented myself," said&#xD;
the Judge, "for the purpose of welcoming&#xD;
to our village a gentleman and a stranger,&#xD;
but also to express the deep obligations I&#xD;
am under to you as the preserver of my&#xD;
daughters exi5tence.~~&#xD;
Clifton, to whom anything approaching&#xD;
a scene was excessively disagreeable, re-&#xD;
plied: "It is scarcely worth a second&#xD;
thought; it was simply my good fortune&#xD;
to be approaching Stamford, when my&#xD;
attention was arrested 1y a shriek, and,&#xD;
spurring my steed forward, I had only to&#xD;
extend my hand to arrest the frightened&#xD;
horse that Miss Douglass was riding."&#xD;
"The obligations which myself and&#xD;
Helen are under to you will nevertheless&#xD;
long be remembered."&#xD;
Edward bowed and ch&#xD;
anged the sub-&#xD;
have a charming village," said&#xD;
he. "and located in what appears to me&#xD;
to be a rich and highly cultivated coun-&#xD;
try."&#xD;
"'Tis true that it is the seat of much&#xD;
wealth and zefin~ment, and its proximity&#xD;
to the capital of the State makes it a de-&#xD;
lightful locality for residencec"&#xD;
"I observed," said our hero, "on my&#xD;
way hither, that political questions are&#xD;
the all-absorbing themes at the present&#xD;
time among your citizens."&#xD;
"The election between our candidates&#xD;
for Governor has been contested thus far&#xD;
with more than ordinary energy, as you&#xD;
have doubtless observed."&#xD;
" The system in practice at the South,'~&#xD;
observed ~lifton, "is, I think, far prefer-&#xD;
able to that which more generally prevails&#xD;
at the North. Nothing can be fairer than&#xD;
these public discussions. Not only the&#xD;
political principles of the aspirants are&#xD;
disclosed, but their character for consist-&#xD;
ency is open for investigation.~~&#xD;
"Whether for better or. for worse,"&#xD;
responded the Judge, "stumping is now&#xD;
universally practiced by candidates for all&#xD;
&#xD;
offices, not even excepting those who are&#xD;
desirous of being elected constables."&#xD;
As the Judge rose to depart, he extend-&#xD;
ed the hospitalities of his house to Edward,&#xD;
who promised to accept the invitation at&#xD;
an early day.&#xD;
A month had not elapsed before our&#xD;
young lawyer was surrounded with phents,&#xD;
and his career promised to open wilh more&#xD;
than ordinary brilliance. Thus far he had&#xD;
merely received those who had called&#xD;
upon him. Among the number was&#xD;
young Dr. Fielding, a gentleman just&#xD;
arrived at majority, whose brilliant wit&#xD;
and frank manners made him a general&#xD;
favourite, and Col. Freeman, th young&#xD;
lawyer, who had long been a citizen of&#xD;
the place. Both these individuals had&#xD;
welcomed Edward to Stamford with much&#xD;
cordiality, and with each he soon became&#xD;
a favourite. Clifton was a democrat and&#xD;
Freeman was a w4hig, still they rarely&#xD;
engaged even in a good-natured discus-&#xD;
sion upon questions which, sooner than&#xD;
all others, makes the blood throb hotly in&#xD;
the veins. ~&#xD;
"And so," gaily exclaimt~d Fielding, as&#xD;
he entered Edward's office, "we are to&#xD;
have a party at the manor, to commemo-&#xD;
rate your gallantry in rescuing the accorn-&#xD;
plished heiress of that house."&#xD;
"Indeed; and who are to honour the&#xD;
occasion with their presence V'&#xD;
"The assemblage will be small, but&#xD;
wonderfully select. Foremost, will be the&#xD;
lion of the night, Edward Clifton, Esq.,&#xD;
Attorney at Law, and Solicitor in Chan-&#xD;
cery. Emy Davidson, Mag Fisher, and&#xD;
Cora Monroe, besides, an invitation has&#xD;
been sent to the peerless Virginia Drayton,&#xD;
who is the belle of the metropolis. So you&#xD;
will have no difficulty in discovering that&#xD;
the party will be one of no ordinary bril-&#xD;
liancy."&#xD;
"And how is a bashful gentleman like&#xD;
myself to encounter, without embarrass-&#xD;
ment, not to say without danger, such a&#xD;
formidable array of youth and beauty ?"&#xD;
"Oh, the thing is easily enough ma-&#xD;
naged," responded his vivacious com-&#xD;
panion. "I have never known the most&#xD;
cold-blooded bachelor (which, by the&#xD;
way, you are not), brought into close con-&#xD;

effective), where there are sparkling eyes,&#xD;

satins, without having his spirits elevated.&#xD;

crush, is like the pressure of the flower&#xD;

"I discover,~~ said Clifton, with a smile,&#xD;
you are not exclusively devoted to the&#xD;
healing art."&#xD;
"As much so,'~ retorted the other, "as&#xD;
you will be to Blackstone, or Kent's Com-&#xD;
mentaries, before you have mingled one&#xD;
year with the impulsive and warm-heart-&#xD;
ed girls of the South. Why, man, you&#xD;
have been literallyfrozen by your Northern&#xD;
dames. By the gods, during the time I was&#xD;
attending lectures at Philadelphia, I forgot&#xD;
almost how to feel among those cold, cau-&#xD;
tious damsels, and my blood did not re-&#xD;
gain its healthy action until I had been at&#xD;
home a month. But adieu! W~ shall&#xD;

Adjoining Edward's office, was a stately&#xD;
mansion; the grounds belonging to it's&#xD;
proprietor were overlooked by the win-&#xD;
dow at which our hero sat. Casting his&#xD;
eyes over them, they encountered the&#xD;
earnest, yet timid glance of a girl some&#xD;
thirteen years of age. Her large, black,&#xD;
lustrous orbs fell before his inquiring look,&#xD;
and turning hastily, she retraced her steps&#xD;
along the graveled and winding way. Be-&#xD;
fore vanishing amid the shrubbery, she&#xD;
cast a furtive glance at the young lawyer,&#xD;
and beholding his eyes still fixed upon&#xD;
her, Ellen Foster, with a strange thrill at&#xD;
her heartstrings, entered the mansion.&#xD;

No sleep till morn, when youth and pleasure meet,&#xD;
To chase the glowing hours with flying feet."&#xD;
Byuo~.&#xD;
AT nilie o'clock the company had as-&#xD;
embled, and the "manor" was brilliantly&#xD;
Illuminated. Some forty ladies, and about&#xD;
a equal number of gentlemen, comprised&#xD;
the assembled guests. When Edward&#xD;
entered, the floor was filled with dancers.&#xD;
The blaze of light, the enlivening music,&#xD;
and the array of beauty, for a moment&#xD;
arrested our hero's footsteps. The atten-&#xD;
tion of the host was, at the time, attracted&#xD;
in another direction, and as Clifton paus-&#xD;
ed, somewhat embarrassed, a beautiful&#xD;
nymph, with large, dark brown eyes, and&#xD;
a cheek, where the lily and the rose&#xD;
softly blended, advanced gracefully from&#xD;
amidst the dancers, and frankly extending&#xD;
her hand, introduced herself as Miss&#xD;
&#xD;
Douglass. Leading him forward, she&#xD;
presented him to her mother, who was&#xD;
warm in her thanks for the assistance he&#xD;
had rendered. her only chiJ~d.&#xD;
In a few minutes he wa'~ waltzing with&#xD;
Emily Davidson, whose sprightly man-&#xD;
ners, and sarcastic replies, seemed to&#xD;
amuse him exceedingly.&#xD;
"And you have really determined to&#xD;
settle; I believe, that is the phrase in this&#xD;
barbarous regiofl.~~&#xD;
"If barbarous, it has at least all the&#xD;
splendour of Eastern barbarism; at all&#xD;
events, there are hours here who would&#xD;
rival the choicest heautie~ in the Sultan's&#xD;
harem."&#xD;
"Indeed; perhaps you would like to&#xD;
possess his prerogative for the purpose of&#xD;
making a selection from among us." The&#xD;
tone with ~rhich she uttered this reply,&#xD;
was gradually lowered towards its close,&#xD;
so that it did not reach his ears, and he&#xD;
could only divine its tenor, from the warm&#xD;
blush which immediately suffused her&#xD;
cheek, at~l1 stealing along her brow, dyed&#xD;
even her beautifully formed ears with its&#xD;
roseate hue.&#xD;
~ pursue~I Edward;. "I have be-&#xD;
come a warm admirer of your men, since&#xD;
my brief sojourn in the State. There is a&#xD;
generous, frank, and chivalric trait in the&#xD;
Southern character, which cannot fail of&#xD;
winning our regard; at the same time, a&#xD;
prompt demand for satisfaction, when an&#xD;
insult is offered, commands our respect.&#xD;
Of the females, I am not prepared, in this&#xD;
presence, to avow what is the extent of&#xD;
my admiration."&#xD;
"Why don't you say adoration at once&#xD;
rather pertly inquired the damsel; "doubt-&#xD;
less, it will amount to that anon but the&#xD;
waltz is over so I will relieve you," and&#xD;
nodding arctAy, she glided away.&#xD;
Our hero now surveyed the company.&#xD;
Nearly all present were strangers to him.&#xD;
The ladies were beautifully, nay, many&#xD;
of them, splendidly robed. Point lace&#xD;
and flashing diamonds, abounded. The&#xD;
dresses, as was then the fashion, were cut&#xD;
exceedingly low in the neck, and display-&#xD;
ed to the untutored gaze, not only the&#xD;
rounded shoulder, but not unfrequently&#xD;
revealed glimpses of undulating bosoms&#xD;
which rose and fell with the calm and&#xD;
steady respiration, or swelled with the&#xD;
restlessness of uncontrollable emotion.&#xD;
Edward sought the hand of Helen&#xD;
D6uglass for the next quadrille.&#xD;
He soon ascertained that his partner,&#xD;
with her childlike simplicity and vivacity,&#xD;
possessed more than an ordinary share of&#xD;
mental acumen, and it was with a vague&#xD;

As he closed the volume, and threw his&#xD;
glance in the direction of the large man-&#xD;
sion, the beams of the full moon fell upon&#xD;
the soft and childlike countenance of a&#xD;
maiden, as she leaned from the casement,&#xD;
and gazed in the direction of his office.&#xD;

A FEW evenings after the party, Ed-&#xD;
ward entered the office of Col. Freeman.&#xD;
"You are welcome ~ said the&#xD;
latter, frankly. "This is an honour I have&#xD;
for some time expected. Take this rock-&#xD;
ing chair. t hope you will not think it too&#xD;
luxurious for a lawyer.~~&#xD;
"Certainly not; our profession is suffi-&#xD;
ciently laborious, even when we avail our-&#xD;
selves of any convenience."&#xD;
"Try a cigar; I can recommend them&#xD;
as the best Havana."&#xD;
"Thank you." And they were soon in-&#xD;
haling the delicious aroma, with their feet&#xD;
elevated as high as their heads.&#xD;
Are you apprised of the fact," in-&#xD;
quired Freeman, "that you were elected,&#xD;
last night, a member of our debating so-&#xD;
ciety, and selected to discuss, at the next&#xD;
meeting, the question whether conscience&#xD;
is an innate principle, implanted in the&#xD;
mind by the Almighty, or is formed and&#xD;
governed by education '?"&#xD;
"This is the first intimation I have had&#xD;
of it. And pray, which view of so grave&#xD;
a subject am I requested to advocate V'&#xD;
"As it is assumed a lawyer can make&#xD;
the worse a p pear the better cause; you&#xD;
are expected to negative the divine inter-&#xD;
"I am not certain but that upon this&#xD;
side lies the truth "observed Clifton.&#xD;
"Such being tile case, you have been&#xD;
rightly appropriated, and we shall see with&#xD;
what success you can combat the religious&#xD;
prejudices of this community."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Who compose the audience V'&#xD;
"All who choose to be present."&#xD;
"And who decides the question V'&#xD;
"The audience."&#xD;
"Do females attend V'&#xD;
"Whenever the attraction is sufficiently&#xD;
powerful; and as you are to discuss the&#xD;
question, I have no doubt the village will&#xD;
assemble en masse."&#xD;
"I am much obliged to you for the flat-&#xD;
tering assurance."&#xD;
"Indeed, I heard several ladies, inclu-&#xD;
ding the accomplished Mrs. Broughton&#xD;
and the Misses Drayton, Douglass, and&#xD;
Davidson observe last night, that they&#xD;
should listen to your maiden effort."&#xD;
"I shall consider myself highly ho-&#xD;
noured."&#xD;
"Intense study, without any recreation,"&#xD;
remarked Freeman, after a pause, "is not&#xD;
only disagreeable, but unprofitable; sup-&#xD;
pose we form a party of ladies and gen-&#xD;
tlemen for a fishing excur5iOnV'&#xD;
"WhiffierP'&#xD;
"Oh, to the Glen, to be sure. You ha~re&#xD;

your permission, we will pay the Glen a&#xD;
visit next Saturday. Sunday you can in-&#xD;
vestigate the religious subject which you&#xD;
are to debate Monday night, without pro-&#xD;
faning the Sabbath."&#xD;
"Well arranged; and I shall be at your&#xD;
command."&#xD;
According to the custom of the country,&#xD;
you must escort a lady, and as you are a&#xD;
stranger, it is but fair that y on should have&#xD;
your choice. After you have made it, ]~&#xD;

young men."&#xD;
"With such privileges, it is delightful to&#xD;
dwell in strange lands, and I shall regret&#xD;
the hour when I am naturalized."&#xD;
It was on a bright morning in the month&#xD;
of October, that' a joyous assemblage of&#xD;
equestrians left the village of Stamford, on&#xD;
a fishing excursion to the Glen. The party&#xD;
consisted of a dozen ladies and gentlemen;&#xD;
'among the number were the Misses&#xD;
whom Freeman had designated, together&#xD;
with Maj. Fisher, Cora Monroe, Clifton,&#xD;
Freeman, Fielding, and a bachelor-Maj.&#xD;
Harden-who escorted Mrs. Broughton.&#xD;
The Doctor rode by the side of Miss Dray-&#xD;
ton, Edward had selected Miss Douglass&#xD;
and the remainder were paired to suit&#xD;
themselves.&#xD;
The sky was unclouded, and the rays&#xD;
of the sun glittered through the smoky at-&#xD;
mosphere, and lighted upon the leaf as it&#xD;
fluttered to e ground, with that golden&#xD;

gated foliage which yet remained upon&#xD;
the trees, while it wafted gratefully to-&#xD;
wards the pleasure-seekers, the balmy fra-&#xD;
grance with which the forest was perfumed.&#xD;
The silence was profound, save when bro-&#xD;
ken by the chattering of the squirrel, the&#xD;
whirr of the partridge, or the merry laugh-&#xD;
ter of the equestrians. The Glen is a sheet&#xD;
of water, about six miles from the village.&#xD;
It is four miles in circumference, and sur-&#xD;
rounded by lofty hills. In the centre of&#xD;
the lake is an island containing some three&#xD;
acres of land, covered with forest trees.&#xD;
The surface of this island is diversified&#xD;
with hill and dale, and from a rocky por-&#xD;
tion of it a spring of cold and delicious&#xD;
water bursts forth, and winding along a&#xD;
miniature valley, mingles with the larger&#xD;
volume of the lake. The road for the last&#xD;
three miles wound along the acclivity of&#xD;
the mountain, and passing through a gorge,&#xD;
led to the margin of the lake. The path-&#xD;
way was scarcely wide enough for two&#xD;
horses to walk abreast~ still, the steeds&#xD;
which the ladies bestrode might stumble;&#xD;
and besides, it was excessively awkward&#xD;
conversing ~so far apart. Clifton and his&#xD;
companion rode in the rear.&#xD;
"Before I presume to take a position be-&#xD;
side you, in this narrow wayi~ said he, "I&#xD;
must beg you to direct me which side I am&#xD;
to ride ~ You know that is a debatable&#xD;
question."&#xD;
"If debatable, are you not at liberty&#xD;
to take either side ~ said the maiden,&#xD;
archly.&#xD;
"Certainly, unless I am prohibited from&#xD;
taking my choice by a ret ~iner."&#xD;
"I do not perceive that there is any one&#xD;
to detain you," replied the lady, as she&#xD;
turned her laughing eyes along the path&#xD;
which they had just traversed.&#xD;
"I regret that I gave you a choice of&#xD;
position," as soon as her cavalier was&#xD;
riding at her left, "this road is so very&#xD;
narrow; however, we are at the termina-&#xD;
tion of our journey." And the party con-&#xD;
gregated upon~the shore of the lake.&#xD;
"Ah haMr. Clifton! do you know you&#xD;
have committed an error in riding at the&#xD;
left side of Miss DouglassV' said Miss&#xD;
Drayton.&#xD;
"That is a debatable question," said&#xD;
Mrs. Broughton (Helen Douglass looked at&#xD;
Edward and smiled)," and the opinion now&#xD;
prevails that a gentleman is in a position&#xD;
to render more instantaneous and effectual&#xD;
aid, by riding upon her left."&#xD;
"There is this decided disadvantage,"&#xD;
replied Miss Drayton, "in riding upon that&#xD;
side, if the road is narrow, as I am sure&#xD;
Helen must have found it"-and she&#xD;
&#xD;
glanced at that lady with a bit of malice-&#xD;
"there is danger of your gallant becoming&#xD;
entangled in your habit, even if he does&#xD;
not come in contact with your person.~)&#xD;
fr(C That is true," said Mrs. Broughton,&#xD;
CC and it is the only argument which can&#xD;
be advanced in support of your position.&#xD;
On the contrary, as the gentleman holds&#xD;
the bridle in his left hand, it is impossi-&#xD;
ble for him, on the instant, either to sus-&#xD;
tain his companion in the saddle, or ar-&#xD;
rest the progress of her steed. And, what&#xD;
is of' equal importance, when the cavalier&#xD;
rides at the left he protects her from harm&#xD;
x~hile they are meeting or passing car-&#xD;
riages; whereas, if he rode upon her right,&#xD;
he would force the one he is required to&#xD;
defend into a position of danger.&#xD;
"Bravo! a triumphant speech !" ex-&#xD;
claimed the gentlemen.&#xD;
"After listening to powerful arguments&#xD;
from two highly intelligent and accom-&#xD;
plished ladies, it is hereby decided, upon&#xD;
the shores of this crystal lake, that~~for&#xD;
all time, the cavalier is to find his position&#xD;
..-while mounted-nearest the heart of his&#xD;
lady fair. Is that your decision, gentle-&#xD;
menV' continued Freeman.&#xD;
"Carried unanimously."&#xD;
"I am not surprised at your decision,&#xD;
gentlemen," tartly observed Virginia Dray-&#xD;
ton. "I believe, however, Col. Freeman,&#xD;
it is a well-settled principle of law, that an&#xD;
interested 'party shall be neither witness,&#xD;
judge, or juryman; so I shall appeal to an&#xD;
impartial tribunal."~&#xD;
"Faith, she has you there, brother,"&#xD;
said Clifton: "but come, let us dismount;&#xD;
our horses are 1mpatient.~~ Resting their&#xD;
hands upon the shoulders of their com-&#xD;
panions, the females gracefully descended&#xD;
from their steeds.&#xD;
"Here, Scipio, give these horses water&#xD;
and provender !" exclaimed Fielding to&#xD;
the African, who was mounted above a&#xD;
bag of corn and oats. "And you, Alfred,&#xD;
make ready the boat, and place your&#xD;
baskets in it."&#xD;
His orders were obeyed with cheerful-&#xD;
ness and alacrity, and in a few minutes&#xD;
the party were gliding swiftly across the&#xD;
bosom of the lake, in an elegant and com-&#xD;
modious barge. Boundiiig like fawns upon&#xD;
the beach, the ladies proceeded across the&#xD;
island to the point of the fishing-ground,&#xD;
followed by all the gentlemen, except&#xD;
young Davidson, who took Scipio and the&#xD;
boat, and proceeded in quest of game.&#xD;
Lines and fish-hooks were soon prepared,&#xD;
and seating themselves upon the rocks&#xD;
that jutted into the lake, they proceeded,&#xD;
&#xD;
in silence, to catch the bass and pickerel.&#xD;
The only sounds which awoke the pro-&#xD;
found solitude, ~vere the half-suppressed&#xD;
exclamations of the ladies, as' they landed&#xD;
a fish of more than, ordinary size-the&#xD;
rippling of the water upon the beach, and&#xD;
the report of Davidson's rifle, as it echoed&#xD;
through the forest,&#xD;
They had been so successful, that at&#xD;
length they began to converse in low&#xD;
tones not sufficiently audible to be heard&#xD;
by more than a solitary listener, for they&#xD;
had separated into pairs; as a matter of&#xD;
course, for the exclusive object of having&#xD;
the hooks of the ladies baited by the gen-&#xD;
tlemen. Clifton was seated by the side of&#xD;
Miss Drayton, Helen Douglass had ap-&#xD;
propriated Freeman, Fielding was playing&#xD;
the agreeable to Mrs. Broughton, and the&#xD;
remainder of the company were satisfac-&#xD;
torily arranged. Virginia Drayton suffered&#xD;
her buoy to float wherever it listed and&#xD;
leaning back upon her elbow, with one&#xD;
tiny foot extended so as to rest upon a&#xD;
projection of the rock,~ ~he raised her&#xD;
glance to her companion's face, and re-&#xD;
mayked, with accents of extreme sweet-&#xD;
ness-&#xD;
~How charming would be an existence&#xD;
upon a spot like this, with a being who&#xD;
could elicit the unfathomed depths of our&#xD;
affection. Fancy a cottage erected upon&#xD;
yonder plain, overlooking this silver&#xD;
lake, and within hearing of the murmur-&#xD;
ing rivulet that washes its base. Fur-&#xD;
ninhed with books, and instruments of&#xD;
music-with a companion who is all the&#xD;
most vivid fancy could desire, what Ma-&#xD;
homedan could pant for a more blissful&#xD;
paradise ?"&#xD;
Her eye, lighted with more than earthly&#xD;
beauty, the enthusiasm of. the moment&#xD;
sent t warm blood glowing to her cheek,&#xD;
and coursing along the blue veins which&#xD;
lined her temples; for she had, under the&#xD;
influence of the moment, thrown the thick&#xD;
clustering hair from her forehead.&#xD;
Edward gazed upon the lovely being,&#xD;
who half reclined before him, with undis-&#xD;
guised admiration.&#xD;
"Happy indeed must be that individual&#xD;
w~o can win the devotion of one, gifted&#xD;
wlffi every attribute which can claim the&#xD;
homage of our sex."&#xD;
"Even if the divinity be a coquette, as&#xD;
you once insinuated V' retorted the damsel,&#xD;
in whose eyes merriment had usurped&#xD;
the throne of pathos.&#xD;
Clifton's look-half angry, half discon-&#xD;
certed, only served to increase her laughter,&#xD;
which first was low and musical, but now&#xD;
rang forth in loud and merry peals. All&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
eyes were turned upon them, to ascertain&#xD;
what could cause so sudden an inter-&#xD;
ruption of the profoundest silence.&#xD;
Edward bit his lip as he turned away,&#xD;
and muttered, "I'll be even with you&#xD;
yet ;" and then bowing with as much&#xD;
blandness as if he had been neither be-&#xD;
trayed into sentimentality or ill-humour,&#xD;
he remarked,&#xD;
"This fair lady, was proving to me&#xD;
how easy is the transition from the sub-&#xD;
lime to the ridiculous, and rendered it so&#xD;
palpable, that, for a moment, I was sur-&#xD;
prised into moment"&#xD;
Freeman and Miss Douglass had ap-&#xD;
parently been engaged at repartee. As&#xD;
they rose to join the group, he remarked,&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, Miss Helen, but&#xD;
does not your boot require lacing Y'&#xD;
"No, but you do I" promptl~r responded&#xD;
the maiden.&#xD;
CC Fairly answered, by Jove ~ shouted&#xD;
Fieldimr, who had overheard the reply.&#xD;
CC But come! as master of ceremonies,~~&#xD;
continued he, "as well as your medical ad-&#xD;
viser, I suggest the propriety of a ramble&#xD;
through the sylyan shade. See ! our Nimrod&#xD;
has returned with abundance of game,&#xD;
and leaving the coloured fraternity to pre-&#xD;
pare our repast, let us forth !"&#xD;
Offering his arm to Virginia Dray-&#xD;
ton, they led the way to the spring.&#xD;
After quenching their thirst with the as-&#xD;
sistance of that southern household god, a&#xD;
gourd-they divided into small parties,&#xD;
and each threaded the forest as chance or&#xD;
fancy dictated. The island was covered&#xD;
with innumerable grape-vines, that wound&#xD;
high into the limbs of the trees. Deli-&#xD;
cious grapes, sweetened by the frost, were&#xD;
abundant, and gathering these as they&#xD;
strolled, the gay and happy party ~vhiled&#xD;
away an hour joyously.&#xD;
Suddenly they were all startled by a&#xD;
piercing shriek from Emy Davidson, and&#xD;
gathering quickly round her, they found&#xD;
the heroic girl was gazinG' in silence, but&#xD;

and quivering frame, upon an enormous&#xD;
rattlesnake which had fastened its fangs in&#xD;
her dress. With extraordinary presence of&#xD;
mind, she remained perfectly quiet, as&#xD;
though convinced, that by struggling to&#xD;
free herself , she would only increase her&#xD;
danger. In the mean time, Harden had&#xD;
seized a piece of &amp;amp;vood, which fortunately&#xD;
lay within his grasp, and soon succeeded&#xD;
in releasing the affrighted lady from her&#xD;
unpleas~int situation, n~bt, however, with-&#xD;
out relieving her of a portion of her dress.&#xD;

flood of tears.&#xD;
"You are a brave girl 1" said the ad-&#xD;
miring Harden, "and few would display&#xD;
such heroic courage.~~&#xD;
"But how did it happen," asked Clifton,&#xD;
"that the reptile struck without giving&#xD;
warning l I thought the victim always&#xD;
heard its rattles V'&#xD;
"True ;" said Harden, "and this mon-&#xD;
ster was not an exception. Apparently,&#xD;
he was aroused from his sleep by Miss&#xD;
Davidson stepping upon him, and the&#xD;
warning was so instantaneously followed&#xD;
by the attack, that she could not entirely&#xD;
escape."&#xD;
The ladies shuddered, as the enormous&#xD;
fangs were disclosed, and warmly ex-&#xD;
pressed their sympathy for the weeping&#xD;
girl, who now began to smile through her&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
It was now two o'clock, and a call from&#xD;
4heir sable attendants summoned them to&#xD;
their repast. The fare would have tempted&#xD;
the appetite of an epicure. Broiled fish&#xD;
and partridge, roaste(l duck and potatoes,&#xD;
bread, tea, coffee, cake, oranges, cham-&#xD;
pagne; and all in the greatest abun~1ance:&#xD;
spread out upon a spotless table-cloth:&#xD;
with cushions from the barge, upon whicl2&#xD;
the ladies reclined in the Oriental fashion&#xD;
Why, it had the witchery of enchantment&#xD;
And so it was regarded by the partici&#xD;
pants. in gay retort and sparkling re&#xD;
partee, they enjoyed the meal, and whet&#xD;
it was over, long did the gentlemen re&#xD;
dine at the feet of those beauteous girls.&#xD;
Time passed; and as they returned(&#xD;
across the water, the ladies sang "A lif&#xD;
on the ocean wave," and with their&#xD;
soprano, was mingled the tenor of Fiel&#xD;
and the baritone of Edward and Freeman&#xD;
The shades of evening were stealing ove&#xD;
the landscape, as the party dismounted a&#xD;
their homes.&#xD;

Behold a Sun, he spies a detty."  YOUNG.&#xD;
Xv an early hour, on Monday night, tb&#xD;
capacious Presbyterian church w~s throne&#xD;
ed with spectators. People had gathered&#xD;
&#xD;
from a long distance in the country, at-&#xD;
tracted thither by the novelty of the ques-&#xD;
tion, selected for debate, as well as by the&#xD;
reputation of the speakers. The oratori-&#xD;
cal powers of Clifton had been heralded&#xD;
from the adjacent village of Sherwood,&#xD;
where he had delivered his poliLical&#xD;
speech, and the eloquent and reverend p as-&#xD;
tor of the church had, at the earnest so7lici-&#xD;
tations of his friends, accepted an invita-&#xD;
tion to join the debate.&#xD;
The President of the society had as-&#xD;
sumed the chair, and the more youthful&#xD;
speakers had addressed him, when a large&#xD;
party of ladies entered the church together,&#xD;
and sweeping up the main aisle, seated&#xD;
themselves in the well-cushioned pew of&#xD;
Judge Douglass. As Clifton turned his&#xD;
glance in that direction, he saw among the&#xD;
number, his companions of the preceding&#xD;
Saturday, and answered with a bow their&#xD;
smile of recognition. The buzz of whis-&#xD;
pered conversation was hushed, as the&#xD;
clergyman rose- to address the President.&#xD;
It is not our purpose, to report the pro-&#xD;
found and skilful argument of the reverend&#xD;
gentleman, in attempting to demonstrate,&#xD;
what, indeed, is the popular belief, that&#xD;
conscience is an innate principle impiant-&#xD;
ed in the human mind, by a beneficent Pro-&#xD;
vidence for the guidance and protection&#xD;
of frail mortality.&#xD;
In the discussion of the subject, he em-&#xD;
- played all the resources which profound&#xD;
investigation and a powerful intellect&#xD;
~placedathiscommand;andasheresumed&#xD;
his seat, a murmur of approbation, which&#xD;
I would have swelled into a demonstration&#xD;
of applause, but for the sanctity of the&#xD;
~ clerical disputant, ran through the temple.&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton, closes the debate," said&#xD;
the President.&#xD;
r For a moment our hero was embarrass-&#xD;
.t ed, as he rose for the purpose of attempt-&#xD;
ing to sever the splendid chain of argu-&#xD;
ment which the divine had forged. He&#xD;
felt that the prejudices, if not the sym-&#xD;
pathies of the audience, were against him.&#xD;
Casting his eyes over the assemblage,&#xD;
they rested for a moment in that portion&#xD;
of the church occupied by Miss Douglass&#xD;
and her party. The countenance of that&#xD;
lady was slightly flushed with interest,&#xD;
while the expression upon the face of&#xD;
Miss Drayton was a little malicious. "I&#xD;
bet he will destroy the cobweb theories of&#xD;
the Doctor, whispered Mrs. Broughton to&#xD;
Virginia Drayton.&#xD;
~'So do I, but he shall not have the&#xD;
e benefit of that opinion. He has already&#xD;
a due appreciation of his own powers.~~&#xD;
d "~You say that, because you could not&#xD;
&#xD;
deceive him; is it not so l" jestingly in-&#xD;
quired the other.&#xD;
"He may yet find that he is not im-&#xD;
maculate !" said the belle, with a haughty&#xD;
curve of her superb neck.&#xD;
Further conversation was prevented, as&#xD;
the full and well-modulated voice of the&#xD;
speaker pronounced, "Mr. President,&#xD;
it is with great diffidence, that I shall&#xD;
attempt to follow the eloquent gentleman,&#xD;
through the splendid effort which he has&#xD;
just concluded. 1 will frankly admit, that&#xD;
he has exhausted the argument upon&#xD;
that side of the question, and it remains&#xD;
for me to assail, his reasoning, with such&#xD;
facts and theories as a much briefer in-&#xD;
vestigation places at my command. At&#xD;
the outset. I must beg that portion of the&#xD;
audience who belong to the reverend gen-&#xD;
tleman's church, not to receive his assump-&#xD;
tions with that implicit confidence which&#xD;
no doubt, his religious opinions are enti&#xD;
tled to, when promulgated from the sacred&#xD;
de~k. If they do, so far as they are con-&#xD;
cerned, the question is already decided.&#xD;
Th~ object of discussion is to evolve the&#xD;
truth; but if theories, advanced by one in&#xD;
whom, no doubt, great confidence is very&#xD;
justly placed, are received with the autho-&#xD;
rity of dogmas, then the right of thought&#xD;
is, utterly subverted, and the intelligent&#xD;
b~ing becomes no better than a walking&#xD;
This bold and not unskilful exordium,&#xD;
caused those to look upon the speaker ap-&#xD;
pr~ vingly, who were not       ortho-&#xD;
d c~x.                 strictly-&#xD;
"Admirably well put !" whispered&#xD;
Fielding to Mrs. Broughton. Miss Dray-&#xD;
toil could not avoid a pleased smile, while&#xD;
H~len Douglass cast a furtive glance at&#xD;
heir father, whose countenance was im-&#xD;
passive. The divine turned uneasily in his&#xD;
chair, and bestowed upon Edward it more&#xD;
critical observation than he had hitherto&#xD;
deigned.&#xD;
"It ~ resumed the speaker,&#xD;
"has not escaped your observation that&#xD;
the reveren(I gentleman has based his I&#xD;
argument upon such fact and theories as 1&#xD;
have been elicited by the ancient and I&#xD;
chosen people of God, orby the enlightened I&#xD;
segment of the human family. I trust,&#xD;
Mr. President, that this idea will not be 1&#xD;
forgotten, for upon it hinges the discus-&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
"The law of God, was clearly defined&#xD;
to our first parents. Before it was broken. I&#xD;
they were apprised of the penalty which I&#xD;
they so much dreaded. Hence the terror&#xD;
with which they' were seized, after the&#xD;
fatal sin had been committed. The temTh&#xD;
&#xD;
station was simply more overpowering,&#xD;
than the dread of punishment. So, when&#xD;
the commandments of God were given&#xD;
to Moses on the Mount, they were as&#xD;
specific as an enlightened legislature 'can&#xD;
render a law upon the statute-book. When&#xD;
one of those commandments was violated,&#xD;
the culprit feared the penalty which was&#xD;
inflicted. And at the present day, although&#xD;
the doctrines of the Bible are as various-&#xD;
ly interpreted as there are different de-&#xD;
nominations-and I believe the church of&#xD;
which the gentleman is so distinguished&#xD;
an ornament, has not been able to pre-&#xD;
serve its unity,.-~-still there can be no mis-&#xD;
understanding the reward which is be-&#xD;
stowed upon virtue, and the punishment&#xD;
that is inflicted upon vice."&#xD;
At this allusion to the secession of the&#xD;
Cumberland Presbyterians, and the evi-&#xD;
dent uneasiness it caused the divine, the&#xD;
majority of the audience could scarcely&#xD;
suppress their merriment. Mrs. Broughton&#xD;
and Virginia Drayton, who were inclined&#xD;
to Episcopacy, did not disguise the plea-&#xD;
sure which it gave them while Freeman&#xD;
sententiously pronounced the word "cen-&#xD;
tre."&#xD;
"But the error which the gentleman&#xD;
commits, and it is a fatal one,, as I con-&#xD;
ceive, is, in confounding conscience, with&#xD;
knowledge; or in other words, in assuming&#xD;
that to be an innate principle, which is&#xD;
merely the perception ofa fact. I deny that&#xD;
there is a monitor within, which apprises&#xD;
the sinner of his fault, when he tramples&#xD;
upon the commandments of the Almighty,&#xD;
that is not equally sleepless, and even&#xD;
more vigilant, when he violates the muni-&#xD;
cipal regulations of his country. The pe-&#xD;
nalty in the one case may be more terrible,&#xD;
but the punishment in the other may be&#xD;
more instantaneous. If it is necessary to&#xD;
illustrate a proposition, which is in itself&#xD;
almostt a demonstration, it is easily done.&#xD;

rhich stings the transgressor worse than&#xD;
he fangs of a scorpion. The fashionable&#xD;
swindler dreads exposure because he will&#xD;
ose caste; the slanderer, because he will&#xD;

"It surely is unnecessary to multiply&#xD;
examples ~or the purpose of proving that&#xD;
an unprincipled individual who utterly dis-&#xD;
regards the doctrines of the Bible, will'&#xD;
nevertheless, ponder long before he vio-&#xD;
lates a clause upon the statute-book; and&#xD;
that, too, when human justice, unlike&#xD;
Divine, is powerless over the sonl.&#xD;
"Thus far, Mr. President, I have con-&#xD;
fined my observations to that branch of&#xD;
the subject most favourable to the reve-&#xD;
rend gentleman. Indeed, to withhold&#xD;
ihe facts and deductions which can be&#xD;
drawn from that small segment of the&#xD;
human family, to whom the Bible is fami-&#xD;
liar, and his argument is wholly baseless.&#xD;
It ~4ould fall from its own weaknesss, with-&#xD;
out any assistance of mine.&#xD;

first from the Garden of Eden"&#xD;
parents&#xD;
have had the slightest knowledge of the&#xD;
word of God. Neither controlled by its&#xD;
precepts, nor curbed by the strong arm of&#xD;
the law, what frightful scenes of violence&#xD;
and wrong has it been the sad duty of the&#xD;
historian to record. I presume a divine&#xD;
so enlightened as the reverend gentleman.&#xD;
espouses the doctrine of that portion of&#xD;
his church who believe that the heathen&#xD;
will be exempt from the dreadful punish-&#xD;
inent which is visited upon the transgres-&#xD;
sor who sins understandingly, if I may use&#xD;
the expression. Am I correct in the&#xD;
assumption V' inquired he, bowing courte-&#xD;
ously to his opponent, who responded in&#xD;
the affirmative. "Well, then, unless my&#xD;
reverend friend has what a merchant&#xD;
terms a 'variety' of consciences, he must&#xD;
acknowledge himself worsted in the argu-&#xD;
ment. He must have as many, at le nist,&#xD;
' as there are classes of the human family.&#xD;
One sample must be a very stringent con-&#xD;
science, suitable for the enlirrhtened; an-&#xD;
other, with not quite as mucTi whalebone&#xD;
in it, just fitted for the civilized: the third.&#xD;
free and easy-quite an elastic affair-so&#xD;
that it may set gracefully upon the half-&#xD;
civilized; and the fourth exceedingly\lax,&#xD;
possessing sufficient capacity to alloW the&#xD;
barbarian to do exactly as he pleases.~-to&#xD;
bow to an idol, whether it is wood or stone,&#xD;
and to eat his human flesh fried, broiled,&#xD;
or in real cannibalistic style-raw I"&#xD;
The laughter, which had been with diffi-&#xD;
culty suppressed for some time, could no&#xD;
longer be restrained. The merriest peals&#xD;
came frok the pew of Judge Douglass.&#xD;
Helen, for a moment abashed at what she&#xD;

'rO N.&#xD;
&#xD;
regarded as an impropriety; cast a look at&#xD;
her father, who occupied the President's&#xD;
chair, and was horrified to see his fat&#xD;
sides shaking violently. Curious to wit-&#xD;
ness what effect the unrestrained hilarity&#xD;
of his most influential elder, had upon the&#xD;
clergyman, she looked in that direction,&#xD;
and discovered he had good-naturedly&#xD;
joine(I in the merriment which had be-&#xD;
come universal. Clifton ~ preserved&#xD;
his gravity, and was coolly looking over&#xD;
his notes until order was restored.&#xD;

obeys the word of God, and the heathen&#xD;
to whom its precepts ~nd commands are&#xD;
unknown, both enter. the kingdom of&#xD;
heaven, that salvation can surely be&#xD;
traced to the possession of knowledge by&#xD;
the one, and the want of it by the other.&#xD;
The first is saved because he keeps the&#xD;
commandments of his Maker; the last,&#xD;
because Divine goodness is un~villing to&#xD;
punish a mortal who ignorantly sins. If&#xD;
I am correct in these de Juctions, con-&#xD;
science is not a~ innate principle of the&#xD;
human mind, bpt in an enlightened ~om-&#xD;
munity has beeti confounded with know-&#xD;

"Can that which iS so thoroughly esta-&#xD;
blished by incontestable facts, require the&#xD;
support of metaphysical reasoning ~ A&#xD;
child, when it first beholds the light of&#xD;
day, is devoid of reason. and without&#xD;
possessing the strength, has only the in-&#xD;
stincts of the brute. Its mind is' a blank,&#xD;
but the germ of intelligence which Divine&#xD;
power has implanted in the mind, acquires&#xD;
strength as it expands, and is soon pre-&#xD;

essentially controlled by circumstances.&#xD;

bows to brazen images. Let that child&#xD;
grow to manhood within the borders of an&#xD;
enlightened community, and he feels the&#xD;
gentle influences of civilization. Rear&#xD;
him among cannibals, and he joins in theW&#xD;
disgusting orgies. The human mind can&#xD;
acquire the polish of the courtier or the&#xD;
roughness of the peasant-the peaceful&#xD;
habits of the Quaker, or the uncontrollable&#xD;
ferocity of the mercenary soldier. The&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
"For he was blithe as pence may be,&#xD;
Yct boisterous as victory."&#xD;
TEGNER.&#xD;
Tims Presidential contest of 1840 was&#xD;
being fought. The democracy were mak-&#xD;
irig a dignified canvass. They fiercely&#xD;
denounced the tactics of the Whig party,&#xD;
as an appeal to the passions, instead of&#xD;
the judgments of the populace. It was&#xD;
unavailino~; log cabins, hard cider, and&#xD;
coon skins, were the order of the day. It&#xD;
was madness to contend against the tide&#xD;
which was overwhelming the admihistra-&#xD;
tion. The symbols of the Whig party did&#xD;
not cause the excitement that pervaded&#xD;
every city and hamlet throughout the&#xD;
confederacy; they were only evidences of&#xD;
its existence. At most, it did not surpass&#xD;
the demonstrations which characterized&#xD;
the elevation of General Jackson to the&#xD;
Presidential chair. Whenever enthusiasm&#xD;
arouses the dormant powers of only one&#xD;
party, the other may look for the hand&#xD;
writing upon the wall.&#xD;
Too many persons like to go with the&#xD;
crowd, to make a reliance upon the~ ice&#xD;
of a cause any more available than a&#xD;
dignified discussion of principles.&#xD;
There was a whig barbecue in Stam-&#xD;
ford. The village was crowded with ladies&#xD;
and gentlemen, men and women. Car-&#xD;
riages, equestrians, and footmen, thronged&#xD;
every thoroughfare leading thither. The&#xD;
fairer portion of the assemblage wore&#xD;
ch~rm~.-.gold log cabins, and coral cider-&#xD;
barrels, were visible everywhere. Coon-&#xD;
skins, and the living ani al itself, were&#xD;
seen in the crowd. But t e chief object&#xD;
of attraction, was an immen e ball, scarcely&#xD;
less than twenty feet in di meter, elevat-&#xD;
ed upon wheels, with the names of the&#xD;
States printed upon it. his ball was&#xD;
turned upon an axis, and th gaping crowd&#xD;
looked with admiration u on its revolu-&#xD;
tions.&#xD;
"Will not these humb gs recoil upon&#xD;
the Whig party, and d~ve from their&#xD;
ranks, the sensible portion of it?" inqu ir-&#xD;
ed an old Democrat, w o watched the&#xD;
procession from Clifton's o ce.&#xD;
"I think not," responded our hero.&#xD;
"Observe the crowd for moment; the'&#xD;
respectable part do not, i is true, partici-&#xD;
pate in the orgies, never eless, they wit-&#xD;
ness them with a pleasing smile."&#xD;
"Yes," said Fielding;1 "look at old&#xD;
Judge Whiting, with what complacency&#xD;
he contemplates the revolutions' of the&#xD;
ball. Hear those Joe Bunkers, how they&#xD;
twirl their hats, and shout, as they sur-&#xD;
&#xD;
round the object of their idolatry. Ah ha,&#xD;
here comes a body of infantry, well drilled&#xD;
too. Altogether political, though; see the&#xD;
letters H. G, upon their knapsacks; they&#xD;
deploy with admirable precision. By the&#xD;
gods! there will be a difficulty. At each&#xD;
turn they approach nearer and nearer to&#xD;
the stalwart form of Col. Brown, who&#xD;
seems rooted to the spot, as he eyes them&#xD;
with implacable ferocity." But the Guards&#xD;
wefe discreet; there~were too many of the&#xD;
unterrifled democracy in the village.&#xD;
The whigs seemed wild with enthu-&#xD;
siasm. The humble occupant of a clerk's-&#xD;
office was transformec~ into a hero and a&#xD;
statesman, with the string of his dwelling&#xD;
always upon the oi$tside. It was a subject&#xD;
of remark, that persons who were deeply&#xD;
involved in debt were the most liberal in&#xD;
their subscriptions for partisan jubilees.&#xD;
The passage of the bankrupt-law, after the&#xD;
election of General Harrison, created the&#xD;
belief that there was a Masonic under-&#xD;
standing during the canvass, that all debts&#xD;
should be cancelled.&#xD;
The policy of Mr. Van Buren was as-&#xD;
sailed with the utmost ferocity. The de-&#xD;
falcations of Swartwout and Price; the tem-&#xD;
porizing letters of the Secretary of the Trea-&#xD;
sury to Harris, were all paraded in the&#xD;
whig journals.&#xD;
A few weeks after the whig barbecue,&#xD;
there ~vas a mass meeting of the demo-&#xD;
cracy in Stamford. The gathering was&#xD;
large, but there was no excitement, save&#xD;
what was created by the anticipated arri-&#xD;
val of General Jackson. The Circuit&#xD;
Court was in session, and the whig law-&#xD;
yers sought to dampen the enthusiasm by&#xD;
leering allusions to the "illustrious prede-&#xD;
cessor." At twelve o'clock th~ Ex-Presi-&#xD;
dent, accompanied by Goverr~or Carroll&#xD;
and Felix Grundy, entered the village,&#xD;
i~mid the joyous shouts of the multitude.&#xD;
The venerable hero, feeble and emaciated,&#xD;
took a chair in the parlour of the hotel.&#xD;
His frame was tremulous with age, yet&#xD;
there was still a fire in his eyes which&#xD;
awed his enemies, and caused the most&#xD;
reckless to approach the old warrior with&#xD;
a respectful bearing.&#xD;
"Ah! my old friend !" he exclaimed,&#xD;
as he warmly grasped the hand of Major&#xD;
Yates, ~ I have not seen you before since&#xD;
the Florida campaign. What do I hear?&#xD;
Have you deserted your colours and turn-&#xD;
ed whig? That will never do. We have&#xD;
overthrown one enemy, don't let us fight&#xD;
in opposing ranks~ in our old age. The&#xD;
tomb will soon claim us both; we must&#xD;
die with hearts true to the cause." The&#xD;
Major was visibly affected by the language&#xD;
&#xD;
of his chief. "Never fear, gentlemen;&#xD;
Major Yates will be with us on the day of&#xD;
election." Another veteran claimed his&#xD;
attention. "Really, I cannot recall your&#xD;
"Is it possible you have forgotten me,&#xD;
General ~ said the old man, as a tear&#xD;
stole along ~his cheek. "Alas! that the&#xD;
day should ever come! Do you not re-&#xD;
collect making your dinner of acorns, in&#xD;
the Creek ~&#xD;
"What! Corporal Ray! God bless you !"&#xD;
and the hero rose hastily, and with trem-&#xD;
bling hands embraced his humble follower.&#xD;
An electric thrill ran through the crowd.&#xD;
The commander held the subordinate at&#xD;
arms-length while he scanned his features.&#xD;
"It is Corporal Ray, but time has exerted&#xD;
his power upon you as well as me. Those&#xD;
were trials, Corporal, which tested the&#xD;
courage and patriotism of the soldiers !"&#xD;
"Indeed they were, General! espe-&#xD;
cially when our rations consisted of raw&#xD;
hides! But you shared i~n all our suffer-&#xD;
ings, you did! It was that alone which&#xD;
made us endure them."&#xD;
"That was my duty, you know."&#xD;
"But when the hides ~vere all gone,&#xD;
General, some of them didn't fancy your&#xD;
substitute."&#xD;
"What was that, Corporal ?"&#xD;
"Why, they thought that, although&#xD;
acorns were very good for hogs, they were&#xD;
rather poor fare for soldiers. They were&#xD;
determined to retreat but you stopped&#xD;
them, you did! Egad, they didn't know&#xD;
that the old musket was empty; ha! ha !"&#xD;
"We could neither of us go through&#xD;
another campaign like that, Corporal Ray."&#xD;
~ Sartin."&#xD;
"But do you still answer to the name&#xD;
of Democrat?"&#xD;
" Here ~ responded the old man as he&#xD;
raised his tall form with military 'quick-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
"I am glad to hear it, Corporal! I&#xD;
hope you will always remain true to your&#xD;
principles."&#xD;
"Not only myself, General, but six sons&#xD;
and twenty grandsons vote the Democratic&#xD;
ticket, anda dozen daughters and grand-&#xD;
daughters would vote the same way if&#xD;
they had the right."&#xD;
"I am glad to hear it! If the ladies&#xD;
cannot vote, they can use their influence."&#xD;
The General now retired to his room,&#xD;
quite exhausted by fatigue.&#xD;
Major Yates was sadly puzzled between&#xD;
affection for his old commander, and zeal&#xD;
for the cause which he had recently es-&#xD;
poused. As he was wending his way&#xD;
&#xD;
through the square, he met the Circuit&#xD;
Judge and several whig lawyers.&#xD;
CC I suppose, now, since you have seen&#xD;
Old Hickory, you are prepared to vote for&#xD;
the Kinderhook candidate ?" said the&#xD;
Judge.&#xD;
CC Of course he is !" replied one of the&#xD;
lawyers. CC Has not the edict gone forth&#xD;
from the Hermitage that Matty Van shall&#xD;
be elected? and, notwithstanding his&#xD;
grinding oppressions, it must be obeyed."&#xD;
"Perhaps you are wrong in your con-&#xD;
clusions," hesitatingly interposed Major&#xD;
Yates.&#xD;
"Certainly not," said another, we al-&#xD;
ways knew if General Jackson could once&#xD;
lay his eyes upon you, your right of thought&#xD;
xvou~l be gone! You never acted for&#xD;
yourself until you became a Whig. The&#xD;
hero of New Orleans does all the thinking&#xD;
for the Democrats-what little there is&#xD;
of it!"&#xD;
"Come, gentlemen, wait until you see&#xD;
how I vote."&#xD;
"Oh, we know that already! Your vote&#xD;
is good for the Oily Magician. You will&#xD;
swallow him, standing army and all !"&#xD;
"Never !" shouted the Major, and the&#xD;
Judge winked at his companions as they&#xD;
proceeded to their lodgings. Such is the&#xD;
power of ridicule!&#xD;
"I think, Judgewe are certain of the&#xD;
Major's vote."&#xD;
"Not a doubt of it! He is proud, and&#xD;
dislikes to have it said he is controlled by&#xD;
the old General."&#xD;
"And yet, he is no less a slave, for he&#xD;
is swerved from his principles by preju-&#xD;
dice and sarcasm..&#xD;
"All true; but we have nothing to do&#xD;
with that, you know. His vote and his&#xD;
influence is all we desire."&#xD;
"Is his influence considerable ?"&#xD;
"Undoubtedly. He is a leading man&#xD;
in his neighbourhood, and now, when so&#xD;
many persons are ready to desert the&#xD;
democratic standard, his defection is of&#xD;
incalculable importance.~~&#xD;
"It is singular that Clifton does not hold&#xD;
him to his allegiance; the Major has an&#xD;
exalted opinion of the Northerner."&#xD;
"He could if he w        his&#xD;
ould exert influ-&#xD;
ence; but he is quite as indifferent du-&#xD;
ring this campaign, as Scott's 'Black Slug-&#xD;
gard.~~~&#xD;
A feeling of apathy appeared to seize&#xD;
the ranks of the Democratic party. The&#xD;
Whigs, however, were active and enthu-&#xD;
siastic. Many of ther; v ,re disappointed&#xD;

grief, hundreds declared they would not&#xD;
vote for General Harrison. But warmed&#xD;
by the excitement ~which everywhere&#xD;
prevailed, they at length rallied under the&#xD;
banner of " Tippecanoe."&#xD;
These struggles always afford food for&#xD;
reflection. It is a matter of vital impor-&#xD;
tance that the elective franchise should be&#xD;
regarded as a glorious privilege. The&#xD;
right to select our own officers, was pur-&#xD;
chased by the blood of ~ir revolutionary&#xD;
sires. If its exercise is neglected, we lose&#xD;
all interest in the guardianship of a sacred&#xD;
trust. Every patriot should rejoice at the&#xD;
existence of political excitement, provided&#xD;
it does not trespass upon the boundaries of&#xD;
law and order. It indicates a healthy&#xD;
tone in public sentiment, and a cherished&#xD;
regard for the inalienable rights o~ the&#xD;
human family. It proves what is of far&#xD;
greater importance, that there is a due&#xD;
appreciation of the privileges which are&#xD;
guaranteed by the Constitution of the&#xD;
United States, and a determination to&#xD;
maintain them at every hazard.&#xD;
There is one amendment that could&#xD;
very properly be made to the Constitution&#xD;
of the United States. The candidates&#xD;
for President and Vice President should&#xD;
be voted for directly. The electoral col-&#xD;
lege is unnecessary, and might become&#xD;
dangerous. Instances are not rare, of&#xD;
members of Congress, proving recreant to&#xD;
the trust reposed in them by their consti-&#xD;
tuents. Elected as Anti-Bank candidates,&#xD;
their virtue often yielded to the power of&#xD;
that Institution, and when too late, politi-&#xD;
cal treachery was punished by political&#xD;
oblivion. Although the electoral colleges&#xD;
have hitherto faithfully executed their&#xD;
trust, still they are but men. In a Presi-&#xD;
dential contest, resulting in almost a drawn&#xD;
battle, the electors of a State might prove&#xD;
traitors, and by electing that aspirant who&#xD;
is entitled only to a minority of the electo-&#xD;
ral college, although he might have re-&#xD;
ceived a majority of votes in the ag~re-&#xD;
gate, they would plunge the country into&#xD;
the horrors of civil war. No reason can&#xD;
be assigned for employing the agency ofi&#xD;
the electoral college. It is the aristocratic&#xD;
feature of the Constitution. It is without'&#xD;
any practical good whatever, and might&#xD;
prove the destruction of the American&#xD;
Union. Let every voter deposit in the&#xD;
ballot-box, th~ names of the candidate for&#xD;
President and Vice President of the United&#xD;
States, and then no danger can be appre-&#xD;
herided from fraud and treachery.&#xD;

"Some men are born great; some achieve greatness;&#xD;
Some have greatness thrust upon them."&#xD;
SEARSPEAItE.&#xD;
"A shade Is an omen, a dream is a sign."&#xD;
LANDON.&#xD;
A SPACE of thirty miles intervened be-&#xD;
tween Stamford and Bergen, the capital of&#xD;
the adjacent county. The road thither,&#xD;
for a distance of ten miles, led through a&#xD;
rich and fertile region; it then diverged&#xD;
from the river, and, winding through the&#xD;
hills for a dozen miles, descended into the&#xD;
valley of Silver Creek, where elegant&#xD;
mansions and ~picturesque cottages at-&#xD;
tested the prosperity of the husbandman.&#xD;
Nothing could be more gloomy and deso-&#xD;
late than the waste which extended be-&#xD;
tween these two streams. The scanty soil&#xD;
was sparsely covered with stunted oak&#xD;
and black jack, and afforded a painful&#xD;
contrast to the majestic forest trees that&#xD;
here and there towered upon the water-&#xD;
courses. In certain localities, however,&#xD;
Nature had been more indulgent. There&#xD;
the trees had acquired a greater height,&#xD;
and entwining their ample limbs in closer&#xD;
embrace, cast an inviting shade upop ~he&#xD;
earth. Grape-vines, which are indigenous&#xD;
to the soil, sought these favoured spots,&#xD;
and clustering together, assisted in making&#xD;
the bower sufficiently attractive to tempt&#xD;
the wayfarer, when the sun rode high in&#xD;
the heavens, to rest himself beneath the&#xD;
umbrageous foliage.&#xD;
On a bright morning, Freeman and&#xD;
Clifton mounted their steeds, and started&#xD;
for Bergen, for the purpose of attending&#xD;
the coflrt, which was to be held there the&#xD;
following day.&#xD;
"Let us~ get a drink of water at this&#xD;
spring," said the former.&#xD;
"Whose residence is this ?" inquired&#xD;
Edward.&#xD;
"'Tis a plantation belonging to General&#xD;
Foster! Here, Pete," calling to a negro,&#xD;
who was lounging upon a log, "come&#xD;
here, you ace of spades, and help this&#xD;
gentleman and myself to some water !"&#xD;
"Yah, yah! that I will Massa Ben,"&#xD;
said the man cheerfully. "Shall I go ask&#xD;
Miss Ellen for a cup, or will you take de&#xD;
gourds"&#xD;
"Oh, the gourd will do. Stay! your&#xD;
young mistress is calling you."&#xD;
As the African reached the balcony, a&#xD;
silver cup was extended towards him by&#xD;
a fair hand; the vines were for a moment&#xD;
parted, and both gentlemen raised their&#xD;
hats, and bowed to the graceful inclina-&#xD;
tion of the young damsel.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Massa Ben mussent spose de cup is&#xD;
sent cause him want to drink."&#xD;
"Why not, you black scoundrels" rais-&#xD;
ing his whip.&#xD;
The negro leaped actively upon one&#xD;
side, "Yah, yah. cause him callers use&#xD;
gourd afore !"&#xD;
"For whom was it sent, then ~"&#xD;
"Why, Massa Ben, you Jorrier, and&#xD;
ought to know, if it never sent to him afore,&#xD;
when he go alone, and it be sent now,&#xD;
when emblem wid him, that it be sent&#xD;
for gemblem, and not for Massa Ben ;"&#xD;
and elated with his logic, the slave re-&#xD;
mained a moment upon his head, with&#xD;
his heels dangling in the air, until receiv-&#xD;
ing a smart cut from Freeman's whip, he&#xD;
turned a somerset7 and burst forth into&#xD;
loud peals of laughter.&#xD;
"Who is this little divinity l" inquired&#xD;
Clifton, after they had res~imed their jour-&#xD;
ney.&#xD;
"She is the only daughter of a gentle-&#xD;
man, who, once engaged in the mercan-&#xD;
tile business, has now retired with a large&#xD;
fortune. The young lady possesses supe-&#xD;
rior endowments, and rare beauty, which,&#xD;
when fully developed, will render her one&#xD;
of the loveliest of her sex. By the way,&#xD;
as your office overlooks her father's&#xD;
grounds, you must have seen her before."&#xD;
"I believe I have. But whither does&#xD;
the road now take us ~" and they entered&#xD;
upon the drear and barren region which I&#xD;
have already described.&#xD;
About midway of this waste, there is a&#xD;
curve in the road, forming an angle of&#xD;
about forty-five degrees. In the bend&#xD;
were the inouldering walls of what had&#xD;
once been a capacious dwelling. It was&#xD;
now almost entirely concealed from sight,&#xD;
by' a dense thicket, which was rarely&#xD;
penetrated by the superstitious, who were&#xD;
kept aloof by traditions that connected&#xD;
tales of violence and death, with the di-&#xD;
lapidated building.&#xD;
As our travellers approached this spot,&#xD;
they saw before them, seated upon the&#xD;
trunk ofafallentreeahunter, who scanned&#xD;
their persons with a savage look~ He re-&#xD;
mained seated, however, with his long&#xD;
rifle resting upon his knees. As they&#xD;
turned involuntary in their saddles, he re-&#xD;
treated into the bushes, and was concealed&#xD;
from their view.&#xD;
"I like not the appearance of that&#xD;
vagabond,~7 observed Freeman; "he has&#xD;
too much the appearance of a brigand."&#xD;
"What is the reputation of the neigh-&#xD;
borhood V'&#xD;
"Why, bad enough! About three miles&#xD;
hence, and, I believe, in the direction&#xD;
&#xD;
which he took, there are several families&#xD;
who live by theft, and if I am not greatly&#xD;
/&#xD;
deceived, this fellow is one of the gang.&#xD;
At all events, I should not regard our posi-&#xD;
tion as perfectly safe, provided he bore a&#xD;
double-barrelled gun instead of a rifle,&#xD;
while we are within its range."&#xD;
"But he has vanished in the forest,"&#xD;
responded Edward.&#xD;
"True, but it is not at all improbable&#xD;
that the thicket contains a blind, cutfor&#xD;
the purpose of letting the bullet seek its&#xD;
victim, as well as to enable the murderer&#xD;
to scan the road in both directions."&#xD;
At the close of the day, the travellers&#xD;
entered the i~illage of Bergen, and alight-&#xD;
ed at the principal hotel. After directing&#xD;
the hostler how to groom their steeds, they&#xD;
entered the drawing-room, where they&#xD;
found most of the lawyers who attended&#xD;
the court, listening to the anecdotes of the&#xD;
merry Judge who presided over the cir-&#xD;
cuit. With the latter, as well as with&#xD;
nearly all the fraternity, Clifton was ac-&#xD;
quainted! Freeman and himself, therefore,&#xD;
were received with that warmthh and cor-&#xD;
diality which marks the intercourse be-&#xD;
tween members of the bar, at the South&#xD;
and West.&#xD;

SHAKSPEARE.&#xD;
THE next morning the court "met pur-&#xD;
suant to adjournment.~~ Jurors, witnesses,&#xD;
clients, and spectators, had gathered, in&#xD;
carriages and on horseback. The first&#xD;
day of court is always one of great in-&#xD;
terest in the interior, and to the disinte-&#xD;
rested observer, affords much amusement.&#xD;
The names of the jurors are written upon&#xD;
separate pieces of paper, and placed in a&#xD;
hat, from whence thirteen are withdrawn,&#xD;
by a child under ten years of age, and&#xD;
constitute the grand jury. This inquest,&#xD;
then, with open mouths, receive a charge&#xD;
from the court. Its constant repetition be-&#xD;
comes irksome to the Judge, and conscious,&#xD;
perhaps, that they will more readily com-&#xD;
prehend the isolated cases presented by&#xD;
the attomey-general, for their conside-&#xD;
ration, than a complicated charge, he fre-&#xD;
quently delegates his prerogative to some&#xD;
junior member of the bar.&#xD;
While the court is empannelling the&#xD;
grand jury, clients eagerly gather round&#xD;

"Prate you of their justice? why, in&#xD;

while on notes it extends to $500. Have&#xD;

cause the rights of litigants can be intrust-&#xD;

to a jury."&#xD;
"Butyou surely would not withhold&#xD;
the right of trial by jury, in criminal&#xD;
cases~" inquired Clifton.&#xD;
"That is another question, which I will&#xD;
not discuss !" remarked him they called&#xD;
'little Bilious,' as he resumed his seat.&#xD;
The company now became exceeding&#xD;
merry, with the exception of Edward&#xD;
who although not a temperance lecturer,&#xD;
chose, upon this occasion, to remain in a&#xD;
condition to ~observe one of those frolics,&#xD;
which the members of the bar sometimes&#xD;
indulged in, a few years ago. Anecdote&#xD;
followed anecdote, in rapid succession,&#xD;
while the glass went merrily round. Now&#xD;
each one, would mingle in the mglbe, and&#xD;
assail and defend himself, where all were&#xD;
his foes. Anon, some unfortunate wight&#xD;

his cheeks, attested the power of that&#xD;
mental torture to which he was subjected.&#xD;
Opposing the onslaught with all the skill&#xD;
and patience which he could command,&#xD;
the writhing victim waited until some&#xD;
happy retort, or unexpected diversion,&#xD;
turned the warfare in another direction.&#xD;
No rudeness was exhibited, and the only&#xD;
weapons employed were wit and sar~&#xD;
casm.&#xD;
"Did you ever hear the scene described&#xD;
which occurred at the last session of the&#xD;
court at Stamford, Col. Morton l" inquired-&#xD;
Major Henderson.&#xD;
"Never; let us hear it," replied that&#xD;
gentleman, who resided in another cir-&#xD;
cuit.&#xD;
"Our young friends, Freeman, Grayson,&#xD;
and Clarendon, were seated late at night&#xD;
in the office of the former, when Clifton&#xD;
entered, and with his serious manner in-&#xD;
formed them that a lady, evidently de-&#xD;
ranged, had taken possession of his office.&#xD;
Grayson returned with him, and entering&#xD;
the office with a cigar in his mouth, saw&#xD;
a female, elegantly attired, walking up&#xD;
and down the office with rapid strides.&#xD;
No sooner had he placed his feet upon the&#xD;
floor, than the maniac darted toward him,&#xD;
exclaiming, 'How dare you enter my pre-&#xD;
sence with a cigars' With a bound that&#xD;
deposited him in the mud, Grayson eluded&#xD;
her grasp, but did not cease his flight un-&#xD;
til he was safely ensconced in Freeman's&#xD;
officewhere he expatiated upon the fiery&#xD;
impetuosity of the maniac.&#xD;
"'Come, gentlemen,' said Clarendon,&#xD;
discontentedly, 'we must not leave Clifton&#xD;
alone with this turbulent woman. Let us&#xD;
all go up.'&#xD;
"Scarcely had they congregated around&#xD;
the door, when the enraged female seized&#xD;
a chair, which she wielded with the strength&#xD;
of a man, and advanced furiously upon&#xD;
them. The three cavaliers commenced a&#xD;
simultaneous retreat, which, however, was&#xD;
not conducted with sufficient speed. They&#xD;
had not accomplished half the distance&#xD;
upon their return, when Freeman was&#xD;
grasped by the coat and twirled around&#xD;
so suddenly, that. losing his equilibrium,&#xD;
he was deposited upon his back in a pool&#xD;
of water. Clarendon suffered his hat to&#xD;
fall, and before he could recover it the&#xD;
crown was burst in by the excited female.&#xD;
Gray son, who had remained in the rear&#xD;
of the attacking party, managed to reach&#xD;
Freeman's office without being subjected&#xD;
to another assault, and closed and bolted&#xD;
the door as soon as the others succeeded&#xD;
in making their escape.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8086-00000041"/>&#xD;
92                  CLIFTON.                                                CLIFTON.                  93&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Did you ever see such a swingecat V&#xD;
whispered Clarendon, 'see, she has utterly&#xD;
destroyed my beaver!'&#xD;
"'And what tremendous strength she&#xD;
possesses!' replied Freeman. 'Her height&#xD;
is not less than that of an Amazon!'&#xD;
"'What will become of Clifton V asked&#xD;
Grayson.&#xD;
"'I don't know,' said Freeman; 'these&#xD;
are times when the doctrine of self-preser-&#xD;
vation is omnipotent!'&#xD;
~C ~Besides,~ remarked Clarendon, 'be-&#xD;
ing exempt. by reason of her infirmity,&#xD;
from the ordinary punishment'-.&#xD;
Here he was interrupted by a violent&#xD;
effort to force the door.&#xD;
"'By the gods! she is jtfter us!' said&#xD;
Grayson, in a whisper; 'preserve silence,&#xD;
and she may think we have escaped. Is&#xD;
your window secured V At this moment&#xD;
the maniac stealthily run her hand along&#xD;
the sash, and Clarendon, who was stand-&#xD;
ing with his back in close proximity to it,&#xD;
raised himself upon his toes, and turning&#xD;
round with an agitated look, gazed upon&#xD;
the curtain. Again the door was violently&#xD;
shaken.&#xD;
"'If she succeeds in entering,~ said&#xD;
Gmayson, 'we must knock her down with&#xD;
a chair! I would rather encounter twenty&#xD;
men than one deranged woman!'&#xD;
"'Yes; but we have nothing to tie her&#xD;
with after she is down,' replied Freeman,&#xD;
discontentedly.&#xD;
"'Here are my suspenders,' quickly ob-&#xD;
served Clarendon.&#xD;
"'Can't we make our escape out of the&#xD;
back-window V&#xD;
"'No; she will discover us, and then we&#xD;
have no protection, for you will remember&#xD;
she is exceedingly fleet of foot.'&#xD;
"'Let us send for the constable! he is&#xD;
paid for encountering danger.~&#xD;
"'Agreed! that is a good suggestion!&#xD;
bqut who shall go for him V A pause suc~&#xD;
needed. At length Freeman magnani-&#xD;
mously replied-&#xD;
"'I will encounter the danger; but if I&#xD;
am seized you must come to the rescue.'&#xD;
"'We'll do it!' and Freeman leaped&#xD;
from the back-window, and cut the air&#xD;
' with rapid strides in the direction of the&#xD;
constable's office.&#xD;
"The attack upon the door now ceased,&#xD;
and the most profound silence ensued.&#xD;
Cautiously looking out through the win.&#xD;
dow, they discovered the maniac walking&#xD;
calmly along between Clifton and Dr.&#xD;
Fielding, and the merry laughter of the&#xD;
trio rang clearly upon the night-air.&#xD;
"'We have been sold!' muttered Cla-&#xD;
rendon; 'but let us see' the end of it.'&#xD;
&#xD;
"Fielding paused at the door of young&#xD;
Palmer's room, while Edward and the&#xD;
lady entered~ 'Here is a lady, Palmer,&#xD;
whom I found in the street. She is evi-&#xD;
dently a stranger, and quite ill; will you&#xD;
suffer her to remain until I can obtain&#xD;
medical assistance V and closing the door,&#xD;
he vanished.&#xD;
"Palmer-the most particular arid sen-&#xD;
sitive of men-was much confused~ at ha-&#xD;
ving a~ young damsel in his apartment,&#xD;
yet, touched with pity, asked her if she&#xD;
would not rest herself upon his sofa. As&#xD;
he was supporting her thither, Fielding&#xD;
entered the room, but immediately com-&#xD;
menced apologizing for the untimely in-&#xD;
trusion, when he was interrupted by&#xD;
Palmer, who passionately exclaimed&#xD;
'Good God! man, don't make a d-d fool&#xD;
of yourself! Clifton will be back in a&#xD;
moment.' Convulsed with laughter,&#xD;
Fielding remarked, 'Here is Clifton, now,&#xD;
but in the act of passing your room.'&#xD;
Rushing to the door, Palmer, now highly&#xD;
excited, inquired of Edward why he had&#xD;
not returned for the lady sooner.&#xD;
"'What lady V replied he, 'I have seen&#xD;
none.'&#xD;
"Before the explosion occurred which&#xD;
would have followed this remark, foot-&#xD;
steps were heard rapidly traversing the&#xD;
street, and Freeman and the constable ap-&#xD;
proached them.&#xD;
"'Where is she V eagerly inquired&#xD;
Freeman of Edward. 'There! there she&#xD;
is! constable, seize ~'&#xD;
"The officer was about to advance,&#xD;
when a lad exclaimed, with evidentterror,&#xD;
"'Don't hurt her; she is Cousin Wil-&#xD;
liam!"'&#xD;
This anecdote was frequently interrupt-&#xD;
ed by laughter.&#xD;
"It is two o'clock, ~ remarked the&#xD;
Judge, who was master of ceremonies,&#xD;
"and it is time to adjourn. We must first&#xD;
have a dance from Grayson and Col. Mor-&#xD;
ton. Come, Henderson shall be the arbi-&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
Clarendon took the violin, and after a&#xD;
brief prelude, commenced a "negro break-&#xD;
down." The competitors presented the&#xD;
most striking contrast. Morton was a tall,&#xD;
slender person, about forty-five years of&#xD;
age, with only sufficient flesh upon his&#xD;
bones to redeem his form from the charge&#xD;
of emaciation. There was something&#xD;
inimically droll in his manner, as he took&#xD;
off his coat, rolled up his sleeves, and ran&#xD;
his long slender fingers through his hair.&#xD;
Gray son, on the contrary, possessed an&#xD;
Herculean frame, and could scarcely weigh&#xD;
&#xD;
less than two hundred and twenty-five&#xD;
pounds.&#xD;
The dance commenced, and no one who&#xD;
has never witnessed the gyrations of a&#xD;
negro, can imagine the convolutions which&#xD;
the forms of Morton and Grayson were&#xD;
made to assume and the applause was&#xD;
enthusiastic as they seated themselves,&#xD;
panting from the exertion.&#xD;
"The Court will briefly refer to the&#xD;
merits of the performance which has just&#xD;
been given for .our amusement," remarked&#xD;
Henderson. "The youthful vigour of Mr.&#xD;
Grayson inclined the Court to look fa-&#xD;
vourably upon his feats, notwithstanding&#xD;
the science displayed by his veteran com-&#xD;
petitor. The Court wo~~Jd have been com-&#xD;
pelled so to adjudge, and was preparing&#xD;
to do so, when its opinion was changed;&#xD;
and 1 am now compelled to decide in fa-&#xD;
vour of Col. Morton; a triumph for which&#xD;
he is indebted to the last flourish of his&#xD;
left foot."&#xD;
"Bravo! a glorious decision! A second&#xD;
Daniel !" shouted all; and with uncertain&#xD;
steps they sought their several apartments.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
"Is that a~dagger which I see before me,&#xD;
The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch&#xD;
thee:-&#xD;
I have thee not, and yet IL see thee still.&#xD;
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible&#xD;
To feeling, as to sight? or art thou but&#xD;
A dagger of the mind, a false creation&#xD;
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain ?"&#xD;
SHARSPEARE.&#xD;
ON the following night, Clifton was&#xD;
seated in his room, when Freeman en-&#xD;
tered~ unceremoniously.&#xD;
"I have to request of you the ~&#xD;
he observed, "to assume the manage-&#xD;
ment of my causes during the term, as I&#xD;
have been summoned, unexpectedly, to&#xD;
~ Edward; "but I regret&#xD;
that I shall deprived of your company&#xD;
on my ~&#xD;
"It is now impossible; you may re-&#xD;
member that I was retained to defend&#xD;
Maxwell, whenever he was arrested. That&#xD;
event has now occurred, and my departure&#xD;
in the morning is unavoidable. But who&#xD;
was that'?" he exclaimed, looking eagerly&#xD;
at the window.&#xD;
saw no one."&#xD;
"Unless an imaginary phantom crossed&#xD;
my vision, I beheld the forbidding counte-&#xD;
&#xD;
nance of the hunter vanish in the gloom, as&#xD;
I spoke."&#xD;
"Doubtless it proceeded from the ex-&#xD;
cesses of last night."&#xD;
"It may be so," replied the other,&#xD;
shaking his head. "But farewell; I start&#xD;
early."&#xD;
"Good bye, Freeman! Do not let your&#xD;
thoughts dwell upon brigands, thickets,&#xD;
and mouldering dwellings.~~&#xD;
The door closed upon the receding form&#xD;
of his friend.&#xD;
"He is evidently disturbed. Can there&#xD;
be, danger'? If I thought so, I would ac-&#xD;
company him," soliloquised our* hero.&#xD;
"But no! it was only the phantom pro-&#xD;
duced by wine, and a want of sleep."&#xD;
As Freeman left Edward's roofri, a man&#xD;
stealthily retreated from, the window~ be-&#xD;
neath which he had crouched, and with&#xD;
his dark aud scowling countenance turned&#xD;
backwards, occasionally, to ascertain if he&#xD;
was pursued, he glided to~vards the forest&#xD;
which skirted the village. Apparently, he&#xD;
sought unsuccessfully for some object, for&#xD;
he uttered curses, smothered but deep.&#xD;
The sky was overcast with clouds, and the&#xD;
earth was shrouded in darkness, which&#xD;
served as a barrier to his vision.&#xD;
"Where could I have left them i" he&#xD;
muttered; l~it was certainly somewhere&#xD;
hereaway, and if these cursed clouds&#xD;
would lift, I could find them."&#xD;
But the impenetrable gloom continued,&#xD;
and at length, seating himself in despair&#xD;
upon the earth, he exclaimed, "If this&#xD;
continues long, the game will escape me,&#xD;
for I must be at the stand before daylight,&#xD;
or else I may be seen, and the hounds of&#xD;
justice will be upon my footsteps !"&#xD;
An hour of absolute torture to the robber&#xD;
now passed, when a breeze sprang up&#xD;
which lifted the clouds, and twinkling&#xD;
stars sparkled through the trees. Renew-&#xD;
ing the sea-inch, which now proved suc,-&#xD;
cessful, he found his horse and rifle,, and&#xD;
mounting the steed, he entered a narrow&#xD;
path, which at a distance of two miles&#xD;
terminated in the highway leading from&#xD;
Bergen to Stamford.&#xD;
Freeman partook of an early breakfast,&#xD;
and started homeward. The clear skies&#xD;
and bracing air of autumn buoyed, his&#xD;
spirits, and he wended his way onwards,&#xD;
with that hopeful confidence which is the&#xD;
heritage of youth. As he ascended the&#xD;
hill at the head of Silver Creek, and ad-&#xD;
vancing into the waste, approached the&#xD;
spot so much dreaded by travellers, he&#xD;
paused for a moment, and considered the&#xD;
propriety of diverging from the road, when*&#xD;
herefi~ted that if his companions were&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8086-00000042"/>&#xD;
CLIFTON.               95&#xD;
&#xD;
94                   CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
apprised of the detour, it would afford&#xD;
them aim opportunity of amusing them-&#xD;
selves at his expense, and he proceeded&#xD;
steadily onwards. His spirited horse be-&#xD;
came restive, and betrayed an indisposi~'&#xD;
tion to pass the crumbling walls, when&#xD;
Freeman applied the spur to his flanks.&#xD;
Dashing forward with an aifrighted snort,&#xD;
and shrinking upon the opposite side of&#xD;
the road, he had nearly passed the thicket,&#xD;
when from its hidden recess issued a&#xD;
bright flame, which was instantaneously&#xD;
followed by the sharp report of a rifle.&#xD;
Freeman, for a moment, bent to the&#xD;
saddle, and then rallying his energies, he&#xD;
grasped wildly at the reins for a fleetitig&#xD;
instant, whei{ his limbs relaxed, his head&#xD;
sunk upon his bosom, and he fell power-&#xD;
less to the earth. The ball had pierced&#xD;
his brain, and the soul of the generous&#xD;
young man was wending its way to the&#xD;
world of spirits. The robber emerged&#xD;
from the wood, and casting, an anxioi~s&#xD;
glance along the road, seized the body&#xD;
and dragging it iiito the bushes, upon the&#xD;
opposite side, proceeded to rifle the&#xD;
pockets. This accomplished, he left the&#xD;
body exposed to beasts of prey and the&#xD;
storms of heaven, and seizing his rifle,&#xD;
plunged into the hidden recessed of the&#xD;
forest.&#xD;
The court had adjourned, and Edward&#xD;
was on his way to Stamford, musing upon&#xD;
the events of the week, and suffering his&#xD;
mind to erect castles in the air, when his&#xD;
attention was attracted by a large flock of&#xD;
buzzards, that, alarmed by his presence,&#xD;
started from the ground a short distance&#xD;
from the road, and were clumsily ascend-&#xD;
ing through the trees, the branches of&#xD;
which often came in contact with their&#xD;
huge wings.' Glancing around him, Clifton&#xD;
discovered that he was opposite the spot&#xD;
which had so strongly excited the suspi-&#xD;
cions of Freeman. With a vague and irre-&#xD;
pressible thrill of terror, he recollected the&#xD;
apprehensions of his friend, and parting&#xD;
the shrubbery that bordered the highway,&#xD;
forced his unwilling horse in the direction&#xD;
of the spot from whence the birds had&#xD;
ascended, and gazed upon the object be-&#xD;
fore him, horror-stricken and appalled.&#xD;
From the clothing, alone, did he recog-&#xD;
nise the body of4'reeman, and the blood&#xD;
congealed in his veins as his sight turned&#xD;
upon the eyeless sockets, and fleshless&#xD;
face, which indicated that the buzzards&#xD;
had claimed their prey.&#xD;
"Great God! is it thus that the mortal&#xD;
career of this honourable and gifted man is&#xD;
to terminate'? But he shall be avenged!&#xD;
I'll follow upon the footsteps of his mur-&#xD;
&#xD;
derer, until justice is satisfied; ay, fully,&#xD;
completely satisfied !"&#xD;
Dismounting, Edward covered thebody&#xD;
with bushes, so as to protect it from&#xD;
further desecration, and then putting spurs&#xD;
to his horse he dashed furiously onwards.&#xD;
As he was passing the country residence&#xD;
of General Foster, a slave arrested his&#xD;
headlong speed, and informed him that his&#xD;
young mistress desired to see him. Tutn-&#xD;
ing the head of his panting horse in the di-&#xD;
rection of the balcony, he was accosted by&#xD;
the young girl.&#xD;
"I trust you will pardon me for address-&#xD;
ing a stranger to whom I have never be~en&#xD;
formally introduced (arid her eyes fell fur&#xD;
a moment), but my father, who is una-&#xD;
voidably absent, requested me to inform&#xD;
you that the horse of Mr. Freeman passed&#xD;
lThre this morning, without saddle or bridle&#xD;
upon him. He fears that some fatal acci-&#xD;
dent may have happened to him !"&#xD;
"Fatal indeed !" responded Edward, " for&#xD;
he has been murdered by a highwayman."&#xD;
"Good heavens! can it he possible '?"&#xD;
and her hitherto blushing cheek became&#xD;
suddenly pale.&#xD;
"Tell General Foster, on his return, that&#xD;
the body of Freeman lies opposite the old&#xD;
dwelling, some five miles hence. You&#xD;
know its locality'?"&#xD;
"I do !" she replied, with a shudder.&#xD;
"Let him dispatch his Servants to guard&#xD;
it, while I summon the coroner from Stam-&#xD;
ford, and place the officers of justice upon&#xD;
the track of the murderer." And bidding&#xD;
her adieu, he was at Stamford within the&#xD;
half hour.&#xD;
The coroner was soon on the road, with&#xD;
Dr. Fielding and twelve others, while&#xD;
Clifton, with a constable, empowered to&#xD;
arrest all persons upon whom suspicion&#xD;
might fall, and half-a-dozen resolute men,&#xD;
were ready to start the next morning. At&#xD;
the time of the coroner's arrival night had&#xD;
set in; but they were prepared with torch-&#xD;
lights, and he proceeded at once to em-&#xD;
pannel the jury. In the awful presence of&#xD;
the dead, the preparations were peculiarly&#xD;
solemn. Fielding ascertained that the&#xD;
ball entered the back part of the head, and&#xD;
traversing the brain, passed out through&#xD;
the forehead, causing almost instant death.&#xD;
The jury were unable to form any con-&#xD;
jecture as to who committed the fatal&#xD;
deed, and rendered a verdict accordingly.&#xD;
The remains were then re~noved to Stam-&#xD;
ford, for interment, where the melancholy&#xD;
procession arrived about midnight. A&#xD;
gloom was cast over the village by the&#xD;
sudden death~of Freeman; for wherever&#xD;
he was known it was but to be admired.&#xD;
&#xD;
Emy Davidson was passing the evening&#xD;
with Helen Douglass and Virginia Drayton.&#xD;
They were seated around the hickory fire&#xD;
which was blazing in the parlour, when&#xD;
Margaret Fisher rushed into the room with&#xD;
~ an aifrighted countenance.&#xD;
"Why, what is the matter, Mag~"&#xD;
" The most terrible event has occurred&#xD;
which you can possibly conceive. The&#xD;
recollection of it makes my blood congeal&#xD;
with horror !"&#xD;
"Speak out! do not keep us longer in&#xD;
suspense."&#xD;
"Well, would you believe iC? Col. Free-&#xD;
man has been murdered !"&#xD;
~CImpossible ~ they all exclaimed, start-&#xD;
ing to their feet.&#xD;
"Indeed, it is too true. Mr. Clifton&#xD;
found the body upon his return from&#xD;
court'?"&#xD;
"Is not this horrible, William'?" said&#xD;
Miss Davidson to her brother, who now&#xD;
entered the room.&#xD;
"Yes, but blood for blood! Freeman&#xD;
shall not go unavenged. I have come to&#xD;
bid you adieu, as I have joined Clifton's&#xD;
party, which leaves early to-morrow&#xD;
morning in search of the robber."&#xD;
"Is Mr. Clifton so much interested'?"&#xD;
inquired Miss Drayton.&#xD;
"I never saw a person more agitated&#xD;
than he was, when he first dashed into the&#xD;
village, with his horse covered with foam.&#xD;
But now the coroner has taken his de-&#xD;
parture, and our party is arranged for to-&#xD;
morrow, he has quieted down into a calm&#xD;
and gloomy determination."&#xD;
~ strange,'~ she responded, musing-&#xD;
~ly, "that his feelings are so thoroughly&#xD;
aroused. His impulses must be warm&#xD;
and generous.~~&#xD;
The day had scarcely dawned, when&#xD;
Edward and his party were in the saddle,&#xD;
and before the sun had ascended suffi-&#xD;
ciently high to dry up the dew which clus-&#xD;
tered upon the leaves, they had congre-&#xD;
gated around the old dwelling. Clifton&#xD;
briefly related the scene ~vhich occurred at&#xD;
the spot when himself and the unfortu-&#xD;
nate victim were on their way to Bergen,&#xD;
and expressed the conviction that the&#xD;
hunter was the individual who had com-&#xD;
mitted the murder. It was important,&#xD;
therefore, in his opinion, that immediate&#xD;
and careful se rch should be made for his&#xD;
footsteps. Dis counting from their horses,&#xD;
they each descent d to t e task with the&#xD;
most untiring zeal.&#xD;
"I the patch of the ball, Mr. Clif-&#xD;
ton," triumphantly exclaimed young Da-&#xD;
vidson. They gathered around, and ascer-&#xD;
tained that ft had been used for that pur-&#xD;
&#xD;
pose, having been torn from an old cotton&#xD;
handkerchief.&#xD;
"Preserve that," said Edward.&#xD;
The y were now interrupted by a shout&#xD;
from the thicket, and approaching it, they&#xD;
ascertained that Flemino~ a celebrated&#xD;
hunter and trapper, had round the stand&#xD;
of the murderer.&#xD;
"Do you see this'?" he exclaimed; "he&#xD;
has cut the branches away, and removed&#xD;
the vines, so as to look up and down the&#xD;
road."&#xD;
~ strangem~ soliloquised Edward,&#xD;
"that Freeman should have suggested the&#xD;
probability Qf such an arrangement. This&#xD;
indeed bears the semblance of premoni-&#xD;
tion. Are there any footsteps visible'?" he&#xD;
inquired of Fleming.&#xD;
"I can't see any yet; the ground ap-&#xD;
pears too much trampled. Stay, this&#xD;
looks like one. Yes, here he has passed,~~&#xD;
he continued, eagerly, after a moment's&#xD;
exarrfination of the earth. "Now let me&#xD;
measure this track; it may serve to iden-&#xD;
tify the scoundrel." And he took the&#xD;
dimensions of a long and ill-shaped im-&#xD;
pression, which the desperado had made&#xD;
in the sand. Trusting in the experieIlce&#xD;
of the trapper, the party now followed the&#xD;
trail. It descended the slope of the hill,&#xD;
and was lost upon its rocky surface. For&#xD;
a long time the search for it was unavail-&#xD;
ing, until young Davidson descended into&#xD;
the channel of a brook, and upon the soft&#xD;
earth again discovered it.&#xD;
"What have we here'?" he exclaimed.&#xD;
Stooping for a moment he raised a hat&#xD;
from the bed of the stream, whither it had&#xD;
been sunk.&#xD;
"It is Freeman's !" exclaimed half a&#xD;
dozen voices.&#xD;
"Another link in the chain of evidence&#xD;
~vhich we are unfolding," muttered Ed-&#xD;
ward.&#xD;
The party now proceeded with great&#xD;
rapidity, and at the distance of three miles&#xD;
from the highway emerged from the forest&#xD;
into the open land. Pausing in the bor-&#xD;
der of the wood, they discovered, about&#xD;
forty rods from them, a log house, the in-&#xD;
mates of which were not yet stirring.&#xD;
After a brief consultation it was decided&#xD;
that Fleming and Clifton should proceed&#xD;
alone to the house. It was apprehended&#xD;
that a greater number would excite sus-&#xD;
picion, and the proof of his guilt might&#xD;
be destroyed by the murderer, if, as they&#xD;
anticipated, he was within the dwelling.&#xD;
For the same reason the constable re-&#xD;
inained behind, as it was quite probable&#xD;
his person was known to the criminal.&#xD;
Fleming had been appointed a deputy&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC8086-00000043"/>&#xD;
C&#xD;
&#xD;
96                           CLI]&#xD;
for the occasion,, and Edward decided to&#xD;
accompany him, for the purpose of iden-&#xD;
tifying the hunter. Exchanging coats&#xD;
with one of the humble members of the&#xD;
party, for the purpose of quieting the&#xD;
apprehensions of the felon, and directing&#xD;
them to follow the valley which descend-&#xD;
ed to the right of the house, and in close&#xD;
proximity to it, Clifton concluded his in-&#xD;
structions: "You will scrupulously avoid&#xD;
exhibiting yourselves at points where you&#xD;
can be seen from the house. Recollect&#xD;
that the conviction, if not the arrest, of&#xD;
the demon depends upon our action. If&#xD;
you are seen approaching the dwelling,&#xD;
you may not only expose Fleming and&#xD;
myself to great personal danger, but you&#xD;
will enable the culprit to secrete or destroy&#xD;
every vestige of his guilt. If you can&#xD;
reach the low ground just beyond the&#xD;
house undiscovered, remain there until&#xD;
we have been separated half an hour,&#xD;
unless you discover we have been assailed,&#xD;
when you will, of course, come to our&#xD;
relief. If all remains quiet at the time I&#xD;
have indicated, gather quietly, but in a&#xD;
body, around the house. And now let all&#xD;
act ,with circumspection. It is unneces-&#xD;
sary for me to add that we are engaged&#xD;
in an expedition of great difficulty, per-&#xD;
haps of positive danger."&#xD;
Eacji member of the company was well&#xD;
armed, and, confident of their strength,&#xD;
they prepared to follow the directions of&#xD;
their leader.&#xD;
Edward and Fleming, separating from&#xD;
their companions, and making a detour,&#xD;
approached the house from the opposite&#xD;
direction. Walking boldly up to the door,&#xD;
Fleming applied the back of his hand to&#xD;
it with.a sharp rap.&#xD;
~C Who is there ~" inquired a stern voice&#xD;
from within.&#xD;
"Hunters," responded the trapper,&#xD;
"who find success in stalking deer don't&#xD;
keep out the cold."&#xD;
"Come in, then," said the same harsh&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
The bolt was withdrawn, and the inns-&#xD;
sive oak door swung upon its hinges, and&#xD;
our adventurers found themselves beneath&#xD;
the low ceiling of a log cabin. The&#xD;
wooden slab which served 4or a window&#xD;
was still closed, and the apartment was&#xD;
but dimly illuminated by the fire that was&#xD;
fast kindling into a blaze upon the hearth.&#xD;
The blood curdled in Edward's veins, as&#xD;
he discovered by its flickering light that&#xD;
the room was tenanted by four stalwart&#xD;
and powerful men, and among the num-&#xD;
ber he saw the scowling and forbidding&#xD;
visage of the hunter whom he had ob-&#xD;
&#xD;
F'TON.&#xD;
&#xD;
served upon the roadside. Quickly press-&#xD;
ing Fleming's foot with his own, as a sig-&#xD;
nal that the person whom they sought&#xD;
was before them, he seated himself by&#xD;
the fire.&#xD;
"You are early upon the trail this&#xD;
morning, Mr. Fleming," observed one of&#xD;
the gang.&#xD;
The person addressed manifested no&#xD;
surprise at being recognized.&#xD;
"Oh, yes; you know that he who would&#xD;
compass the stag before he leaves his&#xD;
form for the bend in the river, must be&#xD;
early afoot."&#xD;
A pause ensued, when Edward under-&#xD;
went the close examination of the ruffians.&#xD;
"You must have been more fleet of&#xD;
foot than even you have reputation for, to&#xD;
come all the distance from Stamford this&#xD;
morning," said the other, suspiciously.&#xD;
"That is true; but you must know we&#xD;
c~me part way upon our horses."&#xD;
A few moments of silence again ensued&#xD;
during which time the outlaws were attir-&#xD;
ing their persons.&#xD;
"It is seldom," resumed the interro-&#xD;
gator, "that you cross the ridge in search&#xD;
of game. I do not think I have seen you&#xD;
in five years before."&#xD;
"Still we return to old haunts at last;&#xD;
I have been trapping for many a da~ upon&#xD;
the Hurricane."&#xD;
"Do you ever search for human&#xD;
game ~" inquired the brigand, signill-&#xD;
candy.&#xD;
Fleming found it necessary to temporise&#xD;
still longer, so as to give the rest of the&#xD;
party time to arrive at the house.&#xD;
"Nay, one who pays so little regard to&#xD;
the game laws as I do, may well leave&#xD;
man-catching to the officers of justice."&#xD;
"And who is your companion V' in-&#xD;
quired the sava~e-looking borderer, who&#xD;
had been scrutinizing Edward during the&#xD;
dialogue.&#xD;
"He is a country pupil of mine, that I&#xD;
am learning to stalk the deer and snare&#xD;
the muskrat."&#xD;
"For a countryman, he wears an ele-&#xD;
gant cravat, and his gold chain is rather&#xD;
costly, provided he came honestly by it."&#xD;
E war had unconsciously exposed&#xD;
these decorations to the gaze of the other.&#xD;
A momentary silence prevailed.&#xD;
"I can tell you,~~ continued the ogre&#xD;
fiercely, "who has thrust his neck into&#xD;
the merciless dutch. of the bear, in&#xD;
attempting to act the part of a spy. It is&#xD;
Edward Clifton, the lawyer !"&#xD;
As he uttered these startling words, the&#xD;
gang sprang to their feet with the utmost&#xD;
vehemence, and in an instant the cabin&#xD;
&#xD;
CLI]&#xD;
&#xD;
was the scene of the wildest commotion.&#xD;
Our adventurers now prepared to defend&#xD;
themselves with the utmost desperation.&#xD;
The brigands, with horrible imprecations,&#xD;
rushed upon them. They were met by&#xD;
men, however, who were not easily over-&#xD;
thrown. Fleming possessed an Hercula-&#xD;
nean frame, every muscle of which wus&#xD;
itidurated by exercise, while Edward was&#xD;
gifted with great personal strength and&#xD;
activity. Their antagonists, on the con-&#xD;
trary, although broad-shouldered and pow-&#xD;
erfully built, were slightly enervated by&#xD;
idle and dissipated lives. The odds,&#xD;
nevertheless, were great, and, if the&#xD;
attack upon our hero and his companmoii&#xD;
had been more cool and calculating, here&#xD;
would have ended this narrative. In their&#xD;
headlong passion, they did not seek the&#xD;
aid of firearms, but attempted to prostrate&#xD;
their foes by physical force. The fore-&#xD;
most was met by a blow from Edward's&#xD;
pistol, which fell upon his forehead with&#xD;
such violence that it laid bare the skull,&#xD;
and prostrated the ruffian insensible, upon&#xD;
the floor. While Flemrnr was contend-&#xD;
ing with the most power~'ul of the band,&#xD;
the remaining two seized Edward, and,&#xD;
after a long but fierce struggle, bore him&#xD;
back against the wall, and one of them,&#xD;
drawim~ a knife, exclaimed, "Thus let&#xD;
your secret die with you !" Aiming a&#xD;
blow at his heart, the glittering blade was&#xD;
descending, when the door was burst furi-&#xD;
ously open, and five armed men rushed&#xD;
into the room.&#xD;
"We are betrayed !" shouted the mur-&#xD;
derers; " but let us sell our lives dearly !"&#xD;
The ruffian whom Clifton had knocked&#xD;
down now sprang to his feet, and, retreat-&#xD;
ing together, they fought with the fury of&#xD;
despair. Fleming had effectually secured&#xD;
the one he was contending with, and,&#xD;
joining the rest of the party, he shouted,&#xD;
"The tables are now turned, my merry&#xD;
men-down with the vagabonds !"&#xD;
The assailed discharged several pis-&#xD;
tol-shots, and not without effect. A ball&#xD;
passed through the fleshy p art of Edward's&#xD;
arm, and another entered young David-&#xD;
son's leg. A blow from Fleming's&#xD;
clenched hand fell between the eyes of&#xD;
the murderer with such tremendous force.&#xD;
that it hurled him backwards, and his&#xD;
head coming violently in contact with the&#xD;
wall, he fell to the floor stiffened and&#xD;
motionless. The other desperadoes, borne&#xD;
down by superior numbers, were succes-&#xD;
sively overcome and secured, and the vic-&#xD;
tory was complete.&#xD;
"Here, Fleming, as you are half a sur-&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;
~'TON.                            97&#xD;
geon, examine ~ ~ said&#xD;
Edward.&#xD;
"I think you are in the most danger.&#xD;
Edward," observed the young man, "if I&#xD;
may judge from the paleness of your&#xD;
countenance. Yes, by heavens! staunch&#xD;
this wound, Fleming, or it will soon let&#xD;
out the life-blood."&#xD;
"Water !" said Edward, faintly.&#xD;
His coat was torn off; and the crimson&#xD;
tide gushed afresh from a severe wound&#xD;
in the ~rrn, above the elbow. Fleming&#xD;
applied ~ude ,bandages, and soon arrested&#xD;
the hemorrhage.&#xD;
"Lead me to the open air. I shall soon&#xD;
be better; the loss of blood was greater&#xD;
than I supposed."&#xD;
Fleming now examined Davidson's&#xD;
wound, but declared that extracting balls&#xD;
was beyond his skill. "You are in no&#xD;
danger, my young friend," lie observed,&#xD;
"but you will require the aid of Dr. Field-&#xD;
ing. Speaking of the devil, how surely&#xD;
he will appear. There he comes, as if es-&#xD;
pecially sent by Providence, and with his&#xD;
carriage, too !"&#xD;
" But too late, I fear,'~ replied the Doctor,&#xD;
jovially, "to do aught but minister to the&#xD;
wounded."&#xD;
"But how came you here, at alB" in-&#xD;
quired Clifton.&#xD;
"Why, you musty now, several of your&#xD;
party are blessed with very warm female&#xD;
friends; and aware of the impetuosity of&#xD;
youth, they sent for me early this morning,&#xD;
for the purpose of despatching me upon&#xD;
your footsteps. I had ascertained you ex-&#xD;
pected to meet the brigands somewhere in&#xD;
this neighbourhood, and summoning a&#xD;
body-guard of one magistrate, and half-a-&#xD;
dozen men, we took the lower miU~.road&#xD;
which, you know, is not half so long, and&#xD;
by dint of hard driving here we are, ready,&#xD;
my dear Davidson, to extract this ball,&#xD;
thus !" And the skilful surgeon, who, du-&#xD;
ring his speech had been actively em-&#xD;
ployed, deposited the ball upon the table.&#xD;
"And now," he coi~itinueafter having&#xD;
examined and dressed Edward's arm&#xD;
rather more scientifically," you and Wil-&#xD;
liam must take my carriage, as fever might&#xD;
ensue if you rode on horseback so far."&#xD;
The cabin was now searched. Upon&#xD;
the person of the one whom Edward sus-&#xD;
pected of having committed the murder,&#xD;
was found Freeman's watch, pocket-book,&#xD;
and the handkerchief from which the&#xD;
patch had been torn. To establish his&#xD;
guilt beyond a doubt, his shoe correspond-&#xD;
ed precisely with the measure which&#xD;
Fleming had taken of the track, where the&#xD;
hat of the murdered man had been found.&#xD;

&#xD;
At noon the party entered the village of&#xD;
Stamford, which was thronged by people&#xD;
from the country, who had been attracted&#xD;
thither to learn the particulars of the tra-&#xD;
gedy. The entrance of the felon and his&#xD;
comrades, and the wounds of Edward and&#xD;
Davidson. had the effect of increasing the&#xD;
excitement, and as Clifton alighted at the&#xD;
hotel upon the square, the crowd thick-&#xD;
ened, and he could with difficulty reach&#xD;
his apartment. As the manner in which&#xD;
theprisoners were captured became known,&#xD;
three loud and enthusiastic cheers ~vere&#xD;
given for "Edward Clifton arid his gallant&#xD;
companions !"&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
N&#xD;
"'Tie midnight hour; from flower to flower,&#xD;
The wayward zephyr floats along;&#xD;
Or lingers in the shady bower,&#xD;
To hear the night-bird's song."&#xD;
IT ~vas several weeks after the eventE&#xD;
transpired which were related in the lasi&#xD;
chapter, before Edward called upon an~&#xD;
of his female acquaintances. At length&#xD;
one evening, wearied by intense applica&#xD;
tion to his studies, and somewhat depiessct&#xD;
in spirits by the gloomy November weather&#xD;
he rang the door-bell at the residence o&#xD;
Judge Douglass. In answer to his in&#xD;
quiry if the ladies were at home, the ser&#xD;
vant responded that his young mistress~&#xD;
was ill, and Miss Drayton was making&#xD;
preparations to return to the capital th(&#xD;
following day.&#xD;
come in! I am so glad to se&#xD;
you !" joyfully exclaimed that lady, a&#xD;
Clifton was closing the door. "Hov&#xD;
could you absent yourself for sudh an age ~&#xD;
and she came forward with a glad smil&#xD;
as she extended her hand.&#xD;
"It is difficult for one who has been s&#xD;
often the recipient of your sarcasms, to be&#xD;
hieve that his absence is remarked !"&#xD;
"You cannot think so, Mr. Cliftor&#xD;
At all events, if you do, I regret exceed&#xD;
ingly that I have been so thoroughly mi~&#xD;
understood! Pray be seated. Take thin&#xD;
chair near the fire. Recollect, you ar&#xD;
still an invalid." He was forced to carr&#xD;
his arm in a sling.&#xD;
"And how have~~ou a mused course&#xD;
for so many weeks. he inquired.&#xD;
"Indifferently well. At least, my thank&#xD;
are scarcely due you for the aid whic&#xD;
has been afforded me !" and her fair li~&#xD;
slightly curled, as her foot agitated th&#xD;
&#xD;
spotless drapery, which was visible below&#xD;
the slightly elevated robe&#xD;
"It is doubtless a great misfortune that&#xD;
I have been prevented from enjoying more&#xD;
of your society; by ~vhich I am the suf-&#xD;
ferer, I beg you to remember, and not&#xD;
yourself!"&#xD;
"It is not too late !" replied the maiden,&#xD;
gaily; "and if you do not intend to claim&#xD;
exemption from the fate which you were&#xD;
kind enough to say I inflicted upon my&#xD;
admirers, why, you must come and see&#xD;
me when you visit the city."&#xD;
"I am truly obliged to you for the invi-&#xD;
tation, and as there is no one I would&#xD;
sooner be victimized by than your fair&#xD;
ladyship, I may yet yield you a moment's&#xD;
gratification, by suffering you to play upon&#xD;
my heartstrings, whatever amount of men-&#xD;
tal agony it causes me&#xD;
The tone of sadness with which he con-&#xD;
cluded (caused niore by a depression of&#xD;
spirits than by the theme), at once thrilled&#xD;
a tender chord in the breast of the lovely&#xD;
girl. Her countenance became agitated,&#xD;
and her bosom beat convulsively against&#xD;
the rich bodice which confined it. Bend-&#xD;
I ing forward, until those silken curls fell in&#xD;
a luxuriant mass upon his hand, she said,&#xD;
earnestly&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton, you must not think me a&#xD;
I cold, heartless woman. who seeks to win&#xD;
the regard of your se~ but to trifle with&#xD;
f their sensibilities. Because I have occa-&#xD;
- sionally passed a merry hour in listening&#xD;
- to the protestations of professional gallants,&#xD;
do riot, I implore you, deem me so heart-&#xD;
less as to cause a man of honour oi~e mo-&#xD;
mentary pang !"&#xD;
Warmed, in spite of himself, towards&#xD;
the beautiful enthusiast Edward, gazing&#xD;
s into those lustrous and passionate orbs,&#xD;
r whose power he found more and more ir-&#xD;
resistible, was upon the point of yielding&#xD;
o to the impetuosity of his feelings, when&#xD;
the door-bell rang, and Mrs. Broughton&#xD;
o was announced.&#xD;
"You perceive, I have been most un-&#xD;
fortunate in thus interrupting a charming&#xD;
i. t~te-~-t~te! Unless my presence has bin-&#xD;
I- ken the current of your thoughts, I will&#xD;
sometimes&#xD;
withdraw, like a spectre that&#xD;
Lt flits across the mirror of life."&#xD;
e "Pray do nothing of the kind," laugh-&#xD;
y ingly responded Virginia Drayton. "In&#xD;
the first place, it would require a more&#xD;
If vivid imagination than either Mr. Clifton&#xD;
or I possess, to transform your exquisite&#xD;
.s face and person into an apparition. Be-&#xD;
h sides, his dignity would revolt at the idea&#xD;
is of displaying so much weakness as a con-&#xD;
e fidential t~te-ft-t~te would imply."&#xD;
&#xD;
"What an inexplicable mortal !" men-&#xD;
tally exclaimed Edward.&#xD;
"Well, then, I will carry out my inten-&#xD;
tion of passing a few minutes with you,&#xD;
previous to your departure. Although I&#xD;
have limited the duration of my call, never-&#xD;
thelesh I have brought my work." And&#xD;
she drew forth some portion of a female&#xD;
habit.&#xD;
Mrs. Broughton was twenty-fiveyears of&#xD;
age, and had been two years married to&#xD;
a gentleman nearly twice as old. It was&#xD;
a marriage of convenience. He sought a&#xD;
person, youthful and gay, to preside over&#xD;
his household; while she desired a splen-&#xD;
did establishment. Both were gratified,&#xD;
and a union founded on esteem, had set-&#xD;
tled dowii upon the broad, though not&#xD;
always indestructible basis of affection.&#xD;
The lady possessed a greater share of&#xD;
personal attractions, than are usually be-&#xD;
stowed upon her sex. Her form ~vas of&#xD;
the medium height, but round and flexi-&#xD;
ble. Her complexion was exceedingly&#xD;
fair, her eyes gray, yet indescribably beau-&#xD;
tiful, and expressive, while the full bosom&#xD;
and alabaster shoulders, were surmounted&#xD;
by an exquisitely moulded neck. The&#xD;
small Norman feet were formed from&#xD;
Nature's choicest pattern; and when she&#xD;
walked, it was as though "money was&#xD;
bet on her."&#xD;
As the visitors rose to take leave, Miss&#xD;
Drayton invited them to visit her at her own&#xD;
residence. Edward could not fail to dis-&#xD;
cover, what was perfectly natural, no doubt,&#xD;
that she urged her request much more&#xD;
strongly when addressing Miss Broughton,&#xD;
than himself. He' sought to discover in her&#xD;
eyes some qualification of her easy self-&#xD;
possession, but they were cold and impas-&#xD;
sive. The dewy lips of the females met.&#xD;
~ custom more honoured in the&#xD;
breach than the observance, particularly&#xD;
before me," discontentedly remarked Ed-&#xD;
ward.&#xD;
'rhere is no pleasing these grumblers,~&#xD;
retorted Virginia, gaily; "so we must e'en&#xD;
do just as we please. One woald think that&#xD;
they ought to consider themselves suffi-&#xD;
ciently honoured by having permission to&#xD;
take our hands-at parting ?"&#xD;
The adieus were spoken, and Clifton&#xD;
had closed the door, when Mrs. Broughton&#xD;
requested him to return for her crochet-&#xD;
bag. Entering the parlour, he discovered&#xD;
Miss Drayton reclining upon the sofa, with&#xD;
disordered dress, and her face concealed&#xD;
in 1~ier hands. Hearing his footsteps, she&#xD;
started passionately to her feet, and (lash-&#xD;
ing away the tears that coursed (lown her&#xD;
&#xD;
cheeks, she indignantly asked 4he cause&#xD;
of his intrusion.&#xD;
trust Miss Drayton will deem me&#xD;
incapable of dishonourably attempting to&#xD;
obtain a knowledge of her secrets. I&#xD;
merely came as the messenger of Mrs.,&#xD;
Bj~.ughton to obtain this bauble, and.hav-&#xD;
ing (lone SO, I will no lono~er intrudeupon&#xD;
your privacy.~~&#xD;
Wounded at the implication upon hi~&#xD;
motives which her language implied, he&#xD;
turned haughtily away.&#xD;
"Stay, do not let us part in anger; wear&#xD;
this as a support to your wounded arm&#xD;
and she tore from her rone the ribbon&#xD;
that encircled it.&#xD;
With a flushed cheek he withdrew&#xD;
from her radiant presence, into the im-&#xD;
penetrable gloom of night.&#xD;
The dreary months of winter were num-&#xD;
bered with the past, and spring had&#xD;
again unlocked the frozen barrier which&#xD;
shielded the germ of vegetation from the&#xD;
frost. The season brought little change to&#xD;
our hero, save an accumulation of busi-&#xD;
ness, which had the effect of confining&#xD;
him more closely to his office. During&#xD;
the winter, his amusements consisted in&#xD;
a morning canter ~upon his gallant horse;&#xD;
and attendance upon the circuit court in&#xD;
four counties. As the warm air of spring&#xD;
unfolded the flo~vers, and caused the&#xD;
leaves and blossoms to shoot forth with a&#xD;
suddenness peculiar to a Southern climate,&#xD;
his feelings assumed their wanted health-&#xD;
fulness.&#xD;
The grounds of General Foster. were&#xD;
undergoing extensive and thorough repair,&#xD;
and as the back door of Edward's office&#xD;
opened into the garden, he was often re-&#xD;
quested by the proprietor, to make such&#xD;
suggestions as his taste night prompt.&#xD;
At these conferences. Ellen Foster was&#xD;
not present, although Edward frequently&#xD;
saw her expanding and beautiful form&#xD;
within the precincts of the garden. Once&#xD;
she approached them unconsciously, but&#xD;
when sternly admonished of her fault, she&#xD;
retreated like a startled fawn. Grieved at&#xD;
being the cause of this unfeeling rebuke,&#xD;
he resolved not to enter the enclosure&#xD;
again. Several weeks now passed ~vith-&#xD;
out his seeing the beautiful nymph. The&#xD;
harshness with which she was treated&#xD;
enlisted his sympathies, as he traced to&#xD;
that cause her pensive and thoughtful&#xD;
expression.&#xD;
As he was seated one night at an open&#xD;
window, long after the town was locked&#xD;
in ~deep, there came upon his ear sounds,&#xD;
indistinct and low, like the wailing of a&#xD;
person in deep 'distress. Keenly alive to&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC8086-00000045"/>&#xD;
100&#xD;
the unhappiness of others, he listened&#xD;
anxiously to ascertain from whence the&#xD;
sounds proceeded. Opening the door cau-&#xD;
tiously, he entered the grounds of General&#xD;
Foster, and advanced in the direction of&#xD;
the bower, which was situated near the&#xD;
centre of the enclosure. He ascertained&#xD;
that the moaning came from thence, but&#xD;
the thick foliage that clustered around&#xD;
prevented him from discovering who was&#xD;
the sufferer. Delicacy made him hesitate,&#xD;
for a moment, what course to pursue.&#xD;
What right had a stranger to intrude, when&#xD;
he had no. power to relieve the anguish 3&#xD;
He turned to depart, when a vehement&#xD;
burst of grief arrested his footsteps.&#xD;
"Why was I born, or ~vhen in exis-&#xD;
tence, oh! why did my own mother die,&#xD;
and leave me to the cruelty of a tyrannical&#xD;
step-mother 3 If she had lived, I should&#xD;
have been spared the agony of this horrible&#xD;
moment. To die by my own hand! It&#xD;
is frightful, yet not so terrible as a life,&#xD;
into which is crowded the most intense&#xD;
agony." A pause ensued, when the voice&#xD;
spoke with more determination. "Yes,&#xD;
better now than later; if I had one soli-&#xD;
tary friend to console me, it might be&#xD;
endured, but all are shut out, and I am&#xD;
now absolutely alone. This knife is now&#xD;
my only resource. t4od forgive me, and&#xD;
receive my soul."&#xD;
The bright blade was descending in the&#xD;
direction of her heart, when her hand&#xD;
was arrested by Edward, who exclaimed:&#xD;
"Rash girl, what would you do 3"&#xD;
Frightened by his sudden appearance,&#xD;
and overpowered by the intensity of her&#xD;
feelings, the unhappy girl fainted.&#xD;
"I am too late~ she will die! what can&#xD;
be done 3 No aid'at hand! Yes, it must be&#xD;
so ;" and raising her form in his arms, he&#xD;
bore her into his office, and laying her&#xD;
upon the sofa, sprinkled water in her face.&#xD;
"So young, so beautiful, and yet so&#xD;
unhappy! God of heaven! neither poverty&#xD;
nor wealth brings exemption from misery.&#xD;
It was long before the maiden recovered&#xD;
from her swoon; and when at last the&#xD;
drooping lids xve~e raised, and she gazed&#xD;
around the room~ it was with a bewilder~&#xD;
ed air, until her glance encountered the&#xD;
look of respectful sympathy which beamed&#xD;
from his eyes. Then her head reclined&#xD;
upon the cushion, and her overcharged&#xD;
heart found relief in a torrent of tears.&#xD;
Edward suffered her to weep undisturbed&#xD;
for several minutes, when he addressed&#xD;
her with a soothing voice.&#xD;
"Indeed, you were wrong, young lady,&#xD;
to raise your hand against the life which&#xD;
God gave you."&#xD;
&#xD;
~r '-I IN.                                                                   CLIFTON.                             101&#xD;
&#xD;
"Perhaps I was," she sighed; "and&#xD;
now the temptation is passed, I am grate-&#xD;
ful for your interposition. But oh, sir, you&#xD;
can scarcely imagine the mental agony I&#xD;
am each day subjected to; it is enough to&#xD;
drive me distracted," and she raised her&#xD;
hands and clasped them passionately to-&#xD;
gether, not suppose," said he ; "that an&#xD;
Do&#xD;
idle curiosity prompts me to solicit your&#xD;
confidence. But if you will unburthen&#xD;
your heart to me, I can sympathize with,&#xD;
if I am unable to alleviate your suffer-&#xD;
ings."&#xD;
The manner of Clifton had the effect of&#xD;
calming the agitated spirits of the young&#xD;
girl. Gazing with her large, piercing&#xD;
black eyes for a moment into his own,&#xD;
she confidingly placed her hand in his, as&#xD;
she said, "I have found a friend at last;&#xD;
I know I cannot be niistaken, for I feel&#xD;
relief here ;" and she placed her hand&#xD;
upon her heart. "But I must go now,&#xD;
my absence may be discovered, and you&#xD;
know," said she innocently, "that I ought&#xD;
not to remain here. If you will meet me&#xD;
at the bower to-morrow night, two hours&#xD;
earlier than it is now, I will make you my&#xD;
confidalit. You do not think it will be&#xD;
improper, do you 3" and she placed her&#xD;
taper flng~rs upon his arm, and sought his&#xD;
glance with her expressive eyes.&#xD;
Edward paused in deep thought. It&#xD;
would be a stain upon his honour, to ex-&#xD;
pose that fair flower, who leaned upon&#xD;
him so trustingly, to the hazard of being&#xD;
surprised in his company; and yet how&#xD;
could he prevent a recurrence of the ter-&#xD;
rible fatality which threatened her exis-&#xD;
tence, unless he was apprised of the&#xD;
secrets which preyed upon mind 3&#xD;
"Yes," said he, "I will meet you; but&#xD;
once only, and as a brother might advise&#xD;
a sister, against a threatening danger. But&#xD;
how can you obtain admittance to-night 3"&#xD;
"Oh, easily; my maid is aware of my&#xD;
absence, and is now awaiting my return.~~&#xD;
"She might have remained a long time&#xD;
at her post."&#xD;
Ellen shuddered. "Good night; many,&#xD;
many thanks for your kindness. Do not&#xD;
forget our interview !"&#xD;
"Doubt me not."&#xD;
And he saw her lithe and graceful&#xD;
form slowly receding, with her head bent&#xD;
sadly upon her bosom, until the shadowy&#xD;
outlines were lost in the gloom.&#xD;
&#xD;

"And bright&#xD;

"I AM glad, Mr. Clifton, you arrested&#xD;
the rash attempt upon my life," said Ellen,&#xD;
as they were seated in the arbour.&#xD;
~ strange, that any one should wish&#xD;
to terminate a career, for which the future&#xD;
has so many bright promises.~)&#xD;
"Where the present is embittered, hope&#xD;
affords no balm."&#xD;
"You are surrounded by wealth, and&#xD;

"Listen! My mother died when I was&#xD;
a child. She was the kindest and most&#xD;
affectionate being I ever beheld. Indeed&#xD;
Mr. CliftonI have never known what~'&#xD;
was to be loved by any other person.&#xD;
My father married, two years ago, a young,&#xD;
hard-hearted, and unfeeling woman, the&#xD;
object of whose' existence is to lacerate&#xD;
my feelings."&#xD;
"Why do you not inform your father&#xD;
of her conduct ~&#xD;
"I did, but only met with stern rebuke.&#xD;
My mother, who was as gentle as she was&#xD;
affectionate, once told me, when my father&#xD;
had left her in tears, that he had mar-&#xD;
ried her because she was an heiress, an(l&#xD;
after he had obtained her fortune, treated&#xD;
her with coldness and contempt. His&#xD;
aversion for his wife descended to her&#xD;
offspring, and he has always repulsed my&#xD;
affection.&#xD;
"All this I could bear, if it was not for&#xD;
the opprobrium which is daily heaped&#xD;
up on the name of my angelic mother.&#xD;
That arouses me to desperation."&#xD;
"Your fate is a hard one."&#xD;
"Yes, but now I can bear it more cheer-&#xD;
fully, since I have you to console me."&#xD;
And the maiden's eyelids drooped, until&#xD;
they half concealed her lustrous orbs.&#xD;
"How can 1 see you 3 I have never&#xD;
been introduced to your step-mother, and&#xD;
you are too young to receive visitors 3"&#xD;
"Oh! they will not permit you to see&#xD;
me. Our interviews must be here !"&#xD;
"If we are not discovered. Still, when&#xD;
spring and summer are gone, the cold&#xD;
winds of autumn will keep you from the&#xD;
arbour 3"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Never! though the storm may rage,&#xD;
my heart will be warm&#xD;
There was no resisting the guileless&#xD;
maiden, and Edward consented to meet&#xD;
her, occasionally, in the bower.&#xD;
"Do you know, Clifton !" said Dr.&#xD;
Fielding, "our party talk of nominating&#xD;
you to represent the county in the Legisla-&#xD;
ture 3"&#xD;
~ "Impossible !"&#xD;
"True, I assure you. I am a member&#xD;
of the county caucus, and you are a dele-&#xD;
gate to the congressional and senatorial&#xD;
convention, which assembles the same day&#xD;
at Bergen. On your return, you will un-&#xD;
doubtedly be apprised of your nomina-&#xD;
tion !"&#xD;
"I am exceedingly obliged to my&#xD;
friends, and, Fielding, to yourself in par-&#xD;
ticular, for this flattering assurance, but&#xD;
really, nothing could be more injurious&#xD;
than a compliance with your wishes."&#xD;
"Why so3"&#xD;
"It would interfere with my profession,&#xD;
be unjust to my clients, and entangle me&#xD;
irretrievably in politics !"&#xD;
"As an offset, it will bring you in con-&#xD;
tact with the most prominent men in the&#xD;
state, and will enable you to pass a very&#xD;
pleasant winter in the metropolis."&#xD;
"But the contact will be upon a warm&#xD;
platform, and the relaxation will distract&#xD;
my attention from legal investigation.&#xD;
Eecollect the fate of the Carthaginians at&#xD;
Capua."&#xD;
"Nothing is more common, than for&#xD;
lawyers to perform their duties in the legis-&#xD;
lative hall, and attend the sessions of the&#xD;
Supreme Court."&#xD;
"They are generally men who have&#xD;
passed the heyday of youth, and are not&#xD;
tempte(l by the fascinations of the capi-&#xD;
tal."&#xD;
"Very well, you can decline the nomi-&#xD;
nation, if you please, but I am inclined to&#xD;
think it will be made."&#xD;
Clifton attended the convention at Ber-&#xD;
gen. A long-established favourite was&#xD;
nominated for re-election to Congress.&#xD;
For the office of senator, Edward was&#xD;
anxious 'to procure the position for his&#xD;
friend Harden, who was, however, un-&#xD;
known to the delegates from the other&#xD;
counties. The recommendation ~vas so&#xD;
earnest, that he was selected. On his re-&#xD;
turn, and before he had entered the village&#xD;
of Stamford, Edward was apprised of his&#xD;
own nomination for the county. The&#xD;
court met the following Monday. A large&#xD;
crowd assembled, and clifton mounting&#xD;
the rostrum, with many thanks for the&#xD;
honour conferred upon him, declined the&#xD;

&#xD;
nomination. Several months after, he at-&#xD;
ten~led the Supreme Court. While passing&#xD;
from the hotel to the hall of justice, he&#xD;
met Virginia Drayton.&#xD;
A warm blush stole across the face of&#xD;
the lady, as she returne(1 liis salutation.&#xD;
What is the name of that really fine-&#xD;
looking gentleman, Virginia 3"&#xD;
Mr. Edward Clifton; a person I picked'&#xD;
up, a few months ~&#xD;
"Another victim 3"&#xD;
Not exactly, but he is in a transition&#xD;
state."&#xD;
The language which vanity prompted&#xD;
her to utter, was unfortunately overheard&#xD;
by the only person who had ever touched&#xD;
her heart.&#xD;
Edward had followed her footsteps, for&#xD;
the purpose of ascertaining the number of&#xD;
her residence, and was in the act of pro-&#xD;
nouncing her name, when her ungracious&#xD;
words fell upon his ear. He retraced his&#xD;
steps on the instant.&#xD;
It was a jam. The saloons were crowded&#xD;
with gay women a d chivalrous men. The&#xD;
parlour, hall, and chambers, were thronged.&#xD;
Everywhere was that soft pressure, so en-&#xD;
chanting to our sex, so graciously pardoned&#xD;
by theirs. It was the Governor's reception.&#xD;
These politicians have not grown gray in&#xD;
protracted conflicts, without acquiring a&#xD;
thorough knowledge of men. The Gover-&#xD;
nor's salutations were as dissimilar as the&#xD;
characters who presented themselves. It&#xD;
was amusing to witness the versatility of his&#xD;
talents. For, a successful contact with a&#xD;
promiscuous multitude, is evidence of a&#xD;
high order of intellect. To one, his man-&#xD;
ner was frank, a sort of "give me a chew&#xD;
of tobacco," familiarity; to another, his&#xD;
greeting was deferential; a third, was wel-&#xD;
comed with dignified courtesy. The de-&#xD;
mocrats were received with congratula-&#xD;
tions, and the whigs with a modest allu-&#xD;
sion, "to the fortune of war."&#xD;
"Governor, it will be our time next; so&#xD;
prepare yourself!"&#xD;
"I am always ready, Col. Blanchard, to&#xD;
obey the voice of the people.-The Colonel&#xD;
takes the defeat of his party sorely,&#xD;
Judge 3" said his excellence, as the whig&#xD;
leader mingled with the crowe.&#xD;
"Yes, and it was an unexpected tri-&#xD;
umph, and mainly attributable to your&#xD;
own exertions."&#xD;
"Thank you, Judge. How are you, Mack 3&#xD;
Why, I have not seen you since that glori-&#xD;
ous barbecue at the cross-roads; you have&#xD;
been well, I hope 3 and the wife and little&#xD;
ones 3"&#xD;
"All well, Governor;and I reckon no&#xD;
ond is more pleased at our triumph over&#xD;
&#xD;
the Feds, than Mack Durkee. I callers told&#xD;
you wouldd be so3"&#xD;
"True, Mack, 1 recollect; now, go on,&#xD;
yonder, you will find the table loaded with&#xD;
fare, equaPto your barbecue."&#xD;
Another party entered, in the midst of&#xD;
which was a tall and commanding form.&#xD;
"General, I am most happy to see you.&#xD;
This is far more agreeable than our pro-&#xD;
tracted contest upon the stump."&#xD;
"It is doubtless, to you, Colonel, who&#xD;
proved the victor."&#xD;
"Another time, you may be the host,&#xD;
and I the guest; these political revolutions&#xD;
sometimes go backwards, you know."&#xD;
"Yes, I have just witnessed an illustra-&#xD;
tion of your remark, Goverr~or."&#xD;
"Always severe. Let ray wife con(lole&#xD;
with you; I believe she would have given&#xD;
her influence for you, if I had not been a&#xD;
candidate."&#xD;
The crowd became more dense iii the&#xD;
vicinity of these reno~vned competitors;&#xD;
but separated again, as the Governor's wife&#xD;
took the arm of his opponent.&#xD;
"Your message was a capital docu-&#xD;
ment," said Senator -. "It is rarely&#xD;
that I have heard an executive commu-&#xD;
nication so much lauded."&#xD;
"Are there no complaints that it is too&#xD;
radical in its conclusions 3"&#xD;
"Sorrie of the old conservatives object&#xD;
to it upon that account, but the pro-&#xD;
gressive portion of the Legislature are in&#xD;
ecstasies."&#xD;
"I am sure it will take with the people,&#xD;
especially the young men," continued the&#xD;
Governor;" enough attention has not been&#xD;
paid to that part of our population. They&#xD;
will exercise within a fourth of a century,&#xD;
a greater influence in this republic, than&#xD;
the combined power of wisdom and age.&#xD;
You must address yourself to them, if you&#xD;
would succeed in doubtful struggles. The&#xD;
great political lever is enthusiasm; once&#xD;
enlist it in your cause, and your triumph&#xD;
is certain. Youth alone is enthusiastic.&#xD;
For the future, I play to win the young&#xD;
men."&#xD;
At this moment Edward presented him-&#xD;
self, He was well known to the Governor.&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton, this is an unexpected ho-&#xD;
nour. When did you arrive in town 3"&#xD;
"Yesterday; and hearing you had a&#xD;
public reception to-night, I tookthe liberty&#xD;
of paying my respects."&#xD;
"You are thrice welcome. I heard of&#xD;
your refusal to accept a seat in the Legisla-&#xD;
ture. Perhaps you were right, yet your&#xD;
ultimate career must be the political arena.&#xD;
You have too many elements of success&#xD;
&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
CLIFTON.                     108&#xD;
&#xD;
to devote a lifetime to the drudgery of&#xD;
the law."&#xD;
Edward bowed. The compliment was&#xD;
gratifying, but he was annoyed that His&#xD;
Excellence had observed the skill with&#xD;
which the shaft had been launched. He&#xD;
was advancing into the room, when the&#xD;
Governor arrested his ~steps, and calling to&#xD;
his side a graceful maiden, he said-&#xD;
"Blanche, this is ray friend. He is a&#xD;
stranger in the city, and unknown to our&#xD;
guests. Mr. Clifton, my niece. Don't turn&#xD;
her head, she is yet a sehool.girl.~~&#xD;
She raised a pair of laughing eyes to&#xD;
Edward's face, for the purpose of con-&#xD;
vincing him that there was no danger,&#xD;
and taking hjs arm, they were borne by&#xD;
the gay throng into the interior of the&#xD;
Executive mansion.&#xD;
"Am I to keep you out of danger by&#xD;
appropriating you to myself, or shall I&#xD;
lead you into harm's way by introducing&#xD;
yu to some fair lady 3" said the merry&#xD;
girl.&#xD;
"I think I am in as much peril now as&#xD;
I can resist."&#xD;
"Oh !" putting her hand upon her&#xD;
mouth, "what did uncle tell you ~&#xD;
"He ought to have told me that I was&#xD;
in more danger than his niece."&#xD;
"You are incorrigible ~ replied the&#xD;
laughing girl.&#xD;
At all events, I am satisfied with my&#xD;
fate, and in that respect resemble certain&#xD;
persons we read of, ~vho hug the chains&#xD;
which enslave them.'&#xD;
"The literal translation whereof reads&#xD;
thus: Mr. Clifton ~vill accept the protec-&#xD;
tion of Miss Blanche for at least fifteen&#xD;
minutes, or until some more attractive&#xD;
damsel crosses his path. You see I under-&#xD;
stand human nature, if I am a school-girl."&#xD;
They entered the room occupied by the&#xD;
dancers. Conspicuous among them, Ed-&#xD;
ward discovered Miss Drayton; she was&#xD;
waltzing with a young and dashing mem-&#xD;
ber of the Governor's staff. Their looks&#xD;
met. The recognition of .the lady was&#xD;
cordial, Edward's frigid. He was soon&#xD;
whirling the flexible form of his partner&#xD;
around the room. In the throng there&#xD;
were, unavoidably, many collisions, but&#xD;
they had thrice traversed the rlpartment&#xD;
with out accident, wh~ the pressure in&#xD;
one corner became so dlose that the bro-&#xD;
cade skirts of a dark-eyed lady partly en-&#xD;
circled the form of our hero. With a&#xD;
graceful self-possession she released him,&#xD;
and he found himself in the presence of&#xD;
Ellen Foster's step-mother. He bowed&#xD;
low, in acknowledgrndjit of her-.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon'~ sir."&#xD;
&#xD;
Before they could resume the waltz, and&#xD;
while Clifton's arm encircled the waist of&#xD;
his partner, she observed-&#xD;
"What! you two reside in the same vil-&#xD;
lage, and not acquainted 3 That will never&#xD;
do. Mri. Foster, allow me to present my&#xD;
prot~g~, Mr. Clifton."&#xD;
"You know, Blanche, I have not min-&#xD;
gled in society, lately, owing to the death&#xD;
of a near relative."&#xD;
"Ah, that accounts for it."&#xD;
"When did you leave Stamford, Mr.&#xD;
Clifton 3"&#xD;
"Day before yesterday."&#xD;
"Do you know if our family were all&#xD;
well 3"&#xD;
"I saw General Foster within the~ hour&#xD;
of my departure, and he assured me they&#xD;
were all in perfect health."&#xD;
Mrs. Foster was splendidly dressed. Her&#xD;
robe was made of the costliest brocade&#xD;
silk. Upon her head she wore a tiara of&#xD;
diamonds, which scarcely surpassed in&#xD;
beauty the luxuriant folds of her jet-black&#xD;
hair.&#xD;
"While our partners are conversing, let&#xD;
us take a ~ said the gentleman to&#xD;
Blanche.&#xD;
"Why I shall leave him in the very&#xD;
jaws of temptation."&#xD;
"Never fear; he is safe with me."&#xD;
Edward thought it was strange that such&#xD;
a lovely woman could be so cruel. Her&#xD;
complexion was exceedingly fair, her&#xD;
eyes, as black as night, had no "lurking&#xD;
devil in them." Her shoulders were as&#xD;
white as Parian marble, and the round&#xD;
full form, had all the flexibility of youth~&#xD;
He looked for the cloven foot, but his&#xD;
glance fell upon small pedestals trimly en-&#xD;
cased in satin slippers.&#xD;
"'Tis very strange !" he mentally ex-&#xD;
claimed. "I will know more of her.~'&#xD;
"Our partners have deserted us. Will&#xD;
you be the substitute of iVliss Blanche for&#xD;
this polka 3"&#xD;
"With pleasure."&#xD;
As they wound through the fairy maze,&#xD;
her eloquent eyes were raised for fleeting&#xD;
moments to his o~vn, and her fragrant&#xD;
breath played upon his cheek. Away&#xD;
they sped, as sparkling eyes, glittering&#xD;
diamonds, fluttering dresses, flying feet,&#xD;
and pliant limbs floated past. At first his&#xD;
partner moved with ease, scarce resting&#xD;
her taper fingers upon his arm, while his&#xD;
hand barely touched her waist. But as&#xD;
they proceeded she claimed more support.&#xD;
His arm, tightening upon her zoned rew&#xD;
the yielding form nearer to his person, th~&#xD;
tiny hand was elevated to his shoulder,&#xD;
and her respiration became more rapid~ as&#xD;

Clifton turned his eyes to the centre of "If I have done aught to give you of-&#xD;

"Not so well as you do !"&#xD;
"Do you think not? It makes my feet&#xD;
sore here,~~ and she touched the instep.&#xD;
Edward had never seen anything so beau-&#xD;
tifully shaped, except Alice Howard's.&#xD;
As he rose to take his leave, she ob-&#xD;
served, "Do not forget that we start early&#xD;
the day after to-morroW."&#xD;
"I shall be prepared."&#xD;
As he wended his way to the hotel, he&#xD;
resolved to fathom her character, andif&#xD;
possible, to acquire an influence over her&#xD;
which should ameliorate the condition of&#xD;
her unhappy step-daughter.&#xD;
The following night he was invited to&#xD;
attend a meeting of the Democratic mem-&#xD;
bers of the Legislature, at the mansion of&#xD;
the Governor. The assemblage was in-&#xD;
formally organized by the appointment of&#xD;
an aged S enato rasChairman. The ques-&#xD;
tion under consideration was the prospects&#xD;
of the party at the next Presidential elec-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"I attribute the cause of our defeat in&#xD;
1840," said the Speaker of the House, "to&#xD;
- the cold and phlegmatic temperament of&#xD;
Mr. Van Buren. It is useless to disguise&#xD;
the fact, that the influence of General Jack-&#xD;
son elected him in 1836. He has always&#xD;
been a dead weight upon our party.&#xD;
There are no elements about the man to&#xD;
create enthusiasm, and he is most popu-&#xD;
lar with persons who have never seen&#xD;
him. A selfish man will always become&#xD;
odious, because his enemies will assail,&#xD;
and he has no admirers to defend him.&#xD;
Our candidate in 1840 had no supporters&#xD;
who would sacrifice for his advancement&#xD;
what General Jackson's would for him.&#xD;
He never made a favourable impression&#xD;
upon them. They* left his presence as-&#xD;
sured of the overwhelming selfishness of&#xD;
the man. A Northern editor, who had sa-&#xD;
crificed large sums for him in the canvass&#xD;
of 1836, called upon the President. He&#xD;
was shown into the parlour, and congratu-&#xD;
lated himself upon having a private inter-&#xD;
view with the Executive. Mr. Van Buren&#xD;
entered, and throwing himself into an easy&#xD;
chair, seemed more interested in contem-&#xD;
plating a well-fitting boot than in making&#xD;
a favourable impression upon his sup-&#xD;
porter. No one likes to be treated with&#xD;
indifference, and the editor left the White&#xD;
House, thoroughly despising its' occupant.&#xD;
In selecting a candidate for the next con-&#xD;
flict, let us choose one who is personally&#xD;
popular. It is the personal bearing of Mr.&#xD;
Clay which renders him the terror of the&#xD;
democracy. Thousands of devoted hearts&#xD;
&#xD;
~TON.                            105&#xD;
rally around the gallant leader, and nothing&#xD;
but his principles excludes him from the&#xD;
Presidential chair."&#xD;
"There is undoubtedly much force in&#xD;
the remarks of my friend," observed a&#xD;
gray-headed Senator, "but there wen&#xD;
other elements which contributed to our&#xD;
defeat. The feelings of our people were&#xD;
aroused in behalf of the Canadian patriots,&#xD;
and thousands were indignant at the pro-&#xD;
clamation of Mr. Van Buren. In the&#xD;
northern tier of States, it lost him the sup-&#xD;
port of entire masses. It is absolute folly&#xD;
to suppose that resistance can be offered,&#xD;
with impunity, to the participation of the&#xD;
Americans in thu struggles of contiguous&#xD;
States f~r freedom and independence.&#xD;
While the Northern States were expressing&#xD;
their interest in the Canadian struggle, ten&#xD;
thousand rifles were grasped for the pur-&#xD;
pose of driving the Mexican invader from&#xD;
the soil of Texas. These facts must not&#xD;
be overlooked. The sympathies of our&#xD;
population will always be excited in the&#xD;
cause of a people struggling to free them-&#xD;
selves from oppression. This ingredient&#xD;
will enter into every Presidential contest&#xD;
until the continent is brought under the&#xD;
protection of the stars and stripes. Shrewd&#xD;
politicians float on the current; theydo&#xD;
not attempt toNresist it."&#xD;
After he had resumed his seat, there was&#xD;
a pause, when Edward rose to address&#xD;
the chairman. "While I admit," he ob-&#xD;
served, "that the personal bearing of Mr.&#xD;
Van Buren, as well a~ his proclamation,&#xD;
contributed largely to his disgraceful de-&#xD;
feat, still, there were other causes which&#xD;
operated more powerfully. The rag-cur-&#xD;
rency with which the country was flooded&#xD;
by worthless institutions, had brought ruin&#xD;
to the hearthstones of thousands. A gene-&#xD;
ral bankruptcy pervaded the whole land,&#xD;
and a shout was raised for a change of ad-&#xD;
ministration. In vain our stump-speakers&#xD;
explained the causes of the wide-spread&#xD;
disaster; they were answered, 'Our con-&#xD;
dition cannot be worse!' It was the al-&#xD;
mighty dollar which decided the Presi-&#xD;
dential contest of 1840. There were ac-&#xD;
cessories other than those referred to by&#xD;
the two gentlemen. A leading principle&#xD;
of the Democratic party, since it was or-&#xD;
ganized by Mr. Jefferson, has been the ac-&#xD;
quisition of territory. Upon that question&#xD;
thetwo great factions have been divided.&#xD;
The cold reception which the cabinet of&#xD;
Mr. Van Buren gave to the application of&#xD;
Texas for admission into the Union, gave&#xD;
umbrage to the progressive democracy.&#xD;
He did not keep pace with public opinion,&#xD;
and no laggard can arrest the attention of&#xD;
&#xD;

our enthusiastic population. They will&#xD;
have more land. It is useless to resist the&#xD;
impulse; it will prostrate everything that&#xD;
opposes it. Every contiguous acre of land&#xD;
will be annexed until the continent is ours.&#xD;
The democratic columns are filled with&#xD;
ardent progressionists, who will be driven&#xD;
into the Whig ranks if this portion of&#xD;
the Democratic creed is abandoned. The&#xD;
very boldness of the policy, and its mani-&#xD;
fest tendency to enlarge the area of free-&#xD;
dom, wins to its support thousands of rest-&#xD;
less spirits, who despise the timid and con-&#xD;
servative principles of the Whig party.&#xD;
"The programme of the last campaign&#xD;
displayed the most stupid ignorance of&#xD;
human nature. It must be discarded&#xD;
hereafter. We entered the political arena,&#xD;
openly proclaiming that no appeal was to&#xD;
be made to the enthusiasm of the voters.&#xD;
We were determined to rely upon the jus-&#xD;
tice of our cause. Nothing could have&#xD;
been more fatal than this annunciation.&#xD;
There are always enough men to turn the&#xD;
scale in a Presidential election, who re-&#xD;
gard it a~ a kind of jubilee. Theylike&#xD;
to rally beneath partisan banners. Excite-&#xD;
ment has more effect upon them than an&#xD;
appeal t~ their judgments. There was&#xD;
another radical defect in our tactics. We&#xD;
have hit l~erto nominated very respectable,&#xD;
but super~nnuated old men upon the elec-&#xD;
toral ticket, under the erroneous impres-&#xD;
sion that their names would make con-&#xD;
verts of our opponents. This is a fatal&#xD;
mistake. We want active, vigorous men,&#xD;
who will mount the stump, and for half a&#xD;
year's campaign proclaim the dogmas of&#xD;
the Democratic party. We want no more&#xD;
hackneyed politicians who have outlived&#xD;
enthusiasm. Let us have ardent, impetu-&#xD;
ous, hopeful young men, who can inspire&#xD;
hope in others; men with warm imagina-&#xD;
tions and generous impulses; then, victory&#xD;
will certainly crown our efforts!"&#xD;
As Edward concluded, there was a&#xD;
warm demonstration of applause. The&#xD;
Governor, who had entered the room as&#xD;
h~ commenced, now advanced, and said,&#xD;
as he cordially shook his hand,&#xD;
"You have taken a correct view of the&#xD;
case, and I tha~k you for so ably express-&#xD;
ing         which I have lonr enter-&#xD;
opinions                b&#xD;

tinued, in a low tone, "will place you&#xD;
upon the electoral ticket."&#xD;

LANDON.&#xD;
IT was a bright morning in October-&#xD;
that most delightful of all the months of&#xD;
the year-when General Foster's carriage&#xD;
left the metropolis. His fair wife and&#xD;
Edward Clifton were its sole occupants.&#xD;
A heavy frost was fast disappearing before&#xD;
the sun's rays, but its blight was indicated&#xD;
by the falling leaves, which descended in&#xD;
continuous masses to the earth. The sap&#xD;
-that life-blood of the trees-was con-&#xD;
gealed, and the forest appeared in undress.&#xD;
The uninterrupted descent of the variega-&#xD;
ted foliage alone disturbed the profound&#xD;
stilliiess which reigned in the xiToo(l.&#xD;
The spirited horses had traversed a&#xD;
score of miles, and were now ascending&#xD;
a range of hills which led to the high-&#xD;
lands between the metropolis and Stam-&#xD;
ford.&#xD;
"What could be more charming than a&#xD;
scene like this ~" said the lady, as she.&#xD;
threw herself back in the carriage, after a&#xD;
long survey of the valley through which&#xD;
they had just passed.&#xD;
"Nothing, I am sure," responded Ed-&#xD;
ward, "especially with a companion who&#xD;
can appreciate its beauties."&#xD;
"That is true," she sighed: "Unfortu-&#xD;
nately, the General has no eyefor Nature's&#xD;
loveliness."&#xD;
"Pardon me, madam, I think you do&#xD;
him injustice; in the choice of a compa-&#xD;
nion he has exhibited a decided apprecia-&#xD;
tion of the beauties of Nature."&#xD;
"You are very complimentary, Mr.&#xD;
Clifton," replied the lady in a reserved&#xD;
tone; but Edward saw, nevertheless, a&#xD;
pleased expression steal, like a flitting&#xD;
shadow, across her countenance.&#xD;
"No, if you please; I am simply just."&#xD;
"Do you see that lofty peak, where the&#xD;
opening trees give us a view of the moun-&#xD;

"What, the cone separated from us&#xD;

"Do not distress yourself so much," he&#xD;
said, in a soothing voice, as he took her&#xD;

SJIAK5PEARR.&#xD;
GENERAL HARRISON did not long survive&#xD;
&#xD;
his elevation to the Presidency. His suc-&#xD;
cessor failed to win the confidence of the&#xD;
Whig party, and the fierce denunciations&#xD;
pf its great leader, were leyelled at his&#xD;
head. Posterity will form an impartial&#xD;
judgment, as to the merits of the quarrel4&#xD;
between John Tyler, and the voters who&#xD;
elected him. He was accused of having&#xD;
o~~ned negotiations for the annexation of&#xD;
Texas, for the purpose of prolonging his&#xD;
political power. Steps had been taken by&#xD;
the democrats, whigs, and Tyler men, to&#xD;
hold conventions for the purpose of open-&#xD;
ing the campaign of 1844.&#xD;
"How are you; Clifton ~ I am glad to see&#xD;
you," said Clarendon, as he entered Ed-&#xD;
ward's office, accompanied by Dr. Field-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"The happiness is mutual. Sit down.&#xD;
It is long since I had the pleasure of see-&#xD;
ing you. Fielding, how isyour healthV'&#xD;
"'Tis surprising, Clifton, how these&#xD;
physicians always keep in good health,&#xD;
and yet they never take any of their own&#xD;
pills. How do you account for it ~"&#xD;
"Exercise in the open air, and a con-&#xD;
sciousness of doing good, are undoubtedly&#xD;
the principal ~&#xD;
"You are far too charitable. They&#xD;
strikingly illustrate the follies of human&#xD;
nature. The fear of death makes us&#xD;
seek the aid of a physician, with some-&#xD;
thing of that desperate confidence which&#xD;
the Catholic exhibits ~vhen claiming the&#xD;
intercession of the priest, and with just as&#xD;
slight a prospect of SuCCC5S."&#xD;
"So far as honesty is exhibited by the&#xD;
two pr4ofessions,~~ retorted Fielding, "I&#xD;
think honours are easy. There is one thing&#xD;
I can say of ours, however. No fee is&#xD;
sufficiently large, to induce us to sell our&#xD;
opinions to tile first ragamuffin who&#xD;
chances to bid for them."&#xD;
"If you do not sell your opinions,&#xD;
you adhere to them, right or wrong, with&#xD;
dogmatical obstinacy, even if it causes&#xD;
the death of your patients."&#xD;
"Come, gentlemen, you are getting&#xD;
heated. That is wrong, among friends;&#xD;
let us change the subject," said Clifton.&#xD;
The eyes of his companions flashed fire,&#xD;
but with an effort, they controlled their&#xD;
feelings.&#xD;

"Harry of the West, and by acclama-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"But if he opposes the annexation of&#xD;
Texas 'P'&#xD;
"He will not be so blind as to do that."&#xD;
"I am nOt so certain. The National&#xD;
&#xD;
Intelligencer and Louisville Journal are&#xD;
openly denouncing the movement. Would&#xD;
they do this without the sanction of Mr.&#xD;
Clay ~ Come in, Judge Douglass. Mr.&#xD;
Senator Harden, you are welcome."&#xD;
"You are correct, Mr. Clifton. Henry&#xD;
Clay must oppose the annexation 6f Tex-&#xD;
as,' observed Judge Douglass.&#xD;
"He will be driven to it by two consi-&#xD;
derations. That portion of the Whig party,&#xD;
at the North tainted with abolitionism,&#xD;
will require it. If the question becomes&#xD;
popular, John Tyler will claim the fruits,&#xD;
so that opposition is Mr. Clay's only re-&#xD;
"Who will be your candidate, Clifton ~'&#xD;
"The chances are in favour of Mr. Van&#xD;
Btiren."&#xD;
"The opinion he last expressed upon&#xD;
the subject, was adverse to annexation."&#xD;
"That was several years ago.~~&#xD;
"You will find," said the Judge, "he&#xD;
does not keep pace with the desire for&#xD;
more land, which influences the Demo-&#xD;
cratic party ~"&#xD;
" He will be cast overboard then, 7~ said&#xD;
Harden, promptly.&#xD;
"It is barely possible," interposed Ed-&#xD;
ward, "thath e will array himself against&#xD;
the measure. The Washington Globe,&#xD;
edited by his friend Blair, is advocating&#xD;
the movement with great power.7~&#xD;
"And then he has the example of Ge-&#xD;
neral Jackson, to urge him onwards,~) said&#xD;
the Senator.&#xD;
"But the opposing influences are&#xD;
equally powerful," replied the Judge. "A&#xD;
large majority of Northern politicians have&#xD;
taken a stand against the acquisition; he&#xD;
is in their midst, and more likely to be&#xD;
controlled by sectional prejudices, which&#xD;
are constantly whispered in his ear, than&#xD;
by the distant muttering of public senti-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
"Whatever course the politicians ma y&#xD;
have taken, in a moment of resentment,~7&#xD;
observed our hero, "the acquisition of&#xD;
contiguous territory, has become a part of&#xD;
the Democratic faith. The rank and file&#xD;
of the party, North and South, are commit-&#xD;
ted to it, unalterably. The annexation of&#xD;
Texas will become popular throughout&#xD;
the Union."&#xD;
"If that is the case, what will you do&#xD;
with its projector, President Tyler ~"&#xD;
"We shall have nothing to do with&#xD;
him," said Fielding; "we never deal in&#xD;
cast ~&#xD;
"Byt he way, Judge,~) remarked Har-&#xD;
den, "it is curious how fiercely your party&#xD;
assail the man whom you so recently&#xD;
elevated to the presidency of the senate ~"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Not at all. He richly deserved it&#xD;
from the voters whom he had betrayed ~'&#xD;
"I must be excused for dissenting from&#xD;
your conclusions. John Tyler has always&#xD;
been opposed to the measures which Mr.&#xD;
Clay urged upon him with so much per.&#xD;
"But did he not shed tears because&#xD;
Mr. Clay was not nominated, instead of&#xD;
General Harrison V' responded the Judge,&#xD;
warmly.&#xD;
"I discover, you are as sensitive as the&#xD;
rest of the whigs, upon the subject. But&#xD;
let us treat it with coolness and good-na.&#xD;
ture. The sole pretext for the remorseless&#xD;
attack upon the President of the United&#xD;
States, is the shedding of tears at Harris-&#xD;
burg. That Mr. Tyler admired Mr. Clay,&#xD;
as much as he despised Martin Van Bu-&#xD;
ren, is undeniable. But if the President is&#xD;
to be denounced for urging the nomina-&#xD;
tion of the Kentuckian at Harrisburg, with&#xD;
a perfect knowledge of his principles, is&#xD;
not the great statesman just as culpable&#xD;
for advocating the election of Captain Ty-&#xD;
ler, with his opinions recorded in the jour-&#xD;
nals of the Senate ~&#xD;
"Well put, by Jove 1" exclaimed Field-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"But he was bound in honour to carry&#xD;
out the principles of the party that elect-&#xD;
ed him."&#xD;
"I deny the proposition in toto. He&#xD;
was not called upon, by honour or duty, to&#xD;
abandon those principles which he h ad,&#xD;
over and over again, declared to be essen-&#xD;
tial to the prosperity of the American con-&#xD;
federacy. He would have been a. traitor,&#xD;
doubly damned, if he had bartered his opi-&#xD;
nions to subserve the purposes of Henry&#xD;
Clay. No, sir!" exclaimed Harden, be-&#xD;
coming excited himself. "1 can tell you&#xD;
the cause of the onslaught, which for ran-&#xD;
cour has no parallel in the history of&#xD;
political warfare. John Tyler was not&#xD;
satisfied ~vith being an accidental Presi-&#xD;
dent. He was playing for the succession.&#xD;
This interfered with the programme of the&#xD;
Western orator. John Tyler must be&#xD;
headed, at all hazards, and hence bank&#xD;
charters, fiscal agencies, and a whole brood&#xD;
of wild and destructive measures, were&#xD;
hurried through Congress, and presented&#xD;
to the executive, with a perfect assurance&#xD;
that he would exercise the veto power.&#xD;
When lie had verified their mental pre-&#xD;
dictions, the cry of traitor was raised in&#xD;
the Senate, it was echoed in the House of&#xD;
Representatives, and found a response&#xD;
wherever a Clay man could be found.&#xD;
Harry of the West ~has attained his object.&#xD;
Captain Tyler is prostrate and powerless."&#xD;

"If we have treated him so ungracious-&#xD;

"I can tell you, Mr. Clarendon. The&#xD;
democracy are not in the habit of select-&#xD;
ing their candidates from the ranks of&#xD;
their opponents !"&#xD;
"But, according to your own statement,&#xD;
John Tyler is more of a democrat than a&#xD;

"He has nevertheless been damned&#xD;
with knowledge of you. Besides, his ap-&#xD;
proval of the bankrupt law, is an insur-&#xD;

don.&#xD;

"Your uncourteous reference to the&#xD;

petuot~ Clarendon.&#xD;
He th ad met a person, unfortunately, as&#xD;

Fielding grew pale, and his lips quivered&#xD;
as he exclaimed.&#xD;
"The annunciation of a truth may&#xD;
sometimes p rove unpalatable, but cannot&#xD;
be regarded as discourteous ~&#xD;
"There was no foundation for your&#xD;

Clarendon passionately. "It was both&#xD;
false and gratuitous.~~&#xD;
"That is sufficient, sir !" said Fielding,&#xD;
as with a powerful effort he controlled his&#xD;
indignation. "Gentlemen, good night !"&#xD;
and he left the office.&#xD;
"Come, Clarendon," said Judge Dou-&#xD;
glass, "you were too quick. You ought&#xD;
to apologize."&#xD;
"Never! I have heard these rude allu-&#xD;

leader often enough. I will suffer it no&#xD;
more !"&#xD;
"You will have to fight half the county&#xD;

"Very good; I may as well commence&#xD;

&#xD;
In fifteen minutes, young Davidson en-&#xD;
tered. He was the bearer of a challenge.&#xD;
A duel was arranged. The young men&#xD;
were to meet in the Glen at six o'clock the&#xD;
next morning. Although Edward as the&#xD;
friend of both parties, declined acting as&#xD;
the second of either, still he determined&#xD;
to be present, for the purpose of effecting&#xD;
a reconciliation, if possible. Late at night&#xD;
he entered Fielding's office. The lamp&#xD;
was burning, but the young physic ian was&#xD;
not in the room. Opening the door which&#xD;
led into the sleeping apartment, he beheld&#xD;
the Doctor seated by the fire, absorbed in&#xD;
deep thought.&#xD;
"Fieldince cannot this affair be amica-&#xD;
bly adjusted'?"&#xD;
"It is impossible. The insult was too&#xD;
gross.~~&#xD;
"But if he apologizes'?"&#xD;
"I do not think he will; and if he does,&#xD;
in my present state of mind I would reject&#xD;
all explanations."&#xD;
"Why'?"&#xD;
"Because he is altogether too impe-&#xD;
rious, and wants chastising."&#xD;
"If you lose your life in the attempt'?"&#xD;
"It will be my destiny !" and lie&#xD;
shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
"Davidson is your second; who is Cla-&#xD;

"Captain Morgan."&#xD;
"Harden, Douglass, and myself, will be&#xD;

"Take care that no 6ne else is apprised&#xD;

"What are your weapons'?~~&#xD;

"Will be determined upon the ground.~.~&#xD;
"Good night. I regret the quarrel."&#xD;
"It will be all the same, one hundred&#xD;

"Perfectly reckless !" muttered Edward,&#xD;
as he closed the office door.&#xD;
The May morning dawned fair and&#xD;
cloudless. A warm rain, during the night,&#xD;
refreshed the flowers, and the forest im-&#xD;
pregnated the atmosphere with sweet&#xD;
odours. As Clifton and his companions&#xD;
attained the highland which overlooked&#xD;
the Glen, a thin vapour curled upwards&#xD;
from the bosom of the lake, and like the&#xD;
removal of breath from a mirror, it dis-&#xD;
closed the smooth and transparent surfa~e.&#xD;
"Fielding is already upon the ground,'~&#xD;
observed Harden.&#xD;
"I do not see him," said the Judge.&#xD;
"Look yonder, where the scanty under-&#xD;

"True !"&#xD;
The sound of horses' feet rapidly ad-&#xD;

his second dashed up. They were all&#xD;
soon assembled upon the beach.&#xD;
~CWe must lose no time !" said Cia-&#xD;

ments."&#xD;
"It is not our fault that the affair is not&#xD;
over now,~~ said his antagonist, in a low&#xD;
tone, as he glanced at his watch.&#xD;
"Another taunt, Dr. Fielding !" replied&#xD;
Clarendon, fiercely. "Captain Morgan&#xD;
could tell you that we were detained"-&#xD;
"Not another word !" interrupted the&#xD;
Captain. "He who impugns our honour&#xD;
makes an enemy of me."&#xD;
Although he despaired of success, Ed-&#xD;
ward attempted to effect a reconciliation.&#xD;
The refusal was positive. Captain Mor-&#xD;
gan touched his hat to young Davidson,&#xD;
and they walked aside.&#xD;
"I have my own pistols, Mr. Davidson;&#xD;
I thought they were better than any you&#xD;
could procure on so short a notice."&#xD;
"Thank you, Captain."&#xD;
"They are loaded alike; you can take&#xD;
your choice."&#xD;
'' Your word is sufficient; either will&#xD;
do."&#xD;
"At what distance shall they fire'?"&#xD;
"I am instructed to insist upon five&#xD;
paces.~~&#xD;
"Why that will never do. It is mur-&#xD;
derous !" ejaculated Clarendon's second.&#xD;
"My orders are positive !" said the&#xD;
other, firmly.&#xD;
"Ten is the usual number. I will con-&#xD;
sult my principal."&#xD;
"Yes, yes !" said Clarendon, impa-&#xD;
tiently. "We will insert the muzzles of&#xD;
our weapons in each other's mouths, if he&#xD;
is willing. An'?Jthing to avoid the inter-&#xD;
ference of the officers."&#xD;
The ground was measured. Five short&#xD;
paces between time and eternity. The&#xD;
combatants faced each other. Fielding&#xD;
was calm and collected. His countenance&#xD;
was resolute, and his commanding figure&#xD;
was drawn up to its full height. Claren-&#xD;
don's face was flushed with auger, and&#xD;
his graceful form trembled with passion.&#xD;
As the words "Make ready I" were pro-&#xD;
nounced by Captain Morgan, every symp-&#xD;
tom of agitation disappeared, and his figure&#xD;
became as motionless as the surround-&#xD;
ing oaks. His arm was elevated until it&#xD;
covered the form of his antagonist. The&#xD;
word was given, and a simultaneous re-&#xD;
port followed. Fielding p laced his left&#xD;
hand upon his side, and reeling back-&#xD;
&#xD;
111&#xD;
&#xD;
wards, fell, desperately wounded, upon&#xD;
the greens ward. His gallant foe remained&#xD;
standing for an instant, and theui sunk&#xD;
to the earth. Harden raised his head.&#xD;
The current of his blood had ceased flow-&#xD;
ing; the pulsations of his brave heart were&#xD;
silent. The spirit had departed, and the&#xD;
soulless clay was all that remained of the&#xD;
gifted and heroic Clarendon.&#xD;

borne the absence of our hero'? Her jour-&#xD;

"September, 1840.-I have not heard&#xD;
from him yet. Why does he remain si-&#xD;
lent'? Surely he must know that his ab-&#xD;
sence is a source of unhappiness to me.&#xD;
And yet why should he'? It would have&#xD;
been unmaidenly to make an exhibition&#xD;
of my attachment. He never told me of&#xD;
his love. I am but a school-girl. Still his&#xD;
manner was so tender. Could papa have&#xD;
exacted a promise from him'? The thought&#xD;
is horrible! Oh! he could not be so cruel.&#xD;
I will ask him. But that will never do.&#xD;
It will force me to disclose my unsolicited&#xD;
affection. Time* time&#xD;
the mystery    ,    alone, will unravel&#xD;
"January, 1841.-To-morrow will wit-&#xD;
ness another examination. Shall I stand&#xD;
at the head of my class again'? I hope so,&#xD;
for his sake. It is that alone which arouses&#xD;
my ambition. I will not surrender the&#xD;
ho ~e that he will return to claim me.&#xD;
Fate would not be so unkind as to sepa-&#xD;
rate us for ever. During his absence I will&#xD;
cultivate my mental powers, and fit my-&#xD;
self to become his companion. Heavens!&#xD;
with what joy the idea thrills my heart!&#xD;
"I am happy. My parents are affec-&#xD;
tionate; the school-girls love me; the&#xD;
teachers all take pride in my mental im-&#xD;
provement,, and the mirror flatters my&#xD;
vanity. Is it not wrong to be gratified by&#xD;
flattery'? But truth is not flattery, and the&#xD;
mirror is truthful; that, at least, is honest.&#xD;
If I should be deceived, though, by its as-&#xD;
surances. To know ourselves is next to&#xD;
impossible. How many girls, ay, and&#xD;
women too, fancy themselves beautiful'?&#xD;

I think them shockingly plain. If I should&#xD;
deceive myself as well as they! Let me&#xD;
see. I have beautiful eyes. My teeth&#xD;
are white as ivory, and what is of equal&#xD;
importance, well set. My complexion is&#xD;
rich and changeable. My nose straight&#xD;
and well formed. My eyebrows beauti-&#xD;

"One cannot trust to public criticism,&#xD;
because popularity depends so much upon&#xD;
manner. I have seen very plain, lut&#xD;
clever young ladies, surrounded by beaux.&#xD;
Dress, too; is an important auxiliary. But&#xD;
there is one infallible indication of beauty,&#xD;
so I heard Miss Glendower say. If the at-&#xD;
tention of strangers is arrested as you&#xD;
pass, it is safe to count upon the posses-&#xD;
sion of great personal loveliness. They&#xD;
gaze as if they were looking upon a glori-&#xD;

"But what d6 I care for female ~uharms.&#xD;
It is only for the sake of Edward Clifton,&#xD;
whom I may never behold again."&#xD;
"June, 1842.-Againat the head of my&#xD;
class. I ought to be satisfied. I have no&#xD;
thought but for Edward and my school-&#xD;
books. Many an hour, as I am seated by&#xD;
my lamp, does memory revert to those&#xD;
moments of happiness when he was by my&#xD;
side. Too fleeting hours! why were you&#xD;
numbered so rapidly with the irreclaima-&#xD;
ble past ~ Gone, gone! but memory lives."&#xD;
"March, 1843.-In four months I shall&#xD;
graduate. What joy that word gives to&#xD;
many a school-girl who has been for one-&#xD;
third of her life immured in brick walls.&#xD;
For years she has obtained faint glimpses&#xD;
of the gay world through her prison bars.&#xD;
For fleeting moments suffered to escape,&#xD;
only to return to more than slavish bon-&#xD;
dage, she has sighed for the hour which is&#xD;
to witness her emancipation. So others&#xD;
feel. They complain of being forced to&#xD;
sleep forty in one room. One asks for a&#xD;
free circulation of air. Another has a&#xD;
violent cold. They are watched, and the&#xD;
malicious report them. Two young ladies&#xD;
were sent to bed, yesterday, for twelve&#xD;
hours. Last night, when the informer&#xD;
blew out her candle and jumped into bed,&#xD;
shivering with cold, she found the sheets&#xD;
saturated with iced-water. With a scream&#xD;
she bounded upon the floor. An ague&#xD;
was the consequence. To-day, the young&#xD;
ladies, who admitted the perpetration of'&#xD;
&#xD;
the deed, were sent to bed for twelve&#xD;
hours longer."&#xD;
"July, 1843.-It is over. I have tri-&#xD;

clinging to my neck, she deplored the&#xD;
fate which kept her imprisoned for twelve&#xD;
months. The time will soon pass, and&#xD;
the day she leaves the brick building for&#xD;
ever, will be the happiest of her existence.&#xD;
The emotions which in after-life cause&#xD;
the heartstrings to quiver, are never so&#xD;
gushing, so overwhelming, as when the&#xD;
school-girl claims her freedom. The hap-&#xD;
piness which has been gaining interest&#xD;
from disuse, during five years of oppres-&#xD;
sion, she now deems exhaustless. Will&#xD;
the future disappoint her hopes '~ I have&#xD;

"Agreed. If the ladies are not afraid&#xD;
to remain here by themselves, we will all&#xD;
go and olve them a distant vie~v of the&#xD;
cavern by the light of our candles."&#xD;
"Oh, do. Nothing will harm us. I&#xD;
should so much like to witness the spec-&#xD;
tacle," exclaimed Mrs. Foster.&#xD;
"Light the candles, then, Sambo, and&#xD;
arrange them in a cluster upon the frame."&#xD;
"Now, then, you son of darkness, move&#xD;
on; if you are killed, I will see that you&#xD;
are properly dissected."&#xD;

~&#xD;
The ladies watched the receding party&#xD;
as their forms diminished in the distance.&#xD;
and the lights grew more and more indis-&#xD;
tinct. Their progress was slow, as they&#xD;
picked their way along the water-course,&#xD;
now stepping upon the stones which&#xD;
emerged from the stream, and anon cling-&#xD;
ing to the sides of the precipice a hun-&#xD;
dred feet in the air. Once they clustered&#xD;
together, and waved their lights, the faint&#xD;
rays from which scarcely penetrated the&#xD;
gluom to the spot where the ladies congre-&#xD;
gated. Suddenly they were extinguished,&#xD;
and that part of the cave was involved in&#xD;
darkness.&#xD;
"What 'could have caused, the acci-&#xD;
dent~" exclaimed Em~, hurriedly.&#xD;
"A blast of air," responded Helen.&#xD;
"Come, we must go to their relief, at&#xD;
every hazard. They can never return in&#xD;
the dark ~ continued the agitated girl.&#xD;
But perhaps they have matches.'&#xD;
A faint flash for a moment lit up the&#xD;
gloom, and was succeeded by a rumbling&#xD;
sound, which increased as it approached,&#xD;
until it rung through the cavern, and each&#xD;
solitary nook and gloomy dell had again&#xD;
and again echoed the reverberation.&#xD;
"It is a signal of distress," said Emy.&#xD;
"No time is to be lost; let us proceed.~'&#xD;
"But can we thread that dangerous&#xD;
path l" anxiously inquired Mrs. Foster.&#xD;
"We can try. At least we can go part&#xD;
way. The light from our lamps may&#xD;
assist them to return."&#xD;
Another flash was followed by the&#xD;
report of a pistol.&#xD;
"Come, come ~ impetuously ex-&#xD;
claimed Helen. "I will not leave them&#xD;
to grope their way in darkness, over those&#xD;
&#xD;
frightful chasms. If you will not accom-&#xD;
pany us, Emy and I ~vill proceed alone."&#xD;
The generous girl seized a lamp, which&#xD;
cast its light upon her pale but resolute&#xD;
countenance, and, advancing a short dis-&#xD;
tance, the maiden looked back .upon her&#xD;
companions, while the outlines of her&#xD;
beautiful form were drawn against the&#xD;
gloom.&#xD;
"Stop a moment, and let me get up all&#xD;
my clothes, Helen,~' said ~Iiss Davidson,&#xD;
as she prepared to cross the stream.&#xD;
"I will go with you, girls." They de-&#xD;
scended together.&#xD;
"What is that '~" said Mrs. Foster.&#xD;
"Is it licvhtV'&#xD;
"Notfrom their candles," responded&#xD;
Helen. "I saw it before the report of the&#xD;
first pistol. It is probably the light of day&#xD;
penetrating through a crevice in the rocks."&#xD;
While they were proceeding along the&#xD;
dismal way, Harden was endeavouring to&#xD;
ignite a lucifer match.&#xD;
"It was wrong to extinguish all the&#xD;
candles, Fielding," he remarked; as match&#xD;
after match flickered a moment, and then&#xD;
went out. "The atmosphere is damp,&#xD;
and we will be in a sad predicament if I&#xD;
cannot relight them. There is a current&#xD;
of air here, too Let us advance a little.&#xD;
Softly, here is a descent. We are at the&#xD;
bottom. Now let me try." The wood&#xD;
caught, nn(l the candles were soon lighted.&#xD;
They now proceeded, and in a few&#xD;
minutes reached the bank of the creek.&#xD;
"What has become of the ladies' in-&#xD;
quired Clifton. "They are no longer&#xD;
visible."&#xD;
"Sure enough," replied Harden, "they&#xD;
have vanished like fairies."&#xD;
"Could they suppose that our lights&#xD;
were accideiitally extinguished, and have&#xD;
they started to relieve us&#xD;
"Lay not the flattering unction to your&#xD;
heart, Fielding. There is a bend in the&#xD;
creek; see you not the reflection of their&#xD;
,lights upon the vault ~"&#xD;
"Yes, Harden is right." observed Clif-&#xD;
ton. "Let us proceed."&#xD;
The stream now plunged into an un-&#xD;
fathomable abyss. Standing upon the&#xD;
summit, the noise of the falls, which for&#xD;
some time had faintly reached their ears,&#xD;
now made the rocks tremble beneath their&#xD;
feet.&#xD;
They mutely gazed upon the roaring&#xD;
flood as it disappeared.&#xD;
'' Here ends our ramble,'' said Harden,&#xD;
"unless, Sam Patch-like, we leap into the&#xD;
gulf"&#xD;
"Let me cast a stone over the falls to&#xD;

"Here, Sambo bring hither that rock."&#xD;
No sound came back but the roar of the&#xD;
water.&#xD;
They must be of great depth. As&#xD;
there is an insurmountable barrier to our&#xD;
further progress, let us return, and conduct&#xD;
the ladies here."&#xD;
Approaching the spot where they had left&#xD;
their companions, no lamps could be seen.&#xD;
"By Jove! Fielding, they are repaying&#xD;
you for your attempt to frighten them.&#xD;
They are not here, though; the spot is&#xD;
vacant. HaIloa!" No answering re-&#xD;
sponse was heard save the echoes of the&#xD;
cavern.&#xD;
This is strange, ~ said Clifton, aux-&#xD;
ously. "Have they become impatient at&#xD;
our long ~&#xD;
"Surely, they would not attempt to re-&#xD;
turn without ~ replied Harden. "It is&#xD;
only a joke; they are secreted in some of&#xD;
these nooks; let us find them."&#xD;
But the search was ineffectual, and the&#xD;
young men assembled again at the spot&#xD;
~vhere they had last seen the ladies.&#xD;
"One of two things is certain," said&#xD;
Edward, decidedly. "They have either&#xD;
returned to the mouth of the cave, or,&#xD;
alarmed for our safety when the lights&#xD;
were extinguished, they lost their way in&#xD;
attempting to approach us."&#xD;
"Clifton has given us the correct solu-&#xD;
tion of the matter," said Fielding, "and&#xD;
I propose that two of us retrace our foot-&#xD;
steps in search of the path which led them&#xD;
astray, while the other two return to the&#xD;
mouth of the cave."&#xD;
When Edward and Sambo emerged&#xD;
from the cavern, there was no sign of the&#xD;
fugitives, and the horses were standing as&#xD;
the slave had left them.&#xD;
Hastening back, Edward met his baffled&#xD;
companions, whose search had been equal-&#xD;
ly unavailing. They were all now tao-&#xD;
roughly alarmed for the safety of the&#xD;
females.&#xD;
~CAre there no pathways diverging from&#xD;
the main avenue leading to the falls '?" in-&#xD;
(Iuire(l Clifton.&#xD;
"None; we have examined both sides&#xD;
of the creekfrom its margin to the dome,&#xD;
and there is but one channel."&#xD;
"Let us examine the earth; perhaps&#xD;
we can discover their footsteps.&#xD;
They all knelt to 'the task but the&#xD;
ground ~vas so beaten that an impression&#xD;
could not be made upon its surface.&#xD;
Re'cediAg fr~m the centre, they sought&#xD;
long but ineffectually for some sign&#xD;
~f their companions. They had all&#xD;
yielded in despair except Fielding, who&#xD;
&#xD;
was examining the border of the stream.&#xD;
"By Heaven! here it is !" he cried joy-&#xD;
ously, "and here, and here. They have&#xD;
crossed the creek."&#xD;
He was not mistaken. The impression&#xD;
of several small feet had been made in&#xD;
the soft earth. j3ut the trail was again&#xD;
'lost upon the opposite shore, and every&#xD;
attempt to find it proved fruitless.&#xD;
Well, gentlemen, what's to be done '?'&#xD;
asked Harden.&#xD;
A painful silence ensued.&#xD;
"The ground becomes marshy, a fe~&#xD;
rods ahead. Suppose we examine it," said&#xD;
Fielding.&#xD;
No print of a female foot was visible.&#xD;
"If you are certain," said Edward, "that&#xD;
no channel diverges from this, it is useless&#xD;
to seek for them in the direction of the&#xD;
falls. We must explore every avenu be-&#xD;
tween this and the mouth of the Cay nd&#xD;
speedily too, for the day is waning&#xD;
At the end of two hours they had ex-&#xD;
amined every nook and corner throughout&#xD;
the cavern, and disheartened and dis-&#xD;
mayed, they stood at the outlet.&#xD;
"There is some fearful mystery about&#xD;
this affair," said Fielding, solemnly. ''I&#xD;
leave not the spot until it is unravelled&#xD;
" We will remain,'~ replied Clifton.&#xD;
"harden, you and Sambo return to Staiu-&#xD;
ford with the horses; it will not do to let&#xD;
the brutes starve. Do not mention the af-&#xD;
fair to any one, except Judge Douglass&#xD;
and Davidson. A large crowd will only&#xD;
render their recovery the more difflcnlt,&#xD;
by removing all traces of the wanderers.&#xD;
Return hither as soon as possible with&#xD;
ropes, food, and lights."&#xD;
The souiid of the horses' feet became&#xD;
more and more indistinct, until at last it&#xD;
died away in the distance. The sun had'&#xD;
disappeared, and night had drawn her&#xD;
sable curtain across the shifting scenes, as&#xD;
the young men again penetrated the tomb&#xD;
which enclosed the living, if not the dead.&#xD;
They shouted "Helen !" "Emy !" but&#xD;
the reverberating echoes alone replied,&#xD;
" Helen !" " Emy !" at first distinctly, and&#xD;
then more and more faintly, until their&#xD;
names were pronounced as if by the spirit&#xD;
~of the place, in accents low and whis-&#xD;
pering.&#xD;
"This suspense is intolerable !" said&#xD;
Fielding. ~' What friglttful calamity can&#xD;
have befallen the ladies ~"&#xD;
"Perhaps, in following the bank of the&#xD;
creek, they have been precipitated into&#xD;
deep water, or have become confuse&#xD;
the intricate windings"       ed by&#xD;
Once more they proceeded towards the&#xD;
falls, and for half a mile examined every&#xD;
&#xD;
foot of the way. There was a basin a short&#xD;
distance from the square room. It did not&#xD;
exceed a dozen feet in diameter, but was&#xD;
far deeper. The water was transparent,&#xD;
and they could discover no object upon the&#xD;
bottom. The rocky pass rendered it im-&#xD;
possible to follow a trail, and they reached&#xD;
the falls without having obtained the&#xD;
slightest clue of the lost females. The&#xD;
dispirited Fielding was preparing to return.&#xD;
"Stop!" said Clifton, who had been&#xD;
gazing into the abyss. "Is not that a&#xD;
light far down the chasm ~"&#xD;
"Impossible! No human being could&#xD;
reach the foot of the falls alive. It is&#xD;
doubtless the reflection of our candles&#xD;
upon the spray."&#xD;
"No! by heaven, it is a light !" shouted&#xD;
Edward. "There ! there! dim and scarcely&#xD;
perceptible; do you not see it ~"&#xD;
It vanished, and for several moments&#xD;
not a word escaped the lips of the young&#xD;
men as they gazed with awe for the reap-&#xD;
pearance of the light. They saw it no&#xD;
more, and turned their looks upon each&#xD;
other for an explanation.&#xD;
"There is a tradition," said Fielding,&#xD;
in a serious voice, "that a gang of high-&#xD;
waymen once inhabited this Cave; but&#xD;
that was mnamiy years ago."&#xD;
"Great God! Doctor, why did you not&#xD;
inform me of that report '~ We ought not to&#xD;
have left the ladies unprotected."&#xD;
"It had escaped my memory. I re-&#xD;
garded it as the idle fancy of the supersti-&#xD;
tious."&#xD;
"It may, alas! prove too true, and if&#xD;
these helpless women have fallen into their&#xD;
hands"-&#xD;
"Stop! for Heaven's sake! there's mad-&#xD;
ness in the thought."&#xD;
They gazed long and anxiously down&#xD;
the gulf, but no ray of light penetrated the&#xD;
mist. It was now midnight, and the two&#xD;
young men seated themselves upon the&#xD;
verge of the precipice. They had not kept&#xD;
their vigils long, when lights approached&#xD;
from the mouth of the Cave.&#xD;
"What is that !" exclaimed Fielding,&#xD;
with a nervous start.&#xD;
"Harden is returning," said Clifton.&#xD;
The forms of Judge Douglass, Harden,&#xD;
Davidson, and Sambo, were seen thread-&#xD;
ing the devious sway.&#xD;
"What news of the lost ones ~" inquired&#xD;
the Judge, anxiously.&#xD;
"We have seen a light at the foot of the&#xD;
falls."&#xD;
"Where is the channel which leads&#xD;
thither ~&#xD;
"We have searched for it in vain."&#xD;
"Sambo, the rope !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Stop, Judge, that shall be my duty&#xD;
said Fielding.&#xD;
"Take food, then, before you make the&#xD;
attempt."&#xD;
"Impossible! I have no appetite."&#xD;
"Here is brandy; your strength ~vili&#xD;
fail you."&#xD;
"What would you do !" exclaimed&#xD;
Harden. "It is more than two hundred&#xD;
feet to the foot of the falls. Inevitable de-&#xD;
struction awaits any one who makes the&#xD;
attempt."&#xD;
"I will try. When I pull this cord,&#xD;
raise me; until I do, let me descend by the&#xD;
rope.~~&#xD;
A pulley was adjusted to prevent the&#xD;
hemp from being cut by the rock, and the&#xD;
adventurous young man was soon lost in&#xD;
the spray. He continued to descend, and&#xD;
coil after coil of the rope disappeared.&#xD;
until they supposed he had nearly reached&#xD;
the foot of the falls, when the eightt was&#xD;
suddenly unloosened, as if the rope had&#xD;
been severed. In dismay they rapidly&#xD;
drew it up, and to their amazement, disco-&#xD;
vered that the cable had been cut with a&#xD;
knife.&#xD;
"Who could have done this ~" said the&#xD;
Judge.&#xD;
"Certainly not Fielding," responded&#xD;
Edward. "He would not deprive himself&#xD;
of the only means of escape. 1 will now&#xD;
make the attempt !"&#xD;
"No, no! Mr. Clifton, him my massa&#xD;
said Sambo, resolutely. "I must go for&#xD;
him mysef."&#xD;
"You are an affectionate fellow, but I&#xD;
can manage this affair better than you.~~&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton, I mus go for Massa&#xD;
Fielder," persisted the slave, while the&#xD;
tears started to his eyes. "Him callers kind&#xD;
massa to Sambo."&#xD;
"Let him go if he insists," interposed&#xD;
the Judge. "All we want to know is the&#xD;
fate of the lost ones."&#xD;
The black disappeared in the mist, and&#xD;
when he had descended as far as his&#xD;
master, the rope was again severed. Lis-&#xD;
tening intensely, they caught the sound of&#xD;
a suppressed yell, as, mingling with the&#xD;
roar of the cataract, it came faintly to&#xD;
their ears.&#xD;
"There is an unfathomable mystery&#xD;
about this cavern," said the Judge, solemn-&#xD;
ly. "It is folly to hazard more lives in at-&#xD;
tempting to descend the falls. What is&#xD;
our next resource&#xD;
"If, as I suppose," said Clifton, "there&#xD;
are rooms unknown to us in this cave, may&#xD;
they not be inhabited by reckless and&#xD;
desperate men, who have seized our com-&#xD;
panions ~"&#xD;

&#xD;
"The thought is horribid," said the&#xD;
Judge, as his cheek blanched.&#xD;
"It is, and I regret that I am forced to&#xD;
suggest it. But if I am right, we must&#xD;
adopt a different plan of operations to ef;&#xD;
fect their rescue."&#xD;
"What do you propose ~"&#xD;
"We must wait for them to disclose the&#xD;
passage, which we cannot find ourselves.&#xD;
Our lights must be extinguished, and they&#xD;
must believe the Cave is deserted. I sug-&#xD;
gest that one of us remain in ambush at&#xD;
the mouth of the Cavern, an other here, the&#xD;
third in the square room, and the fourth in&#xD;
the middle of the Cavern."&#xD;
The Judge grasped his hand warmly.&#xD;
The food was divided, and they agreed to&#xD;
keep watch in silence for twenty-four&#xD;
hours. Harden returned to the outlet,&#xD;
while the others remained, Clifton at the&#xD;
falls, Douglass in the square room, and&#xD;
Davidson towards the mouth of the Cave.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
"When, as she saw him madly spring,&#xD;
And midway up in danger cling,&#xD;
She flung him down her long black hair,&#xD;
Exclaiming, breathless, 'There, Jove, there!'"&#xD;
MOORE.&#xD;
"Then tell me, why, thou child of air!&#xD;
Does slumber from her eyelids rove?&#xD;
What is her heart's impassioned care ?-&#xD;
Perhaps, oh sylph! 'tis love."&#xD;
MOORE.&#xD;
bun after hour elapsed, until the&#xD;
sun had once more mounted into the&#xD;
heavens. Edward was seated upon a pro-&#xD;
jection of the rock, resting his cheek&#xD;
upon his hand. Exhausted by fatigue, the&#xD;
struggle between watchfulness and sleep&#xD;
was, nevertheless, long and painful. The&#xD;
murmuring of the waterfall soothed his&#xD;
senses and the impenetrable darkness&#xD;
which walled him in, afforded no object&#xD;
upon which his eyes could rest. The lids&#xD;
closed at last, and his form relaxed, as a&#xD;
deep sleep settled upon his frame.&#xD;
The Judge was more wakeful. The fate&#xD;
of his only child weighed heavily upon his&#xD;
mind, and his vigilance was sleepless.&#xD;
Seven hours had elapsed; still, nothing&#xD;
disturbed the tomb-like silence which&#xD;
reigned in those subterranean halls. The&#xD;
-ihoments dragged, as though ages had&#xD;
been claimed by time since he com-&#xD;
menced his vigils. To his tortured heart,&#xD;
it might have been days, weeks, months,&#xD;
or years, since he extinguished his light.&#xD;
&#xD;
His limbs were stiff; he touched his head&#xD;
to see if it had become bald. He gnashed&#xD;
his teeth, and laughed low and merrily,&#xD;
when he ascertained they were still in his&#xD;
jaws. He laid his finger upon his pulse,&#xD;
to see if it heat with the feebleness of age.&#xD;
It dashed on with the velocity of a raging&#xD;
fever. The suspense at length amounted&#xD;
to intense agony, and he was in the act of&#xD;
shouting Clifton's name, when there fell&#xD;
upon his ear a noise as of rushing water.&#xD;
It continued for several minutes, and then&#xD;
died away with a murraurillg sound, like&#xD;
the escape of water through a whirlpool.&#xD;
A faint light was now perceptible, issuing&#xD;
from the earth, scarcely a dozen rods be-&#xD;
yond the river, and in the direction of&#xD;
the falls. Crouching behind one of the&#xD;
benches, the Judge saw four men emerge&#xD;
from the basin, which we have already&#xD;
described, and proceed in the direction of&#xD;
the spot occupied by Clifton. When their&#xD;
forms had disappeared behind a curve in&#xD;
he rock, he lighted the candle in his dark&#xD;
't~ntern, and advanced cautiously towards&#xD;
the basin. The water had disappeared&#xD;
through a hole in the bottom. In the side&#xD;
of the rock, several feet below the water-&#xD;
line, a stone door had been fitted in the&#xD;
natural ~vall so artistically, that it baffled&#xD;
the most careful examination. It was now&#xD;
open, and within, Judge Douglass sa~v a&#xD;
flight of wooden steps, leading upwards.&#xD;
He now secreted himself behind a small&#xD;
mound of earth, near the secret door and&#xD;
extinguishing his light, anxiously awaited&#xD;
their return, trusting to the vigilance of&#xD;
Clifton to watch their movements in the&#xD;
direction of the falls.&#xD;
Edward's sleep was disturbed by hor-&#xD;
rible dreams. The events which had&#xD;
transpired within the last twenty-four&#xD;
hours, still haunted his imagination. He&#xD;
again traversed every avenue in the cave,&#xD;
and with thrice the labour which the ac-&#xD;
tual search had cost him. He examined&#xD;
each apartment, with that painful preci-&#xD;
sion which the mind exacts, ~vhen the&#xD;
frame has been exhausted with fatigue.&#xD;
Rendered desperate, he resolved to de-&#xD;
scend the cataract. The rope was adjusted,&#xD;
and he hung over the chasm. The spray&#xD;
dashed over him, and his clothes were&#xD;
saturated with water. He swung in the&#xD;
air, at an immense distance from the foot&#xD;
of the falls. The scene was gradually&#xD;
illuminated by some unknown agency,&#xD;
and he was in the act of resting his feet&#xD;
upon the rock, when there fell upon his&#xD;
ear, the sound of discordant laughter.&#xD;
Opening his eyes, he saw Col. Fenton,&#xD;
standing before him.&#xD;

&#xD;
"This is a merry meeting, young gen-&#xD;
tleman; it enables me to pay off old&#xD;
scores, ha! ha!"&#xD;
Clifton sprang to his feet.&#xD;
"Not so fast, the odds are against you.&#xD;
You have afforded me a capital opportuni-&#xD;
ty of revenging the insult put upon me a&#xD;
few years ago ;" and he levelled a pistol&#xD;
at the breast of our hero.&#xD;
"Reserve your threats for one who&#xD;
fears them. What have you (lone with my&#xD;
companions ~&#xD;
"Oh! I have them safe in our domi-&#xD;
nions, where I propose to conduct you. An&#xD;
application of the bastinado will improve&#xD;
your manners&#xD;
"Fool! are you not satisfied with me&#xD;
yet ~ He sprang so suddenly upon Fen-&#xD;
ton, that his weapon was dashed from his&#xD;
hand before he could discharge it. Seiz-&#xD;
ing his foe by the throat, he dragged him&#xD;
towards the precipice, over which he&#xD;
would have hurled him, but fur the inter-&#xD;
position of his followers. After a short&#xD;
but desperate struggle, Edward was bound.&#xD;
Fenton leaned against the rock panting,&#xD;
and deadly pale.&#xD;
"To the secret staircase with him !" he&#xD;
shouted hoarsely. As they disappeared&#xD;
through the stone door, it closed after&#xD;
them, the trap at the bottom, resumed its&#xD;
position, and the basin was in a few mo-&#xD;
ments filled ~vith water.&#xD;
A plan of operations at once suggested&#xD;
itself to the Judge, which he proposed to&#xD;
adopt.&#xD;
Follow we now in the footsteps of the&#xD;
ladies. They had scarcely passed the&#xD;
creek, when they were seized by six&#xD;
armed men, who sprang from behind a&#xD;
hillock, where they had concealed them-&#xD;
selves. Pistols were presented; and with&#xD;
low but stern voice~, the outlaws threat-&#xD;
ened to murder themif they uttered a&#xD;
word. Trembling with alarm, the lamps&#xD;
fell from their hands, arid they were sur-&#xD;
rounded by impenetrable darkness. They&#xD;
were then hurried through the door which&#xD;
was closed after them. Candles were&#xD;
lighted and they ascended a winding stair-&#xD;
case, of some forty steps, which termina-&#xD;
ted in a large apartment. In this 'room&#xD;
were stands of arms, cutlasses, arid pistols,&#xD;
and upon the walls were suspended the&#xD;
enormous horns of moose and deer. It&#xD;
looked like the hall of a feudal baron.&#xD;
An armed sentinel was traversing the&#xD;
room. At the extremity of the apartment,&#xD;
the stone floor' projected over an abyss,&#xD;
more than two hundred feet deep. The&#xD;
prisoners shuddered as they gazed into&#xD;
depths, which would have been imper-&#xD;
&#xD;
121&#xD;
&#xD;
ceptible, but for a flood of light from be-&#xD;
neath. They could distinguish a dozen&#xD;
men, engaged at various amusements.&#xD;
Some were wrestling, others leaping, a&#xD;
third party were pitching quoits, and a&#xD;
fourth played at cards. Altogether it was&#xD;
a scene of gay and careless revelry. One&#xD;
of the captors raised a stone trap in the&#xD;
floor, which disclosed a circular staircase.&#xD;
He motioned for the trembling females to&#xD;
precede him.&#xD;
"We will go no further !" said Helen&#xD;
resolutely.&#xD;
"You must descend the staircase, Miss,"&#xD;
responded a savage-looking fellow, who&#xD;
appeared to be the leader of the party.&#xD;
"What is the cause of this violence ~&#xD;
We have harmed no one. I implore you&#xD;
to let us return ~"&#xD;
"It is impossible; the Captain will ex-&#xD;
plain everything. You ~vill find him a&#xD;
courteous gentleman. Come, proceed; or&#xD;
shall we carry you ~&#xD;
"Let us go, it is useless to resist 1" ob-&#xD;
served Emy.&#xD;
"You are discreet, Miss!"&#xD;
They descended the spiral staircase. a&#xD;
hundred steps, arid found themselves in a&#xD;
room, furnished with all the comfort of a&#xD;
parlour. The floor and walls were cover-&#xD;
ed with deer and bear skins, and from the&#xD;
ceiling was suspended a chandelier, which&#xD;
cast a soft light through the apartment.&#xD;
A table, chairs, and a sofa, occupied vari-&#xD;
ous parts of the floor.&#xD;
"Ladies, you will please be seated,&#xD;
until we report to the Captain. If you do&#xD;
not attempt to escape, no harm will be&#xD;
done you." Retiring to the extremity of&#xD;
the room, they descended another stair-&#xD;
case and disappeared.&#xD;
"What can be the meaning of this l"&#xD;
said Mrs. Foster, as she threw herself&#xD;
upon the sofa.&#xD;
"It is unaccountable," responded Emy.&#xD;
"It seems like a dream. Am I really&#xD;
awake P&#xD;
"I have a faint recollection of a tradi-&#xD;
tion, said Helen, "that this cave was&#xD;
once inhabited by banditti P&#xD;
"Heaven forbid ~ ejaculated Mrs. Fos-&#xD;
ter. "And yet, that it is occupied by men~&#xD;
engaged in some unlawful vocation, the&#xD;
offensive weapons in the room above, and&#xD;
this furnished apartment, are unmistake-&#xD;
able proofs.~~&#xD;
Further conversation was interrupted by&#xD;
the approach of a man, in the prime of&#xD;
life, whose frank countenance and polish-&#xD;
ed address at once reassured them. His&#xD;
form was slight, his features regular, and&#xD;
his eyes dark and piercing.&#xD;
&#xD;

"I regret, ladies, that you have been&#xD;
put to any inconvenience. The Cave has&#xD;
been visited so much recently, that our&#xD;
operations have been greatly impeded. I&#xD;
gave orders for one or two persons to&#xD;
be captured, whose disappearance might&#xD;
create alarm, and keep' others from enter-&#xD;
ing the cavern. Now that they have been&#xD;
so ungallant as to make you prisoners, I&#xD;
shall be forced to detain you for a few&#xD;
days. perhaps a week, until we abandon&#xD;
the Cave for ~&#xD;
"But by what right do you restrain us&#xD;
of our liberty 3 Our absence will occasion&#xD;
the greatest anxiety among our relatives,&#xD;
and you will be seriously punished !" ob-&#xD;
served Helen.&#xD;
"I am pained that circumstances render&#xD;
it absolutely necessary for me to cause&#xD;
you or them uneasiness; but the liberty,&#xD;
if not the lives of my followers, gives me&#xD;
no alternative. I have not the right, hut&#xD;
the power, to control your movements."&#xD;
"You will let us send word to our friends&#xD;
that we are safe, won't you 3" inquired&#xD;
Emy.&#xD;
A smile crossed the handsome features&#xD;
of the stranger, disclosing teeth of per-&#xD;
fect whiteness.&#xD;
"I must uncourteously refuse even that&#xD;
request. But in the mean tim6, I will ex-&#xD;
hibit the curiosities of my realm; your&#xD;
movements shall be unrestrained: my&#xD;
library will be at your disposal; and I trust&#xD;
hereafter you will regard this adventure&#xD;
as a pleasant episode in the journey of&#xD;
life."&#xD;
He pulled a string, '~yhich had been con-&#xD;
cealed by the tapestry of fur, and the dis-&#xD;
tant sound of a bell wa~ heard. In a few&#xD;
moments footsteps approached, and a page&#xD;
entered the room.&#xD;
Here, Carlos, conduct the ladies to the&#xD;
diamond ch~nber. You will please ex-&#xD;
cuse me for the present. I will 1rn eet you&#xD;
again within an hour." He raised his&#xD;
hat and bowed gracefully, as tdey follow-&#xD;
ed the footsteps of the page.&#xD;
"A charming person,: is he not 3" whis-&#xD;
pered Mrs. Foster. "This is becoming&#xD;
romantic !"&#xD;
As they descended, the sound of a&#xD;
waterfall came to their ears, low and&#xD;
musical. At the foot of a long staircase,&#xD;
they found themselves in a circular and&#xD;
dimily-lighted corridor. Turning to the&#xD;
right, they entered through a door, what&#xD;
appeared to be an ante-room. It was iii&#xD;
the form of a parallelogram. The ceiling&#xD;
was not higher than an ordinary dwelling.&#xD;
The floor was elegantly carpeted, and the&#xD;
walls were papered. The furniture was&#xD;
&#xD;
T 0 N.&#xD;
&#xD;
richly carved, and consisted of sofas&#xD;
chairs, a table, marble washstands, and a&#xD;
large mirror.&#xD;
"This appears like enchantment 3" said&#xD;
Helen, after the page had retired.&#xD;
"What elegant furniture, for such a spot&#xD;
as this! Chandeliers which would grace&#xD;
the White House, carpets from Turkey,&#xD;
paper from Paris, marble from Italy !"&#xD;
exclaimed Mrs. Foster.&#xD;
"How regular are the walls, and how&#xD;
even the floor. Can they he of rock ~&#xD;
and Emy stamped her little foot upon the&#xD;
floor. "No, ~ a wooden floor, and the&#xD;
walls are of wood too; why, we are in a&#xD;
house !"&#xD;
By the time they had performed their&#xD;
ablutions, and smoothed their hair at the&#xD;
~rnirror, their jailer host entered the room.&#xD;
"Let us manifest no distrust 3" said Mrs.&#xD;
Foster, as he approached.&#xD;
"Ihope you suffer no inconvenience&#xD;
from your imprisonment, ladies 3"&#xD;
"Only so much as pain for the alarm of&#xD;
our friends, and a sense of personal re-&#xD;
straint, may produce !" replied Mrs. Foster.&#xD;
" What a mystical bower you inhabit,&#xD;
sir 3" remarked Emy. "May 1 ask how&#xD;
long it has been your abode ?"&#xD;
"Almost three years !"&#xD;
"And have you not in that time seen&#xD;
the light of day 3"&#xD;
"Often! I saw you at the Governor's&#xD;
reception, not one year ago.~~&#xD;
"Indeed, and why do you prefer these&#xD;
subterranean apartments ~&#xD;
"Ah! there," he replied archly, "you&#xD;
force me to be mute."&#xD;
"I beg your pardon! I did not desire to&#xD;
obtain possession of your secrets."&#xD;
A distant bell struck nine.&#xD;
"Does that indicate the hour ?~' inquir-&#xD;
ed Mrs. Foster.&#xD;
"Yes, Madam!"&#xD;
"Is it night or day, upon the earth 31&#xD;
have taken no note of time, since we en-&#xD;
tered these dungeons.~~&#xD;
"It is nine o'clock at night. If you&#xD;
will allow me, I will conduct you to the&#xD;
supper-table." They entered another&#xD;
room, where a table was loaded with&#xD;
every delicacy, which could tempt the&#xD;
appetite. Mrs. Foster had no one at home&#xD;
to be alarmed at her absence, and Emy&#xD;
was an orphan; they soon, therefore, re-&#xD;
covered from the terror which their novel&#xD;
position created. Not so Miss Douglass.&#xD;
Her fancy dwelt upon the agony of her&#xD;
father and mother, when the shades of&#xD;
night set in, and she still absent. Poor&#xD;
girl, she little thought her watchful parent&#xD;
was hovering near her!&#xD;
&#xD;
C L I F T 0 N.&#xD;
&#xD;
As soon as they were seated at the ta-&#xD;
ble the stranger withdrew.&#xD;
"Shall I do the honours 3" inquired Mrs.&#xD;
Foster. "Helen, do eat. You must not&#xD;
be alarmed; we shall be released, at most,&#xD;
in a few days.~~&#xD;
~' In a few days.!~~ responded the&#xD;
maiden, with tearful eyes. "What will&#xD;
my poor mother think has become of me 3&#xD;
Besides, what assurance have we that our&#xD;
persons are safe while we remain in the&#xD;
po~ver of these lawless men 3"&#xD;
"I am certain we can suffer no harm as&#xD;
long as this stranger is our protector."&#xD;
"How powerless will a single arm be-&#xD;
come, when opposed by a score of des-&#xD;
perate outlaws! The leader of a gang like&#xD;
this holds his authority by an uncertain&#xD;
tenure."&#xD;
"I think our friends will come to our&#xD;
rescue," said Emy.&#xD;
How can they3 If they discover the&#xD;
secret door, every avenue hither is guard-&#xD;
ed. There is no alternative for us but to&#xD;
remain, with what courage we can muster,&#xD;
until the Captain of the band releases us."&#xD;
After they had concluded their meal, the&#xD;
page conducted them into the library. The&#xD;
walls of this room were papered with oak&#xD;
panel. The large book-case was filled&#xD;
with standard works. Josephus ranged&#xD;
side by side with Scott's novels. Gibbons'&#xD;
Rome, and Byron's works, the Spectator,&#xD;
and Shakspeare's plays, Cooper's novels&#xD;
and Hume~s History, were crowded upon&#xD;
the shelves; while Bulwer, Dickens, Sue,&#xD;
and Irving, were represented in the gene-&#xD;
ral mass of literature. Emerging from the&#xD;
library they entered a corridor. The roar&#xD;
of the falls was now distiiictly heard.&#xD;
What produces that noise, Carlos 3"&#xD;
inquired Mrs. Foster.&#xD;
"It is the descent of the creek above&#xD;
into the chasm. Would you like to see&#xD;
it 3"&#xD;
Threading the corridor for about twenty&#xD;
yards, they turned abruptly to the right,&#xD;
and descending a shQrt flight of steps, the&#xD;
page threw open a door, and the asto-&#xD;
nished females found themselves behind&#xD;
the sheet, and near the chasm into which&#xD;
the water was precipitated from a height&#xD;
of more than two hundred feet. The con-&#xD;
cussion was reverberated in thundering&#xD;
echoes through the vaulted, cavern. A&#xD;
cloud of spray hovered around the falls.&#xD;
into which the rays of the candle could&#xD;
scarcely penetrate. While they were en-&#xD;
deavouring to pierce the gloom, a flood of&#xD;
light was cast upon the descendingcolumn.&#xD;
From whence it emanated they could not&#xD;
divine, but its effulgence revealed, not&#xD;
&#xD;
123&#xD;
&#xD;
only the outlines of the falls, but formed a&#xD;
thousand miniature rainbows in the flash-&#xD;
ing spray.&#xD;
Far above them, the projecting rock&#xD;
over which the water poured, appeared&#xD;
to tremble, and the ladies shuddered as&#xD;
they withdrew their eyes. Helen cast&#xD;
another fearful glance upwards. She ut-&#xD;
tered a piercing shriek, and exclaimed,&#xD;
"It is falling !" They all started back,&#xD;
except the page, whose eyes were riveted&#xD;
upon the overhanging cliff He put his&#xD;
fingers to his mouth and uttered a shrill&#xD;
whistle. Three men entered the room,&#xD;
whose attention was directed above.&#xD;
Helen fearfully raised her eyes again, and&#xD;
trembled with horror as they rested upon&#xD;
a human form suspended in the air. The&#xD;
mist concealed from her view the rope by&#xD;
which he was descending, and the hgure&#xD;
appeared, to her over-heated imagination,&#xD;
the tangible creation of a disordered brain.&#xD;
With straining eyeballs she gazed upimn&#xD;
the phantom, as it slowly approached the&#xD;
foot of the falls. Her blood congealed,&#xD;
a~nd the pulsation ceased to beat, as she&#xD;
recognized the countenance of Dr. Fielding.&#xD;
Two of tha men hastily disappeared over&#xD;
the platform, which was elevated a dozen&#xD;
feet above the small area between the foot&#xD;
of the cataract and the rock upon which&#xD;
they were standing. Fielding struggled&#xD;
unavailingly to reach the platform. For&#xD;
one moment it appeared as though he&#xD;
would succeed, and then he swung out&#xD;
towards the sheet. Helen darted to the&#xD;
edge of the precipice, but too late to aid&#xD;
him. The rope was severed by the re-&#xD;
maining outlaw, and the form of her lover&#xD;
disappeared. With a faint cry she sank&#xD;
to the earth.&#xD;
"Bear her to the star chamber,~~ said&#xD;
the voice of the Captain. Mrs. Foster and&#xD;
Emy hung over the form of their friend.&#xD;
It was long before th'e blood returned to&#xD;
her cheek, and the drooping lids disclosed&#xD;
the languid eyes.&#xD;
The apartment had evidently been pre&#xD;
pared for their reception. It was more&#xD;
gorgeously furnished than any one they&#xD;
had hitherto seen. The furniture was&#xD;
rosewood, and the curtains which over-&#xD;
hung the beds were brocatelle. The soft&#xD;
and downy beds were covered with spot-&#xD;
less linen. Upon the marble table w~re&#xD;
several standard works. They were started&#xD;
as they beheld the glittering blades and&#xD;
jewelled handles of three daggers. I&#xD;
"'Tis an assurance of our safety," aid&#xD;
Mrs. Foster. "In whatever desperate&#xD;
enterprises this person ma y be engaged&#xD;
I believe we are safe from viol~ace.&#xD;

&#xD;
Let us examine this window; it opens,&#xD;
upon a balcony. Why, girls, come&#xD;
here! We have been transported to the&#xD;
front of the falls." They were separated&#xD;
from the sheet by less than twenty yards.&#xD;
The balcony projected from the side of a&#xD;
perpendicular rock, at an elevation of se-&#xD;
venty feet from the earth, and enabled&#xD;
them to take in the overwhelming gran-&#xD;
deur of the scene. The light still fell upon&#xD;
the wat6r, whose sparl~ling jets glittered&#xD;
like diamonds in its resplendent rays.&#xD;
They had a view of the falls from the&#xD;
point where they gently curved over the&#xD;
dizzy height, to the chasm into which they&#xD;
were precipitated. At the top, the river&#xD;
was not more than ten feet wide, but&#xD;
spread out in its descent to more than&#xD;
double that width.&#xD;
The bell long since tolled the hour of&#xD;
midnight, and the exhausted females&#xD;
barred their door, and threw themselves&#xD;
upon the beds. Mrs. Foster and Emy&#xD;
struggled ineffectually against the demands&#xD;
of exhausted nature. Their senses were&#xD;
lulled by the music of the cataract as&#xD;
penetrated the apartment, and they soon&#xD;
lost the consciousness of danger in a pro.&#xD;
found sleep. Helen recalled the events&#xD;
which had transpired since she entered&#xD;
the Cave. An age had glided past in that&#xD;
brief period. Her senses refused to slum-&#xD;
ber, and turning over the pages of Lam-&#xD;
phere's Classical Dictionary, she confound-&#xD;
ed the fabulous doctrines of mythology&#xD;
with the mystical wonders of the cavern.&#xD;
She took up the dagger, an~ scrutinizing&#xD;
us polished surface mentally exclaimed-&#xD;
"Of what fiendish crime hast thou been&#xD;
the unconscious agents or art thou yet to&#xD;
receive the first impression of blood: per-&#xD;
haps of mine I" and a cold shudder ran&#xD;
through her frame. "Or, if not, in defence&#xD;
of that which is far dearer-my honour !"&#xD;
There came floating upon the air ~the&#xD;
glorious music of a brass band. Thr~w-&#xD;
ing a shawl over ber shoulders, she stepped&#xD;
upon the balcony. No one was visible.&#xD;
She listened with enraptured senses to the&#xD;
soothing melody, as it came in swelling&#xD;
notes or softened cadences upon her ear.&#xD;
The tune was changed, and a warlike&#xD;
blast filled the cavern. As she was en-&#xD;
deavouring to ascertain from whence the&#xD;
music proceeded, two figures appeared&#xD;
upon the balcony to her right. Her heart&#xD;
bounded with joy as she recocwnised the&#xD;
form of Dr. Fielding. He waved' his hand-&#xD;
kerchief. At that instant his companion&#xD;
raised his arm; the lights were extin-&#xD;
guished, and the scene was shrouded in&#xD;
impenetrable gloom. She rejoiced at the&#xD;
&#xD;
escape of Dr. Fielding, and with an as-&#xD;
surance of safety retired to her couch.&#xD;
As she adjusted her hair and rested her&#xD;
cheek upon the pillow, a strain of music,&#xD;
wild and plaintive, seemed to float in the&#xD;
air. Now approaching the balcony, and&#xD;
then receding until the mellow noten were&#xD;
faintly heard. Mrs. Foster slightly moved,&#xD;
her lips parted, and she whispered, "'Tis&#xD;
heavenly ~ Helen's eyes closed, and she&#xD;
dreamed of manly figures floating' in the&#xD;
air in the vain attempt to rescue her from&#xD;
imprisonment.&#xD;

Resistance was unavailing, and he en-&#xD;
tered a gloomy cell which had been walled&#xD;
up, and into which the air was admitted&#xD;
through a small opening. The guard re-&#xD;
tired, and their footsteps were heard ring-&#xD;
ing upon the rock path. Half an hour&#xD;
might have elapse , when Clifton heard&#xD;
his name pronounced in a whisper.&#xD;
"Massa Clifton, come to de door !"&#xD;
"Well, Sambo, you went over the falls&#xD;
in safety I"&#xD;
"Yes, massa, by gad; but I like to got&#xD;

"Where are the ladies I Have you&#xD;

"Them well. Dey hab good room:&#xD;

"Where is your master I"&#xD;
"Here in de room yoner, sleeping&#xD;
soundly"&#xD;
"When he wakes let him know my&#xD;
situation. Tell him I am in the power of&#xD;
an enemy who will not hesitate to do me&#xD;
an injury.~~&#xD;
"Sambo will tend to it."&#xD;
When his slave had communicated to&#xD;
Dr. Fielding the situation of his friend, he&#xD;
at once sought the young leader. He&#xD;
found him in a room connected with the&#xD;
library, exhibiting to Mrs. Foster and her&#xD;
companions some rare paintings and sta-&#xD;
tuary.&#xD;
"Dr. Fielding, lain ~w gidd to see you !"&#xD;
exclaimed ~ as she 'advanced to&#xD;
meet him, with a joyous smile.&#xD;
"I as~are you the pleasure is mutual.&#xD;
Mrs. Foster, Emy, how are you both I"&#xD;
Quite xvell2 after a refreshing sleep.~~&#xD;
"You must join me in a petition to our&#xD;
courteous host-for he acts the character&#xD;
w:th more grace than that ofjailer-to re-&#xD;
lease Clifton from a dungeon.&#xD;
"Clifton in confinement !" exclaimed&#xD;
the ladies. "Oh, sir, you will release&#xD;
him"-&#xD;
"Pardon me for interrupting you, ladies;&#xD;
your request is granted. Here, Carlos-&#xD;
order the warden to release the prisoner.&#xD;
'Tis his work; a second disobedience of&#xD;
orders." And his brow gathered into a&#xD;
heavy frown as he left the apartment.&#xD;
"These paintings are exquisite! What&#xD;
think you of this copy of Titian's Venus !"&#xD;
"It is really beautiful !"&#xD;
"An'! this representation of the Ma-&#xD;
donna I"&#xD;
"Is evidently by one of the old masters.&#xD;
What grace in the expression, what mild-&#xD;
ess in the eye !"&#xD;
"Mary, Queen of Scots; well executed.&#xD;
She must have been irresistible. Catha-&#xD;
rine de Medicis; how imperious the look.&#xD;
Napoleon; the stamp of greatness is un-&#xD;
mistakeably disclosed. Cromwell, the great&#xD;
statesman, and the remorseless hypocrite.&#xD;
The serious face of the first Charles, and&#xD;
the calm and resolute countenance of&#xD;
Washington, all well executed. Our host&#xD;
is evidently a connoisseur. This bust of&#xD;
Webster is faultless, this of Clay not so&#xD;
good, but passable. Here is the deter-&#xD;
mined physiognomy of old Bullion, in con-&#xD;
tact with the iron visage of his great rival,&#xD;
the South Carolina nullifier. A statue of&#xD;
&#xD;
the first conqueror of Italy, imported from&#xD;
Europe. Let me pull aside this curtain.&#xD;
The three Graces! They are beautiful.&#xD;
No statuary that I have ever beheld equals&#xD;
this group."&#xD;
They wandered through the apartments&#xD;
towards the falls.&#xD;
"Why, Clifton, my dear fellow, thrice&#xD;
welcome !"&#xD;
Our hero was cordially greeted by his&#xD;
four associates. The page announced that&#xD;
breakfast awaited them. As they were&#xD;
seated at the table, Edward recounted to&#xD;
his com p anions the events which had&#xD;
transpire d since they were separated.&#xD;
"And where is father now I" inquired&#xD;
Helen.&#xD;
"I cannot inform you. From the posi-&#xD;
tion which he occupied, he must have ob-&#xD;
served the secret door. I did not claim&#xD;
assistance from him, because, in the event&#xD;
of his capture, our friends without would&#xD;
have no clue to our place of imprisonment.&#xD;
What number of men hold possession of&#xD;
the cavern I"&#xD;
"At least a score" replied Fielding.&#xD;
"Are they engaged in some desperate&#xD;
enterprise I"&#xD;
Unquestionably! else why the secret&#xD;
door, these furnished apartments, and the&#xD;
seizure of our persons I"&#xD;
"'T4s strange,~~ responded Edward,&#xD;
musingly, "that an organized band should&#xD;
exist in the vicinity of Stamford."&#xD;
"What can be the object of the associa-&#xD;
tion I"&#xD;
"I cannot divine. It would be difficult&#xD;
to connect anything dishonourable with&#xD;
the courteous leader of the band."&#xD;
"I will vouch for his' honour," said&#xD;
Mrs. Foster. "A belted knight could not&#xD;
be more loyal in his bearing. Besides,&#xD;
these rooms are proof that he possesses a&#xD;
refined and cultivated taste."&#xD;
They returned to the library, for the&#xD;
purpose of re-examining the paintings.&#xD;
Fielding again lifted the curtain which&#xD;
concealed the Graqes. They ~vere gone!&#xD;
What they thought was one side of the&#xD;
room, was suddenly elevated, and dis-&#xD;
closed a scene that appeared like the crea-&#xD;
tion of enchantment. In the centre of the&#xD;
area was a fountain, whose innumerable&#xD;
jets caused a gentle shower to descend&#xD;
upon that part of the grounds. Countless&#xD;
lamps were suspended from the vault,&#xD;
casting a flood of light throughout the vast&#xD;
arcade. Half-a-dozen statues, including&#xD;
the three Graces, occupied different posi-&#xD;
tions upon the stage. Those in front of&#xD;
the fountain stood revealed in all their&#xD;
classic elegance, as chaste and pure as&#xD;
&#xD;

Powers' statue of the Greek Slave, while&#xD;
the figures beyond were softly shaded~y&#xD;
the misty drapery of the waterfall. The~&#xD;
curtain tell, ~but rose again in a few mo-&#xD;
ments. The scene was changed. Six&#xD;
powerful gladiators wete in the act of&#xD;
seizing the helpless nymphs, who had&#xD;
timidly shrouded their forms in robes of&#xD;
gauze.&#xD;
"We have been deceived !" exclaimed&#xD;
Fielding, in amazement. "Our faultless&#xD;
statues are living, breathing mortals."&#xD;
"This was the statuary, Doctor, which&#xD;
you have never seen equalled! This is&#xD;
your boasted skill in anatomy and physiog-&#xD;
nomy !" said Mrs. Foster; and ~he laughed&#xD;
merrily.&#xD;
The artistes now gave a succession of&#xD;
beautiful tableaux. The Capture of the&#xD;
Sabines-Bacchus at his Revels-The&#xD;
Elopement of Helen-The meeting of An-&#xD;
tony and Cleopatra-The Execution of&#xD;
Anne Boleyn, and the Separation of Jo-&#xD;
sephine and the Man of Destiny. When&#xD;
the curtain rose for the last tin~e, the in-&#xD;
spiriting notes of a polka filled the arcade.&#xD;
It was danced with exquisite grace for&#xD;
several minutes, when the females were&#xD;
borne aloft by some imperceptible agency.&#xD;
When the eyes of the astonished spec-&#xD;
tators were directed to the floor, the gladia-&#xD;
tors had also disappeared. The lights&#xD;
were extinguished, and the curtain fell.&#xD;
Before they could give expression to&#xD;
their wonder at these extraordinary exhi-&#xD;
bitions, the wildest commotion arose in&#xD;
the corridor beneath the library window.&#xD;
They saw the leader of the band standing&#xD;
upon a platform slightly elevated above&#xD;
the floor, upon which he had just step~ied,&#xD;
from what appeared to be his private&#xD;
study. In front of him were a dozen men,&#xD;
at the head of whom Clifton recognized&#xD;
his arch enemy.&#xD;
"What want you, Col. Fenton l" said&#xD;
the clear and sonorous voice of the com-&#xD;
mander.&#xD;
"I want Edward Clifton, whom you I&#xD;
1~~&#xD;
have rescued from my grasp.&#xD;
"And to accomplish that object you&#xD;
have not only induced these misguided&#xD;
men to revolt, but have violated your own&#xD;
oath."&#xD;
At this allusion to a breach of discipline,&#xD;
the least resolute of the party hung their&#xD;
heads.&#xD;
"Prate not to me of revolt !" cried the'&#xD;
enraged Fenton. "I no longer obey your&#xD;
orders until Clifton is delivered into my&#xD;
hands."&#xD;
"For the last time I order you to retire,"&#xD;
said the young leader, with folded arms&#xD;
&#xD;
iT ON.&#xD;
&#xD;
and bent brow, the swelling veins of&#xD;
which indicated the violence of his pas-&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
"Never !" thundered the exasperated&#xD;
subordinate. "Nay, frown not at me! your&#xD;
minions are not within call, and you are&#xD;
in my power.~~&#xD;
"Fool! theii die in your madness."&#xD;
His last words were swallowed by the&#xD;
explosion of his pistol and the awe-&#xD;
stricken spectators beheld the arms of Col.&#xD;
Fenton, for an instant, wildly grasping at&#xD;
the impalpable air, when he fell to the&#xD;
earth. A few convulsive struggles were&#xD;
followed by a quivering of the limbs, the&#xD;
eyes rolled wildly in their sockets, and&#xD;
then all was still.&#xD;
"So perish the insubordinate. Who&#xD;
will be the next victim ?" said the stern&#xD;
voice of the coriander.&#xD;
A minute of profound silence ensued,&#xD;
while they gazed upon the stiffening form&#xD;
of the dead, and then by one of those&#xD;
sudden transitions from fear to reckless-&#xD;
ness, they prepared to revenge the blood&#xD;
of their comrade.&#xD;
"1 will be the next victim !" exclaimed&#xD;
a gigantic Scot. "And I!"" And I!"&#xD;
"Down with him! he is but one man:&#xD;
shall he shoot us do~vn with impunity l"&#xD;
They began to gather around the young&#xD;
chief; whose slight form was motionless,&#xD;
as with folded arms and scornful eye he&#xD;
watched their movements. Those nearest&#xD;
his person, still restrained by the sanctity&#xD;
of delegated authority, confined their hos-&#xD;
tility to gesticulations: but those in the&#xD;
rear attempted to reach his bosom with&#xD;
their daggers.&#xD;
Edward and Fielding were on the point&#xD;
of starting to his relief, when lie clapped&#xD;
his hands. A vast sliding door rolled&#xD;
back, and two pieces of artillery were&#xD;
pointed at the mutineers. Before they&#xD;
had recovered from the alarm occasioned&#xD;
by this unexpected diversion, twenty rifie~&#xD;
were levelled at their shrinki~g~forms.&#xD;
"When will you learn it is absolute&#xD;
folly, to struggle against my authority l&#xD;
Throw down your weapons. There, now;&#xD;
cross your hands. Major, place these des-&#xD;
peradoes in irons, until I can determine&#xD;
their fate. Begone.~~ And with an im-&#xD;
perious gesture, he waved the crestfallen&#xD;
rioters from his presence. "Remove the&#xD;
body of the mutineer. Since the warfare&#xD;
of Milton's angels,~~ he continued in a&#xD;
melancholy voice, "so perish all who&#xD;
assail the established and necessary regu-&#xD;
lations of law and order." He gazed for&#xD;
a moment upon the unconscious clay, and&#xD;
then directed his glance to the library.&#xD;

"What rumbling sound is that beneath&#xD;
our feet'?"&#xD;
"Why the falls have disappeared."&#xD;
They gazed upward. Nothing was seen&#xD;
but a few small rivulets trickling from the&#xD;
brow of the precipice.&#xD;
"The river is descending through the&#xD;
basin. He is delivering your message,&#xD;
~ said Edward.&#xD;
The water now gushed from beneath&#xD;
their feet, and flowed into the channel&#xD;
several yards below.&#xD;
"Come hither." said the page.&#xD;
Opening a sliding door concealed by&#xD;
the tapestry, he conducted them to another&#xD;
room, which had evidently been just de-&#xD;
serted. Several articles of a lady's toilette&#xD;
were upon the bureau and table, and,&#xD;
standing beside a chair was an embroidery&#xD;
frame. Scissors, thread, and scraps of&#xD;
silk were lying upon the carpet. They&#xD;
followed the page to the balcony. From&#xD;
an immense height, the river descended&#xD;
in a succession of cascades, and, con-&#xD;
fined as it was in a narrow channel, the&#xD;
water was lashed into a white foam.&#xD;
Lamps were arranged from( the foot to the&#xD;
summit of the falls, and, together with the&#xD;
overhanging cliffs, formed a beautiful&#xD;
vista. While their eyes were riveted upon&#xD;
the descending flood, there appeared, just&#xD;
where the first cascade was seen curving&#xD;
overtherockstheshadowyoutlinesofa&#xD;
child rapidly gliding along the crest of the&#xD;
waves. She was clothed in the habili-&#xD;
ments of a fairy, and balanced herself&#xD;
upon one foot with ease and gracefulness.&#xD;
Her eyes were directed to the wondering&#xD;
spectators, and at intervals she kissed her&#xD;
hand. Although she was borne upon the&#xD;
water, and her form was occasionally en-&#xD;
veloped in the spray, yet she did not touch&#xD;
the raging flood. She continued to de-&#xD;
scend, now moving with a velocity which&#xD;
made the ladies hold their breath, and&#xD;
then gliding slowly down the rapids.&#xD;
Pausing upon the crest of a fall, scarcely&#xD;
more than forty feet from the balcony, she&#xD;
bowed gracefully, and then vanished in&#xD;
what appeared to be the solid rock. Be-&#xD;
fore they had withdrawn their eyes from&#xD;
the elevation, she reappeared for an in-&#xD;
stant at the point where they had first&#xD;
beheld her.&#xD;
"Whatever may be the object of&#xD;
this singular man in fitting up the cavern&#xD;
with so much elegance, he certainly&#xD;
delights in the magical," said Dr. Field-&#xD;
"Yes; and he practices it to some pur-&#xD;
pose. What with paintings-your statu-&#xD;
&#xD;
ary-nymphs, and fairies, he surpasses&#xD;
the mystical wonders of the Ravels."&#xD;
~ exclaimed Emy. "Is not&#xD;
that music?"&#xD;
About half way to the summit of the&#xD;
falls, they saw the form of a lady descend-&#xD;
ing from the vault towards the river. She&#xD;
was seated at a harp, and her round ala-&#xD;
baster arms, glided with exquisite trace&#xD;
along the strings. Before she had execu-&#xD;
ted the prelude, the river had disappeared,&#xD;
and the channel was empty. At first, the&#xD;
notes floated softly towards them; but as&#xD;
the harpist proceeded, as if inspired by&#xD;
the melody, she touched the strings with&#xD;
greater power. The song was from the&#xD;
opera of Maria de Rohan -the ronda&#xD;
which the Countess sings when apprised&#xD;
of her husband's safety. As the last notes&#xD;
were borne to the eager listeners, the&#xD;
artiste started to her feet. The flood was&#xD;
again pouring overthe precipice, and rapid-&#xD;
ly descended one cascade after another.&#xD;
She gazed wildly around, and her counte-&#xD;
nance was blanched with terror. She&#xD;
occupied one of those level rests that&#xD;
intervened between the shoots. As the&#xD;
foaming river appeared along the brow of&#xD;
the rock above her, she seemed paralysed&#xD;
with terror, and in the extremity of her&#xD;
fears, the unfortunate female sank from&#xD;
their view. Helen clasped her hands, and&#xD;
exclaimed, "She will be lost! she will&#xD;
be lost!"&#xD;
"No power on earth can save ~ re-&#xD;
sponded the Doctor, solemnly. "She will&#xD;
be dashed in pieces ere she reaches us&#xD;
Down, down rolled the river, as if&#xD;
affrighted at its own velocity. They gazed&#xD;
eagerly upon its foaming crests, but could&#xD;
obtain 110 trace of the unfortunate lady.&#xD;
Sadly they turned away, and were leaving&#xD;
the balcony, when the notes of a harp&#xD;
swelled above the roaring, waters. Look-&#xD;
ing upward, they saw the smiling face of&#xD;
the harpist, as she slowly ascended to-&#xD;
wards the vault, and disappeared.&#xD;
"It is too bad to sport thus with our~&#xD;
sympathies !," said Helen, pettishly.&#xD;
"Why, you would not have her drowned,&#xD;
to make that a tragedy which was only&#xD;
intended for our amusement !" replied&#xD;
Clifton.&#xD;
"No, but I would not have her pre-&#xD;
tend to be s6 much alarmed. My nerves&#xD;
are not yet quiet !"&#xD;
The notes of a guitar next stole upon&#xD;
their ears. Scarcely a dozen feet could&#xD;
separate them from the artist; still he was&#xD;
invisible. The strings were touched&#xD;
with much skill, and a manly voice sang&#xD;
the following words with exquisite feeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
In dreams I see thee by my Bide;&#xD;
Again I clasp that yielding form:&#xD;
The rapture of the lingering kiss&#xD;
Is on my lip and cheek, still warm.&#xD;
Upon my brow how sweetly steals&#xD;
Again, the fragrance of thy breath,&#xD;
As when we pledged, br ill or weal,&#xD;
Our love to each, through life till death.&#xD;
That lovely arm is gently thrown&#xD;
Around my neck, and lingers still,&#xD;
While blushes gather on thy cheek,&#xD;
And tears ofjoy those eyelids fill.&#xD;
I try to kiss those roseate lips,&#xD;
And press again that breathing form;&#xD;
The warm caress is net returned.&#xD;
I wake-alas I the vision's gone.&#xD;
"What witchery is this, and to ~vhat&#xD;
magical arts is our attention next to be&#xD;
directed ?" inquired Mrs. Foster.&#xD;
'~Why, you seem to think the resources&#xD;
of our host are exhaustless," said Helen.&#xD;
"Yes, and I expect each feat to be more&#xD;
startling than the one which preceded it !"&#xD;
"What an unconscionable woman&#xD;
Emy returned to her room, and the rest&#xD;
separated ilItO pairs, and wandered through&#xD;
the apartments and along the spacious&#xD;
halls.&#xD;
"Who would suppose, Mr. Clifton, that&#xD;
real life could present such an enchanting&#xD;
scene&#xD;
"You are pleased with it, Mrs. Fos-&#xD;
ter ?"&#xD;
"Nothing that was ever conceived by&#xD;
the most fruitful imagination, can rival the&#xD;
splendour of this subterranean abode. I&#xD;
could linger here for ever."&#xD;
"Doubtless, after it is abandoned by its&#xD;
present occupant, you will induce the&#xD;
General to remove his quarters hither?"&#xD;
"I would make the attempt, if this&#xD;
atmosphere is not destructive to health&#xD;
and complexion."&#xD;
"It is not extraordinary that you prize&#xD;
the latter highly!"&#xD;
"Do you think not?"&#xD;
~ No! You could have no cause for&#xD;
alarm, however; this air would benefit&#xD;
both, if indeed either could be improved."&#xD;
"How flattering !"&#xD;
"Nay, how truthful. Cast your eyes&#xD;
upon those rounded arms, an~ along that&#xD;
figure which is not inclined a shade too&#xD;
much to embonpoint! Why, they indi-&#xD;
cate perfect health! And for the com-&#xD;
plexion, come to this mirror-yes do-&#xD;
there now, is truth flattering?"&#xD;
The mercury gave back a face radiant&#xD;
with blushes.&#xD;
"You have no right to call the blood to&#xD;
my cheek."&#xD;
"Not if it occasions pain !"&#xD;
"How dare you insinuate that pleasure&#xD;
causes it ?"&#xD;
They returned to the library. Mrs. Fos-&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
ter seated herself upon the damask sofa.&#xD;
The sound of the distant cataract was&#xD;
faintly heard. A solar lamp, upon the&#xD;
centre table, cast its mellow light through&#xD;
the room, and Edward was exhibiting to&#xD;
his fair companion some steel engrav-&#xD;
ings. Strains of music, softened bydis-&#xD;
tance, entered the apartment. The notes&#xD;
were plaintive and low, and floated with&#xD;
overpowering sweetness upon the air.&#xD;
"We have been surveying the apart-&#xD;
ment, Mrs. Foster, which was assigned to&#xD;
you last night. It does not equal in mag-&#xD;
nificence the three rooms which are to be&#xD;
devoted to yourself and the maidens, for&#xD;
the futnre !"&#xD;
"Are we to occupy different chambers ?"&#xD;
"So it s~ms. I presume one was&#xD;
assigned to you last night, in deference&#xD;
to your fears."&#xD;
" Doubtless."&#xD;
"The apartments of Clifton and myself&#xD;
are contiguotls to yours, so you have no&#xD;
cause of alarm."&#xD;
The stranger entered the library with a&#xD;
young and beautiful woman leaning upon&#xD;
his arm. She held by the hand a child,&#xD;
about three years old, who gazed timidly&#xD;
around him.&#xD;
"Will you allow me to present my&#xD;
wife, ladies ?"&#xD;
"Certainly, I am happy to make her&#xD;
acquaintance," said Mrs. Foster, as she&#xD;
extended her hand. "Although we are&#xD;
semi-prisoners, madam, still we shall never&#xD;
forget the courtesy of your husband."&#xD;
"I am happy to find he has sustained&#xD;
his reputation. I know ~ie regrets the&#xD;
necessity which forces him to detain you."&#xD;
"Probably more than I do, for I have&#xD;
been confounded, yet delighted, with all&#xD;
I have seen."&#xD;
"The feats were all invented by my&#xD;
husband, for the purpose of amusing me,&#xD;
at times when the recollections of home&#xD;
weighed heavily upon my mind."&#xD;
"They are alike creditable to his taste,&#xD;
and his affections. Have we witnessed&#xD;
them all ?"&#xD;
"Not half. The vast dimensions of the&#xD;
Cave afford full scope for his powers. But&#xD;
your dinner awaits you. You, no doubt,&#xD;
find that air and exercise give you excel-&#xD;
lent appetites."&#xD;
" Will you not join us?"&#xD;
"Thank you, no! My husband and I&#xD;
dine later, and always alone. Au revoir."&#xD;
"A charming person, is she not'?"&#xD;
"So lady-like and refined."&#xD;
Mrs. Foster was more than ordinarily&#xD;
vivacious. Her wit was keen and sarcas-&#xD;
tic, and she launched it at every one ex-&#xD;

cept Edward. Him she addressed at first&#xD;
in a constrained voice, and then her man-&#xD;
ner became more frank. Her large black&#xD;
eyes flashed upon all the rest. She did&#xD;
not raise them to his countenance.&#xD;
Why, you seem inspired, Mrs. Foster,"&#xD;
said Fielding; "I have never seen, even&#xD;
you, so brilliant before."&#xD;
I can now see how poor Ellen is tor-&#xD;
tured !" thought Clifton. "Never mind,&#xD;
madam, I'll square her accounts with you&#xD;
yet."&#xD;
His bearing became more frigid as hers&#xD;
softened, until a reply more than ordinarily&#xD;
caustic induced her to look him full ~n the&#xD;
face, with a wondering, and half-reproach-&#xD;
ful glance. They were no longer es-&#xD;
tranged.&#xD;
Returning to the library, they were met&#xD;
by the stranger. "I shall detain you no&#xD;
1onger,~~ he observed. "The recent mu-&#xD;
tiny postpones for an indefinite period my&#xD;
departure from the cavern. There is one&#xD;
request I must make, prior to your re-&#xD;

"Name it," said Fielding; "we can re-'&#xD;

"To the extent of your power prevent&#xD;
all attempts to explore this part of the&#xD;
Cave until I consent."&#xD;
" We will.&#xD;
"I can defend myself against any force&#xD;
which may be brought against me, but I&#xD;
wish to avoid a useless sacrifice of life.&#xD;
For your own satisfaction, I here declare,&#xD;
upon the honour of a gentleman, that our&#xD;
operations do not, in the slightest degree,&#xD;
violate the laws of the land."&#xD;
"I am glad to hear it !" said Edwa~d,&#xD;
warmly. "This assurance makes me still&#xD;
more grateful for your kind interference&#xD;
in my behalf."&#xD;
The adieus were spoken, and with sad&#xD;
countenances they emerged from the se-&#xD;
cret door, and proceeded towards the&#xD;
mouth of the Cave. They found Judge&#xD;
Douglass and Davidson awaiting their&#xD;
exit, with horses to convey them to Stam-&#xD;

THE Presidential struggle had com-&#xD;
menced.&#xD;
The electoral candidates had mounted&#xD;
the stump, and barbecues and mass meet-&#xD;
ings ~vere the order of the day. The lead-&#xD;
ing issue of the canvass was the policy of&#xD;
annexing Texas to the United States.&#xD;
That question illustrated the instability of&#xD;
public opinion. The opposition of Mr.&#xD;
Van Buren to the measure was made the&#xD;
pretext for quietly laying him upon the&#xD;
shelf; yet it is doubtful if the overwhelm-&#xD;
ing selfishness of the man did not eon-&#xD;
tribute more largely to his defeat. The&#xD;
young democracy were anxious to get rid&#xD;
of him upon any terms. They regarded&#xD;
him as a political incubus, who woold al-&#xD;
ways bring defeat upon the party. De-&#xD;
spised at the North, distrusted at the South,&#xD;
he could still rally a few devoted friends,&#xD;
while the masses were far from enthusi-&#xD;
astic in his support.&#xD;
The whigs were zealous in the cause of&#xD;
Mr. Clay. His nomination in 1844 was a.&#xD;
foregone conclusion, notwithstanding his&#xD;
opposition to the annexation of Texas.&#xD;
His sympathies must have been favoura-&#xD;
ble to the extension of the "area of free-&#xD;
dom." Such had been the tenor of his&#xD;
public action. While Secretary of State&#xD;
he endeavored to acquire Texas from the&#xD;
central government. What could have&#xD;
changed his opinions when the "lone&#xD;
star" had become "practically free and~&#xD;
independent?" It is the prevailing opi~&#xD;
rii'on that every politician studies the mairt&#xD;
chance, and he may have supposed that&#xD;
the Northern States would turn the scale in&#xD;
the presidential contest. His position was&#xD;
truly embarrassing. The Southern demo-&#xD;
cracy assailed the letters which he wrote&#xD;
from time to time upon the Texas ques-&#xD;
tion, with the utmost violence. From the&#xD;
date of his Raleigh manifesto, to the&#xD;
seventh of November, he fulminated half&#xD;
a-dozen decrees; but while he failed to&#xD;
~fihisfy the abolitionists, he greatly em-&#xD;
barrassed his Southern friends. * Mr. Clay&#xD;
did not correctly inter p ret public sentiment&#xD;
when he stated, in his letter of May 9,&#xD;
1844, that the annexation of Texas was&#xD;
" not called for by any general expression&#xD;
of public opinion." In the slaveholding&#xD;
States the project was almost universally&#xD;
approved, and the extraordinary spectacle&#xD;
was witnessed of whigs and democrats&#xD;
assembling in the same convention to ex-&#xD;
press their approval of the contemplated&#xD;
&#xD;
union. In the North, the question was not&#xD;
so popular, but even there it had many&#xD;
advocates, riot~ithstanding the opposition&#xD;
of Mr. Van Buren.&#xD;
It did not, however, exercise so much&#xD;
influence upon the ballot-box as its friends&#xD;
had vainly supposed. In fact, the result&#xD;
proved the fallacy of all human calcula-&#xD;
tions. In tbe Southern States the admirers&#xD;
of Mr. Clay changed front, and from zea-&#xD;
lous advocates of annexation became its&#xD;
fiercest opponents. Mr. Clay carried every&#xD;
Southern State which he could safely count&#xD;
upon if the Texas question had not be-&#xD;
come an element in the canvass; while&#xD;
Mr. Polk did not lose an electoral vote at&#xD;
the North by his favoring the annexation&#xD;
of slave territory. The New York aboli-&#xD;
-tionists did not display their usual tact.&#xD;
Instead of sapping the foundation of south-&#xD;
ern power by opposing an enlargement of&#xD;
its limits, they cast their votes for Bimey,&#xD;
and thus elevated an avowed extensionist&#xD;
to the presidential chair, by the election of&#xD;
Polk and the defeat of Clay. One of Mr.&#xD;
Clay's predictions has been verified. The&#xD;
annexation of Texas involved us in a war&#xD;
with Mexico. But the result of that con-&#xD;
flict was the acquisition of California, as&#xD;
well as the annexation of a State, which,&#xD;
in time, might have become a formidable&#xD;
rival.&#xD;
Whatever causes may have operated to&#xD;
render the annexation movement less ef-&#xD;
fective than it proved in 1844, it is not to&#xD;
be disguised that the Americans possess&#xD;
the same desire for the acquisition of ter-&#xD;
ritory which distinguished their Norman&#xD;
ancestors. We mean Norman, not Saxon.&#xD;
Notwithstanding the constant and nauseous&#xD;
allusion to the Anglo-Saxons, they were&#xD;
always kicked and cuffed, overrun and&#xD;
subjugated, by every nation that took the&#xD;
trouble to invade England. The Angles,&#xD;
Danes, and Normans, to say nothing of the&#xD;
Scots and Picts, regarded those famous&#xD;
Saxons as fit subjects for an iron yoke, and&#xD;
menial offices. We have no cause to be&#xD;
proud of our Anglo-Saxon ancestry, al-&#xD;
though we certainly hear our public men&#xD;
lauding the Anglo-Saxon race, when one-&#xD;
half of them do not know the reason why&#xD;
the two words are mated. They had&#xD;
neither the spirit nor the power to resist&#xD;
invasion, and the only way the fair sex&#xD;
could regain in the bower what their war-&#xD;
riors could not defend in the field, was&#xD;
through the irresistible power of love and&#xD;
wedlock.&#xD;
We have reason to be proud of our Nor-&#xD;
man-ancestry-that splendid and unrivalled&#xD;
race of men-who could retain the con-&#xD;
&#xD;
quests which they had won; although their&#xD;
blood has been some~vhat diluted by inter-&#xD;
marriage with the Britons, Scots, Picts, Sax-&#xD;
ons, Angles, and Danes.&#xD;
The cry for more land is not confined&#xD;
to one section, although it is mainly to&#xD;
one party. The opportunity for the ex-&#xD;
tension of our boundaries has hitherto been&#xD;
almost entirely confined to our south-&#xD;
ern frontier. But when a small slice can&#xD;
be obtained from Canada, as in the settle-&#xD;
ment of the northeastern boundary, we&#xD;
find 'even Mr. Webster can quietly pocket&#xD;
it, with as much modest gravity as Yankee&#xD;
Hill ever exhibited when receiving a more&#xD;
than ordinarily large piece of pumpkin-&#xD;
pie. The satisfaction with which he nabs&#xD;
the tempting "one mile ~vide" is indi-&#xD;
cated by slowly sliding the tongue along&#xD;
the lips from right to left, while the head&#xD;
is slightly inclined, and a scarcely percep-&#xD;
tible, though prolonged "~hem !" is heard,&#xD;
savouring more of religious cant than po-&#xD;
litical gratification.&#xD;
"And so you commence the campaign&#xD;
to-morrow, Clifton? Will Grayson meet&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
"I presume so; we have published a&#xD;
joint list of appointments."&#xD;
"There is to be a barbecue I under-&#xD;
stand?"&#xD;
"Yes; will you accompany me&#xD;
"How far is it?"&#xD;
"At Dryden's store, about fifteen miles&#xD;
distant."&#xD;
"Why, that is in a ~vhig neighbourhood.&#xD;
Rather an inauspicious place to start the&#xD;
ball."&#xD;
"Not at all. I wish to convert the&#xD;
whigs; the democrats are right already."&#xD;
"You have a formidable task to con-&#xD;
t&amp;amp;nd, single-handed, against a host of whig&#xD;
lawyers."&#xD;
" But I shall not struggle alone."&#xD;
"How so? I am not aware that you&#xD;
will have any assistance, unless I desert&#xD;
my patients, and Harden will shake ofi' his&#xD;
lethargy, or rather laziness."&#xD;
"You are mistaken. A few weeks ago&#xD;
I heard the whigs were making taunting&#xD;
allusions to the superior activity of their&#xD;
candidate, and to the place of my birth.&#xD;
They shall pay dearly for both, before the&#xD;
canvass closes."&#xD;
"What is your plan of the campaign ?"&#xD;
"Associations - are formed in each&#xD;
county in the congressional ttistrict; the&#xD;
members of which are pledged, in wri-&#xD;
ting, to address the people twice in a&#xD;
month. No one is to be apprised of the&#xD;
plan, and I shall accomplish two objects.&#xD;

extraordinary degree of enthusiasm in the&#xD;
democratic ranks when private citizeiis&#xD;
mount the stump; and in the second&#xD;
place, as they are not aspirants for office,&#xD;
their opinions will appear more disinte-&#xD;
rested, and will consequently have greater&#xD;
weight."&#xD;
"A capital idea! And how many sub-&#xD;
electors have you initiated V'&#xD;
"Sixty intelligent and influential farm-&#xD;
ers and mechanics will make speeches&#xD;
next Saturday. There is no visible con-&#xD;
ne~don between them and myself and to&#xD;
our opponents the movement will appear&#xD;
like the voluntary action of these disinte-&#xD;
rested patriots."&#xD;
"Why, the whigs will be utterly con-&#xD;
founded !"&#xD;
"I intend they shall be so. I did not&#xD;
undertake the canvass for nothing. If you&#xD;
accompany me to Dryden~s, be ready by&#xD;
eight o'clock= I must be upon the ground&#xD;
at eleven."&#xD;
"Have you adopted rules for the discus-&#xD;
W&#xD;
"Of course. He speak~ an hour. I&#xD;
reply for the same length of time. He&#xD;
rejoins for thirty minutes, and I close the&#xD;
debate in twenty."&#xD;
"And is that the programme for the&#xD;
canvass&#xD;
"No; I open the debate every other&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"That's it, is it? Have you not been&#xD;
astonished that more personal rencotitres&#xD;
do not occur, where two champions ad-&#xD;
dress the same crowd ?"&#xD;
"Titere is always danger where your&#xD;
opponent is not a lawyer. They are accus-&#xD;
tomed to the gladiatoral arena, and al-&#xD;
though greater control over the passions&#xD;
is required in political than legal debates,&#xD;
still propriety and good sense will ever&#xD;
mark the conduct of gentlemen."&#xD;
"But suppose you differ as to facts ?"&#xD;
"In that case, the proof must be forth-&#xD;
coming. That, however, is rarely the&#xD;
case. The history of political parties is&#xD;
thoroughly understood by all candidates.&#xD;
Principles are accurately defined, and the&#xD;
propriety of their application is the essence&#xD;
of political debates."&#xD;
"And you apprehend no difficulty with&#xD;
Grayson ?"&#xD;
"Not the slightest; he is a high-toned&#xD;
gentleman, who would scorn an equivoca-&#xD;
tion, or subterfuge. If I meet Major Hen-&#xD;
derson on the stump, it is not unlikely a&#xD;
collision may occur. I regard him as the&#xD;
most unscrupulous demagogue I have&#xD;
ever seen."&#xD;
&#xD;
"He is the whig candidate for the state&#xD;
at large, is he not?"&#xD;
"Yes; and the most accomplished ora-&#xD;
tor upon their ticket. In private circles he&#xD;
is a gentleman whose colloquial powers&#xD;
and fascination of manner I have never&#xD;
seen equalled; yet in political discussions&#xD;
lie does not hesitate to employ every arti-&#xD;
fice calculated to win votes from the Demo-&#xD;
cratic party."&#xD;
"Clifton, suppose we call upon Helen&#xD;
Douglass? I saw Mrs. Foster wending&#xD;
her way to the manor a few minutes&#xD;
ago."&#xD;
" I have so much to do, before starting&#xD;
to-morrow."&#xD;
"But you have not seen either of them&#xD;
since our return from the Cave."&#xD;
they were seated in the Judge's par-&#xD;
lo~ir.&#xD;
"You have been a sad truant, Mr. Clif-&#xD;
ton, since our return from the fairy regions.&#xD;
So far as you are concerned, we might as&#xD;
well inhabit those subterranean apart-&#xD;
ments, ad infinitum.~~&#xD;
"I have been preparing to start upon a&#xD;
mission for the conversion of unbelieving&#xD;
whigs."&#xD;
"And like all such charitable persona-&#xD;
ges, you leave your own neighbours to take&#xD;
care of themselves, while you are engaged&#xD;
in the philanthropic attempt ~o enlighten&#xD;
others. Well, that is characteristic."&#xD;
Dr. Fielding was passionately fond of&#xD;
music, and conducting Helen to the piano;&#xD;
he seemed enchanted by her exquisite&#xD;
voice. Mrs. Foster and Edward were&#xD;
seated ppon the sofa in the corner of the&#xD;
room. The evening was warm, and she&#xD;
wore a dress cut low in the neck, with&#xD;
short sleeves. The bnlm~ air gently agi-&#xD;
tated the vines which covered the trellis~&#xD;
work, and, laden with perfume, kissed&#xD;
the cheek of the lovely woman. She was&#xD;
knitting a purse. Their conversation was&#xD;
low, for they did not wish to impair the&#xD;
effect of Helen's song. At length they&#xD;
were silent; but her taper fingers still&#xD;
wove together the silken thread.&#xD;
The spell was broken as the last note&#xD;
ceased its vibration, and Helen rose from&#xD;
the piano.&#xD;
There were perhaps five hundred voters&#xD;
assembled at Dryden's store. A stand&#xD;
had been erected in a grove hard by, and&#xD;
thither the candidates proceeded. As&#xD;
they were personal friends, they walked&#xD;
wi~th arms locked, carrying saddle-bags&#xD;
packed with documents. Horses were&#xD;
tied to the swinging limbs several rods&#xD;
from the stand. The spectators were con-&#xD;
versing in knots, or, seated upon the&#xD;
&#xD;
benches, were quietly awaiting the arrival&#xD;
of the speakers. The subject of conver-&#xD;
sation was almost invariably political.&#xD;
All eyes were directed to the youthful&#xD;
champions as they entered the crowd.&#xD;
"Young, are they not ?" said a venera-&#xD;
ble old man to his juvenile companion.&#xD;
" Yes, but none the worse for that,&#xD;
grandsire. I can take my chance the&#xD;
sooner."&#xD;
"What! you don't want to become a&#xD;
politician, do you?"&#xD;
"I should like to when I get well&#xD;
enough informed, which I hope will be&#xD;
the case before I am as old as they are."&#xD;
"Egad, youngster, you are becoming&#xD;
ambitious. Pray, which side shall you&#xD;
espouse ?"&#xD;
CC I am a confirmed whig already.~~&#xD;
"Indeed, and for what cause ?" said&#xD;
the old man, who had served under Jack-&#xD;
son in Florida, and was a thorough demo-&#xD;
crat~ perhaps for that reason.&#xD;
"because I like the whigs the best.&#xD;
They take more notice of their public&#xD;
men. Look at the t~vo conventions which&#xD;
assembled at the capital during the last&#xD;
presidential canvass. The whig candi-&#xD;
dates for electors were paraded through the&#xD;
streets in carriages, to the envy of half the&#xD;
town. Do you think there were a dozen&#xD;
young men who did not resolve to be-&#xD;
come whig candidates for electors at some&#xD;
future day. What a contrast did the de-&#xD;
mocracy present. Their candidates were&#xD;
groping through the city, seeking the most&#xD;
indifferent accommodations, without being&#xD;
elevated an inch above the common herd.&#xD;
Nothing was done to reward them for&#xD;
the past, or to stimulate them for the&#xD;
future. Bah! who would be a democrat ?"&#xD;
"Why, you young renegade! But I&#xD;
will lecture you another time; Mr. Gray-&#xD;
son is speaking."&#xD;
The whig champion grasped the subject&#xD;
with boldness and ability. He took deci-&#xD;
sive ground against the immediate annex-&#xD;
ation of Texas, as calculated to impair&#xD;
the honourof the United Statesand involve&#xD;
the country in a war with Mexico. This&#xD;
at once raised the question of Texan inde-&#xD;
pendence, and opened the whole doctrine&#xD;
of the right of revolution. He advocated&#xD;
a tariff, discriminating for protection in-&#xD;
stead of revenue, a restriction of the veto&#xD;
power, and the distribution of the pro-&#xD;
ceeds of the sales of the public lands.&#xD;
These were the issues which Messrs.&#xD;
Clay and Polk had made up for the can-&#xD;
vass, and they were defined and elabo-&#xD;
rated with great ability by the impas-&#xD;
sioned orator. He was much applauded&#xD;
&#xD;
during his speech, and when he descend-&#xD;
ed from the stand he was warmly con-&#xD;
gratulated by his friends.&#xD;
Edward knew that the weak point in&#xD;
his opponent's speech was the Texas&#xD;
question; and without committing the&#xD;
dangerous fault of evading any issue that&#xD;
had been presented, he nevertheless ex-&#xD;
erted all his powers to demolish the anti-&#xD;
Texan argument of his opponent. The&#xD;
sympathies of the audience were with&#xD;
him, and they were alone prevented by&#xD;
the force of party drill from joining the&#xD;
democratic ranks en masse.&#xD;
Clifton rapidly reviewed the history of&#xD;
Texas; its acquisition in 1803, its retroces-&#xD;
cession in 1819, and the final struggle for&#xD;
independence in 1836. He argued that&#xD;
nothing could be clearer than the right of&#xD;
Texas to dispose of herself. The only&#xD;
remaining question was the propriety of&#xD;
admitting the territory to the sisterhood of&#xD;
States. He assumed that there was no&#xD;
doctrine more positively endorsed by the&#xD;
American people than that contiguous ter-&#xD;
ritory should be acquired whenever we&#xD;
have the opportunity. "There are over-&#xD;
whelming arguments in favour of the&#xD;
policy," he declared. "it is always well&#xD;
to rid ourselves of troublesome neP~hbours,&#xD;
and thus avoid vexatious disputes in set-&#xD;
tling boundary lines. We convert rivals&#xD;
into friends and allies; nay more, we&#xD;
make them a part of ourselves. We&#xD;
sweep away those conventional forms&#xD;
and absurd jealousies which have caused&#xD;
rivers of blood to water the fields of&#xD;
Europe. We obtain land for the millions&#xD;
who will cultivate it before the expira-&#xD;
tion of this century. Each citizen will feel&#xD;
a double interest in the onward strides of&#xD;
the republic, because he owns a portion&#xD;
of the soil, and by our gigantic strength,&#xD;
we shall command that respect which is&#xD;
rarely accorded to poverty and imbecility&#xD;
by the conventional etiquette of either&#xD;
nations or individuals. It is sometimes&#xD;
said our career may terminate like that of&#xD;
the Romans. Suppose it does; would&#xD;
not the pride of the most ambitious be&#xD;
satisfied, if the United States could for&#xD;
centuries occupy a position of such unex-&#xD;
ampled splendour in the West as thatwhich&#xD;
the 'City of the Seven Hills' maintained&#xD;
in the East. The science, refinement, and&#xD;
military renown of that celebrated power&#xD;
will occupy a larger space in the memory&#xD;
of posterity than any other nation. The&#xD;
triumph of the English arms under Marl-&#xD;
borough, Wellington, and Nelson is marred&#xD;
by the successive conquests of the island&#xD;
by the Romans, Saxons, Danes, and Nor-&#xD;

ancient capital when she could no longer&#xD;
defend it, and she now watches in vain,&#xD;
notwithstanding her colossal power, for&#xD;
an opportunity to seize Constantinople.&#xD;
"How immeasurably does the long and&#xD;
brilliant career of the Romans overshadow&#xD;
that of any other European nation. It&#xD;
stands out upon the pages of history alone&#xD;
and unapproachable. For centuries they&#xD;
held the destinies of the world in their&#xD;
grasp. My opponent says our thirst&#xD;
for land will make our destiny run parallel&#xD;
with that of the Romans! For one I will&#xD;
give him the full benefit of the a~sump-&#xD;
tion. Nations, like individuals, are affect-&#xD;
ed by the operations of time, and if from&#xD;
the womb of futurity, events of such mag-&#xD;
nitude are to be revealed, as were traced&#xD;
upon the pages of Roman history, let the&#xD;
startling consummation be compiled in the&#xD;
annals of An~erica. I wish a destiny no&#xD;
more grand for the American States than&#xD;
is recorded by the Roman historian. But&#xD;
while I make this admission, I nra not dis-&#xD;
posed to let him create the impression&#xD;
that the cases are at all parallel. They&#xD;
are widely dissimilar. The Romans ex-&#xD;
tended their conquests by the sword. They&#xD;
maintained them by the same coercive&#xD;
authority, and whenever their military&#xD;
surveillance was withdrawii, the conquered&#xD;
provinces revolted. It was a misfortune,&#xD;
too, that the seat of their power was a&#xD;
single city, into which the boundless&#xD;
wealth of the empire was poured, butAo&#xD;
corrupt the public heart, and enervate&#xD;
those soldiers who had caused the re-&#xD;
motest nation to tremble at the mention of&#xD;
the Roman name. Here, we seek not the&#xD;
acquisition of Texas by conquest. They&#xD;
are Our friends, who do no wish to be&#xD;
converted into enemies. They desire a&#xD;
more perfect union with their fatherland.&#xD;
It will not require mercenary soldiers to&#xD;
hold them in subjection; on the contrary,&#xD;
if ~a war ensues, they will be the first to&#xD;
rally beneath the stars and stripes. I am&#xD;
confounded at the absolute folly which&#xD;
prompts a refusal of their application. The&#xD;
history of the human race does not afford&#xD;
&#xD;
another instance of such stupid political&#xD;
madness, as that which marks the policy&#xD;
of the Whig party. At the behest of a&#xD;
distinguished statesman, they array them-&#xD;
selves against a struggling people, who&#xD;
have staked their lives in defence of their&#xD;
altars and their homes, and they expect&#xD;
you-ay, you! individually and collec-&#xD;
tively, to obey the order, left face."&#xD;
Many of you have relations who fell in&#xD;
the Texan revolution. Gan you reject&#xD;
their appeals, and force them to become&#xD;
aliens from the land of their nativity?&#xD;
Will you become the laughing-stock of&#xD;
the civilized world, by refusing a bloodless&#xD;
extension of "the area of freedom," when&#xD;
England. France, and Russia, are yearly&#xD;
re-marking their boundaries with blood ?"&#xD;
"No, no! iiever !" shouted the excited&#xD;
crowd, who were carried away by the en-&#xD;
thusiasm of the speaker.&#xD;
You have made a good impression,77&#xD;
whispered Fielding, as they advanced to&#xD;
the spot where the barbecued meats were&#xD;
placed upon the tables.&#xD;
The process is simple by which the food&#xD;
is prepared. Trenches are dug in the&#xD;
earth, into which wood is thrown and&#xD;
burned to coals. Round sticks are laid&#xD;
across the trench, and the carcasses of beef,&#xD;
pork, or lamb, are placed upon them.&#xD;
During the process of cooking, they are&#xD;
sprinkled plentifully with salt vinegar, and&#xD;
pepper. They are then laid upon rude&#xD;
tables, erected for the occasion, and lhe&#xD;
spectators are invited to help themselves.&#xD;
The method of "helpincr one's self" is&#xD;
quite as primitive as the preparation of the&#xD;
fare. The utensils which are brought into&#xD;
requisition, present no kind of uniformity.&#xD;
Each man draws forth his pocket-knife,&#xD;
and in the aggregate, they vary in size&#xD;
from a slender blade to an Arkansas tooth-&#xD;
pick. Some of them bear unmistakable&#xD;
evidence of having been used in cutting&#xD;
tobacco, while others are stained with&#xD;
apple-juice. With these weapons each&#xD;
man carves for himself aiid when the&#xD;
meal has been postponed, to accommo-&#xD;
date long-winded speakers, and the crowd&#xD;
have become hungry and impatient, the&#xD;
spectacle in the vicinity of the eatables is&#xD;
quite as uncouth and disorderly as that&#xD;
which often disgraces the unmannered, at&#xD;
a fashionable supper-table.&#xD;
"I can tell you one thing, Mac,-Clifton&#xD;
proved too much for your man to-day."&#xD;
"Nonsense! Colonel, how you are go-&#xD;
verned by prejudice."&#xD;
"Not a bit of it; it is a fact, and no mis-&#xD;
take, and I can prove. it. The whigs&#xD;
looked exfluctified, when our candidate&#xD;
&#xD;
was pouring in them licks on the Texas&#xD;
question."&#xD;
"You imagined such was the case. I&#xD;
must confess, though, that the lads are very&#xD;
well matched."&#xD;
"That's anuff-whenever an opponent&#xD;
admits that his man is riot superior to&#xD;
ourn, the game's up. Come, now, con-&#xD;
fess, Mac: ain't it darned hard for a man&#xD;
to be forced to change his opinion, just be-&#xD;
cause Harry of the West says he must ~"&#xD;
"I have great confidence in Harry,&#xD;
Colonel. He may be right, arter all"&#xD;
"But didn't you make a speech, Mac,&#xD;
not four months ago, in which you pledged&#xD;
yourself, under all circumstances, to vote&#xD;
for Texas '~ Ain't agoin' to craw-fish, are&#xD;
ye ~"&#xD;
Well, hasn't a man a right to change&#xD;
his opiniorti"&#xD;
"Yes. but it looks suspicious on such a&#xD;
short notice."&#xD;
"Come, Mac, that's hardly fair. Recol-&#xD;
lect, your party ain't always consistent.&#xD;
Didn't Mr. Grayson say that in Pennsyl-&#xD;
vania the democrats have inscribed upon&#xD;
their banners, 'Polk, Dallas, and the&#xD;
Tariff of 1842,' and ain't you all opposed&#xD;
to the tariff of 1842 in this State1 If in-&#xD;
consistency is so bad in me, how does it&#xD;
appear in you V~&#xD;
"That's a fact. But the great question&#xD;

"Recollect, delay may throw that ccmun-&#xD;

blood of your kinsman."&#xD;
"I'll think of it, Mr. Clifton," said the&#xD;
honest farmer, as a tear gathered in his eye.&#xD;
For the purpose of awakening the en-&#xD;
thusiasm of his party, Edward projected a&#xD;
convention at Duncanville, at which the&#xD;
different States and Territories were to&#xD;
be represented by young and beautiful&#xD;
women. Public curiosity was awakened,&#xD;
and thousands congregated to witness the&#xD;
spectacle. The streets were lined with&#xD;
carriages, and every window was filled&#xD;
that commanded a view of the procession.&#xD;
At eleven o'clock, the distaiit roll of a&#xD;
drum was heard, accompanieti by dis-&#xD;
charges of artillery. As waving flags were&#xD;
seen approaching the court-house, the in-&#xD;
spiriting notes of martial music floated&#xD;
&#xD;
upon the air. The head of the column&#xD;
advaticed, and thirty ladies, clothed in&#xD;
black riding dresses, with velvet hats and&#xD;
white plumes, and mounted upon white&#xD;
horses, slowly passed through the avenue&#xD;
of human beings. Each lady was escorted&#xD;
by a gallant, mounted upon a black horse.&#xD;
Their progress was indicated by. waving&#xD;
handkerchiefs and loud huzzas, and when&#xD;
they assembled around the court-house&#xD;
steps, hemmed in by the vast throng, the&#xD;
enthusiasm was boundless, and cheer&#xD;
upon cheer rent the heavens, while the&#xD;
continuous boQining of cannon added to&#xD;
the grandeur of the scene. Mrs. Foster,&#xD;
Helen Douglass, and Emy Davidson, were&#xD;
among the splendidarray.&#xD;

BYRoN.&#xD;
MRS. FOSTER was sitting at the parlour&#xD;
window, pensively watching the departure&#xD;
of twilight; that hour into whose fleeting&#xD;
moments are crowded so many sad and&#xD;
regretful thoughts. The servant lighted&#xD;
the carcel lamp, but turned the wheels so&#xD;
that it cast a soft and mellow light through&#xD;
the apartment. He then retired without&#xD;
disturbing the meditations of his mistress.&#xD;
Mrs. Foster, like many other ambitious&#xD;
girls, had sacrificed herself for the attain-&#xD;
ment of wealth, and when too late, found&#xD;
that gold could not fill the void in her&#xD;
affections. There was a ceaseless yearn-&#xD;
ing for some object upon whom her love&#xD;
could be bestowed. Her fate was like that&#xD;
of thousands who have vainly sought to&#xD;
gratify an ambition for display, by attempt-&#xD;
ing to stifle the unappeasable cravings of&#xD;
the heart. Her feelings had acquired a&#xD;
bitterness, which caused her to level her&#xD;
cruel sarcasms at her unoffending step-&#xD;
daughter. And yet she was gifted byna-&#xD;
ture with Warm and generous impulses.&#xD;
She was not an exception to the rule, how-&#xD;
ever,, that a sacrifice of the mind's purest&#xD;
emotions, for whatever cause, will surely&#xD;
be followed by the remorseless importu-&#xD;
nity of love, until the sensibilities are de-&#xD;

She started as Mr. Clifton was an-&#xD;
nounced, and a blush suffused her cheek.&#xD;
She advanced to meet him with a pleased&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"I am glad you have called, for I was&#xD;
so lonely."&#xD;
"Can it be possible that you are ever&#xD;
And why not? The chalice which is&#xD;
held to the lips of the most gifted, is often&#xD;
poisoned."&#xD;
"I have observed it. C~an you explain&#xD;
the cause&#xD;
"We are too rarely satisfied with our&#xD;
condition, and are oftener inclined to com-&#xD;
plain that fate has not been more propi-&#xD;
tious, tIAn to be thankful because it has&#xD;
not been more unkind."&#xD;
"Tue universal discontent, should there-&#xD;
fore be attributed to a malformation of the&#xD;
intellectual powers, rather than to the for-&#xD;
tune whi~h destiny confers."&#xD;
"Do you think so, Mr. Clifton ?" ~&#xD;
"Unquestionably. If only a small seg-&#xD;
ment of the human family refined at the&#xD;
decrees of an invincible necessity, then it&#xD;
might be attributed to our own selfishness.&#xD;
But the malady is universal and over-&#xD;
whelming, and saps the foundation of all&#xD;
our joys. Discontent caused the banish-&#xD;
ment of Adam and Eve from Paradise,&#xD;
and it is the mightiest curse which was&#xD;
invoked upon their descendants."&#xD;
"Greater than revenire&#xD;

dishonored, and pecuniary embarrass-&#xD;

It is almost the only cause of domestic&#xD;

always endeavouring~to open them, arid&#xD;

is unhappy if her party is not as good as&#xD;

"Donh misunderstand me! Although&#xD;
we are presented by our pursuits, from&#xD;
making ourselves miserable ab out sue/s&#xD;

in keeping .for the sterner sex. What is&#xD;
it that causes the cheek of the student to&#xD;
pale over the midnight lamp? Why does&#xD;
the soldier recklessly meet the iron hail,&#xD;
and bristling bayonet? To what end does&#xD;
the adventurous merchant trust his all to&#xD;

It is because discontent has assumed abso-&#xD;

"But are not inconsiderate marriages&#xD;
the source of as much wretchedness ?"&#xD;
"The anguish caused by uncongenial&#xD;
alliances is doubtless more intense. But&#xD;
ill-starred we(ldings are not universal. A&#xD;
similarity of taste may produce, what is&#xD;
sometimes termed the full fruition of con-&#xD;
nubial bliss, where t~iere is nothing to&#xD;
alienate those who have ohee loved."&#xD;
"Shall I infer from your language, that&#xD;
the bonds of love are dissoluble ?'~&#xD;
"Can you doubt it! A gentleman,&#xD;
gifted with all the impetuosity and ro-&#xD;
mance o~youth, is introduced to a lady, in&#xD;
whose veins courses blood as warm and&#xD;
passionate as his own. Each seeks to&#xD;

~both have made. He enters her presence&#xD;
with glossy hair, polished boots, and a&#xD;
closely shaved chin. Sl~ of course does&#xD;

faultless, even to the well-laced boot; and&#xD;

not fall to the carpet, as she occupies the&#xD;
sofa, there is nothing rei~ealed but spotless&#xD;
linen. They are married. Before two&#xD;
years have elapsed, he prefers the club,&#xD;
or the lodge, to her society. Instead[ of&#xD;
trying to win him back, by the matchless&#xD;
power of love, she upbraids and reproaches&#xD;
him, until the company of his associates&#xD;
becomes more attractive than her own. If&#xD;
he is naturally domestic, a disordered&#xD;
household, and a slovenly wife, will soon&#xD;
alienate him from his dwelling, and ban-&#xD;
ish the husband and father from those who&#xD;
should claim his respect, as well as his&#xD;
affection."&#xD;

"Is there no such sentiment, then, as&#xD;

"With but one exception, no. There&#xD;
are a thousand causes which will sunder&#xD;
the marriage tie, alienate friends, or pro-&#xD;

honour or crime, it steadily clings to the&#xD;
object of its adoration, and unfalteringly&#xD;
pursues its footsteps from the cradle to the&#xD;
tomb."&#xD;
"What an unbeliever thou art! But&#xD;

"Circumstances will undoubtedly pro&#xD;

said Edward earnestly, as he took herhand.&#xD;
"She is a sweet, gentle girl, whose very&#xD;
existence you are daily torturing. Will&#xD;
you destroy the just hopes of happiness,&#xD;
which a person placed under your protec-&#xD;
tion, has a right to claim? Remember,&#xD;
tbat it is happiness, which we all seek, in&#xD;
this brief existence. I know you will be&#xD;
more gentle. Stubborn cruelty is un-&#xD;
natural; especially in the bosom of one,&#xD;
who is formed for the dominion of hve."&#xD;
Her pulse beat more quickly, under&#xD;
the soft pressure of his hand, as he warm-&#xD;
ly urged his request. Her eye became&#xD;
liquid, the whole frame thrilled with&#xD;
emotion, as if each muscle was gifted&#xD;
with a new life. Her beautiful limbs be-&#xD;
came powerless, and every nerve thrilled&#xD;
with ecstatic life; the respiration was&#xD;
quick and fluttering, the eyelids were&#xD;
half closed, the countenance was- pale,&#xD;
save where the cheeks were illuminated by&#xD;
the hot blood. Under the influence of a&#xD;
strange and irresistible fatality, her head&#xD;
fell upon his shoulder, and her sweet&#xD;
breath played upon his forehead. Ed-&#xD;
ward was at first appalled; but as the&#xD;
lovely burden rested in his arms, it was&#xD;
more than mortal power could resist.&#xD;
While her rosy lips were imparting their&#xD;
sweetness, the parlour door was opened,&#xD;
and Ellen Foster stood before them.&#xD;
She gazed for a moment, transfixed to&#xD;
the spot, and then turning away, she&#xD;
sighed, "At least my bondage is ended.&#xD;
I am a slave no longer. So at last does&#xD;
retributive justice overtake the bad."&#xD;

THE Presidential election was approach-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing. Edward had labored with exttaor-&#xD;
dinary energy, through the changeable&#xD;
weather of spring, and now the cool and'&#xD;
bracing air of autumn served to rein-&#xD;
vigorate a frame, which had endured the&#xD;
scorching heat of a summer's sun. There&#xD;
wa~ no abatement of the enthusiasm;&#xD;
conventions had succeeded mass meet-&#xD;
ings, processions and barbecues followed&#xD;
each other with amazing rapidity, and&#xD;
the whole population of the State seemed&#xD;
to be in motion. Counties were traversed,&#xD;
and each day, large crowds were address-&#xD;
ed by popular orators. The passions,&#xD;
as well as the prejudices of the populace,&#xD;
were aroused, and. heavy bets were made&#xD;
in violation of the statute. The history of&#xD;
l)ohltical conflicts furnishes no parallel to&#xD;
the intense excitement which pervaded&#xD;
the ranks of the rival parties. But there&#xD;
were moments of relaxation. The coun-&#xD;
try abounded with game, the streams con-&#xD;
tained myriads of fish, and hunting and&#xD;
piscatorial excursions were often formed.&#xD;
On a bright morning in the month&#xD;
of October, Grayson, Edward, and a&#xD;
party of a dozen friends, accompanied&#xD;
by several ladies, including Ellen Foster,&#xD;
Helen Douglass, and Emy Davidson,, start-&#xD;
ed for the barrens, about ten miles to the&#xD;
west of Stamford. This was a portion of&#xD;
country thinly covered by a stunted&#xD;
growth of trees.. The ground was undu-&#xD;
lating, except where it bordered upon the&#xD;
creek; it there became rough, in some&#xD;
places precipitous. A lofty hill over-&#xD;
looked the chase, and upon this, the ladies&#xD;
stationed themselves. The openings in&#xD;
the forest enabled the spectator to com-&#xD;
mand a view of the surrounding country,&#xD;
as far as the sight could extend. To the&#xD;
south, the barrens spread out for several&#xD;
miles, and terminated in a dense wood.&#xD;
The surface of the earth in that direction&#xD;
was rolling, and a successioii of gentle ac-&#xD;
clivities and grassy valleys, like the waves&#xD;
of the. ocean, approached to within one&#xD;
mile of the mount. At that point, instead&#xD;
of continuing to groove the barrens&#xD;
transversely, the ridges and glens curved,&#xD;
until the outlines of each were traceable&#xD;
from the position which the ladies occu-&#xD;
pied. The base of the elevation was&#xD;
wateredd by the creek, which flowed from&#xD;
east to west. The stream was scarcely&#xD;
more than twenty yards wide, but it was&#xD;
sluggish and, deep. The ground sloped to&#xD;
the water's edge upon both sides; in some&#xD;
places, however, it was so marshy that it&#xD;
would neither support the weight of horse&#xD;
or deer. Beyond the creek was a level&#xD;
waste, almost entirely destitute of timber,&#xD;

thy muscles, gentle deer, for death is on&#xD;
thy footsteps !"&#xD;
"Your champion has the start, Ellen,"&#xD;
exclaimed Harden; "but where can the&#xD;
others be ?"&#xD;
"There comes the black horse in the&#xD;
other's track, and emerging from the bushes&#xD;
to the right is another. It's the bay.&#xD;
Good heavens! how madly he rides," and&#xD;
the girl's voice ~trembled. "Along the&#xD;
ridge, from the left, dashes the white&#xD;
charger. They are all in view. The start&#xD;
is beautifQl! See, they disappear together&#xD;
in yonder valley."&#xD;
"You forget; they are too far away to&#xD;
be seen with the naked eye. But where&#xD;
is the buck ~"&#xD;
For a moment she examined the sdene&#xD;
in silence. "Ah! there he is, doubling&#xD;
to the right, as if he would deceive his&#xD;
pursuers. Foolish thing! there are eager&#xD;
eyes upon your bounding form, as well as&#xD;
unerring scent upon your footsteps. A&#xD;
direct, undeviating flight is your only hope.&#xD;
While he is making the curve of yonder&#xD;
elevation they are approaching us in a&#xD;
body."&#xD;
"The pack opens. Hear you not the&#xD;
houndsV' cried Harden.&#xD;
"Yes, and see them, too. Their forms&#xD;
are scarcely perceptible, still they rapidly&#xD;
follow in the path of the game."&#xD;
"What music in their voices !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Harden, enthusiastically. "No-&#xD;
thing could be more delicious !" and he&#xD;
gazed with intense excitement upon the&#xD;
horsemen, who were just coming into view.&#xD;
"Now the chase seems to fly. But&#xD;
good heavens! What is that bounding&#xD;
along, with head erect, regardless of the&#xD;
&#xD;
trail ~ It gains upon him, too, notwith-&#xD;
standing the velocity of his motion. 'Tis&#xD;
* the greyhound! Poor victim! I fear there&#xD;
is no hope for you. Here, take the glass;&#xD;
I can look no longer."&#xD;
They were all now in open view.&#xD;
Thrice the buck had doubled, but his at-&#xD;
tempts to elude pursuit only had the effect&#xD;
of prolonging the scene in that part of the&#xD;
field. Whenever he disappeared behind&#xD;
a hill and changed his course in the val-&#xD;
ley, the greyhound lost the direction, and&#xD;
was thrown off. But the moment he as-&#xD;
cended another elevation, the relentless foe&#xD;
was in swift pursuit. The bloodhounds,&#xD;
on the contrary, followed the trail ~vith un-&#xD;
deviating steps, through aAl its findings.&#xD;
With heads bent to the earth, and tongues&#xD;
protruding from their mouths the opening&#xD;
pack heliT on their way. Tue horsemen&#xD;
had kept nearly in a body for three miles.&#xD;
The white horse and the bay were a little&#xD;
in advance, but not enough to indicate a&#xD;
fintd triumph. As they approached the&#xD;
spot where the hills and valleys curved in&#xD;
the direction of the mount, they spread&#xD;
out, so as to prevent ih'~deer from turning&#xD;
upon his footsteps. Thus balked, he&#xD;
headed directly for the creek, and towards&#xD;
the hill from whence the spectators were&#xD;
watching his flight.&#xD;
Davidson and Edward kept the summit&#xD;
of two ridges, while Grayson an(l Fielding&#xD;
traced the line of separate valleys. The&#xD;
rest of the huntsmen were scattered over&#xD;
the field, and were all some distancee in&#xD;
the rear of the others. About one hundred&#xD;
rods from the mount a narrow dell crossed&#xD;
the course. The descent was abrupt, ex-&#xD;
cept at the spot where Grayson was ap-&#xD;
proaching it. But there the passage was&#xD;
rendered difficult by a mass of grape-vines.&#xD;
Davidson and Fielding were familiar with&#xD;
that part of the ground, and they had bare-&#xD;
ly time to raise a warning shout to their&#xD;
companions, when they were upon the&#xD;
verge of the glen. There was no time&#xD;
for hesitation or delay; and Edward, daslf-&#xD;
ing his spurs into the flanks of his. horse,&#xD;
urged him to leap the gulf. The feat was&#xD;
a hazardous one. For three miles his&#xD;
horse had followed the dogs at the top of&#xD;
his speed, until they were all passed, ex-&#xD;
cept the greyhound and one of the curs.&#xD;
The dell was not less than twenty feet&#xD;
wide, and half-a-dozen in depth. The&#xD;
summit upon each side was firm, how-&#xD;
ever, and with a tremendous bound the&#xD;
blacr horse cleared the chasm. Fielding&#xD;
was not so fortunate. He had overtasked&#xD;
the powers of the mare; for a moment&#xD;
her slender form was seen floating over&#xD;
&#xD;
the abyss, but only her forefeet touched&#xD;
the bank, and she rolled backwards into&#xD;
the gulf.&#xD;
The dapple-gray now approached the&#xD;
glen. Davidson had succeeded in check-&#xD;
ing his speed a few rods from the bank,&#xD;
and he now approached it with his limbs&#xD;
well gathered under him. Although a&#xD;
faster steed than the black, he was not so&#xD;
good a leaper. As the rider touched him&#xD;
with the spur, he bounded forward with&#xD;
an angry snort. The distance ~ was too&#xD;
great, and the hindfeet alighted upon the&#xD;
slope of the bank. For a moment&#xD;
seemed that Davidsontoo, would be hurl-&#xD;
ed backwards, but the horse with a spring&#xD;
regained the level ground, and bounded&#xD;
away.&#xD;
The career of the white charger had not&#xD;
been arrested as he approached the spot&#xD;
which had proved so disastrous to Dr.&#xD;
Fielding. He dashed with headlong&#xD;
speed into a cluster of grape-vines, and&#xD;
Grayson was unhorsed.&#xD;
"Good God ~ exclaimed Harden,&#xD;
"where are Grayson and the Doctor ~ they&#xD;
havq disappeared. Look! look! horse-&#xD;
man after horseman vanish from our view.&#xD;
By heavens! yonder dashes a riderless&#xD;
steed!' See! there too goes tl~,e white&#xD;
horse. But three horsemen can be seen.&#xD;
Stay; is not that Fielding who appears to&#xD;
be rising from the earth ~ The glass! It&#xD;
is; onward he comes, but too late! Da-&#xD;
vidson and Clifton are almost here. How&#xD;
their horses foam! Is it not a glorious&#xD;
sight ~ Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah !"&#xD;
The cheers from the excited Senator&#xD;
caused the deer to swerve so much, that&#xD;
instead of passing to the left of the mount,&#xD;
he turned to the right, and bounded along&#xD;
the valley which intervened between the&#xD;
elevation which Edward and young Da-&#xD;
vidson were traversing. The buck was&#xD;
large and powerful, and still held on with&#xD;
surprising velocity; but it was apparent&#xD;
that his strength could not much longer en-&#xD;
dure the exertion which it was necessary&#xD;
to make, in order to elude the attack of&#xD;
the greyhound. The bounds were still&#xD;
loft, but his motions were not so elastic,&#xD;
an d the tongue which protruded far from&#xD;
his mouth, indicated that his flight would&#xD;
soon terminate. The noble dog gallantly&#xD;
pursued the chase. For the last mile the&#xD;
deer had scarcely diverged from a direct&#xD;
line, and each moment the distance was&#xD;
lessened between the two. When the&#xD;
stag had reached the bank of the creek,&#xD;
the greyhound was not more than three&#xD;
yards behind. The course which Edward&#xD;
and Davidson had taken was more direct&#xD;
&#xD;
than that of the deer, for they knew he&#xD;
would attempt to gain the creek along one&#xD;
of the ridges which led to the pinnacle.&#xD;
They were, therefore, within twenty yards&#xD;
of the chase when he disappeared over&#xD;
the bank of the creek.&#xD;
"How the foam pours from their sides !"&#xD;
exclaimed Harden, "and from their&#xD;
mouths, too; still, they want not the spur.&#xD;
With what eagerness each horse pursues&#xD;
the game! See; the forms of their riders&#xD;
are thrown back, as with tightened reins&#xD;
they endeavour to check their speed."&#xD;
The two huntsmen raised their caps as&#xD;
they swept past the mount.&#xD;
'' For heaven's sake, be careful ~&#xD;
shouted Harden, as the reckless horsemen&#xD;
dashed down the declivity towards the&#xD;
water. "The marsh! the marsh! Clifton."&#xD;
The warning came too late, and the gal-&#xD;
lant black struggled uiavailingly to re-&#xD;
lease himself from the slough. The dap-&#xD;
ple-gray was more fortunate. The ridge&#xD;
which he had followed terminated in a&#xD;
gravelly beach, and the generous steed&#xD;
had plunged into the water before the buck&#xD;
had gained the opposite shore.&#xD;
"Your champion is the victor, Miss&#xD;
Ellen," said the Judge.&#xD;
Perhaps not," exclaimed Emy: "the&#xD;
game is not yet caught !"&#xD;
"Yes, but your knight is hors de com-&#xD;
bat."&#xD;
The stag had reached the shore, and&#xD;
was ascending the acclivity, when the grey-&#xD;
hound seized him with his terrible jaws,&#xD;
and they again floated in the stream. The&#xD;
buck now turned, and struck fiercely at&#xD;
his relentless pursuer. When thoroughly&#xD;
aroused, a stag at bay becomes a formida-&#xD;
ble foe. The hound was one of the most&#xD;
resolute, of his breed, and returning to the&#xD;
attack, they fought with the greatest fury,&#xD;
as they slowly drifted down the current.&#xD;
Twice had the teeth of the assailant been&#xD;
fastened in the throat of the stag, yet each&#xD;
time he was cfashed off, with a violence&#xD;
which caused the blood to pour from his&#xD;
lacerated breast. The stag was now&#xD;
hemmed in with foes. Davidson slowly&#xD;
swam his horse towards the combatants,&#xD;
and a score of blood-hounds were plunging&#xD;
into the stream.&#xD;
"Oh! it is too cruel "exclaimed Helen,&#xD;
as the tears started to Aer eyes; "will you&#xD;
give the gallant stag no chance for his life.&#xD;
'Tis cowardly to encompass him with&#xD;
foes."&#xD;
"He shall have fair play," replied Har-&#xD;
den; and with a voice that soared above&#xD;
the cry of the hounds, he ordered David-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC8086-00000066"/>&#xD;
142&#xD;
&#xD;
C L I F T 0 N.&#xD;
&#xD;
son, in the name of the arbitress, not to&#xD;
mingle in the combat.&#xD;
In the mean time, the greyhound con-&#xD;
tinued to assail the deer with the most&#xD;
savage determination. Both were despe-&#xD;
rately wounded, still they fought* on with&#xD;
unconquerable resolution. The buck no&#xD;
longer attempted to gain the shore, and,&#xD;
regardless of Davidson's presence, he had&#xD;
no eye but for the enemy, whose assaults&#xD;
he met with corresponding ferocity. Once&#xD;
he hurled the dog from him with such&#xD;
violence that he disappeared for several&#xD;
moments, beneath the surface of the&#xD;
water. Instead of trying to escape after&#xD;
this repulse, the enraged animal glanced&#xD;
his blood-shot eyes around, as if awaiting&#xD;
the reappearance of the hound. The&#xD;
exasperated dog came up near the head of&#xD;
the stag, and seizing him by the throat, he&#xD;
clung to ~his victim with a power which&#xD;
resisted every attempt to shake him off.&#xD;
Again and again the body of the hound&#xD;
was stricken with a force which drove it&#xD;
from the water, and disclosed the terrible&#xD;
wounds which were furrowed by the sharp&#xD;
hoofs of e deer; still his teeth remained&#xD;
fixed an movable, as though fastened&#xD;
upon h foe with the power of a screw.&#xD;
The bl of each dyed the water; their&#xD;
struggles became less and less violent,&#xD;
and ceased altogether, as they touched the&#xD;
beach several rods below the pinnacle.&#xD;
Davidson, who had, with great difficulty,&#xD;
beat off the blood-hounds, now approached&#xD;
the combatants. The forms of both were&#xD;
rigid and motionless.&#xD;
Clifton succeeded in extricating his&#xD;
charger from the mire, and reached the&#xD;
mount just as the rest of the party aSsem-&#xD;
bled at its base. One of the hunters had&#xD;
- broken a rib, Grayson had received a con-&#xD;
tusion upon the shoulder, and Fielding's&#xD;
head was bound with a handkerchief for&#xD;
the purpose of stanching the blood, which&#xD;
flowed from a cut in his temple.&#xD;
Davidson, alone, of all the huntsmen,&#xD;
had met with no accident, and he now!&#xD;
approached, bearing the antlers of the stao~&#xD;
upon his saddle-bow.&#xD;
" Gentlemen, to the successful champion&#xD;
is awarded the meed of beauty,~7 observed&#xD;
Judge Douglass; "Ellen, 'tis yours to&#xD;
present."&#xD;
The horseman bent low, as the timid&#xD;
and beautiful maiden adjusted an~ em-&#xD;
broidered scarf over his shoulder, and tied&#xD;
it upon his heart.&#xD;
"It was a right gallant chase," said&#xD;
Harden; "I wished myself in your midst.&#xD;
But what unhorsed so many of you in one&#xD;
spot ~"&#xD;
&#xD;
"It was that treacherous chasm," replied&#xD;
Fielding; "I have always cleared it be-&#xD;
fore. Your horse made the most splendid&#xD;
leap I ha~'e ever beheld, Clifton ;his feet&#xD;
lighted upon the bank a full yard from its&#xD;
edge.~~&#xD;
"I wish he had been as successful in&#xD;
passing the slough."&#xD;
"Oh! that was the fault of neither.&#xD;
The ground has the appearance of being&#xD;
firm. How did you pass the gulf, David-&#xD;
son&#xD;
"Not s~ well as Mr. Clifton. I came&#xD;
near sharing your fate, Doctor. Poor Carlo,&#xD;
I regret your fate! He might have been&#xD;
living, but for your orders, Miss Helen."&#xD;
"So might the stag, Mr. Davidson, but&#xD;
for this day's sport. To my poor judgment,&#xD;
one appeared as worthy of life as the&#xD;
other."&#xD;
"But he was a noble ~&#xD;
"Not more so than the deer. How&#xD;
magnificent his retreat; how gallant his&#xD;
defence."&#xD;
There was a great contrast in the ap-&#xD;
pearance of the horses now and when&#xD;
they started from the mount. They were&#xD;
covere(l with foam, and with drooping&#xD;
heads an(l trembling limbs, the panting&#xD;
steeds were recovering their breath. The&#xD;
bay mare had received a wound upon her&#xD;
shoulder; the breast of Grayson's horse&#xD;
was lacerated, and the blood trickled along&#xD;
the white hairs; the black charger was&#xD;
covered with mud; and from the body of&#xD;
the gray the water still dropped. One&#xD;
horseman had lost his stirrup, another his&#xD;
bridle, while the saddle of a third was&#xD;
turned. The hounds were equally over-&#xD;
come with fatigue; some were cooling&#xD;
themselves in the creek, while others&#xD;
stretched their bodies upon the earth.&#xD;
After partaking of a lunch, the party&#xD;
returned to Stamford.&#xD;

that the democracy resort to a great many&#xD;
expedients for the purpose of catching&#xD;
votes. It was hardly fair for gentlemen to&#xD;
join the company of squatters who at-&#xD;
tended the convention."&#xD;
"That was not a whit more inexcusable&#xD;
than the log cabin trick of 1840, Judge&#xD;
Douglass."&#xD;
"Because Mr. Clay sought to protect&#xD;
the public domain from a set of land&#xD;
pirates, why, men who are surrounded&#xD;
by wealth, clothe themselves in rags, in&#xD;
order to personate the frontier-men."&#xD;
"Waiving the question altogether, of&#xD;
the propriety of forcing a class of citizens&#xD;
from the public lands at the point of the&#xD;
bayonet, who are doing more than all&#xD;
others to develop the resources of this&#xD;
country, there was no more deceit in the&#xD;
personation of squatters by men of fortune,&#xD;

"Not more than yours did the .Tackson&#xD;

ford; Monday he makes a speech at Ber-&#xD;

the populace at the Narrows."&#xD;
"How indefatigably Clifton has con-&#xD;
ducted the canvass. He has more than&#xD;
redeemed the pledges which you made&#xD;
for him in the ~&#xD;
"Yes; and his zeal and ability will be&#xD;
rewarded by a seat in Congress, at the&#xD;
next ~&#xD;
"So soon! Why he has not been in the&#xD;
state six years.'~&#xD;
"His popularity has been of rapid&#xD;
growth.~~&#xD;
Thd crowd at Thompson's Cross-roads&#xD;
was large and enthusiastic. Major Hen-&#xD;
derson, the whig candidate for the state&#xD;
at large desired to close the debate. To&#xD;
this Edward would not consent, as he&#xD;
claimed the right of terminating the dis-&#xD;
cussion alternately. The Whig orator was&#xD;
enraged, and mounting the stand, invited&#xD;
Clifton to meet him at Morgan's tavern,&#xD;
where there was to be a whig barbecue&#xD;
two days after. It was a vain boast, for&#xD;
&#xD;
143&#xD;
&#xD;
he knew that Edward had an appointment&#xD;
that day in the adjoining county. Con-&#xD;
trary to his expectations, the challenge&#xD;
was accepted, amidst the cheers of the&#xD;
democracy.&#xD;
Morgan's tavem was situated in a neigh-&#xD;
bourhood almost entirely inhabited by&#xD;
whigs, and Henderson anticipated that an&#xD;
overwhelming majority of his party would&#xD;
be present. In this expectation, too, he&#xD;
was disappointed. About a dozen miles&#xD;
from the place of meeting, was a portion&#xD;
of country densely settled by democrats,&#xD;
a hardy and inflexible body of men, 'vho&#xD;
could muster five hundred votes at the&#xD;
polls, or wield five hundred bludgeons in&#xD;
a fight. Col. Miller exercised an unlimited&#xD;
control over this clan, and to his house&#xD;
Edward directed his steps, after he had&#xD;
accepted the proposition of Major Hen-&#xD;
derson. Miller was a gentleman of large&#xD;
possessions, and lived in princely style,&#xD;
upon the shore of a beautiful lake.&#xD;
Clifton was welcomed with much cor-&#xD;
diality by Col. Miller.&#xD;
"1 should have gone over to listen to&#xD;
your speech, to-day, but for unavoidable&#xD;
business engagements. Here, Frank-take&#xD;
the gentleman's horse. That is a fine&#xD;
animal, Mr. Clifton." And he looked ad-&#xD;
miringly upon the black steed.&#xD;
"He has done me g5od service during&#xD;
the canvass. In a few days he shall have&#xD;
rest."&#xD;
"Yes, the election will soon be over.&#xD;
Come in, the air is chilly ~s night ap-&#xD;
proaches. Excuse me for a moment."&#xD;
Edward seated himself by the cheerful&#xD;
wood fire, and examined the furniture~ of&#xD;
the parlour. It was furnished with Eastem&#xD;
splendour. The velvet carpet was from&#xD;
the choicest looms of Brussels, the sofas&#xD;
and chairs, manufactured from paper&#xD;
mache, were inlaid with pearl, and the&#xD;
curtains were made of the richest broca-&#xD;
telle. One of Chickering's pianos was&#xD;
open, and the pieces of music which were&#xD;
scattered upon the stand, proved that the&#xD;
artiste had just left the instrument. It was&#xD;
not often that our hero had passed a night&#xD;
in such luxurious quarters during the can-&#xD;
vass. He heard the soft rustling of silk,&#xD;
and rose to his feet.&#xD;
"My daughter, Mr. Clifton."&#xD;
Edward bowed to a lovely           ho&#xD;
could scarcely number seventeen year&#xD;
although her form was above the medium&#xD;
height, and her proportions were round&#xD;
and fiowino' Her eyes were deep blue,&#xD;
fringed wit~i black lashes, her nose was&#xD;
Grecian, the cheeks dimpled and bloom-&#xD;

ing, and her manner indescribably fresh&#xD;
and piquant.&#xD;
"Do you know, Mr. Clifton," she said,&#xD;
frankly extending her hand, "your want&#xD;
of attention came very near making me&#xD;
turn my coat?"&#xD;
"What, become a whig 3"&#xD;
"Yes. I have never been so neglected&#xD;
before. Can you expect ladies to remain&#xD;
firmly wedded to their principles, without&#xD;
being noticed, any more than men? And&#xD;
don't you have to keep a vigilant eye upon&#xD;
the unterrified and unshaken-and in some&#xD;
cases the unshaved, if not the unwashed&#xD;
democracy-to prevent deser~on from the&#xD;

"That is because your competitor was&#xD;
more politic than yourself. You don't&#xD;
know my influence. Papa controls a twenty&#xD;
score of votes, and he does almost every-&#xD;
thingl ask him. You see there are breakers&#xD;
ahead."&#xD;
"If I had known there was so much at&#xD;
stake, I would have paid my devoirs at an&#xD;
earlier day.~~&#xD;
"You would not have left it ~to chance&#xD;
to bring you at last, eh 3 You need im-&#xD;
provement-as a politician, I mean. It is&#xD;
unpardonable not to know all the influ-&#xD;
ences which affect the ballot-box."&#xD;
"Take me under your protection."&#xD;
"If you prove an apt scholar, perhaps&#xD;
I may. Do you suppose I can shape you&#xD;
into a respectable candidate for Congress 3"&#xD;
"Pardon *me; I have no such amipi-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"Of course not! I never saw a person&#xD;
who had. Still you all accept nomina-&#xD;
tions, and if elected rarely resign; or if&#xD;
you do, it is that resignation which pockets&#xD;
the honours, and the-salary."&#xD;
"Suppose I have aspirations for a seat&#xD;
in Congress 3"&#xD;
"You can be nominated and elected."&#xD;
"But I am barely old enough.~~&#xD;
"That makes no difference. 'There is&#xD;
a tide in the affairs of men which taken at&#xD;
the flood,'-you know the rest. Besides,&#xD;
I think voters, like women, are rather&#xD;
partial to young men."&#xD;
"Will you yield me your support, while&#xD;
you are giving direction to my ambition 3"&#xD;
"That depends upon your encounter&#xD;
with Major Henderson. He is so unscru-&#xD;
pulous that I would do almost anything to&#xD;
see him overthrown. He thinks his powers&#xD;
as an orator are matchless."&#xD;
"Will you listen to the discussion? I&#xD;
do not know how a champion could fail&#xD;
when fighting beneath such eyes."&#xD;
"Come now, Mr. Clifton, that was well&#xD;
&#xD;
said. I like to see a person keep a sto~k&#xD;
of compliments on hand. I always do."&#xD;
Supper was announced.&#xD;
"Where is Brother Malcolm, mother?"&#xD;
"He went over the lake to see the&#xD;
Mortons. He should have been back,&#xD;
though, before this."&#xD;
"You will like Malcolm, Mr. Clifton,&#xD;
if you are, as I have heard, a strict con-&#xD;
structionist."&#xD;
"I am politically; if I was socially, I&#xD;
might take exception to some of your&#xD;
speeches."&#xD;
"Has Augusta been saying sharp&#xD;
things 3" inquired Col. Miller.&#xD;
Yes; she shoots with a long ~&#xD;
"That is her nature; she spares no one.&#xD;
Even I am not always safe. And so you&#xD;

"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"He is the m~ost unscrupulous politician&#xD;
in the whig ranks, and coupled with hi~&#xD;
unquestionable talents, it renders him a&#xD;
formidable opponent. Have you met him&#xD;
during the canvass 3"&#xD;
"Twice only.~~&#xD;
"And how did he bear himself?"&#xD;
icCourteously.~~&#xD;
"He knows with whom to trifle. It is a&#xD;
part of his tactic~ to have the whigs con-&#xD;
stitute a majority of the crowd whom he&#xD;
addresses."&#xD;
"So I understand."&#xD;
"And he is~equally fond of closing the&#xD;
debate. Who will terminate it at Mor-&#xD;
Q.~fl~5 ~"&#xD;
'~I shall."&#xD;
"Very well. It shall be my duty to&#xD;
foil the Major in his anticipations of having&#xD;
a one-sided affair. it is a whig barbecue,&#xD;
but I understood you to say that the demo-&#xD;
crats were invited to attend."&#xD;
"With much ~&#xD;

neighbourhood, and five hundred demo-&#xD;
crats shall back you at Morgan's. I hope&#xD;
Malcolm will return to-night. Ah, here he&#xD;
comes. I believe you are acquainted."&#xD;
The young men greeted each other with&#xD;
much cordiality.&#xD;
"Will you favour me with a song, Miss&#xD;
Augusta 3"&#xD;
"Certainly; what will you have?"&#xD;
"Any one ybu please.~~&#xD;
The maiden seated herself at the piano,&#xD;
and after running her fingers skilfully&#xD;
over the keys, she sang, with a voice of&#xD;
exquisite sweetness, the plaintive words of&#xD;
Byron,&#xD;
"The day of my destiny Is over."&#xD;
&#xD;
Edward yielded to the power of melody,&#xD;
and his imagination still hovered in the&#xD;
realm of song, long after the strings&#xD;
ceased their vibrations.&#xD;
She resumed her seat upon the sofa.&#xD;
"What words for you to sing !"&#xD;
"Why 3"&#xD;
"Th&amp;amp;y are far too sad for one whose&#xD;
spirits are so buoyant and gay as thine."&#xD;
"You surely do not suppose that my&#xD;
heaven is always unclouded? Ah, no! I&#xD;
am not exempt from the general doom,&#xD;
that mars the joy and crushes the hopes of&#xD;
frail mortality."&#xD;
"If you are unhappy, who can escape&#xD;
the decrees of inexorable fate 3"&#xD;
"No one. There are moments when I&#xD;
am indescribably happy. But ~they are&#xD;
precursors of sadness and gloom. My&#xD;
emotions are often typified by the lake.&#xD;
Come with me."&#xD;
She raised a curtain, a~d opening the&#xD;
blinds of a window which was l~alf con-&#xD;
cealed in a charming alcove, disc ~osed the&#xD;
waters of the lake, as the placid ~heet re-&#xD;
flected the light of the moon.&#xD;
"See, That portion of the lake nearest&#xD;
this shore has a mirror-like transparency;&#xD;
but yonder, the surface is curled into&#xD;
gentle ripples by the breeze, as it moves&#xD;
over the water. The element is no longer&#xD;
quiet. Its tranquillity is disturbed, arid&#xD;
within an hour its bosom will be lashed&#xD;
into foam. Such is life; fluctuating, un-&#xD;
even, incomprehensible.~~&#xD;
The view was cheerless. The forest&#xD;
was clothed in undress, the dew was con-&#xD;
gealing into frostwork, arid the cold wind&#xD;
sighed mournfully through the leafless&#xD;
branches of the hickory and the oak.&#xD;
Closing the blinds, they returned to the fire.&#xD;
"Do you play backgammon, Mr. Clif-&#xD;
ton?"&#xD;
"Quite well, I flatter myself."&#xD;
"Would you like to play 3"&#xD;
"Very much."&#xD;
The board was pro(luced. Clifton ob-&#xD;
served that it was ornamented with mosaic-&#xD;
work, and judged that it came from a&#xD;
Chinese manufactory. They were both&#xD;
skilful players, but the lady was not so&#xD;
stoical under defeat as her opponent, and&#xD;
she occasionally threw the box (lown, as&#xD;
ill-luck followed the dice. At last, when&#xD;
he had taken up three ~f the white pieces,&#xD;
and she could cuter neither, the men were&#xD;
all suddenly shaken together, and his&#xD;
triumph was prevented.&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Clifton, am 't you ashamed&#xD;
to move the box in that way 3"&#xD;
"That is a good joke. You remind me&#xD;
of a lad who entered Dr. Fielding's office,&#xD;
it)&#xD;
&#xD;
and while examining some object of curi-&#xD;
osity upon the shelf, precipitated a dozen&#xD;
bottles of medicine upon the floor. With-&#xD;
out waiting to be assailed, he promptly&#xD;
inquired, 'Dr. Fielding, nre you as mean&#xD;
as ever 3' Becoming the accused, when&#xD;
he intended to be the accuser the Doctor&#xD;
was nonplussed. Neither of'you, how-&#xD;
ever, can be charged with singularity. It&#xD;
is a way the world has of shifting respon-&#xD;
sibility."&#xD;
"I believe you say truly. Few of us&#xD;
are willing~ to assume the full responsi-&#xD;
bility of all our actions. But the common&#xD;
enemy has not been idle. It is late Good&#xD;
night; may sweet dreams be thine !"&#xD;
"They will be, if sleeping follow the&#xD;
waking thoughts"&#xD;
After breakfast the next morning, Col.&#xD;
Miller and Edward proceeded to examine&#xD;
the plantation. He had seventy able-&#xD;
bodied, and healthy negro men, whose&#xD;
cheerful faces proved that they were hap-&#xD;
py and contented.&#xD;
"I will first show you my tobacco es-&#xD;
tablishment; that I keep separate from&#xD;
my other buildings, because there is more&#xD;
~langer of fire."&#xD;
"How much tobacco did you raise this&#xD;
year 3"&#xD;
"I have no certain means of judging,&#xD;
as it is not all pressed yet. I planted&#xD;
about twenty acres."&#xD;
They entered an immense stone build-&#xD;
ing, divided off into various apartments.&#xD;
In the first room, a large quantity of tobac-&#xD;
co was suspended over a fire for the pur-&#xD;
pose of "curing" it. This is effected by&#xD;
the smoke and heat. Passing into another&#xD;
room, Edward saw a dozen slaves engag-&#xD;
ed in "stemming" tobacco.&#xD;
"I thought this branch of the business&#xD;
was done by large establishments?"&#xD;
"It is. but as I have a force sufficiently&#xD;
strong, I extract the stems and&#xD;
tobacco myself."      ,     press the&#xD;
"You prepare it for market yourself,&#xD;
then 3"&#xD;
"Invariably."&#xD;
They entered the press-re . Here&#xD;
some stalwart fellows were rowing the&#xD;
leaves into hogsheads.&#xD;
"This tobacco," said Col. Miller as he&#xD;
placed a leaf in Edward's hand, "i's from&#xD;
seed which I procured in Cuba; I think&#xD;
the quality is quite as fine as that which&#xD;
they raise either in Florida or upon James&#xD;
River.~'&#xD;
"Why do you not manufacture it, then 3"&#xD;
"I have made arrangements to do so&#xD;

"Re was taken sick this morning, sir,&#xD;

"Has Dr. Manton seen Philip ?"&#xD;
"Yes sir! He says he has the bilious&#xD;
fever."&#xD;
"Very well, you must see that he is&#xD;
properly nursed; you know that he is one&#xD;
of the most valuable slaves on the planta-&#xD;

" Ay, sir."&#xD;
"How is Phebe ?"&#xD;
"Almost recovered. Sally had twins&#xD;

"Yes, yourhonourand I told him so."&#xD;

"He stammered a little at first, and&#xD;
then responded with a grin, which dis-&#xD;

"Massa Meredith, Ise no wus than&#xD;

"The slanderous villain. Is he the one&#xD;
whose voice is so loud in prayer?"&#xD;
"The same, sir."&#xD;
"I believe he is not the only person in&#xD;
the world, Mr. Clifton, whose conduct&#xD;
does not keep pace with his professions."&#xD;
"if please, Col. Miller," said the&#xD;
overseer; "Pilot wants to marry Phillis."&#xD;
"Is her mother willing ?"&#xD;
CC Yes, sir.~~&#xD;
"Send him to me. Mr. Clifton, we will&#xD;
now visit the cotton gin ~&#xD;
CC Do you raise cotton, too ?"&#xD;
"Oh yes, a dozen acres."&#xD;
They approached a frame building, in&#xD;
which there were immense quantities of&#xD;
cottoii, some of it prepared and ready for&#xD;
market, while a large amount had only&#xD;
been removed from the boll.&#xD;
"The cotton gin is almost indispensa-&#xD;
ble. How did you ever do without it ?"&#xD;
~ The process of extracting the seeds&#xD;
was slow, and laborious. We are under&#xD;
great obligations to the inventor of the&#xD;
machine; without it we could not supply&#xD;
the world with~ cotton."&#xD;
"Well, Pilot, what do yon want?"&#xD;
The question was addressed to a pow-&#xD;
erful negro, who stood awkwardly twirl-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing his hat, as he cast furtive glances at&#xD;
his master.&#xD;
"Speak out, fellow; you have not been&#xD;
guilty of any misconduct, have you ?"&#xD;
"No, nu~massa, ony Ise fallen in lub&#xD;
wid Miss Phillis."&#xD;
"And you want to marry her ?"&#xD;
"If you please, massa, I should like to&#xD;
be united to her in matrorny.~~&#xD;
"Will you make her a kind and affec-&#xD;
tionate husband ?"&#xD;
"Sartin, massa, I will shiel her from de&#xD;
winds ob de heaven."&#xD;
"Very well then, marry her. But recol-&#xD;
lect, if you do not treat her kindly, I will&#xD;
sell you."&#xD;
"Neber fear, massa !" and the happy&#xD;
fellow walked off with stately dignity, for&#xD;
a few steps; and then, unable to restrain&#xD;
his feelings he exclaimed, "Phillis am&#xD;
mine !" and then followed those feats by&#xD;
which an African indicates his pleasure.&#xD;
He threw himself upon the ground, and&#xD;
rolling over several times, he at last sprang&#xD;
up, and rapidly turned several somersets.&#xD;
He finished his demonstration by throwing&#xD;
his arms around a negro who was leaning&#xD;
upon a post, and squeezed him against&#xD;
the timber with such violence, that lie&#xD;
fairly writhed with pain.&#xD;
"Slaves rarely make cruel husbands,"&#xD;
observed Col. Miller; "but it is well,&#xD;
nevertheless, to keep them under a whole-&#xD;
some re5trainit.~'&#xD;
"How do they bear separation from&#xD;
their partners and children ?~'&#xD;
"I have never had occasion to sell any.&#xD;
They are sometimes, however, separated&#xD;
by execution sales, or when the property&#xD;
is divided between heirs. I have obsesv-&#xD;
ed, that they adapt themselves~ to circum-&#xD;
stances more readily than whites. If&#xD;
husband and wife are separated, they&#xD;
soon marry again. Their affections will&#xD;
not bear the test of time."&#xD;
"I am afraid infidelity is not confined&#xD;
altogether to the black r~ce,'~ replied&#xD;
Clifton.&#xD;
"As for the unhappiness caused by the&#xD;
separation of relations, it is I not so great&#xD;
as that which is hourly ~vitmessed among&#xD;
the whites. But the abolitionists say that&#xD;
in oiie case it is voluntary. The assertion&#xD;
is untrue. Thousands, in this country,&#xD;
are separated from their kindred by de-&#xD;
crees as irresistible as that which transfers&#xD;
the slave to another State. Look at the&#xD;
Irish, the subjects of the philanthropic go-&#xD;

"Adjust your net, Plato."&#xD;
The negro made a circuit, and placed&#xD;
the snare beside a fallen tree, whose trunk&#xD;
was lying parallel to the course which&#xD;
the game were taking. The net was a&#xD;
dozea feet in length with a mouth six feet&#xD;

The next attempt was more successful.&#xD;
The slaves commenced singing a low and&#xD;

were driven into the snare and secured.&#xD;

The sun had disappeared, and the&#xD;
shades of night began to steal across the&#xD;
water as Clifton and Miss Miller landed&#xD;
upon the beach. A cheerful wood fire-&#xD;
that luxury of the country- welcomed&#xD;
them to the parlour.&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Clifton, I hope you have&#xD;

They proceeded to a church which had&#xD;
been erected upon the border of the negro&#xD;
dabins.&#xD;
"I require my slaves to attend this&#xD;

"Who dispenses the word of God to&#xD;

"They are probably more punctilious,&#xD;
because their salutations are always re-&#xD;

The bride and groom now entered the&#xD;
church. She was dressed in white, with&#xD;
a profusion of pink and orange-coloured&#xD;
bows attached to various portions of her&#xD;
robe. Her wavy hair, which would have&#xD;
been the envy of a modern belle, was&#xD;

vat, and a salmon-coloured vest. As the&#xD;
African preacher was in the act of com-&#xD;
mencing the ceremony, the waiting-maid&#xD;
of Miss Miller advanced up the aisle,&#xD;
bearing in her hand a magnificent wreath&#xD;
and-a large bouquet. As she delivered&#xD;
the latter to the bride, and arranged the&#xD;
former gracefully upon her head, there&#xD;
was a vehement and prolonged demon-&#xD;
stration of applause throughout the build-&#xD;
ing, accompanied by complimentary allu-&#xD;
sions to their young mistress.&#xD;
"She am a pressed lady, so kind and&#xD;
'siderate."&#xD;
"I could die for Miss 'Gusra; yes, dat&#xD;
I could."&#xD;
One, more enthusiastic than the rest,&#xD;
sprang upon a bench and exclaimed:&#xD;
"Gentlemens, dis perliteness and affer-&#xD;
bility calls for proper 'preciation. I pur-&#xD;
pose three cheers for Miss 'Gusta." And&#xD;
they were given with a will.&#xD;
The venerable preacher commenced&#xD;
the ceremony.&#xD;
Do you, Pilot Miller,* take dis lady&#xD;
for to be your lawful, wedded wife; do&#xD;
you promise to clung to her through sick-&#xD;
ness and health, till def part urn? Do you,&#xD;
Phillis Miller, accep dis gerablem for your&#xD;
lawful, wedded husband; will you, for-&#xD;
saken by all others, cleft unto him alone&#xD;
till def do you sundy? Den I pronounce&#xD;
dem husband' and wife."&#xD;
"Is a marriage ceremony performed by&#xD;
a slave regarded by the negroes as bind-&#xD;
ing between them'?" inquired Clifton.&#xD;
"Always. This preacher is held in&#xD;
as much veneration by my people, as the&#xD;
most learned divine is by an admiring&#xD;
congregation. His age and piety com-&#xD;
mand universal respect. Besides, mar-&#xD;
riage is considered, even among white&#xD;
people, as a civil contract merely, which&#xD;
can be formed without the agency of a&#xD;
clergyman."&#xD;
"Do your negroes ever intermarry with&#xD;
slaves who do not belong to you P&#xD;
"It very rarely happens, and for a cu-&#xD;
rious reason. The slaves h ave an aristo-&#xD;
cracy of their own. Those who belong to&#xD;
wealthy individuals, lawyers, successful&#xD;
politicians, or distinguished officers, hold&#xD;
themselves apart from the coloured fra-&#xD;
ternity whom they consider less fortunate.&#xD;
I happen to own vastly more negro pro-&#xD;
perty than any of my neighbours, and&#xD;
hence they are very aristocratic."&#xD;
"They do not like poorpeople, ~&#xD;
* The slaves often assume the names of -their mas-&#xD;
ters.&#xD;
&#xD;
"They have a mortal aversion to any&#xD;
one who is poverty-stricken, whether he is&#xD;
white or black. It is the prominent fea-&#xD;
ture in the negro character. I have often&#xD;
been amused by the conversation of my&#xD;
slaves, when they thought my attention&#xD;
was directed to something else. Hark!&#xD;
we will hear it illustrated now."&#xD;
"Ise tell what, Sambo, youve been&#xD;

"Well, I don't seed, 'cause why a gal&#xD;

"Dat is caze your dedication hab been&#xD;

"Ladies, Sambo, ladies;you must draw&#xD;

ladies and gemblem P&#xD;
"You hab defined the extinction cor-&#xD;
respondingly, Miss Dinah."&#xD;
These leaders of the ton then changed&#xD;
the subject of conversation.&#xD;
They returned to the parlour.&#xD;
"Your present was received, Augusta,&#xD;
with vociferous applause."&#xD;
"I am glad of it, for Phillis is a faithful&#xD;
girl; was the wedding a distingu~ affairV'&#xD;
"Quite so. All the aristocratic negroes&#xD;
in the neighbourhood were present."&#xD;
"I hope you have provided a bountiful&#xD;
supper for them."&#xD;
"Everything in abundance."&#xD;
At a late hour, a violin, flute, and tam-&#xD;
borine were heard beneath the parlour&#xD;
window. A lively air was executed with&#xD;
much skill, and then a well-modulated&#xD;
voice sang the words of a popular song.&#xD;
An immense number of persons joined in&#xD;
the chorus~ and the melody now swelled&#xD;
with a powerful volume upon the breeze,&#xD;
and anon floated low and whisperingly&#xD;
away.&#xD;
"It is the Harmonic ~ said Miss&#xD;
Augusta.&#xD;
"Can it be possible they are negroes~~&#xD;
Without an exception. They are all&#xD;
our own."&#xD;
A succession of beautiful airs followed&#xD;
each other, and among the rest, a cele-&#xD;
brated corn-shucking song. This consisted&#xD;
of words composed ad libilum by the&#xD;
leader; its chief feature, however, being&#xD;
the splendid chorus. To every Southerner,&#xD;
this song is as familiar as "household&#xD;
words." Miss Miller threw open the case-&#xD;
ment, and stepped out upon the balcony.&#xD;
No sooner had the rays of the moon lighted&#xD;
up her features, than her presence was&#xD;
hailed by the waving of handkerchiefs,&#xD;
and lou d huzzas. Each member of the&#xD;
dark assemblage cherished a reverent at-&#xD;
tachment for their beautiful mistress.&#xD;
At midnight, a profound repose had set-&#xD;
tled alike upon the gorgeous mansion, and&#xD;
the lowly cabins. The owner calmly slum-&#xD;
bered in the midst of loyal hearts, whose&#xD;
pulsations acknowledged the power of&#xD;
kindness and affection.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
"He's st~tnding in the market: round him throng&#xD;
the burghers, and by torchlight he harangues them."&#xD;
K0TZEBUE.&#xD;
Tnu messengers of Ccl. Miller had&#xD;
ridden far and fast, and by the setting sun,&#xD;
they returned wearied to the mansion.&#xD;
The democracy had been summoned to&#xD;
the gathering. Along the shore of the&#xD;
Lake, in the valley of its tributaries, o'er&#xD;
barrens, hill, and dale, the warning voice&#xD;
had been heard. Horsemen were seen&#xD;
winding along the by-paths and lanes,&#xD;
through forests and over streams, single&#xD;
and in pairs, until by eleven o'clock they&#xD;
had accumulated into masses, and swept&#xD;
along the principal thoroughfares towards&#xD;
the place of meeting. The whig leaders&#xD;
looked aghast at this unexpected demon-&#xD;
stration. Where they expected to be al-&#xD;
most the entirety of the crowd, they found&#xD;
themselves in a hopeless minority. A&#xD;
large number of ladies honoured the occa-&#xD;
sion with their presence, and among the&#xD;
number wa~ Miss Miller, who had driven&#xD;
over in her father's carriage with Clifton.&#xD;
She had no sooner arrived upon the ground,&#xD;
than Major Henderson-who under a bland&#xD;
exterior concealed the chagrin which the&#xD;
gathering of the democracy occasioned&#xD;
him-paid his respects to the Lady of the&#xD;
Lake, as she had been designated.&#xD;
"I am most happy to see you, Miss&#xD;
Miller, although you are found in loco-foco&#xD;
society."&#xD;
"You are very kind, Major Henderson.&#xD;
I fancy you do find rather too many De-&#xD;
mocrats in my train :" and she cast her&#xD;
eyes over the vast body of men who still&#xD;
hovered upon a neighboring hill, await-&#xD;
ing the arrival of Col. Miller.&#xD;
"Oh, no!Iam always willing to con-&#xD;
vert unbelievers to the true faith."&#xD;
"That changes so often, it is hard to tell&#xD;
what it is. But even if it was like the&#xD;
laws of the Medes and Persians, your ef-&#xD;
forts would be hopeless against the immu-&#xD;
table principles of yonder multitude."&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton, you have an accomplished&#xD;
assistant. You would do well to attach&#xD;
her fortunes to yours in ~&#xD;
Edward was, for a moment, embar-&#xD;
rassed by this direct allusion, and he was&#xD;
also slightly indignant; because he knew it&#xD;
was intended to annoy Miss Miller.&#xD;
"The political fidelity of Miss Augusta,&#xD;
although more unchangeable than that of&#xD;
some whigs I could name, is nevertheless&#xD;
surpassed by her domestic accomplish-&#xD;
ments. Either as a republican, or a pri-&#xD;
vate companion, any gentleman would be&#xD;

&#xD;
honoured in winning her hand. I could&#xD;
not say more; perhaps I ought to have&#xD;
said less."&#xD;
The blush which had tinged the cheek&#xD;
of the maiden at the allusion of Major&#xD;
Henderson, overspread her countenance&#xD;
before Edward had concluded. Whether&#xD;
the emotion was produced by pleasure or&#xD;
pain, he did not attempt to learn, as she&#xD;
turned away her head.&#xD;
"Well, then, as I can accomplish&#xD;
nothing by a political controversy, let me&#xD;
make myself agreeable in another way.&#xD;
As you are so learned, it is a difficult task.&#xD;
Shall I converse in Spanish'?"&#xD;
"You had better first learn to walk&#xD;
Spanish."&#xD;
"Ha! ha! Major, you will have to give&#xD;
it up."&#xD;
"I believe I shall. Yonder comes your&#xD;
father with his legions, Miss Miller. I&#xD;
must vent my indignation upon them."&#xD;
"It will prove as powerless as your wit.&#xD;
Au revoir." ~&#xD;
The stand had been erected in a grove,&#xD;
and thither the orators and the crowd held&#xD;
their way. Both speakers had become cele-&#xD;
brated. Henderson had long maintained&#xD;
a high reputation at the bar, and he was&#xD;
now regarded the most accomplished&#xD;
stump speaker in the Whig ranks. Clifton&#xD;
was more youthful, but during the canvass&#xD;
he had triumphed over all competitors ex-&#xD;
cept Major Henderson. This was the third&#xD;
time the two champions had met, and both&#xD;
parties raised a prolonged shout as they&#xD;
ascended the stand. The two preceding&#xD;
encounters had been considered drawn&#xD;
battles. Major Henderson opened the de-&#xD;
bate. In his splendid exordium, he re-&#xD;
marked that it was difficult to follow the&#xD;
doctrines of the Democratic party, because&#xD;
they were always "changing their bat-&#xD;
teries." He denounced the annexation of&#xD;
Texas, advocated a tariff discriminating in&#xD;
favour of protection, the abolition of the&#xD;
veto power, and the distribution of the&#xD;
proceeds of the sales of the public lands.&#xD;
He as repeatedly interrupted by ap-&#xD;
plau~e, and as he sat~down, loud cheers&#xD;
were given by the whigs. But their shouts&#xD;
were like the sighing wind compared to&#xD;
the raging tempest which greeted Clifton,&#xD;
as he rose to reply. Nothing so elevates&#xD;
a public speaker as applause. It buoys&#xD;
him up with a power that no subject pos-&#xD;
sesses, however inspiriting. With a throb-&#xD;
bing heart, Edward acknowledged the&#xD;
cheers of the democracy, and then pre-&#xD;
pared to answer the speech of his oppo-&#xD;
nent.&#xD;
"When I accepted," he said, "the chal-&#xD;
&#xD;
lenge of Major Henderson to meet him&#xD;
here today, I did so with the expectation&#xD;
of addressing an audience almost entirely&#xD;
composed of whigs. How grateful to my&#xD;
feelings is it, then, to witness this vast&#xD;
assemblage, whose hearts beat responsive-&#xD;
ly to my own! I am under great obliga-&#xD;
tions to him" (and he bowed to Col. Mil-&#xD;
ler) "who has won your affection by his&#xD;
virtues, for a reception as gratifying as it&#xD;
was une expected.&#xD;
"The gentleman commenced his speech&#xD;
with the charge that the democracy are&#xD;
constantly 'changing their batteries.' If he&#xD;
means that we have to employ flying ar-&#xD;
tillery for the purpose of assailing posi-&#xD;
tions which his party assumes one hour,&#xD;
to be abandoned the next; I acknow ledge&#xD;
the fidelity of the simile. But if, on the&#xD;
contrary, he insinuates that the democracy&#xD;
change their principles, the accusation is&#xD;
gratuitous and unjust. 'Changing our bat-&#xD;
teries'?' It comes with a bad grace from&#xD;
him to make such an assertion. I hold in&#xD;
my hand an address issued by that gen-&#xD;
tleman scarcely one year ago, to the elec-&#xD;
tors of this congressional district. He was&#xD;
thea a candidate for Congress. Here it&#xD;
is, with the name of G. A. Henderson at-&#xD;
tached. Does the gentleman intend to&#xD;
put in the plea of non est factum? No'?&#xD;
He is prudent; the document, although&#xD;
not old, is still a 'dangerous thing !'* In&#xD;
this circular he declared that he would&#xD;
first discuss the question which he regard-&#xD;
ed as more important than all others-the&#xD;
question of the currency. To-day, he has&#xD;
addressed you for one hour and thirty&#xD;
minutes, and the xyord currency has not&#xD;
once passed his lips. Why is this omis-&#xD;
sioa'? Because political capital can no&#xD;
longer be made out of the currency ques-&#xD;
tion. That which was more important&#xD;
than all other questions in 1843, is deemed&#xD;
unworthy of a thought in 1844, by the gen-&#xD;
tleman who presumes to accuse the demo-&#xD;
cracy with 'changing their batteries'&#xD;
Thishit was loudly applauded by Clifton's&#xD;
friends, and he observed a pleased smile&#xD;
upon the countenance of Augusta Miller.&#xD;
"On the first Monday in May a meet-&#xD;
ing was held in Beaufort, for the purpose&#xD;
of advocating the annexation of Texas.&#xD;
Both political parties were represented. I&#xD;
had the honour of submitting the resolu-&#xD;
tions, which declared in unequivocal&#xD;
terms, that Texas had conquered her inde-&#xD;
* An assertion of Col. Polk, in his canvass for the&#xD;
Gubernatorial chair, in 1839, became celebrated&#xD;
ihroughont the Southern States. In reviewing the po-&#xD;
litical course of Governor Cannon he used to exclaim,&#xD;
"Old documents are dangerous things!"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
pendence-that no power had a right to&#xD;
forbid the union-that our refusal would&#xD;
force them to become slavish dependents&#xD;
of the British government, and that an-&#xD;
nexation was demanded by national policy&#xD;
and political considerations, of overwhelm-&#xD;
ing importance. Wduld you believe it&#xD;
possible that such resolutions were advo-&#xD;
cated and voted for, by the gentleman who&#xD;
has to-day denounced the Texas question&#xD;
asa 'humbug V And yet, he mendacious-&#xD;
ly charges the democracy with 'changing&#xD;
their batteries !' " The bitterness with&#xD;
which Edward revealed these scraps of&#xD;
history caused the Major to~ turn red and&#xD;
pale by turns, while the democracy raised&#xD;
their hats and 0-ave three tremendous&#xD;
huzzas. The ora~r caught a glimpse of&#xD;
two little hands, as they were applauding&#xD;
the skill with which he had thrown back&#xD;
the charge.&#xD;
"It cannot have escaped your observa-&#xD;
tion, that the principal objection urged by&#xD;
Major Henderson against the annexation&#xD;
of Texas, is based upon the assumption&#xD;
that it will involve us in a xvar with Great&#xD;
Britain. That the English government&#xD;
feel a deep interest in the question there&#xD;
cannot be the slightest doubt. Her agents&#xD;
here, in Mexico, and Texas, are employed&#xD;
with unwearied diligence in opposing the&#xD;
contemplated union. Her object is quite&#xD;
apparent. England would curtail the&#xD;
limits of every other power, while she is&#xD;
enlarging her own. That is the prominent&#xD;
feature in her national policy. It has em-&#xD;
ployed the talents, and commanded the&#xD;
exertions of her statesmen, for more than&#xD;
six hundred years. If I was an English-&#xD;
man I should not oppose the doctrine;&#xD;
being an American, it is my ditty to de-&#xD;
nounce it. As a private individual I must&#xD;
take care of my own household; as a ci-&#xD;
tizen of the republic, she will always claim&#xD;
me as one of her devoted worshippers.&#xD;
Great Britain wishes to defeat the annexa-&#xD;
tion of Texas, because it will extend our&#xD;
boundaries. The power of the United&#xD;
States is increasing with gigantic strides.&#xD;
Our commercial career threatens to rival&#xD;
that of England, and the day is not far dis-&#xD;
tant when the supremacy of the ocean&#xD;
will be transferred to the western hemi-&#xD;
sphere. Everything calculated to post-&#xD;
pone that event is eagerly sought for. The&#xD;
political existence of the government de-&#xD;
pends upon commerce. It enables the&#xD;
nobility to win the admiration of the vul-&#xD;
gar, by gorgeous~ display. It secures the&#xD;
fealty of the clergy with costly benefices.&#xD;
It retains the allegiance of the army and&#xD;
navy by vast expenditures. It pays the&#xD;
&#xD;
CLIFTON.                    153&#xD;
&#xD;
interest of the national debt, and thus se-&#xD;
cures the creditors of the government by&#xD;
the indissoluble bonds of interest. As&#xD;
liberal sentiments gain form and solidity&#xD;
in the British Isles, the expenditure of&#xD;
money must also increase, in order to&#xD;
control those opinions. If the commercial&#xD;
prosperity of the country is arrested, it will&#xD;
prove as fatal as a decline. Her career&#xD;
must necessarily be onward, and hence&#xD;
she is extending her dominions in the&#xD;
East with fire and sword. Where it is&#xD;
expedient, she opens ports and secures&#xD;
marketswith the persuasion and eloquence&#xD;
of a park of artillery!&#xD;
"Nut only will the acquisition of Texas&#xD;
increase our commercial importance, but&#xD;
it will prevent England from getting either&#xD;
a direct or an indirect control of the cot-&#xD;
ton lands in that State. A rupture with&#xD;
the United States would affect the stability&#xD;
of the British monarchy, by destroying&#xD;
her manufacturers. They must have cot-&#xD;
ton, and the absorption of Texas will give&#xD;
us the control of nearly all the valuable&#xD;
cottoniands in the world.&#xD;
"Now, then, we have seen the reasons&#xD;
why the Cabinet of Victoria are so active&#xD;
in attempting to defeat this meastire. Let&#xD;
us now see whether they have any right&#xD;
to interfere. It is an axiom quite as forci-&#xD;
ble in its applicability to nations as to in-&#xD;
dividuals, that a public exemplar must&#xD;
ascend the forum with unspotted garments.&#xD;
How does England stand this test. If&#xD;
there is one nation upon the face of God's&#xD;
earth more guilty than another of unscru-&#xD;
pulous rapacity, it is Great Britain. With,&#xD;
or without a pretext, she is year after year&#xD;
extending her limits in Asia. Nationality&#xD;
is extinguished, and whole principalities&#xD;
are swallowed by the insatiable cormorant.&#xD;
With bloody hands and distended stomach&#xD;
she comes to our door, to give us lessons&#xD;
in international law! Away with such&#xD;
cant and hypocrisy! it will not pass cur-&#xD;
rent here." "No! never! never !" shout-&#xD;
ed the indignant crowd.&#xD;
"She threatens us, say you'? So she did&#xD;
in 1775 and in 1812. Will her voice he&#xD;
silenced by submission'? Or is it the cor-&#xD;
rect doctrine to declare it as our unaltera-&#xD;
ble determination, not to submit to the&#xD;
slightest interference in the foreign policy&#xD;
of the United States'?" Another shout at-&#xD;
tested the popularity of his annunciation.&#xD;
The reply of Clifton was claimed by his&#xD;
friends as a triumphant refutation of his&#xD;
opponent's arguments, from beginning to&#xD;
end. Being no politician ourselves, btit&#xD;
only a faithful chronicler of our hero's sen-&#xD;
timents, we cannot decide between the&#xD;

&#xD;
two orators. It is sufficient to say that the&#xD;
democracy were enthusiastic, while the&#xD;
whigs were crestfallen, not only by the&#xD;
result of the debate, but because they had&#xD;
not provided sufficient provisions for the&#xD;
immense assemblage. Their chagrin was&#xD;
not a little increased by the waggery of&#xD;
two democrats, who had abstained from&#xD;
approaching the tables until the food was&#xD;
all consumed, when they remarked, "We&#xD;
have eaten nothing yet, and are very hun-&#xD;
gry. We presume, however, as the whigs&#xD;
invited us to partake of a feast, it will be&#xD;
forthcoming in due season." These re-&#xD;
marks produced shouts of laughter from&#xD;
the democracy at the annoyance which&#xD;
theygave the whigs.&#xD;
Clifton seated himself in the carriage&#xD;
with Miss Miller, and they proceeded&#xD;
homewards.&#xD;
"Well, you heard the discussion; do&#xD;
you nominate me for Congress Y'&#xD;
"Yes; I will not only nominate, but I&#xD;
will support you.. I was never so gratified&#xD;
as at the discomfiture of Major Hender-&#xD;
son. He is so vain."&#xD;
"But he is certainly a man of great elo-&#xD;
quence.~)&#xD;
"Undoubtedly; but he wants tact, and&#xD;
what is of far more importance, principle.&#xD;
What would he have given to-day if he&#xD;
had not issued that circular !"&#xD;
"It did embarrass him very much, but&#xD;
he could gain more votes when it was&#xD;
published by discussing the currency ques-&#xD;
tion than any other."&#xD;
Precisely so; and therefore he is con-&#xD;
trolled by expediency rather than prin-&#xD;
ciple."*&#xD;
The forest seemed alive with democrats;&#xD;
in all directions were heard their cheers&#xD;
and shouts, as they were returning to their&#xD;
homes. "Three cheers for Edward Clif-&#xD;
ton !" "Three for the lone star !" They&#xD;
were given with a power which sent their&#xD;
echoes over rock and hill. As the car-&#xD;
riage descended into the valley of the&#xD;
lake, there swelled upon the breeze the&#xD;
words of a popular song-&#xD;
"And we wiii vote&#xD;
For James K. Polk&#xD;
And George M. Dallas too."&#xD;
They alighted from the carriage, and&#xD;
entered the parlour, as the last rays of the&#xD;
sun glittered upon the tranquil waters of&#xD;
the lake. Augusta gazed upon the scene,&#xD;
and a shade of sadness crossed her coun-&#xD;

tenancy. As she turned 'towards him, the&#xD;
expressive eyes of her companion were&#xD;
observing her emotions.&#xD;
"Come, I shall lose my character for&#xD;
vivacity ;" and she ran her fingers over&#xD;
the keys of the piano, and sang the words&#xD;
of a lively air.&#xD;
"You think me a singular girl, do you&#xD;
not V' she inquired, as she advanced to&#xD;
the fire.&#xD;
"The most remarkable lady I have&#xD;

"Perhaps I will some time tell you my&#xD;

so like him." The servant announced that&#xD;
supper awaited them.&#xD;
Long before the hour appointed for Ed-&#xD;
ward to address the people at Stamford,&#xD;
the court-house was crowded. There&#xD;
was a large number of ladies in the as-&#xD;
semblage. More than five hundred per-&#xD;
sons bore torchlights in the procession.&#xD;
Upon each one Was inscribed, political&#xD;
devices, which elicited the cheers of the&#xD;
crowd as they passed along.&#xD;
On the day preceding the election,&#xD;
Clifton, addressed a large crowd at Ber-&#xD;
gen, and mounting his horse, accompanied&#xD;
by a few friends, he started for the Nar-&#xD;
rows, where he was to make his last&#xD;
speech. It was nearly dark before he left&#xD;
the village, and the place of meeting was&#xD;
thirteen miles distant. They proceeded&#xD;
rapidly along the road.&#xD;
"We must stop at Mallory's, Clifton, as&#xD;
we pass," said Harden.&#xD;
"We shall be too late, then, at the Nar-&#xD;
rows 'f"&#xD;
"No danger of that. They will not&#xD;
have the transparencies all the way from&#xD;
Stamford, before ten o'clock. Besides,&#xD;
Mallory expects us, and he would be of-&#xD;
fended if we did not call. He would think&#xD;
he was slighted because he is poor. Do&#xD;
you know he has named a child foryou~~~&#xD;
"Is it possible! I must call then."&#xD;
"At nine o'clock, they alighted at an&#xD;
humble log cabin. The door was thrown&#xD;
open, and a man of large and powerful&#xD;
frame emerged into the gloom. He was&#xD;
clad in homely apparel, but there was an&#xD;
honest sincerity and frankness in his man-&#xD;
ner, which at once attracted you towards&#xD;
him."&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Light, gents, 'light! Mr. Clifton, you&#xD;
are welcome. Mr. Harden, I am glad to&#xD;
see you. Here, Tom, take care of the&#xD;
horses. My old woman began to think&#xD;
you would not come."&#xD;
"The sun had disappeared before we&#xD;
left Bergen, and the darkness forced us to&#xD;
ride slowly.)~&#xD;
"Better late than never; come in. Wife,&#xD;
this is Mr. Clifton, Mr. Harden you know.&#xD;
Set down; the night is cold. Get out, Tiger!&#xD;
He always will seat himself in the cor-&#xD;
ner," he added apologetically.&#xD;
There were but two rooms in the log&#xD;
cabin, and the furniture was of the most&#xD;
simple kind. The table was made of&#xD;
pine boards, and was covered with a spot-&#xD;
less cotton tablecloth. It was loaded with&#xD;
a variety of dishes. which would have'&#xD;
tempted appetite of a gourmand.'&#xD;
Roasted pa bridges, roast duck, pig and tur-&#xD;
key, stewed chicken, and squirrels. Sweet&#xD;
potatoes, fried and baked, pies, puddings&#xD;
and tarts, with tea and coffee, and deli-&#xD;
cious cider to wash it down. The hungry&#xD;
politicians-not hungry in the New York&#xD;
acceptation of the term-feasted upon the&#xD;
viands. They had fasted since morning,&#xD;
and speaking and riding are wonderful&#xD;
tempters of the appetite. The good&#xD;
woman was evidently pleased at the mani-&#xD;
fest zest, with which her company applied&#xD;
themselves to the food, and she urged it&#xD;
upon them, with homely courtesy, until&#xD;
they could eat no more.&#xD;
"Where is my little namesake, Mrs.&#xD;
Mallory&#xD;
"I kept him awake to see you, until&#xD;
nearly nine o'clock. He is asleep now."&#xD;
"I must have a peep at him neverthe-&#xD;
less."&#xD;
The gratified mother took a light, and&#xD;
turning down the cover of a cradle, dis-&#xD;
closed the countenance of a lovely babe.&#xD;
"What a really fine child; how old&#xD;
is itT'&#xD;
"Not quite six months," replied Mrs.&#xD;
Mallory, and her heart warmed towards&#xD;
the admirer of her offspring.&#xD;
"What a forehead; how exquisite the&#xD;
contour of the head! That boy, Madam,&#xD;
will make a figure in the world"&#xD;
"Do you think so, Mr. Clifton ~ I wish&#xD;
you could see him awake."&#xD;
"Oh! he will have plenty of opportu-&#xD;
nities next summer, dame, when he is&#xD;
canvassing for Congress,~~ responded her&#xD;
husband.&#xD;
"I hope you will he nominated," she&#xD;
observed.&#xD;
"Thank you, Mrs. Mallory, for your&#xD;
&#xD;
good wishes: I am now in the hands of&#xD;
my party."&#xD;
"And they will be sure not to forget&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Come, Clifton, we must be going. It&#xD;
is nearly ten o'clock."&#xD;
"Will you not accompany us, Mr. Mal-&#xD;
lory 'P'&#xD;
"I don't know. What do you think of it,&#xD;
dame T'&#xD;
"Go by all means; let the crowd be as&#xD;
large as possible. I would go myself if it&#xD;
was not for the babe."&#xD;
"You have made a friend of my dame,&#xD;
for life, Mr. Clifton, by praising her child.&#xD;
The road to a mother's heart is through her&#xD;
offspring.~~&#xD;
At midnight, Edward had concluded a&#xD;
speech, which was pronounced the most&#xD;
splendid of all his efforts. Thus ended the&#xD;
canvass.&#xD;
The next da~ the grandest spectacle was&#xD;
witnessed whi~h is ever presented to&#xD;
the human race ,-the representatives of&#xD;
twenty millions of freemen assembling at&#xD;
the ballot-box, for the purpose of selecting&#xD;
a chief magistrate. The executive power&#xD;
does not descend, as of right, from father&#xD;
to son, imbecility does not grasp the sceptre&#xD;
which can alone be wielded with success&#xD;
by a mighty hand.&#xD;
The conflict was over; the smoke lifted&#xD;
from the battle-field, and the illustrious&#xD;
embodiment of whig principles, was once&#xD;
more seen flying amidst the dispersed and&#xD;
disordered ranks of his party. Fate had&#xD;
again thwarted his aspirations and baulk-&#xD;
ed his ambition. Will the future be more&#xD;
propitious, and hope again reassure the&#xD;
great pacificator ~&#xD;

ALICE HowARD's JoURNAL, "December,&#xD;
1844.-It has been several months since I&#xD;
opened this journal. I have been tolerably&#xD;
happy. If not perfectly so, it is not for want&#xD;
of admiration. I believe they take the&#xD;
natural buoyancy of my spirits for encou-&#xD;
ragement; if so, is it my fault ~ I cannot&#xD;
always appear sober and sedate. To-&#xD;
morrow I start for New York. Florence&#xD;
Brainard has so often desired me to visit&#xD;
her, that I can no longer decline. She re-&#xD;

sides in Union Square, which is now con-&#xD;
sidered the fashionable locality, though&#xD;
how long it will remain so is doubtful.&#xD;
The west end, in the Empire city, is migra-&#xD;
tory. I shall be in time to see the beaux&#xD;
on New Year's-There are hours when I&#xD;
am so unhappy. The void in my affec-&#xD;
tions cannot be filled. Fatal exercise&#xD;
of parental authority! how many hopes&#xD;
are wrecked by thy decrees! But I do&#xD;
not despair. There comes occasionally&#xD;
to my wearied soul, along the pathway of&#xD;
the future, a faint, low whisper, that all&#xD;
will yet be well.&#xD;
"New York, January 2, 1845. At eleven&#xD;
~clock yesterday, the visiting commenc-&#xD;
ed. Florence looked very lovely; and she&#xD;
was dressed with such exquisite taste!&#xD;
She does not exhibit such a fondness for&#xD;
contrasts, as many of the New York ladies,&#xD;
though I think there is a slight improve-&#xD;
ment in the fashions, in that respect. They&#xD;
still display a partiality forbright colours, in&#xD;
fashionable circles; but full dresses, which&#xD;
combine the hues of a rainbow, ar&amp;amp; now&#xD;
almost exclusively worn by the Bowery&#xD;
girls.&#xD;
"As for myself, Florence was kind&#xD;
enough to say that I was 'beautiful.'&#xD;
What cared I for the compliment! There&#xD;
is no one here whose admiration I seek&#xD;
to win. If I was in search of desirable&#xD;
beaux, I certainly should never think of&#xD;
coming to New York. What specimens!&#xD;
There were not more than haifa dozen who&#xD;
could claim the appellation of manhood.&#xD;
All the rest were below the medium&#xD;
height, slender, effeminate-looking crea-&#xD;
tures, whose greatest ambition it is to&#xD;
raise a sorel mustache, and dance the&#xD;
Polka. What a contrast to our Norman an-&#xD;
cestors! that unrivalled race of men, whose&#xD;
heroism in the camp, and gallantry in the&#xD;
court, made them the models for Europe's&#xD;
chivalry. How helpless Would the con-&#xD;
(lition of the 'beauty, and booty' of&#xD;
New York become, if its protection was&#xD;
entrusted to such miserable defenders!&#xD;
They would not go unwhipt from the pre-&#xD;
sence which they now enter, with so&#xD;
much assurance. Not that they are to be&#xD;
censured for their soft appearance ; that is&#xD;
the result of inconsiderate marriages. It&#xD;
cannot be expected, that dwarfs will give&#xD;
birth to giants. But they are to blame for&#xD;
constantly thrusting their diminished heads&#xD;
into the foreground. The ladies are by no&#xD;
means excusable for encouraging their&#xD;
advances. I know they attempt to justify&#xD;
it by the assertion, that a 'poor choate is&#xD;
better than none.' But they forget that by&#xD;
appearing to be satisfied with the 'poor&#xD;
&#xD;
~' T 0 N.&#xD;
~ they keep off the good ones. No&#xD;
gentleman, who has a particle of self-&#xD;
respect, will enter into a competition with&#xD;
such rivals, and consequently they will&#xD;
keep possession of the field, until they&#xD;
are brushed away. And they talk such&#xD;
perfect nonsense! I drew out several of&#xD;
them yesterday. They invariably com-&#xD;
menced;' Compliments of the season. Miss&#xD;
Howard. The day is excessively cold.&#xD;
Have you been to the opera yet'? Is not&#xD;
Barilli divine'? It is said she will soon be&#xD;
married to the son of a wealthy citizen.&#xD;
Ah, good morning.' They have caught&#xD;
the habit too of teetering from the New&#xD;
York ladies. It is bad enough for a&#xD;
female to keep bobbing up and down as&#xD;
though she was set on springs, or had St.&#xD;
Vitus's dance; her robe at least prevents&#xD;
the observer from discovering what cases&#xD;
the vibration. The ladies are beginning to&#xD;
regard the movement as anything but dig-&#xD;
nified, especially since a married lady&#xD;
who teetered excessively, has been sent&#xD;
to her parents by her husband, for an in-&#xD;
definite period. A young lady said a&#xD;
good thing to Mr. Black, a fe~v nights ago.&#xD;
She endured his teetering as long as it was&#xD;
sufferable, and then bluntly remarked~&#xD;
'Look here, Mr. Black! if you cannot&#xD;
stand like a gentleman, the sooner you&#xD;
leave me the better!'&#xD;
"But the New York beaux are not only&#xD;
blessed with an extraordinary amount of&#xD;
assurance, they are sometimes imper-&#xD;
tinent. At a party night before last, one&#xD;
of them peremporily desired some elderly&#xD;
married ladies to vacate a parlour which&#xD;
was wanted by the dancers. One of&#xD;
them protested against the rudeness of the&#xD;
request, when he flippantly responded-&#xD;
'You needn't find fault, madam; I have&#xD;
just turned my own mother out.' Where&#xD;
is the deference which is due the female&#xD;
sex'? Utterly unknown to these regulators&#xD;
of modern chivalry. And then they are&#xD;
so unmannerly at a supper-table. Instead&#xD;
of waiting until the ladies are helped,&#xD;
they form a barrier around the table, and&#xD;
with the obstinacy of curs, adhere to their&#xD;
positions until they can eat no more.&#xD;
"January 15, 1845.-I have been out&#xD;
almost every night. There is a perfect&#xD;
mania for parties. And then how much&#xD;
they dress! The lady of the house desires&#xD;
a crush. It is a matter of indifference how&#xD;
long her guests remain, so her rooms are&#xD;
crowded during a portion of the evening.&#xD;
They must not only be crowded, but it is&#xD;
desirable to have them thronged with&#xD;
splendidly-dressed ladies, and therefore&#xD;
females who have the money and the good&#xD;
&#xD;
CLIF&#xD;
&#xD;
taste to dress well, are often invited out.&#xD;
Our sex never dress Jor the gentlemen;&#xD;
always for each ottier. A good figure is,&#xD;
also considered important, as diamonds&#xD;
and dress show off better than upon a&#xD;
dwarfish person.&#xD;
"The rapid accumulation of pro erty&#xD;
cuts up the pretensions of the ~voul'd-be&#xD;
aristocracy of' the city. At a party a few&#xD;
nights ago, a tall and elegantly-dressed&#xD;
lady, who glittered with diamonds, at-&#xD;
tracted much attention. She was a tallow-&#xD;
chandler's daughter. Her father had be-&#xD;
come a millionaire-had given a magnifi-&#xD;
cent party. The fashionable at first hesi-&#xD;
tate(l; and then attended it. The daughter&#xD;
was in society at once. A name descend-&#xD;
ing for generations, is no more powerful&#xD;
in giving direction to fashion, than the man&#xD;
of yesterday. The old Knickerbockers are&#xD;
strangers in their own city. Their position&#xD;
has been usurped by a new race, whose&#xD;
movements are onward, progressive.&#xD;
"Yesterday the owner of a splendid&#xD;
equipage, and the proprietor of an es-&#xD;
tablishment in the court end, flatters him-&#xD;
self that his wife has become the leader&#xD;
of the ton. To-day he looks with amaze-&#xD;
ment upon a t~arriage more gorgeous than&#xD;
his own, as it (lashes along Broadway.&#xD;
Whose is it'? There is no coat of arms&#xD;
visible! Neither is there upon his own.&#xD;
Why should there'? one is a hatter and the&#xD;
other a tanner. The upstart cannot be put&#xD;
down because he is a plebeian. If blood&#xD;
is to be the criterion, the accuser may&#xD;
chance to find that his own but recently&#xD;
flowed in the veins of a cooper or a dray-&#xD;
man. That won't do; so the criterion is&#xD;
wealth at last. Anybody who has that,&#xD;
can move from East Broadway into Fifth&#xD;
Avenue; can take a box at the opera;&#xD;
patronise Ball, Tompkins, and Black; sport&#xD;
a fine pair of horses; give a grand party,&#xD;
and become~one of the fashionable. If&#xD;
Mrs. Smith hears Mrs. Brown whisper,&#xD;
'Oh! she was a tailor's daughter!' she can&#xD;
reply, 'Well, was not your father a shoe-&#xD;
maker'?' So at last they have to fall back&#xD;
upon their money. Mrs. Jones can sport&#xD;
her ermine tippet quite as gracefully, if&#xD;
her grandmother did beat furs, or if she&#xD;
was beaten herself because she did not&#xD;
beat furs. It only shows that Mrs. Jones&#xD;
is more fortunate than her grandmother,&#xD;
because she wears furs, instead of beating&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"If Mrs. White has succeeded in ele-&#xD;
vating her opera-glass gracefully, it cer-&#xD;
tainly can make no difference, if her father&#xD;
did succeed, after quite as much practice,&#xD;
&#xD;
TON.                             157&#xD;
in hooping barrels with precision and des-&#xD;
patch.&#xD;
"If Mrs. Black possesses the art of deli-&#xD;
cately coloring the cheek, when the rose&#xD;
has ceased to bloom, it does not diminish&#xD;
the skill of the toilette, because her parent&#xD;
used a larger brush-a greater variety of&#xD;
Saints.&#xD;
"If people desire to become fashion-&#xD;
able, they must become notorious. They&#xD;
must have more flowers at a party, more&#xD;
musicians; their carriage must be une-&#xD;
qualled, and their residence more gor-&#xD;
geous. They will then be talked about,&#xD;
and stared at.&#xD;
"That, at last, is the object of the am-&#xD;
bitious. The warrior, the statesman, the&#xD;
beauty, the fashionable, like to have the&#xD;
gaping multitude turn their heads to say,&#xD;
'There they go!' Ladies are as much in-&#xD;
fluenced by this passion as the sterner sex.&#xD;
One thing is certain, so far as New York&#xD;
society is concerned,-the vulgar of to-day&#xD;
may become the fashionable of to-morrow.&#xD;
Not the vulgar in manners, but the vulgar&#xD;
in position; although it is by no means&#xD;
rare, that a change of position is unac-&#xD;
companied by that refinement which is so&#xD;
essential in polished society. The Ameri-&#xD;
cans are, however, quick of perception,&#xD;
and with surpassing readiness accomumo-&#xD;
(late themselves to the new sphere into&#xD;
which they are thrown. If at their first&#xD;
party there are plenty of coopers and&#xD;
tailors, there will be fewer next time, and&#xD;
at last none but the fashionable will be&#xD;
seen in their saloons.&#xD;
"These transitions occur, more or less,&#xD;
in all American cities; not so frequently&#xD;
in Philadelphia, still less in Boston. Even&#xD;
in England-that country of boasted an-&#xD;
cestry and hereditary titles-wealth often&#xD;
elevates the vulgar to a municipal position&#xD;
which brings them in contact with royalty&#xD;
itself. I am not placing these thoughts in&#xD;
my journal because I justify this universal&#xD;
scramble after the dross of the earth. In-&#xD;
dependence has, of course, become quite&#xD;
a necessity. That is al~vays desirable.&#xD;
"A few months ago, a beautiful young&#xD;
lady, throbbing with ambition, instead of&#xD;
love, married a man thrice her age, be-&#xD;
cause he was rich. She sported her dia-&#xD;
monds, exhibited her carriage, threw open&#xD;
a splendid dwelling to admiring friends.&#xD;
Yesterday he failed, and to-day she is a&#xD;
beggar. For a moment she was delighted,&#xD;
because her hopes fed on vanity. The&#xD;
food is withdrawn, and she is wedded not&#xD;
only to an old, but a poor man. There is&#xD;
a fatal error in the education of young&#xD;
ladies at the present day. The almost&#xD;

C-&#xD;
&#xD;
158                           CLIF&#xD;
,universal remark is~c She must not marry&#xD;
a person who cannot enable her to con-&#xD;
tinue in the sphere where she is now so&#xD;
bright an ornament.' Perhaps her father&#xD;
lives beyond his income, in supporting that&#xD;
very style which it is deemed so essential&#xD;
for his daughter's suitor to possess. If he&#xD;
'should die, the salary would be lost which&#xD;
keeps up the establishment, and the splen-&#xD;
did style would yield to oue more lonely.&#xD;
At his (leath, a diminished principal might&#xD;
be divided among those who had many&#xD;
opportunities of marrying happily. In&#xD;
order not to marry below their condition&#xD;
in life, they must often ally themselves to&#xD;
decrepitude, or enjoy a &amp;amp;ate of single&#xD;
blessedness. Who own the princely dwell-&#xD;
ings which adorn Fourteenth Street, Union&#xD;
Square, and Fifth Avenue ~ Men who&#xD;
have acquired fortunes themselves, by en-&#xD;
terprise and good sense. The next gene-&#xD;
ration often becomes effeminate, and in&#xD;
accepting the son, you contract a marriage&#xD;
with one who has neither the strength to&#xD;
defend, or the soul to appreciate you. If&#xD;
an alliance is formed with a rich bachelor,&#xD;
his settled habits and ascetic temper render&#xD;
him a perfect nuisance. Then, why not&#xD;
marty a fine-looking,:~n oble, generous&#xD;
young man, whose prospects are good, if&#xD;
you will, but whose manly heart recipro-&#xD;
cates the impulses of your own&#xD;
"But here I am giving a delineation of&#xD;
society, and lecturing my sex, when I only&#xD;
commenced describing a New Year's re-&#xD;
ception.&#xD;
"February, 1845.-I am still in New&#xD;
York, Florence was so anxious for me to&#xD;
remain until after her party. Night after&#xD;
night I have attended parties and the opera,&#xD;
until 1 am nearly exhausted. I discover&#xD;
every day new phases in society. A&#xD;
prominent feature is the determination with&#xD;
which the ambitious endeavour to enter&#xD;
circles more exclusive than their own. It&#xD;
is sometimes resisted by those who had&#xD;
quite as much difficulty in obtaining ad-&#xD;
mission themselves, but who forget their&#xD;
own struggles, in the hour of triumph.&#xD;
To be seen in the rooms of Mrs. A. or Miss&#xD;
B., is considered an important step up the&#xD;
ladder. Not that the guest is in the slightest&#xD;
degree more attractive, only she shines&#xD;
with a reflected light. There is a vast&#xD;
amount of stupidity exhibited in these&#xD;
reunions. Occasionally I meet a person&#xD;
who can emerge from the common-places&#xD;
of the day, and by her sparkling wit and&#xD;
vivacity, create a desire to see her again;&#xD;
but they are like oases in the desert-ex-&#xD;
ceedingly rare.&#xD;
"Certain cliques affect to be very ex-&#xD;
&#xD;
TO0N.&#xD;
&#xD;
elusive. What is the cause and effect of&#xD;
exclusiveness ~ The solution is readily&#xD;
given. A family having nothing but wealth&#xD;
out of which to manufacture notoriety, are&#xD;
resolved to make the most of their capital.&#xD;
They can boast of neither illustrious de-&#xD;
scent nor remarkable intelligence ;but they&#xD;
have money enough to keep up a hand-&#xD;
some establishment, and give occasionally&#xD;
an elegant party. It is desirable, in their&#xD;
estimation, to have a small circle of ac-&#xD;
quaintances, an admission to which is with&#xD;
difficulty obtained. The outsiders desig-&#xD;
nate them as a proud set. What of that '~&#xD;
Is it not exactly what 'they desire ~ They&#xD;
at once acquire notoriety; that is all they&#xD;
want. The more difficult the entr6e to their&#xD;
saloons is rendered, the more an obsequi-&#xD;
ous class of the community will seek for&#xD;
admission. Persons who understand the&#xD;
moderate attractions of these exclusives,&#xD;
smile at the skill with which they manage&#xD;
a limited mental capitaL&#xD;
"They argue thus :-If everybody can&#xD;
claim the acquaintance of a lady, the world&#xD;
will not consider her very I~shionable.&#xD;
Tom, Dick, and Harry are well enough in&#xD;
their place; they are neither decidedly&#xD;
fashionable, nor positively vulgar, but they&#xD;
are gentlemen whose acquaintance can&#xD;
never benefit you in the slightest degree.&#xD;
Well, this trio boast ofthe delightful party&#xD;
which they attended at Mrs. Smith's. All&#xD;
this does not assist Mr~. Smith in the accom-&#xD;
plishment of her ambitious aspirations.&#xD;
It is rather an obstacle, because their&#xD;
praises reach the ears of Mrs. Talbot, who&#xD;
immediately sets Mrs. Smith down as a&#xD;
nobody. If, on the contrary, Messrs. Tom,&#xD;
Dick, and Harry are not received at Mrs.&#xD;
Smith's, it is an evidence that that distin-&#xD;
guished lady holds herself quite above&#xD;
them. They will bc sure, nevertheless, to&#xD;
herald her party, because they like to have&#xD;
the names of distinguished people con-&#xD;
stantly on their lips. If, after performing&#xD;
the duty of avant couriers, they are asked,&#xD;
'Were y~u at the party 'P their negative&#xD;
reply will add to the social position of Mrs.&#xD;
Smith. The standing of a lady, though a&#xD;
stranger, may be as well known by the&#xD;
company she keeps, as though she was&#xD;
your intimate friend.&#xD;
"If I was ambitious of winning a fash-&#xD;
ionable position, I should most decidedly&#xD;
practise the exclusive system. It is&#xD;
preferable in every respect. In the first&#xD;
place, it is troublesome to know every-&#xD;
body! If you give a party, and do not&#xD;
invite them, they will declare that they&#xD;
were forced to cut you, and will assign&#xD;
a different reason for it.' They are always&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
C L I F T 0 N.&#xD;
&#xD;
certain to ~be in the way when they are&#xD;
not wanted. If you are conversing with a&#xD;
lady whose good opinion you are anxious&#xD;
to win, they are sure to obtrude themselves,&#xD;
with a warmth and cordiality which be-&#xD;
tokens the greatest intimacy, arid before&#xD;
you can shake them off, you read in the&#xD;
eyes of your fashionable acquaintance,&#xD;
'what a common-looking woman!'&#xD;
"In the next place, there would be no&#xD;
wall-flowers at your entertainments, to go&#xD;
away discontented, because they received&#xD;
no attention. In a mixed assembly, there&#xD;
will always be wall-flowers, because they&#xD;
are not acquainted with your set, and to&#xD;
'know po one renders a party exceedingly,&#xD;
stnpi(l.&#xD;
"There is another peculiar feature in&#xD;
New York society. The leaders of the&#xD;
ton consider their circle as the centre of&#xD;
the universe. Everything disconnected&#xD;
with it, is regarded as of secondary im-&#xD;
portance. They are irritated whenever&#xD;
the attention of their votaries is attracted&#xD;
to any outwar(l object. It must be ex-&#xD;
clusively turned to them and their affairs.&#xD;
Their parties, the entertainments given&#xD;
by their friends, their favourite artists,&#xD;
must exclnsively command your admira-&#xD;
tion. An event of general importance&#xD;
had become more than a nine days~ won-&#xD;
der; the public observation would not be&#xD;
diverted from it; it was the topic of con-&#xD;
versation in every circle. A lady, who&#xD;
believed her friends constituted the&#xD;
centre of fashionable society, but who had&#xD;
not sufficient mind or patience to grasp&#xD;
the subject which was eliciting the com-&#xD;
mnents of all, lost her teniper at the tenacity&#xD;
with which public observation was distract-&#xD;
ed from her narrow sphere, amid riveted&#xD;
upon a subject of world-wide renown. 'For&#xD;
heaven's sake !' she exclaimed, ' do not&#xD;
mention that subject; I ant tired to death&#xD;
of it.' She was egotistical, and it inter-&#xD;
fered with the revolution of that contracted&#xD;
sphere which constituted her little world.&#xD;
"Perhaps vanity which would exact&#xD;
incessant devotion, is not confined alto-&#xD;
gether to New York. I am a Phila-&#xD;
delphian, and I may not do the Manhat-&#xD;
tanese full justice. They might discover&#xD;
quite as many defects in the society of the&#xD;
rectangular city; although it will be ad-&#xD;
mitted, that New Yorkers have quite a&#xD;
moderate opinion of the suburban vil-&#xD;
lages.'&#xD;
"They have established a curious fash-&#xD;
ion in New York, which seems to be&#xD;
gaining votaries. The dresses are cut so&#xD;
long, that to walk the streets without soil-&#xD;
ing them, is n ext to impossible, especially&#xD;
&#xD;
159&#xD;
&#xD;
when the vulgar habit of smoking in the&#xD;
street is tolerated. Some of the ladies,&#xD;
therefore, think it necessary to elevate&#xD;
their skirts so as to avoid the filth upon&#xD;
the side-walks and crossings. This would&#xD;
all be very well if they wore pantaletts.&#xD;
Custom has established a rule that ladies&#xD;
(off the stage) shall wear a covering for&#xD;
their limbs. That rule is constantly&#xD;
evaded, especially by those females who&#xD;
are blessed with beautiful proportions.&#xD;
They seem to take an especial pleasure in&#xD;
promenading the streets after a rain or&#xD;
a snow, because it gives them an excuse&#xD;
for elevating their dresses: but it does not&#xD;
give them an excuse for doing so, unless&#xD;
their limbs are encased in something be-&#xD;
sides stockings. If a lady wears panta-&#xD;
letts, it is because, in three cases out of&#xD;
four, she has not been favoured by nature&#xD;
~vith model proportions. It is very seldom&#xD;
that skirts are elevated decidedly, above&#xD;
the pavement without the limbs being pro-&#xD;
tected from observation, unless they are&#xD;
round, swelling, and well formed.&#xD;
'~ It was only yesterday, as I was driv-&#xD;
ing down Broadway, with Miss Brainard,&#xD;
that I saw two young ladies walking upon&#xD;
the fashionable side, between Canal Street&#xD;
and Stuart's. As the way was obstructed&#xD;
by omnibuses, our carriage proceeded&#xD;
slowly. Both ladies were splendidly at-&#xD;
tired; their undergarments were fine and&#xD;
spotless. One of them had on drawers,&#xD;
which were fastened around the ankle,&#xD;
the other wore none; or if she did, they&#xD;
terminated above the knees. Several&#xD;
times she caught the impertinent gaze of&#xD;
gentlemen fixed upon her really beautiful&#xD;
legs. She may deny it, but I know she&#xD;
did. The skirts were not lowered the&#xD;
breadth of ~a hair. I was terribly&#xD;
mortified for her, especially when I dis-&#xD;
covered a knot of loafers following in her&#xD;
footsteps, making their vulgar remarks. I&#xD;
thought, who could she be? At last,&#xD;
turning her head, I saw it was a young&#xD;
lady to whom I had been introduced at a&#xD;
large and brilliant party. She recognized&#xD;
me, and bo~ved, but I was so much shock-&#xD;
ed at her want of modesty that I did not&#xD;
return it.&#xD;
"If they reply that their drawers some-&#xD;
times work up, I can only say that there&#xD;
is a way of fastening them around the&#xD;
ankle. It is very convenient, I know, to&#xD;
have them made so small that they will&#xD;
not fall to the instep; provided they are&#xD;
pulled up to the knees, where they will&#xD;
remain.&#xD;
"This fondness for making exhibitions&#xD;
can be traced, in a certain degree, to the&#xD;

dressing and training of children. If a&#xD;
little girl has handsome limbs, she is&#xD;
taught to exhibit them with pride. She is&#xD;
attired for that purpose. She learns to&#xD;
become vain of them, and the incipient&#xD;
vanity of childhood gains boldness from&#xD;
habit, until at length, as a woman, she&#xD;
walks the st nblushingly, with near-&#xD;

DRAKE.&#xD;
Ma. POLK had been inaugurated, and&#xD;
the executive power passed into his hands.&#xD;
Younger than either of his predecessors,&#xD;
his administration was destined to become&#xD;
more eventful than any one that had hith-&#xD;
erto illustrated the career of the American&#xD;
Confederation. His great knowledge of&#xD;
men enabled him to select a cabinet,&#xD;
whose extraordinary powers, and vast in-&#xD;
fluence, assisted hint in n~ inconsiderable&#xD;
degree, to perfect those measures which&#xD;
radically changed the foreign and domes-&#xD;
tic policy of the country. The Depart-&#xD;
rnent of State was entrusted to James&#xD;
Buchanan, who was the leading demo-&#xD;
crat in Pennsylvania, until the elevation&#xD;
of Mr. Dallas to the Vice-Presidency. The&#xD;
selection was a master-stroke of policy.&#xD;
Mr. Buchanan had long been an advocate&#xD;
of protection; even in the canvass of 1844,&#xD;
he was charged ~yith claiming Mr. Polk&#xD;
as quite as good a protectionist as Mr.&#xD;
Clay. By his transfer to the cabinet, from&#xD;
an open advocate of protection, he be-&#xD;
came, at first, a quasi supporter of a reve-&#xD;
nue tariff, and then one of its decided&#xD;
friends. He had one eye fixed upon the&#xD;
Presidency; it was therefore necessary for&#xD;
him to elevate his position above the&#xD;
contracted sphere of Pennsylvania, so as&#xD;
to command the attention of the whole&#xD;
&#xD;
Union. Thi~ could only be done by yield-&#xD;
ing to the current which threatened de-&#xD;
struction to the protective policy. It was&#xD;
a bitter pill for him to swallow. But what&#xD;
could he do ~ He was associated with a&#xD;
free~trade* cabinet! A resignation upon&#xD;
the ground that he still maintained his&#xD;
ancient faith, would array him in opposi-&#xD;
tion to the administration, and a large&#xD;
majority of the Democratic party. The&#xD;
sacrifice went to the extent of a total&#xD;
abandonment of his chances for the Presi-&#xD;
dency, for the purpose of retaining his&#xD;
local, and what might at last prove a tem-&#xD;
porary popularity. The influence of a&#xD;
name was given, therefore, to the free&#xD;
trade policy, which, under other circurn-&#xD;
stances, might have been arrayed against&#xD;
it. To be sure, it amounted to nothing&#xD;
in Pennsylvania, because the only mem-&#xD;
ber from that State, who voted for the&#xD;
tariff of 1846, was the personal enemy of&#xD;
the Secretary of State. But a formidable&#xD;
opponent was won over to the popular&#xD;
cause, and it remains to be seen, if&#xD;
State pride will not yet bring the Keystone&#xD;
State to the support of her favourite son,&#xD;
and the new faith which he has espoused.&#xD;
As the head of our foreign department,&#xD;
he maintained the honour of the United&#xD;
States with consummate ability. The&#xD;
policy which he LAndeviatingly advocated&#xD;
in the settlement of our difficulties with&#xD;
England and Mexico, was bold and in-&#xD;
flexible.&#xD;
Robert J. Walker was appointed Sec-&#xD;
retary of the Treasury. This statesman&#xD;
leads on the progressionists. He has far&#xD;
greater tact at discovering the current of&#xD;
public opinion, than aiiy of his cotempo-&#xD;
raries, while with unshaken boldness and&#xD;
fortitude, he gives direction to its course,&#xD;
without attempting to restrain its impulses.&#xD;
He relies with implicit'confidence upon&#xD;
the judgment of the people, and they have&#xD;
thus far sustained the measure of his be-&#xD;
lief. It was his letter 'advocating the an-&#xD;
nexation of Texas, which gave an uncon-&#xD;
trollable direction to the popular voice.&#xD;
It was his unanswerable arguments that&#xD;
contributed so much towards the estab-&#xD;
lishment of free trade between the United&#xD;
States and Great ritain.t&#xD;

were anxious that a member of General&#xD;
Jackson's cabinet, and a man of moderate&#xD;
capacity, should receive the appointment&#xD;
of Secretary of State. His calibre was&#xD;
not considered sufficiently weighty for that&#xD;
position, and having refused the post&#xD;
which he held under a previous adrninis-&#xD;
tration, it was tendered to Gov. Marcy.&#xD;
The Mexican war rendered the position&#xD;
one of great responsibility, and it was&#xD;
fortunate for President Polk, that he had&#xD;
secured the services of a statesman whose&#xD;
judgment and energy qualified him to&#xD;
tlischa~ge its responsible duties. George&#xD;
Bancroft was appointed Secretary of the&#xD;
Navy. Twice have individuals who had&#xD;
illustrated the pages of American litera-&#xD;
lure, p resided over the Navy Department,*&#xD;
and th e same honours should have been&#xD;
conferred upon another, whose experience&#xD;
in early life, qualified him for the dis-'&#xD;
charge of its duties&#xD;
The' Post Office was filled by one of the&#xD;
most celebrated economists and reformers&#xD;
in the House of Representatives, Cave&#xD;
Johnson of Tennessee. His mild arid&#xD;
courteous manners, his unwavering inte-&#xD;
grity, and his profound knowledge of the&#xD;
masses, rentlered him a safe and influen-&#xD;
tial cabinet councillor. John Y. Mason. a&#xD;
successful politician; and Messrs. Clifford&#xD;
of Maine, and Toucey of Connecticut,&#xD;
completed the cabinet of Mr. Polk.&#xD;
The President was scarcely installed in&#xD;
office, before he committed the fatal error&#xD;
of attempting to conciliate both factions&#xD;
in the Empire State. It is useless to dis-&#xD;
guise the fact, that a politician, to become&#xD;
successful, must adopt the motto of George&#xD;
the Fourth, and General Jackson~~(C I will&#xD;
adhere to my friends, and set my enemies&#xD;
at defiancee." Instead of standing by his&#xD;
undoubted adherents, he sought to disarm&#xD;
the secret hostility of the Van Buren men.&#xD;
The greater his concessions, the more un-&#xD;
manageable they became, until before the&#xD;
close of his administration, they were its&#xD;
fiercest ol)pOnents. His real supporters&#xD;
were taunted with the favors which were&#xD;
conferred upon their rivals, until believe&#xD;
themselves abandoned, they the ng&#xD;
left cabi-&#xD;
net to contend the best way they could&#xD;
with their remorseless assailants, until&#xD;
the President an(l his advisers dearly paid&#xD;
the penalty of their folly. At a later day,&#xD;
Mr. Fillmore is playing the same game,&#xD;
arid with consequences quite as disastrous.&#xD;
He gains no wisdom from the melancholy&#xD;
experience of his predecessor.&#xD;

It will be confessed by the political&#xD;
opponents of the late President, that he&#xD;
carried out the platform which he laid&#xD;
down in his inaugural address with an&#xD;
unyielding determination. There is but&#xD;
one solitary instance of his swerving from&#xD;
a position which he had assumed~, and&#xD;
that was in adjusting the boundaries of&#xD;
Oregon. He committed a fatal blunder in&#xD;
conducting the negotiations, which, having&#xD;
the effect of alienatinre his warmest friends,&#xD;
embarrassed his administration almost&#xD;
from its beginning to its close. In his&#xD;
first annual message to Congress, he as-&#xD;
serted that our title to the whole Oregon&#xD;
Territory had been maintained by irrefra-&#xD;
gable facts and arguments. In the discus-&#xD;
sion between Messrs. Buchanan and Pack-&#xD;
* enham, to which he referred, the Secre-&#xD;
tary of State insisted that the northern&#xD;
boundary of Oregon extended to the lati-&#xD;
tude of 540 40'. To this extent Mr. Polk&#xD;
claimed that our title was "clear and un-&#xD;
questionable.) His subsequent agreement&#xD;
to cede the territory between that line an(l&#xD;
the forty-ninth degree of north latitude&#xD;
was not only an unauthorized surrender&#xD;
of soil which was unquestionably our own,&#xD;
but violated a principle that had been&#xD;
solemnly announced by himself. In his&#xD;
first annual message he reiterated and&#xD;
endorsed the Monroe doctnir~e, that it is&#xD;
the unchangeable policy of the United&#xD;
States to prevent European powers from&#xD;
colonizing any portion of this continent.&#xD;
If we will not permit them to colonize&#xD;
territory which (loes not beloiig to us, how&#xD;
can we surrender our own domain for that&#xD;
purpose ~&#xD;
This palpable inconsistency offended the&#xD;
Western democracy. and enabled the oppo-&#xD;
sition members of Congress to charge Mr.&#xD;
Polk with separating the two great ques-&#xD;
tions which were in issue before the people&#xD;
-Texas and Oregon ,.-for the purpose of&#xD;
aggrandizing the South at the expense of&#xD;
the North. It will always remain a ble-&#xD;
mish upon the splendid administration of&#xD;
Mr. Polk, that he surrendered nearly&#xD;
200,000,000 acres of land, to gratify the&#xD;
rapacity of that power, which exhibits a&#xD;
remorseless thirst for dominion.&#xD;
In the midst of clamour, he miscouceiv-&#xD;
ed alike the wishes of his constituents and&#xD;
the foreign policy of the British govern-&#xD;
rnent. He was appalled by the cry of&#xD;
War! which was raised at the capital. He&#xD;
ought to have known that the opinions of&#xD;
those who surrounded him did not reflect&#xD;
the popular sentiment. A thousand ex-&#xD;
traneous influences are mingled with the&#xD;
political atmosphere of the metropolis&#xD;

&#xD;
The foreign diplomatic corps exercise a&#xD;
far greater power than many suppose.&#xD;
They'give elegant parties, receptions, and&#xD;
suppers. They are 'hail, fellows, well met,'&#xD;
with radicals and federalists, and by the&#xD;
urbanity of their manners they acquire a&#xD;
very considerable influence. They ply&#xD;
members with doubts; they are ever&#xD;
watchful and vigilant, and seek every&#xD;
opportunity to instil their opinions. But&#xD;
the great public heart is not contaminated&#xD;
by the poison. Nothing interposes be-&#xD;
tween its pulsations and national honour.&#xD;
Its vast might is not fettered by the cob-&#xD;
webs of diplomacy, and its strong right&#xD;
arm is ready to strike, regardless of the&#xD;
consequences. Politicians do not rely&#xD;
enough upon the judgment and patriotism&#xD;
of the people. Few men trusted them&#xD;
so implicitly as General Jackson, and&#xD;
with such triumphant success. How&#xD;
many instances does our brief history&#xD;
afford of politicians being swept from&#xD;
office by an indignant people, when they&#xD;
had vainly thought that they had suc-&#xD;
ceeded in hoodwinking them, by tricl~ery&#xD;
and deceit.&#xD;
Mr. Polk's political vision was obscured&#xD;
by the mist which the foreign diplomatic&#xD;
corps had raised, and he could not disco-&#xD;
ver the movements of the masses. A&#xD;
skilful statesman will watch the distant&#xD;
breakers, as well as the undertow; if he&#xD;
does not his bark will be wrecked while&#xD;
he is throwing the lead at her bow.&#xD;
The executive also misunderstood the&#xD;
condition of the British Empire. Its saga-&#xD;
cious rulers could threaten, because that&#xD;
cost neither money nor blood. But they&#xD;
were in no condition to fight. They were&#xD;
under bonds to keep the peace sufficiently&#xD;
large to bankrupt the empire, if they were&#xD;
forfeited. Famine was staring Ireland in&#xD;
the face, and if the supply of food and&#xD;
cotton had been arrested, a starving popu-&#xD;
lation would threaten destruction to' here-&#xD;
ditary institutions and social order. These&#xD;
things Mr. Polk ought to have known; not&#xD;
that we would claim unjust demands from&#xD;
weakness, any more than we should aban-&#xD;
don our rights when menaced by the&#xD;
strong. We ought, at least, to avoid being&#xD;
frightened at our own shadows.&#xD;
With the exception of the Oregon con-&#xD;
troversy, the career of Mr. Polk was bril-&#xD;
liant and successful. There were inci-&#xD;
dents, it is true, which his friends regret-&#xD;
ted, but they consisted principally of ap-&#xD;
pointments to office., They were tempo-&#xD;
rary, and will soon be forgotten, while&#xD;
that splendid superstructure which was&#xD;
erected by Mr. Polk and the democratic&#xD;
&#xD;
party will long remain the admiration of&#xD;
posterity.&#xD;

she gave our hero a glance into the depths&#xD;
of her beautiful eyes that would have&#xD;
shaken the resolution of one still more im-&#xD;
passive.&#xD;
The eventful day had passed, and the&#xD;
&#xD;
noble steamer was descending a tributary&#xD;
of the Mississippi. The air was clear&#xD;
and bracing, for the country still present-&#xD;
ed the appearance of winter. Patches of&#xD;
snow could be seen, where the genial&#xD;
rays of the sun had not fallen upon it,&#xD;
and nothing but the leafless trees and na-&#xD;
ked shrubs were left of that munificent&#xD;
vegetation, which ornaments the shores of&#xD;
our Southern rivers.&#xD;
There were few passengers save the&#xD;
wedding cortege, and the splendid cabin&#xD;
was the scene of gayety and mirth. A&#xD;
band of musicians had been engaged, and&#xD;
the waltz and polka; cards, music. and&#xD;
conversation served to occupy the revellers&#xD;
as the pointed keel of the Randolph&#xD;
ploughed the bosom of the stream.&#xD;
Traveling upon the Western waters-&#xD;
bating the danger of fire and explosions-&#xD;
is always delightful. The table is loaded&#xD;
with every delicacy. and the ever-varying&#xD;
scenery upon the banks elicits the admira-&#xD;
tion of the wayfarer. The river-bottoms--&#xD;
which invariably spread out on one or&#xD;
both sides of the stream, to the adjacent&#xD;
hills-in their primitive state are covered&#xD;
with a growth of large forest trees. The&#xD;
soil, having been made by the river, and&#xD;
the draining of the upland~is inexhaus-&#xD;
tibly rich. Here and there the industry of&#xD;
the settler is manifested, but by far the&#xD;
greater portion of the bottoms are still&#xD;
held in possession by those lofty trees,&#xD;
whose forms have for . ages braved the&#xD;
lightning and the storm. There is a con-&#xD;
trast, too in the openings which relieve&#xD;
the solitude. Here the stuinpless earth,&#xD;
elegant mansion, and spacious outbuild-&#xD;
ings, prove that the native wilds have long&#xD;
since yielded to the dominion of its relent-&#xD;
less foe. Anon, the eyes rest upon a log&#xD;
cabin with its bark roof wood and mortar&#xD;
chimney, lowly entrance, arid humble&#xD;
furniture. But the resounding axe, and&#xD;
levelled forest is opening a path to wealth&#xD;
arid luxury.&#xD;
Want is unknown, and the necessaries&#xD;
of life abound in that land of plenty.&#xD;
Flat-boats are often seen along the&#xD;
shore filled with wood for the steamers.&#xD;
They rest quietly upon the water, until&#xD;
the waves which are rolled away from&#xD;
the rushing keel come hurtling against the&#xD;
inert mass. For a moment it is fiercely&#xD;
rocked, arid then, as the waves subside, it&#xD;
again sluggishly hugs the shore. Occa-&#xD;
s~onally the Randolph stopped at a village&#xD;
to land or take in passengers, but the&#xD;
stern voice of Captain Joe Miller was soon&#xD;
heard from the hurricane deck, exclaim-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing, "Take in the plank !" and the float-&#xD;
ing palace again swept down the current.&#xD;
"Come, ladies, let us play eucher! We&#xD;
have tried whist long enough. How it is&#xD;
possible that you can be so fond of whist,&#xD;
I cannot tell. It requires us to use all the&#xD;
cards, and exhausts all the patience I can&#xD;
command. 1 play for amusement, and&#xD;
not to make my head ache watching the&#xD;
progress of the gam~e.~~&#xD;
"You must not let it be known that&#xD;
your patience is so easily disposed of, Mrs.&#xD;
Fielding."&#xD;
"Call me Helen, Mr. Clifton; it is so&#xD;
formal to prefix the Mrs. to my name."&#xD;
"Certainly, if you will permit me."&#xD;
"Yes, I will allow ~on that privilege.&#xD;
Come, Mrs. Broughton, you and Mr. Har-&#xD;

others will weary their heads with that&#xD;
stupid game. Let us beat the gentlenien&#xD;
a few hands."&#xD;
"What a wonderful favourite eucher&#xD;
has become within the last few years,"&#xD;
observed Harden.&#xD;
"Because it is a social game, and&#xD;
scarcely interrupts the conversation."&#xD;
"That accounts for its popularity with&#xD;
the ladies," said Judge Douglass.&#xD;
"What an imputation, papa. As for&#xD;
myself, I think the gentlemen make quite&#xD;
as goo(l use of their tongues as we do."&#xD;
"I do not know when it is. To my&#xD;
mind, nothing can equal a dozen women&#xD;
assembled in the same parlour. There are&#xD;
positively no listeners, and twelve distinct&#xD;
voices are heard at the same time. I once&#xD;
knew a lawyer who always managed to&#xD;
rid himself of a taciturn visitor, by respond-&#xD;
ing in monosyllables. Egad, he would&#xD;
have been excessively popular with the&#xD;
ladies, Helen. A good listener is all they&#xD;
require."&#xD;
"Our sex are quite as often flattered by&#xD;
the seeming deference of a good listener,"&#xD;
observed Clifton. "The most ignorant&#xD;
attribute your courteous attention to re-&#xD;
marks, which, judging from their effects,&#xD;
they think speak volumes of wisdom,&#xD;
when you knoxv they utter the most stupid&#xD;
nonsense. All you have to do, is to bow&#xD;
and smile occasionally yand they will leave&#xD;
your presence, not only well satisfied with&#xD;
themselves, but firmly convinced that you&#xD;
are the most intelligent person they have&#xD;
ever known. If, on the contrary, you&#xD;
exhibit, by a word or a look, the contempt&#xD;
which you must feel for their insufferable&#xD;
vanity, if not for their ignorance, you&#xD;
make enemies of them for life."&#xD;
"There, papa-what do you think of&#xD;
that?"&#xD;

"And his looks, like the face of the owl,&#xD;
speak volumes of thought."&#xD;
"That is your comparison, Mrs. Brough-&#xD;
~Ofl*~~&#xD;
"Of course; a politician must disclaim all&#xD;
unpopular allusions to the (lear people."&#xD;
"What is the matter, Davidson r' in-&#xD;
quired Fielding, as the former hastily de-&#xD;
scended from the hurricane deck.&#xD;
"The Ellen Kirkman i~ rounding the&#xD;
point, which we passed a moment ago~&#xD;
and a trial of speed will take place be~&#xD;
tween the two rivals."&#xD;
"What, a race ~" said Mrs. Broughton,&#xD;
as her cheek became pallid.&#xD;
She had witnessed an explosion from&#xD;
the generation of too much steam, scarcely&#xD;
one year before.&#xD;
"Oh, let's witness it !" joyfully ex-&#xD;
claimed Emy. "Come for your ~&#xD;
and she bounded away, but soon reap-&#xD;
peared, attired for a promenade upon the&#xD;
deck, where they all soon congregated.&#xD;
"Which is the fastest boat ~" asked&#xD;
Judge Douglass.&#xD;
"That has never been tested," rejoined&#xD;
Capt. Miller. "The Randolph has for&#xD;
years been without a rival upon the'&#xD;
Western waters. The Kirkman is a new&#xD;
boat, and is said to be unequalled for&#xD;
speed. This is the first time they have&#xD;
encountered, and the trial can be no longer&#xD;
postponed. Fire up, men&#xD;
The dry hickory and oak speedily disap-&#xD;
peared in the grate, and the enormous en-&#xD;
gines groaned, as they rapidly moved the&#xD;
machinery. The firemen and deck hands&#xD;
were all negroes, and they enlivened their&#xD;
toil with the music of the river songs.&#xD;
"We have one hundred miles to run&#xD;
before we reach another port, so the test&#xD;
will be a fair one," cried Captain Joe, as&#xD;
he calmly watched the progress of the&#xD;
two boats, as they rudely parted the smooth&#xD;
current of the river. The forest and sur-&#xD;
rounding rocks prolonged the echoes of&#xD;
the steam, as it harshly burst from the&#xD;
"'scape pipes." The double engines of&#xD;
the Ellen Kirkman were forcing her keel&#xD;
through the water at a tremendous rate of&#xD;
speed, and the anxious spectators, who&#xD;
&#xD;
occupied the hurricane deck of the Ran-&#xD;
dolph, saw the space bet~veen the two&#xD;
rapidly diminish.&#xD;
"Ah, ha!" shouted Capt. Miller, "they&#xD;
are burning tar ~ and black columns of&#xD;
smoke rolled from the chimneys of the&#xD;
approaching steamer.&#xD;
The passengers were now thoroughly&#xD;
excited, and even Mrs. Broughton lost nil&#xD;
apprehensions in the general enthusiasm.&#xD;
"Why do you not also burn tar ~" in-&#xD;
quired Mrs. Fielding.&#xD;
"Consideration for my passengers, as&#xD;
well as for the boat, a lone prevents me,"&#xD;
was the sententious reply.&#xD;
"Never fear for us; do not submit to the&#xD;
disgrace of being passed."&#xD;
The captain hesitated a moment, and&#xD;
cast his eyes again at the Kirkman. It&#xD;
was now evident that more steam must be&#xD;
generated, or the Randolph could no longer&#xD;
boast of being the fastest steamer in the&#xD;
world. A frown gathered upon the stern&#xD;
countenance of 'the commander, as he&#xD;
muttered-&#xD;
"It is a violation of my regulations, but&#xD;
there is no help for it. Men, bring out&#xD;
half-a-dozen barrels of turpentine."&#xD;
A loud cheer from the lover deck, ex-&#xD;
pressed the delight of the, crew. The&#xD;
barrels were soon ranged along the grates;&#xD;
the heads were burst open, and the wood&#xD;
was dipped into the inflammable liquid.&#xD;
The effect was almost instantaneous. The&#xD;
vast fabric darted onward with aA angry&#xD;
snort, and the space between the strug-&#xD;
gling, but uncortscious competitors, was&#xD;
increased. Another wild cheer rose from&#xD;
the deck, and this time it mingled with&#xD;
one which burst from the excited passen-&#xD;
gers. In the moment of enthusiasm, they&#xD;
were unconscious of being threatened&#xD;
by an instantaneous and horrible death.&#xD;
Nothing but the uncertain, yet hitherto&#xD;
iron power of the boilers, was interposed&#xD;
between them and eternity. They had&#xD;
never been so tested before, arid a point&#xD;
becoming weakened by the action of fire,&#xD;
might yield to the overwhelming power of&#xD;
steam, and shiver the boat into fragments.&#xD;
Every timber was shaken by the rapid&#xD;
motion of the engine, as it hurled the en-&#xD;
ormous mass over the ~vater. The sun&#xD;
had gone down, and the curtain of night&#xD;
fell upon the scene. Still, barrel after barrel&#xD;
of turpentine disappeared in the fiery&#xD;
grate. The dinner bell summoned the&#xD;
passengers in vain; they had forgotten all&#xD;
else in the excitement of the race. The&#xD;
fires on board the Rirkman now gleamed&#xD;
with a fearful brightness through the&#xD;
gloom, and appeared like two glittering&#xD;
&#xD;
orbs pursuing the flying steamer, with&#xD;
the relentless perseverance of fatality. The&#xD;
channel, for the last twenty miles, was&#xD;
broad, and extended nearly in a southern&#xD;
direction. It now contracted to a narrow&#xD;
space, and the river wound its serpentine&#xD;
course through the hills. Onward moved&#xD;
those floating palaces; the one following&#xD;
in the wake of the other. Every foot of&#xD;
the way was familiar to the pilots, and the&#xD;
obedient vessels curved along the narrow&#xD;
channel without any abatement of their&#xD;
speed. Upon the deck all was energy&#xD;
and activity. The dark faces of the sable&#xD;
workmen glistened in the light of the&#xD;
blazing fires, as the sweat streamed from&#xD;
their foreheads. The scene resembled the&#xD;
dominions of Vulcan, when the fabled&#xD;
god presides over his forges.&#xD;
The river now widened again, and the&#xD;
prow of the Kirkman was turned directly&#xD;
for a point about one mile ahead, while&#xD;
the Randolph was forced to keep the main&#xD;
channel.&#xD;
"By heavens! pilot, she will cut us off!"&#xD;
"There is a greater prospect of her&#xD;
grounding, Capt. Miller," was the prompt&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"Do you think so ~ If she does, at that&#xD;
rate of speed, she will become a total&#xD;
wreck."&#xD;
"They are checking her speed.~~&#xD;
"No, they are not. She does not draw~&#xD;
so much water as the Randolph, and be-&#xD;
sides, she is not so heavily loaded; still it&#xD;
seems almost incredible that her com-&#xD;
man~ler attempts that passage !"&#xD;
All eyes were directed to the Xirkman,&#xD;
as her broadside was disclosed to view.&#xD;
Every window, above and below, seemed&#xD;
to be illuminated, and the lights danced&#xD;
merrily upon the curving waves. The&#xD;
Kirkman was slowly gaining upon the&#xD;
Randolph, when a tremendous cheer burst&#xD;
from her decks. The waving handker-&#xD;
chiefs of her lady passengers could be seen,&#xD;
as they joined in the universal exultation.&#xD;
"You are shouting before you are out&#xD;
of the woods !" muttered the deep voice of&#xD;
Captain Joe.&#xD;
"Can you not increase your speed,&#xD;
Captain Miller ~" eagerly inquired Dr.&#xD;
Fielding.&#xD;
"impossible! both boats are going at&#xD;
the top of their speed. The safety-valve&#xD;
is fastened down, and there is imminent&#xD;
danger of an explosion.~&#xD;
Intelligence which, at another moment,&#xD;
would have blanched the cheek of the&#xD;
most reckless, now passed unnoticed by&#xD;
the most timid of that little circle.&#xD;
The Ellen Kirkman had passed over the&#xD;
&#xD;
shoals as though under the influence of&#xD;
magic, and she now headed for the main&#xD;
channel, with the intention of cutting off&#xD;
the Randolph. This movement violated&#xD;
the regulations of the river, as one boat&#xD;
could riot cross the bow of another un-&#xD;
less she had passed her. The Kirkman,&#xD;
on the contrary, was pursuing a direc-&#xD;
tion which would inevitably bring her bow&#xD;
in- contact with the wheel-house of her&#xD;
rival, unless the latter s~verved from her&#xD;
course. In a moment all was confusion&#xD;
on board the Randolph, when the loud&#xD;
and authoritative voice of the Captain&#xD;
was heard above the din, as he warned&#xD;
the pilot of the Kirkmari to keep away.&#xD;
The hands of both teamerss abandoned&#xD;
their work, and watched with awe-stricken&#xD;
countenances the approaching masses.&#xD;
The excitement upon the hurricane-deck&#xD;
was changed to dismay, and the aifrighted&#xD;
females retreated to the stern of the boat.&#xD;
Still the Kirkman bore down upoa her&#xD;
rival, as if determined to sink het.&#xD;
At this moment a loud voice issued&#xD;
from the lower deck of the Randolph,&#xD;
commanding the pilot of the other to bear&#xD;
away. A shout of defiance was the only&#xD;
reply, and it was scarcely uttered whea&#xD;
the report of a rifle echoed through the&#xD;
forest, and the fatal messenger of death&#xD;
pierced the bosom of the reckless pilot.&#xD;
For a minute, during which time a breath-&#xD;
less pause was maintained by the startled&#xD;
spectators, no one grasped the helm. The&#xD;
Kirkman was not more than forty yards&#xD;
distant from the Randolph, and was ra-&#xD;
pidly approaching, when her forward&#xD;
decks were riven, as if by a thunderbolt.&#xD;
The explosion was terrific; the fated boat&#xD;
trembled in every joint, aiid the scattered&#xD;
fragments covered the bosom of the stream.&#xD;
The mangled bodies f many of the crew&#xD;
were swept overboard; som clung with&#xD;
desperation to the wreck. Sev ral of the&#xD;
passengers had shared the s horrible&#xD;
fate, while the rest, having treated to&#xD;
the rear of the boat, were saved from&#xD;
destruction.&#xD;
All rivalry in a moment ceased. The&#xD;
engines of the Randolph were reversed,&#xD;
and she slowly swung round until, with&#xD;
great difficulty, she was lashed to the Kirk-&#xD;
man. Now commenced the workof search-&#xD;
ing for the wounded and the dead. No&#xD;
one who has never witnessed the effects&#xD;
of aii explosion, can at all appreciate its&#xD;
horrors. its parallel is never seen upon&#xD;
the battle-field. Limbs may be torn from&#xD;
the quivering bodies, and brainless skulls&#xD;
may lie at y our feet, but the intense agony&#xD;
of a scalded frame is indescribably awful.&#xD;

&#xD;
The skin was blown, by the rushing steam,&#xD;
entirely from the ebon face and chest of&#xD;
one poor negro, so that he looked like a&#xD;
bright mulatto. Many were thrown over-&#xD;
board by the explosion. These sufferers&#xD;
were most of them secured while they ut-&#xD;
tered the most appalling shrieks, and al-&#xD;
though shivering with cold, implored their&#xD;
delivererss, in tones that pierced their&#xD;
hearts, to put their burning limbs again in&#xD;
water.&#xD;
"Is it riot terrible ~ whispered Helen,&#xD;
as she assisted with trembling hands in&#xD;
the work of mercy. Never did those&#xD;
beautiful brides present such an angelic&#xD;
appearance, as when they ministered with&#xD;
so much tenderness and devotion to the&#xD;
relief of the sufferers.&#xD;
Slowly the wreck was towed into the&#xD;
next port, and the Randolph again headed&#xD;
down the stream.&#xD;
When the passengers awoke the next&#xD;
morning, the steamer was ploughing the&#xD;
current of the Mississippi. A feeling of&#xD;
awe steals across the mind of him who&#xD;
looks for the first time upon its broad sur-&#xD;
face, and recollects that within its banks&#xD;
are the contributions of its innumerable&#xD;
and mighty tributaries. The nil which&#xD;
modestly hides its crystal drops in the&#xD;
shade of some far-off grove, abandons its&#xD;
home amid the flowers, and borne along&#xD;
by a resistless fate, mingles with the flood,&#xD;
and loses its sweetness at last in the un-&#xD;
' changeable bitterness of the ocean.&#xD;
"When you look at the commerce&#xD;
which floats upon this river and its branch-&#xD;
es, Judge Douglass, how can you doubt&#xD;
that it was wisdom which dictated the&#xD;
purchase of Louisiana ?"&#xD;
"I have never denied but that the ac-&#xD;
quisition was an important one, Mr. Har-&#xD;
den. The extension of our boundaries&#xD;
m~y sometimes become important. I&#xD;
only contend that an indiscriminate and&#xD;
remorseless desire for more territory will&#xD;
ultimately involve us in foreign if not do-&#xD;
mestic wars."&#xD;
"But it is the policy of all tl~e principal&#xD;
powers to acquire contiguous territory."&#xD;
"I know it is. There is this striking&#xD;
difference, though. Their possessions are&#xD;
won by the sword, and maintained by&#xD;
force. Here, the citizen yields obedience&#xD;
to the Constitution under the impulse of&#xD;
morality and public opinion. The rule of&#xD;
action in a country where the sovereign&#xD;
exercises power by 'divine right,' and a&#xD;
republic where all authority is delegated&#xD;
by the people, is beyon~l comparison."&#xD;
"Your objection only applies to the in-&#xD;
corporation of territory whose inhabitants&#xD;
&#xD;
are opposed to annexation, and does not&#xD;
exclude those who are anxious for admis-&#xD;
sion within the pale of the union. Even&#xD;
that rule I think is altogether too limited.&#xD;
The interests of our country may require&#xD;
the forcible acquisition of territory, and&#xD;
the river upon whose waters we are now&#xD;
floating might have rendered the violation&#xD;
of your policy absolutely necessary. Sup-&#xD;
pose France had pertinaciously refused to&#xD;
transfer her title; as she undoubtedly&#xD;
would if the continental views of Napoleon&#xD;
had not absorbed his attention. Do you&#xD;
pretend to say that the vast commerce of&#xD;
the Upper Mississippi and its tributaries&#xD;
should remain under the control of another&#xD;
power i"&#xD;
"No; the doctrine of self-preservation,&#xD;
which applies to nations as well as to in-&#xD;
dividuals, would justify the forcible acqui-&#xD;
sition of the Mississippi, from its mouth to&#xD;
its ~&#xD;
"Well, then, you concede the argument&#xD;
in its length and breadth."&#xD;
"By no means. Another case cannot&#xD;
be mentioned where the material interests&#xD;
of the country would be so much affected,&#xD;
as the possession of New Orleans by the&#xD;
French."&#xD;
"Perhaps not. Still, there are other&#xD;
methods of annoying the commerce of the&#xD;
country, besides the possession of a fort at&#xD;
the mouth of the Mississippi. Adjacent&#xD;
harbours, where a fleet can hover, ready,&#xD;
at any moment, to capture our merchant-&#xD;
men and attack our men of tvar, should&#xD;
be kept under our own control. Such&#xD;
places are numerous along the shores of&#xD;
Texas. Even in the hands of a rival re-&#xD;
public, they might occasion much incon-&#xD;
venience. But suppose, in the course of&#xD;
events, they should pass under the control&#xD;
of England, what a source of annoyance&#xD;
they would become! Great Britain has&#xD;
scarcely a resting-place for her fleets, from&#xD;
Halifax to the Isthmus of Darien. Her&#xD;
statesmen would not hesitate to avail them-&#xD;
selves of almost any pretext to seize a&#xD;
harbour situated in a healthy climate,&#xD;
where, with their present navy, they could&#xD;
for years command the Gulf of Mexico.&#xD;
By the annexation of Texas we have, at&#xD;
all events, removed that difficulty from our&#xD;
path."&#xD;
"Well, now you have acquired Texas,&#xD;
I suppose you are satisfied ?"&#xD;
"By no means. As our territory ex-&#xD;
pands, it will create a necessity for the ac-&#xD;
quisition of new barriers for its protec-&#xD;
hon."&#xD;
"Why, what do you propose to swallow&#xD;
next 'i"&#xD;
&#xD;
C LI FTO0N.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Alta California."&#xD;
"You surely (10 not want to stride across&#xD;
the Rocky Mountains I"&#xD;
"Undoubtedly. That the eyes of our&#xD;
population are turned in that direction is&#xD;
proved by making the settlement of the&#xD;
Oregon boundary an issue in the last can-&#xD;
vass. But we want ports further south&#xD;
than Oregon. If the English offer to ac-&#xD;
cept the line of 49 as the boundary, giving&#xD;
them the whole of Vancouver's Island,&#xD;
will our government refuse l If not, the&#xD;
harbour of Puget's Sound is the only one&#xD;
which we possess upon the Pacific, and&#xD;
the entrance to that, through the straits of&#xD;
Fuca, will be commanded by a British&#xD;
battery upon the southern point of Van-&#xD;
couver's Island. It is folly to suppose that&#xD;
the commerce of the East will, for a long&#xD;
period, either double the Cape of Good&#xD;
Hope, or the southern point of South&#xD;
America. It will force a transit through&#xD;
San Francisco. The power of Mexico is&#xD;
too feeble to hold possession of California.&#xD;
It must come under the dominion of England&#xD;
or the United States. Interest demands its&#xD;
acquisition by us."&#xD;
"What pretext can be offered for seiz-&#xD;
ing California V'&#xD;
"I have reasons for believing that the&#xD;
new administration will force a settlement&#xD;
of Amerh~an claims upon Mexico. It will&#xD;
be resisted, and it is within the limits of&#xD;
probability that a war will ensue. At all&#xD;
events, instructions will be sent in a few&#xD;
weeks to Commodore Sloat to seize Cali-&#xD;
forum in case of a rupture.~~&#xD;
"With the intention of retaining itl'~&#xD;
"Well, you are a cormorant! Nothing&#xD;
will satisfy your rapacious appetite. But,&#xD;
my dear sir, in this insatiable thirst for&#xD;
empire you forget that there is danger of&#xD;
our becoming so unwieldy that we will&#xD;
break with our own xveight~"&#xD;
"There is not the slightest danger of it.&#xD;
The population which is admitted into the&#xD;
Union will not resist annexation. Any&#xD;
government is preferable to their own,&#xD;
and they will gladly become citizens of&#xD;
the great Republic !"&#xD;
"Over what people wduld you cast the&#xD;
protection of the stars and stripes ~&#xD;
"I ~vould annex the whole of North&#xD;
America."&#xD;
"Ha! ha! You have chosen a liberal&#xD;
margin. What will Great Britain say to&#xD;
your arrangement ~&#xD;
"Nothing. Her British possessions are&#xD;
more expensive than profitable, and she&#xD;
would willingly rid herself of them to-mor-&#xD;
row, upon fair terms. If the Imperial go-&#xD;
&#xD;
167&#xD;
&#xD;
vernment is, on the contrary, disposed to&#xD;
be contumackvus, there will simply be art&#xD;
abridged edition of the revolutionary&#xD;
struggle."&#xD;
"In which Brother Jonathan will take&#xD;
part, I suppose."&#xD;
"Individually, if not collectively. Our&#xD;
sympathies will always be in favour of&#xD;
republicanism.~~&#xD;
"Do you imagine that a majority of&#xD;
the Canadians would advocate annexa-&#xD;
tionl"&#xD;
"I have not a doubt ,of it, if it could be&#xD;
accomplished pe r~ceably. Their burdens&#xD;
are not so heavy m~s to force them, at this&#xD;
time, into a blood jr revolution. But when&#xD;
the mother country&amp;amp; , ceasing to treat theta&#xD;
so tenderly, appl~4 s the screws, they will&#xD;
speedily revolt."4~&#xD;
"But the       Canadians are unlet-&#xD;
tered, and would scarcely make better&#xD;
republicans than the inhabitants of old&#xD;
France."&#xD;
"That is true; but unlike the European&#xD;
French, they would constitute but a small&#xD;
segment of the population. Their igno-&#xD;
rance instead of becoming more profound&#xD;
by feeding upon itself, would fade before&#xD;
the progress of universal education."&#xD;
"And the Mexicans; you would annex&#xD;
them too, with all their vices, and fond-&#xD;
ness for revolutions. Since the revolt of&#xD;
Hidalgo, I believe two successive years&#xD;
have not elapsed without a bloody insur-&#xD;
rection. They would become beautiful&#xD;
republicans, truly !"&#xD;
"Oh, I do not propose to swallow the&#xD;
eight millions at once. They must be&#xD;
taken in small doses. The Americans&#xD;
~vill soon spread themselves over the pro-&#xD;
vince which is annexed, and by inculcat-&#xD;
ing the principles of free government, and&#xD;
intermarrying with the native population,&#xD;
they will soon be qualified to claim the&#xD;
elective franchise. Besides, if it should,&#xD;
for a time, require garrisons to make them&#xD;
yield obedience to the laws, we shall&#xD;
have to use no more vigilance than is&#xD;
necessary to keep the Indian tribes in sub-&#xD;
jection. You might as well contend that&#xD;
our Western forests should be surrendered&#xD;
to the roaming savages, because it requires&#xD;
an armed force to maintain the supremacy&#xD;
of the whites, as to insist that territory&#xD;
should not be acquired when a portion of&#xD;
the population are disorderly."&#xD;
"Your words are quite too mild, Mr. Har-&#xD;
den. You should say ~&#xD;
"Very well, aliens, if you will; but not&#xD;
like the original owners of this vast&#xD;
domain, aliens f6~r all time. The Mexi-&#xD;
can, with all his Spanish obstinacy, will&#xD;

at last yield to circumstances. The Indian&#xD;
will never bow his haughty head to the&#xD;
conqueror. The men of property cannot&#xD;
fail, in a short time, to discover that sta-&#xD;
bility and permanence are far preferable&#xD;
to anarchy and misrule-; they will, there-&#xD;
fore, gladly hail the change."&#xD;
"But there is one insurmountable ob-&#xD;
jection to your stupendous plan."&#xD;
"I should like to hear it."&#xD;
"It is the impossibility of making ge-&#xD;
neral laws, which will not weigh oppres-&#xD;
sively upon some portion of the empire.&#xD;
EveA now. when our territory does not&#xD;
cross half the degrees of latitude from the&#xD;
Northern Ocean to the Isthmus of Darien,&#xD;
sectional animosity threatens destruction&#xD;
to the Union. Armed resistance to the&#xD;
tariff of 1828, was alone prevented by the&#xD;
influence of General Jackson, and the&#xD;
passage of the Compromise Act. How can&#xD;
you graduate a revenue law that will not&#xD;
elicit complaints from the Southern planter,&#xD;
or the Northern manufacturer'? How can&#xD;
you frame an act, that will give satisfac-&#xD;
tion to the countless interests which are&#xD;
presented, within each degree of latitude,&#xD;
from the ice-bound regions of the North,&#xD;
to the unhealthy savannahs of the torrid&#xD;
zone'?~'&#xD;
"Your insurmountable objection, not-&#xD;
withstanding it is often urged, amounts to&#xD;
just nothing at all. What is there in the&#xD;
wants of Canada, to make a tariff more&#xD;
onerous upon the South'? and what is there&#xD;
in the fruits of Mexican labour, to cause&#xD;
Northern men to oppose annexation'? A&#xD;
more extensive market will certainly be&#xD;
acquired for Northern manufacturers '?~)&#xD;
"True, but where is the additional reve-&#xD;
nue to come from, which will be required'?&#xD;
From the Sonth~ of course. The North&#xD;
will dance, while the South pays the fid-&#xD;
dler. as usual."&#xD;
"Very well; and will not the South have&#xD;
a larger population to help pay the fiddler'?&#xD;
The burden cannot be greater than it is&#xD;
now. Besides, Judge, it does not come&#xD;
with a good grace from you, to urge that&#xD;
objection. Recollect, your party advocate&#xD;
a tariff discriminating for protection instead&#xD;
of revenue. However, I have another un-&#xD;
answerable reply to your argument.&#xD;
Abolish all tariffs and substitute direct&#xD;
taxation, as a method of raising revenue;&#xD;
then you may annex the xv ole continent&#xD;
if you will."&#xD;
Mrs. Harden, listened to ~his conversa-&#xD;
tion with much interest. Leaning forward&#xD;
with her head resting upon h~r hand, while&#xD;
the luxuriant hair was thrown back from&#xD;
the temple, she was the picture of earnest&#xD;
&#xD;
attention. She appreciated every objec-&#xD;
tion, and quickly assented to every propo-&#xD;
sition which was sustained by the authority&#xD;
of reason.&#xD;
Davidson and his young bride were&#xD;
seate(l cosily together, in a distant part of&#xD;
the saloon, and it was easy to discover&#xD;
that the first hours of the honeymoon had&#xD;
not yet passed.&#xD;
Fielding and Helen, too, were apart&#xD;
from the rest. They did not shrink from&#xD;
isolation in that sweet dream of love, frdrn&#xD;
which there is always an awakening.&#xD;
Why may it not last for ever'? An exis-&#xD;
tence in the realms where Cupid holds&#xD;
dominion, is changed with sadness for&#xD;
that of stern reality. The airy conscious-&#xD;
ness of bliss-the blending of two hearts&#xD;
that have hitherto been separated by the&#xD;
conventionalities of life-the departure ot&#xD;
(lonbt arid the certainty of possession,&#xD;
after being realized for a brief honr, like&#xD;
all earthly emotions, lose their freshness&#xD;
in the solemn duties of mortality. "'Twas&#xD;
bright, 'twas heavenly, but 'tis past."&#xD;
Clifton and Mrs. Broughton were prome-&#xD;
nading the hurricane (leck. The air was&#xD;
more balmy as they descended the river;&#xD;
and vegetation was bursting forth under&#xD;
the magical power of a Southern sun.&#xD;
They had taken tea and resumed their&#xD;
walk upon the spacious deck. The night&#xD;
was clear and starlit, and they gazed at&#xD;
the shadowy banks, and broad savannas,&#xD;
as the majestic steamer swiftly glided down&#xD;
the swollen Mississippi. Occasionally they&#xD;
would meet a steamboat breasting th rapid&#xD;
current, and a friendly greeting was inter-&#xD;
changed by the ringing of bells. Innu-&#xD;
merable flat-b ont s ~vere passed, whose&#xD;
dark outlines sat motionless upon the river,&#xD;
or rocked in the waves of the Randolph.&#xD;
The music of a violin came across the&#xD;
xvater, mingling with the melody of the&#xD;
boatman's song. It floated over the tide&#xD;
at first indistinctly, and then as the steamer&#xD;
approached the inert mass, the words&#xD;
were plainly heard-&#xD;
",Ve'li dance nil night till broad daylight,&#xD;
And go home with the galls in the morning."&#xD;
A voice from the boat exclaimed,&#xD;
"It is the Randolph. Hallo! Bill Smith-&#xD;
ers."&#xD;
"Hallo yourself!~~ was answered from&#xD;
the lower deck.&#xD;
"What's the news above ~&#xD;
"Kirkman's burst her ~&#xD;
"How many killed'?"&#xD;
"Only twelve. Dick Henley 'mong&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"'The devil! Where'bouts'?" came in-&#xD;
C&#xD;
&#xD;
distinctly from the questioner, but the&#xD;
Randolph had swept by, and the answer&#xD;
was lost upon ihe waters.&#xD;
"Those are happy fellows. Would you&#xD;
believe it, Mrs. Broughton'?"&#xD;
"They seem to be, although the only&#xD;
thing to relieve the tedium and monotony&#xD;
of such a voyage, must be its perils.)~&#xD;
"And yet they enter upon it as a relaxa-&#xD;
tion and amusement. I recognize the&#xD;
voice which you just heard from the fiat-&#xD;
boat. That person is the owner of fifty&#xD;
slaves, and is worth not less than one hun.&#xD;
dred thousand dollars; still he has been&#xD;
the sport of wind and tide for the last five&#xD;
weeks !"&#xD;
"Is it possible! I thought it was ne-&#xD;
cessity which induced the boatmen to&#xD;
resort to the river."&#xD;
"Not always; it possesses as much at-&#xD;
traction to some of our population, as the&#xD;
deep, deep sea, does for the sailor. Once&#xD;
a year they take an excursion to New Or-&#xD;
leans, with corn, tobacco, cotton, staves,&#xD;
hoop-poles, or poultry, and 'return in a&#xD;
"But is not the voyage surrounded with&#xD;
perils and hardships'?"&#xD;
"With more hardships, surely, than a&#xD;
cabin passage in the Randolph, but not&#xD;
with so many perils, as you can testify !"&#xD;
The lad' shuddered at the recollection of&#xD;
two explosions.&#xD;
C~Accidents rarely ~ he continued;&#xD;
"they are sometimes wrecked in passing&#xD;
the rapids, but the disasters are seldom&#xD;
attended by a loss of life. A boatman has&#xD;
a much easier time now than formerly.&#xD;
He has only to keep his craft in the chan-&#xD;
nel, and float with the current. Befq re&#xD;
steamboats navigated the Western wate ~s,&#xD;
they not only took produce to New Orleans&#xD;
upon these unwieldy flats, but merchan-&#xD;
dise was forced up those streams in keel-&#xD;
boats."&#xD;
"How xvas that done'?"&#xD;
"The goods were packed in a long boat,&#xD;
which had a projection upon each side,&#xD;
just above the water-line. These platforms&#xD;
were occupied by boatmen, who forced&#xD;
the keel against the current, with the aid&#xD;
of long poles.~~&#xD;
"Impossible !"&#xD;
"It is true, I assure you !"&#xD;
"How ~&#xD;
"Sometimes a thousand miles !"&#xD;
"Why, it was worse than the task as-&#xD;
sumed by Sysiphus."&#xD;
"It was no child's play, truly; especially&#xD;
where they xvere obliged to warp it past&#xD;
the rapids."&#xD;
&#xD;
"And how was that accomplished,&#xD;
pray'?"&#xD;
"One end of a long cable was tied to a&#xD;
tree far up the stream, and the other to the&#xD;
capstan, and the boat was warped up the&#xD;
current."&#xD;
"How much we are indebted to Robert&#xD;
Fulton for the application of steam to&#xD;
water craft. The transmission of produce&#xD;
an(l merchandise is now a pleasure.'&#xD;
"Not as much ~o as you may suppose,&#xD;
Mrs. Broughton. The danger of running&#xD;
against snags, the fear of collisions, and&#xD;
the dread of explosions, requires the vigi-&#xD;
lance of the commanders to be sleepless.&#xD;
Their watchfulness is illustrated by an&#xD;
anecdote which is related of Captain Joe&#xD;
Miller. In fair weather, it is his custom&#xD;
to seat himself upon the lower deck, and&#xD;
leaning his back against the capstan, gaze&#xD;
out upon the water. The mischievous&#xD;
mate discoveredd one night, that wearied&#xD;
by long vigils, the commander had fallen&#xD;
asleep. He softly turned the capstan upon&#xD;
which he was seated, until the counte-&#xD;
nance of the old veteran faced the fires;&#xD;
the doors of the grate were then thrown&#xD;
open, and Captain Joe was aroused.&#xD;
Springing to his feet, he shouted, 'Good&#xD;
God, men! reverse the engine, or she will&#xD;
be into us in less than a minute."'&#xD;
Edward and his companion continued&#xD;
to walk the deck until a late hour. The&#xD;
night was lovely, and from off the shore&#xD;
came the breeze laden with the fragrance&#xD;
of early floxvers. The notes of the whip.&#xD;
poor-will were faintly heard, and here and&#xD;
there a light pierced the shrubbery, and&#xD;
danced upon the ~vater. The coast, ho~v-&#xD;
ever, was soon locked in repose, and&#xD;
nothing disturbed the silence of the hour,&#xD;
save the groaning of the engines and the&#xD;
splashing of the water-wheels.&#xD;
"Does it no~t seem like enchantment,&#xD;
Mr. Clifton, tl4s sudden transition from&#xD;
the dreary reg'i on of frost, to the almost&#xD;
perennial bloom of another climate V'&#xD;
"And yet I like our seasons far better.&#xD;
We have variety, instead of sameness,&#xD;
and that, you know, is more attractive."&#xD;
"To your sex, undoubtedly."&#xD;
"Pardon me, if I think not more so&#xD;
than to your own. We tire of a forest&#xD;
~vhen travelling, and long for a clearing to&#xD;
relieve the solitude. When traversing a&#xD;
prairie, xve sicken at the unrelieved waste,&#xD;
and cast our eyes eagerly around in search&#xD;
of woodland. If we are hemmed in by&#xD;
mountains, how gladly we hail the open&#xD;
land ~ and if noffling but hillocks boqnd&#xD;
the vision, with untold pleasure we gaze&#xD;
upon the roughest barrier which Nature has&#xD;

to the calm; new faces fresh scenes, ex-&#xD;
citernents, all help to banish monotony,&#xD;
and to encompass us with that variety&#xD;
which is the charm of human existence.~~~&#xD;
"New faces, I think you said. How&#xD;
complimentary !"&#xD;
"If they ~vere all like yours, Mrs.&#xD;
Broughton, a change~ would be for the&#xD;
worse."&#xD;
"Oh! thank yon," and the lady itiade a&#xD;
low and graceful courtesy.&#xD;
'~Do not think I spoke ironically, for it&#xD;
is the truth! I am unacquainted with any&#xD;
~ady who weors so well as you do !"&#xD;
"Why, do ladies so poorly stand the&#xD;
test of intimacy ?"&#xD;
"I have not mingled much, you know,&#xD;
in the society of ladies; still I have found&#xD;
that some of them become insipid.~~&#xD;
"Really, then, I should advise them to&#xD;
see less of you."&#xD;
\ "I hope you will not follow the advice&#xD;
rself."&#xD;
Arid why not? I had better retreat&#xD;
while I have your good opinion."&#xD;
"That you will be sure to have, under&#xD;
any circumstances. You have too often&#xD;
revealed the delights of Nature, to one&#xD;
who was ignorant of its power, to suffer&#xD;
me to become either ungrateful or unjust.~~&#xD;
"Why, what on earth are you two&#xD;
amusing yourselves about, at this late&#xD;
hour !" exclaimed Dr. Fielding,' as the&#xD;
married coterie advanced along the deck.&#xD;
"We are not unmindful of the beauties&#xD;
of Nature; that is all."&#xD;
"Neither are we ;" and the Doctor bowed&#xD;
to his fair companions.&#xD;
"We have been discussing the new&#xD;
style of dress, Mrs. Broughton,~ observed&#xD;
Helen.&#xD;
"And what do you think of it ?"&#xD;
~' That it was invented for the benefit of&#xD;
ladies whose forms are not as faultless as&#xD;
that of the Greek slave."&#xD;
"Doubtless, and the aforesaid ladies are&#xD;
trying to induce all others to adopt the&#xD;
fashion, although it is far less graceful&#xD;
than the old."&#xD;
"In which particular they resemble an&#xD;
unfortunate Reynard," remarked Harden.&#xD;
"How so?"&#xD;
"A fox prowling upon forbidden pre-&#xD;
mises, unfortunately had his tail cut off by&#xD;
a steel-trap. Fearful of becoming thp&#xD;
laughing-stock of his companions, he im-&#xD;
mediately announced a new fashion-that&#xD;
of wearing no tails. It became popular,&#xD;
and in a few days there~ was not a fox in&#xD;
the pack that had a tail for ornament or&#xD;
use. But I do not see anything about the&#xD;
&#xD;
anecdote to cause so much suppressed&#xD;
merriment," continued Harden, confused-&#xD;
ly, as the ladies proceeded in a body along&#xD;
the deck, and at last gave vent to merry&#xD;
peals of laughter.&#xD;
As the middle watch was changed, they&#xD;
all left the deck and retired to their state-&#xD;
rooms. The Randolph was gliding through&#xD;
an eddy, whose current was running up&#xD;
stream, when the passengers were aroused&#xD;
from slumber by a concussion which shook&#xD;
the vast fabric to its centre. In a moment&#xD;
the most intense excitement prevailed&#xD;
throughout the boat. Edward darted to-&#xD;
wards the bow, for the purpose of ascer-&#xD;
taining the nature of the accident, and&#xD;
caught the startling intelligence which was&#xD;
communicated by one deck-band to ano-&#xD;
ther-" Tire hold is filling with water." At&#xD;
the same moment he saw Captain Miller&#xD;
running towards the pilot-house. He&#xD;
paused a moment, and remarked, "Mr.&#xD;
Cliftour arouse the passengers at once; the&#xD;
Randolph will sink in less than t~veuty&#xD;
minutes." Retreating to the saloon, Ed-&#xD;
ward met the stewardto whom he repeated&#xD;
the information. The latter instantly seized&#xD;
a bell, and, ringing it furiously, soon awak-&#xD;
ened the passengers. The Randolph was&#xD;
a long distance from land, when her keel&#xD;
struck the sawyer, and as soon as Captain&#xD;
Miller seized the helm, her bow was turned&#xD;
towards the shore, But, the collision had&#xD;
proved much more disastrous than any one&#xD;
supposed, and before the ill-fated steamer&#xD;
had passed over half the distance to the&#xD;
bank, there were half-a-dozen feet of water&#xD;
in her hold. The total destruction of the&#xD;
boat and cargo was not only threatened,&#xD;
but the passengers were surrounded by im-&#xD;
minent perils. The place of greatest se-&#xD;
curity was the hurricane deck, and thither&#xD;
the cabin and steerage passengers crowded.&#xD;
They had all gained that position, and&#xD;
With feverish excitement watched the pro-&#xD;
gress of the boat, as it seemed, to their&#xD;
overwrought fancy, to (Irag at a snail's&#xD;
pace towards the shore. The Randolph&#xD;
was slowly settling into the water, as the&#xD;
remorseless element rose to her lower&#xD;
deck, when Helen exclaimed, in a voice&#xD;
trembling with terror-&#xD;
"For Heaven's sake, where is Mrs.&#xD;
Broughton ?"&#xD;
"Good God! is she not here ?" answered&#xD;
Clifton.&#xD;
"N~ no! she could not have been&#xD;
awakened."&#xD;
Edward waited to heirr no more, but&#xD;
hastil)r descended the staircase, notwith-&#xD;
standing the assertion of Captain Miller,&#xD;
that the boat would sink before he could&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
return. Fortunately, he knew the number&#xD;
of her state-room. It was the last but one&#xD;
in the ladies' saloon. He knocked upon&#xD;
the door~ No response came back. He&#xD;
shook it violently; still all was silent. A&#xD;
voice shouted from the forwri~rd part of the&#xD;
boat, " Sheis sinking !~' With an effort of&#xD;
Herculean strength, the young man burst&#xD;
the door from its hinges. The object of&#xD;
his search had risen from her bed, and&#xD;
overcome with terror, had swooned, and&#xD;
was now lying upon the carpet, uncon-&#xD;
scious of the dangers which surrounded&#xD;
her. Edward raised her yielding form in&#xD;
his arms, and emerging into the saloon,&#xD;
was proceeding rapidly in the direction of&#xD;
the staircase, when the bow of the boat&#xD;
sunk into the river, and the water rolled&#xD;
along the cabin. His escape by the stair-&#xD;
case was cut off. For a moment he was&#xD;
paralysed by the apprehensions of an in-&#xD;
stant and terrible death, and then sum-&#xD;
moning all his courage, he retreated to the&#xD;
farther end of the ladies cabin, and pass-&#xD;
ing through a state-room, plunged into the&#xD;
Mississippi, in time to avoid being carried&#xD;
down by the descendingg mass.&#xD;
Fortunately for the passengers, the bow of&#xD;
the Randolph had glided into shoal water&#xD;
before the catastrophe occurred, and the&#xD;
front part of the hurricane deck was above&#xD;
the surface of the river. Cables were&#xD;
taken ashore, and the wreck was secured.&#xD;
A shout for aid was heard, coming from&#xD;
the bosom of the stream, but each mo-&#xD;
rnent it grew fainter and fainter.&#xD;
"Launch the boat !" exclaimed the&#xD;
voice of Captain Miller.&#xD;
"It is Clifton! let me accompany you !"&#xD;
said Fielding.&#xD;
The life-boat was soon rapidly cutting&#xD;
the tide in the direction fro9rr whence the&#xD;
voice proceeded. silence now brooded&#xD;
upon the water, and the conviction sunk&#xD;
like lead upon the heart of Fielding, that&#xD;
his friend had perished. With the assist-&#xD;
ance of lanterns they endeavoured to&#xD;
pierce the gloom, still nothing but an in-&#xD;
terminable waste of waters could be seen.&#xD;
" Hold !" shouted Captain Miller, "I&#xD;
saw two bodies sink hereaway.~~&#xD;
The boat hovered near the spot, arid for&#xD;
several moments they gazed, with straining&#xD;
eyeballs, into the deep.&#xD;
"Here they are !" exclaimed Fielding&#xD;
as two heads rose almost to the surface,&#xD;
arid then receded again. With a sud-&#xD;
den spring the Doctor caught Clifton&#xD;
by the hair, and raising his head above&#xD;
the water, the two bodies were taken into&#xD;
the boat. Clifton's arm encircled the&#xD;
waist of the lady, while hers clasped his&#xD;
&#xD;
form, so as completely to paralyse his ex-&#xD;
ertions.&#xD;
"This is the cause of their ~&#xD;
said Fielding, as he enclosed the arms of&#xD;
Mrs. Broughton. "He was an excellent&#xD;
swimmer, and would have kept them&#xD;
both above the water much longer, if his&#xD;
arms had been free."&#xD;
The faces of both were pale. A faint&#xD;
flutter was perceptible in the region of&#xD;
Edward's heart; but the form of the lady&#xD;
was icy and motionless. Death had un-&#xD;
mistakeably placed his seal upon her&#xD;
marble forehead. As soon as they reach-&#xD;
ed the steamboat, every exertion was used&#xD;
to restore Edward to consciousness, while&#xD;
the weeping females hung over the cold&#xD;
and pulseless form of their late com-&#xD;
panion.&#xD;
The efforts of skill and affection tri-&#xD;
umphed. The colour returned to his cheeks,&#xD;
and the sufferer unclosed his eyes. He&#xD;
gazed at first wonderingly upon his friends,&#xD;
and then his eyes rested for a long time&#xD;
upon the form of Mrs. Broughton. At&#xD;
length he turned ~*ay, with a mournful&#xD;
shake of the head, which made the scald-&#xD;
ing tears course down the cheeks of the&#xD;
most unfeeling. The language, expres-&#xD;
sive, though voiceless, plainly uttered, "I&#xD;
would have saved you, but I could not."&#xD;
A melancholy party left the Randolph,&#xD;
and going on board another steamboat,&#xD;
started once more for New Orleans. It&#xD;
was their painful duty to deliver the soul-&#xD;
less remains of the wife, to the shudder-&#xD;
ing embrace of the husband. Grief as-&#xD;
sumed the throne, where mirth had ruled&#xD;
before; so sudden and inexorable are the&#xD;
decrees of death. The calm, cold clay,&#xD;
was even more lovely than when a hap-&#xD;
py, buoyant spirit inhabited the mortal&#xD;
tenement. The graceful outlines were&#xD;
unwanted by disease, and the complexion&#xD;
had assumed a marble whiteness, save&#xD;
where a rosy hue had regained its empire&#xD;
in her cheeks, and re-illumed the smiling&#xD;
lips. The long dark lashes seemed to&#xD;
tremble as though her expressive eyes&#xD;
were in the act of resuming their power.&#xD;
The form appeared to be slumbering tran-&#xD;
q nilly, whil76 the soul was wandering in&#xD;
the land of dreams, and the lips were slight-&#xD;
ly parted as if to welcome its return. It&#xD;
was difficult to realize that it was the last,&#xD;
long sleep, from which there is no awak-&#xD;
ing, until the nations are summoned by&#xD;
the archangel's trump, to appear at the&#xD;
judgment seat.&#xD;

CHAPTER XLIII.&#xD;
"In the lexicon of youth which fate reserves for&#xD;
bright manhood, there is no such word as fail I"&#xD;
I3ULWER.&#xD;
Tan Congressional convention was t&#xD;
meet at Sherwood in a week; for the nomi&#xD;
nations were usually made in April. Ever~&#xD;
county had selected delegates. Not suci&#xD;
persons as are used by Tjimmany Hall&#xD;
and the politicians who meet at the Broad&#xD;
way Hotel, bnt the substantial portion o&#xD;
the community who cannot be Aired t&#xD;
nominate a person because he carries&#xD;
long purse, with the strings untied. Ir&#xD;
cities, the practice of nominating candi.&#xD;
dates, is too often an absurd burlesque&#xD;
Unless an aspirant will suffer the political&#xD;
hucksters to bleed him freely, he stand&#xD;
no chance. Blackguards rule the ballot.&#xD;
box, because candidates are selected al&#xD;
the point of a bludgeon, and within the&#xD;
swing of a slung-shot. Respectable peo.&#xD;
pIe will not mingle with bullies, and the&#xD;
latter therefore have full sway. Perhaps&#xD;
this melancholy condition of affairs it&#xD;
more strikingly illustrated in the Empire&#xD;
City, than in any other. Meetings are sus-&#xD;
tained or put down by hired rowdies, and&#xD;
the arm of the rioter is more powerful&#xD;
than reason or patriotism. A meeting&#xD;
was called in the Park, to denounce a&#xD;
public functionary.. A dozen men were&#xD;
present, nine of whom were sent by the&#xD;
office-holder himself. The chairman was&#xD;
hustled out, a new one appointed, and&#xD;
resolutions complimenting the public func-&#xD;
tionary were passed unanimously. When&#xD;
the first Texas meeting was held in New&#xD;
York, it was denounced as a Tyler move-&#xD;
ment, the stand was pulled down, one&#xD;
man was killed, the coat was torn from&#xD;
the body of the speaker; and yet within&#xD;
four months, the longest torchlight pro-&#xD;
cession ever witnessed in the city, was&#xD;
got up by the advocates of annexation.&#xD;
Men push themselves prominently for-&#xD;
ward, in primary assemblages, who&#xD;
~vould not be allowed, in the Southern&#xD;
States, to occupy the position of door-&#xD;
keepers. The evil will increase until the&#xD;
respectable portion of the community per-&#xD;
emptorily refuse to support a ticket that&#xD;
the rabble have had the slightest agency in&#xD;
forming. Their candidates, instead of&#xD;
courting and paying for the friendship of&#xD;
blackguards, will be taught to discounte-&#xD;
nance and disown them. Even now it is&#xD;
a cause for congratulation, that the nomi-&#xD;
nees, who have resorted to disreputable&#xD;
expedients to secure a nomination, are&#xD;
often defeated at the polls. When this is&#xD;
&#xD;
universally the case, the law and order&#xD;
men will have discharged their duty. How&#xD;
a different is the condition of public opinion&#xD;
in the Southern States? None but men of&#xD;
high character, are chosen as delegates,&#xD;
) and when they make a nomination, it&#xD;
- secures the support of the party. It is&#xD;
~ rarely the case in a poll of ten thousand,&#xD;
1 that a solitary democrat or whig refuses&#xD;
to vote the party ticket.&#xD;
It ~as apparent, to~all, that Clifton&#xD;
f would receivee the unanimous nomination&#xD;
for C tigress. His exertions had been&#xD;
crown ~d with so much success in the&#xD;
Presidential contest, that he had a host&#xD;
* of friends in the district. It is useless&#xD;
to deny that he felt a deep interest&#xD;
I in the proceedings ~of the primary meet-&#xD;
ings which assembled in the different&#xD;
counties. Although he took no part, di-&#xD;
rectly or indirectly, in getting them up,&#xD;
still, as one after another instructed their&#xD;
* delegates to vote for Edward Clifton, a&#xD;
feeling of gratitude for the warmth of&#xD;
their devotion was uppermost in his heart.&#xD;
At Bergen, a preference was, expressed&#xD;
by one of the crowd for Blount Merri-&#xD;
* weather. The announcement instantly&#xD;
called Squire Burrows, a democratic&#xD;
veteran, to his feet, who exclaimed vehe-&#xD;
mently; "What has Blount Merriweather&#xD;
done to command our support? Has* he&#xD;
not always proved a fair ~veather demo-&#xD;
crat? Did he ever battle in our cause&#xD;
when our ranks were dispirited by defeat,&#xD;
and the success of our candidates was&#xD;
doubtfulif not hopeless? No, sir, he is&#xD;
not the man for a crisis- lie lacks the&#xD;
moral. courage to head a forlorn hope.&#xD;
Such an individual can never become a&#xD;
successful leader. He alone is entitled to&#xD;
the championOhip, who exhibits intrepidi-&#xD;
ty in the hour of defeat, as well as in the&#xD;
moment of victory. That person is Ed-&#xD;
ward Clifton we have tried him. Where&#xD;
is the orator who would have per-&#xD;
formed the duties which he did in the&#xD;
last canvass? Neither storms nor heat,&#xD;
arrested his movements, and for half a&#xD;
year his time was devoted to the advocacy&#xD;
of our cause, and the defence of our prin-&#xD;
ciples. And now, when honours are at&#xD;
our disposal, we ungratefully confer them&#xD;
upon another! Such, gentlemen, is not the&#xD;
way I cancel my obligations. Gratitude, as&#xD;
well as duty, points unerringly to Mr. Clif-&#xD;
ton as the democratic candidate, and to&#xD;
abandon him now, would be dastardly&#xD;
and unjust. I for one will never consent&#xD;
to it, until his claims are rejected by the&#xD;
Congressional convention. Mr. Chairman,&#xD;
I propose that our delegates be instructed to&#xD;
&#xD;
vote first, last, and all the time, for Edward&#xD;
Clifton."&#xD;
it is needless to say that the proposition&#xD;
was carried by an overwhelming majority.&#xD;
The village of Sherwood was thronged&#xD;
with delegates. it was remarked that&#xD;
they were an unusually honest and deter-&#xD;
mined-looking body of men. The pre-&#xD;
sence of some of them was an indication&#xD;
that they felt a deep interest in the result,&#xD;
as they had come on horseback, a distance&#xD;
of sixty miles.&#xD;
The convention was organized by the&#xD;
appointment of Col. Miller as President.&#xD;
~ nomination was proposed in a&#xD;
resolution offered by Senator Harden. A&#xD;
delegate from an adjacent county opposed&#xD;
it upon the grour~d that the candidate was&#xD;
too youthful. He observed, "Mr. Clifton&#xD;
1 understand is not yet twenty-five years&#xD;
of age, and to send so young a person to&#xD;
the halls of congress , would I think be&#xD;
setting a bad precedent. I will frankly&#xD;
confess that his age is the only objection&#xD;
which I can urge against his nomination.&#xD;
But that to me is insuperable. You can-&#xD;
not have forgotten that he obtained during&#xD;
the Presidential conflict the soubriquet of&#xD;
the young ~&#xD;
The delegates listened impatiently to&#xD;
this objection, and when the speaker had&#xD;
resumed his seat, a dozen metnbers sprang&#xD;
to their feet. Harden wa~ recognized by&#xD;
the chair.&#xD;
"I deem it almost unnccesshry," he&#xD;
commenced, "for me to express my dis-&#xD;
sent to the opinions which have just been&#xD;
announced. I can see they are disap-&#xD;
proved by almost every member of this&#xD;
convention, including its presiding officer.&#xD;
But a due regard for the prejudices of the&#xD;
gentleman who has just restimed his seat,&#xD;
prompts me to remove his doubts, if pos-&#xD;
sible. I know his influence, and am&#xD;
anxious to secure his support for the&#xD;
ticket."&#xD;
This politic allusion was well received&#xD;
by the delegate, who immediately re-&#xD;
marked-&#xD;
'' The nominee shall have that, whoever&#xD;
he may be."&#xD;
"I am glad to hear ~ resumed Har-&#xD;
den. ~ what I expected from his&#xD;
known adherence to principle. But to his&#xD;
objections. On the day of election, Mr.&#xD;
Clifton will be twenty-five years old. The&#xD;
fathers of the republic recognized that age&#xD;
as sufficient to qualify a person to dis-&#xD;
charge the duties of a Congressman. It is&#xD;
surely unnecessary to appeal to history in&#xD;
confirmation of their judgment. Hannibal&#xD;
and Bonaparte overran Italy before they&#xD;
&#xD;
were twenty-six. A small portion of the&#xD;
world only was left unconquered by Alex-&#xD;
ander, when he was t~venty-five. At the&#xD;
age of Clifton, the three mightiest con-&#xD;
querors of the world had covered them-&#xD;
selves with immortal renown. William&#xD;
Pitt, the most illustrious of British states-&#xD;
men, was Chancellor of the Exchequer at&#xD;
twenty-two. But 1 will not multiply illus-&#xD;
trations. What pretext is there Ibr the&#xD;
assertion that the favourite of this conven-&#xD;
tion is too young? If he is still youthful,&#xD;
has he not the fire and enthusiasm which&#xD;
is necessary to accomplish great ends ~&#xD;
Where did he encounter a successful op-&#xD;
ponent in the last canvass? And yet the&#xD;
oldest, youngest, and ablest wliig orators&#xD;
were arrayed against him. And, as if this&#xD;
was not' sufficient, did not the United&#xD;
States District Attorney resign his office,&#xD;
for the purpose of attempting to arrest the&#xD;
tide which was setting in so strongly against&#xD;
Mr. Clay in this district? I speak ad-&#xD;
visedly when I say that Clifton conducted&#xD;
the canvass without the slightest desire for&#xD;
personAl rewards. He is devoted to his&#xD;
profession, and regards political office as a&#xD;
great barrier to professional eminence.&#xD;
His name was proposed without his sanc-&#xD;
tion, as a candidate for Congress, in&#xD;
several preliminary meetings; his repu-&#xD;
tation is now in the hands of this con-&#xD;
vention, and he would be above human&#xD;
infirmities if he did not take a deep in-&#xD;
terest in our deliberations. No one can&#xD;
present such powerful claims to our sup-&#xD;
port as Edward Clifton, and I know that I&#xD;
speak the sentiments of this convention,&#xD;
and the people whom they represent, when&#xD;
I declare that we should be dislionouring&#xD;
ourselves more than him, if we leave&#xD;
this hall without tendering a unanimous&#xD;
nomination for Congress to C the young&#xD;
elector.' ~&#xD;
These' remarks were frequently inter-&#xD;
rupted by great applause, and as Harden&#xD;
concluded, the~ assembly arose to their&#xD;
feet and gave 'three tremendous cheers.&#xD;
Harden's resolution was carried by accld-&#xD;
ration.'&#xD;
Edward had several cases to dispose of&#xD;
before opening the canvass, and among&#xD;
the number was a suit which he was de-&#xD;
fen~ng for a Mr. Franklin.&#xD;
"But will the cause be tried this term ?"&#xD;
Yes; both parties are prepared, and&#xD;
for one I am anxious to get rid of it."&#xD;
"It has been on th~ calendar a long&#xD;
time. What are the f~ts in the case? I&#xD;
am ignorant of them, r~hough I heard of&#xD;
the case a long time ago."&#xD;
"Simply these. Franklin, and Drum-&#xD;

mond, his co-defendant, were members&#xD;
of the county court, a tribunal having&#xD;
wer to appoint guardians. One was Se-&#xD;
I~ected for the plaintiff, ~b~ut sufficient se-&#xD;
curity was not taken, and the assets in-&#xD;
trusted to his hands were squandered. It&#xD;
appears by the record that Franklin, my&#xD;
client, was on the bench when the court&#xD;
met, but that Drumniond, and two others,&#xD;
signed the minutes. Now if either or both&#xD;
of the defendantss made the appointment,&#xD;
the plaintiff will recover, provided there is&#xD;
no other defence. The question is~ who&#xD;
was upon the bench at the time the order&#xD;
was made. Thefacl is) that Franklin left it&#xD;
immediately after the court niet, but he&#xD;
cannot prove t."&#xD;
The trial came on, and the case of Bris-&#xD;
ton vs. Franklin and Drummond, was at&#xD;
last before the jury. The cause attracted&#xD;
much attention, and the court-house was&#xD;
crowded as Edward rose to address the&#xD;
court.&#xD;
"It is my purpose, may it please the&#xD;
~ he corn menaced, "to be very brief&#xD;
in the investigation of this case. The law&#xD;
and the facts are embraced in a nut-shell.&#xD;
If either of these defendants are liable, it&#xD;
surely is not my client. The question is,&#xD;
who appointed the guardian 3 The orders&#xD;
of the court are not complete until they&#xD;
are signed. If they are, why is that&#xD;
formality necessary 3 The practice of the&#xD;
court was to hear the minutes read the&#xD;
morning after they were entered, and then&#xD;
affix their names to the record. Until it&#xD;
was signed, the minutes were under, the&#xD;
supervision of ~the court. Mr. Franklin&#xD;
did not sanction the orders of the court on&#xD;
the day after this appointment was made,&#xD;
for the record shows that it was approved&#xD;
by Mr. Drummond and others. He is&#xD;
therefore liable, if anybody is, for the fail-&#xD;
ure to take security. But there is one im-&#xD;
passable barrier to a recovery by the plain-&#xD;
tiff. The action is barred by the statute&#xD;
of limitations. I would not rely upon this&#xD;
/ defence if I did not know that my client&#xD;
was guiltless of all blame. Actions of this&#xD;
kind are barred, if not commenced within&#xD;
three years after the removal of a disability&#xD;
It was the duty of the plaintiff to institute&#xD;
his suit within three years after his ma-&#xD;
jority. He has not done so. The writ&#xD;
was issued on his twenty-foirth birthday "&#xD;
"Very well, Mr. Clifton," interposed&#xD;
the Judge, "that was sufficient, as three&#xD;
years had not elapsed until the following&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"Just so thou~t his mother, may it&#xD;
please your honour, when she swore in&#xD;
this deposition to statements which she&#xD;
&#xD;
'T O N.&#xD;
&#xD;
thought would just cover the case. The&#xD;
witness and the court both labour under a&#xD;
mistake as to the law. This writ bears&#xD;
date the 15th day of March, 1840. Mrs.&#xD;
Briston testifies that her son was twenty-&#xD;
four years of age on the 15th day of&#xD;
March, 1840. The plaintiff, on the con-&#xD;
trary, was, in the eye of the law, twenty-&#xD;
four years old on the 14th day of March,&#xD;
1840."&#xD;
"What, the day before his birthday 3"&#xD;
asked the Judge.&#xD;
"Exactly so."&#xD;
"Th~ court would like to know how you&#xD;
will make that appear."&#xD;
"I will show your honour. It is a well-&#xD;
settled principle of law that parts Qf a day&#xD;
are never recognized. The day, one and&#xD;
indivisible, is alone counted."&#xD;
"The court admits that proposition."&#xD;
"Very well. There are three hundred&#xD;
and sixty-five days in a year. The plain-&#xD;
tiff was born on the 15th day of March,&#xD;
1816 at 10 o'clock, A. M. The 15th day&#xD;
of March 1816, being in law indivisible,&#xD;
counts as one day, and the child had&#xD;
completed three hundred and sixty-five&#xD;
days on the 14th of March, 1817. You.&#xD;
cannot count the 15th t~vice, because if&#xD;
you do, the year will be composed of&#xD;
three hundred and sixty-six days. In fact&#xD;
the child was a yearold on the 15th day of&#xD;
March, 1817, ~it 10 o'clock, A. M., but&#xD;
not in law. Follow out the proposition.&#xD;
Mr. Briston was twenty-one years old on&#xD;
the 14th of March, 1837, and oughtto&#xD;
have instituted his suit on or before the&#xD;
14th day of March, 1840. Not having&#xD;
done so, his right of action is lost by the&#xD;
statute of limitations.~'&#xD;
" You are right, Mr. Clifton," observed&#xD;
the court; "the plaintiff might as ~vell&#xD;
agree to a non-suit."&#xD;
In the month of May, 1845, Edward&#xD;
opened the campaign for Congress. The&#xD;
whigs nominated Malcolm Macgregor as&#xD;
his opponent. This gentleman ~vas born&#xD;
in the district, and from that fact expected&#xD;
to obtain democratic votes. A host of&#xD;
kinsmen belonged to the opposite party,&#xD;
and as they were Scotchmen, and conse-&#xD;
quently clannish, he hoped that they would&#xD;
manifest greater devotion to their relation,&#xD;
than to their principles. i'm this expecta-&#xD;
tion the whig leaders coincided, and confi-&#xD;
dently expected that Clifton would be de-&#xD;
feated. Although they did not dislike him&#xD;
personally, and were cautious~ what terms&#xD;
they employed when referring to his po-&#xD;
litical career, still many of them had been&#xD;
handled rather roughly in the last canvass,&#xD;
and would now rejoice at the frustration of&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
his hopes. It was predicted, too, that a&#xD;
p~sonal difficulty would take place be-&#xD;
tween the candidates. They were both&#xD;
young and impetuous, and the political&#xD;
forum is more likely than all other places&#xD;
to test the sweetness of one's temper. If&#xD;
your indignation finds vent in an expres-&#xD;
sion more than ordinarily severe, a chal-&#xD;
lenge follows, or a personal collision at&#xD;
once ensues. The danger is enhanced by&#xD;
the presence of political friends, and hos-&#xD;
tile opponents, the one t&#xD;
other to scoff.      o cheer, and the&#xD;
"And so you open the ball at Bergen&#xD;
to-morrow, Clifton," observed Fielding.&#xD;
"DoesHarden accompany you3"&#xD;
"Yes;oxviug to my persuasions, he has&#xD;
accepted the nomination for a re-election&#xD;
to the Senate."&#xD;
"I am glad of it. The senatorial dis-&#xD;
trict is composed of four counties, which&#xD;
you will have to canvass~ and he will be&#xD;
a pleasant companion, as well as a power-&#xD;
ful assistant upon the stump.~~&#xD;
"I assure you I have a proper appre-&#xD;
ciation of the facts which you have men-&#xD;
tioned."&#xD;
"What do you think of your opponent,&#xD;
Clifton 3"&#xD;
"I have never met him upon the stump.&#xD;
He is said to be a good speaker, but rather&#xD;
an unscrupulous claimer; something&#xD;
like Major Henderson."&#xD;
"You will have an 'affair' with him&#xD;
then, before the canvass is over."&#xD;
"A candidate may always anticipate a&#xD;
difficulty when he meets an opponent on&#xD;
the stump, and if he avoids one, it is a&#xD;
species of good fortune for which he ought&#xD;
to be grateful.~~&#xD;
"You passed through the Presidential&#xD;
conflict without a personal encounter."&#xD;
"I was then advocating the claims of&#xD;
another, not my own. A person canvass-&#xD;
ing for himself is far 'A ore sensitive."&#xD;
"Why is it that l~vyers so much more&#xD;
rarely have t]eadly combats than politi-&#xD;
cians."&#xD;
"Because they are accustomed to the&#xD;
rules of debate, and besides, live electors,&#xD;
they are speaking for others. Members&#xD;
of the bar are not so apt to come into col-&#xD;
lision, when they are candidates, as other&#xD;
classes of the community.~~&#xD;
"Macgregor is not a member of the&#xD;
barl"&#xD;
"No, he is a physician.~~&#xD;
"Then you had better go prepared for&#xD;
any emergency. Our profession are in-&#xD;
clined to be obstinate, and a dogged ad-&#xD;
herence to settled opinions is more cha-&#xD;
&#xD;
racteristic of the medical fraternity, than a&#xD;
frank acknowledgment of error."&#xD;
"You arefra~ik to make the admission."&#xD;
"I would not proclaim it on the high-&#xD;
ways, but 1(10 not hesitate to tell you. So&#xD;
you would do well to commence the can-&#xD;
vass prepared, ~at any moment, to admi-&#xD;
nis~r a pill, not of his owa making, either,&#xD;
to Dr. Macgregor."&#xD;
"Do you think this will do 3" inquired&#xD;
Edward, as he took a heavy revolver from&#xD;
his desk.&#xD;
"I have a very poor opinion of Colt's&#xD;
revolvers, generally," responded Fielding,&#xD;
" and would rather trust to a Durringer, or&#xD;
a bowie-knife. This, however, seems to&#xD;
be a substantial weapon.7~&#xD;
"A Durringer has but one ball, and it&#xD;
is a penitentiary offence to use' a bowie-&#xD;
knife." -&#xD;
Yes; our legislators, in order to con-&#xD;
ciliate the pious community, are doing all&#xD;
they can to sink the chivalry of the South.&#xD;
They will never be satisfied until we be-&#xD;
come as spiritless and cowardly as a na-&#xD;
tion of traders usually are."&#xD;
"And so you believe personal conflicts&#xD;
are necessary to preserve our character for&#xD;
intrepidity 3" said Judge Douglass, who&#xD;
had just entered Clifton's office.&#xD;
"Submission to insult by nations or&#xD;
individuals has a tendency to degrade&#xD;
character. There are some offences which&#xD;
the law cannot Xunish. The strong right&#xD;
arm must then efend your honour. I be-&#xD;
lieve that wars are a national blessing,&#xD;
when they are not~too frequent. They&#xD;
serve to foster a martial enthusiasm, and&#xD;
keep a people from sinking into that worst&#xD;
of all conditions, a nation of spiritless tra-&#xD;
ffickers."&#xD;
"But you forget that the horrors of the&#xD;
battle-field carry anguish to the domestic&#xD;
circle."&#xD;
"No, I do not~ I admit it all. Still,&#xD;
there are some evils more to be deplored&#xD;
than even that. A loss of self-respect,&#xD;
which follows in the footsteps of departing&#xD;
valour, is far more calamitous. We be-&#xD;
come the willing victims of the strong, and&#xD;
occupy the position of a cipher in the ca-&#xD;
talogue of nations. Not only that, bit the&#xD;
loss of national character is accompanied&#xD;
by that mental imbecility, ~vhich is the&#xD;
fatal enemy of science and of art. Look&#xD;
at those empires which claim the grati-&#xD;
tude of the present age for discoveries that&#xD;
have benefitted mankind. They have&#xD;
become equally celebrated for their mar-&#xD;
tial renown. Where has sculpture, mu-&#xD;
sic, painting, philosophy, astronomy, and&#xD;
belles-Iettres, been illustrated with a splen-&#xD;

guined plains of Greece, the gory valleys&#xD;
of Jtaly, the blood-stained fields of France,&#xD;
and in the smoking villages of old Eng-&#xD;
land. If you want a contrast to this pic-&#xD;
ture, look at China! that land of wooden&#xD;
shoes and mental imbecility, where three&#xD;
hundred millions of people suffer twenty&#xD;
thousand British to batter down the walls&#xD;
of their cities !"&#xD;
"You speak warmly, Doctor."&#xD;
~Because I despise the stupidity which&#xD;
is constantly advocating peace as the&#xD;
greatest blessing which can be conferred&#xD;
upon the human race. It is not strange&#xD;
that an interested clergy should endeavour&#xD;
to transform a martial people into the&#xD;
truculent victims of priestcraft; because&#xD;
the power of the church will then be aug-&#xD;
mented. Donations to religious institu-&#xD;
tions will become even more frequent&#xD;
than they are now. The ties of consan-&#xD;
guinity will be as powerless as a rope of&#xD;
sand, when the mind, enfeebled by dis-&#xD;
ease and palsied with terror, seeks to win&#xD;
a pathway to the celestial regions, by yield-&#xD;
ing to the sordid demands of a clerical&#xD;
comforter."&#xD;
"Do you suppose that the church em-&#xD;
~ ploys improper means for the purpose of&#xD;
obtaining bequests ?"&#xD;
"I have not the slightest doubt of it.&#xD;
Since the dawn of Christianity, or rather&#xD;
since the ascension, the disciples of our&#xD;
Saviour have always understood the value&#xD;
of money. They have employed every&#xD;
means to accumulate the dross of earth&#xD;
before the Reformation by the absolution&#xD;
of sins, and since that time by performing&#xD;
mass for the dead, and smoothing the pas-&#xD;
sage of the dying Protestant to the world&#xD;
of spirits."&#xD;
"Why, surely you cannot condemn that&#xD;
religious consolation which enables the&#xD;
departing soul to look death calmly in the&#xD;
face V'&#xD;
"Not when the consolation is disinte-&#xD;
rested; but if the unscrupulous clergyman&#xD;
hangs over the trembling body, when it is&#xD;
about to yield up its immateriality, and&#xD;
with hypocritical cant induces him to dis-&#xD;
inherit a helpless family~ for the purpose&#xD;
of enriching the chum , the execrations&#xD;
of men and the curse of heaven should fall&#xD;
upon his head !"&#xD;
"But how is this influence brought into&#xD;
action ~ A man has the legal right toklis-&#xD;
pose of his property as he pleases.~~&#xD;
"Leave the modes operandi to the skill&#xD;
of the reverend clergy; they are versed in&#xD;
the mysteries of the human heart. What&#xD;
&#xD;
T 0 N'.&#xD;
&#xD;
is the process, ask you ~ I once witnessed&#xD;
an illustration .of its power. A wealthy&#xD;
planter was taken suddenly ill. The ra-&#xD;
vages of the fever could not be checked,&#xD;
and it was apparent that a speedy dissolu-&#xD;
tion would ensue. Alarmed at his ap-&#xD;
proaching fate, he sent for a clergyman.&#xD;
His life had been reckless and profane, and&#xD;
the meekness of his amiable wife had&#xD;
often been put to the severest test, Over-&#xD;
come with fatigue, I had thrown myself&#xD;
upon the sofa in a secluded corner of the&#xD;
room, and was asleep when the minister&#xD;
entered. I awoke, however, in a few mi-&#xD;
nutes, and knowing that the youthful cler-&#xD;
gyman did not exclusively employ his&#xD;
time in laying up treasures where 'neither&#xD;
moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where&#xD;
thieves do not break through nor steal,'&#xD;
I watched' his movements.&#xD;
"With a solemn and sepulchral voice&#xD;
he began-' I sincerely regret, my dear&#xD;
sir, to find you in this awful condition!'&#xD;
(the enunciation of the word awful being&#xD;
greatly prolonged.)&#xD;
"'So do I, but fate is mesisfiess; can&#xD;
you give me no consolation in this terri-&#xD;
ble moment V And the eyeballs of the&#xD;
dying mortal seemed starting from their&#xD;
sockets as he watched the countenance of&#xD;
the man of God.&#xD;
CC A pause ensued. LYon have lived&#xD;
a remarkably sinful life, Mr. Bradshaw,&#xD;
and although you have been raised un-&#xD;
der the very droppings of the sanctuary,&#xD;
still you have never rendered obedience&#xD;
to the commands of the Almighty.'&#xD;
"'I know it; I know it, Parson Hen-&#xD;
ning; but is it too late now to repent V&#xD;
"'Blessed by the munificence of&#xD;
heaven,' continued the divine, with in-&#xD;
crease(l solemnity, 'you have always&#xD;
manifested your ingratitude by withhold-&#xD;
ing from the church that pecuniary aid&#xD;
which enables it to become the instrument,&#xD;
in the hands of God, for the accomplish-&#xD;
ment of much good.'&#xD;
"At this apparent extinction of his&#xD;
hopes, the sick man sunk back with a&#xD;
groan. In a few moments he turned to&#xD;
the minister, and in a faint, but earnest&#xD;
voice, whispered,&#xD;
"'Is it too late to make amends for my&#xD;
remissness and folly V&#xD;
"'The clergyman shook his head, and&#xD;
responded sadly: 'It is the duty of mor-&#xD;
tals to employ the gifts of a Supreme Ruler&#xD;
in promoting the eternal interests of the&#xD;
human race. This life is but a fleeting&#xD;
hour, ~iven us to prepare for that existence&#xD;
which has no end~'&#xD;
"'But surely, an indulgent God will not&#xD;

refuse a death-bed repentance to one who&#xD;
is willing to aid his chosen servants'&#xD;
"'But you have never done 5~*~&#xD;
"'I will do so now, if it is not too late,'&#xD;
said the agonized Bradshaw, as the clam-&#xD;
my perspiration gathered in large drops&#xD;
upon his forehead. I caught a flitting&#xD;
glance of Henning~ s countenance. A gleam&#xD;
of triumph was succeeded by a hard, re-&#xD;
lentless expression, which seemed to say,&#xD;
c There is no harm in torturing him some&#xD;
more.' He continued, 'The individual who&#xD;
sets at defiance the commands of God,&#xD;
faces a terrible responsibility! If he obeys&#xD;
the divine requirements, an eternity of bliss&#xD;
awaits him beyond the river of death.&#xD;
But if, like you, Mr. Bradshaw, he revels&#xD;
in sin and iniquity through a long life,&#xD;
without one act of charity, his mortal ca-&#xD;
reer will terminate, but what becomes of&#xD;
his immortal spirit ~ It will either be for&#xD;
ever chained, with its living conscious-&#xD;
ness, to the body, in that silent, cold,&#xD;
dreary, remorseless grave, from which&#xD;
there is no escape, or exist through an&#xD;
eternity of suffering, in the lake of un-&#xD;
quenchable fire!'&#xD;
"'For God's sake, forbear!' shrieked&#xD;
Bradshaw, as his body shook convulsively&#xD;
for a minute, and then all was still. I was&#xD;
in the act of springing from the sofa, when&#xD;
Henning started to his feet, and exclaimed,&#xD;
'I have carried it too far! fool that I&#xD;
was; but where is a restorative~~ He&#xD;
applied the hartshorn to the nostrils of&#xD;
the fainting man, who shortly opened his&#xD;
eyes; but it was evident he was fast sink-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"~You spoke of giving aid, but now to&#xD;
the chosen servants of God !" whispered&#xD;
Henning.&#xD;
~ Alas! it is too late,' murmured the&#xD;
dying man.&#xD;
C''It is never too late to repent! God is&#xD;
always ready to ~velcome the sinner.'&#xD;
"'Do you think so V said the other joy-&#xD;
fully. 'Oh! I will do an~]thing to secure&#xD;
a pardon!'&#xD;
"'You can greatly assist the humble ser-&#xD;
vants of the Almighty, to spread the truths'&#xD;
of his Divine Word.'&#xD;
~ How '~ Name the conditions ~&#xD;
"'By giving of your wealth to the church&#xD;
You know I am the president of a reli-&#xD;
gious institution; make a bequest to me,-&#xD;
in trust for religious purposes; it will&#xD;
greatly commend you to the mercy of an&#xD;
offended God.'&#xD;
"'I will do it. Name the sum, and&#xD;
quickly too; I am sinking fast.'&#xD;
"'To whom much is given, much will&#xD;

nasal intonation.&#xD;

"'Leave them a small sum! Riches will&#xD;
only distract their attention from their&#xD;
heavenly duties. If poverty overtakes&#xD;
them, it shall be my care to protect them&#xD;

"'As you will!' muttered Bradshaw,&#xD;
faintly. 'There is paper in that drawer;&#xD;
write a will; you must do it soon; my&#xD;
strength is failing; fast! faster !'&#xD;
"Henning seized the pen, and with a&#xD;
fiush6~i cheek, rapidly traced the black&#xD;
lines (not blacker than his heart) upon the&#xD;
spotless sheet. As I was in the act of&#xD;
moving noiselessly from my position, for&#xD;
the purpose of arresting this nefarious&#xD;
transaction. The movement of the pen&#xD;
was arrested, as Henning heard the death-&#xD;
rattle in the throat of his victim. A mo-&#xD;
mentary struggle ensued; the limbs trem-&#xD;
bled, the brow contracted, and then all&#xD;
was over.&#xD;
"'Fool that I was, to delay so long!'&#xD;
burst from the lips of the baffled clergy-&#xD;
man, as he ground his teeth with irre-&#xD;
pressible rage, and dashed away the pen.&#xD;
"As I rose from the sequestered corner,&#xD;
where I had been lying, and advanced to-&#xD;
wards him, his countenance was suffused&#xD;
with a (leep blush, which was quickly&#xD;
succeeded by a livid hue. I fixed my&#xD;
eyes sternly upon his own. His look of&#xD;
disappointment gave place to a meek and&#xD;
sanctimonious expression. I have seldom&#xD;
been so much enraged, yet I addressed&#xD;
him with a calm voice. 'Mr. Henning,&#xD;
you have disgraced your calling; you have&#xD;
increased the dying agonies of a fellow&#xD;
mortal; and you have fully justified your&#xD;
claim to eternal damnation. Now, sir,&#xD;
if I treated you as you deserve, your in-&#xD;
famy and rascality, would be proclaimed&#xD;
to the world; but I shall only make a&#xD;
slight atonement to the dead, by kicking&#xD;
you down ~ He protested, but seiz-&#xD;
ing him by his white cravat, I adminis-&#xD;
tered half a dozen tremendous applica-&#xD;
tions with my cowhide boots, the last of&#xD;
which sent his reverend body whirling&#xD;
down the staircase. Losing his balance,&#xD;
he bounded from one step to another, un-&#xD;
til he tumbled at last upon the floor, where&#xD;
he lay for several moments, and then&#xD;
rubbing his back with one hand, and his&#xD;
legs with the other, he limped away.~~&#xD;
"And the verdict of the world, would&#xD;
be,' Served him right!' exclaimed Judge&#xD;
Douglass.&#xD;

&#xD;
dates at Bergen passed without any&#xD;
difficulty, and for several~appointme[~ts,&#xD;
Edward flattered himself flu at the canvass&#xD;
would be an agreeable one. He was&#xD;
doomed to disappointment. Macgregor,&#xD;
worsted in argument, resorted to misrepre-&#xD;
sentation, and in the closing speech at&#xD;
Sherwood, he charged his opponent with&#xD;
changing his position upon the tariff, in&#xD;
order to suit different localities. After they&#xD;
had returned to the hotel, Clifton sought&#xD;
an interview with his opponent, and&#xD;
warned him, that he would not submit to&#xD;
misrepresentation. "The reason I call&#xD;
your attention in private, to the injustice&#xD;
which you are doing me," he continued.&#xD;
"is because we are heated while address.&#xD;
ing a crowd. That is no time to settle&#xD;
difficulties, unless it is at the point of the&#xD;
pistol!"&#xD;
"Very well, sir; if you wish to settle it&#xD;
in that way, I am at your service !"&#xD;
"But I do not; I greatly prefer a gentle-&#xD;
manly discussion. You must be aware,&#xD;
nevertheless, how fatal it will be to my&#xD;
prospects, if I suffer you to charge me&#xD;
with advocating principles, to-day, only to&#xD;
repudiate them to-morrow: I might as&#xD;
well abandon the canvass and return&#xD;
home."&#xD;
"I will certainly not oppose that step !"&#xD;
"Probably not; but you shall not force&#xD;
me to it. It was my desire that principles&#xD;
should be discussed, and that personal dif-&#xD;
ficulties should be kept out of the canvass.&#xD;
I have been warned against you. I am&#xD;
prepared for any emergency; you would&#xD;
do well to meet me hereafter with some-&#xD;
thing else hefsides documents, if your&#xD;
misrepresentations of to-day are to be re-&#xD;
peated.~~&#xD;
"I understand you. I always go armed;&#xD;
your advice was unnecessary.&#xD;
The young men separated, with courte-&#xD;
ous expressions, although their forms were&#xD;
trembling ~vith passion.&#xD;
The next day they were to meet near&#xD;
the spot where Macgregor was born, and&#xD;
in the centre of his clan. About a thousand&#xD;
persons had assembled to hear them&#xD;
speak. With the Democratic portion of&#xD;
the crowd, Clifton was very popular, and&#xD;
with any other competitor, there would not&#xD;
have been the slightest doubt of his re-&#xD;
cei~ing the entire vote of his party. But&#xD;
Macgregor was their kinsman and family&#xD;
physician, and was personally very popu-&#xD;
lar. He opened the debate and reiterated&#xD;
his charge of inconsistency against his&#xD;
opponent.&#xD;
"Specify the time and place, as well as&#xD;
&#xD;
the inconsistency of which you speak ?"&#xD;
interrupted Edward.&#xD;
"I will do it, sir. At Bergen you advo-&#xD;
cated a tariff for revenue, with discrimi-&#xD;
natinn for protection. There are several&#xD;
persons here, who heard you avow your-&#xD;
self at Sherwood, yesterday, in favour of a&#xD;
tariff, discriminating in favour of revenue&#xD;
alone?'&#xD;
"Yes, that he did !" exclaimed several&#xD;
of the crowd.&#xD;
After Macgregor concluded, Clifton&#xD;
mounted the stand; but he observed that&#xD;
there was no applause from the Demo-&#xD;
cracy.&#xD;
"I have been accused of inconsistency.&#xD;
If the charge is true, I do not merit your&#xD;
support."&#xD;
"What do you mean, by saying ~f the&#xD;
charge is true ?" exclaimed Macgregor,&#xD;
vehemently. The crowd began to thicken&#xD;
in the vicinity of the stand.&#xD;
"You will require all your coolness, be-&#xD;
fore I get through with you, Doctor.&#xD;
Knowing the high character for which the&#xD;
kinsmen of my opponent are celebrated;&#xD;
it is a painful duty for me~to impeach his&#xD;
honour. I would not have done so, but&#xD;
for the unwarrantable attack which he has&#xD;
made upon nie to-day; I am accused.&#xD;
What is the reputation of my accuser?&#xD;
llitherte~ spotless; but no longer so. I&#xD;
heard recently, that he declared before the&#xD;
nomination of Mr. Clay, that he would&#xD;
vote for no man for the Presidency, who&#xD;
was opposed to the annexation of Texas.&#xD;
Having voted for Mr. Clay, he now vindi-&#xD;
cates his consistency, by denying that he&#xD;
ever made any such declarations. I so&#xD;
understand you, Doctor?"&#xD;
Certainly, sir."&#xD;
"You see, gentlemen, how important&#xD;
it is for his own consistency to remain un-&#xD;
impeached, if his charge against me* is to&#xD;
have any weight. No~v, I hold in my&#xD;
hand the written statement of ten men of&#xD;
unquestionable honour, who swear that he&#xD;
did make the declaration which he now&#xD;
denies."&#xD;
A long pause ensued, while intense&#xD;
silence prevailed throughout the crowd.&#xD;
Macgregor retained his seat, and a deadly&#xD;
pallor overs read his countenance. "Is&#xD;
it possible!'~burst from the lips of his&#xD;
nearest kinsmen. "Gentlemen, after this&#xD;
illustration of my opponent's veracity, I&#xD;
will declare, that the charge which he has&#xD;
made against me to-day, in all its length&#xD;
and breadth, is quite as destitute of truth,&#xD;
as the denial which he has just uttered."&#xD;
Macgregor sprang to his feet,. but his&#xD;
movements were arrested by the authorita-&#xD;
&#xD;
five voice of a leading ~vhig, and a mem-&#xD;
ber of the Presbyterian Church, who ex-&#xD;
claimed, "It is a painful duty for me to&#xD;
impeach the veracity of a relationbut I&#xD;
am forced to it by a regard for truth. I&#xD;
listened with undivided attention to the&#xD;
speeches of Mr. Clifton at Bergen and at&#xD;
Sherwood. The position which he assumed&#xD;
upon the tarifl wa~ forcibly impressed&#xD;
upon my mind, because I believe its&#xD;
adoption ~vilt inflict a fatal blow upon the&#xD;
manufacturers of this country. At both&#xD;
places he advocated a tariff discriminating&#xD;
for revenue alone." As the old man re-&#xD;
sumed his seat, Macgregor drew a pistol,&#xD;
and taking a quick aim at Clifton, fired.&#xD;
The crowd had not only encircled the&#xD;
stan(l, but some of them had mounted it.&#xD;
One of them attempted to strike the&#xD;
xveapori from his hand. but only succeeded&#xD;
in moving it slightly upon one sitle. The&#xD;
ball entered Clifton's shoulder. Rendered&#xD;
furious, the baffled assailant drew a knife,&#xD;
and rushed upon his foe. With the quick-&#xD;
ness of thought, Edward seized his wrist,&#xD;
antI struck him violently upon the mouth&#xD;
with his revolver. The blow knocked&#xD;
several front teeth from their sockets, and&#xD;
hurled Macgregor from the stand, when the&#xD;
combatants ~vere separated.&#xD;
For several weeks after the collision, nei-&#xD;
ther of the candidates addressed the peo-&#xD;
ple. Edward was disabled by his wound,&#xD;
and Macgregor~s articulation was almost&#xD;
destroyed. Still he refused to take the&#xD;
advice of his friends and withdraw from&#xD;
the canvass. In an interview with Clifton&#xD;
he declared his determination not to ac-&#xD;
cuse him of inconsistency again, and&#xD;
asked, as a per~ onal favour, that he would&#xD;
not repeat the pledge which he had given.&#xD;
As our hero was desirous of discussing&#xD;
principles alone, he acceded to the propo-&#xD;
sition, although by doing so, he surren-&#xD;
dered the overwhehniug advantage which&#xD;
the faux pas of his opponent had given&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Before the canvass was ended he was&#xD;
destined to have one more personal diffi-&#xD;
culty. After atten(Iing a list of appoint-&#xD;
ments, he passed one night at Sherwood,&#xD;
on his way to Stamford. Scarcely had he&#xD;
dismounted from his horse, when one of&#xD;
his warmest friends informed him that Dr.&#xD;
Coleman, the whig leader in the county,&#xD;
had inquired if Clifton had not delivered&#xD;
an abolition speech while at College. Ed-&#xD;
ward's feelings were deeply wounded, be-&#xD;
cause he had been upon the most friendly&#xD;
terms with Dr. Coleman. But this emo-&#xD;
tion soon gave place to a feeling of indig-&#xD;
nation. He knew the object of the blow.&#xD;
&#xD;
The next day, as he was proceeding to&#xD;
Stamford, he met Dr. Coleman upon the&#xD;
road. The latter greeted him with the&#xD;
utmost warmth and cordiality. They rode&#xD;
together for several miles, When Clifton&#xD;
charged him with attempting, by infamous&#xD;
means, to injure his popularity, and in-&#xD;
formed him that on the following Monday&#xD;
he should publicly denounce the insinua-&#xD;
tions as false, in Sherwood, where it was&#xD;
made.&#xD;
The court met at Sherwood, and an&#xD;
immense crowd had assembled. It was&#xD;
here that Edward had made his earliest&#xD;
friends, and delivered his first speech, and&#xD;
here he felt a desire to sustain himself&#xD;
triumphantly. In the course of his re-&#xD;
marks, he alluded to the inquiry of Dr.&#xD;
Coleman, and pronounced the charge that&#xD;
he had ever made an abolition speech, or&#xD;
written an abolition letter, that he was&#xD;
now, or ever had been an abolitionist, an&#xD;
unqualified falsehood.&#xD;
After he had concluded, the Doctor made&#xD;
his way through the crowd and&#xD;
rage, mounted the stand. ,livid with&#xD;
"It is strange that the gentleman,~~ he&#xD;
declared, "should become so excited upon&#xD;
the subject. I indignantly repel the charge&#xD;
that I intended to do him injustice; I only&#xD;
made the inquiry as his friend."&#xD;
'' As my friend !" responded Clifton,&#xD;
ironically. "No! as a hidulen, secret,&#xD;
dastardly enemy, you endeavored to stab&#xD;
my reputation. If I had delivered an abo-&#xD;
lition speech when a boy, although I might&#xD;
have been appointed by the presiding&#xD;
officer to advocate that side of the ques-&#xD;
tion, you knew very well it would be fatal&#xD;
Ito my popularity. You thought if there&#xD;
was no foundation for the insinuation, still&#xD;
the poison might silently and secretly de-&#xD;
stroy my reputation. It was an infamous&#xD;
attack upon a stranger, and was rendered&#xD;
doubly dishonourable, because there was&#xD;
a smile upon your face when you were&#xD;
using the poisoned dagger of the assassin.&#xD;
As my friend! After the blow had been&#xD;
inflicted, you met me with the blandness&#xD;
of a friend, and made no allusion to my&#xD;
youthful opinions. A friend warns you in&#xD;
private, a craven-hearted foe assails you&#xD;
in secret. Go, sir! Hitherto you have&#xD;
maintained a high character; now your&#xD;
hypocrisy is unveiled, and you will leave&#xD;
this hall the object of relentless and unmi-&#xD;
tigated scorn."&#xD;
Intense excitement prevailed during this&#xD;
scene, and Clifton noticed the tall and&#xD;
commanding form of Col. Miller among&#xD;
those who thronged the lobby of the court.&#xD;
That gentleman despised Coleman quite&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
as much as he admired Clifton. His eyes&#xD;
flashed, and his form trembled during the&#xD;
controversy. As Edward concluded, and&#xD;
passed the petrified form of the Doctor,&#xD;
Col. Miller exclaimed, "That is enough,&#xD;
gentlemen. That is satisfactory. Three&#xD;
cheers for Edward Clifton!" And the wild,&#xD;
prolonged, aud enthusiastic huzzas shook&#xD;
the building.&#xD;
It was the night preceding the election.&#xD;
Clifton had completed his appointments,&#xD;
and returning to Stamford, threw himself&#xD;
upon his bed almost exhausted. No one&#xD;
can describe the delights of that moment.&#xD;
The labour has been performed, the duties&#xD;
to himself and hi~ party have been dis-&#xD;
charged, and nothing reniains but for the&#xD;
ballot-box to decide the contest.&#xD;
"Let me congratulate you upon the ter-&#xD;
mination of the canvass,~~ said Fielding,&#xD;
as he entered Edward's office.&#xD;
"Thank you; I am glad it is over; the&#xD;
fatigue and excitement is enough to affect&#xD;
the most powerful constitution."&#xD;
"You do not fear the result."&#xD;
"Oh, no! I shall beat Macgregor a&#xD;
thousand ~&#xD;
"Is it possible! why that is more than&#xD;
the party majority in t e district."&#xD;
I know it is. Without any agency of&#xD;
mine, the result of the meeting at Belden's,&#xD;
where he was exposed in the presence of&#xD;
his relations, has been widely circulated.&#xD;
Not only that affair but the collision with&#xD;
Coleman has&#xD;
Porters.~~ld given me many whig sup-&#xD;
not be otherwise. Our citi-&#xD;
zens are magnanimous, and any attempt&#xD;
to crush a person by dishonourable means,&#xD;
will surely recoil. Besides, an influence&#xD;
has been operating in your favour which&#xD;
you least expected.~~&#xD;
"What is that, pray i"&#xD;
"My wife has persuaded her father to&#xD;
vote for you.~~&#xD;
"What! Judge Douglass vote for a&#xD;
democrat! I am under a thousand obli-&#xD;
gations to Mrs. Fielding."&#xD;
"Well, you will soon have an opportu-&#xD;
nity of expressing them, as she intends to&#xD;
give a party in honour of the member&#xD;
elect."&#xD;
The morning of the election dawned&#xD;
fair and cloudless. The entire vote of the&#xD;
two parties was polled. Runners had&#xD;
been selected for the purpose of bringing&#xD;
returns to Stamford by midnight, and the&#xD;
greatest excitement prevailed in the vil-&#xD;
lage. Clifton's office was the head-quar-&#xD;
ters of the democrats; Blanton's for the&#xD;
whigs; and around each several hundred&#xD;
persons had congregated to ascertain the&#xD;
&#xD;
result. As night set in, they had obtained&#xD;
the vote from every precinct in that county&#xD;
except one. Heavy bets had been made&#xD;
that Clifton's majority would be greater than&#xD;
either the candidate for Governor or Sena-&#xD;
tor, and that it would reach three hun-&#xD;
dred and fifty. It was now three hundred&#xD;
and forty, and at the precinct yet to be&#xD;
heard from, the parties at the last election&#xD;
were tied. They were anxiously awaiting&#xD;
the arrival of the courier, and at last the&#xD;
sound of horses' feet was heard, as the&#xD;
rider dashed into the centre of the circle.&#xD;
"Fifteen majority for the Governor, nine-&#xD;
teen for Harden, twenty-four for Clifton !"&#xD;
The welkin rang with cheer after cheer&#xD;
as this result was announced. A profound&#xD;
silence reigned in the vicinity of Blanton's&#xD;
office.&#xD;
As the returns from the other counties&#xD;
had first to be compared at the county-&#xD;
seats, several hours must elapse before&#xD;
they could be received. The crowd broke&#xD;
into knots, the two parties mingled to-&#xD;
gether, and many a good-natured repartee&#xD;
served to while away the hour.&#xD;
"Which county do you expect to hear&#xD;
from next, Mr. Clifton&#xD;
~" What will be the whig majority."&#xD;
"About two huruired."&#xD;
A single shout was heard across the&#xD;
square, followed by loud applause, and&#xD;
then a voice exclaimed,&#xD;
"Whig majority in Madison, two hun-&#xD;
dred and forty-five !"&#xD;
"That is greater than I expected,~~ said&#xD;
Clifton.&#xD;
"What will the democratic majority be&#xD;
in FaulknerV' inquired Fielding.&#xD;
"I am so much disappointed in Madi-&#xD;
son, I can hardly venture to predict," re-&#xD;
sponded Clifton; "I think it cannot, how-&#xD;
ever, be less than three hundred and&#xD;
ninety."&#xD;
The sound of horses' feet was again&#xD;
heard, but this time it came from another&#xD;
direction. It clattered along the bank of&#xD;
the river, was for a moment lost in the&#xD;
glen, and then the steed thundered across&#xD;
the bridge. The next instant, a horse-&#xD;
man, mounted upon a bay charger, from&#xD;
whose sides the sweat poured, threw him-&#xD;
self from the saddle, and, twirling his hat&#xD;
around his head, announced four hundred&#xD;
and sixty-nine democratic majority in&#xD;
Faulkner.&#xD;
The cheering which followed this intel-&#xD;
ligence was long and enthusiastic.&#xD;
"Well done, glorious old Faulkner !"&#xD;
burst from the lips of many a democrat.&#xD;
"What do you think of that, my whig&#xD;
&#xD;
C L IFT ON.&#xD;
&#xD;
friend P exclaimed Fielding, as he slap-&#xD;
ped 'Squire Morris upon the shoulder."&#xD;
"Only that ~ve are as much surprised&#xD;
,as you were a moment ago, by the news&#xD;
from ~&#xD;
"One hundred and forty-five whig ma-&#xD;
jority will be the returns from Henry,~~&#xD;
said Harden.&#xD;
"We ought to have heard from that&#xD;
county before now," said Judge Douglass.&#xD;
"The change in the vote since the last&#xD;
election has probably been very little;&#xD;
they are German, you know."&#xD;
"Whig majority in Henry, one hundred&#xD;
and fifty !"&#xD;
No applause followed this announce-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"How high will our majority range in&#xD;
Cleveland l"&#xD;
"You can judge better than I how that&#xD;
county has gone, Harden."&#xD;
" Your majority will be three hundred&#xD;
and fifty; mine, three hundred."&#xD;
An unusual commotion was heard in&#xD;
the Whig crowd, and a yoice exclaimed:&#xD;
"That's positively awful !"&#xD;
"It must be the returns from Cleveland,&#xD;
and favourable to us."&#xD;
The messenger rode his exhausted&#xD;
horse across the square, and his arrival&#xD;
was welcomed by a joyous shout.&#xD;
"How is itl What is the result~" de-&#xD;
manded the eager questioners.&#xD;
"Majority for Clifton, four hundred and&#xD;
seventy.five.~~&#xD;
"Impossible !" burst from a hundred&#xD;
voices.&#xD;
"True, I assure you."&#xD;
The enthusiasm now became, intense,&#xD;
and the cheers were terrific.&#xD;
"Upwards of a hundred votes more&#xD;
than I gave you.~~&#xD;
"How will it stand in Jefferson, 'Squire&#xD;
Miorris ~&#xD;
"About fifty majority for the whigs."&#xD;
"The messenger is late."&#xD;
"There he comes; and with good news&#xD;
for us," cried Morris, as he darted towards&#xD;
the head-quarters of the whigs. The&#xD;
huzzas in that direction were loud and&#xD;
prolonged. A democrat came over with&#xD;
a dejected countenance.&#xD;
"One hundred and seventy-five&#xD;
'ty for the whigs in Jefferson ~&#xD;
This information came like a cold bath&#xD;
upon the democracy.&#xD;
The only county to be heard from now&#xD;
was Washington. It was forty miles from,&#xD;
Sherwood to Stamford, and another hour&#xD;
must elapse before the runner could arrive.&#xD;
It was now eleven o'clock. The unfavour-&#xD;
able returns from Jefferson made the demo-&#xD;
&#xD;
181&#xD;
&#xD;
crats await with considerable anxiety for&#xD;
the news from Washington. Clifton felt a&#xD;
deeper, because he had a personal, as well&#xD;
a political, interest in the result. Sherwood&#xD;
was his earliest home in the State; it was&#xD;
,there he had made his first political&#xD;
speech; and there Fenton and Dr. Cole-&#xD;
man came rudely in contact with him. It&#xD;
was in the county of Washington that he&#xD;
denounced the unscrupulous conduct of&#xD;
his opponent, in the midst of his kinsmen.&#xD;
It cannot appear strange, then, that his&#xD;
heart beat and his cheek flushed when-&#xD;
ever a shout was raised across the square.&#xD;
He was almost certain of an election; but&#xD;
to the young and ambitious, when the&#xD;
ballot-box has decided their popularity,&#xD;
success alone is not enough. They com-&#xD;
pare with jealous eyes their own vote&#xD;
with that of others upon the same ticket;&#xD;
and a falling off gives quite as much pain&#xD;
as the contrary result does pleasure.&#xD;
It was half an hour past midnight, and&#xD;
both parties began to th ink of dispersing.&#xD;
"This is your last card, Clifton; what&#xD;
will it beV'&#xD;
"I hope my majority will be four hun-&#xD;
dred. I shall be satisfied with that, though&#xD;
I shall not complain if it is not more than&#xD;
three seventy-five. Less than that will&#xD;
disappoint me."&#xD;
"Well, here it comes, good or bad."&#xD;
The notes of a bugle were heard in the&#xD;
distance; as they floated merrily upon the&#xD;
night air.&#xD;
"Tis Frank Place. The news is good !"&#xD;
exclaimed Clifton, in a joyous tone. "It&#xD;
is the signal we agreed upon.~~&#xD;
The pent-up feelings of the crowd gave&#xD;
way at this announcement, and a tremen-&#xD;
dous huzza was borne to the ears of the&#xD;
sta~tled Whigs. To increase the enthusi-&#xD;
asm, a brass band commenced playing.&#xD;
In a few minutes a foaming steed&#xD;
bounded into the midst of the immense&#xD;
throng, and, rising in his stirrups, the horse-&#xD;
man proposed three cheers for Clifton.&#xD;
They were given, and, as the last huzza&#xD;
floated away upon the breeze, a profound&#xD;
silence fell upon the multitude.&#xD;
"Democratic majority for Governor,&#xD;
four hundred and twelve; for Senator,&#xD;
four hundred and one; for Congressman,&#xD;
six hundred and ninety.five I"&#xD;
It is impossible to describe the delirium&#xD;
which, for a few minutes held possession&#xD;
of the crowd. At length it took the form&#xD;
of action. Rushing forward, they seized&#xD;
Clifton, and in spite of his protestations&#xD;
mounted him upon their shoulders, and&#xD;
bore him in triumph around the square.&#xD;

CONTINUATION OF ALICE HOWARD'S JOURNAL.&#xD;
"JUNE, 1845.-I have just been informed&#xD;
by my mother, that father exacted a pro.&#xD;
mise from Mr. Clifton, not to address me&#xD;
until six years had elapsed. He counted&#xD;
upon the instability of human affections!&#xD;
So far as lam concernedhow fatal was&#xD;
t~ie opinion? Perhaps not so with Ed-&#xD;
ward; he may have forgotten me, and the&#xD;
heart's youngest, freshest, purest emotions,&#xD;
may be wasted upon a person, whose&#xD;
fidelity exists only in my imagination.&#xD;
Within seven months~ I shall know my&#xD;
destiny! Six years will then be numbered&#xD;
with the past, and his word will be kept&#xD;
inviolate. If other scenes have changed&#xD;
the current of his affection, a remorseless&#xD;
doom is mine! It is terrible to stake the&#xD;
happiness of a life upon the uncertain&#xD;
fidelity of man. And yet it is fate which&#xD;
controls us. The heart, it is true, may&#xD;
be kept under the iron rule of the brai{i!&#xD;
But it is the sway of the despot, which&#xD;
crushes while it restrains. Still I do not&#xD;
despair, for I have a consciousness of&#xD;
power that can brook no rival. Why&#xD;
should I? The mirror bids me hope!&#xD;
"Iii a week I start for Newport. Hith-&#xD;
ertp my visits to the ocean have been con-&#xD;
fined to Cape May and Long Branch. The&#xD;
company at the former place is too pro-&#xD;
miscuous; the crowd is too great. At&#xD;
Long Branch, there is not enough variety.&#xD;
The visitors are nearly all Philadelphians.&#xD;
But at Newport are congregated the grave&#xD;
and the gay from all parts of the Union.&#xD;
They shine by contrast. I shall pass some&#xD;
time in New York, and then proceed in&#xD;
the Bay State, to Newport; a summer&#xD;
there, an autumn here, and a winter in&#xD;
&#xD;
T 0 N.&#xD;
&#xD;
Washington. That is a programme to&#xD;
satisfy the most exacting.&#xD;
"New York, June, 1845.-Here I am&#xD;
at the Astor House. Several friends were&#xD;
anxious for me to take up my abode at&#xD;
their houses, but I prefer remaining here.&#xD;
Although the fashionable e~ have not yet&#xD;
taken their flight to the su\ nier resorts,&#xD;
still they are preparing to do so. It is too&#xD;
late for parties, though receptions have&#xD;
not been altogether discontinued. The&#xD;
custom ofhaving evening receptions is an&#xD;
excellent one5 else the visiting would de-&#xD;
generate into formality. Ladies often ex-&#xD;
change calls through an entire season&#xD;
without meeting, and at last they become&#xD;
the creatures of ceremony, with no warmth,&#xD;
and scarcely any social vitality. I have&#xD;
often been amused, when they accidentally&#xD;
meet; unmeaning compliments,~ and for-&#xD;
mal ceremony mark the interview, and&#xD;
they separate without any impression hav-&#xD;
ing been made by either, save that which&#xD;
a faultless, or vulgar dress; graceful, or&#xD;
common manners, may have produced.&#xD;
The exit of the visitor does riot call forth&#xD;
warm commendations upon her frank, and&#xD;
yet lady-like deportment. It is too often fo[-&#xD;
lowed by a process which a Baltimore&#xD;
girl called 'picking to pieces,' something&#xD;
in the following style.&#xD;
"'Did you ever see such a frightful hat?&#xD;
Velvet, with a sixpenny rose on each side.&#xD;
And, then, what a funny expression! She&#xD;
a gentleman wore his hat on the&#xD;
back side of his head!'&#xD;
"'Upon my word, yes.'&#xD;
"~ And yet she was educated at Ma-&#xD;
dame -,&#xD;
"It is far different at a reception where&#xD;
forms are laid aside with your hood and&#xD;
cloak. Then pride and formality are for&#xD;
the hour unlaced, and cheerfulness and&#xD;
gaiety preside over the festive scene.&#xD;
Friends who are brought together upon&#xD;
such occasions, are afforded the only re-&#xD;
laxation from the stifihess of New York&#xD;
society. Morning calls are governed by&#xD;
the iron rules of etiquette. Parties are&#xD;
made the occasion for display, and no-&#xD;
thing else. The exhibition of your own&#xD;
jewelry and brocade, and a mental inven-&#xD;
tory of the ornaments with which the per-&#xD;
sons of your friends are decorated, make&#xD;
a sad inroad upon agreeability. If you.&#xD;
chance to have a daughter in the room,&#xD;
anxiety, because she may not have so&#xD;
many beaux as she ought, is superadded&#xD;
to your other cares, and renders your stu-&#xD;
pidity profound. By the way, how ridi-&#xD;
culous some mothers do make themselves&#xD;
at parties. If their darlings do not receive&#xD;
&#xD;
C LI F&#xD;
&#xD;
as much attention as they desire, it puts&#xD;
them at once into a fever of excitement.&#xD;
They gaze with intense earnestness at&#xD;
every male acquaintance who passes, and,&#xD;
if he eludes them, their disappointment is&#xD;
truly laughable. There is absolute terror&#xD;
in the idea of becoming a ' wall-flower;'&#xD;
and, to avoid it, all sorts of attention is&#xD;
shown to the most unworthy specimens of&#xD;
chivalry. It makes very little difference&#xD;
how vulgar the manners, or revolting the&#xD;
person, so he fills a pair of pantaloons and&#xD;
dances the polka. He may wear a vile&#xD;
mustache and have the most abominable&#xD;
breath, it is all endurable, provided he&#xD;
dances the polka. But just think of it.&#xD;
It is not enough that all this is to be&#xD;
endured, but you must be polite and at-&#xD;
tentive to the vagabonds. A few nights&#xD;
ago, a young lady had been playing the&#xD;
agreeable to a most insufferable coxcomb,&#xD;
whose spindle limbs and effeminate coun-&#xD;
tenance proved him one of the rarest spe-&#xD;
cimens of New York beaux. After he&#xD;
had withdrawn, she remarked, sotto voce,&#xD;
'After that, he can't refuse to ask me to&#xD;
dance.' Young ladies, who have a for-&#xD;
tune in their own possession, or are blessed&#xD;
with great expectations, have plenty of&#xD;
beaux for the dance. They are relieved&#xD;
of much annoyance. Why it is that be-&#xD;
ing constantly upon the floor is considered&#xD;
so very desirable, I cannot tell. But it is,&#xD;
and some of our sex will have partners&#xD;
even if it occasions a loss of self-respect.&#xD;
And good dancers are in great demand.&#xD;
Not long since, I saw a fond mother&#xD;
watching, with admiring eyes, the floating&#xD;
form of her daughter as she whirled&#xD;
through the waltz. She whispered to the&#xD;
person who was seated next her, 'How&#xD;
important it is for a young lady to have a&#xD;
partner who dances well.' I know the&#xD;
young lady, and I thought 'how important&#xD;
it is that the head should be cultivated as&#xD;
well as the heels.' And yet, strange to&#xD;
say, they depend more upon the accom-&#xD;
plishments of ~he ball-room, than the&#xD;
study, to win admiration, if not a husband.&#xD;
"I have notthe greatest opinion of schools&#xD;
in New York. Perhaps some of them&#xD;
may be as good as any in the Union, yet&#xD;
there are several that rank very high for&#xD;
~vhich I have not much respect. With&#xD;
the semblance of great strictness and se-&#xD;
verity, the discipline which enforces appli-&#xD;
cation is exceedingly lax. Parents send&#xD;
their children to school for improvement,&#xD;
and not to become the victims of tyranny.&#xD;
There is one institution of very high repu-&#xD;
tation, where several of my acquaintances&#xD;
have been educated, whose proprietress&#xD;
&#xD;
TON.                           188&#xD;
has tendered herself obnoxious by her&#xD;
overbearing disposition. It has been often&#xD;
proved that young ladies, as well as young&#xD;
gentlemen, can be governed by kindness&#xD;
much better than by harshness. But the&#xD;
principal of whom I speak, probably em-&#xD;
bittered by an event that forced her into a&#xD;
position greatly inferior to the one which&#xD;
Nature had qualified her to adorn (although&#xD;
she could have exercised no possible con-&#xD;
trol over it), vented her savage humour&#xD;
upon her defeaceless pupils. A proud&#xD;
spirit was continually warring against its&#xD;
fate, until all who are more fortunate, be-&#xD;
come the objects of its fury. To mortify&#xD;
and disappoint those who are placed under&#xD;
her temporary charge, seems to be the ob-&#xD;
ject of her existence. Instead of en-&#xD;
couraging them by kindness and gentle&#xD;
words to surmount the difficulties in the&#xD;
path of education, she constantly throws&#xD;
obstacles in their way, by irritating their&#xD;
temper, thwarting their reasonable de-&#xD;
sires, and turniri'g those who would love&#xD;
and obey her into relentless foes. She&#xD;
arouses the worst passions of the human&#xD;
heart-hate and the desire for revenge.&#xD;
The whole system is illustrated by the ex-&#xD;
perience of a young lady from the South&#xD;
who came on with her relation to attend&#xD;
the institution. XVhile her sister remained,&#xD;
the proprietress was all affability and&#xD;
kindness. *It was, 'My dear, ~vill you&#xD;
have this? my dear, will you do that?'&#xD;
until, at length, the maiden would have&#xD;
defended the old lady against every as-&#xD;
sault. A week had iiot elapsed after her&#xD;
sister returned, before there ~vas a gradual&#xD;
change. Going one evening to ask a&#xD;
question, she was saluted with the sharp&#xD;
inquiry, 'What do you want, Miss?'&#xD;
Instead of love and willing obedience, she&#xD;
has inspired fear and dislike.'&#xD;
"But she will say, that severity is abso-&#xD;
lutely necessary to enforce order. That&#xD;
plea is simply untrue. The contrary has&#xD;
been too often demonstrated. Affection is&#xD;
a far more powerful agency in the ma-&#xD;
nagement of the young as well as old. All&#xD;
despotisms are odious, whether nations&#xD;
or individuals are the victims. To be&#xD;
released from oppression, is the cease-&#xD;
less desire of the sufferers, and for the&#xD;
accomplishment of that object, they will&#xD;
devote time which otherwise would be&#xD;
employed in mental improvement. A&#xD;
parent who p laces his daughter, in the&#xD;
school of Madame -, expects to have&#xD;
her prepared for that circle in which he&#xD;
moves himself. When he trusts her, to&#xD;
the savage rule of Madame , she is a&#xD;
tender, sensitive flower, upon whose&#xD;

&#xD;
cheek the winds of heaven have never&#xD;
blown too roughly, all submission, all love.&#xD;
How is her nature changed by the tigress&#xD;
into whose clutches she has been thrown.&#xD;
Her dail food would disgrace the mess-&#xD;
room       lower deck. that the claims&#xD;
of avarice may be gratified. The victim of&#xD;
harshness first weeps, and many a night is&#xD;
her pillow saturated with tears. Obstinacy&#xD;
succeeds, and at last, an insensibility to&#xD;
either punishment or reproof. While young,&#xD;
she becomes hardened, and at length the&#xD;
punishment of being put to bed, in a dark&#xD;
mom, for twenty-four, sometimes, for thir-&#xD;
ty-six hours, only calls into action those&#xD;
passions of the human heart, which oth-&#xD;
erwise would have remained dormant.&#xD;
What are the thoughts whit~h occupy the&#xD;
teeming brain, during those long dreary&#xD;
hours of solitude ~ Hatred, and a thirst for&#xD;
revenge. Her noble impulses undergo a&#xD;
transition, the sweetness of her disposition&#xD;
is turned to gall; the heart, where love&#xD;
held dominion, is bruised and lacerated.&#xD;
She at last escapes from this worse than&#xD;
Southern bondage, but how changed~ The&#xD;
dungeon is unlocked, but the effects of&#xD;
tyranny cling to the victim, long after the&#xD;
harsh voice ceases to fall upon the ear.&#xD;
The maledictions of outraged humanity&#xD;
will pursue the fiendish tyrant to her last&#xD;
home: and the grave which holds the form,&#xD;
that living, was as remorseless as itself&#xD;
will never be hallowed by a tear.&#xD;
"And yet, Madame -,is truculent, as&#xD;
all tyrants are; she knows the importance&#xD;
of having at least one lady in each class&#xD;
graduate with high honours. That one&#xD;
is often as inlperious as herself. A few&#xD;
explosions of temper, such as dashing&#xD;
books upon the floor, breaking slates, de-&#xD;
claring that she won't be treated so, she&#xD;
will leave the school first, soon causes the&#xD;
proprietress to temporise, and at last to sub-&#xD;
mit. So bright an ornament must not be&#xD;
lost. But her pent-up rage is visited upon&#xD;
the heads~f those whose expulsion from&#xD;
school would be no loss.&#xD;
"I never come to New York, without&#xD;
being amused at the fantastic operations&#xD;
of cliqueism. There are at least half a&#xD;
dozen sets that assume the leadership of&#xD;
fashion, and probably one is just as much&#xD;
entitled to it as another; each think the&#xD;
rest are made up of a mixed set, and the&#xD;
latter have precisely the same opinion of&#xD;
the former. Mrs. Linton inquired if the&#xD;
company at Mrs. Blanckton's was not ex-&#xD;
cessively mixed. Mrs. Fondling replied,&#xD;
that she did not discover it. 'Why, 1 under-&#xD;
stood,' observed Mrs. Linton, 'that the&#xD;
Ferdinands were there.' A few days after&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. Ferdinand asked Mrs. Fondling if&#xD;
the company at the Mantons was not ex-&#xD;
ceedingly mixed. 'I did not perceive it,'&#xD;
replied Mrs. Fondling. 'Why, I heard the&#xD;
Linton~ were there,' said Mrs. Ferdinand.&#xD;
If I believed all that one clique said in&#xD;
praise of themselves and in condemnation&#xD;
of the remainder, I should have an exalted&#xD;
opinion of one, and a moderate estimation&#xD;
of the other.&#xD;
"Taste in dress is also a fruitful source&#xD;
of amusement to me. The judgment of&#xD;
individuals is considered faultless by-&#xD;
themselves. Sweeping and wholesale con-&#xD;
demnation is visited upon the style of dress&#xD;
which the wearer considers the height of&#xD;
fashion. The possessor regards her robe&#xD;
with unmistakable satisfaction, while her&#xD;
neighbour views it with spiteful contempt.&#xD;
If each person who claims the possession&#xD;
of exquisite taste was to be made our&#xD;
model, our dresses would change much&#xD;
oftener than the seasons. The~occupant&#xD;
of a mansion in Fifth Avenue has her style;&#xD;
the one in Fourteenth Street has another;&#xD;
~Mrs. Slaughter, of Union Place, has a&#xD;
fourth; the Bowery girl a fifth, and the&#xD;
tenant of East Broadway a sixth. After&#xD;
all, it depends quite as much upon their&#xD;
dressmakers as their own taste. Locality&#xD;
has a greater influence upon taste and&#xD;
fashion than one would suppose. The in-&#xD;
habitants of a dwelling in East Broadway&#xD;
move in altogether a different circle front&#xD;
the Westenders. They rarely enter the&#xD;
opera house; because Niblo's or the Broad-&#xD;
way is the extent of their ambition. They&#xD;
do not attend balls at Tammany Hall, but&#xD;
they give unostentatious parties at home.&#xD;
The young ladies grow up, marry, and&#xD;
pass a life in that quiet, unambitious&#xD;
sphere. Suppose their lot had been cast&#xD;
in a fashionable street, their career would&#xD;
have been far different. A box at the&#xD;
opera, a bill at Stewarts, a summer at Sa-&#xD;
ratoga, tickets for the fancy ball at the&#xD;
opera house, satins, brocades, diamonds;&#xD;
everything which wealth can command&#xD;
would scarcely satisfy them. These same&#xD;
dashing belles, under other circumstances,&#xD;
might have been struggling for pre-emi-&#xD;
nence at Tammany Hall, or the Apollo&#xD;
Rooms. Locality is everything. These&#xD;
would be unpalatable truths to those who&#xD;
claim the leadership of fashion by inherent&#xD;
right.*&#xD;
"Newport, August, 1845.-I have been&#xD;
* The author would remark, that the fair Philadel-&#xD;
phian is not wholly exempt from those prejudices&#xD;
which are entertained by the inhabitants of Boston,&#xD;
Baltimore, and the city of rectangular streets. There&#xD;
is not a stricture which she has made, that will not&#xD;
apply with quite as much force to Moyamensing and&#xD;
&#xD;
CLI F&#xD;
&#xD;
here almost one month. How rapidly the&#xD;
time passes. I breakfast at nine o~c~ ock,&#xD;
remain at the ten pin alley an hour, dance&#xD;
until eleven, bathe in the surf till twelve,&#xD;
dress and dine at two, and promenade the&#xD;
hall for an hour. Then ride to the tea&#xD;
house, or walk to the cliffs~ return for tea&#xD;
at seven, and dance until midnight. It is&#xD;
a mystery how well the ladies stand this&#xD;
dissipat~in; probably they would sink&#xD;
under it, were it not for sea-bathing and&#xD;
exercise upon horseback.&#xD;
w"'~tiqueism attempted to gain.an ascen-&#xD;
dency at first, but its prurient demands&#xD;
were put down in a summary manner. A&#xD;
family from New York, with a common&#xD;
name and low extraction, had surrounded&#xD;
itself with obsequious beaux, who claimed&#xD;
the right of controlling the music, and giv-&#xD;
ing direction to the dance. This was the&#xD;
more insufferable, because they had&#xD;
learned some fancy dances which were&#xD;
unknown to the other guests. In a public&#xD;
hotel, no clique has a right to monopolize&#xD;
the amusements. If their enjoyment de-&#xD;
pends upon a particular routir~e of plea-&#xD;
sures with which the rest of the company&#xD;
are unfamiliar, they must either seek a&#xD;
cottage or obtain a private parlour. To&#xD;
expect all the other guests to become spec-&#xD;
tators, while a dozen persons float through&#xD;
the mazes of an intricate cotillion, is alto-&#xD;
gether too unreasonable. So thought a&#xD;
spirited lady from Alabama, who, not so&#xD;
exclusive, became the centre of a large&#xD;
and admiring circle. She sought every&#xD;
opportunity of thwarting the plans and&#xD;
scouting the pretensions of this set, and&#xD;
succeeded so admirably that they shrank&#xD;
into the narrow position for which nature&#xD;
had really intended them. The male por-&#xD;
tion of the clique, who always exact until&#xD;
resistance is offered, meeting with a sharp&#xD;
rebuff from a knot of navy officers, also&#xD;
moderated their pretensions.&#xD;
"It is inconceivable how anxious some&#xD;
ladies are to see their names in the columns&#xD;
of a newspaper. To be heralded as the&#xD;
belle of Newport, is the object of their&#xD;
daily, hourly thoughts; and they submit to&#xD;
the companionship of men who are low in&#xD;
character and common in manners, simply&#xD;
because they are correspondents of the&#xD;
public press. It seems to me that a mo-&#xD;
dest lady would shrink from, rather than&#xD;
court, this publicity. It is a notoriety&#xD;
which will not improve their reputations,&#xD;
or assist them to obtain desirable husbands.&#xD;

the vulgar of that city.&#xD;

ALICE HOWARD returned to Philadelphia,&#xD;
and week after week passed away, until&#xD;
the changeable weather of November was&#xD;
about to succeed the clear skies and re-&#xD;
freshing atmosphere of October. The&#xD;
form of the maiden had now acquired&#xD;
that transcendent loveliness, which ren-&#xD;
dered her so beautiful. She was above&#xD;
the medium height, and the form, full, and&#xD;
flowing in its outlines, possessed the most&#xD;
perfect grace and flexibility. Her taper-&#xD;
ing arms were round, and white as mar-&#xD;
ble, and the hands and feet were smell&#xD;
and exquisitely formed. The head, face;&#xD;
neck, and shoulders more than realized&#xD;
the promise of childhood. Her hair when&#xD;
dishevelled, almost reached the floor.&#xD;
Her eyes were large, bright and expres-&#xD;
sive, and her pearly teeth contrasted&#xD;
beautifully with the rosy, pouting lips.&#xD;
She possessed that charming naiveti and&#xD;
grace, without which no one can lay&#xD;
claim to preeminent loveliness.&#xD;
It was with a heart throbbing with wild&#xD;
excitement that Edward Clifton traversed&#xD;
the street in the direction of Mrs. Howard's.&#xD;
His hopes were about to be crowned with&#xD;
happiness or forever destroyed. Atlength&#xD;
he approached tile dwelling. His mind&#xD;
was filled with anxiety when he descended&#xD;
those marble steps six years ago, and now&#xD;
as he ascended them once more, his brain&#xD;
whirled with contending emotions. The&#xD;
scenes through which he had passed,&#xD;
since the hour when that door closed&#xD;
upon his hopes, were startliwv and event-&#xD;
ful~ still, with the lightning s quickness&#xD;
they flashed through his mind. Time&#xD;
seemed annihilated, and in the excite-&#xD;
ment of the moment, ~t appeared as&#xD;

though he was turning upon his footsteps,&#xD;
to obtain a renunciation of that decree&#xD;
which banished him from the presence of&#xD;
Alice.&#xD;
But the ha~iucination was gone, as a&#xD;
strange countenance answered the signal&#xD;
of the bell. Appalled by his anxious&#xD;
look, and tremulous v~ice, the girl did&#xD;
not, on the instant, answer his inquiry&#xD;
for Miss Howard. An age of agony was&#xD;
crowded into that moment of hesitation,&#xD;
and the thought sunk like k~ upon' his&#xD;
heart, "She is dead; or, what is far more&#xD;
horrible, she is married.'' The object for&#xD;
which he had struggled for six long years&#xD;
was now beyond his grasp.&#xD;
"Heard you not !~ he exclaimed almost&#xD;
fiercely. "I inquired if Miss Howard is at&#xD;
home."&#xD;
"I will see, sir; walk in." In after&#xD;
years memory would recall the overpower-&#xD;
ing sweetness of those words. They were&#xD;
simple and commonplace, but they lifted&#xD;
a terrible doubt from his oppressed heart.&#xD;
The object of his adoration was living;&#xD;
was still unmarried.&#xD;
"What name shall I mention 3" inquired&#xD;
the maid.&#xD;
"Say that an old friend desires to see&#xD;
her." Clifton cast his eyes around the&#xD;
room. A faithful memory claimed each&#xD;
painting which hung upon the wall, as an&#xD;
old acquaintance. The same fire appeared&#xD;
to burn in the grate, the piano stood&#xD;
where he last saw it. A guitar leaned&#xD;
against the sofa, as though the strings had&#xD;
just been touched, and a volume of Scott's&#xD;
novels was lying open upon the centre-&#xD;
table.&#xD;
Scarcely had he made these observa-&#xD;
tions, when the parlour door moved upon&#xD;
its hinges, the rustling of silk was heard,&#xD;
and a graceful form stood before him. For&#xD;
a moment they gazed at each other with&#xD;
overpowering intensity.&#xD;
'Thank God, you have at last returned !"&#xD;
burst from the lips of the maiden, as she&#xD;
staggered forward, and fell into the arms&#xD;
of her lover.&#xD;
Those words, " at ~ revealed the&#xD;
deep; exhaustless well of her affections.&#xD;
Silently Edward embraced the form of the&#xD;
beautiful girl. His joy was too big for&#xD;
words. He gazed upon every lineament&#xD;
of her face, arid traced the development&#xD;
of those beauties which even in childhood&#xD;
were so rare and promising. His feelings&#xD;
were overcome with gratitude, and the&#xD;
tears coursed each other down his cheeks.&#xD;
Her eyes were closed, but her heart beat&#xD;
wildly, against his own. The lips were&#xD;
&#xD;
TON.&#xD;
&#xD;
slightly parted, and her fragrant breath&#xD;
played upon his cheek.&#xD;
~ Dearest Alice, shall we ever part&#xD;
again 3"&#xD;
Her eyes enclosed, and she answered&#xD;
his inquiry with a look of unutterable ten-&#xD;
derness, while the arm which encircled&#xD;
his neck dre~v her form still closer to his&#xD;
own. Their lips met in a long, lingering&#xD;
kiss, in which was pledged an eternity of&#xD;
love and fidelity.&#xD;
IC Why have you kept me in suspense.&#xD;
for six long years 3" inquired Alice, as she&#xD;
gently withdrew from his arms.&#xD;
"In an evil hour I gave my word of&#xD;
honour to your father, not to address you&#xD;
until the present time. However much I&#xD;
regretted the obstacle which interfered with&#xD;
my hopes, I had no resource but to await&#xD;
the hour which was to emancipate me."&#xD;
" And what assurance had you, dearest&#xD;
Edward, that I would not wed another?"&#xD;
"None whatever, and hence the horrible&#xD;
doubts with which I was often agonized."&#xD;
"You have reason to be thankful, for it&#xD;
is not often that a maiden yields her&#xD;
affections unsolicited to the keeping of&#xD;
another."&#xD;
"You 'ought nct to say unsolicited, for&#xD;
although I did riot r~vow my attachment&#xD;
in words, still you could not have been&#xD;
ignorant of its existence."&#xD;
"And pray, how was a girl of fourteen&#xD;
to divine your thoughts 3,'&#xD;
"Females understand the language of&#xD;
admiration at a very early age. Did you&#xD;
not know the state of my feelings?"&#xD;
"Yes; and it was that knowledge which&#xD;
kept my heart true to its allegiance. But&#xD;
I am so glad you are with me again !" and&#xD;
the girl pressed his hand fondly between&#xD;
her own.&#xD;
"I learned the death of your father&#xD;
through the newspapers, and although I&#xD;
deeply sympathized with you, still my&#xD;
condolence could not reach your ears.&#xD;
Ah, me! a hard fate has been ours. But&#xD;
Fortune has done her worst, and in giving&#xD;
me your heart and hand, she compensates&#xD;
me for many an hour of suffering and&#xD;
woe.~~&#xD;
We will not take the liberty of an author,&#xD;
and reveal more of the conversation. Those&#xD;
who have enjoyed the ecstatic bliss, which&#xD;
an assurance of possession, at no distant&#xD;
day, never fails to confer, can imagine all&#xD;
that it becomes us to conceal. Suffice it&#xD;
to say, that before the interview closed,&#xD;
the wedding day was fixed for the 28th&#xD;
of December, so importunate was the&#xD;
lover, after his hopes had been so long&#xD;
deferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
CLIF&#xD;
&#xD;
CC You will call at nine o'clock, and ac-&#xD;
company me to the party," said Alice, as&#xD;
Clifton stood at the parlour door, with his&#xD;
arm round her waist.&#xD;
"Certainly, if you wish to go."&#xD;
"I have already accepted the invitation,&#xD;
and Miss Everton is a warm friend. Be-&#xD;
sides, I want to display my Congressional&#xD;
beau,~~ and she surveyed his manly form&#xD;
and handsome face with a look of pride.&#xD;
"I will not fail you, then."&#xD;
One kiss, one embracee, and they parted.&#xD;
At the hour appointed, Edward entered&#xD;
the parlour. Mrs. Howard was there to&#xD;
receive hinxi{er welcome was warm&#xD;
and affectionate. In afew minutes Alice&#xD;
came in, robed in a white embroidered&#xD;
silk. Her luxuriant hair was tastefully&#xD;
arranged, and sufficiently ornamented her&#xD;
head, without the aid of flowers or jewels.&#xD;
A large diamond pin sparkled upon her&#xD;
bosom. Her Norman feet were encased&#xD;
in white satin slippers, and her exquisitely&#xD;
moulded arms were naked half way from&#xD;
the elbow to the shoulders. Happiness&#xD;
beamed in her expressive eyes, for her&#xD;
heart was full to overflowing.&#xD;
CC How well you look to-night, Alice."&#xD;
"Thank you, dear mother, I feel so."&#xD;
Ed~vard did not express his admiration&#xD;
in words, but with a woman's discernment&#xD;
she saw it all. He was certain that he had&#xD;
never looked upon a being half so beau-&#xD;
tiful before. Love is gifted with a strange,&#xD;
magical power, in the first moments of his&#xD;
ascendency. Not only does the god sur-&#xD;
round the object of your idolatry with in-&#xD;
expressible charms, but he gilds every-&#xD;
thing perceptible to the senses with the&#xD;
tints of happiness.&#xD;
"Is the carriage at the door, mother 3"&#xD;
"Not yet.~&#xD;
"I have one there," said Clifton.&#xD;
Cl Our own will soon be here. We never&#xD;
enter a public carriage, since a friend of&#xD;
mine caught the small-pox in one. You&#xD;
had better discharge yours. Will you&#xD;
button this glove, M~. Clifton. Have I not&#xD;
grown siuce you, rescued me from that&#xD;
frightful lake 3"&#xD;
"Yes, chnrming.~~&#xD;
"Hush! you must not flatter me."&#xD;
"It is the truth, and that is to be spoken&#xD;
at all times. Why this glove is marked&#xD;
number six, is it possible you can get it&#xD;
on 3"&#xD;
"Yes; that is the number, I always&#xD;
wear. Good night, ma! do not wait up&#xD;
for me."&#xD;
"Mr. Clifton, it will be ~o late when&#xD;

and I promised a friend to meet him there&#xD;
early in the morning."&#xD;
They entered a carriage lined with&#xD;
orange-coloured damask. It was odd,&#xD;
but as they approached the house, whose&#xD;
illuminated windows indicated it as the&#xD;
one where the party was given. Miss&#xD;
Howard asked her companion to button&#xD;
her glove again.&#xD;
The company had nearly all assembled&#xD;
when they entered. The rooms were&#xD;
crowded with the beauty and fashion of&#xD;
Philadelphia, and there was scarcely space&#xD;
for the dancers. Many a bright pair of&#xD;
eyes were turned upon our hero, as he was&#xD;
presented to the hostess by Miss Howard.&#xD;
"Who can he be 3" whispered Mary&#xD;
Jone~ to her beau.&#xD;
"I cannot tell; I think he is a Southemer,&#xD;
if I may judge from his manner and com-&#xD;
plecion."&#xD;
"Probably she picked him up at New-&#xD;
port."&#xD;
"Poor fellow! he will fare no better&#xD;
than the rest of them."&#xD;
"The rest of us, you ought to say, Mr.&#xD;
Meredith."&#xD;
"Nonsense! I was not an admirer of&#xD;
the haughty beauty."&#xD;
"If you were not, rumour was unjust.&#xD;
However, I never knew a gentleman ~vho&#xD;
was willing to acknowledge that he had&#xD;
been rejected. Why, I cannot tell. It&#xD;
surely is no disgrace to manifest a prefe-&#xD;
rence for a young and lovely woman. And&#xD;
so you think Alice will add him to the&#xD;
long list of her conquests, only to reject&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
"I am not so certain of it," replied her&#xD;
companion, who had been watching the&#xD;
movements of Miss Howard with so much&#xD;
interest that he only heard the last obser-&#xD;
vation of Miss Jones.&#xD;
"You do nQt think he is an accepted&#xD;
lover 3"&#xD;
"It is difficult to tell; though I have&#xD;
never seen Alice Howard bend her haughty&#xD;
neck so graciously before. And see, what&#xD;
volumes of love are revealed by her elo-&#xD;
quent eyes, as she raises them for fleeting&#xD;
moments to his own. The heightened&#xD;
colour; the arm which rests with greater&#xD;
weight than usual upon that of her com-&#xD;
panion; the rapt attention when he&#xD;
breathes his low words into her ear; oh,&#xD;
it is unmistakably a match !" and the&#xD;
fierceness with which he concluded his&#xD;
remarks, proved the intensity of his feel-&#xD;
ings.&#xD;
"Where could she have met him ~ he&#xD;

continued, musingly. "I am certain he&#xD;
was not at Newport last summer. Miss&#xD;
Jones, Alice is a friend of yours; can't you&#xD;
tell me where she met this gallant V'&#xD;
"Since you feel so much interested-.al-&#xD;
though you never did address her-it is&#xD;
strange you have forgotten, that when a&#xD;
mere child she was saTed from drowning&#xD;
by the intrepidity of a youth whose name&#xD;
was Edward Clifton."&#xD;
"I know; but her father, who was an&#xD;
abolitionist, forbid his attentions, because&#xD;
young Clifton defended the peculiar in-&#xD;
stitutions of the South."&#xD;
"That is true: but Alice was neither&#xD;
an abolitionist nor ungrateful, and I think&#xD;
it will turn out that this gentleman&#xD;
is Edward Clifton, a young member of&#xD;
Congress elect."&#xD;
Yes; I heard her introduce him as&#xD;
Mr. Clifton."&#xD;
"Then you, and all other colflpetitQrs,&#xD;
may hang your harps upon the willow. Is&#xD;
he not young to be elevated to so high a&#xD;
position ~"&#xD;
"He is scarcely more than eligible,&#xD;
and will be the youngest member in the&#xD;
Hbuse."&#xD;
It was soon whispered through the room&#xD;
th our hero was the accepted lover of&#xD;
Howard, and a rising young states-&#xD;
an. Introductions succeeded, until they&#xD;
became the centre of a large circle.&#xD;
Finding himself a lion, where he expected&#xD;
to act an humble part, Clifton called into&#xD;
requisition his brilliant conversational&#xD;
powers. Alice hung upon his words with&#xD;
delight, and her heart overflowed with&#xD;
thankfulness that her lover was so worthy&#xD;
of that priceless affection which she had&#xD;
so freely bestowed.&#xD;
It was past midnight when they again&#xD;
entered the carriage. Alice no longer&#xD;
cared if her hair was disarranged; and as&#xD;
his arm encircled her zone, and drew her&#xD;
yielding form to his bosom, her head&#xD;
rested upon his shoulder with a fond and&#xD;
graceful abandon.&#xD;

SCOTT.&#xD;
AFTER remaining a few week in Phila-&#xD;
delphia, Clifton proceeded to Wa~ington&#xD;
to take his seat in the House of Represen-&#xD;
tatives. There is no place where the im-&#xD;
mensity of the Union is so forcibly illustra-&#xD;
ted as in that celebrated hall. Not only&#xD;
each State, but each Congressional district&#xD;
has its representative, and the speaker&#xD;
may at one minute recognize a member&#xD;
whose door opens upon the tumultuous&#xD;
waves of the Atlantic, and the next, one&#xD;
whose window looks out upon the tranquil&#xD;
waters of the Pacific Ocean. Congregated&#xD;
beneath its lofty dome are those into&#xD;
whose hands are placed the fiat of peace&#xD;
or war; the prosperity or destruction of&#xD;
this glorious confederacy.&#xD;
Hon. John W. Davis, of Indian awas&#xD;
nominated by the democratic members&#xD;
for the Speakership, and was elected with-&#xD;
out serious opposition. There were quite&#xD;
forty majority for the Democratic party in&#xD;
the House, but it was not a majority that&#xD;
could be safely relied upon; there were&#xD;
too many conflicting interests to divide&#xD;
and distract.&#xD;
The hall of the House of Representa-&#xD;
tives presented a grand appearance with&#xD;
its immense area, superb brecela co-&#xD;
lumns,* an~ lofty dome. It is badly con-&#xD;
structed for speaking, the enunciation of&#xD;
the most powerful voice being lost among&#xD;
its angles and galleries. In the summer,&#xD;
the atmosphere is insufferably warm.&#xD;
The sun at midday, falls with all its in-&#xD;
tensity upon that wing of the Capitol, and&#xD;
the mass of rooms and walls beyond,&#xD;
prevents a circulation of air.&#xD;
Th~ National Capitol, and the grounds&#xD;
which surround it, never fail to arrest the&#xD;
attention of the traveller. The 'building&#xD;
occupies the most commanding height in&#xD;
the city. Approaching it from the Presi-&#xD;
dent's house, along Pennsylvania Avenue,&#xD;
* There is nothing in washington more attractive&#xD;
than these breccia columns. There are not less than&#xD;
thirty of them in the hall of the House of Representa-&#xD;
tives. They are placed along the outside of the circle,&#xD;
and against their massive proportiousrests the ladies'&#xD;
and gentlemen's gallery. The component parts of the&#xD;
stone must have been at one time nothing but peb.&#xD;
bles of all sizes shapes, and colours, but subsequently&#xD;
blended together by a concretion, which has given&#xD;
them the consistency of solid marble, with the power&#xD;
of sustaining a polish even more smooth and mirror-&#xD;
like.&#xD;
&#xD;
CLIF&#xD;
&#xD;
it presents a grand appearance, which is&#xD;
greatly increased upon entering the&#xD;
groun4s. There is nothing attractive in&#xD;
the basement, which is very properly&#xD;
screened from the observation of the dis-&#xD;
tant or casual examiner, by a terrace.&#xD;
The rest of the building is built in the Cor-&#xD;
rinthian style; the columns which adorn&#xD;
the eastern and western porticoes, are&#xD;
thirty-six feet high. The library opens&#xD;
upon the western portico; this spot over-&#xD;
looks Pennsylvania Avenue, and indeed,&#xD;
almost the entire city of Washington. In&#xD;
the centre building, is the far-famed Ro-&#xD;
tunda. Its lofty height, its overhanging&#xD;
arch, its renowned paintings, combine to&#xD;
make it one of the most attractive locali-&#xD;
ties in the building. The length of the&#xD;
Capitol is three hundred and fifty-two feet,&#xD;
depth of the wings, one hundred and&#xD;
twenty-one feet. The grounds cover an&#xD;
area of thirty acres. The western, portion&#xD;
is by far the most attractive, being a suc-&#xD;
cession of terraces at first, and then a&#xD;
gradual descent ,to Pennsylvania Avenue.&#xD;
The eastern part is highly ornamented but&#xD;
is almost a dead level.&#xD;
The Capitol is not built, as many sup-&#xD;
pose, of white marble. That, as well as&#xD;
the White House, and Treasury Building,&#xD;
is built of a porous ~Nstone, and they&#xD;
are all preserved from the action of the&#xD;
elements by liberal coats of paint. The&#xD;
National Post-office is the most classic and&#xD;
elegant building in the city. The blocks&#xD;
are manufactured from beautiful white&#xD;
marble, which defies the action of the ele-&#xD;
ments. The locality of Washington is un-&#xD;
fortunate, and its selection as the metro-&#xD;
polis, proves the moderate expectations of&#xD;
its founders. The principal part of the cit~&#xD;
is built upon a marsh, and the slope wh&#xD;
leads to it. There is no commerce&#xD;
which its importance is to be increase&#xD;
and stuck down upon the banks of the&#xD;
Potomac in a barren waste, it will always&#xD;
have a sickly existence, dependent alone&#xD;
upon the public treasury. If a sterile soil&#xD;
and isolated situation were selected for the&#xD;
purpose of preventing the growth of the&#xD;
city, in order to avoid the danger of mobs,&#xD;
a much better spot could have been chosen.&#xD;
The impolicy of the selection was pain-&#xD;
fully illustrated during the administration&#xD;
of the fourth President, when the humili-&#xD;
ating spectacle was witnessed of a Capitol&#xD;
in ruins, and a Government dispersed.&#xD;
The event disclosed the folly which placed&#xD;
the archives of the country within reach&#xD;
of the Vandal's torch. The Capitol should&#xD;
have been located further from the sea-&#xD;
coast; the wilderness west of the Allegha-&#xD;
&#xD;
TON.                             189&#xD;
nies, if necessary. It is not too late to&#xD;
remove it now. If timely notice is given,&#xD;
it can be defended, where it stands, against&#xD;
any force that may be landed on our&#xD;
shores. But in case of a sudden irruption,&#xD;
with the aid of steamers, it might again&#xD;
fall into the hands of the modern Goths.&#xD;
That disaster should not a second time mor-&#xD;
tify the pride of a people who can protect&#xD;
the Capitol, if erected where it ought to&#xD;
bein the valley of the Mississippi, against&#xD;
the assaults of a million of armed men.&#xD;
There are unanswerable arguments in&#xD;
favour of its removal. The centre of our&#xD;
power, will soon be a thousand miles West&#xD;
of Washington, and it is idle to suppose&#xD;
that members will consent to traverse the&#xD;
confederacy, in order to reach the Capitol,&#xD;
when it can be changed by the stroke of&#xD;
a pen. The day is past, when half-reve-&#xD;
rential, half-superstitious objections could&#xD;
be successfully urged, because the Father&#xD;
of his country, selected Washington as the&#xD;
seat of the General Government. Already,&#xD;
the work of his hands is crumbling beneath&#xD;
the touch of policy.&#xD;
That part of the District of Columbia&#xD;
~which was granted by his native State, has&#xD;
been retroceded by an overwhelming&#xD;
majority; notwithstanding the constitu-&#xD;
tional objections of John Quincy Adams.&#xD;
In this progressive age, reverence and su-&#xD;
perstition afford slight barriers to the iron&#xD;
decrees of an invincible necessity, and&#xD;
those who seek to arrest its progress with&#xD;
a name, however potent, will be whelmed&#xD;
by its irresistible career. The cost of all&#xD;
the public buildings in Washington, is less&#xD;
than seven~millions that cannot therefore&#xD;
be urged as an objection to a removal.&#xD;
Great preparations were being made by&#xD;
the Secretary of State, for his party, at&#xD;
Carusi's Saloon. No private residence was&#xD;
sufficiently spacious to entertain the guests.&#xD;
Mr. Buchanan was rich, and a bachelor.&#xD;
Although age began to frost his locks, still&#xD;
his heart was genial, and hi~ general ad-&#xD;
miration for the sex, continued unabated.&#xD;
No one was a more welcome visitor at&#xD;
the Presidential receptions, than that portly&#xD;
gentleman, What if his head is bent up-&#xD;
on one side, and his left eye does squint,&#xD;
as if he was glancing the other a long the&#xD;
barrel of a rifle, it does not impair his affa-&#xD;
bility.&#xD;
The services of the city confectioners,&#xD;
were called into requisition, the oyster cel-&#xD;
lars and lobster saloons were exhausted,&#xD;
canvass-back duck, partridges, and quails,&#xD;
were collected. Every preparation was&#xD;
made to render the affair one of extra-&#xD;
ordinary brilliance. Distinguished stran-&#xD;

gers in the city were anxious to obtain&#xD;
invitations, and the towns was on the qui&#xD;
vive.&#xD;
At length the evening arrived. A long&#xD;
line of Larriages, thronged Pennsylvania&#xD;
Avenue, the head of which was turning&#xD;
into a cross street, in the direction of the&#xD;
Mall. When Clifton entered the room, the&#xD;
contrast between the gloom without, and&#xD;
the glare within, was painful to the eye.&#xD;
The Halls were almost lined with sperm&#xD;
candles, which cast a radiant light through-&#xD;
out the Hall. The courteous Secretary re-&#xD;
ceived the guests within the door. The&#xD;
room was already filled. The ladies vied&#xD;
with each other in the magnificence of&#xD;
their dresses. It was almost like a fancy&#xD;
ball, so varied were the robes. There&#xD;
was the rich, though subdued attire of&#xD;
the North, the gay habiliments of the&#xD;
W~st, and the dazzling costume of the&#xD;
South. Almost every State in the Union&#xD;
contributed a choice flower to the array of&#xD;
beauty which made up the lovely bouquet.&#xD;
The beautiful figure and dignified man-&#xD;
ners of the Bostonian, the exquisite form&#xD;
and graceful ease of the New Yorker, the&#xD;
faultless elegance of the Philadelphian,&#xD;
the buoyant spirits and sparkling wit of&#xD;
the Baltimorean, the dark eyes and warm-&#xD;
hearted candor of the Tennesseean, the&#xD;
rosy cheeks and impulsive vivacity of the&#xD;
Louisianian, the unstudied frankness of&#xD;
the Georgian, and the self-possessed and&#xD;
lady-like bearing of the Virginian. It is&#xD;
this mingling and contrast of character&#xD;
which gives the balls of the Metropolis&#xD;
their peculiar attraction.&#xD;
Conventionalities exercise a powerful&#xD;
influence upon manners, a i~~d this fact is&#xD;
nowheremoreperceptible~aninthesa-~&#xD;
loons of Washington. That barrier whic~&#xD;
restrains the impulses of the Northern gid~&#xD;
is past with a dashing bound, by the&#xD;
spirited Southerner. The belles- of New&#xD;
England possess less of that charming&#xD;
piquancy-call it coquetry if you will&#xD;
which renders those of the Middle States,&#xD;
so agreeable. But, even the latter cannot&#xD;
claim that unstudied, impulsive vivacity,&#xD;
which makes the warm-hearted Southerner&#xD;
so popular in the ball-room, and social&#xD;
circle.&#xD;
The assemblage was not exclusively&#xD;
American. The bearded face of the&#xD;
Russian minister, was conspicuous in the&#xD;
throng; his breast covered with orders,&#xD;
while upon his arm, leaned an ornament&#xD;
far more beautiful than them all-his&#xD;
lovely American wife. The English am-&#xD;
bassador, with his quiet gentlemanly ad-&#xD;
dress-you would know him for a bachelor&#xD;
&#xD;
'TO0N.&#xD;
&#xD;
bowed his way through the crowd. No one&#xD;
cOul(l tell from the courteous words which&#xD;
were exchanged between the Secretary of&#xD;
State and himself, that they had recently&#xD;
met in the lists, from which the English&#xD;
functionary had escaped with the loss of&#xD;
his shield.&#xD;
The servant of Louis Philippe had not&#xD;
the appearance of one who would aban-&#xD;
don a lucrative post, because his master&#xD;
was compelled to vacate a throne. Sub-&#xD;
jects who are not within the blaze of&#xD;
royalty, are often the most devoted.&#xD;
There was the massive brow and broad&#xD;
shoulders of the Massachusetts Senator;&#xD;
conviviality unbent the austerity of his&#xD;
manner, and he *was engaged in con-&#xD;
versation, not boisterous, but merry, with&#xD;
the eloquent Senator from Kentucky.&#xD;
They had yielded themselves to the hour.&#xD;
In another p art of the saloon was the&#xD;
iron-gray head and restless eyes of the&#xD;
distinguished South Carolinian. Even in&#xD;
that festive scene he could not distract his&#xD;
mind from the one al~sorbing idea of his&#xD;
life,-the wrongs of Ihe South. A knot&#xD;
had collected to listen to his short sen-&#xD;
tences, and compact language. Further&#xD;
onWas the~,portly for$n of "illd Bullion."&#xD;
He could scarcely overcome the habit of&#xD;
talking to himself, or prevent his arms&#xD;
from indulging in quick, passionate ges-&#xD;
tures.&#xD;
But here comes a tall, commanding&#xD;
f6rm; aged, but not in the slightest degree&#xD;
bent. He becomes the cynosure upon&#xD;
whom all eyes are fixed. His attention is&#xD;
bestowed, undividedly, upon the throng&#xD;
who surround him. It is the eloquent and&#xD;
gallant "Harry of the West."&#xD;
Near him, and conversing in a rapid&#xD;
and earnest manner, is a gentleman with&#xD;
4~ing straight hair, thin pale face, and slen-&#xD;
A er finger, pointed significantly towards&#xD;
the Kentucky Statesman. This is Henry&#xD;
A. Wise.&#xD;
In the upper part of the room is a ma-&#xD;
jestic form, clad in the undress uniform of&#xD;
a general officer. He mingles very little&#xD;
in the conversation, yet his eagle glance is&#xD;
thrown over the crowd, and rests for a long&#xD;
time upon Mr. Clay. It is the commander-&#xD;
in-chief of the regular army-then the&#xD;
hero of Lundy's Lane-subsequently of&#xD;
the Mexican Garitas-later still-the occu-&#xD;
pant of the white house'?&#xD;
Not a dozen feet from the warrior, is a&#xD;
figure almost as athletic, and altogether&#xD;
more graceful, whose urbanity of manner&#xD;
and conversational powers, have collected&#xD;
a circle around him. He is the hero of&#xD;
San Jacinto, and the first President of the&#xD;
&#xD;
C L I F T 0 N.&#xD;
&#xD;
"lone star republic." And this portly gen-&#xD;
tleman, whose dimensions are almost&#xD;
equal to Jack Falstaff and whose counte-&#xD;
nance would indicate the consumption of&#xD;
quite as much ale as had the effect of&#xD;
blowing the doughty knight CC up like a&#xD;
bladder." is the successful foe of the triple&#xD;
alliance, and the embodiment of progres-&#xD;
sive democracy.&#xD;
Following in his footsteps is a dwarfish&#xD;
figure, with almost a hang-dog look, whose&#xD;
manners are half-modest, half-sycophantic.&#xD;
He was the successful champion of free&#xD;
trade. And who is this, with heavy tread&#xD;
and countenance: with bent neck and&#xD;
rough exterior? It is the long-headed,&#xD;
plodding, sagacious, logical, Secretary of&#xD;
War.&#xD;
And this bald-headed, mild blue-eyed,&#xD;
tall, and venerable-looking man, whose&#xD;
soft and winning address calls so many&#xD;
smiles to the lips of his friends'? Why that&#xD;
is " Old Cave," Postmaster-General.&#xD;
There is now quite a commotion near&#xD;
the door. Another distinguished arrival'?&#xD;
The crowd parts, an avenue is formed&#xD;
along the centre of the room. A slight&#xD;
person, of scarcely the medium height,&#xD;
bows his way through the crowd. He has&#xD;
a bright, full, intelligent gray eye; his&#xD;
forehead is projecting; his mouth and chin&#xD;
indicate great firmness and resolution ; his&#xD;
hair is partially silvered, although he has&#xD;
scarcely reached the prime of life- This&#xD;
is the chief magistrate of the American&#xD;
confederacy.&#xD;

CONTINUATION OF ALICE HOWARD~ S JOURNAL.&#xD;
"NOVEMBER, 1845.-A new era in my&#xD;
life isaj~proaching. I am about to leave&#xD;
ich I have hitherto trod in&#xD;
safety, for the unknown realms of matri-&#xD;
mony. The most important event which&#xD;
occurs during our existence, is often&#xD;
thoughtlessly welcomed as a harbinger of'&#xD;
&#xD;
191&#xD;
&#xD;
bliss. It is a dread change. It requires&#xD;
the full mastery of love to overcome a&#xD;
modesty which shrinks within itself. It&#xD;
calls into requisition the strongest ties of&#xD;
affection when we surrender our identity&#xD;
and self-control. We exchange a cer-&#xD;
tainty for an uncertainty. But every suc-&#xD;
ceeding moment of time is an uncertainty!&#xD;
The past is our experier~ce-the present is&#xD;
our reality-but the future'? it is unknown.&#xD;
"Is love changeable'? Can it be an&#xD;
evanescent passion, which possession&#xD;
destroys'? Fearful thought! No! no! it&#xD;
must be that essence of our being which&#xD;
divines call immortality. Love is the&#xD;
passport to the confines of heaven; it is&#xD;
the watchword of the Christian warrior.&#xD;
May not a particle of its spirituality be&#xD;
infused into that earthly sentiment which&#xD;
mortals feel for each other. If the man of&#xD;
God forsakes the world, and sacrifices the&#xD;
temptations of earth upon the altar of duty,&#xD;
does not the maiden abandon everything&#xD;
for her accepted lover'?&#xD;
"But I have seen ardent lovers become&#xD;
indifferent, when the anxiety and uncer-&#xD;
tainty of courtship yield to the assurance&#xD;
of possession. Did they never love, or&#xD;
loving once, have they been alienated'?&#xD;
If such should be my fate'? It would be&#xD;
too horrible. Yet my own feelings may&#xD;
change, and that which now appears so&#xD;
frightful, by familiarity, may be viewed&#xD;
with indifference. Ah! 'no, that were im-&#xD;
possible. 21 have loved him too long; my&#xD;
affections have resisted too many assaults.&#xD;
He knows I love him; his feelings are not,&#xD;
therefore, wrought upon by doubt. No, I&#xD;
will believe him. He is noble, generous,&#xD;
magnanimous, and I will trustingly yield&#xD;
my happiness to his control.&#xD;
"December, 1845.-My wedding-day&#xD;
approaching, and the moments seem to&#xD;
fly while I am preparing for that event.&#xD;
Perhaps Edward would not thank me for&#xD;
the admission. My occupation are so&#xD;
intimately connected with hims~~ that,&#xD;
although absent, he seems constantly be-&#xD;
fore me. The immense fortune left me&#xD;
hy my father, enables me to gratify every&#xD;
wish, and rriy wardrobe, mamma says, is&#xD;
already sufficiently large. Still each day&#xD;
I am making additions. The wedding-&#xD;
dress is at last selected. It was my taste,&#xD;
although mamma and Miss Glendower&#xD;
advised another costume.&#xD;
"I hope I shall look well in it.&#xD;
"I do not mean, after marriage, to fol-&#xD;

to think that any dress will do for their&#xD;

their attire has always been faultless.&#xD;
After the knot is tied, what necessity is&#xD;
there for keeping up appearances? Are&#xD;
not their fortunes made? Common, vul-&#xD;
garfatal error. Is there not a possibility&#xD;
that love may yield to disgust? To dress&#xD;
for my husband shall be my first thought,&#xD;
and if I delight him, what care I for&#xD;
others? That he is pleased to see a lady&#xD;
dress with taste, I am perfectly satisfied.&#xD;
I will not ask him if he likes this or that&#xD;
style; that shall be my task. But the effect&#xD;
of neit her will escape me. A man does&#xD;
not often assume the tiresome duty of&#xD;
superintending a lady's wardrobe. He is&#xD;
sometimes forced to do it, when his wife&#xD;
is utterly destitute of taste. Some men,&#xD;
also, are just fussy enough to delight in&#xD;
such occupations. But the task must be&#xD;
irksome to the sterner sex. They are&#xD;
satisfied, if their wives dress with taste,&#xD;
without the annoyance of thinking about&#xD;
it themselves.&#xD;
CC My wedding robe has been sent home&#xD;
by the dress-maker. They say it fits me&#xD;
exactly. I think it is rather too low in the&#xD;
neck, but Miss Glendewer says, not for&#xD;
one who has such an 'exquisite bust, and&#xD;
whose neck and shoulders are the per-&#xD;
fection of Nature's workmanship.'&#xD;
"December 27, 1845.-My arrange-&#xD;
ments are completed, and to-morrow I&#xD;
stand at the altar. My heart beats as&#xD;
wildly, but not so pain fully, as whenithe&#xD;
angry waves of the mountain lake were&#xD;
dashing over me. It is an intoxicating&#xD;
and joyous emotion, which causes this&#xD;
fluttering at my heart. Edward has just&#xD;
left me; how kind and affectionate were&#xD;
his words; what ardent devotion beamed&#xD;
from his dark, lustrous eyes.&#xD;
"What my fate may hereafter become,&#xD;
I know not; but I have an unyielding con-&#xD;
fidence in the power of love. I will so&#xD;
tenderly caress the fickle god that he shall&#xD;
never abandon me, and when I enter upon&#xD;
a new existence, it will be with the hope&#xD;
of obtaining happiness, without being&#xD;
pained by the doubts which have hitherto&#xD;
been its bane. I do not give my hand&#xD;
while my heart is secretly clinging to&#xD;
&#xD;
TO0N.&#xD;
&#xD;
another. My affections have not been&#xD;
lacerated by disappointment. I have not&#xD;
sought to win the love of one who lightly&#xD;
treated my advances, only to yield my&#xD;
bruised heart to the most available candi-&#xD;
date for my hand. No !-I have given the&#xD;
concentrated power of my virgin affec-&#xD;
tions, hitherto untouched and uncontami-&#xD;
nated, into the keeping of my betrothed.&#xD;
May God direct him to preserve the gift&#xD;
within the inmost recesses of his heart !"&#xD;
Thus closed the journal of Alice How-&#xD;
ard. Whether she transferred to its pages,&#xD;
in after life, the emotions of a teeming&#xD;
brain, we are profoundly ignorant.&#xD;
The morning of the wedding-day dawned&#xD;
upon an unclouded sky. The ceremony&#xD;
was performed at Mrs. Howard's. Her&#xD;
bridesmaids urged her to be married in&#xD;
church; but she shrank from the gaze of&#xD;
the vulgar, who claim it as a privilege to&#xD;
throng the aisles, whenever a couple are&#xD;
thus publicly united in the bonds of matri-&#xD;
mony.&#xD;
Hand in hand, they started upon the&#xD;
journey of life, with the consciousness of&#xD;
possessing those essential elements of mor-&#xD;
tal happiness,-mutual confidence and un-&#xD;
changeable love. May their pathway be&#xD;
strewn with thornless flowers, ar~d their&#xD;
earthly bliss be unmarred by a sorrow or a&#xD;
tear!&#xD;
Dear reade~, in commencing this book,&#xD;
you received rio pledges, made only to be&#xD;
broken. There was no attempt to allure&#xD;
you onward, by the promise of either&#xD;
mental improvement or momentary plea-&#xD;
sure. If to this page you have followed&#xD;
the career of Edward Clifton and Alice&#xD;
Howard, we hope an occasional smile has&#xD;
played upon the lips of beauty, and&#xD;
smoothed the wrinkles upon the brow of&#xD;
manhood; that the heartstrings of all have&#xD;
thrilled with pleasure or trembled with&#xD;
emotion, and that the restless and immortal&#xD;
mind may have a somewhat clearer per-&#xD;
ception of that temporary existence which&#xD;
is but the forerunner of eternity. If so,&#xD;
dear and gentle reader, the author has not&#xD;
labored in vain.&#xD;
