HIRL, THE HUNCHBACK.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
CHAPTER.I.&#xD;
THE FUGITIVE.-           -&#xD;
The clattering of horses' feet, the ringing&#xD;
notes of a trumpet, and the shouts of dra-&#xD;
goons, suddenly disturbed the solitudes of tie,&#xD;
Santee. A man with bare head and stream-&#xD;
ing hair was seen to leap a wall and run&#xD;
rapidly across a glade. Toiling up a rugged&#xD;
ascent, he paused on the summit and looked&#xD;
back upon his pursuers ; for the horsemen&#xD;
were evidently such.  A glance sufficed, to&#xD;
show that they were rapidly gaining ground.&#xD;
A feeling of utter hopelessness for a moment&#xD;
chained him to the spot. Large drops of&#xD;
perspiration rained from his forehead; the&#xD;
blood whirled wildly in his veins ; his chest&#xD;
rose and fell violently ; and he panted like a&#xD;
dog overheated in the chase.&#xD;
The thunder of the dragoons rolled nearer&#xD;
and nearer ; the sound struck ominously upon&#xD;
his ears.&#xD;
"Colonel Somerton and his dragoons !" he&#xD;
muttered, drawing the palm of his hand across&#xD;
his hot brow. "Brave as a lion and impetu-&#xD;
ous as a whirlwind ! he, mu-t be fest of foot&#xD;
who baffles him. I have dared his vigilance&#xD;
once too often. How madly he rides-leap-&#xD;
ing walls, fences, ditches, rocks, and fallen&#xD;
trees! He is down-no, he is up ! It was but&#xD;
a depression of the ground that hid him from&#xD;
view. They see me ! I mu-t on !"&#xD;
He ceased, pressed his hand to his beating&#xD;
heart, and added, bitterly :&#xD;
"I must on; but where? The hounded fox&#xD;
may find a cover, and the hunted stag may&#xD;
turn upon the pack ; but I can do neither."&#xD;
The fugitive darted down the hill, an4pres-&#xD;
ently reached the bank of the Santee, the&#xD;
waters of which at that spot were deep and&#xD;
rapid. He hesitated ; it required a strong&#xD;
and bold swimmer to dare such a 'current.&#xD;
&#xD;
The voice of Colonel Somerton came echoing&#xD;
down the hill :&#xD;
"Forward, men ! forwardI The villain is&#xD;
ours!"&#xD;
That shout quickened him to another effort.&#xD;
lHe bounded froi, the bank, was submerged an&#xD;
instant; but. rising, struck outfor the opposite&#xD;
shore. The stream bore him downward with&#xD;
irresistible force. le battled with the waters,&#xD;
parting them with his strong, nervous arms.&#xD;
Somerton'spurred his horse, and attempted&#xD;
to follow ; but the animal soon lost his footing,&#xD;
and was swept from his eourse. His dragoons,&#xD;
less heated by the chase, or more prudent, re-&#xD;
mained on the bank, watching anxiously the&#xD;
progress of their leader, and the manly exer-&#xD;
tions of the swimmer, who, notwithstanding&#xD;
the difficulties with which he was obliged to&#xD;
contend, finally effected a landing, far below&#xD;
the point from which he bad started. For a&#xD;
short space he lay exhausted upon the earth ;&#xD;
then, staggering to his feet, shook the water&#xD;
from his saturated garments. By this time,&#xD;
Somerton was in the middle of the stream;&#xD;
there was no time to be lost. He ran up the&#xD;
bapk. Before him was an open field, with a&#xD;
wood beyond. Hope animated his breast, im-&#xD;
parting strength to his over-tasked limbs. If&#xD;
he could cross the field and enter the wood,&#xD;
he could defy pursuit. Stimulated by this&#xD;
thought, he leaped a high fence. and was mak-&#xD;
ing good progress, when, to his dismay, he&#xD;
again henrd Somerton thundering after him.&#xD;
.The wood was too distant to be attained. At&#xD;
the right of the field there was a tract of&#xD;
broken, ledgy ground, which be believed would&#xD;
embarrass the movements of his pursuers,&#xD;
and toward which he now turned, like the&#xD;
wounded stag, which at every step loses a&#xD;
portion of its strength with its flowing blood.&#xD;
By efforts that seemed superhuman, he reach-&#xD;

"What less earthly than thou can I think&#xD;
of?" *aid the spy, with enthusidsm. "Angelic&#xD;
goodness prompted this visit. Who but thee&#xD;
would have sought a wretch destined to die on&#xD;
the morrow? Thou hast sweetened my cup o&#xD;
bitterness, till the direful potion of death has&#xD;
lost half its horror."&#xD;
"How.dreadful is your position!" replied&#xD;
Miss Redmond, with mournful vehemence.&#xD;
Alas, Guy, for your memory when all is o- er !&#xD;
Had you forfeited life in the cause of freedom,&#xD;
this parting would have been less painful ;&#xD;
but .to ge out of the world covered. with the&#xD;
ignominy of a British spy, gives me'inexpres-&#xD;
sible pain. 0 Guy, is there no escape?&#xD;
Have you not some powerful friend in the&#xD;
Continental Army-or is there not some means&#xD;
by which you can scale these wooden walls-&#xD;
elude the sentinels-and leave the gallows be-&#xD;
hind? If I were a man,-I would find some&#xD;
way-hit upon some happy invention-or, de-&#xD;
-vise some subtle plan of cheating even Fate&#xD;
.itself; if it led to such disgrace.  I would&#xD;
"move heaven and earth with my endeavors !"&#xD;
She paused, and pressed her burning fore-&#xD;
-head with her hand.&#xD;
" Judith, beloved Judith, you torture me&#xD;
,And yet," he added, " it is something to know&#xD;
'that I have the sympathy of the best being&#xD;
on earth I I thank thee a thousand times for&#xD;
-thy. tender pity."&#xD;
" Strange, incomprehensibly strange, that a&#xD;
'soul like thine should spurn the claims of&#xD;
country 'and-patriotism !" said Judith, looking&#xD;
earnestly at the sorrowful face of her lover. .&#xD;
"Mercy, Judith, mercy! Thy words cut&#xD;
.like the sabres of Marion's men-ay, deeper ;&#xD;
.for they reach to thesoul itself." .&#xD;
" A British spy1" gasped Judith. "Guy&#xD;
-Deering, can this be you?"&#xD;
There' was a world of agony in these utter-&#xD;
ances. Neither for a time could speak.&#xD;
" Can I ,endure this ?" muttered the spy,&#xD;
presently. ' Shall. I .go hence and make no&#xD;
-sign ? Imust-I must !"&#xD;
"Guy Deering,- you are struggling with&#xD;
some great. secret. Speak it, in Heaven's&#xD;

She took his ha.nd,'And turned her beautiful&#xD;
face upon him in ineffable entreaty.&#xD;
"'Tis past, 'tis past I" he murmured, huski-&#xD;
ly, and with a faint and fading smile. "I am&#xD;
-I am strong again.' Now, dearest,' talk not&#xD;
.of me,-but of -thy darling sblf. If I shake oft&#xD;
this outward form of humanity, I will like&#xD;

'CHAPTER III.&#xD;
HIRL, THE HUNoClnAot.&#xD;
The soft and mellow haze of twilight was&#xD;
descending upon the:camp, when the clear&#xD;
challenge of an American sentinel rang out&#xD;
upon 'the air:&#xD;
- ".Who goes there ?"&#xD;
" A friend."&#xD;
"Stop, friend, and give the counersign."&#xD;
The person thus challenged was seated in a&#xD;
cart, which was drawn by a sorry-looking horse&#xD;
-the thinness of which seemed to attest to a&#xD;
long penance of fasting. The driver of this&#xD;
animal was far-from prepossessing in appears&#xD;
ance. He was of large, frame, but his figure&#xD;
was rendered disagreeable by a painful stoop&#xD;
and a monstrous protuberance between hit&#xD;
shoulders. We cannot describe him better&#xD;
than by simply affirming that he was a hunch-&#xD;
back. His face, which otherwise would not&#xD;
have been ugly, was made repulsive by a&#xD;
wound upon the right cheek, imperfectly con-&#xD;
cealed by a patch. He had apparently pass-&#xD;
ed the prime of. life, for long gray hairs flu-&#xD;
tered over his forehead. He wore a sut os&#xD;
homespun, brown, better adapted 'for hard&#xD;
service than show. His patriarchal head was&#xD;
protected by a round cloth cap, which bore&#xD;
unmistakable impress of long use.&#xD;
A large powder-horn and ball-pouch hung&#xD;
under his left arm; while 'beside him in the&#xD;
cart, braced against the rude seat, was one of&#xD;
those redoubtable weapons denominated the&#xD;
king's-arm.'&#xD;
Instead of stopping his horse when chal-&#xD;
lenged, he jogged on, jerking the reins, and&#xD;
muttering&#xD;
" Go 'long, Crazy ! go 'long! A'n't afeard&#xD;
o' nothin' you see hereabouts, be ye ?"&#xD;
"Halt I". shouted the sentinel, raising his&#xD;
musket.&#xD;
" Git out the w y,' you ragged critter.&#xD;
Don't you know b tter than to be standin'&#xD;
right :in the way of a hoss and cart ?" cried&#xD;
the hunchback, petulantly.&#xD;
" Stop, or I fire !" said the sentinel, warn-&#xD;
ingly.&#xD;
'" Whoa, Crazy, whoa!" said the old man,&#xD;
stopping his bony beast with much tugging&#xD;
and sawing upon the bit. " Don't pint that&#xD;
-gun. at me, you reckless divil! Why in the&#xD;
name o' conscience don't you fight the inemy&#xD;
instead o' your friends? Nobody'll coma&#xD;
anighst ye bimeby, if you go on in this ry.&#xD;
dicerlous way. What in time you want ?"&#xD;
"' The'countersign, you old' fool-the coun.&#xD;

The hunchback cocked his head upon one&#xD;
side with that earnest vacuity of expression&#xD;
indicative of the unhappy infirmity which he&#xD;
had avowed.&#xD;
" You heerd well enough jest now !" snarl-&#xD;
ed the soldier. -&#xD;

Tie hunchback looked at the sentinel with&#xD;
an air of such perfect simpli ity, that he could&#xD;
not refrain from laughing.&#xD;
I reckon you know a precious sight about&#xD;
military affairs, oil mn. Do you s'pose the&#xD;
great Washington goes canterin' about the&#xD;
country like an itinerantparson or a common&#xD;
whipster."&#xD;
They say he's a mighty good fighter, and&#xD;
makes- the redcoats run like a flock o' sheep."&#xD;
,Enough of this, old gentleman ! Give me&#xD;
the countersign, or move off."&#xD;
" My name's IIirl-old Hirl, ill-mannered&#xD;
folks call me."&#xD;
"Confound him!" muttered the soldier.&#xD;
"What do I do ? Used to be a blacksmith ;&#xD;
am a swordmnaker, now. Made quite a lot o'&#xD;
weapons for Marion's men. Cut up old mill-&#xD;
saws and si :h. Let me in, will ye? Can't&#xD;
stan' here fooling' much longer."&#xD;
"I've a mind to fire on the old chatter-&#xD;
box !" said the sentinel, beginning to be an-&#xD;
gry again.&#xD;
"'Yes, I'm right handy with tools ; can put&#xD;
-          an edge on your sabres that'll cut a hair.&#xD;
Sog3r-feller, that bagonet o' your'n is blunt&#xD;
as your thumb. How can you stick sich a&#xD;
thing as that into a Britisher? Might as well&#xD;
carry a b 'an-pole."&#xD;
Losing all patience, the sentinel strode up&#xD;
to the hunchback, anI1 seizing him by the col-&#xD;
lar, howled in his ear :&#xD;
"The password! the password !"&#xD;
" Why the divil didn't you say so in the&#xD;
fast place ?" screamed the old man, fretfully.&#xD;
"Come down to bring a few sabres to Wash-&#xD;

" I asked you for the countersign ten min-&#xD;
utes ago.'"&#xD;
"I hain't got it ;" and if I had, I wouldn't&#xD;
deliver it to nobody but the gineral. I ain't&#xD;
a man as seeks arter signs of no kind." '&#xD;
At that juncture, Captain Rainford, who&#xD;
had heard a part of this dialogue, stepped for-&#xD;
ward and demanded of the proprietor of the&#xD;
horse and cart what he wanted.&#xD;
" I want to see the officer in command," an-&#xD;
&#xD;
swered the hunchback, peevishly. " Been&#xD;
bothered here nigh on to half an hour, and&#xD;
I'm sorry to say, mister, that the regerlations&#xD;
here is a disgrace to the Continent il Congress&#xD;

into the cart, and hurried right down with a&#xD;
few o' my best razors, that'll shave a Britisher&#xD;
'thout lather or hot water. Come and look at&#xD;
'em, sir. Or, perhaps," added the hunchback,&#xD;
reflectively, "you'd better take me right to&#xD;
the gineral."&#xD;
Then to the sentinel:&#xD;
" Watch that cart, there, for you don't seem&#xD;
to have nothin' else to do ; though if I's boss&#xD;
here, I'd keep ye a shoulderin', and orderin',&#xD;
and presenting' till you could scurcely st-m' on&#xD;
your legs. I shall speak to Washington about&#xD;
the gineral looseness hereabouts, in p'int o'&#xD;
disciplyne."&#xD;
" You've brought us some blades of home&#xD;
manufacture, have you, my good man ?" said&#xD;
Rainford, smiling.&#xD;
"He's brought the High Hills of the Santee&#xD;
on his back, I should think !" muttered the&#xD;
sentinel.&#xD;
"Yes, major, I'ye brought ye some good&#xD;
'uns that I'll warrant to do the business, if&#xD;
properly used."  Then to the soldier: " You&#xD;
feller with the musket, you can have the pass-&#xD;
'word now, if you want it; though little good&#xD;
it'll do ye, for I's bound to see your com&#xD;
mander, anyhow. Marion ! there, you hay&#xD;
it ! I hope this'll teach ye to mind your own&#xD;
consarns, and treat the friends o' Cgngress&#xD;
with respect. Come 'up, Crazy, come up !&#xD;
Guess, on the whole, we'll take the cart right&#xD;
along, for somebody might steal' the razors,&#xD;
you know; and I should be pesky loth to have&#xD;
'em swingin' on the wrong side, hashin' up&#xD;
our folks 'stead o' the Britishers."&#xD;
" You are very welcome, my man. Bring&#xD;
your horse and cart inside the lines. Whiat's.&#xD;
your name ?" said the captain, eyeing his&#xD;
strange visitor with considerable curiosity.&#xD;
" My name is Hirl; though ill-mannered&#xD;
people call me Old Hirl, Crazy Hirl, Deef&#xD;
Hirl, and so on. You can take your choice,&#xD;
major. ' In times of peace I was a smith ; but&#xD;
now I'm a swordmaker, and can sharpen up&#xD;
your tools to a turn, if you like. Any news&#xD;
.stirrin' ?"&#xD;
" Nothing of importance, excepting the cap-&#xD;
ture of a tory spy," replied Rainford, care-&#xD;
lessly.&#xD;
" Come'long, Crazy ! The old gal's gittin'&#xD;
tired. A spy, eh ?  Well that's good news !&#xD;
You'll string him up right up, I s'pose ?" said&#xD;
the hunchback, with a business air.&#xD;
''He will be executed to-morrow morning."&#xD;
"This is a nice creetur o' mine, major. You&#xD;

"follow fast on the heels of your examina-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
A bitter smile swept over the prisoner's&#xD;
pale lips.&#xD;
The colonel colored, and exhibited confu-&#xD;
sion.-o&#xD;
" Your generosity," resumed the spy,&#xD;
"might have permitted me a few hours for&#xD;
repose, uninterrupted by those dire notes of&#xD;
'preparation, without stain upon your patriot-&#xD;
ism."&#xD;
"Repose, indeed ! Innocence itself could&#xD;
not sleep in a situation so awful !"&#xD;
Somerton spoke with the solemnity he&#xD;
really felt ; while the prisoner's handsome&#xD;
face lighted with some inexplicable emotion.&#xD;
The wonder and bewilderment of the colonel&#xD;
increased, communicating corresponding feel-&#xD;
ings to the practical Rainford.&#xD;
" We gain nothing," said the latter ; " and&#xD;
the interview is becoming uncomfortable."&#xD;
"Good night, gentlemen! We shall meet&#xD;
again in the morning," said the prisoner, with&#xD;
his peculiar look and smile.&#xD;
" Whoever 'you are, I am sorry for you,"&#xD;
answered Somerton, slowly following Rain-&#xD;
ford from the cabin.&#xD;
Sergeant Giles was standing near the door.&#xD;
"Sergeant," the colonel began, " you saw&#xD;
the hunchback-"&#xD;
He suddenly checked himself, adding, in a&#xD;
lower voice :&#xD;
" Pshaw ! what nonsense ! There can be&#xD;
no mistake. 'Tis the last trick of a gamester&#xD;
who plays for life. Drowning nen catch at&#xD;
straws."&#xD;
As the officer walked away, he was followed&#xD;
by the dissonance of the saw, and the 'dull&#xD;
sound of the -hammer. He turned and be-&#xD;
held, with an involuntary shiver, men raising&#xD;
two posts with a transverse beam. He hur-&#xD;
ried to his quarters ; but could stillsee, in&#xD;
imagination, the skeleton frame looming grim&#xD;
in the moonlight.     -   '&#xD;
" He that takes the devil into his boat muts&#xD;
ferry him across," quoth Sergeant' Giles.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
THE   EX ECU T,1 ON.&#xD;
Day dawned, and the Continental camp&#xD;
shook off its slumbers. There was a stir&#xD;
among officers and- men. Somert6n looked&#xD;
wearily from his tent. ' He had passed a&#xD;
troubled night. When, after tossing a long&#xD;
time, he finally fell'asleep, his repose-was dis-&#xD;
turbed by the same train of thought that had&#xD;
kept him wakeful. He dreained of -is pris-&#xD;
oner, the young wornan who had visted' him,&#xD;
and Old Hirl, the hunchback.&#xD;
The colonel arose, :depressed by' a heavy&#xD;
consciousness of the disagreeable' duty which&#xD;
the day would bring. Leaving his quarters,&#xD;
-,e took a solitary walk around the outposts&#xD;
&#xD;
of the little camp, still pursued by thoughts,&#xD;
of Guy Deering, and the contradictory char-&#xD;
acter of his last interiew with that misguided&#xD;
person. As he slowly returned, he was mt&#xD;
by Rainford.&#xD;
I" I wait your orders, colonel,"lie said brief-&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
"There is no need of haste. Let him have&#xD;
as much time as possible," Somerton replied.&#xD;
" That was not thought of by our enemies&#xD;
when Hale as minded the cart," returned&#xD;
Rainford.&#xD;
" To their shame be it spoken !" exclaimed&#xD;
omerton. Then, after a pause : "Have you&#xD;
s en him this morning?"&#xD;
" I just looked in to see if he was there,'&#xD;
"How did he appear? Wa3 he less coi&#xD;
tradictpry than ]ist night ?"&#xD;
" The same! 'the same! There was no&#xD;
change in his deportment."&#xD;
"1 I regret'it ! I hoped that solitude and&#xD;
reflection would bring him-to reason."&#xD;
"On the contrary, he was firmer-in his in&#xD;
credible assertions than before. I really be-&#xD;
lieve he thinks to escape, even at this late&#xD;
hour. Truly, his composure is incompre-&#xD;
hensible."&#xD;
" Possibly," said Somerton, " it may arise&#xD;
from a mistaken notion of duty."&#xD;
" That is quite probable ; for the greatest&#xD;
criminals have sometimes been the wildest&#xD;
fanatics, dying-as they imagine-martyrs to&#xD;
right."&#xD;
--Go and ask him," enntinued the colonel,&#xD;
thoughtfully, "if he wishes thio consolations&#xD;
of religion."&#xD;
"'The very question I proposed. He laid&#xD;
his hand upon his breast, and replied that&#xD;
he already experienced such consolation with-&#xD;
in him."&#xD;
"It is passing strange!  Send Sergeant&#xD;
Giles to inform him thdt he 'has but dn hour&#xD;
to live."&#xD;
The sergeant being near, was immediately&#xD;
dispatched on this errand, which he fulfilled&#xD;
with all that military alacrity on which he&#xD;
'prided himself.&#xD;
"Well?"'said Somerton, interrogatively,&#xD;
glancing at his messenger.&#xD;
" He said," replied Giles, "that it was more&#xD;
time than he expected ; and he hoped it would&#xD;
be more than sufficient to prove his inno-&#xD;
cence."&#xD;
Captain Rainford, never celebrated for his&#xD;
gentleness, on hearing this, made use of sun-&#xD;
dry expletives bordering on profanity. Even&#xD;
the-patient Somnerton seemed annoyed by this&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
" Did-he express any desire to see a clergy-&#xD;
man ?" that officer demanded.&#xD;
" When I ventured to hint, your honor,&#xD;
that he ought to have a parson to tinker up&#xD;
his conscience, he shook his head with a sol-&#xD;

emn sort o' smile, and said : ' If I've neglect-&#xD;
ed my soul till now, it's sartinly ,too late to&#xD;
save it ; but if I've attended to it, it will not&#xD;
be desarted at the hour o' death.' Them was&#xD;
his words, and every one of 'em seemed to&#xD;
weigh the matter of a pound."&#xD;
'I have done my duty !" exclaimed Somer-&#xD;
ton. " Captain Rainford, muster the dra-&#xD;
goons. An hour is the utmost grace that can&#xD;
be given. If Tarleton should get wind of&#xD;
what is going on, it wouldn't be strange if he&#xD;
should attempt to rescue. He and Cornwal-&#xD;
lis have been closeted more than, once with&#xD;
Guy Deering, no doubt."&#xD;
Soon the blast of a bugle was heard,, follow-&#xD;
ed by the clanking of sabres, the rattling of&#xD;
spurs, the neighing of horses, and the heavy&#xD;
tramp of dragoons. A part of the brigade&#xD;
was drawn up in the form of a hollow square&#xD;
around the gallows that had been erected the&#xD;
previous night. Inside this phalanx, A cor-&#xD;
re ponding number of more lightly aimed&#xD;
troopers were paraded on foot. All being&#xD;
ready for the terrible drama, a deep and ex-&#xD;
pectant silence ensued.&#xD;
Presently, Sergeant Giles entered the cabin&#xD;
with a file of men, and brought 'out the pris-&#xD;
oner, upon whom every eye was instantly&#xD;
turned. His face was somewhat flushed when&#xD;
he first appeared, but it soon became pale&#xD;
and calm. He advanced firmly and stood in&#xD;
the fatal square, when he paused, and looked&#xD;
slowly around. His glance rested upon Som-&#xD;
erton.&#xD;
" Tell Colonel Somerton," he said, " that&#xD;
I would speak with him a moment."&#xD;
His desire was at once made known to the&#xD;
commanding officer, who reluctantly ap-&#xD;
proached.&#xD;
" Mr. Deering," he said, Â°".I have been in-&#xD;
formed that you have something to say to&#xD;
me."&#xD;
" Much! much!" answered the prisoner,&#xD;
with emphasis.&#xD;
" Say on, then, for the time is brief," said&#xD;
the officer.&#xD;
"'Brief, indeed!" said the spy, quickly. "It&#xD;
would seem that there is but a short quarter&#xD;
of an hour before me.   Although yonder&#xD;
orb" (he pointed to the sun) " will rise and&#xD;
set millions of times, I shall not see it set or&#xD;
rise again. How should you feel, colonel, in&#xD;
my situation ?"&#xD;
"If," returned Somerton, earnestly, " I&#xD;
were dying in my country's cause, with no&#xD;
stain o' my name, I should feel that the smile&#xD;
of God was on me."&#xD;
- "I comprehend," said the prisoner, color-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"Mr. Deering-" the colonel began.&#xD;
" I have told you that my name is Hender-&#xD;
son," interrupted the spy, in a decisive voice.&#xD;
" Henderson or Deering-for it makes little&#xD;
&#xD;
19&#xD;
&#xD;
difference what I call you-if you have aught&#xD;
to communicate, come to the point and be&#xD;
brief. I am disposed to be humane ; but with&#xD;
me duty is imperative."&#xD;
Before answering, the prisoner partially&#xD;
turned, and looked anxiously toward the San-&#xD;
tee, the murmur of whose waters could be&#xD;
heard. Somerton noticed the action, and said,&#xD;
warningly :&#xD;
" Young man, I solemnly believe that you&#xD;
are beyond human aid. If Tarleton and his&#xD;
legion were to appear this moment, you could&#xD;
not be rescued alive. A volley from my men&#xD;
would end all before the foremost of our ene-&#xD;
mies could come to the charge."&#xD;
"I do not expect Tarleton," responded the&#xD;
prisoner, with a smile that seemed a niockery&#xD;
of death.&#xD;
"Do I understand that you have spoken&#xD;
what you wish to say ?" demanded the Conti-&#xD;
nental officer, authoritatively.&#xD;
" No, no !" exclaimed the spy, with a vehe-&#xD;
mence that w'as in striking contrast to his for-&#xD;
mer quietness.&#xD;
"' In Heaven's name speak, then, for the&#xD;
time draws n ar!"&#xD;
" God forbid !  Never, never !" he cried,&#xD;
with more feeling than he had yet exhibited.&#xD;
" Your terrible situation has disordered&#xD;
your mind," replied Somerton, in a troubled&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"It may *o appear to you ; but possibly&#xD;
the time may come-"&#xD;
He stopped, and looked, once more to the&#xD;
south.&#xD;
- " Some false and deceptive hope still sup-&#xD;
ports you. Reject it- abandon it-fling it&#xD;
from you as the enemy of your future peace.&#xD;
Employ the few remaining moments in&#xD;
prayer. Yonder is the chaplain of the brig-&#xD;
ade ; he looks anxiously this way. Permit&#xD;
me to summon him. He waits but for a sig-&#xD;
nal, and I will give it."&#xD;
The colonel waved his hand, and the indi-&#xD;
vidual referred to quickly approached. In&#xD;
person and outward appearance, he bore small&#xD;
resemblance to one's idea of a man of God.&#xD;
He was a large, wiry-looking personage, with&#xD;
brawny hands, thick neck, and swarthy fea-&#xD;
tures, which, instead of that softness and meek-&#xD;
ness generally supposed to characterize his&#xD;
profession, were hard and severe in their ex-&#xD;
pression. Instead of prayer-book or missal,&#xD;
he carried a ponderous sword, and wore be-&#xD;
neath a leather belt a brace of pistols.&#xD;
The risoner regarded him with a faint&#xD;
smile an was about to refuse his services,&#xD;
when so e new thought changed hi, purpose.&#xD;
" Hum brey," said Somerton, " but a few&#xD;
moments a e left to this wretched man. Do&#xD;
for him w at man may do for his fellow-man&#xD;
in a stra' like this."&#xD;
"I an do nothing of myself," answered the&#xD;

stroke across the shoulders ; and then' pro-&#xD;
duced a large snuff-box, took a pinch herself,&#xD;
and then significantly held the box toward&#xD;
the offending Meg, who made a wry face,&#xD;
shrugged her shoulders, and reluctantly took&#xD;
a few grains of the obnoxious powder betweenn&#xD;
her thumb and finger.&#xD;
"Nose!I" said Miss Betsey, imperiously.&#xD;
Meg's hand made a slow journey toward&#xD;
the orgai so laconically mentioned by her&#xD;
mistress.'&#xD;
"She hates it," said the latter, explanator-&#xD;
ily, to the colonel. "It's a way that I have&#xD;
of correctin' her faults, which .are legion ; and&#xD;
the most abominable of which is her entire&#xD;
ignorance of the motions of the wheels o'&#xD;
time."      -&#xD;
"Karshew I" sneezed Meg, which action&#xD;
was followed by a grin irresistibly ludicrous.&#xD;
Somerton smiled-the, dragoons laughed.&#xD;
"Time," observed the colonel,, gravely,&#xD;
perceiving the hobby of Dame Grindle, "is&#xD;
truly not a thing to' be trifled with ; for, be&#xD;
it ever so ill-spent, we cannot recall it to live&#xD;
it over.",                          '&#xD;
The swordmaker, meantime, had drawn'&#xD;
near Betsey Grindle ; and was continuing,&#xD;
from a closer point of observation, the scru-&#xD;
tiny which he had begun at a distance.&#xD;
"Squire Redmond's sister a'n't ye, mum ?"&#xD;
he said, carelessly  "Have seen ye at' the&#xD;
plantation, though my face mayn't'be familiar&#xD;
to ye."&#xD;
Dame Grindle turned suddenly upon the&#xD;
interrogator, whose simple words had evi-&#xD;
dently excited so  interest in her mind.&#xD;
"Don't rememb   seem' ye durin' the whole&#xD;
course e' my life. Have so much to do that&#xD;
I get precious -little opportunity to notice&#xD;
folks that come to our place."&#xD;
"Folks well? How's the young .women?&#xD;
Used' to know Judith. Nice gal! nice gal! !&#xD;
Knew whQ used to hitch his horse to her&#xD;
father's door, but I won't call no names.&#xD;
He's  took to evil courses, they say, since.&#xD;
British gold oughter be like p'ison to an hon-&#xD;
est man."&#xD;
Dame Grindle's ghastly face became, for a&#xD;
moment, red, and her large eyes seemed to&#xD;
emit sparks of fire.&#xD;
"You're not his judge, old man; and, let&#xD;
me tell you, you're speakin' lightly of one-"&#xD;
Betsey Grindle'stopped,&#xD;
" Y,es, you say truly' he was an undutiful&#xD;
son, although I can say, without p'evarication,&#xD;
that he loved the gal. 'Twasn't  common&#xD;
love, neither ; but that-kind that' never goes&#xD;
out, either by fasting or prayer, but lasts o&#xD;
the eend. The poor soul used to exclaim: 'If&#xD;
she on'y knowed me as I.,am! If she eod&#xD;
on'y read my motives ! But she can't-she&#xD;
won't !' Ah, Goody Grindle, you'4 ough er&#xD;
heerd him!"                       -   e&#xD;
&#xD;
'1&#xD;
&#xD;
27&#xD;
&#xD;
By this time the spinster was pale again.&#xD;
A mist and dimness floated before her eyes.&#xD;
She gazed at the swordmaker with wonder-&#xD;
ful earnestness.&#xD;
"I forbid you to speak his name !" she&#xD;
said, with emotion.&#xD;
"My name is Hirl, though ill-mannered&#xD;
people call me Old Hirl, Deef Hirl, Crazy&#xD;
Hirl, and sich," piped the hunchback."&#xD;
"Colonel Somerton," said Dame Grindle,&#xD;
turning sharply upon that officer, "take&#xD;
these things away, if you want 'em, and make&#xD;
judicious distribution of 'em among your dra-&#xD;
goons. Meg ! stop grinnin', and think of the&#xD;
wheels o' time that are every minute rollin'&#xD;
ye to your grave."&#xD;
" Karshew !" responded Meg.&#xD;
"In behalf ofmy dragoons, I thank you,&#xD;
Miss Grindle. God knows the poor fellows&#xD;
need help !" said Somerton, with warmth.&#xD;
"Oh, sir, that's all understood! Don't waste&#xD;
the minutes, for they're 'muazin' short, and go&#xD;
quicker this year nor they did last. There !&#xD;
my business with you is done. Good day,&#xD;
colonel ! Don't say anything more to me,&#xD;
'cause words don't cost nothin', and stockin's&#xD;
do. Next time you meet the Britishers, give&#xD;
'em an extra cut or two for me. That's all I&#xD;
ask."&#xD;
The spinster at that moment appeared to&#xD;
become conscious that many eyes were fas-&#xD;
tened upon her.&#xD;
- "Go off, you rude clowns ! Didn't you&#xD;
never see a woman afore? Ruther run the&#xD;
g'antlet than be stared -at this way.. Pack&#xD;
off, the whole of ye, or not another sock will&#xD;
ye git o' me, if I live to be as old as Methu-&#xD;
salum. Oughter be fightin', too, when time&#xD;
is so precious. There's tories and Britishers&#xD;
enough to keep ye busy'every blessed min-&#xD;
ute."&#xD;
Somerton made a gesture to such of the&#xD;
'dragoons as the scene had drawn together;&#xD;
and they retired, jnuch amused. - He then&#xD;
ordered Corporal Thornton to carry the pack-&#xD;
age to his quarters.&#xD;
"If you wish refreshments, or if I can do&#xD;
you any courtesy," the colonel begat&#xD;
"Don't talk to. me of 'refreshment and&#xD;
courtesy,' when there's sch doin's through-&#xD;
out the length and breadth of the land ! Do&#xD;
you s'pose I can stop to eat and drink, and&#xD;
hear fine speeches, when there's so much&#xD;
knittin' to do, and your men eenamost out to&#xD;
the weather for coats and breeches, and the&#xD;
Lord on'y-knows who's, going' to make 'em, or&#xD;

"Goodomorning," responded the colonel,&#xD;
and walked away..&#xD;

"Whatever you say to me, Guy Deering&#xD;
'shalleear,"-answered the hunchback, with pe-&#xD;
culiar emphasis.&#xD;
' Old man, look at me!. Keep faith with&#xD;
me as you hope to have it kept with you in&#xD;
the most serious things that concern your life&#xD;
and happiness. Take this 'saw and this 'purse:&#xD;
pass the first through a creyice to Deering:&#xD;
put the last in your pocket for the benefit of&#xD;
your wife and children. You have said that&#xD;
you shall work late to-night; udo so in Heav-&#xD;
en's name ! The noise of your hammer will&#xD;
drown the noise of the saw. It is but a small&#xD;
favor for you to grant, but -mueh and momen-&#xD;
totus iii its consequences to him."&#xD;
While the womanwas thus eloquently speak-&#xD;
ing in behalf of the spy, she drew a small saw&#xD;
and a purse from beneath her gown, and prof-&#xD;
fered them to the hunchback. He received&#xD;
the saw, but not the purse. Tears stood in&#xD;
his eyes.s&#xD;
" Woman ! woman! take away your gold&#xD;
I can sarve a feller-creetur without bein' brib-&#xD;
ed to do it. I can~ and I will."&#xD;
"And you will give him the saw ?"&#xD;
"Be as sure that it shall reach the hands of&#xD;
Guy Deering as that you see it in mine."&#xD;
"Good, kind, generous soul! God forever&#xD;
bless you Ah! how can we be conquered&#xD;
when even poor men like you spurn gold.?"&#xD;
"Spurn gold !" repeated the old man, with&#xD;
a s irdonie laugh. "Some say"-he turned&#xD;
from her to hide his emotion.i "Should I see&#xD;
the hunted youth," he added, anon, in a shak-&#xD;
ing voice, "might I ta~ke the liberty to tell&#xD;
him that your niece thinks a deal of im, and&#xD;
don't believe more'n half that is said consarn-&#xD;
in' himV Might I tell him? It would so&#xD;
cheer him-solighten, as 'twere, his'breakin'&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
The swordmaker had by this time turned&#xD;
quite around again, and stood face to face with&#xD;
her, with clasped hands.s.&#xD;
"You ~  ay 1' you may! .ssiire him that&#xD;
Judith I dmond-that is, to 1 hint that my&#xD;
thoughtless niece loves him, iuj spite of-of-'&#xD;
"Hush! 'Sergeanut Giles a mcs the way !"&#xD;
int posed Hirl, in a wiispe . "'Twas very&#xD;

piping tones, "tobring 'em  o camp, for hal&#xD;

drew near. "One with a contain on hi&#xD;

can do a good 'eal yet, if you' improve the&#xD;
time. I'm in a terrible hurry, for there's a&#xD;
power o' work to do when I git home.&#xD;
"Birds of a feather flock together," quoth&#xD;
Giles. "They appear to be very well mean-&#xD;
in' people, but they'd worry me into a con-'&#xD;
sumption if I saw 'em often.'&#xD;
"Meg, horses ! Horses, Meg !" said Dame&#xD;
Grindle.&#xD;
"Nice 'mulatto gal ! Eyes like glass beads,&#xD;
and teeth like pearls. What an old witch for&#xD;
a mistress !" added Giles.&#xD;
"Meg; hand !"&#xD;
Meg held her hand for her mistress to mount&#xD;
from, and received a suggestive stroke from her&#xD;
switch as reward. She then Ieaped nimbly to&#xD;
her own horse ; and after casting a coquettish&#xD;
glance at the sergeant, ambled away after&#xD;
Dame Grindle.&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
THE SWOnDMAKER AT HIS TASK.&#xD;
The hammer of the swordmaker was heard&#xD;
till the small hours of the night. Various&#xD;
kinds of weapons passed 'through his indus-&#xD;
trious fingers. Battered swords, blunted and&#xD;
bent bayonets, ,and even damaged pistol and&#xD;
gun-locks, were sent to his tentfor repairs.&#xD;
ISeveral good-natured fellows offered to assist&#xD;
him in his-labors, which proffers were prompt-&#xD;
ly rejected.&#xD;
l "Every one to his trade," said the old man.&#xD;
1  I might as well mount one of your heavy&#xD;
dragoon horses and go sogerin', as for people&#xD;
that never struck hot iron in their lives to&#xD;
'think o' bein' any sarvice to me. If temper-&#xD;
in' a sword, or restorin' a good edge to a blunt-&#xD;
ed weapon is so mighty easy, there wouldn't&#xD;
be.no need o' y trampin" from one part the&#xD;
country to another. ' Jest keep out o' my way ;&#xD;
t that's all I'll ask. Out o' my tent, every one&#xD;
yon ye!"&#xD;
So the hunchback thumped, and blowed,&#xD;
" nd filed, and polished all alone. The 'senti-&#xD;
y nels that guarded the prisoner looked in 'oc-,&#xD;
i casionally, and when the swordmaker got tired,&#xD;
f took a friendly drink 'with, him from a large&#xD;
rt flask, which, whatever fluid It'contained,was&#xD;
, clearly much to their liking'; for their calls&#xD;
d became more frequent as the night progressed.&#xD;
e 'Old Hirl grew elated with his potations; Ang&#xD;

loaded with smoke. The circumstance star-.&#xD;
tied him at first; b1* quickly recollecting that&#xD;
several fires were still burning, he believed,&#xD;
that was a sufficient explanation of the fact.&#xD;
He did not, howeverie dwagain; but, seat-'&#xD;
ing himself upon a camp-stool, began to re-&#xD;
voie new 'plans of operation'agairist the ene-&#xD;
my. He was soon profoundly absorbed in&#xD;
these calculations, which possibly might have'&#xD;
em poed his brain until sunrise, had not&#xD;
wind' hurled a puff of smoke into his 'ce'&#xD;
He instantly arose,_ and hearing -a dull and&#xD;
ominous roa', snatched hid sword and cap, and&#xD;
ran from the tent.&#xD;
Glancing toward the cabin where the sup-&#xD;
positions Deering had been placed for'safe&#xD;
keeping hesaw lohg tongues of flame darting&#xD;
from the roof. He bounded toward the struc-&#xD;
ture, filled with resentment and surprise. He&#xD;
stupibled over a figure ; it was one of the men&#xD;
who had charge of the prisoner, and who&#xD;
roused himself, muttering a drunken objurh&#xD;
action on whoever had disturbed his repose.&#xD;
Somerton hastened. to the other side of the&#xD;
cabin, and found the other sentinel seated up&#xD;
on the ground, supported by a friendly post,&#xD;
with a' strong odor of rum about his person.&#xD;
The tent of the sword'maker remained where&#xD;
he had reared it, but the sound of his 'ham-&#xD;
mer had ceased. _Impelled by strong curios-&#xD;
ity, the colonel dashed in beneath the awning&#xD;
The swordmaker was lying' upon the earth&#xD;
He was, to all eaparancein a deepran "uiet&#xD;
slumber. While the officer was looking a&#xD;
hima.passing blast turned thefiames toward&#xD;
the tet, and it caught fire. Beside the old&#xD;
man lay a pile of weaponsrbearing marks .&#xD;
his handiwork ; attesting in the most indubi&#xD;
table manner to his industry.&#xD;
S"Strange old man " muttered Somerton&#xD;
Then the thought of the prisoner's danger'o&#xD;
"Up old man !" he added, seizing Hir&#xD;
roughly by the shoulder. "Up I the tent i&#xD;
Burning over your head."&#xD;
'The s    eordmak  yawned, opened hiss eyes&#xD;
and closed them agiii&#xD;
"No quarters-no quarters! Charge 'o&#xD;
'em !"  he murmured.'&#xD;
Someirton caught him by the-collar, 'au&#xD;
raised him to his feet, which awakened hi&#xD;
He started at the col:onel in perplexity.&#xD;
"The cabin and the tent are on fire, o&#xD;
man I' If you are sober enough, andba&#xD;
collected yoursolf, help- me to save Deerin'i&#xD;
T     e      been tampered with-or thee&#xD;
has been gross neglect of 'duty."&#xD;
Somerton' ran to the cabin door, and 'bur&#xD;
it open with a blow of his foot. A secor&#xD;
door still opposed him, and he threw himse&#xD;
desperately against it ; it fell in with a cras&#xD;

in the face, and drove him back. He paused&#xD;
till the first gush' had passed, and the pent&#xD;
gases had found 'momentary vent, and was&#xD;
rushing in again, when the swordmaker-who&#xD;
had followed him-caught him by the arm.&#xD;
"Are you mad, colonel ?" he cried. "No&#xD;
human creetur can live in there a minute."&#xD;
"Let me go, old man ! The prisoner must&#xD;
be saved at any risk, however great. It must&#xD;
never be said that the Americans burn their&#xD;
prisoners."&#xD;
Somerton shook'off the grasp of the sword-&#xD;
maker, and plunged into the whirling vortex&#xD;
of smoke.&#xD;
"Deering ! Deering 1" he called, and groped&#xD;
from corner to corner.&#xD;
He received no answer, and felt vainly for&#xD;
the form of the spy. The carbonic vapors&#xD;
went to his brain and lungs, and struck him&#xD;
down in a moment.' A horrible gasping, chok-&#xD;
ing, dying sensation overpowered him. He&#xD;
seemed to be whirled to and fro like a feather&#xD;
on the ocean. He felt himself death-doomed&#xD;
. ands lost. ,There' was a footstep beside him ;&#xD;
a strong hand lifted hini from the floor. It&#xD;
was  Hirl, who had plunged after him into the&#xD;
Tartarean bath of smoke and fire.&#xD;
'omerton was conscious of, being dragged&#xD;
a few paces ; that his deiverei appeared to&#xD;
strike a passage through the wall with his&#xD;
foot; that fresh' air rushed in ; that he was&#xD;
, drawn through a narrow aperture, and placed&#xD;
on the ground outside the blazing cabin. All&#xD;
t this happened in less time than we have been&#xD;
't relating 'it; and the colonel, after breathing&#xD;
" the pure air a few seconds, was fully aware of&#xD;
d the peril he had escaped, and to whom he&#xD;
if owed his preservation. But Deering was still&#xD;
- uppermost in his mind.&#xD;
" Must he perish? ,Is there no way of reach-&#xD;
. ing him?"' he cried, as soon as he was able to&#xD;
a-speak.&#xD;
The swordmaker was about to reply, when&#xD;
r1 there was a deafening blare of trumpets, and&#xD;
is the ground shook beneath the tread of horses.&#xD;
"A charge'of Cavalry 1-a charge of eaval*&#xD;
s, ry ! The enemy !-the enemy!" shouted Hirl,&#xD;
in a stentorian voice.&#xD;
n    "To horse.!-to horse !" thundered Somer-&#xD;
ton, recovering his energies and self-posses-&#xD;
d sion His 'voice was heard above the din of&#xD;
a. trumpets  and 'the tramp of steeds. Almost&#xD;
simultaneously was heard the firing of the&#xD;
ld outposts, In a moment, the camp was astir.&#xD;
ye There was a hurried seizing of arms, and a&#xD;

of pain, and thought of his dragoons with in-&#xD;
expressible longing.&#xD;
"Go, 'long ! go 'long, Crazy !" said a voice,&#xD;
that was familiar to the Continental officer,&#xD;
who heard, also, the rumbling of a cart.&#xD;
" Dontt 'magine you're goin' to a funeral, do&#xD;
ye? Trhe rheumatics and neuralagy don't&#xD;
trouble ye, do they,'old galf? Hirrup, I say!&#xD;
birrup .'&#xD;
" Tl  swordmaker !" murmured Somerton.&#xD;
" What does he here? He is a false knave,&#xD;
I'll swear!"&#xD;
Meantime, Old Hirl trundled along to the&#xD;
spot where the colonel was lying, and seeing&#xD;
him, stopped his horse. Somerton lay quite&#xD;
Motionless.&#xD;
"One of the rebel creeturs," said Hirl.&#xD;
"Cap'n Hadley's boys have made an eend of&#xD;
him, I reckon. Well, all the rebels must&#xD;
come to it,, sooner or later. The king's lads&#xD;
are cuttin' 'em 'up like Satan ! Git up,&#xD;
Crazy'!"&#xD;
The swordmaker jerked at the reins, and&#xD;
the cart rattled on again.&#xD;
"Old Hirl! Deef Hirl !" cried several&#xD;
voices ; and these exclamations, and others of&#xD;
like character, passed from mouth to mouth.&#xD;
"What you brought us now, old man"&#xD;
demanded Captain Hadley, turning his sinis-&#xD;
ter eyes upon the swordmaker.&#xD;
"Bought a cow? No; there's none to&#xD;
sell, as 1 knows on ! 'Tain't in my line," le&#xD;
answered, with a slightly-injured expression.&#xD;
Some of the tories laughed.&#xD;
"Makin' fun of me, be ye? A  good 'eal o'&#xD;
work 'shall I do for ye, if ye go on this way&#xD;
Not a. puff will I blow for ye, nor a blow will&#xD;
I strike !" added Hirl, petulantly.&#xD;
"They don't mean any hurt," said Hadley,&#xD;
soothingly. "What's the nEws from the rebel&#xD;
camp ?"&#xD;
Somerton heard this interrogatory, and lis-&#xD;
tened with deep interest for the swordmaker's&#xD;
reply&#xD;
"'es, he was a great scamp," re lied the&#xD;
hunchback, pointing to Somerton ;  ut he&#xD;
'pears pooty well out the reach o' misc  f,&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"The old villain !" thought Somerton.&#xD;
"I asked about the dragoons up t&#xD;
river !" shouted Hadlev.&#xD;
"Oh!I They're mightily cut up," replied&#xD;
the old man,:rubbing his hands with satisfac-&#xD;
tion. "There's scarcely one on 'em but got&#xD;
an ugly cut from your fire-eaters, last night.&#xD;
You made monstrous havoc among 'em, I tell&#xD;
ye. There isn't twenty of 'em that can mount&#xD;
a hoe., to-day, 'thout groanin'  You oughter&#xD;
make another dash at 'em while they're stiff&#xD;
from their wounds."&#xD;
"I trusted that man !" murmured Somer-&#xD;
ton. "In these troublous times on whom can&#xD;
we rely ?"&#xD;

"How do they bear the loss of their lead-&#xD;
er ?" screamed Hadley.&#xD;
"It works 'em .up 'mazin'! Cap'n Rain-&#xD;
ford chafes to and fro like awild beast, swear-&#xD;
in' that he'll have him, -dead or alive."a&#xD;
"If he gets him, it will be as yosee him,&#xD;
yonder," returned the tory with a shrug.&#xD;
" Noticed him as I driv along. The breath&#xD;
has gone clean out of him, and he lays there&#xD;
stiff and ghastly. 'Tisn't a pleasant sight&#xD;
about camp ; and it don't bring good luck to&#xD;
have dead men so near, starin' at ye with&#xD;
their glassy eyes." Â°&#xD;
The tory leader glanced toward Somerton,&#xD;
and then turned his face in another direction.&#xD;
"I hate to have a body lookin' at me, as&#xD;
'twere, when I work at nights in my little&#xD;
tent," added the old man, with many dubious&#xD;
shakes of the head. Then, with his eyes fix-&#xD;
ed on the prostrate form of Somerton, he&#xD;
went on: "How have the mighty fallen, and&#xD;
the weepons o' war perished ! Yesterday&#xD;
mornin', this rebel was in full strength, and&#xD;
a terror to the royal troops; now he is cut&#xD;
down as grass, and the cunnin' has departed&#xD;
from his arm. I knowd his mother afore the&#xD;
lad was born. For her sake, I'll jest give&#xD;
him a decent burial; that is, dig a hole at&#xD;
the roots of a tree, and kiver him with mo-&#xD;
ther airth."&#xD;
"Are you sure he's dead ?" asked Hadley.&#xD;
"If you's dead as he is, cap'n, you'd thank&#xD;
sombody to bury ye !" replied the sword-&#xD;
maker impressively. ," If he's alive, I should&#xD;
be the last one to get within reach of his&#xD;
arm ; for he'd strangle me if he was ,,at his&#xD;
last gasp! Seein' me here wouldn't make&#xD;
him over friendly. I'll fling him into my&#xD;
cart, and take him out o' the way ; for the&#xD;
very sight of his body makes me shiver.&#xD;
They say he was proper handy with the tools&#xD;
--his aim was sure, and his blade sharp."&#xD;
"Well, off with him, and make his bed&#xD;
somewhere where it won't be seen too much,"&#xD;
replied Hadley, carelessly, glad to be rid of&#xD;
a dead enemy so easily.&#xD;
Imagine the emotions of Somerton upon&#xD;
hearing this conversation! Horror and in-&#xD;
dignation struggled in his breast.&#xD;
The hunchback turned his cart, muttering&#xD;
s he did so : "If there's a few sparks o' life&#xD;
in him, the clods '11 put 'em out. Yes, the&#xD;
clods '11 put 'em out ; they'll put us all out&#xD;
one o' these days."&#xD;
Hirl turned his cart and approached the&#xD;
colonel, mumbling to himself with the imbe-&#xD;
cility of age.&#xD;
"Rebels don't live long. It's a wicked&#xD;
thing to turn against one's nat'ral king."&#xD;
The wheels of the swordmaker's cart brush-&#xD;
ed Somerton's garments, who had resolved to&#xD;
feign death and trust his chance for escape&#xD;
from the talons of this impromptu grave-C  -&#xD;

"The corporal has lost !  Give him the the narrow vista before them. Her mistress&#xD;

"Guinea!" exclaimed Ilirl, contemptuous- To go on, was like penetrating a labyrinth of&#xD;
&#xD;

ii&#xD;
&#xD;
darkness and uncertainty. Her terrors, which&#xD;
had be   steadily increasing, could no longer&#xD;
be concealed from Meg, upoa whom they acted&#xD;
like a battery, each shock of which thrilled&#xD;
her utterly.&#xD;
"Oh, missus, I knowed somethin' drefful&#xD;
would happen when we started on this yer&#xD;
wil' go su chase. We sha'n't nebber see de&#xD;
plantati -n no moral ! 'Deed, missus, we're as&#xD;

it'll jes' put do finishia' touch to us, and dat's&#xD;
the Lores truth!" Meg'a state of mind was&#xD;
too evi lent to need an interpreter. Instead&#xD;
of inspiring confidence by her presence, her&#xD;
company -was likely to prove anything but&#xD;
-rc-assuring.'&#xD;
"If you don't choose to follow me, you&#xD;
can remain behind," replied Miss Grindle, in&#xD;
as firm a voice as shecould command. She&#xD;
touhe a her horse and moved on, but with a&#xD;
dread and misgiving that fell little short of&#xD;
Meg's.&#xD;
The forest was at that point more dense,&#xD;
and thc.soltude more palpable to the feelings.&#xD;
The path, too, was less defined, and her horse&#xD;
stepped with his nose near the ground. That&#xD;
she had mistaken her way, was a conviction&#xD;
that grew stronger at every step. That she&#xD;
had ridden far enough to reach the planta-&#xD;
tion, she could scarcely doubt ; but persons&#xD;
who begin to feel themselves lost are apt to&#xD;
persevere in the wrong while there is a single&#xD;
shadow of hope. She could see no land-&#xD;
marks to guide her ; she was conscious only&#xD;
of a black wilderness of trees, which swal-&#xD;
lowed up her and her maid like atoms of&#xD;
sand, or two waifs of thistledown.&#xD;
"aMissus," said the mulatto, with chatter-&#xD;
ing teeth, "the path am 'tirely gone, an' we's&#xD;
ridin' 'mong the trees !"&#xD;
This announcement did not surprise the&#xD;
worthy spinster, for she was already con-&#xD;
scious of the fact.&#xD;
"For once in your life, Meg, you're right.&#xD;
We've either reached the ead of the path or&#xD;
lost it. Now don't sit there shakin' like a&#xD;
jelly, but try and be brave. If you don't,&#xD;
I'll cut ye up well when we get home," an-&#xD;
swered Dame Grindle, attempting to spew in&#xD;
her usual manner.&#xD;
"Deed, Miss Bessy, if you'll take one&#xD;
straight hom1e to de plantation, ye may cut&#xD;
me up and welcome ;dfor, ye see, I can stan&#xD;
dat, but I can't stan' dis yer."&#xD;
"Turn your horse, and we'll try and find&#xD;
the way back to the path," said'her mistress&#xD;
"Turn de hoss! Lor' lub ye, Miss Bessy&#xD;
I's turned round ten times in de las' ten miw&#xD;
utes. It don't make no odds which way we&#xD;
goes. Dere's trees die way, an' trees dat way&#xD;
an' trees cberywhere! What's the use tryin'&#xD;
&#xD;
An't no use. Might as well swound right&#xD;
away whar we is as any whar."      -&#xD;
"Swoon, Meg, if you think you'll get out&#xD;
of the woods by it ; but I sha'n't give'up&#xD;
without another trial."&#xD;
Goody Grindle made repeated and con-&#xD;
tinued attempts to recover the lost path,; but&#xD;
every effort involved her in more inextricable&#xD;
labyrinths, until the points of compass were&#xD;
hopelessly'lost. It was at this juncture that&#xD;
Miss Betsey proved herself a woman of nerve&#xD;
and resolution. Doubt in regard to their&#xD;
situation having yielded to certainty, she&#xD;
struggled heroically with her terrors, and&#xD;
tried onet rationally.&#xD;
Perceiving that she was quite as likely t&#xD;
go deeper into the forest as to extricate her-&#xD;
self from it, she proposed to give the rein to&#xD;
her horse, and trust implicitly to his in-&#xD;
stincts. This experiment she at once put in&#xD;
practice ; and the animal, abandoned to his&#xD;
own guidance, snuffed the air, and smelled&#xD;
along the ground, starting off at a moderate&#xD;
pace. Miss Grindle had not proceeded fir&#xD;
in this manner, when a shriek from Meg ex-&#xD;
cited new alarm.&#xD;
" Hush !" said hers mistress, imperatively.&#xD;
"Your noise will bring upon us the very&#xD;
danger that you fear."&#xD;
"Couldn't help it, missus, 'fI's to die! 'a&#xD;
heard somgbod walkin' for two, free min-&#xD;
utes, an' I couldn't squiet myse'f no longer&#xD;
It am right down drefful, missus ! Dar I&#xD;
don't ye hear it ?"&#xD;
"For Heaven's sake, be silent! Your folly&#xD;
makes me angry! It was but a squirrel run-&#xD;
ning over thec leaves."&#xD;
Dame Grindleae'sped the colored girl by&#xD;
the arm, and held it tightly.&#xD;
i "There! don't speak above a whisper!"&#xD;
she added.&#xD;
"Dear me ! how you does take hold. Dar!&#xD;
dar 'tis again! S'pect it am de Pine Rob-&#xD;
bere_"&#xD;
bBetsey Grindle certainly heard a noise that&#xD;
sounded like footsteps not far off.. She set her&#xD;
fingers more rigidly upon the arm of Meg;&#xD;
but physical pain could not neutralize or di-&#xD;
vert her mental disorder; a tell-tale moan&#xD;
-hastened the dreaded catastrophe. The foot-&#xD;
steps which had leen uncertain and cautious,&#xD;
immediately became decided. A figure sud-&#xD;
denly separated itself from the darkness, and&#xD;
t stood beside them. We said that it separated&#xD;
' itself from the darkness ; but this is not&#xD;
strictly true, for the form itself was dark : it&#xD;
3 was a tall, broad-shouldered negro. He seized&#xD;
. both horses by their bridles, and his large,&#xD;
white eyes glared up at mistress and maid&#xD;
,- through the obscurity. Dame Grindle' exp-&#xD;
e r en t'd but one emotion-overpowering ter-&#xD;

THE SWORDMAKER OF THE SANTEE;&#xD;
&#xD;
the marvel had only begun ; the odd creatu&#xD;
bits of iron, in company with hammer, tong&#xD;
and anvil, had a merry dance, to the supreme&#xD;
worriment of the person who ought to hav&#xD;
been a corpse, but wasn't.&#xD;
"Good heavens, old-man ! You might a&#xD;
well put me in a mortar and pound me, as t&#xD;
jolt me over the ground in this way ! Th&#xD;
devil's in that mare !" cried the colonel, pit&#xD;
eously.&#xD;
"Yes, she is possessed at times. Used t&#xD;
call her Mary Magdalen on that account. G&#xD;
*'long ! Hi !hi !"&#xD;
The eccentric creature seemed to be trying&#xD;
to run out of her harness. The trees dashe(&#xD;
by the cart, apparently like race-horses. A&#xD;
steeple-chase was nothing to it. 3omerton&#xD;
was obliged to grasp the sides of a vehicle&#xD;
with both hands.&#xD;
"On'y 'leven year old !" shrieked the old&#xD;
man above the din and clatter. " On'y 'leven&#xD;
year d "&#xD;
The wounded officer looked up appealingly,&#xD;
and saw.Hirt sitting unconcernedly on his&#xD;
perch, with a rein in each hand, his musket&#xD;
between his knees, and his great cart-whip at&#xD;
his feet.&#xD;
The morning sun shone on his hump, mak-&#xD;
ing it look like a hot shot, or a bomb-shell at&#xD;
a white-heat.&#xD;
" People that don't know nothin' 'bout&#xD;
houses, think she's fifteen ; but I know her&#xD;
age to a day. I can trace her generology in&#xD;
a direct line. Her mother was a long, slab:&#xD;
sided, weasly-lookin' animil, and her sire was&#xD;
the most vicious 'creetur that ever broke halt-&#xD;
er or slipped-bridle. Crazy's low in flesh&#xD;
this summer, but jest turn her'out a few days,&#xD;
and give her a pile of oats, and she'll show ye"&#xD;
a trick or two when your business is pressing '&#xD;
and there's danger afore, an' ahind, an' all&#xD;
round.",&#xD;
. Hirl stopped so suddenly, that every article&#xD;
in the cart, the colonel not excepted, plunged&#xD;
forward against the head-board. -Shriek after&#xD;
shriek came from the forest ;'it was a woman's&#xD;
voice. T'he hunchback sprang;fr'om hips heat&#xD;
like a rocket, and the colonel saw him running&#xD;
swiftly to the left, with his musket. His&#xD;
curiosity rose above -his pains. He saw fig-&#xD;
ures half hidden by the trees, and the flutter&#xD;
of female garments. The forms came nearer ;&#xD;
they were women flying from pursuers, and&#xD;
the cries he had heard were uttered by them.&#xD;
The swordmaker flew wildly to meet the&#xD;
fugitives, who were no other than Dame&#xD;
Grindle and her maid Meg. The cause of&#xD;
theirterror was immediately manifest; the&#xD;
two marauders, Martin and Flander&amp;amp;, were&#xD;
hotly pursuing them.&#xD;
" Go on, gals! Go on !" said Hirl, passing&#xD;
them, and stopping 'behind a tree. "Go on,&#xD;
&#xD;
re and I'll have a settlement with these skin-&#xD;
us ners."&#xD;
's,  "'Tis the swordmaker ! 'tis the sword-&#xD;
ec maker " exclaimed the suppositious Dame&#xD;
re Grindle ho had resumed her gray hair and&#xD;
cap, an  etreated again into the almost myth-&#xD;
as ical dep hs of her bonnet.&#xD;
o    "It am de debble,- more like, missus, id&#xD;
.e all dat yer on his back !" asserted Meg, on&#xD;
t- whose mind the startling incidents of the&#xD;
night and morning had made deep impres-&#xD;
o sion.&#xD;
o   Both paused, partly from exhaustion, partly&#xD;
from bewilderment. Possibly they feared that&#xD;
g the old man could not contend with the two.&#xD;
d While they stood panting and gazing at the&#xD;
hunchback with swimming, dizzy incredulity,&#xD;
 he aimed his musket and fired. When the&#xD;
e smoke cleared away, neither of the villains&#xD;
were to be seen, but footsteps' were heard&#xD;
3 growing every moment less distinct. Judith&#xD;
thought she heard groans, also, but was too&#xD;
much disturbed to dwell long upon the subject.&#xD;
The color receded from her face, andthe&#xD;
swordmaker hastened to place his arm about&#xD;
her waist to support her ; for Meg, in a military&#xD;
point of view, was quite demoralized.&#xD;
"Strange, strange, that I should encounter&#xD;
you here !" murmured Judith, sighing and&#xD;
trembling on the verge of unconsciousness.&#xD;
" Nothin' extr'ordiner, Goody Grindle. My&#xD;
trade carries me everywhere e'enamost," an-&#xD;
swered the swordmaker, drawing Judith closer&#xD;
to him.&#xD;
"True! true !"~returned Judith, recovering,&#xD;
and reinenbering the character in which she&#xD;
was figuring. " There ! that 'll do, my good&#xD;
man," she added, returning to the Betsey&#xD;
Grindle voice and manner.&#xD;
"Don't waste precious time in holdin' up a&#xD;
woman when there's no danger of her fallin'."&#xD;
" In the name of God-" began the sword-&#xD;
maker, with remarkable earnestness.&#xD;
Judith looked at him wonderingly.&#xD;
" I mean - why is this, Goody Grindle ?&#xD;
What in the name o' reason are you wanderin'&#xD;
here for? Why ain't ye at home, at the&#xD;
spire's ?" j&#xD;
" We's jes' been el'ar done lost," interposed&#xD;
Meg. " De Lor' only knows what missus has&#xD;
underwent, and what I's underwent. We's&#xD;
seen de debble hisself; and we's been chas I&#xD;
Golly gracious, how we has been chased !"&#xD;
The swordmaker trembled like a leaf. I is&#xD;
face was pale as snow.&#xD;
" What's the matter ?" cried Judith, wh se&#xD;
sympathy for others was always active.&#xD;
11 He's goin' to swound, I s'pect," sugg ted&#xD;
Meg.&#xD;
"In the forest-all night-alone!"    e&#xD;
stopped ; then resumed, in his accustomed&#xD;
manner. "'Twas right lucky, my stumblin'&#xD;

P               leading to the, house. This was a discovery,&#xD;
indeed  It was well for them it was not made&#xD;
;'                 too late. Judith sensibly beat a retreat with-&#xD;
out so much as a shriek or a fainting-fit, and&#xD;
Meg had just enough discretion to keep close&#xD;
(~  ~4~.to her mistress. The runaway black was cvi.&#xD;
gently there for no good purpose. He was&#xD;
either waiting their return, or making a sur-&#xD;
vey of the premises with a view to plunder&#xD;
and pillage ; very likely he had both these&#xD;
objects in contemplation. It was necessary,&#xD;
to avoid Jaffer, to make a long detour to the&#xD;
Santee, and this they undertook to do, which&#xD;
could have been accomplished with time and&#xD;
patience, had not a new difficulty prevented, t&#xD;
which took the shape of Christian Hadley and p&#xD;
a dozen of his lawless followers, who-having t&#xD;
arrived as near the plantation as' was thought s&#xD;
safe,*'halted in a growth of express to makea ii&#xD;
reconnoisance on foot. On account of this t&#xD;
-        circumstance, mistress and maid found them- t&#xD;
selves between two perils, neither of which e&#xD;
were anticipated. They could not traverse w&#xD;
the open space between- the      sses and 'a&#xD;
plantation without bemg seen, and they could s&#xD;
not very well make a circuit around the party L&#xD;
by reason of a cane-brake in the rear; so be- in&#xD;
tweenJaffer and Christian Hadley (who was p&#xD;
not a bit of a Christian),, they were placed in p&#xD;
a ver   embarrassing dilemma. It may be th&#xD;
thou  by some that pretty young ladies who h&#xD;
"  ,1.R " 1 fascinate folks in novels, cani do without food ut&#xD;
and drink without a-great deal of inconven- ly&#xD;

mg in their case untrue ; for they were really&#xD;
the worse -for fasting and running like dis- I&#xD;
tracted. creatures -through the tangled thick-&#xD;
ets of the forest. Judith was not so ethereal gu&#xD;
as to rise albve the wants of nature, and long ne&#xD;
Abstinence was telling upon her strength.&#xD;
;  i  $' {Our heroine would have eaten heartily, if all&#xD;
"   ' .  f'she had had a chance ; and it would have been, rep&#xD;
considering the exertion yet required of her,&#xD;
-    ,;l   -       a very sensible thing. But little of the prim- wvit]&#xD;
ness and precision of her assumed character A&#xD;
remained, so far as apparel had to do with it. Gu&#xD;
Her gown was rent in many places ; her high- Da&#xD;
r  heeled shoes and yesterday immaculate hose,&#xD;
' " ~were soiled with the black mud of the swamp, of&#xD;
T"'                    and her not ample skirts, short as they were, ly&#xD;
were wretchedly painted with the same un- at&#xD;
z   4 Â°              lovely pigment. Neither mistress nor maid mig&#xD;
would have ben thought angels in a drawing- But&#xD;
room at that time. But fear is a marvelous que&#xD;
blunter of appetite and fastidiousness. Both  .A&#xD;
might possibly have forgotten the pressing She&#xD;
demands of appetite, had not weakness ad-    "&#xD;
monished them of the fact. Hiding like par- sore&#xD;
bridges in the bushes, they heard nothing for com&#xD;
&#xD;
nd time but the thumping of their own hearts.&#xD;
By-and-by, Judith's natural courage revived,&#xD;
and she began to debate the best method of&#xD;
reaching home. It was precarious moving in&#xD;
any direction ; but Judith felt the imperative&#xD;
necessity of warning her father and his house-&#xD;
hold of the calamity that impended. Fears&#xD;
for her personal safety were in a measure coun-&#xD;
terbalanced by an unselfish solicitude for her&#xD;
friends.nShe remembered that she had been&#xD;
out all night, too, and that the greatest anxi-&#xD;
ety must ie felt for her safety, which her press&#xD;
enee would at once relieve.&#xD;
She watched the cypress-trees and the bot-&#xD;
tom-land a long time; but Jaffer kept at his&#xD;
post, and she could see the horses of the&#xD;
ories grazing near thecanebrake, and a man&#xD;
standing guard over their movements. Jud-&#xD;
th commenced a cautious retrograde toward&#xD;
he wagon-road, where she had parted with&#xD;
he sword-maker. Meg, though quitedejecth.&#xD;
d, was guided by her superior judgment&#xD;
ithout question.. They climbed a hedge,&#xD;
nd stood in the road. They had gained .&#xD;
omething,- being farther from both enemies.&#xD;
looking up the wagon-road, Judith saw a man&#xD;
n a slouched hat and blue camp-cloak, ap-&#xD;
roaching with hurried strides. Her firstim-&#xD;
ulse was, to fly ; but something familiar in&#xD;
he gait and person of the new-comer cared&#xD;
er to remain-irresolute. The mflnmsaw her,&#xD;
vtered an exclamation of surprise, and eager-&#xD;
* advanced. Various emotions chained her&#xD;
the spot. She would have been troubled&#xD;
designate the predominant feeling of her&#xD;
.art. She felt pleasure, surprise, and fear.&#xD;
Guy Deering sprang to her side, and took&#xD;
he unresisting hand in his.&#xD;
" Judith," he said, "this is a pleasure that&#xD;
did not expect."s              u&#xD;
"You know me, then, through my die-&#xD;
ise ?" she said, with a faint glow of happi-&#xD;
ss.&#xD;
" Love-cannot be deceived; it looks through&#xD;
disguise as though it were transparent,"&#xD;
plied Deering.&#xD;
'Andy' t I have passed for Dame Grindle&#xD;
th those hose eyes are not of the dullest.&#xD;
quaint   d hunchback, who knows you,&#xD;

" One does not always know the thouih.s&#xD;

at the sweet face that was already blushing&#xD;
his earnestness.  "The    a y1 swordmaker&#xD;
ght have been wiser than you thought him.&#xD;
t tell-me, Judith, why you are thus ms-&#xD;
rading?'      ,       u        s&#xD;
A glow on the maiden's cheeks deepened.&#xD;
reflected before answering.&#xD;
It seems to me," she said, "that you know&#xD;
thing of this without my telling. It&#xD;

'OR, HIRLTHE x&#xD;
is a mysterious connection between you and&#xD;
the old man Hirl. He gave you the saw, he&#xD;
refused gold, and a strange emotion shook&#xD;
him as I appealed to his sympathy for the&#xD;
spy.,&#xD;
"It was not an ingenuous question," an-&#xD;
swered Deering, in a deep and kindly voice,&#xD;
"to ask concerning this disguise. Yes, Judith,&#xD;
I know what you have done. The old man&#xD;
whispered it to me through the cabin wall,&#xD;
and my admiration and gratitude were such&#xD;
that I wished to lie down at your feet and die&#xD;
for you. Did the old churl tell you ?"&#xD;
"Churl! For shame, Guy! Call him not&#xD;
such a- name," exclaimed Judith. "He is a&#xD;
noble old man, and a deep. - He saved you, he&#xD;
saved Somerton, and he has saved me ."&#xD;
"1Sich a hoss as dat ycr mare is, nebber was&#xD;
seen! She goes an' she goes as though the&#xD;
debble hisse'f was in dem legs o' hern !" in-&#xD;
terposed Meg, who was disposed to be elo-&#xD;
quent respQecting Hirl's mare. "He's jest the&#xD;
queerest old grandaddy! Sometimes le&#xD;
squeaks like a fife ; den agi'n, his v'ic rus&#xD;
el'ar down into his stomich like a bassoon.&#xD;
Sometimes he can't hear t'under den, bime-&#xD;
by, he'll hear de soft little vice o' Miss Ju-&#xD;
dith. 'Deed he will !"&#xD;
Guy Deering smiled.&#xD;
" Those bright eyes were not given the&#xD;
wench for nothing," he said; then turning&#xD;
seriously to Judith, added : " Why are you&#xD;
here ?  Were you not instructed to cross th&#xD;
clearing, and reach home without delay?&#xD;
What has happened? You could not haye&#xD;
been intercepted by the stories, for they wen&#xD;
not that way. They should be concealed i&#xD;
that wood."&#xD;
" We encountered a horrible danger. Tha&#xD;
black demon, Jaffer, of whose enormities yo&#xD;
have heard, and from whose hands we escape&#xD;
last night, was lying in wait down in  te&#xD;
tom-lad beside th e brook. Weh atemt&#xD;
cog    rudb      h   iebtwr       n epted by the outlaw Hadley. This is why&#xD;
am here. Now it is my turn to question&#xD;
Why do you tarry in the midst of danger&#xD;
There is a price on your head! You a&#xD;
like Cain ; he that finds you may slay yo&#xD;
0 Guy Deering! was it for this that I lovi&#xD;
you, with your noble powers, your genero&#xD;
impulses ? Hpow could you, aopt aies&#xD;
famous? If you must indeed be an eney&#xD;
freedom, why not enter the ranks and fig&#xD;
like a man for your cause ? One may respe&#xD;
an open enemy."&#xD;
Deering's head sank lower and lower,11&#xD;
his chin rested upon his chest. He sigh&#xD;
and looked at Judith as one asking pity a&#xD;
mercy.&#xD;
"6 Spies," he muttered, " are the indispe&#xD;
able attendants of  ar  hey arehemin&#xD;
&#xD;
camp of Washington, and in the campon&#xD;
Cornwallis. If we do according to our con-&#xD;
sciences, what matters our employment ?"&#xD;
" Leave me, Guy Deering! leave me for-&#xD;
ever !" cried Judith, with sudden vehemence-.&#xD;
"Never come into my presence again. You&#xD;
are infamous ! you are infamous!"&#xD;
Judith shrank from Deering, shuddering&#xD;
and angry.&#xD;
Deenn s face grew pallid.  All the life&#xD;
seemed to have gone out of his athletic body.&#xD;
There was nofnoisture in his eyes ; they were&#xD;
eald and glassy, and fixed vacantly on Judith.&#xD;
His hinds hung at his side dspairingl -,He&#xD;
heard the words "Infamous ! infamous !"ring-&#xD;
ing in his cars. He knew what voice uttered&#xD;
them/; that was what struck him to the heart.&#xD;
While he felt the steel, he would have kissed&#xD;
the hand that struck.&#xD;
Judith grew handsomer, taller, stro _,&#xD;
prouder, braver, and more adorable. Pres-&#xD;
ently, Deering raised his hands with the .&#xD;
palms turned entreatingly to Judith. The&#xD;
3 motion was teribly eloquent.* She inter-&#xD;
preted the meaning.&#xD;
"Spare you? No! Have you spared me?&#xD;
Have you not turned my love into a curse?&#xD;
Have I not borne contumely and reproach&#xD;
for you ? 0 Guy Deering ! if you had died in&#xD;
the battles of liberty, I should have been,&#xD;
g spared this agony-this blushing, burning,&#xD;
blighting shame !"&#xD;
u   The spy raised his hands higher, till they&#xD;

t Judith stood panting and flashing at him&#xD;
an like lightning. -&#xD;
n I have done with weakness," she went on.&#xD;
at " This confession from you and its lame justi-&#xD;
u fication has opened my eyes. I will pray for&#xD;
d you-I will try to forgive you; but with my&#xD;
t- consent we shall never meet again. Go, Guy&#xD;
d Deering, to those miscreants in whose unholy&#xD;
,r- service you are, and forget Judith Redmond."&#xD;
I   The measured gallop of horses was heard.&#xD;

r? greater calamity could happen.&#xD;

ed   " Go !" said Judith. "It may be those&#xD;

La-  Deering did not stir. Judith looked up the&#xD;
of wagon-road, and saw two horsemen ; they&#xD;
;ht were Sergeant Giles and the chaplain.&#xD;
et    "Go! go !" cried Judith. "They are ene-&#xD;
mies indeed, for they are from Somerton's&#xD;
till camp. To me, they bring safety, to you,&#xD;

ad    " Death!" repeated Deering, in a hollow&#xD;
voice. "Yes, it is death ; I have received&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
IN WhiCa SOMERTON IS MYSTIFIED.&#xD;
Somerton was glad to be left alone. The&#xD;
st twenty-four hours had been with him a&#xD;
riod of peculiar trial and danger. He had&#xD;
en wounded, and in the hands of an un-&#xD;
tying enemy, deprived of those cares which&#xD;
s situation required, without medical aid,&#xD;
d stretched upon the cold earth in an ap-&#xD;
rently lying state. After a perilous and&#xD;
citing escape, occupying several hours, he&#xD;
length found himself beneath a friendly&#xD;
of, upon a soft, inviting couch, with kind,&#xD;
tentive faces looking in upon him.&#xD;
The vomluilitJ of the, to him, inexplicable&#xD;
a  - crindle,*had interested at first, as well&#xD;
perpiexed him; but, presently, weakness&#xD;
d sleep overpowered him. Dame Grin-&#xD;
e's voice seemed to grow lower and low-&#xD;
and recede in the distance; the hump&#xD;
the swordmaker looked like a mountain in&#xD;
mist, so far off that its summit could scarce-&#xD;
be discerned ; the sergeant vanished with a&#xD;
overb ; the chaplain went down through&#xD;
e floor, or up through the roof, like a grim&#xD;
agon, he could not tell which ; but the form&#xD;
Judith Redmond now came, now went, now&#xD;
urned and floated around him fantastically.&#xD;
he soldier slumbered. The old-fashioned&#xD;
l marked three hours of time. The dark-&#xD;
ss of night had set in., A crash of musketry&#xD;
ade Somerton start suddenly from his sleep.&#xD;
.e sound called him to duty and to danger.&#xD;
r a moment, he believed himself at his&#xD;
arters, in camp, beset by the enemy.&#xD;
' Mount, boys! mount, and at them !" he&#xD;
uttered .&#xD;
A soft hand was laid upon his brow, and&#xD;
head pressed gently back to the pillow.&#xD;
.e clouds of sleep were dispelled, and the&#xD;
ntinental officer beheld a fair creature&#xD;
endingg over him.&#xD;
" Is it you? Is it you ?" he murmured.&#xD;
" Yes, it is I," said a soothing voice.&#xD;
"Alas! fair girl, you will make more&#xD;
unds than you will heal!1" sighed. Somer-&#xD;
n.&#xD;
&#xD;
" You are pleased to be as gallant in lady's&#xD;
bower as in the field," answered his charming&#xD;
nurse.&#xD;
" I am a soldier, and have not learned the&#xD;
follies and flatteries of the courtier. My life&#xD;
is an earnest and precarious one, which the&#xD;
vicissitudes of my calling may at any time&#xD;
shorten. I have neither leisure nor disposi-&#xD;
tion for vain compliments. I trust I shall be&#xD;
pardoned when I say, that our first meeting&#xD;
made an impression upon me that I cannot&#xD;
forget."&#xD;
The young lady retreated a step, and look-&#xD;
ed at the colonel, inquiringly.&#xD;
" What did you observe, sir?" she asked.&#xD;
"That our short and singular interview&#xD;
produced feelings, that to me are new and&#xD;
strange."&#xD;
" Interv  -A do not comprehend."&#xD;
His lovely nurse contemplated him as if she&#xD;
feared he were losing his senses.&#xD;
"Do not distrust my prudence, Mss Red-&#xD;
mond. I will keep faithfully your secret; but&#xD;
it pains me to the heart that your visit had&#xD;
not a worthier object. I hope it was pity&#xD;
alone for a human being in distress, that con-&#xD;
ducted you to one condemned to death, and&#xD;
branded with deserved infany."&#xD;
Somerton's voice was low and earnest ; lie&#xD;
watched Miss Redmond s couintSnace with&#xD;
feverish anxiety.&#xD;
"Be quiet, sir; your mind is distempered.&#xD;
Believe me, all that you are saying is but a&#xD;
dream. - This. to my knowledge, is the first&#xD;
time you ever beheld me."&#xD;
Miss Redmond had the manner of perfect&#xD;
truth. Somerton's countenance changed.&#xD;
" I am sorry," he said, with a disappointed&#xD;
air, " that Miss Redmond should fear to trust&#xD;
me, and resorts to prevarication with one&#xD;
whose honor should not be doubled by her."&#xD;
"I assure you, sir, that there is some mis-&#xD;
take," she said.&#xD;
' Mistake ? Impossible ! If I dreamed all&#xD;
this, I am dreaming still. The dream must&#xD;
have commenced at my quarters, at the mo-&#xD;
ment when you came to request permission to&#xD;
see the spy, Decring. The illusion went on&#xD;
when Deering denied that he was Deering.&#xD;
The burning cabin, the surprise, the man&#xD;
riding at my side, my capture, my wounds,&#xD;
my sufferings, my escape, were all of a piece,&#xD;
and arrant deceptions each ! Pray, Miss Red-&#xD;
mond, may I not be permitted to believe that&#xD;
you are real, and that this scene belongs to the&#xD;
waking part of my existence ?"&#xD;
The colonel raised himself on his elbow,&#xD;
and fixed his eyes piercingly upon the chang-&#xD;
ing countenance of Miss Redmond.&#xD;
"You-you confuse me beyond measure.&#xD;
I know not what to say ; but rest assured,"&#xD;
she added, with some hauteur, "that I never&#xD;

visited Colonel Somerton's quarters for any&#xD;
purpose whatever, or at any time in my life.&#xD;
This conceit comes of fever and pain."&#xD;
"I am mad, perhaps i" answered Somerton,&#xD;
with an ironical smile.&#xD;
"It is not singular that your mind should&#xD;
wander somewhat after the scenes throutch&#xD;
which you have recently passed," observed&#xD;
Miss Redmond, quietly.&#xD;
"I am mocked.!"&#xD;
" Who mocks you ?"&#xD;
"Deering, the swordmaker, Dame Grindle,&#xD;
and you ! Yes, you, you mock me !" exclaim-&#xD;
ed the colonel, impatiently.&#xD;
" Nay, nay, good sir ! Be patient, and all&#xD;
shall be as you say. If it be your pleasure,&#xD;
I will assent that I have been anywhere you&#xD;
wish. Be good, and take some of this liquid&#xD;
which my aunt has prepared for you; it will&#xD;
benefit you, I am sure."&#xD;
" I am neither delirious nor wandering,"&#xD;
replied Somerton, with empressement, " and I&#xD;
will spare you the trouble, my dear young&#xD;
lady, of treating me as if I were such. Par-&#xD;
don me, let me understand you. You were&#xD;
not at my quarters?"&#xD;
"Consequently, e was no interview be-&#xD;
tween us?"&#xD;
There was not."&#xD;
"You deny the whole transaction?"&#xD;
,"I deny what you affirm."&#xD;
"Then, by Heaven, I am mad !" cried the&#xD;
officer, with vehemence.&#xD;
There was another crash of musketry near-&#xD;
er than before. The house shook-the panes&#xD;
of glass rattling in the sashes. The well&#xD;
known dissonance aroused the colonel's mar-&#xD;
tial ardor.&#xD;
"That volley was fired by my dragoons!"&#xD;
be said. "There is a fierce engagement not&#xD;
far from here. I must fly to my brave fel-&#xD;
lows. Lend me your arm. Give me my coat&#xD;
and sword !"&#xD;
"My dear sir, you are wounded; you can-&#xD;
not mount horse or wield weapon," remon-&#xD;
strated the young woman.&#xD;
I can do both! This couch is a bed of&#xD;
thorns while I can hear my dragoons at work,&#xD;
and not be with them."&#xD;
Thc officer sat upon the bed, his feet rest-&#xD;
ing upon the floor. le stood up and found&#xD;
himself weaker than he had expected.&#xD;
"I will compromise with you," said Miss&#xD;
Redmond.   " Here is my father's dressing-&#xD;
gown y put it on, and I will assist you to a&#xD;
window, where you may see as much of the&#xD;
conflict as the darkness will permit."'&#xD;
"I believe I am in your power, Miss Red-.&#xD;
mond, and I surrendered at discretion ; only&#xD;
substitute my coat for the gown-for I hate&#xD;
*dressing-gowns. The sleeve is cut open, but&#xD;
you can pin it. You comply. Thank you,&#xD;
&#xD;
miss ! How deftly you women handle us&#xD;
awkward fellows."&#xD;
" You love your buttons, colonel, as well as&#xD;
a young girl her mirror. You are sure you&#xD;
are quite rational? You won't harm me?"&#xD;
Miss Redmond, with some lesitation, as-&#xD;
sisted him to a window that looked toward&#xD;
the Santee.&#xD;
"IIHarm her !" muttered the officer, as he&#xD;
walked by her side.&#xD;
"Fear not," he said, raising his voice. "I&#xD;
am rational, and truthful, also," he added, in&#xD;
an aside tone.&#xD;
The young woman heard him, and seemed&#xD;
to feel the implication deeply.&#xD;
From the window, Somerton beheld an ex-&#xD;
citing spectacle. Some barns and several&#xD;
negro huts had been fired, and the flames&#xD;
lighted up with vividness the space between&#xD;
Redmond's residence and the river, which was&#xD;
now the scene of a fierce nocturnal conflict.&#xD;
Parties of horsemen were seen charging this&#xD;
way and that, sometimes in the full glare of&#xD;
the flaming buildings, at others in the faint&#xD;
and more distant gleam of the fiery illumina-&#xD;
tion. There was a dropping fire of muskets&#xD;
and pistols, while sabres clash d, and the re-&#xD;
sounding notes of bugles rolled across the&#xD;
field. The combatants swayed and wavered&#xD;
to and fro. Now the tide of battle flowed&#xD;
his way, then ebbed back with a sudden im-&#xD;
pulse. Half-naked negroes were seen run-&#xD;
ning to and fro in the foreground of the fight,&#xD;
and riderless horses dashed frantically from&#xD;
the melee.&#xD;
Sergeant Giles, the chaplain, and a few&#xD;
armed blacks, with a half-dozen dragoons,&#xD;
constituted the sole guard and protection of&#xD;
Redmond and his household. Dame Grindle's&#xD;
voice was heard admonishing the slaves to&#xD;
stand'their ground, and do their duty, on pain&#xD;
of after penalties.&#xD;
Colonel Somerton looked out upon the.&#xD;
chaos of battle a few moments in silence.&#xD;
"What do you make of it ?" asked Miss&#xD;
Redmond, timidly.&#xD;
"Rainford is engaged with the headlong&#xD;
Tarleton. Those, are his fellows in the bright&#xD;
coats. They are better fed and clothed than&#xD;
our lads, but not so hearty. I hate scarlet&#xD;
coats! There is a sort of vanity in them that&#xD;
suits John Bull, but which I can never for-&#xD;
give."&#xD;
"The dragoons are giving ground ; they&#xD;
are being overpowered by numbers," said&#xD;
Miss Redmond.&#xD;
" Yes, they are yielding ; but they dispute&#xD;
every inch as they go. There! ~that was&#xD;
Rainford's shout ; he hurls his dragoons once&#xD;
more against the heavy ranks of the enemy.&#xD;
Now, there is hot work ! They slowly re-&#xD;
treat, pressed backward, by the solid masses&#xD;
of Tarleton's legion. How vexatious to be&#xD;

"What ails the mau that he keeps repeatin'&#xD;
things like a Igrrot?  Lord, niece! why do&#xD;
you tremble so ?"&#xD;

fori you that I was not Judith, but Miriam."&#xD;
"NotJudith, but Miriam!" echoed' Somer-&#xD;
ton, dubiously. Then a joyful light broke&#xD;
.over his countenance.&#xD;
"-Forgive me! oh, forgive me !  Before&#xD;
Heaven, I meant not to deceive !" protested&#xD;
Miriam, hiding her face.&#xD;
" The deception," ans-vered Somerton, " was&#xD;
my own. Forgive you? Angels do not sin."&#xD;
" There isn't an angel in the thirteen colo-&#xD;
nies !" affirmed Goody Grindle.&#xD;
" I must differ with you, madam," replied&#xD;
Somerton.&#xD;
"How ludickerous to stan' talkin of angels&#xD;

my nieces are angels, and they won't be, in a&#xD;

love to one of 'em as 'tother. Much as I can&#xD;
do to tell 'em apart. It's the fortinest thing&#xD;
in the world that this one squints a little. I&#xD;
should be bothered to death to 'stinguish 'em&#xD;
if she didn't." .h&#xD;
" Squint, aunt!'*&#xD;
Miriam looked at Goody Grindle with some-&#xD;
thing like consternation.&#xD;
"I haven't observed anything of the kind,"&#xD;
remarked Somerton.&#xD;
"Noticed it the fust time I seen her. The&#xD;
gal's eyes are a good 'eal,out o' plumb-some-&#xD;
times," corroborated Hirl.&#xD;
"-Go 'long, you old camef" retorted Dame&#xD;
Grindl'e. "Child ! child ! vhat makes you&#xD;
tremble?  What is the matter?    Colonel&#xD;
Somerton, what have you done to my niece?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" I have done what mortal man may be&#xD;
pardoned for doing," he answered, with a&#xD;
warmth and earnestness that appeared quite&#xD;
uncalled for to the practical aunt.&#xD;
" I fear," said Miriam, " that I have forfeit-&#xD;
ed your esteem." She looked timidly into&#xD;
his face.&#xD;
" Pardon me, dame," replied Somerton ;&#xD;
and, stooping, whispered in Miss Redmond's&#xD;
ear :&#xD;
" I swear to you it is the happiest mistake&#xD;
of my life ! Be assured-be calm. Judith is,&#xD;
perhaps, beyond my reach; but you, you I-&#xD;
may hope for. God has not left me to de-&#xD;
spair.&#xD;
"There !" said Betsey Grindle, dryly, "I&#xD;
can understand the phenomeny of the gown&#xD;
not bein' burnt around the waist !"&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
DEB HADLEY'S CABIN.&#xD;
We return to Judith, whose sudden and&#xD;
continued absence had created the greatest&#xD;
alarm and anxiety among her friends, who&#xD;
hailed her return with joy- after she had&#xD;
been escorted by the swordmakcr within a'&#xD;
short distance of the house.&#xD;
In answer to the hurried questioning of&#xD;
her father and aunt, she said that she had&#xD;
been to 'Somerton's camp; to carry a few ar-&#xD;
ticles of clothing which Miss Grindle had pre-&#xD;
pared for the use of the soldiers ; and her ab-&#xD;
sence would scarce have been remarked had&#xD;
she not unfortunately become lost in the Pine&#xD;
Forest, where she passed a night of perplexi-&#xD;
ty and terror, from which she had, been re-&#xD;
lieved by the friendly interposition of Hirl,&#xD;
the Hunchback. She did not of course refer&#xD;
to Deering ; and therefore, the real design of&#xD;
her visit remained a secret, as well as the dis-&#xD;
guise she had assumed. The times were so&#xD;
fraught with adventure, so crowded with stir-&#xD;
ring events, that the members of her house-&#xD;
hold found little time to rebuke her rashness,&#xD;
or talk of the risk she had incurred. In those&#xD;
days, stagnation was unknown, and incident&#xD;
followed incident in rapid succession; and&#xD;
while Judith was yet engaged in relating such&#xD;
portions of her mishap as she thought pru-&#xD;
dent, it was announced by the frightened&#xD;
slaves that there was trouble in the cypresses.&#xD;
This, startling as it was, proved a present re-&#xD;
lief to Judith ; for each hurried, as 'by one&#xD;
impulse,-to'-positions from which they could&#xD;
best observe the conflict. Then came Somer-&#xD;
ton to make a new diversion, and put the phi-&#xD;
lanthropic fingers of Aunt Grindle to active&#xD;
service. That officer, having sank into a&#xD;
slumber, as duly mentioned in the order in&#xD;
which these events occurred, Judith availed&#xD;
herself of the temporary lull of indoor ex-&#xD;
citement, to seek that rest which her weary&#xD;
and worn condition rendered imperative, while&#xD;

her sister, Miriam, was left to watch at the&#xD;
bedside of Somerton.&#xD;
The din of battle aroused Judith, banished&#xD;
the idea of further repose, and caused her to&#xD;
hurry with the other members of the family&#xD;
to learn the reason of this new and more thrill-&#xD;
ing interruption. Soon the huts and barns&#xD;
began to burn ; and she beheld the same&#xD;
startling spectacle of warring horsemen and&#xD;
flashing steel that Somerton and his fair&#xD;
guardian witnessed from the window. Judith&#xD;
and Goody Grindle were standing upon the&#xD;
lawn at the left wing of the mansion, when&#xD;
the attack was made upon Giles and his hand-&#xD;
ful of dragoons. She was clinging to that&#xD;
decisive lady, watching with filial interest the&#xD;
emotions of her father, who, mounted upon a&#xD;
fine horse, had joined the sergeant, with such&#xD;
of his slaves as he believed would be of use,&#xD;
when she was unexpectedly seized by rough&#xD;
hands, and with Dame Grindle and Meg, hur-&#xD;
ried to a distance from the house. When the&#xD;
dragoons began to fall back upon the wood,&#xD;
-and the scale of battle seemed no longer doubt-&#xD;
ful, Dame Grindle was released, with many&#xD;
jests and much merriment at her expense ;&#xD;
for she had acquired such a habit of talking,&#xD;
that nothing under heaven but a complete ex-&#xD;
tinction of her being could stop her, when&#xD;
fully launched upon the sounding sea of lo-&#xD;
quacity. Judith and Meg remained with their&#xD;
captors ; and presently the former saw, with&#xD;
inexpressible sorrow, the flames curling from&#xD;
the roof of the paternal ngansion. She thought&#xD;
of her sister and Somerton, and begged the&#xD;
ruffians around her to go to their rescue, who&#xD;
heard her appeals with the utmost insensibil-&#xD;
ity. While she was making these useless en-&#xD;
treaties, a man in the uniform of a British of-&#xD;
fieer approached. It was Christian Hadley,&#xD;
that to'y-leader, whose name was at that time&#xD;
held i} universal dread and execration by the&#xD;
friends of freedom.&#xD;
Judith knew him.; they had met before, and&#xD;
parted with anger on his side, disgust and ab-&#xD;
horrence on hers. He had paid suit to her in&#xD;
his rough fashion, before he had become so&#xD;
stained with crime and blackened with vil-&#xD;
lainy. More than once in the past had he&#xD;
placed himself in her path, and added terror&#xD;
to repugnance. Of late, they had not met,&#xD;
for he had been busy in making himself infa-&#xD;
mous to all posterity ; while she had seldom&#xD;
ventured from the paternal roof. As the war&#xD;
rolled nearer, and finally encircled them, her&#xD;
fears of Christian Hadley had grown stronger,&#xD;
and secretly she had long expected a visit&#xD;
from him at the head of his marauders. The&#xD;
moment of vengeance and triumph had ar-&#xD;
rived. The grim partisan stood before her,&#xD;
not to sue but to command.&#xD;
Judith saw exultation in his eyes, and knew&#xD;
too much of his character to attempt to move&#xD;

him. She fixed her regards upon the burn-&#xD;
ing house, and affected not to notice him, al-&#xD;
though she was trembling at his presence.&#xD;
" Well, Miss Juditi, what do you think of&#xD;
this?" he asked, with a sneer. She gave him&#xD;
a haughty, indignant glance--a mute answer&#xD;
that annoyed him more than words.&#xD;
" You see the fate of rebellion and rebels,"&#xD;
he added. "I told you long ago that it would&#xD;
come to- this, but you spurned the prophecy.&#xD;
If you'd ,taken my advice, you wouldn't be-&#xD;
hold to-siight your home in flames, and your&#xD;
household-scattered."&#xD;
"Infamous !" murmured Judith.    -&#xD;
"Infamous ! 'tis mighty well, Miss Red-&#xD;
mond ! Your pride and scorn become you ;&#xD;
but both will be humbled.P&#xD;
" Whatever rigor or cruelty you may offer,&#xD;
I beg of you not to speak, but to spare me&#xD;
the sound of a voice that is hateful to me.&#xD;
To see you and to- hear you, are two misfor-&#xD;
tunes from which I pray Heaven to deliver&#xD;
me."&#xD;
" I am a British officer, Judith Redmond,&#xD;
and have the king's commission in my pock-&#xD;
et," returned Hadley, pompously.&#xD;
"Say, rather, that you are a traitor, a rene-&#xD;
gade, a marauder, a swamp-robber-anything&#xD;
but a true and honest man!" cried Judith,&#xD;
with a warmth of indignation that proved how&#xD;
deeply she felt the truthfulness of what she&#xD;
uttered.&#xD;
" Traitor, renegade, marauder, robber !"&#xD;
repeated Hadley, with a frowning brow.&#xD;
"The terms are too mild ; they fall in-&#xD;
finitely below my meaning," added Judith.&#xD;
" If I am such-a monster, you have reason&#xD;
to expect but little mercy from me," said&#xD;
Hadley, with a menacing look.&#xD;
" I anticipate from you all that is unmanly,&#xD;
dishonorable, and evil, if God does not deliver&#xD;
me from your hands."&#xD;
" You shall not be disappointed in your&#xD;
anticipations. I swear it!" replied the cap-&#xD;
tain, his face reddening with anger.&#xD;
" I have not tried to excite your compas-&#xD;
sion, for I know how vain and hopeless would&#xD;
beo the attempt. I put my trust in One strong-&#xD;
er than thou. To Him will I make my prayer&#xD;
and not to thee," answered Judith, impressive-&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
" I will not keep you long in suspense.&#xD;
Men, put her upon a horse. Two of you&#xD;
mount and attend me."&#xD;
Miss Redmond, seeing the futility of resist-&#xD;
ance, allowed herself to be placed passively&#xD;
upon horseback. She was then escorted from&#xD;
the scene of the late events by the captain&#xD;
and two of his fellows-a proceeding much&#xD;
against her wishes. Meg was taken up behind&#xD;
one of the men. - Fear had thus far kept her&#xD;
silent ; but now, finding her tongue, she began&#xD;
to bewail her fate bitterly.&#xD;

" We's jes' the same as dead, missus ; el'ar&#xD;

face upon her mistress, who made a feeble at&#xD;
tempt to console her.&#xD;

live so many years, if they'd on'y let us be!'&#xD;
The tory behind whom she was seated, per-&#xD;
ceiving her state of mind, took pleasure in&#xD;
increasing her terrors during the remainder of&#xD;
the nocturnal ride, by various appalling threats&#xD;
and ingenious artifices. This journey lasted&#xD;
about an hour, and wound eccentrically&#xD;
through the Pine Woods by a narrow path,&#xD;
at the expiration of which time they arrived&#xD;
at a log-cabin, through the crerices of- which&#xD;
the glimmer of a fire could be seen. Hadley&#xD;
threw himself from his horse, and knocked&#xD;
loudly with the hilt of his sword ; which sum-&#xD;
mons wasinstantly answered by IL woman's&#xD;
voice within.&#xD;
"Who are ye, and what do ye want ?  This&#xD;
is a fine hour to come disturbin' a lone wo-&#xD;
man, who is neutral to both parties and hasn't&#xD;
nobody to protect her, them as should be her&#xD;
defenders bein' out o' the country, and gone&#xD;
the Lord only knows where, for I don't, though&#xD;
it's caused me oceans o' trouble and worri-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
How much longer the woman would have&#xD;
gone on, is pr blematical; for both lungs and&#xD;
tongue seemed'in excellent order for running&#xD;
a long time. Hadley interrupted her with :&#xD;
" Come, come, old lady ! Hold up and be-&#xD;
lay ; you're wasting a good deal o' breath, for&#xD;
it is I that knock."&#xD;
"Is it my son Christian ?" she demanded ;&#xD;
and instantly there followed a rattling of bolts&#xD;
and bars, and the door was opened.&#xD;
Judith had felt somewhat encouraged when&#xD;
she heard a female voice ; but when its pos-&#xD;
sessor stood before her, her hope in one, of her&#xD;
own sex receivegl a shock. Mrs. Hadley was&#xD;
not a model of feminine beauty, -being of a&#xD;
large and masculine frame, with an abundance&#xD;
of bone and muscle,- prominent cheeks, a large&#xD;
nose, gray eyes, eyebrows, and hair, and a&#xD;
mouth of unusual calibre, rendered less at-&#xD;
tractive by the lobs of most of her teeth. The&#xD;
united expression of the various features of&#xD;
her face was coarse, -shrewish, and deter-&#xD;

s   " What have I brought, mother Hadley?&#xD;

with filial familiarity.&#xD;
' "Which one is it ?" quoth Mrs. Hadley,&#xD;

Judith than at Meg. " Is it the yaller or the&#xD;
white ?"&#xD;
" This hop-o'-my-thumb little woman is the&#xD;

" Hoity-toity !" exclaimed Mother Hadley,&#xD;
placing her aims akimbo, and looking sharply&#xD;
I at her prospective daughter-in-law. " Hate&#xD;
my son Christian? How dare a gal hate my&#xD;
son Christian ? How smart he looks in his&#xD;
new regimentals ! A reg'lar officer, too, in&#xD;

Judith, who had'dismounted, was now cob-&#xD;
ducted into the cabin, tremblin 'with fear.&#xD;
"You are a woman," she E id. addressing&#xD;
Mrs. Hadley, " and I throw myself upon your&#xD;
protection. Shield me from hese wretches,&#xD;
and heaven will' reward you for your kind-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
" Wretches? That's what I call a sharp&#xD;

'tisn't one o' Squire Redmond's darters ; and&#xD;
the' Redmonds are the rankest rebels in the&#xD;
country. Now, no son o' mine shall marry a&#xD;

"It's no use talkin', mother ; I took a shine1&#xD;
to lher long ago, and my mind hasn't been set-'&#xD;
tIed and happy since. I know that she scorns&#xD;
me, but I can't help it ; the more she disdains&#xD;

Hadley hastened to give him. He drank a five feet and an inch in her high-heeled shoes !&#xD;
frightful quantity, casting the vessel upon the Away, lad, away, and let your two boys toddle&#xD;
floor when he had drained it.            arter ye."&#xD;
&#xD;
.&#xD;
{'&#xD;
3&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, mother," said the partisan, and&#xD;
looked wishfully at Judith, who was bearing&#xD;
this scene with what philosophy she could.&#xD;
Possibly he felt a faint hope that she would&#xD;
say something encouraging. If he did, he&#xD;
was disappointed ; for she remained silent&#xD;
and unobservant of him. His face was first&#xD;
mournful, then angry ; he stalked from the&#xD;
house with an oath, followed by his two at-&#xD;
tendants. Judith heard them mount their&#xD;
horses and gallop away. She was glad ; the&#xD;
sound of their departing steps gave her inex-&#xD;
pressible relief. She was left with one of her&#xD;
own sex, and to her ingenuous and hopeful&#xD;
disposition, it seemed impossible that she&#xD;
could not melt Mother Hadley's harshness.&#xD;
Time was worth too much to waste, and she&#xD;
assailed the woman's better nature at once&#xD;
with every moving argument that she could&#xD;
think of; but she was made of sterner'stuff&#xD;
than she had imagined, and her eloquent ap-&#xD;
peals fell fruitless on the flinty substance of&#xD;
her heart. She grew irate, at length, and&#xD;
showing her a couch, peremptorily ordered&#xD;
her to bed and to sleep.&#xD;
- The log cabin was a common affair in those&#xD;
days, and made a very comfortable home for&#xD;
the early settlers. Mother Hadley's was di-&#xD;
vided into two compartments ; one for sleep,&#xD;
the other for all the ordinary purposes of life.&#xD;
" Go in, gal-go in I" said Captain Deb, de-&#xD;
cisively, pointing to the door of the first-men-&#xD;
tioned room. " Go in, and #ream of bein' a&#xD;
lady and the wife of my son, Christian, with&#xD;
his royal red, and his long sword, with plan-&#xD;
tations and slaves, and the confidence of the&#xD;
king."&#xD;
There was no help for Judith. The wo-&#xD;
man's strength and determination overcame&#xD;
her weakness and weariness. She and Meg&#xD;
were pushed into the narrow room. It had&#xD;
not even a window to admit the light of the&#xD;
sun, or of the moon and stars. Tle slender&#xD;
tallow candle which Mrs. Hadley left them&#xD;
burned dimly, making dark and fluctuating&#xD;
shadows on the walls.&#xD;
Meg and Judith seated themselves upon&#xD;
the bed, and looked at each other inquiringly&#xD;
"We's done gone lost," said the former en&#xD;
couragingly. "The Continental boys is whip-&#xD;
ped,\the red-coats hab got de whole world, de&#xD;
plantation is burned up, Mas'r Redmon' i&#xD;
gone de Lor' on'y knows where, Missy Mirian&#xD;
and de colonel am cl'av perished, and de Lib&#xD;
erty am jes' nowhere 1"&#xD;
Judith did not answer the lanentations o&#xD;
Meg, 'simply because she knew not what t&#xD;
say. She allowed her to go ofl, and gathe&#xD;
all their griefs into one mournful heap.&#xD;
" Whar's de use talkin' 'bout freedom&#xD;
We's got too much of it, I s'pect ; got d&#xD;
freedom to wander all over de world 'thou&#xD;
house an' home, or plantation, or niggers&#xD;
&#xD;
freedom to hide in de'woods, and to skulk&#xD;
'bout like no 'count runaways. Don't want&#xD;
nebber to hear no more 'bout the sentimental&#xD;
congress, Mas'r Washin'ton, and de spread&#xD;
eagle. Lor! Miss Jjidith, jes' give me a good&#xD;
house to live in, an' plenty to eat and drink,&#xD;
an' a squantity o' good clothes to wear, and I&#xD;
doesn't keer for all de liberty ye could crowd&#xD;
into Carliny."&#xD;
Meg rocked herself to and fro on the bed,&#xD;
and grieved over the fallen fortunes of the&#xD;
Redmonds.&#xD;
" Where's de hominy and de cornnkea?&#xD;
where's de bacon and de egg? where's dd&#xD;
singin' and de fiddlin' at night on de old&#xD;
plantation? Who'll take keer o' de corn, do&#xD;
cotton, de sugar-cane, and grow de indigo?&#xD;
Dear ! dear ! de world's jes' come to an end,&#xD;
an' we's poor critters, de best on us. Dey&#xD;
say King George heself is comit' 'cross de&#xD;
water to settle in de Carliny State. Golly,&#xD;
missus ! Won't he cut up de libertymen !&#xD;
He rides in his carriage an' four, the king&#xD;
does, with a crown o' gold on his head, and a&#xD;
power o' money. Better gib up, missus, an&#xD;
turn tory wid de rest of 'em. I'm done gone&#xD;
an' made up my mind to be a Britisher."&#xD;
The door was heard to open in the other&#xD;
part of the cabin.&#xD;
" Be quiet,"said Judith. Both put their&#xD;
eyes to a crevice to see who came, and both&#xD;
were shocked at the sight of Jaffer, the run-&#xD;
away, on the threshold. Captain Deb con-&#xD;
fronted him with her oaken staff, erect and&#xD;
stern. Clearly, his looks did not please her.&#xD;
He was laboring under strong excitement, un-&#xD;
armed, apparently, but sufficiently terrible&#xD;
in his half-nakedness.&#xD;
The two looked at each other a moment in&#xD;
silence, as if each were trying to. discover the&#xD;
1 vulnerable points of the other.&#xD;
" What sent ye'?" demanded Captain' Deb.&#xD;
" And why do ye open doors and come in&#xD;
'thout knockin', like a prowling' thief of the&#xD;
night?"&#xD;
Jaffer cast a sullen, half-menacing glance&#xD;
at Mother Hadley, shut the door, and slipped&#xD;
the large wooden bolt into its place. His&#xD;
person was now fully revealed, and formed as&#xD;
- unpleasant a picture as the, eye could well&#xD;
e rest upon. There were wounds and scratches&#xD;
s on his hands, arnms, and face, which added&#xD;
n much to the grimness of his aspect. Mrs.&#xD;
- Hadley maintained her ground, but held her&#xD;
staff more firmly.&#xD;
f " Are you a dumb devil.?" she added, sharp-&#xD;
o ly. " Has your thick tongue forgotten hu--&#xD;
r man speech ?"&#xD;
"She's here ; Cap'n Chris brought her."&#xD;
?   He looked eagerly aboutthe room.&#xD;
e   "Who's here, thick-head !" asked the wo-&#xD;
it man, fearlessly.&#xD;
;   "The gal - Mas'r Redmon's gal-Judy!&#xD;

THE SWORDMAKER OF THE SANTEE:&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, HIRL THE HUNCHBACK.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Tother one's burnt up," replied*the negro, in&#xD;
a muttering, jerking voice.&#xD;
" There's no' Judy' here ; not for you, least-&#xD;
wise. So if that's the arrand you come on,&#xD;
you can turn and go back, and say Deb Had-&#xD;
ley sent ye."&#xD;
" Seed the cap'n take her from de planta-&#xD;
tion. -Black Jaffer follered-tracked him like&#xD;
a dog--run like a wolf with his nose to de&#xD;
groun'. Cap'n stop here--leave Judy-go&#xD;
way."&#xD;
Jaffer glowered ferociously at Mrs. Hadley.&#xD;
" What have you to do with my son Chris-&#xD;
tian, with his sword, and his shoulder-knots,&#xD;
.and his royal red? What have you to do&#xD;
-with white natur, any way, white female natur&#xD;
in partie'lar ? Out o' my cabin ! out into the&#xD;
night, which is your own brother, and'into the&#xD;
.swamp, which is your habitation.''&#xD;
"Th er ! in yer !" growled Jaffer, pointing&#xD;
to the door, the other side of which stood Ju-&#xD;
dith and Meg, trembling with apprehension.&#xD;
Mrs. Hadley promptly placed herself be-&#xD;
tween the black and the point indicated by&#xD;
his sooty finger.&#xD;
" She's fbr my son Christian, and you'll&#xD;
pass over my body to git her. I know your&#xD;
malice, that you hate the Redmonds, and have&#xD;
.sworn vengeance on the whole family; but&#xD;
you'll do no murderin' and devil's-work here.&#xD;
I'm Deb Hadley, and if you harm me, my son&#xD;
Christian will hang ye higher than the seven&#xD;
stars."&#xD;
Imagine the sensations of Judith and Meg !&#xD;
This danger crowned all the terrors of the,&#xD;
night. They trusted in the prowess of the&#xD;
brave woman, who was manifestly disposed to&#xD;
resist the ruffian to the last.&#xD;
The black stared at his antagonist a full&#xD;
minute without moving a muscle of his great&#xD;
body ; then chuckled, and looked inquisitively&#xD;
around the room, as if in search of something.&#xD;
His eyes stopped on a stout piece of rope&#xD;
trailing from a peg near the door. Nearly&#xD;
.over his head where he was standing, was a&#xD;
strong iron hook, with a leg of venison sus-&#xD;
pended' upon it, which he detached and flung&#xD;
upon the floor. Seizing the rope, he made&#xD;
one end fast to the hook, and formed a run-&#xD;
ning noose of the other., His expression dur-;&#xD;
ing this time was indescribably sinister, and&#xD;
his sidelong glances at the woman were full of&#xD;
evil.&#xD;
"What now, Satan ?"&#xD;
"He, heI ho, ho ! hangin' is the thing.I&#xD;
Glad ye mentioned dis ver !"&#xD;
"You're drunk, beast:!" retorted Mrs. Had-I&#xD;
-ley, who felt uneasy, but was careful not toi&#xD;
exhibit signs of shrinking.E&#xD;
-" You's seen rebels hung, ole woman; good&#xD;
for dem-good for you, too. He, he ! Jafferi&#xD;
'hang Cap'n Deb, an' live here hisself !"&#xD;
&#xD;
His nostrils dilated, and his eyes rolled in&#xD;
his head with frightful glee.&#xD;
"You're a fool !" said Mrs. Hadley. "You&#xD;
can't hang a person there; the rope is too&#xD;
long. Put a woman of my size in that noose,&#xD;
and her feet would touch the floor."&#xD;
" Come along," growled Jaffer, ." or I'll&#xD;
throw ye on the fire and burn ye ! tie easy&#xD;
this yer way ; hard t'other."&#xD;
This, to him, novel way of hanging Mother&#xD;
Hadley having once entered 'his head, grew&#xD;
every moment stronger. No power could&#xD;
have persuaded him to abandon his purpose.&#xD;
He felt a phrenzied delight in the perspective&#xD;
struggles of the woman who presumed to op-&#xD;
pose his despotic will. That he could carry&#xD;
out his diabolical design without a sharp con-&#xD;
test, did not appear possible ; but that was an&#xD;
item that the black had evidently felt no anxi-&#xD;
ty about. He trusted to his great physical&#xD;
strength, and the terror he could inspire by&#xD;
menaces.&#xD;
Daipe Hadley had been quietly studying&#xD;
the human animal, and laying plans in agree-&#xD;
ment with her conclusions. She saw his mus-&#xD;
cles quivering with strength and impatience,&#xD;
and knew that the crisis could not be long de-&#xD;
layed. She thought of her son, Christian,&#xD;
and listened anxiously to hear the- tramp of&#xD;
his horse. To attempt to reason with the&#xD;
being before her, she knew u as out of the&#xD;
question.&#xD;
" You may strangle me, Jaffer; yet, I won't&#xD;
give up the gal that my son, Christian, told mc&#xD;
to keep. But I never was hanged in my life,&#xD;
and I don't know how to be no more 'n a child.&#xD;
I've give you shelter many a time, and food&#xD;
to eat when you's well-nigh famished ;' and I&#xD;
hope you won't be cruel, with an old body&#xD;
that never harmed ye. There's a drop o'&#xD;
good liquor in that keg there ; take a sip on't,&#xD;
and maybe it'll warm and soften your heart."&#xD;
Jaffer caught the vessel, drained "it, and&#xD;
hurled it through .the only window the cabin&#xD;
possessed.&#xD;
"Now for it, ole woman !" he shouted, put-&#xD;
ting on all the ferocity of his repulsive fea-&#xD;
tures.&#xD;
"Not a bit on't, till you shorten the rope,&#xD;
and tell me how it's done. If I've got to go,&#xD;
I don't want to make a botch on't."&#xD;
Jaffer wound a portion of the rope around&#xD;
the hook, and pushed a chair under it.&#xD;
" This way, you witch ! this way ! He, he !&#xD;
ho, ho !"&#xD;
He stepped into the chair, thrust his curly&#xD;
head through the noose, and glared with fiend-&#xD;
ish exultation at Mother Hadley. The chair&#xD;
sank from under him; there was a creak and&#xD;
a crash, and Jaffer hung suspended by the&#xD;
neck.&#xD;
Mrs. Hadley had touched a secret spring,&#xD;
&#xD;
and a trap-door had fallen downward into a&#xD;
cellar beneath the cabin. le was heavy, and&#xD;
a sudden descent of three feet gave him a ter-&#xD;
rific shock, confused his faculties, and drew&#xD;
the cord chokingly tight. He quivered an in-&#xD;
stant, clutched at the rope, and tried to gather&#xD;
his limbs up to obtain a. footing upon the&#xD;
floor; but, as often as he touched it, Captain&#xD;
Deb pushed him back with her staff. He&#xD;
lifted his body with his hands, and begged&#xD;
piteously for relief.&#xD;
"0 Lord, misses! 0 Lord! I's only fun-&#xD;
nin'! Le' mai down-le' me down, an' I'll&#xD;
go right away, an' neber, neber come back!&#xD;
) good Cap'n Deb ! 0 good Cap'n Deb!"&#xD;
In -answer to this appeal, Mrs. Hadley be-&#xD;
stowed such hearty thwacks upon his fingers&#xD;
that they relaxed their hold, and his arms fell&#xD;
convulsed at his side.&#xD;
"'Funnin', was ye ? you black Satan! Well,&#xD;
I'm .funnin' now. How do ye like it, ch ?&#xD;
Hanging' is fine sport, isn't it?"&#xD;
Jatfer roared, begged, and struggled. His&#xD;
gigantic frame writhed and quivered 'fright-&#xD;
fully.&#xD;
J adth and Meg beheld the shocking spec-&#xD;
tacle with awe and astonish ent. When, in&#xD;
the agony of suffocation, h made attempts&#xD;
to grasp the rope, the remorseless staff of Deb&#xD;
Hadley beat down his arms.&#xD;
Judith could scarcely command her emo-&#xD;
tions, and turned from the sight dizzy and&#xD;
faint. The gasping respiration of the black&#xD;
finally ceased ; his breast' no longer heaved ;&#xD;
his limbs subsided into quietness, and he hung,&#xD;
without motion, a dark and revolting object.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
IN WmICII A MARRIAGE CEREMONY IS PERFoRMED.&#xD;
" The race is not to the swift nor the battle&#xD;
to the strong," moraligd Deborah Hadley, as&#xD;
she surveyed the gigantic form of Jaffer.&#xD;
" The brute had strength, but not the cunnin'&#xD;
to match a woman. He was an idle, vicious.&#xD;
prowlin' cur, as likely to shed royal as rebel&#xD;
blood. Well, I've saved the hangman trouble&#xD;
and done the country a sarvice. Heart alive !&#xD;
how I tremble ! I haven't been so nigh my&#xD;
cend in a long time. But I didn't give her&#xD;
up ; no, I kept her for my son Christian.&#xD;
'Twas white natur ag'in black natur, and the&#xD;
white has carried the day. Well," she con-&#xD;
tinued, looking at the remains of Jaffer, " the&#xD;
creetur 'pears to be quite done for. The fool !&#xD;
to try his wit ag'in Deb Hadley."&#xD;
The clatter of iron-shod feet was heard.&#xD;
" It's my son Christian !" said the old wo-&#xD;
man. "If he has ridden far, he has ridden&#xD;
fast. This won't be a pooty sight for him on&#xD;
his weddin'-night, so I'll put it out o' the way."&#xD;
She cut the rope with a knife, and the body&#xD;
of Jaffn r fell heavily into the cellar.- She drew&#xD;
up the door and fastened it. Why the trapI&#xD;
&#xD;
was constructed in that peculiar manner, with&#xD;
a stout hook over it, can only be guessed at.&#xD;
If some of the dark - secrets of that period&#xD;
could be told, conjecture would doubtless yield&#xD;
to certainty, and the uses of that contrivance&#xD;
would cease to be a mystery.&#xD;
By the time Mrs. l1adley had concealed all&#xD;
evidence of her work, her son entered the&#xD;
cabin, followed by a man dressed in a suit of&#xD;
shabby black, which appeared much too small&#xD;
to fit his person, wluch was, rather tall and&#xD;
athletic. His hat was in keeping with the&#xD;
rest of his externals, showing 'signs of recent&#xD;
brushing and smoothing. The frayed edges&#xD;
of the brim seemed to have been polished&#xD;
with blacking, to keep up its sombre respect-&#xD;
ability. His neck-cloth was of white cotton,&#xD;
and of remarkable width. His hair was long,&#xD;
straight, nearly of flax color, and soberly put&#xD;
away behind his ears. His whiskers, which&#xD;
were rather sparse, were of the same hue, and&#xD;
were noticeable because not generally worn&#xD;
by clergymen at that time. His face was pale&#xD;
and lugubriously solemn. Clearly, the man&#xD;
thought the universal world was going to&#xD;
wreck and ruin as fast as was conveniently&#xD;
possible.&#xD;
He carried a prayer-book in his hand, and&#xD;
appeared ready for any emergency in the&#xD;
legitimate way (f his profession. His gaze&#xD;
wandered somewhat hurriedly around the&#xD;
room, as soon as he found himself within it,&#xD;
finally resting, with mild dignity, on Deborah&#xD;
Hadley.&#xD;
" Well, mother ?" said Christian.&#xD;
" All safe an' snug, my soger-boy."&#xD;
"Nothing has happened '" queried the cap-&#xD;
tain, with hesitation.&#xD;
" Much has happened, but the gal is thdre.&#xD;
I'm sorry you haven't set your mind on a&#xD;
willin' bride ; but what is, must needs be, and&#xD;
what has happened, we must abide by," quoth&#xD;
Mrs. Hadley.&#xD;
" Verily, I am glad, sistEr Iladley, that thy&#xD;
mind is so seasoned with grace," said the par-&#xD;
son, "for resignation is one of the principal&#xD;
virtues of a Christian. Sure-ly it is refresh-&#xD;
ing to meet with one, in these degenerate&#xD;
times, in whom the word is not the savior of&#xD;
death into death, but of life unto life. I trust,&#xD;
Mrs. Hadley-"&#xD;
",My name is Deb Hadley, often an' 'toth-&#xD;
erwise called Cap'n Deb ; and wry faces, and&#xD;
highfalutin isn't the kind o' comfort that I&#xD;
need."&#xD;
. "Still, madam, I may entertain a hope that&#xD;
the seed, in your case, has fallen on good&#xD;
soil. and brought forth the peaceable fruits of&#xD;
righteousness," lie continued, in an edifying&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
"As for fruit," said Debqrah Hadley,&#xD;
" there's but little on't that's worth eatin' in&#xD;

one year, but they wasn't of no 'count. I'm abyss, and saw the body of Jaffer lying in a&#xD;
a plain, matter-of-fact body, and flambergast- heap, as it had fallen. Both shivered.&#xD;
ed speeches don't greatly affect me. What's  " Mother I you are a  iness !" said Christi-&#xD;

eCHAPTER XXII.                  Judith's face was the picture of indescrib-&#xD;
ALL     FOR    LOVE.             able dismay.&#xD;
In coming back to this hard, conscious world "I s'pect they's done you a drefful wrong !"&#xD;
of facts and realities, Judith Redmond expect- replied Meg, crying piteously for the sorrows&#xD;
ed to see the solemn face of the parson and of her young mistress. "The man with de&#xD;

The old woman was chafing her hands, and faintly.&#xD;
making various friendly attempts to restore  " I tole 'em so !-I tole 'em so! But they&#xD;

temper.                                     " Darter-in-law," said Mrs. Hadley, quietly,&#xD;
" Mrs. Cap'n Hadley, the legal wife of my " don't let your w,  al irs.  y,  u-&#xD;

Judith gently pushed away the woman ;     This threat had a restraining influence upon&#xD;
and, by the aid of Meg, sat up and looked Meg, who could imagine nothing more tern-&#xD;
slowly and vaguely about her. Mrs. Hadley ble than the incarceration referred to.&#xD;
suddenly sprang at her, kissed her forehead,  "Wan," sarcerath, r    r ko&#xD;

swered Meg, coming at once to the point.   Judith clasped her hands in despair.&#xD;
"Mrs. Hadley," quoth Deb, with extraor-   "Hist!" said Mother Deb, holding up an&#xD;
dinary politeness, "what'll you choose to admonishing hand. "Some one comes this&#xD;

The rebels is whipped, and the liberty they "Hide me, good woman, hide m !" lie ecx-&#xD;
talked about is gone to the dogs. Cheer up, claimed, hurriedly. "I am pursued by the&#xD;
de"ry, cheer up !"                       rebel dragoons. My strength is spent, and&#xD;

true Y"                                 j deceive them."&#xD;
&#xD;
77&#xD;
&#xD;
Nerved with sudden strength, Judith arose,&#xD;
and made a step toward the fugitive.&#xD;
"I hear the tramp of horses. Fly, wretched&#xD;
man, fly !" she cried.&#xD;
"Fly !" he repeated, turning to her with a&#xD;
bitter smile. " As well might an eagle skim&#xD;
the air with a broken wing ! I am'hunted&#xD;
down, have reached this cox cr, and can go no&#xD;
farther."&#xD;
Deering rested against the wall for support.&#xD;
" They come ! they come !" said Judith&#xD;
and, springing to the door, pushed the stout&#xD;
bolt to its place.&#xD;
" Well done, darter-in-law! 'tis a brave be-&#xD;
ginnin' !" said Mrs. Hadley, approvingly.&#xD;
Judith glanced at Deering, to see if his&#xD;
count nance changed ; but lie did not appear&#xD;
to heed the woman's remark.&#xD;
"Will you hide me !" cried Deering ; " or&#xD;
will you see me murdered ?"&#xD;
e1Ye-, yes ! we will hide you," replied Ju-&#xD;
dith. " Good woman," she added, " for Heav-&#xD;
en's sake, conceal him !"&#xD;
"If you mean it, gal, it can be done ; but&#xD;
-       it will depend on you, and I a'n't sartin that&#xD;
I can trust ye. Them that are coming' are&#xD;
your friends, and how do I know but you'll&#xD;
.tell ,I for the sake o' your own liberty, and&#xD;
'ctraY this poor Id to death."&#xD;
Judith was in a painful dilemma, but quick-&#xD;
ly decided, between herself and her lover,&#xD;
whose earnest eyes were upon her.&#xD;
"If it rests with me, I swear to you that I&#xD;
will save him !" she solemnly answered.&#xD;
"Will you'trust her, lad ?" demanded Deb.&#xD;
"With my life-with my salvation !" he&#xD;
exclaimed.&#xD;
The spurs of the dragoons were heard rat-&#xD;
tling upon the ground as they dismonted,&#xD;
mingled with the clanking of their heavy&#xD;
sabres.'&#xD;
"rFollow!" said Mrs. Hadley, seizing the'&#xD;
candle, and striding into the sleeping-room.&#xD;
Approaching the bed, she stripped it in an&#xD;
instant to its straw-mattress.&#xD;
"Jump into the middle, lad, and lay down&#xD;
as close as if you's ready for the undertaker."&#xD;
"I obey !" said Deering, stretching himself&#xD;
upon the'mattress.           I&#xD;
"Play dead well, or dead you'll be," said&#xD;
the woman, tossing the feather-bed upon hin&#xD;
as if it were light as air. Smoothing it down,&#xD;
she laid the pillows and spread the coverings&#xD;
t    deftly.  The last hurried touch given,- she&#xD;
threw back the sheets, and snatching  a white&#xD;
cap from a nail, thrust it toward Judith, as if&#xD;
her arm was a spear to transfix her.&#xD;
The girl's face grew deadly pale.&#xD;
"Put it on !" hissed Deb, with terrible&#xD;
energy.&#xD;
While Judith stood hesitating and mute,&#xD;
there was a thunderous knocking at the door.&#xD;
" It's life and death," muttered Deb ; and,I&#xD;
&#xD;
-'    !-',   --~,-&#xD;
&#xD;
76&#xD;
&#xD;
t-&#xD;
P&#xD;
&#xD;
seizing the cap from Judith's paralyzed hand,&#xD;
drew it over her dark curls, knotted it under&#xD;
her chin,*then lifting her in her determined&#xD;
and masculine arms, placed her upon the&#xD;
bed, and drew the coverings over her. She&#xD;
next caught Meg with no dainty grasp, and&#xD;
seated her on the bed beside her mistress.&#xD;
" Open ! open !" shouted the voice of Ser-&#xD;
geant Giles. " Open, old hag, or I'll beat&#xD;
your nest down about your ears.&#xD;
" Gal," said Mrs. Hadley,-sternly, looking&#xD;
at Judith, " if you've got narves, show 'em.&#xD;
If you play the fool and the coward, he is&#xD;
lost. Meg! sit still, and do as your mistress&#xD;
tells ye. If questioned, let her answer ; and&#xD;
what she says, say you."&#xD;
" Down with the door-down with it !&#xD;
roared Giles, whose stock of patience was now&#xD;
entirely exhausted.&#xD;
"Comin'! coming! " cried Deb, at the top&#xD;
of her voice.&#xD;
"Comin'! coming! " mimicked Giles. "Hur-&#xD;
ry up, then, old magpie !" Mrs. Hadley de-&#xD;
liberately opened the door, and, standing di-&#xD;
rectly in it, demanded the, cause of the dis-&#xD;
turbance.&#xD;
" Stand aside, and you shall know our er-&#xD;
rand soon enough," answered Giles. The&#xD;
latter and Humphrey immediately drew their&#xD;
swords, and pushed into the cabin.&#xD;
. "Keep a good watch outside there, Tom&#xD;
Thornton," said the sergeant. " If he tries&#xD;
to escape through the window, cut him down&#xD;
with your sabre ; if from the roof, shoot him&#xD;
with your musket."&#xD;
"Stop, my rough soger-lad, and tell me&#xD;
why you rush, into a lone woman's cabin in&#xD;
this blusterin' fashion?" said Captain Deb,&#xD;
nothing daunted.&#xD;
" A white glove," quoth the sergeant,&#xD;
" often conceals a dirty hand, and a danure&#xD;
face sometimes conceals a deal of wickedness.&#xD;
Our time is short, and we can't waste it in&#xD;
idle tulk with a witch-wife like you. We have&#xD;
reason to think that you have given shelter&#xD;
and concealment to one of the most danger-&#xD;
ous men on the Santee."&#xD;
Giles looked at Mother, Hadley, as if his&#xD;
eyes were corkscrews to draw out secrets with.&#xD;
She met his gaze with the utmost steadiness.&#xD;
" Who might he be?' she inquired.&#xD;
"The person we seek," said the chaplain,&#xD;
" is probably no stranirer to you. Do not&#xD;
keep us, waiting, but deliver him up at once,&#xD;
that he may suffer even the -fate of Haman."&#xD;
".Of whom do ye speak ?" demanded Deb.&#xD;
"Woman of Belial, do not practice vain&#xD;
and unavailing evasions ; for I do assure you&#xD;
that we shall search every part of your dwell-&#xD;
ing so thoroughly that not so much as a mouse ,&#xD;
in the wall shall escape our eyes," returned&#xD;
Humphrey.&#xD;

" Anything to obleege ye, my scurvy little mission, Humphrey was the first to come up ;&#xD;
sergeant," said Mrs. De , with remarkable and he cast behind him glances of awe and&#xD;
sang froid, at the same time springing the trap, perplexity. Nor was the doughty Giles much&#xD;
&#xD;
less affected by the grizzly spectacle ; he was&#xD;
visibly glad to see the trap closed.'&#xD;
" It would appear," said the chaplain, " ifi&#xD;
human eyes are to be trusted, that a fellow-&#xD;
creature has here met his death."&#xD;
"Fellow-creature !" repeated Giles, with at&#xD;
strong expression of contempt. " You don'tI&#xD;
call that black ape a fellow-creature, do ye ?i&#xD;
He forms, as 'twere, but the connecting link&#xD;
-atween monkeys and men. There's been no&#xD;
great mischief done, for the feller's desarved&#xD;
hangin' a dozen times. If I'mistake not, it's&#xD;
the body of a desperate runaway from Red-1&#xD;
mond's plantation, and a great villain he's&#xD;
been. Vow, parson, we'll search my lady's&#xD;
bower."&#xD;
"You'll find as good a lady there as any in&#xD;
the land !" retorted Mrs. Hadley. " And she'd&#xD;
been in her innocent dreams afore this, if you&#xD;
hadn't disturbed her by your thumpin', and&#xD;
clatterin', and ill-manners giner'ly."&#xD;
" Chaplain, look well to yourself when a&#xD;
woman blusters. Open the door, Mistress&#xD;
Deb ; I must c'en peep into this sanctuary of&#xD;
beauty."&#xD;
"a Spare your jokes, sergeant, for you'll&#xD;
need allyour small shot when the Royal Amer-&#xD;
icans start ye from your cover. The time was&#xD;
when Deb Iladiley was as comely a gal as you'll&#xD;
find in a whole colony of sieh. Beauty is but&#xD;
skin deep, but wit reaches to the brain. 'Tisn't&#xD;
for sick as you, sergeant, to be runnin' your&#xD;
nose into the sleepin' rooms of young women&#xD;
daintily brouht up."'&#xD;
" Fling down the nests, and the rooks will&#xD;
'be gone; so stan' aside, mistress, or oblige us&#xD;
by givin' that door a fling, that we may have&#xD;
a stare at that same innocence you have spo-&#xD;
enf"&#xD;
"1If ye must be rude, open the door your-&#xD;
self; but I warn ye, if you insult the young&#xD;
woman, you'll have to account for it to more&#xD;
nor one."&#xD;
The sergeant, having no great confidence in&#xD;
Deb's veracity, and little reverence for beauty,&#xD;
did not pause to pull the latch-string, but&#xD;
burst open the door with a stroke of his foot.&#xD;
His first emotions on entering must have been&#xD;
pretty-lecided, for he stopped short and stood&#xD;
as motionless as one of the old-fashioned bed-&#xD;
posts, and quite as stiff. The chaplain, press-&#xD;
ing hard upon him, looked over his shoulder,&#xD;
while Deb brought up the rear like a veteran&#xD;
grenadier.I&#xD;
Judith raised herself a little in the attitude&#xD;
of alarm ras the sergeant came in ; and it was&#xD;
at her that that continental hero was gazing.&#xD;
"How, - in the namedofvHeaven " lie ex-&#xD;
claimed, " came this dove in this hawk's&#xD;
nest ?"&#xD;
" Comparisons," quoth Mother Hadley,&#xD;
" are ojus. She's here under my ruff, and I'm&#xD;
her lawful protector."&#xD;
&#xD;
i" The countenance," said Humphrey, "is&#xD;
fair and not altogether unfamiliar to my eyes ;&#xD;
it should be, methinks, one of the daughters&#xD;
of Squire Redmond."&#xD;
"Both should band is ; and this is Meg,&#xD;
the yeller gal that came to the camp with&#xD;
Miss Grindle. Why one or the other is here,&#xD;
is more'n I can tell," answered Giles, in some&#xD;
perplexity.&#xD;
pr Good friends," said Judith, " what means&#xD;
this intrusion ? Is it any service to the coun-&#xD;
try that my privacy should be intruded&#xD;
upon ?"&#xD;
"The sin of ignorance is winked at ; and&#xD;
we dreamed not that a darter of Squire Red-&#xD;
mond's would be found in this den of toryism&#xD;
-this resort of Christian Hadley's maraud-&#xD;
ers," replied the sergeant.&#xD;
" Since you know that I am here, there can&#xD;
be no further excuse for remaining. ;The&#xD;
events of this night have already greatly dis-&#xD;
turbed me, and truly I need repose. Should&#xD;
you meet my father, tell him that I am safe."&#xD;
" If God wills, I shall soon see him ; for he&#xD;
is with Rainford, in a thousand troubles about&#xD;
his darters. Tell me, Miss Judith, what be-&#xD;
came of Somerton ? Was he consumed in the&#xD;
house, or taken by the enemy ?"&#xD;
"Much I fear that the unfortunate colonel,&#xD;
together with my sister, Miriam, perished in&#xD;
the flames.  Judge, then, sergeant, of the&#xD;
state of my mind, and leave me."&#xD;
" Pardon me, young lady," said Humphrey,&#xD;
" and allow me to ask you if you are here of&#xD;
your own will ?"&#xD;
The eyes of Judith and Deborah Hadley&#xD;
met. The girl was painfully troubled.&#xD;
"Seeing how comfortably I am provided&#xD;
for, I think you might solve that question&#xD;
yourself," she said, evasively.&#xD;
"She come here like a bird with broken&#xD;
wings, and it would been a harder heart nor&#xD;
mine to refuse her shelter. I took her in and&#xD;
laid her in my own bed, and tried to comfort&#xD;
the poor thing,; for much she stood'in need&#xD;
on't," asserted Deb.&#xD;
" Woman," said Giles, " if you've done this,&#xD;
you've changed your nature ; and it'11 turn&#xD;
out, in my opinion, that there's some diviltry&#xD;
afoot that honest folks don't understan'."&#xD;
Judith stole a grateful look at the sturdy&#xD;
Giles ; she heard the stifled respiration of&#xD;
Deering, andhsilently prayed that the scene&#xD;
might be shortened. She felt a choking sen-&#xD;
sation in her throat, and feared she should&#xD;
faint, unable to sustain such a trying part.&#xD;
She waved her hand for her two unwelcome&#xD;
visitors to depart.&#xD;
"A thousand pardons, Miss Redmond, but&#xD;
we mustn't forget duty even for beauty. We&#xD;
believe that Guy Deerin' is somewhere in this&#xD;
cabin ; hence the cause of our intrusion. We&#xD;
are makin' thorough search. Chaplain, look&#xD;

peep under the bed and feel about'with my&#xD;
sabre a little, jest.for form's sake ; for Cap'n.&#xD;

up his mind to give the spy a good hangin',&#xD;

"Don't come no nigher Miss Judy !" said&#xD;
Meg, menacingly. - " I'll -write the, ten com-,&#xD;
mandments on yer face, if ye do !"&#xD;
"My yeller charmer, your mistress is as,&#xD;
safe as if she's in heaven," answered the ser-&#xD;
geant, gallantly, stabbing thewall under the,&#xD;
bed with his'sword.&#xD;
", Odds my life ! what a brave rebel 'tis !&#xD;
He's hackin' to chips the royal logs of the&#xD;
cabin. A rigiment of sich would carry' the&#xD;
house by storm !" sneered Mrs. Hadley, lift-,&#xD;
ing her gray eyebrows and putting her arms&#xD;
akimbo.                      .&#xD;
Judith was nearly ~dying with suspense.&#xD;
Love, fear, and timidity struggled. within her.&#xD;
"Rail op,'woman," answered Giles, quietly,.&#xD;
transfixing a petticoat with his sabre. "Your,&#xD;
tongue is the worst part of ye, and'll never be&#xD;
still till your feet p'int up'ard."&#xD;
"It's the heart, man-it's the heart that's&#xD;
desperately -wicked," corrected the chaplain.,&#xD;
"As Paul says-"&#xD;
11No matter what Paul says ; it's wlhat Rain-&#xD;
ford says that I care about !" retorted Giles,&#xD;
who now stood in the door, applying persua-.&#xD;
sive friction to his head.&#xD;
" Cruel, cruel soger-boy ! What a, wicked&#xD;
wound- you've give my bettermost petitidiot,"&#xD;
mocked Mrs. Deb, with a laugh that was; pe-&#xD;
culiar both for its silence and significance..&#xD;
The sergeant hung his head and walked.&#xD;
thoughtfully from the little compartment, the&#xD;
chaplain preceding him.&#xD;
"Keep rubbin' your head, sergeant dear,&#xD;
and you'll make it allstraight anon. There's&#xD;
no harm in pokia' about the beds of timor-&#xD;
somIe gals, and there's glory in stablin'.inno-&#xD;

" Humphrey," said Giles, abstractedly; '" I,&#xD;
a'n't satisfied.' That Guy.Dcein' come in, I&#xD;
feel sart'in ; but that he's gone out, I'n "not&#xD;
so sure. Come into'the open air, Humphrey,&#xD;
and we'll- hold a council o' war.' Alb right&#xD;
there, Tom Thornton ?"                '-&#xD;
" All right !" responded con.,  '' '&#xD;
" The butcher looked for his knife when he&#xD;
had it in his moufb," moralizedthb'dsergeant,&#xD;
and with Humphrey left the'e4bin ' The two&#xD;
were heard conferring earnestly togetherr out-&#xD;
side, while those within awaited 'the' result,&#xD;
with all-those varied emotions which their re-.&#xD;
spective positions rendered natural. &#xD;
CHAPTER XXIII.:'&#xD;
. IN THE CELLAR.&#xD;
Judith sprang from the bed the moment&#xD;
the door closed upon Giles and Humphrey.&#xD;
&#xD;
'" You have acted well'!' said Deborah Had-&#xD;
ley. "Be quiet a few minutt s longer. There's&#xD;
a wind-mill in the sergeant's head thnt' may&#xD;
turn him round one revolution too many.&#xD;
I've got ears as well as another, and must try&#xD;
to, catch a word'of that buzzing' ; for a word&#xD;
to the wise is sufficient."&#xD;
The woman went softly to that side of the&#xD;
cabin where the voices could be heard most&#xD;
distinctly. Crouching upon the floor, she put&#xD;
her ear to the wall. The sergeant and his&#xD;
-companion were but a few feet distant. The&#xD;
latter was satisfied with the search ; not so&#xD;
with -the former ; a mischievous spite was&#xD;
whiispcring suspicion.&#xD;
" It stands to reason," he said, If that a man,&#xD;
be he British or' American, royalist or rebel,&#xD;
cannot sink into the earth or fly into the air.&#xD;
Parson,';I've a feelin' that we've been in some&#xD;
way carcumvented.'&#xD;
"You were always a fellow of dull and&#xD;
heavy comprehension, and like a vicious&#xD;
horse, -ever ready to take the bit in your teeth&#xD;
and go your, own way ; had it been otherwise,&#xD;
you would long ago have been a subject of&#xD;
grace," Humphrey answered.&#xD;
"11'm nobody's' subject !" retorted Giles.&#xD;
" I cast off my allegiance when I took up arms&#xD;
'for Congress."&#xD;
"'Twould be well for you to remember,&#xD;
sergeant, that we're far from our broken and&#xD;
battered brigade, and'our' return likely to be&#xD;
cut off at any moment by straggling parties&#xD;
of _tories, or the impetuous fire-eaters of&#xD;
Tarleton. We've done all that, any one could&#xD;
reasonably expect. As Paul says-"&#xD;
- " As I've told you, parson, it is what Rain-&#xD;
ford says' that I care for, and I would thank&#xD;
'you to mention no other commander in my&#xD;
hearin' ; although the officer that you speak&#xD;
of may be very'good in his way. There's a&#xD;
little insect in my ear that worries me. I&#xD;
can't go away content till I've taken another&#xD;
look. , I was a little too tender of the feelin's&#xD;
of Miss Redmond ; and, by-the-way, Humph-&#xD;
rey, I've heerd that there's somethin' atween&#xD;
her and this same Guy Deerin'; though I&#xD;
hope to the Lord it isn't true. As a thorough&#xD;
soger, I should have passed my sabre Aown&#xD;
through that bed a few times, with all delica-&#xD;
cy and deference to the fair gal restin' like a&#xD;
snow-flake on one side on't."&#xD;
". Truly, thou art wanting in respect to the&#xD;
sex. It-would frighten the poor child within&#xD;
an inch of her life to see you thrusting and&#xD;
lunging at harmless beds and bolsters. Veri-&#xD;
ly, the 'profession of arms has hardened thy&#xD;
heart." -&#xD;
The chaplain clanked his sabre, and, beside&#xD;
the sergeant, was as Goliah to David.&#xD;
" Let not your tongue cut your throat ; for&#xD;
you know there isn't a redder sabre in the&#xD;
sheath than yours. In battle, you are Satan,&#xD;

and all the rest of the time a saint. Saddle the&#xD;
right horse, my man ! As for respect, to the gal,&#xD;
I'll show her as much as if the's my own&#xD;
sweetheart. She loves Congress and Washin'-&#xD;
ton; and if I say 'In the name of CongrEss,&#xD;
or in the name of Washin'ton,' it will be both&#xD;
law and gospel. Did you notice, Humphrey,&#xD;
that the gal had a wide-awake look, and was&#xD;
sometimes white and sometimes red in the&#xD;
face? Is it common, too, for young women&#xD;
to go to bed with their day-clothes on ? And&#xD;
mark you, sir ! I saw a little slipper peepin'&#xD;
from beneath the bed-coverings, which strikes&#xD;
me i out o' the common order, and ag'in na-&#xD;
tur'."&#xD;
Humphrey mused, throwing his weight upon&#xD;
one limb, and then upon the other.&#xD;
" In the excitement, confusion, and terror&#xD;
of these times, the common usages of life are&#xD;
often violated ; however, if you think it best,&#xD;
'we'll return and go over our work again."&#xD;
" A thing that is worth doing, is worth&#xD;
doing well. Let us move off a few steps, and&#xD;
then come back of a sudden ; if there is any-&#xD;
thing in the wind, we may find them off their&#xD;
guard."&#xD;
The two men walked out of ear-range, but&#xD;
Deborah Hadley had heard sufficient.- Judith&#xD;
had observed her attentively, and now gath-&#xD;
ered from her expression that there was new&#xD;
danger.&#xD;
"Come out, lad, come out !" she cried.&#xD;
"They're coming' back!"&#xD;
Deering sprang from his hiding-place,&#xD;
where he had been half smothered. Drops of&#xD;
moisture were onhis brow. He gave Judith a&#xD;
look of unspeakable gratitude.&#xD;
" Sweet girl, I owe you life !" he murmur-&#xD;
ed, as he passed her in obedience to a signal&#xD;
from Deb, who 'opened the trap-door.&#xD;
" Why is this ?" asked Judith. "Was he&#xD;
not safer where he was ? If so, to save human&#xD;
life-"&#xD;
" No, no! The s ispicions of the sergeant&#xD;
are, already directed to the bed ; he'll probe&#xD;
every inch on't with his long sabre."&#xD;
"'Anal if he goes into the cellar, discovery&#xD;
will be equally certain,"- said Judith, in much&#xD;
alarm.&#xD;
" Distress not yourself, dear young lady,&#xD;
for one who lives in' daily expectation of a&#xD;
violent death ; one who has counted the cost,&#xD;
and will not shrink from the payment when&#xD;
the bill of mortality becomes due. It is plea-&#xD;
sant 1o know that I have your sympathy, and&#xD;
that   withstanding I am infamous in Miss&#xD;
Redn   l's eyes---"&#xD;
" C  e, for Heaven's sake ! your enemies&#xD;
are at'the door. Down! down! and God in&#xD;
his mercy save you."&#xD;
"The door is fastened," said Mother Had-&#xD;
ley. " I can delay them a minute." She&#xD;
thrust the fitful candle through the opening&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
f: i&#xD;
.!&#xD;
,f&#xD;
&#xD;
in the floor. " Look !" she continued, coldly&#xD;
and firmly. " Behold that carcass ; a devil&#xD;
once lived in it, but has gone out, not by&#xD;
fasting nor prayer, but by the rope. Jump&#xD;
down, and hide under that black lump of&#xD;
mortality. Pull his great body and limbs over&#xD;
you. Do not fear him; he is more harmless&#xD;
now than for any time these twenty years.&#xD;
Shrink not-all are of a color in the dark."&#xD;
The spy threw a look of ineffable meaning&#xD;
at Judith, and sprang into the vault.&#xD;
" It never shall be said," muttered the wo-&#xD;
man, " that Deb Hadley hasn't done what she&#xD;

- Then to Miss Redmond :&#xD;
"Back to bed, gal, back to - bed lDon't&#xD;
fear their swords, for your person's, as safe&#xD;
with em, for that matter. as 'twould be at your&#xD;
own h'arth-st one. Behave as well as you did&#xD;
afore, and we'll outwit 'em, yet. Meg, you im-&#xD;
age ! in with your mistress, and see that your&#xD;
tongue keeps its place."&#xD;
She closed the trap. The sergeant was by&#xD;
this time kicking at the door.&#xD;
" Who's come now ?" demanded Mrs. Had-&#xD;
ley, ill-humoredly.&#xD;
" Them that hasn't seen fit to go; so slip&#xD;
the bolt, Cap'n Deb, and don't keep two hon-&#xD;
est men on the wrong side of the door."&#xD;
Deb bustled to the door with an affectation&#xD;
of promptness, and pulled some seconds at the&#xD;
bolt.&#xD;
" Be patient, my dears ; it'll start presently.&#xD;
There-here it comes !"&#xD;
" She is too affectionate ; the wolf has crawl-&#xD;
ed into the lamb's skin !" grumbled Giles.&#xD;
" Don't mind disturbin' a lone woman, or&#xD;
frightenin' to death poor Miss Redmond. Don't&#xD;
be partic'lar, sergeant, because in war-time&#xD;
murder, an' robbery, an' fright go for nothin'.&#xD;
Spin this thing out as long as you can, for&#xD;
presently my son 9hristian'll be here, with his&#xD;
Royal Americans, and his long sword by his&#xD;
side."&#xD;
"The quicker he comes, the better!" re-&#xD;
torted the chaplain, grasping, suddenly, the&#xD;
hilt of his sabre.&#xD;
"Pestilent hypocrite ! you're throwed off&#xD;
your guard now an' then !" exclaimed Deb,&#xD;
with an abrupt return of her fierceness. " I&#xD;
know what ye come for, ye rebel hounds ! The&#xD;
gal's in there ; go and murder her, if ye like ;&#xD;
but remember that her father's a rebel and&#xD;
she's of your own way o' thinkin'."&#xD;
" Nobody talks o' murder, old woman !&#xD;
'Tisn't the Continental boys that make war on&#xD;
women and abuse .helpless gals. Away, you&#xD;
sparrow-hawk !" answered Giles, gruffly. He&#xD;
then raised his voice, and added: "'Tis I,&#xD;
Sergeant Giles, Miss. Redmond. Don't be&#xD;
afeard. The liberty boys know their friends&#xD;
as well as they do their enemies. God knows&#xD;
we wont disturb ye more'n we can help, but&#xD;

OR, HIRL THE HUNCHBACK..&#xD;
&#xD;
the fact is, we a'n't yet satisfied. Rainford is&#xD;
a devil pf a feller when his blood's up, and&#xD;
you wouldn't want me faulted, I'm sure, jes'&#xD;
for neglectin' to murder the bed with my&#xD;
sabre."&#xD;
Giles gently opened the door leading to the&#xD;
suspected quarter.&#xD;
" I had hoped," said Judith, complainingly,&#xD;
"that after the terrible excitements of this&#xD;
eventful night, I should be permitted a few&#xD;
moments of undistrbed repose."&#xD;
The pale face of Judith, the mournful se-&#xD;
verity of her words, taken in conjunction with&#xD;
her surroundings, brought Giles to a full-stop.&#xD;
" Poor, dear lamb ! She can't stan' dis yer&#xD;
muc'h longer !" whined Meg, dolorously. " De&#xD;
life's jest about gone out her precious body.&#xD;
I wish to de Lor' dar wa'n't no Congress an' no&#xD;
liberty !"&#xD;
"I beg prdon,miss-I really don't mean-&#xD;
that is, I didn'tcome-" the sergeant began,&#xD;
but the word stuck in his throat.&#xD;
"I had' flattered myself," resumed Judith,&#xD;
id the same deprecating tone, " that the&#xD;
daughter of your friend, Sergeant Giles, would&#xD;
find a place in every patriotic heart."&#xD;
"By Heavens, Miss Judith, you have two&#xD;
places in mine !" cried Giles. "If you wanted&#xD;
it fo'r a pin-cushion, I don't know but I should&#xD;
take it out and give it to fou. But I've got a&#xD;
stern mistress, whose name is Duty, young&#xD;
lady ; and, as a soger-lad, I must stick to her&#xD;
through thick and thin. Duty, miss, says I&#xD;
must search that bed you're layin' on ; and&#xD;
on my knees, as 'twere, I beg of you to&#xD;
rise."&#xD;
" He's going' to steal the dientical bed she's&#xD;
layin' on, and lie's going' to drife her up at the&#xD;
p'int of his sword in her night-gown !" said&#xD;
Meg, rocking her body to and fro, in much&#xD;
apparent distress.&#xD;
"I should suppose that my friendless situ.&#xD;
ation," resumed Judith, determined to make as&#xD;
much delay as possible, " would soften the&#xD;
heart of Cornwallis himself, were he present, to&#xD;
1 witness my distress."&#xD;
Giles turned to the chaplipin for assistance,&#xD;
for Tarleton's dragoons would not have been&#xD;
so formidable as Judith's eyes.&#xD;
" The duty is not a pleasant one," said&#xD;
Humphrey, coming in a prompt and resolute&#xD;
manner to the rescue, "but we know what is&#xD;
expected Qf us. Miss Redmond is quitephwar&#xD;
that we would shed our blood in her defence;&#xD;
and her plausible words seem to me but an&#xD;
idle pretext to gain time, for some object best&#xD;
known to herself.".-&#xD;
"Whatever may be your virtues, reverend&#xD;
sir, charity does not appear to be one of them&#xD;
] am in your power, and you can enforce youi&#xD;
commands. I really feel- too weak to arise&#xD;
' r me your hand, Meg ; these gentlemen&#xD;
.  be obeyed. There must needs bet&#xD;
&#xD;
85&#xD;
&#xD;
British spy concealed in the bolster or in the&#xD;
straw-mattress."&#xD;
" Beauty is duty, Miss Judith," said Giles,&#xD;
and the moment Miss Redmond's feet touched&#xD;
the floor, stalked sturdily to the bed, and com-&#xD;
menced a slashing assault upon it with his&#xD;
sword.&#xD;
" What bravery ! what courage!" laughed&#xD;
Mrs. Hadley.-     .&#xD;
The sergeant having probed the bed to his&#xD;
satisfaction, turned from it with obvious dis-&#xD;
appointment.&#xD;
" I thought it meant something," he mut-&#xD;
tered. " Her manner justified suspicion."&#xD;
" I hope you are satisfied ?" otLserved Ju-&#xD;
dith.&#xD;
" We are convinced that the man we seek&#xD;
is not here. I trust you will bear witness,&#xD;
Miss Redmond, that we have discharged our&#xD;
duty," said the chaplain, bowing, and retiring&#xD;
into the next room.&#xD;
" One more look into the cellar," added&#xD;
Giles, " and I shall be satisfied."&#xD;
" What !" screamed Mrs. Hadley. "Must&#xD;
there be more botheration ? Iavmn' give ye&#xD;
leave to s'arch my house like an honest wo-&#xD;
man, can't, you go away decently, or must ye&#xD;
hang round till morning , keeping' them awake&#xD;
as sorely needs sleep, and burnin' out my&#xD;
candles as if a lone widder hadn't nothin' else&#xD;
to do but make 'em."&#xD;
Humphrey, having the unpleasant recollee-&#xD;
tion of Jaffer in his mind, added his voice to&#xD;
the woman's, in an attempt to dissuade Giles&#xD;
from his purpose. But he was a man not to&#xD;
be turned aside when once resolved.' Deb, af-&#xD;
ter some argumentation, reluctantly sprang&#xD;
the trap.&#xD;
"Down," said she, "if down you must;&#xD;
but my word for't, it'll bring ye to grief."&#xD;
" Give me the candle, hag ! Come on, par-&#xD;
son."&#xD;
" Nay," replied Humphrey, " I enre not for&#xD;
a second look ; and you're such a brave lad&#xD;
you'll do well enough without me."&#xD;
," It'll be a fine story to carry back to our&#xD;
dragoons that an able-bodied parson is afeard&#xD;
of a dead darkey ! What's a man good for&#xD;
that's scared' at the sight of a corpse ."&#xD;
" Say no more, scoffer, for I am with you.&#xD;
It's little that I care for men, living or dead,&#xD;
armed as I am with the sword of the flesh and&#xD;
the sword of the spirit "&#xD;
The parson swung .is muscular body into&#xD;
the cellar, and groped about after Giles, who&#xD;
t poked in every corner with his sword, and&#xD;
overturned everything that could by any pos-&#xD;
I sible chance conceal a human figure.&#xD;
"How is it ?" queried Humphrey, sarcasti-&#xD;
r call. " Is that little insect still in your ear ?"&#xD;
The sergeant looked over his shoulder to&#xD;
n give Humphrey a sharp reply, and, coming&#xD;
a unwittingly upon the body of Jaffer, tumbled&#xD;
&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
over it. The light was extinguished by his&#xD;
fall, and he found himself upon the could lump&#xD;
of mortality, in the midst of a darkness that&#xD;
was most intense.&#xD;
" By Heavens! he breathes - his heart&#xD;
beat s -he is warm!" cried Giles. There was&#xD;
a slence of a moment, in which the sergeant's&#xD;
hands and senses. were busy ; then there was&#xD;
a sudden outcry.&#xD;
"Here he is! here he is! help, help !"&#xD;
Immediately there followed a struggle, and&#xD;
the trap-door was instantly closed. The chap-&#xD;
lain stcood paralyzed with superstitious awe.&#xD;
It appeared to him tlhat that .black horror,&#xD;
Jaffcr, had revived and grappled with his&#xD;
friend.&#xD;
"Verily, we are best by the powers of&#xD;
darkness !' he exclaimed. "Bring a - light,&#xD;
woman, bring a light !"&#xD;
Humphrey might as well have been in the&#xD;
centre of the earth for all the eff et his words&#xD;
produced. He heard the crack and strain of&#xD;
. in.b opposed to limb and muscle to muscle,&#xD;
as Giles and his unseen adversary roll d upon&#xD;
the ground and tugged at each other in vari-&#xD;
ous positions.&#xD;
" Contendest thou with man or devil ?" de-&#xD;
manded the chaplain, in an excit ed voice.&#xD;
Before he received a reply, the invisible com-&#xD;
batants had struggled to their feet and fallen&#xD;
again heavily.&#xD;
" For God's sake, Humphrey, help me !"&#xD;
answered Giks, speaking with extreme diffi-&#xD;
culty.&#xD;
" A candle, woman, a candle !" roared the&#xD;
chaplain.&#xD;
"1Short'll be the bit o' candle that ye'11 git&#xD;
from me, and long'll be the time ye'll wait for&#xD;
it!" screamed Deb from above.&#xD;
" Accursed witch of Endor !" exclaimed&#xD;
Humphrey. "As I live she has fastened the&#xD;
door upon us!"&#xD;
" Ay, that I have ! and it won't open ag'in&#xD;
till ye-re fine enough for the wind to blow ye&#xD;
away."&#xD;
"What means the sorceress ?" said the be-&#xD;
wildered chaplain, feeling about in the inky&#xD;
blackness.&#xD;
Giles and his antagonist rolled to his feet.&#xD;
" Avaunt ! man or dcvil, now I have thee !"&#xD;
and casting himself desperately upon the&#xD;
twain, seized one by the throat.&#xD;
" Help ! help !" gasped Giles in a choking&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"Be of good cheer, sergeant, for I am help-&#xD;
ing thee mightily. I have Apollyon by the&#xD;
throat, and if he have not an extraordinary&#xD;
tenacity of life, I will soon finish him."&#xD;
While the parson was speaking, he who&#xD;
was uppermost disengaged himself and slip-&#xD;
ped away, while the throttled man writhed and&#xD;
twisted beneath the iron fingers that clutched&#xD;
him.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Fool!" said a voice from out the dark-&#xD;
ness. " Wouldst thou strangle thy friend ?"&#xD;
"Good God!" cried Humphrey.     " What&#xD;
am I doing ?"&#xD;
He rehnquished his hold&#xD;
" By the Lord !" muttered Giles, the breath&#xD;
rattling in his throat. "I'll have you hanged&#xD;
in sight of the whole regiment! A moment&#xD;
longer and my business would have been done.&#xD;
What in the devil's name possesses ye ?"&#xD;
" Friend Giles, it was a device of Satan, by&#xD;
which I was to be made guilty of thy death."&#xD;
" Device of Satan or not, if I could see, I&#xD;
would plant as good a blow between thy two&#xD;
eyes as ever felled an ox !" answered the mndig-&#xD;
nant Giles.&#xD;
"It was but a mistake. The best of us do&#xD;
not always hit the nail on the head, nor is our&#xD;
zeal at all times according to knowledge,"&#xD;
replied Humphrey, apologetically.&#xD;
"Parson, unwittingly youhive done me an&#xD;
ill turn, which at present I can't forgive ;.but&#xD;
what voice was it that relaxed your grasp at&#xD;
my throat ?"&#xD;
" I know not, if it were not thy late adver-&#xD;
sary, which seemeth to me unreasonable."&#xD;
" My late adversary," answered Giles, "was&#xD;
no doubt him of whom we are in search, and&#xD;
for the good turn he has done me he shall&#xD;
hang the easier. I will cover the rope with&#xD;
silk that it shall not chafe his neck."&#xD;
"For which he will thank thee, no doubt,"&#xD;
responded Humphrey, drvly. "Well, we have&#xD;
him ; the next thing is to get out with him."&#xD;
"Hillo, old woman ! let up-let up !" shout-&#xD;
ed the sergeant.&#xD;
" Do ye surrender yourselves prisoners of&#xD;
war ?" queried Captain Deb, in a shrill voice.&#xD;
" Devil a bit on't! so open, quick, or I'll&#xD;
raise the very old Nick with your shanty.&#xD;
You've tricked me once, but you can't do it&#xD;
twice. I've got your tory spy fast and tight,&#xD;
and advise ye, as a reasonable critter, to open&#xD;
that trap to let us go out with our prisoner. In&#xD;
case of your refusal, I'll cut the spy into inch&#xD;
pieces, as true as I'm a sergeant in the Conti-&#xD;
nental Army."&#xD;
" As for the Tad, Guy Deerin, he can take&#xD;
keer of himself  in a place so black that jou&#xD;
can't see a hand afore ye. The lad wasn't&#xD;
made for liangin', and hung he eha'n't be. He&#xD;
shall burn first ! Ay ! I'11 burn ye all in a&#xD;
heap, if ye don't stan' back and 'low him free&#xD;
and unobstructed passage from the cellar. and&#xD;
ten minutes slart after he leaves the cabin.&#xD;
What say ye to that, ye hounds o' the Conti-&#xD;
nental Congress ?" retorted Deb.&#xD;
" You crow loud for an old hen," returned&#xD;
Giles, " but it will go bard with us if we a'n't&#xD;
up there of our own exertions in less tham a&#xD;
minute."&#xD;
" Try it, my dears, try it !" answered the&#xD;
determined Hadley.&#xD;

OfWoman,"' argued Giles, who saw the ne-&#xD;
cessity of rendering her pliable, " you're a&#xD;
reg'lar trump ; and I never thought the worse&#xD;
of ye for havin' pluck. To be sure, I've ban-&#xD;
died words with ye and had my jest ; but&#xD;
that's human natur', and I'm sure, at heart, I&#xD;
never meant ye any evil."&#xD;
The sergeant's voice was quite penitent and&#xD;
subdued.&#xD;
" The devil was sick; the devil-a monk wouldbe ;&#xD;
The devil was well, the devil a monk was he !"&#xD;
replied Mrs. Deb Hadley, totally unmovedby&#xD;
Giles' rhetoric.&#xD;
" You are too hard on a body," rejoined&#xD;
the sergeant, with affected humility. " You&#xD;
are too sensible a woman to take'the rough&#xD;
waysof a soldier in earnest. Come, now ; let's&#xD;
up, that's a good old soul! Miss Redmond&#xD;
wants to sleep, and we're content to go away&#xD;
with our prisoner, besides givin' you a guinea&#xD;
for your trouble."&#xD;
"IA cunnin' knave has a cunnin' trick,"&#xD;
quoth Mrs. Hadley.' " You'like proverbs, and&#xD;
it were a burnin' shame if you didn't have&#xD;
enough of 'em when you're stannin' as 'twere,&#xD;
on the edge of etarnity. You've got a parson&#xD;
with ye, niy dear, and you won't go out the&#xD;
world 'thout the benefit o' clergy. So clap&#xD;
down and at your prayers, for I'm gettin' the&#xD;
kindlin's ready: and the whole consarn'11&#xD;
soon be in a light blaze." '&#xD;
A notable tumult immediately followed&#xD;
above ; everything seemed relapsing into&#xD;
chaos. The chaplain was holding hia wound-&#xD;
ed arm and moaning with pain ; the blackness&#xD;
of darkness was around them. Fear began to&#xD;
creep into the stout heart of the sergeant.&#xD;
" In the name of God !" he shouted, " what&#xD;
are you doin' ?"&#xD;
"rPiin' the table, and chairs, and benches,&#xD;
and feather-bed, and straw-bed in a heap over&#xD;
the trap, so's to make a jolly fire when it&#xD;
starts," was the cool rejoinder.&#xD;
",Heaven and earth !" groaned Humphrey.&#xD;
"I believe the hag means it. We shall be&#xD;
smothered here like rabbits in a hole. Truly,&#xD;
burning is a death crucifying to the flesh.&#xD;
We had better come to terms at once."&#xD;
"GTom Thorntonf! Tom ThorntonI" shouted&#xD;
Giles, at the top of his voice.-&#xD;
" Little good will it do ye to call Tom&#xD;
Thornton ; he's been snorin' for the last ten&#xD;
minutes, and the door is bolted ag'in him, be&#xD;
sides. - Make up your minds quick, for I'm&#xD;
jest goin' to clap a coal into the straw-bed!1"&#xD;
retorted Deb, rattling the fire-shovel and pok-&#xD;
ing at the fire with the tongs.&#xD;
" If we allow the spy to pass out unmolest-&#xD;
ed, what assurance have we that you'll keep&#xD;
faith with us ? Two to one, you'll shut the&#xD;
door in our faces and keep us here till your&#xD;
son comes, with his knaves at his back," in-&#xD;
&#xD;
87&#xD;
&#xD;
terrogated Giles, perceiving that the advan-&#xD;
tage was wholly with the woman.&#xD;
",Do as you like and nothin' on compuj'on.&#xD;
Trust me, or fare worse. My son Ch   ian&#xD;
will soon be here, and a fine bonfire he'll see&#xD;
if he comes not with haste."&#xD;
"Hark'ee, Mother Deb! Let Miss Judith&#xD;
vouch for your good faith, and the rogue&#xD;
shall go in peace ; but for God's sake don't&#xD;
keep us here till the poor chaplain bleeds to&#xD;
death."&#xD;
"I will-I do vouch for her 1" answered&#xD;
Judith, earnestly. "I feel assured that what-&#xD;
ever treaty you make with Mrs. Hadley, will&#xD;
be strictly carried out ; I pledge my word&#xD;
that it shall be."&#xD;
" That's the voice that I like to hear ! The&#xD;
matter's settled. Cap'n Deb, I surender !&#xD;
Guy Deerin', you sly, invisible fiend, luck&#xD;
has stood your friend once more. You've&#xD;
heerd what's been said, and how we're car-&#xD;
cumvented. Mother Deb hovers ye as if you's&#xD;
one of her own chickens. I'm sorry, mister,&#xD;
you've got into such a brood, and if you ain't&#xD;
hanged for't, it'll be no fault of mine."&#xD;
Deering had arisen, and was standing near&#xD;
the trap.&#xD;
"There are few things that we see with the&#xD;
same eyes," he answered, in a suppressed&#xD;
voice. "You and I, Sergeant Giles, do not,&#xD;
and may never understand each other.'&#xD;
" I don't know as I greatly care to have a&#xD;
better understanding. One thing, however, I&#xD;
should like to know, and that is, why you&#xD;
didn't let this blunderin' parson strangle me ?"&#xD;
said the sergeant.&#xD;
" My motives I have little time and less in-&#xD;
clination to explain. When we meet again-"&#xD;
" May it be at the foot qf the gallows 1" in-&#xD;
terrupted Giles.&#xD;
" You are, indeed, an unforgiving enemy,"&#xD;
added Deering, sadly.&#xD;
" Love of country is in my blood," quoth&#xD;
Giles. " I hate everything that is treacher-&#xD;
ous and underhanded, as 'twere. I've done&#xD;
my best to take ye, and I think you won't ob-&#xD;
ject as a triflin' favor to say as much, should&#xD;
you chance to fall in with Rainford, which is&#xD;
very probable."&#xD;
vI can testify," responded the spy, "that&#xD;
y e'have hunted me like hounds. Ay ! it ha%-&#xD;
been the same thing over and over for months&#xD;
*-flight and pursuit, pursuit and flight. I&#xD;
*shall die one day, I doubt not, ignominiously ;&#xD;
scoffed at by neighbors and kinsmen, despised&#xD;
by those whose principles I respect."   -&#xD;
" Then I eihort thee to turn 'away from fol-&#xD;
- lowing after strange gods," said Humphrey,&#xD;
with emphasis." As Paul says-"&#xD;
" tAs I've often told ye, parson, it's what&#xD;
Rainford says that does the business," retort-&#xD;

THE SWORDMAKER OF THE SANTE&#xD;
&#xD;
The trap-door sprang open with a creaking,&#xD;
dissonant sound.&#xD;
"Farewell," said Deering. " Iforgive you&#xD;
as much as man may for the strait to which&#xD;
I have this night been reduced. To the an-&#xD;
gel who saved me from your misguided wrath,"&#xD;
he added, as he sprang from the vault and&#xD;
stood beside Judith, "I shall ever, 'ever be&#xD;
,grateful."&#xD;
" Speak not of it, but fly. I have listened&#xD;
to the pleadings of mercy, for the pains and&#xD;
penalties of thy trade shock me, and may not&#xD;
be lightly borne by weak human nature. De-&#xD;
part, Guy Deering, if the way be clear, and&#xD;
let us mutually -pray that we may meet no&#xD;
.more in this mutable world."&#xD;
The accents of Judith were low and touch-&#xD;
.ing.&#xD;
The spy stood before her with an expression&#xD;
'of indescribable melancholy.&#xD;
"Such a prayer, beautiful Judith, I cannot&#xD;
'offer. Thou hast been the one solitary ray of&#xD;
happiness that has shone, through the dark&#xD;
-cloud of my life."                  ,&#xD;
"Marry, come up!" exclaimed Deb. "You're&#xD;
makin' love to my son Christian's wife! But&#xD;
that's not the game for you, lad. Come! it's&#xD;
time you was movin'. I'll open the door soft,&#xD;
so's not to disturb Thornton, and then, my&#xD;
fine royal British boy, ti'ust to your legs."&#xD;
" The wife of Christian Hadley !" murmured&#xD;
Deering,.with less surprise than Judith ex-&#xD;
pected to see him exhibit. "What mockery&#xD;
is this ?".&#xD;
" Stay not, I entreat!" cried Judith. "You&#xD;
have heard the truth, terrible as 'it is. The&#xD;
-door is open. Hush! sp itk not1"&#xD;
"Come, my gallant boy!" whispered Deb.&#xD;

"At nothin', child ! it was mere bravado ;&#xD;
and to tell uswhat he would do if he had a&#xD;
chance. But the day of sich unnat'rals is&#xD;
short, whiph is some comfort. Darter-in-law,&#xD;
you're a brave girl; and it's a thousand pities&#xD;
that you don't love my son Christian, with&#xD;
his right royal red, and his commission in his&#xD;
pocket."          ,&#xD;
" Speak not of him-. Have I not enough&#xD;
to think of-the destruction of my home, the&#xD;
dispersion of my friends, and the doubt that&#xD;
involves the fate of Miriam? Woman, the&#xD;
north and the south are not farther distant&#xD;
than your son and myself."&#xD;
"I know that we aren't all made up alike,&#xD;

p'ison for another. But it's a matter o' time,&#xD;
gal; all a matter o' time ! A great doctor is&#xD;
Time ; he brings round his patients arter&#xD;
awhile, curin''em with doses of days, months,&#xD;
and years. I've seen them as wanted to die,&#xD;
reconciled to their fate, and made to rejoice&#xD;
in it."&#xD;
"I hear somethin'," said Meg.&#xD;
" There's allers noises hereabouts. The&#xD;
dead and splintered branches creak on the&#xD;
trees ; the leaves go scurrin' afore the wind,&#xD;
and rabbits and squirrels scamper across the&#xD;
woodland paths," answered Deb.&#xD;
"It's none o' them yer, but the rumblin' of&#xD;
a wagon," replied Meg.&#xD;
"Meg is right, I think," said Judith. "I&#xD;
certainly hear the rattle of whee!s."&#xD;
" I hear it; your young ears are sharper'n&#xD;
mine. It seems as if we should have no rest&#xD;
this blessed night ; fast as one goes, another&#xD;
comes. Listen a minute !"&#xD;
All were silent.&#xD;
"Whoa, Crazy ! A'n't agoin' to r-un your&#xD;
head ag'in a cabin door, be ye ? Hold up,&#xD;
ne'tur !"&#xD;
"It's the Swordmaker of the Santee !" said&#xD;
Deb, joyfully. '- He's a simple-minded, harm-&#xD;
'less old boy, and '11 do nobody any mischief.&#xD;
He has often passed here with his horse and&#xD;
-cart. He's pooty old, and has a monstrous&#xD;
-hump on his back ; but is no fool for all that.&#xD;
We've had many a good talk together about&#xD;
the times, the king, the war, and the liberty."&#xD;
Judith's heart beat fast with expectation.&#xD;
She felt a secret assurance of assistance.&#xD;
"Who's without?" demanded Deborah,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
harshly.&#xD;
" Yes, I've been out," answered the piping&#xD;

Hadley. "I hope to goodness they'll fall in of the lads. Open the door, Goody, and let&#xD;

brands." ,                               fulness, and the bent figure of Hirl crossed,&#xD;
"What did he fire at?" asked Judith, still the threshold.&#xD;
-anxious for Deering.                     "You'll never find the door o' Deb Hadley&#xD;

" Yes, I've come to your aid. I seed your&#xD;
son Chrstian in the thickest o' the skrim-&#xD;
mage ; and proud he looked in his royal red,&#xD;
with histlong swo  d, his gold shoulder-knots,&#xD;
and his commission in his pocket ! Lord !&#xD;
Loid! what a extr'ordiner boy ! Ah, if I'd&#xD;
had sich a offspring! But it wasn't to be;&#xD;
no, it  can't to be."&#xD;
" Dear, dear ! what a pleasant way you&#xD;
have with ye ! So you seed -my son Christian&#xD;
a facing' his foes, and a cuttin' 'em down like&#xD;
thistle-leads. I wish his old mother could&#xD;
been there !  The liberty's dead, don't ye&#xD;

"My name is Ilirley ; Hirl, for short,&#xD;
though ill-mannered people,-"&#xD;
" Confound the ill-.mannered people that&#xD;
speak ill of one that speaks well of my son&#xD;
Christian'! Odds my life ! seems as if I could&#xD;

" Fire !  I's smelt dat yer dis seven or&#xD;

" You can't put it out !" screamed Hirl.&#xD;
"The thatch is a 1 a blaze. I seed it come-&#xD;
ways off. My stars ! if'this pootty young&#xD;
woman isn't Miss Redmond. How on airth&#xD;
did she git here? Well, it makes no odds ;&#xD;
you can ail tumble into my cart, and if there's&#xD;
an' animal that can take ye over the ground,&#xD;
it's Crazy. She's 'leven year old, but she be&#xD;
a smart one, I vow !"&#xD;
"A curse on that sleepy dog ! he didn't&#xD;
fire his pi-tol for nothin . The roofs in a&#xD;
blaze!  When the sun rises, Deb Hadley&#xD;
won't have a place to lay her head."&#xD;
The woman looked defiantly up at the roof,&#xD;
down which puffs of smoke now began to&#xD;
drive.&#xD;
"Let it burn, Goody Hadley. There's&#xD;
timber in the forest to make another, and&#xD;
willin' hands among the Royal 'Mericans to&#xD;
build if. Cheer up, old mother ! don't never&#xD;
complain till you have the neuralagy and the&#xD;
rheumaticss, and are as hard o' he.arin' as a&#xD;
whale at the bottom o' the ocean," answered&#xD;
Hirl, rubbing his hands, encouragingly, and&#xD;
obviously mustering a great deal of philoso-&#xD;
phy for the benefit of Captain Deb.&#xD;
"It's easy enough to make comfort for&#xD;
'others, old man, when you're goin' on smooth&#xD;
yourself! But I'll have it out of 'em for this.&#xD;
My son Christian shall cut 'em up, and hang&#xD;
'em up, too. What a world 'tis, when men&#xD;
forgit their 'leigance to the king, and go run-&#xD;
nin' arter liberty and Mr. Washin'ton, Con-&#xD;
gress, and others !"&#xD;
The injured woman seemed on the point of&#xD;
appealing to Heaven for help -against rebels&#xD;
and 'wrongs.&#xD;

a great creetur to go ! I'll take ye to a place&#xD;
where a dog won't dare to move his tongue,"&#xD;
replied the swordmaker, gently leading Ju-&#xD;
dith from the cabin.&#xD;
" That's right, grandaddy ! Be keerful o'&#xD;
my son Christian's wife," said Mrs. Hadley,&#xD;
approvingly.&#xD;
" No, I can't hear no fife. Can't hear a&#xD;
bugle 'less -it's pootty near. One o' my ears,&#xD;
you see, is tore all to bits. IHeerd the groans&#xD;
o' the wounded, though, when Tarleton tackled&#xD;
Somerton's drag'ons. Bless me! how the reb-&#xD;
els fit !  That devil,-Rainford, made a great&#xD;
swarth right through the kurnil's calvary.&#xD;
There was two royalists to one rebel ; but&#xD;
I'll die if I didn't think, one spell, that the&#xD;
rebels would git the best on't."&#xD;
" No more o' that, if you want me to ride&#xD;
in your cartI" cried Mother Hadley.' "Woe&#xD;
is meI what a sad sight to see it burn.&#xD;
What'll Christian do for the housekeepin' and&#xD;
the wife? D'ye think I can leave it, man,&#xD;
without grief ? And where will ye go ? What&#xD;
spot of airth is there where D b Hacley can&#xD;
find another home ready at, hand ?"&#xD;
" Trust your brave son for that, and hop&#xD;
into the cart. Miss Judith can set on the seat&#xD;
with the old man, and you and the caller&#xD;
creetur can stow yourselves 'mong the lug-&#xD;
gage ; there's plenty o' room-plenty on t.&#xD;
Come,:Goody, bear a hand! Don't be nus-&#xD;
sin' your troubles; they'll grow fast .enongh&#xD;
without care."&#xD;
Deborah Hadley, with much complaining&#xD;
and muttering, finally mounted the cart, and&#xD;
rode away with her face 'turned sorrowfuly&#xD;
to her burning cabin.&#xD;
" You'll know how good it is, now, to be&#xD;
burned out," said Hirl. " Many, beside your-&#xD;
self, have been' made houselcss this night.&#xD;
Squire Redmond's house, and stables, and&#xD;
negro huts have turned to ashes since sun-&#xD;
set."&#xD;
"Tell me, good swordmaker," said Judith,&#xD;
with trembling eagerness, "if you were near&#xD;
during that terrible scene ; and can you give&#xD;
me any information respecting my sister Mir-&#xD;
iam ?"&#xD;
"Thank God, I can !" answered the sword-&#xD;
maker, with 'a fervor that made Deborah&#xD;
Hadley start. "She was rescued from the&#xD;
flames ; she is safe."&#xD;
" Heaven bless you, old man, for this as-&#xD;
surance I You relieve me of an op presive and&#xD;
terrible anxiety. And Colonel Someton ?"&#xD;
" He was saved, too. How young gals take&#xD;
to handsome uniforms! Now, if it had been&#xD;
an old man like me, no one would took the&#xD;
trouble to ask about me. But that's natur', I&#xD;
s'pose."&#xD;

THE SWORDMAKER OF THE SANTEE;'OR, HIRL THE HUNCHBACK.&#xD;
&#xD;
forgotten, and I trust my memory is good.&#xD;
But where are you driving us ?"&#xD;
To a place where you'll be safe enough,&#xD;
I'll warrant."&#xD;
The swordmaker touched his mare with his&#xD;
whip, and she started- at a pace which soon&#xD;
took them to the end of their journey, which&#xD;
was an unfihfished and deserted house on the&#xD;
marin of the forest.&#xD;
It was built by a rebel," said Hirl, "who&#xD;
left it half done to go a sogerin', and it's ten to&#xD;
one if he ever comes back."&#xD;
The first beams of morning were glittering&#xD;
in the east, when Judith followed the sword-&#xD;
maker into the dwelling. The first object that&#xD;
met her view was Miriam. Goody Grindle,&#xD;
who as usual was performing the office of&#xD;
nurse, had fallen asleep upon' her post ; she&#xD;
was brought reluctantly from her dreams by&#xD;
the hurried footsteps of Judith, as she sprang&#xD;
tot embrace her sister. Glancing about the&#xD;
room, Judith saw Somerton approaching from&#xD;
an obscure corner. There was a flush upon his&#xD;
face, and unusual vivacity iin his expression.&#xD;
The young lady extended her hand, saying :&#xD;
"Surely, colonel, you have been the subject&#xD;
of magical arts, else I should, see you en a&#xD;
couch of pain."         -r&#xD;
" I think I may affirm ,safely that I have&#xD;
been under the influence of necromancy since&#xD;
I rode in the swordmaker's cart to the present&#xD;
moment."&#xD;
He looked at Miriam expressively, who&#xD;
averted her eyes..&#xD;
"Not to your'harm, Ihope," replied Judith,&#xD;
smilingly.&#xD;
"To my everlasting good, I firmly be-&#xD;
lieve !" he answered,,with a fervor that was&#xD;
quite enigmatical to Judith.&#xD;
"Don't look so puzzled-like, child 1" cried&#xD;
Goody Grindle, who -was by this time wide&#xD;
awake. " There's been queer doin's this night.&#xD;
Bless us, Miriam! you needn't wink and blink&#xD;
at me to keep me from talkin', for it's my&#xD;
nature to be continually runnin' on. The truth&#xD;
is, Judy-and the truth must come out when&#xD;
I have anything to do with it-the colonel's&#xD;
been and made love to Miriam, thinkin' it was&#xD;
you;. and I'll perish if I don't think she's ac-&#xD;
cepted him, burns, petticoat, and all, jest as he&#xD;
stands."&#xD;
At this juncture, Deborah Hadley, who had&#xD;
stood in the back-ground, advanced,-and con-&#xD;
fronted Somerton.&#xD;
"Dear goodness ! here's a pair on us, I&#xD;
should say. War sort of mixes up things&#xD;
don't it ?" she said, with a.comical leer thai&#xD;
was quite irresistible.&#xD;
Somerton glanced at his novel toilet, for he&#xD;
still wore the petticoat that Betsey Grindle, in&#xD;
her superabundant kindness, had invested him&#xD;
with, and joined heartily in the laugh that wa&#xD;
raised at his expense.&#xD;
&#xD;
" You're an odd figger to make love," added&#xD;
Deborah ; " and it's the luckiest thing in the&#xD;
world that' yqu, didn't set your heart on my&#xD;
son Christian's wife."&#xD;
"Wife ?" repeated Somerton, vaguely.&#xD;
"Nothin' less nor more," answered Deb,&#xD;
stiffly, then turning to Judith, added: "Ihave&#xD;
pleasure in introducin' to you and everybody,&#xD;
my darter-in-law, Mrs.'Judith, Hadley, wife of&#xD;
Christian Hadley, captain of the Royal Amer-&#xD;
icans, with his commission in his pocket,&#xD;
signed by the 'king himself."&#xD;
" What's the lunatic talkin' about ?" queried&#xD;
Betsey Grindle, her pride beginning to mount&#xD;
to her face. " This is my niece, and the wife&#xD;
of nobody, much less of that infamous tory,&#xD;
Christian Hadley, the mention of whose name&#xD;
makes her pale as a lily."&#xD;
" Ask the gal!" retorted Deborah, defiantly.&#xD;
" She won't deny that she was brought to my&#xD;
house, that a parson was sent for and came,&#xD;
and the ceremony was performed."&#xD;
"What means this, Judith ?" cried Miriam.&#xD;
"Speak, Meg !"&#xD;
" They've jes' done gone married her, whe-&#xD;
ther she would or no. I heerd the whole cere-&#xD;
mony ; but goodness, Miss Merry ! she was in&#xD;
a dead faint, an4 I-don't believe sensed a dozen&#xD;
words of it. I sot there a holdin' on to her,&#xD;
and I prayed ; and I prayed ; and I prayed&#xD;
that dem, yer wheels-o' time would roll 'em all&#xD;
into eternity together."&#xD;
"Know you anything of this ?" asked Som-&#xD;
erton, looking at the swordmaker.&#xD;
"I know what- they say, kurnil, and if the&#xD;
marriage is binded, DebHadley has got a nice&#xD;
darter-in-law."&#xD;
Judith was by this time nearly insensible,&#xD;
and Miriam and her aunt were hanging over&#xD;
her in great alarm and bewilderment.&#xD;
"These wrongs must cease," said Somerton,&#xD;
with energy.&#xD;
" And they will !" muttered the sword-&#xD;
maker,&#xD;
" Long live the king !" exclaimed Deborah&#xD;
Hadley.&#xD;
" Who'll take that masculine woman by the&#xD;
shoulders' and put her out doors ?" demanded&#xD;
Betsey Grindle, appealing to no one in par-&#xD;
ticular.&#xD;
" Yes, who'll do it ?" repeated Captain Deb.&#xD;
" What'sthat ?" cried Meg, suddenly.&#xD;
-   There was a pause. The distal t blast of a&#xD;
bugle was heard ; the mellow notes drifted&#xD;
into the open doors and windows like soft bil-&#xD;
, lows of harmony.&#xD;
t "I should know those sounds," said Som-&#xD;
erton.&#xD;
e "'Tis the blare of a trumpet ! said Mrs. Had-&#xD;
n ley, quickly. "A guinea to a shillin' that the&#xD;
i royal Americans are coming , with my son&#xD;
s Christian at their head. What think ye, old&#xD;
Hirl?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" I can't hear much, but jedgin' by wha&#xD;
little I can hear, I should say a company o&#xD;
hoss was coming' this way at a clean gallop,&#xD;
answered the hunchback, qietly. -&#xD;
"Be they friend or foe ?" interrogated Deb&#xD;
"I should think they might be one o&#xD;
tetherr !" screamed the swordmaker. "In the&#xD;
course o' natur' they must be for or ag'inst.'&#xD;
".Any fool knows that !" replied Mrs. Had-&#xD;
-   Icy, complimentarily.&#xD;
The bugle-notes grew louder and louder, and&#xD;
the heavy tramp of horsemen drew nearer&#xD;
Manifestly every person in the dwelling await&#xD;
ed the results with anxiety. The matter was&#xD;
. soon settled ; Rainford dashed up to the door&#xD;
at the head of his dragoons. Seeing Somer-&#xD;
ton at the window, he threw himself from the&#xD;
saddle, and hurried to greet him.&#xD;
" My dear colonel," he said, "I scarcely ex-&#xD;
pected this pleasure, although I have been in-&#xD;
formed of your escape from Hadley, and his&#xD;
ruffians, and of your being conveyed to Red-&#xD;
mond's plantation. I knew the house was&#xD;
burned, and feared the worst."&#xD;
" Providence has kept me alive, gallant&#xD;
Rainford, and I hope to ride again to battle&#xD;
by your side. How is it? Are our poor fel-&#xD;
lows cut to pieces? Have the dragoons lost&#xD;
heart and courage ?"&#xD;
"They have been roughly used, and are&#xD;
terribly harried with fighting overpowering&#xD;
numbers. But -the stout lads are good for&#xD;
another day. A few hours' rest and a hearty&#xD;
meal, will put most of them right ; but' some&#xD;
of them are done with eating. Well, that's a&#xD;
soldier's fate, Somerton. Whom hve you&#xD;
here? Ahi! I see bright eyes, and others that&#xD;
are not so bright. What is that masculine&#xD;
creature in the black coat and red petticoat?&#xD;
She looks like the devil's dam."&#xD;
"And such she is ; she is the mother of&#xD;
Christian Hadley," replied the colonel.&#xD;
" Infamy enough for one woman. I see a&#xD;
face that I know-that sharp'female, Betsey&#xD;
Grindle. But who are those pretty creatures&#xD;
who look as much alike as two peas in the&#xD;
same pod ?" '&#xD;
" The Redmond sisters," answered Somer-&#xD;
ton, glancing at the twain with evident pride.&#xD;
" The Redmond sisters," repeated Rainford,&#xD;
- , musingly. " My gallant colonel, I shall watch&#xD;
you ! With such fair nurses, I fear your'&#xD;
wounds will not heal by the first intention, as&#xD;
surgeons say. Well, Love and Glory are yoke-&#xD;
fellows."&#xD;
"'A rough soldier has little time for senti-&#xD;
ment at such a crisis as this," replied Somer-&#xD;
ton, coloring.&#xD;
" Time ? you've taken it by the forelock, ere&#xD;
this ; if you haven't, you've neglected your&#xD;
. opportunity ; that's all I can say. Here's the'&#xD;
swordmaker, too. A queer old body is the&#xD;
swordmaker I By-the-way, I have rare news&#xD;
&#xD;
Dj&#xD;
&#xD;
t for you: Marion's brigade is thundering up&#xD;
f from the swamps of the Santee. We'll drive&#xD;
Tarleton into the river, and send him back with&#xD;
banners trailed in the dust. This is not all ;&#xD;
as I came up I saw a man running across a&#xD;
r field. I put spurs to my horse, leaped fences,&#xD;
e ditches, and gates, ana finally'captured him.&#xD;
" Whom do you think it was? It was our old&#xD;
- friend, the spy."&#xD;
",The'spy !" said the colonel, with a start.&#xD;
" The spy !" repeated Hirl, in a voice more&#xD;
indicative of consternation than surprise.&#xD;
"The spy.!" gasped Judith.&#xD;
s " The same," replied Rainford. " And you&#xD;
r may rest assured," he added; significantly,&#xD;
"that he'll never be caught again."&#xD;
" Have you murdered him ?" asked the&#xD;
swordmaker, huskily.&#xD;
- " A continental soldier, old man, never com-&#xD;
mits murder," retorted Rainford, haughtily.&#xD;
" Tell me, oh tell me, sir-have you-have&#xD;
you-" began Judith, with strange vehe-&#xD;
mence.&#xD;
" Lady," answered Rainford, "be lives.&#xD;
Giles-sergeant Giles, bring forward the pris-&#xD;
oner."&#xD;
The word was passed along ; and after some&#xD;
commotion among the dragoons, Giles and&#xD;
Thornton appeared, leading the unfortunate&#xD;
Deering, whose arms were pinioned tightly.&#xD;
His face was calm, pale, and melancholy. He&#xD;
did not notice Judith, but a shudder passed&#xD;
over his person when he saw the swordmaker.&#xD;
For an instant he was affected, but presently&#xD;
confronted Raiaford and Somerton with self-&#xD;
possession.&#xD;
" Rash, misguided man !" exclaimed Somer-&#xD;
ton, sorrowfully. "I had hoped that we should&#xD;
never meet again, and that the past had&#xD;
taught you wisdom. You have tempted Prov-&#xD;
idence one- time too many ; nothing can save&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" Of what am I accused?" demanded the&#xD;
man, with an unflinching eye.&#xD;
Judith looked anxiously from one to the&#xD;
other of the two men.&#xD;
"Every child on the Santee could tell you&#xD;
your crime. The name of Guy Deering is too&#xD;
well known," returned the colonel.&#xD;
" My name is Henderson-Max Henderson."&#xD;
" The same subterfuge and falsehood!"&#xD;
cried Rainford, contemptuously.&#xD;
" It is my duty to assure you that this will&#xD;
not avail you," added Somerton, with firmness.&#xD;
"I have not the slightest hope that it will,"&#xD;
re lied the spy.&#xD;
The swordmaker stood watching the latter,&#xD;
and Judith ; his countenance. expressive of the&#xD;
deepest interests&#xD;
" Ah my boy, my poor boy, why didn't you&#xD;
keep out o' their elutches arter you left the.&#xD;
cabin ?" exclaimed Deborah Hadley, with evi-&#xD;
dent sorrow.&#xD;

THIE SWORDMAKER OF THE SANTEE;&#xD;
&#xD;
"Do you hear that, your honor? She ac-&#xD;
knowledges that he was at her cabin, to which&#xD;
I can swear ; for I saw him there, and should&#xD;
have taken him, if the chaplain and I hadn't&#xD;
been carcumvented by that she tory. I can&#xD;
testify, too, that she called him Guy Deerin'&#xD;
more nor once. Lord, Colonel! we can swear&#xD;
his life away in no time," interposed Giles,&#xD;
with much zeal.&#xD;
" Woni-in," said the spy, looking steadily at&#xD;
mother Hadley ; " I have entered no cabin of&#xD;
yours in the lat twelve hours. I have been&#xD;
too busy to avail myself of the shelter of a&#xD;
roof."&#xD;
"Cool enough ! cool enough!!" said the ser-&#xD;
geant, with an incredulous shrug. "Don't&#xD;
know nothin' 'bout bemn' hid in the cellar, I&#xD;
s'poise, nor what happened there, norhow you&#xD;
got away at last ?"&#xD;
"I protest, gentlemen, that I am utterly&#xD;
ignorant Qf all this," answered the accused,&#xD;
impressively.&#xD;
" He knows no more about it than a child&#xD;
unborn ! As for being' at my cabin, that was&#xD;
mor n a week ago," asserted Deb, promptly.&#xD;
"This lad isn't no more like Guy Deerin' than&#xD;
a cheese is like the moon. His name is Hen-&#xD;
derson, and nothin' else. Dear me ! I know d&#xD;
the Ilendersons years ago, man and boy, wo-&#xD;
man and child."&#xD;
1Good mother," said the spy, calmly, "let&#xD;
us have nothing but the truth, for I am placed&#xD;
where the truth will serve me, as well as false-&#xD;
hood; and neither can avail me aught."&#xD;
-And it's the truth I've been tellin', which&#xD;
I'mallers ready to tell for friend or foe. Who&#xD;
can have the heart to bring sich a fine-lookin'&#xD;
man to the halter?  But men become despe-&#xD;
rately wicked when they forgit the king and&#xD;
run art'-r liberty, Mr. Washin'ton, Congress,&#xD;
and others."  -&#xD;
Deborah shook her head regretfully, and.&#xD;
sighed.&#xD;
The swordmaker advanced a step toward the&#xD;
accused, who said, quickly, in a deprecating&#xD;
voice:&#xD;
"Nay, old m'an, I conjure you not to speak !&#xD;
The few feeble words that you could say in&#xD;
my favor will not affect the fate that is reserved&#xD;
for me, in the smallest degree. Your testi-&#xD;
monymightinvolve another. For God's sake,&#xD;
be quiet!"&#xD;
Rainford and Somerton exchanged a few&#xD;
words in low tones. The former then gave an&#xD;
order in the same voice to an officer near him.&#xD;
Judith cast herself at the swordmaker's feet,&#xD;
and seizing his hand, cried :&#xD;
"Oh, sir, ifyou can say any thing in favor&#xD;
of this wretched man, I entreat you, by all that&#xD;
you love, to say it!"&#xD;
"What can I do, child ; what can I do ? I&#xD;
am neither Somerton, nor Rainford, nor Wash-&#xD;
ington," answered Hirl, mournfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Do you know this lady, sir ?" asked Som-&#xD;
erton, pointing to Judith, and fixing his re-&#xD;
gards steadily upon tlie spy.&#xD;
" I have reason to believe her to be Judith&#xD;
Redmond ; but never had the pleasure and&#xD;
honor of her acquaintance," he replied.&#xD;
Judith arose, and gave him a reproachful,&#xD;
sorrowful glance.&#xD;
" It is Judith," said the swordmaker, in a&#xD;
voice so changed that every one involuntarily&#xD;
looked at him.&#xD;
"I have heard much of her goodness. May&#xD;
God bless her!"&#xD;
Judith was bewildered. What did this&#xD;
mean?   Was it a generous concealment to&#xD;
save her name and fame ; or was it a justifiable&#xD;
subterfuge, resorted to to weigh in his favor&#xD;
by embarrassing the question of his identity."&#xD;
An officer approached Rainford and said,&#xD;
" We are ready, sir."&#xD;
" Ladies," said Somerton, "you had better&#xD;
retire into the house, and lose the doors.&#xD;
The further examination of the prisoner will&#xD;
be conducted more privately."&#xD;
" Such is not your purpose," said Judith,&#xD;
with empressement. "You have something&#xD;
terrible in view."&#xD;
" Mister," said the swordmaker, addressing&#xD;
the spy, " what might be the matter with your&#xD;
hands and arms? It 'pears like as though&#xD;
you'd passed through a furnace."&#xD;
Somerton heard the words,. and glanced at&#xD;
what he had not before observed-the hands&#xD;
and arms of the prisoner.    His manner&#xD;
changed in a moment ; he sprang toward&#xD;
Deering, saying :&#xD;
'," I conjure you to tell me how you received&#xD;
those injuries ?"&#xD;
The man's hands were blistered and char-&#xD;
red, and his coat and linen hung in scorched'&#xD;
threads from his arms.&#xD;
"Question me-not," replied Deering.&#xD;
"I insist !" continued Somerton, emphati-&#xD;
cally.&#xD;
"In rescuing two human beings from a&#xD;
burning building, I received these wounds&#xD;
from the angry flames," answered the spy, un-&#xD;
assumingly.&#xD;
"I knew it! I knew it!" exclaimed Somer-&#xD;
ton. "It was you who bore me from Red-&#xD;
mond's house-it was you who saved Miriam.&#xD;
I had an unaccountable apprehension of it at&#xD;
the time, although my bodily faculties were&#xD;
paralyzed by suffocating gases."&#xD;
" Captain Rainford, I am ready ! I thank&#xD;
you that this time it is not hanging," said the&#xD;
prisoner, with a faint smile.&#xD;
Sergeant Giles took him by the arm to lead&#xD;
him away. Some ten rods distant, a dozen&#xD;
dragoons could be seen in line, under arms.&#xD;
While Somerton stood deeply affected by this&#xD;
development, General Marion and two of his&#xD;
aides arrived at the scene. His coming was&#xD;

Rainford then proceeded to relate the cir-  " Consider-reflect! What will you-~what&#xD;

THE KNIGHT OF THE BLACA FLAG.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
"He was the mildest mannered man&#xD;
That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat ;&#xD;
With suchtrue breeding of a gentleman,&#xD;
You never could divine his ieal thought."&#xD;
-BmroN.&#xD;
" Yes, noble lady, I am dreaming-dream-&#xD;
ing of the day when I shall wear the spurs of&#xD;
knighthood, be kind to my inferiors, courteous&#xD;
to my equals, and acknowledge no superior of&#xD;
my own sex but my God and the king !"&#xD;
The spot where these words were spoken&#xD;
was in a wildly beautiful valley in Wales, a&#xD;
rocky, wooded dell, which lay beneath the&#xD;
walls of an ancient castle, wh'se lofty grey&#xD;
towers and rough battlements gave token of&#xD;
its power, well garrisoned,-to 'withstand the&#xD;
siege of an army. And it had withstood more&#xD;
than one siege ; for its lordly gwnor, the Earl of&#xD;
Caermarthen, had been true to Charles the&#xD;
Martyr, scorning Cromwell and his bloody&#xD;
protectorate, and now gloried in the favor of&#xD;
the reigning monarch, Charles the Second.&#xD;
The castle stood high among the craggy&#xD;
cliffs which border the western coast of&#xD;
Wales ; so near the sea that the roar of the&#xD;
. ocean surges could be heard in its halls, when-&#xD;
ever the spirit of the storm awoke them from&#xD;
their slumbers. And down from amid those&#xD;
crags, crossing the winding pathway to the&#xD;
castle, where a rude bridge spanned it, rushed&#xD;
the main fountain of the Towy river on its&#xD;
foamy way to Cardigan Bay.&#xD;
The speaker was a young -man, not far past&#xD;
his twentieth year, in the flower of strength&#xD;
and manly beauty. His fine form was plainly&#xD;
but neatly clad in a fashion which indicated&#xD;
his vocation to be a military one. A sword&#xD;
rested in its scabbard on his thigh, and a dag-&#xD;
ger was in his belt. A peaked hat with a&#xD;
broad brim shaded his white forehead, over&#xD;
&#xD;
which drooped a single ostrich ferither, as black&#xD;
as night. ,From beneath this hat, his hair de-&#xD;
scended-in glossy brown curls down upon 'his&#xD;
shoulders, in true '.'cavalier" style, and the&#xD;
lower pa   of his"finely-featured blonde face&#xD;
was co ered with a . soft. and curling - beard,&#xD;
which had neyer known the desecrating touch&#xD;
of the razor or scissors; the one a most&#xD;
barber-ous, aiid'the other, a most .treacherous&#xD;
and Delilah-ian weapon.&#xD;
That the young man wore arms, in that time,&#xD;
was sufficient toprove that he either was of&#xD;
gentle blood, or else in the service of one of&#xD;
the nobility.  His manner to the lady, whose&#xD;
questioning had elicited the words which oc-&#xD;
cur at the opening of this story, was humble&#xD;
and deeply respectful ; but yet he permitted&#xD;
his blue eyes unabashed to gaze upon her&#xD;
truly glorious beauty ; and though the color&#xD;
came and went upon his face like the blushes&#xD;
of a bashful maiden, there was no tremor in&#xD;
his voice when he replied to her. She had&#xD;
ridden up to .iim, followed by two attendants&#xD;
of her own sex, while he stood leaning against&#xD;
an oak by the side of the rushing stream,&#xD;
in so deep a reverie that he had not heard her&#xD;
approach.&#xD;
I said she was very beautiful. Nor did I&#xD;
err. Her noble bust was well displayed, as she&#xD;
sat upon an Arabian courser of snowy white ;&#xD;
and though a look of cold and haughty pride&#xD;
somewhat marbleized her perfect features, an&#xD;
illuminating smile so softened them, when she&#xD;
spoke to the young man, that to him she look-&#xD;
ed like an angel.&#xD;
" Thy aspirations are lofty, Master Henry,"&#xD;
said she, with a smile at his words.&#xD;
" Very, lady ! so lofty that few ears will hear&#xD;
me utter them. Excuse my folly in speaking&#xD;
of them."&#xD;
"Nay, I did not say it was folly, Master&#xD;
Henry," said the lady, quickly, for he seemed&#xD;
