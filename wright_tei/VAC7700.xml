ALTHOUGH of much importance as a manufact-&#xD;
uring place, Belton is noted chiefly for the beau-&#xD;
tiful water-fall to which the town, in fact, owes&#xD;
its existence.&#xD;
Here the Passaic, interrupted in its placid&#xD;
flow by a rocky barrier, takes an abrupt turn,&#xD;
and plunges in a narrow sheet of foam adown&#xD;
a deep chasm, formed in one of nature's throes&#xD;
ages ago, and then with wild swirls rushes an&#xD;
grily over a rocky bed, until spent and quiet it&#xD;
skirts the town, and winds away appeased and&#xD;
.pellucid-despite the murky drain of dye-houses&#xD;
-through woodlands, fields, and pastures green.&#xD;
Ere reaching the cataract, however, the river is&#xD;
tapped by a canal which serves to feed the flumes&#xD;
that run the many mills of Belton ; and through&#xD;

this race-way the diverted waters speed on their&#xD;
busy errand, starting cumkersome overshot, un-&#xD;
dershot, breast, and turbine wheels into .action,&#xD;
that in their turn quicken into life the restless&#xD;
shuttle and whirling spindle.&#xD;
From the cliff, at the head-of the cataract, one&#xD;
may completely overlook the town, a cheerful&#xD;
hive, compactly built, and consisting chiefly of&#xD;
long brick factories, with little belfries, and&#xD;
rows of small white wooden dwellings.     The&#xD;
whole; is neat and bright; no canopy of coal-&#xD;
smoke obscures the blue sky, and but an occa-&#xD;
sional tall chimney or jet of vapor is seen, for&#xD;
here steam is dethroned, and the cheaper motor&#xD;
reigns supreme.&#xD;
The river side, the cliff, the falls, in short the,&#xD;
water-power belongs and has belonged for gen-&#xD;
erations to the Obershaw family.   In days of&#xD;
yore, when Whitman Obershaw ran a saw-mill,&#xD;
and tilled, a clearing hereabout, his worldly pos-&#xD;
sessions, it is safe to say, were notsuch as to as-&#xD;
similate his, chances of salvation to the facility&#xD;
with which a camel can go through a needle's&#xD;
eye, and it was reserved for his son, John Peter&#xD;
oG-,r haw, t reap the beneit of the accident&#xD;

that had put his ancestors in possession of the&#xD;
site of Belton. And when you consider the&#xD;
present magnitude of the place, its many mills,&#xD;
and the enormous yearly rental of the water-&#xD;
power, you will not be surprised to learn that the&#xD;
costly stone mansion on the cliff, with its impos-&#xD;
ing front, its beautiful grounds, conservatories,&#xD;
and lodges, is the residence of the Hon. Rufus&#xD;
Heath, son-in-law and heir of John Peter Ober-&#xD;
shaw, who built it.&#xD;
There is a mural tablet in the apse of St.&#xD;
Jude's, Belton, inscribed to the memory of,&#xD;

An epitaph which bore out the proverbial reputa-&#xD;
tion of its kind in being essentially a lie-.-a lie in&#xD;
black and white, for old Obershaw had no Chris-&#xD;

rather disliked- by all for a selfish, avaricious,.&#xD;

nonagenarian. Perhaps the only commendable&#xD;
act of his life was the erection of the small, but&#xD;
handsome church in question. Yet, even this&#xD;
was looked upon as but the placatory offering of&#xD;
a prudent worldling, about to appear before the&#xD;
final tribunal, and anxious to propitiate the&#xD;
great Judge. Moreover, those who knew the&#xD;
most about it asserted that the church would&#xD;
never have been built, nor. a dollar spent to-&#xD;
wards it, had it not been for Rufus Heath, who,&#xD;
during the last years of his father-in-law's life,&#xD;
had the entire control of the estate, owing to the&#xD;
latter's age and incapacity. Doubtless these as-&#xD;
sertions were true, for neither dread of God or&#xD;
demon could ever have wrung an unremunera-&#xD;
tive stiver from old John Peter Obershaw's&#xD;
clutching fist, as he belonged to the orthodox&#xD;
school of misers-the class who live but to accu-&#xD;
mulate, and find all their pleasure in that sound,&#xD;
wholesome vice which prolongs life, and betrays&#xD;
not to a fool's paradise.&#xD;
To the last he was steadfast to his idol. For&#xD;
years previous he was confined to his room by pa-&#xD;
ralysis, dead to all affections save love of money,&#xD;
and vegetating in an easy chair stuffed literally&#xD;
&#xD;
with gold; for the senile miser, like a' mag-&#xD;
pie, slyly secreted coin in every nook and corner&#xD;
of his chamber. In this second childhood, it was&#xD;
necessary to quiet him by giving him money to&#xD;
toy with, and musty accounts and deeds, which&#xD;
he pored over with the vacuity of an imbecile.&#xD;
To the end the ruling passion swayed him. At the&#xD;
last moment, when the taper of life was about&#xD;
giving its expiring flicker, he asked his attend-&#xD;
ant to bring him a surveyor's map of his es-&#xD;
tate. "And, James, tell . . tell Mr. Heath I&#xD;
want to see him . . . see him at once. Must&#xD;
buy Van Slyke's farm if he'll sell it right ..&#xD;
sell it right. But he wants too much . . . too&#xD;
much. No.. no., can't give it. No6. .  o.&#xD;
haven't . . got the money. Soon as I am well&#xD;
well . . and strong, I'll go out and have a look&#xD;
at it . . . look at it. Soon as I am well, and go&#xD;
out . . . go out. But can't 'ford to pay much.&#xD;
No . no. Van Slyke's farm '11 square the addi-&#xD;
tion. But, I can't pay much . . . can't 'ford it;"&#xD;
and a nervous twitching of his pale thin lips, as&#xD;
he mumbled to himself, showed teeth still sound,&#xD;
though worn down like an old mastiff's. lie was&#xD;
a man of large frame, gaunt, bowed with age,&#xD;

&#xD;
and the dried yellow skin of his face resem-&#xD;
bled wrinkled parchment. When the map was&#xD;
brought to him, he stared vacantly at it with&#xD;
faded eyes that looked like dull agates, then re-&#xD;
lapsed into a still slumber with the map griped&#xD;
in his long, talon-like, bony fingers, as if some&#xD;
one would steal it from him. Aroused by the&#xD;
entrance of his son-in-law, he again mumbled-&#xD;
" Where's the map . . . map 2 Heath, see Van&#xD;
Slyke 'bout the farm and don't let him . .  let&#xD;
him cheat me. I ain't quite . . . quite so strong&#xD;
now, and . . .and they'll cheat me. Ah, they're.&#xD;
a close, sharp set. . . . Soon as I am well I'll&#xD;
go . . . I'll go..&#xD;
The last words were uttered in a faint whisper ;&#xD;
no further sound came from the moving lips;&#xD;
the death film crept over his eyes, and rhe was&#xD;
gone. He had lasted well and long, for avarice&#xD;
is a powerful antiseptic. The dry heart burns to&#xD;
the socket, and the selfish miser was blessed with&#xD;
an euthanasia that a saint might have envied.&#xD;
The nearest physician, Dr. Wattletop, was&#xD;
swiftly summoned, only to return discomfited, as&#xD;
he expressed it, by that omnipotent leech who&#xD;
carries his lancet at the end of a snath.&#xD;
&#xD;
The fall of so heavily laden a body into the&#xD;
great ocean of eternity created, to use a homely&#xD;
simile, an unusual splash, and occasioned no little&#xD;
commotion in Belton.&#xD;
" Why, sir," said Mr. Madison Mumbie, the&#xD;
eminent paper-maker, addressing Dr. Wattletop,&#xD;
in the agitation of the moment, "Why, sir, Mr.&#xD;
Obershaw's wealth is e-normous! Probably the&#xD;
richest man we had in the State. Yes, sir "(with&#xD;
a sigh), "I regret to say it, we have lost a gentle.&#xD;
man, and a Christian, who leaves at least two&#xD;
millions of dollars. Yes, sir, two millions at the&#xD;
lowest calculation-he leaves all of that!"&#xD;
"Leaves! "repeated the doctor. "Aye, there's&#xD;
the rub. Now, if he could only have taken the&#xD;
two millions with him, there would have been&#xD;
something in it, wouldn't there 2"&#xD;
This view of the case did not strike Mr. Mum-&#xD;
bie, who was himself rather inclined to accumu-&#xD;
late, as cheerful or encouraging, and he went his&#xD;
way in a meditative mood.&#xD;
Mr. Mook, the gentlemanly undertaker, in&#xD;
walking twenty rods from the residence of athe&#xD;
deceased, was accosted by not less than a dozen&#xD;
&#xD;

anxious inquirers eager to learn the slightest par-&#xD;
ticular relating to the sorrowful event. To whom&#xD;
Mr. Mook, with that mingled air of neatness, de-&#xD;
spatch, and meek resignation to the decrees of&#xD;
Providence, which characterized him, replied&#xD;
in a serious and very proper way. The informa-&#xD;
tion imparted was invariably received by the&#xD;
questioners with expressions of deep interest and&#xD;
sympathy, as if they had lost a near and dear&#xD;
friend. It is sad to add, though, that one indb.&#xD;
vidual,George Gildersleeve, the noisiest quidnune&#xD;
in Belton, was on the contrary rather discourteous.&#xD;
and disparaging in his inquiries and comments.&#xD;
George is a man of substance, and proprietor of&#xD;
the Archimedes Works. A burly fellow of mid-&#xD;
die age, with chest and loins like an ox, coarse&#xD;
mouth, hale complexion, end sandy hair shorn&#xD;
close over an obstinate head. Rich. and purse-&#xD;
proud, he. proclaims himself a plebeian, and in&#xD;
keeping therewith is generally seen divested ofi&#xD;
coat and hands in pockets. Thus he appeared in&#xD;
the doorway of his counting-room as Mr. Mook&#xD;
came.down the street, and passed the Archimedes&#xD;
Works. Decorous and. mournful Nook affected&#xD;
not to. see Gildersleeve, dreading him. as a bore&#xD;

and button-holder ; but the stfratagem was futile,&#xD;
and bluff George, hailing the undertaker as&#xD;
"Commodore," brought him-speaking nautically&#xD;
"First-class obsequies, sir, have been ordered,&#xD;
Most elegant rosewood casket, new pattern silver&#xD;
handles. Everything in the most rekerchey and&#xD;
approved style. Funeral on Wednesday," Mook&#xD;
replied, in a tone of mild reproof, in answer to&#xD;
Gildersleeve's query as to when he was going to&#xD;
put old Uncle John to bed with a shovel.&#xD;
Mr. Mook 'took pride in his profession. He&#xD;
was the inventor and patentee of a burial casket,&#xD;
that for "ease, elegance, and comfort," as he ad-&#xD;
miringly described it, was equalled by few and&#xD;
surpassed by none.&#xD;
" Well, well, Co'nzodore "-it was a habit of&#xD;
Gildersleeve's to d\ib his friends and acquaint-&#xD;
ances with incongruous titles, whether prompted&#xD;
thereto by affectionate impulses or a peculiar&#xD;
sense of humor, we are not prepared to decide;&#xD;
sufficient to say that the undertaker was invari-&#xD;
ably addressed as "Commodore " by the master of&#xD;
the Archimedes Works ; similarly, Mr. McGof-&#xD;

maker, was styled "Judge;" Dr. Wattletop,&#xD;
"Major," etc., etc.&#xD;
"Well, well, Commodore," said Gildersleeve,&#xD;
leaving his door-step and planting himself on the&#xD;
sidewalk so as to bar the way and hold the under-&#xD;
taker to converse, "so we go. If the man with&#xD;
the pitchfork don't get old Uncle John, what the&#xD;
deuce is the use of having a man with a pitch-&#xD;
fork, eh ?"&#xD;
Mr. Mook coughed behind his hand, and tried&#xD;
to look as if he hadn't heard the remark, as he&#xD;
said, "Great loss to Belton, Mr. Gildersleeve."&#xD;
"Great loss!" repeated Gildersleeve. "The&#xD;
old cuss! Why, confound him, he drove his only&#xD;
son, Johnny Obershaw, to sea when he was but&#xD;
fourteen years old, by his infernal meanness, and&#xD;
the little monkey was lost .overboard less than a&#xD;
month after; and now here's Rufe Heath, that I&#xD;

the hokey! on this spot (with a flourish towards&#xD;
the works), where my grandfather shod Gineral&#xD;
Washington's horse in a rickety old shanty that&#xD;
you could have capsized with a kick, I began&#xD;
when I was knee-high, with a hide apron on,&#xD;
swinging the sledge and paring hoofs late and&#xD;
early. Yes, sir ! late and early, warm or cold, I&#xD;
stuck to it, and no thanks to any one, until you&#xD;
see what I've come to! And is there any airs&#xD;
about me? I think not; and there's many a man&#xD;
in this place that's as proud as a peacock, that I&#xD;
could buy and sell twice over. But I can say&#xD;
this, and you know it, that I've always been, and&#xD;
always intend to be, as independent as a hog on&#xD;
ice. That's me!"&#xD;
And that was he. For if Mr. George Wash-&#xD;
ington Gildersleeve prided himself on anything,&#xD;
it was on being free from "airs," and indepen-&#xD;
dent as a hog on ice-a comparison, it must be&#xD;
confessed, not particularly happy, and that con-&#xD;
veyed an entirely unintended impression. How-&#xD;
ever, it caine pat to him, and he flung it defiantly&#xD;
in the teeth of the world. Mook had heard those&#xD;
sentiments before, hence he was not vividly im-&#xD;
pressed by them, nor altogether pleased with the&#xD;

diatribe against his present patrons. Still, he was&#xD;
not prepared for their sakes to remonstrate, and&#xD;
perhaps offend a future customer, for the under-&#xD;
taker, "thankful for past favors," as he stated in&#xD;
his advertisement in the Belton Sentinel, "and&#xD;
soliciting a continuance of the same," seemed to&#xD;
think himself exempt from the common lot of&#xD;
humanity, and set apart to take under all Belton&#xD;
forever. So he gave a non-committal shake of&#xD;
the head, as he contemplated the pavement, and&#xD;
then, profiting by a pause in Gildersleeve's ha-&#xD;
rangue to escape, glided with soft steps away to&#xD;
his avocations.&#xD;
The funeral was an imposing one. Many of&#xD;
the mills were closed-all, in fact, that could con-&#xD;
veniently stop working. The Archimedes Works,&#xD;
though, remained in full blast, as the proprietor,&#xD;
true to his independence, did not feel himself any&#xD;
more called upon to close his shops for old John&#xD;
Peter Obershaw's death, than for that of any&#xD;
other mere acquaintance. Gildersleeve, however,&#xD;
as a concession, was at the interment, with his&#xD;
coat on too, somewhat subdued, perhaps, in tone&#xD;
and demeanor, but keeping up, nevertheless, an.&#xD;
&#xD;
animated political discussion with a fellow-citizen&#xD;
as they stood in the churchyard. Nine-tenths of&#xD;
the population of the town gathered to witness&#xD;
the funeral. There had not been so much excite-&#xD;
ment in the place since the day of the "Grand&#xD;
Triumphal Entree" of "Peabody's Combination&#xD;
Menagerie and Hippodrome."  The people lined&#xD;
the streets through which the procession passed,&#xD;
and filled St. Jude's, where the services were held.&#xD;
No less than three ministers were in attendance,&#xD;
and a bishop extolled the virtues and success of&#xD;
the decedent in a way to persuade the auditors&#xD;
that they mourned a well-spent life. Then the&#xD;
church bell tolled a requiem knell as to the family&#xD;
vault the corpse was borne along, attended by&#xD;
pall-bearers, who had been consistently selected&#xD;
from among the wealthiest acquaintances of the'&#xD;
family. The Hon. Rufus Heath followed as chief&#xD;
mourner, with his young daughter; then came&#xD;
his son and daughter-in-law; and lastly, a. multi-&#xD;
tude of relatives and friends.&#xD;
So passed away this old man, leaving behind a&#xD;
vast fortune, that had brought him but the gain-&#xD;
bler's joy-but the arid pleasures of the gold.&#xD;

odorless fumes whose cold astringency withers the&#xD;
emotions, dries the heart, and leaves man with&#xD;
but the instincts of the vulture and fox.&#xD;
John Peter Obershaw left no children to sur-&#xD;
vive him. His only son, as Gildersleeve had said,&#xD;
was lost at sea, and his daughter, Mrs. Heath, had&#xD;
preceded her father on the long journey years&#xD;
before. As he owed much of the augmentation&#xD;
of his wealth to the judgment, vigilance, and&#xD;
superintendence of his son-in-law, it was not sur-&#xD;
prising that the estate was found devised to him,&#xD;
the only being who had ever secured the favor&#xD;
and entire confidence of the .old miser. Town&#xD;
tattle hinted at."undue influence" and "imbecil-&#xD;
ity." There might have been more in this than&#xD;
idle gossip, but as no one was interested other&#xD;
than the devisee's children, in making any investi-&#xD;
gations, he inherited without opposition.. A great&#xD;
accretion of wealth this to .Rufus Heath, who&#xD;
stepped thus quietly into the shoes of the late&#xD;
owner of Belton, for that town was in reality&#xD;
little more than an appanage of the Obershaw&#xD;
fantily.  The evidences of this were patent on&#xD;

THE villa on the cliff would probably have&#xD;
excited but little attention in any country where&#xD;
chateaux or palaces abound, but it was looked&#xD;
upon by the simple people of Belton as a magnif-&#xD;
icent dwelling. After a stranger or tourist had&#xD;
seen the falls, he was invariably driven by the&#xD;
ciceroning hackman, desirous of lengthening the&#xD;
ride and increasing the fare, to view Mr. Heath's&#xD;
residence, that being considered next in impor~&#xD;
tance as a noteworthy object. It was built of a&#xD;
gray stone, on a site that commanded a fine pros-&#xD;
pect of the town and of a long stretch of river.&#xD;
There was no attempt to preserve architectural&#xD;
unity in the structure; in fact, it exhibited rather&#xD;
an incongruous medley of orders. The front was&#xD;
partly Italian, with a circular portico supported&#xD;
by slender Ionic columns. The rear was Eliza-&#xD;
bethan, pieced out with an extension for a pict-&#xD;
ure-gallery; on one side were oriel windows, and&#xD;
the other was flanked by a keep, with turret and&#xD;
&#xD;
embattled parapet, which gave the edifice rather&#xD;
a frowning appearance, as if the host were pre-&#xD;
pared for any emergency, and could treat visitors&#xD;
with bountiful hospitality, or a narrow cell in the&#xD;
donjon, as he saw fit and felt disposed. The inte.&#xD;
rior was in keeping with this pretentious exterior.&#xD;
A stately staircase led up from a wide entrance&#xD;
hall tessellated with marble tiles, on either side&#xD;
of which were dining and reception rooms. These&#xD;
and the boudoirs and bedchambers were all re-&#xD;
splendent with gilt and elegant frescoes, The&#xD;
surrounding -grounds, or "park," as they were&#xD;
called, were spacious. There were terraces with&#xD;
marble urns, fountains, velvet lawns, interspersed&#xD;
with brilliant beds of flowers, and rows of shapely&#xD;
evergreens. In short, no expense had been spared&#xD;
to construct a habitation capable of impressing an&#xD;
ordinary beholder with the wealth and impor-&#xD;
tance of the dwellers therein, and if corroborative&#xD;
evidence were needed; the porter at the lodge&#xD;
would carry conviction by referring to the elegant&#xD;
iron railing inclosing the grounds, which he as-&#xD;
serted, with emphatic pride, "cost more'n twenty&#xD;
thousand hard, ringing silver dollars! A fortune&#xD;
for any one."&#xD;

&#xD;
Do not suppose that old John Peter Obershaw&#xD;
was in any way responsible for all this pomp and&#xD;
splendor. Spending money, much less extrava-&#xD;
gance in any shape, was totally foreign to his&#xD;
habits or tastes; and he had been led into the&#xD;
outlay requisite for all this grandeur insensibly&#xD;
and unwittingly. We say insensibly and unwit-&#xD;
tingly the more positively, as the aged invalid&#xD;
could not be said to have had any sense or wit of&#xD;
his own, during the last years of his long life, and&#xD;
was completely under the dominion of his son-in-&#xD;
law, who planned and built the villa in accord-&#xD;
ance with his own ostentatious ideas.&#xD;
The morning after the late owner of this prince-&#xD;
ly residence had left it for the narrow quarters of&#xD;
a churchyard vault, the new one arose early and&#xD;
descended from his bedroom for a short walk in&#xD;
the fresh morning air. A very handsome man of&#xD;
fifty or so, with a compact figure, keen gray eyes,&#xD;
high receding forehead, slightly bald, and hair&#xD;
prematurely silvered.  Perceptible on the firm&#xD;
surface of his pale, close-shorn face, were the&#xD;
lines of decision and shrewdness, and that seal of&#xD;
pride conferred by the possession of wealth and&#xD;
authority-a chilling expression commonly called&#xD;
&#xD;
aristocratic, and which is simply refined vanity.&#xD;
Musing with downcast eyes, hands clasped behind&#xD;
his back, and head uncovered, to and fro on the&#xD;
terrace paced Mr. Heath. Before descending,&#xD;
he had opened the door of his father-in-law's&#xD;
room, and looked in. The huge stuffed arm-chair&#xD;
was still there in its accustomed place, but vacant;&#xD;
the padding ripped up-done to look for secreted&#xD;
coin. His staff lay in one corner, a worn hickory&#xD;
stick, his companion for years,-but the old man&#xD;
was gone. He had been for years but an inert&#xD;
dweller, verging on imbecility, an incumbrance,&#xD;
and yet what a void he had left! fHow silent&#xD;
and empty the chamber seemed ! Mr. Heath&#xD;
closed the door softly, and went gravely down&#xD;
the stairs. He was glad to breathe the refresh-&#xD;
ing air and feel the sunshine. As he paced, he&#xD;
would occasionally stop and glance over the&#xD;
sloping lawn, and towards the river whose shin-&#xD;
mng current bore thrift to the town and tribute to&#xD;
him. All these possessions were now his, abso-&#xD;
lutely and entirely his. Without longing for it,&#xD;
he had expected and looked forward to this day.&#xD;
He remembered, when a poor clerk, how he had&#xD;
coveted the wealth of the proprietor of Belton&#xD;
&#xD;

Falls, as he watched him, meanly clad, haggling.&#xD;
with some  shopkeeper over a few coppers. He&#xD;
remembered his joy when a stroke of luck put&#xD;
him in possession of the capital necessary to&#xD;
carry out a scheme whose consummation had en-&#xD;
abled him finally to attain his present position,&#xD;
first, by securing Mr. Obershaw's confidence, and&#xD;
eventually, a less difficult feat (favored as he waft&#xD;
by an uncommon share of good looks), the hand&#xD;
and heart of his daughter. And now they were&#xD;
both gone, and he was left loaded with wealth;&#xD;
wealth unmeasured-wealth to flatter every wish&#xD;
and further every ambitious project. The fruit&#xD;
was ripe and had fallen. He bit it, but no lus-&#xD;
cious juice rushed to the bare papillae; the taste&#xD;
was insipid and dry as ashes ! Every realization&#xD;
is but an after-taste, but this was almost bitter.&#xD;
The morning sun spangled the dewy grass; and&#xD;
darted brightly through the tree boughs. Birds,&#xD;
carolled sweetly, and all nature rejoiced, but his&#xD;
spirits seemed to sink under the increased weight&#xD;
of riches, and he felt burdened. For an instant&#xD;
an unaccountable depression seized him, and he&#xD;
hardly heeded a gardener who approached to&#xD;
speak. The man noticed his master's pre-occu-&#xD;
&#xD;
pation, and waited patiently and respectfully un-&#xD;
til his attention was drawn towards him. He&#xD;
wanted to know if Mr. Heath would like to look&#xD;
at a beautiful exotic that had just bloomed that&#xD;
morning. MI'. Heath mechanically assented, and&#xD;
followed the gardener to the greenhouse. Usu-&#xD;
ally he was imuch interested in the fine collection&#xD;
of plants in the conservatory, but now he listened&#xD;
dully to the man's enthusiastic praises of the rare&#xD;
flower, and looked at it with indifference. With-&#xD;
out replying to the gardener. he -walked away&#xD;
slowly, musing as he went on that sermon so&#xD;
often repeated but never heeded-the vanity of&#xD;
earthly possessions. "Dross, dross, it is so," he&#xD;
soliloquized, "but how long it takes to learn the&#xD;
lesson! IHow many envy me ; how many whose&#xD;
first thought on seeing me, whose first wish, is to&#xD;
be as I am! What a supremely happy and bless-&#xD;
ed man I must be! Ah, the monks are wise.. .&#xD;
But fame-the incense of popular applause-a&#xD;
name to live in future generations; something&#xD;
that the grave cannot extinguish, and death take&#xD;
away, that is the goal to strive for! Aye, ambi-&#xD;
tion is the only passion worthy a master mind."&#xD;
He re-entered the house and went to his library.&#xD;

The sight of his accustomed work-room seemed&#xD;
to banish the shadow on his countenance. " Bless-&#xD;
ed-blessed labor, what a balm thou art ! " he&#xD;
apostrophized as with a sort of eagerness he&#xD;
threw himself in a chair, seized a pen, and fol-&#xD;
lowed a new train of ideas.&#xD;
A singular fit of despondency this in one bask-&#xD;
ing in the smiles of Fortune, and who had so&#xD;
steadily enjoyed her favors; for the capricious&#xD;
dame had marked Rufus Heath for a' favorite&#xD;
long ago by a significafit gift plainly indicative&#xD;
of her partiality. This gift, or stroke of luck,&#xD;
was the winning at his start in life of a lottery&#xD;
prize, which sudden afluence, judiciously in-&#xD;
vested, had led to the splendid culmination now&#xD;
apparent.&#xD;
Mr. Heath was in his library, a large room ad-&#xD;
joining his bedchamber, which also answered the&#xD;
purposes of a study, and was furnished with leath-&#xD;
ern-covered chairs, and surrounded by closely-&#xD;
tilled book-cases of polished walnut, surmounted&#xD;
at intervals with marble busts of the-giants of in-&#xD;
tellect. A long table in the centre of the room&#xD;
was covered with maps, manuscripts, and works of&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
reference. At one end Mr. Heath sat intently&#xD;
writing. His early habits of industry he still&#xD;
carried almost to excess. Idleness filched but few&#xD;
moments from him, and by a thorough system he&#xD;
managed to perform an amount of labor that&#xD;
would have been deemed prodigious in a close&#xD;
student. The work that engrossed the most of&#xD;
his time, the opus magnus, was the preparation of&#xD;
a pandect wherein the constitutions, statutes, and&#xD;
enactments of the various States of the Union&#xD;
would be digested and reconciled into ont har-&#xD;
monious code of laws. The mere gathering and&#xD;
collating of material for this purpose involved a&#xD;
formidable amount of labor, and when in addi-&#xD;
tion to this we consider that he supervised the&#xD;
accounts of the estate and kept up a voluminous&#xD;
correspondence with statesmen and politicians in&#xD;
all parts of the country, we may imagine that he&#xD;
had but few spare moments.&#xD;
Behind him on the wall hung the symbol of his&#xD;
weakness-an illuminated achievement intended&#xD;
to represent the arms of the Heath family.&#xD;
Should a visitor's attention be attracted by this&#xD;
heraldic device, the host was only too happy to ex-&#xD;
plain the mystery of crest and quarterings, and&#xD;

to dilate on his lineage, tracing its common origin&#xD;
with that of a distinguished English ducal family.&#xD;
For Rufus Heath, in his heart of hearts, despised&#xD;
republic and had no faith in the stability of its&#xD;
institutions. His ideal of a government was an&#xD;
oligarchy, with him  and his .like as oligarchs.&#xD;
Outwardly he professed the stanchest republican-&#xD;
ism and devotion to equal' rights.&#xD;
So absorbed had Mr. Death become in his oc-&#xD;
cupation that he heeded not his daughter as she&#xD;
came to ask him to breakfast. She entered the&#xD;
study softly, and almost timidly, for she held disturb&#xD;
father in a certain awe and deedtdiur&#xD;
him. It was only when she laid her hand lightly&#xD;
on his shoulder that he discovered her presence.&#xD;
"Father, good-morning," said she, seeking'to&#xD;
press her lips to his cheek.&#xD;
" Ah Miss Edna. Is that you?" he replied,&#xD;
impassively, and slowly disengaging her arm from&#xD;
his neck. "Good-morning. Leave me, chid;&#xD;
I will be with you in an instant."&#xD;
There was no unkindness in the tone, but there&#xD;
was no warmth. The few words that had passed&#xD;
between them revealed enough to indicate to an&#xD;
observant witness the history of a daughter's&#xD;
&#xD;
heart, eager .for tl affection of a parent insulat-&#xD;
ed from domestic ties by egotistic worldliness.&#xD;
Mr. heath laid aside his pen, passed to his&#xD;
chamber, and arranged his toilet preparatory to&#xD;
the morning repast. He then descended the&#xD;
stairs as if a chamberlain preceded him ; entered&#xD;
the breakfast-room with a stately nod to those&#xD;
present, and took his seat at the table gravely,&#xD;
and with an apology for his tardiness. After&#xD;
a scrutinizing glance around, a preparatory pause&#xD;
followed, and then, bending low his head, he in-&#xD;
yoked the Divine blessing. The meals in that&#xD;
family were not at any time those cheerful family&#xD;
gatherings that diversify existence so pleasantly,&#xD;
but serious proceedings, conducted with severe&#xD;
propriety, the head of the house being exceed-&#xD;
ingly punctilious on that score. On this morn-&#xD;
ing, naturally enough, a greater solemnity pre-&#xD;
vailed, and the breakfast was passed almost in&#xD;
silence. Mrs. Applegate, a widow, and elder sis-&#xD;
ter of Mr. Heath, presided. She had been in-&#xD;
stalled housekeeper on the death of her brother's&#xD;
wife, and occupied the post at table that should&#xD;
have devolved upon young Mrs. Heath, but that&#xD;
lady was too indifferent, and disinclined to any&#xD;

exertion to fill it. She was a Creole by birth, the&#xD;
daughter of a Yankee machinist who had mar-&#xD;
ried the very wealthy widow of a Cuban planter.&#xD;
This machinist, Sam Wolvern, previous to going&#xD;
to the West Indies, had learned his trade in Bel-&#xD;
ton, and after the death of his wife returned&#xD;
there to live. Dying soon after-his arrival, he&#xD;
left Mr. Heath sole guardian of the person and&#xD;
fortune of his only child, Mercedita Wolvern.&#xD;
So well did the guardian manage his trust, that&#xD;
he succeeded, in due time, in transferring his&#xD;
ward and her fortune to the custody of his son.&#xD;
This occasioned some unfavorable tattle, but as&#xD;
Mercedita Wolvern, a pale, feeble girl, had no&#xD;
vill of her own, it may have been justifiable in&#xD;
somebody else's having one for her, if matters&#xD;
had turned out well. Unfortunately they did&#xD;
not, for her husband, with all the arrogance&#xD;
and vanity, and none of the brains of his sire,&#xD;
was possessed of sundry vices, which rendered&#xD;
him anything but an agreeable life companion.&#xD;
A spoiled boy, indulged and toadied, he easily&#xD;
fell into the snares that beset rich men's sons, and&#xD;
grew up a worthless and dissipated man. His&#xD;
father designed him for the legal profession, but&#xD;
&#xD;
"living like a hermit and working like a horse,"&#xD;
was not at all to the taste of young Hopeful.&#xD;
Hence, in the hope that an early marriage might&#xD;
reform him,-to say nothing of the pecuniary ad-&#xD;
vantagesof such a match,-his father had given&#xD;
him poor weak Mercedita, and her fortune, to&#xD;
wife. And a wretched connubial existence she&#xD;
had of it, for Jack Heath added drunkenness to&#xD;
his other unamiable traits, and was hardly sober&#xD;
from one day to another. This, of course, cre-&#xD;
 ated much uneasiness in the father's mind, who&#xD;
naturally hoped that his son would at least per-&#xD;
petuate the family name with dignity, if he were&#xD;
incapable of shedding lustre on it.&#xD;
"Where is John?" inquired Mr. Heath of his&#xD;
daughter-in-law, as he noticed his son's absence&#xD;
from the table.&#xD;
"Sleeping, I presume, sir," replied the young&#xD;
wife; " I heard the clock strike one before he came&#xD;
in last night."&#xD;
"What! again? And last night of all nights!"&#xD;
escaped from the father's lips. Ordinarily his&#xD;
pride prevented him from showing displeasure at&#xD;
his son's misconduct, in the presence of others,&#xD;
but that John should have so far forgotten him-&#xD;

self as to indulge in a debauch on the very day&#xD;
of his grandfather's funeral; that he should have&#xD;
gone in his mourning clothes to the town bar-&#xD;
rooms, his usual haunts, and swaggered tipsily&#xD;
along the streets, a spectacle of shame, furnish-&#xD;
ing food for scandal for a month-for the Heath&#xD;
family were considered in the light of public per-&#xD;
sonages, and every act of theirs was commented&#xD;
on by all Belton-this, all this, touched Mr. Heath&#xD;
keenly. His daughter, who was seated beside&#xD;
him, noticed his clouded brow, and asked him&#xD;
with anxiety, if anything ailed him?&#xD;
"No, nothing, child," he replied, and turning&#xD;
to the colored servant in attendance bade him&#xD;
summon John at once. Edna, the daughter, had&#xD;
but just returned from boarding-school, where&#xD;
she had spent the greater part of three previous&#xD;
years; hence she knew but little of her broth-&#xD;
er's habits, and imagined that a lack of respect&#xD;
on his part was all that had disturbed her usually&#xD;
imperturbable father.&#xD;
It's the old Obershaw blood in him-the coarse&#xD;
tastes which he inherits from his grandfather, re-&#xD;
.flected Mr. Heath with bitterness. The old man&#xD;
had the same propensity, but avarice smothered it&#xD;

MARK GILDERSLEEVE.           33&#xD;
in him. With a sigh he turned toward his daugh-&#xD;
ter for consolation. His looks dwelt on her, and&#xD;
it seemed as if it were the first time he had ever&#xD;
noticed her beauty. How lovely she has grown,&#xD;
thought he. A true Hfeath-if she were only a&#xD;
boy! Still, why should she not aspire, and reflect&#xD;
honor on me ? I shall be Governor of this State,&#xD;
next a foreign mission, an ambassadorship. All&#xD;
she would need is the opportunity. Did ever&#xD;
coronet grace a fairer brow? My daughter a&#xD;
countess or a marchioness-is there anything im-&#xD;
possible or improbable in that ?'&#xD;
While Mr. Heath was in the midst of his fan-&#xD;
ciful cogitations, the object of them was eating&#xD;
in a matter-of-fact way, and in Utter unconscious-&#xD;
ness of the ambitious views she had awakened.&#xD;
Nevertheless, there was everything to justify her&#xD;
father's pride and hopes; for Edna, a girl of&#xD;
seventeen, had a graceful figure, a cheek as deli-&#xD;
cate as a rose-petal, soft steel-blue eyes with&#xD;
dark lashes and brows, hair the hue of ripe&#xD;
wheat, and that indescribable sweetness of ex-&#xD;
pression in which American maidens surpass all&#xD;
others. Her plain, black dress, relieved only by a&#xD;
white collar and wristbands, did not in the least&#xD;

detract from her appearance, but, on the con-&#xD;
trary, enhanced her clear complexion to bril-&#xD;
liancy.  So her father thought, and his heart&#xD;
swelled with new-born pride in the possession of&#xD;
such a child. There was an unusual tenderness&#xD;
in his voice when he questioned her, "Edna,&#xD;
what are you going to do this morning ? "&#xD;
It was a purposeless question, meant simply to&#xD;
attract her attention towards him.&#xD;
Edna turned her face towards her father with&#xD;
an inquiring look, for the query was a very unusual&#xD;
one. "I intend to call on Ada Mumbie; I left&#xD;
my crochet-work there on Monday, and am going&#xD;
after it. Have you any errand for me, sir ?"&#xD;
" No, daughter. Crochet-work is certainly im-&#xD;
portant business, and should not be neglected,"&#xD;
replied her father with a smile. "I hope, how-&#xD;
ever, you have other and better ways of employ-&#xD;
ing your time."&#xD;
"I trust so, sir," said Edna.&#xD;
"I wish, my child, you would. adopt the plan&#xD;
of writing me a letter every day, or every other&#xD;
day will do. It matters not how short it may be&#xD;
--a few sentences will suffice. But I want it&#xD;
done as well as you know how, and have you bestow&#xD;
&#xD;
thought upon it. Let it consist' of a criticism on&#xD;
some book you have read, or some picture you&#xD;
have seen. For instance, you might begin to write&#xD;
criticisms on the pictures in the gallery in succes-&#xD;
sion, varying them, however, with such opinions&#xD;
of other matters, persons, or objects as may strike&#xD;
your fancy. But what I want are your ideas and&#xD;
none other, expressed in the best language you&#xD;
are capable of. You will do so, will you not?"&#xD;
"Certainly, father, if it pleases you."&#xD;
"Well, but I don't want you to do it solely be,&#xD;
cause it pleases me. I want you to acquire a&#xD;
taste for such employment. I was looking over&#xD;
some of your letters from school the other day,&#xD;
.and I was very well pleased with the style, but I&#xD;
noticed a lack of thought. True, you are still&#xD;
young, and can hardly be expected to evince much&#xD;
of that, but I want to cultivate your mind in&#xD;
that respect, and now is the time to begin. Bear&#xD;
in mind, skill in epistolary writing is a great ac-&#xD;
complishment; especially so in a woman," con-&#xD;
tinned Mr. Heath; then turning to his daughter-&#xD;
in-law he said, " Mercedita, I have an appoint-&#xD;
ment at the bank at ten. I shall be back at&#xD;
eleven. Tell John I shall expect to find him in&#xD;

and Mr. Heath rose to leave. As he opened the&#xD;
door to go out he stopped for a moment, reflect-&#xD;
ively, with his hand on the knob, "Edna."&#xD;
"Yes, father," replied the yoing girl, rising&#xD;
and going towards him.&#xD;
"When you return from your visit, come up&#xD;
into the library. I shall select some works I wish&#xD;
you to read. Don't. fail, my dear;" an   Mr.&#xD;
Heath, before leaving, imprinted a light kiss on&#xD;
his daughter's forehead. She received it with an&#xD;
expression of pleased surprise. It was the first&#xD;
time he had ever favored her in that way. So&#xD;
unwonted a demonstration of tenderness on the&#xD;
part of her brother even caused Mrs. Applegate&#xD;
to pause in the act of pouring out her fourth&#xD;
cup of tea, and stare at the scene. "Edna seems&#xD;
to be in favor this morning," she remarked when&#xD;
Mr. Heath had left, "but John, I am afraid,&#xD;
Mercedita, has greatly offended his father, and is&#xD;
very much in disfavor."&#xD;
"O Mercedita!" added Edna, " do beg him to&#xD;
apologize to father at once, and try and make&#xD;
&#xD;
amends. Just think how troubled father must be&#xD;
at grandfather's death, and that Jack should add&#xD;
to his grief is too bad. Ifo, please, entreat him,&#xD;
Mercedita, to-"&#xD;
"I do not pretend to have any influence what-&#xD;
ever over John. I might have, if he had any con-&#xD;
sideration for my feelings; but as I am siure he&#xD;
has never shown the slightest, of what use would&#xD;
my remonstrances or pleadings be ?  He may&#xD;
follow the path he has chosen without any inter-&#xD;
ference from me," answered the young wife with&#xD;
an affected indifference.&#xD;
"Father expects hint at eleven," said tdna,&#xD;
"and I hope Jack will be punctual. I wouldn't&#xD;
have father continue angry at him for the world.&#xD;
I wonder if James has told him ? I'll go and&#xD;
see;" and she hurried offin her anxiety to recon-&#xD;
cile her father and brother.&#xD;
"I think, iMercedita, if you took John in the&#xD;
right way," said Mrs. Applegate, "you might do&#xD;
a good deal with him. He is as good-hearted a&#xD;
person as ever lived. He's whimsical, to be sure,&#xD;
and perhaps we all indulged him a little too much&#xD;
when he was a boy. I'll not deny that. But then,&#xD;
yon know, a little coaxing will go a great ways."&#xD;

&#xD;
A shrug of the shoulders was the only reply&#xD;
the young wife deigned to make to this advice,&#xD;
and Mrs. Applegate continued.: "Now, I've had&#xD;
a good deal of experience in these matters, and I&#xD;
recollect very distinctly, when Mr. Applegate and&#xD;
I were first married, he was as full of whims and&#xD;
notions as could be, and naturally it was a source&#xD;
of trouble in more ways than one to me. Mr.&#xD;
Applegate utterly detested cats for one thing--&#xD;
couldn't bear 'em; indeed, he had such a great,&#xD;
detestation of them, that I verily believe it actu-&#xD;
ally affected his system; though, to be sure, he was&#xD;
consimptive, and subject to constant attacks of&#xD;
dyspepsia. I've heard of many such cases. Not&#xD;
long ago I read in the papers an account of some&#xD;
distinguished person-I forget the name, now,&#xD;
though it's a familiar one-let me see, I think it&#xD;
was Alexander the Great, or it might have been&#xD;
Luther, I won't be certain which ; but at all&#xD;
events it was some well-known and distinguished&#xD;
person who was thrown into, convulsions every-&#xD;
time he saw a black rabbit-no, not a black rab-&#xD;
bit, but a drawn sword. It was another well-&#xD;
known person who was affected in a similar way&#xD;
by a black rabbit. Now this goes to show-"&#xD;
&#xD;
What this went to show we are unable to say,&#xD;
for at this point, Mrs. Applegate's instructive,&#xD;
though somewhat irrelevant discourse, was inter-&#xD;
rupted by the entrance of Jack Heath, who was&#xD;
evidently in no amiable frame of mind, and&#xD;
under the influence, probably, of the whimsical&#xD;
state alluded to by his kinswoman. He took his&#xD;
seat in sulky silence, and then began to scold the&#xD;
waiter. lie found fault with everything--the&#xD;
steak was tdo cold, the eggs too hard, the tea&#xD;
too hot, the toast too dry, etc. The two ladies&#xD;
looked on without venturing a remark. From&#xD;
the dull, sodden look of his eyes, and his care-&#xD;
lessly brushed hair, Jack's rest and peace of mind&#xD;
had evidently been badly disturbed. He was&#xD;
large and unduly corpulent for so young a man,&#xD;
being barely two-and-twenty, although he might&#xD;
have passed for ten years older; and on his fat&#xD;
face the freshness of youth had given place to&#xD;
the inflamed flush of the toper. After a few&#xD;
mouthfuls he ,could contain himself no longer,&#xD;
and vented his spleen in a grumbling tirade.&#xD;
"Seems to me there's a devil of a row here&#xD;
about nothing. Can't have- a bit of comfort in&#xD;
this house. Come home, tired and want to have&#xD;

my sleep out, and along comes James drumming&#xD;
away at my door as if the house was on fire;&#xD;
says the old man sent him-then Edna, she must'&#xD;
come bothering me to get up. Confound it,&#xD;
some of you women are at the bottom of it all,&#xD;
I'll bet. Been complaining to the old man, have&#xD;
you 2"&#xD;
This last was directed with a scowl to his wife,&#xD;
who, without condescending to reply, arose from&#xD;
her chair and wrapping her shawl close about her,&#xD;
swept out of the room indignant, leaving Mrs.&#xD;
Applegate to confront Jack's temper alone.&#xD;
"A young feller's a fool that get's married,"&#xD;
continued Jack, addressing no one in particular.&#xD;
Mrs. Applegate, feeling this apothegm to be,&#xD;
rather a reflection on her sex, and one which&#xD;
ought not to pass unchallenged, ventured a mild&#xD;
qualification.  "Well, John, it depends very&#xD;
much whether the fellow, as you call him, is of&#xD;
a domestic disposition or. not. Now, there is&#xD;
great difference in people, and especially in mar-&#xD;
ried couples. There was Mr. Applegate, for in-&#xD;
stance; I'm sure no one could have led a happier&#xD;
life, and he often used to say to me, 'My&#xD;
dear-"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I say," repeated the nephew, dogmatically,&#xD;
"that a young feller's a fool that gets married.&#xD;
That's all. And he'll find it out sooner or later,&#xD;
I'll bet he does. To have a woman always tied&#xD;
to you, that goes whining around and complain-&#xD;
ing if a feller comes in late, or has been on a&#xD;
little jamboree with a friend and gets a little&#xD;
set up. I'd rather be hung and be done with&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Dear me, John, I wouldn't go on so about&#xD;
it," said his aunt, placatingly. "To be sure I don't&#xD;
ever remember .of Mr. Applegate's going on a&#xD;
jam-jamoree, as you call it, as he was always&#xD;
afraid of dampness and night air; but then you&#xD;
must admit that it isn't the pleasantest thing in&#xD;
the world to be wakened out of a sound sleep, or&#xD;
to sit up waiting for some one to come home,&#xD;
particularly if you are anyway delicate; and&#xD;
young people should bear in mind that the easiest&#xD;
way is always the best."&#xD;
Mrs. Applegate added a few more mollifying&#xD;
sentences of the same general application, until&#xD;
Jack, having by this time finished his breakfast&#xD;
to be appeased, and remarked in rather&#xD;
more peaceful tones, that he "was off his feed,"&#xD;

a statement which might well cause an onlooker&#xD;
to wonder pow much provender Jack consumed&#xD;
when he was "on his feed." Then pulling out&#xD;
a case, he struck a match and lit a cigar, re-&#xD;
marking as he did so to his aunt: "Old .man&#xD;
want's me in the library punctually at eleven,&#xD;
does he? Think I see myself. Not to-day, thank&#xD;
you. If I'm there I guess he'll know it. As&#xD;
the Frenchman said, 'IPve got to fry some fish,"'&#xD;
and off he lounged to the stables.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE Hon. Rufus Heath, in requesting his son's&#xD;
attendance in the library that morning, had reck-&#xD;
oned without the "Horse-show."  For that day&#xD;
was the concluding one of the County Agricul-&#xD;
tural Fair, which, though held ostensibly in&#xD;
honor of sundry overgrown vegetables and patch-&#xD;
work quilts, derived its principal attraction from&#xD;
the "Grand Exhibition of Blood and other&#xD;
Horses," which terminated it. The exhibition&#xD;
consisted in a number of fast nags showing their&#xD;
points, and competing for prizes on a race-course&#xD;
conveniently near the fair-grounds. To attend&#xD;
these "trials of speed" was far more to John&#xD;
Peter Heath's taste, than to be immured in his&#xD;
father's library copying tedious documents.&#xD;
Hence he did not deliberate long over the pater-&#xD;
nal mandate, and was soon spinning away com-&#xD;
fortably behind his trotting mare to the fair. He&#xD;
stayed there the greater part of the day; swag-&#xD;
gerng over the grounds with a knowing air;&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7700-00000022"/>&#xD;
MAR~K GILDERISL EEViE.&#xD;
&#xD;
noisily backing horses by bets with stable-men&#xD;
and blacklegs, and losing some of his wife's&#xD;
money which rather soured him, for Jack had a&#xD;
decided streak of stinginess in his character, and,&#xD;
disliked extremely to part with money that had&#xD;
not ministered to his selfish gratifications. So,&#xD;
to console himself for his ill-luck, he repaired to&#xD;
a public-house hard by, and cracked bottles of&#xD;
wine with boon companions until the remembrance&#xD;
of his losses supervened, and he became ob-&#xD;
streperous ; swore he had been cheated ; grew&#xD;
abusive; drew off his coat to fight anybody, and&#xD;
but for the interposition of the landlord, might&#xD;
have received a severe pommelling. In this con-&#xD;
dition he mounted his vehicle to return home.&#xD;
The spirited little-mare, having been kept so long&#xD;
waiting at the tavern door, had become restive,&#xD;
and it was with some difficulty that she could be&#xD;
held by the hostler while Jack got into the wagon.&#xD;
He gathered the reins, flung a dime to the man,&#xD;
and the mare released, sped off like an arrow.&#xD;
The sun was setting as Jack crossed the bridge&#xD;
over the Passaic at the north end of town, and the&#xD;
toll-gatherer noticed that the driver was (as -he&#xD;
had often seen him  before) in liquor.  Jack&#xD;
&#xD;
Heath was not at any time a very pleasing object&#xD;
to look at, and still less so when in his cups,&#xD;
for his tipsiness bore an expression of defiant&#xD;
arrogance that boded no good to intermeddlers.&#xD;
Thus, flown with insolence and wine, along he&#xD;
went, lashing his horse and driving recklessly up&#xD;
the principal street of the town, in utter disregard&#xD;
of the wayfarers, whom he roughly ordered with&#xD;
an oath to get out of his way. Just at that nio-&#xD;
ment a young man, with a slight limp in his gait,&#xD;
was crossing the street, who seemed in no haste&#xD;
to accelerate his pace at Jack Heath's bidding.&#xD;
A well-dressed young fellow he was, of about&#xD;
twenty, with a dash'of pretension in his appear-&#xD;
ance, and a light in his eye that betokened a spirit&#xD;
not likely to brook dictation.  Jack, unfortu-&#xD;
nately, was not in  condition to discriminate, and&#xD;
- -    as he approached the pedestrian, yelled, with a&#xD;
curse, "Ki-hi-cripple! Out of the way, or I'll&#xD;
run over you!" / No sooner were these words&#xD;
uttered, than the young man, pale with anger,&#xD;
raised a light cane he carried, and struck fiercely&#xD;
at the horse's head. The nervous animal, fright-&#xD;
ened at this sudden attack, sprang off sideways,&#xD;
dashing the light jagger against the curb, and&#xD;

sending its occupant headlong to the earth. Such&#xD;
an excitement in the quiet street ! The disaster&#xD;
occurred directly opposite McGoffin's "Shoe&#xD;
Emporium," and that honest tradesman ran out,&#xD;
leaving Miss Winter (a highly respectable maiden&#xD;
lady whom he was about measuring for bootees) to&#xD;
expose in her agitation and stockings her some-&#xD;
what large and bulbous feet to the brutal gaze of&#xD;
a gathering crowd.. The colored barber from over&#xD;
the way hastened to the spot with a razor in his&#xD;
hand, followed by a half-shaved client with lath-&#xD;
ered face and bib on, and then in quick succession&#xD;
loungers from the " Tanglefoot Saloon " and cor-&#xD;
ner grocery. Meanwhile, the cause of all this&#xD;
trouble,.whom we may as well introduce to the&#xD;
reader at once as Mark Gildersleeve, forgot his'&#xD;
resentment on seeing the plight of his insulter,&#xD;
and hurried off for a physiciaii, under the impres-&#xD;
sion that, perhaps, Jack Heath was killed. There&#xD;
he lay in the kennel, stunned, with a cut on his&#xD;
sconce and a contemplative crowd about him.&#xD;
Discussions arose as to whether he was dead or&#xD;
dying, and a glass of brandy was put to his lips&#xD;
as a test ; it probably being deemed conclusive that&#xD;
if he did not drink, or at least taste the beverage,&#xD;
&#xD;

he must be very nearly in the former condition.&#xD;
As he did neither, his case looked hopeless, and&#xD;
some one suggested removing him to the apothe-&#xD;
cary's shop; but Mr. Snopple, the photographer, a&#xD;
little fat man who diffused an aroma of collodion&#xD;
about him, protested strenuously, reminding the&#xD;
by-standers that it would be a violation of the&#xD;
law, and render a person liable to prosecution to&#xD;
disturb the body until the coroner came and an&#xD;
inquest was held. Advice not altogether disinter-&#xD;
ested on the part of M1r. Snopple, who, in his profes-&#xD;
sional zeal, saw at once an excellent opportunity&#xD;
for an effective picture, and did not wish the&#xD;
group disturbed while he hastened off to his&#xD;
studio for a camera. Unfortunately for the ad-&#xD;
vancement of art, before he returned, George&#xD;
Gildersleeve, the ubiquitous, appeared on the scene.&#xD;
Here was a man of action. He-took one hand&#xD;
out of its pocket, felt of Jack and pronounced&#xD;
him "right enough," and then addressing the&#xD;
crowd said, "Lay hold here, boys, some of you,&#xD;
and toss him into this cart and' get him home.&#xD;
He's hefty,"&#xD;
And "hefty " he was, sure enough, and it took&#xD;
some tugging from strong arms to lift the dead&#xD;

By this time Mark Gildersleeve had returned&#xD;
with Dr. Wattletop, and the latter accompanied&#xD;
Jack to his home, where the fears of his relatives&#xD;
were speedily allayed by his being pronounced&#xD;
not seriously injured, but uncommonly drunk.;&#xD;
When Dr. Wattletop returned to his domicil&#xD;
he found Mark Gildersleeve awaiting hini. " How&#xD;
is he, doctor ? " eagerly asked the young man.&#xD;
"Oh bless you, he'll do. The devil takes care&#xD;
of his own. Born to be hung, you know, and so&#xD;
forth. A simple contusion-lastered it up-&#xD;
he'll be all right when he gets sober. HIe's just&#xD;
ugly enough, too, to appear worse than he is, and&#xD;
frightened his sweet little sister out of her wits.&#xD;
The others, though, didn't seem to mind it so&#xD;
much, and no wonder. But what makes you so&#xD;
anxious about him ? When you came after me,&#xD;
you looked so pale and agitated hopes arose of a&#xD;
profitable patient. They're not so plenty now as&#xD;
they might be, and I welcome them with joy and&#xD;
gratitude," said the doctor, tapping Mark famil-&#xD;
iarly on the shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I feel so relieved, doctor; I was afraid he&#xD;
might be seriously hurt. He provoked me, and I&#xD;
retaliated. Had I noticed or known that he was&#xD;
drunk, perhaps I would not have minded him.&#xD;
He fell so heavily that I feared he might have&#xD;
broken his neck,"&#xD;
"lie might, I grant, but he didn't, More's the&#xD;
pity, perhaps, for his friends and family. Es-&#xD;
pecially for that poor wife of his, whom he will&#xD;
certainly kill in time, if he don't kill himself first.&#xD;
But, so you were the one that caused all this row,&#xD;
el? You didn't say anything about that before.&#xD;
ow dared you, rash youth, raise your ire against&#xD;
the heir-apparent? Fear you not the wrath of the&#xD;

If it were not for--" began Mark, with a de-&#xD;
ternuned look, which he sddel chcet&#xD;
Saddwith a quiet smile, "No one knows better&#xD;

more charms than substantial shekels ! So be it,&#xD;
and well it is so, for without those soft illusions&#xD;
the aridity of existence would be insupportable,&#xD;
the world a desert and life a blank. And now,&#xD;
my boy, while I wash my hands bring out the&#xD;

unless I am interrupted by some silly biped seek-&#xD;
ing admittance to this sphere of trouble, or some&#xD;
still sillier one reluctant to leave it, we'll have a&#xD;
snug hour or two of enjoyment. So, votary of&#xD;
Caissa, to chess-to chess."&#xD;
Soon the polished dome of the doctor's capa-&#xD;
cious head, and the curly black pate of the young&#xD;
man, were bent in intense study over the check-&#xD;
ered field of mimic battle. In silence passed the&#xD;
moments until a scratching at the door announced&#xD;
a visitor. "Ah. Dagon! Open the door, Mark,&#xD;
and let him in, please," said the doctor.&#xD;
The young man complied, and a large black&#xD;
Newfoundland dog walked gravely in towards&#xD;
the doctor, and rested his head on his master's&#xD;
knee to be caressed. "True friend--faithful heart!&#xD;

spring he drew a child out of the canal; he would&#xD;
allow himself to be cut to pieces for me, and yet&#xD;
they say he has no soul! The Turks say the&#xD;
same of women. Are we any wiser ? They say,&#xD;
too, he has no reason. Look at his expressive&#xD;
sagacious eye. The gibbering idiot has a soul&#xD;
the vilest miscreant reason; but this noble animal&#xD;
has neither, 'tis said, and man's vanity invents in-&#xD;
stint! O man--man, what a conceited fool thou&#xD;
art ! Oheck, eh? ilEa! a bold move, my boy."&#xD;
The doctor's speculations were cut short b a&#xD;
brilliant stroke on the part of his adversary and&#xD;
as the game is becoming more absorbing, and the&#xD;
players less communicative, we will leave them&#xD;
to digress a little.&#xD;

and had remained in the town ever since. Be&#xD;
this as it might, there he was and had been for&#xD;
many years, enjoying a lucrative practice, as he&#xD;
doubtless well deserved, for he was a skilful prac-&#xD;
titioner. An odd-looking man he was, a bachelor&#xD;
of very uncertain age, yet hale and vigorous; in&#xD;
person short and rotund, like the typical Briton&#xD;
of mature years, with thin wisps of brown hair&#xD;
brushed around his bald crown, and large search-&#xD;

moments of caprice he would replace it by swad-&#xD;
dling his short neck in a black cravat of many&#xD;
folds, the knot of which invariably slipped around&#xD;
and under his ear, giving him a lose and dissi-&#xD;

wherewithal to' buy indispensable remedies and&#xD;
comforts. We say had reason to thank him, for&#xD;
they seldom ventured to do so, certainly not a&#xD;
second time, for the doctor was exceedingly im--&#xD;
patient of any manifestations of gratitude, and&#xD;
generally received them with a cynical or tart&#xD;
comment.&#xD;
One weakness the doctor had in common with&#xD;
many of his countrymen.-devotion to the social&#xD;
glass and flowing bowl, and when he had in.&#xD;
dulged over freely he was a changed man. Then&#xD;
his ordinary blandness forsook him, and he be-&#xD;
came pompous and choleric. He buttoned his&#xD;
coat tightly over his chest, carried his cane under&#xD;
his arm, and gave a defiant cock to his hat. Be-&#xD;
ware then how you contradicted him; beware how&#xD;
you defended that absurd heresy, homeopathy;&#xD;
and above all, beware how you disparaged, even&#xD;
in the remotest degree, her Majesty of England,&#xD;
God bless her! as he would add, reverently lift&#xD;
ing his hat. His loyalty and pomposity increased&#xD;
in proportion to the depths of his potations, but,&#xD;
whether in rigid obedience to a self-imposed law,&#xD;
or owing to the resistant power of his brain, he&#xD;
never appeared to exceed a certain well-defined&#xD;

limit; and no one had ever seen the doctor over-&#xD;
come, or known him to be in a worse state than&#xD;
that peculiar one indicated by a highly bur-&#xD;
nished nose, tetchy dignity, and exaggerated self-&#xD;
importance. The doctor was generally in this&#xD;
condition three evenings in the week, beginning at&#xD;
about four o'clock post-meridian, and so far from&#xD;
its being considered prejudicial to the exercise of&#xD;
his professional duties by his patients, many of&#xD;
them religiously believed that his sagacity was&#xD;
keener and skill greater at those times than at&#xD;
others.&#xD;
The doctor was an enigma to the Belton folk.&#xD;
While they all respected him for his good quali-&#xD;
ties, many were offended at his sarcasm, puzzled&#xD;
by his paradoxes, or displeased at his oracular&#xD;
utterances. A few even pronounced him an "in-&#xD;
fidel" and an "atheist." Opinionated George&#xD;
Gildersleeve objected to the doctor's opinionat-&#xD;
iveness, and rated him a "pig-headed John Bull."&#xD;
As to the charge of atheism, who could have be-&#xD;
lieved it that had ever seen the doctor at service,&#xD;
as he stood reverentially burying his red face in&#xD;
his stiff hat on Sundays in the fifth pew from the&#xD;
chancel, in the middle aisle of St. Jude's ?&#xD;
&#xD;
" A theist, bosh!" said the doctor; ."the old&#xD;
Latin proverb, Ubi trees medici duo at/ei, is sim-&#xD;
ply nonsensical. Who comes so closely in con-&#xD;
tact with the mysterious ways of God, and realizes&#xD;
so thoroughly his own ignorance and impotence,&#xD;
as the physician? No-no, a corner of the veil&#xD;
has been uplifted to us, and we stand appalled&#xD;
and humble."&#xD;
Mark Gildersleeve was almost an. adopted son&#xD;
of the old physician, who had taken the youth in&#xD;
affection and proved an invaluable friend to him,&#xD;
chiefly by directing a course of reading and study.&#xD;
A priceless benefit this to Mark, whose advanta-&#xD;
ges for instruction had been slight, for he had lost&#xD;
his parents at an early age, and been left to the&#xD;
care of his half-brother George, or rather to his&#xD;
half-brother's wife. It would have been difficult&#xD;
to find more dissimilar beings than these two&#xD;
brothers. George was the true son of Eben Gil-&#xD;
dersleeve, the tough old smith who could forge&#xD;
the best horse-shoe' in the county; while Mark&#xD;
inherited the character and tastes of his mother,&#xD;
Eben Gildersleeve's second wife, a woman of&#xD;
beauty and delicacy, a rustic Venus mated to a&#xD;
village Vulcan. George was boisterous, given to&#xD;

&#xD;
bully and boast, and hid his purse-pride in an af-&#xD;
fected contempt for the world's opinion. Mark,&#xD;
on the contrary, was reserved, and rendered mor-&#xD;
bidly sensitive by a slight lameness resulting from&#xD;
an injury received in childhood-a mere blemish,&#xD;
though, in an otherwise well-knit and graceful&#xD;
form. For all his reserve the lad had a resolute&#xD;
and ambitious spirit. Gifted with quick percep-&#xD;
tion, and a natural aptitude for mathematics, he&#xD;
had become, although almost self-taught, profi-&#xD;
cient as a mechanical engineer. After a common-&#xD;
school education, his brother, in accordance with&#xD;
the theory that the only road to success was&#xD;
through a diligent use of the flexors and exten-&#xD;
sors, set him to work in the shops, but it was not&#xD;
long before he was found to be more useful in&#xD;
the draughting room. Young as he was, Mark&#xD;
had introduced some valuable improvements in&#xD;
his brother's works, although that independent&#xD;
fellow was not over-ready to acknowledge it. On&#xD;
the contrary, he rather berated the young man&#xD;
behind his back, for a fop who cared for nothing&#xD;
but dress, or a fool who was occupied with dreams&#xD;
- and poetry instead of devoting himself to his busi-&#xD;
ness. Mark, it must be admitted, sinned a little&#xD;
&#xD;
in that way, although not to an extent to justify&#xD;
his brother's railings. Full of enthusiasm and&#xD;
high aspirations,.he scorned mere money-making,&#xD;
and as he earned enough to satisfy his wants he&#xD;
bestowed no further thought in that direction.&#xD;
This was a source of displeasure to George.&#xD;
" Confound the fellow," he would exclaim in the&#xD;
barber-shop, perhaps, or at Bird's livery stable,&#xD;
"Confound the fellow! he's .no slouch, but as&#xD;
smart as they make 'em, and if he'd only stick to&#xD;
his work he'd be a rich man in time. I never&#xD;
had much of a head for figures, but it comes nat-&#xD;
'ral to him. If he's a mind to, he can do more&#xD;
work than any other two men you can scare up,&#xD;
and if he aint a-mind, you can't coax or drive him.&#xD;
He'll go off and jingle away by the hour on a&#xD;
piano, like a girl, or play chess or read novels&#xD;
half the night. Why, he's even got a banjo up in&#xD;
his room that he strums away on like a nigger&#xD;
minstrel" (alluding to a Spanish guitar that&#xD;
Mark had bought, probably.with the romantic in-&#xD;
tention of practising seguidillas). "Look at me,"&#xD;
George would add as a clincher; "the only music&#xD;
ever I made was with a riveting hammer on a,&#xD;
boiler,-/or a sledge on an anvil, and am I any the&#xD;

worse for it ? Not much, I think, and here I am,&#xD;
as independent as a hog on ice ! Don't owe a&#xD;
man a dollar in the world, and though I don't&#xD;
roost in as big a house as Rufe Heath or Pop&#xD;
Mumbie up on the hill yonder, they'll take my&#xD;
note at the bank as quick as either of theirs if I&#xD;
should ask it, which I don't, as I pays as I goes;,&#xD;
and what's more, I can dust any of 'em on the&#xD;
plank-road any day of the week, with as pretty a&#xD;
pair o' flyers as there is in the State, and if you&#xD;
don't believe it here's the soap to back it for&#xD;
any amount from fifty to five thousand! "&#xD;
And he would conclude customarily by draw-&#xD;
ing out a well-stuffed wallet, and slapping it ener-&#xD;
getically, with a defiant look at the by-standers.&#xD;
That wallet was George's ultimo ratio, and when&#xD;
pushed in an argument, or at loss for a reply, he&#xD;
would flourish it at his opponent, with an offer&#xD;
to wager any sum on the moot-point; a rebutter&#xD;
which, if it did not carry conviction, enabled&#xD;
George to close the issue in a triumphant manner.&#xD;
There was a story current to the effect that he&#xD;
had once startled a tableful of Methodist clergy-&#xD;
men, assembled to take tea at Mrs. Gildersleeve's&#xD;
during a conference, by proffering to the decorous&#xD;
&#xD;
men a bet on the correct interpretation of a dis-&#xD;
puted passage in St. John; but this lacked con-&#xD;
firmation, for George, if he had but little respect&#xD;
for any one else, had a great deal for his wife, and&#xD;
as such an act would have shocked her exceed-&#xD;
ingly, it is not at all likely that it took place.&#xD;
The sagacious reader has doubtless come to the&#xD;
conclusion that the Gildersleeve family was com-&#xD;
posed of rather incongruous members, aid yet, for&#xD;
one comprising such opposite characters, its harmo-&#xD;
ny was remarkable. They occupied a small two-&#xD;
story dwelling with a flower-garden attached, in&#xD;
a side street, not far from the Archimedes Works.&#xD;
A large, bright brass door-plate bore in very loud&#xD;
letters the name: GILDERSLEEVE-as if there&#xD;
were none other of that name in the universe, or as&#xD;
if this was the Gildersleeve par excellence of all&#xD;
who were fortunate enough to bear that honest&#xD;
patronymic. Aside from this, the residence pre-&#xD;
sented a very quiet and modest appearance. The&#xD;
interior was plainly furnished, but neat as wax.&#xD;
In the little parlor were old-fashioned mahogany&#xD;
chairs and sofas dark with age, but polished, and&#xD;
protected with snowy tidies. In one corner was&#xD;
Mark's piano, and on either side of the chimney-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7700-00000030"/>&#xD;
MARK GILDERSLEEVE.        61&#xD;
&#xD;
breast hung portraits in oil of Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
Gildersleeve, taken when they were first married,&#xD;
and looking wooden in port and flat as to per-&#xD;
spective, faced on the opposite side by photo-&#xD;
graphic likenesses of the same at a mature age.&#xD;
Then between the windows was a colored photo-&#xD;
graph of Mr. Gildersleeve in his costume of&#xD;
foreman of a fire company, with red shirt, leathern&#xD;
cap, and trumpet; and still another representing&#xD;
him in his regalia as a Sir Knight of the Sancho&#xD;
Panza Commandery of the Knights of the Golden&#xD;
Fleece. George had a passion for counterfeit&#xD;
presentments of himself, and in the album on the&#xD;
centre-table might have been found a number of&#xD;
others, taken in various attitudes and in various&#xD;
expressions of obstinacy, by that distinguished&#xD;
artist, Alonzo Snopple, Esq., who kept' duplicates&#xD;
in his "studio" and never failed to call visitors'&#xD;
attention to them as remarkable pictures of a&#xD;
remarkable self-made man. "Fine head," he&#xD;
would say, "very fine head-rare combination of&#xD;
intellect and force--especially force. Strongly&#xD;
marked lineaments, well adapted for Rembrandt&#xD;
effects. Observe the lights and shadows, that&#xD;
well-defined nose, etc.;" and George seemingly&#xD;
&#xD;
was not indisposed to allow the public every&#xD;
opportunity to familiarize itself with the repre-&#xD;
sentation of such a masterpiece of nature in the&#xD;
way of a head. Besides his love of portraiture,&#xD;
he was given to keeping fast trotters and game-&#xD;
cocks, and in the stables at the Works were stalls&#xD;
devoted to a span of the speediest Morgans for&#xD;
the owner's private use, and in the stable yard&#xD;
strutted a certain breed of "orange-piles," whose&#xD;
pugnacious qualities were almost as well known&#xD;
as those of the celebrated fowls of the Derby&#xD;
walk; the dauntless game-cocks, that:&#xD;
" symbolize their lord."&#xD;
These animals enabled George to indulge occa-&#xD;
sionally in a little sportsmanlike relaxation, and&#xD;
spice his toil-earned wealth by a few chance dol-&#xD;
lars won from fickle fortune.&#xD;
Mrs. Gildersleeve was an industrious little&#xD;
housekeeper with an equable temper, and an&#xD;
unbounded and unquestioning faith in her hus-&#xD;
band ; scarcely less so, too, in her brother-in-law&#xD;
Mark, whom she had brought up from childhood&#xD;
and looked upon as a son-an affection recipro-&#xD;
cated by the young man, who loved her as if she&#xD;

were his mother, and with reason, for she could&#xD;
not have been more devoted had she really stood&#xD;
in that relation to him. The only thing that ever&#xD;
cast a shadow on her uniform serenity and cheer-&#xD;
fulness, was the remissness in their religious&#xD;
duties of the two beings the nearest and dearest&#xD;
to her. She had more than once mentioned this&#xD;
subject to the Rev. Samuel Sniffen, and this&#xD;
good man had striven zealously to bring these&#xD;
wayward sheep into the fold, but with small&#xD;
effect; for George Gildersleeve seemed flint, and&#xD;
his brother quicksilver. Nevertheless, Mrs. Gil-&#xD;
dersleeve had gained ground and progressed so&#xD;
far in her endeavors at reclamation, that her hus-&#xD;
band invariably accompanied her to meeting&#xD;
every Sabbath morning and afternoon, while&#xD;
Mark escorted her to the evening service, the&#xD;
mornings and afternoons of that sacred day being&#xD;
devoted by the erratic youth to St. Jude's. It&#xD;
was an edifying sight to behold George at meet-&#xD;
ing. The stolidity with which he received the&#xD;
earnest and vivifying sermons of the Rev. Samuel&#xD;
Sniffen-as if they imparted teachings which the&#xD;
rest of the congregation would do well to heed,&#xD;
but which did not concern him in the least.--was&#xD;
&#xD;
the despair of the excellent minister. The&#xD;
hardened sinner had even shown, on frequent&#xD;
occasions, a tendency to nap through exhortations&#xD;
of the most vehement and fervid character.&#xD;
What was to be done with such a soul? The&#xD;
only answer he would vouchsafe to the friendliest&#xD;
and most persuasive counsel was, that his wife&#xD;
was good enough for both of them, and he felt&#xD;
insured as to the future, as she pio doubt would&#xD;
have influence enough to "pull him through" in&#xD;
any event. "She'll take care of me, you bet,"&#xD;
he would add; "she's good enough to save a half&#xD;
a dozen;" and in this conviction of security noth-&#xD;
ing could shake . him.  Brother Sniffen then&#xD;
wisely concluded that as it seemed a hopeless task&#xD;
for the patient to obtain sanctification through&#xD;
faith, he would induce him to try the efficacy of&#xD;
good works, and in this laudable endeavor called&#xD;
upon him constantly for contributions to the sup-&#xD;
port and propagation of the Methodist Episcopal&#xD;
persuasion, and as George always responded&#xD;
liberally to all such requests, he stood well with&#xD;
the good people of that sect, in spite of his stiff-&#xD;
neckedness,&#xD;
Mark was more tractable. He was willing to&#xD;

&#xD;
do almost anything to please his sister-in-law ex-&#xD;
cept, perhaps, giving up his attendance at St.&#xD;
Jude's. And, whence, it may be asked, arose this&#xD;
preference. in the young man for that particular&#xD;
temple of worship? Did he hunger after the&#xD;
spiritual truth as dispensed by the rector, the&#xD;
Rev. Spencer Abbott? 'Alas! we fear not. Did&#xD;
he deem his tenor voice an indispensable ad-&#xD;
junct to the church choir?  Strict truth compels&#xD;
us to say nay. Mrs. Gildersleeve, for her part,&#xD;
attributed his partiality for the Episcopal service&#xD;
to Dr. Wattletop's influence; but the worthy&#xD;
lady's perspicuity was entirely at fault, and the&#xD;
motive that impelled her brother-in-law to such&#xD;
an assiduous attendance at St. Jude's was not&#xD;
any preference for a liturgy, or leaning for the&#xD;
tenets of that church; in fact, we regret to say,&#xD;
it was not any religious conviction whatever, but&#xD;
simply and solely-love ! Love for the sweetest&#xD;
profile ever imagined; the profile that he was con-&#xD;
tinually sketching on the draughting sheets or&#xD;
tracing-paper; that distracted him while at work;&#xD;
that drew him to St. Jude's, but drew his attention&#xD;
away from the excellent sermons of the young&#xD;
and worthy rector. And the possessor of that&#xD;
&#xD;
profile was-Edna Heath. She, of course, was&#xD;
attentive to the sermon as good girls always are,&#xD;
and utterly unconscious of the glances directed at&#xD;
her from the organ-loft, where Mark poured&#xD;
forth the pantings of his sighing soul in song.&#xD;
Utterly unconscious, too, of the influence she ex-&#xD;
erted over that youth's ideas and aspirations; how&#xD;
she had inspired him with vaulting ambition, and&#xD;
given him a corresponding distaste for his calling;&#xD;
how, for her sake, he desired to become famous,&#xD;
and, of all things, to be a poet! In this frame&#xD;
of mind; this fervent exaltation, the church&#xD;
seemed a haven of bliss to him, and his worship-&#xD;
ping, we grieve to say, was directed chiefly to the&#xD;
idol who sat in the double pew in the transept&#xD;
nearest to the chancel. All his longing for fame&#xD;
was solely to lay it at her feet, and win not only&#xD;
her favor, but her admiration. He scarcely de-&#xD;
sired the one without the other; for once she had&#xD;
pitied him, and that pity had left a sting which&#xD;
could only be healed by the salve of admiration.&#xD;
How and when this uneffaced wound was re-&#xD;
ceived, we shall divulge in the succeeding chap-&#xD;

&#xD;
YEARs before, when our young people were&#xD;
children, a juvenile party was given one evening&#xD;
at Mr. Heath's, in honor of his son's birthday.&#xD;
The children's schoolmates were invited, and&#xD;
Mark Gildersleeve among the number. Miss&#xD;
Edna, in white with a big blue sash, was naturally&#xD;
enough an object of much devotion to the young&#xD;
gallants in roundabouts and pumps, who certainly&#xD;
evinced good taste, as the little belle was lovely&#xD;
as delicate bloom, bright eyes, and rich curls&#xD;
could make her. Poor Mark was dismal enough&#xD;
while the dancing was in progress, as his sensi-&#xD;
tiveness in regard to his lameness, and his Meth-&#xD;
odist relative's scruples had prevented him from&#xD;
learning that accomplishment; hence, he would&#xD;
have passed but a dull evening, had it not been&#xD;
for Edna, whose kind little heart prompted her&#xD;
to select him as her partner in "Come, Philan-&#xD;
ders," "fOats, peas, beans, and barley," etc., when&#xD;
those games came on the carpet. This partiality&#xD;

on the part of Miss Edna naturally engendered&#xD;
much jealousy in the breasts-of her numerous ad-&#xD;
mirers; and one, a malicious urchin, with the in-&#xD;
stincts of an lago, plotted to make Jack Heath&#xD;
his avenger. Jack, an overgrown, lubberly boy,&#xD;
swelling with the importance of his position, and&#xD;
the possession of a gold watch and tail-coat, was&#xD;
diverting himself by teasing the girls and play-&#xD;
ing tricks on the younger lads. Young Iago&#xD;
suggested ,having some fun with Mark. Said&#xD;
he, "I will go and get Willie Hull and Mortimer,&#xD;
and we'll all hustle him, eh, Jack?"&#xD;
"All right," said Jack; "he's a mean sneak,&#xD;
anyway. He thinks himself so smart. He's no&#xD;
business here. Edna sent him an invitation; I&#xD;
wouldn't."&#xD;
The boys surrounded Mark and jeered him.&#xD;
" Where are your gloves ? " inquired lago, Junior,&#xD;
pointing to Mark's bare hands. The poor boy&#xD;
colored, for the other lads wore white kids, while&#xD;
he had none-an omission due, most likely, to his&#xD;
sister's ignorance of the requirements of fashion-&#xD;
able society.&#xD;

like it? What lots of money it must have cost,&#xD;
eh ? " cried Jack, in affected -admiration, as he&#xD;
pulled the boy's rather gaudy necktie.&#xD;
"Let me alone," said Mark, indignantly.&#xD;
"Suppose I won't," continued Jack, "what are,&#xD;
you going to do about it, limpey?"&#xD;
Stung by this cruel taunt, Mark's eyes flashed,&#xD;
and on the instant he struck his insulter full in&#xD;
the face. Jack, for the moment, was bewildered&#xD;
by this sudden and unexpected attack, but soon&#xD;
recovering himself, rushed at Mark, threw him&#xD;
down, and fell on him. Over they rolled in their&#xD;
struggles, but Jack, being older and heavier,&#xD;
soon had the best of it, and kept the other under.&#xD;
The girls screamed, and Professor Banghoffen&#xD;
sprang from the grand piano to separate the&#xD;
combatants. This was no easy matter for a&#xD;
pursy man, and a kick in the stomach from the&#xD;
writhing legs caused him to recoil, pant, and&#xD;
consider. The colored domestic, however, soon&#xD;
came to his assistance, and between them they&#xD;
succeeded, after much puffing on the part of the&#xD;
professor and the fracture of his spectacles, in&#xD;
stopping the fight. The contestants were not&#xD;
much hurt, but stood glaring at each other with&#xD;

&#xD;
rumpled hair and flushed countenances. The&#xD;
children nearly all blamed Mark, but Edna,&#xD;
greatly to his surprise, took his part with much&#xD;
warmth. She had overheard the provocation,&#xD;
and now stood by him with a very indignant and&#xD;
determined air.&#xD;
"I've a good mind to tell father, Jack, how&#xD;
you have behaved; I think it is real shameful.&#xD;
Mark is your guest, and it is very-very mean&#xD;
indeed, and real wicked to tease him as you did;&#xD;
and you ought to be thankful .in your prayers&#xD;
that you are not lame as he is, and ought to pity&#xD;
him, and be kind to him, instead of teasing him&#xD;
so unkindly."&#xD;
" You seem very fond of him all of a sudden,"&#xD;
sneered Jack; "Guess he must be your beau.&#xD;
Better kiss him, hadn't you?"&#xD;
At this sally the boys laughed, and Edna, cov-&#xD;
ering her blushing face with her hands, burst&#xD;
into tears and went away sobbing. "You ought&#xD;
(sob) you ought (sob) ought to be ashamed. I'll&#xD;
(sob) I'll go (sob--sob--sob) and tell father&#xD;

demonstration, and as this last incident broke up&#xD;
the party, went home with a spark in his bosom&#xD;
that was destined to kindle into a flame.&#xD;
Mark arose early the next morning, and before&#xD;
going to school stopped to see Dr. Wattletop.&#xD;
The doctor was still abed, for he had been up&#xD;
nearly all the previous night ; nevertheless, he&#xD;
rose cheerfully at the call, broken rest having&#xD;
become a second nature to him, drew on a dress-&#xD;
ing-gown, and went into his consulting-room,&#xD;
where he found Mark waiting.&#xD;
"Well, my lad, what is it?" inquired the doc-&#xD;
tor, who was unacquainted with his visitor.&#xD;
"Doctor, I am lame, and I want you to cure&#xD;
me," said Mark.&#xD;
" Lame, eh? fHow long have you been so, and&#xD;
what caused it?"&#xD;
"Ever since I was a child. I was knocked&#xD;
down by a runaway horse and run over by a&#xD;
wagon. My ankle was broken, I believe."&#xD;
"lHum-um. Take off your shoe and stocking.&#xD;
Lie down on that sofa, and let me look at your&#xD;
ankle."&#xD;
Mark did as he was bid, and the doctor drew&#xD;
up a chair and sat down by him to examine the&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
defective joint. The boy's black eyes were fixed&#xD;
with a searching gaze on the doctor's face, as if&#xD;
to read his thoughts, but there was nothing to be&#xD;
derived from the grave, sphinx-like countenance.&#xD;
The eager, inquisitive look of the lad, however,&#xD;
did not escape the physician's notice.&#xD;
"What is your name, my boy?" inquired the&#xD;
doctor.&#xD;
"Mark Gildersleeve, sir."&#xD;
"Ah, you're Mr. Gildersleeve the iron-master's&#xD;
son, are you?"&#xD;
"No, sir, his brother."&#xD;
"His brother, eh! Who attended you when&#xD;
you received the injury?"&#xD;
"Dr. Pokemore, sir."&#xD;
"Dr. Pokemore, eh! He is your brother's&#xD;
family physician, is he not?"&#xD;
"  Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Who sent you to me?"&#xD;
"No one, sir. I came myself."&#xD;
"Why did you not go to Dr. Pokemore ?"&#xD;
"Because he said I could not be cured."&#xD;
The doctor after some reflection gave a doubt-&#xD;
ful nod, and said, "If anything can be done it&#xD;
will only be after a painful operation.''&#xD;

"I'll stand anything, doctor, if you will only&#xD;
cure me. You may cut me, or do anything you,&#xD;
like, only make me walk like other boys."&#xD;
The doctor took from a case of surgical instru-&#xD;
ments a bright bistoury, which he caused to glitter&#xD;
before the boy's eyes, as he felt its edge.&#xD;
A plucky little fellow, thought the doctor,&#xD;
(struck by the unflinching look of determination&#xD;
in the boy's countenance,) and seems to be in ear-&#xD;
nest. "You say that you have been this way from&#xD;
infancy; why are you so anxious to be helped&#xD;
now i"&#xD;
4 Because-because-they worry me about it,"&#xD;
replied Mark.&#xD;
"Worry you-that's very unkind. Come, tell&#xD;
me all about it. I suspect there's a little history&#xD;
behind this, and you must make me your con-&#xD;
fidant."&#xD;
Led on by the doctor's kind way, Mark exposed&#xD;
the wound his pride had received; related the&#xD;
story of his fight with Jack Heath (omitting,&#xD;
however, any mention of Edna's interference),&#xD;
and again begged the doctor to remove the im-&#xD;
pediment in his walk, asserting his willingness&#xD;
to submit to any operation, however painful, that&#xD;
&#xD;
might be deemed necessary to effect 'the object.&#xD;
Pleased with the boy's frankness and resolution,&#xD;
and desirous to help him, the doctor again ex-&#xD;
amined the maimed ankle. . A slow, fixed purs-&#xD;
ing of his lips expressed doubt, and the boy's&#xD;
countenance fell. There was a glimpse of hope,&#xD;
though, in the doctor's words, who told Mark&#xD;
that although he could not say anything encourag-&#xD;
.ing now, he would talk the matter over with his&#xD;
(Mark's) brother, "And if he is willing, I will&#xD;
take you to New York with me, where we can&#xD;
consult the best skill, and if there be a probabil--&#xD;
ity of helping you, it shall be done."&#xD;
A fine head, thought the doctor, passing his&#xD;
hand over Mark's broad forehead ; there should&#xD;
be something there. "Stop a bit, Mark; what do&#xD;
you intend to be when you grow up, my boy?"&#xD;
" I don't know, sir."&#xD;
"What would you like to be, then?"&#xD;
"I'd like," replied Mark, after some hesitation,&#xD;
"I think-I'd like to be-a hero."&#xD;
" A hero, eh ! Come, that's modest and laud-&#xD;
able. But what kind of a hero, pray?"&#xD;
" Like-like Jack Sheppard."&#xD;
"Jack Sheppard, umph ! Why so?" said the&#xD;

doctor, rather surprised at this example and&#xD;
selection.&#xD;
" Oh he was such a smart, brave fellow ! They&#xD;
couldn't keep him in prison," replied Mark, wag-&#xD;
ging his head in admiration.&#xD;
"But didn't he drive his poor mother crazy by&#xD;
his conduct, or something of that sort?" inquired&#xD;
the doctor. "That wasn't brave or smart, I take&#xD;
it, but rather mean and contemptible for a hero,&#xD;
wasn't it?"&#xD;
"Yes, that was mean and bad," echoed Mark,&#xD;
reflectively; " I think I'd rather be a Crusader."&#xD;
" Better, much better. But where did you&#xD;
hear of Jack Sheppard ?".&#xD;
"Jerry Cook lent me the book, and I am read-&#xD;
ing it."&#xD;
"Fond of reading, Mark?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Well, tell me what you have read."&#xD;
"I've read 'The Three Spaniards,' and&#xD;
'Rinaldo Rinaldini,' 'Illustrious Highwaymen,'&#xD;
'Three-fingered Jack,' and-"&#xD;
"I see-I see. Now, my boy, as you are fond&#xD;
of reading, Il lend you a book to read that's&#xD;
worth all the books that were ever written, ex-&#xD;
&#xD;
cept, perhaps, the plays of Shakeseare. It is&#xD;
called 'The Adventures of the Ingenious Knight,&#xD;
Don Quixote of La IMancha.' Now, after you&#xD;
have read it, I'll lend you the plays of Williani&#xD;
Shakespeare, and after you have read those, you&#xD;
will have read the very best product of human&#xD;
intellect in the way of fiction. I do not expect&#xD;
that you will understand those books fully; it&#xD;
may take you all your life to do that, but if you&#xD;
can get but an idea of their contents, or rather,&#xD;
acquire but a taste for them, it will be sufficient&#xD;
for the present,"&#xD;
Mark thanked the doctor, and trudged away,&#xD;
delighted, with the Don Quixote under his arm.&#xD;
This was the beginning of an intimacy, and close&#xD;
friendship between the two. As he had promised,&#xD;
Dr. Wattletop took the boy, with his brother's&#xD;
consent, to New York, and consulted the best&#xD;
chirurgical authority on. his case ; but, as the&#xD;
doctor bad feared, without being able to obtain&#xD;
any encouragement as to the possibility of re-&#xD;
lieving him from the imperfection in his gait.&#xD;
Mark, for a time, was greatly disappointed at&#xD;
this result; but finally this feeling wore away, and&#xD;
grateful for all the kindness shown to him by the&#xD;

doctor, became attached to him, and was never&#xD;
more happy than when able to reciprocate with&#xD;
some slight service. The doctor's slender stock&#xD;
of literature was soon devoured by the boy, but&#xD;
as the books were choice, they bore re-reading and&#xD;
study. They consisted chiefly of poetry and a&#xD;
few standard novels. Histories there were none,&#xD;
the doctor in regard. to these being of Walpole's&#xD;
opinion, "Lies, my boy, lies, mere records of&#xD;
men's prejudices and self-glorification. Sound,&#xD;
wholesome truth is found in a good poem or&#xD;
noble novel."&#xD;
Thus did Mark imbibe his taste for the ideal,&#xD;
and thus was his mental growth fashioned by the&#xD;
eccentric physician. His moral training, too,&#xD;
was not overlooked by this teacher, but the code&#xD;
inculcated was a simple one, and merely this:&#xD;
"Be just. There is but one virtue-justice," as-&#xD;
serted Dr. Wattletop ; "men resort to makeshifts,&#xD;
such as generosity, or charity, but they are but&#xD;
confessions of their shortcomings in respect to&#xD;
justice. If men were not unjust, there would be&#xD;
no need of generosity, or charity, and forgiveness&#xD;
would be either uncalled for, or a crime."&#xD;
There was doubtless a deal of the stoic in these&#xD;
&#xD;
teachings, but it was on such philosophy that&#xD;
Mark was nourished.&#xD;
As for his boyish passion for Edna Heath, that&#xD;
grew apace, but accompanied with the bitter re-&#xD;
membrance that the sympathy she had shown&#xD;
him was prompted simply by commiseration. He&#xD;
was made none the less unhappy also, by noticing&#xD;
that since the eventful party Edna was not as&#xD;
cordial as formerly, but inclined to be distant; for&#xD;
the little beauty thought, perhaps, that she had&#xD;
been too pointed in her sympathy and desired,&#xD;
like older maidens, to set matters aright by an&#xD;
excess of reserve in the future. Very soon after&#xD;
this, however, she was sent to a seminary at Bur-&#xD;
lington, and during an interval of several years&#xD;
made but short and infrequent visits home. In&#xD;
this way the intercourse between the two gradu-&#xD;
ally became less familiar, until now, Edna having&#xD;
attained young lady-hood, it was formal, and re-&#xD;
stricted to what is called a bowing acquaintance.&#xD;
Mark finally imagined he detected an intention&#xD;
on her part to repel him, and met it by assuming&#xD;
an attitude of corresponding hauteur. Still, the&#xD;
secret passion burned within his breast with&#xD;

&#xD;
steady fervor. It was his greatest joy to see her,&#xD;
although he never did so without those bitter&#xD;
words recurring to him: You ought to be thank-&#xD;
ful you are not lame as he is, and ought to pity&#xD;
him. Each word a thorn pressed to the quick!&#xD;
Meaning to be kind, how cruel she had been!&#xD;
How much sharper those words had stung than&#xD;
the mean taunt of her brother ! that he could for-&#xD;
give and forget, for it came from one he de-&#xD;
spised, but could he ever forgive or forget the&#xD;
wound inflicted by her expressions of pity ?&#xD;
Nothing but a complete and voluntary retraction&#xD;
on her part could compensate for that, and he&#xD;
resolved to toil with energy, and patience-to&#xD;
strain nerve and brain-to undergo, and brave&#xD;
everything until he had achieved distinction&#xD;
enough to excite her admiration, and wonder&#xD;
that she could ever have deemed him an object&#xD;
of compassion. Ridiculous, self-tormenting res-&#xD;
olutions these will appear to common sense ; yet&#xD;
were they but the natural impulses of a proud,&#xD;
sensitive, and we may add rather conceited youth,&#xD;
full of the illusions of life, and pushing every&#xD;
sentiment to extremes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Now that the intelligent reader is better ac-&#xD;
quainted with our hero's history and aspirations,&#xD;
he will at once conceive that Mark was rather&#xD;
alarmedfor more reasons than one at the possible&#xD;
consequences of his second altercation with John&#xD;
Peter Heath, as related in a previous chapter.&#xD;
Dr. Wattletop had relieved his fears in relation&#xD;
to any serious injury's resulting to the brother;&#xD;
but, reflected Mark, what will the sister think of&#xD;
it, and how has the affair been represented to&#xD;
her? Most likely, I am held up as a ruflian, who&#xD;
brutally and causelessly assailed her brother.&#xD;
Shall I submit, and let the future explain, or had&#xD;
I better seek an interview, and set myself right?&#xD;
I must do it, and I'll do it at once, was his de-&#xD;
cision--a decision he arrived at the more readily,&#xD;
as it afforded him an excellent pretext to see.and&#xD;
converse with 'the object of his secret and con-&#xD;
stant adoration. But, on consideration, fearing&#xD;

" concluded reluctantly to address himself to her&#xD;
father, and offer a frank explanation of the oc-&#xD;
currence. It required an effort to come to this&#xD;
decision, for Mark dreaded Mr. Heath's patroniz-&#xD;
ing politeness, and invariably avoided meeting&#xD;
him. But he conquered his repugnance on re-&#xD;
flecting that that gentleman was fortunate enough&#xD;
to be Edna's father, and, moreover, that there&#xD;
was a likelihood of meeting and conversing with&#xD;
that young lady in compensation. In view of the&#xD;
latter probability, he prepared himself by making&#xD;
a more than usual neat and careful toilet, and by&#xD;
the time he was ready to start, his thoughts were&#xD;
far more occupied with Miss Edna's eyes, than&#xD;
with her brother's broken head. Qff he started&#xD;
for the "Cliff," but soon his courage failed him,&#xD;
as he imagined the reception he was likely to&#xD;
meet with. Twice or thrice he stopped, hesi-&#xD;
tated, and only continued after much cogitation.&#xD;
Resolutely he walked past the gate-lodge,.and up&#xD;
the avenue that led to the house. He rang the&#xD;
bell with a thumping heart. It was the first time&#xD;
he had crossed that thrashol&amp;amp; since he had been&#xD;
to Jack Heath's birthday party, and he remem-&#xD;
bered the coloi6d servant who now -ushered him&#xD;
&#xD;
into a reception room, as the same one-with a&#xD;
gray poll now, however-who had assisted the&#xD;
pianist in stopping the fight on that memorable&#xD;
occasion. Mark sent his name up to Mr. Heath,&#xD;
with the wish to be allowed a few moments' con-&#xD;
versation with him. That gentleman, evidently,&#xD;
was in no haste to see his visitor, for he kept him&#xD;
waiting a long time. Meanwhile, Mark amused&#xD;
himself by staring at the pictures on the wall, and&#xD;
looking over some books that lay on the pier-&#xD;
table, when he heard light tripping footsteps&#xD;
coming towards him, and,' turning suddenly,&#xD;
beheld Edna standing in the doorway in a startled&#xD;
attitude-a charming picture of a surprised&#xD;
maiden, lithe figure poised forward, with slightly&#xD;
parted lips, and fine, large eyes opened iii full&#xD;
wonder. "Oh, I beg pardon-excuse me, I&#xD;
thought it was father " and advancing, she added&#xD;
in a frank, pleasant way, "Why, this is Mark&#xD;
Gildersleeve."&#xD;
All the blood in Mark's body rushed to his&#xD;
face as he bowed and explained, rather awk-&#xD;
wardly, that he had called to see her father.&#xD;
"I'll go and call him," said Edna; but as she&#xD;
was about leaving the room, Mark arrested her&#xD;

with an eager exclamation, "Stay, Miss heath;&#xD;
do not leave yet, I beseech you. One moment-&#xD;
I beg of you-Pray tell me, is your brother&#xD;
severely hurt?"&#xD;
"Not seriously so. He slept quite soundly&#xD;
last night. He very fortunately escaped any&#xD;
great harm. His horse ran away with him-.&#xD;
upset the wagon he was riding in, and he fell--"&#xD;
"I know it all, Miss Heath. It was my fault."&#xD;
"Your fault," repeated Edna with surprise.&#xD;
"My fault, I regret to say. But please forgive&#xD;
me. I came to explain and apologize. Your&#xD;
brother provoked me, and-I was carried away by&#xD;
anger. Had the consequences been serious, I&#xD;
should never have forgiven myself. I am sorry&#xD;
-very sorry, Miss Heath. You were so kind as&#xD;
to take my part on a former occasion, when we&#xD;
were children. I have never forgotten it. (Edna&#xD;
colored at the reminder.) Please do so again. I&#xD;
know you are too just and too kind to blame me,&#xD;
if you knew all the circumstances."&#xD;
Edna, who knew nothing of Mark's share in.&#xD;
the misadventure, was much mystified by his ap-&#xD;
peal, and rather confused by his demeanor; for&#xD;
emboldened by the opportunity, the young man&#xD;
&#xD;
had advanced towards her in a supplicatory atti-&#xD;
tude, while his gaze expressed far more of admi-&#xD;
ration than contrition. She stood with a light&#xD;
blush tinting her features, not knowing how to&#xD;
receive so demonstrative an address, when, fortu-&#xD;
nately, the appearance of her father permitted&#xD;
her to withdraw, and caused her admirer suddenly&#xD;
to subdue his rather dramatic manner.&#xD;
" This is-Mr. George Gildersleeve's brother,&#xD;
if I am not mistaken," quoth Mr. Heath with&#xD;
easy condescension, and extending a finger to&#xD;
Mark.&#xD;
"Yes, sir," replied the young man. "I came&#xD;
to inquire about your son, feeling it my duty to&#xD;
do so."&#xD;
"Better this morning-much better, in fact."&#xD;
" So I was glad to learn from Miss Heath. It&#xD;
is but proper that I should tell you, sir, that I was&#xD;
unfortunately the cause of the- accident," said&#xD;
Mark.&#xD;
"Indeed-indeed," said Mr. Heath loftily, "I&#xD;
wasn't aware."&#xD;
This was a fib, for he knew all about the affair,&#xD;
and that his son had been the aggressor.&#xD;

planation that might be required, or to do any-&#xD;
thing in my power to-"&#xD;
"None is needed, sir; none is needed. The&#xD;
matter is fortunately'of no consequence," inter-&#xD;
rupted Mr. Heath, who was not desirous of discuss-&#xD;
ing the unpleasant event, for he was vexed and&#xD;
somewhat ashamed at this fresh exhibition of his&#xD;
son's misconduct. "I am obliged to you for call-&#xD;
ing, and can safely say, that my son has no grave&#xD;
injury whatever-none whatever."&#xD;
Mr. Heath had not asked his. visitor to be.&#xD;
seated, and as he paused in a significant way after&#xD;
every sentence he uttered, Mark took the hint and&#xD;
his departure.&#xD;
Seldom had Mark been s6 happy as after this&#xD;
visit. The effect of the frigid, almost discourte-&#xD;
ous reception given him by the father, was com-&#xD;
pletely effaced by his short but delightful inter-&#xD;
view with the daughter. To be near her, and to&#xD;
converse with her, was compensation enough for&#xD;
any annoyance. IVioreover, he had discovered to&#xD;
his joy, that while he had fancied himself almost&#xD;
forgotten and unthought of, she had on the con-&#xD;
trary recognized him as an old friend, and even&#xD;
remembered the occasion, long since passed, when&#xD;

&#xD;
she had assumed with childish frankness the part&#xD;
of his ally and defender, The bitter side of that&#xD;
incident faded away for the moment, and his&#xD;
happiness was unalloyed. He cared little for the&#xD;
opinion of father or brother. Marriage with&#xD;
Miss Heath had not yet entered the scope of his&#xD;
aspirations. His aim was to acquire her close&#xD;
friendship, and above all her esteem and admira-&#xD;
tion. For this he resolved to live and strive. A&#xD;
modest ambition truly, but might not friendship,&#xD;
esteem, and admiration blossom into love?. And&#xD;
to that complexion also, were not Edna's feelings,&#xD;
insensibly perhaps, tending ? For it was not from&#xD;
any sense of displeasure that she withdrew so&#xD;
summarily from Mark's presence; on the con-&#xD;
trary, she carried away a very agreeable impres-&#xD;
sion of him; so much so, that his pleading face in-&#xD;
voluntarily presented itself to her repeatedly dur-&#xD;
ing the day. " I never before noticed," thought&#xD;
she, "how much better looking Mark Gildersleeve&#xD;
has grown to be. He certainly has beautiful eyes&#xD;
--so very expressive, and such pleasing manners,&#xD;
and there is something so gentlemanly and refined&#xD;
about him too." Evidently, the hoodwinked ar-&#xD;
cher-boy had sped a shaft in her direction.&#xD;

Mark, certainly, had made the most of his op-&#xD;
portunity. Casting aside all his usual reserve,&#xD;
he had thrown as much eloquence and magnetism&#xD;
as he could, in a pair of black eyes that proved&#xD;
to be not ineffective. At least the ice was broken.&#xD;
But after the first moment of elation had passed,&#xD;
came the disturbing idea of the obstacles he&#xD;
might have to-encounter in the way of future suc-&#xD;
cess. As has been mentioned, he only desired&#xD;
such as he might win through personal distinction.&#xD;
Doubtless there was a large share of vanity in&#xD;
this determination; but vanity was the weak side&#xD;
of the Gildersleeves, half-redeemed, though, in&#xD;
Mark, as it never manifested itself in any offen-&#xD;
sive way.. In social standing, he was not consid-&#xD;
ered the equar of Miss Heath; for in our, republic,&#xD;
gradations in society are as sharply defined as&#xD;
elsewhere, with the difference that with us wealth&#xD;
more frequently draws the line. Mark ignder-&#xD;
stood this, but such was his contempt for mere&#xD;
money-getting, that the enthusiastic youth would&#xD;
even have preferred to resigrn any attempt to gain&#xD;
Miss Heath's favor, if to accomplish it the acqui-&#xD;
sition of wealth were necessary. His estimate of&#xD;
the young lady's character, however, was too high&#xD;
&#xD;
to admit for a moment of the supposition that she&#xD;
could in any way be influenced by mercenary&#xD;
motives. No money could buy what he aspired to&#xD;
possess-to wit, her admiration. Fame alone&#xD;
could win that; and were this the age of chivalry,&#xD;
how eagerly would he don casque, mount the&#xD;
barbed steed, and tilt his way to death or distinc-&#xD;
tion! But in this prosaic age few paths are open&#xD;
to ambitious youth. He was a draughtsman--&#xD;
an engineer. Howsoever eminent one might be-&#xD;
come in that profession, it still remained a com-&#xD;
monplace one. He did not think Edna had any&#xD;
especial admiration for Brunel, or Stephenson, or&#xD;
even Watt. In his calling genius itself could&#xD;
hardly efface the stains of labor, and obtain the&#xD;
consideration accorded to mediocrity in the gen-&#xD;
teel professions. In medicine, or law, one might&#xD;
with far more facility attain celebrity ; but he had&#xD;
no taste for those vocations. He had dabbled&#xD;
with paint, and executed some very indifferent&#xD;
daubs, until in disgust he had thrown away the&#xD;
palette and brush. Then the versatile youth had&#xD;
coquetted with Euterpe, and practised on every&#xD;
instrument, from the harmonica to. the organ. In&#xD;
vocal music he was more successful; but poesy,&#xD;

the art of all arts, was the one he longed to cul-&#xD;
tivate and excel in. He loved the poets, and&#xD;
believed himself animated with a spark of their&#xD;
celestial fire. If genius were patience, why&#xD;
might one not become by constant effort, if not&#xD;
a Shakespeare, say a Keats, or a Tennyson?&#xD;
Phrenologists taught that every faculty could&#xD;
be modified,' and its power increased by exercise.&#xD;
Knatchbull, a foreman in the Works, who had&#xD;
been a Chartist in his own country, and pos-&#xD;
sessed a remarkable head, told him that he&#xD;
had succeeded, under the advice of a phrenol-&#xD;
ogist, in so changing his character that plaster&#xD;
casts of his cranium taken at different periods&#xD;
showed corresponding modifications in the prom-&#xD;
inences. This practical example of what per-&#xD;
sistence might do was encouraging; and so Mark,&#xD;
stung by some stray bee from Mount ilymettus,&#xD;
wrote quires of plain verses, which he thought&#xD;
very fine and destined to stir the world of letters,&#xD;
but which were simply transpositions of ideas and&#xD;
similes of the master poets with which his mind&#xD;
was saturated.&#xD;

as its low thunder lulled him into delicious day&#xD;
dreams. Far into the night would he linger re-&#xD;
clining against the bole of some tree, gazing with&#xD;
straining eyes towards Mr. Heath's villa, whose'&#xD;
gray walls loomed in the moonlight like a feudal&#xD;
castle, to catch, perhaps, a glimpse of a shadow&#xD;
that might appear occasionally behind the cur-&#xD;
tains of a lighted room that he knew to be&#xD;
Edna's. Often had the faint sound of music or&#xD;
mirth, that reached him from the open drawing-&#xD;
room windows, filled himwith envy and jealousy,&#xD;
as he thought of the Rev. Spencer Abbott and&#xD;
young Mumbie, who were constant visitors- at the&#xD;
villa. Then, dismally homeward would he wend&#xD;
his way, go to his' room, and spend the silent&#xD;

&#xD;
watches of the night racking his brains to com'&#xD;
mit his thoughts to paper. Quires, nay reams,&#xD;
were covered with superfine tropes and meta-&#xD;
phors, as he strove to coin words that the world&#xD;
would not willingly let die. He ventured to&#xD;
show his lucubrations to Dr. Wattletop, but the&#xD;
reception they met with was neither flattering nor&#xD;
even encouraging. "My dear boy, drop all this,"&#xD;
was the advice given. "Not only are you wasting&#xD;
precious time, but your taste and mind are be-&#xD;
coming vitiated by the namby-pamby trash of&#xD;
modern.rhymesters. If you must plagiarize, do&#xD;
it from Pope, or Milton, or Gray. Study them,&#xD;
or the master Shakespeare. Remember, as Cole-&#xD;
ridge said, poetry must be either music or sense,&#xD;
and I cannot say there is much of either in your&#xD;
verses. Get at the kernel. But after all, the&#xD;
study for a poetically inclined youth is medicine,&#xD;
singular as that may seem to you. If the desire&#xD;
be to awaken sublime ideas, investigate the ab-&#xD;
struse problem of life. Follow the noblest call-&#xD;
ing, the art of healing, and seek to penetrate the&#xD;
arcana of Nature. I wish I could induce you to&#xD;
become one of us. Our. profession greatly needs&#xD;
ardent and intelligent recruits, else we shall be&#xD;
&#xD;
overrun with quacks in every shape. Look at&#xD;
the frightful progress of that modern humbug,&#xD;
homoeopathy. There is no error, however absurd,&#xD;
but will find supporters and disciples, and no&#xD;
where can there be a nobler field for the exercise&#xD;
of the highest talent than in combating and&#xD;
routing those egregious and pernicious pre-&#xD;
tenders to science, who, with the absurd brocard,&#xD;
that 'like cures like,' impose on the simple and&#xD;
gullible. Now I am anything but illiberal-if&#xD;
anything, I err on the opposite side. Whatever&#xD;
my convictions may be, I am willing to give a&#xD;
patient hearing and investigation to any theory&#xD;
or system bearing a show of probability, that is&#xD;
advanced in a truthful, earnest, and humble&#xD;
spirit. I do not forget that alchemy was the&#xD;
mother of chemistry, and astrology of astronomy;&#xD;
that Harvey met with bigoted opposition, and in&#xD;
short that it becomes the seeker to be humble;&#xD;
but when I see a fellow like this Keene here-&#xD;
this hatchet-faced Yankee from Connecticut, who&#xD;
probably a year ago was peddling wooden clocks,&#xD;
going around Beiton with his ridiculous pellets,&#xD;
and presuming to be a physician, I am provoked&#xD;
beyond endurance, and feel sometimes as if I&#xD;

could give the fellow a horse-whipping. Well,&#xD;
well, the fools are not all dead yet."&#xD;
"II hope, doctor, you don't class me among&#xD;
them," said crestfallen Mark, with a feeble&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"No-no-my dear boy," replied the doctor,&#xD;
patting his protegd affectionately on the shoulder.&#xD;
"Not by any means. I was merely alluding to the&#xD;
facility with which the generous public is gulled.&#xD;
As for you, Mark, I think there is the stuff in&#xD;
you for something, if not for a bard. I dislike&#xD;
to see you chasing jack-o'-lanterns. Think of it;&#xD;
there are but a certain quantity of poetic ideas,.&#xD;
and they have all been thought out and put into&#xD;
English words long ago. Fresh attempts result&#xD;
only in tricking them out in fantastic dresses,&#xD;
and with poor effect. Modern critics may sneer&#xD;
at the old favorites, but what have your rhyme-&#xD;
sters of to-day produced equal to the 'Universal&#xD;
Prayer,' ' Gray's Elegy,' or 'The Deserted Vil--&#xD;
lage'? No, no, lad; love the old poets, from&#xD;
Homer down, but don't attempt to soar with&#xD;
them to the empyrean. Stay with us on terra&#xD;
firma; invent a new cut-off, or condenser, and&#xD;
let anapest, dactyl, and trochee alone."&#xD;
&#xD;
This advice was not relished by Mark, and&#xD;
like most distasteful advice, was not followed;&#xD;
if anything, it proved a spur to his literary exer-&#xD;
tions.   Occasionally his    effusions found   their&#xD;
way into print, and shone in the Literary column&#xD;
of the Belton Sentinel, accompanied by a notice&#xD;
from the editor, who alluded -to the talent of his&#xD;
young fellow-townsman in terms of unmeasured&#xD;
praise. Said that influential sheet on the appear-&#xD;
ance of The Broken Alacus:&#xD;
In spite of a press of matter, we determined to make&#xD;
room, in our issue of to-day, for another poem from the pen&#xD;
of our gifted young poet, Mark Gildersleeve, which will be&#xD;
found on the third page. The favor with which the&#xD;
'withered Chaplet' and 'The Spear of Ithuriel' were&#xD;
received, encourage us to print the present verses. They&#xD;
are hexameters, and remind us in their flowing rhythm of&#xD;
the earlier efforts of Longfellow, while in gorgeousness of&#xD;
imagery and luxuriance of diction, they equal some of the&#xD;
finest passages in Keats. Altogether, we congratulate Mr.&#xD;
Gildersleeve on this exquisite production, whose symmetry&#xD;
and polished beauty can only be fitly compared to a capital&#xD;
of Pentelican marble from the chisel of Phidias."&#xD;
Dr. Wattletop, though, said "Bosh" to this,&#xD;
when he read it, and it could not be denied&#xD;
that he was a competent critic. Ile, also, had&#xD;
trod. the primrose path of literature in leisure&#xD;

tribtutor of essays to magazines and reviews.&#xD;
There was a literary club in Belton, composed of&#xD;
young men who loved to indulge in debates and&#xD;
other intellectual gymnastics. Mark, as might be&#xD;
supposed, was an active member, and, indeed, at&#xD;
one time president of this association. Besides&#xD;
deciding the momentous topics of "Whether&#xD;
men of thought, or men of action, have done the&#xD;
most for civilization," or "Whether the execu-&#xD;
tion of Mary Queen of, Scots was justifiable or&#xD;
not," and other questions of similar perplexity,&#xD;
the society gave lectures, or rather lectures were&#xD;
given, to quote the posters, under their auspices,&#xD;
during the winter months. At their solicitation,&#xD;
Dr. Wattletop was induced to prepare and -de-&#xD;
liver a lecture on "Eccentricity," a theme which&#xD;
he was well qualified, at least from experience,&#xD;
to treat of. ile diversified it with many humor-&#xD;
ous anecdotes of Porson and Abernethy, and it&#xD;
met with much applause, and elicited very flat-&#xD;
tering encomiums from the Belton Sentinel. So&#xD;
successful, indeed, was it, that efforts were made&#xD;
to have the doctor repeat it in neighboring&#xD;
towns, but he excused himself on the plea of&#xD;
want of time. Then proffers of money were&#xD;
&#xD;
made to induce him to comply; this only served&#xD;
to incense him, and an indignant refusal was the&#xD;
result. He was inclined to blame Mark a little&#xD;
in his, displeasure.&#xD;
"Mark, you rascal, all this is your fault. I&#xD;
never would have given that confounded lect-&#xD;
ure but for you. It ill becomes a man of my&#xD;
years and profession to waste the time he owes to&#xD;
his patients, in relating stale jests to a grinning&#xD;
audience. I don't know what I could have been&#xD;
thipking of. In future, spin your nonsense as&#xD;
much as you like, my boy, but don't ask me to&#xD;
join you-at my age, too ! My remnant of life&#xD;
is too short, and time has become too precious to&#xD;
me, to be squandered in that way."&#xD;
As well in that way, and better than in an-&#xD;
other he was prone to; and 'unfortunately, he&#xD;
was getting.rather too much on his hands, just&#xD;
then, of the article he deemed so precious. For&#xD;
Keene, the hatchet-faced honxopath, had relieved&#xD;
the doctor of a vast deal of practice, and left him&#xD;
with overmuch unemployed time on his hands.&#xD;
Dr. Wattletop explained the increasing popular..&#xD;

would letake himself to a walk, which, after a cir-&#xD;

to what the Belton "Band of Hope" would have&#xD;
designated as half way to it, viz.: "The Shades."&#xD;
This was a little tavern at the far' end of the&#xD;

with fine engravings of the All England Eleven&#xD;

was   6 " Brummagem" man, suspected, from his&#xD;
blunted nose, of having been a pugilist, but as he&#xD;
was a surly man of uncommunicative disposition,&#xD;
the suspicion had never been verified. There were&#xD;
a half-dozen tables in the room, and at a partic-&#xD;

and Dagon his (beneath the table), with undeviat&#xD;

prevented by professional duties. Mutely, then,&#xD;
the blunt-nosed man brought a beaker of gin and&#xD;

gin and perused the paper, his interest in the lat-&#xD;

Colonel Sabretasche retired, or that the .-th&#xD;

and imposing, sitting bolt upright with his cane&#xD;
between his knees, and gazing in a very\uncom-&#xD;
romising way into vacancy, The scot settled&#xD;
without exchanging a word, the doctor buttoned&#xD;
his coat tightly, grasped his canie firmly, and&#xD;
sternly began his return homeward. His way led&#xD;
the length of Main Street, and seldom was any&#xD;
one bold enough to accost him then.&#xD;
Once, at such a time, Mr. Mumbie crossed his&#xD;
path (it was shortly after the delivery of the doc-&#xD;
tor's lecture on Eccentricity), and ventured to&#xD;
greet him with a smile and extended hand :&#xD;
"Good-day, doctor."&#xD;
" Sir to you," replied the doctor, halting in a&#xD;
military attitude.&#xD;
" Fine afternoon, doctor."&#xD;
"Very fine indeed, sir. Ha ! very fine."&#xD;
" Doctor, you'd hardly believe it, but to-day is&#xD;
my birthday," said Mr. Mumble, assuming a tri-&#xD;
umphant air as if he were imparting a surprising&#xD;
piece of news.&#xD;
"I see no reason to doubt it," replied the doc-&#xD;
tor, curtly.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, that is so," rejoined Mr. Mumbie&#xD;
&#xD;
with decisionI; "'m a much older man, let me tell&#xD;
you, than you take me for."&#xD;
Dr. Wattletop looked as if he were prepared&#xD;
to take Mr. Mumbie for any age whatever, for&#xD;
that gentleman presented what might be styled an&#xD;
anachronistic appearance. He was a large man,&#xD;
offering at first view a protuberant expanse of&#xD;
waistcoat, supported by somewhat unstable legs.&#xD;
His head was an oblong one, covered with a curly&#xD;
glossy brown wig, that contrasted singularly with&#xD;
thick gray eyebrows, and dyed whiskers on flabby&#xD;
cheeks flanked by two large ears.&#xD;
"Yes, sir," repeated Mr. Mumbie, "I'm a much&#xD;
older man than you take me for. .You know Mrs.&#xD;
Mumbie is much my junior, and that I never&#xD;
made up my mind to marry until late in life-.&#xD;
that accounts for it."&#xD;
"Accounts for what ? " inquired the doctor, be-&#xD;
ginning to be bored.&#xD;
Accounts for the-the discrepancy I spoke&#xD;
of. Now, here's a knife," and Mr. Mumbie.&#xD;
drew from his'pocket a jack-knife, the bone-&#xD;
handle of which was yellow with age, "here's&#xD;

day present. Just notice the date I scratched&#xD;
StNov. 16th, 1814. Just think of&#xD;
on the handle-  v&#xD;
that. I've carried it for going on fifty years-yes,&#xD;
'  JQir, fifty years. I doubt if there many men, or mn&#xD;
any man, can say as much; and what changes&#xD;
taken place since then! But I'm a man of&#xD;
ng local attachments. Ihad an umbrella, doc-&#xD;
o , when I was first married that I had used&#xD;
steadily for twenty-six years-think of that! I&#xD;
suppose I would have had it yet, but Mrs. Mumbie,&#xD;
unfortunately, was prejudiced against thatum-a&#xD;
brella, and one day it disappeared. I never saw&#xD;
it again." This was said solemnly, and Mr.&#xD;
Mumbie looked as if he were about to pay the&#xD;
tribute of a tear to the manes of the departed&#xD;
umbrella.&#xD;
The doctor's patience becoming weary, he was&#xD;
about to turn on his heel to leave, when Mr.&#xD;
Mumbie resumed:&#xD;
"Doctor, I ought to thank you for the pleas-&#xD;
ure you afforded me the other evening. I haven't&#xD;
had such a treat in a long time. 'Pears to me&#xD;
you might make lots o' money going about deliv-&#xD;
ering that lecture. It was capital. You did get&#xD;
off some of the funniest anecdotes I ever heard,&#xD;
&#xD;
MARK GILDERSLEEVE.          101&#xD;
and I assure you I was really very much enter&#xD;
tamed "&#xD;
" Entertained, sir ! Dammit, sir, do you take&#xD;
me for a mountebank? " exclaimed the doctor,&#xD;
swelling with rising indignation.&#xD;
It required very many apologies and explana-&#xD;
tions on Mr. Mumbie's part to allay the ire of the&#xD;
physician, who continued, after parting with his&#xD;
interlocutor, to mutter to himself as he went&#xD;
along: "Entertained him! Am I, Basil Wattle-&#xD;
top, a buffoon ? Does he attempt to patronize&#xD;
me ? The insolence of these Yankee upstarts is&#xD;
really something perfectly amazing ! It's almost&#xD;
beyond belief."  Unfortunately, his dignity that&#xD;
day was destined to be subjected to further ruf-&#xD;
fling, for as he neared the Archimedes Works he&#xD;
caught sight of the proprietor thereof, who was&#xD;
loungingas usual on the door-step of his "office,"&#xD;
with his hands in his pockets. No man, we will&#xD;
venture to say, that kept his hands as often pock-&#xD;
eted, ever earned so much money as George Gil-&#xD;
dersleeve; but if his hands were idle, his eyes&#xD;
were, busy and everywhere. A   more vigilant&#xD;
pair of optics never lodged in a human head.&#xD;
"Now, that fellow," soliloquized the doctor, allud-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7700-00000051"/>&#xD;
ing to George,"has sense enough to know that&#xD;
he springs from the lees. He don't attempt to&#xD;
ape his betters or to patronize them, and his rude-&#xD;
ness and ignorance are far less offensive than the&#xD;
insufferable pretensions of that snob Mumbie-&#xD;
"Hold up, Major," broke in George, hailing the&#xD;
doctor stentoriously. "Step over here a moment.&#xD;
Foreman of my finishing-shop split his thumb&#xD;
to-day in a lathe, and I want you to look at it."&#xD;
The doctor was in doubts whether to respond&#xD;
to an appeal so unceremoniously conveyed. He&#xD;
decided, however, after a short debate with him-&#xD;
self, to cross over to the counting-room and ex-&#xD;
amine the injured man. The hurt being dressed&#xD;
and pronounced but a slight affair, he was about&#xD;
to leave when George Gildersleeve must needs&#xD;
engage him in a discussion, which gradually&#xD;
drifted into the delicate subject of the compara-&#xD;
tive merits of Englishmen and Americans. At&#xD;
this time there were sputterings in Congress, and&#xD;
in the newspapers, in regard to a fresh "outrage"&#xD;
perpetrated by the navy of Great Britain on our&#xD;
flag, and the general expression was that we were&#xD;
not " going to stand i&#xD;
&#xD;
MARK GILDERSLEEVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
103&#xD;
&#xD;
George fdr his part certainly vas not, and said&#xD;
so plainly: "Look here, Major, do you see that ?"&#xD;
(pointing to an old horse-shoe nailed over the fire-&#xD;
place.) "Right here was my grandfather's forge,&#xD;
and right about here's where he shod ,Gineral&#xD;
Washington's horse just awhile afore he fought&#xD;
the great battle of Trenton, and that's one of&#xD;
the cast-off shoes, and I wouldn't take a thousand&#xD;
dollars for it. Well, sir, the man that rode that&#xD;
horse that my grandfather shod, faxed you Eng-&#xD;
lishmen out of your boots; and I tell you we've&#xD;
plenty more that can do it now, and they'll do it&#xD;
again, if you Johnny Bulls don't behave your-&#xD;
selves; now mind."&#xD;
Dr. Wattletop, being in that condition when&#xD;
he was excessively patriotic, prejudiced, and punc-&#xD;
tilious, was so utterly dunbfoundered by this&#xD;
tirade, that for a moment apoplexy was immi-&#xD;
nent. Luckily, contempt supervened, and with a&#xD;
smile of scorn and withering irony, he repeated,&#xD;
"Washington-Trenton-great battle of Trenton,&#xD;
I believe you said? Do you seriously call that a&#xD;
battle? Why, my man, do you know what a&#xD;
battle is? At the so-called battle of Trenton the&#xD;

statements are evidently grossly exaggerated-the&#xD;
total loss in killed on both sides amounted to five-&#xD;
and-twenty, including a drummer, who received a'&#xD;
black eye in the shindy ; five-and-twenty killed!&#xD;
all told-all told!"&#xD;
George Gildersleeve shook his head incredu-&#xD;
lously at this statement, and the doctor continued:&#xD;
"Now, if you will take the trouble to instruct&#xD;
yourself a bit, you will find out what Englishmen&#xD;
can do. Read, for instance, an account of the battle&#xD;
of Waterloo. Talk of Homeric heroes! What's&#xD;
Achilles and the well-greaved Greeks to the Iron&#xD;
Duke and the Guards ?-what's Ajax Telamon to&#xD;
Shaw the Life-guardsman ? tell me that-tell me&#xD;
that ?" Shaw the Life-guardsman was the doc-&#xD;
tor's favorite hero, and he never failed, when the&#xD;
occasion offered, to bring him in as the compeer&#xD;
of all the paladins of old, from Hector to Roland.&#xD;
" Ah! there was fighting such as the world&#xD;
ne'er saw before," continued the doctor, kindling&#xD;
with enthusiasm. "Not the famous Macedonian&#xD;
phalanx nor the Roman legion held their ground&#xD;
so stoutly as the squares of British linesmen when&#xD;
the steel-clad squadrons of cuirassiers broke&#xD;
against them in vain."&#xD;
&#xD;
" That was all very well when you fought them&#xD;
Frenchmen and Greeks. But when you tackled&#xD;
us, you found a different sort of people to deal&#xD;
with, I reckon. Old Put, and Jackson, and&#xD;
Gineral Scott, were too much for you, old man,"&#xD;
returned George, with a shake of the head that&#xD;
ought to have settled matters.&#xD;
Dr. Wattletop's nose glowed with a fiercer heat,&#xD;
and if looks could have scorched a man, Gilder-&#xD;
sleeve would have shrivelled on the spot; but the&#xD;
chances are that even the glances of that pleasant&#xD;
dame Medusa would have fallen harmless on&#xD;
the pachydermatous master of the Archimedes&#xD;
works.&#xD;
" Why, confound it, man, you talk like an ass.&#xD;
Should her Gracious Majesty, the Queen of Eng-&#xD;
land, ever deign to notice the vaporings of your&#xD;
politicians, and take it into her head to resent&#xD;
them, she'd send the Channel fleet over here and&#xD;
knock your blasted country into finders in no&#xD;
time, and dammit, I wish she would-!" and with&#xD;
that volley the doctor turned on his heel, and left&#xD;
abruptly, to work off his choler by an additional&#xD;
tramp of a mile or two.&#xD;

"How are you to convince a pig headed, obsti-&#xD;

WrnLE all the efforts of man, long-repeated, to&#xD;
change the baser metals into gold have proved fu-&#xD;
tile, it is no less certain that gold, in revenge, has&#xD;
been successful in transmuting man. The power&#xD;
of its moral alchemy is seen in individuals like&#xD;
Rufus Heath. Poor, he would have remained a&#xD;
fawning toady, but wealth transformed him into a&#xD;
haughty, arrogant aristocrat at heart. No Sorer-&#xD;
set or Rohan was ever more so. Starting in life&#xD;
without other capital than a moderate education,&#xD;
tact, and industry, his first aim was to acquire&#xD;
wealth. His tastes were luxurious and refined,&#xD;
and to gratify them wealth was necessary. So&#xD;
to succeed he was plastic and serviceable to his&#xD;
employers, and assiduous in courting useful&#xD;
friends. A good name is a great stepping-&#xD;
stone, and to secure this he was correct and re-&#xD;
spectable in his conduct and demeanor. "Cor-&#xD;
rectness," in fact, was his religion and code of&#xD;
morality. Of course, right and wrong were rela-&#xD;
tive terms, and it was not to be expected that&#xD;

any one should live up to the exact letter of&#xD;
the law. A margin was allowable.&#xD;
Nevertheless, decorum and all outward observ-&#xD;

Acting.on this principle, there was no more popu-&#xD;

Belton, than Rufus Heath, nor one with brighter&#xD;
prospects. Counsellor Hull, his patron, declared&#xD;
that the young lawyer promised to be an orna-&#xD;
ment to the profession ; and when the Counsellor&#xD;
was called to the bench, Rufus Heath succeeded&#xD;
to his practice. Exempt from gross vices, and gift-&#xD;
ed with an elastic conscience, the thriving lawyer&#xD;
successfully pursued his calling, until his marriage&#xD;
with Miss Obershaw crowned his pecuniary pro-&#xD;
sperity. Now the influence of riches made itself&#xD;
manifest, and it almost seemed as if the precious&#xD;
metals had been injected into his veins. He stiff-&#xD;
ened, became cold and imperturbable, laid aside&#xD;
his urbanity, and his ill-concealed pride and con-&#xD;
tempt for the less prosperous betrayed itself.&#xD;
And now that he had tasted all the joys that&#xD;
affluence can give, and tasted them unto satiety,&#xD;
he craved the flattering unction of distinction.&#xD;
Ambition was now his god. He was a politician,&#xD;
&#xD;
"I&#xD;
&#xD;
but a successful one only so far as he had been&#xD;
assisted by his wealth aid family connections.&#xD;
He owed it to these powerful auxiliaries that&#xD;
he had spent a term in Congress. But he had&#xD;
gained no prominence there. He lacked ora-&#xD;
torical ability, and without it, it is scarcely&#xD;
possible to attain eminence in a republic. His&#xD;
daintiness, moreover, caused him to recoil from&#xD;
contact with the masses, and though he strove&#xD;
to overcome this repugnance when the occa-&#xD;
sion called for it, he had never entirely succeed-&#xD;
ed. Perseverance, intrigue, and a lavish expen-&#xD;
diture of money, were the reans he relied on&#xD;
to ascend the first steps of political preferment.&#xD;
Once fairly launched as a public man, he doubted&#xD;
not his ability to make his way and mark as a&#xD;
statesman or a diplomat. To become Governor&#xD;
of his State was his present aim, and he had laid&#xD;
his plans to secure the nomination from his party&#xD;
as a candidate at the next election. To this end&#xD;
a host of emissaries, with money at command,&#xD;
were at work throughout the State.. The Belton&#xD;
&amp;amp;ntinel, the organ in the county of Mr. Heath's&#xD;
party, advocated his interest with tremendous&#xD;
energy, persistency, and abundance of adjectives.&#xD;

Finnegass, the editor, was a poor printer, whose&#xD;
shop, presses, types, and all were mortgaged to&#xD;
Rufus Heath. This well-known fact furnished&#xD;
an unfailing quantity of sarcasm to the Passaic&#xD;
County Argus, the opposition sheet, that invari-&#xD;
ably alluded to Finnegass as the "minion" or&#xD;
"serf," either "pampered " or" truckling," of the&#xD;
"aristocrat on the cliff."  These amenities were&#xD;
treated by the editor of the Sentinel with com-&#xD;
plete indifference, until once (stung into retortig&#xD;
by some particularly sharp gibe) he referred to&#xD;
the Argus as an "obscure sheet of no circulation,&#xD;
edited by a low, ignorant felon." Obscurity and&#xD;
"no circulation " were accusations too atrocious&#xD;
to be borne, and the editor of the Argus flung&#xD;
them back, with indignation, in the teeth of his&#xD;
defamer. This brought out sworn statements of&#xD;
copies issued by the two presses, and much evi-&#xD;
dence on both sides was published; for the rival&#xD;
editors were ready to go to any lengths to excul-&#xD;
pate their respective papers from so heinous a&#xD;
charge as obscurity or want of "circulation."&#xD;
As for the personalities, they were treated as mild&#xD;
banter, tending to enliven the canvass, and stimu-&#xD;
late partisans.&#xD;

At this time, to quote the after-words of the,&#xD;
Belton Sentinel, "the horizon of. political affairs&#xD;
was darkening, and the clouds that confined the&#xD;
storm destined to shake the fabric of our Union&#xD;
to its foundation, were gathering ominously."&#xD;
The different parties were in a ferment. The&#xD;
Whigs no longer existed-they had given way to&#xD;
an organization originated by the Free-Soilers,&#xD;
and styling themselves Republicans.. There were,&#xD;
however, a large number of old Whigs wedded&#xD;
to their prejudices, with a distaste for affiliation&#xD;
with the Democrats and a greater repugnance to&#xD;
a party tainted in any degree with Abolitionism,&#xD;
who looked upon the new movement as an ephem-&#xD;
eral ebullition. These individuals, calling them-&#xD;
selves "Conservatives," imagined that it required&#xD;
but an effort on their part to still the waters of&#xD;
political strife, and decided to constitute them-&#xD;
selves "bulwarks," and " arks of safety." Among&#xD;
these was the Hon. Rufus Heath. Like- all men&#xD;
of his stamp, he was utterly opposed to any dis-&#xD;
turbance of the established order of things.. He&#xD;
was perfectly well satisfied with them as they&#xD;
were. As for radicals or reformers, he hated&#xD;
their very name. - Such people sprang from the&#xD;

lgar herd, and were only bent on mischief.&#xD;
uis ideal of a proper government was a constitu-&#xD;
tional monarchy supported by an oligarchy of&#xD;
wealthand to this form he believed the republic&#xD;
was radally tending. He was not unobservantt&#xD;
of the increasing prestige of birth. Position in&#xD;
the army navy, or state was gradually tending to&#xD;
perpetuate itself in certain families. The bearers&#xD;
of historic names wielded a certain influence,&#xD;
which increased with time, and would eventually&#xD;
ard under certain circumstances crystallize into&#xD;
decided power. Here were the germs of an&#xD;
oligarchy, which needed but a law of entail to&#xD;
perfect itself and institute a class of hereditary&#xD;
legislators, or house of pesh    blak-&#xD;
dispensable against the agrarianism inherent in a&#xD;
democratic form of government.&#xD;
In order to exchange views on the condition of&#xD;
the body-politic, and devise means to combat the&#xD;
evil influences then prevailing (to say nothing of&#xD;
advancing his own personal plans), Mr. Heath&#xD;
took advantage of the presence in the vicinity of a&#xD;
statesman who had occupied a very exalted po-&#xD;
sition in the commonwealth, to ask him to meet&#xD;
&#xD;
at dinner, sundry other influential and distin-&#xD;
guished citizens, and confer on the important&#xD;
subjects mii question.&#xD;
The preliminary step was to send for Mr.&#xD;
Mumbie. Mr. Heath bad an imperial way of&#xD;
summoning people to him, and his mandates&#xD;
were generally obeyed with alacrity-always so&#xD;
when addressed to his good old neighbor and&#xD;
'toady, Mumbie; who, although suffering from an&#xD;
attack of rheumatic gout, hobbled as quickly as&#xD;
his swollen feet would permit him, in prompt re-&#xD;
sponse to the call.&#xD;
"Mumbie," said Mr. Heath, "I suppose you&#xD;
have heard that there is a great deal of talk&#xD;
about my running for Governor at the next&#xD;
election?"&#xD;
Mr. Mumbie had not heard of it, nor had any&#xD;
one else ; but he looked and nodded as if it were&#xD;
a familiar and constant topic of conversation with&#xD;
everybody.&#xD;
"well, I have not yet made up my mind&#xD;
whether I will consent to run or not. However,&#xD;
that is neither here nor there at present, nor what&#xD;
I wanted to gee and talk with you about. Sena-&#xD;
tor Rangle is your brother's wife's cousin, I be&#xD;

live, and you are on a familiar footing with him,&#xD;
are you not "&#xD;
" Yes, sir," said Mumbie, listening attentively.&#xD;
" So I thought. Now Rangle and I are not on&#xD;
the very best of terms. He accuses me, I be-&#xD;
lieve, of having used my influence against him&#xD;
in the Legislature, when he sought a renomination&#xD;
-said I wanted the place myself, and so forth.&#xD;
He is mistaken in that. However, I am willing-&#xD;
to pass it over, as this is a time when personal&#xD;
feeling should not interfere to prevent men from&#xD;
acting in accord on vital questions of state.&#xD;
Here is the point. I have asked ex-President&#xD;
to meet Judge Hull at dinner Thursday&#xD;
week. Several other prominent gentlemen will&#xD;
be present, and matters of importance may be&#xD;
discussed. Now, Mumbie, you can assist me in&#xD;
this way: call on Rangle, state to him that as my&#xD;
friend you regret that there should be anydiver~&#xD;
gence of opinion between us; that from your&#xD;
personal-knowledge I have never held any but&#xD;
the highest opinion of him; and so on. You&#xD;
might then introduce the subject of the proposed&#xD;
dinner, and state that you know that I would be&#xD;
pleased to have him make one of the company.&#xD;
&#xD;
MARK GILDERSLEEVE-       115&#xD;
&#xD;
On your report, if everything is satisfactory, I&#xD;
can forward him a formal invitation. Now, my&#xD;
dear Mumbie, you will help me in t-his little&#xD;
matter, and I can rely on your discretion, I&#xD;
know."&#xD;
" Certainly, Mr. Heath, certainly. I shall be&#xD;
delighted to undertake the job;" and Mr. Mum-&#xD;
bie hastened off, big with the importance of his&#xD;
mission, and happy as if he had received an or-&#xD;
der for ten thousand reams of foolscap, paid for&#xD;
in advance. His task was an easy one. The&#xD;
senator was flattered by Mr. Heath's advances,&#xD;
and in no way averse to partake of his dinners,&#xD;
whose celebrity had reached him; moreover, in&#xD;
no way disinclined to forego the opportunity of&#xD;
meeting ex-President    , whose political star&#xD;
seemed to glimmer forth again in the.ascendant.&#xD;
It is almost superfluous to mention, that the&#xD;
dinner was all that could be expected, for what-&#xD;
ever Mr. Heath's other qualities may have been,&#xD;
good taste he unquestionably possessed, and in&#xD;
the important matter of dinner-giving he was&#xD;
behind no one. -And when it is considered how&#xD;
important a part that art has displayed in di-&#xD;
Plomacy, it could not be denied that his aspira-&#xD;
&#xD;

MAI  LESJIIV.MARK GILDERSLEBYE&#xD;
&#xD;
lions to shine in that career were not by any&#xD;
means presumptuous. An opinion, it is safe to&#xD;
say, that would have been heartily indorsed by&#xD;
all who were fortunate enough to partake of the&#xD;
memorable repast. Perhaps a little less starched&#xD;
ceremony on thepart of the host would not have&#xD;
been amiss; still, that was more than compensated&#xD;
by the quality of the mewu. As usual on such&#xD;
extraordinary occasions, an eminent chef from the&#xD;
metropolis directed the culinary operations, and&#xD;
many bottles of old South Side Madeira and&#xD;
choice Hermitage, that had lain for years in dusty&#xD;
racks, were brought to light, and decanted for&#xD;
the delectation of appreciative palates; such a pal-&#xD;
ate, for instance, as a Chief Justice of great legal&#xD;
acumen and good digestion, or a portly ex=Fed-&#xD;
eral dignitary possesses, or even that of a dainty&#xD;
young High-Church ecclesiastic full of zeal and&#xD;
sentiment, like Spencer Abbott. What a fine&#xD;
dinner it was, to be sure! Rather formal and cold,&#xD;
it is true, in the drawing-rooms as the host was&#xD;
'receiving his guests. Mrs. Applegate was flushed&#xD;
and fidgety amid such illustrious visitors, and Mr.&#xD;
Mumbie was ill at ease in his capacious white&#xD;
waistcoat, tight gloves, and freshly dyed whiskers.&#xD;
&#xD;
Such grand company impressed him immensely,&#xD;
and for fear of lapsus lingua, he restricted him-&#xD;
self to monosyllabic replies. The Chief Justice,&#xD;
being hungry, was somewhat surly until dinner&#xD;
was announced, when he ponderously and feebly&#xD;
toddled into the dining-room in advance of the&#xD;
other guests, and regardless of Mr. Heath's inten-&#xD;
tion to have him lead Mrs. Applegate in. This&#xD;
duty therefore devolved on the ex-Federal digni-&#xD;
tary, who did it with much courtly grace. How&#xD;
well the host presided, and how elegant he ap-&#xD;
peared! His stately white neck-tie and glossy&#xD;
gray locks were arranged with a precision that was&#xD;
mathematical, and with his small elegant white&#xD;
hands he looked as if he were descended from a&#xD;
long line of partridge-fed ancestors. A worthy&#xD;
pendant, indeed, to the ex-Federal dignitary,&#xD;
whose proudest boast was that he had been com-&#xD;
plimented by a queen as the most elegant Amer-&#xD;
ican gentleman she had ever seen. What a con-&#xD;
trast the two presented to Judge Hull, with his&#xD;
fell of white hair streaming over his massive&#xD;
head and bent shoulders, his beetling sable&#xD;
brows shading a pair of cavernous eyes, and&#xD;
who always looked as if he were on the bench&#xD;

administering inexorable justice. He certai ly&#xD;
did to the dinner, and it was with dificulty that&#xD;
he could be drawn out by the host, and made&#xD;
to enlighten the company with bits of prodigious&#xD;
wisdom. Finnegass, the editor of the Sentinel,&#xD;
who occupied a seat at the farther end of the&#xD;
table, and expected to gather material for a bril-&#xD;
liant leader from the table-talk of the assembled&#xD;
sages, was greatly disappointed at the common-&#xD;
place style of the conversation.&#xD;
"IHeath, this soup's not so bad," quoth the&#xD;
Judge during a short breathing spell; "I'11l&#xD;
take another plateful. What do you call it?&#xD;
Potage d lct Reine.   Haqenptae eht&#xD;
Well-named, verily. A man might well sell his&#xD;

"Touching the late proceedings in Congress,&#xD;
Judge," edged in Mr. Heath, "you cannot have&#xD;
failed to notice how the breach is gradually wid-&#xD;
ening. There seems to be a disposition on the&#xD;
part of certain members to push matters to ex-&#xD;
tremes, and bring about a rupture at any cost.&#xD;
Don't you think, that an expression of opinion--&#xD;
a decided expression on the part of the higher&#xD;

classes-the respectable and influential part of the&#xD;
community, would go far to-to_-"&#xD;
"This can be arranged and must be," replied&#xD;
the Judge, addressing his plate dogmatically. "The&#xD;
hot-heads of both parties must be made to listen&#xD;
to reason, and the, conservative element of the&#xD;
country should at once take the reins. By the bye,&#xD;
this white Burgundy is the same I've tasted here be-&#xD;
fore, is it not? Yquem, you said ? A good wine-&#xD;
a very good wine. The field has been left entirely&#xD;
too much to the fanatics of the East and the fire-&#xD;
eaters of the South, and to stop the current of dem-&#xD;
agogisminvhich threatens to overwhelm us, we need&#xD;
the best efforts of sound sagacious statesmen like&#xD;
our friend here."&#xD;
The friend referred to by the Judge's fork was&#xD;
the ex-Federal dignitary, who bowed an acknowl-&#xD;
edgment of the flattering allusion, and with a&#xD;
little deprecatory wave of the hand replied, "No&#xD;
doubt-no doubt, Judge, you are quite right. All&#xD;
that is necessary is to bring the best men of the&#xD;
country together to concerted action, and the mat-&#xD;
ter can be settled without any difficulty. But&#xD;
if we hold aloof-if the great legal lights, such&#xD;
gentlemen as yourself or our friend Mr. heath;&#xD;

or the heads of finance, as represented by our&#xD;
friend on my left, Mr. Bawbee; or the master-&#xD;
minds of the manufacturing and industrial inter-&#xD;
ests, such as our friend Mr. Mumbie; in short, if&#xD;
the intellect and wealth and respectability of the&#xD;
nation do not interfere, and continue to permit&#xD;
men like Sumner and Seward to persist in their&#xD;
incendiary leadership, we may-I say it without&#xD;
hesitation and with great regret-we may expect&#xD;
any catastrophe."&#xD;
Mr. Mumble, who had been listening with awe&#xD;
and attention to the words of the great men in&#xD;
whose presence he was, reddened with modest&#xD;
confusion on being designated as a master-mind.&#xD;
He had never taken exactly that view ofihimself,&#xD;
but on reflection, concluded it to be an eminently&#xD;
fit and proper one, and felt that the world had&#xD;
much to answer for in having so greatly under-&#xD;
rated him hitherto. " I quite agree with you. I&#xD;
do indeed, sir. Your remarks are very correct, sir;&#xD;
very correct indeed, I assure you, sir," spoke he,&#xD;
feeling that he ought to say something to keep up&#xD;
his reputation of a master-mind.&#xD;
Finnegass, the editor, emboldened by generous&#xD;
wine, ventured to remark : " In my article in last&#xD;
&#xD;
Monday's Sentinel, I alluded to this very subject,&#xD;
and put it in rather forcible terms to the-"&#xD;
But he was cut short by the Judge, who, being&#xD;
at leisure between courses, resumed his harangue:&#xD;
" The proper way to settle this trouble is very sim-&#xD;
ple. It can be arranged with very little difficulty.&#xD;
I am quite confident of that, and speak advisedly.&#xD;
All that is necessary is a conference of the patrio-&#xD;
tic intellects from all sections North and South,&#xD;
East and West, to restore harmony to the councils&#xD;
of our country. Of course, forbearance is indis-&#xD;
pensable, and a spirit of conciliation should pre-&#xD;
side over all deliberations, and-this patdehas the&#xD;
appearance of being very fine-very fine. I'll&#xD;
take some more of the truffes."&#xD;
"I wrote an article which created-" again&#xD;
attempted Finnegass.&#xD;
"Mr. Bawbee, a glass of wine with you, if you&#xD;
please," said the host, adroitly checking the edi-&#xD;
tor, and nodding gracefully to the financier.&#xD;
Mr. Bawbee was a Western banker, of Scotch&#xD;
birth, who had made no end of pelf by starting&#xD;
banks and issuing paper money. He took the&#xD;
floor, figuratively speaking, and predicted the&#xD;
dismemberment of the Union, Mr. Bawbee be-&#xD;

ing a shrewd, hard-headed Scot, had an opinion&#xD;
of his own. "It'll never do in the world, Judge.&#xD;
The matter has gone too far. lIark my words,&#xD;
gentlemen, you'll see the States divided into three&#xD;
confederacies, and that within two years. I know&#xD;
the sentiments and temper of the Western people,&#xD;
andif the South secedes, which it doubtless will,&#xD;
the West will sever their- connection with the&#xD;
East. In my section they deem their interests&#xD;
more closely identified with those of the South,&#xD;
than with the manufacturing East, and will never&#xD;
permit the mouth of 'the Mississippi, their great&#xD;
natural highway, to pass into the control of a&#xD;
foreign people, hence it is not improbable that in&#xD;
certain eventualities they would join hands with&#xD;
the South; but I .am inclined to believe, as I&#xD;
mentioned at first, that the upshot will be a di-&#xD;
vision into three confederations, and perhaps, as&#xD;
the Pacific States grow in importance, into four."&#xD;
"Tut-tut, Mr.Bawbee," interrupted Mr. Justice&#xD;
Hull, "all those minor differences and territorial&#xD;
jealousies can be reconciled. As I have before&#xD;
stated, a well-selected conference could settle the&#xD;
vexed question in a short time. Get the right men&#xD;
together, and I have no doubt as to the result."&#xD;
&#xD;
The Judge was inclined to be impatient of&#xD;
other people's opinions when they clashed with&#xD;
his own, aid was always the Sir Oracle of his&#xD;
circle.&#xD;
The Rev. Spencer Abbott, who was not greatly&#xD;
interested in the questions of state discussed by&#xD;
the other guests, diverted himself in dulcet&#xD;
small-talk with his fair neighbor, the daughter of&#xD;
the house. In spite of an evident desire to&#xD;
please, he was apparently unsuccessful, for Miss&#xD;
Edna showed signs of weariness by an occasional&#xD;
pouting" of her delicate lips,, and seemed much&#xD;
relieved when the cloth being drawn, enabled her&#xD;
and her aunt, who were the only ladies present,&#xD;
to retire to the drawing-room. Poor Abbott&#xD;
would gladly have joined them, for he was&#xD;
dreadfully bored by Finnegass, who, exalted by&#xD;
wine and in default of any other listener, at-&#xD;
tached himself to the clergyman, and treated&#xD;
him to choice extracts from stirring leaders,&#xD;
until it was only by steady sips of coffee and a&#xD;
supreme effort of will, that Abbott refrained&#xD;
from lapsing into slumber.&#xD;
At length Rangle came to the rescue, and mer-&#xD;
riment prevailed ; for that eminent senator, ignor-&#xD;

ing the weighty topics under discussion, proved&#xD;
a perfect cornucopia of jokes and funny anec-&#xD;
dotes, and actually drew a smile from the grim&#xD;
old Judge.&#xD;
By this time Mr. Mumble had recovered his&#xD;
self-possession, and grown bold and garrulous,&#xD;
He ventured to occupy a vacant chair next to the&#xD;
ex-President (that had been set apart for John&#xD;
Heath. who had not condescended to appear); and&#xD;
informed that dignitary that he (Mumbie) was a&#xD;
much older man than any one would take him&#xD;
for. As the ex-President, on being asked, failed.&#xD;
to guess Mr. Mumble's age, Mr. Mumble imparted&#xD;
the information, triumphantly adding that Mrs.&#xD;
Numbie was very much his junior, as he had&#xD;
married late in life. " Here's a knife," continued&#xD;
he, drawing forth the bone-handled jack-knife,&#xD;
" that I have carried steadily, sir, steadily for&#xD;
over fifty years. Now I don't think there are&#xD;
many such instances on record. -My local attach-&#xD;
ments are very strong. It's a peculiarity in our&#xD;
family which-&#xD;
"Between ourselves, and what is said here will&#xD;
of course go no farther," said Mr. Heath, with a&#xD;
sharp glance at Mr. Mumble,," had we not better&#xD;
&#xD;
take some preliminary steps at once, in regard to&#xD;
the matter we have been discussing? I think&#xD;
we are all of one opinion on the subject. With&#xD;
your permission, Judge, I would suggest that you&#xD;
and Senator Rangle should by all means go as.&#xD;
delegates from this State. Our friend Mr.&#xD;
ought of course to represent New York. Then I&#xD;
have thought that perhaps Crittenden would be&#xD;
of all men the most proper to lead the delegation&#xD;
from his section. In fact, I have already written&#xD;
him on the subject, and will send for a copy of&#xD;
my letter and read it to you."&#xD;
"Not now, Heath; I'll listen to it some other&#xD;
time," said Judge Hull..&#xD;
"Very well, I merely wished to show that I&#xD;
have approached him in a cautious way, and in a&#xD;
manner that I do not doubt will meet with your&#xD;
approval. Now, how does the selection of dele-&#xD;
gates strike you?. I mean, of course, as far as I&#xD;
have gone?"&#xD;
Well--well- I'll think of it--what liqueur&#xD;
is that?"&#xD;
The Judge did think of it, and the conference&#xD;
was held, as we all know. The Judge, the ex-Fed-&#xD;

eril dignitary, and Senator Rangle, were all there,&#xD;
and in company with other conservative gentle-&#xD;
men tried to stop the Niagara flood of progress&#xD;
with bulrushes. But the tide that was destined&#xD;
to sweep away the last relic of barbarism in our&#xD;
country, was rising fast, and the conservative&#xD;
brooms that were striving to stem it were flour-&#xD;
ished in vain.&#xD;
Meanwhile Judge Hull took another ehasse-&#xD;
caf' of cognac, to fortify himself against the&#xD;
night air, and looking at his watch, directed his&#xD;
carriage to be called, and rather unceremoniously&#xD;
departed. The Rev. Spencer Abbott slipped&#xD;
away to join the ladies in the drawing-room,&#xD;
while the other guests accompanied the host to&#xD;
the picture-gallery. After the ex-Federal digni-&#xD;
tary, Senator Rangle, and Mr. Bawbee had retired&#xD;
to their respective bedchambers for the night,&#xD;
Mr. Heath remained closeted with Finnegass in&#xD;
the library, while the former concocted an article&#xD;
(the editor being incapacitated by the dinner from&#xD;
any intellectual effort for the time being), to ap-&#xD;
pear in the next issue of the Belton Sentinel, and&#xD;
which he expected would create a marked sen-&#xD;
&#xD;
nation. This article, a lengthy and portentous&#xD;
leader, was prefaced by the following:&#xD;
"we are gratified to announce'that a movement of very&#xD;
great and general importance to the public, in relation to&#xD;
the present crisis of political afairs,Ais in progress; the par-&#xD;
ticulars of which having been communicated to us in con-&#xD;

curiosity and attention to a proper degree, the&#xD;
writer, after a few paragraphs, relented from&#xD;
his stoical secrecy, and with generous confidence&#xD;
divulged the fact that he had been invited to&#xD;
be present-&#xD;
"at an informal meeting of distinguished citizens, among&#xD;
whom were ex-President -, senator Rangle, Chief Jus-&#xD;
tice Hull, Andrew Bawbee, Esq., the wealthy and influen-&#xD;
tial western banker, M. Mumbie, Esq., and several other&#xD;
gentlemen scarcely less eminent, held at the residence of&#xD;
our esteemed fellow-townsman, Hon. Rufus Heath, to delib-&#xD;
erate and take into consideration the critical situation of our&#xD;
country. This assemblage, comprising, as it did, some of the&#xD;
greatest minds of the country, and men conspicuous for their&#xD;
ability in all the higher walks of life-the bench, the bar,&#xD;
the clergy, statecraft, fiance, and the manufacturing inter-&#xD;
est being all represented-were enabled to bring to the con-&#xD;
sideration of the topic before them that mature reflection,&#xD;
and careful, dispassionate deliberation, which are the fruits&#xD;
only of rare sagacity and profound wisdom. Good faith for-&#xD;
bids us to say more, and we have no desire to be premature,&#xD;

hold, at an early day, a grand National cdncil, to sit at some&#xD;
central point, and to be -composed of delegates from every&#xD;
section of the Union. We will not pursue the subject fur-&#xD;
ther at present, but we cannot refrain from observing that,&#xD;
the fact that these gentlemen, whose names are synonyms for&#xD;
all that is great, wise, and patriotic, should devote their&#xD;
energies to devise means to avert the storm that threatens&#xD;
the safety of the ship of state, is one of the most hopeful&#xD;
signs that an era of concord is at hand, when sectionalism,&#xD;
radicalism, and demagogism in every shape and form, will&#xD;
meet a merited doom, and be banished forever from the Leg-&#xD;
islative halls of a free, united, and prosperous people.&#xD;
" It is but just to state that the idea and inception of this&#xD;
proposed National conference, which will doubtless mark an&#xD;
epoch in our country's history, is due to our fellow-citizen,&#xD;
Hon. Rufus Heath, whom the spontaneous and united voice,&#xD;
of the people has designated as the next occupant of the&#xD;
gubernatorial chair of this State. When we see such evi-&#xD;
dences of enlightened patriotism, such an unselfish love of&#xD;
country on the part of a gentleman whose wealth and posi-&#xD;
tion are a sufficient guarantee that he is actuated by no&#xD;
desire for personal aggrandizement or ambitious motive, we&#xD;
do not wonder that his countrymen, without distinction of&#xD;
party, turn instinctively towards him as the proper leader&#xD;
and councillor in this hour of trial, when, if ever, sound&#xD;
statesmanship and disinterested devotion to the welfare of&#xD;
the whole country are needed. And while we know that it&#xD;
will be no easy matter to prevail upon Mr. Heath to run for&#xD;
the office, and that he would, with extreme reluctance, give&#xD;
up his retirement and important occupations, and could only&#xD;
be moved by a strong sense of duty to again enter the arena&#xD;
of public life, we feel that the people have the right to ask&#xD;
him, in this exigency, to so far sacrifice his personal interests&#xD;
and inclinations, and yield to their wishes, by accepting a&#xD;
post which he, of all others, is best fitted to fill-that of&#xD;
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF NEW J.RSEY."&#xD;

This article had the good fortune to attract&#xD;

them to the famous tailors of Toolgy Street; but&#xD;
whose faulty was it that the great Peace Congress&#xD;

VII,&#xD;
MR. HEATH was very well satisfied with the&#xD;
result of his dinner-party. It had enabled him&#xD;
to appear in the light of a leading and promi-&#xD;
nent public man. He could in the future refer to&#xD;
the views he had propounded on that occasion,&#xD;
as the origin of the memorable "Peace Con-&#xD;
gress," whereby the demon of discord was ban-&#xD;
ished forever from the councils of the nation,&#xD;
and the North and South were reconciled to&#xD;
remain perpetually locked in a fraternal em-&#xD;
brace. Then the opportune time would follow&#xD;
when his great work, the "Federal Code," would&#xD;
be accepted by an admiring people as a comple-&#xD;
ment to the Constitution, and an additional band&#xD;
to unite indissolubly tile fasces of the Union.&#xD;
The prospect was brilliant and flattering, and&#xD;
dizzy eminences of fame bewildered him. But&#xD;
there was much to be done. It was the hour for&#xD;
action, and with fervent enthusiasm he set to&#xD;
work. He opened a correspondence with every&#xD;
&#xD;
prominent public man in the country, every&#xD;
prominent conservative man of course, on the&#xD;
necessity of casting aloof from old organizations&#xD;
and framing one better adapted to meet the exi-&#xD;
gencies of the period.&#xD;
The crisis was imminent, and prompt measures&#xD;
to avert the peril were imperative. A movement&#xD;
had been inaugurated, of which ex-President&#xD;
was at the head, which required the adhesion of&#xD;
every true lover of his country, etc., etc. This&#xD;
was about the burden of every despatch, and Mr.&#xD;
Frisbee, Mr. Heath's secretary, was almost dis-&#xD;
tracted with the increased amount of writing and&#xD;
multiplicity of letters. Meanwhile Mr. Heath&#xD;
did not slacken in his efforts to obtain the candi-&#xD;
dature for Governor. He wrote numerous articles&#xD;
for the Sentinel, of like tenor to the one we&#xD;
have quoted, in advocacy of his claim to the nom-&#xD;
ination, and wherein, likewise, he showed no de-&#xD;
sire to emulate the violet. Senator Rangle, who&#xD;
had been much flattered by Mr. Heath's advances,&#xD;
was appealed to and promised his aid. John&#xD;
Peter, whose peculiar temperament was decidedly&#xD;
antipathetic to labors at the desk, was made ser-&#xD;
viceable in a different way.  He was the go-&#xD;

between at primary elections and nominating con-&#xD;
vention, to fee agents and distribute largess. His&#xD;
chief, mission, however, was to court popularity&#xD;
in Belton and the adjoining towns; for it will be&#xD;
remembered that the Hon. Rufus Heath, despite&#xD;
many munificent benefactions and public-spirited&#xD;
acts, was anything but a favorite with his neigh-&#xD;
bors. No amount of generosity on his part could&#xD;
countervail the effects of his ill-concealed airs of&#xD;
superiority, and patronizing suavity towards them,&#xD;
and wounded self-esteem never forgets nor for-&#xD;
gives. Mr. Heath was unaware of the prevalence&#xD;
of this feeling against him, and' his instructions&#xD;
to his son were intended simply to placate his&#xD;
open and avowed opponents. In particular was&#xD;
he anxious to conciliate George Gildersleeve.&#xD;
That individual, to be sure, was, as he expressed&#xD;
it, a "dyed-in-the-wool" Democrat, but Mr. Heath&#xD;
argued that at the forthcoming election old issues&#xD;
would be in a great measure abandoned, and&#xD;
he hoped, if not able to obtain Gildersleeve's sup-&#xD;
port, to at least secure his neutrality. George,&#xD;
in truth, would have been a powerful auxiliary,&#xD;
for apart from the large number of men in his&#xD;
employment, who all liked him as a fair and lib-&#xD;
&#xD;
MARK GILDERSLEEVE,         133&#xD;
oral "boss," his bluff, hail-fellow ways won the&#xD;
hearts of the hard-handed everywhere; and he&#xD;
could control more votes than any other man in&#xD;
the county. No wonder, then, that John Peter&#xD;
suddenly became very deferential to him when&#xD;
he met him at Hank Bird's livery stable; no&#xD;
wonder that he solicited George's opinion on the&#xD;
merits of a new trotter, and even came down to&#xD;
the Archimedes Works for a social chat, where,&#xD;
meeting Mark, he actually shook hands with him,&#xD;
offered a cigar, and inquired. in a pleasant way&#xD;
how he was "getting along." So astounded was&#xD;
Mark at these unexpected amenities, that h% did&#xD;
not know how to take them; but his surprise&#xD;
over, he replied with equal friendliness, not&#xD;
being one to harbor resentment when a show of&#xD;
placation was made-especially when it came&#xD;
from Edna Heath's brother. So the two young&#xD;
men had a pleasant smoke together, recalled&#xD;
reminiscences of their school days; of old Pug-&#xD;
wash, who kept the academy, and of the great&#xD;
conspiracy in which Jack was the ringleader, to&#xD;
thrash old Pugwash, when the boys signed a round-&#xD;
robin (an awful compact), with red: ink in lieu&#xD;
of blood, that fluid--although the proper one to&#xD;

have used under the circumstances-not being&#xD;
readily procurable; and how old Pugwash, getting&#xD;
hold of the round-robin, turned the tables on the&#xD;
conspirators by flogging them one and all sound-&#xD;
ly. These and many similar incidents were&#xD;
talked over until all constraint wore off, and when&#xD;
they separated, Mark felt convinced that he had,&#xD;
greatly misjudged' Jack Heath, and was much&#xD;
pleased at the reconciliation. He told his sister-&#xD;
in-law that evening, when relating the circum-&#xD;
stance of their meeting, that Jack was as good-&#xD;
hearted a fellow at bottom as ever lived, the&#xD;
only, trouble with him being his inclination to&#xD;
drink.&#xD;
"Dear, dear, what a pity!" said Mrs. Gilder-&#xD;
sleeve, whose sympathies were instantly aroused.&#xD;
"I've noticed signs of it for some time, and feel&#xD;
so sorry for him. He has grown so fleshy for a&#xD;
young man, and his face is alwa  so flaming red.&#xD;
Such a beautiful complexion as he used to have,&#xD;
too, when a boy-and to think that it is all owing&#xD;
to this dreadful, dreadful habit of drinking! If&#xD;
he would only consent to join our Band of Hope.&#xD;
Don't you think, Mark, you might persuade him&#xD;
to joinI or do you think it would- be better to&#xD;
&#xD;
MARK GILDERSLEEVE.        135&#xD;
&#xD;
have Brother Close speak to him on the subject&#xD;
first?"&#xD;
Mark shook his head dubiously at these sugges-&#xD;
tions, as if he mistrusted his ability or that of the&#xD;
entire Band of Hope, to say nothing of Brother&#xD;
Close, to induce Jack Heath to falter in his devo-&#xD;
tion to strong waters.&#xD;
"I'm afraid it's inherited, sister Margaret,"&#xD;
said he. "They say he had a grand-uncle who&#xD;
died from the effects of drink, and that his&#xD;
grandfather, old Mr. Obershaw, had a great pro-&#xD;
pensity that way, and that the only thing that&#xD;
saved him was his stinginess. Much as he loved&#xD;
liquor, he loved money more, and seldom drank&#xD;
it except at somebody else's expense."&#xD;
"Well, my child, let us not judge lest we&#xD;
be judged. Old Mr. Obershaw no .doubt did a&#xD;
great many good deeds that we know nothing&#xD;
about, and as he is now in the hands of One who&#xD;
is all-wise and merciful, it does not become us to&#xD;
pass judgment on his memory. I don't see why it&#xD;
is that people are so censorious ; I should think that&#xD;
after all the money that Mr. Obershaw spent in&#xD;
building that church and endowing it, that every&#xD;
sensible person would be convinced that he was a&#xD;

Christian, and I'm sure no one could find fault&#xD;
with the way in which the money he saved is&#xD;
being used, for there is. not an institution, or a&#xD;
society, or object of any kind, that the Heaths&#xD;
don't give to."&#xD;
"That may all be, sister Margaret, and it's&#xD;
very praiseworthy, no doubt. 'All I said, of&#xD;
meant to say, was that I didn't think Jack Heath&#xD;
was so much to blame for drinking, as he inherited&#xD;
the propensity from his grandfather, who they say&#xD;
had the reputation of being a hard drinker."&#xD;
"Well, I suppose we shall all have to answer&#xD;
for ourselves," replied Mrs. Gildersleeve, reflect-&#xD;
ively.  "And very likely it's his misfortune and&#xD;
not his fault."-&#xD;
The worthy, lady's capacity for forgiveness and&#xD;
charity was unbounded; far more ready, too, to&#xD;
defend than to censure, and she doubtless would&#xD;
have had a good word for Satan himself, had his&#xD;
sable majesty been captured and arraigned. for&#xD;
judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
VIII.&#xD;
MONTI after month passed away, and Mark had&#xD;
not dared to repeat his visit at the Cliff. Gladly'&#xD;
would he have done so, however, could he have&#xD;
found any plausible pretext. One important&#xD;
point, however, was gained. He had learned that&#xD;
Edna Heath wis not the inaccessible princess he&#xD;
had imagined; and moreover, enjoyed the ex-&#xD;
treme gratification of knowing, or rather feeling,&#xD;
that she was aware of his existence-that she act-&#xD;
ually remembered, and even noticed him, when&#xD;
he met her at the church-porch on Sundays.&#xD;
These opportunities were almost the only ones&#xD;
he had of seeing her, but the smile and bow&#xD;
with which she recognized him were enough&#xD;
to fill his heart with pleasure during the in-&#xD;
tervening week. Occasionally when at work&#xD;
he would hear the well-known din of the&#xD;
Heath equipage dashing up Main Street in all&#xD;
the pomp of its domestics in drab liveries, and&#xD;
Dalmatian dogs, and his pulse would quicken, if&#xD;

&#xD;
through his window he caught a momentary&#xD;
glimpse of Edna among the occupants of the&#xD;
vehicle. He failed not to take his evening strolls&#xD;
towards the Cliff; to pass and repass the huge&#xD;
iron gates that seemed to bar him from his dear-&#xD;
est hopes; and to linger about, indulging in all&#xD;
those absurd, preposterous fancies that addle the&#xD;
pates of all true lovers.&#xD;
Summer came, and Edna went off with the.&#xD;
Mumbies on a long tour through the White&#xD;
Mountains and Canada. During her absence,&#xD;
how desolate and dreary the world seemed to&#xD;
Mark ! Belton became unbearable, and he wan-&#xD;
dered about its streets in a frame of mindgcom-&#xD;
pared to which Marius' feelings amid 'the ruins&#xD;
of Carthage were bliss. It was in one of these&#xD;
melancholy fits that he composed his elegiac&#xD;
stanzas, entitled Love's Coronach, and commene-&#xD;
ing with these lugubrious lines:&#xD;
Shadows from the plumed pall,&#xD;
Enwrap my soul in woe,&#xD;
My life, my hope, my all&#xD;
Is gone!And every poignant throe&#xD;
etc., etc., etc.&#xD;
But when she returned, the world seemed to&#xD;
&#xD;
recover its glory, life its spice, and he was&#xD;
happy in being near her, even if he did not see&#xD;
her.. When autumn came, and the grove near&#xD;
the Falls and the maples along the river road were&#xD;
gorgeous with brilliant hues, Mark took long&#xD;
walks along the Passaic-side, chiefly to meet Miss&#xD;
Heath, who rode often on horseback, and went&#xD;
dashing along at a pace that the groom in at-&#xD;
tendance had difficulty in keeping up with.&#xD;
She always found time, however, to acknowl-&#xD;
edge Mark's salute, as he stood staring in re-&#xD;
spectful admiration at the lithe, graceful figure,&#xD;
so smart in dark riding habit, small white collar&#xD;
and blue silk cravat. He was selfish enough to&#xD;
wish at those times that her horse would bolt&#xD;
over the bank into the river, or do something.&#xD;
that would give him a chance to rescue her life&#xD;
at the peril of his own, and so prove his devotion.&#xD;
Fortunately, perhaps, for the young lady, no such&#xD;
opportunity occurred, and our hero was obliged&#xD;
to content himself with less demonstrative wor-&#xD;
ship and vent his passion in scribbling poetic&#xD;
numbers.&#xD;
The shortened days and inclement weather of&#xD;
winter curtailed Mark's rambles, and his evenings&#xD;

were spent with his piano and books at home, or&#xD;
with his briar-wood pipe and chess at Dr. Wattle-&#xD;
top's.&#xD;
One evening as he sat down to tea in the little&#xD;
basement dining-room, his sister-in-law, with a&#xD;
significant smile, laid an elegant envelope by&#xD;
the side of his plate. "There, Mark," said she,&#xD;
"there is something that will please you, I've no&#xD;
doubt."&#xD;
He opened the envelope with a little trepida-.&#xD;
tion, and found it to contain, as he had half-sus-&#xD;
pected, an engraved request from Miss Heath,&#xD;
for the pleasure of his company at "The Cliff,"&#xD;
on a certain evening.&#xD;
" When it came this afternoon," said Mrs.&#xD;
Gildersleeve, "I was in such a flutter. Bridget&#xD;
was-out to see her sick sister, and I was washing&#xD;
the dinner things when the bell rang. I just&#xD;
took time to dry my hands and ran to the door,&#xD;
for I expected as much as could be that it was&#xD;
one of the men from the Works that your brother&#xD;
said he would send to fix the grate, and I was so&#xD;
confused when I saw it was a stranger-the young&#xD;
man with a cockade on his hat that follows Miss&#xD;
Heath when she goes out horseback riding--I&#xD;
&#xD;
don't, know whether you have ever noticed him&#xD;
or not?"&#xD;
Mark said he thought he had; and his brother&#xD;
remarked that it was another of those English&#xD;
liveried flankeys that that old aristocrat, Rufe&#xD;
Heath, had imported to demoralize our democratic&#xD;
institutions.&#xD;
"George," said Mrs. Gildersleeve, reproach-&#xD;
fully, "you shouldn't talk in that way, my dear.&#xD;
Mr. Heath does a great deal of good-a great&#xD;
deal; and as for, the young man, I'm sure he was&#xD;
very respectful and well-behaved, indeed. I&#xD;
don't know, though, what he must have thought,&#xD;
for I must have looked very untidy, and I was so&#xD;
confused and flushed that I never once thought&#xD;
of asking him whether he would walk in and sit&#xD;
down, which wasn't a bit polite or hospitable on&#xD;
my part. I hope, Mark, you will accept this&#xD;
invitation, for you should certainly go out in&#xD;
society more than you do. I do wish you had&#xD;
been with us the other evening at Mrs. Sniffen's&#xD;
tea-party. I don't know when I have had such a&#xD;

wife has a beautiful voice, and she sang 'Plunged&#xD;

sure there couldn't have been a dry eye present.&#xD;
I know you would have enjoyed it. But lately&#xD;
you have taken to staying in your room too much;&#xD;
you seem to have given up the Debating Society&#xD;
altogether and never go anywhere, except it is to&#xD;
Dr. Wattletop's, and I must confess that I don't&#xD;
half like it. The doctor, to be sure, is one of&#xD;
the kindest and best souls in the world, but he&#xD;
has such very queer notions. They;even go so&#xD;
far as to say that he is a freethinker. Now I&#xD;
would be very sorry to believe that of any one ; but&#xD;
he says such very strange things, if the reports are&#xD;
true, and Brother Close told me that Mrs. Slocum&#xD;
told him, that her nephew, James Cudlipp, said&#xD;
that when he lived at old Mrs. Bradbury's, and&#xD;
her brother died, he heard the doctor with his&#xD;
own ears say at the funeral, that when people&#xD;
became more civilized, they would burn the re-&#xD;
mains of the dead and preserve their ashes. in&#xD;
marble urns, instead of burying them in the earth.&#xD;
Now, I do think such an idea as that is shocking'&#xD;
and perfectly dreadful."&#xD;
" Well, Maggie," put in her husband; as he&#xD;
&#xD;
buttered a fresh biscuit, "every man to his trade.&#xD;
Dr. Wattletop ain't no dominie, and don't pretend&#xD;
to be, but his head's level on physic, and he's no&#xD;
slouch of a sawbones, either. When he cut off&#xD;
Sammy Tooker's leg I timed him, and he had it&#xD;
all done clean in ten minutes and fourteen sec-&#xD;
onds by my stop-watch, and Sammy's brother said&#xD;
it was the best job of the kind he ever saw&#xD;
done; and he ought to know, being a butcher&#xD;
himself. Why, Pokemore, that you think is the&#xD;
greatest doctor in The world, I'll bet would have&#xD;
taken hours to do it, and made a botch of it after&#xD;
all. The only fault I have to find with Wattle-&#xD;
top is, that he's such a pig-headed John Bull."&#xD;
Mark ventured a few words in defence of his&#xD;
friend the doctor, and endeavored to allay the&#xD;
rising apprehensions of Mrs. Gildersleeve in re-&#xD;
gard to his imbibing any unwholesome opinions&#xD;
from the eccentric physician.&#xD;
"Now, Mark," continued Mrs. Gildersleeve, "I&#xD;
do hope you will spruce up, and make yourself as&#xD;
agreeable as possible at Miss Heath's party. I'll&#xD;
say this for her, that there isn't a nicer, sweeter,&#xD;
or more charitable girl in all Belton than she is.&#xD;
Mrs. Sniffen says that she never calls upon her&#xD;

for any contribution for any object whatever, but&#xD;
what she gets all and more than she asks for; and&#xD;
I do believe she supplies every sick person and.&#xD;
funeral in the town with hot-house grapes and&#xD;
flowers. Then she's-so very lady-like too. Dear&#xD;
me, if I were a young man-well, I should think&#xD;
you'd feel very much pleased at this invitation,&#xD;
especially as you never took any pains to make&#xD;
yourself agreeable to the family. But then, to&#xD;
be sure, Edna Heath is kind to every one, and I&#xD;
do believe that every man, woman, and child in&#xD;
Belton loves her."&#xD;
Mark felt as if he could not see the necessity&#xD;
for that, and, if it were so, as if the population of&#xD;
the town had audaciously conspired to infringe&#xD;
on his province.&#xD;
His brother, as he rose from table, also prof-&#xD;
fered advice on the subject, "If you can hang up&#xD;
your hat in that house, Mark, you're made for&#xD;
life. She'll have more dollars than you can&#xD;
shake a stick at, or know what to do with.&#xD;
Never mind the old man; there's a good deal of&#xD;
nonsense in. Rufe Heath's airs, and he's mild as&#xD;
milk if he finds you aint anyway awed. Keep a&#xD;
stiff upper lip-don't be cowed, and you're bound&#xD;
&#xD;
to win. Whatever you do, though, be independent&#xD;
-independent as a hog on ice, and they'll like&#xD;
you all the better for it. That's my advice,&#xD;
Time I was off to the Lodge."&#xD;
Mrs. Gildersleeve did not entirely approve of&#xD;
her husband's way of putting it, and observed,&#xD;
"As to what your brother says, Mark, about Miss&#xD;
Heath's fortune, or her father's fortune, I know&#xD;
you never would be actuated by any motives in&#xD;
regard to that. Miss Heath, I'm sure, will be a&#xD;
treasure and prize to any man even if she never&#xD;
has a penny in the world,"&#xD;
"Very likely," said Mark, affecting indifference,&#xD;
"Miss Heath is certainly a very pleasant and re-&#xD;
fined young lady."&#xD;
"Indeed, she is," said Mrs. Gildersleeve, em=&#xD;
phatically, "and more than that, a very good&#xD;
young lady."&#xD;
Mark's gratification at receiving the invitation&#xD;
was instantly dampened, when he reflected that he&#xD;
could not avail of it without exposing himself to&#xD;

regard to his lameness, revived ; and he dreaded&#xD;
to challenge criticism in an assemblage where he&#xD;
longed to shine.. Hence it was with a sharp pang&#xD;
of mortified vanity and disappointment that he&#xD;
set about writing a "regret," alleging as an ex-.&#xD;
cuse for not being able to accept Miss Heath's in-.&#xD;
vitation, the conventional fib, a prior engagement.&#xD;
Twice he wrote such a missive, and each time&#xD;
tore it up when in. the struggle between sense and&#xD;
self-love the former gained the ascendancy; but&#xD;
in the end that exaggerated self-importance which&#xD;
leads us to believe the rest of the world vastly in-&#xD;
terested in our haps and mishaps, our appearance&#xD;
and position-this infatuation triumphed, and the&#xD;
"regret " was despatched.&#xD;
" Well, Mark," said Mrs. Gildersleeve on the&#xD;
appointed evening, "Miss hIeath's party comes&#xD;
off to-night, don't it ? From all I hear it's going&#xD;
to be a grand affair. They say there have been II&#xD;
don't know how many hundred invitations sent&#xD;
out, and some are coming even from New York."&#xD;
" So much the better, then, for I don't think I&#xD;
shall be -missed," said Mark with a forced smile.&#xD;
Mrs. Gildersleeve dropped her work and looked&#xD;
&#xD;
MARK GILDERstEy,&#xD;
&#xD;
at him in surprise. "Missed!1 You don't mean&#xD;
to say that you are not going?"&#xD;
Mark looked rather confused, "I do mean to&#xD;
say so. I-.-.I don't feel like it."&#xD;
"Dear me, you're not, sick, I hope?" inquired&#xD;
Mrs. Gildersleeve with a look of concern.&#xD;
"No, sister, no--but I'm not in the humor to&#xD;
go.&#xD;
"Why, really, I'm so surprised and sorry. I&#xD;
thought you would certainly take advantage of&#xD;
such an invitation, for I know you would enjoy&#xD;
it very much if you went. There is nothing ails:&#xD;
you, is there, Mark?" said Mrs. Gildersleeve, re-&#xD;
peating her inquiry,&#xD;
"No, sister Margaret, no," replied Mark with a&#xD;
little impatience, and to escape his sister-in-law's&#xD;
inquisitive solicitude, he withdrew to his room.&#xD;
He took up his guitar and tried to thrum the&#xD;
Jota Aragonesa, but there was no melody there&#xD;
to soothe his troubled breast. IH skimmed over&#xD;
a page or two of Burton's "Anatomy of Melan..&#xD;
choly," that Dr. Wattletop had recommended him&#xD;
to read, but his feelings were too much in conso&#xD;
nancewith the subject treated of to be diverted by&#xD;
it, and he threw the book aside, filled his briar-&#xD;

wood pipe, and sought consolation in Killikin.&#xD;
nick. Even that resource failed him, and the&#xD;
fire in the bowl died away unheeded. Then to&#xD;
shake off the tristful thoughts he paced his room,&#xD;
but the old wound inflicted by Edna's cruel com-&#xD;
miseration seemed to bleed afresh, and the re-&#xD;
membrance of that bitter pity unceasingly re-&#xD;
turned, until chagrin gave place to anger vented&#xD;
in fierce execrations on his halting foot, alterna-&#xD;
ted with lamentations on his unfortunate condi-&#xD;
tion. He believed he could have borne almost any&#xD;
other bodily infirmity better, and would gladly&#xD;
have given his right arm to walk as other men.&#xD;
What an effort it had cost him to deny himself&#xD;
the inestimable pleasure of beholding the object&#xD;
of his adoration in all the pride of her beauty!&#xD;
And yet, why had he done so ? Although imper-&#xD;
fect in a trivial degree, would he, after all, suffer&#xD;
much in comparison with others? Byron, the&#xD;
splendid Byron, was lame, and so was Walter&#xD;
Scott, and were they not the fdols of society'?&#xD;
Would her glance fall that evening on a hand-&#xD;
somer face? He stopped before a mirror, that&#xD;
reflected eyes full of superb fire, and a brow as&#xD;
fine as any that ever adorned child of Hellas, and&#xD;
&#xD;
he smiled with gratified vanity, like a brainless&#xD;
coquette. But instantly ashamed of his weakness,&#xD;
he turned away, drew on his overcoat, and sought&#xD;
the struts -to distract him from unwholesome&#xD;
reveries. Unwittingly his feet followed the ac-&#xD;
customed path, and he was half way to the Cliff&#xD;
before he discovered his absence of mind. He&#xD;
would have retraced his steps and gone in an-&#xD;
other direction, but an irresistible impulse urged&#xD;
him on.&#xD;
It was a fine frosty night in February. There&#xD;
was no moon, but the myriad of stars that stud-&#xD;
ded the dark sky glinted like gems, and the at-&#xD;
mosphere was bracing and exhilarating.   Mr.&#xD;
Heath's residence presented a brilliant scene.&#xD;
The lamps on the gate-posts, those hanging in the&#xD;
porch, and the many illuminated windows shed&#xD;
rays that tinted to brilliance the snow covering&#xD;
the lawn and flecking the dark evergreens; while&#xD;
here and thee a pendant icicle or the rime-cov-&#xD;
ered bough of a tree coruscated like a crystal&#xD;
prism. Mark stood for some time in contempla-&#xD;
tion. He heard the sound of rippling music, the&#xD;
muffled patter of hoofs and creaking of wheels&#xD;
over the crisp snow as carriage after carriage de-&#xD;

posited its burden at the porch. At length, as if&#xD;
drawn by some invisible magnet, he went stealthi-&#xD;
ly up the avenue, slinking behind the evergreens,&#xD;
and endeavored to gain a position whence to Ibok&#xD;
unobserved through the drawing-room windows.&#xD;
He felt like a spy, and started at every sound with&#xD;
fear of being discovered, but the temptation to&#xD;
see Edna was too powerful, and curiosity over.&#xD;
came his scruples. Climbing on the ledge of a&#xD;
conservatory, he could, by placing his feet on the&#xD;
chamfered stone-work of the building, reach the&#xD;
level of a large bay-window at one end of the&#xD;
drawing-room. An inside sash was partly open, so&#xD;
that he could both see and hear through the&#xD;
blinds and remain unperceived. He now wit-&#xD;
nessed a sight that soon banished his melancholy,&#xD;
for joy in its fellows has a contagious influence&#xD;
over youth difficult to resist, and he regretted the&#xD;
foolish resolve he had made to abstain from&#xD;
joining the party. They were nearly, all young&#xD;
people; among -them, however, many strangers&#xD;
to Belton. Mrs. Applegate, who matronized&#xD;
them, rustled about in a voluminous dress of&#xD;
moire-antique, and young Mrs. Ieath sat in an&#xD;
easy-chair in one corner, resplendent with dia.&#xD;
&#xD;
monds and languidly rattling a Spanish fan,&#xD;
while her lord stood leaning in a door-way look-&#xD;
ing sulky, bored, and uncomfortable as he fum-&#xD;
bled away at a pair of tight gloves. The Rev.&#xD;
Spencer Abbott, in the neatest of clerical attire,&#xD;
was sauntering leisurely from group to group,&#xD;
with his hands behind his back and an air of mild&#xD;
benignity on his pallid countenance. Present,&#xD;
too, were Will Hull and his sister Constance, the&#xD;
Judge's grandchildren, and the Mumbies; Ada,&#xD;
Bob, and the younger brother, Decatur, a sprig&#xD;
from the Naval Academy, evidently under the&#xD;
effects of his gilt buttons and embroidered foul-&#xD;
anchors. Mark was not .long in discovering&#xD;
Edna. Her fair face was heightened in color,&#xD;
and beaming with joy. His eyes followed her&#xD;
eagerly amid the couples that whirled swiftly by,&#xD;
and he caught glimpses of her satin-shod feet,&#xD;
arched like an Arab maid's. The music ceased,&#xD;
and the confused chatter of many voices arose.&#xD;
Close by him came a group of girls prattling to-&#xD;
gether, and discussing their partners with the&#xD;
frankness of guileless maidenhood.  Scraps of&#xD;
their conversation reached him. One of the girls&#xD;
was Constance Hull. Said she, "I do so like&#xD;

to dance with Alfred, he keeps such excellent&#xD;
time."&#xD;
"But then he parts his hair in the middle,&#xD;
Constance, and I think that is so horrid. Did&#xD;
you notice his malachite sleeve-buttons and topaz&#xD;
studs ? Wretched taste, isn't it? They say he is&#xD;
engaged too-dear me! I don't see how any one&#xD;
could marry a person with so little idea of what&#xD;
is becoming. Do tell me who that gentleman is&#xD;
that was dancing with Edna? I do think he is&#xD;
too handsome for anything."&#xD;
"Why, don't you know? Why, it's Sarah Car-&#xD;
ver's cousin, Fred Spooner-isn't he splendid?&#xD;
He came all the way from Boston. He's quite&#xD;
smitten with Edna, and I know she admires him."&#xD;
Mark's eavesdropping was sufficiently punished&#xD;
by this intelligence, but he was destined to suffer&#xD;
still further when. he saw Edna dancing again&#xD;
with this admirer, who was a tall blooming&#xD;
fellow, all ease and grace. He felt a pang of&#xD;
jealousy when he saw them after the dance&#xD;
promenading together; 1Spooner chatting with&#xD;
animation and proud of his partner, while she&#xD;
looked at him evidently pleased and amused at&#xD;
Lis remarks. They came directly towards the&#xD;
&#xD;
window and took seats in the recess. Miss Hull&#xD;
and her companions had left the spot, and the&#xD;
young fellow probably desired to enjoy a tate-d-&#xD;
tate. He was pleading for a flower from Edna's&#xD;
nosegay. "I beg and beseech you to bestow&#xD;
upon me a bud from your beautiful bouquet."&#xD;
"Dear me," said Edna, "what a quantity of&#xD;
B's!"&#xD;
"Yes, quite a swarm, attracted by your exces-&#xD;
sive sweetness, of course," smirked Spooner,&#xD;
pleased at his effort at wit; while Mark, who had&#xD;
caught every word, thought it very silly, not to&#xD;
say impertinent.&#xD;
Edna selected a rosebud, which she gave to&#xD;
her companion, who placed it in his button-hole.&#xD;
"I shall keep it forever, Miss Heath."&#xD;
" Indeed, how long is your forever ? "&#xD;
"As long as memory holds a seat in this dis-&#xD;
tracted brain, and longer. I'll take it home, and&#xD;
when it wilts I'll press it in my prayer-book."&#xD;
"Where you are sure never to see it again,"&#xD;
remarked Edna.&#xD;
"Merciless Miss Heath !.-Excessively warm,&#xD;
though, here, isn't. it ? Hadn't I better throw&#xD;
open the top blind?" and with that he pushed it&#xD;

of dogs, are you fond of 'em, Miss Heath? I've&#xD;
got just the smallest black-and-tan-well, he&#xD;
don't weigh over twenty-three ounces, and if you&#xD;
would only accept him, I'd be so delighted. I&#xD;
think the world of him, and to know that he was&#xD;
constantly near you, would make me the happiest&#xD;
feller in existence. To be sure his ears aren't&#xD;
cropped yet. Do you like cropped black-and-&#xD;
tans? Or if you'd prefer a Spitz? I've got a&#xD;
real nice Spitz, but he's snappish. Spitzes are&#xD;
apt to be snappish, haven't you noticed? But then&#xD;
he's just as good a ratter as any black-and-tan&#xD;
you ever saw. When you come to Boston, if you&#xD;
and Sarah Carver will only come to Roxbury-"&#xD;
By this time, the .Rev. Spencer Abbott, who&#xD;
was on his third round of inspection, came up&#xD;
with a graceful droop to the couple: "Reposing&#xD;
after the fatigue of the dance, I presume, Miss&#xD;
Edna?   What a beautiful bouquet! Really,&#xD;
Miss Edna, I think you have the most beautiful&#xD;
bouquet of any young lady present. Miss Mum-&#xD;
bie has an elegant one, but the blending of hues&#xD;
is hardly so artistic in hers. Yours, ah-presents&#xD;

to the eye of the observer such a-such an ex-&#xD;
quisite juxtaposition of colors. How fragrant,&#xD;
too! Roses-heliotrope-..Dame Nature's jewels.&#xD;
What a singularly beautiful conceit and myth&#xD;
that was of the ancients, that roses sprang from&#xD;
the blood of Venus. Dear me, therds quite a&#xD;
draught here. Ah! I see-a window down-&#xD;
aren't you afraid of catching cold? Lovely as A&#xD;

Fortunately for Miss Heath, who feared the&#xD;
parson was about to favor her with a book or two&#xD;
of "Paradise Lost," Bob Mumbie came up to claim&#xD;
her for a redowa, and the Rev. Spencer Abbott&#xD;
sauntered off and betook himself to-a critical ex-&#xD;
amination, accompanied with poetical comments,&#xD;
of Mercedita Heath's fan. Mark noticed that&#xD;
Edna had left her handkerchief on the tripod&#xD;
near the window, and as Fred Spooner had&#xD;
darted away with Miss Mumbie and the coast&#xD;
was clear, a sudden and uncontrollable desire&#xD;
seized him to possess this handkerchief. Yield-&#xD;

ing to the impulse, and without further reflection,&#xD;
he raised the lower sash of the window, crouched&#xD;
under the tripod, snatched the coveted article,&#xD;
and frightened at his temerity, instantly with-&#xD;
drew. He hastened homeward, pressing the bit&#xD;
of cambric to his lips, and rhapsodizing as he&#xD;
went along like a demented Strephon. When he&#xD;
arrived home, he found his sister-in-law sitting&#xD;
up for him. She noticed that he looked somewhat&#xD;
flushed and disturbed, but as he seemed to avoid&#xD;
her scrutinizing eyes, she did not question him.&#xD;
What a night of fever and torment he passed!&#xD;
The conflicting emotions that agitated him ban-&#xD;
ished sleep. The delicate web he had filched&#xD;
lay under his burning cheek and throbbing tem-&#xD;
pies ; its subtle perfume intoxicated him, evoking&#xD;
ecstatic glamour and vivid visions of Edna's face&#xD;
radiant with joy and beauty. Then jealousy&#xD;
swept the chords of his sensitive nature, as he&#xD;
recalled the smiles bestowed on his presumed&#xD;
rival, and bitter curses on his defective foot fol-&#xD;
lowed, until, in the struggle between tumultuous&#xD;
passion and reason, his better sense triumphed,&#xD;
and tears bedewed his eyes-tears of vexation&#xD;
that he should be so childish, so vain, and envious.&#xD;

As he lay thus, his door was softly opened, and&#xD;
he heard the voice of his sister-in-law inquiring&#xD;
if he were indisposed?&#xD;
"No, no, Sister Margaret, thank you. Please&#xD;
don't disturb yourself."&#xD;
"I heard a noise, and feared you might be&#xD;
taken ill."&#xD;
"No, thank you.    Please leave me."   His&#xD;
heart was stilled at this fresh evidence of tender&#xD;
solicitude on the part of one, who had been to&#xD;
him all that a mother could be. He contrasted&#xD;
her calm, cheerful ways and unselfishness with&#xD;
his egotism and discontent. Repentant, he&#xD;
prayed to be forgiven, and soon after fell asleep.&#xD;

THE next morning his jaded face told plainly of&#xD;
the mental struggle he had undergone. He took&#xD;
up Edna's handkerchief, pressed it to his lips rever-&#xD;
entially, as if it had been a shred from the robe of&#xD;
a saint, and then reflected how he should return it,&#xD;
to its owner without exciting suspicion or betray-&#xD;
ing his impertinent freak. " She's a seraph and'&#xD;
I'm an idiot! "was his pithy conclusion, "An egre-&#xD;
gious and presumptuous idiot ! If she knew all,&#xD;
what a laughing-stock Ishould be.to her! I will&#xD;
not think of her again, but as one to worship.&#xD;
What am I, or what have I done to merit any&#xD;
favor from her? What could she ever possibly&#xD;
see in meT I must and shall try to forget her.&#xD;
No-I would be very ungrateful to do that. But&#xD;
I must only esteem, respect, and worship her at a&#xD;
distance; and if she prefers that tall, girlish,&#xD;
dancing-Jack, why-no, I have no right to think&#xD;
that. Well, I must return the handkerchief in&#xD;
some way, and then we shall be henceforth as&#xD;

strangers-not exactly strangers-but I will only&#xD;
think of her as an acquaintance."&#xD;
He held to this resolution for at least a week,&#xD;
rigidly schooling his -heart to submission; but&#xD;
alas, this resolve met the fate of its kind, for on&#xD;
the eighth day he accidentally saw the disturber&#xD;
of his peace, and away to the four winds of&#xD;
heaven went all humility and self-abnegation.&#xD;
And he met her of all places-in a workshop.&#xD;
Edna happened to be passing the Archimedes&#xD;
Works on her return from the stationer's, when&#xD;
the proprietor, who was looking out of the win-&#xD;
dow of his counting-room, caught a glimpse of&#xD;
her, and going out accosted the young lady, much&#xD;
to her surprise, with a request (to walk into his&#xD;
office a moment as he wanted to consult her.&#xD;
She good-naturedly complied, and went into the&#xD;
room, where the old book-keeper bustled about&#xD;
to dust a chair for her, and the junior clerks&#xD;
were rather distracted from their labors by the&#xD;
apparition of such a visitor.&#xD;
" What I wanted was to ask your opinion of a&#xD;
new cart I've been getting, Miss Heath," said&#xD;
George Gildersleeve.&#xD;

Yes, a cart de visit."&#xD;
" Oh, a photograph," said Edna.&#xD;
"Yes. Mrs. Gildersleeve's sister, Mrs. Rob.&#xD;
erts, who lives in Trenton, hasn't got one of mine,&#xD;
and I promised to send her one; so I've been'&#xD;
getting some struck off. Now here are the&#xD;
proofs of three different kinds. Snopple got 'em&#xD;
up; and as you're a young lady of taste, the&#xD;
thought struck me, as I saw you go by, that you'd&#xD;
be a capital judge and I want your opinion as&#xD;
to which is the best."&#xD;
Edna, rather amused, scrutinized the pictures&#xD;
that represented George looking like a comely&#xD;
bulldog, and said that she thought they were all&#xD;
fair likenesses.&#xD;
"But which is the best? This one's a new&#xD;
attitood for me. I never had one taken in that&#xD;
way before. Suppose you were picking one out&#xD;
for yourself, which would you choose?"&#xD;
To please him, Edna gave the preference to one&#xD;
over the others.&#xD;
"Well-I don't know but you're right," said&#xD;
George reflectively, as he admired the one se-&#xD;
lected. "I'll have a lot of these struck off,&#xD;
and when they're finished, I won't forget to&#xD;

Edna said no-that the first one mentioned&#xD;
would do, and thanked him. Noticing the horse-&#xD;
shoe over the fire-place, she inquired whether it&#xD;
were hung there to keep off witches, or for good-&#xD;
luck.&#xD;
"Good-luck ?-no, not exactly, although I&#xD;
shouldn't wonder if it had brought us good-luck.&#xD;
As for the witches, you see yourself it don't keep&#xD;
off the most dangerous kind-the young and&#xD;
beautiful ones," replied George, with an attempt&#xD;
to be gallant.&#xD;
"Oh thank you, Mr. Gildersleeve; you're very&#xD;
flattering indeed," replied Edna with a smile.&#xD;
"I wouldn't take five hundred -dollars for that&#xD;
horse-shoe, Miss Heath," resumed George proudly.&#xD;
"Indeed," said Edna.&#xD;
"No, nor a thousand. That there shoe that&#xD;
you see there, came off Gineral George Washing-&#xD;
ton's horse just afore he fought the great battle&#xD;
of Trenton. My grandfather shod him anew&#xD;
himself, and kept this old shoe. The forge was&#xD;
right here, and that chimney-stack was part of it.&#xD;
That's the story, Miss Heath; and at that time&#xD;

your great-grandfather, old Whitman Obershaw,&#xD;
ran a saw-mill just along by the head of the&#xD;
rapids, ten rods beyond the foot-bridge, and I've&#xD;
heard my father say often enough that the old&#xD;
man was a pretty hard case, and tight about half&#xD;
the time."&#xD;
Edna, though nettled and confused for a mo-&#xD;
ment at these free reflections on her maternal&#xD;
ancestor, could not refrain from smiling at&#xD;
the unconcerned way in which they were im-i&#xD;
pai-ted. -&#xD;
'" To think how you've grown lately, Miss&#xD;
Heath," continued the blunt iron-master; "why,&#xD;
it seems to me but last week that you and Ada&#xD;
Mumbie and Judge Hull's granddaughter, were&#xD;
little bits of things, stopping, as you came from&#xD;
school with your arms full of books, to peep in&#xD;
at the foundry, half-scared, with youreyes as big&#xD;
as saucers. Well, time passes, and things change,&#xD;
and the Works are different now from what they&#xD;
was then. We've enlarged them considerable.&#xD;
Have you been through them lately? No-well,&#xD;
would you like to go ? Without bragging a great&#xD;
deal, I don't think we can be beat much in our,&#xD;
line in the world." George's world, by the bye,&#xD;
&#xD;
was bounded by New York and Trenton, and&#xD;
consisted chiefly of Belton.&#xD;
Edna said she had been in Mr. Mumbie's paper-&#xD;
mill, and had been much interested, and thought&#xD;
she would like to see the Works, if convenient.&#xD;
The establishment was a model one of its kind.&#xD;
In extent and completeness it had no superior,if&#xD;
a rival, in the country, and the owner took a jus-&#xD;
tifible pride in showing it. It covered several&#xD;
acres, and the buildings were fine ones of brick,&#xD;
with slate roofs, and some pretensions to architect-&#xD;
ural beauty. Gildersleeve led Edna first to a&#xD;
detached room well lighted, neat, and quiet as a&#xD;
boudoir, with a vine trailing over the glass roof.&#xD;
This was the engine-room, where tireless monsters&#xD;
of polished steel and brass, with gigantic fly-&#xD;
wheels and darting pistons, worked noiselessly&#xD;
and exactly as a chronometer, and enabled the&#xD;
proprietor to be consistently independent of the&#xD;
water-power if he chose.&#xD;
Then they went to the foundry-a fearful&#xD;
place, where begrimed men, hideous in the glare&#xD;
of furnace flames, ran dragging pots of molten&#xD;
iron like Cyclops, while the ground trembled&#xD;
beneath the titanic blows of trip-hammers; next&#xD;

to the boiler-shop, where Edna was almost deaf-&#xD;
ened; and to the machine-shop, a long room&#xD;
filled with whirling shafts, gearing, and lathes in-&#xD;
numerable, where she was greatly amazed at the&#xD;
wonderful planes that sliced off glossy ribbons of&#xD;
steel, and the powerful shears and punches that&#xD;
cut the tough metal like pasteboard. Edna was&#xD;
much impressed by what she saw. She was&#xD;
struck with the many evidences around her of&#xD;
human skill and power. The admirable adapta-&#xD;
tion and complete control of superhuman forces&#xD;
seemed to" her sublime, and she wondered that&#xD;
the presiding genius of such a marvellous palace&#xD;
of artcould be the ordinary mortal beside her.&#xD;
Had Edna been an older judge of human nature,&#xD;
she would have discovered that George Gilder-&#xD;
sleeve was anything but an ordinary man. True,&#xD;
he was uneducated, rough, overweeningly vain, '&#xD;
without tact; his fibre coarse and vigorous as a&#xD;
buffalo's, but his tenacity of will, love of order,&#xD;
vigilance, and business shrewdness were remark-&#xD;
able, and capable of conquering success in almost&#xD;
any department of life. His vigilance and love&#xD;
of order had not escaped Edna's notice, for as&#xD;
they went along, she remarked that his searching&#xD;
&#xD;
glances were directed everywhere, and she was&#xD;
amused to see him pick up a nail from the floor,&#xD;
and at another time reprimand an apprentice se-&#xD;
verely because a small bit of cotton waste had&#xD;
been left on the bright oil-cloth of the engine-&#xD;
room.&#xD;
"Who suggested the name of your Works,&#xD;
Mr. Gildersleeve?" said Edna.&#xD;
"Oh! that was Mark's notion. When we rebuilt&#xD;
them, I wanted to name them the George Wash-&#xD;
ington Works, but I concluded that that would&#xD;
be too personal, so I let Mark have his own way,&#xD;
and he named them after Archy Medes. This&#xD;
Archy Medes was an engineer of ancient times,&#xD;
who discovered something in a bath-tub, I don't&#xD;
exactly remember what, but Mark can tell you if&#xD;
you want to know. There he is over there. See&#xD;
him, Miss Heath?"&#xD;
They were in the finishing-shop at the time,&#xD;
and George pointed to the farther end, where&#xD;
Mark was, but with his back towards them so&#xD;
that Edna had not recognized the young man.&#xD;
He was standing with his coat off and a plan in&#xD;
his hand, giving directions to a group of work-&#xD;
men.&#xD;

"He's setting up an improved lathe for driv-&#xD;
ing wheels-a new idea of his own," explained&#xD;
George.&#xD;
Edna stood watching Mark. He was very&#xD;
intently occupied moving hither and thither,&#xD;
now stooping and scrutinizing, then, with rolled-&#xD;
up sleeves, dexterously wielding hammer and&#xD;
chisel. His dark, delicate features reflected the&#xD;
keen concentrated play of the faculties, and re-&#xD;
vealed an expression of intellectual beauty that&#xD;
Edna had not before noticed. She thought she,&#xD;
had never seen so handsome a young man.&#xD;
Mark unconsciously had made a more favorable&#xD;
impression in his homely guise than he ever&#xD;
could have. done in a ball-room. At length he&#xD;
perceived her, and could not repress a look of&#xD;
confusion. Giving a few orders to theworkmen,&#xD;
he drew on his coat and came forward to meet&#xD;
Edna with an embarrassed air.&#xD;
"An unexpected pleasure, Miss. Heath," he.&#xD;
said, with a feeble attempt to be distant in ac-&#xD;
cordance with the noble resolves he had recorded.&#xD;
"The pleasure is with me, nI'n certain, for I've&#xD;
been very much delighted and instructed. I&#xD;

ers, and I am indebted for it all to your brother,&#xD;
who was kind enough to invite me to see the&#xD;
Works, and explain everything. But I am very&#xD;
much afraid that I have interrupted you."&#xD;
"A very pleasant interruption; for it's so sel-&#xD;
dom we are favored with the presence of ladies&#xD;
here, that we appreciate their visits correspond-&#xD;
ingly," replied Mark gallantly. Her pleasant,&#xD;
winning way had disarmed him completely, and&#xD;
he was at her mercy at once. Edna then bid the&#xD;
brothers good-by, remarking that she had tarried&#xD;
too long and must return home.&#xD;
Of course Mark begged to be permitted to es-&#xD;
cort her, as evening was approaching, to which re-&#xD;
quest she graciously assented. The most attrac-&#xD;
tive trait, perhaps, in our heroine's character was&#xD;
her frankness of speech and manner proceeding&#xD;
from a nature singularly free from affectation.&#xD;
We say singularly, as it is well known that the&#xD;
best of our young ladies are not entirely exempt&#xD;
from little artificial airs and graces especially, if&#xD;
like the subject of these remarks, they occupy a&#xD;
position in society somewhat analogous to that of&#xD;
a duke's daughter among gentry. This artless-&#xD;
ness was the more remarkable in the child of a&#xD;

MARK GILDERSL E19&#xD;
&#xD;
family noted for its intense pride and pretensions.&#xD;
Edna was the exception; simple in her tastes,&#xD;
and ignoring the deference conceded to wealth to&#xD;
an extent that would have amazed her father,&#xD;
could he have spared enough attention from state&#xD;
affairs to study his daughter's character. Natu-&#xD;
rally, when a young lady of position remains un-&#xD;
impressed by people's purses, and is as courteous&#xD;
to the poor as to the rich, she cannot fail to be-&#xD;
come a favorite with all; and it is no wonder that&#xD;
the master of the Archimedes Works remarked to&#xD;
Gregg, the old book-keeper, after she was gone,&#xD;
that if he were a young man seeking a wife, she'd&#xD;
be just the girl he'd pick out, and that Gregg said&#xD;
she would be his choice too ; nor that Knatch-&#xD;
bull, the foreman, concurred, and added, that she&#xD;
was a "natty lass," to which George said, " That's&#xD;
so, and thorough-bred," and told Gregg to make a&#xD;
minute to remind him to send one of his "carts,"&#xD;
a three-quarter face, to the young lady, as he had&#xD;
promised, and wouldn't disappoint her for the&#xD;
world.&#xD;
Meanwhile Mark and Edna were walking on&#xD;
in silence towards the street that led to the latter's&#xD;
home; Mark, in his elation, scarcely knowing&#xD;

how to broach the conversation. Finally he&#xD;
recollected that it would be in order to thank&#xD;
Edna for the invitation she had sent him, and he&#xD;
did so, expressing his great regret at not having&#xD;
been able to avail himself of it, and his apprecia-&#xD;
tion of the intended compliment.&#xD;
" I think you would have enjoyed yourself,"&#xD;
said Edna, "for I believe they all did. There&#xD;
were quite a number of charming young ladies&#xD;
present. Some of them, I think, you would have&#xD;
been pleased to meet."&#xD;
"Name them, if you please?"&#xD;
"Well--Miss Carver, from Boston, for one ;&#xD;
pretty, accomplished-"&#xD;
"And wealthy ? "&#xD;
" Pray, why do you ask such a question ?"&#xD;
"Is not that the supreme attraction ? "&#xD;
"What a sentiment for a poet! Do you know,&#xD;
Mr. Gildersleeve, that I never fail to read your&#xD;
verses in the Sentinel?"&#xD;
"Do you, really? You are a true friend, in-&#xD;
deed, Miss Heath, to sacrifice yourself to that&#xD;
extent. What an exertion it must be ! "&#xD;
" Indeed, I think some of them very nice.&#xD;

taste, endeavored to be very witty criticising some&#xD;
of your poetry, but Aunt Susan-that's Mrs.&#xD;
Applegate-Mercedita, and I defended you with&#xD;
our utmost ability, and we three decided that it&#xD;
was very nice indeed," said Edna earnestly.&#xD;
Mark thought that "very nice indeed " was not&#xD;
exactly the verdict he craved, nor were Aunt&#xD;
Susan and Mercedita critics whose judgment&#xD;
would likely bias public opinion, and be consid-&#xD;
ered final. Edna's good opinion was certainly&#xD;
worth having, however; and as for the Rev. Mr.&#xD;
Abbott's attempts at facetiousness, they were&#xD;
undoubtedly prompted by jealousy, and to say the&#xD;
least of it, were very unbecoming in one of his&#xD;
profession, and a disgrace to the cloth.&#xD;
" Mr. Abbott, though, is a very fine reader,"&#xD;
continued Edna, "but I must say I have not a&#xD;
very great opinion of his taste. Would u be-&#xD;
lieve it, he is forever reciting 'Airy, fairy IDian,'&#xD;
and says it's the finest thing Tennyson ever&#xD;
wrote? Now I think it's very flat, don't you?"&#xD;
Mark agreed with her, and said it was very flat,&#xD;
very flat indeed. She certainly has taste, thought&#xD;
he, great critical acumen, but I wish she wouldn't&#xD;
call my verses nice.&#xD;
&#xD;
tI&#xD;
&#xD;
"You must know," said Edna, who talked on&#xD;
unreservedly, "I'm a very romantic girl in spite&#xD;
of my matter-of-fact way, and read every bit 'of&#xD;
poetry I come across. In saying that I don't&#xD;
mean to disparage your productions, for as I said,&#xD;
I think some of them real nice and pretty. It&#xD;
may be that my opinion is not worth much, but&#xD;
one piece I read lately struck me as being full of&#xD;
beautiful ideas and similes. I mean those lines&#xD;
addressed to 'Eunomia,' the 'violet-engarlandid'&#xD;
person in 'purple cincture,' who, 'enthroned in&#xD;
the propylon of the temple of Fate, sweeps the&#xD;
lyre with skilful plectrum.' I believe that's the&#xD;
image, is it not ? "&#xD;
"I am afraid you are disposed to amuse your-&#xD;
self by ridiculing my poor efforts," said Mark, puz-&#xD;
zled to know whether she were in earnest or not.&#xD;
"Oh dear me, no. I haven't wit enough to be&#xD;
ironical, and am therefore always compelled to&#xD;
be downright and blunt. Do you know, too, that&#xD;
my ignorance is such that I had to look in the&#xD;
dictionary to find out what plectrum and propylon&#xD;
meant. Do, please, the next time you use such&#xD;
hard words, add explanatory notes at the foot,&#xD;
and oblige all such unlearned people as I."&#xD;

172&#xD;
&#xD;
MARK GILDERSLEEVE*&#xD;
&#xD;
She said this with a bantering smile that again&#xD;
perplexed Mark and set him reflecting. Now&#xD;
the shortest way to the Cliff was to turn off at&#xD;
Mill Street, which led to the foot-bridge over the&#xD;
falls; but when they came to the corner of that&#xD;
street, instead of turning off Edna kept on, taking&#xD;
the longer way home, and thus prolonging the&#xD;
walk, from which circumstance Mark augured&#xD;
favorably. At least, thought he, she is not tired&#xD;
of iy company as yet. Their promenade took&#xD;
them across the public square, a pretentious little&#xD;
triangle of grass-plats inclosed by posts and&#xD;
chains. At one end of this park fronted a fine&#xD;
large old mansion, whose low eaves, broad heavily-&#xD;
panelled door, and ponderous brass knocker de-&#xD;
noted work of the last century. It was the&#xD;
homestead of the Hull family, and on the door-&#xD;
jambs were still visible hacks made by the sabres&#xD;
of Knyphausen's Hessians. Mark and his com-&#xD;
panion had just passed the house when the old&#xD;
Judge came out on the porch to look at the ther-&#xD;
mometer hanging by the side of his door. How&#xD;
could he fail to notice the youthful couple? Old&#xD;
as he was, and long past the age of frivolity, they&#xD;
interested him, and he stood contemplating the&#xD;
&#xD;
MARK GILDERSLEEVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
173&#xD;
&#xD;
pair until they were out of his sight. , As he&#xD;
turned to renter the house he gave a sigh of re-&#xD;
gret. How barren seemed all his fame and hon-&#xD;
ors ! He would have bartered them all for the&#xD;
return of one hour of the sweet hallucinations of&#xD;
youth so irrevocably passed away. Meanwhile&#xD;
our young people continued their discussion on&#xD;
poetry in general, and Mark's productions in par-&#xD;
ticular, until the young man, assuming a serious&#xD;
expression, said, "You were speaking about the&#xD;
lines to Eunomia. As regards the spirit or in-&#xD;
tention in which they are composed, I must cer-&#xD;
tainly be credited at least with sincerity. Every&#xD;
line, every thought is an exponent of the author's&#xD;
feelings. They may be awkward, inelegant, or&#xD;
halting, but the words are nevertheless the earnest&#xD;
utterances of the heart."&#xD;
All this was'said fervently, and Edna replied:&#xD;
" I haven't any doubt of it at all. You poets all&#xD;
have some ideal lady-love, I believe, gifted with&#xD;
every possible quality ; some ethereal paragon&#xD;
whom you never permit to touch the earth; con-&#xD;
sequently, I presume you are very much dissatis-&#xD;
fied with young ladies as you find them."&#xD;
"Permit one to say you are much mistaken.&#xD;

My verses were addressed to no imaginary being.&#xD;
Eunomia lives and breathes."&#xD;
"Indeed! why, now that you have so excited&#xD;
my curiosity, I am afraid I shall not rest satisfied&#xD;
until I learn who this interesting damsel is-this&#xD;
purple-cinctured Eunomia,"&#xD;
"I can gratify you in that respect very readily,&#xD;
if you wish it."&#xD;
"Well-but--I wouldn't for the world be indis.&#xD;
creet. If it's perfectly permissible. Otherwise,&#xD;
let me remain in ignorance, please." She said&#xD;
this hesitatingly, as if perhaps she had gone&#xD;
too far ; or was it Mark's admiring gaze that&#xD;
embarrassed her? For the young man seemed&#xD;
to be oblivious of all but the being beside&#xD;
him, and who could blame him? for Edna,&#xD;
animated by the walk and conversation, looked&#xD;
more beautiful than ever. She wore a round&#xD;
hat wreathed about with a blue veil which&#xD;
contrasted charmingly with her fair complexion,&#xD;
and the satin sheen of her lustrous blonde hair.&#xD;
Mark watched the blithe face, and endeavored to&#xD;
analyze, and impress its beauty indelibly on his&#xD;
memory. What charmed him most was the vir-&#xD;
ginal grace of lips and chin, the pure cheek, and&#xD;
&#xD;
MARK GILDEEsLEEVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
175&#xD;
&#xD;
the exquisite contour of the slender white throat.&#xD;
So- absorbed was he in his admiration, that the&#xD;
promenade seemed to him incredibly short, in&#xD;
spite of the circuit they had made, for the en-&#xD;
trance to Mr. Heath's residence was now near at&#xD;
hand. It was time to part. "I am hesitating,"&#xD;
said he, "whether to reveal-if you will not&#xD;
think me presumptuous-after all, no one is&#xD;
better entitled to know the name of the one ad-&#xD;
dressed as 'Eunomia,' than you."&#xD;
"No one better entitled to know than I?" re-&#xD;
peated Edna, as a sudden enlightenment suffused&#xD;
her face with a blush.&#xD;
"No one; for Eunomia is but another name&#xD;
for Edna. Forgive me, if in seeking for inspira-&#xD;
tion from your beauty and goodness, I have been&#xD;
too bold in my admiration ; but Edna," he&#xD;
added, taking her hand and gazing at her with&#xD;
appealing ardor, "I have loved you so long and&#xD;
earnestly!"&#xD;
She- lowered her eyes at this declaration,.but&#xD;
her hand lingered in his. There was nobody&#xD;
near; he pressed her hand gently to his lips,&#xD;
when she -quickly withdrew it, and with a bow,&#xD;
disappeared through the gateway. Mark stood&#xD;

&#xD;
for a moment as if amazed at his audacity,&#xD;
and then, joyful and happy, walked away as if&#xD;
treading on air, bewitched by the delightful an-&#xD;
ticipations of newly implanted hope. Sweet&#xD;
anticipation! fHow full art thou of brilliant&#xD;
illusions and blissful glamour! And yet, without&#xD;

"BET you hundred to eighty-hundred dollars&#xD;

Heath's exclamations, as he stood rather unstead-&#xD;
ily in the bar-room of the Obershaw- House,&#xD;
thumping his fist on the counter. It was the&#xD;
night before election day, and of course the bar-&#xD;
room of the Obershaw House, the headquarters&#xD;
of Mr. Heath's party, was thronged with politi-&#xD;
cians and loungers, drinking, smoking, and dis-&#xD;
cussing the chances of the candidates for office;&#xD;
for we should state that the Ion. Rufus Heath&#xD;
had succeeded in his efforts to obtain the nomi-&#xD;
nation for the governorship, as the numerous&#xD;
posters on the dead walls of Belton, headed&#xD;
" CONSERVATIVE UNION NoMINATIoNs," staringly&#xD;
announced.&#xD;
Jack Heath had been for a week on what he&#xD;
called a "tare," and had but just "brought up"&#xD;
at the hotel. He was still a little "sprung," as&#xD;
the bar-tender qualified it, but had an eye to bus-&#xD;

iness nevertheless, as he seemed anxious to secure&#xD;
beds on his father's election. ".A hundred to&#xD;
eighty-bet any man hundred to eighty old man's&#xD;
'lected. Come, I'll make it hundred to fifty-&#xD;
fifty, who'll take that ? "&#xD;
" I will-just for a flyer," responded a short&#xD;
red-whiskered man, who kept a livery stable in&#xD;
the town; "I'll take it."&#xD;
"Put up the ducats, Hank-,put 'em up !&#xD;
Here, Bangs, old .fel, hold stakes, will you?&#xD;
All right-hundred to fifty more ! Who's next&#xD;
man?"&#xD;
"Here you are," said another individual.&#xD;
"Going to vote for the old man too, but P11 take&#xD;
your offer for the fun o' the thing."  .&#xD;
Jack fumbled away at his pocket-book, draw-&#xD;
ing out the bank-notes and laying them in Bangs&#xD;
the landlord's hand with drunken solemnity and'&#xD;
slowness. He found no lack of takers, and soon&#xD;
stripped himself of money to back his father's&#xD;
chances. Then a little contention arose about&#xD;
the count, and Jack indulged in a good deal of&#xD;
abuse and swearing. However, the party being&#xD;
in good humor, coaxed him, and vowed he was&#xD;
the best fellow alive; so Jack, mollified, ordered&#xD;
&#xD;
MARK GILDERSLEVE          1&#xD;
&#xD;
a basket of champagne to be opened, and "Here's&#xD;
to our next Governor, Rufus Heath!" was&#xD;
drunk with three times three and a "tiger."&#xD;
Then Jack, a little more inebriated, withdrew to&#xD;
play billiards, at which game he was an adept,&#xD;
and in spite of his condition he made some excel-&#xD;
lent caroms, better than many sober players could&#xD;
achieve ; but he also missed some easy shots, and&#xD;
his anger rising at that, he dashed his cue savage-&#xD;
ly at the table, ripping up the green cloth so that&#xD;
Bangs had it down on the bill ag inst him in no&#xD;
time. Then Jack ordered mor; wine, telling&#xD;
Bangs to charge it to the' old man's account for&#xD;
"'lection spenshes," and again the company were&#xD;
called upon to toast the future Governor of the&#xD;
" Jersey Blues," which they did vociferously.&#xD;
Now Jack, pulling out his watch, stared at it&#xD;
stupidly for some time, until a dim notion coming&#xD;
to him that he was too tipsy to discriminate be-&#xD;
tween the hands, he requested somebody to tell&#xD;
him the time. "Pas' twelve, eh? Time I was&#xD;
home-mus' go home early-got work to do to-&#xD;
morrow morning-old man's 'lection day."&#xD;
"Better stay here to-night, Mr. Heath," said&#xD;

you'll be fresh and fine for to-morrow's work."&#xD;
"All right, Tommy Bangs, old fel. Let's&#xD;

Whiskey-skins, Bangsey. Stiff, and not too sweet.&#xD;
Charge old man 'lection spenshes."&#xD;
The whiskey-skins being disposed of,Mfir. Bangs&#xD;
and his bar-tender led Jack tenderly up the&#xD;
stairs, and put him away comfortably to bed.&#xD;
About the time he awoke the next morning the&#xD;
election was in full blast. The population were&#xD;
entirely given over to the business, and Belton&#xD;
was emblazoned with multi-colored placards, call-&#xD;
ing upon the citizens to "awake," to "arouse,"&#xD;
and above all to" rally."  Wagons decorated with&#xD;
long muslin strips bearing the name of a promi-&#xD;
nent candidate, and some watchword of uncertain&#xD;
application, such as "No monopoly," "Working-&#xD;
men's Rights," and the like, were driven about&#xD;
gathering voters, who were stimulated to exercise&#xD;
the right of suffrage in the right direction by the&#xD;
stirring notes of a fish-horn; blown by an active&#xD;
partisan alongside of the driver.&#xD;
The polls were surrounded by a motley crowd&#xD;

of fellow-citizens, who beset the wayfarer with&#xD;
importunities to vote for this or that candidate ;&#xD;
and as each wagon drove up and deposited its&#xD;
load of voters the new-comers were received with&#xD;
hurrahs and friendly hustlings. The 'master of&#xD;

quitous, shouldering his burly frame through the&#xD;
thickest crowds, jeering his opponents, joking with&#xD;
his friends, and airing his wallet on the slight-&#xD;
est provocation. Jack Heath, owing to his ex-&#xD;
ertions on the previous evening, did not make his&#xD;
appearance on the scene of action until mid-day,&#xD;
but his presence infused new vigor in the contest.&#xD;
A crowd of henchmen were at his heels, and the&#xD;
bar of the Obershaw House dispensed strong&#xD;
waters and tobacco, galore and gratuitous, to all&#xD;
the supporters of the "Heath ticket " who chose&#xD;
to partake. And as many so chose, the bar-tender&#xD;
and his assistants had their hands full, you may&#xD;

those executors of the freeman's will, were scat-&#xD;
tered to the winds; and the ticket-distributors who&#xD;
were unlucky enough to be caught in their boxes&#xD;
found themselves suddenly in a topsy-turvy posi-&#xD;
tion, heels in the air, and kicking wildly to extri-&#xD;
cate themselves, to the intense enjoyment of the&#xD;
hilarious and playful electors. At sunset the&#xD;
polls closed, and the citizens who had rallied so&#xD;
nobly repaired to their homes, with the exception&#xD;
of some zealous politicians who remained to learn&#xD;
the result of the voting. The bar-rooms were&#xD;
still tumultuous with the wrangling of excited&#xD;
partisans, and Jack Heath lorded it at the&#xD;
Obershaw House, but he soon succumbed&#xD;
to the fatigues of the day, and was kindly&#xD;
put to bed by considerate Mr. Bangs at an&#xD;
early hour.&#xD;
The Hon. Rufus Heath remained at home dur-&#xD;
ing the eventful day. He had no doubt as to the&#xD;
result of the election, and felt certain that he&#xD;
would carry it. Candidates always feel so. The&#xD;
amazing self-conceit that induces every ticket-&#xD;
holder in a lottery to expect a prize would per-&#xD;
mit no other supposition than one of success.&#xD;
&#xD;
Still, being a cautious man, he was anxious to have&#xD;
his belief corroborated. Meanwhile so confident&#xD;
was he of the issue, that he employed himself in&#xD;
preparing a draught of his inaugural address, and&#xD;
revolving in his mind a proper disposition of his&#xD;
affairs preparatory to a removal of his home to&#xD;
the capital of the State. He anticipated, too, no&#xD;
little gratification in teaching his opponent a les-&#xD;
son, for he deemed it no less than a piece of im-&#xD;
pertinence that an obscure village lawyer, who&#xD;
had acquired some cheap fame by vulgar appeals&#xD;
as a stump speaker, should presume to cross&#xD;
swords with him in a contest for position. At&#xD;
length night came, and towards ten o'clock a mes-&#xD;
senger brought various returns that had been an-&#xD;
nounced, almost all indicating majorities in his&#xD;
favor. - He went to bed, but found it difficult to&#xD;
court slumber with such a stake still weighing in&#xD;
the balance. The next morning he became rather&#xD;
uneasy as the minutes passed and no friend came&#xD;
.to congratulate him on.the result. Mumble, he cer-&#xD;
tainly expected would have been on hand betimes.&#xD;
The newspaper, too, did not arrive at the usual&#xD;
hour, delayed probably to give the latest results&#xD;
of the canvassing. At length it came, and he saw&#xD;

at a glance from the returns of certain decisive&#xD;
counties that he was defeated.&#xD;
The editor endeavored to depreciate the impor-&#xD;
tance of these indications by stating that the final&#xD;
result was still in doubt; that later news might&#xD;
alter the complexion of things, etc. But Mr. Heath&#xD;
was not to be deluded by such assertions, and was&#xD;
convinced that he and his party had lost. As&#xD;
the first check in a career of uninterrupted pros-&#xD;
perity, it proved a bitter disappointment; so bitter,&#xD;
that he lost his temper-an unusual occurrence&#xD;
for him-swore at James for some trivial offence,&#xD;
snarled at Mrs. Applegate, and snubbed poor&#xD;
Mumbie, who had come rather blunderingly&#xD;
to sympathize with him. To one unaccustomed&#xD;
to obstacles and reverses they come with double&#xD;
severity, and Mr. heath took his defeat deeply to&#xD;
heart. Friends, to be sure, proffered condolen-&#xD;
ces, advising him to try again; that in the next&#xD;
attempt he would certainly be successful, etc.,&#xD;
etc.; but a sense of discouragement had taken&#xD;
possession of him which no sympathy or counsel&#xD;
could remove. Probably the bitterest pill to&#xD;
swallow was the discovery that his own county&#xD;
and town had given a large majority against him.&#xD;

He was much surprised at this, being utterly un-&#xD;
conscious of his personal unpopularity. Small&#xD;
comfort he got too from George Gildersleeve, who&#xD;
never spared a beaten adversary, and griping&#xD;
the patrician's hand when he met him a few days&#xD;
after, bade him be of good cheer in such words&#xD;
as these: " Sorry for you, Heath, but it couldn't&#xD;
be helped. I could have told you how it would&#xD;
be. Too much of the old Democratic leaven&#xD;
about here. This county cooked your mutton, and&#xD;
I carry it in my breeches pocket. Liked to have&#xD;
helped you-you're an old friend; but you can't&#xD;
expect us to desert our life-long principles, scratch&#xD;
our ticket, and go for outsiders when the woolly-&#xD;
heads are getting so rampant. There is no safety&#xD;
in these times but sticking to the old ship. But&#xD;
, I wouldn't be down in the mouth about it. If&#xD;
you'll only come round to our side of the house,&#xD;
S    I'll engage to send a good-looking man of about&#xD;
your size to Trenton or Washington. You ought&#xD;
to be there; you've got the brains, and have for-&#xD;
gotten more than half those fellers ever knew;&#xD;
but you ain't the right stripe, that's the trouble,&#xD;
and you're on the wrong track."&#xD;
Mr. Heath endeavored to take this advice good-&#xD;

IT was long past midnight, and betw&#xD;

when the stillness of the mansion on the c&#xD;
broken by a piercing shriek. It was an a&#xD;

lounge in the dressing-room to sleep. During&#xD;
the night he awoke ; tormented by the "horrors,"&#xD;
and thirsting for dome stimulating liquid, he&#xD;
seized a crystal flask of cologne that lay on the&#xD;
toilet-table, and drank it to appease the infernal&#xD;
craving that possessed him. The congested con-&#xD;
dition of his brain, super-excited by this fiery&#xD;
draught, induced apoplexy, and the stroke was&#xD;
fatal. His wife, asleep in the adjoining room,&#xD;
awoke soon after, and not hearing his usual&#xD;
heavy breathing, was much surprised. She ima-&#xD;
gined he must have left the room, and after&#xD;
waiting awhile, arose from her bed, went into&#xD;
the dressing-room where there was a dim light&#xD;
burning, and found that he had fallen from the&#xD;
lounge and lay on the floor.  She shook him&#xD;
without effect ; raised his arm-it fell rigidly.&#xD;
She tried to arouse him, called him loudly, but&#xD;
the dull ear heard not, for the sleep that bound.&#xD;
him knew no waking; and then, as the truth&#xD;
flashed on her, with a shriek she summoned the&#xD;
household. They led her away, agitated, proba-&#xD;
bly, more by terror than grief, but Mr. Heath&#xD;
remained gazing at the corpse of his only son.&#xD;
What a spectacle to meet a father's eye was this&#xD;
&#xD;
inert bulk, repulsive with the stigmas of dissipa-&#xD;
tion fresh upon it ! In the middle ages the heir&#xD;
of the house fell in battle, killed perhaps by the&#xD;
shot of an arquebuse or the blow of a partisan;&#xD;
or he met his death in some midnight encounter,&#xD;
and was brought home with a broken rapier and&#xD;
doublet dripping with blood-there is romance&#xD;
in that. But now he falls a victim to the bottle,&#xD;
and furnishes but a vulgar theme. Nevertheless&#xD;
the drama is none the less real. Mr. Heath's&#xD;
contemplation was sad, but full of worldly reason-&#xD;
ing. The curse of unearned wealth, he mused,&#xD;
has fallen on my son. Had he been the child of&#xD;
a bricklayer or born to labor, he would have&#xD;
been alive now ; or had not the blood of the&#xD;
Obershaws with its coarse appetites, predom-&#xD;
inated, he might have been an honor tome.&#xD;
Unmoved remained Mr. Heath as he philosophized&#xD;
thus, until the sight of his daughter's emotion, as&#xD;
she covered her dead brother's face with tears&#xD;
and kisses, stirred the parent within him, and his&#xD;
eyes clouded and cold features relaxed.&#xD;

age, though hardly perceptible in his still erect&#xD;
and vigorous frame, were telling on the springs&#xD;
of action.&#xD;
There are periods in a man's existence when he&#xD;
pauses to review his life. It is true such periods&#xD;
rarely occur to the slaves of vice, or to those un-&#xD;
der the dominion of a ruling passion, and perhaps&#xD;
never to the robust individual of limited ideas to&#xD;
whom the mere act of existing is a pleasure; but&#xD;
they come repeatedly to the free intellect, perhaps&#xD;
at the very instant of realization of some long&#xD;
toiled-for or expected success, or at the moment&#xD;
of disappointment, to ask it what it is living for,&#xD;
and whither it tends? Such questions never en-&#xD;
ter the head of men like old John Peter Ober-&#xD;
shaw, nor disturb the tough self-satisfaction of&#xD;
those like George Gildersleeve; but the texture of&#xD;
Mr. Heath's mind, when at rest, was impression-&#xD;
able, and its subtle energy liable to relax and&#xD;
weaken. We have related how he succumbed to&#xD;
despondency on his succession to the immense&#xD;
wealth of his father-in-law, and although this&#xD;
feeling was soon shaken off and banished in the&#xD;
pursuit of ambitious projects, it now returned as&#xD;
the blight on his ambition, and death of his only&#xD;
&#xD;
192&#xD;
&#xD;
son pressed the iron through a heart enamelled&#xD;
by worldliness. As time wore on, his sorrow, in-&#xD;
stead of diminishing, seemed to increase, and an&#xD;
expression of deep chagrin settled permanently&#xD;
on his countenance. He apparently lost a1l in-&#xD;
terest in his great work, the "Federal Code," and&#xD;
the secretary who had assisted him in its prepara-&#xD;
tion was dismissed.  He seldom left the house&#xD;
now, spending his time chiefly in the library en-&#xD;
gaged in meditation, or in the occasional perusal&#xD;
of a chapter of Jeremy Taylor or some other&#xD;
standard theological work. He even seemed to&#xD;
shun his family, and ceased to manifest interest&#xD;
in his daughter. Edna, quick to discern this&#xD;
change in her father's habits, attributed it solely&#xD;
to the death of her brother, and dreading the ef-&#xD;
fects of prolonged grief, strove with the assistance&#xD;
of her aunt to divert his mind ; but to little pur-&#xD;
pose. Each time that they tried to interest him&#xD;
in household matters, or to enliven him, they met&#xD;
with a rebuff. Even Mr. Abbott, who endeavored&#xD;
to bring balm and consolation, found his counsel&#xD;
unacceptable, and the worthy young minister did&#xD;
not repeat the attempt. In short, the man of&#xD;
even temper, the polished gentleman, wvas becon-&#xD;

ing irascible, and it was a relief to the family to&#xD;
learn one morning that Mr. Heath, to improve his&#xD;
health and divert his mind, or for some other un-&#xD;
explained reason, had determined to set off on a&#xD;
journey.&#xD;
Edna, too, had certain perturbations of mind&#xD;
and heart to contend with-ideas and reflections&#xD;
that would obtrude upon her, and that, although&#xD;
temporarily banished during the period of mourn-&#xD;
ing, reappeared with greater frequency when her&#xD;
sorrow became assuaged. These thoughts dated&#xD;
from the time of her meeting with Mark Gilder-&#xD;
$1eeve, when he avowed she inspired his poetic&#xD;
flights. In her simple estimation, his verses were&#xD;
productions of merit and beauty; and there was&#xD;
something extremely pleasing in the thought of&#xD;
having long been the object of the hidden admi-&#xD;
ration and laudation of a young man gifted with&#xD;
such talent, and splendid eyes. Fred Spooner, to&#xD;
be sure, was taller and had red cheeks, but then&#xD;
Fred's knowledge, although a Harvard under-&#xD;
graduate, did not seem to transcend dogs. He&#xD;
could entertain her only with the exploits of his&#xD;
bull-terrier Spot among the rats, or discuss the&#xD;
&#xD;
.d4 i&#xD;
&#xD;
beauties of his diminutive black-and-tan Spark;&#xD;
while Mark knew ever so many things, could&#xD;
quote Tennyson or Browning as readily as Mr.&#xD;
Abbott, could work a steam-engine, and sang&#xD;
superbly; while all Fred Spooner could do in that&#xD;
way was to roar, sadly out of tune, the touching&#xD;
lay of "The Lone Fish-ball," or "Shool."  Per-&#xD;
haps Mark might become, in time, as celebrated&#xD;
as Dante or Petrarch, and she would be immor-&#xD;
talized like Beatrice and Laura. Edna could not&#xD;
help dwelling on the flattering idea, until it took&#xD;
root in her gentle heart. In short, Miss Heath&#xD;
was fast drifting into love, and not a little sur-&#xD;
prised to find how constantly her thoughts would&#xD;
revert to the young engineer, in spite of "her ex-&#xD;
ertions to employ them otherwise. Perhaps,&#xD;
these exertions were not very strenuous, for the&#xD;
girl was of 'an unsophisticated nature, and not&#xD;
disposed to be rebellious; hence she yielded to her&#xD;
inclinations more readily than the circumspect&#xD;
daughter of a rigid precept-inculcating mamma.&#xD;
At this time the gigantic conspiracy of the&#xD;
Secessionists culminated, and the demon of Civil&#xD;
War, that Mr. Heath and his conservative coadju-&#xD;

tors had vainly attempted to exorcise, bristled his&#xD;
angry, crest. One morning the portentous news&#xD;
came that the first hostile shot had been fired by&#xD;
the South. Instantly, the faithful in all parts of&#xD;
the North sprang to arms to avenge the insult&#xD;
offered to the glorious old standard of the nation.&#xD;
Peaceful Belton partook of the patriotic ardor,&#xD;
and manifested its loyalty by a profuse display&#xD;
of bunting. Party differences were forgotten,&#xD;
and Republicans and Democrats, Free-soilers and&#xD;
Conservatives, native and foreign-born citizens, all&#xD;
joined in protesting their devotion to the Union,&#xD;
and their determination to defend it to the last.&#xD;
George Gildersleeve, who, moved by his antipa-&#xD;
thy to the abolitionists, had been inclined to ex-&#xD;
cuse the threats of the Southerners, now turned&#xD;
against them, and came out wonderfully strong&#xD;
for the Union, accompanying his loyal protes-&#xD;
tations with frequent allusions to the immortal&#xD;
Washington, and the patriotic services of his&#xD;
grandsire in the horse-shoeing line; in testi-&#xD;
mony whereof the Archimedes Works flaunted&#xD;
a starry banner of magnificent' dimensions. A&#xD;
mass-meeting of the citizens to take measures to-&#xD;
wards.the suppression of the rebellion was at. once&#xD;
&#xD;
L&#xD;
L&#xD;
&#xD;
held in the public square. This square was the&#xD;
pnyx or forum of the Beltonians. In the centre&#xD;
a Phrygian cap was borne skyward by a tall&#xD;
liberty-pole, whose base was defended by a rusty&#xD;
old carronade, which was popularly supposed to&#xD;
have done wonders in freedom's cause during the&#xD;
trying days of Seventy-six, and was venerated&#xD;
accordingly ; the probability being that it had&#xD;
never inflicted other damage than scorching&#xD;
some of the amateur artillerists, who every Fourth&#xD;
of July put the superannuated piece to use in&#xD;
firing salutes. At the meeting, though, it formed&#xD;
an appropriate buttress to the temporary stand&#xD;
erected for the orators, and gave a stern dignity&#xD;
to the occasion. In the absence of Judge Hull&#xD;
and Mr. Heath, who were both away from home,&#xD;
George Gildersleeve was called upon to preside;&#xD;
but fluent as honest George was in a caucus or&#xD;
sidewalk harangue, he lost his tongue on the&#xD;
rostrum, where he prefigured too closely his&#xD;
boasted porcine model of independence, and&#xD;
hence was forced to decline the proffered honor.&#xD;
Mr. Mumble was then pitched upon as a proper&#xD;
figure-head, but he also declined, having the fear&#xD;
of Mrs. Mumbie, whose sympathies were with&#xD;

the South, before his eyes. At length a chair-&#xD;
man was found in Mr. Poplin, the owner of the&#xD;
silk-mill, and the meeting proceeded with spirit.&#xD;
Stirring addresses were made-a deal of enthu-&#xD;
siasm evoked, and a string of resolutions passed&#xD;
unanimously. The practical result was the deci-&#xD;
sion to organize without delay a "Home Guard,"&#xD;
and George was appointed captain of the first&#xD;
company. Vague apprehensions were afloat&#xD;
among the staid denizens that Beauregard and&#xD;
the South Carolinians might invade Belton, and&#xD;
the patersfamilias of the town had made up their&#xD;
minds not to be caught unprepared, but to be&#xD;
ready to strike doughtily for their altars and fire-&#xD;
sides at a moment's notice. So in less than&#xD;
twenty-four hours, fifty-three good and true men&#xD;
were enrolled in this formidable legion, and com-&#xD;
mittees appointed to procure arms and uniforms.&#xD;
Considerable agitation was manifested over the&#xD;
selection of the latter. By virtue of his calling,&#xD;
Mr. Muldoon, a tailor, was chairman of the com-&#xD;
mittee on uniforms, and moved probably by per-&#xD;
sonal predilections, reported on." grane" as the&#xD;
most appropriate color ; from which Snopple,&#xD;
the minority, dissented, and recommended, with&#xD;
&#xD;
an eye to the picturesque, the old Continental&#xD;
blue and buff, with a cavalier "hat.  But this&#xD;
recommendation was not acted upon, the sug-&#xD;
gested costume being voted unsuitable for "hard&#xD;
service," and as the Guards intended adopt-&#xD;
ing the rifle as their weapon, Mr. Muldoon's&#xD;
"grane " carried the day, with red seams and yel-&#xD;
low facings, however, in deference to the esthetic&#xD;
feelings of the wily Snopple, who foresaw an in-&#xD;
crease of patronage growing out of this investiture.&#xD;
Among the junior members of the community,&#xD;
the warlike spirit rose equally high, but took a&#xD;
different direction. Of them all, none was more&#xD;
deeply stirred by the electric current of patriot-&#xD;
ism than Mark. From the outbreak of the con-&#xD;
flict, his blood tingled to join in the fray. He&#xD;
flung aside all other occupations, and threw his&#xD;
whole soul into the popular cause. Let us con-&#xD;
fess, though, that he was not purely unselfish in&#xD;
his eagerness, for he foresaw a new avenue to&#xD;
fame, and one where the goal was more accessi-&#xD;
ble to a determined mind than in the path he&#xD;
was pursuing. As a poet, mediocrity at the ut-&#xD;
I most was all, he was forced to admit, that he&#xD;
could ever hope for. But in war, what was there&#xD;

&#xD;
beyond the reach of a stout heart and true blade?&#xD;
He felt brave enough to cast his life in the scale&#xD;
if need be, and stake it for renown. Glory is a&#xD;
tempting bait for hot-heads and enthusiastic nat-&#xD;
ures, and its sway over Mark was irresistible.&#xD;
Beyond glory, too, there was a sweeter, dearer re-&#xD;
ward that he might win. A guerdon fit to nerve&#xD;
even a craven to prowess.&#xD;
"By cock and pie and mousefoot ! my lad,&#xD;
but this is serious," quoth Dr. Wattletop, when&#xD;
Mark imparted his intention of turning soldier.&#xD;
"Fired by bellicose ardor, we burn to seize the&#xD;
anlace and. cry havoc, eh ? Nonsense," was .the&#xD;
commentary that followed. "Believe me, my&#xD;
boy, stick to your innocent amusements. Per-&#xD;
mute the syllables of our noble tongue into new&#xD;
and strange rhythmical combinations as much as&#xD;
you please, but seek not the bubble reputation&#xD;
by checking musket-balls in their mad career.&#xD;
Stick to the shop, Mark, to itrochoidal paths and&#xD;
spheric sectors. 'Honor, indeed, who hath it?&#xD;
He that died o' Wednesday.' Stick to the shop,&#xD;
I tell you. You're a promising engineer, and&#xD;
there's glory enough to be acquired as such, and&#xD;
better still, money."&#xD;

"Very true, doctor," answered Mark with a&#xD;
smile. "That is an inducement.   You know&#xD;
how devoted I am to its acquisition."&#xD;
"More's the pity, my lad, more's the pity. The&#xD;
sceptre that rules the world in this century is a&#xD;
golden one. However, I was young myself once&#xD;
-long, long ago, I'm sorry to say-and can ap-&#xD;
preciate your sublime disdain of opulence. But&#xD;
what has started you o  on this new path, may I&#xD;
ask ?"&#xD;
"The duty I owe my country-patriotism," ex-&#xD;
claimed Mark rather proudly.&#xD;
" Patriotism-umph !  The last refuge of a&#xD;
scoundrel, as Dr. Johnson said. Have you no&#xD;
worthier motive? Forgive me, my boy, I don't&#xD;
intend any personal application-it's a quotation&#xD;
that occurred to me. But patriotism has an ex-&#xD;
ceedingly bad reputation, permit me to say, and is&#xD;
responsible for more crimes than liberty and re-&#xD;
ligion combined. Dulce et decorum est, and so&#xD;
forth, 'Fidelity to one's country right or wrong,'&#xD;
may be fine riiiging mottoes; but after all, the in-&#xD;
centive is vain and selfish. Patriotism is the pa-&#xD;
rent of national prejudice, and prejudices of all&#xD;
kinds are the greatest foes to justice. In the year&#xD;

&#xD;
A.D. 18,000, when 'man to man the wal o'er&#xD;
shall brithers be for a' that,' patriotism will be&#xD;
looked upon as a species of fetichism.' Patriotism!I&#xD;
I dislike it almost as much as I do generosity.&#xD;
Still,,if you must kill, kill for some other cause.&#xD;
Here you Yankees are breathing fire and slaugh-&#xD;
ter because a portion of four countrymen choose&#xD;
to follow the example of their forefathers. They&#xD;
are rebels and traitors and what not, because they&#xD;
follow in the footsteps of the men of '76, as you&#xD;
call them. The great question which underlies&#xD;
it all is apparently set aside and overlooked. The&#xD;
rallying cry is not the extinction of slavery; not&#xD;
freedom to fellow-beings from an undeserved ser-&#xD;
vitude; not justice; but the Union--whatever that&#xD;
may be-and patriotism forsooth ! the slogan that&#xD;
has marshalled unnumbered hosts to the perpe-&#xD;
tration of so many wrongs, and which is only, if&#xD;
I may so define it, disguised selfishness, as loyalty&#xD;
is after all but refined snobbishness."&#xD;
Now the doctor, although hating slavery, had a&#xD;
lurking sympathy for the South. To his mind,&#xD;
they were abstractly in the right; it was sheer&#xD;
inconsistency for a union of states the outgrowth&#xD;
of secession to prevent those among themselves&#xD;
&#xD;
who desired it from taking a similar action.&#xD;
iark, it is rue, while he had lately become to a&#xD;
certain exte t a proselyte to the teachings of the&#xD;
abolitionists, and admitted the wrong of slavery,&#xD;
and the necessity of wiping out that blot from the&#xD;
national escutcheon, made it subordinate to his&#xD;
great desire to preserve the Union and save from&#xD;
destruction "the greatest and freest country on&#xD;
earth, to which he had the honor to belong."&#xD;
" Is it the greatest and freest because you be-&#xD;
long to it?" inquired the doctor with a sly smile.&#xD;
"I notice that our great men are the greater for&#xD;
being our countrymen, and that our country is&#xD;
also the greater because it is our country. We&#xD;
love the person or thing that sheds glory or honor&#xD;
in any way upon us, more because it does so, than&#xD;
because it is glorious or honorable in itself. For&#xD;
instance the walls of Shakespeare's home are writ-&#xD;
ten over with the names of visitors. Now, why is&#xD;
this? What leads Snooks and Noakes to scrib-&#xD;
ble their names on the door-jambs of the shrine&#xD;
at Stratford-upon-Avon? Is it to honor Shake-&#xD;
speare or themselves ? Perhaps they cannot quote&#xD;
two lines of his works, perhaps have never even&#xD;
read them. It arises purely from that ignoble&#xD;

desire to gratify in some way the measureless&#xD;
vanity of man. Snooks and Noakes care noth-&#xD;
ing for Shakespeare, but the world recognizes him&#xD;
as a celebrity, and they by connecting themselves,&#xD;
in however remote a degree, with celebrity, fancy&#xD;
they thereby acquire an atom of it."&#xD;
"I don't see how any of this applies to me,"&#xD;
said Mark, seemingly a little hurt at the doctor's&#xD;
remarks. "I'm sure I am not actuated by any&#xD;
such small and contemptible motives.  Don't&#xD;
misunderstand me," he continued with rising&#xD;
enthusiasm; "I intend devoting myself to the&#xD;
cause of the Union, solely because I believe&#xD;
it to be the right one, and to carry justice&#xD;
with it."&#xD;
" Ah ! well-I like that way of putting it bet-&#xD;
ter," said the doctor. "You know, Mark, how I&#xD;
have always endeavored to imbue you with the&#xD;
belief, that to be just is the only rule of life, and&#xD;
that I should be sorry to see you swerve from&#xD;
that in any way."&#xD;
"But I do believe that the cause of the Union&#xD;
is the just one, and that of the Secessionists the&#xD;
unjust one. I also believe that ours involves the&#xD;
cause of freedom throughout the universe. Our&#xD;
&#xD;
country, doctor, is the beacon of light and hope&#xD;
to the oppressed of all nations."&#xD;
"So I've heard," said the doctor dryly, "and&#xD;
that millions yet unborn-and so forth. Well-&#xD;
well, my zealous young friend, bent on it, I see-&#xD;
G od be with you. I hope it will all turn out&#xD;
right. But Mark, how-how are you going?&#xD;
Will not your-your--" He hesitated, fearing he&#xD;
had trenched on delicate ground, for he reflected&#xD;
that the young manl's lameness might interfere&#xD;
with his project.&#xD;
"Of course," said Mark, guessing the remain-&#xD;
der of the question, "I prefer joining the cavalry."&#xD;
"Well, a wilful lad must have his way, I pre-&#xD;
sume, as well as a wilful woman. So boot and&#xD;
saddle, my boy, and may Southern steel and lead&#xD;
spare you to return to us, is the earnest wish of&#xD;
your old friend, Basil Wattletop. But whom&#xD;
shall I have to play chess with ? Have you&#xD;
thought of that?"&#xD;
" Ah! doctor, it's a grander game I shall en-&#xD;
gage in this time, but only as a pawn."&#xD;
" Why a pawn?"&#xD;
" Perhaps I shouldn't say that, for I'm striving&#xD;
for something better. You know I'm not alto-&#xD;

gether astray on horseback, and can ride, I&#xD;
believe, better than I can walk, which perhaps&#xD;
is not saying much; and old Copp, our night-&#xD;
watchman, who was sergeant-major during the&#xD;
Mexican war, and considered one of the best&#xD;
swordsmen in his corps, is teaching me sabre&#xD;
exercise, and if I only pass a fair examination at&#xD;
Trenton, I shall get a commission as lieutenant,&#xD;

"No fear but you'll make the effort. So it&#xD;

our nose now is continually in Jomini, or Cavalry&#xD;
Tactics, I'll warrant. That's our game now, my&#xD;
unappreciated genius, is it?"&#xD;
Mark smiled at his old friend's banter, for the&#xD;
inconstant had indeed given the Muses the cold&#xD;
shoulder, to pay his devoirs to fierce .Bellona.&#xD;
He even left uncompleted a stirring ode suited&#xD;
to the hour, entitled Tm  FASCES, destined to&#xD;
illuminate the columns of the Belton Sentinel,&#xD;
and which might have established his reputation&#xD;
as a second Korner. And wonderful was the&#xD;
zeal with which he set about qualifying himself&#xD;
for his new vocation. At break of day he was&#xD;
off scouring the roads on some mettlesome steed&#xD;

MARK GILDERBLEEVE. I&#xD;

&#xD;
to acquire a perfect seat, and the evenings he&#xD;
spent practising sword-cuts and6"moulinets"&#xD;
with old Copp, or poring over some volume on&#xD;
the art of war (which, to say the truth, proved&#xD;
of but little practical value to him), till long past&#xD;
midnight. Thanks to his perseverance, he soon&#xD;
had a smattering of the rudiments of the pro-&#xD;
fession of arms sufficient to enable him to pass&#xD;
an examination. This and a little of his brother's&#xD;
political influence, secured him a lieutenantey in&#xD;
the volunteer cavalry.&#xD;
George Gildersleeve, however, was not, at all&#xD;
pleased at the:prospect of parting with Mark, or&#xD;
rather with Mark's services, for he foresaw a vast&#xD;
increase of business for him growing out of&#xD;
the requirements of the War Department, and&#xD;
needed a valuable coadjutor now more than ever.&#xD;
He even went so far as to offer Mark a partner-&#xD;
ship in the Works if he would give up his inten-&#xD;
tion of joining the army and remain at work,&#xD;
which the young man, however, peremptorily&#xD;
refused. George, knowing the bent of his&#xD;
brother's character, saw the uselessness of further&#xD;
efforts to dissuade him from his purpose, and&#xD;

in strong terms, laying the chief blame upon his&#xD;
old enemies, the anathematized abolitionists, or&#xD;
" woolley-heads," as he ordinarily designated&#xD;
them. "He always has some dam whim or other&#xD;
in his head," said George, alluding to Mark.&#xD;
"Now it's nigger on the brain, and I believe he&#xD;
thinks more of freeing the darks than of saving&#xD;
the Union. So I'd rather he'd stay at home.&#xD;
It's all very well to go if he was wanted. I'm&#xD;

Dr. Wattletop had been to the "Shades" that&#xD;
afternoon, and made the following dignified reply,&#xD;
as he settled his chin in his swaddling cravat and&#xD;
shouldered his walking-stick like a drill-master:&#xD;
" In days gone by, Mr. Gildersleeve, in days gone&#xD;

loyal and steadfast, as it was your bounden duty,&#xD;
to your sovereign King George of glorious mem-&#xD;
ory, you would now have formed part of the&#xD;
mightiest and grandest empire on which the&#xD;
sun ever shone, and enjoying and sharing in true,&#xD;
sound, conservative, and constitutional freedom.&#xD;
There would have been no strife or fratricidal&#xD;
war in regard to slavery, for slavery cannot exist&#xD;
on British soil; but you chose to rebel against&#xD;
righteous authority, and now, the monster you&#xD;
have conjured threatens to devour you. Sorry&#xD;
for you, very sorry; but permit me to say frankly&#xD;
that you deserve it all  You certainly deserve it&#xD;
all, and have brought it on yourselves ;" and the&#xD;

doctor shook his head very decidedly, as if, while&#xD;
he could not entirely forgive the American na-&#xD;
tion, he might be willing to temper his judgment&#xD;
with mercy.&#xD;
The master of the Archimedes Works was at&#xD;
a loss, for a moment, how to reply to this unex-&#xD;
pected philippic; but finally drove his adversary&#xD;
off by asserting, rather vehemently, that the&#xD;
American people intended settling their family&#xD;
difficulties in their own way, and if John Bull&#xD;
attempted to interfere he would get a repetition&#xD;
of the warming Old Hickory gave him at New&#xD;
Orleans.&#xD;
" Or at Bladensburg, mayhap," added the doc-&#xD;
tor, as he walked away, convinced that his part.&#xD;
ing shot was an extinguisher, and chuckling as&#xD;
he muttered "Ho habet! hoc habet !"&#xD;

Tam regiment to which Mark had been as-&#xD;
signed recruited chiefly in Belton from among&#xD;
the artisans, and sons of the neighboring farmers,&#xD;
and it was not long before the complement 'was&#xD;
made up. As time was precious at this juncture&#xD;
the regiment was directed to proceed without&#xD;
delay to Washington, to join the corps forming&#xD;
under Kearney.&#xD;
A parting surprise had been prepared for&#xD;
Mark by the men at the Works, who had contrib-&#xD;
uted to purchase a handsome sword, which was&#xD;
presented to the young lieutenant a few days&#xD;
previous to his departure. Work was suspended&#xD;
two hours before the usual time, and Knatchbull,&#xD;
foreman of the machine-shop, and the oldest man&#xD;
at the Works, was deputed to make the present&#xD;
tion speech. He was an Englishman, but heart&#xD;
and soul with the country of his adoption. Un-&#xD;
fortunately, to American ears, his eloquence was&#xD;
marred somewhat by a strong Northumbrian&#xD;

burr. Nevertheless, it was not ineffective, and&#xD;
Mark, who was totally unprepared for such a&#xD;
manifestation, had his feelings so touched by this&#xD;
exhibition of friendship for him by his late asso-&#xD;
ciates, that he was unable to make a coherent&#xD;
reply. He thanked them with a full heart, and&#xD;
one and all, big. and little, shook hands with&#xD;
him; then shouted themselves hoarse, until&#xD;
George Gildersleeve, who had become reconciled&#xD;
to. Mark's leaving, and even promised him the&#xD;
finest charger, money could buy, delivered his&#xD;
sentiments in the following pithy address:&#xD;
"Mark Gildersleeve! remember the man whose&#xD;
horse wore that old shoe over there (pointing to the&#xD;
fire-place in the counting-room), and remember&#xD;
your grandfather who shod him just afore the&#xD;
great battle of Trenton, and stand by the old flag,&#xD;
now and forever! That's all. Now boys we've&#xD;
had enough chin-music; step upstairs and wet.&#xD;

And up they all went into the 1  , here the&#xD;
consumption of pun   , c ampagne, and .sand-&#xD;

" Rally round the Flag," whose stentorious strains&#xD;
were borne across the Passaic to reverberate and&#xD;
die amid the distant Preakness hills.&#xD;
The eve of departure was at hand. Mark had&#xD;
not had any interview or communication with&#xD;
Miss Heath since her brother's death. He had&#xD;
seen her several times, either at church or while&#xD;
she was riding, and exchanged salutation , but&#xD;
had not attempted to visit her. But now, he&#xD;
could forego it no longer. Clad in a bran-new&#xD;
uniform, that displayed his square shoulders and&#xD;
sinewy waist to advantage, he went with palpitat-&#xD;
ing heart to the Cliff to take leave of Edna. He&#xD;
hoped to be fortunate enough to see her alone.&#xD;
He had not long to wait in the vast drawing-&#xD;
room, when light footsteps announced the young&#xD;
lady. She looked slender in her black dress, and&#xD;
rather pale, but a light blush mantled her features&#xD;
as she received him with a cordial smile. He&#xD;
colored in response, and their looks spoke volumes&#xD;
to each other.&#xD;
" I-I trust," said Mark, "the audacity of -my&#xD;

"You seem determined to remind me of it at&#xD;
all events," replied Edna, parrying the question,&#xD;
and withdrawing her hand from his, as she&#xD;
motioned him to. a chair. She took a seat oppo-&#xD;
site to him on a sofa, composing the folds of her&#xD;
dress in a nonchalant way, as if she feared having&#xD;
betrayed too much gratification in her greeting.&#xD;
There was an awkward pause for a moment.&#xD;
Then Mark, exchanging his seat for one beside&#xD;
Edna, and arming himself with persuasive audac-&#xD;
ity, took up her words. "Remind you, Edna?&#xD;
Oh ! could I but impress you with a faint idea of&#xD;

control my wishes, ambition, aspirations-my&#xD;

as a priceless boon."\&#xD;
Edna attempted to frame some coy reply, but&#xD;

ardor of such an impetuous wooer. She could&#xD;

only remain silent, with lowered glance and&#xD;

tinued, "I may be exceedingly presumptuous in&#xD;
aspiring to you, Edna. I have nothing to offer,&#xD;
and I know you deserve all that earth can give,&#xD;
but all I ask now, is to be permitted to hope, and&#xD;
meanwhile to worship, for no divinity is too ex-&#xD;

your consent and encouragement; without that,&#xD;
the task I have undertaken will be purposeless,&#xD;
and all honor I might win prove barren. I have&#xD;

"Farewell," echoed Edna, raising her eyes to his.&#xD;
"Yes,".said Mark, "to-morrow morning I leave&#xD;
for Virginia, and I've come to bid you farewell,&#xD;
and beg some token-some favor, Edna, which I&#xD;
know you will not refuse me; and if it should be&#xD;
my fate never to return-"&#xD;
"Oh, don't say that," exclaimed Edna in tones&#xD;
that betrayed her anxiety.&#xD;
"I trust I shall return, Edna, and in a position&#xD;
to make me more worthy of the interest you man-&#xD;
ifest in me. Dearest, the sweet confession I read&#xD;
in your eyes--in your tell-tale blushes, nerves me&#xD;

Mark was getting along famously in the time-&#xD;
honored way, when, at this tender stage of affairs,&#xD;
who should make her unwelcome appearance but&#xD;
Aunt Applegate, fortunately a myopic matron,&#xD;
who underwent an introduction to Mark, without&#xD;
seemingly noticing the confused looks of the sen-&#xD;
timental pair. A voluble dame luckily was&#xD;
Mrs. ,Applegate, who had known Mark's mother&#xD;
and several of his dead and gone relatives, and&#xD;
instantly resurrected many incidents and remi-&#xD;
niscences connected with the existence of those&#xD;
personages, thereby giving Edna time to assume&#xD;
a properly demure countenance. Our budding&#xD;
warrior and lover, while feigning an hypocritical&#xD;
interest in the conversation of the intruding lady,&#xD;
would, we fear, have seen her led off to the rack&#xD;
or stake with glee and' gratitude. In happy un-&#xD;
consciousness of the kind feelings towards her,&#xD;
Mrs. Applegate continued, touching upon the pre-&#xD;
vailing topic: "So you are going to the war,&#xD;
Mr. Gildersleeve? Isn't it dreadful? Dear me,&#xD;
I don't know how it will all end. Edna told ne&#xD;
you had joined the cavalry, and I think you are&#xD;
very sensible in doing so, for you have a great&#xD;
advantage over the foot-soldiers, and if worst&#xD;

comes to the worst, and matters become serious,&#xD;
you can, in case of danger, always get away from&#xD;
it much faster. Edna said-I believe you read it&#xD;
in the paper, didn't you, dear? Yes. So I&#xD;
thought-that you were ' a lieutenant. Now I&#xD;
should think that was doing very well for so short&#xD;
a time. Mrs. Mumbie is so worried about De-&#xD;
catur. He is at the Naval School, you know,&#xD;
and she is afraid he may have to go and fight.&#xD;
She's a Southerner, and all her sympathies are&#xD;
with the South," etc., etc.&#xD;
Mrs. Applegate continued in this strain for&#xD;
some time, duly impressing on Mark the necessity&#xD;
of keeping his feet dry upon all occasions, and&#xD;
avoiding damp ground as a couch. She offered&#xD;
furthermore to present him with a quart bottle&#xD;
of picra, a remedial agent of great virtue and&#xD;
nastiness. "I prepared it myself, and am never&#xD;
without it, and wouldn't ~be for anything. Mr.&#xD;
Applegate used to say, 'Now, Susan, if you'd&#xD;
only advertise it, you'd make your fortune.' It's&#xD;
the very best thing in the world to ward off chills&#xD;
and fever; and now I think of it, Mr. Gilder-&#xD;
sleeve, if you could introduce it in the army, and&#xD;
induce the soldiers to take it occasionally instead&#xD;

of their vile whiskey and brandy, what a blessing&#xD;
it would be! I'm sure for my part nothing would&#xD;
give me greater pleasure than to furnish the re-&#xD;
cipe. lNow, if you'll bear this in mind, and&#xD;
write me, I'll send it to you at any time."&#xD;
Mark promised to do so; he would have prom-&#xD;
ised anything, even to taking a daily dose of picra&#xD;
for a month, if Mrs. Applegate would only have&#xD;
allowed him a few minutes' longer tete-d-tate with&#xD;
his sweetheart, but it was not to be, and he was&#xD;
about to take his leave when Mrs. Applegate re-&#xD;
quested him to stay to tea, an invitation which he&#xD;
gladly accepted. The Fmeal was rather a stiff&#xD;
and ceremonious affair, but Mark was supremely&#xD;
happy as he sat next to Edna. Mr. Heath, who&#xD;
had returned from his journey apparently not&#xD;
much improved in health, was rather mystified at&#xD;
the young officer's presence, and stared somewhat&#xD;
at his shoulder-straps. Mark noticed that the&#xD;
patrician had lost much of his old rigid pride, and&#xD;
looked fatigued and care-worn. He appeared to&#xD;
take but little interest in the momentous events&#xD;
of the day, and his one or two listless questions&#xD;
betrayed a remarkable ignorance of what was&#xD;
going on around him in relation to the war.&#xD;
&#xD;
After tea they withdrew to the parlors, with the&#xD;
exception of Mr. heath, who retired to his room.&#xD;
Mrs. Applegate, complimenting Mark on his&#xD;
voice,requested him to favor her with "Angels&#xD;
ever bright and fair;" which the young fellow&#xD;
did, you may rest assured, to the very best of his&#xD;
ability, as he sang to Edna's accompaniment. Then&#xD;
other visitors came. First, the Rev. Spencer&#xD;
Abbott, somewhat amazed, and perhaps a little&#xD;
displeased at Mark's presence, but too well bred&#xD;
to show it; next, Bob Mumbie and his sister&#xD;
Ada, to whom Mark underwent an introduction-&#xD;
an embarrassing ceremony where all the parties&#xD;
have known each other from childhood, but tac-&#xD;
itly agreed as they grew up to be as strangers.&#xD;
However, the ice was soon'broken. The young&#xD;
rector was pleasant enough and had a batch of&#xD;
entirely new conundrums to offer. Bob Mumbie,&#xD;
though rather doltish, was a good-natured, amus-&#xD;
ing fellow, while Miss Ada chose to make herself&#xD;
unusually agreeable, succumbing, perhaps, to the&#xD;
potent fascination of the lieutenant's blue coat and&#xD;
gilt buttons. She was a rather pretty girl, with&#xD;
a clear brunette complexion; but strongly marked&#xD;
brows knit over brilliant black eyes, and disdain..&#xD;

ful lips, gave her an imperious expression. She&#xD;
attacked a sonata of Beethoven, but it was evi-&#xD;
dently beyond the capacity of her unpractised&#xD;
fingers, and it was a relief when her brother of-&#xD;
fered to treat the company to "The Old Folks at&#xD;
Home." Bob Mumbie's forte: was Ethiopian&#xD;
minstrelsy, and he sang the simple lays of the&#xD;
plantation with all the pathos of a professional.&#xD;
Led on by the general applause, Bob followed it&#xD;
up with "Old Uncle Snow," then "Sally Come&#xD;
up," and concluded with a "Walk round," after&#xD;
the manner of the celebrated Mr. Bryant, to the&#xD;
intense amusement of Mrs. Applegate, whose&#xD;
capacious form shook with laughter, and of Edna,&#xD;
who enjoyed it scarcely less. All this was hor-&#xD;
ridly' unaesthetic, and Mark, the prig, only re-&#xD;
warded the performance with a condescending&#xD;
smile. Perhaps, was he jealous that his efforts&#xD;
had not met with equal success, or that Edna had&#xD;
requested a repetition of "Uncle. Snow"? For&#xD;
all that, and in spite- of it, he enjoyed himself,&#xD;
and passed a delightful evening ; one that he often&#xD;
recalled as he smoked his corn-cob pipe and rum-&#xD;
inated before the lonely bivouac-fires during the&#xD;
tedious Peninsular campaign.&#xD;

Mark was grievously disappointed though,&#xD;
when about taking his leave that evening, to find&#xD;
Mrs. Applegate accompanying her niece to the&#xD;
door to press on his acceptance a large bottle of&#xD;
piera. He was fain to content himself with 'ex-&#xD;
changing a lingering pressure of the hands and&#xD;
an eloquent look with Edna. She found means,&#xD;
however, to give him a small folded paper which&#xD;
of course contained, to his supreme delight, a&#xD;
tress of her bonny blond hair. Any one witness-&#xD;
ing his behavior as he went home that night,&#xD;
stopping every moment to cover the precious&#xD;
keepsake with kisses, and then as he crossed the&#xD;
bridge to, the town, to fling a bottle rather im-&#xD;
patiently into the river, might reasonably have&#xD;
entertained doubts as to his sanity.&#xD;
And the sweet enchantress who had cast this&#xD;
spell? She was rather startled when stopping&#xD;
at her father's room to bid him good-night, he&#xD;
abruptly asked her what that young man had&#xD;
called for? Fortunately he did not notice her&#xD;
deep color as she answered that he had merely&#xD;
come to bid them good-by, and Aunt Susan had&#xD;
asked him to stay to tea.&#xD;

&#xD;
good-night, darling," was all Mr. Heath remarked,&#xD;
an d Edna was much relieved when she discovered&#xD;
her father's curiosity extended no farther. But&#xD;
what a long serious meditation she had after re-&#xD;
tiring to her room! How often she stopped and&#xD;
reflected as she braided her hair for the night!&#xD;
She was now fairly in love. This last step of&#xD;
Mark's had achieved her conquest. What young&#xD;
lady with any kind Qf a heart could resist the&#xD;
fascination' of a gallant who was both a poet and&#xD;
soldier? And not only that, but who had the&#xD;
finest black eyes and chiselled features conceiv-&#xD;
able? Even Ada Mumbie, who had never con-&#xD;
descended to, notice him before, was now forced&#xD;
to admit that he looked "splendid" in his uniform.&#xD;
Edna had read of Sidney, and fancied Mark&#xD;
must be just such another individual as that&#xD;
model knight. As for Fred Spooner, who wrote&#xD;
her such school-boy scrawls from Harvard, what&#xD;
was there chivalrous about him? But Mark&#xD;
could only be compared to one, of those delightful&#xD;
mailed beaux of old who went ambling about&#xD;
the world smiting every one who didn't instantly&#xD;
acknowledge that their own particular ladylove&#xD;
was vastly superior to all other ladyloves in ex..&#xD;
&#xD;
istence; and she hadn't any doubt but that Mark&#xD;
was ready to enter the lists at a moment's notice&#xD;
for such a purpose; and we may add that we&#xD;
do not think she was much mistaken in her belief&#xD;
either. So she decided in her mind that as soon&#xD;
as she was nineteen, and Mark became a general,&#xD;
which would doubtless be contemporaneous events,&#xD;
they would be married. Then a sad expression&#xD;
shadowed her face, as the thought crossed her&#xD;
mind that perhaps he might fall in battle. When&#xD;
she knelt at her bedside in her vestal robe, an&#xD;
appeal for the protection and safe return of the&#xD;
young lieutenant was not omitted, we will vent-&#xD;
ure to say.&#xD;
The sun came out bright and encouragingly&#xD;
the next morning, when a clear bagle-call roused&#xD;
the recruiting camp on- the outskirts of Belton.&#xD;
The men vere under order to leave for Washing-&#xD;
ton by an early train. It was a memorable day&#xD;
for the -town, and the citizens assembled to see&#xD;
the gallant lads off. The cavalry-men were dis-&#xD;
mounted, lightly equipped with blankets and&#xD;
haversacks, while their officers carried  their&#xD;
sabres with all the pride of veterans. They de-&#xD;

filed through the principal streets on their way to&#xD;
the railway-station, accompanied by the "Home&#xD;
Guard," and preceded by the Belton brass-band&#xD;
ringing out " John Brown's march," while the&#xD;
people cheered lustily. There was Mark with&#xD;
his cap bearing its insignia of crossed sabres set&#xD;
jauntily on one side of his head, marching proudly&#xD;
along, unmindful for the moment of his halting&#xD;
gait, which was more apparent than usual, as he&#xD;
kept step with the even ranks. As his eyes wan-&#xD;
dered towards the throng on the sidewalks, he&#xD;
caught sight of the figure of a young girl closely_&#xD;
wrapped in a dark shawl. It was Edna; and as&#xD;
she stealthily waved her handkerchief he colored&#xD;
to the temples, bowed an acknowledgment, and&#xD;
so they parted.&#xD;
More leave-takings at the depot. Poor Mrs.&#xD;
Gildersleeve sobbing like a child, until her hand-&#xD;
kerchief was soaked in tears, and her husband,&#xD;
the bold captain of the "Home- Guards," feeling&#xD;
probably almost as bad, but affecting an exag-&#xD;
gerated bluffness, and proffering the rather un-&#xD;
Smilitary advice to Mark to "stand no nonsense&#xD;
and look out for number one." Then Dr. Wattle-.&#xD;
top had his good word of cheer and encouragement&#xD;

for young Rupert, as he called him; and the Rev.&#xD;
Mr. Sniffen said his kind say; and lastly, old&#xD;
Copp gave him a parting grip, whose intense&#xD;
heartiness nearly brought tears into his eyes.&#xD;
All this solicitude shown in his behalf, and re-&#xD;
gret expressed at his departure by his friends&#xD;
caused Mark to feel as if he didn't deserve it at&#xD;
all, and was rather an ungrateful wretch in going&#xD;
away. "What shall I do to merit all this?" was&#xD;
his reflection as the train sped on that bore him&#xD;
off. "I must not disappoint them, and I shall&#xD;
not. No, I'll not enter Belton again if the war&#xD;
lasts until I can wear spread-eagles on my shoul-&#xD;
der-straps, unless I am brought in on a stretcher,"&#xD;
vowed be, thinking probably that in either event&#xD;
the expectations of his friends would be met and&#xD;
his condition a source of satisfaction to them.&#xD;
Time passed on with Edna, measured only by&#xD;
the intervals between the receipt of letters from&#xD;
Mark. These missives were of course frequent&#xD;
and fervid, and responded to in as nearly similar&#xD;
a strain as maidenly reserve would permit.&#xD;
There was nothing particularly novel or striking&#xD;
in Edna's letters, but Mark esteemed them as&#xD;
a  compositions of wonderful merit. He believed&#xD;

he saw in her well-balanced sentences, and neat,&#xD;
flowing penmanship a reflex of her natty ways&#xD;
and symmetric character. These precious 'notes&#xD;
he always carried about him, and they were read&#xD;
and re-read until he knew their contents by heart.&#xD;
Edna,.on her part, made as absorbing a study of&#xD;
her lover's correspondence.&#xD;
Mark was with the Army of the Potomac in its&#xD;
memorable campaign in the Peninsula. Promo-&#xD;
tion was rapid among the volunteers, and he was&#xD;
soon advanced to a captaincy. By this time he&#xD;
had been in several engagements, and behaved&#xD;
with credit. Naturally, at his first experience of&#xD;
actual warfare, he was uncertain of himself, and&#xD;
dreaded lest his heart should fail him. The&#xD;
gravity of the commanders at the approach of&#xD;
battle; the sullen boom of distant cannon draw-&#xD;
ing nearer and nearer-the preliminary pause&#xD;
inspires the novice with dread and awe ; but the&#xD;
first flutter of fear over, the sharp crack of rifles&#xD;
and smell of powder soon kindles the blood of a&#xD;
true soldier, and Mark found himself in his ele-&#xD;
ment, oblivious of danger, and dashing with the&#xD;
foremost into the fight.&#xD;
He was chary of imparting his own exploits,&#xD;
&#xD;
but Edna heard of them occasionally through the&#xD;
public prints, which she diligently scanned every&#xD;
day for news from the -th New Jersey Cav-&#xD;
alry. Once she had a fearful fright, for she&#xD;
found Captain Mark Gildersleeve's name among&#xD;
the wounded. But, to her relief, a letter from&#xD;
him came soon after, which informed her that&#xD;
the injury he had received was but slight, and&#xD;
that het expected to be in the saddle again in a&#xD;
few days. The truth was, that our hero's career&#xD;
had come within an ace of an untimely close.&#xD;
While out on a reconnoissance, his troop had&#xD;
fallen in with a portion of Jeb Stuart's horse,&#xD;
and Mark, who had often longed for an oppor-&#xD;
tunity for a hand-to-hand combat with some of&#xD;
the noted Southern troopers, drew his sabre and&#xD;
rode with reckless impetuosity into the midst of&#xD;
the enemy. He was about to single out an adver-&#xD;
sary, as if to engage in a joust, when he was in?&#xD;
stantly surrounded and a stroke dealt at him which&#xD;
only the stoutness of his leathern cap-visor pre-&#xD;
vented from terminating his existence. As it&#xD;
was, the gash he received was a serious one; but&#xD;
fortunately his companions had arrived in time to&#xD;
rescue 'him from further peril, and disperse the&#xD;

rebels. The wound soon healed, but it left a&#xD;
scar which, though it rather impaired his good&#xD;
looks, he deemed a favor for this reason: since&#xD;
he had been in the army he was ,often subjected&#xD;
to the query, suggested by his lameness, of where&#xD;
and how he had been wounded; the embarrass-&#xD;
ment of an explanation and the recollections re-&#xD;
vived by it, were such as to cause him to accept&#xD;
with gratitude the ugly seam that now disfigured&#xD;
him, but would thenceforth probably divert the&#xD;
attention of inquisitive persons from his other&#xD;
physical defect.&#xD;
Mark wrote to Edna in a pleasant, jesting way&#xD;
concerning the embellishment his countenance&#xD;
had undergone. He promised to send her a like-&#xD;
ness of his improved appearance at the first op-&#xD;
portunity, and alluded to the wound he had re-&#xD;
ceived from the rebel trooper as a mere pin&#xD;
scratch in comparison with the one inflicted by her&#xD;
on his heart, with much more to the same pur-&#xD;
pose, and signed himself " Le Balafr,"&#xD;
Edna was pleased to find that he took it all in such'&#xD;
good part, and replied beseeching him not to ex-&#xD;
pose himself so rashly-she was certain he was&#xD;
rash and reckless, and for her sake to be cautious&#xD;
&#xD;
and prudent, ending with the hope that the war&#xD;
would soon end, and enable him to return home.&#xD;
Beside her solicitude for Mark, the girl's&#xD;
thoughts were greatly occupied with her father's&#xD;
changed health and habits. Despite his cold,&#xD;
undemonstrative temperament, Mr. Heath was&#xD;
strongly attached to his child. If his manifesta-&#xD;
tions of affection had been few and far between,&#xD;
on the other hand he had never chidden her, and&#xD;
she had been indulged inevery way, and her&#xD;
lightest wishes gratified.  The daughter more&#xD;
than reciprocated the love so charily bestowed,&#xD;
and her impressionable nature seemed to reflect&#xD;
her father's changeful moods. Now her intuition&#xD;
told her that he suffered. He had not been the&#xD;
same man since the death of his son. At times&#xD;
he shook off his despondency, and appeared to&#xD;
regain some of his former energy; but the effort&#xD;
was but momentary. His business matters were&#xD;
now entirely conducted by others, and he even&#xD;
grew neglectful of his personal appearance-a&#xD;
symptom that struck Edna with alarm.   One&#xD;
morning when he breakfasted with the family in&#xD;
his dressing-gown and with an unshaven face,&#xD;
Edna, after he had left the table, remarked to&#xD;

her aunt on the great alteration in her father's&#xD;
habits: " I never knew him to do such a thing&#xD;
before. Yesterday afternoon I saw him go into&#xD;
the picture-gallery, and I went in very soon after.&#xD;
He was staring fixedly at that picture of the Sis-&#xD;
tine Madonna, and did not notice my coming in.&#xD;
When I went and spoke to him he started with&#xD;
such a pained expression that it made me feel&#xD;
dreadful."&#xD;
"My dear child," said Mrs. Applegate in a re-&#xD;
assuring tone, "you must bear in mind that your&#xD;
father is getting old. You can't expect him al-&#xD;
ways to remain smart and active. Years will tell&#xD;
on all of us. Besides, everybody has something&#xD;
the matter with them; if it isn't one thing it's an-&#xD;
other. Now Mr. Applegate used to say that gout&#xD;
or rheumatism was more certain if not so desirable&#xD;
as riches, and I know that years before he died---"&#xD;
"But, aunt," interrupted Edna, "father is not&#xD;
so very old. I do not think his condition is natu-&#xD;
ral. I feel sure he suffers very much; II know it.&#xD;
Whenever I talk to him he don't seem to be&#xD;
aware of what I am saying. I often write letters&#xD;
to him as I used to, on some subject that I think&#xD;
will interest him, but he lays them aside without&#xD;
&#xD;
opening them. I can always tell whenever any-&#xD;
thing ails him; and besides, his last trip did not do&#xD;
him a bit of good.' He broods so constantly over&#xD;
Jack's death, and seems so very miserable, that it&#xD;
makes me feel dreadful to see him; and then, if&#xD;
I ask him if he feels ill, he seems so annoyed, that&#xD;
I dare not question him further. I am afraid&#xD;
that unless something is done his .health will be&#xD;
seriously affected. Do send a note to Dr. Wattle-&#xD;
top to come and see him."&#xD;
"As you please, dear; but you know how&#xD;
strongly your father objects to having anything&#xD;
to do with doctors, and how angry he may be if&#xD;
he finds out we have taken such a step without&#xD;
consulting him. So we must expect a scolding."&#xD;
"Never mind, aunt; I'll take all the blame on&#xD;
my shoulders," replied Edna. "I certainly feel it&#xD;
is our duty to ask some physician's advice. Sup-&#xD;
pose you ask Dr. Wattletop to call; you might&#xD;
say you wished to consult him in case an ex-&#xD;
cuse is needed. Then you could explain the mat-&#xD;
ter to the doctor without alarming or annoying-&#xD;
father in the least. wouldn't that do ?"&#xD;
"Well, my dear, perhaps it might. At all&#xD;
events, I'll send the doctor a note, and ask him&#xD;
&#xD;

what we had better do. There can be no harm&#xD;
in that."&#xD;
Dr. Wattletop came as requested under pretext&#xD;
of prescribing for Mrs. Applegate. He remained&#xD;
to dine, and was seated opposite Mr. Heath,&#xD;
who replied to the customary inquiries respecting&#xD;
his health with a curt and nervous, "Thank you,&#xD;
never better, never better."  But he was so un.&#xD;
easy beneath the physician's big interrogative eyes&#xD;
so constantly directed toward him, that he feigned&#xD;
some excuse, and left the table before the end of&#xD;
the meal.&#xD;
The physician was struck with the marked&#xD;
alteration in Mr. Heath's aspect. That energetic,&#xD;
refiled aristocrat, had suddenly become a listless,&#xD;
peevish old man. His keen ice-gray eyes were dull,&#xD;
and the muscles of his once smooth, marble-like&#xD;
face were now flaccid, and covered with a growing&#xD;
unkempt beard.. Slovenliness had replaced tidi-&#xD;
ness, and every part and action of the man de.&#xD;
noted a great change in his physical and mental&#xD;
condition.&#xD;
Dr. Wattletop was perplexed. He questioned&#xD;
Mrs. Applegate and Edna, but could elicit nothing&#xD;
to assist him in finding a clue to the cause of this&#xD;
&#xD;
MARK GILDERSLEEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
233&#xD;
&#xD;
sudden and extraordinary transformation in an&#xD;
individual the least likely to be affected by care&#xD;
or illness. "A man of brazen constitution-.&#xD;
heart idem--brain idem," cogitated the doctor,&#xD;
"on whom emotions and troubles would gnaw&#xD;
in vain, who was apparently not deeply moved&#xD;
by the loss of his son, now shows unmistakable&#xD;
signs of mental distress--for mental it is."&#xD;
Basil Wattletop, M.D., albeit an experienced&#xD;
leech, was nonplussed, and muttering something&#xD;
to the ladies about "splenetic affection," "torpid&#xD;
liver," and the like, took his leave, to await fur-&#xD;
ther developments.&#xD;
A few days later the doctor was surprised to&#xD;
receive a message from Mr. Heath, asking him to&#xD;
call at his earliest convenience, on business not&#xD;
of a professional character,&#xD;
The doctor took the first opportunity to comply&#xD;
with the request, and on arriving at the Cliff was&#xD;
shown into the library, where Mr. Heath received&#xD;
his visitor, and motioned him to a chair, with&#xD;
something of his old courtliness of manner. The&#xD;
physician noticed that his host exhibited an im-&#xD;
proved appearance, and in particular that his&#xD;
toilet had been carefully attended to.&#xD;

"When I wrote you that note, doctor," said Mr.&#xD;
Heath with a weak smile, "I did not expect so&#xD;
soon to have the pleasure of a visit from you. I&#xD;
believe I was careful to state that what I wanted&#xD;
to see you about was not of a professional nat-&#xD;
ure."&#xD;
"Precisely," said the doctor, nodding his head&#xD;
in acquiescence,&#xD;
" Hence I trust it has not interfered with any&#xD;
of your engagements?"&#xD;
"Not at all," replied the doctor.&#xD;
It seemed as if Mr. Heath were reluctant to ap-&#xD;
proach the object for which he had summoned&#xD;
Dr. Wattletop, for he remained a few moments&#xD;
in silence with his fingers to his forehead in&#xD;
meditation, while the other watched him curi-&#xD;
ously. At length he abruptly said, "You are a&#xD;
freethinker, I am told, doctor ?"&#xD;
The physician, somewhat taken aback by this&#xD;
unexpected question, replied : "Well, it depends&#xD;
altogether upon your definition of the term. hf&#xD;
you mean by freethinker, one who exercises his&#xD;
reason in an independent way, I certainly am."&#xD;
a Do you, for instance, doctor, believe in eter-&#xD;
nal punishment?$ "&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, certainly not," said the doctor, very de-&#xD;
cidedly.&#xD;
"It's a fearful thought," ejaculated rather than&#xD;
spoke Mr. Heath, as a shudder seemed to pass&#xD;
over his frame.&#xD;
"Fearful? It's wicked, abominable, impious.&#xD;
To suppose that a beneficent God would condemn&#xD;
a weak mortal to a doom cruel beyond concep-&#xD;
tion, would punish in a way that eve4 imperfect&#xD;
man would not, under any provocation, is simply&#xD;
monstrous. Fortunately there are but few who&#xD;
really believe in such a doctrine, and those who&#xD;
do, are, I find, perfectly satisfied that they will&#xD;
escape, even if the rest of the world is sent to&#xD;
perdition."&#xD;
"Doctor," said Mr. Heath, "you will be very&#xD;
much surprised when I tell you that although I&#xD;
have been a communicant of the Episcopal&#xD;
Church for twenty years, and have conformed&#xD;
strictly to its formias and observances, I have no&#xD;
settled religious belief."&#xD;
"Not a bit surprised, Mr. Heath, not a bit. In&#xD;
fact, I believe that fully three-quarters of the at-&#xD;
tendants at Church are in the same condition. In-&#xD;

&#xD;
the most solemn and important truths are received,&#xD;
the mechanical piety of so-called devotees, and&#xD;
the facility with which they are swayed by trivial&#xD;
weaknesses, foibles, and vanities, I believe I am&#xD;
understating the proportion of practical unbe-&#xD;
lievers to the earnest and consistent professors.&#xD;
I have found this as my experience of men, that&#xD;
while all dread falling below what we may call&#xD;
the average of morality, the mass are indifferent&#xD;
about rising above it. In other words, while no&#xD;
one desires to be worse than his neighbor, no one&#xD;
cares about being any better. This accounts for&#xD;
the force of example, and the frequency of the&#xD;
tu-quoque sty1e of argument. It is true there are&#xD;
exceptions, earnest men and women full of en-&#xD;
thusiastic zeal, but if anything, these exceptions&#xD;
prove the rule."&#xD;
"Mr. Abbott explains this indifference and&#xD;
the present low state of morality to a want&#xD;
of spirituality in the Church," remarked Mr.&#xD;
Heath.&#xD;
"Want of fiddlesticks," replied the doctor.&#xD;
"Want of consistency is the trouble. Example-&#xD;

teacher. If you and I are inconsistent or unjust,&#xD;

"Permit me, doctor, to offer you some refresh-&#xD;

perhaps to change the topic of conversation, which&#xD;

Presently a domestic returned bearing a liqueur&#xD;
case.&#xD;
"cWill you please help yourself, doctor. Here&#xD;
is. some Sherry-or if you prefer it, Mononga-&#xD;
bela."&#xD;
While the doctor was dealing himself a liberal&#xD;
allowance of the whiskey, Mr. Heath resumed his&#xD;
seat and his meditative expression. Finally he&#xD;
drew himself closer to the doctor's chair, as if to&#xD;
beseech his attention, and said, "You and I, doc-&#xD;
tor, have arrived at that stage of existence when&#xD;
the illusions of youth have vanished-when all&#xD;
the feverish ambitions and vanities have lost their&#xD;
sway over us, and when we can look calmly at the&#xD;

This sense of disgust--of intense ennui of exist-&#xD;

coming ? Where can I get light as to the future?&#xD;
Where lean for assistance ? "&#xD;
This apostrophe was interjected, and as if call-&#xD;
ed forth by the speaker's sorrow.&#xD;
A pause, and he resumed:&#xD;
"Doctor, as one of my own age, and as a man&#xD;
in whose intellect, judgment, and heart I have&#xD;
the fullest confidence, I desire to make you my&#xD;
father-confessor. I crave sympathy and counsel.&#xD;
Perhaps I should apologize for burthening you&#xD;
with my trials and sorrows, but pity me-pity&#xD;
me !" He laid his hand on the physician's knee&#xD;
with such an appealing look, that the latter was&#xD;
touched. "Whom else can I consult with-&#xD;
whom turn to? I am at sea yawing like a rud-&#xD;
derless ship." -&#xD;
The doctor, who had been not a little surprised&#xD;
at the tenor of his host's conversation, expressed&#xD;
his condolence, and proffered his assistance in&#xD;
any way that it might be found serviceable. Mr.&#xD;
Heath looked for a moment as if he were about&#xD;
to confide something-then checked himself, and&#xD;

rising leaned on the mantle-piece in a. pensive&#xD;
attitude. Dr. Wattletop took this for an indica-&#xD;
tion that the conference was at an end, but the&#xD;
Monongahela being excellent, he lingered to re-&#xD;
fill his glass. Meanwhile Mr. Heath again sat&#xD;
down and addressed him:&#xD;
"You say, doctor, that you do not believe in&#xD;
eternal punishment, because, as I understand you,&#xD;
it is irreconcilable with reason."&#xD;
"Because it is irreconcilable with the attributes&#xD;
of the Almighty. - Again, where is the sense or&#xD;
harmony, or even necessity of it? I can under-&#xD;
stand' temporary punishment, but not everlasting&#xD;
punishment; that would resolve itself simply into&#xD;
revenge, a feeling that the Creator is incapable&#xD;
of harboring. No, sir, I believe there is a punish-&#xD;
ment for sin, but not an everlasting one. I be-&#xD;
lieve in the harmony of Nature, and that its laws&#xD;
are inexorable. They cannot be ,infringed with-&#xD;
out suffering. I do not believe in the forgiveness&#xD;
of sins."&#xD;
"Do not believe in the forgiveness of sins!&#xD;

keeps up to the average of respectability. Faith,&#xD;
Mr. Heath, as connected with dogmas and for-&#xD;
mulas, is of little consequence, in my estimation.&#xD;
Who do you think is the better man,-the one&#xD;
who believes in consubstantiation, or the one who&#xD;
believes in transubstantiation? My good mother,&#xD;
&#xD;
241&#xD;
&#xD;
who was a pious woman, brought me up in the&#xD;
tenets of the Established Church--hence youth-&#xD;
ful predilections and associations attach me to&#xD;
that fold. At one time the perusal of Paley's&#xD;
Natural Theology, the Bridgewater treatises, and&#xD;
works of that character, shook my faith, and left&#xD;
me a sceptic. Such works, although intended to&#xD;
strengthen faith, serve but to stimulate inquiry.&#xD;
Possessing an analytic mind, the subtle problems&#xD;
of Nature had a wonderful fascination for me,&#xD;
and in trying to solve them, I became for a&#xD;
time a proselyte to the unsatisfactory theories&#xD;
of materialistic philosophy, until, fortunately, I&#xD;
found in the teachings of Descartes a solid&#xD;
foundation for belief. No logic can success-&#xD;
fully assail the faith that springs from  intui-&#xD;
tion. Now, like Kant, I never cease to wonder&#xD;
at the starry heavens, but far more at the intui-&#xD;
tive knowledge of God and the Moral Law."&#xD;
"The moral Law," echoed Mr. Heath, ab-&#xD;
stractedly. After a few moments he returned,&#xD;
"Does not charity cover a multitude of sins?"&#xD;
"It's a convenient mantle, surely. As I said&#xD;
before, I do not believe sins are ever forgiven,&#xD;
but bring their own punishment inevitably.&#xD;

Here in this world they certainly do, for all&#xD;
sages agree on this: that happiness is only at-&#xD;
tamabl  throu h th   rctice -of  virtue, and  if&#xD;
this be so, the converse must necessarily be true,&#xD;
and those who do not practise it must be un-&#xD;
happy. As the physical health is governed by&#xD;
certain hygienic laws whose infraction inevitably&#xD;
produces disease, so is the spiritual health gov-&#xD;
erned by the moral law, whose infraction also as&#xD;
certainly brings suffering. To be good is to be&#xD;
spiritually healthy--wickedness is deformity or&#xD;
disease of the soul."&#xD;
" Then you 're not a believer in total deprav-&#xD;
ity?"&#xD;
"No. The thing that reconciles us to our-&#xD;
selves and our fellow-beings, is the knowledge&#xD;
that the evil we commit proceeds more from un-&#xD;
wisdom than from depravity. Man is far more&#xD;
of a fool than knave."&#xD;
" I mIust ask your indulgence, doctor, and par-&#xD;
don for the liberty I have taken in thus catechis-&#xD;
ing you; but as I said, I am emboldened to do&#xD;
so by the great esteem in which I hold you, and&#xD;
respect I entertain for your opinions and judg-&#xD;
ment. One more question: If this idea of 'duty,&#xD;
&#xD;
this Moral Law, as you term it, is from God, wh&#xD;
is it not the same in all men? A savage can sl&#xD;
treacherously and sleep peacefully afterwards&#xD;
Is not the moral law the creation of intellect?"&#xD;
"No, intellect merely unfolds and develops it.&#xD;
The sway of the moral law is in proportion to the&#xD;
quality of the soul and the degree of reason. Its&#xD;
power is diminished in beings of limited reason&#xD;
-or imperfect souls; hence, in a savage or a trg&#xD;
lodyte it is naturally less than in an enlightened&#xD;
man--and still less in a horse, with its deficient&#xD;
reason and incipient soul," explained the doctor,&#xD;
Mr. Heath again rose from    his seat, paced&#xD;
across the room, and for the first time \helped&#xD;
himself to a glass of spirits; then turning to t&#xD;
doctor, expressed, with forced lightness, his thanked&#xD;
for the instructive exposition he had been favored&#xD;
with. At this intimation the doctor took his de-&#xD;
parture, muttering to himself as he descended&#xD;
the staircase, "Very odd-T wonder what the&#xD;
deuce he wanted to see me for? Wished me'to&#xD;
be his father-confessor. - Egad! I think he as-&#xD;
sumed that role himself. If he had but asked me&#xD;
to feel his pulse or look at his tongue, I might&#xD;
have clapped a feedown against him. As it is,&#xD;

I have had all my trouble for nothing. That&#xD;
whiskey, though, was excellent-excellent.&#xD;
Edna had been waiting below to see the doctor,&#xD;
and as he was about opening thestreet-doorto&#xD;
leave, she approached with a look of concern:&#xD;
"Don't you think, doctor, that father is better-&#xD;
don't you see an improvement in him ."&#xD;
"Yes," replied Dr. Wattletop, cautiously, as&#xD;
he drew on his gloves; "Yes-I think, I-he&#xD;

" Oh thank you, doctor; I'm evero so muc&#xD;

"Still, it will be just as well,in case you notice&#xD;
any change in him or new peculiarity, to advise&#xD;
me cf it. Good-by."&#xD;

M. ITEAr   again sent for Dr. Wattletop.&#xD;

an institution had long made itself felt, and Mr.&#xD;
Heath had determined to build one and endow it&#xD;
liberally. Dr. Wattletop approved of the project&#xD;
and proffered his advice and assistance. Besides&#xD;
the hospital, Mr. Heath announced his purpose to&#xD;
erect, also at his sole expense, a home for orphan&#xD;
and friendless children.&#xD;
The doctor listened patiently, and acquiesced&#xD;
as Mr. Heath communicated his ideas, until turn-&#xD;
Ing abruptly from the discussion of the plan, he&#xD;
said, "Does it not strike you as a sad commentary&#xD;
on the condition of society, that such institutions&#xD;
should be made necessary?"&#xD;
"'low so?" inquired Mr. Heath.&#xD;
"Of course I am aware of what will be said&#xD;

"You surprise me, doctor," interrupted Mr.&#xD;
Heath, testily ; "from your qualities of head and&#xD;
heart I expected different counsel, and encourage.&#xD;

a"My qualities of head and heart," said the&#xD;
doctor, "have only taught ne this: that there is&#xD;

called virtues are but pinchbeck ones. From&#xD;
man's neglect and aversion to its practice spring&#xD;

pulses -in my judgment it is all valueless as an&#xD;
exemplar, or educator, in comparison with the&#xD;
performance of a simple act of justice."&#xD;
Mr. Heath seemed to be very much displeased&#xD;
at the doctor's frank exposition of his opinions,&#xD;
and said, as he gathered up his papers, "I am&#xD;
afraid, Dr. Wattletop, that you and I diverge too&#xD;
widely in our ideas on the subject we have been&#xD;
discussing, and as concord is indispensable in car-&#xD;
rying out successfully the objects I have in view,&#xD;
I think, upon the whole, I shall not be able to&#xD;
avail myself of your valuable services."&#xD;
As you please,-Mr. Heath, as you please, sir,"&#xD;
replied the doctor, rising and taking his leave; not,&#xD;
however, without a certain disappointment, as the&#xD;
recollection of the choice Monongahela he had&#xD;
tasted on the previous visit floated to his palate.&#xD;
"That man," soliloquized the doctor,,on his:&#xD;
way home, as he reflected on his interview with&#xD;
Mr. Heath, "that man has something on his&#xD;
mind. Soul-sickness of some kinda What crime&#xD;
must he have committed, to force him to atone&#xD;
by such prodigal dispensations?  What is the&#xD;

&#xD;
medicine for his cure, I wonder? Shall -it be&#xD;
Sublapsarianism or Supralapsariaism, or an elec-&#xD;
tuary compounded of Podobaptism and Sabel-&#xD;
lianism ? Methinks yon stalwart son of Holy&#xD;
Mother Church, Father Maguire, would be most&#xD;
successful in this case. The heroic surgery of&#xD;
the disciples of Loyola is often efficacious in such&#xD;
maladies. Strange that that honest, consistent,&#xD;
unselfish, truest soldier of the Cross should be&#xD;
the automaton of an order whose cardinal doc-&#xD;
trine is 'passive obedience,' whose aim is to de-&#xD;
stroy free thought and enlightenment, and remand&#xD;
the world to the middle ages," ,&#xD;
These latter reflections of the doctor were&#xD;
drawn forth by the appearance of the parish&#xD;
priest, who was passing by at the time. His&#xD;
reverence was a good-humored, blue-eyed Celt,&#xD;
with whom the doctor had occasional polemical&#xD;
encounters, and sorely tried with his latitudina-&#xD;
rianism.&#xD;
Mr. heath next convoked the clergymen of the&#xD;
various denominations in Belton, and invited&#xD;
- their co-operation in carrying out his philanthrop-&#xD;
ic projects. They readily acceded to his wishes,&#xD;

and expressed their entire concurrence in his&#xD;
plans. Of course these Praisewonrty acts of Mr.&#xD;
Heath met with generalpcommendation, and as&#xD;
they involved the expenditure of very large sums&#xD;
of money, elicited many enconams on his munif-&#xD;
icence and beneficence. In fact, he was giving&#xD;
evidence in every way of what the wyv. Mr.&#xD;
Sniffen called a " change of heart."  There was&#xD;
an unmistakable earnestness now in his attend-&#xD;
ance at worship, and a lowering of his crest that&#xD;
denoted an attempt to walk in the paths of hu-&#xD;
mility. There was also a perceptible ameliora&#xD;
tion in his health, arising probably from the di-&#xD;
version of thought called forth by his benevolent&#xD;
schemes., Edna noticed these gratifying changes&#xD;
in her father's physical condition with joy, and&#xD;
he seemed to appreciate her filial attention and&#xD;
solicitude by increased affection for her. Iais&#xD;
sole pleasure now was in her society,eand as&#xD;
warmer days caine he enjoyed long drives in&#xD;
company with her. Edna had a pair of feet&#xD;
ponies which she drove like an experienced whip,&#xD;
and her basket-phaeton was often seen on golden&#xD;
afternoons scouring along the banks of the beau-&#xD;
tiful Passaic, or through the wooded hillseof&#xD;

Pompton, with her father languidly reclining be-&#xD;
side her, and a dapper groom in the rumble.&#xD;
One evening, as they were returning home&#xD;
from a drive, and were within a few rods of&#xD;
the gateway, a man who had been lying on the&#xD;
sward by the road-side staggered to his feet, and&#xD;
motioned as ifhe wished to speak to them. lIe&#xD;
was a rough fellow, a tramp, and evidently in-&#xD;
toxicated.  Edna, somewhat alarmed, would&#xD;
havp whipped up the ponies, but the man stood&#xD;
in front of them gesticulating, and for fear of&#xD;
hurting him, she drew in the reins and stopped.&#xD;
The groom, leaping from his seat, wasabout&#xD;
deal harshly with the interloper, when at a sign.&#xD;
from his master he desisted. The fellow, with an&#xD;
unsteady gait, approached Mr. Heath, and held&#xD;
out his hand, saying: "I told 'em, old man, I&#xD;
told 'em wanted to see you. That chap at the&#xD;
gate over ere wouldn't let me in. Told 'm&#xD;
you was my friend-best friend ever had in the&#xD;
world-ain't that so, old man ? How you been,.&#xD;
old top-all right, eh .?"&#xD;
The under-gardener, who acted as lodge-keePer,&#xD;
here advanced, and explained that the man had&#xD;
made several attempts to force himself in the&#xD;
&#xD;
251&#xD;
&#xD;
grounds, saying that he was acquainted with Mr.&#xD;
Heath, and wished to see him on business.&#xD;
"Sho I did-sho I did-'portant business, I&#xD;
said, 'portant business, old man," repeated the&#xD;
fellow,&#xD;
At the apparition of this stranger, Mr. Heath's&#xD;
features became livid-iis fingers grasped the&#xD;
side of the phaeton nervously, and for a moment&#xD;
he seemed unable to utter a word, Edna fortu-&#xD;
nately was too much occupied in watching the&#xD;
intruder and cause of all the trouble, to heed her&#xD;
father's agitation, while he with a strong effort&#xD;
collected himself.&#xD;
" Wouldn't b'lieve ne-told 'ermyou was my&#xD;
friend-best friend, eh, old man ?  That's so,&#xD;
thats so, repeated the man with drunken per-&#xD;
sistency, while Mr. Heath alighting, bade Edna&#xD;
rather peremptorily to drive oi, and with a hasty&#xD;
gesture waved the gardener away.&#xD;
The stranger was a red-bearded man of powerful&#xD;
build, within about ten years of Mr. Heath's age.&#xD;
his aspect was coarse and vulgar, and his gar-&#xD;
ments worn and filthy. Judging from the tattooing&#xD;
on the backs of his hands, and his red, rugose&#xD;
neck, he was probably a seafarer, Mr. Heath&#xD;

house and into the library, where they remained&#xD;
closeted together all the evening. Meals were&#xD;
brought up to them, and the household saw no&#xD;
more of the man, for he apparently disappeared&#xD;
before the next morning.&#xD;
Although Edna was not a little surprised at&#xD;
this occurrence, and at her father's bearing to-&#xD;
wards the stranger, she made no allusion to him,&#xD;
and Mr. Heath anticipated any remarks from his&#xD;
sister by saying that the man was an unfortu-&#xD;
nate being with a family dependent upon him&#xD;
for support, whom he had several times as-&#xD;
sisted, and who presumed to return. "I.doubt&#xD;
whether it is really a charity to help such peo-&#xD;
ple," added Mr Heath, with affected carelessness.&#xD;
"Still one cannot resist these appeals, especially&#xD;
when an innocent family of small children is&#xD;
likely to suffer, for a slave to drink seldom re-&#xD;
forms."&#xD;
"Has he a large family ?" asked Mrs. Apple-&#xD;

"Yes, yes, I believe so," replied fr. Heath,&#xD;

This closed the conversation on that subject,&#xD;
but Mr. Heath's weak nerves were so shaken by&#xD;
the incident, that for several days after he re-&#xD;
mained at home, and refused any longer to ac-&#xD;
company his daughter in her walks or rides.  A.&#xD;
fortnight or so later, Mrs. Applegate, who was&#xD;
reading the newspaper, incidentally remarked:&#xD;
."I see that they have caught that Petersn&#xD;
the pirate."&#xD;
Mr. Heath, who was reclining in an easy-chair,&#xD;
started as if a bolt had struck him  "What!&#xD;
Who?" he exclaimed.&#xD;
"Dear me, Rufus, how you startled me! I&#xD;
merely said that that dreadful murderer that they&#xD;
called Peterson, the pirate, and who escaped&#xD;
from jail, has been caught. You must remember&#xD;
the time there was about it. It was a little after&#xD;
John's death. I remember there was a story go-&#xD;
ing around that his name was not Peterson, but&#xD;
Love, and that he formerly lived in Belton,&#xD;
Old Mrs. Cosgrove told me then that she remem-&#xD;
bered him very well, and that his mother was a&#xD;
washerwoman. She said, too, that he was a thief&#xD;
when a boy; and ran away to sea after robbing&#xD;
his master."&#xD;

"IMrs. Cosgrove is a silly gossip, Susan," said&#xD;
Mr. Heath, impatiently. "The boy was not a&#xD;
thief."&#xD;
"Indeed-why, Rufus, I heard from--"&#xD;
"Never mind ; it's of no consequence, and we&#xD;
will not argue the matter," interrupted Mr.&#xD;
Heath. "Let me look at the paper a moment."&#xD;
In order to render this colloquy more intelli-&#xD;
gible, it will be necessary to state that about eight&#xD;
or nine months previously the public mind was&#xD;
intensely agitated and shocked by the details of a&#xD;
murder of a very atrocious character. The crinne&#xD;
had been committed by a sailor who had shipped&#xD;
for a short voyage on a small coaster. When at&#xD;
sea he had'slain the captain, mate, and cook, and&#xD;
then running the craft near shore, had scuttled&#xD;
her, leaving in the yawl with a small sum of&#xD;
money belonging to the captain, to obtain which&#xD;
had been the sole motive of the triple murder.&#xD;
Landing on the sea-coast .a few miles below&#xD;
Sandy Hook, the murderer had been captured by&#xD;
some fishermen, whp had watched his suspicious&#xD;
movements. The smack, instead of sinking, was&#xD;
found adrift,-witli the proofs of the horrid deed&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
still fresh and visible, The guilt seemed, there-&#xD;
fore, plainly fixed on the accused, and there was&#xD;
but little doubt that the trial would result in his&#xD;
conviction. Still the evidence against him was&#xD;
but circumstantial, and his counsel, a man of&#xD;
ability, made strenuous and persistent efforts to&#xD;
clear him. In the progress of the case, it came&#xD;
out that the prisoner was an old and hardened&#xD;
desperado, who had been incarcerated many times&#xD;
in various countries for misdemeanors of every'&#xD;
degree. It was furthermore discovered that he&#xD;
had given to the court an assumed name, and&#xD;
that his true one was Klove, and native place&#xD;
Belton. This revelation, naturally enough, cre-&#xD;
ated some excitement among the older inhabitants&#xD;
of that town, who still remembered iKove as a&#xD;
boy of fourteen, who had been forced to leave the&#xD;
place in consequence of an accusation of theft.&#xD;
This charge, although not proven at the time,&#xD;
was now resurrected,, and brought up to his prej-&#xD;
udice as an illustration of how youthful depravity&#xD;
would lead eventually to the gravest and blackest&#xD;
crimes. Mr. Heath, who was a clerk at the time&#xD;
Klove was living in Belton, and had a distinct&#xD;
recollection -of him, was naturally much inter-&#xD;

ested in the progress of his trial, and read and&#xD;
re-read the reports of it as they appeared in the&#xD;
newspapers, with an absorbing interest. In sin-&#xD;
gular contrast was his dislike to having the sub-&#xD;
ject mentioned or talked about in his family.&#xD;
Mrs. Applegat, who had a predilection for the&#xD;
horrible, wa4 full of the murder, and discussed&#xD;
it at every n eal, much to her brother's annoy-&#xD;
ance. As the rial drew near its close, Mr. Heath&#xD;
took a short trip, being absent about a week.&#xD;
While he w s away, the trial, which was held at&#xD;
Freehold, ca e to an end; and, in spite of the&#xD;
skilful effort to exculpate him, the prisoner was&#xD;
convicted..  he case was too clear to admit of&#xD;
the slightest doubt, and the jury found him guilty&#xD;
of murder. His lawyer tried strenuously to ob-&#xD;
tain a new trial, but without avail, and he was&#xD;
remanded for sentence.&#xD;
The very ext night Klove broke jail-a bar&#xD;
of the window of his cell had been wrenched&#xD;
out, and watch-spring saws and files were found&#xD;
lying about, conveying the impression that he&#xD;
had received assistance. A  turnkey was sus-&#xD;
pected of complicity and dismissed, although the&#xD;
proof was hardly sufficient to implicate him. It&#xD;
&#xD;
was this escaped pirate-this murderer whose re-&#xD;
capture, after having eluded the officers of jus-&#xD;
tice for several months, when announced by Mrs.&#xD;
Applegate to her brother, produced such a shock&#xD;
to the latter's feelings. The fellow, it appeared,&#xD;
instead of fleeing to some distant land, had re-&#xD;
paired to his former low haunts in Nev York,&#xD;
and spent his time in idleness and carousing, for&#xD;
he was apparently well supplied with money.&#xD;
While in liquor and in an unguarded moment,&#xD;
he had betrayed himself by some compromising&#xD;
remark, which, coming to the knowledge of the&#xD;
police, caused him to be speedily secured, and on&#xD;
a requisition front the Governor of New Jersey,&#xD;
conveyed back to his quarters in the county jail&#xD;
at Freehold. He was now placed in double&#xD;
irons, and kept so strictly guarded day and night&#xD;
as to preclude the possibility of a second evasion.&#xD;
Soon after Klove's recapture, Mr. Heath again&#xD;
started on a mysterious journey. During his ab-&#xD;
sence the news came that strong efforts were be-&#xD;
ing made by some influential person to obtain a&#xD;
pardon for Move from the Governor. To ac-&#xD;

of so great a criminal, it was rumored and popu-&#xD;
larly believed that Klove was not love, but the&#xD;
losel son of a venerable bishop of the Episcopal&#xD;
Church, distinguished alike for piety and learning,&#xD;
who was naturally anxious to save his offspring&#xD;
from the disgraceful, though well-merited, deat&#xD;
of a felon. Nothing transpired, however, to sus-&#xD;
tain this report, which was simply a figment  o&#xD;
the imagination, due, doubtless, to the popular&#xD;
love for the marvellous. Meanwhile love had&#xD;
been sentenced to death, and lay in prison await-&#xD;
ing  his doom.&#xD;
A fortnight or so elapsed before Mr.wlieath&#xD;
returned. Edna saw at a glance that there was&#xD;
a change for the worse in her father's condition.&#xD;
He was evidently laboring under a recurrencetod&#xD;
one of his melancholic spells, with aggravateun-&#xD;
symptoms. His form had waste dt he plainly&#xD;
tenance become haggard.   n sh.r,       at&#xD;
exhibited the signs of one borne down by a great&#xD;
weight of grief. To his daughter's affectionate&#xD;
inquiries, he replied only in monosyllables, and&#xD;
repaired immediately to his apartment. Edna&#xD;
consulted with her aunt, and Dr. Wattletop was&#xD;
again summoned; but Mr. Heath peremptor Y&#xD;
&#xD;
MARK GILDERsLEEVE-        259&#xD;
&#xD;
refused to see him or any other physician, and&#xD;
the two ladies were left a prey to their apprehen-&#xD;
sions.&#xD;
Mr. Heath's condition excited the doctor's pro-&#xD;
fessional curiosity. It was an abtruse physiolog-&#xD;
ical problem, and spurred his zeal. By dint of&#xD;
patient investigation, and consultation with the&#xD;
family, he discovered the great interest Mr.&#xD;
Heath took in the pirate Klove. lie questioned&#xD;
the groom and gardener in relation to the stran-&#xD;
ger who had been harbored by Mr. heath, and by&#xD;
comparing their descriptions with others, came to&#xD;
the conclusion that the mysterious visitor and&#xD;
Klove were one and the same man. To satisfy&#xD;
himself clearly on that point and obtain a further&#xD;
clue to this singular affair, he proceeded to Free-&#xD;
hold. Here he was not only confirmed in his&#xD;
conclusions, but learned, furthermore, that a gen-&#xD;
tleman, a stranger, answering closely to a descrip-&#xD;
tion of Mr. Heath, had been noticed in attendance&#xD;
at the trial, and in frequent consultation with the&#xD;
prisoner's lawyer.&#xD;
There was no longer any doubt in the doctor's&#xD;
mind of the existence of some connection or in-&#xD;
timacy between the pirate and the patrician,&#xD;

which the mere fact of the former's having once&#xD;
lived in Belton would scarcely account for.&#xD;
ie was inclined to suspect a secret tie of kinship,&#xD;
had it not been clearly established- at the trial&#xD;
that Klove was born in Germany, and brought to&#xD;
the United States in childhood by his parents.&#xD;
Still cudgelling his brains for a plausible theory&#xD;
to account for Mr. heath's singular proceedings,&#xD;
he was' at length forced to refer them to some&#xD;
phase of hypochondria.&#xD;
Mrs. Applegate was decidedly of the opinion,&#xD;
now, that her brother was going out of his mid.&#xD;
She had often heard of such cases, she informed&#xD;
Dr. Wattletop. Mr. Applegate had a friend who&#xD;
was taken so, though, to be sure, his trouble arose&#xD;
from the Millerite excitement, and fear of the&#xD;
world's coming to an end. "Of course Rufus&#xD;
has no dread of that kind or anything of the sort,&#xD;
but I do think and believe that it all grows out of&#xD;
his son's death, and nothing else."&#xD;
" Do you really think that. he is so much&#xD;
affected by his son's death?" asked the doctor,&#xD;
with an incredulous expression.&#xD;
" I don't think he has been the same man since.&#xD;
To be sure he didn't take on so much at first, and&#xD;
&#xD;
didn't seem to realize it fully; but T believe he&#xD;
feels it more and more, and it is that that has&#xD;
made him so different from what he used to be.&#xD;
Poor Edna! dear me, she worries so about her&#xD;
father, and I'm very much afraid she'll fall sick&#xD;
if this continues. Her room is near his, and she&#xD;
says she hears him pacing the floor at all hours of&#xD;
the night."&#xD;
"Insomnia, eh?"&#xD;
.And he talks to himself so often; and then&#xD;
again, if you speak to him, or question him, he&#xD;
looks at you so vacantly without replying."&#xD;
Precursory sign of cerebral disease, thought&#xD;
the doctor.&#xD;
"It's dreadful-dreadful ! " continued Mrs.&#xD;
Applegate. "I can't help but think sometimes&#xD;
that Rufus is losing his senses, and yet such a&#xD;
thing as insanity was never known in our family."&#xD;
Dr. Wattletop had arrived at a somewhat sim-&#xD;
ilar conclusion. He believed Mr. Heath's dis-&#xD;
ease was taking the form of monomania, brought&#xD;
about by the combined effects of disappointment&#xD;
and grief on an overwrought brain. In such a&#xD;
condition the distracted mind was not only read-&#xD;

"It is very important in Mr. Heath's present&#xD;
state, Mrs. Applegate, that we should keep his&#xD;
mind as free as possible from any agitation. No&#xD;
exciting news should reach him. If it were possi-&#xD;
ble to keep the newspapers from him, it would be&#xD;
well; but I presume that is out of the question.&#xD;
However, be careful and vigilant. I think he&#xD;
needs rest and tranquillity more than anything&#xD;
else now. If he would only consent to see me, and&#xD;
if I could only interrogate him a little, I might&#xD;
form a more intelligent opinion of his condition.&#xD;
At the last interview I had with him, we had an&#xD;
interchange of opinions on subjects connected&#xD;
with certain plans of his, and I don't think he&#xD;
was pleased with my comments on them; so I&#xD;
don't know how far my attendance on him would&#xD;
be acceptable now."&#xD;
" He won't hear of any physician's being spoken&#xD;
to about him. I have tried my utmost, and Edna&#xD;
has pleaded; but he's as obstinate as can be, and&#xD;
won't listen to us," said Mrs. Applegate.-&#xD;
"Sorry. As it is, I am to a certain extent&#xD;
groping in the dark, and under the circumstances,&#xD;
&#xD;
as you can readily understand, it is very difficult&#xD;
to prescribe a course of treatment with any de-&#xD;
gree of confidence. I don't know what else I&#xD;
can say or recommend just now. As I said, pre-&#xD;
vent as far as possible any vexations, exciting, or&#xD;
annoying news from reaching him. Note every&#xD;
symptom, and advise me."&#xD;
Such commonplace ad vice was - doubtless all&#xD;
that the physician could, offer, as Mr. Heath&#xD;
stubbornly refused to see him or any other medi-&#xD;
cal man, and indeed, had given himself up to&#xD;
such complete isolation, as to deny audience even&#xD;
to his business agent, and to the architect in&#xD;
charge of the construction of the Hospital and&#xD;
the Home, so that the building of those institu-&#xD;
tions was now perforce suspended. He even be-&#xD;
gan to evince an aversion to the society of his&#xD;
family, and to avoid meeting them, took his&#xD;
meals by himself in his own apartments.&#xD;

Omr Friday Klove was hanged.&#xD;
The public prints of the following day- were&#xD;
filled with details of the occurrence, and Mrs.&#xD;
Applegate, mindful of the doctor's injunctions,&#xD;
strove to keep her brother from reading them.&#xD;
A futile effort, though, for Mr. Heath, on find-&#xD;
ing that the newspapers were not brought to him&#xD;
at the usual time, rang the bell violently, and&#xD;
rated the servant soundly for the omission.&#xD;
The magnifico was in his chamber, and looked&#xD;
as aged as a man of eighty. His hair and beard&#xD;
had turned white, his eyes were cavernous and&#xD;
feverishly bright. Roused momentarily by the&#xD;
incident just mentioned, he returned to his seat&#xD;
in an arm-chair near the fire, where, wrapped in&#xD;
a dressing-gown, he had probably passed te&#xD;
night, as his couch was undisturbed. He soon&#xD;
relapsed into a gloomy meditation, holding in his&#xD;
hands the folded newspaper, which he appar-&#xD;
ently hesitated and dreaded to read. Suddenly,&#xD;

with an effort, his fingers spread the sheet open,&#xD;
and he scanned the columns rapidly until his&#xD;
eyes rested on the account of Klove's execution.&#xD;
To an unusually long description of the horrible&#xD;
affair' was appended what purported to be the&#xD;
confession of the malefactor, made to the clergy-&#xD;
man in attendance, and reported verbatim. It&#xD;
ran thus:&#xD;
CONFESSION OF LOVE, THE PIRATE.&#xD;
When I was a boy I lived in Belton, in this&#xD;
State. My mother was a widow, for my father&#xD;
died the year after we came to this country from&#xD;
Germany. There were two of us children, me&#xD;
and a girl. My mother did washing for a liv-&#xD;
ing, and I worked for a man named Cook, who&#xD;
was very hard to get along with, and to him I lay&#xD;
all my troubles. I suppose I must forgive every-&#xD;
body now, as I hope to be forgiven myself, but&#xD;
it's mighty hard to let up on him. Now I ain't&#xD;
a -going to say that I didn't kill the men aboard&#xD;
the smack, and that I am unjustly sentenced to&#xD;
die; but I say this, and I believe, as I hope for&#xD;
mercy hereafter, that if it hadn't been for the&#xD;
unjust way in which I was treated when I was a&#xD;

boy, by that man, I wouldn't be here now. The&#xD;
way of it all was this: One day Cook sent me&#xD;
with some money to pay a bill at the store. I&#xD;
didn't know how mach there was, but when the&#xD;
store-keeper counted it he said, it ran short ten&#xD;
dollars. When I went back to Cook and told&#xD;
him, he got angry, and said he had given me the&#xD;
right sum, and I must have stolen the difference.&#xD;
Now he had a grudge against me, and I believe&#xD;
he never gave me the money, but wanted to get&#xD;
me into trouble. I knew I couldn't have lost it,&#xD;
and the shop-keeper counted it before my eyes,&#xD;
and he couldn't have taken it. Ilowsomever,&#xD;
Cook swore I stole the money, and they locked&#xD;
me up. They didn't keep me long, though, for&#xD;
they couldn't bring any proof, and was obliged to&#xD;
let me off. But I couldn't stay in Belton after&#xD;
that, for no one would employ me, and they all&#xD;
shunned me for a thief. So I left the place and&#xD;
went to New York, but as I was a stranger there,&#xD;
and didn't know any one, I couldn't find work.&#xD;
Then I shipped for a three years' ci-uise, for I&#xD;
thought by that time all would be forgot, and I&#xD;
could go back home. As bad luck would have it,&#xD;
my shipmates found out that I had been locked&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
up for thieving, and when one of the crew had&#xD;
his chest broken open, and some things missing,&#xD;
they laid it to me. I was innocent, but they&#xD;
wouldn't believe it, and the character I had got&#xD;
went against me, and I wasn't spared a bit. The&#xD;
captain abused me, the mate rope's-ended me, and&#xD;
the men kicked me and called me jail-bird, until&#xD;
I was more miserable than a dog. My whole feel&#xD;
ings were changed. I got bitter and revengeful,&#xD;
and if it hadn't been that I couldn't get away I&#xD;
would have knived some of my shipmates. When&#xD;
the vessel touched at the Sandwich Islands, I ran&#xD;
away and knocked about with the beach-combers,&#xD;
a wicked set of outcasts, until I became bad as any&#xD;
of them. I lived among the Islands several years.&#xD;
I shipped again, ran down to Valparaiso, and&#xD;
made several voyages up and down the coast.&#xD;
One day I got into a drunken row in a pulqueria,&#xD;
and stabbed a Chilian. This caused me to be&#xD;
sent to work in the mines as a convict. I got&#xD;
away from there after staying three years and&#xD;
shipped in'a French ship to Bordeaux, and from&#xD;
there I got to New York. I hadn't been in the&#xD;
States for ten years, and all that time I hadn't&#xD;
heard anything from my folks. I had become so&#xD;

reckless as to have no wish to see any of them.&#xD;
When in New York I went one night to a dance-&#xD;
house in Cherry Street, and there among the&#xD;
women I found my sister. We didn't know each&#xD;
other at first, but I discovered her by a queer&#xD;
scar on her neck, which she got from a buirn&#xD;
when a child. After questioning her, I found&#xD;
out that my mother took on so about me that she&#xD;
left Belton soon after I did, and went to New&#xD;
York. There she fell sick, and died in want, and&#xD;
there was my sister a degraded creature. What&#xD;
little good was left in me was turned by this&#xD;
sight into bad, and I swore to be even with a&#xD;
world that had been so unjust to me and mine.&#xD;
The old feeling of vengeance rose up in my&#xD;
breast-the devil got hold of me, and I thought&#xD;
of Cook. That 'night I started off to find him,&#xD;
and went to Belton. I hung around there till I&#xD;
found out he was dead and gone some years. If&#xD;
he had been living I would have killed him, sure.&#xD;
All that's wrong, I know, but I couldn't help it.&#xD;
Then I felt just like waging war on all the world.&#xD;
I went to California, and kept a drinking shop on&#xD;
what they called the Barbary coast, where I used&#xD;
to rob miners. Finally I shot one that showed&#xD;
&#xD;
269&#xD;
&#xD;
fight, and the Vigilance Committee drove me off,&#xD;
and 1 cane back to the States aid went to New&#xD;
Orleans, staid awhile, and came north. I knocked&#xD;
around New York for a time, and finally shipped&#xD;
on the smack, where I committed the deed that's&#xD;
brought me here. The world has got the best of&#xD;
me at last, and it was very wrong and sinful for&#xD;
me to kill the men, and it is right that I should&#xD;
suffer for it and be hung; I ain't a-going to deny&#xD;
that; but I know this and repeat it, that if I had&#xD;
been treated right when a boy, if I hadn't been&#xD;
accused of stealing when I was innocent, I&#xD;
,wouldn't be here now, and my sister wouldn't&#xD;
have been ruined. We might have been as&#xD;
happy and as good as any, so let Almighty God&#xD;
judge. Before I go I want to say this: that in&#xD;
the trial I was fairly treated, and I want to pub-&#xD;
licly thank all those people who were so kind to&#xD;
me. One gentleman has been veiy good to me,&#xD;
did all he could to help me, and I can't be too&#xD;
grateful to him. lHe happened just to have re-&#xD;
nembered me when I was a boy and lived in&#xD;
Belton, and to this kind and benevolent man, I&#xD;
say, may God bless him and reward him."&#xD;

Rufus Heath read those lines with dilated eyes&#xD;
and shortened breath, like one undergoing the&#xD;
rack. When he had finished, he let the paper&#xD;
drop and uttered a deep groan. His head sank&#xD;
back on his chair, arid he pressed his hands over&#xD;
his temples and brow as if to smother distract-&#xD;
ing thoughts. lie remained thus for some time,&#xD;
until a light hand was placed on his shoulder,&#xD;
when he started as if it had been a blow.&#xD;
The intruder was Edna, who, having knocked&#xD;
at the door and receiving no reply, had entered&#xD;
the room with some anxiety. "Father, dear fa-&#xD;
ther, how you frighten me ! What ails you?&#xD;
Are you in pain?" exclaimed she, alarmed at his&#xD;
wild aspect. " Do tell me, please tell me, what is&#xD;
the matter?"&#xD;
"Matter-matter," repeated Mr. Heath abstract-&#xD;
edly, as he rose and walked towards the window.&#xD;
"No-no-nothing, child, nothing. Why do you&#xD;
-Ring the bell for James and leave me-leave&#xD;
me, I tell you. I have business to occupy me."&#xD;
He was rattling his fingers nervously on the&#xD;
window-panes as he spoke, and looking vacantly&#xD;
out. His daughter strove to draw him aside, and&#xD;
looking in his face asked anxiously if she might&#xD;
&#xD;

be permitted to send for a physician. "I'm sure&#xD;
there's something the matter with you-you look&#xD;
so very, very strange. Do please, father, may&#xD;
I?"&#xD;
"No, no, no! Leave me, Edna, and do as I&#xD;
bid you."  She obeyed, and Mr. Heath made a&#xD;
struggle to regain his self-possession. When the&#xD;
servant came, he directed him to bring a decan-&#xD;
ter of brandy. As soon as it was brought, with&#xD;
a trembling hand he poured out a tumblerful&#xD;
and gulped it down. It seemed to affect him no&#xD;
more than so mich water, and pacing the room,&#xD;
he forced a laugh as he soliloquized: "Idiot,&#xD;
idiot, and threefold fool! What is it to me that&#xD;
this vagabond and ruffian has met his deserts ?&#xD;
Nothing, surely nothing. Then why should I&#xD;
worry about it? Why should' I be tormented.&#xD;
and maddened by it? Those who murder must&#xD;
expect to be hung. A man is responsible only&#xD;
for his own crimes-the crimes he himself com-&#xD;

stained desperado he was, and what a life he had&#xD;
led! Where was bis soul now? Who would ex-&#xD;
change places with him to gain the whole world?&#xD;
And all this had arisen, he said, from the dis-&#xD;
honesty of some one who. had caused him to be&#xD;
unjustly accused of stealing a small sum of&#xD;
&#xD;
money. What a flimsy and shameless apology!&#xD;
What an atrocious attempt to shift the responsi-&#xD;
bility of hellish deeds to other shoulders; to drag&#xD;
some innocent person to everlasting perdition&#xD;
with him!   Suppose Cook, his employer, had&#xD;
really given him the money, and had no intention&#xD;
of wrongfully accusing him-what then? Per-&#xD;
haps the money vas lost, and if so, if any one&#xD;
had found it they would naturally have kept it.&#xD;
Of course, anybody would do that. It's a very&#xD;
common thing for persons to do. It is an every-&#xD;
day occurrence. No one but a fool would act&#xD;
otherwise. Ten dollars is but a trifle, and to at-&#xD;
tribute to the loss of a sum so paltry such ter-&#xD;
rible, awful consequences, is simply ridiculous.&#xD;
But the boy should not have been allowed to rest&#xD;
under the imputation of having stolen it. He&#xD;
should have been saved from arrest. They dis-&#xD;
charged him-yes, they discharged him. He&#xD;
was not long imprisoned. True, but he should&#xD;
have been cleared from suspicion at any cost-&#xD;
any cost ! His innocence proclaimed in thunder&#xD;
tones far and wide! To omit that was wrong,&#xD;
fearfully, bitterly wrong ! Not doing so, forced&#xD;
him to leave home in disgrace; made hin an&#xD;

outcast, killed his mother, drove his sister to&#xD;
shame. Horror! . . .. .      -&#xD;
..And he thanked the kind gentle&#xD;
man who had been so good to him, and with his&#xD;
dying breath, bade God bless and reward him!&#xD;
"O Christ, help-help me!"&#xD;
These last words escaped from Mr. Heath in a&#xD;
lacerating cry. He pressed his hands to his face&#xD;
as if to shut out some horrifying sight, and re-&#xD;
mained so until he gradually fell into a dreamy&#xD;
stupor. The excited mind ceased to work, and&#xD;
became numb. Luminous images floated before&#xD;
his mental vision, and kaleidoscopic, intermin-&#xD;
glings of uncouth objects and faces.&#xD;
Then the wearied and distracted brain lapsed&#xD;
into a feverish slumber-a slumber alive with&#xD;
fearful visions. He dreamt he was in a prison-&#xD;
cell. It was' night, and the grated door swung&#xD;
open to admit the jailer and hangman. They&#xD;
pinioned him, and led him out to the scaffold.&#xD;
At the foot of the gallows lay a coffin, containing'&#xD;
the corpse of Klove, with horribly distorted feat-&#xD;
ures. The hangman was about pulling a cap over&#xD;
his face, when Mr. Heath awoke with trembling&#xD;
limbs, and a cold sweat starting from every pore.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was evening, for he had lain in that stupor&#xD;
and sleep for hours. Again he resorted to the&#xD;
brandy to dissipate the lingering impressions&#xD;
of the frightful nightmare, and then rang the&#xD;
bell. The servant appeared, and desired to.know&#xD;
what his master wanted.    Nothing-nothing,&#xD;
Yes, to have light in the library-he would read.&#xD;
Did Mr. Heath wish to have dinner brought up&#xD;
to him? No, no; leave me-leave me. The man&#xD;
lit the gas in the library, replenished 'the grate,&#xD;
and left.&#xD;
The library was the room     adjoining Mr.&#xD;
Heath's, and thither he went. He took a volume&#xD;
from a shelf, and returned to his apartment; then&#xD;
resumed his seat and lethargic stare at the fire.&#xD;
The book fell unheeded from his grasp.&#xD;
Hours passed, and again the coarse, distorted,&#xD;
purple features of Klove appeared-once the&#xD;
countenance of a timid boy, who stood falsely&#xD;
accused and cowering before a stern magistrate&#xD;
thence driven by a storm of hisses, and flying&#xD;
from home, followed by a widowed mother and&#xD;
child-sister. And the brand THIEF clings to the&#xD;
hapless lad, and enmeshes him in a web of mis-&#xD;
fortune; now reckless with despair, he plunges&#xD;

&#xD;
into vice and crime, until the law forces him to&#xD;
yield up his spotted soul on the gallows!&#xD;
And how fared the real thief?.&#xD;
He, sly and sharp, in sudden glee at his trover,&#xD;
bought with it a lottery ticket that drew a prize.&#xD;
This windfall, shrewdly invested, brought him a&#xD;
fortune, then an heiress; and thus he waxed in&#xD;
wealth and station, until he became one whose&#xD;
possessions bred envy, and whose position com-&#xD;
manded respect; while the innocent and wrongly&#xD;
accused boy became an outcast, a criminal-an&#xD;
assassin!  Driven to perdition by the wealthy&#xD;
and respectable citizen!&#xD;
"It's a dream-a dream. The foolish dream&#xD;
of an enfeebled man, whose reason and judgment&#xD;
are failing and wandering; who is frightened at&#xD;
shadows conjured by his imagination. My mind&#xD;
wanders. Why will those dreadful thoughts re-&#xD;
turn? That sinking terror !"&#xD;
"I must leave this room-this place-for the&#xD;
air is full of jibing imps!  . . . . I must&#xD;
go, for all this luxury mocks me. Away from&#xD;
this roof-from these ponderous walls, that are&#xD;
&#xD;
loaded with iniquity, or they will fall and crush&#xD;
me. . . . . In some quiet, retired spot I&#xD;
may live in happiness and peace."  . .&#xD;
Mr. heath left his room, and with stealthy&#xD;
steps descended the stairs.  It was late; the&#xD;
house was silent; all had retired for the night&#xD;
save he. With nimble fingers he opened the&#xD;
hall-door noiselessly, and went out on the lawn.&#xD;
He was bareheaded, and in his dressing-gown&#xD;
and slippers. The night was dark, gloomy, and&#xD;
rainy. The cold drops falling on his unprotected&#xD;
head seemed to soothe and refresh him.&#xD;
"So, so-this is better," he exclaimed, with a&#xD;
sigh of relief. "How dreadful was all that pomp&#xD;
and glitter! *How fortunate I am to have es-&#xD;
caped from those torturing, horrible riches !&#xD;
That wealth was consuming me  like licking&#xD;
flames-that load of ill-gotten money crushing&#xD;
my poor brain-my poor brain. Now       I am&#xD;
free, free! and will seek a home where poverty,&#xD;
and peace, and happiness abide."&#xD;
With almost preternatural adroitness he picked&#xD;
his way, in spite of the obscurity, over his grounds&#xD;
and out at a postern gate to the open road. He&#xD;

walked along rapidly, and seemed intent on&#xD;
reaching the town. He changed his apparent&#xD;
intention, however, for he retraced his steps and&#xD;
turned abruptly into a by-path that led along the&#xD;
river-side.  On he went towards the cliff, pro-&#xD;
ceeding as unerringly as if in broad daylight,&#xD;
and without the slightest hesitation, guided, per-&#xD;
haps, by some instinct similar to the marvellous&#xD;
second-sight of the somnambulist.  The least&#xD;
deviation might have brought him to the edge of&#xD;
the precipice. At length he reached the foot-&#xD;
bridge. It was a frail structure of wood span-&#xD;
ning the chasm, with its ends resting on the lofty&#xD;
basaltic walls. Mr. Heath was about to cross&#xD;
this bridge, but stopped midway and gazed in&#xD;
the direction of the town only to be distinguished&#xD;
by the faint glimmer of a few lights. He seemed&#xD;
absorbed in reflection, and stood there in that&#xD;
wild, rainy night, -unmindful of the cold and&#xD;
wet, and motionless amid the continual thunder&#xD;
of the falling waters, visible through the black-&#xD;
ness in swiftly agitated scrolls of snowy foam-&#xD;
But his thoughts were elsewhere; back to the&#xD;
time when he was a young man beginning life,&#xD;
and had seen the boy Move standing on that&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
bridge with his little sister by him! The two&#xD;
children were staring in open-eyed, awe at the&#xD;
appalling depth below them, and the boy held&#xD;
the girl tightly by the hand in precaution. It&#xD;
seemed but yesterday. He, Heath, then a clerk,&#xD;
was taking some papers to Mr. Obershaw, when&#xD;
he passed those two innocent children on the&#xD;
bridge. Better for them-far better, had he&#xD;
flung them both into the raging torrent below!&#xD;
Again he met the boy at old Van Slyke's store.&#xD;
There was a dispute about a missing bank-note,&#xD;
and the lad was in dismay at the loss. He,&#xD;
Heath, had seen the note fall on the floor, and&#xD;
put his foot on it. He could distinctly recall the&#xD;
feeling of gratification with which he slyly se-&#xD;
cured it, and the singular superstitious prompt-&#xD;
ing that induced him to buy a lottery ticket with&#xD;
it. That bank-note had borne him luck, and&#xD;
proved the corner-stone of his opulence and&#xD;
grandeur ; and its loss had entailed the destruc-&#xD;
tion of two souls! What fearful, fatal results&#xD;
from so light a theft! How deeply had the boy&#xD;
fallen-a malefactor, a deeply-dyed murderer,&#xD;
and his sister-that helpless child! 0 Christ!&#xD;
that awful conscience-throe! Why had he not&#xD;

sent them  both to eternity then?  Better for&#xD;
them and for him. Mercy,' mercy ! that terrible&#xD;
lead-like load is coming again, and pressing-&#xD;
pressing so fearfully on the throbbing brain.&#xD;
Help-O.God!     .   .    .&#xD;
Easier now-'&#xD;
and hark! A voice seems calling to him. No,&#xD;
it's but the sighing wind. Oh for rest, and for-&#xD;

Take all-all! and give me that. Cannot wealth&#xD;
buy it ? It is there, though-down there ! How&#xD;
quietly those black boulders sleep amid that&#xD;
boiling foam. One leap and I am free!&#xD;
With a frantic toss of his arms Rufus Heath&#xD;
flung himself off the bridge. A form vanished&#xD;
into the dark abyss, and all was over. Sullenly&#xD;
and persistently, as before, the Passaic plunged&#xD;
over the steep, bearing in its rapid tide the mag-&#xD;
nifico of Belton, like a drifting log.&#xD;
Early the next morning, as some artisans were&#xD;
going to their work and walking along the river-&#xD;
side, their attention was attracted by a partly&#xD;
submerged object near the bank. It was the&#xD;
body of Rufus Heath, kept to the surface by the&#xD;

swirl of an eddy. With the assistance of a boat,&#xD;
the corpse was drawn ashore, and kept there&#xD;
until the coroner could be summoned.   Like&#xD;
wild-fire the news spread through Belton, and&#xD;
crowds hurried to see the drowned body of its&#xD;
chief citizen.&#xD;
And then through the circle of gaping, curious&#xD;
spectators came a cry of anguish that separated&#xD;
them like the thrust of a sword ; and they hustled&#xD;
aside as the daughter hastened with faltering&#xD;
steps to her dead father. With clasped hands,&#xD;
knit brows, and brimming eyes the poor child&#xD;
knelt to embrace the wet and bruised head. Her&#xD;
low quivering sobs awed them all, until George&#xD;

arms, raised her fainting form, and bore her&#xD;
away.&#xD;

THE huge battlemented villa on the cliff was&#xD;
a gloomy enough residence since the death of its&#xD;
owner. The remaining occupants, oppressed by,&#xD;
their bereavement, moved about the silent rooms&#xD;
like shadows. Mrs. Applegate was of the opinion&#xD;
that a change of scene was absolutely necessary&#xD;
to dissipate Edna's excessive grief,. and that a&#xD;
continued stay in their present habitation might&#xD;
tend to impair her health. Edna; however,&#xD;
seemed reluctant to leave her home, and it was.&#xD;
only at the urgent solicitation of the Mumbies&#xD;
that she did so. Mr. Mumbie was one of the ex-&#xD;
ecutors of Mr. Heath's will, and was also ap-&#xD;
pointed Edna's guardian. Mr. Mumbie felt the&#xD;
loss of his old friend Rufus Heath deeply. His&#xD;
first impulse was to put his whole family in&#xD;
mourning, but on second thoughts he confined&#xD;
himself to delivering a eulogy on the character&#xD;
of the deceased to every one he met, prefacing it&#xD;
by the sage remark, solemnly delivered, that it&#xD;
&#xD;
was a very sudden death. As this was a propo-&#xD;
sition that did not admit of much controversy, the&#xD;
listener generally coincided. "Ah! sir, such is&#xD;
life," continued Mr. Mumble, addressing Dr. Wat-&#xD;
tietop, who added, "And death,"&#xD;
"Very true-and death,", repeated Mr. Mum-&#xD;
bie, pausing to reflect, as if this side of the axiom&#xD;
*  had never struck him before, "and death, as you&#xD;
very justly remark. Ah! sir, at a moment like&#xD;
the present, how hollow everything looks! What's&#xD;
money at a time like this ? How transitory and&#xD;
vain are our pursuits-everything, in fact!"&#xD;
"Paper-mills, for instance," observed the doctor.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, every worldly matter; and the reflec-&#xD;
tion will force itself upon us, that in the midst of&#xD;
life we are in death, and there's no use kicking&#xD;
against it. Now Mr. Heath was a very peculiar&#xD;
man; I knew him thoroughly. We had been&#xD;
much together from boyhood, and we were always&#xD;
like brothers-if anything, rather more intimate&#xD;
and affectionate than brothers. We began life&#xD;
together; to be sure, Ihad a little the start of&#xD;
him, but then our tastes and sympathies were ex-&#xD;
actly alike to a shade. Mr. Heath, sir (impres-&#xD;
sively), was a very remarkable man-very remark-&#xD;

able man, indeed. He was not only a scholar,&#xD;
and a Christian, but a gentleman as well. He&#xD;
was also, if I may be allowed the expression,&#xD;
a high-toned man-very high-toned indeed,&#xD;
sir. He was a . man of wonderful abilities,&#xD;
wide scope (with a circular flourish to exemplify&#xD;
the scope), and great grasp (clenching his large&#xD;
fist)-great grasp of intellect. I will state to you,&#xD;
and I trust you will see the importance of not re-&#xD;

I was consulted in regard to a plan on foot-a&#xD;

it is sufficient to say that they were our most super-&#xD;
eminent men ; consulted, sir, in regard to a plan&#xD;
that would eventually have set Mr. Heath on the&#xD;
very pinnacle of greatness-the very pinnacle."&#xD;
"Rather an uncomfortable seat, I should&#xD;
fancy," commented the doctor.&#xD;
Mr. Mumbie stared with a puzzled expression&#xD;
at the physician. He never could understand&#xD;
him, and took refuge ii repeating the eulogy in&#xD;
succession to Blanks the stationer, and to Snopple&#xD;
the photographer. Mr. Snopple acquiesced fully&#xD;
in Mr. Mumbie's estimate of Mr. Heath's character&#xD;

and virtLes, and stated that any one could see with&#xD;
half an eye, by merely looking at a portrait of the&#xD;
defunct gentleman, that he was no ordinary mortal,&#xD;
but had a very instructive and superior physiog-&#xD;
nomy; and that, by the bye, reminded him that he&#xD;
had in his studio a very fine negative representing&#xD;
Mr. Heath in three-quarter face and characteristic&#xD;
pose, from which copies could be struck off, which&#xD;
he would agree to furnish colored, if preferred,&#xD;
in the highest style of art, for twenty dollars&#xD;
each, frame included; and which would be an&#xD;
ornament to any parlor, and one that no family&#xD;
in Belton should be without.&#xD;
Mr. Mumbie said he would see about it. Mr.&#xD;
Mumnbie had no time to think of anything just&#xD;
then. He was overwhelmed with the responsi-&#xD;
bilities thrust upon him.&#xD;
"The fiduciary obligations imposed on me by&#xD;
the death of my friend Mr. Heath, are very great&#xD;
--very great indeed, and onerous (with a sigh).&#xD;
Still it is a duty I must perform; a sacred trust&#xD;
and burden I must accept., We must all bow to&#xD;

pleted and perfected his reconcilement to the&#xD;
decrees of Providence.&#xD;
To do hiin justice, he was a faithful guardian&#xD;
and trustee ; and as for his wife, she outdid her-.&#xD;
self in motherly solicitude for the young heiress,&#xD;
whom she immediately took under her protecting&#xD;
wing.&#xD;
Edna, Mrs. Mumbie insisted, must come and&#xD;
live with her. She must be removed at once&#xD;
from the painful associations connected with her&#xD;
old home, as Mrs. Applegate had very wisely ad-&#xD;
vised, and her guardian's family was the place&#xD;
for her. Edna complied, and the Mumbies treat-&#xD;
ed her like a favorite child. The best room in&#xD;
the house was allotted to her, and nothing was&#xD;
considered too good for dear Edna. So the stately&#xD;
dwelling of the late Mr. Heath was abandoned,&#xD;
and given over to the care of the gardener, as&#xD;
Mrs. Applegate, who had been handsomely pro-&#xD;
vided for in her brother's will, departed to take&#xD;
up her residence in Philadelphia with an aged&#xD;
relative.&#xD;
Mrs. Mumbie had ulterior views in regard to&#xD;
Edna. The desirableness of securing that young&#xD;
lady as a helpmeet for her son Bob, had not&#xD;

escaped the attention of this sagacious and good&#xD;
mother, and .she decided to bring it about. Let&#xD;
us add, too, that whatever Mrs. Mumble determined&#xD;
to do she generally accomplished, as her husband&#xD;
had discovered at the outset of his connubial life.&#xD;
Mr. Mumble had a very high opinion of his&#xD;
spouse's ability, and no little dread of her temper.&#xD;
She came of one of the very first of the celebrat-&#xD;
ed first-families of Virginia, the Skinners, and&#xD;
was connected, moreover, on her mother's side&#xD;
with the Yallabushas of Mississippi. Everybody&#xD;
had heard of her father, Colonel Roger Skinner,&#xD;
of Pokomoke, one of the first poker-players of&#xD;
his day, whose true Southern hospitality and&#xD;
peach-brandy were the themes of universal com-&#xD;
mendation. Mumble met the fascinating Miss Sal-&#xD;
lie Skinner first at Saratoga, where he at once suc-&#xD;
cumbed to the potent bewitchment of her raven&#xD;
hair and brilliant eyes. He ventured, after many&#xD;
misgivings, to propose, -and was accepted, much&#xD;
to his surprise and delight, as he had hardly&#xD;
dared to hope that such a divinity would link&#xD;
herself with an ordinary mortal. Other people,&#xD;
who had heard the vivacious belle ridicule poor&#xD;

veiled too; but the truth was she had accepted&#xD;
him in a fit of spite at some recreant lover's deser-&#xD;
tion. Of course the marriage-was considered a&#xD;
misalliance in the aristocratic circles of Poko-&#xD;
moke, and the bride's relatives for a while treated&#xD;
the paper-maker rather contemptuously, but&#xD;
as poker and peach-brandy had seriously im..&#xD;
paired the substance of the Skinner family, they&#xD;
gradually became reconciled to the match, and&#xD;
condescended to accept largess from the wealthy&#xD;
manufacturer. Mr. Mumbie had a heart corre-&#xD;
sponding in size to his ears and feet, and proved&#xD;
a perfect dove and treasure of a husband. Ma-&#xD;
licious tongues said he dared not be otherwise,&#xD;
for the first and only time'he attempted to cross&#xD;
his wife, she simply flung herself on the carpet,&#xD;
and beat a tattoo with her heels, screeching terri-&#xD;
bly the while, until Mumbie, frightened and sub-&#xD;
jected, promised anything and everything to&#xD;
avoid a repetition of the scene. This, to be sure,&#xD;
was in the early period of their union. Now&#xD;
Mr. Mumbie, through long servitude, was so thor-&#xD;
oughly broken to harness and under control, and&#xD;
Mrs. Mumbie had gained such undisputed and&#xD;
serene ascendancy, that stratagems were unnec-&#xD;

essary, and she ruled through superior force of&#xD;
character.&#xD;
This was the energetic and ingenious lady who&#xD;
determined to direct the destiny of her husband's&#xD;
ward, and relieve her from the trouble and diffi-&#xD;
culty of selecting a husband. To gain her ends,&#xD;
she surrounded Edna with every attention, and&#xD;
was more than a mother to her in fact, pending&#xD;
the time when she would be one in law. The&#xD;
young heiress began to find herself installed as a&#xD;
being of immense importance, and was much&#xD;
surprised at the vast amount of consideration&#xD;
shown to her by her elders. She was shrewd&#xD;
enough to suspect that much of it was due to her&#xD;
wealth, and despised it accordingly; for there&#xD;
was too much good sense in the girl, and her&#xD;
character was too frank and independent to yield&#xD;
readily to the pernicious influence of parasitism.&#xD;
The correspondence which had been kept up&#xD;
with regularity between Edna and her soldier-&#xD;
lover was interrupted by the death of her father,&#xD;
Mark's intuitive delicacy forbidding him for a&#xD;
time from intruding on the grief of a mourning&#xD;
daughter, further than in sending a formal letter&#xD;

of condolence. It must be admitted, too, that&#xD;
Edna in her grief had but few thoughts to bestow&#xD;
on the suitor who was serving another mistress in&#xD;
the swamps of the Chickahominy. At length, to&#xD;
make amends for her negligence, she wrote him&#xD;
a long epistle, the superscription of which hap-&#xD;
pened to meet Miss Ada Mumbie's eye. Not-&#xD;
withstanding the intimacy existing between the&#xD;
two young ladies, and contrary to the usual cus-&#xD;
tom in such cases, Miss Heath had never confided&#xD;
her tender regard for Mark Gildersleeve to her&#xD;
friend Miss Mumbie. The latter, anxious to&#xD;
know if any such feeling existed, taxed Edna&#xD;
with it, and affected pique at her want of confi-&#xD;
dence. That young lady at once, with a blush,&#xD;
admitted the soft impeachment. Ada Mumbie&#xD;
was an outspoken young lady, and took after her&#xD;
mamma in respect to having an opinion of her&#xD;
own. - She raised her eyebrows very significantly&#xD;
at Edna's confession, saying: " Why-Ed-na&#xD;
Heath, the i-dea I I declare, I am surprised be-&#xD;
yond anything. I never would have thought it.&#xD;
He may be a very industrious, excellent young&#xD;
man, but so very much your inferior in every&#xD;
way. Why, he's not even a person you could&#xD;

Why, what can you be thinking of ?"&#xD;
Edna, nettled at this, bridled up and answered,&#xD;
"I don't know what you mean by so much my&#xD;
inferior. He's far cleverer than I am, or you&#xD;
either, Ada. He's very refined and polite and&#xD;
gentlemanly,FIm sure; and just as good as gold."&#xD;
"Mercy on us, Edna! I declare I didn't know&#xD;
you were so very much interested in him, or I&#xD;
wouldn't have ventured to say a word. To be sure,&#xD;
my acquaintance with the gentleman is so very&#xD;
slight that I am hardly competent to judge of&#xD;
him. I expressed myself as I did solely out of&#xD;
friendship for you. You know very well that&#xD;
the position you occupy in society, and your large&#xD;
fortune-"&#xD;
" Ada, you might have spared me that last re-&#xD;
mark," interrupted Edna in a vexed tone. "I&#xD;
hear so much about my fortune-my wealth, that&#xD;
I detest the very mention of it. Oblige me,&#xD;
please, by never again alluding to it in my pres-&#xD;
ence."&#xD;

word about it: there now ; " said Miss Mumbie,&#xD;
and Edna kissed her friend in token of amity&#xD;
and restored concord. The friend intended to&#xD;
be a valuable auxiliary to her mamma in bring-&#xD;
ing about, in time, a match between her brother&#xD;
Bob and the young heiress; but she found she&#xD;
had made a misstep. Thus far, though attentive&#xD;
and agreeable in his clumsy way, Bob did not&#xD;
seem to make any appreciable progress in his&#xD;
suit. When his sister imparted the discovery&#xD;
she had made, to wit: that be had a rival,&#xD;
and one that Edna seemed to evince considera-&#xD;
ble partiality for, he redoubled his efforts to&#xD;
please. Unfortunately, Bob was not a being cal-&#xD;
culated to captivate the fair. His physical graces&#xD;
were few, and his mental less, and he only served&#xD;
to amuse Miss Heath until he succeeded in bo-&#xD;
ring her. She, rightfully ascribing this increase&#xD;
of homage on the part of the enamored Bob to&#xD;
her ingenuous declaration to his sister, rather&#xD;
regretted it, especially as she feared having per-&#xD;
haps shown too much warmth in 'her defence&#xD;
of Mark Gildersleeve. Thenceforth by a tacit&#xD;
understanding, the subject was not again re-&#xD;
ferred to between the two girls.&#xD;

Mrs. Mumbie, on learning of the danger to her&#xD;
SOnS prospects, determined to nip it in the bud.&#xD;
" I am really astonished," said she to her hus,&#xD;
band, "that so well-bred a girl could have&#xD;
allowed her thoughts to stray away so unguard-&#xD;
edly. A machinist, dear me, how low! Working&#xD;
with a hammer-all over oil, and grease, and&#xD;
smoke. It's positively amazing what crazy no-&#xD;
tions girls will get in their heads. I suppose,&#xD;
though, it's all owing to his turning soldier. Of&#xD;
course, it's nothing but a mere girlish fancy, but&#xD;
it might grow unless checked. Change of scene&#xD;
and a new train of ideas will soon dissipate the&#xD;
foolish whim. A tour abroad is just the very&#xD;
thing-the very thing. Mr. Mumbie, we must&#xD;
go to Europe."&#xD;
"But, my dear, it's impossible to go now. I&#xD;
can't leave-"&#xD;
"Mr. Mumbie, we must go to Europe," was&#xD;
repeated with emphasis, "and the sooner the&#xD;
better. Speak to Edna on the subject at once-&#xD;
she needs the voyage. Ada needs it-so does&#xD;
Bob. It's time they saw something of the world,&#xD;
.and it will improve their minds vastly."&#xD;
Mr. Mumbie did as he was bid. Edna was&#xD;

delighted at the idea of a trip to Europe, and&#xD;
readily assented to her guardian's proposal. At&#xD;
the same time he deemed it well to improve the'&#xD;
opportunity, in view of what he had learnt re-&#xD;
specting his ward's inclinations, by imparting&#xD;
some information which might tend to give her&#xD;
a better estimate of her worth and position in the&#xD;
world than she seemed to possess.&#xD;
" Edna, I believe I have never spoken a word&#xD;
to you about business matters. I thought it&#xD;
would be as well to get everything into shape be-&#xD;
fore I said anything. Of course it is something&#xD;
that you don't know much about, and yet I sup-&#xD;
pose I ought to ascertain if you've any wishes in&#xD;
regard to the management of the estate, and so&#xD;
forth. If so, I am ready to take them into con-&#xD;
sideration," said Mr. Mumble.&#xD;
" I have one wish, sir," said Edna.&#xD;
"Well, what is it ? "&#xD;
"I should like to have father's intentions car-&#xD;
ried out in regard to building the Home and&#xD;
the Hospital, exactly as if he were alive," said&#xD;
Edna earnestly.&#xD;
"But, my child, that would. cost a great deal&#xD;
of money, a very great deal, and-"&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
"I don't care if it takes all the estate; I pre-&#xD;
same there is enough to do it," said Edna deci4-&#xD;
edly.&#xD;
"Of course there's enough and more than&#xD;
enough, but I should not be justified or permit-&#xD;
ted to use any funds in that way. So there's&#xD;
no use in saying anything more about it now.&#xD;
When you come of age, why then, we can talk it&#xD;
over again if you're of the same mind. Now,&#xD;
Edna," continued Mr. Mumbie, taking up a roll&#xD;
of paper, "I've got something to show you that&#xD;
will interest you. I have prepared and completed,&#xD;
after a great deal of labor, an inventory of your&#xD;
late lamented father's estate. The estimates are,&#xD;
if anything, in many cases below the real values.&#xD;
Here is the schedule--and what do you think it&#xD;
all foots up ? What do you think it all amounts&#xD;
to in dollars and cents?"&#xD;
"6I don't know," replied Edna. " A great deal,&#xD;
I've no doubt."&#xD;

bie with an air of triumph.&#xD;
"Please don't ask me; Pd rather not," said&#xD;
Edna seriously.&#xD;

you want to know how much you are worth?"&#xD;
"No-no-" said Edna quickly, and shaking&#xD;
her head.&#xD;
"Why-why not?"&#xD;
" Because-because-" said Edna, her eyes sud-&#xD;
denly moistening, and sensitive mouth quivering.&#xD;
Mr. Mumble looked perplexed. "Why, Edna,&#xD;
it is clearly your duty that you should gain some&#xD;
knowledge of the way in which the vast for-&#xD;
tune you have inherited is invested. You must&#xD;
begifto learn something about it, and about taking&#xD;
care of it. It is very seldom that so young a per-&#xD;
son is so fortunate as to have such riches left them,&#xD;
and_"&#xD;
Edna burst into tears. "Oh, please, sir, don't&#xD;
say anything to me about it now. I suppose it's&#xD;
very wrong in me, but they all talk to me so&#xD;
about my wealth, that it makes me feel wretched.&#xD;
They appear to envy me-and to think I ought&#xD;
to be so happy in being rich, until it seems as if&#xD;
they thought I had profited by my poor-poor&#xD;
father's death. I wish I were poor and had&#xD;
nothing."&#xD;
This is very extraordinary indeed, thought Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mumble, who imagined he had prepared a pleas-&#xD;
ant surprise for his ward. "Well, well, Edna,&#xD;
dry your eyes, my child. We won't talk business&#xD;
if you don't like it. Mrs. Mumbie says she thinks&#xD;
the trip to Europe will do you good, and 've no&#xD;
doubt it will. So get ready and we'll all be off&#xD;
as soon as possible."&#xD;
In less than a fortnight after this conversation&#xD;
Edna, and the Mumbie family with the exception&#xD;
of the youngest member, were at sea on their way&#xD;
to Liverpool. Before leaving, Edna wrote a letter&#xD;
to Mark, bidding him an affectionate farewell;&#xD;
promising that her absence would be but a short&#xD;
1one, and reiterating her oft-expressed wish that&#xD;
the war would soon end and enable him to return&#xD;
home safe and famous, By the time this epistle&#xD;
.reached its destination the one it was addressed&#xD;
to was a captive in the hands of the enemy. An&#xD;
expedition had been planned to make a dash in-&#xD;
to the capital of the Confederacy and rescue the&#xD;
prisoners confined on Belie Isle. Mark Gilder-&#xD;
sleeve took part in this hazardous undertaking&#xD;
which through lack of support failed., and lhe with&#xD;
a few others as rashly venturesome, were surround-&#xD;

number wounded. Among the latter Mark, who&#xD;
received on that occasion a carbine bullet in his&#xD;
bridle-arm, which he repaid by lodging the con-&#xD;
tents of his revolver into two of his assailants.&#xD;
Another shot, however, disabled his horse, and he&#xD;
was made prisoner. He suffered severely from&#xD;
his wound, owing to a want of proper medical at-&#xD;
tendance; but fortunately the ball, which had&#xD;
taken an erratic course, was easily extracted, and&#xD;
his vigorous constitution did the rest. He spent&#xD;
some five weary months in Castle Thunder and&#xD;
was then exchanged. On his ,return to his regi-&#xD;
ment he found the letter from Edna, announcing&#xD;
her departure for Europe, awaitinghim. Ie had&#xD;
written to her several times during his captivity,&#xD;
without receiving any reply; now her silence was&#xD;
explained. His letters had probably not been&#xD;
forwarded properly, or if forwarded had not&#xD;
reached her. He had had an almost irresistible&#xD;
inclination to revisit Belton, but now that it was&#xD;
bereft of its chief attraction the desire vanished,&#xD;
and he returned to his duty, with an increased&#xD;
determinatkn to carve his way to distinction at&#xD;
whatever cost.&#xD;

Meanwhile Miss Heath and her friends had&#xD;
arrived in Europe. It was her first visit there,&#xD;
and she found so much that was novel and pleas-&#xD;
iig that her mind was constantly occupied and&#xD;
diverted. Some time was spent travelling through&#xD;
England and Scotland; then they proceeded on&#xD;
the usual tour through the Continent, making a&#xD;
lengthened stay in Paris. The following summer&#xD;
was passed in Switzerland and at the German&#xD;
watering-places. In the former country they met&#xD;
some pleasant English people, and among them&#xD;
a party of Cambridge students.  One of the&#xD;
Cantabs was very attentive to the young ladies,&#xD;
and Edna declared he was the. most entertaining&#xD;
and agreeable young gentleman she had ever&#xD;
met. He was handsome withal, judging from a&#xD;
description of him given in a letter of Edna's&#xD;
to her friend Constance Hull, in which she said:&#xD;
"His complexion is just lilies and roses-in fact&#xD;
it exactly matches the blush-rose in his button-&#xD;
hole; and his large, limpid irids are of forget-me-&#xD;
not blue--suggestive hue! Everything's 'awful&#xD;
jolly' with him, and he makes the ,nicest bever-&#xD;
ages with sherry and claret, and sliced cucum-&#xD;
bers, called 'claret-cup,' or something of that&#xD;

&#xD;
sort, but at any rate, it's perfectly delicious; and&#xD;
he's just as full of fun as he can be, and always&#xD;
ready for some frolic or other." Such delightful&#xD;
walks and excursions as they enjoyed together,&#xD;
and how sorry they all were to part with him.&#xD;
Even Mrs. Mumbie seemed to regret the separa-&#xD;
tion, perhaps because he was the nephew of a&#xD;
lord, and had paid some attention to Ada, who&#xD;
certainly was- smitten with him. As for Edna,&#xD;
she was suspiciously quiet for a few days after&#xD;
his departure, and we fear that during that time&#xD;
her thoughts seldom reverted to her absent suitor,&#xD;
the striving Union volunteer. But his image&#xD;
arose again to reproach her, as she reflected that&#xD;
she had not written a line to him in a very long&#xD;
while. To be sure he had not replied to her&#xD;
last epistle; in fact, she had written three or four&#xD;
without receiving any response, and had half&#xD;
made up her mind not to write again until she&#xD;
had received an acknowledgment of her letters.&#xD;
Perhaps, thought she, they may not have reached&#xD;
him. Still he might write to me at all events.&#xD;
Poor fellow! who knows, he may be sick, or&#xD;
wounded,.or in prison. Dear me, I've been so&#xD;
distracted with all I've seen and heard, that I'm&#xD;
&#xD;
afraid I don't think as often of him as I ought&#xD;
to. I'll sit down at once and write him a good,&#xD;
kind, long letter to make amends. And she did&#xD;
so, but it met a fate similar to the previous ones,&#xD;
bearing the same superscription, that she had&#xD;
sent, and found- its way, we regret to say, into&#xD;
the hands of Mrs. Madison Mumble, who con-&#xD;
signed the tender lines to congenial flames, after&#xD;
having cynically perused them. While in Paris,&#xD;
Edna, in recognition of the kindness shown her&#xD;
by her guardian's family, had presented the&#xD;
mother and the daughter with expensive parures&#xD;
of diamonds. The one selected for Mrs. Mumbie&#xD;
was in particular composed of the finest and&#xD;
most costly stones. Mrs. Mumbie was profuse&#xD;
and almost abject in her acknowledgments and&#xD;
thanks to dear Edna. Could that generous young&#xD;
heart have known that this velvety woman had&#xD;
been treacherously intercepting her correspond-&#xD;
ence-rifling the depositaries of her secret&#xD;
thoughts, she would have shrunk from her as&#xD;
from a reptile. But to youthful innocence base-&#xD;
ness such as this exists not.&#xD;
The next winter was spent in Italy, chiefly in&#xD;
Rome. Edna's enthusiasm for the glorious old&#xD;

city knew no bounds. Between sight-seeing and&#xD;
shopping she had not an idle moment. The&#xD;
quantities of silken sashes and jewels of coral and&#xD;
mosaic she bought for presents, and the money&#xD;
she spent and flung away to lazzaroni, would have&#xD;
driven her grandfather Obershaw as wild as Shy-&#xD;
lock was at Jessica's extravagance. She created&#xD;
a great sensation among the artists.. The sculp-&#xD;
tors wanted to model her lips and chin, and the&#xD;
painters raved about her hair and complexion ;&#xD;
altogether, between the studios, the ruins, the Car-&#xD;
nival, and what not, she was having, as she ex-&#xD;
pressed it in her correspondence with Miss Hull,&#xD;
"a splendid time."     There was a long postscript&#xD;
to that letter to this effect:&#xD;
P. S. You remember I mentioned in my last, that we had&#xD;
engaged a new courier in Paris, a handsome Italian named&#xD;
Luigi, who was so very refined and distingus-looking, and such&#xD;
an excellent linguist. Well -the secret is out ! He is a&#xD;
Count, and his name is Borgia, Count Gasparone Alessandro&#xD;
Borgia, a scion of the illustrious family of that name-just&#xD;
think of it ! He betrayed himself to Ada in an unguarded&#xD;
moment. He was stripped of his patrimony by confiscation,&#xD;
and adopted his present vocation the better to elude the ma-&#xD;
lignity of his enemies, who are continually seeking to perse-&#xD;
cute him. Who those enemies are, I do not clearly under-&#xD;
stand. Sometimes he says they are the Jesuits, and at other&#xD;
times he accuses Mazzini and the red-republicans. He hints&#xD;
&#xD;
RK GILDEsLEEVE.                803&#xD;
also at hereditary foes of his house, the Orsini and Sforzi.&#xD;
Evidently he shrinks with intuitive delicacy from speaking of&#xD;
himself and his misfortunes, and feels his position keenly.&#xD;
Ada caught him in tears once or twice mourning the deca-&#xD;
dence of his house. lHeassuredher, on his word of honor, that&#xD;
all the stories that were in circulation respecting the poisoning&#xD;
propensities of his family are malicious falsehoods, and is very&#xD;
indignant at the outrageous way in which the dramatists have&#xD;
treated his distinguished ancestress-and I don't wonder at&#xD;
his anger. I think he says she was his great-great-grand-&#xD;
aunt; but I won't be certain. Since we have learned his&#xD;
title and rank, we have all felt a delicacy in treating him as&#xD;
a courier. Mr. Mumbie almost insisted on his taking his&#xD;
meals with us, but he firmly, and dignifiedly refused, which I&#xD;
think was very honorable in him, don't you? I flatter myself&#xD;
not a little on my sagacity and knowledge of people that I&#xD;
felt certain the moment I saw him that he was no ordinary&#xD;
person. The seal of high birth is unmistakably set on his&#xD;
noble brow and statuesque features; and then, 0 Constance,&#xD;
such eyes ! such flashing, mElting orbs ! . . .&#xD;
The Fosters leave for home next week. I intrusted them&#xD;
with a present for you which they kindly consented to de-&#xD;
liver. It's a turquoise set, and I hope it will suit you. I'm&#xD;
sure it will be becoming. I did intend to surprise you with&#xD;
it myself, but it's so uncertain when we shall return that I&#xD;
thought I would avail of the opportunity to send it at once.&#xD;
Please accept the set with the best love of&#xD;
Ever yours,&#xD;

XVIII,&#xD;
IT is not our purpose to follow Mark closely in&#xD;
his career during the war. Suffice it to say, that&#xD;
after his exchange he had rejoined his corps, and&#xD;
taken part in the memorable battle of Gettysburg,&#xD;
where the legions of the South, flushed with vic-&#xD;
tory, were checked in their advance on Northern&#xD;
soil, and driven back by the Union soldiers.&#xD;
With steady courage he perseveringly sought lau-&#xD;
rels. His gallant bearing on several occasions at-&#xD;
tracted the notice of his superior officers, and his&#xD;
noteworthy conduct in leading an attack on the&#xD;
forces of GeneralImboden on the Cashtown road,,&#xD;
whereby a large number of rebels were cut off&#xD;
and captured, won him the grade of major. The&#xD;
young fellow, as we mentioned, started in life with&#xD;
an unusual stock of vanity, fortunately counter-&#xD;
balanced by a chivalrous spirit and scorn of the&#xD;
mean. Much of this vanity had been eliminated,&#xD;
probably on the homeopathic principle of like&#xD;
curing Life, for his profession was one decidedly&#xD;
&#xD;
calculated to foster that weakness. He was sensi-&#xD;
ble enough, however, to avoid the arrogance en-&#xD;
gendered by the possession of authority of which&#xD;
he saw so many examples, and better still to pre-&#xD;
serve his soul from that callousness and ferocity&#xD;
which 'are the worst fruits 'of horrid war. He&#xD;
felt the insidious approaches of the baleful influ-&#xD;
ences, but resisted. Bearing in mind, also, his old&#xD;
friend's injunction to beware of the sway of preju-&#xD;
dice over reason, he strove to be just and unbi-&#xD;
assed. There was some of the old paladin spirit&#xD;
in Mark. He recognized among the enemy many&#xD;
who were as earnest and sincere in their cause as&#xD;
he was in his; perhaps he was frequently led to&#xD;
think that the advantage in that respect was on&#xD;
their side, as he saw with inexpressible disgust the&#xD;
host of mercenaries whose sole thought was how&#xD;
to turn their country's misfortunes to profit, and,&#xD;
worse than all, lukewarm, disobedient generals,&#xD;
sacrificing their soldiers' lives to gratify some&#xD;
pique or partisan feeling. His blood boiled,&#xD;
too, at the unmentioned cruelties practised on the&#xD;
unfortunate race who had been the innocent cause&#xD;
of the fratricidal strife.  Jhis sympathy very&#xD;
nearly led him into serious trouble on one occa-&#xD;

sion. Among the regiments in the Army of the&#xD;
Potomac were several recruited from the dregs of&#xD;
the large cities of the North. Many of these men&#xD;
were without respect for their flag, and capable&#xD;
of any deed, or ready for any adventure that&#xD;
promised plunder or diversion. It was a common&#xD;
practice with them to shoot at any negro they&#xD;
found astray, in the vicinity of their camp.&#xD;
Mark, while away by himself one day in Virginia,&#xD;
came across a party of these fellows on some&#xD;
marauding expedition. Presently one of them&#xD;
espied a negro standing at the door of his cabin,&#xD;
near the edge of a wood, and without more ado,&#xD;
raised his musket and shot him dead. So enraged&#xD;
was Mark at this wanton murder, that, unable to&#xD;
contain himself, he drew his revolver and sent&#xD;
a bullet. into the assassin. He fell, seriously&#xD;
wounded. His companions were about to retali-&#xD;
ate, but intimidated by the major's bearing, and&#xD;
somewhat by his rank, hesitated, and concluded&#xD;
to report him at headquarters. The matter re-&#xD;
sulted in a court-martial, but Mark was acquit-&#xD;
ted with a reprimand.&#xD;
War either makes or mars a man. The soul is&#xD;
drawn so completely out of the commonplace&#xD;
&#xD;
grooves of ordinary life, so far from the shnk-.&#xD;
ing influences of wealth-seeking, and into an&#xD;
arena where emotions and passions contend so&#xD;
fiercely for mastery, that it comes out of the ordeal&#xD;
either sensibly debased or refined. Fortunately&#xD;
for Mark, it had purified his character; had&#xD;
given him a broader view of the aim and scope of&#xD;
life, enabling his will to crush out all vain hopes&#xD;
and envious desires, and find his pleasure in the     -&#xD;
performance of his duty and the approbation of&#xD;
his conscience. In short, he had become a true&#xD;
man. To how many, however, did the campaign&#xD;
prove a curse---how many contracted indolence,&#xD;
and habits that unfitted them for the avocations of&#xD;
peace, or 'exchanged their rectitude and purity&#xD;
of heart for vicious tastes that embittered their&#xD;
future lives.&#xD;
Time passed. Mark became attached to Gen-&#xD;
eral H---'s staff, and spent many months before&#xD;
Petersburg. It was there he performed an ex-&#xD;
ploit which has remained legendary in the annals             I&#xD;
of the war. During a night attack on one of our&#xD;
batteries, the rebels had succeeded in spiking a&#xD;
siege-gun w7~hich commanded their position, while&#xD;
it protected our working parties of sappers. As&#xD;

&#xD;
soon as the piece was rendered useless, the ene-&#xD;
my's sharp-shooters, swarming in rifle-pits close to&#xD;
our lines, seriously impeded further progress on&#xD;
our part. Vexed at this interruption, the com-&#xD;
mander called for volunteers to unspike the gun;&#xD;
but as this involved getting on the breech, and&#xD;
becoming a target for the foe while the work&#xD;
lasted, no one seemed willing to undertake it.&#xD;
In this dilemma, Mark, being known as a skilled&#xD;
machinist, was consulted; and after an examina-&#xD;
tion, he reported in favor of the practicability of&#xD;
the job, while admitting the extreme peril attend-&#xD;
ing it. Perhaps any intention of, executing it&#xD;
would have been abandoned, had not a comment,&#xD;
made 4y one of the men to another, to the effect&#xD;
that it was easy for officers to set tasks for pri-&#xD;
vates which they were not willing to do them-&#xD;
selves, been accidentally overheard by Mark,&#xD;
which stung him immediately into offering to&#xD;
accomplish the hazardous feat. Armed with&#xD;
several well-tempered bits and a brace, he went&#xD;
forth at nightfall on his perilous errand. Strad-&#xD;
dling the breech of the monstrous cannon, and&#xD;
crouching as low as possible, with the brace&#xD;
against his chest, he plied the drill vigorously.&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
r&#xD;
}&#xD;
}&#xD;
f&#xD;
&#xD;
Scarcely had he begun to work, when he was&#xD;
perceived by the vigilant rebel marksmen, who&#xD;
immediately opened fire. He could see the long&#xD;
rifle-pit, not a hundred yards distant, ablaze with&#xD;
the flash of fifty rifles, and feel the wind of their&#xD;
bullets as they whistled past him. Fortunately,&#xD;
favored somewhat by the obscurity, but far more&#xD;
by good luck, he remained unscathed, save by a&#xD;
skin-grazing touch. In fifteen minutes (it seemed&#xD;
to him an hour) the vent was clear ; a primer and&#xD;
lanyard were then passed up to him, and these&#xD;
affixed, he slipped off the cannon as quick as pos-&#xD;
sible. Seeing him drop, the rebels imagined they&#xD;
had shot him, and sent up a yell of exultation,&#xD;
which was suddenly checked as a discharge of&#xD;
grape from the liberated gun scattered death&#xD;
among them. Iark was not destined to escape&#xD;
entirely uninjured, for in his haste to get off the&#xD;
gun, and anxiety to avoid any danger from its&#xD;
recoil, he fell heavily, and was picked up with a&#xD;
dislocated shoulder. This accident, however, en-&#xD;
tailed but a short confinement, and he was soon&#xD;
able to be on duty again. Needless to add, that&#xD;
Mark received full meed of praise for his daring&#xD;

achievement, which furthermore earned him the&#xD;
grade of colonel.&#xD;
In this his hour of triumph and full flush of&#xD;
gratified vanity, one thought was constant and&#xD;
uppermost. How would Edna receive the news&#xD;
of his renown? If she felt but one momentary&#xD;
responsive throb of pride, he was repaid, and re-&#xD;
paid a hundred-fold, for all he had risked and&#xD;
undergone. But would she hear of him? Where&#xD;
was she ? Although he had written her several&#xD;
letters he had received none from her, since the&#xD;
one announcing her departure for Europe. Her&#xD;
silence was unaccountable. So long a time had&#xD;
elapsed that he began to despond. "Well, well,"&#xD;
thought he, "it's inexplicable, and useless to in-&#xD;
dulge in conjectures. I'll not do her the injus-&#xD;
tice to believe that it is intentional neglect on&#xD;
her part. We'll see what it all means when she&#xD;
returns. Meanwhile I must console myself by&#xD;
re-reading her old epistles."&#xD;
He occasionally received a communication&#xD;
from his sister-in-law, who kept him advised of&#xD;
all the Belton gossip-births, deaths, marriages,&#xD;
and so forth. At length one came, conveying&#xD;
the welcome intelligence that the Mumbies and&#xD;
&#xD;
their fair charge had returned home, Mrs.&#xD;
Gildersleeve stated that she had seen Miss Heath,&#xD;
sand that she was looking remarkably well, but&#xD;
exceedingly grand and dignified; adding, "You&#xD;
would hardly know your old sweetheart, now,&#xD;
Mark. She holds her head as high as a queen,&#xD;
and goes sweeping through the streets as if the&#xD;
earth were not good enough for her to tread on.&#xD;
I do not think, I am sorry to say, that travelling&#xD;
has improved her a bit." This was uncommonly&#xD;
severe criticism to come from the worthy lady,&#xD;
and amazed Mark ; but perhaps her opinion was&#xD;
somewhat .colored by the fact that Miss Heath&#xD;
had, unintentionally or otherwise, neglected to&#xD;
return Mrs. Gildersleeve's bow; an omission cer-&#xD;
tainly sufficient to bias the judgment of the least&#xD;
prejudiced woman who respects herself.&#xD;
There was a lull iii the conflict. The shock of&#xD;
arms and bruit of war gave place to the patient,&#xD;
silent work of the engineer. Inch by inch, the&#xD;
Union army advanced its lines of investment,&#xD;
and slowly the constricting circle was closing.&#xD;
Dull monotony succeeded, broken only by the&#xD;
occasional bursting of a shell over the trenches,&#xD;

or the crack of a sharp-shooter's rifle and ping&#xD;
of bullet, startling some too venturesome'spec-&#xD;
tator. Apart from this, all was inaction or weary&#xD;
routine. Deeming it a favorable time to apply&#xD;
for leave of absence, and longing to see Edna,&#xD;
Mark sought and obtained a furlough, and was&#xD;
speedily on his way north.&#xD;
It would be difficult to describe the Colonel's&#xD;
feelings as he approached his home. The antici-&#xD;
pated delight of meeting his friends, relatives,&#xD;
and above all, Edna, was mingled with a vague&#xD;
sense of apprehension-a premonition- of some&#xD;
disappointment that he could not shake off. He&#xD;
had been away full three years. It seemed to&#xD;
him at least ten; and he dreaded to be . con-&#xD;
fronted by unpleasant changes. Belton, at least,&#xD;
was still the same, and in its usual quiet mood.&#xD;
Contrary to the expectations of many of its inhabi-&#xD;
tants it had not as yet been invaded by the Reb-&#xD;
els ; still, as untiring vigilance was the price of&#xD;
liberty and safety the "Home Guard" kept up&#xD;
its organization and weekly drills, under the&#xD;
patriotic supervision of Captain George Gilder-&#xD;
'sleeve. The first thing that attracted Mark's at-&#xD;
tention, as he passed up Main Street, was- a full-&#xD;

length colored photograph in Snopple's show-case,&#xD;
of his brother, in all his panoply, figuring con-&#xD;
spicuously in company with portraits of Generals&#xD;
Grant and Sherman.&#xD;
Mark had hardly been in the town five min-&#xD;
utes, before the fact was known from one end of&#xD;
it to the other ; and Dr. Wattletop devoted him-&#xD;
self to informing everybody he met, that Mark&#xD;
Gildersleeve had returned from the "wars, bear-&#xD;
ing his blushing honors thick upon him."&#xD;
Of course the fatted calf was figuratively killed&#xD;
by Mrs. Gildersleeve, and the doctor took tea at&#xD;
her table that evening, and a joyful meal it was.&#xD;
The colonel noticed a marked change in his old&#xD;
friend.  Age was shrinking his once rotund&#xD;
form, and his countenance wore the expression of&#xD;
one seeking rest after a strife with life. His&#xD;
disputative spirit was apparently quenched, as he&#xD;
evinced no disposition to take up several thorny&#xD;
assertions on the part of the doughty captain of&#xD;
the " Home Guards," who monopolized the con-&#xD;
versation. This martinet criticised very severely&#xD;
the dilatory and bungling way in which the war&#xD;
was carried on, and set forth a plan of operations&#xD;
of his own, which, he was ready to back with any&#xD;

amount of money, would, if carried out by the&#xD;
commander-in-chief, bring the rebels to terms&#xD;
in the short space of time limited to three shakes&#xD;
of a sheep's tail. No one had -a stronger belief&#xD;
in himself than George Gildersleeve. It was a&#xD;
faith, too, that increased with his years and pros-&#xD;
perity, and perhaps had contributed not a little&#xD;
to the latter.&#xD;
As for the young colonel, he was singularly&#xD;
taciturn. Perhaps a little disappointed in find-&#xD;
ing that his lady-love had left the town, albeit&#xD;
it did not mitigate in any great degree the&#xD;
pleasure he felt in being once more in his old&#xD;
home. Certainly his appetite was not affected;&#xD;
and the quantity of clover-honey, of preserves,&#xD;
both quince and crab-apple, of stewed oysters,&#xD;
of Sally Lunn, and waffles he consumed, were&#xD;
sufficient to give an able-bodied ostrich a gastric&#xD;
derangement.&#xD;
After the meal they sat in the little parlor.&#xD;
Mark opened his long-neglected piano and tried&#xD;
a few bars of a favorite Nocture; but his stiff fin-&#xD;
gers made poor work of it. It was pleasanter to&#xD;
sit beside his second mother. There were a few&#xD;
more silver threads in her smooth hair, but her'se-&#xD;

rene, loving face seemed to him as young as ever.&#xD;
Presently the Reverend Samuel and Mrs. Snif-&#xD;
fen dropped in, for whom the colonel had to&#xD;
fight his battles o'er again.&#xD;
"And how about that exploit of yours, un-&#xD;
spiking the cannon? We've all heard of it,&#xD;
colonel," said the minister. "Mrs. Bradbury's&#xD;
son, who was there at the time, wrote a full ac-&#xD;
count of it home, but we want to listen to it from&#xD;
your lips."&#xD;
"Yes, yes, Hotspur, out with it," added the&#xD;
doctor. The red shone through Mark's gypsy&#xD;
cheek, as he gave a confused and stammering&#xD;
recital of the incident; and he felt decidedly re-&#xD;
lieved, when he had concluded, at his brother's&#xD;
blunt remark that he deserved to have been shot&#xD;
for his pains, as no one but a fool or a crazy man&#xD;
would have attempted such a job.&#xD;
"Mercy, George, don't say that !" said Mrs.&#xD;
Gildersleeve, who had been listening, pale and&#xD;
with a shudder, to Mark's narrative.&#xD;
" George is right," replied Mark; "it was noth-&#xD;
ing but a foolhardy freak, done on the spur of&#xD;
the moment ; and I 'would not have attempted&#xD;
it if I had taken time to reflect."&#xD;

&#xD;
The colonel was rather anxious to slur the&#xD;
feat; for, on analyzing the motives that impelled&#xD;
him to its performance, he was obliged to confess&#xD;
that it was pricked vanity and the desire to win&#xD;
Edna's admiration, rather than any stern sense of&#xD;
duty or devotion to his flag.&#xD;
"You never wrote me a word of all this, Mark,"&#xD;
said his sister-in-law, reproachfully. "However,&#xD;
perhaps it is just as well;" and addressing Mr.&#xD;
Sniffen, who was about taking his departure, she&#xD;
asked him if he would, before leaving, kindly&#xD;
lead in prayer, so that they might all return&#xD;
thanks for the safe return and preservation of&#xD;
Mark from so many dangers.     "You will join&#xD;
us, will you not, doctor?"&#xD;
"Most certainly, my dear lady," was the reply;&#xD;
and the old materialist, who had sought with a&#xD;
scalpel for the soul in a cadaver, the stoic, the&#xD;
Pythagorean, knelt and united in sincere devo-&#xD;
tion to the Father of all, whom we worship, each&#xD;
after his own little system, way, or fashion.&#xD;
After the departure of the guests, the circle&#xD;
around the grate-fire was still further narrowed,&#xD;
and Mrs. Gildersleeve opened her budget of&#xD;
news. She first inquired of Mark if he did not&#xD;

think the doctor had greatly changed? "Very&#xD;
much;" replied Mark.&#xD;
"Poor man," continued Mrs. Gildersleeve, "I&#xD;
feel so sorry and anxious about him. He has&#xD;
lost a great deal of his practice--almost all the&#xD;
paying part of it. He has still a host of patients,&#xD;
but they are mostly among the poor, from whom&#xD;
he gets little or no pay. I believe if he had all&#xD;
the money due him he would. be rich; but he&#xD;
never tries to collect anything. About six&#xD;
months ago his dog died-that large black one,&#xD;
that was always with him; and he cried like a&#xD;
child, said he had lost his best friend, and&#xD;
wrote a very singular obituary, that was published&#xD;
in the paper. After that he took to drinking&#xD;
very freely; and one day while under the in-&#xD;
fluence he struck with his cane a teamster who&#xD;
was beating a horse; and the man had him&#xD;
arrested, and if it hadn't been for your brother,&#xD;
the doctor would have been put in jail."&#xD;
"I think he served the teamster right,"ere-&#xD;
marked her husband, "only he didn't give him&#xD;
half enough."&#xD;
"Very likely; but the doctor made such a&#xD;
ridiculous speech about it in court. Spoke&#xD;

about animals having reason and souls, and that&#xD;
some men were inferior animals to the brutes;&#xD;
and accused the clergy of cowardice min shirking&#xD;
the question of the connection and duty of man&#xD;
to his fellow-animals, and a lot more of such&#xD;
stuff. To be sure he was under great excitement.&#xD;
Mr. Sniffen thinks the doctor got those perverted&#xD;
notions from living so long in India among the&#xD;
heathen. Since that time the doctor has not&#xD;
been the same man. He never touches a drop of&#xD;
anything, and he is always grave. He has failed,&#xD;
too, very much. Poor man! I feel so distressed&#xD;
about him, and was so rejoiced to see him join&#xD;
with us this evening in prayer. It is certainly&#xD;
very hard for a man of his years, f r he must be&#xD;
eighty, to be left without any one, away from&#xD;
relatives. I should so like to help him if I knew&#xD;
how to approach him without offending him.&#xD;
He is such a very peculiar person,"&#xD;
"It is his own fault," said George. "I offered&#xD;
to run him for coroner, or put him in as county&#xD;
physician, if he'd get naturalized and become a&#xD;
citizen ; but the pig-headed old duffer got as in-&#xD;
dignant as if I'd insulted him; talked about his&#xD;
sovereigih and her Gracious Majesty, until I shut&#xD;
&#xD;
him up. So he's no one to blame but himself.&#xD;
Ten o'clock, eh ? I'm off to bed. I suppose you&#xD;
and Maggie will talk here for three hours yet;"&#xD;
and George retired with a stretch and a yawn.&#xD;
When they were alone, Mrs. Gildersleeve&#xD;
touched on the topic nearest to her brother-in-&#xD;
law's "heart. It was done in the light of an&#xD;
apology. She said: "In one of my letters, I am&#xD;
ashamed to say, I spoke censoriously and un-&#xD;
justly of Miss Heath, and I wish to take it all&#xD;
back; but it shows how particular we ought to&#xD;
be not to judge hastily. Miss Heath, I suppose&#xD;
you know, has come into her property, and her&#xD;
first thought and care is to carry out her father's&#xD;
intentions about building those charitable insti-&#xD;
tutions. It will cost ever so much. I believe&#xD;
Mr. Mumbie tried to prevent or rather persuade&#xD;
her not to lay out so much money, but she&#xD;
wouldn't listen to it; and they say is even go-&#xD;
ing to spend more; but that's just like Edna&#xD;
Heath."&#xD;
How intensely the colonel's heart indorsed&#xD;
that opinion. "Where is she now ?" he inquired.&#xD;
6"She's living in New York, with the Mumbies.&#xD;
You must certainly pay her a visit, and renew&#xD;

his paper-mill, and has retired from business."&#xD;
An hour or more of such conversation and&#xD;
Mark withdrew, to find himself again in his little&#xD;
bedroom. Nothing was disturbed. There was&#xD;
his bookcase with its narrow desk, where he had&#xD;
passed so many hours in brain-racking devotions&#xD;
to the immortal Nine ; and as he glanced over&#xD;
the turgid lines of some uncompleted poem in the&#xD;
portfolio, his smile justified the belief that time&#xD;
brought its own severe criticism to poetasters'&#xD;
There lay in their accustomed places his guitar&#xD;
and zithern, and over his bed-head hung, as of&#xD;
yore, the engraving of Carlo Dolce's waterr Dolo-&#xD;
rosa, whose exquisite mouth and chin were but&#xD;
counterparts of Edna's. It was so natural to lie&#xD;
in the bed where he had slept since childhood;&#xD;
and he seemed to breathe such an atmosphere of&#xD;
peace and quietude, that the tremendous events&#xD;
he had passed through during three years, seemed&#xD;
like a hiatus in his life, or a dream. Did the&#xD;
war exist?  Here, all was tranquillity undis~&#xD;
turbed by alarms ; but away on the banks of the&#xD;
Appomattox his brethren in arms slept in sus-&#xD;

Ii&#xD;
&#xD;
pense; the vigilant picket watched the wily foe;&#xD;
the bursting shell tore the limbs of some sleeping&#xD;
soldier, and starving conscripts, in butternut rags,&#xD;
were flying from the rebel trenches to hospitable&#xD;
imprisonment within the Union   lines.  Such&#xD;
thoughts filled Mark's mind as he tossed uneasily&#xD;
on his downy couch and soft fringed pillow,&#xD;
until, to court slumber, he was obliged to wrap&#xD;
himself in a blanket, and seek repose on the hard&#xD;
floor.&#xD;
The next morning, in his impatience to see Edna,&#xD;
he would have started at once for the metropolis,&#xD;
but there were his old associates at the Works,&#xD;
who could not be neglected. He went there, and&#xD;
shook hands with them all, from Knatchbull to&#xD;
the youngest apprentice. How they all crowded&#xD;
around and questioned him, and seemed to be as&#xD;
much interested in him as if he belonged to them,&#xD;
while his brother stood by with an approving&#xD;
look, as if the colonel were entirely the product&#xD;
of his care and training. Mark found the Works&#xD;
still further enlarged; for his brother's business&#xD;
had increased prodigiously, and George, while al-&#xD;
hiding to this, did not fail to remark to the colonel,&#xD;
with a spice of malice, that if he had remained at&#xD;

of it for your sake," and seemed as indifferent as&#xD;
ever to'such favors. George then said, as a con-&#xD;
solatory offset, "Whenever you want to come&#xD;
back, you're welcome. Your old place is waiting&#xD;
for you, and it will pay you better than soldiering&#xD;
in the end."&#xD;
Then there was the visit to the Falls. No true&#xD;
Beltonian returning from a long absence. ever&#xD;
failed to pay his devoirs at that shrine. It seemed&#xD;
as if the old legend of the Indians, that the Great&#xD;
Spirit abided there, had ,perpetuated itself, and&#xD;
found believers among their white successors.&#xD;
Mark passed an hour of the fine January fore-&#xD;
noon in pleasant contemplation near the cataract.&#xD;
It was an old friend. Its roar, its crags, its&#xD;
emerald waters were familiar to him from child-&#xD;
hood, when he spent holidays around the pebbly&#xD;
shores seeking flint arrow-heads, or in older years&#xD;
&#xD;
when he resorted thither to derive inspiration and&#xD;
metaphorically court the nymphs and diyads.&#xD;
The torrent that sped on in sublime and unceas-&#xD;
ing monotone had measured his existence like&#xD;
a clepsydra.&#xD;
Mark extended his walk to the cliff-to the&#xD;
villa that had seemed to him a very palace of en-&#xD;
chantment, and around which so many blissful&#xD;
associations clustered. Here was the spot where&#xD;
he had made his first avowal of love, and he&#xD;
could almost recall the novel, delicious thrill&#xD;
with which he pressed Edna's hand to his lips.&#xD;
Now the gates were chained and locked, and'&#xD;
their lamps broken by vagrant boys; the lodge&#xD;
was tenantless; the marble basin of the fountain&#xD;
choked with dead leaves, and its spouting swans&#xD;
decapitated.; the grounds neglected, and the&#xD;
windows of the imposing structure blinded.&#xD;
How sad and deserted an aspect! How changed&#xD;
the place-once the abode of "elegant Euno-&#xD;
mia," the goddess of his dreams! He, remem-&#xD;
bered his surreptitious visit and eavesdropping&#xD;
the night of Edna's party. Where were all that&#xD;
youth and beauty now?. The sweeping wind&#xD;

&#xD;
answered with a dismal sigh. was there any 4&#xD;
omen in this?&#xD;
His reverie was cut short by the patter of&#xD;
horses' hoofs behind him. It was the four-in-&#xD;
hand of Mr. Nehemiah Gogglemush, a new-comer&#xD;
in Belton, who saluted. him with a stare. This&#xD;
man, who seemed ambitious to succeed to the&#xD;
position of the late magnifico, was the inventor&#xD;
of the world-famous "Terpsichorean Ointment,"&#xD;
a corn-salve of marvellous virtue, that had brought&#xD;
him a fortune correspondingly marvellous. He&#xD;
had purchased a site on the cliff and reared a&#xD;
gorgeous pile, all turrets, gilt Tudor-flowers and&#xD;
weathercocks, which completely overshadowed&#xD;
Mr. Mumbie's dwelling. Goggiemush seemed to&#xD;
have no end of money and actually dared to set&#xD;
up a drag, while his wife and daughters made&#xD;
shameful exhibitions of themselves in diamonds,&#xD;
point-lace,. India shawls; and deported them-&#xD;
selves generally in a way that no person in&#xD;
their station, and connected with corn-salve,&#xD;
who had any regard for public opinion, would&#xD;
venture to. Moreover, at church the Misses&#xD;
Adela and Angela Gogglemush, in all their&#xD;
odious finery, monopolized the attention of the&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
i&#xD;
,"&#xD;
'&#xD;
,&#xD;
.&#xD;
;&#xD;
&#xD;
congregation, and even the rector was reported to&#xD;
be not indifferent to the attractions of the younger&#xD;
of the two.&#xD;
Of course it was impossible for the Mumbies&#xD;
to live in constant proximity to such vulgarity,&#xD;
and especially as there was absolutely no one&#xD;
now in the place, except Judge Hull's family,&#xD;
with whom they could associate, as Mrs. Mumbie&#xD;
said, they had been forced to remove to New&#xD;
York.&#xD;
On his return Mark stopped for a moment at&#xD;
St. Jude's. The sexton wanted to show him the&#xD;
beautiful memorial windows, presented by Miss&#xD;
Heath in honor of her father and mother. Mark&#xD;
peopled the edifice with its old frequenters-with&#xD;
handsome, refined Mr. Heath, dignifiedly conde-&#xD;
scending, as if he were willing to meet his Maker&#xD;
half way; with Edna's sweet, uplifted, attentive&#xD;
profile; devout, slow-winking Mrs. Applegate,&#xD;
and in the opposite pew, pompous Mr. Mumbie,&#xD;
who occupied one corner with, such upright, un-&#xD;
varying exactitude, that he served as a sundial&#xD;
to Mark to measure the service, when the purple&#xD;
ray from a lancet-window moved over the capa-&#xD;
cious white waistcoat of the portly paper-maker.&#xD;

&#xD;
The new-comers had taken possession of that pew&#xD;
now, for Mark saw in it several richly bound oc-&#xD;
tavoprayer-books, stamped with the name Goggle-&#xD;
mush, hideous in Gothic text.&#xD;
Mark now proceeded to call on Dr. Wattletop.&#xD;
The information in regard to the latter's pecuni-&#xD;
ary condition, imparted by Mrs. Gildersleeve,&#xD;
troubled her brother-in-law, and he was anxious&#xD;
to. offer any assistance that the physician was&#xD;
likely to accept; but when the colonel, after&#xD;
much hesitation and circumlocution, hinted at&#xD;
his desire, Dr. Wattletop cut him short with a&#xD;
"Thanks-thanks, my dear boy, I'm quite easy.&#xD;
You must know that Miss Heath has requested&#xD;
me to accept, at a handsome salary, the position of&#xD;
physician-in-chief to the hospital she is erecting&#xD;
for the county. Noble girl, that-though I don't&#xD;
know after all that she's doing any more than her&#xD;
duty," he hastened to add, fearing that he might&#xD;
have been betrayed into admiration or approval&#xD;
of generosity. "The world, though, is so consti-&#xD;
tuted, so warped from all ideas of justice, that&#xD;
the mere performance of a single act of duty is&#xD;
greeted with applause. Sad commentary, that.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pokeinore is associated with me in the manage-&#xD;
ment. There was an effort made to foist this&#xD;
humbug Keene upon us. But Pokemore and I&#xD;
at once declared that we would not listen to it,&#xD;
and should consider it an insult and resign at&#xD;
once if this ignoramus and quack were attached&#xD;
in any way to the institution. We carried our&#xD;
point, of course."&#xD;
Mark reflected on this instance of inconsistency&#xD;
in the doctor.  Tolerant and unprejudiced he&#xD;
was towards every system and opinion save one-&#xD;
the one that attacked his professional judgment,&#xD;
and therefore self-love.&#xD;
The doctor had grown garrulous with age, and&#xD;
gave Mark a long and circumstantial account of&#xD;
the illness and last hours of Dagon; and then&#xD;
branched off into the exposition of some of his&#xD;
theories respecting future existence. All this was&#xD;
listened to with respectful impatience by the col-&#xD;
onel, who was eager to return home and prepare&#xD;
himself to take the afternoon train to New York.&#xD;
He was disappointed in this intention, for he&#xD;
found himself obliged to'attend a little tea-party&#xD;
that- evening, given by Mrs. Sniffen in honor of&#xD;
his return.&#xD;

THE next day Mark arrived in New York. lie&#xD;
alighted at the " Albemarle" and proceeded at&#xD;
once to make himself as presentable as his worn&#xD;
uniform would permit, and after a deal of brush-&#xD;
ing came out almost as smart-looking as a West&#xD;
Point cadet. As the time for the longed-for&#xD;
meeting neared, an unaccountable timidity seized&#xD;
him, and it required more screwing up of his&#xD;
courage to ring the door-bell of Mr. Mumble's&#xD;
house, than it would to have made him charge a&#xD;
battery. The new residence of the Mumbies was&#xD;
one of those extravagant structures that line the&#xD;
Fifth Avenue, and costly enough to be the domicil&#xD;
of a duke. Mark asked to see Miss Heath. The&#xD;
domestic who answered his ring replied that he&#xD;
did not know whether she were in or not, but&#xD;
would go and see-would the gentleman give his&#xD;
name?$&#xD;
Mark sent up a card and the servant returned&#xD;
with a "not at home."&#xD;

when would she be in?&#xD;
Servant couldn't tell--uncertain-didn't know.&#xD;
The colonel went away, found some brother&#xD;
officers at the hotel, and dined with them. Nfter-&#xD;
wards he returned to Mr. Mumbie's, but met with&#xD;
no better success ; Miss Heath was still "not at&#xD;
home." Disappointed again, Mark returned to&#xD;
his hotel and retired to his room to smoke in&#xD;
gloomy meditation and solitude. He was debat-&#xD;
ing upon the propriety of calling again that day,&#xD;
when his privacy was invaded by one of the&#xD;
officers he had dined with. Being an old comrade&#xD;
of the colonel, he burst in unceremoniously,&#xD;
"Where the devil have you been, Gildersleeve ?&#xD;
I've been looking all over for you the past two&#xD;
hours. Want to see you badly.    What's the&#xD;
matter, old boy ; you look awfully down in the&#xD;
mouth. Not sick, I hope? Here, rouse up; I've&#xD;
got an invite for you to a grand shine to-night.&#xD;
It's a big blow-out, and we'll have some fun."&#xD;
Mark drew from its envelope an engraved&#xD;
card imparting the information that the pleasure&#xD;
-of his company was requested by Mrs. Van Spuy-&#xD;
tenduyvel at No.    Madison Square, on that&#xD;
evening.&#xD;

<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7700-00000165"/>&#xD;
MARK GILDERSLEEVE,        331&#xD;
&#xD;
"What's this, major ?" inquired Mark; "Who&#xD;
is Mrs. Van Spuytenduyvel ?"&#xD;
"Don't know the Van Spuytenduyvels! Why,&#xD;
benighted boy, the Van Spuytenduyvels are one&#xD;
of the most illustrious and stupid families in the&#xD;
State, and-of the best blood of the Knickerbock-&#xD;
ers.  The wretches wallow in wealth.  Where&#xD;
stands yon costly fane was once the ancestral&#xD;
cabbage plantation of the Van Spuytenduyvels.&#xD;
However, that's neither here nor there. The&#xD;
lady is an old friend of mine, and that's enough.&#xD;
Met her a while ago-mentioned you-told her&#xD;
you were a good-looking boy, battle-scarred, and&#xD;
all that sort o' thing ; and she said, bring him&#xD;
along, by all means, and made tne promise be-&#xD;
sides. So don't look so bored; go you must."&#xD;
"Go, nonsense!  Why should I go?" said&#xD;
Mark, in no mood for trifling. "I don't know&#xD;
this lady."&#xD;
"I told you that I had recorded a solemn vow&#xD;
to bring you, and you've got to go, willy-illy,"&#xD;
said the major, imperturbably.&#xD;
"But I've no dress suit," expostulated Mark.&#xD;
" Dress suit, hear the innocent! Not any,&#xD;
&#xD;
thank you. Why, you stupid, you'd spoil all in a&#xD;
swallow-tail coat. What the deuce do you sup-&#xD;
pose Mrs. V. S. wants of you in black with a&#xD;
white choker? Haven't you sense enough to see&#xD;
that all she cares is to have the proper comple-&#xD;
ment of gilt buttons and straps in her rooms ?&#xD;
As for you, my bold soldier boy, you're no ac-&#xD;
count whatever, and she don't just care two pins&#xD;
for your valorous and gallant self ; so be sensible&#xD;
-be sensible. Brush up your spread-eagles and&#xD;
prepare; but first get sheared, for you look like&#xD;
a bushwacker with those elf-locks."&#xD;
The advice was in order, for Mark, in singular&#xD;
contrast with his former scrupulousness in that&#xD;
respect; had become rather neglectful of his per-&#xD;
sonal appearance, and his long black hair floating&#xD;
carelessly down his neck befitted the chief of a&#xD;
band of jay-hawkers better than a spruce Federal&#xD;
officer. "Bestir yourself, Gil; you haven't much&#xD;
time," added the major, as a parting injunction.&#xD;
"I'll call for you at ten."&#xD;
Ten o'clock came, and with it the major, who&#xD;
found Mark still in the same attitude, unprepared,&#xD;
and ruefully refilling his pipe.&#xD;
"Now, Gildersleeve, I'll not stand this," ex-&#xD;

&#xD;
claimed the lively major.   "Go you    must.&#xD;
When I say a thing I mean it;" and in spite of&#xD;
his-remonstrances the reluctant colonel was borne&#xD;
off to the ball."&#xD;
Their carriage left them at the carpeted porch&#xD;
of a sumptuous residence fronting Madison&#xD;
Square, and a domestic directed them to an&#xD;
upper room. After a little preliminary adjust-&#xD;
ment of their toilets, they descended to the par-&#xD;
lors, to pay their respects to their host and hostess.&#xD;
The major presented .his friend the colonel&#xD;
to Mrs. Van Spuytenduyvel, a tall dame with&#xD;
massive shoulders and majestic nose, who re-&#xD;
turned the colonel's bow with becoming haughti-&#xD;
ness; and to Mr. Van Spuytenduyvel, a small&#xD;
man, ambushed in the voluminous skirts of his&#xD;
ample consort ; and then the colonel and his&#xD;
friend were permitted to pass on and mingle in&#xD;
the festal throng.  The major soon found an&#xD;
attractive acquaintance among the ladies, and&#xD;
slipped away, leaving Mark to shift for himself.&#xD;
It was the first time the colonel had ever at-&#xD;
tended a fashionable party, and the brilliancy of&#xD;
the scene and display of jewels and rich dresses&#xD;
rather dazzled him. A dull pastime, though, for&#xD;
&#xD;
lhe saw none but strange faces. He looked about&#xD;
him in the vague hope that perchance he might&#xD;
meet the one whose image occupied his thoughts;&#xD;
but apparently she was not present. As he stood&#xD;
staring with an inquisitive and rather bewildered&#xD;
expression, he attracted no little attention. - His&#xD;
three years of campaigning certainly furnished&#xD;
an example of how thoroughly not only the&#xD;
mind, but its dial the countenance becomes sub-&#xD;
dued to what the former works in. He was now&#xD;
the beau ideal of a dashing trooper: swarthy and&#xD;
sinewy as an Apache brave, with a decided chin&#xD;
and glittering eyes. The scar on his brow, too,&#xD;
neither softened his sternness nor enhanced his&#xD;
good looks, and he found himself the object of&#xD;
many stares and audible re iarks from ladies to&#xD;
their -escorts as to who he was, and whether a&#xD;
"regular " or "volunteer," until, embarrassed at&#xD;
the notice he attracted, he threaded his way to a&#xD;
corner secure from observation.&#xD;
The rooms were excessively crowded, and the&#xD;
atmosphere was heated with the numerous ligts,&#xD;
and heayy with the odors of flowers and perfumes.&#xD;
Regardless of all this, some determined dancers&#xD;
were dashing along wildly, and whirling couples&#xD;

834         MARK GILDERSLEEVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
carromed like billiard-balls. Mark, inclined to&#xD;
muse, indulged in mental criticism of the com-&#xD;
pany. What struck him most was not the&#xD;
weary, solemn mien of the elder guests, nor the&#xD;
absence of frank joyousness in the young men,&#xD;
but the- supercilious nonchalance and worldly-&#xD;
wise air of the young ladies. Here and there&#xD;
was a modest flower, but many wore expressions&#xD;
of bold self-possession, that seemed to his un-&#xD;
tutored eyes to border on effrontery. Perhaps a&#xD;
harsh judgment on the part of our captious col-&#xD;
onel, but it must be remembered that he was still&#xD;
but a child of nature, living in the ideal. His&#xD;
poetic temperament led him to indulge in such&#xD;
exalted fancies of the excellences of the gentler&#xD;
sex, that when taken from his dreams and placed&#xD;
face to face with the sophisticated belles of two&#xD;
seasons, he was naturally discountenanced. To&#xD;
one living outside the pale of fashionable society,&#xD;
its artificiality is painfully apparent. Presently&#xD;
the colonel's soldierly eye was attracted by the&#xD;
erect figure of a young lady, whose back was&#xD;
towards him. Her shoulders and neck were&#xD;
moulded with such perfect grace, that he was de-&#xD;
sirous to see her face, and changing his position&#xD;
&#xD;
to do so, he beheld a radiant beauty, that recalled&#xD;
a Louis Quatorze marchioness. Powdered hair&#xD;
and a patch enhanced the fairness of her com-&#xD;
plexion, while bistred lashes gave an unnatural&#xD;
brilliancy to her eyes. Her slender throat was&#xD;
encircled by a diamond necklace, whose pendent&#xD;
cross flashed from a breast of snow, that brought&#xD;
the lines on Pope's Belinda to mind. She was&#xD;
toying with a fan, and chatting with a group of&#xD;
gentlemen who were evidently admiring her, and&#xD;
her beautiful simpering countenance betrayed&#xD;
gratified vanity. Mark scrutinized her closely.&#xD;
Recollections of familiar features arose; and the&#xD;
truth flashed to him that this young person was&#xD;
Edna.&#xD;
But what a change ! Not now the sweet, modest&#xD;
rose of Belton, but an egregiously. vain and af-&#xD;
fected coquette. So thought Mark, in whose un-&#xD;
sophisticated eyes the transformation was com-&#xD;
plete and manifest. He 'watched her a few&#xD;
moments longer. One of her danglers was made&#xD;
supremely happy by being permitted to button&#xD;
her glove, while another enjoyed the bliss of&#xD;
holding her bouquet. Then a third, a tight-built&#xD;
little fellow, with closely-cropped hair accurately&#xD;

parted in the centre of his round head, a mus-&#xD;
tache of magnitude, and a crush hat in his hand,&#xD;
gallantly clasping her, led her off in the mazes&#xD;
of a waltz. It certainly was a graceful sight; but&#xD;
Mark saw, or fancied he saw, but another phase&#xD;
of affectation in Edna's posed features and down-&#xD;
cast eyes, as she glided around in evident con-&#xD;
sciousness of the admiration she excited. With&#xD;
a pang of disappointment, Mark shrank away,&#xD;
fearing to be noticed by Edna. He had an un-&#xD;
defined dread of being noticed by her there and&#xD;
then, and very soon after, had bidden adieu to&#xD;
Mrs. Van Spuytenduyvel, and left the house.&#xD;
What bitter emotions filled the heart, and what&#xD;
cynical thoughts the mind, of our impetuous hero&#xD;
that night, it would be difficult to describe. He&#xD;
imagined he had discovered the cause of Edna's&#xD;
neglect of him. She was utterly changed. Other&#xD;
thoughts occupied her mind, and other affections&#xD;
her heart, if she had either, which he was begin-&#xD;
ning in his bitterness to doubt. Should he make&#xD;
another attempt to see her ? No, he would not.&#xD;
She was unworthy of further attention. He&#xD;

should return to his duties at once, and start for&#xD;

decision before lie fell into a feverish, disturbed&#xD;
slumber towards dawn. But, as usual, the b ht&#xD;
sunlight of morning proved a sedative, and Mark&#xD;
became . disposed to be lenient. " Perhaps,"&#xD;
thought he, " I have been unjust to her. She has&#xD;
been left an orphan to the care of fashionable&#xD;
people. Could she resist-could any young girl&#xD;
resist the influences of the artificial existence that&#xD;
such people lead ? Truth is, I must confess, that&#xD;
I don't know anything about fashion or fashion-&#xD;
able people or their ways and manners. I've no&#xD;
doubt that I'm all wrong, and that her heart is all&#xD;
right-that she is as good and kind and candid as&#xD;
ever. But when I think of the dear little artless&#xD;
darling who used to coast down the Academy&#xD;
hill at Bolton with me, and laugh so ripplingly&#xD;
when she fell in a snow-bank, and that Pompa-&#xD;
dour-looking belle playing her eyes at the host of&#xD;
smirking fools around her, I feel as if I could&#xD;

stockbroker, and had all the bru9squerie of his class;&#xD;
"why, I thought everybody knew how the colonel&#xD;
got his promotion. Why, Miss Heath; he's one&#xD;
of the best known and most serviceable officers in&#xD;
the army. I heard thecommander-in-chief him-&#xD;
self speak in the highest and most complimentary&#xD;
terms of him; said he, 'That lame devil of a cav-&#xD;
alry colonel on H- 's staff is worth all-"'&#xD;
"My dear sir," interrupted Mark, blushing,&#xD;
and anxious to turn the conversation, though with&#xD;
a secret throb of pleased vanity in his inmost&#xD;
heart, "I remember you now very well. You&#xD;
came up to City Point the day after our skirmish&#xD;
with Hoke's brigade, when poor Archer was shot&#xD;
and your brother wounded."&#xD;
"To be sure I did," said Jobson; "and some of&#xD;
you fellows at headquarters-I don't say it was&#xD;
you--gave me some of the vilest whiskey, that&#xD;
nearly cut me in two. Why, Miss Heath-"&#xD;
But Miss Heath was at that moment engaged&#xD;
with the other gentleman, to whom Mark had not&#xD;
been present d. This gentleman, evidently a&#xD;
foreigner, wa seated between the two young&#xD;
ladies, whom he was entertaining with some ap-&#xD;

parently amusing conversation in a subdued&#xD;
voice. Edna, who was reclining regally in an&#xD;
arm-chair, turned her head languidly to listen&#xD;
when appealed to by Jobson.&#xD;
"Excuse me ; I believe I omitted to introduce&#xD;
you, colonel, to Count Borgia-Colonel Gilder-&#xD;
sleeve;" and the two men bowed stiffly. She&#xD;
then condescendingly addressed a few words to&#xD;
Mark: "Have you been to Belton lately? Dull,&#xD;
stupid place, isn't it ? So little society, and what&#xD;
there is is so very inferior. Have you heard about&#xD;
those ridiculous people, those nouveau riches,&#xD;
with that horrid name, who have built near Mr.&#xD;
Mumble's? 'Isn't 'it shameful that such persons&#xD;
are permitted. to intrude among respectable peo-&#xD;
ple? And they do say Mr. Abbott visits them,&#xD;
and is quite, attentive to one of the young ladies.&#xD;
Did you ever hear the like.? -Dear me, I don't&#xD;
see how any one can live there now. I do so&#xD;
pity Constance Hull. Poor thing, she makes&#xD;
such a martyr of herself, staying there all alone&#xD;
with the Judge, and he is getting so. old, and&#xD;
peevish, and cross. Her brother very seldom&#xD;
goes to Belton, I believe, but Constance will stay&#xD;
in the poky old place."&#xD;

"Perhaps she is one of those persons infortu-&#xD;
nate enough to have attachments, and who cling&#xD;
to old associations," said Mark, sarcastically.&#xD;
Edna seemingly did not heed the thrust, but&#xD;
replied carelessly:&#xD;
"I don't know really, but it must be very stu-&#xD;
pid for her."&#xD;
She spoke with an affected drawl, and drooped&#xD;
her hands from her wrists as a standing dog&#xD;
does its paws. Then turning to the Count,&#xD;
she inquired whether he had been to a cer-&#xD;
tain reception that afternoon, and who were&#xD;
there.&#xD;
Mark directed his attention to this foreigner,&#xD;
whom he already instinctively disliked. He was&#xD;
a handsome Italian of thirty-five or so, with white&#xD;
teeth gleaming between pulpy red lips partly&#xD;
hidden by a jet mustache with waxed points. He&#xD;
appeared well-bred, spoke English fluently and&#xD;
with very little foreign accent, but minced his&#xD;
words as he displayed his teeth, and smiled so in-&#xD;
sinuatingly, that Mark's disfavor was intensified&#xD;
at the sight.&#xD;
The young ladies and the Count began discuss-&#xD;

to the party at the Van Spuytenduyvels.&#xD;
" I'm sure, Miss 1Mumbie, I am right," insisted&#xD;
the Count. " It is exactly as I have.said. I did&#xD;
not dance the bouquet figure with Miss Heath;&#xD;
I recollect, with very great distinctness, indeed,&#xD;
that I was leading with the young widow lady,&#xD;
Mrs. Lovett, who has such very charming eyes,&#xD;
and Miss Heath was with-'"&#xD;
"To be sure, Ada, don't you recollect I was&#xD;
dancing with that odious little Herbert Hopper?"&#xD;
said Edna. "Whenever I go to the Pinkertons,&#xD;
I'm sure to meet him invariably, and he never&#xD;
leaves me, so that I have to endure the pleasure&#xD;
of his company the whole of the evening."&#xD;
"I wish I were in the place of that odious&#xD;
little Hopper," remarked70361 son, gallantly.&#xD;
"There are others no better," said Edna; "as&#xD;
for Herbert Hopper, I must say that he is a per-.&#xD;
fect little pest, and I do wish he wouldn't annoy,&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Say the word,. Miss Heath," said Jobson,&#xD;
" and I'll slay him."&#xD;
"O Miss," deprecated the Count, with a win-.&#xD;

When we see a parterre of beautiful flowers, do we&#xD;
not all stop and linger around the most beautiful&#xD;

words in French that caused Edna to smile with&#xD;
evident pleasure, and pout her lips coquet-&#xD;
tighly.&#xD;
Mark's feelings underwent a complete re-&#xD;

frivolous conversation with the Count. Jobson&#xD;
sprang up also to leave. " Which way, Colonel?&#xD;
Stopping at the Albemarle, ain't you? Down&#xD;
the avenue, I suppose? I'll go with you. Stop&#xD;
a minute till I look at my watch. By Jove!&#xD;
later than I thought. Ladies, much as I regret&#xD;
it, I must tear myself away. Don't grieve, and&#xD;
I'll promise to return again and heal your lacer-&#xD;
ated hearts.  'Too late I stayed, forgive the&#xD;
crime, Unheeded flew the hours, How softly falls&#xD;
the foot of time, That only treads on flowers!'&#xD;
With which elegant extract this Child of Afflic-&#xD;
tion begs to subscribe himself on the tablets of&#xD;
your hearts, ladies, as your most obedient and&#xD;
obliged good servant. Ajew-ajew! Parting is&#xD;
such sweet sorrow that I shall say-ajew, till it&#xD;
be morrow. Ha, ha, ha!"&#xD;
The jocose Jobson then bowed himself out,&#xD;
chaffed the servant in the hall who assisted him&#xD;
on with his overcoat, lit a segar, offered one to&#xD;
the impatient colonel (who was figuratively shak-&#xD;
ing the dust from his shoes on the stoop), and&#xD;
then hooking his arm in that of the disgusted&#xD;
warrior, walked along with him, chatting with a&#xD;
familiar confidence that rather surprised. his&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
companion. Mark examined this new-found&#xD;
friend with some curiosity. Jobson was a tall,&#xD;
spare man, with a good-natured sharp face, keen&#xD;
eyes, a predatory nose, and wispy whiskers. Be-&#xD;
neath his drab surtout he wore a brown velvet&#xD;
coat and waistcoat, and his slender legs were en-&#xD;
cased in cords. A coral splinter-bar pin orna-&#xD;
mnented his blue bird's-eye scarf, and his watch-&#xD;
chain was composed of miniature snafile-bits enA-t&#xD;
ing in a horse-shoe locket. Altogether he looked&#xD;
the amateur turfman to perfection.&#xD;
" Deuced fine girl, Miss Heath, ain't she?"&#xD;
he began; "Got the stamps, too-richest heiress&#xD;
in the market. Old man took his death through&#xD;
immoderate use of cold water-fell in the drink&#xD;
over in Jersey, where he owned a whole town;&#xD;
and to think now that this sallow-faced bandit&#xD;
seems to have the inside track. It's a burning&#xD;
shame, I say, that such a smoky-head lazzaroni&#xD;
should be tolerated, when good-looking chaps&#xD;
like you and I, colonel, are around and unpro-&#xD;
vided for, ain't it ? "&#xD;
The stockbroker's flippant way of treating a&#xD;
subject so near to the colonel's heart grated&#xD;
harshly on his feelings, but curiosity overcame&#xD;

his repugnance, and he inquired, "Who is this&#xD;
Italian-this Count ?"&#xD;
"I'll tell you all I know about him in a few&#xD;
words," continued Jobson. "Throw away that&#xD;
segar first, and take a fresh one--they're Partagas.&#xD;
You see I'm a broker-by the bye, here's my&#xD;
card, and happy to see you down town at my&#xD;
office any time you're that way, or at the club&#xD;
in the evening, whichever is most convenient.&#xD;
Well, as I was saying, I'm a broker, and last&#xD;
year after I closed out the Rock Island pool, out&#xD;
of which I cleared two hundred and forty-five&#xD;
thousand dollars, in less than ninety days, I went&#xD;
to Europe and fell in with the Mumbies, I'm a&#xD;
second cousin of old man 'Mumnbie, you must&#xD;
know, although he never discovered it until I&#xD;
was worth half a million. Anyway Bob Mum-&#xD;
bie and I went about together some, and had a&#xD;
good time. Miss, Heath, who, I suppose you&#xD;
know, is a ward of Mumbie's, was with the&#xD;
family, and this feller, this Italian, was their&#xD;
courier. After a while it came out that he was a&#xD;
count, and then they all kow-towed to him as if&#xD;
he were the Grand Mogul. When they got to&#xD;
Italy he showed them his ancestral halls, and all&#xD;
&#xD;
that sort o' thing, and sold Mumbie pictures and&#xD;
marbles enough at five prices to stock a museum,&#xD;
so that the commissions and profits he made on&#xD;
them enabled him to set up for a gentleman, and&#xD;
give up the courier business. But he still froze&#xD;
to the Mumbies, and accoinpanied them over here.&#xD;
First he made love to Ada, but when he found&#xD;
out that Miss Heath was an heiress, and ever so&#xD;
much richer, lie dropped Ada and turned his bat-&#xD;
teries on the other. Bob Mumbie was also sweet&#xD;
on Miss Heath, but when the Count appeared,&#xD;
poor Bob's pipe was out at once. Mrs. Mumbie&#xD;
is as much magnetized as any of them. She&#xD;
thinks a wonderful sight of high birth, blood,&#xD;
families, and all that sort o' thing, and wants to&#xD;
secure the Count for Ada, though I don't think&#xD;
there's much show for her now. So you see the&#xD;
feller's in clover and, begad, I think he can take his&#xD;
pick of the girls any day he wants to. Can't im-&#xD;
agine what possesses our girls to take up with&#xD;
foreign beggars, with handles to their names, when&#xD;
there's lots of their good-looking sensible coun-&#xD;
trymen to be had, with the rocks to back 'em."&#xD;
here Jobson thi'ev back the lappels of his coat&#xD;
and displayed his chest. "So it goes," he con-&#xD;

tinned with a sigh. " Some time ago French&#xD;
marquises and barons were all the rage, and now&#xD;
they're running on Italian counts and princes.&#xD;
That Count Borgia hasn't got a red cent. He's&#xD;
passing chips half the time 'round to Morrissey's.&#xD;
Hang me, if I don't think lhe's a capper, and&#xD;
that's the way he manages to live."&#xD;
Jobson evidently spoke from warmth of feeling,&#xD;
and the gist of his sentiments found an emphatic&#xD;
indorsement in Mark's breast, who, however, was&#xD;
not disposed to exchange views on the topic,&#xD;
and remained silent. By this, time they had&#xD;
reached the Union Club.&#xD;
"1Come in and dine with me?" said Jobson.&#xD;
The colonel excused himself.&#xD;
" Well, say to-morrow. I'll call for you in my&#xD;
dog-cart, and we'll take a spin down the Lane be-&#xD;
fore dinner. What do you say ?"&#xD;
The colonel thanked Jobson for his invitation,&#xD;
but said he should leave for the front that even-&#xD;
in1g.&#xD;
"Sorry, colonel, if you must go. Good-by.&#xD;
Take care of yourself."&#xD;
Mark promised to do so, and returned to his&#xD;
hotel.&#xD;
&#xD;
MARK GILDERsLEEVE-         851&#xD;
" Henceforth let every incident of my past life,&#xD;
every thought and remembrance connected with&#xD;
her, be dismissed from my mind. Let it be as&#xD;
blank. I blot out every memory of Edna Heath&#xD;
from this moment. No such being exists for me."&#xD;
Such were the colonel's resolves, as he prepared&#xD;
himself to leave. "I can very well understand&#xD;
how men become Trappists. It would take but&#xD;
little to induce me to join the order, provided&#xD;
they permitted smoking. How vain, hollow, and&#xD;
illusory are all our hopes and plans! Vanity of&#xD;
vanities," etc., etc., and he continued in the usual&#xD;
strain of jilted lovers, indulging in gloomy rhap-&#xD;
sodies as he packed his portmanteau.&#xD;
An hour later he was on his way to City Point.&#xD;
Contemporaneously, the object of his animadver-&#xD;
sions was in her room preparing for the evening's&#xD;
campaign. The hair-dresser had just left, and&#xD;
she reinained leaning pensively on her toilet-&#xD;
table. Evidently she was dissatisfied with some-&#xD;
thing, probably with herself. On reviewing the&#xD;
events of the day, and her conduct and attitude&#xD;
towards Mark, a vexing doubt would obtrude that&#xD;
she had perhaps treated him rather shabbily, at&#xD;
least ungenerously, if not unworthily. "After&#xD;

&#xD;
all," she reflected, "it is his fault. He has no&#xD;
one to blame but himself. Why did he not an-&#xD;
swer my letters? why this unaccountable silence&#xD;
on his part? Perhaps he might have explained&#xD;
it, but then, why is he so intensely haughty, and&#xD;
why does he attempt to overawe me? Am I a&#xD;
child to be chidden and rendered submissive by&#xD;
imposing airs? Still he seemed so joyful when&#xD;
he entered the room-his eyes fairly sparkled.&#xD;
But what could I do? I couldn't fly in his arms&#xD;
or appear demonstrative in the presence of the&#xD;
Count and the others. Still, I might have shown&#xD;
some cordiality. I don't see what possessed me.&#xD;
I did feel like greeting him, but something&#xD;
checked me. 0 dear! I am so weak and foolish,&#xD;
I presume nothing will do now but I must write&#xD;
a note apologizing like a little goose, and telling&#xD;
him how very sorry I am, and promising never&#xD;
to do so again. No! I won't do that, but I'll&#xD;
smooth it over with a few non-committal senten-&#xD;
ces, and he will be just as well pleased." Sitting&#xD;
down to her writing-desk, she began penning a&#xD;
formal missive, containing a half dozen white&#xD;
fibs, which, before it was completed, she impa-&#xD;
tiently tore into bits, and began another which&#xD;

met a similar fate, until at length her feelings&#xD;
found relief and satisfactory expression in the&#xD;
following:&#xD;
DEAR ,MARK:&#xD;
Do not leave in anger with me.&#xD;
EDNA.&#xD;
These few words were immediately despatched&#xD;
to the colonel, who, Edna had overheard Jobson&#xD;
say, was stopping at the " Albermarle," and strict&#xD;
injunctions. given the messenger to ascertain pos-&#xD;
itively if this were so.&#xD;
The clerk in attendance at the hotel, unaware&#xD;
that Mark had departed a short time before, re-&#xD;
plied, when questioned as to whether the colonel&#xD;
were staying there, in the affirmative; and tak-&#xD;
ing Edna's note, flung it carelessly in an appro-&#xD;
priate pigeon-hole. It lay there a day; and&#xD;
the next tenant of the room occupied by Mark&#xD;
received it, opened it without looking at the ad-&#xD;
dress, and discovering his mistake and the appar-&#xD;
ent unimportance of the epistle, unconcernedly&#xD;
threw it into the fire.&#xD;
Accidents seemingly trivial shape our des-&#xD;
tinies; and this one separated two young hearts&#xD;

&#xD;
forever, and caused a material divergence in their&#xD;
future lives.&#xD;
Edna, after sending the note, remained at home&#xD;
that evening. She had engaged to go to the&#xD;
opera; but plead indisposition, and grievously&#xD;
disappointed an admirer. She waited in expecta-&#xD;
tion of a swift acknowledgment of her petitions&#xD;
The mask had fallen. If Mark could have seen&#xD;
her now, all his bitterness would have vanished.&#xD;
Old thoughts and recollections had resumed their&#xD;
sway, and her .countenance beamed with the&#xD;
.latent tenderness of a frank, generous nature.&#xD;
It was not the tristful expression of a love-lorn&#xD;
maiden, for her girlish passion for Mark was in-&#xD;
deed gone; but there remained a sincere affection&#xD;
for her old friend and playmate. He came not,&#xD;
neither made he any sign; and Edna retired&#xD;
to her room that night disappointed, and perhaps&#xD;
a little nettled. This feeling very soon passed&#xD;
over; it lasted a day or so, and then with an,&#xD;
appeased conscience, and serene conviction that&#xD;
she had made ample amends for her frigid re-&#xD;
ception of her old lover, she continued to mingle&#xD;
in the whirl of fashionable diversions.&#xD;
Her wealth and beauty had installed her at&#xD;
&#xD;
- once as the reigning belle of the season. Suitors&#xD;
she had without number. Noticeable among&#xD;
them, besides the Italian count, were: the still&#xD;
faithful Spooner, the former dog-fancier, now the&#xD;
Rev. F. Standish Spooner, in charge of a congre-&#xD;
gation at Roxbury, that he sadly neglected to&#xD;
wait upon Miss Heath, without, however, much&#xD;
hope of success, as his ineligibility as a partner&#xD;
in the dance put him at a woful disadvantage;&#xD;
the dashing stockbroker, Jobson, whom the belle&#xD;
rather disdained, in spite of his horses and yacht,&#xD;
as unrefined and inclined to low tastes; Herbert&#xD;
hopper, a little fop, with immeasurably more&#xD;
money than brains; a pretty fellow, though, that&#xD;
scores of girls would gladly have taken up with ;&#xD;
and last though not least, Percy Brocatelle, a fa-&#xD;
mous leader of the German. Percy's means of&#xD;
livelihood were involved in mystery, and his an-&#xD;
tecedents humble: He had been a clerk at Stew-&#xD;
art's, where his gentlemanly address and good&#xD;
looks had won whim many friends and acquaint-&#xD;
ances from among the fashionable patronesses of&#xD;
that establishment. Under the auspices of the&#xD;
sagacious Sextoin Brown, he had forsaken the&#xD;
glove-counter, and made his debt as a society-&#xD;

man, gradually rising to eminence in that ar-&#xD;
duous profession. Envious swells, to be sure,&#xD;
maligned him; sons of successful pork-merchants&#xD;
and stable-keepers blackballed him and refused&#xD;
him admission to their clubs ; but Brocatelle rose&#xD;
triumphant over all these obstacles, and was&#xD;
found everywhere-that was anywhere-for who&#xD;
could so deftly tread the mazes of the German as&#xD;
he? Whose head was so round, or hair parted&#xD;
with such precision as his?  And who else com-&#xD;
bined with all this, clothes so faultless, and a&#xD;
mustache so imposing? His taste, furthermore,&#xD;
in ladies' dress-in their laces, gloves, ribbons,&#xD;
and coiffures, was unimpeachable and invaluable.&#xD;
These qualities were not to be gainsaid ; and Ed-&#xD;
na, for one, declared publicly, that she preferred&#xD;
dancing with him to any one else, and dreaded&#xD;
his criticism on her attire more than even that of&#xD;
the great Schmauder. Yet in spite of all these&#xD;
advantages, Percy could make no headway&#xD;
against the Count-the irresistible Count, sur-&#xD;
rounded with all the fascinating and terrible&#xD;
glories of the Borgia family, whose star was in&#xD;
the ascendant until a prince-a real PRINCE,&#xD;
came along. For it happened in those days that&#xD;
&#xD;
the son of a reigning monarch was making a tour&#xD;
of the States. His mother, who was, naturally&#xD;
enough, a queen, although a queen, bore as irre-&#xD;
proachable a character as any matron in her do-&#xD;
minions; and as such praiseworthy conduct on&#xD;
the part of a sovereign deserved encouragement,&#xD;
several estimable old citizens of the great me-&#xD;
tropolis deemed it their duty to manifest their&#xD;
approval of her good behavior, by giving a public&#xD;
ball to her son, out of respect for his august&#xD;
mother. This, to be sure, was but a left-handed&#xD;
compliment to the son, and when a committee of&#xD;
the reverend seignors waited on the prince to&#xD;
,tender the proposed honor he did not evince any&#xD;
lively sense of anticipated pleasure; and after&#xD;
the deputation had bowed themselves off (each&#xD;
one under the delightful delusion that lhe would&#xD;
be asked in return to drop in at the palace, in a&#xD;
friendly way, on his next visit to Europe) he&#xD;
turned to his mentor and discontentedly said,&#xD;
'iDainnit, Grey, must I go to that ball, and be&#xD;

If they'd only give me a chance to have my fling,&#xD;
and pot insist on my leading out a lot of stupid&#xD;
old dowagers, Iwouldn't mind it a bit," remarked&#xD;
H. R.H.&#xD;
Now princeling was to a certain extent justified&#xD;
in his comments, for while the mass of the people&#xD;
had an honest curiosity to see a prince, and&#xD;
rushed to look at him as they would to a unicorn&#xD;
or any other rare sight, there was a select circle&#xD;
who worshipped him as the representative of&#xD;
power and pageantry, and hoped by surrounding&#xD;
him to shine resplendently in the reflected light&#xD;
of royalty. H. R. H. was not an astute lad, btit&#xD;
he was probably sharp enough to perceive that all&#xD;
the toadying he was subjected to was due to his&#xD;
rank and trappings and not to him as an individ-&#xD;
ual. That refined snobbery called loyalty has its&#xD;
redeeming side. One can understand the devo-&#xD;
tion of a good and wise royalist to an imbecile or&#xD;
wretched monarch, because the sentiment may be&#xD;
disinterested, and would still exist were the mow.&#xD;
arch an exiled mendicant, but the courtiership of&#xD;
republicans is purely selfish and debasing. Most&#xD;
of us, like Thackeray, would jurmp out of our&#xD;
&#xD;
skins for joy at walking arm-in-arm between two&#xD;
dukes, but it is painful to reflect that we should&#xD;
hardly toss a shilling to either of them the next&#xD;
day if stripped ofatheir titles and reduced to beg-&#xD;
gary. So Mr. Mumble, who was abject in the&#xD;
presence of the prince, and readyto prostrate his&#xD;
poor old, brown wig in the dust before his royal&#xD;
highness would, in all likelihood, have but grudg&#xD;
ingly lent him a dollar had he come in the guise&#xD;
of an impecunious plebeian. But H. R. H.&#xD;
was a good-natured boy and had a part to per-&#xD;
form. So he duly attended the ball, was very&#xD;
complaisant, honored several ladies, old enough&#xD;
to be his grandmammas, with his august hand in&#xD;
the dance, and was then allowed to run at large&#xD;
among the younger beauties -present.   Miss&#xD;
Heath was among those who enjoyed the inestim-&#xD;
able privilege of being selected as his partner.&#xD;
Moreover, he graciously flirted with her in the in-&#xD;
tervals of a galop. He told her that she was a&#xD;
"stunning girl." His Royal Highness had ac-&#xD;
tually said that! Edna thrilled with pleasure.&#xD;
True he had paid the same compliment to the&#xD;
'oysters of the country and its cocktails--true he&#xD;
was plain and an awkward dancer, but then he&#xD;

was a prince-a prince of the blood-royal, what-&#xD;
ever that might be, and she, Edna Heath, in his&#xD;
princely estimation, was a stunning girl!1 Was&#xD;
there anything left to live for?  Her happiness&#xD;
was complete, but alas and alack! the prince, as&#xD;
princes often do, fluttered away like a fickle but-&#xD;
terfly, and she was left forlorn to mourn his dis-&#xD;
appearance.&#xD;
Then by degrees the Count--the wily, per-&#xD;
sistent Count-temporarily eclipsed, arose again&#xD;
and reappeared in the zenith of her favor. At&#xD;
times, when she had leisure to think amid the&#xD;
excitement of her existence, she gave a passing&#xD;
thought to Mark, but she felt absolved from any&#xD;
duty towards him. She had done all that could&#xD;
be required of her, and had gone farther to retain&#xD;
his regard than she would to any other person&#xD;
than so old a friend. It is true she had had a&#xD;
girlish fancy for him, but it was at a time when&#xD;
she was barely more than a child and inexperi-&#xD;
enced. He could not possibly presume upon that&#xD;
now, especially after the long period in which lie&#xD;
had neglected her, and when her. letters had re-&#xD;
mained uncared for. Consequently she felt en-&#xD;
tirely justified in dismissing him thenceftorth from&#xD;
&#xD;
her mind. It is not so certain but that the&#xD;
Count might have shared the same fate, had it&#xD;
not been for an occurrence that turned the scales&#xD;
in his favor.&#xD;
Mrs. Mumble, in her anxiety to secure the no-&#xD;
bleman for a s&amp;amp;1-in-law, had watched with much&#xD;
dissatisfaction his marked preference for Edua.&#xD;
This, and the heiress' continued indifference to&#xD;
her son Bob's attentions, were more than her kind,&#xD;
motherly soul could bear. After a long delay and&#xD;
patient waiting, one day Bob ventured to propose.&#xD;
Edna listenedwith an air of mingled surprise&#xD;
and merriment that rather disconcerted him, and&#xD;
declined the proffered honor. The rejected post-&#xD;
ulant, chopfallen and sullen, repaired to his&#xD;
mother and related his unsuccess. Mrs. Munibie&#xD;
could contain herself no longer. The blood of&#xD;
the Skinners was aroused, and her wrath knew no&#xD;
bounds. Rushing in unceremoniously upon the&#xD;
heiress, she overwhelmed her with vehement re-&#xD;
proaches. Edna was at first bewildered, ani re-&#xD;
coiled from the storm of anger so unaccountably&#xD;
directed at her by the usually amiable matron, who&#xD;
raged away incoherently, until at length unburth-&#xD;
ening herself, the animus of all her fury was very&#xD;

disagreeably revealed. " So, Miss, you have seen&#xD;
fit to insult us-to insult your guardian-to in-&#xD;
sult the family to whom you owe so much, by re-&#xD;
fusing my son, who was good enough to honor&#xD;
you by an offer. You hussy! how dare you&#xD;
slight my son-how dare you treat us in this way?&#xD;
This is your gratitude, is it? After all the kind-&#xD;
ness we have shown you-after all our attention&#xD;
and devotion to you. You precious, artful piece!&#xD;
to think of your eating day after day at our table,&#xD;
sitting at our board with us, looking as if butter&#xD;
wouldn't melt in your mouth, and all the while&#xD;
plotting against the happiness of our children. I&#xD;
don't see how you dare look at me! And the&#xD;
Count-this foreign adventurer whom Ada de-&#xD;
spiseg and whom you have encouraged with your&#xD;
advances-this Count has turned your silly head,&#xD;
and I'llno longer permit you to stay in this house-&#xD;
hold."&#xD;
-.Edna could listen no longer. With cheeks hot&#xD;
with indignation, and hands to her ears, she re-&#xD;
treated into an adjoining room. Mrs. Mumbie,&#xD;
left alone, took to screaming, and throwiiig herself&#xD;
on the floor, drummed away with her heels in im-&#xD;
potent ire. Edna meanwhile put on her hat and&#xD;
&#xD;
shawl, and swiftly leaving the house stood in the&#xD;
street.  She drew her veil to hide her agitated&#xD;
countenance, and debated whither she should go.&#xD;
Within a few squares dwelt an intimate friend, a&#xD;
young lady, to whom she repaired and conted&#xD;
her trouble. This done, her pent-up grief could&#xD;
no longer be contained, and she gave way to a&#xD;
long cry. She was very sorrotvfal. The Mum-&#xD;
bies had always been kind to her, and their home&#xD;
was the only one she had known since her father's&#xD;
death. This sudden severance, and Mrs. Mumbie's&#xD;
cruel attack, made her feel very lonely and mis-&#xD;
erable.&#xD;
It was not until the morrow that the Mumbie's&#xD;
discovered where their ward had taken refuge.&#xD;
By that time Mrs. Mumbie had recovered Per&#xD;
presence of mind, and felt that she had sadly&#xD;
marred her plans by her hasty and intemperate&#xD;
conduct. So Mr. Mumbie was immediately de-&#xD;
spatched with a verbal apology, and instructions&#xD;
to smooth matters and induce the heiress to return.&#xD;
Mr. Mumbie felt himself rather an incompetent&#xD;
ambassador for such a mission, still he undertook&#xD;
it with zeal having a genuine affection for the&#xD;
daughter of his old friend, and sincerely and&#xD;

deeply regretting his wife's behavior towards her.&#xD;
With what seemed to him subtle policy, he put&#xD;
on sundry tokens Edna had given him, suh as a&#xD;
seal ring, a scarf-pin, and a watch-chain which&#xD;
could not fail to open a spring of fond associa-&#xD;
tions that would greatly facilitate his task. He&#xD;
augured well from his reception, for Edna ap-&#xD;
peared much pleased to see him, and held up her&#xD;
face to be kissed. But when, after a short dis-&#xD;
quisition on the weather, and some hemming and&#xD;
hawing, he ventured to announce the object of&#xD;
his mission, and, in alluding to Mrs. Mumbie's&#xD;
"peculiar temper," said she "mustn't mind it "-&#xD;
that nobody minded her "peculiar temper "&#xD;
(which was rather a stretch of veracity), as "she&#xD;
didn't mean anything by it," and that the best&#xD;
thing Edna could do was to put on her "things "&#xD;
and go right back with him-the .young lady&#xD;
shook her head in a way that caused Mr. Mum-&#xD;
bie to lose faith in his powers of persuasion. He&#xD;
tried to appeal to her feelings. "Why, Edna, you&#xD;
can't imagine how we miss you. You know we&#xD;
are a family of strong local attachments. I my-&#xD;
self have carried this knife-this "- &#xD;

them over-the knife was gone! Consternation&#xD;
was imminent-when he suddenly recollected&#xD;
that he had, for the first time in his life, left this&#xD;
cherished companion at home. This shock, how-&#xD;
ever, disturbed his ratiocination, and he floun-&#xD;
dered on rather feebly in his plea.&#xD;
"As I was saying, Edna, we miss you awfully.&#xD;
If you had only seen us at breakfast this morning,&#xD;
you couldn't stay away a minute. We couldn't&#xD;
any of us eat hardly anything. All I took was a&#xD;
cup of tea and a roll. As for Bob, and you know&#xD;
what a hearty feeder he is, poor Bob couldn't go&#xD;
more than a couple of buckwheat cakes and a&#xD;
chop, and Ada, she just about touched an egg,&#xD;
and kept pointing with her fork at your vacant&#xD;
chair, and saying there's where she used to sit.&#xD;
Last night Will Hull called, and says he, 'Where's&#xD;
Edna?' and Ada didn't know what to say. Now&#xD;
this sort of thing won't do. You must forget&#xD;
and forgive."&#xD;
" My dear guardian," replied Edna, firmly&#xD;
"while I shall always retain the utmost respect&#xD;
and gratitude for the kindness you have invari-&#xD;
ably shown me, and shall always be very much&#xD;
pleased 'to see you, I never wish to see Mrs.&#xD;

Mumble again. I could not endure to be re-&#xD;
minded of the cruel attack I was subjected to&#xD;
from her."&#xD;
"Come-come, Edna, you must not talk in&#xD;
that strain. She didn't mean anything by it.&#xD;
I've been through it myself. It's only her pecu-&#xD;
liar way, you know."&#xD;
Edna pressed her lips tightly together, and&#xD;
shook her head, in a manner that signified a fi ed&#xD;
resolution, and disheartened her guardian.&#xD;
" Why, Edna, even l3lanche has noticed that&#xD;
you have left the house, and goes whining about,&#xD;
and as for, the canaries they are dumb and dull&#xD;
as owls," added Mr. Mumble, at a loss for argu-&#xD;
ments. But even this touching allusion to the&#xD;
sorrows of the pet Italian greyhound and the sing-&#xD;
ing-birds failed to soften the obdurate ward, and&#xD;
he was obliged to retire baffled.&#xD;
Then Ada Mumbie came and tried her powers,&#xD;
but with no better success, and Edna's determi-&#xD;
nation remained unshaken.&#xD;
She stayed at her friend's house, pending the&#xD;
arrival of Mrs. Applegate, who was spending the&#xD;
winter in a distant western city, and with whom&#xD;
she intended to reside in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
The moment was a propitios one for the&#xD;
Count. He was aware that some disagreement&#xD;
had arisen between the Mumbies and Miss Heath,&#xD;
but of the nature of it he was in total ignorance.&#xD;
His curiosity was excited. He could learn noth-&#xD;
lng from the young larly. She of course was&#xD;
silent on the subject, and he had too much tact to&#xD;
appear inquisitive, but Bob-the guileless-Bob, in&#xD;
a gush of confidence, inspired by a bottle of Bur-&#xD;
gundy at the club, imparted the story of his&#xD;
unrequited love, his declaration, and its sequel,&#xD;
to the feeling bosom of a friend, who in turn&#xD;
confided the tale to a dozen other confidential&#xD;
friends. In this way it reached the ears of the&#xD;
Count, who was not slow to perceive the great&#xD;
advantage Miss Heath's present position gave&#xD;
him in prosecuting his suit. Here was a young,&#xD;
inexperienced person, severed from life-long&#xD;
friends, and left almost alone in the world.&#xD;
Naturally she was ready to attach herself to the&#xD;
first sympathetic heart that presented itself in a&#xD;
suitable and engaging way. Craftily the Count&#xD;
played his cards. When Edna went to Philadel-&#xD;
phia to, reside with her aunt, he followed her&#xD;
there, and had the field to himself. He began by&#xD;

captivating Mrs, Applegate. She bore a strik-&#xD;
ing resemblance to his cousin the Principessa&#xD;
Baldonachi, he said; and had the port and mien&#xD;
of those noble Venetian dames, that Titian loved&#xD;
to paint. He brought her flowers and escorted&#xD;
her to church. The good lady was flattered be-&#xD;
yond measure at these unwonted attentions, and&#xD;
pronounced him the most polite gentleman she&#xD;
had ever known. At a favorable moment lie&#xD;
took occasion to confide to her, his adoration of&#xD;
her niece-that truly noble young person-for,&#xD;
while he confessed, with a certain reluctance&#xD;
that he belonged to one of the most illustrious&#xD;
houses of Europe, yet he deemed the only true&#xD;
nobility to be the nobility of the soul, such as&#xD;
Miss Heath possessed; and then, with a sigh, he&#xD;
regretted that the young lady was wealthy. lIe&#xD;
deeply deplored that. " If she were only a poor&#xD;
girl-if she were entirely destitute-how happy&#xD;
I should be. With what eager joy would I&#xD;
hasten to lay my heart, my title, my patrimony,&#xD;
everything at her feet, and beg of her to accept&#xD;
them. But now, alas! I cannot. No-no--it&#xD;
cannot be-it must not be. The world-the cen-&#xD;

But you shall be my friend, will you not? 1"&#xD;
His visible agitation and moistening eyes&#xD;
touched Mrs. Applegate, who ventured a little&#xD;
consolatory advice. The Count's sentiments and&#xD;
conduct in this manner did him great honor, she&#xD;
said, but she did not think he was called upon to&#xD;
push his disinterestedness to such extremes. For&#xD;
her part, she had always been of the opinion that&#xD;
no considerations of money should be allowed to&#xD;
interfere, where true affection existed, and the&#xD;
happiness of the parties was at stake.  The&#xD;
worthy dame already saw herself sweeping down&#xD;
the grand, staircase of the Palazzo Baldonachi,&#xD;
on the arm of her noble nephew-in-law.&#xD;
The Count thanked her a thousand times, for&#xD;
her kind words. She had lifted a load from his&#xD;
heart, he said, and raising her hand respectfully&#xD;
to his lips, the gallant Italian closed the inter-&#xD;
view.&#xD;
Having secured the aunt as an ally, the Count&#xD;
redoubled his efforts to please the niece. He sur-&#xD;
rounded her with delicate attentions. He was&#xD;
pliant, polite, deferential, and at length Edna&#xD;
yielded. What else could she do? How could&#xD;

Count Borgia and Miss Edna Heath, which,&#xD;
naturally enough, created,no little excitement&#xD;
among the numerous friends and admirers of the&#xD;
bride in the neighboring city of New York. The&#xD;
match was very frankly discussed at the clubs,&#xD;
rather unfavorably than otherwise, and Jobson&#xD;
freely offered the odds of two to one, in sums to&#xD;

strangle his wife within a year; and oddsof ten&#xD;

SooN after their marriage, the Count and&#xD;
Countess Borgia sailed for Europe. The latter,&#xD;
before leaving, found use for some of her wealth&#xD;
in liquidating her husband's debts. Not a few&#xD;
of them were incurred at the gaming-table. The&#xD;
Count was in favor of repudiating these, but as&#xD;
the holders of his obligations made application&#xD;
to his wife, she insisted upon paying them.&#xD;
The fact that he proposed to cheat his gambling&#xD;
associates shocked her far more than the knowl-&#xD;
edge that he had indulged so deeply in the vice.&#xD;
But she was destined to a series of shocks. Hav-&#xD;
ing secured the coveted prize, the Count had no&#xD;
longer any object in playing the hypocrite. His&#xD;
true character revealed itself. He was faith-&#xD;
less and tyrannous. He attempted no violence&#xD;
towards her, as Jobson had predicted, but his ac-&#xD;
rimonious temper and bursts of vicious anger, al-&#xD;
ternating with fits of feigned tenderness, of spu-&#xD;
rious fawning affection, and his utter dishonesty&#xD;

soon dissipated the little love she had for him;&#xD;
aversion succeeded, and ere the first year of their&#xD;
union had closed, separation took place.&#xD;
She lives now in Paris, consoling herself in&#xD;
the care of an infant son for the lingering bitter-&#xD;
ness resulting from disillusion, and the convic-&#xD;
tion that she was the dupe of a designing knave;&#xD;
while he spends his time between Ifombourg,&#xD;
Monaco, and other gambling resorts, squander-&#xD;
ing the handsome allowance he receives from his&#xD;
wife on condition of never appearing within&#xD;

Mark Gildersleeve, at the close of the war, ap-&#xD;
plied for and received a commission, as captain&#xD;
in the regular service. The Government, when&#xD;
granting it, were pleased to convey their appreci-&#xD;
ation of the efficient and invaluable services lie&#xD;
had rendered.&#xD;
While in Washington, shortly after the receipt&#xD;
of his commission, he met at Willard's, Miss Hull,&#xD;
who had accompanied her grandfather, the Judge,&#xD;
to the capital. Mark had never been intimate&#xD;
with her, but ventured nevertheless to accost her&#xD;
and renew the acquaintance. She received him&#xD;

pleasantly, and he spent several very agreeable&#xD;
evenings in her society. She was not a comely&#xD;
young woman, rather plain, in fact-small, pale,&#xD;
and wearing shell-glasses, but she possessed a fund&#xD;
of good sense and a cultivated mind that were&#xD;
very engaging. Mark discovered that, and found&#xD;
that his wounded heart was now healing, so fast,&#xD;
indeed, that it rather amazed him. "Strange,"&#xD;
thought he, "I never noticed how much there was&#xD;
in Miss Hull. I always had an idea that she was&#xD;
a commonplace, in fact, rather insignificant girl.&#xD;
How blind boys are! Upon the whole, I think&#xD;
she's the cleverest and most charming young lady&#xD;
I ever saw; after all, how much more potent are&#xD;
the fascinations of the mind-the graces of intel-&#xD;
lect, than those of mere physical beauty."&#xD;
The sequel can be foreseen. Mark's bankrupt&#xD;
heart was now solvent. He fell in love with Con-&#xD;
stance Hull, and proposed to her. She did not&#xD;
reject him absolutely, but made her acceptance&#xD;
conditional on not being required to leave her&#xD;
grandfather. Here was a quandary. Mark was&#xD;
contented with his profession. He could not bear&#xD;
the thought of resuming his old calling, which he&#xD;
would have to do, in case he returned to live in&#xD;
&#xD;
Belton. One thing was clear: he should have to&#xD;
throw up his commission and leave the army.&#xD;
The alternative was a hard one. Resign his&#xD;
claim to Miss Hull, he could and would not. In&#xD;
this dilemma, and while seeking some way out of&#xD;
it, an event occurred which settled the matter in&#xD;
an unexpected way. Death, the great intermed-&#xD;
dler, stepped in and removed the old Judge, and&#xD;
after a proper period had elapsed, Constance Hull&#xD;
consigned her fortunes to the care of Mark Gil-&#xD;
dersleeve. The latter is now stationed at one of&#xD;
the frontier forts, and he and his wife are as&#xD;
happy as mutual affection and esteem can make&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Our ecclesiastical friend, the Reverend Spencer&#xD;
Abbott, has also taken unto himself a wife and is&#xD;
married to Miss Angela Gogglemush, second&#xD;
daughter of the distinguished inventor of the&#xD;
Terpsichorean Ointment. The wedding was the,&#xD;
most brilliant affair of the kind that ever took&#xD;
place in Belton, to quote the language of the&#xD;
"Sentinel," and was "got up in a style of Ori-&#xD;

entreaties he shook his head, and replied feebly,&#xD;
"Useless . . useless.   . .   . Nothing I say&#xD;
now can cancel one wrong I have committed or'&#xD;
any evil done. . . .  . The future cannot be&#xD;
at the mercy of chance or opportunity. .&#xD;
Justice, impartial and inexorable, of the Creator.&#xD;
How weary . . weary . . weary . . Death&#xD;
comes so slowly"&#xD;
And the old philosopher felt his own pulse as&#xD;
the current of life was ebbing fast, until like one&#xD;
going to sleep he passed away.&#xD;
The Mumbies still reside in New York. Ada&#xD;
&#xD;
is not married yet,, and Mrs. Mumbie says she&#xD;
rejoices at it when she considers the dangers to&#xD;
which eligible girls are exposed by designing&#xD;
fortune-hunters, and, as a case in point, never&#xD;
fails to cite that of Edna Heath, that "poor un-&#xD;
fortunate person," as Mrs. Mumble calls her,&#xD;
when she expatiates to a friend on the fate of her&#xD;
husband's ward, and relates how her motherly&#xD;
affection was repaid by base ingratitude. "We&#xD;
did all we could," she never omits to add, "to&#xD;
warn her against the intrigues of that foreigner.&#xD;
We expostulated with her, we besought and in-&#xD;
plored her, but all in vain, and now see the re-&#xD;
suilt. I am 'told, (lowering her voice to a whis-&#xD;
per, and with a slight shiver of horror as she bends&#xD;
to the ear of the confidant)-T am told that from&#xD;
the very day they were, married he beat her, and&#xD;
on one occasion tried to poison her; she recov-&#xD;
ered from the effects of it, but her system is a&#xD;
wreck-a complete wreck, and she now drags out&#xD;
a miserable existence, and Mr. Mumbie has actu-&#xD;
ally to pay her husband money to keep him away&#xD;
from her."&#xD;

&#xD;
mayor of Belton. The town having attained the&#xD;
dignity of incorporation some two years since,&#xD;
George was chosen its- chief magistrate by his&#xD;
grateful and admiring fellow-citizens. He is in&#xD;
no way spoiled by the honor thrust upon him, but,&#xD;
if possible, is more independent than ever ; in&#xD;
fact, it would probably, to put it mildly, now re-&#xD;
quire the combined efforts of a drove of hogs on&#xD;
the Mer de Glace to exemplify his extreme inde-&#xD;
pendence. He and his wife still occupy the small&#xD;
house on Mill Street; and the latter's chief delight&#xD;
is in the periodical visits she receives from her&#xD;
brother-in-law and adopted son, Captain Mark,&#xD;
and his wife, as he never fails to spend the fur-&#xD;
-loughs accorded him in his old home and with his&#xD;
- adopted.mother,&#xD;
Our little story is ended. What will probably&#xD;
strike the reader as the most improbable incident&#xD;
in it, will be very likely the one where truth has&#xD;
been the most faithfully followed. We allude to&#xD;
the cause of Mr. Heath's death. The traveller&#xD;
who speeds over one of the railways radiating from&#xD;
the city of New York, may be attracted, when a&#xD;
&#xD;
short distance out from the suburbs, by a fine&#xD;
stone villa surrounded by beautiful grounds and&#xD;
conservatories. It was evidently designed and&#xD;
built by some one of taste and wealth. Some&#xD;
years ago, to the astonishment of all, the owner&#xD;
perished by the act of his own hand. What led&#xD;
him to it was unknown, except to a few. It was&#xD;
remorse created by the discovery that an appar-&#xD;
ently trivial act of dishonesty -on his part, long&#xD;
years gone, had caused the ruin of an innocent&#xD;
boy suspected of the offence. Moral law vindi-&#xD;
cated itself and became its own executioner.&#xD;
Before parting with the reader, it is meet that&#xD;
we should apologize for having in one instance&#xD;
decked our hero in borrowed plumage. That is,&#xD;
in attributing to him the feat of unspiking the&#xD;
siege-gun. The honor of that exploit belonged&#xD;
to John, Stray, a private in the First Regiment&#xD;
N. Y. V. E., and occurred before Fort Wagner.&#xD;
It was done precisely as narrated, and, as an act&#xD;
of nerve and cool courage under circumstances&#xD;
of extreme peril, has but few parallels in our late&#xD;
civil war.&#xD;
THE END.&#xD;
