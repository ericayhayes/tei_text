C     HARLESTON    had fallen, and English&#xD;
partisan officers were devastating South.&#xD;
Carolina with fire and sword. It was a season&#xD;
when might seemed to have achieved: a final&#xD;
victory over right. The most hopeful of the&#xD;
patriots began to despond, and to feel that their&#xD;
cause was lost forever in thatportion of the'&#xD;
country. Toryism prevailed unchecked. Peace-&#xD;
able citizens were slain without mErcy; their&#xD;
wives and daughters were insulted, and their&#xD;
"substance wasted. South -Carolina 'was liter-&#xD;
ally trodden under foot by a remorseless foe ;&#xD;
and the in arose daily upon burning homes&#xD;
and houseless fugitives. Despair was written&#xD;
upon the weaker hearts, and defiance upon the&#xD;
stronger. Many accepted royal protection, and&#xD;
as many rejected it with ineffable scorn..&#xD;
Though dark and discouraging the period,&#xD;
opposition- had not yet ceased ; a few , daring&#xD;
souls still contended for liberty and justice.&#xD;
At Williamsburg a small party of horsemen were&#xD;
&#xD;
collected. No two were dressed alike, if we&#xD;
except tl e covering for the head, there being a&#xD;
degree of uniformity in that particular-each&#xD;
wearing a round leathern cap, more substantial&#xD;
than ornamental. If there was but little sim-&#xD;
ilarity observable in the article of dress, there&#xD;
was still less to be discovered in regard to arms&#xD;
and equipments. A few had rifles; some had&#xD;
fowling-pieces, others had rude but heavy sabres&#xD;
fashioned by the 'skill of the neighboring black-&#xD;
smith; Aand there were'others who were armed&#xD;
with swords of the ordinary kind.&#xD;
[sEE ENGRAVING.]&#xD;
However shabby their apparel, and however&#xD;
indifferently they were armed, it was very cer-&#xD;
tain that they were without exception well&#xD;
mounted, and -men of high and stern determii}&#xD;
tion, whom wrong and opptession had driven   v w&#xD;
arms as a last resort. This little band of horse-&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
THE  BRIGADE.&#xD;
&#xD;
,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7615-00000003"/>&#xD;
MARION'S BRIGADE.&#xD;
&#xD;
brilliant, and whose well-earned laurels will re-&#xD;
main green through the mutations of coming&#xD;
centuries.&#xD;
The party fell into line. A man of command-&#xD;
ing figure now rode forward, and addressed the&#xD;
men. It was Colonel Horry, the friend and&#xD;
able supporter of General Marion. -&#xD;
a "Friends, neighbors, and fellow-soldiers,"&#xD;
said the colonel, " I have a proposition to make ;&#xD;
and it is this-that you hereafter be distinguish-&#xD;
ed as a body of men, Ity the name of MARION's&#xD;
i      BRIADE. As many.as are in favo   this pro;&#xD;
position, will ride three paces to the front."&#xD;
Without hesitation every horseman moved to&#xD;
the front, sand the line remained unbroken.&#xD;
Six hearty cheers were immediately given for&#xD;
General Marion and his " brigade."&#xD;
"Here comes the general," said Ben Rowan,&#xD;
a man famous for his personal strength and&#xD;
daring.&#xD;
"He's rather small in stature," remarked a&#xD;
recruit who had joined the brigade that morning.&#xD;
"He is quite large enough to unite in his&#xD;
own person great generalship, undaunted cour-&#xD;
age, and indomitable perseverance," replied a&#xD;
young man whose name was Forstall, and who&#xD;
will frequently be mentioned in the following&#xD;
pages.&#xD;
"He's all of that," added Rowan, approv-&#xD;
ngly ; "and he rides one of the best horses in&#xD;
the- State. It's my opinion that Tarleton's&#xD;
cavalry can't keepin sight of him."&#xD;
" So far as I am able to judge in the premises,&#xD;
we are all pretty wil' mounted," -said Forstall,&#xD;
glancing at his companions with evident pride.&#xD;
".So we are,'" rejoined Ben Rowan; "and-&#xD;
so we. ought to be, for the brunt of the battle&#xD;
is coming upon us. We are almost alone in&#xD;
the field."&#xD;
"Verily, I line not thesound of the trumpet,&#xD;
and,the liftingupof the spear !" exclaimed Job&#xD;
Da son, -an athletic Quaker, on the right of&#xD;
s "Then what, are yEon here for ?" asked the&#xD;
latter, quickly, and somewhat contemptuously.&#xD;
IF,% one, Itoame. hee, to fight, and I'll follow&#xD;
talioa-hearted litkp maa (pointing to Madon)&#xD;
&#xD;
as long as .I can set on a horse, and wield any&#xD;
kind of a weapon."&#xD;
"I came hither, friend Rowan," replied&#xD;
Dawson, quietly, "to prevent wanton cruelty&#xD;
and the shedding of blood.  Verily, my soul&#xD;
hateth the neighing of steeds, and the prepara-&#xD;
tions of war."&#xD;
" You'd better go home then," answered&#xD;
Rowan, gruffly.&#xD;
"Hush ! the general is going to address us,"&#xD;
said Iorstall.  Francis Marion, mounted upon&#xD;
his renowned horse, rode leisurely to the front of&#xD;
the brigade, and every eye was fixed .earnestly&#xD;
upon him.&#xD;
" Men and soldiers, I have been sent by&#xD;
General Gates to be your leader. - I shall en-&#xD;
deavor to discharge my duty ; if I fail, it will&#xD;
be because I lack ability and address, and not&#xD;
because I do not love my country as dearly as&#xD;
any other man. I have heard that you are all&#xD;
tried men and true, and I rejoice that it is so;&#xD;
for it has been and shall be my highest ambition&#xD;
to lead such against our haughty enemies. I&#xD;
have adopted for my motto, ,'Liberty or Death,'&#xD;
and I solemnly assure you that I mean to abide&#xD;
by it. I ask no man to follow me who has not&#xD;
trained all his energies to this high determina-&#xD;
tion. It is my. firm and unalterable purpose&#xD;
never to abandon the field, so long as there is&#xD;
one true soldier in South Carolina to go with&#xD;
me to battle. Our numbers are increasing hour-&#xD;
ly, and if you are brave, resolute, and prudent,&#xD;
the whole 'country shall hear of your achieve-&#xD;
ments.   Your sweethearts shall blush with&#xD;
pleasure when they hear your names spoken;&#xD;
your wives will weep pearly tears of joy and&#xD;
gratitude ; and your children in after years will&#xD;
strive to emulate your noble deeds. I feel&#xD;
within me an assurance that this brigade will&#xD;
yet become the terror of British hirelings, and a&#xD;
word. to make the tory tremble even while the&#xD;
bayonets of Cornwallis gleam over .his dastard-&#xD;
ly head.  We will surprise our foes by sudden&#xD;
sallies; we will awe them  with the exploits of&#xD;
men resolved to conquer or die ; we will appear&#xD;
to them in unexpected places; we will cut off&#xD;
communication with their different military posts;&#xD;
&#xD;
we will, in short, harass them at all times, until&#xD;
they can feel no sense of security on the soil of&#xD;
South Carolina. You are now poorly armed,&#xD;
but I will soon lead you to victory, when all&#xD;
your Wants in this respect will be supplied; and&#xD;
you shall have the pleasure of fighting them&#xD;
with their own weapons."&#xD;
The general ceased, and the brigade cheered&#xD;
him to the echo.&#xD;
"That's what I call the right;kind of talk !"&#xD;
exclaimed Ben, enthusiastically.&#xD;
"It may suit thee, friend Benjamin," re-&#xD;
torted Job Dawson, calmly.&#xD;
Rowan looked disdainfully at the Quaker, but&#xD;
did not deign to reply. '&#xD;
"The general wishes to see you," said Col-&#xD;
onel Horry, in a low voice to Dawson. "Fol-&#xD;
low me."&#xD;
Job Dawson obeyed the summons, and in a&#xD;
few minutes his gigantic figure was see tower-&#xD;
ing up beside the smaller person of the brigadier,&#xD;
at a short distance from the encampment.&#xD;
"I have been informed by one of my mnen,"&#xD;
said Marion, " that you can tell me something&#xD;
about the movements of Major Gainey, the tory&#xD;
leader, who has done so much mischief of late?&#xD;
Now what have you'to communicate on the sub-&#xD;
ject?"-&#xD;
"1As thou seest, friend Francis, I belong to&#xD;
that peculiar sect called Quakers ; a people who&#xD;
love peace, and abhor contention. Verily, I&#xD;
cannot fight with carnal weapons ; neither will&#xD;
I encourage war and cruelties ; but this much&#xD;
.I will say ; that man of Belial, whom they call&#xD;
Gainey, and who leadeth the disaffected of our&#xD;
countrymen to battle, and -vexeth this unhappy&#xD;
land not a little, is now resting from the work&#xD;
of slaughter on the banks of the Pedee, at a&#xD;
place called ' Britton's Neck.' "     ..&#xD;
Dawson paused an instant, as if to give his&#xD;
words time to have their proper effect, and then&#xD;
added in the same mild and quiet way:&#xD;
"Hence, friend Francis, I would advise thee&#xD;
to keep out of the way of that man of blood,&#xD;
. lest he should fall upon thee and smite thee&#xD;
with the edge of the sword."&#xD;
&#xD;
"   thank you," said the general, with a&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
."It was my duty to tell thee this, to prevent&#xD;
the effusion of blood," resumed Dawson.&#xD;
Marion did not reply immediately, but fixed&#xD;
his penetrating eyes searchingly upon the singa-&#xD;
lar personage before him.&#xD;
"There are men, friend Francis," continued&#xD;
Dawson, "bad enough to fall upon this Major&#xD;
Gainey in the night time, and slay him, and&#xD;
those that- are with him,:without mercy ; but I&#xD;
hope that thou art a man of peace."&#xD;
" I eight to procure peace, fried Dawson,"&#xD;
returned the general; "and I shall certainly&#xD;
surprise Major Gain'ey to-night, if it be in my&#xD;
power to do so. His enormities are but too&#xD;
well known to me ; he has filled to the brimrthe&#xD;
measure of his sins, and I will punish him if&#xD;
heaven will kindly endow my arm with accus-&#xD;
tomed strength for a few hours longer. I have&#xD;
earnestly desired an opportunity to meet that&#xD;
tory leader, and I trust my prayer is now grant-&#xD;
ed. As you appear to be well acquainted with&#xD;
the localities referred to, you must be my guide&#xD;
to the spot."&#xD;
"You forget, friend Francis, that my con-&#xD;
science protests against such proceedings," re-&#xD;
plied Dawson.&#xD;
" Your conscience is wrongly educated," an-&#xD;
swered the general.&#xD;
"I cannot comply with thy demand," said&#xD;
the Quaker.&#xD;
" Then I must use my authority," returned&#xD;
Marion, decidedly.&#xD;
" Verily, thou hast the power, and I cannot&#xD;
resist thee," rejoined Job.- " But if I go up&#xD;
with thee to battle, I can only look and see the&#xD;
slaughter go on. As I have sagd, I cannot&#xD;
fight."&#xD;
" Do as you please about fighting ; all I re-&#xD;
quire is that you will conduct me to the camp of&#xD;
Major Gainey by the shortest route. When&#xD;
there, you shall be at liberty to fight, or run&#xD;
away, just which your conscience may incline to&#xD;
dictate.",;&#xD;

The sabre was made according to the instruc-&#xD;

riment; for it was of such weight and length,&#xD;
that it seemed to rival the famous weapon used&#xD;
by Wallace himself, when he led the plaided&#xD;
warriors to battle.  We will not attempt to&#xD;
enumerate the number of gibes and jests of&#xD;

the day. Wherever he appeared' with the pon-&#xD;
derous "utensil of war," as he quaintly styled&#xD;
it, there was sure to be an outburst -of mirth,&#xD;
and a shower of ridiculous remarks ; for Ben&#xD;
Rowan did not fail to call attention to his pa-&#xD;
tient and uncomplaining friend.&#xD;
But one thing could not be overlooked or&#xD;
denied by the most facetious and fun-loving&#xD;
among the dragoons; and that was, that the&#xD;

figure of Job Dawson was a fine model of manly&#xD;

the brigade, of a pleasing countenance, and still&#xD;
young (for he was on the sunny side of thirty),&#xD;
despite all the disadvantages under which he&#xD;
labored in, other respects, his personal appear-&#xD;
ance excited admiration and some envy. All&#xD;
agreed that " it was a pity such a noble-looking&#xD;
fellow could not fight." He moved about among&#xD;
the men, apparently unconscious that he was a&#xD;
subject of ridicule. When addressed, his an-&#xD;
swers were mild, and yet characterized by quiet&#xD;
dignity ; and his calm voice never for a moment&#xD;
lost its tones-of strange gentleness. Although&#xD;
the monstrous weapon hung at his side, no war-&#xD;

as a woman's in their expression,, and a wondrous&#xD;
serenity seemed~writtga in the singular repose of&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
.    GAINEY AND -CUNNINGHAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
HERE was one in Mario'n's brigade who&#xD;
was deeply interested in the contem-&#xD;
plated movement against Major Gainey.   The&#xD;
individual referred to was Frank Forstall, a&#xD;
young than whose name has been casually men-&#xD;
tioned.  His home was on the Pedee River, not&#xD;
far from Britton's Neck ; consequently hisnear-&#xD;
est and dearest friends were there-his parents&#xD;
and his fair and gentle sister Rose.  Nor was&#xD;
this all; Ruth Strickland, a young and inter-&#xD;
esting maiden, who had awakened in his bosom&#xD;
the tenderest sentiments of friendship, resided&#xD;
in that vicinity, giving it, by her presence, an&#xD;
additional charm.&#xD;
Mr. Strickland, Ruth's father, ws at that&#xD;
time in the army of General Gates, marching&#xD;
towards Camden. Major Gainey, the notorious&#xD;
tory leader, had heard of the rare beauty and&#xD;
accomplishments of Ruth, and naturally felt a&#xD;
desire to see her; but the admiration was all&#xD;
on his side ; for she had no sympathy with his&#xD;
cause, and shrunk with horror from the rehear-&#xD;
sal of his deeds.  She knew that he was not the&#xD;
friend of liberty; that his hands were stained&#xD;
with the blood of true patriots, and she felt to-&#xD;
&#xD;
wards him all that repugnance which the virtu-&#xD;
ous instinctively feel for the vicious and un-&#xD;
principled.&#xD;
Although they had met only by accident,&#xD;
the, major had been very free in the expression&#xD;
of his admiration, and evidently desired to cul-&#xD;
tivate her acquaintance ; but Ruth treated him&#xD;
with such coldness, that he quickly perceived he&#xD;
had little or nothing to hope in that direction.&#xD;
He embraced various opportunities that chance&#xD;
threw in his way, to endeavor to convince her&#xD;
of the justness of his cause; also to excite her&#xD;
fears, and ,awe her into something like a rever-&#xD;
ence for himself and his authority.&#xD;
He succeeded in exciting her fears and in-&#xD;
creasing her aversion, but in no other respect.&#xD;
The meetings referred to, had taken place near&#xD;
Camden, while Ruth was there visiting a rela-&#xD;
tive who was only but too partial to the tory&#xD;
interest.&#xD;
This state of things was not unknown to&#xD;
Frank Forstall, and he had hoped, with Ruth,&#xD;
that her persecutions would cease after her re-&#xD;
turn home. His anxiety may in some measure&#xD;
be imagined when he heard that Gainey and his&#xD;

MARION'S BRIGADE.                15&#xD;
&#xD;
ruffianly followers were encamped at Britton's&#xD;
Neck. Who would protect Ruth Strickland&#xD;
from insult ; and who would punish the offender&#xD;
as he deserved ?&#xD;
As young Forstall reflected upon this subject,&#xD;
his fears increased, and he waited with obvious&#xD;
impatience for the time to come when the brigade&#xD;
should be put in motion. It is not necessary&#xD;
that we should give a long description of Frank&#xD;
Forstall. He was twenty years of age, bold,&#xD;
active, an1 good-looking. He had been com-&#xD;
pelled to the field by the stern necessity of the&#xD;
times..: His innate love of truth and justice had&#xD;
induced him to side with the patriots, and he&#xD;
had joined Marion's Brigade only the day be-&#xD;
fore. The reader will recognize in Forstall, a&#xD;
young man actuated by the nobl(Mmotives, im-&#xD;
patient to distinguish himself by brave and nota-&#xD;
ble deeds.&#xD;
'While the dragoons under Marion were waiting&#xD;
so anxiously for the ap reach of night, Major&#xD;
Gainey and his men w re making themselves&#xD;
quite at hoe at Britton's Neck. They were&#xD;
slaughtering the choicest b eves that they could&#xD;
find, without taking the trouble to consult own-&#xD;
ers; they plundered granaries, they entered&#xD;
peaceful dwellings, the only inmates of which&#xD;
were helpless women, and robbed them pf their&#xD;
plate, money, and watches; and when these&#xD;
were not to be obtained, contented themselves&#xD;
by depriving them of their personal ornaments,&#xD;
such as rings, chains, bracelets, etc.&#xD;
Transactions of this kind were not limited,&#xD;
however, to that particular locality; they were&#xD;
of common occurrence all over the country, and&#xD;
excited general indignation among 'the injured&#xD;
inhabitants.&#xD;
Of all the enemies, with whom the patriots&#xD;
had to contend, none were so eminently distin-&#xD;
guished for cruelty and meanness, as the tories."&#xD;
there were no atrocities of which they were no&#xD;
guilty. To despoil and slay their whig neigh-&#xD;
bors, it would seem, appeared to them a most&#xD;
agreeable employment ; consequently there ex-&#xD;
isted between the two parties feelings of ani-.&#xD;
mosity the most implacable. The royal cause&#xD;
being now in the ascendant in South Carolina,&#xD;
&#xD;
the numerous tory bands that were sweeping&#xD;
hrough the country, loved, when occasion offer-&#xD;
ed, to show their power in acts of which no hon-&#xD;
orable foe would have been guilty. Major&#xD;
Gainey revelled in plenty at Britton's Neck, at&#xD;
the expense of the inhabitants. He triumphed&#xD;
over old men and defenceless women and chil-&#xD;
dren, and he meant that they should feel that&#xD;
he could have everything as he wished.&#xD;
Perhaps we cannot show to better advantage&#xD;
the particular position of affairs at the tory&#xD;
camp, than by giving the substance of a conver-&#xD;
sation that transpired at that time between the&#xD;
major and Colonel Cunningham, an officer who&#xD;
afterwards commanded a body of tories distin-&#xD;
guished by the not very pleasing name of the&#xD;
"Bloody Scout,"* which title was be'stowed&#xD;
upon them on account of their unparalleled bar-&#xD;
barities, and of whom we shall have more to&#xD;
say as we proceed.&#xD;
"I have given orders not to have Strickland's&#xD;
house plundered," said Gainey to Cunning-&#xD;
ham.&#xD;
"On account of the pretty Ruth, no doubt ?"&#xD;
replied the latter.&#xD;
" Of course. I have just been up there."&#xD;
"What luck ?"&#xD;
"None at all. The little beauty is proud as&#xD;
a queen, and cold as an iceberg. She said if I&#xD;
had come for the purpose of plunder, the sooner&#xD;
I accomplished the business and left the prem-&#xD;
ises, the more agreeable it would be to her and&#xD;
the rest of the family. I told her I had come&#xD;
to offer her my friendship and protection ; to&#xD;
which she answered, that neither herself nor&#xD;
friends desired the friendship of a man who had&#xD;
committed so many enormities."&#xD;
"You couldn't help understanding what she&#xD;
meant, major," remarked Cunningham, with a&#xD;
sinister smile.&#xD;
"No ; there was nothing ambiguous in her&#xD;
* It was about this time that the "Bloody Scout,"&#xD;
under the notorious Colonel Cunningham, was com-&#xD;
mitting unprecedented cruelties on the inhabitants of&#xD;
Union and Spartanburg districts. This tory acted a&#xD;
prominent part also in the partisan warfare of Laurens,&#xD;
Newberry, and Edgefield districts. He was common-&#xD;
ly called "Bloody Bill Cunningham." Plundering&#xD;
and murder were his vocation, and his ruthless band&#xD;
were the terror of the counti'y.-Avmerican Revolution.&#xD;

&#xD;
speech," returned Gainey.  "With some stern&#xD;
ness I pointed towards our camp, arid beggedi&#xD;
her to remember that a more humble demeanor&#xD;
might be more compatible with her present sit&#xD;
nation. Her mother now came to the rescue;&#xD;
a very fine-looking, but a very impertinent&#xD;
woman. She assured me that South Carolina&#xD;
was not yet conquered, and though we might&#xD;
triumph for a time, our overthrow ultimately&#xD;
war  certain.  As for my 'protection,' she&#xD;
eared nothing about it ; being willing to- suffer,&#xD;
the same hardships that her neighbors did, for&#xD;
the cause of liberty; I was provoked, but gov-&#xD;
erned my temper as well as I could, resolving to&#xD;
have a sweet revenge."&#xD;
"There's a great deal of spirit in these whig&#xD;
women," observed Cunningham.&#xD;
They are worse than the men," retorted&#xD;
Gainey, with an oath. "Although they do not&#xD;
wield the sword with their own hands, they stim-&#xD;
ltlate their lovers, husbandsand sons to greater&#xD;
exertion, and thus keep the spirit of rebellion&#xD;
alive throughout the country."&#xD;
"No one has had a better opportunity than&#xD;
myself of knowing that fact," answered Cun-&#xD;
ningham. "I consider it about as lawful to&#xD;
make- war upon them as upon their husbands,&#xD;
sons and lovers. As a general thing, I am in-&#xD;
clined to show them but little mercy ; for while&#xD;
the whig women remain unsubdued, the coun-&#xD;
try can never be wholly conquered. It is true&#xD;
that we are masters now, but we are obliged to&#xD;
ride rapidly from  place to place to fight those&#xD;
whom we suppose already awed into submission.&#xD;
As for myself, I am in favor of a warfare of&#xD;
extermination. Let the sword, the halter, and&#xD;
fire do their work without a too nice regard to&#xD;
the particular circumstance of each individual&#xD;
case. ° We have hitherto done the work but&#xD;
imperfectly.  We must terrify by the prompt-&#xD;
ness and severity of our punishments."&#xD;
"I am entirely of your mode of thinking,"&#xD;
said Gainey. " But to return to Ruth Strick-&#xD;
land. I confess I admire the girl. I shall,&#xD;
envy the man who is so fortunate as to win her&#xD;
esteem."&#xD;
" Your words remind me, major, of my own&#xD;
&#xD;
- rustic beauty," replied the colonel.  "While I&#xD;
I was out yesterday with -some of our fellows col-&#xD;
lecting beeves, levying contributions on gra-&#xD;
- naries, etc., I discovered a fine dwelling, roman-&#xD;
tically situated on the banks of the river, about&#xD;
two miles above here. I galloped up to the&#xD;
house, followed by my merry men, and learned&#xD;
by inquiry, that it was owned by a Mr. Adair,&#xD;
a rank rebel. Wedismounted and as we enter-&#xD;
ed the yard, a young man rushed out and made&#xD;
a desperate attempt to escaped; but we succeed-&#xD;
ed in securing him. He was just making pre-&#xD;
parations to join the ragged fellows that (it&#xD;
seems) are collecting somewhere near Lygeh's&#xD;
Creek on the Santee. I ordered the men to&#xD;
hang him up   the spot, when a girl of about&#xD;
seventeen,  , ould judge, threw herself at my&#xD;
feet and plead most eloquently that the order&#xD;
might be revoked. . Her earnestness attracted&#xD;
my attention,, and I perceived that she was en-&#xD;
dowed by nature with a more than ordinaiy&#xD;
share of beauty.  The soft, dark blue eyes, the'&#xD;
rosy little mouth, the delicate lily of the cheeki,&#xD;
and the charming symmetry of er whole per-&#xD;
son, had more effect upon me than any sense of&#xD;
pity or mercy which I might have !been'expeet-&#xD;
ed to feel.&#xD;
"After enjoying her distress a few moments,&#xD;
I recalled my order, resolvingto spare the young&#xD;
fellow, in hopes that he might be the means of&#xD;
acquiring an influence over the fair sister.&#xD;
While this scene was transpiring, some of the&#xD;
men had entered the cellar, rather unceremoni-&#xD;
ously, rolled out a barrel of currant wine and&#xD;
were making themselves merry by generous&#xD;
potations. I commanded them to desist, and&#xD;
after complimenting Miss Adair upon her rare&#xD;
beauty, rode off without carrying away a dol-&#xD;
lar's worth of property. Young Adair is now a&#xD;
prisoner, and I expect to purchase the friend-&#xD;
ship of the party in whom I am interested, by&#xD;
sparing his life."&#xD;
"What if that should fail, colonel'?" asked&#xD;
the major, with a smile,&#xD;
" Then I will hang him !" exclaimed Cun-&#xD;
ningham, with asavage oath.&#xD;
"Youcertainly do not wish to be understood&#xD;
&#xD;
that you feel any real affection for the girl?" little glory achieved in vanquishing him. For&#xD;
continued Gainey.                          my part, I like an enemy who will fight some-&#xD;
"I mean exactly that," replied Cunningham, what before he runs away."&#xD;
decidedly.                                   "I think we had better go and hunt him up&#xD;
"You'll propose marriage to her next, I dare to-morrow, and make an example of him ; after&#xD;
say," said the major, with an ironical laugh. which we will turn our thoughts towards beatty&#xD;
'I have made up my mind totake that step, and booty,"_replied the major.&#xD;
and you cannot laugh me out of it. If she re-  Both of the tory leaders walked towards the&#xD;

of the tories. Each had lost some dear friend, the latter was visible the gigantic figure of Job&#xD;
or been despoiled in property, or both. They Dawson.&#xD;
were men of deep thought and tried energies.  "This looks like doing something," said Ben&#xD;
They had not taken the field merely because to Forstall.&#xD;
they had been    nged, and wished to make     "I believe that every one is satisfied with&#xD;
reprisals ; but th y were influenced also by the, this movement," replied te latter.  "It is&#xD;

We shall see, as we proceed, whether they   "Thou       wrong, good Benjamin,; thou&#xD;
&#xD;
should'st wish no evil to thy brethren," said&#xD;
Dawson.&#xD;
"Cowards are no brethren of mine," retort-&#xD;
ed Rowan.&#xD;
"All men are brethren, good Benjamin,".&#xD;
said Dawson, mildly.&#xD;
"Don't 'good Benjamin' me any more !"&#xD;
cried Rowan, angrily.&#xD;
"We are the children of one great lather,"&#xD;
resumed Job.&#xD;
"I don't care nothing about it," answered&#xD;
Ben, sullenly.&#xD;
"Mr. Dawson means -well, I believe," said&#xD;
Forstall, soothingly ; for he perceived that&#xD;
Rowan's temper was getting the better of his&#xD;
judgment.&#xD;
"He's a sneaking coward, and can't fight !"&#xD;
exclaimed Rowan.&#xD;
"Do you not see that he's well armed I" add-&#xD;
ed Forstall, with a smile.&#xD;
"He might as well carry a lady's penknife as&#xD;
that tremendous thing," replied Ben, pointing&#xD;
to;Daswon's weapon. " What in the name of&#xD;
common sense can he do with it ! The fact is,&#xD;
he can't do nothing with it, and don't intend to ;&#xD;
that's the long and short of it."&#xD;
"1Be calm, good Benjamin," said Dawson.&#xD;
Rowan cast a fierce look at the Quaker, and&#xD;
seemed at first inclined to strike him ; but some&#xD;
thing about Job's placid countenance appeared&#xD;
to prevent him; and he contented himself by&#xD;
saying, in an ominous voice:     -&#xD;
"I tell you not to 'good Benjamin' me any&#xD;
more!"     --&#xD;
"I love quietness and order," added Daw&#xD;
son, unmoved- "strife and discord are repug&#xD;
nant to my nature."&#xD;
"Look here, my little giant," returned Ben&#xD;
wrathfully. " The queer notion 'has entered&#xD;
my head that you must fight, conscience or n&#xD;
conscience. What say you to that,\ son of&#xD;
Anak ?" .&#xD;
"Verily, I have fallen into the hands of the&#xD;
Philistines," said ,Dawson, without -the leas&#xD;
sign of being disturbed in temper, or betraying&#xD;
any kind of emotion.&#xD;
"Do not press the matter,'b    onstratec&#xD;
Forstall.W&#xD;
&#xD;
"But I will though !" cried Rowan.  " If&#xD;
he attempts to run, I will shoot him, as true as&#xD;
my name is what it is."&#xD;
" I think you are carrying the joke too far,&#xD;
Rowan," added Forstall.&#xD;
"It's no joke at all; and everybody that&#xD;
knows me, knows that when I say a thing, I&#xD;
abide by it.' 'Ahe fact is, I hate his stupidity&#xD;
and his senseless cant about peace and all that&#xD;
kind of thing, when in these times every strong&#xD;
arm is needed."&#xD;
"Thou art heating thy blood, friend," ob-&#xD;
served Dawson.&#xD;
"Only hear him !" cried Rowan, emphati:&#xD;
ally.&#xD;
Forstall and several others laughed heartily.&#xD;
"I'm disgusted; I can't stand this no how.&#xD;
I wish the brigade would stop a little while ;&#xD;
just long enough for me to pulverize him out ofi&#xD;
his cowhide shoes; it's a duty I owe to the&#xD;
country !" said Ben, sentimentally.&#xD;
He then bent over his saddle towards Paw-&#xD;
son, and added in a suppressed, but meaning&#xD;

Forstall resold to keep his eyes on poor&#xD;
Job Dawson as much as possible, and 'hasten to&#xD;
his assistance should his conscientious scruples&#xD;
prevent him from attempting to defend himself&#xD;
Our hero felt quite sure that were he ever so,&#xD;
much disposed to fight, he could not wield the&#xD;
extraordinary weapon with which he had provi-&#xD;
ded himself. Notwithstanding all the excite-&#xD;
ment of battle, he reproached himself that he&#xD;
had not interfered to prevent Rowan from for-&#xD;
cing him into danger.-&#xD;
But it was now too late to indulge in regrets ;&#xD;
and Job for a moment was shut out from his&#xD;
sight by a cloud of smoke. Forstall had now&#xD;
enough to occupy his attention, and as he laid&#xD;
about him with all the strength and ardor which&#xD;
the justness of his cause and aspirations for&#xD;
military renown coulti .inspire, he had no time&#xD;
to look after his Quaker friend.'&#xD;
The tories fell back and made another stand,&#xD;
encouraged by their comrades who had turned&#xD;
out and rallied in the rear. At that juncture&#xD;
Forstall saw Ben Rowan in a most critical posi-&#xD;
tion, He had, in 'his impetuosity, advanced&#xD;
beyond his division, and wassurrounded by the&#xD;
enemy.&#xD;
Forstall pressed the' spurs into his- horse's&#xD;
sides, and endeavored to reach his friend; but&#xD;
the tories had rallied, and he now found lumsel'&#xD;
in an exposed and dangerous position; and h&#xD;
gave up-Ben Rowan for lost.. Glancing towards&#xD;
him a second time, he saw Job Dawson's mam&#xD;
moth horse plunging forward with irresistible&#xD;
fury, .bearing down all in his way until he Wa&#xD;
half his length in advance of Rowan.    -&#xD;
But what surprised our hero most of all wa&#xD;
to see Job Dawson grasp his tremendous sabr&#xD;
and swing it in the air as though  were but&#xD;

flimsy lath. Forstall held his breath with as-&#xD;
tonishment and expectation. He saw the pon-&#xD;
aerous weapon descend with terrible velocity,&#xD;
sweeping two of Ben's adversaries from their&#xD;
saddles. Making no pause, he dashed on and&#xD;
was obscured from view by a cloud of smoke ;&#xD;
but Eorstall plainly heard the ringing of his&#xD;
sabre as it met some opposing weapon.&#xD;
In a short time the shout of victory was&#xD;
heard from Marion's brigade. The tories threw&#xD;
down their arms and begged for quarters. Those&#xD;
who were not slain were made prisoners.&#xD;
Forstall had singled out Major Gainey, fully&#xD;
resolved to punish him for his impertinence to&#xD;
the fair Ruth Strickland ; but he had not been&#xD;
able during the brief contest to cross swords&#xD;
with him, although he had the satisfaction of&#xD;
seeing him captured by Colonel Horry. After&#xD;
the prisoners were secured, Job Dawson was&#xD;
discovered sitting by one of the tory fires, very&#xD;
thoughtful, yet very placid.&#xD;
Young Adair who had been made a prisoner&#xD;
by Cunningham, was at liberty, and standing&#xD;
near the Quaker ; and the latter's horse stood&#xD;
beside his master, as quiet, apparently, as he&#xD;
was.&#xD;
"Verily, I hate contention," said Dawson.&#xD;
"You have done yourself immortal honor l"&#xD;
exclaimed Rowan, running up to him and grasp-&#xD;
ing his hand.&#xD;
" I don't understand thee, good Benjamin,"&#xD;
replied Dawson, gently disengaging his hand.&#xD;
"You fought like Samson among the Philia-&#xD;

" Thou art mistaken, fried  . I cannot fight&#xD;

deeds of Washington, Hannibal, and other&#xD;
great leaders. Remember you are divided into&#xD;
three sections, beginning at the right. The,&#xD;
sections will now break of, and take the places&#xD;
assigned them."&#xD;
The, orders of Captain ,Hawes were imme-&#xD;
diately obeyed ; and in a few minutes only ten&#xD;
of the company occupied the plateau where they&#xD;
had exercised. Lieutenant Anderson and Ser-&#xD;
geant Davis commanded those who were con-&#xD;
cealed in. the thicket, and the captain remained&#xD;
with those left to decoy the enemy.&#xD;
While the menbf Rocky Creek are waiting&#xD;
for the approach of the stories, we will solicit the.&#xD;
rea~dr's attention for a short time to the indi-&#xD;
vidual-who had brought intelligence respecting&#xD;
the contemplated 'onslaught of the.loyalists.-&#xD;
During the captain's patriotic, and somewhat&#xD;
original speech, he had dismounted and now&#xD;
stood beside his: reekigg horse- with his arms&#xD;
laid across the pomnuel of the saddle. He was&#xD;
nearly thirtyyears.of age; apparently, lId of a&#xD;
large and sinewy fraue. - Hi face, though semie-&#xD;
whatstern in its expression,  a nevertheless;&#xD;
&#xD;
quite handsome, and calculated to prepossess&#xD;
one in his favor. It was evident, at the first&#xD;
glance, that he was a man of firmness and reso-&#xD;
lution, and well adapted to the times in which&#xD;
he lived. He was armed with pistols and a&#xD;
short carbine, and presented a very bold and&#xD;
soldier-like appearance. Without farther pre-&#xD;
liminary remarks, we will take the liberty to&#xD;
introduce him; his name was John Henderson;&#xD;
trusting that he will ultimately prove an agree-&#xD;
able acquaintance.&#xD;
"This is a dark picture in the history of&#xD;
South Carolina," he observed to the .captain.&#xD;
"I reckon you're about right, stranger,"&#xD;
replied the latter. "Satan seems to be let&#xD;
loose for a season to turn things upside down&#xD;
in these parts."_&#xD;
"We must fight, and there's no honorable-&#xD;
alternative. The sword only can decide this&#xD;
great question of right and wrong. There are&#xD;
men enough in this State to achieve a glorious&#xD;
victory, if they will only concentrate and or-&#xD;
ganize under efficient leaders. See what'Oen&#xD;
eral Marion has done within a few days; he&#xD;
has infused new- courage into the hearts of the&#xD;
people, notwithstanding the defeat of General&#xD;
Gates at Camden.",&#xD;
"'Tarnal destruction, stranger ! You.&#xD;
mean to say ,that gates has been whipped~ at&#xD;
Camden'?" exclaimed tIawes.&#xD;
"It is too true ; he has sustained a total&#xD;
defeat, and the remnant of the American army&#xD;
is flying  panic-stricken  from  the successful&#xD;
legions of Cornwallis; but Marion and Sumter&#xD;
are destined to revive the courage of the patriots&#xD;
and check British- presumption and tory out-&#xD;
rages," replied Henderson.&#xD;
"I feel as if you had given me a heavy blow&#xD;
in the region of the stomach," said Captain.&#xD;
Nick, sorrowfully.&#xD;
"Never despond, sir, while yon are able to&#xD;
bear. arms against the enemy," added Hen-&#xD;
derson.&#xD;
"Hark I" said Hawes.   "-I hear the tramp&#xD;
of horses' feet. The tories are at hand, Now,&#xD;
stranger, if you can do, as well assay, there'll&#xD;
be a chance gr you nighty soon. Fomy par,&#xD;
&#xD;
my blood begins to bile up tremendous. If my&#xD;
brave fellows take good aim, we'll pay 'em off&#xD;
for some of their old tricks and wanton cruel-&#xD;
ties."&#xD;
While Hawes was speaking, the advance of&#xD;
the tory band swept round a point into sight,&#xD;
and presently the whole party was visible.&#xD;
As soon as the advancing horsemen perceived&#xD;
the captain's little party of ten, they spurred&#xD;
forward more furiously, with loud shouts of ex-&#xD;
ultation. It was very obvious that they felt&#xD;
sure of cutting the men of Rocky Creek to pieces,&#xD;
without losing a man ; for it /seemed to them&#xD;
like sheer madness for so small a party to&#xD;
resist.&#xD;
John Henderson sprang into the saddle, and&#xD;
M&#xD;
f     Captain Hawes hurried his men from the ap-&#xD;
pkoaching enemy, at a.double quick step. When&#xD;
he had retreated about an hundred yards, he&#xD;
gave the order to "halt," and "right about&#xD;
face ;" and the parties stood boldly with, their&#xD;
front to the foe.1 e0&#xD;
" Here I mean to stay !" exclaimed the cap-&#xD;
tain, energetically,'"until some of them sad-&#xD;
dles are empty. Straighten up, my lads, and&#xD;
stand firm; and if they try to ride you down,&#xD;
ad then let 'em ride on to the pints of&#xD;
aganets, if they want'to. Here they are ;&#xD;
now we'll see what our . sin ambush '11 do."&#xD;
The tories came       onscious of danger ;&#xD;
but the bold bearing  the handful of men un-&#xD;
der Hawes caused them to abate their speed,&#xD;
when they had reached the plateau between the&#xD;
thickets. The moment was auspicious for the&#xD;
patriots ; a well-directed fire blazed from the&#xD;
ambushed Americans ; the effect was, to put&#xD;
many of the tories hors du combat, and to throw&#xD;
the rest into confusion.&#xD;
IHawes improved the time and poured in his&#xD;
fire, which effectually checked their advance.&#xD;
The voice of the leader was heard trying to&#xD;
rally the astonished tories; but they could not&#xD;
be easily rallied ; for their enemies were con-&#xD;
cealed from view, and their fears magnified their&#xD;
numbers greatly.  The tory officers shouted&#xD;
and threatened in vain; those who could do so,&#xD;
turned and fled, and the officers were obliged to&#xD;
follow their example.&#xD;
&#xD;
When once fairly in motion, their terror seem-&#xD;
ed to lend them wings, and they spurred on with-&#xD;
out regard to order, glory, or superiors, until&#xD;
they were far beyond the reach of the rifles of&#xD;
the men of Rocky Creek.&#xD;
"If your men were only mounted !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Henderson.&#xD;
"They must be mounted," replied Hawes.&#xD;
"We can never do what we want to without&#xD;
horses. I've been thinkii' on't for some time.&#xD;
horses are scarce; for the Britishers and tories&#xD;
have stolen the best ones ; but where there's a&#xD;
will there's a way. Men, catch them  animals&#xD;
that are running' about yonder, without riders."&#xD;
Several of'the loyalists were found dead,&#xD;
and half-a-dozen severely wounded. The dead&#xD;
were buried on the spot, and the wounded suit-&#xD;
ably cared for&#xD;
"They didn't make' much by that move-&#xD;
ment," said Hawes, thoughtfully; "and we are&#xD;
in duty bound to thank you for it, stranger;"&#xD;
he added, turning to Henderson. The latter&#xD;
bowed without reply, and the captain resumed,&#xD;
in a lower tone of voice:&#xD;
"That there is an informer among my men,&#xD;
I am fully convinced. The stories couldn't have&#xD;
come down upon us so sudden, and with so&#xD;
much certainty, if they hadn't been well inform-&#xD;
ed about us. We've all been oncommon secret&#xD;
in regard to our meeting's, and intentions; and&#xD;
if there hadn't been a traitor among us, things&#xD;
couldn't have leaked out so soon. If I can dis-&#xD;
cover the infamous rascal, I reckon it'll go hard&#xD;
with him !"&#xD;
"Do you suspect any one ?" asked Hender-&#xD;
son.&#xD;
" Yes," replied Hawes; "and I shall keep&#xD;
my eye on him mighty sharp. Come, stranger,&#xD;
go with us up to the settlement; I should like&#xD;
to have your advice, as you appear to be well&#xD;
acquainted with the state of the country. I&#xD;
have got a scheme in my head to provide my&#xD;
fellers with horses and arms, and, I dare say you&#xD;
are both able and willing' to assist me ; provi-&#xD;
din' you aint otherwise engaged."&#xD;
The Independent Fire Eaters were then&#xD;
faced for the settlement, and marched away.&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
THE INFORMER. KATE MARTIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
O UR next scene opens at Rocky Creek, and&#xD;
relates also to some of the actors in the&#xD;
last chapter.&#xD;
It was the dim hour of twilight. Captain&#xD;
Hawes was seated beside a man who had been&#xD;
mortally wounded in the affray of that very&#xD;
morning. The apartment which the parties oc-&#xD;
cupied was one' of those small, rough, and low&#xD;
rooms found in the cabins of the early settlers&#xD;
of a new country.&#xD;
A single candle was burning upon a side-&#xD;
board, and threw out a pale and sickly light&#xD;
which rendered the wounded person's bloodless&#xD;
face still more ghastly.&#xD;
The -expression of Captain Hawes was seri-&#xD;
ous, but not stern; yet far more dignified than&#xD;
usual.&#xD;
"The surgeon thinks there's no hope for me,"&#xD;
said'the dying tory, faintly.&#xD;
"Not in this world," replied Hawes.&#xD;
"Then I must try and make the best im-&#xD;
provement of what little time remains," added&#xD;
the tory, speaking with much difficulty.&#xD;
"I'm sorry, neighbor, that you're dyin' in a&#xD;
bad cause," said the captain, sorrowfully. "We&#xD;
&#xD;
are brethren, and citizens of one common' coun-&#xD;
try ; and if you had been called on to give up&#xD;
airthly things while fightin' side by side with&#xD;
me, I shouldn't have felt so bad about it, be-&#xD;
cause I have an idee that death under s&#xD;
cumstances wouldn't have been disg&#xD;
but glorious."&#xD;
"I begin to fee,    tpy life is approach-&#xD;
ing its close, that you  engaged in a more&#xD;
honorable oause than that in which I received&#xD;
this mortal wound,",returned the tory, sadly.&#xD;
"I haven't come here to reproach you, by&#xD;
no means whatever, friend Simpson; but there&#xD;
is one thing I want to know  before you shut&#xD;
your eyes forever on the changin' consarns of&#xD;
this present world.  Our plans have been be-&#xD;
trayed by some vile traitor, who eats-bread with&#xD;
us daily; I want to find out the name of the&#xD;
villain, and I hope you'll feel free to tell me.&#xD;
You probably can't hold out more than an hour&#xD;
or two at most, and perhaps gettin' sich a-thing&#xD;
as that off from your conscience, may kind of&#xD;
straighten you up for the change, and make you&#xD;
stand firmer, and with a bolder front, before the&#xD;
great Commander-in-chief of all the armies of&#xD;
the airth."&#xD;
&#xD;
v&#xD;
&#xD;
Simpson shuddered, and for a moment was&#xD;
sp much convulsed that he was unable to reply.&#xD;
When he became easier and calmer, he turned&#xD;
his glassy eyes towards the captain with an ex-&#xD;
pression truly mournful.&#xD;
"I know, Captain Hawes, that an informer&#xD;
and traitor is- the most despicable og all char-&#xD;
acters," he said, slowly, pausing often to recov-&#xD;
er breath and strength; " but I can foresee the&#xD;
consequences of making such a disclosure ; the&#xD;
traitor will be punished without mercy ; and&#xD;
perhaps that would be best in the end, for all&#xD;
parties. If it hadn't been for him, I should&#xD;
now be as strong and well as you are ; but he&#xD;
and others persuaded me into the fatal move--&#xD;
ment that resulted in this terrible wound which&#xD;
is bearing my body to the grave, and my im-&#xD;
mortal part to the unknown country."&#xD;
The story paused, and a sharper twinge ex-&#xD;
torted a cry of agony.&#xD;
" Ah !" he exclaimed, " these dreadful pains&#xD;
are hurrying me away ; it can't last long in this&#xD;
manner. I hope you will see me decently buri-&#xD;
ed and if you should ever meet my poor wife&#xD;
and children, say to them all you can that is&#xD;
comforting ; and tell the oldest boy when he&#xD;
gets old enough to bear arms, not to fight&#xD;
a4 ist his own country where he first drew&#xD;
breath, and from whose so ' has received food&#xD;
and drink.?'&#xD;
"Yes, I'll do it-A 'wont forget-but the&#xD;
name of the traitor-speak while you have&#xD;
-strength, for the drummer of death is beating&#xD;
the reveille to the parade ground of eternity."&#xD;
Simpson hesitated a moment, as if not quite&#xD;
decided, and then motioned for Hawes to give&#xD;
him his ear. The captain bent over the dying&#xD;
g    man eagerly, and he whispered a name.&#xD;
" It is well," said Hawes. "I reckon the&#xD;
accoutrements of your conscience will be in&#xD;
_   better order for inspection, when you answer&#xD;
the last roll-call. I am myself rather a hard,&#xD;
sinful man, and not qualified to advise a feller-&#xD;
critter in sich an emergency as this ; but I.&#xD;
. should think it would be well for you to ground-&#xD;
your arms at the feet of the Everlasting Com-&#xD;
mander, and humbly beg for quarters. I have&#xD;
&#xD;
Q&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
27&#xD;
&#xD;
hearn say that he is verymerciful and consid-&#xD;
erate like, and who knows, but even at this&#xD;
eleventh hour, you may be marched away to&#xD;
eternal rest."&#xD;
jI thank you, I'm sure, for your well-meant&#xD;
kindness," said Simpson, while a tear moisten-&#xD;
ed his dim eye. " I hadn't supposed that you&#xD;
were so kind and so manly. I hope we shall&#xD;
meet in the ranks of heaven, where all is con-&#xD;
cord and peace. As you go along, I wish you&#xD;
would be good enough to ask Elder Martin to&#xD;
step in and see me."&#xD;
" I will ; it's a good idee, for he knows bet-&#xD;
ter than I do what you will need on the long&#xD;
march," said Hawes.&#xD;
"I hope you'll forgive me, neighbor," added&#xD;
Simpson, stretching out his cold hand.&#xD;
"God knows how freely," said the captain,&#xD;
in a subdued voice. "Good-by, Simpson, till&#xD;
I jine the army above," he added.&#xD;
. " Farewell, captain. If I could recover, I&#xD;
would gladly fight under you. - Farewell, for the&#xD;
drummer of death is indeed beating the reveille,"&#xD;
said Simpson, feebly ; and a moment after&#xD;
Hawes was proceeding towards home in a very&#xD;
thoughtful mood. He met Henderson on the&#xD;
way, and the two walked away together, con-&#xD;
versing in a friendly manner until they were&#xD;
opposite the dwelling of Rev. William Martin.&#xD;
"I must call here," said the captain.&#xD;
"Come, go in with me, for Mr. Martin is a man&#xD;
of the right sort."&#xD;
"With pleasure," replied Henderson. "I&#xD;
have often heard Mr. Martin's name mention-&#xD;
ed, and I should be pleased to see a preacher&#xD;
who does not shrink from his duty in times like&#xD;
these, when one scarcely knows friend from foe-.&#xD;
the true from the false."&#xD;
"He aint by no means afeared to speak out,"&#xD;
rejoined Hawes.  "Last Sabbath he preached&#xD;
a sermon that made every patriot that heard&#xD;
him willin' to lay down his life for the cause of&#xD;
liberty."&#xD;
Hawes knocked at the door, and both were&#xD;
immediately admitted by the pastor in person.&#xD;
The former introduced Mr. Henderson, and&#xD;
they were soon on excellent terms. The min-&#xD;

&#xD;
ister was truly a manuf,sense and courage whose&#xD;
name will long be remembered by the country&#xD;
for which he labored and suffered. While he&#xD;
was engaged in an animated discussion with&#xD;
Henderson, the door was opened and a young&#xD;
lady entered the room.    Mr. Martin, with&#xD;
characteristic politeness, instantly introduced&#xD;
her to his new acequaintance as his daughter&#xD;
Kate.&#xD;
Mr. Henderson arose, bowed, and said he&#xD;
scarcely knew what; for the sudden and unex-&#xD;
pected appearance of such a female as he now&#xD;
beheld disconcerted him not a little.&#xD;
Kate Martin was exceedingly fair of face,&#xD;
and of a figure exquisitely formed for grace and&#xD;
symmetry. And when we have passed these&#xD;
encomiums upon her, we have not said all that&#xD;
the case allows of; for she possessed good sense,&#xD;
and energy of character ; two traits that serve&#xD;
greatly to enhance the charms of personal beauty.&#xD;
Kate, though gentle and modest, might also be&#xD;
called a brilliant girl; inasmuch as she was&#xD;
liberally endowed with those high qualities&#xD;
which are calculated to make every legitimate&#xD;
effort more or less brilliant.&#xD;
Mr. Henderson prolonged his visit until a&#xD;
late hour in the evening, for he felt the power&#xD;
of Kate Martin's attractions like the spell of&#xD;
some agreeable enchantment, the witchery of&#xD;
which it was not easy to shake off, and he left the&#xD;
residence of the worthy pastor, a devoted ad-&#xD;
mirer of his daughter. Her fair idea had taken&#xD;
undisputed possession of his thoughts, and he&#xD;
did not wish to dispel it, or break the soft&#xD;
charm which she had unwittingly east over his&#xD;
spirit.&#xD;
We will not in this place dilate farther upon&#xD;
the state of Mr. Henderson's feelings, but fol-&#xD;
low the course of events in the order that they&#xD;
transpired at Rocky Creek.&#xD;
Upon the following morning at an early hour&#xD;
Hawes's company was paraded. It was observed&#xD;
by all that'the captain's manner was moi-e stern&#xD;
and dignified than at the previous drill; but&#xD;
what it portended, few or none of them could&#xD;
tell.&#xD;
" We shan't go through the marchin's and&#xD;
&#xD;
firing's this mornin' in the usual manner," said&#xD;
Hawes. " There is some business to be attend.&#xD;
ed to, that can't very well be put off. I trust,&#xD;
feller-soldiers, that not one on us is afeared to&#xD;
meet an enemy in the field knowin' him to be&#xD;
an enemy ; but all on us is feared of informers&#xD;
1 and traitoss, who steal in among us to betray us&#xD;
to the merciless tories, whose way over our&#xD;
country is marked with blood and fire. Yes,&#xD;
the snake-like, creeping traitor we all despise,&#xD;
by whatever name he may be called.   Neigh-&#xD;
bors and feller-soldiers, there's one on 'em&#xD;
among us."&#xD;
Captain Hawes paused an instant, and"each&#xD;
man looked anxiously at his comrades.&#xD;
"If there's any sich chap in our ranks, let's&#xD;
find him out !" exclaimed Sergeant Davis and&#xD;
several others.&#xD;
"That's our business this' mornin'," added&#xD;
the captain.&#xD;
" who is he-who is he ?" ran from mouth&#xD;
to mouth, along the ranks.&#xD;
"That's a question that's very nateral to ask,&#xD;
feller-soldiers; but it is a question I can an-&#xD;
swer. Know the villain ; he stands here afore&#xD;
us, tremblin' with the consciousness of his guilt,"&#xD;
continued the captain.&#xD;
"Speak his name-speak his name !" oriff&#xD;
several voices. pe -&#xD;
"What ought ,to     the reward of sich a&#xD;
scoundrel, who sells his neighbors to a band of&#xD;
murdering'  ruffians ?"  asked  the  captain,&#xD;
sternly.&#xD;
"Death !" exclaimed twenty voices.&#xD;
"You are right, feller-soldiers," answered&#xD;
the captain ; " ich a wretch richly merits death,&#xD;
and before yonder bright sun is one hour older,&#xD;
he'll be summoned to that muster-ground where&#xD;
nobody can practise deception-where nobody&#xD;
can carry concealed weapons to strike at his&#xD;
feller-critter's life in the dark,,when he aint sus-&#xD;
pectin' no danger. The informer shall die."&#xD;
Again the men glanced from one to'another,&#xD;
to see whose countenance indicated guilt, or&#xD;
fear, or both.&#xD;
" I will now pronounce the traitor's name,"&#xD;
added the captain, slowly and impressively.&#xD;
&#xD;
There was a moment of silence and intense&#xD;
suspense. Every man held his breath and&#xD;
clutched his weapon more firmly.&#xD;
"Yes, I will speak his name," repeated the&#xD;
captain, with thrilling energy. He paused the&#xD;
second time, and all eyes were fixed with in-&#xD;
describable eagerness upon him.&#xD;
"(His name," added Hawes, in the same&#xD;
slow, measured voice, dwelling upon each word&#xD;
as though he never intended to quite utter it-&#xD;
"his name is Joe Sawyer!/"&#xD;
An exclamation of surprise and deep indig-&#xD;
nation arose from the ranks. The features of&#xD;
Joe Sawyer, which lad before been exceedingly&#xD;
pale, grew absolutely ghastly in their whiteness.&#xD;
.    For an instant he appeared completely paralyzed&#xD;
and rooted to the spot ; his ashy lips vainly&#xD;
essayed to form some words, and his eyes stared&#xD;
fixedly into vacancy..&#xD;
"nTake away his arms," said the captain.&#xD;
Joe Sawyer was disarmed,, and his equip-&#xD;
ments torn from him by indignant hands, before&#xD;
he had recovered from the stupor which the ter-&#xD;
rible denouement had produced. These ener-&#xD;
getic and significant movements brought back&#xD;
the faculties of speech and volition.&#xD;
He wildly protested his innocence, and ab-&#xD;
jectly entreated for mercy in the same breath.&#xD;
"I've always been true to-you, and I hate&#xD;
an informer. For heaven's sake, spare me, and&#xD;
I'll tell you all I know about the tories !" he&#xD;
exclaimed, wringing his hands, and exhibiting&#xD;
a degree of bodily fear that was truly pitiable&#xD;
and yet revolting.'&#xD;
";Bind him " said the captain, waving his&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
Instantly the order was obeyed ; although&#xD;
the culprit writhed and struggled desperately,&#xD;
and shrieked incessantly for mercy.&#xD;
"5Are we not neighbors and friends ?" he'&#xD;
exclaimed.- "Have ye no ;pity. This is mur-&#xD;
'     der-this is butchery-this ,is horrible-mercy,&#xD;
mercy!"&#xD;
"Sargeant Davis, take a file of men and&#xD;
march the traitor fifteen paces to the front,"&#xD;
added the captain, firmly.&#xD;
The struggling, despairing mortal was drag-&#xD;
ged to the position indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Joe Sawyer," added Hawes ; "your time&#xD;
has come. We are about to give you an eter-&#xD;
nal discharge from the armies of the airth.&#xD;
You know very well that you aint fit to die;&#xD;
and that a human critter wasn't never more&#xD;
onprepared for the dead march than.you are.&#xD;
But we can't help it; it isn't our fault, but&#xD;
yours. ' A crime like yours, can't be forgiven in&#xD;
this world, although I can't say but it may be&#xD;
in the next.. It's no use for you to try and git&#xD;
out of the scrape, for there isn't a man here&#xD;
that want's you to live any longer. Many of&#xD;
these men have got wives and children ; but&#xD;
yet you was villain enough to sell them, and&#xD;
their innocent ones, to an enemy that had no&#xD;
pity for helpless babes, or defenceless beauty.&#xD;
We will show you the mercy of shootin', instead&#xD;
of hangin'; which is more than we should have&#xD;
received, had your villany been successful. I&#xD;
shall now allow you about five minutes to equip&#xD;
yourself for another world. So you had beta&#xD;
ter straighten up, and make the most on't."&#xD;
The time allotted to Sawyer to make pre-&#xD;
paration for death, was spent in petitioning for&#xD;
mercy from his earthly judges, instead of asking&#xD;
it of one who does not despise the prayers of a&#xD;
contrite spirit.&#xD;
"Lieutenant Anderson," said Hawes, " take&#xD;
three or four men and load all the muskets,&#xD;
putting a blank cartridge in every other one ;&#xD;
then return them to the company indiscrimi-&#xD;
nately."&#xD;
This order was also obeyed.&#xD;
"Joe Sawyer, your time is up ; stand up like&#xD;
a man, and meet the reward of your treachery ;&#xD;
though I reckon it's difficult to show much&#xD;
courage in i bad cause. If one of my fellers&#xD;
should be taken by the tories, he wouldn't flinch&#xD;
like that ; he'd straighten right up, stand stiff on&#xD;
his pegs, toe out, jist as if he was on parade,&#xD;
and dress boldly to the front ; that's the way&#xD;
brave men knock under, when worst comes to&#xD;
worst."&#xD;
" The knave wont stand up," said Sergeant&#xD;
Davis.&#xD;
"Let hi'm kneel down, then," replied the&#xD;
captain.&#xD;

" He wont do that," rejoined the sergeant.&#xD;
" Let him sit down," said the captain.&#xD;
"He wont do that either," remarked th&#xD;
sergeant.&#xD;
"Well, let him lay on the ground, then, i&#xD;
he wants to; it wont make no'great odds," re&#xD;
turned the captain.&#xD;
"He hasn'tcourage enough to do one thing of&#xD;
the other," added the sergeant.&#xD;
"Tie him to that little sapling !" exclaime&#xD;
the captain, impatiently.&#xD;
We will not endeavor to depict the agony o&#xD;
fear that convulsed poor Sawyer,'and'made him&#xD;
continue his frantic efforts, and to cry out for&#xD;
mercy, even after he was lashed firmly to a&#xD;
tree.  Feeling that his doom was just, no man&#xD;
interfered in his behalf; not because they were&#xD;
cruel or vindictive, but because they believed&#xD;
the times demanded such an example; for it&#xD;
might deter others from the same practices, and&#xD;
thus result in incalculable good to their beloved&#xD;
country.&#xD;
The terrible tragedy was about to be brought&#xD;
to a close, when the proceedings were unex-&#xD;
pectedly interrupted. Kate Martin suddenly&#xD;
appeared, mounted upon - a fleet horse, which&#xD;
she had evidently ridden at his greatest speed.&#xD;
She reined up gracefully and fearlessly between&#xD;
the soldiers and the pleading culprit, although&#xD;
the captain had given the order to "present&#xD;
arms."&#xD;
"I have come to prevent this terrible retri-&#xD;
bution 1" she exclaimed. "I entreat that this&#xD;
unhappy man's life may be spared."&#xD;
"Do not interrupt the course of justice, Miss&#xD;
Martin," said the 'captain. "Move to the&#xD;
right."&#xD;
"No, no ! I will remain where I am," re-&#xD;
plied Kate, firmly.&#xD;
"It is necessary, Miss Martin, that this exe-&#xD;
cution should take place," added the captain.&#xD;
"I know he is guilty," returned Kate, "but&#xD;
&#xD;
in the name of mercy, and in my father's name,&#xD;
spare him."&#xD;
e    " We all respect and love you, Kate Mar-&#xD;
tin," rejoined Hawes ; but you will oblige us&#xD;
f by moving to the right.  Not one of my men&#xD;
will present a musket to fire while you remain&#xD;
there."&#xD;
r    " I add my entreaties to hers," said Mr.&#xD;
Henderson, who had been a silent spectator of&#xD;
d the exciting scene frdm the beginning.&#xD;
"Ask in your own name, Miss Martin," said&#xD;
f one of the men, in a low voice.&#xD;
. " Yes, ask in your own name," repeated&#xD;
many others.&#xD;
"" I will, I do ask in my own name, that this&#xD;
awful scene may end without the shedding of&#xD;
blood !" cried Kate, earnestly.&#xD;
"Your request is granted," replied the-cap-&#xD;
tain; "though it's altogether contrary to the&#xD;
rules and regulations of the service ; but as&#xD;
brave men, we can't find it in our hearts to re-&#xD;
sist the pleadin's of WOman, when she straight-&#xD;
ens up afore us in her beauty, and speaks on&#xD;
the side of mercy. Sargeant Davis, untie the&#xD;
prisoner, and he may hear his sentence from&#xD;
the fair lips of Kate Martin."&#xD;
"I am very grateful for this mark of esteem,"&#xD;
said Kate ; " and I thank you all sincerely:"&#xD;
Joe Sawyer, as soon as he was released, sank&#xD;
upon his knees and poured out his emotions of&#xD;
gratitude in tears, incoherent thanks, and bless-&#xD;
ings.&#xD;
"Go," exclaimed Kate, waving her white&#xD;
hand ; "go, and be an honest man; and let the&#xD;
future atone for the past."&#xD;
"Cheers for Kate Martin, the fairest of&#xD;
South'Carolinian girls !" cried Lieutenant An-&#xD;
derson, enthusiastically.&#xD;
"Three times three !" added the captain.&#xD;
The cheers were given with hearty emphasis ;&#xD;
and Kate Martin bowed and smiled bewitching-&#xD;
ly to the bold men of Rocky Creek..-&#xD;

"Captivity is far better than disgrace," said&#xD;
Mrs. Strickland.  "I should have grieved&#xD;
more deeply had he been with those who fled&#xD;
the fight."&#xD;
" Right, madam, right !" exclaimed the sur-&#xD;
geon. " Cowardice is more to be deplored than&#xD;
imprisonment, wounds, or death."&#xD;
The surgeon soon 'after took leave, and For-&#xD;
stall and Miss Strickland were again left to-&#xD;
gether. The former would have renewed the&#xD;
conversation which had been interrupted by the&#xD;
entrance of the surgeon, but he had not the&#xD;
presence of mind to do so ; he therefore en-&#xD;
deavored to comfort his fair companion by hold-&#xD;
ing out every hope of her father's release that'&#xD;
the circumstances of the case would possibly&#xD;
admit.&#xD;
" I presume," said Frank, " that this news&#xD;

should ; but I am inclined to the belief that his&#xD;

"1 any sink under the rigors of their condi-&#xD;

"I feel the truth of your last remark," re-&#xD;

from captivity;"&#xD;
"Do so, Mr. Forstall, and whether' you suc-&#xD;
ceed or not, be assured that I shall not be un-&#xD;

" I know of no peril that I would not dare&#xD;

Frank, with considerable warmth.&#xD;

"I shall have to pulverie this fellow yet,"&#xD;
said Ben 'Rowan.&#xD;
" What's the trouble now ?" asked 'rank.&#xD;
"He's a humbug I"&#xD;
" Didst thou address me, good Benjamin ?"&#xD;
said Dawson.&#xD;
"Do yu hear that ?" exclaimed Ben.&#xD;
Verily, thou art irascible," added Job.&#xD;
"I shall wait you to hold my coat, hat, and&#xD;
other fixin's," continued Rowan to Frank,&#xD;
"What for ?" inquired the latter.&#xD;
"While I pulverize him."&#xD;
"I think that -will be ungrateful l; he saved&#xD;
your life," remonstrated Forstall.&#xD;
"That's.the very thing," said Rowan ; " he'&#xD;
saved my life and wont own it. I don't like&#xD;
to be fooled and have the wool pulled over my&#xD;
eyes.. There's nothing like pulverizing such&#xD;
chaps; it does 'em a monstrous sight of good ;&#xD;
it deepens their religious convictions, and keeps&#xD;
em in their place."&#xD;
" Thou art in the gall of bitternss, friend&#xD;
Benjamin," observed Dawson..&#xD;
&#xD;
"If I was a regerler saint I couldn't bear&#xD;
it," said Ben, in the tone of a person conscious&#xD;
that he was practising the sublimest forbearance.&#xD;
"And in the strong bonds of iniquity," add-&#xD;
ed Job, mildly.&#xD;
"To think that such a humbug should dare to&#xD;
safe my life ! it makes me mad enough to eat&#xD;
my own sabre," continued Ben, sentimentally.&#xD;
Passing over the details of Bert Rowan's&#xD;
wranglings, and reflections against the conduct&#xD;
and character of the quiet Dawson, we will state&#xD;
that the brigade encamped at its fornier posit&#xD;
tiort on the Sante. At that place Geirral&#xD;
Mariott spent several days drilling his men,&#xD;
while many hastened to join his ranks.  One&#xD;
morning the general was infornied that a man&#xD;
from Rocky Creek wished to see him; and in a&#xD;
few moments after, Captain Nicodemus. Hawes&#xD;
was ushered into his presence.&#xD;
"I'm eap'en of the Independent Fire Eaters,"&#xD;
said Hawes.   I'te hearts of your gallant ex-&#xD;

" Just such fellows as I want !" exclaimed&#xD;
the general, with a smile. " How many have&#xD;
you brought ?"&#xD;
"We number about thirty-five now, more&#xD;
nor less, big and little, great and small, take&#xD;
'em as they stand, on an average," said Cap-&#xD;
tain Nick.&#xD;
" You think they're made of the right kind&#xD;
of material ?" remarked Marion, musingly.&#xD;
"Warrant 'em to whip in all cases," rejoin-&#xD;
ed Hawes, laconically.&#xD;
Right, sir, right !"  said the  general.&#xD;
"Are they mounted ?"&#xD;
"None to speak on ; because horses are&#xD;
mighty scarce up our way ; but we can soon&#xD;
take some away from the Britishers, general;&#xD;
for as I said afore, we're onspeakable at a rough&#xD;
and tumble tussle. I've got 'em straightened&#xD;
up in line jest out yonder, and if you'll step&#xD;
out, I'll put 'em through the gamut a few times,&#xD;
to show yeu what they can do."&#xD;
To this proposition Marion assented willing-&#xD;
ly, and accompanied.Captain Hawes to the spot&#xD;
indicated.&#xD;
The Independent Fire Eaters were paraded,&#xD;
and flawes proceeded to exercise them in his&#xD;
own peculiar manner.&#xD;
"Attention the hull!  Straighten up, you&#xD;
tarnal critters.  Dress to the front, and no&#xD;
squintin'. . If any on ye haint been to break-&#xD;
fast, say so.  This man that you see here, is&#xD;
General Marion ; and, as 'you all know, he's&#xD;
arter the Britishers with a sharp stick ; and he&#xD;
means to fuller 'em like the ceaseless footsteps&#xD;
of everlastin' dath. He's a brave man, and&#xD;
has been, gifted with a better education, and&#xD;
can make a smarter speech,.perhaps, than I can ;1&#xD;
but I can feel in my heart all that he 'knows&#xD;
to express in words; and it swells within me&#xD;
inexpressible, until it e'enamost alarms 'me for&#xD;
the safety of my nateral constitution, and threat-&#xD;
ens a uniiversal collapse'of my idees. The star&#xD;
of our liberties has ris, and shines down upon us&#xD;
today right smart; and it wont never set until&#xD;
everything has busted up that's' combustible.E&#xD;
Whoe we're heat from the field, theAi1 be a&#xD;
gineral smash in the universe, and chaos, anda&#xD;
&#xD;
other unmitigated nsances will prevail quite&#xD;
extensively. When we're put down and con-&#xD;
quered, there wont be men enough left at hum&#xD;
to call the rest to dinner. The dragon of war&#xD;
is riding' like a spread eagle through our land,&#xD;
robbin' hen-roosts and gran tries, devastating&#xD;
widows, and other branches of industry, which&#xD;
have caused our heretofore happy sie to bud&#xD;
and blossom like the roses of Lebanon."&#xD;
The captain' ..paused, a mon/cat and then'&#xD;
went on :&#xD;
"Toe out, you tarnal critters. Endeavor to&#xD;
rise with the subject, and feel that each on ye&#xD;
has enough of the real grit to. make. a dozen&#xD;
heroes, and a good dog, besides, leavin' a small&#xD;

up agin. Lieutenant Anderson will now shqve&#xD;
you  through the firin's, marchi*'s, and'&#xD;
wheelin's."&#xD;
The captain ceased, and General Marion ,ex-&#xD;
pressed himself pleased with the performances.&#xD;
"To-night," he, added, "I intend to, pr-&#xD;
prise a company of tories, under Captain Bar-&#xD;
field, who are posted not far from here, between&#xD;
us and the Pedee. If I am successful, I sall&#xD;
have horses enough to mount you all to-morrw.'&#xD;
You have heard of Cunningham's escape.Isup-t&#xD;

"Yes ; and he's collectin' men in. the neigh-&#xD;
borhood of Rocky Creek. You may depend&#xD;
on't, he means 'to do mischief," replied Hawes.&#xD;
" He cannot do more than equal. the enor-&#xD;
mities of Tarleton- and Wemyss," said the gen-&#xD;
eral.&#xD;
"Ishould like to have a hand in this Bafleld&#xD;
affair," added Captain Nick.&#xD;
&#xD;
I shall be glad to have your company, cap-&#xD;
tain, with what -men you can mount," answered'4&#xD;
SMarion.&#xD;
It is onlynecessary to add, in this place, that&#xD;
. the contemplated movement was carried into&#xD;
effect successfully. Frank Forstall took an:ac-1&#xD;
- tive part in the engagement, and attracted the&#xD;
~ articular attention of General Marion; he was&#xD;
ti promised a lieutenantey as soon as a. vacancy&#xD;
should occur.- This was very gratifying to&#xD;
Frank's laudable ambition, and he wondered'&#xD;
whether Miss Kate Strickland would feel any&#xD;
pleasure when she received the news that he had&#xD;
conducted himself in a, soldier-like and becom-&#xD;
ing manner.  Such a favorable commencement&#xD;
of his military career stimulated him to ,greater&#xD;
efforts; and' his manly bearing and straight for-&#xD;
ward deportment secured him the respect of all&#xD;
who made his acquaintance.{&#xD;
i-one watched the progress of events with&#xD;
deeper interest than Forstall. -General Marion's&#xD;
high qualities as a leader, had inspired him with&#xD;
congdence, and he looked forward with hope to&#xD;
new and more brilliant achievements.&#xD;
During the engagement with Barfield's band&#xD;
of tories, Job Dawson had again been seen to&#xD;
ride furiously into the ranks of the foe ; but he&#xD;
affirmed that his horse was unruly, 'and he'had&#xD;
been carried into danger againsthis will.&#xD;
This version of the affair, Ben Rowan would&#xD;
by no means accept ; for he stoutly and persever-&#xD;
ingly asserted that he had seen him spur his&#xD;
horse into the teeth of the enemy, overturn two&#xD;
tory horsemen, and cleave .a third with his&#xD;
huge sabre. When honest Job assured his&#xD;
somewhat choleric friend Ben, that there must&#xD;
be some illusion about what he professed to&#xD;
have witnessed, he flew at once into a violent&#xD;
passion, and if Forstall had not interfered, he&#xD;
would doubtless have proceeded to extremities,&#xD;
as he was greatly in favor of the pulverizing&#xD;
system in all cases of " humbug," and obstinacy,&#xD;
or what he chose to consider as such.&#xD;
There was evidently some mystery about the&#xD;
character of Job Dawson, which neither Frank&#xD;
Forstall nor any of his new acquaintances could&#xD;
solve. The peculiariges of the Quaker had at-&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
tracted the attention of not only the men, ,but&#xD;
of the officers; and even Marion himself regard-&#xD;
ed him with much curiosity.&#xD;
It seemed singular, to Frank, and others, that&#xD;
Dawson should linger after he. had concluded&#xD;
the ostensible object of- his appearance among&#xD;
them. If he really "hated bloodshed," why&#xD;
did he not leave the brigades as soon as he was&#xD;
at liberty to do so ?  Did he stay with thedxa-&#xD;
goons because he believed he should be safer&#xD;
with them than anywhere else? ,ad hlishorse&#xD;
borne him into the conflict against his ,wishes ?&#xD;
Had he wielded his sabre deliberately, of in a&#xD;
moment of excitement, when half demented by&#xD;
an excessive fear ?  These were 'questions which&#xD;
very few felt competent. to answer. Ben,4owan&#xD;
was the most confident of any,' in the premises,&#xD;
and was apparently fully resolved that Job&#xD;
should prove a humbug in some way'or another.&#xD;
Nor was this quite - all; he resolved, further-&#xD;
more, to, flagellate him soundly, whenever, :a&#xD;
favorable opportunity should offer. This deter-&#xD;
mination was not a passing whim, but s, fixed&#xD;
and deliberately formed purpose; for :he had&#xD;
conceived the' extraordinary idea that his honor&#xD;
required it ; but how it required it, would have&#xD;
been, perhaps, a difficult matter for Ben himself&#xD;
to explain. But Job Dawson kept on the even&#xD;
tenonof his way without appearing in any man-&#xD;
ner disturbed by what others thought or said of&#xD;
him. If there was anything about him that&#xD;
they could not understand at first, the same&#xD;
mystery hung over him  now. So the Quaker&#xD;
moved among them a continual wonder, and&#xD;
a continual subject of remark and ridicule.&#xD;
Mr. Henderson, whose name is already some-&#xD;
what familiar to the reader, had accompanied&#xD;
Captain Hawes to Marion's camp; and he was&#xD;
often observed in conversation with, Dawson ;&#xD;
the nature of'those conversations no one knew ;&#xD;
but they seemed to be confidential in character,&#xD;
so far as they could judge. When together in-&#xD;
the presence of others, it was seldom that a word&#xD;
passed between them, and they might have been,&#xD;
supposed utter strangers to each other.&#xD;
We must add, in this connection, that young&#xD;
Adair, who had been released from his danger-&#xD;

6oUS position at Britton's Neck, had joined the&#xD;
briAde:; and as' Dawson had been the most ac-&#xD;
tive in setting him at liberty, the query natural-&#xD;
lirose whether any previous acquaintance had&#xD;
eridtd between the parties. If the affirmative&#xD;
'of this was true, how long had such acquaint-&#xD;
ance existed, and nder what circumstances had&#xD;
it commented 2 'But these 'inquiries were as&#xD;
ihanswerable as the others. Frank  Forstall,&#xD;
'though well acquainted with the inhabitants in&#xD;
the vicinity of Britton's 1eek, did not remem-&#xD;
bei of ever hearing the name of Job Dawson.&#xD;
Whether theie were any persons, in that par-&#xD;
tiul&amp;amp;i section, who knew him, the sequel will&#xD;
petheas '6o*. For the present we must let&#xD;
msttets tair their course, and:follow our prin-&#xD;
eigal eharaders in the order that may seem most&#xD;
natural.&#xD;
The one engrossing idea that now occupied&#xD;
and agitated'the mind ofFprstall, was the cap-&#xD;
tivity of lfi'. Strickland. There were several&#xD;
goad reasons why he wished to achieve his lib-&#xD;
.ration.  He was an old and respected neigh-&#xD;
bo, and he (Frank) loved his handsome daugh-I&#xD;

A1&#xD;

BRIGADE.&#xD;
&#xD;
,ter. But we must not forget to state distinctly,&#xD;
that our hero was not an especial favorite with&#xD;
Mr.. Strickland ; and if the truth must be told&#xD;
in plain terms, he was _ somewhat prejudiced&#xD;
against him. Mr. Strickland's reasons for not&#xD;
liking young Forstall are unknown to us, but&#xD;
he doubtless had real or imaginary ones--most&#xD;
probably the latter. It is very certain that we&#xD;
poor human beings sometimes conceive preju-&#xD;
dices and- antipathies, without being able to de-&#xD;
fine distinctly the cause or causes-of the same ;&#xD;
but we are not disposed to say that tlis was, or&#xD;
was not the case, with Ruth's father.  Thevery&#xD;
idea that Mr." Strickland diti not feel very&#xD;
friendly towards him made our hero still more&#xD;
anxious to serve him; for he very naturally&#xD;
wished to prove that his (Strickland's) antipa&#xD;
thy (if it really amounted to antipathy) was&#xD;
entirely unfounded.&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
DIX AND KATE MARTIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
hollr           HE course of events now takes us to Rocky&#xD;
r.          LI=Creek. The news that Colonel Ferguson&#xD;
was approaching with a large body of dragoons,&#xD;
marking his footsteps with blood and fire, pro-&#xD;
duced general consternation among the inhab-&#xD;
itants (consisting mostly of females and men&#xD;
too far advanced in years to bear arms) who re-&#xD;
mained at home.&#xD;
There was quite a number at Rocky Creek&#xD;
favorable to the royal cause ;. and they resolved&#xD;
to organize and choose a leader, as- their tory&#xD;
brethren had done in adjoining towns, and dis-&#xD;
tricts. The tidings of Ferguson's proximity&#xD;
= served to quicken their zeal, and hasten their&#xD;
movements.&#xD;
A young man by the name of Dix was very&#xD;
active in the contemplated organization. Hav-I&#xD;
. ing provided himself with a list of those who&#xD;
were friendly to the royal cause, he rode up and&#xD;
down the country, inviting them to assemble at&#xD;
a designated place in the vicinage of Rocky&#xD;
Creek. The whigs who had not yet taken arms,&#xD;
or had returned to arrange their domestic affairs,&#xD;
were also sounded in regard to their constancy&#xD;
to a cause, which appeared, to most people, en-&#xD;
&#xD;
tirely lost and hopeless. Such were invited to&#xD;
join them, and threatened with severe penalties&#xD;
if they refused.&#xD;
Cyrus Dix lived not far from Rev. William&#xD;
Martin's, and knew well that he was a staunch&#xD;
patriot. The former felt an earnest desire to&#xD;
change the latter's mode of thinking, and his&#xD;
reasons for this we will speedily unfold.&#xD;
Dix was well acquainted with Kate Martin,&#xD;
knew her worth, and had felt the power of her&#xD;
dazzling beauty. He had ardently sought her&#xD;
society for many months, 'and flattered- hhinse1f&#xD;
that he had made a favorable impression.'&#xD;
It will be seen then, that Dix would -att-&#xD;
ally wish to secure Mr. Martin's esteem, which&#xD;
he felt assured he could not do, while they di4er-&#xD;
ed so widely in sentiment ; hence he improved&#xD;
every opportunity to reason most earnestly, and&#xD;
with all the power of insinuating arts, and elo-&#xD;
quence that he could possibly bring into exer-&#xD;
cise, on the subject of their differences.&#xD;
Dix was at heart.a bad man, but he took the&#xD;
best of care to disguise his true character, and&#xD;
to appear to 1Martin's eyes like one who hon-&#xD;
estly and conscientiously differed with, him in&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
opinion. While he seemed to sustain this as-&#xD;
sumed position, the good father could not find&#xD;
it in his heart to treat him otherwise than an&#xD;
honorable and high-minded, though mistaken&#xD;
young man. The day before the royalists of&#xD;
that and adjoining districts were to assemble,&#xD;
with a view to an armed and permanent organ-&#xD;
ization, Dix walked over to Mr. Martin's, in&#xD;
order to make a final effort to shake his patriot-&#xD;
ism to its foundation.&#xD;
Nor was this the sole object of his visit ;&#xD;
after he had done all that he could in that'par-&#xD;
tieuler direction, he had determined to make aI&#xD;
f0ll declaration of his sentiments to the peer-&#xD;
less Kate. We shall be obliged to give theI&#xD;
reader the purport of the conversation that en-&#xD;
sued between the pastor and Cyrus Dix.&#xD;
" I have come to converse with you once more&#xD;
on the subject of our honest differences ofopin-&#xD;
ion. I would to heaven that you could see as&#xD;
I do, in this matter," said Dix, .with much&#xD;
emphasis.,&#xD;
" I respect your friendly earnestness, young&#xD;
man," replied the pastor; "but pardon me, l&#xD;
when I say that I do thoroughly detest your&#xD;
cause. I have not only wished that you might i&#xD;
discover the errors into which you have unwit-v&#xD;
tingly'fallen, but I have prayed that our com-&#xD;
mon Father-would mercifully open your eyes, t&#xD;
and quicken your understanding."           t&#xD;
"I much regret your infatuation," returned&#xD;
Din, earnestly ; "and perhaps I might say hal- h&#xD;
lucination, instead of the milder term I have&#xD;
employed. Your sacred profession  prevents t&#xD;
you from fighting with the ordinary weapons of&#xD;
human warfare. -.You are well-known among w&#xD;
the royalists as-having incited the hitherto peace- 1&#xD;
able inhabitants to arms, and they feel justly&#xD;
indignant against you; who then will protector&#xD;
yourself, your wife and fair daughter from' the a&#xD;
vengeance of those, marauding parties who 'are n&#xD;
sweeping like lightning through the country ?" d&#xD;
"I have served the God of heaven many a&#xD;
years, and I have never yet been forsaken," sI&#xD;
replied Martin, devoutly.-                r&#xD;
" Once .more I appeal to you, sir ; will you m&#xD;
not it least, in appearance, favor the royal th&#xD;
&#xD;
cause ? Your own safety and that of your fam-&#xD;
ily require this much of you."&#xD;
" Go, young man !" exclaimed Martin, stern-&#xD;
ly. 1" You forget the respect which is due one&#xD;
so much your senior. I never was a hypocrite ;&#xD;
and the God of'battles being my helper, I never&#xD;
will be. It is useless to prolong this conver-&#xD;
sation. To persist in   such language would&#xD;
soon rob you of the respect, whichgIuave hith-&#xD;
erto entertained for you. Go, and let this sub-&#xD;
ject never be renewed between us, unless you&#xD;
are led to see the fatal error into which you&#xD;
have been led."&#xD;
" I am sorry for this," resumed Dix, art-&#xD;
fully affecting some emotion.  "I have -esteem-&#xD;
ed you highly, and earnestly wish to see you&#xD;
shielded from the evil which is surely deter-&#xD;
mined against you."&#xD;
" Blessed are they who suffer for righteous-&#xD;
ress' sake," responded Mr. Martin, fervently.&#xD;
Dix despaired (as he well might) of shaking&#xD;
the constancy of such a man as the worthy&#xD;
pastor; he accordingly sought Kate, to learn&#xD;
how matters 'stood in that direction. As it hap-&#xD;
pened, a very favorable opportunity presented&#xD;
itself, and he entered into the subject of his call&#xD;
without circumlocution..&#xD;
"I have been conversing with your father&#xD;
his morning, in regard to his unfortunate poli-&#xD;
ical sentiments," said Dix.&#xD;
" Have you succeeded in convincing him of&#xD;
is heresy ?" asked Kate, calmly.&#xD;
"I am sorry to say that I have not," was&#xD;
he reply.&#xD;
"Will you be kind enough to inform     ine&#xD;
why you regret the circumstance-?" added Miss&#xD;
Martin.&#xD;
"For several reasons, my fair neighbor,"&#xD;
ejoined Dix, blandly.-  First; because such&#xD;
worthy man should be so blinded in his judg-&#xD;
nent; second--because such sentiments en-&#xD;
anger his personal safety; third--on your own&#xD;
count ; for it naturally follows, if your father&#xD;
offers for the active part he has taken in this&#xD;
rebellion, you also will suffer by his -punish-&#xD;
ent. 1 These are among the numerous reasons&#xD;
at make me regret Mr. Martin's obstinacy."&#xD;
&#xD;
While he was speaking, Kate was quietly&#xD;
studying his character, and arriving at a veryI&#xD;
accurate conclusion in regard to the object of&#xD;
his apparently disinterested efforts.&#xD;
"Perhaps, Mr. Dix," she said, with much&#xD;
seeming simplicity of manner, "it pis in your&#xD;
power to aid us in this unhappy diletma into&#xD;
which we have fallen."&#xD;
"You speak to the point, my dear Kate,"&#xD;
added the loyalist, in tones still more confiden-&#xD;
tial and patronizing. "'This conversation, as I&#xD;
shall show, is very opportune, as far as your&#xD;
father's safety is concerned  Rocky. Creek, at&#xD;
the present time, is left entirely to the mercy of&#xD;
the royalists."&#xD;
"But are they not too noble to make war&#xD;
upon defeheeless females, and old men ?" in-&#xD;
quired TKate, in the same confiding, and appa-&#xD;
rently artless manner.&#xD;
"Our troops," added Dix, coloring slightly,&#xD;
"cannot always be restrained on account of the&#xD;
cruelties practised by the whigs. It is my&#xD;
solemn conviction that the first party of British&#xD;
dragoons that sweeps through the settlement,&#xD;
will- make a terrible example of William Mar-&#xD;
tin."&#xD;
"Unless," added Kate, "you should possess&#xD;
sufficient influence to stay their sanguinary pro-&#xD;
ceedings !"&#xD;
"Just so, Miss Martin. I am pleased be-.&#xD;
yond expression that ,you have the penetration&#xD;
and forethought to see through this somewhat&#xD;
obscure and very painful subject. I trust, dear&#xD;
young lady, that I have ever been a friend to&#xD;
you and the family ' returned Dix, sentimen-&#xD;
tally.&#xD;
"And I embrace this occasion'to express my&#xD;
thanks," said Miss Martin.&#xD;
"I think I am not mistaken in you," re-&#xD;
sumed the royalist, in a more tender and con-&#xD;
fiding tone, encouraged greatly by the kindness&#xD;
of the maiden. " I feel assured that we under-&#xD;
stand each other."&#xD;
"Yes," added Kate, averting her eyes,&#xD;
timidly.&#xD;
" There are moments when soul speaks to&#xD;
soul, and all the heart's precious secrets are sud-&#xD;
denly and intuitively revealed."&#xD;
&#xD;
Kate looked at the floor, and made no as-&#xD;
swer.&#xD;
"Your condescension makes me extremely&#xD;
happy. Your heightened color assures me that&#xD;
I need not be more explicit on this particular&#xD;
theme. I will lay to my soul the flattering&#xD;
unction, that I have awakened a gentle interest&#xD;
in your bosom."&#xD;
Cyrus Dix took Kate's hand, which she gently&#xD;
withdrew.&#xD;
" I thought, by your manner, that you were&#xD;
about to communicate something of importance,"&#xD;
said Kate, evasively, and with the least possible&#xD;
shadow of a smile, which being observed by&#xD;
Dix, gratified him very much.&#xD;
"I was about to confide to your safe keeping&#xD;
a secret, which will transpire sooner or later.&#xD;
I do this as a proof of that strong yet tender&#xD;
friendship which I have cherished for you for&#xD;
many months. For the last few days I have not&#xD;
been idle. True to the great cause which I&#xD;
have espoused, I have been constantly in the&#xD;
saddle, warning all the royalists in this and the&#xD;
adjoining settlements, to meet at an old field&#xD;
near the cross roads. I found them wide awake&#xD;
for the enterprise, and to-morrow they will be-&#xD;
gin to assemble."&#xD;
"Indeed 1" exclaimed Miss .Martin, with&#xD;
considerable emphasis.&#xD;
" It is true," added the tory ; "and I have&#xD;
been promised a captain's commission. If you&#xD;
really feel that friendship for me that your&#xD;
glowing cheek and timid manner *ould seem to&#xD;
indicate, I trust you will keep this little piece&#xD;
of gossip a profound secret, until we make our-&#xD;
selves known and feared by our deeds."&#xD;
" Why should you doubt my discretion r'&#xD;
said Kate.&#xD;
"I do not, Miss Martin; but it is always&#xD;
well to be guarded about matters of this kind.&#xD;
One of our first movements, after getting fairly&#xD;
organized, will be to hunt up General Marion&#xD;
and his ragamuffin crew, and rid the country of&#xD;
such vagabonds."&#xD;
" Think you can accomplish that matter easi-&#xD;
ly, Captain Dix?" asked Kate, naively.&#xD;
"Without doubt we can," was the confident&#xD;
rejoinder.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Answer me one more question, sir, and I&#xD;
sure that ,you do not deceive a simple-niinde&#xD;
girl," resumed Kate, earnestly. " Are yo&#xD;
quite certain that you are right ?"&#xD;
Cyrus Dix seemed startled at this hom&#xD;
question) and looked steadily at Miss Martin&#xD;
There was evidently some doubt in his mini&#xD;
in regard to the manner in which he, should&#xD;
shape his answer.&#xD;
"It is perfectly evident," he said, hesitating&#xD;
ly, "that I am of the safest side of the quest&#xD;
tion, and the safest side is always the right&#xD;
side! Do you comprehend, Miss Martin ?"&#xD;
"I think I do," returned Kate.&#xD;
"Policy, my fair friend, policy is everything&#xD;
in this world."&#xD;
" Doubtless.  Do you    suppose you car&#xD;
gather much of a company, Captain Dix ?"&#xD;
" About sixty resolute fellows as ever dtewa&#xD;
sword ; all mounted, too."&#xD;
"It will be in your power to throw a strong&#xD;
p-otection around my father," said Kate.&#xD;
If his fair daughter proves kind and con-&#xD;
siderate, he shall suffer no harm in person or&#xD;
property," was the reply.&#xD;
" And if she should not prove 'kind and&#xD;
considerate,' what then ?" asked the maiden.&#xD;
"I will not be answerable for his safety a&#xD;
single day ; no, not for a single hour !" exclaim-&#xD;
ed Dix, striking the table emphatically.&#xD;
" 0 dear, don't look so stern, Mr. Dix !"&#xD;
cried Kate.&#xD;
"Imadem last remark, gentle neighbor, that&#xD;
you might know precisely how the case stands.&#xD;
I wish you to look at the subject in a plain,&#xD;
reasonable, and, matter of factway, and act ac-&#xD;
cordingly. You must endeavor to influence&#xD;
your father."&#xD;
"AMust I?" added Kate.&#xD;
"I have said it, my dear, and pardon me if&#xD;
I insist upon compliance."&#xD;
" Certainly, captain ; you're so much deeper&#xD;
than I am, and know so much more about&#xD;
these things !"&#xD;
" You are the most sensible and reasonable&#xD;
of girls) and I shall always adore you.  You do&#xD;
tot think me positively hateful, do you'?" add-&#xD;
ed Dix, in a taxing voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
be  "I will express my sentiments more freely at&#xD;
d our next interview, perhaps," was the playful&#xD;
u rejoinder.&#xD;
"You are on the non-committal system, I&#xD;
ie perceive."&#xD;
.   Farther conversation of this nature was pre-&#xD;
d vented by the entrance of Mr. Martin.&#xD;
d Dix arose to go, and Kate attended him to&#xD;
the door. He paused on the threshold and&#xD;
;- whispered in her ear :             ' -:&#xD;
-   " All, so far as your quiet and safety are con-&#xD;
t earned, depends upon your'good sense and dis-&#xD;
cretion'/  Should you prove capricious and&#xD;
wayward, as maidens sometimes do', I have a&#xD;
power which you will unwillingly compel me to&#xD;
exercise /"&#xD;
Dix departed, and left'Kate -mistress of his&#xD;
secret, and greatly his superior in shrewdness.&#xD;
a She had experienced considerable difficulty in&#xD;
controlling her virtuous indignation during the&#xD;
interview ; but feeling that much good might&#xD;
result from the practice of some self-control, and&#xD;
a little dissimulation, she had passed through&#xD;
the scope triumphantly. Her noble., and in-&#xD;
genuousmind, at first, revolted against the idea&#xD;
of deception in any case whatever ; but as she&#xD;
looked into  Dix's character, and perceived&#xD;
what he was trying to accomplish, she conquer-&#xD;
ed her aversion, gained a still deeper insight&#xD;
into his nature, and overcame him in the skil-&#xD;
ful playing of that game at which he imagined&#xD;
himself an adept.&#xD;
The unutterable contempt, the ineffable re-&#xD;
pugnance which she felt in her pure soul, when&#xD;
he departed, must be left solely to the imagine,,&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
Her father soon after remarked in her hear-&#xD;
ing,a "that it was greatly to be regretted that a&#xD;
young man, who appeared so honorable, and&#xD;
honest in intention, should embrace so bad a&#xD;
cause."&#xD;
"Do you refer to Mr. Dix, father ?" asked&#xD;
Kate.&#xD;
Mr. Martin replied in the affirmative.&#xD;
"Then I am sorry to be forced to say, tl'at'&#xD;
you are most egregiously mistaken in his char-&#xD;
acter. -'A more unprincipled person it has never-&#xD;
&#xD;
been my fortune to be acquainted with," replied&#xD;
Kate.&#xD;
"Your words greatly astonish me !" exclaim-&#xD;
ed the pastor.  "You should not condemn Mr.&#xD;
Dix so severely on account of his political sen-&#xD;
timents."&#xD;
"You shall judge for yourself," answered&#xD;
Kate ; and she rehearsed the conversation in&#xD;
detail, which had transpired between herself&#xD;
and the party referred to.&#xD;
Mr. Martin was exceedingly surprised at the&#xD;
unexpected relation, and felt that it was indeed&#xD;
difficult to judge of character by the outward&#xD;
seeming.&#xD;
"Things have now assumed an aspect entire-&#xD;
ly unexpected," he added.   "I am pained,&#xD;
embarrassed, and indignant. We are placed in&#xD;
a most unenviable position ; I have long known&#xD;
that the jealous eyes of our enemies are fixed&#xD;
upon me ; and that I am not secure from per-&#xD;
sonal harm for a day, or an hour ; but I had&#xD;
trusted that the hand of villany would fall on&#xD;
me alone, and not involve you, Kate. It seems&#xD;
that I have been mistaken; and have more to'&#xD;
fear rfor you than for myself."&#xD;
"Do not think of nie, father, I fear nothing;,&#xD;
on the contrary, it is for you alone that I trem-&#xD;
ble."&#xD;
"Let not my danger distress you; for it is&#xD;
glorious to die for one's country. But there is.&#xD;
that, you are aware, Kate, which is worse than&#xD;
the change which we call death ; it is dishonor.&#xD;
Whatever situation I may be placed in, let it&#xD;
never influence your conduct, so far as Cyrus&#xD;
Dix is concerned. Pursue a high and Truthful&#xD;
course, never violating your best convictions of&#xD;
right, or going counter to the' still, small voice&#xD;
of that divinity which presides in every virtuous-&#xD;
bosom. A young man like the party referred&#xD;
to, can never be congenial to a nature- like&#xD;
yours; hence no duty which you owe to me or&#xD;
to God, can ever force you into any -nearer re-&#xD;
lationship with him. I make these remarks in&#xD;
order that you may not' be coerced to take a&#xD;
step at which your whole soul revolts. The&#xD;
time may come when these words will be recall-&#xD;
ed, and strengthen you in the path of 4uty. I&#xD;
&#xD;
would die daily the deathof the gibbet, rather&#xD;
than have you connected with such a vilil ;as&#xD;
Dix has proved himself to be."&#xD;
"My own instincts would teach me to ,shn&#xD;
him, if you had never expressed your sentiments&#xD;
on the subject."&#xD;
"In regard to this'torn gathering, at the old&#xD;
field, near the cross-roads, it seems, to anc somne&#xD;
thing ought to be done about it," resumned"fr&#xD;
Martin.&#xD;
"I have already considered the matter, and&#xD;
decided what ought to be done," replied Kate.&#xD;
"Let me hear your plan," said her father,&#xD;
with a smile.&#xD;
"I perceive that you are inclined to imagine&#xD;
that a girl's judgment in such matters must&#xD;
necessarily be worth but little," rejoined Kate.&#xD;
" But I will disclose my scheme, nevertheless.&#xD;
I propose to advise Marion's Brigade of the tory&#xD;
gathering."&#xD;
" But have you devised the means of its ac-&#xD;
complishment ?" asked the father.&#xD;
"Certainly; I intend to carry the intelligence&#xD;
to Marion myself."&#xD;
" You, Kate !"&#xD;
"My own important self!" rejoined 1 ate,&#xD;
pleasantly.&#xD;
"It is impracticable."&#xD;
"Not so, father.&#xD;
" I cannot permit it."&#xD;
"I think you will."&#xD;
"I will go myself."&#xD;
"That is out of the puesion; you wonld&#xD;
never reach the Santee, if you should attend pt&#xD;
it. You would be stopped by the, stores ; con-&#xD;
sequently much would be lost 'and niothi-g&#xD;
gained."&#xD;
"Very true ; I should naturally be ,aspect-&#xD;
ed. There is more sense in your littlehed&#xD;
than I had given you credit for."&#xD;
"Thank you, father'; we are getting on very&#xD;
well. You know you have got an excellent&#xD;
young horse in the stable ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Kate."&#xD;

she heard the clattering of horses' feet, which&#xD;
grew more distinct, and appeared to be approach-&#xD;

feeling somewhat anxious for the result, Kate&#xD;
resolutely pursued her way. It proved to be a&#xD;

near enough to Kate to distinguish the outlines&#xD;
of her figure.&#xD;
"Is it you, Miss Martin ?" said a voice.&#xD;

a- debt of gratitude, and can't never pay it. I&#xD;
know you'll despise me for acting as I have,&#xD;
but I can't help it now, and it's no use to cry&#xD;
about the past."&#xD;
"You'll be a fie lad yet, I dare say," said&#xD;
Kate, kindly ; " and, you will doubtless wipe&#xD;
out *  errors of-the past 'by the doings of the'&#xD;
future that is now before you."',4&#xD;
"4If everybody had been like you, Miss Kate,&#xD;
I shouldn't have been what I am; but they&#xD;
aint, and never will be. The bloodhounds of&#xD;
Captain Nick would soon have torn me in&#xD;
pieces, if you hadn't shown your blessed face&#xD;
just as you did. Yes, they would have killed&#xD;
me, as if my life had been worth no more- than'&#xD;
that of a miserable cur."   -&#xD;
"An offence like yours, I believe, is always,&#xD;
punished with death," remarked Kate.&#xD;
- "I know it is;. but we'll let that pass.&#xD;
Henceforth I care nothing about parties ; I will&#xD;
serve yuonlyI; you shall be my queen, and i&#xD;

slaves. There is no service so hard, so danger-&#xD;
ous, or so humiliating, but that I will not at- e&#xD;

"Such language surprises me," exclaimed-&#xD;
Kate.&#xD;
" That's because you didn't expect gratitude&#xD;
from a man who could be base enoagh to be-&#xD;
tray his neighbors.' . You can say it boldly in&#xD;
plain words, if you want to, and I wont think&#xD;
hard of you."&#xD;
"I am glad that you have redeeming quali-&#xD;
ties, Joe ; but I cannot stop to talk with you&#xD;
now. I have far to ride."&#xD;
"I shan't leave you, Kate Martin. I'll fol-&#xD;

"To Marion's camp, Joe ?"        .&#xD;
"Yes, to -" and Sawyer named a locality&#xD;
supposed to be warmer than the tropics, by&#xD;
many degrees. f' You can't shake me off; go&#xD;
where you will, I'll tramp after you, see if I&#xD;

"But what possible motive can you have for&#xD;
persisting in such a strange course'?"&#xD;
" To look after you, if you should be in dan-&#xD;
ger, and die for you like a dog that perishes for&#xD;
his master," said Sawyer.&#xD;
'' But you were afraid of death the other day,&#xD;
Joe ?"&#xD;
" I was engaged in a bad cause, then, Miss&#xD;
Martin ; and a bad cause makes anybody a&#xD;
miserable coward. Yes, I will'go anywhere&#xD;
with you !"&#xD;
"I'm obliged to you, I'm sure."&#xD;
"Not at all, and I don't much care whether&#xD;
you are obliged to me or not, so long as I can&#xD;
be the means of doing you any good. I can&#xD;
guess pretty well where you're going now, and&#xD;

her face towards the tory leader, and the bright&#xD;
moon shining upon it, rendered its fair features&#xD;
perfectly visible.&#xD;
"What loveliness !" exclaimed, the colonel,&#xD;
involuntarily, and at the same time laid his hand&#xD;
on the bridle rein of Victor.&#xD;
"Hands off, cap'en; don't handle the goods !"&#xD;
said Joe.&#xD;
"Back, fellow !" thundered Cunningham,&#xD;
in a passion.&#xD;
"I shall protect her with my life," added&#xD;
Joe.,&#xD;
"Be quiet, or by - I shall fire !" ex-&#xD;
claimed the colonel, levelling his pistol at Saw--&#xD;
yer's breast.&#xD;
"I perceive you are an officer," said Kate,&#xD;
firmly; "and I trust you are a gallant gentle-&#xD;
man. Let us pass on without farther words."&#xD;
" If I had not seen that exquisite face, pret-&#xD;
ty maiden, you might have gone on as fast and&#xD;
as far as you pleased ; but the sight'of so much&#xD;
beauty has made me a little giddy."&#xD;
Joe spurred his horse, and he reared and&#xD;
pressed hard against the colonel, which greatly&#xD;
enraged him, and he discharged his pistol at&#xD;
Kate's defender. The ball took effect upon his&#xD;
right side, and inflicting a slight flesh wound,&#xD;
glanced off wit bout doing any serious injury.&#xD;
Joe instantly drerva heavy horse pistol from the&#xD;
breast-pocket of his coat, and bending forward&#xD;
gave Cunningham a stunning blow upon the&#xD;
head which knocked him senseless. y&#xD;
Spur on, Queen Kate 1" cried Joe.&#xD;
Victor feeling himself at liberty once more,&#xD;
sprang over 'the body of the colonel, and swept&#xD;
onward at 'his best speed.&#xD;
" It's no time to let the grass grow under our&#xD;
feet ; Cunninghian will be up and after us with&#xD;
his fellows," added Sawyer., " He's a man&#xD;
that don't like to he disappointed when he has&#xD;
set his mind on having his own way."&#xD;
"I think we -hall do -very well now. Some&#xD;
considerable timte must necessarily elapse before&#xD;
he can get his ien in the saddle," answered&#xD;
Kate.&#xD;
"Anger wih ,numke him work fast," returned&#xD;
Joe. ' Be. i   the idea of your comely face&#xD;
&#xD;
will be running in his head, and they say he is&#xD;
not over and above particular about his con-&#xD;
science."&#xD;
"Victor is fleet of foot, Joe, and his spirit is&#xD;
by no means, sobered down by his efforts," re-&#xD;
plied Miss Martin, with a display of calmness&#xD;
which Joe had not expected.&#xD;
They had galloped forward for ten or fifteen&#xD;
minutes, when Joe stopped and said he believed&#xD;
they had taken the wrong road. He examined&#xD;
the locality as well as' he cold, and was still&#xD;
in doubt in regard to the matter. This circum-&#xD;
stance perplexed Kate greatly, for she felt that&#xD;
every moment was precious.&#xD;
" Decide quickly !" she exclaimed, "for this&#xD;
delay makes me exceedingly nervous."&#xD;
"I'll obey you, Queen Kate, as soon as pos-&#xD;
sible. It strikes me that it would be better to&#xD;
stay where we are, than to go in the wrong&#xD;
direction."&#xD;
Joe now dismounted, and requesting Kate to&#xD;
hold his horse, surveyed the locality, ,more&#xD;
minutely. , In a short time he returned and in-&#xD;
formed her that they had left the main and&#xD;
direct road, but that there could be but little&#xD;
doubt that the one they were now in would&#xD;
lead them into it again. They proceeded with&#xD;
less speed and some uncertainty, and the latter&#xD;
feeling became so strong in the minds of both,&#xD;
that they were induced to halt for the second&#xD;
time. While Joe sat irresolute about going&#xD;
forward, an ominous sound reached his ears ;&#xD;
and not his only, but Kate's.&#xD;
"The tramp of many horses!" exclaimed the,&#xD;
latter, in a suppressed tone of voice.&#xD;
" Cunningham's' cut-throats," said Sawyer.&#xD;
Curse his haste !"&#xD;
"What is to be done ?" asked Kate, prompt-&#xD;
ly.  " Think fast, Joe."&#xD;
"Remain where we are, and trust to luck.&#xD;
Perhaps they'll take the other road, and in that&#xD;
ctse we shall stand a pretty fair chance of get-&#xD;
ting clear of them."&#xD;
"And if we should not elude them, what&#xD;
then?" asked Kate, earnestly.&#xD;

" Jones, what's your horse, tryin' to do?"&#xD;
asked Captain Hawes.&#xD;
" He's a colt, cap'en, as hasn't been weaned&#xD;
long," replied Jones, grasping the animal's&#xD;
mane to keep himself steady.&#xD;
" Well, stick to him for the sake of your&#xD;
country, and humanity generally," added Cap-&#xD;
'tain Nick, encouragingly. Unfortunately, how-&#xD;
ever, for " humanity," at that crisis the colt&#xD;
made an airy and highly original evolution, not&#xD;
laid down in any military work then extant, and&#xD;
poor Jones was east like an untimely fig.&#xD;

"Nay, friend Benjamin, do not such a wick-&#xD;

"The deuce take the. ' tents of Israel' !"&#xD;
cried Rowan, wrathfully, and mimicking Daw-&#xD;

"What evil hast thou found in me ?" added&#xD;
Job.&#xD;
"You're a humbug, generally," responded&#xD;
Rowan, " Look out'! I'm going to hit you in&#xD;

"ICannot this thing be put off till a more con-&#xD;

"'Twould be sinful to put it off half a minute&#xD;

Rowan made a pass at Job's face, which he&#xD;
parried.&#xD;
"Verily, if I must defend myself, I have no&#xD;
power to gainsay thee ; but my soul abhorreth&#xD;
contention, for I am a man of peace," he said,&#xD;
quietly, turning aside Rowan's rapidly dealt&#xD;
blows without any apparent exertion.&#xD;
"I bear thee no malice, good Benjamin, yet&#xD;
I will obey thee to the best of my humble&#xD;
abilities."'&#xD;
While Dawson was uttering these words, in&#xD;
his usual mild manner, he raised his great fist&#xD;
and gave Rowan a blow under the ear that&#xD;
made him recoil several yards, and fall heavily&#xD;
at Forstall's feet.&#xD;
Verily, I am a peace-maker, and have no&#xD;
pleasure in ,contention," added Job, seating&#xD;
himself calmly upon the grass.&#xD;
&#xD;
by side as usual; but the latter, it was observed,&#xD;
had a swollen head and face.&#xD;
Nick Hawes rode up to General Marion, and&#xD;
remarked, for the second time; that the "In-&#xD;
dependent Fire Eaters made a most heavenly&#xD;
appearance, now they were straightened up on&#xD;
horses ;" and the general smilingly ,replied,&#xD;
"that they certainly did."&#xD;
It was at this particular period that Kate&#xD;
Martin and Joe Sawyer rode into camp, with&#xD;
foaming and panting steeds.&#xD;
"The divine Kate !" exclaimed Henderson,&#xD;
involuntarily.'-&#xD;
" There's that traitor feller," said 'Hawes.&#xD;
"That's General Marion," said the ser eant&#xD;
of the guard, who had conducted Kate on othe&#xD;
field.&#xD;
Kate turned towards the general, and the lat-&#xD;
ter, brave as he was, appeared somewhat be-&#xD;
wildered and confused by -her dazzling beauty.&#xD;
He gallantly doffed his leathern cap, and begged&#xD;
to have the pleasure of knowing how he could&#xD;
serve so fair a mnaiden.&#xD;
"Perhaps there are too many ears here," he&#xD;
added, quickly.  "Be good enough to come&#xD;
this way ; for I perceive your business may be&#xD;
of importance."&#xD;
With a glowing cheek, Kate complied, and&#xD;
related in detail the object of her -visit, describ-&#xD;
ing as well as she could the place of tory rei-&#xD;
dezvous, and making such remarks, as her infor-&#xD;
&#xD;
MARION'S&#xD;
&#xD;
mation would justify, in regard to the numbers&#xD;
of the royalists. Joe Sawyer did not leave&#xD;
Kate's side for a moment, and seemed to con-&#xD;
sider it a post of honor ; and we have no hesita-&#xD;
tion in saying that the gallant Mr. Henderson&#xD;
would have regarded it in the same light, He&#xD;
envied Joe his situation; and as soon as she&#xD;
had finished speaking with the general, he ad-&#xD;
vanced to address her.&#xD;
"Stand back, and you can see just as well,"&#xD;
said Joe, evidently deeming his approaches an&#xD;
intrusion.. Miss Martin smiled, and gracefully&#xD;
acknowledged Henderson's salutation. The lat-&#xD;
ter then formally presented her to the general.&#xD;
"The brigade will have the honor of escort-&#xD;
ing you'to Rocky Creek, Miss Martin," said&#xD;
Marion. "As you are so fortunate as to know&#xD;
Mr. Henderson, I will confide you to his care&#xD;
until the brigade is in readiness to move forward.&#xD;
I regret that you cannot find among us those&#xD;
comforts which you must necessarily need after&#xD;
so much exertion; We live as we can, and not&#xD;
as we would.  Our enemies, should you. visit&#xD;
them, could conduct you to a marquee, com-&#xD;
fortable and even luxurious ; but the friends of&#xD;
liberty are obliged to sleep on the ground, with&#xD;
no other canopy than that of the arching heav-&#xD;
ens. To my rough tent, Mr. Henderson will&#xD;
now conduct you, and no one will intrude upon&#xD;
you, while there."&#xD;
"Such courtesy well befits a brave chieftain,&#xD;
and a gallant gentleman, replied Kate.  "A&#xD;
cause so just makes any place endurable, and the&#xD;
post of danger honorable. I shall be as happy&#xD;
in your rude tent as the proudest royalist-in his&#xD;
luxurious marquee. Now, Mr. Henderson, I&#xD;
gladly accept you as my cicerone to the tent."&#xD;
"I can assure you that be is well content,"-&#xD;
remarked the general, pleasantly. _&#xD;
" I confess to the charge," rejoined Hender-&#xD;
son, and touching his cap, turned from the gen-&#xD;
eral and conducted Kate to the place designated;&#xD;
while Joe Sawyer followed with a sullen brow,&#xD;
jealous that another should occupy the place&#xD;
which he had assumed, and which appeared his&#xD;
as a matter of course.&#xD;
Leaving the brigade to march towards Rocky&#xD;
&#xD;
BRIGADE.                                51&#xD;
Creek at their leisure, we will look after some&#xD;
of our other characters.&#xD;
We will begin by informing the kind reader,&#xD;
that Mary Adair and Ruth Strickland were on&#xD;
intimate terms. This being the case, that they&#xD;
should visit each other, would be a natural re-&#xD;
silt, and we shall, on the occasion referred to,&#xD;
find. Miss Adair at Mr. Strickland's. ' The'&#xD;
capture of Gainey and Cunningham, had given&#xD;
the former great pleasure, inasmuch as that&#xD;
event effected the liberation of her brother, and&#xD;
she hoped freed her from farther impertinence&#xD;
from the colonel. As a consequence, she ex-&#xD;
perienced considerable uneasiness when she&#xD;
heard of the escape of the latter. This feeling&#xD;
of anxiety was considerably increased by certain&#xD;
rumors, whichhad reached her ears, in regard to&#xD;
various remarks, relating to herself, which he&#xD;
had made in the presence of several persons.&#xD;
Those who had overheard these observations,&#xD;
had repeated them again to others, and so they&#xD;
finally reached the ears of Miss Adair.&#xD;
That Colonel Cunningham   was a bad man,&#xD;
was something well known to all wh'o had heard&#xD;
his odious name, in that portion of the country.&#xD;
His cruelties had spread terror wherever the his-&#xD;
tory of the same had been related. To be&#xD;
sought after by such a hard and remorseless&#xD;
miscreant, ~ gave the gentle Mary a feeling of&#xD;
uneasiness which it would be quite impossible&#xD;
to describe. The scene of'her first - meeting&#xD;
with him had made an impression which could&#xD;
never be effaced. His cruel, and unprovoked&#xD;
order, to murder her brother, had filled her&#xD;
with so much horror, that the very memory of&#xD;
that event was deeply painful. The reader will&#xD;
perceive, then, that the name of Cunningham&#xD;
was coupled with all that was dreadful and re-&#xD;
pugnant, in the mind of Miss Adair.&#xD;
During the conversation that ensued.between&#xD;
the* latter and Ruth Strickland, Cunningham&#xD;
was more than once referred to.&#xD;
" The news of his escape," said Miss Adair,&#xD;
"fills me with a nameless terror, which I can&#xD;
neither explain, nor account for."&#xD;
"Common report assures me that he admired&#xD;
your person not a little," replied Ruth ; " and&#xD;

did not take any pains to conceal' his sentiments.&#xD;
You have spoken of his escape, but I can tell&#xD;
you of a more recent piece of news ; Major&#xD;
Gainey is also at large. How he obtained his&#xD;
freedom, I know not, and I confess that the&#xD;
event is quite as unwelcome to me, as the es-&#xD;
cape of Cunningham seems to be to you."&#xD;
"From what I can learn of the man, the two&#xD;
are well mated. Both are deaf to the voice of&#xD;
humanity, as their deeds abundantly testify,"&#xD;
rejoined Mary.  " That you should shrink from&#xD;
him, is what I can well understand and appre-&#xD;
ciate. I am aware that you stand in much the&#xD;
same relation to the major, that it is reported I&#xD;
-    do in regard to him whose name I can scarcely&#xD;
pronounce without a shudder. If the two are&#xD;
indeed at liberty, I believe that our apprehen-&#xD;
sions and forebodings will not prove unfounded,&#xD;
or premature."       -&#xD;
The conversation was interrupted by the en-&#xD;
trance of Mrs. Strickland, who told them, with&#xD;
considerable agitation of manner, that one of the&#xD;
neighbors had just informed her that Cunning-&#xD;
ham was down below the Neck, with a party of&#xD;
tories, and would probably be up. that way be-&#xD;
fore long,&#xD;
"Did you hear anything in relation to Major&#xD;
Gainey ?" inquired Ruth.-&#xD;
"1My informant said it was reported that he&#xD;
had joined Colonel Cunningham ; and it was&#xD;
through the agency of the colonel that his escape&#xD;
was effected," replied Mrs. Strickland.&#xD;
While the parties were conversing on this&#xD;
subject, a colored servant appeared, and an-&#xD;
nounced that a gentleman was without who de-&#xD;
sired to speak a few words to Miss Adair. Mary&#xD;
,blushed and hastened to the door, remarking as&#xD;
she left the apartment, " that it was doubtless&#xD;
her brother."S&#xD;
A man of large frame stood near the steps.&#xD;
He was holding by the bridle, a horse from&#xD;
which he had evidently just dismounted. A&#xD;
capacious military cloak concealed most of his&#xD;
figure from view, and the lower portion of his&#xD;
face. The hilt of a sabre was seen peeping&#xD;
from the ample folds. The features which-were&#xD;
visible, were highly prepossessing ; the eyes&#xD;
were very blue and mild.&#xD;

He held the little hand, which Mary timidly&#xD;
extended, a long time in his, and it seemed not&#xD;
a very unwilling prisoner.&#xD;
"How dared you venture here when Colonel&#xD;
Cunningham is down below !" she exclaimed.&#xD;
" The brigade is- moving towards Rocky&#xD;
Creek, and I have left it for the purpose of&#xD;
seeing you for a moment," replied the young&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"You have diverged considerably from your&#xD;
way, and incurred considerable danger, I should,&#xD;
think," returned Miss Adair.&#xD;
" The danger I regard but little when I am&#xD;
approaching the spot rendered dear to me by&#xD;
the presence of Mary Adair. Danger I have&#xD;
become familiar with, in all the forms in which&#xD;
pitiless war presents it," said the other, earn-&#xD;
estly.&#xD;
" I know you are brave, Lewis," replied&#xD;
Mary.&#xD;
Lewis Hawthorne, as we shall call him, ac-,&#xD;
knowledged the compliment by a bow and a&#xD;
smile.,&#xD;
" I have but little time," he added, "and&#xD;
therefore must improve it to the best advantage.&#xD;
Be kind enough to walk with me a few steps,&#xD;
and we will converse as we move along."&#xD;
" Is it true," asked Mary, "that IMgjor&#xD;
Gainey has escaped ?"&#xD;
" It is; but I think that the fact need not&#xD;
disturb you or your fair friend, whom it is said&#xD;
he admires. It seems to me that he will hardly&#xD;
feel inclined to venture up this way again,&#xD;
while Marion's Brigade is within a day's march&#xD;
of the place," rejoined Harthorne.&#xD;
" Perhaps not, Lewis; but Cunninghans has&#xD;
not the fear of Marion before his eyes, it ap-&#xD;
pears ; and we expect a visit from him hourly,"&#xD;
said Mary.&#xD;
" I hope he will not be so bold. It would&#xD;
pain me 'exceedingly, and make me very anx-&#xD;
ionus for your safety, if I thought he had any '&#xD;
such intention."&#xD;
" My sex have the reputation of being ,na-&#xD;
turally timid ; but I trust that you will not es-&#xD;
teem me weak and superstitious, when I frankly&#xD;
confess that I feel a premonition of approaching,&#xD;
&#xD;
MA1AIOWas BRiGADEt&#xD;
&#xD;
evil,:and it hasreference to 'Colonel Cunning-&#xD;
ham."&#xD;
"I am not one to judge hastily. I shall be&#xD;
the last ,one to think you weak or superstitious.&#xD;
I know that your mind is well balanced, and&#xD;
not 'easily misdirected. I am not ashamed to&#xD;
say, that there is to me something prophetic in&#xD;
the instincts or intuition'of a pure woman ; .pon&#xD;
such, at times, the true spirit of prevision seems&#xD;
to rest.,- I do not, by any means, scoff at the&#xD;
soul's far reaching into the future ; for it&#xD;
has wonderful powers," returned Hawthorne,&#xD;
warmly..&#xD;
"There is one subject upon which, I 'would&#xD;
appak before'we part," said Mary.  "The;part&#xD;
which you are enacting in the terrible.tragedy&#xD;
of war, in extremely perilous. In the name'of&#xD;
that friendship which your lips have avowed; I&#xD;
ask you to be careful of that life which younow&#xD;
so freely and so.often expose to the shafts of&#xD;
death:. There is more than one heart that&#xD;
would mourn your exit ,from earth."&#xD;
" I am indeed gratified, my beloved Mary,&#xD;
fr 'these friendly expressions of regard. I shall&#xD;
en eavor to prove myself worthy of the friend-&#xD;
shi which you are so condescending asto con-&#xD;
fe upon me. I am aware that my position is&#xD;
often perilous, and that my duties require much&#xD;
tact, prudence and courage. But the thought&#xD;
of Mary Adair imparts new strength and forti-&#xD;
tude when the heart is ready to despair. Mine&#xD;
is truly a difficult part to play ; but I have&#xD;
played it thus far successfully. Few are in my&#xD;
steret, and those that are, will not betray ine.&#xD;
The cause in which I act is a gpod one, and I&#xD;
am willing to peril life for the sake of my un-&#xD;
happy and oppressed country. Should Colonel&#xD;
Cunningham presume to visit this place, and&#xD;
dare attempt to place himself upon .familiar&#xD;
terms with you, or to offer you any personal in-&#xD;
sult, endeavor, by some means, to give me in-&#xD;
telligence of what is transpiring. If you can&#xD;
send word to Marion's Brigade, an hundred&#xD;
horsemen, brave and stalwort, will be ready to&#xD;
gallopto your aid. And it would be well for&#xD;
you to inform your friend, Miss- Strickland,.&#xD;
whose name I have heard you mention, of this&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
request, in order that she may make it avail-&#xD;
able, should anything unexpectedly happen to&#xD;
prevent you from attending to - it yourself. I&#xD;
will suggest, -furthermore, that whatever intel-&#xD;
ligence .you may gain in regard to-the general&#xD;
and particular movements of the tories that ybu&#xD;
may consider of any importance, should be trans-&#xD;
mitted to the brigade, if any possible means&#xD;
should offer."&#xD;
"Ipromise acquiescence," rejoined Mary. "I&#xD;
shall do my best to comply with your wishes."&#xD;
" Hark !" she added,- emphatically.&#xD;
Hawthorne paused, and looked down the&#xD;
river.&#xD;
" I am betrayed!" he exclaimed-. "The&#xD;
tory bloodhounds are on the scent.&#xD;
Miss Adair had also turned-her eyes iiitIle&#xD;
direction specified, and beheld a band of twenty&#xD;
or thirty royalists approaching at a gallop.&#xD;
"'Itis Cunningham himself at the head of&#xD;
his dragoon !" cried Mary.    "Alas, ycur&#xD;
temerity will cost you your'life 4"&#xD;
Hawthorne sprang into the saddle and cast a&#xD;
hurried glance around him, to discover the best&#xD;
method of escape.&#xD;
"Delay not a single'instant, as you love me I&#xD;
See, they are coming at fearful speed. Fly,&#xD;
Lewis, fly !" added Mary, excited beyond de-&#xD;
scription.       A&#xD;
"Farewell, Mary ! I go-I trust in Provi-&#xD;
dence. Remember:what I have said."&#xD;
"Surrender, you rebel !" cried a voice which&#xD;
Mary recognized as the voice of Cunningham.&#xD;
For a reply, Hawthorne touched his horse's&#xD;
flanks with his spurs, and swept away up the&#xD;
river road like the wind. As he bounded for-&#xD;
ward, a dozen carbines were fired at hinm, and&#xD;
the terrified and half-fainting Mary heard the&#xD;
leaden messengers whistle over her head.&#xD;
"Cut him down, men ! hew him to pieces-&#xD;
no quarters to the rascal!" shouted Cunningham,&#xD;
as he passed the maiden at a furious gallop.&#xD;
He gave her a significant look as he dashed by,'&#xD;
in which the cruelty of his nature was but too&#xD;
evidently expressed.&#xD;
It was some time after the tories had passed,&#xD;
before Mary could gain courage to look after&#xD;

Hawthrone, to see if he had fallen; when she&#xD;
did so, she beheld him about the same distapee&#xD;
from his pursuers, as at the beginning of the race.&#xD;
His horse appeared a powerful one, and in good&#xD;
condition, while she observed that those ridden&#xD;
by the royalists were already somewhat blown,&#xD;
With emotions which will not admit of de-&#xD;
scription, she saw bright blades unsheathed and&#xD;
brandished in the air; and heard continual re-&#xD;
ports of carbines and pistols.  The road which&#xD;
the parties had taken, was straight and level for&#xD;
a considerable distance, and she had a fair view&#xD;
of-the exciting scene. She kept her gaze fasten-&#xD;
ed upon the pursued and the pursuers, as though&#xD;
she had no power to turn it in any other diree-&#xD;
tion. / She perceived that one of the horsemen,&#xD;
being better mounted than his comrades, was&#xD;
fast leaving them in the rear and gaining upon&#xD;
Hawthorne ; while the latter appeared to be&#xD;
making no additional efforts to increase his&#xD;
speed.M&#xD;
Mary Adair's heart beat fast, and every pulse&#xD;
&#xD;
was full of racking suspense. ,With fearful an.&#xD;
ticipations of the catastrophe, she beheld the tory&#xD;
horseman nearing the object of her solicitude.&#xD;
She saw him within the distance of a few yards--.&#xD;
of halfa-dozen-of four-of three-of one, and&#xD;
then he bent forward in his saddle, andlifted his&#xD;
sword to give a fatal blow; but at that moment,&#xD;
when Mary considered all hope lost, Hawthorne&#xD;
turned suddenly upon his pursuer, and with a&#xD;
single sweep of his ponderous sabre, cut him&#xD;
down ; he fell, and his earthly warfare was at&#xD;
an end. Hawthorne made no pause, but waving&#xD;
his sabre triumphantly, shot forward at a much&#xD;
greater speed.&#xD;
"He's safe ! he's safe !" exclaimed Mary,&#xD;
with outgushing emotions of joy.&#xD;
"Who is safe-what has happened ?" asked&#xD;
Uuth Strickland, who had approached, attract-&#xD;
ed by the sound of firing, and the tumult ,of&#xD;
pursuit. She repeated her question, but Mary&#xD;
could not answer, she had become unconscious.&#xD;
&#xD;
ARION'S Brigade was moving towards&#xD;
Rocky Creek. To John Henderson it&#xD;
was a most agreeable march, for he rode beside&#xD;
Kate Martin, and her silvery voice sounded to&#xD;
him like the sweetest music. To her peerless&#xD;
beauty he had added the idea of her heroism,&#xD;
which had been exemplified by her daring con-&#xD;
duet on the night previous. The pastor's fair&#xD;
and brave daughter could not rise much in the&#xD;
estimation of Henderson; so far as his opinion&#xD;
was concerned, she already stood on the pinna-&#xD;
cle of female perfection. That he kept very&#xD;
near her person, that he talked earnestly, and&#xD;
hung with fond enthusiasm on her every word,&#xD;
is no more than the considerate reader is pre-&#xD;
pared to expect.&#xD;
While the gallant Henderson is drinking in&#xD;
the soft enchantment of Kato Martin's beauty,&#xD;
we will see how Frank Forstall fares, and follow&#xD;
his movements for a short time.'&#xD;
The voice of Ben Rowan was less frequently&#xD;
heard ; an unwonted taciturnity had fallen upon&#xD;
him since the " pulverizing " scene had trans-&#xD;
pired, and Frank was left more to his own re-&#xD;
flections. The thought occurred to him, when&#xD;
&#xD;
he saw Henderson so pleasantly engaged with&#xD;
Kate Martin, that a friendly chat with Ruth&#xD;
Strickland would be exceedingly agreeable.&#xD;
This idea induced him to ask permission of Cap-&#xD;
tain Logan for an hour's absence, in order that&#xD;
theory and practice  might be  harmoniously&#xD;
blended-a thing not always practicable. The&#xD;
captain consented, though somewhat reluctantly,&#xD;
because, he said, it was not safe for people to be&#xD;
riding about the country alone ,when the tories&#xD;
were so much on the alert, and so full of mist&#xD;
chief. Considerations of this nature, however,&#xD;
had but little influence' with Forstall, and we&#xD;
are inclined to believe that in all genuine love.&#xD;
matters, danger is. little thought of, or eared&#xD;
for. Casting a parting glance at  enderson,&#xD;
half envious, we fear; he fell out of the ranks o&#xD;
the brigade, and taking across road, galloped&#xD;
towards the residence of Ruth Strickland, his&#xD;
heart expanding, meanwhile, with the antici-&#xD;
pated joy of meeting her again.&#xD;
He resolved, most firmly and seriously, to&#xD;
make that declaration which had more than&#xD;
once trerdbled upon his fearful tongue. Fill df&#xD;
this daring, and to him momentous conception,&#xD;

Before Forstall had fairly taken in the scene&#xD;
with his eyes, he was in the midst of the ,tories,&#xD;
and many sabres were raised to cut him dowei..&#xD;
"Hold, men !" cried Cunningham. "Not&#xD;
so fast, niy lads.. We'll do something better&#xD;
than that."&#xD;
Forstall drew his sabre and defended himself&#xD;
vigorously, inflicting several severe wounds, but&#xD;
the odds against him were so overpowering, he&#xD;
was soon disarmed and a prisoner.,&#xD;
"It strikes me that I have seen your face&#xD;
before, young man," said an ,ficer, scrutinizing&#xD;
Frank 'pretty closely..&#xD;
Forstall looked :towards the speaker and re-&#xD;
eognized Major Gainey.&#xD;
" Ithigk you 'have,, sir ; :I was at Britten's&#xD;
Neck with General Marion," said Frank, sar-&#xD;
",Such allusions as those will prove very  n-&#xD;
fortunate for you, my fine fellow 1" retorted&#xD;
the n9r, angrily.,&#xD;
"When the vicissitudes of war placed you in&#xD;
our hands; you were tell! treated and had noth.&#xD;
ing to complain of, I believe," added Forstall.&#xD;
"What is your name, young man ?" asked&#xD;
'unningham .&#xD;
" One that: has never been dishonored by&#xD;
cruelty, cowardice, or meanness. I am called&#xD;
Forstall," replied Frank.&#xD;
Cunninghaon immediately said something to&#xD;
Gainey in a low voice, and the latter scowled&#xD;
fiercely at our hero.&#xD;
"You see that body, don't you ?" he asked,&#xD;
pointing to the corpse in the road.&#xD;
'I do ; and. I should say that it was made&#xD;
a body by an ugly sabre cut on the head," an-&#xD;
swered Forstall.&#xD;
"That man, young rebel, was a royalist, and&#xD;
his life was worth half-a-dozen like yours," con-&#xD;
tinued the major.&#xD;
"I regret, then, that he hadn't died in a&#xD;
better cause," rejoined Frank.&#xD;
" The deuce you do, sir !" cried. the major,&#xD;
angrily.&#xD;
" Decidedly," returned Frank, firmly.&#xD;
&#xD;
MARION'SBRIGA DE.&#xD;
&#xD;
" That braye fellow was; killed by a' rebel,"&#xD;
answered Gainey.&#xD;
" Better than to die by the hand of the hang-&#xD;
man," said Frank.&#xD;
" Remember that ydu are speaking to one of&#xD;
his majesty's officers," said Cunningham.&#xD;
"One of Marion's ruffians did that," resum-&#xD;
ed the major, pointing at the body again.&#xD;
"I thought one of our sabres made that&#xD;
wound," replied Forstall, regarding the ghastly&#xD;
opening in the dead man's head, more parti-&#xD;

"And have you yet thought. what the con-&#xD;
sequences would be to yourself,: sir ?" said&#xD;
Gainey.&#xD;
"I am a prisoner of war, and expect to be&#xD;
treated as such."&#xD;
"Just hear the rascal talk I" exclaimed Cuj-&#xD;
ningham.   "You'll be. treated according to&#xD;
your deserts," he added.&#xD;
"How is that'?" asked Forstall.&#xD;
'It means that you will be ,fteated to a&#xD;
hanging, sir !" vociferated Gainey.&#xD;
- " You dare not commit such an outrage upon&#xD;
the usages of civilized nations !" exclaimed&#xD;
Frank, boldly.&#xD;
"ip with him ! up with him I" cried sev-&#xD;
eral voices, impatiently.  .&#xD;
"There's a fine tree 'for the purpose,"re-&#xD;
marked the colonel, pointing to a thrifty' oak a&#xD;
few yards beyond them.&#xD;
At this juncture the rest of the party came&#xD;
thundering down the river, and joined their&#xD;
comrades.&#xD;
"We knew you'd fetch him- up t" said one&#xD;
wearing the uniform of an officer.&#xD;
"We started him about a mile and a half&#xD;
above here. But the other fellow gave as the&#xD;
slip. Don't waste time ; do up the work in an&#xD;
offhand manner," he added.&#xD;
"Rebel, your time"Is short," remarked&#xD;
Gainey.&#xD;
"Do you intend to perpetrate another mur-&#xD;

"Prepare yourself, youngster," said Otin-&#xD;
ningham.   "Think  about your' mother, and&#xD;
your prayers."&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
THE RESCUE.&#xD;
&#xD;
T HE brigade moved steadily forward.&#xD;
Henderson was still entranced with the&#xD;
silvery tones of Kate Martin, and Joe 'Sawyer&#xD;
looked at him.wijh jealous-eyes.&#xD;
"Where is Mr. Forstall ?" asked General&#xD;
,Marion, addressing Captain Logan.&#xD;
" He asked permiAon tocall at Britton's&#xD;
Neck, and I couldn't very well: refuse his re-&#xD;
4uest, he's such a gallant young fellow," re-&#xD;
plied the captain.&#xD;
- "I'm sorry, for I have just learned from a,&#xD;
lad, that Colonel Cunningham is in that vicinity&#xD;
again, with quite a body of tories. Forstall&#xD;
will be likely to fall in with him, I'm afraid,"&#xD;
said the general.1&#xD;
a' Perhaps we had better send a few of our&#xD;
men after him," suggested Logan.-&#xD;
"I will send Captain Hawes and his 'tarnal&#xD;
critters,' " added Marion, good humoredly, and&#xD;
immediately rode up to the personage referred&#xD;
to.l He explained the case to him in a few&#xD;
words, and ordered him to ride after Forstall,&#xD;
as fast as possible, with his company.&#xD;
"I expect the chap is galivantin' arter some&#xD;
feminine specimint," said Captain Nick. "But&#xD;
I can't blame the youngster much, for I kind-&#xD;
er calkerlate I shall do somethin' in that per-&#xD;
ticerlar line as soon as I can git time, after&#xD;
finishin' the reverlttion."-&#xD;
&#xD;
4" Quite right, sir ; the sex should be attend-&#xD;
ed to, and are certainly worthy of respect," re-&#xD;
plied Marion. f' Now, captain, away with you,&#xD;
and rejoin us again As soon as possible."&#xD;
"I'm off like a streak of chalk, general."&#xD;
With these words, the captain fell back to his&#xD;
place in front of his company.&#xD;
"Attention, you 'tarnal critters! .Rare 'up&#xD;
in your saddles-stick out your eyes to' the&#xD;
front, and look unspeakable ! To- the right&#xD;
about face-march/1"&#xD;
And the "'tarnal critters " retraced their&#xD;
steps to the spot where the roaddiverged which&#xD;
Forstall had taken. They galloped off in fine&#xD;
style, and the tall figure of Captain Nick tow-&#xD;
ered up like one of the famed giants of the&#xD;
'olden time.&#xD;
There is a ripple upon the smoothest sea, and&#xD;
some inharmony in all human proceedings, as&#xD;
was illustrated by the fate of the unhappy&#xD;
Jones ; for his colt became suddenly restive,&#xD;
was guilty of all sorts of 'antics, threw the sec-&#xD;
tions into confusion, and it was by the most&#xD;
desperate exertions that his rider maintained&#xD;
his seat.&#xD;
"What's your brute tryin' to dey now'&#xD;
inquired Captain Hawes.&#xD;
"He kicks up for'ard," replied 'ones.&#xD;

bile it down to a few words, cap'en," he added.&#xD;
"Feller-soldiers !" cried Captain Nick, wav-&#xD;
ing his sword, " glory is afore us, disgrace be-&#xD;
hinidus. Now's the time for -heroic deeds and&#xD;
gallant achievements., Half-a-dozen of you help&#xD;
Jones hold down that cussed colt. I aint goin'&#xD;
to make a long speech. I'm only going' to pile&#xD;
on a few specimints of nateral oratory, such as&#xD;
the occasion suggests.  The road is full of tories,&#xD;
and we're about to bust upon 'em like:an airth-&#xD;

to swing it ! Give it to 'em hard-cut right&#xD;

and I'll die on the ground afore I'll knock un-&#xD;

When I say 4alt, stop as though it was phy-&#xD;
sically onpossible to go any further ; and when&#xD;
I say charge, bust like some mighty convulsion&#xD;
of natur. Roller me, and keep still, till we git&#xD;
a view of 'em."&#xD;
The horsemen rode on at an easy pace until&#xD;
they had nearly reached the turn in the road,&#xD;
when the, captain motioned them to stop, and&#xD;
riding on a few yards farther, came in view of&#xD;
Cunningham and his men.&#xD;
"Keep back out of sight," said Hawes.&#xD;
"I want to see what they're about. You were&#xD;
right, Anderson ; the wretches are going' to&#xD;
string up a human being , and'I believe it's that&#xD;
young Forstall. Now if that isn't a scene to&#xD;
make a man's blood feel hot, I never saw one.&#xD;
I don't think I can contain my feelin's of. out-&#xD;
raged humanity much longer., We'll break&#xD;
upon 'em, sir, like a thunder clap ! Let's go&#xD;
back, and lead on our Bengal tigers, for you&#xD;
see they're all ready to murder him."&#xD;
When Hawes stood once more before his com-&#xD;
pany, his features were unusually stern, and he&#xD;
was biting his lips with rage.  He unsheathed&#xD;
&#xD;
61&#xD;
&#xD;
his sword with a-jerk, bent forward in his sad-&#xD;
dle, and exclaimed in a distinct though suppress-&#xD;
ed voice.:&#xD;
" They'e doin' Satan's own work out there,&#xD;
my brave fellers; they're going' to strangle a&#xD;
human specie-and one of Marion's Brigade'!&#xD;
Straighten up, you tarnal critters-give your&#xD;
horses the spurs till they sweat with pain-&#xD;
bear down on the miscreants as though you were&#xD;
all shot from the mouth of a mammoth mortar&#xD;
in a body. Strike as if you meant to cut&#xD;
through man and horse at a single blow. Steel&#xD;
your hearts, I tell you, to deeds of blood, and&#xD;
don't think of anything but victory and ven-&#xD;
geance. Rare up in your saddles-follow me&#xD;
like so many links of chain lightnin'."&#xD;
Captain Hawes struck his spurs deep into&#xD;
the sides of his horse ; every man of the com-&#xD;
pany followed his example, and with drawn&#xD;
sabres, and-brows contracted with frowns of&#xD;
deadly hate, thundered forward with irresistible&#xD;
impetuosity. They swept round the bend-&#xD;
their foes were in sight, and the next moment&#xD;
they charged through them with a dreadful&#xD;
shock.   Horses were overturned, and their&#xD;
riders crushed beneath them, while heavy sabres&#xD;
flashed like living fires over their heads,.cutting&#xD;
down their comrades with strokes that steel ar-&#xD;
mor could not have resisted.   So furious was&#xD;
the onset, and so headlong their speed, that&#xD;
they were carried some yards beyond the spot&#xD;
where the murder was being enacted ; but&#xD;
checking their maddened horses, they turned,&#xD;
obedient to the order of Hawes (whose voice&#xD;
was heard like the blast of a bugle), and char-&#xD;
ged back' upon the scattered and terrified&#xD;
wretches.&#xD;
" Strike hard, I tell you !" shouted the cap-&#xD;
tain, and set the example himself.&#xD;
The paralyzed senses of the tories began to&#xD;
recover their activity ; they drove their rowels&#xD;
into their horses' flanks,,and fled in every direc-&#xD;
tion, Cunningham and Gainey being among the&#xD;
foremost.&#xD;
Forstall was instantly freed from his perilous&#xD;
position ; the sharp sabre of Captain Nick cut&#xD;
his bands, and seizing a weapon, he joined in&#xD;

the pursuit of the flying dragoons. A sense of&#xD;
the outrage which had been offered him, nerved&#xD;
his hand and gave additional energy to pursuit.&#xD;
His horse sped 6n-like an arrow shot from the&#xD;
bow of an ancient highlander. Frank pressed&#xD;
hard upon a fugitive; he swung up his sabre ;&#xD;
but before it had descended, the tory turned&#xD;
back upon him a face pallid with terror, and he,&#xD;
recognized in the ashy features, one of the mis-&#xD;
creants who had been most active in arranging&#xD;
the preliminaries of execution.&#xD;
Forstall's heart swelled with a sense of the&#xD;
indignity that he had experienced ; he struck&#xD;

which the combined powers of all earthly surgery&#xD;

CIIAPTER XIII.&#xD;
THE TORY   RENDEZvOUS.   SAUL AMONG THE PROPHETS.&#xD;
&#xD;
T    HE tories were gathered at the place of&#xD;
rendezvous; they came riding to the spot&#xD;
by twos and threes, and in squads of half-a-dozen.&#xD;
The locale was a'judicious one for the purpose,&#xD;
being unfrequented and nearly surrounded by&#xD;
lage forests. Cyrus Dix was first on the&#xD;
ground, waiting impatiently for the coming of&#xD;
his comrades and brethren in. the royal cause.&#xD;
The idea of a captain's commission was still&#xD;
-uppermost among many thoughts- that crowded&#xD;
upon him. His mind aspired after authority,&#xD;
power and emolument. The cause which he had&#xD;
espoused was in the ascendant, and its ultimate&#xD;
triumph seemed certain ; and it was of little&#xD;
consequence to Dix whether it was based on the&#xD;
immutable foundation of right, or founded on&#xD;
the deepest quicksands of human wrong.&#xD;
His heart was elated with pride, as he be-&#xD;
held the people gathering around him. He felt&#xD;
that he was already a. leader, and was and&#xD;
would be acknowledged as such, although he&#xD;
had yet received no formal appointment from&#xD;
the legitimate source.&#xD;
But Cyrus Dix was in externals, so far as&#xD;
uniform was concerned, a captain; a coat of the&#xD;
&#xD;
prevailing style, as worn in the royal army,&#xD;
with epaulets and, other decorations, together&#xD;
with a sword, etc., marked him as a person hav-&#xD;
ing authority.&#xD;
Colonel Ferguson had promised to be at&#xD;
the gathering, and was punctual to the time.&#xD;
While the royalists were trooping to the rendez-&#xD;
vous, Dix was engaged in earnest conversation&#xD;
with the colonel. The condition of the coun-&#xD;
try, the speedy termination of the war, the best&#xD;
policy to be pursued, and kindred topics, were&#xD;
amply discussed.&#xD;
While the parties were thus engaged, a large&#xD;
and awkward youngman was observed by them&#xD;
walking from place to place, staring at every&#xD;
new-comer with dilated eyes.&#xD;
"Rather a verdant youth," remarked Fer-&#xD;
uuson, with a smile.&#xD;
"I have just been watching his movements,"&#xD;
replied Dix. "He's fresh from the bush,&#xD;
probably. I saw him  when he came, and he&#xD;
rode a very fine-looking horse."&#xD;
"His dress don't appear to be of the most&#xD;
recent style," said the colonel.&#xD;
"Somewhat rusty and antique," added Dix.&#xD;

I ask the name of so noble-looking an officer as&#xD;
you seem to be'?"&#xD;
"My surname is Ferguson, and I' am called&#xD;
colonel by those who call me," replied Ferguson,&#xD;
,mimicking the sing-song style of Dawson.&#xD;
"Then thou art that mighty man of valor of&#xD;
whom I have heard so much, and whose famne is&#xD;
trumpeted throughout all this land. Verily,&#xD;
thou art one of the valiant ones ; but I like not&#xD;
thy trade. And is it not written, friend Fer-&#xD;
guson, that those who take the sword shall per-&#xD;
ish by that same instrument of death'?"&#xD;
"Are there any whigs where you came from,&#xD;
honest Jotham'?" said the colonel, with much&#xD;
nonchalance.&#xD;
"Verily, friend Ferguson, they have been&#xD;
scattered abroad like sheep upon the mountains&#xD;
of Israel," replied "simple Jotham."&#xD;
"Did you ever hear of one Francis Marion,&#xD;
- pious Mr. Stebbins ?" continued the colonel.&#xD;
"I have heard of his deeds, and he's a man&#xD;
of blood," said " pious Stebbins."&#xD;
" Where is he now'?"&#xD;
"It hath been reported in my hearing, with-&#xD;
in the last hour, that he is in a large swamp on&#xD;
the Santee river, hard pressed by Major Wemyss,&#xD;
who hath resolved on his destruction," rejoined&#xD;
Dawson.&#xD;
" This is important news," said the colonel&#xD;
to Dix.&#xD;
"Question him farther,".answered the latter.&#xD;
" Do you think 'the report of Marion's&#xD;
being on the Santee, under the circumstances&#xD;
you have named, can be relied on, Mr. Steb&#xD;
bins'?" inquired Ferguson, earnestly.&#xD;
"Ihad it from one whom I consider as on&#xD;
of the salt of the -earth," was the reply.,&#xD;
" That's very favorable," said Dix to th&#xD;
colonel.  "There'll be no danger of our being&#xD;
disturbed here until we get ready to pounce&#xD;
upon the enemy, - and become ourselves th&#xD;
aggressors."&#xD;
"The best part of it all is that Wemyss i&#xD;
after him," replied the-officer.&#xD;
"Brother Parker, (who is also one of th&#xD;
salt)," i-esumed Dawson, " stood up and prop&#xD;
&#xD;
.ti^'"'' /&#xD;
&#xD;
esied (as it were) saying,' 'every soul of them&#xD;
shall be-cut off;' and this he spake not  of him;&#xD;
self, for he had received confidential news from&#xD;
a British officer, who knew all the particulars&#xD;
thereof."&#xD;
6 Very good, honest Jotham," responded the&#xD;
colonel.&#xD;
"If I heir anything more about Francis,&#xD;
shall I tell thee'?" inquired Dawson.&#xD;
"Of course, Jotham, by all means; but you&#xD;
must keep your mouth tight as a powder-horn&#xD;
in relation to what you see and hear at this&#xD;
place ; and as you are a stout, able-bodied fel-&#xD;
low, I advise you as a friend to join these royal&#xD;
and\peaceably disposed people in defending the&#xD;
rights of the excellent king, to whom these&#xD;
North' American provinces owe allegiance."&#xD;
"If I really thought it wasn't wrong !" said&#xD;
Job.&#xD;
Colonel Ferguson thereup6n assured him that&#xD;
it was not wrong.&#xD;
"I'll think of it, friend Ferguson," added&#xD;
Job; " and if I should conclude to go up to&#xD;
battle with the king's Israel, I shall assuredly&#xD;
smite the evil-doers, hip and thigh ; but not&#xD;
with carnal weapons ; for my soul loveth not&#xD;
the sound of the trumpet, and I have no pleas-&#xD;
ure in the neighing of war-steeds when they pre-&#xD;
pare themselves for the battle."&#xD;
. It was now the hour of sunset, and until twi-&#xD;
light had given place to night, the gigantic&#xD;
figure of Job Dawson was seen moving slowly&#xD;
about among the tories, staring at everything he&#xD;
saw with clownish curiosity. It might have&#xD;
- been remarked also, by a close observer, that&#xD;
the Quaker was often near Ferguson and Dix,&#xD;
e and though the parties spoken of frequently&#xD;
changed their position, he usually managed, al-&#xD;
e though in a manner calculated to appear wholly&#xD;
g incidental, to establish, the same relations be-&#xD;
e tween them and himself.&#xD;
e    It was natural that Cyrus Dix should be con-&#xD;
fidential with tihe colonel; he grew eminently&#xD;
s so. He even talked of Kate Mai tin, and re-&#xD;
lated the substance of his last interview with her&#xD;
e and her father. When Dix mentioned the pas-&#xD;

Dix answered that the report was -entirely disappeared from the tory rendzou;an.      h&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
RUTH A" MARY.&#xD;
&#xD;
ARY ADAIR recovered her, conscious-&#xD;
ness in a short time, and as she was&#xD;
still trembling with excitement, Ruth insisted&#xD;
that she should return instantly to the house.&#xD;
On the way thither, Mary related the particu-&#xD;
lars of what had just transpired-the sudden&#xD;
appearance of the tries, and the danger to&#xD;
which Hawthorne had been exposed. \&#xD;
"!Here is a secret for woman's curiosity to&#xD;
unravel," said Ruth, playfully. " Who is this&#xD;
Lewis Hawthorne, of'whom you have been&#xD;
speaking?"&#xD;
Mary Adair colored, and Miiss Strickland&#xD;
kindly forbore to press the subject. When the&#xD;
two young ladies had reached the house, the re-&#xD;
cent adventure was made known to Mrs. Strick-&#xD;
land, whohad been considerably alarmed by the&#xD;
tumult which she had heard without, knowing&#xD;
the exact position of affairs.&#xD;
While proper explanations were being made,&#xD;
and congratulations and inquiries exchanged,&#xD;
the parties were again, thrown into some excite-&#xD;
ment by the sound of prolonged shouting at'a&#xD;
considerable distance. . To hasten outside into&#xD;
tho open air, was an impulse quickly felt and&#xD;
obeyed by each,&#xD;
&#xD;
"I can see Cunningham's men," said Ruth."&#xD;
They are still near the spot where Lewis&#xD;
was in such danger, and where the man fell,"&#xD;
added Mary Adair.&#xD;
" There seems to be something unusually ex'&#xD;
citing taking place," remarked Mi's. Striekland,&#xD;
"'Let us walk forward in that direction."&#xD;
The parties proceeded a few hundred yards&#xD;
and again paused.&#xD;
"Perhaps," suggested Ruth, "they are in&#xD;
terring the body."&#xD;
" And it is po ible," added Mary, in an&#xD;
agitated voice, "that they have captured Lewis&#xD;
Hawthorne."&#xD;
" Heaven forbid I" exclaimed Mrs. Strick'&#xD;
land, "for those wretches show no mery."&#xD;
At that instant, Ruth uttered a piercing&#xD;
shriek, and clung to her mother convulsively&#xD;
for support. To the earnest inquiries of the&#xD;
latter, and the sympathizing Mary, she respond'&#xD;
ed only by sighs and tears. At length she was.&#xD;
able to exclaim&#xD;
"'Tis he ! 'tis he!"&#xD;
" 'Tis who'?" cried Mary, whoa Ruth's en-&#xD;
elamations had placed on-the rack of suspense,&#xD;

"Forstall !" replied Ruth, with a shudder.&#xD;
" Be calm, Ruth ; yield not to your terrors ;&#xD;
they may prove unfounded," said Mrs. Strick-&#xD;
land, firmly.&#xD;
"I should know him among a thousand," re-&#xD;
turned Ruth.   "I know I am not mistaken,"&#xD;
Mrs. Strickland and Miss Adair looked anx-&#xD;
iously and steadily towards the group of per-&#xD;
sons. Botdi felt sick at heart when their worst&#xD;
fears were confirmed. They beheld Forstall in&#xD;
that awful position where eternity seems to&#xD;
open upon the senses-so narrowed down are&#xD;
the limits of mortal existence-so brief the space&#xD;
between the two worlds.&#xD;
The beholders' cheeks grew pale, and they&#xD;
gazed into each other's eyes, and at Ruth, in&#xD;
speechless agony of spirit ; for it is a dreadful,&#xD;
spectacle t4 look upon the execution of a fellow-&#xD;
being under aly circumstances; and the pain&#xD;
is inconceivably enhanced when the sufferer is&#xD;
a friend, and, a martyr to some high and holy&#xD;
cause.&#xD;
Mrs, Strickland endeavored to shut out the&#xD;
fearftl scene from Ruth; but the latter put her&#xD;
gently aside, and strained her, eyes in the diree-,&#xD;
tionof ;the tragic proceedings. -&#xD;
. 4 Why..'do we remain here inactive !" she&#xD;
exclaimed, at length. - "-Why do we not lhasten&#xD;
forward;. andentreat the miscreants to spare his&#xD;
life ?"&#xD;
"Alas! before we could pass over half the&#xD;
distance, the horrible drama will be closed; the&#xD;
yong -man will be no more," 'returned the&#xD;
ntbee"&#xD;
-" But it is criminal-it is cruel to. do noth-&#xD;
ing for:him!:" ejaculated Ruth.         .&#xD;
"Let us pray, lRith," said her mother; in af&#xD;
soleinn tone.&#xD;
The three sank to their knees, as if actuated&#xD;
by i single will, 'and ,Mrs. Strickland prayed&#xD;
eainestly: and tearfully.-' She besought. the&#xD;
Father, if it were possible; to avert the im-&#xD;
pending fate of the young man; .but if it' o6uld&#xD;
not be thus, that he would graciously vouchsafe s&#xD;
to grant him an easy pasag6, and angelicac&#xD;

The low, fervent voice of prayer was inter-&#xD;
rupted by one louder and harsher than the clang&#xD;
of a brazen trumpet.&#xD;
"Straighten up, you tarnal critters ! Strike&#xD;
home, I tell you !"A&#xD;
The parties sprang to their feet and looked&#xD;
towards the spot from which they had just turn-&#xD;
ed with sickened hearts. What an unexpected&#xD;
sight met their astonished vision ! They saw a&#xD;
party of horsemen headed by a tall man, dash&#xD;
with the speed of lightning and the din of roll-&#xD;
ing thunder, into the group of tory misereantd,&#xD;
busy with the work of murder ; they beheld, as&#xD;
if by a divine interposition, the wretches scat.&#xD;
tered -and blasted before the impetuous onset of&#xD;
Captain Hawes.&#xD;
" Cut 'em down, I tell you !" shouted the&#xD;
leader, the tones of his stentorian voice echoing&#xD;
afar, making the hearts of his enemies quiver&#xD;
with the horror of death.'&#xD;
"Tarleton's quarters,* no mercy I" wethe&#xD;

Ruth pressed Mary's hand in silence, mod.&#xD;

added Mrs. Strickland.   "They are ' "   ing&#xD;

In a few moments not an enemy was to. =e&#xD;

proved himself a bold and intrepid leader.&#xD;

tain prudently remembered that he was to re-&#xD;
join the brigade as soon as possible, in order to&#xD;
be present at the anticipated surprise. His men&#xD;
were soon gathered about him, flushed with the&#xD;
pride and excitement of victory.&#xD;
" Neighbors and patriots !"  said Hawes.&#xD;
"You have done yourselves immortal honor,&#xD;
individually, respectively, and  collectively.&#xD;
The great heart of humanity will beat with new&#xD;
life, when the history of your gallant conduc-&#xD;
tions shall be generally promulgated throughout&#xD;
the airth, and at Rocky Creek, where many of&#xD;
you was cradled in. the' earliest stages of exis-&#xD;

in' news of an all-fired tussle !"&#xD;
"Jones is throwed again !" interrupted Cor-&#xD;
poral Higgins, as the captain paused to take&#xD;
breath. The military chieftain cast a reproach-&#xD;
ful look at the still misguided Jones.&#xD;
"I., hope nothin' will transpire," he said,&#xD;
"to mar the splendor of this afternoon's achieve-&#xD;
ments. Jones, if you must make an ass of&#xD;
yourself, do it when I aint makin' a speech.&#xD;
Pitchin' about in that way, is a bad habit to&#xD;

and throw no more double summersets in the&#xD;
ranks. Sergeant Davis, prick Jones a little&#xD;
with your toad-sticker. Mr. Forstall, I see&#xD;
you're lookin' all-sufficient wishful' to'ards that&#xD;
group of femernine specimints out yonder. I'll&#xD;
wait for you six minutes and a few seconds,&#xD;
while you go and give 'em your blessin'."&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
RIGADE:                                69&#xD;
Forstall gladly availed himself of this per-&#xD;
mission, and in a moment reined up his horse&#xD;
beside Ruth Strickland. Though still laboring&#xD;
under the excitement of the late proceedings,&#xD;
Forstall's old embarrassment returned as soon&#xD;
as he found himself in the presence of the maid-&#xD;
en in whom he felt so deep an interest.&#xD;
He shook warmly the proffered hand of the&#xD;
trio, and received their congratulations with&#xD;
emotions of pleasure not easily described.&#xD;
Notwithstanding he had so recently resigned&#xD;
himself to death, the love of life was never stron-&#xD;
ger in his bosom, than then; for there seemed&#xD;
to him something}unusually tender and friendly&#xD;
in the glances of Ruth.&#xD;
When a few words of general import had&#xD;
been exchanged, Mrs. Strickland remarked that&#xD;
it was necessary she' should immediately return&#xD;
to the house, and begged to be excused, trust-&#xD;
ing that Mary and her daughte? would more&#xD;
than make good her absence.&#xD;
The elder, lady walked away ; and in a mo-&#xD;
ment after, when Frank turned from Ruth to&#xD;
Miss Adair, he discovered that she was at a eon-&#xD;
siderable distance from him and his fair com-&#xD;
panion.&#xD;
Though the opportunity of being alone with&#xD;
theqinteresting being beside him, was what he&#xD;
had eagerly desired, yet when that condition&#xD;
actually existed, he was wholly unprepared to&#xD;
improve it. When Ruth perceived that her&#xD;
mother and Mary had suddenly vanished, she&#xD;
was painfully confused, for she feared that it&#xD;
might appear to Frank as a pre-arranged move-&#xD;
ment ; a supposition that would have proved&#xD;
very annoying to her, and very unjust.&#xD;
The young lady's confusion was cruelly con-&#xD;
tagious, and Forstall could not think of a single&#xD;
appropriate remark to hazard under the cir-&#xD;
cumstances. Contrary to the generally estab-&#xD;
lished precedent in such cases, the maiden was&#xD;
the first to break the silence, which had become&#xD;
awkwardly embarrassing.&#xD;
" A most fortunate escape," said Ruth.&#xD;
"Yes, perhaps, providential. I had given&#xD;
up all thoughts of deliverance from the unfor-&#xD;
tunate and ignominious position in which I was&#xD;

70                   MARION'S BRIGADE.&#xD;
&#xD;
placed," he replied, with considerable hesita-&#xD;
tion of manner,&#xD;
"Your friends will rejoice that so dreadful a&#xD;
tragedy was averted," added Ruth, moving&#xD;
slowly towards Mary Adair, and feeling most&#xD;
keenly that she was placed in a position that&#xD;
might easily be misconstrued. She resolved to&#xD;
prevent a possibility which would be so humi-&#xD;
liating, and instantly called to Miss Adair, say-&#xD;
ig that Mr. Forstall and herself desired her&#xD;
company; and Mary turned and came slowly&#xD;
towards them, apparently absorbed in her own&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;
"Miss Adair is a charming young lady, Miss&#xD;
Strickland, but when I have the happiness to&#xD;
be near you, I do not feel the want of other-&#xD;
other--."&#xD;
" Hurry up-hurry up !" shouted Captain&#xD;
Hawes. " I can't allow you but a few minutes&#xD;
longer. We've got to lick another township of&#xD;
tories to-night, you know."&#xD;
"You are aware that we have been acquainted&#xD;
for a long period, Miss Strickland, and that I&#xD;
naturally-naturally---"   ,&#xD;
Forstall stopped, and vainly endeavored to&#xD;
recall and embody the idea, which was in his&#xD;
mind when he commenced.&#xD;
To hide her own embarrassment, Ruth asked&#xD;
Frank if he knew Lewis Hawthorne; to which&#xD;
inquiry, he replied in the negative.&#xD;
"The times are so-so precarious, that it is&#xD;
very hard to tell when I may see you again, and&#xD;
therefore-therefore-" added Frank, failing&#xD;
entirely to come to the point.&#xD;
" Then you don't know Mr. Hawthorne ?"&#xD;
said Ruth.I&#xD;
&#xD;
"No," stammered Forstall, completely un-&#xD;
nerved.&#xD;
"I had hoped that the friendship that has&#xD;
subsisted-subsisted-"&#xD;
"In the excitement of the moment, I have&#xD;
neglected to refer to my father's imprisonment.&#xD;
Have you yet learned anything in relation to&#xD;
the general treatment and condition of the&#xD;
prisoners taken.at Camden ?" asked Ruth.&#xD;
" I have not yet been able to gather any in-&#xD;
formation, in regard to the prisoners, that would&#xD;
be of particular interest to you, but be assured&#xD;
that I have not yet forgotten the promise which&#xD;
I made at our last interview. It is probable&#xD;
that many of the unfortunates will be sent to&#xD;
Charleston  for safe- keeping.  Should Mr.&#xD;
Strickland be among th number, there's a&#xD;
prospect that something m y be done to set him&#xD;
at liberty ; an event which I greatly desire,&#xD;
because it will add to the happiness of one in&#xD;
whom-"&#xD;
" Come along, Forstall; we've straightened&#xD;
up to start !" shouted Captain Nick. " Give&#xD;
her your benediction, and don't let the gr s'&#xD;
grow under your horse's feet."&#xD;
"Farewell, Ruth," said Frank, reluctantly.&#xD;
"Mtost you go so soon ?" she asked.&#xD;
"Duty forces me from the spot where I would&#xD;
linger forever," answered Forstall, earnestly-&#xD;
- "Attention, the hull ! right about face 1"&#xD;
cried Hawes.&#xD;
Frank turned slowly from  Ruth, and she&#xD;
bade him adieu in a low voice.&#xD;
" March !" added the captain, and Forstall&#xD;
put spurs to his horse and galloped swiftly after&#xD;
the men of Rocky Creek.    A&#xD;

Kate related the story of her adventures to&#xD;
attentive auditors, partook of refreshments, and&#xD;
was about to retire, when an unexpected and&#xD;
painful scene occurred. There was a loud&#xD;
knocking at the outer door, and Mrs. Martin&#xD;
opened it. A man wearing the uniform of a&#xD;
subaltern officer entered, followed by ten or a&#xD;
dozen dragoons. Their entry was hurried and&#xD;
unceremonious, and their looks unprepossessing.&#xD;
Kate and her mother grew pale, but the pastor&#xD;
remained calm.&#xD;
" Your name is Martin ?" said the officer,&#xD;
interrogatively, and not-very courteously.&#xD;
" It is," he replied.&#xD;
"You're the man we're after," added the&#xD;
officer, laconically.           V&#xD;
"For what object ?" asked the pastor.&#xD;
"To punish you for your canting hypocrisy,"&#xD;
returned the man, impatiently.&#xD;
"In the long catalogue of my earthly sins, I&#xD;
believe that hypocrisy will not be found," re-&#xD;
turned Martin,&#xD;
"Lay hands on the sanctimonious villain !"&#xD;
exclaimed the officer.&#xD;
Several of the dragoons moved forward to&#xD;
execute the orders of their leader ; but Kate&#xD;
interposed her own person between her father&#xD;
and the ruffian crew, and commanded them to&#xD;
offer him no indignity, if they made any pre-&#xD;
tensions to the name of men and Christians.&#xD;
"Stand away, miss ; your advice aint wanted&#xD;
at present," added the leader, with a sneer,&#xD;
though not a little surprised at the beauty and&#xD;
heroisin of Kate.&#xD;
" By whose orders do you 'act ?" she asked,&#xD;
firmly.&#xD;
"By Colonel Ferguson's," replied the man.&#xD;
" Then return and tell him that you find here&#xD;
only defenceless females, and a' venerable ser-&#xD;
vant of God," rejoined Kate, energetically.&#xD;
"And get put under arrest for my trouble ?"&#xD;
said the leader, with a sneer.&#xD;
" It. is more manly to suffer wrong than to1&#xD;
perpetrate wrong," answered the maiden.&#xD;
" We didn't come here to hear' you or your&#xD;
father preach sermons, my pert damsel," re-&#xD;
&#xD;
BRIGADE.&#xD;
&#xD;
torted the officer. " Men, seize the rebel, and&#xD;
bind him."&#xD;
"Stand aside, my - dear Kate," said Mr.&#xD;
Martin, embracing her affectionately. " When&#xD;
we cannot resist injustice, we must suffer it with&#xD;
Christian meekness. I must submit to these&#xD;
men; no alternative remains.   Your earnest&#xD;
appeals will but provoke their malice. Soldiers,&#xD;
I am ready, like Paul, not only to be bound,&#xD;
but to die in the cause of truth and righteous-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
While the good pastor was speaking, he, gen-&#xD;
tly put Kate from him, and the dragoons in-&#xD;
stantly seized him.&#xD;
"Don't be afraid of hurting him !" exclaim-&#xD;
ed the officer.&#xD;
"Do not draw the cords qu- so tight, my&#xD;
good man," said the pastor to t e soldier who&#xD;
was tying his hands.&#xD;
" Tighter-tighter !" added t e leader, sav-&#xD;
agely ; "and he may thank his teirs that it is&#xD;
not his neck instead of his wri  ."   .   =l&#xD;
"What crime hath he eo mitted ?" asked&#xD;
Mrs. Martin, mildly.&#xD;
" A  reasonable question,  ruly !  His life&#xD;
would not atone for half th mischief he has'&#xD;
done. He has promulgated s pernicious sen-&#xD;
timents under the guise of r igion. His min-&#xD;
istry is the ministry of Satan  or of rebellion,&#xD;
which is the same thing. B his career is out&#xD;
short; you may depend on it, e will suffer ac-&#xD;
cording to his deserts."&#xD;
" Do your worst. 'I am prepared for all that&#xD;
I may be called upon to suffer in this cause,"&#xD;
remarked Martin, firmly.&#xD;
"Take that, then, if you will continue to&#xD;
whine and cant, and provoke me to anger i"&#xD;
cried the loyalist, striking him' with his sword.'&#xD;
"Insolent wretch !" exclaimed Kate, indig-&#xD;
nantly. "Is this your manhood ! is this your&#xD;
honor as a loyal officer ! Dare you strike a&#xD;
man whose hands are bound, and whose profes-&#xD;
sion forbids him'to fight, even were he on even&#xD;
terms with you?"&#xD;
" Not so fast, fair rebel; 'we're not done yet.&#xD;
If there's anything eatable and drinkable in the&#xD;
house, we want it."&#xD;

"We cannot minister to such miscreants !"   " Standin' or settin'?" inquired a fifth.&#xD;
exclaimed Mrs. 'Martin.                       "As we are ; here goes ! Long life to her,&#xD;

and no mistake !"&#xD;
" And mark the rest: He says that no&#xD;
violence must be offered the rebel prisoner ; and&#xD;
you'll be answerable, if there is," added Joe.&#xD;
" Hurry, you drunken rasgals !" said the&#xD;
officer.&#xD;
"The best thing you can do, sir. I'll help&#xD;
you get the prisoner mounted. Come, Mr.&#xD;
Martin," continued Joe, looking significantly&#xD;
at Kate, "mount, and be off with these flhe&#xD;
lads. The colonel wants to see you. Miss&#xD;
Martin, don't be a henderin' the king's men ;&#xD;
they have trouble enough, the Lord knows,&#xD;
without havin' foolish women gettin' in their&#xD;
way at sich times as these."&#xD;
Kate instantly fell back with a grateful look.&#xD;
at Joe, who thereupon assisted Mr. Martin out&#xD;
of the house, and to mount a horse. After&#xD;
some staggering and blustering, the dragoons&#xD;
succeeded in getting- into their saddles, and then&#xD;
rode away with their prisoner.&#xD;

"Do you think he is safe with them ?" asked&#xD;
Kate.&#xD;
Joe replied that they would 'not now dare&#xD;
offer him any violence, on account of the col-&#xD;
onel, of whom they stood much in fear.&#xD;
Kate then inquired if he had really been to&#xD;
the tory rendezvous.&#xD;
"Not at all," he replied. "I found out that&#xD;
mischief was going on, and made up the story to&#xD;
suit the occasion; and it has worked very well,&#xD;
for to-night Marion's Brigade will rescue him."&#xD;
Mrs. Martin and Kate did not neglect'to ex-&#xD;
press their heartfelt thanks to Sawyer for his&#xD;
timely aid; Kate felt that the adage was indeed&#xD;
true that kindness conferred never fails to re-&#xD;
ceive its reward.&#xD;
The dictates of gentle pity had constrained&#xD;
the young lady to interfere to save Joe's life,&#xD;
and already had his gratitude more than repaid&#xD;
the trouble the act had cost her.&#xD;

&#xD;
A T a late hour in the evening, Job Dawson&#xD;
was observed in conversation with Gen-&#xD;
eral Marion.   Frank Forstall. was standing&#xD;
near Ben Rowan, and improved the occasion to&#xD;
ask the latter if he had "pulverized " the Qua-&#xD;
ker recently. Ben did not greatly relish the&#xD;
question, and scowled rather ominously upon&#xD;
the questioner.&#xD;
"I know very well what you're comin' at,1'&#xD;
said Rowan, not very good naturedly ; "but&#xD;
you're much mistaken about that little affair.&#xD;
I'm sometimes troubled with a vertigo or dizzi-&#xD;
ness in the head, which seizes me awful sud-&#xD;
den, and knocks my pins right out from under&#xD;
me pand that accounts for my tumbling down&#xD;
so awkwardly that mornin' when I undertook to&#xD;
pulverize that humbug."&#xD;
"I was not aware that vertigo affected the-&#xD;
legs, particularly," answered Forstall.&#xD;
"I calkerlate-to make you aware of it, sir I"&#xD;
retorted Ben, rolling up his sleeves rather&#xD;
menacingly. " I've borne this sort of thing&#xD;
long enough ; and .I aint goin' to be made the&#xD;
laughing stock of the whole 'brigade, just be-&#xD;
cause my foot slipped when I was about to fetch&#xD;
&#xD;
him a lick that would have loosened all his&#xD;
teeth."&#xD;
" I understood you that it was a case of real&#xD;
vertigo," remarked Frank.&#xD;
"I didn't say vertigo ; I said apoplexy ; and&#xD;
I have been subject to it at times, more or less,&#xD;
on an average, off and on, from infancy, if not&#xD;
longer ; and I'll pulverize any man that makes&#xD;
fun of sich an infirmity, or disputes the fact by&#xD;
word or look," returned Ben, decidedly,&#xD;
"It's a great pity you happened to be seized&#xD;
at that particular moment," observed Mr. Hen-&#xD;
derson.&#xD;
"I didn't say-I was seized  I was a goin' to&#xD;
strike him, but.he stepped aside, I missed my&#xD;
aim, and the force of the blow threw me down.&#xD;
But you don't seem to understand it, and what's&#xD;
more, don't want to ; but one thing is sartain ;&#xD;
the man as don't believe, has got to stand up&#xD;
face to face with Ben Rowan !" cried the boxer,&#xD;
with increasing energy.&#xD;
"It wasn't apoplexy after all, then," added&#xD;
Henderson.&#xD;
"I never said it was; it's plain to see that&#xD;
you want to get up a quarrel, and the quicker&#xD;

&#xD;
the thing comes off, the better ; so come on, on&#xD;
or two at a time, just as you like, and I'll pu&#xD;
verize the lot."&#xD;
Ben put himself in an attitude of defence&#xD;
and looked very formidable.&#xD;
"I can't fight that way,"   said Forstall&#xD;
"and I couldn't. fight my good friend, Be&#xD;
Rowan, on any account." ,&#xD;
"hBesides," added Henderson, seriously, "yo&#xD;
had better finish Job Dawson, before you ge&#xD;
any more of that kind of work on hand."&#xD;
"You're cowards !"   exclaimed Ben.   "-&#xD;
believe you'll run to-night, when you see th&#xD;
enemy's camp-fires,  As for that Quaker, you'r&#xD;
in league with him. But I've not done witl&#xD;
him yet ; I'll pulverize him, if it takes me hal&#xD;
a day.- I shouldn't wonder if he proved to b&#xD;
a spy from the enemy; he's been gone all th&#xD;
afternoon, nobody knows where, and if the&#xD;
truth was known,-General Marion is a little sus&#xD;
picious of him, for he's eyin' him mighty sharj&#xD;
now."&#xD;
The individual referred to at that moment&#xD;
left Marion and approached the parties who had&#xD;
made him the subject of conversation.  The&#xD;
sabre, which was not by his side the last time&#xD;
the reader saw him, now swung at its accustom-&#xD;
ed place.     .1.,&#xD;
It amused Forstall and Henderson not a lit-&#xD;
tie, to see the contemptuous manner which Ben&#xD;
Rowan still maintained towards him.&#xD;
"How do you find yourself, friend Dawson ?"&#xD;
asked Henderson.&#xD;
"I never was lost, friend John," replied Job,&#xD;
with much simplicity.&#xD;
" Rowan has been explaining to us about&#xD;
that affair which happened between you and him&#xD;
a few mornings since. - We all, it seems, have&#xD;
labored under a mistake, not knowing that Ben's:&#xD;
unlucky fall was occasioned by an apoplectic&#xD;
fit," said Forstall; with an air of seriousness.&#xD;
"I didn't say a fit, but afalling sickness!"&#xD;
exclaimed Ben, angrily.&#xD;
" Thou art right, good Benjamin; it was a&#xD;
falling sickness, if thou wilt," answered Job.&#xD;
"rHear that-he -owns it !" cried Ben,&#xD;
triumphantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
Le   "It's all right, then," added Henderson -&#xD;
1- "and I hope you and Dawson will now shake&#xD;
hands."&#xD;
e, " I have no ill feeling towards friend Benja-&#xD;
min," said Job.&#xD;
, " Shake hands, then," returned Henderson.&#xD;
S" See what I'll do to him," whispered Ben&#xD;
to Forstall. "Perhaps I wont crush the bones&#xD;
u in his hand. A I dare say not ! Look out for&#xD;
t fun !"&#xD;
"Here is my hand, good Benjamin," said&#xD;
I Job, mildly, extending .his broad palm.&#xD;
e    " Well, I don't care," replied Ben, " since&#xD;
e you acknowledge that I was not vanquished by&#xD;
h mortal strength, but by disease, I'll give you&#xD;
f my fist on it ; so here goes."&#xD;
e   Rowan seized Dawson's hand, and pressed it&#xD;
e with all his strength, expecting that the latter&#xD;
- would cry out with, pain, and a laugh would be&#xD;
- produced at his expense.&#xD;
"Verily," said Dawson, "I like a warm and&#xD;
friendly grasp, and I am glad to put an end to&#xD;
this misunderstanding. Therefore let this cor-&#xD;
dial grasp convince you that I cherish no kardc&#xD;
feelings towards you."&#xD;
While the Quaker was making these remarks,,&#xD;
he closed his mighty hand upon Ben's, and the&#xD;
fingers sunk into the flesh like iron rods. Row-&#xD;
an's whole frame quivered with pain ; but he&#xD;
stood like a martyr, waiting with what fortitude&#xD;
he could muster, for the moment of release.&#xD;
"Art thou satisfied, good Benjamin ?" kind-&#xD;
ly inquired Dawson, shaking Rowan's power-&#xD;
less hand still more vehemently.&#xD;
" I-I-am-it--it is all-all right," repli-&#xD;
ed the boxer, 'his face growing dreadfully red,&#xD;
while his eyes gave abundant indications of being&#xD;
uncommonly watery.&#xD;
" It is a- good thing, Benjamin, for a man. to&#xD;
be fully persuaded in his own, mind," added&#xD;
Dawson, still tightening his grip.  "I hope&#xD;
you are really in earnest about this matter, and&#xD;
that this friendly pressure of hands is without&#xD;
deceit."&#xD;
" Yes--yes !" exclaime' Ben, dancing round&#xD;
Job like a young grisly bear caught in a steel&#xD;

" I think the plan will do very well," re-&#xD;
marked Ferguson.&#xD;
"I certainly hope so, colonel, for I am great-&#xD;
ly attached to the girl," replied Dix.&#xD;
"You could not probably appear in a more&#xD;
interesting character than that of a benefactor,"&#xD;
added the officer.&#xD;
"V hery  true, colonel; for  Kate Martin&#xD;
idolizes her father," said Dix.&#xD;
" You have only to step forward then, at the&#xD;
proper. moment and befriend him, to win her&#xD;
eternal gratitude, if you have not already se-&#xD;
cured her esteem," replied Ferguson. " The&#xD;
affair may *be very well managed in this way.&#xD;
In the morning you can repair to Mr. Martin's,&#xD;
seemingly ignorant that the peace of the family&#xD;
has in any way been disturbed. You will be-&#xD;
come indignant when you hear the story from&#xD;
the rosy lips of your enchantress, and mouth&#xD;
some pretty round oaths to give your anger&#xD;
reality. In the midst of your virtuous fury,&#xD;
you will hear the bugles of my detachment, and&#xD;
upon looking from the window, will see me pass-&#xD;
ing the house with my prisoner seated on horse-&#xD;
back in the midst of us, securely guarded. In&#xD;
a moment you rush from the dwelling, and un-&#xD;
sheathing your sword, plant yourself in the road&#xD;
&#xD;
g directly before us, and swear by all that is&#xD;
1 great and praiseworthy, that we shall ride over&#xD;
e your body, if we advance, unless we release&#xD;
the prisoner without harming his sacred person."&#xD;
" Wont something; like this do?" said Dix,&#xD;
s drawing his weapon with a theatrical flourish.&#xD;
" Hold ! forbear-if ye be men ! In the name&#xD;
of justice and humanity, release that venerable&#xD;
man ! Hold,1say!"&#xD;
"Very good," replied the colonel; and then&#xD;
both -laughed immoderately.  "I, of Bourse,&#xD;
will release the rebel; the daughter will fall at&#xD;
your feet, and invoke all manner of. blessings&#xD;
upon your magnanimous soul; then she is yours&#xD;
for life."&#xD;
" Excellent ! excellent !" cried Cyrus Dix,&#xD;
in great glee.  "I must rehearse my part a few&#xD;
times."&#xD;
"Infernal rascal !" muttered Henderson,&#xD;
between his teeth.&#xD;
"Hold ! forear-in the king's name /"&#xD;
exclaimed Dix, going through with his part&#xD;
again, and once more indulging in a burst of&#xD;
boisterous laughter.&#xD;
We'll show you some acting more effectual&#xD;
than that, my fine fellow !" said Forstall, in a&#xD;
whisper.&#xD;
" The surest way to a damsel's heart is to&#xD;
play the hero," resumed Ferguson; "and you&#xD;
will certainly appear a real one-a Christian,&#xD;
philanthropist, and soldier, all combined."&#xD;
The parties now turned and walked from the&#xD;
spot where Forstall and Henderson were con-&#xD;
cealed, Dix occasionally stopping to go through&#xD;
with his part of the projected farce ; an opera-&#xD;
tion that did not fail to provoke a fresh burst&#xD;
of merriment.&#xD;
"It's time for us to be going," said Hender-&#xD;
son, in an agitated voice, when the colonel and&#xD;
his companion had passed. from hearing. - "I&#xD;
have heard and seen enough."   .&#xD;
The two young men arose and returned to&#xD;
the brigade, with the observance of the same&#xD;
cautiousness that had characterized their going&#xD;
forth.&#xD;

&#xD;
" He means to disgrace himself," said th&#xD;
captain.&#xD;
"Let each man do his best," added Marion&#xD;
"and in ten minutes our enemies will be flying&#xD;
from the field, or fertilizing it with their blood.'&#xD;
Marion's eyes sparkled with animation, an&#xD;
his sword flashed in the pale beams of the new&#xD;
ly risen moon. Touching his horse with hi:&#xD;
armed heel, he bent forward in the saddle, and&#xD;
his noble charger shot away towards the camp&#xD;
fires of the enemy, followed by stern and reso&#xD;
lute men, who feared not thebrunt of battle, nor&#xD;
the thunder of war.&#xD;
" Come on, you tarnals!"    cried Hawes.&#xD;
"Give it to 'em unspeakable. Make 'em think&#xD;
all natur has busted, and chaos has come agin,&#xD;
knocking' all temporary consarns into eternal&#xD;
smash. Rare up ! swing your cuttin' instru-&#xD;
ments !"&#xD;
- Frank Forstall noticed as they swept on, that&#xD;
quiet Job Dawson was in his place beside Ben&#xD;
Rowan;   his great horse was snorting   and&#xD;
plunging, and champing the steel bit, as if im-&#xD;
patient to mingle in the melee.&#xD;
" What a furious beast !" remarked Frank&#xD;
to Ben.&#xD;
"Just sich another humbug as his rider !"&#xD;
returned Rowan, tartly.&#xD;
Mark his arching neck and his fiery eyes !"&#xD;
exclaimed Forstall.&#xD;
"Bah !" was the not very flattering res-&#xD;
ponse of the irascible boxer.&#xD;
During this time, Dawson sat easily and&#xD;
gracefully in his saddle, his monster sabre swing-&#xD;
ing at his side.&#xD;
"If you don't intend to fight, Mr. Dawson,&#xD;
there's still a chance for you to get from the&#xD;
ranks," said Forstall.&#xD;
I am a man of peace," replied Job, " but&#xD;
the man Francis hath commanded me to go up&#xD;
to battle, and I go as a sheep to the slaughter,&#xD;
and as a lamb dumb before the shearer."&#xD;
There was no time for farther conversation,&#xD;
for they were now close upon the tory rendez-&#xD;
vous, and their speed had increased to a wild&#xD;
and furious gallop. Marion's terrible war-cry&#xD;
rang out with startling energy upon the air :&#xD;
&#xD;
e Liberty or Death ! It fell upon the ears of the&#xD;
royalists like a dread summons to the eternal&#xD;
, world.  They sprang towards their horses, but&#xD;
g before half of them were in the saddle, Marion&#xD;
had reached them   and blasted their forming-&#xD;
I ranks like the destroying lightnings of heaven.&#xD;
- Those heavy sabres came down, cleaving skulls,&#xD;
s hewing bodies with frightful gashes, and lop-&#xD;
I ping off limbs. Loud cries of terror, dreadful&#xD;
- wails of agony, fiendish yells of rage, the clash-&#xD;
- ing of swords, the discharge of fire-arms, and the'&#xD;
thunder of horses' hoofs, shook the field of con-&#xD;
flict.  Ferguson shouted to his dragoons to&#xD;
rally around him and disperse the rebels; some&#xD;
heard and attempted to obey, while many sought&#xD;
safety in flight.&#xD;
Forstall had resolved to mark the bearing of&#xD;
those about him in the hour of battle, especially-&#xD;
of Dawson and Henderson. The latter, he now&#xD;
saw galloping from one part of the field to&#xD;
another in search of Cyrus Dix. As for Daw-&#xD;
son, he had kept near him until they had charg-&#xD;
ed through the enemy, at which time he ob-&#xD;
served that his mammoth steed was in advance&#xD;
of all-others, and growing more furious every&#xD;
moment; but the rider was still self-possessed.&#xD;
Ben Rowan perceived that the Quaker was&#xD;
foremost, and resolving not to be outdone, spur-&#xD;
red madly after hiin, and Frank imitated his&#xD;
example.&#xD;
Ferguson's dragoons had hastily formed in&#xD;
the rear of the broken line ; their muskets now&#xD;
bristled in the faces of Captain Logan's com-&#xD;
pany, and Job Dawson seemed rushing madly&#xD;
upon their gleaming points.&#xD;
Forstall wondered whether he saw them, or&#xD;
whether his horse was urging him on against&#xD;
his will. He saw Job grasp his sabre, and rise&#xD;
in his stirrups ; the next moment a sheet of&#xD;
flame, and a stream of lead leaped from the&#xD;
ranks of Ferguson's dragoons, and Dawson was&#xD;
enveloped in smoke and hidden from view.&#xD;
Frank involuntarily exclaimed "poor Job,"&#xD;
and never expected to see him again ; but the&#xD;
stern and bloody work before him now engaged&#xD;
all his attention, for Ferguson's men made an&#xD;
obstinate resistance.&#xD;

" The tumult of life has passed, and I hope&#xD;
it is well with them now," returned Frank.&#xD;
"I most fervently hope so," answered Hen-&#xD;
derson. The parties paused a moment beside&#xD;
some bodies that had been shockingly crushed&#xD;
by horses' feet.&#xD;
"Is it not lamentable that the passions of&#xD;
men work out such accomplished horrors as&#xD;
these ?" said Forstall.&#xD;
"Lamentable indeed; and yet war has pre-&#xD;
vailed in all countries, and in all ages of which&#xD;
we have any history."&#xD;
" Very true," said a voice near them; "and&#xD;
yet you would not argue that the fact furnishes&#xD;
us any excuse or justification for the barbarous&#xD;
practices of war?"&#xD;
Henderson turned towards the speaker and&#xD;
recognized Mr. Martin.&#xD;
"You are right, reverend sir ; I would not,"&#xD;
"I find it impossible to content myself here&#xD;
until the morning," added the pastor. "It&#xD;
may not be perfectly safe to attempt to return,&#xD;
&#xD;
home ; but I know my friends are deeply and&#xD;
sleeplessly anxious for-my safety."&#xD;
"I can very well understand the nature of&#xD;
your feelings," said Henderson ; "yet I doubt&#xD;
whether you could safely return to the settle.&#xD;
meant at this hour, for you might possibly fall&#xD;
into the hands of some of our loyalist friends&#xD;
again, in which event, I fear you would fare&#xD;

"There is a small foot-path through the&#xD;
woods to the settlement, which I can find, I&#xD;
doubt not, and which is but half the distance of&#xD;
the usual way ; by following that, I do not think&#xD;
I shall incur much risk," returned Martin.&#xD;
" If you are resolved to go, I will accompany&#xD;
you," said Henderson.&#xD;
"And I also," added Frank.&#xD;
Mr. Martin expressed his gratitude for these&#xD;
kind offers, and the 'parties immediately set&#xD;

ed and withered our fellows like autumn&#xD;

"I heard the sound of musketry not long&#xD;
ago," replied Kate, calmly.&#xD;
" The idea has occurred to me, Kate Martin,&#xD;
that we were betrayed. I have had within the&#xD;
last hour strong suspicions."&#xD;
." And of whorm, Captain Dix ?" asked Kate.&#xD;
"Of you," he answered emphatically.&#xD;
"What a strange idea," said Kate, quietly.&#xD;
" Yes, we have been betrayed ; we have&#xD;
been routed ; we have been hacked to pieces !"&#xD;
exclaimed Dix, walking across the floor, greatly&#xD;
excited, and stamping his foot to give emphasis&#xD;
to his remarks.&#xD;
"You do not seem.to be hacked seriously,"&#xD;
remarked Kate.&#xD;
"If I knew that you had fooled me !" re-&#xD;
turned Dix, striking his fist violently upon the&#xD;
table near which he happened to stand at that&#xD;
instant.&#xD;
"Do you know anything of the fate of my&#xD;
husband ?" asked Mrs. Martin..&#xD;
He's at liberty, long before this time,"&#xD;
muttered Dix, appending some kind of a strange&#xD;
oath in a still lower tone.&#xD;
"If I remember rightly, Captain Dix," re-&#xD;
sumed Kate, accenting the title which she al-&#xD;
most invariably affixed to the tory's name, " you&#xD;
said something about your power to protect my&#xD;
father."&#xD;
"I did intend to do so, and my plans were&#xD;
all arranged," was the reply.&#xD;
" They were indeed, as I can bear witness,"&#xD;
whispered Henderson.&#xD;
"Your Tromise was broken, for he came near&#xD;
being murdered by the ruffians who came to&#xD;
tear him from his home, last night, by your or-&#xD;
ders, doubtless," remarked Mrs. Martin.&#xD;
" What do: you intend to. do now, all your&#xD;
plans having so signally failed ?" inquired&#xD;
Kate.&#xD;
"Rally again--rally again ; what else can&#xD;
be done?"       ,&#xD;
" Marion's Brigade will be sure to find you,"&#xD;
observed Mrs. Martin.&#xD;
&#xD;
Dix replied by invoking a heavy curse upon&#xD;
the heads of Marion's dragoons. .&#xD;
"Kate," he said, abruptly, after a short&#xD;
silence, "you know my feelings towards you,&#xD;
and I desire before I leave you, to know some-&#xD;
thing more of yours towards me.'&#xD;
"What, before my mother ?" said Kate, in&#xD;
a playful voice.&#xD;
"She has been young-,-the ways of youth-&#xD;
ful damsels are well known to her," replied&#xD;
Dix. "Time, presses, Kate ; I am  expecting&#xD;
to hear every moment the sound of Marion's&#xD;
dragoons."&#xD;
" It were wrong to keep you waiting to hear&#xD;
a silly girl express her sentiments," rejoined&#xD;
Kate, "but I will speak them   in part, that&#xD;
your departure may be instant, and that we may&#xD;
understand each other in all future time. My&#xD;
feelings towards you-"  Kate paused.&#xD;
"Don't be timid," said Dix, encouragingly.&#xD;
"You can whisper it in my ear, if you will. I&#xD;
only desire to know on what terms we are to&#xD;
meet hereafter."&#xD;
"My feelings towards you," returned Kate,&#xD;
I do not fear to speak aloud and openly. I&#xD;
do consider you, without any exception, the&#xD;
most contemptible villain I ever met with."&#xD;
Kate uttered these words with a vehemence.&#xD;
that left no doubt on the minds of her hearers&#xD;
of her perfect sincerity.&#xD;
The tory remained mute and motionless;&#xD;
surprise.had stricken him a heavy blow. So&#xD;
deep was the silence that prevailed for a moment&#xD;
within; that the listeners could distinctly hear&#xD;
the monotonous ticking of the clock, on the'&#xD;
mantle.&#xD;
" I believe the rascal is annihilated,"..re-&#xD;
marked Forstall, in a whisper.&#xD;
" Who wouldn't be, to hear such a sentence&#xD;
pronounced upon him from such lips," returned&#xD;
Henderson.&#xD;
"Cheated-deceived-fooled!" gasped Dix,&#xD;
faintly, " By heavens, this crushes me-it cuts&#xD;
like Marion's sabres. A thousand withering&#xD;
maledictions on woman's infernal arts !"&#xD;
"You' should have known me better than to&#xD;
attempt to wimimy esteem by creeping hypocrisy.&#xD;
&#xD;
MARION'S&#xD;
&#xD;
I detest your person, your conduct, and your c&#xD;
cause;" retorted Kate,                    ' t&#xD;
"My daughter's sentiments are also mine," l&#xD;
said Mrs. Martin. " And now that you know&#xD;
us, I trust that we shall see your face no more." t&#xD;
" I'm unnerved--the pang is sharp-but it n&#xD;
is but momentary !" exclaimed. Dix, struggling t&#xD;
to gain control of his feelings. "You have t&#xD;
fooled me cruelly, but I will remember it--I t&#xD;
will triumph yet !"       -a&#xD;
'' Just rehearse a few words of the part he c&#xD;
was to act on this very spot," whispered Mr. o&#xD;
Martin to Henderson.                         t&#xD;
"A capital idea," said Forstall.&#xD;
"Is it not best to capture him ?" asked Hen- i&#xD;
derson.-&#xD;
"By all means; we will rush in immediately t&#xD;
after you have gone through with the pretty lit=,&#xD;
fle speech he was to make before Ferguson's&#xD;
dragoons," rejoined Frank.                   1&#xD;
"Though cut up and scattered, our courage&#xD;
is not broken," resumed Dix.     " We shall t&#xD;
gather again in greater numbers, and then you 1&#xD;
shall'feel my power."&#xD;
Dix gave greater emphasis to these words by&#xD;
striking his foot upon the floor.&#xD;
" Hold-forbear-in the king's name ! for&#xD;
the sake of humanity !" shouted Henderson, in.&#xD;
a voice highly tragical and effective.&#xD;
The parties stared with surprise. . Cyrus Dix&#xD;
recoiled to the wall and glared, fiercely around&#xD;
him.  But there' was no time to waste ; for&#xD;
steps were heard without, and the latch was&#xD;
hurriedly lifted. Dix instantly leaped through&#xD;
a window, shivering sash and glass, and by 'the&#xD;
time Henderson and Forstall gained the middle&#xD;
of the room, he was heard galloping away.&#xD;
"The bird has flown, gentlemen," said the&#xD;
pastor, with a smile.&#xD;
".This is indeed a pleasant surprise 1" ex-&#xD;
claimed Mrs. Martin.'&#xD;
"But a surprise, nevertheless," cried Kate,&#xD;
embracing her father.&#xD;
Forstall was instantly introduced to the ladies,&#xD;
and Hendersonvwarmly greeted by them. Frank&#xD;
confessed to himself that the pastor's  daughter&#xD;
was exceedingly fair.  After a few moments of&#xD;

onversation, such as the exciting condition of&#xD;
things naturally suggested, our two friends took&#xD;
eave and returned to the camp.&#xD;
The following day the Brigade marched back&#xD;
o Lynch's Creek. The name of Marion had&#xD;
ow become a terror to evil doers, and began&#xD;
o be spoken of with admiration in all parts of&#xD;
he country, while he received daily accessions&#xD;
o his numbers. Hisdaring deeds excited the&#xD;
attention of the Royal army, and the British&#xD;
ommander perceived that it was necessary, in&#xD;
rder to the final subjugation of South Carolina,&#xD;
hat his career should be stopped.&#xD;
About this period flaming proclamations were&#xD;
issued, full of dire invectives against those who&#xD;
continued rebellious, and seming with promises&#xD;
to those who submitted humbly to British usur-&#xD;
pation. Those capable of bearing arms, who&#xD;
would not hasten to the royal standard, were to&#xD;
be imprisoned, and their property confiscated;&#xD;
and every militia man who had borne arms with&#xD;
them, and afterwards joined the patriots, was&#xD;
to be immediately hanged, if eptured.&#xD;
In consequence of these documents, many&#xD;
persons were put to death, and many families&#xD;
deprived of their substance. - But acts of this&#xD;
nature provoked the suffering people beyond&#xD;
endurance, an compelled many to arms with'&#xD;
the firm determination to conquer or perish on&#xD;
the field of battle. Men stung to madness by&#xD;
wrong and injustice made excellent soldiers,&#xD;
and with such leaders as Marion, Sumter, Me-&#xD;
Clure and Davies, could not fail to give a bright-&#xD;
er aspect to the cause of freedom.&#xD;
The British arms being victorious at Charles-&#xD;
ton and Camden, and British posts being estab-&#xD;
lished in various sections of the country, it was&#xD;
vastly easy for the tories to show their might,&#xD;
and manifest their deadly hostility to the whigs.&#xD;
It was but a few days after till Cunningham's&#xD;
defeat before he was again at the head of a des-&#xD;
perate band of cut-throats, committing cruelties&#xD;
at which the heart of decent humanity revolts.&#xD;
But the "Bloody Scout," learning a little wis-&#xD;
dom from past punishments, was cautious in its&#xD;
movements, fearing lest' Marion should 'surprise&#xD;
and cut them in pieces, in some unexpected&#xD;
moment.&#xD;

MAX ION'S BRIGADE.&#xD;
&#xD;
One evening,'a few days after the affair at&#xD;
Booky Creek, a negro riding a fiery horse was&#xD;
brought into camp by the sergeant of the guard.&#xD;
He refused to tell his business to any one, but&#xD;
obstinately persisted to see General Marion.&#xD;
When conducted to the presence of that officer&#xD;
he shook his head and looked at him incred-&#xD;
ulously.&#xD;
"This is the general," said the sergeant.&#xD;
"Dat am doubtful!" muttered the African,&#xD;
in a low voice. "Dey say he am mighty great&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"Hush, youfool! not great in person but in&#xD;
deeds," whispered, the sergeant.      ,&#xD;
"This colored fellow says he has something&#xD;
to communicate," aided the latter, touching&#xD;
his cap, aitd addressing Marion.&#xD;
4"If you is de gin'ral, he hab communicated&#xD;
de nature ob de circumstance," said Cuffee,&#xD;
bdwing, and doffing his hat.-&#xD;
"I am; what have you to say, my lad?" re-&#xD;
joined Marion, in his 'usual mild and affable&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
The negro hesitated, and seemed to be still&#xD;
in doubt.&#xD;
" Dis chile am bery particerler,"kaae de'ti mes&#xD;
am bery vicarious," he stammered.&#xD;
"Who sent you, sir?" inquired the general,&#xD;
somewhat sharply.&#xD;
a Beryfine missus-one great'lady, massa,"&#xD;
was the reply..    ,&#xD;
"Ahi a;lady in the case.   Well, I like&#xD;
that," observed Marion, pleasantly.&#xD;
"I am de post office as she sent dis writin'&#xD;
by," added the negro, displaying letter.&#xD;
" Is it directed to me'?" said the general.&#xD;
Am Francis de ntial ob your fuss name&#xD;
co tinued Cuffee, cautiously.,&#xD;
" It is," returned the general, with a smile.&#xD;
"And does de letters ob yqur last name be-&#xD;
gin wid a great M, and end ,wid a little n and&#xD;
a flourish?" continued the negro.&#xD;
"Exaotly," answered the general.&#xD;
-"And finally, massea, does de initial of dis&#xD;
plaoe begin wid Lynch's Creek, and a pot hook&#xD;
you could 'hang your hat on?" added Cuflee,"&#xD;
with inreasing confidence.    -&#xD;
&#xD;
"You have described it precisely," exclaimed&#xD;
ie general, good naturedly.&#xD;
" Den it am all right. I hab de honor.to&#xD;
present is writing' to ,General Marion, who am&#xD;
arter do royalists and de crown ob England, like&#xD;
de footsteps) ob death when' he takes arter de&#xD;
poor plantation niggers."&#xD;
Marion took the letter and glanced at the&#xD;
superscription. The letter was written in an&#xD;
elegant hand, and the chirography obviously&#xD;
that of a female.&#xD;
" This is, from a fair lady, then," he said,&#xD;
musingly.&#xD;
"Her eyes am like de stars dat lumernate de&#xD;
cannister of heben," remarked the negro, poet.&#xD;
ically.  -&#xD;
"Indeed !". replied Marion, mechanically,&#xD;
opening the'letter-&#xD;
" It am faek, and dis ehile know ob British&#xD;
ossifers as tink it am a privilege to kiss anyting&#xD;
her white.land hab touched," added the negro,,&#xD;
apparently not a little shocked and displeased&#xD;
at the irreverent manner' with which he broke&#xD;
the seal of the neatly folded missive. U&#xD;
Without heeding Cufee's last remark, the&#xD;
general proceeded to examine the contents of&#xD;
the' letter. It was dated at " Nelson's Ferry,"&#xD;
and read as follows :-&#xD;
- I " GENERAL MARION :--The wanton barbar-&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
FORSTALL AND HENDERSON wITH THE TORIES--ELDAD TEWKSBURY.&#xD;
-&#xD;
&#xD;
' T was quite late in the evening when Ben&#xD;
Rowan . touched Frank Forstall on the&#xD;
shoulder, and told him that General Marion de-&#xD;
sired his presence.0&#xD;
Our hero instantly complied with the sum-&#xD;
mons, and as he entered the tent, met Job'&#xD;
Dawson going out. 'rank found the general&#xD;
absorbed in thought, and an open letter lying&#xD;
beside him.&#xD;
"I have selected you," said Marion,,after a&#xD;
moment of silence, " to perform a duty attended&#xD;
with considerable danger."&#xD;
Forstall bowed, and the general went on.&#xD;
"Should you consider the undertaking too&#xD;
difficult and perilous, you are at liberty to de-&#xD;
-line it altogether."&#xD;
"I' accept it beforehand,, unconditionally,&#xD;
and without explanation," replied the young&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"I did not estimate your courage and spirit&#xD;
too highly, I perceive," resumed Marion, "and&#xD;
I will come to the point at once.   I wish to&#xD;
know what the tories are doing on the Pedee,&#xD;
* After the war, a lady of wealth, who "lovedhim&#xD;
for the dangers he had passed," disclosed.the state of&#xD;
her affections to some persons, who were the mutual&#xD;
friends of either party, and Marion being made-aware&#xD;
of the impression he had made upon theheart of. this&#xD;
lady, solicited her hand, and was accepted. The&#xD;
name of the lady was Miss Mary Videau,,whose an-&#xD;
cestors, like his own, were-among the luugaenots that&#xD;
sought liberty of conscience on the shores of America,&#xD;
being denied that inestimable privilege in the land of&#xD;
their birth--Life of Marion.&#xD;
&#xD;
at Britton's Neck, and below there. Do you&#xD;
think that you can, by any means, obtain this&#xD;
information ?"    -&#xD;
"I can try," answered Forstall, firmly.&#xD;
"And I doubt not you will succeed; but&#xD;
should the enterprise end tragically, I am sure&#xD;
I should deeply regret it,".said Marion.&#xD;
' I know the punishment due' to a spy, gen-&#xD;
eral, but I am ready to.incur the peril. Should&#xD;
I prove, unfortunate, and return ho more, I&#xD;
only ask to be remembered as one who tried to&#xD;
do his duty.".&#xD;
" That I can safely promise in such an event;&#xD;
but I hope for a happier termination of the&#xD;
affair. I wish, if you find it practicable, to&#xD;
learn what Gainey, Ferguson, Wemyss, and&#xD;
other story leaders are doing, and are contem-&#xD;
plating to do. If you fail, and the worst be-&#xD;
falls, you, my brigade will nobly avenge your&#xD;
death. Adopt such a disguise as you think&#xD;
best, and may a kind providence keep you&#xD;
from harm, and return yo- ?afe to camp again."&#xD;
Having expressed his perfect willingness to.&#xD;
'serve his country in- any capacity, Forstal -&#xD;
withdrew, and made immediate arrangements to&#xD;
fulfil the wishes of his commander. While mak-&#xD;
ing preparations-to perform the hazardous duty&#xD;
assigned him, it is possible he thought of Ruth&#xD;
Strickland,, and entertained a hope that ,ia&#xD;
should see her during his absence from the&#xD;
brigade.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Are you going to leave us ?" asked James&#xD;
Adair.&#xD;
For a time," replied Forstall.&#xD;
"If you should see Rose," said the young&#xD;
man,   tell her that-that--"&#xD;
Adair could not very well get any farther for&#xD;
some reason-&#xD;
Yes, I '1 tell her that," answered Frank,&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
You '11 oblige me," stammered Adair.&#xD;
"And what should I-say to Mary, if I should&#xD;
happen to see her ?' -continued Frank.&#xD;
"Inform her that the last time I saw Lewis&#xD;
Hawthorne, he was well," added Adair, quickly.&#xD;
" Lewis Hawthorne again," thought Frank.&#xD;
"I wonder who he is," and was about to ask&#xD;
respecting him, but Adair was gone. -&#xD;
Just as Frank was putting his foot into the&#xD;
stirrup, to mount his horse, he was addressed&#xD;
by Henderson.&#xD;
Not so fast, Mr. Forstall !" he exclaimed.&#xD;
"I have seen the general, and am to go with&#xD;
you. .&#xD;
"yThat is good news, indeed, for a long, and&#xD;
perilous ride was before me."&#xD;
But a short time elapsed before the two young&#xD;
men were riding away from " Lynch's Creek"&#xD;
towards the Pedep. The night had set in dark&#xD;
and rainy, and the prospect before them was by&#xD;
no means a pleasant one. The parties pro-&#xD;
ceeded several miles on their way without meet-&#xD;
ing with any adventure worthy of notice, but&#xD;
were not destined to be so fortunate as to reach&#xD;
Britton's Neck without incident.&#xD;
They were going forward at a respectable&#xD;
speed, when they unexpectedly overtook half a&#xD;
dozen men on foot, armed with muskets. ' Had&#xD;
they seen them a moment sooner, they could&#xD;
have avoided them; but it was too late to do so&#xD;
without exciting suspicion.  The men stopped&#xD;
and faced about. - Forstall and 'Heniderson ad-&#xD;
vanced boldly, trusting to their own resources&#xD;
to free them from the, .difficulty, should they&#xD;
prove to be loyalists.               .&#xD;
"Who comes here ?" cried one of the men,&#xD;
while they all 'assumed hostile attitudes.&#xD;
Friends, I hope," replied Henderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
"That 's onsartin," was the gruff rejoinder.&#xD;
"I suppose that we might put the same ques-&#xD;
tion to you that you have proposed to us," said&#xD;
Forstall.&#xD;
" Prehaps you might, mister ; but as we hap-&#xD;
pen to be the strongest party, we can have it&#xD;
pooty much our own way, I take it," returned&#xD;
one of the party, insolently.&#xD;
Forstall reflected an instant, and then replied.&#xD;
"Perhaps, my lads, we are peaceably dis-&#xD;
posed people, minding our own business, with-&#xD;
out intending harm to anybody ; and perhaps&#xD;
we are going to meet some of the king's men&#xD;
somewhere. What have you to say to'that ?"&#xD;
The men now conferred with each other amo-&#xD;
ment, in low voices.&#xD;
"Are you king's men ?" they asked, at&#xD;
length.&#xD;
"If you insist on knowing," said Henderson,&#xD;
bolkly, "we ire going to join Major Gainey&#xD;
somewhere on the Pedee."&#xD;
"I thought so," said one of the men to 'his&#xD;
comrades.  " They appeared to me like king's&#xD;
men from the first.'&#xD;
"Now as we have been frank with you, we&#xD;
would ke to know whether we are dealing with&#xD;
friends or foes," added Henderson, laying his&#xD;
hand on his sword.&#xD;
We're of the right sort ; so make yourselves&#xD;
easy. We're going to join Major Wemyss,&#xD;
who has been enlisting men on Black River, but&#xD;
is now working up towards the Catawba. When&#xD;
he gets his complement of men, he 's going to&#xD;
co-operate with Colonel Tarleton' in driving Ma-&#xD;
rion out of the country."&#xD;
"That will be a welcome event to all true&#xD;
loyalists," remarked Forstall.&#xD;
"It will, indeed," replied one of the tories;&#xD;
"and it is an event which will soon take place."&#xD;
"They say Marion and his men are ragged,&#xD;
cowardly vagabonds, who can't stand a regular&#xD;
charge of disciplined troops," said another.&#xD;
"Wemyss and Tarleton will soon burst on&#xD;
him like a clap of thunder," added a third.&#xD;
-" Gainey, I understand, is near Britton's&#xD;
Neck," observed Henderson, by way of a&#xD;
feeler.&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
THE PRIsoNERs. THE REscUE.&#xD;
&#xD;
F RANK FORSTALL rode towards Cam-&#xD;
hFden with such despatch, that at ten o'clock&#xD;
precisely, he met the prisoners on their way to&#xD;
Charleston. They were, as he had been in-&#xD;
4rmed by the royalists, strongly guarded. For-&#xD;
stall confessed some slight nervous trepidation&#xD;
ehe seared the British soldiers.&#xD;
"Where are you going, young man'?" asked&#xD;
the captain of the guard.&#xD;
"To Camden, sir, to join the troops under&#xD;
Cornwallis," replied Frank, touching his cap&#xD;
respectfully. Then he added instantly :&#xD;
"You have a fine lot of rebels here. I wish,&#xD;
captain, they were allsecured in this way. What&#xD;
a blessing it would be to the country."&#xD;
" Two hundred of them, sir, all told. Aint&#xD;
they guilty looking rascals'?" said the captain&#xD;
"They don't look as if they could be trust-&#xD;
ed," returned Frank.&#xD;
"Where are you from'?-                -&#xD;
"Britton's Neck, sir," answered Forstall,&#xD;
again touching his cap.&#xD;
"Is that Marion up on the Santee anywhere&#xD;
now ?" added the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
"No sir, he's in the full tide of retreat&#xD;
towards North Carolina."&#xD;
"Indeed I"&#xD;
"'Tis true, sir ; and every true loyalist-re-&#xD;
joices at the event. The fact is, he heard that&#xD;
Tarleton and Wemyss were marching towards&#xD;
the Santee."&#xD;
S"If th'e Swamp Fox knows what's good for&#xD;
himself, he'll stay there."&#xD;
" So I think. How far will you go to-day,&#xD;
captain'?"&#xD;
"Not much farther. ' We all feel pretty tired,&#xD;
and since Marion's Brigade has marched off, I&#xD;
don't feel so much in a hurry about getting to&#xD;
Charleston. Is there a good tavern anywhere&#xD;
near, on the route'?"&#xD;
"Yes ; there's the Blue House tavern, where&#xD;
they manage to keep all kinds of refreshment&#xD;
for man and beast. And mine host has as good&#xD;
liquor in the cellar as a man would wisho taste.&#xD;
Try somb of it, captain."&#xD;
Forstall drew a small flask from a side pocket&#xD;
and passed it-to the officer, who drank, smacked&#xD;
his lips, and pronounced it the "right kind of&#xD;
stuff."- He then expatiated somewhat on his&#xD;

should be so very lucky as to meet him an&#xD;
where.&#xD;
Frank made his best bow to the valiant cox&#xD;
mander,' and the prisoners and their. esco&#xD;
moved on. It was an interesting moment&#xD;
our hero. As he contemplated the dejected an&#xD;
wayworn Americans, his heart was moved wi&#xD;
pity, not unmixed with indignation.- How a&#xD;
dently he wished for a detachment of Marion&#xD;
Brigade, to set them at liberty. How Captai&#xD;
Nick, with his " tarnal critters," would scatt&#xD;
the guard!&#xD;
Ferstall looked eagerly for Mr. Strickland&#xD;
and he began to fear that he was not amon&#xD;
them, when he discovered him near the rear o&#xD;
the cortege.  Strickland raised his eyes an&#xD;
they encountered Frank's. Marching by th&#xD;
side of Strickland was a neighbor with whon&#xD;
Forstall was well acquainted, He also recog&#xD;
nized our hero, and asked him where he wa&#xD;
going.&#xD;
This was a painful question for him to answer&#xD;
but he replied firmly that he was on the way t&#xD;
in'aden, to enroll himself in the army of Corn&#xD;
wallis.&#xD;
While Frank was speaking, Mr. $trickland&#xD;
gave him a reproachful look, which brought the&#xD;
color to his cheeks. °&#xD;
le thinks me a despicable villain," said&#xD;
Frank to himself, and the idea grieved him.&#xD;
" The enemies' of our country will, be glad&#xD;
of your services, no doubt," said Strickland,&#xD;
in a melancholy voice.&#xD;
Thess words cut Forstall to the quick, for he&#xD;
could not well endure the idea of being thought&#xD;
a tory by Mr. Strickland, even for a moment ;&#xD;
but he thought of Ruth, and tried to bear it&#xD;
manfully. While reflections of this nature agi-&#xD;
tated his mind, the mournful cortege swept&#xD;
slowly on, and he was left alone. Attempting&#xD;
to shake off the sadness which the spectacle had&#xD;
produced, he rode forward a mile or two, and&#xD;

's   " That Quaker feller puzzles me, pulverize&#xD;
La me if he don't," added Ben, emphatically.&#xD;
er' " He came into camp not long ago, looking so&#xD;
much like a ;egerlar greeny_ that I didn't&#xD;

a    "I can't tell, I'm sure," rejoined Adair,&#xD;

s    "Here he comes now, with Fdrstall and&#xD;
Ienderson."&#xD;
The two approached.&#xD;
o " What's the row ?" asked B6n of Frank.&#xD;
" Nothing only the Brigade is getting read&#xD;
to march at a moment's warning," was the&#xD;
reply..&#xD;
. Is there a smart prospect of a tarnal tussle-?"&#xD;
inquired Captain Nick, who joined them at that&#xD;
instant&#xD;
' I think so," replied John Henderson.&#xD;
" It strikes me," added Rowan, "that this&#xD;
is rather a curious place for a man of peace."&#xD;
" Thyti art right, good Benjamin," said Job,&#xD;
gently.&#xD;
" And them are rather queer things for a&#xD;
man of peace to wear about his clothes," re-&#xD;
sumed Ben, pointing at the butts of a pair of&#xD;
horse pistols that were protruding from his coat&#xD;
pockets.&#xD;
" Right again, friend Benjamin. I am like&#xD;
St. Paul, when among these people, all things&#xD;
to OLmen; because I cannot resist those that&#xD;
ar in authority. It is even so, verily."&#xD;
&#xD;
" You saved my life, and I am grateful for th&#xD;
it, as the common run~of folks would .be ; but w&#xD;
that's neither here nor there ; it can't make one&#xD;
hair white nor black, nor hinder me from feeling' m&#xD;
that somebody that shall be nameless, is a bum- ax&#xD;
bug. That's what's on my mind at this time, ti&#xD;
and if anybody wants to take it up and be ugly&#xD;
about it, I'm ready to pulverize that person as a&#xD;
long as pulverizing '11 have a savin' effect on i&#xD;
the moral principles."                     r&#xD;
Ben Rowan . pronounced these words with c&#xD;
great gravity, and deliberately rolled up his coat&#xD;
sleeves; a little piece of formality highly sig- e&#xD;
nificant to the beholders.        .&#xD;
It was now dark, and the buglek of the Brigade g&#xD;
summoned all to the parade ground. .y&#xD;
" Fall in-tumble in-be lively, boys- .&#xD;
there's work afore us,'' said Captain. Hawes. .c&#xD;
" Verily, I am sick'of war 1" exclaimed Joba&#xD;
Dawson, as he mounted his horse and fell into&#xD;
his accustomed place.&#xD;
Ben looked at him, but deigned no reply.&#xD;
" Jones is throwed agin," said Higgins, sor-&#xD;
rowfully. ,&#xD;
"He wants to disgrace the hull Americanf&#xD;
army," rejoined Hawes.&#xD;
Forstall and Henderson exchanged glances.4&#xD;
"Here comes the general," observed James&#xD;
Adair.&#xD;
Marion now spoke 'with all the commissioned&#xD;
officers, and they in turn spoke with the others,&#xD;
and very soon the business in contemplation wah&#xD;
pretty generally understood.&#xD;
"Two hundred prisoners at Nelson's Ferry&#xD;
that's got to be re-took," said Hawes, riding&#xD;
back to bis'men, after the general had cofhmu-&#xD;
nicated his orders to 'the officers.  " They're&#xD;
under an escort of ninety strong, and there'll&#xD;
be a tarnal tussle, no doubt ; but we shall be&#xD;
victorious when we straighten up. in our might,&#xD;
and bust on 'em like a bombshell. Some of&#xD;
our lads have been down to the F9rry, and found&#xD;
out all the particulars. When we've whipt the&#xD;
rascals, and freed the prisoners, we've got some-&#xD;
thin' else on hand that's rather enterprisin'&#xD;
&#xD;
an otherwise, which I will tell you more about&#xD;
hen I get ready."&#xD;
" Forward !" cried Marion, and the Brigade&#xD;
oved towards Nelson's Ferry, in good spirits,&#xD;
nd eager for an opportunity to test their devo-&#xD;
on to liberty.&#xD;
Whilaon the way Forstall related his late&#xD;
adventures to his companions, to which they&#xD;
stened with eager interest, bestowing many&#xD;
ough but sincere praises upon his address and&#xD;
ourage.&#xD;
During Marion's swift and silent march, the&#xD;
aptain of the escort, whose name we do not&#xD;
tow remember, was regaling himself on the&#xD;
good things to be found at the "Blue House."&#xD;
He ate, drank, smoked, boasted, and threatened&#xD;
Marion's Bigade with utter extermination if be&#xD;
could but be so fortunate as to meet with it&#xD;
anywhere, or under any circumstances.&#xD;
The gallant captain continued in this happy&#xD;
frame of mind until past midnight, and his&#xD;
courage, enjoyment, zeal, and hatred of the&#xD;
whigs seemed to be fast increasing.&#xD;
But the poor prisoners did not by any means&#xD;
share in the good cheer of the 'British officer ;&#xD;
they were huddled like cattle into the bari and&#xD;
outbuildings, suffering for food and drink, and&#xD;
shivering with cold.  They set in deep and sor-&#xD;
rowftil silence, each absorbed in his own indi-&#xD;
vidual misery., A guard was posted about the&#xD;
barn, and the house also, while-the belief that&#xD;
prevailed among them, in consequence of the&#xD;
false information that had been given, that&#xD;
Marion was retreating towards North Carolina,&#xD;
added greatly to the feeling of security that&#xD;
was so grateful to the hearts of, the British&#xD;
hirelings.&#xD;
" Yes," cried the valorous captain of the&#xD;
escort, with a round oath, " I wish that Marion&#xD;
was here now. I'd so cut him   -"&#xD;
At that moment several muskets were dis-&#xD;
charged in rapid succession, Every man sprang&#xD;
to his feet, and looked at his comrade.&#xD;
" Charge, men ! charge !" shouted a voice&#xD;
terrible in battle.&#xD;

"I believe it's Marion, by   .  To arms,&#xD;

his cheeks grew deadly pale.&#xD;
" Straighten up, you tarnal critters !  Reap&#xD;
the rascals with your sickles of death !" shouted&#xD;
Captain Nick.&#xD;
Th whole Brigade thundered down among&#xD;
the;sentinels, who fired their muskets and fled,&#xD;
towards the house. In an instant General Ma-&#xD;
rion was at the door, calling on them to surren-&#xD;
der, in those startling tones which distinguished&#xD;
him in the hour of battle.&#xD;
The summons was immediately obeyed ; every&#xD;
&#xD;
F   ORSI'LL was the first to fly to the pris-&#xD;
oners with the good news that the guard&#xD;
would now exchange places with them, and&#xD;
were waiting for the darbies.&#xD;
"What, you here, Frank ?" exclajined Mr.&#xD;
Strickland.&#xD;
" Thank God, yes," said Forstall, warmly.&#xD;
". Xy position this morning was an ambiguous&#xD;
one; but heaven be praised, to-night I occupy'&#xD;
one that cannot be misunderstood. I have the&#xD;
honor to belong to Marion's Brigade."&#xD;
"That makes my heart beat with joy, Frank,&#xD;
for -I know that my daughter Ruth loves you;&#xD;
and it would grieve me sorely to have her set&#xD;
her affections on one who has no love for his&#xD;
country," exclainled Mr. Strickland.&#xD;
Forstall then communicated to the latter some&#xD;
information, which he had received from General&#xD;
Marion, concerning the schemes of Gainey and&#xD;
Cunningham, in relation to the abduction of&#xD;
Ruth and Mary Adair.&#xD;
"How he obtained this information," added&#xD;
Frank, "I cannot tell; but I. have many con-&#xD;
jectures on the subject ; and those conjectures&#xD;
have reference to onb Job Dawson--a singular&#xD;
&#xD;
young man of whom I *ill tell you mpre anon."&#xD;
"Mr. -Forstall," said Marion, approaching&#xD;
our hero, "there is nottime to lose.  Captain&#xD;
Hawes's company is ready to go to Britton's&#xD;
Neck, to defeat the villany of Gainey and&#xD;
Cunningham. You can hurry there' with all&#xD;
possible despatch, and I will follow with the rest&#xD;
of the Brigade, as quick as circumstances will&#xD;
permit ; for we are now; you know, encumbered&#xD;
yith ninety prisoners."&#xD;
" Yes, let us away," said Strickland, anx-&#xD;
iously.&#xD;
" All ready to march towards Britton's&#xD;
Neck*!" cried Captain Nick, to Forstall.&#xD;
"There's the British 'officer's horse," said&#xD;
Henderson. " You might as well mount him,&#xD;
Mr. Strickland ; I think it's your turn to ride&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"That's my opinion, sir, for I have walked&#xD;
all the way froin Camden, and that cowardly&#xD;
fellow rode," replied Strickland, leaping into&#xD;
the saddle.&#xD;
"Jones's horse's a cuttin' up capers agin,"&#xD;
said Higgins.&#xD;

"No, I haint," answered the unhappy Jones,&#xD;
sullenly.&#xD;

"Verily, I hope we shall be in time to rescue&#xD;

they spurred or ward.&#xD;
tI should go mad,,if I thought we should&#xD;
fail !" he exclaimed.&#xD;
" They are men of Belial, and the fear of&#xD;
the Lord is not before their eyes," added Job.&#xD;
" Humbug !" muttered Ben Rowan.&#xD;
"One thing I should really like to know,&#xD;
Mr. Dawson ?" rejoined our, hero.&#xD;
"Speak thy mind, friend Frank," said Job,&#xD;
mildly.&#xD;
Iam curious to, know by what means Gen-&#xD;
eral Marion learned about the nefarious schemes&#xD;
of Gained and Cunningham," answered For-&#xD;
stall.&#xD;
"I will inform thee, friend Frank. One&#xD;
Eldad Tewksbury went down to the camp of the&#xD;
enemy as a spy, and heard then devising this&#xD;
wickedness in regard to the two 'maidens," said&#xD;
Job.&#xD;
"And who is this Eldad Tewksbury ?" in&#xD;
terrogated Frank.&#xD;
"He's a cousin to Jotham Stebbins," replie&#xD;
Dawson, gravely.&#xD;
"But I never found out who he w'as," re&#xD;
turned Frank.      .&#xD;
. " The crooked shall be ade straight, an&#xD;
the rough places smooth," added Job, prophet&#xD;
ically.&#xD;
aBah !" exclaimed Ben Rowan, contenipts&#xD;
ously.&#xD;
"There's some considerable mystery hangin&#xD;
about this subject," observed Henderson,'e&#xD;
changing glances with James Adair.&#xD;
"So it seems.'-' remarked the latter.&#xD;
&#xD;
BRIGADfl.                              97&#xD;
At this juncture, Mr. Rowan, the, boxer,&#xD;
alluded in a very delicate manner to the pul-&#xD;
verizing system, as a sublime antidote to all&#xD;
mystery.&#xD;
When near the Neck, For tall, Dawson, Hen-&#xD;
derson and Adair, were sent forward by Captain&#xD;
Hawes to see if the enemy could be discovered,&#xD;
learn his exact position, and the best point, of&#xD;
attack. They galloped off to perform this duty&#xD;
with right good will, and it was remarked that&#xD;
even the quiet and impassive Job Dawson ap-&#xD;
peared, to shake off his usual apathy, and feel&#xD;
the deepest interest in what was transpiring.&#xD;
He was the first to discover Gainey and his dra-&#xD;
goons; they were moving up the hill towards&#xD;
Strickland's, and soon halted within a few hun-&#xD;
dred yards of the house. Fastening their horses,&#xD;
they advanced on foot until they were near&#xD;
enough for all practical purposes.&#xD;
"They have not yet divided their men, I be-&#xD;
lieve," said Dawson.&#xD;
"Perhaps they have changed their minds,"&#xD;
returned Forstall, " and intend to do their vil-&#xD;
lanous work here first, and then move on to&#xD;
Adair's."&#xD;
" That's very possible," said Adair.&#xD;
"I wish we could get near enough to hear&#xD;
what they say," he added.&#xD;
"That would be time wasted, it seems to me.&#xD;
Why should we have our ears wounded by hear-&#xD;
ing them profane the names of Ruth and Mary,"&#xD;
returned Frank.&#xD;
"I think you are right, Mr. Forstall. They&#xD;
are about ready to move on again, and to delay&#xD;
d would be to allow Miss Strickland to be un-&#xD;
necessarily agitated and frightened by their&#xD;
rudeness," said Henderson.&#xD;
This view of the case appeared so reasonable&#xD;
d that all parties instantly retraced their steps to&#xD;
t- the spot where they had left their horses, and&#xD;
mounting, returned to the detachment, where&#xD;
u. they related what they bad seen to Captain&#xD;
Hawes.&#xD;
g    " Do you think there'll be time to make an&#xD;
x- almighty oration ?" ehe asked, anxiously.&#xD;
" It must be- pretty short, captain, for you&#xD;
see these young fellows are impatient, because&#xD;
