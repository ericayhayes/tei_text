which seemed to be very bilious.&#xD;
Miss Katrine, however, did not seem to&#xD;
utte any-in fact, she had not time to do&#xD;
so, being engaged over a delicate lunch of&#xD;
pig's feet, sour-kraut, and Albany ale.&#xD;
"Are you seek, Messieur Snodgrass ?" ask-&#xD;

"Wofully-wofully !" moaned the member&#xD;
of the Baptist persuasion.&#xD;

the latter closed his eyes, and drained the&#xD;

man. And lie went to attend to his house-&#xD;

Mr. Lascelles was not long in Betsy's state-&#xD;

raise, which port she reached just seventy-&#xD;
three days from the time she sailed. She&#xD;
had crossed the equator without frying in a&#xD;
a complete calm, and doubled Cape horn&#xD;
without meeting an adverse gale, though she&#xD;
had not had quite as much wind as her mas-&#xD;
ter would have liked.&#xD;
Fearing that wood and water might become&#xD;
scarce before he reached the point of his des-&#xD;
tination, Ethelbert had determined to run&#xD;
into port to add to his stores of those indis-&#xD;
pensable articles.&#xD;
"What do you say to a run on shore, Mas-&#xD;
ter Ernest ?" asked Ethelbert, with a pleas-&#xD;
ant smile, soon after the anchor had b en&#xD;
dropped, and while the crew were yet furng&#xD;
the sails. ''Tis said the Valparaiso girls are&#xD;
the prettiest in the world."&#xD;
"Their beauty is a matter of indifference&#xD;
to me," said young Smead, rather contempt-&#xD;
uously. "I never saw a woman yet who was&#xD;
worth a second glance."&#xD;
"0 you young heretic ! You ought to&#xD;
be confined in a harem, for the term of your&#xD;
natural life, with a hundred oriental houris&#xD;
to tense you out of your senses I"&#xD;
Such pleasures might suit you, Captain&#xD;
Van Ness," said Smiad, quietly ; "but I&#xD;
would refer a cage of white bears, chattering&#xD;
monkeys, or horned owls. But who is that&#xD;
coming on board ?"&#xD;
"TThe captain of the port, I presume. I&#xD;
must pay my respects to him, and then call&#xD;
on the American Consul," said Ethelbert, as&#xD;
he glanced at an individual in uniform, who&#xD;
was approaching the vessel in a well-manned&#xD;
barge.  "After that," he continued, "I'm&#xD;
going to have a run among the girls, and&#xD;
you'll miss sonic fun if you don't go along."&#xD;
" Perhaps so ?"&#xD;
"Why, how serious you look, Master Er-&#xD;
nest. What are you thinking of?"&#xD;
" Of the inconstancy of men, Captain Van&#xD;
Ness, as-exemplified in yourself, for instance.&#xD;
here have you been all the voyage lamenting&#xD;
the separation of yourself from the lads' you&#xD;
say you love in New York-sometimes almost&#xD;
weeping when I have sung songs which you&#xD;
say she used to sing to you ; and now, at the&#xD;
very first port you enter, you begin to talk of&#xD;
strange beauties-to sigh for their company."&#xD;
Pob. Ernest, pol-I shallinot fall in love&#xD;
with any of these dusky maidens of the South.&#xD;
But even if I did, all would be right when I&#xD;
got back to New York-a sailor has a right to&#xD;
a sweetheart in every port he visits."&#xD;
"Indeed !" said young Smead, rather sar-&#xD;
castically. "Suppose your lady-love should&#xD;
take it into her head to forget you until you&#xD;
returned, and accept the addresses of sonne&#xD;
'sailor' who wished to have a sweetheart in&#xD;

proposed that they should cease dancing.&#xD;
Of course, it was understood that Ethelber&#xD;
was to escort her home. In a few seconds, hi&#xD;
had carefully wrapped her shawl around her&#xD;
and, entirely forgetful of the warning which&#xD;
ho had received, stepped out into the darn&#xD;
and narrow street, with her leaning on hii&#xD;
arm.&#xD;
He had gone but a few paces when he heard&#xD;
a footstep close behind him ; a man brushed&#xD;
by him, and, at the same instant, a light&#xD;
from a ship's lantern flashed out from under&#xD;
the cloak of Ernest, just in time to reveal&#xD;
a Spaniard before him, with his arm uplifted&#xD;
and holding a glittering knife in his hand.&#xD;
"Joaquin !" screamed Teresa, as she fell&#xD;
fainting in the arms of Ethelbert.&#xD;
The would-be assassin irestantly fled, while&#xD;
the father of Teresa stepped up, and said, in&#xD;
Spanish :&#xD;
"Senor American, I will take charge of my&#xD;
daughter !"&#xD;
"You have saved my life, dear, generous&#xD;
Ernest !" said Ethelbert. "But what does&#xD;
this man say ?"&#xD;
"lie asks to take charge of his daughter,"&#xD;
replied Ernest.&#xD;
"Is that man your father ?" asked Ethel-&#xD;
hert of Teresa, who was now recovering.&#xD;
"He is ! Leave me, senor, or you will lose&#xD;
your life !" sobbed the beautiful girl.&#xD;
"Since it is your wish, I leave you, Te-&#xD;

again. Buena noche !"&#xD;
'e poor girl made no reply ; for her father&#xD;
hurried her away, uttering no benedictions as&#xD;
he went, on the \Yankees, either individually,&#xD;
or as a nation.&#xD;
" Well this is an adventure, I must say,"&#xD;
saidEthelbert to Ernest. "What do you&#xD;

tude which I can never wholly repay ! I&#xD;
was for the time infatuated with the beauty of&#xD;
that girl, and flattered into a delirium by her&#xD;

t   "Here we are at the boat, and the crew is&#xD;

Ernest.&#xD;

schooner.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
"You will take all the boats, Mr. Tyrrell,&#xD;
and go ashore for wood, and also hire two&#xD;
water-tanks, or three, if possible, to some&#xD;
alongside, and fill our empty casks and&#xD;

early on the morning which followed the night&#xD;
of the fandango.&#xD;
"Why, sir, I thought you said you'd be after&#xD;

"I have altered my mind. I've a right to&#xD;

"how do you find yourself this morning,&#xD;
captain ?" he asked.&#xD;
"In good condition, and as full of gratitude&#xD;
now as I was three hours ago, for your gen-&#xD;

noble conduct, nor the great happiness which&#xD;
your company has afforded me during the en-&#xD;

on deck, to make further inquiries about   " Ship ahoy'"&#xD;
N eptuue of the captain, and to impart the  "Iallo Y" responded Captain Van Tassel&#xD;
&#xD;
27&#xD;
&#xD;
through his trumpet, he having just appeared&#xD;
on deck dressed in his best suit.&#xD;
"What ship is that ?" continued the voice&#xD;
"Der Kinderhook, from New-York, Myn-&#xD;
dert Van Tassell, master !"&#xD;
"Heave to-I comes apoard !"&#xD;
"Yaw, Mynheer Neptune, I do dat so sdon&#xD;
as never was, und you will give us more wint&#xD;
py and py !"&#xD;
And the Captain at onee had the main-top-&#xD;
sail and topgallant sail braced aback.&#xD;
Considerable bustle was heard forward for&#xD;
a few moments, and then the canvas curtain&#xD;
was suddenly taken down, and.a curious spec-&#xD;
tacle was made visible to Messieurs Laseelles&#xD;
and Snodgrass, and Betsy Peck.&#xD;
A very quaintly-dressed old man, with a&#xD;
long beard and long straggling locks, which&#xD;
looked'very like oakum, advanced aft. lie&#xD;
had a wreath of sea-weed oil his head, and a&#xD;
huge harpoon in his hand. A strip of canvas,&#xD;
shaped something like the skirt of a tunic.&#xD;
covered him from his hips to his knees. It&#xD;
was dripping with salt water, as also his hair&#xD;
and beard. He wore no other garments. His&#xD;
features bore a strong resemblance to those&#xD;
of the second mate of the ship, and they&#xD;
might have been related ; for it was the boast'&#xD;
of the mate that he had been born at sea, and&#xD;
never had been ashore more than two weeks&#xD;
at a time during the whole course of his life.j&#xD;
Behind this old man cane a dripping and&#xD;
very hard-faced representative of the female&#xD;
sex, and an individual who, dressed sonic-&#xD;
thing like himself, carried as implements of&#xD;
his office, a razor, the blade of which was&#xD;
made from a piece of iron hoop, and was at&#xD;
least a foot long. Also a bucket containing&#xD;
a compound evidently more tenacious than&#xD;
saponacecous, for it appeared to have a good&#xD;
=*        deal of tar in its composition. For a shaving&#xD;
_Y       brush he had a well-worn broom with a bro-&#xD;
ken handle.&#xD;
"You are very welcome apoard der Knick.&#xD;
erbocker, Mynheer Neptune-you und your&#xD;
frau und your harper !" said Captain Van&#xD;
Tassell, ad vanecing and shaking hands with&#xD;
the jolly God of the Sea. "Will you all&#xD;
drink some rum mit me and smoke a pipe?"&#xD;
"Yaw-we'll do dat und den examine your&#xD;
passengers what 'ave nevercross der line, and&#xD;
paid inc der toll!"&#xD;
"Mille diables-Neptune speak Dutch to ze&#xD;
Dutch. I wondare if he will not speak French&#xD;
wiz me ?" said Monsieur Lascelles, and ad-&#xD;
vancing, with a low bow, he said :&#xD;
"nComment vous, portez-vous, Monsieur&#xD;
Neptune ?"&#xD;
The jolly god looked nonplussed for a&#xD;
moment, but then in an instant recovered his&#xD;
self-possession, and replied in Dutch:&#xD;
" N ix forstay&#xD;
x            "A lha-lhe does not reply to me in French,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
but in Dutch, which I do not understand. I&#xD;
shall write to ze Courrier des Etats- Unis, zat&#xD;
Neptune is Dutch,-all se sane as Monsieur&#xD;
Colman, eir particular frent of ze opera 1"&#xD;
The rum and pipes were brought into re-&#xD;
quisition, and for about ten minutes Neptune&#xD;
and his suite occupied themselves with those&#xD;
articles with great apparent gusto. I should&#xD;
have mentioned that some half dozen Tritons&#xD;
followed in the train of the Sea God, to aid&#xD;
in the collection of his dues.&#xD;
"What do you tink of se God of so Zea,&#xD;
now, Monsieur Snodg'ass, eh ?" asked Las-&#xD;
celes, of the reverend Zlihu, at this juncture.&#xD;
"It is some mummery, but verily I cannot&#xD;
understand the drift thereof !" said Mr. Snod-&#xD;
grass.&#xD;
"Was is dat you call me, you mister mit&#xD;
der towel on your neck ?" asked Neptune, who&#xD;
had heard the reply of Snodgrass, at thesame&#xD;
time striding wrathfully toward him, with his&#xD;
harpoon poised as if to transfix him.&#xD;
" Aroint thee, Satan-avaunt!" shrieked Mr.&#xD;
Snodgrass, retreating until he tripped and&#xD;
fell against a coil of rigging.&#xD;
" Who der duyvel be you anyvay ?" asked&#xD;
Neptune as he bent forward over the fallen&#xD;
and terror-stricken man.&#xD;
" Elihu Snodgrass, a member of the Baptist&#xD;
persuasion, favorable to complete immer-&#xD;
sion ?"answered the terrified preeher, hoping&#xD;
evidently by lis last declarafon to uollify&#xD;
the water-god.&#xD;
"A breaher-man ! Come here frail and see&#xD;
a broacher man what gets his livin' by doing&#xD;
nothing! lie breaches dat a man musn't&#xD;
work on Sunday, and den takes money for&#xD;
working' dat day all de work he does 1" cried&#xD;
Neptune.&#xD;
"Make der fool pay two tolls den!t" said&#xD;
tho wife of Neptune, coming up and looking&#xD;
at the trembling Elihu with an expression of&#xD;
great contempt.&#xD;
"Preachers don't pay toll nowhere. I never&#xD;
did, and, please grace, I never will !" said&#xD;
the Reverend Elihu, picking himself up and&#xD;
trying to get to the cabin.&#xD;
This attempt was however frustrated, for&#xD;
while he laid on the deck, several of Neptune's&#xD;
body-guard had been posted as sentinels in&#xD;
that direction.&#xD;
"Dat man needs to be shaved ! A breacher&#xD;
man has no pizness mit a peard !" said Nep-&#xD;
tune to his barber.&#xD;
In  an instant the Reverend Elileu was&#xD;
struggling in the grasp of two of Neptune's&#xD;
aids, who forced hn on his knees, while the&#xD;
barber, first lathering his thin and almost&#xD;
smooth jaws with tar, proceeded with his&#xD;
razor to barberize him to the extent of his&#xD;
ability.&#xD;
Whenever the unfortunate man opened his&#xD;
mouth to yell in angry agony, the barber&#xD;

have a boat, but went in it to aid her in her&#xD;
selectione nod purchases. These were enor-&#xD;
mous; for, when the boat came off, it was&#xD;
loaded literally to the water's-edge.&#xD;
Mr. Snodgrass having evinced a desire to&#xD;
visit the shore, although he considered it&#xD;
Worse than a heathen country, inasmuch as&#xD;
it was Catholic, asked Mrs. Betsy Peck if she&#xD;
would not like, also, to go on shore.&#xD;
The lady was not loth to visit land again,&#xD;
especially under the protection of a man of&#xD;
grace, like Mr. Snodgrass, and she at once&#xD;
conuented to go, as soon as she could get&#xD;
* fixed up."&#xD;
This last idea suggested to Mr. Snodgrass&#xD;
the thought that he had better put on a cleri-&#xD;
cal garb, else the "persuasion" might not&#xD;
be properly represented in his person in that&#xD;
heathen land. So he went to his state-room,&#xD;
and donned his suit of rusty-black, swathed&#xD;
his neck in a white handkerchief-for Bets&#xD;
had washed and ironed it herself-put on his&#xD;
bell-crowned, bek, sad napless hat, his best&#xD;
cowhide  boots - making   himself "shine&#xD;
again," as he thought.&#xD;
After a labor of nearly two hours, Mrs.&#xD;
Betsy Peck came out, with her hair curled in&#xD;
wiry ringlets, her cheeks quite blooming, her&#xD;
whole appearance captivating. She had a&#xD;
black silk dress on, which was stiffer than&#xD;
the mainsail, and rustled, as she moved, like&#xD;
a field of dry, standing corn, when the wind&#xD;
shakes it, stalk and leaf; she had a white-&#xD;
apron on, which came nearly to her feet ;&#xD;
the leghorn honnet, before described, was on&#xD;
her head ; and she again carried the turkey-&#xD;
tail fan and smelling-bottle.&#xD;
And she also produced a huge, green cot-&#xD;
ton umbrella, which she begged Mr. Snod-&#xD;
grass to carry, for fear that it might rain.&#xD;
Under her belt was tucked a hue silk hand-&#xD;
kerchief, of many colors, scented with laven-&#xD;
der-water; and she made the Reverend Elihu&#xD;
a present of one just like it, also scented,&#xD;
which so pleased and delighted him, that he&#xD;
said he never, never could think of "wiping&#xD;
his nose on such a precious relict!"&#xD;
Having made all their preparations, the&#xD;
eccentric-looking couple appeared on deck,&#xD;
and asked for a boat. Captain Van Tassel!&#xD;
at once ordered a boat to be got ready to&#xD;
carry them on shore. Mr. Snodgrass now&#xD;
bethought him of a bundle of tracts which&#xD;
he had on board, and hurried below to get&#xD;
them, not doubting but they would achieve a&#xD;
great deal of good, as they were printed in&#xD;
English. He had saved them for the Kana-&#xD;
ka. thus far.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
Mr. Snodgrass and Mrs. Betsey Peck hav-&#xD;
ing been landed, commenced their perambu-&#xD;
lations of the city, Mr. Snodgrass holding the&#xD;
&#xD;
green, cotton umbrella over their heads, to&#xD;
shade them from the intolerable heat.&#xD;
Spaniards are almost universally a very&#xD;
polite people, and less afflicted with an ex-&#xD;
hibitable curiosity than almost any others on&#xD;
earth ; and in Valparaiso they were so used&#xD;
to seeing Americans and English, that the&#xD;
appearance of either in their streets never&#xD;
attracted any attention.&#xD;
But the outre rig, and exceedingly odd ap-&#xD;
pearance of this couple, caused them either&#xD;
to believe that they were masquerading out&#xD;
of season, or else were from some new and&#xD;
unknown region, where people dressed most&#xD;
strangely ; for quite a crowd of young chil-&#xD;
dren, of both sexes, and negroes, and Indians,&#xD;
followed Mr. Snodgrass and Mirs. Peck, as&#xD;
they went along, rather to the annoyance of&#xD;
the lady, but not much to that of the Rever-&#xD;
end Elihu, who was not destitute of vanity,&#xD;
and believed that his personal appearance&#xD;
"drew" the crowd.&#xD;
"Let us stop at the corner of this big pas-&#xD;
tur' lot," said he, as they arrived at a plaza;&#xD;
"and I'll say a few words to the benighted&#xD;
ereetors, an give 'em some tracts."&#xD;
"I do wish there was a tavern, or suthin'&#xD;
where I could go in and sit down i" said poor&#xD;
Betsy. "These creeturs stare me all out o'&#xD;
face, and I'm so warm."&#xD;
"Wait, beloved sister, until after I've ad-&#xD;
dressed the heathen on the necessity of total&#xD;
immersion, and given them a few tracts ; and&#xD;
I'll try and hunt up one, for I begin to feel&#xD;
the need of refreshments-a kind of a sinkin'&#xD;
at the stomach, as I did when I was sea-sick."&#xD;
And the reverend Elihu having found a&#xD;
square stone, mounted it--while Mrs. Betsy&#xD;
sat at his feet-and commenced, in a loud,&#xD;
nasal tone, his exhortation. Though none of&#xD;
his auditory could understand a word of what&#xD;
he said, their numbers increased every mo-&#xD;
ment rapidly.&#xD;
Acting as if he thought-and, perhaps,&#xD;
really thinking-that his eloquence was thus&#xD;
charming the multitude, who now began to&#xD;
think that he was crazy, Mr.Snodgrass spoke&#xD;
yet louder and louder, descenting upon the&#xD;
talsity of all beliefs but his own, and sending&#xD;
every one down, down to the lower regions,&#xD;
who did not believe in or practice complex&#xD;
immersion, etc.&#xD;
All at once, as he paused to recover breath,&#xD;
a small bell was heard tinkling in a street,&#xD;
which led into the plaza ; and, as its sound&#xD;
reached their ears, the people of the vast&#xD;
crowd were seen to sink to their knees in an&#xD;
instant, and all were silent. This movement&#xD;
rather surprised Mr. Snodgrass, although hi&#xD;
first thought was that he had made a whole-&#xD;
sale conversion. But when he saw a proces-&#xD;
sion of priests, with lighted tapers, bearing&#xD;
the image of a crucified Saviour on a cross&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SHELL-HUNTER ; OR, AN OCEAN LOVE-CHASE.&#xD;
&#xD;
,nd the chalice of the Sacred Host under a&#xD;
ee.nopy, and the images of several saints be-&#xD;
aide, his astonishment vanished, and his anger&#xD;
increased-or rather his zeal&#xD;
"O ye idolaters !" he shouted.  "Why&#xD;
bow ye down to wood and to stone !"&#xD;
Just at this moment a guard of soldiers&#xD;
approached ; and the officer who commanded&#xD;
them gave him some order which he did not&#xD;
understand, as it was spoken in Spanish. All&#xD;
that he could make out was calaboza, and he&#xD;
had heard on board ship that calaboza meant&#xD;
prison.&#xD;
He did not, however, heed the officer at all;&#xD;
but, as the procession came nearer, shouted:&#xD;
"0 ye minions of Rome I see ye not one.&#xD;
who is anointed-"&#xD;
His remarks were suddenly cut short by&#xD;
the not-very-tender prick of a bayonet on&#xD;
that portion of his body which would first&#xD;
have come in contact with . chair had ho&#xD;
sat down.&#xD;
"Oh I" he yelled.  "Don't do that --it&#xD;
harts!"&#xD;
The sword of the officer made a sweep in&#xD;
the air at this moment ; and Mrs. Peck&#xD;
screamed fearfully--for she thought that the&#xD;
reverend Elihu was about to lose his precious'&#xD;
hL.ad. But it was only his hat which the&#xD;
officer knocked off, and which fell directly in&#xD;
front of the priest who carried the crucifix.&#xD;
Elihu rushed after his precious tile. The&#xD;
priest kicked it out of his way into a mud-&#xD;
puddle. Elihu was flesh and blood ! That&#xD;
hat had been worn by his father, and his&#xD;
r grandfather also. It had been a Sunday-go-&#xD;
to-meeting hat for near a century, and now&#xD;
it was kicked into a mud-puddle by a Catho-&#xD;
lie priest!&#xD;
Elihu looked at the hat-'twas but one&#xD;
brief, fiery glance. His ebenezer rose! Ho&#xD;
struck straight from the shoulder, and the&#xD;
bundle of bones at the lower cd of his right&#xD;
arm landed full in the face of the hapless&#xD;
priest, who went down much in the sty e of&#xD;
Sayers in the presence of Heenan.&#xD;
The reader may well believe that "iRome&#xD;
howled" about that time. The soldiers pitch-&#xD;
ed after Snodgrass, who, having got his hand&#xD;
in, went to his work handsomely, as the ring&#xD;
reporters would say-instantly and ably sec-&#xD;
onded by Mrs. Betsy Peck, with her closed&#xD;
umbrella, which she wielded more to ward off.&#xD;
blows from him than anything else. Down&#xD;
went priests, and saints, and sinners in a&#xD;
heap. Torches flew hissing through the air.&#xD;
Shrieks, and curses, and yells reverberated&#xD;
among the stone walls of the streets and&#xD;
plaza.&#xD;
But numbers were against the success of&#xD;
Mr. Snodgrass, who-with his second, Mrs.&#xD;
Betsy Peck-was soon overpowered, h be-&#xD;
ing almost beaten and trampled to death,&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
Had not the American consul and a high offi-&#xD;
cer of the Chilian government, who were pass-&#xD;
ing with M1. Van Ness and Monsieur Las-&#xD;
celles, at that moment arrived, and interfered&#xD;
when they were recognized, the unfortunate&#xD;
Snodgrass would have been killed on the&#xD;
spot ; and perhaps Mrs. Betsy would have&#xD;
met the same fate.&#xD;
As it was, no interference could save- them&#xD;
from being borne to prison, which, in truth,&#xD;
was about the safest place for them at that&#xD;
moment, such was the intense excitement&#xD;
which they had raised.&#xD;
There, under the care of a surgeon which&#xD;
the consul had sent to attend to their wounds,&#xD;
Mr. Snodgrass had time to mournfully delib-&#xD;
erate upon the expediency of interfering with&#xD;
the religious belief and customs of others,&#xD;
and the policy of raising a free fight with tlE&#xD;
odds against him.&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
All night the schooner had been slowly and&#xD;
quietly gliding in toward the land, and much&#xD;
of it had been spent by both Ethelbert and&#xD;
Ernest on deck--for not a cloud obscured the&#xD;
sky, and they had the light of a full moon,&#xD;
so brilliant, that scarce a star could be seen.&#xD;
In truth, it was almost as light as day ; and,&#xD;
through their glasses, the captain and his&#xD;
young friend could distinctly trace the line&#xD;
of undulating coast, the tall mountain peaks&#xD;
back-the valleys ranging up among them,&#xD;
wooded with palm and cocoa-nut, and many&#xD;
other beautiful trees of that gorgeous clime.&#xD;
It was only at the suggestion of Ethelbert&#xD;
that both would be better fitted to enjoy&#xD;
pleasure, and attend to duty on the morrow,&#xD;
if they had sonic rest, that Ernest relin-&#xD;
quished the deck for his state-room: and both&#xD;
had not slept more than two or three hours&#xD;
at most, when the steward aroused them for&#xD;
breakfast, and the first mate announced that&#xD;
they were on soundings.&#xD;
"How near to the shore, Mr. Tyrrell?"&#xD;
asked Ethelbert, who, in nautical parlance,&#xD;
had "turned in all standing."  In other&#xD;
words, had ;lain down with his clothes on-&#xD;
and was up the instant he was called.&#xD;
"About six or eighttniles, sir," replied the&#xD;
mate.&#xD;
"How much water have we under the keel?"&#xD;
"About eighteen fathoms now, sir--at the&#xD;
cast before the last, sixty; and the 'east be-&#xD;
fore that, twenty. The 'ottom is as uneven&#xD;
as the face of a pock-marked nagut."&#xD;
"Ay, we must keep a good look-out. Go&#xD;
on deck, and tell Mr. Tabor to have the lead&#xD;
cast every five minutes ; after breakfast, I&#xD;
will take the deck, and see if I can't pick out&#xD;
an anchorage."&#xD;
The morning meal was soon dispatched ;&#xD;
and after that, the captain had all handed&#xD;
