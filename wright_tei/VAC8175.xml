CHAPTER 1.&#xD;
"And 'mId f~air hills where cultivation smiles,&#xD;
The Connecticut, white with sunlit sails,&#xD;
Flows down and up with his unwearying tides."&#xD;
FLOW on gently, noble river, as thou hast done&#xD;
from the beginning, ever faithful keeper of the secrets&#xD;
entrusted to thy bosom! What tales could'st thou&#xD;
not tell us of human joy and human sorrow; of&#xD;
want,~ wretchedness and wo; of tragedies that would&#xD;
chill the heart's warm life-blood at its source; and&#xD;
think God for the blessed gift, thou could'st tell us&#xD;
also of human love, pure, deep, fervent as that&#xD;
ushered in on the first Christmas morn.&#xD;
Beside thy still waters have lived and died earth's&#xD;
nameless heroes, saints t~nd sages, pure and humble&#xD;
spirits that have won victories grander than were&#xD;
ever achieved on battle-field; from thy verdant banks&#xD;
*     the unlettered savage and the civilized Thritan have&#xD;
raised their dgly orisons to God; and here also have&#xD;
*     wrestled 'in deadly conflict the vengeful ire of the&#xD;
Anglo-Saxon 'and the vengeful ire of the hunted&#xD;
Indian, ~s the native child of the forest vainly strove&#xD;

&#xD;
to defend his ancient home from the grasp of his&#xD;
remorseless, but victorious foe.&#xD;
But it is not of scenes like these we ask thy records&#xD;
now,-no thrilling tale of heroic deeds; startling&#xD;
adventure or disappointed love. It is the simple&#xD;
record of the human soul in common life, affected&#xD;
by no extraordinary incidents save such as fall to&#xD;
the lot of all.&#xD;
Now that the age of Puritan bigotry has passed,&#xD;
one may breathe freely while treading the field of&#xD;
romance. Reverently let us judge those stern vir-&#xD;
tues whence superstition s~)rung as the natural reac-&#xD;
tion of the spiritual despotism that seiit from the&#xD;
church the children of her own faith, to seek in aus-&#xD;
terity an antidote to the universal corruption from&#xD;
which they had fled. Shocked by the heartlessness&#xD;
of the forms they had b on taught to regard as wor-&#xD;
ship, and still more by ti e hypocrisy that enthroned&#xD;
itself in church and stat as the supreme Head to&#xD;
wIii~h all must swear all glance, they looked upon&#xD;
life as one sublime but ful reality, presenting no&#xD;
middle ground, aiming at one sole, absolute purpose,&#xD;
to escape the terrors of hell by obtaining the blessed-&#xD;
ness of heaven. For this should prayer and praise&#xD;
be raised, the ritual observed, and good works per-&#xD;
formed.&#xD;
Whatever pertained to the pleasures of this life,&#xD;
* aside from that one ultimate object, was considered&#xD;
too trivial, if not too sinful, to engage the attention&#xD;
of immortal beings, with such a momentous future&#xD;
before them. What were, our earthly sufferings,&#xD;
either physical or mental, magnified, to the extent of&#xD;
&#xD;
CONNECTICUT.&#xD;
&#xD;
7t&#xD;
&#xD;
our imagination, co~ipared to the miseries which&#xD;
one lost soul must endure through ages and ages of&#xD;
eternity, beyond what the imagination can conceive?&#xD;
The rigor with which 'they sought to enforce this idea&#xD;
fostered the very evils they sought to eradicate.&#xD;
By separating the ~sthetic from the moral and&#xD;
religious, by cultivating one faculty at the expense&#xD;
of another, aiid setting up their own standard as the&#xD;
infallible test for all, they ranged bigotry and super~&#xD;
station on the one side ,-unrestrained vulgarity and&#xD;
licentiousness on the other. In banishing from their&#xD;
houses all fictitious works in order to avoid contami-&#xD;
nation with what was low and sensual in them, they&#xD;
could not banish imagination .nor repi'ess the mnag-&#xD;
netism of human nature, which'would find expression&#xD;
through such sources as the public patronage per-&#xD;
mitted. If denied access to the pure and virtuous,&#xD;
it would eater to the ~prejudices of the thoughtless&#xD;
and profane.&#xD;
One of the greatest instri~mentalities of moral&#xD;
and religious instruction exists under the name of&#xD;
fiction6 Its office consists in bringing us to a more&#xD;
intimate acquaintance with human nature, not, so&#xD;
much to pliilosophizO upon it as to present it as it&#xD;
is, leaving the reader to draw his own inferences.&#xD;
It reveals the secret springs of human action, upon&#xD;
which, more than upon public deeds and military&#xD;
prowess hangs the fate of nations. By appealing&#xD;
directly to the feelings, the heart is touched when&#xD;
the intellect would never be reached 'by logic. A&#xD;
truth is often uuconsc~ouslj~ imbibed under the gor-&#xD;
geous coloring of the imagination, when it would find&#xD;

no response if presented from the'simple stand-point&#xD;
of right and duty. Jesus recognized this principle&#xD;
when he. imparted his great lessons in the form of&#xD;
parables, to which the com~non people listened&#xD;
gladly.&#xD;
The human ~ou1 is merely a repetitlon of itself in&#xD;
different combinations, under different circumstances.&#xD;
The child of to-day must .pass through the same&#xD;
mental, moral and physical discipline to learn the&#xD;
use of his muscles, subdue his passions and train his&#xD;
intellect,~-is guided by the same instinct to distin~&#xD;
guish right from wrong, as in the days when Cain&#xD;
slew his brother, and sought~ to conceal his guilt by&#xD;
attempting to deceive his Maker.&#xD;

those individual convulsions that rouse every passion&#xD;
and set in motion every latent power of the soul,&#xD;
I)ut in solitude and seclusion can we trace from phases&#xD;
of our oxvn experience, how a word lightly spoken&#xD;
may stir the depths of a nature usually placid as the&#xD;
gentle summer breeze, so deeply as to reveal those&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
"Oh! if the soul immortal be,&#xD;
Is not its love immortal too?"&#xD;
Partiahl~ sheltered from observation, in a recess in&#xD;
oiie of the most elegant and luxuriously furnished&#xD;
apartments a New England city could l)oast, recently&#xD;
enriched ny some of the liio'hest productions of lite-&#xD;
rature and art that a refined taste cultured by a few&#xD;
years residence in Europe could select, sat a gentle-&#xD;
man and lady engaged in earnest conversation. A&#xD;
brilliant assemblage bad gathered there, wealth and&#xD;
beauty dazzled the eye xvith their gorgeous splendor,&#xD;
a Ii(1 uninterrupted festivity ruled the hour. These&#xD;
two guests heeded not the airy forms flitting by, the&#xD;
voluptuous swell of the music, or the fascinating&#xD;
mazes of the dance. Subjects of graver and deeper&#xD;
importance, and of surpassing interest, to them&#xD;
en grossed their thoughts.&#xD;
It Was a time when theological strife ran at its&#xD;
greatest heio'ht, and every man, woman and child&#xD;
enlisted as combatants. So perverted and distorted&#xD;
had become every opinion upon the sul~ject that tile&#xD;
individual who stood outside the conflict, in closer&#xD;
communion with nature's teachings than with the&#xD;
scholastic essays of th~c divin of;, might hi ave been wel-&#xD;
comed, if not as a harbinger of salvation, at least as&#xD;
(10)&#xD;
&#xD;
a lallacea that would help to allay the ~fierce contend~&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
Society was composed then, as now, of every grade&#xD;
~nd shade of opinion,~from the outspoken tenets of&#xD;
I,       Calvinism to the milder and more poetic sway of that&#xD;
unconscious relirioas fervor, which captivates and&#xD;
moulds by the consistency of its own life rather than&#xD;
by the profession of creeds. Men there were whose&#xD;
austerity in morals shut out every ray of social&#xD;
warmth; women whose more secluded lives led to&#xD;
greater concentration of thought and purpose, but&#xD;
whose greater depth of feeling counteracted the&#xD;
stoicism of the philosopher, and led them to crucify&#xD;
their affections upon th~ alter of a life-long martyr-&#xD;
dom.&#xD;
There were others whose dogmas were laid on .the&#xD;
shelf for particular occasions, from whom uncon~&#xD;
sciously flowed that spirit of charity and tolerance&#xD;
which saw in every man a friend and brother, ready&#xD;
~o recognize him as a co-worker in any noble cause&#xD;
that had for its aim th~ elevation of humanity.&#xD;
Sometimes maternal fondness overpoxved. every other&#xD;
emotion, and the joyous laugh and festive dance&#xD;
assumed quite another character iyhen mothers saw&#xD;
their own children among the merry participants.&#xD;
Put oftener, under the overshadowing wings of a&#xD;
Puritan ancestry all the tender amenities of life were&#xD;
hidden beneath the rigid crust of doctrine and belief&#xD;
whence, only occasionally', they flower out like some&#xD;
Vare, exotic plant, the richer for its culture.&#xD;
To such influences, doubtless, is mainly owing the&#xD;
sti~ength of New England character. While other&#xD;

safely in the haydn of universal toleration without&#xD;
regard to clime, c~lor, sex or condition, recognizing&#xD;
only the brotherhood of the human race.&#xD;
Alfred Claremont and Marianne Beaufort might&#xD;
have been called the representatives of the two anti-&#xD;
podes of theology and religion. She was emphati-&#xD;
cally acliild of nature. Her parents died when she&#xD;
was very young, leaving her to the care of a maiden&#xD;
sister of her father, who, if she did not enter so&#xD;
readily as some into the sports of children, or under-&#xD;
stand so well the thousand little wants of their&#xD;
minds, certainly possessed one eminent quality, that&#xD;
of caring for their physical education.&#xD;
She allowed her free exercise in the open air, and&#xD;
never iiiterfered with her own choice of eI~joyment.&#xD;
There was not a hill or valley, wood or stream, for&#xD;
miles around that she had not explored. Possessing&#xD;
a healthy, happy temperament, and a contemplative&#xD;
mind, she grew and e4pand~d into luxurious bloom&#xD;
under the ,joyous, cloudless sky of nature, through&#xD;
which she looked up to God as a tender, loving&#xD;
Father, who had wade this earth so rich in beauty&#xD;
and so lavish in its gifts to luau.&#xD;
Her spiritual organization was such that it. was&#xD;
safer to trust her to her own instincts than t~ at-&#xD;
tempt to control it, and she had never met with those&#xD;
conflicting influences that so me times warp and harm&#xD;
&#xD;
a child's nature more than positive neglect would do.&#xD;
0&#xD;
Having, no young corupaniolls at home she was per-&#xD;
haps more reserved and thoughtful than sh~ would&#xD;
otherwise have been, but this circumstance did not&#xD;
cast a shadow over her happiness, which she diffused&#xD;
Wherever she moved by the magic influence of her&#xD;
pl~esenCC, the radiance of her inner self.&#xD;
During one of those lingering twilight that grace&#xD;
the early autumn she had retreated to a favorite&#xD;
grove, where, under the blue canopy of heaven,&#xD;
eardi, air and the deep blue river blended in one&#xD;
~we~t accord, to swell the rapturous emotion of her&#xD;
owli soul and breathe their soothing influences over&#xD;
another, whose stern mental conflicts had of late&#xD;
* dimmed for him the brightness of the material as well&#xD;
as Pie spiritual world. Unconscious of each other's&#xD;
1)resence, although but a few rods apart, until they&#xD;
accidental exchanged glances as both turned to&#xD;
leave, the momentary impression made upon him&#xD;
was not exactly that of a Puritan maiden, for she&#xD;
was not rigid enough in thought and feQling for that,&#xD;
but of one whose purity ~f thought and feeling&#xD;
shone through every feature so strikingly as to arrest&#xD;
his attention. Her image remained vivid in his&#xD;
mind, not from any expectation of seeing her again,&#xD;
but for its association with his own peaceful feelings&#xD;
that evening, which contrasted so happily with his&#xD;
previous hours of skepticism and despair. No&#xD;
romance had ever tortured him with its idle dreams,,&#xD;
for life had been too stern a reality.&#xD;
He was an Englishman by birth, the youngest soil&#xD;
of a wealthy merchant, and had been attracted to&#xD;

&#xD;
A TALE OF THE&#xD;
&#xD;
our shores partly from a love of novelty, but more&#xD;
from sympathy with our democratic institutions.&#xD;
His att~ntioii was first arrested by a consideration of&#xD;
the laws of primogeniture which seemed to him so&#xD;
absolutely absurd and unjust, that in seeking to trace&#xD;
their origin for some show of reason upon which&#xD;
they could rest, he was led to a general review of all&#xD;
governments; both human and divine, ~which could&#xD;
end only with a recoiistruction of his former views&#xD;
and opinions. Educated into the most rigid tenets&#xD;
of the church of England, whi cli he repudiated as&#xD;
his mind expanded, lie was now passing through that&#xD;
dark period when the soul, relinquishing the dead&#xD;
letter which it has been taught to regard as the life-&#xD;
giving ~soiirce of religious inspiration, is loosed from&#xD;
its moorings, and drifts about on the fathomless&#xD;
ocean of its own conjectures and reasoning crc it&#xD;
reaches in safety the other shore.&#xD;
The spiritual element must be felt, it cannot be&#xD;
demonstrated. Vain is the most glowing rhetoric to&#xD;
hini whose intuitions have not unlocked those sub-&#xD;
lime realities of the unseen' world which the human&#xD;
intoiject alone can never grasp or unfold. An in-&#xD;
fluence more~ subtle than mere words can diffuse&#xD;
convoys the higher knowledge of the soul, which she&#xD;
selects according to the laws of affinity, making' the&#xD;
b&#xD;
meat for one poison for another, from the inability of&#xD;
the one to comprehend the language of the other.&#xD;
In rejecting a rigid code of belief there is often a&#xD;
tendency to materialism and skepticism. Reason is&#xD;
a safe guide when it has a stand-point; otherwise it&#xD;
is like a ship without a rudder. When a doctrine&#xD;
&#xD;
has been enforced upon it as an essential article of&#xD;
religious faith which it could never reconcile with&#xD;
itself, it begins to question whether there is any&#xD;
such principle as religious faith, and what its value&#xD;
to the soul when it involves such absurdities. Its&#xD;
proper function is to search out and eradicate those&#xD;
errors of opinion that conflict with the spiritual per-&#xD;
ceptions, by which we recognize certain truths inde-&#xD;
pendent of the intellect, but harmonizing with it,&#xD;
being the highest development of the innate con-&#xD;
sciousness we call faith, which is the ijatural endow-&#xD;
ment of every living soul. It is manifest in the&#xD;
child when he runs to his mother for protection be-&#xD;
fore he has learned to lisp her name; in man, in the&#xD;
confidence with which lie looks forward to the fulfil-&#xD;
ment of every relation of the material universe&#xD;
towards him as a dependent on its bounty. In its&#xD;
highest manifestation forming the basis of the roli~&#xD;
gious sentiments, lt is no m6re to' be confounded&#xD;
with belief than theology with religion. One per-&#xD;
taiiis 'to the intellect and is as diversified as the&#xD;
human mind, the other is the divine~ illumination by&#xD;
which alone we ascend to a knowledge of' things&#xD;
divine, and feel the glow oP the ineffable love that&#xD;
gilds life's saddest hours with a foretaste 'of the&#xD;
blessedness of immortality. Belief is the mental&#xD;
result of the effort to reduce it to a system, and&#xD;
varies with the progressive stages of civilization. It&#xD;
can no more change its essential nature than the&#xD;
different modes of training a child can affect the,&#xD;
nature of parental love.&#xD;

When skepticism ran highest in the mind of Alfred&#xD;
Claremont, came one of those inward revelations,&#xD;
one of those floods of light with which the darkest&#xD;
moments of human wisdom are sometimes uAdo&#xD;
luminous with a halo of celestial inspiration.&#xD;
The loveliness of this autumn sunset sent its ray&#xD;
of light and cheer to herald the dawn of morning&#xD;
twilight upon his dreary night of doubt and uncer-&#xD;

up like an oasis in the desert to revive and stron~then&#xD;

And if over all we feel the sympathy of a kindred&#xD;

Not many months afterwards both these individuals&#xD;
met at the house of ~i mutual friend, who, on his&#xD;

return from Europe had prepared an entertainment&#xD;
for the reception of his numerous acquaintances,&#xD;
which rivalled in splendor any previous event of the&#xD;
kind in that city. At a table which literally bloomed&#xD;
with the rarest and most beautiful flowers it was&#xD;
possible to obtain in mid-winter, a casual remark&#xD;
attracted Mr. Claremont's attention ; which imme-&#xD;
diately revealed to him his unknown companion in&#xD;
the grove. The recognition was mutual, needing not&#xD;
the formality of an introduction, and thus coma&#xD;
menced a friendship of equal benefit to both parties.&#xD;
It was a fortunate thing for him at this time to come&#xD;
in contact with a person resting so calmly in the&#xD;
'bosom of God's love as did Marianne Beaufort. She&#xD;
needed not to be told that God is,-she felt hi~&#xD;
presence in every breeze that fanned her brow, in the&#xD;
murmur of the forest, iii the sparkling rivulet at her&#xD;
feet. It was the all pervading element of her nature,&#xD;
the focus in which concentrated every other emotion~&#xD;
whether in solitude, or surrounded by the votaries&#xD;
of the world.&#xD;
If she could not' alxvays meet his arguments, her&#xD;
faith and trust were never for a moment shaken., and&#xD;
the confiding assuraiice with which she looked for~&#xD;
ward to the solution of all his problems forced him&#xD;
to acknowledge the supremacy of that instinct which&#xD;
trusts before it can understand, over all the dedu~-&#xD;
tions of logic.&#xD;
This was just what he needed. The fervent,&#xD;
longing aspiration of his soul could not bc met by&#xD;
argument. He had had enough of that. '1~he reW&#xD;
gious sentiment was strong within him, and required&#xD;

A student of human nature might have been&#xD;
interested in the physiognomy of the two. In con~&#xD;
nection with a well developed physical organization,&#xD;
though of rather irregular features, which, however,&#xD;
did not detract from the general air of refinement&#xD;
he inspired, he had a high, full forehead, eyes so&#xD;
varying in their expression as to reveal every Omo-&#xD;
tion of his soul, a firm set mouth indicating decision&#xD;
of character, about which there played a tender&#xD;
smile, not the evanescent passion of the moment, but&#xD;
habitualr-the index of a highly sensitive nature.&#xD;
She had a finely moulded , graceful form, syrnmet~&#xD;
rical features, large, lustrous hazel eyes, full of mean-&#xD;
ing and earnestness; long, silken ~yelashes, and&#xD;
eyebrows of the same shade, as delicately curved as&#xD;
if drawn by a pencil; soft brown hair that shaded a&#xD;
well developed brow; an exquisitely formed mouth&#xD;
wbich, when at rest, bore the faintest image of a&#xD;
smile as if giving kittera.nce to her own happy&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;
Though beautiful she was not brilliant. Possessing&#xD;
a mind of uncommon cultivation, she made no clis~&#xD;
play of it for the admiration of others. To be&#xD;
a.dmred she must be drawn out, not by a mere&#xD;
casual observation, but by some real, earnest thQught&#xD;
striking the chord of sympathy within, when it&#xD;
would vibrate to the slightest touch. Mr. Claremont&#xD;
was fortunate enough to touch this chord and it re-&#xD;

*     Fortunately or unfortunately, an acquaintance of&#xD;
this kind, a friendship founded on the most serious&#xD;

emotions.&#xD;
On a bright May morning the following spring,&#xD;
Marianne returned i~rom her accustomed walk with&#xD;
a basket full of her favorite flower, that modest&#xD;
spring beauty, th~ trailing arbutus. Having arranged&#xD;
it for her table in the loose, careless manner she&#xD;
liked best to see it, she collected the finest, largest&#xD;
specimens which she had reserved, in a bouquet. The&#xD;
morning 1)~J away before it was completed, and.&#xD;
one might perceive by the unusual care manifested&#xD;
in its arrangement that something more than fancy&#xD;
was nerving her fingers to the task.&#xD;
First she gave it a cone-shaped appearance, but&#xD;
that looked too stiff, and they were all speedily sepa-&#xD;
rated and arranged in an umbel form, which struck&#xD;
her as being as far the other way, and it is uncertain&#xD;
how inaiiy more attempts sh~ would have made had&#xD;
not the door bell rung just as she had completed it&#xD;

The first-born! who can define the world of sensa-&#xD;

soul, language is powerless to express it, imagination&#xD;
hi its loftiest range comes far short of reality. Others&#xD;
may come to share an equal love,-.-none to excite&#xD;
the same novelty of emotion. The numerous little&#xD;

Rosahind, perhaps, was not a child of remarkable&#xD;
talent in any given direction, but she was certainly&#xD;
an original child. 'She neither resembled other&#xD;
children, nor imitated herself. She was constantly&#xD;
unfolding some new trait of character, and present-&#xD;

bined his logical with her mother's contemplative&#xD;
powers. Every thing that came under her observe~&#xD;
tion was subjected to the strictest scrutiny for its&#xD;
why and wherefore. Nev~r weary in her restless&#xD;
activity, she was constantly puzzling that little brain&#xD;
with questions oftentimes beyond the comprehension&#xD;
of ini~ch older heeds. She c~~mbined the dignity of&#xD;
the woman with the artlessness of the child. Appealed&#xD;
to through the -reason and the affections, she was&#xD;
gentle and. yielding as a snow-flake; approached with&#xD;
a command, or a request that did not suggest its&#xD;
own reason, she was firm and unbending as the oak.&#xD;
For her father she always manifested a most un-&#xD;
common affection, reluctantly submitting to a~~y&#xD;
other control, and never was a person better fitted&#xD;
for such a trust than he. He had early perceived&#xD;
* her peculiar traits, and the immense importance&#xD;
resting on her early culture for her fixture happiness&#xD;
and usefulness. She must have a sphere for her&#xD;
activity, or she would grow up a fretful, impatient,&#xD;
discontented woman. She must be guided by a gen~&#xD;
tIe, yet firm and steady hand, to bring into harmony&#xD;
the opposing tendencies of her choxacter, or they&#xD;
might neutralize the good she would otherwise&#xD;
accomplish. It was a delightful task to him to study&#xD;
o~it her original propensities, and observe the latent&#xD;
germs of future promise whose develop inent might&#xD;
some day require his most careful attention. He&#xD;
often felt that he was instructed as well as amused&#xD;
by the unaffected simplicity she displayed in the&#xD;
perception and correction of her own faults. The,&#xD;

Great patience and discrimination are require~ to&#xD;

well-balance~l character; and when they sh~1l be re-&#xD;

instead of being the servaht of their moral nature.&#xD;
Mr. Clarcmbnt quite thoPoughly un derstooci this&#xD;
principle, as well from experience as from observa-&#xD;

security of obedience between a peremptory c0m-&#xD;

in a~ fit of impatience she struck her mother who was&#xD;
standing by. Just then her father entered. Though&#xD;
neitheP of them said a word, her manlier at once&#xD;
* indicated that she knew she had forfeited his accus-&#xD;
tomed kiss. After dinner, instead of returning to&#xD;
her playthings as usual when her father left, she sat&#xD;
with her hands quietly resting in her~ap for ahuost&#xD;
the first time in her life, or stood gazing thoughtfully&#xD;
out at the window. She w~s evidently in a dilemma,&#xD;
and was exerting all the powers of her mind to ex-&#xD;
tricate herself from it. Love was the very centre of&#xD;
her existence, and especially she could not live with-&#xD;
out her father's kiss. As tile hour drew near for his&#xD;
return she went up softly to her mother, and said in&#xD;
a low voice, "Mother, I want to kiss you."&#xD;
After receiving the proffered kiss, observing that&#xD;
she still stood with her large, wondering blue eyes&#xD;
fixed upon her, she said, "What is it, Rosa, what&#xD;
do you want to say?"&#xD;
Loaning her head a little on one side, still looking&#xD;
wistfully at her, she answered, "I wish you would&#xD;
say it., mother, I can't."&#xD;
"Say what, Rosa, that you are sorry you struck&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"Yes, yes, mother, that's it," and, evidently with&#xD;
a feeling ~of great relief she ran to the window to&#xD;
watch for her father. When she saw him coming,&#xD;
instead of running to meet him she retreated to the&#xD;
sofa, which was her plac~ of refuge in every emer-&#xD;
gency.&#xD;
Seeing that she showed no disposition to come for-&#xD;
ward as he entered the room and that he did not&#xD;
&#xD;
notice her; her mother, who had attentively observed&#xD;
her actions all the afternoon, said to him, "I think&#xD;
Rosa is waiting for a kiss from her father."&#xD;
As he approached she did not move or speak, but&#xD;
fixed upon him an arch, inquisitive expression as if&#xD;
sure of 'reading in his countenance a confirmation of&#xD;
her own consciousness of having solved a great&#xD;
problem.&#xD;
When he asked her what she had done with her&#xD;
boat, she drew herself up with the air of one whose&#xD;
sense of dignity has been offended ,.and said,&#xD;
"Father ycu will please not to say anything more&#xD;
about it."&#xD;
Why," said he, "I want to explain it to~ you, so&#xD;
you will see what was the reason it would not sail as&#xD;
you expected. Now will you get it and let us ex-&#xD;
amine it? "&#xD;
"No, it is where I cannot g~t it," speaking with&#xD;
as much decision as if she had been the parent, ahd&#xD;
he the child, "and so we may as welIdrop the sub-&#xD;
* ject, it isn't pleasant."&#xD;
"I think it is. I should take a great deal of&#xD;
pleasure in showing my little daughter how it differs&#xD;
from a real steamboat, and I think she will be far&#xD;
happier to receive it back to her favor as we have&#xD;
received her to onr~."&#xD;
With a suppressed smile and much more 'of hu-&#xD;
mility in her tone, she replied,&#xD;
"I, will show you where it is, if you will get it for&#xD;
me~&#xD;
Under tile attic stairs was a large, dark closet, the&#xD;
general receptacle of such miscellaneous articles as&#xD;

collect in every hou ehold, where, behind barrels and&#xD;
boxes the offendin~ boat was found. They were.&#xD;
* soon both engaged &amp;amp;ith so much enthusiasm as to&#xD;
remind one of some important interest like the Thip-&#xD;
'ping of a valuable c ajrgo rather than the mere amuse-&#xD;
ment of a child. Perhaps it was more important,&#xD;
for who can calcul~tte the result of the slightest im-&#xD;
pression made on the susceptible mind of the child?&#xD;
IRosalind's happiness was very much augmented&#xD;
when Walter, her little brother, three years younger&#xD;
than herself, grew old enough to share her sports,&#xD;
and receive her instruction. She was never satisfied&#xD;
with doing a thing for its own sake. She must have&#xD;
an object, a purpose. To impart to him the knowl-&#xD;
edge she gained, furnished, a double motive for&#xD;
acquiring it.&#xD;
Her strong will sought a mastery over the foi~Aes&#xD;
of the child's intellect, in her eager desire for the&#xD;
attainments belonging to years and experience, and&#xD;
she could not patiently submit to the law of growth&#xD;
and development; but her aiThetions, trusting the&#xD;
love she knew was seeking her best welfare, prompted&#xD;
her to unquestioned obedience, and sirn tried to rec~&#xD;
oncile the two. She would have had less reverence&#xD;
for her father if he had been less exacting, or lowered&#xD;
the standard to which he proposed to bring her.&#xD;
Engaged in one pf her puzzling explorations in&#xD;
her f~tther's presence, wheii Walter was scarcely old&#xD;
enough to talk, she tried in vain to enlist his sympa-&#xD;
thy, and theii vented her vexation upon him by&#xD;
reproaching him for his stupidity.&#xD;
Mr. Claremont bade her leave the room till sho&#xD;
&#xD;
could treat him properly. Looking up to see if there&#xD;
was 110 alternative, she ran out in great haste closing&#xD;
!j~ the door not very gently. The next moment she&#xD;
'~ opened it just far enough to put her head through,&#xD;
and said pertly, "Father, I don't love you." About&#xD;
half an hour after she entered with a soft, light step,&#xD;
and intruding her curly head before the paper he&#xD;
j wa~s reading, looked in his face with groat affec-&#xD;
tion, saying, " Oh, father, I do love you," and put&#xD;
her arms around his neck for tile pardoning kiss.&#xD;
She looked for reproof oftentimes when she did&#xD;
not get it, and was very jealous of any given to&#xD;
Walter. It required the nicest discrimination to&#xD;
know when to observe, and when to pass by those&#xD;
many faults, which, noticed too often, would have&#xD;
discouraged her efforts to overcome them; and with-&#xD;
out sufficient and judicious restraint would have&#xD;
produced a capricious but self-willed character.&#xD;
Doubtles~ many were suffered to go unrebuked, that&#xD;
would have been deemed worthy of censure in Wal-&#xD;
ter. She knew it.&#xD;
Hearing her father reprove him once for something&#xD;
comparatively trivial, she looked up from the kitten&#xD;
she was ~arraying in a wreath of clover blossoms,&#xD;
saying, " Why father, I have done worse than tivat a&#xD;
great many times, and you didn't say anything to me&#xD;
for it."&#xD;
He was always firm in exacting her obedience to&#xD;
;~. what she knew to be his wish; but it was through~&#xD;
love, not fear, he gained h~r submission. Qnce ho&#xD;
counteracted hmi~ decision, which, she frequently said&#xD;
in after life, made one of the greatest impressions&#xD;

A TALE OF THE&#xD;
&#xD;
ever received,-.4t w~1s so unexpected. *She was&#xD;
iii the habit of throwing . her playthings at i~andom&#xD;
when any thing puzzled or vexed her. It grieved&#xD;
her as much as it did her parents, but when a fit of&#xD;
vexation came over her it was done quick as thought.&#xD;
She had a beautiful, large wax doll which she&#xD;
handled with the greatest care. One day in her&#xD;
absence, a child who was visiting there got hold of it&#xD;
and disfigured it sadly, besides tearing its delicate&#xD;
garments in shreds.&#xD;
The sight of it in this plight, being the first inti-&#xD;
mation she had of the misfortune that had befallen&#xD;
it, was too much for her. having a pair of scissors&#xD;
in her hand, she tI irew them with all the force she&#xD;
could qxert across the room where Walter happened&#xD;
to be. Fortunately he escaped with no injury but a&#xD;
slight graze up~on the cheek. She rushed into her&#xD;
father's ~arms and burst into tears, a thing unusual&#xD;
for her. "01, Rosa," said he, " I cannot let you go&#xD;
to ride with u to night."&#xD;
This was a reat privation, 'for there was nothing&#xD;
she enjoyed in re than their summer evening drives,&#xD;
but she bore it bravely until she saw him leavii~g tile&#xD;
house, when she burst out crying again, and said,&#xD;
"Oh father, won't you kiss me before you go? I&#xD;
want to kiss you." As he returned she threw her&#xD;
arms so lovingly around his neck that he was over~&#xD;
come, and recollecting that mercy xvas coeval with&#xD;
justice, he told her to get ready and she might go.&#xD;
She looked' at him with astonishment, then with joy&#xD;
sparkling through th~e tears in her eyes, soon joined&#xD;
&#xD;
them. Her little hands were ever tractable after&#xD;
that.&#xD;
It was her peculiar characteristic to avoid every&#xD;
thing of unpleasant associations. Th~ doll was en-&#xD;
tirely negiocted, and sadly as she missed it she never&#xD;
spoke of her loss. A poor child once enlisted her&#xD;
sympathies so much that. she begged the privilege to&#xD;
give it to j~er, but upon going to get it, the thought&#xD;
of parting with it forever revived her old attachment,&#xD;
and she replaced it affectionately, telling her mother&#xD;
that it would seem very hard to her if she should&#xD;
want to, give her away because something had hap-&#xD;
pened to spoil her looks.&#xD;
After her father had tested ,her for six months, he&#xD;
brought her home a hew doll, quite equal to the&#xD;
other, which she received very graeidusly, and after&#xD;
re(rardino' it attentively some *~ said, ~&#xD;
b                  for      mlnuues,&#xD;
a look of serious concern,&#xD;
"Doii't you think the other Dolly would feel bad&#xD;
if she thought I loved this one best?"&#xD;
Now trials awaited her. Every new experience&#xD;
revived the old strife between the conflicting elements&#xD;
oIls her organization, and she had the battle to fight&#xD;
over again. It had been comparatively easy to yield&#xD;
when there was no opposing influence beyond herself.&#xD;
School brought its teniptations. Being controlled&#xD;
more through her intellect and affections than. by her&#xD;
moral sentiments she was far more the su~joct of&#xD;
surrounding influences than Walter. Passing from&#xD;
the constant supervision of her parents to the com-&#xD;
panionship of those who had not been so carefully&#xD;
guarded at home, she grew impatient of restraint,&#xD;

and her father saw with grief that he was losing&#xD;
something of the hold through which lie had gained&#xD;
her obedience without asserting his authority.&#xD;
Near the scl~ool she attended lived a very eccentric&#xD;
widow who seemed to have sworn eternal enmity to&#xD;
all children. She would not allow them to set foot&#xD;
on her premises, running out with a broom to drive&#xD;
them off, like a brood of chickens, if she sqxv them&#xD;
coming in the direction of her domain. This course&#xD;
frequently indicted them to little acts of depreda-&#xD;
tion which otherwise they would not have thought&#xD;
of. They lost no opportunity to annoy her, pelting&#xD;
her door with stones which were hurled back at&#xD;
the shortest notice; and the contest generally ended&#xD;
by her going after a policeman, but as she alway~&#xD;
told their of her intention, they were sure to be mis-&#xD;
sing when he arAved.&#xD;
Rosalind and her companions never joined this&#xD;
rude set, but they would si~ on the steps leading to&#xD;
her house, and if she failed to~ make her appearance&#xD;
soon began to sing, which brought her out with a&#xD;
vengeance, her gray hairs flying, as she never wore a&#xD;
cap, and her dress not by any means a la mode, so&#xD;
she presented a very unique appearance. Withal,&#xD;
the multiform'wrinkles into which she contracted her&#xD;
face when uttering her threats completed the picture,&#xD;

the view of Mr. Claremont. lie remonstrated with&#xD;
Rosalind and tried to persuade her not to go there,&#xD;
but his reasons were unsatisfactory. There was no&#xD;
intention of mischief, and it could not hurt her in&#xD;
any possible way to sit on Wer steps, and she was sure&#xD;
that, living such a lonely life, she otight to be very&#xD;
grateful to them for singing her a song occasionally.&#xD;
if it made her cross, it was her fault, not theirs.&#xD;
Thus she argued.&#xD;
HerYather was not a man to be trifled with. He&#xD;
forbade her going, which at first overawed her, but&#xD;
when she joined her companions, who, ~s soon as&#xD;
school was over urged her to go with them again,&#xD;
SilO held a council in her own mind, and decided that&#xD;
it was very arbitrary in him to deprive her of enjoy-&#xD;
ments which were not denied to others, arid she&#xD;
accompanied them, not, however, with a very keen&#xD;
sense of pleasure..&#xD;
At dinner, in answer to her father's inquiry if she&#xD;
had obeyed him, she replied, no, but she had not&#xD;
done any thing wrong or out of the way, she thought,&#xD;
and was very sorry he should think otherwise, 1~ut&#xD;
she could not help it. That little will had gained&#xD;
ascendency much faster than he thought, but lie did&#xD;
not forgot that he had been a child, or ~that grown&#xD;
people are as unwilling to submit to what seems to&#xD;
timin, oftentimes, the arbitrary demands of their&#xD;
Heavenly Fathei~,. and he maintaiiied his self-control.&#xD;
With a child's quick instinct she perceived the&#xD;
sacrifice of feeling it cost him to enforce her obe-&#xD;
dience, which was another proof of his tender love,&#xD;
~a love that could suffer as well as enjoy,-and her&#xD;

&#xD;
affection for him was thereby increased. Neither did&#xD;
she ever after manifest so much impatience when&#xD;
any thing baffled her-comprehension.&#xD;
The summer she was fifteen she passed under her&#xD;
father's tuition, which was a source of great enjoy-&#xD;
ment to both. 11cr cager desire to fathom every&#xD;
branch of science to which her investigating mind&#xD;
led her, was often~ the cause of great annoyance to&#xD;
her teachers, for the~r could not see why a girl need&#xD;
to ask so many questions, who would never have any&#xD;
~ise for her knowledge. She felt the injustice of the&#xD;
censures sometimes incurred by her inquisitiveness,&#xD;
and could scarceIy'~ brook with go.od grace the par-&#xD;
tiality that tolerated, seemingly with greater patience,&#xD;
the insensible questions of the most stupid boys.&#xD;
She did not understand the customs of society, far&#xD;
more prevalent then than now, assigning to manhood&#xD;
a career,-to womanhood, marriage or a blank.&#xD;
Whatever Mr. Claremont's views in this respect,&#xD;
he intended to gratify and assist Rosalind in prose-&#xD;
cuting her studies to the extent of his power. Though&#xD;
engaged in a large mercantile establishment, his&#xD;
financial ability and prompt business habits relieved&#xD;
him from many of the cares and perplexities attend-&#xD;
ing men of~ his class, so that he had more leisure to&#xD;
spend at home and devote to her thaii usual with&#xD;
business men. He was one of the small company of&#xD;
successful merchants who had a conscience that&#xD;
could not be wrapped up in his Sunday suit, and a&#xD;
religion that he carried into his counting room, prac-&#xD;
tising good will to mcii on six days out of the seven,&#xD;
thus saving his soul from the all-engrossing vacation~&#xD;
&#xD;
and anxieties of trade without detriment to his&#xD;
* worldly interests, and redeeming it from the neces-&#xD;
sity of doubting the old maxim, that honesty is&#xD;
ultimately the best policy under all circumstances.&#xD;
With him the acquisition of wealth was only a sec-&#xD;
ondary consideration, honorable as 'the means to an&#xD;
end, but not the end itself.&#xD;
Itis enough to make one shudder, wl~o steps for&#xD;
the first time out of the blissful ignorance of private&#xD;
life into the great maelstroom of intrigue and du-&#xD;
plicity, swallowing up th~ world at large. Specious&#xD;
promises ~nd reckless investments on the longest&#xD;
credit constitute the badge of trade; punctuality in&#xD;
the payment of debts as a moral duty passes at a&#xD;
discount, and the industrious mechanic, dependent&#xD;
on his daily labor, deprived of the comforts of life&#xD;
through the negligence or dishQnesty of his employer,&#xD;
considers society at best only a ~ombination 6f rogues.,&#xD;
and gives up in despair or resolves to try his own&#xD;
fortune by playing a game at the same table.&#xD;
a roomy being Rosalind's favorite science, was&#xD;
subject which called forth most the brilliance of her&#xD;
intellect. The wonders there unfolded were adapted&#xD;
to her ardent thirst for novelty and grandeur, and&#xD;
sufficient to engage the intense activity of her brain.&#xD;
She was fascinating to observe, when, on a keen&#xD;
frosty night, she came in with her father after they&#xD;
had been out to trace the constellations, her eyes&#xD;
beaming with delight and her cheeks glowing with~&#xD;
the rosy hues of health, a good model for a picture&#xD;

CONNECTICUT.             35&#xD;
&#xD;
She never possessed the quiet beauty of her&#xD;
mother; hers was father the expression of soul.&#xD;
When a great thought animated her, or some stirring&#xD;
emotion communicated its subtle enthusiam to her&#xD;
features, there was an irresistible charm that iliSOli-&#xD;
sibly atti~aeted all wl~o came, within reach of her&#xD;
influence. Her chief feature of physical beauty was&#xD;
her flaxen ringlets, yet her complexion was fair, and&#xD;
her eyes resembled her father's in expression. In&#xD;
no other particular was there any resemblance be-&#xD;
tween herself and any other member of the family.&#xD;
The same might also be said of her character, which&#xD;
was two4'old, but not deceptive. Exhibiting neither&#xD;
boldness or reserve, nature came forth in full measure,&#xD;
sometimes rushing on like some wild mountain&#xD;
stream, then like the calm summer ripple, gently and&#xD;
soothingly breathing its sweet message of rest and&#xD;
peace, as it was reflected from its owa quiet bosom.&#xD;
Such an organization is born to suffering from its&#xD;
want of harmony, but when this is once effected,&#xD;
there is a strength of character seldom displayed by&#xD;
a person of an even temperament naturally.&#xD;
Walter was an exception to this rule. Combining&#xD;
a healthy physical frame with a well balanced mental&#xD;
organization, he presented an example of a highly&#xD;
moral, deeply religious nature without those sharp&#xD;
angles which chequer ~he lives of most people with&#xD;
their alternate sunshine and shade, as thdy bear wit~&#xD;
ness to the decisive conflicts and victories throudi&#xD;
which they have triumphed.&#xD;
The following incident furnishes a good illustra-&#xD;
&#xD;
tion of his character. His teacher having occasion&#xD;
to leave the schoolroom for a short time, appQinted&#xD;
him monitor in his absence, cons~dcriug him the&#xD;
most trust-wortJ~y scholar he had. It was an unen-&#xD;
viabl&amp;amp; position, and one which confiiet~d with Walter's&#xD;
sense of honor to report the conduct of his fellows.&#xD;
One of the boy~ who had too much of the fun-loving&#xD;
disposition to le~ such an occasion go unimproved,&#xD;
and too much artfulness to allow himself to be caught&#xD;
in the trap he set for others, winked to his nearest&#xD;
companion who took~ the hint and jogged th~ elbow&#xD;
of a boy sitting before him writing. Never passiiig&#xD;
by an affro~mt without showing proper resentment, the&#xD;
latter rose hastily to grasp the offender, and upset&#xD;
the inkstand over his clean copy-book which landed&#xD;
in a little girl's lap in front of him, who began to cry&#xD;
at the dismal picture her new pink apron presented&#xD;
with its long streaks of jet, like so many black marks&#xD;
against its fair fame. There was a general titter&#xD;
throughout the rooxn as all sprung iimstantly to their&#xD;
feet to see what was happening. Just then the&#xD;
school-master entered,-poor, mortal being,-~vith&#xD;
the dignity becoming such a functionary, who cast&#xD;
some menacing frowns on the little miscreants in the&#xD;
quarter whence had originated this confusion, thus&#xD;
flinging an imputation at his boasted renown for&#xD;
securing good order and obedience, and also setting a&#xD;
snare which cost him a still greater loss to his reputa~&#xD;
tion ,-~the equilibrium of his temper. Addressing&#xD;
Walter, whose close }$roximity to the scene of action&#xD;
forced him to be an eye witness of the whole, but&#xD;
who alone remained unmoved, having neither. smiled&#xD;

nor spoken, he demanded .a full account of the occur-&#xD;
ence, with the names of the offenders; to which he&#xD;
replied that he had nothing to sa~r, and positively&#xD;
declined to give aiiy information.&#xD;
"You\ have nothing to say? and yet you know all&#xD;
about it, who and what have been the cause of this&#xD;
mischief, but refuse to tell me," giving him a look&#xD;
that Walter, brave as he was, trembled to encounter,&#xD;
~an angry, defiant look.&#xD;
"Answer me now, were you yourself concerned&#xD;
in it?&#xD;
"No, sir."&#xD;
"You confess to a knowledge of the facLs which&#xD;
you refuse to communicate, do you?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Then mind you, sir, the punishment that should&#xD;
have been the culprit's., shall be yours! "&#xD;
If ever there was a class of persons who need a&#xD;
double shareof patience in order to meet the respon-&#xD;
sibilities resting upon them, and , discharge them&#xD;
acceptably to themselves and the community, it is&#xD;
school-teachers. Entrusted with the n~oral and in-&#xD;
tellectual training of a score or two of juveniles,&#xD;
with all sorts of temperaments, and all sorts of bring-&#xD;
ing up, and some with no bringing up at all; some,&#xD;
so full of fun and rogu.ery that an attempt to repress&#xD;
them seems like turning nature~ out of her course;&#xD;
others, so obstinate that the most to be hoped for&#xD;
is sullenness, instead of submission, their parents the&#xD;
while watching with jealous eyes any assertion of&#xD;
authority which they have not seen fit to maintain;&#xD;
the person who successfully manages the hetero-&#xD;
&#xD;
generous elements without committiiig some errors,&#xD;
must be an uncommon adept in the science of human&#xD;
nature, and of remarkable self-control.&#xD;
Mr. ~crantum, unfortunately, was not above the&#xD;
ordinLary level of human endurance, but he was very&#xD;
conscientious, and, when led into an indiscretion,&#xD;
sought every means to make reparation, if it could&#xD;
be clone without weakening his authority. He felt&#xD;
the keenest reproof in Walter's future conduct which&#xD;
never manifested the least revengeful feeling; and&#xD;
he had gained an influence over the school that&#xD;
transcended his own.&#xD;
Those young souls had never seen such heroism&#xD;
before. They ~vere lost in silent admiration. Even&#xD;
the boy who gave the sly wink, though not 1)rave&#xD;
enough to come forward and save him, thereby losing&#xD;
the opportunity to gani ahuost equal honors, appre-&#xD;
ciated the young martyr-spirit that could suffer for&#xD;
others, and profited by the lesson thus taught him.&#xD;
When the term drew tb a close, anti the conne&amp;amp;&#xD;

All eyes were fixed on Walter, the unconscious&#xD;

him as one boisterous cheer proclaimed the end of&#xD;

sibilities, or of the world -and its hypocrisy than the&#xD;
pets left behind her, when, at the early age of six-&#xD;
teen, she confided all her prospects of earthly happi-&#xD;
ness to the keeping of another. Too young to, com-&#xD;
prehend the full nature of the new relation she had&#xD;
assumed, or scan the possibilities of the future, it&#xD;
was bnly the realization of youth's sunny dreams,&#xD;
enhanced by the rich treasure of aii added love. In&#xD;
reply to a suggestion made by a friend who knew&#xD;
Mr. Crawford much bettor than she did, that the law&#xD;
should be changed which vested the xvife's property&#xD;
in her husband at the moment of her marriage, thus&#xD;
exposing her needlessly to all the Vicissitudes of for-&#xD;
tune that business or speculation may incur, she&#xD;
spoke with a tone of indignation unusual to that&#xD;
gentle nature, " Do you think I would trust myself&#xD;
where I would not trust my property ? Whatever is&#xD;
mine shall be, my husband's ! " a pledge that was&#xD;
fulfilled very differently from what she anticipated.&#xD;
Not naturally an indulgent man, and being ten years&#xD;
the oldest, it was very easy to assume a control to&#xD;
which she unresistingly yielded. He might have&#xD;
been ordinarily kind if strong drink had not made&#xD;
him a tyrant.&#xD;
Always having borne a good reputation, and scorn-&#xD;
iiig drunkenness as if it had been a loathsome reptile,&#xD;
he prided himself greatly on being able to control&#xD;
his appetite; but, on joining a club of young men&#xD;
who met for convivkd purposes, he found the power&#xD;
of restraint passing away, and, lacking the strength&#xD;
toresist his associates, resolved to change his resi-&#xD;
dence.&#xD;
&#xD;
Though a great trial to the young wife, she fol-&#xD;
lowed him unsuspectingly, ignorant of any reasoit&#xD;
that could induce him to leave the home of her child-&#xD;
hood where they were so pleasantly situated. When&#xD;
* she ventured to make any inquiry, his manner in-&#xD;
stantly silenced her, without the wished for ~informa-&#xD;
tion. He hoped that* in leaving his old companions&#xD;
and the scene of his temptations he might break off&#xD;
his former habits and save his reputation which he&#xD;
regarded as the apple of his eye, from any imputa-&#xD;
tion by his old friends.&#xD;
Here he was mistaken. Although moderate drink-&#xD;
ing was fashionable, the world was not so stupid, as&#xD;
it never isj, to regard a man with quite so much fayor&#xD;
pfter he has begun to debase the god-like within him,&#xD;
* which it discovers much sooner than he is aware.&#xD;
For three months he struggled bravely with his&#xD;
appetite, and kept his resolution; but, alas! one of&#xD;
his old companions followed him here, and enticed&#xD;
him again to the terrible abyss whence he had appa-&#xD;
rently escaped. Knowing the weak side of his char-&#xD;
acter, and exaggerating the facts, heTersuaded him&#xD;
that it was a vain attempt to save the respectability&#xD;
already lost, for every body knew the reason of his&#xD;
sudden removal. A certain ingenuousness about Mix&#xD;
Crawford made him spurn hypocrisy, and these&#xD;
* words added to the humiliation already felt. That&#xD;
* proud spirit chafed under the galling thought of&#xD;
honor irretrievably gone, an~l his craving thirst for&#xD;
drink was too strong to be resisted by one whose&#xD;
controlling sentiment was pride rather than priiici-&#xD;
pie, and he fell never to rise again.&#xD;

* Late one evening, after losing heavily by gambling,&#xD;
be tried to drown his mortification and remorse by&#xD;
excessive indulgence, and came reeling home in a&#xD;
state of beastly intoxication. Being his wife's first&#xD;
suspicion of his l~abits, though she had often won-&#xD;
dered what kept him out so late, it gave her a stun-&#xD;
fling blow, which he had just sense enough to observe.&#xD;
* Maddened by the conviction that he had lost the last&#xD;
claim upon the love or reverence of any human be-&#xD;
ing, he vented his raging passions upon her and her&#xD;
sleeping babe.&#xD;
Mrs. Crawford lacked the strong will, which, if it&#xD;
might have made her more rebellious, would have&#xD;
helped her to rise above her fate, and her native re-&#xD;
finement and purity of character revolted at the life&#xD;
of degradation she must live with him. Like a fair&#xD;
and delicate floweP rudely transplanted from, the&#xD;
watm and genial breezed where it has been tenderly&#xD;
reared, she drooped and faded at the first rough&#xD;
wind. It was true she had shed mainly bitter tears&#xD;
that year as a gentle child ~1oes at t~ie occasional&#xD;
harshness of its parents, and then dries them again&#xD;
and smiles at the first pleasant word, but love always&#xD;
found some excuse in the pressure of business and&#xD;
its vexatious, and sought yet to be happy in striving&#xD;
to make him so.&#xD;
Suddenly hurled from the fond anticipations of&#xD;
the young wire and mother into the overwhelming&#xD;
depths of despair, she saw nothing before her but&#xD;
darkness and desolation. Every night she trembled&#xD;
at the sound of his footsteps, and every morning&#xD;
grew more hopeless and heartsick at sight of him.~&#xD;

Even the infant in her arms failed to arouse any&#xD;

our choicest treasures, it is never the lover to be&#xD;
wooed and won.&#xD;
About three niontlis after Amelia was born. When&#xD;
laid in her mother's arms, she turned her face away&#xD;
with a look and tone those present could never for-&#xD;
get, saying, " God forbid that she should live to suf-&#xD;
fer what I have suffered; better that she should&#xD;
never see the dawn of another day!" But Amelia&#xD;
was destined to live, to thank God for the life he had&#xD;
given her. She was a dull, spiritless child, yet a&#xD;
close observer could perceive that thQre was not so&#xD;
much lack of talent, as want of development. Her&#xD;
mother was too broken-hearted to infuse much ani-&#xD;
mation, which was very essential to such a passive&#xD;
nature as Amelia's. She was shy of every body, and&#xD;
her home, poor as it was, constituted her world, for&#xD;
it was all she knew of it. Mr. Crawford was now an&#xD;
object of constant terror. Unfit for any rc gular&#xD;
occupation, no hour of the day was secure from his&#xD;
intrusion, and, as if to vex his wife to the utmost, he&#xD;
sought every means to annoy and abuse Amelia.&#xD;
The first time she ever manifested any enthusiasm&#xD;
was when accompanying her mother~ to Mr. Clare-&#xD;
mont's, she heard the sound of music, and looked up&#xD;
with a pleased expression, saying, "Oh mother, what&#xD;
is that ? " He being present, persuaded her to go&#xD;
into the parlor where his wilje was playing on the&#xD;
piano. She even permitted him to take her into his&#xD;
lap, sitting like one entranced until the music ceased,&#xD;
when she resumed her former listless expression,&#xD;
and slid down immediately to her mother's sidQ.&#xD;
This little incident awakened quite an interest in&#xD;

CONNECTICUT.&#xD;
&#xD;
45&#xD;
&#xD;
her, and gave rise to various trifling attentions which&#xD;
overcame in a great measure her timidity towards&#xD;
them all, except Rosalind, whom she regarded as a&#xD;
kind of sup-crier being.&#xD;
She was indeed quite a curiosity to that scrutiniz-&#xD;
ing little personage, which Amelia had tact enough&#xD;
to perceive, knowing very well she was not what she&#xD;
* ought to be, and was therefore exceedingly shy of&#xD;
her. Once, being sent there of an errand, she saw a&#xD;
large Newfoundland dog eating from the same dish&#xD;
with a cat, the result of Rosalind's untiring efforts&#xD;
* to make them friends from the moment her father&#xD;
introduced the noble looking animal who received no&#xD;
smaff share of her attention, as she tested him in&#xD;

her wonderful achievement~ when she saw them sleep-&#xD;
ing quietly side by side and eating together in the&#xD;
greatest harmony.&#xD;
Amelia was not accustomed to such scenes of&#xD;
peaceable companionship, which excited her wonder&#xD;
in the highest degree. Seeing Mr. Claremont stand-&#xD;
ing in the dpor, she ran towards him with unusual&#xD;
animation, saying, "There's a dog and a cat eatin'&#xD;
out of the same scoop, I seed~'em with my own eyes,&#xD;
ii did." This quaint exclamation excited the mirth~&#xD;
fulness of Rosahind, who was within hearing and&#xD;
burst into a loud laugh.&#xD;
The timid child shrunk into her herself again, and&#xD;
nothing could induce her to speak another word&#xD;
until she was gone.&#xD;

erty. She might have provided well for herself and&#xD;
child had they been alone, by her own industry.; but&#xD;
words are needless to explain here what is so well&#xD;
known to every drunkard's family.&#xD;
At times the miserable man experienced all the&#xD;
horrors of a drunkard's remorse; when hcr feelings&#xD;
of mingled pity ~nd affection banished every other&#xD;
thought. His career was fast drawing to a close, and&#xD;
ended in delirium tremens when Amelia was twelve&#xD;
years old. One of the horrid phantoms of his dis-&#xD;
eased imagination was that of his little boy whosO&#xD;
death he had caused, chasing him with a club, and&#xD;
cursing him with the most fearful oaths. In a com-&#xD;
paratively, lucid interval, a by-stander, thinking to&#xD;
comfort him said, " Your son is an angel now, inter-&#xD;
ceding for you in the name of a holy Savior's love,"&#xD;
but he was quickly interrupted by the raving maniac,&#xD;
who, starting up with glaring eyeballs and convub&#xD;
sive gestures, exclaimed at the top of his voice,&#xD;
"hush all your deceitful wiles about a Savior and&#xD;
his love and angels, I tell you there's no such thing,&#xD;
nothing but the seven hells of the bottomless pit&#xD;
where we shall all go," followed by such curses and&#xD;
imprecations as would congeal the stoniest heart.&#xD;
This death-bed scene haunted Amelia for years&#xD;
after, in dreams and in her waking hours, giving her&#xD;
passive nature its first quickening impulse and an&#xD;
unfavorable one too. Its effect on her mother was&#xD;
still more disastrous. The reaction consequent on&#xD;
being so suddenly relieved from all fear and anxiety,&#xD;
and the time now left for reflection, soon produced a&#xD;
melancholy state of mind.&#xD;
&#xD;
Memory was plying her ~busy fingers among the&#xD;
withered leaves of what was once the gay and glori-&#xD;
oiis blossoming of youth, and retrospection *sternly&#xD;
casting accounts of the blighted joys, bleeding affec~&#xD;
tion~ and blasted hopes of a life that had promised&#xD;
at its opening to be as bright and beautiful as Mrs.&#xD;
Claremont's. How vividly rose to mind the bright&#xD;
anticipations with which she had stepped from the&#xD;
threshold of a dear and luxurious home, to share the&#xD;
destiny of one whom she reverenced as the embodi-&#xD;
ment of all that is great and noble, and what a destiny&#xD;
it had been ! Then how quickly faded the memory&#xD;
of his faults and vices before that overpoxvei:ing love&#xD;
which sought to palliate them through the med nation&#xD;
of siirroundiiig influences or some short-coming of&#xD;
its own, and which magnified his virtues in the same&#xD;
proportion.&#xD;
it is no blind idolatry that makes the virtues of&#xD;
departed ones so far outweigh their faults to surviv-&#xD;
ing friends, but a prophetic intuition soaring to&#xD;
the higher life the spirit attains as it ascends&#xD;
from the ills flesh is heir to, which beholds it&#xD;
trausflgured into the divine symmetry designed by&#xD;
its orEfinal Architect, and which is the birth-right of&#xD;
immortality.&#xD;
It is hard to conquer human nature. How fondly&#xD;
we cling to the perishing clay even when wasted by&#xD;
disease, and the mental faculties are impaired by suf-&#xD;
fering,, with a strength of affection unknown before.&#xD;
It is the conflict of flesh with spirit, of mortality&#xD;
with immortality-a crisis of love.&#xD;

natural unfolding of his oww character.&#xD;
Her sense of justice was very keen, arriving at&#xD;
results more through the intellect, than' the moral&#xD;
perceptions. The ~reverse was true of Walter, whose&#xD;
reception of a truth preceded the argument. lie&#xD;
desired proof to test his decision, not to help him&#xD;
form it; while she must trace all its logical results&#xD;
before accepting it as positive. Their influence over&#xD;

to him with reverence for the readiness with which&#xD;
* he complied with the wishes of his parents, while she&#xD;
was considering every possible motive that could in~&#xD;
duce them to desire any thing contrary to her own&#xD;
inclinations, not doub~r~ng its propriety more than he,&#xD;
but it was a necessity of her nature to understand&#xD;
the reason. She commanded his admiration for the&#xD;
noble qualities displayed in conneetlon with her&#xD;
faults, and, in her sudden ebullitions of temper, lie&#xD;
liked to trace those heroic elements through which&#xD;
she rose sublimely to a conquest 6ver self never&#xD;
deenilng it any virtue in himself to do what cost him&#xD;
ito effort. It was a most fortunate thing for her to&#xD;
be blessed with parents who had the time and ability&#xD;
to study her peculiar traits before attempting to&#xD;
control her. Conscious Qf her faults, more depended&#xD;
&#xD;
on their patience in her own process of 9orrecting&#xD;

~    The autumn had beeii unusually mild, the woods&#xD;

~mei~ ones, more lavish than others of their blossoming&#xD;
season, were in full bloom until late in the month of&#xD;
October crc he touched them with a breath of his&#xD;
regal power.&#xD;
To Rosalind's enthusiastic soul it was a season of&#xD;
intense enjoyment. Many were her rambles in the&#xD;
~ groves, those majestic temples of nature, where the&#xD;
lingering breath of summer wooed heir to gentler&#xD;
melodies in fanning the fevered heat, that at times&#xD;
burst forth in youthful impetuosity from her ardent&#xD;
thirst for knowledge, which was now beginning to be&#xD;
slaked at its fountains.&#xD;
Her father often accompanied her, watching with&#xD;
pleasure the indications that the impatient restless-&#xD;
ness of her childhood was subsiding into the health-&#xD;
ful activity of youths A more tranquil, contented&#xD;
expression cast its radiance over her features which&#xD;
he hoped would, in~ time, entirely chase away the&#xD;
look of perplexity that cast its shadow over so much of&#xD;
her early years~ The last walk they enjoyed togeLhe~,&#xD;
at Rosalind's s~~ggestio~, they held a family pic-nic in&#xD;

A TALE OP THE&#xD;
&#xD;
The air was as balmy as a day in June, and a gay&#xD;
time Walter an~ the squirrels had, of whom he&#xD;
w~s particularly fond, a fact which they seemed 'to&#xD;
divine. The birds were Th.salind's greater favorites&#xD;
who~ chirped abo4t her as if to impart the joy they&#xD;
felt for this genial1 breath of summer air.&#xD;
Mrs. Claremont lived over again the days of her&#xD;
girlhood, comparing their measure of happiness with&#xD;
that of mature years, and arrived at the sage con-&#xD;
clusion that the prevalent idea of the greatest amount&#xD;
of happiness being possible to young people, because&#xD;
free from care, was as erroneous as it would be to&#xD;
call the learner of the alphabet more enviable than&#xD;
the matliematiciaii, or the astronomer, as the demand&#xD;
is less on the intellectual powers. She did not fail&#xD;
to comprehen~, however, how much truth there is in&#xD;
this idea, for the majority of the world, whose over-&#xD;
'whelming cares oppress their faculties to such a de-&#xD;
gree, that their minds have no opportunity to expand.&#xD;
"Philosophizing yet," observed Mr. Claremont, a~&#xD;
he and the children surprised her on a little mound&#xD;
where she was sitting, apparently lost in contempla-&#xD;
tion, her eyes fixed on the blue expanse of water in&#xD;
the distance.&#xD;
"Was it thus you philosophized in the days of*&#xD;
'auld lang syne,' ~' said Walter with a mischievous&#xD;
twinkle in his eyes, " when father did a wooing go?"&#xD;
"Imp udenee beyond measure," retorted Rosalind,&#xD;
kicking along the chestnut burrs at her feet, "when&#xD;
the frost comes in good earnest, we'll have another&#xD;
stroll here after the chestnuts. I wa~ going to say&#xD;
this has been the happiest day of my life, but had&#xD;

sons."&#xD;
"And you ought to have an extra one for this act&#xD;
of self-denial, for I came very near saying it myself,"&#xD;
said he as he pulled her down into a hillock of dry&#xD;
leaves, covering her with kisses, and then held her&#xD;
by main strength until he had covered he~ with the&#xD;
leaves.&#xD;
"Do look there," lie suddenly shouted, permitting~&#xD;
her to raise her head, "I verily believe the senior&#xD;
couple imagine themselves young lovers again. See&#xD;
how cozily they are walking along, arm in arm, as if&#xD;
they composed the whole of the world, and nobody&#xD;
else was worth thinking of. I mean to just remind&#xD;
'em there are two others," starting to run after them,&#xD;
when she pulled him back, and kept hold of him&#xD;
until they reached the house.&#xD;
"II like to see them," said she, "and you need not&#xD;
be so jealous of a little cozy talk they are having.&#xD;
Perhaps they are considering how hey shall train us&#xD;
in the way we should go," and bot ~ giving a bound,&#xD;
each ran a race to see who woul reach the house&#xD;
first.&#xD;
Before entering, she called his attention to a little&#xD;
root of candy tuft near the house, hich had escaped&#xD;
the frost, as she supposed, from i s sheltered situa;&#xD;

face, and stopped abruptly.&#xD;

"Well, candy tuft shall ecide for us," said he,&#xD;
rising to go into the house.&#xD;
&#xD;
defied the frost. I had a curiosity to know what&#xD;
kind of a judge of the weather a person would make&#xD;
who couldn't tell a plant from a weed. I am going&#xD;
to hand your name to the society on natural science&#xD;
for a diploma as an eminent naturalist."&#xD;

hands, "just because I happened to pull up the rest&#xD;
of it, thinking it was a weed which it exactly re~&#xD;
senibles."&#xD;
"As much as a lemon does an orange," said he&#xD;
with as much distinctness as she would let him. "I&#xD;

"Well, I don't care if you have covered it up, it&#xD;

Here it is the middle of November, and a plant in&#xD;

"I knew tl~at would spoil it for you, you are such&#xD;

"There's no knowing but it might have been just&#xD;
so if you had not covered it."&#xD;

The silver links that lengthen,&#xD;
Joy's visits when most brief'&#xD;
Drear and lone upon the window pane sounded&#xD;
the ceaseless patter of the rain, as twc little naked&#xD;
feet shivered on the door step, and two sad, but&#xD;
piercing eyes, peered through the casement into the&#xD;
cheerfully lighted drawing room, ere the puny hand&#xD;
ventured to raise the knocker that would admit the&#xD;
little mendicant into the rich mm's mansion. Scarcely&#xD;
had she produced a sound when the dog set up a&#xD;
loud bark, which frightened the little homeless wan-&#xD;
derer into the desolate street again, until the watch-&#xD;
man should provide a scarcely more inviting shelter.&#xD;
"What is the matter with Ponto? " said Walter,&#xD;

"I thought I saw a glimpse of somebody as I passed&#xD;
the window just then, but it x~as s6 faint, if there&#xD;
was any one, I could not tell whether it was man,&#xD;
woman or child," answered Rosalind, and resumed&#xD;
her reading.&#xD;
~Phere's no one at the door, Milly?" inquired&#xD;
Mrs. Claremont, as she entered.&#xD;
(~%3)&#xD;
&#xD;
"No," replied she, "us IL was passing through the&#xD;
hail I heard something that sounded like an attempt&#xD;
to raise the knocker, but there was no one to be&#xD;
seen."&#xD;
"Perhaps it was the wind."&#xD;
"It must be a very trickish wind to set the dog&#xD;
barking, raise knockers and make you see a~pari-&#xD;
tions, Rosa."&#xD;
"I hope nobody is cast away in such a storm as&#xD;
this, Jam sure."&#xD;
"You are so absorbed in your book you fancy&#xD;
yourself on Crusoe's desolate island I really believe,&#xD;
'talking as if any body could be cast away on land.&#xD;

favor us with some of your sage reflections, won't&#xD;

"Well, I have read it tl~rough at last, and there is&#xD;
a striking resemblance between it and Pilgrim's Pro-&#xD;
gress," said Rosalind, after a few moments of silence,&#xD;
as she pushed from her an elegantly bound volume&#xD;
of Robinson Crusoe, with such force as to startle&#xD;
from her slumbers the old gray cat who had been&#xD;
permitted to take her evening nap upon the table.&#xD;
"Is that all," said Walter, holding up his hands&#xD;
with a comical gesture, "I thought some very impor-&#xD;
tant announcement was coming from the flourish&#xD;
you made, something that might possibly affect the&#xD;
moon's setting or the sun's rising."&#xD;

for the most interesting novel that can be written&#xD;
without mentioning that ~subject. I believe it would&#xD;

steal them out from under their other books and pre-&#xD;

"That is the way you pass judgment is it, assume&#xD;

"Is there any prize offered to the one who gets the&#xD;

"No. Mr. Spindlebotham,-that is such a funny&#xD;
name I always want to laugh when I speak it,~-told us&#xD;
to see who could do it alone, and Ton'i had so much&#xD;
to say about it that three of us resolved to try our&#xD;
best, as much for a joke en him as anything, he&#xD;
amuses us so with his airs. One morning,, being late&#xD;
at school, he wanted to be very polite~ so he touched&#xD;
lri~ hand to his forehead and said, 'Good morning&#xD;

After watching him for a few moments in silence,&#xD;
until he appeared about as much puzzled as he rep-&#xD;

her closely around his neck, to which pussy responded&#xD;
by a faint mew.&#xD;

do you call that where all sides cannot be right and&#xD;
yet none of them wrong?"&#xD;
"I give it to you as a mathematical problem to&#xD;
solve after you have finished your equation."&#xD;
"Don't talk any more, for I am very busy,-..~3x&#xD;
plus 4y-."&#xD;
"Equals the summit of all eai'thly ambition, and&#xD;
&#xD;
makes one so abstracted that he fancies some one&#xD;
else is talking when he is hearing himself think.&#xD;
Just as you and I get engaged, father, he will take&#xD;
up the conversation and then scold me for it."&#xD;
"Well Rosa, what was the idea you intended ~to&#xD;
bring out?" said her father.&#xD;
"That if there is a certain standard all men must&#xD;
recognize and live up to in order to be happy, how&#xD;
are we going to know what it is when opinions differ&#xD;
so much? One person says this is the only true faith&#xD;
and another says that."&#xD;
"I think you ar6 laboring under a inis~pprehen-&#xD;
sion of t~rms. You confound theology with intui-&#xD;
tion. One is spiritual, the other intellectual."&#xD;
"Theology, how I hate that word! I never could&#xD;
understand it, and what it has to do with a person's&#xD;
life in making him good or bad. Why should we&#xD;
- assume to be nearer right than others?"&#xD;
"That assumption of right is based on a correct&#xD;
principle. In order to start an opinion or truth we&#xD;
must assume its infallibility until convinced of its&#xD;
error. We must have a stand pohit whence to draw&#xD;
our conclusions, which will be truth to us so long as&#xD;
we conscientiously believe it. The error lies in ex-&#xD;
cluding others from the privilege of exercising the&#xD;
same prerogative, whose opinions are entitled to the&#xD;
same respect as ours. By tolerating and discussing&#xD;
each other~ s views the errors are detected, over which&#xD;
the truth, from its divine character, must ultimately&#xD;
prevail.&#xD;

62              4. TALE OF THE&#xD;
The Bible bein~ an exposition of' tr~th as it has been&#xD;
revealed to different nations in d ~fferent ages, and&#xD;
receiving its coloring from all varieties of tempera~&#xD;
ment, may be brought to the support of every shade&#xD;
of opinion and every form of belief. But the mo-&#xD;
ment any sect sets up its claim to infallibility and&#xD;
shuns investigation, it begins its career as a spiritual&#xD;
despotism.&#xD;
The religious element is inherent and will find&#xD;
expression in some form. It gives rise to church&#xD;
organizations which, though an imperfect expression&#xD;
of what the soul would asph'e to, are in their origin&#xD;
the outward symbol' of a truth yet but dimly revealed&#xD;
to the inner consciousness, destined to become clearer&#xD;
and more spiritual in its conceptions, so long as free-&#xD;
dom of thought counteracts the natural tendency of&#xD;
organizations to supplant the living spirit by the dead&#xD;
letter. The great error of the religious world is, its&#xD;
proneness to substitute the infallibility of belief for&#xD;
the immutability of faith, and hence the conflict ever&#xD;
going on between faith and conscience on the one&#xD;
side, and belief and temporary expediency on the&#xD;
other, ~which makes every age a protest against the&#xD;
religious creed of the preceding one. As there is&#xD;
but one God there can be but one manifestation of&#xD;
his spirit. It is the same trust in him, the same&#xD;
hatred of wrong and oppression, that has inspired the&#xD;
prophets and apostles, the martyrs and reformers of&#xD;
all ages, whether believers in the Jewish rituals, the&#xD;
stern tenets of Calvinism, or the mild and beneficent&#xD;
sway of that eternal and unchanging Love by which&#xD;
the ever n~eroiful Father. overrules the sins of all his&#xD;
&#xD;
CONNECTICUT.&#xD;
&#xD;
63&#xD;
&#xD;
erring children, that he may draw them unto him~elf.&#xD;
He has implanted in every human soul a divine in~&#xD;
stint which the Quakers call 'the inner light,' which,&#xD;
if properly heeded, will guide us safely through the.&#xD;
world, its temptations and perplexities. Through it&#xD;
we may learn to appropriate the pure and good, and&#xD;
as certainly reject the wrong. It also reveals the&#xD;
hidden mysteries and sublime inspiration contained&#xD;
in the Bible, which would otherwise be a sealed book,&#xD;
and confirm us in superstition, rather than lead us&#xD;
to the light."&#xD;
"It seems to me there are some very sensible&#xD;
things about the Quakers. If they didn't condemn&#xD;
music, and require their members to be so odd in&#xD;
some things, I should like to join theme"&#xD;
"I should have supposed that would be the very&#xD;
reason why you would like to join them. I think&#xD;
you take pains to be different from others," inter-&#xD;
rupted Walter.&#xD;
"Have you finished your equation? I should ad~&#xD;
vise you to attend to that. I don't try to pattern&#xD;
after others. It would be the height of stupidity to&#xD;
do or believe a thing because somebody else did. No,&#xD;
I choose to have an opinion of my own, and it would&#xD;
suit me all the better not to agree exactly with any~&#xD;
body. That shows independence which is a very&#xD;
desirable quality, and one to be commended even if&#xD;
it does sometimes lead to eccentricity."&#xD;
"So on that principle ~you anticipate a compliment&#xD;
for yourself, instead of waiting, as the custom is, for&#xD;
others to bestow it, themselves being judges. It is a&#xD;
trait of independence in the Qi~akers to be so odd in&#xD;

&#xD;
some things, wh~ch you have been censuring in them.&#xD;
Not very consist~ nt art thou."&#xD;
"I don't puz Ac my head over consistencies. I&#xD;
want to follow the bent of' my own mind. What&#xD;
looks consistent to one may not to another. They&#xD;
believe in following where the spirit moves, and that's&#xD;
what I like. This feeling obliged to do something,&#xD;
because it is right, I don't believe in. If it is right,&#xD;
we must feel a desire to do it to be a virtue."&#xD;
"I fear, Rosalind," said her father, "you would not&#xD;
be so willing as you think. What they mean by that~&#xD;
is not original with them, neither is it confined to&#xD;
them. The dictates of conscience are to be obeyed,&#xD;
let them lead us where they will, as they often do,&#xD;
contrary to our inclinations. That would be hard&#xD;
for you. The cross must come before the crown.&#xD;
Freedom of conscience, which forms the basis of&#xD;
every religious organization at its birth, means the&#xD;
freedom to act according to our convictions of duty,&#xD;
however they may conflict with our own will, or the&#xD;
judgment of others, yet so imperative that only in&#xD;
yielding obedience to them can we obtain the peace&#xD;
of mind essential to happiness.&#xD;
The higher our faculties, the greater the evil re-&#xD;
sulting from a perversion of them. hence it is that&#xD;
religious despotism is more cruel aiA intolerable&#xD;
than any other, rind the reaction in the effort to over-&#xD;
throw it often results in the other extreme, and re-&#xD;
pudiates much that is good. The Puritan and the&#xD;
Quaker were the legitimate children of a profligate&#xD;
ministry,' and a general corruption of church and&#xD;
~tate, who, instead of following in the wickedness of&#xD;
&#xD;
their fathers, rose up to protest against it in tho&#xD;
name of the religion they professed; and the perse-&#xD;
cutions inflicted on them for daring to attack the&#xD;
corruption, naturally led them to a bolder renuncia-&#xD;
tion of the forms and creeds so tenaciously cherished,&#xD;
and a more rigid adherence to their own convictions.&#xD;
Thus began a superstitious reverence' for opinions,&#xD;
often trivial in themselves, and an undue importance&#xD;
attached to questions whose only merit consisted in&#xD;
the defence of the great principle of freedom of&#xD;
thought and expression~. Because amusements had&#xD;
not been kept within rational bounds, they were&#xD;
wholly banished, and the divine gift of music con-&#xD;
demned."&#xD;
"I think it is wicked to condemn anything so re-&#xD;
fining and elevating in its influence as music, and&#xD;
for no other reason than that it is pleasing to the&#xD;
ear. I would go without the crown before I would&#xD;
take up such a cross. It is no more rational than to&#xD;
mortify the flesh as the Catholics do. I had a good&#xD;
deal of sympathy with that Popish priest in Robinson&#xD;
'Crusoe. Seems to me lie was about the right sort of&#xD;
a man, and Crusoe himself passed through similar&#xD;
experiences to John Bunyan."&#xD;
"Just as I said," again interrupted Walter, "you&#xD;
can accede to any thing, or draw a comparison or&#xD;
contrast that would never enter another person's&#xD;
head. I guess you'd find some of th~ graver sort&#xD;
would shake their heads at you for daring to place&#xD;
l~obinson Crusoe on the same footing with Pilgrim's&#xD;

66              A TALE OF THE&#xD;
&#xD;
shocked the other day because I said, when speaking&#xD;
of the two books, that, as a work of fiction, Pilgrim's&#xD;
Progress greatly excelled. She started and ex-&#xD;
claimed, 'You don't call that a novel do you?' I&#xD;
laughed, and said, 'Why, what is there so dreadful&#xD;
about that to make you look so frightened? I never&#xD;
thought of calling it a novel, but, coi~e to think of&#xD;
it, why isn't it a religious novel. It is cei~ta.inly a&#xD;
work of fiction, 'and so far as an approach to facts is&#xD;
concerned, there is much more of plausibility in the&#xD;
shipwreck of, Crusoe on a desolate island, than in the&#xD;
hobgoblin adventures of Christian.'' She has been&#xD;
shy of me ever since. What say you father '?"&#xD;
"In the common acceptation of the term, Pu-&#xD;
gi~im's Progress would hardly be called a iiovel,&#xD;
although literally it may be proper ~iiough. It is&#xD;
rather a delineation of time spiritual pilgrimage, and&#xD;
as a work of genius, stands unrivalled, not merely&#xD;
for its combination of talent, but also for its adapta-&#xD;
tion to all ranks and every condition in life, exclus~ivc&#xD;
of no sect or creed."&#xD;
"So you think father, thai it should not be classed&#xD;
with Robinson Crusoe."&#xD;
"I do not think it will suffer from contamination.&#xD;
I was not comparing, the merits of the two, only&#xD;
speaking of their different characters. The other,&#xD;
you knew, is not strictly spiritual, but comprises also&#xD;
physical enjoyments and ~privations, representing out-&#xD;
ward and material life with the inner, whereas the&#xD;
first represents only the inner."&#xD;
"So much the more sensible then, for we cannot&#xD;
separate the inner from the outward life on this&#xD;

planet. There is more of the foundation.of facts in.&#xD;
Crusoe, just ~s I said, and therefore as a work of&#xD;
fiction, John Bunyan's work is the most romantic."&#xD;
"Stick to it Rosa, like a. hero, perched up there&#xD;
like a queen on a throne. I've just thought of a&#xD;
good sketch of yourself as the heroine of a story.&#xD;
Imagine yourself so original and independent, you&#xD;
long for some sequestered spot where you will be&#xD;
subject to no control, and therefore set sail for some&#xD;
lonely island in the, Pacific, where you can reign.&#xD;
with such undisputed sway that no human being&#xD;
darc approach you."&#xD;
"Why Walter, I would like to know whether you&#xD;
meant that all as a joke or half in earnest. You do&#xD;
not really mistake me so much as to suppose I spurn&#xD;
all control? It is one of the hiappi~st sensations of&#xD;
my life to be controlled as I often am by you, and if&#xD;
you did n6t know it then here is my confession."&#xD;
"I think Walter understands you Rosa, but I am&#xD;
glad to see you come out with so much frankness and&#xD;
arrest even the least suspicion of a misunderstanding.&#xD;
I. hope you will act on that principle through life,&#xD;
and not allow yourself to harbor in secret an unkind&#xD;

plained away, or shown to be without a cause. How.&#xD;

of' the matter, and confronting it in its first stage&#xD;
without any exaggeration."&#xD;
"The theatre is a good place to illustrate this, and&#xD;
now we will discuss that subject. What a quiet time&#xD;
we are hating. It seems all the pleasanter for the&#xD;
storm outside. Mother, why don't you speak?&#xD;
"You had better give her a chance. She could&#xD;
not get a word in edgewise," said Walter.&#xD;
"It's you that fill up the chinks. After telling me&#xD;
repeatedly that you did not wish to b.c interrupted,&#xD;
you have improved every opportunity f6 slide in&#xD;
some thing, and now do not even allow mother the&#xD;

"It seems to me my children delight in running&#xD;

"Oh nicely. I shall get it one df thes days, that&#xD;

"Walter! I wish father would send you from the&#xD;

"I fear if I did, my daughter would be interceding&#xD;

what speculations have you been making upon that?"&#xD;
"Priscilla Greenwood's mother says it is a very&#xD;
wicked place, and she would not allow a child of hers&#xD;
to go there upon any consideration. I know you&#xD;
never appeared very anxious for us to go, yet you&#xD;
have taken us there sometimes, and I have enjoyed&#xD;
it. llavn't you Walter?"&#xD;
"I don't like it. Nothing but love, love, love from&#xD;
the beginning to the end of the chapter. Dying for&#xD;
&#xD;
love, hating for love, and last of all killing some-&#xD;
body for love."&#xD;

ences resulting from it is the low, sensual character&#xD;
in which it presents the holiest emotion of this mor-&#xD;

"I know it. We do homage to talent wherever&#xD;
we find it. I suppose it is all we can expect of a&#xD;
theatre since it professes to be oniy a place of amuse-&#xD;
ment, totally indifferent to the moral or immoral&#xD;
influences engendered, farther than to ensure a suc-&#xD;
cessful patronage from the comnmnity~ I was&#xD;
thinking of the good it might exert, calling into ex-&#xD;
ercise our highest and noblest feelings by arraying&#xD;
in equally attractive colors the triumphs of virtue&#xD;
over vice, instead of displaying so much that is bloody&#xD;
and revengeful, to kindle the passions. Love of the&#xD;
dramatic is implanted within us which it is lawful to&#xD;
gratify within certain limits. I do not think it dis-&#xD;
plays a highly cultivated and refined mind to be a&#xD;
habitual visitor at the theatre, for the reasons I have&#xD;
stated, yet if well disciplined will generally be proof&#xD;
against its debasing effects, from the fact that it can&#xD;
have no affinity with the lower passions. But before&#xD;
the c1iara~cter is formed there may be great danger&#xD;
of vitiating the moral sense with such an indiscriini-&#xD;
nate mixture of virtue and vice, therefore I have.&#xD;
been very guarded in taking you there. I did not&#xD;
think it best to exclude you from it ei4irely as the&#xD;
time must come when you will have to flux with the&#xD;
world, discover its baseness and hypocrisy, and also&#xD;
be surprised with much that is noble and honorable&#xD;
where you least expect to find it."&#xD;
"You think then that we may learh something of&#xD;
real life there don't you?"&#xD;
"Oh yes, as we do in novels. A proper discrimi-&#xD;
nation is to be made. The sickly, sentimental trash&#xD;
that has so disgusted Walter should be universally&#xD;

condemned for the benefit of the human race as he&#xD;
said, but there are those truly exalting and benefit&#xD;
cent in their influence, whence we may derive a&#xD;
more thorough knoxvledge of. human nature, than&#xD;
from any other source."&#xD;
"I think it would be a great advantage to Mrs.&#xD;
Greenwood to read something in that line besides&#xD;
Pilgrim's Progress. She has the most narrow, con-&#xD;
tracted mind of any body I ever knew, and thinks&#xD;
there can be 110 good people but those who believe&#xD;
as she does. She will not allow Priscilla to leave&#xD;
her apron strings except to go to school, and then&#xD;
gives her strict orders how to beh~ve, forbidding her&#xD;
to join the oth~r girls in any of their sports. If she&#xD;
happens to 1aug11 out loud at home her mother is as&#xD;
cross and crabbed as a sea owl. I should be perfectly&#xD;
miserable to live so. I couldn't. She wouldn't&#xD;

"That's what she wouldn't; yo~~ spoke the truth&#xD;

by your own knowledge, too."&#xD;
"How happens it that you and she have contracted&#xD;
so nuich of an intimacy when there is no resemblance&#xD;
between you, and you do not like her mother well&#xD;
enough to enjoy going there very much."&#xD;
"Of course that's reason enough for her to like&#xD;
her," said Walter.&#xD;

about, and though we do not agree, I enjoy drawing&#xD;

with my arguments. I think she has a superior&#xD;
mind, but it has always been cramped up in a nut&#xD;
shell. Her mother would riot like to have her asso-&#xD;
ciate with me if it were not for our grave conversa-&#xD;
tion. She has no fear of my influence over her, and&#xD;
indulges great hopes that her's over me may be an&#xD;
instrument for my salvation, for with all her cross-&#xD;
ness she thinks the world of Priscilla, and well she&#xD;
may.&#xD;
"My dear daughter, I am afraid you judge Mrs.&#xD;
Greenwood too harshly. Nature has not endowed&#xD;
her with the soft, musical voice of your motlier, or&#xD;
that genial temperament which carries smiles and&#xD;
content wherever it goes. Besides, her plans for life&#xD;
were thwarted in her youth, and she seems to have&#xD;
borne the cross ever since without anticipating a&#xD;
crowii, and seems conscientiously bent in training&#xD;
her daughter just so."&#xD;
"Did you know her when she was young?"&#xD;
"Oh yes. She was one of the gayest girls that&#xD;
ever tripped the floor at the fashionable balls in the&#xD;
city, though without her parents' knowledge. They&#xD;
lived in the country a few miles distant, and were&#xD;
strict Calvinists. A young man of respectable con-&#xD;
nexions, and for ought I know, of respectable char-&#xD;
acter, sought and secured her love. The bitter&#xD;
opposition of her parents, on account of his different&#xD;
religious vkws, wrought so upon her fears and con-&#xD;
scientiousness, that she broke the engagement, and&#xD;
soon after joining tho church, became a scrupulous&#xD;
observer of its rituals; but it was evident to all who&#xD;
had previously known her, that it was not a within~&#xD;
&#xD;
CONNECTICUT.&#xD;
&#xD;
sacrifice. She grew morose and reserved, care fully&#xD;
avoiding all her former associates."&#xD;
"I never could see how Mr. Greenwood could&#xD;
fancy her, he is such a contrast. I know his religious&#xD;
views are as rigid as hers, but he is always so pleasant&#xD;
and agreeable, and so handsome too, any one could&#xD;
not help liking him."&#xD;
"IJandsome, Rosa! if that isn't the weakest speech&#xD;
I ever heard you make, as if beauty would make us&#xD;
love a person any better,~' observed Walter.&#xD;
"How you do take me up in every thing I say.&#xD;
Affection is not founded on beauty, but you cannot&#xD;
deny that beauty is attractive and very properly so,&#xD;
but the want of it never weakens our attachment nor&#xD;
prevents us from loving as much. I think mother is&#xD;
handsomer than you, father, but I must say lE love&#xD;
you a little the most. You will not be jealous, will&#xD;
you mother?"&#xD;
~' No, my darling, I shall never be jealous of the&#xD;
love your father wins.&#xD;
"Crackee! I didn't think beauty was coming un-&#xD;
der discussion. Mother, don't you care! I believe I&#xD;
love you a little the most, not because you are the&#xD;
handsomest, but because you are my mother-a good&#xD;
reason. But Rosa is so different from other folks;&#xD;
and somehow-don't you think I care any thing about&#xD;
it, father ,-it always seems to me as if you love Rosa&#xD;
a little bit more."&#xD;

trials that may beset her future pathway ; ~but still I&#xD;
know that it will not be without suffering and con-&#xD;
flict she will attain to that peaceful submission, -which&#xD;
in you, Walter, is a state of quiet content iilseparable&#xD;
from your uniform, happy nature.&#xD;
Sympathy with suffering often creates an attach-&#xD;
F ment that would otherwise never exist, and one&#xD;
already existing strengthens, if possible, which is not&#xD;
inconsistent with the law of natural affection; for&#xD;
those who are strong in themselves being less de-&#xD;
pendent on others for support or enjoyment, can bet-&#xD;
ter dispense pith it. But what ax~i I saying? My&#xD;
head feels a little confused to-night. I do not mean&#xD;
that Rosa is not strong, or that you are not equally&#xD;
dear to me. I mean that she has imposed upon me&#xD;
the greatest responsibility, and consequently, has&#xD;
engrossed more of my thoughts. If called upon to&#xD;
choose which of you I would most willingly surren-&#xD;
der, I fear that it would be a trial like that of the&#xD;
woman whom Solomon judged, 'and I should cry out,&#xD;
both, if need be, but spare me from choosing."&#xD;
And a voice whispered, "Thou shalt be spared thd&#xD;
r.    trial.''&#xD;
For a few moments there w~s a deep silence.&#xD;
Mournfully the wind 'swayed the old oak which but a&#xD;
few weeks before had swept the window with its leafy&#xD;

and desolate appearance, of the alternate joys and&#xD;

been permitted to invade the luxuriant growth which&#xD;
often interfered with their own convenience.&#xD;
At length Walter left his father's embrace and&#xD;
i~esumed his task, but not until he had reminded&#xD;
Rosa of the burden she might possibly be if she kept&#xD;
her present position much longer. "I am afraid&#xD;
father is tired," said he, in a low voice.&#xD;
"Oh I never thought of being heavy, I will get&#xD;
down a few minutes, but shall come back again, for&#xD;
I want you to sing to me yet father, as you did when&#xD;
I was a little girl, and mother must play on the&#xD;
piano.&#xD;
"No, no, sit still, you are not very heavy."&#xD;
"Then I will get a cricket whiqh will make me a&#xD;
little lighter."&#xD;
"Sit still Rosa, I'll get you. a cricket; it seems to&#xD;
me you are calculating on a pretty long evening. It&#xD;
is already nine o'clock?'&#xD;
"We have talked enough for the present, only&#xD;

Perhaps a faint radiance from the opening glories&#xD;

illumined his conceptions at that mo~menL With a&#xD;

and sense negative the other answer, which would&#xD;
not have failed to bring on questions he might be&#xD;

"Now we will drop our discussion for tonight and&#xD;

occasionally. There is such a pleasant contrast be-&#xD;

what has become of her'?"&#xD;
"Then you think there was a beggar at the door?&#xD;
&#xD;
If I had had the least suspicion of it I should have&#xD;
gone out in search of her," said her father.&#xD;
"I did not think much of it then, as Milly said&#xD;
she went to the door, but Ponto never barks at&#xD;
nothing, and perhaps he frightened her away. The&#xD;
more I think of it, the more confident I am of a&#xD;
glimpse of some sort of a bonnet. Oh Ponto! you&#xD;
must learn better manners. That was not civil.&#xD;
You should frighten only rogues away. There, see&#xD;
how penitent he is, he seems to say, 'Forgive me this&#xD;

JIalloa, pussy cat, doii't rub it out, stretching your&#xD;
bug paws out here, and opening your mouth as if&#xD;
you wanted to swallow all the knowledge you can get&#xD;
without working for it. Father, did you ever see&#xD;
such a funny cat? She will sit straight up and go&#xD;
to sleep, and nod just like folks; and if we speak to&#xD;
her shell open her eyes just a little bit and then&#xD;
nod as if assenting to what we say."&#xD;
"She's a wonderful cat, no doubt~ and one of h~r&#xD;
most wonderful feats is, as you will think, that she&#xD;
kuows your step. She will start out of a sound&#xD;
sleep when s!ie hears it and look for you as e~gerIy&#xD;

"I've noticed that she's always up and wide awake&#xD;

Yes, that is right. How smart you will feel now.&#xD;
Sit down on the cricket and lay your head in my&#xD;
lap. Father is going to sing to us, and presently&#xD;
we'll join in concert."&#xD;
"No indeed, Rosa, I don't come down to that yet,&#xD;

The rich; musical tones of Mrs. Claremont's voice,&#xD;
the rapturous ~low of her countenance, the graceful&#xD;

of those celestial harmonies, whose inspiring anthems&#xD;
speak to the lowly sons of earth to r~ise4them heaven&#xD;

to them from a voluptuary.&#xD;
Surely we may pardon much to the superstition of&#xD;
that sect which, . recognizing the divine character of&#xD;
music, in their argument that only those whose devo-&#xD;

CHAPTER VIL&#xD;
"There is no death, 'tis but a shade,&#xD;
In kindred dust the form is laid;&#xD;
There is no death,-it is a birth,&#xD;
A rising heavenward from the earth."&#xD;
The next moriiing being very clear and cold, which&#xD;
IRosalind thought a favorable time to test the endur-&#xD;
ing qualities of the flower discussed between Walter&#xD;
and herself the day before the storm, she hastened&#xD;
down stairs to look after it, when she met her mother,&#xD;
whose anxious countenance immediately arrested her&#xD;
attention. "Mother, is any thing the matter?" she&#xD;
abruptly enquired.&#xD;
"Your father is very seriously ill," Mrs. Clare-&#xD;
mont replied in a tone of voice which unconsciou~ly&#xD;
betra~red her secret fears to IRosalind's quick appre-&#xD;
l~eiuisi&#xD;
$he immediately sought his presence, but only to&#xD;
listen to his incoherent words. He had passed a&#xD;
restless night with frequent paroxysms of pain, then&#xD;
showing signs of delirium. The frequei~t visits of&#xD;
the physician indicated his anxiety about the result,&#xD;
whose opinion Mrs. Claremont never asked, divining&#xD;
it too well to subject herself to the torture of being&#xD;
told. Day after day passed without bringing any&#xD;
encouragement of his recovery, aiid the only solace&#xD;
of hoping against hope was finally merged in her&#xD;
(82)&#xD;
&#xD;
k&#xD;
&#xD;
overpowering desire that, if life must be despaired&#xD;
*     of, consciousness might be restored onqe more.&#xD;
Another glance of tender recognition, another word&#xD;
spoken in the familiar tone which ~as such sweet&#xD;
music to loving hearts, was a coveted boon that would&#xD;
soften the anguish of the stroke, and be a hallowed&#xD;
memory through the coming years.&#xD;
After a night of intense solicitude, w~ien life&#xD;
struggled with death, as the morning dawned under&#xD;
a most propitious sky, and the sun was slowly gilding&#xD;
a feathery cloud in the orient, reason returned, and&#xD;
Mrs. Claremont thrilled with joy upon hearing her&#xD;
name called as of old. "What day is it? " he en-&#xD;
quired. On being informed that it was Thanksgiving&#xD;
morning, he drew his wife nearer to him, and with&#xD;
that peculiar smile which always lent a charm to his&#xD;
happiest moments, said, "Could a more lovely morn-&#xD;
ing be desired to blend the last of earth with the first&#xD;
of heaven? Mourn not for me. In a few short&#xD;
years you will come to share with me the fulness of&#xD;
a love, beside which ours here on earth, pure and&#xD;
perfect as we thought it, is but the, opening bud to&#xD;
the full blown ros~." As the eyes of the dying man&#xD;
rested on his darling Rosalind, who had scarcely left&#xD;
his bedside during his illness, a momentary pa~ng dis-&#xD;
turbed his serenity, and he closed them as if in&#xD;
prayer. Pale as a statue, she had maintained the&#xD;
most rigid composure through it all, watching every&#xD;
*     motioti, and listening to every sound, trying to catch&#xD;
the faintest ray of hope. Not a tear came to her&#xD;

&#xD;
vision of' a dream wh~ch it is the greatest joy df the,&#xD;
waking thoughts to dispel, but which alas, chilling&#xD;
all the warmth of her nature, was now to be faced&#xD;
as a reality. 'Mr. Claremont opened his eyes again,&#xD;
and motioning her to kiss him, thus addressed her,&#xD;
* "Trust your Heavenly Father as confidingly as you&#xD;
have trusted me and all will be well with you. If&#xD;
his diseipliuie shall seem sterner than mine, r~mem~&#xD;
ber that he has also as much greater power to re-.&#xD;
ward." At these words all her pent up anguish burst&#xD;
forth, and she fell weeping on the bed. He raised&#xD;
his hand feebly to fondle for the last time the pet&#xD;
curl, one shorter and more silky than the rest, a~A&#xD;
giving the other to Walter, said,&#xD;
"I go to the Promised Land,&#xD;
Wher&amp;amp;all who meet shall part up more,&#xD;
And those long parted meet again."&#xD;
His voice faltered, his hand dropped from the curl&#xD;
that had twined itself around his finger, a smile of&#xD;
ineffable love, joy and peace passed over his features,&#xD;
and his spirit crossed the portals to the unseen&#xD;
world. He had gone to his Thanksgiving feast in&#xD;
heaven.&#xD;
There is something deeply significant in the placid&#xD;
serenity of the death smile. In the tumultuous rush&#xD;
of emotions that crowd upon 'us at such a moment&#xD;
when every careless word and thoughtless act come&#xD;
like so many accusing spirits, we feel that all is for-&#xD;
given, a~nd nothing can disturb that peaceful repose.&#xD;
Is it not so?&#xD;
In that realm of higher knowledge to which the&#xD;
spirit ascends in its nearer approach to the infinite&#xD;
Source of all wisdom and love, no dross of earthly&#xD;
&#xD;
corruption will be permitted to shroud its vision, or&#xD;
dim the glow of affection's golden chain whose indis-&#xD;
soluble links bind mortality to immortality. It will&#xD;
know and feel only the power of that love which is&#xD;
stronger than death, broader and deeper~ than the&#xD;
perversities of human nature, and capable of diffus~.&#xD;
ing its own immeasurable greatness over the remem-&#xD;
brance of the errors of diis life.&#xD;
Beyond the objects of our oi4ward sense, stPonger&#xD;
than any tie of earthly recognition, deeper than any&#xD;
other emotion of the soul, stretches this invisible&#xD;
bond, invisible because immortal, aiA inmiortal be-&#xD;
cause divine. The object of love may be taken from&#xD;
us, but the power of loving is increased thereby.&#xD;
That which was only lent is withdrawn that we may&#xD;
know how much more precious is that which has&#xD;
become a part of us-the emotion incorporated into&#xD;
the spiritual nature, which is ours through eternity.&#xD;
"God gives us love. Something ~' to love&#xD;
He lends us: but when love i~ grown&#xD;
To ripeness, that on ~vhieIi it throve&#xD;
Falls ofi and love is lcft alone."&#xD;
It may be       to the intimate connection be-&#xD;
tween body and spirit that the latter leaves such a&#xD;
serene and happy expression as that presented by the&#xD;
death smile, in the same manner as the emotions in&#xD;
life are reflected through the countenance.&#xD;
To Walter this had an intense charm. "Look&#xD;
Rosa," said Le, "he is trying to tell us how happy&#xD;
he is." He felt a sacred presence pervading the&#xD;
house, uniting heaven and. earth, as it were, in the&#xD;
holy communion that attends the departing soul. To&#xD;
his hopeful, trusting nature, sorrow was a stranger.&#xD;

Life was a perpetual joy, springing, not from boyish&#xD;
thoug!itlessness or youthful indifference, but from a&#xD;
maturity of mind, which with the growth of years,&#xD;
accepted its vicissitudes of good and ill as alike&#xD;
blessings sent by a Father's hand. Even death was&#xD;
but the birth of a new life, the blessed Liberato5&#xD;

When Rosalind's emotion had subsided, nothing&#xD;

laid him beneath the pine4ree's shade, amid the&#xD;
glorious beauty of that Indian summer day, she felt&#xD;
the awakening vigor of a new life, as if spring-time&#xD;
had come, and was bursting forth in song amid the&#xD;
solemn arches of that majestic grove where so many&#xD;
had lain them down in their last sleep, but over whose&#xD;
spirits the grave had no power. Often as she had&#xD;
trodden those paths by 'her father's side and watched&#xD;
the day's soft decline through the wild lattice work of&#xD;
dense foliage which no human hand ever imitated,&#xD;
when the last rays of the setting sun sent his golden&#xD;

so glorious, nor such celestial voices floated round&#xD;
her as now. Millions of angels sung their anthems of&#xD;
welcome to him who had just yielded to the divine&#xD;
summons, which the inspiration of the hour wafted&#xD;
in voiceless yet audible strains to the quick ear of&#xD;

"That is very goo~," observed his mother.&#xD;
"I had no idea that I had a poet brother," said&#xD;
Rosalind. For a few moments her 'interest in Wal-&#xD;
ter's poetical attempt rallied her drooping spirit, but&#xD;
immediately a reaction came, when an overwhelming&#xD;
surge of grief bowed her like 'a bulrush, and she&#xD;
buried her face in the sofa and wept.&#xD;
*      *      *      *&#xD;
There are some bold, inquiring spirits who will&#xD;
never accept reason or written evidence, as proof of&#xD;
those great truths which must become a part of the&#xD;
inner consciousness, to be felt as well as believed.&#xD;
It is written, "Ask and ye shall receive; knock,&#xD;
and it shall be opened unto you;" and if the soul&#xD;
occasionally rcachqs after knowledge that belongs not&#xD;
to this world, it~ is only anticipating what shall be&#xD;
revealed hereafter. When first we stand in the&#xD;
presence of a deep affliction, as. if the fountains of&#xD;
life were suddenly unsealed, we are prompted by the&#xD;
rushing stream of emotion. i~o accept the present and&#xD;
its vicissitudes only as we can dive into futurity and&#xD;
solve the problem of life. It is perhaps fortunate for&#xD;
most people that the healing effect of time, and the&#xD;
retaining attractions of the world, divert them from&#xD;
such a field of speculation, as fruitless ~s it is per.&#xD;
plexing.&#xD;
The investigating mind of Rosalind was not to be&#xD;
satisfied with any thing short of the uttermost bound&#xD;
of human possibility, seeking from analogy with the&#xD;
most minute details of positive knowledge, the solu-&#xD;
tion of those mysteries that belong to eternity.&#xD;
This sudden diversion of the healthy vivacity of&#xD;
&#xD;
44&#xD;
d&#xD;
&#xD;
youthful feeling into the stern, rigorous channel of&#xD;
intellectual problems, soon induced a morbid state of&#xD;
mind. All former amusements and employment&#xD;
were dropped, her books neglected, and every inci-&#xD;
dent associated with the past studiously avoided.&#xD;
Her companions gradually forsook her, youth being&#xD;
of too buoyant a nature to dwell long in the presence&#xD;
of sadness, for which she cared not.&#xD;
All that a mother's unwearying love could invent,&#xD;
and a brother's untiring devotion devise, were power-&#xD;
less tp divert her from her mournful reverie, but&#xD;
they did not despair. Trusting the inherent strength&#xD;
of her character to win the victory in time over&#xD;
present faults and inconsistencies, with a sweet, ten-&#xD;
der patience they waited.&#xD;
Still she neither murmured nor made any outward&#xD;
'I   display of the keen shaft that had wrenched every&#xD;
fibre of her being. It was a silent, tearless grief.&#xD;
The elastic step was gone, the merry laugh was&#xD;
hushed, and the lustrous beauty of her eyes had&#xD;
faded. In tbeir stead came a listless indifference even&#xD;
iii minor details to which she had been wont to bring&#xD;
as much of the activity of her mind as in. the more&#xD;
important one~, while the serious decision with which&#xD;
she inflexibly resisted every attempt to interest her&#xD;
in any of the pursuits congenial to her tastes, con-&#xD;
trasted painfully ~itl~ her former enthusiasm.&#xD;
There was no more kindling rapture in th4t face,&#xD;
as the hour of sunset drew nigh, and the silQnt&#xD;
majesty of the heavens awakened fresh emotions of&#xD;
the divine Omnipresence.&#xD;

evening shadows exchanged the fantastic variety of&#xD;
her childhood's imagination for the gloomy phantoms&#xD;
of a vague, undefined sensation of dreariness; the&#xD;
moon, that shone in unclouded splendor through the&#xD;
whole week of the Indian Summer, which, owing to&#xD;
the unusual mildness of the season, had protracted&#xD;
its annual round until December, shed its pale, cold&#xD;
i'ays cheerlessly enough over copse and meadow, ra-&#xD;
vine and cliff. Every one knows the changed aspect&#xD;
of the whole material world, when one of the lights&#xD;
that radiated the inner self has merged in to shadow,&#xD;
leaving us to grope our way in darkness, until the&#xD;
radiance of a new light, emerging from ourselves,&#xD;
shall penetrate the shadow and shine with the com-&#xD;
bined brightness of both. Even Spring, with its&#xD;
freshening gales and whispering zephyrs, when floxver&#xD;
and bird, the springing grass and the murmuring&#xD;
brook, attest the birth of a new life from the ice-&#xD;
bound shroud of Winter, may suggest to the lonely&#xD;
mourner oiily the painful association of decay and.&#xD;
death which hang like a sable pall over all familiar&#xD;
objects.&#xD;
Not such was Mrs. Claremont's experience.&#xD;
Though many an hour of daily anguish and mid-&#xD;
night prayer bore witness to the severe struggle&#xD;
through which she was passing, her abiding faith&#xD;
illumined the dark valley, and nature's sweet1infiu~&#xD;
ences reminded her of the "Better Land," where&#xD;
sorrow and sickness cannot enter,&#xD;
"Beyond the clouds and beyond the tomb."&#xD;
il3anisiiing her own grief, in the presence of her&#xD;
children she always wore a cheerful smile, and&#xD;
&#xD;
Rosalind often reproached herself for the stupid in-&#xD;
difference with which she rewarded her thousand&#xD;
delicate attentions; but she treasured them in her&#xD;
mind, and marvelled at the great forbearance that&#xD;
never gave way to a word of impatience or rebuke.&#xD;
Her mother understood her temperament too well to&#xD;
attempt any futile parade of argument in order to&#xD;
convince her of her unreasonable grief, which would&#xD;
only intensify it by driving it more despairingly in-&#xD;
ward. Reason is always a comfortless comforter at&#xD;
such times. It may serve to regulate, but it was&#xD;
never intended to control the emotions. They bring&#xD;
us joy,-they bring us grief; and we havo not the&#xD;
power to say, Why comes thou?&#xD;
Submission will come at length, but it must come&#xD;
according to its own natural laws; it cannot be forced&#xD;
upon us by any mechanical art of the human intel-&#xD;
lect. It is the serene, spiritual child of prayer and&#xD;
faith, born of speechless suffering, but borne tri i~mph-&#xD;
ant in the loving Father's arms to a world of joy&#xD;
and peace.&#xD;
"Only with silence as their benediction&#xD;
God's angels come,&#xD;
When in the shadow of a geeat affliction&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Each has his own one path in life,&#xD;
A circle small within his ken-&#xD;
And a small circle too, perchance-&#xD;
We cannot all be famous men."&#xD;
No unimportant personage in the household of the&#xD;
Claremont's was. Kate Drumn'~ond, the cook. Of&#xD;
Itish descent, she was fall of the mirthful humor of&#xD;
her race, with which was combined much of the&#xD;
sober, solid sense of the Anglo-$axon. Never given&#xD;
to fine-spun theories or useless regrets, she turned&#xD;
every accident into a joke, and practiced the philos-&#xD;
ophy others spent their time in preaching. Jiavin~&#xD;
talent that would ennoble any occupation, if it had&#xD;
been developed' and cultivated ,she never subjected&#xD;
herself to' the discipline of' a thought that would&#xD;
check the wild exuberance of her nature. She had,&#xD;
a quick perception of fasts and could make" a correct&#xD;
application of principles, which, however, had no'&#xD;
more connection with each other than the random&#xD;
strokes 0g a fiddle with the clement of music.&#xD;
A trustworthy servant,, and scrupulously exact in&#xD;
every duty devolving upon her, she was not so fully&#xD;
developed in the region of conscientiousness as to be&#xD;
always careful of the propriety of speech, or wound-&#xD;
ing the feedings of others, 'when she could thus serve&#xD;
a turn fom'~ indulging her fun-loving disposition.&#xD;
('92)&#xD;
&#xD;
This was a source of annoyance to Walter, whose&#xD;
fastidiousness about any approach to dissimulation&#xD;
and strict regard for truth, often led him to reprove&#xD;
her, but with no other effect than to have a fresh&#xD;
joke served on himself.&#xD;
He was a great favorite of hers, whom she was ever&#xD;
ready to serve, whether up to her elbows in suds, or&#xD;
engaged in the more delicate art of cakes and pastry,&#xD;
the most tempting specimens of which were always&#xD;
reserved for him.&#xD;
Another inmate of the family was Milly Dayton.&#xD;
The opposite of Kate in every respect, singularly&#xD;
enough they contracted quite an intimate friendship.&#xD;
In both existed a prevalent vein of good humor&#xD;
that was never out of sorts with anybody or any-&#xD;
thing; one passing by trivial vexations as not worthy&#xD;
of notice; the other laughing them ~1own as the&#xD;
most philosophical way of disposing of them, meeting&#xD;
here on the same level. Milly was a philosopher&#xD;
whose ideas were founded on principle and method.&#xD;
Q~tiet ahd reserved, theoretical rather than practical,&#xD;
possessing a mind of great depth and i~eflnement,&#xD;
cultivated as her own private property rather than&#xD;
for the advantages it might confer on others, she was&#xD;
one of those gentle, meek spirits that resemble the&#xD;
modest little flowers growing in the lifts' of the&#xD;
rock, which elude the superficial gaze of the world's&#xD;
busy throng, but attract the attention of the student&#xD;
of nature, who discovers even here the embodiment&#xD;
'of that great law of symmetry and beauty which&#xD;
stamps every created object with the divine purpose&#xD;
of its being.&#xD;

&#xD;
She belonged to the order of dumb prophets who&#xD;
stand on the threshold of eternity, gazing into the&#xD;
divine purpose which reveals fragmentary glimpses&#xD;
of what we are and what we must become; by their&#xD;
own innate perceptions comprehending the bound~&#xD;
less capacities of the soul with its susceptibility to&#xD;
the slightest sway of virtue or passion; and praying&#xD;
for a touch of inspiration that shall serve as a key to&#xD;
unlock the prison doors of their divine conceptions,&#xD;
that they may come forth to elevate aAd purify the&#xD;
grosser, outward life of themselves and \others. To&#xD;
such the ordinai~y routine of worldly c 4res and the&#xD;
bustle of a mere business life, is like a crushing milb&#xD;
stone, grinding continually the finer sensibilities with&#xD;
a secret, acute pain. The part assigned them in the&#xD;
universe often leads through paths diverse from the&#xD;
rest of the world, as if they stood aloof from choice,&#xD;
when in reality compelled to it by a necessity of&#xD;
their spiritual organization. Enjoying society, it is&#xD;
so seldom they meet with those to whom they can&#xD;
unfold their innermost thoughts without being mis-&#xD;
understood, they shun it as if no power of response&#xD;
existed in their souls.&#xD;
Doubtless if Milly had spent her youth in an at~&#xD;
mosphere calculated to develop rather than sup-&#xD;
press her true nature, her inner life would have&#xD;
asserted itself more strongly; while on the other&#xD;
hand had she been less submissive, or her experience&#xD;
more painful, forcing nature to assert her rights, the&#xD;
hour of utterance might have come.&#xD;
Left an orphan at an early age, she was deprived&#xD;
of those tender home influences which childhood so&#xD;
&#xD;
95&#xD;
&#xD;
94&#xD;
&#xD;
so insatiately craves, and to which it is entitled.&#xD;
Plie family who took her out of p~ty, having many&#xD;
children of their own, were' well disposed and intended&#xD;
to discharge their duty' towards her. Belonging to&#xD;
that large class who consider business the paramount&#xD;
aim of life, from which childhood had no immunity,&#xD;
their Sons were t~ken from school as s6on as they&#xD;
were able to work in the field, and their daughters&#xD;
sent to assist them in pitching hay and gathering&#xD;
potatoes. Fortunately they were not endowed with&#xD;
the delicate, sensitive organization of Milly, and the&#xD;
words of command' or sharp rebuke issuing from the&#xD;
lordly head, were received as the most familiar house~&#xD;
hold dialect known among them. As they grew up,&#xD;
imbibing the same ideas that governed the parents,&#xD;
the world received a new accession to its business&#xD;
thrift ~rnd house-wifely tact. Better so than to fall&#xD;
into pernicious habits or slovenly neglect of domes-&#xD;
tic duties, which have driven many a man to dissipa-&#xD;
tion, but it is not amo~ig such natures the finer&#xD;
emotions of th~ soul are developed. Milly~s imagina-&#xD;
tive mind was not at home under these influences,&#xD;
and suffered continually in its silent craving' for&#xD;
sympathy. Possessing little of the boisterous ele-&#xD;
mont of childhood, she had an intense yearning to be&#xD;
loved and cared for, as in sunny dreams she felt again&#xD;
the warm embrace of her mother's arms and listened&#xD;
to her fond xvords of endearment, from which the&#xD;
shrill voice oC the housemaid summoned her to the&#xD;
dreaded, monotonous round of toil; when a cloud&#xD;
sometimes rested on her spiPit, but it was only tran~&#xD;
sient, always looking forward to a future which&#xD;

somehow would respond to this uiianswered longing&#xD;
of the present.&#xD;
All dreamy, poetic natures have this prophetic ~in~&#xD;
*   sight, which the unthinking asp~rai~~ arter mere&#xD;
worldly treasures can neither attain nor comprehend.&#xD;
It was impossible for people, whose constant motto&#xD;
was work, an hour of Suiiday for religious reading&#xD;
being observed very much as a disagreeable duty,&#xD;
the cross that would ensure their salvation and&#xD;
which comprised the extent of their intellectual pur-&#xD;
suits, to understand this child seer, this prophet&#xD;
maiden, whose sublime and beautiful trust buoyed&#xD;
her above her trials and imparted a degree of cheer-&#xD;
fulness that was mistaken for content.&#xD;
From eighteen to twenty she lived with an aunt, a&#xD;
sister of her father, who treated her with very little&#xD;
kindness. Unwilling to take her when a friendless&#xD;
orphan, on account of the trouble, she was little dis-&#xD;
posed to atone for it now by acting the part; of a&#xD;
mother and friend. Besides her incessant habit of&#xD;
fault-finding, the family jars between herself and&#xD;
husband gr4ed harshly on the ear of one who was&#xD;
ever dwelling on the beauty and harmony of life, as&#xD;
it might be, if the supremacy of love were acknowl-&#xD;
edged.&#xD;
The bone of contention was often very trifling,&#xD;
such as the state of the weather, one saying it was&#xD;
warm, and the other cold; and one pleasant Sunday&#xD;
was embittered by their different opinions about the&#xD;
wind, lie maintaining that it blew west by the sound&#xD;
of the bell, and she, that it blew east because her&#xD;
&#xD;
CONNECTICUT.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
head felt so bad. She was nervous, and he obsti-&#xD;
nate, two very uncongenial qualities.&#xD;
In one particular they agreed,-.the tenets of Cal-&#xD;
vinsm. Here they met~at the same altar, and bowed&#xD;
before the same God. Grace was regularly said at&#xD;
every meal, the morning and evening devotions&#xD;
punctiliously observed.&#xD;
She was more self-righteous than he, and conse-&#xD;
quently more exacting. Unmindful of her own&#xD;
faults, she held others to the most rigid standard of&#xD;
profession and morality. Even towards woman, who,&#xD;
through the pressure of want or any other cause&#xD;
yielded to temptation, she was severe and inexorable&#xD;
in her judgment, tolerating no palliation of the act&#xD;
from whatever source it came. Milly could scarcely&#xD;
have foumid a more uncongenial home. Her bound-&#xD;
less charity sought to exonerate every one from the&#xD;
charge of being as bad as appearances indicated, a&#xD;
point upon which they differed so widely as to pro-&#xD;
voke an estrangement of feeling whenever the suW&#xD;
ject was mentioned. Her devotional feelings could&#xD;
easily have been moulded to any creed embodied in&#xD;
a loving spirit, and had her aunt manifested the least&#xD;
interest in her happiness, she would have twined&#xD;
around her with all the intensity of an ardent nature&#xD;
craving something to love. As it was, an insuperable&#xD;
barrier existed between -them which it was impossi-&#xD;
ble to remove. Mihly was so sensitive, that every un-&#xD;
kind word forced back the natural flow of affection&#xD;
which would otherWise have been manifested under&#xD;
these circumstances, and might possibly have dis-&#xD;
armed s~mue of her aunt's coldness and harshness.&#xD;

A TALE OF THE&#xD;
&#xD;
It was a pleasant contract to her former life when&#xD;
she went to reside in Mrs. Claremont's family, ai~d&#xD;
one that fostered the ideal element of her nature&#xD;
which sought expression in writing. Sympathizing&#xD;
through her own experience with those sensitive,&#xD;
bleeding spirits that dot here and there the pathway&#xD;
of life, lacking the strength to buffet its stormy waves&#xD;
and faint by the wayside, whom we ti~ead on daily&#xD;
without knowing it, and the world passes by as un-&#xD;
worthy of notice because it cannot appreciate the&#xD;
wealth of soul, nor discern the ~delicate fibres quiver-&#xD;
ing beneath the unprepossessing exterior, she wished&#xD;
to plead their caus~, but, unfortunately, lack of the&#xD;
power of expression so dwarfed the natural language&#xD;
of the soul as to rob it of its vitality in the attempt&#xD;
to give it utterance. At length she hit on the idea&#xD;
of writing a novel which furnished amusement enough&#xD;
for Kate,~ who had no sympathy with abstract theories&#xD;
and metaphysical speculation, and yet liked to hear&#xD;
Milly's views, which gave her something to criticize&#xD;
and dissect. Enjoying new ideas which she chose to&#xD;
embellish in her own careless style, her impulses&#xD;
came out in a rough diamond way; sparkling, un-&#xD;
couth, yet vigorous and racy. Above all w~s that&#xD;
dominant love of fun which appropriated every thing&#xD;
to its service, no matter how serious, with which was&#xD;
mingled no small share of good sense.&#xD;
"You write a novel!" said she, ~' I should as&#xD;
sooli think of Walter setting' himself up for a stage&#xD;
player, or Miss Rosalind as a pattern young miss in&#xD;
a coquettin' shop. You'd make it as solemn as a&#xD;
fresh made wider with borrowed weeds and onions&#xD;
&#xD;
CONNECTICUT.&#xD;
in her eyes; but never mind, I'll make the fun for&#xD;
you that'1l make it as green as a country landscape."&#xD;
"I have already commenced it with too romantic&#xD;
an affair I fear; it sounds so sentimental and school&#xD;
girldike. It is so hard to find a beginning."&#xD;
"If you can write anything of that sort you ought&#xD;
to thank your stars and take cour~e. The charm&#xD;
of a story is to have so~nethin' in it that never did&#xD;
happen nor never could, and it must be full of all&#xD;
manner of shines to make it take."&#xD;
"I don't know about that. Stories are most suc-&#xD;
cessful that represent the real passions and emotions&#xD;
of the soul, and are most true of life.'~&#xD;
"Fudge! who cares whether they are true or not,&#xD;
if they are only funny, b~tt I want to hear yours to&#xD;
see what you can write, whether its worth cryin'&#xD;
over."&#xD;
"It opens with a widower, Mr. B~izport and his&#xD;
daughter, Merilinda."&#xD;
"Capital choice o' names! I like 'em, they sound&#xD;
so merry. Buzport, that means buss."&#xD;
"Mr. Buzport is her father, not her lover ,so you&#xD;
needn't come to the kissing part yet."&#xD;
"That's just like you, can't think of anything but&#xD;
a lover connected with a buss, while all I was thinking'&#xD;
on was a good hearty smack, seems as if I could&#xD;
hear it 110W."&#xD;
"The place where they lived was one of tradition-&#xD;
ary interest. In the times cf the skirmishes between&#xD;
I&#xD;
the early settlers and the savages, a man had lived&#xD;
there, a Quaker by birth, who was a great friend of&#xD;

nations. In QnC of these skirmishes, when the whites&#xD;
were victorious, one of the savages fled to him for&#xD;
protection, whom he concealed in a little cave that&#xD;
had recently been discovered in the. roar of his house,&#xD;
just large enough for a ~nian to crawl into. He was&#xD;
so grateful for this act of kindness, that somb y~ars&#xD;
afterwards when a plot was formed by the savages&#xD;
for a general massacre of the whites; he stole away&#xD;
from his tribe to inform his benefactor and have him&#xD;
raise a signal from the mouth of the cave that they&#xD;
might spare him and his family. The humane&#xD;
hearted man revolted at the idea of saving his own&#xD;
life while his brethren were sacrificed, and ho im~&#xD;
medfately set out for the wigwam of the chief bear..&#xD;
ing such messages of good will and pledges in the&#xD;
name of the whites, that they were deterred from&#xD;
their murderous purposes, and he returned in safety&#xD;
to exact the fulfilment of his pledges. Around this&#xD;
Qave an enclosure was built "~&#xD;
"1 don't like your sentiments there, I should call&#xD;
the whites the savages. What business had they to&#xD;
come and drive off them that had more right 'here&#xD;
than they had. I'd a skinned 'em all alive an' sent&#xD;
'em back to where they come from till they could&#xD;
come and trade like decent folks, and show that they&#xD;
was civilized themselves."&#xD;
Oh Kate, it makes me crawl to hear you make&#xD;
such expressions as skinning alive."&#xD;
" Oh yes, you are very feeling then but it wouldn't&#xD;
make ye feel so bad to think of the poor savages bein'&#xD;
driv' from their old homes they loved so well, an' had&#xD;
a right to."&#xD;

" I don't think that was right and have not said&#xD;
anything to sanction it, but let me go on. 'Around&#xD;
this cave an enclosure was built to co~imemorate the&#xD;
event, which Mr Buzport had removed, and substitu~&#xD;
ted in its stead a hedge supplied with seats.' "&#xD;
"That don't sound right. That enclosure might&#xD;
as well a' been a hedge as anything else, and then it&#xD;
sounds as if the seats Was put right into the hedge,&#xD;
and them would smash it all down." -&#xD;
"It was a favorite retreat of Merilinda's, and a&#xD;
delightful spot, exceedingly so on the night alluded&#xD;
to here.&#xD;
Gently the zephyrs breathed the wooing melodies&#xD;
of that bland Indian Summer day, as the sun set in&#xD;
his regal sple~idor behind the western waves, while a&#xD;
few fleecy clouds lingered behind to do the worship-&#xD;
fiul honors of his departure; and as the twilight&#xD;
deepened into the shades of evening, not a single mist&#xD;
dimmed the twinkling of the stars as they gradually&#xD;
made thcir appearance; the Milky Way with its&#xD;
myriad worlds suggested its mysterious wonders to&#xD;
the fertile imagination of Merilinda, soon to be eclipse*&#xD;
ed by the modest glory of the moon, which, shedding&#xD;
her soft, silvery light over spire and terrace, moun~&#xD;
tam and meadow, gently banishes all this splendid&#xD;
retinue from her train that she may reign supreme.&#xD;
Merrily the waves danced their joy around a magnifi-&#xD;
cent steamer proudly completing her maiden trip&#xD;
over the peaceful waters of the beautiful river which&#xD;
stretched far and wide in silent adoration."&#xD;

beauty. Her neck looked like alabaster~ and her"&#xD;

I first saw you.' Lie didn't say anything about aiiy&#xD;
hedge, I guess that had been pulled down afore his&#xD;

the title of the family descended on him. He was&#xD;
studying' for a minister, but he didn't know reachingn '&#xD;
from praying , and I've cut up the most shiiies with&#xD;
him and he never found it out. Ho wanted to know&#xD;
one day what we was gem' to have for dinner, and I&#xD;
told him, a dead calf."&#xD;
"A dead calf! " says he, "I shan't eat any of it."&#xD;
"'Very well,' says I, 'you can do just 'as you like,&#xD;
but I guess the rest on 'em will be glad enough to&#xD;
eat it.' So lie didn't eat any, and looked at 'cm so&#xD;
wishful as if he wanted to tell 'em, which' was just&#xD;
what I wanted, but he didn't. The next day we was&#xD;
gem' to have a chicken for dinner, and there was a&#xD;
little bit of a hen coop out in the yard which I got&#xD;
and cleaned up to put on the table with a live chicken&#xD;
in it, and says I to him, thinking ' you wouldn't eat&#xD;
a dead chicken I've got a live one for you,' and then&#xD;
I guess he understood what the dead calf meant."&#xD;
"Where did he preach when lie got through&#xD;
studying?"&#xD;
"Iii the kitchen. He was the awkwardest man&#xD;
you ever did see, besides bein' so scatter-brained.&#xD;
His hands come down half-way between his knees&#xD;
and his to.es, and his shoulders reached the top of his&#xD;
ears. ,lie had green eyes, white eyebrows, and yel-&#xD;
low hair that stuck up like the quills of a porcupine&#xD;
on his head. He used to come into the kitchen to&#xD;

His favorite text was the lake of brimstone and fire&#xD;
that come raining' down out of heaven. I said to him&#xD;
one day, says I, 'Sykes, rain and fire don't agree&#xD;

text where it says,&#xD;

accompanied him to a shop window where was dis-&#xD;
played a comical looking picture, representing fun&#xD;
and mischief, with the inscription, "Mother is gone&#xD;
away."&#xD;
A merry looking little sprite, with a curly head and&#xD;
dimpled hands, had found the way to hei~ mother's&#xD;
choice drawer containing her costly laces, jewelled&#xD;
fan, and various delicate fabrics, and seated on the&#xD;
floor with a kitten in her lap was creating wild havoc&#xD;
among them, while at a little distance a broken vase&#xD;
with scattered flowers, and an overturned inkstand&#xD;
deliberately pouring its contents over books and em-&#xD;
broidery, attested the child's innate love~of freedom.&#xD;
Rosahind looked at it but was far more attracted&#xD;

she took of his favorite picture a~ well as he could,&#xD;
Walter observed to a school-fellow standing by,&#xD;
"'Wouldn't yc~u like to be an artist and dwell in&#xD;
such a world of beauty?"&#xD;
"No, not I. I would rather be a spectator of the&#xD;
beauty after it is created, than work so hard to create&#xD;
it. Only think what a task it must be to get every&#xD;
tint and shade just right, and you know an unnat-&#xD;
ural painting is a most ugly thing to look at."&#xD;
"That's true. One ought to have a natural gift&#xD;
for it like Michael Angelo when he saw a divine form&#xD;
imprisoned in a block of marble. , As for the labor,&#xD;
an artist must enjoy it, thus being able to create&#xD;
from the resources of his own mind, and never can&#xD;
suffer for want of any thing to kill thought."&#xD;
"Then I suppose you will be an artist," replied&#xD;
his companion.&#xD;
Oh no, I am going to be a lawyer."&#xD;
"You a lawyer! impossible! I would as soon be a&#xD;
thief as a lawyer."&#xD;
"Why ? in a theoretical sense it deems to me one&#xD;
could do so much in that hin~ for promoting the web&#xD;
fare of the world, when law and government form&#xD;
the basis of society."&#xD;
"For promoting the misery of the world I should&#xD;
say, in a practical sense. They'll lie' as f~st as they&#xD;
can speak, and make black white if they can advance&#xD;
their client's cause, and make a penny by it," retorted&#xD;
his companion as he walked along.&#xD;
"Don't you think that is a funny picture," said&#xD;
Walter to Rosahind, trying a second time to get her&#xD;
interested in it. "You used to be so fond of paint-&#xD;
&#xD;
CQNNECTICUT.              113&#xD;
ings I thought you'd enjoy that, and there's just&#xD;
enough variety to suit you."&#xD;
"It is: a very pretty picture," said she, as she&#xD;
turned away.&#xD;
The artist who had quietly observedithem from&#xD;
the inside and heard their conversation, now stepped&#xD;
to the door and invited them in to look at his picture&#xD;
gallery. She could not be persuaded, much to his&#xD;
regret, hers being a face he wished, to study. The&#xD;
conversation, rambling as it was, had interested him&#xD;
on all sides, particularly between the two lads, for&#xD;
the investigating spirit it displayed in both of them&#xD;
beyond their years.&#xD;
Walter accepted the invitation, while Rosalind&#xD;
walked moodily homeward, reproaching l~erself for&#xD;
the discourtesy she had shown.&#xD;
A slight shade of impatience flitted across Walter's&#xD;
brow as he met her that night, which she observed.&#xD;
It increased the dissatisfaction already felt, and at an&#xD;
early hour she retired to her chamber.&#xD;
"Oh dear," said he to his mother after she had&#xD;
left, "I wonder if ~osalind is never going to be her-&#xD;
self again. I cannot get her interested in any thing,&#xD;
and she was once so enthusiastic. I was in onO of&#xD;
the finest picture galleries to day I ever saw, but could&#xD;
not persuade her to go in or scarcely look at a paint-&#xD;
ing which I thought particularly pretty, and one that&#xD;
would have pleased her so much once. Mother, why&#xD;
couldn't she have been more like you?"&#xD;

Not many days elapsed before Walter invited him&#xD;
to spend the evening at his mother's house. Rosalind&#xD;
as he feared, gave him a cold reception. She took&#xD;
very little part in the conversation, and even left the&#xD;
parlor before the departure of their guest. She&#xD;
looked upon him very much as an intruder, and&#xD;
anticipated frequent repetitions of his visits from the&#xD;
intimacy she saw springing up between him and&#xD;
Walter. So far as they were concerned she was glad&#xD;
of it, not being naturally a selfish person, but grief&#xD;
is always selfish, and she did not wish to have their&#xD;
own private circle broken in upon by strangers.&#xD;
They had made no new acquaintances since her&#xD;
father's death and she coveted seclusion. However,&#xD;
she always acted entirely independent of him, and&#xD;
he never urged her into conversation. Aside from&#xD;
treating her with true gentlemanly courtesy as he did&#xD;
every one, he took little notice of her. A very friend~&#xD;
ly feeling sprung up between him and Mrs. Clare-&#xD;
mont, the latter offering him the hospitality of her&#xD;
house whenever it would be agreeable to him, which&#xD;
was quite often. She could not have selected a&#xD;
more desirable companion for her. son, and his being&#xD;
several years his. senior she considered also a great&#xD;
advantage. Though only a boy, Walter's quick per-&#xD;
ceptions and moral intuitions imparted the maturity&#xD;
of manhood, so that his most intimate associates&#xD;
were always older than himself. He soon became&#xD;

reconciled to Rosalind's coldness towards his friend&#xD;
when he found he was not annoyed by it. She pur~&#xD;
sued her eccentriC way unmolested by any one, and&#xD;
apparently without interfering with the happiness of&#xD;
any. So she thought at least, and tried to quiet her&#xD;
conscience.&#xD;
One pleasant afternoon, Walter persuaded her to&#xD;
take a walk with them in the woods. She was quite&#xD;
cheerful when they' started and Ernest tried for the&#xD;
first time to draw h.er into conversation. She chat-&#xD;
ted pleasantly for a while, until he and Walter glided&#xD;
away in pursuit of a squirrel which was nimbly seal-&#xD;
in g the wall. When they met her again a singular&#xD;
transformation had taken place. She scarcely spoke,&#xD;
and watching her opportunity preceded them hbme-&#xD;
ward. The chill she left behind so clouded their&#xD;
spirits that they too walked home in silence.&#xD;

lit was a dull day in December. The snow had&#xD;
not yet whitened the earth, but the leaden grey aspect&#xD;
of the clouds portended an approaching storm.&#xD;
It was particularly a dull day to Amelia Crawford,&#xD;
who had accepted ~1rs. Claremont's offer 'of a home&#xD;
in her family th6 present winter. Her brain had&#xD;
been unusually busy for a few weeks, and now wear~&#xD;
ied and exhausted, she sat listless and sad over her&#xD;
work. Days, weeks and years passed heavily by as&#xD;
she plodded on her lonely, way after her mother's&#xD;
death, not knowing of . a single human being with&#xD;
whom she could claim kith or kin, and feeling lik&amp;amp;a&#xD;
waif on the ocean strand, waiting for another wave&#xD;
to hear her onward into the circle of the great human&#xD;
family, the only kinship she was henceforth tqknow.&#xD;
When that wave came it swopt her to the threshold&#xD;
of a new existence. Hitherto separated from all. the&#xD;
influences that stimulate to thought and action, con-&#xD;
tact with the world aroused 4neW feelings, and awak-&#xD;
ened aspirations to which she was before a stranger.&#xD;
Introduced to the society of books, history, ethics,&#xD;
romance and biography brought their treasures to&#xD;
her awakening faculties, among which ~she revelled&#xD;
with that delicious sense of rapture a fresh acquisi-&#xD;
tion of knowledge brings ~to the enquiring mind,&#xD;

&#xD;
~intil a labyrinth of wonder and perplexity opened&#xD;
before her as she began to comprehend the compib&#xD;
cated net-work of desire and aspiration, passion and&#xD;
sentiment, and other diverse agencies through which&#xD;
the human soul works out the great problem of its&#xD;
existence and destiny.&#xD;
Developing too suddenly for a healt ful activity&#xD;
of the brain, which gave her power, but 1 ot a llarmo~&#xD;
nious character, she displayed many e centricities&#xD;
that stood in the, way of gaining the fr the&#xD;
social element of her nature coveted now, though&#xD;
by the surrounding influouce~ of her Cilildilood had&#xD;
undeveloped before. The diffidence early ingrafted&#xD;
able       seldom venturing beyond a monosyp&#xD;
addressed to her, which&#xD;
made her quite an object of curiosity to Walter, who&#xD;
could not imagine h6w it was possible for any one to&#xD;
live in this bustling world without manifesting some&#xD;
j         degree of animation, and wondered whether she could&#xD;
be thinking at all or whether her mind was a vacuum.&#xD;
lie would have been astonished to know what was&#xD;
going on there. Though apparently so timid and&#xD;
quiescent, underneath the seeming dullness existed an&#xD;
energy of thought, and a determination of purpose&#xD;
not to 'be resisted or overcome. One accustomed to&#xD;
study human nature, could read this in the knitting&#xD;
of tile brow, and the compression of the lips as she&#xD;
sat earnestly plying her needle on this December&#xD;
afternoon. Little given to conversation generally,&#xD;
she was now resolutely mute, wishing no one to speak&#xD;
o 11cr, and replying briefly as possible to any ques-&#xD;
tion. Too many unpleasant memories flitted through&#xD;

her mind, too many unanswered questioning arose&#xD;
from the depths of her soul, for the wearied mental&#xD;
powers to throw off and play the agreeable. Milly&#xD;
sat at another window busily engaged in hemstitch-&#xD;
ing a ruffle, sometimes looking tout upon the dreary,&#xD;
angry aspect of the water in the distance as a gust&#xD;
of wind howled by, and occasionally stealing a glance&#xD;
at Amelia, as if desirous to enter into conversation if&#xD;
she only knew what to say. There were many points&#xD;
of resemblance between the two, which unfortunate-&#xD;
ly,, combined the qualities in each most unfavorable&#xD;
for 'an intimate acquaintance.&#xD;
Kate made one of her unceremonious calls, banter-&#xD;
ing Milly about her ruffle which sile "was very sure&#xD;
meant something' out of the common course, or she&#xD;
would not be doin' such finery work instead of writ-&#xD;
in' her novel," sending a blush to Milly's cl~eeksand&#xD;
almost bringing a ~niile to Amelia's motionless lips&#xD;
on witnessing her confusion.&#xD;
Suddenly recollecting that her presence had been&#xD;
requested in Mrs. Claremont's room she iA'imediately&#xD;
withdrew, without waiting for a word of reply, and&#xD;
thus continued her remarks to Rosalind and her&#xD;
mother as she passed through the open door near&#xD;
which the former was seated.&#xD;
"There's a chance for you' to get a little diversion&#xD;
by goin' into t~c other 'room and looking' at the two&#xD;
spinsters if they was only a little older, sitting' up&#xD;
there as straight as a broomstick at eacll winder, and&#xD;

body to hear the leastest hint about getting' married.&#xD;
No~w I never said a word, only .touched Milly up a&#xD;
little about a ruffle she's takin' so much pains with,&#xD;
and conscience, I don't know but there'd been a SCOUC&#xD;
right straight off if I hadn't left. I shouldn't have&#xD;

she wouldn't marry a man that drinked or smoked,&#xD;
now she's got most round the first corner, I shouldn't&#xD;
wonder if she'd change. her mind. Nobody knows&#xD;
what they'll do til! the time comes."&#xD;
'.' I don't know how it happens that she is so free&#xD;
to talk with you. She never seems disposed to enter&#xD;
into conversation with the r~st of us," observed Rosa~&#xD;
lind.&#xD;
"Just the easiest thing in the world. She thinks&#xD;
you all know so much mor'n she doe5, but I'm so&#xD;
hight-head~~ and careless, she ain't afraid of a von-&#xD;

"Milly knows enough if she only knew how to act&#xD;
it out, and I admire her good sense, having too much&#xD;
confidence in her to think she will qver swerve from&#xD;
her principles."&#xD;
Kate cast a quizzing glance, as Rosahind said this&#xD;
without looking up from her work, wondering what&#xD;
ihight be passing through her mind then, and regret~&#xD;
ting that the proprieties of her station as a domestic&#xD;
forbade the familiarity with which. she would have&#xD;
treated a similar remark from Milly.&#xD;
The early twil o'ht soon forbade their sewing long-&#xD;

CONNECTICUT.             128&#xD;
er, yet, still they sat, maintaining an, unbroken silence,&#xD;
as if some strong magnetic force riveted them to the&#xD;
spot. Milly had an intense desire to penetrate the&#xD;
inner sanctuary of Amelia's soul, but was denied the&#xD;
privilege. No human being was the confident of her&#xD;
thoughts. Perhaps a slight feeling of regret for&#xD;
some neglected duty, either through ignorance or&#xD;
thoughtlessness, which might have mitigated he~r&#xD;
mother's sufferings, lent poignancy to the sorrow&#xD;
working in the outlines of her face, anon compress~&#xD;
ing the lips still more, as she looked into the dreary&#xD;
distance, and thought of the still more dreary hours&#xD;
of the long night whose sleepless vigils she kept.&#xD;
Not for~ a life of ease was she born, and there was&#xD;
work for her to do.&#xD;
When other homes were made miserable by the&#xD;
same curse that had robbed her of childhood and&#xD;
blighted the sunniest years of youth, she could not&#xD;
be content to lead a life of comfort and self support&#xD;
merely, but what could she dQ? A question that&#xD;
implied no unbecoming self-distrust, for no one could&#xD;
seem less qualified for any ordinary undertaking.&#xD;
Apparently as cold as an iceberg she was never&#xD;
swayed by a single momentary impulse; looking '&#xD;
as Kate expressed it, "so like a moonbeam gone to&#xD;
sleep." But those dull eyes were yet to be lighted&#xD;
with the brightness of a high, spiritual life ;---that&#xD;
timid, faltering voice to grow strong in the inspire&#xD;
thin of God's truth.&#xD;
Was Milly content now that she lived in the midst&#xD;
of those tender affections which had been the Alpha&#xD;
and Omega of her day dreams, and of which she had&#xD;

early life? Not by any means. Neither was she&#xD;
unhappy.&#xD;
It is not always the severing of a tie, or the awaken-&#xD;
ing thrill of anew love, that sends us in quest of&#xD;
higher knowledge, and a grander, deeper life. It is&#xD;
the natural unfolding of the divine nature within us,&#xD;
a reaching after something we cannot grasp~-4he&#xD;
natural ci2'y of the mortal child for its immortal pa-&#xD;
rent. There come such moments to all men and&#xD;
women, varying in degree according to different&#xD;
temperaments, but none the less real,-times when&#xD;
the unutterable aspirations of the soul may bQ com-&#xD;
pared to a prisoner bird longing to soar aloft in the&#xD;
full and free exercise of its powers, and ye4 unable&#xD;
to free it~elf.&#xD;
Have patience ;-a time will arrive when an angel&#xD;
will come to unlock the prison door; ~while through.&#xD;
these years of earnest waiting the needed preparation&#xD;
goes on for the appointed work.&#xD;
There are those, patient waiters, faithful watchers,&#xD;
whose mission seems to be, to serve by waiting, and&#xD;
no idle mission is it. They are an indispensable ele-&#xD;
ment in society,-..the medium through which the&#xD;
leaven of a bolder truth than they have dared, or had&#xD;
the ability to proclaim, finds its way by their accept-&#xD;
ance of it to circles whence otherwise it would be&#xD;
excluded.&#xD;
It is true that to some only "it is given to know&#xD;
the, mystery of the kingdom of God," who are the&#xD;
ordained servants of the lowest, speaking for them in&#xD;
terms they readily understand, but which they have&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
not the capacity themselves to do. Milly had the&#xD;
knowledge but not the capacity to communicate it.&#xD;
She had an undefined consciousness, a dim fore-&#xD;
shadowing of the beauty and glory of that guarded&#xD;
sacredness of life which is reserved for those who&#xD;
drink of the cup from which J&amp;amp;sus d~ank; so ethereal&#xD;
that no outward eye can form any conception of its&#xD;
grandeur, so intensely spiritual that no outward&#xD;
sense can comprehend or explain its celestial attri-&#xD;
butes.&#xD;
Such a person could not be satisfied with an ordi-&#xD;
nary life, and she was one not likely to lead any.other~&#xD;
than an ordinary life. No stern "1 WILL" ruled that&#xD;
gentle nature ;-no indomitable persistency of pur-&#xD;
pose revealed those strong points of character which,&#xD;
if they display greater faults, press through. every&#xD;
obstacle to achieve a triumph all its own.&#xD;
Had she suffered like Amelia, or committed some.&#xD;
great error, which demanded an expiation, all the&#xD;
latent forces of her soul might have gathered in a&#xD;
single heart-throb, and, bursting from the effect of the&#xD;
pressure, startled 4he world front its slumber to set&#xD;
the seal of condemnation upon some foul wrong&#xD;
which, perpetuated from generation to generation~,&#xD;
hoary-headed with age, had obtained the reverence&#xD;
of mankind. Had she known. how her mother had&#xD;
suffered, how day by day she toiled her life away to&#xD;
obtain the pittance that was to secure a home for&#xD;
herself and child together, she might have denounced&#xD;
in terms of righteous indignation the oppression that&#xD;
still threatens the chastity of thousands of defence-&#xD;

waste their health and bloom merely to keep body&#xD;
and soul together, uncared for by those enriched&#xD;
thereby.&#xD;
An organic wrong, the inonied interest will take&#xD;
no thought for, the selfishness of which will rear a&#xD;
barrier like adamant, and woe to the trembling hand&#xD;
that shall dare to raise the feeblest blow; but what&#xD;
pow~r can resist the tongue of eloquence? Even&#xD;
selfishness stands aghast, and the little crevice through&#xD;
which the penetrating ray first finds an entrance&#xD;
closes and opens with every vibration of the popular&#xD;
heart, until the adamantine barrier gradually and&#xD;
unperceptibl3r crumbles away.&#xD;
Mr~. Dayt6n was a woman of refined tastes and&#xD;
artistic perceptions, which, not being able to indulge&#xD;
on account of the grim n~.aster. poverty, that sat like&#xD;
a relentless tyrant at the threshold of her parental&#xD;
home, hurried her into the rash step that led to&#xD;
greater evils than poverty, seeing nothing before her&#xD;
but the menial occupations then open to woman.&#xD;
Cruelly deserted by her husband shortly before the&#xD;
birth of Milly, the extra exertions she was obliged to&#xD;
make to support them soon undermined her health.&#xD;
It was a pleasant room they occupied, where the&#xD;
morning glory shaded the window, and the air was&#xD;
fragrant with lilac, and honeysuckle. Reared among&#xD;
such influences could Milly be other th~n poetic in&#xD;
her aspirations? She came like a blessed sunbeam&#xD;
to cheer, her mother's soul, and when the tie was&#xD;
severed and the child left alone, a dependent on&#xD;
strangers, how like a crushing weight the blow came!&#xD;
As Mrs. Dayton had married in opposition to all her&#xD;
&#xD;
CONNECTICUT.&#xD;
&#xD;
friends, she received none of their sympathy and.&#xD;
Milly was the more unwelcome, none of them 'being&#xD;
disposed to take. her.&#xD;
*      *      *      *&#xD;
The snow came that night accompanied by a strong&#xD;
north-easter which piled it in drifts, and imparted a&#xD;
fantastic beauty to the surface of the earth, dazzling&#xD;
the eye with its pearly whiteness as the sun' ku'rst&#xD;
forth in his greatest splendor towards noon of the&#xD;
next day. Amelia still felt an unusual depression of&#xD;
spirits, meaijhile reproaching herself for- shutting&#xD;
her eyes to ~l~e beauty of the outward world, which&#xD;
ought to buoy her upward in songs of gratitude and&#xD;
praise for the manifold blessings bestowed upon her.&#xD;
Why should she not stifle every feeltug of discontent&#xD;
and quench evei'y aspiration th4 sought a broader&#xD;
life, being satisfied to live as others did, seekii~g only&#xD;
present enjoyment and accepting the time-worn ruts&#xD;
of past ages as sufficient for the pathway of all the&#xD;
future ?&#xD;
Yes, why, that is the question. Thousands have&#xD;
asked it who, wearying of the search, have abandoned&#xD;
it as a fatal delusion. Persevere and the moment&#xD;
will come. Then no more vain questioning. Soul,&#xD;
be still, and listen for the answer&#xD;
BIWAUSN THOU ART IMMORTAL.&#xD;
She went to church that evening but not to listen&#xD;
to the preacher. He had no power to minister unto&#xD;
sorrow like hers. The sound of tfte music awakeifed&#xD;
no thrill of rapture now, though it had by no means&#xD;
lost its charm and power. She longed for intercourse&#xD;

union with in books, the inspiration of whose noble&#xD;
thoughts had hallowed many an hour of her lonely&#xD;
lot, that she might derive consolation from their&#xD;
sympathy and support, instead of wandering&#xD;
alone in doubt and despondency. And yet&#xD;
not alone. He whose midnight anguish has immor-&#xD;
talized the garden of Gethsemane was walking&#xD;
beside her,-a still greater tban he was holding her&#xD;
in his arms. Now that she was buried to all sense&#xD;
of worldly aspiration, a glorious resurrection awaited&#xD;
her.&#xD;
Suddenly as if borne on the tongue of a heavenly&#xD;
messenger came a voice, "Follow me and I will give&#xD;
thee inspiration; what thou askest I will grant."&#xD;
Then, as in the twinkling of an eye, this world&#xD;
which, but an instant before was so dark and dreary&#xD;
she would gladly have closed her eyes on it forever,&#xD;
was transformed into a paradise of light and joy,&#xD;
full of beauty, poetry, music and love; a new radi-&#xD;
ance shone from ev~ry eye, and she saw in every&#xD;
human being the type of God's own image, a fellow-&#xD;
traveler in the pilgrimage of life, and felt in each a&#xD;
companion and friend.&#xD;
*      *      *             *&#xD;
it is at such moments we truly live. Then comes&#xD;
the proof of immortality--the finite is lost in the&#xD;
infinite, and the soul touches the realities of the&#xD;
eternal world.&#xD;
Because some are not susceptible to these influ-&#xD;
ences but go sighing through life for a "witness,"&#xD;
despair has erected her throne on the hopes of thou-&#xD;
sands whom the religion of universal love might have&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
sent on their way rejoicing in the sunlight of God's&#xD;
smile. Only in the crisis of a great emotion, as the&#xD;
conflicting elements~of certain peculiar organizations&#xD;
are contending for the mastery come these marked&#xD;
phases, of the human soul. To this order of minds&#xD;
Amelia belonged, but not Milly, who was more evenly&#xD;
balanced in her mental constitution.&#xD;
It is doubtless a wise ordination that this rapt&#xD;
exaltation, this fullness of the soul's need, is not per-&#xD;
mitted to remain long, for then aspiration would be&#xD;
silenced. Neither exaltation nor depression is its&#xD;
normal state, but the crisis to note its progress,-the&#xD;
predominance of its strength or weakness. How&#xD;
often are we obliged to confront our faults again after&#xD;
we thought to have conquered them forever, yet each&#xD;
time rising with a .more resolute purpose, learning&#xD;
that it is- only by continued effort the soul gains the&#xD;
height where she can resist reacting influences, over-&#xD;
come every weakness and silence every doubt.&#xD;

CHAPTER XL&#xD;
"Thought is deeper than all speech;&#xD;
Feeling deeper than all thought;&#xD;
Souls to souls can never teach&#xD;
What unto our souls is taught."&#xD;
"Oh, for 'the tongue of an angel," soliloquized&#xD;
Milly one autumn afternoon when alone, as she sup~&#xD;
posed, but Kate was just within hearing.&#xD;
"You little wicked minx to be covetin' what you&#xD;
can't have and what wouldn't do you no . good.&#xD;
'Spose you. was an angel, what wofild it amount to?&#xD;
'Spose I should turn into one, for all the preachmn.'&#xD;
there is about it, I guess they'd wan~t me to turn into&#xD;
a sinner again and make 'em something' good to eat,&#xD;
for I couldn't do that and be flyin' up into heaven&#xD;
every minute. That's the way with these folks that&#xD;
preach so much, thc3r don't do more'n other folks&#xD;
when it comes to practice,. 'cause they are always&#xD;
thinking' of some great thing that's a goin' to be done&#xD;
sometime, nobody knows when nor who's a goin' to&#xD;
do it."&#xD;
"I didn't say I wished I was an angel, but that I&#xD;
had the tongue of 'an angel to give utterance to my&#xD;
thoughts and feelings, and I should be happier."&#xD;
"So you would, but I'm doubtful whether angels.&#xD;
have tongues. That kind o'talk they have, I b'lievo,&#xD;
ain't done by word of mouth. P11 tell you what&#xD;
(130)&#xD;
&#xD;
makes me think of angels most of anything I know&#xD;
of, and that is soap suds. When I'm a washing' and&#xD;
the suds is a flyin', why it 'pears to me I could write'&#xD;
poetry, there's something' so mighty inspiring 'in em.&#xD;
All them little bubbles look s6' pure and white, it&#xD;
seems to .me there must be an angel imprisoned in&#xD;
every one on em, and I want to let 'em out."&#xD;
It is sometimes a rest and diversion to meet with&#xD;
a person so careless of the future and satisfied with&#xD;
the present in all its phases, especially when mingled&#xD;
with so much common sense as Kate displayed.&#xD;
To Milly's weary brain it brought relief, the friction&#xD;
of the contact being just what she needed. Kate&#xD;
found enough to amuse her in the few sentences she'&#xD;
had ju~t written, in the form of an essay, and sub-&#xD;
mitted to her judgment as if she .were a 'chosen&#xD;
friend to advise, instead of a thoughtless Iiumor~~t.&#xD;
"I always knew you'd turn into a 'parson or phi-&#xD;
losopher 'fore you got through. Yo~i are sentiment~&#xD;
tal enough to write a whole budget of novels, bnt you&#xD;
ain't got the romance, or fun, or soi~ethin' to carry&#xD;

You'd make it too sober. P11 warrant you'd have&#xD;

was right over the. front stairs, and there was~ com~&#xD;

one on'em said, 'The devil's in the house! ' 'No. he&#xD;

"That's true as the four gospels. I washed out&#xD;
my old apron once and hung it on a pile of wood in&#xD;
the back yard to dry, and thought nothing . It was&#xD;
a bright, moony night, and pretty soon, Sykes, white&#xD;
as a ghost, come running' in, pantin' for breath.&#xD;
'Why Sykes,' says I, 'what's the matter with you,&#xD;
you look like a scart o~rl.' 'Oh,' says he, 'I've seen&#xD;
a Jew without a head.' 'A Jew without a head,'&#xD;

"'Never you fear,' says I, 'I'll see that you always&#xD;
have pork enough.' An' he looked up so grateful to&#xD;

&#xD;
when I started to get up, as much as ever I thought&#xD;
anything ii~ the world.' 'No you didn't,' says he,&#xD;
'how did you suppose you could stir if you were&#xD;
dead?' 'Why not,' says I, 'as well as for a hen to&#xD;
fly round aftei~ her' head is cut off?' 'Didn't you&#xD;
want the priest sent for,' says lie, 'to confess your&#xD;
sins, but' .1 guess you wouldn't have cheated him,&#xD;
though he might have been glad of your money.'&#xD;
'Time priest,' says I, 'I could bite his he ad off, and&#xD;
lie never'd' know it.' 'Well,' says he, 'you needn't&#xD;
think you can ever deceive rue, or I can always de~&#xD;
tect you.' Thinks I to myself, 'old feller, you'd pet-&#xD;
ter not be too sure. I'll make you take that back&#xD;
just as sure as I'm Kate Drummond, and you are an&#xD;
honest boy."&#xD;
"How extravagant you are to call a little sprain a&#xD;
broken f~ot."&#xD;
"Non of your moralizin' now, let me tell my&#xD;
story. I wanted your help, but I couldn't have it,&#xD;
and so I took Amelia, and it did her a wonderful&#xD;
deal of good. She was quite waked up about it.&#xD;
You know Walter has a weak spot in the good side&#xD;
of his character. He could be very easily imposed&#xD;
upon by beggars, he's so afraid of turnin' off some-&#xD;
body that's needy, so II knew how I could work him.&#xD;
I jest borrowed an old gray wig and found a pair of&#xD;
spectacle bows without any eyes, and I jest pasted on&#xD;
some' green' paper and covered 'em with isiuglass, so&#xD;
they looked jest like green glasses. I asked Mrs.&#xD;
Claremont's leave to go out that evening , and you&#xD;
know she always lets me go when I want to, and&#xD;
Amelia was to tend the door. I got her to draw up&#xD;
&#xD;
a paper representing' me as a deaf amd dumb woman,&#xD;
and she was to take it to the family. I'd no tho~ight&#xD;
when I asked her she'd be willing' to do it; but she&#xD;
fell right in with it. I guess she was glad of some-&#xD;
thin' for a change. So I rigged myself up in some&#xD;
old rags, and the wig and spectacles, and an old hood&#xD;
I've got laid away in the attic for such occasions, and&#xD;
knocked at the side door. Amelia opened it, and&#xD;
carried the paper into the parlor, and pretty soon&#xD;
come running' back, mighty tickled. Mr. Livingston&#xD;
was there and told her she'd better not leave me&#xD;
alone a great while. I 'sposo he was afraid I should&#xD;
steal something . Pretty soon Walter came out and&#xD;
then went back and got the rest. 'I believe I shall&#xD;
give her half a dollar,' says he, 'if she should be&#xD;
really suffering' I never should forgive myself.'&#xD;
Miss Rosalind was as moody as a 'broomstick, and&#xD;
didn't say a word to let a body know what she&#xD;
thought, but Mr. Livingston suspected me at ~rst&#xD;
sight I know. There couldn't no1~ody deceive him.&#xD;
He took a lamp and come to hold it in my face, and&#xD;
then I thought I was gone for, bitt I turned from&#xD;
him and drew my tatters closer round me and heaved&#xD;
an involuntary sigh. 'Oh don't' says Walter,~'likely&#xD;
she's got some feelings left yet,' and he come and&#xD;
slipped the half dollar into my hand. I wanted to&#xD;
be so grateful for it that I started too ~quick and one&#xD;
of my isinglass eyes dropped out, and I put my hand&#xD;
up to my eyes to cover 'em so he wouldn't see it.&#xD;
'It always seems as if such poor creatures&#xD;
couldn't express their gratitude enough,' says he, 'I&#xD;
don't believe they could be so deceitful as~that.' IL'&#xD;

wanted to laugh~then, but I could have held in if it&#xD;
hadn't been for something' else. A big boy was goin'&#xD;
by under the window singing' out at the top of his&#xD;
voice, 'Pop goes th~ weasel,' when a little boy,&#xD;
passing' by at the same time, cried out still louder,&#xD;
'Where did he pop to, I want to see him?' Then I&#xD;
couldn't help laughing , but as I had got the half dol-&#xD;
lar I didn't care. But you never did see anybody so&#xD;
cut up as Walter when he found he was the only&#xD;
dupe there was. At first he thought Amelia was as&#xD;
ignorant as him,-.---and she played another trick on&#xD;
him. I reckon he always thought she wans't very&#xD;
smart, and as for that may be all the rest on us thought&#xD;
so too, but I tell you, I guess Amelia knows more' n&#xD;
we was thinking' for. He looked right straight at her&#xD;
in the eye, aAd says he, ~ Am3lia, did you know that&#xD;
was Kate?' And she looked right straight at him in&#xD;
the eye, and says she, 'Kate, is that Kate! Isn't&#xD;
she really a deaf and dumb woman ? ~ just as iiuno-&#xD;
cent now as if she just come from among angels.&#xD;
He was staggered then, he didn't know what to make&#xD;
of it. I heard~'em taking' a long time in the parlor&#xD;
about it. lie thought it was wrong to impose on a&#xD;
body's sensibilities so 'cause it harden's 'cm to real&#xD;
suffering . That's true I 'spose, but I wan't gem' to&#xD;
be cheated out of my fun. Mr. Livingston told him&#xD;
a good many anecdotes of how the beginn, classes in&#xD;
Europe grow rich in this way that he had seen. I&#xD;
'spose that's the reason he couldn't be cheated."&#xD;
"Mr Livingston has been about the world too&#xD;
much to be easily deceived. I guess he would prove&#xD;
a match for you anytime."&#xD;
&#xD;
137&#xD;
&#xD;
"A match for me! ha, I'd like to serve a joke on&#xD;
him fust rate. But he ain't one o' these familiar&#xD;
sort o' folks that you don't mind speaking' to any time.&#xD;
II. always feel as if I must stand on ceremony when&#xD;
I'm speaking' to him."&#xD;
"I am glad if there is anybody you stand in defer-&#xD;
once to. It's, a pity you couldn't be in awe of him&#xD;
all the time, and be brought into some kind of sys-&#xD;
tem."&#xD;
"I hope you don't think I'm afraid of him. With&#xD;
eyes a~ gentle as a purrin' cat's, he makes a body&#xD;
feel when he's looking' at 'em so kind o' soft and ten-&#xD;
der that they don't want to use any rough words.&#xD;
But I'd like to have him try his hand on me to bring&#xD;
me into system, wouldn't I have a gay time."&#xD;
"No danger of his trying. He knows it would&#xD;
be a hopeless task."&#xD;
"I 'spose you think I'm too awfully depraved to&#xD;
have any hopes of. It tickles me to see these folks&#xD;
that pretend to be saints, when I guess if they could&#xD;
shop their 'count books they'd find some as big sins&#xD;
set down agin 'em as ever I did. Why there's tour&#xD;

her 'fore you. ever see her, and I think you must&#xD;
have been pretty near a saint to live with her as you&#xD;

he was ditto, and so that wan't no matter. Now&#xD;

138             A TALE OP TIlE&#xD;
&#xD;
of a story there that described her, about rnakin'&#xD;
broad prayers and long faces while their hearts are&#xD;
far off; pray like a hypocrite, and fret like a scold?"&#xD;
"Don't go to raking that up, let it be dead and&#xD;
buried. I don't like to think of it."&#xD;
"You don't get rid o' me that way. What's all&#xD;
your thinking' goin' to amount to if you can't answer&#xD;
a simple question? NoW I know which I should&#xD;
rather do. I'd rather take my chance of getting' to&#xD;
heaven through a bright sunshiny track right straight&#xD;
ahead than to go up a dark lane full of sour faces&#xD;
and wry tempers, the scapegoat of a multitude of&#xD;
sins.&#xD;
"You talk as if every body was of that class&#xD;
because you happen to know of one."&#xD;
"Happen to know of one I could name a hun~&#xD;
dred. There's Mrs. Greenwood, a very saint as the&#xD;
world goes, snapping' at every innocent frolic a child&#xD;
has, and wanting' to harness a cross on to 'em as soon&#xD;
as they can run alone, so as to save 'em from purga~&#xD;
tory I 'spose, but I'd go there first."&#xD;
"Well, I know she doesn't understand children's&#xD;
nature at all, and so far as that goes, very few people&#xD;
do. They seem to forget that they have been child~.&#xD;
ren, whose wants and wills should be regarded as&#xD;
much as grown people's. I do not believe there is a&#xD;
class wronged more than they are."&#xD;
"Now you begin to talk sense. I3ut~ when you&#xD;
go to smoothing' over everything that's done under&#xD;
long-faced professions you don't do right, Milly."&#xD;
"I don't try to smooth it over. You go into such&#xD;
extravagant phrases it is of no use to try to talk or&#xD;
it&#xD;
&#xD;
CONNECTJCIJT.&#xD;
&#xD;
139&#xD;
&#xD;
reason with you. I always stood up for children&#xD;
because it is in their training this fretfulness begins.&#xD;
If parents were always pleasant to each other, as&#xD;
well as to every member of the family, their children&#xD;
would catch the same spirit, instead of growing up&#xD;
in this fretful way of speaking, a habit it is hard to&#xD;
get out of, when really no ill is meant by it."&#xD;
"Ah, you hypocrite! What good is all your praying'&#xD;
and preaching' goin' to do if a body ain't no better&#xD;
for it? Now you see it's this forcing' natur' out of&#xD;
her course in not letting' the little ones enjoy them-&#xD;
selves 'cause it's good for 'em to be crossed, that&#xD;
makes 'em so soi~ir when they get well broke in."&#xD;
"It will do very well for you to talk, Kate, who&#xD;
never had aiiy experience. Perhaps if you had half&#xD;
a dozen children ~to take care of they would some-&#xD;
times be crossed when they ought not to he, and you&#xD;
might lose your temper occasionally. That would&#xD;
not make it right, to be sure, but it shows how&#xD;
much easier it is to preach than to practice.~~&#xD;
"Any body'd think you'd had as many children&#xD;
as the old woman thai lived in a shoe to hear you&#xD;
talk, as if you knew all about 'em. I want talking'&#xD;
about myself who don't Pretend to be ~ but&#xD;
an old sinner, I want you to tell inc wherein good&#xD;
folks differ from bad ones."&#xD;

different character in his eyes from what it appears&#xD;

of the world for the knowledge so communicated,&#xD;

may be the greatest benefactor of the two, since he&#xD;
must incorporate his ideas into his own practical life&#xD;
in order to answer that great want of his soul which&#xD;
another supplies by the response of some other soul&#xD;
to this vibrating chord of human sympathy, which in&#xD;
its sweetness dispels that intense earnestness whereby&#xD;
its unuttered aspirations carve out some noble action&#xD;
as the expression of its ideal. In these two classes&#xD;

She was one of those of whom it is written,&#xD;

"This world is full of beauty, like other worlds above;&#xD;
And, if we did our duty, it might be full of love."&#xD;
Thanksgiving came round again, being the second&#xD;
anniversary of Mr. Claremont's death. Rosalind had&#xD;
been more cheery of Iat~, and since the walk in' the&#xD;
woods where we l~ft her, she had treated Mr. Livings-&#xD;
ton with moire courtesy, but still was very far from,&#xD;
being on familiar terms with him. This day, which&#xD;
was spent in a very quiet mani~er, lie was their guest.&#xD;
A sudden change in the weather took place the night&#xD;
before, and a violent northeast snowstorm set in,&#xD;
which continued till late in the afternoon, wl~en the&#xD;
wind sud lenly changed again, and the evening was&#xD;
very cleai~ and cold. Rosalind was suffering from a&#xD;
severe co~d which combined With the storm to make&#xD;
her feel niore gloomy than usual.&#xD;
In the evening, as the family were pleasantly chat-&#xD;
ting around the festive board after having done full&#xD;
justice to its contents, they were starthxl by a rapid&#xD;
knock at the side door. "Will somebody please come&#xD;
and help us, for mother is dying and father is crazy,&#xD;
and the fire's gone out, ,and what will become of poor&#xD;
little sissy and me?" came in hurried tones from a&#xD;

live, when he saw the little articles of comfort Kate&#xD;
deposited in the carriage.&#xD;
Rosalind followed them to time door, and watched&#xD;
them down the avenue as they glided over the un-&#xD;
broken crust beneath the merry twinkling of the&#xD;
stars which shine with such brilliance on a clear,&#xD;
frosty night. S~me closed the door with a shiver and&#xD;
returned to the parlor. Resting her elbow on the&#xD;

thoughtfully into the grate for some minutes, and&#xD;
then broke the silence by saying, "There is very&#xD;

rounded as you are by all that wealth or affection&#xD;
can bestow."&#xD;
"I was not referring to myself particularly, I was&#xD;
thinking of that little boy who will soon be left, per-&#xD;
haps, without a friend in the world, and be obliged&#xD;
to get his living as a street beggar."&#xD;
" You would still be his friend would you not ~&#xD;
Your mother's visit there to-night may be the source&#xD;
of joy that will atone for hours of bitter suffering.&#xD;

majority of people have to suffer far more than they&#xD;
enjoy, and this world mu.st lose its attractions."&#xD;

Rosalind cared not to pursue the theme farther,&#xD;
and she seated herself in a chair with her face turned&#xD;
from him without answering.&#xD;
lie saw that he had touched the wrong key, and&#xD;
he too was silent, meanwhile studying her attentively&#xD;
until her mother's return.&#xD;
Walter brought in a golden haired girl of three&#xD;
years whom he placed in Rosalind's lap, saying she&#xD;
must, adopt her as her name sake, her name being&#xD;
Rosie, and having blue eyes resembling her oxvi~i.&#xD;
The only attendant her mother had when Mrs. Glare-&#xD;
mont arrived there, she was standing by the bedside&#xD;
affectionately stroking her face, as if that were all&#xD;
that was needed to restore her to consciousness. The&#xD;
father, it seemed, had come home in a fit of delirium&#xD;
trenens, and his wife, being in delicate health, had&#xD;
fallen into a swoon. After taking the proper' meas-&#xD;
ures to remove him to the almshouse, where he died&#xD;
soon after~ Mrs. Claremont took home the little girl&#xD;

said Walter to* her as she surveyed them all with&#xD;
eager curiosity, seated in Rosalind's lap.&#xD;
"No, doss not, mama '11 want her 'ittle din ," lisped&#xD;
the little one.&#xD;
"What would you do if you should lose your&#xD;
mother? Who would feed and take care of you,"&#xD;

"I'se dot a 'ittle pussy."&#xD;
"What do you give her to eat?"&#xD;
"We don't have anything to dive her to eat, she&#xD;
catches her own meat."&#xD;
Saying this she jumped down to look at the pictures&#xD;
and other curiosities that met h~r eyes, appearing as&#xD;
much at home as if reared in a palace. She gained&#xD;
their affections so much that it was with great reluct-&#xD;
ance they parted with 'her, and Mrs. Claremont&#xD;
would gladly have kept her, if for no other reason&#xD;
than to awaken the interest of Rosalind in some ob-&#xD;
ject, who manifested much of her old enthusiasm in&#xD;
replenishing her scant' wardrobe and listening to her&#xD;
childish prattle.&#xD;
This was only one of many instances of a similar&#xD;
character that came under Mrs. Claremont's obs~rva-&#xD;

lull&#xD;
&#xD;
suffering among the poorer classes, arising from a&#xD;
scarcity of employment and the high prices of pro~&#xD;
visions, but more than all from the increasing vice of&#xD;
intemperance.&#xD;
Even women sometimes partook freely of the in~&#xD;
toxicating draught which their husbands were much&#xD;
more lavish to provide than food, and which often&#xD;
served as a stimulus to take its place. These were&#xD;
exceptional cases, however, as there were conipara-&#xD;
tively few women so lost to all sense of duty as&#xD;
mothers to debase themselves thus.&#xD;
Pinched by cold and hunger, and tortured by&#xD;
abuse, it was marvelous that they had the ambition&#xD;
to try to appear respectable, and the perseverance&#xD;
labor so untiringly to guard their children against&#xD;
the ill effects of the vices their fathers taught them.&#xD;
Thus Rosalind thought who often accompanied her&#xD;
mother to these abodes of wretchedness and poverty,&#xD;
but whose mind was not in a state to be profited&#xD;
thereby, and Mrs. Claremont ceased at length to take&#xD;
her with her, fearing to increase her morbid tendency&#xD;
to dwell on the dark side.&#xD;
Among those associated with Mrs. Claremont in&#xD;
this work, was ~ young lady whose overflowing zeal&#xD;
in all those tender charities that constitute such a&#xD;
charm in buddi ig womanhood cast a beneficent halo&#xD;
around her pro once in every circle, and commanded&#xD;
the respect of th most thoughtless by her unaffected&#xD;
interest in the I wly. and unfortunate. As beautiful&#xD;
in person as she was lovely in character, she might&#xD;
have been envied as a rival but for the entire absence&#xD;
of self consciousness and the unobtrusive manners&#xD;
&#xD;
and sprightly conversation which won all hearts.&#xD;
The self reliance that imparted such graceful mien&#xD;
and dignified bearing bore no trace of selfeonceit,&#xD;
and the ease with which she mingled with all classes&#xD;
left no room for the disaffection of any.&#xD;
Walter would have been exceedingly gratifle4 to&#xD;
see. a friendship springing up between her and Rosa-&#xD;
lind, thinking it might prove beneficial to the latter&#xD;
beside ~ getting her interested in something that&#xD;
would employ her mind profitably. With great re-&#xD;
gret he observed her apathy, and the inutility of&#xD;
every effort to arouse her from it. As the time was&#xD;
drawing near when he was to leave home for college,&#xD;
she was a source of great anxiety. Never having&#xD;
been separated he feared she would become still more&#xD;
Exclusive when deprived of his influence and society.&#xD;
Though little disposed to talk upon the subject he&#xD;
could see that the thought of the separation already&#xD;
depressed her spirits..&#xD;
Another member of the Benevolent Association,&#xD;
without which no city can be perfect, was Mrs. Friz-&#xD;
zlewit. She formed a sort of connecting link between&#xD;
high and low, rich and poor, an indispensable element&#xD;
in the successful prosecution of an enterprise of this&#xD;
character. She and s-race Blanche were opposites in&#xD;
every~ thing, yet both filled their respective 1)laces,&#xD;
and, by being united, universal hafinony prevailed,'&#xD;
for no one would have the presumption to hazard the&#xD;
alienation of the queenly Miss Blanche. Yoijtii and&#xD;

&#xD;
with these are combined true nobility and greatness&#xD;
of soul, the possessor reigns absolute.&#xD;
A very brisk, blithe, dapper little body was this&#xD;
Mrs. Frizzlewit, just the woman for her place. If&#xD;
she ever did make a mistake, it was in getting mar-&#xD;
ried, evidently not being fitted for that. Household&#xD;
cares pressed heavily upon her, and it was sometimes&#xD;
whispered that her home was not happy, but it was&#xD;
only a rumor.&#xD;
If sometimes fretful it was because she had mis-&#xD;
taken her mission, and instead of going from house&#xD;
to house, and from shop to shop to enlist sympathy&#xD;
and help for some unfortunate family, a task for&#xD;
which nature had fitted her, she was obliged to attend&#xD;
to menial duties at home, uncongenial to her tastes&#xD;
and inclination. Not that she did not love her family,&#xD;
but was animated by a ruling passion for helping&#xD;
others. Had she heeii able to hire servants this diffi-&#xD;
culty would have been, obviated in a great degree.&#xD;
Her husband was poor and the whole care of the&#xD;
children devolved upon her. However, she always&#xD;
managed to take a prominent part in any benevolent&#xD;
object that sprung up, when others were pressed for&#xD;
time, and filled such a useful nook that no one could&#xD;
think of sparing her. Never baffled by repulse, most&#xD;
any disagreeable task others shunned found a ready&#xD;
instrument in her.&#xD;
Many were the heartfelt thanks arising from mis-&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
"We endow&#xD;
Those whom we love, in our fond, passionate blindneSS,&#xD;
With power upon ~ur souls too absolute&#xD;
To be a mortal's trust."&#xD;
Among the many admirers of Grace Blanche was&#xD;
Mr. Carleton, a man of middle age, and a Southerner&#xD;
by birth and education. His residence for the last&#xD;
ten years in different parts of the North had oblit-&#xD;
erated every trace of his southern breeding. An&#xD;
accomplished gentleman in the popular sense of the&#xD;
term, his shrewdness of wit and unaffected gallantry&#xD;
won his way to the most select circles, and few ladies&#xD;
could 'resist the peculiar charm of his c iiversation.&#xD;
He had a soul, tender, refined and affectionate, and&#xD;
also strong animal passions which gained the ascen-&#xD;
dency when beyond the restraints which female society&#xD;
threw around him. His real character could iiot&#xD;
escape detection from such a practiced student of&#xD;
human nature as Ernest Livingston, who felt a&#xD;
brother's\ interest in Miss Blanche, her wealth in ad-&#xD;
dition to rare charms of mind and person being a&#xD;
source of temptation to others, and. he volunteef'ed&#xD;
many words of counsel and caution which were al-&#xD;
ways accepted in the spirit in which they were given.&#xD;
She was' the youngest child of her father who doted&#xD;
upon her, and made her an heiress to. most of his&#xD;

&#xD;
CONNECTICUT.            153&#xD;
&#xD;
wealth, to the exclusion of his other children, which&#xD;
alienated their affections and left l~er comparatively&#xD;
alone. She l~ ad a stepmother, a very inefficient wo-&#xD;
man, who ne#er exerted an influence anywhere, .and&#xD;
whose experience in the world was of little worth to&#xD;
any one.&#xD;
Mr. Carleton's eye was ever on the alert, and no&#xD;
sooner did he perceive the fascinations, riches and&#xD;
beauty had in store, than he began to devise some&#xD;
measure wI: ich should chime in with the drift of her.&#xD;
feelings, to secure his grasp to such a treasure, and&#xD;
adroitly commenced his work. Without appearing&#xD;
to manifest any particular interest in her he assumed&#xD;
a mock spirit of philanthropy, and not only gave&#xD;
freely of his means, but discussed the causes and&#xD;
prevention of pauperism with an ability and zeal&#xD;
that could not fail to gain the sympathy and appro-&#xD;
bation of his hearers, and finally succeeded in win-&#xD;
ning the public confidence to such a degree that he&#xD;
filled some of the highest offices of tru~t and honor&#xD;
in the city.&#xD;
lie could allude to the victims of misfortune in&#xD;
terms of charity that would draw tears to all eyes,&#xD;
and plead for the innocence of childhood and the&#xD;
chastity of woman iii strains of eloquence that would&#xD;
send the burning tinge of shame to the most gloating&#xD;
sensualist, or the most hardened trafficker in that&#xD;
which robs a man of his reason and affectiQns. His&#xD;
praise was in every mouth and his1 smile courted in&#xD;
avery corner. No uninterested observer of his rising&#xD;
fame was Grace Blanche, the more interested because&#xD;
of hi~ indifference, showing no sign of vanity at his&#xD;

sudden elevation, nor ambition to seek higher honors.&#xD;
What she deemed most noble lie appeared to be.&#xD;
Mr. Livingston could not overcome his natural&#xD;
aversion to the man, neither did Mr. Carleton feel&#xD;
quite easy at the intimacy existing between him and&#xD;
Miss Blanche, but he was wary of his opportunities&#xD;
and in the most nonchalant manner discussed with&#xD;
her, when they met, plans that he knew would meet&#xD;
her approbation.&#xD;
He. watched her kindling eye and repressed enthu-&#xD;
siasm with suppressed emotion, never for a moment&#xD;
betraying the concealed purpose of his soul. Imper-&#xD;
ceptibly her life glided into a fairy dream where all&#xD;
sense of beauty and promptings of duty were so&#xD;
magically blended that the roses which bloomed in&#xD;
her pathway were divested of their %orns, ever win-&#xD;
ning the purest homage given to girlish innocence&#xD;
and true womanly charms. A May day Festival was&#xD;
held on the Scriptar~ plan of inviting the poor and&#xD;
the unfortunate, which originated with these devoted&#xD;
ladies who, during the previous six months, had la-&#xD;
bored so assiduously in their behalf. Speeches were&#xD;
made of the usual complimentary character, but&#xD;
foremost among them all for its disinterestedness a~d&#xD;
graphic flights of eloquence was that of Mr. Carle-&#xD;
ton. It was an ambrosial 'treat to Grace Blanche&#xD;
whose ai4istic taste for all that was beautiful lent her&#xD;
a keen appreciation of the divine gift of oratory.&#xD;
She had yet to learn ti~at it, no less than music, may&#xD;
be bestowed upon the ~roluptuary as well as the saint.&#xD;
[le watched the rapture with which she hung upon&#xD;
jiis lips, and measured ~he probabilities of the present&#xD;
&#xD;
moment for future success. He knew well the eva-&#xD;
nescent nature of such sudden popularity, and his&#xD;
own inability to sustain the character he had won,&#xD;
wheii his fame should be trumpeted to other places&#xD;
where better known. Besides, the mask assumed&#xD;
was beginning .to be burdensome and he longed for&#xD;
his old freedom from restraint. Only the evening&#xD;
before he had been traced to a place of doubtful&#xD;
fame by oi~e who had long been Suspicious of his real&#xD;
character, and the information was communicated to&#xD;
Mr. Livingston. Being one of the assembly, it was&#xD;
with ill concealed grace the latter listOned to his hypo-&#xD;
critical dashes of rhetoric. The two measured each&#xD;
other's glances as they met in the neighborhood of&#xD;
Miss Blanche. They read each other's souls, and she&#xD;
read their antagonism.&#xD;
At this juncture Mrs. Frizzlewit fortunatQly made&#xD;
her appearance and relieved all parties from their&#xD;
embarrassment. Mr. Carleton was about to turn&#xD;
awaxr somewhat disconcerted at the moment he hoped&#xD;
to win, but not in the least disheartened. Miss&#xD;
Blanche could not doubt the real, conflding friend-&#xD;
ship of the one and she dared not insult it by b~stow-&#xD;
ing on the other those approving smiles prompted by&#xD;
the occasion and the lingering breath of his own&#xD;
words, which, with that delicate tact a Woman so&#xD;
readily understands, she knew he would appreciate&#xD;

name, "will you give me ten dollars for a poor&#xD;
widow whose husband w~s killed at the great fire last&#xD;
winter? She wishes to build a house for herself and&#xD;
children, towards which I have already obtained a&#xD;
large sum, and here is a list of the donors if you&#xD;
wish to see them; Mr. Perriwinkle, Mr. Guzthorp."&#xD;
"Oh, never mind the names, here is your money,&#xD;
and may God bless you for all the good deeds you&#xD;
are doing, as he certainly will. Such disinterested&#xD;
beneficence never goes unrewarded," blandly replied&#xD;
Mr. Carleton, fixing his eyes on Miss Blanche with&#xD;
their most fascinating expression. The little black&#xD;
eyes sparkled as they turned towards Mr. Livingston,&#xD;
only to meet a courteous refusal, Mr., Carleton&#xD;
observing it walked away with her to a neighboring&#xD;
group where some half dozen ladies and gentlemen&#xD;
were discussing a dandy frolic that took place the&#xD;
evening before, which resulted in the coiiflagration&#xD;
of one of the finest buildings in the city. One of&#xD;
the company passing through a hall where repairs&#xD;
were being made, heedlessly tossed his lighted segar&#xD;
among the shavings scattered on the floor, which was&#xD;
observed by others following, but whose inoi~dinate&#xD;
exhilaration prevented them from noting the conse-&#xD;
quences, until they saw the flames bursting from the&#xD;
roof a few hours after.&#xD;
"You are just the ones I want to see," said Mrs.&#xD;
Frizzlewit, her curls shaking with enthusiasm. "Mr.&#xD;
Carleton here has ju~t given me ten dollars for some&#xD;
sufferers by fire, and I am sure that y ou will give me&#xD;
as much more."&#xD;
There was no need now to adduce the other names,&#xD;

the weight influence could produce. One of the&#xD;
group stepped back thinking to avoid a direct collis-&#xD;

"1 am sure you will not refuse met" she said, "if&#xD;
you cannot give so much, every little helps you&#xD;
know," laying her hand on his arm. lie gave her~a&#xD;
dollar, thinking himself well off to escape so. From&#xD;
the whole group she collected the ten dollars asked&#xD;
for, and straight tway sallied to another circle seated&#xD;
near the speaker's stand.&#xD;
They would gladly have made their egress, not&#xD;
from lack of sympathy or avaricious motives, but&#xD;
from tile disagreeable sensation of being continually&#xD;
importuned for money, and a secret desire to be for&#xD;
once present at any place secure from the intrusion&#xD;
of The bustling Mrs. Frizzlewit.&#xD;
" It is well for the world there are people in it like&#xD;
Mrs. Frizzlewit, but begging may become a passion&#xD;
like any othei~ pursuit," observed Mr. Livingston to&#xD;
Miss Blanche, as soon as the subject of his remark&#xD;
was beyond hearing.&#xD;
"True," replied she, "but you cannot say of it&#xD;
what you can of most any other pursuit, that it will&#xD;
ever incite to rivalry for the sake of its monopoly."&#xD;
Not much danger of that cei4ainly, and pity '~is,&#xD;
'tis true."&#xD;
"I often think so. The raising of money for any&#xD;
object is generally the most disagreeable as well as&#xD;
the hardest part of the work. I have the highest re-&#xD;

less enmity in p portion to her acti'~ity and zeal, for&#xD;
you probably know how prone the world is to attribute&#xD;
selfish motives to a person who displays the persever~&#xD;
ance really essential for the prosecution of a disin-&#xD;
terested act. She does not seem to care for it if they&#xD;
do, and goes from one to another with as much ease&#xD;
as if she wePe their agent."&#xD;
"Doubtless she considers herself so. It probably&#xD;
does not occur to her that others m4y lack her feeF&#xD;
ing of. interest, or that there is just as much reason&#xD;
why her family should have a house of their own as&#xD;
the woman she is begging for. I think she has earned&#xD;
one for her disinterested efforts in helping others,&#xD;
and I would gladly~ give ten dollars for that pur~&#xD;
pose.&#xD;
"Probably she would objeQt to that. She does not&#xD;
appear to think of herself or her own comfort at all,&#xD;
unless this business is so agreeable to her that it is&#xD;
her greatest comfort."&#xD;
"I think it is so. It does not prove because she&#xD;
is so forward that her sympathies are really quic1~er&#xD;
than those of many~ others, only a remarkable gift in&#xD;
that direction, and I am glad to see her improve it.&#xD;
At the same time I do not feel any iIlQre obligation&#xD;
to give, perhaps less, when I ki~ow how large a pro~&#xD;
portion of the money thus given does not proceed&#xD;
from pure benevolence, but from a desire to please&#xD;
and be thought public~spirited and generous-hearted.&#xD;
I admire that passage of scripture, 'Let not thy left&#xD;
hand know what thy, right hand doeth.' Do iiot un~&#xD;
derstand me as casting any reflections on Mrs. Friz~&#xD;

"That depends on his motive in doing it. Had I&#xD;
more confidence in the man I should be more ready&#xD;
to give him credit for his acts. As it is, I attribute&#xD;
them to the bas~st hypocrisy."&#xD;
He said this unconscious of the sting inflicted by&#xD;
his words upon the tenderest emotions of Grace&#xD;
Blanche. Although realizing Mr. Carleton's motives&#xD;
he had not suspected the nature of her feQhings to~&#xD;
wards him, and was glad to throw out these hints as&#xD;
a warning. Neither was she fully conscious before&#xD;
how much she had' yielded to the strength of his in-&#xD;
fluence, nor how esseiitial to her happiness his pres-&#xD;
ence had~ become. Having too much confidence in&#xD;
Mr. Livingston as a friend, and in his judgment as a&#xD;
man, to suspect him of prejudice or envy, these words&#xD;
assumed the character of an oracle, the certainty of&#xD;
which she never thought of questioning, predicting&#xD;

twenty years has fortified us to bear unnerved the&#xD;
disappointments of the greatest expectations. Then,&#xD;
if our confidence has been misplaced, it only furnishes&#xD;
another example of the fickleness of human integrity&#xD;
to which we have become accustomed, and the world&#xD;
undergoes no especial change in our eyes. But it is&#xD;
not thus when the young imagination finds for the&#xD;
first time that things are not what they seem. When&#xD;
the vei~eering drops off,. the sight is* ugly in the cx-&#xD;
treme,~ and the sensation a chilling one.&#xD;
It is almost as if a portion of our own souls is&#xD;
taken from us and the void filled by painful illusions.&#xD;
Then for a time skepticism of all men's motives pre~&#xD;
vails, and we look around in vain for some one to&#xD;
trust. Sometimes in desperation all faith in hiiffian&#xD;
goodness is cast off, and the high resolves with which&#xD;
we had started to make it felt as a power for the&#xD;
accomplishment of some noble purpose are bitterly&#xD;
cast aside as a vain delusion.&#xD;
When in the solemn and mysterious hour of disso~&#xD;
lution immortality claims its own, and we are per~&#xD;
emitted to look only on what is mortal of a departed&#xD;
friend, whose glazed eyes and rigid lips are forever&#xD;
sealed to the gushing of our s~mpatliies or the loving&#xD;
impulses of our affections, it is little we know of the&#xD;
deepest pathos in life, the most sacred sorrow, when&#xD;
the world closes like a desolate tomb around us, as&#xD;
we waken to the delusion that all the fair visions of&#xD;
joy and happiness, love and devotion, that havc risen&#xD;
before us like some enchanted garden are but deceit-&#xD;
ful shadows, and they to whom we have looked up&#xD;
hi reverencer-around whom our affections have&#xD;
&#xD;
twined like the tendrils of the vine around the oak&#xD;
for sympathy and support, have suddenly shaken us&#xD;
from their embrace, and stand before us divested of&#xD;
every superhuman virtue with which our fond imagi-&#xD;
nation had invested them. Then comes no seraphic&#xD;
vision of future bliss when those joys that have died&#xD;
to us on earth shall rise again in immortal bloom in&#xD;
the perennial garden ~ heavenly verdure, but, like&#xD;
blasted copse or blighted heather no trace of life or&#xD;
sign of x~egetation appears to revive the drooping&#xD;
spirit. Let such derive consolation~ from the follow~&#xD;
ing words of a celebrated writer, words that go so&#xD;
deep into the inner sanctuary of the soul and reveal&#xD;
so much of the real poetry of the heart-life that they&#xD;
cannot be too often repeated;&#xD;
"If ever you have had a romantic, uncalculating&#xD;
friendship,.-a boundless worship and belief in some&#xD;
hero of your soul,-.-if ever you have so loved, that&#xD;
all cold prudeiice, all selfish considerations have gone&#xD;
down like drift-wood before a river flooded with new&#xD;
rain from heaven, so that you even forgot yourself&#xD;
and were ready to cast your whole being into the&#xD;
chasm of existence, as an offering before the feet of&#xD;
another, and all for nothing,-.4f you awoke bitterly&#xD;
betrayed and deceived, still give thanks to God that&#xD;
you have had one glimpse of heaven. The door now&#xD;
shut will open again. R~joic~ that the noblest capa-&#xD;
bility of your eternal inheritance has been made&#xD;
known to you; treasure it, as the highest honor of&#xD;
your being, that ever you could so feel,-that so&#xD;
divine a guest ever possessed your soul. By such&#xD;
experiences are we taught the pathos, the sacredness&#xD;

was annihilated, and it seemed to have suddenly come&#xD;
down to her. She slowly retraced her steps, catch-&#xD;
ing a glimpse, now and then, of the graceful curve&#xD;
of the fountajix spray through the openings of the&#xD;
trees on either side, and stopped at a flower bed in&#xD;
front of the house laid out in the form of a circle,&#xD;
which had been preserved with scrupulous care in the&#xD;
exact style originally designed by her father. It&#xD;
comprised some of the rarest plants of the season,&#xD;
now in luxuriant bloom; and, glistening in their&#xD;
tear-dropsof dew she thought they never looked half&#xD;
so beautiful before.&#xD;
She stooped lovingly down to fondle them, as she&#xD;
had done in years gone by, when she pointed out&#xD;
triumphantly to her father some new law she had&#xD;
discovered relative to their organization and growth.&#xD;
While thus engaged, Earnest came up the walk, bring-&#xD;
ing her his hands full of pond lilies he had that&#xD;
morning gathered. She was dressed in a simple&#xD;
white morning wrapper with no ornament whatever,&#xD;
and the glossy ringlet ~vhich had received more thaii&#xD;
its usual care, looked glossier than ever, as, disen-&#xD;
gaging itself from the oth~rs~, ~t gently swayed in the&#xD;
shining rays~ of the morning sun.&#xD;
He had never seen her in one of thos~ trance-like&#xD;
states necessary to display her spiritual b auty ~vhen&#xD;
she was so much at peace with herself and all the&#xD;
world that nothing could disturb her ser~p nity. She&#xD;
was not communicative at such times, tile cominun-&#xD;
ings of her thoughts being of a character to9 intensely&#xD;
spiritual to be symbolized in human language. Ernest&#xD;

B&#xD;
&#xD;
was well pleased with this, being -more accustomed&#xD;
to reading the language of the soul in the lilleaments&#xD;
of the face than in the utterances of the lips.&#xD;
He conceived the happy thought of Painting her&#xD;
portrait in the act of taking the pond lilies. "What&#xD;
can be more beautiful," said he to himself.&#xD;
He returned to his rooms, and, immediately after&#xD;
breakfast set about the pleasant task, putting aside&#xD;
his other sketches, and worked at it incessantly for&#xD;
three days, making the most rapid progress. He&#xD;
wished her to know nothing of it until its completion&#xD;
when he intended to surprise her with it as a present.&#xD;
[       The~e is a delicious sense of rapture in being the&#xD;
sole repository of one's own secret. Even if another&#xD;
is to share it before it can become a reality~, there&#xD;
may be a kind of cruel pleasure in feeling that that&#xD;
one is yet in innocent ignorance of the fact. Ernest&#xD;
had reached that point when anticipation included&#xD;
the reality just enough to lend enchantment to every&#xD;
object of the physical sense as well as the diviner&#xD;
feelings. Nature spoke to him more kindly than&#xD;
before, and the subtle influence of a kindred soul,&#xD;
though unacknow1edg~d, softened into beauty every&#xD;
rugged outline of her coloring.&#xD;
The next day he was invited t~ join, a party of&#xD;
young people in an evening stroll, where he fell in&#xD;
company with Grace Blanche. The close affinity of&#xD;
tastes between them always brought them together.&#xD;
when both were present, which produced sufficient&#xD;
occasion among all who were given to gossip and&#xD;
some wh~~ were not, to link their fates together. It&#xD;

is useless to censure the public for it's interest in all&#xD;
affairs of this kind, being just as natural as to breathe&#xD;
in the fresh morning air. As they were deeply&#xD;
engaged in conversation the rest of the party with~&#xD;
drew, leaving them unconsciously to tread a path by&#xD;
themselves. When Ernest observed it lie smiled at&#xD;
thoir conceited knowledge, but was entirely satisfied&#xD;
with the position assigned to him. Rosalind was&#xD;
not invited, having lived a very secluded life since&#xD;
her father's death, and Miss Blanche filled her place&#xD;
better than any one else could. 'But of what was&#xD;
~he dreaming? Why was Rosalind so closely associated&#xD;
with his deepest thoughts? She had not even given&#xD;
one token of regard for him. It was the instinctive&#xD;
trusting nature of love, which could afford to wait&#xD;
and be patient.&#xD;
Grace Blanche felt lonely and sad, more so than&#xD;
he knew of, and the peculiar turn of his conversation&#xD;
which sometimes touched upon themes extending&#xD;
beyond this world soothed and, consoled her. It&#xD;
might have been dangerous to her happiness ultb&#xD;
lately, to form such aii intimate friendship at this&#xD;
particular time.&#xD;
Especially is this true of ordinary minds, but&#xD;
Grace Blanche had too much sense and strength of&#xD;
character for that, ~r to continue the acquaintance&#xD;
of a gentleman whc~ was open to suspicion like Mr.&#xD;
Carleton. Much a~ he had woi~ her affections, she&#xD;
was not so blinded ~s to discard wise counsel con~&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
"Thy path like most by mortals trod,&#xD;
Will have its thorns and flowers,&#xD;
Its stony steps, its velvet sod,&#xD;
Its sunshine and its showers."&#xD;
A rather eccentric genius was at this time asso-&#xD;
ciated with Kate in the kitchen department, upon&#xD;
whom she now vented her fun4oving propensity.&#xD;
Aunt Polly as she was called, had been grievously&#xD;
disappointed in her young days, and, not lavishly&#xD;
endowed with amiability of temper before, grew sour&#xD;
and morose. She seemed to cherish eternal hatred&#xD;
to the whole race of mankind, except a distant rela-&#xD;
tive who had been the Governor of a state; upon&#xD;
which fact she prided herself. She sought refuge&#xD;
under it for every imaginary insult, which was&#xD;
quickly resented with the remark, "Ain't I a cousin&#xD;
of the Governor?" This furnished great amusement&#xD;
to Kate who missed no opportunity of provoking&#xD;
her to it. Aunt Polly could not help liking her,&#xD;
although the source of constant vexation. Kate's&#xD;
kindness of heart did not fail to flow towards her,&#xD;
which, in a measure, atoned for the many jokes she&#xD;
played upon her, so that on the whole they got on&#xD;
very well together. No one could ever quarrel with&#xD;
Kate. She had too much sunny humor to prolong&#xD;
angry feelings, if she did excite them.&#xD;
(108)&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
There came one of those uncomfortable, chilly&#xD;
mornings, accompanied by a driz~Iing rain, when it&#xD;
scorns as if the earth, half repenting herself of the&#xD;
blessings she is about to confer o~ an expectant&#xD;
world, sullenly retires behind a cloud to evade the&#xD;
sun's quickening rays. A i lan that had been laid&#xD;
out for that day's work, requiring fair weather, was&#xD;
consequently defeated, so that it was comparatively&#xD;
a day of leisure, and Kate must have her fun. As&#xD;
she was clearing ax~ ay the breakfast, singing a snatch&#xD;
of a love song, she said abruptly, "Come Au~~t Polly,&#xD;
tell us some o' your experience iii courting , I love to&#xD;
hear old maids tell over their love stories." Her&#xD;
eyes darted fire as she retorted, "Don't you know&#xD;
no better ii' to insult me in that way, and I a cousin&#xD;
of the Governor ?"&#xD;
Kate replied in her usual merry tor~e, "Oh Aunt&#xD;
Polly, don't be so snappish, may be the Governor 'II&#xD;
come to see you to-day, nothing' strange, and you'll&#xD;
want to 130 in a pretty good mood. Wish I was&#xD;
cousin to the Governor, I'd make him give me a good&#xD;
fat office, an' I'd fare like a pig in the clover."&#xD;
She had a great lassion for stuffed figures. having&#xD;
among her possessions aii old mask, a hideous looking&#xD;
thing, which she fitted to quite an imposing looking&#xD;
figure, shaped of various articles, pillows and bed-&#xD;
clothing ~ollectod from the attic, duly attired, she&#xD;
placed it in the diiiing-roo m, aiid told Aunt Polly a&#xD;
gentleman wished to see her.&#xD;
"Who can it be," said she, "rna~ be 'tis the Gov-&#xD;

up, if he should ever hear of me, but I must put on&#xD;
otherr cap, and a clean apron."&#xD;
"He looks as if he might be a Governor or some-&#xD;
body," quietly replied Kate.&#xD;
Aunt Folly hastened up stairs, put on her otherr&#xD;
cap with' its capacious frifi, and, smoothing the folds&#xD;
of her clean checked apron, she opened the door into&#xD;
the dining room, when, lo and behold! instead of the&#xD;
courteous smile of the Governor, she was met by this&#xD;
horrid ,grinning figure, with its great glaring eyes,&#xD;
and mouth distended from ear to ear, Mortified and&#xD;
vexed beyond measure, she beat a rapid retreat into&#xD;
the kitchen, but Kate had shut herself into the pan-&#xD;
try convul ~cd with laughter, and she was obliged to&#xD;
defer giving vent to her ill-concealed wrath until a&#xD;
more convenient season. At this moment Rosalind&#xD;
entered, having just returned from a short walk.&#xD;
Meanwhile a great change had come over her feel-&#xD;
ings. Another wave of anguish had hurst upon her,&#xD;
well nigh sweeping away the little, oasis which so&#xD;
greatly refreshed her in her desert wanderings.&#xD;
Having gone out, as she often did, to shake off her&#xD;
melancholy feelings, she this morning returned with&#xD;
seven spirits bluer than herself. In reply to some-&#xD;
thing Aunt Polly muttered to her, which was not&#xD;
very agreeable in' her present state of mind, she did&#xD;
not speak with her usual courteous tone,-at least,&#xD;
so it seemed to Aunt Polly's disturbed temper.&#xD;
"Ye needn't feel so pert this morning, Miss Rosa,&#xD;
and as for that Mr. Livingston ye never'll catch him,&#xD;
that's what ye won't. He's a courting' or ilirtin', I&#xD;
don't know which, with that Miss Blanche, but br,&#xD;
&#xD;
he won't have none on ye, and if ye do I guess ye'11&#xD;
find him a livin' stone sure enough. I wouldn't&#xD;
trust a soul on 'em more'n I would a heap o' black&#xD;
snakes."&#xD;
This unkind and unmerited thrust of Aunt Folly's&#xD;
filled the Zneasure. Her cup was full, and needed&#xD;
only the additional drop to make it run over, which&#xD;
she was about to add herself. To be sure she did&#xD;
not care for Ernest, oh no, of course she didn't, but&#xD;
then, what was it? she was miserably unhappy. She&#xD;
reproached l~ei~self for ever thinking he c4red for&#xD;
her. As for Grace fllanche he might have her if he&#xD;
wished, of course he might, it was nothing to her.&#xD;
Aunt Polly was what might be called an odd jobber.&#xD;
She did washing, house-cleaning, carpet. mending;&#xD;
and whatever else of heayy work came in her way.&#xD;
Oonsequ~iitly she did not remain long in one place,&#xD;
and going from house to house gathered all the idle&#xD;
gossip, which lost nothing by repetition. It was her&#xD;
sole recreation, and people bore with her out of re-&#xD;
gard to her friendless position, and because her ser-&#xD;
vices were valuThle in her line. Very few cared for&#xD;
what she said, knowing her loquacious propensities,&#xD;
and little reliance was placed on what she did say.&#xD;
Ordinarily, Rosalind would not have given to her&#xD;
remarks a second thought, but the uncommon asper-&#xD;
ity with which they were spoken rendered them par-&#xD;
ticularly annoying at a time when she needed to be&#xD;
soothed instead of irritated. She was vexed with her&#xD;
for this4 needless wound to her feelings, and vexed&#xD;
with herself for allowing so trifling an incident to&#xD;
disturb her. She tried to drive the whole subject&#xD;

from her thoughts, which was not very easily done.&#xD;
Grace Blanche was a dear friend of theirs and she&#xD;
could not help feeling a deep interest in whatever&#xD;
concerned her welfare. But then to give heed to&#xD;
such senseless talk, coming as it did from one deeply&#xD;
irritated, was the height of absurdity. She knew she&#xD;
ought not for a moment to harbor such an imputa-&#xD;
tion upon the character of Ernest Livingston whether&#xD;
she cared for it or not, and soon found herself&#xD;
struggling against a new current in addition to her&#xD;
other troubles as unexpected as it was painful. She&#xD;
did not reproach herself for the manner in which&#xD;
she had fornmrly treated him, but rather approved it&#xD;
as singularly wise, since it showed that she had no&#xD;
particular ~regard for him, which might be a great&#xD;
advantage to her now. What did she reproach her-&#xD;
self for? Nothing, perhaps; b~it there was a vague&#xD;
restlessness, an undefined feeling of remorse that&#xD;
made her wretched.&#xD;
* The next morning was as delightful as it was three&#xD;
days before, but what a transformation in her. She&#xD;
did not leave her chamber until summoned to break-&#xD;
fast. Instead of the white wrapper she was dressed&#xD;
in a dark print; and her hair, carelessly smoothed&#xD;
over, showed by the somewhat tangled state of her&#xD;
curls that her fingers had neglected their task.&#xD;
11cr mother smiled on observing her, and said,&#xD;
"Well Rosa, what made you dress up so this morn-&#xD;
ing? Are you expecting company?"&#xD;
She . made an attempt t~ smile at one corner of her&#xD;
mouth, and was silent.&#xD;
Walter looked at her with mute surprise, secretly&#xD;
&#xD;
wondering what could make her so changeable.&#xD;
When th~ meal was over she went to the door and&#xD;
looked out, then immediately returned to. her cham-&#xD;
ber, disconsolate and sad.&#xD;
The sun shone in its splendor, but it shone not for&#xD;
her; the flowers bloomed in their beauty, but she&#xD;
heeded them not; the birds warbled their songs of&#xD;
thanksgiving, but they chanted the funeral dirge of&#xD;
her hopes of earthly happiness.&#xD;
As Fate would have it, Ernest came this morning&#xD;
als6, to invite her to ride. She went down without&#xD;
making any change in her appearance, and i~net his&#xD;
invitation with a cold, disdainful and prompt refusal.&#xD;
She turned abruptly away to fondle a little white-&#xD;
footed Naites~ kitten Walter brought home one eve-&#xD;
ning, which had strayed away from home and was&#xD;
now amusing herself by catching at the fountain&#xD;
spray as she lay basking in the sunshine. Ernest&#xD;
watched her sadly, contrasting this picture with the&#xD;
other, but as good outlives evil he said to himself,&#xD;
"She will yet repent this and need all the sympathy&#xD;
I can give her," and walked away.&#xD;
She did repent it before he reached the gate at&#xD;
the foot of the avenue, but it was too late. The&#xD;
cruel words had gone forth, words that were to go&#xD;
down the silent stream of time, never to be recalled&#xD;
or forgotten. Healing waters might flow over it,&#xD;
but the wound would forever leave it's scar, the&#xD;
memento of deep and bitter suffering.&#xD;
Walter was sitting in the arbor reading, where he&#xD;
could hear and see all, unobserved by them. Inex-&#xD;
pressibly pained as he was, he never uttered a word.&#xD;

of rebuke or complaint, nor alluded to it in any way.&#xD;
Rosalind did not meet him until dinner, when she&#xD;
colored deeply as his eye sought her's, though with-&#xD;
out the least suspicion that he knew what had trans~&#xD;
pired. She felt guilty of base ingratitude in thus&#xD;
wounding the feelings of his dearest friend. A&#xD;
powerful reaction took place when she returned to&#xD;
her chamber that morning, and was brought into&#xD;
close communion with her inner self; the secret&#xD;
sanctuary where all her acts and motives were laid&#xD;
bare to the probing finger of conscience. The proved&#xD;
author, of all her misery, although at first disosed&#xD;
to cast the blame on Aunt Polly, a very common&#xD;
trait in our faulty humanity, she could frame no&#xD;
excuse to justify her in a breach of courtesy which&#xD;
should have been extended to a stranger, to say&#xD;
nothing of his intimate friendship in the family and&#xD;
the uniform kindness with which he had always&#xD;
treated her. ad she been educated into the belief&#xD;

of the k~nderness and devotion that had always beemi'&#xD;
lavished upon her?&#xD;
Th6 days rolled on, bringing with them many un-&#xD;
pleasant reminiscences o~ the past, one of which&#xD;
was the little white-footed kitten. She had always&#xD;
enjoyed a special privilege which she was unwilling&#xD;
to yield-that of climbing on Rosalind's shoulders&#xD;
to play with her curls, and when tired, to 'pat her&#xD;
cheek with her paw as a signal to take her in her lap&#xD;

"What the deuce has sent you here?" said James&#xD;
Morgan, laying down his sixpence for a glass of&#xD;

the bar-room, a place where he had never been seen&#xD;
before. /&#xD;
"Your good angel, I trust," replied Walter, as he&#xD;
looked calmly round on the bloated faces that lined&#xD;
the room. Then taking James' arm, he led him&#xD;
reluctantly out just as the tempting draught was&#xD;
within his reach.&#xD;
Not a Word was said as they walked on and on to&#xD;
a wood where they seated themselves. Walter was&#xD;
the first to break the silence. "Do you love Mary&#xD;
Kingley?"&#xD;
James started at the directness of the question,&#xD;
and replied by asking an other, "Why, what Ao you&#xD;
mean by that?"&#xD;
"Because I have made a solemn pledge that makes&#xD;
it necessary to ask it. Oh James! Are you aware of&#xD;

A TALE OFt TUE&#xD;
&#xD;
bringing ruin upon yourself, and blasting the happi-&#xD;
ness of others? That day you fell from the bridge&#xD;
and were taken up senseless, I passed by Mr. King-&#xD;
ley's on my return home, and Mary stood in the&#xD;
door pale as death. I inteixded to pass without&#xD;
speaking, as you know we are not much acquainted,&#xD;
and I felt that she would not care for the notice of&#xD;
any body at that time; but without ally ceremony&#xD;
she asked me~~ hurriedly if I had seen you, and how&#xD;
you were. I told her I had, and that you were not&#xD;
considered seriously injured. Then, her voice slightly&#xD;
trembling, she asked if I knew what made you fail.&#xD;
I hesitated a moment, and seeing by her chaiigiiig&#xD;
6olor, the nervous motion of her lips, and the ~keen&#xD;
penetration of her eyes when she raised them, that&#xD;
she read the truth, and it was vain as well as wrong&#xD;
to conceal it from her, I resolved to answer~-"&#xD;
"Oh Walter! you did not tell her, did you? I&#xD;
would not have her know it for the world! Oh, my&#xD;
Mary! y6u will not cast me off! you must not!"&#xD;
"Do you suppose I would deceive her? No! I&#xD;
should want any body to tell m~r sister, and you&#xD;
ought to have seen how like a hero she bore it. As&#xD;
white a~ marble, she was firm as a statue. You know&#xD;
some girls would have fainted, or gone into hysterics.&#xD;
I was standing omi the door step, and she on the sill.&#xD;
She leaned against the side with her eyes fixed On&#xD;
that little bench under the great elm-tree where you&#xD;
used to sit together so much when you were children,&#xD;
as if beseeching it to try to save you. It was an&#xD;
awkward position for me I assure you. I did not&#xD;
know what to say next, and turned to leave. She&#xD;
&#xD;
CONNECTICUT.              179&#xD;
beckoned me to follow her into the. summer-house at&#xD;
the end of the yard. You know that stands against&#xD;
the side of the house which is not generally occupied,&#xD;
so that nobody could see or hear us. It was towards&#xD;
night when her father was liable to come home any&#xD;
moment, and I knew by her constant lookout what&#xD;
she was afraid of and saw where I could cut through&#xD;
the back yard if he did come, so he would not see&#xD;
me. I am almost afraid of that man."&#xD;
"You needn't be. he'd be glad enough to have&#xD;
you go there, and to see Mary too. lie hates me I&#xD;
know, and would hate mb if I were as good as you&#xD;
are. Mean rascal, it's lie that's made my father&#xD;
drink. I can remember when I was a little boy how&#xD;
he used to get him in there and treat him, and if it&#xD;
had not been for that, I might have been as steady&#xD;
as you are."&#xD;
"There* is no time now to talk about that, or make&#xD;
choice of epithets. Mary asked me if I did not&#xD;
think there was amiy possibility of making youi reform.&#xD;
XVhat to say I did not know. You know how many&#xD;
times II. have talked with you, James, to no purpose.&#xD;
After a few minutes pause, I said, 'I shall do all in&#xD;
my power to reclaim him, but I cannot promise you&#xD;
success.' Her eyes brightened as she replied, 'Oh&#xD;
do ! if anybody can influence him you can. Will&#xD;
you l)i'omlse to try 011cc more? I know you are one&#xD;
of James's confidential friends, or I sho~ild not have&#xD;
taken the freedom I have,' when her eyes dropped,&#xD;
and the color rushed into her checks,-how I pitied&#xD;
her! Modest and retiring as she is, I knew what a&#xD;
desperate struggle it must have cost to make such a&#xD;

confident of me, and then I am so much younger&#xD;
too, that I felt greatly honored to be entrusted with&#xD;
such a mission., My compassion and admiration were&#xD;
both so much excited that I forgot to answer until&#xD;
she looked up at me imploringly, and I could see&#xD;
the tears were fast coming into her eyes. 'I promise&#xD;
it solemnly,' said I, and liximediately bade her good&#xD;
night, for I knew she must prefer to be left alone&#xD;
then. She is a prize, James. The next day I received&#xD;
t~ letter from her in which she disclosed her plans.&#xD;
She said that if you persisted in your present cou~'se&#xD;
cvery consideration of duty must prompt Ler to break&#xD;
the engagement existing between you. 'Bat,' said&#xD;
she, 'if you can only induce hin~ to reform, and he&#xD;
should refrain entii~ely from his old habits one year,&#xD;
I will see him again at the end of' that time.'"&#xD;
"Then she refuses to see me, she despises me, Oh&#xD;
Mary! Mary!"&#xD;
"Why, James, you are beside yourself, how can&#xD;
you say that in truth? How could you ask her to&#xD;
become your wife when your love of strong drink is&#xD;
U      greater than your love for her. Certainly you would&#xD;
not have her so degrade herself, or be so false to all&#xD;
sense of self respect as to marry under such circum-&#xD;
stances. Only think of the life of misery she must&#xD;
lead. Look at your fat er, and see what your mother&#xD;
has suffered. If he h d been in that habit when&#xD;
they were married and he know it, do you think she&#xD;
would ever have forgive herself? It is bad enough&#xD;
when it cannot be helpe ."&#xD;
"She might let me see her again. At any rate, I&#xD;
will see her."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
k&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh James, do not be so heartless. Do have&#xD;
some regard for her feelings. You must know how&#xD;
tantalizing it would be to hold any farther intercourse&#xD;
with you, if she felt that it must be broken off some~&#xD;
time. I wish you could have seen her, you would&#xD;
not have any distrust of her then. She will never&#xD;
be any whiter when she lies in her coffin, her lips&#xD;
were as bloodless as they'll ever be, and yet she&#xD;
looked so trustful, so loving. I would go to the&#xD;
ends of the earth and live on bread and water, to&#xD;
serve such a being. Only think what a risk she&#xD;
runs to trust you if you will keep steady a year.&#xD;
There are ten chances to one that a man will fall&#xD;
back into his old habits when the restrainI~ is gone,&#xD;
and he has gained the prize he sought. And now&#xD;
James, as II shudder to think of the possibility of&#xD;
such a thing, if I shall be in the least instrumental&#xD;
in effecting your union, do you pbdge yourself here&#xD;
in the silence of this wood with none but God to&#xD;
witness, that you will never bring that reproach&#xD;
upon yourself, such an iinfailing source of regret to&#xD;
me, and such lifelong misery to your angel wife."&#xD;
James buried his face in his hands and wept like&#xD;
a child. For a moment Walter feared that he had&#xD;
spoken too strongly, but recollecting that former&#xD;
interviews had proved fruitless, he knew that it was&#xD;
only by a strong, decided course he could hope to&#xD;
wield any influence over him, and sought not to&#xD;
arrest the current of feeling in which alone lay the&#xD;
hope of salvation.&#xD;
At length James rose abruptly, saying, "Walter,&#xD;
]i shan't stay here any longer."&#xD;

"Why, where are you going?"&#xD;
"To the river!"&#xD;
Walter shuddered as he stepped in front of him,&#xD;
and thought what might be his intention. Laying&#xD;
his hand on his arm, he said calmly, but firmly,&#xD;
"No James, you must not go yet, I have something&#xD;
more to say to you."&#xD;
With that unconscious power Waltei~ possessed&#xD;
over others, he sway9d the impulsive James who&#xD;
sat down again, gentle and passive as a child.&#xD;
"Can you not summon the resolution t~ sa~ that&#xD;
you will never taste another drop?"&#xD;
For the first time since they left the bar-room&#xD;
James met the fi4l~gktnce of Walter's eye. He read&#xD;
in it something so confiding, so full of comfort, that&#xD;
the stroiig burst of passion was subdued, and he&#xD;
answered hopefully, " I will try if you will help me."&#xD;
"I will, to the extent of my power; but it is your&#xD;
own will that must decide your fate."&#xD;
"You, Walter, situated as you are, know nothing&#xD;
what it is for me to resist the temptations by which&#xD;
I am continually surrounded."&#xD;
A slight tone of reproach curled his lips as he said&#xD;
these words xvhich pained Walter, who felt the truth&#xD;
of the remark.&#xD;
"I admit it, James, but that is no reason wh~r I&#xD;
should not seek to save you. I have formed a plan&#xD;
for you to leave this place with all its associations,&#xD;
and beyond the reach of your present companions&#xD;
begin a new life. I know a place about six miles&#xD;
from here in a pleasant country town, where I think&#xD;
I can obtain a situation for you as clerk in a store,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
and will also see that you have a good boarding&#xD;
place, secure from the voice of temptation. An&#xD;
elderly gentleman, a friend of my mother's, lives&#xD;
there, who, III think, can be prevailed upon to take&#xD;
you iiito his family, for he is too kind..hearted t8 rc~&#xD;
fuse any opportunity of doing good. Ui~ wife would&#xD;
be a real mother to you. Now, what do you say to&#xD;
that? I will go and see about it to-morroW, if you&#xD;
say so."&#xD;
"Anything, I will do anything you advise, if it is&#xD;
to stand on my head."&#xD;
Walter laughed at the seriousness with which this&#xD;
was spoken, and they quitted the wood. When they&#xD;
reached Mr. Morgan's do or they parted.&#xD;
The next day Walter succeeded in procuring the&#xD;
desired situation, and before the week was out James&#xD;
entered on hi~ new duties. The first month seemed&#xD;
very long. He missed the excitement to which lie&#xD;
had been accustomed, and most of all he missed&#xD;
Mary's society. The thought that lie could not see&#xD;
her for a whole year distressed him greatly, but it&#xD;
helped to strengthen his resolution, so as to be per-&#xD;
initted the privilege at the end of that time. When&#xD;
he thirsted for his cup, Walter's suggestion that he&#xD;
loved it more than her made him abhor it.&#xD;
He was a young man of great promise and rare&#xD;
talent, of prepossessing appearance, which gained him&#xD;
numOrous friends and acquaintances, some of whom&#xD;
were too fond of good cheer for his advantage. Easily&#xD;
influenced, as genial characters are apt to be, unless&#xD;
endowed with an uncommon share of firmness, he&#xD;

&#xD;
was led into a career of intemperance before he was&#xD;
aware.&#xD;
At the time Mr. Ringley set up his business as&#xD;
liquor seller, Mr. Morgan was a respectable, we1bto~&#xD;
do man of the world, a~~d if he did not have such a&#xD;
marked effect in society as some others, he bid fair&#xD;
to leave his children an honest namQ. Mr. Kingley&#xD;
was poor, and. many, a favor Mr. Morgan had done&#xD;
him, being very gen~rous4mearted, and he, in pre~.&#xD;
tended friendship, would treat him. Then it was a&#xD;
practice of customary hospitality, but Mr. Kingley&#xD;
was too avaricious a man to be very free with any&#xD;
thing of his unless he expected to fill his coffers in&#xD;
return. As he grew rich on his ilbgotten gains, he&#xD;
began to despise his victin~ms when they grew poor in&#xD;
consequence. His daughter Mary was his only child,&#xD;
and his affection for her was his only redeeming&#xD;
feature. To. his wife he was 1.~aseiy lacking in kind~&#xD;
ness and refinement.&#xD;
James and Mary were about the same age, a~nd had&#xD;
always been playmates together until their affection&#xD;
ripened into love. Her father raised no objection so&#xD;
long as Mr. Morgan's fortunes were above his own,&#xD;
but, as they gradually sunk, and Jhmes became the&#xD;
dissipated son of a drunken father, he watched them&#xD;
with jealous eyes. Having do ted upon Mary and&#xD;
indulged every wish, it was very hard to say anything&#xD;
to her, but he did not spare James. He threatened&#xD;
and annoyed him in every way possible, and hurried&#xD;
him on to ruin as much as lay in his power, knowing&#xD;
very well that Mary's good sense would be sufficient&#xD;
to guard her against such mm imprudent marriage.&#xD;

'He missed no opportunity to exaggerate his faults&#xD;
in her hearing, which had the opposite effect of&#xD;
exciting her pity, and intensifying her love. Slip&#xD;
despised her father's business, and knew that whaP&#xD;
ever were Jam9s' failings, h&amp;amp; was in a great measure&#xD;
responsible for them. She felt no inclination, or&#xD;
prompting of ditty to cast him off, until she had&#xD;
made an effort at least to save him. She never&#xD;
doubted the sincerest love on his part, and that in&#xD;
her pure eyes was enough to warrant the hope of&#xD;
redemption. If that failed, surely no other earthly&#xD;
means could wrest him from the temptei~'s gm~asp.&#xD;
Walter was four or five yt~ars younger than James,&#xD;
but, as he was always forming friendships with those&#xD;
older than himself, he was strongly attached to him&#xD;
as a schoolmate, and their intimacy continued as&#xD;
they grew into manhood.&#xD;
Walter was so old for his years, that lie assumed&#xD;
a rank in society, amidwas looked up to as a friend&#xD;
and counsellor much sooner tha~m is usual for young&#xD;
men. His sincerity and earnestness won for him&#xD;
entire confidence so that Mary felt no hesitation in&#xD;
trusting him wfth this most momelitous question of&#xD;
hers. His youth relieved her of much of the enm~&#xD;
barrassment she would have experienced in speaking&#xD;
so freely of what every woman wishes to keep to&#xD;
herself, to a young maim of her own age. It was,&#xD;
as he said, a desperate struggle for her to do it, but&#xD;
what will not any of us do when a beloved one stands&#xD;
on the brink of a fearful precipice, down which he&#xD;
is to plunge from our gaze forever, unless some&#xD;
friendly hand intervenes?&#xD;

steadily exerted over him, btit as the democracy of&#xD;
childhood was merged into the exclusiveness which&#xD;
attends scholarship, James' pursuits led him into&#xD;
a different rank of associates. Again and again,&#xD;

Six weeks passed away without bringing any con-&#xD;
solation to Rosalind. She had not seen Ernest, nor&#xD;
hoard anything of him since that eventful morning.&#xD;
There could be no doubt then that she had banished&#xD;
him forever from her presence, and perhaps also&#xD;
broken the friendship existing between him and&#xD;
Walter, the thought of which alone oppressed her.&#xD;
There was just as much reason to fear that the b6nd&#xD;
of affection between herself and her father would be&#xD;
dissolved as the Th~k that bound together those two&#xD;
loving souls.&#xD;
Tlicre is a peculiar sacredness in the term friend-&#xD;

which belongs to no other human love. Family ties&#xD;
have their own particular sanctity, and the marriage&#xD;

recognizing no external bond of union,-~-.the sponta-&#xD;

and Walter, and the congeniality which had drawn.&#xD;
them iiito such close companionship that the most&#xD;
trifling minute~ of the daily life of each was unfolded&#xD;
to the other, in their discussions always assimilating&#xD;
in the end, though they might reach it by different&#xD;
opi~jons on the way. Often had she watched them&#xD;
from her chamber window as they strolled down the&#xD;
avenue, breaking a twig from the trees, or so en-&#xD;
grossed in convOr~ation they turned neither to tho&#xD;
right nor left; or sitting on the greensward in front&#xD;

she occasionally joined them-~--Ponto lazily stretched&#xD;

Mademoiselle Tabby marched up in a warlike attitude&#xD;

parade around his tail-had she heard them discourse&#xD;
of men and things with the sageness of philosophers,&#xD;
'and indulge in anecdotes that sent, their merry peals&#xD;
of laughter through the air. She could endure this&#xD;
suspense no longer,, and resolved to tell Walter the&#xD;
whole, if she could find a way to begin, but that was&#xD;
a puzzle. Innumerable obstacles beset her. She&#xD;
would not in any case betray any other f:~eling for&#xD;
Ernest than as his 'friend, whk~h she hadn't! there-&#xD;
fore, what need of precaution? She was entauglod&#xD;
in a web, not so easily .brushed away as spun.&#xD;
Of course he had no particular regard for her&#xD;
except as his friend's sister. Certainly not. Then&#xD;
it was not such a serious affa4r after all, he merely&#xD;
invited her to ride, and she~ refused~ not so cour-&#xD;
teously as she ought, and the reason? That i~mcluded&#xD;
&#xD;
:1&#xD;
ii&#xD;
&#xD;
the whole affair, and was not to be gaimisaid or&#xD;
evaded, especially by her outspoken self.&#xD;
Finally she turned philosopher, and reasoned&#xD;
wisely and well, if life could be reasoned out instead&#xD;
of, lived. It was altogether, best she should never&#xD;
~e married, sim~ce it was so hard for her to submit to&#xD;
the trials she must be prepared to meet in assuming&#xD;
the responsibilities of such a relation. But what&#xD;
had that to do with Ernest, or what she wished to&#xD;
say to Walter? Aim! instimict was more powerful&#xD;
than reason. 11cr whole soul's being was stirred&#xD;
and no incidental phrase could meet it's demands~&#xD;
in such a crisis.&#xD;
Then she decided to put all scruples aside and&#xD;
ask him simply if he knew what had become of&#xD;
Ernest that he did not come to see them as formerly.&#xD;
Here arose a choking in her throat as if that were&#xD;
an imposition not to be thought of for of course she&#xD;
knew. Then she thought of a picture he had given&#xD;
her which might be laid carelessly on the table to&#xD;
attract Walter's notice, when she could remark&#xD;
naturally enough that he had not been here lately.'&#xD;
How could she be so heartless as to treat lightly&#xD;
what had cost her so much agony? No, she would&#xD;
do no such thing, and' tolerate no disguises~ but&#xD;
manage the point some way to get information of&#xD;
him which did not, of necessity, demand an explana.&#xD;
tion. The ice once broken, possibly she might pro..&#xD;
ceed without embarrassment.&#xD;
The day was very warm and sultry, and she felt&#xD;
languid and depressed. Walter was going to be at&#xD;
home that afternoon, and she was determined to ask&#xD;

him the first time they met alone if he knew any-&#xD;
thing of Ernest. Soon after dinner ~there caine a&#xD;
vio~nt thunder shower, accompanied with hail, which&#xD;
did a great deal of damage. The hailstones were&#xD;
very large, coming with such force as to shiver ii~to&#xD;
atoms a window in the dining-room whore the blinds&#xD;
had~ just been opened to admit the light. The family&#xD;
had collected in the front hall, and Kate was the first&#xD;
to rush in to see what had happened.&#xD;
"Good heavens!" said she, "if the day o' judg-&#xD;
ment's come won't we have a merry time kicking' all&#xD;
this glass about, and pelting' each other with stones&#xD;
'fore we take our leave? A merry dance we'll have,&#xD;
and go up in the clouds."&#xD;
The storm abated, and Walter was obliged to go to&#xD;
the glazier's as soon as it was over. He did not re-&#xD;
turn until tea-time when he brought an invitation for&#xD;
them all to spend the evening out, about three miles&#xD;
distant.&#xD;
He was very much surprised and disappointed&#xD;
when Rosalind resolutely refused to go. She gen-&#xD;
erally" acceded to his wishes in such things, and he&#xD;
was almost impatient with her for so wilfully persist~&#xD;
ing in denying herself the pleasure a ride must afford&#xD;
when every thing was so bright and smiling, as if all&#xD;
earth's sorrows, like the summer's n~ ontide heat,&#xD;
must vanish before the invigorating br~ ezes and in-&#xD;
spiring emotions of such an evening.&#xD;
Tears camb into her eyes as Walter said, "Well,&#xD;
Rosa, I hope you will have a good time here all&#xD;
alone."&#xD;
Of course ~he coda not reproach him for it, but&#xD;
&#xD;
[i~&#xD;
&#xD;
reproached herself for being so selfish as to be un-&#xD;
willing to gratify him in so trifling a matter. She&#xD;
watched the carriage as it rolled slowly down the&#xD;
avenue. The slight motion of the horse's mane, as&#xD;
he set up a gentle trot, reminded her of other days&#xD;
when a little girl her father lifted her in childish&#xD;
glee to put her hands upon it, and seated her upon&#xD;
his back. A dear old creature he was, always so&#xD;
docile a child might drive him, yet full of energy&#xD;
which he still retained, although he had lost some of&#xD;

It seemed as if an age had passed since those days,&#xD;
an age that had transformed this world into a differ-&#xD;
ent sphere from what it was then, yet in outward&#xD;
aspect the same. This led her into a close investiga-&#xD;
tion of the causes that had produced the change and&#xD;
a rapid retrospect of her own experience for the last.&#xD;
three years. No very flattering picture she drew of&#xD;
herself, the background of which was of too sombre&#xD;
a hue to admit much of the sunlight necessary for&#xD;
an agreeable impression, and the finishing touch was&#xD;
not of a character to redeem it of its ugliness. She&#xD;
felt the utter sinfulness of wasting these golden&#xD;
years of her life in worse than useless~ repinings,&#xD;
shutting out of her soul those genial influences which&#xD;
God gives us to beautify and ennoble it) and refusing&#xD;

friends were so ready to lavish upon hjr. SIie did&#xD;
not pursue this train of thought long. Her mind&#xD;

engaged it that day, how to introduce Walter into&#xD;

sion wa~ to enquirer about Ernest, as her suspense iii&#xD;
that respect began to overpower her own personal&#xD;
relations in the matter. This was a course coinpar-&#xD;
atiyely easy, but now the opportunity was wanting.&#xD;
The next day he was going away, and it seemed&#xD;
almost impossible to rest another night. Then in a&#xD;
few weeks he was to leave home, and how could she&#xD;
liVe without him under these circumstances.&#xD;
After restlessly diverting herself by going from&#xD;
one thing to another to no purpose, she sat dowii by&#xD;
her chamber window which overlooked the front&#xD;
yard. It was already twilight, that hour so deeply&#xD;
suggestive of past pleasures and future hQpes, so full&#xD;
of vague yearnings to the restless wanderer, whose&#xD;
day dreams assume a spectral shape as the visionary&#xD;
hour of night approaches. She beguiled th6 weary&#xD;
moments by gazing into the dim distance which&#xD;
returned no answering smile of cheer or consolation.&#xD;
All along the unbroken stillness seemed to come an&#xD;
irresistible impetus to her ardent desire for question~&#xD;
ing Walter, until she tortured herself into the belief&#xD;
that something had really happened to Eruest, some-&#xD;
thing for which her conscience told her she would&#xD;
be responsible. Tl ore was still a faint hope of an&#xD;
opportunity that ni ht on Walter's return. A habit&#xD;
had existed between them from childhood which he&#xD;
had been particular ly careful to observe for the last&#xD;
six weeks, a good i ight kiss. If he staid out until&#xD;
she had retired to her chamber he sought entrance&#xD;
there, and would lie i~ot do it now if she. failed to&#xD;
meet them at the door on their return. Then recol-&#xD;
lecting how earnestly he had plead with her to&#xD;
&#xD;
192&#xD;
&#xD;
accompany thorn, would not his patience be exhausted&#xD;
by this time, and thus this last anchor of hope float&#xD;
14. As all visible objects began to grow indistinct&#xD;
she could just perceive the little frolicksome kitten&#xD;
performing her wild antics in the flower circle. She&#xD;
rested her head on her hand to shut out, if possible,&#xD;
these unpleasant associations.&#xD;
*      *       *      *       *&#xD;
In another chamber sat Milly and Kate discussing&#xD;
their o14 topic; the novel, which Kate broached by&#xD;
an unceremonious entrance, singing at the top of&#xD;
her voice,&#xD;
The sun was hiringg brightly&#xD;
Over the fields and the clover,&#xD;
The grasshoppers chirped,&#xD;
The bobolinks winked,&#xD;
And the little pigs squealed right merrily.&#xD;
"There's some poetry for you to put at the head&#xD;
of the second chapter, and no play of tl~c fancy.&#xD;
neither, but a real farm scene out in the country.&#xD;
That's what I call a five4egged metre."&#xD;
Milly felt unusually languid that day, and scarcely&#xD;
noticed Kate's merriment. For the last few ino~&#xD;
ments she had been watching Rosalind who went to&#xD;
a white rose-bush a~ if to pluck a rose, then suddenly&#xD;
changing her mind, returned to th9~ house; She was&#xD;
now pondering why she did not go to ride with her&#xD;
mother and Walter. Half mentally she said in a&#xD;
low voice, which Kate's quick ear readily caught.&#xD;
"So true it is that the lips may .be 'wreathed in&#xD;
smiles while the heart is torn with anguish. One&#xD;
would think iRosalind might be perfectly happy."&#xD;
"And its her own fault that she ain't. If she&#xD;
likes to be at cross pints, she must, that's all."&#xD;

"You judge her too harshly. She used to be the&#xD;
light of the house."&#xD;
"I should call her the spite of the house from the&#xD;
way she acts sometimes, but then she has always&#xD;
treated me well."&#xD;
"She is walking through the shadows now."&#xD;
"I should think she was walking' through shudders,&#xD;
and has a mighty likin' for 'em too. I should think&#xD;
she'd be afraid of ghosts in the way she treats Mr.&#xD;
Livingston. Give her as much to do as I have and&#xD;
she wouldn't h4ve no time to be hunting' 4 shad~&#xD;
ders."&#xD;
'~ Why, how does she treat him? I've wondered&#xD;
~hy he doesn't come here now."&#xD;
"I guess he won't come here again, behave as she&#xD;
did when he asked her to go to ride. I'd a sent her&#xD;
otherr side the moon chasm' after the stars."&#xD;
"I can't believe that. He will come to see Wab&#xD;
i~er. IDid he really invite her to ride?"&#xD;
"Sartain. lie had the handsomest hoss and shay&#xD;
you ever see, and he looked so happy and smiling' I&#xD;
could 'arid to heaven o~i his smile, and livcd on the&#xD;
light of his eyes when I got there. You see II mis~&#xD;
trusted what was a foot !whdn I xve~t to the door and&#xD;
see how spruce he looked, and see the hoss and team&#xD;
out at the gate. So thinks I to myself I'm goin' to&#xD;
see how this affair comes out. Well, so I xvent up&#xD;
to call Mi~ss Rosalind, and bless my stars, how she&#xD;
looked! I thought she must be dressed up to go&#xD;
out washing . It Was easy enough to change her&#xD;
frock you know, but her hair was in the same plight,&#xD;
and it would take longer to smooth out her curls,&#xD;
&#xD;
Think, says I, I hope his patience will hold out till&#xD;
she gets fixed up. If you believe me, she went down&#xD;
just as she was! What do you 'spose he thought?&#xD;
But that wan'~ the w6rst of it. You see my curiosity&#xD;
was pretty well pricked up by that time and I thought&#xD;
I'd listen right behind the screen there. lie spoke&#xD;
*      so soft and low I couldn't hear what he said~ but she&#xD;
snarled out something' as crabbed as sour vinegar,&#xD;
and then went off and left him standing' there."&#xD;
"Is thatso?"&#xD;
"I'm ready to swear to it by all the saints and&#xD;
holy virgins."&#xD;
"You needn't go so far as that Kate, but that is&#xD;
incomprehensible anyhow."&#xD;
"Don't go to usin' any stich long heavy word as&#xD;
that; come right to the pint, and say she ought to&#xD;
have her nose put out o' jint for ~uttin' such a shine&#xD;
with him. She might live a spinster and spin street&#xD;
yarn for amusement all the days of her life afore I'd.&#xD;
stand between her and the sun again."&#xD;
"What is the reason you never told of it before,&#xD;
if you knew it?"&#xD;
"You don't 'spose I'm such a fool as to tell all I&#xD;
know, do you?"&#xD;
"I don't think Rosa ever cared about marrying,&#xD;
but that needn't have prevented her from going to&#xD;
ride."&#xD;
" Oh, don't you believe that. All these young&#xD;
girls mean to be married, only they like to flirt a&#xD;
little first. I expect 'twas something' she heard, about&#xD;

"If he really loves Rosalind lie won't give her up&#xD;
so. The more faults he sees the more pity he'll have&#xD;
for her, and love her all the more."&#xD;
" Gracious Peter! if that ain't the essence of love&#xD;
extracted out of a moon-struck sunbeam.! The more&#xD;
hateful a person acts, the better folks will like 'em.&#xD;
'I2hat beats' good folks bein' no better 'n bad ones.''&#xD;
"I mean when a person sincerely loves another,&#xD;
his or her faults will not diminish that love because&#xD;
it is so strong as to overlook them in the excellence&#xD;
of other qualities which first drow it out."&#xD;
"Nonsense! But look at my hair, what if the&#xD;
bell should ring? It looks as if Moll Pitcher's&#xD;
young ones had quarreled over it and loft it in a&#xD;
fright. There's somebody comm' up now, looks like&#xD;
Mr. Livingston's ghost," and she made her exit as&#xD;
quick as she had made her entrance~&#xD;
It was not Mr. Livingston, but Mrs. Frizzlewit,&#xD;
who was now on a begging mission for a poor emi-&#xD;
grant family just arrived, and wished to see Mrs.&#xD;
Claremont and Walter. Learning that they were&#xD;
not at home, she made no stop; but immediately&#xD;
sought Miss Blanche, to consult her upon the most&#xD;
feasible plan of rendering them assistance. "If you&#xD;
will ask Mr. Livingston to contribute," said she, "you&#xD;
will do inc a great faVor, find besides, I think lie will&#xD;
be more likely to give to you than to me."&#xD;
"No, never," replied Grace Blanche with much&#xD;
spirit, "I should not ask him if there were an op-&#xD;
portunity,, and I do not know that I shall ever see&#xD;
him again."&#xD;
Mrs. Frizzlewit inherited the iiatui:al propensity of&#xD;
&#xD;
liking to gather news, especially concerning young&#xD;
people, and she was confident by the tone and man-&#xD;
ncr in which her friend spoke, that something had&#xD;
happened which would be exceedingly interesting ti&#xD;
know. No persuasion, however~, could extort any-&#xD;
thing more, and she was obliged to content herself&#xD;
with the suspicion that a misunderstanding had&#xD;
occurred between them. "A most unaccountable&#xD;
thing though," she, kept soliloquizing, and what was&#xD;
more unaccountable still, became so engrossed by it&#xD;
as to forget the farther prosecution of her mission&#xD;
for that night. The bell rung nine before, she was&#xD;
aware, and never allowing herself to be absent from&#xD;
her family later than that hour unless some uncom-&#xD;
mon occasion demanded it, s~e hurried away.&#xD;
It was quite a relief to Miss Blanche, who was&#xD;
already beginning to regret the betrayal of her own&#xD;
feelings in that unguarded remark. She also, in&#xD;
common with Rosalind, was lost in reverie at the&#xD;
time Mrs. Frizzlewit made her appearance.&#xD;
Mr. Livingston had deeply wounded her feelings&#xD;
by passing her unrecognized on the morning of his&#xD;
unfortunate adventure at Orange Grove. Pre-occu-&#xD;
pk~d as his mind then was, the air might have been&#xD;
full of Grace Blanches and he would not have seen&#xD;
them. Only one image was present to his mind.&#xD;
No matter if it was unseemly, it was capable of&#xD;
transformation, and in that light was constantly&#xD;
reappearing.&#xD;
For all this however, the shock to his sensitive&#xD;
nature was greater than he was willing to acknowb&#xD;
edge, which rebounded in another shock to Miss&#xD;

&#xD;
Blanche's equal sensitiveness at this particular time.&#xD;
He had not imagined that any thing oQUld so disturb&#xD;
his equanimity and self-possession, as he was obliged&#xD;
to confess by many instances of absence of mind&#xD;
which occurred that day.' lie came near ruining the&#xD;
picture upon which lie was at work, liy an involun-&#xD;
tary suggestion that the eyes did not sufficiently&#xD;
resemble. Rosahind's to be of any worth, forgetful&#xD;
that hers was closely veiled and put away out of sight&#xD;
until-lie knew not what. The contrast between that&#xD;
morning and the other was too painful to be ban-&#xD;
ished.&#xD;
Miss Blanche, however, knew nothing of this, and&#xD;
experienced an equally painful sensation in contrast-&#xD;
ing his friendliness towards her only two evenings&#xD;
before and his coldness now. Every one kiiows the&#xD;
chilling effect produced by meeting unrecognized&#xD;
~one whom we have learned to respect or even a cas-&#xD;
ual acquaintance, as if the sympathetic vein of human&#xD;
nature was robbed of some of its vitality thereby.&#xD;
Yet it is a very common experience, towards which&#xD;
we unconsciously contribute our own share when&#xD;
engrossed with care, or burdened with anxiety.&#xD;
Mr. Livingston was seldom, if ever, guilty before&#xD;
of such a breach of courtesy, being one of those&#xD;
persons the sight of wlioni rejoices one like the sun-&#xD;
shine after a shower; so much of the kindliness of&#xD;
the heart welled up iiito tlie look of recognition&#xD;
which no ordinary care or anxiety could repress, and&#xD;
whose respectful bearing flowed equally towards all,&#xD;
whether friend or foe, if he had any; the lady in&#xD;

Although it was with no happy sensation 1~rnest&#xD;
dcp~rtcd that unlucky morning from his brief inter-&#xD;
view with Rosaliiid, he experienced no feeling~ of&#xD;
b&#xD;

Ernest. He returned to his room and sat down to&#xD;
give the finishing touches to a painting laid aside in&#xD;
his eagerness to sketch iRosalind. When it was com-&#xD;
pleted lie proposed to himself a short walk, indulging&#xD;
a hope of coming in contact with Walter. Ho had&#xD;
not proceeded far when he met the post-boy bringing&#xD;
him' a letter. It contained a message from a near&#xD;
friend of his, an old classmate, who was fast wasting&#xD;
away in the last stage of consumption and wished to&#xD;
see him as soon as possible. Deeming it necessary&#xD;
to start next morning he had no time to lose, and&#xD;
instantly set about preparations for the journey,&#xD;
expecting to return in a few days. Seeing that his&#xD;
friend would not probably. survive~long lie did not&#xD;
leave him ag in, and after his death was detained&#xD;
several weeks ii business he desired him to attend&#xD;
to. His thou hts constantly revei'ted to Rosalind,&#xD;
and the conjec arcs she would have about him, which&#xD;
made the time cern very long. Under other circum-&#xD;
stances he would have written to Walter and explained&#xD;
his absence.&#xD;
At length the wished-for day of his return arrived,&#xD;
when he secured a seat iii the old lumbering stage&#xD;
coach which had a welcome, home-like look as it&#xD;
rumbled over the hills and valleys9 At sunset he&#xD;
was safely landed at the door of the hotel which, in&#xD;
those days, was none ~he less popular for the ruin-&#xD;
ous traffic it carried on. Scarcely observing the&#xD;
fierce altercations and rude s&amp;amp;iffling in the bar-room,&#xD;
sights and sounds that seldom failed to give hiia~ a&#xD;
painful sensation for the reminiscence they brought&#xD;
of the first and last night he ever spent in the society&#xD;
&#xD;
of staggering limbs and wandering brains, since which&#xD;
time not a drop of' champagne had passed his lips,&#xD;
he hastened by to a private entrance through which&#xD;
he gained access to his own room. Refreshing him-&#xD;
self a few moments after the heat and dust of the&#xD;
day, lie soon traced his steps in the familiar direc-&#xD;
tion of Orange Grove.&#xD;
When Mr. Claremont was married he built a large&#xD;
and elegant mansion on a landed estate formerly the&#xD;
possession of one of his wife's ancestors. He laid&#xD;
out the grounds according to his own taste, preserv-&#xD;
ing one old oak tree for its antiquity, which stood&#xD;
near the house. Mrs. Claremont had a great passion&#xD;
for orange trees, some half dozen of which were in&#xD;
fall bloom at one time. From this circumstance he&#xD;
gave their residence the poetical name of Orange&#xD;
Grove.&#xD;
As Mr. Livingston walked up the shaded avenue&#xD;
in the dusk of evening, a perfect silence reigned&#xD;
throughout the house and over the grounds. The&#xD;
rooms were not yet lighted, and there was no sign of&#xD;
any living thing save the little white-footed kitten&#xD;
capering in the flower, circle, who signified her web&#xD;
come by scampering off as fast as she could go when&#xD;
he came up, unconscious of the invisible fibres of&#xD;
the human soul she had iii her power to twinge with&#xD;
unutterable pain! She called up sd vividly the&#xD;
memory of that other morning, as to unsettle for a&#xD;
moment the confidence with which he had looked&#xD;
forward to this hour, but quickly reassuring himself&#xD;
and banishing his fears, he ascended the steps and&#xD;
pulled the bell. Kate fancied there was a slight&#xD;

tremor in his voice 'as he enquire~1 for Rosalind which&#xD;
disappeared upon being told that she was in.&#xD;
Being vexed with her Kate would not tell who the&#xD;
visitor was, but announced simply that a gentleinaa&#xD;
wished to see her. With the coolest indifference&#xD;
Rosalind descended to the parlor, neither caring nor&#xD;
guessing who her guest might be. As she met again&#xD;
those eyes that had never looked upon her but in&#xD;
kindness and love, and pressed again the hand that&#xD;
had so often pressed hers in silent sympathy, the&#xD;
floods of feeling swept away all self-control, and she&#xD;
burst into tears.&#xD;
Weep on, Rosa, those tears are the seal of thy&#xD;
baptism into a higher life.&#xD;
The barrier was dissolved. Deeper than all speech,&#xD;
more expressive than any outward symbol, was the&#xD;
impressive silence of that hour, the charm of which&#xD;
he sought not to break. It was the soul's confession.&#xD;
To him there was sweeter music in those sobs than&#xD;
ever came from sylvan lips. There was no more&#xD;
restraint or embarrassmeAt, and in parting that night,&#xD;
though the outward pledge remained unspoken, each&#xD;
felt that they were wedded before God.&#xD;
The moon, just risen, gave a sparkling radiance&#xD;
to the river whose peaceful flow they sat up long to&#xD;
watch in their respective chambers, to them symbolic&#xD;
of the quiet, noiseless manner in which their own&#xD;
lives had thus suddenly and silently merged into&#xD;
one.&#xD;
Walter and his mother did not return until nearly&#xD;
midnight. She trembled at the sound of his foot..&#xD;
steps lest he might intrude upon her meditations,&#xD;

desiring now to be left to herself. He, judging by&#xD;
the lateness of the hour and her own silence that&#xD;
she must be asleep, did not disturb her.&#xD;
There was an evident change in her the ~e~t&#xD;
morning, but being full of changes these times, no&#xD;
comment was made. It was the subdued expression&#xD;
of a soul in which suffering and sorrow had been&#xD;
assuaged by a special revelation of inward peace.&#xD;
Neither Walter nor his mother could sympathize with&#xD;
her in the peculiar spiritual experience through&#xD;
which th~ singular combination of her mental powers&#xD;
led her, which fact, doubtless, accounted for the&#xD;
extraordinary affinity existing between herself and&#xD;
her father; whose organization her own resembled in&#xD;
some of its strikii~g points.&#xD;
It was instinct, more powerful than any outward&#xD;
demonstration of affection, that drew them together~&#xD;
even in her babyhood, through which he derived his&#xD;
great influence cver her.&#xD;
At breakfast Walter joked her some in the course&#xD;
of the conversation upon the evening's entertain~&#xD;
ment, about the 9njoyn~ent she lost, to which she&#xD;
quietly' replied that she had enjoyed herself at home.&#xD;
Interesting herself in her mother's plans with more&#xD;
spirit than was her wont, and Walter being absent, a&#xD;
quiet, yet happy time they had, which was not inter-&#xD;
rupted by a single visitor. Human nature is so&#xD;
magnetic that we cannot resist the contagious influ-&#xD;
ences arising from the emotions of joy or grief. If&#xD;
t~ person is happy an involuntary radiation uncon-&#xD;
sciously raises the spirits of all within its sphere.&#xD;
Rosalind diffused this peaceful contentment over&#xD;

the whole house 'that day. Milly and Kate felt it&#xD;
whenever they came in contact with her, and many&#xD;
conjectures they held privately of what might have&#xD;
taken place the night before, but one thing Was cer-&#xD;
tam Kate said, "lie did her a mighty deal o' good&#xD;
anyhow," and became quite reconciled to the possb&#xD;
ability which Milly had suggested, "that if he really&#xD;
loved her he would have her yet,," though it did not.&#xD;
quite square with her ideas of what a young man&#xD;
should do when a young lady "cut up such a shine&#xD;
with him." She really liked Rosalind better than&#xD;
sh~ was willing to acknowledge, but Ernest was her&#xD;
ideal of perfection and she could not tolerate any&#xD;
breach of courtesy towards him from any source.&#xD;
Walter had just entered the drawing room after&#xD;
his return that evening, when Ernest was ushered&#xD;
iti. He met him with shouts of welcome, exclaim-&#xD;
ing, "'I did not know' you had come; did you know&#xD;
it Rosa?" She was silent. Not all the powers of'&#xD;
the universe could have induced her to answer 'the&#xD;
question at that moment.&#xD;
"Yes," said Ernest, "Rosa knew I had come, and&#xD;
it shows she can keep a secret," taking her hand in&#xD;
his' as he seated himself beside her on the sofa.&#xD;
Walter looked puzzled.&#xD;
"I did not know but you had cut our acquaintance&#xD;
as you did not write to Walter," said Mrs. Claremont,&#xD;
ironically, to which Walter quickly replied by way&#xD;
of turning the cQnversation, "A bad penny soon&#xD;
returns, so I had 'no fear we should i~ot see you&#xD;
again.&#xD;

left. I was gone much longer than I expected when I&#xD;
You knew where I went?" remarked Ernest.&#xD;
"'No, I went over to your room that morning&#xD;
just in season to get a glimpse of you in 'the old&#xD;
stage coach., and .1 made up my mind that as you&#xD;
had gone off without ceremony, you might return&#xD;
without ceremony, and I would let you enjoy it."~&#xD;
"Walter is such an easy genius he uever~ borrows&#xD;
any trouble for aught that happens," observed his,&#xD;
mother, "he would make light of it, and sat, 'Oh, he&#xD;
knows his own business, lie will come back when he&#xD;
gets ready, I know he will,' which nobody doubted."&#xD;

r   whole, iii spite of his assumed indifference as he said&#xD;
abstractly, "And so you did, didn't you? but it's&#xD;
been lonesome enough here without you."&#xD;
All this conversation was torture to Rosalind.&#xD;
She would have givcii worlds had they been at her&#xD;
command to have blotted out that littic page of her&#xD;
history. As Ernest held her hand he imagined lie&#xD;
could feel the blood conic and ~o; and to relieve&#xD;
her embarrassment, proposed going to an exhibition&#xD;
that evening, which in reality had no interest for&#xD;
either of them. As she rose without any hesitation&#xD;
to get ready, WaiLer glanced curiously from her 'to&#xD;
her mother, very much to the aniusem&amp;amp;nt of Ernest.&#xD;
She had not spoken since be entered the parlor, and&#xD;
her evident confusion betrayed a personal interest in.&#xD;
the matter which c~cited her mother's curiosity iiot&#xD;

him to-night when she has always been so afraid of&#xD;
his company."&#xD;
Mrs. Claremont smiled. Soon Milly came in,&#xD;
looking vei~y much amused.&#xD;
"Milly," said Walter, "was Mr. Livingston here&#xD;
last night while we were gone ? "&#xD;
"That's for you to find out," she smilingly replied.&#xD;
"Well I know how I can fit~d out, I'll make Kate&#xD;
tell me," continued he, rushing out.&#xD;
Kate, did Mr. Livingston call here last night&#xD;
in our absence?"&#xD;
"An' sure, you don't 'spose I'd be for tellin' the&#xD;
young lady's secrets do you?"&#xD;
Walter had not been so "easy" as his mother&#xD;
represented or as his own manner indicated. He had&#xD;
a great deal of anxiety about the consequences.&#xD;
The friendship of Ernest was something beyond price&#xD;
and the thought of sacrificing it he could not tolerate.&#xD;
After witnessing wh t he had~ there seemed to be&#xD;
reason for his' stayii g away, and consoled himself&#xD;
with the belief that t fings would all come out right&#xD;
yet, a favorite dogma in his creed. He knew Ernest&#xD;
too 'well to suspect ilm of any such weakness as&#xD;
breaking a friendship voluntarily because of Rosa~&#xD;
lined's incomprehensible freaks. lie might feel em-&#xD;
barrassed about calling, which led Walter to seek&#xD;
him next morning, and watch his return, deeming&#xD;
it incumbent on himself under the circumstances to&#xD;
make the first advance.&#xD;
Ernest and Rosalind walked on past the door of&#xD;
the exhibition, which it is doubtful if either knew&#xD;
&#xD;
when passing it to a favorite little dell, near the&#xD;
water's edge where he and Walter had held many a&#xD;
'lively chat and grave conversation. A fine breeze&#xD;
from the river was well calculated to cool the fevered&#xD;
brow of IRosalind; and the rising moon smiled&#xD;
beneficently on them as if to chase away her disqui-&#xD;
etude, and breathe over each the holy calm emanat-&#xD;
ing from it's own bosom. Rosalind gazed at it for&#xD;
some moments in silence, apparently unconscious of&#xD;
the still more earnest gaze fi~eci upon her by the&#xD;
soft, loving eyes of Ernest, whose soul-lit radiance&#xD;
testified of a joy too deep for utterance, as they read&#xD;
in that young, thoughtful faco the traces of a kin~&#xD;
dred sorrow which had bound thejr two souls in one,&#xD;
and sanctified their love by the couscioushess that it&#xD;
* ~ was no dream of butterfly existence, but a sober&#xD;
reality in which trials were to be m~t and endured,&#xD;
; as well as blessings shared and enjoyed.&#xD;
"A faithful watch the moon and stars keep over&#xD;
each other,." said she, playfully.&#xD;
"As faithful as you and I will be to God, and to&#xD;
' each other?"&#xD;
" Oh Ernest, how dare you trust me?"&#xD;
"Trust you, Rosalind? I have always trusted you,&#xD;
and I always shall!"&#xD;

Each with its gay and busy interest;&#xD;
And then I muse upon their lot, and read&#xD;
~Iany a lesson in their changeful cast;&#xD;
And so grow kind of heart, as if the sight&#xD;
Of human beings were humanity."&#xD;
It was a pleasant morning in the early spring, such&#xD;
as makes one feel an irresistible longing to be out in&#xD;
the open air and enjoy the warming genial influences&#xD;
which seen'i to open our hearts to nature's kindly&#xD;
teachings as much as to penetrate and dissolve the&#xD;
icy shroud of winter.&#xD;
Amelia Crawford, who had been busily engaged&#xD;
all the week in assisting at preparations for a grand&#xD;
fete that was to come off that evening, being at leisure,&#xD;
resolved to avail herself of the privileges of the day&#xD;
and take a walk, which she always enjoyed for the&#xD;
opportunity it afforded her to come in contact with&#xD;
the busy crowd that thronged the streets, in whom&#xD;
she took a lively iiitere~t, though apparently so iuac-&#xD;
cessible to human susceptibility  She stepped into a&#xD;
store where she was acquainted, in one of the prin-&#xD;
cipal thoroughfares of the city; and stood for some&#xD;
time at the window watching the passers by, an inter-&#xD;
esting amusement, and one ~vhich furnishes many&#xD;

of his harml6~s play by the bustling man of business,&#xD;
little dreams of the ruder thrusts that await his moral&#xD;
as well as his physical man in this work-day world of&#xD;
ours, when something sterner and more practical&#xD;
than a few childish tears must come to his relief.&#xD;
Age, leaning on its staff, looking down the narrow&#xD;
path which, ere long will close entirely to its foot-&#xD;
steps, is fortunate indeed, if occasionally, one of the&#xD;
busy throng vouchsafes a kindly smile in recognition&#xD;
of its kindred nature.&#xD;
There in the middle of the muddy street stands a&#xD;
girl, fourteen perhaps, fighting her way against a&#xD;
troop of boys who wantonly upset her basket con~&#xD;
taming a few nondescript articles, one of which she&#xD;
quickly seizes and hurries out of sight, while they&#xD;
hoot after her with the cry of "thief," whether with&#xD;
just cause or not no one asks or cares to know.&#xD;
Amelia watches her, with a half resolution to inter-&#xD;
cede in her behalf, or plead with her to tell the truth&#xD;
in the matter; but while debating within herself and&#xD;
halting at the door, she loses sight of the gil~l, and&#xD;
stands there regretting her own want of decision in&#xD;
not seizing that opportunity for affecting some good,&#xD;
thus perhaps, missing the slender thread on which&#xD;
hangs the reputation of many an individual whose&#xD;
name might never have been remembered; but for&#xD;
some trivial occurrence which first opened the way&#xD;
for other deeds which have won the gratitude and&#xD;
admiration of the human race.&#xD;

&#xD;
In a few moments she was roused from her reverie&#xD;
by a smile of recogtiition from Ernest Livingston,&#xD;
and directly behind him followed' Grace Blanche,&#xD;
who gave her ~no friendly greeting,, although she&#xD;
worked for her only .tho day before. Her mind was&#xD;
too much occupied with the figure before her, in the&#xD;
line of which she kept such an even balance, that,&#xD;
turning his head on either side, he would miss a&#xD;
glimpse of her. Imagination had been too busy at&#xD;
work during those several months for conscience or&#xD;
reason to act calmly or wisely; and if she~ had not&#xD;
intended to harbor any unkind feeling towards him,,&#xD;
it would have been impossible for her to deny truth-&#xD;
fully the existence of a little revengeful spirit that&#xD;
day.&#xD;
It is said that woman is less forgiving than man,&#xD;
doubtless owing to her greater power of endurance,&#xD;
and to her more secluded life. Contact with the&#xD;
world leads to a~ study of himan nature; which dif..&#xD;
fuses a more catholic spirit as we learn-to compre-&#xD;
hend it in its many phases, and overlook what seems&#xD;
~t the moment inexplicable, confident that a knowl-&#xD;
edge of all the circumstances would materially change&#xD;
the aspect of affairs. Then Grace Blanche had met&#xD;
with no affliction since she was old eiiough to realize&#xD;
it, a school more powerful than any other to soften&#xD;
the feelings and educate them into a magnanimity&#xD;
that cannot afford to notice trifles. But this was not&#xD;
a trifle. Disappointed as she had been in the confi-&#xD;
dence placed in another, the ~ffect of which made&#xD;
her a little inclined to think the whole 'world false,&#xD;
it wa~ no light thing that this friend in whom she&#xD;
&#xD;
ii&#xD;
&#xD;
CONNECTICUT.&#xD;
&#xD;
trusted should treat her with coldness at the very&#xD;
moment she most needed sympathy. It was a most&#xD;
unfortunate thing for her that Mr. Livingston should&#xD;
have been called away at that time, since, had they&#xD;
met as usual afterwards, this little incident might&#xD;
have been forgotten.&#xD;
On his return, her reserve excited no less surprise&#xD;
and regret on his part. His affections were intense-&#xD;
ly strong as his unwavering attachment to R~salind&#xD;
proved, and the thought of this friendship being&#xD;
broken, pained him deeply. Again and again he&#xD;
vi~ied to approach her with his wanted familiarity&#xD;
and was as often repulsed.&#xD;
In the meantime Mr. Carleton improved his oppor-.&#xD;
tunity to regain the esteem he feared h~d been&#xD;
lowered through Mr. Livingston's influence. Keep-&#xD;
ing himself well informed of the movements of th~&#xD;
latter, his absence was known to him sooner than to&#xD;
most of his friends, but it was sometime before he&#xD;
~uccecded in ingratiating himself into her favor&#xD;
sufficiently to be on intimate terms as a friend. Miss&#xD;
Blanche never lost faith in Mr. Livingston's integri-&#xD;
ty which made hoP hesitate long, before surrender-&#xD;
ing herself again to the fascinating influence of Mr.&#xD;
Carleton. There was an irresistible desire to cling&#xD;
to something, and in desperation she yielded.&#xD;
Never oculd a perso~i show more tenderness and&#xD;
devotion than he, being capable of' the most exalted&#xD;
emotions, though transient. rfhlere xvere gleams of&#xD;
a better nature rising within i him, acted upon by the&#xD;
transcendent qualities of this pure and noble woman,&#xD;
which doubtless lessened her confidence in Mr. Liv-&#xD;

&#xD;
ingstdn's impression of his character, and made her&#xD;
feel a little disposed to reproach him for it.&#xD;
In the autumn previous, Mr. Carleton was taken&#xD;
\ sick, and for many weeks his life was despaired of.&#xD;
Though not his constant attendant, Miss Blanche&#xD;
was often by his bedside, and the attachment before&#xD;
existing was greatly strengthened. As he grew&#xD;
weaker, the higher elements of his nature were&#xD;
developed while the passions lay dormant, and even&#xD;
his foes yielded to the conviction that a change must&#xD;
have takeii place which would transform him into a&#xD;
different character if his life should be spared. When&#xD;
able to talk, his fascil4ating gift of conversation shone&#xD;
forth with greater brilliance than ever. As the&#xD;
disease began to abate, the physician recommended&#xD;
a winter residence at the Southas the only m&amp;amp;ans of&#xD;
fully restoring his impaired health, which brought.&#xD;
to his side many of his former friends, eager to efface&#xD;
any disagreeable record they might have left of wan-&#xD;
ing friendship. Among this number Ernest Livings-&#xD;
ton did not appear, there being no occasion for it.&#xD;
He had never borne any malice toward the man,&#xD;
neither had ho ever honored him with his friendship.&#xD;
This was sufficient to convince Urace Blanche that&#xD;
he had not changed his opinions concerning him.1&#xD;
Mr. Carleton left for the South as soon as he was&#xD;
ablekeeping up a correspondence with her through&#xD;
the winter, yet nothing had ever been said of mar-&#xD;
riage. Doubts still existed in her mind, of the pro-&#xD;
priety of her couVse, the responsibility of which she&#xD;
cast upon him who had' it in his power to have pre-&#xD;
vented it if he had. not forsaken her in the hour of&#xD;
&#xD;
trial. This reflection preyed upon her more than usual&#xD;
the day of the great party, which gave rise to her&#xD;
excited feelings towards him then. She was playing&#xD;
onthe piano when Ernest and Rosalind arrived that&#xD;
evening, the latter having been detained by company&#xD;
which made them late. 1~4Ir. Livingston was exceed-&#xD;
ingly fond of music, in which accomplishment Miss&#xD;
Blanche excelled, and she was performing the same&#xD;
difficult but exquisite part that won his admiration&#xD;
the first time he ever saw her. Could it be that she&#xD;
harbored an ~nnkind feeling toward any human being,&#xD;
and especially ~toward him who had given her no&#xD;
cause of offence, thought Mr. Livingston, as the&#xD;
sound floated upward, making him feel that he could&#xD;
foi~give the greatest personal injury ever committed&#xD;
by a human being. Probably ndt many among that&#xD;
brilliant throng would have shrunk from the same,&#xD;
acknowledgment, listening as they were with the&#xD;
most intense enthusiasm to this melodious inspira-&#xD;
tion, scarcely knowing which were most fascinating,&#xD;
the thrilling notes of the music or the beauty and&#xD;
gracefulness of the player, enhanced now by the&#xD;
fervor of soul thrown into, the performance.&#xD;
He resolved to make another attempt, and speak&#xD;
to her as if nothing had happened when she rose&#xD;
from the piano, not doubting that amid the crowd&#xD;
of people and the exalting influences of the moment&#xD;
she would, like himself, banish all former distrust,&#xD;
and treat him at least courteously. But he mis-&#xD;
calculated that time.&#xD;
She experienced the opposite sensation. She&#xD;
knew when he entered, knew where he was standing,&#xD;

and felt that he was listening to her admiringly,&#xD;
which fact contributed not a little to throw more&#xD;
spirit and ferVor of soul into her performance. Its&#xD;
intimate association with their first meeting, brought&#xD;
to mind all the disagreeable incidents of the broken&#xD;
links of a once warm and generous friendship, which&#xD;
roused a greater alienation of feeling than before.&#xD;
3he swept proudly by him, not so much as deigning&#xD;
f1       ~o give him a look of condescension, displaying with&#xD;
uch coi;scious intention as to arrest the attention&#xD;
&amp;amp; all eyes, which followed her as she rose. Rosa-&#xD;
~ind looked wonderingly from her to Ernest, and&#xD;
from him to her. She saw an expression in his eyes&#xD;
which she never saw before, nor ever after. Hitherto,&#xD;
he had felt grieved, but not vexed. When his indig-&#xD;
ation was excited it was n~t easily quelled, until&#xD;
determined to know in this instance, having been&#xD;
cause was removed, if any existed, which he was&#xD;
embarrassed by her enough, let it be what it mio~ht&#xD;
and therefore resolved to seek the first opportunity&#xD;
I&#xD;
to demand an explanation. He did not have to wait&#xD;
long. Evidently unhappy, the admiration she had&#xD;
excited was uncongenial t~ her feelings, and she&#xD;
stepped aside into a conservatory whither he fob&#xD;
lowed her.&#xD;
"Good evening Miss Blanche," said he, qs he ex-&#xD;
tended his hand, "I believe 'you did not recognize&#xD;
me as yowpassed by me."&#xD;
ConventionM in all her ways, she was surprised&#xD;
by this unexpected sally from one as conventional&#xD;
as herself. Mechanically giving him her hand, her&#xD;
eyes dropped, being too confused to reply.&#xD;

Never did ~he look more charming in her queen-&#xD;
ly beauty, than when that delicate, rose-tinted blush&#xD;
rayed a momentary lack of the self possession&#xD;
which seldom deserted her in any emergency. It&#xD;
was pleasant to feel the pressure of his hand once&#xD;
more, but what was to be done next? There they&#xD;
stood, liable at any moment to be surprised and em-&#xD;
barrassed by others. He had not studied his lesson&#xD;
beforehand, and probably by this time was wishing&#xD;
himself out of the dilemma he had so unceremoni-&#xD;
ous:y rushed into. He let go her hand, and she&#xD;
looked up 'at him with a half smile, in her usual&#xD;
dignified manner. He smiled the' smile she had&#xD;
once so much enjoyed. All bitterness melted away&#xD;
in an instant, and it is not' known what explanation&#xD;
might have followed, bat for the sudden aniiounce-&#xD;
ment of Mr. Carleton which was as unexpected to'&#xD;
her,' as to the rest of the company. She turned&#xD;
deadly pale, and the interview was abruptly termin-&#xD;
ated.&#xD;
She did not leave the conservatory for some time,&#xD;
remaining unobserved as she supposed, amid the&#xD;
dense mass of flowers and shrubbery, which gave it&#xD;
the character of an artificial garden. There she&#xD;
was struggling with the contending emotions of her&#xD;
soul, haviftg just beo'un t6 tread that delicate laby-&#xD;
rinth whose intricate findings would disclose a mine&#xD;
to fathom which; the brief space of twenty years had&#xD;
not given her the first sounding plummet. She was&#xD;

he was restQred to her confidence, while his repul-.&#xD;
sion to Mr. Carleton was as sensibly communicated&#xD;
to her as if the latter had openly avowed himself in.&#xD;
her presence the arrant hypocrite the former assum-&#xD;
ed him to be. If it is true that a woman's quick&#xD;
instinct empowers her to be an unerring criterion&#xD;
of character; there are so many controlling influen-&#xD;
ces to modify it, unknown to herself, that it seldom&#xD;
acts with full force.&#xD;
"What hastened you back so soon, Mr. Carleton?"&#xD;
said one of his friends, as they stood near the door&#xD;
of the conservatory, through which his observant&#xD;
eyes detected the object of his search ever since he&#xD;
entered the parlors.&#xD;
"A little item of business, in fact a powerful mag-&#xD;
net has attracted me here," said he with a signifi-&#xD;
cant wink, in a voice too loW to be understood by&#xD;
Miss Blanche although the sound of his voice was&#xD;
instantly recognized by her. An involuntary shud-&#xD;
der crept over her as she looked round for a chance&#xD;
of escape, and the next moment saw ~iim advancing&#xD;
towards her.~&#xD;
"Why Miss Blanche, what is the matter, you are&#xD;
ill! " exclaimed he as he felt the icy touch of her&#xD;
hand, and 6bserved her deathly pallor, at the same&#xD;
time throwing his arm around her to lead her to&#xD;
the open air. This act sent the blood coursing&#xD;
through her temples ~nd restored her self possession.&#xD;
Remembering where she was, and how long she had&#xD;
been absent from the company, by a strong effort&#xD;
she, succeeded in throwing a mask over her feelings&#xD;
so as to attract no attention during the rest of the&#xD;
&#xD;
ening, except from Ernest Livingston, by whom&#xD;
she felt she Was closely observed. Mr. Carleton did&#xD;
not leave her for an instant, although she tried in&#xD;
vaiii to assure him that she was not ill, hoping that&#xD;
lie would leave her to herself.&#xD;
"Those flowers," said lie, "have delightful odors,&#xD;
but do you know that the fragrance of flowers in a&#xD;
close room is thought by some to be poisonous?&#xD;
(     That may have been the cause of your slight illness.&#xD;
If you will go with me to the sunny south," said he&#xD;
lowering his tone, and assuming his peculiar musi-&#xD;
cal inflection of voice, "we can enjoy the beauty of&#xD;
flowers such as you never saw here, without suffer~&#xD;
mg from their poisonous exhalations, as no hot-bed&#xD;
culture is needed there. And do you know that&#xD;
there is a wide field of usefulness for every woman&#xD;
who would employ most beneficently that higher&#xD;
order of talents With which God has endowed her,&#xD;
that she should beautify this world with noble works&#xD;
even as he has adorned it with flowers."&#xD;
The sireii voice had penetrated her soul. She&#xD;
looked up at him. What a beautiful light shone in&#xD;
his eyes! Oh, deceitful world!&#xD;

A TALE OF THE&#xD;

That day, at least, has been one of tranquillity, one&#xD;
of calm, placid content, when she was willing to live&#xD;
in the present, and asked for nothing more.&#xD;
Thank God for such days, for the rest they bring!&#xD;
and yet how soon we weary of them. Work, work&#xD;
for both mind and body, is what we crave, and none&#xD;
can be truly happy without it ,-these little intervals&#xD;
arq but preludes to a mightier effort.&#xD;
Amelia ~lreamedf going to a wedding where she&#xD;
was to iheet her mother, and after waiting and&#xD;
searching for heir until the guests were nearly' gone,&#xD;
learned that she had bug since left in a carriage,&#xD;
leaving her to follow on foot. The disappointment&#xD;
awoke her when she found that mother she had&#xD;
none, with weddings she had nothing to do, and the&#xD;
disagreeable sensation of toiling on foot roused her&#xD;
to a consciousness bf labor to be performed before&#xD;
she would be permitted to go to lici' mother. So she&#xD;
slept no more tl;at night, and lays restl~ssl~~ and&#xD;
anxiously devising ~ some scheme that should satisfy&#xD;
the demands of what some call conscience, others the&#xD;
development of o r own nature, while the nimble&#xD;
feet of the merry dancers iii yonder mansion still&#xD;
kept time with the merrier mdsic. There were those&#xD;
present who could sympathize with Amelia, those for&#xD;
whom the festivities of the hour had no ci arm, serv-&#xD;
ing merely as safety valves to let off some of the pres-&#xD;
sure preying upon them in their luxurious homes.&#xD;
Morning came at length when she must be up and&#xD;
doing, for this was 'to be a day Qf weariness and toil,&#xD;
doubly wearisome because the labor of her hands&#xD;
would be in such striking contrast with the current&#xD;
&#xD;
CONNECTICUT.              219&#xD;
of her thoughts. Her service was engaged to a lady&#xD;
who was neither a Grace Blanche, nor a Rosalind&#xD;
Claremont, but a person whose primordial existence&#xD;
reminded one of the latest fashion-plate. Doubtless&#xD;
sh~ had her moments of aspiration after something&#xD;
gher, if any one was fortunate enough to detect&#xD;
them beneath the apparent heartlessness and shallow&#xD;
perceptions that the in~st su erficial aims and worth-&#xD;
less education coRld dovelopi 1-low she might excel&#xD;
in dress was her paramount study, and this clay had&#xD;
been selected for service in that department that she&#xD;
might avail herself of the great fashion emporium ~f&#xD;
the previous evening. The nervous exhaustion re-&#xD;
sulting from th~ excitement of that night, including&#xD;
some real or fancied slight from one whose flattering&#xD;
attentions she was particularly anxious to gain, made&#xD;
her uimusually hard to please ; and Amelia, indiffer-&#xD;
ent as she generally was, to praise or the lack of it,&#xD;
began to feel impatient at the total want of apprecia*&#xD;
tion of her best endeavors to give satisfaction.&#xD;
She was not the one to be pitied, however, for&#xD;
more harrowing sensations, more torturing anxieties,&#xD;
greater restlessness and weariness thah she ever&#xD;
know, tinctured the existence of this votary of fashion&#xD;
and pleasure. No sxveet slumber came to her pillow&#xD;
as the blessed reward of wholesome toil, or the con-&#xD;
sciousness of making a single effort to make others&#xD;
happy. But judge her not harshly. Too many but-&#xD;
terflies still flit in our pathway, who, like the transient&#xD;

occur in which we are surprised at the strength of&#xD;
character and energy of will displayed by this same&#xD;
class when the illusions of youth have lost their&#xD;
charms, 'and a false education has exhausted its&#xD;
frivolities.&#xD;
A great injury has been done to woman, for which&#xD;
she is not alone responsible, in cramping her intellect&#xD;
just at the period it is most active, when the excite-&#xD;
ment of school-life passes away, and she needs some-&#xD;
thing to satisfy the insatiate craving of that most&#xD;
wonderful mechanism, the human mind. The atten-&#xD;
tion of many deep thinkers has been turned ti this&#xD;
point, and hence volumes of homilies by both sexes&#xD;
upon the duties and employment of unmarried wo-&#xD;
omen. Why should they not be written for unmarried&#xD;
men as well? Because society allows them to mark&#xD;
out a sphere for themselves. A man will always&#xD;
find. enough to occupy his mind after completi~v~ the&#xD;
established routine of education, without hurrying&#xD;
into a premature marriage as a woman often does,&#xD;
to escape this oppressive blank in her existence.&#xD;
Aspiration is immortal, and. every act which tends to&#xD;
silence it dwarfs the divine nature, and embitters&#xD;
the human.&#xD;
rrliere are crises in life from xvhich few are exempt,&#xD;
when our only safety lies in a great overwhelming&#xD;
impulse, that shall draw us aside from the trouble&#xD;
draining the heart's life-blood, into some active chan-&#xD;
nel where self is forgotten in the measure of respon-&#xD;
sibilities, which, in our disposal of them, lift us into&#xD;
that eternal future where our influence shall mould&#xD;
the ages, but in which we, as individuals, are but&#xD;

faculties of the soul, overpowering with their compre-&#xD;
hensive sublimity petty trials of transient duration,&#xD;
in that exercise of faith and hope which carry us&#xD;
forward to those higher conceptions of the great pur-&#xD;
pose for which life was created, as impossible to~ gain&#xD;
in lWcs of frivolity and ease, as t6 be ignored in the&#xD;

whose life is as pure as a cotton ball before it is cursed&#xD;
by slave labor, for hang it Jim, since I went north&#xD;
I believe slave labor is accursed. Say, will you bet?"&#xD;
"Bet? yes, I'll bet you that thousand dollars I've&#xD;
just won, and have it drawn up in writing. But a&#xD;
man of your character will never get a yankee girl&#xD;
of that stamp. They are too shrewd. You don't&#xD;
know 'em as I do. You judge 'em by the character&#xD;
of our southern women which may be lMl~C enough&#xD;
for anything I know, but by thunder they'd all have&#xD;
to live old maids if they should be as particular as&#xD;
they are up north. I'd as soon live in a straight&#xD;

One of the characters in the preceding pages will&#xD;
be readily recognized as Mr. Carleton who had lost&#xD;
heavily in a gambling operation with a fellow rogue&#xD;
in broadcloth. Both of them had too much of the&#xD;
northern element of refinement in th6ir natures to&#xD;
mingle promiscuously with southern society, and the&#xD;
Yank~e born was not yet so lost to the early teach-&#xD;
ings of his childhood as to yield unscrupulously to&#xD;
the worst princiDles of southern depravity. The&#xD;
other, judged by his early education, was not aiiy&#xD;
lower in the scale of morality. There is scarcely a&#xD;
man so depraved that he has not a redeeming trait&#xD;
somewhere, through which he feels instinctively a&#xD;
certain degree of reverence for a noble and virtuous&#xD;
woman. While one scrupled at the thought of vio-&#xD;
lating what was left 6f his dim perceptions of honor,&#xD;
the other justified himself by indulging that spark&#xD;
of manly feeling which really glowed in his bosom at&#xD;
the thought that he might win the love of sq pure a&#xD;
being, which ought to refute the charge his frie iid&#xD;
brought against his character, and which had really&#xD;
incensed him to persevere.&#xD;
The result was his sudden exit, and his' sudden&#xD;
appearance ofl the evening alluded to. After leaving&#xD;
home, when his anger had time to cool, and reason&#xD;
to return, so many doubts arose in his mind about&#xD;
being able to accomplish his purpose within the time&#xD;
specified, if at all, that he lost no spare moments in&#xD;

his blandishments and reasonable in his propositions,&#xD;
the innocent heart' was beguiled and the first day of&#xD;
June was appointed to celebrate their nuptials. He&#xD;
would gladly have hastened it sooner, but yielding to&#xD;
her feelings of regret at the thoughts of leaving her&#xD;
northern home, he deferred it as long as possible,&#xD;
and really acted honestly in doing so. There was&#xD;
an irresistible charm about him when he gave full&#xD;
play to his higher nature that would justify the con-&#xD;
fidence of as pure~minded a woman as Grace Blanche.&#xD;
She tried. hard to forget that any cause evdr existed&#xD;
to doubt hi~ sincerity, but since the night she received&#xD;
Mr. Livingston back to her friendship, she felt the&#xD;
strength of his former influence. They met seldom&#xD;
now, and he never mentioned the subject, feeling&#xD;
that it was' too late, He could only hope that a re-&#xD;
formation had taken place, and sh~ might be happy&#xD;
in her new relation. It was a source of regret that&#xD;
she was to leave the city, but southern corruption&#xD;
had not been so fully revealed then as now, and' no&#xD;
one thought of raising that question as an objection&#xD;
to her departure, either in relation to her happiness&#xD;
or his depoi4ment. Tier numerous friends sent their&#xD;
congratulations, past rumors were forgotten, and all&#xD;
seemed to go merrily as marriage bell, save that&#xD;
leaden weight at her heart.&#xD;
The bloom faded from her cheek, but elicited no&#xD;
comment. The . wedding day came, the ceremony&#xD;
was performed, and the bridal couple were cheered&#xD;
with all t~ie good wishes it was possible for loving&#xD;
friends to shower upon them. Ernest Livingston&#xD;

"Who, looking backward from his manhood's prime,&#xD;
Sees not the spectre of his misspent time;.&#xD;
And through the shade&#xD;
Of funeral cypress, planted thick behind,&#xD;
Hears no reproachful whisper on the wind&#xD;
* From the loved dead!"&#xD;
&#xD;
The first year of Walter's college life drew to a&#xD;
close, and Rosalind was full of joyous anticipations,&#xD;
laying-every plan with reference to his return, and&#xD;
neglecting no means her imagination could suggest&#xD;
to enhance the pleasure of his visit with agreeable&#xD;
surprises. Her mother and Ernest were equally&#xD;
joyful, but her enthusiasm cast their's into the shade.&#xD;
If they started a new idea, she was sure to add some-&#xD;
thing to it which would increase the interest of the&#xD;
.occasion. Ernest was very cager to add one, to the&#xD;
list of her surprises, in which she could have no shard&#xD;
being as much of a surprise to her as "to Walter, if&#xD;
he could do it without at the same time giving her&#xD;
pain.&#xD;
This was the presentation of her picture which&#xD;
had long been finished, and carefully veiled from aill&#xD;
eyes except his own. She was so sensitive to the&#xD;
most indirect allusion to 'that unhappy occurrence&#xD;
between them, that he had not even ventured to&#xD;
give her any pond lilies.&#xD;

the greatest kindness ~ovards her would be to help&#xD;
her overcome this needless shrinking from recur~&#xD;
rence to an event which was not worth a painful&#xD;
thought, and which had long since lost eve~'y pain~&#xD;
ful association. lie gathered some lilies, of which&#xD;
a few yet remained, and presented them to hOr the&#xD;
day before Walter's return. Notwithstanding an&#xD;
effort to appear grateful for them, an expression of&#xD;
pain flitted over her features.&#xD;
"Rosalind," said Ernest in a serious tone,' "why&#xD;
should those lilies, or any reminiscence of lasts sum~&#xD;
mer' s experience cause you or me an unpleasant&#xD;
sensation? Do you think you are alone in nced~&#xD;
lessly disturbing your own peace by a thoughtless&#xD;
act? If so, he who now stands before you can relate&#xD;
a personal experience as much more painful than&#xD;
yours as it' is more impossible to retrieve an error&#xD;
With thb dead than with the living."&#xD;
Startled from ~her motionless attitude, the lilies&#xD;
dropped from her hands upon the table, and she&#xD;
gave him a look of surprise, saying, "You, Ernest ?"&#xD;
~' Yes. I had a mother once, as kind, as devoted&#xD;
as yours, and I loved her as intensely as a child could&#xD;
love a parent, ~vhich she returned by treating me as a&#xD;
companion, rather than as a son over whom she might&#xD;
exercise a parent's control. Our' lives in. this matter&#xD;
very much resembled yours here, and perhaps my&#xD;
youth wa~ as blameless as' Walter's. My mother's&#xD;
health was always delicate,, though never such as to&#xD;
excite alarm. I never left her until II went to college.&#xD;
I know now the struggle it' must have cost her to&#xD;
part with me, but I did not realize, it then. As full&#xD;

of joyous anticipations as Walter at the thought of&#xD;
~the new paths of science I was about to tread, I&#xD;
scarcely cast a lingering regret behind rae, and she&#xD;
summoned her fortitude to bid me a cheerful good&#xD;
bye, saying it was needless to caution' me against&#xD;
fal1in~ into bad habits, a compliment of which It was&#xD;
justly proud. Then she -wrote me such beautiful&#xD;
letters which I always answered promptly. Before&#xD;
I was aware, the temptations of college life were&#xD;
undermining my fixed principles of conduct, and&#xD;
in a thoughtless moment I yielded to importunities&#xD;
to which once I would not have thought of listening.&#xD;
Convinced of my folly before really committing any-&#xD;
thing bad, had it not been for the associations con-&#xD;
4   nectQ(l with it, probably it would have left no lasting&#xD;
impression. I consented to join a party of students&#xD;
in high life, for what purpose I knew not, except that&#xD;
they were to meet for a convivial frolic, which needed&#xD;
no nice interpretation to foresee its character among&#xD;
'such a set of fellows as those who first proposed it.&#xD;
Not requested to assist in the preparations, probably&#xD;
knowing I was not sufficiently initiated for that, they&#xD;
merely asked me to be present as a guest. At first&#xD;
my conscience hesitated a hittl~, but it soon became&#xD;
quieted with the reflection that there was no neces-&#xD;
sity to set myself above others who were to be pres~&#xD;
ent, the sons of clergymen and professional men of&#xD;
th~ highest re~pectabihity in the land, not thinking&#xD;
that perhaps they were taking their first lessons in&#xD;
the downward career of vice. I cannot imagine&#xD;

tion, and every principle of correct habits and a&#xD;
refiuied taste. Being unaccustomed to such scenes&#xD;
I must have been dazzled, bewildered at what I saw,&#xD;
and the congratulationis I heard passing from lip to&#xD;
lip that IL was one of their number. how they ever&#xD;
managed so secretly gs to carry out their plan 'suc~&#xD;
cessfully without being detected, has always been a&#xD;
mystery. Making no secret of it among themselves,&#xD;
as the champagne was freely passed around the circle&#xD;
the toast to one and another of the Faculty was&#xD;
drunk, boasting of the delicious fowls their granaries&#xD;
had contributed to their bacchanalian feast, and&#xD;
exulting over the depletion of the kitchen larder.&#xD;
suddenly, as vividly as if she had stood there before&#xD;
me to utter them, the last words of my n'iother when&#xD;
standi~ig in the doorway to give me her parting bene~&#xD;
diction occurred to my mind. 'There is no need to&#xD;
caution you against falling into bad habits,'&#xD;
"I rose instantly from the table, leaving the meal&#xD;
untasted, and hastened to my room. The sudden-&#xD;
ness of' my departure' pi~obably stupitied their won-&#xD;
der as they made no effort to detain me, or seek an&#xD;
explanation. There IL found a letter written in a&#xD;
strange hand, announcing the sudden illness of my&#xD;
mother, who do sired my presence immediately. The&#xD;
anxiety of that night and the upbraidings of con-&#xD;
science I will not attempt to describe. To go from.&#xD;
such a debasing scene as I had just left, to the death&#xD;
bed of my beloved mother, seemed like tainting the&#xD;
pure aix of heaven with the malarious exhalations of&#xD;

some noxious pit. Then I recollected my neglect&#xD;
in answering her last letter, the first instance of the&#xD;
kind. Why it was I could not tell, but as if a&#xD;
lightning flash had come from heaven to reveal me&#xD;
unt;o myself, I saw at once how the excitements of&#xD;
my new life were fast blunting the acute perceptions&#xD;
of my moral natur'~ and how rapidly, yet uncon~&#xD;
sciously, my conscience was becoming seared. The&#xD;
next morning as soon as I could obtain conveyance,&#xD;
I started for home, arriving at nightfall, but i~ot&#xD;
until the vital spark had fl.6d. All day I had been&#xD;
revolving the question in my mind how I should&#xD;
meet her with that sense of guilt on my &amp;amp;oiil ;&#xD;
whether to confess it or spare her last hours the pain&#xD;
of that disclosure. Facing my sin alone in that&#xD;
chamber of death, what would I not have given for&#xD;
one short hour to pour into her ears the tale of n~y&#xD;
contrition, and hear from her lips tho sweet words&#xD;
qf forgiveness. No such comfort remained. No&#xD;
I~iore loving words of hers would ever again bring&#xD;
sunlight to my soul, and henceforth, through the&#xD;
stormy waves that had come thus early to buffet me,&#xD;
no beacon smile of joy would lead inc in triumph,&#xD;
nor tender admonition warn mc of danger. I now&#xD;
thought I could not live. The loss of my mother&#xD;
alone seemed too hard to bear, and the addition of&#xD;
this terrible burden of remorse seemed hell itself.&#xD;
For months I wandered in my restless agony with~&#xD;
out being lilAc to fix my mind on any kind of busi..&#xD;
ness, or particiPate in any pleasure. Abandoniiw&#xD;
all thoughts of completing my collegiate course, IL&#xD;

curiosities, and if possible, divert my. attention from&#xD;
such useless regrets. While there I visited a studio&#xD;
of one of the most eminent Italian artists, where a&#xD;
painting of extraordinary excellence riveted my gaze.&#xD;
Such exquisite coloring and perfect representation of&#xD;
natural beauty, such life-like delineation of human&#xD;
character I never before observed. There were&#xD;
several groups in the picture, each representing differ-&#xD;
cut pliases.of~ life, one of which particularly attracted&#xD;
me, which I still remember as if it were but yester-&#xD;
day. An old lady sat bonneted and shaxvled in the&#xD;
corner, with spectacles resting ow the tip of her nose;&#xD;
watching with concealed merriment a group of young&#xD;
persons who were trying to manage something&#xD;
they did not. understand ci, and evidently wishing her&#xD;
out of the way. The scornful ~xl4ression of their&#xD;
lips as they glanced backward tu see if she were&#xD;
looking at them, and their uneasy glances at each&#xD;
other showed as plainly as words could express,&#xD;
that they knew she c~ uld give them all the informa-&#xD;
tion desired, the thought of receiving which from&#xD;
her they spurned. riji~ scene was evidently intend-&#xD;
ed to represent the o~d adage, "Young folks think&#xD;
old folks are fo~Is, and old folks know young ones&#xD;
are," which was most clearly illustrated in the chuck-&#xD;
ling expro~sion of the old lady's face. Though out&#xD;
of keeping with the current of my thoughts, it sug-&#xD;
ge~ted to me the idea, "Why not be. an artist?"&#xD;
What a~ thrill went through me at that mdmnent!&#xD;
It seemed like a monitor from heaven sent to calm&#xD;
my troubled soul by leading it to that eternal sense&#xD;
of Beauty which is the source of all inspiration,&#xD;

forming an indi~oluble bond between man and his&#xD;
Creator; as it is through it the divine perceptions&#xD;
are shadowed forth in visible types of the Infinite,&#xD;
and recognized by a corresponding artistic combina-&#xD;
tion of the immortal attributes of the human soul.&#xD;
I immediately engaged myself as a pupil nuder the&#xD;
instruction of one of the most celebrated masters,&#xD;
and succeeded beyond my most sanguine expecta-&#xD;
tions. After sufficient practice, I undertook a sketch&#xD;
of my mother from memory. I was advised not to&#xD;
make the attempt as it would probably prove a fail-&#xD;
ure and dampen my ardor. But my soul was alive&#xD;
with the idQa, and nothing could deter it. Here&#xD;
my anticipations were also realized, and the result&#xD;
was a most perfect representation of' her features&#xD;
and expression. Even the eyes beamed with the&#xD;
serene radiance of faith and hope which constituted&#xD;
such a beautiful feature of her daily life. That pic-&#xD;
ture has ever since been my guiding star to lead me&#xD;
to a higher life. In it I read the sweet words of&#xD;
forgiveness so much desired, and the loving spirit of&#xD;
charity needed to make me lenient toward the faults&#xD;
of erring humanity. Formerly I had been too exact-&#xD;
ing, holding others to the rigid standard I proposed&#xD;
to myself, and expected to carry out, which is well&#xD;
if done in the right spirit. .~s I found in my own&#xD;
experience, no person knows his own power to with-&#xD;
stand surrounding influences until exposed to the&#xD;
temptation. That mercy we ask for ourselves we&#xD;
nrnst show unto others, and judge them by their&#xD;
different temperaments and comparative education&#xD;

just before I formed your acquaintance, and th~ rest&#xD;

hot only for the relief it brings, to make another the&#xD;

how little we know of the faults of the wisest and&#xD;

how our errors as well as our virtues, may be the&#xD;
stepping-stone to a higher order of perfeefion."&#xD;
The sympathy excited in Rosalind by this narra~&#xD;
tion imparted an unwanted degree of tenderness&#xD;
which shone in ovory act and word through the day.&#xD;
The admiration before felt for Ernest was increased&#xD;
to unbounded reverence, feeling the force of his im-&#xD;
plied admonition to reconcile her to herself and the&#xD;
world. A new expresSIon appeared on her counto-&#xD;

phetic of life's great purpose.&#xD;
This inhised more of seriousness in Walter's re-&#xD;
ception, thaim she had a~~ticil)ated, but not in such a&#xD;
manner as to impair the enjoyment of the occasion,&#xD;
rather enhancing its interest. When the other sur-&#xD;
prises were over, Ernest improved a favorable oppor-&#xD;
tunity to bring on his.&#xD;
Walter and Rosalind were quietly chatting together&#xD;
on the sofa after tea, when he entered with a picture&#xD;
which lie handed to Walter, saying, "Here is a&#xD;
&#xD;
CONNECTICUT.              235&#xD;
present for Rosalind which is inteiiclcd to surprise&#xD;
you both." Turning to her he said, "Let no uu~&#xD;
pleasant associations cQnne(~ted with it disturb you,&#xD;
for I want you to cherish it as I do, aniohg the&#xD;
sweetest memories of life. If it shall remind us of&#xD;
suffering let us remember that it is through suffering~&#xD;
the soul reveals her noblest gifts."&#xD;
Walter unveiled the picture, and j u~nped up with&#xD;
a joyful exclamation of surprise, holding it before&#xD;
the astonished eyes of Rosalind which were soon suf-&#xD;
fuscd with tears at this unexpected feature of the&#xD;
programme. Quickly suppressing them, she arose&#xD;
without speaking and approached Ernest, throwing&#xD;
her arms around his neck and kissing him in such a&#xD;
natural, child-like manner as to bring fresh to mind&#xD;
the memory of those happy days when the child and&#xD;
the father walked together in such close and loving&#xD;
companionship, not without their trials, yet blessed&#xD;
in the end.&#xD;
Walter's buoyant spirit was yet unclouded by&#xD;
trials. Affectionate and deferential as when a child,&#xD;
he exhibited a self reliance which sought no out~ido&#xD;
guidance, yet so gentle and submissive in i~s nature&#xD;
that it sought instinctively the protcct~ng paiioply of&#xD;
a mother's blessing. The moral firmness of his&#xD;
character snone conspicuously amid the temptations&#xD;
V      of his new life, never for a moment swerving from&#xD;
the path of duty. Even the most reckless and un-&#xD;
principled of his classmates loved and honored him&#xD;
for his genial temper, frankness of manners, and&#xD;
the resolute stand he maintained in opposition to&#xD;
their habits and vices.&#xD;

Pearl by pearl the costly braid,--&#xD;
The daily thread of hopes and fears,&#xD;
Weaves up the woof of many years.~&#xD;
And well thy labors shall have sped,&#xD;
If well thou weav'st thy daily thread."&#xD;
A far more important event than anything that&#xD;
occurred at home awaited Walter's return from col-&#xD;
lege. James Morgan's year of probation drew to a&#xD;
close. Just a year from the night they had the in-&#xD;
terview, he sat down and wrote the following letter:&#xD;
"My own beloved Mary,-.--One year ago to-night&#xD;
I pledged myself before God, in the presence of Wal-&#xD;
ter Claremont, that I would never again touch the&#xD;
intoxicating cup. Through divine help and your&#xD;
influence, Mary, I have kept the pledge. You may&#xD;
call it selfish, but I never should have had the strength&#xD;
to do it if it had not been for you. Many, many&#xD;
times should I have yielded to my craving thirst, but&#xD;
for the agonizing thought of being separated from&#xD;
you forever. Mai~y, my angel guide, I will conceal&#xD;
nothing from you, so that you shall never have it&#xD;
to say that I deceived you. All my bad deeds you&#xD;
know, and my struggles against temptation will not&#xD;
certainly lower me in your eyes, especially when I&#xD;
have triumphed over them.&#xD;
One Saturday night it seemed to me I could not&#xD;
live through another Sunday without some kind of&#xD;
excitement. 'That is the hardest day I have, because&#xD;
(236)&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
~ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
it gives me the most leisure. Mr. Brewster and his&#xD;
wife with whom I board are very kind to me, and&#xD;
do every thing they can for my happiness. They*&#xD;
give me a plenty of books to read, and invite ~xie to&#xD;
share the society of all the company they have, as&#xD;
much as if I were one of the family, but what is all&#xD;
that compared with one letter to read of your hand-&#xD;
writing, Mary, or an hour spent with you? As I&#xD;
lay there thinking it over, and longing for a sight&#xD;
at you, or a talk with Walter which you know was&#xD;
impossible because h6 was away at college, it sudden-&#xD;
ly occurred to me that I would slip over to ,Briar&#xD;
Street Church where you go, the next day, and see&#xD;
if I couldn't get a glimpse of you, Mary, it would do&#xD;
me so much good. It was leaping over the bounds&#xD;
I know, and running the risk of meeting my old&#xD;
associates, some of whom go there, but God pro-&#xD;
tected me; I did not see one of them. I kept otit&#xD;
of sight until all the congregation had gone in, and&#xD;
then I went in and sat down on the back seat where&#xD;
nobody could se~ me. I could just get a sight at&#xD;
your bonnet, that pretty little white bonnet trimmed -&#xD;
with pink and white ribbon that you. know I liked so&#xD;
well, Mary. Once when you turned your head round&#xD;
I got a side glimpse of your face. Oh Mary! that&#xD;
did me more good than all the preaching of. twenty&#xD;
years against drinkiiig could have done. I felt as&#xD;
if you would not disappoint me, I knew you wouldn't;&#xD;
and when you leaned your head on your hand, I&#xD;
knew you were praying for me, and I prayed for my-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
Never did music sound so sweet before. I felt as&#xD;
if I was wafted on the wings of angels to a better&#xD;
land where all temptation was swept away, and you&#xD;
and I could b~ perfectly happy in each other's love.&#xD;
Oh my own dear Mary! I am afraid this is too much&#xD;
to think, that I shall, never be permitted to realize it.&#xD;
ii know I am not worthy of you, that a whole life-&#xD;

&#xD;
time is not enough to atone for my sins, and li could&#xD;
not blame you if-oh no, II cannot think of that.&#xD;
Do trust me, Mary.&#xD;
Never since that day have I had such a strong&#xD;
thirst; you overpowered it. My destiny is in your&#xD;
hands,-.~-you will not cast me off. I do not doubt it&#xD;
Mary, only I want it from your own lips that you&#xD;
love me still, and will now become my wife. That&#xD;
has been a blessed thought to me, and my greatest&#xD;
support. If I could keep steady by thinking of you&#xD;
how much more can I do it by being with you. Per-&#xD;
haps you will think I should have done it before, but&#xD;
you do not know how hard it is to resist, when every-&#xD;
body around me was urging me just to drink a little,&#xD;
and then I loved it so and wanted more. I did it&#xD;
without thinking what the end would be. Oh! the&#xD;
cursed viper! how it has maddened and tortured me.&#xD;
Now you will let me come and see you, won't you?&#xD;
Walter is at home and will take this letter to you.&#xD;
God bless him for what he has done for me. He will&#xD;
bring me word what you say, but I know what&#xD;
you will say. I know you will keep your word, only&#xD;
it seems almost too good to be true that I shall soon&#xD;
see you, and hear you say with your own sweet lips&#xD;
that you still love me JAMES MORGAN.&#xD;
lit was a grave responsibility resting on Walter, to&#xD;
be in any way concerned in the future destiny of&#xD;
this young couple. He I~iad kept up a correspondence&#xD;
with James, and written\ occasionally to Mr. Brews~&#xD;
ter whom he had partially acquainted with the cir-&#xD;
cumstances, in order to l~iiow better how he kept his&#xD;
promises. The answers ~ie received were very s~t-&#xD;
isfactory.&#xD;
After he had called on James and taken charge&#xD;
of this letter for Mary, it was a subject of grave dis-&#xD;
cussion between himself and his mother, Ernest and&#xD;
&#xD;
238&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Rosalind, how far it would be wise for him to act as&#xD;
negotiator between theni.&#xD;
"I almost wish," said his mother, "that you had&#xD;
never been mixed up with it, although it was a noble&#xD;
motive that prompted you. Her father is bitterly&#xD;
opposed to the union, and he thinks it is broken off.&#xD;
Perhaps he will turn, her out of doors, or lock her&#xD;
up, if she should receive James again, he is such a&#xD;
furious man when angry."&#xD;
"Suppose he should, I do not see how I could&#xD;
have done otherwise, or how I can refuse to act for&#xD;
tMm now. I have jiever advised Mary, of course I&#xD;
should not be so weak as that, but when she made a&#xD;
friend of me and asked my assistance, how could&#xD;
any body help doing for Mary Kingley? Neither&#xD;
would it be honorable for her to break her word with&#xD;
him and refuse to see him, when lie has faithfully&#xD;
performed the conditions she required for her sake."&#xD;
"She will run a great risk even now" said Ernest.&#xD;
"It is one thing to deny himself the gratification of&#xD;
his appetite when the prize is to be won, and another&#xD;
to persevere against all temptation when the die is&#xD;
cast, and he knows, let come what will, there is no&#xD;
longer any outward barrier to restrain him."&#xD;
" Why, it would be the most cruel thing in the&#xD;
world for her not to have him now when he has given&#xD;
her all the proof he can of his repentance and reform.&#xD;
That love is not worth much that is not 'willing tQ&#xD;
trust something."&#xD;
The slight tone of rebuke conveyed in these impres-&#xD;
sive words of Rosalind, and the~ earnestness and en-&#xD;
thusiasm with which she uttered them, excited such&#xD;
&#xD;
289&#xD;

A TALE OP THE&#xD;
&#xD;
a comical smile on the lips of Ernest, that when she&#xD;
glanced at him her face and neck were mantled in&#xD;
crimson. Nothing more was said then upon the&#xD;
subject, and Walter, who agreed most heartily with&#xD;
Rosalind, acted according to his own conviction~,&#xD;
and carried the letter over to Mary the next morning.&#xD;
As ho was ushered into the parlor he met her&#xD;
father in the hall just going out, who, hearing his&#xD;
daughter s name called, gave him a cordial grasp,&#xD;
saying,&#xD;
"Good morning to ye sir, very glad to see ye sir.&#xD;
You'll always l~e welcome, to my house and to my&#xD;
well, we'll talk about that byand by sir. Ye are&#xD;
pretty young yet,, but there's some folks a good deal&#xD;
older'n othei~s at' the same age. llain't got through&#xD;
with your college larnin' yet I 'spose. Well, that's&#xD;
a fine thing to git a good dedication, may be you'll&#xD;
be. President yet and beat 61d Adams all holler.&#xD;
Well, they say, every dog' must have his day, and&#xD;
he'll have hisen, I 'spose, but we shall oust him out&#xD;
at the next election , that's spire. Mary 's a fine gal,&#xD;
a fine gal, and will make on of the genteelest ladies&#xD;
in the land,"&#xD;
Walter was somewhat embarrassed by this an'ibig-&#xD;
nous speech, but he walked into the parlor without&#xD;
making any reply. Mary did not make her appear-&#xD;
ance until her father was gone. Though very pale&#xD;
when she entered, she grew more so on receiving the&#xD;
letter, the handwriting of which she imiX'iediately&#xD;
recognized. Thinking his presence might be an in-&#xD;
trusion at this time, Walter took his leave, saying he&#xD;
would call again the next day, and asking her if she&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
J&#xD;

CONNECTICUT.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
had any choice when. After pausing a moment she&#xD;
said, "To-morrow morning at ten."&#xD;
She could scarcely have felt worse on returning to&#xD;
her chamber if that letter had been her death-war-&#xD;
rant. It lay ,in her lap many minutes unopened.&#xD;
The crisis had conic, a crisis as it were betwech life&#xD;
and death. She never faltered a moment as to her&#xD;
duty, nor wavered in her attachment, btit she knew&#xD;
as well as Ernest the difference between maintaining&#xD;
self-imposed restraints when there is an object to&#xD;
be gained, and after the conditions requiring them&#xD;
no longer exist. Then reproaching herself for in-&#xD;
dulging in such a doubtful strain instead of re-&#xD;
joicing over its contents, which she assumed to be&#xD;
what they really were, she began to read it. The&#xD;
tears came thick and fast, causing her to stop many&#xD;
times before it was finished. stronger than any&#xD;
other consideration rose the all conquering power&#xD;
of love. If she refused him, not only would she&#xD;
incur the risk of his ruin, but carry within her&#xD;
own soul the blight occasioned by the sealing up of&#xD;
her young heart's affections, which would render it&#xD;
callous to every other human love. A sensation of&#xD;
joy and hope, such as those only can know who have&#xD;
witnessed, the rescue of a dear one from 'some immi-&#xD;
nent danger and anxiously watched the signs of re-&#xD;
turning consciousness, swept away every emotion of&#xD;
doubt and fear, and her soul rose in thanksgiving to&#xD;
Him who is the source of every joy. As the dinner,&#xD;
hour approached she thought of her father and the&#xD;
difficulties that awaited her in gaining his consent,&#xD;
who had always boeu. an indulgent parent, and&#xD;

therefore it would be a much harder struggle to act&#xD;
counter to his wishes. lie did not como home until&#xD;
tea-time. At table he looked at Mary with a very&#xD;
benignant smile saying, "Well my bonnie lass, you&#xD;
had a call from Master Claremont this morning didn't&#xD;
you ? iI&amp;amp;s a fine looking' youngster, improved very&#xD;
much since ho's been gone, and many 's the gal that'll&#xD;
envy you my lass, but be sure you keep your cyc on&#xD;

"Father, I don't understand you, what do you&#xD;
mean ? "&#xD;
"All right, all ri~Iit, Mary, it's perfectly natural&#xD;
that you should feel a little shy about iL; that's thd&#xD;
way your mother did,, and when I went up and put&#xD;
my ann round her so, ~he acted as if she~ wanted to&#xD;
get away, but I guess she never had reason to be&#xD;
sorry she married Nico~las Kingley, if lie was a poor&#xD;
boy, and had to make his way up in ~he woi'ld, did&#xD;
ye, oh! Poll?"&#xD;
rp1011 f suppose you will have n ~ objection to&#xD;
James Morgan, now lie is steady?"&#xD;
lie started as if a revolver had whistled past his&#xD;
cars.&#xD;
"Jim Morgan, the wretch, have you seen him?"&#xD;
"N6, I have i~ot seen him."&#xD;
"Then you shall not see him so long as you live&#xD;
in this house ! No ! my daughter shan't disgrace&#xD;
my name by marrying a drunkard's son~ whether he&#xD;
is drunk or sober ; no, never ! " bringing his fist&#xD;
down with such force upon the table as to shatter&#xD;
iji pieces a very delicate and curiously designed&#xD;
vase standing upon it.&#xD;

CONNECTICUT.&#xD;
Mary's resolution was not to be shaken. As an&#xD;
act of duty, it was no more than she ought to do to&#xD;
atone for the wrong he had done James. Tho~igh&#xD;
never lacking in filial respect, she w~s not so blinded&#xD;
by indulgence as not to see in its true colors the&#xD;
misery ~er father had wrought.&#xD;
The nest morning she rose early and looked out&#xD;
at her chamber window, which commanded a romaa~&#xD;
tic view. hills and vales alternated here and there&#xD;
with a sheet of water whiQh found an inlet from the&#xD;
niaiii stream ; manufacturing establishments i.ose in&#xD;
proud preeminence above the little low-roofed cot-&#xD;
tages, that seemed to start up wherever there was a&#xD;
coi~venient spot of ground to erect one ; and the&#xD;
children, some half-dressed, were vicing with each&#xD;
other to see who of them would venture nearest the&#xD;
forbidden stream.&#xD;
Just opposite the window lay the rural cemetery&#xD;
in the bosom of a beautiful grove bordering on the&#xD;
lake. Mary looked at the white gate she had so&#xD;
often seen swung back to admit the funeral proces~&#xD;
sion, bearing hither sonic precious treasure that had&#xD;
been the abode of white-robed innocence, torturing&#xD;
disease, or loathsome sin, whose spirit had gone to&#xD;
the bar of its final Judge, freed from the prejudice~,&#xD;
the temptations, and the ills of its earthly career, to&#xD;
receive its due reward from the measure of impar-&#xD;
tial justice; subject only to him in the light of whose&#xD;
all-seeing eye every secret shall be revealed, and&#xD;
every motive clearly read. She looked beyond the&#xD;
toff~b, and felt that life is but a few years, a speck in&#xD;
the balance of eternity, but love is immortal. What-&#xD;

ever changes might betide her, if, in surrendering&#xD;
herself to it, she should reap a life of wretchedness&#xD;
and want, because he in whom she trusted had not&#xD;
strength to resist the overpoxvering influences of this&#xD;
world, freight he not when taken from them become&#xD;
again the pure and loving spirit lie now is? fier&#xD;
present duty she saw and would perform it; the fu-&#xD;
ture she must trust to God. Oh Love! what magic&#xD;
is thine! no barrier so great but thou can't o'erleap&#xD;
it! She took her Bible and read a chapter before&#xD;
going down to breakfast. Vanquished was evei'y&#xD;
trace of earthly anguish, and her father's averted&#xD;
look had no terrors for her now. The meal was&#xD;
eaten in silence.&#xD;
As Mr. Kingley rose to go out she said to him;&#xD;
Father, may I speak with you a moment ?&#xD;
" You know Aiat I told you last night, " and his&#xD;
voice grew husky with rage,, "if you consent to see&#xD;
James Morgan, y u leave this house forever! I am&#xD;
in earnest."&#xD;
Mary was pre pared for this, and preserved her&#xD;
composure. She saw that her only alternative was&#xD;
to take her father at his w6rd and quit the house.&#xD;
Where to go was the question, but she must leave&#xD;
that to be decided when Walter came. Every mo-&#xD;
ment was now needed to make the hasty preparations&#xD;
for her departure leaving no time for reflection&#xD;
or regret. ~f he canary birds in her window sung&#xD;
their liveliest songs, striving to drown the music of&#xD;
the little birds who sang on. the apple tree boughs,&#xD;
but she scarcely breathed a sigh at the thought that&#xD;

light foot is on the stairs, a ~oft voice is in her ear;&#xD;
her mother stands before her.~ " Oh Mary, you will&#xD;
not leave me will you ? "&#xD;
It was hard to answer that pleading. Mary was&#xD;
the only. sunbeam that had cheered that poor wo-&#xD;
man's existence since she had led a married life.&#xD;
Tiiw~arted in her early love by the opposition and&#xD;
interference of her friends, she had accepted Mr.&#xD;
Kingley out of revenge on them, which, alas! fell&#xD;
most heavily on herself. Neither bringing him any&#xD;

She little thougl~t as she said these last words&#xD;
which had reference to James, how exactly they am&#xD;
plied to her mother. Such a devoted, forgiving na-&#xD;
ture as hers could never havo understood those darker&#xD;
passions which would hazard its own purity and in-&#xD;
tegrity in the strife betxVeen its own promptings and&#xD;
the malicious designs of others. Mrs. Kingley's&#xD;
heart was full. It seemed as if a now elixir of life&#xD;
quickened her pulse and sent its healing balm through&#xD;
every pore~ She said no more to dissuade Mary,&#xD;
but lent her assistance in many little thin's tha t.she&#xD;
understood best how to manage, without asking a&#xD;
word of her plans and intentions. The trunk was&#xD;
paQkcd and Mary was ready at ten o'clock when Wal-&#xD;
ter caine. She met him with a smile, calm and&#xD;
self-possessed. He had the forethought to ask his&#xD;
mother's leave to invite her there to meQt James,.if&#xD;
it should be deemed advisable, so that point was soon&#xD;
settled to Mary's great relief. At eleven the hack&#xD;
came, when she bade adieu to her childhood's home.&#xD;
As her mother asked no questions she t1~ouglut it&#xD;
best to give her no information of her destination,&#xD;
thins enabling Mrs. Kingley to reply to her husband's&#xD;
inquiries that they had held no private interview.&#xD;
She gave her a long and affectionate embrace, Idaving&#xD;
a message for her, father that she had acted solely&#xD;
on her own responsibility, without asking or receiving&#xD;
the advice of any human, being.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
An arrangement was made for .~ames to go to Mrs.&#xD;
Claremont's that evening. A great change had&#xD;
taken place in his looks in one year. His large,&#xD;
handsome eyes had recovered their natural, innocent&#xD;
expression, and his erect bearing and reliant step be-&#xD;
spoke a noble purpose, and the decision to carry it&#xD;
out.&#xD;
How Mary's heart fluttered as she beheld with be-&#xD;
coining pride the manly form whq had wrestled with&#xD;
a o'reater foe than baI1~ or sword had ever slain, and&#xD;
spoke the sacred words of more than usual solemnity&#xD;
to her, "I will be thine forevermore."&#xD;
Under the circui~istances it was agreed that it&#xD;
would not be best t6 defer the marriage more than a&#xD;
mouth. When Walter and his mother were holding&#xD;

It was not without some misgivings Mr. Kingley~&#xD;
came home to innerr that day, some vague suspicion&#xD;
that he should not fi1id Mary there. When convinced&#xD;
that she was really gone, his rage knew no bounds.&#xD;
lie cursed and sxvore, charging his wife with being&#xD;
accessory to her l)lanS. When told that all she knew&#xD;
about it was that a hack came and took her away,&#xD;
he said, "And so you let her go all peaceably did&#xD;
you? Why didn't ye sen after me you cussed hussy?&#xD;
if you'd 'a gone inst ad of her it would have been&#xD;
the most fortunate day Qf my life."&#xD;
lie never thought that Mary would dare to go off,&#xD;
his threats being intended to prevent James from&#xD;
coming there. His pride forbade his makiuu~ any&#xD;
Thither ii iquiries for her, and he settled down morose&#xD;
and reserved.&#xD;

hired a little-cottage of Mr. Brewster, near his own&#xD;
*.1&#xD;
residences, where they were to set up house-keepmng&#xD;
on a small scale, their means being very limited, but&#xD;
it was for them the most attractive, little home, ivluch&#xD;
they would not have exchanged for a palace.&#xD;
There was a plenT to. absorb Rosalind's- energies.&#xD;
She worked incessantly from early morning till late&#xD;
at night, and assumed the whole charge of the wed-&#xD;
ding preparations, having great practical business&#xD;
talent. This was a great help to Mary, who needed&#xD;
the assistance of some one, whlen contending with&#xD;
so many unpleasant recollections, that she would&#xD;
gladly have foregone all needless ceremony. But&#xD;
Ros'ahnd was not to be put off. Marriage, she said,&#xD;
was something that did not take place every day,&#xD;
and ought to be properly observed. She insisted&#xD;
getting' her a white muslin, to corrsodwt&#xD;
one of her own, so they might be dressed alike ;&#xD;
and white, dhoe said, was the only color suitable for a&#xD;
bride. Mary consented with her sweet, pensive&#xD;
smile, though prtsigall the while that she should&#xD;
never wear it afterwards. She did wear it to Rosa-&#xD;
linid's ~wedding.&#xD;

so that was a joyous night at Orange;Grove.&#xD;
Mrs. Claremont enjoyed it, Walter enjoyed it, and&#xD;
a stranger looking on must have enjoyed the sight of&#xD;
so much happiness. It is seldon we see three young&#xD;
men associated, of such interesting appearance, pure&#xD;
and refilled tastes -as Ernest, James and Walter.&#xD;
One must feel sure in looking at them and reading&#xD;
their frank, honest countenances, that if either of&#xD;
them committed an error, it was the fault of the head&#xD;
and not of the heart.&#xD;
Those were halcyon days to all the parties,-days&#xD;
which came back to the memory like the golden&#xD;
tinge of suuset on the fleecy cloud after the fervid&#xD;
glow of the -noontide heat. Like all other days&#xD;
these must have an end, and this soft, summer hour&#xD;
of twilight give way to the reality of earnestness&#xD;
with which we must enter the arena of life and accept&#xD;
both its sunshine and its shadows. The wedding day&#xD;
arrived. There was no invited guest save Ernest,&#xD;
and all went on quietly and serenely as that smiling&#xD;
summer day.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
"All the world's a stage,&#xD;
And all the men and women merely players;&#xD;
They have their exits, and their entrances;&#xD;
And one man in his time plays many parts."&#xD;
flow often it happens when looking forward to a&#xD;
particular event with a certain degree of pleasure,&#xD;
by some capriefous freak of the nervous system our&#xD;
prospects are defeated, and we experience tho reverse&#xD;
of what we anticipated. It was thus with IRosalind&#xD;
on Mary Kingley's wedding day. The cares she had&#xD;
assumed for the last month had been somewhat ox-&#xD;
haustino' and the thoughts of her own approaching&#xD;
bridal agitated her as she and Walter accompanied&#xD;
them to the parlor. Just as th~ ceremony was about&#xD;
to commence, Milly, who was sitting by the side of&#xD;
Ernest, whispered to him, "No~~ you can see how&#xD;
you and Rosalind will look when you stand up."&#xD;
The oddity of this remark in the midst of the so-&#xD;
lemnity of the oc6asion, so out of keeping w~ith her&#xD;
accustomed reserve, especially towards him, excited&#xD;
an involuntary smile, which, observed by Rosalind,&#xD;
brought back to her cheeks the color that had mo-&#xD;
mentarily forsaken them.&#xD;
The usual salutations passed, when Ernest, being&#xD;
in a playful humor, and amused by her childishh per-&#xD;
turbations kissed her instead of the bride, which&#xD;
(250)&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

heighte~ied the flush on her cheeks, and gave rise to&#xD;
a merry laugh all round.&#xD;
The cake was passed, but i~ot the wine, and before&#xD;
the evening shadows gathered, the happy couple were&#xD;
enjoying themselves quietly in~ their own neat little&#xD;
parlor, where they wore soon visited by Deacon&#xD;
Brewster and his wife, who came to offer their con-&#xD;
gratulatio~s, bringing with them a refreshing draught&#xD;
of iced lemonade.&#xD;
"What a pity," said Kate, as the c5riage rolled&#xD;
down the avenue, "wlieii the minister was all here&#xD;
and every thing was ready, that it shouldn't have&#xD;
been all (lone up and saved the trouble of getting' up&#xD;
another marrying. "&#xD;
"You looked as white as a ghost, and trembled&#xD;
like a frighit~ned bird when you took my arm," said&#xD;
Walter to Rosalind after they returned to the parlor,&#xD;
where she stood nervously opening and shutting her&#xD;
fan, lookiiig neither grieved, vexed nor pleased, but&#xD;
the personification of childish helplessness, mutely&#xD;
appealing from one to the other without receiving&#xD;
the assistance it craved.&#xD;
"And I stood on tiptoe ready to get the selling'&#xD;
salts.if you should faint ,~' remarked Kate, intruding&#xD;
her head in the doorway.&#xD;
"They do not know what it is to be so near be-&#xD;
coming a bride do they," observed her mother, who&#xD;
was immediately succeeded by Walter with the re-&#xD;
mark,&#xD;
"I guess, sis, you wish you hadn't been quite ~so&#xD;
officious to act a pr~miuent part in the play yourself,&#xD;
-rather too real, wasn't it 'U'&#xD;

A TALE OF THE&#xD;
&#xD;
"I never felt so bad in my life," replied she in an&#xD;
earnest, emphatic tone.&#xD;
"Oh yes you have," said Ernest, in that quiet, sig~&#xD;
nificant way of his, the meaning of which Rosalind&#xD;
comprehended, when one of her sudden impulses&#xD;
seized her, and she thrust herself unceremoniously&#xD;
into his lap, pulling one of his curls with such force&#xD;
that lie was obliged to interfere in its defence.&#xD;
Milly laughs d at this unexpected turn of affairs&#xD;
and left the rd om. She had enjoyed the day greatly,&#xD;
and was thi4ing now how she, could approp~'iat~&#xD;
some of its clients to her novel. Going to her&#xD;
chamber, she found it already occupied by Kate,&#xD;
whose mind was busily manufacturing weddings on&#xD;
a scale to suit herself.&#xD;
'~ Now Milly," said Kate. after singing a snatch of&#xD;
a song, for she never sung a whole one, "wouldn't&#xD;
it be a capital joke if we could get you married off&#xD;
next. Such a funny thing, if the author of a novel&#xD;
should knock the whole thing in head by getting' mar-&#xD;
ried herself. Ye wouldn't find it quite such a moon-&#xD;
shiny'affair I reckon, as what ye make it out in your&#xD;

*his encounters with iniskeeturs, cause you know&#xD;
when w person 's married, it's just the same as if they&#xD;
was dead. I shouldn't want to bring him up after&#xD;

"I hope you. don't think you are going to impose,&#xD;

&#xD;
such person as Sykes, and you'd 'have told of his&#xD;
marriage before now if there were. I don't care,&#xD;
about hearhi g a d description of it."&#xD;
"Nonsense Milly, there's no use in being so offlsh&#xD;
~tout it. You've got to hear about Sykes' wedding ,&#xD;
whctlnu you want to or not, it was such a magmfi~&#xD;
cent affair. He used to love to take a nap outdoors&#xD;
in the yard and IL used to love to plague him, and&#xD;
he'd always thin  '          ceturs. Sometimes&#xD;
I'd sprii ~kle water in his face, and when he got up&#xD;
I'd ask lim if he had a good nap, and he'd snail up&#xD;
his face like a knot and say, ' Yes if it hadn't been&#xD;
for them tarnal critturs.'&#xD;
Why Sykes ! " says I, " what if you should get&#xD;
that word into your sermons, you never' d get a cub&#xD;
prit's place in the world. Now ho was very fond of&#xD;
Enolish titles, he always thought he descended from&#xD;
the Emxhish, whi cli gin him a sort of nobility in his&#xD;

own eyes, and he'd rather have the title of culprit&#xD;

" No matter, it's all 'the same, if they could only&#xD;
get the mouicy."&#xD;
" \ Therc did it take place, in a shed or a l)alace ? "&#xD;
Hush, Milly, you forgot yourself. You shculdn't&#xD;
make light of sober things, and that was awfully sol-&#xD;
cmii. But then it was such a magnificent affair there&#xD;
had to be some extensive preparations about it. In&#xD;
them days, 'twau't a great while ago though, but you&#xD;
know iii country towns they have some extra building's&#xD;
fdr school'oiises, and so it was thought best to lease&#xD;
one o' them for the occasion, and it was fitted up in&#xD;

254             A TALE OF THE&#xD;
&#xD;
the most fitting' style for such a magnificent affair.&#xD;
In them days, oh 'twan't long ago though, school&#xD;
'ouses were built in a plain substantial style, xvith&#xD;
rough, wooden benches, and Sykes, he had a good&#xD;
deal of taste aiid he thought that wouldn't exactly&#xD;
correspond, and so lie had 'em covered with black&#xD;
drapery. Now he xvas such a simple, honest-hearted&#xD;
sonl he didn't know the difference between a wecidin'&#xD;
and a funeral, and it strikes mc there wouldn't be&#xD;
so much disappiniment in the world if folks giner~&#xD;
ally took that rational view of it. Now Sykes, he~&#xD;
had a gQod deal of taste, and was very fond of flowers&#xD;
so lie had wreathes of sunflowers all round the room,&#xD;
and lie made a great bouquet of sun-flowers he meant&#xD;
to have the bride hold in her hand, but she had so&#xD;
much else in her hiands'~that she looked as if she was&#xD;
goin' to drop it, and so lie just took it and laid it&#xD;
down on the floor between 'em. Then in another&#xD;
thing lie showed great taste as if he wanted to have&#xD;
things about right. He liked the effect of h~vin' it&#xD;
dark which xvould make it a much more magnificent&#xD;
affair than as if 't was light, ~s well as more solemn.&#xD;
So he had the rough board shutters closed and lit&#xD;
sonic taller candles. He hadn't no candle-sticks and&#xD;
he showed his common sense agini, in not hem' over&#xD;
nice on such a solemn occasion. He put oiie in a&#xD;
pewter mug, all pdiished up so it looked like silver,&#xD;
and one, in a chany scarcer that belonged to one of his&#xD;
grandmothers in England. Such associations made&#xD;
it pleasant you know. Them stood, the mug in front&#xD;
o' him, and the chian~r sarcer in, front o' her, so they&#xD;
could see they hadn't got hold of nobody else but&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
CONNECTICUT.            255&#xD;
&#xD;
'themselves. Then he stuck some up all round the&#xD;
room in the wreathes of sun-flowers. I was afraid&#xD;
they might burn down so as to set the sun-flowers&#xD;
a'fire, but theii 'twas all over so quick after they got&#xD;
ready there wan' t no danger. Now I've come to the&#xD;
most interesting' part, how they was dressed. She&#xD;
wore a green calabash on her head, "&#xD;
" A what ? "&#xD;
"A green calabash. Don't you know what that&#xD;
is ? A sort of winuerin' mill they used to wear on the&#xD;
head, with a bridle in front to hold it down, and big&#xD;
enough to put a cheese inside, on each side of the&#xD;
head. Then on that she had a blue gauze veil, and&#xD;
on one arm a work bag with knitting' work in it; and&#xD;
on the other a basket. I can't tell what kind of one&#xD;
it was it wan't round nor square, but long with two&#xD;
coversto it like a half moon. In that was her head-&#xD;
dress, a funny sort of head gear it was tQO. It had&#xD;
a broad white linen frill on one side, and sonic pink&#xD;
gauze on thu other, and right in the middle on top&#xD;
was the imitation of a sun-flower. I 'spose that was&#xD;
the reason she couldn't wear it with her calabash&#xD;
'cause that set down kind o' flat on the top of her&#xD;
head. In one hand she had a yeller silk pocket&#xD;
handkerchief to correspond with the sun-flower, and&#xD;
in the other which had on a gentlema~9s black kid&#xD;
glove, she held a smelling' bottle. That's where they&#xD;
showed their good sense agin, 'cause if any body&#xD;
ever wants smelhin' bottles, then's the time. Then&#xD;
she had on' pin silk stocking's and cowhide shoes, and&#xD;
he had on white slippers and blue cotton stocking's.&#xD;

nessed&#xD;
" When the Squire that was to marry 'em asked&#xD;
him if he would promi~c to love and. take good, care&#xD;
of her ~nd so on, just as if his sayjn' so would make&#xD;
any difference, he pulled back her calabash and gin&#xD;
her such a smack yoi~i could 'a heard it h~df a mile,&#xD;
and says he, ' That's what I reckon II will. '7&#xD;
" What did she say ? did she promise to obey ? "&#xD;
Oh 'she ~was all kind 'o took aback, and then was&#xD;
the time she used the smehlin' bottle. Well, th~e&#xD;
Squire waited until she recovered her senses agin,&#xD;
so she would fully understand what he was sayin'&#xD;
to her, and then proceeded in a solenm voice to tell&#xD;
her how she must honor and obey luni in all things&#xD;
whether sick or well, drunk or sober, and then the&#xD;
poor thing went clean off. Howbeit, with the use&#xD;
of the s'nelHn' bottle she come to agin, and the Squire&#xD;
he was very considerate, he didn't exact any promise&#xD;
of her and it was just as well as if lie had, 'cause it's&#xD;
no inatt&amp;amp;r how much a woman pron~ises she always&#xD;
means to have her own way if she can get it."&#xD;

he's preached himself into paradise, and his wife&#xD;
into purgatory long 'fore this."&#xD;
"Then he didn't think so much of her afterwards ?"&#xD;
"Of course he wouldn't, who does ? There's&#xD;
something' kind o' strange about some o' them things.&#xD;
I never could understand it no how. You take a&#xD;
couple 'fore they's married, and how careful they'll&#xD;
be of each other, as if the very earth wa'nt' good&#xD;
enough for 'em to walk on, and then 'fore the year 's&#xD;
out half on 'em would git unmarried agin if they&#xD;
could."&#xD;
"They should have a bottle of smelling salts by&#xD;
them all the time."&#xD;
"Then another thing 's mighty strange~ when a&#xD;
body dies, how mighty good they is all at once. I&#xD;
never thought my old man was any better for hem'&#xD;
dead."&#xD;

keenly alive to the sorrows of the human family, as&#xD;
if they had tasted all the varied emotions of bliss&#xD;

To this latter class Amelia was assigned. Nothing&#xD;
had occurred to enliven her lot,-~-nothing save the&#xD;
constant communings of her spirit with that invisi-&#xD;

under the shadow oi~ its own protecting love, silently&#xD;

which was opening, like a prismatic view in every&#xD;
shade of coloring, before her awakening faculties&#xD;
and higher consciousness of a duty to be performed.&#xD;
Was that duty to devolve on her,-insigniflcant,&#xD;
uneducated as she was? without a friend to sustain&#xD;
her, or one even to whom she might confide the no-&#xD;
ble impulses of her soul, and, in return, receive&#xD;
sympathizing counsel?&#xD;
The past, with its sufferings, rose up to urge her&#xD;
on; the present, with its oppressive inaction, was un-&#xD;
endurable; and the future. presented no attraction,&#xD;
save as it should veap through her some inestimable&#xD;
benefit to the world.&#xD;
She ~aw all around her evidences of the des6lating&#xD;
scourge th6t had robbed her of her childhood, blighted&#xD;
the fair promises of early womanhood, laid her pa-&#xD;
rents in dishonored graves, and now hung like a pall&#xD;
over the budding hopes of every hearth-stone in .the&#xD;
sand. Was there not work here?&#xD;
But what could she expect to do. when the mighty&#xD;
ones of the earth were silent? True, there was&#xD;
sometimes an effort made, rarely a successful one,&#xD;
to save an individual, wliile tens of thousands were&#xD;
every day rushing into the~ whirling vortex. The&#xD;
church occasionally breathed its anathemas against&#xD;
excessive driukimi g, which availed little, since it would&#xD;
have toppled to the ground if its denunciations had&#xD;
fallen on the heads of those who had growim to be its&#xD;
chief pillars and support through the ill gotten gains&#xD;
they had derived from holding out temptations to&#xD;
that very class whose wiek~dness was comxdemned.&#xD;
surely, a P~amIid responsibility rested somewhere,~a&#xD;

stern necessity ~vas laid on some one to cry out&#xD;
against the wi6kedness.~ If the strong ones were&#xD;
silent it might be because their experience had not&#xD;
been like her own.&#xD;
Had not the weak things of this world been chosen&#xD;
to confound the strong? Was not He who had corn-&#xD;
missioned her for this work able to guide and sustain&#xD;
her through it? But then, perhaps he had not&#xD;
chosen her, and she was only the victim of her own&#xD;
delusions, the ~elPsent messenger on an errand die-&#xD;
tated by the morbid sympathies flowing from her&#xD;
own sufferings. She would banish then~i forever&#xD;
from her mind, rise in the morning with a firm de-&#xD;
termination to harbor no more such irrational con-&#xD;
clusions, and resume her daily task contented and&#xD;
cheerful.&#xD;
The next morning was sure to bring a stronger&#xD;
conviction of her own duty, a greater restlessness&#xD;
under the self-imposed restrictions of it, and she sub&#xD;
emitted to what seemed to be the only alternative to&#xD;
decide the point. She must make the attempt, and&#xD;
the result would very soon show under whose leader-&#xD;
ship she acted; the mortification of a failure being&#xD;
no harder to be borne, than present upbraidings of&#xD;
conscience, arising from resistance to this conviction.&#xD;
* Her resolution once formed she must confide it to&#xD;
some friend who would be willing to assist her, and&#xD;
she selected James Morgan. He did not give her&#xD;
the desired encouragement, but she was not Ais-&#xD;
heartened. The idea struck him as a novel one, and&#xD;
coming from suel a source he had serious doubts of&#xD;
it~ results in aid f the cause. Her design was to&#xD;
&#xD;
give a public lecture in the village where he resided,&#xD;
choosing that place instead of her own city, as it&#xD;
would relieve her of ninny of the embarrassments&#xD;
that would attend her where better known. lit was&#xD;
almost an unheard of thing for a woman to speak in&#xD;
public at all, and that Amelia should propose su~h a&#xD;
thing seemed a most absurd delusion. Finding she&#xD;
was not to be dissuaded, he promised to consult his&#xD;
old friend, Mr. Brewster, who was an Orthodox dea-&#xD;
con of high standing in the church, and also a select-&#xD;
man of great influence in the town. To his surprise&#xD;
he heartily approved of it and encouraged Amelia to&#xD;
go on, saying,- "Ocd only knows what great good&#xD;
may come of an ii~sigi~ificant beginning." Strangers&#xD;
are much more ready to trust a person in a new en-&#xD;
terprise than well known friends, as it is not easy to&#xD;
get over early impressions, or forget known faults&#xD;
which seriously detract from admitted virtues.&#xD;
Deacon Brewster, however, was no distrusting sort&#xD;
of man. He encouraged people by trusting them,&#xD;
not blindly, but with a great deal of discretion and&#xD;
sound judgment. Amelia's unyielding determfna-&#xD;
tion impressed him favorably, and he dared not, if&#xD;
he felt doubts, discourage the least attempt to stay&#xD;
the swelling tide of intemperance.&#xD;
A firm adherent to the rituals of the church, he&#xD;
n~vee considered his creed too sacred to be tested by&#xD;
deeds. No construction of, Scripture texts ever de-&#xD;
terred him from giving his heart and hand to every&#xD;
effort for the elevation of the human race.&#xD;

Jesus against St. Paul. If ho Was cautioned against&#xD;

the danger of innovations, he cited Christ,. the&#xD;
prophets and apostles as the greatest innovators for&#xD;
the banishment of' all existing wrongs wherever&#xD;
found. "Whatever thy heart and thy hand find to&#xD;
do, that shalt thou do," was his* motto. If those&#xD;
who promised well for a time gave out, he was neither&#xD;
discouraged nor lost his faith in human nature. If&#xD;
he subscribed to the doctrine of total depravity, he&#xD;
could not obliterate the lurking consciousness some-&#xD;
where that in every individual, however vicious and&#xD;
depraved, was a gTham of the divinity of manhood,&#xD;
which commended him to the everlasting mercy of&#xD;
an ever merciful God, to which he appealed in love&#xD;
and trust, not in fear and anger, aiA his labors were&#xD;
fruitful.&#xD;

curiosity, others, especially. women, from their heart-&#xD;
felt sympathy and interest in the cause.&#xD;
As she passed through the crowd with Mr. Brewster,&#xD;
many remarks, some not very flattering, reached her&#xD;
ears. There were groups collected in every corner&#xD;
discussing the subject, in o~e of which she distin-&#xD;
guished two or three familiar voices* inveighing&#xD;
against the propriety of women appearing in public,&#xD;
an.d predicting certain failure. One was the \voll&#xD;
known YQiOO of Mr~ Kingley ,'greatly excited.&#xD;
":1 should like to I~now what business it is of her'n,&#xD;
&#xD;
262.&#xD;
&#xD;
and~the long and short on~t is that it ain't none of&#xD;
her business, and she shan't meddle with our'n, she&#xD;
shall be put down and I'll raise a ~ow to stop her&#xD;
mouth the first. word."&#xD;
"Hush! keep still, and let her make a fool of her-&#xD;
self if ~he wants to, I'll risk all the damage she does&#xD;
to our business, the boys will hoot her out of town.&#xD;
Let her alone, and I'll warrant a brisker trade to-&#xD;
morrow than we've had yet. I wouldn't take no no-&#xD;
tice of such a little upstart."&#xD;
"A pity we took notice ~n~oug1i on her to come&#xD;
and hear her Ii think," said a third, "but I kind o'&#xD;
wanted to see what Bill Crawford's darter expects&#xD;
she is goin' to do agin us all. Any body 'd 'spose&#xD;
she thought she'd got some mighty big blood in her&#xD;
veins, to think what's got to be endured can be&#xD;
cured."&#xD;
Some little confusion ensued after the remarks of&#xD;
the last speaker who was about half deprived of his&#xD;
reason, and clearly not one of the "caste" who dealt&#xD;
out the poison. rho equivocal sound of his last sen-&#xD;
tence gave great offence.&#xD;
A fourth stepped in as a mediator. "Let her&#xD;
alone," said he, " and she will soon show herself out,&#xD;
tbr nobody will, run after such a whim but silly, weak-&#xD;
minded wives, disconsolate widows, and discontented&#xD;
old maids."&#xD;
This was evidently thought a good hit from the&#xD;
coarse laugh that foAowed, and very creditable to the&#xD;
profound sense of the lawyer dandy who uttered it&#xD;
and afterwards marched into the school-house with a&#xD;
very comfortable appreciation of his own merits.&#xD;

&#xD;
Amelia heard this conversation as they slowly ad-&#xD;
vanced, halting every moment for the crowd to give&#xD;
way, who were apparently unconscious of her iden-&#xD;
tity with the they had turned out to hear.&#xD;
She looked very much like other people, and they&#xD;
expected to see-~-an elephant. There was .no little&#xD;
dissatisfaction and disappointment among curiosity&#xD;
seekers when she took her seat.&#xD;
Deacon Brewster rose and addressed them briefly.&#xD;
"My friends," said he, "1 congratulate you upon&#xD;
the privilege that awaits you to-night in listening to&#xD;
one who has herself experienced the evils flowing&#xD;
from the curse of intemperance, which no pen is ad-&#xD;

dismal echo-Rum!&#xD;
'~ Seek the causes that most disgrace society any-&#xD;

them, in the maddening pleasures of the bowl. I&#xD;

p     most must be the one to exert the greatest influence&#xD;
in this holy cause.&#xD;
"When a man becomes so degraded ~1s to accept&#xD;
i.    the gutter for his lodging place, he is insensible to all&#xD;
the refinement of his nature, and does not realize&#xD;
his situation, while his wife is compelled to witness&#xD;
from day to day the gradual sinking of her brightest&#xD;
hopes and noblest conceptions of what constitutes a&#xD;
pure and honorable manhood, down, down below the&#xD;
lowest attributes of.the brute creation. Oh, woman I&#xD;
what hast thou not suffered! Never until speech is&#xD;
given to the green sods of the valley, which have in-&#xD;
terposed their friendly hands to shield forevermore&#xD;

r&#xD;
As Amelia rose, a sinking sei~sation began to creep&#xD;
over her, when she cast her eye in one corner where&#xD;
Mr. Kingley sat crossed-legged, arms folded across&#xD;
his chest, head leaning one side, and his scornful&#xD;
eyes peering at her with a malignity that reminded&#xD;
her of one particular evening, when her mother,&#xD;

goaded to desperation, implored him for her sake&#xD;
and for her child, if nothing more, to sell her hus-&#xD;

took hold of her roughly and pointed to the street,&#xD;
when she, not heeding where she went, fell down&#xD;
several stone steps, from the painful effects of which&#xD;
she never recovered. There was no more weakness,&#xD;
no more trembling, no more hesitation,-~--only tho&#xD;
bitter. memories of the past 5w filled her mind.&#xD;
"Friends,~' said she, "~~ou may think an apology&#xD;

assuming the highest responsibilities God has im-&#xD;

is the heritage of all mankind, and grow like unto&#xD;

they prove not life's highest blessings, will, be its&#xD;
greatest curse?&#xD;
"Woman fats a right to speak, because she is the&#xD;

&#xD;
which, in the dread silence of the night, is the por~&#xD;
tentous omen for the coming morrow.&#xD;
"What hope has she to cheer her? what sign of&#xD;
joy comes to penetrate. the gloom closing thicker and&#xD;
darker around her little ones, for whom alas! she&#xD;
sees nothing but a future of degradation and shame.&#xD;
"Oh, God! the sufferer's friend! Thou alone&#xD;

naught of the exact measurement of the relative&#xD;
claims of each, neither absolves any from the right-&#xD;

*     "The first and most important question for us to&#xD;
decide, is the person to whom attaches the greatest&#xD;
* guilt. Where is the fountain-source of this long&#xD;
catalogue' of woes? It is of little use to lop the&#xD;
branches while the root is left untouched. It is&#xD;
wrong, as well as useless, to condemn the drinker&#xD;
and spare the seller, if we wish to eradicate the evil.&#xD;
Eradicate it? You will doubtless say that is impos~&#xD;
sible, and perhaps it is, so loi~ig as avarice and selfish-&#xD;
ness rule the human heart. But we may place it&#xD;
wider the ban of society, we may award to it the&#xD;
same condemnation as t~ other sins, and, like high-&#xD;
way robbery, make it the exception,-not the rule.&#xD;
Is it not ten-fold worse?&#xD;
"The highway robber only plunders the pocket;&#xD;

the man who sells liqilKor sends both the body and&#xD;
soul of his victim into, the hell-fire of the most loathe&#xD;

ar~ there any among you who have felt the drunk~&#xD;
ard's remorse? Is it not the most perfect exempli-&#xD;
cation of the horrors of the burning pit it is possible&#xD;
to conceive?&#xD;
"Stung with reproach at the thought of' what he&#xD;
might have been, tortured by a raging thirst beyond&#xD;
human power to assuage, life presents a fearful prec-&#xD;
ipice, whence, to look back is misery and woe; to&#xD;
look forward is the ghastly blight of immortal powers&#xD;
and aspirations destined for the development of god-&#xD;
like capacities, which, from their perversion, goad&#xD;
him with a double edge in those momentary gleams&#xD;
of reason aiXd consciousness, when, in utter despair,&#xD;
he strives to drown them all by plunging into still&#xD;
greater excesses. Is his guilt t6 be compared with'&#xD;
that of the other, who, in t1~ full possession of his&#xD;
faculties, in the broad daylight of the wretchedness&#xD;
and wo his hand has wrought, still deals out the&#xD;
deadly poison to continue the work of desolation?&#xD;
Is he any more deserving of the penalty of the law&#xD;
for crime committed under the influence of strong&#xD;
drink, than he who lets him have 'it, knowing its pei~-&#xD;
nicious effect'?"&#xD;
Fixing her eyes on Mr. Kingley, who sat with head&#xD;
down, and his cap pulled over his face, as if&#xD;
screen himself as much as possible from the gaze&#xD;
of the crowd, she continued, "If there are any&#xD;
within sound of my voice 'to-night who presume to'&#xD;

11cr remarks were listened to throughout with&#xD;
deep attention,.-.iiot a murmur of disapprobation&#xD;
was heard, and young men who had gone there to&#xD;

jeer and taunt, came away with Veverence and plau-&#xD;

up to sign the pledge Mr. Brewster had drawn up.&#xD;
When she closed there was manifested a deep sen-&#xD;
sation among the crowd, in the midst of which arose&#xD;
an old man apparently, with trembling limbs and the&#xD;
other accompaniments of an unsteady life, who spoke&#xD;
with a loud voice, saying,-&#xD;
"I want to make a temperance speech!"&#xD;
A general titter ran through the groups of boys&#xD;
collected here and there in every available space,&#xD;
which increased as he went forward to occupy the&#xD;
desk at Mr. Brewster's solicitation.&#xD;
"Young men," said he, "look at me. You may&#xD;

"I despise myself not only for what I am, but for&#xD;

He grasped the pCII co~vaLively and wrote his&#xD;
name with a firm though trembling hand. A breath~&#xD;
less silence pervaded the room, and all eyes were&#xD;
fixed on Henry Morgan, foi~ such was his name; the&#xD;
father of James; on Mr. Kingley, whose head was&#xD;

Mary who sat a few, seats behind him, both of whom&#xD;

Never since he turned Mary from his door had he&#xD;

the little ray of warmth she had excited in his rough&#xD;

"The hours are viewless angels,.&#xD;

And bear each minute's record up.&#xD;
To Him who sits on high."&#xD;
The f~w weeks of Walter's vacation in the sum~&#xD;
mer passed so quickly that Rosalind scarcely realized&#xD;
their flight until the time came for his departure.&#xD;
Every moment was so occupied, and events of such&#xD;
interest and importance transpired, that it left very&#xD;
little of the impression of a holiday recreation to any&#xD;
of the parties. When the excitement was over and&#xD;
the hous~ settled into its usual quiet, the active,&#xD;
restless spirit of Rosalipd was far from being con-&#xD;
tented and happy, even in anticipation of the pleas-&#xD;
ant prospects before her. Her visits to Mart Kingley&#xD;
were very frequent, and, excepting the time ~he spent&#xD;

her life through the ensuing autumn. TI~e promi-&#xD;

That she, a girl of no culture, no advantages, no&#xD;
friends,, and apparently below the average of people&#xD;
in point of talent, should have so far outdone her,&#xD;
who had all these advantages, made her own lifer&#xD;
seem very insignificant. Neither was. she lacking in&#xD;
experience, tl~e deepest source of inspiration, for few&#xD;
of hex' age had passed through a sterner discipline.&#xD;
/ She felt no prompting to such a mission, hut the&#xD;
boldness and independence of the step commanded'~&#xD;
her warmest admiration.&#xD;
Amelia possessed an advantage in. not having' any&#xD;
position to sacrifice, but on. the contrary, a reputation&#xD;
togain in the course she was pursuing. If in the&#xD;
eyes of the world she was .stepping out of her~ sphere,&#xD;
no one could deny an amount of energy and ability.&#xD;
which surprised them all, and won a certain kind&#xD;
of respect. Being of too gentle a nature to exhibit&#xD;
those prominent traits of decision and self-will which&#xD;
are apt to be conspicuous in those who contend suc~&#xD;
cessfuhly with opposition, she could be accused~ of&#xD;
nothingg unfeminine in manner or speech, and the.&#xD;
deep religious feeling pervading all her actions only:&#xD;
added to the prevailing sentiment of the higher re~&#xD;
ligious nature attributed to woman. There was no&#xD;

her veins and radiated every feature. Friendsgath~&#xD;

A TALE OF THE&#xD;
&#xD;
An incident soon occurred, however, which was&#xD;
sufficient to engage IRosalind's mind, and start a train&#xD;
of thought that was not likely soon to be exhausted.&#xD;
A crime had been committed, and suspicion fas-&#xD;
tened upon a poor young girl, who led a Wander-&#xD;
ing life and obtained a living, no one knew how.&#xD;
Valuable goods had been stolen, and her presence&#xD;
the same day at the store whence they were taken&#xD;
was considered sufficient proof to warrant her arrest.&#xD;
The missing articles were also found in the building&#xD;
whither she resorted, of which th~ other inmates de-&#xD;
clared themselves wholly ignorant, and she was si-&#xD;
lent, making UQ reply t~ aiiy interrogatories addressed&#xD;
to her. Her stolid indifference surprised even the&#xD;
hardened officials who took her in ci~stody, and&#xD;
yet there was something in her face in strik~n g coii-&#xD;
trast with her apparent recklessness. An air of in-&#xD;
nocence breathed through her demeanor, wholly&#xD;
irreconcilable with the low companionship she seemed&#xD;
to have chosen; but neither persuasion nor entreaty&#xD;
could draw from her a single word of her history.&#xD;
When asked if she had any friends who would in~&#xD;
terest themselves in her favor, she resolutely shook&#xD;
her head, and it was evident to all that she must&#xD;
suffer the full penalty of the law, so strongly conch&#xD;
sive of her guilt were all the circumstances against&#xD;
her, while no one appeared in her behalf.&#xD;
Amelia had frequent interviews with her, and&#xD;
after repeated attempts succeeded in drawing her&#xD;
into conversation.. She denied all participation in&#xD;
the theft, but confessed to a partial knowledge of&#xD;
it. By degrees Amelia drew from her a sketch of&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
her life, degraded enough, yet free from aeti~ia1 guilt&#xD;
or personal dishonor and extremely touching. Amelia&#xD;
related some of the leading incidents to Mr. Brewster&#xD;
and his wife, and also to James Morgan, all of whom&#xD;
felt a deep interest in the prisoner, and a strong de-&#xD;
sire that she should have able counsel. To this, how-&#xD;
ever, she seemed perfectly indifferent, refusing to&#xD;
communicate to any one but Amelia.&#xD;
The pen of an author may sketch in glowing pic-&#xD;

creature of fact or fiction, which shall stir every gen-&#xD;
erous emotion. of the soul, while every day, had we&#xD;
but eyes to see; and hearts to feel, the same incidents&#xD;
are coming within the range of our observation,&#xD;
and we carelessly pass them by without a thought.&#xD;
The real poetry of the soul which it is the true fune-&#xD;
tion of the novelist to portray, fails to make itself&#xD;
felt in its daily contact with others, unless there is a&#xD;
corresponding delicacy of perception which is able to&#xD;
distinguish the lineaments of real suffering from the&#xD;
impositions so often practiced in its name.&#xD;
Fortunately it happened that Walter was at home&#xD;
at the time the trial was coming~ on, and having&#xD;
been acquainted with the facts, resolved to defend&#xD;
her himself. True to the choice of his boyhood,&#xD;
his mind was still fixed on the legal profession as&#xD;
the pursuit of his life, toward, which he looked as&#xD;
the goal of a laudable ambition, where he would&#xD;
have ample opportunities to befriend the friendless,&#xD;
as well as to gratify hi~ own ardent aspirations. This&#xD;
ease enlisted all the benevolent impulses of his soul,&#xD;
and kiu~ied anew. the enthusiasm he had ever felt&#xD;

"Law, which \has her seat in the bosom of God."&#xD;
Without solicitation, or even preparation, he took his&#xD;
scat in the co~irt-room,. and listened to all the OV~&#xD;
dence, carefully observing the prisoner who stood&#xD;
with downcast eyes, manifesting the same indiffer-&#xD;
ence, scarcely appearing to notice anything that was&#xD;
said or done, until Walter arose, when those who&#xD;
observed her, perceived a slight tremor, a flashing of&#xD;
the eye when he began, which gradually softened as&#xD;
he went on. He spoke strongly against the danger&#xD;
of accepting circumstantial evidence as the conclu-&#xD;
sive proof of her guilt, discussed the divine nature&#xD;

alluded to the possible circumstances of her child-&#xD;
hood, the friendlessness of her position, the helpless-&#xD;
ness of her situation, and drew a vivid picture of all&#xD;
the difficulties attending "a homeless, penniless fe-&#xD;

&#xD;
"May God, forgive me the wrong I have done you,&#xD;
and done myself!"&#xD;
Walter extended his hand, and requested an ex~-&#xD;
planation.&#xD;
She was very weak, and the effort that exclama-&#xD;
tion cost her had iiearly wasted the little strength&#xD;
she had. Desiring to be raised in the bed, she looked&#xD;
round the chamber, and fully consc~ou~ of ~hwt had&#xD;
taken place, and where she was, spoke hi substance&#xD;
as follows:&#xD;
"Here I am within the walls of a prison, awaiting&#xD;
the penalty of the law, instead df sharing its protec-&#xD;
tion, if God should see fit to spare me; and yet I&#xD;
speak the truth when I say that never before since&#xD;
my mother l~ft me, have I been so comfortably pro~&#xD;
vided for, or kindly eared for. For four years your&#xD;
face has haunted me; yes, you have been the evil&#xD;
genius that has driven me to desperation. Nay, do&#xD;
not start, it was all my fault, I see now how wicked&#xD;
it was in me, but I did not know any better, and&#xD;
there was nobody to teach me."&#xD;
She stopped, and closed her eyes as if to shut out&#xD;
some bitter memory, then rallied again and pro-&#xD;
ceeded. Her voice was fainter iiow, and Walter&#xD;
would have had her rest, but lie feared it was the&#xD;
last opportunity, and his curiosity was greatly ex-&#xD;
cited to know what strange connection he had with&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"My mother," said she, and she lowered her voice&#xD;
to a whisper, as if afraid even to speak it now, "was&#xD;
a slave. She ran. away before I was born and came&#xD;
north, where she lived until I was ten years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
She used to tell me about it, and try to assure her~&#xD;
self' that she was safe now and had nothing more to&#xD;
fear, but child as I was, I knew she was afraid of&#xD;
something, by the way she used to start when she&#xD;
heard an unusual noise, or when a stranger spoke to&#xD;
her. She would tell me sometimes that if ever any~&#xD;
.body attempted to carry her off, never to tell that she&#xD;
was my mother, for then they would take too,&#xD;
and that was what she ran away for so that I should&#xD;
not be a slave. I am quite white you see, she said&#xD;
I had my father's complexion, who was her master,&#xD;
and therefore a white man. She would not let me&#xD;
call her mother, but maimny, as the most sure way&#xD;
to escape detection. I. dou~t remember hcw she&#xD;
lived and got along with me, I only remember these&#xD;
things that I wish I could forget, for they have&#xD;
burned my very soul ou~ of me. They came and&#xD;
took her one day when she was at work at a tavern,&#xD;
a~id I saw her go. She rn~de no outcry. I have&#xD;
wondered so many times since why she did not, but&#xD;
perhaps it was for my sake, thinking if she went&#xD;
peaceably I should not be discovered. She gave me&#xD;
one agonizing look, and motioned me to be still. I&#xD;
suppose she thought it impossible for me to have so&#xD;
hard a fate here under any circumstances as I should&#xD;
meet th&amp;amp;re. i~erhaps not, but this is a hard world.&#xD;
I only ask tha1~ I may die now, and II will trust the&#xD;
mercy of God4'&#xD;
She sunk back exhausted, but revived again in a&#xD;
few i~oments.&#xD;

about begging a subsistence, going every night to a.&#xD;
place where my mother had made it her home; but&#xD;
they soon got tired of me, and treated me harshly if&#xD;
I failed to~- bring them home something. After a&#xD;
while found it was impossible to get enough to sat-&#xD;
isfy my own hunger; and one dark, stormy night,&#xD;
when I was suffering intensely with cold and hunger,&#xD;
not daring to go home, as I called it, I thought I&#xD;
would try some of the rich folk's houses, and see if&#xD;
I could get something there.. Seeing a bright light&#xD;
in a large house standing a little back from the&#xD;
street, I ventured to go there, and before I dared to&#xD;
knock, I peeped through the window; and then a&#xD;
dog barked and frightened me, and I ran off. That&#xD;
night, and what I saw ~through the window, I never&#xD;
could forget, I suffered so much. I knew you the&#xD;
minute I looked towards you in the court-room, and&#xD;
the first' thought was that you had come to seal my&#xD;
fate. You were a young boy then, but your face is&#xD;
m~ot changed. You looked so happy as you sat at&#xD;
the table ; and right opposite i~as a girl with curly&#xD;
hair, who looked up as I turned away, and. a cat lay&#xD;
there asleep. I thought of my own wretchedness,&#xD;
when a spirit of revenge and hatred took possession&#xD;
of me, that I, a child, should be doomed to such&#xD;
misery, while even the brutes of the rich maii's fain-&#xD;
fly were oared for and fed. XVhat had I done that&#xD;
no one should care for me? When I went into the&#xD;
street again a watchman took me up and put me in&#xD;
a room somewhere where they kept me till morning,&#xD;
when, with a reprimand, I was permitted to go at&#xD;
large again. I grew heedless of my looks and ac-&#xD;

of sin and corruption those are driven to accept who&#xD;

She ceased speaking, being too exhausted to say&#xD;
more, and Walter hastened home to acquaint his&#xD;
mother and Rosalind with this novel arid- affectii~g&#xD;
item of his experience. He would have considered&#xD;
the whole relation an effect of her mental aberration,&#xD;
but for the accuracy of the little incident connected&#xD;

opened her eyes languidly without appearing to no-&#xD;

went out to the pump he followed her and gagged&#xD;
her so she could not make any noise, told her she&#xD;
was 'his slave and threatened her if she gave any&#xD;
alarm, and so she went off. Oh God! why should&#xD;
we live to suffer so much?"&#xD;
She appeared to be slightly wandering in her man~&#xD;
ner, but her words were coherent, and impressed&#xD;
one wit1~ a strong~ degree ci truthfulness, yet it&#xD;
seemed~ scarcely credible that such a deed could have&#xD;
been done without being knq~wn'.&#xD;

her voice,&#xD;
"Yes! you will be brought to judgment! for&#xD;
such deeds as these whiQh you think will never be&#xD;
known, shall this nation yet be clothed in sackcloth&#xD;
and ashes! Oh God! receive my spirit, Thou who&#xD;
art the poor one's friend."&#xD;
She sunk back exhausted, panting for breath, and'&#xD;
soonAeli into a quiet slumber. As she lay there&#xD;
&#xD;
passionless and still it was easy to trace the hinea~&#xD;
ments of a highly wrought organization; too proud&#xD;
to stoop to things low' and mean, too sensitive to&#xD;
brQok the world's scorn. While desperation had&#xD;
driven her to the vagrant life she led, it was evident&#xD;
that the publicity of being arrested as* a criminal&#xD;

addition to the powerful reaction which took place&#xD;
when Walter appeared in her behalf, that her mind&#xD;
lost its balance; the rigor of a prison life having&#xD;
rapidly undermined the health that had previously&#xD;
begun to fail. '&#xD;
At set of sun her spirit passed away. It is' impos~&#xD;
sible to describe the sensations of Liosalind as she&#xD;
gazed on that motionless form, looking even beauti~&#xD;

pathy which too often repels those who would othor~&#xD;

dispensed with, that it was almost by compulsion&#xD;
Ernest could gain her undivided attention, even for&#xD;
a single evening. Like a cat just ready to jump,&#xD;
unless there was something to consult him about, her&#xD;
hand was on the point of withdrawing from hi~ the&#xD;
moment he took it, as something was sure to recur&#xD;
to her mind that must be done then, or it would be&#xD;
forgotten. Systematic in all her arrangements, her&#xD;
rulitig desire that every trifling thing, unconnected&#xD;
with herself, should be properly attended to, sprung&#xD;
from a consciousness, which iti her demonstrative&#xD;
nature could not fail of expression, that she had&#xD;
reached a dividing point in her life where the closing&#xD;
hours of the era just past would yield satisfaction&#xD;
in proportion to the duties fulfilled, though they&#xD;
might be nothing more than to gratify her love of&#xD;
order and completeness. Any one similarly con-&#xD;
stituted will understand this feeling from experience&#xD;
on other occasions than this. A journey yields&#xD;
much more pleasure upon the reflection that no duty&#xD;
has been neglected, and every thing has been left in&#xD;
its proper place at home, even at the expense of a&#xD;
hurried preparation. Rosahind was of such a pos-&#xD;
itive nature that any omission, however slight, dis..&#xD;
turned her peace of mind. Perhaps she had proiu.&#xD;
ised some poor, lone woman, to spend an hour in&#xD;
reading to her, or to repair some article of dress&#xD;
for which young eyes xvere needed, but not so. much&#xD;
as the bloom of young hearts, which detained her&#xD;

all her plans completed, and she seated herself by~&#xD;

sufficiently to come to the sober second thought of&#xD;

secured from a mass of articles collected for Kate,&#xD;

Mrs. Claremont smiled as she met her daughter&#xD;
at breakfast, but her thoughts were turned into a&#xD;
channel too serious for much demonstration of levity.&#xD;
When she arose, she approached Ro salind, and throw-&#xD;
ing her arms around her, said,--." And is this the last&#xD;
Sabbath morning on which I can call you exclusively&#xD;
my own?"&#xD;
A sudden revulsion df feeling swept over Rosalind&#xD;
at these words, and it w~s difficult for her to restrain&#xD;
the fast coming tears. Thoughts of her father and&#xD;
the reflection that ~he ~yas so soon to part with the&#xD;
freedom ar.d indepond5nce of giulhood, tinged. her&#xD;
anticipations with a sort of mournful pleasure. With&#xD;
a thoughtful and reverent air the remainder of the&#xD;
day was chiefly devoted to her mother whose side she&#xD;
scarcely left. At church the sound of the music&#xD;
thrilled her with unusual fervor as if it heralded the&#xD;
advent of a new life whose record would be pure or&#xD;
sullied as she cultivated in her own soul those graces&#xD;
which should make it worthy the love of him who&#xD;
had chosen her for his companion through the storm&#xD;
and sunshine of their earthly career, and most ar-&#xD;
dently she prayed for strength.&#xD;
The wedding day at length arrived, the day which&#xD;
for its tender and sacred associations, was scarcely&#xD;
less of interest to Mrs. Claremont than to the pro-&#xD;
spective bride. It was a day of her own selection,&#xD;
the anniversary of her marriage twenty-two years&#xD;

before, the memory of which brought no sadness,&#xD;
but a perpetual joy.&#xD;

bridal, she lived over again her young days without&#xD;
a regret to dim their radiance. Her passion for&#xD;
orange-bloom was not abated, and as it had presided&#xD;
at her own marriage festival, she wished it also to&#xD;
grace Rosalin d's. Sh~ had then three trees laden&#xD;
with blossoms whose perfume filled the rooms. Then&#xD;
her favorite arbutus was strewn in~ lavish profuson,&#xD;
and a few exotics, like stray visitors, were welcomed&#xD;
to add their rich and varied beauty to the festivities&#xD;
of the occasion.&#xD;
Rosalind wore a charmed expression, one of unu-&#xD;
sual serenity. She had accomplished every thing&#xD;
she intended, and nothing was left for this day which&#xD;
could be done before. She indulged in all the poetry&#xD;
of soul such an hour is calculated to inspire, and&#xD;
when the tiinb came for her to dress, went about it&#xD;
as calmly as if she were merQly to spend an &amp;amp;vening&#xD;
out. Ernest re-arranged the orange blo6m in. her&#xD;
hair according to his artistic taste, after which they&#xD;
were ready to descend to the parlor.&#xD;
Kate, who with becoming. de1~rence had refrained&#xD;
from her sallies of wit during the day, could no&#xD;
longer control herself, after being permitted with&#xD;
Milly and Amelia The honor of assisting at the bridal&#xD;
decorations, and addressed him, Saying,-" If you do&#xD;

rich profusion over' the pearl colored silk that was&#xD;
Mrs. Claremont's choice for her daughter's wedding&#xD;
dross.&#xD;
Upon reaching the stairs, a sound as of distant mu-&#xD;
~ic fell upon their ears, wl~ich gradually approached&#xD;
nearer until they reached 4 the parlor, when a choir&#xD;
of infant voice~ in an adjoining room suing a hymn&#xD;
appropriate to the occasion. It was well for Rosa~&#xD;
hind that she had attained so much composure that&#xD;
day, or she would have found the exercises too&#xD;
lengthy, notwithstanding all she had said about the&#xD;
hasty inannei in which the marriage ceremony is apt&#xD;
to be coiisummated. When with solemn emphasis&#xD;
'the minister addressed her with the query, "if she&#xD;
would promise to love, honor and ol~ey," she gave&#xD;
not the slightest token of response. rrl)~t ~ti-&#xD;
gating mind had unpremeditatedly started off on a&#xD;
train of thought suggested by the occasion and the&#xD;
words, which could not comprehend the connection&#xD;
of the phrase with their relations to each other.&#xD;
The hour was too sacred,-the lingering influence of&#xD;
the music too exalted to be desecrated by an assent&#xD;
to any unmeaning phrase or unhallowed require-&#xD;
mont which would give the lie to the pledge of mu-&#xD;
tual love, reverence and ~quality each acknowledged&#xD;
as their bond of union.&#xD;
When the services wei~e concluded, a troop of six&#xD;
young girls, dressed in white with wreaths of the&#xD;
arbutus and orange bloom inte~'twined with sprigs of&#xD;

CONNECTICUT.             293&#xD;

them, singing,-&#xD;
"Now we come to greet you."&#xD;
The whole was 'a surprise, arranged by Mrs. Clare~&#xD;
mont.. Her own married life had been so singularly&#xD;
harmonious and happy, sbe could scarcely -harbor a&#xD;
doubt that according to present indications her&#xD;
daughter's would be equally so. So insignificant in&#xD;
the presence of an overwhelming joy seems the re-&#xD;
membraiice of' all our griefs, that the future only,&#xD;
with its blank pages of virgin whiteness opens before&#xD;
us, about whiTh it seems almost a sacrilege to breathe,&#xD;
the thought of coming sorrow. The sound of the&#xD;
infant voices died away, and soon after the vibrations&#xD;
of the piano, when an impressive silence followed as&#xD;
the most fitting response for feelings too deep for&#xD;
expression. It was broken by the officiating minis~&#xD;
ter, n~xv slightly silver~haired, who, when a young&#xD;
man, had joined the hands of Alfred Claremont and&#xD;
Marianne Beaufort.&#xD;
"I cannot forbear," he said, "giving utterance to&#xD;
my heartfelt joy, arising from emotions excited in&#xD;
an hour like this. ill have often wished that music&#xD;
had been ordained a part of the marriage ritual.&#xD;
Nothing could be more appropriate to such an occa-&#xD;

closest friendship. One thing alone detracted from&#xD;
its unalloyed enjoyment, which was her longing de-&#xD;
sire to visit her old home and see her mother. This.&#xD;
could not be, since her father had abated none of his&#xD;
former harshness, arid had absolutely forbidden her&#xD;
mother to see her on any condition whatever. Often&#xD;
in the silence of the night with none l)Ut God to wit-&#xD;
ness, had she wrestled with this in ward pain, and as&#xD;
resolutely shut it out when day brought its cares&#xD;
that none might know, especially James, the strug-&#xD;

Rosahind, who often visited and sympathized with&#xD;
her, knew more of it perhaps than any one else. In&#xD;
answer to a salutation with which she frequently&#xD;
greeted her, "As happy as ever?" she would say,&#xD;

Walter was at the height of enjoyment. His visit&#xD;

with the occasion to render it more than usually in-&#xD;

is the charm of twilight. The outward eye and the&#xD;
inner sense hold sweet communion there, and no&#xD;
hour is so dear for social converse.&#xD;

&#xD;
husband and wife. No two persons can know each&#xD;
other intimately in any relation of life until they&#xD;
have lived together long enough to discover the&#xD;
sharp angles and latent virtues which elude the ob-&#xD;
servation of casual observers, no matter how often&#xD;
they meet, if they do not come in contact sufficiently&#xD;
to clash. It is only by a rough blow the steel emits&#xD;
its spark.&#xD;
It was about six months after they were married&#xD;
that Mr. Livingston was invited to deliver an oration&#xD;
before a literary society in a neighboring city whither&#xD;
he was to be accompanied by two acquaintances who&#xD;
dined with him the same day. His wife was deeply&#xD;
interested in their conversation which turned mostly&#xD;
on literary and scientific subjects.&#xD;
After dinner she left the three to themselves and&#xD;
withdrew to her chamber where she remained until&#xD;
the hour came for their departure, when Ernest re-&#xD;
paired thither. He was surprised to find her sitting&#xD;
in an abstracted manner, looking thoughtfully out&#xD;
at the window, and scarcely observing his entrance.&#xD;
"Why Rosa," said he, "how blue you look!&#xD;
One might take you for the heroine of a love-tale&#xD;
whose honey-moon is over, and she i~ wishing herself&#xD;
back to maidenhood again.".&#xD;
She answered his salutation by a vacant smile, still&#xD;
watching the horizon. He observed her with no&#xD;
little curiosity for a few moments, and then sitting&#xD;
down beside her, took one of her hands in his, and&#xD;
gazed inquiringly into her face. He had seen her&#xD;
in many different phases before, but none resembled&#xD;
t~iis.&#xD;

"I was thinking, said .she, "why it is that women&#xD;
must be excluded from such honors and pursuIts as&#xD;
you are going to share to-night. Why should not*&#xD;
your enjoyment be increased byQur presence, instead&#xD;
of being selfishly reserved to yourselves? Do you&#xD;
think affection can be weakened by exercising the&#xD;
intellect, or are your festivals of such a nature that&#xD;
you fear her moral character will suffer from con-&#xD;
tamination?&#xD;
"If God has given us intellectual 'faculties, why&#xD;
should we not use them as well as you? What would&#xD;
be said of a young man, who, when his education is&#xD;
considered completed, should content himself xvith&#xD;
the frivolities of fashionable life? He would be re-&#xD;
garded as weak and effeminate, lacking those noble&#xD;
qualities of heart aid soul that lead to an honorable&#xD;
ambition, both for his own development and the&#xD;
world's good.&#xD;
"To stimulate a woman's affections, which is done&#xD;
by educating her into the belief that that is her only&#xD;
sphere, and provide her with no means of access to&#xD;
other channels to absorb her attention when the ob-&#xD;
ject of them is withdrawn, is to subject her to a stern&#xD;
ordeal of mental suffering. The mind must have&#xD;
food of some kind or it will become a prey to itself.&#xD;
We are reproached for being silly and weak~minded,&#xD;
because we spend so much time on dress, and study&#xD;
nothing but fashion, when, really, it is you who, have&#xD;
forced us to this kind of life, by giyirmg us no other&#xD;
means of relaxation and amusement. Even-the wo-.&#xD;

and diversion to spend an evening in mental enjoy-&#xD;
ments, where she would derive profit as well as&#xD;
pleasure.&#xD;
"Every organ is stamped with its own particular&#xD;
function, which another cannot usurp, and only as&#xD;
each is developed according to th~ law that governs&#xD;
it, can we expect pure rational enjoyment, or advance&#xD;
to perfection. Affection can no more take the place&#xD;
of in telle9t, than meat can take the place of drink.&#xD;
The two should be considered as compliments to&#xD;
each other, not substitutes for each other.&#xD;
"Mark how different the conversation when ad-&#xD;
dressed to a lady from that .to a gentleman. Even&#xD;
your friends this morning never thought of directing&#xD;
a remark to me. All that a woman is expected to&#xD;
be interested in or capable of appreciating is the&#xD;
merit or success of the last opera,-the most appro-&#xD;
priate dress to be worn to a party, or,~ if seriously&#xD;
inclined, the prospects~ of the last revival. When&#xD;
you come to those sublime ti~uths that un~iIerlie and&#xD;
uphold all this material world of ours,----t~zie knowl-&#xD;
edge of those laws that govern the plane ~s in their&#xD;
spheres, which sound the depths of the o~ean, and&#xD;
measure the distances of the fixed stars, ~ou club&#xD;
yourselves together as if God had been a~ narrow-&#xD;
minded as yourselves, and only created light enough&#xD;
to illuminate one~half of the world, leaving the other&#xD;
half in ~total darkness."&#xD;
Ernest was both amused and puzzled by this cx-&#xD;
tempore speech, which he could easily see by its&#xD;
earnestness of toije, a~id the deep revealing of those&#xD;
eyes so intently filed on his, into which had risen all&#xD;
&#xD;
the passion of her soul, that it was neither the out-&#xD;
growth of a momentary impulse, nor one of those&#xD;
transient, effervescent passages of her life, with&#xD;
which she often regaled him. Taking out his watch,&#xD;
and seeing it was time for him to go, he rose, saying&#xD;
to her caressingly, "Rosalind, as you are yet young&#xD;
&amp;amp;      and have such a fondness for literacy pursuits, why&#xD;
don't yoi~ devote to them a portion of your tin~e? I&#xD;
have formed too high an estimate of you to suppose&#xD;
you ambitious of mere worldly fame, and perhaps&#xD;
the assistance and. approval of your husband may&#xD;
atone for some of the honors and privileges you envy&#xD;
us, and I do not say, without just cause."&#xD;
She replied by a grateful smile, and he left her&#xD;
immediately. He was very conservative in his tastes&#xD;
and habits, and it had never occurred to him, as it&#xD;
never has to many other, men, that a woman could&#xD;
want anything more after her affections were satisfied.&#xD;
Nothing that game from hi~ wife was ever deenied&#xD;
unworthy of consideration, and there was so much&#xD;
of truth embodied in her remarks that he could not&#xD;
have thrust them aside if he would. He felt that&#xD;
there was not quite so much honor as is boasted in&#xD;
being styled the "lords of creation," and when&#xD;
greeted with applause and complimented with toasts,&#xD;
the sound of that, delicate but keen reproach stung&#xD;
his sensibilities, and he felt more as if he had done&#xD;
somemean and cowardly act that merited disgrace&#xD;
than one deserving praise. He coveted more the&#xD;
smiling approval of his wife than all these courtly&#xD;
honors.&#xD;
Rosalind never intended the personal rebuke she&#xD;

unwittingly administered. Not since her father's&#xD;
death had she taken any interest 'in her former&#xD;
studies, and her books still lay neglected on the&#xD;
shelves where they had heen last deposited before he&#xD;
was taken sick. Since her acquaintance with Ernest&#xD;
her mind hdA been engrossed with other subjects, and&#xD;
it was not until that morning, in Listening to the con-&#xD;
versation on her favorite topics, that her old passion&#xD;
for them revived. All the latent energies of those&#xD;
years burst forth in a single flame and with scorn&#xD;
and contempt she spurned~ the established usages that&#xD;
stood between her and the highest summit to which&#xD;
her capacities fitted her to ascend.&#xD;
Whon Ernest was gone she reproached herself foi~&#xD;
the sarcastic manner in which she had spoken to him,&#xD;
as if she meant to censure him for the fault of society.&#xD;
Yet was he not one of that society which by its tacit&#xD;
consent perpetrated these unjust customs that de-&#xD;
barred woman of~ rights and privileges coeval with&#xD;

withdraw her books from their long hiding places.&#xD;
What a throng of associations they brought! Here&#xD;
were Latin exercises, there were diagrams, and care-&#xD;
fully wrapped up so no dust or stain could reach&#xD;
them were some astronomical cuts, looking as neat&#xD;
and new as when her father brought them home.&#xD;
The afternoon glided imperceptibly away, and as her&#xD;

the i~ystic shades of the Past, which seemed as un~&#xD;
real as the joys of the Present, yet fascinating from&#xD;
their' strange power of inspiring reverence for what&#xD;
has passed away. Before her on the tahle lay an&#xD;
open writing-book in which she had completed the&#xD;
translation of an English story into . Frenc~h, and&#xD;
written at the close, " Voila ict fin de cette Itistoire!&#xD;
and Puss hasnodded her approval of every word of&#xD;
it." Beneath was written in her father's hand-writ-&#xD;
ing, looking so familiar that it seemed to bring him&#xD;
before her as if it were but yesterday,." Et tu l'a&#xD;
ecrit a merveilie, ma chere ,~ but think not that I&#xD;
shall accept the testimony of a stupid cat to decide&#xD;
its merits." How freshly it brought to mind the old&#xD;
dray cat whose presence was such a painful reminder&#xD;
of scenes that could never be recalled, but whose&#xD;
death had been mourned as if she were a thinking&#xD;
member of the household from her association with&#xD;
those scenes. She rested her face on her hands and&#xD;
gave herself up to reflection, in which position Er-&#xD;
nest surprised her. She looked up with an exclama-&#xD;
tion of joy as he removed her hands. "What t "&#xD;
said she, "home so so6n?" to which he replied&#xD;
laughing, "The time cannot have seemed very long.~&#xD;
if you call this soon, nearly midnight."&#xD;
* "It has been a very busy day with me and a&#xD;

mostly abo t the great party that is to come off&#xD;
'Thursday evening. To tell the truth, if it were not&#xD;
for the looks of the thing, I should rather stay at&#xD;
home,-what does it amount to? So much labor&#xD;
and trouble just for a few minutes of enjoyment if&#xD;
we are so fortunate, which is too often paid for by a&#xD;

and be admired. If fortunate enough to succeed in&#xD;
that she is happy for the time being I suppose; if&#xD;
not, look out. for a nervous headache. And you&#xD;
gentlemen, laugh in your sleeves to think we are&#xD;
such dunces as to have our heads turned with a little&#xD;
flattery. But how shall we amuse ourselves? lit is&#xD;
not expected we shall take part in any sensible con-&#xD;

"You will have a motive for going to Mrs. Lane's,&#xD;

and you will enjoy his conversation."&#xD;
"A precious little of it IL fear I shall have the&#xD;
privilege of enjoying, for he will collect around him&#xD;
a company of gentlemen; and if by chance a lady&#xD;
gets into the circle, he would perhaps remark that it&#xD;

them, with the varied scenes of pain and pleasure&#xD;
they had brought, so filled her mind as to chase the&#xD;
sleep from her pillow. At break of day she fell into&#xD;
an unquiet ~luinber when she returned in dreams to&#xD;
the happy hours of her childhood and was again&#xD;
little girl sitting on her father's knee, or coasting&#xD;
down hill with him for a companion. Then came&#xD;
confused images of fireside pleasures, playing with&#xD;
wax dolls, imaginary tea-parties, and calculating'&#xD;
eclipses; and lastly,' she saw her father an angel&#xD;
seraph beckoning to her to follow him. She essayed&#xD;
to rise but was held back by an invisible power.&#xD;
She opened her eyes and saw Ernest standing o~ver&#xD;

walk, returning to the chamber just in season to see&#xD;
the smile that flitted across her features, and the&#xD;
partial j~aising of the hand.&#xD;

"Holy and fervent love! had earth but rest&#xD;
For thee and thine, this world were all too fair!&#xD;
How could we thence be weaned to die without despair ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
iRosaliiid found much time~ to devote to her studies&#xD;
during the winter, in which, being occasionally&#xD;
assisted by her husband, she found a charm that dis-&#xD;
pelled many of those vain q~ieries she was so prone&#xD;
to enter into. That intellect was finding rest at last,&#xD;
for it was a rest to be satiated in its demands, no&#xD;
matter how much labor it cost the brain to follow&#xD;
that untiring will. Domestic duties might preSS&#xD;
upon her, or benevolent enterprises require her as-&#xD;
sistance, but nothing could usurp the paramount&#xD;
claims of her natu~x.~ upon that scicuce which, more&#xD;
than aught else, revealed the mystery of the world's&#xD;
creation, and reconciled her to the decree which has&#xD;
appointed unto all men to suffer, since into all is&#xD;
breathed a spark of the divine life whose omnipotent&#xD;
genius call5~ all these worlds into existence, and&#xD;
which will still exist when they shall cease ~o be.&#xD;
The sufferings of a few shoit years were swallowed&#xD;
up in the presence of the glorious eternity toward&#xD;
which all were hastening, and which was already be-&#xD;
ginning to dawn upon her as she threaded the sub-&#xD;
lime wonders so closely connecting the divine law&#xD;

subject to natural laws governing her organization,&#xD;
by obedience to which she could alone intelligently&#xD;

During Walter's next visit home in the summer&#xD;
vacation, James Morgan and his wife paid a visit to&#xD;
Orange Grove, with their little son, a sprightly babe&#xD;
of six months. Mary had a gre~t desire for her&#xD;
parents to see the little felloxV, thinking it possible&#xD;
her father might relent at the sight of the priceless&#xD;
treasure, possessing such uncommon merit in her&#xD;
eyes. As it would not do for her to go there, it was&#xD;
decided that Walter and Rosalind should take him&#xD;
to Mr. Kingl9y's, thus affording his wife an oppor-&#xD;
tunity to see him, whether he consented to it or not.&#xD;
They did so, and she was overjoyed, laughing and&#xD;
crying alternately as she fondled and kissed the babe&#xD;
again and again, while the little cherub kicked and&#xD;
crowed as if the whole world was bound to make&#xD;
him happy. Mr. Kingley received them coldly,&#xD;
taking no notice of the baby. He peeped suspiciously&#xD;

As they rose to leave Mrs. Kingley clung to the&#xD;
child with affectionate tenacity, when he spoke for&#xD;
the first time, addressing h~r,&#xD;
"Don't woman ,~ct so like a fool, let the young&#xD;
un go to his motIiei~."&#xD;
Althoiiigh Mary ~ad not expected her father to&#xD;
treat her with his f~ rmer indulgence, she did thiiik&#xD;
he would show som~ signs of lingering affection, and&#xD;
not until they returned and gave an account of their&#xD;
reception, did she realize how niuch she had calcu-&#xD;
hated on this unconscious mediator as the repairer of&#xD;
the breach between thQm. She now gave up every&#xD;
hope of reconciliation, and wheii Rosalind i~estOred&#xD;
to her her little charge, who immediately began to&#xD;
set up a clamor for his ~'ights, the sight of his mother&#xD;
having suddenly reminded him of his morning lunch,&#xD;
she withdrew to her chamber, and atter lulling&#xD;
him to sleep, gave way to a passionate flood of tears.&#xD;
She felt a sense of languor when her grief had&#xD;
spent its force, and, lying down by the side of her&#xD;
sleeping babe, a deep slumber soon came to her re~&#xD;
lief, which Rosaliiid thought best not to disturb when&#xD;
she entered the chamber to summon her to dinner.&#xD;
Finding the child awake, who was laughing and coo~&#xD;
ing gently, but not sufficiently loud to awaken the&#xD;
sleeper, she took him to the table where they had a&#xD;
merry time, showing ~he type of royalty to which&#xD;
homage is most readily given. The etiquette 6f the&#xD;
dinner table wa~ dispensed with in the presence of the&#xD;
unconscious stranger who was making his first debut&#xD;
&#xD;
at this family board. Rosalind tried to learn him to&#xD;
eat, and put some food in his mouth, for which, evP&#xD;
gently, he had no appetite, or he was so excited by&#xD;
his novel position, that he could not give his atten~&#xD;
tion to that duty. Finding himself the centre of&#xD;
attraction, as he looked from one to another of the&#xD;
group, he gave occasionally a leap and a bound,&#xD;
which excited their laughter, and in which he joined&#xD;
as heartily as any.&#xD;
M~ry awoke soon after, feeling greatly composed&#xD;
by the tranquilizing influences of steep, and inter~&#xD;
erupted their merriment by her appearance, at which&#xD;
he recovered his appetite, and the cimtomary honors&#xD;
of the table were soon resumed. James came the&#xD;
next day to take them home again, having left them&#xD;
the first time he was there at the urgent solicitation&#xD;
of Rosalind, which, however, he regretted before&#xD;
reaching his house. Desolate~enough it seemed with~&#xD;
out the two lights that had of late radiated it, and~&#xD;
he found food for reflection, at the thought of what&#xD;
was, and what might have been. Scarcely could that&#xD;
manly frame resist the gathering tears, as his soul&#xD;
ascended in praises and thanksgiving for the narrow&#xD;
escape from a life of degradation. a kiud Providence&#xD;
had vouchsafed tQ him.&#xD;
Honors and fame awaited him, but nothing could&#xD;
win him from the' side of his beloved Mary, where&#xD;
every evening was spent which could be spared from&#xD;
the pressure of businQss, being now admitted as a&#xD;
partner in the firm to which Walter first introduced&#xD;
him on that memorable day when he vowed before&#xD;
God never again to touch the intoxicating cup.&#xD;

The novel was quite neglected of la;te, yet not&#xD;
abandoned. Kate had contributed nothing towards&#xD;
it since the "magnificent affair of Syke's wedding '&#xD;
being now very much occupied during her leisure&#xD;
moments with a newly married couple, both of whom&#xD;
were ignorant of the first duties of housekeeping.&#xD;
Though an inexcusable fault in her eyes, "not&#xD;
knownn'" she said, "what any woman c9uld be&#xD;
thinking' of to bring up a girl in that way," her usual&#xD;
kindness of' heart prompted her to render them every&#xD;
assistance in her power. She had once lived in the&#xD;
family of the bride's mother, and thus was on famib&#xD;
jar terms, indulging in as much raillery as she pleased&#xD;
without givin g~ offence, which was just what suited&#xD;
her. If she tl~ought it showed a lack of common&#xD;

but there was an old croaker there, I don't know&#xD;

She sat there with her hands clinched, the corners of&#xD;
her mouth hanging' down, and her eyes lookm'&#xD;
straight into the fire as if all the light there was in&#xD;

~Iilly's mind had been wandering among other&#xD;
sceiies than the vekations of young house-keepers,&#xD;
and Kate soon left her to her own meditation~, not&#xD;
receiving any reply to her running remarks. She&#xD;
had watched the gorgeous sunset, until its flaming&#xD;
tints of crimson and gold contrasting with. the clear&#xD;
azure of the vault above had kindled in her soul that&#xD;
intense rapture which so abstracts it from the com~&#xD;
mon affairs of this work-day life as to turn to them&#xD;
again with reluctance. Wihlihgly would she have&#xD;
become a disembodied spirit, to soar away among&#xD;
those heavenly regions whore the miseries of this&#xD;
world could no longer pain the ear, and she might&#xD;
realize the ideal, whose fair proportions then rose&#xD;
before her miii'd's eye, not to be revealed in human&#xD;
language. Like the first rude sketch of the artist,&#xD;

&#xD;
her conceptions at that moment embraced the out-&#xD;
lines of a millennial st~itc, clearly comprehended by&#xD;
the inner sense, but not tangible to others.&#xD;
Gradually as tho shades of evening gathered&#xD;
around her, darker pictures of the poverty and&#xD;
wretchedness of life cast their shadows over these&#xD;
fair visions, and instead of wishing herself released&#xD;
from her earthly abode; she felt the~sublimity of a&#xD;
life that demanded, not rest,-not absolution from&#xD;
the trials of this world, but a devotion to 'its highest&#xD;
interests here.&#xD;
She thought of the thousands unto whom the light&#xD;
of day comes only as a dreaded tyrant, at whose&#xD;
approach the weary, worn out frame must bid adieu&#xD;
to its needed repose; of the multitude of children&#xD;
treading the paths of sin and vice, through want of&#xD;
a mother's tender care to guide them; of homes&#xD;
surrounded~y every physical comfort; made miser-&#xD;
able by the discord reigning x~ithin, and she thought&#xD;
of those also whose in fatuation on some favorite&#xD;
theme of pecuniary gain or xvorldly fame blinded&#xD;
them to the richness and beauty of this outward&#xD;
hifQ, thus voluntarily depriving themselves Qf those&#xD;
blessed influences which, in her poetic nature, were&#xD;
closely associated with all solki enjoyment and mdi-&#xD;
vidual perfection.&#xD;
t;~ose restless spirits, always discontented with their&#xD;
Mihly was never unhappy, neither was she one of&#xD;

middle age, could not look back with satisfaction&#xD;
upon a life devoted to no other interest than the&#xD;
trivial occupation of the unmarried woman. Retro-&#xD;

oven when engaged in the most philanthropic enter-&#xD;
pie; for whatever we may have done, our ideal, the&#xD;
key-note of aspiration, is still unattained. One of&#xD;
the greatest blessings of any occupation, is the little&#xD;
leisure it gives for reflection and regret. Repentance&#xD;
is good, and when the mind stops there, leaving the&#xD;
past to bury its dead, groat results follow. Regrets,&#xD;
whether with or without cause, should never be in-&#xD;
dulged in. The conscience becomes morbid, the&#xD;
intellect clouded, rind the mind is unfitted for the&#xD;
satisfactory performance of any duty or participa-&#xD;
tion in any enjoyment. To prevent this it nmst be&#xD;
supplied with other ~pod to fill the vacancy, and&#xD;
employ it, something which shall create an interest&#xD;
aside from the mere occupation. The matron of a&#xD;
hospital, or the care-taker of a family of ori~.ban&#xD;
children, finds a rational enjoyment the pleasures, of&#xD;
home could not yield unless her presence were&#xD;
needed there for something more than her society.&#xD;
Let the construction of the text be what it may,&#xD;
concerning laThr being ordained as a curse, it must&#xD;
be the conviction of every candid h~ind that it was&#xD;
ordained as a blessing from the begipuing of the&#xD;
world,----not that labor which consigns thousands to&#xD;
a cheerless life in crowded attics or sunless baso-&#xD;
ments every hour of the twenty-four, in order to&#xD;
ward off starvation from the door, but the healthful,&#xD;
stimulating exercise for both body and mind every&#xD;
iPdividual craves as the requisite of a sound physical&#xD;
and mental bodily development.&#xD;
Kate, in her rough, unpolished way, lived out this&#xD;
&#xD;
theory. She had a more serious vein of humor than&#xD;
was indicated by her trifling manner of conversation.&#xD;
Milly could detect in many a homely phrase and&#xD;
jesting remark, a depth of thought that suggested&#xD;
original ideas to her own reflections, and she never.&#xD;
wearied of her, if she did sometimes leave her to&#xD;
pursue her theme of discussion alone. She admired&#xD;
her unceasing activity, if sometimes culminating, for&#xD;
the sake of diversion, in the nonsensical affair of&#xD;
~" Syke's wedding," which might be of more value&#xD;
in enlivening sonic low-spirited invalid, than all her&#xD;
idle dreaming of a world renovated by a philosophy&#xD;
she could never expect to be put in practice. It was&#xD;
easy enough in the solitude of her chamber to dissect&#xD;
men's motives and analyze their main-springs of ac-&#xD;
tiol l)uiidmg up a logical basis of principles f6r the&#xD;
reconstruction of society Which would amelioi'ate&#xD;
some of these social evils, but let her take her theory&#xD;
outside, avid wluit was it? Most fitly expressed by&#xD;
Kate, a mere cobweb, the first contact with the world&#xD;
swept away. And thus she dreamed on, yet per-&#xD;
haps not idly. Every pure and elevating thought&#xD;
that comes into the mind is worthy of reception&#xD;
there, and should be welcomed as a heavenly guest&#xD;
leading us higher in aspiration until the subtle fet-&#xD;
ters that bijid us to a selfish ambition and the love of&#xD;
worldly approbation melt away in the approving&#xD;
smile of Him who created us to be heirs to his glo-&#xD;

Lilly was an active, playful child, but so still that&#xD;
she iiever disturbed any one. A frcqueat visitor at&#xD;

themselves with drawing birds, kittens and flowers,&#xD;
wheii her lips could only lisp their names. Ilaviiig&#xD;

to understand that they were at her own disposal as&#xD;
her private property, which afforded un bonn dod de-&#xD;

sented whh a flower, sometimes with a bouquet. An&#xD;
aged man, who had apparently seen iburseore years,&#xD;
one day made his appearance at the gate when she&#xD;
was busily engaged with her watering pot. Her&#xD;
father pointe~1 him out to her and, dropping the pot,&#xD;
slie' hastily gathered a pansy and a daisy to Dresent&#xD;
to him. The old man was deeply moved by th&amp;amp;&#xD;

friendliness of the little gift, and turning to Mr.&#xD;
Livingston said, "If every body had been as consid-&#xD;
crate as that little child, I should not be where I am.&#xD;
When any body begins to go down, the world keeps&#xD;
pushing him down, not even deigning to give him so&#xD;
much as a daisy to cheer him."&#xD;
"Qh the little darling , what a blessed angel you&#xD;
are," said Kate, as she ran out and snatched her&#xD;
from her father's arms on their return from an even-&#xD;
ing ride, and sallying into the kitchen, kept up such&#xD;
a constant chatter and laugh, that when Milly took&#xD;
her to prepare for her night's rest, the child was so&#xD;
excited she did. not go to sleep until midnight.&#xD;
Talking with h~r eyes more than with her hips, Kate&#xD;
liked to watch their sparkle when any thing pleased&#xD;
her. And~ then she had such cunning little hands,&#xD;
neither chubby nor lank, but just full enough to&#xD;

Walter came home that day, having completed his&#xD;

permanently.&#xD;
A curious little adventure happened that afternoon&#xD;
as he and Mr. Livingston were out looking at a beau-&#xD;

meet an old classmate of the latter, whom he had&#xD;

to an. invitation to call at his house. With a mis~&#xD;
chievous twinkle in his, eyes which, however, was&#xD;
unperceived by his friend, he informed him that he&#xD;
had two very rare specimens of the rose end lily, lie&#xD;
would be very 11~appy to introduce to him. I~~pa-&#xD;

called (hat evei~ ing, just after Lilly was taken . up&#xD;

Ernest hastened after them, fearing it might be too&#xD;
late for, Lilly to appear in her most interesting mann&#xD;
ncr, as it ,was getting late and she might be sleepy.&#xD;
On the contrary, he thought she never looked so&#xD;
pretty before. The excitement had imparted a deli-&#xD;
cate flush to her cheeks, and her eyes, which re-&#xD;
sembled his in expression, were sparkling with hap-&#xD;
piness running over. Taking her in one arm and&#xD;
giving his wife the other, he took them to the parlor&#xD;
and after introducing them, said, " These are my&#xD;
Rose and Lilly, and iii granting your desire to in-&#xD;
form you where you may be able to obtain more of&#xD;
the same species, I have only to say that profiting by&#xD;
my experience, you must select your rose from the&#xD;
purest love, and you will never feel its thorn, and&#xD;
fairer than any hot-house plant will bloom the lily&#xD;
of your household." The bachelor friend was raIh~r&#xD;
abashed, but enjoy&amp;amp;l the joke. Whether this little&#xD;
incident awakened emotions that had long been slum-&#xD;
bering, or Milly's pleasant face and unassuming ways&#xD;
alone attracted him, it was evident by his frequent.&#xD;
calls before leaving the city and' inquiries after her&#xD;
when not present, that he felt an uiiusual interest in&#xD;
&#xD;
her. What might have been, but for Lilly whom no&#xD;
stranger could supplant in her affpctions, romance&#xD;
doth not say. She was too happy now to desire any&#xD;
change.&#xD;
When Lilly was three years old her father painted&#xD;
her picture, which was a source of great delight to&#xD;
them both. She would steal softly into his room and&#xD;
look over his shoulder when busily engaged upon it,&#xD;
and without interrupting him by a single xvord stand&#xD;
perhaps half an hour, when, giving him a kiss and&#xD;
receiving one in return, she glided out as still as she&#xD;
glided in.&#xD;

Before Walter commenced his professional career&#xD;
as a lawyer, he started on a journey that had been&#xD;
a subject of his thoughts for many years, intending&#xD;
to visit the tomb of Washington, the Capitol of his&#xD;
country, and other places of interest at the South.&#xD;
He was a very enthusiastic politician for one of such&#xD;
precise ideas of morality, much more so than Ernest&#xD;
who took very little interest in political affairs gen-&#xD;
erally. They often discussed the leading topics of'&#xD;
the day, upon which the latter kept himself well in-&#xD;
formed, but he did not care so much to enter into&#xD;
the arena of debate as Walter. He liked argument,&#xD;
liked to probe the depth of every measure to see if&#xD;
it rested on a sure foundation, and was unsparing in&#xD;
his criticisms if it did not. Party spirit thou ran&#xD;
high, and a new element was just beginning to tinge&#xD;
the waters of civil commotion, which was soon to&#xD;
sink all other issues in its transcendent importance.&#xD;
Already Mammon began to tremble, and priestly ar~&#xD;

Although Walter had studied. his political creed&#xD;
under the most conservative teachings, his religious&#xD;
convictions had not parted with that cardinal point&#xD;
Which i~ the unquestioned heritage of the Protestant&#xD;
faith, the right of private judgment. It would have&#xD;
given liini no pleasure, and it would have been no&#xD;
inducement to travel anywhere under a restriction&#xD;
of any opinion he might hold on any sukicet that&#xD;
came under his observation.&#xD;
On reaching Washington, meeting an old acquaint-&#xD;

Patriot and Defender of his country, and ranibled&#xD;
over the OTOUIidS so often pressed by his weary feet.&#xD;
Descending a slope that led to the spring in a se-&#xD;
questered, b~it most enchanting and romantic spot,&#xD;
he sat down to ~cst and feast his soul upon a beauty&#xD;
of natural scenery that, aside from the interest it&#xD;
inspired by its association with the illustrious dead,&#xD;
was well calculated to lead the thoughts from the&#xD;
narrow range of the present over the boundless fields&#xD;
of the past, and the ungathered harvests yet to be&#xD;
garnered in the golden sheaves of the future. He&#xD;

foundation of a nation stretching its arms over the&#xD;
oppressed of all lands that they should find here an&#xD;
asylum and a home, unmolested in the enjoyment of&#xD;
freedom of conscience, and he grew in of&#xD;
himself and lodged to be another Washington. Full&#xD;
of these reflections lie left this favorite Mecca of the&#xD;
Americans, undisturbed in his delightful reverie un-&#xD;
til he reached his hotel in Washington. There he&#xD;
overheard two gentlemen discussing a slave auction&#xD;
that was to take place the next day, one of whom&#xD;
was lately from the North and apparently a novice&#xD;
in such masters, to whom the other w~as giving in-&#xD;
structions hoxv to proceed to secure a good bargain&#xD;
,in the pound of human flesh. His revolting details&#xD;
of l~ersollai exaiiinations, and the heartlessness with&#xD;
which lie described the shrewdness necessary to elude&#xD;
the deceptions of the slave-trader on the one hand,&#xD;
and the pretended sensibilities of his victims on the&#xD;
other, clashed greatly with Walter's ideas of the&#xD;
sacredness of. humanity.&#xD;
The next clay he attended the sale, which was not&#xD;
calculated to allay his excited feelings. J~Ie saw there&#xD;
beauty, that the 'aristocratic circles of hi~ native city&#xD;
might envy ; children whose saddened c untenances&#xD;
indicated the weight of years rather than the buoy-&#xD;
*anc.y of childhood; aged men and women, whose&#xD;
bowed heads betokened the utter Qespair of their&#xD;
hearts. Around them was a motley crew, mostly&#xD;
vulgar and brutal; yet occasionally. one of gentle-&#xD;
manly bearing stood .a little apart like himself, as if&#xD;
ashamed, and' disgusted at this nefarious exhibition&#xD;
of depraved passions and filthy lucre. foremost t&#xD;
&#xD;
e.&#xD;
&#xD;
among the latter class was th~ prospective Northern&#xD;
slaveholder, shrinking a little from the unwelcome&#xD;
task before him,-unWelCoinC, because the Northern&#xD;
prejudices against the system instilled into him&#xD;
among the granite hills of his native state wore not&#xD;
quite conquered, yet bearing on his brow the well&#xD;
defined outlines of a dogged perseverance when the&#xD;
Yankee's love of money should overpower the nobler&#xD;
instincts of the soul. lie bid off at an exorbitant&#xD;
price a beautiful Quaciroon, not the best investment&#xD;
of money, which was of little moment just now, as&#xD;
he had fixed upon her, at any price, for a present to&#xD;
his young bride;' but retribution soon followed them&#xD;
both, for the Quadroon became the fire-brand of do-&#xD;
mestic discord. The sale went on very much like&#xD;
our sales of cattle and swine, with the exception of&#xD;
a more barbarous set of tradesmen.&#xD;
When Walter returned to his hotel he made some&#xD;
remarks upon the revolting cectacle he had wit-&#xD;
nessed, and drew some disparaging comparisons of&#xD;
this inhuman tr~ffio with the theory of our demo-&#xD;
cratic institutions and religious professions, which'&#xD;
stirred the chivalric blood of the hot-headed Soi4hron.&#xD;
"You'd better look out, young man, how you come&#xD;
here to meddle with our institutions. They are our&#xD;
right, and we will have none of your Northern inter~&#xD;
ference," said a well-dressed sprig of the Southern&#xD;
aristocracy.&#xD;
"I did not come her6 to meddle with your insti~&#xD;

"I fight no duels," calmly replied Walter, "the&#xD;
cause that descends to sncli low means for its defence&#xD;
shows the most convincing proof of its own weak-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
A tumultuous roar of voices now succeeded. The&#xD;
slave traders who had resorted thither after the auc-&#xD;
tion, inflamed with whiskey, made use of the most&#xD;
obscene language that ever greeted his ears, hide-&#xD;
pendent of the epithets applied to himself.&#xD;
" Set him on a rail and give him a right smart&#xD;
treat of our hospitality," drawled out a thick set,&#xD;
low-browed, savage looking, tobacco chewing repro-&#xD;
sentative of the "sacred" soil of Virginia, who, no&#xD;
doubt, would faithfully execute any deed of that na~&#xD;
ture imposed upon him.&#xD;
"He I)rates about Washington as if that was any&#xD;
thing to us. He was an old fool that he didn't get&#xD;
his old woman from your cussed North, instead of&#xD;
humoring their spleen. That's where he missed it,&#xD;

and the nigger, but we shall have 'em yet tighter 'n&#xD;
&#xD;
a vice, then we'll see 'em squirm. Our plans are all&#xD;
fixed."&#xD;
This defiant speech of one of the cotton lords&#xD;
was followed by a roar of exultant laughter, and a&#xD;
knowing shake of the head of one of the lower class&#xD;
as he called out to a craven looking huckster stand-&#xD;
ing in the door,&#xD;
"You woi~ked the card slick James when you got&#xD;
your nigger wench from the North, and there wan't&#xD;

right hard on you when she run away, hem' the only&#xD;
one 'you ever owned, you might a' raised a right&#xD;
smart stock from her, and she never was wuth nothing'&#xD;

Walter was on tl4c point of asking a question or&#xD;
two here, but thelandlord managed to draw him one&#xD;
side and besought him to leave as soon as ho could&#xD;
or they would both get into trouble. He had bean&#xD;
witness of too many such altercations to be unmind-&#xD;
ful of their results. Walter had no desire to stop&#xD;
longer among such society and he hastened away&#xD;
disgusted and disheartened by what he had seen and&#xD;
heard in the heart of the nation. It so happened&#xD;
that before he left the precincts of slave-dom, he was&#xD;
the witness of another auction. This was a more&#xD;
private sale, being the bankrupt stock of an indivi&amp;amp;&#xD;
ual lately deceased. He was an unusually indulgent&#xD;
master, and the grief and lamentation of the slaves&#xD;
as they were put up was heart-rending. lore was a&#xD;

Walter was disappointed in the sympathy and en-&#xD;
couragemen.t he expected to meet with in the social&#xD;
and religious world. Friends stood aloof, and the&#xD;
church looked with suspicion upon any innovation&#xD;
calculated to raise excitement. Previous to this&#xD;
time "order reigned in Warsaw." Theological dis-&#xD;
cussion was lulled, and if the same animosity existed&#xD;
between the sects, it was considered the wiser course&#xD;
to let each pursue its own path, trusting to the&#xD;
mercy of God for its conversion, rather Than protract&#xD;
such useless controversies.&#xD;

that which binds individuals together in a religious&#xD;

deeds of kindness which should entitle them to our&#xD;
life-long gratitude, are not to be parted. from without&#xD;

social standing was measured by allegiance to certain&#xD;

836             A TAtE OP THE&#xD;
popular wave of opposition, and maiiy of those wL~&#xD;
did, lacked the discretion a few years of experience&#xD;
in dealing with the prejudices of the times would&#xD;
have' taught them hat much more of the evil exist-&#xD;
ing in the world is perpetuated by thoughtlessness,&#xD;
particularly among the masses, than by a deliberate&#xD;
p~1rpose to commit a wrong. Although prejudices&#xD;
arc not to be disarmed by soft words, nor truths&#xD;
bluntly spoken to be dependent for success on the&#xD;
silver tongues that utter them, there is a certain in-&#xD;
ward perception of human nature which sees in the&#xD;
masses a confused mixture of noble purposes and in-&#xD;
consistent vagaries, causing them to vacillate between&#xD;
the casual glearPs of some rising star of millenial&#xD;
glory on the one side, and superstitious bigotry for&#xD;
some ancient relic of heathendom on the other, and&#xD;
gathers their unorganized impulses into a cohscious-&#xD;
ness of the merits and demands of an idea which&#xD;
stretches beyond the present into a future that shall&#xD;
actualize our conceptions, thus reachiiig the intu~&#xD;
itions when reason would reject it as a delusion.&#xD;
Another tendency to neutralize the pi~ogress of&#xD;
a reform is that spirit of timidity in a certain eJass of&#xD;
persons who recognize its beneficent objects, which&#xD;
leads them to ignore it out of deference to the opin-&#xD;
,ion that suggests the possibility of error . because&#xD;
others have erred before them, and that the 'fallibility&#xD;
of human nature, out of charity for itself, should&#xD;
attempt nothing higher than it has been found able&#xD;
to attain, forgetful that it was under th6 inspiration&#xD;
of their own. great thought that Galileo and Luther&#xD;
severally pressed forWard to challenge th~ world to a&#xD;

criticism of its merits, and crystallized it into an act&#xD;
which has crowned their names with honor for the&#xD;
fidelity with which they gave expression to God's&#xD;
immortal purpose as it was revealed unto them, and&#xD;
for its benefit to the human race.&#xD;
If charity is commended as the greatest of christian&#xD;
graces, it xvas never intended that it should be per-&#xD;
verted into a cloak for unrighteousness, or that it&#xD;
should exert so tolerant a sway as to lose sight of the&#xD;
principle at stake. The mistaken views of the well-&#xD;
meaning, or the sensitiveness of near and dear friends&#xD;
afford no palliation of a great wrong which is upheld&#xD;
by the powerful and influential, and toward which&#xD;
they contribute their influence; being no less oppres-&#xD;
sive to its victims because unintentionally or bliiidly&#xD;
sanctioned.&#xD;
Mrs. Claremont's brilliant hopes and anticipations&#xD;
in which she had indulged with all the fondness of&#xD;
maternal pride were thus to be dashed to the ground&#xD;
*    at the beginning of his career. She had irnver cov-&#xD;
eted honors or fame for the sake ~f reputation, but&#xD;
with that honest love of approbation which courts&#xD;
the applause of the wise and virtuous, she had looked&#xD;
forward t6 a future wheil Walter should be an orna-&#xD;
*     ment to his profession, and his moral integrity and&#xD;
manly independence win greater laurels still. All&#xD;
this she lived to see, but only with anointed vision.&#xD;
From worldly eyes was hidden the immortal wreath&#xD;

waiting to bear in grateful homage to the coronation.&#xD;

sublime inspiration of an jdea, but it is not so easy&#xD;
to disregard the feelings of a beloved friend, partic.&#xD;
ularly when the apathy of others gives rise to a feeb&#xD;
ing of isolation especially desirous of their sympathy,&#xD;
and Walter was so accustomed to his mother's en~&#xD;
encouraging smile that it seemed almost impious to&#xD;
expect a blessing upon any effort which she disap-&#xD;
*proved.&#xD;
Months rolled on, increasing, rather than diminish-&#xD;
ing the trials of both mother and son, and casting a&#xD;
shadow over the whole family. No reproachful&#xD;
words were ever uttered between them. They man-&#xD;
ifested the same tenderness for each other, but the&#xD;
barrier of prescribed opinions chilled the gushing&#xD;
warmth of their souls.&#xD;
From the first, Walter had dreaded the dissent&#xD;
from his views he felt sure to encounter with Ernest.&#xD;
Though oftimes differing in mere matters of opinion,&#xD;
there had never been any radical difference of prin~&#xD;
V ciples between them, and Walter had generally de-&#xD;
ferred to him as being older and having more ex-&#xD;
perience.&#xD;
Ernest was n~ re tenacious of the established or-&#xD;
der of things, an sought to introduce the new by&#xD;
preserving the o d, instead of destroying the, old to&#xD;
put the new in its place. He had unbounded rever-&#xD;
ence for man in whatever position he stood,- whether&#xD;
high 6r low.&#xD;
Walter reverenced m~an, but he reverenced princi-&#xD;
pie more. Whatever the position of the maix, if&#xD;
principles were disregarded, ho should be called to&#xD;
account, because in them xve~e embodied the rights&#xD;
&#xD;
of the individual which are apt to be lost sight of in&#xD;
a collective capacity which regards only the rights of&#xD;
the majority~&#xD;
The vieWs of Ernest accorded generally with Mrs.&#xD;
Claremont, but he was more practical in his belief of&#xD;
the supremacy of conscience over all matters of&#xD;
opinion, iiever do4ibting that fidelity to it would&#xD;
eventually lead a person into the right path, whatever.&#xD;
errors he might for a time embrace. He believed it&#xD;
to be a vital article of the Protestant i~aith, and a&#xD;
right which has existed from the foundation of the&#xD;
world, subject to no censorship from any human tri-&#xD;
bunal, and therefore amenable to God alone. His&#xD;
varied experience. in contact with all classes of so-&#xD;
ciety, of every shade of opinion, and all creeds 6f&#xD;
religious faith, had taught him to search farther than&#xD;
mere professions for the true life of the soul; and&#xD;
he learned to regard every human being, however&#xD;
degraded in person or erroneous in theory, as a spark&#xD;
of the divine intelligence, whose absolute sovereignty&#xD;
in all inattevs of thought none can question. He&#xD;
had too much faith in Walter's moral perceptions&#xD;
and sound judgment to harbor any fear that he&#xD;
would embrace any serious fallacy of reasoning or&#xD;
unwise method of action, and never did he stand so&#xD;
hi~h in his estimation as imow. Knowing the sacrifice&#xD;
of feeling it must have cost him to adhere to his&#xD;
present convictions of right, he manifested all the&#xD;
sympathy in his power,. which-was deeply touching&#xD;
to Walter. Being a man of few words,, it was very&#xD;
little he said upon the su1~ject, as they did not agreo~&#xD;
but his manner spoke louder than words.&#xD;

A TALE 01? THE&#xD;
&#xD;
Rosalirid's enthusiastic soul was just adapted to&#xD;
the* reception of these radical ideas, but it was little&#xD;
she said. With that delicate instinct which swayed&#xD;
them all she made no allusion to her mother's oppo~&#xD;
sition, not even to her husband. All felt that a&#xD;
shadow was resting over their happiness and none&#xD;
liked to allude to it. Even little Lilly seemed to&#xD;
comprehend the changes in the family atmosphere,&#xD;
and prattled less than formerly,-perhaps because&#xD;
the repressed buoyancy of their spirits failed to draw&#xD;
her out. Nestled in her father's arms she would&#xD;
sometimes sit a whole hour in the. evening perfectly,&#xD;
quiet save when he caressed h~r and brought into&#xD;
her eyes a radiant gush of happiness, when she would&#xD;
look around the room from one to another to see if&#xD;
they shared it, which of course they did for her sake.&#xD;
Doubts and fears arose to perplex the young m~n 's&#xD;
soul. "had I not better give it up," said he to&#xD;
himself; "is it iiot a filial duty I owe to my mother&#xD;
to regard her feelings ~n the matter? Is it; not a re-&#xD;
sponsibility which rests on the church alone?&#xD;
Leaving his meal untasted he arose from the tea.&#xD;
table and withdrew to his chamber. After pacing&#xD;
the floor for a few in~ments, he sat down by the wiii-&#xD;
dow, mechanically turning the pages of a Bible that&#xD;
lay open before him on a table near. Chancing&#xD;
to glance at its contents his eyes rested on the pas-&#xD;
sage, "Whoso loveth father or mother more than&#xD;
me is not worthy of me."&#xD;
A iiew meaning suddenly emanated from those&#xD;
simple words, word~ that were as familiar to his ears&#xD;
as their own family names, and yet never arrested&#xD;

his attention before. They applied so pointedly to&#xD;
his own case that all doubts fled, and his future&#xD;
course was immediately decided on, in which he&#xD;
never wavered for another moment. By the sacrifices&#xD;
he was ready to make must his devotion be tested.&#xD;
Rosalind entered his chamber that afternoon but&#xD;
he took no notice of her presence. 'He sat at the&#xD;
table with his head bowed on his hands, and seeing&#xD;
that he was beyond the reach of human sympathy&#xD;
she left a kiss on his brow and silently withdrew.&#xD;
When she heard his elastic step on the stair and saw&#xD;
the cheerfLd smile with which his face was lighted as&#xD;
K     -he entered the parlor and met his mother's glance&#xD;
K&#xD;
with more confiding assurance than he had done th~t&#xD;
day, she exchanged enquiring glances with her hus-&#xD;
band who was equally surprised at the change he as&#xD;
quickly observed.&#xD;
Mrs. CIaremo~it had experienced ~s restless and&#xD;
painful day as Walter, which was someWhat relieved&#xD;
by this momentary recurrence of his wanted buoy.&#xD;
5    ancy of spirits; but at~ the same time she felt an in-&#xD;
explicable sense of uneasiness and anxiety as he sat&#xD;
down beside her. She longed for the familiar inter-&#xD;
change of congenial sentiments which had formerly&#xD;
drawn their spirits together as one, and something&#xD;
within her queried whether in reality they were so&#xD;
far apart now. The harshness with which a new&#xD;
idea ever grates qn the settled habits of the inin4&#xD;
wa~ beginning.to wear off as she became accustomed&#xD;
to an unvarnished' statement of facts, so that uncon-&#xD;

There is always in the wilder and uncultivated&#xD;
mass of society a class ready to he attracted to any&#xD;

every reform an anomalous, disreputable character,.&#xD;
repulsive to the staid habits and fixed principals of a&#xD;
large body of people who would otherwise flock to&#xD;
the same standard, and which excites the derision of&#xD;
a respectable and influential, but superfici'al order of&#xD;
literary genius. It generally requires a mind of&#xD;
more than ordinary patience of investigation, and of&#xD;
rare independence and strength of will to sift, the&#xD;
question so thoroughly as to detect the wheat from&#xD;
the chaff when ready to meet it.&#xD;
Mrs. Claremont had reached the point where she&#xD;
could recognize the principle that first actuated Wal-&#xD;
"fanatical&#xD;
ter, but she could not tolerate the      disor-&#xD;
ganizers" as they were termed, on the one* side;&#xD;
and the low, motley crew on the other, with whom&#xD;
he was thus brought into close communion. She for&#xD;
got that Christ called his followers from the despised&#xD;
&#xD;
rabble of this world as well as from the devoted Sauls&#xD;
of tIme established church.&#xD;
On retiring to rest that night she. had a singular&#xD;
eam,-one that impressed her with a ,strange - viv-&#xD;
idness of reality. She thought that she was a slave,&#xD;
and had been sold away from her mother. All the&#xD;
agony she had ever known, compressed into one mo-&#xD;
ment, could not equal what she suffered for two&#xD;
hours when she lay sobbing convulsively on her&#xD;
mother's breast, with her master standing by, ready&#xD;
to grasp her at any moment. At last he bade her&#xD;
rm~e. She looked out at the window where the moon.&#xD;
was shining brightly as if in mockery of her wo, and&#xD;
the trees were waving gracefully in the calm beauty&#xD;
of the evening's delightful solitude regardless of her&#xD;
suffering.&#xD;
She was ready to curse the God who gave her hf9,&#xD;
and then looked complacently on the misery it&#xD;
brought her without interposing an avenging lmamA,&#xD;
when she felt the touch of her master's hand on her&#xD;
arm and bade him desist at his peril. The burning&#xD;
indignation with which she shrunk from his touch&#xD;
and defied him as if her soul were on fire, awoke her.&#xD;
There she lay with no other sensation tbau. that of&#xD;
awaking from peaceful sluniber,-no startling emo-&#xD;
K      tion, no hurried breathing, the usual accompaniment&#xD;
of such nightmare dreams disturbed her, but she&#xD;
could not rid herself of the awful, frenzied despera-&#xD;
tion with which her Anglo-Saxon blood rose in re-&#xD;
volt, contrasting it with the unrevengeful submission&#xD;
of the African to centuries of oppression, and the&#xD;
sublime fervor of his religious nature with that&#xD;

She now made the slave's case her own, which she&#xD;

pertaining to some far o~'f race which imposed no&#xD;
personal responsibility, without seeking th ascertain&#xD;
the measure of the nation's guilt, or the connection&#xD;

"Get but the Truth once uttered, and 'tis like&#xD;
A star new-born, that drops into its place,&#xD;
And which, once circling in its placid round,&#xD;
Not all the tumults of the earth can shake."&#xD;
Unable to sleep any more, Mrs. Claremont arose&#xD;
very early the next morning. She was impatient to&#xD;
Walter, and yet scarcely knew how to meet him.&#xD;
to atone for her lack of sympathy at the&#xD;
moment he most needed it, not knowing th~t the joy&#xD;
of his new-born faith was greater than he could de-&#xD;
rive from any favor this world could dispense, yet so&#xD;
softening in its tenderness as to be doubly apprecia-&#xD;
tive of the faintest ray of human cheer.&#xD;
He had reached that spiritual height where com-&#xD;
miseration for the blindness of those who sought to&#xD;
prison an idea swept away every other feeling;&#xD;
and for them, not for.himself, he breathed in earnest&#xD;
prayer that the divine effulgence of infinite Love&#xD;
might penetrate the darkness and lead them unto&#xD;
that peace which would make them one with God,&#xD;
ing their souls with the heavenly manna which&#xD;
comet from above and is sufficient for all things.&#xD;

CONNECTICUT.            347&#xD;
&#xD;
Having passed the night in the peacePul repose&#xD;
of a quiet conscience he arose unusually early and&#xD;
went out in the orchard to inhale the ~'ragraiiee of the&#xD;
fresh morning air, laden with the od cjrs of flower and&#xD;
fruit, tho sweet scented clover and the newly mown&#xD;
hayalI Mw baptised in one common faith by unseen&#xD;
agencies that needed not the laying on of earthly&#xD;
hands. Filled with the spirit of adoration the whole&#xD;
earth looked to him as if kneeling before its Maker&#xD;
in grateful praise fdr the, blessings of the night in&#xD;
which he was ready to join.&#xD;
Presently the sound of a footstep behind him dis-&#xD;
turbed his devotions, and looking round he saw 'his&#xD;
mother approaching with such a benignant smile in&#xD;
her eyes, that ere he was aware, his arms encircled&#xD;
her neck.&#xD;
"Mother! "&#xD;
" Walter!"&#xD;
Not another word was said. Soul met soul, and&#xD;
language was needless. They walked into the house&#xD;
in silence where they found the rest of the family&#xD;
already astir. Unknown to themselves Ernest was&#xD;
an observer of the scene as lie looked from his chain-&#xD;
ber window and called Rosalind, but she was not&#xD;
quick enough. At breakfast an indescribable joy&#xD;
pervaded the -whole family as if a great shadow had&#xD;
been suddenly lifted, which was no less a trouble that&#xD;
it was only a shadow. All felt the change but none&#xD;
knew huiow it happened. Even Lilly seemed to com-&#xD;
prehend it who slid down from her chair, and going&#xD;
to Walter, put her: hand, on his knee, and looked up&#xD;
into his face, as much as to say, "Can't you tell me&#xD;
what makes you so happy?"&#xD;
&#xD;
~lI&#xD;
&#xD;
Whore now were all the heresies she had attributed&#xD;
to Walter? banished, like a noon-day illusion. Now&#xD;
that Mrs. Claremont' had embraced the "spirit that&#xD;
giveth life," she could se~ how "the letter killeth."&#xD;
She saw that the Sabbath, which was made for man,&#xD;
could not be too sacred to plead for the rights of&#xD;
~ ,   man; that the religion which was too sacred to ad-&#xD;
mit the humblest to its communion as children of&#xD;
the same Father, and therefore entitled to the same&#xD;
birthright as the highest, was not worthy the name,&#xD;
of Christian, whatever good works it might perform.&#xD;
"Did not even the Pharisees the same?" "Not&#xD;
every one that saith unto me Lord, lord, but he who&#xD;
doeth the will of the Father shall be my 'disciple."&#xD;
What is the will of the Father? Not merely to&#xD;
visit the widows and the fatherless in their affliction,&#xD;
but to undo the heavy burdens and let the oppressed&#xD;
go free. What is faith without works? Of what&#xD;
use the daily prayer to God that righteousness shall&#xD;
prevail through all the earth, without making use of&#xD;
the human instrumentalities he has ordained for its&#xD;
accomplishment?&#xD;
In the following autumn Walter visited the classic&#xD;
ground of his Alma Mater. On the first evening of&#xD;
his arrival a large meeting was held to discuss those&#xD;
very questions to which he had consecrated his life,&#xD;
awakening no little interest in the community, for&#xD;
excitement ways then at its height.&#xD;
The reverend doctors of divinity, and the honor-&#xD;
ables of every profession met in solemn convocation&#xD;
to decide what limit should be assigned to free speech,&#xD;
and how far a man should be amenable to God in&#xD;

yielding to the dictates of his conscience. IRev. Dr.&#xD;
Southron open d the meeting with prayer, which&#xD;
consisted more i ii a statement of its objects than an&#xD;
approach to the throne of Qrace for wisdom to be&#xD;
guided in an im partial verdict, after which he made&#xD;
.a short address, taking for his text, "The powers&#xD;
that be are ordained of God," inculcating the prin-&#xD;
ciple that governments are divine, and resistance to&#xD;
them a crime against God and man. Then he pro-&#xD;
ceeded to show what constitutes rebellion against a&#xD;
government, and what course should be pursued to-&#xD;
ward thcse. who stirred up sedition and revolt. "If&#xD;
we let them go on," said he, "what anarchy and&#xD;
confusion will follow, divisions in the church, dissen-&#xD;
sions in society, and the overthrow of all law." ile&#xD;
closed with an argument in defence of slavery based&#xD;
on the Bible, beginning with the patriarch Abraham&#xD;
and the Mosaic law, and ending with the since thread-&#xD;
bare .tale of Paul and Onesimus under the new dis-&#xD;
pensation.&#xD;
This was going rather farther than most of the&#xD;
audience were ready to endorse, not being yet quite&#xD;
enough indoctrinated into the southern catechism to&#xD;
answer in the affirmative: "Is not the chief end of&#xD;
* man to glorify God by enslaving his brother so that&#xD;
he may also teach him to glorify him?"&#xD;
* They believed in submission to the laws whether&#xD;
good or bad, in standing by the country, whether&#xD;
right or wrong, but it was a bitter pill to swallow on&#xD;
the soil of the Pilgrims, concocted of the alien, idea&#xD;
that a ten-fold wors6 oppression than that they sought&#xD;
~o escape should promote the very . end. they had in&#xD;
&#xD;
view. There was a slight murmur of disapprobation&#xD;
K    when he took his seat, which; however, was quickly&#xD;
supprQssed as the silver tongued orator, whose name&#xD;
was a synonym for all that was chaste in language&#xD;
and classical in style, arose to defend the Union.&#xD;
lie sped an arrow's flight beyond the comprehension&#xD;
of the people who could see very little connection&#xD;
between the elements of that massive structure ~nd&#xD;
the consequences likely to result from the unlimited&#xD;
exercise of free speech. He was, however, vocifer-&#xD;
ously cheered, as every word coming from his lips&#xD;
would be, if it had been expressed in an unintelli-&#xD;
7   gible language. At the close of his remarks, another&#xD;
gentleman arose who took exception to some of his'&#xD;
sentiments.&#xD;
"There was no need," he said, "to defend the&#xD;
Union, for that rested on a foundation as sure as the&#xD;
everlasting hills. Our fathers made it, and we have&#xD;
no right to question its integrity, or doubt its stabile.&#xD;
ity. Let us not harbor a thought that it can be rent&#xD;
asunder by any force brought to* assail it, the possi-&#xD;
bility of which it would be a, sin to admit, a libel on&#xD;
the wisdom of our fathers!"&#xD;
A strong feeling of dissatisfaction was here mani-&#xD;
fested by the audience, who, though they in no wise&#xD;
differed from the last speaker, would not tolerate the&#xD;
appearance of dissent from any sentiment advanced&#xD;
by their pet orator. The latter was also evidently&#xD;
misunderstood, for his remarks were intefided more&#xD;
as a rhetorical flourish to pass encomiums on those&#xD;
who framed the Union and present them as models&#xD;
for the present generation to follow, than to intimate&#xD;

True, he was in favor of making free speech an&#xD;
indictable offense, but his argument was so plausibly&#xD;
worded as to make it appear something else than an&#xD;
open denial of the constitutional right of freedom of&#xD;
speech. His intentions might not have been bad,&#xD;
nothing more nor less than to preserve the fraternal&#xD;
feeling he supposed to exist between the north and&#xD;
south, without which the ship of state would floun-&#xD;
der, and all these magnificent proportions of an over~&#xD;
arching striictu re which stretched forth its friendly&#xD;
arms to embrace the oppressed of all lands who&#xD;
sought its protection, would crumble into atoms.&#xD;
The slave, what was he? Only a wedge to make&#xD;
it still firmer, the fruit of whose toil would 1ie1p to&#xD;
swell the streams of benevolence so profusely applied&#xD;
to the evangelization of heathen lands. Did he suf-&#xD;

stronger.&#xD;
Before order was fully rc~tored a young man was&#xD;

son they did not themselves know. It was Waltei~&#xD;

youthful appearance of one who had the boldness to&#xD;
come forward after so much distinguished talent,&#xD;
and his winning appearance prepossessed all in his&#xD;
&#xD;
::~ favor. He stood, surveying the audience until sb&#xD;
lence reigned throughout the crowded hall.&#xD;
"Law is divine," said he. "Prom the starry&#xD;
worlds overhead to the minutest insect at our fe&amp;amp;t,&#xD;
law is the one great fact which binds every object&#xD;
and every being to an immutable fiat that is coeval&#xD;
with creation, and which our puny efforts may strive&#xD;
in vain to oppose. The same is true of the moral&#xD;
world. God has written his law in every human&#xD;
soul, with the penalties annexed *for its violation ;&#xD;
and as xvell might you attempt tc~ blot Areturus from&#xD;
the skies as to evade its retribution on the evil doer.&#xD;
What is government? The reverend gentleman who,&#xD;
occupied this platform asserts that governments are&#xD;

*    TI~e proper function of law as applied to society, is&#xD;

it fails in this it is no longer binding on the con-&#xD;

brightest lights in~ jurisprudence, whence this nation&#xD;
borrowed its common law. In other words all human&#xD;
enactments must conform to the natural or revealed&#xD;
law before they can impose obligations to obey them,&#xD;
since that is coev~il with mankind and dictated by&#xD;
God himself; of binding force over all the globe in&#xD;
all countries, and at all times. The reverend geii-&#xD;

bringing scarcely less of joy and gladness, beauty&#xD;

a few weeks of the hottest season, which prom~scd&#xD;
quite a change for them, as they rarely felt any in-&#xD;

ed "vegables" as well as flowers. Finally every&#xD;
thing was settled to her satisfaction.. Kate prom-&#xD;
~    ised to feed the kittens and take care of the garden,&#xD;
~nd she looked forward td the anticipated journey&#xD;
with as much joy as any of them, provided they did&#xD;
not go before her peas were large enough to eat, as&#xD;
she was to have a little dinner party then, to be serv-&#xD;
ed from her own garden. There was no end to her&#xD;
questions about the probable growth of everything&#xD;
during their abseiice, asking her father to drive in a&#xD;
stake before they left, about as high as he thought&#xD;
her corn would roach when they returned, to see&#xD;
how good he was for guessing. The oats she thought&#xD;
might be quite ripe so she could teed them to the&#xD;
horse. "Oh father, what if they should all dry up&#xD;
and wither before I get back ; then I should wish I&#xD;
had took a little ~ketch of my garden," said she laugh~&#xD;

But one bright summer morning, when the air&#xD;
resounded with the song of birds, and the hum of&#xD;
bright winged insects testified to the gladness of&#xD;
their short life; when the sun's penetrating rays&#xD;
quickened the earth's vegetation with the promise&#xD;
of golden harvests, the heavenly Reaper came to&#xD;
gather in his more thaii golden treasure which need-&#xD;
ed neither summer rain nor autumn sun to perfect&#xD;
it for his hands. Lilly, the May-flower, sickened&#xD;
and died. No skill could save her, no rending cry&#xD;

lovingly, she took her flight. Towards noon she&#xD;
came to her mother and laid her head in her lap,&#xD;
saying "Mother, will you please take me up, i'm so&#xD;
tired !"&#xD;
A high fever already coursed through her veins,&#xD;
and she fell a victim to a mortal disease very preva-&#xD;
lent among children that summer; but she had&#xD;
always been so healthy not one of the family had&#xD;
thought of feeling any anxiety for her. Little, were&#xD;
they aware hoxV firmly their affections were centered&#xD;
in her, or how important a part she lornj.cd of every&#xD;
plan for the future. If the thought ever suggested&#xD;
itself that she might not live, it was banished with a&#xD;
feeling akin to that a child feels for a mother, who,&#xD;
associated with every moment of life, and sharing&#xD;
every joy and sorrow as no other person can, forms&#xD;
such ai~ essential part of existence, that the thought&#xD;
of parting with her is as unwelcome as a nightmare&#xD;
d ream.&#xD;
Lilly did not suffer as much as seine. During&#xD;
most of the time she lay in a languid state, smiling&#xD;
faintly when spoken to, and seldom making an effort&#xD;
to speak. She died in her father's arms, and the&#xD;
last words she said were, "Father, I cannot see you&#xD;
now; but you can see my picture."&#xD;
That picture! The death Angel touched it and&#xD;
straightway it was transfigured into a celestial beauty&#xD;
earthly I)ands could not impart, nor earthly passions&#xD;
take away. But who shall describe that father's&#xD;
anguish! During her sickness he had scarcely eaten&#xD;
or sleptand his nervous system was now prostrated.&#xD;
As long as there was life he felt there was hope, and&#xD;
&#xD;
even after the vital spark had fled he reluctantly&#xD;
gave her up, not until Rosalind whispered, "Shall&#xD;
we not restore unto God his own?"&#xD;
Tier fortitude through it all ws~s remarkable. She&#xD;
was redeeming the pledge made unto God at the&#xD;
time of her marriage. If her experience had taught&#xD;
her anything it was that she had no right to assume&#xD;
any voluntary relation that should subject her to the&#xD;
vicissitudes of life and death, unless willing to meet&#xD;
them more submissively than she had done the loss&#xD;
of her father. Often had she renewed this pledge, as&#xD;
day 1)y day she watched the unfolding of this fair&#xD;
flower, and asked herself :l~e question, "if this treas-&#xD;
ure should be called for at my hands, could I give&#xD;
her up?"&#xD;
Then leaving a kiss on that innocent brow she&#xD;
strove within herself to feel that ~hc was only lent,&#xD;
not given. She marvelled at her own strength in&#xD;
this hour of trial, but, was anything ever asked of God&#xD;
in prayer that ~as not granted? All the exquisite&#xD;
tenderness of her nature burst forth, and she turned&#xD;
from' the dead now at rest to the living who needed&#xD;
her consolati9 n and support, banishing her own grief&#xD;
in ministerin unto others. In her self-forgetfulness&#xD;
lay her stren th, and the sight of her husband's s~r-&#xD;
row made hmem~ rise above her own.&#xD;
Mrs. Claremont was the animating spirit of the&#xD;
house. So cheerfully she set about the performance&#xD;
of every duty, and attended to all that had been&#xD;
Lilly's special care, those parents felt that it would&#xD;
have been an act of ingratitude to have appeared&#xD;
otherwise than cheerful in her presence. From the&#xD;

little garden she gathered flowers to make a wreath&#xD;
to encircle her head, and an opening white rosebud&#xD;
to place in her hand, while at the head sl~e placed&#xD;
the little vase that had~ been supplied with a boquet&#xD;
throughout the season, arranged by Lilly's own hands,&#xD;
and which was still preserved in its old place on her&#xD;
mother's work-table, and as tenderly cared for by&#xD;
Mrs. Claremont.&#xD;
What sight is more touchingly beautiful than that&#xD;
of an infant shrouded for the tomb? How innocent&#xD;
'is the expression of every feature! How symbolic the&#xD;
little hands, of a pwfeet trust in the great Father's&#xD;
watchful care over all, as they repose so naturally on&#xD;
the little bosom that will never again heave in an-&#xD;
guish or shake with laughter.&#xD;
The family circle seems scarcely complete without&#xD;
the presence of an angel child. While others bring&#xD;
care and anxiety, if not sorrow to their parents, one&#xD;
they may always point to as pure and undefiled,&#xD;
ministering in the Father's kingdom, to win them&#xD;
from the attractions of this world through this nearer&#xD;
glimpse of heaven, sometimes coming in the silent&#xD;
watches of the night, or sanctifying daily toil with&#xD;
the hallowed breath of inspiration. Not alone through&#xD;
joy and sunshine, but through pain and tears, love&#xD;
is strengthened; and we are false to the highest teach-&#xD;
ings of revelation, if for every tie that is severed, we&#xD;
do not make propitiation to the living by fresh efforts&#xD;
to raise the standard of family devotion above the&#xD;
petty bickering and jealousies which are born of&#xD;
the passions, and can have no aflinity with the higher&#xD;

Though Mr. Livingston tried hard to appear recon-&#xD;
ciled he could not conceal the heavy grief that settled&#xD;
It'&#xD;
upon his spirits. He sought to banish it by close&#xD;
{ application to his pencil, but the little silky brown&#xD;
'~i~ head claimed admission there, and drove all other&#xD;
subjects from his mind. Ho journeyed, but the in-&#xD;
finite charm that had been wont to steal over his&#xD;
senses when he gave himself up to revelry among the&#xD;
scenes of nature, had suddenly departed, and in its&#xD;
stead came another charm, one of peculiar sacred-&#xD;
II&#xD;
ness, revealing an angel presence ever flitting before&#xD;
him and dulling his senses to the perception of other&#xD;
objects. Accompanied by Rosalind, it was only in&#xD;
her society that he found any consolation, either at&#xD;
home or abroad. She always met him with a cheer-&#xD;
4    ful smile which elicited' one in return, and that grief&#xD;
must be very obdurate which will not give way in the&#xD;
presence of two smiling faces.&#xD;
It was a hallowed hour in that lonely home, one&#xD;
of tender and sacred memory; when another form&#xD;
constantly glided before and whispered to them&#xD;
words of the most endearing love. Whether at home&#xD;
or abroad, on the velvet turf or in the dusty street,&#xD;
wherever the foot pressed or the eye rested, the&#xD;
little silky brown head came to remind them of&#xD;

There was another upon whom Lilly's death fell as&#xD;
a heavy stroke of affliction, to whom Mrs. Claremont&#xD;
sought to administer all the consolation feeble words&#xD;
could convey; feeble indeed, for they fall so far short&#xD;
of what the soul craves at such times, that it is&#xD;
almost a mockery to utter them. And yet will all&#xD;
these little kind offlc&amp;amp;s be treasured up in the store-&#xD;

not fail to be appreciated in the maturer wisdom of&#xD;
future years.&#xD;
There are as many different kinds of affection in&#xD;
the world as there are different mental organizations.&#xD;
One kind is strong, ardent, full of enthusiasm and&#xD;
demonstration, like Rosalind. Another kind, just as&#xD;
strong, just as ardent, but so quiet and undemon-&#xD;
strative, as scarcely to reveal its existence until some&#xD;
shock threatens to rend asunder the very heartstrings&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
of life, was illustrated in Milly. Isolated as she was&#xD;
in every human tie, her affection for Lilly had stirred&#xD;
her soul's depths as they were never stirred before.&#xD;

one more gentle pressure of that soft cheek against&#xD;
hei own, o~n~ more merry twinkle of those eyes be-&#xD;

j   life?  Why not permit it to exhale its fragrance&#xD;

ry different from those labored effusions which&#xD;
excited Kate's facetious criticisms-the passages&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
~ Those laughing orbs, that borrow&#xD;
From azure skies the light they wear,&#xD;
Are like heaven-no sorrow&#xD;
Can float o'er hues so fair."&#xD;
The merry month of May again came round, bear-&#xD;
ing in its bosom a merry gift for those stricken&#xD;
parents. Another daughter was born, not the coun-&#xD;
terpart of Lilly, but that was no matter. A baby&#xD;
had come to enliven the oppressive stillness of the&#xD;
house, which was never still afterWards, and there-&#xD;
fore was thrice welcome. Full of life and motion&#xD;
she demanded as much attention as one little body&#xD;
could well lay claim to. She never folded her hands&#xD;
so meekly, you could almost fancy the bliss of heaven&#xD;
clasped there, as Lilly had been wont to do. From&#xD;
the time her eyes were open in the morning uixtil&#xD;
they closed at night, was one gala-day of fun and&#xD;
frolic. her merry laugh apprised every one of her&#xD;
approach, and her tireless activity and thoughtless&#xD;
hove of mischief required constant amusement and&#xD;
wat&amp;amp;hfiilness. At nine months of age she walked,&#xD;
and then not a work-basket, trinket or anything else&#xD;
could be left within reach that did not suffer from&#xD;
her roguish fingers. When there is such a dominant&#xD;
love of fun it is almost impossible to keep a child out&#xD;
~f mischief, not from a wanton love of it, but from&#xD;

an unconquerable desire to laugh at the effects of it.&#xD;
Her sunny temper was never ruffled by the vexatious&#xD;
queries so annoying to her mother's childhood.&#xD;
Having blue eyes and curly hair, she resembled her&#xD;
somewhat, yet not so much a~ that picture of her&#xD;
father's which first arrested Walter's attention and&#xD;
opened the way for their acquaintance. She some-&#xD;
times visited her father's studio, but only to misplace&#xD;
every thing she could lay her hands upon and add&#xD;
variety to his sketches after her QWII plan. The&#xD;
whole house was at her command and she reigned&#xD;
queen over them all, for no oiie could think of being&#xD;
impatient with the source of so much happiness.&#xD;
Mr. Livingston seemed quite like himself again, ant&#xD;
Kate, who had been the impersonation of gravity&#xD;
since tho death of Lilly, finding no words to express&#xD;
her gri6f, made the house ring with music as she&#xD;
kept time to the patter of childish glee. This was&#xD;
bettor fun than criticizing Milly's novel, a theme&#xD;
already exhausted for her, and she seldom intruded&#xD;
into that sanctum now. Better also than settling&#xD;
the troubles of young house-keepers, or ellumeratiug&#xD;
"Sykes" adventures. Such is the unconscious power&#xD;
of childhood.&#xD;
" Will mother have a full blown rose this morn~&#xD;
ing? " said Mr. Livingston as he brought her in&#xD;
crowned for the first time with a wreath of flowers&#xD;
as he had often crowned Lilly ii~ her babyhood. Her&#xD;
rosy, dimpled cheeks and joyous laugh showed how&#xD;
fully and keenly she entered into the lively appre-&#xD;
ciation. of every pleasure the physical world affords.&#xD;

it falls crushed and mutilated at his feet; and then&#xD;
hear the ringing laugh! And the next moment she&#xD;
is out of his arms and out of sight, playing, ." bo~&#xD;
peep!" and ore he can catch her, away again.&#xD;
Once while Kate had her in charge in the vicinity&#xD;
of Milly's room, the latter left the door ajar for a&#xD;
second as she stepped into the hall, which the little&#xD;
Rosie quickly perceived and bent thitherward her&#xD;
nimble feet. The next instant the inkstand was up-&#xD;
set over a pile of manuscript. "Why Rosie, what&#xD;
woift you do next?" exclaimed Milly~ as the devas-&#xD;
tating sight met her eyes. Kate ran in to see what&#xD;
had happened and laughed as sh~ remarked,&#xD;
"A rather melancholy end fbr your novel to comC&#xD;
to isn't it?"&#xD;
On looking for the child she was not to be found&#xD;
up stairs or down. Kate at last espied her behind a&#xD;
large rocker in her grand-mother's chamber in a&#xD;
little niche that would just admjt her, With eyes so&#xD;
wild and big as to be scarcely recognized, and curled&#xD;
up in the smallest possible space. She looked so&#xD;
comical that she ran to call Mr. Livingston, who had&#xD;
just entered. . lIe could scarcely suppress a smile at&#xD;
the unwanted seriousness of that roguish little head&#xD;
which sought to retreat farther back, showing how&#xD;
keen a child's instinct, is to comprehend that it has&#xD;
done something wrong, deserving of reproof, being&#xD;
then only a year and a half old. Reluctantly she&#xD;

too much for that little bosom to contain, and lie&#xD;

she quickly did by proposing a game at "hide-and.&#xD;

The little golden haired girl who made her first&#xD;

visited her mother in her distress, had been adopted&#xD;
into the family at hei~ mother's death which occurred&#xD;

"There I maddened. Life swept through me into fever,&#xD;
And my soul sprang up astonished-sprang full stature in an&#xD;
hour;&#xD;
Know you what it is when anguish with apocalyptic Never&#xD;
To a Pytl~iafl height dilates you, and despair sublimes to power?"&#xD;
It is well human nature is so constituted that one's&#xD;
joy is not banished by another's sorrow, otherwise&#xD;
there would be no enjoyment in this life. To every&#xD;
individual, sooner or later, comes his own trial-hour,&#xD;
and that is sufficient for himself. The world may&#xD;
not know of it, but no matter, the purification goes&#xD;
on, and the inaudible sigh is nct unheard in heaven's&#xD;
chancery, whether surrounded by the music and&#xD;
mirth of loving friends, or the thoughtless indiffer~&#xD;

cordial grasp of sympathy.&#xD;

ladies, she yielded to their customs, and even the&#xD;
repugnance at being waited on by slaves was soon&#xD;
overcome, the more rer~dily as the change of climate&#xD;
at that season of the year enervated her physical&#xD;
energies.&#xD;
As Mr. Carleton was s~4dom cruel unless rouse dby&#xD;
L&#xD;
some strong passion, an 41 his plantation not an exten~&#xD;
sivo one, his wife was never w~itness of the worst&#xD;
features of slavery, if by this term we mean the great~&#xD;
est physical suffering. Deeming kindness the most&#xD;
effectual barrier against the crime of running a way,&#xD;
when they showed their ingiatitude by doing so, he&#xD;
was as merciless as any other. During his residence&#xD;
in the north lie had been led to doubt considerably&#xD;
the expediency. of slave labor, from the contrast&#xD;
continually presented between northern thrift and&#xD;
southern indolence, but his convictions on this point&#xD;
never touched upon the first grain of principle and&#xD;
were soon forgQtten on his return to its borders.&#xD;
Tue most of his slaves were inherited from his&#xD;
father, whose death occurred a short time previous to&#xD;
his acquaintance with Miss Blanche. One beautjfuh&#xD;
bx~unette he. bought soon after his marriage for a&#xD;
waiting maid for his wife, who seemed well enough&#xD;
pleased with the selection, inasmuch as she shared the&#xD;
northern prejudice against color, and such familiar&#xD;
contact with the Africah race as the Southern mode&#xD;
of life produced, was ex ~rernoly repulsive to the staid&#xD;
influences of her northern education.&#xD;
This slave had just enough of the negro blood in&#xD;
her veins to ripple her hair slightly, which was of the&#xD;
glossiest black, and impart to her countenance that&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
CONNECTICUT.&#xD;
&#xD;
doubtful hue, which puzzles the beholder to -know&#xD;
whether the flesh and blood he sees before hii~-is an&#xD;
unmixed specimen of the superior race, and thus&#xD;
entitled to the rank and privileges of a human being,&#xD;
or whether, owing to the vices of that superior race,&#xD;
sanctioned by the existing laws of the land, a chattel&#xD;
slave is the highest rank to which this immortal soul&#xD;
can ever aspire. She bore none of the badges of&#xD;
servitude, her carriage and mien resembling more the&#xD;
northern prostWute, than the subj~iissive victim of&#xD;
southern institutions. Lost to all sense of degrada-&#xD;
tion she glories in her fascinating power over others,&#xD;
for at the same time she held her master in thrall,&#xD;
her mistress was so won over by her proffered kind~&#xD;
ness and thousand little acts of dissimulation, that&#xD;
the slightest breath of reproach from any of the feb&#xD;
low slaves would not have been tolerated by her, but&#xD;
this confidence was of short duration.&#xD;
Mrs. Carleton was not a woman of an investigating&#xD;
mind. Of benevolent impulses, she delighted in&#xD;
relieving cases of suffering that came immediately&#xD;
under her observation, but of their causes and char-&#xD;
acter she knew far less thap. Rosalind, or even Milly.&#xD;
She was none of the world's deep thinkers.. Gaining&#xD;
the affections of all who saw her by her rare charms&#xD;
of manner and conversation, and possessing also a&#xD;
dignity that forbade any unbecoming familiarity with&#xD;
inferiors, at the same time that she mingled respect&#xD;
with condescension, the spirit of caste was not&#xD;
offended, and* she was no less a favorite in her new&#xD;
home among all classes than she had been at the&#xD;
north. No one who saw her in the opening bloom of&#xD;

could have imagined that the futur~ had in store for&#xD;
her such a mingled cup of bitterness and strife.&#xD;
None probably had met with less ~to discipline the&#xD;
character up to the time of her marriage.&#xD;
Another slave, about the age of Mr. Carleton, and&#xD;
once a particular favorite of the flimiiy, though by no&#xD;
means the counterpart of the brunette, either in perh&#xD;
sonal attractions or profligacy of character, deeply&#xD;
aggravated by a sense of the wi'ongs she had suffered,&#xD;
could not brook with indifference this new invasion&#xD;
of her own domain, nor the duplicity thus carried on&#xD;
before the eyes of the unsuspecting wife. By nature&#xD;
of ~ meek, inoffensive disposition, the degradation to&#xD;
which she had been forced roused all the spirit within&#xD;
her, and she assumed a tone of defiance toward all but&#xD;
Mrs. Carleton, in whose presence a habitual melan~&#xD;
choly had always pervaded her features, exciting her&#xD;
curiosity to know something of her previous history,&#xD;
which, failing to learn from her husband, she resolved&#xD;
to gain from the slave herself. He divined this, either&#xD;
from his adroitness in reading the expression of the&#xD;
human countenance, or from inere conjecture, and~&#xD;
forthwith established a system of surveillance which&#xD;
was rendered complete by introducing this young&#xD;
slave to be the constant companion of her mistress,&#xD;
thus rendering all interviews b~txveen her and the&#xD;
elder sl~ve impossible. It was a source of no little&#xD;
discomfiture to the latter to be thus supplanted by&#xD;
the young brunette, not only for the loss of station&#xD;

Mr. Carleton soon found himself between two fires.&#xD;
He was obliged to conciliate the one and studiously&#xD;
avoid giving offence to the other, since only in main-&#xD;
tailiing his swat over their feelings and fears, could&#xD;
he hope to preserve, undisturbed by jealousy, the&#xD;
reverefleC and affections of his wife. His attentions&#xD;

by the gross violation of all the sanctities of humanity&#xD;
in the midst of which she lived, because sanctioned&#xD;
by existing laws and therefore must be endured, was&#xD;
then called 'to face the fearful chasm into which all&#xD;

time his manne' changed, and before she recovered&#xD;
his neglect bec me so marked that a return of the&#xD;
fever was feare in consequence of the effect on her&#xD;
nerves.&#xD;
The elder ~lavo woman, who had been so aggrieved&#xD;
at being separated from her mistress, was now per~&#xD;
mitted to attend her, and nursed her as tenderly as&#xD;
a mother. When the patient was so far convalescent&#xD;
as to talk without injury, she besought Chrissy, her&#xD;
nurse, to relate her history.&#xD;
"Not now, honey," she replied, "for it is a long,&#xD;
sad story, and 'pears like it might give you a misery&#xD;
somewhere. There now honey, lie down and rest&#xD;
you and P11 sing the New Jerusalem."&#xD;
As the shrill notes of her sonorous voice rung out&#xD;
clear and loud upon the evening air, accompanied&#xD;
by that swaying motion of the body which aLtends&#xD;
their highest state of exaltation, Mrs. Carleton was&#xD;
reminded of an old legend familiar to the days&#xD;
of her childhood, of an elfish looking woman who&#xD;
was said to inhakit a certain retired locality in her&#xD;
native city, where her wild song often resounded&#xD;
through the midnight air, though no one was ever&#xD;
able to trace her home, where she caine from or&#xD;
what became of her. Her sleep that night was dis.&#xD;
turned by fearful forebodings of the future, until&#xD;
towards morning when a quiet shimber was varied&#xD;
with pleasant dreams of home, a home ~ucIi as it&#xD;
should be, where in the society of her two children,&#xD;
her tim6 was divided between her attentions to them&#xD;
&#xD;
and some benevolent mission, such as she had once&#xD;
engaged in at the north, bringing the most pleasure~&#xD;
able reminiscences of old friends and scenes long&#xD;
since forgotten.&#xD;
Being in too weak a state for the mind to throw&#xD;
off these unfavorable reactions, it was many days&#xD;
before any iinprovem~flt was discernible, and Chrissy,&#xD;
whose quick perceptions readily divined the cause of&#xD;
her protracted recovery, was so guarded in all her&#xD;
inquiries concernillt the state of her 'health and&#xD;
topics of conversation generally, always omitting any&#xD;
reference to Mr. Carleton, that her patient was well&#xD;
aware of her comprehension. of the true nature of&#xD;
the case. As she ki~y one day absorbed in reflection&#xD;
the sight of the swarthy face so pitifully fixed upon&#xD;
h~r filled her with a most painful apprehension, and&#xD;
she again entreated her for a sketch of her history.&#xD;
This time she refused, shaking her head ominously,&#xD;
and heaved a deep sigh as her eyes vacantly rested&#xD;
on a large magnolia tree that stood sentinel at the&#xD;
corner of the lawn. Chrissy was ~what is denominated&#xD;
among the blacks a "yallev woman," a t6rrn, some~&#xD;
times significant of a doubtful kind of esteem, either&#xD;
from a dim sense of its immorality, or an inherent&#xD;
feeling of contempt for these mongrel specimens of&#xD;
races, representing neither one nor the other, and&#xD;
which do often excite a painful sensation as if nature&#xD;
had stepped out of her course, when the yell6wish&#xD;
skin is accompanied with eyes and hair of the same&#xD;
hue. She was rather dark, and her eyes were more&#xD;
of a gray, her hair straight and black, so that she&#xD;
would about as readily pass for a dark skinned white&#xD;

&#xD;
woman, as a representative of the African race.&#xD;
Standing on the average level of moral perceptions&#xD;
she would have maintained a virtuous character in&#xD;
an ordinary community, and that she could not do&#xD;
so here, added to her sense of degradation and ren-&#xD;
dered her indifferent to anything higher.&#xD;
The brunette was still there, now the presidiiig&#xD;
mistress of the house, exciting both the hatred and&#xD;
contempt of the other sla;-es, by her assumed supe-&#xD;
riority over them, as if a free white woman. Mrs.&#xD;
Carleton had long since dispensed with her attend-&#xD;
ance, since which time she had maintained a more&#xD;
independent position than before. She followed her&#xD;
business as seamstress, subject to the control of no&#xD;
one, not even of her master, over whom she had&#xD;
obtained such unlimited sway that every desire was&#xD;
granted, and her wardrobe equalled that of her mis-&#xD;
tress in beauty and richness.&#xD;
The time came at length when Chrissy volunteered&#xD;
an account ~f herself. Mrs. Carleton had gained&#xD;
strength rapidly for a few days, having nerved her-&#xD;
self tq bear her fate with becoming resignation, and&#xD;
resolved that her happiness for the future ~Iioul.l be&#xD;
centered in her two children, a son and daughter,&#xD;
both of whom closely resembled their mother. She&#xD;
intended to preserve them as much as possible from&#xD;
the demoralizing influences by which they were sur-&#xD;
rounded, and instil into their minds northern ideas&#xD;
and the precepts that had formed the basis of her&#xD;
Own dedication. Not yet fully awake to the crippling&#xD;
nature of slave institutions, it had not occurred to&#xD;
her that they could interpose a barrier between the&#xD;
&#xD;
white mother and her child, by laying any restriction&#xD;
upon the widest range of development the highest&#xD;
moral training could promote.&#xD;
The children were soon removed from her control&#xD;
by the introduction of a governess to whom was as-&#xD;
- signed the entire supervision of their education.&#xD;
This was done without consulting her at all, and but&#xD;
for the strongest effort of self-control, her nerves&#xD;
4&#xD;
K     would have again been shattered by this insult to her&#xD;
sacred relation of wife and mother. Realizing her&#xD;
helplessness to diango the ciirrent domestic affairs&#xD;
were taking, she considered it the wisest course to&#xD;
get along with as few words as possible, always having&#xD;
regarded a family outbreak as one of the most pain-&#xD;
ful things to be dreaded.&#xD;
Soon after this Mr. Carleton started on a business&#xD;
tour which was to take him to New Orleans, and no&#xD;
little surprise was excited when it was discovered&#xD;
that the brunette was also missing; but whether they&#xD;
had left together, or she had taken advantage of the&#xD;
opportunity to secure her ox~rii freedom, all of them&#xD;
were equally at a loss to conjecture. One thing. was&#xD;
ascertained that she did not leave the city with him,&#xD;
which was hardly to be expected. under any supposi-&#xD;

articles of her ward-robe were gone, and what were&#xD;
Chrissy's amazement and dismay, when by some uner.&#xD;
ring instinct she was 'led to her only secret drawer&#xD;
containing the only treasure now remaining of her&#xD;
master's former regard, a gold ring, and found it was&#xD;
no longer there! Her rage knew no bounds. She&#xD;

could in any way deface. It was the more aggravating&#xD;
that she had often this ring in scorn at her rival&#xD;
i~or presuming to tell her that he never cared for her,&#xD;
which was also resOntQd by warning her that such&#xD;
would be 1her fate, 'when age should in the least rob&#xD;

Then rushing into Mrs. Carleton's roqm, who&#xD;
turned deadly pale at this sudden outbreak of pas~&#xD;

every thing, and then brought this vile wench here&#xD;
to insult and plunder me, but bless me honey~ what&#xD;

Here she stopped abruptly, wringing her bands&#xD;
desperately, and struck with terror at ~the thought&#xD;
of her boldness and its consequences, when she saw&#xD;
her mistress sink down in a chair as if ready to&#xD;
swoon. By a strong effort Mrs. Carleton ~oon rallied,&#xD;
and, anxious to hear what this strange \wornan had&#xD;
to say, urged her to go on as calmly as\ she could.&#xD;
Clirissy softened down considerably at the sight of&#xD;

to their own confbssion; an.d after smoking for a few&#xD;
momentss, gave her brief narrative, only relating its&#xD;
most staking points.&#xD;
"I was raised in old V'irginuiy, but I won't give&#xD;
the first particulars of my life, which you xvill be&#xD;
soon enough to find out, but honey, I wish'. you'd&#xD;
smoke a pipe, it would-make you feel so much better,&#xD;
it does me so much good when I have a trouble. I&#xD;
was about sixteen when my old ixiaster brought us&#xD;
here with the rest of his things, about sixty head of&#xD;
us in all, mostly field-.hands, but I had a sister a Little&#xD;
older, a house servant, who was married to my mas~&#xD;
ter's coachman, and they had one child. A slave&#xD;
* trader came one day and ~auted to buy her, offering'&#xD;
a right smart price, but he didn't want the child.&#xD;
My master would not consent to separate 'em at first&#xD;
for 'she was a pretty creetur and so was the child, but&#xD;
he wanted the money, and the bargain was made.&#xD;
To do the thing up as quiet as possible, the child was&#xD;
sent off to a nelghl)oring plantation on ~oxne pre-&#xD;
tence, when sh~ was told to g~t ready as quick as&#xD;
she could.. Such screeches as she made frightened&#xD;
me 'and I tried to beg her off. We had both been&#xD;
treated well, and as I was very near of kin I felt sure&#xD;
he would listen to me. All the answer I got was&#xD;
that he W~uld sell me too if I didn't shut up. So&#xD;
with a crack of the driver's whip she was hurried&#xD;
into the cart and I never see her again. 11ev' hus-&#xD;
band took on mighty bad that night when he come&#xD;
to be alone, and when the child came home, and&#xD;
asked so mournfully for his mother every few miii-&#xD;

utos, I tell you missus, I felt mighty bad too. I tried&#xD;
to comfort 'em, and told 'em how the Lord Jesus&#xD;
knew it all and how we must go to him with all our&#xD;
troubles, and how he liked little children and took&#xD;
'em in his arms, and they seemed to feel a heap bet~&#xD;
ter. My young master was always very kind to me,&#xD;
and when David got over it a little bit ,and Wanted&#xD;
to marry me, he let us have a little cottage close by&#xD;
where he used to come very often, and that was the&#xD;
trouble, missus, he come too often. He made me&#xD;
presents, that ring she carried off, (throwing down&#xD;
h~r pipe and stamping her foot with great vehemence&#xD;
on the floor) ha, ha,. I hope she's run off. He never&#xD;
thought of my runniix' off, but freedom's sweeter 'n&#xD;
any thing else. My husband was sold before one&#xD;
year was out, toni away from his two children, &amp;amp;r II&#xD;
had a little baby then, and 1 never shall forget how&#xD;
he watched it up and kissed it that morning' 'afore I&#xD;
was up, and said 'good bye Chrissy, I've got to&#xD;
leave you,' and was hurried off without giving me a&#xD;
chance to say a word. Then I took to his oldest&#xD;
child more'xi evcrb He looked just like his father,&#xD;
and peeredd as if he was almost speaking' to me when&#xD;
I heard him talk, but before I had time to get over&#xD;
it he was sold too. My young master was still good&#xD;
to me and tried to comfort me, saying, my baby&#xD;
:xever should be sold, for lie wouldn't permit it and&#xD;
tEe blessed Jesus took it to himself soon after.&#xD;
Though I was all alone then, it was nothing' like its&#xD;
bein' sold, for I knew where it was and it wouldn't&#xD;
suffer no more. Well, one night after my young&#xD;

myself, where shall I run to? and it' kept sayin',&#xD;
run. Then I got to thinki' about my child, how&#xD;
it wotild be born a slave and might be sold, and I&#xD;
did run that very night. and got away 'without hem'&#xD;
overtaken. I had money that my master gave inc&#xD;

brought in an old black nigger, that was the ugliest&#xD;
one then on the plantation, and always the one that&#xD;
done the whippin's, and told me I'd got to marry&#xD;
him. If 't had beeii my old master, nothing' would&#xD;
'a been too bad for him to do, but that it should 'ave&#xD;
beei him, and all because I wanted. to have his child&#xD;
free, and he knew how I felt about it. Well, that&#xD;

the way lie got track of me. He didn't come back&#xD;
again to sl~ay till the winter before he brought you&#xD;
here, and his father was dead then. He nevei' took&#xD;
much notice of me, but I follereci him like a ghost.&#xD;
[hadn't any fear of him then, and was so afraid he'd&#xD;
sell my children that every time a stranger was&#xD;
round I listened. Well, one night I listened," then&#xD;
turning to Mrs. Carleton, "be strong honey, and cast&#xD;
all your trouble on the Lord Jesus, that's the way I&#xD;
do, and when I feels very wicked he comes and quiets&#xD;
me and tells me about his crowii of thorns, and how&#xD;
he suffered that I might be good, and then I feel's&#xD;

Chrissy here related the substance of the cover~&#xD;
station narrated 'in a previous chapter, and then&#xD;
sti~aighteniug herself up with an air of triumph,&#xD;
continued, "I kept it all to myself and didn't even&#xD;
let the birds know what I'd heerd, 'cause you know&#xD;
They'll carry things strangely sometimes. When you&#xD;
first came he treated me with his old kindness, and&#xD;
I felt as if I was Willin'. to forgive him for all he'd&#xD;
done to me;, then he brought that young thing here&#xD;
and told me I wan't needed any more and he was&#xD;
goin' to hire me out. All my blood was in a boil&#xD;
then, and I spoke right out and told him what I'd&#xD;
overheard, but didn't let him know I'd overheard it.&#xD;
Says I 'Massa~ you know we was children together,&#xD;

brute to raise you slaves for the market, and just&#xD;
a~ sure as you take m~ out of this house .111 tell he,',&#xD;
or somebody that it will ~et to her, or if you, sell&#xD;
~rther of my cirihiren.' The oldest one was sold to&#xD;
help pay the debts after his father died, and I hadn't&#xD;
forgot it. He turned as white as a sheet and I&#xD;
thought he almost trembled, but whether with anger&#xD;
or fear I could riot tell. I knew I was havin' my&#xD;
revenge, and I was as firm a~ a stone. I had no&#xD;
more fear of him than as if lie had been my slave,&#xD;
and he knew I had him in my power, unless he took&#xD;
my life. I always knew lie was afraid I should tell&#xD;
you about his child, but if he'd treated me well I&#xD;
shouldn't, for I loved him enough never to lia~ve run&#xD;
away if it hadn't been for fear of the' child hem'&#xD;
sold, and I khew there was no confidence to be put&#xD;
in his word more than any body else, arid that it&#xD;
wouldn't be any safer than if it had been Davi&amp;amp;s."&#xD;
Mrs. Carleton listened to this recital apparently&#xD;
unmoved, but a storm ~f agitation was ragiirg in her&#xD;
bosom, arid before it was finished her resolution was&#xD;
formed which, ore two days passed away, resulted i~r&#xD;
another exit from the house of Mr. Carleton. A&#xD;
fugitive wife and her two children took a train of&#xD;
cars for the north, and when her husband returned&#xD;
at the end of a week, he found himself minus the&#xD;
brunette, the wife and children, for whom he really&#xD;
had a very strong aWection. Chrissy met him in her&#xD;
Lisual fearless manner secretly exulting. in his mor-&#xD;
tifying predicament, a~nd nothing daunted. The&#xD;
brunette he was obliged to give up as lqst property.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nothing would subject him to the humiliation of&#xD;
raising onnO inquiry respecting her, and he could&#xD;
easily perceive in the forced gravity of his slaves&#xD;
that they h~d a ludicrous perception o~f matters and&#xD;
things as they then stood. Unusually obsequious in&#xD;
all their endeavors to please, many a smile he could&#xD;
detect suddenly vanishing into a most comic, serious&#xD;
expression when lie turned quickly towards them.&#xD;
"TIalloa Sambo, how are you?" said he to the&#xD;
coachman, who was shaking his sides as a bi'oad grin&#xD;
displayed his shining ivory to the best advantage,&#xD;
unmindful of his master's presence. " Tol' able&#xD;
thank 'cc sir, tol' able, and hopes massa' s right well&#xD;
too," replied he, stepping, significantly on th~ toe of&#xD;
the ostler which was suffering from a corn, causing&#xD;
him to scream, which gave rise to a roar of laughter&#xD;
ai~ong the whole gang who had gathered around to&#xD;
welcome their master.&#xD;
Thero was a general tumbling and rolling on the&#xD;
grass by the younger members of the group when&#xD;
Mr. Carleton returned to the house.&#xD;
"Wonder of massa '11 put de bloodhounds on do&#xD;
trail to-night" said one.&#xD;
"Wonder heder he'll try to c~tch missus or do&#xD;

burst of laughter, a.cco~npanked with the remark,&#xD;
"Guess if she knew you called he~ a nigger, she'd&#xD;
be arter ye wid a pitchfork."&#xD;
" Uon't tink massa feel like *jumpin' Jim Crow&#xD;

Ethiop, as he turned somerset and landed on his feet&#xD;
before the words had fairly escaped his lips. Little&#xD;

as her future home, wisely resolving to make the&#xD;
utmost endeavors, to leave the past behind her, and,&#xD;
once more surrounded by the friends of her young&#xD;
days, seek to retrieve this fatal step by devoting her&#xD;
life to the relief of the misery existing around her.&#xD;
Little did she know the secret inroads her trials and&#xD;
sufferings had produced upon her physical constita-&#xD;
tion, or the mental exhaustion which was fast Pros-&#xD;
trating her whole system. These causes alone were&#xD;
sufficient to ch ange the whole atmosphere of her&#xD;
northern home, and when in addition came the&#xD;
consciousness of the. waning affections of those who&#xD;
had gathered around her so adoringly in the happy&#xD;
days of her youth, which even ten years of separa-&#xD;
tion may produce, that frail bark stranded, and she&#xD;
sunk down on her couch never ~expecting to rise&#xD;
again.&#xD;
Heroically she struggled with the painfully con-&#xD;
tending emotions that were fast sapping tbe vital&#xD;
currents of her life, for the sake of the two beautiful&#xD;
children who seemed to have inherited all the graces&#xD;
and virtues of their mother, and none of their father's&#xD;
vices. At this time the parting words of' Mr. Livings-&#xD;
ton, which fell so ominously on her ears on th6 day&#xD;
of her marriage, came freshly to mind, and banish-&#xD;
ing every di~trusting thought of his sincerity as&#xD;
unworthy a place in her mind, she resolved at the*&#xD;
earliest practicable moment to seek his sympathy&#xD;
and counsel, hoping to find in him a friend and prom&#xD;

life should not be spared. He lived at some distance&#xD;

what were her        indignation and terror&#xD;
ment,              surprise,&#xD;
at being apprise of Mr. Carleton's arrival at her&#xD;
own door ! Str ugely enough she had not thought&#xD;
of his following ier, although having her fears at&#xD;
times that lie wo Id take some measure to rob her&#xD;
of her children. Instead of being paralysed with&#xD;
fear, all the slumbering forces of her soul wore&#xD;
instantly roused into action. Instead of the gentle&#xD;
and patient being, who had silently and submissively&#xD;
borne every indignity, he saw before him all the un-&#xD;
passioned energy of woman's nature when once pro.&#xD;
yoked to resist her wrongs.&#xD;
It is but justice to him to say that for a time he was&#xD;
deeply luimbled under a heavy feeling of remorse,&#xD;
and his wif&amp;amp;s repi:oaches~ were borne without making&#xD;
any attempt to reply to them. But this excitement&#xD;
was too much for that delicate frame, already totter-&#xD;
ing under the weight of intolerable wrongs, and sh~&#xD;
was again prostrated by another attack of brain fever,&#xD;
when her life was despaired of. He would have&#xD;
been very attentive had not the sight of him made&#xD;
her rave ten-fold worse, and the only ~vay she could&#xD;
bQ kept quiet at all was to place her children beside&#xD;
her, to whom in her delirium her ~iind was con-&#xD;
stantly reverting. If they were not present when&#xD;
she opened' her eyes she started up with all the&#xD;
energy of despair to go in search of then-i. however&#xD;
she rallied from this attack and again gave hopes of&#xD;
recovery.&#xD;
In the meantime Mr. Carleton recovered from his&#xD;
momentary twinge of conscience, and seeing no&#xD;
0&#xD;
&#xD;
prospect of' his own comfortable residence there unless&#xD;
she were out of the way, began to devise measures&#xD;
to rid himself of her. With the aid of a physician&#xD;
bearing the same reputation as himself, and one of&#xD;
his most i~~timate friends, she was conimitted for&#xD;
safe keeping, on the plea of insanity, to a lunatic&#xD;
asylum where, to the disgrace of all civilization&#xD;
be it said, any man under the sanction of the same&#xD;
law which entrusted to his sovereign care and&#xD;
protection the tender and helpless being he had&#xD;
chosen for his wife, might consign her with no other&#xD;
evidence than his own biased testimony and that of&#xD;
his interested friends, whenever, to serve any base&#xD;
purpose of his own, he wished to 'rid himself of her&#xD;
presenc~. There none of her friends might be 'allowed&#xD;
to hold any intercourse with her, and inexorable as&#xD;
fate, the law closed every avenue of defence through&#xD;
which an impartial investigation of facts might pro-&#xD;
duce a reaction in her favor, and ~he was doomed to&#xD;
suffer day after day, and year after year the most&#xD;
cruel indignities, the most refined torture tl~at a per-.&#xD;
v6rsion of the family institution into an engine of&#xD;
domestic tyranny could produce.&#xD;
The holiest institution that God has ordained, one&#xD;
which immediately and remotely effects all the inter-&#xD;
ests of society, i~t is impossible to trifle with or enter&#xD;
ligl~tly into without incurring the most serious results&#xD;
to ourselves and to ~he community.&#xD;
Viewing it in this light and perusing the annals of&#xD;

tue~ and enjoyments, home is the sa~rcd spQt that&#xD;
should be the most carefully guarded and protected&#xD;
by all the provisions it is possible for legislation to&#xD;
throw around it, and how has it been?&#xD;
The whole history of jurisprudence does not fur-&#xD;
nish another such a paradox as the assumption that&#xD;
a usurpation of her rights is the highest blessing and&#xD;
the greatest protection that can be accorded to wo~&#xD;
man by the supreme majesty of the law. Peruse the&#xD;
decisions of eminent lawgivers, and note the universal&#xD;
approbation with which she has been consigned to&#xD;
the most abject despotism under the plea of protect.&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
A learned judge in New York once said, "That&#xD;
we often see acts of tyranny and cruelty exercised&#xD;
by the husband towards the person of the wife, of&#xD;
which the law akes no cognizance, and yet; no man&#xD;
of wisdom and reflection can doubt the propriety of&#xD;
the rule gives to the hnsbarid the control and&#xD;
custody of the ~vife." "It is the price which female&#xD;
wants and weal ness must pay for their supply and&#xD;
protection." Magnanimous man ~&#xD;
is The whole force of public opinion on this subject&#xD;
founded on a series of contradictions, absurdities&#xD;
and falsehoods, so palpable, that when driven to the&#xD;
strong hold of defence, it cannot show the least I~es-&#xD;
tige of a principle to justify it, and resorts to that&#xD;
most effeminate of all devices, flattery.&#xD;
It begins by quoting Scripture from Genesis to St.&#xD;
Paul to show that woman through her sinfulness and&#xD;
weakness is the vassal of man, and needs his benefi-&#xD;
&#xD;
cent control and protection to guide her in the way&#xD;
she ~ho~ld go, and ends by conceding what woman&#xD;
i~ever claimed and St. Paul never asserted, that she&#xD;
is an angel, and must not be permitted to sully her&#xD;
spotless purity, and lesson her divine influence by.&#xD;
coming in contact with that .demoralizing element&#xD;
which, under the semblance of manhood, defiles&#xD;
every department of public life. And yet it never&#xD;
occurs to our wise legislators that she will be any&#xD;
the less a delicate and refined woman for living in&#xD;
the most intimate relation of life with the most de-&#xD;
graded specimen of humanity. All their gallant&#xD;
sympathy and protection explodes, when the angel&#xD;
they worship so far condescends to come dowmto&#xD;
the plane of mortals as to become a wife.&#xD;
Admitting that it does not conic within the scope&#xD;
of the law to regulate the marriage institution, which&#xD;
is the province of a higher tribunal, the conscience&#xD;
and the affections, it is the true~ pi:ovince of legis-&#xD;
lation to recognize the equal rights of both sexes&#xD;
in entering into the relation, thus removing a great&#xD;
source of selfish mOtives in the thirst for gain and&#xD;
love of power.&#xD;
When Mrs. Carleton became aware of her incar-&#xD;
ceration, having been lured from home under the&#xD;
pretence of a journey for her health, her excitement&#xD;
brought on another attack of fever when it seemed&#xD;
a certainty that her carUily troubles would soon be&#xD;
at an end. But again she rallied, and as soon as&#xD;
consciousness was in any degree restored, thoughts&#xD;
of her children came to nerve her once more to&#xD;
combat with the inroads of disease.&#xD;

393&#xD;
&#xD;
During her convalescence she was entrusted chiefly&#xD;
to the care of a young girl, who was regarded&#xD;
as too stupid to be of any available service to the&#xD;
inmates in any project they might devise to effect&#xD;
their deliverance, being one of those sensitive spirits&#xD;
that could expand only in a congenial atmo~pliere,&#xD;
and was employed to go of errands, in which capacity&#xD;
she was always so t~'usty that no very strict watch&#xD;
was kept of her whereabouts so that quite an un-&#xD;
limited freedom was hers. Between her ~nd Mrs.&#xD;
Carleton a reciprocal feeling of attachment sprung&#xD;
up, and many a tedious hour was whiled away in an&#xD;
interchange of affection's offices which were as highly&#xD;
appreciated by one as the other. In this way the&#xD;
days dragged their weary length along, and month&#xD;
after month passed by with no more hope fqr the&#xD;
future, during which Mrs. Carleton, struggling ~with&#xD;
her fate as bravely as possible, tried to be calim and&#xD;
quietly await the ordering of events if not so for-&#xD;
tunate as to devise any method of escape.&#xD;
But oh! what a xvrctched existence wa.s she drag-&#xD;
ging out! With what yearning tenderness did her&#xD;
mother's soul long to embrace her* darlings, who&#xD;
might, perhaps, even now be languishing on beds of&#xD;
pain, moaning for her tender care. But for him&#xD;
who had been the guilty cause of all this woe, she&#xD;
felt only loathing and disgust.&#xD;
How to escape from her living tomb was her first&#xD;
thought; where to go, and how to get possession of&#xD;
her children was the next; one as hopelessly impos-&#xD;
siNe as the other. In the phirenzy of despair she&#xD;
someti es gave .w~y to freaks of passion that might&#xD;
&#xD;
CONNECTICIIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
impress strangers who knew nothing of the circum-&#xD;
stances with the conviction of her insanity. Wish-&#xD;
ing to turn this fact to his-own advantage Mr~ Carle-&#xD;
ton took with him one day a friend of his to visit her,&#xD;
an unsci'upulOus lawyer. The sight of her hus-&#xD;
band and his ciiiel indifference to her agony at thus&#xD;
being separated from her children stung her to mad-&#xD;
ness. Her eyes flashed, and in no very tender tones&#xD;
she called God to witness that vengeance would one&#xD;
day be visited on his head. The lawyer shook his&#xD;
head with that complacent acquiescence in the wishes&#xD;
of his client so agreeable to his pocket, if not to his&#xD;
conscience.&#xD;
The thought of appealing to Mr. Livingston again&#xD;
flashed across her mind, but how was a question.&#xD;
Every avenue of communication with her friends was&#xD;
cut off except by letter, and even that must be sub-&#xD;
mitted to the inspection of those who were ignorant of&#xD;
her misfortunes and in sympathy with her husband.&#xD;
While pondering upon this subject one day, her&#xD;
young attendant, as if divining her thoughts, said&#xD;
with an abruptness and decision that surprised Mrs.&#xD;
Carleton, "If you want to send a letter to any body&#xD;
I will put it in the Post Office."&#xD;
Looking at her with doubt and astonishment she&#xD;
replied, "They would not ~allow you to do that."&#xD;
The little wise-acre with the most innocent sim-&#xD;
plicity remarked with a knowing smile, "I go just&#xD;
where I please."&#xD;
Mrs. Carleton hesitated a moment about the pro-&#xD;
priety of sending her on an errand so utterl~r at va-&#xD;
riance with the established rules, bt4 a~ it involved&#xD;

A TALE OF THE&#xD;
&#xD;
no deception, the girl neither being forbidden to go,&#xD;
nor likely to be questioned on her return, she quickly&#xD;
decided in the affirmative.&#xD;
She wrote a letter to Mr. Livingston. remiudhig&#xD;
him of his Proffered friendship, and imploring him&#xD;
to come to her assistance, or obtain her release in&#xD;
some way. She told~ him frankly how 'she had suf..&#xD;
fered and what insults and outrages had been heaped&#xD;
upon her, facts of which he needed no fai'ther proof&#xD;
than his own observation could vouch for. She gave&#xD;
him directions about her address, naming the da~&#xD;
when she would send for it at the office. In her&#xD;
desperation she assumed that something must be&#xD;
done in which no alternative was presented.&#xD;
It was very trying to him to be obliged to crush&#xD;
the faintest vestige of a hope of procuring her 're~&#xD;
lease, or of gaining access to her children. He told&#xD;
her of all the exertions that h'ad been made, and the&#xD;
deep interest excited in her behalf, closing with&#xD;
the proffer of his services in any way that could be&#xD;
of advantage, and assuring her of his undiminished&#xD;
regard and deepest sympathy.&#xD;
It was such a consolation to receive a friendly&#xD;
message and sympathizing words from any one, that&#xD;
she almost overlooked the substance of the letter&#xD;
saying nothing could be done, remembering only th9&#xD;
offer of assistance to which she clung as a certain&#xD;
omen that something remained, and to discover what&#xD;
this might be, knowing it to be dependent on herself,&#xD;
she bent all the energies of her mind, hut with litJe&#xD;
sticcess.&#xD;
* "What, shall I give it up so," she said, ".drag my&#xD;

life out here when my children have such a claim&#xD;
upon me, because he whom the world recognizes as&#xD;
my husband has unlimited power and may violate&#xD;
the obligation resting as strongly upon him as me,&#xD;
because he is a man, and I a woman? No! By all&#xD;
these powers God has given me as a wife and hiother&#xD;
I will get away from here to proclaim to the world&#xD;
the iniquity of its laws and the baseness of mankind,&#xD;
though my life be the forfeit."&#xD;
She scanned the distance from her window to the&#xD;
ground, her room being fortunately in the second&#xD;
story, and formed her determination.&#xD;
"If any human being is willing to assist me," she&#xD;
thought, "I should detest myself if I could not&#xD;
devise some way to raise myself above this degrade~&#xD;
tion. I would jump from this window if only sure of&#xD;
escape afterwards. Let mc think. If I should write&#xD;
to him to be here with his carriage and the fleetest&#xD;
horses he could procure, at such tifrie of day as the&#xD;
house is most quiet, would there not be a possibility&#xD;
of getting beyond the reach of pursuit before they&#xD;
would get started?" It was a desperate venture,&#xD;
but she was desperate. Closely watched it required~&#xD;
the greatest precaution to manage the affair without&#xD;
exciting suspicion that something was on foot, as&#xD;
well as in writing her letters. If Mr. Livingston&#xD;
should consent to her proposal which might well be&#xD;
doubted, not knowing what rash plan she had formed,&#xD;
of which she had not dared to give him the least mW&#xD;
mation because it was rash, how could she be sure of&#xD;
any time when, no one would be on the premises to&#xD;
stand in the way of her flight. Her anxiety d tiring that&#xD;

&#xD;
short period was equalled only by her previous su~&#xD;
fering. If this plan failed no other avenue of escape&#xD;
presented itself to her burning brain. Through&#xD;
weary years, perhaps, 114 miserable existence migilt&#xD;
be protracted, though it seemed scarcely possible.&#xD;
That rich auburn hair ~as already stVeaked with&#xD;
gray, and that fair, smooth skin s~ withered* and&#xD;
* wrinkled with the agony of torturing days and sleep~&#xD;
less nights that one would scarcely recognize the&#xD;
wreck of What was once so beautiful and lovely.&#xD;
Though t~ of her children made her cling 'to life with&#xD;
about equal desperation, and for them she wrestled&#xD;
with many a temptation to crave for herself the&#xD;
blessed boon of lying down in her last sleep.&#xD;
Her experience was not without its salutary les-&#xD;
sons. While at, the south her own troubles had&#xD;
somewhat blinded her to the sufferings of others&#xD;
notwithstanding her generous nature, and the enor-&#xD;
mities of tile slave system never impressed her with&#xD;
such vividness as now, when she could realize the&#xD;
glorious blessing of liberty, and the utter heartless-&#xD;
ness of any system that separates parent and child.&#xD;
"ll&amp;amp;w can such wickedness be tolerated," said she&#xD;
to herself, and then quickly recurring to her own&#xD;
ease she, marvelled all th~' more, "how is it that I,&#xD;
* here in the land of my birth, surrounded by friends&#xD;
* . who have known me from childhood up, and once&#xD;
the favorite of every circle, am left to pine here in&#xD;
this living tomb? Why don't they come and batter&#xD;
* down these doors? How can they go about their&#xD;
business with such cruel indifference when they&#xD;
know what a fellow-being is suffering, and a woman&#xD;
&#xD;
too? Know? How can they know when they never&#xD;
experienced it? Down with all your pretended ten-&#xD;
K derness for woman's feelings! It is all hypocrisy.&#xD;
"Mothers, sitting by your own happy firesides,&#xD;
how cart you be so quiet, when others are suffering&#xD;
so much, and denied the privilege of sitting by their&#xD;
firesides? Yet have I not done it? We never feel&#xD;
K    another's woe until it; becomes o~r own. Is it possi-&#xD;
ble if II should get away from this place I should&#xD;
ever sit quietly down forgetting the misery around&#xD;
me? Get away from here! What if I never should!&#xD;
'S&#xD;
Oh God, art thou just?"&#xD;
As she thought of the doubtful chances of her&#xD;
escape after the letter was sent, and nothing remained&#xD;
to be done but to await the result, her shattered&#xD;
* nerves gave rise to the most torturing apprehensions&#xD;
concerning her future safety, and the trou~Aes she&#xD;
might bring upon others in pursuing this course. A&#xD;
deadly hate towards Mr. Livingston had always&#xD;
existed in the breast of Mr. Carleton, and she did&#xD;
not know what injury his anger might prompt him&#xD;
to commit if he should be the instrumentality of&#xD;
effecting her deliverance.&#xD;
The dangerous feat from the chamber, windoW was&#xD;
another source of the most agonizing solicitude lest her:&#xD;
courage should fail if the carriage did come. Every&#xD;
night her restte~s slumber was disturbed with visions&#xD;
of perilous adventure and hair breadth escapes.&#xD;
But all this anxiety was swallowed up in the over-&#xD;
whelming ~uspeuse lest the letter should not meet a&#xD;
favorable reception. Perhaps she would never hear&#xD;
any more from it. At this suggestion fear and&#xD;

weakness fled, and no attempt, promising the least&#xD;
hope of success, was too hazardous~ for her to make.&#xD;
There was one who could not sft. quietly by her&#xD;
own fireside when another was suffering so intensely.&#xD;
This was Mrs. Livingston. All her mother's soul&#xD;
was stirred, and she would have shrunk from nothing&#xD;
which promised the least ray of hope, let the risk of&#xD;
danger be what it', might. Timidity was not one of&#xD;
her faults.&#xD;
On the receipt of this letter from Mrs. Carleton,&#xD;
Mr. Livingston naturally hesitated about the wisdom&#xD;
of acting according to her suggestion. That flight&#xD;
was her intention could not be doubted, although in&#xD;
what manner remained to be seen.&#xD;
The extreme hazard of the attempt presented itself&#xD;
in every form to his better judgment, and discretion&#xD;
prompted him to second no step that might result in&#xD;
the most serious consequences to herself as well as&#xD;
others. His wife was not to' be so summarily dis-&#xD;
pos9d of. Her temperament was of that hrdent,&#xD;
impulsive character which inspires courage and&#xD;
energy into an enterprise that requires perseverance&#xD;
rather than forethought, though not always the one to&#xD;
depend on in an emergency, or to solve .the wa~ out&#xD;
of a difficulty. Excess of feeling is not balanced by&#xD;
sufficient caution to avoid perplexities a little discre-&#xD;
tion might easily. foresee. WarmThearted and geii-&#xD;
erous, justice does not always go before generosity,&#xD;
nor prudence act with sufficient firmness and moder-&#xD;
ation. ' Mrs. Livingston, however, united with her&#xD;
bounding impulse sufficient consideration and firm-&#xD;
ness to guide it. She never acted' rashly or blindly.&#xD;
&#xD;
Her decision was promptly rendered that it was best&#xD;
to go with the carriage and horses, and trust to Mrs.&#xD;
Carletoil for the rest. No alternative was presented&#xD;
to her mind.&#xD;
"Do you think," said she, "that if I were in her&#xD;
place, separated from my children, I should consider&#xD;
any. proffers of friendship or expressions of sympathy&#xD;
as coming from sincere motives which. would not&#xD;
prompt so much of an effort as that for me? I&#xD;
would move heaven and earth to the rescue if possm~&#xD;
ble. I will go, and it seems to me more, advisable&#xD;
for Walter to go with .me than for you, Ernest."&#xD;
Mr. Livingston yielded, and Walter raised no&#xD;
objection to the arrangement. He had exhausted&#xD;
his fund of legal knowledge in the vain hope of&#xD;
detecting some lcop-hole through which the innocent&#xD;
might be rescued and the guilty meet his deserts;&#xD;
but though in the liberal construction of the law&#xD;
every other prisoner might be entitled to an impar-&#xD;
tial hearing, woman, in her married state, was such&#xD;
a nonentity that 'this privilege could not be accorded&#xD;
to her, and he felt the force and justice of Rosahind's&#xD;
appeal.&#xD;
They started on the appointed day, which was very&#xD;
warm and sultry, and fortunately encountered no&#xD;
one on their. approach to the seQue of adventure.&#xD;
The avenue being a winding one, the carriage would&#xD;
not come in sight until very near the entrance to the&#xD;
house, and by walking the horses so little noise was&#xD;
made that no attention was attracted to the spot from&#xD;
the inmates.&#xD;

400             A TALE OF THE&#xD;
ton as the hour drew near cannot easily be imagined.&#xD;
Unable to obt&amp;amp;n any sleep the night before, her&#xD;
nervous system was stretched to its utmost tension,&#xD;
and the frightful leap from the window tormented&#xD;
her with the most fearful apprehensions lest courage&#xD;
should fail at last. As her chamber fronted the main&#xD;
avenue leading to the building, no carriage could;&#xD;
escape her observation, but it was possible for some&#xD;
other to come; and it might be unsafe to rely on her&#xD;
indistinct vision, now so impaired by sickness and&#xD;
suffering, to guide her accurately. Many such fears&#xD;
arose, all of which fled when the hand pointed to the&#xD;
hour and no carriage appeared. Not a person was&#xD;
stirring outside the building and every thing was&#xD;
propitious as could be for the adventure. No shrink-&#xD;
ing now from the hazardous leap-she was not afraid&#xD;
to jump on the soft greensward below, or perform&#xD;
any other similar feat, with the prospect of escape&#xD;
afterwards. Could it be possible he would disappoint&#xD;
her? low every moment swelled into an hour!&#xD;
*      *      *,     *      *&#xD;
There comes the carriage and no mistaking the&#xD;
driver, Walter Claremont, whose frank, manly face&#xD;
and large brown eyes it was easy to recognize. A&#xD;
moment more and she was on the ground. The leap&#xD;
was effected with less of harm thaim she expected,&#xD;
laming her considerably, but not enough to disable&#xD;
her from rising. She reached the carriage by the&#xD;
time it stopped aiA Walter lifted her in. Exhausted&#xD;
nature then gave way and she fell into a swoon.&#xD;
Mrs. Claremont's fbrethought fortunately provided for&#xD;
this emergency in supplying Rosalind with cordials,&#xD;

which she applied as well as the circumstances would&#xD;
allow-if not sufficient to restore consciousness, the&#xD;
little strength remaining was thereby enabled to sus-&#xD;
tain her until the ~end of the journey. Not a moment&#xD;
wa~ to be lost and fleetly sped the horses. That the&#xD;
hour should have been chosen when no one was&#xD;
stirring on the grounds, seemed aln~ost an interposi-&#xD;
tion of providential guidance as such an opportunity&#xD;
was seldojn presented. The carriage was seen by&#xD;
some of the inmates -but Mrs. Carleton was not, and&#xD;
making no stop, it was supposed motives of curiosity&#xD;
brought the travelers there to see the building. A~&#xD;
no one had occasion to go to her room until tea time&#xD;
two or three hours after, she was many miles beyond&#xD;
their reach when her absence was discovered by the&#xD;
functionaries in chaPge.&#xD;
It so happened that the attendants were unusually&#xD;
engaged that afternoon in preparing for a little cnter~&#xD;
tainnmnt to be held in the evening for the diversion&#xD;
of such of the inmates as were considered in a proper&#xD;
state to participate in it, but Mrs. Carleton knew noth-&#xD;
ing of it wheii she wrote her letter, being afterwards&#xD;
informed by her young attendant, whom she encour-&#xD;
aged to assist in the preparations thus ensuring her&#xD;
absence; and as she was seldom visited by any one&#xD;
else, she might feel quite sure of being left alone.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXX J2L&#xD;
"Am I mad that I should cherish that which bears such bitter&#xD;
fruit?&#xD;
I will pluck it from my bosom though my heart be at its root."&#xD;
No little commotion was excited when it was dis-&#xD;
covered that Mrs. Carleton had escaped from her&#xD;
prison. By what means she had effected the escape&#xD;
was* a mystery. Every one was ignorant of any&#xD;
circumstance connected with the affair that conld&#xD;
afford the least clue t6 its solution. Even the little&#xD;
wise-acre when questioned answered with her usual&#xD;
indifference, manifesting no interest to obtain any&#xD;
J~nowledge of her, which rather surprised the other&#xD;
attendants who had observed the apparent attachment&#xD;
between the~n. She had her conjectures from remarks&#xD;
Mrs. Carleton made that morning coupled with&#xD;
expressions of gratitude for all her kindness to her,&#xD;
which, howeyci', would have left no particular im-&#xD;
pression if she had not disappeared, but how the&#xD;
flight was accomplished she was equally puzzled to&#xD;
guess. Suspicions finally rested on the carriage as&#xD;
having some connection with the mystery, and Mr.&#xD;
~rleton, Upon receiving the information, at once&#xD;
suspected. Mr. Living~ton, though unable 'to compre-&#xD;
hend by what Possible means any communication&#xD;
could have, been effected between him and his wife.&#xD;
(402)&#xD;
&#xD;
It was sometime before he gained any certain tidings&#xD;
of her as the affair was kept very secret, none outside&#xD;
the family circle knowing of her presence at Orange&#xD;
Grove. She was still unconsciOuS when she arrived.&#xD;
there, but by the aid of powerful restoratives, life,&#xD;
accompanied by a high fever, returned to contend&#xD;
once more for the mastery with death. When the&#xD;
fever abated the attending physician gave very little&#xD;
encouragement that reason would ever resume its&#xD;
sway if her life was spared. Mrs. Claremont and&#xD;
Milly were the only ones it was safe to admit to her&#xD;
bedside. Th~ sight of Mr. Livingston and his wife&#xD;
excited her to such *a degree that it 'was impossible&#xD;
to hold her in bed. "Has he come," she would say,&#xD;
"is he. hero? You will not J~et him take me will&#xD;
you? Oh my poor children! II must not stay here,&#xD;
II must get away.~~&#xD;
Mrs. Claremont's soothing words and assurance of&#xD;
safety as with gentle force she remanded her to her&#xD;
bed, promising to guard' her aga~ist every harm,&#xD;
generally calmed the invalid, whose strength could&#xD;
sustain her no longer in that state of excitement.&#xD;
As days wore on she became more quiet, but gave&#xD;
very little evidence of returning strength. Upon her&#xD;
will, in a ~eat measure, depended her recovery.&#xD;
Whether consciousness would b~ restored sufficiently&#xD;
to make her understand this was very doubtful. With&#xD;
the first gleam of reason came the maddening recol-&#xD;

remark, "What a lovely morning!" iLr manner&#xD;
indicating that so meting~ farther was seeking utter-&#xD;

arranging her hair without making any reply.&#xD;

shades of darkness have merged in ~Vhe tranquil&#xD;
morning light, so d6e~ my soul respond to the giver&#xD;
of all blessings for his kindness and watchfulness&#xD;

"There are many blessings in store for you yet, I&#xD;

A perceptible change for the better was soon to be&#xD;
observed in the invalid, and her recovery was very&#xD;
rapid.~ Meanwhile, owing to the indefatigable exer~&#xD;
tions of Mrs. Livingston, efforts were being made for&#xD;
the restoration of her children. A great deal ~of&#xD;
sympathy was awakened in all circles by the story of&#xD;
her sufferings, her marvellous escape, and the for-&#xD;
giving spirit she now manifested. Men ~n the legal&#xD;

prevent them from discerning a moral principle be~&#xD;
hind the law, were eager to discover some process&#xD;
through which they could effect the desired object.&#xD;
It was done although we can scarcely tell how. The&#xD;
law is a tricky old tyrant, and the man who is ingen~&#xD;
ious enough to understand all its crooks and turns&#xD;
wields a powerful sceptre either for good or evil. By&#xD;
the rendering of a single phrase fortunes have been&#xD;
gained and lost, life made the sport of chance and&#xD;

Had he nQt lost every spark of manhood, which in&#xD;
his younger days was at times sufficient to overpower&#xD;
his sensuality with something like the pure gush of&#xD;
feeling, he would have shown some emotion, but he&#xD;
was as unmoved as a statue. Even the affection he&#xD;
had once manifested for his children seemed to have&#xD;
died out of his bosom.&#xD;
He departed to seek a more congenial home at the&#xD;
south, the more willingly that a prospect opened&#xD;
before him to retrieve his fallen fortl4nes, having quite.&#xD;
a stock in trade in the way of information concern-&#xD;
ing several fugitives from different parts of the south,&#xD;
whose former masters he had known, which he kept&#xD;
properly booked. This proved a most invaluable&#xD;
acquisition to his credentials for admission again to&#xD;
southern society, a. path that might have been rath-&#xD;
er difficult of access after his precipitate retreat.&#xD;
The old slave law of '93, though sufficiently strin-&#xD;
gent in its provisions, had never been very effectual&#xD;
in securing the end for which it was enacted, owing.&#xD;
to the prejudices still lingering in the northern mind&#xD;
against the anti-republican theory that only white&#xD;
men were created free and equal. The southern&#xD;

Vince them of their own readiness to act at their&#xD;
bidding, the sincerity of which was proved when&#xD;
they were called* upon to "conquer their prejudices."&#xD;
As the contest went Qn the little remnant of'&#xD;
northern conscience which had hitherto endorsed in&#xD;
theory, if not in practice, the doctrine that, every&#xD;
man had an inalienable right to liberty was ready to&#xD;
pronounce it a" glittering generality," and the teach~&#xD;
ings of Christ were. reversed,...~" I was a stranger&#xD;

New England Sabbath the church bells sounded their&#xD;
call to morning prayer; from choir and organ&#xD;
rose the swelling anthems of praise, but only to the&#xD;
white man's God. The black wa~s that day struck&#xD;
out of existence. Only in secluded alleys and dark-&#xD;
ened cellars, in. the crowded attic where his living&#xD;
flesh could be stowed away so that it might be over-&#xD;
looked among the enormous piles of other "mer-&#xD;
chandise," could his soul pour itself to God in&#xD;
prayer.&#xD;
Then wtis the hour of triumph for such as Mr.&#xD;
Carleton. On the scent of their human prey they&#xD;
skulked abroad under the ensign of the American&#xD;
Eagle, to. proclaim the infatuated lie that "black men&#xD;
had x~o rights, which the white man was bound to&#xD;
respect." But over these scenes humanity would&#xD;
willingly draw a veil.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXX VITh&#xD;
"In our spirits doth us spirit shine,&#xD;
As shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew."&#xD;
"What a magic power is a kind word! And when&#xD;
it is not the mere impulse of the moment, but the&#xD;
perpetual atmosphere of home, how softly go the&#xD;
hours! hearts .grow young and cares press lightly,&#xD;
pain loses half its sting and affliction half its sorrow.&#xD;
Were this truth more fully realized how much of&#xD;
this world's misery might we escape, how much of&#xD;
bitter self-accusations and life-long regrets." Such&#xD;
was Milly's soliloquy one afternoon, as she sat musing&#xD;
upon the wonderful transformation that might be&#xD;
effected in this world of disappointment, if the affec-&#xD;
tions were more tenderly cultivated. This was a&#xD;
theme upon which she had been dreaming all her&#xD;
life, and the desire to effect something towards this&#xD;
transformation had prompted her to write the novel,&#xD;
which, however, was not likely to accomplish much&#xD;
so long as it was carefully concealed in her drawer.&#xD;
Reader, did you ever try to amuse your leisure~&#xD;
moments of thought by picturing to yourself the&#xD;
real life of the unmarrIed woman? Well, whatever&#xD;
your speculations may have been you niay rest pretty&#xD;
sure tat they are a failure. She might just as well&#xD;

the charmed circle of conjugal love. Can she sym~&#xD;
pathize with you either in joy or sorrow, when with&#xD;
a mother's gushing tenderness you clasp in your&#xD;
arms the idolized child, which in a few short months&#xD;
is hidden from your gaze forever? Certainly not.&#xD;
She may portray your feelings more vividly than you&#xD;
could yourself, but the realization is not there. You&#xD;
in your innocent simplicity may look upon her occa-&#xD;
'sionally, perhaps with sympathy if realizing your&#xD;
anticipations of wedded bliss, because. she cannot&#xD;
share your joys, or it may be that burdened with&#xD;
care and wearied with watching you almost envy her&#xD;
her frecd~m from the responsibilities resting upon&#xD;
you. Farther than this you seldom go, having&#xD;
neither the time nor the inclination to enter her&#xD;
secret sanctuary and participate in her joys and sor-&#xD;
rows; and perhaps if' you did you would not be ad-&#xD;
mitted. She has more time for reflection than you,&#xD;
and knows how insignificant, they will seernto you.&#xD;
You readily uiidcrsta.nd that hiarriage is the natural&#xD;
relation of every maii and w9man without which&#xD;
neither can be fully developed, but did it ever occur&#xD;
to you what air anomalous life that must be, in a state&#xD;
of society which carries this principle so fair as to&#xD;
consider it the only sphere for woman's development,&#xD;
when all those faculties and affectiojis that naturally&#xD;
centre in a family must be diverted into some other&#xD;
channel. If established in business th~t gives sttffi-&#xD;
dent range ~o all her powers, or fortunately so con-&#xD;
stituted as to find the greatest happiness in minister-&#xD;
ing unto others, 'she may prove an exception, yet&#xD;
even then her life is distinct from yours.&#xD;
&#xD;
When you see a quiet person, like Milly making&#xD;
so little stir that you almost forget her existence, do&#xD;
not for a moment imagine she is the unobserving&#xD;
person you might judge her to be, or that her life&#xD;
flows so smoothly on she has no care or anxiety to&#xD;
disturb her. Those instincts and affections implanted&#xD;
for the fulfilment of the high trusts imposed on the&#xD;
family relation are by no means stifled in her bosom,&#xD;
and upon her success in guiding these through nor-&#xD;
mal channels to other objects and interests, in a great&#xD;
measure depends her happiness&#xD;
On the same day an animated discussion was held&#xD;
in another room among the other members of the&#xD;
family, of which Milly was the uncOnscious subject.&#xD;
That year ~iad witnessed one of those financial&#xD;
crises that occasion ally sweep over the land like a&#xD;
tornado, wrec~dng the millionairQ of yesterday and&#xD;
carrying dismay and starvation into thousands of&#xD;
hamlets but lately the abodes of happiness and com-&#xD;
fort, as the laborers are thus thrown out of employ-&#xD;
ment and their little all swallowed up in the general&#xD;
crash. The sad spectacles constantly presented of&#xD;
large families dependent on their daiW toil for sup-&#xD;
port, with no prospect before them but beggary or&#xD;
vice to meet the rigors of the coming winter, aroused&#xD;
Amelia Crawford, whose whole life was now devoted&#xD;
to the work of reclaiming the intemperate and vicious,&#xD;
to make some organized effort towards alleviating&#xD;
their distress.&#xD;
For this purpose she appealed to a number of indi-&#xD;
viduals noted for their beneficence, whose fortunes&#xD;
escaped unharmed, among whom was Mr. Livingston.&#xD;

&#xD;
flier proposition was, if the means could be raised, to&#xD;
found a home for the destitute, and furnish employ-&#xD;
mont both for them and others, who with a little&#xD;
help could provide one for themselves. Amelia&#xD;
was one of those practical, persevering spirits who&#xD;
never put hand to the plough and look baei, and&#xD;
consequently she never failed in any undei'taking,&#xD;
which fact inspired confidence in those whom she&#xD;
consulted, that they might safely rely on her success&#xD;
in' any achievement of this kind.&#xD;
Not every one she consulted, however, had the&#xD;
means at his command to effect so much towards&#xD;
the consummation of the desired object as Mr. Liv-&#xD;
ingston, of which circumstance he was fully aware.&#xD;
First, he had a powerful helpmeet in his wife, who&#xD;
was always equal to any emergency pressed upon&#xD;
her; next came h~r mother, whdse long life of disin-&#xD;
terested effoi4s in benevolent channels gave her a&#xD;
wide spread influence she could wield to great ad-.&#xD;
vantage in furthering this enterprise; and then he&#xD;
knew of another whose highest happiness it' would&#xD;
be to witness its accomplishment, Mrs. Carleton,&#xD;
over whose placid features the benign radiance of a&#xD;
peace which comes not of This world shed a diviner&#xD;
beauty; and last though not least, came Milly, whose&#xD;
m4k, quiet offices in ministering to a family of un-&#xD;
fortunate ones, he could foresee would iiivest her&#xD;
with a sort of unconscious dignity that would develop&#xD;
the latent powers of he~ soul. With an artist's quiuk&#xD;
perception he had ofte~i, when observing her, taken&#xD;
in the whole range of what her thoughts, feelings&#xD;
and aspirations might bejust as, wheD solving a diffi-&#xD;

lance in their mental organizations, which would&#xD;
enable him to understand hei' more readily than his&#xD;
practical, business-like wife, full of demonstration&#xD;
and enthusiasm, could possibly do. When he laid&#xD;
Amelia's suggestion before the latter, which met her&#xD;
cordial approbation, she immediately consulted Mrs.&#xD;
Carleton, who warmly espoused it thp~igh it was little&#xD;
she could contribute besides her influence, being,&#xD;
broken down in health, and having no pecuniary&#xD;
means to resort to. Rosahind, whose fertile brain&#xD;
never lackedexpedients toeffe'~t any end she desired,&#xD;
made a proposition to her that if she felt willing to&#xD;
give the use of the old family mansion, which was&#xD;
very large and commodious for such a purpose, they&#xD;
would most cheerfully provide her a home in their&#xD;
family, a pbint that had already been discussed with&#xD;
her husband and Mrs. Claremont. This proposition&#xD;
was very cheerfully accepted, not only for the benefits&#xD;
thus resulting to others, but also to herself in dwell-&#xD;
ing among such genial influences as were empowered&#xD;
within 'the sylvan retreats of Orange Grove. By the&#xD;
addition of a single room in a retired part of the&#xD;
house which rather added to the completeness of the&#xD;
whole, and therefore had long been desired 'by Rosa-&#xD;
hind, Mrs. Carleton could be furnished with apart-&#xD;
ments for herself and children entirely distinct from&#xD;
theirs, and without any inconvenience to thenispives.&#xD;

&#xD;
CONNECTICUT.&#xD;
&#xD;
The selection of a suitable person to take charge&#xD;
of this lieterogenious assemblage, whose mental&#xD;
and moral natures were to be provided for as well as&#xD;
their physical wants, was found the most perplexing&#xD;
part of the work, being the subject in debate upon&#xD;
the afternoon alluded to, when Mr. Livingston pro-&#xD;
posed MiJIy as one possessing the necessary qualifi-&#xD;
cations, greatly to the amazement of his matter-of fact&#xD;
wife, who would never have perceived anything pi'ac-&#xD;
tical in such a dreamy, poetic nature as hers.&#xD;
"Oh, Ernest !"' she exclaimed, "you cannot be in'&#xD;
earnest. She is not adapted to the responsibility of&#xD;
such a position, and I don't believe she would ac-&#xD;
cept it if offered to her, being entirely unaccustom-&#xD;
'ed to anything of the sort. She may have capacity&#xD;
enough, but it must be developed in the right way&#xD;
to be available. 'A person must do something be-&#xD;
sides theorize. She is amiable, aff6ction ate, and&#xD;
would make a model wife for, somebody."&#xD;
"It seems, then, I made a serious mistake when I&#xD;
was married. I began to think so the month pre-&#xD;
vious, when you were so much more ready to attend&#xD;
to everybody else than to me, and doubted seriously&#xD;
if' my turn would ever come at all, and whether such&#xD;
a business-like wife was just the one to l&amp;amp;ve me."&#xD;
"Oh, now, you needn't put on such a doleful air,'&#xD;
when I know you were congratulating . yourself all&#xD;
the time upon tour good fortune in getting such a&#xD;
wife. Haven't I been devoted enough to you since,&#xD;
to make it all up.?" ~said she, fondly stooping over&#xD;
his shoulder, where she had been standing, twining&#xD;
one of his shining loeks around her finger. "But&#xD;
&#xD;
really this is~a serious question about Milly, in which&#xD;
we ought to put aside every personal consideration."&#xD;
"Certainly we must, and I am serious too.~ Well&#xD;
now, my sv~eet Rose, I have yielded to you hitherto,&#xD;
gven when my own sense of discretion would have&#xD;
prompted me to do otherwise, because I had confi-&#xD;
dence in 'your judgment, and will you. not for once&#xD;
trust me in mine ?"&#xD;
"To be sure I will,. but don't imagine that I sup-&#xD;
pose you. are so yielding as to give up to me unless&#xD;
I am able to convince you. of the plausibility, at least,~&#xD;
of my undePtaking. 'Mother, what do you say?&#xD;
You ought to know Milly quite as xvell as I do."&#xD;
"She is not one I should have thought of propo-&#xD;
sing for the place, but I am not ready to deny the&#xD;
possibility of your husband's, prediction. If she feels&#xD;
herself competent for the task, and~ desirous to go, I&#xD;
should have no fear. These artists are more accu-&#xD;
rate judges of the real qualities of the soul than such&#xD;
prosaic beings as you and I. ii could mention many&#xD;
among my acquaintance who thought Ernest Liv-&#xD;
ingston as wild in his selection of a wife as you now&#xD;
think him to be, but I 'rather think he is fully satis-&#xD;
fied that he did not refer the question to their judg~&#xD;
ment, or oven judge you by appearances.&#xD;
With a merry laugh Mr. Livingston then rose, and&#xD;
after hastily pressing his blushing wife to his bosom,&#xD;
threaded his way to Lilly's garden, whither he had&#xD;
just caught a glimpse of Milly passing, that being ~&#xD;
chosen retreat of hers, and also her special charge.&#xD;
now. Flowers bloomed there through all the blos-&#xD;
soming season in greater beauty than in any other&#xD;

At anothe..' time she might have shrunk from th~&#xD;

With~~t any hesitation she agreed to accept the&#xD;
position he offered, if such a course should meet the&#xD;
approbation of all parties concerned, which condition&#xD;
&#xD;
he knew was settled beyond a doubt, as a majority&#xD;
of those who had contributed most. liberally to the&#xD;
funds were glad enoug' to be relieved of the labor&#xD;
and care of inaugurating the work, to yield readily&#xD;

nessed the dedication of the old, stately mansion of&#xD;

wealth, luxury and ease, to the service of the most&#xD;
unfortunate of the other extreme of society.&#xD;
rrIii~ was a delightful scene to INlirs. Carleton, and&#xD;
one which atoned for the years of bitter suffering she&#xD;
had experienced. The rather dilapidated state into&#xD;
which the' grounds had fallen for want of an owner's&#xD;
interest in them during the last few years, suggested&#xD;
to her the passage of scripture, ",Tl~e wilderness and&#xD;

shall rejoice and blossom as the rose," which was&#xD;
literally illustrated as spring advanced, and a gen-&#xD;
eral air of thrift succeeded the former neglected ap-&#xD;

their former tasteful simplicity, the hedge-rows were&#xD;
neatly put in trim, the climbing vines, clematis and&#xD;
honeysuckle, carefully trained around the pillars of,&#xD;

&#xD;
through the failure of a reputed wealthy firm in the&#xD;
city, and found himself at threescore without a&#xD;
penny in the world, having a feeble wife and several&#xD;
young children dependent upon him. He was ac~&#xD;
cordingly employed to take general charge of the&#xD;
premises on Which was located a little cottage, his&#xD;
former. residence when iii that service before, and in&#xD;
which he and his family were again reinstated.&#xD;
The change inside was no less marked and pleas-&#xD;
ing to the observer. Old age and cliild.hood met&#xD;
there arid blessed each othei'; the most restless and&#xD;
turbulent spirits were soothed, and became 'contented&#xD;
and happy under Milly's genial influence. The most&#xD;
perplexing case she had to deal with was that' of a&#xD;
bright little boy, of ten years, whom 'Amelia had&#xD;
found in the street, without home or friends, and&#xD;
getting a lodgiiig wherever he could, but oftener&#xD;
under no roof at all. His unusual intelligence made&#xD;
him a great pr6ficient in all the vile habits engen-&#xD;
dered by a too familiar intqrcourse with street influ-&#xD;
ences, and few could exceed, him ~u lying and pro-&#xD;
fanity. He was also a confirmed smoker, sporting&#xD;
his cigai', when he could get one, with as much poni~&#xD;
posity as any young dandy who considers this one&#xD;
of the first accomplishments of the gentleman.&#xD;
By a little cajoling he could always get a pipe&#xD;
from some of the old people, with whose confirmed&#xD;
habits she knew it would be 'of little i~se to interfere,&#xD;
but she would not tolerate the practice among the&#xD;
young, deeming this the only effectual field in which&#xD;
to labor for its suppression. Besides being consci-&#xD;
entiously opposed to the use of tobacco in all its&#xD;
&#xD;
forms, the pure instincts of .her soul repeTh3d t1~&#xD;
sickly, sentimental taste, that puts aside woman~1y&#xD;
delicacy to profess admiration for the curling smoke,&#xD;
which only suggested to her a mist in the smoker's&#xD;
brain like that in the atmosphere he so 'persistently&#xD;
pollutes.&#xD;
The juvenile offender at length had the satisfac-&#xD;
tion of being domiciled in) a pleasant little apartment&#xD;
in a retired section of the house until he was cured.&#xD;
At first I.e was going to be very brave, and stay&#xD;
there just as long as Miss Milly wished, determined&#xD;
not to' ~how any sign ~f penitence; but before the'&#xD;
first day was out ho found it decidedly tedious not&#xD;
to be his own master, and run about as he had' done.&#xD;
In vain he framed every excuse to get out, and plead&#xD;
with Milly, but she was inexorable. Always pleas-&#xD;
ant and kind, she bore patiently his childish threats,&#xD;
sometimes takng him with her to walk, that he&#xD;
might have the benefit of air andexercise, but i~ever&#xD;
permitting him to ~o alone. Sometimes he feigned&#xD;
sickness, which however did not move, h~r at all;&#xD;
neither was she alarmed when he was really sick,&#xD;
and lost his appetite in consequence of being Wholly&#xD;
deprived of his accustomed stimulus. She nursed&#xD;
him faithfully, and provided delicacies that won his&#xD;
childish gratitude wheii he had no relish for them.&#xD;
As he recovered, a sincere reformation took place,&#xD;
and he became one of the most obedient and affec~&#xD;
tionafe of children.&#xD;
Milly soon after found her counterpart in a little&#xD;
rphan girl, ~brought there by the watchman accord&#xD;
ing to the instructions of Mrs. Living~tou, who had&#xD;

had been treated kindly, no blame would have rds~d&#xD;

earessihg her one day, said with touching tender~&#xD;

mother, I do so want a mother." it was impossible&#xD;
for that loving soul to deny such a request to this&#xD;
lonely one~ and she adopted her under the name' of&#xD;

with a rich harvest. In the most depraved and de-&#xD;
