CHAPTER I.&#xD;
&#xD;
TSB HUNTER-CAPTAIN LEsAGE-A LIBERAL OFFER.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT was the year 172-. Louisiana was then a&#xD;
French colony. In 1718, by the direction of&#xD;
de Bienville, fifty log huts chad been erected on&#xD;
the west bank of the Mississippi River, to which&#xD;
the name of New Orleans -had been given in&#xD;
compliment'to the Duke of Orleans. Previous&#xD;
to that date, the site where the, Crescent City&#xD;
now stands had been covered with a dense for-&#xD;
est, in which the red man hunted his game and&#xD;
reared his lodge.&#xD;
A few years had not greatly changed the as-&#xD;
pect of the new settlement. It only numbered&#xD;
about two hundred cttbins, although it had be-&#xD;
come the seat of government-it having been&#xD;
transferred thither from Biloxi after considerable&#xD;
discussion in regard to the propriety of the&#xD;
measure.&#xD;
The population of New Orleans -at tie'time&#xD;
we have chosen for the date of our story was&#xD;
composed of all iinds. of people ; not a small&#xD;
part of them being convicts shipped fromFrance&#xD;
to hasten the settlement of the country, and to.&#xD;
fre prisons already overflowing.&#xD;
e ° ie ville, the governor, was a bold and&#xD;
humane ,man, much esteeined by those&#xD;
his auth9rity.&#xD;
&#xD;
With this brief description of the Frenehaet4&#xD;
tlement on the banks of the Mississippi, in 172-i&#xD;
we shall proceed at once to the opening scenes&#xD;
of our story.&#xD;
It was a mild evening in the latter part of&#xD;
June. The sunlight had fallen from thle green&#xD;
leaves of -the forest, and lingered no longer on&#xD;
the summits of the western hills.&#xD;
At that calm and delightful hogr, the figur&amp;amp;of&#xD;
a man might have been seen standing thought-&#xD;
fully upon the margin of Lake PonchartrairiA&#xD;
beautiful sheet of water not far from thexie aw&#xD;
settlement. In person he was tall and eeed&#xD;
ingly muscular. Judging from his appearance&#xD;
he had not seen less than thirty summ'ers-in&#xD;
mers that had written lines of careupon 4i }&#xD;
brow, and whose suns had left a deep bruwn&#xD;
upon his face.&#xD;
He could not have been called eenmel o&#xD;
even good-looking,foiethere wass&#xD;

&#xD;
nature from the period of its earliest develop-&#xD;
meat; and the same might be said, with some&#xD;
show, of plausibility, in regard to his hair, which&#xD;
reached quite to his shoulders.&#xD;
The' individual's dress, to whom the reader's&#xD;
attention has been called, consisted of a hunting&#xD;
frock of dressed deer skin, breeches of the same,&#xD;
Indian moccasons, and a common foraging cap,&#xD;
probably manufactured by himself from the skins&#xD;
of the musk-rat, or the coon.&#xD;
A powder-horn ornamented with various de-&#xD;
vices, and a ball pouch, were suspended from&#xD;
his shoulders and hung at his side, where a hunt-&#xD;
ing-knifp of large size was also visible, thrust'&#xD;
beneath the leather thong which encircled his&#xD;
waist.&#xD;
In his right hand the hunter held a double-&#xD;
barrelled rifle, which few men of the present de-&#xD;
generate age would wish to carry; on account of&#xD;
its great weight.&#xD;
Suddenly the listless attitude of the hunter&#xD;
changed. He had heard the sound of footsteps&#xD;
in the forest near him.&#xD;
"Moran, I 'have been seeking you," said a&#xD;
voice; and the next moment a man of middling&#xD;
stature, wearing the, uniform of a French officer,&#xD;
stood beside the person we have here been de-&#xD;
F         scribing.&#xD;
'. What is your wish?" asked Moran, coldly.&#xD;
"Moran,"returned the other, playing careless-&#xD;
}ywith;the hilt of -his sword, " we-have met be-1&#xD;
fore on several occasions."&#xD;
"My memory is very good, Captain Lesage ;&#xD;
you might have spared yourself the trouble of&#xD;
making that remark," replied Moran, gruffly.&#xD;
-I am something of a physiognomist, my&#xD;
good friend," continued Lesage.  "I always&#xD;
nake a studX of the human face, in order to&#xD;
lea, something, of the character of its pos-&#xD;

and silent kind of way, you wo 'd be the man to&#xD;
do it, provided that your'services were compen.&#xD;
sated in a liberal manner; that is, in proportion&#xD;
to the risk incurred."&#xD;
For a moment a dqeper brown than usual&#xD;
was visible upon the forehead of Pierre Moran;&#xD;
but when Lesage looked up into his face for an&#xD;
answer, it had passed away.&#xD;
" You are very shrewd, captain," said the&#xD;
hunter, with a smile. " But go on; let me hear&#xD;
what you desire. Speak without reserve."&#xD;
"1I will do so," returned Lesage. " It is some-&#xD;
times the case, my worthy friend, that a person&#xD;
has an enemy; one whom he utterly despises."&#xD;
" That's very true, captain."&#xD;
"Well; can you not conceive that a man who&#xD;
has such an enemy might possibly wish to-"&#xD;
"Get him out of sight," added Moran.&#xD;
" You comprehend me, exactly. I see that I&#xD;
have not mistaken my man. To be plain with&#xD;
you, I have an enemy of this description, whom&#xD;
I wish to remove from my path. He is very&#xD;
dangerous ; he stands between me and my hopes&#xD;
and purposes. I have gold, Pierre Moran; you&#xD;
are a good shot I"&#xD;
Lesage paused and played nervously with&#xD;
his sword hilt.&#xD;
" I comprehend," answered the hunter, biting&#xD;
his lip.&#xD;
"Name your reward," added Lesage, in a&#xD;
voice less calm than that which he had at&#xD;
assumed.&#xD;
"You wear a sword, captain ; why not avenge&#xD;
your own wrongs, and save your gold ?" said&#xD;
Moran, looking contemptuously at Lesage.&#xD;
" I do not choose to. There are many reasons&#xD;
that make me anxious to entrust my vengeance&#xD;
to the hands of another; and you are the man I&#xD;
have selected."&#xD;
"You do me honor, Lesage,".replied the&#xD;
hunter, calmly.&#xD;
" The young man whose existence endangers&#xD;
my happiness, is in the habit of hunting about&#xD;
the borders of this lake."&#xD;
" His name, Lesage ?"&#xD;
"I will whisper it, lest these trees should have&#xD;
ears; it, is --"and the captain whispered the&#xD;
name as he had promised.&#xD;
"Did you hear?"&#xD;
"Perfectly well, captain; but how -am [ to&#xD;
know him ?"&#xD;
" That-will be the easiest thngin the:world.&#xD;
t1$llesiribo him. He is six tetvin height,&#xD;
ormved,.straight as an anowdithe as so In-&#xD;
&#xD;
dian, 4d the ladies call him handsome.. He is&#xD;
poor as beggarr, and proud as a prince. His&#xD;
complexion is dark, his eyes are black, his hair&#xD;
of the -same color, and it is barely possible that&#xD;
a little native blood circulates in his veins. He&#xD;
mingles freely with the Indians, and seems to&#xD;
have some influence among them."&#xD;
"You say he is fond of hunting ?"&#xD;
"It is his principal employment. He is quite&#xD;
as much at home in the woods as the aborigines&#xD;
themselves. He is an excellent shot, an4 carries&#xD;
a rifle, which may, for aught I know, be twin&#xD;
brother to your own. Do you think you should&#xD;
know him, Moran?"&#xD;
" Yes, captain."&#xD;
"Well; that man stands in my way," contin-&#xD;
ned Lesage, while his small gray eyes flashed&#xD;
with intense hatred. "When you will assure&#xD;
me-and bring proofs of what you affirm-that&#xD;
he is removed from my path, two hundred&#xD;
pounds will be subject to your order."&#xD;
" Liberal, upon my word!" exclaimed Moran,&#xD;
with another curl of that sinister nether lip.&#xD;
"Is there more to say on this subject?" asked&#xD;
Lesage, anxiously.&#xD;
"No more, captain."&#xD;
"Then we understand each other."&#xD;
"Perfectly." -&#xD;
" Two hundred pounds, Moran."&#xD;
"I comprehend."&#xD;
"It's settled, then ?"&#xD;
" Entirely."&#xD;
" You know where I am to be foui ?"&#xD;
"I do ; good night.",&#xD;
&#xD;
" Au revoir. I hope we shall meet again soon."&#xD;
And Lesage turned on his heel and walked&#xD;
away.&#xD;
" Senseless idiot 1" said the hunter to himself,&#xD;
when the form of Lesage had disappeared among&#xD;
the trees. "Aphysiognomist indeed ! Smooth-&#xD;
tongued dissembler ! for once you have reckon-&#xD;
ed without your host. When Pierre Moran im-&#xD;
brues his hands in the blood of his'fellow-man,&#xD;
save in self-defence, may he never live to wash&#xD;
out the foul stain, but pass to judgment fith all&#xD;
his sins upon his head. Go, Lesage, and find&#xD;
some other arm to slay one whom you dare not&#xD;
meet on equal terms. Pierre Moran can meet&#xD;
the red man two to one, and live through the&#xD;
fight ;'he can bring down the panther at two&#xD;
hundred yards, or he can battle successfully with&#xD;
the howling wolf-but a murder he cannot do;'&#xD;
and then he added in a lower tone, '"it was well&#xD;
for him that he found Pierre Moran in a calm&#xD;
and patient mood."&#xD;
With these words, the hunter shouldered his&#xD;
rifle and moved away along the margin of the&#xD;
lake. The moon had arisen, and her silvery&#xD;
rays were reflected softly upon the glassy waters.&#xD;
Tempted by the calm beauty of Ponchartrain,&#xD;
Pierre Moran paused occasionally in his solitary&#xD;
walk, to contemplate its sleeping depths.&#xD;
At length he turned from the lake and entered&#xD;
a dark dingle upon the right. Finding a spot&#xD;
suitable for the purpose, he gathered dry sticks&#xD;
and leaves, and by means Qf some powder and a&#xD;
flint set the heap on fire ; soon a bright blaze&#xD;
lighted up the dingle.&#xD;

French dogs."&#xD;
"Proud Indian, Pierre Moran is a French-&#xD;
said the hunter, sternly.&#xD;
" And a prisoner," 'added the chieftain, with a&#xD;
grim smile.&#xD;
"'Tis not true. I do not yield myself a pris-'&#xD;
oner. There, is not a single arm that can con-&#xD;
quer Pierre Moran, in a hand to hand encounter,&#xD;
to be found between the source of the great,&#xD;
river and its mouth."&#xD;
As the athletic hunter spoke, he drew his&#xD;
knife from its sheath, and struck his left foot&#xD;
fiercely upon the ground a little in advance of&#xD;
the right.&#xD;
" Haughty. savage, Pierre Moran is ready !&#xD;
Come on!"&#xD;
The Indian smiled scornfully.&#xD;
" I have only to shout the battle-cry of the&#xD;
Chickasaws, to bring an hundred warriors upon&#xD;
you," he said, slowly. "Pale face, put back&#xD;
your knife; to fight would be madness!"&#xD;
Moran replaced his knife in its sheath.&#xD;
"Whatdo you intend to do with me ?" he&#xD;
asked, fixing his dark eyes earnestly upon Ona-&#xD;
laska.&#xD;
"My warriors shall decide."&#xD;
"I thought I was talking with a great chief,"&#xD;
returned'Pierre, contemptuously.&#xD;
"And so you are; but a wise leader will al-&#xD;
ways please his warriors when he can," said the&#xD;
Indian.&#xD;
" Listen to me," replied the;hunter. "I will&#xD;
tell you hcw we may decide this matter. You&#xD;
are as strong and brave as any of your warriors.&#xD;
.Draw your hunting-knife and meet me on equal,&#xD;
terms, foot to foot, breast to breast, and hand to&#xD;
hand. He that is vanquished in the fight, let&#xD;
him be at the mercy of his victor. Let your&#xD;
braves remain where they are, and not put&#xD;
"forth their hands to decide the contest. Speak,&#xD;
Onalaska; is not the offer fair ?"&#xD;
" No, it is not," replied Onalaska. " I am a&#xD;
great war-chief-the leader of the alliednations,&#xD;
and you are without rank or title-a nameless&#xD;
hunter. My life belongs to my people, and why&#xD;
should I put it in peril, and thus endanger my&#xD;
great enterprise'?  The idea is foolish, and not&#xD;
to be thought of. Why should I risk so much&#xD;
when you are already in my power'? Pale face,&#xD;
when you fight Onalaska, it. must be in battle."&#xD;
" Listen once again, proud savage," continued&#xD;
Pierre Moran. " If jou will not meet me in the'&#xD;
manxner proposed, bring to me your mightiest&#xD;
&#xD;
warrior, and I #ill try my str&#xD;
with ,him in anyway he may&#xD;
conquer I will be free."&#xD;
For reply, the chief uttered&#xD;
war-cry, and instantly an hundred&#xD;
riors showed their grim 'faces ab.&#xD;
which the hunter had kindled.&#xD;
'T The white hunter is a captive ; wha.&#xD;
braves do with him'?" said Onalaska.&#xD;
There was a hurried consultation among&#xD;
warriors. At length a chief stepped for%,&#xD;
and said:&#xD;
"Let the pale face die according to the custom&#xD;
of the red man."&#xD;
"He has a brave heart," said Onalaska.&#xD;
"Then he will die like a man, and not like a&#xD;
squaw," replied the chief who had spoken.&#xD;
" He has never fought against our people&#xD;
continued Onalaska.&#xD;
"Let him perish then, before he slays an- of&#xD;

rejoined the chief.&#xD;
Onalaska said no more ; he folded. his atn#&#xD;

A tall savage stepped forward, waving a fiery&#xD;

" Spoken like a true man," said the hunter.&#xD;
May I be permitted to ask if yoi r home is&#xD;

" Sometimes it is near, at "others afar off"&#xD;
answered Delcroix, lightly. c At present, my&#xD;
home is wherever night overtakes me. I am a&#xD;
free denizen of the forest; a licensed wanderer&#xD;
among hills and'mountains."&#xD;
" A bold heart, truly. Pardon me if I ask&#xD;
your name ?"&#xD;
" I am called Henri Delcroix by the French;&#xD;
but the red man, not unfrequently, styles me the&#xD;
'WHITE ROVER.' I can tell you but little of&#xD;
my history. I' was born in the great valley of&#xD;
the Mississippi about the time of the first settle-&#xD;
meint at Biloxi. My early youth was passed&#xD;
mostly among the Indians, but I was' finally&#xD;
domiciled in the house of a good priest, who&#xD;
taught me to read and write. I renlember a&#xD;
French woman, also, who seemed very fond of&#xD;
me, and taught me much that was useful. The&#xD;
priest is still living. Lie has recently taken up&#xD;
his residence at the new settlement, which they&#xD;
call New Orleans, and I am allowed to follow&#xD;
my own inclinations. This is about all yam at&#xD;
liberty to tell you of my own history."&#xD;
"In return for your frankness," replied the&#xD;
other, "I will inform you'that'my name is Pierre&#xD;
Moran. Like 'you, my home is in the woods,&#xD;
for I am a hunter. I am familiar with every&#xD;
acre of the country an hundred miles up the&#xD;
river. I know where the deer goes down to&#xD;
drink; where the fox seeks covert; where the&#xD;
Wolf prowls at night ; and where the panther&#xD;
loves best to lie in wait fir its prey. I know&#xD;
something of the Indian tribs, also, and of the&#xD;
habits of that strange people. When you de-&#xD;
sire the aid of a strong hand, and a huntes ~&#xD;
friendship, give the preference to Pierre Moran.&#xD;
The'service you have rendered me this night,&#xD;
makes me your friend forever."&#xD;
"I thank you for your manly proffers of friend-&#xD;
ship; for in these troublous times, true friend-&#xD;
ships are rare," returned Deleroix, warmly.&#xD;
"And real enemies too often found," rejoined&#xD;
Pierre.&#xD;
"Yes; and how much it is to be regretted,"&#xD;
said Delcroix, sadly.&#xD;
" And now, while I think of it, permit me to&#xD;
whisper these words of warning in your ear:&#xD;

"1I am not; and it is possible that the time is&#xD;

acquired coosiderable influence over the minds&#xD;
of our -ed neighbors. No Imger ago than last&#xD;
night, I dared to dash into their midst, and&#xD;
snatch a victim from the jaws of death,'even af-&#xD;
ter the :fires were lighted., And," continued&#xD;
Henri, with a flashing eye and a heaving chest,&#xD;
" I escaped unharmed. Not oneof the horribly&#xD;
painted warriors pointed a feathered arrow,-or&#xD;
raised"a' tomahawk against me. There is not&#xD;
another man in Louisiana that could have done&#xD;
it."                              -&#xD;
"I'll answer for the truth of that assertion&#xD;
with my ,life," said a voice.&#xD;
Henri and Helen turned toward the door, and&#xD;
their eyes rested upon the figure of Pierre&#xD;
Moran.&#xD;
" There is not another man in the French&#xD;
colony that could have done it and lived to tell&#xD;
his sweetheart of it. Pierre Moran says it," ad-&#xD;
ded the hunter.&#xD;
"And he would be a bold man who would&#xD;
dare gainsay you," replied Henri. "Permit me&#xD;
to introduce you to Mademoiselle Lerowe."&#xD;
Pierre bowed gallantly, and expressed the&#xD;
pleasure he experienced in making the acquaint-&#xD;
ance of so fair a lady.    '&#xD;
" As you stayed much longer than you had&#xD;
anticipated,", said Moran, turning to Henri, " I&#xD;
feared something unfortunate had befallen you,&#xD;
and camepromptly to the rescue ; but I perceive&#xD;
that you can dispense with my services."&#xD;
Henri and Helen exchanged glances, and&#xD;
changed color.&#xD;
At that crisis Madame Ridelle and her inter-&#xD;
esting daughter appeared, and Pierre Moran was&#xD;
greeted as an old acquaintance.  .&#xD;
" I have hunted many a day, and camped&#xD;
many a night with Ridelle,"- said the hunter.&#xD;
"And I have fought he savages side by side,&#xD;
with him, and hope to again, for there will soon&#xD;
be warm work in the colony."&#xD;
"Do you think so ?" asked Madame Ridelle,&#xD;
anxiously.&#xD;
" There can be no doubt of it, madame., It's&#xD;
a fact that might as well be known first as last.&#xD;
The red men are aroused to vengeance, and&#xD;
much blood will be shed."&#xD;
Madame Ridelle sighed. Monsieur Moran&#xD;
looked furtively at Adelaide, and Adelaidelook-&#xD;

&#xD;
the danger that threatens this devoted colony.&#xD;
Already I seem to hear the shrieks of helpless&#xD;
women, and the wailings of innocent babes.&#xD;
Good heavens ! that such depravity should be&#xD;
found on earth !" and the tender-hearted captain&#xD;
covered his face with his hands, and paced the&#xD;
floor in deep affliction.&#xD;
"Be calm, Captain Lesage," said the governor,&#xD;
somewhat softened by his emotions. " Restrain&#xD;
your anxiety; immediate steps shall be taken&#xD;
to arrest the threatened calamity."&#xD;
De Bienville paused, and seemed absorbed in&#xD;
thought.&#xD;
"And this boy was the friend and playmate of&#xD;
Helen," he said, musingly-" the bright and in-&#xD;
telligent youth I used so much to admire.&#xD;
Strange that the human countenance should be&#xD;
such a falsehood,. and furnish no key to the&#xD;
character of its possessor."&#xD;
Then turning suddenly to Lesage :&#xD;
"Do you think Father Davion knows aught&#xD;
of Henri's plans, or really understands his dis-&#xD;
position ?"&#xD;
I do not. The good old man has not the&#xD;
remotest idea of the baseness of the serpent he&#xD;
has nurtured in his bosom. When the whole is&#xD;
made known to him, it will bring his gray hairs&#xD;
m sorrow to thegrave."&#xD;
And some of our heads, it would seem, wil&#xD;
be brought down to sheol before our hairs have a&#xD;
 thance to grow gray. Alas, we are an unfortu&#xD;
nate people. Lesage, I wigh there were some&#xD;
mistake about this matter. I do not wish to&#xD;
think so hardly of the boy ; and do Bienville&#xD;
walked the room with agitated and uneven steps&#xD;
" Go and arrest him," he said, at length, in s&#xD;
sorrowful voice. " Go and arrest him," and h&#xD;
waved his hand for Lesage to depart.&#xD;
"I never gave an order with so much reluc&#xD;
tance," he said to himself, when the captain ha&#xD;
gone. "I really liked the lad; but what a veno&#xD;
mo-s viper ho is, to be sure. And.so young&#xD;
too. Mon Die! I am losing all faith in humax&#xD;
nature."&#xD;
We-will now, gentle reader, bend our foot&#xD;
stops _to-,the humble- cabin of Father Davion-&#xD;
one whose name is already recorded upon th&#xD;
page of history, as the friend and instructor o&#xD;
the poor and untutored savage.&#xD;
'The venerable old man was alone. He wa&#xD;
engaged in the most ennobling of all huma&#xD;
ployseentspraerm  t  hr opefear,"u&#xD;
for- himself._&#xD;
I'reerve s rom A1..t+.horors ofwar," It&#xD;
&#xD;
cried, elevating his hands and bowing his head&#xD;
low-upon his breast. " Save my people from&#xD;
blood-guiltiness. Disarm the poor red man of&#xD;
his vengeance; protect this feeble colony, lest it&#xD;
perish from the face of the earth."&#xD;
Father Davion arose from his knees. The&#xD;
door opened and Henri Delcroix entered.&#xD;
"Pax vobiscupa " (peace be with you), said the&#xD;
man of God.&#xD;
"Under your roof," replied Henri, feelingly,&#xD;
" I have ever found the blessing which you have&#xD;
now invoked.&#xD;
" Deo gratias (thanks be to God). It makes&#xD;
my heart glad to hear you say so, my son. But&#xD;
what are these rumors that are afloat in New Or-&#xD;
leans ? Sit down and tell me. Is there really any&#xD;
danger of a simultaneous rising of the Indians ?"&#xD;
" There is, good father. The peril is immi-&#xD;
nent, and if some decisive measures are not im-&#xD;
mediately taken by the governor to soften down&#xD;
the spirit of vengeance, or to meet it face to face,&#xD;
the French settlements will be swept away with&#xD;
the besom of destruction."&#xD;
The holy father crossed himself most devoutly.&#xD;
Deus in adjutorium meum intended ! You must&#xD;
- hasten to the governor at once, and give him&#xD;
due warning."&#xD;
" Alas, his ears are not open to counsel like&#xD;
l mine," answered Henri, sadly. "Other tongues&#xD;
are busy with him, and my bare assertion would&#xD;
- avail but little."&#xD;
" Do you mean to say, my son, that the gov-&#xD;
ernor's mind is already closed against you?"&#xD;
"I have good and sufficient reasons for be-&#xD;
lieving so ; for he has dangerous counsellors.&#xD;
a Lesage, forgetful of all but self, is constantly&#xD;
e pouring his subtle poisonsinto the governor's&#xD;
mind, and soon there will be no room there for&#xD;
- aught save distrust and anxiety. One Pierre&#xD;
d Moran, a hunter, whose name you have doubtless&#xD;
- heard, has been with de Bienville to-day, and he&#xD;
heard enough to 'convince him that I'should&#xD;
a have little or no influence with him, although I&#xD;
am known to have an accurate knowledge of the&#xD;
Indians and Indian character."&#xD;
" Ah, Henri! de Bienville prides himself on&#xD;
e his own knowledge of Indian character," said&#xD;
)f .Father Davion.&#xD;
" And not without reason. He is wise and&#xD;
s sagacious in that respect, and is much esteem&#xD;
n by the red;man ; but he -is not admitted into&#xD;
)t; their confidence, es I have been."&#xD;
"Very true, my son; you are indeediu afar-&#xD;
e ~fnl dilenuna. You cannot ight again as u&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WHIZ&#xD;
people, and how can you betray the trust of the&#xD;
poor Indian-lift your hand against him who&#xD;
has fed and warmed you !" exclaimed Father&#xD;
Davion, with much emotion.&#xD;
" Your words fill me with apprehension; holy&#xD;
father. I am indeed painfully embarrassed. My&#xD;
thoughts distract he! But Mon Dieu! I can-&#xD;
not stand still and see the savage curs shedcthe&#xD;
blood of these helpless colonists ! No no ! I&#xD;
will fly to the forests ; I will present myself be-&#xD;
fore the red men. I will tell them I shake off&#xD;
their friendship forever; that henceforth there is&#xD;
no bond of sympathy between us;that I will&#xD;
meet them in the field, and in the forest, as&#xD;
deadly enemies ; that I cannot turn renegade to&#xD;
my own blood. Give me my rifle, my powder-&#xD;
horn, my ball-pouch, my hunting-knife, and let&#xD;
me away !"&#xD;
"No, stay, my dear boy. Let us think calmly ;&#xD;
let us plan deliberately ; let us look the danger&#xD;
calmly in the face."a&#xD;
" And while we are doing that, the war-cry&#xD;
may perchance be heard all along the banks of &#xD;
"But reflect, my son ; you must not throw I&#xD;
away your life when your aid is so mich needed&#xD;
by these defenceless people. Women and chil-a&#xD;
dren claim the protection of every hand that can I&#xD;
lift a musket or wield a sword."&#xD;
"And there is one, good Father Davion, that&#xD;
Henri Delcroix would die to save," said the&#xD;
young man, in a low, impressive voice.    a&#xD;
"What !" exclaimed Father Davion.  "Is&#xD;
your heart then enthralled by the blandishments v&#xD;
of woman ?"&#xD;
" It is ; and her name is Helen Lerowe, the p&#xD;
fairest of the fair, and for her sake I would face&#xD;
a thousand deaths, and my heart should not pul- h&#xD;
sate with a single fear for myself."&#xD;
" Now may Heaven be merciful, Henri, for ti&#xD;
there is indeed danger before you !"&#xD;
" D o  you  reproach  m e, father, for  loving  that'  ,  l  il - n  h m y u y u sl  a g te I)&#xD;
noble girlone werhom you yourself taught mt t&#xD;
to love as a sister, when you taught us to read 'c(&#xD;
from the same bookI"&#xD;
No, no! I do not reproach you. Were it&#xD;
riot, foir the -ruin which you will draw down upon ,of&#xD;
your own young head, I would rather you should'&#xD;
fix your love upon 'Helen Lerowe, than any other ar&#xD;
woman in the world. But do you not-see'that&#xD;
your relations to her are 'changed? She is no&#xD;

lovers. She can choose from the titled and the&#xD;
wealthy; and be assured de- Bienville will ixer=&#xD;
cisc a parent's authority over her actions;.at&#xD;
least, so far as it seems to him for her good."&#xD;
" Allyou have said is true; but do not imag-&#xD;
iae that it has not occurred to me4 before. I&#xD;
have thought of it for many months ; but to-day&#xD;
I have done more than simply to think=-I have&#xD;
acted. Helen loves me, and our mutual vows&#xD;
are registered in heaven."&#xD;
"Rash boy ! you are rushing headlong to your&#xD;
ruin. You have rich and powerful rivals,who&#xD;
will crush you at a blow. How can a friendless{&#xD;
nameless, homeless youth enter the arena and&#xD;
do battle with such odds !" cried Father Dialon,&#xD;
in tones of real anguish.&#xD;
"Is it generous, holy father, to refer to my&#xD;
obscure birth ? Has not the ragged iron already&#xD;
entered my soul? Need I another thrust t6&#xD;
keep me umble? Would you strike the sub-&#xD;
missivedog that already crouches at your feet '&#xD;
"Hold, my dear Henri! you are' too hard&#xD;
upon your old friend. If I probe your woundi&#xD;
it is that I may heal it soundly and well 'ar&#xD;
e it from me to reproach you because your&#xD;
arentage is obscure. The same inscrutable&#xD;
obscurity also hangs over the parentage of&#xD;
Helen ; and. it were folly to affirm that she is&#xD;
ess lovely or noble for that."&#xD;
"I hear footsteps without," said Henri,1stairt-&#xD;
ng to his feet' "It sounds like the tread 'df&#xD;
"m   me. What can it mean ?"&#xD;
"You may well ask !" exclaimed Fa'het a&#xD;
ion, "for I see the bristling of bayonets through&#xD;
he windows ! Alas ! my heart tells ie but too&#xD;
mainly what it portends."&#xD;
There was a loud rap like a blow from' the&#xD;
ilt of a sword.&#xD;
" Conceal yourself, my dear boy," whispered&#xD;
he holy father.&#xD;
" Never," said Henri,  firmly. "I will .'ee&#xD;
he danger boldly, whatever it may be. Heari&#xD;
)elcroix will never fly while 'hef has' the prou-4'&#xD;
consciousness that he has, done nothing wadt&#xD;

Father Davion opened the door, and theobhig&#xD;
fTesage darkened the threshold.&#xD;
"Henri Deleroix,[ arit you," he'saidin an&#xD;

" By whose authority 1" asked Hlenri, cli&#xD;

Lesage bit his lips and made no reply.&#xD;

the captain, facetiously.1&#xD;

the governor's residence, and thither Henri was,&#xD;

of hearing the locks of a prison turn upon-him&#xD;

Immediately after the prison doors had been&#xD;
ocked upon Henri, Captain Lesage hastened to&#xD;
he presence of De Bienville, who had not yet&#xD;
etired, but was pacing his room with a mind&#xD;
istracted by the most intense anxiety.&#xD;
" Well, captain, what news 1"'he asked, earn-&#xD;
stly, when Lesage appeared.&#xD;
" May it please your excellency, our worst-&#xD;
ears are confirmed," he said, with a low bow,&#xD;
nd a lugubrious voice. " Upon searching the&#xD;
oung man, I found upon his person sundry&#xD;
ieces of birch bark, which seem to be covered&#xD;
with diagrams, one of which I will lay before&#xD;
rou and attempt to explain."&#xD;
Lesage proceeded to unroll a piece of birch&#xD;
bark about the size of a letter sheet.&#xD;
" This serpentine mark through the centre of&#xD;
he bark, represents, doubtless,- the Mississippi&#xD;
winding its way along the great valley, and&#xD;
hese two smaller ones the Tombigbee and Per-&#xD;
dido. These round characters indicate the dif-&#xD;
ferent French settlements. This is Natchitoches ;&#xD;
his is New Orleans; this is Dauphine'Island,&#xD;
and this is Pensacola."&#xD;
" Sacre Dieu I" exclaimed the governor, lifting&#xD;
his hands in astonishment.&#xD;
" Observe, your excellen y, that these large&#xD;
marks represent the Natchez; this the Choc-&#xD;
taws ; this the Chickasaws ; this the Mobilians,&#xD;
and this the Yazoos."&#xD;
" The saints defend us I" ejaculated the gov-&#xD;
ernor.&#xD;
"These arrows, your excellency," continued&#xD;
Lesage, with consummate ;art, "indicate the&#xD;
number Of villages in each nation ; while these&#xD;
belts of wampum represent the number of chiefs.&#xD;
Near each village you perceive a hatchet and a&#xD;
scalping-knife,; showing probably that a state of&#xD;
warfare exists, and is to be carried forward with&#xD;
vigor,"    -&#xD;
" Are you morally certain that this is the work&#xD;
of that unhappy young man ?" said De Bien-&#xD;
ville, with a lowering brow.&#xD;
"What farther assurance does your excellency&#xD;
require ?" asked Lesage, with a troubled ex-&#xD;
pression.&#xD;
" All that I can possibly have. It never shall&#xD;
be said that De Bienville, during his adminis-&#xD;
tration,.acted: hastily or, without ,due evidence&#xD;
that he was in thepath of duty. What are you&#xD;
trying to decipher at the bottom of the chart 2i"&#xD;
"See for yourself," replied Lesage.&#xD;
The governor took the{birchen chart and rea4&#xD;
in legible characters the name of  eupri 1&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WHIT&#xD;
&#xD;
croix, and just beneath it the name of Onalaska&#xD;
sometimess styled Red Shoe), the famous Indian&#xD;
warrior and diplomatist.&#xD;
De Bienville's hand shook while he held in it&#xD;
the fatal sign of:Henri's guilt.&#xD;
" The whole of the foul plot has not yet been&#xD;
developed," added Lesage, in a tone of well&#xD;
dissembled grief. " This hard-hearted, incon-&#xD;
siderate. and remorseless youth has also tam-&#xD;
ppred with the Banbara negroes, and they are&#xD;
ripe for revolt."&#xD;
The governor, upon hearing this astonishing&#xD;
intelligence, was for a moment speechless with&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
".I have heard," he said, at length, endeavor-&#xD;
ing to speak with calmness, "vague rumors of&#xD;
an insurrection among the Banbaras, but I have&#xD;
hitherto regarded them but lightly, knowing&#xD;
that the negroes are, as a general thing, a docile&#xD;
and peaceably disposed race of men, suffering&#xD;
wrong often, but very seldom resisting oppres-&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
"Bat now the aspect of things is indeed seri-&#xD;
ous, for there are as many negroes as whites&#xD;
in Louisiana at the present moment. Before we&#xD;
proceed farther, tell me how you gained this&#xD;
most astonishing piece of news ?"&#xD;
"From my own faithful knave, your excel-&#xD;
lency."&#xD;
"Call him in, Lesage."&#xD;
In a short time the captain's colored servant&#xD;
made his appearance.&#xD;
"Curlie, cover up your teeth with those thick&#xD;
lips, and answer any questions his excellency&#xD;
may ask, and see that you keep nothing back,"&#xD;
said the captain.&#xD;
"Yes, massa," replied Curlie, displaying a&#xD;
large quantity of ivory.&#xD;
Curlie," said the governor, sternly, "can you&#xD;
tell the truth ?"&#xD;
I used to eould, massa," replied Curlie.&#xD;
Do you know Henri Deleroix ?"&#xD;
As I know my farder, massa gubernor."&#xD;
"Has he ever tampered with you ?"&#xD;
" He tried to, but he couldn't 'kase Ise so wir-&#xD;
tuous-.&#xD;
'The governor could not repress a smile.&#xD;
"Did he ever ask you to join the Indians in&#xD;
waging a war of extermination against the&#xD;
French?"&#xD;
" Them's the werry words he said to me,&#xD;
Gubernor Bienville. He told me we could soon&#xD;
make the French run away; that is, what few of&#xD;
&#xD;
E. ROVER.&#xD;
'em wasn't scalped, and then we could make*&#xD;
nice--what do you call 'em-republic Qf Ot&#xD;
own, and some of e Banbaras would be gube.&#xD;
nors in course of time. Butit:wan's my nature&#xD;
to commit such anact of moral turpentineI"&#xD;
"Tupitude, you mean," said Lesage.&#xD;
"Do you know whether he ever talked in a&#xD;
similar manner to other colored persons," con-&#xD;
tinued the governor.&#xD;
" le did. There's quite a 'telligent dark&#xD;
that I'm jest been conversing. with,, that he&#xD;
talked to in the same disrespectable way,"&#xD;
"You may go, Curlie, and if you see that it&#xD;
telligent colored gentleman, request him tq come&#xD;
in," added the governor, with great gravity.&#xD;
The negro referred to made his appearance&#xD;
almost immediately, and testified ,much in the&#xD;
same manner that his predecessor had done.&#xD;
"Captain Lesage," said de Bienville, whey&#xD;
they were alone, "I am satisfied .that this-is a&#xD;
most serious affair, and that all the French set-&#xD;
tlements are in danger of complete destruction.&#xD;
Your important services shall not be forgotten.&#xD;
You may regard your promotion as something&#xD;
fixed upon and certain. Any favors I can rea-&#xD;
sonably grant, you may ask without fear of re-&#xD;
buke. The events of the last few days have&#xD;
secured you a warm friend in the person of the&#xD;
governor of Louisiana-an office which the uni-&#xD;
ted voices of the colonists affirm he has never&#xD;
yet disgraced."&#xD;

him off by some means, in order' to spare him&#xD;
the anguish of a direct refusal of his wishe~&#xD;

alliance.&#xD;
There had also heen much "discontent among&#xD;
the Banbara negroes, and Henri was now as&#xD;
deeply implicated in the embryo insmrection as&#xD;
in the Indian league ; and it was fearfully appa-&#xD;

destruction.&#xD;
It was known that our hero had been much&#xD;
with the Indians, and had considerable influence&#xD;
over them; and, this fact, added to the many&#xD;
which Lesage had produced, afforded, in the&#xD;
estimation of the governor, but too evident proof&#xD;

CHAPTER 'V.&#xD;
LA GLORIEUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
UPON the night of Henri's arrest, a birchen&#xD;
canoe containing two persons was floating noise-&#xD;
lessly down the Mississippi, near its western&#xD;
bank. Both the voyagers were females. The&#xD;
one who occupied the stern of the frail vessel&#xD;
was a Natchez woman of about twenty years of&#xD;
age, uncommonly handsome, and nearly related&#xD;
to the Great Sun. She was in fact a princess.&#xD;
Her name was La Glorieuse-The Proud.&#xD;
As the soft moonlight fell upon the face of La&#xD;
Gloricuse, it revealed features which would not&#xD;
have proved uninteresting even to the most&#xD;
common-place observer. The light of a lofty&#xD;
spirit beamed from her eyes. Firmness and&#xD;
gentleness seemed to have met in the expression-&#xD;
of the mouth, and the general formation of the-&#xD;
face.&#xD;
Her hair was very, long and glossy, and hung&#xD;
loosely, but yet gracefully over her shoulders,&#xD;
giving her rather a coquettish appearance.&#xD;
She was dressed evidently with great care ac-&#xD;
cording to the Indian taste, and yet on the whole&#xD;
having an air of easy negligence quite agreeable&#xD;
to the beholder.&#xD;
La Glorieuse held a light and fancifully carved&#xD;
paddle, which she Occasionally dipped into- the&#xD;
wave with a quick and dexterous movement&#xD;
The; birchen vessel, obedient to the impulse,&#xD;
glided on with a steady and untiring motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
The female who sat in the bow of the canoe,&#xD;
was obviously descended from a different race.&#xD;
She was a Frenchwoman of about thirty yearsof&#xD;
age, as nearly as one could judge from her ap-&#xD;
pearance. Her name was' Leona Mablois; but'&#xD;
she usually passed as Madame Mablois among&#xD;
the French,.while the Indians had bestowedupon&#xD;
her the more romantic appellation of Chatakawa1&#xD;
which means Soft-Voice,' or the woman that&#xD;
sings; which was given her on account of the&#xD;
peculiar sweetness of her voice.&#xD;
Though the blushing beauty of youth had&#xD;
faded from the face of Madame Mablois, it I4d&#xD;
not left it without attractions. A certain degte6&#xD;
of calm repose had fixed itself upon her featttiea;1&#xD;
yet they were impressed and somewhat saddened'&#xD;
by visible lines of care and constant'thougft.&#xD;
Her features and manners were still pleasing,&#xD;
and calculated to inspire confidence and friend-&#xD;
ship. Though her face was somewhat darkened&#xD;
by exposure to the open air, it had lost little off&#xD;
its true delicacy, and still retained vestiges of its'&#xD;
pristine loveliness. Her figure was: good, ,a nd&#xD;
possessed that embonpoint so highly esteemedby&#xD;
connoisseurs in beauty as developed in the genes&#xD;
tier sex. Her dress was in keeping with her&#xD;
habits, being a graceful blending of the French&#xD;
and Indian styles.&#xD;

TUE WHI&#xD;
Madame Mablois. "I can see the smoke of New&#xD;
Orlean&amp;amp;"&#xD;
K what will my white sister do when she gets&#xD;
gerev' asked La Glorieuse, looking earnestly at&#xD;
Leona.&#xD;
"I shall seek an interview with Father Davion,"&#xD;
replied the Frenchwoman.&#xD;
a And will my gentle sister tell him all?" con-&#xD;
ttnued La Glorieuse.&#xD;
Madame Mablois covered her face with her&#xD;
hands and sighed.&#xD;
"My red sister is curious," she said, at length,&#xD;
with a forced smile.&#xD;
"It is because her heart has been touched by&#xD;
the sorrows of the Soft-Voice,' rejoined La Glo-&#xD;
riense.&#xD;
"I will keep nothing from you," replied Leona,&#xD;
after a short interval of silence. " I shall be gov-&#xD;
erned by circumstances in regard to what I may&#xD;
reveal to. Father Davion. - If the proper time&#xD;
seems to have arrived, I shall conceal nothing.&#xD;
I have the papers with me, and if anythirtg should&#xD;
befai'me, promise me, my faithful friend, 'that&#xD;
Xeu will secure and keep them as. a sacred de-&#xD;
posit, carrying out my plans so far as you know&#xD;

cpaeern the happiness of two persons; yes, I&#xD;
slight with propriety say three or four.e I feel&#xD;
that Imust see Henri. I have much to say to&#xD;
«im. If circumstances have assumed a certain&#xD;
aspect, :I shall consider myself so far released&#xD;
fiat my promise as to make disclosures of the&#xD;
latest importance,; but if on the contrary,&#xD;
thinga have taken a different'course, my promise&#xD;
will still be valid, and must be adhered to, how-&#xD;
ever much I may feel disposed to murmur at the&#xD;
decrses offate.".,&#xD;
She Frenchwoman may trust to the friend-&#xD;
sMpiof La Glorieuse," said the princess. "She&#xD;
qil1 never desert her friend while the Master of&#xD;
Life,gives her strength and breath."&#xD;
.:'ThaRk you; you are well worthy of the royal&#xD;
bland:which raises you above the common rank,'&#xD;
repl;idMablois.&#xD;
" Ah," said'La Glorieuse, with a smile, "royal&#xD;
bJood is little esteemed by the French people&#xD;
whewtit circulates in the veins of the Indian."&#xD;
61WWll, let it pass; you are just as much a&#xD;
gihtesa as though your blood was white as my&#xD;
*awrp'Many a princess has ascended a throne o&#xD;
regaldnagnificence,,and governed a people pro&#xD;
fssedly Christian, with a heart far less noble thai&#xD;
yoza" added Madame Mablois.&#xD;
[ Th&amp;amp; face of La Glorieuse lighted up wit]&#xD;
&#xD;
"The Soft-Voice flatters her simple red friend,"&#xD;
she said, with a blush. " But here we are among&#xD;
your people."&#xD;
As the Indian maiden spoke, the canoe touched&#xD;
the Levee at New Orleans-that important thing&#xD;
known at the present day as the Levee had not&#xD;
then attained a height and extent worthy of the&#xD;
name, though the earth had been raised to pre-&#xD;
vent the river from inundating its banks, and&#xD;
sweeping away all their efforts at making an in-&#xD;
habitable place, but we shall occasionally take the&#xD;
liberty to call that then imperfect embankment by&#xD;
the name by which it is now known.&#xD;
Mablois stepped from the tiny vessel ; La Glo-&#xD;
rieuse followed her, and together they drew it to&#xD;
a place of security ; this effected, they walked&#xD;
silently towards the residence of Father Davion.&#xD;
Passing what is now called the Public Square,&#xD;
they reached the corner of Conde and Ursuline&#xD;
streets, where the dwelling of Davion was in&#xD;
sight.&#xD;
Both parties paused, for it was evident that&#xD;
something unusual was going forward. They&#xD;
saw more than a score of armed men surround&#xD;
the place silently, and then remain motionless,&#xD;
waiting farther orders.&#xD;
" A French officer knocks at the door with his&#xD;
sword," said La Glorieuse.' " He enters ; and:&#xD;
now another'officer with several- soldiers follows&#xD;
him. Let us go a little - nearer. There goes&#xD;
another man with chains for the wrists."&#xD;
" Handcuffs, those are," said Mablois, in an&#xD;
agitated voice.&#xD;
" Do you hear that voice ?" added La Glori-&#xD;
euse.&#xD;
"I hear a voice, certainly," replied Mablois.&#xD;
"And does.not my pale sister recognize it !*&#xD;
she asked, earnestly.&#xD;
" It is Lesage !" almost shrieked Mablois.&#xD;
" Some great evil menaces Henri. Let me fly to,&#xD;
his assistance !"&#xD;
"Hush !" said La Glorieuse, throwing her arms&#xD;
about Mablois, and forcibly detaining her. " You&#xD;
can do nothing. Woman cannot'save her friends&#xD;
I by the strength of her hands, but by cunning&#xD;
plans. Let us watch'- these movements, white&#xD;
sister, and we shall know what to do."&#xD;
"Iight, my friend, right. The feeble strength'&#xD;
of woman cannot avail against armed men.&#xD;
f What do you see now ?"&#xD;
" I see a tall' young man led forth from the&#xD;
n cabin, and-he has those chains I spoke of upon,&#xD;
his hands. It is Henri. The white warriors take&#xD;
h their places in order; and the war chief with the&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WHITE ROVER.&#xD;
&#xD;
long knife commands them to march. They&#xD;
move away. We will follow them."&#xD;
" They are going towards the prison," added&#xD;
Mablois.&#xD;
Leona and La Glorieuse quickened their pace&#xD;
and kept near the parties until they reached the&#xD;
prison. They saw Henri enter, ard the bolts&#xD;
drawn upon him, and the soldiers return to the&#xD;
barracks, leaving a sentinel posted near the door&#xD;
for greater security.&#xD;
Lesage went to the governor's mansion, and&#xD;
his steps were still silently followed by Madame&#xD;
Mablois and her friend.&#xD;
"Now is the time," said La Glorieuse, " to find&#xD;
out what the danger is that threatens Henri ;"&#xD;
and taking the arm of her less composed com-&#xD;
panion, she drew her to the reai of the governor's&#xD;
house.&#xD;
"You see a light there, Soft-Voice ?"&#xD;
"I do."-&#xD;
" The governor is in that room, and the wily&#xD;
serpent is with him. Here is a tree near the&#xD;
high fence, and another near the window. First&#xD;
we will climb into this, and let ourselves down&#xD;
into the yard by the branches ; then we will climb&#xD;
softly into that, and listen to the words of the&#xD;
great father and chef menteur (lying chief)."&#xD;
This proposal was immediately put into exe-&#xD;
cution-for the indulgent reader will bear in mind&#xD;
that the females of that day could accomplish any&#xD;
feat requiring dexterity and strength, with about&#xD;
the same facility as the other sex.&#xD;
The tree was low, and its ascent easy. La&#xD;
Glorieuse, more practised in the art of forest life,&#xD;
and more agile than her companion, was the first&#xD;
to let herself down into the yard (which would&#xD;
doubtless be called a court at the present time).&#xD;
She assisted Mablois to alight safely upon the&#xD;
ground. Their next care was to attain a suitable&#xD;
position among the branches of the willow grow-&#xD;
ing by the window. This they succeeded in do-&#xD;
ing with much more silence and despatch than&#xD;
might have been anticipated. The tree proved&#xD;
post favorable to their purpose, for with their&#xD;
ears placed close to the window, they were ena-&#xD;
bled to hear the whole of the conversation be-&#xD;
tween De Bienville and Lesage, as we have given&#xD;
it in another place.&#xD;
Having made themselves acquainted with the&#xD;
whole plan of the captain's villany, they descend-&#xD;
ed from the place of their concealment, and after&#xD;
considerable exertion scaled the high fence and&#xD;
left the vicinity.&#xD;
"Do you not see, sister, that cunning is better&#xD;
than strength ?" asked La Glorieuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Perhaps what we have done would not be&#xD;
called pardonable by many people," replied&#xD;
Mablois.&#xD;
"It is a mean act to listen to the talk of others&#xD;
merely to gratify curiosity; but to expose a lying&#xD;
chief and save a brave friend, it is right,' an-&#xD;
swered the princess.&#xD;
" Yes, I feel that it must be so. In this case&#xD;
the end to be obtained must justify the means we&#xD;
have been forced to employ to bring about' its&#xD;
consummation. Now tell me frankly, La Glorii&#xD;
euse, do you think we can do anything to save&#xD;
Henri from death? for, unless the truth can" be&#xD;
proved beyond a doubt, I am well assured that&#xD;
De Bienville will not spare him; although it is&#xD;
evident that he feels a strong interest in the&#xD;
'unhappy youth,' as he is pleased to call him."&#xD;
Mablois spoke in a voice that bore witness-to&#xD;
the intense anxiety which she felt for Henri.&#xD;
" Chef menteur (he was already known among&#xD;
the Natchez as the lying chief) is a bad man.&#xD;
His plans are deep and deadly ; for you know it.&#xD;
is true that there has been a great war-couneit&#xD;
among the war-chiefs of the different, nations..&#xD;
and it has been resolved to kill all the French..&#xD;
It is true, also, that many of the negroes are-&#xD;
willing to fight against their masters, and some&#xD;
of them have already run away and found home'&#xD;
among us.&#xD;
" Now all this is against the brave young pal&#xD;
face. The great father is already of the opinior&#xD;
that all this trouble has originated with him; for&#xD;
you see that chef menteur has proved it by th&#xD;
speakingy bark, and the two negroes, besides man&#xD;
other things which he has made use of to blin&#xD;
the eyes of the great father, so that he cann&#xD;
see clearly."&#xD;
"Yes, I understand, La Glorieuse."&#xD;
. " Wh'n the great chief of the French resolve&#xD;
to do a thing, and thinks it is right, he loses ni&#xD;
time by unnecessary delay. If a man is to die,&#xD;
he does not put it off; he says in a terrible voice,&#xD;
' Lead him out and put him to death.' NobQdy&#xD;
has courage to say, 'you had better wait little.&#xD;
for the great chief would be very angry, and&#xD;
lightning would flash from his eyes."&#xD;
"I know it! I know it !" exclaimed Mablos.&#xD;
"lHe acts with terrible decision when he believes&#xD;
justice requires the punishment of an offender:&#xD;
" You see, then, that if we were to. go to him&#xD;
and say, ' Great father, chef menteur has lied to&#xD;
you,' he would frown upon us, and say, ' Iknow&#xD;
my duty. I do not ask Ltounsel 9f women.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Upon reflectionmy better judgment tells in&#xD;
that you are.right. Do yot not think that Helen&#xD;
Lerowe might aid us in effecting his escape from&#xD;
prison ?"&#xD;
La Glorieuse shook her head thoughtfully.&#xD;
" The white maiden can do' but little at pres-&#xD;
ent, because she will be closely watched by chef&#xD;
menteur," said the princess.  "Pierre Moran&#xD;
would do better."&#xD;
" What can he do, La Glorieuse ?"&#xD;
" Climb up to the prison window and remove&#xD;
the iron bars, so that the young man may&#xD;
escape.&#xD;
"Let us seek him at once !" cried Mablois.&#xD;
" We shall be likely to hear of him at Monsieur&#xD;
Ridelle's, for it is said he is smitten with the fair&#xD;
face of Adelaide."&#xD;
Arrived at Ridelle's, their astonishment can&#xD;
hardly be imagined when they were informed&#xD;
that a warrant had been issued for Pierre Mo-&#xD;
ran's arrest, and that to avoid imprisonment he&#xD;
had fled to the woods.&#xD;
&#xD;
A FAINT glow in the east heralded the com-&#xD;
ing day. Onalaska, chief of the Chickasaws,&#xD;
stood silently by the bay of St. Louis. Revolv-&#xD;
ing in his mind his own mighty plans, he had&#xD;
wandered away ffrpm his warriors through the&#xD;
pathless forest, nor stayed his footsteps until he&#xD;
reached the margin of Lake Borgne, at the fair&#xD;
bay bearing the name of the great king.&#xD;
With folded arms and abstracted air, he gazed.&#xD;
steadfastly upon the beautiful sheet of water now&#xD;
dimly lighted by the first crimson streaks of day-&#xD;
light. A shade of care and anxiety rested upon&#xD;
the chieftain's brow. Savage as he was, he had&#xD;
doubtless found the task ofagoverning and shap-&#xD;
ing the actions of a numerous people not an easy&#xD;
one.&#xD;
" How calmly the waters are sleeping," he&#xD;
said, musingly. " The red men rested as quietly&#xD;
among their native hills, before the pale faces&#xD;
came among them. But now there is no rest&#xD;
for the sons of the forest, once the undisturbed&#xD;
owners of this great country. Where now are&#xD;
the Indian's lakes and rivers, and hunting&#xD;
grounds ?"                     -&#xD;
Oaalaska paused. Painful thoughts agitated&#xD;
liis;bosom.&#xD;
"The white man and the red cannot occupy&#xD;
the same country," he added. " These French&#xD;
dogs must be swept away, or the 'Indians will&#xD;
&#xD;
perish. I feel that it must be: so ; something&#xD;
unseen and solemn seems to whisper it in my&#xD;
ear."&#xD;
Again the chieftain was silent. When he re-&#xD;
sumed, his voice was louder and sterner, and his&#xD;
brow was contracted into a forbidding frown.&#xD;
" If my brethren will be governed by me,'if they&#xD;
will keep the vows made in the sight of ihe Great&#xD;
Spirit, and written upon the clouds with his&#xD;
finger, we shall live to see the trees growing&#xD;
upon the ruins of the French settlement, and&#xD;
the deer feeding upon the grass where cotton is&#xD;
flourishing."&#xD;
A slight rustling among the dry leaves caused&#xD;
the warrior to lay his lhanmd upon his knife. A&#xD;
moment he stood in the fixed attitude of atten-&#xD;
tion, with his keen -eyes directed towatrds the&#xD;
surrounding trees. No object was visible, and&#xD;
the sound did not immediately recur.&#xD;
" It was the footstep of the timid hare or the&#xD;
sportive squirrel," said Onalaska to himself, and&#xD;
relapsed agfiin into a state of reverie.&#xD;
"The Africans despise their masters,{,ha&#xD;
added. " The red man has wisely taught them&#xD;
to hate servitude, and they are impatient forithe&#xD;
hour of emancipation. Already are they form-&#xD;
ing plans for the establishment of' a republic !&#xD;
Fools ! will the Indians'destroy the French, for&#xD;
the sake of giving the country-to spiritless cow&#xD;

"Mysears are open, daughter of the ' Suns.' "  " Onalaska, you have a fearless heart," said&#xD;
"The young Frenchman who is known among the princess. " Your hand is strong, -your voice&#xD;

"He knows nothing of the dangeraf Henri&#xD;
Delcroix. The distance to Walnut Village is&#xD;
considerable, and before anything could be done&#xD;
by the Great Sun, the friend of the Indiaamight&#xD;
be no 'more. Whatever is done for his rescue&#xD;
must be quickly done, for the justice of the great&#xD;
French chief does not linger.".&#xD;
"You speak well, La Glorieuse. It is far to&#xD;
the Walnut Village, and you have done wisely&#xD;
in seeking me. The White-Rover has the blood,&#xD;
of a hated race in his veins, but'it has become of&#xD;
a red color by mingling freely; among us. I&#xD;
would not have him slain for a crime.of which&#xD;
he is not guilty. He-s my friend ; and it were,&#xD;
shame that the friend of Onalaska should die&#xD;
without a single effort having been made to save'&#xD;
him."&#xD;
- " Your brave words make the heart of the&#xD;
Natchez maiden glad," replied La Glorieuse, joy-&#xD;
fully. " She knew that Red-Shoe would not for-&#xD;
sake the man he called his friend."&#xD;
"It shall never be said of Onalaska that he&#xD;
ran from an enemy,' or 'forsook his friend," re-&#xD;
plied the warrior, p oudly. " In this the proud&#xD;
princess has-not mistaken me ; but she knows&#xD;
not how truly the heart of the warrior loves her.&#xD;
She turns a deaf ear to his words ; she will not&#xD;
understand the language of his eyes and actions;&#xD;
yet the lodge fire of Onalaska will never burn&#xD;
brightly and cheerfully until she kindles it and&#xD;
sits beside it. It is well that the fair descendant&#xD;
of the 'Suns' is called 'The Proud."'&#xD;
The chieftain ceased, and folded his arms&#xD;
proudly, yet sorrowfully, upon his, broad chest.&#xD;
" There is a time for all things, great chieftain,"&#xD;
observed the princess, with gentle dignity. " The&#xD;
maiden Sun did not come hither in the hour of&#xD;
darkness to listen to the eloquent love tales of a&#xD;
brave warrior. She came to appeal to his mag-&#xD;
nanimity and courage in order to save a friend&#xD;
from death, though that friend be of another&#xD;
race. It were not comely in a princess of the&#xD;
blood to make a jo rrney to another nation to&#xD;
be wooed."-&#xD;
" The words of La Glorieuse are just, though&#xD;
they make the spirit of dnalaska sad," -returned&#xD;
the warrior, respectfully. " Love is a sentiment&#xD;
so strong in the hearts of brave men, that some-&#xD;
times it is hard to conceal it. With that power-&#xD;
ful sentiment the Ohickasaw  chief has long&#xD;
struggled in vain. He will still struggle and be&#xD;
aman"&#xD;
" The resolution is worthy oftyour great name&#xD;
and deeds of renown," said the princess, mildly.&#xD;

from her sweet lips," returne'  aska , in a&#xD;
voice soft as woman's when she  a pleasse.&#xD;
" Then must the subject be changed," replied&#xD;
La Glorieuse, with a pleasant smile. " Will the'&#xD;
chieftain tell the daughter of the Natchez what&#xD;
he proposes to do for the White Rover ?"&#xD;
" When the night has come, and darkness has&#xD;
fallen upon the face of the earth, Onalaska will&#xD;
seek the village of the French. His step shall&#xD;
be soft as the falling snow. He will steal along&#xD;
like the crawling serpent. He will scale the&#xD;
prison fence, remove the bars of a window, and&#xD;
the White Rover shall be tree."&#xD;
"The war-chief will need the aid of a white&#xD;
man," said La Glorieuse. "There is one called&#xD;
Pierre Moran, who might be useful."&#xD;
"He is a brave man, though a Frenchman,"&#xD;
replied Onalaska. " He was but lately rescued&#xD;
from the warriors of Onalaska by the hand-of&#xD;
the White Rover. His heart is large towards&#xD;
him, Red-Shoe will' consider upon what La&#xD;
Glorieuse has said."'&#xD;
" The errand of the Natchez girl' is done," re-&#xD;
plied the princess. '" Her heart is full of grati-&#xD;
tude. She will hasten back to speak comforting&#xD;
words to the woman of the soft voice."&#xD;
With a smile and a graceful wave of the hand,&#xD;
she turned and walked quickly away. Onalaska&#xD;
gazed after her until her figure was hidden by&#xD;
the trees. The first rays of the rising sun' fell&#xD;
along the quiet lake.. With a sigh Onalaska&#xD;
sought the encampment of his warriors.&#xD;
The chieftain had gone but a short distance,&#xD;
when, emerging from the shade of some tall&#xD;
sycamores, he perceived a white man with a&#xD;
rifle on his shoulder, moving rapidly towards&#xD;
Lake Pontchartrain.&#xD;
"Pierre Moran !" shouted Red-Shoe, in aloud&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
The hunter stopped and looked about him,&#xD;
Suddenly his eyes rested on the majestic figure&#xD;
of Onalaska. He cocked his rifle, and bringing&#xD;
it to his shoulder, laid his face upon the breech&#xD;
and glanced 'along the deadly barrel.&#xD;
" Hold !" cried Red-Shoe ;-"I have news from&#xD;
the White Rover."&#xD;
The breech of Pierre Moran's rifle fell to the&#xD;
ground when the sound of the White Rover's&#xD;
name reached his ears.&#xD;
" We did not part on the best of terms, Ona'&#xD;

order that I may not betray his plans. It is&#xD;
not safe to listen to every idle rumor, nor to&#xD;
write a man down a villain because his face is&#xD;
not a prepossessing one. That shot was aimed&#xD;
at me," said Moran.&#xD;
" And if he does not eventually succeed in&#xD;
killing you, it will be because you bear a charmed&#xD;
life," returned Red-Shoe.&#xD;
" I have often heard the name of the Natchez&#xD;
renegade, but never met him in my wanderings;&#xD;
but if chance should ever throw him in my way,&#xD;
he will not live to say he has seen Pierre Moran&#xD;
again-the hunter of the Mississippi Valley."&#xD;
" If there is anything on earth that my soul&#xD;
turns from with loathing, it is a renegade," said&#xD;
Red-Shoe.&#xD;
"And a coward, you might have added," said&#xD;
Pierre.&#xD;
" It is well thought of, brave Frenchman. A&#xD;
renegade and a coward may be coupled together,&#xD;
and not be unequally yoked."&#xD;
While Red-Shoe was speaking, an object met&#xD;
the eye of Pierre Moran well calculated to try&#xD;
the courage of both. The hunter's practised ear&#xD;
had heard a slight sound among the branches of&#xD;
the trees. Looking up with the-quickness of a vet-&#xD;
eran of the woods, he saw a huge and wellknown&#xD;
animal crouched upon the limb of-a lofty oak,&#xD;
not a dozen yards from the chief, who was a&#xD;
little in advance.    -&#xD;
"Look !" said the hunter, in a suppressed&#xD;
voice; without withdrawing his fixed gaze from&#xD;
the terrible monster. The warrior raised his eyes&#xD;
And saw death staring 'him in the face ; for it&#xD;
was the animal most dreaded   the red men,&#xD;
and called almost universally by the singular&#xD;
name of the'" Indian Devil."&#xD;
The bravest of the brave, if he discovered the&#xD;
track of the paonther when' hunting, turned back&#xD;
with a shudder. He feared to encounter an&#xD;
animal so powerful, and endowed with a cunning&#xD;
almost human. lie had rather meet some war&#xD;
party of his enemies at fearful odds, for with,&#xD;
them he could fight with-some hope of success;&#xD;
but who could contend with a foe that could not&#xD;

be seen until his resistless paws were rending&#xD;
him in pieces, or until he looked down from&#xD;
some stately tree in the act of springing i No ;&#xD;
the Indian did not choose to make war upon the&#xD;
sagacious and all-conquering panther.&#xD;
Onalaska met the gaze of the monster with&#xD;
Roman firmness. The fore paws of the animal&#xD;
were thrust out along a large limb, and the&#xD;
hinder legs were drawn up under him. The hair&#xD;
upon the back seemed to stand erect, and there&#xD;
was an undulating, snaky motion of the long&#xD;
tail. The eyes sent forth malignant fires-&#xD;
flashed and burned like glowing coals. The&#xD;
mouth was slightly open, displaying rows of&#xD;
white, sharp teeth, and the tongue lying within&#xD;
them like the sting of some monster serpent.&#xD;
His hot breath seemed to have infected the air&#xD;
and made it rank with the odor of death. The&#xD;
long bristling hair about the huge jaw i-worked&#xD;
and trembled with the quivering motion of the&#xD;
nether lip-an indication of hostility too deadly&#xD;
not to be well known to the observant eye of the&#xD;
hunter.&#xD;
The hand of Red-Shoe was, upon his knife.&#xD;
He had laid it there at the moment of looking&#xD;
upward ; for he had left his rifle at the encamp-&#xD;
ment-a neglect which now promised to prove&#xD;
fatal to the chief. The panther was evidently&#xD;
about to leap, and had chosen the nearest vie.&#xD;
tim; this the proud Indian knewi but governing,&#xD;
with the strength of a diseiplined and mighty&#xD;
will, the natural shrinkings of human nature, he&#xD;
appeared calm and self-reliant.&#xD;
The panther drew himself back. upon his&#xD;
haunches, with his fore feet still placed cat-like&#xD;
upon the trunk of the limb, while the motions&#xD;
of the tail-grew quicker and more deeided,a and&#xD;
the eyes literally appeared to dart rays of4flame.&#xD;
- The nerves of the hunter were still. ,There&#xD;
was no'tremor of the ha d or heart when he&#xD;
suddenly raised his rifle; no film of teo  idims&#xD;

brought the unerring sights to bear -upon' the&#xD;

that Pierre Moran was not the man he had been&#xD;
represented, was filled with apprehension. He&#xD;
bad good reason to fear that his dark plottings,&#xD;
for the destruction of Henry Delcroix, might&#xD;
transpie and come to the ears of the governor,&#xD;
wich'tught result in the most serious conse-&#xD;
&#xD;
quences to himself. In order to prevent an ex-&#xD;
posure so important, and perhaps ,fatal, he de-&#xD;
termitned to involve Pierre Moran in the.same&#xD;
destruction which he had so ingeniously prepared&#xD;
for Henri.' Being now on intimate, terms with&#xD;
his excellency, on account of the ;valuable ser-&#xD;
vice he had, apparently, rendered under;circum-&#xD;
stances of peculiar emergency, it needed but ,a&#xD;
word to procure.the arrest of; Moran; but the&#xD;
latter; as we have seen, fled to rthe woods in time&#xD;
to avoid the catastrophe.'&#xD;
Thus baffled; the captain resolved upon anoth-&#xD;
er plan of operation. ,He lost no tithe in-finding&#xD;
Ette-Actal, who. for a trifling sum,. agreed.to&#xD;
rid hims of-one he had;so mugch r ontoo dread.&#xD;
Stimulated by the hope of reward, and urged on&#xD;
by the natural 'cruelty of his disposition,,the&#xD;
renegade had 'entered with alacrity upon the&#xD;
task assigned- him, An opportunity offered&#xD;
itself sooner than he expected; but he had missed&#xD;
his aarky and received in return a painfutlthugh&#xD;
not dangerous wound in the shoulder. Recov-&#xD;
ering from the momentary shock, he ranforward&#xD;
with great swiftness, and abated not his speed&#xD;
until he reached the border'of the French settle-&#xD;
ment. Feeling comparatively safe from pursuit,&#xD;
he proceeded to bind up his wound as well as&#xD;
the circumstancesof the case would admit.&#xD;
Having completed this necessary task, he sa&#xD;

THE WHII&#xD;
&#xD;
down upon a mossy knoll, smarting with pain&#xD;
and faint with loss of blood. The renegade,&#xD;
like many of his race, was extravagantly fond&#xD;
of fire-water, and while cogitating a plan to&#xD;
gratify his taste for the dangerous beverage, the&#xD;
pain of his wound gradually ceased, and over-&#xD;
come with fatigue, he sank into a profound slum-&#xD;
ber. From this happy state of'unconsciousness&#xD;
he was aroused by a gentle touch upon his&#xD;
shoulder.&#xD;
Upon opening his heavy eyes, with a start of&#xD;
surprise, he beheld Lesage standing beside him&#xD;
with an anxious expression upon his face.&#xD;
"What news ?" he asked, hurriedly.&#xD;
The renegade looked vacantly into his face&#xD;
without reply.&#xD;
" Mon Dieu! what ails the man !" he exclaimed,&#xD;
impatiently. " Can 'you' tell 'me anything of&#xD;
Pierre Moran ?" he added, quickly.&#xD;
"White hunter has gone long journey," re-&#xD;
plied the Indian, gravely.&#xD;
"Where is he gone ? Why did you let him&#xD;
escape ?" asked Lesage.&#xD;
"Gone towards the south-way- very long-&#xD;
never come back."&#xD;
" What.!" exclaimed the 'lying chief,' his face&#xD;
lighting up with a sudden gleam of intelligence&#xD;
and triumph.&#xD;
" The land of souls is far off," added the rene-&#xD;
gade. "When the red man goes-there he travels&#xD;
toward the south, through great forests and over&#xD;
high mountains, until he reaches the' river that&#xD;
separates the happy hunting grounds from the&#xD;
country of mortal men ; there he finds a white&#xD;
stone canoe, and passes over to'the country of]&#xD;
shadows. The White hunter has gone there, and'&#xD;
now talks with the shadowy people."&#xD;
"When was the deed done, and how ?" asked&#xD;
Lesage, in an eager and excited tone.&#xD;
" Does thehench chief see this I" said the-&#xD;
renegade, po  ing to his blanket,'which was&#xD;
saturated' with'blood.&#xD;
" I see-.you are wounded,'? answered 'Lesage.&#xD;
" Yes; I found the hunter in the woods. He&#xD;
was not alone.' -He was talking wi hiReddShoe,&#xD;
the great'+ arrior. As -I steod watching him, I-&#xD;
stepped upon a dry limb and made a noise. He&#xD;
looked up and saw me. The white hunter: is&#xD;
very skilful 'with  his rifle, and he fired, before I.&#xD;
could cock my gun, ant I received a ball inmy&#xD;

" Very sure, for I took aiin at his head. Nei&#xD;

For a short time the captain was 'silent, le'.&#xD;
apparently, in the mazes of his own thought.&#xD;
"Are you badly wounded ?" he asked, looking&#xD;
steadfastly at the renegade.&#xD;
" Very sore; have much pain; want str&#xD;
water," said the renegade.&#xD;
" I have a bottle of the fire-water in my&#xD;
et," replied Lesage. " It will do you good."'&#xD;
The captain paused, and looked toward Lake&#xD;
Borgne intently.&#xD;
" I thought I heard a sound," he added, with&#xD;
well, affected alarm. "Ette-Actal, your-eyes&#xD;
are quick and strong ; look steadfastly in that&#xD;
direction."&#xD;
The renegade turned his eyes towards the&#xD;
point indicated, and gazed fixedly, for he had&#xD;
some fears that it might be Pierre Moran him.&#xD;
self. While he was thus engaged, Lesage emp.&#xD;
tied into the' bottle he had drawn from his pocket,&#xD;
the contents of-a small phial. When the rene-&#xD;
gade turned towards him, again, the captain&#xD;
placed the bottle of strong-water in his' hand.&#xD;

hunting grounds, and to dream of the white stone&#xD;
canoe, with its shining paddles, which floats on&#xD;
the waters of the river of life. Drink,,red man,&#xD;

The renegade placed the bottle beneath his&#xD;
blanket with a smile of satisfaction.&#xD;
"You have done me an iitportant service,"&#xD;
added Lesage. '"Come to- me to-morrow, and&#xD;
I will give you twenty pounds." - There waa a&#xD;
smile--though scarcely perceptible-of(peculiar&#xD;

spoke these words and turned away. In a few&#xD;
minutes he' had'disappeared 'among the trees,&#xD;
repeating to himself his :last remark.&#xD;
«' Yet, come -te"me to-mOrrow, and I will give&#xD;

said : 'Ette-Actial, your eyes are strong and&#xD;
f quick ; look steadfastly towards Lake Borgne.'&#xD;
While you were doing as you were bidden, he&#xD;
-drugged the fire-water."&#xD;
"I thank you, princess," said the renegade,&#xD;
with some feeling. " And though I am cast out&#xD;
from among my people, and wander up and&#xD;
down with the broad brand of infamy upon my&#xD;
brow, I will not forget this service. If the time&#xD;
should -ever come when one like me can serve&#xD;
La Glorieuse, I shall be ready to peril my life&#xD;
for her sake."&#xD;
"It is well," replied the princess, in a more&#xD;
friendly tone. "Even a renegade may have&#xD;
some feelings in common with others. You&#xD;
have rendered yourself unworthy to serve me,&#xD;
but I will forget it and allow you to render me&#xD;
an important service."&#xD;
" Speak your will, princess," replied Ette-Ac-&#xD;

" Hasten to the Walnut Village,and tell Stung-&#xD;

the bravest warriors without delay. Bid him&#xD;
mount them upon the fleetest horses, and to send,&#xD;

La Glorieuse.&#xD;
"But no one would speak to me, orcredit my&#xD;
words, should I do as you bid me," returned the&#xD;
renegade, while his red face grew crimson with&#xD;
shame.&#xD;
"I understand," resumed the princess,drawing&#xD;
a ring from her finger. " Take this, and it will'&#xD;
save you from insult and abuse.  boldly, and&#xD;
fear nothing. But I had nearly  otten your&#xD;

" Speak it, my good Helen," added the prie t,&#xD;

Bienville. A servant assured him that the gov-&#xD;
ernor was engaged and could not be seen ; but&#xD;
the good old man, stimulated by his love for his-&#xD;
young friend, had urgently persisted in his re-&#xD;
quest.&#xD;
"Go back," said Davion, with dignity, "and&#xD;
tell your master that his old friend-a man with&#xD;
white hairs-demands audience."&#xD;
Awed by the dignified and authoritative air&#xD;
of Father Davion, the attendant obeyed, and&#xD;
soon returned with the welcome intelligence that&#xD;
his excellency would grant him a very brief in-&#xD;
terview in the course of half an- hour. Bidding&#xD;
him wait the governor's leisure in the ante-room,&#xD;
the servant withdrew. His heart was a prey to&#xD;
the most intense anxiety. He paced the apart-&#xD;
ment' impatiently, indulging in a thousand con-&#xD;
jectires in relation to the cause of Henri's arrest.&#xD;
"Father Davion!" said a gentle voice.&#xD;
. " Helen Lerowe i" exclaimed the priest;while&#xD;
a momentary gleam-of happiness and hope irra-&#xD;
diated his v  1le face. " I was thinking -of&#xD;
you. - Can ' nform me what this strange pro-&#xD;
ceeding portends'?"&#xD;
"I do not comprehend you. I know not to&#xD;
what proceeding you allude," replied Helen,&#xD;
somewhat confused, for at that moment she re-&#xD;
called to mind what had passed between herself&#xD;
and Henri upon the morning of that very day.&#xD;
"Henri Deleroix has been arrested by the&#xD;
order of the governor, and is now in prison,"&#xD;
said i)vion.&#xD;

"Most fervently and humbly I join in the pe-&#xD;

* Can you tell me who is with the governor ?"&#xD;
"Captain Lesage," replied Helen.&#xD;
"Filling his ears with poison," added Davion,&#xD;
with emphasis. "I must fathom that mat-I&#xD;

blackest of all sins-the .extreme wickedness of&#xD;
betraying his countrymen to a cruel and re-&#xD;
morseless enemy, selling helpless women and&#xD;
children to the hatchet and scalping knife. He&#xD;
is a traitor-forgetful of the hand that fed him,&#xD;
of the people who gave him  a home, of the&#xD;
blood that flows in his veins ; and by all that is&#xD;
sacred, were he my own son, or my own brother,&#xD;
he should die before forty-eight hours, were it&#xD;
the last act of my administration."&#xD;
"No ! no !" exclaimed Father Davion, trem-&#xD;
bling with the violence of his emotions. " It&#xD;
cannot be so ; there must be some mistake. It&#xD;
is not in human nature to be so base."&#xD;
"Father Davion," said the governor, in tones&#xD;
of thrilling solemnity, "there is no mistake ; but&#xD;
I would that mistake were possible. !I have&#xD;
proof positive of his guilt. Do not, as you love.&#xD;
justice, and respect yourself, and me, and the,&#xD;
authority vested in me, attempt: to move me to&#xD;
compassion, or to shake my resolution. I tell&#xD;
you there is no alternative; he must die-and&#xD;
he stalll.,&#xD;
While de Bienville spoke, his eyes flashed&#xD;
fire, his nostrils seemed to dilate like those of&#xD;
the war-horse when he smells the battle afar off,&#xD;
and feels that he must rush into the thickestof&#xD;
the fight ; his chest-rose and fell with the vio-&#xD;
lence - of his emotions, and his fingers worked&#xD;
convulsively upon the pen which he held in his&#xD;
right hand.&#xD;
" With this,,my pen," he added, in a voice of&#xD;
deep energy "I will sign the death warrant of&#xD;
Henri DeleroixI"       -&#xD;
Father Davion was awed by the solemn and&#xD;
energetic manner of de Bienville.&#xD;
" Be.calm," he said, after a pause, "and let,&#xD;
me hear what proof you have , of Henri's guilt."&#xD;
The governor then entered in  detailed ac-&#xD;
count of the whole conspiracy,    derstood&#xD;
it. The testimony of Captain Lesage was ad-&#xD;
duced, bolstered up by the testimony of the ne-&#xD;
groes ; and all the evidence that tended to crim-&#xD;
mate Henri was skilfully summed up..&#xD;
When he had:finished, he looked sorrowfully&#xD;
at Father Davion. The latter was confounded ;&#xD;
for the chain of evidence was indeed very per-&#xD;
fect, and no links appeared wanting.&#xD;
" Can you now say, good father, that Irhave .&#xD;
not followed the dictates of a sound judgment in&#xD;
condemning this young man ?" said the gov-&#xD;
ernor.&#xD;
"I see, indeed, a startling array of -evidence;&#xD;

For a moment hes&#xD;

By a masterly effort the&#xD;

governor recovered i a measure his self-posses-&#xD;
sion. The color ca e back - to his face ; he&#xD;
passed his hand-over is brow as if collecting his&#xD;
scattered thoughts, a d then replied in avoice&#xD;
tolerably calm, thong much changed:&#xD;
"This is strange ne s indeed ; it fills me with&#xD;
astonishment. How ong since you were certain&#xD;
of this"  4&#xD;
"Within the hour   I had it from Helen's&#xD;
lips."&#xD;
"Leave me, Father avion," said de Bienville,&#xD;
abruptly. "I would fain be alone.. I am as&#xD;
tired of governing as ever Sancho Panza was&#xD;
when he was governo of Barrataria."&#xD;
"Do not act hastil," added Davion. "Re-&#xD;
member that he is to me as Benjamin was to&#xD;
Jacob. If, aught sho ld befall the young man,&#xD;
it would bring down  y gray hairs in sorrow to&#xD;
the grave. For my s ke, and for Helen's sake,&#xD;
be merciful, and be ju t also."&#xD;
"Be assured that I ill be just," returned the&#xD;
governor, somewhat coldly.&#xD;
&#xD;
"One word more, your excellency; do not&#xD;
forget that I do not yet believe Henri guilt;&#xD;
however much circumstances may seen to critn&#xD;
inate him."&#xD;
"Who do you suspect of plotting against&#xD;
him ?&#xD;
" Captain Lesage," replied the priest,promptly.&#xD;
"And for What'reason ?"&#xD;
"Because he regards him in the light of ,&#xD;
dangerous rival."&#xD;
" Such baseness cannot ,exist,"- rejoined de&#xD;
Bienville.&#xD;
"Perhaps you are not aware that Captain&#xD;
Lesage is already known among the Indians as&#xD;
Chef Menteur, or lying chief," added Father&#xD;
Davion.&#xD;
" Considering how much you love the young&#xD;
man, I pardon the insinuations which you are&#xD;
pleased to make against the character of a brave&#xD;
'nd zealous officer," returned the governor,&#xD;
coldly.&#xD;
"He has zeal, it is true; but I much doubt&#xD;
that it is according to knowledge," replied Fa-&#xD;
her Davion.&#xD;
We shall see ; good night, Father Davion."&#xD;
"Good night, your excellency, and may God&#xD;
grant you the excellent wisdom of a Daniel to&#xD;
detect the hidden wickedness of this matter."&#xD;
Bowing respectfully, the priest left the pres-&#xD;
nce of the governor. Helen was awaiting him&#xD;
n the ante-room, with pale and anxious face.&#xD;
The sorrowful looks of Father Davion did not&#xD;
e   to re-assure her. She would have gladly&#xD;
sked many questions, but her tongue refused to&#xD;
perform its office.&#xD;
"You desire to know the worst," said the&#xD;
rest, kindly taking Helen by the hand. "I. vi*l&#xD;
ell you the truth and conceal nothing from you&#xD;
enriis in imminent peril."&#xD;
" With what crime is 'he charged ?" asked Hel&#xD;
n, with a strong effort.&#xD;
" The crime of selling his country to the In-&#xD;
ians," said Davion.&#xD;
"It is a base slander !" exclaimed Helen.&#xD;
Henri Deleroix is not guilty of such wicked-&#xD;
i ess. He is too good, too generous, too noble 1!&#xD;
"So I believe, my daughter; and I love to&#xD;
hear you speak, his praise when other tongzes&#xD;
revile him."&#xD;
Father Davion then explained the nature of&#xD;
the evidence which was to convict the young&#xD;
man of so heinous a crime. During the recital4&#xD;
the cheeks of Helen glowed with indignation.&#xD;
" The plat is deep ,and dangerous, and artfully&#xD;

first emotions upon fin&#xD;
&#xD;
ur naders, we will now re-&#xD;
ur story, whom we left in&#xD;
us upon his hands. His&#xD;
ing himself so unceremo-&#xD;
&#xD;
niously incarcerated  ere those of indignation,&#xD;
and surprise. .&#xD;
Utterly ignorant of what crime he was accused,&#xD;
he taxed his imagination in vain for an adequate&#xD;
cause for such treatm nt. That Lesage was the&#xD;
active 'agent of his  isfortunes, he did not&#xD;
doubt; but the meads employed was the subject&#xD;
that perplexed him. Guilty of no infractions&#xD;
upon the laws of the colony, he was far from&#xD;
entertaining..even a suspicion of his danger.&#xD;
The thought which annoyed him most deeply&#xD;
was a well-defined fear that he might be dis-&#xD;
graced in the eyes of Helen Lerowe; or that by&#xD;
some means Bering his incarceration, she might&#xD;
be induced to bestow her hand, upon Lesage.&#xD;
This was truly a painful subject of reflection to&#xD;
Henri.&#xD;
Weary of thinking and forming conjectures,&#xD;
before morning he fell into a troubled sleep. It&#xD;
was a late hour when he awoke. The sun was'&#xD;
two hours high, and his beams were streaming&#xD;
brightly into the prison through the grated win-&#xD;
dows. The turnkey entered with water and&#xD;
food; and though he waited a rfoment evidently&#xD;
with the expectation of being questioned, Henri&#xD;
was tooproud to ask anything in relation to his&#xD;
imprisonment, and suffered him to depart with-.&#xD;
out Interchanging a:single word with him.&#xD;
&#xD;
Withlhis foot Henri dashed, thejug of water&#xD;
against the wall, and the coarse bread soon share.&#xD;
ed the same fate. Smiling at his own impatience,&#xD;
he arose and walked up and down his narrow&#xD;
cell, occasionally pausing to note how strangely&#xD;
the handcuffs looked upon hie wrists.&#xD;
While thus employed, the door of his prison&#xD;
grated once more-upon its hinges and a file of men&#xD;
entered, headed by Sergeant Dumont. Obeying&#xD;
the motions of their leader, the armed men&#xD;
placed themselves upon each side of Henri, and&#xD;
he was cornlucted from the prison - to the pres-&#xD;
ence of the governor. The latter was surround:-&#xD;
ed by several of the principal officers of the cot..&#xD;
ony, and the members of his council, among&#xD;
whom were the Chevalier de Noyan, lieutenant&#xD;
governor; Chevalier de Loubois, the; laren of&#xD;

As the eyes of Henri wandered from one te&#xD;

heart. Why were the principal men of Louisiang&#xD;
present ? - What important crisis or emergency&#xD;
had called thera.pogether ?&#xD;

St Ange to the Chevalier de Noyan, who sat&#xD;
wear him.&#xD;
-$He carries himself like a belted knight," re-&#xD;
Plied the lieutenant governor.&#xD;
"A noble figure !" said St. Julian, in the same&#xD;
tone. -&#xD;
"He bears himself bravely," added the Baron&#xD;
of Cresnay, while a buzz of approbation ran&#xD;
through the court-room; for many of the prin-&#xD;
cipal citizens had heard of the arrest, and been&#xD;
admitted to witness the trial, as his excellency&#xD;
did not wish to conduct the unfortunate affair&#xD;
wholly in private. Henri was a general favorite,&#xD;
and he was anxious that the whole might be&#xD;
conducted in an impartial manner, in order that&#xD;
there should be no murmuring or complaint.&#xD;
"He has not the face of a traitor," resumed&#xD;
de St. Ange.&#xD;
"He certainly has not," replied Chevalier de&#xD;
Bessan ; "but judging from appearances is not&#xD;
always righteous judgment, you know," he add-&#xD;

At the point of de Noyan's speech,$Henri, who&#xD;

ed the whole subject at a glance. He saw him-&#xD;
self standing, as it were, upon the brink of a&#xD;
precipice, and many'unfriendly hands outstretch-&#xD;
ed to thrust him headlong into the abyss. He&#xD;
staggered beneath the terrible charge, and for a&#xD;
moment, it was with difficulty that he could&#xD;
stand without support. Crushed and overwhelm-&#xD;
ed, he sank back into his seat the moment de&#xD;
Noyan had ceased speaking.&#xD;
" The young fellow is by no means without&#xD;
feeling," whispered St. Julian to de Bessan.&#xD;
The latter made no reply, and Captain.Lesage&#xD;
was called totestify. He deposed and said that&#xD;
it was with extreme reluctance that he arose to&#xD;
criminate the prisoner at the bar, he being a&#xD;
young man whom he had hitherto esteemed;&#xD;
but he would come to the point at once, and not&#xD;
deter the court longer than was absolutely neces-&#xD;
sary.&#xD;
Recently, 'le averred, it had pleased his&#xD;
excellency, on account of the hostile bearing of&#xD;
the various Indian tribes, to enjoin him to un-&#xD;
common vigilance in the discharge of his-official&#xD;
duties. These - instructions, as in duty bound,&#xD;
he had endeavored. to obey to the letter, and in&#xD;
the discharge of his duty, it had been his for-&#xD;
tune to discoverlthe existence of the most alarm-&#xD;
ing and dangerous conspiracy that had ever&#xD;
threatened and agitated that unhappy colony.&#xD;
The first hints that he received of this matter&#xD;
were from his servant, who is a Banbara negro-&#xD;
Induced by love for his master, and proinises of&#xD;
liberal reward,'he revealed the startling news&#xD;
that all the Africans in the colony had conspired&#xD;
with the Indians for -the 'total destruction of&#xD;
their masters, and'all the French settlements in&#xD;
Louisiana.&#xD;
He-drew from him, moreover, that the whole&#xD;
plot was devised and perpetrated by a young&#xD;
Frenchman. At a given time ali The Indian na-&#xD;
tions were to rise simultaneously,'and, assisted&#xD;
by the slaves, slay the whole population india-&#xD;
critninately, without regard to age, sex, or&#xD;
condition.&#xD;
Exclamations of horror and indignation were&#xD;
heard in all parts of the room, at this portion of&#xD;
the captain's, testimony. With flushed cheek'&#xD;
and throbbing brow, Henri sat gazing steadily&#xD;
at Lesage. -It was only by a strong mental&#xD;
effort' that he could curb his resentment and&#xD;
keep it within bounds. His impulsive nature&#xD;
prompited hiin to -leap from the prisoner's box&#xD;
and str~dgle' the captain: on the' spot; but li&#xD;
better judgment told him the folly 'of sicha ~&#xD;
thought.'&#xD;
&#xD;
.I&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
The captain went on with much apparent feel-&#xD;
ing, and related the manner in which he had-&#xD;
discovered that the prisoner at the bar was the&#xD;
leader of the conspiracy.' While hunting in the&#xD;
woods, near Lake Pontchartrain, he had over-&#xD;
heard a conversation between the prisoner and:&#xD;
one Pierre Moran, known among the Indians by&#xD;
the name of the Hunter. Greatly to deponent's&#xD;
horror, he had heard the whole plan of the con-&#xD;
spiracy discussed in the most cool and business-,&#xD;
like manner.&#xD;
At this stage of the captain's evidence, he en-&#xD;
tered into many minute and tedious details with&#xD;
which we shall not trouble the reader ; but suffice&#xD;
it that his testimony was delivered with the most&#xD;
consummate art, and made a deep impression.&#xD;
At some portions, it was extremely difficult for&#xD;
de Noyan to maintain order, so much were the&#xD;
citizens excited against the accused.&#xD;
The birch bark found upon his person at the,&#xD;
time of his arrest was then produced, and the&#xD;
diagrams and characters briefly and ingeniously&#xD;
explained., Henri acknowledged his signature&#xD;
at the bottom.&#xD;
Seven or eight of the Banbaras were then&#xD;
brought forward by the captain, and rendered&#xD;
their evidence with surprising readiness and&#xD;
unanimity.&#xD;
The guilt of Henri seemed indeed to have&#xD;
been fairly proved. No rebutting testimony was&#xD;
offered, and the excitement among the citizens&#xD;
was every moment growing more intense.&#xD;
The governor, in a stern voice, then asked&#xD;
the prisoner what he had to say in extenuation&#xD;
of his guilt.&#xD;
With eyes flashing with scorn and indignation,&#xD;
Henri arose to his feet. He folded his arms.&#xD;
upon his breast, and for a moment looked boldly&#xD;
around those present. His gaze at length rested&#xD;
upon Lesage, and his nether lip quivered with&#xD;
unutterable contempt.. Drawing up his com-&#xD;
manding figure until he was the most conspicu-&#xD;
ous object in the room, while every muscle&#xD;
seemed to work with emotion, and with a sense&#xD;
of the indignity which 'had been offered, and the&#xD;
wrong heaped upon him, he slowly stretched&#xD;
forth his arms, and pointing his finger at Lesage,&#xD;
said, in a calm, impressive, yet terrible voice:&#xD;
"I pronounce that man a perjured villain.&#xD;
The aggravated charges which he has made&#xD;
against.me, I throw back into his teeth with a&#xD;
feeling of scorn too great to utter." Then turn-&#xD;
ing to the governor, he added, in a firm, yet re-&#xD;
spectful voice: " Your excellency, I protest that&#xD;
&#xD;
I am not guilty, though circumstances in ie&#xD;
possession of a villain have conspibed'tooeidit&#xD;
me. I see'but too plainly my position. Ik no*&#xD;
what awaits me. I will not consume- 'tim by&#xD;
reiterating my innocence ; for I perceive thatnfy&#xD;
ruin is accomplished, that my death' is needfil&#xD;
to one present-whose name I will not conde-&#xD;
scend to speak. It is true that there isa coi-&#xD;
spiracy on foot, 'but I am not, neverwas,An&#xD;
would scorn to be, its leader. It was bit yesto.&#xD;
day that I discovered its existence, 'thoughI&#xD;
have been free to mix with all the Indian'tribes&#xD;
from first to last. In this important movement&#xD;
I was not admitted-to their confidence. * It has&#xD;
been said in evidence against me that have&#xD;
power over the minds of the red men'; it is true.&#xD;
Were I at large and so disposed, I could sweep&#xD;
away all the French settlements in a day; and at&#xD;
night there would not be a single dwelling stand-&#xD;
ing, and every head would be scalped. But,&#xD;
thank Heaven I I love my countrymen too well&#xD;
to wish them such a fate ; and it gives me plead-&#xD;
ure, while 1 stand in this august presence,'&#xD;
know that I have saved them more' than one&#xD;
from bloody reprisals. Governor de Bienville,&#xD;
permit me to advise you to station an effieiert-&#xD;
body of men at Natchez, and' to, increase 'the&#xD;
number of soldiers and the means of defence at&#xD;
Mobile, Pensacola,' and .Dauphine Island;'anal&#xD;
in return I ask but one favor (if the perjurer&#xD;
must have a victim), that r may die a soldier's&#xD;
death. I have done."&#xD;
The White Rover bowed and sat down.&#xD;
"What a proud and fearless spirit we are&#xD;
about to extinguish," said the Baron of Cresnag&#xD;
to St. Ange, in a low voice, as Henri resumed&#xD;
his seat.&#xD;
" I will tell-you who he reminds me of," rO-&#xD;
plied St. Ange. "He makes me think of' Ibee&#xD;
ville, de Bienville's brother."&#xD;
The word Iberville reached the ears f the&#xD;
governor, and he turned quickly towards  .&#xD;
Ange. The latter looked towards the White&#xD;
Rover, and de Bienville seemed6lost in reflectio.&#xD;
" Let the prisoner be removed from the barfor&#xD;
a short time," said the governor. "Good'cit&#xD;
zeus, whose opinions are not required in 'the&#xD;
case, will withdraw."&#xD;
Henri, closely guarded, was taken to another&#xD;
part of the edifice, and very soon the hall of&#xD;
judgment was vacated by all save the governor&#xD;
and his officials.&#xD;
Their discussions were short. The prisoner&#xD;
was placed again at the bar. The'ecrowd came&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE lSCAPIn,&#xD;
&#xD;
Tr was the hour of midnight. The sure her-&#xD;
aIds of a storm were in the skies: Dark masses&#xD;
of clouds were seen, at first low on the horizon's&#xD;
verge, and then rapidly floating towards the&#xD;
zenith, The low mutterings of distant thunder&#xD;
broke in upon the silence of the night, and fitful&#xD;
flashes of lightning.were seen far away in the&#xD;
west and north.&#xD;
Pierre Moran was abroad at that gloomy hour.&#xD;
He was moving swiftly towards Pontchartrain&#xD;
from the southern margin of Lake Borgne. With&#xD;
his trusty and inseparable companion, his dou-&#xD;
-ble-barrelled rifle, grasped firmly in his right&#xD;
hand, he threaded his way skilfully through the,&#xD;
forest.&#xD;
When near the borders of the lake he paused&#xD;
and.listened with a breathless intensity known&#xD;
only to the practised woodsman. Very soon he&#xD;
,heard the shrill notes of a raven, and going for-&#xD;
ward in the direction of the sound, in a few mo-&#xD;
ments stood beside the tall figure of Red-Shoe,&#xD;
the Chickasaw chieftain.&#xD;
As Pierre joined him, a flash of lightning lit&#xD;
up the expanse, and threw a vivid glare upon&#xD;
the face of the red maw; it wat calm, proud, and&#xD;
naughty as ever in its-expression.&#xD;
"You imitate the notes of the raven well,"&#xD;
said Pierre.&#xD;
:I. tok my lessons from nature," replied Red-&#xD;
Shoe, with a smile.&#xD;
&#xD;
"How do you like the night ? Is it not favor&#xD;
able to our undertaking ?" asked the hunter.&#xD;
" When the voice of the Great Spirit is heard&#xD;
in the heavens, and his fire is seen in the clouds,&#xD;
men seek shelter in their lodges and cabins,&#xD;
and warriors relax their vigilance. The night&#xD;
is good," replied Onalaska.&#xD;
Without farther remark, Pierre Moran and&#xD;
Red-Shoe moved towards New Orleans. After&#xD;
a short and rapid walk, they emerged silently&#xD;
from the forest and stood within the borders of&#xD;
the town.- Both now halted and prepared them-&#xD;
selves for the hazardous enterprise upon which&#xD;
they had voluntarily entered. They examined&#xD;
their rifles, tightened their belts, and carefully&#xD;
arranged their side arms.&#xD;
" You shall lead the way, and I will follow,'&#xD;
said Pierre Moran, who had much confidence&#xD;
in the skill of the chieftain.&#xD;
- " It is well, since my white brother requests&#xD;
it," answered Red-Shoe. " shall go forward&#xD;
very still, as though I was going to surprise a&#xD;
party .of my enemies while they were asleep.&#xD;
The great hunter will follow me very close and&#xD;
make no noise. When we are near the:stone&#xD;
house where the White Rover is kept, thenmust&#xD;
we look out for the long-knives whe tthe fire&#xD;
burns up bright in the skies."&#xD;
" And if.we find the sentinels watchful and&#xD;

II&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WHITE ROVER.&#xD;
&#xD;
true to their duty, what then shall we do ?" asked&#xD;
Pierre Moran.&#xD;
The chieftain smiled grimly, as he replied -&#xD;
"Do as they would if they went to surprise an&#xD;
Indian village, creep softly--leap upon them as&#xD;
thepanther leaps upon its prey-let the knife do&#xD;
its work and reach a vital spot. I would do that,&#xD;
white hunter."&#xD;
"They are my countrymen," said the hunter,&#xD;
with a sigh. " I would fain spare them, if pos-&#xD;
sible. Let nothing but the most urgent necessity&#xD;
induce us to use violence. Onalaska, you are a&#xD;
brave man, and can appreciate the feeling that&#xD;
impels me to spare a fellow-countryman."&#xD;
"I can," replied Red-Shoe, " and I will respect&#xD;
your wish. But if the safety of the White Rover&#xD;
required it, I would slay the great chief himself.&#xD;
Ay, the knife should find its way to his heart as&#xD;
easily as'-it passes into its sheath."&#xD;
"Is my white friend ready ?" he asked, after&#xD;
a pause.&#xD;
"He is ready ; lead on, chieftain, and Pierre&#xD;
Moran will follow if it be to death.&#xD;
" Good," said Red-Shoe, and the next instant&#xD;
he was moving towards the settlement like a&#xD;
phantom of darkness. Following the general'&#xD;
direction of what is no'w the Bayou road, they&#xD;
gradually approached St.-Ann street, which was&#xD;
to be the scene of their operations.&#xD;
With cautious and noiseless footsteps they&#xD;
passed many cabins whose inmates were sleep-&#xD;
ing. Once, soon after entering thetown, a dog&#xD;
came fortify and barked furiously, but fortunately&#xD;
the Thunder, which now reverberated through the&#xD;
skies, either stifled his vociferation, or the ele-&#xD;
mentary disturbance was referred to as the cause&#xD;
of his outcries, if they were heard by the towns-&#xD;
people. Pausing until he had wearied himself&#xD;
withthy. efforts to'attract attention, the chief and&#xD;
° oranglided on toward the prison. The dark-&#xD;
.ess was now intense, relieved only by occasional&#xD;
gleams s2f lightning.-&#xD;
1;dShoe paused when they reached St. Ann&#xD;
street. They stodd hear the structure contain-&#xD;
ingtthe object of their solicitude. The building&#xD;
used   a prison at that period did not much re-&#xD;
Asemble those bold and frowning edifices which&#xD;
are how' to be seen fronting Orleans and St. Ann&#xD;
treet. It was a low, stone building, containing&#xD;
but 4w'compartments. The cells for criminals&#xD;
the basement, and those for -debtors&#xD;
joytgether with a small suite of rooms for&#xD;
e turkey. The edifice was surrounded by a&#xD;
x l  ibont five feet high, :of stakes or piles,&#xD;
&#xD;
driven.into the earth, the projecting ends sharp-&#xD;
ened to a point to prevent it from being scaled'&#xD;
Outside of this yard or court, since the arrest&#xD;
of Henri, two sentinels had been placed, who&#xD;
were relieved from duty once in three hours.&#xD;
This additional precaution seemed to be war-&#xD;
ranted on account of the graveness of the offence,&#xD;
and the peculiar circumstances of the case ; for&#xD;
it was verily believed that the escape of the&#xD;
prisoner would be followed by the most serious&#xD;
consequences, possessing, as he evidently did,&#xD;
such unbounded influence over the Indians.&#xD;
Like others imprisoned for capital offences, he&#xD;
hadibeen placed in one of the basement cells, in&#xD;
that portion of the prison fronting upon Orleans&#xD;
street.&#xD;
The plan which Red-Shoe and Pierre Moran&#xD;
intended to'pursue, was to surprise the sentinels&#xD;
pon their post, secure them, awe them into si-&#xD;
lence, enter the prison, awaken the 'turnkey from&#xD;
his slumbers, corrupt him to lead the way to the&#xD;
prisoner's cell, free him from his irons, and then'&#xD;
depart as quickly as possible, seeking safety in&#xD;
the boundless forests of the Mississippi Valley.&#xD;
The moment of action had now come-a mo-&#xD;
ment requiring all the habitual cunning, coolness&#xD;
and courage of the Indian and backwoodsman.&#xD;
They stood within a few yards of- the prison;&#xD;
but no sounds were heard indicating that the&#xD;
sentinels were on duty. They waited patiently&#xD;
until the next flash of lightning 'should reveal&#xD;
the outlines of the prison and the surrounding&#xD;
palisade. The rain poured down intorrents. A&#xD;
heavy burst of thunder made the ground shake&#xD;
beneath them. The terrible, explosion was in-&#xD;
stantly followed by a red glare of electric flame,&#xD;
revealing every object neir them with fearful&#xD;
distinctness, and..in that lurid and momentary&#xD;
gleam, a portion of the person of a sentinel was&#xD;
seen'^standing, statue-like, in the sentry box.&#xD;
Awed by the  din of the warring elements, he&#xD;
had ceased to walk his' rounds; and his musket&#xD;
was resting against the wall beside.&#xD;
Passing to the other side of the prison, the&#xD;
second sentinel was found in the same condition,'&#xD;
though apparently somewhat more comatose, for&#xD;
it was the'last part of the watch.&#xD;
"Now," said Pierre Moran to Red-Shoe, in a&#xD;
whisper, "you secure one, and I will the other,&#xD;
and do'not shed blood if you can help it."&#xD;
"It is good,' replied the chief, ." and we will .&#xD;
see who shall effect his object with the utmost&#xD;
silence and despatch."&#xD;
With these words Red-Shoe glided baek td&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WHIT&#xD;
&#xD;
that side of the building looking towards Orleans&#xD;
street, where the first sentinel was posted, while&#xD;
Moran was left to deal with the other who did&#xD;
duty on St. Ann street.,&#xD;
The hunter divested himself of his hunting&#xD;
frock, and wrapping it about the breech of his&#xD;
rifle (which he had hitherto kept dry beneath it),&#xD;
laid both carefully upon the ground in the most&#xD;
sheltered spot he could conveniently find. His&#xD;
preparations were made with all requisite cau-&#xD;
tion, and when the deafening thunder warned&#xD;
him that the lightning was about to illumine the&#xD;
heavens, he remained motionless until the bright&#xD;
and blinding glare no longer rendered surround-&#xD;
ing objects visible. Pierre Moran with a few&#xD;
quick and noiseless steps reached the palisade,&#xD;
and stood within a few paces of the sentry box,&#xD;
which he did not wish to approach directly in&#xD;
front, but in a lateral direction, a proceeding&#xD;
which would greatly lessen the chances of dis-&#xD;
covery.&#xD;
With -stealthy step he moved on. His bold&#xD;
heart beat with unwonted quickness when he&#xD;
found himself standing but a single pace from&#xD;
the narrow building containing the unconscious&#xD;
soldier. . With a rapid and decided movement&#xD;
he threw himself forward, and quick as thought&#xD;
his powerfulhhand lay upon the sentinel's shoul-&#xD;
der. At the very instant of doing so, a tremen-&#xD;
dous peal of thunder broke with violence over&#xD;
their heads, and almost simultaneously with the&#xD;
deafening explosion, a sheet of flame blazed&#xD;
athwart the heavens,.and revealed to the aston-&#xD;
ished sentinel the stern and threatening face of&#xD;
Pierre Moran, and the blade of the suspended&#xD;
weapon. He made a convulsive effort to wrench&#xD;
the bayonet from h4 musket, but the tightening.&#xD;
grasp and deep tones of the hunter. struck terror&#xD;
to his already trembling heart and fear-palsied&#xD;
arm.&#xD;
"1Yield-be silent, and you are safe-resist,&#xD;
and you die !" exclaimed Moran.-&#xD;
Full of consternation, and astounded by the&#xD;
sudden and unexpected onset, the soldier was&#xD;
unable to speak, gud stood quaking in the ner-&#xD;
vous grasp of the hunter.&#xD;
"Do you hear and comprehend, man !" added&#xD;
the litter, shaking him, in order to restore in&#xD;
some measure his scattered senses.&#xD;
" Gather up your faculties and do as I bid you,&#xD;
'and no personal violence shall be offered you."&#xD;
By this time the sentinel began to understand&#xD;
his situation and what was.required of him, and&#xD;
suffered hishands to be bound without a mur&#xD;
&#xD;
EB ROVER.47&#xD;
mur. Pierre then emptied the priming from his&#xD;
musket, took off the bayonet, thrust it into his&#xD;
belt, and taking his prisoner by the shoulder, led&#xD;
him passively into Orleans,street. Pierre was&#xD;
not suffered to remain long in ignorance of the&#xD;
success of his comrade. He descried the dim&#xD;
outlines of two human figures, which proved to&#xD;
be Red-Shoe and the other sentinel,. who had&#xD;
been secured in the same manner, and .at the&#xD;
same time.&#xD;
" I have not forgotten your wish," said Ona-&#xD;
laska ; "no blood has been shed."&#xD;
" I feel that it is best thus," replied Pierre, and&#xD;
then added immediately, turning to the two pris-&#xD;
oners, "our object is to release Henri Del-&#xD;
croix, now under sentence of death. Do as we&#xD;
shall direct you, and you need be under no ap-&#xD;
prehensions, and shall suffer no bodily harm.&#xD;
To resist, you perceive, would be madness, and&#xD;
would result in no good, to you whatever. Now&#xD;
lead the way to the prisoner."&#xD;
The firm though suppressed tones of Moran,&#xD;
the presence of the tall Indian, whose grim and&#xD;
threatening visage was often revealed by con-&#xD;
stantly recurring flashes of lightning, all had&#xD;
their due effect upon the soldiers. Without a&#xD;
word they moved sullenly toward the prison.&#xD;
They paused at the gate of the prison yard.&#xD;
"How shall this gate be opened ?" asked Mo-&#xD;
ran, in a whisper, of the soldiers. There was no&#xD;
reply. Red-Shoe laid his hand suddenly upon&#xD;
his tomahawk, and drew it fromipbelt. The&#xD;
movement did not escape the antonA f the&#xD;
prisoners. An expression of fear passed over&#xD;
their faces, and with a shudder they drew nearer&#xD;
to the hunter.&#xD;
"Produce the key if you have it," added the&#xD;
latter, hurriedly. " There is no time to -lose.&#xD;
Do not hesitate, as you value your lives.&#xD;
By a singular piece of good fortune,, the key&#xD;
to the' gate was really in possession of one of the&#xD;
sentinels. In a moment it was in the:lock; and&#xD;
they passed into the court. The party now&#xD;
stood on the stone steps of the prison.&#xD;
" Ring the turnkey's bell furiously," added&#xD;
Pierre, to one of the soldiers'; " when he asks&#xD;
who rings, and what is wanted, tell him:your&#xD;
name, and thatiyou come with another prisoner&#xD;
by order of the governor. Your safety depends&#xD;
upon the manner in which you perform this&#xD;
service. If you use any artifice, if your voice&#xD;
shakes or betrays any anxiety, if you speak not&#xD;
promptly, I will not answer for the episegen-&#xD;
ces." And Moran looked signifiesudly ~t Zed-&#xD;

&#xD;
The soldier to whom the hunter had addressed&#xD;
himself;,'put forth his hand and- rang the turn-&#xD;
keyebelt violently, nor discontinued his efforts&#xD;
until-his voice was heard demanding the mean-&#xD;
Ing of such peremptory summons.&#xD;
i fIt is I, Corporal Rion. The governor has&#xD;
made an important arrest, and the prisoner is&#xD;
now at the door. Hurry yourself, my good fel-&#xD;

am wet to the skinI"&#xD;
"xeellent !" whispered the hunter. "You&#xD;
have done yourself credit. You shall lose noth-&#xD;
ing by it."&#xD;
Yefy soon the steps of the turnkey were heard,&#xD;
approaching. The features of Red-Shoe and,&#xD;
Pierre Moran lighted up with satisfaction. The&#xD;
kaygrated'in the lock and the door swung open.&#xD;
" AStep in quick," said Pierre, and he pushed&#xD;
the :soldiers forward over the threshold, and&#xD;
speedily followed them.&#xD;
"Here are two prisoners," said the turnkey.&#xD;
""es," said Moran, promptly, "and you to&#xD;
the number, makes three." As the hunter uttered&#xD;
these words, he laid his hand upon the jailor's&#xD;
arm, and Red-Shoe closed the door.&#xD;
"You're quite a joker," said the turnkey, withI&#xD;
.a laugh.&#xD;
" There is no joke about it, my fine fellow,"1&#xD;
replied- Pierre. "Look at these men a little&#xD;
closer , You perceive that they are soldiers-&#xD;
the very ones posted at your doors as sentinels.&#xD;
To be brief, we have come to set Henri Delcroix&#xD;
ati liberty. Lead the way to his cell without a&#xD;
manient's delay."t&#xD;
The jailorrecoiled in unspeakable amazement.&#xD;
He looked first at one, and then at another, and f&#xD;
his face grew ashy pale as his eyes rested upon&#xD;
the Indian ehief, who, standing erectland haugh- t&#xD;

and the proud chieftain made a significant mo- s&#xD;
tion towards his hatchet.                 i&#xD;
RhIjaildir hesitated no longer. Overwhelmed b&#xD;
with fears in regard to his own safety, he led a&#xD;
thaeway towards the cell. of the condemned as ti&#xD;
*.t g'1hisIhnbs could carry him. Urging the p&#xD;

b agallovomeents~of the keeperwhen he reached m&#xD;
thi40tfIhe prisoner's cell, but a fierce ges-&#xD;
&#xD;
,ture, and a threatening scowl from the chieftain&#xD;
quickened his motions and banished his irreso-&#xD;
lution.&#xD;
He applied the key and threw open the door&#xD;
with as much alacrity as his trepidation would&#xD;
permit. Henri was awakened from his uneasy&#xD;
slumbers by the creaking of the hinges and the&#xD;
sound of footsteps. He started from his recum-&#xD;
bent position, and cast his eyes with an inquir-&#xD;
ing expression toward the door. His vision&#xD;
rested upon Onalaska and Pierre Moran, and- a&#xD;
gleam of gladness and surprise passed over his&#xD;
pale visage.&#xD;
" What do I see ?" he exclaimed, arising to&#xD;
his feet, and stretching forth his manacled hands.&#xD;
" The White Rover sees his red brother and&#xD;
another friend," replied Red-Shoe, calmly.&#xD;
" And how and why have you come ?" contin-&#xD;
ued Henri, with increasing wonder.&#xD;
" We-have come," said Moran, "to set you at&#xD;
liberty. Jailer, knock off those disgraceful irons.&#xD;
They were never forged for the wrists of a man&#xD;
of honor."&#xD;
" I understand all," returned Henri, glancing&#xD;
at the two soldiers, bound and powerless. " You&#xD;
have risked your lives to save mine: I thank&#xD;
you from the profoundest depths of my heart;&#xD;
but I have committed no crime worthy of death;&#xD;
and I cannot fly like a criminal to save my life."&#xD;
"Nay, Henri Delcroix, you must not fall a&#xD;
victim to so nice .a sense of honor," replied the&#xD;
hunter, earnestly. " We have considered all.&#xD;
We know that there is hut one chance for you&#xD;
to vindicate your innocence, and re-establish&#xD;
your good name, and that one chance is in&#xD;
light."&#xD;
" I am resolved not to fly from my fate," re-&#xD;
urned Henri, firmly.&#xD;
" Would you die, young man, with such a&#xD;
burden of guilt upon your shoulders. Who will&#xD;
ake the trouble to establish your innocence after&#xD;
you have suffered the doom of a felon? Who&#xD;
will believe you innocent when the law has pro-&#xD;
nounced you guilty, and the word of justice has&#xD;
ealed the decision with blood. I ask and wait&#xD;
n vain for a response ; none is given, nor can&#xD;
e. The world will speak and think of you as&#xD;
traitor. But if 'you escape, and thus gain&#xD;
ime, your innocence can be fully and completely&#xD;
roved."&#xD;
"Pierre Moran, you argue well, perhaps just-&#xD;
y; you shake my resolution," rejoined Henri&#xD;
nuch wrought upon.&#xD;
"And there is yet another object thatrequires&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
your .thoughts-Helen Lerowe. Will she not&#xD;
weep when you are no more ? Will she not&#xD;
cease to be happy when you cease to live ?".&#xD;
"Mon Dieu! you move me 1" said Henri, with&#xD;
a sigh.&#xD;
" And think of the frantic grief of FatherDa-&#xD;
vion,' added Pierre.&#xD;
" And of the sorrow of the Soft-Voice," said&#xD;
Red-Shoe.&#xD;
Henri held forth his hands, and the jailor&#xD;
knocked off the irons.&#xD;
" You have conquered," he said, in a voice&#xD;
rendered unsteady by emotion. "Do with me&#xD;
as you will."&#xD;
"'Good," said Onalaska. " The friend of the&#xD;
red man shall be saved. The White Rover&#xD;
shall be seen again in the forest, and his rifle&#xD;
shall be heard upon its rivers and lakes."&#xD;
The chief took the lamp from the hand of the&#xD;
&#xD;
turnkey and passed out, together with Henri and&#xD;
Moran. The two soldiers and the jailor were&#xD;
left in the cell. Pierre turned the key upon&#xD;
them, and the three were prisoners.&#xD;
With rapid steps they hurried from the prison,&#xD;
locking the door after them, and the gate of the&#xD;
court precisely as they had found them. The&#xD;
violence of the storm had passed. The rain was&#xD;
still falling, but less plentifully. The thunder&#xD;
was heard with fainter veheinence, muttering&#xD;
afar off in the distance ; the lightning flashed&#xD;
at more lengthened intervals, and with dimin-&#xD;
ished brightness.&#xD;
Red-Shoe and Pierre Moran caught their rifles&#xD;
from the ground, and in a few moments they&#xD;
and the White Royer were lost in the depths of&#xD;
the forest, where they could safely laugh at the&#xD;
false claims of justice, and the weakness of prison&#xD;
bars.&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
A DISSEMBLER'S AVOWAL OF LOVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
THn morning succeeding the escape of Henri&#xD;
dawned clear and bright. The only traces of&#xD;
the -late storm were found in the wet gross&#xD;
and pools of water standing by the wayside.&#xD;
Since the condemnation of her lover, the-heart&#xD;
of Helen Lerowe had known no respite from&#xD;
sorrow; but being firm in the opinion that he&#xD;
was innocent, and that by some means he would&#xD;
be saved, she had struggled hard to temper&#xD;
down the violence of her grief to a calm and&#xD;
unconcerned demeanor; but this she found it&#xD;
hard to do, and so she let the storm of her first&#xD;
real grief pass in the solitude and silence of her&#xD;
own chamber. Feeling at length that the sym-&#xD;
pathy of one true heart would indeed be pre-&#xD;
cious, she resolved to visit Adelaide Ridelle,&#xD;
aid seek a momentary relief in the companion-&#xD;
ship of a nature so purely feminine and so&#xD;
gentle..&#xD;
Hastily putting'on her bonnet and shawl, she&#xD;
silently left the mansion of her guardian and&#xD;
took the way to St. Charles street. Her chagrin&#xD;
cannot well be described, when after walking a&#xD;
few yards she was joined by Captain Lesage.&#xD;
Helen's aversionr'for the man had-increased until&#xD;
it had grown to an absolute horror of his pres-&#xD;
one. Scarcely deigning to notice him she hur-&#xD;
rded forward,&#xD;
of=are abroad early, Mademoiselle Le-&#xD;
&#xD;
rowe," he said, with much suavity. "But you&#xD;
are doubtless desirous of breathing the air puri-&#xD;
fled by the shower of last night."&#xD;
" You are right, captain, and I desire to breathe&#xD;
it alone," replied Helen, with dignity.&#xD;
Lesage bit his lips, and was rather confused&#xD;
by this ho  thrust.&#xD;
"Nay, fair  aiden, such a thought were sel-&#xD;
fish. The air of heaven is designed for all to&#xD;
respire, and to me it is rendered purer and&#xD;
sweeter by the presence of Helen Lerowe."&#xD;
" Captain Lesage, such words from some men&#xD;
would please me, but when spoken by others&#xD;
they offend," returned Helen.&#xD;
" You are hard with me, Mademoiselle Le-&#xD;
rowe ; and I can perhaps conjecture why it is&#xD;
so," rejoined Lesage. " If in the discharge of&#xD;
my duty, I have been forced to witness against&#xD;
one whom I am informed you knew and es-&#xD;
teemed im 'childhood, I am rather to be pitied&#xD;
than condemned. I do assure you, mademoi-&#xD;
selle, that I have suffered not a little on account&#xD;
of this misguided young man."&#xD;
Here the captain paused and evinced much&#xD;
emotion.&#xD;
, " Gladly would I have saved him, and I have&#xD;
spent an'hour with the governor in earnest en-&#xD;
treaty that his life might be spared, but alas i&#xD;
his excellency is inexorable. He admired 'my&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WHITE ROVER.                 51&#xD;
&#xD;
generosity, but grew angry at my pertinacity.&#xD;
You can never know the agony I suffered when&#xD;
I stood up to testify against Delcroix. And&#xD;
why did I suffer? Because I knew that he was:&#xD;
esteemed by Helen Lerowe. Believe me, .if&#xD;
there is aught I can do to mitigate the fate of&#xD;
this young man it shall be gladly done. All the&#xD;
return that I ask is, that I may be placed in the&#xD;
list of your friends-thought of with kindness,&#xD;
and ultimately with pleasure. Am I overween-&#xD;
ing, mademoiselle? Do I ask too much ? Do&#xD;
I overstep the bounds of decorum ?"&#xD;
As Lesage went on, his voice grew soft, sub-'&#xD;
dued, and humbly respectful.&#xD;
"Is it possible that I have judged this man&#xD;
wrongfully ?" thought Helen. .-&#xD;
"1Mademoiselle Lerowe," resumed the captain,&#xD;
"I beg of you when this. unhappy tragedy has&#xD;
been enacted to the end, and the grave has closed&#xD;
over that misguided youth, whose thoughtless-&#xD;
ness has well-nigh baptized this colony in blood,&#xD;
to think less harshly of one who would willingly&#xD;
have spared the offender at the 'risk of every-&#xD;
thing, in order to save you a single tear, or a&#xD;
sigh of sorrow. Were it not for this unhappy&#xD;
affair, I would even now venture to report&#xD;
the story . of my unrequited love.  But I&#xD;
may not tell the tale. My motives would be&#xD;
doubted, my actions misconstrued, and my in-&#xD;
tegrity called in question. But were Henri Del-&#xD;
eroix at large, and unsuspected oferime, I would&#xD;
upon bended knee tell you such a story of un-&#xD;
changing, fathomless love as living woman never&#xD;
heard. The history of my passion must remain&#xD;
untold.  I can only think -of your supernal&#xD;
beauty, and dream of your angelic goodness;&#xD;
all I may ask is your pity, a small boon for&#xD;
Helen Lerowe to accord to a hopeless man."&#xD;
With low and solemn earnestness of tone, the&#xD;
consummate dissembler breathed 'forth these&#xD;
honeyed words.&#xD;
,«Captain Lesage," replied Helen, seriously,&#xD;
" your presence is not agreeable to me. I know&#xD;
not well why it is, but your words are to me&#xD;
like the hissing of a serpent. My soul turns&#xD;
instinctively from you with loathing and fear.&#xD;
Your looks are sorrowful, and your speech sub-&#xD;
dued and grief-like, but you fail to touch my&#xD;
heart. It seems to me (God knows whom I wrong&#xD;
and whom I do not) that when the sacrifice of my&#xD;
foster brother shall have been consummated,&#xD;
the Judge of all human hearts will require his&#xD;
blood-at your hands. Go, Captain Lesage, and&#xD;
when you have made your peace with Heaven,&#xD;
&#xD;
will be the proper time to speak of earthly mat-&#xD;
ters. My spirit is too sorrowful now to brook-&#xD;
patiently the presence of the man who- has been&#xD;
an active agent in the conviction of my foster--&#xD;
brother.. I wish you a good morning."&#xD;
" To your sorrow, then," replied Lesage, bow-&#xD;
ing deferentially, " will I attribute your unkind-&#xD;
ness to one who would sell his best blood to&#xD;
serve you, and think the sacrifice a pleasure.&#xD;
Heaven sustain and keep you, mademoiselle."&#xD;
With another bow, humbly respectful,' sad&#xD;
apparently, and grieved, the captain-left Helen&#xD;
to pursue her way. to the St. Charles.&#xD;
" Be of good courage," said Madame Ridelle,&#xD;
as our heroine entered the house. " I feel within&#xD;
me a good assurance that an all-wise Providence&#xD;
.will yet intetpose to prevent this sacrifice.&#xD;
" Weep not, faint not, despair not, cease not to&#xD;
trust in Him who dispenses life and death, pun-&#xD;
ishes the guilty and rewards the righteous."&#xD;
" I will struggle hard to do so," replied Helen,&#xD;
weeping. "Do not reproach me, nor deem it&#xD;
unmaidenly to shed a few tears for the 'fate of&#xD;
my foster-brother-one so good, so loyal, and&#xD;
yet so basely maligned."&#xD;
"My poor child," said a gentle ,voice, which&#xD;
proved to be that of Madame Mablois, to whom&#xD;
the reader's attention has before' been called.&#xD;
"Let the noble consciousness that Henri Del-&#xD;
croix is innocent, impart fortitude to your soul,&#xD;
and uphold your sinking spirit."&#xD;
Helen turned towards the speaker with an&#xD;
expression of the liveliest satisfaction.&#xD;
" Are you here, good mother I" she exclaimed,&#xD;
embracing her warmly. "I am indeed glad to&#xD;
see you in this hour of sorrow. Appropriately&#xD;
have the red men of the forest named you Soft-&#xD;
Voice. When you speak so gently and hope-&#xD;
fully of Henri, your tones are indeed musical&#xD;
and soft."&#xD;
"There are," said Mablois, in a suppressed yet&#xD;
earnest voice, " active agents at work for the lib'&#xD;
eration of Henri, and they will succeed at what-&#xD;
ever hazard. Even now," she added, propfieti.,&#xD;
tally, " he may be at liberty."&#xD;
"Speak on, 'Madame Mablois. Your words&#xD;
fall like healing dews .upon my heart !".cried&#xD;
Helen. And then she added in-a more serious,&#xD;
tone, " Yet it is not well to foster false hopes-&#xD;
it would but entail more, bitter woe at last."&#xD;
"Pierre Moran," said Adelaide, appeariug..at&#xD;
that moment, "knows much ; he assures. mej of&#xD;
the wickedness of Lesage."&#xD;

&#xD;
"And Piere Moran speaks the truth," added&#xD;
Mabloiia&#xD;
"He told me upon the night on which the&#xD;
wrraflt *as issued for his arrest," continued&#xD;
Adelaide, with a blush, "that the captain had&#xD;
laid more than one plan for th destruction of&#xD;
Deicroix."&#xD;
"And the troth of the case is that Pierre is&#xD;
too deeply-in the captain's confidence to be safe,"&#xD;
added Madame Ridelle. - " It was on this ac-&#xD;
countfhat Lesage thought it- best to have him&#xD;
imprisoned so that he could not testify at the&#xD;
trial of Henri."&#xD;
"I perceive that you do not yet know all,"&#xD;
saidMadame Mablois. " The captain has em-&#xD;

" My dear guardian! my good, kind friend,&#xD;
do not say -so !" exclainied Helen, earnestly.-&#xD;
" He is not guilty'of the crime for which he hat&#xD;
been unjustly condemned."&#xD;
"Do you accuse me of injustice, Helen ?"&#xD;
said the governor, sadly.&#xD;
"Pardon me, my best and most generous&#xD;
friend and benefactor; but if your conscience&#xD;
has not already told you that you have acted&#xD;
with too much precipitancy, far be it from the&#xD;
child of your bounty to be your accuser," an-&#xD;
swered Helen.&#xD;
" You take an ingenious way to accuse, Helen,"&#xD;
rejoined de Bienville, mildly. "I have no mal-&#xD;
ice against that young man. I have done-with&#xD;
extreme reluctance-what nave thought my&#xD;
duty. I grant that he appears truly noble and.&#xD;
innocent; but facts are fearfully against him.,&#xD;
I would that there had been some pretext for&#xD;
sparing him, for he impressed us all in his favor..&#xD;
But the plot was truly a horrible one."&#xD;
"It fills my heart with pleasure to hear you&#xD;
speak thus in favor of the unhappy Henri. Lis-&#xD;
ten still further to the dictates of your better&#xD;
judgment, and save him. Believe me," continued&#xD;
Helen, with increasing earnestness, "he is inno-&#xD;
cent of the crime charged upon hir. Lesage&#xD;
has perjured himself. He has before attempted,&#xD;
the life of Henri; but fortunately he failed."&#xD;
" Can you prove what you affirm ?" asked the-&#xD;
governor, eagerly.&#xD;
"I could, if Pierre Moran could be found,""&#xD;
answered Helen, quickly.&#xD;
"Pierre Moran," said de Bienville, thought-&#xD;
tully. " I know him; a dark, sinister-looking&#xD;
man, but possessed of a fearless heart, and I be-&#xD;
lieve him honorable. I mu st'sift this matter to&#xD;
the bottom. But it is dif eult to believe, fort a&#xD;
morient, that a man so smoothly. spoken, and&#xD;
apparently so candid and forgiving withal, can&#xD;
be  guilty of what yout accuse him. If it should&#xD;
prove so, woe be to him."&#xD;
De Bienville spoke the last few words in that&#xD;
firm and deep toned voice which characterized.&#xD;
him in nioinehts of excitement, and indicated a&#xD;
fixed and unchanging purpose..&#xD;
Helen sank upon her knees, held the govern-&#xD;
or's hands in her white and tumbling inger,&#xD;
and shed gaateful tears upon there.&#xD;
"What is this young man to you?" asked d6+&#xD;
Bienrilie, sorrowfully.&#xD;
"If you have fathomed my secret, be still ih-&#xD;
erorts, 2ny bertefactor," replied lielet. "&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
me not unmaidenly. Deal not too sternly with&#xD;
your poor girl."&#xD;
" God forbid, Helen, that I should deal sternly&#xD;
with you," returned de Bienville, with emotion.&#xD;
"It is not in my heart. I could'not be stern&#xD;
with you if I would. Cease to weep, child ;&#xD;
your tears tove me."&#xD;
" Then will I continue to weep !" cried Helen.&#xD;
"Nay, my girl, arise. I will investigate this&#xD;
matter more deeply ; for I tell you in confidence&#xD;
I wish to save this man. He' interests me in&#xD;

titude and courage he bore his fate. ,But where&#xD;
is this Pierre Moran?  Can epbe found ?"&#xD;
" An order was issued for his arrest, and he&#xD;
fled for safety to the forest."&#xD;
"Ah, yes, I remember about the warrant."&#xD;
"It was a part of the policy of Lesage that he&#xD;
should not testify at the trial of Henri," added&#xD;
Helen.&#xD;
"And why not ?" asked the governor.&#xD;
"For the very good reason, as I have just&#xD;
learned, that Captain I4esage had offered him&#xD;
two hundred pounds to take the life of Henri."&#xD;
"Helen, are you sure that there is no mistake&#xD;
about this " asked de 1ienville, with solemn&#xD;
earnestness.&#xD;
" I feel very sure that I have not been misin-&#xD;
formed.. And this is not all; I heard that he is&#xD;
even now plotting with some of your enemies to&#xD;
have you recalled to France."&#xD;
"My dear Helen, you astonish me beyond ex-&#xD;
pression: I must attend to this. I feel that you&#xD;
are not altogether wrong," rejoined the governor,&#xD;
hurriedly, and considerably excited.&#xD;
Helen kissed the governor's hand, and arose&#xD;
from her knees with her face glowing with new&#xD;
hope.&#xD;
De Bienville gently put back the dark masses&#xD;
of her dishevelled hair, -gazed earnestly and ten-&#xD;
derly into her face, and then bending forward,&#xD;
gravely kissed her fair brow.&#xD;
Helen inclined her head and received the salute&#xD;
Y gracefully.&#xD;
" Go, my child, and by the help of Heaven, I&#xD;
will do my duty by you," he said, in an agitated&#xD;
voice. " I know not why my heart turns to-&#xD;
wards you with an affection so pure, so deep&#xD;
and fatherly, but I know it is thus."&#xD;
While the governor was speaking, a messen-&#xD;
&#xD;
53&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
ger rushed into the apartment with breathless&#xD;
haste, dispensing with all the forms of etiquette.&#xD;
" I come to inform your excellency," he cried,&#xD;
in hot haste, " that Henri Delcroix has escaped.&#xD;
The two sentinels, and the jailer, were found&#xD;
this morning locked into the cell which he had&#xD;
occupied. Captain Lesage is almost frantic with&#xD;
fury, and has despatched men in every direction'&#xD;
to find the prisoner; but everybody that has&#xD;
heard of the escape says it will be of no use,&#xD;
because long before this time he is in the depths&#xD;
of the forest, and surrounded by a thousand'&#xD;
warriors."&#xD;
With a cry of joy Helen sank fainting upon&#xD;
the floor.&#xD;
"I thank you for your promptness in bringing&#xD;
me the important news," said the governor. "I&#xD;
will attend to it."&#xD;
Waving his hand for the messenger to go, do&#xD;
Bienville raised his ward in his arms and placed&#xD;
her in an easy chair, and in a few moments she&#xD;
recovered.&#xD;
"Escaped !" she cried, with a smile of joy.&#xD;
"Escaped ! gone ! safe ! Heaven be praised!"&#xD;
" One thing you have forgotten," said the&#xD;
governor. " His escape and flight proves his&#xD;
guilt."&#xD;
"By no means. It seems to me the only way&#xD;
to establish his innocence  for no man can&#xD;
prove his own innocence after his death," re-&#xD;
turned Helen.&#xD;
"A very ingenious argument," answered do&#xD;
Bienville, with a smile. And then he added&#xD;
immediately in a low voice, "Were it not trea-&#xD;
son to my king and country, I would say-on&#xD;
your account-I am not sorry that he has thus&#xD;
escaped."&#xD;
"Ever kind, ever indulgent, ever generous,"&#xD;
replied Helen. "You overwhelm me with good.&#xD;
ness, you fill me with admiration."&#xD;
Saying these words our heroine retired to her&#xD;
chamber, with her heart lightened of its burden&#xD;
of sorrow. Providence had indeed interposed=&#xD;
its saving hand to shield the innocent.&#xD;
The light steps of Helen had scarcely ceased&#xD;
to be heard, when the tall and majestic figure of,&#xD;
the princess, La Glorieuse, swept unannouncede&#xD;
into the apartment. Unabashed and self-pos-&#xD;
sessed, she paused before the governor.&#xD;
".Great chief," she said, calmly anid distinctly,&#xD;
and in good French, "I have come to bibng'thi&#xD;

La Gorieuse had given him, and read as follows:&#xD;
"GotBaNOR DE'BIENVILLE :&#xD;
"Though doomed to a felon's death, and&#xD;
forced-to fly from my own people for safety, I&#xD;

"I do not reproach your excellency for the part&#xD;

conscientiously, and-according to the dictates of&#xD;
your best judgment, and I even read sympathy&#xD;
fov ,mein your earnest eyes. I forgive you freely,&#xD;
and with real sincerity, though deeply regretting&#xD;
that a Iofty and honorable miad should be de-&#xD;
coived by a perjured villain. My conscience,&#xD;
Governor de Bienville, almost accuses me of&#xD;
injustice to the friendly though savage people&#xD;
whom I am among, 'or what I am about to tell&#xD;
young his is a hard and cruel heart indeed&#xD;
who would not sacrifice something to save his&#xD;
countrymen from destruction.&#xD;
,Allow me to respectfully urge upon you the&#xD;
p opriety, and necessity even, of sending more&#xD;
men to Natchez: That part of the French colo-&#xD;

this cloud of destruction hovering over Louisi-&#xD;
ana. Heaven knows how earnestly I hope that&#xD;
my efforts may be crowned with success.&#xD;
"Sorvidal is stationed among the Chickasaws,&#xD;
ostensibly as an agent, but. really as a spy. He&#xD;
had better be recalled. The Indians have fath-&#xD;
omed his purpose, and he is not safe a single&#xD;
hour. I shall advise him to leave when I see&#xD;
him. He can effect nothing by staying among&#xD;
them, for they are too shrewd to admit him to&#xD;
their councils or confidence. If the destruction'&#xD;
of the colony can be averted in no other way, I&#xD;
shall endeavor to produce hostilities between the&#xD;
Chickasaws and Choctaws, and thus turn the&#xD;
tide of battle in that direction. If it be true that&#xD;
you have a secret and even active agent or spy,&#xD;
who is unceasingly hovering with silence and&#xD;
secresy among the various Indian tribes, he will&#xD;
assure you that I have spoken truly, and advised&#xD;
you for the best, as time will prove.&#xD;
"If the tongue of rumor speaks not falsely,&#xD;
there is one in your employ whose mysterious&#xD;
movements, whose fittings from place to place,&#xD;
almost entitle him to the faculty of ubiquity.&#xD;
Seek his counsel, and learn whether H'enri Del-&#xD;
croix is a friend to his people. I send this&#xD;
'speaking bark' by the hand of one whom you&#xD;
know, the proud daughter of the Sun, who is my&#xD;
friend, and a friend of peace. BeggingPas a favor&#xD;
that you will assure your ward-my foster-sister&#xD;
-that I am in safety, I remain your humble&#xD;
servant.              HENRI DELCnOIX."&#xD;
The surprise of de Bienville upon the perusal&#xD;
of this missive was extreme. If he had previously&#xD;
felt any misgivings in regard to the honesty of&#xD;
Lesage, they were now increased, while his in-&#xD;
terest in Henri grew in proportion as his doubts&#xD;
of the captain's honesty increased.&#xD;
" Daughter of the Sun," said de Bienville,&#xD;
turning to the princess, " do the Natchez desire&#xD;
peace, or are they preparing for war ?"'&#xD;
" My people love peace, if it can be had on&#xD;
honorable terms," replied La Glorieuse.&#xD;
" They shall have them," answered, the gov-&#xD;
ernor. " You may tell the Great Sun, that the&#xD;
French chief will do them justice. If they have&#xD;
bean wronged they shall be righted. Since Ihave&#xD;
exercised authority in the colony I have been&#xD;
friendly to the Natchez."&#xD;
"The words of the wise chief shallbe repeated&#xD;
Sto the Great Sun," replied the princess. K&#xD;

"It is near sunset; let us-go beforeoyou return&#xD;

eare you going, ;girls ?" asked Ma-&#xD;
u a Ridelle, when she saw Helenand Adelaide&#xD;
#e house.&#xD;
sp $bpn mu  ae  replied Adelaide, gaily.&#xD;
Wrsse on " returned Madame, Ridelle;&#xD;
;.ca'g atpp ; mother; it is wicked.torplay&#xD;
upon words,"replied the daughter.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, do'not go far, or you will be running&#xD;
into danger. Several Indians have been seen&#xD;
hovering about the outskirts of the town lately.&#xD;
Do not go out of sight of the house, for we have&#xD;
had sorrow enough, recently, and if' anything&#xD;
shouldhappen to you and Mademoiselle Helen,&#xD;
it would quite unnerve me," returned Madame&#xD;
Ridelle, with true-motherly earnestness.&#xD;
" We will be very cautious, dear mother,"&#xD;
answered Adelaide, and then Helen walked&#xD;
slowly away towards what is now known as St.&#xD;
James's street ; a spot which was then covered&#xD;
by a heavy growth.&#xD;
As Helen moved on, enlivened by the conver-&#xD;
sation of her companion, she felt her spirits re-&#xD;
viving, and the mental depression which she had&#xD;
felt for the last half hour, leaving her. The&#xD;
sun was setting when they reached the cypress'&#xD;
named in the note. Its burning disc glowed fiery&#xD;
red as it sank gently and almost imperceptibly&#xD;
in the, far-off west. Its departing beams fell&#xD;
with undimmed splendor upon the cypress&#xD;
boughs over the heads of the young girls.I&#xD;
"Let us 'sit down, mademoiselle, upon this&#xD;
mossy knoll," said Adelaide.&#xD;
The fair mesdemoiselle sat side by side. Soft&#xD;
and fragrant breezes fanned their brows, and set&#xD;
the green leaves in motion. The continuous&#xD;
roar of the rolling waters of the Mississippi,;&#xD;
modulated to a dreamy and pleasant monotony,&#xD;
was borne to their ears.' Birds sang gaily from&#xD;
the pendant branches.&#xD;
" Am I not a prophetess, mademoiselle ? Did&#xD;
I not assure you that the sun would set glori-&#xD;
ously, to-night ?" §aid Adelaide, enthusiastically.&#xD;
"It is indeed a calm and lovely hour. The&#xD;
ruddy glow of the setting sun, the gentle sighing&#xD;
of the scented winds, the sweet song of the untir-&#xD;
ing birds, together with the agreeable' murmur'&#xD;
of the Golden -River, has -a bewildering charm&#xD;
for me," replied Helen, earnestly. " To me there&#xD;
is sweetest music in the voices of'-nature'; they&#xD;
have power to attune my spirit to responsive&#xD;
harmony. I would that my life could pass on&#xD;
in an even current, amid scenes and sounds like'&#xD;
these, far away in the dense green wood. 'It,&#xD;
seems to me that one might grow better, if not&#xD;
wiser, and more fit for the world to come.. To&#xD;
commune with nature is to cultivate an agree-&#xD;
ment with all terrestrial things. No really bad,&#xD;
men, 1 am inclined to believe, have ever been&#xD;
true lovers of nature."'.&#xD;
"I agree with you," said Adelaide. "I ha&#xD;
often had such thoughts, but Ihave not often&#xD;
&#xD;
the companionship of a friend to whom I could&#xD;
express them. Look ! the sunbeams are getting&#xD;
lower upon the cypress; they already fall upon&#xD;
the trunk, and will soon be to the ground. It is,&#xD;
nearly time for Henri to be here."&#xD;
of Why did you not say Pierre Moran, instead&#xD;
of Henri?" replied Helen.&#xD;
"Because I seldom speak of him," said Ade-&#xD;
laide.&#xD;
't"I do not wonder that the red men love the&#xD;
forest," continued Helen. " It would indeed be&#xD;
singular if they, did not. Born in the forest,&#xD;
reared in the forest, they know no fitting home&#xD;
- save that."&#xD;
Helen paused.&#xD;
"I thought I heard a sound," she added.&#xD;
"It was but the echo of your own voice," said&#xD;
her companion.&#xD;
"There is something noble in an Indian. He&#xD;
is true to his instincts, and true to his friends,"&#xD;
resumed Helen.&#xD;
"Hark!" interrupted Adelaide. "I am quite&#xD;
certain I heard footsteps."&#xD;
" It is near the hour," replied Helen. "The&#xD;
sun's disc is now hidden by those distant ranges&#xD;
of hills. It is the transition hour-ethe birth of&#xD;
twilight."&#xD;
Adelaide -uttered a piercing shriek, as at that&#xD;
instant the dark, tall figures of two Indians stood&#xD;
beside them- Adelaide continued to send forth&#xD;
shriek after shriek ; but Helen Lerowe was&#xD;
speechless with terror. One of the savages laid&#xD;
his tawny hand upon Adelaide's arm, and mo-&#xD;
tioned her to silence.&#xD;
" White squaws go with us," he said, in indif.&#xD;
ferent French.&#xD;
"No ! no ! we cannot !" cried Adelaide, in an&#xD;
agony of terror, attempting at the same time to&#xD;
free herself from her captor. But the powerful&#xD;
hand that was upon her held her fair, round&#xD;
arm as though it had been a feeble infant's.&#xD;
" Must go with us-mount fine horse-ride a&#xD;
great way-cross rivers and valleys-find anoth-&#xD;
er country, full of great prairies, where the sun&#xD;
. shines always-where are many fine lakes-&#xD;
where game is plenty."&#xD;
While the savage was speaking, two more ap-&#xD;
peared, leading horses. He who had spoken,&#xD;
lifted Helen in his arms and placed her upon&#xD;
one of the-animals, and the other performed the&#xD;
same service for Adelaide.&#xD;
The former, who had somewhat recovered her&#xD;
presence of mind, now besought their captors in&#xD;
the most moving'terms to suffer them to return&#xD;
&#xD;
home in safety ; but she might have spared her&#xD;
eloquence, for, her words fell upon ears seldom&#xD;
moved to pity by touching appeals.&#xD;
With emotions which no pen can describe, she&#xD;
saw the red sons of the forest mount their horses.&#xD;
One took the steed upon which she had been&#xD;
placed, by the bridle, another rode up to her side&#xD;
to keep her steady in her seat, and to prevent&#xD;
her from attempting to escape ; two more as-&#xD;
sumed the same position in relation to Adelaide,&#xD;
and in this order they struck into the forest,&#xD;
slowly ate first, but increasing their speed as the&#xD;
fair captives became inured to the motions. of&#xD;
the horses.&#xD;
Adelaide still continuing to utter piercing&#xD;
cries, the savage who rode by her side sternly&#xD;
bade her'be quiet, and pointed significantly to&#xD;
his scalping-knife. The poor girl shuddered,&#xD;
and her fears were still more keenly excited.&#xD;
Knowing that her outcries arose unheard by&#xD;
those who.would gladly assist them, Helen en-&#xD;
treated her to be silent (since resistance was&#xD;
useless), and submit passively to her fate,&#xD;
" God," she added, " is able to protect us in&#xD;
-all places. Our friends will surely attempt our'&#xD;
rescue."&#xD;
Although our heroine struggled to comfort&#xD;
her companion and hide her own fears, her sufr,&#xD;
ferings were not the less intense. ,She beheld&#xD;
before her a long and tedious journey, and all&#xD;
the horrors of captivity 5 and finally, doubtless,&#xD;
a death of whose agonies she shuddered to think.&#xD;
She perceived at a glance, that their captors'did&#xD;
not belong to any of the neighboring tribes, and&#xD;
she was not long in concluding that they were&#xD;
Camanches, a nation of whose prowess she had&#xD;
heard much. They were as numerous as the&#xD;
leaves of the forest, and bold and warlike in&#xD;
their habits. She had, on many occasions, heard&#xD;
the governor and St. Dennis talk of their daring&#xD;
exploits, and of their cruelties ; but little did she&#xD;
dream  at that time of ever falling into thelf&#xD;
hands. She felt assured (providing they were&#xD;
really Camanches) that they would cross the&#xD;
Mississippi before morning, and then pursue&#xD;
their journey in a north-western direction.&#xD;
Helen was correct in her conjectures. After&#xD;
going forward ,about an hour, they halted oi&#xD;
the banks of the river. The horses were taken&#xD;
over in a flat-boat, and they passed over in a&#xD;
canoe. " It is singular," said Helen, "that they&#xD;
shpuld have a flat-boat. It is not the kind of&#xD;
craft they make use of, and they manage it rather&#xD;
awkwai-dly."&#xD;

"It is one they have stolen from our people,&#xD;
ly," 'replied Adelaide. " They steal horses,&#xD;
ii hy should'theynot appropriate other things&#xD;
opilonging to them, to their own use ?"&#xD;
After we re-commence our journey upon the&#xD;
'hprside,' added Helen, in a whisper, while&#xD;
were crossing.the river, " endeavor by every&#xD;
lnj xiious expedient tq leave some indications&#xD;

'And while Pierre is upon the trail, Adelaide,&#xD;

} 01u enough! !Ah, they will' both follow&#xD;

" y; father, too, is, skilled in wood craft. His&#xD;
wounds are healed, and he will never remain&#xD;

no thohgt of ?how will Pierre Moran and&#xD;
en i Delcroix learn our sad story ?"&#xD;
1         -'&#xD;
&#xD;
" By some means, assuredly," answered Helen,&#xD;
with a sigh.&#xD;
" Ah, you sigh, my dear mademoiselle ; you&#xD;
see that it is impossible that either of them&#xD;
should learn anything in relation to our fate.&#xD;
We shall perish in the wilderness ;" and Ade-&#xD;
laide wept afresh.&#xD;
"Exercise more fortitude, my companion in&#xD;
affliction," said Helen, mildly. " Do not despair.&#xD;
Whatever our sufferings may be, let us remem-&#xD;
ber that, repinings or self-reproaches will not&#xD;
avail us anything. Patience, fortitude, courage,&#xD;
and watchfulness are the qualities that we are&#xD;
called upon to exercise, and the only traits of&#xD;
character worthy of us at present, or that can&#xD;
serve us in this emergency. Set the example&#xD;
for me, Adelaide. Let me see how strong your&#xD;
heart is ; how much noble heroism you possess,"&#xD;
"Dear Helen !" exclaimed Adelaide, "that&#xD;
noble heroism which you speak of, you display&#xD;
in your own character. Your gentle admoni-&#xD;
tions bring me to my senses. It -was myself&#xD;
that was the author of your misfortunes, and yet&#xD;
I am the first to repine. Forgive me, my friend,&#xD;
and in future I will strive to emulate your heroic&#xD;
conduct.".&#xD;
In a short time the river was safely passed.&#xD;
The captives were again placed upon the horses,&#xD;
and the whole patty moved on in the same order&#xD;
as before, in a north-western direction, as Helen&#xD;
had anticipated; but they went forward at much&#xD;
greater speed.&#xD;
It was a long and dreadful night to the cap-&#xD;
[tves. Though reared in a new country, they&#xD;
had never been subject to hardship, yet often in&#xD;
peril. Their powers of endurance were tested&#xD;
to the utmost., . They were forced to ride through&#xD;
a tract of country still encumbered with its pri&#xD;
meval forests, sometimes lying in gentle swells,&#xD;
often broken and rugged, and cut up by small&#xD;
streams, traversed by lonely valleys, and not&#xD;
unfrequently rendered pleasant'by an unclouded&#xD;
moon, and before morning the fair captives were&#xD;
far from New Orleans. Leaving them to pursue&#xD;
their dreary way through the trackless wilder-&#xD;
ness, we will now turn our attention to other&#xD;
characters.&#xD;

CHAVgER Xiii.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SECRET AGENT-THE DISCOVERY.&#xD;
&#xD;
AT the time of the abduction of Mesdemoiselle&#xD;
Helen and Adelaide, de Bienville was sitting in&#xD;
his study in earnest conversation with a person-&#xD;
age whom we have not yet introduced to the&#xD;
reader, and who is worthy of some description.&#xD;
He was a man just in the prime of life, and&#xD;
rather above the medium, .size. His features&#xD;
were regular, and somewhat stern in their ex-&#xD;
pression; the eyes dark, deep-set and piercing ;&#xD;
the forehead high, and the perceptive faculties&#xD;
strongly marked. The formation of the mouth&#xD;
expressed much determination of character and&#xD;
firmness of purpose. 1e was obviously a man&#xD;
who had seen much of I fe, and one who would&#xD;
not shrink from danger  hen convinced that he&#xD;
was pursuing the path o duty.&#xD;
" Boisbriant," said the governor, "I am glad&#xD;
to' see you. I have been much perplexed since&#xD;
your absence, and now  erhaps you can advise&#xD;
me how to act. What othis Indian alliance ?"&#xD;
" Since I saw you," eplied Boisbriant, "I&#xD;
have passed through the territories of the most&#xD;
powerful and most to b dreaded tribes of Indi-&#xD;
ans. No matter what di guise I have assumed,&#xD;
or how I have obtained ny information, or how&#xD;
many hair-breadth escapes I have had, suffice it&#xD;
that I have learned about this 'dangerous move-&#xD;
ment among the red men. There is danger be-&#xD;
fore ui. The French colony is threatened with&#xD;
destruction."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Can you inform me who is the leader of this&#xD;
hostile demonstration ?" asked 'de. .Bienville,&#xD;
earnestly.&#xD;
" Onalaska-nost commonly called Red-Shoe&#xD;
-the Chickasaw chief," answered Boisbriant,&#xD;
promptly.&#xD;
"Do-you know whether the slaves have really&#xD;
joined in this movement, or more, properly,&#xD;
whether they intend to rise against their masters&#xD;
when the Indians attack the different settle-&#xD;
ments ?"&#xD;
'" That is truly their intention, your excellen-&#xD;
cy," replied Boisbriant.&#xD;
" Will you do me the favor to read this," said,&#xD;
the governor,.taking the scroll of birchen bark&#xD;
from the desk, which Henri had sent by La&#xD;
Glorieuse.&#xD;
Boisbriant read the missive with great appar-&#xD;
ent interest.&#xD;
" Should you say that the writer of those lines&#xD;
speaks the truth ?" asked delBienville, anxiously.&#xD;
"Most undoubtedly. With me the name of&#xD;
the writer would be a sufficient guarantee ,of the&#xD;
entire truthfulness of every word," returned Bois-&#xD;
briant, without hesitation.&#xD;
" You have doubtless heard of the young man's&#xD;
arrest, imprisonment, trial, condemnation, &amp;amp;. ?"&#xD;
continued his excellency.&#xD;
" I have," said Boisbriant, drily.&#xD;

THE WHIT&#xD;
&#xD;
His good wife did not oppose his design; and&#xD;
so Ridelle took his rifle and left the house, fol-&#xD;
lowing the course which she had indicated as&#xD;
having been taken by tl-e young girls.&#xD;
After he had been gone a short time, Madame&#xD;
Ridelle opened the door and looked anxiously&#xD;
out, in the hope of seeing the object of her so-&#xD;
licitude approaching. But she saw nothing save&#xD;
the clear blue sky, and the dim outlines of the&#xD;
surrounding forest. When she had gazed long&#xD;
and attentively, she was in the act of closing the&#xD;
door, when she perceived a folded paper lying&#xD;
near the threshold. .She stooped and secured&#xD;
it, and 'impelled by a pardonable curiosity,&#xD;
opened and read its contents.&#xD;
It was the note which Helen had received&#xD;
from Henri. The fears of Madame Ridelle sub-&#xD;
sided.&#xD;
" If the girls are with Henri and Pierre, they&#xD;
are safe," she said to herself.&#xD;
After the lapse of half an-hour, Louis Ridelle&#xD;
returned alone. His wife immediately showed&#xD;
him the note, remarking as she did so, that she'&#xD;
&#xD;
presumed they were in no great danger.&#xD;
"So it would seem," replied Louis, with a&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
Another half hour passed. Both Ridelle and&#xD;
his wife arose often and went to the door; but&#xD;
the same blue expanse met their gaze, the same&#xD;
dark outline of forest.&#xD;
"This suspense is growing painful to me !"&#xD;
exclaimed Ridelle, at length. " Something has&#xD;
happened to the girls. Adelaide was never ab-&#xD;
sent at this late hour before. I will walk to the&#xD;
spot indicated in the note."&#xD;
"I think you had better, Louis, for I don't&#xD;
.feel right," replied his spouse, in a tone betraying&#xD;
much anxiety.&#xD;
Ridelle took his rifle and left the house with&#xD;
more haste than before. With a foreboding&#xD;
sense of some new misfortune, he walked rapidly&#xD;
towards the cypress grove, and soon stood within,&#xD;
the sombre shade of the identical tree where the&#xD;
fair mesdemoiselle had sat and watched the set-&#xD;
ting sun.&#xD;
He called upon the names of Adelaide and&#xD;
Helen, softly at first, and then more loudly.. But&#xD;
the sweet voices of the maidens gave baek no&#xD;
response.. The loved names were only repeated&#xD;
in mocking echoes. Riddle walked along the&#xD;
margin of the wood, still iterating the names of&#xD;
the young ladies, but with no better success.&#xD;
The idea now occurred to him that both had&#xD;
possibly gone to. the governor's residence, and&#xD;
&#xD;
'E ROVER.                             63&#xD;
that he should either find or hear from them&#xD;
there.&#xD;
Accordingly he hastened thither without de-&#xD;
lay. He learned that they were not there, and&#xD;
that Mademoiselle Helen had not been at home&#xD;
since dark. Louis hurried back to his own&#xD;
house, still buoyed up by the hope that they had&#xD;
already returned. The door of his dwelling was&#xD;
open, and Alice stood upon the steps.&#xD;
"Have they come ?" asked.Ridelle, hastily.&#xD;
"No, Louis ; have you not-seen them ?"&#xD;
"No, wife; I can find no traces of them. I&#xD;
have been to the forest, called them in a loud&#xD;
voice, and searched all along the woods skirting&#xD;
that part of the town. .I have been to the gov-&#xD;
ernor's residence, and  Mademoiselle Helen&#xD;
has not been there since dark," replied Louis.&#xD;
" Bring me the lantern, wife, and I will go to the&#xD;
woods once more. I scarcely know how to ac-&#xD;
count for my sensations, but my heart is full of&#xD;
the most painful apprehensions, Make haste,&#xD;
Alice."&#xD;
Large tears stood in the eyes of Madame Ri-&#xD;
delle, as she placed the lantern in the eager&#xD;
hands of her husband.&#xD;
"Don't weep, wife ; my fears may be ground-&#xD;
less, after all," continued Louis. Seizing the&#xD;
lantern he ran to the orest with a speed that&#xD;
bore testimony to the extent of his fears. When&#xD;
he had reached the cypress tree which he be-&#xD;
lieved was mentioned in the note, he held the&#xD;
light near the earth and examined it attentively.&#xD;
With the ready tact of a veteran woodsman, he&#xD;
discovered the prints of human feet in the dis&#xD;
placed moss and leaves, upon the bent grass and&#xD;
birchens.&#xD;
" This is the impress of a female foot-small&#xD;
and daintily formed-Mademoiselle Helen's, or&#xD;
my good Adelaide's. They evidently sat 'here&#xD;
upon this mossy mound. It is easy for one who&#xD;
has followed an Indian trail to discriminate be-&#xD;
tween the light, small footstep of a woman,' ai1&#xD;
the large, heavy step of a man."&#xD;
The forester paused, and held the lantern1still&#xD;
closer to the ground.&#xD;
" Ha 1" he exclaimed, "here is a track never&#xD;
made by the dainty feet of Adelaide or Helen.&#xD;
The toes incline in, and the heels out;- the owner&#xD;
of both wore moccasins, and was an Indian.&#xD;
Just Heaven ! I shudder to think of the fate  f&#xD;
my poor girl, and my sweet friend and beneface&#xD;
tress. Here are more Indian tracks; and here&#xD;
are some footprints which do not turn in-a&#xD;
white man with moccasins on, doubtless. Where&#xD;
were Pierre and Henri ?"&#xD;

Louis Iilelle ceased, overpowered by his em&#xD;

asme4:&#xD;
On this spot are signs of a slight struggle&#xD;

eh ice, with an imploring look. "It might make&#xD;
e ! them think less kindly of Henri."&#xD;
to   " I will try and act for the best, Alice," replied&#xD;
at the forester, as he left his now solitary cabin.&#xD;
i- * Louis rang violently at the door of the gov-&#xD;
ce ernor's mansion.-&#xD;
ri   " Tell the governor that Louis Ridelle would&#xD;
e, speak with him immediately," he said, in a husky&#xD;
voice, to the servant who appeared in answer to&#xD;
id the bell.&#xD;
as   " His excellency is about retiring," replied the&#xD;
d servant.&#xD;
y.   " I care not. I must see him, even if he were&#xD;

a    Awed by the imperative manner of the forester&#xD;

le his message to the governor without delay.&#xD;
In a few moments Louis. stood face to face&#xD;

is " I come to you the bearer of bad news," fal-&#xD;

cd " She and my daughter have been carried off&#xD;

to " When did this happen ?" he asked, quickly.&#xD;
." This very night."-&#xD;
xd "Tell me the particulars so far as you know&#xD;
ly them," added the governor.&#xD;
be    The forester related the manner. in which they&#xD;

had been a previous appointment by Henri.&#xD;
us " And have you no knowledge of their object&#xD;

th   Ridelle was much confused by this question,&#xD;

THE WHIT&#xD;
&#xD;
The-honest forester could evade the governor&#xD;
no longer, and,he answered with some hesitation:&#xD;
" There was a note, your excellency."&#xD;
"Did you see it, or have you got it ?" de-&#xD;
manded de Bienville.&#xD;
" I have got it," said Ridelle.&#xD;
" To whom was it directe -?"&#xD;
" To Helen-your ward."&#xD;
" Give it to me instantly, Monsieur Ridelle.&#xD;
I have a right to know everything that relates to&#xD;
her," added the-governor, somewhat sternly.&#xD;
With a sorrowful heart the forester drew the&#xD;
note from his pocket where he had placed it after&#xD;
its perusal, and put it, into the trembling hand of&#xD;
the governor.&#xD;
De Bienville's brow grew dark and stormy as&#xD;
he read it.&#xD;
" The knave, the double villain !" he exclaim-&#xD;
ed, angrily, stamping violently upon the floor.&#xD;
" Would that he had been hanged before this&#xD;
wickedness had been consummated."&#xD;
Then turning sternly to the forester, he said,&#xD;
in a reproachful voice:&#xD;
" Do you affect not to understand all this,&#xD;
Monsieur Ridelle ? Are you so blind that you&#xD;
cannot see whose hand has brought this sore&#xD;
calamity upon us ? Tell me no more of the in-&#xD;
nocence of that young dissembler.   He is guilty&#xD;
-guilty as-"&#xD;
De Bienville checked himself.&#xD;
""This note is in Delcroix's hand-writing&#xD;
Monsieur Ridelle, is it not ?" he asked.&#xD;
"I am forced to confess-"that it is," answered&#xD;
Louis.&#xD;
"tIt is the same as that upon the birchen scroll&#xD;
and he acknowledges that'to be his," added the&#xD;
governor.&#xD;
"It's too true, your excellency," replied th&#xD;
forester, sadly.&#xD;
"I have recently been striving to convince&#xD;
myself that Lesage is a villain; but this affai&#xD;
cannot well be laid upon the shoulders of Lesage&#xD;
as broad as they are. This is undoubtedly th&#xD;
chirography of the Rover. Stay, I will compar&#xD;
it with some of his writing that I have in m&#xD;
desk."         %   '           -&#xD;
The governor produced the scroll he had re&#xD;
ceived from Henri, and compared the tw&#xD;
together.&#xD;
"I can detect no difference, Monsieur Ridelle&#xD;
he said, after looking at"the characters attentivel&#xD;
" There is possibly something about this y{&#xD;
to be discovered," added the forester. " The&#xD;
is still a chance for Pierre and Henri to b&#xD;
inocent."&#xD;
&#xD;
[E ~ROVER.                              65&#xD;
" I hope so, most sincerely. My poor, poor&#xD;
Helen ! . I loved her, Monsieur Ridelle, as well&#xD;
as though she had been my own child. Her&#xD;
amiable disposition, her beauty, her many grace-&#xD;
ful and endearing ways, have entirely won my&#xD;
love. This is a severe blow to me. Alas, and&#xD;
for you, also, my friend. But what shall be&#xD;
done ?"&#xD;
" I must take to the trail and follow the dear&#xD;
girls until I f1nd them, or die in the attempt. I&#xD;
am an old woodsman, your excellency, and there&#xD;
is no living thing in the forest that I fear, whether&#xD;
it be savage, or wild beast. Yes," he continued,&#xD;
with increasing energy, " I shall go after them,&#xD;
and if they have suffered wrong at the hand of&#xD;
any white man, that man shall die ; I, Louis&#xD;
Ridelle say it, and will say it until I make my&#xD;
word good."&#xD;
" Noble heart !" exclaimed de Bienville.&#xD;
" Heaven, I feel assured, will reward your efforts&#xD;
with success. But you shall not go alone. I&#xD;
will give you as many men as you choose, to be&#xD;
under your command."&#xD;
" I thank you," replied the forester, " but I do&#xD;
not want them.   One experienced hunter is&#xD;
worth a whole army of raw soldiers on the trail.&#xD;
They wont do ; they would do more harm than&#xD;
good. Trust the whole matter to me. A father's&#xD;
love will not sleep, and will leave no means un-&#xD;
tried to rescue his darling."&#xD;
,  I do, and will trust it all to you," said the&#xD;
governor, earnestly, "and feel that I could not&#xD;
1 entrust the important business to better 'hands.&#xD;
I know that you will not be idle or inactre;&#xD;
, for a daughter's safety claims all° your energies&#xD;
e of body and mind. Iftyou want arms, imiuni-&#xD;
tion, or men, come to me, and all shall be at&#xD;
e your command."&#xD;
As nothing further could be said or 'done in&#xD;
e relation to the unhappy affair, the forester took&#xD;
r leave of the governor to make preparations for&#xD;
, following the abductors of his daughter. Upon&#xD;
e his way to his cabin, he met Captains Lesage.&#xD;
e He was hurrying past him, when the captain&#xD;
y addressed him:&#xD;
"Good evening, Monsieur Ilidelle. Whither&#xD;

o    "Excuse me, captain. I have urgent business&#xD;
to attend to at this time," replied Louis.&#xD;

" It is'possible," said the forester.&#xD;
"I hope, Monsieur,,Ilidelle, that there has&#xD;

It is possible that I am speaking to one of that&#xD;

charity, but, by all the saints in the calendar, I&#xD;
can't do it I. Good night, friend Ridelle, good&#xD;

(captain Lesage wiped his eyes, grasped the&#xD;
hilt of his swordfiercely, and strode away.&#xD;
He left the forester standing in the, street,&#xD;
quite confounded'at the exhibition 6f so much&#xD;
eloquence and sympathy. - He resumed his&#xD;
homeward way, absorbed in thought. Just as-&#xD;
he entered his own door, he exclaimed, half&#xD;
aloud :&#xD;
" Hag, :the fellow! he's too sympathizing.&#xD;
His heart isn't apt to overflow so suddenly. The&#xD;
captain has either been serving the devil lately,&#xD;

which it is."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I A  weary of staying here with these sava-&#xD;
ges," said Pierre Moran, upon the morning suc-&#xD;
ceeding the events just related.&#xD;
" I confess I ain not greatly pleased with hav-&#xD;
ing my movements so much restrained," replied&#xD;
the Rover.&#xD;
"Let us:leave our red friends, then, for a few&#xD;
hours, and walk towards New Orleans," added&#xD;
the hunter.&#xD;
" The proposal suits me well," answered Hen-&#xD;
ri. "I long to look once more upon the spot&#xD;
containing the object of niy love,"&#xD;
"You have expressed my own emotion," said&#xD;
Pierre. "Ldok i the sun is just trembling upon&#xD;
the rim of the horizon. A snart walk of an hour&#xD;
will take us to the margin of the woodbordering&#xD;
New Orleans, from whence we may see tiOe&#xD;
dwellings which contain these so dear to us.&#xD;
And yet;when I think of it, so near an approach&#xD;
to the town may be attended with danger to&#xD;
both, more particularly to-you."&#xD;
"-Brave mien and true lovers heed no danger,"&#xD;
answered the Rover, with a smile. " Take your&#xD;
rifle and let us:go.".&#xD;
The two foresters walked rapidly towards the&#xD;
new settlement.&#xD;

The Rover utter   e concluding sentence in&#xD;
a voice of deep feeling.&#xD;
"It was with the greatest difficulty that I could&#xD;
refrain from spurning him with my foot when he&#xD;
dared to stand up before me and offer me money&#xD;
to take the life ofa fellow-man!" exclaimed Mo-&#xD;
ran. " Had I known you and him as I now do,&#xD;
most bitterly should he have suffered for his in-&#xD;
solence. The moment I saw you-when you&#xD;
hurled aside the savages, and scattered the blaz-&#xD;
ing brands to the winds, I knew you; for the&#xD;
'lying chief' had described you well-his only&#xD;
tribute to truth in a long time, probably. I will&#xD;
now step'forward a little to get a glimpse of&#xD;
Monsieur Ridelle's house. If I see any of the&#xD;

"I had cherished a secret hope that you were&#xD;
innocent, and that all might. yet be explained;&#xD;
but your own words just now undeceive my too&#xD;
credulous heart. Pierre Moran, this insult, this&#xD;
r great wrong, can only be washed out in blood."&#xD;
" Here is some fatal mistake,'\ said the Rover,&#xD;
coming forward and standing between Ridelle&#xD;

"And you, probably, never saw this before ?"&#xD;
added the former, holding up the note once more.-&#xD;
I protest that I never did, to my knowledge,"&#xD;
replied Henri, calmly.&#xD;
Mon Dieu 1" groaned Louis. "What hardi-&#xD;

"oMonsieur Ridelle, will you permit me to&#xD;
look at that paper ." said Henri.&#xD;
Ridelle threw it contemptuously at his feet,&#xD;
and watched the Rover's countenance as he&#xD;
read it.&#xD;
" M.Ridelle,"said our hero, handing the paper&#xD;
to Pierre, 1I most solemnly assure you that I&#xD;
did not write a single letter of that note, and I&#xD;
call heaven and earth to witness to my words."&#xD;
" Tell me what meaning I shall attach to the&#xD;
strange words of Pierre Moran which he uttered&#xD;
when he first stood upon that knoll and looked&#xD;
towards the cabin now robbed of its dearest&#xD;
inmate ?"&#xD;
"I meant that escaping from prison as I had&#xD;
so recently done by his assistance, that all our,&#xD;
movements might be watched by those anxious&#xD;
to work my ruin. We approached the town&#xD;
with caution, for the purpose of looking upon&#xD;
the spot rendered dear to us by those we love.,&#xD;
The remarks of our mutual. friend, Moran, had&#xD;
relation only to the peculiar circumstances in&#xD;
which we are placed. Neither of us entertained&#xD;
the remotest idea that aught unfortunate had&#xD;
befallen Adelaide-the fair girl so highly es-&#xD;
teemed by us all."&#xD;
The bereaved forester sat down-upon the earth&#xD;
and covered his face with.his hands.&#xD;
" I know not what to think," he said, sadly.&#xD;
"Perhaps I have been too hasty:;; if I have, you&#xD;
will forgive a heart-broken man :when I tell you&#xD;
that Adelaide has been stolen from me;. and&#xD;
that Helen Lerowe has shared the same fate."&#xD;
The White Rover staggered beneath the terri-&#xD;
ble intelligence; while Pierre Moran stood ak if&#xD;
transfixed. to the. earth, with pale cheek aid&#xD;
staring eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I forgive you, friend Ridelle," said Pierre, at&#xD;
length,in a mournful voice, " and now nake haste&#xD;
to tell me all you know of this strange affair."&#xD;
" Quick, quick, for I burn with impatience !"&#xD;
cried Henri, while the blood rushed back to his&#xD;
face again, and his eyes flashed with indignation.&#xD;
The forester related all that he knew of the&#xD;
abduction from beginning to end, including his&#xD;
interview with the governor, and with Lesage.&#xD;
" Can you not see," exclaimed the Rover, im-&#xD;
patiently, "that this is the work of Lesage ?&#xD;
Fools ! fools ! are ye all, not to perceive it.&#xD;
Where is the trail ? Let us not waste time, but&#xD;
pursue the abductors to the death.; Come, Ri-&#xD;
delle, be a man ; up and away. Now, Pierre,&#xD;
is the time to prove our claims to woodcraft."&#xD;
"Right, brave boy, right. Shake hands with&#xD;
me, both of you, to assure me of your forgive-&#xD;
ness !" exclaimed Ridelle.&#xD;
"With all my heart and soul," said Pierre.&#xD;
"Here is a hand that never betrayed you, and&#xD;
never will."&#xD;
"And here is another that will never be idle&#xD;
until your daughter is restored to -your arms,"&#xD;
added Henri.&#xD;
" I thank you, my brave lad.. I was mad to&#xD;
suspect you for a moment. And pow I am&#xD;
ready for the trail. Here is where the dear&#xD;
girls sat beneath this tree, expecting your foot,&#xD;
steps every moment, no doubt; and were ex-&#xD;
pecting you when their captors sprang to their&#xD;
side and secured them. The trail starts here&#xD;
and winds off in that direction. I came here to&#xD;
follow it alone, determined never to return with-&#xD;
out my darling."&#xD;
"I perceive that,the party who stole the maid-&#xD;
ens were mounted," remarked Pierre, while .he&#xD;
examined the ground attentively.&#xD;
"cAnd by the particular shape of the hoof, I&#xD;
- learn that they were mounted upon horses young&#xD;
and strong," said the Rover.&#xD;
"By the tracks here beneath the cypress," re-&#xD;
sumed Pierre, "I know that the active agents in&#xD;
this transaction were Indians ; for here are foot-&#xD;
prints which toe in."&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have discovered tracks which do Not toe&#xD;
in," returned the Rover, quickly.&#xD;
" Sufficient evidence," rejoined Pierre, " that&#xD;
the enterprise was conducted by a white man."&#xD;
"I am glad you have made these discoveries,"&#xD;
said Louis. " I had already arrived at the same&#xD;
conclusions. I am fortunate indeed to have&#xD;
such assistants. There is one thing more to be&#xD;
considered ; can you tell what tribe of Indians&#xD;
left this trail ?"&#xD;
"I think I shall be able to tell you after fol-&#xD;
lowing the trail one hour," said Henri.  '.&#xD;
" The trail bends towards the Mississippi," re-&#xD;
turned Ridelle.&#xD;
The little but determined party now moved&#xD;
slowly along the trail, noticing the faintest i-&#xD;
prints left by horses'. feet.&#xD;
"As many as six horses have passed over&#xD;
this ground," observed the hunter.&#xD;
" I was about to make the same remark," said&#xD;
Henri.&#xD;
As the trail was very plain, the foresters now&#xD;
quickened their pace and in less than an hour&#xD;
reached the place where the party crossed the&#xD;
river.&#xD;
There was now a consultatipn inregard to-the&#xD;
manner in which they should reach the opposite&#xD;
shore.. To construct a raft with their hatchets&#xD;
competent to secure them a safe passage-acrog.&#xD;
the Father of Waters, would not be an easy task,;&#xD;
and so Ridelle volunteered to retrace his steps&#xD;
along the river's bank until-he should meet with&#xD;
some boatman or reach the town, where :he&#xD;
could easily procure a canoe.&#xD;
Without loss of time he hurried away to put&#xD;
his resolution in practice.&#xD;
Pierre sat;down on the bank of the river; but&#xD;
Henri was too impatient and restless to remain&#xD;
a. moment at rest, ana so he walked away-by&#xD;
himself to indulge in his own melancholy&#xD;
thoughts without being seen by a human being.&#xD;
Scarcely conscious which way he went, he con-&#xD;
tinued his walk for some time, and as it hap.&#xD;
pened towards the town.&#xD;

 n upon the trunk of a fallen birch. He&#xD;
e    oishceely assunied that position when he was&#xD;

t and-darting onward with the rapidity of a&#xD;
Sde s'aodfill in the man's 'path.&#xD;

dfi p es. He did not speak, for he could&#xD;
i  sst rpi'se and consternation were too&#xD;
allow him to call his vocal organs into-&#xD;

S    pilte cheekiand treamulous limbs.&#xD;
T     eife1ee captain, that this meeting is un-&#xD;
expected to you, and ihea you by surprises'&#xD;
You may well tremble to meet the man whose&#xD;
lif you foully conspired against, and whom you&#xD;
perjured yourself to convict of a capital crime.&#xD;
TIhus far, Heaven in its impartial justice has&#xD;
ovrturued many of youth schemes, and I hope&#xD;
it will inits mercy, baffle that one in which you&#xD;
arenow engaged. Do- not affect an astonish-&#xD;
ment you do not feel, captain, for with me it&#xD;
will vail nothing. I am well persuaded that{&#xD;
tietwo mnising maidens have been abducted by&#xD;
&#xD;
your agency; but I do mest solemnly assure&#xD;
you-and you may write it down in your mem-&#xD;
ory as something certain-that yon' will never&#xD;
live to reap ithe reward which you earnestly&#xD;
hoped to when planning this new piece of vil-&#xD;
lany. Helen Lerowe scorns you with her whole&#xD;
soul, and were she a thousand miles from here&#xD;
in the very heart of a savage country, she would&#xD;
still spurn you from her with unutterable con-&#xD;
tempt."&#xD;
" This insolence shall not be forgotten !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Lesge, passion at length getting the&#xD;
better of his fears.&#xD;
"Be careful that you tempt not my mood !"&#xD;
retorted Henri. " I may forget myself, and&#xD;
throw you into the waters of that darkly;flowing&#xD;
river: Who could tell the' tale of your death, if&#xD;
some days from hence your body should be&#xD;
found among the dank weeds many miles below&#xD;
here ?"'&#xD;
" Remember, vain and impudent boaster, that&#xD;
I am armed," returned the captain, laying his&#xD;
hand upon his sword. " Iknow how to use this&#xD;
weapon," -he added, with a show of courage&#xD;
which he did not really feel.&#xD;
"I care not for your swordI To me it is'but&#xD;
a feeble reed; for I have right and justice upon&#xD;
my side, and without these the best-tempered&#xD;
steel loses its keen edge. The polished blades&#xD;

THE Will&#xD;
&#xD;
of Toledo are net formidable when wielded by&#xD;
men who pervert truth and trample honor under&#xD;
their feet, when matched with those who fight in&#xD;
efence of innocence and virtue."&#xD;
" What dos all this idle nonsense portend ?".&#xD;
cried Lesage. "Out of my path, and let me&#xD;
pass!"&#xD;
" Do not stir," returned they Rover, impres-&#xD;
sively, " do not stir as much as a single inch, un-&#xD;
til I have done with you."&#xD;
"This u paralleled effrontery surpasses all&#xD;
my powers o endurance I" exclaimed the captain.&#xD;
" Who but contemptible cowards would hire a&#xD;
man to slay a fellow-creature in cool blood.&#xD;
Think of it, captain, and tear those badges&#xD;
which tell your rank, from your shoulders. I&#xD;
shall live to expose your villany yet."&#xD;
"But you will never live to wed Helen Le-&#xD;
rowe !" retorted Lesage, whose courage was mo-&#xD;
mentarily rising as he saw no absolute hostile&#xD;
demonstrations on the part of Henri.&#xD;
" Speak not of her, Lesage. Do not repeat&#xD;
often the name of Helen Lerowe. She is too&#xD;
pure for lips like yours to speak of."&#xD;
"'leale yourself with that delusive idea, if you&#xD;
will; but know, insolent adventurer, that she,&#xD;
loves me."&#xD;
"Loves you !" exclaimed Henri, disdainfully.&#xD;
Ay, son of nobody, I had it from her own&#xD;
lips," returned Lesage, with a sneer.&#xD;
"I believe you uttef a falsehood. You might&#xD;
reiterate that a thousand times, and I would not&#xD;
credit the talc," replied Henri.&#xD;
The captainwas now thoroughly aroused.&#xD;
"The governor's ward would not link her des-&#xD;
tiny with a condemned felon, without name and-&#xD;
without parentage. Perliaps you never thought&#xD;
of thist:;,but she has; and so has the governor.&#xD;
No ! no 1" continued the captain, with a mock-&#xD;
ing laugh, f Helen 4towe, the fairest maiden in&#xD;
Louisianawillnever wed the son of nobody,"&#xD;
The nerves of the Rover could bear no more.&#xD;
Before the- captain had anticipated the move-&#xD;
ment enough to draw his sword, he had sprung&#xD;
towards him and struck him down with his&#xD;
clenched hand, and spurned him with his foot.&#xD;
Stung to madness by the punishment, Lesage&#xD;
recovered his feet as quickly as possible, and&#xD;
matdp furious passes at Henri with his sudord ;&#xD;
but the latter parried them with his tomahawk,&#xD;
which he wielded with a dexterity only acquired&#xD;
by long association with the Indians. In a mo-&#xD;

"I will not cheat the hangman," said Hen4,&#xD;
as Lesage stood disarmed before him, and at hia&#xD;
mercy. " I will leave you to a punishment far&#xD;
greater than any I can now inflict; for it is not&#xD;
impious to believe, that heaven has already&#xD;
marked you for a fearful doom. Go, and re'&#xD;
member that I shall ever be upon your track, to&#xD;
detect your villanies and expose your wicked!&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
With these words Henri walked away. He&#xD;
had gone but a few paces when he heard the re-&#xD;
port of a pistol, and a ball whistled by his head.&#xD;
He turned quickly towards the spot where he&#xD;
had left Lesage, and saw him runningas fast at&#xD;
he was able. The Rover. levelled his rifle, but&#xD;
changed his mind, and did not fire,&#xD;
" Not now," he said to himself, "not now.&#xD;
Let me wait till my innocence is established, and&#xD;
then I shall see hira sinking to his proper place."&#xD;
"It would be a waste of powder and ball"&#xD;
said a voice. Henri looked towards the speaker&#xD;
and beheld a man in the prime of life, and wea-&#xD;
ing the garb of a forester.&#xD;
"You have -done well to spare him, young=&#xD;
man I" he added. " The measure ,of his wiel~~&#xD;
edness is not yet full. Let him go on:for a sho&#xD;
time longer, ,and his career of crime will be&#xD;
consummated."&#xD;
" You know Lesage, then ?" said Henri, aston-&#xD;
ished at what he heard.&#xD;
"I know him well. I, have observed hi.&#xD;
long, and when other eyes failed to detect his&#xD;
villanies. The day of his triumph is well nigh&#xD;
spent; the night of his disgrace and ignominy&#xD;
approaches. , I have heard of the abduction +t&#xD;
the maidens. I am well.assured thatyou, had gpo&#xD;
agency in it ; neither had Pierre Moran."&#xD;
" It would seem that you know me also?"&#xD;
plied the Rover.&#xD;
" Believe me, Monsieur Deleroix, tha thee&#xD;
are but few I do not know in the French colony,'&#xD;
answered the stranger, whom the reader win&#xD;
recognize as Boisbriant, the secret agent of d&#xD;
Bienville.&#xD;
"Should I be deemed impertinent wereIh Y&#xD;
ask with whom I am conversing ?" askedor&#xD;
hero, much interested in the stranger.&#xD;
"I am one who flits silently from place&#xD;
place ; one who is known by many names, and&#xD;
familiar with many disguises ; one who se&#xD;
much,;Vand is little seen,.and who Snows mue,&#xD;
and is little known," replied Boisbriant.&#xD;
" You ar~e the secret agent of ide Bienville,"&#xD;
said Henri, With A smile.&#xD;

fHow knew you, young' man, 'that he had a&#xD;

By'the shierest accident I have arrived at that&#xD;
iowledge; but from it source that never did and&#xD;
iever trill bettay you or your plans," returned'&#xD;
the Rover.'&#xD;
-" I 'have seen'de Bienville, and I have read the:&#xD;
writingyou sent him. You stated the truth-and&#xD;
nothing more," added Boisbriant.&#xD;
"' I thank you for yout'good"opinion. It pro-&#xD;
dices a"thrill of unspeakable pleasure to hear&#xD;
ote,iwho has had an opportunity of knowing the&#xD;

'gratified tone.'                      '&#xD;
"I have declared your itinocence in the pies-&#xD;

ahaken his faith in your 'integrity," added the&#xD;

"Alas, my friend, Iseem' destined to be con-&#xD;

'said Hesiri, earnestly.&#xD;
&#xD;
" We must part now," added Boisbriant, "bat&#xD;
we shall meet again ; yea, more than once, and&#xD;
in places and under circumstances when least&#xD;
expected, perhaps. Bear up under adversity&#xD;
like a man; keep a bold heart in your bosom,&#xD;
and present a bold front to your enemies. Per-&#xD;
severance and virtue must triumph at last over&#xD;
all obstacles."&#xD;
"Before we part," said the Rover, earnestly,&#xD;
"may I ask if we have often met before ; if ever,&#xD;
where, and when ?",&#xD;
"All ingood time ; it matters not now. Lin-&#xD;
ger no longer here. Remember that your Helen&#xD;
is in captivity, and torn from you by the arts of&#xD;
a, villain. Follow her captors like a tireless&#xD;
hound. Prsue them with the cunning of a ser-&#xD;
pent, and a perseverance no toil can discourage,&#xD;
and no danger appal.",&#xD;
With these words Boisbriant waved his hand&#xD;
and walked away, and in a few seconds was out&#xD;
of sight.&#xD;
The Rover hastened back to the spot where&#xD;
he had left Pierre. When he reached the mar-&#xD;
gin of the river, he saw a canoe containing four&#xD;
persons approaching from the direction of New&#xD;
Orleans. Before it touched the shore, Henri&#xD;
recognized Madame Mablois, La Glorieuse, Ette&#xD;
Actal, and Ridelle.&#xD;
"'I am indeed happy to see you, Madame Ma-&#xD;
blois !" exclaimed the Rover, warmly embracing&#xD;
the Frenchwoman. " And you, also, fair daugh-&#xD;
ter of the Sun," he added, extending his hand&#xD;
to the princess.&#xD;
" My dear Henri," said Madame Mablois, "I&#xD;
have suffered much on your account: but I thank&#xD;
Heaven that I see you at liberty, and out of im-&#xD;
mediate danger."&#xD;
"And I must not forget to thank youand the&#xD;
princess for the liberty I enjoy. It is to you that&#xD;
.I am indebted for my freedom, as well as to the&#xD;
two gallant hearts who were the direct agents in&#xD;
my escape."&#xD;
Madame Mablois took Henri by the arm end&#xD;
drew him gently from his companions.&#xD;
' You have known me from     your child-&#xD;
hood, Henri," she said with feeling, "and you.&#xD;
know that I cherish for you a mother's regard.&#xD;
I know whither you are now going. For my'&#xD;
sake be careful of your own safety. Do not ex-&#xD;
pose yourself to unnecessary danger."&#xD;
"And why should I cling to life with such&#xD;
tenacity'" he answered. f -Has existence been&#xD;
so precious to me hitherto'that should *ish to:&#xD;
preserve  . it so e.rrefully. Were I like many o't'&#xD;
&#xD;
ereit might be different. Remember, dear Ma-&#xD;
dame Mablois-you who have supplied the place&#xD;
of a mother to me with such fidelity-that I'am&#xD;
a nameless youth. I am called Henri Delcroix ;&#xD;
but why I was thus named,'I know not. Upon&#xD;
this  bject I am daily growing more .sensitive.&#xD;
It gives me pain to reflect upon what I may pos-&#xD;
sibly be. Is it not in your power, my more than&#xD;
friend, to clear up this mystery? I.feel that it is;&#xD;
and I do most earnestly entreat of 'you to tell&#xD;
me the worst. Anything is better than this un-&#xD;
certainty ; even an humiliating truth' is prefera-&#xD;
ble to suspense so painful."&#xD;
"Wait yet a little longer, Henri. If .I know&#xD;
aught of your parentage, rest assured that I keep&#xD;
it from you for the best of reasons. You know&#xD;
me too well to imagine that I would withhold&#xD;
any intelligence which would be for:your inter-&#xD;
est. Try and feel that I am acting like a -rea-&#xD;
sonable and discreet friend, and anxiousto make&#xD;
you happy, and better your condition in life.&#xD;
This much I will say ; you need not be ashamed&#xD;
of the blood that circulates in your veins ; it&#xD;
would not disgrace a prince. Have faith in&#xD;
Heaven's justice, and in me. The night of your&#xD;
sorrow, is passing, and the sun of your prosperity&#xD;
and happiness is already rising; even now it&#xD;
trembles on the eastern verge."&#xD;
Mablois paused.  Her bosom- swelled- with-&#xD;
pride. She grasped the Rover's arm, and spoke&#xD;
with thrilling earnestness.&#xD;
" Henri, you are not what you may have&#xD;
thought yourself to be. No, no ! You will yet&#xD;
be rankedwith the best blood of the land. Your&#xD;
proud and lofty spirit will yet rise to its proper&#xD;
place. As the sun of Lesage goes down, yours&#xD;
will go up towards the zenith. Be not despond-&#xD;
ing. In your attempts to save the fair and be-&#xD;
loved Helen from the fate to which a villain has&#xD;
doomed her, I again repeat be careful of your&#xD;
own life ; for you must live to triumph over all&#xD;
your enemies. Yes, you must, and I feel and&#xD;
know that you will."&#xD;
"Your words, dearest madame, inspire me&#xD;
with a new hope. My pulses beat with a newj&#xD;
life, my blood flows with a more genial warmth.&#xD;
Henceforth I will struggle manfully with my&#xD;
fate. I will try to be all that you can wish.&#xD;
Fear not foe me. All will be well."&#xD;
" Nobly poken, my brave boy. Now my heart&#xD;
beats more lightly than your own. Let us re-&#xD;
turn to our friends ; they wait for us."&#xD;
While   ablois ,was speaking, the sound of&#xD;
horses' feet were heard, and in a momeflt twelve&#xD;
mounted warriors made their appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
Henri and Pierre grasped their weapons, bu4&#xD;
relinquished them again when they perceived&#xD;
that the new comers were a party of Natch'&#xD;
warriors. -j&#xD;
"What means this, La Glorieuse ?" asked the:&#xD;
Rover.&#xD;
" Those are some of our bravest warriors tht&#xD;
I sent for two days ago. If the White Rover&#xD;
wants them, they are ready to go on the trail&#xD;
and fight his enemies," replied the princess&#xD;
"This is kind, noble, generous La Glorieus_,&#xD;
I am indeed grateful. I will consult with n5i&#xD;
friends in regard to the matter."&#xD;
After some consultation with Pierre and IRl-&#xD;
delle, it was agreed'that they shouldset forwap'&#xD;
without the Indians ; and if nothing were heard -&#xD;
from them at the expiration of several days, the&#xD;
warriors might take the trail and follow. In&#xD;
this way, being well mounted, they might over-&#xD;
take them in season to be of much use. /Matters&#xD;
being thus arranged to the satisfaction of all&#xD;
parties, they took leave. of their kind friends&#xD;
the renegade set them across the river in the&#xD;
birchen canoe, and they started on the trail with&#xD;
a determined zeal which no obstacles could&#xD;
daunt.&#xD;
" It is as I had expected," observed the' Rover;&#xD;
"the trail tends towards the Sabine river, and&#xD;
the countryof the far-famed Camanches. I per&#xD;
ceive that there- is much danger and hardship&#xD;
before us. Not only shall we be obliged to cord&#xD;
tend with the subtle devices of Lesage, bit t6&#xD;
dare the vengeance of the most formidable 69ol1&#xD;
red nations." &#xD;
"I am willing to dare dangers ten times s&#xD;
imminent," returned Moran, firmly. "I am re-&#xD;
solved to penetrate to the very heart of the ene-&#xD;
mies' country in defence of innocence and&#xD;
beauty. y shudder to think of the sufferings of&#xD;
the poor girls. I cannot well restrain my im-&#xD;
patience."&#xD;
" Here is something," said Louis Ridelle to&#xD;
Henri, "which I found beneath the cypress; but&#xD;
I forgot to mention it before. It has been worn&#xD;
upon the dainty arm of one whose name I need&#xD;
not pronounce."&#xD;
"Helen's bracelet !" exclaimed the Rover.&#xD;
"'Give it to me,, friend Ridelle. I will wear it&#xD;
next my heart until she is again .restored to&#xD;
liberty."&#xD;
Henri pressed the golden band to his lips, and&#xD;
then placed it carefully in his bosom.&#xD;
" And here is something," observed Pierre,&#xD;
picking a small glove- from the ground, " which&#xD;

hunter had returned with the most delicate por-&#xD;
tions of a fat buck upon his shoulders. It was&#xD;
roasted at the roaring fire, and eaten in sil ke-&#xD;
as a duty,:and not as a pleasure.&#xD;
" Being the oldest of the party," said Ridelle,&#xD;
" though perhaps not the wisest and most expe-&#xD;
rienced, I hope to be pardoned for making a few&#xD;
suggestions for the general safety, and for the&#xD;
success of our undertaking. - I think it advisable&#xD;
that one of us should ever be on the watel,&#xD;
while the other two sleep. It seems to me thit&#xD;
we should commit a great and fatal error if i a&#xD;

country."&#xD;
'After some further conversation upon the sub-&#xD;
ject, it was unanimously resolved that they&#xD;
should watch by turns, during the night, until&#xD;
their undertaking was bought to a successful&#xD;
or an unsuccessful close. Henri and Pierre in-&#xD;
sisted upon discharging- this necessary duty un-&#xD;
assisted; but to this }proposition Ridelle would&#xD;
by no means agree.&#xD;
These preliminaries being satisfactorily ar.&#xD;
ranged, Ridelle and Pierre laid down in their&#xD;
blankets. The White Rover, withdrawing a few&#xD;
paces from the fire, with his rifle in his hand&#xD;
kept tireless watch over his companions.&#xD;
&#xD;
WinH the consent of the gentle reader, we&#xD;
will now follow the fortunes of the captive&#xD;
maidens.&#xD;
It was the night of the third day of their&#xD;
weary pilgrimage towards the country of the&#xD;
Camanches. The mesdemoiselles were alone in&#xD;
a small lodge, which had been prepared for&#xD;
them nightly, while the Indians kept watch&#xD;
without.&#xD;
"It seems strange to me," said Helen, "that&#xD;
we have been treated with so little rigor during&#xD;
our captivity. The savages are not wont to ex-&#xD;
hibit so much humanity. We have been per-&#xD;
mitted to rest for the greater portion of two&#xD;
nights. A lodge has been ereeted for us, and&#xD;
we have had the satisfaction of being entirely&#xD;
alone during the time allowed'us for sleep. Now&#xD;
there is certainly something unaccountable in&#xD;
all this."&#xD;
"I have'thought of the subject more than&#xD;
once," replied Adelaide, "and it still remains&#xD;
unexplained."&#xD;
"1Would it be unreasonable to suppose that&#xD;
Lesage had something to do with this transac-&#xD;
tion ?"-asked-Helen, seriously.&#xD;
"You reiterate my own thoughts, Helen," re-&#xD;
turned Adelaide. "Perhaps I wrong the cap-&#xD;
taim, but it does seem to me that my suspicions&#xD;
are not without foundation. It is very certain&#xD;
&#xD;
that Henri and Pierre have had no agency in&#xD;
our misfortunes."&#xD;
" I have not thought ill of them for a moment,"&#xD;
responded Helen.&#xD;
"Our treatment is far too gentle," resumd&#xD;
Adelaide, "to correspond with my ideas of Xn4&#xD;
dian character. I fear that they are but the&#xD;
agents of other minds."&#xD;
" Then may we shudder at the fate before us,"&#xD;
slid Mademoiselle Helen. "Savages are some-&#xD;
times moved to mercy, but there are those who&#xD;
show none."&#xD;
Both of the mesdemoiselles paused, and were&#xD;
occupied with their own gloomy thoughts.&#xD;
Some deerskins, sewed together with thongs,&#xD;
hung up before the entrance to the lodge. Tihe r&#xD;
were put gently aside -at that, moinent, and a&#xD;
painted visage became visible. While with li$i&#xD;
left hand the intruder held aside the skins, he&#xD;
motioned themto silence with hit right. 'Ihe&#xD;
girls drew back in alarm. The intruder stppd&#xD;
into the lodge, and the skins fell back again.&#xD;
"Do not be alarmed," he said, ii a whisper,&#xD;
and in t  e purest French. "I am your friend-&#xD;
I have come to save you, or 'perish in the&#xD;
attempt."&#xD;
"If-you have indeed come to saves tswe ow&#xD;
you a deep debt of gratitude," said Helen.&#xD;
" Hush, mademoiselle !" continued the srai-&#xD;

ing on all sides of us. I have literally stepped&#xD;
over their bodies for the purpose of speaking a&#xD;

I entreat of you."&#xD;
The interior of the lodge was quite dark.&#xD;
The stranger's face could not be distinctly seen;&#xD;
and it was with difficulty that his low-whispered&#xD;
words could be beard and understood. But&#xD;
then he spoke of the danger he had incurred for&#xD;
their sakes, and expressed a determination to&#xD;
save them, they began to feel that a ray of light&#xD;
had at length fallen upon their darkened way.&#xD;
The stranger drew nearer,'and laid his finger&#xD;
gentle, yet warningly, upon Adelaide's arm, and&#xD;
resumed, in the same suppressed whispers:&#xD;
"Ihave hoverednear you for two days-wit-&#xD;

"The saints preserve us from such a fate 1"&#xD;
exclaimed Helen, with a shudder of horror.&#xD;
"Most fervently I respond to the pr  ,"&#xD;
continued the intrepid stranger. " As far&#xD;
am concerned, I need no further incentive to&#xD;
action than that inspired by your sufferings,&#xD;
your youth, beauty, and heroism."&#xD;
"But could you not aid us more effectually by&#xD;
returning to New Orleans? You would have&#xD;
only to repeat the story of our captivity in order&#xD;
to raise the means of our deliverance. The gov-&#xD;
ernor would put you at the head of five hundred&#xD;
men, if need be, to follow us into the Indian&#xD;
country; men who would fight bravely, nor fear&#xD;
hardship."&#xD;
" You forget, fair mademoiselle," rejoined the&#xD;
unknown, "that the Camanches are as numerous-&#xD;
as the leaves  . on the trees. They can bring&#xD;
five thousan warriors into the field, yea, more&#xD;

" Your only hope of rescue," resumed the un-;&#xD;

Adieu-fair captive-adieu."&#xD;
Helen followed him mechanically to the door&#xD;
of the lodge, raised the skins and looked out&#xD;
afteg*im, and saw him glide along with breath-&#xD;
less silence. The unconscious figures of several&#xD;
Camanches were asleep upon the ground in front&#xD;
of the lodge. She saw him pause, look cau-&#xD;
tiously around upon the sleepers, and then actu-&#xD;
ally step over their bodies and walk silently and&#xD;
swiftly away. His person was soon hidden from&#xD;
view by the trees. Helen still gazed aftet him,&#xD;
while her heart was agitated by various emo-&#xD;
tions ; but she saw only the wild-wood scenery,&#xD;
the long, sombre shadows of the trees, the pale&#xD;
moon, the twinkling stars, the blue skies, and&#xD;
the sleeping figures.    '     .    '&#xD;
She let the skins fall back to tieir place, and&#xD;
stole back to the side of Adelaide, who had not&#xD;
moved from her seat.&#xD;
" What are you thinking of? Why so gloomy&#xD;
and silent ?" asked Helen, embracing her com-&#xD;
panion, tenderly.&#xD;
"I am thinking of many, many things, sweet&#xD;
friend, and I scarcely know what makes me so&#xD;
sad. Have you forgotten the stranger's story of&#xD;
the Indian maidens ?" said Adelaide, in reply.&#xD;
Helen was silent, but her fair person was con-&#xD;
vulsed with, horror ; and her companion was&#xD;
conscious of the nervous tremors that shook her&#xD;
frame at the mention of the Indian girls.&#xD;
" Adelaide," she said, recovering herself, " why&#xD;
is not this the hour of escape ! The savages are&#xD;
sleeping soundly. No watchful eyes save our&#xD;
Heavenly Father's are upon us. Why can we&#xD;
not leave this lodge and glide cautiously away&#xD;
in the deep, wild, forest, even as that stranger&#xD;
has done ?. What more favorable opportunity&#xD;
than this ?"&#xD;
" Your words are reasonable. Let us fly,"&#xD;
replied Adelaide, arising hastily.&#xD;
"A singular thought occurs to me, Adelaide !&#xD;
Why did not this generous, self-sacrificing, and&#xD;
fearless stranger urge us to fly with him imme-&#xD;
diately, and not have waited for a more favor-&#xD;
able opportunity? Does this not strike you as&#xD;
being very extraordinary'?"&#xD;
"It does ; but perhaps he waits for some friends&#xD;
to join him, or has some more safe and feasible&#xD;
plan of escape in his mind," answered Mademoi-&#xD;
selle Adelaide.&#xD;
" The explanation you offer is plausible, but&#xD;
d~es not wholly satisfy me. Dear friend, shall&#xD;

'E ROVER.                                77&#xD;
we indeed attempt to escape, while our captors&#xD;
are sleeping ?" said Helen.&#xD;
Adelaide put aside the deerskins and'looked&#xD;
anxiously forth. The r9d men were still locked&#xD;
in slumber.&#xD;
" I think we might venture to try," she replied,&#xD;
stepping back to the side of Helen. " We cani&#xD;
but fail, and I know we cannot render our con-&#xD;
dition more deplorable. My mind is full of&#xD;
vague and fearful suspicions, also, that I have&#xD;
not yet expressed. I feel more than ever anxious&#xD;
to escape from these savage beings, if it be only&#xD;
to perish in the wilderness, of hunger, and thirst,&#xD;
and weariness. Is not any death preferable to&#xD;
that fate which is in reserve for us. They may&#xD;
follow us, it is true, but we are light of footgpnd&#xD;
we can    along without scarcely bending dawn&#xD;
the grass, or disturbing the leaves. And then&#xD;
we can take precautions that will defy them to&#xD;
trace a trail so faint as that we will leave, in our&#xD;
flight. We will seek out the most impassable&#xD;
places. We will pursue our way along the ranges&#xD;
of hills, where the soil is hard and unyielding to&#xD;
steps like ours. We will not break a twig from&#xD;
the smallest bush; we will not roll a stoie from&#xD;
its place ; we will not displace the" moss upon&#xD;
the knolls, nor the sticks that lie -on the ground,&#xD;
In flying from a fate so dreadful, we shall leave&#xD;
a way as trackless as the flight, of the birds&#xD;
through the air."&#xD;
" Even so, Adelaide. God will not abandon&#xD;
us in the hour of trial," responded Helen. - "He&#xD;
will strengthen our limbs when they falter. He&#xD;
will fortify our hearts with courage'when about&#xD;
to despair. He will feed us when we are hungry,&#xD;
and give us water when we. are sinking with&#xD;
thirst. He clothes the lilies; He cares for the&#xD;
birds ; He watches over the innocent. I am&#xD;
ready. Let us walk forth softly as shadows, and&#xD;
if they wake not, there remains for us chance&#xD;
for liberty."&#xD;
" How I tremble," said Adelaide. " My heart&#xD;
beats like a bird trying to escape from his cave.&#xD;
Stop an instant-let me recover myself a little.&#xD;
Now I am calm. Lift the skins once more. Are&#xD;
they sleeping yet ?"&#xD;
" One has partly arisen," whispered Helen,&#xD;
trembling with excitement. " He yawns and sinks&#xD;
back again. The blessed virgin be praised !&#xD;
He relapses into sleep. Let me collect ?nyself a&#xD;
little. Come, my dear Adelaide-tep softly-&#xD;
breathe gently--be courageon~-.-bear yourself&#xD;

the lodge door, and made one timid step for-&#xD;
ward, when one ofbthe Camanche warriors turned&#xD;
$   aver, moaned, uttered some incoherent words,&#xD;
arose upon his elbow, and finally to a sitting&#xD;
posture. The captives' retreated precipitately&#xD;
into the lodge, and fell weeping intoeach other's&#xD;
arms;- With emotions of bitter disappointment no&#xD;
pen can describe. In a short time Adelaide&#xD;
looked cautiously forth again. The savage had&#xD;
not resumed the 'recumbent position, but'was&#xD;
still sitting upright.&#xD;
"We must abandon the attempt for to-night,"&#xD;
said our heroine, with a sigh. " It were not best&#xD;
to make an abortive trial, for the consequences&#xD;
would be that weshould be more closely watched,&#xD;
an,. erhaps bound at night; a precaution which&#xD;
oitd. preclude the possibility of. a future&#xD;
Attempt."&#xD;
when the first keen pangs of disappointment&#xD;
had passed (for the pangs of baffled hope are&#xD;
indeed poignant), Helen strove by every effort&#xD;
in her power to appear outwardly calm, in order&#xD;
$o revive the sinking spirits of her companion.&#xD;
She wiped away her tears, and tried to speak&#xD;
cheerfully of the future, addin , in conclusion,&#xD;
A hat the intrepid stranger who had visited&#xD;

stranger. Possibly it is an act of cruelty to&#xD;
make such a statement, but I am compelled by&#xD;
my anxiatypospeak my thoughts freely., Had&#xD;
I full confidence in this unknown, I should not&#xD;
have been so eager to escape from our thraldom.&#xD;
He spoke in whispers, yet I am well assured&#xD;
that I have heard his voice somewhere, but&#xD;
where, I cannot now remember."&#xD;
" Let us not wrong him, my friend, but ob-&#xD;
serve him well, if another opportunity should&#xD;
present. There were times while he was speak-&#xD;
ing when his voice seemed familiar, even to me.&#xD;
I shall try to think of him as a friend, for he&#xD;
certainly spoke feelingly, and with apparent sin-&#xD;
cerity," answered our heroine.&#xD;
"But there are several things to be explained&#xD;
in relation to him," resumed Adelaide. "How&#xD;
did he'arrive at a knowledge of our misfortunes ?&#xD;
Why does he feel such an interest in unknown&#xD;
maidens, that he should expose his life to save&#xD;
them ? A lover, a father, or a brother might&#xD;
have ventured among the savages to rescue a&#xD;
beloved object;. but, believe me, very few stran-&#xD;
gers would do so. I doubt whether this has not&#xD;
all been preconcerted, and this hero comes by&#xD;
previous agreement."&#xD;
" 0, Adelaide !" exclaimed Helen: " I am&#xD;
not willing to believe that such depravity exists.&#xD;
Let us not think of it. Try and sleep, that we&#xD;
may be ready for any opportunity that may be&#xD;
presented for escape."&#xD;
&#xD;
. -;&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE captives laid their weary limbs upon the&#xD;
rude couch prepared for them by their captors,&#xD;
and strove to compose their minds to sleep.&#xD;
Just as they had sunk into an unquiet slumber,&#xD;
they were aroused by the movements of the Ca-&#xD;
manches preparing to resume their wanderings.&#xD;
The most delicate portions of the buffalo, very&#xD;
well roasted, were 'set before them, of which they&#xD;
partook sparingly.&#xD;
" The Indians seem to be very busy. What&#xD;
are they doing ?" asked Helen.&#xD;
" They are wrapping portions of buffalo skin&#xD;
upon the horses' feet, in the manner predicted by&#xD;
the unknown," returned Adelaide.&#xD;
" An ingenious device. Let us exert ourselves&#xD;
more than ever to leave some signs to indicate&#xD;
whither our wanderings tend. I will tear my&#xD;
handkerchief into small pieces, and watch for&#xD;
opportunities to drop them as we ride forward,"&#xD;
said Helen.&#xD;
The maidens were soon- ordered to mount&#xD;
The party moved on, but in a different order-&#xD;
in single file-the captives occupying'the centre&#xD;
of the cavalcade. Both watched with much in-&#xD;
terest to observe the effect of the new precaution&#xD;
which had been taken, viz: that of wrapping the&#xD;
horses' hoofs in- buffalo . skins. They remarked&#xD;
with much sorrow that the experiment subserved&#xD;
well the purpose of their captors, as they now&#xD;
&#xD;
travelled over the firmest ground they could&#xD;
find, and left but faint traces to mark the'4way&#xD;
they had passed over.&#xD;
Helen succeeded in dropping several; pieces of&#xD;
her handkerchief without being noticed. At&#xD;
length the quick eyes of one of the Camanches&#xD;
detected the design. With true Indian addres,&#xD;
he slid down nearly under his horse's flanks, and&#xD;
picked up the piece which Belen had dropped,&#xD;
without dismounting. He shook his head stern-&#xD;
ly, and threatened her with death if she repeated&#xD;
the offence.&#xD;
Whether this menace was seriously made, o&#xD;
not, it terrified the maidens not a little, and&#xD;
they desisted from..any further attempts of that&#xD;
kind at that time.&#xD;
They did not journey so rapidly as' on the&#xD;
previous days, on account of the extraordinary&#xD;
precautions which they were continually ob'serv.&#xD;
ing to baffle pursuit. On one occasiontliey&#xD;
travelled several miles in tlhe bed of a bryoo, the&#xD;
bottom of which was covered with small  nie,&#xD;
where, of course, no trace of a horse tek&#xD;
could be left. The hearts of the unfortunate&#xD;
girls grew hopeless and despairing whe they&#xD;
beheld such unusual caution. Theygaedinto&#xD;
each other's faces in mute and wordless grief. It&#xD;
was some relief to find themselves alone again&#xD;
when they.had encamped for the-night: Though&#xD;

both felt the need of rest, neither could sleep.&#xD;
Innumerable wild conjectures and undefinable&#xD;
fears kept them wakeful. Did they lose their&#xD;
Consciousness for a single instant, some dreadful&#xD;
phantom suddenly arose before them and broke&#xD;
the momentary spell. Though they were in&#xD;
doubt concerning the- stranger, they could not&#xD;
banish the frightful tale he had told them con-&#xD;
cerning the Indian maidens.&#xD;
If that unpleasant subject left their minds, it&#xD;
was to give place to others quite as dreadful.&#xD;
Would the stranger visit them again that night?&#xD;
they asked over and over again.&#xD;
The eyes of both were turned towards the&#xD;
entrance of the lodge ; the deerskins were thrust&#xD;
aside gently as on th  previous night; and the&#xD;
face of the unknown was revealed. Tile moon&#xD;
shone brightly, and her silver beams fell full up-&#xD;
on his features. During the moment of hesita-&#xD;
ion which followed, both the captives scanned&#xD;
his, fafe with intense eagerness, and recognized&#xD;
the features of Hubert, the king's commissary.&#xD;
But his strange discovery produced different&#xD;
emotions in the bosoms of the mesdemoiselles.&#xD;
Adelaise could with difficulty repress a cry of&#xD;
hermr,'while Helen experienced equal difficulty&#xD;

" We are ready to go," said Helen. '"Come&#xD;

-be firm, and the danger will soon be passed."&#xD;
"Silently, silently, mesdemoiselles; follow me&#xD;
-step lightly," said Hubert, opening the door of&#xD;
the lodge.&#xD;
Helen had grasped Adelaide's hand and now&#xD;
drew her along after the commissary.&#xD;
"Back, girls ! back I" whispered the latter, re-&#xD;
treating with alarming precipitation to the ex-&#xD;
treme part of the lodge.&#xD;
" Go and look cautiously out," said the com-&#xD;
missary to Helen, apparently much agitated.&#xD;
Our fair heroine obeyed, and perceived to her&#xD;
horror that one of the savages had arisen from&#xD;
the ground, and was heaping together the de-&#xD;
caying brands of the fire. She repeated the un-&#xD;
welcome intelligence to Hubert, who seemed the&#xD;
picture of dismay.&#xD;
" Discovery, to me, would be certain death,"&#xD;
he said; "but the consciousness that I should&#xD;
perish in the cause of youth and beauty, would&#xD;
serve to soften down the last moments of life,&#xD;
and shed a sweet and heavenly light on the&#xD;
opening scenes of the world to come. Be good'&#xD;
enough to look again, mademoiselle."&#xD;
When our heroine looked forth again, the fire,&#xD;
once more revived by the addition of fresh fuel,&#xD;
was sending up a bright flame. The Indian&#xD;
produced his pipe, refilled it slowly, lit it, and&#xD;
commenced smoking. Helen watched his move.&#xD;
ments with a feeling of anxiety and impatience&#xD;
to be appreciated only by those in a similar sit-&#xD;
uation.&#xD;
The commissary grasped the trembling hand&#xD;
of Adelaide, and, assured her that all might yet&#xD;
be well-that he possibly might yet be spared to&#xD;
be instrumental in their liberation. But Ade-&#xD;
laide withdrew her hand and trembled more&#xD;
violently.-&#xD;
Helen maintained her position near the door,&#xD;
The Camanehe, reclining upon his elbow, with&#xD;
his feet thrust to the fire, watched the stars, and&#xD;
smoked his pipe calmly. His fixed andmedita-&#xD;

shadowy people who -live :there and pursue&#xD;

The night was beautifully serene. The moon&#xD;
never appeared to ,move more softly through&#xD;
the pathless skies, or to look more placidly down&#xD;
upon the earth. The stars hadcaught the samce&#xD;
delightful mood, and shed their; quiet beauty&#xD;
upon ithe night. Nowinds set the.vergntleave&#xD;

THE WHIT&#xD;

in motion, or sighed through the branches of the&#xD;
pine rand sycamore.&#xD;
"How sweet to be at liberty, and with Henri,&#xD;
at such an hour as this," thought Helen. The&#xD;
reflection was but natural, yet by contrast it&#xD;
served to heighten her present dreariness.&#xD;
Most anxiously did she watch the savage,&#xD;
fearing lest he should possibly arise, approach&#xD;
the lodge and look in, when the life of the com-&#xD;
missary would instantly be sacrificed. She ap-&#xD;
prehended also, that others might awaken and&#xD;
follow his example, and so cut off all hope of&#xD;
Hubert and escape. For 'three quarters of an&#xD;
hour the Camanche enjoyed his pipe, which&#xD;
seemed an age to Helen. At length he threw&#xD;
out th'e puffs of snioke with less frequency, and&#xD;
with decreasing interest. The fire died away in&#xD;
the bowl of his pipe, and finally went quite out;&#xD;
the savage closed his eyes, began to nod-roused&#xD;
up-nodded again-the pipe dropped from his&#xD;
mouth, and he fell back upon the earth com-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
pletely overpowered by sleep.&#xD;
Helen breathedmore freely-watched him a&#xD;
moment longer, and then reported to the com-&#xD;
missary.&#xD;
" The favorable hour has passed," sighed Hu;&#xD;
bert. "Indians never sleep soundly after this&#xD;
time. I am forced, by dire necessity, to leave&#xD;
you till a more propitious moment. I doubt&#xD;
even, whether I can depart without raising an&#xD;
alarm. And if Ishould never see you again-&#xD;
that is, should aught unfortunate befall me this&#xD;
night-remember that I-have .done my best to&#xD;
save you; I ask no more than this.' Once more,&#xD;
sweet mesdemoiselles, adieu."&#xD;
the commissary ooked cautiously out into&#xD;
the open air-waved his hand, and the next mo-&#xD;
ment the captives were alone.&#xD;
Suddenly there was a deafening cry without.&#xD;
Helen sprang to the entrance of the lodge and&#xD;
looked after the commissary. She saw him run-&#xD;
ning swiftly, pursued by two tall savages; then&#xD;
she heard the report of fire-arms, saw Hubert fall,&#xD;
recover his feet and disappear in the forest, still&#xD;
followed by the Camanches.&#xD;
" O, Adelaide !" shrieked Helen, "he is wound-&#xD;
ed--he is down-no, he is up again-he rises, is&#xD;
lost to view in the woods !"&#xD;
"9Give yourself no une asiness on his account,'&#xD;
cried Adelaide, drawing Helen into the lodge.&#xD;
"Wghat if he should be slain in attempting to&#xD;
save us !" exclaimed Helen.&#xD;
1Be calm, dear Helen. Monsier r Hubert is a&#xD;
villain," said Adelaide, indignantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
'E ROVER.                              81&#xD;
"No !" said Helen, gazing into the pale face of&#xD;
her friend in unutterable astonishment.&#xD;
" He is the friend and companion of Lesage-&#xD;
the cause of all our misfortunes," replied Ade-&#xD;
laide.&#xD;
" O, this is cruel, Adelaide !" exclaimed Helen.&#xD;
"Cruel indeed! My sufferings for the last&#xD;
hour you cannot imagine. Disgust, indignation&#xD;
and fear have held me in their power by turns&#xD;
during his stay. I thought that time had ceased&#xD;
to go onward, and that he would never leave&#xD;
us," added. Adelaide.&#xD;
" Has he ever spoken to you, Adelaide ?" ask-&#xD;
ed Helen, much perplexed.&#xD;
" Often, often ! He has praised my beauty-&#xD;
afflrmed that he loved me-that he could not&#xD;
exist without me."&#xD;
"And you-"&#xD;
"Rejected him with contempt, for I read his&#xD;
purpose well."&#xD;
"What then, Adelaide ?"&#xD;
" He had the meanness and audacity to&#xD;
threaten."&#xD;
" The friend of Lesage ! Just Heaven ! can&#xD;
this be true ?" exclaimed Helen.&#xD;
" True as inspiration itself," replied Adelaide,&#xD;
firmly. " I warned you, Helen, while he was&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"I know you did, and I could not well com-&#xD;
prehend your meaning. But the Indians fired&#xD;
at him; how is that ?" asked our heroine.&#xD;
" All preconcerted, no doubt, Helen.. The&#xD;
Indians are evidently in his employ, and he did&#xD;
not intend that we should escape. He wishes to&#xD;
play the daring and generous hero, in order tp&#xD;
make an impression in his favor."&#xD;
"Perhaps you are right," responded , elen.&#xD;
"I now remember of having. seen him with Le-&#xD;
sage on several occasions ; and in fact on tIe&#xD;
day of our abduction. The truth dawns upon&#xD;
me, Adelaide ; I see the black -villany of the&#xD;
whole plot."&#xD;
After some further conversation in relation to&#xD;
their unhappy situation, the captives completely&#xD;
exhausted, both in body and mind, sank ito a&#xD;
profound sleep, and obtained the - most refresh-&#xD;
ing rest they experienced during their captivity.&#xD;
They resumed their journey on the following&#xD;
day in the same manner, and with the eme&#xD;
precautions that had marked the preceding one.&#xD;
But Hubert did not make his appearance on&#xD;
the ensuing night ; neither did het on the night&#xD;
after ; which circumstance surprited the cap,&#xD;
tives not a little, and was by no mans regretted.&#xD;

Lance between each other. Having come to this&#xD;
mutual indefstanding, they proceeded to art in&#xD;
accordance with'the same.&#xD;
In a few minutes otir hero was aone. Well&#xD;
acqttainted with Indian stratageas and habits,&#xD;
he directed his footsteps toWardS a long ridge of'&#xD;
low hills on his right. He had gone forward but&#xD;
a short time after reaching the highlands, when&#xD;
to his joy he discovered a small object fluttering&#xD;
upon the ground. He stooped and secured it,&#xD;
It proved, as the reader has already anticipated,&#xD;
a portion of Helen's handkerchief, Which she had&#xD;
dropped to guide the steps of those Who might&#xD;
attempt her rescue. It was of the finest muslin,&#xD;
and the Rover would have easily 'recognized it&#xD;
perhaps, even had he not seen the initials of'&#xD;
the owner's nane upon it.&#xD;
We hope the Indulgent reader will not be dis-&#xD;
posed to smile, when we assert that-Henri press-&#xD;
ed the precious fragment to his lips ; for it was&#xD;
indeed precious to hita, not only on account of'&#xD;
its having been in the possession of the mladen&#xD;
dearest to his'heart, blt because It would serve&#xD;
to direct his footsteps towards her.&#xD;
While the Rover stood gaziit at the bltof&#xD;
stiff, he heard a sound near him, and uponlook-&#xD;
iug up, beheld, greatly to-his astotdshment d"&#xD;
shoe, the Chickasaw chief.,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WHITE&#xD;
&#xD;
"iDo my eyes deceive me ?" exclaimed Henri.&#xD;
" You see me, my white brother," said Red-&#xD;
Shoe, laconically.&#xD;
" And why have you followed us ?" asked the&#xD;
R-, (r.&#xD;
"I saw the daughter of the Sun," replied the&#xD;
chief. " She told me what had happened to the&#xD;
pale maidens, and how the White Rover was in&#xD;
trouble, by means of Chef Menteur. I tightened&#xD;
my belt, took my rifle, and followed the trail."&#xD;
"Generous chieftain ! you are ,indeed my&#xD;
friend. I feel that I can never repay this noble&#xD;
disinterestedness," exclaimed Henri. " And&#xD;
what of the war with the Choctaws ?" he'added.&#xD;
immediately.&#xD;
"1There will be no fighting with them at pres-&#xD;
ent. We shall be able to punish Chef Menteur&#xD;
before war breaks out with the Choctaws," re-&#xD;
plied Red-Shoe.&#xD;
Henri now called loudly to his companions.&#xD;
They soon found him, much pleased to learn&#xD;
that their party had been, strengthened by the&#xD;
addition of such a noble ally. By the aid of&#xD;
Red-Shoe they went forward much more rapidly,&#xD;
for he was very acute in discerning Indian signs.&#xD;
They were enabled to discover the precise spot&#xD;
where they took to the bed of the brook, and the&#xD;
place where they left it; and several fragments&#xD;
of the handkerchief which had been dropped by&#xD;
the captives, were also found.&#xD;
The day passed without any further incident&#xD;
worthy of note. At night they encamped as&#xD;
usual. Not feeling inclined to sleep, Henri left&#xD;
his comrades, and walking some fifty rods from&#xD;
the encampment, seated himself upon the trunk&#xD;
of a fallen tree, upon the summit of a small hill.&#xD;
With so many things to think of, he was soon&#xD;
lost in the mazes of his own thoughts. We need&#xD;
not tell the reader of what he thought, -for he'&#xD;
- will arrive at that by a natural inference. It&#xD;
may well be supposed that at that time, the&#xD;
beauties of starlight, and moonlight, had but few&#xD;
attractions for the Rover.&#xD;
The sound of horses' feet -approaching at a&#xD;
leisure pace caused him to look anxiously around.&#xD;
A single horseman was advancing ; but whether&#xD;
he was a savage or a white man, Henri at first&#xD;
was at a loss to know; nor was he fully satis-'&#xD;
fled on this point until be was addressed.&#xD;
"A timely meeting," said the horseman.&#xD;
"We have met before, and recently, if I re-&#xD;
member rightly," replied Henri, much more sur-&#xD;
prised than when he had been joined by Red-&#xD;
Shoe.&#xD;
&#xD;

"Yes," answered Bdisbriant, dismounting. "I&#xD;
am the same you refer to, doubtless. You are&#xD;
on the trail, I perceive. What luck ?"&#xD;
" We have followed the trail but too literally--=&#xD;
done nothing else-found nothing else," replied&#xD;
the Rover.&#xD;
"Ah, well-keep up good courage. Perse-&#xD;
verance accomplishes wonders, sometimes," said&#xD;
Boisbriant.&#xD;
am greatly astonished at this meeting,'&#xD;
returned Henri. " May I aslk what brings you&#xD;
here ?"&#xD;
" Certainly-my horse brought me," rejoined&#xD;
Boisbriant.&#xD;
" Very true," said the Rover, with a smile.&#xD;
" May I.presume to ask your object in allowing&#xD;
yourself to be brought here by your horse ?"&#xD;
" A good, a commendable one, I hope, Mon-&#xD;
sieur Delcroix," rejoined the secret agent. "2I&#xD;
feel an interest 'in the fate of these maidens.&#xD;
Not only dlo I confess a deep solicitude in regard&#xD;
to the fate of the captives, but also a-strong de-&#xD;
sire to unmask as great a villain as, ever walked&#xD;
upon the face of the wide earth. There are&#xD;
many other-rhen that Lesage might deceive and&#xD;
evade, but me he can neither deceive nor evade,&#xD;
I sympathize with you, young man, in your&#xD;
sufferings."&#xD;
I am very, very grateful," replied the Rover,&#xD;
impressively.&#xD;
"You perceive, Delcroix, that the freshness of&#xD;
youth and the fire of early manhood with me&#xD;
have passed ; from these I have glided by gra-&#xD;
dations into the maturity of life. -My hairs are&#xD;
not yet plentifully sprinkled with gray, but they&#xD;
should be, for I have suffered. Look at me,"&#xD;
Henri. I have also felt the happiness of recip-&#xD;
'rocated love. But many years have elapsed&#xD;
since I last heard the voice of Irene."&#xD;
" You were disappointed, then ?" asked Henri,&#xD;
earnestly.&#xD;
"Cruelly, sadly disappointed I' exclaimed&#xD;
Boisbriant.&#xD;
" She was forced to wed another, I suppose,"&#xD;
remarked the Rover, much interested.&#xD;
"No; it was not.that. -Irene became iny wife&#xD;
-loving and beloved. Let me sit down here be-&#xD;
side you, and IRill tell you something about it;&#xD;

&#xD;
was not at that period rich, but possessed of a&#xD;
competence."It was expensive living in Paris&#xD;
in the style I wished. In an evil moment I ac.&#xD;
eepted an office in the infant colony on the banks&#xD;
of the Mississippi, pleased with the thought that&#xD;
I should acquire a fortune for my wife and child.&#xD;
" Thousand idle tales were then afloat in re-&#xD;
gard to the'facility of amassing riches in this&#xD;
country, not one of which could be considered&#xD;
true, or ought to have been thus considered.&#xD;
Like a; silly fish I swallowed the gilded bait.&#xD;
Irene was delighted at the idea of visiting a&#xD;
new country, whose breezes were balm; whose&#xD;
sunshine was glory; whose forests were orange&#xD;
trees; whose -stones were gold; whose sands&#xD;
W0e6,diamonds ; whose springs were fountains&#xD;
of immortal youth. We planned cottages, man-&#xD;
sions, summer-houses, arbors, grounds, gardens,&#xD;
andi .know not what, to grace our imaginary&#xD;
paradise.,&#xD;
"sy little daughter was a year ol when we&#xD;

s}R  b'=tttha Indians were.also greatly to be&#xD;
s    cliintwg murders were frequetin the&#xD;
&#xD;
colony. The spell of my delightful dream was-&#xD;
broken. I felt sad at heart, and one of those&#xD;
horrible presentiments of coming evil crept&#xD;
through every fibre of my brain, and made me&#xD;
stagger with the dread of something that I knew&#xD;
nothing about.&#xD;
" De Iberville brother of the governor, and an&#xD;
old acquaintance, met me at Biloxi. He strove&#xD;
to infuse new life and courage into my heart,&#xD;
but it was easy to see that he felt sad himself.&#xD;
Something was evidently weighing heavily upon&#xD;
his spirits. Iberville was a noble fellow ; brave,&#xD;
generous, and high-souled; but there was some&#xD;
singular mystery connected with his stay in the&#xD;
colony. ,It was some love affair, which I could&#xD;
never fully fathom. I entered upon my duties&#xD;
with what zeal I could, under the circumstances.&#xD;
" Irene bore up finely under the shock which&#xD;
we had both received in relation to the new&#xD;
country. She even affected to be pleased with&#xD;
her condition; but I knew better. One morning&#xD;
I left my new home with Iberville, to visit a&#xD;
small party of emigrants, who had settled upon&#xD;
the Mississippi river. I kissed Irene and' my&#xD;
little daughter gaily, telling them I should soon&#xD;
return. I, observed that Irene looked paler than&#xD;
usual, and held my hand longer in hers than she&#xD;
was wont, when she said adieu."  -&#xD;
Boisbriant 'paused at'this stage of his narra-&#xD;
tive, overcome by his emotions.&#xD;
" When I returned," he resumed, " I had no&#xD;
wife, no child, no home. I found my darling&#xD;
wife near the river's bank, foully murdered by&#xD;
the Indians-and scalped-robbed of her long,&#xD;
beautiful hair, of which I had been so proud.&#xD;
The body of my daughter could not be found;&#xD;
but some of its clothes. were discovered in the&#xD;
river, lodged among the weeds. Its fate was&#xD;
but too evident; it had been thrown into the&#xD;
water ! My fintic grief I will not dwell upon.&#xD;
The cruelty of this blow I will leave wholly to&#xD;
your imagination. I felt like a crushed and&#xD;
broken-hearted man, and resolved to return to&#xD;
France. I shall not soon forget an incident&#xD;
which transpired previous to my putting this&#xD;
resolve into execution. It was a light, placid&#xD;
night like this. Iberville and myself were walk-&#xD;
ing together.&#xD;
"'Did you ever have a presentiment V he&#xD;
asked, with a smile.'&#xD;
" I replied that I hadone when I first saw the&#xD;
mouth of the Mississippi river.&#xD;
"'I have a presentiment now,' said Iberville.'&#xD;
"' And what is it ' I asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
S.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WHI&#xD;
&#xD;
'c'Death !' he replied softly, and with an&#xD;
earnestness I shall never forget.&#xD;
"' I have observed that something unpleasant&#xD;
has been preying upon your mind for a long&#xD;
- time,' I added.&#xD;
"'It is so, my friend. My sorrow is a secret&#xD;
which must perish with me,' he replied, mourn-&#xD;
fully.&#xD;
It is a love-secret, I presume,' I replied.&#xD;
"'I acknowledge it; I will tell you this much&#xD;
and no more: I have a wife and child,' he said,&#xD;
earnestly.&#xD;
"' Where ?' I exclaimed.&#xD;
"That I may not tell you. There are many&#xD;
and powerful reasons why they are not with&#xD;
me ; but it was my destiny that this should be,&#xD;
and I have submitted. Keep my secret, Bois-&#xD;
briant.' I promised to do this.&#xD;
"'She's a lovely girl, and is content to be my&#xD;
wife under any circumstances ;.for she loves me,'&#xD;
added Iberville.&#xD;
"'And does de Bienville, your brother, know&#xD;
aught of this ' I asked.&#xD;
"'Nothing definitely. He only knows that&#xD;
my affections are placed upon some object; but&#xD;
who she is, and where she is, he does not know,&#xD;
and has too much delicacy to ask what he is&#xD;
quite sure I do not wish him to know.'&#xD;
"' I can conceive of no reasons sufficiently&#xD;
powerful to induce you to keep the facts you&#xD;
have communicated a secret,' I remarked.&#xD;
"'My dear Boisbriant, there might possibly&#xD;
be many reasons for pursuing such a course. It&#xD;
might even be done to secure a fortune-a vast&#xD;
fortune-to make my child the inheritor 'of&#xD;
wealth, and a name, perhaps. Can you-not con-&#xD;
ceive of something of that kind ?'&#xD;
"'Certainly,' I replied; 'such things have&#xD;
- happened more than once or twice. -.But a noble&#xD;
name your child will assuredly have, if it bear&#xD;
the name of Iberville.'      '&#xD;
"'But a noble name without fortune is noth-&#xD;
ing worth, and serves only to bring its=owner&#xD;
into contempt'&#xD;
" Iberville paused, and with folded arms gazed&#xD;
at the waters of the Mississippi. I heard the&#xD;
twang of a bow-string, and a low groan from&#xD;
Iberville. I looked towards him, and saw an&#xD;
Indian shaft deep buried in his bosom. 'He fell&#xD;
back1into my arms-looked pleasantly into my&#xD;
face, despite the torture of his wound, smiled&#xD;
sweetly, and expired. And thus passed the no-&#xD;
blest spirit that ever exerted an influence upon&#xD;
the fortunes of Louisiana. The news of his&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
TE ROVER.&#xD;
death cast a gloom, over the colony, for hW&#xD;
manly conduct from first to last had ei'dehtit&#xD;
him to etery one. I can even now recall tthe&#xD;
form of de Bienville, kneeling by that aiiuliing&#xD;
corpse. I have seen many  A stoni heart liake8&#xD;
with grief; many a daring eye wll with tda;&#xD;
but I never saw grief like his; for'they had loved'&#xD;
like David and Jonathan, until the twain°a$'&#xD;
become as the soul of one man."&#xD;
Boisbriant ceased.&#xD;
" Speak on ! speak on I" exclaimed Henri.&#xD;
"I went back to Paris, and after the lapse dN&#xD;
a few years returned again to the colony, dr}WW&#xD;
back to the scene of my sufferings 'bg so n-&#xD;
strange impulse ; perchance I wished to be nii&#xD;
the grave of Irene. I have done," added B&#xD;
briant, sadly.&#xD;
"Your relation has interested sie desi-y&#xD;

"No doubt ; true hearts always feel anhis&#xD;

you shall hear something still more inter'4,&#xD;

"Go on, if you please," said the Rover.'&#xD;
" What I have to communicate pe,  pa i&#xD;

" The commissary!i" exclaimed Henri.&#xD;
"I have discovered the important fact that he&#xD;
is even now with the captives."&#xD;
" Impossible !" cried the Rover.&#xD;
" Not at all. I will explain. The comenissary&#xD;
is the accomplice of Lesage. The motives which&#xD;
actuate him refer wholly to Adelaide; while&#xD;
those which stimulate Lesage have reference to&#xD;
Helen. The Camanches are employed by both&#xD;
the scoundrels. Hubert follows them for the,&#xD;
purpose of playing the hero. He has formed&#xD;
the nolfle resolution to aid the mesdemoiselles-to&#xD;
escape from the Indians, and thus acquire their&#xD;
confidence. He imagines that by taking this&#xD;
course, with Adelaide under his protection, filled&#xD;
with the idea that he is a daring and generous&#xD;
benefactor, he shall be able to make an impies-&#xD;
sion on her heart, and thus ultimately effect his&#xD;
base purpose."&#xD;
" The villain !" said Henri.&#xD;
"I have followed the party on horseback, and&#xD;
being well acquainted with the country of the&#xD;
Camanches, I overtook them on the second day&#xD;
of their journey, and have dogged them e'vr&#xD;

" And punish such high-handed villany as it&#xD;
deserves. Let us not lose an instant, monsieur,&#xD;
but follow the - scoundrels immediately. I can-&#xD;
not rest while such a scheme of consummate&#xD;
villany is being enacted. I desire nothing more&#xD;
earnestly than to stand face to face with that&#xD;
commissary. Hero indeed.!, If my hands were&#xD;
-once upon him, he would never wish to play the&#xD;
heroic benefactor again during his life."&#xD;
Boisbriant and Pierre Moran met like old&#xD;
friends. The strange news which the former&#xD;
had communicated to Henri, was now repeated.&#xD;
The hunter and Ridele listened with fierce and&#xD;
scowling brows.&#xD;
"Lead the way," said Moran, huskily, "lead&#xD;
the way, and we'll follow."&#xD;
"It is well spoken,"- added Ridelle. "Let us&#xD;
press forward to thwart this atrocious wicked-&#xD;
ness."    -&#xD;
" orward-forward-upon the trail-no rest&#xD;
-no s , until the maidens are free !" 'ed&#xD;
Henri:.&#xD;
" I am ready, good friends. This is the way,&#xD;
and may Heaven speed us I" said Boisbriant.&#xD;
With dark and threatening visages, and minds&#xD;
firmly fixed upon vengeance,  the foresters fol-&#xD;
lowed Boisbriant.&#xD;

CllAPTER XiX.&#xD;
A MEETING-THE oSAPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
SEVERAL days had elapsed site the disap-&#xD;
pearance of the mesdemoisdlles. The night had&#xD;
already set in.- Two persons were sitting upon&#xD;
the west bank of the Sabine River.&#xD;
" You have followed sooner than I had ex-&#xD;
pected, captain," said one.&#xD;
"I found it was necessary no time should be&#xD;
lost, Monsieur Hubert," replied the captain.&#xD;
" The affair is creating quite an  excitement at&#xD;
New Orleans; for the girls are highly esteemed&#xD;
there. "I am suspected, notwithstanding all&#xD;
our cunning. In fact I met that fire-eater, my&#xD;
evil genius, and he accnsed me of the abduction&#xD;
of the maidens, without stopping to mince mat-&#xD;
ters. ,I owe him another debt, and I will be&#xD;
sure to pay him."&#xD;
"Did he do you any personal violence l" ask-&#xD;
ed Hubert-&#xD;
" I barely escape with my life."&#xD;
" Why did you not run him through with your&#xD;
,word, captain ?"&#xD;
" Mon Dieu !" I attempted to, but he was more&#xD;
than a match for me with his tomahawk. He&#xD;
broke my sword at the hilt, tand then benevo-&#xD;
lently spared my life for a greater punishment&#xD;
than that of being genteelly tomahawked"&#xD;
"For which you thanked him."&#xD;
"For which I fired my pistol at his head,&#xD;
rNo sieur-Hubert."    _&#xD;
&#xD;
"Did you hit him V'&#xD;
" Hit him ? no! he was not born to be hitibUt&#xD;
to live to be my ruin. The fates protect hitn, I&#xD;
believe. Now tell me how- you speed with Ade-&#xD;
laide. Have you played the hero with success '&#xD;
"Admirably, admirably,- my .boy! .I har&#xD;

$$                  THE WHITE ROVER.&#xD;
&#xD;
firth-walk over the savages as though they&#xD;
were logs of wood-gain the forest-breathe&#xD;
more freely-the girls pant with excitement---&#xD;

right-nobody's business-sweet mesdemoiselles&#xD;
..Ah I Lesage I"&#xD;
"Fair, but proud Helen, you shall yet be won !"&#xD;
exclaimed the captain, triumphantly. " You&#xD;
scorned me once, yea, twice ; but now, haughty&#xD;
beauty, the power is mine. And I shall crush&#xD;
and humiliate, both in one-the peerless Helen,&#xD;
the fire-eating Rover  Sccre Dieu! but will it&#xD;
not crush his proud spirit !"&#xD;
Lesage rubbed his hands and chuckled over'&#xD;
his prospective triumph. In his diabolical mal-&#xD;
ice, he resembled a fiend from the bottomless&#xD;
pit, more than a man.&#xD;
" We will pay back the scorn they have heaped&#xD;
upon us at different times," added Hubert.&#xD;
' IDearest Adelaide-sweet charmer-I come, I&#xD;
come-a dainty piece indeed ! But I am; wild&#xD;
with impatience," continued the commissary,&#xD;
'pith a theatrical air. "'T is time, captain. The&#xD;
moon rides high in the heavens-the-hour has&#xD;
Come.' Now shall we reap our reward for all&#xD;
our dangers-and-and-rascalities," resumed&#xD;
Hhiettr "Await me here. Inhalf anihour Iwill&#xD;

hMfds tolele frofn 'the lodge. °They stepped&#xD;

rsinrzBnlit they had passed the dangerous vicinity,&#xD;
atI'eif "fai y figures were moving rapidly&#xD;
didgitie  oi-est.&#xD;
"  M'rond f sight of the lodge-we shall&#xD;
~oon be far away," said Helen.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Heaven be praised !" exclaimed Adelaide.&#xD;
"Let me recover my breath a little. How my&#xD;
heart palpitates. Now we willrun."&#xD;
" This is indeedafortunate-blessed-providen-&#xD;
tial !" cried a voice. The maidens looked at&#xD;
each other in mute despair ; for'it was the com-&#xD;
missary who had spoken.&#xD;
"It shall be my proud and happy privilege to&#xD;
conduct you to your friends, unfortunate maid-&#xD;
-ens," he added. " There are horses near at hand.&#xD;
Others of your good friends have joined me ;&#xD;
and two of them I think you will not be dis-&#xD;
pleased to see. This way-a few rods down to-&#xD;
wards the valley-hurry, mesdemoiselles-no&#xD;
time to lose-Indians don't sleep sound-may&#xD;
wake up-follow-kill us all."&#xD;
Taking-Adelaide by the arm he gently urged&#xD;
her onward, and Helen followed, holding her by&#xD;
the hand she had not relinquished since she left&#xD;
the lodge. For a few moments the commissary&#xD;
hurried them along. They did not speak, nor&#xD;
struggle,nor complain, nor acknowledge that they&#xD;
suspected that all was not right : they had no&#xD;
power to do so ; they were bewildered and as-&#xD;
tounded by the sudden overturning of their&#xD;
hopes.&#xD;
Hubert at length ceased to urge the captives&#xD;
onward. He stopped, and a man joined him&#xD;
instantly. The commissary pointed to Helen&#xD;
with a significant smile.&#xD;
" Sweet Mademoiselle Helen !" exclaimed&#xD;
Lesage, seizing the hand of our heroine. Helen&#xD;
shrieked with horror, and drew it from him. im-&#xD;
mediately.&#xD;
Imagine, if you can," added. Lesage, "the,&#xD;
joy that I feel in knowing that I have assisted in&#xD;
your escape from a 'thraldom so dreadful-so&#xD;
cruel-so hopeless, so-"&#xD;
" Cease to dissemble longer," replied Helen,&#xD;
recovering her self-possession somewhat. "Lay&#xD;
off the mask, and show yourself the despicable&#xD;
villain that you are. And you, sir," turning to&#xD;
the commissary, " can follow his example. We&#xD;
know you for a vile hypocrite-a smooth-tongued&#xD;
ruffian---a mean-spirited coward-a double-deal-&#xD;
ing knave--a wretched impostor, unfit to breathe&#xD;
the air of heaven."&#xD;
'A-fair beginning, truly," said Hubert,'abashed&#xD;
in spite of all his effrontery.&#xD;
"Fair, indeed !"'rejoined Lesage, contemptu-&#xD;
ously.' Helen Lerowe," he added, with a wicked&#xD;
smile of triumph upon his lips; "the time when&#xD;
you could scorn and insult me is past. I dtm no&#xD;
longer a suitor, to kneel and use honeyed woren&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WHITE ROV R&#xD;
&#xD;
No I nol that period is gone by. It is now you&#xD;
turn to sue and supplicate. There are mango&#xD;
many rough, dismal miles of wilderness betwee&#xD;
you and your home. No friend can start u&#xD;
from the ground to save you; no hand can wrest&#xD;
you from my grasp. I will, and do, throw o&#xD;
the mask.. Know that you are in my power an&#xD;
can expect no mercy. You love the man I hat&#xD;
with intense hatred. Were it no more than t&#xD;
punish, crush, humiliate him, you should not b&#xD;
pitied or saved."&#xD;
"Imagine, Mademoiselle Adelaide, that I hay&#xD;
said the same words to you," exclaimed th&#xD;
commissary.&#xD;
"Do not touch me !" cried-Adelaide, terrific&#xD;
at what .she had heard, as Hubert endeavored t&#xD;
grasp her arm. " There is poison in the fou&#xD;
contact !"&#xD;
"Offer me rlo indignity," said Helen, retreat&#xD;
ing from Lesage. "Remember that you ma'&#xD;
feel his vengeance."&#xD;
"Whose ?" exclaimed Lesage, disdainfully.-&#xD;
"You know who," answered Helen.'&#xD;
" Stuff, nonsense, foolery ! I care not for Del&#xD;
croix. He is a renegade, a felon, and a-a-"&#xD;
"Nay.; he is none of those you have named&#xD;
I deny the charge," retorted Helen.&#xD;
" O, that Pierre Moran were here !" said Ade&#xD;
laide, half frantic with fear.&#xD;
"Cease to yex yourself about him. He is not&#xD;
needed. I am the hero of this occasion," said&#xD;
the commissary.&#xD;
"You see that it is of no use to struggle with&#xD;
destiny," resumed Lesage. ".You have lost in&#xD;
this game; I have won; submit gracefully. It&#xD;
were folly to attempt to elude me now. Shud-&#xD;
der, if you will; look around you, expecting&#xD;
some strange rescue ; or call on Hieaven, as all&#xD;
forlorn damsels dor .how very singular that&#xD;
Heave;            such prayers !"&#xD;
" I       °t nu;often, unfeeling and blas-&#xD;
phemeNi io ter!" ",cried Helen.&#xD;
"Be merciful--spare us-take us back to our&#xD;
frientls !" exclaimed Adelaide, falling upon her&#xD;
knees.&#xD;
"You look beautifully in that chaining atti-&#xD;
tude," said the commissary.&#xD;
"If it would avail aught, I would most earn-&#xD;
estly join in the petition; but alas, what prayers&#xD;
or tears could move such beings to the exercise&#xD;
of common humanity !" said Helen; and then&#xD;
turning to the commissary, she exclaimed, in&#xD;
tones of touching entreaty : " Have you no feel-&#xD;
ing of honor,.no remains of goodness to make&#xD;
&#xD;
Ir you ye aman-no finersensibilities to be awak-&#xD;
y, ened-no relentings-no tender pity-no- soft&#xD;

p    "He is guilty of nothing of the kind:!" said&#xD;
t Lesage. "You but wasts words-you do not,&#xD;
ff cannot move us; and Heaven is not propitious.?&#xD;
d "Heaven is: propitious i" exclaimed a voice,&#xD;
;e which made theflushed cheeks of Lesage grow&#xD;
o deadly pale. " Heaven is propitious."&#xD;
e   Before the captain had recovered from the first&#xD;
stupor of astonishment;,the breech of-the Rover's&#xD;
e rifle had fallen upon his head, and beaten him to&#xD;
e the ground.&#xD;
" That is for you !" cried Pierre Moran, deal-&#xD;
d ing the commissary a blow which laid him sense,&#xD;
o less beside his companion in guilt.&#xD;
d   Helen's eyes fell upon Henri; she clasped=her&#xD;
hands, looked up to heaven, and the next mo-&#xD;
- meant lay insensible in the arms of the Rover;-&#xD;
y while Adelaide, embraced alternately by, ie&#xD;
and her father, was weeping in the excess of her&#xD;
joy.&#xD;
During this time Boisbriant and Red-Shoo&#xD;
- secured Lesage and the commissary,.having&#xD;
bound their hands firmly behind them. 'The&#xD;
. captain was the first to recover from the effldta&#xD;
of his punishment.&#xD;
-   "What means this violence ?" he exclaimed,&#xD;
calling all his effrontery to his aid, and resolWg&#xD;
t to put the best face upon the matter to thedatL&#xD;
S   " It means," said Boisbriant, sternly,_'tha&#xD;

" That your sun is setting, and your night&#xD;
coming on, as- I told you," added the Rover«&#xD;
"A thousand bitter maledictions upon your&#xD;
head !" exclaimed Lesage, literally gnashing his&#xD;
teeth until his mouth was white with foam.'If&#xD;
my, own flat could hurl you :down to the deep'&#xD;
depths of the pit, you would soon be wrthingu&#xD;

The captain paused to gather. calmness enough&#xD;
to proceed, and then went on with increasing&#xD;
energy. "But I am not dead yet. I may live&#xD;
many years, and perhaps I may walk over your&#xD;
grave-and perchance I may yet help to lay you&#xD;
there. Fool that I was, not to have taken bette,&#xD;

"Do not say too much," replied - enri, "1sor&#xD;

"I curse you most bitterly," continued Hubert,&#xD;
in the agony of his fear. "I curse: you for an&#xD;
unmitigated scoundrel-the author of my ruin !"&#xD;
'" Craven-hearted traitor !" returned the cap-&#xD;
tain. " You jave been as ready, as eager and de-&#xD;

the hour of our downfall, you turn and curse&#xD;
me. 0, but I will remember it, Hubert. I will&#xD;
expose you. I will tell all your plottings against&#xD;
de Bienville, and of the letters you have writ-&#xD;

" And you wished to kill Henri Deleroix be-&#xD;

yourself, and made others to perjure themselves.&#xD;
You bought up the negroes, and you produced a&#xD;
piece of bark, containing characters made merely&#xD;
to beguile time, and which you well knew proved&#xD;
nothing; and you turned those harmless dia-&#xD;
grams into damning evidences of guilt. You&#xD;
hired an assassin, also, to accomplish what your&#xD;
treachery bad failed to do. What do you say&#xD;

" you have been a very bad man-a snake in the&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
THE GRAND DENOUEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
WE scarcely'need pause to explain the sudden&#xD;
appearance of the foresters. The kind reader&#xD;
will, by a natural and easy deduction, arrive at&#xD;
the truth of the matter. Led on by Boisbriant,&#xD;
they had reached the vicinity of the encampment&#xD;
in time to witness a portion of the scene which&#xD;
had ensued between the captain, the commissary,&#xD;
and the maidens. Boisbriant, Ridelle, and Red-&#xD;
Shoe had stayed near Lesage, while the Rover&#xD;
and Pierre had followed the commissary. They&#xD;
had seen the mesdemoiselles fall unconsciously&#xD;
into his hands-and the whole party had silently&#xD;
closed up around the villains and their intended&#xD;
victims, when the events transpired just related.&#xD;
"1This is a pleasant spot ; let us encamp for&#xD;
the night," said Boisbriant.&#xD;
All parties gladly acquiesced in the proposal.&#xD;
A large pile of wood was shortly collected-a&#xD;
cheerful blaze soon cast its ruddy light upon the&#xD;
surrounding forest. Many green boughs were&#xD;
cut and laid upgn the ground, and blankets&#xD;
spread upon those, until an air of comfort seemed&#xD;
to breathe around them all. During these pre-&#xD;
parations there was much talking, and much&#xD;
happiness experienced by the lovers and the&#xD;
rescued maidens. The fierce, vindictive. looks&#xD;
of the two prisoners'alone marred the general&#xD;
feeling of pleasure.&#xD;
"Ihear the sound of horses' feet," said Red-&#xD;
&#xD;
Shoe, putting his ear close to .the earth. Tie&#xD;
mesdemoiselles glanced at their lovers in alarm.&#xD;
"It is true," said the Rover. "I can hear&#xD;
them myself, and there are many of them."&#xD;
" I will go and reconnoitre," said Onalaska,&#xD;
and immediately left them. The other foresters&#xD;
cocked their rifles, and awaited with muchtlsa-&#xD;
iety the result. Presently the footsteps griw&#xD;
more' distinct, and the sound of -voices was&#xD;
plainly heard.&#xD;
"They are Frenchmen I"exclaimed Boisbriant.&#xD;
The agreeable surprise of the foresters it is no&#xD;
easy matter to describe, when they perceivd a&#xD;
large cavalcade advancing, composed ef 4he ,&#xD;
lowing characters, viz., de Bienville, Ftherr-&#xD;
vion, Madame Mablois and La Glories  whisl&#xD;
the rear was brought'up by twenty well mnted&#xD;
Frenchmen, an4 thirteen Natchez warriortby&#xD;
renegade included in the number. The gy .&#xD;
ernor was engaged in earnest conversation W;I&#xD;
Red-Shoe, as he advanced, and was prepsgdod r&#xD;
what he now beheld.&#xD;
"This is indeed a surprise," exclaimted dole.&#xD;
"Yes," replied the governor, smiling "it-is a&#xD;
double surprise; ford am quite as much or more&#xD;
surprised, than you are. Henri, my brerbog,&#xD;
step forward, and let me speak to au.&#xD;
The governor's voice shook-i  motoitas&#xD;
he spoke.&#xD;

Henri advanced a step, and de.Bienville has-&#xD;
tily .dismounted.&#xD;
"acre DieuI" exclaimed the governor, gaz-&#xD;
ing earnestly at the White Rover. "The very&#xD;

your uncle, and your father's name was Iber-&#xD;
vllle-the noble-the fearless-the generous-&#xD;
the self-sacrificing Iberville, who was as dear-to&#xD;
me as my own life."&#xD;
Do Bienville ceased, overcome by his feelings.&#xD;
Large tears coursed down his cheeks..&#xD;
Henri stood like one astounded. He neither&#xD;
moved nor spoke ; surprise kept him dumb.&#xD;
"Yes, you are an Iberville, every inch an&#xD;
Iberville," continued the governor, proudly em-&#xD;
bracing Henri. " I might have known it by your&#xD;
noble figure and lofty bearing ; by your fearless&#xD;
spirit, and by the strong resemblance."&#xD;
"Mon Dieu! I am bewildered," exclaimed&#xD;
our hero, at last. " This cannot be true."&#xD;
"It is'true as holy writ," said Madteme Ma-,&#xD;

hentleian 'pf dissoiute&#xD;
&#xD;
knew, he was the one I held in the least esteem&#xD;
or to speak more to the point, I utterly despised&#xD;
him. This person professed to love me as ar-&#xD;
dently as I hated him. My father wished me to&#xD;
wed him without delay. I refused, and he vowed&#xD;
to disown and disinherit me. Ihad already met&#xD;
de Iberville, and loved him, and listened with&#xD;
pleasure to his vows of unceasing constancy,&#xD;
although I was at that time aware that a hope-&#xD;
less feud existed between the father of Iberville&#xD;
and my own. To influence my mind, my father&#xD;
showed me a will, drawn up in due form, by&#xD;
which I was to be disinherited, if I married&#xD;
against his wishes. Upon the evening of that&#xD;
very day, I was secretly married to Iberville.&#xD;
A few months after taking this step, to escape&#xD;
from the tyranny of my father, and the impor-&#xD;
tunities of the man he had selected for my hus-&#xD;
band, I left Paris forever, and set sail for the&#xD;
new colony with my beloved Iberville. On the&#xD;
passage he exacted from me a solemn promise&#xD;
to keep the fact of our marriage a secret until&#xD;
after the decease of my father, the chevalier.&#xD;
"'I shall never touch a franc of his long-&#xD;
hoarded wealth,' said my' husband; ' but the&#xD;
helpless being, that will shortly demand your&#xD;
care, may one day feel the need of riches. I have&#xD;
long felt-an impeifect organization has pressed&#xD;
home the conviction with prophetic. truth-that&#xD;
I shall not live to see my child arrive at matu-&#xD;
zity. Let us then, my dear wife, keep our mar-&#xD;
riage .a secret known only to ourselves and a&#xD;
few friends in the new country to which we care&#xD;
going. Your father may relent, and leave the&#xD;
bulk of his vast wealth to you, which he will&#xD;
never do if he leans that you have linked your&#xD;
fortunes to one of my father's family, as you are&#xD;
aware, that a deadly feud exists between the&#xD;
heads of the two families-a quarrel which leaves&#xD;
us nothing to hope in the way of reconciliationo'&#xD;
" Knowing the noble motives which influenced&#xD;
sy husband, I made a solemn agreement with&#xD;
him never to divulge the fact of our marriage in&#xD;
any manner, so that .it could reach the ears of&#xD;
my father. Tberville was greatly belovedby the&#xD;
Natchez. A beautiful cottage was reared for&#xD;
me in one, of their pleasantvillages. My, hus-&#xD;
band passed much of his time with me, and I&#xD;
was happy. I.was a mother also; and Iberville&#xD;
idolized ur- Henri. He was a year old when&#xD;
his f there died. I confided a small :part of my&#xD;
secret to Father Davion-enough to secure ;hi&#xD;
aid, and my boy was taught mango. tigggby a'&#xD;
him which I could not have learnd himu    I&#xD;
&#xD;
gave him the name of Henri Delcroix, by which&#xD;
he has ever since been known, and studiously&#xD;
concealing from hin the fact that I was his&#xD;
mother.'&#xD;
"You all kknow how much interest I have&#xD;
ever manifested in this youth, and truly I have'&#xD;
kept my promise to Iberville. Four days ago I&#xD;
received the intelligence that my father had de-&#xD;
ceased at an advanced age,leaving all his wealth&#xD;
to me; for I had informed him in various ways&#xD;
and at different times, that I was still living.&#xD;
Henri is now rich, and no stain rests upon his&#xD;
name. The nearest that I ever came abandon-&#xD;
ing my purpose of keeping our marriage from&#xD;
the governor, was when my boy was in prison.&#xD;
-But happily everything was ordered for the best.&#xD;
I was instrumental in his escape, and was not&#xD;
obliged to divulge the secret of his birth at that&#xD;
time.&#xD;
" When I received news that my father was,&#xD;
no more, there was no longer any need that I&#xD;
should observe secrecy. I explained all to his&#xD;
excellency, and burning with impatience to em-&#xD;
brace his nephew, he set out at once-took the&#xD;
trail, and has happily found him."&#xD;
Helen wept plentifully during this recital, and&#xD;
Boisbriant was observed'to gaze steadily at her.&#xD;
"Father Davion," he said, at length, in an ex-&#xD;
cited manner, " can you tell me anything in re-&#xD;
lation to the history of this young lady ?"&#xD;
"Alas I I know no more of her history than&#xD;
that she was left in my cabin during my absence,&#xD;
about sixteen years ago. She was then about&#xD;
two years of age, and I should judge, had been&#xD;
living among the Indians for some time. She&#xD;
had upon her neck a small locket, containing a&#xD;
miniature," replied Father Davion.&#xD;
"Where is the miniature ?" asked Boisbriant,&#xD;
still more excited.&#xD;
"Here," said Helen, drawing a locket from her&#xD;
bosom. " I have worn it ever since I can re-&#xD;
member."&#xD;
"It is she-my Irene! Helen, you are my&#xD;
child !" and Boisbriant caught Helen to his heart&#xD;
and held her in a long and loving embrace.&#xD;
" I am too happy," murmured Helen. "It is&#xD;
joy indeed to feel a father's love at last."&#xD;
Boisbriant made a significant motion to de&#xD;
Bienville. The latter took -Henri's hand and'&#xD;
led him towards Helen, and then toisbriant&#xD;
joined the hands of the two. Madame Mablois&#xD;
smilingly brought forward Father Davion, and&#xD;
left him directly in front of the parties.&#xD;
"Stop one moment, if you please," said Ri-&#xD;
&#xD;
delle. " There is more to be done in that way."&#xD;
Saying these words, he proceeded to place&#xD;
Adelaide and Pierre Moran in the same order.&#xD;
Obedient to the order of de Bienville, the sol-&#xD;
diers and warriors closed up around the parties.&#xD;
Father Davion wiped his eyes for the hun-&#xD;
dredth time, and was about to say something,&#xD;
when Madame Mablois stopped him with:&#xD;
" Stop another moment, good father. Some-&#xD;
thing more can be done, I believe. Red-Shoe,"&#xD;
she added, in a whisper, approaching the chief&#xD;
softly, and smiling, " would you not like to wed&#xD;
the princess ?"&#xD;
" Does the sun love to kiss the clouds, or the&#xD;
stars to look down upon the -earth at night ?&#xD;
Does the grass love the gentle rains, or do the&#xD;
flowers turn toward the light ?" he asked.&#xD;
" La Glorieuse," continued Soft-Voice, " the&#xD;
great war-chief loves you better than the grass&#xD;
loves. the gentle rain, or the flowers love the&#xD;
light. Come and wed him, that all maybe hap-&#xD;
py, and not a single virtuous heart beat sadly&#xD;
here to-night."&#xD;
La Glorieuse extended her hand to Red-Shoe.&#xD;
Soft-Voice formed them into a line with the&#xD;
others, and Father Davion wiped his eyes again.&#xD;
Boisbriant turned to the French and Indians.&#xD;
" My fine fellows, open your mouths and shout&#xD;
as loud as you can. Now-go it again-louder&#xD;
-louder-twice as loud. That'll do ;'very good."&#xD;
Such shouts as went up from the forest at that&#xD;
time were never heard before, or since.&#xD;
" Wait a little longer, Father Davion, and&#xD;
you may go ahead with full speed," added Bois-&#xD;
briant. " Sergeant Dumont and CorporalRion,&#xD;
clap your hands upon those two rascals, lying&#xD;
on the ground there, and bring' them up here so&#xD;
they can see well," he added.&#xD;
"Come up here, my beauties," saidthe ser-&#xD;
geant. " Take hold of his feet, Corporal-tug&#xD;
him along. Don't kick, captain ; it m= n it,&#xD;
harder for us, and it's a wedding you'regoing&#xD;
to."&#xD;
Iii half a minute the captain and the comnmis-&#xD;
sary were placed in front of the persons to be&#xD;
wedded.&#xD;
"I wish I was dead and covered up in the&#xD;
ground;" muttered the captain, fiercely grinding&#xD;
his teeth with rage.&#xD;
" I wish you were," returned the commissary,&#xD;
with an oath.&#xD;
FatherDavion wiped his eyes yet again, and&#xD;
essayed to speak ; but the sounds died away in&#xD;
his throat.&#xD;

"It can't be done," he managed to articulate,&#xD;
at length.&#xD;
"ngt it must be done !" exclaimed Pierre&#xD;
Moran, impatiertly, looking at the blushing&#xD;
Adelaide.&#xD;
" Of course it must," added Boisbriant, "and&#xD;
a fine affair it seems to be, if I'm any judge.&#xD;
Boys, hurrah again, while the old, gentleman&#xD;
clears his throat; he's got an extraordinary&#xD;
cold!"&#xD;
The old woods shook once more to the hearty&#xD;
cheers of the soldiers, and the triumphant yells&#xD;
of the warriors.&#xD;
By this timeFather Davion had succeeded in&#xD;
getting -his pipes tolerably clear, and didn't&#xD;
.break 'down but once or twice during the whole&#xD;
ceremony.&#xD;
Mutual' embraces and congratulations fol-&#xD;
loiwed, and not one of the happy party slept a&#xD;
wink that night.&#xD;
The next day they tet out on their return to&#xD;
New Orleans ; and though they were more than&#xD;
two days an the way, they all considered it a&#xD;
asant journey.&#xD;
s ubert was sent home to France by order of&#xD;
&#xD;
E ROVER.&#xD;
&#xD;
the governor, where he was deprived of his office,&#xD;
and otherwise disgraced. He never showed his&#xD;
face in the colony again.&#xD;
Lesage was first cashiered, and then impris-&#xD;
oned for a few months. He was afterwards shot&#xD;
by Ette-Actal, the renegade. Several'of the Ban-&#xD;
bara negroes were arrested and executed. The&#xD;
White Rover visited the different Indian tribes,&#xD;
and made peace among them by distributing&#xD;
presents, and making some concessions which&#xD;
they had insisted upon. The innocence of Henri&#xD;
was of course fully established.&#xD;
The renegade left off many of his vicious hab-&#xD;
its; and finally, by the influence of La Glori-&#xD;
euse, was again taken into favor by his people.&#xD;
We can add but little more. We take leave&#xD;
of our characters, leaving them happy and con-&#xD;
tented. We feel that it would be useless to&#xD;
swell longer upon the fortunes of Helen, and&#xD;
Adelaide, when united to such noble and gener-&#xD;
ous hearts.&#xD;
Truly grateful to the gentle readers who have&#xD;
followed us thus far, we sincerely hope they have&#xD;
been interested in the, fortunes of the WHITB&#xD;
Romn, and the fair maidens of Louisiana.&#xD;

TSE UNFINISHED WILL.&#xD;
BY SYLVANUS COBB, JR.&#xD;
&#xD;
SOLOMON VANWICK was an old man-a man&#xD;
who had weathered the storms and frosts of four-&#xD;
score years. His frame had become weakened,&#xD;
his health impaired, and his mind nervous and&#xD;
irritable ; but yet the same iron will that had&#xD;
marked his disposition in the prime of his man-&#xD;
hood, was not bent beneath the weight of age.&#xD;
The old man had had but one child--a son.&#xD;
That son had died, leaving an only daughter, so&#xD;
that Solomon Vanwick had but one living de-&#xD;
scendant, from himself, the fair Isabella, his&#xD;
grandchild. Vanwick was wealthy and proud,&#xD;
and among the branch relations of his house,&#xD;
who hung abbut him in hopes of golden remem-&#xD;
brance in his will, was Victor Waldamear, the&#xD;
son of the old nabob's sister.&#xD;
Old Vanwick was sitting in his large arm-&#xD;
chair ; near him stood Isabella, while at one of&#xD;
the high gothic windows stood Victor Walda-&#xD;
mear. Isabella, though her eyes were tearless,&#xD;
had, yet been weeping at the heart, but she&#xD;
trembled not, nor did she shrink before the&#xD;
stern gaze that was bent upon her.&#xD;
Isabella," said the old man, while a mean-&#xD;
ing frown darkened his wrinkled face, " this&#xD;
Alfred Norcross is not the man for your hus-&#xD;
'band. Do you understand me ?"&#xD;
"I understand what you say, grandfather,&#xD;
but I think you can know little of the man of&#xD;
&#xD;
whom you speak. If you did, you would honor&#xD;
him for his virtues."&#xD;
" When I say that Norcross is not the man&#xD;
for your husband, I mean it !" said the old man;&#xD;
" so from henceforth you will see him no more."&#xD;
" No, no, my dear grandfather," exclaimed&#xD;
Isabella, with an imploring look and tole, "you&#xD;
will not persist in that. You will not thus&#xD;
crush me beneath your displeasure."&#xD;
"Not if you obey me.".&#xD;
" But Alfred is the son of my father's dearest&#xD;
friend."&#xD;
"Yes," returned Vanwick, with bitterness,&#xD;
" and your father's friend was my enemy."&#xD;
" And will you, because thdre was an unhappy&#xD;
difference between yourself and the' elder Nor-&#xD;
cross, now keep that enmity alive against the&#xD;
unoffending son ?"&#xD;
"Silence, girl! Let me hear no more of this.&#xD;
What I have said is said, and it shall never&#xD;
recalled."&#xD;
" Sir," said Isabella, while an inward struggle&#xD;
to keep downs her rising emotions gave a pen-&#xD;
liar tremulousness to her tone, "you are can od&#xD;
man, and your days on earth are-short,; bitt&#xD;
little joy of this life is left for you, whie i p&#xD;
young, and all of active life is before ine. The&#xD;
steps which I take now will give color to my..&#xD;
future, and be that future long "r short, it must&#xD;

be made happy or miserable according as my&#xD;
steps are turned. My heart I have given to&#xD;
Alfred Norcross; in his keeping have I placed&#xD;
my purest affections, and I know that he is wor-&#xD;
thy of the trust. This union of our young&#xD;
hearts is the basis of all our joy in theefuture,&#xD;
and I cannot feel that even you have the right&#xD;
to rend it in sunder."&#xD;
" Child, do you prate to me of right ?" uttered&#xD;
the old man. " Young Norcross shall never&#xD;
touch one farthing of my money. You shall&#xD;
not marry him, and if he dares again-"&#xD;
"cHold1" interrupted Isabella, while a strong&#xD;
calmness seemed to support her, " whatever you1&#xD;
have to say against me, I am ready to hear ; but&#xD;
speak not against Alfred Norcross, for he is my1&#xD;
husband!"&#xD;
" Your husband !" reiterated old Vanwick,&#xD;
grasping the arms of his -chair with his bony&#xD;
'hands. "Jsebella, speak that word again !" .&#xD;
"Alfred Norcross is my husband !" pro-&#xD;
nounced the fair girl,.in a firm tone.I&#xD;
" Then," returned the old man, asp his face&#xD;
grow livid and his teeth grated together, "go&#xD;
and live with your husband. From henceforth&#xD;
you arenothing to me. I have forgotten you-  1&#xD;
your image is wrenched from my heart. Cross&#xD;
not my.~threshold again. Go ! you are discarded, f&#xD;
a'forever! '&#xD;
"But, my grandfather-"b&#xD;
"Sience, miscreant ! Out of my house, and e&#xD;
neve, let me set eyes upon you again !"   r&#xD;
"Then'farewell, and may -Heaven yet pour t&#xD;
the"balm of. forgiveness o'er your soul," said Is-&#xD;
abella, as she half turned away; but ere she t&#xD;
vent, she gazed once' more into his passion-- i&#xD;
wrought face, and with a starting Zgr she h&#xD;
continued:     .lc&#xD;
'todmoney, grandfather, I never coveted, s&#xD;
hut your love Iwould fain retain. Your prop- t]&#xD;
Y   ftymay go to' those who hang about you for&#xD;
#, possession, but your old heart's affections s:&#xD;
Hijl 'findno better resting-place than in the I&#xD;
bosom of your grandchild, for there, at least, c&#xD;
ywill be reciprocated."&#xD;
OldSolomon Vanwick made no reply, but k&#xD;
h ie yet he gaxed at the light form of his grand-&#xD;
cd, she passed out from the room. As the&#xD;
Qor-closed behind he-, a look of almost fiend= ti&#xD;
like exulation rested upon the 'face of Victor se&#xD;
ear, and he turned his eyes away from&#xD;
Is  a lesthis real feelings might be seen. t&#xD;
eu iinutes passed: away, dining which time i&#xD;
th  ia fa sat with his hands grasped firmly pi&#xD;
&#xD;
upon the arms of his chair, while a fierce rage&#xD;
seemed rankling in his bosom ; but at length&#xD;
his feelings settled to a sort of cold, iron deter-&#xD;
mination, and turning towards his nephew, he&#xD;
said :&#xD;
" Victor, I think she's been ungrateful to me."&#xD;
"Most ungrateful," returned Victor, in a&#xD;
fawning, pharisaic tone. " Her ingratitude to&#xD;
one so kind and generous as yourself, was to&#xD;
me as unexpected as it was bewildering. But,&#xD;
my dear uncle, you may yet somewhat relent&#xD;
towards her, for though young Norcross is-un-&#xD;
worthy of your esteem, yet Isabella may have&#xD;
been deceived."&#xD;
" Deceived !" exclaimed the old man, again&#xD;
bursting into a passion. "It's me that's been&#xD;
deceived! Most grossly has she deceived me.&#xD;
No, no, Victor, you cannot palliate her offence.&#xD;
I have discarded her-disavowed her. Not a&#xD;
penny of my property shall she ever touch."&#xD;
Again Victor Waldamear turned away to&#xD;
hide the glow of exultation that suffused his&#xD;
countenance.&#xD;
"Dear uncle," he said, at length, in a tone so&#xD;
studied and hypocritical that any but a rage-.&#xD;
blinded old man might have seen it, "let me&#xD;
advise you to wait awhile ere you alter your will;&#xD;
for though Isabella has disgraced you by her&#xD;
marriage, as well as forfeited your kindness by&#xD;
her reckless disregard of all your desires-and&#xD;
ven though she has virtuallycast herself off by&#xD;
ruthlessly trampling on your love and solici-&#xD;
ude, yet-"&#xD;
" Peace, peace, Victor !" interrupted the old&#xD;
nan, with increased emotion, "Nothing, noth-&#xD;
ng shall turn me. I know you would plead for&#xD;
her, but even with your pleading, you cannot&#xD;
ose sight of'her utter unworthiness. My deci-&#xD;
ion is made. Here, take this key and unlock&#xD;
he left department of that old cabinet."&#xD;
Victor Waldamear stepped to the old man's&#xD;
ide, and with a trembling hand he took the key.&#xD;
t was placed in the lock, and the quaintly&#xD;
arved door was opened.&#xD;
" Do you see th t deep drawer, with a small&#xD;
ey in its lock asked the old man.&#xD;
" Yes, sir," returned the nephew.&#xD;
" Open it. Within you will see a parchment&#xD;
ed with a blue ribbon, and bearing a heavy&#xD;
cal. Bring it to ie."&#xD;
Victor found the document, and he handed it ' ;&#xD;
o his uncle; then, at an 'order from! the old&#xD;
aan, he rang for a servant, who, when he  app&#xD;
eared, was requested to bring a lighted taper * .&#xD;
&#xD;
Ere long the taper was brought, and after&#xD;
the servant had withdrawn, Vanwick tore off the&#xD;
seal and ribbon from the roll he held, and as he&#xD;
opened it, Victor's eyes rested upon his uncle's&#xD;
will! With features again set in their firm,,&#xD;
iron mould, the old man raised the parchment&#xD;
to the blaze of the taper. The compact vellum&#xD;
began to hiss and crackle in the flame, and as it,&#xD;
-crisped and rolled in the heat, it fell in charred&#xD;
masses upon the table. Slowly it burned, but&#xD;
yet line after line of its inky import became an-&#xD;
nihilated, and at length the work of destruction&#xD;
was complete. Old Vanwick's will was no&#xD;
more.&#xD;
Thus far had Victor Waldamear triumphed.&#xD;
He had succeeded in poisoning the old man's&#xD;
mind against his grandchild, by the most subtle&#xD;
arts. He had not dared to directly attack the&#xD;
name of Isabella, but he had most basely tra-&#xD;
duced the fair fame of Alfred Norcross, and by&#xD;
a continuous siege of petty thrusts and stabs at&#xD;
the cords of affection that bound the old man&#xD;
to his son's daughter, he had at length seen the&#xD;
estrangement complete. But the game was not-&#xD;
yet won, for without a will, Isabella was the di-&#xD;
rect lineal -heir. A few will must be made, and&#xD;
to this end, and that he might be the heir, Vic-&#xD;
tor Waldamear determined to set himself at&#xD;
work. He was now Vanwick's sole confidant,&#xD;
and he held no doubts of his success. Already&#xD;
the broad lands and the bright gold of his uncle&#xD;
seemed his own, and not a pang of remorse&#xD;
reached his heart, as he thought of the poor, in-&#xD;
nocent being whom he had so foully wronged&#xD;
out of her birthright.&#xD;
Isabella was not entirely happy when she&#xD;
turned her steps towards the dwelling which her&#xD;
husband had procured, nor was she really sad.&#xD;
The knowledge that she had been utterly dis-&#xD;
carded by her grandfather was a source of sqr-&#xD;
row, for she had loved the old man well; but&#xD;
the thought that she had a husband who loved&#xD;
her cheered her on, and when at length she&#xD;
found herself clasped to that husband's bosom,&#xD;
the clouds were all rolled away, and she smiled&#xD;
in joy.&#xD;
"Alfred," said she, "here in this humble cot&#xD;
we must make our home, for my grandfather&#xD;
has forbidden me ever to enter his dwelling&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"Then he has disinherited you?"&#xD;
" Yes, and he disowns me."&#xD;
"6Then," said Alfred, while his fine features&#xD;
&#xD;
THE UNFINISHED WILL.&#xD;
&#xD;
were lighted up by a noble pride, and he clasped&#xD;
his young wife more closely to his bosom, " we&#xD;
will show him how independent we can be. I&#xD;
am sorry that he still clings to his dislike of me,&#xD;
but if I live he shall yet see that I bear him no&#xD;
maice'in return. When my father urged your&#xD;
father into that unfortunate speculation by&#xD;
which they both were ruined, he thought to do&#xD;
him a pecuniary benefit, but God ruled it other-&#xD;
wise. Now, if Mr. Vanwick will still hunt me&#xD;
down for the result of my father's doings, then&#xD;
he is at liberty so to do ; and for my poverty,&#xD;
too, I suppose he hates me ; but look up, dear-&#xD;
est Isabiella ; with my pencil I can yet carve out&#xD;
a fortune, or at least a comfortable means of&#xD;
sustenance. You do not mourn for the loss of&#xD;
your grandfather's estate, Isabella ?"&#xD;
"No, no, Alfred, I coveted it not; nor do I&#xD;
miss a thing I never possessed. One source of&#xD;
regret alone is mine-I have loved my grand-&#xD;
father, and I am sorry that he appreciates it&#xD;
not."&#xD;
"Your grandfather has not come to this con-&#xD;
clusion without some assistance from another&#xD;
quarter," said Alfred, with a spice of bitterness&#xD;
in his manner. " Victor Waldamear has had a&#xD;
hand in it all. His eyes have long been opened&#xD;
.to the possession of old Vanwick's property,&#xD;
and thus has his grasping ambition .begun to&#xD;
reach its object."&#xD;
"You speak truly, Alfred. But let us think&#xD;
no more about it. We can make our home&#xD;
happy without my grandfather's money, and if&#xD;
Victor succeeds in gaining the estate, I shall&#xD;
not envy him his possession."&#xD;
Within the apartment where the young couple&#xD;
stood, there was an easel, upon whichwas an&#xD;
unfinished landscape ; but yet enough had been&#xD;
placed upon the canvass to show that the-hand&#xD;
that had done it, carried a bold and easy pencil.&#xD;
The coloring was true to nature, and the soft&#xD;
blending of the lights and shades' betrayed an&#xD;
artistic taste and skill. Albert Norcross was a&#xD;
fair painter, and already had he engaged work&#xD;
enough to more than support him through the&#xD;
year, and he was Sure of his money as fast as he&#xD;
could turn off his pictures. As Isabella last&#xD;
spoke, her husband clasped her once mote to&#xD;
his bosom, and then imprinting a kiss upon her&#xD;
fair brow, he seated himself at his easel.&#xD;
Poor Isabella ! As she stood and gazed upon&#xD;
her husband as he now plied his brush, she&#xD;
dreamed not that the sweet flowers she 'hid&#xD;
culled could be ariPed with thorns. In the in-&#xD;

nocence of her love, she had not thought of the&#xD;
future, or if she had, 'twas only as that love had&#xD;
pictured it. Alfred, too, looked only through&#xD;
the eyes of love, and he never once thought of&#xD;
the sterner realities that sometimes go to make&#xD;
up the counts of life.&#xD;
At the end of a week the young artist had&#xD;
fInished his picture, and, according to promise,&#xD;
he prepared to set forth for the dwelling of its&#xD;
purchaser. The man for whom he had painted&#xD;
it, lived some: ten miles distant, and having&#xD;
kissed his pretty wife, he took the product of&#xD;
his labor under his arm and started off. The&#xD;
forenoon was well advanced when he left his{&#xD;
dwelling, but he promised to be back before&#xD;
dark, and Isabella smiled as she bade him God&#xD;
speed.&#xD;
Isabella sang and played the hours away, till&#xD;
the afternoon drew towards its close, and then&#xD;
she seated herself in the small flower-garden to&#xD;
watch for the return of her husband. An hour&#xD;
passed away, and she arose from her seat and&#xD;
walked around the garden,-then she went out&#xD;
into the road and looked off in the direction&#xD;
in which her husband would come ; but she&#xD;
spw him not, and once more she resumed her&#xD;
Oeat, Half an hour more passed, And a heavy,&#xD;
blackcloud, which Isabella had not before no-&#xD;
ticed,came lowering about her, and ere long the&#xD;
e=avy rain-drops began to fall.  The young&#xD;
wife reluctantly left her seat in the garden, and&#xD;
sought refuge in the house ; but hardly had she&#xD;
gained it ere the rain, began to fall faster, and&#xD;
tfal gusts swept up from the cloudyladen hori-&#xD;
zon. The dust and dry leaves danced in the&#xD;
airrthe wind whistled louder, and a curtain of&#xD;
almost impenetrable blackness was drawn over&#xD;
the earth. Isabella; peered forth into the dark-&#xD;
nessand when she could no longer see even&#xD;
the trees that surrounded her dwelling, she&#xD;
shrank back from the window and sank upon a&#xD;
stool near h husband's easel.&#xD;
Siiwly and heavily wore away another hour.&#xD;
Isiabela arose from her stool and went to the&#xD;
ddswe  The rain was fallingtn' torrents, and&#xD;
the v~vid lightning had begun to dance in the&#xD;
heavens.  Peal after peal of thunder.roared&#xD;
rl1in the lightning-tracked space, and'at every&#xD;
shockthe poor young wife heart sank lower&#xD;
_nd&amp;amp;lower in her bosom. 'once she opened the&#xD;
toer, and. would have rushed forth into the&#xD;
rkness, but she -qnailed before - the raging&#xD;
normgiant, and-shrank trembling hack.:&#xD;
Already had the disconsolate woman's mind&#xD;
&#xD;
SHED WILL.&#xD;
&#xD;
begun to waver beneath its load of fearful&#xD;
doubt, when she thought she detected the&#xD;
sound of a heavy footfall without. She sprang&#xD;
towards the door, threw it open, and in a mo-&#xD;
ment more her husband caught her in his arms;&#xD;
she did not rest her weight upon him, however,&#xD;
for in a moment she realized that he trembled&#xD;
with weakness, and taking him fondly by the&#xD;
arm, she led him to a seat.&#xD;
Alfrpd was wet to the skin, and his limbs&#xD;
were cold and shivering, and though he smiled&#xD;
in answer to his wife's earnest inquiries, yet his&#xD;
smiles were weak and sickly, and they dwelt&#xD;
only for a moment upon the surface of his&#xD;
countenance, and then faded away before the&#xD;
power of pain and almost utter exhaustion.&#xD;
He explained to his wife that he had been&#xD;
obliged to wait some time Jfor his patron, and&#xD;
that in half an hour after he started on his way&#xD;
home, he was overtaken. by the storm. The&#xD;
utter darkness enveloped the path with an im-&#xD;
penetrable pall, and he had been obliged almost&#xD;
literally to feel out his course. Often had he&#xD;
fallen over the undistinguishable obstacles that&#xD;
lay in the road, and had the distance been many&#xD;
rods further, he could not have dragged his ex-&#xD;
hausted limbs to his home.&#xD;
With fearful forebodings, Isab'ella assisted her&#xD;
husband to his bed, for. his face was already,&#xD;
flushed with a burning glow, his breath was hot,&#xD;
and his pulse beat with a feverish quickness.&#xD;
She watched by his side all night, and -on the&#xD;
next morning a raging fever had set in. One&#xD;
of the neighbor's children was sent for a physi-&#xD;
cian, and when he arrived, he pronounced Alfred&#xD;
to be under the influence of a most malignant&#xD;
fever; at the same time assuring Isabella that&#xD;
the case of her husband was one of extreme .&#xD;
doubt. He ministered, however, for the relief&#xD;
of the patient, and promised. to call again on&#xD;
the morrow.&#xD;
A month passed away, and Alfred had not&#xD;
yet left his sick bed, though the fearful crisis&#xD;
had passed and he was fast recovering. The&#xD;
physician had discontinued his daily visits, hav-&#xD;
ing left orders for the patient's diet, with some&#xD;
simple restoratives, and the young painter had&#xD;
begun to hope again, Isabella was sitting by&#xD;
the side of her husband's bed, and a tear which&#xD;
she could not repress, stole down her pale&#xD;
cheek.&#xD;
"Isabella," faintly articulated the sick man,&#xD;
" what means that tear ?"-&#xD;
"'Tia nothing, Albert."&#xD;
&#xD;
TIE UNFINI&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Tis something, Isabella, for that sad look&#xD;
which -accompanies it, speaks to me of some-&#xD;
thing more than fatigue. Come, keep no secrets&#xD;
from me. What has happened ?"&#xD;
"Albert," returned the fond wife, in a tremu-&#xD;
lous tone, " I know not why I should keep it&#xD;
from you, for you must soon know it. But you&#xD;
will not suffer it to prey upon your mind, my&#xD;
husband ?"            '&#xD;
"Speak, Isabella. Tell me all, and if you&#xD;
can bear up under it, I shall not fall beneath its&#xD;
knowledge."&#xD;
" Then, Albert, we are-are-"&#xD;
"Go on, my wife."&#xD;
"We are penniless ! no food, no fuel, and no&#xD;
means of procuring them !"&#xD;
"Penniless !" murmured the young man, gaz-&#xD;
ing half vacantly into the face of his wife. " I&#xD;
had thought not of that. Penniless, and, alas !&#xD;
how debt, too, must have crept upon us !'"&#xD;
" No, no, Alfred; thank God, we are not in&#xD;
debt."&#xD;
"Tot in debt, Isabella ? What can have sus-&#xD;
tained us thus'far ? Surely, my little stock of&#xD;
money could not have gone so far."&#xD;
"I have paid it all, my husband, but I can&#xD;
pay no more."&#xD;
'You told me not that you had money,&#xD;
Isabella.?'&#xD;
"1I had jewelry,}Albert."&#xD;
"0, God! tnd has it come to this ?" bitterly&#xD;
cried the poor man, as he placed his emaciated&#xD;
hand upon his throbbing brow. " Would to&#xD;
heaven that I might have suffered this alone ;&#xD;
but that you, you, Isabella, should be thus&#xD;
dragged into misery with me, is insupportable.&#xD;
0, why did you become my wife ?"&#xD;
"Alfred," uttered the wife, while the tears&#xD;
coursed faster down her checks, " do not add to&#xD;
what we already suffer. I can bear up under all&#xD;
but such unkindness, for 'tis unkind thus to&#xD;
speak of our united love. But, my husband,&#xD;
there is one more source of hope."&#xD;
 "And that-"-&#xD;
" Is to seek my grandfather."&#xD;
"0, Isabella, my proud heart shrinks from&#xD;
such a course. You would only be spurned&#xD;
from his door, and treated with cold-hearted&#xD;
indignity and reproach. This would make our&#xD;
misery greater&#xD;
"Then let him spi ume. .I will at least see&#xD;
him and tell him how we.suler. He was my&#xD;
father's father, and he will-he must, have some&#xD;
compasion."&#xD;
&#xD;
SHED WILL.                             99&#xD;
" Then he would have shown it ere this."&#xD;
"He may not have known our situation."&#xD;
" He must have heard of my sickness."&#xD;
"Ay, but he cannot know how we now suf-&#xD;
fer. Yes, Alfred, I will go to him, and if he&#xD;
spurns me, we can but suffer on."&#xD;
The sick man gazed into the face of his wife,&#xD;
but he spoke no further. The thought that his&#xD;
Isabella must go to beg for him harrowed up&#xD;
his soul with an anguish more painful 'than&#xD;
the disease under which he had suffered.&#xD;
Since Isabella had been banished from his&#xD;
house, old Solomon Vanwick had been growing'&#xD;
moody and morose. He had entertained no&#xD;
thought of recalling' her, nor had. he swerved&#xD;
one grain, from his resolution of utterly disin-&#xD;
heriting her ; but yet he missed her sweet smile&#xD;
and her merry song, and no art of Victor Wal-&#xD;
damear's could make him glad. The old man,&#xD;
however, would not own, even to himself, that&#xD;
'twas Isabella's absence that made him sad ; he&#xD;
rather persuaded himself that 'twas the :sin of&#xD;
ingratitude she had committed, and in this opin-&#xD;
ion Victor endeavored to strengthen him. Van-&#xD;
wick's health was evidently failing, and his-&#xD;
scheming nephew began to fear that he would&#xD;
die without making another will; but at length&#xD;
the old man was brought to the point and a.&#xD;
notary was sent for. He spoke of .his grande&#xD;
daughter, but Victor kept strict watch that the&#xD;
poison failed not in its work upon his mind&#xD;
and whenever some spark of paternal kindness&#xD;
would for a moment struggle to throw its beams,&#xD;
over his bosom, the nephew would dash it out&#xD;
with a cold stream of insinuating slander.&#xD;
Within the old man's library sat Victor Wal-&#xD;
damear and the notary. Vanwick was there,&#xD;
and he dictated to the official while the new will'&#xD;
was being made. With the exception of a few'&#xD;
hundreds, which were bequeathed to some of&#xD;
the old servants, the whole vast estate was made&#xD;
over to Victor. The young man's eyes sparkled&#xD;
as he heard the orders given which were to make&#xD;
him the sole heir, and he dared not hold up his&#xD;
head lest his too palpable emotions should be&#xD;
seen.&#xD;
"That is all," said the old man, as hegave,&#xD;
the last clause of the will.s&#xD;
" And have you nothing for your grandchild,&#xD;
the gentle IsabellaP asked the notary, with&#xD;
considerable surprise.&#xD;
" Isabella, sir, has, by her ungrateful conduct,&#xD;
alienated herself," returned Victor, quickly, lest,'&#xD;
if time were given, his uncle might relent.&#xD;
&#xD;
:&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7629-00000049"/>&#xD;
00  THEI1 UITINISHED WILL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mr. Vanwick," continued the notary, seem-&#xD;
ing to-take-little notice of what'the nephew had&#xD;
said, "by law, without. a will, Isabella is your&#xD;
sole'heir-the daughter-the only child of your&#xD;
own only son. Is it your firm intent that she&#xD;
be thus cut off" ' -"&#xD;
"I tell thee yes,-old man," said Victor.&#xD;
The notary noticed not the young speaker,&#xD;
but he kept-his eyes riveted upon the face of&#xD;
S9lomon'Vanwick.&#xD;
It is, it is," at length murmured the old&#xD;
man, in. a slightly faltering voice. "She has&#xD;
been very unkind, very ungrteful to me, and&#xD;
anwick hesitated, and for a moment Victor&#xD;
trembled, but his assurance came quickly to his&#xD;
aid, and he said:&#xD;
"My uncle would not thus have cut her off,&#xD;
but that;young Norcross stood ready .to grasp&#xD;
his money. Iso his hands Vanwick desires not&#xD;
that his property should fall; but, if at any time&#xD;
Isabela needs. assistance, or when I can see&#xD;
signs of her repentance, I shall assist her, though&#xD;
I trust that long years will yet pass ere this last&#xD;
testament of my dear uncle's will need to be&#xD;
administered, and he himself may yet see what&#xD;
the girl deserves."&#xD;
Young:Waldamear spoke this with the most&#xD;
hypoeritical sycophancy ; bnt it seemed to revive&#xD;
the drooping purposes of the old man, for with&#xD;
Suiek, nervous movement, he put forth his&#xD;
hndsaying, as hedid so :&#xD;
"!he will is as I wish it. Give it to me, sir,&#xD;
an4let me signit. I said it,-I gave her warn-&#xD;
wain-dld her she was discarded forever.&#xD;
'Ta. heitraoh fault."&#xD;
Old Vitnwick :spread the parchment out be.&#xD;
fore him ,nd after running his eyes over it, he&#xD;
seized the pen and dipped it into the inkstand.'&#xD;
Th e was a nervous twitching about the mus-&#xD;
desotlhis face, and a strange, lustrous fire shot&#xD;
forth;from  his eyes.  The pen had not yet&#xD;
touched the document.&#xD;
igna 1ign 1" whispered Victor, as he sprang&#xD;
to the old man's side. "Here-here is the place !"&#xD;
T'Yes, =Iwill sign it,",.murmured Vanwick.&#xD;
'Tse isnot worthy ; she shall not touch a penny&#xD;
o ie.;, said it, and I must not swerve."&#xD;
Thsd siign! sign 1"&#xD;
: i- V Ehark! Dd I not hear a voice ?" ut-&#xD;
'     teredtheold inan, still grasping the pen, and&#xD;
raisinP Ms hand. "'Twas her voice! 'Twas&#xD;

" " No, xio, she has forgotten you, my dear in-&#xD;
ole," nrged' Victor, while the sweat began tol&#xD;
stanid uphn hisibrow. :" Sign the will! Sign !"&#xD;
At that moment the door of the apartments&#xD;
was thrown 'open; and Isabella, all pale andi&#xD;
trembli g, erteed the ,room. Her eyes caught&#xD;
the scene before her, but she dwelt upon none&#xD;
save her gpandfathei' and 9wards him she east&#xD;
a1lo9k of imploring tearfulaony. A moment&#xD;
the old man gazed upon the Itorm of his grand.&#xD;
chiud, then his lips trembled ; the fire of his eye&#xD;
ehstngetdto a still-stranger glow, a tear started&#xD;
f    uohi slongigray eyelashes, and slightly&#xD;
rasyngis hands toward where she stood, he&#xD;
~nrmured:                                 1&#xD;
-~  ~'  .THE&#xD;
&#xD;
"Isabella-my child-forgive your poor old&#xD;
grandfather. I forgot the warm love of your&#xD;
young heart; but let all be forgotten--forgiven.&#xD;
You have come back to-you are-you are-&#xD;
Isabella. Victor-take away this black curtain-&#xD;
it shuts heroutt. Take it away-it makes all dark !"&#xD;
"The will! Sign'it ! sign it !" gasped the&#xD;
nephew, aste laid his touch upon the hand that&#xD;
still held the inked pen.&#xD;
That hand rested upon the table, and it&#xD;
moved not. It still clutched the pen, but it&#xD;
made' no motion towards the, unfinished will.&#xD;
The old man's eyes were still fixed upon his&#xD;
grandchild, but their fire was gone, and they&#xD;
looked cold and glassy. The notary stepped&#xD;
forward and raised Vanwick's hand from the&#xD;
table, but it fell' back with- a dull, leaden mo-&#xD;
.tion, and the unused pen fell from its grasp.&#xD;
Solomon Vanwick was dead !&#xD;
Victor Waldamear shrank back pale and&#xD;
trembling from the scene ; he dared not speak,&#xD;
for in the presence of, the deadehis conscience&#xD;
shook off its slay folds and stung him. Isabella&#xD;
sprang forward and threw 'her arms about the&#xD;
neck of. er-.grandfather's corpse. She kissed&#xD;
the marble brow, she bathed 'the pale face with&#xD;
her tears, and then turning her eyes towards&#xD;
the notary, she murmured:&#xD;
" He forgave me ! He forgave me ere be&#xD;
died! You heard him, sir, did you not? ie&#xD;
loved me-he loved me--I ask no more."&#xD;
*     *    *     *    *        *&#xD;
" Mr. Waldamear," said the old notary, after&#xD;
the party had withdrawn from the study, "hence-&#xD;
forth you' must regard Isabella as the ruler of&#xD;
this place. Whatever may have been your&#xD;
aims, or what schemes you may have used to&#xD;
attain them, you yourself best know ; but you&#xD;
must now be aware that there is nothing here&#xD;
for your ambition to feed upon further. -That&#xD;
will Which was to have robbed a child of her&#xD;
birthright is yet unfinished, and he who alone&#xD;
could have done it is now no more on earth. A&#xD;
wise Hand held him back from the fatal deed,&#xD;
and even his own hand shrank from it. And&#xD;
now," the old man continued, turning to Isa-&#xD;
bella, "let the servants see that nothing is trou-&#xD;
bled till my friends arrive to settle the estate.&#xD;
The funeral may, if you choose, be at your own&#xD;
arrangement, or I will take its- charge upon&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
I need not tell how the servants sneered at&#xD;
Victor Waldamear, when he went disappointed&#xD;
and disgraced away from the dwelling where&#xD;
his schemings had failed, nor need I tell'how&#xD;
the servants laughed and cried by turns when&#xD;
they knew that their young mistress was re-&#xD;
stored to them. Isabella mourned for her grand-&#xD;
sire, but yet the smiles of joy began soon to&#xD;
bloom around her.   Her dear husband was&#xD;
restored to health-the wealth of her father's&#xD;
house was hersf and the deadly shafts of the&#xD;
traducer had fallen powerless and harmless&#xD;
about her. They had, indeed, caused her some&#xD;
hours of anguish, but now they had fallen back-&#xD;
upon the evil man who had sent them forth,&#xD;
and they stung him, and the poison he had in-&#xD;
tended for others, fell to his own portion.&#xD;
