IN WHICH THE HERO MAKES RIs ROW 'O THE ,READER.&#xD;

- IT was night on the western prairies, and the&#xD;

that if his company would not be considered&#xD;
particularly disagreeable, he would venture to&#xD;
take- a seat by the fire, which seemed to him&#xD;
very cheerful and inviting.&#xD;
The individual who had styled himself Ben&#xD;
Brion, replied that he was at liberty to please&#xD;
himself in that respect, though he fancied that a&#xD;
stuffed chair, or a feather bed, would agree bet-&#xD;
ter with his constitution than any accommoda-&#xD;
tion he could offer. The youth answered to the&#xD;
effect that he was not fastidious ; that a blazing&#xD;
fire would suffice for a night so serene and tran-&#xD;
quil. He seated him elf,;pl eadtii 'ifle i the;&#xD;
ground beside hire,  d n ead of tip  g his&#xD;
attention to Bridof,'e ile  his study of the&#xD;
heavens with an abstracted air.&#xD;
At first, Brion scarcely deigned to notice the&#xD;
stripling ; but presently condescended to honor&#xD;
him with furtive glances, which, judging by the&#xD;
expression of his features, did not ineease -his&#xD;
esteem for his visitor. He obviously considered&#xD;
him too poor in experience to be entitled to an*y&#xD;
considerable share of a'tteition frn one who&#xD;
had grown ripe in adventure, and won his&#xD;

&#xD;
may be imagined,-because opposition was then&#xD;
raging with great bitterness, aggravated by mu-&#xD;
tual acts of hostility. It was a very important&#xD;
season for those who were ambitious, to profit&#xD;
by the hunter's craft. It was early in May, and&#xD;
the trapping campaign was about to open. The&#xD;
rival associations were hurrying to the rivers&#xD;
and lakes where game, abounded, each nervously&#xD;
anxious to outstrip the other, and obtain all the&#xD;
advantages of a choice of ground ; and with&#xD;
that object in view took every conceivable means&#xD;
to epnceal their oap  ovements, and deceive&#xD;
and ' rard the 'po ite' t rest.&#xD;

days in advance. Being made acquainted with&#xD;
these particulars, the reader will be able to form&#xD;
a toldrahly correct idea of the trapper's position,&#xD;
and the-train of thoughts the appearance of the&#xD;
youth, under such circumstances, would be like-&#xD;
ly to awaken. We 'must do him the justice to&#xD;
remark that he was not innately inclined to be&#xD;
discouute9us r .suspicious ; but lng experience&#xD;
in the ways ad ,elps of aptgopistic parties,&#xD;
had rendered ig Jeeply awake to strategy an4&#xD;

to .give go petty o ecsions and grow stronger ;;&#xD;
and possibly it was thus witi the trapper. He&#xD;

ness. Some sound had reached him to excite&#xD;
his fears or curiosity, and put him on the alert.&#xD;
"Faithful creature !" mused Brion. "Expe,&#xD;
rience has quickened his . senses, and made him&#xD;
littlerinferior to reasoning beings."&#xD;
The partisan (the leaders of those enterprises&#xD;
werefhus call) awaked the trapper and related&#xD;
what had pe  rad.: Buckeye stirred the fire,&#xD;
took a bite of tobacco, rubbed his forehead, and&#xD;
gave signs of uneasiness.&#xD;
"There's a great difference in circumstances,"&#xD;
quoth he, sagely. " Some things are easy to&#xD;
explain, and ,omue isn't."&#xD;
When he,had expressed thissentimnent, he&#xD;
ained a jet of dark colored extract at a blazing&#xD;
brang., "lash,' hearing his master's -well-&#xD;
known, voice, came up and placed his nose on&#xD;
his shoulder, as.if soliciting companionship.,&#xD;
"The cretur knows me, stranger, and is rest-:.&#xD;
less, wh'en I'm a good way off. We couldn't&#xD;
part, Flash and I couldn't. 'Twould be a sorry&#xD;
day for both of us if he should change owners.&#xD;
But I hope that'll never be. 'Twould break his&#xD;
heart'to have a redskin back -him. But that's&#xD;
nothing to 'do with the subject; and as I said&#xD;
afogo, in different ,wgtrds, some matters are,&#xD;
mighty mysterious, and hard to get at under--&#xD;
standingly.; There's strange characters in this&#xD;
wild kentry, and one don't allers know: what's&#xD;
arter him. The lateral reptiles of the sile have&#xD;
a heap of epunin', and it's, never safe to ,het&#xD;
both eyes at night.. We're tracked; that's evi-&#xD;
dent enough; but by whom, is another question.&#xD;
There's .danger st our backs, but which of us&#xD;
two is spoe ffr, I can't say.. I'll tell yob more&#xD;
about it artery we've passed fort-Laramie ; that&#xD;
is, if we both should be alive then.";&#xD;
"It wold- be wellto ;move off, leaving our,&#xD;
fire burning, I suppose," returned Brio. "It&#xD;
is opr'dutyto be reasonably cautious and careft&#xD;
of life. ,There's a scriptural injunction -laid,&#xD;
upon-us togb ,ise as serpents."&#xD;
"If a paron had said that it couldn't have&#xD;
beenmore 'tothe'pint. I knw of a very quiet&#xD;

&#xD;
PATE.&#xD;
where they had anticipated. passing an undis-&#xD;
turbed night, was soon fare behind. The 'spot&#xD;
referred to by Buckeye proved a fitting -place&#xD;
for their purpose, being sheltered by large rocks&#xD;
and trees, and hemmed in by a crescent-shaped'&#xD;
bend in the river.&#xD;
Brion felt at home. The wide sky arching&#xD;
over him in ,unveiled beauty, with its starry&#xD;
hosts ; the spreading prairies, the, distant moun-&#xD;
tains, the running waters and fluttering leaves,&#xD;
were things that had voices, and addressed him&#xD;
with pleasant language. The- mountaineer was&#xD;
entirely satisfied with his mode of life. . He felt&#xD;
no desire to be other than he was. There was a,&#xD;
charm (for him) .in the atmosphere of the wil-'&#xD;
derness ; while the certainty .of danger added&#xD;
new zest, making him moreis love with his call-&#xD;
ing. Like Buckeye, he had been a free trapper,&#xD;
but the strong inducement held out to him by&#xD;
the American Fur Company had (after consid-&#xD;
erable hesitation and rather against his inde-&#xD;
pendent predilections) caused him to accept the&#xD;
post of " partisan," or leader of the enterprise.&#xD;
'He knew it was a trying and difficult position,,&#xD;
but trusted that he should be able by his experi-&#xD;
encejn trapping and hunting to give satisfaction&#xD;
to all concerned.&#xD;
When he resumed his way on the ensuing&#xD;
morning, the ;glowing stories,.of Buckeye, con-&#xD;
cerning the pleasures, and excitement of a free&#xD;
trapper's existence, made him half regret his&#xD;
engagement. Before noon he overtook the band,&#xD;
consisting of about .seventy-five men, amply&#xD;
provided with pack horses and mules._&#xD;
"I want no sich creturs as them," said Buck-&#xD;
eye ppinting to the latter-with.a contemptuous&#xD;
expression. -"-And as-for baggage, a real trap--&#xD;
per needs nothin' but his gun, huntin' knife and&#xD;
traps. Them men are slaves to their mules and&#xD;
packs., :No, no! !Icouldnft think of ,aich a'life,!&#xD;

sky for -my roof,;and the -prairie for my floo*,&#xD;
with nobody:to dictate what I shall or sha'n't.&#xD;
do, and I ask no more."&#xD;
With this pithyopitonte;of his ,sentiments,&#xD;
Buckeye. shputed "Hi I hi !" performed some&#xD;

ter ; but which were borne by the latter with&#xD;
perfect equanimity.,&#xD;
We cannot here make the reader acquainted&#xD;
with the various individuals of which the band&#xD;
was composed. There were French and half-&#xD;
breeds,: a few of Mexican origin, the greater&#xD;
number being Americans from frontier towns.&#xD;
There was Also a Texan adventurer, a Kentuck&#xD;
ian, aVirginian, and a young fellow from Mas-&#xD;
sachusetts. Many were veteran trappers, while&#xD;
some were fresh on the prairies, unpractised: in&#xD;
the arts and expedients of hunter life. . Thus&#xD;
far on their march all had gone well. The In-&#xD;
dians had not molested them, and grass being&#xD;
abundant, the horses and mules were, in good&#xD;
condition. The young and unschooled in the&#xD;
kind of existence opening before them, feared&#xD;
they should reach the distant theatre of opera-&#xD;
tions without incident 'or excitement, or adven-&#xD;
tures worth relating when they should again&#xD;
reach home ; but the wiser heads shrugged their-&#xD;
shoulders, intimating very plainly that danger&#xD;
might come before they were ready for it.&#xD;
They passed Fort Laramie with nothing to&#xD;
break the monotony of their march. ' Theyjubi-&#xD;
lant spirits of the younger men began to flag ;&#xD;

smoothly things were proceeding, they grew less.&#xD;

wishing - for an opportunity to "show the red-&#xD;
skins what they could do," boasting in no mea-&#xD;
sured terms of their ability to teach them civili-&#xD;
ty. buckeye, who continued 'with the band,&#xD;
heard all this bravado in silence, feeling more&#xD;
inclined to feed their vanity than to rebuke their&#xD;
folly.                                *&#xD;
One morning, one of those who had been&#xD;
loudest in his threats, and had sneered most at&#xD;
the nightly cautions of Brien, was missed from&#xD;
camp.' Believing that he would soon return, no&#xD;
uneasiness- was .felt on his, account ; lut not&#xD;

&#xD;
ii&#xD;
&#xD;
"What do- you' call a natural death ?" asked&#xD;
Buckeye.&#xD;
A young Missourian, by the ,name of Head-&#xD;
ley, replied that he supposed apoplexy might be&#xD;
thus called.&#xD;
"If it's apoplexy,'then apoplexy's a eatchin'&#xD;
disease, and more'n one of yell be down' with it&#xD;
afore you reach the trapping' grounds," said&#xD;
Buckeye, mysteriously.&#xD;
" You are not talking to boys, but 'to men !"&#xD;
retorted therMissoprian, loftily.&#xD;
"1m   lad you've"'told me, for I shouldn't&#xD;
have inistrftsted it," was 'the instant rejoinder.&#xD;
"It's 'plain enough to a  one i hin senses&#xD;
that this rnan'died of a disease of the heart or&#xD;

" Sinee you're so wise, it aint worth while to&#xD;

I've knowed folks to be injured by knowing' too&#xD;
much. An acquaintance of mind was 'bliged to&#xD;
take to his bed jest on account of his general&#xD;
information," answered Buckeye, with quiet&#xD;
sarcasm.&#xD;
A grave was dug beneath a spreading poplar,&#xD;
in which the body was decOntly interred. 'The&#xD;

Brion spoke with some war- a'td bowed&#xD;

strange manner commandpd respect.&#xD;
The stranger's horse at that moment snuffed&#xD;
the air with affright, trembled, reared and made&#xD;
a sidelong bound.&#xD;

" We have just buried a comrade here,; it is&#xD;
the scent of death that terrifies him," said the&#xD;

from the spot.&#xD;
" Did your friend find a natural death, or did&#xD;
he die by Indian hostility?" he inquired.&#xD;
"Indeed, sir, I will request my more expe-&#xD;

much to ye. If it wouldn't be takin' too much&#xD;
liberty, I'd like to ask if your friends are far&#xD;
from here; for I take it you aint alone, seem'&#xD;
you're young and inexperienced, asI.may say ?"&#xD;
"I hope I have friends not far from me ; it&#xD;
would make me wretched to believe to the con-&#xD;
trary," was the evasive reply.&#xD;
Prudential motives hadaclearly dictated Buck-&#xD;
eye's query, and the youth appeared to com-&#xD;
prehend his feelings.&#xD;
"Being a stranger, you don't think it prudent&#xD;
to trust me; is it not so ?"'&#xD;
"Well, I had such a notion, I confess," said.&#xD;
the trapper.&#xD;
"And I am too youthful in appearance to in-&#xD;
vite confidence. Come, be true to yourself !&#xD;
Have I not traced the workings of'your mind?"&#xD;
"If you never commit a greater blunder than&#xD;
that, you'll be a lucky lad," resumed Buckeye,&#xD;
with a characteristic motion of the shoulders.&#xD;
"But young heads," he, added, "may be dis-&#xD;
greet, and a beard isn't allers necessary to make'&#xD;
one shrewd ; though judgin' by appearances, I&#xD;
should naterally conclude you aint a veteran in&#xD;
woodcraft; and your fransis not calculated to&#xD;
&#xD;
endure the hardships and fatigues of this kind of&#xD;
life. It isn't my business, may be, yet I'd ad-&#xD;
vise ye as a friend to keep near your company."&#xD;
"I'm obliged to you for your good will, and&#xD;
will endeavor to take care of myself," was the&#xD;
good-natured reply. " I see you are about to&#xD;
move on. I will bear you company at least for&#xD;
a time, to which proposal ,I trustyou will have&#xD;
no, objections," he added, in the same vein.&#xD;
Briou felt a strong desire to know his new&#xD;
friend's name, purpose, and destination; but&#xD;
notwithstanding his situation was one to make&#xD;
such interrogatories proper,, he did not approach&#xD;
the subject withoutigonsiderable embarrassment&#xD;
that could not have escaped the observing eyes&#xD;
of the stranger.&#xD;
"I presume," he began, "that the party to&#xD;
which you are attached, seek these savage re-&#xD;
gionsfor the sake of excitement and. novelty.&#xD;
alone ?    '&#xD;
" Your judgment is good, my friend."&#xD;
The partisan, though dissatisfied with the re-&#xD;
ply, did not give up the pursuit-&#xD;
"Is your band large, sir ?" he resumed.&#xD;
"Not very; I will remark, too, that their in-&#xD;
terest, I think, will not to any considerable ex-&#xD;
tent conflict with yours. 'Be good enough to&#xD;
drop your suspicions, and permit me to see&#xD;
something of that) generous .confidence that I&#xD;
have heard. distinguishes the roving trapper of&#xD;
the West',, Had I been your enemy, I should&#xD;
4ave permitted that ugly serpent to finish his&#xD;
work. Come, messieurs, tell me what caused&#xD;
the death of yogr ,emradegwhose grave is on&#xD;
the prairie, like a sailor's in the sea ?"&#xD;
These words were spoken with an ingenuous&#xD;
frankness that for the time passing, dispelled&#xD;
distrust from the mind of the mountaineer.&#xD;
Looking at the lad's frank, face, he'could not re-&#xD;
sist the convictionthat his intentions were friend-&#xD;
ly, his mind void ofhypcriy.&#xD;
"Forgive my reserve, good youth," saidthe&#xD;
partisan, with unaffected earnestness, pausing-&#xD;
and extending his hand, " The life that Iam at&#xD;
present follpwing,is one to make me distrustful of&#xD;
my fellows, and seal up, the warm fountains of&#xD;
the heart. Know, young sir, that I am, the&#xD;
leader of'art entefprise that, stirs ug the bitter-&#xD;
est feings of rivalry in pertain quarters-a ri-&#xD;
valryful.of all manner of subtlety and hostility.&#xD;
It has 'not been Iong thus, for you must under?'&#xD;
stand itha haye, until recently, been n t man's&#xD;
servant, nor tied tq other interest than my own.&#xD;
I have been a free trapper, consulting the stars&#xD;
&#xD;
and my own convictions to govern my course ;&#xD;
but since I accepted this leadership, I am anoth-&#xD;
er man. My eyes have to be in all directions.&#xD;
I am, in truth, a sort of a watch-dog to guard&#xD;
the property  of others, and like that noble&#xD;
animal, shall be prized according to my faith-&#xD;
fulness and the acuteness of my instincts. So&#xD;
much for my apparent churlishness and reserve&#xD;
-an explanation I have not before deigned to,&#xD;
make even to the honest man you see at my&#xD;
side."&#xD;
"No more, I beg of you ! I know that you&#xD;
are the soul of generosity and honor ; otherwise,&#xD;
the language of the face is false in its utterance."&#xD;
This -flattering avowal had something more&#xD;
than the mere wording to commend it to the&#xD;
partisan; the tones went directly to that spot&#xD;
where human friendship begins. A sense of&#xD;
satisfaction accompanied the youth's speech into&#xD;
Brion's ears, and the last lingering fragment of&#xD;
contempt said adieu. He straightened his figure&#xD;
in the saddle, and seemed ten years younger with&#xD;
his handsome "face, free from lurking doubt, and&#xD;
his lips smiling through his dark beard. I&#xD;
" You do me too much credit, I assure you,"&#xD;
he answered, in a genial voice, which caused&#xD;
the stripling to regard him with deepening at-&#xD;
tention. "But we will not dwell upon this mat.&#xD;
ter longer. Common courtesy touches my el-&#xD;
bow, reminding me that the civil question pro-&#xD;
posed by you has not been answered. You wish&#xD;
to know the cause of our associate's sudden de-&#xD;
-cease.- Let me inform  you that'I have buried&#xD;
two of our men' within forty-eight hours, who&#xD;
bore on their persons novisible signs of violence.'&#xD;
Various conjecturep are formed in regard to&#xD;
the subject, the prevailing sentiment being, I&#xD;
think, that both died of a disease of the heart or&#xD;
brain. My friend Buckeye will not hesitate,-I&#xD;
expect, to speak his mind fully and freely, and,&#xD;
give us both the benefit of his. sousndjudgment&#xD;
and experience."&#xD;
The trapper mused, then looked inquiringly&#xD;
at the partisan, to see how far his expression;&#xD;
invited or Warranted confidence;, that idividual&#xD;
nodded to the mate interrogatory, but still.Buek.&#xD;
eye remained silent with his eyes' cast downward,&#xD;
to the pommel of his saddle, or fixed uponthe&#xD;
youth at his side, whose large horse bore him&#xD;
like a feather, apparently proud of his ;own,&#xD;
strength.&#xD;
"If I was to speak the truth like an honest&#xD;
man, as is beeomisg to me and all others, I4&#xD;
should, assert confidently that the two men had&#xD;
&#xD;
r7i  / i&#xD;

&#xD;
REDPATH.&#xD;
&#xD;
foul play. 'atwarehow it'll seem to them that&#xD;
don't know what I do, and never heard the&#xD;
name of Redpath."&#xD;
The youth turned an eager, searching look on&#xD;
the trapper.&#xD;
" Stop, my friend," he said, " and allow me&#xD;
to interrupt you by asking, who is Redpath ?"&#xD;
"Ask anything you please, sir-ask what&#xD;
makes the grass grow, or the heart beat, or the&#xD;
sun shine? Such questions might be' common-&#xD;
place enough, and under some circumstances no&#xD;
doubt very proper ; but answering them is anoth-&#xD;
er affair."'&#xD;
"You mean to say that Redpath is a myste-&#xD;
rious personage, whom you know. only by-his&#xD;
deeds, or what is more probable, by hearsay."&#xD;
"Hearsay comes very near 'to' it, but don't&#xD;
quite cover the whole ground. I have seen ef-&#xD;
fects that were attributed to the one I named, by&#xD;
those Who had more knowledge of him than I.&#xD;
Redpath is the enemy of the white man, the sworn&#xD;
foe of the trapper and hunter. Where are his&#xD;
haunts, and what does he look like, will be ask-&#xD;
ed ? He is in the lonely defiles, on the moun-&#xD;
tains, in the forests, upon the wide prairies.&#xD;
He is one as gives no warni' of his approach.&#xD;
He comes and goes with the speed of an eagle&#xD;
on the wing; makes a swoop, strikes the pale-&#xD;
face with the shaft of death, and is away. He&#xD;
can't be trailed, he can't be follered, he can't be&#xD;
brought within the range of the double sights.&#xD;
He fiads a band like the cap'n's; he dogs it, he&#xD;
hangs upon it in the front, in the rear; yet nobody&#xD;
knows where he is, or what brings death upon&#xD;
'em, or what power directs the hidden bolt.&#xD;
Where did I hear all this? you'll next want to&#xD;
know. By the dim watch-fires of the wandering&#xD;
hunter, in the- camp of the trapper, from the&#xD;
mouths of old voyagers, from the lips of fearless&#xD;
adventurers,, daring mountaineers, and in the&#xD;
wigwams offriendly Indians.'"&#xD;
The cheeks of the unknown youth grew pale,&#xD;
and the partisan's brow wore a sombre expres-&#xD;
sion during Buckeye's;singular recital. .He first&#xD;
observed them both attentively, as if' to satisfy&#xD;
himself-of the' sincerity of one, and to learn how&#xD;
much o'thetineredible tale' was credited by the&#xD;
other who had the-prestige of a strong mind&#xD;
above the vagaries of superstition.&#xD;
"What, is,our 'opinion of all this ?"° the&#xD;
stranger asked addressing Brion.&#xD;
The, latter colored' and appeared- disposed to&#xD;
evade thenoe qtestion, afraid either of being&#xD;
accused'of'weaknees, or shrinking, from speaking.&#xD;

&#xD;
his honest convictions. His. eafldon did not&#xD;
pass unnoticed.&#xD;
" I am ready to confess that I have often heard-&#xD;
the nanie of Redpath up in the mountain yonder.&#xD;
The trappers wesgwont to talk of him -inlow&#xD;
tones over their night-fires and buaalohuimps.&#xD;
He is'supposed to be a bold and cunning sav&#xD;
age of great personal strength, who spends his&#xD;
life in avenging some real or fancied wrong.&#xD;
That his doings -are exaggerated, is very probe.&#xD;
able, and yet the being called Redpath'is dan-&#xD;
gerous. You may consider 'him fabulons; you&#xD;
may even smile tt my seriousness, and pity my&#xD;
credulity."&#xD;
"And so) you conclude Redpath slew your&#xD;
men ?"&#xD;
There was, satrifle of irony in the stranger's&#xD;
tones that did not escape Brion's notice.&#xD;
" I have:notyet admitted that, I believe'."&#xD;
"sIt was I who affirmed it," said Buckeye.&#xD;
" One admission which you made you have&#xD;
evidently forgotten; you stated clearly that'&#xD;
there were no marks of violence an the bodies ?"'&#xD;
Buckeye was; embarrassed by the cross ques-&#xD;
tioning of his new acquaintance; to gain time as&#xD;
well as to hide 'his momentary confusion, he&#xD;
helped himself to agenerous quid of tobacco.&#xD;
Like most men, he was afraid of ridicule, and&#xD;
that, in fact, was about-the only thing he feared&#xD;
in the world.&#xD;
" I know it has a curis look at firSt, but a fact'&#xD;
is a fact, and nothin' can change it' You see he&#xD;
has the knack of doi' it in austrainge. way."&#xD;
" I should think so."&#xD;
"I reckon it' wont make no great difference&#xD;
what you think 1" retorted Buckeye, frowning.&#xD;
. "Not the slightest'; but it is a very myste-&#xD;
rions tale you hate been telling, and you must&#xD;
pardon a littlenatural doubt on my part. If'you&#xD;
scowl-thus, I shall leave-you.'"&#xD;
The trapper said" to himself; "It wont-be 'a'&#xD;

" To be killed," suddenly resumed the young&#xD;
man, rallying, " one must inevitably receive in-&#xD;
juries of some kind-either wounds-or bruises-&#xD;
something to leave tangible marks upon the pei-&#xD;
son. Tell me, noW, is there not some reason in&#xD;
'this logic?"&#xD;
0' 0 too much," replied Buckeye, sullenly.&#xD;
Pardon, sir," continued' the other, addressing&#xD;
Brion, "you have interested me very much in&#xD;
this Wonderful relation. Really, do-you believe&#xD;
in this savage vampire-this Gian Ben Gian of&#xD;

"'No, more than what I am constrained to.&#xD;

force of my last remark."&#xD;
"Do you fear this inexplicable enemy of the&#xD;
pale faces "&#xD;
Whatever' fault this question might have, -it&#xD;
did not' lack explicitness. The hot blood flew&#xD;
to Brion's face in an instant, and he-turned a&#xD;
proud, rebuking face upon the questioner.&#xD;
" Your extreme youthfulness," he said, with&#xD;
dignified severity, "induces me to overlook the-.&#xD;
the-impertinence of your question."-&#xD;
"I have offended."&#xD;
"And I have forgiven:"  '&#xD;
" Thanks !"&#xD;
" Speak no more of it. I shall be cautious'&#xD;
but not cowardly. 'Ihate cowardice--it is a spe-&#xD;

ed that another animal shouldhave the audacity&#xD;

&#xD;
to pass him. Buckeye's exhilaration soon ex-&#xD;
pended itself, and he allowed Brion to come up&#xD;
with him.&#xD;
"Your horse has excellent qualities, I'm&#xD;
sure," the young man remarked, as tsqkeyere-&#xD;
sumed his former place.&#xD;
"He hasn't no equal between this and the&#xD;
Pacific, I reckon-no superior,- sartin.!"&#xD;
"Sagacious and intelligent; without doubt.&#xD;
You call him Flash on account, of his speed,&#xD;
perhaps ?"&#xD;
"Jest for that reason, Mister, and no other.&#xD;
He isn't so fat and sleek as some hoss-flesh I've&#xD;
seen, but when there's need,I know pretty near&#xD;
where to find him. Flash has a few tricks too,&#xD;
that I've learned him, :e'enamost human."&#xD;
Brion glanced at 'the stranger youth at that&#xD;
moment, and perceived that he waslooking at&#xD;
the hatchet that he 'had taken from the tree in&#xD;
the manner described, .and which he had .carried&#xD;
ever since at his side or his saddle-bow. Seeing&#xD;
that the partisan had detected the directionof his&#xD;
eyes, he appeared disconcerted, and ,instantly&#xD;
turned his attention another way. The moun-&#xD;
taineer was sagacious and quick to observe, and&#xD;
the circumstance, slight as it was, did not pass&#xD;
unnoted. A .train of novel ideas began there-&#xD;
upon to whirl through his brain; he seemed&#xD;
trying to work out some kind of.a problem with.&#xD;
out being able to find the proper data from which&#xD;
to start. Buckeye contrived to touch him on the&#xD;
arm,giving him a warning look that said, " Cap'n,&#xD;
I'm very suspicious of this little feller"&#xD;
But a change held, eme over the partisan-the&#xD;
signs of the trapper were upheeded; he rode on&#xD;
singularly taciturn and reflective.&#xD;
"Look, comrade, there's a- horseman away&#xD;
yonder, and he's making signals 1" exclaimed&#xD;
Buckeye, pointing toward the muntains.&#xD;
"I thank youfor your company,.brave knights&#xD;
of the rifle and.trap. v4dieu, messieurs, adieu !"&#xD;
With a neigh of joy, Brave recognized the&#xD;
signal to go, and sprang away with a force that&#xD;
made the ground tremble.&#xD;
"A  spy," cried the. trapper, Yehemently.&#xD;
" Say but the word, c ap'n, and I'Al loller and&#xD;
bring the young scamp back"-&#xD;
"Do no such thing,"said lrion, earnedtly.&#xD;
t'And what ,en propose-i s impracticable.. See&#xD;
how pe rides,! Ah, nly friend, you might -as,&#xD;

black horse and hisgider with beth vexatios aid&#xD;
admiration-vexed he hardly knewfgr what; and&#xD;
admiring because of :the. swiftness of the steed.&#xD;
&#xD;
He shook his wise head dubiously, wonderingg&#xD;
how sueh .a silken sort of lad got so ;far from&#xD;

"Well ?"&#xD;

" But qo4ay I _yopt tell you.  Do you know&#xD;

The trapper urged  Ash to a gallop, and&#xD;
bounded along the almost interminable reach of&#xD;

growing less and less to the eyes .that followed&#xD;

Apbrose Sellar and - Pierre Mariot were&#xD;

Pierre entered keenly into the rivalry of the&#xD;
trade, with fewer conscientious scruples than his&#xD;
predecessor. To the senior partner's credit be it&#xD;
written, that he had more of that which men&#xD;
terni principlee' than the junior ; b t' Mr. Bell-&#xD;
mar or Monsieur Bellmar-forhe was a French-&#xD;
man-was avaricious, possessed of a restless,&#xD;
insatiate spirit of gain, which led him on step&#xD;
by step, encouraged by Pierre, to many acts that&#xD;
he feared would -trouble him on his death-bed.&#xD;
The new fur company had injured his business;&#xD;
there had been a perceptible decline in his income&#xD;
since its organization. -Such a state of things&#xD;
alarmed his cupidity, stimulating him to devise&#xD;
means to checkmate his competitors, and-turn&#xD;
the stream of gold once more into his coffers.&#xD;
Strategy he had always encouraged and reward-&#xD;
ed, when successful among his employees ; but&#xD;
since the new association had secured the ser-&#xD;
'vices of Ben Brion as leader of the trapping op-&#xD;
erations, he was aware that ordinary art would&#xD;
fall; , therefore something out' of the common&#xD;
order must be done, or the tradewould' languish,&#xD;
and he perhaps be driven, ultimately, rentirely-&#xD;
from the field that he had occupied so long, and&#xD;
gleaned his wealth from. Pierre Mariot, who&#xD;
had also heard the note of warning which this&#xD;
arrangement had sounded, gave evidence-that he&#xD;
would set himself at work in earnest.&#xD;
Mignon-Bellmar's daughter-was one day in&#xD;
the library, amusing herself, as she was wont,&#xD;
with her good companions, the books.  She&#xD;
heard her father approaching, accompanied by&#xD;
Mariot, whose, voice always admonished her of&#xD;
his proximity.- There was a'small apartment&#xD;
beyond, and into that Mignon went,-closing the&#xD;
door. By the time she was seated, ready to re-&#xD;
sume her reading, "Billtnar and Pierre reached&#xD;
the library.  Mademoiselle   Mignon' observed&#xD;
that something, very unusual took place, viz.,.&#xD;
Mariot shut the door and locked it, after which&#xD;
she heard him draw adlhair'near 'the writing-&#xD;
desk'where her father invariably 'sat. - Mignon&#xD;
did not like her position. "She was forced to be&#xD;
a listener, provided they conversed in their nat-&#xD;
ural- tones, ther1'being no mode;of egress- save&#xD;
through the apartuient taken possession' of.&#xD;
" You are a*are,b-Monsieur Bellmar, that this&#xD;
confounded *ifsr company that haS 'given" us so&#xD;
much uneasiness; has engaged Ben Brion for&#xD;
its leader1 ? Brion, you will remember,' is: the&#xD;
man whose services we tried to secure ?"'&#xD;
" Yes, the disagreeable news has reached me.&#xD;
I perceive that our business will sustain a se=&#xD;
verer check than ever, Monsieur Mariot."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Can you doubt it? Something must be&#xD;
done," said Pierre.&#xD;
"Mg foi!1 we have not ceased to do something&#xD;
ever since these unlucky rival companies existed.&#xD;
What new expedient remains?"'&#xD;
"That is a point to be settled by us, and with-&#xD;
out delay."'.&#xD;
"Ah, my friend, common strategy will not do&#xD;
with Ben Brion."&#xD;
"Who knows that better than I ? ' It is for&#xD;
that very reason that we must take measures&#xD;
bold and energetic."&#xD;
M. Bellmar mused.&#xD;
" We are quite alone, I suppose ?" Mariot&#xD;
added.&#xD;
Mignon,'who sat directly opposite the keyhole&#xD;
of the door, was now listening with eager inter-&#xD;
est, and without' a single feeling of compunction.-&#xD;
"Entirely alone," replied Bellmar.&#xD;
"We must ruin the American Fur Compa-&#xD;
ny !" with emphasis on the word "ruin."&#xD;
" Be good enough to tell me howl? my strate-&#xD;
gical resources are exhausted."&#xD;
"We  must break up and disorganize the party&#xD;
under Brion."&#xD;
" You are just as far from the question, Mon-&#xD;
sieur Mariot.' You do not inform me how this&#xD;
is to be accomplished."&#xD;
"By means that may perchance startle you.",&#xD;
Mignon shuddered, knowing that something&#xD;
terrible was in Mariot's mind ; she knew by the&#xD;
tones of his voice.&#xD;
"We must keep the penalties of the law in&#xD;
view,' quoth Bellmar, wriggling in his chair.&#xD;
"Law   does not' reach 'beyond Fort Leaven-&#xD;
worth. We will employ ilustruments that laugh&#xD;

"Indians i"&#xD;
Mignon made a slight movement.&#xD;
"What' was'that ?" asked Pierre.&#xD;
" Nothing ; go on; you would, you say, em-&#xD;
ploy savages-at least, you mean so to be un-&#xD;
derstood?"&#xD;
"Yes; our enemies-they who take from me&#xD;
my business, are my' enemies-must be awed,&#xD;
shocked, stunned, scattered, the survivors driven&#xD;
from the trapping groundslike trembling sheep.'&#xD;
Mariot pronounced these words with startling&#xD;
energy, stamping angrily upon the floor.&#xD;
"There is much evil in-that man;" thought&#xD;
Mignon;'&#xD;
"Proceed," said the senior.&#xD;
" I have'told yott all."&#xD;
"Foudre I" exclaimed Bellmar, impatiently.&#xD;
" You have told me nothing 1"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Leave the ways and means to me, and you&#xD;
will have naught to regret."&#xD;
Monsieur Bellnar rose and paced the floor.&#xD;
"I shrink from acts"of hostility," he added."&#xD;
"I shrink from losing my invested' capital l"&#xD;
retorted Mariot, 'in a hard, dry tone'in which self&#xD;
was uppermost.&#xD;
"Such things lay heavy on 'one's conscience&#xD;
as one grows old, Pierre," retorted Bellmar, in&#xD;
deprecating way:&#xD;
" It would grieve me to be obliged to with-&#xD;
draw my capital, and dissolve the old and re-&#xD;
spectable house of Bellitar &amp;amp;'Mariot."&#xD;
" It would be a sad blow to a man'of my years,&#xD;
wanting as I do, your youthfulness and energy."&#xD;
" Will you abandon this to me ?"&#xD;
"Nous verrons f"&#xD;
" Delay will baffie my purpose ; accede at&#xD;
once."&#xD;
" You will send agents ?"&#xD;
" Doubtless."&#xD;
"Perhaps go yourself?"&#xD;
"It is possible."&#xD;
"And it will cost ?"&#xD;
"A thousand dollars."&#xD;
"So much '?"&#xD;
" The benefits will be tenfold. 'That company&#xD;
annihilated, we go on again as in old times, when&#xD;
my father lived."&#xD;
" What do yous propose in relation to Brion ?"&#xD;
"Pardon, monsieur, but I will not worry you&#xD;
with details. You consent "              .&#xD;
" You will be ,careful of'human life ? Blood&#xD;
on your conscience will prove a 'burden."&#xD;
"Do not be uneasy. I will'play my hand&#xD;
skilfully; but remember that I do iot promise&#xD;
to do mischief!"&#xD;
" Well, Mariot, -be discreet and spend money&#xD;
to advantage. By the way, I have received a&#xD;
letter from our Indian agent, Fournier, which I&#xD;
will show you. It is in my pocket--no, it is in,&#xD;
a coat that I took off yesterday. I will gofor it."&#xD;
"4Bellmar is getting into his dotage; he is&#xD;
too weak, too weak I''-muttered Mariot, the mo-&#xD;
ment the senior left the room. " He'wishes for&#xD;
a plan of the campaign, but fain not sb stupid&#xD;
as to show my order'of Battle; it would strike&#xD;
him dumb, hidiserves are so shattered."&#xD;
"Ah," said Mignon, to herself," " you do not&#xD;
know who heardPthat-rem*;rL"&#xD;
" Once in receipt of nifyplah, he would soon&#xD;
betray all to Migndoi. Mignon is timid, and her&#xD;
conscience is as sensitive o evil as 'mercury to&#xD;
the changes'oftepetattiie '&#xD;
&#xD;
"Astute Pierre Mariot!" thought Mademoi-&#xD;
selle Belmar.&#xD;
The senior returned with the letter, which&#xD;
treated in the main, of affairs of no interest to&#xD;
the reader ; in it, however, occurred this curious&#xD;
passage. *The trappers and hunters, who are&#xD;
daily arriving at the'trading-house, have much&#xD;
to say about that mysterious personage whom I&#xD;
referred to in a former letter. He' is supposed,&#xD;
by many, to be a celebrated Blackfoot chief&#xD;
that bears mortal enmity to all whose faces are&#xD;
white. Would it not be lucky if he should&#xD;
cross the trail of the new company, and give&#xD;
them a taste of his quality ? I am endeavoring&#xD;
to cultivate friendly relations with the Blaek-&#xD;
feet, with a fair prospect of success. I think it&#xD;
would be well to send out a fresh stock of In-&#xD;
dian finery by your next brigade, such as glass&#xD;
beads, ribbons, pipes. Also a lot of hunting-&#xD;
knives and cheap guns. But do not be too san-&#xD;
guine about the Blackfeet; they are a wily,&#xD;
cruel, intractable race in every particular, differ-&#xD;
ing from their neighbors, the Nez Perces, who&#xD;
are a harmless, honest people, on ghom we can&#xD;
rely in all pertaining to legitimate trade, but who&#xD;
cannot easily be, induced to act against other&#xD;
companies - in turning' the tide of traffic to our&#xD;
interest."&#xD;
" Do you know much of this redoubtable na-&#xD;
tive to which Fournier alludes ?" Mariot inquir-&#xD;
ed, with an earnestness that he regretted a mo-&#xD;
ment after.&#xD;
"'By common camp gossip, only ;"a species&#xD;
of information not very reliable, friend Pierre,"&#xD;
was theresponse.&#xD;
"Is henot a being purely of the imagination,&#xD;
think you-a sort of bugbear created by some va-&#xD;
grant adventurer, to put tongues in motion that&#xD;
had been too long silent'to be particular I"&#xD;
' It may be thus, but it is scarcely probable.&#xD;
Mountaineers are shrewd, and the American&#xD;
free trapper has sense, and 'always understands&#xD;
what he's about."&#xD;
"Do the Americans alsO' talk of Redpath ?"&#xD;
"Yes, mon ami.' I aon'ersed with one -Buck-&#xD;
eye, a genuine type of the free trapper class, that&#xD;
has a frm belief in such a personage."&#xD;
" Well,"there is nothing marvellous in the&#xD;
fact that an' Indian chief should be revengeful,&#xD;
spurred on as he may be by a burning sense of&#xD;
wrong.         wih           l&#xD;
it is not that whieh excites alarm;it is the&#xD;
matini 'of his vengeance, theterrible mystery&#xD;
that hangs over his movement, his wondrous&#xD;

And then the seniorgdded:&#xD;
"Our rivals ire making r pg efforts to fill&#xD;

" Go Qn, sr."&#xD;
"As-as shall greatly surprise them," he rp-'&#xD;
pumed, in a voice much modified, and with A&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"This is a quiet place to make confidential ar-&#xD;
rangements," he continued, looking about him&#xD;
with a satisfied air. " I may wish to be closeted&#xD;

The parties arose and left the library, while&#xD;
Mignon remained in her chair, like one very&#xD;
much startled and confounded. She bad satis-&#xD;
lied herself long before that Pierre lariot was a&#xD;
man of a low standard of morality, but she was&#xD;
not prepared to believe him so much , villain&#xD;
as he had proved himsplf. He was meditating&#xD;
crime--schening the ruin of others-planning&#xD;
deeds of blood--drawing her father into the vor--&#xD;
tex of his evil mind.   Ah, Mariot, your last vir-&#xD;
tue and your last chance faded from the heprt of&#xD;
Mignon that morning. She scorned, she despis-&#xD;
ed you, when you left the house, full of dark de-&#xD;
vices for the overthrow of your brother man !&#xD;
)Iignon went to the window, the, only one.in&#xD;
the room, and which fronted the street, The&#xD;
sash was, raised a little. Mariot and her father&#xD;
had reached the ;khallogor, and the former was&#xD;
upon the steps when she heard him remark :&#xD;
" Here comes Brion 1"&#xD;
Mademoiselle  ellngr gt; er eyes 4own the&#xD;

" How noble !" exclaimed Mignon, enthusi-&#xD;
astically, then flushing et her war phesbp drew&#xD;

"A fine picture. 0, Pierre. Iarint, if you coul4&#xD;

"He reminds one of the gallant cavaliers of&#xD;
the old school," she heard her father say. Brion&#xD;
was now oppositethe .house; he raised his eyes&#xD;
to the window.and spy lIigron., She was charm-&#xD;
ing, and the gaze he thusunwillingly surprised,&#xD;
thrilled hin, and made himblbush ike.,a school-&#xD;

with Nature in her simplest and yet grandest&#xD;
form of development had not huntedd Brion's&#xD;
susceptibility to those delightful emotions which&#xD;
the presence of a lovely womaninspires. For a&#xD;
second, an appreciative space of time to the-soul&#xD;
-the mountaineer was dazzled and at a loss ;&#xD;
then he recovered his self-possession, and bowed&#xD;
like a knight templar.&#xD;
Mignon ran from   the window, in a strange&#xD;
flutter of excitement, and the sound.of clatter-&#xD;
ing hoofs follpwed-her to her chamber.,&#xD;
0 Mignon ! lost and won, in  single day!&#xD;
Three individuals answering, to ,the appella-&#xD;
tives of Grenier, Kinesid and  ardette; were&#xD;
segfed upon a bench not far fro  the establish-&#xD;
ment.of Belmar $ Mariot. The first was a, Ger-&#xD;
man, the, second a Frenchman, the third, a half-&#xD;
breed. Grenier -was despairing, Kincaid.angry,&#xD;
Gardette saulen, and all were hungry. They&#xD;
belonged to the lazier, less efficient and most un-&#xD;
scrupulous of the mountsinegrs. Their pypsent&#xD;
possessions were:meagre,:-having nothing, about&#xD;
them but bad reputations, which they had richly&#xD;
earned, and were in a fair way to keep. They&#xD;
ha4 offered their services to varigns furcompas-&#xD;

&#xD;
warned to leave the place within four-and-twen-&#xD;
ty hours, under the dire penalty of a coat of tar&#xD;
and feathers-a garment dreaded alike by every&#xD;
class of the genus homo.- The=short period -of&#xD;
grace allowed them would expire in the morning;&#xD;
but there were serious obstacles in the way of-&#xD;
their departure. Let it be understood that they&#xD;
had no horses, no- arms, nor anything like a&#xD;
proper outfit for the mountains.  They could&#xD;
have dispensed with the first, had they been pro-&#xD;
videdwith the second;, but guns and ammunition&#xD;
were essential necessities, without which they&#xD;
would starve upon the trail. They realized the&#xD;
dilemma into which they had. fallen, and were&#xD;
combining their remaining wits to surmount the&#xD;
difficulties that beset them. Various projects had&#xD;
been discussed, but all in turn rejected, either as&#xD;
impracticable, or unadapted to the emergency;&#xD;
hence their gloomy visages.&#xD;
" Monsieur Mariot cmes this way," said Kin-&#xD;
caid, whose anger-inflamed eyes chanced to be&#xD;
turned to the storehouse of Bellmar &amp;amp; Mariot.&#xD;
" Let him come," retorted Grenier, in a mel-&#xD;
ancholy tone.&#xD;
" Let us hold a knife to his throat till he hire&#xD;
us," proposed the former.'&#xD;
"That's a fool's adviceI" affirmed:Grenier.&#xD;
"You're alwayasgrumbling !" quoth Kincaid.,&#xD;
"Let us go to the Indians !" said Gardette.&#xD;
"And have our scalps taken off," added Kin-&#xD;
caid, spitefully.&#xD;
" Be still. Mariot has something to say to us.,&#xD;
I know by the way he looks and walks," said&#xD;
Grenier.    ,&#xD;
Pierre Mariot approached the trio with a mien&#xD;
so guarded that it was impossible for the parties,&#xD;
to divine whether his coming boded'good or evil.&#xD;
4' Well, messieurs, when do you start for the&#xD;
mountains ?" he asked.&#xD;
Grenierheld his tongue; the-half-breed turn-&#xD;
ed his back to the questioner, and Kincaid said,&#xD;
in a defiant voice:  '&#xD;
"-When we get ready, moneleur !"&#xD;
"Ah, I seef you're waiting for an outfit," re-&#xD;
turned Mariot, in a tone- that at once reraide&amp;amp;&#xD;
Kincaid of the tar and feathers in reserve; he&#xD;
clenched his fist, and' scowled ominously.&#xD;
" You'd do-well to keep your Jests at home I"&#xD;
he gruffly retorted.&#xD;
"Youateinexeerablete1tes, ny good fellow.&#xD;
What will you:wagerthat I shall not -make you&#xD;

"You'd better go about your, business" said&#xD;
Kincaidperversely.&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
"Be reasonable, and don't destroy the only&#xD;
chance left you; it lays between starvaton and&#xD;
feathers, as it is now; but I can set you right&#xD;
again, if I will."&#xD;
" We tried you, and you -refused us-hiring&#xD;
green hands in preference ; that is"why I advise&#xD;
you to leave us."&#xD;
"But if I have changed my mind ?"&#xD;
" Why then, speak out, and we'll hear you."&#xD;
"You are acquainted with the country ?"&#xD;
"I know every yard- of it from here to Co-&#xD;
lumbia River.' I have starved in the Wind&#xD;
Riverrange, feasted at the Yellow Stone; frozen&#xD;
on the Salmon Mountain, and thawed at Walla-&#xD;
Walla. So have' my comrades," asserted the&#xD;
Frenchman, confidently.'&#xD;
"Are you on friendly footing with many of the&#xD;
Indian tribes ?"&#xD;
"With nearly all of them."&#xD;
"And can speak their language, I suppose?"&#xD;
"As well as my mother tongue."&#xD;
"I want men who combine shrewdness, ener-&#xD;
gy and courage, with other qualities."&#xD;
"We have all the qualities you want, mon-&#xD;
sieur," said 'Kincaid, modestly.&#xD;
"I wish you to act as my agents. I shallpay&#xD;
you liberally, providing you enter into my ser-&#xD;
vice with zeal."&#xD;
"Agents, Monsieur   Marlot!"  exclaimed&#xD;
Grenier.  -&#xD;
"Agents in reality, if not openly. You know&#xD;
there are rival ban4s inthe field ?"&#xD;
":I get a little light, monsieur,"&#xD;
"I shall supply ; you with horses and allthat&#xD;
you need, This is no place to give you instruc-&#xD;
tions, neither is our office; therefore you will&#xD;
meet me at Bellmar's, where, we can talk confi-&#xD;
dently, for you must know this is a matter of&#xD;
great importece and secrecy."&#xD;
"We'll be.there, but our engagementic wont&#xD;
'admit of-much delay; monsieur," said Kincaid,&#xD;
with a knowing leer.&#xD;
" I am aware of it,' )Mariot answered, with a&#xD;
smile "An&amp;amp; now promise me that if l pay you&#xD;
a few dollars in advance, you willnot go and get&#xD;

CHAPTER IV:.&#xD;
MARIO' MEETe WITH PIPA   OINTMnNT.&#xD;
In was nearly' dark. Mignon awas returning&#xD;
home from a long walk. She had chosen an&#xD;
unfaeq tented path that she mightreflect without&#xD;
interruption, having much to think of'seriously.&#xD;
Sha found herself placed in an awkward posi-&#xD;
tion in:regard to Pierre Mariott and it was of&#xD;
'that she was meditating. Voices and boisterous&#xD;
laughter reached her ears, assuring her that per-&#xD;
sons were near ; indeed, two men were already&#xD;
in sight, and presently a third ,joined them.&#xD;
Mignon would gladly have evaded them had it&#xD;
been possible; but that-was outtof the question,&#xD;
therebeing no other road andtheyclose at hand-&#xD;
She went forward unhesitatingly with what res-&#xD;
olutibnashe could command, noteven raising her&#xD;
eyes to the faces of the illmannered trio, one of&#xD;
whom placed himself so- as to abstract the-way.&#xD;
Rude jests assailed Mignon ; she was alarmed,&#xD;
"If {the, people -.f'the town threaten usy'to&#xD;
repay them we will insaltstkeir-daughters," said&#xD;
one, staggering toward Mademoiselle Bellinar.&#xD;
" is nO more than just," cried second.&#xD;
"Iuthe she it' pale-she will tint"" added&#xD;
the third sneeringly.&#xD;
M4hew defieto you are, miss. And what&#xD;
pretty goods you wear! Dear -re, not =so fast&#xD;
now' ;you will d'rivse ue of yourempany tioo&#xD;

slow, thick utterance ofa -drunke an.&#xD;

lows like us. But it sl 'auas  a are who'&#xD;
make your 'townsmen ian drue=yet for it&#xD;
only threats and bad words:'&#xD;
&#xD;
y    Mignon recoiled with a cry of terror, for one&#xD;
a of the villains had the insolence. to grasp her&#xD;
arm, employing 'language -that made her cheeks&#xD;
e redden with shome and indignation. She had&#xD;
e the presence of mind to cry for assistance';- and&#xD;
it came promptly and resolutely. A mani-hose&#xD;
eyes seemed to emit lightning, scattered the in-&#xD;
sulters and supported Mignon.  His presence&#xD;
was a Gibraltar of strength to Mignon-there&#xD;
Was such noble determination in his face, such&#xD;
I manliness in. his shapely figure. She recognized&#xD;
the horseman who had ridden so gallantly,-Ben&#xD;
Brion, the mountaineer,' whose name had been&#xD;
mentioned by Mariot.&#xD;
Mademoiselle was'so pretty, so engaging in&#xD;
her deportment, so graceful and warm in the&#xD;
expression of her gratitude, that the partisan&#xD;
sighed when he left her, regretting that his.-call-&#xD;
ing would so soon take him, from Westport,&#xD;
from the vicinage of the only woman who had&#xD;
ever quickened the pulsations of his honest&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
Pierre Mariot had a long conversation with&#xD;
Grenier, Kincaid and Gardette, at the time ap-&#xD;
pointed. Miss Bellmar was as punctual as he,&#xD;
believing it not an act of meanness to hear the&#xD;
development of a'efarious scheme for the injury&#xD;
of those pursuing a lawful- aid honorable busi-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
It would not be edifying to the reader to state&#xD;
all that was said in detail; a few of the most&#xD;
important points will be touched upon.&#xD;
"I think you told me, messieurs mountain'&#xD;
eers," said. Pierre, graciously, "that your en-&#xD;
gagensent woul4 fcnpel you to leave Westport&#xD;
at an early hoursO-das'"&#xD;
".Wei have but ,a  hour's grace, monsieur,-&#xD;
-and then the canaille of this accursed place will&#xD;
be upon' us," replied Kincaid, who acted as&#xD;
spokesman forl histomudes.&#xD;
"Not the canaille alone, worthy hunter, for&#xD;
the more respectable townsmen are much exas-&#xD;
{erated4atyo0e free ac&amp;amp; easy manners. I fear&#xD;
yo; hae acted scaalously, but that is no&#xD;
business-of -mins; it deranges my plans a little,&#xD;
but I can get. along.Now. wewill to the mat-&#xD;

Marlot assumed;.4diffetet-tone and bearing;&#xD;
hp, spoke- firmly, determinedly and rapidly,&#xD;
keeping his keeillypenetrating eyesaied steadi.&#xD;
ly upon his listeners.&#xD;
" I want men that can act disereely-not those&#xD;
&#xD;
who eal only get drunk and act the blaggart&#xD;
and bailer. If r employ you and pay you,&#xD;
you must do my bidding to the letter, add with-'&#xD;
out useless questioning. I know that you are&#xD;
not scrupulous. Keep silent; if you were honest&#xD;
men, you would not do for r"e ; aid if you flat-&#xD;

you will have no trouble in effecting-this. Are&#xD;
you understanding me, mhessieurs ?"&#xD;
- The parties signified that they were.&#xD;
"In your rovings over the mountains, you&#xD;
have doubtless heard the name of Redpath.&#xD;
Come, tell me the truth-is there or is there&#xD;
not such a being?"&#xD;
The sun-browned face of . Eincaid grew a&#xD;
shade whiter; he took his own time to reply,&#xD;
speaking slowly, and with less assurance.&#xD;
Redpath is as real as you or I, or Gardette,&#xD;
or Grenier, or anybody thatlives."&#xD;

ward, pale but calm. Iis features were soften-&#xD;
e4 'by smiles of affected, gaiety-he studied to&#xD;
assumehis most agreeablyphases and phrases.&#xD;
His playfulness might havebeen amusing had&#xD;
it been sincere. Mignon permitted him to ex-&#xD;
haust his. pleasantries with an appearance of&#xD;
complaisance quite at variance with her feelings,&#xD;
well knowing there was something mo re serious&#xD;
behindUall Monsieur Mariot's good humor. He&#xD;
grew sentimental and graciously grave-indica-&#xD;
tions that he was wearing the point.&#xD;
" In view of our approaching marriage "-he&#xD;
began.&#xD;
"What did you say, sir ?"  asked Mignon.&#xD;
"I was going to observe, that in view of our&#xD;
approaching marriage-"&#xD;
"Marriage,. Monsieur Mariot?, Did you not&#xD;
say marriage ?"&#xD;
" That air was charmingly put on, Mignon !&#xD;
Yes I-said the word you have repeated with so&#xD;
much emphasis."&#xD;
"Pleasesallow me to inquire to what parties&#xD;
the word ' our' is intended to apply ?"   .&#xD;
" To ypur charming self and your humble&#xD;
servant, Pierre Mariot," he returned, bowing.&#xD;
" That is news indeed ! How  facetious you&#xD;
are to-day. I have not seen you so amusing for&#xD;
a lon time."&#xD;
"It is you who are facetious, it seems to me,&#xD;
Mademoiselle Bellmar. Your father and I con-&#xD;
versed seriously on this subject last night ; he&#xD;
agrees with me that farther procrastination is&#xD;
unnecessary. You are aware that it was the&#xD;
intention of our parents that we should be united&#xD;
when of a proper , age. Such a compact was&#xD;
V made when we were but children, I think my&#xD;
attentions to you have, been of a character not to&#xD;
be misunderstood., I believed that my advances&#xD;
were reeivd as they were intended; that your&#xD;
own-sympathies as well as the wishes of your,&#xD;
father .were in my favor, leading you naturally&#xD;
to eapeet that the day of gur union must be,&#xD;
near at hand ; it has even been referred to by&#xD;
me ,iner Jearing, as an event long calculated&#xD;
upon."&#xD;
" Monsieurfariot, Iknow. nothing of a mar-&#xD;
rigge  take placebetween you and I," sail&#xD;
Mignon, calmly.&#xD;
e"  ganuyoujest witl such a serious air that&#xD;
you a3 r  ume!"  exclaimedPierre, turning very&#xD;
" Be-assured there will be no marriage be-&#xD;
tween us,"sheT added, in the same tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You positively alarm me. Your manner is&#xD;
really chilling. Do youmean to be understood&#xD;
that all is at an end between is ?".&#xD;
" I simply mean to say tiat I shall never-&#xD;
marry you, Monsieur Mariot."&#xD;
" Mademoiselle Bellmar !"&#xD;
"Am I sufileiently plain' in .my speech to be&#xD;
apprehended ?"&#xD;
"You are cruelly plain if you are in earnest,"&#xD;
he replied.&#xD;
" I never was and never expect to be more in&#xD;
earnest than at this moment. You are to re-&#xD;
ceive this decision as final."&#xD;
"0, I cannot believe this-it is too unexpect-&#xD;
ed," cried Mariot, in a hoarse voice.&#xD;
"Your vanity led you to expect nothing but&#xD;
success. You were always vain, Pierre Mariot.&#xD;
But thank heaven, I have never offered incense&#xD;
to your vanity."&#xD;
Mariot's pale cheeks flushed when Mignon&#xD;
spoke of his vanity; the shaft went home.&#xD;
"I must go to your father. I must know the&#xD;
meaning of this,. I will beg of him to bring you&#xD;
to reason."&#xD;
"Is it my father that you wish to marry,&#xD;
monsieur, or his daughter ?"&#xD;
"Mignon] you are killing me !"&#xD;
"The gifted and the good die young."&#xD;
" What bitterness, Mademoiselle Bellmar.&#xD;
Will you not regret;this ?  I may lose patience,&#xD;
and remorse may visit you when it is too late."&#xD;
"Your vanity spoke then; but do not trou-"&#xD;
ble yourself, I lieg of you.&#xD;
"When I repent mny present decision, I shall&#xD;
better apprehend your menace. You wish to&#xD;
insinuate that I shall sustain a great loss.&#xD;
Believe me, now, I ai perfectly resigned to it,"&#xD;
she rejoined.&#xD;
" What will your worthy father say when he&#xD;
knows your deteininatioft i Mignon, spare him&#xD;
such grief, this union has been the dieam o fhis&#xD;
life !"&#xD;
"Are you thenanch adesirable son-in-law ?"&#xD;
Mariostfelt himself demolished and prostrated.&#xD;
His pride was in-rains; but his anger-strsamed&#xD;

and at4 loss. ,-He knew not whether to retreat&#xD;
or go forward, his fair: enemy had taken him so&#xD;

" Go, Monsieur Mariotjand forgetme. There&#xD;
is, no possibility4hat my feelings will change. SI&#xD;
refuse you for the best reason-in the, world. .I&#xD;
do not like eyout: Would you .wed a woman&#xD;
who makes this confession 2"&#xD;
&#xD;
- "'ou are jealous, perhaps ?" said Mariot,&#xD;
faintly.&#xD;
" There is your unpardonable vanity again.&#xD;
Lovers only are jealous, and I cannot in the na-&#xD;
ture-of things be jealous of a man whose pres-&#xD;
ence is irksome. It is time this interview ended.&#xD;
I wish you happiness with one more like you in&#xD;
heart. Adieu, sir."&#xD;
Mademoiselle Mignon arose, bowed ceremo-&#xD;
niously, that is coldly, and left Mariot alone,&#xD;
who, a moment.later, was heard hurrying through&#xD;
the hall to the street.&#xD;
A month after the events just recorded, at the&#xD;
close of a day which had been uncommonly fine,&#xD;
a man on horseback approached a succession of&#xD;
rugged hills and defiles in the vicinage of those&#xD;
extensive prairies lying along the Nebraska Riv-&#xD;
er for many miles, the favorite' hunting grounds&#xD;
of the dreaded Blackfeet. It would have puz-&#xD;
zled a hunter, even, to- have determined wheth-&#xD;
er the horseman was a white man or an Indian.&#xD;
Indeed he could not well merit the term white,&#xD;
his rough features being much burned by the ve-&#xD;
hement suns of the prairies. There was nothing&#xD;
very notable about his appearance. His horse&#xD;
was a strong, tough nag, chosen more for his&#xD;
powers of endurance than for speed or beauty ;&#xD;
while the rider and his belongings filled up the&#xD;
picture of a free trapper, very well provided for&#xD;
the practice of his vocation.&#xD;
He proceeded moderately and with much cir-&#xD;
cumspection, as if conscious that he was in a&#xD;
situation requiring constant vigilance. Soon he&#xD;
entered a valley almost destitute of vegetation,&#xD;
and at that hour gloomy as it was sterile. The&#xD;
trapper dismounted, after going the distance of&#xD;
an hundred rods or more, then turned to the&#xD;
right into a gully worn by a stream of water&#xD;
during the wet seasons, leading his .horse by the&#xD;
bridle. 'The way must have been well known to&#xD;
him, for he went forward with a confident step,&#xD;
though retaining his watchful deportment;like&#xD;
one resolutely determined not to be surprised&#xD;
by an enemy. For the next half hour he con-&#xD;
tinued to advance, frequently pausing a moment&#xD;
to listen. He stopped in a small basin or hol-&#xD;
low, shut in by trees and .rocks-a spot that&#xD;
might be easily overlooked by a thousand, men&#xD;
searching for a hiding place. Near the middle&#xD;
of the  dingle, half-buried in wild shrubbery, there-&#xD;
was a hut made of sticks, andcovered with bark,'&#xD;
and which =might have escaped a less vigilant&#xD;
eye ;, toward that humble habitation the trapper&#xD;
directed his steps. He pushed open the door,&#xD;
&#xD;
and a start of surprise indicated that he had&#xD;
made a discovery unexpected and not wholly&#xD;
agreeable. A dusky figure reposing by' a fire&#xD;
that faintly glowed on the ground, sprang to his&#xD;
feet and drew his hunting-knife the instant the&#xD;
intruder looked in ; but seeing who had disturb-&#xD;
ed him, returned the weapon to its sheath, keep-&#xD;
ing his hand on the .handle, however, as if not&#xD;
altogether decided whether to assume a hostile&#xD;
attitude or not.&#xD;
"Ravenclaw !" exclaimed the trapper.&#xD;
"fBeavertaker P" said the other, in the guttural&#xD;
tones of the red 'man.&#xD;
'"Why do you come tothe hunting grounds&#xD;
of the Blackfoot ?" he asked, with a scowl of&#xD;
suspicion.&#xD;
"I come because my wife is a Blackfoot, and&#xD;
my home is with her people. Does it seem&#xD;
strange to my brother that the heart of Beaver-&#xD;
taker is heavy when he dwells in the wigwams&#xD;
of the pale faces?"&#xD;
".What is this you say ?  Are not your veins&#xD;
poisoned with the blood of the white man? Can&#xD;
you belong to the warlike Blackfoot, till you&#xD;
have bled away the venom of the pale-faces ?&#xD;
No, you will be but a woman among warriors, a&#xD;
child among men,", replied IRavenclaw,. dis-&#xD;
dainfully.&#xD;
"Your thoughts are sour, and your wgrds&#xD;
are bitter. Hear me, Ravenclaw. I have been&#xD;
among the white men and I found their hearts&#xD;
full of hatred; they drove me forth as if I had&#xD;
.been a worthless dog, fit only to hunger and die&#xD;
on the prairie. I shook my hatchet 'at them,&#xD;
and came away with my heart burning for ven-&#xD;
geance. I shouted the war-whoop of the brave&#xD;
Blackfoot nation, and turned my back on them.&#xD;
I said, I will go back to my adopted people,&#xD;
and tell them my wrongs, and ask them to lie in&#xD;
wait with 'me to take the scalps of my ene-&#xD;
mies. That is what I swore to do, and behold&#xD;
I am here."&#xD;
Ravenclaw gave a slight exclamation of ap-&#xD;
probation.&#xD;
" I came here to get news of my wife, and to&#xD;
unite myself to her people forever. But the&#xD;
heart of 1,avenclaw gives me no welcome, and&#xD;
he tells te nothing of my wife. I have no&#xD;
friends, no home, no nation.  I will go and&#xD;
dwell in solitude with the wild beasts."&#xD;
" Some men have two faces and two tongues,"&#xD;
said Ravenclaw. " They show one face to the&#xD;
white man, and another to the red; they talk&#xD;
&#xD;
* 4&#xD;

gther to the Indian."&#xD;
"Iunderstand; you think I come to you with&#xD;
lie in my pouth, with a hollow heart and&#xD;
emptybauds.  iut you shall sep."&#xD;
evayertaker called to his or e  th  beast&#xD;
c pe eo his side; he relayed hidp.gf his burden&#xD;
a4d turned hipi ,1op9  A package wylchhad&#xD;
h9n fsteed to the cpper, he carried into the&#xD;
hut and opened; it contained various articles&#xD;
valued by Indians, beads, ribbons, high-colored&#xD;
stuffs, smull mirrors, knives, etc. y&#xD;
An expression of contempt grew upon the&#xD;
Blackfoot's face.&#xD;
"These things Ihave brought from the distant&#xD;
wigwams of the pale-faces; let my brother take&#xD;
what ha liks, and the heart of Beavertaker will&#xD;
row light again," said the half-breed.&#xD;
Ryenclaw did op deig tp loo at the goods,&#xD;
his .wb    pontracted threateningly.&#xD;
"What am I," he cried, in  startling voice,&#xD;
that these pitifpl trifles should be offered me?&#xD;
4i I a vain aquaw, tq covet such petty gew-&#xD;
gaws . You are not wise, Beavertaker, you are&#xD;
not wise; yon do not yet know the soul of Ra-&#xD;
venclaw. He wants no such foolery-he wants&#xD;
140t his arms end his horse; more would be a&#xD;
burden to hinder his movements. You might&#xD;
dazzle the eyes of silly women with your gay&#xD;
wares, but the eyes of a true warrior can look at&#xD;
the sun without being dazzled. For this insult&#xD;
you deserve to die !"&#xD;
"'You are in bad temper, my brother. I will&#xD;
pgi p xmy goods and go in search of my wife,&#xD;
ind see if she is also my enemy."&#xD;
"Listen; when the white.man wishes to de-&#xD;
ceiyp the Indian, he commences giving him&#xD;
.      presents, and he ends by cutting his throat. Wa-&#xD;
wr! it is these presents of worthless stuff that&#xD;
re destroying the red races.  Foos are they&#xD;
11 who accept presents .from the hands of the&#xD;
artful pale-face. Take them from my sight, lest&#xD;
I go mad and kill you ."&#xD;
Beaver bound his goods and placed the pack-&#xD;
age out of sight.&#xD;
"Yqu doubt me; but hear what I will tell&#xD;
yqu, pad doubt no longer. A large party of the&#xD;
race yop hate are at hand; they are going to'&#xD;
the mountains to trap, and they have brought&#xD;
many packs of goods .to buy peltries with. I&#xD;
will hea4 a party of Blachfoot warriors to sur-&#xD;
p-ise them."j&#xD;
"That is better ; but Ravenclaw always finds&#xD;
&#xD;
REDPATH.&#xD;
&#xD;
an enemy without a guide," returned the iddian,&#xD;
proudly.,&#xD;
" Do you Jovger dgybt me ?" asked thy half-&#xD;
breed, calmly.,&#xD;
"I believe you would destroy when it is your&#xD;
interest to destroy."&#xD;
"And I have another plan'to revenge myself&#xD;
on these people, who are robbing our hunting&#xD;
and trapping grounds of game," said Beaver-&#xD;
taker, in a suppressed voice.&#xD;
It "peak."&#xD;
" I will seek for him at the mention of whose&#xD;
name the white man trembles-Redpath !"&#xD;
,edpath !" repeated Ravenclaw, with a&#xD;
searching glance at the half-breed.&#xD;
"Is the .name of Redpath strange to the ears&#xD;
of Ravenclaw .Has he not heard of his deed?,&#xD;
and rejoiced that there was one so during among&#xD;
the warriors of the mighty Dlackfeet ? Is he&#xD;
deaf to the fame of the most dreaded of the red&#xD;
men of his nation "&#xD;
"I know him not," replied Ravenclaw.&#xD;
"My brother's eyes are sharp; he can see a&#xD;
great distance, and he has a cunning under-&#xD;
standing to comprehend that which is hidden,&#xD;
and to know the secrets of his people," continued&#xD;
I3eavertaker, adroitly:&#xD;
"The tongue of Beavertaher is crafty in the&#xD;
use of words, and he goes after secrets like a ser-&#xD;
pent crawling through the grass. But let him&#xD;
beware; they who seek are sometimes found,&#xD;
they who would guide the vengeance of the great&#xD;
?4onito sometimes direct the shaft into their&#xD;
own breasts,"-&#xD;
" It is dangerous then, to-".&#xD;
"'fo seek the trail of Redpath, or to invoke&#xD;
the thunders of his arm. He goes where he&#xD;
will, and strikes because he will; his secret will&#xD;
die with him. He will remain as he is, and no&#xD;
one will be able to boast and say 'I have seen&#xD;
him.' pepart in peace and be not curios g If&#xD;
you would live to eat the fissh of the buffaloes&#xD;
that will soon cover yonder prairies.  Keep&#xD;
your tongue from speaking more than you know,&#xD;
and your ears from hearing too much."&#xD;
IRavenclaw spoke in a tone and manner that&#xD;
gave the half-breed a feeling of uneasiness that&#xD;
he coud not entirely conceal, aodof which he&#xD;
felt ashamed.&#xD;
"You ,9ubtless speak wisely, and is a way&#xD;
honorah to your-great nation. I llopeyou will&#xD;
aid me to strike a blew at our enemies; they are&#xD;
ascending the Nebraska, and will sao he in the&#xD;
mountains."&#xD;
&#xD;
You have just said that my eyes and ears-&#xD;
are open; they are-you have brought me no&#xD;
news."&#xD;
The countenance of Beavertaker evinced sur-&#xD;
prise.&#xD;
" My brother has been active, then; for it will&#xD;
be at least a week before their trail will pass this&#xD;
hut."&#xD;
"And what is a week's travel by those who&#xD;
ride loaded horses, and creep along like snails.&#xD;
There are Blackfeet braves that can journey&#xD;
that distance in two days, and feelno weariness.&#xD;
Our people :never sleep soundly when an ene-&#xD;
my is near."&#xD;
"Ravenclaw is called brave, a successful war-&#xD;
rior, and a good counsellor. Will he de angry&#xD;
if I ask where is the wigwam of the Redpath ?"&#xD;
The stately Indian darted a stem and.menac-&#xD;
ing look at the half breed. -&#xD;
" Son of the pale-face and the red," he retort-&#xD;
ed, in tones of authority mingled. with anger,&#xD;
"you have too much curiosity to be a warrior.&#xD;
What is Redpath to you? heis nought. He is&#xD;
an eagle upon tie mountains that stoops not&#xD;
from his lofty flight to mate with meaner birds.&#xD;
He makes a. swoop and fixes his talons with&#xD;
the speed of lightning; the next moment he&#xD;
is soaring to the sun, or perched iid his eyrie&#xD;
far, far up the inaccessible cliffs. -If you knew&#xD;
his lodge, if you could climb to his high nest,&#xD;
your breath of life would go out befo   or&#xD;
moon. Son of the Frenchman and tIian&#xD;
woman, I can lead you-to the wigwam of lBed-&#xD;
path. By the soul of Monedo, Redpath will die&#xD;
as he has lived, and the eyes of the pale-face&#xD;
shall never look upon his grave,"&#xD;
" Be it so, my brother. I spoke that I might&#xD;
be wiser."&#xD;
"Wiser ! My knowledge of Redpath is noth-&#xD;
ing. I know but his name and the fame of his-&#xD;
deeds. Be not'like the young and foolish who&#xD;
have no wisdom ; but profit by the examples of&#xD;
mighty warriors and conquering chiefs. Go;&#xD;
you will find her you seek with a band of hun-&#xD;
ters encamped yonder toward the sunset. Go,&#xD;
and be wary ; you see that your heart is not big&#xD;
toward the race we abhor."  -&#xD;
Beavertaker-known to the reader as Gar-&#xD;
dette, at Westport-studied for a few Seconds by&#xD;
the fitful fire-light the calm and lofty features of&#xD;
Ravenclaw, then with a compelled feeling of re-&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
SnW MIsroRTUNES..BMPALL oBION'S SAND.&#xD;
IT has been stated that Brn observed that&#xD;
the youthful adventurer who .has twice passed&#xD;
before the reader's imagination, had glanced&#xD;
with some degree of interest at the hatchet that&#xD;
he found so singularly. Falling again in the&#xD;
rear of his band, after Buckeye's departure, he&#xD;
examined the weapon more particularly.  It&#xD;
was- small, and finished with scrupulous neat-&#xD;
ness, smooth as 'the surface of a mirror. It&#xD;
seemed to have but one defect-the handle did&#xD;
not appear sufficiently tight ; and while notic-&#xD;
ing the fact, he discovered a piece of paper be-&#xD;
tween the same and the eye intb which it' was&#xD;
fitted. With the point'of his knife he drew out&#xD;
the paper, and .was astonished to find there was&#xD;
writing upon it, which he hastened to read.&#xD;
"You are closely and perseveringly watched&#xD;
by those who seek the ruin of your enterprise,&#xD;
and who will not hesitate to employ the' niost&#xD;
exceptionable means to ensure their purpose.&#xD;
Be wary, if you would escape- dangers pressing&#xD;
and imminent, and plots the most cunningly&#xD;
devised."&#xD;
" This is extraordinary," exclaimed Briod,&#xD;
when he had read the foregoing lines.&#xD;
"I am closely watched, and am exhorted to&#xD;
be wary.' Who wrote these words of warning ?&#xD;
I would give six months salary to know; they&#xD;
are traced -with a pencil, and ,by a practised&#xD;
hand, too. A plot ! What does that mean? It&#xD;
refers to a rival company,,clearly. Let me see.&#xD;
This was written a week ago, and I have been&#xD;
so stupid asnot to discover it. Two deathshave&#xD;
occurred -since that time-one last night, one&#xD;
the night before. But this is a strange way of&#xD;
communicating  intelligence, and  uncertain,&#xD;
withal, for had I not discovered the hatchet, it&#xD;
might have remained there and the paper with&#xD;
it, so all this good will would have been lost.&#xD;
Who will say that the prairies have not their bit&#xD;
-of romance ? But who comes 4 A'stranger, a&#xD;
white man, a hunter."&#xD;
The man who excited the last remark urged&#xD;
his horse to a gallop as he drew near ; in a few&#xD;
minutes he, was by Brion's side. - The partisan&#xD;
while affecting to regard his approach with in-&#xD;
difference, or as a common-place affair, was really&#xD;
studying his features closely, trying to recall&#xD;
when and under what circumstances he had met&#xD;
rhim.before; for it seemed to him that this was&#xD;
not their first meeting. Having described oth-&#xD;

the air of freedom in a country reaching from&#xD;
sea to sea; and provided by nature with enough&#xD;
to supply the simple necessities of man."  -&#xD;
" You discourselike one to the wilderness born&#xD;
and bred," said the partisan.&#xD;
" That is true. I was born on the border,&#xD;
and have been a rover since a boy. The ways&#xD;
of civilized life in great cities, and busy towns,&#xD;
do not please such as I. The noise of machinery,&#xD;
the smoke of crowded habitations and the artifi-&#xD;
'cialities of modern usages, repel me and make'&#xD;
me more in love with my manner of life," ad-&#xD;
ded Dorelle.&#xD;
"Where have I heard that voice ?" queried&#xD;
Brion. "Have you crossed any Indian trail?"&#xD;
he asked..&#xD;
"Yes, of a large body." -&#xD;
"Of what nation?"&#xD;
"The-most hostile and most dangerous-the&#xD;
Blackfoot."&#xD;
" Which.way did the trail tend ?"&#xD;
"-Off in that direction to our left."&#xD;
"Consequently; to avoid them.-"&#xD;
"You must keep  lose to the mountains one&#xD;
the right."&#xD;
&#xD;
The partisan did not immediately reply; he&#xD;
reflected.&#xD;
" That would seem like rushing into danger.&#xD;
The Blackfeet are wont to lie in wait in yon-&#xD;
der defiles at the base of the mountains," he re-&#xD;
marked, at length, in a careless tone.&#xD;
f 'I know it ; but it would appear from the&#xD;
direction of the trail, that they have changed&#xD;
their tactics."'&#xD;
" That is avery reasonable conclusion," quoth&#xD;
Brion. " To-morrow I must think about chang-&#xD;
ing our course."&#xD;
"It would be prudent ; but a man of expe-&#xD;
rience like you, needs no advice."&#xD;
' Here are my men," said the partisan, as&#xD;
they came up with the rear of that band. " Make&#xD;
yourself at home with them."&#xD;
With these words he spurred forward, and was&#xD;
soon in advance of the foremost of the party,&#xD;
mounting every eminence, crossing every brook,&#xD;
and examining the ground where it was soft&#xD;
enough to yield to the pressure of human feet.&#xD;
While thus actively engaged in reconnoitering,&#xD;
his thoughts were not wholly engrossed with his&#xD;
employment ; they wandered back to Westport,&#xD;
to linger about the; spot where he had seen Mig-&#xD;
non. The clattering of horses' feet recalled his&#xD;
mind to the rough region of reality where his&#xD;
corporeal substance was.&#xD;
" You see we have overtaken you, captain,"&#xD;
said a voice.&#xD;
Brion raised his eyes and perceived several of&#xD;
the more thoughtless young men of-his band, of&#xD;
whom Headley was the leading spirit.&#xD;
" This is imprudent," exclaimed Brion, very&#xD;
sharply. " You had orders not to leave the&#xD;
main body."&#xD;
"And why is it imprudent ?" asked Headley,&#xD;
haughtily, for he liked not the tone of command&#xD;
which the partisan assumed.&#xD;
" It is imprudent, in the first place, because&#xD;
you had my orders to remain with the brigade,&#xD;
and in: the next, for the reason that a party of&#xD;
Blackfeet are lurking in the vicinity," said the&#xD;
mountaineer, firmly.-&#xD;
" 0, is that all?" exclaimed Headley, with a&#xD;
derisive laugh, in which his companions joined.&#xD;
"That is suffcient; I order you to return&#xD;
instantly," rejoined Brion, with a dignified and&#xD;
authoritative air.&#xD;
"Are we then under martial discipline ?"&#xD;
asked Ueadley,adgrily.&#xD;
"You are under my orders, and when I abuse&#xD;
my power,,there will be time enough to rebel.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is my duty to use my authority wheti the gen-&#xD;
eral safety is concerned ; therefore, go back."&#xD;
Three of the refractory . spirits reluctantly&#xD;
turned and sullenly rode toward the brigade,&#xD;
which was about two miles in the rear, while&#xD;
Headley and two others obstinately kept on, dis-&#xD;
regarding orders.&#xD;
" Men, you will regret this I" exclaimed Brion,&#xD;
in a voice free from anger or harshness, yet de-&#xD;
cided and full of meaning.&#xD;
" We will see, we will see 1" retorted Headley,&#xD;
biting his nether lip with vexation.&#xD;
The partisan's frank and manly face grew&#xD;
cloudy.&#xD;
" These green hands," he muttered to himself,&#xD;
"will bring misfortune upon our enterprise. And&#xD;
I am responsible for all that happens. I was a&#xD;
fool to accept this post, but I will be obeyed 1"&#xD;
The mountaineer continued his investigations&#xD;
several hours with all that tact and skill expe-&#xD;
rience had taught him. He was thus busied&#xD;
when he was joined by Buckeye, whose presence&#xD;
at that moment was desirable, as. Brion felt the&#xD;
need of a friend on whom he could rely. They&#xD;
rode on side by side, the latter relating what had&#xD;
passed between him and Headley.      -'&#xD;
" There he is, yonder, waiting for the band to&#xD;
come up," said Buckeye.&#xD;
. "And a few yards before him is one of his&#xD;
foolhardy companions."&#xD;
The partisan'and. Buckeye soon reached the,&#xD;
spot where Headley was sitting.&#xD;
"Where are your friends ?"&#xD;
"If you have eyes, you will see one of them,&#xD;
yonder, seated 4n a rock," he replied.&#xD;
"And the other?"&#xD;
" Is still further ahead, on the other side of&#xD;
the ridge."-&#xD;
" Very well; you 'may consider yourself dis-&#xD;
missed from the employment of the American&#xD;
Fur Company, Mr. Headley. From this mo-&#xD;
ment you are at liberty to go where you please."&#xD;
"What do you say I" cried Headley, disa-&#xD;
greeably astonished.&#xD;
Brion made no answer, and riding on, repeated&#xD;
the same words to the next man, who attempted&#xD;
to stammer forth excuses whichthe partisan did&#xD;
not wait to hear. When he reached the top of&#xD;
the ridge spoken of by Headley, he looked for&#xD;
the third transgressor, whose name was Stringer;&#xD;
but Stringer was not visible.&#xD;
Buckeye hurried forward and descended the&#xD;
slope at a gallop. Before ten minutes had elaps-&#xD;
ed, he called to Brion to come on as fast aS pos-&#xD;
&#xD;
sible. ° Alarmed by the peculiar tones of Buck-&#xD;
eye's voice, the mountaineer struck the spurs&#xD;
into his horse and dashed down the ridge. He&#xD;
found the trapper leaning over the pommel of&#xD;
his saddle, with pale cheeks and dilated eyes.&#xD;
Upon the ground at the fore feet of Flash, was&#xD;
stretched the unfortunate Stringer ; he was lying&#xD;
on his back, the blood had receded from his face,&#xD;
his lips were white, and he was gasping in the&#xD;
last extremity. Brion sprang from his horse,&#xD;
but the man was dead before he reached him.&#xD;
The mountaineers gazed at the corpse with&#xD;
feelings of indescribable awe. There was some-&#xD;
thing crushing in the thought that a man who a&#xD;
moment since was full of life and youthful fire,&#xD;
was now but a clod, powerless, inert.&#xD;
Come in what form he will, death takes men&#xD;
by surprise ; he arrives too soon-is always&#xD;
grind and terrible. Let him come in sudden-&#xD;
ness and mystery, when mortals have no intima-&#xD;
tion of his 'approach, taking one whose life seems&#xD;
good for many years, and he is doubly fearful.&#xD;
Brion and"Buckeye were still contemplating&#xD;
the yet warm body, when Headley and his com-&#xD;
rade came up ; they had heard the trapper's call&#xD;
to Brion, and were suspicious that something&#xD;
strange had occurred.   Drawing near with&#xD;
downcast, anxious looks, they beheld the spec-&#xD;
tacle that kept the tongues of the mountaineers&#xD;
mute.   Headley was astounded ; his visage&#xD;
grew as pallid as the ashy features of Stringer.&#xD;
He allowed the bridle rein to fall from his grasp,&#xD;
and with glassy eyes and parted lips, stared at&#xD;
the stiffening body of hitn who a few minutes&#xD;
ago was riding -gaily'at'his side. An inexplica-&#xD;
ble dread fastened upon his heart ; an indefina-&#xD;
ble trembling seized his limbs. He seemed to&#xD;
see an - unknown danger approaching in circles&#xD;
that every instant lessened their diameter.- In&#xD;
the ghastly face of Stringer he fancied he saw&#xD;
his own fate. Like him he should be stricken by&#xD;
an unknown dart, and like him be gazed at by eyes&#xD;
dilated with terror; like him be buried on the&#xD;
prairies and left to eternal solitude.&#xD;
Brion gave him a reproachful look-a look&#xD;
which accused him of being an accessory to his&#xD;
comrade's death.&#xD;
"Do you see this ?" said the partisan, when&#xD;
the silence had become oppressive.&#xD;
Headley made an affirmative sign.&#xD;
"And do you remember that I warned you of&#xD;
the danger of leaving the'party ?" continued the&#xD;
captain, with cold severity.&#xD;
The Missourian sat motionless in his saddle.&#xD;

&#xD;
"You claim some knowledge of surgery. -Do&#xD;
you wish to examine this body ?"  resumed&#xD;
Brion.&#xD;
Headley shook his head like one who wishes&#xD;
to say, " I have had enough of that; it is of no&#xD;
use."&#xD;
Buckeye was sitting calmly upon his horse ;&#xD;
he now darted a meaning glance at Headley&#xD;
from under his heavy brows; it needed no in-&#xD;
terpreter-,-he undergood its signification perfect-&#xD;
ly ; it asked him if he' was satisfied i if he be-&#xD;
lieved there were others who knew as maeh as&#xD;
he did.&#xD;
"Have you an explanation to offer ?" added&#xD;
the partisan.,&#xD;
"No," replied Headley, "I have nothing to&#xD;
say."&#xD;
" Not so with me," said Buckeye. "I have&#xD;
a few words to say, which may perhaps make&#xD;
our wise friend from Missouri a trifle wiser--&#xD;
if that's possible. I'm prettyssartin that my&#xD;
opinion on many pints isn't worth a charge of&#xD;
powder ; but what I know, I'm sure of. Now,&#xD;
sir, (looking at Headley), if you want to discover&#xD;
whether Stringer died of a disease of the head&#xD;
or heart, you shall be gratified."&#xD;
Then addressing Brion :&#xD;
" I said I had a secret to tell you, to-morrow,&#xD;
but seeing what's happened, I wont keep it any&#xD;
longer, for there'll never be a better time."&#xD;
To Headley again:&#xD;
"Now, sir, examine Stringer's head."&#xD;
The Missourian dismounted, and resting one&#xD;
knee on the ground, lifted $trieger's head, and&#xD;
holding it with the palnQf his left hand,scruti-&#xD;
nized it closely.&#xD;
I see nothing," he, affirmed.&#xD;
"Part the hair just above his right aer, and&#xD;
you will find the head of a steel arrow driven&#xD;
through the skull into the brain," said Buceee.&#xD;
"It is so," exclaimed Headley.&#xD;
"And yet there is no blood to indicate a mor-&#xD;
tal wound," said Brion.&#xD;
"The hair is saturatedvery little underneath,&#xD;
newt the skin," replied Headley; "but the fact&#xD;
that there is no hemorrhage is easily accounted&#xD;
for. The arrow-head is not much large] than a&#xD;
lady's bodkin, and makes but a mere puncture&#xD;
in the skin; -leing driven with great, force it&#xD;
penetrates deeply into the brain, causing instant&#xD;
paralysis of all the vital fnetions."  ,&#xD;
" That certainly seems to be an arrowheadd"&#xD;
said Headley's friend,  "But where is the&#xD;
shaft ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" Look once more," added Buckeye.&#xD;
Readley passed the point of a penknife into&#xD;
the scarcely perceptible wound, feeling carefully&#xD;
over the steel surface.&#xD;
" It may be so contrived," he said, when he&#xD;
had reflected a moment, " that the shaft could be&#xD;
detached, after driving the point to its fatal des-&#xD;
tination,"&#xD;
" Or broken off," suggested Headley's friend.&#xD;
" And the shaft, what becomes of that ?" que-&#xD;
ried Brion, looking at Buckeye.&#xD;
" One thing's sartin; it isn't to be seen in this&#xD;
case, and it was so in the other too; so we can&#xD;
form what opinion appears most nat'ral. I dare&#xD;
say the cunnin' reptile as did this, broke off the&#xD;
shaft and carried it away, as an act of bravado,&#xD;
as well as to mystify and make things look un-&#xD;
accountable."&#xD;
" I will see if he comes and goes without a&#xD;
trail," said Brion, throwing the bridle rein to&#xD;
Buckeye.&#xD;
" Remain just where you are, men, that no&#xD;
new track may be made," he added, commenc-&#xD;
ing a close Investigation of the ground, which&#xD;
continued until the entire party came up. The,&#xD;
foremost, hearing what had happened, commu-&#xD;
nicated it to those next to them, and the news&#xD;
ran quickly from mouth to mouth until all were&#xD;
in possession of it. While those in the rear&#xD;
were pressing to the scene of the catastrophe, the&#xD;
partisan approached Buckeye, and said, in a low&#xD;
tone :&#xD;
" I wish you to watch the stranger who joined&#xD;
us to-day. Keep your eyes on him when he looks&#xD;
at Stringer's body, and is hearing the circum-&#xD;
stances that attended his death."&#xD;
The trapper made a sign that he would do so.&#xD;
Dorelle was in no hurry, being the last to ap-&#xD;
proach the corpse. When he beheld the white&#xD;
,and rigid Face, he shuddered and drew back, as&#xD;
if the spectacle was more shocking than he had&#xD;
anticipated.  Buckeye observed him closely&#xD;
while the story of the steel-arrow was being told&#xD;
by those who had first reached the spot. That&#xD;
it produced in his mind feelings of unfeigned&#xD;
astonishment, the trapper did not doubt, his de-&#xD;
meanor attesting'it in every natural way.&#xD;
There' was now. ample subject for conversa-&#xD;
tiou among the trappers, young and old, confess-&#xD;
ing the same interest, the same awe. Stringer&#xD;
was buried as his. companions had been, the&#xD;
mountaineers. resuming their long and weary&#xD;
march with saddened :hearts and clouded-faces,&#xD;
pondering darkly on the fate of Stringer, ask-&#xD;
&#xD;
'ng whose turn would come next, eeh mutually&#xD;
sawing: "It may he me."&#xD;
Teadley, on whop the incident of the day&#xD;
head made a deep impression, rode up to llrion&#xD;
the, moment an opportunity offered whey he&#xD;
could address him alone.&#xD;
" I owe you en apology,,captain," he said,&#xD;
"for my folly, and I hope you will he disposed&#xD;
to overlook what has passed. I. acknowledge&#xD;
that I merited reproach, and the death of String-&#xD;
er is a rebuke that will cause me sorrow so long&#xD;
as I live."&#xD;
"I restore you to your place, Mr. Headley,&#xD;
and your friend, too ; and will attribute your&#xD;
conduct to' thoughtlessness, rather than obsti-&#xD;
nacy," replied the partisan, with that franknes&#xD;
that characterized him.&#xD;
Headley thanked him and hastened to inform&#xD;
his refractory companion of the result of his&#xD;
apology.&#xD;
Brion ordered a halt in the afternoon, for the&#xD;
purpose of hunting the buffalo, having killed&#xD;
but one since leaving fort Laramie. A few of&#xD;
the most skilful hunters were sent out, the re-&#xD;
mainder of the band being strictly enjoined to&#xD;
keep within certain precincts ; an injunction that&#xD;
the leader had no difficulty in enforcing, seh a&#xD;
dread of their mysterious enemy had fallen on&#xD;
them. The hunt not proving successful, it was&#xD;
resolved to continue it during the next day;&#xD;
therefore their encampment was made to assume&#xD;
a more permanent appearance. Being in a dan-&#xD;
gerous neighborhood, a corral was built for the&#xD;
horses, and various precautionary measures were&#xD;
men:&#xD;
As the night drew on, Brion gbaerved that&#xD;
many of the men grew anxious, even some of&#xD;
the veterans; so much had the fate of Strigger&#xD;
sp'ected them. Within the corral, which was&#xD;
considerable large, a smaller enclosure was ,made&#xD;
by placing the trunks of cottoti-woods horison-&#xD;
tally on the ground ones upon the other, until&#xD;
they reached as high as the breast of  man of&#xD;
ordinary height. Behind that shelter they hop-&#xD;
ed to escape the skill of their inexplicable adver -&#xD;
sary. We must, however, except ths prgsan&#xD;
.d Buckeye from tho number who entertained&#xD;
the idea of passing the night behind such a shel-&#xD;
ter; he had other thoughts.-&#xD;
"look," said he to Buckeye, "the sa is&#xD;
sinking majestically upon the prairies; it is not&#xD;
easy to. dispel the illusion that it will gotrest on&#xD;
this m  hty .level, instead f pasug to another .&#xD;
hemisphere to illumi mte Qther gertals-to ahie.&#xD;
&#xD;
on other cities and peoples, mountains, lakes&#xD;
And rivers"&#xD;
"That was my owe thought," replied the&#xD;
other; " but it woujd save been .morally, a4-&#xD;
possible for a ,rpugh old feller like me to ex-&#xD;
press it in such a way. RUman creturs may he&#xD;
constituted pretty ncar alikq, cap'n, as to the&#xD;
real men, but we haven't all the same fakilty of&#xD;
.expressiop. .Now that uat'rally reminds me of&#xD;
death, when the sun of life seems to he going&#xD;
down into the airtb, so to speak, to be buried&#xD;
and extinguished 'forever. To all appearance,&#xD;
what there is of sueh s you end I ceases to he,&#xD;
is put into the ground to be compounded again&#xD;
with theeternal elements, to play its part in otl-&#xD;
er forss, tilltime shall be no longer. But cap'n,&#xD;
there may be sythiu' that rises like the sun, like&#xD;
it to shine forever in another region."&#xD;
" God knows how fervently I hope so ," ex-&#xD;
claimed Brion, " To believe that Stringer has&#xD;
a Consciousness at this moment, like yours and&#xD;
mine, as full, as perfect, would almost console&#xD;
one for his death ; nay, it would quite."&#xD;
"Poor Stringer !" sighed Buckeye.&#xD;
"I don't know whether to say poor Stringer or&#xD;
not !" said hirion, impressively, looking up sol-&#xD;
emnly into the cloudless sky. " By heavens, he&#xD;
may be better off at this instant than you or I.&#xD;
I sometimes wish that the arrowaof Redpath&#xD;
might enter my own brain, and thus dismiss me&#xD;
from care and pain."&#xD;
"Pain and care ! what pain and care should&#xD;
one like yot have, cap'n ? perhaps you lost your&#xD;
heart at Westport ?" rejoined Buckeye,&#xD;
The paltisa blushed-,-sn assertion that may&#xD;
perhaps appear well nigh incredible to the read-&#xD;
er i but it has been proved numeberless times&#xD;
that the man who em faae a eatery or anra-&#xD;

"You are getting slang to fast, my friend.&#xD;

The trapper declared that tp love fair maiden&#xD;
was not to tran gsess laws; frine or human,&#xD;
" The men are gloomy,"spd Brion, abruptly.&#xD;
"'Tis mt raeap'n after w4ats happened.&#xD;

be many of them left. Each one says, 'I, too,&#xD;

row in my head.' Now sich' an idea as that,&#xD;
when it fairly -gets possession of a seller's mind,&#xD;
can't be' considered very cheerin', accordin' to&#xD;
my view of matters gin'rally, though you may&#xD;
have different notions, bein' better eddicated."&#xD;
"By my faith !" exclaimed the partisan, "you&#xD;
are about right ; the idea of being dogged by a&#xD;
single enemy, and picked off one by one at his&#xD;
leisure is not pleasant. So far as the mere fact&#xD;
of dying is concerned, one could not choose an&#xD;
easier death; but people seldom reach that pe-&#xD;
riod when they are willing to submit to even&#xD;
the easiest death that can be contrived. The&#xD;
love of life is strong,and follows one alike through&#xD;
happiness and misery. Come now, good Buck-&#xD;
eye, tell me if you are yourself ready to offer&#xD;
your head to the fatal skill of Redpath?"&#xD;
"'By the beard of Joe Smith, noi I prefer to&#xD;
keep my upper story unbroken, and in a condi-&#xD;
tion to be useful. You forget that I have a&#xD;
friend to provide for ?"&#xD;
"A friend ?"&#xD;
"Yes, and a good one too ; there he stands,&#xD;
yonder,-eating grass like Nebuchadnezzar."&#xD;
" 0, you mean Flash !"&#xD;
",Yes, Flash-a creetur that has all thebetter&#xD;
qualities of the human species, with a great deal&#xD;
more speed."&#xD;
"He is certainly swift of -foot," said -Brion,&#xD;
with a smile.&#xD;
".The name of Redpath has'often been men-&#xD;
tioned between you and I, and you once did me&#xD;
the favor to ask my opinion consarnin' him; now&#xD;
I want to put the same question to you, for I've&#xD;
observed that you've been non-committal and on&#xD;
the'fence, as 'twere, retpectin'*him."-&#xD;
"I will be very frank, Buckeye, and keep'&#xD;
nothing-from you. That we are followed by a&#xD;
vengeful enemy, is indisputable; that this en-&#xD;
emy is cunning beyond anyI ever encountered,&#xD;
I also freely'admit;- but if it be the famedBlack-&#xD;
foot chief called Redpath,' I have no' means&#xD;
whatever of knowing. Familiar as the name 'of&#xD;
Redpath is to me I will avow to you that have,&#xD;
from the first, been inclined to consider himi but&#xD;
the creation of some wonder-lovingbrain."&#xD;
"You feel positifel f sai'tin that three of your&#xD;
party have been killed," said Buckeye, sarcasti-&#xD;
cally, rather, for him.'&#xD;
The partisan answered in the affirmative, but&#xD;
added that they might have been killed; not by&#xD;
one savage, but possibly by'three.'&#xD;
&#xD;
" That isn't altogether probable ; a party of&#xD;
three would have more difkilty in concealing&#xD;
their trail than one, as you'll understand at once,&#xD;
when you come to think of it., Agin; this sort&#xD;
of thing is done by one who has served a long&#xD;
apprenticeship at it, so to speak ; otherwise he&#xD;
couldn't have acquired that awful sartinty that&#xD;
charaktarizes him. Depend on't, it's done by a-&#xD;
riptile as has follered it for months, perhaps for&#xD;
years, growin' more and more acute, cunnin'&#xD;
and terrible."&#xD;
" Your reasoning is just; this marvellous act&#xD;
of approaching an encampment, this wondrous&#xD;
power of striking a victim with a precision that&#xD;
is deadly, and retreating without leaving trail or&#xD;
other sign than a dead body,,is really startling,&#xD;
and well nigh staggers belief; but I am resolved&#xD;
to solve the apparently inexplicable mystery."&#xD;
"Beware !" exclaimed the trapper, "beware&#xD;
what you do !"&#xD;
" What! does a brave man as I have consid-&#xD;
ered you to be, hold a single savage-armed, as&#xD;
it would seem, with a bow and arrow, in such&#xD;
dread ?" said the partisan.&#xD;
" Tell me who and where my enemy is, and I&#xD;
am not afraid to meet him ; but it is embar-&#xD;
rassin', to say the least, to seek a riptile who has&#xD;
the fakilty of makin' hisself invisible, who&#xD;
walks round ye without makin' anytrack, who&#xD;
kills ye afore you know he's near, who's off afore&#xD;
you've gasped away the breath of life. Where'll&#xD;
you go to find him?  Will it be east or west,&#xD;
north or south,' this way or that ? You can't&#xD;
tell, because you don't know when you've found&#xD;
him ? What assurance have ye that he wont&#xD;
see you first ?" '&#xD;
"There are difficulties to be considered, and&#xD;
obstacles to surmount, but courage and a strong&#xD;
will can accomplish what, at first thought, ap-&#xD;
pears impossible," returned Briot, firmly.&#xD;
" If courage and a strong will can do so much,&#xD;
cap'n, why don't they keep the creetur away&#xD;
from the camp-fires at night?  Why don't cout-&#xD;
age and a strong will prevent .him from killin'&#xD;
your men?"&#xD;
Buckeye looked triumphantly at the partisan,&#xD;
who listened with interest to the development&#xD;
of the trapper's feelings, which he was internally,&#xD;
determined he should lay bare.&#xD;
" Until to-day, we have had but little warning&#xD;
of the presence'"of such a foe.- The singular ab-&#xD;
sence of wounds in the two first cases let- some&#xD;
doubt on the mind in regard to the causf their,&#xD;
death, and it is only a few hours since the mys-&#xD;
&#xD;
REDPATH.&#xD;
&#xD;
tery was cleared up. I shall now use every pre&#xD;
caution to prevent the recurrence of similar vis&#xD;
itations, that experience and prudence can de&#xD;
vise; but it is a humiliating thought that seventh&#xD;
men are forced to extraordinary measures fo&#xD;
protection against a singlesavage arm ; it shame&#xD;
me, Buckeye, and makes me doubt that I hav&#xD;

gers are thick, and skill is indispensable. If]&#xD;
do not put a stop to this, the name of Ben&#xD;
Brion will cease to be quoted as a brave and&#xD;
sagacious man, fit to command in the mos&#xD;
trying emergencies."&#xD;
" Don't lay it so much to heart, for you ain&#xD;
without witnesses that you've been prudent as&#xD;
a human being' could be, inder the circumstances&#xD;
Human foresight can't foresee everything."&#xD;
"If matters progress as they have begun, my&#xD;
witnesses will be dumb ones," said Brion, with&#xD;
a smile.       ,,&#xD;
"And deaf, too," quoth Buckeye.&#xD;
"I think I may trust you ?" resumed the&#xD;
partisan.&#xD;
" You can't tell till you try me," returned&#xD;
the trapper, drily.&#xD;
"I wish to tell you-.--move this way a little,&#xD;
the very person I was going to speak of is watch-&#xD;
ing us-that I am suspicious, of the good faith&#xD;
of this stranger, Dorelle. If you were to ask&#xD;
my reasons, I am very sure I should :not be able&#xD;
to give them. I shall watch;him."&#xD;
"I'll take him in hand, too, 'cap'u, andsee&#xD;
what I can make of him. If I discover, mischief&#xD;
in him, he'd better be among the Blaekfeet or&#xD;
the Apaches," said;Buckeye, determinedly.-,&#xD;
: " He isto be depended 'on; if ever mani-was&#xD;
trustworthy," said Brion to himself,;as he walk-,&#xD;

done according to his orders ; the remark refer-&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
GOLDI-HUNTLNG IS TALKRDJ OF.,&#xD;
EVENING name., The hunters and trappers&#xD;
were gatheredabout'the eamp-fires in -groups,&#xD;
cooking their supper,:discussing the alhengms.&#xD;
ing 'suject of theday. Each in, turn gave his&#xD;
opinion, hazarded a conjectureor recited some&#xD;
startling tale, of :Indian' cunning and eruelty4&#xD;
The youn-g men of the band had less'to saythanu&#xD;
usual; 'their"ardor was cooled; theyfervently&#xD;
wishedthetselves within thepale of civilization&#xD;
agaid, no longer finding fault at the lack of in'&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
- cident that attended their march. The faces of&#xD;
Stringer, Minten and, Townsend were constant-&#xD;
ly before them, reviving and keeping vivid'the&#xD;
y mystery of their death, the awful suddenness of&#xD;
r their departure.&#xD;
s   "It would appear," said Headley, "that we&#xD;
e are destined to fall by the wayside, one at a&#xD;
- time. We shall mark each day's journey by a&#xD;
I grave."&#xD;
" That is true," responded. a young man by&#xD;
- the name of 'Conroy, who but two days before&#xD;
t had complained of the monotony of their jour-&#xD;
ney, and its paucity of adventure.&#xD;
t   "I wonder," resumed Headley, as if talking to&#xD;
s himself, "if, we were hired for the purpose of&#xD;
- being shot in-the head with a steel-arrow ?"&#xD;
The query, though addressed to no one in par-&#xD;
ticular, caught like' a train of powder, just as it&#xD;
was intended. The short but expressive mono-&#xD;
syllable "Noo," made the .circuit of the group in&#xD;
an instant.&#xD;
" That is my own opinion," added Headley.&#xD;
"I have from the first, entertained the idea,&#xD;
that our services were engaged to trap and hunt."&#xD;
" In course," said Conroy, sullenly.&#xD;
"But it's too late, now, I, suppose, t !  ve&#xD;
ourselves. Seeing, we must all succumb to the&#xD;
foul fiend that dogs us, sooner or later, I expect&#xD;
we must make the best of it.. It would be well,&#xD;
however, to suggest to the captain to dig a grave&#xD;
every night, so that our march wont be delayed&#xD;
in the morning. We could then look in each&#xD;
other's faces andseem to realize that one of us is&#xD;
actually tremblingon the boundary of the 'other&#xD;
world."&#xD;
"God save me from such a realization for&#xD;
many a year!" exclaimed Conroy, glancing&#xD;
around uneasily.&#xD;
'" 0, it is an easy-r death," added Headley,&#xD;
adroitly,:knowing well how to excite the fears of&#xD;
his, comrades.,&#xD;
"If youacovet such a fate, seek it; but it flls&#xD;
me with unspeakable dread!" cried Conroy, with&#xD;
"It is so sudden, that one has no chance to&#xD;
repent,"paid'Porelle, whohad joined the group.&#xD;
The young $rappers looked encouragingly at&#xD;
their new ally.&#xD;

different direction from our present route,&#xD;
through the countries of savage nations-the&#xD;
ttahs, the Navajoes, the Pimos, the Maricopos,&#xD;
and lastly, the famous Apaches."&#xD;
A c tltd of disappointment passed over Head-&#xD;
Ay's face the distance and danger startled him&#xD;
and depressed his hopes.&#xD;
" You ssare speaking of that region lying, be.&#xD;
tween New Msexico and the Great Basin-th0&#xD;
country of an extinct nation-the Aztec?" he&#xD;
added.&#xD;
.  Yet, the land of the ancient Aztec, traces of&#xD;
kyhose art and industry yet remain."&#xD;
"Ha     ndyou ever been thefe, Mods. Dorelle "&#xD;
"I have passed months there; traversed its&#xD;
vales s and ruountains, seen its rivers, gazed&#xD;
with awe upon the CasS'Monttaneula"&#xD;
" 1ifngined that was a fabulous'fabric, exist-&#xD;

"Ah, ny friend, you see before you a man,&#xD;

grim, grey yet gloomy,: silent yet speakltg alIan-&#xD;
guage not to be misiaterpreted,.telling of en-&#xD;

Dorelle spoke with apparent' enthusiasm, and&#xD;
was now the central point of attraction to the&#xD;
, wondering-group. The niet gathered round him&#xD;
as if heweke an oracle, tilocking, the past as&#xD;
well arlaying open-the-fatire. Onewho has the&#xD;

ifn;the marvel of the inexpeteIned a d5sank&#xD;
ine, .    ewho-sat that night at the camp4fir'of he&#xD;
&#xD;
"A vast region of ruins and hidden wealth is&#xD;
that country," added Dorelle." The treasures of&#xD;
an extinct race are concealed ingeniously be-&#xD;
neath walls now crumbling, and buried in earth,&#xD;
now overgrown with rank w9eds, with the mez-&#xD;
quit, the parasitic vine, the  d sage, and the&#xD;
dwarf pine. Foudre t it setsmy blood in a hot&#xD;
fever to think of it. A few hardy, adventurous&#xD;
men, a little faith, with boldness.and persever-&#xD;
ance, wpuld suffice to acquire those riches. I&#xD;
have sought such persons, but* upon my honor,&#xD;
messieurs, I cannot find them; or rather I can-&#xD;
not make them have confidence in the treasures&#xD;
of that country."&#xD;
"You shall soon cease to complain, Monsieur&#xD;
Dorelle 1" cried Headley, looking at his friends.&#xD;
" Here are those who have not only faith but&#xD;
resolution. Discontented with their present cir-&#xD;
cumstances, they wait but opportunity to change&#xD;
their course and their prospects. Tell me, sir,&#xD;
can the dangers you refbr to be greater than&#xD;
that strange fatality that now follows in our trail&#xD;
like the angel of death, transfixing one and ano-&#xD;
ther with his dart ?"&#xD;
A visible tremor shook Dorelle's person.&#xD;
"Not half so fearful," he replied, in a voice&#xD;
sunken almost to a whisper. "I can conceive of&#xD;
nothing more diabolical than the systematic kill-&#xD;
ing of this savage or devil, or whatever he may&#xD;
chance to be. Being naturally superstitious, I&#xD;
acknowledge that I have much difficulty in per-&#xD;
suading myself that this pathless, trackless power&#xD;
is human. Ah, messieurs, they may call him&#xD;
Redpath, if they will, but to me he is a demon."&#xD;
"That's what I say !" exclaimed Conroy,&#xD;
striking his right knee violently with the corres-&#xD;
ponding hand, to give proper energy to his&#xD;
words.&#xD;
"And I, also," said Loretto, a. Mexican, and,&#xD;
Violett, a Creole, and half a dozen others-&#xD;
"This is gratifying !" exclaimed Dorelle. "I&#xD;
expected'to. become an object of ridicule among&#xD;
you, after°making- such an avowal; but I am.&#xD;
agreeably disappoiritede I ai *a catholic, mess-&#xD;
sieurs, a staunch believer-in the devil, and that&#xD;
the devil' sometimes assists hit instruments, i&#xD;
the flesh."&#xD;
"No doubt of it ," mutteined Loretto, cfitsn g&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
"My lads" said eadley, what'say you to&#xD;
turning our footsteps toward' Gilt eIve' in&#xD;
search of treasure?"&#xD;
"I care not whither we go, providing we but&#xD;
&#xD;
change our course," responded Conroy, and&#xD;
several others.&#xD;
"'Will you lead us there, if we can enlist&#xD;
enough in our-interest to make the expedition&#xD;
promising ?" asked the Missourian, again turn-&#xD;
ing to Dorelle.&#xD;
" Gladly 1" he answered, emphatically.&#xD;
" Who will go ? who will go ?" cried Headley,&#xD;
with enthusiastic eagerness. "'Come, let those&#xD;
who will go, speak-and speak in earnest I"&#xD;
Ten persons, comprising all in the group, in-&#xD;
stantly signified their willingness to follow Do-&#xD;
relle, and desert Brion.&#xD;
" Warn them to be cautions, and not let their&#xD;
intentions be known," whispered Dorelle to the&#xD;
Missourian, who immediately gave instructions&#xD;
to that effect, which they promised to observe.&#xD;
",One thing we have overlooked; we need an&#xD;
outfit to undertake such a long and trying expe-&#xD;
dition ; all these things around us, we must bear&#xD;
in mind, belong to the American Fur Company,&#xD;
and not to us."&#xD;
"I can assist you somewhat in regard to that,"&#xD;
said Dorelle. "I have a cache, fortunately, pro-&#xD;
vided for this very object."&#xD;
" If we were not where we are, I should cry&#xD;
three cheers for Monsieur Dorelle,"' said Head-&#xD;
ley, joyfully. "Now, my friends, fortune and&#xD;
adventure are before us," he added, with an en-&#xD;
thusiasm he did not attempt to disguise, and&#xD;
which his companions shared.&#xD;
Buckeye, during this conversation, was sleep-&#xD;
ing (or seemed' to be) on a pile of packs and&#xD;
saddles, a few yards distant; his proximity was&#xD;
either not known or not cared for. Flash ap.&#xD;
broached his-master, and smelled round him, as&#xD;
if to assure himfelt that he was there, and his&#xD;
footsteps had' the effect to- arouse him. He arose&#xD;
to his elbow, rubbed his eyes, then spoke to hi&#xD;
horse, and finally walked to another part of the&#xD;
qncamptisent&#xD;
Brion, meantime, had left the corral, having&#xD;
gIlen such directions as he deemed necessary for&#xD;
the efety of all. The fatality attending his&#xD;
mrch, weighed heavily upon his mind. As cap.&#xD;
gaa, orparisa l he was responsible for the safe.&#xD;

&#xD;
ure through the agency of a single savage, arm-&#xD;
ed, as it would seem, with a bow and arrow?&#xD;
The partisan was ready to pluck out his hair&#xD;
with vexation. As he had stated t9 Buckeye,&#xD;
he was mortified and humiliated beyond mea-&#xD;
sure. It made his cheeks redden with shame to&#xD;
anticipate, even, being thoughtweak and pusil-&#xD;
lanimous. He believed it would certainly be&#xD;
said that he was wanting in energy, promptness&#xD;
and foresight. What a thing to be said of Ben&#xD;
Brion-a man who had been on the trail ever&#xD;
since he left school, a mere boy !&#xD;
He paced slowly about the encampment, far&#xD;
enough from it not to be seen.&#xD;
"Perchance," he said, to himself, "my own&#xD;
brain may be pierced by the shaft of this secret&#xD;
foe. Be it thus ; I alone will expose myself to&#xD;
his aim this night. If he, has the temerity to&#xD;
approach one whose eyes are quick to trace a&#xD;
trail, and whose ears are educated ,to hear an&#xD;
enemy, let him look to it; he may perhaps re-&#xD;
gret his boldness! Ah, I am forgetting his fatal&#xD;
skill, his deadly cunning !"&#xD;
The partisan sighed, and thought of Mignon.&#xD;
" It might have been-itmight heve been !"&#xD;
he added, in a low tone, that savored much of&#xD;
sadness. What it was that "might have been"&#xD;
he did not say, but instantly shaking off his&#xD;
dreaminess, began to act the keen and watchful&#xD;
scout, a thing which a sojourn of over, ten years&#xD;
in the mountains had rendered easy, ,n4 which,&#xD;
hitherto, had been attended with a kind of plea-&#xD;
sure ; but, this was before he met Mignon, and&#xD;
lost his heart, since which event he. had experi-&#xD;
euced less happiness in the practice of his wan-&#xD;
dering trade., Mignon followed him everywhere;&#xD;
Mignon was, tireless in pursuing hin; Mignon&#xD;
was with him in his dresins; she was  fair but&#xD;
eyer present spirit, that could not be laid.&#xD;
The realization of all this revealed the moun-&#xD;
taineer to himself in a new light. He had not&#xD;
supposed it quite possible;thahetagpgdbe capti-&#xD;
vated by a pretty fage, and so enslaved by the.&#xD;
charming conqueror; it was a new revelation,,&#xD;
an hitherto unread page in i4 ownaracter,&#xD;
He believed his passion hqppeis, andeot:94ny&#xD;
hopeless but fooligh, extremely., ,He didnot ex.&#xD;

,Although reflpetigps likthes9w i, deeming.&#xD;
through Brion's brain,,it did notdyertli fsom&#xD;
his duty; he kept his daggeroug*lgils VO  fir&#xD;
nesp and skill, exposing Ihel thusvolutarily&#xD;
to be faithful to his trust, and save those under&#xD;
&#xD;
his direction. Men are apt to think soberly and&#xD;
rationally in the silence and quietude of night,&#xD;
and it was thus with the partisan. He asked&#xD;
what or who it was that he feared; or, more&#xD;
properly, that threatened the destruction ofhis&#xD;
trappers and hunters. He had heard the name&#xD;
of Redpath spoken often in the mountains, while&#xD;
encamped by lonely streams and distant soli-&#xD;
tudes ; sturdy veterans had recounted his deeds,&#xD;
while friendly Indians told of his cunning, attri'&#xD;
buting hissuccess to the interposition of Ma-&#xD;
chinito-the bad spirit; but how much of this did&#xD;
he credit?  What had happened under his own&#xD;
observation to prove that these tales were not&#xD;
without foundation; that there was really truth&#xD;
in what mountain rumor had been telling so&#xD;
long in the defiles and passes?  Brion consid-&#xD;
ered the subject from various points, concluding&#xD;
this ordeal of self-examination by confessing a&#xD;
belief in Redpath. It was midnight when he&#xD;
reached that ultimatum. The stillness of the&#xD;
night had remained unbroken, save by the bark&#xD;
of the prairie dog, or the howl of the wolf-&#xD;
those constant attendants of the mountaineer in&#xD;
his lengthened pilgrimages across a mighty coun-&#xD;
try ; where, in the revelations of yearsPsman&#xD;
cities are to rise, and the genius of civihation&#xD;
is to walk with foot untiring-.&#xD;
The partisan stood with his head thrown for-&#xD;
ward, all his senses awake to detect the slightest&#xD;
sound. An owl emitted its ominous cry, which,&#xD;
echo caught and prolonged in a series of mourn-&#xD;
ful wailings, which died away in the valleys and&#xD;
far-off passes.&#xD;
"Ah !" exclaimed Brion, without changing&#xD;
his position.&#xD;
He waited for something-apparently the re-&#xD;
petition of the cry,-but it came'not. He cast&#xD;
his eyes toirard the encampmertt; the -moon-&#xD;
beadis Wereelying tranquilly upon it ; the stars&#xD;
twinkled overhead serenely, as if bidding the&#xD;
weary to forget care and sleep.&#xD;
Brions attention was yet fixed on the en-&#xD;
campruent, when- oksaw a man leaving the car-&#xD;
rol.. Had he walked ont boldly and carelessly,&#xD;
the :paitisa's Suspicions would not have been'&#xD;
aroused; but he-stole outas a thief might leave&#xD;
the scene of his depredations.&#xD;
"Monest men 4p pot move in that way," mut-&#xD;
tered Brion..&#xD;
At that momept the owl -hooted again, more&#xD;
logd aut4auily ta before.. Clear of the cor-&#xD;
ral, the man advanced cautiously toward the&#xD;
spot where the mountaineer was. standing ; the&#xD;
&#xD;
latter instantly changed his position, screening&#xD;
himself behind the trunk of a cypress. It was&#xD;
Dorelle who approached, as Brion very 'soon&#xD;
discovered.&#xD;
"Yes, Monsieur Dorelle, you are the one I&#xD;
intended to watch," thought the hunter, as the&#xD;
Frenchman passed his hiding-place. Brion fol-&#xD;
lowed him toward the Wind River range, from&#xD;
the margin of the prairie upon which his camp&#xD;
had been pitched, into a tract of country cut up&#xD;
by gulleys, broken by sharp hills, covered with&#xD;
pinon, stunted oaks and aspen.&#xD;
Dorelle stopped and remained motionless for&#xD;
several minutes. Presently the owl hooted ;&#xD;
Dorelle barked like a prairie dog, and went on.&#xD;
The cry of the owl came from a canon, not far&#xD;
beyond ; it was toward the canon that Dorelle&#xD;
hastened.&#xD;
"Now," mused Brion, " we will learn what&#xD;
this signalizing is for."&#xD;
The ground between them and the canon was&#xD;
soon traversed. Dorelle barked again, and the&#xD;
owl hooted but a few paces from him.&#xD;
" Is it you, Gardette ?" asked Dorelle.&#xD;
"It is I, Monsieur Mariot," replied Gar-&#xD;
dette, or Beavertaker, as we shall prefer to call&#xD;
him, in honor to his Indian relatives.&#xD;
"Ah," exclaimed Brion, again-an innocent&#xD;
exclamation that he was in the habit of using&#xD;
when surprised ; for the partisan never employ-&#xD;
ed oaths, even when excited.&#xD;
Mariot and Beavertaker advanced and met.&#xD;
"I have many things to inquire about," said&#xD;
the former. "How do yo~u succeed with the&#xD;
Blackfeet ?"&#xD;
"At first I was looked upon with distrust, but&#xD;
my wife at length restored confidence ; so you&#xD;
see it is a good thing to have an Indian wife,&#xD;
though one be but half an Indian."&#xD;
"Well ?" said Mariot, impatiently.&#xD;
"A party of one hundred young warriors are&#xD;
already on the alert, and it will be strange indeed&#xD;
if-"&#xD;
The remainder of the sentence was spoken in&#xD;
a tone so low that Brion could not hear it ; he&#xD;
crept nearer.&#xD;
"Be sure that you make no mistake, for my&#xD;
own party are encamped in a valley not far&#xD;
below us."&#xD;
" Diable, that is bad, for all is fish that comes&#xD;
to their net-the Blackfeet I mean. If they&#xD;
should strike their trail, I could not restrain&#xD;
them. 1 have seen Ravenelaw, a chief of great&#xD;
consequence ; but he dislikes me, and is too&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
proud to be advised or led by one with white&#xD;
blood in his veins. I spoke of Redpath ; but&#xD;
my curiosity provoked him; he frowned and&#xD;
looked dangerous, and in a terrible voice told&#xD;
me to begone, and put a bridle on my tongue;&#xD;
since that I have not dared to speak the name of&#xD;
Redpath."&#xD;
" Nor is there need ; he is already upon the&#xD;
trail, doing his fearful work. Three have been&#xD;
stricken and more will follow. Discontent is in&#xD;
the camp-the expedition will fail."&#xD;
"Ah !" said Brion.&#xD;
"Did you hear anything?" asked Beavertaker.&#xD;
Mariot said no.&#xD;
"Diable ! can this be true, Monsieur Mariot ?"&#xD;
" Can what be true ?"&#xD;
" That Redpath is on the 'trail of Brion's&#xD;
brigade."&#xD;
" Mon Dieu, it is a fact ! He kills with a&#xD;
steel arrow which pierces the brain. It is ter-&#xD;
rible, but does my work-it cripples the power&#xD;
of that accursed company that threatens to ruin&#xD;
the house of Bellmar and Mariot."&#xD;
" You run some risk yourself," said Beaver-&#xD;
taker.&#xD;
" I know it, therefore my stay with the band&#xD;
will be short. I have already sprung my mine&#xD;
on the discontented ones. I have worked on&#xD;
their fears and their cupidity. I shall take away&#xD;
at least a dozen of his men, which will be a se-&#xD;
vere blow. Meantime, have your warriors con-&#xD;
cealed in the canon which you named wgen I&#xD;
saw you before, and-"&#xD;
"I understand," said the half-breed.&#xD;
" They have some good horses-a fact which&#xD;
it would be well to let your red devils know."&#xD;
" They shall be stolen," replied Beavertaker.&#xD;
"They may, perchance, cacltq some of their&#xD;
goods ?"&#xD;
" We will open the cache."&#xD;
"They, possibly, may wish to fight ?"&#xD;
"We will fight them, monsieur."&#xD;
Foudre I that is as it should be. Now I&#xD;
I must see my band of trappers and hunters."&#xD;
"Did you come with them?" -&#xD;
"No, with a small company of United States&#xD;
soldiers, who were sent to Fort Laramie, I found&#xD;
Kincaid, whobore me company till this morn-&#xD;
ing, or, rather till yesterday morning, as it is&#xD;
now past midnight--and by whose means I have&#xD;
held communication with the captain of my&#xD;
band. I shall meet Kincaid at the Red Butles,&#xD;
where he is at this moment, probably, awaiting&#xD;
me with two horses."&#xD;

&#xD;
After farther conversation, Pierre Mariot lef&#xD;
the canon, followed by Brion, who felt too much&#xD;
interest in his movements to dismiss him from&#xD;
farther espionage. Kincaid was with the horse&#xD;
at the specified place, and the wo thy pair rod&#xD;
away, together. Fortunately for 'e partisan&#xD;
the ground was of such a nature that they could&#xD;
not proceed very fast, so that he kept in sight&#xD;
of them without much exertion. They convers&#xD;
ed but little, and Brion could not hear what they&#xD;
said. They finally reached the valley near&#xD;
which Beavertaker found Ravenclaw, as related&#xD;
in another chapter. Entering it, the mountain-&#xD;
eer saw the fires of an encampment. The camp&#xD;
was large, extending some rods along the valley,&#xD;
numbering, he judged, by a casual survey, one&#xD;
hundred persons, or even more.&#xD;
The horses and pack-mules of the party were&#xD;
side-lined and quietly feeding within eighty yards&#xD;
of the band; and it was there that Mariot stop-&#xD;
ped, sending forth Kincaid to request Captain&#xD;
Callard, the leader, to come to him. While&#xD;
Pierre was waiting, Brion placed himself in a&#xD;
position to hear to the best advantage, with the&#xD;
least danger of discovery. The rival partisan&#xD;
came, when the same matters were talked of that&#xD;
had been discussed by the half-breed. ' Those&#xD;
topics having been duly considered, Callard&#xD;
broached another, which had the merit of nov-&#xD;
elty, and interested Brion equally as much.&#xD;
" There is one circumstance to which I must&#xD;
call your attention," said Callard. "A youth&#xD;
joined us at Fort Leavenworth, whose conduct&#xD;
has been suspicious. Once, certainly, he has&#xD;
had communication with Captain Brion's band,&#xD;
and on several occasions has manifested a desire&#xD;
to visit the camp of our rivals ; but he has been&#xD;
so closely watched, that save in the instance I&#xD;
have named, I do not think he has been able to&#xD;
do much mischief, if such was his intention.'&#xD;
Brion did not say "Ah I" but he thought it,&#xD;
which answered his purpose.&#xD;
"An informer among your men may do in-&#xD;
calculable injury," said Mariot, earnestly.&#xD;
" This is not all, 1%onsieur Mariot; it is said&#xD;
by some in camp that this youth is a woman."&#xD;
"Diable 1" exclaimed Mariot.&#xD;
"Ah !" said Brion, in a whisper.&#xD;
"A woman ?" added Pierre.&#xD;
"A woman I" repeated Callard.&#xD;
4' What the devil could send a woman among&#xD;
you ?"'asked Mariot, angrily.&#xD;
" It may have been love of adventure ; it&#xD;
{may have been simply love."&#xD;
&#xD;
t   "A woman ! love !  Callard, this is getting&#xD;
romantic."&#xD;
" Remember, that it is first to be known that&#xD;
s the youth is a woman, and then whether she is&#xD;
e in love, before we can judge if things are grow-&#xD;
ing romantic."&#xD;
"By what name is this 'youth called ?"&#xD;
" Crevier."&#xD;
" What is his deportment, generally ?"&#xD;
" He is. singularly reserved-holds himself&#xD;
aloof from the men, loves solitude, and his sole&#xD;
companion is a colored man who attends him&#xD;
like his shadow, treating him with very great&#xD;
deference."&#xD;
" The colored man is his servant, and appear-&#xD;
ed with him in the first instance ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
" What was his ostensible object in attaching&#xD;
himself to your party ?"&#xD;
" To join his father, he said, who has a trad-&#xD;
ing house on the Yellow Stone. Fearful that&#xD;
he might be a spy in the service of the American&#xD;
Fur Company, I have kept a constant watch-on&#xD;
his movements."&#xD;
"I must see this Crevier; do me the favor to&#xD;
ask him to come here."&#xD;
Crevier soon appeared, followed by a stout&#xD;
African. Brion recognized his youthful visitor,&#xD;
and regretted more than ever his unfriendly&#xD;
suspicions at the time of their first meeting. He&#xD;
looked upon his comely face and slender figure&#xD;
with new interest, doubting not but a woman's&#xD;
heart was beating beneath that masculine garb.&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES ARE MADE.&#xD;
PIERRE MARIOT had dismounted and was&#xD;
standing with his right arm on the saddle, his&#xD;
face partially concealed from the eyes of the ap-&#xD;
proaching youth by the horse's head. Crevier&#xD;
advanced hesitatingly, the negro pressing closer-&#xD;
to him as he drew near. The partisan was ner-&#xD;
vously anxious to obtain a fair view of his fea-&#xD;
tures-a fact showing an important change in&#xD;
his feelings since the night Crevier sat by his&#xD;
lonely fire.-&#xD;
" It is indeed a woman," he said mentally.&#xD;
Mariot was no less anxious to see the youth,&#xD;
and mark his bearing.&#xD;
" Well, sir," said Pierre, abruptly, "I have&#xD;
sent for you to ask a few questions concerning&#xD;
your father's trading-house on the Yellow Stone&#xD;
River."&#xD;
&#xD;
Crevier recoiled at the sound of Mariot's voice,&#xD;
and was much agitated. - The negro whispered&#xD;
to him, which in some degree restored his self-&#xD;
possession.&#xD;
The partisan noticed that Mariot evinced&#xD;
surprise, which betrayed itself in his tones.&#xD;
"Why do you wish to question me ?" asked&#xD;
Crevier, with some trepidation.&#xD;
."For the object I have stated."&#xD;
" What if I refuse to answer them ?" Crevier&#xD;
resumed.&#xD;
"I shall be obliged to compel you, possibly."&#xD;
"'Member dis chile am here !" said the Afri-&#xD;
can to Crevier, looking menacingly at Mariot.&#xD;
"Let that nigger be silent !" added Mariot,&#xD;
sternly.&#xD;
"He has a right to speak, I think ; he is not&#xD;
in your employ, and therefore not responsible to&#xD;
you, but to myself alone," continued Crevier,&#xD;
with spirit.&#xD;
"Dat am 'zactly it !" quoth Bhlaam, whose&#xD;
name had the merit of being scriptural.&#xD;
" Captain Callard, will you rap that nigger&#xD;
over the head," said Mariot.&#xD;
Captain Callard manifested a disposition to&#xD;
rap Balaam  over the head, but that nigger&#xD;
doubled a very large fist and, held it so Callard&#xD;
could see it, which had the desired effect to re-&#xD;
strain his enthusiasm.&#xD;
"Do you know, sir," Mariot continued, ad-&#xD;
dressing Crevier, " that I'm disposed to con-&#xD;
sider you a spy in the employ of the American&#xD;
Fur Company ?"&#xD;
" You are at liberty to think so," was the&#xD;
quiet rejoinder.&#xD;
"Captain Callard, it will be necessary that&#xD;
this young man by severely punished, as an ex-&#xD;
ample to others."-&#xD;
" That is my opinion, Monsieur Mariot."&#xD;
The partisan was observing Mariot as well as&#xD;
his position would allow, and plainly perceived&#xD;
that he was endeavoring to terrify Crevier and&#xD;
throw him off his guard ; but if that was his in-&#xD;
tention, he failed-the youth remained un-&#xD;
daunted.,&#xD;
" How are, spies usually punished, captain ?"&#xD;
" 0 with death, monsieui-; always." .&#xD;
" That was my impression.   What is this&#xD;
black man's name?"&#xD;
"Balaam," said Callard.&#xD;
" Well, Balaam will have to suffer with his&#xD;
master.&#xD;
In answer to this consoling information, Ba-&#xD;
laam looked at the moon and winked assiduously.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Leave me a few moments with this young&#xD;
man, captain, and take the nigger with you."&#xD;
" Come, Balaam," said Callard.&#xD;
"I stays with massa, allers," replied Balaam,&#xD;
firmly.&#xD;
"But I wish you to go," said Mariot.&#xD;
"An'. I wish" to stay where I is," returned&#xD;
Balaam, pertinaciously.&#xD;
The captain approached him with the inten-&#xD;
tion of laying his right hand upon his shoulder&#xD;
to lead him awayr; but Balaam assumed such a&#xD;
belligerent attitude that he deemed it prudent to&#xD;
forego his purpose and walk off without him.&#xD;
"This is all very strange," said Mariot, when&#xD;
the captain was out of hearing.&#xD;
"What do you refer to ?" asked Crevier, in&#xD;
a faltering voice.&#xD;
"It is useless to wear the mask longer, Mad-&#xD;
emoiselle Mignon."~&#xD;
"My secret is - discovered ; alas !" cried the&#xD;
youth.&#xD;
"0, it required but a glance to penetrate your&#xD;
disguise. He that loves, has sharp eyes," Ma-&#xD;
riot rejoined, with something of triumph in his&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
" Let me entreat that you will not beti4y me,&#xD;
Monsieur Mariot ?" said Mignon, in supplicat-&#xD;
ing tones.&#xD;
"Ah, Mignon, had it been for my sake, I&#xD;
should be the happiest of men ; but I dare not&#xD;
flatter myself that such is the case ?" said Pierre,&#xD;
softly.&#xD;
" For his sake 1" muttered Brion.&#xD;
"Do not flatter yourself too much, monsieur."&#xD;
"Then you had another object in-view ?"&#xD;
"Your vanity is without parallel !"&#xD;
"You persist in averring that you have not&#xD;
regretted-that is, that you have' not changed&#xD;
your mind in regard-?'&#xD;
" To your proposal !"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"I should hate myself "if I had no nobler ob-&#xD;
ject in view, Monsieur Pierre 1"&#xD;
"And very properly, too,"- quoth Brion to&#xD;
himself, whose heart was beating violently.&#xD;
"Diable ! you are the same. I had hoped-"&#xD;
" That I had repented."&#xD;
" Precisely."&#xD;
"But you see I have not ?".&#xD;
" Do you know, Mademoiselle Bellmar, that&#xD;
this frankness may injure you ?"&#xD;
"Explain."&#xD;
"Do you not perceive that you are in my&#xD;
power?"&#xD;

&#xD;
" 0, you are there !"&#xD;
" Yes, I command here. I sued at Westport."&#xD;
"I forgot for the instant that I was talking to&#xD;
a villain," replied Mignon, with dignity.&#xD;
"Excellent !" quoth the partisan. " She has&#xD;
him there I"&#xD;
"Mignon, reflect upon your situation. I have&#xD;
power to protect you-to keep your secret, to&#xD;
preserve you from ridicule."&#xD;
"And if you were a gentleman, you would do&#xD;
so unconditionally."&#xD;
"That your conduct has been bold and un-&#xD;
maidenly, I think you must own; with such a&#xD;
precedent before me, I may venture to be bold&#xD;
and unmanly. What have you to answer to&#xD;
such logic ?"&#xD;
" Humanly you are ; but if by boldness you&#xD;
mean physical courage, I should say you will&#xD;
never be bold."&#xD;
"Be sarcastic, if you will; yet it seems to&#xD;
me that we meet under circumstances in which&#xD;
you would do well to abate your pride and hold&#xD;
humbler language. You are at present so sit-&#xD;
uated, as to be under my authority."&#xD;
" I do not acknowledge your authority. You&#xD;
cannotwithout an unwarrantable usurpation of&#xD;
power restrain my actions, or control my move-&#xD;
ments."                     -&#xD;
" Your personal comfort shall be attended to&#xD;
as far as my means will allow, and you shall be&#xD;
treated with respect by my men; but you must&#xD;
know that you are not at liberty to leave the&#xD;
party."&#xD;
" Dare you thus presume to take from me my&#xD;
freedom ? By what right, Monsieur Mariot, do&#xD;
you thus assume authority over me ?"&#xD;
" By the right of might."&#xD;
"That is well answered; but hear my pro-&#xD;
test. I will not submit to your tyranny. There&#xD;
must be men of honor in your party. I will&#xD;
throw myself upon their generosity ; they will&#xD;
protect me."&#xD;
"These men are in my pay."&#xD;
"And my father's, too; you forget that you&#xD;
are the junior partner!"&#xD;
"I remember everything that I wish to re-&#xD;
member, Mademoiselle Bellmar."&#xD;
"A rare faculty."&#xD;
"In the name ofall that is wild and marvel-&#xD;
lous, tell me your motive for unsexing yourself,&#xD;
and running such a quixotic career ?"&#xD;
" That is a'secret in my own keeping, fortu-&#xD;
nately."&#xD;
" Your motive must have been extraordinary.&#xD;
&#xD;
Your father will lose his reason when he hears&#xD;
of this ?"&#xD;
" God avert such a calamity !" exclaimed Mig-&#xD;
non, with fervor.&#xD;
"You do well to invoke the name of God&#xD;
after committing this fatal error ! You should&#xD;
have reflected and deported yourself as becomes&#xD;
one of your sex and age. But this mountain&#xD;
pilgrimage, I'll wager my reputation, is all for&#xD;
love !"&#xD;
"Don't wager your reputation, Monsieur&#xD;
Pierre-the stake is too great !"-&#xD;
"You sustain your part bravely, I'll admit;&#xD;
but be assured I'll probe your secret to the bot-&#xD;
tom. Ah, Mignon, the time will come when you&#xD;
shall redden with shame at the sound of my&#xD;
voice, it shall so remind you of your folly.".&#xD;
" It reminds me of everything absurd at this&#xD;
moment."&#xD;
Balaam rubbed his hands and laughed. Ma-&#xD;
riot bit his lip with vexation, and called Callard,&#xD;
who was waiting his pleasure, at the nearest fire.&#xD;
He came, and with him two persons-Grenier&#xD;
and Kincaid.&#xD;
"Men," said Mariot, "you are to watch this'&#xD;
youth, this Monsieur Crevier, and his servant,&#xD;
and see that- they do not leave the party. I&#xD;
have special reasons for wishing them to remain&#xD;
with us."&#xD;
Callard bowed and smiled.&#xD;
" Captain," said Mignon, gently, "I hope we&#xD;
shall be friends ?"&#xD;
" I-I trust so," responded Callard, consider-&#xD;
ably embarrassed.&#xD;
" Here is my hand,. captain," she added, ex-&#xD;
tejiding that little member with charming grace&#xD;
to the leader, who could not refuse the tempting&#xD;
offer; while Pierre beheld the demonstration&#xD;
with ill-concealed anger and jealousy.&#xD;
"And yet, mad-Mr. Crevier, I mean-I ex-&#xD;
pect I shall be obliged to restrict you to certain&#xD;
limits ; but my authority shall be mildly exert-&#xD;
ed, believe me."&#xD;
" Beware, captain," said Pierre, with a forced&#xD;
smile. "You're upon dangerous ground."&#xD;
Mariot had advanced a little, and now stood&#xD;
two paces in front of his horse, with the bridle&#xD;
upon his arm. Callard, Kincaid and Grenier&#xD;
were at his right, at the distance of three or four&#xD;
yards, while Mignon and Balaam were on the&#xD;
left. Brion occupied a position to see the par-&#xD;
ties very well. What had just passed between&#xD;
the captain and Mignon did not escape his no-&#xD;
tice, but gave a painful sensation which was&#xD;
&#xD;
REDPATH&#xD;
&#xD;
new to him. Possibly it was for Callard that&#xD;
she left a happy home to tempt the dangers and&#xD;
hardships of the mountain. Although theidea&#xD;
was unpleasant~ for a moment, he really envied&#xD;
the captain.&#xD;
"Fortunate man," he murmured. "Fortu-&#xD;
nate man ; you have pressed that little hand."&#xD;
The partisan's brow was clouded; sorrow and&#xD;
indignation were contending within. At one&#xD;
moment his limbs seemed losing their strength ;&#xD;
at another he appeared to be suffocating with&#xD;
some new malady that pressed his heart from&#xD;
his chest to his throat. He bent forward that&#xD;
not a word might escape him, so intensely inter-&#xD;
esting were the developments. Mariot turned&#xD;
to Grenier and said :&#xD;
" I suppose you are ready to render an ac-&#xD;
count of what you have done ?"&#xD;
Grenier was about to reply, when some object&#xD;
whistled through the air. Grenier threw up his&#xD;
arms, rolled his eyes wildly, and fell upon his&#xD;
face. There were simultaneous cries of aston-&#xD;
ishment. The long, smoothly-wrought shaft of&#xD;
an arrow protruded from Grenicr's head.&#xD;
Mariot proceeded from the spot 'in absolute&#xD;
terror, as if expecting to feel the point of the&#xD;
steel bolt in his own brain.      -&#xD;
" Mon Dieu !" he cried, with a shudder.&#xD;
"Pierre Mariot," exclaimed Mignon, pointing&#xD;
-at Grenier, "read your destiny ; behold how&#xD;
Heaven will punish your evil deeds !"&#xD;
"Doomed !" muttered Kincaid, despairingly,&#xD;
dropping his chin upon his breast, while Callard,&#xD;
with more presence of mind, sprang into the ad-&#xD;
joining thicket, rifle in hand.&#xD;
" Come back," shouted Mariot; but Callard&#xD;
was already in the -bushes. It was fortunate&#xD;
for Brion that the captain turned to the northern&#xD;
instead of the western side, for it was frotn that&#xD;
quarter that the arrow had apparently been pro-&#xD;
jected. After beating about in the thicket a few&#xD;
minutes, Callard returned, having seen no enemy.&#xD;
" Look at your misguided instrument, and&#xD;
tell me if you are prepared to go as suddenly ?"&#xD;
said Mignon to Pierre, warningly.&#xD;
"Instrument !" repeated IMariot, with  a&#xD;
quickness that proved she had touched a sensi-&#xD;
tive spot. " You know too much, Mignon!"&#xD;
"Now would it not be singular, Monsieur&#xD;
Mariot, if you should meet the fate of the man&#xD;
at our feet," she resumed, impressively.&#xD;
Pierre looked at the dead man and breathed&#xD;
heavily ; an indefinable awe was tugging at his&#xD;
heart-a phantom hand menaced him.&#xD;
&#xD;
41&#xD;
&#xD;
Callard attempted to draw the ' arrow from&#xD;
Grenier's head; but it broke close to the skull,&#xD;
the steel point remaining firmly embedded in the&#xD;
brain.&#xD;
Mignon and Balaam walked toward the en-&#xD;
campment ; Mariot followed in three minutes-&#xD;
the camp was astir, hunters and trappers run-&#xD;
ning to the place where Grenier had fallen.&#xD;
The partisan hurried away from the locality&#xD;
much excited by what he had seen and heard.&#xD;
Indeed, it was to him a night of startling reve-&#xD;
lations; but being of 4 strong, well-balanced&#xD;
mind, he regained his wonted calmness-to ap-&#xD;
pearance-before he reached the encampment of&#xD;
his band.&#xD;
Buckeye met him outside the corral, where he&#xD;
had been impatiently awaiting him.&#xD;
"By the beard of Joe Smith!" he exclaimed,&#xD;
"I've a nice bone for you to pick,iand have been&#xD;
waitin' to throw it to you for more than three&#xD;
hours."&#xD;
" Well, give it a toss-I will catch it," quoth&#xD;
Brion.&#xD;
"You'll growl over it, I'll warrant."&#xD;
" I promise not to bite."&#xD;
" Well, here it is; there's mutiny in the camp&#xD;
-the trappin' business is at a discount, and gold&#xD;
huntin' in the Aztec kentry is at a premium."&#xD;
"Ah !"&#xD;
"Jes' so, cap'n, I reckon."&#xD;
" Who is at the head of the new enterprise ?"&#xD;
"Headley, of course ; but that new feller, the&#xD;
Frenchman, sprung the trap on,'em."&#xD;
" Why, Headley apologized for his conduct ?"&#xD;
"Perhaps he will agin; comes kind of nat'ral&#xD;
to him, don't it ?"&#xD;
"I, too, have made discoveries, Buckeye."&#xD;
" Open your pack."&#xD;
" If I possess any considerable tact in reading&#xD;
human character, you are an honest man. May&#xD;
I reckon upon your friendship and assistance ?"&#xD;
" By the beard of Joe Smith, yes ! When I&#xD;
forgit to treat jou like a friend and brother, may&#xD;
the arrow of Redpath pierce my brain !"&#xD;
" You are sincere, and I will make you the&#xD;
repository of important matters. It will be a&#xD;
relief to share the secrets of the night with one&#xD;
whom I am sure will not betray me."&#xD;
The partisan then narrated the incidents al-&#xD;
ready placed before the reader, reserving to him-&#xD;
self the privilege of representing Mignon in a&#xD;
way as favorable to her as the case would pos-&#xD;
sibly admit. Of his passion' for her he said&#xD;
nothing ; indeed, he was not willing to acknowl-&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
edge the existence of such a sentiment, even to&#xD;
himself; and the pains he took to conceal it&#xD;
served to awaken suspicions in the mind of the&#xD;
trapper, and point to the truth.&#xD;
"A reg'lar conspiracy ; very curious consarn ;&#xD;
lucky thing that you watched Monsieur Mariot.&#xD;
I concluded there was sumthin' wicked in him&#xD;
while I lay liseenin' among the packs and sad-&#xD;
dles to his grand talk about gold diskiveries, and&#xD;
the castle of Montezuma, which is a humbug.&#xD;
The villain has used a good deal of nat'ral cnn-&#xD;
nin' in layin' his plans, but the tables may be&#xD;
turned on him; notwithstandin'. The heathen&#xD;
riptile with the bow is arter him, anid he'll leave&#xD;
some of his men behind him, even as you have.&#xD;
The divil takes care of his own, it is said ; -if it&#xD;
wasn't so, we might expect to hear some day&#xD;
that Monsieur Mariot had felt the sharp p'int of&#xD;
the steel arrow."&#xD;
"He will return before morning, hoping his&#xD;
absence has not been noticed," said Brion, very&#xD;
earnestly.&#xD;
" He will come back to conduct Headley and-&#xD;
his friends to the Casa Montezuma, and the&#xD;
land of treasure. How shall you receive him,&#xD;
cap'n"?"&#xD;
"I have not matured my plan, yet. Indeed,&#xD;
I am much disturbed and confused by the extra-&#xD;
ordinary things that have-providentially, let&#xD;
me believe-fallen under my observation.  I&#xD;
need time to reflect-to resolve on a course of&#xD;
conduct that shall be the most judicious, the best&#xD;
for my employers, my men, and lastly myself;&#xD;
for self, friend Buckeye, in an affair like this,&#xD;
ought to come last, and not be made to occupy&#xD;
the first place in my thoughts. Danger encir-&#xD;
cles me like a belt ; but men have been in more&#xD;
precarious positions, and lived to tell the story&#xD;
of their escape ; thus may it be with me. There&#xD;
are some veterans in my party that I can rely&#xD;
on; they will not fail me, I trust, in an emer-&#xD;
gency. We can deal with the Blackfeet war-&#xD;
riors. A surprise would be disastrous, extreme-&#xD;
ly ; but that peril is now comparatively small.&#xD;
To know an enemy's order of battle is to know&#xD;
how to meet him. With your aid, it will be&#xD;
difficult for a war party of an hundred to ap-&#xD;
.proach our camp without discovery. I count&#xD;
you a dozen ordinary men; because you have&#xD;
much experience in Indian policy, and know&#xD;
how to look through the double sights."&#xD;
" That's a compliment I'm proud of, insomuch&#xD;
as it wasn't said by a common man by way of&#xD;
flattery. Cap'n, I am at your orders from this&#xD;
&#xD;
minute ; tell me to do this or that, to'reconnoi-&#xD;
tre, to follow trail, to watch fob an enemy by&#xD;
night, to fight till the last gasp, and I'll do it&#xD;
without questions. It's an offer I never made&#xD;
afore, but by the beard of Joe Snmith, there's&#xD;
sumthin' in ye I like."&#xD;
The partisan smiled pleasantly and held out&#xD;
his hand. buckeye gave it a rough and hearty&#xD;
grasp, thus sealing the friendly compact which&#xD;
was to last as long as the lives of the parties.&#xD;
It is now time that we return to 1)Iignon, and&#xD;
take a casual glance at the passage of events&#xD;
somewhat in their regular order. Mariot speed-&#xD;
ily made Bellmar acquainted with the fact that&#xD;
Mademoiselle had repudiated the long talked-of&#xD;
alliance. That gentleman received the informa-&#xD;
tion with more calmness than he had anticipated.&#xD;
He told Pierre to be patient ; he would see his&#xD;
daughter ; he trusted the matter would be satis-&#xD;
factorily arranged ; there was no need of ex-&#xD;
citement; he had skill to manage it properly.&#xD;
Mariot was led to hope in the ultimate surren-&#xD;
der of the fair citadel; we will learn how he&#xD;
prospered.&#xD;
Monsieur Bellmar at length broached the sub-&#xD;
ject gently to Mignon, who demanded to know&#xD;
why he was desirous of such a union. He're-&#xD;
plied that he was anxious for such a consumma-&#xD;
tion for several reasons.&#xD;
"Is Monsieur Mariot a man of honor ?" she&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
Bellmar was confused.&#xD;
"As much so, perhaps, as the average of man-&#xD;
kind," he answered.&#xD;
"Is he possessed of even common honesty ?"&#xD;
resumed Mignon, taking her father's hand.&#xD;
"What a strange question, Mignon," he re-&#xD;
turned, evasively.&#xD;
"Do you consult my happiness, only, in this&#xD;
alliance ?" she demanded.&#xD;
" What else should I consult ?"&#xD;
" Interest-worldly interest, possibly."&#xD;
" Such a marriage would be advantageous in&#xD;
a pecuniary point of view, I admit."&#xD;
" Do you fear his anger in case of my refu-&#xD;
sal ?"&#xD;
"Pierre, you remember, inherited his father's&#xD;
property, which was worth at his decease far&#xD;
more than mine; Pierre wished to enlarge our&#xD;
business when he. succeeded his father in the&#xD;
house, and having considerable money, the say-&#xD;
ings of my late partner, he made an investment&#xD;
of capital beyond my means, so that, in truth, I&#xD;
&#xD;
am his debtor to a large amount, which might&#xD;
make it exceedingly awkward, should he wish&#xD;
for a dissolution of the house of Bellmar &amp;amp;&#xD;
Mariot."&#xD;
"But all your resources are. not invested ;&#xD;
during the many years of your labors, you must&#xD;
have amassed enough to ensure you a com-&#xD;
petence ?"&#xD;
"I have laid by something for you, my child,&#xD;
which you shall have."&#xD;
"Well, then, my father, let us be content.&#xD;
Pierre is a villain, 4and I will not consent to be&#xD;
united to a bad man. Whenever you are clos-&#xD;
eted with him you should pray, 'Lead me not&#xD;
into temptation, but deliver me from all evil."'&#xD;
"One would think you had been listening !"&#xD;
he exclaimed, with displeasure.     1 *1&#xD;
"And correctly, too ; for I happened to be in&#xD;
the room adjoining the library at the time of your&#xD;
interview with Pierre in regard to the Ameri-&#xD;
can Fur Company."&#xD;
"And-you heard all !" criedBellmar, excited.&#xD;
"All, my father. And I heard also, what&#xD;
you did not-the development of his scheme."&#xD;
" The following day with three men&#xD;
"Yes. Can you now say-to me, 'My daugh-&#xD;
ter, I wish you to marry Monsieur Mariot,,for&#xD;
he is a worthy man?'&#xD;
Bellmar pressed his hands to his forehead&#xD;
and made no answer.&#xD;
Mignon related circumstantially all that had&#xD;
transpired at the interview between Mariot, Gre-&#xD;
nier, Kincaid and Gardette, to which her audi-&#xD;
tor listened without once looking at her, or&#xD;
changing his attitude.&#xD;
" Is all this villany to transpire without one&#xD;
effort to prevent it ?" Mignon asked, with in-&#xD;
genuous warmth, when    the narration was&#xD;
completed.&#xD;
" What can be done ? Mariot will act as he&#xD;
pleases," said Bellmar.'&#xD;
"What, will you suffer yourself to be com-&#xD;
promised in character by the machinations of a&#xD;
bad man ! Do you not see that his evil schem-&#xD;
ing must sooner or later become known ? Too&#xD;
many persons have his secrets in possession,&#xD;
each of whom would betray him for a few dol-&#xD;
lars. Are you then to connive at murder, my&#xD;
dear father? Are you to be the. accomplice of&#xD;
assassins?"&#xD;
Mignon spoke earnestly, and Bellmar began&#xD;
to be startled by her representations.&#xD;
"Indeed, you move me, Mignon. I had not&#xD;
considered the subject in a light so serious."'&#xD;
&#xD;
"Your hairs, my father, are already silvery ;&#xD;
would you add crime to age, and die with the&#xD;
dark mark of Cain upon your brow ? Act while&#xD;
there is time, I entreat of you I"&#xD;
"I am powerless,.powerless! .Mariot has sent&#xD;
his emissaries ; they are far upon their way. I&#xD;
cannot overtake them, if I wbuld ; for you know.&#xD;
Mignon, that the fire and energy of youth de-&#xD;
parted years ago. I regret what he has done,&#xD;
extremely; his plans are both rash and wicked,&#xD;
Mon Dieu, my child, I am troubled."&#xD;
"Now you speak according to the dictates of.&#xD;
nature and religion, and your voice.is pleasant.&#xD;
Ah, if you listen to Pierre, you will leave me but&#xD;
a legacy of infamy !"&#xD;
"But what can I do, girl ?"&#xD;
" Dissolve all connection with Mariot, even&#xD;
at a great- pecuniary sacrifice. Let him with-&#xD;
draw his capital-suffer him to do his worst-&#xD;
the law will protect you ; you will be a gainer to&#xD;
rid yourself of him at any price."&#xD;
"I believe that is the truth, Mignon. World-&#xD;
ly interests may have blinded my eyes, but do&#xD;
you think I am a very bad man at heart, my&#xD;
daughter ?"&#xD;
"0 no, at heart you are good ; therefore you&#xD;
should not be unequally yoked with an unbe-&#xD;
liever in human-virtue, a contemner of honesty,&#xD;
a scoffer at, religion, an apostate from honor.&#xD;
Say you will try to save Brion's party from&#xD;
destruction, and let the house of Bellmar &amp;amp;&#xD;
Mariot fall? How your gray hairs would look&#xD;
at the bar of justice; how your head would&#xD;
droop with shame under the heavy pressure of&#xD;
guilt !"&#xD;
"Perhaps Mariot will relent."&#xD;
" But you have said it is already too late ; he&#xD;
has sent hired assassins to dog the honest parti-&#xD;
san, to cut off men engaged in a lawful calling."&#xD;
" Parbleu ! woman's instincts are said to be&#xD;
quick and true ; come, what shall I do ?"&#xD;
"You will trust it to me ?"'&#xD;
" I will trust it to you."&#xD;
"And you will allow me money, and what-&#xD;
ever I may wish."&#xD;
"I will allow you money, and whatever you&#xD;
may wish."&#xD;
Mignon embraced her father, who went on to&#xD;
say that business would compel him to go to St.&#xD;
Louis, to be absent three weeks; but he trusted&#xD;
in her discretion, having no fears that she would&#xD;
be guilty of follies.&#xD;
" Your mind," he continued, "is fertile in ex-&#xD;
pedients, while mine, Mignon, has lost the great-&#xD;
&#xD;
e-ft&#xD;

&#xD;
er part of its strength and vigor. I am willing,&#xD;
I am more than willing,-I am anxious that&#xD;
Pierre's designs should be thwarted.'. But Brion&#xD;
has gone, .and I know not where he is to be&#xD;
found. 'Whetlher his men are at Fort Leaven-&#xD;
worth or on the way, I know not. We hoped&#xD;
our party would be in advance of him, but his&#xD;
activity has outdone us. If Brion is at Fort&#xD;
Leavenworth, a faithful messenger might be&#xD;
sent to warn him to be on his guard-without&#xD;
compromising myself or Mariot. A few vague&#xD;
hints judiciously thrown out would be sufficient,&#xD;
without calling names, or indicating the precise&#xD;
nature of the danger."&#xD;
"Was not Captain Brion here a week ago ?"&#xD;
"Yes, he was after men; but most of them&#xD;
being already engaged by me, he left the same&#xD;
day, and since that time has passed through all&#xD;
the frontier towns of any note, in search of hunt-&#xD;
ers and trappers. And this is why it is so dif-&#xD;
ficult to find him."&#xD;
" When will your band be ready to start ?"&#xD;
"In ten days."&#xD;
"Numbering how many men ?"&#xD;
"One hundred." ,&#xD;
"And commanded by-",&#xD;
" Captain Callard."&#xD;
The foregoing conversation led to that extra-&#xD;
ordinary resolution which resulted in the pil-&#xD;
grimage of Mignon, in male attire, to the west-&#xD;
ern wilds. She hoped to find the partisan at&#xD;
Fort Leavenworth, make such communication&#xD;
as she might without directing suspicion toward&#xD;
-her father, and return without a protracted ab-&#xD;
sence. She waited her father's departure with&#xD;
impatience, that she might put her plan into ex-&#xD;
ecution, but he delayed it day after day. Ten&#xD;
days elapsed before he set out for St. Louis,&#xD;
and even then Callard had not secured his com-&#xD;
plement of men.&#xD;
Mignon abandoned the expectation of finding&#xD;
Brion at Fort Leavenworth, so much time had&#xD;
passed since he left Westport-therefore deter-&#xD;
mined upon that course of conduct which finally&#xD;
introduced her to the reader on the prairies.&#xD;
Having once formed the project, she set about&#xD;
preliminary operations with an earnestness that&#xD;
conquered obstacles, and a foresight that would&#xD;
not have been discreditable to a veteran trapper.&#xD;
Her perspicacity owed much of its acuteness,&#xD;
however, to observation, derived from the asso-&#xD;
ciations which her father's business naturally&#xD;
threw around her. From her earliest recollec-&#xD;
tions she had seen hunters and trappers, heard&#xD;
&#xD;
their tales of adventure ; they were a class whose&#xD;
habits and peculiarities were most familiar. She&#xD;
knew the nature of the perils that attended them&#xD;
in their long excursions, amid the rugged and&#xD;
snowy mountains, what kind of an outfit they&#xD;
needed, their mode of travelling and defence,&#xD;
and lastly how, when, and where they practised&#xD;
their trade.&#xD;
Balaam was a faithful servant, who had been&#xD;
many years in the family. It was the particular&#xD;
wish of Madame Bellma', at the time of her de-&#xD;
cease, which was when Mignon was but a child,&#xD;
that Balaam should always be considered a mein-&#xD;
ber of the household and be treated with kind-&#xD;
ness, which desire had been strictly observed and&#xD;
respected. Balaam was not, as the reader may&#xD;
be inclined to conjecture, feeble and in his do-&#xD;
tage, but robust, and a giant in strength. At-&#xD;
fifty years, with power undiminished by hard-&#xD;
ship and abuse, he was at the best period of his&#xD;
manhood. Mignon found in him an able coad-&#xD;
jutor-after she had overcome his scruples, and&#xD;
silenced his objections-for Balaam had twice&#xD;
been to Bellmar's trading-house in the country&#xD;
of the Nez Perces.&#xD;
When her preparations were completed, she&#xD;
proceeded to Fort Leavenworth, accompanied&#xD;
by this faithful friend and servant. Brion had&#xD;
departed.&#xD;
The description of the slender youth, in the&#xD;
opening chapter, precludes the necessity of de-&#xD;
scribing Mignon's appearance when she joined&#xD;
the trappers at Fort Leavenworth. Previous to&#xD;
starting, she wrote an affectionate letter for her&#xD;
father-who two days before had left for St.&#xD;
Louis, placing it where he would be sure to find&#xD;
it. The advent of Mignon among the hunters&#xD;
was looked upon by Callard with suspicion;&#xD;
she soon perceived that she was watched, and&#xD;
deprecated from her heart that selfish interest&#xD;
that fills the human soul with distrust.&#xD;
"Balaam," said Mignon, "is there not some-&#xD;
thing you wish to say to me ?"&#xD;
" Dar is, Massa Crevier," replied Balaam.&#xD;
" Well, there is no one in hearing ; proceed."&#xD;
" Does ye see dat fire ober dar ?"  -&#xD;
"Yes, Balaam."&#xD;
" Whose fire dat is, ye spect ?"&#xD;
"Mignon answered that she could form no&#xD;
supposition, whatever."&#xD;
Balaam informed her that Captain Brion&#xD;
was encamped there for the night.&#xD;
"Alone ?" inquired Mignon.&#xD;
&#xD;
,,&#xD;
&#xD;
Balaam replied in the affirmative, explaining&#xD;
that his party were in advance, he having left&#xD;
Fort Leavenworth but a few hours before Callard&#xD;
began his march.&#xD;
" I must speak to Captain Brion," added&#xD;
Mignon.&#xD;
"Dat am diffikilt," quoth Balaam,&#xD;
" Do you think we are watched ?"&#xD;
" Ebry minute, Missy Mignon ?"&#xD;
"Hush, call me Master Crevier. I will put&#xD;
the matter to the test. I will walk leisurely'&#xD;
from the camp, and you will remain here. If&#xD;
I need you, I 'will discharge my rifle, the use of&#xD;
which you have so well taught me. If I am fol-&#xD;
lowed, you will be sure to observe the circum-&#xD;
stance."&#xD;
The fire to which Balaam had cited Mignon's&#xD;
attention, was distant nearly half a mile, but on&#xD;
account of an intervening valley did not seem&#xD;
half so far.&#xD;
She left the encampment, advancing with&#xD;
mingled emotions oftimidity and heroism. - How&#xD;
novel was her situation! What unfriendly con-&#xD;
structions her conduct might bear ! But she&#xD;
arose superior to weakness ; she felt a strength&#xD;
that surprised herself, and prayed that those&#xD;
might be forgiven whose unhappy temperament&#xD;
it is to think evil of others. She would save her&#xD;
aged father from becoming partaker of another's&#xD;
sins, from sharing another's crime. That was&#xD;
just-that was praiseworthy-that was right-&#xD;
and all the. sophistry in the world could not&#xD;
make right wrong. She grew strong in moral&#xD;
power,'a shield of protection was over, above,&#xD;
around her. Her fears were dispelled by the&#xD;
strength of virtue, and the consciousness of&#xD;
truth.&#xD;
Mignon heard steps, and looking around; saw&#xD;
Captain Callard followingher. She paused upon&#xD;
a gentle eminence, the same where she first ap-&#xD;
peared to the reader. It has been shown how&#xD;
she reached the bivouac of Brion, meeting with&#xD;
a reception from that worthy man,.which, though&#xD;
civil, was not cordial.&#xD;
Mignon's calmness was severely shaken by'&#xD;
the trapper's coldness, which caused her to re-&#xD;
alize but too sensibly the peculiar awkwardness&#xD;
of her position. To conceal her feelings, she as-&#xD;
sumed that thoughtful, abstracted air which we&#xD;
noted in the, proper place, such a mood giving&#xD;
her a natural pretext for averting her face from&#xD;
the mountaineer. She had flattered herself that&#xD;
she could meet Brion unshrinkingly, and warn&#xD;
him of the danger impending without effort or&#xD;
&#xD;
hesitation ; but now she found herself over-&#xD;
whelmed by innumerable scruples, and a diffi-&#xD;
dence quite unaccountable.&#xD;
She was observed, too ; Callard was behind a&#xD;
tree, not fifty yards distant ; he showed -himself&#xD;
to Mignon, with his right forefinger upon his&#xD;
lips, and his left held up in menace ; this pan-&#xD;
tomime signified that she should be silent. She&#xD;
was cruelly embarrassed; but a remarkable&#xD;
power of self-control kept her outwardly calm.&#xD;
She resolved not to be thwarted ; when she had&#xD;
sufficient command over her voice, she said,&#xD;
without changing her meditative attitude or&#xD;
expression :&#xD;
" captain Brion, there is danger near you;&#xD;
I have come to put you upon your guard ; but&#xD;
I am watched; a man behind yonder tree is,&#xD;
almost near enough to hear my voice."&#xD;
Mignon waited for a response ;'the mountain-&#xD;
eer was already asleep, while Captain Callard&#xD;
was drawing nearer. She arose to go, when to&#xD;
her horror, she discovered a serpent winding its&#xD;
unsightly body into a coil, three paces from the&#xD;
partisan's head. To seize a long fagot and dis-&#xD;
patch the loathsome creature, was the work of a&#xD;
moment only; she marvelled at her own promp-&#xD;
titude and boldness as soon as the deed was ac-&#xD;
complished. Excited and trembling she hurried&#xD;
from the spot to meet Balaam who was approach=&#xD;
ing. Eluding Callard, she returned to the en-&#xD;
campment, glad that her feeble hand had been&#xD;
the instrument of Providence in the preserva-&#xD;
tion of the trapper.&#xD;
It was after this partial failure that Mignon&#xD;
resolved on another experiment. As has been&#xD;
anticipated, it was through her agency that the&#xD;
hatchet had been left where it would fall into&#xD;
the hands of Brion, the. dumb bearer of a con-&#xD;
cealed message. Balaam had been trusted with&#xD;
that commission, and despite the espionage of&#xD;
Callard, succeeded in discharging it successfully&#xD;
by adroit management. Mignon had enjoined&#xD;
on him to be careful that a portion of the slip of&#xD;
paper be left visible, that it might immediately&#xD;
be seen by the finder ; an item which he so far&#xD;
overlooked, that, as we have seen, it was sev-&#xD;
eral days before it attracted the partisan's at-&#xD;
tention. To mystify the latter, Balaam had&#xD;
adopted the expedient of breaking the trail by&#xD;
grasping a mammoth vine that hung pendant&#xD;
from a tree, and swinging himself forward across&#xD;
a small gully where the ground was soft; this&#xD;
was why the trapper was baffled.&#xD;
By a skilful manoeuvre, Mignon evaded the&#xD;
&#xD;
REDPATH.&#xD;

&#xD;
vigilance of Callard, after the two bands had&#xD;
passed Fort Laramie, and joining the partisan,&#xD;
conversed with him in the manner related, not&#xD;
doubting but her warning had been read and&#xD;
understood; or, at least sufficiently compre-&#xD;
hended to make the captain so cautious as to&#xD;
frustrate the designs of his enemies. She wish-&#xD;
ed on that occasion to speak to him freely; but&#xD;
unfortunately, she  confounded Buckeye' with&#xD;
Gardette, the half breed, who was acting for&#xD;
Mariot ; and hence her silence on the subject&#xD;
ever uppermost in her thoughts.&#xD;
While she was planning an expedient to rid&#xD;
herself of his presence, Balaam appeared in the&#xD;
distance, motioning her to return to the party,&#xD;
inasmuch as her absence was exciting inquiry-&#xD;
a series of signals previously agreed upon. We&#xD;
are now ready to tell what happened to Mignon&#xD;
after her unexpected interview with Monsieur&#xD;
Mariot.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
MIGNON MEETS RAVENCLAW.&#xD;
MIGNON   loved liberty.  Nothing could be&#xD;
more repugnant to her feelings than the idea of&#xD;
personal restraint, especially when exercised by&#xD;
a man whose character she detested. To re-&#xD;
main with the band and be subject to the au-&#xD;
thority of Pierre Mariot, was a contingent&#xD;
entirely abhorrent to her notion of her own&#xD;
rights and privileges. It was also at variance&#xD;
with her instinctive delicacy to be brought again&#xD;
into contact with those who already knew or mis-&#xD;
trusted her sex ; who could neither understand&#xD;
her motives nor pity her confusion. To avoid be-&#xD;
ing so awkwardly and- painfully placed-an ob-&#xD;
ject, perchance, of rude comment and ridicule-&#xD;
to evade Mariot's vigilance and escape his dom-&#xD;
ination, became her ruling desire. In the- event&#xD;
of success, should she throw herself upon the&#xD;
protection of Brion, or attempt to return home&#xD;
across the wide prairies, attended by Balaam&#xD;
only ? The first was not without objections,&#xD;
but it appeared most safe and feasible. Mignon&#xD;
believed it would be best to act upon her deter-&#xD;
mination promptly, while Mariot was still labor-&#xD;
ing under surprise, before -he had artfully delib-&#xD;
erated, arranged his plan of action, and system-&#xD;
atized his espionage over her conduct.&#xD;
During her pilgrimage, Mignon had nightly&#xD;
been protected by a small tent, which Balaam&#xD;
had provided for that purpose, and which hef&#xD;
was expert in putting up and taking down.&#xD;
&#xD;
47&#xD;
&#xD;
REDPATH.&#xD;
&#xD;
The tent had two compartments, in the smaller&#xD;
of which slept Balaam, like a faithful watch-&#xD;
dog, ever on the alert, ready to start up for her&#xD;
defence at the first approach of danger. He kin-&#xD;
dled and kept the fires also, when fires were&#xD;
needful, cooking with skill, preparing the choic-&#xD;
est cuts of venison for his adventurous young&#xD;
mistress.&#xD;
So it will hence be seen that Mignon passed&#xD;
the time, when not on the march, quite by her-&#xD;
self, apart from that motley mixture of men&#xD;
composing Callard's band. The services of Ba-&#xD;
laam were many and important. His advice&#xD;
was always seasonable ; she trusted in his sa-&#xD;
gacity, anticipating protection from his strong&#xD;
arm in every emergency which might occur. He&#xD;
was proud of her confidence, willing to make&#xD;
any sacrifice that human creature could, to en-&#xD;
sure her safety and comfort. Balaam was well&#xD;
armed, and hardly it would fare with him who&#xD;
should have the temerity to insult Mignon. H&#xD;
was not wholly indebted to those deadly imple-&#xD;
ments in vogue, for the means of assault and&#xD;
vengeance, because nature had gifted him with&#xD;
hands of remarkable ,strength, with which to&#xD;
crush an - adversary, and administer corporeal&#xD;
pain. Balaam was of a patient, genial disposi-&#xD;
tion, but when a quarrel was forced upon him,&#xD;
and his feelings were outraged, he was an antag-&#xD;
onist greatly to be feared. Those so unfortunate&#xD;
as to feel the stunning power of his fist, repented'&#xD;
their rashness, and cared not to provoke his -ire&#xD;
again.&#xD;
Balaam was - consulted in reference- to the&#xD;
emergency that had arisen. She explained to&#xD;
him her reasons for not wishing to remain with&#xD;
the party, which, in his view, were sufficiently&#xD;
cogent ; indeed, her mere will would have been&#xD;
considered imperative, without a single argu-&#xD;
ment. She said to him:&#xD;
"We can escape more readily to night than&#xD;
to-morrow, or any subsequent period."&#xD;
"Dat am a fack," quoth Balaam.&#xD;
" Come, my friend," she continued, "how&#xD;
shall it  be done ?"&#xD;
" I want to know just where yer gwine when&#xD;
yer. git away; dat's de question dat 'quires&#xD;
splainin'."&#xD;
"Perhaps I shall throw myself upon the pro-&#xD;
tection of Captain Brion."&#xD;
"De man you-"&#xD;
" The man I-what, Balaam ?" said Mignon,&#xD;
sharply, coloring.&#xD;
"Nuffin of no consequence," replied Balaam.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Don't 'sturb me; I'm tinkin' how it can be&#xD;
done."&#xD;
" I'll wait patiently."t&#xD;
The African   remained  silent some five&#xD;
minutes.t&#xD;
"We shall want our bosses,"   he said, at&#xD;
length.&#xD;
Mignon assented.&#xD;
" Well dis chile must crawl. out dar 'mongst&#xD;
'em, cut de ' side-lines, and lead 'em off softly,&#xD;
while you creep away in nuther direction."&#xD;
" Yes, Balaam."&#xD;
"Den I jines ye wid de losses, ober dar by&#xD;
dem cotton-woods."&#xD;
" Suppose you should be discovered ?"&#xD;
" Dis cullod feller fight-git away. I'll meet&#xD;
ye dare, sure, 'twixt dis and mornin'-pervidin'&#xD;
you git dar."&#xD;
"That I can do, believe me. You see I am&#xD;
small-I can move quietly. Look out, and, ob-&#xD;
serve what is going on."&#xD;
Balaam did as bidden, reporting that most of&#xD;
the party were gathered around, the dead body&#xD;
of Grenier, but he could hear voices in Callard's&#xD;
tent.&#xD;
" The fate of that man was sudden and awful;&#xD;
but I imagined I saw in his death the hand of&#xD;
retributive justice," said Mignon.&#xD;
" Redpath am about," said the black, in an&#xD;
under tone.&#xD;
" Yes, it would really seem that there is such&#xD;
a personage; he was spoken of by that very man&#xD;
as a fitting terror to unloose upon Captain Bri-&#xD;
on's party, but his evil thought has reacted on&#xD;
him ; yonder he lies lifeless, translated in a mo-&#xD;
ment from this world to the other, with his sins&#xD;
upon him-with his many unrepented sins weigh-&#xD;
ing darkly upon him."&#xD;
Mignon paused, arrested   possibly by the&#xD;
thought that the same peril attended her, wher-&#xD;
ever she might wander in the mountains.&#xD;
" Did .you remark, Balaam, that the half-&#xD;
breed was much affectedby fear'? I recognized&#xD;
him immediately, as one of the three men in the&#xD;
service of Mariot-one of the trio from whose&#xD;
rudeness I was saved by the brave mountaineer.&#xD;
Not long since I confounded him with another,&#xD;
but who was a better man, undoubtedly."&#xD;
"Dere, missy, I'se forgot sev'ral 'portant 'tic'&#xD;
lars I" exclaimed Balaam, without heeding Mig-&#xD;
non's last remarks. " Here's our tent and bag-&#xD;
gage ; can't get 'long 'thout 'em."&#xD;
"I know they are useful, but necessity com-&#xD;
pels us to leave them."&#xD;
&#xD;
The black looked round and shook his head--&#xD;
equivalent to a declaration that he must have&#xD;
them at any risk. Mignon gave him to under-&#xD;
stand that she would confide the matter wholly&#xD;
to his discretion, having unshaken faith in his&#xD;
prudence.&#xD;
"And now," she resumed, "is it not time for&#xD;
me to go ?"&#xD;
Balaam-went out and reconnoitred once more,&#xD;
coming back very soon with the report that&#xD;
there was a fair prospect of success, as the at-&#xD;
tention of the band was still directed to the sub-&#xD;
ject of Grenier's death; while Mariot and Cal-&#xD;
lard were yet talking earnestly, as he learned,&#xD;
by listening in the vicinity of the parties.&#xD;
"I hate to have ye try it," said Balaam,&#xD;
"'cause it's dangerous-like, and dars no known'&#xD;
what'll happen; but if ye've made up yer mind&#xD;
to it, why I s'pose ye must. De Lord knows&#xD;
what'll come ob all dis, for I doesn't ; but I'll&#xD;
stick to ye long as I've de breff ob life. Now&#xD;
go and manage it de best ye can; and I'll watch&#xD;
ye long as I can see ye."&#xD;
Mignon left the tent ; a single glance over the&#xD;
encampment assured her that the moment was&#xD;
favorable. Moving quickly, her figure was soon&#xD;
lost to Balaam's view in the shadow of the hill,&#xD;
at the base of which lay the valley. Five minutes&#xD;
after, lie saw her near the cotton-woods, and&#xD;
was certain she would reach it without discovery,&#xD;
which she did.&#xD;
It was then two hours past midnight. The&#xD;
moon was waning, and the stars seemed to look&#xD;
down through a mist of silver. The mountains&#xD;
were grim and cold, the snows on their sum-&#xD;
mits gleaming faintly and weirdly in the pale&#xD;
light,&#xD;
To Mignon's imagination the view appeared&#xD;
like giant castles, with lofty towers, gloomy bas-&#xD;
tions, and rugged turrets. The defiles were&#xD;
moats spanned by drawbridges kept by genii.&#xD;
Feelings of awe stole upon Mignon as she cast&#xD;
her eyes toward those mighty barriers. The&#xD;
mightiness of nature, the grandeur of her works,&#xD;
humbled her heart. The ever famished prairie-&#xD;
dogs barked and fled at her advance, -stopping&#xD;
at a little distance to look back and redouble&#xD;
their cries ; while occasionally, in the distance&#xD;
a troop of wolves howled their hideous notes.&#xD;
Though inured 'to these sounds, Mignon-=now&#xD;
that she was alone-if not absolutely terrified,&#xD;
was startled and nervous. There followed her&#xD;
also an unpleasant remembrance of what had&#xD;
occurred that night directly before her, as well&#xD;
&#xD;

REDPATH.  549&#xD;
&#xD;
48&#xD;
&#xD;
REDPATH.&#xD;
&#xD;
as incidents of a similar nature that had happen-&#xD;
ed in Brion's band. As others had asked so did&#xD;
Mignon, "Who is Redpath ?"&#xD;
tier better judgment told her that Redpath was&#xD;
a savage, cunning and deadly, and that was all.&#xD;
But why were his movements so secret, his step&#xD;
so noiseless, his approaches so-mysterious ? Easy&#xD;
questions to answer. He was secret because&#xD;
success depended upon secrecy ; his step noise-&#xD;
less for the reason that he adopted extraordinary&#xD;
precautions ; his approaches mysterious as the&#xD;
combined result of long practice and skill. Red-&#xD;
path, then, was but a stealthy Indian, more&#xD;
malevolent than his brethren, hence more. terri-&#xD;
ble. He was daring, persevering and adroit, but&#xD;
perhaps he might yet find an adversary as daring,&#xD;
persevering and adroit as he. He was but a&#xD;
savage daubed with paint and full of subtlety;'&#xD;
he would doubtless fall, ultimately, by the ball&#xD;
of an American woodsman, and his name and&#xD;
fame only survive.&#xD;
Thus reflected Mignon, trying to suppress&#xD;
those fears which were natural to the time and&#xD;
place, and in which something very like super-&#xD;
stition blended. Say what we may to the con-&#xD;
trary, the strongest minds have an undercurrent&#xD;
of superstition, and the sturdiest scoffers at the&#xD;
marvellous find a substratum of supernaturalism&#xD;
in their souls. This is a truism that the "athe-&#xD;
ist's laugh" and the infidel's ridicule cannot&#xD;
overthrow. It is a good thing for .man that&#xD;
there is such a susceptibility within him; it is&#xD;
the only avenue through which to convince him&#xD;
of the existence of a Supreme power, and a con-&#xD;
scious life hereafter. Mignon formed no excep-&#xD;
tion to the general body of humanity, in this&#xD;
respect; and though the name of Redpath had&#xD;
at first presented as a fabled terror, she shared&#xD;
unconsciously, almost, in the prevailing senti-&#xD;
ment of the trappers, hunters and voyageurs-&#xD;
that Redpath was a being somewhere between&#xD;
human and devilish.&#xD;
Near the cotton-woods where she was to wait&#xD;
the coming of Balaam, was a crevasse or gully,&#xD;
the entrance to which was more deeply pictured&#xD;
in shadow. Its sides were jagged and high, worn&#xD;
and torn (formerly) by a strong stream of water&#xD;
that tumbled from the lower ranges in a season&#xD;
of rain. At the top, at the very edges of the&#xD;
crevasse, their roots exposed and robbed of soil,&#xD;
stood some trees of pinon, -cypress and birch,&#xD;
bending their sickly tops over the chasm. The&#xD;
place, lonely and sombre as it was, appeared to&#xD;
offer to Mignon a safe retreat until the black&#xD;
&#xD;
should join her. With a step that faltered, lack-&#xD;
ing its wonted firmness, she passed into the&#xD;
gloom of the crevasse. It was cooler there, the&#xD;
night wind breathing through as it crept from&#xD;
the hills. Walking on, she came to a deep dell&#xD;
or basin-a spot of rare obscurity-of which we&#xD;
have had occasion to speak. Beyond were a series&#xD;
of elevations extending to the base qf the Wind&#xD;
River chain of the Rocky Mountains.&#xD;
Mignon paused in that solitude. How com-&#xD;
plete was her isolation ! she seemed alone on the&#xD;
face of the globe, or the only inhabitant of a&#xD;
new world. Hundreds of miles distant were the&#xD;
familiar objects of childhood, scenes indelibly&#xD;
impressed in memory, home with its tender as-&#xD;
sociations and kindred beloved. Why was she&#xD;
in that isolation ? Why had she cast aside the&#xD;
trammels of her sex, and betaken to such a quix-&#xD;
otic adventure ? To save her father from par-&#xD;
ticipation in crime, and to secure, if possible, the&#xD;
safet fof Captain Brion, was the never varying&#xD;
respo WI  which she gave to those questions.&#xD;
Tier father's name always came first, afterward&#xD;
Brion's ; that order agreed better with her deli-&#xD;
cacy. How would the- sententious world inter-&#xD;
pret all this ? the world with such a-severe sense&#xD;
of decorum-the world which reaches just as far&#xD;
as one's \name and fame, and no farther, all be-&#xD;
yond being a blank !&#xD;
" Fear not !" said a voice.&#xD;
Mignon recoiled and cried out in alarm; be-&#xD;
side her stood a tall and motionless figure.&#xD;
"Be not afraid, paleface."&#xD;
The speaker was an Indian of majestic height.&#xD;
With his arms folded upon his breast, he stood&#xD;
looking calmly at Mignon.&#xD;
" Stand up like a man and do not tremble like&#xD;
a woman. Ravenclaw strikes not such as thou !&#xD;
Thy chin is smooth, thy heart is soft, and there&#xD;
is no power in thy arm to harm my race.",&#xD;
The voice of the red man was deep and musi-&#xD;
cal; it came from his broad chest without effort.&#xD;
His eyes were dark and piercing as those of the&#xD;
eagle; it seemed to Mignon that she became&#xD;
transparent before him, and he had to look at&#xD;
her only, to see what was 'passing within. His&#xD;
bearing was dignified to a notable degree. He&#xD;
spoke the English as if it had been his ver-&#xD;
nacular.&#xD;
"The vagabond prairie-dog has a home, the&#xD;
fox a covert, and the wild wolf's whelp a den;&#xD;
but thou, 0 son of a mighty nation, art shelter-&#xD;
less," added the Indian.&#xD;
" Take the goat from the mountains, the buf-&#xD;
&#xD;
falo from the prairies, the wild horse from the&#xD;
pampas, the fish from the water, and thee from&#xD;
the dwellings of thy kindred. Each thing and&#xD;
creature loves its element ; therefore the goat&#xD;
stays on the mountain, the buffalo on the prairie,&#xD;
the wild horse on the pampas, the fish in the&#xD;
water; wherefore art thou here ?"&#xD;
"You say well; you -speak according to na-&#xD;
ture; but it would take long to tell you, son of&#xD;
the eagle, why I am in the country which the&#xD;
Master of Life has given to the red man," replied&#xD;
Mignon, re-assured by the lofty yet kindly man-&#xD;
ner of the native.&#xD;
Ravenclaw walked a few paces from Mignon&#xD;
and addressed some one in his own dialect; im-&#xD;
mediately she heard steps hurrying away. Ra-&#xD;
venclaw returned to his former place ; but as he&#xD;
did not speak, she followed his example. In a&#xD;
short time-it was long to Mignon-an Indian&#xD;
woman appeared with a bundle.&#xD;
"Follow her, and do as she bids you,' d&#xD;
Ravenclaw, pointing to the woman; heI&#xD;
spoke to the latter in his own tongue, who, %k-&#xD;
ing a gesture to Mignon, proceeded to cross the&#xD;
dell. There Mignon perceived a hut and enter-&#xD;
ed it in obedience to the signs of her guide. The&#xD;
woman lighted a pine torch by some embers&#xD;
that were glowing upon a hearth of stone.&#xD;
Thrusting the end of the torch into the earth,&#xD;
she unrolled the bundle. The maiden's cheeks&#xD;
crimsoned-the bundle contained- female wear-&#xD;
ing apparel of Indian style, which might-have&#xD;
belonged to an Indian belle, so elaborately was&#xD;
it made, and so tastefully ornamented with those&#xD;
products esteemed graceful and becoming by&#xD;
tawny dames and red damsels.&#xD;
The Blackfoot woman pointed to Mignon's&#xD;
clothes and said, "Take off," then to the gar-&#xD;
ments which she had brought and added, "Put&#xD;
on."&#xD;
The eyes of Ravenclaw had penetrated her&#xD;
disguise. Was her artifice so transparent to this&#xD;
son of the mountains ? Had nature indeed gift-&#xD;
edhim with keener instincts than the child of&#xD;
cities, the pampered creature of civilization ?&#xD;
Was she a prisoner ? What were his intentions ?&#xD;
Such queries ran rapidly through her mind,&#xD;
while' mechanically she obeyed the commands&#xD;
of the woman.&#xD;
A notable change was soon made in Mignon's&#xD;
appearance, and one that was far from displeas-&#xD;
ing. We cannot picture fully to the reader's&#xD;
imagination the effect of this novel costume&#xD;
(wrought as it was in the height of Indian art),&#xD;
&#xD;
or note the various articles of which it was com-&#xD;
posed, nor is it needful. We will say, however,&#xD;
en passant, that Mignon's small foot did not look&#xD;
less pretty for the substitution of a more elegant&#xD;
moccason, nor her ankle less dainty for the&#xD;
fringed leggins. Her toilet was not considered&#xD;
complete till her cheeks were stained with paint&#xD;
and her hands also. The woman then spread&#xD;
some skins upon-the ground before the tent, and&#xD;
Ravenclaw, seeing her with Mignon, approached.&#xD;
"Daughter of-the paleface," he said,** I am&#xD;
of a warlike race, but I do not war upon women.&#xD;
Now tell me why you are here? I will listen--.&#xD;
my ears are open."&#xD;
Mignon understood at once that the wishes of&#xD;
the man in whose presence she stood were com-&#xD;
mands, and not to be disregarded.&#xD;
" It were better," she answered, with tact,&#xD;
" that I remain silent before a great chief and a&#xD;
mighty warrior, as thy lofty bearing proclaims&#xD;
thee to be. I have -.called thee son of the eagle,&#xD;
because the eagle is a noble bird with a daring&#xD;
spirit, proud plumage, and eyes that are not&#xD;
dazzled by the sun.' Pass on, thou of the strong&#xD;
wing, nor stoop in thyfiight to notice the spar-&#xD;
row that flies not so high, nor emulates thy&#xD;
deeds."&#xD;
"I said my ears were open ; they are, but&#xD;
I hear nothing. Are you speaking, Lilyface ?"&#xD;
he said, somewhat haughtily,&#xD;
" You have called me Lilyface, because the&#xD;
pale blood of my nation betrays itself in my&#xD;
countenance. It is a good name, I like it ; I&#xD;
will teach my people to call me thus should I&#xD;
live to return. Listen, chief; the lodge of Lily-&#xD;
face is away on the border, with an hundred prai-&#xD;
ries and rivers between.  She has journeyed&#xD;
many days to reach the hunting-grounds of the&#xD;
Blackfoot. You have asked why she came ?&#xD;
Keep your ears open and yoi shall'hear."&#xD;
Mignon, in that style pleasing to an Indian's&#xD;
fancy, acquainted him with those particulass&#xD;
which influenced her movements. She spoke of&#xD;
Brion; described the character of Pierre Mariot,&#xD;
finally unfolding his entire plan. 'Ravenclaw&#xD;
remained calm and unmoved ; while Mignon&#xD;
watched his face in vain to note the effect of her&#xD;
story. The incidents of the march were not&#xD;
passed over, but related-in their appropriate con-&#xD;
nection. When she finished, Ravenclaw was in&#xD;
possession of the more important matters con-&#xD;
tained in the foregoing pages.&#xD;
"A curse is upon your nation," said Raven-&#xD;
claw. " That curse is the love of yellow dust ;&#xD;

REPATIL&#xD;
&#xD;
Ueadley and his party, excited by their new hopesI&#xD;
and schemes, were among the first to awake.&#xD;
They had dreamed-of a golden harvest, and the&#xD;
" Casa Montezuma."   The partisan had not-&#xD;
betaken to his blanket until nearly daylight, and&#xD;
weary with his vigils he was yet slumbering.&#xD;
Mariot was not to be seen. The gold-seek&#xD;
ers, drawn together by sympathy of feeling, were&#xD;
cooking their breakfast very amicably. Inqui-&#xD;
ries' were made. respecting the absence of the&#xD;
grand projector of the new enterprise. Headley&#xD;
only appearing undisturbed by the circumstance,&#xD;
he was naturally looked to for light upon the&#xD;
subject.&#xD;
" He left us last night," said Headley, in -a&#xD;
low tone. " He came to see me before he went,&#xD;
and instructed me what to do. ' If I don't re-&#xD;
turn,' he said, ' before morning, you need not&#xD;
expect me, but fall back 'to the Red Buttes with&#xD;
as many as have the courage to follow you,&#xD;
where we will arrange everything to mutual sat-&#xD;
isfaction.' This was what he told me."&#xD;
Headley arose with a determined look.&#xD;
"I am one that goes, who will follow?"' he&#xD;
added, glancing inquiringly at his friends.&#xD;
"Let us go for our horses," said Conroy.&#xD;
"Agreed, agreedI" cried a dozen voices. " To&#xD;
the Red Buttes-to the Red Buttes !"&#xD;
Buckeye was passing the malcontents, and&#xD;
heard enough to ' understand what was going&#xD;
forward ; he ran and aroused Brion from sleep.&#xD;
" Come, cap'n, it's time for you to act; the&#xD;
Headley and Dorelle party are deserting."&#xD;
Brion was instantly upon his feet and walking&#xD;
toward the horses, which, having eaten their&#xD;
fill, were lying down.&#xD;
"Aint you going' to call out some of the men&#xD;
to help you?" asked Buckeye.&#xD;
" No, I can help myself," said the partisan,&#xD;
firmly.&#xD;
He foundileadley bridling a horse, and others&#xD;
preparing to do the same.&#xD;
" Men," said Brion, " these animals belong to&#xD;
the American Fur' Company; you cannot take&#xD;
them,"&#xD;
Headley was confused.&#xD;
" What I" he exclaimed, " have we not ridden&#xD;
- these horses since the hour we left Fort Leaven-&#xD;
worth ?"&#xD;
"So you have had the light of the moon, but&#xD;
I think you do:not oun'the moon," repliedBrion,&#xD;
quietly._&#xD;
" We have ridden these animals, we have-&#xD;
called them ours, we ae groomed and cared&#xD;
&#xD;
for them, and we shall take them !" rejoined&#xD;
Headley, raising the saddle from the ground.&#xD;
"Stop,!" thundered the partisan, " do not add&#xD;
robbery to unmanly conduct. Everything you&#xD;
see here is in my charge, and I will spend the&#xD;
last drop of my blood in its defence !  o, if you&#xD;
will, in search of the Casa Montezuma, and the&#xD;
fabulous treasures of the Valley of the Gila, but&#xD;
go as you are. You shall not plunder my camp&#xD;
for the benefit of your mad schemes. Had you.&#xD;
made known to me the cause of your dissatisfac-&#xD;
tion, and informed me of your intentions to&#xD;
abandon my party and seek for treasure in a&#xD;
distant region, I would in turn have dealt frank-&#xD;
ly with you; I would have told you that you&#xD;
are being duped by a villain; but this is past,&#xD;
you are unworthy of my confidence. Go and&#xD;
learn by bitter experience that you should deal&#xD;
honestly with all men, nor disregard solemn&#xD;
compacts. I see here thirteen, who cease from&#xD;
this moment to be members of my band, Leave&#xD;
us at once, and never return-unless as penitent&#xD;
and reasonable men desiring protection."&#xD;
"Protection=!" sneered Headley.&#xD;
"By the beard of Joe Smith !" cried Back-&#xD;
eye, who had followed Brion ; " you'll need it !"&#xD;
"Then doubtless we shall call upon you !"&#xD;
returned Conroy.&#xD;
"Shoulder your rifles, my   friends," said&#xD;
Headley, to his adherents.&#xD;
"To the Iced Buttes-to the Red Buttes !"&#xD;
shouted others.&#xD;
"I pity these misguided men, my anger yields,&#xD;
to compassion," said the partisan to Buckeye, in&#xD;
a low tone.&#xD;
'It's sympathy wasted, cap'n ; it isn't in 'em&#xD;
to be wise and prudent, especially while that tall&#xD;
Missourian is among 'em. The quicker you get&#xD;
rid of such fellers the better; for they aint fit&#xD;
for your business, and never will be," answered&#xD;
Buckeye,&#xD;
" Though indignant at your conduct, I regret&#xD;
to see you rushing blindfold into new difficulties&#xD;
and dangers. Men, let me warn you to shun&#xD;
Dorelle, and make your way with as much secre-&#xD;
cy andexpeditionas possible-to Fort Laramie,"&#xD;
resumed Brion, addressing the gold-seekers&#xD;
once more.&#xD;
" You speak of difficulties and dangers as&#xD;
though there were none attending your expedi-&#xD;
tion, and we were not at this moment turning&#xD;
our backs upon them," said Conroy,&#xD;
"Once more, my friends-shoulder a     m-&#xD;
march ! If we cannot have our horses, we can&#xD;
&#xD;
E 1 lPATH.&#xD;
&#xD;
go on foot, and trust to luck-and Monsieur&#xD;
Dorelle."&#xD;
The gold-seekers fell into marching order, and&#xD;
moved off in quite a spirited manner.&#xD;
"Dim-sighted fools !"  exclaimed- Buckeye.&#xD;
"They are marching to destruction 1"&#xD;
" Or to join the, Rocky Mountain Fur Com-&#xD;
pany," added Brion.r&#xD;
"They wont do it, even if the alternative be&#xD;
presented ; they've got their minds puffed up&#xD;
with ideas of treasure and sudden wealth, and&#xD;
that's a hard notion to get rid on. They'll in-&#xD;
sit on the original project."&#xD;
"As long as they think there's any truth in it,"&#xD;
said Brion.&#xD;
"And Mariot wont tell 'em he's lied, in a&#xD;
hurry."&#xD;
" Well, they have provoked their fate what-&#xD;
ever it may be. My party is minus thirteenmen;&#xD;
thirteen from seventy-two leaves fifty-nine."&#xD;
"You'ye lost thirteen men, but your band&#xD;
isn't weakened; it's strengthened; because the&#xD;
remainder are disciplined somewhat, have ex-&#xD;
perience, and can be commanded. Men that&#xD;
wont be governed aint the kind for your purpose,&#xD;
cap'n."--.                           -&#xD;
WhileS this scene' was transpiring, the main&#xD;
body of the party were quietly eating breakfast&#xD;
around -their respective'fires.&#xD;
The sun was rising above the level of the&#xD;
eastern prairies ; he came up like a ball of liquid&#xD;
tie. Soft and grateful zephyrs, bearing aro-&#xD;
matic odors, breathed around the mountaineer as&#xD;
he walked thoughtfully about the encampment,&#xD;
giving orders. The events of the morning had&#xD;
induced him to change his mind in regard to&#xD;
hunting the buffalo. His camp was in,' a situa-&#xD;
tion too much exposed to be left in charge of a&#xD;
small party, which would necessarily be the case'&#xD;
should he send out twenty or thirty i of his band&#xD;
to hunt. He therefore formed the resolution of&#xD;
moving forward to a canon a few miles farther&#xD;
on. Once in possession of the. canon he could&#xD;
hold his ground against a large body of enemies&#xD;
with half his company; but he was :suspicions&#xD;
that it was occupied by savages, who were wait-&#xD;
ing a favorable opportunityto attack them, either&#xD;
while'they were hunting or scattered on the&#xD;
march, and unprepared for resistance. ' his&#xD;
suspicion was produced by what he had heard&#xD;
when listening-to the conversation of Mariot and&#xD;
Beavertaker, and the -suggestions previously&#xD;
made by the former in regard to his route, he&#xD;
having advised hint 't keep near the tirountais&#xD;
4_&#xD;
&#xD;
53&#xD;
&#xD;
Accompanied by Buckeye, Brion mounted&#xD;
and rode toward the canon. - It was a fixed pin'&#xD;
ciple with the latter, always to take the'odst  f&#xD;
danger, and be the foremost in situations requir-&#xD;
ing 'courage-and skill. When' approaching a&#xD;
place where an enemy *ai known 'to be pona&#xD;
cealed, he asked no one to solve the matter, but&#xD;
settled the question by his own personalbravery&#xD;
and tact. If the front was theatened he wasIn&#xD;
the front, if the .rear, he Was in the rear, taking&#xD;
at once the-responsibility and the risk.&#xD;
"Get up,'Flash!" said Backeye, giving his&#xD;
horse'the rein.&#xD;
While the parties were galloping ^ toward the&#xD;
canon, the clatterbf hoofs arrested their atten-&#xD;
tion.' The sounds came from beyond a small&#xD;
strip of timber forty or fifty rods ahead, and pres-&#xD;
ently two persons turned the wood and drew in&#xD;
sight.&#xD;
" Ingins !" exclaimed Buckeye.&#xD;
"No," replied Brin "one is a negro.r&#xD;
"And' the other'is an Ingin woman or gal, or&#xD;
somethin' of that natur."&#xD;
"It would seem so," said the partisan, ob-&#xD;
serving the advancing persons sharply. "Atall&#xD;
events, their intentions are not -hostile,""he&#xD;
added.&#xD;
" By the beard of Smith !" cried Buckeye,&#xD;
" that nigger feller is ridin' the same hoess that&#xD;
that youngster rode' who fell in with ius tetherr&#xD;
day."&#xD;
" The resemblance is striking, I confess," re-&#xD;
turned'Brion.&#xD;
" There's no resemblance about it  i1's the&#xD;
same," rejoined the other.&#xD;
"It is very possible," rejoined the partisan.,&#xD;
The objedts of these. remarks approached.'&#xD;
"Are youi lookin', cap'n ?" asked Buckeye, i&#xD;
a low voice.&#xD;
" am," said Brion.              -&#xD;
"Isn't she oncommon ! what a'  efi what a&#xD;

" Handsome, certainly," returned the'patstis.&#xD;
"Bewitchin', cap'n !" added Buckeye, wit&#xD;
increasing enthusiasm  *&#xD;
" Beware that you 'do hot fall 'brdove with ahs&#xD;

If the appearange;of the Indian maiden pro-&#xD;
4wped such a marked e~ect"upon Buckeye, what&#xD;
must have been the emotions of Brion,. who be-&#xD;
lievedthat in her he recognized the face and&#xD;

of the previous night had prepared the- way to&#xD;

Ba     , he was niot one to, forget them; and he&#xD;
was well assured by the few words he heard him&#xD;
utter on that occasion, that he would never be&#xD;

9f the mountaineer was agitated by doubt, love,&#xD;
fear, admiration.  Mignos approached, while&#xD;
Balaau-chscked his horse and,-fell fin the rear.&#xD;
Wbiei near enough she raised hereyes and asked.&#xD;
"Is not tis Captain Brion, thepartisan of the&#xD;

"I bWe that to say which must be ,my. excuse&#xD;
for appearing befpre you in thisfgarb, and under&#xD;
circumstances so peculiar," she added, averting&#xD;
her eyes, her cheeks ' ecoming-suddenly suffused.&#xD;
Brion's brave heart, beat rapidly. The jnod-&#xD;

me pail and confusion. You wonder why I am&#xD;
here ; it is'to warn you of the danger Of which I&#xD;
have spoken, this is why I am before you.",&#xD;
"For me !" exclaimed Brion, astounded, at&#xD;
such ,a declaration.&#xD;
ucarh me; the danger which threatened you&#xD;
compromised the honor of one who is dear to&#xD;
me," rejoined Mignon.&#xD;
If the declaration she had first made filled him&#xD;
with hope, the last avowal dispelled it. One'&#xD;
who-was " dear to her !" Ah, that must be a&#xD;
lever or a husband!&#xD;
"You are the victim of a wicked scheme,&#xD;
which has for its object the destruction of your&#xD;
party. The man to whom belongs the paternity&#xD;
of this plot, will not fail through softness of&#xD;
heart or scruples of conscience."&#xD;
" May I ask his name ."&#xD;
" I cannot tell you-it would involve another.&#xD;
If Ican-defeat him without exposing him, Iwill."&#xD;
"lHe is Pierre Mariot," said Brion.&#xD;
Mignon grew pale.&#xD;
"It is too true," she answered. " You' have&#xD;
discovered the secret."&#xD;
I even know you ,"resumed the mountaineer.&#xD;
Atignoa looked up in alarm.&#xD;
" Will'you speak -my name?" she added.&#xD;
"Mademoiselle Belimar ; those to  whom&#xD;
friendship gives the right to address you familiar-&#xD;
ly call yo  Mignon."&#xD;
Mignon's face became crimson. A lovelier&#xD;
countenance could not have been presented to&#xD;
the gaze of the mountaineer.'- His sympathies,&#xD;
his love, his soul itself seemed to pass over to&#xD;
a Mignon. He idealized her perfections, he spirit-&#xD;
r ualized her beauty. The conquest which began&#xD;
at Westport was, now complete. Mignon be-&#xD;
t came  all that was divine in woman.  Brion&#xD;
- wished to kneel at her-feet and do homage.&#xD;
S"You are right," she responded, pensively.&#xD;
o   "And doyou remember that we once met?"&#xD;
n    " Well, it was at night; you laid me under ob-&#xD;
ligations which I shall not forget."&#xD;
f   "And did you imagine that 1 could forget,&#xD;
- Mademoiselle Bellmar ? .Pardon mry boldness,&#xD;
but your idea has been with me ever since. I&#xD;

kill him as I would a wolf, and his accursed a&#xD;
and mystery would perish with him."&#xD;
The mountaineers were bending over the&#xD;
horses' necks looking atdtheifigure ; the air wa&#xD;
slightly disturbed, and something passed betwee&#xD;
the  adsruc te object at which they wer&#xD;
looking with a sharp concussion. Both instine&#xD;
tivey dew bck- log arrow was quivering i&#xD;
thetree. For a moment Brion was too muc&#xD;
astonished to speak or to act.&#xD;
"By the beard of'Smith !" said Buckeye.&#xD;
Thesound of his voice aroused the partisan&#xD;
putting'spurs to his horse he dashed toward the&#xD;
timber.-&#xD;
"By heavens I" he muttered. " I will make&#xD;
an attempt to solve this mystery."&#xD;
He urged his horse into the wood, which being&#xD;
free from underbush, offered but little i'mpedi&#xD;
ment ; he galloped through and around it,and&#xD;
came back with his animal heated and foaming.&#xD;
"Why do ' you sit motionless Why'  not&#xD;
make an effort to find this invisible archer&#xD;
asked the trapper.&#xD;
"A sense of gratitude fastens me here, cap'n."&#xD;
"A sense of gratitude IIdo not understand."&#xD;
"It is jes' here,: consider, and you'll' perceive&#xD;
that.the"arim that sent that shaft directly to the&#xD;
head of that figure, could as easily have sent it&#xD;
through your head or mine."&#xD;
"That is a very just conclusion, Buckeye. I&#xD;
did not pause to think of nice points ; but indeed&#xD;
.I could scarcely' find iin my heart to draw a&#xD;
hair sight on one, who, having my life in his,&#xD;
power'did not take it. In this you have acted&#xD;
wisely.. -Yes, the eye that aimed that ball could&#xD;
have aimed it at a human' brain instead of an&#xD;
insentient one like that. What a narrow bound-&#xD;
ary lies between us and death 1" .&#xD;
",Scarcely wider tian the edge of my hunting'&#xD;
knife."                  ede.f y;unin&#xD;
"Ah, luckeye, we must travel that trail&#xD;
sometime!"'&#xD;
"A strange road-a strange road ! And it's&#xD;
been used a ood da, rtoo."&#xD;
"Death is at times, a cold and awful mystery&#xD;
to me,, but not always. What is it to yoeI"&#xD;
"I expectmy mind is     dark and ignorant&#xD;
oine,' but it t'oo often seems to, me'an  eternal&#xD;

&#xD;
ne    "That is not the most cheerful belief imagina-&#xD;
)d ble, but far better than a future of pait"&#xD;
Id While Brion was thus conversing his hands&#xD;
rt were not idle ; he was cutting the arrow fm the&#xD;
tree with his hatchet, which, when extractedlid&#xD;
ir examined with a feeling of intense curiosity.&#xD;
is The sharp, polished, tapering steel head, deli.&#xD;
n cately small, the long smooth shaft attalied&#xD;
'e had for him a peculiar interest, connected as they&#xD;
e- were with the fate of Townsend' and Minten,&#xD;
n, Stringer and Grenier.&#xD;
h "It is wondrously well wrought, 'he remarked.&#xD;
"And marvellously well sped, too," added'&#xD;
Buckeye.&#xD;
j "I will keep it as a memento of Redpath."&#xD;
e "Also to make you think, perhaps, thai'1e=&#xD;
mate to it istkept for you; and you will some-&#xD;
etime receive it."&#xD;
The canon was now near' at hand, and as they&#xD;
drew in sight of it, the partisan saw a hurnan'&#xD;
- form standing upon the summit of a high. elig,&#xD;
I which he quickly pointed out to the tripper. 'The&#xD;
sun was shining upon the jagged elevation glo-&#xD;
riously, making the figure appear as if clothed in&#xD;
garments of flame. He gazed down 'upon the'&#xD;
horsemen a moment, waved his hand and dis-&#xD;
appeared.&#xD;
Brion looked inquiringly at his' coiipanion.&#xD;
"It may be the evil one' himself; he shoe&#xD;
li'e a pillar of fire '" suggeste'd'iukeye.&#xD;
"His majesty has a majestic figure, then.'&#xD;
"He can assume any shape, undoubtedi."&#xD;
The mountaineers entered the cano, passed&#xD;
through it; it sheltered no visible enemy, anl&#xD;
they turned their horses' heads toward the en-&#xD;
camprent of the previous night, Brion entirelyy&#xD;
absorbed in thought.&#xD;
"Do you know,' said Buckeye;'.interrut ing&#xD;
his reverie, "that Redpath is not, the only ee&#xD;
among us that is dangerous 7 Thereis one who&#xD;
aims not at the head but at the heart, and 'her&#xD;
arrows go straight'as a rifle ball."&#xD;
Brion .writhed' under the trapper's raillery , butt&#xD;
deemed it wisest to keep silent.'&#xD;
"And yet this fair archers th sgli the doesn't&#xD;
aim. at the head, affects 'the, brains not,~ 'little&#xD;
with her pretty arrows, which are launched froth&#xD;
her sparklin' eyes.,'&#xD;
The mountaineer confessed, internally,tit&#xD;
there was: truth in this metaphor, inasmuch: as&#xD;

T oey had made half the circuit of thebill be- "&#xD;
fom the scor sequencesof their inattention were bi&#xD;
apparent. A yell recalled Balsam to the outer C&#xD;
waking world, rudely, it must be confessed, but g&#xD;
eetumaljy. Mignon was the fir~t to realize the ce&#xD;
misfprtune that ha4 befallen the. She perceiv-&#xD;
ed aroun.,her a circle of dusky men, armed with w&#xD;
spears, knives and guns,; she had fallen into an r&#xD;
sappgsende of Indians.. The discovery was one&#xD;
to, try the flrmest nerves. Balsam, seeing a red 'c&#xD;

filed the o ender, then disengaging a small axe t&#xD;

fene of histeistress. Enraged at his resistance,&#xD;
they swarmed upon him in overwhelming num-s&#xD;

For a time the giant strength of the black pre-&#xD;

hurled by a ga~rrior took effect upon his head..&#xD;

seiflike a lign; then, even, Mignon believed he&#xD;
S iight lrove Unconquerable. He struck a few&#xD;
bopws, then eapk upop one knee, yetcontinuing'&#xD;
to resist and defy them in his own peculiar way.&#xD;
Per" ging hatbis strength was failing, he turn-&#xD;

manded them topist, adding that, eowarde&#xD;
wight he heckedand cut in piees but not brave&#xD;
en who sell: their lives dearly.' This umane&#xD;
Inden, however, did not waive the established&#xD;
usage of his race, and in a moment held up poor&#xD;
Balaam's scalp  At the sight ,of this reeking&#xD;
troph 'Mignon swooned.: When she recovered,&#xD;
shewas seated at the foot of a tree, hernbodysup-&#xD;
poited by the r. The natives were grouped&#xD;
together a few paces distant,.gpeaking earnestly&#xD;
in their own dialect, which-pounded harsh an&#xD;
&#xD;
horrible to Mignon. There seemed to be a diri'&#xD;
on of opinion among them which was finally&#xD;
ttled, as she judged by the altered tone of their,&#xD;
oices. The chief came and looked at ,her&#xD;
tentively.&#xD;
"You wear," said he in English so broken&#xD;
at we shall not attempt, to give, it .verbatim,&#xD;
the garb of a princess of the Blaolfoot nation,&#xD;
at your skin is pale. The Blackfoot and the&#xD;
row are enemies; they hate each.other-,--they&#xD;
o to war and take scalps--they put their prison-,&#xD;
nr to death. Palefaced woman, you must die'"&#xD;
"Do the warriors of. the Crow nation wage&#xD;
rar upon women ?" asked Mignon; striving to&#xD;
ally her courage.&#xD;
" They 'destroy their enemies," returned the&#xD;
hief.&#xD;
"Eneugeg are those who take the war-path;&#xD;
he women of the paleface nation never go upon,&#xD;
he war-path; they love 'peace4and remain at&#xD;
home."&#xD;
"Then why art thou here 1" said the chief,&#xD;
quickly.&#xD;
"Not to take life but to save it," ,ignon an-&#xD;
swered.&#xD;
"Like all your craven race, you shrink from,&#xD;
death."&#xD;
"And why should I notI Am I not young,&#xD;
and does no _-the young heart cling to exis-&#xD;
tence ? Women dia'well when the treat Spirit'&#xD;
calls; but they draw back from violence and&#xD;
blood."&#xD;
"The Grsat Spirit calls you now.&#xD;
"I cannot hear him."     =&#xD;
"le calls you through my voice; he bids you&#xD;
get ready."&#xD;
"The Orews are cowards or they would not&#xD;
kill wonin ;,brave men hold such deeds in hor-&#xD;
ror," rejoined Mignon.&#xD;
"'ale maiden, it is-better to die young than&#xD;
old. If you go to the land of souls now you wilt&#xD;
remaigli young and beautifWl forever ; but if you&#xD;
live till you are old and'wrinkled, you will enter,&#xD;
that country as such, and continue so."&#xD;
"Hear me: I have a father whoa 'has much.&#xD;
gold'; he -has .a' trading-house beyond yonder&#xD;
mountains where he keeps the hi ngs most.val&#xD;
nqd by, red. men; i;go there with me and you&#xD;
shall-be made rich abme all your tribe."&#xD;
The Indian paused a moment as if meditating&#xD;
upon what hq :hadheard, andt Mignon begsn to&#xD;
hope. ,&#xD;
"Yug sellhaye guns that never miss their&#xD;
aim, nmsun t    oigna last your life-time, blankets'&#xD;
&#xD;
f&#xD;
&#xD;
that defy the snows of the coldest winter, an&#xD;
horses that are swifter than the antelope an&#xD;
stronger than the buffalo.. With these you ca&#xD;
make war upon the Blackfeet, and' conquer&#xD;
them."&#xD;
" Palefaces have artful tongues, and the re&#xD;
man cannot tell when they speak the truth&#xD;
What you say sounds well, but you might lea&#xD;
us into the strong forts of the whites where w&#xD;
should be slain by the thunder of the great gins&#xD;
I have listened to you too long. The corn-spiri&#xD;
requires an offering, and he will not be cbnten&#xD;
save with a young and beautiful maiden such a&#xD;
thou art."&#xD;
" Will the manner of my death be painful ?&#xD;
Mignon asked.&#xD;
"White maiden, it will be painful, but.not o&#xD;
long duration," said the Crow. "In the lan&#xD;
of souls you will forget your sufferings and re&#xD;
joice to see the corn growing green and tall t&#xD;
feed our hungry children."&#xD;
"It is horrible !", exclaimed Mignon.&#xD;
"It is nought compared to the torture 'o&#xD;
three days, when twelve fies are lighted, and i&#xD;
the arts of inflicting pain are exhausted," he re&#xD;
plied, his face glowing with savage ferocity a'&#xD;
the recollection of the scenes he had witnessed.&#xD;
With these words he'left her and issued'orders&#xD;
which she could not understand. Presently sh&#xD;
was placed upon her horse, and the party 'set ofl&#xD;
toward the mountains. Mignon turned' a last&#xD;
lingering look toward the hill where she had ex&#xD;
pected to find friends and safety.&#xD;
She submitted to her captors with the helpless&#xD;
passivity of despair, her bowed head and droop-&#xD;
ing form testifying to her deep despondency.  '&#xD;
The Indians did not address her, and- the trail&#xD;
to the nearest Crow village was-traced silently.&#xD;
Tallbear, 'the chief, kept near her person, setting&#xD;
ai eample of taciturnity which was followed by&#xD;
his 'warriors. -&#xD;
They pressed forward   without stopping,&#xD;
though their progress. was slow. The gloomiest&#xD;
night that Mignon ever experienced approached,&#xD;
and-with it came clouds and a  shower of rain,&#xD;
attended with thunder and lightning. Tallbear&#xD;
ordered a halt; watching the heavens with anx-&#xD;
ious expression;&#xD;
"The Great 'Spirit- is angry," said Mignon,&#xD;
hoping- to turn the' elemental strife to her ad&#xD;
vantage.&#xD;
"Yes;"answered the chief, "he is angy bet&#xD;
cause the   i*   delayed."    '&#xD;
"Not so; u4br the reason that such a feari-&#xD;
&#xD;
d ful rite is contemplated. While- rebuking 'your&#xD;

n the same time gives yotd ain 'rdef esh y'lbur&#xD;
ir corn, and prove to you that he can make'li'row&#xD;
without your aid."&#xD;
d At that instant there was a terrific expldsidr&#xD;
. and the red, - quivering lightning 'played around'&#xD;
d them. The ground trembled 'with the violence&#xD;
e of the concussion. ' A  large' tree was shiveied&#xD;
s. from its topmost branches to the roots,i iean&#xD;
[t Indian wiho had been standing beneathr 'it as&#xD;
t stricken lifeless. Tallbear Was awed. Igne-ant'&#xD;
s of nature and her laws, thutider and lightning to&#xD;
him had supernatural origin, and indicated the&#xD;
displeasure of the Master of Life.&#xD;
" Behold," cried Mignon, "'the avenglida arm&#xD;
f of God! He has 'turned his hand against you;&#xD;
d he has smitten one of your brave's.  He is just,&#xD;
- he does well; to him I comihend my soul. Red&#xD;

-   While Mignon was speaking Iambedit fiaries&#xD;
t darting from  above played around her- pale&#xD;
cheeks.  Tallbear recoiled, ' conternelatin  het'&#xD;
s with pallid visage and parted lips.&#xD;
S    "fPaleface woman, thou art a great medicine! "&#xD;
F he exclaimed.&#xD;
t   "I am," she resumed, with more impressive&#xD;
emphasis, "but a perishable creature 'like thee,&#xD;

##I will ask him," said Mignon, closing her&#xD;
eyes;and crossingher arms'upon her breast ; she&#xD;
remained silent a' few moments, then addressing&#xD;
the chief :&#xD;
"The answer is (looking steadily at Tallbear),&#xD;
offer normore :bloody sacrifices to the corn-spirit,&#xD;
for there is but one God that presides over all&#xD;
thingsgand he is -the Master of Life."&#xD;
"Inquire yet again, and ask him what I shall&#xD;
do with the paleface woman ?"&#xD;
Mignon perceived that all depended on the&#xD;
skilfulness of her reply; 'she had reached the&#xD;
most delicate and critical point of her purpose.&#xD;
She closed her eyes and crossed her arms again,&#xD;
to gain time to form a fitting answer.&#xD;
"F'ind a woman among your people who has&#xD;
lost a daughter, and let her adopt this child of&#xD;
the paleface," she said.&#xD;
This reply was judicious, for the suspicions of&#xD;
Tallbear might have been aroused; had .she de-&#xD;
man    her liberty at once.&#xD;
°'   1lsend forour medicine men, and they&#xD;
shall fast three days and see if the Great Spirit&#xD;
will confirm this," returned the Indian.&#xD;
The Master of Life speaks but once to man;&#xD;
he never repeats ." exclaimed Mignon, with a&#xD;
dignity axed earnestness wondrous to Tallbear.&#xD;
"IThat is well; he never repeats," 'he said,&#xD;
then looking searchingly at his captive, added :&#xD;
"And he never denies !"&#xD;
"And he never denies," repeated Mignon, in&#xD;
the same tone. "But it becomes the awful Deity&#xD;
to remain silent when he has once declared his&#xD;
sovereign will-to man."&#xD;
"Speak again to the Great Spirit and ask if&#xD;
the prisoner will attempt to escape ?",&#xD;
Mignon saw at once the subtlety of this pro-&#xD;
position.'&#xD;
" Ihave done;" she said;,"his presence is&#xD;
departing-his chariot-wheels are rolling over&#xD;
- the mountains. Be content and humble. Speak&#xD;
to )ae no'more-I am dumb."    Mignon turn-&#xD;
ed her back to Tallbear, and assumed: her&#xD;
former silent and .hopeless attitude. Tallbear&#xD;
walked away and seated himself apart from his&#xD;
braves, apparently in a thoughtful mood. t  .&#xD;
Inv half an -hour the storm passed ; the rain&#xD;
ceased falling, the thunder was heard ; faintly&#xD;
rumbling at a great distance, while the lightning&#xD;
blazed against the .far-off sky with diminished&#xD;
brightness.&#xD;
the party went on again, and in two hours&#xD;
drew in sight-of a Crow village, in view of which.&#xD;
they halted, it being their custom when they had&#xD;
&#xD;
lost warrio-s not to enter their .village on their&#xD;
return, without an invitation from the friends of&#xD;
the slain. The dogs gave notice of their ap.&#xD;
proach, and in a short time the sleepy natives&#xD;
were astir, making suitable preparations to re-&#xD;
ceive their warriors, who, after considerable de-&#xD;
lay, were formally invited to enter the town.&#xD;
Mignon, though, an object of much curiosity,&#xD;
was treated with respect. - The tent which the&#xD;
unfortunate Balaam had succeeded in securing&#xD;
when his mistress left Callard's encampment,&#xD;
was taken from the horse upon which it had been,&#xD;
carefully packed, and set up for her exclusive&#xD;
use by Tallbear, who clearly intended to treat&#xD;
her with distinction until her fate should be de-&#xD;
cided by the "medicine men."&#xD;
The latter were called together early in the&#xD;
morning. The chief made them acquainted with&#xD;
his original intention of sacrificing Mignon to&#xD;
placate the corn-spirit; with what subsequently&#xD;
occurred during the storm of, thunder, and his,&#xD;
own determination to refer the matter to those&#xD;
skilled in the ways of the invisible powers.&#xD;
"Now go,"'he adde, " and have lodges built&#xD;
in some lonely spot, and fast according to your&#xD;
custom, and thus learn the will of the Manito of,&#xD;
your people."&#xD;
Whether it was that the " medicine men" had&#xD;
no relish for fasting three days, or whether they&#xD;
believed they had been already instructed, we are&#xD;
not able to avow; but they declared that the&#xD;
Master of Life had enlightened their mindA in&#xD;
dreams and visions ; and after a little time, if&#xD;
left undisturbed, they would make known his.&#xD;
wishes. The three medicine men accordingly,&#xD;
withdrew to a lodge which every person was for-&#xD;
bidden to approach. ,  recently Mignon heard&#xD;
the sound of an Indian drum and frantic yells&#xD;
proceeding from the lodge, and shuddered to&#xD;
think such wretches were to decide her fate&#xD;
They continued  their orgies some . hours---a&#xD;
period of dreadful anxiety to Mignon, Who,&#xD;
solitary in her tent, was awaiting the conclusion&#xD;
of the rites.&#xD;
Mignon's father was a Catholic ; but she had&#xD;
been educated in the Protestant religion, in har-&#xD;
mony with the views -of her deceased-,mother,&#xD;
and she now sought the consolations of the&#xD;
Christian faith. She petitioned God with that&#xD;
contrite fervor that her condition -was so well&#xD;
calculated to awaken,seeking that calm strength,&#xD;
that unshrinking fortitude he only can itspart.-&#xD;
" Daughter of the. paleface, come !". said a,&#xD;
voice.   "&#xD;
&#xD;
RED2PATH.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was Tallbear who spoke ; he had come to&#xD;
conduct her to hear the verdict of the med ejne&#xD;
men. She found the Indians assembled on a&#xD;
plateau near their village, in close neighborhood&#xD;
to a large field of corn. She followed with mod&#xD;
eat and melancholy mien,: her beauty and grace&#xD;
attracting much attention and remark.  The&#xD;
medicine men were in a circle formed by the&#xD;
principal men of the village ; next the latter were&#xD;
the braves, while the third and last ring was&#xD;
composed of women and children-a motley,&#xD;
clamorous rabble. When Mignon reached the&#xD;
central circle where the three prophets were&#xD;
awaiting her, Tallbear addressed them:&#xD;
"What," he asked, "says the Manito of the&#xD;
Crow nation ?"&#xD;
"-That the love of life is strong, and all wish&#xD;
to live to enjoy summer and sunshine."&#xD;
Mignon heard the rejoinder, and though she&#xD;
had made up her mind. for the worst, hope re-&#xD;
vived a little. "Summer.and sunshine 1" These&#xD;
words had a meaning they never before possess-&#xD;
ed. She could not refrain from raising her eyes&#xD;
toward the glorious luminary-the eternal lamp&#xD;
of nature. The refulgent beams gleamed as&#xD;
brightly upon her as in the days of her childhood,&#xD;
before she understood the meaning of the word.&#xD;
" death."  A gentle breeze from the west blew&#xD;
on her face and toyed with her hair.&#xD;
" 0, God !" she exclaimed, "why can I not&#xD;
enjoythis forever!, Why hast thou placed the&#xD;
grave before mortals, and called them to a bap-&#xD;
tism of pain ?"&#xD;
"Go on," said Tallbear.&#xD;
"And he added, moreover," 'resumed the&#xD;
spokesman of the medicine men, " that he speak-&#xD;
eth in thunder and fire ; that he createth all&#xD;
things, and causeth the Indian corn to grow."&#xD;
" I am saved !" thought Mignon.'. " God will'&#xD;
spare my youth!"&#xD;
The prophet went on.&#xD;
" But lest he might some time forget-the corn,&#xD;
he has given it in charge of a -powerful spirit&#xD;
whose duty it is to watch over it night and day.&#xD;
The paleface woman has said that the Master of&#xD;
Life- loveth not blood, butit was the God of the&#xD;
white man that told her so."&#xD;
" There is but one God !" said Mignon, who&#xD;
saw her last hope passing away.,&#xD;
"The red man does not serve the God of the&#xD;
pale faces," returned the prophet. "Every na-&#xD;
tion has its deity, and no, two are alike. We,&#xD;
follow the voice of the Great Spirit, and no other&#xD;
will we hear. Behold what he has given us !&#xD;
&#xD;

Look at the boundless hunting-grounds, the&#xD;
mighty plains, the shaded valleys, the green&#xD;
forests which he has kindly bestowed upon us.&#xD;
White woman, the Indian did not make himself,&#xD;
but one greater than he made him with all his&#xD;
instincts.: Can his nature change ? Can he be&#xD;
other than he is ? Who faults him will fault the&#xD;
great and eternal Master of Life. See me-re-&#xD;
gard me-study me ! I am what I am, not be-&#xD;
cause I had any voice in it, but because a will&#xD;
stronger than mine existing before I had con-&#xD;
sciousness, willed it so. My face is red--my na-&#xD;
ture is not soft and weak like yours ; it does&#xD;
not love cities and the arts of your people, it has&#xD;
joy in the hunt and on the war path. And why?&#xD;
Because it wasso' decreed. I am an Indian,&#xD;
and I thank the Great Spirit that I am ! Thus&#xD;
you see the power that created me reconciles me&#xD;
to be what I am, therefore he is wise. It is so&#xD;
with you. You will act true to your nature, and&#xD;
I shall to mine. The manners and cus ns, of&#xD;
nations differ. Our ways seem barbarou  you&#xD;
and yours are contemptible to us.  Pale girl,&#xD;
the corn-spirit is thirsty, we will give him drink."&#xD;
"Last night the Great Spirit sent rain," said&#xD;
Mignon.&#xD;
" He drinks not water," said the prophet.&#xD;
" 0, it is vain to struggle against fate !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Mignon.&#xD;
" Vain indeed !" added the Indian, in a deep,&#xD;
sepulchral voice. " Could those towering moun-&#xD;
tains have resisted the will, that placed them&#xD;
there for a barrier between us and the sea ?&#xD;
Could the snow have helped falling upon their&#xD;
summits ? Could you have struggled against his&#xD;
hand when he took up the dust to form you ?&#xD;
Know, 0 fair daughter of a hated race, that all&#xD;
things are ordered, and not anything can change.&#xD;
It being destined that you shall die, how can&#xD;
mortal power make you live? Cease to strug-&#xD;
gle, and meet calmly a fate that you cannot re-&#xD;
sist ; this is the lesson taught by everything in&#xD;
nature. Because you are a woman, and your&#xD;
flesh is tender and shrinks from pain, the Mas-&#xD;
ter of Life sends you an easy death."&#xD;
The prophet  nade a sign to Tallbear, who ap-&#xD;
proached with a small cord composed of the in-&#xD;
ner bark of a tree.&#xD;
For an instant Mignon experienced a fearful&#xD;
shrinking and a sickening agony of spirit ; but&#xD;
conquering measurably her weakness, she looked&#xD;
at the chief and demanded in a voice quite free&#xD;
from agitation, "What is the manner of my&#xD;
death ?"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"It is quick and easy ; an arrow will pierce&#xD;
your bosom, and you will be in the spirit-land of&#xD;
your fathers before one of yonder clouds can&#xD;
pass over the sun's face," he replied.&#xD;
" It is well; I am ready, but do not mutilate&#xD;
my person-bury my body on one df yonder&#xD;
high cliffs where the same sun that shines upon&#xD;
the wigwam of my father may shine on my&#xD;
ashen," said Mignon, submissively.&#xD;
Tallbear-came near to- bind her hands.&#xD;
" Take away the cord; since there is to be no&#xD;
torture, no protracted agony, to bind me were&#xD;
useless. Tell me where to stand, and I will&#xD;
present my breast to your marksman."&#xD;
" Pale girl, you have courage," said Tallbear,&#xD;
in a low tone. "I would save you if I could,&#xD;
for your voice has a wondrous melody in it, and&#xD;
your beauty is like that of the spirit-maidens in&#xD;
the far land of souls. - Maiden, the arrow that&#xD;
enters your bosom will give pain to the heart of&#xD;
Tallb  . But the Great Spirit is wise. It is&#xD;
better at you should be taken from my sight."&#xD;
Then in a louder voice : " Daughter of theLong-&#xD;
knives, we will not send you unprovided to the-&#xD;
land of shadows, your horses shall go with you,&#xD;
and your beautiful -lodge, that you may have a&#xD;
horse to ride and a lodge to dwell in."&#xD;
Tallbear waved his hand and the circling&#xD;
horde of- warriors, women and children opened&#xD;
before him.&#xD;
"Look!" said he, pointing through the nar-&#xD;
row lane thus made, "yonder are your horses,&#xD;
and your lodge has been taken down and packed&#xD;
upon them. When you reach the country of&#xD;
spirits, you Will not have long to wait for your&#xD;
horses; you will find everything as it was in&#xD;
this world, and the black man with the strong&#xD;
arms will be there to attend you; he is waiting&#xD;
you now, when he sees your large horse he will&#xD;
hasten to prepare him for your use, and he will&#xD;
hang your little rifle at the saddle if you should&#xD;
want to hunt the deer."&#xD;
Mignon saw the animals at a short distance,&#xD;
prepared as for a journey. The one she usually&#xD;
rode, seeing his mistress, 'erected his . ears and&#xD;
neighed; a proof of affection which called tears&#xD;
to her eyes. With a parting glance at the noble&#xD;
creature that had borne her uncomplainingly so&#xD;
many miles, she submitted herself to the com-&#xD;
mands of Tallbear.&#xD;
"Place me quickly, and -let it be soon over,"&#xD;
she said.        -&#xD;
The chief led her to the centre of the circle.&#xD;
"1This is the spot, here is a bandage to cover'&#xD;
&#xD;
your eyes., Your heurt is not big enough to,&#xD;
see the bow bent and the arrow pointed ; you&#xD;
will shrink and-run away, or swoon with terror."&#xD;
" I will do neither ; since -it is my duty to die,&#xD;
I will die as becornes the daughter of the great&#xD;
paleface nation !"&#xD;
There was a general inurmur of approbation.&#xD;
"It-is good," said Tallbear. Then in a whis-&#xD;
per, "Never had the corn-spirit a more beautiful&#xD;
offering. Your eyes are likeothose of the deer&#xD;
when the hunter's knife is at its throat, hanging&#xD;
over its small neck. - Pale girl, you have power&#xD;
over Tallbear !"&#xD;
The Indian gazed a- moment at Mignon with&#xD;
a softened expression-his strong band trembled&#xD;
while placing her in the attitude deemed fitting-&#xD;
and more than once he hesitated and looked at&#xD;
the horses'; some' half-formed purpose appeared&#xD;
to agitate him.&#xD;
" Maiden, be firm-the way to the land of,&#xD;
souls is toward the west, and your swift horses&#xD;
will fly like birds along the path."&#xD;
With a heavy breath much like a sigh of re=i&#xD;
gret, the chief left Mignon, who stood with her&#xD;
face toward the open space in the circle. The&#xD;
ribbon or scarf'of high-colored stuff which cov-&#xD;
ered the *upper portion of her person, was suffer-&#xD;
ed to fall a little upon the left side, while over&#xD;
the breast she placed the gift of Ravenclaw-a°&#xD;
raven wrought in beads.&#xD;
" Let your bowman aim at this ; my heart is&#xD;
beneath it," she said, with a calmness that sur.&#xD;
prised the grim warriors, and raised another&#xD;
hum of admiration.&#xD;
A sinewy Indian walked through the living&#xD;
avenue and-appeared at the margin of the se-&#xD;
cond circle. He carried a long-bow in his right&#xD;
hand,-which, -when held vertically beside him&#xD;
with one, end resting upon the ground, reached&#xD;
higher than his head. His quiver slung over&#xD;
his bare and brawny shoulder, contained but a&#xD;
single arrow pointed with bone.- He came with&#xD;
a lithe and-dignified step, and stopping -at the&#xD;
proper spot, stood erect before Mignon a few&#xD;
yards distant.- , She heard this coming and there&#xD;
was a quickened-motion of the snowy globe whieh&#xD;
was to be his mark. He glanced inquiringly at'&#xD;
-Tallbear ; the latter saw=him not; with 'folded&#xD;
arms, compressed-lips, and heaving chest, he was&#xD;
looking at Mignon. The red archer remainedriio-&#xD;
tionless; suddenly Tallbear turned toward him ;.&#xD;
his facewas flushed, there were beads of perspi-&#xD;
ration ot his forehead,'he made a hasty gesture&#xD;
.to the Indian who was waiting his- orders; he,&#xD;
&#xD;
took the arrow from the quiver and fitted it to&#xD;
the string. Mignon stirred not, trembled not,&#xD;
though conscious of the movement. The archer&#xD;
paused with the shaft levelled'at the figure of&#xD;
the raven upon Mignon's breast ; he :waited&#xD;
another signal when he would bend the tough&#xD;
fibres of the sturdy wood, and launch the arrow&#xD;
like lightning at the fairest mark man ever aim-&#xD;
ed at. Tallbear was in the act of giving that&#xD;
signal, and -the Indian was about to let fly his&#xD;
fatal shaft, when a bright object gleamed mo-&#xD;
mentarily in the air, and he fell forward upon&#xD;
his face. Immediately, before a warrior had&#xD;
moved, a grim and terrible figure bounded into&#xD;
the circle ; hisull was bare to the bone, his&#xD;
face black and 'streaked with blood; a savage&#xD;
fury and determination marked his motions. He&#xD;
caught Mignon in his arms, and with such a&#xD;
look as the lion casts upon those who kill her'&#xD;
young, bore her from the ring. No one spoke,&#xD;
not a hand grasped a knife, gun, or tomahawk-&#xD;
all tongues were mute, every warrior paralyzed.&#xD;
Mignon was lifted to the back of her favorite&#xD;
horse ; the reins were given her--she grasped&#xD;
them-she felt herself in rapid flight, and one&#xD;
who seemed to, her bewildered fancy like Ba-&#xD;
laam, was at her side.&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
NEW ADVENTURES IN THE CANON.&#xD;
BALAAM, it will be remembered, was stunned&#xD;
by a hatchet hurled effectively at his head by a&#xD;
warrior ; losing his seat, he finally sunk exhaust-&#xD;
;d beneath repeated wounds. He remained in-&#xD;
sensible a long time. The first premonition of&#xD;
returning life was a consciousness of pain. He&#xD;
became.sensible at last of some kind of an exis-&#xD;
tence without the ability to connect the past with&#xD;
the present, or to know where the thread of out-&#xD;
er life had been broken. His head glowing with&#xD;
a fiery heat, his eyes drowned in an abyss of&#xD;
darkness, his stiffened tongue, his throat hot and&#xD;
dry, a dull, weary motion of the heart made him,&#xD;
conscious of misery only, without awakening&#xD;
individualidentity.&#xD;
But Balaam's vital powers were. strong and&#xD;
able to resist much suffering; they prevailed at,&#xD;
length over wounds and bruises, restored sight&#xD;
to ,his swimmingvision, and activity to his brain.&#xD;
He raised his head from the ground, the red&#xD;
beams of the sunj' then at its meridian, glowing&#xD;
into his face, extinguished for an instant his&#xD;
newly restored sight.&#xD;
&#xD;
Presently he arose to his. feet, he saw one of&#xD;
Mignon's gloves lying near hirp, and it quicken-&#xD;
ed at once the sluggish current of memory. The&#xD;
thought of Mignon in danger absorbed him whol-I&#xD;
ly, to the utter exclusion of himself, his wounds,&#xD;
his wretched condition. He quenched his burn-&#xD;
ing thirst at the nearest stream, and then took'&#xD;
the trail of the savages with the eagerness of a'&#xD;
hound that scents his prey. His iron frame dis-&#xD;
dained its wounds, and his resolute soul, with&#xD;
the updying faithfulness of the dog, scorned&#xD;
physical pain and the gnawings of hunger. For-&#xD;
tunately for him, most of his hurts were not of a&#xD;
very dangerous character, the blow upon his head&#xD;
with the loss of his scalp, being the most serious;&#xD;
though his arms and, body were much hacked&#xD;
and scarred by knives and other weapons.&#xD;
Defying all' obstacles, Balaam tracked the red'&#xD;
robbers who had' wrested away his :precious&#xD;
charge, determined to save her or share her fate.&#xD;
In what manner he was to deliver her .he did&#xD;
not know- or even ask himself, 'so entirely were&#xD;
his still disordered faculties occupied in the idea&#xD;
of pursuit. He reached the Indian town at the&#xD;
moment when Mignon's fate seemed decided.&#xD;
He was going to throw himself upon the Indian&#xD;
with the bow and, crush him with his giant.&#xD;
strength, when a gleaming shaft passed him like&#xD;
lightning, and the tawny. archer fell, stricken'&#xD;
through the brain with a steel-headed arrow.&#xD;
We have related what then occurred. The In-&#xD;
dians, after the rescue of Mignon, took up the&#xD;
dead body of the warrior and retired in silence to&#xD;
their village.a It was to them evident that the&#xD;
Great Spirit was not pleased with what they had&#xD;
proposed.&#xD;
Mignon and Balaam had not proceeded far be-&#xD;
fore theydiscovered a party of men advancing,&#xD;
that proved to be Captain Brion, Buckeye, arid&#xD;
a select number of hardy 'mountaineers.- This"&#xD;
sudden, meeting, together with the singular&#xD;
plight of the black, - excited both inquiry and&#xD;
surprise ; and the latter gave place to gratitude&#xD;
when the startling experiences of Mignon and&#xD;
the negro had been properly set forth. No one;&#xD;
however, not excepting Balaam, was more thank-&#xD;
ful than the partisan for the wonderful escape of&#xD;
Mignon. -The revulsion of feeling was so great&#xD;
with her, when she fully realized that she was&#xD;
snatched from death and was safe with friends,&#xD;
that she lost her consciousness. Brion being the&#xD;
first to observe that she was fainting, caught lier&#xD;
in his arms, thus, timely preventing a fall frot'&#xD;
her horse. Balaam, too, now that the excite-&#xD;

.EDPAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
meant was over, felt the need of attention, and&#xD;
the poor fellow was immediately attended to-&#xD;
his wounds - dressed, his bravery praised, his&#xD;
fidelity lauded.  The purifying and cooling&#xD;
effects of water, and the comforting nature of&#xD;
brandy, were speedily tested, in -his case, with,&#xD;
the most happy effects. Hearty food was not.&#xD;
allowed him, but 'he wras permitted to swallow a&#xD;
portion of a biscuit with his arguardiente, when&#xD;
his vivacity being measurably restored, he was&#xD;
su-to utter several pleasantries at the expense&#xD;
of his sca,lpless cranium. The necessary sanato-&#xD;
ry operations having been attended to, the&#xD;
mountaineers resumed their way toward the&#xD;
canon in which the band had encamped the pre-&#xD;
vious day. The partisan placed himself near.&#xD;
Mignon, occasionally asking questions co'ncern-&#xD;
ing her capture, referring to his own anxiety,&#xD;
and detailing the efforts he had-made to find her.&#xD;
The account of her rescue was to, him intensely&#xD;
interesting. There was something perfectly in-&#xD;
apprehensible in that transaction. The idea of&#xD;
the mysterious Redpath was again evoked ; how&#xD;
could it be otherwise Had not the evidences&#xD;
of his presence been indubitable? ?^Unquestion-&#xD;
ably, yes. There had been a death from an ar-&#xD;
row in a manner that he had himself witnessed.&#xD;
"Mademoiselle Bellmar," he said, "it would&#xD;
appear that you owe your escape to the inter-&#xD;
position of that ever-present creature, Red-&#xD;
patht"&#xD;
"My mind has been in such a world of ex-&#xD;
citement and confusion since my unexpected es-&#xD;
cape, that I have not yet reflected calmly ;"but&#xD;
that I am indebted to Redpath, seems an inevita-&#xD;
ble conclusion-a conviction that ,forces itself&#xD;
upon me spontaneously, without the trouble of&#xD;
reasoning," she replied.&#xD;
"It would interest me, to' know what your&#xD;
ideaM may be concerning this singular personage,&#xD;
who has a marvellous power of ubiquity, cer-&#xD;
tainly," Brion added.&#xD;
Mignon paused to rally her thoughts.&#xD;
" Hitherto," she answered, "my conceptions&#xD;
of him have been quite, untinged with romance,&#xD;
and practical to the last degree. I pictured him,&#xD;
brave Brion, a wily savage gifted with a power&#xD;
of cunning remarkable, even for his race, and&#xD;
actuated by thpstrongest. feelings of vindictive-&#xD;
ness. Fired with undying enmity, strengthened&#xD;
with unnatural hate, endowed with dauntless&#xD;
oo r ge, and aided by that fo-like cunning, he&#xD;
has been able to cover his movements with-mys-&#xD;
tery,,and make his name a word of terror."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Those were your former views ; now your&#xD;
present opinion, if you please?" ,&#xD;
" My thoughts at this moment are so unlike&#xD;
what they were, that I shall doubtless excite a&#xD;
smile upon your lips,-Captain Brion. Redpath&#xD;
is more like the eagle than the raven."&#xD;
Brion's eyes rested upon. the figure of the&#xD;
raven upon Mignon's breast at that moment, and&#xD;
he said with a smile:&#xD;
" But you-give the preference to the raven, it-&#xD;
would seem?"&#xD;
Mignon's cheeks assumed a deeper red.&#xD;
",Yes, I wear the raven, but' I shall attempt&#xD;
to impose on my imagination and think it an&#xD;
eagle," she replied. " Redpathh as I said, is&#xD;
more like the eagle than the raven. He has eyes&#xD;
that are bold and piercing, that dare the sun to&#xD;
dazzlethem. He has a front like the god of war.&#xD;
His features are noble, his manners lofty and'&#xD;
proud. Redpath is tall and stately as the cedars&#xD;
of Lebanon. With' other men he is like Saul&#xD;
among the prophets. His tread is firm and fear-&#xD;
less. He speaks but little, and his words are&#xD;
commands. He reads the destiny of the red man;&#xD;
he sees the coming supremacy of the ;white, and&#xD;
the destiny of the Indian.. He'  knows that the-&#xD;
way of his people is over the mountains and to-&#xD;
ward the sea-and toward oblivion. The thought&#xD;
of the extinction of a great nation like his,&#xD;
through the injustice of the palefaces, maddens&#xD;
him ; his noble soul swells with emotions inex-&#xD;
pressible, and he invokes the vengeance of the&#xD;
great and awful Master of Life."&#xD;
While Mignon was thus describing Redpat,&#xD;
she stopped near a swamp of inusquite, and Brion&#xD;
dismounted to adjust her saddle-girth.,&#xD;
" Did you not bear a Sound ?" he asked, turn-&#xD;
ing toward the musquite.  -&#xD;
Mignon was already looking in that direction ;&#xD;
she replied with some embarrassment : "A slight&#xD;
disturbance among the leaves, occasioned  I&#xD;
imagine, by yonder prairie-dog, which our voices&#xD;
frightened from his shelter." But Mignon, in&#xD;
this instance, was not quite ingenuous ; she had ,&#xD;
seen, while Brion was employed with the girth,&#xD;
and at the instant she' was finishing her descrip-&#xD;
tion, the tall form of Ravenclaw. He stood in&#xD;
the musquite in an attentive attitude, as if listen.&#xD;
ing to the tones of her voice. . He cast upon her&#xD;
a look of mingled melancholy and pride, and&#xD;
she saw him no more.&#xD;
"Ah," quoth Brion,' rather drily, "you make&#xD;
a hero of Redpath."&#xD;
"But what can you expect, my friend, from a&#xD;
&#xD;
REDPATH.&#xD;
&#xD;
giddy girl who owes her life to this same per-&#xD;
sonage2"&#xD;
"0,' thought the partisan, "it should {have&#xD;
been I who saved this charming woman !"&#xD;
"You have painted him with the colors of&#xD;
the novelist; but I will not cavil, inasmuch as&#xD;
he deserves unmeasured commendation for what&#xD;
he has done. Redpath nrthis has done me a&#xD;
good service, also," Brion answered.&#xD;
In what manner has he been of service to&#xD;
you, Captain -Brion ?.                -&#xD;
"Had you suffered the fate intended for you,&#xD;
I should never cease to reproach myself," said&#xD;
the mountaineer.&#xD;
"And why ."&#xD;
"For t'he simple reason that I did not care&#xD;
for you better after you put yourself under my&#xD;
protection ; it was in me, criminal neglect, for&#xD;
which I most earnestly ask your pardon."&#xD;
"I.cannot absolve you from a sin whi  you&#xD;
never incurred. Please to remember that I posi-&#xD;
tively refused your escort to the camp;p therefore&#xD;
if blame there be, it necessarily falls on me.&#xD;
"I see well where my error was, and even&#xD;
your ingenuous kindness cannot make me for-&#xD;
get 't. From  this hour it shall 'be my special&#xD;
preIogative to attend to your safety; it shall be&#xD;
the first, the greatest, the last of my duties so&#xD;
long as you shall think proper to honor me with&#xD;
your presence and confidence."&#xD;
"Thanks-thanks I You will well discharge&#xD;
the self-imposed. duty ; but let me'entreat you&#xD;
not to neglect more important matters for the&#xD;
sake of a truant maiden, whose erratic wander-&#xD;
ings expose her to the charge   of female&#xD;
quixotism."&#xD;
"Chastisement to him   who has the pre-&#xD;
sumption to make that or any other charge of a&#xD;
reproachful character 1" exclaimed Brion, with a&#xD;
menacing motion of the hand. "He who couples&#xD;
your'name with aught that is unbecoming, shall&#xD;
feel the anger of Ben Brion !"&#xD;
"And that," said Buckeye, who now joined&#xD;
the parties, "is no slight thing, accordin' to mny&#xD;
views of human natur."&#xD;
"I trust my humble name wl not give rise&#xD;
to aught'unpleasant," said Mignon, with heigh-&#xD;
tened color.&#xD;
"~Your name, miss," quoth -3uckeye, "shall&#xD;
be the watchword of the camp. By the beard of&#xD;
Joe Smith I them as hasn't no particular religion&#xD;
'miong us, shall prayto you !"&#xD;
"I fear I shall prove a poor, dumb divinity,"&#xD;
returned Mignon, laughing.'&#xD;
&#xD;
'65&#xD;
&#xD;
"I sha'n't put up my petitions to nobody&#xD;
else I" rejoined Buckeye. "When I feel like&#xD;
worshippin', 'I want somethin' I can see."&#xD;
" You are a materialist," said Brion.&#xD;
"I should be a-good Christian, I reckon, if I&#xD;
allers had somethin' lovely in the woman-line&#xD;
'bout- me; it softens the rough side of my na-&#xD;
tur---the nor'west, mountainous side which has&#xD;
allers been uncultivatedd and neglected."&#xD;
"'Will you be good enough, Buckeye, to re-&#xD;
peat me one of the prayers you intend to make&#xD;
use of"" requested the mountaineer.&#xD;
" Well, cap'n,.it would be oncommon like the&#xD;
one I beard you sayin' in your sleep, not'long&#xD;
ago,        '}&#xD;
" You, are talking at _random !" protested&#xD;
Brion, palpably disconcerted.&#xD;
. "There's two things I never do-I mean talk&#xD;
at random or shoot at random. But as to the&#xD;
prayer, it should 'commence somewhat in this&#xD;
fashion. '0, Mignon, a rude old sinner entreats&#xD;
you never to leave him, that there may be some-&#xD;
thin' lovely and good allers near to apologize for&#xD;
the rest of human natur."'&#xD;
S" Not so bad," said Brion.&#xD;
" Come, sir, desist I" interposed the divinity&#xD;
of this prayer. Then to Buckeye: "I trust that&#xD;
you mean me well, and intend no disrespect.",&#xD;
"If I mean you any otherwise than well, may&#xD;
I be-scalped !" cried Buckeye, bluntly.&#xD;
" I can vouch for his goodness of heart, Miss&#xD;
Bellmar.- He has given himself not a moment's&#xD;
rest since your disappearance, and looked for the&#xD;
trail of your captors as earnestly as if you had&#xD;
been his own child."&#xD;
"There's a heap of malice in ye, cap's'! I&#xD;
aint old enough to be the girl's father, no ways,&#xD;
and the innooendo isn't altogether friendly," .-&#xD;
plied the trappers gravely.&#xD;
" 0, I am - sure you are not old I" added&#xD;
Mignon.&#xD;
"'Sartinly not. Here's Flash; I'll leave it to&#xD;
Flash ; and Flash has known mis longer 'n any&#xD;
of ye. Come, Flash, what do you say ?"&#xD;
"It's well for you, he can't speak," said 'the&#xD;
partisan, good-humoredly. "A strange, tale he'd&#xD;
be telling !"  -&#xD;
" Do you hear him, miss I He's afeard I hall&#xD;
become a favorite with you, as I shall, if I Ave&#xD;
long enough."&#xD;
"I have 'you in much favor, now,". repled&#xD;
Miss -Bollmary playfully.&#xD;
In pleasant conversation the parties beguiled&#xD;
the tedium of the returning trail. .By the .mid-&#xD;

&#xD;
die of the afternoon they were within a few miles&#xD;
of the canon.&#xD;
Life seemed more precious to Mignon than at&#xD;
any previous period of her existence. -The sun,&#xD;
the skies, the earth presented new attractions and&#xD;
beauties hitherto unappreciated., She marvelled&#xD;
that she had ever beheld them with feelings of&#xD;
indifference. "Glorious world !" -she mentally&#xD;
exclaimed, "I shall not yet leave thee. " shall&#xD;
dwell with and in-thee, and experience formany&#xD;
years, perchance, the'munificence of provident&#xD;
nature."&#xD;
Hearing words of salutation from Buckeye,&#xD;
she looked up and perceived that two persons&#xD;
on horseback had joined the party.&#xD;
'  "Ah," said Brion, who kept his place at her&#xD;
side, " here is an addition to our numbers."&#xD;
"And you will do well to be -on your guard.&#xD;
Ohe of those .approaching is the specialinstru-&#xD;
sment of; Mariot-a half-breed, whose name is&#xD;
,Gardette, generally known, I believe, by his In-&#xD;
dian name of Beavertaker; while the other is no&#xD;

"I know them, mademoiselle. 'That provi-&#xD;
deuce which reaches to the wilderness, and be-&#xD;
yond those mighty mountains even, has made&#xD;
me acquainted with those now advancing," re&#xD;
turned the mountaineer.&#xD;
"6Whatever may be the nature and design of&#xD;
their visit, I trust you will remember, captain&#xD;
that I am under your protection," Mignon added,&#xD;
with considerable agitation of manner.&#xD;
"Icertainly will not forget a, circumstanc&#xD;
affording me so much pleastire."&#xD;
VIneed not admonish you to be-firm."&#xD;
"In your cause such admonition is unnecessary&#xD;
But'sere they are."  .   ' --&#xD;
"Captain Brion, I believe ?"'said Callard, ad&#xD;
dressing the mountaineer. ,&#xD;
"I am thus called," said the latter.-&#xD;
"I think we met many years ago," resume&#xD;
the former, "tut, this precarious life of our&#xD;
changes the human face, you know4".&#xD;
"The extremes of heat and cold, hunger ani&#xD;
thirst, and hardship, all set their mark upon th&#xD;
features." Brion answered. During: tle tim&#xD;
this rejoinder, occupied, Callard was, lookin;&#xD;
furtivelyat Mignon..&#xD;
"But," added Brion, " though exposure an&#xD;
suffring may roughen the features, j trustit wi&#xD;
never change the heart of an honest.trapper."&#xD;
"No, assuredly;; at least I hope not, in you&#xD;
case," returned Callard."&#xD;
&#xD;
" I believe I have a clear conscience. I have&#xD;
tried to make it my study to act the man of&#xD;
honor. Now will you be kind enough to inform&#xD;
me to what lucky chance Iowe the honor of this&#xD;
visit 1"&#xD;
Disconcerted by the suddenness of this request;&#xD;
Callard exhibited much embarrassment.&#xD;
" That I have to, say,' Captain Brion, is pro-&#xD;
bably more proper for your private ear," he&#xD;
rejoined.&#xD;
" If there is aught in your message to make a&#xD;
lady blush, I do not wish to hear it. The young&#xD;
woman that you see near me may safely be made&#xD;
the repository of the most important secret that&#xD;
can be entrusted to human keeping."&#xD;
"But if the subject to be discussed ' concerns&#xD;
this young lady herself, you perceive that it may&#xD;
alter the ease ?"  ,&#xD;
"Nof at all ! speak what you have been cop-&#xD;
missi ed to at once and in her hearing. If it&#xD;
concerns her, why then she is the'party most in-&#xD;
terested, and has a right to-be present."&#xD;
" I will throw aside disguise at once," sid&#xD;
Callard. " This lady is Mademoiselle Bellmar,&#xD;
who left the roof of her aged father in the garb&#xD;
of a youthful adventurer, and. joined company&#xD;
with me at Fort Leavenworth. The fact of her&#xD;
sex having transpired, she clandestinely left my&#xD;
encampment."A&#xD;
f " Had she not a right to do so!"&#xD;
" Under ordinary circumstances she had an&#xD;
undoubted right to govern her own movements ;&#xD;
but this, you will readily apprehend, was a pecu-&#xD;
e liar case. It was my duty as well as my design&#xD;
to send her back to herfather under a safe escort.&#xD;
It was an unwillingness to return that unques-&#xD;
tionably induced her to withdraw from my pro-&#xD;
tection."&#xD;
"You cannot imagine that Miss Bellmar has&#xD;
not a will or purpose of her own?"&#xD;
"Certainly ; she has too much will, and as to&#xD;
d her purpose, I will not wound her delicacyby&#xD;
a referring to it."&#xD;
"Nor need you; I know it already."&#xD;
d " That she entered on this wild enterprise to be&#xD;
e near her lover, may be admitted without com-&#xD;
e promising her womanly instincts ; but there is no&#xD;
g accounting for that caprice that induced. her to&#xD;
fly from him, wien to all human appearance it&#xD;
d was quite unneedful."&#xD;
"With delicate questions of this nature, it ill&#xD;
becomes you and I.to meddle. She will herself&#xD;

matters."&#xD;

" That man means to be dangerous," remark-&#xD;
ed Buckeye.. o&#xD;
"If he suffers himseif,to be led by Mariot,&#xD;
yes," Brion replied., ti&#xD;
At that moment a man came to tell the par- o&#xD;
tisan that Balaam was overcome with sleep, fa- t&#xD;
tigue and exhaustion, and was in danger of fall- p&#xD;
ing from his horse, The mountaineer instantly f&#xD;
ordered a halt,,and the black being disposed of c&#xD;
in a comfdrtable- position, slept, heavily till s&#xD;
dark. Brion had given orders to go forward e&#xD;
again, when a firing was heard in the direction p&#xD;
of the canon. Mignon was the, first to mark p&#xD;
the sound, and looked inquiringly at the cap- &#xD;
tain. The latter was assisting her to the' sad.&#xD;
dle ; when she was seated he enjoined silence, c&#xD;
and going to a small knoll, turned his practiced c&#xD;
ear in the direction of the ominous disturbance.7&#xD;
There vas a heavy volley and then a dropping&#xD;
fire which continued. Brion- .came back in av&#xD;
few minutes.                           '&#xD;
" The Indians have attacked our camp," he]&#xD;
said. Buckeye and the whole party confirmed&#xD;
his opinion.,&#xD;
"Yes," asserted the former, "the heatheni&#xD;
riptiles are at their old tricks again. Many and&#xD;
many a time have I heard that kind of 'firing&#xD;
when the oncivilized buffalo-eaters were astir.&#xD;
They'll never be content and mind their busi-&#xD;
ness as long's there's a hoss to steal, or a white&#xD;
trapper's camp to plunder. I allers go in for a&#xD;

in that war. Flash is great in a rmnnin' fight,i&#xD;
but not quite sel handy in -a reg'lar bush tussle,&#xD;
where the red niggers skulk from tree to tree."&#xD;
Balaam approached much refreshed, singing&#xD;
about a venerable relative "who had no -wool&#xD;
on the top of his head, in the place where the&#xD;
wool ought to grow."  '&#xD;
- 'That's a game cretur," continued Buckeye.&#xD;
" Nothing' seems to break him down, though&#xD;
one might nat'rally think that the loss of his&#xD;
night-cap is a solemcholly' affair, calkillated -to&#xD;
check  s happy flow of sperits."&#xD;
" Go on in dat strain, Buffaloeye," quoth Ba-&#xD;
laatn, with an exhibition of ivory.&#xD;
"You hear that firing , 'don't ye, Bill-em'&#xD;
Well, the Ingins have come back arter the rest&#xD;
of your scalp," said Buckeye, in a' bantering&#xD;
tomO&#xD;
&#xD;
" Go 'long, Bullseye ! don't spose yer limited&#xD;
ldication!" retorted Balsam.&#xD;
" The firing continues and grows more spirit-&#xD;
d," sai the partisan.'&#xD;
"Ho* are we to reach the camp ?" 'inquired&#xD;
ne of the trappers.&#xD;
" That is yet to be determined, and an under&#xD;
king which may be attended with danger. If&#xD;
ur friends are.surrounded by Blackfeet, it cer-&#xD;
ainly'will not be easy to get to them. It is&#xD;
possible, however, that the attack may be con-&#xD;
ined to one side, in which case we can join our&#xD;
omrades without much difficulty.   The real&#xD;
tate of affairs must be learned by one experi-&#xD;
need iid woodcraft, while the rest remain at a&#xD;
prudent distance until the thing is settled. If&#xD;
racticable, we will go to the camp, if not, we&#xD;
must be governed by circumstances."-&#xD;
" That's advised like an old mountaineer,&#xD;
eap'n,", said Buckeye. "A better arrangement&#xD;
wouldn't be made, considerin' the circumstances.&#xD;
There bein' a woman with us, that woman&#xD;
must be pertected, cost what it may. If there&#xD;
was none but masculines 'mong us, why we&#xD;
might cut our way to camp through a host of yaller&#xD;
Ingins ; but as I have said, it isn't so ; there's&#xD;
one here that must be defended to the last."&#xD;
"We will proceed to the timber yonder, which&#xD;
is near the canon, where I will leave you in&#xD;
charge of the Cnen for the protection of Made-&#xD;
moiselle Bellmar,, while I reconnoitre the condi-&#xD;
tion of the camp. -Judging by the continuous&#xD;
fire, there is a determined conflict going on, with&#xD;
the advantage of numbers on the side'of the&#xD;
enemy."&#xD;
The partisan, w ing given other premonitory&#xD;
instructions, set forward on foot for the scene&#xD;
of the fight, while. his little band of trappers,&#xD;
with Mignon, took shelter in the timber.&#xD;
Brion approached the canon by the most ob-&#xD;
scure way, covered by- pinon and cottonwood.&#xD;
He pushed warily on until he was able to com-&#xD;
mand a tolerably good vievr of the spot ; or&#xD;
more properly a position where in broad daylight&#xD;
he could have looked along its entire length';&#xD;
but darkness now hung over the cliffs, relieved&#xD;
lyy the flashes of fire-arms only, as the Indians&#xD;
fired down from their hiding places at the trap-&#xD;
pers below, and the latter replied by the sharp&#xD;
crack of theirrifles. The mountaineer perceived&#xD;
that the attacking party was large, for the sides&#xD;
of the canon were occupied in every accuisible&#xD;
place, a blaze leaping from  every projecting&#xD;
ledge and rock, frpm every cleft and hole.&#xD;
&#xD;
Entering the canon, Brion made such a dispo-  'cI think.you.will hayt  is      o&#xD;

"Before you:say  iore, let me ask why are'&#xD;

"To acknowledge frankly, captain, 'that I&#xD;

"Some of them'have joined another band o&#xD;

"And the gold-seeking expedition-"'&#xD;

Brion mused a moment.Y&#xD;
" Mr. Headley,' he, added, " if I had any&#xD;
means of testing your sincerity, youi apologies'&#xD;
should 'be acceited."&#xD;
" Try me," said Headley, "and if youfind one&#xD;

then you shall' b at. liberty to doubt my sin,&#xD;
cerity. My original agreement, I am aware, is&#xD;
forfeited, and I do not ask to be fully reinstated,&#xD;
but merely to, be tolerated among you; more I&#xD;

"My nature, sir, is a frank, unsuspecting one.&#xD;
You'recollect the old adage, ' To err is human,'&#xD;
etc. I am disposed to overlook your fault, and&#xD;
restore you once more to yon- place, and I trust&#xD;
my confidence will-not be abused.",&#xD;
The parties were ataiding near Mignon's tent,&#xD;
and at that juncture;that young lady appeared:&#xD;
iteadley, .who "saw Mignon advancing, exhib-&#xD;
ited considerable-surprise, filing his eyes so h&#xD;
tently upon he,.thatseheeouldnot -but'be aware&#xD;
of biclose scrutiny.' Her beautyduseled the&#xD;
unstable Missourian. Head expected -t6' se&#xD;
&#xD;
a masculine young-woman, possessed ofno-more&#xD;
charms than Don Quixete's Dulciaca;, there&#xD;
fore the loveliness;of Mignon was a revelation&#xD;
so unexpected,, that he could do .nothing but&#xD;
stare at the fair apparition, as if quite bewildered.&#xD;
He could now father Mariot's motives, so far&#xD;
as this attractive divinity was concerned. He&#xD;
desired to secure her person, not so much for&#xD;
humanity's sake, as for his own ; for it seemed&#xD;
to Headley .impossible that one who had once&#xD;
seen Mignon should not love her.&#xD;
as ye passed on, revealing to. Headley the&#xD;
felicity of Brion, and the calm trust of Mignon.&#xD;
.He was maddened at the successes of one toward&#xD;
whom he had never felt any friendship, and one,'&#xD;
too, that his conscience assured-him was much&#xD;
his superior in moral attributes and sterling&#xD;
qualities. He saw them walk together, and the&#xD;
sight was hateful tohim; he 'heard them speak-&#xD;
ing- in low and confidential tones, and the sounds&#xD;
were torture to his ears.&#xD;
The partisan, absorbed in the presence of Mig-&#xD;
non, grew daily se observant of Headley, till-his'&#xD;
movements were entirely unwatched by him. It&#xD;
was then that the Missourian began to take walks&#xD;
by himself, which daily grew longer and extended&#xD;
farther from thecamp, As he returned regular-&#xD;
ly, and deported himself well, no suspicion was&#xD;
excited so far as Brion was concerned.&#xD;
Ong circumstance annoyed the Missourian;,&#xD;
he was. satisfied that Buckeye had followed him&#xD;
on, more than one occasion, which was a species&#xD;
of espionage threatening to prove fatal to his&#xD;
plas. After many: attempts he ,uceeeded in&#xD;
eluding, he believed, the vigilance of the trapper..&#xD;
The hour was: between sunset and dark. By a&#xD;
circuitous route he reached the art of timber,&#xD;
near which the steel arrow had been so singuierly&#xD;
projected by an: unseen bowman,.and into the&#xD;
tree upon which'the, figure, of ,a man had been&#xD;
Carved with the point of a knife., 4 person ad-i&#xD;
vanced-from the timhenand met him, it was,the&#xD;
hal&amp;amp;breed. .,Together they passed into the:ob-&#xD;
scrity of the wood, and conferredearnestly for'&#xD;
along ti*ewhenHedlley hurried back to the,&#xD;
canon. At eleven o'clock, when the partisan&#xD;
walked throughthe encampment,, according to&#xD;
,hisiabit, everything was as usual1;and Ve:went&#xD;
to sleep with the onsiousness that all was safe.&#xD;
hen he visitedMignon's tent in the moving,&#xD;
she was not there. While wondering at thecir-.&#xD;
cutance, Buckeye came t9 inform himthat,&#xD;
several of the horseIbad been stolen during the&#xD;
nighi Mignen's, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Where is Headley?" asked Brien.&#xD;
"He's nott6 be found," said Buckeye. "By&#xD;
thebheardsof mth ,!"&#xD;
t  Brien lost no time in useless repinings over&#xD;
what had happened. That he was perplexed and&#xD;
anxious will be believed, and needs no affirma-&#xD;
tion. With characteristic promptness he com-&#xD;
r minced asearch for Mignon The ground around&#xD;
the tent was thoroughly examined, but it:was not&#xD;
of a nature to leave a trail; there was a rocky&#xD;
ridge extending a mile or two from the anon,&#xD;
upon which the foot of ranor horse could make&#xD;
no impression. Thougir sharp-sighted and en-&#xD;
perienced, the partisan was unable to determine&#xD;
the,ceurse of the missing maiden. YUnder these&#xD;
circumstances, he mounted his horse to make a&#xD;
monre general investigation., Buckeye, like a&#xD;
faithful friend, attended the !captain, as much in-&#xD;
terested in the search, apparently as he.&#xD;
"Ialways Mistrustedthe cretr'," quoth the&#xD;
trapper, alluding to Headley, "and you remem-&#xD;
ber, perhaps, that I advised yourto have nothing&#xD;
to, do. with him, notwithstanding' his penitence&#xD;
like."&#xD;
"Ypour suspicions were at;inst shared by me ;&#xD;
but his correct deportmnent afterward restored&#xD;
my confidence," returned the mtbuntaineer.&#xD;
"I'm not blamin' ye for hein' .charitable, as&#xD;
'twere, because charity is what we aulneed more&#xD;
or less. I ought to recollect, too that yournmind&#xD;
was much taken up with _that uncommon&#xD;
woman."&#xD;
The partisan's manly:face was suffused for a&#xD;
moment, and he answered,:&#xD;
"It is possible that , have been selfish in my&#xD;
happiness ; and upon reflection1I aminclined to&#xD;
think it is so."&#xD;
"No apologies, .cap'n;inslch a case it Isn't&#xD;
in human natur to be otherwise. She's the put-&#xD;
tiest woman alive, and interestin' to natch. As&#xD;
old as I am--andl'm a littlee up'ardasof forty'-.&#xD;
I'm almost fool enough tolove-her myself."&#xD;
" What pleasure it giyeo sne todiea you speak&#xD;
so kindly of her !" said Brion,warmly.&#xD;
," Who could speak otherwise' ,,here'eno-&#xD;

" You forget, that -she may be lost to -me for&#xD;

They rode on in silencejexamining closely all&#xD;
the route for miles. Justat sunset Brond struck&#xD;
a fresh 'trail leading -to the water, and both he&#xD;

It was now too dark tofollowthe trail with cer-&#xD;
tainty,'and'they encamped for test and refresh-&#xD;

Buckeye'to be asleep,'and passed out of the tent&#xD;
acid started anewin' searchof the traill: He went&#xD;
onurtil he cares to a hill which he climbed and&#xD;
passed over to'the other side. At its base' was&#xD;
an impassable chapparal, and he turned aside to&#xD;
&#xD;
the'south. He soon came to a def surrounded&#xD;
by-red cedatand pines, where he found the re.&#xD;
mains of a fire still smoking:&#xD;
While Brion stood reflecting whether to con-&#xD;
tinue his solitary reconnoisance or return to&#xD;
Buckeye, he was startled by a low and trium-&#xD;
phant laugh near him. Raising his eyes and&#xD;
partially turning round, Brion beheld a specta-&#xD;
cle which sent the blood thrilling through his&#xD;
veins with unwonted rapidity; he was surround-&#xD;
ed by stalwort warriors whose dusky features&#xD;
looked grim and terrible in the darkness. In&#xD;
advance of the rest, and scarcely three yards&#xD;
from the jnountaineer, stood one whose dress'&#xD;
and bearing indicated him to be a chief,&#xD;
"And so the cunning Fox has come to the&#xD;
hunter ?" said he, repeating the laugh that had&#xD;
so electrified the partisan. " Has the Fox be-&#xD;
come a fool that he thrusts his Paw into the&#xD;
trap I"&#xD;
" The most Bunning are not.alwaysupon their&#xD;
guard, and an old squaw may sometimes surprise&#xD;
the panther sleeping on a tree," said Brion.&#xD;
"I trapped you once before, but the heart of,&#xD;
Ravenclaw was soft. The eyes of Lilyface turn-&#xD;
ed his blood to water. Wily trapper, you will,&#xD;
not live to see the next new moon. Last year,&#xD;
Prairiewolf scented you upon Snake River, when&#xD;
you were catching the beaver, but hecould not&#xD;
catch yon; now he has got his hand on you, and&#xD;
you cannot escape. What have you to say ?"&#xD;
"That I will give you much for liberty," re-&#xD;
sponded Brion.&#xD;
" Do you give liberty to the otter when you&#xD;
have taken it'? Do you spare the buffalo when&#xD;
you are.hungering for his flesh I Do you say&#xD;
to the panther, go in peace, when you have&#xD;
levelled your rifle at her heart ? Fox, you have&#xD;
lost your cunning 1".&#xD;
"I have gunS and ammunition, hatchets and&#xD;
hunting-knives, beads, bells and mirrors, and&#xD;
strong horses," replied the trapper.&#xD;
"It-is not so; you have nothing ; not even&#xD;
life. Listen, we have a vow to- kill the first&#xD;
living thing that cae e among us. White man,&#xD;
'such vows are never broken."&#xD;
"I, have heard of such a custom prevailing&#xD;
among your people ; but it is a cruel and use-&#xD;
less one. If I:must be sacrificed, it will make&#xD;
but little difference whether I die to-night - or&#xD;
three days hence ; therefore giveme three days&#xD;
liberty, and at the expiration of that time I&#xD;
will return,- when you can fulfil your vow.",&#xD;
" Wa-wa ! I was right when I said the: ox&#xD;
&#xD;
was growing 'foolish; he is getting into his&#xD;
dotage.".               -&#xD;
"I swear by the Great Spirit; that I will re-&#xD;
turn and surrender myself a prisoner, to 'suffer&#xD;
the death you hive determined upon!" added&#xD;
Brion, with emphasis.&#xD;
" Paleface, that cannot beF! Even if you&#xD;
came back, Ravenclaw might again give you&#xD;
life ; but LX will not trust you; your heart)is not&#xD;
big enough to keep your word. If you come,&#xD;
it would 'be with your. hunters at your heels,&#xD;
with their rifles cocked andat their faces. Prai-&#xD;
riewolf is not a child that he should be deceived&#xD;
by words which are as smoke curling' from the&#xD;
top of a wigwam, to pass away into the air and&#xD;
be remembered no more."&#xD;
The partisan felt a cold; sickly sensation creep-&#xD;
ing over him, his blood seemed to flow back upon&#xD;
his heart with horror ; he experienced dn-instinc-&#xD;
tive shrinkingthat reached to his Wry marrow.&#xD;
Prairiewolf eyed him, a mocking smile on hislips.&#xD;
" Prairiewolf, when the Master of Life calls&#xD;
for us, we must-go ; but the whiteimaa has dif-&#xD;
ferent notions from the savage. His flesh is&#xD;
more sensitive to the fire than the red man's, be-&#xD;
cause he has never been taught to despiseits tor-&#xD;
tures. If nothing but my death will suffice,&#xD;
strike your knife into my breast and let nme-pass&#xD;
at once to the hunting-grounds."&#xD;
"A squaw might die in that way ; a great chief&#xD;
like you deserves a inore honorable death."&#xD;
A brave approached, to bind Brion's hands.&#xD;
Resolved to secure a sudden death or escape,&#xD;
with his hatchet he struck the savage -down at&#xD;
Prairiewolf's feet, and bounded from  the dell&#xD;
with the speed of a deer ' But there were those&#xD;
after him swift of foot andftireless- in pursuit;&#xD;
and having scarcely three jards the start of his&#xD;
pursuers, themountaiseer could hardly hope for&#xD;
success. He was overtaken, carried back, and&#xD;
bound in a'mnsnuer to preclude the possibility of&#xD;
a second attempts&#xD;
"You are not quick,; enough:!"- said Prairie-&#xD;
wolf, tauntingly. '"A boy could run faster."&#xD;
"But, a boy could not do, that I" retorted&#xD;
Brion, pointing to the body of the bravewhom&#xD;
he had stricken.&#xD;
" We shall see," resumed Prairiewolf, fiercely,&#xD;
"how you will bear up under the ordealof the&#xD;
twelve fires !"&#xD;
" The will of God -be done!i"' replied Brion,&#xD;
commending himselfto that Being who is apt to&#xD;
be forgotten in prosperity, and remembered only,&#xD;
in adversity.-&#xD;

Thethief obeyed,: not certain that the words&#xD;

agitation.&#xD;
" Beavers and otters I- it's an arrow I" -ex-.&#xD;

much terrified to speak.&#xD;

"If that's the case, then free your conscience&#xD;

"There is one thing I regret," added the half-&#xD;

" That's right; I'm glad to hear ye say so; it&#xD;
makes half-breed human natur appear to better&#xD;
advantage. Tell me what it is that-you're sorry&#xD;
fort"&#xD;
" I will; it is that I sold myself to Pierre&#xD;
Mai-lot."&#xD;
"And well you may, for he is a villain. 'As&#xD;
it can't now make any difference to you, either&#xD;
in regard to your pay or futur prospects, inform&#xD;

"At first his object was to destroy the trap.&#xD;
pers of the American Fur Company."&#xD;
"That I 'have - found out already," said the&#xD;
trapper.&#xD;
" When Mignon appeared," resumed Beaver-&#xD;
taker, " and went over to Brion's party, it then&#xD;
became hi great object to obtain possession of&#xD;
her person, and by a series of-persecutions, over-&#xD;
come her objections to his wishes."&#xD;
"And what might his wishes:be t"&#xD;
"To make her Madame Mariot, of course.".&#xD;
"(I have yet another question to ask."&#xD;
"Ask it."&#xD;
" Can you tell me where Mademoiselle Bell-&#xD;
mar is now l"&#xD;
"She is, travelling-toward the flails as fast&#xD;
as fleet horses can carry her. She is with Ma-&#xD;
riot, andwHeadley was his instirennt. But the&#xD;
end is not yet; Headley loves her, and there&#xD;
-will be a struggle between the two." -&#xD;
"Beard of Smith i Jestwhatithought!' Put&#xD;
two scoundrels'together to serve the devil, and&#xD;
directly they'll go to cuttin' each other's throats.&#xD;
What trail- is that the cap'n and I have been&#xD;
following' ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"That of a small party'of Blackfeet who have&#xD;
sworn never to 'return to theirvillage without a&#xD;
prisoner"&#xD;
"Ah, that gives me an idea-, Depend on't,&#xD;
the cap'n's in trouble. It's probable that the&#xD;
thought of Mignon kept him awake, ahd he got&#xD;
up and.,followed this trail, and has been taken&#xD;
by this war party. By Joe's Smith's beard!- I&#xD;
must be after him."&#xD;
"Madman, stop!' you will but go to share his'&#xD;
fate !"-&#xD;
" Share his fate? I'm willin' to-I'm *illin'&#xD;
to, if I can't save him. What is fire to a true'&#xD;
soul ? It's nothin'! All the fire in the world&#xD;
can't burn up the mortal principle of an hon-&#xD;
est man !" -said Buckeye, with fervor&#xD;
"Follow your destiny, and I will mine. Time&#xD;
is passing, and to meit is the same as life. But&#xD;
I turn my back upon these familiar scenes with&#xD;
sorrow ; I love the prairies and the wide skies&#xD;
over them; the mountains have become dear to&#xD;
me, and I love to hunt the buffalo upon the great&#xD;
hunting-grounds of the red man. I go, and we&#xD;
shall 'never meet again. Honest trapper, fare-&#xD;
well !" Beavertaker said no more, but turning&#xD;
away, was soon out of sight.&#xD;
"The kentry's relieved," said the trapper ;&#xD;
" it'll breathe easier, feel better, and stan' longer,&#xD;
I dare say. It can't be' said'that Redpath hasn't&#xD;
done some good, previdin' he's had a hand in&#xD;
the matter ; for one, I'm obleged to him, be he&#xD;
man or demon. But I musn't forgit for an in-&#xD;
stant that-the cap'n's in danger. I'll hop on to.&#xD;
Flash and it shall go hard with me if I don't&#xD;
find him. Flash can scent an Ingin as- far as a&#xD;
dog can his master."&#xD;
Buckeye hastily saddled his horse, and leav-&#xD;
ing Brion's animal to shift for himself, was soon&#xD;
in motion.  With his nose near the ground&#xD;
Flash followed the trail of the mountaineer.&#xD;
When Flash had gone on in this manner for&#xD;
a half or three quarters of an hour, he stopped,&#xD;
snuffed the air, and shook his head.&#xD;
" He smells the greturs " said Buckeye,;,&#xD;
"they're near-I never =new him to fail." 'He&#xD;
dismounted and stood a moment beside his&#xD;
horse.&#xD;
"Flash," said he; gently, stroking the crea-&#xD;
ture's neck with his hand, " we've been friends a&#xD;
great;while, and it wouldn't be like ye to desert&#xD;
me now. 'Stay here and be as still as death.&#xD;
If I don't see ye agin;,but go under, the same as'&#xD;
a good many better men have, don't never let&#xD;
an Ingin riptile swing his leg across your back."&#xD;
&#xD;
Stooping.until his figure presented but half its&#xD;
usual attitude, the .trapper glided onward.end&#xD;
soon reached the dell, where active preparations&#xD;
were being made for the death of the prsonea.&#xD;
The savages had already fixed twelve green&#xD;
stakes in the ground and werp gathering heaps&#xD;
of fagot4.. To Buckeyethis was a .urnful&#xD;
spectacle;. he gazed from his place of conceg-&#xD;
ment with mingled feelings of horror and indig-&#xD;
nation. He felt himself in a' dreadful dgemma;&#xD;
he could witness the agonies of his friend with&#xD;
but little chance of aiding him, or he could fly&#xD;
for assistance back to the canon with the terrible&#xD;
fear following him at every step: that he might&#xD;
be too late to save his life, Thus he remained.&#xD;
Knowing that it would be rash to undertake any-&#xD;
thing in favor ofBrion against such numbers, he&#xD;
concluded to go for assistance, hoping, by diat&#xD;
of hard riding, to, return .in season to save the&#xD;
captain's life. Creeping back, he mounted Flash&#xD;
and rode away as fast as his fleet limbs could&#xD;
carry him.&#xD;
, Meantime, the partisan was lying upon the&#xD;
ground in the- most painful position. He saw&#xD;
the green stakes driven, fagots brought, dry pine&#xD;
splinters prepared, and various other arrange-&#xD;
ments' calculated to shake the sternest resolution.&#xD;
He had abandoned himself to his fate with a kind&#xD;
of despairing apathy, when -sudden recollection&#xD;
like a gleam of .light flashed through his mind.&#xD;
" Prairiewolf," said he, "it is not the will of&#xD;
the Great Spirit that I should die now."&#xD;
"White men talk often of the Great Spirit,&#xD;
replied the chief, ironically. , "Why do you&#xD;
think he has not called you, and that you shall&#xD;
live longer upon the earth 2"&#xD;
" Unbutton my hunting frock, and you will&#xD;
find that beneath it which will answer your&#xD;
question."&#xD;
Bending over Brion, he tore open his frock,&#xD;
and there was revealed to his wondering ight&#xD;
the figure of a raven wrought in beads. . Prairie-&#xD;
wolf stood silent and confounded; rage and die-&#xD;
appointment were pictured upon his visage.&#xD;
"Accursed Fox !" .he exclaimed. "Some of&#xD;
your.cunning ydt remains. This is indeed a&#xD;
mighty medicine. I will show.itto my warriors,&#xD;
and hear what they say."&#xD;
Prairiewolf took the talisman, and going away&#xD;
a little distance, called his 'braves ,around him,&#xD;
when considerable talking followed in low toned.&#xD;
Presently the chief returned, and giving the&#xD;
mountaineer the memento that-seemed to possess&#xD;
such power, said:&#xD;

"You were right,;paleface ; your time has not&#xD;
come ; youn'ay yet live many moons to trap the&#xD;
otter and the beaver. , See ! I cut tour bands;&#xD;
rise up ; you are free !"&#xD;
The mountaineer sprang lightly to his feet,&#xD;
and the fear of a painfuldeath rolled back from&#xD;
his soul, Ie stretched out his arms-heshook&#xD;
himself like-an impatient steed-a sense of free-&#xD;
dom made him happy.&#xD;
"'Tis the providence of God 3" he exclaimed.&#xD;
"Yes," said Prairiewolf, "it is a great thing&#xD;
that has happened. There is your ways-go !&#xD;
But'remember that you shall yet feel the claws&#xD;
ofPrairiewolf!3"-, .&#xD;
"To thank you for -my life, would be giving&#xD;
you too much credit for humanity; I shall there-&#xD;
fore reserve my gratitude for one more powerful&#xD;
than thou. Adieu, unfriendly red man 1"&#xD;
A brave advanced and handed Brion his rife ;&#xD;
throwing the weapon upon his shoulder, he&#xD;
walked from the camp of his enemies with a firm&#xD;
and dignified step.&#xD;
Brion took the way he had come, and as he&#xD;
increased the distance between himself and the&#xD;
savages, quickened his pace.&#xD;
"Wabuma !" said a voice  near the moun-&#xD;
taineer, at the-moment when he was passing the&#xD;
chapparal adverted to in another place. The&#xD;
partisan cocked his rifle and looked for the&#xD;
speaker, who immediately emerged from the&#xD;
meaquit at his left.,&#xD;
"1What is your purpose ?" questioned Brion,&#xD;
presenting his rifle.&#xD;
" To pay a debt I owe you!"&#xD;
"I know you not," added the captain.&#xD;
'I Yan-kee, Iam Blackbird, son of the Raven,"&#xD;
rejoined the Indian. ,      ~.,&#xD;
The partisan eased the hammer of his rifle-&#xD;
lock softly back upon the unbroken cap, and&#xD;
dropped the breach of the weapon to the ground.&#xD;
"Ah ! I remember.".&#xD;
" Wabuma I attend thou ! When yonder war-&#xD;
party set out I was not ready, for I had certain&#xD;
rites to perform  necessary to ensure success; I&#xD;
overtook them this morning, after you had given&#xD;
Prairiewolf the great medicine:"&#xD;
" Go on," said Brion. I&#xD;
" Prairiewolf cut your bonds, and said, 'Arise;&#xD;
you are atliberty, arise and depart.' "I&#xD;
"Yes," added Brion, wondering       at what&#xD;
Blackbird was coning.&#xD;
"But," resumed the Indian, "he spoke do-&#xD;
ceitfully, and there was wickedness in his heart.&#xD;
Yan-kee, he has planned your death.  When&#xD;
&#xD;
you pass yonder spring, two braves will spring&#xD;
upon you and ,dispatch you with their toma-&#xD;
hawks. Prairiewolf has sent themhere for that&#xD;
purpose; they are crouching in the grass, wait-&#xD;
ing the sound of your coming."&#xD;
"Blackbird, behold how the- Great Spirit re-&#xD;
wards me for a mnerciful act !"&#xD;
"Wa-wa ! the Master of Life is just; he'never&#xD;
forgets, and his red children are like him."&#xD;
"Do you not fear the consequences of betray-&#xD;
ing this secret"?" Brion asked.&#xD;
" I would have warned you of this- if the&#xD;
twelve fires that. were to be lighted for you were&#xD;
to be my only reward for the deed. I will repay&#xD;
the debt I owe you though they thrust my flesh&#xD;
full of blazing splinters, and burn out my tongue."&#xD;
"My brother," said Brion, with increased earn-&#xD;
estness, "I regret that my people do not better&#xD;
understand your race. I would to God that&#xD;
mutual hatred might no longer exist ; thatjeal-&#xD;
ousy and bloodshed might cease forever."&#xD;
"Yan-kee, I have given life for life ; go your&#xD;
way, and remember that Blackbird did not prove&#xD;
ungrateful."&#xD;
The Indian vanished like a spirit-so quickly&#xD;
did he glide into the tangled depths of the chap-&#xD;
paral-and the partisan changing his course,&#xD;
made a detour to the right, thus avoiding the&#xD;
ambush of the wily Prairiewolf. He reached&#xD;
the spot where he had left Buckeye, found his&#xD;
horse quietly feeding, but of course saw nothing&#xD;
of the trapper or Flash.&#xD;
It was now daylight. Thinking it probable&#xD;
that Buckeye was looking for him, Brion con-&#xD;
cluded to remain in that vicinity awhile, believing&#xD;
he should be more likely to find him, in that&#xD;
way than by searching for him. He did not by&#xD;
any means intend to slumber, but having slept&#xD;
none during the night, nature proved stronger&#xD;
than his resolution, and he fell into an unquiet&#xD;
sleep, in which he dreamed of the-Blackfeet and&#xD;
Mignon. He was aroused from his somnolency&#xD;
by sounds that would not have been noticed by&#xD;
one who had not passed many years in country&#xD;
where constant watcb lness was required, but&#xD;
which proved to be produced by human feet ; for&#xD;
the first object that met the mountaineer's gaze&#xD;
was a man who was looking wistfully at his&#xD;
horse. e&#xD;
"Stranger," said Brion, "what, brings you&#xD;
here '""&#xD;
The individual, who obviously had not seen&#xD;
the partisan, now turned toward him with a start&#xD;
indicative of surprise.&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ah;" added Brion, immediately, "I think we&#xD;
have met before'"&#xD;
"Yes, and not much to my advantage," re-&#xD;
plied the man, pointing to' a wound upon his&#xD;
head.&#xD;
"You received that little memento of my good&#xD;
will at the timber near the canon," continued&#xD;
the partisan.&#xD;
"I'm pretty well aware of it !" said Kincaid.&#xD;
" This meeting, I perceive, di- opportune ; I&#xD;
have some questions to propose to you which I&#xD;
hope you will answer without prevarication.&#xD;
My first' question is, can you inform me&#xD;
where Pierre Mariot is ?"&#xD;
"I shall not answer," said Kincaid.&#xD;
" My next," resumed Brion, " is this : Is Miss'&#xD;
Bellmar with him?"     *&#xD;
"I reply to that as to the other question."&#xD;
" Villain !" exclaimed Brion.&#xD;
"If that suits you, why let it be so," replied&#xD;
the Frenchman, with a sneer.&#xD;
" You were doubtless about to appropriate my&#xD;
horse ?"&#xD;
" I supposed it to be an estray."&#xD;
"No apologies ; horse-stealing, I presume,&#xD;
could psily be reconciled to- your conscience ;&#xD;
you are not tender, I think. But as the civil&#xD;
questions I have asked remain unanswered, I&#xD;
will propose another: Tell me if you have any&#xD;
knowledge of the movements of Headley ?"&#xD;
" I have.".&#xD;
" That is well; where is he ?"&#xD;
.      " That is something I did not agree to tell,&#xD;
you.&#xD;
"A truce to this obstinacy ! I am intensely&#xD;
interested in Miss Bellmar, and the movements&#xD;
of Headley. and Mariot ; tell me where to find&#xD;
them, and I will make it worth your trouble."&#xD;
0, you will buy me?"&#xD;
"If it does not go beyond my means, yes.&#xD;
Name your price ?"&#xD;
"You spoke of buying my knowledge ; what&#xD;
will you gife ?"&#xD;
"What do you demand ?"&#xD;
" 'there is your horse ; it is a fine one; I will&#xD;
accept him as a gift, and in return for your&#xD;
kindness, tell you all I know of Mademoiselle&#xD;
Bellmar and Mariot," said Kincaid, with a cool.&#xD;
effrontery provoking to Brion,- who was loth to'&#xD;
part with an animal he valued highly.&#xD;
"It is ahard bargain you are driving with me,&#xD;
but I will compromise the matter by giving you&#xD;
the price of the animal in money or such goods&#xD;
as I have at the encampment," he answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
BEDPATH.&#xD;
&#xD;
"No,'hat will. not de; I'll have the horse, or&#xD;
it's no trade, and not a word passes my lips;&#xD;
so choose, apd that quickly, for I want to be&#xD;
off,": he said.&#xD;
"You are indeed a pitiful knave, and itstaxes&#xD;
my patience sorely to keep from laying violent&#xD;
hands upon you; nevertheless; if these are your&#xD;
easiest terms, I accept."&#xD;
" Saddle him and bring him here, and place&#xD;
the bridle rein in'my hand, that I may be sure&#xD;
there is no trickery about it."&#xD;
With a sigh of regret and something like re-&#xD;
morse, the partisan complied .with.this request.&#xD;
Kincaid took the bridle and threw it over the&#xD;
animal's neck. The horse, resenting this famil-&#xD;
iarity from a stranger, or frightened at the sud-&#xD;
denness of the act, reared and backed, Kincaid&#xD;
retiring with him, until he was several yards&#xD;
from the mountaineer, then springing with agility&#xD;
to-the saddle, gave him the rein, and struck his&#xD;
flanks with his heels. In a second he was gal-&#xD;
loping away.&#xD;
Brion drew up his. rifle with the intention of&#xD;
wounding the rascal, but it missed fire. Kincaid&#xD;
had taken off the cap while he was saddling the&#xD;
horse.&#xD;
"Put on a cap 3" shouted the Frenchman,&#xD;
looking back over his shoulder. At that instant&#xD;
the partisan saw a gleamof light passing through&#xD;
the air; Kincaid cried out like ore in mortal&#xD;
pain, and fell headlong from the horse. Brion&#xD;
hastened to him ; he found him upon the ground&#xD;
in the agonies of death:. a steel-headed arrow&#xD;
had passed through his lungs, and the glitter-&#xD;
ing point was visible near the spinal column be-&#xD;
neath the left shoulder.. He fixed his glassy&#xD;
eyes upon the mountaineer.&#xD;
" It is ended I" said he, in a husky voice.&#xD;
" I'm dying. My fears were prophetic-Red-&#xD;
path has stricken me. I wished for your horse&#xD;
to leave this accursed region-but it is useless to&#xD;
struggle with fate.  But I will confess this.&#xD;
Miss Bellmar is with Mariot and Headley;&#xD;
you will find them somewhere, on the trail to the&#xD;
city of the Great Salt Lake. Raise me up a lit-&#xD;
tle." Brion did so, supporting him with his&#xD;
willing arms.&#xD;
"When the breath has -left me, honest Brion,&#xD;
tie a heavy stone to my body and sink it in the&#xD;
waters of the Nebrasta."&#xD;
"Yes," said Brion, "I will do it."&#xD;
"That is all; it grows darker-thy portals&#xD;
are grim and horrible-but-but death-is eter-&#xD;
nal--eternal sleep !" Kincaid never spoke again.&#xD;

ready to return to the great .body of nature&#xD;

"Beard of the; irinortil Joe !". cried a well-&#xD;
known .voice, and thereupon the partisan felt&#xD;
himself hugged as if insthgembraces.of abear.&#xD;
"Beavers and otters ! guns and gunpowder 1"&#xD;
The reader will Perceive that Buckeye had&#xD;
returned.&#xD;
"'Well:ecap'n, this is what I, call sing'lar!I&#xD;
Why, I didn't much expect to see you ag'in in&#xD;

"Ispirit has notlesh and bones-as ye see me&#xD;

gladness.&#xD;
"In-course not, for in that case one.couldn't&#xD;
never spect to reach the now Jeroosalem unless&#xD;
he went up in a billoon ; for the force of gravity,&#xD;

"Why, Igiskivered ye, in course, and saw the&#xD;
riptiles drivin' green stakes into the ground to&#xD;
the number of twelve and up'ards."&#xD;
"You took the trail. 2"&#xD;
" Flash and I, yes.: I must say I found ye in&#xD;
a bad predicament. Twelve fires ! three days !&#xD;

"I perceive you are acquainted withthe whole&#xD;
affair. "&#xD;
" That mixed individoval the Ingins callDea-&#xD;
vertaker has been here }and he told me about the&#xD;
war-party and their;vow; and you bein' gone,,&#xD;
I put that and that together, and.made up my-&#xD;

"You can examine and satisfy yourself."&#xD;
"The body of a man with an arrow driven,&#xD;
through his-lungs,~the pint stickin' from the&#xD;

" True," said Brion. .&#xD;
" Beavers and otters let us hear about it."&#xD;
The 'artisan stated the circumstances of the&#xD;
case.&#xD;
"'Tis the work of Redpath 1" added Buckeye,&#xD;
&#xD;
in an undertone. " He is yeteat his old trade;&#xD;
he's near us by night and by day ; he's, never&#xD;
asleep; li.-afoot never tires; and his quiver is&#xD;
never empty."    0&#xD;
"A wily foe," returned Brion.&#xD;
"And not only wily but terrible" resumed the&#xD;
trapper.&#xD;
" Terrible to those whom he marks for de-&#xD;
struction; to others-he may be quite different."&#xD;
" It woukin'gg be strange if we should fuller&#xD;

of old age."..-                      '&#xD;
" That sounds right and proper, and arranges&#xD;
all my airthlyrnatters with the exception of my&#xD;
rifle and sich like, which you must keep in re-&#xD;
membrance of Buckeye--the free trapp  "&#xD;
"A brave soldier frequently make 's will&#xD;
while going to battle ; but let us hope that I&#xD;
shall not execute yours until I am myself a very&#xD;
old man. Now tell ine where you have been---&#xD;
to get help,,I dare say ?" &#xD;
"Yes, I started for the canon, but met one of&#xD;
your old trappers well-mounted, and, sent him&#xD;
with the news of your capture. Before noon,&#xD;
twenty-five brave fellers will behere-chaps that&#xD;
wont shrink from a skriumage.",&#xD;
"'We shall need them, possibly, for another&#xD;
purpose."  .&#xD;
" To pursue Mariot and Headley 2"&#xD;
" That is my design," said Urion. "But I&#xD;
must attend to the last wish of this poor fellow,&#xD;
which was to give him a burial in the waters of&#xD;
the Nebraska."&#xD;
The body was lifted upon Brion's horse and&#xD;
carried to the river, to the summit of a cliff over-&#xD;
hanging the water. While they were preparing&#xD;
it far its final resting-place a orsemenn was seen&#xD;
upon the opposite. bank; who, perceiving the&#xD;
mountaineers, called to them, desiring to know&#xD;
if the river, was fordable. The captain informed&#xD;
him that there was a sand-bar, reaching two-&#xD;
thirds of the distance across; b4t notwithstand-&#xD;
ing he would in some places fnd itbeyexd his&#xD;
horse'ssdepth.,&#xD;
&#xD;
The stranger attempted the passage, succeed-&#xD;
ing verywell' until within twenty yards of the&#xD;
shore, when--the horse not- being a very pow.&#xD;
erful swimmer, and the water being deep and&#xD;
swift--he was borne downward with the current&#xD;
and his life endangered. The partisan perceiv-&#xD;
ing his peril, did not hesitate to plunge in to his&#xD;
rescue, which, happily, he effected. The man&#xD;
was taken from'the water much exhausted. 'He&#xD;
proved to be'a person past middle age, very re-&#xD;
spect4 in appearance, and a Frenchman.&#xD;
s     Dieu!" exclaimed he, reviving from&#xD;
the effects .of his bath. " I am getting too old&#xD;
to travel in such a barbarous country. Ma fois !&#xD;
I should have been drowned but for your friend-'&#xD;
ly aid."&#xD;
" Then my' being, here was providential," re-&#xD;
plied Brion.&#xD;
".Evidently -so ; -thanks' be to the Divine.&#xD;
Being !" said the stiaunger, fervently.&#xD;
" We were performing a melancholy service&#xD;
when you appeared, which we will now com-&#xD;
plete. We were on the point of committing the&#xD;
mortal remains of a fellow-being to the keeping&#xD;
of this river."&#xD;
"Ing1! a sad affair to perform in this great&#xD;
solitude ; one of your companions, doubtless 1"&#xD;
" Guns and gunpowder, no !" exclaimed&#xD;
. Buckeye. " We don't associate with sich."&#xD;
"Please come this way, sir," requested Brion.&#xD;
"Diable ! he was shot with an arrow !" cried&#xD;
the Frenchman.&#xD;
, "And it was a fate he richly desarved, though&#xD;
we shouldn't judge too harshly of our feller-&#xD;
creters," said Buckeye.&#xD;
" He was a bad man, then?"&#xD;
"He hadn't no principles, whatsoever ; he&#xD;
was in the employment of Pierre Mariot, part-&#xD;
ner in the firm of Bellmar &amp;amp; Mariot of West-&#xD;
port," rejoined the trapper.&#xD;
The Frenchman seemed astounded, looking&#xD;
from Brion to Buckeye and from -Buckeye to&#xD;
Brion as if 'he could not well credit what had&#xD;
been affirmed.&#xD;
" It appears to work you up .somewhat, stran-&#xD;
Iuger; but sich a spettacle as this may nat'rally&#xD;
do so. Perhaps you've heard of Redpath and&#xD;
perhaps you haven't; but whether you have or&#xD;
haven't-and it probably don't make no great&#xD;
odds-jest look afore ye, and -you'll see a spec-&#xD;
imint-of his work,"&#xD;
"tThis is most wonderful !" said the stranger,&#xD;
trembling with excitement. "I have heard-of&#xD;
Redpath. I hope this is the only white man he&#xD;
has killed-within your knowledge ?" '&#xD;
&#xD;
"I wish it ffas, but it isn't; by no means ;&#xD;
sev'ral have felt his arrows and knocked under-&#xD;
as 'twerp."&#xD;
The Frenchman now looked attentively .a the&#xD;
partisan.&#xD;
"If I mistake not;" he said, "this is Captain&#xD;
Brion, the famous mountaineer ?"&#xD;
"My "name is Brion," replied the captain,&#xD;
modestly,-"but I believe I am not very famous."&#xD;
" Thanks to the intercession of the saints !&#xD;
this is well. Perhaps you can tell me something&#xD;
concerning my daughter, Mignon ?" said the&#xD;
Frenchman, hurriedly.&#xD;
"Otters! aree you the old gentleman'!" ex-&#xD;
claimed Buckeye. "Well, I may say the cap'a&#xD;
has behavedrealhandsome toward the gal. He'&#xD;
been the same as a father to her, and brother,&#xD;
too, for that matter, with a little sister thrown in.&#xD;
Bless you, sir, he's run allsorts of risk I twelve&#xD;
fires-three days--roastin'-pine splinters, and&#xD;
so on."&#xD;
"For which he will accept a father's gratitude.&#xD;
Lead me to her at once."&#xD;
" I'm not much in the habit of advisin' peo-&#xD;
ple older nor myself, but if I might be allowed&#xD;
to speak in a case like this, I should say keep&#xD;
down your nat'ral feelin's tell we find her. When&#xD;
she's once diskivered, you can be led to her, I&#xD;
reckon; but till then, I don't, think it can be&#xD;
done. The truth is, that uncommon woman&#xD;
slipped away from us when we wasn't expectin'&#xD;
it ; if it hadn't been 'for that'carcumstalce, your&#xD;
wouldn't have seen us here, for we're arter her."&#xD;
Mr. Bellmar's countenance  indicated the&#xD;
Alepths of his disappointment, while Brion pro.&#xD;
ceeded to explain the matter as well as he could ;&#xD;
in addition to which he mae a general state-&#xD;
ment of all that had happened to Mignon, as far&#xD;
as he knew.&#xD;
"I trust," said Monsieur Bellmar, after a&#xD;
pause, "that my daughter's deportment has been&#xD;
at all times such as becomes one of her years&#xD;
and sex ?"&#xD;
" Guns and gunpowder ! if she'd been queen&#xD;
of England, she couldn't conducted herself nd&#xD;
better ! I say it without meanin' no hurt'to any-&#xD;
body'of her'kind ; but I've never seen her 'dqual,&#xD;
on the prairies or off, in towns or cities, and I'm&#xD;
forty and up'ards."&#xD;
Buckeye spoke with particular enthusiasm,&#xD;
rounding the fikki-period with a vigorous cut of&#xD;
his right hand throughlythe:air.&#xD;
Belimarlooked gratefully at thestrapper, of&#xD;
whose sincerityhe had not a doubt,'his earnest-&#xD;
ness fully attesting to his honesty.&#xD;

CHAPTER XV&#xD;
COnCLUSION.&#xD;
LEAVING these parties, we return once more to&#xD;
Mignon. She had retired as usual, but a little&#xD;
after midnight was awakenedrby a-sense of suf-&#xD;
focation, and discovered that-a handkerchief-was&#xD;
tied tightly across her mouth, and her hands&#xD;
firmly held by a man, who instantly raised her&#xD;
in his arms and bore her swiftly from-the tent.&#xD;
'Be quiet, mademoiselle! no personal injury&#xD;
ordisrespect is intended," said a voice which she&#xD;
recognized as Headley's. Mignon struggled and&#xD;
attempted to alarm the camp, but against Head-&#xD;
ley her feeble strength availed nothing. She was&#xD;
,on clear of the canon, when she was placed&#xD;
upon a horse ; but the handkerchief was not-re-&#xD;
moved untilshe had ridden as far as the timber,&#xD;
where Headley was joined by Beavertaker who&#xD;
had just reached the spot with several horses,'&#xD;
her ovi among the number, which, as the reader&#xD;
knows, he had stolen.&#xD;
Mignon being free from the restraint of the&#xD;
handkerchief wasof course at liberty to express&#xD;
her-indignation at such an outrage ; a privilege&#xD;
ofwhich she did not hesitateto avail herself.&#xD;
" Mademoiselle Bellmar, I am acting under&#xD;
the influence of a passion that masters me. Do&#xD;
not hold me responsible for ay deeds'; indeed,&#xD;
you have driven me mad !" said he.&#xD;
"You screen: yourself :under a miserable sub-&#xD;
terfuge ! You cannot disguise from me the fact&#xD;
that' youare acting under the instructions of&#xD;
Pierre Mariot," Mignon replied.,.&#xD;
"In adoring you; I most certainly do not act-&#xD;
ander his orders," returned the Missourian.&#xD;
" Tell me yoiff purpose ?" said Mignon.&#xD;
'My hope is that at some future time you will&#xD;
come to regard me in a manner far more kindly,"&#xD;
responded Headley, with an air of humility.&#xD;
"If you would have such hope realized, con-&#xD;
duct me whence you have -taken me," she re-&#xD;
plied.&#xD;
" That I cannot consent to do; though if you&#xD;
fill, I will save you from  annoyance from&#xD;
Market."&#xD;
"That you may annoy me yourself- Yes, I&#xD;
see; but the change will not be welcomed by&#xD;
me. I demand my liberty, and you cannot, if a&#xD;
man of honor, refuse my wish. Whenwoman&#xD;
sues lanshould 'otbe-inflexible."  -&#xD;
" I could witness yourdeathirith'more' calm-&#xD;
ness than your, return to Captain Brion, Miss&#xD;
Bellmar !" he exclaimed, with emphasis.;;&#xD;
&#xD;
REflPATHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Then entreaties are vain;"and it only re-&#xD;
mains forme to submit to my fate; begging, how-&#xD;
ever; to be treated-with the.deference due t¢ my&#xD;
sex and honor," saidMignon,-deepai$ngly.&#xD;
"You can do no more and no better, madem-&#xD;
oiselle." If you,,prefer, you may ride your own-&#xD;
horse, you- perceive he is here ,"   I&#xD;
" Yes, I preferto ride Brave,..suffer me to do&#xD;
so." It was some alleviation of her distress to&#xD;
find herself upon her favorite steed again; and&#xD;
she indulged also a secret hope that s  ight&#xD;
escape by ;reason of his speed, by takin , an-&#xD;
tage of some moment 'when Headley was less&#xD;
watchful. She observed that blankets had been&#xD;
cut in pieces and tied upon the horses' feet to&#xD;
render the trail indistinct; also that the hardest&#xD;
ground was chosen to favorthe same intent.&#xD;
The party crossed the Nebraska before sunrise,&#xD;
upon a raft that had been constructed for that&#xD;
purpose, which was destroyed when they reached&#xD;
the shore. Mignon's patience and firmness was&#xD;
tiken put to a severe test, for Mariot joined them,&#xD;
accompanied by Kincaid, but the latter imme-&#xD;
diately left with Beavertaker, and did  not&#xD;
return.&#xD;
Mariot' affected a dignity and reseda  which&#xD;
Mignon knew was foreign to his character, and&#xD;
which was assumed to cover .his designs from&#xD;
Headley, also to awe thetfair captive into silence&#xD;
and respect.&#xD;
They now travelled very fast, Pierre being&#xD;
careful to keep at some distance from the young.&#xD;
lady, wishing to' escape her keen questioning,'&#xD;
and deserved rebuke. Mignon quickened the&#xD;
pace of Brave and rode to his side. She desired.&#xD;
to be informed by what authority he assumed&#xD;
the control of her person, an4 where he intended&#xD;
to conduct her. Mariot replied to the effect-that&#xD;
she must content herself not-to know at present,&#xD;
but that all, eventually, would result to herad-&#xD;
vantage.&#xD;
This was unsatisfactory; Miss Bellmar urged&#xD;
her just interrogatories with becoming spirit.&#xD;
The Frenchman finally grew angry, and .re-&#xD;
proached her for rejecting ,him at Westport, ac-&#xD;
cusing her also of unmaidenly conduct in plac-&#xD;
ing, herself-under the protection of Captain&#xD;
Brion, a rough and rude.trapper, -,ot fit for the&#xD;
companionship of one gently reared, and possess-&#xD;
ed of lady-like and reined instincts.&#xD;
" Evil-minded, invidious man t" exclaimed&#xD;
Mignon, vexed and wounded by his-base intima-&#xD;
tions. "My aversion for your .character mo-&#xD;
mentarily increases. ' Think not to shake my&#xD;
&#xD;
1~&#xD;
&#xD;
constancy of.purpose, or conquer my contempt&#xD;
for you."&#xD;
Headley, who 'was riding in the rear, hearing&#xD;
the altercation, rode up and reproved Mario. for&#xD;
his bad temper, though in language not offen-&#xD;
sive. Pierre choked dgwn his resentment, and&#xD;
no more conversation of that nature ensued.&#xD;
As many of Headley's men as lIariot was able&#xD;
to mount had been sent forward the day pre-&#xD;
vidus; these they overtook before night; they&#xD;
were    ait for the remainder at a certain place&#xD;
kno     Beavertaker and Kincaid, who were to&#xD;
meet them upon the stolen horses and conduct&#xD;
them there by another route.&#xD;
Mignon complained of fatigue and requested&#xD;
Headley to encamp for the night ; an artifice&#xD;
which she hoped would prove advantageous to&#xD;
Brion, who, she doubted not, .would be able to&#xD;
find the trail, notwithstanding all the precautions&#xD;
taken. ' Mariot objected to this proposal, wish-&#xD;
ing to hurry on as fast as possible till morning.&#xD;
A difference of opinion thereupon arose, which&#xD;
was decided by vote among the men, and against&#xD;
the judgment of Mariot. This circumstance en-&#xD;
gendered. ill-feeling between the leaders, which,&#xD;
enhanc l by mutual jealousy, showed itself often&#xD;
the following day. Mignon foresaw a quarrel,&#xD;
which possibly might produce some change in&#xD;
her favor, -yet inwardly fearing the crisis that&#xD;
seemed approaching. The same scene in regard&#xD;
to camping was enacted at the close of the&#xD;
second day with the same results. Mignon slept&#xD;
and was hopeful-more hopeful than at any&#xD;
time since her abduction.&#xD;
The morning sun arose with peerless bright-&#xD;
ness. Nature was glorious in h beauty. The&#xD;
wide- spreading prairies exhalil eWeand fragrance.&#xD;
The little camp was astir. Mignon stood near&#xD;
Brave, with her eyes turned wishfully toward&#xD;
the Wind River Mountains from which she was&#xD;
daily receding. Could she forget the scenes&#xD;
that had transpired at the feet of those mighty&#xD;
ranges ? Never!l they had impressed their&#xD;
- thrilling events upon her soul, to remain there'as'&#xD;
long'as life and memory lasted.&#xD;
-Mariot. approached.. Mignon remarked that&#xD;
his face wore a gloomy expression. Headley&#xD;
followed him; both stopped a" few'paces from&#xD;
her.&#xD;
'Ihope,' she said, addressing Mariot, "that&#xD;
you have come to tell me that you regret what&#xD;
you hate done ?"&#xD;
"No," he moodily replied, "I only regret&#xD;
your perverseness."   .&#xD;
&#xD;
88&#xD;
&#xD;
"How will you account - for your conduct to&#xD;
my father ?" resumed Mignon.&#xD;
"That need not give you uneasiness," return-&#xD;
ed Mariot.&#xD;
"Did the thought ever occur to you, Monsieur&#xD;
Mariot, that Redpath may be near us ?" inquir-&#xD;
ed Mignon, after a pause.,*-&#xD;
"Diable!" exclaimed Mariot, with a ,slight&#xD;
shudder. "I wish you would never speak that&#xD;
name in my hearing.&#xD;
"Is the dread of that- man then so strong&#xD;
upon you ?" she continued.&#xD;
"You have chosen an inauspicious subject&#xD;
mademoiselle !" impatiently rejoined Mariot.&#xD;
" Possibly so; but perhaps you believe in&#xD;
omens, premonitions, and such things ?". resum-&#xD;
ed Miss Bellinar, perceiving the theme annoyed&#xD;
him.&#xD;
" It matters iot;.it can make no great differ-&#xD;
ence in our present relations. That I feel dark&#xD;
within, and an unwonted gloom weighs heavily&#xD;
upon me, I confess. I will acknowledge even&#xD;
more than this-there is a vague yet terrible&#xD;
fear of death upori me."&#xD;
Mariot stood with his face to Mignon, his arms&#xD;
folded on his breast. His eyes were turned to&#xD;
her while he spoke with an expression that seem-&#xD;
ed to 'ask sympathy. At this moment his lips&#xD;
ceased moving, he groaned and fell at Mignon's&#xD;
feet, who, thinking he had fainted, looked at him&#xD;
with contempt; but that feeling. changed to ab-&#xD;
solute awe when she discovered ' the shaft of an&#xD;
arrow, the point of which was lodged inhis&#xD;
brain. While she gazed at this spectacle,. so&#xD;
unexpected and so fearful, a man rushed from a&#xD;
,growth of pinon just behind her, and embracing&#xD;
her, exclaimed :&#xD;
" My daughter ! my daughter 1"&#xD;
'(My dear father!" cried Mignon, recovering&#xD;
somewhat from her bewilderment and returning&#xD;
his caresses.  - -.&#xD;
"Beavers and otters 1"&#xD;
Mignon raised her eyes and saw Brion and-&#xD;
Buckeye approaching, and held out both hands&#xD;
to them.&#xD;
"Welcome'! most welcome !" she exclaimed,&#xD;
with' a radiantsmile.&#xD;
"Guns' and gunpowder! the cap'n's been&#xD;
most distracted, and gone through all sorts . of&#xD;
dangers-twelve fires-three days--roastingr-&#xD;
pine splinters !" added Buckeye, venturing to&#xD;
touch Mignon's little hand.&#xD;
" For' which he has my eternal gratitude,"&#xD;
said Monsieur Bellmar.&#xD;

"A&amp;amp;mine idamsdre," said Mignon.&#xD;
"Beard of Smitht h whatss'more'n that-he&#xD;
wants youyouselfI" quoth Buckeye, bluntly.&#xD;
"Ifmy-father does not say 'No,' why-Ithin k&#xD;
We inafjossiblyssrange it," said Mignoin.&#xD;
"pon   y'aoaul t  . believe 'it's a:nrranged&#xD;
already, and very welarranged,:too !'Diable !&#xD;
this wretched man died :suddenly," .added&#xD;
Bllmart&#xD;
"There's another that ought to-follow him,"&#xD;
affirmed Buekeye. " Where is the eretur, I&#xD;
wonder ?"&#xD;
Bielon looked arottd bfor'Headley, but.'he had&#xD;
disappeared; and we will remark here as the&#xD;
most'app opriate place, that he was never seen&#xD;
again by'any ode :of the parties; what became'&#xD;
of him is not known.&#xD;
Awed by the fate of Mariot, disappointed by&#xD;
the flight ofJeadley, and convicted of the error,&#xD;
they' had; committed, the gold-seekers flocked&#xD;
around the partisan .and manifested such signs&#xD;
of repentaneraid. begged~so hard to be received&#xD;
into his band again, that he'forgave them. The&#xD;
whole party immediately set out on their return&#xD;
to 'the:encampnient' at' the canon. The trap-&#xD;
per that had -started for the rescue of Brion&#xD;
from the 'Blackfeet, accompanied him to the&#xD;
rescue of Mignon; but were concealed in a wood&#xD;
about half a mile distant.&#xD;
While the body of Mariot was being interred,&#xD;
the partisan and:Mignon walked alone, discours-&#xD;
ing 'of recent events.  The- latter hearing a&#xD;
aund behind her, turned andbeheld iavenelaw.&#xD;
Brion also discovered him at the same -mo-&#xD;
ment.'&#xD;
" Son of the Buffalo !" said he,,calmly, "the,&#xD;
Great Spirit has given yon a charmed life. You&#xD;
have conquered 'your enemies; you have been&#xD;
as successful 'insWe as on the trail. You will&#xD;
live many moons,-andhe happy."=&#xD;
"Chief of the Blackfoot nation, may you live&#xD;
longer and be':happier than I,"' answered Brion,&#xD;
*arnaestly'°&#xD;
-4I: ask not for 'life," returned I avvuelaw;,&#xD;
proudly. ".The rising and setting of suns can&#xD;
fring no JOY.' thkos l of Ravenclaw; -the'wan-&#xD;
ing and falling ofAmoons are to him but mean-&#xD;
ingless'this.' 'But,ion of 4he Buffalo,.it is&#xD;
diffetent with thee; thou hest a country, thou&#xD;
hast Lilyfaee,"&#xD;
&#xD;
I0have much-to live for," said-Brion.&#xD;
"Your people are growing in greatness even:&#xD;
as mine are- dwindling away," added :Raven-&#xD;
clawsadly. "Y r Y nation Will ioon flow over&#xD;
these mountains, and my race will be pressed&#xD;
to -thosea, But I:shalenot'live to see it1 I&#xD;
shall have passed to the  duuting-grounds when&#xD;
the white' 'man plants uponthe graves of my&#xD;
fathers."f&#xD;
"Go'with me to the cities of the white nanj'&#xD;
suggested Brion.        .&#xD;
"Cursed be the cities of white me    'ed&#xD;
Ravenclaw.&#xD;
'"Ravenclaw, you have a noble nature," said&#xD;
Mignon, advancing and laying her hand on his&#xD;
arm. He looked, down upon her and amiled4&#xD;
The sunlight shining upon his lofty brow, lent a&#xD;
strange charm to his face.&#xD;
",The voice of Lilyface is like the dove," he&#xD;
added, softly.&#xD;
"Tell-me," resumed -Mignon, in a low. tone,&#xD;
her -hand-still upon his arm, "who is Redpath ?"&#xD;
He drew back haughtily, pushing her gently&#xD;
from 'him; his eyes glittered like fire.&#xD;
"Lilyface  bas a short memory; 'she has ,for-&#xD;
gotten what she heard in yonder motutains.&#xD;
Redpath is the son of the Eagle,- and he Scorns&#xD;
to share his' secret with another. Again I say,&#xD;
I know-him not ; that'to me he is the greatest&#xD;
of all mysteries-mysterious ,as the .soul within&#xD;
me. I repeat it--Redpath will live unknown -.&#xD;
he will die high up in the cliffs-no cars shall&#xD;
hear his passing thunder-the paleface, shall&#xD;
never behold his grave. To the great and awm&#xD;
ful Master of Life he will commgend his spirit,&#xD;
and pass away   becomes his name ,and deed.&#xD;
Son of the, B  al, adieu    Lilyf    '. the&#xD;
chief's voice faltered, a little-" Lilyface, farae-&#xD;
well, forever i"&#xD;
Ravenclawsprang from the rock; -his m jestie&#xD;
figure was visible ansinstant, and then was hid,&#xD;
denfromtheir sight-they saw him no ,moe..&#xD;
Brion's trapping campaigns are over. BY,: hs&#xD;
own fireside he talks with Mignon of .Redpthi&#xD;
Balaam, too, participates in his curiosity. Mig&#xD;
non grows pensive at the snention of his name,&#xD;
and is persuaded to this day, that Rvenclaw&#xD;
and Redpathlwere one; while Buckeye, in ;b&#xD;
annual visits to Westport, swears by the bear4&#xD;
of Smith," whatever Mignon says must betrue.&#xD;
