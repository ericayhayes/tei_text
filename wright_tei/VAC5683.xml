            <p>A BOOK without a preface, is like a house without a door, a pump without a handle, a man without a nose, meat without salt. A preface is the portal where one may stand in waiting, anticipating the favorable reception sure to follow; he may smell the savory viands that he will soon partake of.</p>
            <p>As a favorite comedian is always greeted with premonitory laughter in anticipation of the capital jokes to come, so we expect the good-natured public (they will all be good natured after they have read our book) will wreathe their countenances in smiles, and put some extra stitches in their buttons, in expectation of the broad grins and button-disturbing explosions sure to follow. If, as it has been said, "the<pb n="iv-v" xml:id="VAC5683-00000003"/> man who causes a single blade of grass to grow where none grew before, is a public benefactor," how much more entitled to this honorable distinction will <emph>we</emph> be, who sow the seed and gather a perfect harvest of grins. We present (for the small consideration of fifty cents) a full sheaf of laughter for every family—seed for everlasting fun—exemption from every kind of care for all mankind—are <emph>we</emph> not a benefactor? We rather think so. Reader, shall we sing of laughter? <q>
                  <lg type="quotation">
                     <l>What's the use of sighing,</l>
                     <l rend="ti-1">Care's a silly calf—</l>
                     <l>If to live you're trying,</l>
                     <l rend="ti-1">The only way's to laugh!</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
               <figure/> Or, shall we let "Jerrold" <emph>talk,</emph> as only <emph>he</emph> can. "Oh! glorious laughter! thou man-loving spirit, that for a time dost take the burden from the weary back; that dost lay salve to the feet, bruised and cut by flints and shards; that takest blood-baking melancholy by the nose and makest it grin despite itself; that all the sorrows of the past, doubts of the future, confoundest in the joy of the present; that makest man truly philosophic, conqueror of himself and care! What was talked of as the golden chain of Jove, was nothing but a succession of laughs, a chromatic scale of laughs, that reaches from earth to Olympus. It is not true Prometheus stole the fire, but the laughter of the gods to deify our clay, and in the abundance of our merriment, to make us reasonable creatures. Have you ever considered what men would be, destitute of the ennobling faculty of laughter? It is to the face of man, what synovia (I think anatomists call it) is to his joints: it oils, lubricates, and makes the human countenance divine; without it our faces would have been rigged hyena-like. The iniquities of our hearts, with no sweet antidote to work upon them, would have made the face of the best among us a horrid, dusky thing, with two sullen, hungry, cruel lights at the top—for foreheads would then have gone out of fashion—and a cavernous hole below the nose. Think of a babe without laughter—as it is its first intelligence. The creature shows the divinity of its origin and end, by smiling upon us; yes, smiles are its first talk with the world—smiles the first answer that it understands. And then, as worldy wisdom comes upon the little thing, it crows, it chuckles, it grins, and shakes in its nurse's arms, or in waggish humor, playing bo-peep with the breast, it reveals its destiny, declares to him with ears to hear the heirdom of its immortality. Let materialists blaspheme us gingerly and acutely as they will, they must end in confusion and laughter.</p>
            <p>Man may take his triumphant stand upon his broad grins, for he looks around the world, and his innermost soul, sweetly tickled with the knowledge, tells him that he of all creatures, laughs. Imagine, if you can, a laughing fish! Let man, then, send a loud ha! ha! <figure/> through the Universe, and be reverently grateful for the privilege. All men laugh somehow; the false-toothed man is never done grinning approbation of his dentist; the hearty laugher is indubitably honest;<pb n="vi-7" xml:id="VAC5683-00000004"/> the false man seldom gets beyond a sneer; the horse-laugher is a vulgar bore; the quiet laugher is usually acute and intelligent; simperers invariably think themselves pretty; the man who laughs convulsively has a touch of madness; he, who in laughing, buries his eyes in fat, and puckers his cheeks into a sheaf of wrinkles, is always a merry fellow. Sardonic laughter, like the wreath of Harmodius, is a dagger hid beneath flowers, but a benevolent smile is the fleeting remembrance of man before the fall. Reader, we intend to provoke <emph>that</emph> smile, may we not also count on the benevolence; we anticipate with certainty your gratification, may we not look with confidence for our reward. The success of a couple of similar works prepared by us, has induced us to again cater for the public amusement, and when we review the good things (original and selected, that is, "begged, borrowed, <emph>and</emph> stolen") prepared for an appreciating community, and as we examine and laugh (we can't help it) over these side-splitting illustrations, "got up" without regard to expense, we feel confident that the brilliant success of our book will enable us to say with truth that "Republics are <emph>not</emph> ungrateful." We might dwell with much emphasis and more wind, upon this interesting subject, but we will not delay our (soon to be) happy readers from the treat in store for them, particularly as they may accuse us of "BLOWING OUR OWN TRUMPET."</p>

               <p>—"Moral training," said Mrs. Partington, "is the best, arter all." She had heard some one in the omnibus speaking of moral training, and her benevolence gave it into the charge of memory until she got home, and memory revolved it, and pondered it, and reviewed it, and<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5683-00000005"/> fancy construed it to mean something about the military training that was to come off the next day. "I hope it will be a moral training, I'm shore," said she, "for I see the gov'nor is to be there in his new suite, and I hope they'll make their revolutions well before him. I do admire the millintery, where the sogers in their fancy unicorns look jest like a patchwork quilt. They wasn't moral trainings in old times, when men put 'enemies into their heads to steal away their hats,' as Mr. Smooth, the schoolmaster, used to say. Your uncle Paul had a good deal of millintery sperrit, sometimes, Isaac." Ike had remained very quiet while she was speaking. "What upon airth are you doing there, Isaac?" cried she. The young gentleman readily told her he was painting a man, at the same time displaying an animal, nominally of that description, done beautifully in chalk, which he appeared to look on with much satisfaction. "But what are you painting it with? As true as I'm alive you've got your uncle Paul's chalk that he draws what he calls his millintery diadrams—all out of his head on the old cherry table!"</p>

               <p>—A man lately received twenty lashes well laid on, at the whipping post at Delaware. The culprit, instead of bellowing when the constable applied the lash, laughed immoderately, which made the angry officer lay on with still harder force. On giving him the twentieth blow the angry officer could stand it no longer. "Well, here mister," said the offended officer, "I've done my duty, and I can lick ye no more, but I'd jest like to know what it is that's so funny!" "Funny!" roared the other, "why it's excellent. <emph>You've got the wrong Smith!</emph> I aint the man that was to be whipped! It's the other one! Now you'll have to go it all over again!

He made an observation once, when he was in one of his poor turns, that I shall never forget the longest day I live. He says to me one winter evenin' as he was sittin' by the fire—I was knittin', (I was always a wonderful knitter,) and he was a smokin' (he was a master hand to smoke, though the doctors used to tell him he'd be better off to let tobacco alone;) well, he took his pipe out o' his mouth, and turned towards<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5683-00000006"/> me—I know'd somethin' was comin', for he had a peculiar way o' lookin' round when he was gwine to say anythin' uncommon; well, says he to me, says he, 'Silly,' (my name was Priscilly, naturally, but he generally called me Silly, 'cause 'twas handy, you know,) well, says he to me, says he, 'Silly,' and he looked pretty solemn, I tell you—he had a solemn countenance, naturally—after he'd got to be a deacon 'twas more so, but since he'd lost his health he appeared solemner than ever—and certainly you wouldn't wonder at it if you know'd how much he underwent. He was troubled with a wonderful pain in the chest, and amazin' weakness in the spine of his back, besides the pleurisy in his side, and having the ager considerable part of the time, and bein' broke o' his rest o' nights, 'cause he was so put to it for breath when he laid down. How he had altered since the first time I see him! That was at a quiltin' at Squire Smith's a spell afore Sally was married. I'd no idea of that Sal Pendegras. Well, that was the first time I ever saw my husband; had any body'd told me that I should marry him, I should have said—but law sakes! I most forgot, I was gwine to tell you what he said that evenin', and when a body begins to tell a thing, I believe in finishin' on't some time or other. Some folks have a strange way of talkin' round for ever, and never comin' to the pint, and takin' twenty words to say what might be told in five, says he, 'Silly'—he'd a kept on sayin' 'Silly' from time to eternity, 'cause you know he wanted me to pay particular attention to him, and I generally did; a woman was never more attentive to her husband than I was. Well, he says to me, says he, 'Silly'—says I, 'what?' though I'd no idea what he was gwine to say—didn't know but 'twas somethin' about his sufferins. Says he to me, says he, 'Silly'—(I could see by the light o' the fire—there didn't happen to be a candle a burnin', if I don't disremember, though my memory is sometimes forgetful, but I know we wa'nt apt to burn candles exceptin' we had company—I could see by the light o' the fire that his mind was uncommonly solemnized)—he says to me, says he, 'Silly,' says I, 'what?'

               <p>—Mrs. Partington was in Woon-socket when Barnum and his elephants came there, and Isaac and the old lady went to see them. She came away much excited, and on arriving at the house where she was visiting, her feelings found utterance as follows:—"Don't tell me about the knowingness and good manners of elephants, for I shan't believe it arter what's took place. Look at that bonnet." It was a fabric of rusty crape, high in the crown, with a sugar scoop front, upon the sides of which traces of a crush were evident. "I never was in such a flirtation in my born days," continued the old dame, trying to get the dints out of her headpiece. "You can't assuage me that they've got any decency or mortification in 'em at all, no more'n Ingen salvages, for while I stood looking at a dear little one, that I took at first for a black leather trunk that belonged to one of the big ones, one of 'em threw his arm over me and jammed my bonnet till it's a sight to be seen; another one put his arm around my neck a good deal too free, for I never was used to such treatment when I was young, and another one put his hand into my ridicule, and stole a ball of yarn, thinking it was an apple, I dare say. If Isaac hadn't pushed 'em away I do believe they would have made a sacrament of me on the spot."</p>

A straw is used by the young philosopher to demonstrate the exceeding lack of patience in a <unclear>cat</unclear> under difficulty, and from the good-humored look of Ike, it is evident, that however disagreeable the operation may be to the cat, the result of the experiment is very satisfactory to the experimenter. It shows the selfishness of cats, and their opposition to the march of science, who let the trifling matter of personal inconvenience outweigh all considerations of benefit—what benefit Ike alone can tell. If he is willing to sacrifice himself in trying the experiment, it seems unreasonable for the cat to kick against it.</p>

She left the room to procure a light, and as soon as she had gone, the teapot was lowered by the invisible hand to its original station, and Ike stepped out from beneath the table, stowing a long string away in his pocket, and grinning prodigiously.</p>

               <head>A CHAPTER ON OMNIBUS RIDING.</head>
               <p>—To a lover of comfort, Life in Paris, when a revolution is breaking all your windows, and you are lying down flat on the floor to avoid the shower of bullets, is not very pleasant, or Life in Ireland, in a district where they have a weakness, just about quarter-day, of shooting, not the moon, but the landlord instead, cannot be exactly the highest attainment of human happiness;—but still we think any one of them is MAHOMET'S Paradise itself, (providing, of course, you escape dying, or being killed), compared to the LIFE IN AN OMNIBUS with twelve insides, two babies, a bird cage, a dog<figure/> and a washerwoman smelling strongly of rum and yellow soap! If DANTE had been alive at the present day, (and we can only regret he is not), he would certainly have placed his "Inferno" inside an omnibus! However, there is a melancholy pleasure in smiling over the annoyances that other people stoically endure, after one has had the courage to say, "I'll endure them no longer myself." It is wrong to smile; but one cannot help it.</p>

               <p>Now the action of putting the hand into the pocket is generally<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5683-00000011"/> an interesting operation for the mind. Assistance is mostly given to a man who shows a desire to perform that operation, so that he may perform it with the greatest ease to himself. But in an omnibus this delicate law of Anglican nature is reversed. The operator is wedged in so tight, that it is with difficulty he can move his arm to get his purse out. The fact is, every one knows that it is not to benefit himself, and they would see you and your purse at the bottom of the omnibus first, before they would move the thickness of a wafer to help you. How different would be the behavior of these very gentlemen, when standing behind the counters in their shops!</p>
               <p>This same sort of sluggish selfishness seems to take possession of the driver. He sees persons paying such little attention to each other's comforts, that he learns in time to pay no attention to them himself. The truth is, the selfishness inside gradually acts upon him, and he grows, at last, as selfish, perhaps more so, than any one else. He notices that the universal law in omnibuses is "Every one for himself;" and accordingly he applies that law to his own benefit. In the wild pursuit of it, it little matters to him what he does. He throws in children upon the mere speculation that "some gent will p'raps have the kindness to take them on his knee;" he takes up any number of women, blissfully unconscious whether the omnibus <figure/> will contain them or not; he will not "stop" a minute before it pleases him, though a dozen persons may be tugging at him all the while with a dozen hook sticks; and he will think nothing of "putting you down" in the middle of the road, while the passengers shout "ALL RIGHT! GO A-HEAD!"</p>

When a young chap steals a kiss from an Alabama girl, she says, "I reckon it's my time now," and gives him a box on the ear that he don't forget in a week. When a clever fellow steals a kiss from a Louisiana girl, she smiles, blushes deeply, and says—nothing. We think our girls have more taste and sense than those of down-east and Alabama. When a man is smart enough to steal the divine luxury from them, they are perfectly satisfied. In Lynn, Mass., when a female is saluted with a buss, she puts on her bonnet and shawl, and answereth thus,—"I am astonished at thy assurance, Jedediah; for this indignity I will sew thee up." Our New York Ladies receive a salute with Christian meekness: they follow the Scripture rule,—When smitten on the <emph>one cheek</emph> they turn the <emph>other also.</emph> When a Bergen girl gets kissed she very calmly remarks, "Hans, tat ish good;" and when a Block Island girl receives a buss, she exclaims with considerable animation, "Well, John, you've wiped my chaps off beautiful."</p>

                  <p>AS I was walking in the outskirts of that lovely and never to be forgotten village of Saratoga in the summer of 185- I was going up the hill, and involuntarily agreeing with the poet, "how hard it is to climb," when I saw in the distance the form of Seraphina Podgkinson. But might I not be mistaken. I would not credit such an improbability for a moment on the part of one who had presented me, only on my last birthday, with a magnificent pair of bead braces! But what did I see? By all that was false and jilting in woman, she had on the very <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mousseline de laine</foreign> I had<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5683-00000014"/> brought her from Paris. It was the very same sprig—the identical heart's-ease, lacerated with thorns; a pattern too indicative, alas! of my own happiness. I needed no further corroboration; my brain polkaed backwards and forwards, and then waltzed giddily round, and I felt vastly like one who had lost all his money at cards, and is conscious, for the first time, what a fool he has been! I rushed madly away, but could not help taking a farewell glance before I turned my back upon her for ever. Would I had been blind, for then I should not have witnessed with my burning eyes, the perfidious, aristocratic Seraphina giving her arm to a six-foot officer in the army!</p>

                  <p>I WAS killing a month at Saratoga till my hair had resumed its Rowland-like luxuriance, and, having nothing to do, in despair I took up the newspaper. Good gracious, what did I see! A police report, in which the name of my well-beloved Seraphina was mentioned. I involuntarily ground my teeth, as I thought of her perfidy, but still I could not control myself against unconsciously reading the following:—"Mary Duggins, a washerwoman, was charged with having on several occasions worn the dresses of her customers. It was proved that she had worn at Saratoga, on two distinct occasions, a handsome <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mousseline de laine</foreign> of the lovely Seraphina Podgkinson of Bond Street. Several gentlemen came forward and complained warmly of the indignity, and the very great annoyance their families had been subjected to in consequence of the innumerable <foreign xml:lang="FRA">contretemps</foreign> that had arisen from Mrs. Duggins wearing their daughters' dresses.</p>
                  <p>I started up like a madman. So then the figure I had seen on a Sunday was not my beloved Seraphina, but merely the mockery of her elegant self—the mere inanimate clothes that helped to adorn her poetical person! How I laughed at myself! To mistake a washerwoman for her, who had not her equal on the earth! Not to distinguish the native dignity of Podgkinson from the<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5683-00000015"/> innate soap-suds of a Mary Duggins! Oh. Jealousy! what nincompoops you make of the wisest men!</p>
                  <p>The following day I was in the arms of my dearest Seraphina. She quizzed me dreadfully, scolded me, inquired how many bumpers of prussic acid I had drank; and the following day sent me a curious little packet, which contained half-a-dozen of the genuine bears' grease imported from the North Pole. Could I mistake such undeniable proofs of affection? I should have been a Malthus, a Martineau, a stone, a mummy, a dummy, if I had not made Podgkinson the partner of my joys.</p>

               <p>—Mr. Thomas Twombley had drank but six glasses of brandy and water, when, being a man of discretion, he returned home at the seasonable hour of one A. M., and went soberly to bed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Thomas Twombley was too well accustomed to the goings and comings of Mr. Thomas, to be much disturbed by the trifling noise he made, on retiring; but when she discovered that he had his boots on, she requested him to remove them, or keep his feet out of bed.</p>
               <p>"My dear," said Mr. Twombley, in an apologetic tone, "'skuse me! How I came to forget the boots, I can't conceive, for I'm jes' sobe' 's I ever was 'n my life!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Twombley sat on the side of his bed, and made an effort to pull off his right boot. The attempt was successful, but it brought him to the floor. On regaining his feet, Mr. Twombley thought he saw the door open. As he was sure he shut the door on coming in, he was astonished; and, dark as it was in the room, he couldn't be mistaken, he felt certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Twombley staggered towards the door, to close it; when, to his still greater surprise, he saw a figure approach from beyond. Twombley stopped; the figure stopped. Twombley advanced again, and the figure did the same. Twombley raised his right hand—the figure raised its left.</p>
               <p>"Who's there!" roared Twombley, beginning to be frightened. The object made no reply. Twombley raised his boot in a menacing attitude—the figure defied him by shaking a similar object.</p>
               <p>"By the Lor!" cried Twombley, "I'll find out who you be, you sneakin' cuss!"</p>
               <p>He hurled his boot full at the head of his mysterious object, when—crash! went the big looking-glass, which Twombley had mistaken for the door!</p>

When his fire is out, and in shivering dread he slips 'neath the sheets of his lonely bed. How he draws up his toes, all encased in yarn hose, and he buries his nose and his toes, still encased in yarn hose, that they may not chance to get froze. Then he puffs and he blows and he swears that he knows, no mortal on earth ever suffered such woes; and with ah's! and with oh's! and with limbs so disposed, that neither his toes nor his nose may be froze, to his slumbers in silence the old bachelor goes. In the morn when the cock crows, and the sun had just rose, from beneath the bed-clothes pops the bachelor's nose, when he hears how the wind blows, and sees the windows all froze, why back 'neath the clothes pops the poor fellow's nose, for full well he knows if from his bed he rose, to put on his clothes, that he'd surely be froze.</p>

But Ike played on, and the sheet iron fireboard, like a Chinese gong, reverberated through the house.

Mendelssohn, kind old lady! "Isaac, do stop that noise, or I shall go raven distracted." Isaac ceased suddenly, the thunder storm cleared up, the gong became silent, the oven door remained mute on its hinges, and stillness reigned. Ike had broken his jewsharp.</p>

But hark! the door leading to our apartment is softly opened, and in our presence stands a mysterious looking stranger, holding in his right hand a carefully folded, but much worn and soiled, slip of paper.

"Where!" "Just yonder." "Will you show me the place?" "That I will, in less than no time at all almost," said the man, approaching a small wood of young timber. "Ah, there he is, sure enough, honey!" The gentleman looked up, and said, "I do not see him." "Then, by Saint Patrick, you must be blind—not see him! Just cast your two good looking eyes in that direction. Och, by the powers of mud, what's he about now? Only see how he swallows his head!" "Why, sir, that's a turtle, and not a horse." "A horse! and who the deuce said it was a horse? Sure a horse is not a strange creature," added he, pointing to the turtle, "and he has a saddle on; but, hang me if I'd bridle him for the whole kingdom of North America!"</p>

Take her right hand in yours, and draw her gently to you. Pass your left arm over her right shoulder, diagonally down across her back, under her left arm, and press her to your bosom.—At the same time she will throw her head back, and you have nothing to do but to lean a little forward and press your lips to hers, and the thing is done. Don't make a noise over it, as if you were firing off precussion caps, or trying the water-cocks of a steam-engine, nor pounce down upon it like a hungry hawk upon an innocent dove, but gently fold the damsel in your arms, without deranging the economy of her tippet or ruffle, and by a sweet pressure upon her mouth, revel in the sweet blisfulness of your situation, without smacking your lips on it as you would over a roast duck.</p>

               <p>—I knew an old man who believed that "what was to be, would be." He lived in Missouri, and was one day going out several miles through a region infested, in the early times, with very savage Indians. He always took his gun with him, but this time found that some one of the family had it out. As he would not go without it, some of his friends tantalized him by saying that there was no danger of the Indians; that he would not die until his time came, anyhow. "Yes," says the old fellow, "but suppose I was to meet an Indian, and <emph>his</emph> time had come, it wouldn't do not to have <emph>my</emph> gun."</p>

               <head>A POWERFUL LETTER.</head>
               <p>—An elderly lady and gentleman were riding a few days ago in an omnibus. Opposite to them sat a pleasant looking young lady with a fine, noble, chubby, crowing, bully of a boy in her lap. Conversation arose between the parties. A steamer from Chagres had just arrived, and the good looking lady, with the chubby juvenile, wished to know the news, remarking that her husband had been away fifteen months that day, and she was very anxious to hear from him. And then the good looking lady proceeded to indulge in a long and pathetic dissertation on the discomfort and annoyances of wives, when husbands go off and stay so long from their homes.</p>
               <p>"True, madam," remarked the elderly gentleman, who had never known the pride and pleasure of paternity: "but, then, that fine little fellow must be great pleasure and comfort to you," chucking at the same time the Jolly little fellow under the chin, who crowed, and swelled, and stared at the old gentleman's spectacles; "a remarkably fine boy—what may be his age, madam?"</p>
               <p>"Just three months, sir," replied the proud young mother.</p>
               <p>"Three months?" replied the elderly lady, "three months? I thought you said your husband had been away fifteen months?"</p>
               <p>The good looking lady blushed very deeply, but soon recovering the momentary confusion, and remembering herself, she ejaculated, "Oh, but he has <emph>writ</emph> once."</p>

               <p>—A Western paper tells the following story respecting a gallant widower who resides at Holley Springs, Mississippi, and who, it was said, had been casting the sheep's eye of affection at a certain amiable "vidder" in the neighborhood, although others thought his visits were covertly paid to the "vidder's darters." Be this how it may, one evening he called, as usual, and found the family party hard at work upon some garments of cloth. The girls were sewing, and the widow was pressing the seams. The widower "hung up his hat," and, as usual, took his seat by the fire; just at that moment it happened that the widow had done with the pressing iron (vulgo tailor's goose;) she set it down on the hearth, and called to her negro man in a loud voice—"Jake! Jake! <emph>come and take out this goose!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The widower started up in astonishment, not knowing what to make of this abrupt order.</p>
               <p>"Jake, do you hear?" again exclaimed the widow.</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon, Mrs. M.," said the widower with visible agitation, "but pray don't call Jake—if you wish me to leave your house, I will go at once without the interference of servants." The ladies roared with laughter, and it took some moments to explain to the chagrined widower his mistake. He has not been known to visit the widow M., since that memorable night.</p>

               <p>—"I once travelled through all the states of Maine with one of them chaps. He was as thin as a whippin' post. His skin looked like a blown bladder after some of the air had leaked out, kinder wrinkled and rumpled like, and his eye as dim as a lamp that's livin' on a short allowance of ile. He put me in mind of a pair of kitchen tongs, all legs, shaft, and head, and no belly: a real gander gutted looking critter, as holler as a bamboo walking cane, and twice as yaller. He actilly looked as if he had been picked off a rack at sea, and dragged through a gimlet hole. He was a lawyer. Thinks I, the Lord a massy on your clients, you hungry, half-starved looking critter you, you'll eat 'em up alive. You are just the chap to strain at a knat and swallow a camel, tank, shank, and flank, all at a gulp."</p>

               <p>—Mary the maid, who had gone up on Monday morning to make the beds, came flying down stairs, screaming "Murder! murder!" and staggered into the breakfast-room, where she fainted at the feet of Mrs. Gotobed and Miss Ditto, of ——, in this county. The ladies thought of flight, but their knees shook so industriously that no other motion was performable. Mary, beginning to recover, sighed heavily; her little heart fluttered and beat; her rosy lips parted; and an ejaculation escaped. "O-h-h-h! ma'am!" "Where is the villain?" gently whispered Miss. "Under the bed!" Mrs. and Miss uttered a dreadful scream, and Mary screamed in sympathy. But no succour was at hand; Mary's first cries had scared the poodle-dog out of gunshot. "Is the wretch a very big man?" inquired the old lady. "I did not stay to see him," replied her maid; "I ran away the moment I saw his sword behind the pillow!" "Oh! you young fool!" exclaimed her mistress, bursting in a peal of laughter, "I put the sword there myself, to be ready for robbers!" Mrs. Gotobed had drawn the sword, and Mary had drawn an inference.</p>

               <p>—<hi rend="i"/>Trial for Sleeping in Meeting.—"What do you know about John Hartley's sleeping in meeting?" demanded Justice Wilson, of a witness in a case before him.</p>
               <p>"I know all about it; 'taint no secret, I guess," replied the witness.</p>
               <p>"Then tell us about it; that's just what we want to know."</p>
               <p>"Well (scratching his head,) the long and the short of it is, John Hartley is a hard-working man; that is, he works mighty hard doing nothing, and that's the hardest work there is done. It will make a feller sleep quicker than poppy leaves. So it stands to reason that Hartley would naturally be a very sleepy sort of a person. Well, the weather is sometimes naturally considerable warm, and Parson Moody's sarmon is sometimes rather heavy-like—</p>
               <p>"Stop, Stop! No reflections upon Parson Moody; that's not what you were called for."</p>
               <p>"I don't cast no reflections upon Parson Moody. I was only telling what I know about John Hartley's sleeping in meeting; and it's my opinion, especially in warm weather, that sarmons that are heavy-like, and two hours long, naturally have a tendency—</p>
               <p>"Stop, stop! I say.—If you repeat any of these reflections on Parson Moody again, I'll commit you for contempt of court."</p>
               <p>"I don't cast no reflections upon Parson Moody. I was only telling what I know about John Hartley's sleeping in meeting."</p>
               <p>"Well, go on; and tell us about that. You were not called here to testify about Parson Moody."</p>
               <p>"That's what I'm trying to do, if you wouldn't keep putting me out. And it's my opinion in warm weather, folks is considerable apt to sleep in meeting; 'specially when the sarmon—I mean, 'specially when they get pretty tired. I know I find it pretty hard work to get by seventhly and eigthly in the sarmon myself; but if I once get by there I generally get into a kind of waking train again, and make out to weather it. But it isn't so with Hartley. I've generally noticed if he begins to gape at seventhly and eigthly, it's a gone goose with him before he gets through tenthly, and he has got to look out for another prop for his head somewhere, stiff enough to hold it up. And from tenthly to sixteenthly he's as dead as a door nail, till the amen brings the people up to prayers, and Hartley comes up with a jerk, just like opening a jacknife."</p>

The voice of Mrs. Partington, whom we left standing on the threshold of her admiration some way back, recalls us to herself. "How fluidly he talks!

He took with him, in a long Connecticut covered wagon, forty clocks, and sold and "put 'em up," along the country, in one direction, warranting them to keep "first-rate time." He exhausted his supply with but a single<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5683-00000048"/> exception; and then, with unparalleled assurance, he turned about and retraced his course. The last person to whom he had sold a clock, hailed him as he was going by:—"Look 'o here, stranger, that clock you sold me, aint worth a continental cuss. 'Twont go at all!" "You don't say so! Then <emph>you</emph> must ha' got it. Square! See, the fact is, I find by my numbers that there was <emph>one</emph> o' my clocks—I had forty on 'em when I first sot out—that I am a lettle afraid on: it was condemned to-hum 'for I come away; but some how or 'nother it got put into the wagon. What's the number o' your clock, Square?" "Fourteen thousand and one," replied his victim. "That's jest the blasted thing!" exclaimed the pedlar. "I'll chang' with yeou; yeou take my last one, and I'll take this hum. The <emph>works</emph> are good, I guess; on'y want fixin' a leetle." The exchange was made; and all along the road the pedlar was similarly arrested by his dupes, who were similarly duped in return. He took every successive bad clock to his next customer, and received another bad clock for the next.</p>

It so happened that a gray old sinner had obtained possession of one of the seats on the stage, where he sat, at every recurrence of this phrase, rubbing his toothless gums with a grin of complacent satisfaction, that greatly disturbed the gravity of the beholders. It was some time before the speaker discovered what was distracting the attention of his audience, but when he did he turned to the offender, and with redoubled earnestness exclaimed, "and dem what's got no teeth '<emph>ill hab to gum</emph> it!"</p>

"You shouldn't be glutinous, dear, you must be careful, or you will get something in your elementary canal or sarcophagus one of those days, that will kill you, Isaac (she had heard Dr. Weiting); and then you will have to be buried in the cold ground, and nobody wont never see you no more; and what will I do, Isaac? when you are cut down in your beauty like a lovely young cabbage plant in the garden that the grubs have eat off!" Much afflicted by the picture her prolific fancy had conjured up, she pensively sweetened her tea, for the fourth time, and looked earnestly upon Isaac, who heeding all that she was saying, sat gazing at the street door, revolving in his mind the practicability of his ringing the door bell unperceived, without going outside.</p>

The patient was a great believer in herbs and botanical productions, and was indeed very ill. The doctor felt his pulse, and as he was leaving the room, said, "Oh, cheer up, Mr. Jones; I'll send you some herb medicine that will put you all right again. I want to find your wife." To the latter, who met him on the stairs, he said: "Mrs. Jones, I'll be back here again very shortly, and meanwhile, make your husband a large bowl full of poppy-head tea." The wife of the sick man was a German woman, and didn't exactly understand what <emph>was</emph> ordered. As soon as the doctor was gone, she went into the yard, and took from a litter of Newfoundland puppies, five specimens, cut their heads off, and boiled them down, and gave her husband a part of the tea. In the evening, when the doctor returned, he asked—</p>
               <p>"Well, Mrs. Jones, have you done as I ordered you to do?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure I have, doctor."</p>

               <p>"How; kill you? What should he kill you for, good woman?"</p>
               <p>"Because, doctor, he's been offered five dollars a-piece for them Newfoundland puppies, and I know he wants the money."</p>
               <p>"Puppies, woman!" replied the astonished doctor; "what have you been giving your husband?"</p>
               <p>

               <head>ONE OF THE WITNESSES.</head>
               <p>—The late J. S., a man of infinite wit and humor, and who had probably seen as much of life in America as any one, used to tell the following story, which is too good to be lost, though probably no one but he could do justice to it. If we err not, it ran somehow thus:</p>
               <p>What railroad stock is in the East, steamboat shares are in the West; and as almost everybody owns more or less, it is almost an impossibility to procure a judgment against any company for injury, carelessness, or even loss of life. Such strange suits are very frequent, and give rise to some strange <foreign xml:lang="FRA">contretemps.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>Not long since, it seems, a steamboat called the "Old Kentuck" blew up, near the Trinity, at the mouth of the Ohio, where it is a well established fact that a great many musquitos will weigh a pound, by which accident a lady rejoicing in the name of Mrs. Jones, lost her husband and her trunk, and for both of which an action was brought.</p>
               <p>There was, strange to say, great difficulty in proving that Mr. Jones had been on the boat at the time of the collapse, that worthy having been notoriously drunk on the wharf-boat just as the steamer left Trinity.</p>
               <p>Many witnesses were examined to prove the fact, until finally a Mr. Deitzmar, a German, was placed upon the stand. Our friend J. S., was attorney for the boat, and elicted from Mr. Deitzmar this testimony.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Deitzmar, did you know the Old Kentuck?"</p>
               <p>"Yah, I was blown up mit her."</p>
               <p>"Were you on board when she collapsed her flue?"</p>
               <p>"When she butst de bile? yar, I wash dare."</p>
               <p>"Did you know Mr. Jones?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure. Mr. Jones and I took passenger to-gedder."</p>
               <p>"You did? When did you last see Mr. Jones on board the boat?"</p>
               <p>"Well! I didn't see Mr. Jones <emph>aboard</emph> de boat last time."</p>
               <p>J. S. fancied his case was safe, and with a most triumphant glance at the jury, said:</p>
               <p>"You did not? Well, Mr. Deitzmar, when last did you see Mr. Jones?"</p>

"<emph>Rather</emph> a rascal!" said she, slightly misapprehending his question, and patting her box affectionately, "yes, indeed, I think he is a great rascal! He sold me burnt peas for the best coffee, and it wasn't weight, nuther. When they built our new church, somebody said there was a nave in it, and I knowed in a minute who they meant. Why"——"I mean," interrupted the minister, blandly, laying his white hand gently on her arm, "I mean that he is quick-tempered." "Oh, that's quite another thing—yes, he is, very," and she changed the subject. But that word "irascible" ran in her head for an hour after he was gone, and when Ike came in she told him to take down the old Johnson's Decency, and find the defamation of it.</p>

Of course the number of applicants was very considerable. In fact nearly every one who saw the notice eagerly crowded to pay his respects to the generous fellow who seemed so willingly to reward the puissant practitioners of a seemingly commendable virtue. He asked them all this question—"Are you contented with your present condition?"

               <head>A CHAPTER ON FLATTERY.</head>
               <p>—Flattery is the confectionery of the world. In polite society it goes by the name of "soap," and in general is designated "soft sawder." It prevails over all: few are beneath it, none above it; the court, the camp, the church, are the scenes of its victories.</p>
               <p>To lay it on is a sublime science. It may be laid on with the delicacy of a camel's hair pencil, or with the thickness of a trowel. Some folks like it one way, some another; glazing and plastering are only two modes of the same thing.</p>
               <p>Fattery is like tickling. The person flattered finding himself gratified, and conscious that it is to the flatterer that he in indebted for the gratification, feels under an obligation to him, without inquiring the reason.</p>
               <p>Women are particularly fond of flattery, and you may lay it on with a trowel. But if you would wish to be exceedingly delicate, you may say, "I hope you do not pull the bed-clothes over your face at night, Miss?" The lady will anxiously inquire, "Why?" "For fear the brightness of your eyes should set them on fire," is your reply. You may also hint, that were you and this lady united in the bonds of wedlock, you would require no tinder but the tender passion, and no lucifer-match cigar-lighting machines, as her eyes would afford a light at all times.</p>
               <p>To pay a polite compliment, is the very essence of gentility. Talk to a man whose father was hanged, of public executions. To an old gentleman with a red nose, of the beauty of Bardolph's character. To a lady with false teeth, you may relate a story of a gentleman who was choked in swallowing them. To a gentleman with bandy legs, you may commence a dissertation on the analysation of curves of double curvature. To a lady with a large family, you may eulogise King Herod.</p>

Accordingly, up he goes to a farmer, and accosts him very civilly. "My good friend," says our hero, (whom we will call Tom,) "I'll make you an offer." "Of what, sur?" says the farmer. "Why," replies Tom, "I've been out all day fagging after birds, and haven't had a shot. Now, both my barrels are loaded—I should like to take home something; what shall I give you to let me have a shot with each barrel at those ducks and fowls—I standing here—and to have whatever I kill?" "What sort of a shot are you?" said the farmer. "Fairish!" said Tom, "fairish!" "And to <emph>have</emph> all you kill?" said the farmer, "eh?" "Exactly so," said Tom. "Five Dollars," said the farmer. "That's too much," said Tom. "I'll tell you what I'll do—I'll give a twenty shilling piece, which happens to be all the money I have in my pocket." "Well," said the man, "hand it over." The payment was made. Tom, true to his bargain, took his post by the barn-door, and let fly with one barrel, and then with the other, and such quacking and splashing, and screaming and fluttering, had never been seen in that place before. Away ran Tom, and, delighted<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5683-00000071"/> lighted at his success, picked up first a hen, then a chicken, then fished out a dying duck or two, and so on, until he numbered eight head of domestic game, with which his bag was nobly distended. "Those were right good shots, sur," said the farmer. "Yes," said Tom, "eight ducks and fowls were more than you bargained for, old fellow—worth rather more, I suspect, than twenty shillings—eh?" "Why, yes," said the man, scratching his head, "I think they be; but what do I care for that? <emph>they are none of them mine!</emph>" "Here," said Tom, "I was for once in my life <emph>beaten,</emph> and made off as fast as I could, for fear the right owner of my game might make his appearance—not but that I could have given the fellow that took me in seven times as much as I did, for his cunning and coolness."</p>

The whole company stared at me as if I had come without an invite, and I swear I thought my arms had grown a foot longer, for I couldn't get my hands into no sort of a comfortable fix: first I tried them on my lap; there they looked like going to prayers, or as if I was tied in that way: then I slung 'em down by my side, and they looked like two weights to a clock: and then I wanted to cross my legs, and I tried that, but my leg stuck out like a pump-handle. Then my head stuck up through a glazed shirt-collar, like a pig in a poke; then I wanted to spit, but the floor looked so fine that I would as soon have thought of spitting on the window; and then, to fix me out and out, they asked us all to sit down to dinner! Well, things went on smooth enough for a while, till we had got through one whet at it. Then an imp of a nigger came to me first, with a waiter of little bowls full of something, and a parcel of towels slung over his arm; so I clapped one of the bowls to my head, and drank it down at a swallow. Now, sir, what do you think was in it?" "Punch, I suppose," said the traveler laughing, or perhaps, apple toddy." "So I thought, and so would anybody, as dry as I was, and that wanted something to wash down the fainty stuffs I had been laying in; but no! it was water! Yes, you may laugh; but it was clean warm water! The others dipped their fingers into the bowls, and wiped them on the towels as well as they could for giggling; but it was all the fault of that pampered nigger in bringing it to me first. As soon as I catched his eye, I gin him a wink, as much as to let him know, if ever I caught him on my trail, I would wipe him down with a hickory towel."</p>

               <head>TROUT FISHING.</head>
               <p>—We have a friend who is a somewhat practical joker, residing in a pleasant country residence near the ocean. Some time since he had a visit from Professor ——, of poetic memory. The professor is a keen trout fisherman, and seeing a pond at some distance from R's residence, he inquired—</p>
               <p>"Can you fish for trout in that pond?"</p>
               <p>"O, yes," said R., "as well as not."</p>
               <p>"Possible!—where's your rod?"</p>
               <p>"I have none. I'm no fisherman. But if you want to try, we'll go over to S———, and get tackle, and you may try your hand at it to-morrow."</p>
               <p>It was thereupon agreed to do so, and the day was passed by the worthy professor in preparations for angling.</p>
               <p>The next morning early, R. drove him over to the pond, and he whipped it all around to windward and leeward, and finally waded in up to his waist, and threw his flies most skillfully, but never raised a fin. At length, as the sun grew tolerably hot, he turned to R. who lay under a tree solacing himself with a book and a cigar, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"I don't believe there is a trout in your pond."</p>
               <p>"I don't know that there is," replied R. imperturbably.</p>
               <p>"Why, you told me there was."</p>
               <p>"O, no," said R. leisurely turning and lighting another cigar, "you asked me if you could fish for trout here, and I said you could as well as not. I've seen folks do it often, but I never knew of one being caught here."</p>

               <head>SOMEBODY IN MY BED!</head>
               <p>—A week or two ago, during my peregrinations through northern Pennsylvania, spreading knowledge among the denizens thereof (I sell books), I "just dropped in" at a comfortable-looking inn, where I concluded to remain for a day or two. After a good substantial supper, I lit a "York County Principe," (the like of which sell in these regions <emph>four</emph> for a cent,) and seated myself in the ring formed around the bar-room stove. There was the brawny butcher, the effeminate tailor, a Yankee fiddler, two horse dealers, a speculator, a blackleg, the village Esculapius, and "the Captain," who, in consequence of being able to live on his means, was a person of no small importance, and therefore allowed to sit before the fire-stove with the poker to stir the fire—a mark of respect granted <emph>only</emph> to persons of standing.</p>
               <p>Yarn after yarn had been spun, and the hour for retiring had arrived—the landlord was dosing behind his bar—and the spirit of the conversation was beginning to flag, when the doctor whispered<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5683-00000074"/> to me, that if I would pay attention, he would "top off" with a good one.</p>
               <p>"I believe, captain," said the doctor, "I never told you about my adventure with a woman at my boarding-house, when I was attending the lecture."</p>
               <p>"No, let's have it," replied the individual addressed, who was a short flabby, fat man of about fifty, with a highly nervous temperament, and a very red face.</p>
               <p>"At the time I attended the lectures, I boarded at a house in which there were no females but the landlady and an old colored cook——"</p>
               <p>(Here the doctor made a slight pause; and the captain by way of requesting him to go on, said "Well.")</p>
               <p>"I often felt the want of female society to soften the severe labor of deep study, and dispel the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ennui</foreign> to which I was subject——"</p>
               <p>"Well," said the captain.</p>
               <p>"But as I feared that forming acquaintances among the ladies might interfere with my studies, I avoided them all——"</p>
               <p>"Well."</p>
               <p>"One evening, after listening to a long lecture on physical anatomy, and after dissecting a large negro, fatigued in body and mind, I went to my lodgings——"</p>
               <p>"Well," said the captain.</p>
               <p>"I went into the hall, took a large lamp, and went directly to my room, it being then after one o'clock——"</p>
               <p>"Well!"</p>
               <p>"I placed the light upon the table, and commenced undressing. I had hardly got my coat off when my attention was attracted to a frock and a quantity of petticoats, lying on a chair near the bed——"</p>
               <p>"Well!" said the captain, who began to show signs that he was deeply interested.</p>
               <p>"And a pair of beautiful small shoes and stockings on the floor. Of course I thought it strange, and was about to retire; but then I thought it was my room; I had at least a right to know who was in my bed."</p>
               <p>"Exactly," nodded the captain; "well."</p>
               <p>"So I took the light, went softly to the bed, and with a trembling hand drew aside the curtain. Heavens! what a sight! A young girl, I should say an angel, of about eighteen, was in there asleep——"</p>
               <p>"Well!" said the captain, giving his chair a hitch.</p>
               <p>"As I gazed upon her, I thought that I never witnessed anything more beautiful. From underneath a little night cap, rivalling the snow in whiteness, fell a stray ringlet over a neck and shoulders of alabaster——"</p>
               <p>"Well!" said the excited captain, giving his chair another hitch.</p>
               <p>"Never did I look upon a bust more perfectly formed. I took hold of the coverlid and softly pulled it down——"</p>
               <p>"Well!" said the captain, betraying the utmost excitement.</p>
               <p>"To her waist——"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Well!</emph>" said the captain, dropping the paper, and renewing the position of his legs.</p>
               <p>"She had on a night-dress, buttoned up before, but softly I opened the two first buttons——"</p>
               <p>"WELL!" said the captain, wrought to the highest pitch of excitement.</p>
               <p>"And then, ye gods! what a sight to gaze upon! A Hebe—pshaw! words fail. Just then——"</p>
               <p>"WELL!" said the captain, hitching his chair right and left, and squirting his tobacco-juice against the stove that it fairly fizzed again.</p>

They will remember his trip to town with the old rickety cart, full of turnips, drawn by the old gray horse, and that long red hill, the top of which, by his never failing elixir, spiced with a free use of the whip on the aforesaid grey, he had nearly reached when the back board of his cart fell out, and the turnips followed, rolling, jumping, and chasing each other down the hill, and into the ditches by the road side.</p>

He can talk of several different things at once, and without confusion. But he sometimes very ludicrously mixes up different subjects in the same sentence. For instance, lately dropping in at a book-auction, there happened to be a man who annoyed the company and the auctioneer with a segar. The book had gone up to twenty seven cents and a half, and the auctioneer, dwelling upon it, cried "And a half, and a half,"—when smelling the annoyance he shouted out, "D—n your segar!—and a half, and a half, and a half,—thirty—thirty-two and a half, and a half—kick out that man with a segar, and a half, and a half—going, going—thirty-five, thirty-five—thirty-seven and a half—curse that segar smoke!—and a half, and a half—I'd rather have the devil about me—and a half, and a half, and a half—it gives me the phthisic—and a half, and a half—going, going—forty, forty cents—forty two and a half—who's putting brimstone on the stove?—and a half, and a half, and a half—I wish I had hold of that boy—and a half, and a half, and a half—I'd choke the rascal—and a half, and a half—going, going—who says forty five—not half the price of the book—and a half, and a half—forty two, and a half—a treatise on the toothache, gentlemen—who'll give fifty cents for the toothache, and a half, and a half, forty-seven and a half—look at that boy there—and a half, and a half—pocketing one of those pen-knives and a half, and a half—I can't have my eyes everywhere—and a half, and a half—fifty—fifty two and a half—kick all the boys out of the room—and a half, and a half—kick'em out, I say—and a half, and a half—going, going, gone."</p>

The night of the third of April, was the<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5683-00000078"/> time agreed upon out west here for the grand exhibition of "ground and lofty tumbling;" and about ten o'clock of the said night, numbers of the Millerites assembled on the outskirts of the town, on a little eminence, upon which the proprietor had allowed a few trees to stand. In the crowd, and the only representative of his race present, was a free negro, by the name of Sam, about as ugly, black, woolly, and rough a descendant of Ham as ever baked his shins over a kitchen fire.</p>
               <p>Sam's head was small, body and arms very long, and his legs bore a remarkable resemblance to a pair of hams; in fact, put Sam on a horse, his legs clasped round its neck, his head towards the tail, and his arms clasped around the animal's hams, and at ten paces off you would swear he was an <emph>old set of patent gearing.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The leader of the Millerites, owing to an "ancient grudge he bore him," hated Sam like smoke, and had done all in his power to prevent his admittance among the "elect," but all to no purpose: Sam would creep in at every meeting, and to-night here he was again, dressed in a white robe of cheap cotton, secured to his body by a belt, and shouting and praying as loud as the best.</p>
               <p>Now, on the morning of the third, a genius named Cabe, had, with a deal of perseverance, and more trouble, managed to throw a half-inch hemp cord over the branch of an oak which stretched its long arm directly over the spot where the Millerites would assemble; one end he had secured to the body of the tree, and the other to a stump some distance off. About ten o'clock, when the excitement was getting about "eighty pounds to the inch," Cabe, wrapped in an old sheet, walked into the crowd, and proceeded to fasten, in as secure a manner as possible, the end of the rope to the back part of the belt which confined Sam's robe; and, having succeeded, "sloped" to join some of his companions who had the other end. The few stars in the sky threw a dim light over the scene, and in a few moments the voice of Sam was heard, exclaiming, "O Lor! I'se a a goin' up! Who-o-oh!" and, sure enough, Sam was seen mounting into the "ethereal blue;" this was, however, checked when he had cleared <foreign xml:lang="LAT">terra firma</foreign> a few feet. "Glory!" cried one; "Hallelujah!" another, and shrieks and yells made night hideous; some fainted, others prayed, and not a few dropped their robes and "slid." Now, whether it was owing to the lighteess of his head, or the length and weight of his heels, or both, Sam's position was not a pleasant one: the belt to which Cabe's cord was attached was bound exactly round his centre of gravity, and Sam swung like a pair of scales, head up and heels down, heels up and head down, at the same time sweeping over the crowd like a pendulum, which motion was accelerated by his strenuous clapping of hands and vigorous kicking. At length, he became alarmed; he <emph>wouldn't</emph> go up and he couldn't come down! "Lor a massy," cried he, "jest take up poor nigger to um bosom, or lef him down again, <emph>easy, easy.</emph> Lef him down agin, please um Lor, and dis nigger will go straight to um bed! Ugh-h!" and Sam's teeth chattered with affright, and he kicked again more vigorously than before, bringing his head directly downward and his heels up, when a woman, shrieking out, "O brother Sam, take me with you!" sprung at his head as he swept by her, and caught him by the wool, bringing him up "all standing." "Gosh, sister!" cried Sam, "lef go um poor nigger's <emph>har.</emph>" Cabe gave another pull at the rope, but the additional weight was too much; the belt gave way and down come Sam, his bullet-head taking the leader of the saints a "feeler" just between the eyes. "Gosh! is I down agin?" cried the bewildered Sam, gathering himself up. "I is, bress de Lor! but I was nearly dar, I seed de gate!" The leader took Sam by the nape of the neck, led him to the edge of the crowd, and, giving him a kick, said, "Leave, you cussed baboon! you are so ugly <emph>I knowed they wouldn't let you in!</emph>"</p>

               <p>—A young Tipperary widow, Nelly M'Phee, was courted and actually had an offer from Tooley O'Shane, on her way to her husband's funeral. "She accepted, of course," said Grossman. "No, she didn't," said Smith. "Tooley, dear," says she, "y're too late; four weeks ago it was I shook hands wi' Pat Sweeney upon it that I would have him a dacent time arter poor M'Phee was under board." "Well," said Grossman, "widows of all nations are much alike. There was a Dutch woman whose husband, Diedric Van Pronk, died and left her inconsolable. He was buried on Cop's Hill. Folks said that grief would kill that widow. She had a figure of wood carved that looked very like her late husband, and constantly kept it in bed for several months. In about half a year she became interested in a young shoemaker, who took the length of her foot, and finally married her. He had visited the widow not more than a fortnight when the servants told her they were out of kindling stuff, and asked what should be done. After a pause, the widow replied in a very quiet way—'Mape it ish well enough now to shplit up old Van Pronk vat is up-stairs.'"</p>

               <head>A "DOWN EAST" ORIGINAL.</head>
               <p>—I was rash enough on the first of the month to go into the country to live, seduced by Ralph Waldo Emerson's laudation of spring, and am heartily sick of it; for the wind has been on a blow ever since, and, like a big baby, made a child's rattle of everything it could lay its hands to, from a "huckleberry" bush up to an orthodox meeting-house. But there is one consolation—my hen's nest is so arranged that the eggs fall directly from the fowl into my skillet of hot water; consequently, I eat them fresher, perhaps, than they do at some boarding-houses, where the landladies appear to believe that they are not fit to cook until they have attained the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">haut gout;</foreign> or, perhaps, they keep them until they are <emph>cheap</emph> enough to eat, on the same principle that "Johnny L——" (of whom so many queer stories are told) kept his fish. "Johnny" was seen carrying home a piece of fresh salmon at a time when it was a dollar a pound. He was asked why he didn't wait until it was cheaper? "Aha!" replied Johnny, "I know what <emph>I'm</emph> about. I shall put it in my ice-chest; and when it gets down to twenty-five cents a pound, I shall eat it!"</p>
               <p>Johnny is the same "stick" who set a light that the rats might see to go into his trap; and when asked by the painter what letter he would have put on the panel of his carriage, preferred W., because he thought it the best looking in the whole alphabet. He once marked up the prices of his goods in a dull season, and, when he had finished the job, went home and told his wife he had made a thousand dollars by the operation, forgetting that the merchandise yet remained to be sold. Told once that his store was on fire, he said it couldn't be, for he had the key in his pocket; and he is said to have ordered a huge thermometer to regulate the weather, and locked his door to keep the heat out. When he had killed his pig, he sagely remarked that "it didn't weigh as much as he expected, and he never thought it would." He sold half of his porker to a neighbor; but it was a question how it should be divided, after cutting it across in the middle. The neighbor proposed that L—— should put his hand, unseen by him, on one extremity or the other, and he'd say, without knowing what it was, whether he would have it or not. Johnny consented, and, slightly cutting off the pig's curly termination, when his friend's back was turned, stuck it on the nose, and demanded, "Who shall have the part with the tail on?" "I!" exclaimed the other triumphantly. "Then you have got the fore-quarters!" said Johnny. On another occasion, some waggish butchers in the market persuaded him that it would improve the looks of his favorite dog to cut his tail shorter. Johnny assented; but fearing to trust the operation to any of the wags, he got them to hold the animal while he acted as surgeon, for he said he wanted only a very little amputated "to begin with." After calculating very nicely where to strike, Johnny raised the cleaver, at the same moment the butchers shoved the dog along; so that, when the knife had fallen, the poor man found that he had severed his cur in twain; whereupon he protested, in perfect dismay, that "it was a little too short, by a d—— sight!"</p>

               <p>—A book auctioneer, in Boston, a few evenings since, commenced his sale by offering a small number of second-hand books, part of a private library. Amongst the volumes was a large octavo copy of Johnson's Dictionary. "Now, gentlemen," said the auctioneer, "what's bid for this? it's just as good as new, and cost five dollars. What's bid? Is three dollars bid? two fifty? two dollars? Why, gentlemen, this cost two dollars to bind. Will nobody bid the price of binding? One seventy-five—one fifty? one twenty-five? one dollar? Now it's no use for this crowd to stand with their mouths open and no bids coming out. You must bid and there's no get off, no how. Not one dollar? Well, now I tell you right straight up and down, that you've got to bid! The book must be sold. The owner wouldn't sell it for less than four dollars, if he wasn't obliged to; but the fact is he wants money the <emph>worst kind;</emph> so it's no use to come the artful dodge; you <emph>must</emph> bid." This appeal was followed by a bid of one dollar. "Thank you," said the auctioneer; "one dollar, one dollar, one dollar; no advance, gentleman! One dollar, going, going, go-ing—gone! I shall sell nothing so cheap to-night, I tell you. Who's the bidder?" "Cash," said one of the crowd, handing up a bill on which the auctioneer gazed for a moment in evident dissatisfaction. Then transferring his gaze to the bidder, he exclaimed, "What do you call this?" "I call it a one dollar bill," said the latter. "Well, I call it," said the auctioneer, "a worthless scrap of paper issued by the Bangor Globe Bank, that busted all to pieces years ago, and you know it." "To be sure I do," said the bidder coolly, "but as you said the owner of the book wanted money <emph>the worst kind,</emph> I thought that would suit him to a charm!"</p>

The pretty quakeress blushed, as she replied with great circumspection, "Friend, thee must not do so impudent a thing." "By heavens, I will!" exclaimed the traveler.

               <head>RAISING THE PRICE OF BOARD.</head>
               <p>—At the time of General Taylor's inauguration, a long, tall, hungry, ungainly fellow, whose hands hung as low as his knees when he stood up straight, made his appearance at Coleman's and took lodgings. He sat pretty near the end of the table every day at dinner, and ate inordinately. Soup, fish, flesh, fowl, desert—his enormously long arms kept sweeping round like the arms of a huge wind-mill, gathering in everything that fell within the area of a circle they described.</p>
               <p>His voracity and beastly gluttonness so disgusted the other boarders, that about a dozen of them went to Coleman and told him he must get rid of the fellow, or they would positively quit the house.</p>
               <p>Coleman reflected a while, and finally thought he had hit upon a plan. So he took the fellow aside, and told him that, owing to the unusual crowd of people in the city, and the plethora of every hotel and boarding-house, provision had become scarce and high, and he found that he was losing money, and should be compelled to raise the price of board from two dollars and a half to three dollars a day.</p>
               <p>"Don't," said the fellow, "don't do it! I shall die if you do. It nearly kills me now to eat two dollars and a half's worth, and if you raise the price to three dollars, I shall die in two days. Don't do it, if you please!"</p>

In token of the truth of this statement, it need only be stated that his courtship lasted seven years. Six years and a half had passed away, and the reverend gentleman had got no farther forward than he had been the first six days. This state of things became intolerable, a step in advance must be made, and Mr. Brown summoned all his courage for the deed. "Janet," said he, as they sat in solemn silence, "we've been acquainted now for six years an' mair, and I've never gotten a kiss yet. D'ye think I might take one, my bonnie girl?" "Just as you like, John; only be becoming and proper wi' it." "Surely, Janet, we'll ask a blessing." The blessing was asked—the kiss was taken; and the worthy divine, perfectly overpowered with the blissful sensation, most rapturously exclaimed, "O! woman! but it is gude. We'll return thanks." Six months made the pious couple man and wife; and added his descendant, who humorously told the tale, a happier couple never spent a long and useful life together.</p>

               <p>—On a voyage from Liverpool to New York, there were among the passengers a Scotch clergyman and a middle-aged maiden lady. The latter, with the foresight or rather fussiness—of her class, had provided herself with all manner of antidotes againt sea-sickness, not the most disagreeable of which was a case of annisette cordial. Now, it happened that a fine active tar, one of the crew, had on several occasions rendered some slight service to this lady, and being desirous of repaying the obligation, she one afternoon presented Jack with a large bottle of annisette. Whether he was unconscious of the strength, or beguiled by the sweetness of the liquid, was never ascertained; certain it is, that some half hour after the ceremony of<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5683-00000086"/> presentation, Jack being ordered aloft, made a misstep, and was precipitated into the angry flood. There was but a light breeze stirring; the cry of "man overboard!" brought every one on deck, and though the order to "back topsails" was given almost simultaneously with Jack's plunge, he was some half mile astern before the boat could be lowered and manned. But he was a lusty swimmer, and bore up bravely, singing out to those in the boat, as he rose upon the surges, "Bear a hand, d—n your eyes! don't you see I'm swallowing the ocean?"</p>
               <p>With little difficulty he was got into the boat, and soon, dripping like a wet Newfoundland dog, was in safety on the vessel's deck. The clergyman naturally supposing that this would be a most favorable opportunity to impress upon Jack's mind the importance of greater attention to his religious duties, &amp;c., advanced and made him a most impressive exhortation, dwelt on the imminent peril from which he had just been providentially rescued, urged him in future to be more regardful of his religious duties, to give up drinking, profane swearing, &amp;c., in short, read him a proper and serious homily. The sailor listened gravely and attentively to the end, then giving a hitch to both sides of his trousers, at once exclaimed as he started for the forecastle—</p>

               <p>—A New Zealand chief having been converted by the powerful arguments of a missionary, requested, after the meeting was over, to be admitted to the Christian church. After a short conversation, the missionary discovered a serious obstacle in the path of the new convert—he was encumbered with <emph>nine wives.</emph> This objection was stated to him, and he was advised to retain one of them and make some suitable <emph>provision</emph> for the others. Disappointed in his first effort towards Christianity, the aspirant for the church walked off with a thoughtful countenance, and was not seen again for a month or more, when he came again to the missionary, and, with a joyful air, proclaimed himself a suitable candidate for admission to the church. "But your wives!" said the clergyman. "Ah, me hab only one wife now." "What provision have you made for the others?" "Ah, me make berry fine provision," said the convert, smacking his lips; "<emph>me eat the other eight!</emph>" Of course the church was too full at that time.</p>

               <head>A HARD KNOCK.</head>
               <p>—A County Court was sitting a while ago, in ———, on the banks of the Connecticut. It was—cold weather anyhow—and a knot of lawyers had collected around the old Franklin in the bar-room. The fire blazed, and mugs of flip were passing away without a groan, when in came a rough, gaunt looking "babe of the woods," knapsack on shoulder and staff in hand. He looked cold and half perambulated the circle which hemmed in the fire, as with a wall of brass, looking for a chance to warm his shins. Nobody moved, however; and unable to sit down for want of a chair, he did the next best thing—leaned against the wall, and listened to a legal discussion that was going on, as if he was the judge to decide the matter. Soon he attracted the attention of the company, and a young sprig spoke to him.</p>
               <p>"You look like a traveler."</p>

               <head>CROSS QUESTIONING.</head>
               <p>—The practice of many eminent lawyers of cross-questioning honest witnesses in such a manner as to confuse them and make them contradict themselves, and thereby destroy their testimony, should be frowned upon by every presiding judge. But it sometimes happens that lawyers, who undertake to break down witnesses in this way, meet with men who are more than their equals in ready wit, if they are not in legal knowledge. We know of an instance in which a witness had given in his testimony in a very modest and quiet manner, and after he had concluded, the counsel on the opposite side wished to cross-question him. After asking a great many questions which had no bearing upon the case, and which were impertinent, to say the least, the counsel asked—</p>
               <p>"Do you know my client and the horse about which this suit has been brought?"</p>

               <p>Here the wary lawyer thought he had caught the witness, and looking about him with an air of triumph, and a sarcastic smile upon his countenance, he said—</p>
               <p>"You will please state how you have seen my client ride this horse 'double and round.'"</p>
               <p>"Well, sir," replied the witness, "I have seen him ride the horse when he was so drunk that he could not sit up, and he bent himself <emph>double</emph> and rode <emph>round,</emph> when he went home, a distance of a mile and a half in order to go by a grog-shop, when he might have gone home by riding a half a mile!"</p>

               <p>"Hold on, that's just what I was getting at. You see Captain Perry asked me to take a drink, and so—I did; I knew that I wanted to drink, or I shouldn't have been so very dry. So Captain Perry and I went to the ball—Captain Perry was putting in some extras on one toe. I sung out, 'Go it, Captain Perry, if you bust your biler.' With that a man steps up to me, says he, "See here, stranger, you must leave." Says I, "what must I leave fur?" Says he, "You're making too much noise." Says I, "I've been in bigger crowds than this, and made more noise, and didn't leave nuther." With that he tuck me by the nap of the neck, and the seat of the breeches—and I left.</p>
               <p>"As I was shoven down the street, I met a lady—I knew she was a lady by a remark she made. Says she, "Young man, I reckon you'll go home with me." Politeness wouldn't let me refuse, and so I went. I'd been in the house but a minute, when I heard considerable of a knocking at the door. I know'd the chap wanted to get in, whoever he was, or he wouldn't have kept up such a tremendous racket. By and by says a voice, "Ef you don't open, I'll bust in the door. And so he did. I put on a bold face, and says I, "Stranger, does this woman belong to you?" Says he, "She does." "Then," says I, "she's a lady, I think, from all that I have seen of her."</p>
               <p>"With that he came at me with a pistol in one hand and a bowie knife in the other, and being a little pressed for room, I jumped through the window, leaving the bigger portion of my coat tail. As I was streaking it down town with the fragment fluttering to the breeze, I met a friend. I knew he was a friend, by a remark he made. Says he, "Go it, bob tail, he's gainin' on you.' And that's the way I happened in your engine room. I'm a good swimmer, captain, but do excuse me, if you please, from taking the water."</p>

               <p>—The style of the Schottische is full of graceful positions, and has the combined beauties of the St. Vitus and Indian war dances, with a strong insinuation of an afflicted cat upon hot building materials. The most popular, elegant and, in fact, the only acknowledged fashion of executing the Schottische, is this: As the music leads off, plunge suddenly forward with four abrupt jerks of the hand to keep time, then as suddenly dart back again with the same jumps and jerks. Then stand on one leg, as much like a lame duck as you can, change quickly to the other, and hop round four times. In this you must take great care to lift up your legs, as if for instance, something heavy had fallen on your soft corn at one time, or boiling cobbler's wax had been inserted in your boots. The effort is very pleasant<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5683-00000098"/> to look at. Continue in this way anywhere in the room, but be certain to whirl your partner until you can see nothing distinctly, for you can never arrive at the full enjoyment of the Schottische until you reach this crisis. You then run amuck among the other Schottische until you experience a shock, which will be caused by a pair of teetotums; but never heed that. If you would by chance see another couple near you, which, however, will rarely happen, never stop to try to get out of the way, as that is directly contrary to the science and etiquette of the Scohttische, but go on, and if a lady is floored (elegant and expressive) it is none of your business; if you are a large man, the amusement is much greater, as then, instead of your being knocked down every time by the concussions, it is greatly in your favor, that the other party may be knocked down instead.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>—O yes, sir, I have several; but we have concluded to make farmers of the others. I told my old man I thought this little feller would make a first rate lawyer, and so I called to see if you would take him.</p>

               <p>—Names do make a difference in things, no doubt. At least most people think so, and act in accordance with the supposition. Certain defects and diseases have been rendered "quite genteel" for a time, by dint of elegant names. Even a "cold in the head"—the most provoking, vulgar, and disgusting disorder possible to honest people, can be qualified and palliated a little by calling it an "influenza." We once called upon a gentleman and his wife—the former a plain, blunt man, the latter a "genteel" affected woman—both thoroughly sick<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC5683-00000103"/> with a cold in the head. The man was taking it naturally and hard. The woman was dressed in rather a showy, carefully made dishabille, and clearly doing her best to make a handsome thing of her uncomfortable situation. "And how is madame, to-day?" said we, addressing the lady. "Oh, shockingly ill," replied the woman, trying to look interesting, in spite of her swollen eyes and red nose, "I am afflicted with the prevailing influenzah," and she pronounced the last two words as if she were establishing her character as a fashionable woman, by her elegant manner of having the "influenzah." "And you sick, too," said we, addressing the husband. "Yes, sir," said the man with an honest emphasis—"Yes sir,—I'm having this d—d horse distemper that's round here!"</p>

               <head>GETTING UP AN EXAMINATION.</head>
               <p>—"A traveller, who we afterwards knew, once arrived at a village inn, after a hard day's travel, and being very tired, requested a room to sleep in, but the landlord said they were entirely full, and it was utterly impossible to accommodate him—that his wife had to sleep on the sofa, and himself on the floor; but that he would see what his wife could do for him. The good woman, on being applied to, said that there was one room which he might occupy, provided he would agree to the conditions, viz: to enter the room late, in the dark, and leave it early in the morning, to prevent scandal, as the room was occupied by a lady. This he agreed to. About two o'clock that night an awful noise was heard in the house, and our friend, the traveller, was found tumbling heels over head down stairs. On our host and hostess reaching the spot, and inquiring what the matter was, the traveller ejaculated, as soon as he was able to speak:—"Oh, Lord, <emph>the woman's dead!</emph>" "I know that," said the landlady, "<emph>but how did you find it out!</emph>"</p>

"But it's so in the paper, aunt," said Ike; and he again read the sentence, emphasising the word "<emph>phonotopy</emph>" prodigiously. Mrs. Partington adjusted her specs, and looked at it, letter by letter, to be assured. "Well, if ever?" said she, holding up her hands; "I declare I don't know what they're gwine to do next. They're always organizing or piana-fortin the schools, and now this funny topy comes along to make 'em laugh, I s'pose, when they ought to be getting their lessons. Sich levity is offal.

"What is the matter!—what is the matter?" inquired the traveller. "Oh I'm out o' tebacker," replied he, "got any about yer?"</p>

               <head>WOMEN AND DANCING.</head>
               <p>—The following humorous yarn was spun by Lever, the facetious author of Chas. O'Malley.</p>
               <p>"I believe a woman would do a great deal for a dance," said Dr. Growling; "they are immensely fond of saltatory motion. I remember once in my life I used to flirt with one who was a great favorite in a provincial town where I lived, and confided to me she had no stockings to appear in, and without them her presence at the ball was out of the question."</p>
               <p>"That was a hint to you to buy the stockings," said Dick.</p>
               <p>"No; you're out," said Growling. "She knew that I was as poor as herself; but though she could not rely on my purse, she had every confidence in my taste and judgment, and consulted me on a plan she formed for going to the ball in proper trig. Now what do you think it was!"</p>
               <p>"To go in cotton, I suppose," said Dick.</p>
               <p>"Out again, sir—you'd never guess it; and only a woman could have hit upon the expedient. It was the fashion in those days for ladies in full dress to wear pink stockings, and she proposed painting her legs!"</p>
               <p>"Painting her legs!" they all exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Fact, sir," said the Doctor, "and she relied upon me for telling her if the cheat was successful."</p>
               <p>"And was it?" asked Durfy.</p>
               <p>"Don't be in a hurry, Tom, I complied on one condition, namely, that I should be the painter."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you old rascal!" said Dick.</p>
               <p>"A capital bargain," said Durfy.</p>
               <p>"But not a safe covenant," added the attorney.</p>
               <p>"Don't interrupt me, gentleman," said the doctor. "I got some rose pink, accordingly, and I defy all the hosiers in Nottingham to make a tighter fit than I did on little Jenny; and a prettier pair of stockings I never saw."</p>
               <p>"And she went to the ball?" said Dick.</p>
               <p>"She did."</p>
               <p>"And the trick succeeded!" said Durfy.</p>
               <p>"So completely," said the Doctor, "that several ladies asked her to recommend her dyer to them. So, you see what a woman will do to go to a dance. Poor little Jenny! she was a merry minx; by the by, she boxed my ears that night for a joke I made about the stockings. "Jenny," said I, "for fear your stockings should fall down when you are dancing, <emph>hadn't you better let me paint a pair of garters on them?</emph>"</p>

               <p>"And what do you do with mistakes?" said the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"Why, sir, I dispose of them in the same manner as you do. I rectify the large and let the small ones go. Not long since," continued he, "as I was preaching, I meant to observe that the devil was the father of <emph>liars;</emph> but made a mistake, and said the father of <emph>lawyers.</emph> The mistake was so small that I let it go."</p>

He is romping, shouting, blustering, and in all but his best estate a terrible torment, especially to his sisters. He don't pretend to much until he is twelve; then the rage for frock coats and high dickies commences. At fourteen he is too big to split wood or go after water, and at the time these interesting offices ought to be performed, contrives to be invisible; whether concealed in the garret with some old worm-eaten novel for a companion, ensconced in the wood-shed trying to learn legerdemain tricks, or bound off on some expedition that turns out to be in most cases more deplorable than explorable—to coin a word. At fifteen he has a tolerable experience of the world—<emph>but,</emph> from fifteen to twenty—may we be clear from the track when he is in sight; he knows more than Washington and Benjamin Franklin together; in other words, he knows more then, than he ever will know again.</p>

After several ineffectual efforts, and leaning now upon one of the graves, and now upon the other, for the support he required, he fell back, and throwing his hands out over the sods which covered the remains of his nearest neighbors, he exclaimed, "Well! never mind; <emph>I suppose we shall all rise together!</emph>"</p>

               <head>ONE OF THE WITNESSES.</head>
               <p>—Lawyers allege that there are four classes of witnesses—those who prove too much, those who prove too little, those of a totally negative character, and those of no character at all, who will prove anything. We have a case in point.</p>
               <p>Far, very far away from the tall Blue Mountains, at a little place called Sodom, there were upon a time three neighbors called in as arbitrators to settle a point relative to some stolen chickens, in dispute between one Lot Corson and a "hard case" called<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5683-00000114"/> Emanuel Allen, better known thereabout as King of the Marsh. "Mister Constable," said one of the demi-judicials, "now call the principal witness."</p>
               <p>"Lanty Oliphant! Lanty O-li-phant!" bawled Dogberry. "Mosey in and be swore."</p>
               <p>In obedience to this summons, little Lanty, in whom the bottle had usurped the place in the affections commonly assigned to soap and water, waddled up, and was qualified, deprecating by a look the necessity of such a useless ceremony among gentlemen.</p>
               <p>"Mister Oliphant, you are now swore. Do you know the value of an oath?" asked the senior of the board.</p>
               <p>"Doesn't I!" rejoined Lanty, with a wink at a by-stander. "Four bushel of weight wheat, the old score wiped off, and licker for the hull day throwed in."</p>
               <p>This matter-of-fact answer met a severe frown from the man with the red ribbon around his hat.</p>
               <p>"Well, Mister Oliphant," continued the senior, "tell all you know about this here case. Bill Morse, <emph>shoo</emph> your dog off that old sow."</p>
               <p>Lanty here testified. "Feeling a sort of outish t'other day, ses I to the old woman, ses I, 'I'll jist walk over to Lot's, and take a nipper or two this mornin,' ses I. 'It'll take the wind off my stomach sorter,' ses I. Then the old woman's feathers riz, they did, like a porkypine's bristles; and, ses she, 'if you'd on'y airn more bread and meat, and drink less whisky, you wouldn't have wind on your stomach.' 'Suse,' ses I, 'this is one of my resarved rights, and I goes agin home industry,' ses I, sort o' laughin out o' the wrong side o' my mouth. 'Resarved rights or desarved wrongs,' ses she, 'you'r always a drinkin and talkin politics when you orter be at work, and there's never nothin to eat in the house.' Well, as I was agoin over to Lot's jist fernent where the fence <emph>was,</emph> ses I to myself, ses I, if there isn't the old King's critters in my cornfield; so I'll jist go and tell him on't. When I gets there, 'Good morn'n Lanty,' ses he. 'Good mornin old hoss,' ses I; and when I went in, there was a pot on the fire a cookin, with a <emph>great big speckled rooster</emph> in it.</p>
               <p>"Mister Oliphant!" here interposed one of the arbitrators. "Remember that you are on oath. How do you know that the chicken in the pot was 'a big speckled rooster?"</p>
               <p>"'Kase I <emph>seed the feathers at the wood pile!</emph>" promptly responded Lanty, who then continued—</p>
               <p>"Well, when I gets to Lot's, 'Good mornin, Lot,' ses I. 'Good mornin, Lanty,' ses he. 'You didn't see nothin no where of nar' a big speckled rooster that didn't belong to nobody, did you?' ses he. 'Didn't I?' ses I. 'Come, Lanty,' ses he, 'let's take a nipper,' ses he; and then I up and tells him all about it."</p>
               <p>"Had Mr. Allen no chickens of his own?" asked the senior.</p>
               <p>"Sartin," rejoined Lanty; "but there warn't a rooster in the crowd. They was <emph>all layin' hens!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Well," inquired another of the referees, "how many of these hens had Mr. Allen?"</p>
               <p>This question fairly "stumped" Lanty for a moment; but he quickly answered—</p>
               <p>"Why, with what was there, and what wasn't there, counting little and big, spring chickens and all, <emph>there was forty odd</emph> EXACTLY!"</p>
               <p>No further questions were put to this witness.</p>

               <p>—The west is a great country. Tall things happen there now and then. Here is a specimen. Having occasion to pass through the upper lakes last June, I was so happy as to find myself a passenger on board that palace of a boat, the "Empire," Emperor Howe, commanding. My travelling companion for the time happened to be a thorough-bred "Hoosier," a prince of a fellow, one who feared God and loved fun and the ladies, but who was, withal, a most abominable stammerer. We had not been long aboard, when the captain called our attention to a most remarkable looking individual seated at the end of the cabin. I am not myself particularly handsome, and have seen some ill-looking fellows in my day, but, so ugly a man as this had never crossed the scope of <emph>my</emph> vision. Howe declared him emphatically the "ugliest man that ever lived," whereupon my friend Tom offered to wager half a dozen that he had seen a worse one in the steerage. The bet was at once accepted, and Tom started off for the man, who was to be brought up for comparison. He found the fellow a bit of a wag, as an intolerably ugly man is apt to be, and, after the promise of a "nip," nothing loth to exhibit himself. As they entered the cabin door, my friend, with an air of conscious triumph, turned to direct our attention to his champion, when he discovered the fellow trying to insure success by making up faces.</p>

"He was, but he wasn't a propergander, nor an oilygarchist, or an avaritionist, nor a demigod, as some of 'em are, all he wanted was an exercise of his sufferings and the use of his elective French eyes as he used to say. Ah, Heaven rest him!" exclaimed she, as her eyes rose from the period at the bottom of the bill and rested on the top of the fence. "But did he never get an office, Mrs. P?" we asked. "Yes," replied she, and we fancied the tone of her voice had an expression of triumph in it—enough to be perceptible, like three drops of paregoric in a teaspoonful of water,—"Yes, he was put one year for a hogreefer and got neglected." As we were about asking her opinion of the new constitution, Ike came along whistling "Jordan," and swinging a pint of milk in a tin pail, around his head, and the old lady forgot her politics in her solicitude about Ike's soiling his new cap.</p>

So, several days the leg of mutton came obedient to the mistress's order. Perhaps, the cook was weary of it; at last she ventured to inquire, "Should you not like some other thing to-day, ma'am?" "Yes, let us have a leg of beef, for change."</p>

               <p>—An English lady resident at Coblentz, one day wishing to order of her German servant (who did not understand English) a boiled fowl for dinner, Grettel was summoned, and that experiment began. It was one of the lady's fancies, that the less her words resembled her native tongue, the more they must be like German. So her first attempt was to tell the maid that she wanted a cheeking or keeking. The maid opened her eyes and mouth, and shook her head. "It's to cook," said the mistress, "to cook, to put in an iron thing, in a pit, pat, pot." "Ish understand risht," said the maid, in her Coblentz <foreign xml:lang="FRA">patois.</foreign> "It's a thing to eat," said her mistress, "for dinner—for deener—with sauce, soace, sowose. What on earth am I to do?" exclaimed the lady in despair, but still made another attempt. "It's a little creature—a bird—a bard—a beard—a hen—a hone—a fowl—a fool; it's all covered with feathers—fathers—feeders!" "Ha, ha," cried the delighted German, at last getting hold of a catchword, "Ja, ja! fedders—ja wohl!" and away went Grettel, and in half an hour returned, triumphantly, with a bundle of stationer's quills.</p>

               <head>BECOMING A MEDIUM.</head>
               <p>—The fascinating spiritual rapping is without a doubt gaining strength among us, and some very ludicrous incidents often grow out of it at times, as well as more serious and deplorable ones.</p>
               <p>A few nights since, within this week, a young male friend of ours, who from a sneering skeptic had become a devout believer, retired to rest, after having his nervous system partially destroyed by the information, through the spirit of his grandfather, that he would very soon become a powerful medium. He was in his first comfortable snooze when a clicking noise in the direction of the door awoke him. He listened intently; the noise was still going on—very like the raps of the spirits on the table, indeed!</p>
               <p>"Who is there?"</p>
               <p>There was no answer, and the queer noise stopped.</p>
               <p>"Anybody there?"</p>
               <p>No answer.</p>
               <p>"It must have been a spirit," he said to himself. "I must be a medium. I'll try. (Aloud.) If there is a spirit in the room it will signify the same by saying 'aye'—no, that's not what I mean. If there is a spirit in the room, will it please rap three times?"</p>
               <p>Three very distinct raps were given in the direction of the bureau.</p>
               <p>"Is it the spirit of my sister?"</p>
               <p>No answer.</p>
               <p>"Is it the spirit of my mother?"</p>
               <p>Three taps.</p>
               <p>"Are you happy?"</p>
               <p>Nine taps.</p>
               <p>"Shall I hear from you to morrow?"</p>
               <p>Raps very loud again; this time in the direction of the door.</p>
               <p>"Shall I ever see you?"</p>
               <p>The raps then came from the outside of the door. He waited<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC5683-00000118"/> long for an answer to his last question, but none came. The spirit had gone; and after thinking on the extraordinary visit, he turned over and fell asleep.</p>
               <p>On getting up in the morning, he found that the spirit of his mother had carried off his watch and purse, his pants down stairs into the hall, and his great coat altogether.</p>

               <head>OLD JESTS.</head>
               <p>—Persons who gloat over dust and black-letter need scarcely be told that the best of "modern" jests are almost literally from the antique: in short, that what we employ to "set the table in a roar" were employed by the wise men of old to enliven <emph>their</emph> cups, deep and strong; that to jest was a part of the Platonic philosophy; and that the excellent fancies, the flashes of merriment, of our forefathers, are nightly, nay, hourly re-echoed for our amusement. Yet such is the whole art of pleasing: what has pleased will, with certain modifications, continue to please again and again, until the end of time.</p>
               <p>A speculative gentleman, wishing to teach his horse to do without food, starved him to death. "I had a great loss," said he; "for, just as he learned to live without eating, he died."</p>

               <p>A robustious countryman meeting a physician, ran to hide behind a wall; being asked the cause, he replied, "It is so long since I have been sick, that I am ashamed to look a physician in the face."</p>
               <p>A gentleman had a cask of Aminean wine, from which his servant stole a large quantity. When the master perceived the deficiency, he diligently inspected the top of the cask, but could find no traces of an opening. "Look if there be not a hole in the bottom," said a bystander. "Blockhead!" he replied, "do you not see that the deficiency is at the top, and not at the bottom?"</p>
               <p>A young man meeting an acquaintance, said, "I heard that you were dead." "But," says the other, "you see me alive." "I do not know how that may be," replied he: "you are a notorious liar; but my informant was a person of credit."</p>
               <p>A man hearing that a raven would live two hundred years, bought one to try.</p>
               <p>A man wrote to his friend in Greece, begging him to purchase books. From negligence or avarice, he neglected to execute the commission; but fearing that his correspondent might be offended, he exclaimed, when next they met, "My dear friend, I never got the letter you wrote to me about the books."</p>
               <p>A wittol, a barber, and a bald-headed man travelled together. Loosing their way, they were forced to sleep in the open air; and, to avert danger, it was agreed to keep watch by turns. The lot first fell on the barber, who for amusement, shaved the fool's head while he slept; he then woke him, and the fool, raising his hand to scratch his head, exclaimed, "Here's a pretty mistake; rascal! you have waked the bald-headed man instead of me."</p>
               <p>A man that had nearly been drowned while bathing, declared that he would not again go into the water until he had learned to swim.</p>
               <p>A fellow had to cross a river, and entered a boat on horseback; being asked the cause, he replied, "I must ride, because I am in a hurry."</p>
               <p>A student in want of money sold his books, and wrote home, "Father, rejoice, for I now derive my support from literature."</p>
               <p>Written agreements should be drawn up as shortly as possible; for parties are sure to agree best between whom there are the fewest words.</p>

               <head>THE CAPTAIN'S STORY.</head>
               <p>—Some twenty years ago, I was coming from Calcutta, in a good ship I then commanded; I had been away from home eleven months, during which time I had heard no news thence, either private or public. Off Barnegat, we fell in with a fishing smack, having on board a man and a boy, father and son. We wanted some fresh fish, and the father coming on board, we soon made a bargain with him, receiving in exchange for a real Indian bandanna handkerchief, a plentiful supply.</p>
               <p>"Well, skipper," said I, after the barter was over, "what's the news?"</p>
               <p>He nodded his head thoughtfully for a moment, and said, "Potatoes is twenty-five cents a bushel!"</p>
               <p>"Is it possible?" I asked, "but the news, what is the <emph>news!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Wal," said he, "there was a great crop on 'em last fall!"</p>
               <p>"Never mind the potatoes," said I, "tell us the news—what's going on in the political world?"</p>
               <p>"Politikal!" said the fisherman, standing silently for a few<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC5683-00000122"/> minutes. "Political? d'ye see that feller in my boat yonder?" pointing to his son, a mop-headed fellow of eighteen, "wal, captin, that are chap made two hundred dollars last winter!"</p>
               <p>There was no use in trying to make anything out of him, so we parted. Three or four years after, on my return from another voyage, coming on the same coast, I again met this fisherman. He remembered me, took the identical bandanna I had given him, waved it, with a cheer, above his head, and swore I should have the best and biggest fish he had. I made another purchase of him, and was again anxious for the news.</p>
               <p>"What's the news?" I inquired, "who's president?"—it was just after a general election.</p>
               <p>Said the fisherman, "D'ye recollect my boy that I had in the smack with me—the one who made two hundred dollars?"</p>

               <p>—One day a doctor of divinity chanced into a hat store in this city, and, after rummaging over the wares, selected an ordinary looking hat, put it on his reverend head, ogled himself in the glass, then asked the very lowest price of it, telling the vendor, that, if he could give it cheap enough, he thought he might buy it. "But," said the hatter, "that hat is not good enough for you to wear—here is what you want," showing one of his best beavers. "'Tis the best I can afford, tho'," returned the theologian. "Well, there, doctor, I'll make you a present of that best beaver, if you'll wear it, and tell your friends whose store it came from; I'll warrant you'll send me customers enough to get my money back with interest: you are pretty extensively acquainted." "Thank you—thank you!" said the doctor, his eyes gleaming with pleasure at raising a castor so cheaply: "how much may this beaver be worth?" "We sell that kind for eight dollars," replied the man of <emph>nap.</emph> "And the other?" continued the reverend gentleman. "Three." The man of sermons put on the beaver, looked in the glass, then at the three-dollar hat. "I think, sir," said he, taking off the beaver, and holding it in one hand, as he donned the cheap "tile," "I think, sir, that this hat will answer my pupose full as well as the best." "But you'd better take the best one, sir, it costs you no more." "Bu-t—bu-t," replied the parson hesitatingly, "I didn't know—but—per-haps—you would as lief I would take the cheap one, and leave the other—and perhaps you would not mind giving me the difference in a <emph>five-dollar bill!</emph>"</p>

               <p>—Abernethy's mind disqualified him from adopting that affected interest which distinguishes many of the well-bred physicians, and he heartily despised their little arts to acquire popularity. He seemed to feel as if he mentally expressed himself thus:—"Here I am, ready to give my advice if you want it; but<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC5683-00000123"/> you must take it as you find it, and if you don't like it, egad (his favorite word,) you may go about your business—I don't want to have anything to do with you; hold your tongue and be off." In some such mood as this he received a visit from a lady one day who was well acquainted with his invincible repugnance to her sex's predominant disposition, and who therefore forbore speaking but simply in reply to his laconic queries. The consultation was conducted during three visits in the following manner:—First Day.—Lady enters and holds out her finger.—Abernethy: "Cut?"—Lady: "Bite." A.: "Dog?"—L: "Parrot." A.: "Go home and poultice it." Second day.—Finger held out again.—A.: "Better?"—L: "Worse." A.: "Go home and poultice it again." Third Day.—Finger held out as before.—A.: "Better?"—L.: "Well." A.: "You're the most sensible wom an lever met with. Good bye. Get out."</p>
               <p>Another lady, having scalded her arm, called at the usual hour to show it three successive days, when similar laconic conversations took place. First day—Patient exposing the arm, says—"Burnt."—A.: "I see it," and having prescribed a lotion, she departs. Second day—Patient shows the arm, and says—"Better."—A.: "I know it." Third Day—again showing the arm. Patient: "Well."—A.: "Any fool can tell that. What d'ye come again for? Get away."</p>
               <p>A loquacious lady, ill of a complaint of forty years' standing, applied to him for advice, and had begun to describe its progress from the first, when Mr. A. interrupted her, saying he wanted to go into the next street, to see a patient; he begged the lady to inform him how long it would take her to tell her story. The answer was, twenty minutes. He asked her to proceed, and hoped she would endeavor to finish by the time he returned.</p>

               <p>—Old Hicks was an awful snorer. He could be heard farther than a blacksmith's forge; but his wife became so accustomed to it that it soothed her repose. They were a very domestic couple—never slept apart for many years. At length, the old man was required to attend assizes at some distance. The first night after his departure, his wife never slept a wink; she missed the snoring. The second night passed away in the same manner, without sleep. She was getting into a very bad way, and probably would have died, had it not been for the ingenuity of a servant-girl. She took the <emph>coffee-mill into her mistress' chamber, and-ground her to sleep at once!</emph>

               <p>—An English lady, who lived in the country, and was about to have a large dinner party, was ambitious of making as great a display as her husband's establishment, a tolerably large one, could furnish. So that there might seem to be no lack of servants, a great lad, who had been employed only in farm work, was trimmed and dressed for the occasion, and ordered to take his stand at the back of his mistress' chair, with strict injunctions not to stir from the place, nor do anything, unless she directed him; the lady well knowing, that, although no footman could make a better appearance as a piece of still-life, some awkwardness would be inevitable if he were put in motion. Accordingly, Thomas having thus been duly drilled and repeatedly enjoined, took his post at the head of the table, behind his mistress, and for a while he found sufficient amusement in looking at the grand set-out, and staring at the guests; when he was weary of this, and of an inaction to which he was so little used, his eyes began to pry about nearer objects. It was at a time when our ladies followed the French fashion of having the back and shoulders under the name of the neck, uncovered much lower than accords either with the English climate, or with old English notions; a time when, as Landor expresses it, the usurped dominion of <emph>neck</emph> had extended from the ear downwards almost to where mermaids become fish. This lady was in the height, or lowness of that fashion; and between her shoulder-blades, in the hollow of the back, not far from the confines where nakedness and clothing met, Thomas espied what Pasquier had seen upon the neck of Mademoiselle des Roches. The guests were too much engaged with<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC5683-00000125"/> the business and the courtesies of the table to see what must have been worth seeing, the transfiguration produced in Thomas's countenance by delight, when he saw so fine an opportunity of showing himself attentive, and making himself useful. The lady was too much occupied with her company to feel the flea; but, to her horror, she felt the great finger and thumb of Thomas upon her back, and, to her greater horror, heard him exclaim in exultation, to the still greater amusement of the party, "A vlea! a vlea! my lady. Ecod I've caught 'en!"</p>

               <head>HINTS ON KEEPING THE SABBATH.</head>
               <p>—Some cats are in the habit of mewing when there are birds in the room. This may be tolerated on the ordinary week-days, but must not be permitted on the Sabbath. If the cat be placed in the water-butt on Saturday night, it will be seldom found to disturb a serious family's peace of mind on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Having placed your cat in the water-butt, do not forget that the bird will not be prevented by such an incident from singing. This must not be suffered, if you wish to keep the Sabbath in a proper spirit. Place, therefore, your Swedish Nightingale, or Cockney chaffinch, or whatever the bird you possess may be, in the coal cellar, <figure/> where its singing will not have the effect of disturbing your attention from melancholy subjects. Some birds sing better from being kept in the dark; but as long as the bird's notes do not reach your ears on the Sabbath, you may balance accounts with your conscience in the most satisfactory manner.</p>
               <p>When you have disposed of the dumb animals of your establishment, attend to your children, who must occupy the next place in the minds of virtuous Sabbatarians. It would be a very horrible<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC5683-00000126"/> thing to have a naughty boy in the house on Sunday—crimes being more especially crimes (in the proportion of about 20,017 to 1,) when perpetrated on the seventh day. Thrash your son, then, on Saturday night; and whatever evil actions he may perpetrate the next day, at all events he will have been prepared for the worst. Any brother Sabbatarian will be kind enough to spare you a rod, if you assure him that your object is to spoil your child.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Some Sabbatarians—though their numbers are certainly few—derive pleasure from looking at pictures. If you happen to have any in your house, you must carefully turn their faces against the wall (we were alluding, in the first instance, to the pictures, and our remarks will not apply equally well to the men.) Remember, that the sight of a picture frequently induces thought; and the Sabbath is not the day for your mind to be set working.</p>

               <p>Shut the shutters carefully on Saturday night, and do not reopen them until Monday morning. It is unbecoming to have the light making a shine in the house of a religious man on the Sabbath.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Stop your clocks and watches at twelve on Saturday night. These are sinful inventions; and, if wound up in the usual manner, would pay no more respect to one day than to another. Remember, however, that no hands were ever intended to do work on the Sabbath.</p>

               <p>It will not be essential to lie in bed throughout the whole of Sunday; but if you get up, you must not, under any pretext whatever, have the bed made. Of course you will not think of putting your clothes on, even if you rise; not, however, that the spirit of<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC5683-00000127"/> true religion would prevent you from wrapping the blankets round you. If any one should presume to doubt the correctness of classing the process of getting out of bed, and putting one's clothes on, under the head of "labor," we can adduce the celebrated cases of numerous children, of whom it is stated that there is "the greatest possible work" to get them down in time for breakfast.</p>
               <p>If the shutters do not entirely exclude light from the interior of your house (which, if you are a <emph>very</emph> serious person, you will take care shall be the case) it may be permitted to indulge in a little light reading. Our artist suggests some appropriate works.</p>

"Cut it short, cut it short, I say!" says the gent. "Yes, Sir," says the barber, going on with his story. "Will you cut it short, blast you!" bawls the old gent in a rage.

One Sunday the governor was reading the Bible, when Ez the oldest boy, procured a set of dice, and having spotted all the low sides, so that he could not get less than fifteen, commenced throwing them on a chair. The governor came to a hard word, looked up and saw the game. Then came the following conversation.</p>

At length the fellow seeing the predicament the boy was in, yelled out, as he let drive another ball, "<emph>stand in amongst the pins, if ye don't want to get hit.</emph>"</p>

               <p>—Many years ago an "assault and battery" case came up before a magistrate in western Ohio, in which a lawyer named Ellis was the defendant's counsellor, and Elder Gilruth, a Methodist preacher, was the plaintiff's most important witness.</p>
               <p>"Did I understand you to state, Mr. Gilruth, that you saw the defendant strike the plaintiff?"</p>
               <p>"I know not what you may have understood," replied the witness, "but if my eyes serve me properly, I certainly did witness a manœuvre that would warrant that description."</p>
               <p>"Ah, you saw him strike, then; will you please inform the court how hard a blow was inflicted?"</p>
               <p>The witness looked at the counsel and seemed hesitating. The complacent pettifogger insisted upon a statement.</p>
               <p>"As nearly as I can remember," replied the witness, "the blow was sufficient to knock the plaintiff down!"</p>
               <p>"That is not an explicit answer," said the counsel, somewhat nonplussed by the preacher's coolness. "I wish you to explain to the court, how hard a blow was inflicted by the defendant upon the person of the plaintiff as set forth in the indictment."</p>
               <p>"Shall I answer the gentleman's question?" said Gilruth, turning to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>"As you please," replied the justice.</p>
               <p>"You wish me to give a satisfactory demonstration of the velocity of the blow, which brought the plaintiff to the ground?"</p>
               <p>"I do," said Ellis.</p>
               <p>"Well, then," continued Gilruth, advancing a few steps toward the counsel, "as nearly as my judgment serves me, the blow was about equal to <emph>that!</emph>" at the same instant planting his enormous handful of bones directly between the lawyer's eyes, smashing his spectacles, and prostrating the "unlucky limb of the law" upon the floor.</p>

The sleighing was excellent, and my horse, as if charmed by the scene, was trotting off at a brisk rate, when from some cause he suddenly stopped. On looking for it, I discovered a horse and sleigh, driverless. In the sleigh was a mysterious looking keg, sole master of the premises, and upon looking for the driver, I found that individual by the road side—the keg was evidently master of him as of the sleigh. He was muttering something to himself about a "thundering cold fire," and blaming an imaginary John for not "putting on more wood!" Coming nearer to him, I found that he was sitting upon the snow, his feet through the fence, <emph>warming them at the moon!</emph>

               <p>The lady drew down her veil, and for the remainder of the trip the pair looked mute and quiet.</p>

               <head>SERENADING A SENTIMENTAL YOUNG LADY.</head>
               <p>—In my young days, I was extravagantly fond of attending parties, and was somewhat celebrated for playing the flute; hence it was generally expected, when an invitation was extended, that my flute would accompany me. I visited a splendid party one evening, and was called upon to favor the company with a tune on the flute. I, of course, immediately complied with the request. The company appeared to be delighted, but more particularly so, was a beautiful young lady, who raised her hands and exclaimed that it was beautiful, delightful, &amp;c. I, of course, was highly flattered, and immediately formed a resolution to serenade the young lady on the following night. Previous to leaving the party, I made inquiry respecting her residence. I started the next night, in company with several young friends, and arrived, as I supposed, at the lady's residence, but made a most glorious mistake, by getting under the window of an old Quaker. "Now, boys," said I, "behold the sentimentality of this young lady the moment I strike up The Last Rose of Summer." I struck up, but the window remained closed. The boys smiled.—"Oh," said I, "that is nothing; it would not be in good taste to raise the window on the first air." I next struck up on Old Robbin Gray. Still the window remained closed. The boys snickered, and I felt somewhat flat. "Once more, boys," said I; "and she <emph>must</emph> come." I struck up again—My Love is like the Red, Red Rose. Still there was no demonstration. "Boys," said I; "she's a humbug. Let us sing Home, Sweet Home, and if that don't bring her, we will give her up." We struck up, and as we finished the last line, the window was raised. "That's the ticket, boys," said I; "I knew we would fetch her." But instead of the beautiful young lady, it turned out to be the old Quaker in his nightcap and dressing-gown. "Friend," said he, "thee was singing of thy home—I think thee said thy sweet home—and if I recollect right, thee said there was no place like home; now, if there is no place like home, why don't thee go to thy home? Thee is not wanted here—thee, nor none of thy party. Farewell." We and our hats went home!</p>

               <p>—In one of my solitary piscatorial wanderings, last week, I passed through a meadow in which a couple of juveniles were making hay. One of them left his occupation and came towards the brook where I was fishing. The following remarkably interesting conversation ensued—</p>

               <head>RESOLVING A DIFFICULTY.</head>
               <p>—As the chambermaid of a steamboat upon the Ohio was passing out of the ladies' cabin, an old lady, in a plaintively husky tone, requested her to shut the door, as she had caught such a bad cold at Detroit that she was almost dead. At this moment a very phthsis old lady, occupying a berth near the door, forbade the girl to shut it on account of her shortness of breath.</p>
               <p>"Shut it, or I'll die," squeaked the Detroit lady.</p>
               <p>"Leave it open, or I'll smother to death," gasped the other.</p>
               <p>As the war waxed warm, a wag in the adjoining cabin, thrusting his head from his berth, decided the chambermaid's quandary, by ordering her to "open the door until the Detroit lady dies of her cold—and then close it until the other one smothers to death."</p>

               <p>EXTRACT FROM PUFFER'S LAST WORK IN ADVANCE OF PUBLICATION.—Last Friday night—I am not superstitious, but I never met with a misfortune on any other day—I invited Ariminta to accompany me to Christy's; the dear girl is fond of listening to Christy's band; but, for myself, her voice was all the music I cared to listen to—and she of course accepted. When I called at her residence in the upper part of the city, at half-past seven, I found her all ready, and off we started.</p>
               <p>It was a beautiful night, and with the single exception that it was rather warm, would have been just the one of all others for lovers to promenade in. I never shall forget my feelings as we leisurely walked along towards Mechanic's Hall—how I did revel in all the delights of the first dream of pure love I had ever known!—there was to me but one being in this extensive world, and that being was Ariminta! How I did talk!—I, that on ordinary occasions have not a word to say for myself! I quoted to her some of the most exquisite of Moore's love passages which I had committed to memory—went slightly into the merits of Shakspeare's "Romeo and Juliet" and by the time we reached Broadway I was getting rhapsodically frantic about the pseudo Prince's description of his palace by the Lake of Como—I had got so far as to pour a few lines of it, uttered in the softest tones imaginable, into her ear <q>

               <head>THE SWOOP OF THE NIGHT HAWK.</head>
               <p>—It was the gentle hour of gloaming. The beautiful Isabel had left the parental cot for an evening ramble. Through a green lane, redolent of honeysuckle, she bent her way to an antique wooden bridge, crossing a rivulet that murmured beneath the baronial towers, distant some half a mile from her humbler, but not less happy dwelling.</p>
               <p>A mendicant who was leaning over the bridge, rose as she approached, and in a hoarse voice solicited an alms. Isabel had left her purse at home, or the appeal to her gentle bosom would not perhaps have been made in vain. There was truth, then, in her protestation that she had nothing for the man; but he would not believe it, and she hurried on to escape his importunity, he followed her with the accelerated step and heightened voice so charateristic of the determined and professional beggar.</p>
               <p>At this juncture a youth, emerging from behind a gnarled oak, and armed with a substantial walking cane, suddenly placed himself between the maiden and the vagabond, and authoritatively<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC5683-00000138"/> ordered him to go about his business. The fellow, grumbling, sulkily obeyed.</p>
               <p>The young man, taking off his hat, respectfully made an offer to escort Isabel home, and his services were gratefully accepted. He was tall and dark, wearing a profusion of sable ringlets, with mustachios and a tuft. The moon, which was just then rising over the neighboring castle tower, beamed full upon his acquiline nose, and was reflected in the lustre of his black eye.</p>
               <p>"Beautiful moon!" he exclaimed, addressing the planet. "For ages of ages, on this turbulent world, hast thou shone down, tranquil and serene as now. And thou wilt still shine on, in thine unchangeable calmness, on hopes as yet unformed, on griefs unfelt, on unimagined fears. Thou, oh moon, that smilest on the quiet graves, thou wilt one day smile as peacefully on us, when we are laid in earth, and all our cares forgotten! Is it not so?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes!" answered Isabel, with emotion.</p>
               <p>The youth heaved a long-drawn sigh. "This is a strange meeting," he observed, after a pause. "A few minutes more, and we part—perchance for ever. In the meanwhile, might I entreat a trifling favor, which would render me supremely happy?"</p>
               <p>"Really, sir, I—that is—pray, excuse—I could not, indeed!" stammered Isabel, blushing with an intensity actually visible in the moonlight.</p>
               <p>"Suffer me to imprint but one kiss"—the maiden shrank back—"on that delicate hand," said the stranger.</p>
               <p>"This is indeed a strange request," she replied.</p>
               <p>"It is perhaps romantic. But of late years," he continued, "I have resided in Germany, where the boon which I now venture to crave would be esteemed a life-long happiness. Would you deny so rich a blessing, granted so easily?"</p>
               <p>"To my preserver?—that were indeed ungrateful," Isabel answered. And divesting her little hand of its neat kid glove, she presented it to the stranger, who, kneeling, respectfully raised it to his lips.</p>
               <p>At this moment a wild cry for help proceeded from a coppice not far distant. The stranger started to his feet, holding the hand of Isabel in his own, and clutching it convulsively as he listened to the heart piercing shriek. "Await me for a moment!" he exclaimed: "A fellow-creature in distress! 'Tis the call of duty! I will return immediately! Farewell, beautiful being, for one instant—farewell—farewell!" And bounding over a gate into the adjoining field, he disappeared.</p>
               <p>So had a diamond ring, from Isabel's forefinger. It was the gift of a generous uncle, and worth at least thirty pounds. She never again saw either the stranger or the ring. It is but too probable that the latter was stolen, and that the former was a member of the swell mob.</p>

               <head>RINGING HIM IN.</head>
               <p>—A few weeks since a tall, awkward looking chap, just from the green mountains of Vermont, came on board one of the North River boats at Albany. His curiosity was amazingly excited at once, and he commenced "pecking" as he called it into every nook and corner of the boat. The captain's office, the engine-room, the water closets, the barber's shop, all underwent his inspection; and then he went on deck and stood in amazement at the lever beam, the chimneys and various "fixins," till at last he caught sight of the bell. This was the crowning wonder, and he viewed it from every position, walked around it, got down on his knees and looked up into it, and exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Wall, raly, this beats the bell on our meetin' house a darned sight."</p>
               <p>By this time the attention of the captain and several of the passengers were attracted to this genius.</p>
               <p>"How much would you ask to let a feller ring this bell?"</p>
               <p>"You may ring it for a dollar, sir," said the captain.</p>
               <p>"Wall, it's a bargain, all fair and agreed, and no backing out."</p>
               <p>"It's a bargain, sir," said the captain.</p>
               <p>Our hero went deliberately and brought a seat and took hold of the bell-rope, and having arranged everything to his satisfaction, commenced ringing slowly at first, and gradually faster and faster, till everybody on board thought the boat on fire, and rushed on deck screaming with alarm.</p>
               <p>There stood the captain, and there stood the "Monster," ringing away first slow and then fast, and then two or three taps at a time.</p>
               <p>The passengers began to expostulate; the captain said it was a bargain. But the passengers became urgent that the eternal clangor should be stopped.</p>
               <p>All the while there sat our hero undisturbed ringing away more ways than a cockney chime-ringer ever dreamt of.</p>
               <p>At last the captain began to think it time to stop the simpleton; but his answer was:</p>
               <p>"A fair bargain and no backing out."</p>
               <p>And he rang away for dear life.</p>
               <p>"Well," says the captain, "what will you take to stop?'</p>
               <p>"Wall, cap'n, I gess I sheant lose nothing if I take five dollars and a <emph>free passage</emph> to New York, but not a darned cent less."</p>
               <p>"Well, walk down to the office and get your money and passage ticket," said the captain.</p>

"The Dr. tells me that poor old Mrs. Haze has got two buckles on her lungs! It is dreadful to think of, I declare. The diseases is <emph>so</emph> various! one way we hear of people's dying of hermitage of the lungs, another way of the brown creatures; here they tell us of the elementary canal being out of order, and there about tonsors of the throat; here we hear of neurology in the head, there of an embargo; one side of us we hear of men being killed by getting a pound of tough beef in the sarcofagus, and there another kills himself by discovering his jocular vein. Things change so, that I declare I don't know how to subscribe for any disease now-a-days. New names and new nostrils takes the place of the old, and I might as well throw my old herb bag away." Fifteen minutes afterwards Isaac had that herb bag full of Fire<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC5683-00000140"/> Crackers, and was keeping the fourth of July in a patriotic manner by suddenly introducing a lighted pack of those quiet articles, on the table of Dr. Bolus, producing great delight to Isaac, and great consternation to the young Bolusses.</p>

               <head>UNCLE BILL'S FIRST LOVE.</head>
               <p>—My Uncle Bill and my Aunt Airy reside on Long Island, and not far from the far-famed resort, Rockaway. One evening last week, as Aunt Airy was boiling chestnuts for us "Yorkers" to eat, and as Uncle Bill sat smoking a good Havana we had brought down with us, we persuaded him to tell us a story. Uncle Bill tells a good one when he chooses, and being a man that loves to please, he dipped deeply very quickly, into the merits of the one he proposed telling, somewhat thus:—</p>
               <p>"When I was a slip of a chap, I had occasion to travel some distance in a stage-coach, as steamboats and rail-cars were not so plenty in those days. Now I had heard tell often of fellers fallin' in love at first sight, but I never much believed it till that stage made me kinder think so. I had the luck of sitting along side of one of the prettiest women I have ever seen. (Uncle Bill looked slily at Aunt Airy.)</p>
               <p>I soon fell in love up to the brim, chuck, with the gal. As it was growin' dark, the stage was passin' through a thick wood, then I thought my time was come surely. As I felt my strength<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC5683-00000143"/> goin quickly, I kinder gently lifted up my arm and drew it round the fair one's waist; she moved not, but only made a slight noise, which I supposed was a love sigh: says I, dear one, sweet one, I love yer, will yer love me? The girl said nothin', but made what I supposed was a love sigh agin'. I then pressed her to me, her head fell on my shoulder, and I began to tremble all over; but still I kept my tongue agoin', and says I, dear little one, won't yer love me, can't yer love me, will yer love me, will yer <emph>marry</emph> me? The stage then drove out of the woods, and the moon shone on her face, and I looked on it—and—and—"</p>
               <p>"And what?" we all exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"And," says Uncle Bill, "she was <emph>sleepin</emph>' and snorin' in my arms!"</p>
               <p>When our roars of laughter had somewhat subsided, Uncle Bill said—"There she sits, bilin' chestnuts."</p>

               <p>—We remember hearing a story of a fellow who roused a venerable doctor, about twelve o'clock one winter's night, and, on his coming to the door, coolly inquired, "Have you lost a knife, Mr. Brown?" "No," growled the victim. "Well, never mind," said the wag, "I thought I'd just call and inquire, for I found one yesterday." We thought that rather cool; but the following story of Neil M'Kinnon, a New-York wag, surpasses in impudence anything within recollection. Read and speak for yourself, gentle reader:—When the celebrated "Copenhagen Jackson" was British Minister in America, he resided in New-York, and occupied a house in Broadway, Neil, one night at a late hour, in company with a bevy of rough-riders, while passing the house, noticed that it was brillantly illuminated, and that several carriages were waiting at the door. "Holloa!" said our wag, "what's going on at Jackson's?" One of the party remarked that Jackson had a party that evening. "What!" exclaimed Neil, "Jackson have a party, and I not invited? I must see to that!" So, stepping up to the door, he gave a ring, which soon brought the servant to the door. "I want to see the British Minister," said Neil. "You must call some other time," said the servant, "for he is now engaged at a game of whist, and must not be disturbed." "Don't talk to me that way," said M'Kinnon, "but go directly, and tell the British Minister that I must see him immediately on special business." The servant obeyed, and delivered his message in so impressive a style as to bring Mr. Jackson to the door forthwith. "Well," said Mr. Jackson, "what can be your business at this time of night, which is so very urgent?" "Are you Mr. Jackson?" "Yes, sir, I am Mr. Jackson." "The British Minister?" "Yes, sir." "You have a party here to-night, I perceive, Mr. Jackson?" "Yes, sir, I have a party." "A large party, I presume?" "Yes, sir, a large party." "Playing cards, I understand?" "Yes, sir, playing cards." "Oh, well," said Neil, "as I was passing, I merely called to inquire <emph>what's trumps?</emph>"</p>

Henry Snyder was subject to fits of derangement, but they were not of such a nature as to render him dangerous to any one. He merely conceived himself to be the Supreme Ruler of the Universe, and while under the infatuation, had himself a throne built, on which he sat to try the cause of all who offended him; and passed them off to heaven or hell, as his humor prompted—he personating both judge and culprit.</p>
               <p>It happened one day that some difficulty occurred between Henry Snyder and the Fulwilers, on account of their mills; when to be avenged, Henry Snyder took along with him a book in which he recorded his judgment, and mounted his throne to try their<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC5683-00000145"/> causes. He was heard to pass the following judgment. Having prepared himself, (acting as judge, and yet responding for the accused,) he called George Fulwiler.</p>

               <head>THE FAMILY OPPOSED TO TAKING NEWSPAPERS.</head>
               <p>—The man that don't take a city paper was in town yesterday. He brought his whole family in a two horse wagon. He still believed that General Taylor was President, and wanted to know if the "Kamschatkians" had taken Cuba, and if so, where they had taken it. He had sold his corn for twenty-five cents—the price being thirty-one—upon going to deposite the money, they told him it was mostly counterfeit. The only hard money he had was some three cent pieces, and those some sharpers had "run on him" for half dimes! His old lady smoked a "cob pipe," and would not believe that anything else could be used. One of the boys went to a blacksmith's shop to be measured for a pair of shoes, another mistook the market house for a church. After hanging his hat on a meat<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC5683-00000146"/> hook, he piously took a seat on a butcher's stall, and listened to an auctioneer, whom he took to be the preacher. He left before "meetin' was out" and had no great opinion of the sarmint. One of the girls took a lot of "seed onions" to the post office to trade them for a letter. She had a baby, which she carried in a "sugar trough," stopping at times to rock it on the side walk—when it cried, she stuffed its mouth with an old stocking, and sang "Barbara Allen." The oldest boy had sold two "coon skins," and was on a "bust." When last seen, he had called for a glass of "sody and water," and stood soaking gingerbread and making wry faces. The shop keeper, mistaking his meaning, had given him a mixture of sal soda and water, and it tasted strongly of soap. But "he'd hearn tell of sody and water, and was bound to give it a fair trial, puke or no puke." Some "city feller" came in and called for lemonade with a "fly in it," whereupon our "soaped" friend turned his back and quietly wiped several flies into his drink. We approached the old gentleman and tried to get him to "subscribe," but he would not listen to it. He was opposed to "internal improvements," and he thought "larnin' was a wicked invention, and culterwaten' nothin' but wanity and wexation." None of his family ever learned to read, but one boy, and he "teached school awhile and then went to studying diwinity."</p>

               <p>"—<hi rend="i"/>Extract from the Journal of a Vermont Schoolmaster.—Monday.—Went to board at Mr. Banks; had a baked goose for dinner; supposed from its size, the thickness of its skin, and other venerable appearances, to have been one of the first settlers of Vermont—made a slight impression on the patriarch's breast. <hi rend="i"/>Supper.—Cold goose and potatoes; family consisting of the man, good wife, daughter Peggy, four boys, Pompey the dog, and a brace of cats—fire built in the square room about nine o'clock, and a pile of wood lay by the fire-place; saw Peggy scratch her fingers, and couldn't take the hint—felt squeamish about the stomach, and talked about going to bed; Peggy looked sullen, and put out the fire in the square room; went to bed, and dreamed of having eaten a quantity of stone wall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Tuesday.—Cold gander for breakfast, swamp tea, and some nut-cakes; the latter some consolation. <hi rend="i"/>Dinner.—The legs, &amp;c., of the gander done up warm—one neatly despatched. <hi rend="i"/>Supper.—The other leg, &amp;c., cold; went to bed as Peggy was carying the fire to the square room—dreamed I was a mud turtle, had got on my back, and could not get over again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Wednesday.—Cold gander for breakfast; complained of sickness, and could eat nothing. <hi rend="i"/>Dinner.—Wings, &amp;c., of the gander warmed up; did my best to destroy them, for fear they should be left for supper; did not succeed; dreaded supper all the afternoon. <hi rend="i"/>Supper.—Hot Indian Johnny cakes, and no goose; felt greatly relieved, thought I had got clear of the gander, and went to bed for a good night's rest; disappointed; very cold night, and couldn't keep warm in bed; got up, and stopped the broken window with my coat and vest; no use; froze the tip of my nose before morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Thursday.—Breakfast; cold gander again; felt very much discouraged to see the cold gander but half gone; went a visiting for dinner and supper; slept abroad, and had pleasant dreams.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Friday.—Breakfast abroad. Dinner at Mr. Banks; cold gander and hot potatoes; last very good, ate three, and went to school<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC5683-00000147"/> quite contented. <hi rend="i"/>Supper.—Cold gander, no potatoes; bread heavy and dry; had the headache, and couldn't eat; Peggy much concerned; had a fire built in the open square room, and thought she and I had better sit there out of the noise; went to bed early; Peggy thought too much sleep bad for the headache.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Saturday.—Breakfast; cold gander and hot Indian Johnny cake; did very well; glad to come off so. <hi rend="i"/>Dinner.—Cold gander again; didn't keep school this afternoon; weighed, and found I had lost six pounds the past week; grew alarmed; had a talk with Mr. B., and concluded I had boarded out his share.</p>

               <head>THE HIT PALPABLE.</head>
               <p>—Some time since, a traveller stepped into a bank located in a village in the neighborhood of this city, and, immediately after his entrance, pulled off his hat, coat, and cravat; this done, he cast a look at the cashier, who was seated in a corner, "calm as a summer's morning," and, with a commanding shake of his head, said, "Sir, hadn't you better be gettin' that 'ere water heated?" The teller informed him that he was in the wrong "shop." "You are in a bank, sir, not in a barber's shop." "A bank, eh!" ejaculated the stranger, "dang me, they told me it was a shaving shop."</p>

               <p>—"We have got a new venerator on our meeting-house," said Mrs. Partington, "but how on airth they can contrive to climb up there to let the execrations go out is more than I can see into. But it is sich a nice intervention for keeping a house warm!" "What sort of a ventilator is it?" asked we, anxious to get an inkling of the old lady's philosophy. "It is one of the Emissary's," replied she, sagely, "and it is ever so much better than Professor Epsom's, because a room is kept so warm and comfortable by it—not the least danger of taking cold from draughts of too fresh air. It will be a great accusation in cold weather."</p>

               <p>"Ye see, I went down to town to attend some chores, when I seen a whole regiment of fellers, with big paddles on their shoulders, with 'Opperer and All-boney to-night.' Now, I'd heard a great deal about the singin and fiddlin, so I thought I'd go. Well, I was a walkin along into the Opperer, when a feller sung out, 'This way, sir—your ticket, sir.'</p>

               <p>Well, the people snickered, and the feller never said a word, but got hold of another chap and stuck him into 700. Byme-by the big fiddle went ahead like sawin boards, and a feller got hold of something like the old dinner-horn at home and then another little feller with a stick, commenced to cut flab-dabs in the air, jest as if he was keepin a swarm of bees off him—then I heard a bell ring, and all at once the big painting commenced to go up. Well, I seen that much, when I'm darned if I didn't think I was a goner, for there sot one of the puttiest gals I ever did see, right back of me lookin through one of them young double barreled spy-glasses right into my face. I'm conflusticated if I wasn't skeered, for everybody was takin aim at each other, and I was in range of every one—the darned pokerish lookin things, I didn't know anythin about 'em—they might have gone off! Well, the consequence was, I didn't see anythin of All-boney, but heard a devil of a rumpus in the back room of the theatre, and then the people cheered and I sloped."</p>

               <p>—We were once asked, "What would be the consequence if an irresistible force should come in contact with an immovable body?" We handed the problem to Mrs. Partington, who took several pinches of snuff before she gave her opinion. "My idee about it is," said the old lady, and there was an expression as profound as could be worn by the whole faculty of Harvard College, "my idee about it is, that one or t'other of 'em must get hurt!"</p>

               <p>"What kind is these new patterned lamps;" asked Mrs. Partington of a Washington-street dealer. "They are for burning spirit gas, marm." "Well," said the old lady, "if they aint reliable to bust, I'll take a pair. Oh, I never got over the fright I had when Isaac sot the spirit of turpitude afire. We came very near having a serious congregation, and I have never dared to let him go by the oil-feeder after lamplight sence, for fear he'd get burnt. Now this is a great blessedness—this what's-its-name patterned to prevent bustin—and everybody that is in danger of bustin should buy one." She here went out, like an exhausted lamp, and the dealer sent her home a pair of 'em, and visitors were long pleased to hear the expositions of Mrs. P. of the merits of the new invention.</p>

               <head>ISAAC "KETCHED."</head>
               <p>—"Your plants are most flagrantly odious," said Mrs. Partington, as she stooped over a small oval red table in a neighbor's house, which table was covered with cracked pots filled with luxuriant geraniums, and a monthly rose, and a cactus, and other bright creations that shed their sweetness upon the almost tropical atmosphere of a southerly room in April, while a<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC5683-00000149"/> fragrant vine hung in chains graced the window with a curtain more gorgeous than any other not exactly like it. Mrs. Partington stood gazing upon them in admiration. "How beautiful they are," she continued; "do you profligate your plants by slips, mem?" She was told that such was the case; they were propagated by slips. "So was mine," said Mrs. P., "I was always more lucky with my slips than with anything else." At that moment a loud scream was heard in the adjoining Piazza—it comes from the innocent boy Isaac: he had been playing with the Parrot with a bunch of cherries, the game of "don't you wish you might get them." Poll missed the cherries but caught Ike's knuckles—"that boy always was in diffenculties."</p>

               <head>KISSING PHILOSOPHY.</head>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>—<hi rend="i"/>The Naturalist—A kiss is the bringing into juxtaposition two contrarily charged poles by which it, like an electric spark, is elicited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>The Moralist—A kiss is a token of most intimate communion of love, and is therefore only to be permitted in the married.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>The Physician—A kiss is the art of moving the labial muscles when the lips are first brought suddenly together, and then explosively separated; so that after all a kiss is only an artificial spasm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>The Philologist.—Kiss is an anatomo-poetic word in which the curtness of the thing is represented by the brief sound of the word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>The Antiquarian.—Kissing is a custom handed down to us from the Greeks and Romans, as to the true signification of which we are not perfectly clear. Probably it is a symbol of the sun's rays greeting the earth; and if so, doubtless was received with all the other lore of sun worship from the orientals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>The Philosopher.—A kiss is that protruding the circle of the lips, whereby the quantitive difference of the sine of another, and thereby the identity of the subject abject with the ideal real, is proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>The Punster—A kiss [kuss] is the gush [guss] of one soul to another. The pressure of the lemon into the insipid beverage of life. This pressure is the expression of the impression with which no censorship can interfere. We will still have "freedom of the press."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>The Lawyer—The kiss is a nullity in law, being neither a right <foreign xml:lang="LAT">in posse</foreign> nor a right <foreign xml:lang="LAT">in essse.</foreign> Some, however, have considered it as a family right, and would treat it after the analogy of the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">dos.</foreign>
                  <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC5683-00000150"/> But, "L. 74 D. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">de dot constit.</foreign>" does not treat of the kiss at any length. Still, in the married state, we may venture to consider a kiss in the lights of a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">donatio inter vivos.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>

               <head>FASTIDIOUS TASTE.</head>
               <p>—An amusing little incident occurred at a city hotel a few days ago. A verdant looking chap sat down to take "some fillin," as the immortal Joe Lawson would say, and in due time a waiter presented himself at the back of our hero's chair and inquired:</p>
               <p>"Tea or coffee, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Tea," he answered.</p>
               <p>"What kind of tea, sir?"</p>
               <p>Greeny looked up in the waiter's face, and, with considerable emphasis, said:</p>

"I've just come from New-York, and I've seen twice as much as ever I saw in Bosting. I saw the Rochester rappins at a hotel there. The man was a rappin away at the bar and there was all sorts of spirits behind the counter. But Mr. Jones and I went to the Theatre, and that beat all. We saw them performerate a moral brama; Mr. Jones said it was called "Just as you like it."—One part of it they called "Spoke-shave seven edges," and it was the best part of the whole brama, I think. A man they called Jake spoke it, and I'll tell you all about it, for it made such an expression upon me that I learned it all by heart.</p>
