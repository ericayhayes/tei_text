CHAPTER I.&#xD;
PETER      nUT.&#xD;
The balmy winds of the Sea Islands went rip-&#xD;
pling across the green belts of intervening water&#xD;
to the main land, breathing blandly on plan-'&#xD;
tations of cotton and swamps of rice, break-&#xD;
ing, finally, in Ianguid'waves on a far-stretch-&#xD;
ing, barren shore of pine woods, in the narrow,&#xD;
irregular openings of which"Haight be seen&#xD;
scattered, at varying distances, the ill-construct-&#xD;
ed huts of thriftless whites, whose indolent, vag-&#xD;
abond habits form a peculiar and distinctive&#xD;
feature of Southern life.&#xD;
At a certain point in the foreground of this&#xD;
pine belt, between it and the sea, stood, at the'&#xD;
beginning of the civil war, the humble cabin of&#xD;
one Peter Rust, known for his eeeentricities and'&#xD;
wandering propensities all along the tide-water&#xD;
section, from Beaufort to Lake Desmniond, and&#xD;
whose means of existence was a subject of mys-&#xD;
tery and speculation. To some, he was knows&#xD;
as a wood-chopper ; to others, as a still-hunter';&#xD;
procuring the simple necessities of life by lopg&#xD;
and silent tramps in the barrens, ranging at in-&#xD;
tervals, when' it suited his mood, the entire&#xD;
coast- to the distant Alleghanies ; while there&#xD;
were a few poor whites who shook their torpid&#xD;
~1ads atnd hinted at darker game, and a more&#xD;
lucrative pursuit.&#xD;
Although Peter had a dwelling at the some-&#xD;
what ambiguous place we have named, it was&#xD;
.persistently affirmed by the suspicious and idle&#xD;
that be had other-haunts, and, despite his seem-&#xD;
ing loneliness, comrades and accomplices in the&#xD;
obscurities of the forest. Not choosing to as-&#xD;
sociate with the, lazy and the lawless, and keep-&#xD;
ing strictly 'his own' company, he made' ene-&#xD;
mies of those who, under any circumstances,&#xD;
would scarcely have made good . friends and&#xD;
trust companions.&#xD;
When the South arose in flaming wrath to&#xD;
welcome her Northern nei hbors. " with bloody&#xD;
&#xD;
hands to hospitable graves," Peter Rust was a&#xD;
marked man ; and none so hard upon. him as&#xD;
those butted drones who had nothing to lose&#xD;
in the game of war.&#xD;
Within easy eye-range of Peter's modest cab-&#xD;
in, rising on the crest of a graceful -swell, was a&#xD;
mansion of unusual size and architecture. This&#xD;
habitation, though built in a land of beauty&#xD;
and visited by soft, southern suns, had nothing&#xD;
warm and cheerful in its outward aspects, and&#xD;
repelled rather than invited the approaches of&#xD;
the curious. It was 'surrounded by a village of&#xD;
negro huts, which swarmed with life of every&#xD;
hue, from the eighth drop of the octoroon to&#xD;
the full quota of the genuine black.&#xD;
One morning, Peter Rust sat at his cabin-&#xD;
door, cleaning his double gun, when a man,&#xD;
whom he had seen more than once lolling in&#xD;
the sun near a smoky shanty in one of the pine&#xD;
openings in the vicinity, swaggered up to him&#xD;
with an air of importance that had much na-&#xD;
tive impudence in it." Peter aid npt notice his&#xD;
coming iI any perceptible manner. The per-&#xD;
son, after staring at him a moment, opened a&#xD;
mouth that extended from cheek to cheek, and&#xD;
said, between a grunt and a growl, pointing to&#xD;
the large dwelling on the slope :&#xD;
"Wanted oer yon!"&#xD;
Which ?" said Peter, carelessly, contriving&#xD;
to squirt some black water'from the vent of his&#xD;
gun into the nMan'sa ee.&#xD;
"Wanted up to Lowenthal's," he answered,&#xD;
wiping the sooty liquid from his face with the&#xD;
back of a hand that was a stranger to the uses&#xD;
of water.&#xD;
" What's the handle to sich a tyke as you&#xD;
be ?" asked Peter, pouring more water into the&#xD;
barrels,'&#xD;
. The fellow scowled and juarled at this easy&#xD;
style of address.&#xD;
"If you mean my name, it's Ben Dykes.&#xD;
Ben Dykes, of the pine openin's. Ben Dykes,&#xD;
of the turpentine woods. Ben Dykes, the longg&#xD;

Ben Dykes here, and Ben Dykes there."&#xD;
" What a useful bein' you must be !" respond-&#xD;
ed Peter, aiming another jet of water at Ben&#xD;
Dykes' other eye. He squared off,'and mutter-&#xD;
ed:&#xD;
"Don't squirt no more o' that yer, mister !"&#xD;
Peter laid his twin barrels across his knees,&#xD;
and stared at Ben's mouth about long enough&#xD;
to boil an egg. He shook his head gravely.&#xD;
"Wonder it hadn't took your life," he said.&#xD;
" Wonder what hadn't took my life ?" asked&#xD;
Ben, sulienly.,&#xD;
"If it had gone an in h further, 'twould took&#xD;
your head off!" continued Peter, with increas-&#xD;
ng seriousness.        -&#xD;
"What took my head off ?" growled Ben.&#xD;
" How did it happen ?" added Peter, impree-&#xD;
sively,.&#xD;
" What happen, you slow-spoken pup?" yell-&#xD;
ed Ben, losing all patience.&#xD;
" Why, that gash under your nose. Hardly&#xD;
left enough for a hinge for the top to turn on-.-&#xD;
did it?"&#xD;
" G'long, you lank, slap-sided, lathy-legged,&#xD;
lantern-jawed, bob-tailed setter!  Thar 1 take&#xD;
that!"&#xD;
Ben Dykes drew in a column of air that&#xD;
reached to the bottom of his tattered trowsers.&#xD;
" One o' the white trash, a'n't ye, Ben ?"&#xD;
queried Peter, again turning to his work.&#xD;
"«Better run back to your pups, hadn't ye ?&#xD;
Some o' them nigger-dogs that you're training'&#xD;
of may want ye. It must be interestin' to spend&#xD;
your time 'mong p'inters, blooders, and bull-&#xD;
pups !"'&#xD;
Peter threw enough cool contempt into' his&#xD;
voice to provoke Ben to his fighting temper.&#xD;
" I don't mind your fling at the dogs,'. he re-&#xD;
torted, hot with anger. "Snap at 'em ag'in, if&#xD;
you want'to. As for my mouth, it's as, natur'&#xD;
made it, and I'd thank ye to keep out on't."&#xD;
"'Twan't an accident, then ?" said Peter,&#xD;
thoughtfully, his eyes wandering as if mechani-&#xD;
cally to the debatable mouth.&#xD;
"If you don't stop, gapin' at me in that ar'&#xD;
way, I'll give ye a gash worth hatin' !" men-&#xD;
aced Ben. "But 'ta'n't my time to quarrel.&#xD;
As I tole ye, yer wanted up to Lowenthal's."&#xD;
"What if I don't choose to go ?" asked Peter&#xD;
Rust, quietly.&#xD;
"aTry it! try it ! Should like to have ye try&#xD;
it'!"&#xD;
Ben Dykes'was gleeful over this.&#xD;
" Tell Lowenthal I'm  no man's man," an-&#xD;
swered Peter, calmly.&#xD;
"ISartin ! Sartin I'll tell him. He'll give it&#xD;
up, Lowenthal will !" He rubbed his two palms.&#xD;
together in a small spasm of satisfaction, and&#xD;
grinned dreadfully.  . t -     -&#xD;
"4Look out there, you Ben Dykes, or the kiv-&#xD;
er of your mouth'll tip back'ards !".cried Pe-&#xD;
ter, warningly.  "'Twould be eur'ous to see&#xD;
&#xD;
your head hangin' on your shoulders, like a co-&#xD;
quettish gal's bonnet in a hot day."&#xD;
A change passed over Ben's face at that mo-&#xD;
ment. It was as if a ray of mischievious light&#xD;
had fallen upon the angry darkness of his ex-&#xD;
pression. He blazed up.with exultation. His&#xD;
visage said, distinctly:&#xD;
"I have you now, Peter!"&#xD;
" Look at me straight, you woo opper."&#xD;
" I'm lookin'," said Peter, whose self-posses-&#xD;
sion seemed never to forsake him.&#xD;
"Say Cotton is. King !" dictated Ben, with&#xD;
imps of malice sitting cross-legged and jubilant&#xD;
in his eyes.&#xD;
"Which ?"-inquired Peter, placidly.&#xD;
"You've got to mouth it !" cried Ben, snap-&#xD;
ping his fingers as netir Peter's nose as he could&#xD;
without hitting it. "Everybody's got to say it&#xD;
that's asked it, and anybody may ask it. .1oll&#xD;
it as a sweet morsel under your tongue, you&#xD;
thin-blooded, weak-kneed Yankee hound! The&#xD;
Shibboleth, Lowenthal calls it, and woe to them&#xD;
yer as can't pronounce it free and yearnest.&#xD;
Come, now; out with it. Here goes! Cotton is&#xD;
King !"&#xD;
"1I do nothin' on compulsion," said Peter,&#xD;
setting the twin barrels carefully on end against&#xD;
the cabin. " I don't keer," he went on, "wheth-&#xD;
er Cotton or Sweet Potaters is king. I'd as-&#xD;
soon it 'twould be one as othere. have which&#xD;
on 'em you like. Let it be Hemp, if you choose,&#xD;
or Flax, for thlat matter. A deal o' difference&#xD;
it'll make to a white trash whose king. As for&#xD;
niggers, you never owned one, and never will.&#xD;
You can lollop round in the sun like a dirt al-&#xD;
ligator, and that's about all you're good for. If&#xD;
you know when you're well-off, you'll take that&#xD;
mouth o' yours to bead-quarters, and let it for a&#xD;
commissary storehouse: it'll shed rain if you&#xD;
keep the kiver down."&#xD;
"If 'twasn't on other folk's business," mutter-&#xD;
ed Ben, drawing a knife from one leg of his tat-&#xD;
tered trowsers," I'd cut yer into l6ng, thin strips&#xD;
and hang you on a pole to dry !"&#xD;
Having cast this possibility at Peter, he&#xD;
stropped his knife on six inches of bare brown,&#xD;
arm.&#xD;
"If I fall afoul of ye," responded P'eter..with&#xD;
a steelish sort of glimmer in his quiet eyes,&#xD;
"you won't know King Cotton from Northern&#xD;
wool. You've got no courage, and you kuow&#xD;
it. Put up your cleaver and be source !'&#xD;
Ben Dykes slowly sheathed his weapon in Iis&#xD;
trowser's leg and backed cautiously away, grim-&#xD;
acing provokingly.             b   i     -&#xD;
"Skedaddle !" cried Peter, rufflied bphis grin-&#xD;
ning diabolism. -"Go to- him as sent ye, and&#xD;
tell him I've my own affairs to mind."&#xD;
Ben performed a series of sinister panto-"&#xD;
mimes, and walked off with as much haste as his&#xD;
lounging habits would allow.&#xD;
Peter Rust-went on with his task in a mopd&#xD;
less, cheerful. He wiped the twin barrels dry&#xD;
&#xD;
MILROSE ; OR, THE COTTON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
and replaced .them in the stock with special&#xD;
care. Ehe gun was a fine piece of workman-&#xD;
ship. The barrels.beautifully finished, and fit-&#xD;
ted to the wood as if they had grown there,&#xD;
were of different weight- and calibre, and for dif-&#xD;
ferent uses ; one being a shot-barrel and the&#xD;
other a rifle. Peter Rust admired the weapon,&#xD;
and seemed never weary of looking at the hair-&#xD;
line-settings of the blue steel mountings, the&#xD;
thorough and flush-edged lock-work, the curli-&#xD;
ness of the sturdy old piece of English walnut,&#xD;
the smoothness of the oil finish, and the sym-'&#xD;
metrical completeness and perfection of the&#xD;
united whole. Dykes had looked at it more&#xD;
than once with covetous eyes.&#xD;
The following evening, while Peter was re-&#xD;
eling, half-asleep, under the branches of one of&#xD;
the line patriarchs at his door, he was surround-&#xD;
ed by a dozen mounted men, and informed that&#xD;
he was a prisoner.&#xD;
"Which?" asked Peter, rising and placing&#xD;
his back to the tree.&#xD;
The-word " prisoner -.was repeated by some&#xD;
one.&#xD;
" Who are ye ?" inquired Peter.&#xD;
" Confederates," answered he who had before&#xD;
spoken.&#xD;
" Confederates !" repeated Peter.  "Two,&#xD;
four, six, eight, ten, twelve.. It only took from&#xD;
twelve to a dozen of ye to take me! And I&#xD;
ain't quite taken yet. I could make a pretty&#xD;
fight, if I's in the mood on't. But don't be&#xD;
afeard. I'll keep the peace as long as you."&#xD;
"Up to Lowenthal's with him !" said a voice&#xD;
that Peter knew very well.&#xD;
" Hillo I" cried Peter. "The man with the&#xD;
hinge j'int on the back of his head, is hereabout.&#xD;
Push him along, so I can see him. Ruther see&#xD;
him than a caravan. In all my still-walkings,&#xD;
up and down, ong and athwart, crossways and&#xD;
lengthways, eoastways and inland, I never run&#xD;
afoul of a eretur with his head cut off, afore."&#xD;
Peter stored in inimitable wonder at Ben&#xD;
Dykes.&#xD;
"Set it over night, and what a eat-trap 'twould&#xD;
make !'&#xD;
The men laughed. Ben muttered some pine&#xD;
barren invocations that were not brotherly.&#xD;
" Thee will come along !" said a large man,&#xD;
who had hitherto remained silent.&#xD;
Peter turned to the speaker instantly. The&#xD;
style of address surprised him..&#xD;
"As there appears to be one decent man&#xD;
apong ye, I'd like to ask that man, if it a'n't&#xD;
takin' too much liberty, who he is, and what's&#xD;
wanted of me ?"&#xD;
I am," answered lie of the plain \language,&#xD;
one Mirtin Broadbent, of whom you may, per-&#xD;
chance, have heard, overseer of this plantation,&#xD;
agent, tool, instrument, and,,as it- were, right-&#xD;
hand of one Roscoe Lowenthal, landholder,&#xD;
slaveholder, householder, gentleman born, gen-&#xD;
tleeman bred, and rightful owner of the ground&#xD;
&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
you stand upon. I am duly commissioned to&#xD;
couduet, convey, transport and carry, one Peter&#xD;
Rust, wherever found, to yonder house on the&#xD;
hill. Beyond this I know not. Dispute my&#xD;
authority, which is derived from said Lowenthal&#xD;
himself, and of a truth I wrill coerce, constrain,&#xD;
force, enforce, and compel thee to go."&#xD;
This avowal was made with a semi-religious&#xD;
earnestness, in singular contrast to the bluster-&#xD;
ing, profane manners of the creatures who sat on&#xD;
their queer horses, squinting at Peter.&#xD;
" Was ever the like heard !" exclaimed Peter.&#xD;
"Was words ever so piled up? Hang that&#xD;
solemn Quaker tongue in Ben Dykes' hoss-shed&#xD;
of a mouth, and there'd be a voice for ye I"&#xD;
"No -more a boss-shed than your own!l"&#xD;
grumbled Dykes.&#xD;
" My time isn't worth nothing, " continued&#xD;
Peter., "Sprinkle some more words out o' your&#xD;
pepper-box, Mr. Broadbent."&#xD;
Peter looked so quizzical, that the lawless&#xD;
crew laughed inconcert. The Quaker, however,&#xD;
retained his gravity, which grew more ponder-&#xD;
ous as the hilarity of his assistants increased.&#xD;
" Is, the name, style, title, and temporal desi&#xD;
nation of thy outward corporality, Peter Rust?"&#xD;
he inquired, with the utmost seriousness.&#xD;
"Which ?" quoth Peter.&#xD;
Martin Broadbent repeated his question with&#xD;
scrupulous precision.&#xD;
"I never denied my name," said -Peter,&#xD;
" though a namesake of mine, once on a time,&#xD;
told a monstrous and cowardly lie."&#xD;
" Then thee will come along."&#xD;
Then to his aids:&#xD;
"If he comes not peaceably, lay violent hands&#xD;
on him, and constrain him with the strong&#xD;
arm."&#xD;
"If I must submit to this unlawful proceed-&#xD;
ing, I'll make a virtue of necessity, and go&#xD;
quietly. But I shall .hold ye, Mr. Overseer,"&#xD;
Peter added, "responsible for this treatment.&#xD;
With your born and bred gentleman I have no&#xD;
business, that I know on, and don't care to have&#xD;
any."&#xD;
Rust cast a wishful look at his cabin, and was&#xD;
pushed and jostled toward Lowenthal's, by hands&#xD;
not over friendly. Ben Dykes lingered, and did&#xD;
not overtake the party for some minutes. Peter&#xD;

CHAPTER IL&#xD;
LOWENTHIAL.&#xD;
While being hurried up the acclivity, he tried&#xD;
to make conversation with Martin Broadbent,&#xD;
but drew nothing satisfactory from him. That&#xD;
a man .of his sober faith should be engaged in&#xD;
such a questionable calling in the- cotton-fields&#xD;
of South Carolina, was to him a subject of&#xD;
astonishment.&#xD;
The evening was considerably advanced when&#xD;
Peter Rust was ushered into the house of Lo'i.&#xD;

&#xD;
enthal. He cold not but notice, as he entered,&#xD;
that the place was much like a military camp.&#xD;
le saw, a little way off, shimmering in the&#xD;
moonlight, a cluster of white tents, recently&#xD;
pitched.&#xD;
Lowenthal was a man between thirty-five and&#xD;
forty years of age, six feet in height, compactly&#xD;
built, features thin and dark, expression hard&#xD;
and keen. Ambition, cunning, and misanthropy,&#xD;
had made their respective writings on his face&#xD;
and character.&#xD;
Martin Broadbent, having conducted hima to&#xD;
this siniister present,- withdrew' without re-&#xD;
mark.&#xD;
Peter Rust was six feet and two inches in&#xD;
height, straight as his owf gun-barrels. ~ He&#xD;
was never more rigidly perpendicular than when&#xD;
Lowenthal was looking him over with his1 cold'&#xD;
eyes. He bore the scrutiny with patient firm-&#xD;
ness. While Lowenthal studied his man, Peter&#xD;
studied his.&#xD;
You were born at the North?" said Lowen-&#xD;
thal, by and by.   '&#xD;
"I might have been born at the South, had&#xD;
my mother been there at the time," answered&#xD;
Peter, dryly.&#xD;
"Keep your Yankee wit till it's wanted," said&#xD;
Lowenthal.&#xD;
"I'll keep it at the door'in calling distance, in&#xD;
ease there should be a demand fo- it. Poor&#xD;
market for it here, I allow," replied Peter.&#xD;
"For the work you're wan led for," resumed&#xD;
Lowenthal, with composure, "Lincolnite, abo-&#xD;
litionist, bloodtub, or -mudsill, are all, one to me.&#xD;
It's not your brains I want but your greasy,&#xD;
mechanical skill."&#xD;
"Go on," said Peter.&#xD;
"I am told," Lowenthal continued," that you&#xD;
can turn your hand to any craft. I have sent&#xD;
for you to put your'aptness touse. You needn't&#xD;
speak. I1,do the talking myself."&#xD;
Lowenthal rang a bell, then taking a revolver&#xD;
from a case, slipped it into a side-pocket.&#xD;
With wonderful quickness there appeared 'a&#xD;
negro of such gigantic proportions, that Peter&#xD;
Rust could do nothing but look 'at him. His&#xD;
body was a great column of flesh that towered&#xD;
ibove his own height like -an ebony' Colossus.&#xD;
His head wasa mass of crispy heir, giving back-&#xD;
round and moral support to an incredible sur-&#xD;
face of face, com ounded of lip and nose, mix-&#xD;
ed with cheek and chin, teeth and eyes, in a'very&#xD;
'African manner. His sooty visage was scarred&#xD;
and hacked in a disagreeable fashion. One of&#xD;
his naked arms was branded--the letters, deeply:&#xD;
printed in fire looking like letters of iron im.&#xD;
bedded in the flesh.&#xD;
"Babel," said Lowenthal, with a wave of the,&#xD;
hand, "light us up."&#xD;
The black, who had obviously been expecting&#xD;
a summons, brought a large lamp which burned&#xD;
with a clear and steady flame, and, without an-&#xD;
swer, obeyed his mascr.&#xD;
&#xD;
Peter followed the giant, and Lowenthal wa.-&#xD;
ed behind, thus placing Peter between the two.&#xD;
He went forward firmly, for his nerves were not&#xD;
easily disturbed.&#xD;
They.ascended a flight of steps in a remote&#xD;
part of the mansion, passed through an upper&#xD;
hall, and finally mounted another staircase.&#xD;
Peter wAs surprised at the capaciousness of the&#xD;
house, which, when viewed from the outside,&#xD;
did not appear 'so spacious. Babel paused at&#xD;
the door of a room just under the roof, which&#xD;
was barely high enough for him to stand erect.&#xD;
With the broad, red flame of the lamp falling&#xD;
on 'his pug-nose, and two banks of 'lips, and the&#xD;
white rims of his eyes, he looked as much like&#xD;
8atan ds anything Peter could think of.&#xD;
" Go ini!' said Lowenthal.&#xD;
Babel shuffled in.&#xD;
Peter crossed the threshold, dubiously, and&#xD;
found himself in an apartment about ten feet by&#xD;
sixteen, having two narrow windows and a 'sky-&#xD;
light ; the latter being so arranged that, by&#xD;
stepping in a chair, a person of ordinary height&#xD;
could reach a looped cord by which it couldbe&#xD;
raised or lowered as ventilationrequired.&#xD;
" You see those windows and the roof-light ?,,&#xD;
said Lowenthal.&#xD;
Peter Rust replied that he did.&#xD;
" Now look to your left. You see these cook&#xD;
joists-don't you ?"&#xD;
" I see 'em," said Peter.&#xD;
"Very well. With those oaken bars you tire&#xD;
to seal u'p those windows, strengthen this dour,&#xD;
-and repair the weak places in the walls."&#xD;
"If I agree to r" muttered Peter.&#xD;
"There is but one. will in this house," con-&#xD;
tinued Lowenthal, hmperiously, "' and that is&#xD;
-mine'!"&#xD;
He made a motion 'to the black, who, placing&#xD;
the lamp in a wooden brackeb went to a little&#xD;
closet that had, till then, 'escaped Peter's no-&#xD;
tice, and thence took a gun, with a short brass&#xD;
barrel and bass mountings. The calibre of&#xD;
this ancient .fire-arm was such that a hand of&#xD;
moderate size might have been thrust in at the&#xD;
muzzle. Under ordinary circumstances, Peter&#xD;
would have smiled at sight of it ; but matters&#xD;
were growing too serious for smiling.&#xD;
" Is it loaded ?" asked Lowenthal, using his&#xD;
right arm as if it were a ramrod.&#xD;
Babel nodded his woolly globe of a head,sand&#xD;
held up four fingers, to signify 'that there were&#xD;
four balls in the blunderbuss. He then; opened&#xD;
the powder-pan, to show that the piece was&#xD;
primedd.&#xD;
Peter lost nothing of this dumb show.&#xD;
"Stand at this door," added Lowenthal, in an&#xD;
even, inflexible voice. " This mnudsill is not to&#xD;
go till the work is done. If he attempts to force&#xD;
his way hence, shoot him.".&#xD;
Peter remarked that as often as Lowenthal&#xD;
addressed the black, he gesticulated in a singu-&#xD;
lar manner, and that Babel kept his eyes stead-&#xD;
&#xD;
fastly fastened on his lips. He .seemed to speak.&#xD;
from the force of hagit, but to gestieulate for&#xD;
the niegro's apprehension.&#xD;
" Is this the way you gesier'ly get .your work-&#xD;
done :" Peter demanded, meeting. the eyes of&#xD;
Lowenhnalgfirmly.&#xD;
The latter po ted '-zthe 1i 'ber ar&amp;amp; ie&#xD;

expression. T was easy to see at.  ad een&#xD;
habitually obeyed. Ba belwithls i$iiriebuss&#xD;
at his shoulder, planted; his- r ea  odmin the'&#xD;
door.                  ..&#xD;
"Work!".saidLoentha.,'&#xD;
"I am no workman." answere&amp;amp;tPeer, caliil .&#xD;
"Most of 'my lite  has been spent'min the w os,,&#xD;
with my gun formy, companion,,a drthe wild-&#xD;
game for .my food. ITknow li1tTbol the arts of&#xD;
common life. You havenade a mistake :about:&#xD;
my handiness, ingenuity, and, all 'tuit:' 'Seein'&#xD;
the whole thing's a blunder, 'Il'go my way and&#xD;
say no more on't."&#xD;
'eter 'Rust watched the, effec'(f' his words,'&#xD;
but they passed over the stern surfaee of Low-&#xD;
enthal like the lightest zepIyr over a frozen&#xD;
lake.  The still-hunter might as wellhave&#xD;
thrown up a window and dropped liis asyer out1&#xD;
out of it.&#xD;
"You're down among the ,nudsls,",answer-&#xD;
ed Lowenthal,.with no apparent increase of im-'&#xD;
patience; -but'the tenor of his voice was bard"&#xD;
as iron. " Never lived drudging  Yankee' that&#xD;
couldn't do whatever was wanted. Hammers&#xD;
and planes, chaffering -and gains, are their nat-&#xD;
ural weapons and aspiations. As their fathers&#xD;
were, so are they. Work !'&#xD;
1 The white hand of the planter went quivering&#xD;
toward the windows again.&#xD;
The cheeks of Peter Rust burned red, at first ;&#xD;
then they paled'slow.ly  Thire was something,&#xD;
like white lightning flickering in his eyes.&#xD;
"I am but a simple-minded man," he said,&#xD;
"and know little more than simple honesty. I&#xD;
s'pose tools and work are 'well enough in their&#xD;
way, but a deal too common for born gentle-&#xD;
men. You people down, here couldn't have&#xD;
housen to live in, if 'twasn't for Northern brains&#xD;
and Northern planes. You'd be obleeged to&#xD;
sleep under the open sky, with your slaves, if&#xD;
you had to trust to your own bone and muscle.&#xD;
But what's bone and muscle? Bone and mus-&#xD;
cle isn't for born gentlemen and born ladies, of&#xD;
course ! Bone and muscle is for niggers and&#xD;
Northern workers !"&#xD;
Peter looked down at the floor, and compress,&#xD;
ed his lips. Ile needed wonderful self-power to,&#xD;
govern his feelings, but he struggled for the vic-&#xD;
tory, and obtained it.&#xD;
Lowenthi1's lip curled scornfully, but he&#xD;
vouchsafed no:other reply. He paused on the&#xD;
threshold, as he passed Babel, and said, touching&#xD;
his lips and his breast:&#xD;
AGive him   neither food nor drink till the&#xD;
work is done. When it is completed, inform me."&#xD;
&#xD;
The giant jerked his head like a great black&#xD;
audton.&#xD;
Pve-no tools,  miuttered Peter&#xD;
,Lowenthal pointed to a chest in the-:loset,&#xD;

Signs were just'the thing. He had talked with&#xD;
Choctaws ,with signs.&#xD;
"I 'have 'him on the hip, now," said Peter,&#xD;
making aloud. I'll talk with this deef and&#xD;
nmhdevil, in spite' of his teeth I"&#xD;
The concluding word of this resolution was&#xD;
suggested by the white glearn-of Babel's masti-&#xD;
cators through the 'reddepths of his. lips. He&#xD;
wanted .to ask him the use of that  m, but&#xD;
when he came to look over his stock opan o-&#xD;
mine, he found it less copious thani he had im.&#xD;
agined. He swept his hanji around the cham-&#xD;
ber, and then aimed a forefinger dead at the&#xD;
giant ; and on his not seeming to understand,.&#xD;
repeated it with the words:&#xD;
"What'll he do with it, you ox?"&#xD;
Babel's head rolled negatively from pdy' tor&#xD;
side.&#xD;
" What a 'fool I" added Peter, in strong dis-&#xD;
gust. "A nat'ral idiot ought to knowed what&#xD;
that meant. If I had a plantation-whip,guess&#xD;
I'd bring him round so he'd know signs! ! Hre&#xD;
I be, shet up with a mammoth ox, that can't&#xD;
do nothin' but shake hishead and'twist his eye..&#xD;

Peter, being baffed, drew on his thinking.&#xD;
cap determinedly; but speedily forgetting  he&#xD;
deafness and dumbness,' broke out with:&#xD;
" Look here, you gorilla ! Let' me out o'&#xD;
this, and I'll give ye a dozen dollars. A dozen?&#xD;
Two dozen-three, or even four, on a pinch."&#xD;

tilivious 'of" wood-choppers, still-hunters, or&#xD;
afy living creature.&#xD;

on well. Babel's vigilance, which had been&#xD;
maintained at the -expense of sluiber relaxed&#xD;
more and'more. 'he white rims grew less and&#xD;
less, till there were but two hair-line eirces,&#xD;
which finally vanished.&#xD;
Peter queried ,whetlier blacks saw from the&#xD;

and laid down the hammer whieh he had just&#xD;

'MILROSE; OR, THE COTT&#xD;
There was a slight, a very slight sound some-&#xD;
where ; it was the 'soft rustle of a garment, and&#xD;
the gentle slipping of a foot on the floor. Peter&#xD;
Rust felt, rather than saw, a presence, at first;&#xD;
but, looking over Batel's head, his eyes were&#xD;
greeted with an unexpected sight. It was some-&#xD;
thing altogether mortal, however. It was a&#xD;
young woman of sixteen or seventeen years,&#xD;
who stood gazing at him over the squat figure&#xD;
of the black, with a terrified and wondering ex-&#xD;
pression. Her face, neck, and hands were white&#xD;
as a lily. .&#xD;
Peter spoke not, nor wished to. Never had&#xD;
feminine shape so surprised him. He was real-&#xD;
ly very practical and unimaginative ; but odd&#xD;
fancies for a moment disturbed him. The clear,&#xD;
singularly earnest eyes, with the dark and beau-&#xD;
tifully-arched line of brows above them pen-&#xD;
ciled so exquisitely on the snowy skin, bewil-&#xD;
dered his simple nature, and confused his natu-&#xD;
rally calm mind. Had the souls of young girls&#xD;
lived in lilies, the pearly whiteness of her com-&#xD;
plexion would not have astonished him. He&#xD;
had always supported the common-place phi-&#xD;
losophy that flesh was flesh, and clay was clay.&#xD;
But here was a pretty piece of humanity that&#xD;
entirely upset his theory.&#xD;
The circumstances, the hour, the terror,&#xD;
timidity, and beauty of the white-robed visitor,&#xD;
all had their effect on Peter, who knew not&#xD;
whether to advance or retreat, speak or remain&#xD;
silent. Babel was the stumbling-block. Babel&#xD;
was between them. Babel banned his tongue.&#xD;
Babel was a black doubt ; a miserable uncer-&#xD;
tainty.                                '.&#xD;
Being an honest and well-meaning man, he&#xD;
put his hand on his heart, and stood respect-&#xD;
fully before the girl, who appeared as much at&#xD;
a loss as himself, besides beingtfrightened.- ' He&#xD;
knew that young women did not tremble with-&#xD;
out cause, and his good sense immediately sug-&#xD;
gested one.&#xD;
Was the negro asleep?  Was he really deaf,&#xD;
sleeping pr waking?&#xD;
The brain is inventive under difficulties.&#xD;
With chalk, he wrote, in large letters, on a&#xD;
piece of stuff :&#xD;
"Is this for you ?"&#xD;
He held the writing up in, the light of the&#xD;
lamp. ..&#xD;
She read the words and seemed distressed,&#xD;
but made no sign. He wrote again:'&#xD;
"It is a prison."&#xD;
She moved her head affirmatively.&#xD;
" Iam working against my will."&#xD;
She smiled faintly, and assented as before.&#xD;
Peter understood her as well as if she had&#xD;
said : " I know it ; I know it."&#xD;
" What have you done ?" he wrote. ,&#xD;
She clasped her hands and looked silently&#xD;
upward-.&#xD;
" I'll swear that you never harmed a human&#xD;
&#xD;
ON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
being I" he wrote. A grateful glow suffused&#xD;
her features.&#xD;
" For love!"&#xD;
Peter scratched this question on the rough&#xD;
beard with some hesitation, and was sorry when&#xD;
he held it up-that he had been so bold. He&#xD;
was treading delicate ground.&#xD;
The girl's incomparable whiteness did not&#xD;
change much. There was a slight smile, and&#xD;
a momentary drooping of the eyes, and no&#xD;
more.&#xD;
Peter did not feel answered. He stroked his.&#xD;
board, as if he had been guilty .of an offence,&#xD;
and wrote :&#xD;
"For money ?"&#xD;
He watched her eagerly.&#xD;
She stood unresponsive an instant, glanced&#xD;
apprehensively at Babel, sighed, and Peter be-&#xD;
lieved it was Yes.&#xD;
He was at a loss what to do next ; coaxing&#xD;
his invention a moment, his countenance be-,&#xD;
came animated. He wrote:&#xD;
" Can I help you ?"&#xD;
She shook her head doubtfully.&#xD;
"Is the black deaf ?" he added.&#xD;
.She nodded quickly.&#xD;
"Then why not-" began Peter, in a low&#xD;
voice. A warning gesture, and a terrified look&#xD;
stopped him of a sudden. Poor Peter was&#xD;
dreadfully perplexed.&#xD;
Her startled manner convinced him that he&#xD;
had been guilty of an indiscretion. Her small&#xD;
hands thrust toward him deprecatingly, made&#xD;
him feel like a criminal.&#xD;
'She now seemed in the attitude of listening,&#xD;
but to what, he could not tell, for he heard&#xD;
nothing. While standing expectant, wondering&#xD;
what next would happen she flitted from the&#xD;
door, and out of sight.&#xD;
Peter looked a moment at the spot where&#xD;
he had last seen her, then fell to work indus-&#xD;
triously, making a great clattering about the&#xD;
ears of Babel, who, as far as he could discover,&#xD;
was in no manner disturbed by the din. Rais-&#xD;
ing his eyes presently, he saw Lowenthal at&#xD;
the door, watching him.&#xD;
The flight of. his mysterious visitor had led&#xD;

steps lightly and makes no noise, and comes up,&#xD;
with the game afore it's aware-one as is not&#xD;
heard till he strikes, and never strikes till he&#xD;

Peter's voice, as he proceeded, took on , more&#xD;
and mor- an earnest and impressive tone. There&#xD;
was a kind of quiet solemnity in. his enuncia-&#xD;
tion. Lowentlial never felt so strangely in his&#xD;
life. le knew not what he had caged.&#xD;
"Perhaps you think.you've gQt a nigger here&#xD;

Because you command a hundred slaves, 'and&#xD;

you mean to rule without regard to the rights&#xD;
of others. While eallin' cotton king; you king&#xD;

Very well! I know it. What am I? A pris-&#xD;
oner. .I know that, too. But I've got wit-a&#xD;
free gift of Mother Natur'-and that's all I've&#xD;
got to stake agin your undisputed authority.&#xD;
There ! Now:I allow that you know some'at&#xD;
about Peter Rust."&#xD;
Peter ceased, and waited some time for am&#xD;
answer. When Lowenthal spoke,. his voice was&#xD;
steadier and calmer than before, but far more&#xD;
dangerous.&#xD;
"It does not become my rank and station,"&#xD;
he said, " to waste time and words on a low-born&#xD;
fellow.  Slow-i racker and still-hunter as you&#xD;
are, I don't think you'll be able to slow-track pr,&#xD;
still-hunt your way out of my dwelling back to&#xD;
your beggarly barrens!".&#xD;
Peter Rust looked through a' small hole in&#xD;
the door, that he had made for that purpose,&#xD;
and saw the planter cock a revolver and direct&#xD;
its muzzle to a panel, then waited, evidently,&#xD;
for him to speak.&#xD;
Peter didn't speak, but, stepping out of range,&#xD;
tapped on the panel with a stick.&#xD;
Thinking Peter's body was where the sound&#xD;
was, Lowenthal let fly, a ball, which, tearing'&#xD;
through the door, went out at the window, op-&#xD;
posite..&#xD;
Peter sprang upward as far as be could for,&#xD;
the ceiling, and came down, sprawling,.near the'&#xD;
door. Everything in the room rattled with the&#xD;
shock.   ~.&#xD;
Lowenthal put up his pistol and listened.. It&#xD;
seemed to him that he had done mischief;&#xD;
but that didn't disturb his equanimityat all.&#xD;
He was used to doing mischief. He had shot&#xD;
runaways often, and winged a few Union men of&#xD;
late.&#xD;
&#xD;
He beard no sound,; and concluding that Pe.&#xD;
ter was very dead or very deceitfull, he went&#xD;
slowly down-stairs to his breakfast.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
SWAMPSEY.&#xD;
Peter Rust, being neither hit n(r hurt.arose.&#xD;
It was- now 4 plain matter of deadly enmity be--&#xD;
tween 1.owenthal and, himself. The inteitions.&#xD;
of the planter, there was, no longer room to&#xD;
doubt. But;Peter did xnt regret ,speaking his&#xD;
mind. Ie; felt ,less' lie; a hypocrite, and more&#xD;
like a.-man); ages:safety, and more ,etermina-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
The, way the case ,tood, it was a question of&#xD;
egpapq, or something worse.. Exchange, places,&#xD;
in imagination,,w;ith Peter, and. the difficulties&#xD;
apd embarrassments will be, better apprehend-&#xD;
ed. The windows were a long way from the&#xD;
ground.  One could not drop from -them, like&#xD;
Biruin from a treenand run away unhurt. There&#xD;
was a poor chance of escaping in that direction&#xD;
without.an outside assistant. Ire looked down-&#xD;
ward wishfully, and that was all he could do.&#xD;
He raised the skylight, then drawimgg the&#xD;
chest along, and placing some lumber on it, he&#xD;
mounted high enoug    to examine the roof,&#xD;
which had a pitch so sharp as to render walking&#xD;
upon it unsafe.. There was a light iron paling&#xD;
just back of the gutters, but it looked as if a&#xD;
slide against it would eariy it away.&#xD;
Theview before Peter was not a cheerful one.&#xD;
There were the slippery tiles that no feet could&#xD;
standupon; tiere.was the oblique surface, with&#xD;
nothing for the hands to grasp ; there was the&#xD;
increasing velocity, when one got started ; and&#xD;
belowwas the fatal fall, with, seemingly, nothing&#xD;
but acobweb between.to prevent it.&#xD;
Peter Rust did. not wish to break his neck to,&#xD;
save his life ; but he i'esolved to trust himself&#xD;
on the roof :assoon.as it was dark, if no 'more&#xD;
feasible method presented. He would have&#xD;
made the trial then, had not, the whole, planta-&#xD;
tion peep astir. It was fortunate for him that&#xD;
he exposed so little of his person ; for just 'as&#xD;
he was witidraiving, he discovered Ben Dykes&#xD;
lurking suspiciously about the grounds.&#xD;
"The lazy ;villain !" muttered Peter. "He's&#xD;
got a hankerin' after my double-gun."'&#xD;
Peter dren .phis ,head, closed the skylight,&#xD;
and continued his observations from the win-.&#xD;
dows.with little or no satisfaction.&#xD;
, The 'day wore on veryslowly. ~ He called on&#xD;
his patience, and his, equanimity did not fail&#xD;
him. He.heard Babel walking to and fro .in.&#xD;
the passage, a d, save his, shuffling footsteps,&#xD;
no other sound in pthe bouse. Iuggry he was,&#xD;
and, thirsty; but hunger and thirst were o:"t&#xD;
companions whom he - had net on the plaint&#xD;
and in the forest. He could bear their ,omp&#xD;
ny very well for a day or two. He wast'notg -&#xD;

WANT HIM GOT OUT!&#xD;
With the night came clouds, and with the&#xD;
clouds, darkness. Both clouds and darkness&#xD;
seemed to favor the intentions of Milrose.. An-&#xD;
geline had been faithfully busy.- Such. parcels&#xD;
as she could comfortably carry had been made&#xD;
up, and been put out of sight, ih readiness for&#xD;
flight; and mistress and naid waited in much&#xD;
agitation for the hour of dejparture. The enter-&#xD;
prise was not without romantic coloring. .Robe&#xD;
had been wonderfully suggestive, and Angeline&#xD;
equally wonderful in execution.&#xD;
The latter had succeeded in obtaining, 'by&#xD;
much finesse, the uniform of a drummer-boy for&#xD;
the disguise of her mistress, and, by the same&#xD;
happy management, the second suit of a youth-&#xD;
ful trumpeter, who had been somewhat intoxi-&#xD;
cated, by her beauty and -two 'glasses of Bour-&#xD;

&#xD;
MILROSE; .OR, THE COTT&#xD;
&#xD;
two chairs, Milrose was looking at with very&#xD;
wide eyes.&#xD;
Laws, Miss Milly! They- won't hurt yet&#xD;
these things won't.. Needn't be queer 'bout'em.&#xD;
You'll look jest as .handsome as you, can live !&#xD;
Can't make ye look ugly, anyways."&#xD;
In spite of these friendly assurances, Milrose&#xD;
stared a greatdeal at the gray jackets and&#xD;
trowsers, and the jaunty fatigue-eaps. Could&#xD;
she ever get used to such comical things?&#xD;
"Love o' God !' exclaimed Angeline, putting&#xD;
her hand suddenly on Milrose's head. " What's&#xD;
to be done with this hair? I done forgot it."&#xD;
" Can't ,you arrange it somehow, Angeline ?"&#xD;
asked Milrose, with a startled look.&#xD;
"Bless ye, no, mistress ! There's more'n two&#xD;
eapfuls of it. And such hair ! It's finer'n silk,&#xD;
and blaeker'n Babel's wool. Can't fix it, no-&#xD;
ways -"&#xD;
"Cut it off," answered Milrose, with an ex&#xD;
eusable sigh ; for her hair was incomparably&#xD;
beautiful.&#xD;
"Can't do it, Miss Milly, anyways! IHaint&#xD;
got the heart to lay a scissors to them silky&#xD;
cerls. Tell 3 ou what, it's wicked. True's I&#xD;
live, 'twould be designationI"&#xD;
"Designation, or' desecration, I must submit&#xD;
Ito it. Get your scissors, and begin."&#xD;
Wouldn't tried to make ye a boy, if 'spected&#xD;
this !" muttered Angeline, most unwillingly be-&#xD;
gmning to clip the long and shining locks.&#xD;
.1 No boy ever had such hair. Coarse stuff,&#xD;
boy's hair is  Declar' I feel like a manefactor!&#xD;
To think how many would go crazyfor this hair!"&#xD;
The dark tresses fell one after another. An-&#xD;
geline fetched a great sigh at every stroke of her&#xD;
scissors. It appeared to her that their troubles&#xD;
had really begun.&#xD;
"I heard something," said Milrose.&#xD;
"So did I; I heard my heart thumping' with&#xD;
grief, and the clip, clip of these horrid scissors!"&#xD;
responded Angeline,.petulantly.&#xD;
It wanls at the window. I wish you'd open&#xD;
it," said Milrose, uneasily.&#xD;
." In half a minute, mistress. 'Most done,"&#xD;
replied the girl, lingering.to complete the sac-&#xD;
rifice. She had severed the last curl, and was&#xD;
in the act of obedience, when the window was&#xD;
softly pushed up from the outside, and a little&#xD;
blae boy, in a tow shirt, appeared, standing in&#xD;
the open space between the sash and the floor.&#xD;
This little black boy was Swampsey; and he&#xD;
had his hands behind him. But this little black&#xD;
boy, with his hands behind him, made as much&#xD;
sensation as if he had been as large as the giant&#xD;
of Gath. Two pairs of bright eyes turned their&#xD;
fires on Swampsey. Two pretty faces paled with+&#xD;
fear, and mistress and maid thought they were&#xD;
betrayed...&#xD;
" Want him got out!" said Swampsey., Not&#xD;
a muscle of his small body moved.&#xD;
Milrose and Angeline began to breathe, and&#xD;
look at each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
ON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
Swampsey waited a reasonable time.&#xD;
" Want him got out !"&#xD;
"Love o'-God!" cried Angeline.&#xD;
" Want -him got out !" repeated Swampsey.&#xD;
"He waits him got out !" echoed Angeline&#xD;
with the blankest of faces.&#xD;
"Wan't whom got out ?" asked Milrose.&#xD;
"' Mars'r Peter!"&#xD;
The voice seemed to come from an infant&#xD;
sepulchre.. It was low-pitched, and straight on&#xD;
It was a serious matter with Swampsey.&#xD;
" Mars'r Peter ?" queried Angeline, yet in th&#xD;
dark.&#xD;
" Up yon !" said Swampsey, jerking his he&#xD;
upward,.,,&#xD;
" Peter Rust !" exclaimed Milrose, rapid]&#xD;
connecting several fractional facts.&#xD;
Instantly Swampsey threw two forward sce&#xD;
ersets to the centre of the room, cut a caper o&#xD;
-hisown invention, and clapped his hands lhe&#xD;
him again-&#xD;
Milrose was amazed.' This was her first ac&#xD;
quaintanee with Swampsey.&#xD;
1' Gracious.! what a frog it is ! Didn't kno&#xD;
there was such a little straddle-bug on th&#xD;
plantation."&#xD;
Swampsey winked and blinked.&#xD;
"Tell you what, too," continued Angeline&#xD;
" Shouldn't wonder if this was the little blac&#xD;
midget that follows Peter of the Pines."&#xD;
Swampsey's grave head. bobbed up and&#xD;
down.&#xD;
" Want him got out," he said, with an eye to&#xD;
business.&#xD;
" He's your master ?" asked Milrose.&#xD;
"Mars'r Peter!" answered Swampsey.&#xD;
" I, can't help your master, little fellow,"&#xD;
said:Rose. "I wish I could, but I can't."&#xD;
Swampseywinked vacantly. He could rde&#xD;
understand her inability. He studied her face&#xD;
most wishfully, as dogs look at their masters t&#xD;
know their minds.&#xD;
"What's your name, you curious chicken ?'&#xD;
demanded Angeline.&#xD;
" Swampsey," replied the boy, with a double&#xD;
wink.&#xD;
" Laws ! Swampsey !" said Angeline.  " Sh&#xD;
can't git him out, anyways."&#xD;
The features of Swampsey remained hope&#xD;
lessly vague ana unsatisfied.&#xD;
" Can't git herself out, you little stupid nig&#xD;
ger ! Shut up here, we be, as if we's fightin&#xD;
Fed'ralists. Go 'way !"&#xD;
Swampsey somersaulted back to the window-&#xD;
sill. It was a sign that he had an idea.&#xD;
"Want a rope !" he. said, when he ha&#xD;
crossed his hands behind him again.&#xD;
"Go 'long, with your-tow shirt!"&#xD;
Angeline didn't mean to be cross, but he&#xD;
mistress' business was of more importance than&#xD;
Peter Rust's.&#xD;
"Waint a rope!I" persisted  wanpe.      '&#xD;

Rose hear the girl trying to open it, and be-&#xD;
lieved they should be obliged to. seek some&#xD;
other avenue of escape. They stood in total&#xD;
darkness. While Angeline fumbled at the lock,&#xD;
heavy footsteps crossed the garden, and came&#xD;
deliberately to the door.&#xD;
Milrose caught Angeline by the shoulders&#xD;
and drew her closely to the wall. Her mind, in&#xD;
an emergency of this kind, acted quicker than&#xD;
that of her maid.&#xD;

came in, closed and relocked the door, and went&#xD;
creaking gp-stairs, leaving the two runaways in&#xD;
a painful suspense.&#xD;
Milrose's tact alone had prevented discovery ;'&#xD;
for when the door swung open, they were nes-&#xD;

The lumbering steps were now in the hail&#xD;
above ; and the girl, while she was speaking,&#xD;
turned the key and opened the door. They&#xD;
quickly passed out, and, with little chills of&#xD;
fear, found themselves in the dreary darkness.&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
MARS R     PETER.&#xD;
When Peter Rust could no longer see Swamp-&#xD;
sey, he felt more lonely than ever. It was some&#xD;
comfort to look at the little black fite that&#xD;
had followed him so long and so faithfully tum-&#xD;
bling about on the grass.&#xD;
Feeling about in the tool-chest, he found a&#xD;
chalk-line. Slipping the looped end over his&#xD;
finger, he dropped the reel from the window,&#xD;
ii         which went whirling and unwinding to the&#xD;
ground. He feared, as it swirled downward,&#xD;
that it was not long enough ; but when it was&#xD;
all run out, he was pleased to discover that he&#xD;
could fathom  the distance.  Taking a turn&#xD;
:around a nail, he let it hang there-p1iling at&#xD;
it occasionally, as if he were fishing for foun-&#xD;
ders.  It was his magnetic connection - his&#xD;
Swampsey telegraph.&#xD;
Peter Rust sat there, musing, hour after hour.&#xD;
The absence of Lowenthal still perplexed him;&#xD;
but Babel he could hear, at intervals, shuffling&#xD;
to and fro in the passage.&#xD;
The large lamp hung unlighted and dark in&#xD;
the bracket. He had the means of lighting it ;&#xD;
but he preferred the unlighted prison, nor cared&#xD;
to make himself' a better target. He had re-&#xD;
solved to defer his attempt to escape till a late&#xD;
hour ; and it required the exercise of no little&#xD;
self-control to remain passive till then.&#xD;
Bobbing at the line, by-and-by lie thought lie&#xD;
had coaxed a bite ; for it had grown heavier.&#xD;
He began. to pull in, and the resistance grew&#xD;
&#xD;
more palpable. Up and up came the line, a: d&#xD;
up and up went Peter's curiosity. When, hand&#xD;
over hand, Peter had drawn in all -the line, the&#xD;
cause of the extra weight appeared in the form&#xD;
of a rope knotted to the reel. Seizing the end&#xD;
of the rope, Peter tied it to a stout joist, which&#xD;
he placed across the window in a trice--then&#xD;
paused to think.&#xD;
"It can't be the little chattel," he muttered.&#xD;
" Swampsey wouldn't never think of a rope.&#xD;
He's chock full o' somerset ; but there isn't no&#xD;
contrivance in him. - If he could git me out by&#xD;
stannin' on his head, or unj'intin' his legs, or&#xD;
by any kind of a; trick that has a good 'eal o'&#xD;
squirm in it, he'd do it. But a rope ! Oh no !&#xD;
Couldn't git a rope out of him. I've got a&#xD;
friend somewhere 'round, and the bein's above&#xD;
only know who 'tis; for I don't. Can't think&#xD;
of nobody in this mis'rable, rebellious, king-&#xD;
eotton country that'd go a step out of his way to&#xD;
do me a good turn."&#xD;
Peter reflected; but memory refused to quick-&#xD;
en him. He examined the rope. It was rather&#xD;
small, -but .new and strong. He believed he&#xD;
might'safely trust his weight upon it. It would&#xD;
be hard clinging to it; but Peter had seasoned&#xD;
palms and tough fingers.&#xD;
He glanced out to see how far he could fol-&#xD;
low the white track of the cord. His eyes'&#xD;
traveled about fifteen feet, andwere thrown off&#xD;
the track by a black object that looked like a&#xD;
football.  Over this football Peter puzzled a&#xD;
moment ; but when he saw it moving upward,&#xD;
he understood. It was Swampsey, climbing the&#xD;
rope ! Swampsey, pushing up through the dark-&#xD;
ness ! Swampsey, dancing in the air, like a cork-&#xD;
on a trout-line!, Swampsey, swimming like a&#xD;
frog and'mounting like a monkey ! Swampsey,&#xD;
not i the least disturbed, pausing now and then&#xD;
to, swing by one hand, or hang by his flexed&#xD;
legs, head downward.&#xD;
Peter was mute with wonder. He shivered&#xD;
somewhat, too, at the wild antics of the boy.&#xD;
He drew back, expecting to hear him drop up-&#xD;
on the ground, and was going to speak to him&#xD;
sharply to make him cautious, when the black&#xD;
head shot up above the window-sill. For an&#xD;
instant the pigmy elbows rested on the sill, and&#xD;
the serious little face was turned upon Peter.&#xD;
The attitude and the expression touched Peter.&#xD;
He stared at Swampsey.&#xD;
" Mars'r Peter !"&#xD;
There was infinite content on his still fea-&#xD;
tures.&#xD;
Peter caught him by the arms and drew him&#xD;
in, and set him on his feet with surprising.&#xD;
quickness.&#xD;
Swampsey straightened up his yard of length,&#xD;
clapped his hands behind him, and said:&#xD;
"Mars'r Peter !"&#xD;
The two words were very simple, but they&#xD;
spoke the one sentiment of the boy's life-love&#xD;
for Peter.&#xD;
&#xD;
The white six feet two, looked down benignly&#xD;
at the three feet nothing in.the tow shirt.&#xD;
"Poor-Swampsey ! queer little nigger !"&#xD;
Peter's voice was kind, and there was a note&#xD;
of pity in it.&#xD;
"I was afeard you'd break your neck."&#xD;
Swampsey joggled his head, to see if his neck&#xD;
was right. t-.                        ,&#xD;
"'Taii't broke, I guess; but you might broke&#xD;
it," continued Peter. " But who put ye to&#xD;
coming' up? Who got the rope and tied it on ?"&#xD;
" Tole lies. Stole rope. Help Mars-r Peter,"&#xD;
answered Swampsey, in his straight-on style.&#xD;
" What, alone ? Well, leavin' out the lyin'&#xD;
and stealin', which comes nat'ral to niggers,&#xD;
that's extr'ordiner ! There's more in that tow-&#xD;
shirt than-there looks to be. It'll hold, Is'pose&#xD;
--won't it ?"&#xD;
Peter took hold of the rope, and Swampsey&#xD;
nodded violently.&#xD;
" Then slide down,,little nig, and I'll be after&#xD;
ye in no time.. Go keerful, and don't stop to&#xD;
Cut shines."&#xD;
Swam psey sprang to the window-sill, and was&#xD;
out of sight in a moment.&#xD;
Peter followed him more leisurely, and, after&#xD;
some dangerous swinging, reached the ground&#xD;
safely, but with wounded and smarting fingers.&#xD;
He paused an instant to breathe, glanced at the&#xD;
house with a quiet smile, and stalked silently&#xD;
away, with Swampsey running at his heels.&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
FLIGHT.&#xD;
Hurrying across the cultivated ground, shun-&#xD;
ning the negro quarters, choosing thb shaded&#xD;
walks, and stepping softly, mistress and maid&#xD;
left Lowenthal behind. The plans of the fugi-&#xD;
tives were not very definite. They hoped to&#xD;
find temporary shelter in the lut of a poor'&#xD;
white, and on the following day put' in practice&#xD;
those somewhat crude schemes which they had&#xD;
talked over.&#xD;
Angeline resorted to a singular expedient to&#xD;
entertain Milrose on the way ; she related vari-&#xD;
ous startling things that had happenedin the&#xD;
ine woods, and on the borders of the planta-&#xD;
tions. These tales did not increase the young&#xD;
lady's courage. Her imagination became so&#xD;
excited that she momentarily expected to have&#xD;
a frightful adventure. She often detected her-&#xD;
self looking to the right and left-for some un-&#xD;
welcome object, and involuntarily holding her&#xD;
breath to listen for footsteps. She was finally&#xD;
obliged to rebuke the untimely volubility of&#xD;
Angeline.           a&#xD;
Although the darkness covered her flight,&#xD;
Milrose's situation was so new that its gloom&#xD;
constantly made her shiver. She had trodden&#xD;
those winding paths in sunshine only, whd'n&#xD;
there was no occasion for fear,; but that night&#xD;
reversed everything, and turned another leaf in&#xD;
her life.&#xD;
&#xD;
They reached a cabin standing among some&#xD;
trees. -They might easily have passed without&#xD;
seeing it, had not the- footpath led directly to&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
" What is this ?" asked Milrose.&#xD;
" Peter Rust lives here, Miss Milly. We can&#xD;
go in and rest a minute or two, if you like.&#xD;
You breathe kinder hard, that's cl'ar."&#xD;
" Poor Peter !" saiI Rose.&#xD;
" Laws, Mistress, lie's a Yankee I Ain't no&#xD;
'count, nohow l" answered Angeline, slighting-&#xD;
ly. "Got no plantation. Own's no niggers, he&#xD;
don't. Isn't much s'perior to Ben Dykes, and&#xD;
them."&#xD;
Angeline resolutely pushed open the door,&#xD;
and Milrose reluctantly followed her in. With-&#xD;
in, nothing was appreciable but darkness. Rose&#xD;
paused, afraid to step. Angeline, less timid,&#xD;
went feeling and stumbling about.&#xD;
" Here's a stool, honey ; sit down, and don't&#xD;
be flurried. Won't nothin' hurt ye. Jest- as&#xD;
safe as Mars'r Dan'l was amongg the lions."&#xD;
"I cannot think ~ of stopping in this dark&#xD;
place. We may not be alone," answered Milrose.&#xD;
"hLaws! nobody here.. Nobody'd be likely to&#xD;
be here. 'cept that little toddlepole. Could&#xD;
wring his neck quieker'n you could 'blow-out a&#xD;
candles'"&#xD;
" I was told that I could trust this Peter Rust,"&#xD;
said Milrose, reflectively.&#xD;
"You can't trust a man that's shut up in a&#xD;
construction. Stands to reason ! 'Nother-thing,&#xD;
he ain't no company-for a forn lady that owns,&#xD;
a heap o''niggers. Ought to practice a deal o'&#xD;
circumflection 'bout your s'eiety,' said the girl,&#xD;
oracularly.&#xD;
My position is certainly enviable !" laughed&#xD;
Milrose. " What do yon suppose I am worth,&#xD;
girl ?"&#xD;
" Eight or ten million, I'spect. Laws I I&#xD;
don' know. May be more'n that," replied An-&#xD;
geline, promptly.&#xD;
"You have strange notions of figures," said&#xD;
Milrose, amused in-spite of herself. I am, real-&#xD;
ly, but a poor runaway. I have so little money&#xD;
in my purse, tha' I shall be obliged to pawn my&#xD;
jewelry ; a necessity that I shall yield to as soon&#xD;
as I can find a money-changer."&#xD;
"Bless ye ! 'spect I knows one that ar' kind&#xD;
o' folks. Mars'r goes to him to get money. I&#xD;
done found that out myself. Sells money.&#xD;
Queer !"&#xD;
Angeline stopped to think about selling mo-&#xD;
ney.&#xD;
" He lives.a long  tretch from the plantation,&#xD;
though," she added. " Curis name, too. Mark-&#xD;
thaler, 'tis. Mars'r Lowenthal's been to him&#xD;
more'n once. Mighty cross when he- goes to&#xD;
Markthaler's, and mighty set up when he comes&#xD;
home."&#xD;

26             MILROSE; OR, THE COTT(&#xD;
husband. You, must have been very observing{&#xD;
or very meddlesome. If all waiting-maids were&#xD;
like you, masters and mistresses would have few&#xD;
secrets."&#xD;
" Can't help it ! Eyes and ears wasn't made&#xD;
for nothin'.. Mine wasn't, leastways."&#xD;
" Come, Angeline !  I don't like this dark.&#xD;
p lace. Lead me, if you can, to the poor white&#xD;
family you spoke of."&#xD;
Milrose groped her way out. Then the fugi-&#xD;
tive pair joined hands and walked on.&#xD;
Fairly in the forest, new fears assailed them.&#xD;
The barrens abounded with wild animals, which&#xD;
might lurk in their path. Then there were oth-&#xD;
er creatures, of the Ben Dvkes order, to be no&#xD;
less dreaded. As they passed under the lofty&#xD;
arches of the pines, these dangers, to their dis-&#xD;
turbed minds, drew nearer. Keeping closely&#xD;
together, they hastened forward in silence. An-&#xD;
geline's garrulity was tamed ; and Milrose half&#xD;
regretted that she had not remained at Peter's&#xD;
cabintill the day began to dawn. But that was&#xD;
too near the prison she was flying from,.and&#xD;
that truth gave strength to her feet and. firmness&#xD;
to her will. Lowenthal was a greater terror&#xD;
than beasts of prey or, the starless gloom of&#xD;
night. She urged on her companion, whose&#xD;
fears equaled her own, but whose mind had less&#xD;
force, and whose actions had a feebler impelling&#xD;
motive.&#xD;
They heard dull and distant sounds in the&#xD;
forest. Angeline wished to turn back ; Rose,&#xD;
more practical, stopped to listen.&#xD;
" I declar' for't, Miss Milly, my courage is&#xD;
done gone ! If them ain't catamounts a comm',&#xD;
it'll be the mercy o' God !" said Angeline.&#xD;
" You've not a particle of reason," answered&#xD;
Milrose. " A wild beast wouldn't come upon&#xD;
us with such a clatter as that. It would creep&#xD;
without noise, or lie in wait and spring on us&#xD;
before we had warning of danger."&#xD;
" Tell you what ! that's worse than 'tother&#xD;
way.   Creep, creep, ereep !  Crawl, crawl,&#xD;
crawl! Seems as if I could hear one this min-&#xD;
ute, coming' without a bit o' noise."&#xD;
" Your sense and courage have gone togeth-&#xD;
er, Angeline," Rose replied. "Do be quiet.&#xD;
That which makes no noi-i cannot be heard.&#xD;
The sounds that you can really hear are made&#xD;
by horses, and not by dangerous beasts. Do&#xD;
you not hear the iron thud ;.I their feet?"&#xD;
"I do b'lieve 'tis. Laws, yes! And there's&#xD;
folks ridin' 'em. Knew 'tw!" i't nothin'.. You&#xD;
git seared dreadful easy, Mis-. Milly."&#xD;
Angeline was now very bra+'s.&#xD;
" Tole ye there's folks on Wu," she went on.&#xD;
" Can ;hear 'em talk. Been  ire in the day-&#xD;
time, time and time ag'in, and never was the&#xD;
leastest natom seared. Don't br'ue ye for be-&#xD;
in' flustered, though. It looked eone pokerish&#xD;
for a spell."       ,&#xD;
The voices of persons could now be plainly&#xD;
heard, and Lo4enthal's among them.&#xD;
&#xD;
MILROSE ; OR' THE' COTTON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
ON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
"Tell you what ! there's marer's voice," add-&#xD;
ed the voluble maid. "Shouldn't wonder if&#xD;
he's pursuitin' of us."&#xD;
" if he was pursuing us, he would be quite&#xD;
likely to come. from' the opposite direction,"&#xD;
Milrose sharply replied.,&#xD;
" So he would, come to think!d Shouldn't,&#xD;
meet him if he's follerin' after us. You've got,&#xD;
a head-piece, anyways."&#xD;
" Let's get out of the path," said Rose. " He&#xD;
is near, and my heart beat's fast, in spite of&#xD;
me."&#xD;
Milrose and the girl glided from the path and&#xD;
sat down among the pines. The former, al-&#xD;
though there was not much danger of discovery,&#xD;
exaggerated what there was, and awaited the&#xD;
passing of Lowenthal with anxiety. le ap-&#xD;
proached, talking fiercely of the war. He, and&#xD;
those with him, were excited with liquor. Like&#xD;
all persons more or less intoxicated, they were&#xD;
pot-valiant. They defied their Northern foes ;&#xD;
and said they would make every battle-field a&#xD;
Bull Run. There would be a large -crop of&#xD;
Bull Runners. The new army on the Potomac&#xD;
was but a Manassas egg, that would soon yield&#xD;
a nestful of Bull Run chickens. Thus they&#xD;
made merry.&#xD;
Then they spoke, of a rumored invasion of&#xD;
Port Royal, and hoped the Yankees would soon&#xD;
appear, so that they might give them a taste of&#xD;
Southern steel. The would make the invaders&#xD;
bow to King Cotton  eore they were half ,done&#xD;
with them.&#xD;
Had they not traveled slowly and'talked loud'&#xD;
ly, as vaunters are wont, Milrose could not hairO&#xD;
heard so much. Their words were audible both&#xD;
before and after they had passed, and the last-&#xD;
distinct sentences she heard were bitter fulmina-&#xD;
tions against spies and informers, whom they&#xD;
intended to deal with most summarily.&#xD;
Milrose made no effort to see Lowenthal ani&#xD;
his companions. Sitting silently under the&#xD;
branches, shrinking and fearful, she was content&#xD;
to be passed unnoted. But Angeline, having&#xD;
more curiosity, stretched up her neck, and&#xD;
availed herself of every opening in the foliage'&#xD;
to look after them. Had not the clouds lifted&#xD;
a little, she would have seen absolutely nothing.&#xD;
But a. spectral spray of light, falling through&#xD;
an embrasure above, came opportunely to-her&#xD;
aid. She protested, after hoofs and voices went&#xD;
out'of hearing, that she had seen the parties go&#xD;
by, and that on\ one of the horses sat a young&#xD;
man with his hands tied behind him.'- This per-&#xD;
son, she declared, rode with his head down, and&#xD;
had a dispirited look generally.&#xD;
"Your eyes," said lIilrose, "must have bees&#xD;
sharper than they, were a while since."&#xD;
"Laws, Miss Mill ! Don't s'pose I'd pere.&#xD;
ventricate, do ye ? Got one good look at 'em,&#xD;
and that's the truth. A little ribbon o' light&#xD;
come down through a hole in the clouds, and&#xD;
that's the way I got a peep at 'em. Tell yot&#xD;
&#xD;
27&#xD;
&#xD;
'what.! They hada prisoner, and:his arms was&#xD;
opinionated ahind him.''}&#xD;
"Describe him,"-said Milrose,.cincredulously.&#xD;
"And, to save timed 'let' us walk on."&#xD;
" Can't 'scribe him much.' Only got a glim-&#xD;
mer Hof him, you know. Couldn't see his physi-&#xD;
ology very well. Was, dressed- in blacks citi-&#xD;
zen's clothes, he was. H'e had black hair and a&#xD;
black cap, and I shouldn't wonder .but he was&#xD;
handsome. He wasa, pavilion, anyways."&#xD;
" Goodness ! E civilian, Angeline."&#xD;
"Laws! -means the same: thing. He wa in&#xD;
trouble, leastways. He 'got daohis horse like an&#xD;
anthomaston, and a more injected repression I&#xD;
never see. Tell ybu what, 'twas some Union,&#xD;
ambolition traitor that they've got hold of!"-&#xD;
Although Milrose. was not',inclined.-to 'give&#xD;
full credit to the girl's eyesight,-she was much&#xD;
troubled by her description of ' the 'prisoner,&#xD;
whom she could not help connecting, in some&#xD;
unaccountable manner,:with Frederick North.&#xD;
If that young man had fallen 'into -such bad&#xD;
hands, the worst might be -anticipated. - She&#xD;
tied to believe that 'he had  not only' es-&#xD;
caped the pistol of 'Lawenthal, but, all subse-&#xD;
quent perils. Thinking these thoughts,.turning&#xD;
over a hundred' things in her mind, making and&#xD;
unmaking predicaments, starting at , every&#xD;
sound, walking, now hurriedly,- now slowly&#xD;
looking not backward, with her eyes fixed -64&#xD;
the black and thread-like vista through which.&#xD;
the pathway ran, she did het.best for escape&#xD;
and liberty..&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
IN THE FOREST.&#xD;
For some time they.could feel the path with&#xD;
their feet. A hard indentation, distinctly ap-&#xD;
preciable, assured them that they were follow-&#xD;
ing. a beaten track.' Imperceptibly' this little&#xD;
foot-groove grew shallower and less apparent,&#xD;
.and by-and-by it was lost ; but the trees stood&#xD;
so far apart, and the, way was so unobstructed,&#xD;
that the fugitives did not immediately perceive&#xD;
.that they were walking where there was no&#xD;
path. The pine patriarchs loomed up grandly&#xD;
around them. .Soft, balsamic odors impregna-&#xD;
ted the quiet air.&#xD;
Milrose paused. The forest was a cathedral.&#xD;
The pine odor was the incense, swung silently'&#xD;
to and fro before the altar, by the hand of Na-&#xD;
ture. Milrose was awed, yet tranquilized. The&#xD;
vail of darkness drawn 'over the woods had&#xD;
,moresignificance and 'less terror. This tem-&#xD;
porary calmness.made her bear with more for-&#xD;
titude the discovery which she now- made that&#xD;
they had lost the friendly guide: that, had led&#xD;
,hem on with bopefuhless and tolerable courage.&#xD;
11Where is the path ?" Milrose asked.&#xD;
"'The Lord, he only knows, mistress! It's&#xD;
done gone. Never was so turned round."  An.'&#xD;
geline felt and looked vainly for the path.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Think you can find the hut yod spoke oxd$"&#xD;
asked Rose, nervously.&#xD;
' "Might-as well hunt fdr a pigeon's egg !" an-&#xD;
swered the:girl. ",Fact is, I'm el'ar run. out.&#xD;
Don' know which way to go. S'pect we're lost,&#xD;
and shall have to stay in, the woods all night,&#xD;
anyways. Thought l'se derd sure of the way.&#xD;
If the wild critters don't eat us, and we don't&#xD;
starve to death, and notlyin' happens to us, we&#xD;
ahall-do well 'nough."&#xD;
Angeline tried to speak with all the courage&#xD;
the situation required, and as it appeared, with&#xD;
far more than she possessed ;' for Milrose could&#xD;
hear her teeth chattering.,&#xD;
"So.you advise us to give up ?";said Milrose,&#xD;
who had long since arrived at 'the conclusion&#xD;
that she must trustingn herself and not in..Ange-&#xD;
line.&#xD;
"Don' know what's.the good tryin'. Better&#xD;
set down and save ours strength, than to :he&#xD;
walkin' 'bout. ''Sides, Miss hilly, my courage&#xD;
is, jest snoozin' out, o' my fingers-ends. But&#xD;
don't. be in a state o' perpetration, my dour&#xD;
mistress.. We can't be more'n killed, anywai;s.&#xD;
All gotito bekilled; sometime. Fed'rals '11 ill&#xD;
us, 'if- mars'r; don't.  Won't be nothin' liut&#xD;
killin' and ravagin' for the next few months."&#xD;
With this cheerful view of .things, Angelipe&#xD;
dropped upon the ground in Utter .desolation.&#xD;
Perplexed assshe was, Milrose could not lint&#xD;
smile at the ludicrous hopelessness of her at.&#xD;
tendant.&#xD;
"'Peers like I canhear 'em ereepin' 1" she et n-.&#xD;
tinued, her mind running on every species of&#xD;
dangers.&#xD;
" Get up, and come along I" said Milrose,&#xD;
sharply.&#xD;
" Can't, Miss Milly !.My limbs are jest 'tcn-&#xD;
alyzed with fright; and that's thu truth."&#xD;
Milrose was now obliged to exert her author.&#xD;
ity.&#xD;
Perceiving :that, her mistress was in: earnest,&#xD;
Angeline arose and followed her,, wondering&#xD;
that she' should be so brave.&#xD;
Trusting to her judgment, Mdose struck off&#xD;
through the more open partof the forest.with a&#xD;
strong resolution not to give up: She had ob-&#xD;
served that the ground gradually ascended as&#xD;
they receded from the plantation, and fell off&#xD;
whenever they' approached it, and this peculi-&#xD;
arity of 'the land:guided her. -er reason and&#xD;
,sagacity proved more reliable than her maid ;&#xD;
for after-walking about half an hour, they-were&#xD;
cheered by-the- discovery of a hut.: Cheered?&#xD;
Under. better circumstances, the word could&#xD;
not have beenused. It was, in fact, a- most&#xD;
miserable hut; a smoke-blackened, forlorn, and&#xD;
thriftless hut, with all the mute yet eloquent&#xD;
witnesses of sloth around it.&#xD;
Milrcse's first emotions of joy subsided as she&#xD;
silently stood and contemplated this wretched&#xD;
abode. The clouds had drifted    away from&#xD;
overhead, and the blurred light thrown on the&#xD;

wind and weather, and a tottering stick chim-&#xD;
ney at one end, Puffs of pitchpine smoke' re-&#xD;
volved .lazily froir the top of this chimney.&#xD;
The attention of', Milrose was - unpleasantly&#xD;
drawn from these 'matters by a great outcry of&#xD;
dogs. There was- a dire uproar inside ; - a&#xD;
scratching, whining, barking, howling, and yelp-&#xD;
ing. Little dogs, and large dogs, hounds, curs,-&#xD;
and terriers, small voices and big: voices,- and&#xD;
anon a human voice, united in one grand-over-&#xD;
ture.'&#xD;
"uLove o' God " cried Angeline. '4,You've&#xD;
taken me to Ben Dykes't1"&#xD;
" Ben Dykes I" repeated Milrose, in conster-&#xD;
nation.&#xD;
" Ben Dykes, the dog-trainer; Ben Dykes,&#xD;
the nigger-hunter ; Ben Dykes, the poor, good-&#xD;
for-nothin' white ;trash !" muttered Angeline,&#xD;
completely at fault.&#xD;
"Hush)" whispered Milrose, he is opening&#xD;
the door. I am afraid of those clamorous dogs.&#xD;
It is too late to retreat. If we run, those sav-&#xD;
age brutes will be after us.Now,e Angeline,&#xD;
do try and be prudent. Remember that you&#xD;
are a young man and belong to the army."&#xD;
" Laws !" I cl'ar forgot I's a young man,"&#xD;
said Angie. "And by the same ,token, you're&#xD;
a boy, Miss Milly. I. s'pect the whole thing'll&#xD;
leak out."       '&#xD;
"Be silent! - Do not speak except when&#xD;
spoken to, and then in the briefest, manner.&#xD;
Watch and imitate me;" answered Milrose, hur-&#xD;
riedy.&#xD;
" What's the matter out yer !" cried D kes.&#xD;
Down, pups, down ! Stop your bother. an't&#xD;
hear my own talk. What's up, I say ?"&#xD;
Ben Dykes seized 'two of the stoutest dogs by&#xD;
the napes of theit necks, and held them, at the&#xD;
same time kicking over a brace of cowardly,&#xD;
yet noisy young bulls.&#xD;
Milrose was going to reply ; but at the first&#xD;
trial her voicefailed her.&#xD;
" Who's thar ? Who's out yon?  I see ye,&#xD;
hidin' in the dark !" shouted Ben. " Come out&#xD;
o' that yer, or I'll let the dogs loose. Shouldn't&#xD;
wonder if you's runaway niggers."&#xD;
"You're mistaken, friend," said Milrose, ad-&#xD;
vancing, and using the most masculine voice&#xD;
she could make. It was not, the best article&#xD;
in the market; it was inferior in quantity, if not&#xD;
in quality. There should have been more of it.&#xD;
" What you squeakin' about?   Toddle up&#xD;
here, where I can see ye. Have ye got pistils'&#xD;
and sieh ? Don't, try no shootin' game on 'me.&#xD;
Jeff and Beau'! 1be onto ye, fast thing you dun-&#xD;
no !" vociferated Ben, warningly, pinching the&#xD;
dogs' necks to make them growl.&#xD;
" Don't be afraid, sir !" added Milrose, walk-&#xD;
ing cautiously among the canines." "It's our&#xD;
business to protect, not to hurt people." She&#xD;
said this with a condescension that quite sur-&#xD;
Vrised herself.&#xD;
&#xD;
ON-PLANTER'S 'DAUGHTER.&#xD;
"Sager' fellerss 1: soger i1fellers !" muttered&#xD;
Ben, as the two fictitious young fellows drew&#xD;
near:. -".They must'bekdratted hard up for so-&#xD;
gers, down yon.' -All I Cansay 'bout it is, that&#xD;
they might made ye bigger. -Reckon you crawl&#xD;
into the cannon to clean 'ern, and creep out&#xD;
through the:vent-hole to save turning' round."&#xD;
"Fine dogs, stitanger; fine dogs I" said Mil-&#xD;
rose, with a careless sweep of the hand.&#xD;
"They're sweet !dogs, anyways," interposed&#xD;
Angelinein beautiful masculine.&#xD;
"Wal, they be some, persimmons," them pups&#xD;
be. Some on 'em has been broke in. These two&#xD;
I've sot hold on'll take arter niggers beautiful !&#xD;

runaways don't see it. One of the black vil-&#xD;
'lains, tried to kill, this yer very pup. no longer&#xD;
ago than last week, jest 'cause he ketched him&#xD;
by the throat."     -.&#xD;
Ben Dykes fetched a sigh from the bottom&#xD;
of his thorax, in view of the awful depravit&#xD;
of niggers. But his attention was now much&#xD;
occu ped with his unexpeeted visitors.&#xD;
"What kind o' killing' do you do, mostly,&#xD;
,youngsters ?" he rather, sarcastically asked.&#xD;
"Should think you might make the worst kind&#xD;
of a panic in a poultry-yard. Got little straps&#xD;
on your jacket, hadn't ye, bubby ! This other&#xD;
cha 's got some on his'n, too. There ain't no&#xD;
higer officers than you be-be there? As I&#xD;
said afore,' all I've got to say is, they might&#xD;
made ye bigger:"&#xD;
Mr. Dykes opened his mouth and laughed&#xD;
a fearfully wide laugh.&#xD;
"Tell ye what I'- there's something they&#xD;
couldn't made bigger," .put in Angehine, in her&#xD;
very successful masculine.&#xD;
"Oh, you've pitched into iy Mouth, too!&#xD;
Everybody pitches into my mouth !" snarled&#xD;
Ben. "Darned if I can have my joke 'thout&#xD;
gettin' a fling in the mouth. Keep out, young-&#xD;
ster ! Tell ye to keep out !.&#xD;
Milrose apologized for Angeline's personali-&#xD;
ties, and' regretted that she had accidentally&#xD;
disturbed.his repose.       ,l&#xD;
" What weapons do ye carry ?"he asked, eye-&#xD;
ing them curiously.&#xD;
"Nothingrbut pistols, at present," Rose an-&#xD;
swered, with well-acted ind ifference. " I. be-&#xD;
lieve I have seen you at Lowenthal's," she&#xD;
added.&#xD;
" Be shot if ever I see you down yer. Can't&#xD;
git the hang:of ye, nohow. Look here I Ain't&#xD;

"You've just hit it," replied Milrose, with&#xD;
misgiving. " My friend is a trumpeter ; I beat&#xD;
the drum."&#xD;
"You beat me, too. Hanged if you don't.&#xD;
Drummer and trumpeter," mused Ben. " I've&#xD;
got a drum and a trumpet. Git ye to play&#xD;
'some tunes on 'em -,the fust thing you dunno.&#xD;
Come, tumble inside. My shanty's plenty big&#xD;
enough for a brace o' musieioners."&#xD;

MILROSE ; OR, THE COTTON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
she perceived that it-should have been no. nBut&#xD;
it was too late to mend it ; and She let it alone.&#xD;
" Yer folks was very ekernomieal," continued&#xD;
Ben. "Saves time, Tom does. Tom's a long&#xD;
handle .'nough for a short boy." !&#xD;
There never was such a thrilling in'her 'blood&#xD;
before. Had this white Savage of the-pine' bar-&#xD;
rens already penetrated her secret ?  If so, was&#xD;
not her position perilous ? It was, unquestion-&#xD;
ably. From hiscivilizationshe could-hope noth-&#xD;
ing, because he was not civilized ;fromhis hon-&#xD;
or nothing, for he had none ; from' his -honesty-&#xD;
nothing, for he' had none' of that.   She longed&#xD;
for the morning, Then she -thought that even&#xD;
the light might be dangerous. -'So there wasono&#xD;
end to her embarrassments; if there were, she,&#xD;
knew not where to find it.&#xD;
She 'looked to Angeline for strength; and was&#xD;
cheered to see that she was behaving very well,&#xD;
having, from habit, fewer scruples to: Contend&#xD;
with than herself. ' Besides, she 'was the hardi-&#xD;
est and best-skinned boy, and though she had&#xD;
proved faint-hearted in the woods, was now more&#xD;
at ease than her mistress. Perhaps the girl did&#xD;
not see the danger, or, seeing it, put 'at wrong&#xD;
estimate upon it.&#xD;
The teething baby moaned, and flung its thin&#xD;
arms restlessly about. Milrose, glancing pity-i&#xD;
ingly at the woman, met her 'mournful gaze,&#xD;
which, to her quick apprehension, grew to won-&#xD;
der while she looked.&#xD;
Some people's eyes seem stolen from the&#xD;
brute-races, and express only the craft necessa-&#xD;
ry to seize their piey, and provide for their dai-&#xD;
ly--recurring 'appetites. "Sueh eyes had Ben'&#xD;
Dykes;. 'Both eyes and instincts were for prey.,&#xD;
And thus Rose interpreted them.&#xD;
" Does Peter Rust live farfrom here'?" she in.,&#xD;
quired.&#xD;
"Peter ,of the pines V" said Ben,-,fishing a'&#xD;
fractured pipe from-the stick-chimney, and rap-&#xD;
ping the bowl on his thumb-nail. "Go up' you,&#xD;
and, ask Lowenthal' about, him.' Them as can't.&#xD;
say' 'Cotton is king' 'is no company'for me.""&#xD;
- '" Tell ye what i" said Angelite, 'resolutely,&#xD;
"it doesn't make the leasteat differenceto them-&#xD;
that hasn't got no-cotton, nor no-niggers. You,&#xD;
can't lose aheap, war or no-war.' ',You're- one&#xD;
o' them poor whites that's jes' outside all!crea&#xD;
tion. So what's the good talkin' ?"- j-&#xD;
Although secretly glad to hear'this-rebuke,it&#xD;
put Milrose in.a panic.&#xD;
Ben filled his pipe, and thrust it into aconer&#xD;
of- his mouth.&#xD;
" Dick !!" he muttered. " Dick the-truhipeter.&#xD;
That's youI" 'He' nodded toward Angeline: .&#xD;
"A trifle larger bay 'nor Tom.- Longer' anl -&#xD;
sarcier. Cottonand niggersiye! bothetin' about!&#xD;
Wall, I ha'n't got nary one; but if -'t had been&#xD;
'totherwise, I inight.a had millions d'~hales o'&#xD;
one, and thousands o' 4'other." So : blow yer&#xD;
trumpet ag'in, if yer likes."&#xD;
Ben bur-:ed .1:1' top of his iend -iii smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
His mouth, seen through the tobacco-fdgs, look-&#xD;
ed. like a rift in the chimney.&#xD;
"'Don't be -imipertinent to the gentlemakn,"&#xD;
said Rose;- Wishing' to smooth "matters.&#xD;
"Don't be worried, comrade. Know how to&#xD;
take care of myself. Carry some'little fellows&#xD;
under my jacket that are a heap o' company."&#xD;
Angeline tapped herself on the breast with a&#xD;
wise air.. "&#xD;
"-We army chaps," she added, complacently;&#xD;
" have' to be- right smart with pistols and things.&#xD;
Shot 'a dozen times the other 'day at a soldier'i&#xD;
cap,.and you could cover.the whole of 'em with&#xD;
the palm of your hand. But that's nothin' to&#xD;
what I could do-when I's in practice. Don't&#xD;
want to hurt 'nobody, any ways." -Angeline&#xD;
yawned, and appeared ve  much at ease.&#xD;
'- The apathetic -eyes 'of rs. Dykes wandered&#xD;
from Milrose"to Angeline. There was faseina-&#xD;
tion in the voices of the delicate youths. What&#xD;
associations, they awakened' in her lonely life,&#xD;
none may know.&#xD;
Ben inhaled his cheeks' 'full of smoke, and&#xD;
blew it out- with-a great deal of-importance.' H&#xD;
was .reparing to be belligerent.&#xD;
" ''m Ben Dykes," quoth he. "Ben Dykes,&#xD;
the squatte-Ben Dykes, the howlin' dervish of&#xD;
the pine-woods--Ben Dykes, dog-trainer, nigger-&#xD;
hunter, shoulder-hitter, Confederate, .and what&#xD;
not-?"  He- stretched his' ragged legs, and his&#xD;
ragged arms deliberately, and wrinkled a threat-&#xD;
ening frown from the'bridge of his nose to the&#xD;
hair on his' forehead. "I'm a nat'ral suv'reign"&#xD;
of the 'sile," 'he resumed. " I Can sleep all,&#xD;
night'and fast all day, or'I can eat all-night and'&#xD;
sleep all day. I can eat any kind o' grub, frora&#xD;
a leg 'o' bacon to a b'iled owl. I can outdrink&#xD;

S"'Mrs.' Dykes -sighed. * A sickly croak came&#xD;
from' the child, while' two young hounds qua-&#xD;

S-"'You talk:right smart,'Mr.. Tykes," replied&#xD;
Angeline, coolly. -" You're el'ar grit, anyways.&#xD;
Why don't ye listi ?' '- Lord's mercy! what' i&#xD;
seatterin' you'd make 'mong the Yankees'i&#xD;
Come;' go down yon and 'jive."&#xD;
- When I ant advice, I'll ask for't,"said Ben&#xD;
somewhat iiollified. 'As for Lowenthal, I know&#xD;
hibi-'-right well:'; If-I'in't his right-hand man,&#xD;
prehaps you-can tell mewho is. What I dun-&#xD;
no 'bout this yerwar, 'wouldn't be worth goin'&#xD;
to the door to-fiind out. 'These great milit'iy&#xD;
.men have-to have confidential agents, to pull&#xD;

mind ye, I say nothing . I hate bragging' worse 'n&#xD;

an army. Mebbe t'otherwise ! Ask them that&#xD;
dunno. Ask the fust man you overtake coming'&#xD;
.towards ye."&#xD;
" Love o' God !" exclaimed Angeline. "'Pears&#xD;
like you're the mainstay of this here resurrec-&#xD;
tion. When the Yankees land at Port Royal,&#xD;
you must go down with your pups. But it's&#xD;
about time for Tom and I to be going' to camp.&#xD;
You see, we. was on the way to Brimlow's, and&#xD;
got turned round- in the darkness. Perhaps&#xD;
you'll jes' put us in the path ; and for your&#xD;
trouble, you shall have a long pull at my can-&#xD;
teen whenever you come to the quarters of the&#xD;
Palmetto Guard."&#xD;
"And I'll speak a good word for you to Col-&#xD;
onel Lovelace," said Melrose.&#xD;
" Thank'e, drummer !" responded Ben, grin-&#xD;
ning the whole width of his mouth. " P'r'aps&#xD;
I shall jes' mention ye to Lowenthal. Who,&#xD;
knows but he'1 permote ye?  'Twouldn't be&#xD;
queer if he E hould give ye a high sitywation !"&#xD;
Milrose thought of the prison at the top of&#xD;
the house. There was something horribly re-&#xD;
pulsive and sinister about sthe wide-mouthed&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"He'd take mightily to a little cock-robin&#xD;
like you--Lowenthal would. Do for a page.&#xD;
Could hold his stirrup, or toddle arter him with&#xD;
his sword. Great military people are fond o&#xD;
pooty boys. Goddlemity !"&#xD;
Milrose shivered. What did he mean?-&#xD;
"The war'l1 be a short one," he we on,&#xD;
with a low buckle. "We'll send out drum&#xD;
and trumpet, and sound a parley. What arms&#xD;
we've got in our army! And what legs, also !"&#xD;
Ben's eyes rolled leisurely and exultingly over&#xD;
Milrose.  He- was about to proceed with his&#xD;
startling pleasantry, when the door of the hut&#xD;
creaked on its wooden sockets, and Swampsey&#xD;
stalked solemnly in. He had approached so&#xD;
softly, that even the dogs had not heard him.&#xD;
Some of the hounds, to vindicate their watch-&#xD;
fulness and training, arose, snuffed round him,&#xD;
and growled. But the little foundling of Alli-&#xD;
gator Swamp was undismayed. While Milrose's&#xD;
features expressed wonder, -Ben's swarthy face1&#xD;
evinced decided dissatisfaction.&#xD;
S What you here for?  Who sent ye, yer lit-&#xD;
tle rat ?" he demanded.&#xD;
Swampsey looked steadily around him, .and&#xD;
took in quietly the whole scene. On Milrose&#xD;
and Angeline his eyes finally settled.  He did&#xD;
notdanswer Ben's questions, and that free-born&#xD;
lord of the barrens grew impatient. The spu-&#xD;
rious Ton and Disk were afraid to speak.to the&#xD;
black pigmy, whose fixed gaze was every mo-&#xD;
ient growing- embarrassing.&#xD;
'Come 'long," said Swampsey, presently.&#xD;
Come along where?" Angeline asked.&#xD;
"Come 'long Swampsey.&#xD;
&#xD;
31&#xD;
&#xD;
" Do you know the way ?" she added.&#xD;
"Know the way," drawled Swampsey, wink.&#xD;
ing and blinking violently. "Come 'long&#xD;
white folks I"&#xD;
" He knows the way," said Milrose, eagerly&#xD;
"and he will do just as well for a guide as an'&#xD;
older person."&#xD;
Swampsey bobbed his head perseveringly.&#xD;
"Git out, you stunted mud-nigger!" roar-&#xD;
ed Dykes, quite disturbed. " If you ain't out&#xD;
o' this yer in a minute, I'll set the dogs onto&#xD;
ye!"&#xD;
Swampsey looked wishfully at Milrose, who,&#xD;
arismng, said :&#xD;
" Thank you, Dykes, for the shelter of your&#xD;
hut. We won't trouble you farther. The boy,&#xD;
I think, knows the way to camp. Don't let the&#xD;
dogs hurt him"&#xD;
, Ben jumped from his block and seemed per-&#xD;
plexed and dubious. That he did not wish his&#xD;
visitors to go, 'was evident. Milrose trembled&#xD;
for the result.&#xD;
"'Tisn't near mornin' yet," the man mutter-&#xD;
ed, scowling wrathfully at Swampsey. " But&#xD;
if ye choose to foller this yer imp in the tow&#xD;
shirt, why, foller ; but if ye git lost, don't blame&#xD;
me for't."&#xD;
This acquiescence came in so surly a manner,&#xD;
that Milrose's fears were rather increased than&#xD;
allayed. She perceived in him an unwilling-&#xD;
ness to lose sig ht of them.&#xD;
Swampseyflung a somerset over three dogs,&#xD;
and was out of the hut in a second. The girls&#xD;
did not linger. It was yet dark, but the dark-&#xD;
ness was welcome. Milrose went panting from&#xD;
the thick,' choking atmosphere within, -to the&#xD;
clear, reviving air without. Never had she ex-&#xD;
perienced such relief. She heard Dykes quiet-&#xD;
. encouta ing the negro-hounds to attack their&#xD;
little friend; but for some singular reason, they&#xD;
smelled around him without offering him harm.&#xD;
Giving the frisky quadrupeds no notice, Swamp-&#xD;
sey set his face in a particular direction, and&#xD;
led off. 'As lie trudged along, he seemed to&#xD;
Milrose like a small black speck in the path.&#xD;
When they were some distance from the but,&#xD;
Angeline asked:&#xD;
" W here you going , Swampsey "&#xD;
Gon' 'long," he replied.&#xD;
"Know you're goin' along ; but where you&#xD;
takin' us ? Don't' want to be lost in the woods&#xD;
ag'in," persisted Angeline.&#xD;
"Won't be lost," :nswered- Swampsey.&#xD;
"What do you think you're doin', anyway?"&#xD;
cried the girl, losing patience.&#xD;
"doin' to'Mars'r Peter," said the boy.&#xD;
"Who sent you ?" asked Milrose.&#xD;
"Mars'r Peter."&#xD;
"'Tell ye what !" protested Angeline. " This&#xD;
toddlepole can't say nothin' but ' Mars'r Petei-!&#xD;
Mars'r Peter!' Look here, you talkin' authom-&#xD;

natural swaggering style.-&#xD;
" I do not want you!" answered Milrose,&#xD;
curtly. " Go your way., If you interrupt us,&#xD;
it will be at-your peril."&#xD;
" What a incident it is!" retorted Ben. "It's&#xD;
a event for a cent'ry, this yer is! I'll be dog-&#xD;
goned if 'tisn't too rich for the stomach."&#xD;
The wide mouth grew fearfully facetious.&#xD;
" This way, my warriors ! This way, my ca-&#xD;
nary-legged musicioners ! Know every foot of&#xD;
the piney-woods-I do. No danger gittin' lost.&#xD;
Be in a beautiful shanty, fast thing yoij-dunno.&#xD;
Lead ye through this yer straight asan arrer&#xD;
the darkest night."&#xD;
" Choose your path, and begone !" replied&#xD;
Milrose, with surprising steadiness. " We stir&#xD;
not at your bidding."&#xD;
" Come along, or I shall have to fetch ye !"&#xD;
exclaimed Ben, advancing upon Milrose. She&#xD;
shrank from him, and looked hopelessly for&#xD;
Swam psey. The man seized her wrist, and&#xD;
dragged her forward. The climax of misfortune&#xD;
seemed to be reached. She struggled resolutely ;&#xD;
but his hand was harder than the pine trees, and&#xD;
held her remorselessly. , She thought her wrist-&#xD;
bones were being crushed in his greedy grasp.&#xD;
She knew her secret was out. She perceived&#xD;
that no common-motive was moving Dykes' con-&#xD;
duct. A powerful spell was on him, and there&#xD;
was a frightful zeal in every action. He appear-&#xD;
ed as one under the intoxication of hasheesh.&#xD;
Here was the parallel of the dove and the&#xD;
hawk. The one was fluttering, and exerting its&#xD;
feeble strength in unavailing resistance ; the&#xD;
other, fierce and pitiless, had fixed its talons, and&#xD;
was bearing off its prey.&#xD;
She entreated ; she threatened, and called for&#xD;
help. The barrens echoed to her voice.&#xD;
Angeline, in a position entirely new, her mind&#xD;
muddled with superstitious fears, proved utterly&#xD;
useless. She might, perhaps, have thrown her-&#xD;
self upon Ben,- had not the two hounds, Jeff&#xD;
and Beau, smelled around her as if their nos-&#xD;
trils had caught the scent of Negro blood.&#xD;
She had a wholesome dread of trained dogs.&#xD;
She had seen runaways brought back, torn and&#xD;
worried. - She could not forget the terror of those&#xD;
unfortunates. She loved her mistress, and she&#xD;
did make a fight with her fears.&#xD;
As Dykes led on his victim, she followed, at&#xD;
first moaning and muttering, and finally, find.&#xD;
ing herself actually alive and uninjured, hurling&#xD;
all manner of epithets at Ben, who, leaving the&#xD;
beaten path, pushed into the woods as fast as he&#xD;
could urge the unwilling feet of Milrose.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
THE   MESSENGER.&#xD;
The moment Lowenthal left Peter Rust in such&#xD;
a state of uncertainty, a messenger arrived on a&#xD;
reeking horse, and pushing aside the guard that&#xD;
opposed his entrance, strode hurriedly into the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
iJ~&#xD;
it&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
mansion. Hearing quick, heayy steps in the&#xD;
hall, Lowenthal went to meet the uneeremos-&#xD;
ous visitor, in whom he recognized a Confeder-&#xD;
ate officer.&#xD;
"Colonel Lovelace ?" exclaimed Lowenthal.&#xD;
"This is an unexpected pleasure. What brings&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
They shook hands.&#xD;
"A horse, covered with foam, which requires&#xD;
careful grooming," replied the officer, excited-&#xD;
ly. "The Yankee fleet has appeared on our&#xD;
coast. We 'are expecting an attack at Port.&#xD;
Royal!"&#xD;
" So near !" said Lowenthal, with a start.&#xD;
" They have threatened us a long time ; but I&#xD;
doubted whether their temerity would lead them&#xD;
so far. They never can pass Hilton Head. We&#xD;
have soil enough to bury them on if they effect&#xD;
a landing, colonel !"&#xD;
" We care not thus to enrich our soil !" an-&#xD;
swered Lovelace, with a shrug.&#xD;
"I wish Lincoln would send down asn army&#xD;
of gentlemen. It's too bad to put us to killing&#xD;
cobblers, tinkers, and tailors !" said Lowenthal.&#xD;
" You are a great deal spattered and blown,&#xD;
a.lonel. I hope there's no panic down there."&#xD;
"Panics are for Manassas. We leave those&#xD;
for the ' On to Richmond' people !"&#xD;
Lovelace laughed.&#xD;
"I was just sitting down to breakfast. A cup&#xD;
of coffee, I am sure, will be acceptable to you.&#xD;
This way."&#xD;
Colonel Lovelace threw off his military over-&#xD;
coat and cap, and in a moment had his military&#xD;
legs under Lowenthal's table. The planter&#xD;
touched a bell, and a colored girl came in to&#xD;
serve.&#xD;
Lovelace looked at Lowenthal inquiringly.&#xD;
"Babel is away," said the latter, answering&#xD;
the glance, "but you need not fear to speak&#xD;
freely. My slaves never leave th  plantation."&#xD;
" That black Goliah was might co enient,"&#xD;
replied the colonel, " because he ould betray&#xD;
no secrets. Pity the whole race wasn't deaf and&#xD;
dumb ! But we couldn't make soldiers of them&#xD;
inthat case."&#xD;
"You have not come for nothing. May I ask&#xD;
your business, colonel ?"&#xD;
" Hurry up the men ! Everything and every-&#xD;
body must be pressed into the service as rapid-&#xD;
ly as possible. We must arm the slaves. Your&#xD;
niggers '1l fight, won't they ?"&#xD;
" I don't know," answered Lowenthal, reflect.&#xD;
ively. A "Our traditions say they'll fight for&#xD;
their masters. We have many pretty legends&#xD;
about the devotion of our chattels. I should&#xD;
think they'd, fight to perpetuate their bond-&#xD;
age !"&#xD;
Lowenthal looked at Lovelace very meaning-&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
"A slave chain and an overseer's whip ought&#xD;
to be the device on their banner."&#xD;
. Lovelace smiled over this pleasant conceit.&#xD;

&#xD;
MILROSE ; OR, THE COTTON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Thee loves the whip, friend Roscoe ;' and,,&#xD;
truly, there is a sweet music in it, as it goes&#xD;
humming through the air. He that spareth the&#xD;
rod spoileth the child. These black Saxons are&#xD;
our children, and we do not well if we beat&#xD;
them not soundly."&#xD;
Broadbent sighed, and turned his eyes up-&#xD;
ward. He had a long face just then.&#xD;
"This is edifying !" sneered Lovelace.&#xD;
"In referring to the whip; friend Roseoe, thou&#xD;
unwittingly touched an interesting article of my&#xD;
faith. I believe in scourgings oft. The whip is&#xD;
the great expounder of knotty questions. It is&#xD;
a mighty reasoner. It overcometh the flesh&#xD;
and the devil. It is sharper than a two-edged&#xD;
sword it, layeth bare the back, and divideth the&#xD;
skin and the muscles."&#xD;
Broadbent stopped, and made a longer face&#xD;
than before.&#xD;
" A false mercy," he went on, "often doeth&#xD;
mischief. Too much tenderness is a devilsto&#xD;
be cast out. The negro is subordinate unto&#xD;
man."&#xD;
" Subordinate unto man !" repeated Lovelace,&#xD;
with a queer look.&#xD;
" Being thrown upon our protection," resum-&#xD;
ed Martin, with growing fervor, "like his breth-&#xD;
ren of the field, the horse and the ox, it becomes&#xD;
our duty to teach him obedience.  The resem-&#xD;
blance of the negro to man should not mislead&#xD;
us.' ,&#xD;
" By no means !" observed Lovelace, highly&#xD;
entertained by Martin's singular views.&#xD;
" To subject the black to the arts of industry,&#xD;
and make him useful to the human race, is in-&#xD;
deed a benevolent object. Let the whip swing ;&#xD;
let it hum and whistle from morning till might;&#xD;
let it cut and scarify, flay and blister, mince and&#xD;
macerate, till the brute instincts of the man-&#xD;
animal be subdued, conquered, and extinguished!&#xD;
They are unworthy masters and mistresses who&#xD;
are startled at the sight of blood. I tell thee,&#xD;
friend Roscoe, that the whip is the schoolmaster&#xD;
of the negro ; it is his book, his education, his&#xD;
monitor, his conscience, and his savior."&#xD;
The voice of Martin was steady, -cold, and&#xD;
calm. There was no pity and mercy in it.&#xD;
Lowenthal stared at hium in strange perplexity.&#xD;
Be thought he could fathom men ; but here&#xD;
was one whose depths he was not sure he could&#xD;
sound. He did not know what to say, or how&#xD;
to deal with him.&#xD;
" This person is getting horrible !" said Love-&#xD;
lace, moving his- chair. "He has the cold-&#xD;
blooded cruelty of the North, without thIe i-&#xD;
pulsiveness of the South. He should whip no&#xD;
nigger of mine !"&#xD;
"The- horse and the harness,- the ox and the&#xD;
yoke, must be well acquainted," said Martin.&#xD;
" The beast that is best broken does the most&#xD;
work, and takes to it most kindly. The relation&#xD;
of man and negro is not one o' mutual agree-&#xD;
ment. It is the relation of Force. I know my&#xD;
&#xD;
business. I subdue the black animal, or the&#xD;
black animal subdues me. I see the stern al-&#xD;
ternative. You must trample ambition out of&#xD;
him. Therefore, I say flagellate, flog, cut,&#xD;
slash, and, if necessary, shoot, hang, and burn !"&#xD;
Broadbent's eyes, which had been fixed in&#xD;
thoughtful contemplation on the ceiling, rolled&#xD;
calmly down upon Lowenthal, who was studying&#xD;
him with all his powers of concentration.&#xD;
" He's just my- man," muttered the planter,&#xD;
"or he's not my man at all."&#xD;
" Impassive devil !" said Lovelace.&#xD;
"I give you carte blanche," said the planter,&#xD;
by and by. " Whip and pickle to your heart's&#xD;
content. If you hear any mutinous talk, shoot,&#xD;
and welcome. And it would be well to creep&#xD;
among the quarters at night to see whits going&#xD;
on. There are alarming whispers on the wind.&#xD;
Servile insurrections are feared.  We don't&#xD;
want our throats cut by our slaves. The Yan-&#xD;
kee fleet is off Port Royal, the colonel informs&#xD;
me, and there's likely to be fighting. Allow&#xD;
not a hand to leave the plantation. Don't let&#xD;
them be loitering about, and have them in their&#xD;
huts at dark. ny-the-by, how is that runaway&#xD;
girl that Dykes brought in the day before yes-&#xD;
terday ? You didn't quite finish her, I suppose ?"&#xD;
" She is an example to all that behold her.&#xD;
The dogs, perhaps, took hold somewhat sharper&#xD;
than was needful, and in my wrath I was rather&#xD;
too free with the rod, considering that she was&#xD;
weak from fasting and weariness ; tnt she can&#xD;
lie on her face with tolerable case, and if fever&#xD;
does not set in, she will be well in a few weeks.&#xD;
I am not a hard man, friend Roscoe."&#xD;
" A very lamb !" muttered Lovelace.&#xD;
"One word more," added Martin. "I would&#xD;
have the man Benjamin, whose surname is&#xD;
Dykes, use more discretion in the taking of run-&#xD;
aways. . It is not well to have them returned&#xD;
bitten, and so faint from loss of blood that&#xD;
the whip cannot be profitably employed.. I&#xD;
know my business."&#xD;
" I think you may be trusted," answered&#xD;
Lowenthal, deliberately. le then arose and&#xD;
walked with Martin to the door. " If you prove&#xD;
what you seem, you have a friend in me. If&#xD;
you play the hypocrite, the devil may be soon-&#xD;
or-deceived than I. I may have work for you-&#xD;
confidential work. That Peter Rust has not&#xD;
not turned out well. He's a mule!"&#xD;
Broadbent nodded, as if he understood.&#xD;
" Nothing goes on up there as I expected,"&#xD;
added the planter, with a lowering of the voice,&#xD;
and an upward motion. "If I call on you for&#xD;
aid, there will be a secret to keep. A short&#xD;
time will determine. Go, and look well to your&#xD;
business.&#xD;
"Fear not for me," responded Martin, with&#xD;
that puzzling equanimity and steadiness that,&#xD;
at times, were so baffling to the planter. "In&#xD;
truth, I will be prudent, discreet, circumspect,&#xD;
and, as I may say, wary."&#xD;

events.  The same stillness prevailed in the1&#xD;
slave-quarters that was observable when he&#xD;
passed over the same ground a.short time be-&#xD;
fore. As he approached the mansion, he threw&#xD;
inquiring looks upward to the window where&#xD;
Peter Rust was in custody. There was no light.&#xD;
there. A light had burned there the previous&#xD;
night, which he had watched with interest. IHis&#xD;
suggestive brain shaped many.conjectures as hs&#xD;
drew -ear that bouse-of mystery. It was dark,&#xD;
lark. He stopped nesr the angle of thegable.&#xD;
lie heard a sound:like the 4 rattling -of cordage,,&#xD;
or the creaking off.a gate, and ~by fixing his,&#xD;
eyes steadfastly, he discerned ;a dark object,&#xD;

was a little black dog, hut which preyed to be.&#xD;
a little black boy, in a tow-shirt, followed him.&#xD;
"Thank Heaven I" muttered Martin.  4' A&#xD;
burden'is lifted from my conscience."&#xD;
Passing to the rear of the house, he crossed&#xD;
the garden and entered by a private .door.&#xD;
Without knowing it;,he .passed Milrose and An-&#xD;
geline in the dark, narrow hall. He went di-&#xD;
rectly to the top of the dwelling, where Babel&#xD;
was keeping his silent vigil. lie found him&#xD;
asleep. .Laying his hand on his shoulder, he&#xD;
said :.             L&#xD;
"c Awake, Babel !"       '&#xD;
The black clutched his.blunderbuss, and leap-&#xD;
.edautomatically tohis feet..&#xD;
-'Come, BabelI"..&#xD;
The giant rubbed his-eyes,&#xD;
"'Shake off thy stupor," resumed Martin. "I&#xD;
have need of thee."     ,.&#xD;
Babel looked at him hnquir'ingly.,. ...&#xD;
" Thou mayst -have tongue ani ears," added&#xD;
the overseer. C Lowenthal rode away in haste&#xD;

"Leave your gun.ant follow me."&#xD;
" To death,my master I"   ,       .&#xD;
Placing his blunderbuss against the wall, he&#xD;
went with Martin submissively. No'nmore was&#xD;
said till they reached the: hut where Ela and&#xD;
the body were..&#xD;
"MJast kept thy courage ?"&#xD;
"il have kept the sh;lows behind me," re-&#xD;
plied Ela.  f' Think of yourself.  Here-is a&#xD;

W.heniver Martin said to her, " Be calm," shne&#xD;

her being mysterious energy.&#xD;
"Tiabel" hsespid, pointing to the body, "be-&#xD;

The black:uncovered he face and examined it.&#xD;
'« What tlijnkest, Ba el ?"&#xD;

"Fear her not. Thy tongue must. ache with&#xD;

 "M ster, when you bidme,,I speak."&#xD;
 "A ngral e" exclaimed Ela. "The deaf&#xD;

'a sIna seen Babel; thep ?" asked Martin, sur-&#xD;
spriped.&#xD;

:that this deed was done.&#xD;
l'ot for theeonly. The world will be bet-&#xD;

'Master," said Babel, " since I may talk, it&#xD;
shall-be to the point.; I think'I can take care of&#xD;
this. But I must wash off the black."&#xD;
" Do as thou wilt.,I, can trust thee," Martin&#xD;
replied, watching the negro's countenanee close-&#xD;
ly. "Peter Rust has escaped. I did not te.1&#xD;
thee, but hie is free."&#xD;
"' hst .is good   i thought he would get&#xD;
away, and ,it; better for my, plan."&#xD;
The black went for water, and returning vitlh&#xD;
some, washed the, burnt-vork from the dead,&#xD;
man's face' and hands. -lie then took up the&#xD;
body, and started off with it. Martin. follow-&#xD;
ed him. lie carried his burden toward, the&#xD;
hone.&#xD;
" Babel ! Babel ! What wo'uldsL thou do ?"&#xD;
wbispered Martin.&#xD;
"Master, you said you would trust me," an&#xD;
swered the black, pausing just beneath the-win-&#xD;
dow from which Peter Rust haa escaped.&#xD;
.  " es; I remember," returned Martin, reflce-&#xD;
t-ively. " I-will not call my words."&#xD;
Just then his hand touched the rope that still&#xD;
angled; from the window.&#xD;
" Ah I, what is this?" he s mid. "It is the&#xD;
rope by which Peter descended."&#xD;
"Give me the end of it, master," said Babel.&#xD;
Martin handed him the end of the rope, and&#xD;
making a noose in it, Babel slipped it under the&#xD;
armas of the dead man.&#xD;
"Come, master. My work is above, now."&#xD;
Babelburried through the private door and&#xD;
the winding staircase to the-place where iebhad&#xD;
kept watch, Martin at his heels. He lighted a&#xD;
lamp that hung in the passage, and.drawing the&#xD;
ousteribolt of the door, threw "himself against it&#xD;
with sueh force that the inside fastenings gave&#xD;
way. What could withstand those broad shop.l&#xD;

MILROSE ; OR, THE COTTON-PLANTER'S.DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
Martin followed his movements with wonder&#xD;
and curiosty. The giant,darted to the window,&#xD;
seized the rope, and drew up the body. It fell&#xD;
into the room like a clod, as it was. Babel un-&#xD;
fastened the rope from the joist, coiled it up, and&#xD;
gave it to Martin, saying :&#xD;
" When you go out, master, put it out of&#xD;
sight."&#xD;
After this, he shut the window, and dragging&#xD;
the body, proceeded to place it a little upon one&#xD;
side, with one arm partly under the head, where,&#xD;
in his judgment, Peter Rust would have fallen,&#xD;
had Lowenthal's shot taken effect. When he&#xD;
had arranged the corpse carefully and skillfully,&#xD;
he directed Martin's attention to the bullet-hole&#xD;
in the door ; and the overseer began to com-&#xD;
prehend his purpose.&#xD;
"1Master, it is done," said Babel. - "He lays&#xD;
as if a ball through that door had killed him.&#xD;
You see, he was shot through the head, and&#xD;
died without a struggle. Master, have I done&#xD;
weil?"&#xD;
" Thou hast done well!"'!&#xD;
Leaving the prison, Babel closed the door,&#xD;
pushed the bolt, and resumed his blunderbuss.&#xD;
While Martin was going back to the hut, he&#xD;
heard Lowenthal returning.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
IN JUDGMENT.&#xD;
Lowenthal came home excited, and in on ex-&#xD;
ultant mood. He drank deeply, ate nothing,&#xD;
went to bed, slept heavily, and awoke in the&#xD;
morning with a headache, and in a detestable&#xD;
temper. Having breakfasted with Colonel Love-&#xD;
lace, he had a prisoner brought in for examin-&#xD;
tion. Though holding no regular commission&#xD;
from the psuedo Confederate Government, he&#xD;
exerted an authority that was sometimes both&#xD;
lawless and summary. The man who controls a&#xD;
few'hundred negroes and a plantation which you.&#xD;
cannot see across with a glass, is, in all essentials,&#xD;
an autocrat and a despot.&#xD;
The person brought in to be interrogated and&#xD;
adjudged, was a young man of twenty-six or&#xD;
seven, of good figure and firm bearing. His&#xD;
complexion was clear, his face exhibiting none&#xD;
of those marks of dissipation that characterize&#xD;
men of free ideas and convivial habits. Al-&#xD;
though pale, he had by no means a sickly or&#xD;
effeminate look. He had calm eyes, and a&#xD;
quick, vigorous intellect.&#xD;
He appeared in the presence of Lowenthal&#xD;
and Lovelace, guarded by three tall, stoop-&#xD;
shouldered fellows in gray clothes. Lowenthal&#xD;
put a glass to his eye, and looked him over&#xD;
superciliously. He was about to make an in-&#xD;
sulting remark, when a servant announced that,&#xD;
there was a gentleman at the door who desired&#xD;
to see him immediately.&#xD;
"1Let him wait !" said Lowenthal.&#xD;
The servant replied that the person would not&#xD;
be refused.&#xD;
&#xD;
"We will see," said the planter, frowning.&#xD;
"Begone !"&#xD;
The slave was backing tremblingly from the&#xD;
room, when he was unceremoniously thrust&#xD;
aside by the person seeking audience. He en-&#xD;
tered, followed by a stout negro. He was a&#xD;
man of middle age, with black eyebrows, gray&#xD;
hair, and long gray beard. He : wore green&#xD;
spectacles, which concealed the color and ex-&#xD;
pression of the eyes. Had it not been for the&#xD;
silvery beard, one might have said tuat there&#xD;
was a young face on an old head.&#xD;
This not-to-be-denied visitor was of slight-&#xD;
figure, yet strikingly compact and shapely.&#xD;
His motions were remarkably quick and springy&#xD;
for one of his age. Resolution and decision&#xD;
marked every look and gesture.&#xD;
The negro who attended him was taller than&#xD;
Babel, straight as a flag-staff, and in symmetry&#xD;
a bronze Hyperion. The African lips, the flat-&#xD;
tened nose, the low forehead, the crispy hair,&#xD;
were entirely wanting ; there being substituted&#xD;
for them, comely lips, a straight nose, a broad&#xD;
brow, and dark hair. His skiff was of a soft&#xD;
yellow, by no means displeasing. There was a&#xD;
certain air of repose in his features, that indi-&#xD;
cated self-reliance and power. He was plainly&#xD;
yet respectably dressed. He kept very near his&#xD;
master.&#xD;
Lowenthal was annoyed at this intrusion, and&#xD;
whatever feeling counseled forbearance, it was&#xD;
not good will.&#xD;
" Markthaler, I think your business would&#xD;
have kept," were his first words of greeting,&#xD;
spoken ungraciously.&#xD;
"Business !" replied the other. "That is a&#xD;
word I like to hear. Come ; let us attend to it&#xD;
at once."&#xD;
" I am  busy. Matters of state at present&#xD;
occupy my attention. When the safety of the&#xD;
Confederacy is concerned, I have no time of my&#xD;
own," answered Lowenthal, leveling his glass&#xD;
again at the prisoner. " You will oblige me,"&#xD;
he added, " by retiring a few moments, while I&#xD;
question this suspicious person."&#xD;
"Pardon me, sir," said Markthaler, familiar-&#xD;
ly. " What is your business is also mine. Our&#xD;
interests are somewhat the same, I think. If&#xD;
the South goes to the devil, I suppose you and&#xD;
L individually and respectively, will go with it.&#xD;
So I will just sit down here and look over my&#xD;
papers, while you look over your - man there,&#xD;
with his hands tied. Jacob, stand behind me."&#xD;
Markthaler dropped himself carelessly into&#xD;
the~ easiest chair in the room, and the yellow&#xD;
Apollo placed himself behind him.&#xD;
Lowenthal gnawed his lips with vexation.&#xD;
.Lovelace looked from one to the other in su-&#xD;
preme surprise. He was not accustomed to&#xD;
hear Lowenthal addressed so cavalierly. He&#xD;
whispered :&#xD;
"Throw him out of the window!"&#xD;
"Unfortunately," muttered the planter surli-&#xD;

ly, lie's the only man in the world that I can't&#xD;
throw out of the window."&#xD;
" What is he ?" Leoelace asked, in the same&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
neA money-devil! A d-d blood-sucker !"&#xD;
answered Lo'wentha1, setting'his teeth together.&#xD;
"Can you not get along without blood-suck-&#xD;
ers ?" Lovelace inquired, still more surprised.&#xD;
" Your fortune is princely. You can buy all&#xD;
all the usurers in the- country,".he added.&#xD;
" It's an extroardinary crisis," answered the&#xD;
planter, flushing, "ud-and,-in short, I need&#xD;
money. Loans are sometimes wonderfuly con-&#xD;
venient."&#xD;
Lovelace scanned the planter's face for a mo-&#xD;
ment, and said no more.-&#xD;
"Pray don't heed me," said Markthaler, pull-&#xD;
ing some papers from his coat-pocket. " While&#xD;
you are sending your suspicious fellow to be&#xD;
shot or hanged, I shall afhuse myself very well&#xD;
with these columns of figures.. hope you feel&#xD;
quite well, my dear Lowenthal. You have those&#xD;
heats. and chills yet, I observe. You should&#xD;
take quinine. -Quinine is the stuff for these in-&#xD;
terinittents.''&#xD;
The planter clutched the arms of his chair&#xD;
with his white hands, and tried to look tran-&#xD;
quil&#xD;
"I have no need of money-devils," said Love-&#xD;
lace, leaning toward the planter.. " I can throw&#xD;
him out of the window as well as not."&#xD;
The colonel started toward Markthaler, as if&#xD;
he meant to put his threat in execution.&#xD;
The first obstacle he met, were the eyes 'of&#xD;
Jacob, which beamed on him like infernal fur-&#xD;
naces; the second was' the voice of Lowenthal&#xD;
calling him back.&#xD;
" Colonel Lovelace, I think ?" said the ,money-&#xD;
changer, nodding slightly. "Happy to meet&#xD;
ou, sir. You'll look out for the Yankee fleet,&#xD;
I'll warrant.A&#xD;
Lovelace returned to his seat, unaccountably&#xD;
put down and baffled. He was dissatisfied with&#xD;
Lowenthal and with himself.&#xD;
" Heed not the usurer, colonel. Money-lend-&#xD;
ers, like death, cannot be done away with. Peo-&#xD;
ple must die and be buried, you know, which is&#xD;
a great nuisance," said the planter, in a hurried&#xD;
under-tone. Then to the prisoner : " Young&#xD;
man, look at me. I want your attention."&#xD;
The prisoner turned upon Lowenthal eyes so&#xD;
clear and steady that he was confused, and be-&#xD;
trayed more guilt than the accused.&#xD;
"What is your name ?" he demanded.&#xD;
" Frederick North. Had it been unknown to&#xD;
you, you could have asked it with better grace,"&#xD;
replied the young man&#xD;
" Confine your remarks to the questions," re&#xD;
turned the planter, haughtily. "As for know-&#xD;
ing people, my knowledge is usually limited to&#xD;
gentlemen."&#xD;
" Of what am I accused ?" asked North.&#xD;
" Of everything but loyalty to the Confeder&#xD;
&#xD;
acy," retorted Lowenthal. "There are but two&#xD;
classes of people among us, friends and foes."&#xD;
" You are accused of being a Unionist," said&#xD;
Lovelace.&#xD;
" A dreadful crime I" said a voice, that seem-&#xD;
ed to come from Markthaler's direction.&#xD;
Castingan angry glance that way, Lowenthal&#xD;
saw him busy with his papers.&#xD;
" Are you both accuser and judge ?" Freder-&#xD;
ick demanded.&#xD;
"I can produce witnesses, if necessary ; but&#xD;
it is my pleasure to question you in the Presence&#xD;
of Colonel Lovelace. These are not times to&#xD;
be over nice. In South Carolina we have a re-&#xD;
markably short way of dealing with traitors. It&#xD;
is. well-understood that your language, on sever-&#xD;
al occasions, has been treasonable ; and, in fact,&#xD;
that you are in correspondence with the enemy.&#xD;
I might have had you shot down yesterday&#xD;
when you resisted my men ; but I preferred to,&#xD;
condemn or acquit you out of your own mouth.&#xD;
Were you not lurking about my house, at a late&#xD;
hour, night before last?"&#xD;
"Frederick North's cheeks flushed, and he&#xD;
replied, after a moment of confusion:,&#xD;
" I decline to answer'that question."&#xD;
" You hear, colonel?- He refuses to answer,"&#xD;
observed Lowenthal. "Do you, or do you not,&#xD;
believe in the Confederacy ?" he added.&#xD;
" To what Confederacy do you refer ?" asked&#xD;
North,&#xD;
" To the Confederate States of America !" re-&#xD;
plied the planter, pompously.&#xD;
"I have heard of such. a concern," said&#xD;
Frederick, coolly ; " but I know of no such gov-&#xD;
ernment on earth."&#xD;
" Insolent !" exclaimed Lovelace.&#xD;
" 'Ie ignores the government he lives under !"&#xD;
resumed Lowenthal, with affected astonishment.&#xD;
" Perhaps, young man," he went on, with in-&#xD;
creasing severity of manner, "you will next&#xD;
speak ill of the President, Vice-President, and&#xD;
of the Southern Congress ?"    .     ,&#xD;
" He cannot rise to such a sublimity of infamy&#xD;
as that !" interrupted Markthaler,-with singular&#xD;
sang froid.&#xD;
" Will you mind your business, sir?" cried&#xD;
Lowenthal, quite thrown from his moral equi-&#xD;
librium.&#xD;
"I have never troubled the President or Vice-&#xD;
President," replied Frederick, quietly.  "As&#xD;
for the other thing you mentioned-the South-&#xD;
ern Congress-I have never metit anywhere in&#xD;
my travels. All I wish is liberty and my natur-&#xD;
al rights.  You have seized me like a felon,&#xD;
and dragged me here with violence and insult ;&#xD;
and if the time ver comes when I can meet&#xD;
you face to face, oh equal terms, as man should&#xD;
meet his fellow-man, I will reward your friendly&#xD;
offices as they deserve. At present you have&#xD;
the advantage. You are surrounded by your&#xD;
tools and ruffians, and it-only remains for me to&#xD;

rake out a new thought. " Ye -see, Iwar -set-&#xD;

"That will do, sir ." interposed Lowenthal.&#xD;
Then, to Lovelace: "I hope you are satisfied, ,&#xD;

"I am satisfied that your step-daughter has a&#xD;

temper.&#xD;
"Thar war treason enough todhang a dozen'&#xD;

"There is too much draught on this man,&#xD;
Lowenthal.   Turn his damper," interrupted&#xD;
Markthaler, with a smile and a shrug. Then to&#xD;
Lovelace : ." Which will you punish, colonel;&#xD;
the love or the treason ?"&#xD;
The Confederate officer gnawed his lips and&#xD;
reddened with anger.&#xD;
"I have soldiers within call," he retorted-&#xD;
" and if you should find your way to the guard-&#xD;
house, or the whipping-post, do not be surpris-&#xD;
ed."&#xD;
The tall, symmetrical figure of Jacob loomed&#xD;
higher and higher behind his master's chair.&#xD;
His nostrils expanded, his eyes shot rays of de-&#xD;
fiance.&#xD;
Markthaler sat cool and unmoved, toying with&#xD;
a slip of paper.&#xD;
" You represent," he answered, calmly, "tth.&#xD;
soldier-power, while I represent the cash-power.&#xD;
Cash is ;greater than cotton. Cotton is -local,&#xD;
cash universal. With cash in hand, we marry&#xD;
the prettiest girls, and live in the finest houses."&#xD;
This remark, though quietly -uttered, touched&#xD;
the officer in the most sensitive spot. He wish-&#xD;
ed to marry Milrose, but he had no cotton. He&#xD;
wished to marry Milrose, but he had no negroes.&#xD;
He wished to marry Milrose, but he had no&#xD;
cash. The colonel's chattels had been knocked&#xD;
down by the auctioneer before the siege of&#xD;
Sumter; and his cotton, unfortunately, had&#xD;
perished between the seed and the pod. Had&#xD;
it not been for this, there is no knowing how&#xD;
much he might have been worth. As it was,&#xD;
he sat there with commission from Jeff Davis&#xD;
in his pocket, a large capital of family pride in&#xD;
his head, a good deal of rebellion in his heart,&#xD;
a major-generalship in the distance, and a splen-&#xD;
did sword with which to slay the enemies of the&#xD;
South Carolina Nation.&#xD;
=The colonel, though young, brave, and good-&#xD;
looking, had a heart-disease, and that heart-dis-'&#xD;
ease was Milrose Dorn; and that young lady&#xD;
unconsciously kept him in a painful palpitation&#xD;
of hope and, fear. He had tried to get cured of&#xD;
Milrose, but after several efforts,,yielded to the&#xD;
malady, which had made fearful inroads on his&#xD;
peace of mind.'&#xD;
The singular testimony of Hillhouse revealed&#xD;
to him a secret of which lie had been profound-&#xD;
y ignorant. It astounded him more than a&#xD;
burst of artillery. A feeling of disappointment,&#xD;
mpossible to describe, swept over him ; then&#xD;
came chagrin, and a desire to 'be avenged on&#xD;
some one, and whom so proper a subject of ven.&#xD;

&#xD;
MILROSE ; OR, TIIE COT ION-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
The colonel's regiment was called the Beau-&#xD;
fort Guards ;_ and their camp, which was about&#xD;
a hundred rods from Lowentlal's, had been&#xD;
named Carmp Royal. To Camp Royal Lovelace&#xD;
directed his steps. The regiment was drilling&#xD;
by companies. Notwithstanding the pre-occu-&#xD;
pation of his mind, lie paused and looked at&#xD;
them. Comparisons are natural ; they flow out&#xD;
of one's understanding without effort. The&#xD;
Confederate officer was the subject of these&#xD;
mental calculations. His eyes searched in ivain&#xD;
for large numbers of those chivalrous gentle-&#xD;
men said to have shouldered arms in the de-&#xD;
fence of Southern liberties. Instead of knights-&#xD;
errant in gallant array, lie beheld a motley mass&#xD;
of poor and ignorant men, ill-clad and rough.&#xD;
In the midst of this undisciplined crew, he saw&#xD;
Frederick North, with a gun on shoulder. To&#xD;
his surprise, this new conscript appeared not&#xD;
the least embarrassed or put down. He went&#xD;
through the manual drill with notable proupti-&#xD;
tude and precision. His handsome counte-&#xD;
nance, straight and graceful figure, contrasted&#xD;
strangely with those about him. He made no&#xD;
mistakes, and evidently understood the exercis-&#xD;
es better than the drill-officer.&#xD;
Their eyes met. Lovelace blushed ; North&#xD;
smiled and touched his cap. The former felt&#xD;
no triumph in his advantage. The young man&#xD;
made him think of Bunker Hill and the old&#xD;
flag. He sighed and turned away. Milrbse and&#xD;
the rebellion were still in his heart ; but Milrosc&#xD;
first. His hopes had that morning received a&#xD;
fatal wound. He was amazed at the depth and&#xD;
fervency of his love for Mllrose, which the&#xD;
events of the last hour had revealed to him.&#xD;
He wondered at his own wretchedness. He dis-&#xD;
trusted Lowenthal. He resolved to see Hill-&#xD;
house privately, and question hini closely. -'&#xD;
While thinking of these things, Martin Broad-&#xD;
bent approached him. This man's deportment&#xD;
always drew attention. Wherever he went, peo-&#xD;
ple paused to look at him. This was because&#xD;
le differed from others. He was one of those&#xD;
persons that can be felt when they are near.&#xD;
Lovelace bowed recognition from force of&#xD;
habit.   '°&#xD;
"Truly, friend Lovelace, this is a goodly ar-&#xD;
ray of the chief captains and the mighty men&#xD;
of war," he remarked.&#xD;
"Hunph!" said the colonel, with a slight&#xD;
jerk of the body.      -&#xD;
" These be the men," continued Martin, so-&#xD;
norously. " who take their lives in their hands,&#xD;
and go forth, without purse or scrip, to fight for&#xD;
their substance and their chattels."&#xD;
"They have scrip enough, God knows !" re-&#xD;
torted Lovelace, impatiently.&#xD;
" Thou art captious, friend, and speakest af-&#xD;
ter the manner of the children of this world. I&#xD;
fear thou feelest no enthusiasm at a spectacle&#xD;
'like this."&#xD;
Martin stopped, then went on.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I  pray thee note their warlike bearing.&#xD;
Behold how brightly their bayonets gleam in&#xD;
the sun!"&#xD;
" It happens, unfortunately," said Lovelace,&#xD;
dryly, " that but few of them have bayonets.&#xD;
If a few hundreds of rusty shot-guns gleam,&#xD;
why, then, they gleam."&#xD;
4 Thou carpest again,' resumed Broadbent.&#xD;
" But if thou wilt fault their guns and equip-&#xD;
ments, I will call thy attention to the alacrity&#xD;
of their movements, the perfection of their drill,&#xD;
and the military ardor that inflnes their&#xD;
faces."&#xD;
" You are either a wag, or a great fanati ,&#xD;
Mr. Overseer. I like wholesome praise ; but I&#xD;
have a horror of exaggeration. I can see&#xD;
neither alacrity of movement nor perfection&#xD;
of drill ; and, to speak plainly, their faces are&#xD;
oftener inflamed with whisky than with milita-&#xD;
ry ardor. I should like to find all those manly&#xD;
and soldierly qualities you talk of; but I shall&#xD;
have to look further, I'm afraid. The fact is,&#xD;
these are the dregs of our social system. Few&#xD;
of them are in good condition. Most of then-&#xD;
have been cheated of fair proportions. Low&#xD;
and thriftless habits do not develop 'nianliood.&#xD;
Yonder is a fellow all legs and arms. He is&#xD;
lank and ungainly, lantern-jawed and stoop-&#xD;
shouldered. If you glance around, you will&#xD;
find many like him. It comes of being at the&#xD;
wrong end of the ladder. Now that is not the&#xD;
ngterial for an army."&#xD;
"But, friend Lovelace, the cause will inspire&#xD;
these people. Reflect that all they possess i&#xD;
the world is staked in this contest."&#xD;
" Bali! All they possess in the world wouk&#xD;
not suffice to buy them a pair of brogans eacle  ,&#xD;
said the officer, annoyed by the persistency of&#xD;
Martin.&#xD;
" Thee must remember that slavery is at&#xD;
stake, and that it is necessary to, the cotton in-&#xD;
terest that the negro race should be subject to&#xD;
man."&#xD;
Broaibent looked gravely and calmly at the&#xD;
Confederate officer, who answered, dubiously.&#xD;
" You are a singular person. I wish you&#xD;
would go away."&#xD;
" Truly, friend, I caiinot depart, for here&#xD;
hath Providence east me to labor faithfully for&#xD;
the subjugation of the black Saxon. Yea, it is&#xD;
my duty to strike, whip, castigate, flagellate,&#xD;
and subdue such as are intrusted to ny care.&#xD;
Verily, I will cry aloud and spare not; and&#xD;
reason with them powerfully, even to the cruai-&#xD;
fying of the flesh. I am not a hard man, and I&#xD;
know my business."&#xD;
" I am a Southern man, and a rebel' of the&#xD;
darkest water, but I loathe barbarity. 1 confess&#xD;
I am somewhat .Afraid of you, Mr. Overseer..&#xD;
You know too much or too little, and I have not&#xD;
wit enough to tell 'which. In either case you&#xD;
may be dangerous. My head is not so large as&#xD;
yours, Mr. Broadbent; therefore, we had better&#xD;

&#xD;
keep apart. I go in for fighting, but not for&#xD;
mincing up negroesI"&#xD;
Lovelace folded his arms, and partly turned&#xD;
Ids back on the Quaker.&#xD;
"Thou knowest the maiden called Milrose ?"&#xD;
said Martin, abruptly.&#xD;
Lovelace-was now ready to bear. Martin had&#xD;
touched the right string. [ie turned hastily.&#xD;
" -know Miss Dorn," he said.&#xD;
"I was of that opinion," continued Martin.&#xD;
" What did you wish to say of her?" asked&#xD;
the colonel, somewhat coldly.&#xD;
" Not much, friend Lovelace. She was not&#xD;
quite happy, I thought, when I saw her last.&#xD;
Perhaps the rebellion troubles her, or her prop-&#xD;
erty needs looking after.  Young girls, it is&#xD;
said, find ways to make themselves miserable.&#xD;
And, of a truth, there are gossiping people who&#xD;
tell strange stories ; or, rather, I should say,&#xD;
vague whispers drift in the air, and reach the&#xD;
ears of some, who, verily, may be prying per-&#xD;
sons given to minding the affairs of their neigh-&#xD;
bors," answered Martin, fixing his eyes incident-&#xD;
ally, apparently, on Frederick North.&#xD;
" Your meaning is dark, friend Broadbent,"&#xD;
said the colonel, whose interest was now thor-&#xD;
oughly awakened. " Which way do your sus-&#xD;
pieions point, or what am I to infer from your&#xD;
words? Come, sir ; yius can trust me."&#xD;
"Of a verity, there is a young man in the&#xD;
ranks witlji whose figure and bearing thou canst&#xD;
find no fault. I do not remember to have seen&#xD;
him in the ranks before," observed Martin.&#xD;
" But, as I was saying to thee, the maiden up&#xD;
yonder "-he pointed to the house-" may have&#xD;
more cause for fear and unhappiness than thou&#xD;
thickest. Thou art a man of honor, according&#xD;
to thy prejudices and beliefs ; and I may safely&#xD;
say to thee that the house of Lowenthal has its&#xD;
mysteries."l&#xD;
Lovelace leaned eagerly toward Martin.&#xD;
Every word he uttered was full of startling in-&#xD;
terest.&#xD;
" Do you not know," he said, " that Milrose&#xD;
has disappeared ?"&#xD;
" Heaven give her safety I" exclaimed Mar-&#xD;
tin.                               ,&#xD;
" That implies," remarked Lovelace, thought-&#xD;
fully, "that she has not been safe."&#xD;
" the construction was thine," responded&#xD;
Martin. " Where has the damsel gone ?"&#xD;
" Those who run away, seldom leave word&#xD;
where they are going. Tell me, sir-has Low-&#xD;
enthal,-"&#xD;
"Of Lowenthal I say nothing," interrupted&#xD;
Martin. " Thou hast eyes, and ears, and sense :&#xD;
use them. Why should I take away another&#xD;
man's understanding? Nevertheless, were I an&#xD;
honorable man, desirous of doing good, I would&#xD;
lay aside all rivalry and jealousy, and, rising&#xD;
above partisan hate and private vengeance, seek&#xD;
to befriend a demsel forlorn, who ,hath fallen&#xD;
into the fowler's snare."&#xD;
&#xD;
Martin Broadbent spoke earnestly and more&#xD;
rapidly than usual. Lovelace thought of the&#xD;
testimony of Hillhouse, and his vague conjec-&#xD;
tures began to take form.&#xD;
"Thou knowest thy business, colonel, and I&#xD;
know mine. Thou art a chief captain over men,&#xD;
and I the humble ruler over negroes. Thou&#xD;
art a discipliner of heroes"-Martin's long,&#xD;
white fingers made a thrust toward the Beaufort&#xD;
Guard-" and I the subjugator of chattels. For&#xD;
King Cotton thou swingest the sword ; for King&#xD;
Cotton I swing the whip. We serve the same&#xD;
mighty Moloch. Great is Dia'na of the Ephe-&#xD;
sians !"&#xD;
The two men faced each other., The axes of&#xD;
their eyes met. Martin was firm and steady.&#xD;
The officer 'was held in silence and doubt. He&#xD;
recoiled, putting forth his hands, as if to push&#xD;
Martin back. Martin raised his arms, till they&#xD;
seemed to tremble over all the cotton in the&#xD;
South, and said, in a suppressed voice :&#xD;
" Cotton, all hail ! Thou art indeed a king,&#xD;
clothed in purple and finelinen. Thou goest&#xD;
forth conquering and to conquer. Thou leadest&#xD;
men captive. Thy chariot-wheels crush old&#xD;
and young, and the blood flows even to the&#xD;
bridle-rein ! Hail, all hail!" &#xD;
Lovelace gasped, like a drowning man. He&#xD;
brushed his hand across his brow, and seemed&#xD;
terrified. His gaze wandered over the broad&#xD;
cotton-fields. A vision of fire and blood swam&#xD;
before his sight.&#xD;
" What are we," resumed Martin, solemnly,&#xD;
" that we should fear to die for the king? Let&#xD;
us cast ourselves under his groaning chariot-&#xD;
wheels. Let us perish with our wives and sweet.&#xD;
hearts ; with our mothers, fathers, and broth-&#xD;
ers. Men die but once. How glorious to fall&#xD;
for the purple monarch ! Like the Moslem&#xD;
leader, we may proclaim, "Paradise to those&#xD;
that fall !"&#xD;
Lovelace did not speak; lie could not. He&#xD;
was overborne by Martin. He saw armies, and&#xD;
bayonets, and banners, artillery and bursting&#xD;
shells, red shields and trampled fields.&#xD;
"There will be a sound of mourning in the&#xD;
land," continued Martin, in a tremulous tone.&#xD;
" Mothers weeping for their first-born, and wives&#xD;
wailing wildly over slaughtered husbands. But&#xD;
what of this? Cotton is king, and England and&#xD;
France, and all the nations of the earth, kneel&#xD;
at his bloody shrine. Go on ! go on ! Count&#xD;
not the cost. God will smile at the earnage,&#xD;
and applauding angels clap their hands. Bid&#xD;
the birds of the air to the feast ! Long live the&#xD;
sovereign that has but one institution, and one&#xD;
rallying-cry to battle !"&#xD;
He paused a moment.&#xD;
" Thou to thy work-I to mine. Shake out&#xD;
the stars and bars! Down with the Union and&#xD;
the Constitution !"&#xD;
Lovelnee turned away from Martin in wonder&#xD;
mnd dismay. Never had sach pictures been-&#xD;
&#xD;
'1&#xD;
&#xD;
painted on his imagination. When he looked&#xD;
np to make an angry retort, the place where&#xD;
Martin had stood was vacant.      .  .&#xD;
CHAPTER XXL&#xD;
PETER RST.&#xD;
We left Milrose in a situation painful and&#xD;
embarrassing, from  which every fminine in-&#xD;
itinet of her nature shrank with terror and&#xD;
loathing. She saw no means of escape., She&#xD;
resisted at every step ; but, opposed to his&#xD;
rough strength, her feeble hands wer9 unavail-&#xD;
ing. Perceiving that she was wasting her pow-&#xD;
ers fruitlessly, she made a resolute endeavor to&#xD;
regain that self-possession so needful in moments&#xD;
of danger.&#xD;
Having a vigorous intellect, a commanding&#xD;
will, and a quick wit, she would, no doubt, have&#xD;
succeeded in overcoming her excessive fright,&#xD;
and subduing that weakness that injured instead&#xD;
of aiding her, when the timely appearance of&#xD;
Peter lust put an entirely new aspect upon the&#xD;
whole matter. Peter of the Pines came sud-&#xD;
denly from among the. trees, and advancing si-&#xD;
lently and swiftly upon Ben Dykes, tripped. up&#xD;
his heels and laid him upon the ground. The&#xD;
two dogs made a feeble assault upon Peter's&#xD;
legs, but a few well-directed kicks sent them&#xD;
yelping away.&#xD;
Dykes remained where he had fallen, quite&#xD;
breathless and amazed, with his feet entangled&#xD;
in a cluster of laurel.&#xD;
" Look out there, -youngster I" said Peter,&#xD;
warningly, to Milrose. " Don't step into his&#xD;
mouth ! Better get your foot into a bear-trap,&#xD;
than into them there jaws."&#xD;
Milrose ,was unable to speak ; she was in a&#xD;
flutter of joyful emotion.&#xD;
"Don't be afeard," said Peter. "The dan-&#xD;
ger's all over. This critter, you see, isn't in a&#xD;
condition to hurt ye."&#xD;
While Peter was speaking, he gave Ben some&#xD;
sharp strokes with his foot, and added, after-&#xD;
ward :&#xD;
" Get up, you dog-trainer of the ,turpentine'&#xD;
woods, and take yourself off in double-quick'!&#xD;
We'll have a settlement of our accounts one o'&#xD;
these days, I guess."&#xD;
Dykes extridated his feet, arose, and flew at&#xD;
Peter, who parried his wrathful blows and trip-&#xD;
ped up his heels again.&#xD;
Just then Milrose discovered Swampsey, a&#xD;
little beyond Peter, cutting capers with wonder-&#xD;
ful rapidity.&#xD;
As for Angeline, her courage came back in a&#xD;
nost remarkable manner.&#xD;
"1 Laws, Miss Lilly !" she exclaimed, forget-&#xD;
ting her role. "Tole ye 'twa'n't nothin'. What's&#xD;
the use being' scared at a low white trash like&#xD;
Turpentine Ben ?" .&#xD;
Milrose gave her maid an admonitory shake,&#xD;
to bring her back to prudence.&#xD;
&#xD;
3eu Dykes got up and sneaked away, mutter-&#xD;
ing threats and curses.&#xD;
Day was now dawning. Faint rays of light&#xD;
fell on the pale face of Milrose. Peter of the&#xD;
Pines contemplated her with manifest embar-&#xD;
rassment.&#xD;
- " You need not ,tremble," he paid, encourag-&#xD;
ingly. " I know enough of you to understand&#xD;
how you should be, treated. Don't look down&#xD;
and blush. I like spirit and bravery. Folks is&#xD;
sometimes forced to do what they'd rather not.&#xD;
But the best way is, to draw a cheerful face and&#xD;
make the best ont. I remember ye well. How&#xD;
could I forget that face? I couldn't - never,&#xD;
never ! It come to me up there"-he pointed&#xD;
toward the plantation-" like an angel's. I own&#xD;
I never 'saw nothin' like.it, and for a moment or&#xD;
so, I allowed you was supernat'ral."&#xD;
" Love o' God !" cried .Angeline. "'Pears&#xD;

" Never mind your secret," replied Peter,&#xD;
"butcome with me. What I can do for you,&#xD;
I'll do with hearty good-will, and with no more&#xD;
cur'osity than is nat'ral to human natur'."&#xD;
" I thank you for your kindness," said Mil-&#xD;
rose, recovering her confused faculties. " I am&#xD;
sure you are very considerate. But do not mis-&#xD;
take my feelings: I do not regret the step I&#xD;
have taken, nor do I blush at these garments.&#xD;
I am young, but not a child, sir. I have no in-&#xD;
clination to-play the fainting heroine. My story&#xD;
is brief. I was in danger under the roof where&#xD;
I should have been entirely safe. I determined&#xD;
not to remain there longer. I made my escape;&#xD;
therefore, by a combination of circumstances&#xD;
not foreseen, I am here, and in this attire.&#xD;
Abashed I may be ; disappointed I certainly&#xD;
am ; but return I will not ! Do you understand&#xD;
me, Peter Rust ?"&#xD;
Milrose spoke in a firm yet sweet tone of&#xD;
voice, and her consistency and courage had a&#xD;
favorable effect on Peter.&#xD;
" I was born and brought up, miss, in a coun-&#xD;

Peter, who had all the while held his double-&#xD;
gun in his hand, laid it carefully in the bend of&#xD;
his left arm, studiously keeping its muzzle&#xD;
pointed from Milrose.&#xD;
"I can .say, miss, that I think I know your&#xD;

MILROSE ; OR, THE COTTON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
THE PLANTER AND THE OVERSEER.&#xD;
The scene with Ela, in the slave-hut, made a&#xD;
deep impression on Martin Broadbent's mind.&#xD;
Like a faithful guardianir, lie kept watch near the&#xD;
hut till morning. His anger was equal to his&#xD;
vigilance. It was a steady and unquenchable&#xD;
flame that burned within him. There were&#xD;
many dangers to be averted from her head. To&#xD;
save her from the malice and baseness of Low-&#xD;
enthal, was his fixed purpose. He feared that&#xD;
he might visit her secretly, and discover the de-&#xD;
ception that had been practiced ; in which event,&#xD;
it was difficult to foresee what might happen.&#xD;
Martin was a man of resolution. His courage&#xD;
was of a calm and elevated .kind. In a just&#xD;
cause, he was full of noble daring. In the&#xD;
presence of Ela, he had thrown off the repul-&#xD;
sive character which he had assumed. He had&#xD;
stood before her as he really was-a :revelation,&#xD;
most surprising and agreeable. Her feelings it&#xD;
is not possible to describe ; they were of a&#xD;
mingled and tumultuous nature. There was first&#xD;
a dizzy whirl of wonder ; afterward, a staggering&#xD;
incredulity ; then, an electric glow of convic-&#xD;
tion; and finally, a full and joyful conscious-&#xD;
ness of protection.  In her. esteem, Martin&#xD;
Broadbent grew to fair and heroic proportions.&#xD;
Be came to her, as an angel in a place where&#xD;
there was no light. His quiet face was continu-&#xD;
ally in her sight, strengthening her through the&#xD;
long nights.&#xD;
When, after some hours of restlessness, she&#xD;
fell asleep, she dreamed of Martin, and beheld&#xD;
him towering like a giant between herself and&#xD;
Lowenthal. While her mind thus instinctively&#xD;
clung to her preserver, he was keeping silent&#xD;
vigil over the but that sheltered'her.&#xD;
In the morning, when other duties called him&#xD;
away, he placed a trusty negro in charge.&#xD;
After his interview with -Colonel Lovelace, he&#xD;
was slowly returning to the negro-quarters, when&#xD;
he met his employer. Lowenthal was excited.&#xD;
The full'effects of the disappearance of Milrose&#xD;
were upois him. He was amazed and alarmed.&#xD;
With these two emotions, there were alternations&#xD;
of anger. This meeting with Martin seemed to&#xD;
him opportune. He wanted somebody to venti-&#xD;
late his wrath upon.I&#xD;
"This plantation, sir, is rather loosely con-&#xD;
ducted, sir! My daughter has run away, sir !"&#xD;
he exclaimed, in a loud and fault-finding voice.&#xD;
" I am not thy daughter's keeper, friend Low-&#xD;
enthal," answered Martin, wildly. My duties&#xD;
are limited to the negro race. It is not mine to&#xD;
control men and women but to govern chattels !"&#xD;
" But you should have your eyes about you,&#xD;
sir !" retorted the planter. "You ought to see&#xD;
what is going on around you, Mr. Broadbent."&#xD;
" I tell thee, friend Planter, I have nothing to&#xD;
do with thy daughter. The services that I give&#xD;
thee for a stipulated sum, touch not thy house-&#xD;
hold. If thou thinkest I would undertake to&#xD;
&#xD;
control a woman, young or old, tlhou art greatly&#xD;
mistaken. I know the sex are rebellious ; and&#xD;
the younger and comelier, the more rebellious.&#xD;
Heaven defend me from the care of damsels !&#xD;
I can use the schoolmaster-which is the whip&#xD;
-with some small skill and success. I can flag-&#xD;
ellete, castigate, macerate, score, and under-&#xD;
score, with acceptation and profit; but when it&#xD;
comes to the nicer manipulations and manage-&#xD;
ment of woman-kind, I confess my inability and&#xD;
weakness."&#xD;
Broadbent rolled up his eyes, and sighed.&#xD;
" Bah !" said Lowenthal, contemptuously&#xD;
" Didst thou ' Bah' to me, friend Lowenthal?&#xD;
I'd rather thee wouldn't ' Bali' to me. I am&#xD;
not a goat, that thou shouldst 'Bah' to me&#xD;
after the manner of such I"&#xD;
"Not a goat, but a donkey !" sneered tire&#xD;
planter.&#xD;
"The animal thou likenest me to, is- a most&#xD;
useful, though not comely beast ; and like the&#xD;
black chattel, worketh well when subjected to&#xD;
man. Yet I would prefer to be likened to the&#xD;
noble horse that combineth utility with beauty&#xD;
and strength. And that remindeth me that it&#xD;
seemeth a great mistake of Nature that the&#xD;
Black Saxon was not made to go upon all fours,&#xD;
like his co-worker, the ox."&#xD;
Martin looked serious and reflective. His&#xD;
employer stared at him.&#xD;
"I can class the world under two heads," he&#xD;
said, keeping his eyes on the Quaker. " Take&#xD;
a sheet of paper and draw a line through the&#xD;
centre of it. At the top, on the left of the line,&#xD;
write fools ; on the right, write knaves ; and&#xD;
under these two headings you and I and every--&#xD;
body else may find our places."&#xD;
" Nay, there are some foolish knaves and&#xD;
some knavish fools," answered Martin, with im-&#xD;
perturbable phlegm.&#xD;
"That is but a variation on the same two&#xD;
strings. You may ring the changes on them,&#xD;
cut them into half-notes, quarter-notes,' or&#xD;
eighths, flatten or sharpen them to your taste,&#xD;
and they will still be the same. Pure folly and&#xD;
pure knavery may not often be met with, but&#xD;
we can afford to give the name to the prepon-&#xD;
derating article. I have not classified you, yet,&#xD;
Broadbent, and I'm sometimes afraid that you'll&#xD;
go far to upset my system; but I'm after you,&#xD;
like Agassiz after a fish ; and if we don't dis-&#xD;
agree, we shall be good friends. Bht I'm watch-&#xD;
ing you, Martin. - Don't get in my way, and&#xD;
you won't be stepped on."&#xD;
.The planter gave Martin a meaning glance.&#xD;
" I should hate to have thee step on me !"&#xD;
observed the latter.&#xD;
" How is the girl Ela ?" asked L6wenthal,&#xD;
abruptly. "I hope you haven't been too hard&#xD;
on her. I didn't mean to submit Ifer entirely&#xD;
to your damned cruelty. I trust she is well&#xD;
enough ?"&#xD;
He walked about uneasily.&#xD;

CHAPTER     XXIV.&#xD;
THE MEETING AT THE, CABIN,&#xD;
Attended by Babel, the planter appeared at&#xD;
Peter Rust's cabin at the appointed time.'&#xD;
Markthaler was there. He -was sitting at a&#xD;
rough pine table, and Jacob stood behind him.&#xD;
The small interior was lighted by a single&#xD;
lamp, which threv a fitful glare onthe pale face&#xD;
and gray beard of the usurer, whose young fea-&#xD;
tures contrasted most strikingly with his flow-&#xD;
ing white hair. There was a certain classic&#xD;
delicacy in the arch cf the brow, the turn of&#xD;
the chin and nose, and the cut of the mouth,&#xD;
that could not escape the attention of even&#xD;
a common observer. There were, at times, a&#xD;
sublimated sneer upon the lips and a haughty&#xD;
quivering of the eyelids, that gave occasional&#xD;
intimations of what was passing within.&#xD;
"I expected," said Lowenthal, evidently dis-&#xD;
appointed, " to meet you alone."&#xD;
The money-lender pointed significantly at&#xD;
Babel.&#xD;
" He's a deaf mute," replied the planter to&#xD;
this silent qeuery.&#xD;
" Jacob is a 'deaf mute, when I wish him to&#xD;
pe. Besides, be is not such a monster as your&#xD;
Babel.. You perceive that. Jacob has regular&#xD;
features and a fair person ; but yours is a very&#xD;

chief. It is well he cannot speak, for one&#xD;
might look for a dreadful voice out of that&#xD;
body. Why didn't you bring the devil with&#xD;
you, without any ceremony?&#xD;
Markthaler drummed on the table with his&#xD;
small, white hand. Babel, 'standing just' be-&#xD;
hind his master, kept his large eyes on Mark-&#xD;
thaler while he was speaking, and there was&#xD;
something approximating to wonder in his ex-&#xD;
pression. A thought, new and suggestive, was&#xD;
working in his mentality.&#xD;
" Stand behind me Jacob," added Markthaler.&#xD;
"Sit there, 'Lowenthal, and put your moon-calf&#xD;
where you like. There! Now what do you&#xD;
want?"&#xD;
~ " Not quite so imperative, good Jew !" an-&#xD;
swered Lowenthal, frowning. "You are not in&#xD;
your money-den at home. However," he said,&#xD;
in a milder tone, "he that holds the purse con-&#xD;
trols the sword. My want is not a new one ;,it&#xD;
is chronic. You know, well enough, what it is.&#xD;
What can you do for me ?"&#xD;
"Nothing !" replied Markthaler with quiet-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
" You will do nothing!" repeated Lowen-&#xD;
thal, contracting his brows.&#xD;
"That is it, sir."&#xD;
The long taper fingers of the money-lehder&#xD;
still drummed lightly on the table. It was an&#xD;
aristocratic hand. The planter wondered why&#xD;
it did not belong to a born gentleman, instead of&#xD;
a usurer.&#xD;
" Concerning those papers ?" he said, and&#xD;
stopped.&#xD;
" Go on."&#xD;
Glancing over the planter's head, Markthaler&#xD;
saw Babel's face working with emotion. The&#xD;
idea that had crept into his dark head seemed&#xD;
to have something startling in it.&#xD;
"Have you brought them ?" asked Lowen-&#xD;
thal.&#xD;
" Jacob has them. Hold them up, Jacob."&#xD;
Jacob held up a bundle of papers.&#xD;
"One of those papers'I must have !" -said&#xD;
Lowenthal, depressing his voice.&#xD;
"Must is for kings and usurers," replied Mark-&#xD;
thaler. 'i The fact is, Lowenthal, coffers have&#xD;
bottoms, and all things have an end. Our busi-&#xD;
ness is about done. I see no way of turning&#xD;
you to any future account. You have no prop-&#xD;
erty. What you had, and what you appeared to&#xD;
have, is tied up in those papers. The negroes&#xD;
don't belong to you, neither does the planta-&#xD;

that you possessed before your second marriage.&#xD;
I have even lent you on some of your step-&#xD;
daughter's diamonds. You represented to me&#xD;
that ,you owned everything ; but Miss Milrose,&#xD;
is the legal owner of the estate and its belong-&#xD;
ings. Now, what do you propose to do ?"&#xD;
The two looked at each other across the&#xD;
table.&#xD;

The black stepped slowly back to his place ;&#xD;
he exchanged a glance with Jacob, and set his,&#xD;
teeth hard together. His large lips were as&#xD;
white as Lowenthal's, and quivered nervously.&#xD;
Jacob watched him a moment, and his yellow&#xD;
fiee kindiled with intelligence. A short silence&#xD;
lowed...&#xD;
Markthaler was grave and thoughtful, look-&#xD;
ing wonderingly, now and then, from the plant-&#xD;
to the mute negro.   He marveled at the&#xD;
@indness of one, and the self-control of the&#xD;

But Martin had already left the- cabin ; and&#xD;

AT REST.&#xD;
Where the pine trees grew thickly, and ran&#xD;
1p straight into the sky ; where the aged moss&#xD;
hung in meshes from the boughs ; where the&#xD;
laurel grew rank and clustering ; where the&#xD;
wiry viies ran like serpents along the ground,&#xD;
toiling around bushes and sturdy trunks; where&#xD;
irds made their nests undisturbed ; where the&#xD;
footsteps of man never trod ; where solitude&#xD;
md silence, reigned ; where the quietude and&#xD;

paused Peter Rust, with his weary charge. -&#xD;
They had walked till the sun was higher than&#xD;

though she's mighty apt to git scared at noth-&#xD;
in'. - phe's afeard o' catanmountains and jacko-&#xD;
lamsons, and sich. But I don't give up to them&#xD;
things, anyways," said Angeline, whose tongue&#xD;
weariness had kept under restraint a long time.&#xD;
" You're one the brave ones !" answered Pe-&#xD;
ter, drily. " I obsarved, when Ben Dykes had&#xD;
hold of your mistress, you  was full o' courage&#xD;
and spirit."&#xD;
" It wasn't Ben Dykes I's scared at," said An-&#xD;
geline, tossing her head, "- but I's afeard he'd&#xD;
burt Miss Mil'."&#xD;
"Lome along, miss," said Peter, kindly,&#xD;
stooping to enter the hut. " Here's a seat for&#xD;
ye that the Queen of England might sit on&#xD;
'thout complainin'."&#xD;
He pointed to a .couch of boughs, covered&#xD;
with the skins of animals.&#xD;
Milrose sank upon this luxurious couch with&#xD;
a feeling of exhaustion she had never before ex-&#xD;
perienc d,&#xD;
" This is a relief!" she sighed. " Are we safe&#xD;
here, Mr. Rust ?"&#xD;
'I think so. Only dogs can find us, least-&#xD;
wise," lie replied, thoughtfully.&#xD;
" Dogs ain't of no 'count," said Angeline,&#xD;
with contempt. "Was brought up 'mong 'em&#xD;
-lived with 'em. Dogs know me well enough."&#xD;
The girl seated herself near her mistress.&#xD;
" Tired most to death, I do believe," she con-&#xD;
tinued. " Do fly round, Peter, and get us&#xD;
something to eat. Don't 'epect we're going' to&#xD;
live on nothin'--do ye ?  But you needn't be&#xD;
particular ; a strong cup o' coffee, a tender ven'-&#xD;
son steak, and some nice bread and butter'lldo&#xD;
well enough. Laws ! we don't care what we eat,&#xD;
anyways."&#xD;
" You'll have to content yourself with some'at&#xD;
less nor that," returned Peter, smiling. " I don't&#xD;
keep a hotel here in the turpentine woods ; but&#xD;
sicht as I can get, you shall have, right willin'."&#xD;
Peter very cheerfully kindled a fire, and while&#xD;
lie was bus" improvising a meal, Milrose and&#xD;
Angeline fell aleep. The still-hunter looked&#xD;
at them compassionately. The benevolence of&#xD;
his nature was fully awakened. Milrose, so&#xD;
young and fair, filled him with a soft and tender&#xD;
admiration. She was more like a creation of&#xD;
his ideality than a real flesh-and-blood maiden.&#xD;
Peter Rust hind dreamed of such a being in&#xD;
some of his happier slumbers in the forest ;&#xD;
and now that he had accidentally fallen upon&#xD;
the substance of the nocturnal shadow, he was&#xD;
both pleased and surprised. But Peter had no&#xD;
thought - of loving Milrose otherwise than ho'&#xD;
would love a flower or a beautiful picture.&#xD;

MILROSE ; OR, TIlE COTTON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
"#Really and truly, Colonel Lovelace," Mil-J&#xD;
rose answered, with equal seriousness, "I cannot&#xD;
make my lips belie my heart. Destiny has not&#xD;
Written what you Wish. We must follow fate.&#xD;
Bow 'to it' gracefully. Accept my friendship;&#xD;
and if I may not love you, let me ever be able&#xD;
to respect your character, and honor your high&#xD;
and chivalrous nature."&#xD;
She frankly held out her hand. Lovelace&#xD;
took it sadly.&#xD;
"'Lowenthal favored my ambition," he said,&#xD;
in a mournful tone.&#xD;
" You were deceived," answered Milrose, ear-&#xD;
nestly.= "-Had my heart responded to your suit,&#xD;
no one would so bitterly have opposed you as&#xD;
Lowenthal."-&#xD;
"Is this possible ?" exclaimed the colonel.&#xD;
"«You- need not' doubt it. If he played one&#xD;
part with you, with me he acted 'another. He&#xD;
said to me : ' Beware of Lovelace ! His lands&#xD;
and his negroes are swallowed up by creditors.&#xD;
He has nothing but his commission and 'his&#xD;
sword.' There i I have been frank with you.&#xD;
It is-but justice to a man of honor !"&#xD;
The Confederate officer held the little hand an&#xD;
instant in his, then relinquished it, with a sigh.&#xD;
His face was now flushed with resentment. '&#xD;
" Your voice is truth," he replied, much dis-&#xD;
turbed. " You have opened my eyes ;' I begin&#xD;
to see clearly. He who deceives me once, will&#xD;
*    not deceive me again. I have been misled.&#xD;
Look, Milrose !" He pointed to the open door&#xD;
of ,the hut. " The sun' ig going down ; so sink&#xD;
my hopes; but,'like t e-sun, they will not rise&#xD;
again. -The night o my disappointment has&#xD;
come. But I shall not grope, whining'and com-&#xD;
plaining, through the darkness.' I will'bear my&#xD;
life-long regret like a man."&#xD;
" You speak in a manner becoming your dig-&#xD;
mity. ' I trust I shall continue to deserve your&#xD;
good opinion. I left Lowenthal,'because I was&#xD;
not safe there. A sense of danger continually&#xD;
haunted me. That man was the husband of my&#xD;
mother; but in him I feel that I have an enemy&#xD;
of the most malignant character."&#xD;
" For what reason is ie your enemy ?" Love-&#xD;
lace asked. " He is bond by every law of hu-&#xD;
manity-to protect you."&#xD;
" Tell you what, Mars'r Lovelace !" cried An-&#xD;
geline. - "lHe was goin' to shut her up in a&#xD;
construction at the top o' the house. What did'&#xD;
he put Peter Rust up there for, anyways? 'What&#xD;
did they tote up so much lumber, and saws, and&#xD;
hammers, and nails for? Be them kind o' con-&#xD;
traptions wanted in a 'spectable family ?"&#xD;
" All this is inexplicable !" exclaimed the col-&#xD;
onel.&#xD;
"It don't 'pear like myster'ous to me," re-&#xD;
lied Angeline, with decision. " A young lady&#xD;
gat owns two or three 'hundred niggers, and a&#xD;
big plantation, and a fine house, and a good 'eal'&#xD;
o' property, and lots o' di'monds,'and money&#xD;
and things, isn't likely to get through the world&#xD;
&#xD;
I-&#xD;
&#xD;
I without plenty o' trouble, nor without findia'&#xD;
somebody willin' to rob and murder her, and&#xD;
pizen her, and put her to death, and -take her&#xD;
life, and all she owns, arid her niggers and her&#xD;
plantation, money, and di'monds I"&#xD;
Angeline relieved herself of these expressions&#xD;
with high-pressure rapidity, while the Confeder.&#xD;
ate officer listened with increasing wonder.&#xD;
Milrose was terrified by the volubility of her&#xD;
maid. It is a notable fact, that plain people ar&#xD;
apt to speak the plain truth. A porter will tell&#xD;
more truths in an hour than a prince will tell in&#xD;
a day.&#xD;
" My maid," said Milrose, "is in the habit of&#xD;
speaking her mind without consulting my wish-&#xD;
es."     P&#xD;
"In this instance, I am glad that it is so,"&#xD;
answered the colonel ; "for her simple and&#xD;
straight-forwarA declaration has given me a net&#xD;
insight into your life, and the character of your&#xD;
stepfather. I must believe that I have been a&#xD;
dupe, however humiliating the thought. From&#xD;
this moment, Miss Dorn, count me among your&#xD;
friends."&#xD;
He recalled the evidence of Hillhouse, and;&#xD;
although it revived unpleasant associations, it&#xD;
operated powerfully against Lowenthal. Anger&#xD;
and pride served to elevate his feelings. If he&#xD;
could not be an accepted lover, he could at least&#xD;
be a faithful friend, and the protector of Milrose.&#xD;
His line of conduct was quickly decided upon,&#xD;
and reflected credit on his manhood.   He&#xD;
blushed at the recollection of his injustice to&#xD;
Frederick North. Blinded by his unfortunate'&#xD;
passion, and hurried on by a false devotion to&#xD;
the rebel cause, h .had been guilty of an act of&#xD;
oppression which, iad it not been for the singu-&#xD;
lar interference of the usurer, might have gone&#xD;
on to crime. --&#xD;
As he sat there, with bowed head, lie passed&#xD;
through a great crisis of his life: He felt faint&#xD;
and sick; lie trembled, he gasped ; and--and--.&#xD;
he relinquished Milrose.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVIIL&#xD;
FREDERICK NORTH DESERTS.&#xD;
Frederick North did not intend to remain long&#xD;
in the, Confederate service. He accepted the&#xD;
gun and knapsack as the least of two evils. He&#xD;
had no particular objection to being a soldier is&#xD;
a cause receiving the sanction of his conscience;&#xD;
but to bear arms against his country was wholly&#xD;
repugnant to his feelings. The pure flame of&#xD;
patriotism  burned brightly in his heart;, it&#xD;
could not be extinguished by the lawless rule of,&#xD;
the rebellious leaders.  The long-established'&#xD;
order of things might be broken up; civil war&#xD;
might prevail; terrorism might reign ; Union,&#xD;
men might be hunted down like felons, and,&#xD;
persecution appear in its most revolting shapes;&#xD;
but none of these things could shake his alle-&#xD;
-giance to the old flag.&#xD;

&#xD;
discovered the malice of Lowenthal and the&#xD;
jealousy of Lovelace. His personal danger did&#xD;
not cause him so much uneasiness as the -peril&#xD;
that seemed to surround Milrose Dorn. The&#xD;
words she had hurriedly spoken during their&#xD;
short interview on the balcony, had been a fruit-&#xD;
ful source of fear and doubt. His arrest and&#xD;
detention could not have occurred at a time&#xD;
more unlucky for his purposes ; and though he&#xD;
bore his impressment into the rebel ranks with&#xD;
outward calmness, his mind was in a whirl of&#xD;
apprehension and impatience. Inwardly, he&#xD;
abjured the seven-starred rag that floated over&#xD;
him, and held in scorn and contempt the preten-&#xD;
sions of the pseudo Government.&#xD;
Frederick North was sleeping outside the&#xD;
crowded little tent to which he had been assign-&#xD;
ed. It was the second night of his stay at Camp&#xD;
Royal. Wrapped in a dirty gray blanket, .he&#xD;
was dreaming of Milrose, when he was awaken-&#xD;
ed by a gentle pressure upon his arm. Open-&#xD;
'ng his eyes, he beheld a large negro standing&#xD;
ver him. ie looked at this dark apparition&#xD;
ith a momentary fear. The moon was shining&#xD;
an his sooty face and herculean person. Fred-&#xD;
ick saw ugly scars on his face, that, apparent-&#xD;
y, grew ghastly in the moonlight as he looked&#xD;
tthem.. His lips were notably African, while&#xD;
is eyes showed two white rims beaming ; like&#xD;
wo dull stars. On one of his brawny, naked&#xD;
imslte observed curious indented lines, as if&#xD;
ot irons had been driven into his flesh.&#xD;
The black stood motionless until assured that&#xD;
1rederie was fully awake, then made signs for&#xD;
iim to arise. The young man threw off his&#xD;
lanket and arose. Babel touched him on the,&#xD;
reast, then touched himself, and pointed tow-&#xD;
rd the pine barrens.&#xD;
" The sentinels ?" whispered Frederick, mak-&#xD;
ng a gesture to the outer limits of the camp.&#xD;
abel put his finger to his mouth and ears; to&#xD;
ive him a knowledge of his feigned infirmities,&#xD;
ad the next instant drew forth a bowie-knife&#xD;
ot much seller than a broadsword. This&#xD;
formidable weapon he kept ingeniously conceal-&#xD;
d under his garments.&#xD;
Frederick  was perplexed.   He knew   not&#xD;
whether to follow or refuse. Escape was para-&#xD;
ount in his thoughts ; but this might be a&#xD;
rap set by his enemies. He could not quite&#xD;
understand Babel. When he touched his mouth&#xD;
ad ears; lie knew not whetlher lie was warning&#xD;
im to silence, or indicating the inability of&#xD;
In  e organs. There was no time to lose. The&#xD;
stion was to be decided quickly. Ile looked&#xD;
e black over once more. The white light fall-&#xD;
g on his dark arm revealed the tracery of&#xD;
characters. He read the word " BABEL," and&#xD;
emembere I having heard Milrose mention him.&#xD;
ad he been sent, or had he come of his owq&#xD;
ill?&#xD;
These thoughts passed-rapidly through Fred-&#xD;
rick's mind, and when Babel turned to go, he&#xD;
&#xD;
'  .&#xD;
'   Y "&#xD;
's&#xD;
j  i t&#xD;

&#xD;
was ready to follow. Hesoon perceived that&#xD;
he had no inexperienced guide. He evidently&#xD;
knew exactly where to - go. He did not ap-&#xD;
proach the guard in a direct line, busin a cir-&#xD;
cle that swept half way around the camp, and&#xD;
that fell within the line of shadow of an avenue&#xD;
of trees.&#xD;
Frederick's faith in Babel increased at every&#xD;
step ; so did his desire to get elear of the camp.&#xD;
He expected every moment to be challenged&#xD;
by a sentinel ; but nothing of the kind occurred.&#xD;
The giant soon crept-upon one, but he lay stu-&#xD;
pidly drunk upon the ground. Thenegro bent,&#xD;
overhim, unclasped his resistless fingers from&#xD;
his gun, and gave it to Frederick.&#xD;
, They passed on, and were soon beyond the&#xD;
limits of Camp Royal. The black walked faster&#xD;
-and faster ; he strode toward the long margin&#xD;
of forest with great rides. North spoke to&#xD;
him several times,, by way of experiment, but&#xD;
received no notice.&#xD;
He saw Lowenthal's mansion lying pale un-&#xD;
der the moonlight. While looking at it,. ie&#xD;
could think only of Milrose. Her presence had&#xD;
hallowed it. Her idea gave .a silent charm to&#xD;
the dwelling and all connected with it. He&#xD;
thought of Milrose as still there, exposed to that&#xD;
unknown danger of which she had vaguely spok-&#xD;
en. He stopped, without knowing it, aid con-&#xD;
tinued gazing. Babel's hand upon his shoulder,&#xD;
drawing him onward, aroused him from his rev-&#xD;
erie of Milrose. Presently, ie found himself&#xD;
standing before Peter, Rust's hut. A few days&#xD;
before,-he had flattered-himself that he should&#xD;
meet Milrose there ; but now that pleasing&#xD;
hope seemed fir distant ; perhaps it had be"&#xD;
come impossible. He, sighed gloomily, and&#xD;
looked around for Babel ; he was gone. le&#xD;
stood lone before the cabin of the still-hunter.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
T HE LITTLE GUIDE.&#xD;
While Frederick was wondering at the disap-&#xD;
pearance of Babel, lie saw an object coming&#xD;
toward him. He thought it was an animal ; but&#xD;
presently it proved to be a black boy of very&#xD;
small size, who approached him in a novel way,&#xD;
tumbling heels over head, and revolving like&#xD;
an animated wheel. He struck finally at Fred-&#xD;
erick's feet, like an India-rubber ball ; the next&#xD;
instant, his yard of length stood upright, and as&#xD;
quietly and soberly as if he had always *talked&#xD;
the earth like other mortals.&#xD;
Although taken by surprise by this unexpect-&#xD;
ed appearance, the young man now recognized&#xD;
the little creature as a faithful follower of-Peter&#xD;
Rust.&#xD;
"Well, Swampsey, whatdo you want ?" asked&#xD;
Frederick.&#xD;
Little Dismal winked and blinked as fast as&#xD;
lie could, but did not open his mouth.&#xD;
"is Peter in the cabin ?" continued Frederick.&#xD;
Swampsey shook his head solemnly. Every-&#xD;

MILROSE ; OR, THE COTTON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
thing relating toPeer was, to his apprehension,I&#xD;
a matter of the first consequence.&#xD;
"Mars'r Peter's.gone," he replied.&#xD;
"Gone where ?"     -&#xD;
"4Come 'long Swvampsey," said the boy.&#xD;
"Mars'r. Peter Leff dat yer." He -nodded his&#xD;
head at the cabin. " Mars'r Peter can't stay in&#xD;
.dat , yer. White folks want Mars'r Peter.&#xD;
Mars't Peter got away from white folks. Keep&#xD;
el'ar on 'em, now."&#xD;
The swamp-foundling kept his blinking eyes&#xD;
steadily on Frederick, and his little face grew&#xD;
marvelously serious.&#xD;
"Has Peter been in trouble ?"&#xD;
" Shut him up, down you. Couldn't git out&#xD;
-Mars'r Peter couldn't. Got a rope for him,&#xD;
and he slid down from  dat yer bad place.&#xD;
Spect dey won't cotch him ag'in. - Dat's all&#xD;
'bout dis yer: Come 'long !"&#xD;
Swampsey gave Frederick but little time to&#xD;
deliberate, 'but started off promptly, and with a&#xD;
celer'lty of movement that. the young man did&#xD;
not care to imitate. There evidently being de-&#xD;
sign in this, he followed his unique guide, con-&#xD;
fident that he would not lead him into danger.&#xD;
Sometimes, Swampsey was so far in advance&#xD;
that he could with difficulty see him ; and in&#xD;
several instances, when he thought he- had en-&#xD;
tirely lost him, he came upon him unexpected-&#xD;
ly, passing the time of waiting in turning sow-&#xD;
ersets and walking on his hands. On one of&#xD;
these oce isiois, he was considerably startled to&#xD;
find the boy confronted by a thriftless-looking&#xD;
man, with two dogs, at his heels, and who was&#xD;
threatening him in a boisterous manner. His&#xD;
elocution went after this fashion.&#xD;
"You're Peter Rust's little nig - be ye?&#xD;
You's dug out o' the:mud-wasn't ye ? Wall,&#xD;
now, I reckon you're a fine speciment of a ape.&#xD;
Can't mind yer own business, I s'pose-,can ye ?&#xD;
Have to meddle with mine, promably ! Had to&#xD;
come up to my shanty to tote off my little&#xD;
drummer and trumpeter., That war not your&#xD;
work, though ; you's put up to't by that am-&#xD;
berlition no-'count, Peter Rust ! He sent ye&#xD;
up you, though the Lord he on'y knows how&#xD;
ye had wit 'nough to git thai, and remember&#xD;
what was said to ye. I made up my mind, then&#xD;
that I'd jest make' a el'ar eend of ye ; and I'm&#xD;
now on the p'int o' doin' it. These yer dogs, I&#xD;
reckon, '11- pull ye to pieces quicker nor they&#xD;
would a possum."                 .&#xD;
The fellow  stopped, made great' eyes at&#xD;
Swampsey, and whistled to his dogs.&#xD;
" Mars'r Peter tripped up yer heels !" answer-&#xD;
ed thelad, winking and bliking rapidly. "You&#xD;
ari't do noflin with Mars'r Peter !"&#xD;
" Here, Jeff! Here-here-here !" cried Ben&#xD;
Dykes. " At him, pup! Take him, Beau I"&#xD;
Bat Beau crouched on the ground, and Jeff&#xD;
alone mustered courage to\ assault Swampsey.&#xD;
He sprang -at the lad's throat, but Swampsey&#xD;
flung himself into the air, and alighted behind&#xD;
&#xD;
the hound, which rushed on madly against s&#xD;
tree. Turning to renew the'attack, he met with&#xD;
no better success ; for Swampsy came don&#xD;
on his back, and putting his black arms round&#xD;
Jeff's neck, choked him till both eyes and&#xD;
tongue protruded, and he bowled with pain ani&#xD;
suffocation. Stung by pain, the hound did it&#xD;
utmost to rid itself of its persecutor, and a bur&#xD;
ry-scurry struggle ensued. Sometimes the dog&#xD;
was uppermost, sometimes the boy, and then&#xD;
was a violent scattering of leaves.&#xD;
" Have done there !" vociferated Ben, alainm&#xD;
ed for the safety of his bound. " Come off that&#xD;
yer pup!   Wouldn't kill a innocent dog, wouk&#xD;
ye ?"&#xD;
But Swampsey had no sympathy for an inno&#xD;
cent pup, and kept steadily at his business.&#xD;
" Goddlemity 1" muttered Ben-; "what a spry&#xD;
critter he in ! Should think he's made of eel&#xD;
and wild-cats. Git out there, or l'llc ut you&#xD;
weasand !"&#xD;
Ben drew his bowie-knife from his trowser'&#xD;
leg, where he always carried it, with the poin&#xD;
sheathed in his boot. It was a novel applica&#xD;
tion of a common adjunct of low Southern se&#xD;
ciety ; but Benjsinin Dykes found it exceedia&#xD;
ly convenient and within reach, and when draw&#xD;
out in-a swaggering manner, that piece of ste&#xD;
had an excellent moral effect on the beholden&#xD;
and on various occasions had 'done ore t&#xD;
abash his adversaries than itS actual us&#xD;
Cutting the air with this ugly instrument&#xD;
making a disagreeable, whizzing sound, the doi&#xD;
trainer advanced upon the combatants, inten&#xD;
ing to make a thrust, at the critical moment&#xD;
when there was no dog between Swa'mpsey as&#xD;
the ground-.&#xD;
" Goddlemity !" exclaimed Ben, lugubriously&#xD;
" I'm afeard some'at '11 happen to Jeff. Hoi&#xD;
they do flop over and over ! Beau, you sneak&#xD;
in' pup, why don't you go in and win? It'&#xD;
nothin' but a no 'count nigger, anyway. I']&#xD;
browse you, my lad, for this ! Let go, nig !,le&#xD;
go, dog !"&#xD;
Dykes poised his knife over the floundering&#xD;
pair, but there was no time that it could de&#xD;
send without endangering the canine, and the&#xD;
tender-hearted owner perspired with concern.&#xD;
At this juncture Frederick- North, who hal&#xD;
been a silent observer of most of this scene, ni&#xD;
longer able to repress his indignation, advance&#xD;
suddenly upon Ben, and with the barrel of hii&#xD;
gun gave him such a sharp rap across the knuck&#xD;
les, that he dropped his knife and daneed ab -&#xD;
like a 'trained bear in a menagerie. He wo&#xD;
also have tickled his ribs with his bayonet, ha&#xD;
he not quickly taken himself away. Havial&#xD;
y erformed this meritorious action, he reached&#xD;
down, seized the hound by the hlape of the neck&#xD;
tore him from Swampsey's grasp and flung hisn&#xD;
at his master with such force that, striking hid&#xD;
across the stomach, he drove the breath front&#xD;
his lungs and knocked him flat upon his back.&#xD;

tortion and the extortioner, and his grief is not&#xD;
for the lost fortune, but for her who loses it."&#xD;
"You abuse your master's goodness, Jacob,"&#xD;
said Markthaler, softened somewhat.'&#xD;
" It is his goodness that makes me speak&#xD;
plainly," answered Jacob, with humility.&#xD;
This scene bewildered Frederick. He stared&#xD;
first at one, then at the other. Inexplicably&#xD;
enough, the 'money-lender was obtaining an as-&#xD;
cendency over him.,&#xD;
They walked on slowly, each thoughtful, and&#xD;
Frederick in a maze of doubt.&#xD;
" And so you love her, young man ?" said&#xD;
Markthaler, by-and,-by, turning upon North,&#xD;
suddenly.&#xD;
" Had one asked me that question, entitled to&#xD;
a calm and truthful reply, I should have answer-&#xD;
ed with the frankness of a boy,' 'with all my&#xD;
heart l' Nor would that have expressed the&#xD;
depth and intensity of my 'devotion. She has&#xD;
become a part of my existence. If my soul has&#xD;
an aspiration, it is for Milrose ; if it hasa voice,&#xD;
it continually speaks her name : my, thoughts,&#xD;
my dreams, are of her. But yqu, sir, know&#xD;
nothing of a passion like this. If you have a&#xD;
love, it is the love of' gold ; if you worship,&#xD;
aught, you bow the knee and the spirit to bonds,&#xD;
deeds, securities, and bursting coffers."&#xD;
Frederick made a gesture of infinite contempt&#xD;
toward the usurer.&#xD;
"How well lie reads us, Jacob !" cried the&#xD;
money-lender, with a singular blending of mirth&#xD;
and bitterness.&#xD;
" Think of your hoards, and trouble me no&#xD;
more," added Frederick, moodily.&#xD;
" Think of whom you will, and come along !"&#xD;
retorted Markthaler. And the parties walked&#xD;
on silently.&#xD;
CHAPTER     XXXI.&#xD;
AN AWKWARD PREDICAMENT.&#xD;
It was nearly morning when Peter reaebed&#xD;
the hut. The darkness that precedes the dawn&#xD;
lay heavily on the pines. Emerging- from the&#xD;
thick inclosure of trees, Frederick entered the&#xD;
little opening in which the still-hunter had&#xD;
built hms humble habitation. The first thing&#xD;
that met his sight was a cheerful fire blazing&#xD;
ruddily a few yards from the door of the hut.&#xD;
The next object that drew his attention, was a&#xD;
figure wrapt in a military coat, reclining upon&#xD;
some pine foliage near the burning fagots.&#xD;
Upon this recumbent form young North fasten-&#xD;
ed his eyes with great interest. There was&#xD;
something in the quiet outlines of the unknown&#xD;
person that seemed not unfamiliar to him. This&#xD;
silent guardian was either sleeping, or mentally&#xD;
lost in reverie ; for he did not change his atti-&#xD;
tude until Peter Rust was close upon him. He&#xD;
started up, however, in alarm, before Peter was&#xD;
near enough to touch him. Retreating in a be-&#xD;
wildered manner, he drew a pistol from his&#xD;
breast-pocket, exclaiming&#xD;
&#xD;
" Who comes! Who comes!"&#xD;
" Put up your little joker, colonel," answered&#xD;
Peter, " for there's no danger. Must have been&#xD;
sleeping pooty sound not to have heerd us com-&#xD;
In'.', ,&#xD;
" I have not been sleeping," said Lovelace, in&#xD;
a hollow voice, his abstracted air still clinging&#xD;
to him.&#xD;
The man's tones made Frederick's heart leap&#xD;
under his Confederate jacket. Lovelace, his&#xD;
judge, and his rival, stood before him.&#xD;
Frederick still wore the rebel jean. His knap-&#xD;
sack he had left at camp, bnt'his cartridge-box,&#xD;
containing several rounds of powder and ball,&#xD;
he had brought away ; while upon his shoulder&#xD;
he carried the musket which Babel had taken&#xD;
from the'sleeping sentinel.&#xD;
There he was face to face with the colonel of&#xD;
the Beaufort Guard-a deserter discovered in&#xD;
the very act of flight. But the circumstances&#xD;
were such that he had no qualms of conscience&#xD;
respecting the desertion, and yet the rencontre&#xD;
was, for various reasons, unpleasant. Peter of&#xD;
the Pines lie could rely upon in any emergency,&#xD;
but of Markthaler and the yellow Jacob he was&#xD;
not so certain. As North's surprise abated, a&#xD;
feeling 'of proud resentment took its place. He&#xD;
recalled the recent arrogance of the man, at a&#xD;
time when he- had him wholly at his mercy ;&#xD;
nor did he forget that to Lovelace he wasin-&#xD;
debted for his unjust and proscriptive degradi-&#xD;
dation to the rebel ranks.. The idea of Milrose&#xD;
went sweeping through his'iiiagination, coloring&#xD;
and intensifying his feelings.,&#xD;
The two men stared at each other. To Love-&#xD;
lace it was a moment of bitterness. The sight&#xD;
of Frederick made him terrribly sensible of&#xD;
his own disappointment. To that overpowering&#xD;
grief which the final rejection of Milrose had&#xD;
occasioned, was now added a darker and more,&#xD;
dangerous sentiment. He struggled hard to re-&#xD;
press the sterner and fiercer part of his nature,&#xD;
and to practice that magnanimity which he had&#xD;
)'esolved upon while' in the presence of MissI&#xD;
Dorn. Seeing the young man before him, whom&#xD;
lie was conscious lie had dealt harshly with, all&#xD;
his powers of self-control did not suffice to pre-&#xD;
vent a slight reddening of his cheeks ; it was&#xD;
manhood's instinctive tribute to honor.&#xD;
But something must be said ; a fact of which&#xD;
Lovelace was well aware.&#xD;
"How dare you leave your regiment, sir ?"&#xD;
lie demanded, haughtily.&#xD;
Frederick threw his musket contemptuously&#xD;
to the ground. He advanced deliberately upon&#xD;
the colonel, and folding his arms upon his chest,&#xD;
confronted him with a most natural and digni-&#xD;
fied assumption of pride. Within, he glowed&#xD;
like a furnace ; but he tried to be calm.&#xD;
"It is time to drop this mockery, sir," he&#xD;
said, with tolerable composure.  " You may&#xD;
have a regiment, Colonel Lovelace, but I have&#xD;
none. .You are in this rebellion, heart and&#xD;
&#xD;
,&#xD;
&#xD;
soul, but know, sir, that I am for the Union and&#xD;
the old flag ! Talk not to me, sir; of regiments&#xD;
and subordination ; I scorn such contemptible&#xD;
assumptions of authority. ~ Think you I can&#xD;
forget that shallow mockery at Lowenthal's,&#xD;
which you called a trial. You cannot ,make a&#xD;
rebel of -a man by forcing him into a suit of&#xD;
rebel jean, and giving him a musket and a&#xD;
knapsack. Treason must be in the heart, sir !"&#xD;
" Sir! sir !" stammered Lovelace. "You for-&#xD;
get your position ! I order you back, sir !"&#xD;
"Let- this, arrogance cease, sir," answered&#xD;
Frederick, indignantly. "I am your equal by&#xD;
birth and education; and possibly," he  added,&#xD;
with a perceptible sneer ; " I may not be below&#xD;
you in fortune."&#xD;
"Do not insult me I" said the colonel, biting&#xD;
his lips. "I- am not in a mood to be trifled&#xD;
with."&#xD;
He laid his hand upon his sword."&#xD;
" I have no sword," resumed North, "ut&#xD;
should be most happy,.when equally armed, to&#xD;
give you every satisfaction in mny power."&#xD;
"I have pistols," replied Lovelace, whose an-&#xD;
ger was getting the better of his discretion ;&#xD;
'fbut perhaps," he continued with evident con-&#xD;
tempt for his adversary, "you have no predi-&#xD;
lections for lead."&#xD;
" Pistols will do," said Frederick eagerly.&#xD;
" Produce them quickly, and away with words."&#xD;
Marktlialer, who had been an earnest listener,&#xD;
approached. and said to the colonel,-in a low&#xD;
voice :&#xD;
"You are forgetting your rank, sir."&#xD;
North heard the words, and they fired his&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
" If lie takes refuge behind his rank, .he is a&#xD;
coward !" he exclaimed.&#xD;
"Love o' God !" interposed another voice,&#xD;
with such emphasis that Frederiek turned invol-&#xD;
untarily to look for the person who had spoken.'&#xD;
Guided by the fire-light, his gaze rested on the&#xD;
figure of a youth of sixteen or seventeen-years&#xD;
of age, wearing, like himself, the Confederate&#xD;
jean. A species of fascination kept .him from&#xD;
withdrawing his eyes from this mal-apropos&#xD;
intruder.&#xD;
"It 'pears like they're going to cut each'&#xD;
other's throats. We can't have no such earr'in's&#xD;
on, here, anyways!  Laws, Peter! why don't&#xD;
you step in and stop that yer 1 So'mebody '11'&#xD;
be swoundin' away, the first thing you dunno !"&#xD;
Frederick's wonder grew to exaggerated di-&#xD;
mensions. Had lie heard that voice before ? A&#xD;
latent consciousness told him he had heard one&#xD;
wondrously like it; but it was associated with&#xD;
one of the other sex ; while here, standing dis-&#xD;
tinctly in his sight, was a dark-skinned, but not&#xD;
uncomely boy. He was trying to make this&#xD;
matter clear to his apprehension, when Peter'&#xD;
Rust advanced briskly, with his double-gun in&#xD;
his hand, and said, with a deprecating sweep 'of&#xD;
his long arm:&#xD;
re&#xD;
&#xD;
77&#xD;
&#xD;
" These here are my premises, gentlemen,&#xD;
and I'll have no wrangling' on 'em, I allow ! Live&#xD;
, folks are worth some'at,, but dead ones ain't&#xD;
scarcely of no account whatsomever. Put up&#xD;
your tools, knen, and settle your differences&#xD;
som'ers else."&#xD;
f   Swampsey went and stood just beside Peter,&#xD;
and winked and blinked in his most solemn&#xD;
fashion. The contrast between the two was no-&#xD;
table ; but none of the parties found leisure to&#xD;
mark the striking. difference between six feet&#xD;
two and three feea othing.&#xD;
There was a lull in the storm. The principals&#xD;
in the altercation scowled and looked away from&#xD;
each other in a-most unamiable manner.&#xD;
- North' was about to address some apulogeti-&#xD;
cal words to Peter of the Pines, when a new&#xD;
claimant to his attention' appeared, in the shape&#xD;
of another youth very similar to the first, al-&#xD;
though more-delieately formed, more regular in&#xD;
features, and of lighter complexion.&#xD;
Lads of fifteen and sixteen, and near that pe-&#xD;
riod of life, have certain characteristics in corn-&#xD;
mon, and few of them attract particular notice&#xD;
when met casually, either in the street or any&#xD;
other place ; but this youth, as he hesitatingly&#xD;
drew near the parties, instantly and unaccounta-&#xD;
bly became an object of interest to North. The&#xD;
blazing brands reflected a strong light upon his&#xD;
face, the delicacy and beauty of which might&#xD;
well excuse a gaze of wonder.- His figure, too,&#xD;
had equal claims for observation, presenting&#xD;
those rounded lines and symmetrical proportions&#xD;
that give grace and harmony to tie human form.&#xD;
Perplexed, without knowing why ; bewildered,&#xD;
without apparent cause ; interested without any&#xD;
reason he could think of, his incidental glance&#xD;
became a gaze, and his gaze a stare.&#xD;
The youth made a beseeching gesture to Peter&#xD;
Rust, displaying, as he did so, a hand childishly&#xD;
small.- Frederick looked downward, and saw a&#xD;
pair of feet to match the hand.&#xD;
The silent adjuration of the boy had an.im&#xD;
mediate effect on Peter.&#xD;
" The young man' seems to have forgot ten the&#xD;
pistols," saidl Lovelace,, derisively, watching the&#xD;
direction of Frederick's eyes.&#xD;
"Quite the contrary!"'retorted the young&#xD;
man, his anger, which had subsided a little,&#xD;
flashing up again.  "I think you will never&#xD;
find an antagonist more willing to meet you&#xD;
than I. Let Mr. Markthaler arrange the pre-&#xD;
liminaries without loss- of time. Any terms&#xD;
that are equal will suit me. Twelve paces, or&#xD;
twenty, or muzzle to breast, are the same to.&#xD;
me."&#xD;
Frederick's de portment was usually distin-&#xD;
guished for its modesty and the absence of every-&#xD;
thing to draw-notice upon himself; but now his&#xD;
air was bold, and his bearing proud and confi.&#xD;
dent. The taunt of Lovelace had stung him,&#xD;
and he was hot to renew the dispute, and end it&#xD;
by an appeal to the deadly duet.&#xD;

moved uneasily, and bit his lips.   -I&#xD;
" A fair retort, Miss Dorn," he replied.&#xD;
" And given without malice, believe me," re-&#xD;
turned Milrose. " Have you not done this young&#xD;

the colonel's eyes fell before her steady look.&#xD;
" I ordered him back to his regiment," said&#xD;
Lovelace. "But I came not to speak of this ;&#xD;
I came to take leave of you."&#xD;
" I can believe, sir, that it is not a subject you&#xD;
like to dwell upon. It is seldom agreeable to&#xD;
recall a wrong we hive done to another. I have&#xD;
heard the details of that mock-trial, conducted&#xD;
by yourself and Lowventhal. Some other feeling&#xD;
than loyalty governed your actions. Sir, I am&#xD;
not a lawyer ; but a simple sense of justice&#xD;
teaches me that your duties had nothing to do&#xD;
with Frederiek North, and that the whole thing&#xD;
was an unwarrantable stretch of power, discred-&#xD;

tegrt will rejoice in his loyality."&#xD;
"Loyal to what ?" asked Lovelace.&#xD;
&#xD;
79&#xD;
&#xD;
" To liberty and the Union."&#xD;
" Then it is as I believed," said Lovelace.&#xD;
"He is a secret enemy of the Confederate Re-&#xD;
public. In making this avowal, Miss Dorn, you&#xD;
place your lover in a dangerous position. Do&#xD;
not forget to whom you are speaking."&#xD;
" I am speaking to a rebel officer, responded&#xD;
Milrose.&#xD;
The colonel's face flushed in a moment.&#xD;
" I would thank you, Milrose,".he returned,&#xD;
curtly, " to bestow on me a name less offensive.&#xD;
We are Revolutionists, not rebels."&#xD;
" A distinction, sir, which the world will' not'&#xD;
make. History will record a different verdict."&#xD;
"I care not," resumed Lovelace, after a pause,&#xD;
" what history calls it. Posterity is for others,&#xD;
and not for me. In loving you, I lose fame,&#xD;

tone to interrupt him..&#xD;

&#xD;

fanned to a flame by the' time I reach camp.&#xD;
Hide him ; hurry him hence; screen hinm from&#xD;
the reflex tide of my jealousy. There ! I have&#xD;
done my duty. If this Frederick North, if this&#xD;
abolition traitor, this secret enemy of the Con-&#xD;
federacy, meet with a tragical fate, remember&#xD;
that you were advised of it beforehand. And&#xD;
now, Milrose, I go. Should we meet again on&#xD;
earth, may it be to be happier, or to find the&#xD;
glowing passions of our hearts burned out and&#xD;
dead. Better to be a clod, than to love in vain.&#xD;
Better be insensible to the softer touches of na-&#xD;
ture, than to feel a passion we cannot ourselves&#xD;
inspire."&#xD;
Bowing low to Milrose, Colonel Lovelace&#xD;
passed from the hut with slow steps and heavy&#xD;
heart, leaving Milrose in a'whirl of unpleasant&#xD;
thoughts. Without speaking a word to any one,&#xD;
the Confederate officer went silently and sor-&#xD;
rowfully from Peter's retreat, and it was soie-&#xD;
time before it was known to the parties without&#xD;
that he had gone.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIIL&#xD;
PETER SPEAKS HIS MIND ABOUT MILROSE.&#xD;
Frederick saw the Confederate officer enter'&#xD;
the hut with 'feelings of jealousy and alarm.'&#xD;
Why did he follow Milrose? What relation did&#xD;
they at that timesustain to each other?' Why&#xD;
was Milrose there?&#xD;
He reflected. A most painful thought crept&#xD;
insidiously into his brain. The girl had per-&#xD;
haps forgotten her sweet assuranes, and-fled&#xD;
with Lovelace in the disguise in which he had&#xD;
found her. He asked himself if that was not a&#xD;
natural inference growing'out of the situation.&#xD;
The probabilities, it struck him, were strong in&#xD;
favor of this' view of the ease. He tortured&#xD;
himself with that possibility.  His dislike of&#xD;
Lovelace increased. His protracted stay inthe&#xD;
hut terrified him ; it.confirmed his worst fears.&#xD;
What right had he there ? Why was notAnge-,&#xD;
line with her mistress? Why did she sit sleep-&#xD;
ily' at the door, while Lovelace was admitted&#xD;
to the very sanctuary of innocence?  He per-&#xD;
suaded himself that there was more in this 'at'&#xD;
taehment of his rival than he had hitherto un-&#xD;
derstood.'&#xD;
He seated himself on the couch of boughs&#xD;
recently occupied by Lovelace, with-feelings of&#xD;
distraction and bewilderment that rendered him&#xD;
miserable.&#xD;
Peter was busy for a time with Markthaler&#xD;
and Jacob. He saw those persons conversing'&#xD;
apart, but engrossed in his own doubts and fears,&#xD;
gave them but little notice.&#xD;
Presently Peter came to him, and observing&#xD;
his depression of spirits, said, in 'a kindly tone':&#xD;
" Cheer ii lad ! Nothin'- is so had as it&#xD;
seems at fi-' Gals is an uncertain thing ; but&#xD;
they are easy managed arter you get the run&#xD;
on 'em."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am afraid," answered North, desponding'&#xD;
ly, "that I have never been so fortunate as&#xD;
to get the run of them    to use your own&#xD;
wor s."&#xD;
" There's some," added Peter, shaking his&#xD;
head in, perfect-conviction of the truth of what&#xD;
he was saying, " that can't be-trusted."&#xD;
Peter glanced mildly at the newly-risen sun,&#xD;
then adde d, with a benevolent expression :&#xD;
" Then'ag'in, there's them that can."&#xD;
" Explain all this," cried Frederick, no lons,&#xD;
ger able to control his suspense. "Why is she&#xD;
here ? Answer me without delay."&#xD;
" Go and ask her," answered Peter. "If you&#xD;
want to know some'at of a woman, go to that&#xD;
wdman and ask her."&#xD;
" I thought you might save me that trouble,"&#xD;
said Frederick, moodily.&#xD;
" But I won't," returned Peter, bluntly.&#xD;
"What she wants ye to know, she'll tell ye ;&#xD;
and what she 'don't want ye to know, that 1&#xD;
know, I sha'n't say nothin' about. I don't be=.&#xD;
tray none sich as her. She's too good and too&#xD;
pretty not to have her own way about every-&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
" I thought she was an, angel not long since,"'&#xD;
said North, cynically.&#xD;
" Well, what do you think ofbher, now ?" ask.&#xD;
ed Peter, gruffly.&#xD;
"Answer that yourself, Peter. I find her in&#xD;
the pine barrens, in male attire, attended by&#xD;
Colonel Lovelace, an old admirer. In their&#xD;
good company there is but -one person, and&#xD;
that person 'a mulatto girl, a slave, and in the&#xD;
same anomalous guise. Think of the time, the,&#xD;
place, the hour-; then put all these together,&#xD;
and speak hopefully to me, if you can."&#xD;
" Be careful what you say, young man," an-&#xD;
swered Peter of the Pines, sharply. "If another&#xD;
had said what you have been sayin', some'at.&#xD;
would have happened to him afore he'd got&#xD;
through with it. I remimber well enough where&#xD;
I first see her ; how onexpected she came , what&#xD;
a sudden wonder came over me ; bow my blood&#xD;
thrilled, and my thoughts went and came doubt-&#xD;
in'ly ;' how-'white she was, and what brightness'&#xD;
beamed from her droopin' eyes! Do you think&#xD;
I shall forget it ? Do you s'pose the image will.&#xD;
ever pass away? No   I see her now, standin'&#xD;
ahind Babel, her long robes sweepin' the floor,&#xD;
her slight form tremblin' on the threshold."&#xD;
The still-hunter pressed his brown right hand-&#xD;
upon his heart, and sighed so softly that the&#xD;
sound was like the murmuring of the pine'&#xD;
leaves. Frederick,'partialIy raised himself, and.&#xD;
looked at Peter Rust wit new interest. 'He-&#xD;
could not yet understand the dweller among the&#xD;
pines. His allusions to Milrose were utterly in.&#xD;
explicable.&#xD;

" Explain." "Go way, you todlepole !" said Angeline,&#xD;

Milrose smiled faintly,.and supported herself&#xD;

The steadfast look of the money-lender ; the&#xD;
severe tone in which he spoke ; the startling&#xD;
import of his words, surprised, and epibarrassed&#xD;
North. It seemed to him that a new piase o(&#xD;
the subject was presented., The'ioneylender&#xD;
had, unquestionably, made..an allusion to lil-&#xD;
rose. What was the meaning pf.this?, By.what,&#xD;
right did he pretend to exert a controlling influ-&#xD;
ence over that yopng .lpdy ?., These thoughts&#xD;
coursed through his mind very rapidly.&#xD;
"Your last remarks," said Frederick,:anon,&#xD;
"lead me to inferences that are not altogether&#xD;
clear."&#xD;
Wacob made significant motions to North over&#xD;
his master's head,               .&#xD;
" I have offered you the road to Milrose and&#xD;
fortune," answered the money-lender,,impress-&#xD;
ively,"' hod you have refused to tale it."&#xD;
" How can I leave her unprotected ?" exclaim-&#xD;
ed Frederick, throwing off the restraint which&#xD;
he had imposed upon his feelings.    1&#xD;
" Trouble yourself not about Miss Dorn,"&#xD;
said Markthaler, frigidly. "She needs not your&#xD;
courage to'defend her from danger. To other&#xD;
hands will be intrusted the care of her person.&#xD;
To-morro y'she will be far frgi here."&#xD;
Jacob continued to gesticulate behind his&#xD;
master, and Frederick was beginning to see that&#xD;
he was dealing with one whose power was great-&#xD;
er than he had previously suspected. But the&#xD;
secret of- this power baffled him. He feared he&#xD;
had already mnide a fatal mistake. He hastened&#xD;
to retrace hisgeps, to regain, if possible, the place&#xD;
he had lost in .the esteem of this strange man.&#xD;
" Be not in haste, sir," he said, considerably dis-&#xD;
concerted. "I have not yet decided to refuse to&#xD;
be the bearer of thpse dispatches you have men-&#xD;
tioned. I will ow.n, sir, that you-have held out&#xD;
a most powerful inducement. I will not pre-&#xD;

Jacob made an approving motion.     -&#xD;
"Do you -hear this infatuated boy, Jacob ?"&#xD;
asked Markthaler, appealing to the mulatto.&#xD;
"Yes, mars'r," he replied.. "He is going to&#xD;
accept."&#xD;
" Do not encourage him, Jacob. Let him&#xD;
choose for himself," responded Markthaler, with&#xD;
severity&#xD;
&#xD;
87&#xD;
&#xD;
" He has decided, mars'r'. He will go. JIe&#xD;
will bear the dispatches with secrecy and coir-&#xD;
age," added'Jacob. with more expressive .pan-&#xD;
tpmirne for Frederick&#xD;
" Jacob is right," said the latter, urged on by&#xD;
his feelings, And phe mute entreaties of the&#xD;

'Th papers y   vedetmo. carry will be aeay&#xD;

" When you receive them, you will have fur-&#xD;

He arose to go.&#xD;
"Is ther9 to more, sir?", sked Frederick,&#xD;
anxiously. ." Did yo. .not, speak of Milrose ?&#xD;
Was I apt ieft to gifer soulewhat from your&#xD;

Markthaler turned upon Frederick suddenly,&#xD;
,and said, with. an carnestygss that .he had not&#xD;
exhibited before during the interview :&#xD;

" What you tell, me seems incredible4!" he&#xD;
stammered, turning, with a strange sense of be-&#xD;
wilderment from  the money-lender. Not re-&#xD;
ceiving any reply, he looked up a moment after,&#xD;
and percei-ed tha4t he was alone.&#xD;

Frederick North returned to the but, meditat-&#xD;

flection brought no light.  The question re-&#xD;
mained unsolved. He did not weary of it, how-&#xD;

curiosity. His singular manners andhis extraor-&#xD;

deed," he added, "you have changed your&#xD;
mind."&#xD;
"My decision was made an hour ago," an&#xD;
swered Frederick, beginning to examine th(&#xD;
papers placed before him, on one of which was&#xD;
drawn elaborate plans of Forts Beauregard and&#xD;
Walker.- Having satisfied himself of the value&#xD;
of these documents, he again expressed his wil-&#xD;
lingness to attempt to carry them to the Fed-&#xD;
eral flag-ship. .These plans and specifications&#xD;
had been made upon the thinnest and lightest of&#xD;
paper, and Peter Rust, taking them in hand,&#xD;
very ingeniously quilted them into the linings&#xD;
of his coat. This consumed considerable time,&#xD;
and the afternoon was well advanced when&#xD;
Frederick was ready to commence his danger-&#xD;
ous journey. He was to set out in no other&#xD;
disguise than 'the Confederate gray;" and, in-&#xD;
deed, it would have been difficult for him to&#xD;
have procured any other in the vicinity of Low-&#xD;
enthal's.&#xD;
" Who will guide me from this wood ?" he&#xD;
asked, when there was no longer anything to&#xD;
detain him.&#xD;
" I have a guide for ye," said Peter. " A&#xD;
guide. asfpis as different from all others, as was&#xD;
ever seen': 4 guide as will go as no other cree-&#xD;
tur can go.,A guide as is not large in size, but&#xD;
full of all Ianner of locomotions' and propul-&#xD;
sions. - A guiqe who loves nothin', and fears&#xD;
nothin'."&#xD;
"here is he ?" inquired Frederick, looking&#xD;
showw him to ye," replied Peter, be-&#xD;
to whistle as if he were calling a dog.&#xD;
'lihdiately Swampsy came somersetting to&#xD;
the spot, in a most reckless and eccentric fash-&#xD;
don.&#xD;
"There he is," resumed Peter, as the lad&#xD;
found a resting-place on the crown of his head,&#xD;
with his two legs and the soles of two black lit-&#xD;
"tle feet pointed like tridents to the skies.&#xD;
" There he is, Mr. North, and it don't make&#xD;
-any odds which way he goes.- Self-adjustin'&#xD;
and self-movin', little Dismal is. Don't have to&#xD;
touch no springs to start him, and when once in&#xD;
motion, there ain't nothin' on airth can'come up&#xD;
to him.&#xD;
Swampsey' filliped over on to his feet, and&#xD;
took on, with marvelous facility, one of his&#xD;
most solemn and impressive countenances, the&#xD;
fellow of which could not be found in the whole&#xD;
of oottondom.&#xD;
" A yard long," pursued Peter. " An insti-&#xD;
tution and a contraband, a chattel and a cattle,&#xD;
as Martin Broadbent would say ; but he can&#xD;
=guide you, not only out of the pine barrens, but&#xD;
to Beaufort itself, and by highways and by-&#xD;
ways and slyways that you've -no idea of."-&#xD;
"This black dwarf guide me to Beaufort !"&#xD;
exclaimed Frederick. "You are jesting, Mr.&#xD;
Rust."&#xD;
" Can you show' him the way to Beaufort,&#xD;
&#xD;
r little Dismal ?" asked Peter, turning to Swamp&#xD;
sey.&#xD;
The foundling winked and }blinked, and wag.&#xD;
gled his head like anfeducated seal.&#xD;
3." You needn't be afeared to trust him," con.&#xD;
I tinued Peter. "He don't talk much, 'but he&#xD;
knows 'a heap o' eunnin' tricks. If he don'&#xD;
keep clear of the prison secesh, it won't be f&#xD;
want of the natur' of the fox."&#xD;
f-'dI have entertained a high opinion of you&#xD;
judgment, Peter, but in this instance I confess&#xD;
I distrust it," replied Frederick.&#xD;
"Poor little gymnastics i" said Peter, re-&#xD;
flectively. " Iobody trusts in him. Nobody&#xD;
believes in him; but he's helped me more'&#xD;
once."&#xD;
Help )Iars'r Peter !" drawled Swampsey,&#xD;
his dar   countenance   becoming  animated,&#xD;
" Help Mars'r Peter "&#xD;
" He was my guide last night," said Freder&#xD;
ick, "and his instincts were sufficiently sharp&#xD;
for the purpose. But _the undertaking before&#xD;
me is a d erent affair, and I fear the lad would&#xD;
encumber rather than aid me. He might be a&#xD;
clog upon my movements, rather than the use-&#xD;
ful creature you are inclined so think him."&#xD;
"He'll be no drag upon ye," responded&#xD;
Peter. "He can take care of himself better nor&#xD;
most people. But I don't just like that rebel&#xD;
jean that you're wearin'. Howsomever, if you&#xD;
can get beyond the reach    of the Beaufort&#xD;
Guards, it'll answer very well ; but if Capin&#xD;
Middlcton gits hold of ye, you'll be shot asn&#xD;
desarter. If you haven't traveled that road&#xD;
much, you won't know which is the safest ; but&#xD;
Swampsey has been there With me at a time&#xD;
when it wouldn't been safe for us to be seen by&#xD;
certain rabid disunionists. If you see hium&#xD;
throw a double Somerset and rund s fast as&#xD;
never hie can, why, take the hint and skedaddle&#xD;
after him. Farewell, Frederick, and come back&#xD;
safe !"&#xD;
The shook hands, but Frederick still linger-&#xD;
ed.It wished to have spartingY word with&#xD;
Milrose. He was going onan errand from&#xD;
which he might never return, and desired to re-&#xD;
new his vows and bid her adieu.&#xD;
SGo," said Ma         '.kthaler; "there is nothing to&#xD;
detain vou. I know why you loiter; but is in&#xD;
vain. You have said to her all that you need&#xD;
say. You have vowed by the moon and the&#xD;
stars ; you have sworn by everything movable&#xD;
and immovable; you have poured ft madora&#xD;
tion by the canto ; you have sighed by the hour,&#xD;
and I see no more for love-sick ingenuity to&#xD;
perform."&#xD;
Although the money-lender tried to speak&#xD;
very gravely, his tones lacked that severity&#xD;
which he wished to enforce.&#xD;
Frederick was about to reply with some eat,&#xD;
when Peter prevented him I'aking the aoug&#xD;
man by the arm, the still-hunter ivalkel  tIl&#xD;
him soe distance on his wanterwa k wit,&#xD;
&#xD;
hiin, in a friendly manner, the virtue of patience,&#xD;
and the value of wholesome self-restraint.&#xD;
'North endeavored, by various expedients, to&#xD;
draw from Peter some definite knowledge of the&#xD;
usurer, but was foiled at every point. Of one&#xD;
thing, however, he felt perfectly assured ; and&#xD;
that was, that Markthaler was ,not what he as-&#xD;
sumed to be. That he exercised, or was about&#xD;
to exercise, an influence over Milrose, he 'as&#xD;
more than ever disposed to believe. Parting&#xD;
from Peter, be followed his little guide through&#xD;
the pines, in a state of dreamy doubt and uncer-&#xD;
tainty concerning the, circumstances that so&#xD;
strangely surrounded him.&#xD;
C      ER XXXVIII.&#xD;
FREDERICK DIS CARDS THE ADVICE OF HIS GUIDE.&#xD;
Frederick pursued his solitary way. The&#xD;
sombre shadows of hight soon enwrapt the for-&#xD;
est like i vast mantle. He could scarcely see&#xD;
the little figure 9f Sivampsey as he ran along&#xD;
before him. He asked no questions, he made&#xD;
no conversation with his pigmy conductor.&#xD;
Thoughts of Milrose, Markthaler, Lowenthal,&#xD;
and Lovelace engrossed him'for a long time.&#xD;
The night grew older; the stars came out, and&#xD;
the moon now and then sailed 'out from among&#xD;
the clouds, and cast upon his pathway soft,&#xD;
white gleams of light, which quivered like elec-&#xD;
tric flashes on the dead pine-leaves. Frederick&#xD;
had at that time little consciousness of his mis-&#xD;
sion. It is true that he intended to discharge&#xD;
his duty with courage and zeal, but there was a&#xD;
sweet dream of Milrose upon him all that night.&#xD;
Every kind word ; every gentle look ; every&#xD;
tender fiash of the eyes ; every beaming smile ;&#xD;
every stray, ringlet fluttering over her white&#xD;
cheek, and all the graces of her person, were re-&#xD;
membered and dwelt upon with all a lover's de-&#xD;
licious infatuation.&#xD;
It is certainly a great pity to drag a lover&#xD;
rudely from-his first Alden, and to obtrude very&#xD;
commonplace things upon his attention in his&#xD;
moments of exaltation ; .but' Frederick was&#xD;
brought out of his enchanted catalepsy by the&#xD;
discharge of a musket, and the warning music&#xD;
of a bullet passing near his person, and striking&#xD;
the branch of a tree beyond him.&#xD;
Swampsey, on hearing this salutation, saltated&#xD;
very high, and came down very low, and looked&#xD;
around very seriously.&#xD;
Frederick drew a pistol which Markthaler&#xD;
had provided him with, and was attempting to&#xD;
discover the source of danger, when Swampsey&#xD;
said:        -&#xD;
" Mars'r Fred," and pointed with his finger.&#xD;
North looked in the direction indicated, and&#xD;
caught glimpses of the Confederate gray mov-&#xD;
ing about among the trees. He comprehended&#xD;
the situation at once. Some of the Beaufort&#xD;
Guard were out searching for him. The conse-&#xD;
quences of capture he well 'knew, and he re-&#xD;
solved not to be taken al e. He was not de-&#xD;
&#xD;
cided which way to go, not' knowing the nums&#xD;
ber of his pursuers, nor at what points they&#xD;
might lie concealed. Little Dismal settled the&#xD;
matter, and if he did not end the doubt, he did&#xD;
the irresolution.&#xD;
" Come 'long, Mars'r Fred,'' said Swampsey,&#xD;
and ran as fast as'he could.&#xD;
North remembered the injunctions of Peter,&#xD;
and followed him. A harm less volley of mus-&#xD;
ketry rattled among the trees just behind them.&#xD;
It was to Frederick a very novel flight, but by&#xD;
no means wanting in the excitement which dan-&#xD;
ger lends to adventure. Swampsey s methods&#xD;
of propulsion were exceedingly varied. Some-&#xD;
times Frederick was confident that the black&#xD;
dwarf was soberly adhering to the earth in the&#xD;
accepted order of nature, and at the next mo-&#xD;
ment was equally certain that he was revolving,&#xD;
end over end, on an equinoctial line drawn just&#xD;
below his stomach. But in whatever fashion lie&#xD;
went, the young man had difficulty in keeping&#xD;
up with him, and at the expiration of ten min-&#xD;
utes, was in a profuse perspiration, and very&#xD;
willing to.halt, if such had been the will of his&#xD;
conductor. They presently emerged from the&#xD;
forest, and were fairly launched on the planta-&#xD;
tions, across which Swampsey led the way with&#xD;
tireless speed. This continued till Frederick&#xD;
was nearly ready to sink down'from exhaustion.&#xD;
He had heard 'pursuit at the outset, but lost&#xD;
sound of it before leaving the woods.&#xD;
Swampse guided him so adroitly,   at they&#xD;
evaded 'te houses of the planters arid 'equar-&#xD;
ters of the negroes. From  a high ridge of&#xD;
ground he could see, when lie stopped, Lowen-'&#xD;
thai's mansion, the roof of which was 'silvered&#xD;
with moonlight. The sight gave him mingled&#xD;
feelings of pleasure and pain. It was there he&#xD;
had seen Milrose ; it was on those silent grounds&#xD;
that his heart had been captivated ; it was in&#xD;
one 'of those pleasant walks that, with pale&#xD;
cheeks and agitated voice, he had dared to woo&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Come 'long, Mars'r Fred," admonished&#xD;
Swampsey.&#xD;
"But where are we going, my lad ?" asked&#xD;
North.&#xD;
" Goin' 'long, Mars'r Fred. Runnin' -'way&#xD;
from the men with guns. Sogers kill Mars r&#xD;
Fred, if they cotch him."&#xD;
" I must go toward Beaufort, at all events,"&#xD;
added Frederick.&#xD;
" Go there with Mars'r Fred," muttered&#xD;
Swampsey.    '&#xD;
"Where is Beaufort ?" inquired Frederick,&#xD;
desirous of testing the knowledge of the lad.&#xD;
" Down you," replied the foundhing, nodding&#xD;
toward the seacoast.&#xD;
As vague as this answer was, he was forced ti&#xD;
be content with it. His guide gave him little&#xD;
time for reflection and choice, but led st right on&#xD;
across fields of cotton, through upland and low-&#xD;
land, through wet and dry, regarding with sub-&#xD;

" Meaning me," said Frederick, calmly.&#xD;
"Meania' you!'" retorted the corporal, em-&#xD;
phatically._&#xD;
North now ceased to regret the lost dispatch-&#xD;
es, for now there was a possibility that they&#xD;
might have fallen into worse hands, or, at least,&#xD;
come into possession of those Wrho would be&#xD;
glad to use them to his disadvantage.&#xD;
He was hurried to the farm-house hoe had so&#xD;
recently left,3iid dragged into it with more en-&#xD;
ergy than hadness. With many threats and&#xD;
much roughness, he ,wAs thrust into a corner,&#xD;
and ordered not to stir, on pain of being sum-&#xD;
marily dealt with. The Confederates then un-&#xD;
strung their knapsacks, and distributing them-&#xD;
selves about th% room, drew forth the rations&#xD;
which they had brought with them, and began&#xD;
to make themselves comfortable. Several sug-&#xD;
gestive flasks appeared, which passed 'rapidly&#xD;
from one to another, and with marked effect;&#xD;
for presently they became boisterously merry,&#xD;
and told wonderful stories of the cowardice of&#xD;
the Federals, and of their own exploits. Fred-&#xD;
-rick was offered nothing in the way of good&#xD;
heer, but more than enough in the wa. of&#xD;
abuse. They called him a great many hard&#xD;
names, and assured him, in every style of dec-&#xD;
lamation, that he was sure to be shot as a de-&#xD;
serter on reaching camp.  All this, as may be&#xD;
believed, did not have a very inspiriting effect&#xD;
upon North, who began to believe, seriously,&#xD;
that his last hour was near. From Lovelace he&#xD;
could expect no favors. The relations which&#xD;
they respectively sustained to Milrose, left him&#xD;
little room for hope.  Lowenthal he had equal&#xD;
reason to dread. Between the two, he doubted&#xD;
not but the fate promised laim by the corporal&#xD;
and his rough crew would be remorsely meted&#xD;
out&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXI-&#xD;
THE FARM-HOUSE.&#xD;
As the soldiers grew hilarious they became&#xD;
uisitive, and in searching -about the house,&#xD;
covered a keg of whisky. Now, for their&#xD;
own good, they had better have found a keg of&#xD;
;unpowder; for gunpowder is easily let alone,&#xD;
tit whisky is not. These gallant fellows made&#xD;
ueh an assault on this dangerous magazine,&#xD;
hat several of them were, in a short time put&#xD;
rs de combat, and were forced to lay down both-&#xD;
heir arms and their legs on the floor. On ac-&#xD;
ount of this mishap,.the corporal, who, to tell&#xD;
&#xD;
the truth, was but little better off, was cormpeil-&#xD;
ed to remain at the farm-house: till his-confeder-&#xD;
abes should be in a condition to shoulder arms&#xD;
and right about face, march. This was one of&#xD;
the casualities of war which could no more be&#xD;
provided against than battles or cannon-balls.&#xD;
Corporal Bently swore an oath or two, then&#xD;
mollified and moistened his wrath by a pro-&#xD;
tracted suction at the keg. After getting his&#xD;
breath, which, for a -few moments, he thought&#xD;
had slipped away into the keg and was lost, lie&#xD;
put two of the soberest men to guard Frederick,&#xD;
then seating himself, with his tack against the&#xD;
door, soon lapsed into a rum sleep, in which he&#xD;
dreamed of Confederate cotton, Confederate ne-&#xD;
groes, and-Confederate scrip. Bull Run and&#xD;
divisions of flying Federals doubtless entered&#xD;
into. the composition of his vagaries, together:&#xD;
with a prophetic view of the greatness and&#xD;
prosperity of the magnanimous South Carolina&#xD;
nation.'&#xD;
The two men set apart, to keep watch and&#xD;
ward upon Frederick North, distrusting their&#xD;
own powers of endurance, and willing to pro-&#xD;
vide for contingencies, proceeded, in spite of&#xD;
remonstranc-s, to tie their prisoner's ankles to-&#xD;
gether with a stout cord, which they found by&#xD;
rummaging about the house. Having by this&#xD;
remarkable foresight met 'the danger in ad-&#xD;
vance, they had more leisure to attend to ' their&#xD;
personal comfort. Some of their comrades,&#xD;
who yet remained sober enough for that duty,&#xD;
went out and examined the poultry-yard ; and&#xD;
finding nothing to reward their trouble, came&#xD;
back in bad temper, and were obliged to have&#xD;
two respective and serious struggles with said&#xD;
keg before their disappointment would soften-;&#xD;
but the most obdurate ill-nature'will yield, after-&#xD;
a time, to the benign influences oz, new corn&#xD;
whisky that is a dead-shot at forty reds.&#xD;

nant to man., He does not feel equal to the task.&#xD;
His ambition soars not so high.     Humbler&#xD;
themes employ his modest pen. He knows&#xD;
that it is a good thing for rebellion; that it is it&#xD;
mild accompaniment of cotton and niggers';&#xD;
that water injures it; that it foams the glorious&#xD;
background of Southern' war ; that it takes&#xD;
kindly to bowic-knives and pistols ; in short,&#xD;
that it renders one Southern gentleman fully&#xD;
equal to five Northern abolitionists. With, this&#xD;
measure of knowledge, the uninspired author&#xD;
subsides upon himself, and resignedly waits for&#xD;
a loftier intellect to lift the laudative chorus to&#xD;
an element so necessary to the existence of rman,&#xD;
yet so destructive to women and children, ne-&#xD;
groes and Indians.&#xD;
It may readily be believed that Frederick ob-&#xD;

MILROSE ; OR, THE COTTON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
ing a state of inebriation, which, in its progres-&#xD;
sive stages,'. was exhilar-ating, jubilant, vain-&#xD;
glorious, boisterous, maudlin, and, finally, inane&#xD;
and stupid.&#xD;
The corporal, awaking after . three hours'&#xD;
sleep, made a great bluster among his fellows,&#xD;
but failed to get them in a suitable condition to&#xD;
start for camp ; so that the remainder of the&#xD;
day and most of the evening were spent in&#xD;
abortive endeavors to rally. These lion-heart-&#xD;
ed creatures had fared so badly in the service&#xD;
of Jeff Davis, that they were glad of a little&#xD;
freedom, and were in no hurry to return to their&#xD;
bondage and corn-bread. Being interested in&#xD;
but one institution in the country, and that re-&#xD;
lating almost exclusively to the distillery busi-&#xD;
ness, they could not be expected to display so&#xD;
much alacrity in the cotton war as those who&#xD;
actually owned thousands of bales of that arti-&#xD;
cle.  Whatever feelings ,actuated them, they&#xD;
elearlyydecided on improving present opportu-&#xD;
nity, and so the whisky debauch went on with-&#xD;
out serious interruption.&#xD;
Frederick was faint and thirsty. One of the&#xD;
Confederates, better-natured than his comrades,&#xD;
held a tin cup full of the contents of the keg to&#xD;
his lips; but his kindness came near being&#xD;
more fatal than his cruelty, for it was of a na-&#xD;
ture so hot and fiery, that the hero of this story&#xD;
liked to have died under it, and barely saved&#xD;
himself from strangulation by aspasmodie with-&#xD;
drawing from the burning chalice. As it was,&#xD;
he became very red in the face, and his throat&#xD;
smarted so badly, that, as favor, he begged&#xD;
the good Samaritan to take the cup away, and&#xD;
give him gunpowder and water, or a mild prep-&#xD;
aration of nitric acid.&#xD;
Frederick was a silent yet vigilant observer&#xD;
of the progress of events. He hoped an op-&#xD;
portunity of escape would occur. He made&#xD;
various attempts to slip the handcuffs from his&#xD;
wrists, but unsuccessfully, He also made repeat-&#xD;
ed endeavors to free his limbs from the cord&#xD;
that kept him helpless, but with no better en-&#xD;
couragement.&#xD;
At night, some fuel was brought in and kin-&#xD;
dled in the wide fire-place. This fire, during the&#xD;
evening, lighted the room, flashing fitfully on&#xD;
the uncouth amusements of the noisy revelers.&#xD;
Having failed, as previously stated, to procure&#xD;
poultry, some of the more adventurous of them&#xD;
went farther, and fared better ; coming back&#xD;
with a corpus of a juvenile swine, which was&#xD;
put to roasting as soon as sufficient beat had&#xD;
been produced. It was the superintendence of&#xD;
the martyrdom of this porker that kept most&#xD;
of them awake after their first stupor, and the&#xD;
dead sleep t hat followed it.&#xD;
Despite the loss of his dispatches, and the&#xD;
fate that menaced him, Frederick finally grew&#xD;
weary with watching and fell into a gentle&#xD;
sleep. He knew not how long this lasted, but&#xD;
probably it was but a brief respite from fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
and anxious (oreboding, for the swine was still&#xD;
sweltering at the fire, and the sleepy ones sat&#xD;
nodding and starting, impatient at the delhe&#xD;
Assisting- in this protracted culinary procves&#xD;
Frederick-beheld with surprise one who, unquve&#xD;
tionably, had entered during his slumber, an,&#xD;
that person was Babel. His surprise was in&#xD;
stant and genuine. The agency of this gigantic&#xD;
black in his escape from Camp Royal, was som'&#xD;
thing he could not forget. He owed him&#xD;
debt of gratitude. He had often thought&#xD;
him since that night when he so unexpected;&#xD;
appeared to guide him through the Confedera&#xD;
guards to Peter Rust's hut. - He recalled th&#xD;
fact that the man had not spoken on that occa&#xD;
sion ; also his inference from the same. W&#xD;
not the coming of this seamed and scarred n&#xD;
gro a favorable omen? He was inclined to r&#xD;
gard it as such.&#xD;
He.watched Babel with awakened expec&#xD;
tions ; he fluctuated between hope and fear ; i&#xD;
watched his every movement. But Babel kep&#xD;
at his work ; he turned the perspiring carcase&#xD;
he dipped the reeking juice% from the vess&#xD;
into which they trickled, and turned them upe&#xD;
the blistering flesh. The white trash, sensible o&#xD;
his superior skill, had fallen back, and relin&#xD;
quished the momentous business entirely to hi&#xD;
management.. Frederick tried to meet his-eye&#xD;
but Babel appeared entirely unconscious of hi&#xD;
presence. He was somewhat puzzled at thi&#xD;
but did not not lose heart and hope. Thi&#xD;
persecuted creature might be wiser and mo&#xD;
pdtic than he seemed.  If lie had saved hi&#xD;
once, had he not the same incentive to save hi&#xD;
again ? There is nothing so easy as for a mat&#xD;
to believe what is. agreeable to him ; and&#xD;
Frederick solaced him-elf with hope..&#xD;
The cooking of that Confederate pig was th&#xD;
most tedious process to Frederick that he ha&#xD;
over witnessed.  He wished a hundred time&#xD;
that it would take fire and consume in its ow&#xD;
fatness ; but nothing of the kind happened&#xD;
The steaming, roasting, basting, and burnie,&#xD;
were accomplished at length, and the savor&#xD;
object of so much care placed on a table before&#xD;
those who had been so long expecting its ad&#xD;
vent. Babel then drew out of the keg, into&#xD;
pail, what was left of its contents, and set it be&#xD;
fore the happy subjects of the new and grea&#xD;
Republic, who attacked it with as much freedo&#xD;
as if they had belonged to the smallest prince&#xD;
pality of the Fejee Islands.  It was a welcosel&#xD;
sight to Frederick, for he was well aware ti&#xD;
sleep would follow satiety and excess of dri.&#xD;
The belligerents had good appetites, an&#xD;
their feast was provokingly protracted. W ha&#xD;
lie anticipated came to pass, with a few excep&#xD;
tions. Three or four of them, instead of yield&#xD;
ing to the stupefying effects of the fiery beve&#xD;
'age, took on the wild and excited phase tha&#xD;
not unfrequently attends the drinking of larg&#xD;
quantities of alcoholic stimulants, and prove&#xD;

-&#xD;
&#xD;
not only annoying to their companions, but I&#xD;
dangerous to the prisoner.&#xD;
They were at first content with insulting re-&#xD;
marks ; but this not being satisfactory to their&#xD;
chivalry, they began to offer him personal in-&#xD;
dignities, They snapped- their fingers in his&#xD;
face, jostled him from side to side, pricked him&#xD;
with their bayonets, and were proceeding to&#xD;
more serious treatment, when Babel, who was&#xD;
now, apparently, as drunk as the rest, arose&#xD;
from the corner where he had been sitting, to&#xD;
all appearance asleep, his- great head swaying&#xD;
from side to side, and approached the scene of&#xD;
these unmanly Saggressions. His eyes shot&#xD;
flashes of light, and his gigantic frame quiver-&#xD;
ed with excitement.- Frederick marked him&#xD;
closely as he came. The scars on, his face&#xD;
stood out more palpably, and he plainly read&#xD;
read by the bright firelight the word "BABEL,"&#xD;
charred into the shriveled flesh of his arm. He&#xD;
caught the muskets from their hands and dart-&#xD;
ed them  through the window; then turning&#xD;
upon'the men themselves, beat them down with&#xD;
his great fists. The noise of their fall, and&#xD;
of the brief struggle that preceded it, awakened&#xD;
the corporal from his heavy slumbers. Seeing&#xD;
some of his men fall, and Babel standing over&#xD;
them in flaming woath, he staggered to his feet,&#xD;
and drawing his sword with much difficulty,&#xD;
shouted to his fellows to' get up and defend-&#xD;
themselves, for the devil or the Federals had&#xD;
come.&#xD;
The black, quite undismayed, sprang-to the&#xD;
table, seized the wreck of the roasted porker by&#xD;
the hinder legs, and swinging it over his head,&#xD;
to give it momeutnm, let it fly at 'the corporal&#xD;
with such force and precision, that lie was swept&#xD;
from his feet as effectually as if stricken by a&#xD;
cannon-ball. Babel was now master of the&#xD;
field. He giatched the corporal's sword from&#xD;
the floor where it had fallen, and set Freder-&#xD;
ick's limbs at liberty in a moment ; then, grasp-&#xD;
ing him firmly by the arm,-hurried, or rather&#xD;
dragged, him from the house. Some random&#xD;
and very scattering shots followed them.&#xD;
" Run, Mars'r North !" said Babel.&#xD;
Frederick heard this with amazement The&#xD;
dumb giant had spoken ! The young man&#xD;
could not refrain from exclaiming :&#xD;
" You speak l I thought you were dumb and&#xD;
deaf."&#xD;
"At times," answered Babel, hoarsely, "I&#xD;
-am mute as the' skies, and deaf as the clods we&#xD;
walk on. But to-night my senses are unsealed.&#xD;
I hear and I speak,"&#xD;
Frederick hastened on in silent wonder. Im-&#xD;
pelled by strong curiosity, he soon returned to&#xD;
the subject.&#xD;
" Do you, then, control the powers of speech&#xD;
and hearing ?" he asked, considering, with some-&#xD;
thing of awe, the grim figure at his side.&#xD;
" 1 do," replied Babel, solemnly. "I say to.&#xD;
my tongue, Speak not ! I say to my ears, Hear&#xD;
&#xD;
not ! and lo! -I am deaf and dumb. No sound&#xD;
reaches my soul, and no sound proceeds from&#xD;
it."&#xD;
" Why is this ?" inquired Frederick, his eu.&#xD;
riosity still more thoroughly aroused.&#xD;
- "Ask me not," 'muttered Babel, sombrely.&#xD;
"The time may soon come when you shall&#xD;
know. Till then, let me be Babel, the deaf&#xD;
mute. When my purpose is accomplished, I&#xD;
care not what 1 may be, or whether I shall have&#xD;
any being in this dusky form. When my work&#xD;
is done, this black-and unwieldy-frame may per-&#xD;
ish for aught I care. These corporate mem-&#xD;
bers may lie down with their. sears, and seams,&#xD;
and unhealed wounds, to become food for the&#xD;
crawling worm and the consuming mould. To&#xD;
mother earth resolved-dust to dust, and ele-&#xD;
ment to element surrendered ; then will enfl the&#xD;
career of the man-animal, Babel. I thank the&#xD;
mysterious powers of Nature that the white and&#xD;
the black man are hurrying to - one common&#xD;
grave."&#xD;
The black spoke with stirring vehemence.&#xD;
His petit-up passions, like an overpowering&#xD;
tide, gushed forth without restraint.&#xD;
"God is just '' answered Frederick.'&#xD;
" I know nothing of the Southern Go  ", es-.&#xD;
claimed Babel, fiercely, stopping suddenly, and&#xD;
turning upon Frederiek as if he would read him.&#xD;
" I care not to know the Deity that would op-&#xD;
press my race. They are weak fools who ac-&#xD;
cept the vile religion of their oppressors. It is&#xD;
enough that they wring gold and pleasure from&#xD;
our blood and our tears. Let them not force.&#xD;
upon us a religion that teaches them how to.&#xD;
whip, starve, and. break us down to the condi-&#xD;
dition of cattle, whose patient necks bear the&#xD;
galling yoke."     i&#xD;
He paused, and swept the sky with his long&#xD;
dark arm and hand.&#xD;
" The God I believe in, exists in yonder star-&#xD;
ry arch ;, but whether' he dwells in the moon,&#xD;
or in the sun, or in fields.of light far removed&#xD;
from mortal vision, I know not ; but if such a&#xD;
being lives, the white and the black Saxon will&#xD;
one day plead their cause together."&#xD;
He stopped again, then added :&#xD;
"But I have-done.' Speech is a mockery of&#xD;
human expression. I shall soon abjure it, and re-&#xD;
turn again to be the dumb devil I was. Betray&#xD;
me not till the time comes. Talk to me ne&#xD;
more at present, for we must hasten and I must&#xD;
soon leave you. By-and-by, I will free you&#xD;
from;those irons, andyou will be at liberty to&#xD;
resume your journey to Hilton Head."&#xD;
Babel went forward again like a race-horse,&#xD;
and Frederick followed him silently.&#xD;

CHAPTER XL..&#xD;
THE REAL, BEARER OF THE DISPATCHES FOUND..&#xD;
Babel halted presently, and with 'considera-&#xD;
ble.hammering and 'prying, relieved Frederick&#xD;
of the ironsouhis wiasts,.&#xD;
"If you would go to Hilton Head," he said,&#xD;
pointing with' big finger, "your way is yonder.&#xD;
The Federal fleet is riding in the harbor, and&#xD;
you may be, fortunate enough to pass the rebel&#xD;
pickets and reach it-in safety "&#xD;
1" But why should I go ?" asked Frederick.&#xD;
"My dispatches are gone, and I fear my honor&#xD;
is lost with-them." .&#xD;
"I know nothing-of your honor, whether lost&#xD;
or found," returned B  el. . "During my life-&#xD;
my miserable and oppressed life-I have seen&#xD;
little of the article you call honor I I have'known&#xD;
Cruelty and Rage, but never honor, in the white&#xD;
men that have claimed to own my flesh and my&#xD;
blood, and to guide my muscles and control my&#xD;
will. 'Cruelty and Rage have I known, and Re-&#xD;
venge comes next."&#xD;
The great, white rints 'of:Babel's eyes grew&#xD;
yellow with wrath. ,.His broad' chest heaved&#xD;
.and swelled like the waves of the sea, and Fred-&#xD;
erick beheld, with something like fear, the tre-&#xD;
mors of his muscular body.  "~ ...&#xD;
"It is the key of my lif !" muttered .Babel,&#xD;
huskily. " Revenge is the key of my life ; the&#xD;
key that locked up my soul in silence ; the key&#xD;
that kept me deaf, the 'key that shut me in with&#xD;
my own boiling and burning passions, to wait,&#xD;
with' weary and' wearing impatience,. the day&#xD;
and, the hour, and the momentof retaliation. It&#xD;
is near at hatde Notinueh moreiwatching and&#xD;
waiting ; not, much more reviling; not many&#xD;
more blows not inany more blood-hounds. As&#xD;
soon as the Northmen have taken Beaufort, there&#xD;
will besuch a sight as North Carolina never wit-&#xD;
nessed -before. A shout of joy will rise from&#xD;
the cotton-fields and rice-swamps, that will'make&#xD;
the white masters pale with terror.",&#xD;
I' ;'-And what do you think of Lowenthal?"&#xD;
Frederick inquired.&#xD;
r M'Mention- hita not t". cried. Babel, 'furiously.&#xD;
"Speak not hi accursed name!' Look here-.-m&#xD;
see this !"                 .   .      '&#xD;
{Babel lifted -up his branded arm. The soft&#xD;
lightiof the stars and the moon lay in white bil-&#xD;
Iowe on the-brown 'letters.' "BABEL, 1860", stood&#xD;
out as if every character clamored for attention.&#xD;
"It burns at this moment, as if the smoking&#xD;
irons were still eating into the flesh!" added&#xD;
Babel.' " Each letter-demahnds its separate ven-&#xD;
geance. 'I will give limnpain for pain, blow for&#xD;
low, and death fur all,!"&#xD;
He' gnashed his, teeth 'and: his wrath. grew&#xD;
startling. llolding his arm toward heaven, he&#xD;
exclaimed, with thrilling effect :&#xD;
"Let the God of the white man look down&#xD;
on this, and witness between the two races of&#xD;
men !"&#xD;
North, amazed and pwed, recoiled from Ba-&#xD;
&#xD;
bel and averted his eyes. . Immediately, Babel&#xD;
turned and strode away. Knowing it would be&#xD;
useless, the young man did not attempt to de-&#xD;
tain him, but stood thoughtfully where the&#xD;
black had left him.  ,       .&#xD;
Something dropping from a tree and falling&#xD;
beside ,ln made him jumpwith alarm, under&#xD;
the impression that a wild animal was about to&#xD;
attack him. Such a. rattling and scattering of&#xD;
the leaves followed, that Frederick could not in-&#xD;
stantly determine what kind of a creature had&#xD;
come ; but, by-and-by, by close examination,&#xD;
he was able to; separate some black feet from&#xD;
the revolving' mass;.and very soon' after, the&#xD;
crispy head and solemn face of Swampsey were&#xD;
mutely presented to view. , His surprise was&#xD;
great-; or he had given up all hopes of again&#xD;
seeing the foundling of Alligator Swiamp. But&#xD;
there he was, lithe and agile, and good as new.&#xD;
There was manifestly as much squirm, and&#xD;
twist, and leap-frog in him, as ever. He recol-&#xD;
lected most of the unique names that Angeline&#xD;
had called him, and could not help smiling as&#xD;
he contemplated the little fellow.-&#xD;
Swampsay's absence had not been unproduc-&#xD;
tive of results. He reappeared to his new master&#xD;
with some notable improvements in his toilet.&#xD;
He had discovered, somewhere in his travels, a&#xD;
pair oft honeopathie trowsers, which had-been&#xD;
tenanted originally by a very small child, and&#xD;
into these Swamps   ad crowded his eighteen&#xD;
inches of legs, and contrived, by pulling and&#xD;
tugging, to button the waistbands just above the,&#xD;
hips. The general effect of these trowsers was,&#xD;
to ,make the foundling's short. pilasters look like&#xD;
a pair of candle-molds ; and leaving, on ae-&#xD;
conat of the shortness.of the garment, a black&#xD;
selvedgeextending from the ankle half-way to&#xD;
the knee. When Frederick had time to take in&#xD;
the full stage-effect of this costume he forgot,&#xD;
in his sense of-the ludicrous, even te loss of his&#xD;
dispatches.. The tow-shirt, of which mention&#xD;
has been made in divers and sundry places,&#xD;
japanned with dirt and glazed with faithful serv-&#xD;
ice, was gracefully tucked under the trowsers,&#xD;
and fell in baggy festoons over the waistbands.&#xD;
"Where have you been, Swampsey ?" asked&#xD;
Frederick.&#xD;
" Been 'way, Mars'r Fred," replied the found-&#xD;
ling, in a voice as straight on as usual.&#xD;
This reply was so obviously true, that North&#xD;
had nothing to say about it.&#xD;
"But why did you leave me ?" continued&#xD;
Frederick.&#xD;
"'Cause I went off," drawled Swampsey.&#xD;
This was so exceedingly. reasonable, that&#xD;
Frederick.had not a word to urge against it.&#xD;
" Do you know what happened after I went&#xD;
tasleep^".queried North.&#xD;
', Tole ye not to go 'to sleep, Mars'r Fred.&#xD;
But you would go to sleep. If you'd kept your&#xD;
eyes yopen, you wouldn't gone to sleep. Soger.&#xD;
nmen come and took Mars'r Fred."&#xD;
&#xD;
Seampsey tried to insinuate his hands into&#xD;
the pockets of his new trowsers, which were&#xD;
drawn so tightly around his little body, that it&#xD;
was impossible for him to insert more than ones&#xD;
finger. This, howevet,gave him ample satisfac-&#xD;
tion, And lie threw a somerset on the strength&#xD;
of it.&#xD;
"That was. not all, my sooty gymnast," said&#xD;
North. "Did you see Peter Rust sew some pa-&#xD;
pe s into'the linings of my eoAt ?"&#xD;
" See Mars'-r iPeter put 'em in," answered the&#xD;
foundling. '"Mars'r Peter wanted 'em ear'd safe'&#xD;
down to them yer Yanks, as am goin' to -hoot&#xD;
the, rotten shot at de big forts. Know- what&#xD;
Mars'r Peter want, well 'nough. Don't want&#xD;
them yer papers"lost."&#xD;
"Lost they are, at all, events, to my shame&#xD;
did disgrace be it -spoken !" exclaied Frede-&#xD;
riek,"-despondingly.  "Poor little fragient' of&#xD;
life !" he added, abstractedly. "He cannot&#xD;
realize how much I have lost in those , dis-&#xD;
'atches.  Possibly I may hav 'lot Milrose.&#xD;
atmysterious money-lender' intimated that'&#xD;
my success depended upon the faithfulness with&#xD;
Which I discharged this trust. Well, I have to'&#xD;
thank myself for it.. I was atupidly forgetful of,&#xD;
iy duty and the responsibility'of my mission.'&#xD;
O Mijrose ! Milrose !"&#xD;
"Got 'em yer," said Swamps y, laying his&#xD;
hand ubon the breast of his tow-shut. "Seed&#xD;
'en in like Mats'r Peter."&#xD;
A 'gleam of .indescribable triumph 'flicered&#xD;
over the foundling's face.&#xD;
"Got the dispatohea ?" exelaited Pe leriok,&#xD;
i ieedulously.&#xD;
"aIn yer," responded $wampsey, pointing 'tb'&#xD;
1is bosom.&#xD;
"In there I" repeated FredeIck, atilI it&#xD;
dopbt whether he undeitood hitn.&#xD;
The black dwarf winked and blinked nfflrma-&#xD;
tively.&#xD;
" How did you get therfi ?" demanded Fred-&#xD;
ariek, somewhat sternly.&#xD;
" Cut 'em out Mare'r Fred's coat. Mars'r Fred&#xD;
*AM 'sleep," replied' Swampsey, perfectly self-&#xD;
asetsed.&#xD;
"'You !" cried Frederick, quite confoundedd.&#xD;
A 'ou cut the linings of my cont! Yf6u take&#xD;
but the dis' catches ind iake off with' them'!"&#xD;
V Yes, .nirs'r Fred," responded' S*aiapse&#xD;
Nte dily, with a benign wag of the head&#xD;
What fort ?" interrogated' Frederik', whose&#xD;
wotider had not abated.&#xD;
- 'to keep 'em,' replied 'Skampsey  :"Inew&#xD;
got'd'be botched, and Mare'r Peter ' wants 'en&#xD;
tbokdu dowi yon. Was goin' down with 'em.'&#xD;
gMetabel. Babel told 'me to wait out yer. and&#xD;
I t aited. TIhese be the papers."&#xD;
h                     pampsey pressed a 'black "finger 'upon' his&#xD;
breast again.     '&#xD;
"live 'them to ie,'said Frederilt, advane-&#xD;
in n holding rout  rdshand. ed S&#xD;
-Keep 'em for Mars'r Fred," answered Swam p -&#xD;
&#xD;
sey, with immovable gravity. "Nobody wont&#xD;
know whar' to find 'em."&#xD;
"What! you keep them ?" demanded North,&#xD;
who was unprepared for this announcement.&#xD;
" Why,,"'he added, with a smile, "if they.are&#xD;
discovered concealed in your shirt, you will be&#xD;
hanged as a spy."&#xD;
" Be hung- for Mars'r Peter," said"the found-&#xD;
ling. " Don't 'care what happens if they get&#xD;
the papers down you."&#xD;
" ou are too small to take charge of them,"&#xD;
remonstrated Frederick, who was overjoyed' to&#xD;
find that the dispatches were not irrecoverably&#xD;
lost. , "Besides, you may lose them in some of&#xD;
your ground and lofty tumhlings."&#xD;
. Swampsey shook his head in solemn and ut-&#xD;
ter contradiction of this possibility.&#xD;
" Can't git out. Fastened in tight. Sh 'n't&#xD;
go to sleep."&#xD;
The closing argument of Swampsey's remarks&#xD;
was one that came close home to the conscience&#xD;
of the young man. He really felt confused be-&#xD;
fore this odd little creature. Sleep, indeed I&#xD;
It was wellithought of. - It was aptly spoken by&#xD;
Svatmpscy. Frederick reflected. The lad had&#xD;
displayed remarkable instincts. H1is mysteri-&#xD;
ous foresight had probably saved his dispatch-&#xD;
es front the 'rebels, and very probably his own&#xD;
life. Why should he not trust him ?' He had&#xD;
proved 'the more faithful of the two. There&#xD;
were no good reasons why he should not allow&#xD;
him to retain the papers ; and as he was resolv-&#xD;
ed to do so, 'whether he sented or dissented,&#xD;
he made a virtue of necessity, and made no&#xD;
further efforts'to get possession of them.&#xD;
i" Do' as you like," said Frederick. " Per,&#xD;
laps your plan is the best. So far, at least,&#xD;

moderation.' Frederick followed him with great"&#xD;

the morning rays were gilding the treetops,&#xD;
came in sight-of a house, toward which 'the&#xD;

The countenane of Frederick he now watchU&#xD;
very closely-seeming, like the faithful dog, to&#xD;
get the meaning of his master' from his silent&#xD;
face.&#xD;
Having left Ela at the house, the parties re-&#xD;
turned to the shore at a point where the land&#xD;
ran: farthest to the sea, in the direction of Hil-&#xD;
ton Head. The' defensive works of the rebels&#xD;
were plainly distinguishable. Lying off, out of&#xD;
each of the guns, was the flag-ship withwhich&#xD;
Frederick was so anxious to communicate.&#xD;
Frederick looked at it with wishful and restless&#xD;
eyes. Swampsey, the important bearer, 'of the&#xD;
dispatches, sauntered about with, his hands be-&#xD;
hind him,'apparently the most unconcerned of&#xD;
the party. He kept remarkably to the ground,&#xD;
not once revolving like a wheel, standing on his&#xD;
head, spinning'round like a top, nor throwing a&#xD;
single somerset, till, their guide'dragged a very&#xD;
'small boat from among the shrubbery, and&#xD;
laiichied it-upon the water ; then he executed&#xD;
one of the most wonderful aerial baltations ever&#xD;
recorded in history.: Having ventilated his&#xD;
feelings in this manner, he waited with lively'&#xD;
interest the development of events.. The boat-&#xD;
man appeared in no hurry. His notions were&#xD;
notably slow and hesitating. He looked often&#xD;
towArd the Confedefe batteries.&#xD;
,' We are a little  ,"'he said, apologetical-&#xD;
Iy  "The moon ut     ifle too high."'&#xD;
" The 'danger ni be encountered, at all&#xD;
events," replied Frederick, with decision.&#xD;
"This little cockle-shell -of a boat will be&#xD;
blown out of the water," returned the boatman,&#xD;
shaking his head dubiously. " There are plenty&#xD;
of glasses 'sweeping yonder sheet' of water .to-.&#xD;
night. A hundred eyes will see you before you&#xD;
have passed half the distance; and a dozen ri-&#xD;
fled-cannon will send their gompliments." ,&#xD;
" Neither eyes, nor glasses, not rifle-shot shall&#xD;
deter rne 'from discharging my duty. ' I ask no&#xD;
one to attend me. I know enough'of boat-craft&#xD;
to row myself to yonder ship."&#xD;
"wampsey lost not a word of this discourse,&#xD;
and evidently comprehendingthe exact gtate of-&#xD;
affairs, threw himself into the boat with incon-&#xD;
ceivable quicknesss, and seizing' one of the&#xD;
ears, 'lbich were very' light, pushed from the&#xD;
shore before any One could interfere to prevent&#xD;
him.. When out of reach, he east overboard&#xD;

trapid'ty. It was in vainthat the boatman shouted&#xD;
-after him. P=It was in vain that Frederick called&#xD;
tOehim tg dome back. The foundling of Alli-&#xD;
gator Swamp  nanifestly had a will of his own,&#xD;
and gave -no more heed to the frantic cominands,&#xD;
and gestures of Frederick than to the tumbling&#xD;
of the spray, upon thg headland. Away he&#xD;
went, dispatches and all. ,Pespite his chagrin,&#xD;
the young man could not forbear smiling at the&#xD;
absurdity of the situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
N-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER- .                 9&#xD;
"You'll never see that contraband again,"&#xD;
said the boatman, shrugging his shoulders.&#xD;
" You'll see a flash over yonder presently."&#xD;
He leveled his finger toward the Confederate&#xD;
works.  Meantime, Swampsey, perched upon&#xD;
one side of the boat, plied the paddle brisky,&#xD;
and the frail vessel glided over the long and&#xD;
regular swells with much more velocity than&#xD;
could have been expected.&#xD;
The moon was high above the clouds ; its&#xD;
long white beams trembled like shafts of silver&#xD;
along the heaving water, and bathed with mel-&#xD;
low light both fleet and battery. The same&#xD;
great fountain shed equal blessings on friend&#xD;
and foe. It-was a spectacle that one might see&#xD;
but once in a lifetime -, the sight of a century&#xD;
-ship and transport, tug and steamer, compris,&#xD;
ing the great naval expedition, riding calmly at&#xD;
their moorings in that magnificent harbor, al-&#xD;
most' within range of the Confederate batteries.&#xD;
Between the rebel works and the Federhl&#xD;
fleet, tossing on the waves like an egg-shell, was&#xD;
the little boat containing Swampsey and the dis-&#xD;
patches,' and which, though now but a mere&#xD;
speck, soon became an object of attention to&#xD;
ship and shore. There was a bright flash from&#xD;
one of the island-batteries, and then a booming&#xD;
sound rolled-out to sea ; while, simultaneously,&#xD;
a large shot went skipping from billow to billow,&#xD;
finally disappearing far beyond Swampsey. But&#xD;
the founding heeded not this salutation, but&#xD;
continued to propel his bark with a 'steady pur-&#xD;
pose. Shot after shot followed this serious ad-&#xD;
monition. Rebel balls fell like hail around the&#xD;
impassive little black. Frederick became pain-&#xD;
fully interested. With a glass, which their&#xD;
guide had brought, he kept an anxious watch of&#xD;
the boat and its occupant.&#xD;
" His head is gone !" he exclaimed, as Se thire-&#xD;
ty-two-pound rifle-shot went shrieking in fearful&#xD;
nearness to the undaunted voyager, and he sud-&#xD;
denly disappeared.&#xD;
"Nay, lie je up again," said Martin."He&#xD;
as saved his head by dropping into the bottom&#xD;
the beat."&#xD;
" 1e'stands on the gunnel, dipping his paddle&#xD;
as briskly as ever," exclaimed Frederick, ex.&#xD;
citedly. "The foundling of Alligator Swamp&#xD;
bears. a charmed life. Really, I am very anxious&#xD;
for the'safety of this little fellow. The Confed-&#xD;
erates are firing for practice, and some of them&#xD;
are very good ,range-shots. It is unmanly to&#xD;
keep up such a thunder of artillery on so small&#xD;

he disappeared under the dark bows of the "Wa-&#xD;
bash". But a short time.elapsed before l'reder-&#xD;
iak saw something, which he supposed to be his&#xD;
pigmy body, drawn up over the side, and de-&#xD;
posited on the deck. -&#xD;
"His, mission is accomplished !" exclaimed&#xD;
the young man, relieved of an unpleasant load&#xD;
of suspense and responsibility..&#xD;
"SAnd all for Mars'r Pieter," observed Martin.&#xD;
"Had Peter of, the Pines wished those papers&#xD;
conveyed to Foi-t Walker, they would have been&#xD;
carried there with esal fidelity."&#xD;
"He will not ooine baek, certainly," said&#xD;
North, somewhat uneasily.  1&#xD;
"Verily, he will return, friend Frederick,"&#xD;
answered Martin. "Nothing can keep' him a,&#xD;
moment longer than needful from his beloved&#xD;
Peter. Look ! he goes over the side of the ship,,&#xD;
and -and'now he is in his egg-shell again. He'll&#xD;
come back, though a thousand hatteries roar at&#xD;
him.".&#xD;
Broadbent was right. Back paddled Swamp-.,&#xD;
sey, through bursting shell and bowling shot.&#xD;
The iron hail and the sulphurous flash were the'&#xD;
same to him. Columbiad and mortar, rifled&#xD;
Armstrong and Whitworth, carronade' azd swiv-&#xD;
el, ten-pounder or hundred-pounder, were of&#xD;
like significance to this unique bearer of dis-&#xD;
patches; and he cared not the snapping of a&#xD;
thumb and finger for the whole of them.,&#xD;
Perched on the gunnel, his dwarfed proportions'&#xD;
were the focus of hundreds of curious and inter-&#xD;
ested eyes. Both sailors and soldiers watched&#xD;
his passage to and from the flag-ship, noment-&#xD;
arily expecting to see boy and boat swept from&#xD;
the water like a speck of sea-foam.'&#xD;

Although Frederick had wished to be the spe-&#xD;
cial bearer of the 'dispatchs to the flag-ship,.he&#xD;
was not disposed to murmur'at' what lad oc-&#xD;
curred, or to envy the-laurels b Swaiipsey.&#xD;
The latter celebrated -hia success by four rand&#xD;
consecutive double-somersets, the first"-of the'&#xD;
series being thrown with u usual sprightliness&#xD;
from the bow of the boat." He infused into this&#xD;
performance 'at 'least one-foundling .power-&#xD;
speaking after the manner of horse-pyee sind'&#xD;
dog-power, with bark-grinding and culinary re-&#xD;
miniseendes in view.&#xD;
On being questioned, Swam sey'was as clear&#xD;
and lumiinons in 'his answers as he had been at&#xD;
any time since Frederick had, been blest with&#xD;
the inestimable 'treasirl of fhis'society.'&#xD;
"6Why did you'play ine such a trick!" asked&#xD;
Frederick, intending to bequite ste-n.'&#xD;
"1Went off in the boat," answered'the hero of&#xD;
Alligator Swamp, his eyes Working at the rate&#xD;
of a hundred winks a minute.    'Let' Mars'r&#xD;

'"'I know you did," said Frederick, biting his&#xD;

aious to go to the flag-ship myself."s&#xD;
" Mars'r Fred didn't. go," quoth Swampsey,&#xD;
with the 'same truthful felicity. '&#xD;
" I certainly did not," said North, who found&#xD;
it difficult to feign anger which he did not feel.&#xD;
'"Did you deliver the papers ?"    - '&#xD;
"No, didn't d'liver 'em, Maih'r.Fred," drawl-&#xD;
ed 'the' fou'dling, his eyes revolving rapidly,&#xD;
and liistirongcontradiction of the idea, as he un-&#xD;
deratood it, contained in the last query.&#xD;
"What did you 'do with them, then1?".de-&#xD;
manded Frederick, considerably startled.,&#xD;
" Giv' 'em to the man with the gold things&#xD;
on his shoulders.  Tole him you brung 'eni&#xD;

emn honesty of look.&#xD;
" Thou apeakest' beyond his comprehension,'&#xD;
friend' Frederick," obse-ved Martin.  " Thou&#xD;
shouldst use simple langiigp when thou confer-&#xD;

"Wiat'did the-inan with the things  "*dis&#xD;

" Ie Went down cellar I" laughed the young&#xD;

"Did the commodore say. that the 'papers&#xD;

"No.;" said he liked 'em," replied Swam psey&#xD;
repelling by a solemn' shake of the head the&#xD;
idea that they were valuable.&#xD;

" Is this belief prevalent at Forts Walker and&#xD;

"It is freely talked of, and fully believed in&#xD;
byoficers and men," answered Lovelace. " But&#xD;
it is regretted that so many ships of war should&#xD;
be sunk when the new Republic has so much&#xD;
need of them. But I have been too frank. I&#xD;

known to you. They will remove you to the&#xD;
house, where your wounds will be properly&#xD;

Peter Rust and Mattin Broadbent appeared,&#xD;
guided by Swampsey, who moved along before&#xD;
them with as much self-possession as if war and&#xD;
wounds had been his particular business since'&#xD;
he was fished out of Alligator, Swamp.&#xD;
Swampsey was none of your common found-&#xD;

never muddled in his ideas, nor disturbed him-&#xD;
self greatly about any one save Peter Rust, who&#xD;
was six feet two, and himself just three feet&#xD;
nothing. Gunboats and batteries were to him&#xD;
of no'more importance than the tall trees of the&#xD;
Pine Barrens. The biggest Columbiad ever cast&#xD;
was not half so wonderful to him as Peter&#xD;
Rust's double gun.&#xD;
Peter and Martin took up Lovelace, and carried&#xD;
him carefully to the house; while Frederick&#xD;
thoughtfully followed, Swampsey making re-&#xD;
mnarkably long, strides at his side, in an imita-&#xD;
tive effort to keep pace with him.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVII&#xD;
A GRoUP ON THE SHORE.&#xD;
Early the following morning, a boat, contain-&#xD;
ing three persons, touched the island. Those&#xD;
three persons were : Lowenthal, Babel, and Ben&#xD;
Dykes. Like hundreds of others, Lowenthal&#xD;
was desirous of seeing the conflict about to take&#xD;
place between the Confederate forts and the&#xD;
Federal fleets ; hence his visit to the island.&#xD;
The sun was just above the horizon, aild the&#xD;
day promised to be unusually fine. The gun-&#xD;
boats lay quietly in the harbor ; but, with his&#xD;
glass, he could see-that the men were astir.&#xD;
&#xD;
Leaving Ben Dykes to watch the boat, he&#xD;
walked toward the palmetto growth attended by&#xD;
Babel.  He loitered among the trees.   He&#xD;
sauntered to and fro, thinking of the failure of&#xD;
many of his plans,.and querying what influence&#xD;
victory or defeat would exercise upon his for-&#xD;
tunes. This was not a cheerful employment,&#xD;
and he often listened for some premonitory gun&#xD;
from ship or shore, that, in the more exciting&#xD;
scene of the fight, his mind might be diverted&#xD;
from personal matters far from pleasant. He&#xD;
could not feel that'he had been very successful&#xD;
in his aspirations ; he could not count the gains&#xD;
of his intriguing life; he could not reach out&#xD;
his hand and seize-the object of his ambition.&#xD;
He had built many castles high in air, which he&#xD;
was never to inhabit. - He sighed because he had&#xD;
accomplished so little ; because his pathway had&#xD;
been so crooked ; because villainy had brought&#xD;
no glad fruition ; because dishonesty had been&#xD;
loss, and ambition mockery, and hope delusion.&#xD;
He thought of the motherless girl, her wealth,&#xD;
her plantation, hey negroes, defrauded from her&#xD;
by himself, and conveyed to Markthaler--the&#xD;
keen, the cruel, the pitiless usurer. He knew-&#xD;
how well he knew that he was in the power of&#xD;
that pale-lipped man! He cherished a deadly&#xD;
hatred 'for the money-lender.' He' meant to be&#xD;
even with him yet, He would not be taunted&#xD;
and mocked at mueh'longer. He motioned Ba-&#xD;
belto him. The black giant came and stood&#xD;
before him. The morning sun-rays fell very&#xD;
bright and golden on the sooty face, and the&#xD;
broad chest, and the bare arms of the slave.&#xD;
Those arms were crossed upon his breast ; and&#xD;
on one of them the cotton-planter read, with a&#xD;
strange shudder:&#xD;
BABEL&#xD;
1860&#xD;
It was singular that his eyes should fall on&#xD;
'those characters just then, when he was about&#xD;
to confer confidentially with his property. He&#xD;
inwardly cursed the fatality and its prophecy.&#xD;
How should he communicate with this mute&#xD;
creature ? He thought of a way. He took out&#xD;
his purse, then feigned to put glasses upon his&#xD;
eyes, and imitated the gaitof Markthaler. His&#xD;
dumb devil-nodded intelligibly and continuous-&#xD;
ly. Lowenthal knew that the wonderful quick-&#xD;
ness of the black had caught his meaning. He&#xD;
drew a dagger from his breast, unsheathed it,&#xD;
and holding up the purse, made passes at it with&#xD;
the point. Babel nodded again as apprehen-&#xD;
sively as before, and pointed, to his heart.&#xD;
" Yes," said Lowenthal, momentarily forget-&#xD;
ting.the deafness of his slave. " You are to kill&#xD;
him ; you are to strike him dead i"&#xD;
Babel raised his branded arm, and leveled it&#xD;
toward a pathway near at hand. Lowenthal&#xD;
looked : there stood Markthaler and Milrose.&#xD;
The cotton-planter was never more amazed. lie&#xD;
did not stir-lie did not withdraw his gaze-lie&#xD;

106            MILROSE; OR, THE COTT(&#xD;
The two advanced-the money-lender and Mil-&#xD;
rose.,                   .&#xD;
" You informed me, not long since, that you&#xD;
had something 0to say to this young lady. If&#xD;
you were in earnest, and have not since changed&#xD;
your mind, you can now speak freely."&#xD;
" Not here," answered Lowenthal, quite con-&#xD;
founded. "Let us walk down to the shore.&#xD;
Really, I am confused. Milrose, how do you do,&#xD;
child? What put you to running away? I was&#xD;
infinitely pained by your distrust, my girl. But&#xD;
I shall not scold you. Take my arm."&#xD;
"Excuse me," said Milrose. "It is enough&#xD;
if I walk near you."&#xD;
They proceeded toward the shore. As soon&#xD;
as they emerged from the wood, they saw the&#xD;
"Wabash" moving straight on toward.Fort Walk-&#xD;
er, followed in regular order by such of the gun-1&#xD;
boats as were going into action.&#xD;
"Milrose," said Lowenthal, sentimentally,&#xD;
" This is destined to be a thrilling day. Before&#xD;
the Lincoln fleet is sent to the bottom, decide-&#xD;
one thing for me. The relation that has existed&#xD;
between us has been but a nominal one. No&#xD;
kindred blood flows in our veins. Marry me I"&#xD;
Milrose stopped ; she looked steadily at Low-&#xD;
enthal. The girlish form assumed a dignity&#xD;
that was new to her strange -suitor. Increduli-&#xD;
ty, pride, scorn, and indignation agitated her&#xD;
thoughts. While she stood thus, beautiful and&#xD;
silent, a thunderous roar from the flag-shipphook&#xD;
the island. It was Dupont's first terrific salute.&#xD;
Milrose peeled it not. The audacity of her&#xD;
mother's husband engrossed all her conscious-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
Markthaler placed himself where he could see&#xD;
her face, the other side of Lowenthal, and made&#xD;
earnest signs to her, and Jacob, who had just ar-&#xD;
rived, repeated them.&#xD;
" Wait a little," said Milrose,. restraining her&#xD;
contempt. " There is one whom you shall con-&#xD;
sult presently. If that person consents, then&#xD;
you shall hear my sentiments."&#xD;
Lowenthal thought he saw a glimmering of&#xD;
hope ; and he was sure that he saw Frederick&#xD;
North and Angeline approaching. This discov-&#xD;
ery occasioned him infinite surprise ; and he&#xD;
was little pleased with this addition to the party.&#xD;
But other persons were hurrying to the shore,&#xD;
attracted by the roar of artillery ; and he trust-&#xD;
ed that he should escape attention, on account&#xD;
of the thrilling and absorbing interest of the&#xD;
scene in the harbor. He did not feel entirely&#xD;
assured of this, however. He feared that this&#xD;
obnoxious young man would come too near, and,&#xD;
in some manner, cross his purposes. His first&#xD;
apprehension was quite right ; for Frederick and&#xD;
Angeline soon added two more to the little&#xD;
group.&#xD;
" Love o' God, Miss Milly! What ye down&#xD;
here for ?" said Angeline. "'Pears like you run&#xD;
away from the house."&#xD;
'e:r c s falling upon ,Lowenithal at that in-&#xD;
&#xD;
'ON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
stant, she recoiled, in the greatest consterna-&#xD;

" Laws, Miss Milly !" she added, in a sup-&#xD;
pressed voice. "Tell ye what! I's cl'ar done&#xD;
scared. If Peter or some on 'em don't take car'&#xD;
on us, we'll be toted right back to the planta-&#xD;
tion. And there's that great silent Babel and&#xD;
Turpentine Ben. Wonder what he wants ?&#xD;
Looks g1um enough anyways I"            -&#xD;
Receiving no answer from Milrose, the girl&#xD;
put her sharp eyes into use, and soon perceived&#xD;
that her mistress was unusually dignified, and&#xD;
that something serious had passed, or was pend-&#xD;
ing, between her and Lowenthal. As for Fred-&#xD;
erick, he beheld this intruder with astonishment&#xD;
and secret fear. Seeing ,Milrose, his lingering&#xD;
doubts concerning the identity of the person&#xD;
whom he had encountered in the palmetto-walks,&#xD;
on the previous night, were dispelled. Why had&#xD;
she kept herself aloof, when she, unquestiona-&#xD;
bly, knew that he was on the island,? Yes, it&#xD;
was Milrose that he had met, and Peter,Rust&#xD;
must have been in the secret of her coming.&#xD;
But hecould, not understand so much secrecy.&#xD;
New influences must have been brought to bear.&#xD;
upon her. Something was.in progress that was&#xD;
both mysterious and alarming. Would she no-&#xD;
tice him now-? The question was quickly an-&#xD;
swered. She turned to him with a kindly smile,&#xD;
and said :&#xD;
"Good-morning, Mr. North."&#xD;
"Good-morning, Miss Dorn," answered Fred-&#xD;
erick, bowing. " Your presence here is quite a&#xD;
surprise to me."&#xD;
"And my own, no less," interposed Lowen-&#xD;
thal, with a frown and a menacing glance.&#xD;
"And yours, no less !" repeated Frederick,&#xD;
calmly.&#xD;
"Truly the firing is terrific !" said a voice,&#xD;
which caused the cotton-planter to start as if&#xD;
he had received a blow. Looking over his shoul-&#xD;
der, he saw his overseer, Martin Broadbent, who&#xD;
had hastened to the shore to witness the fight.&#xD;
" Verily, the earth shakes beneath us.. The&#xD;
slaughter will be great."&#xD;
Stand behind me, Jacob," exclaimed Mark-&#xD;
thaler.&#xD;
" Stand behind me, Babel," repeated the&#xD;
planter, mockingly. Then, to Frederick: "You&#xD;
are in time, young man, to see the Lincoln fleet&#xD;
sent to the bottom of the sea. By nice calcula-&#xD;
tion, based on infallible data, the Confederate&#xD;
engineers at Fort Walker have arrived at the&#xD;
conclusion that it wil take just twenty minutes&#xD;
