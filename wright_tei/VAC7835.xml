So arter they had dun singing, the squire had his car-&#xD;

lodge to his house, as he couldn't think to hav 'em go to&#xD;
the.tavurn where their was no peeple hoo was perlte&#xD;
enuff to keep there company. So they awl got in the&#xD;
carridge and drive off. Sister Sally run and held the step&#xD;
for 'em as they got in, and she bowed when they driv off.&#xD;
Arter we got home, i went to speak to sister Sally,-and&#xD;
she turned up her nose at me' andsez she--' dogt speak&#xD;

YANKEE LETTER.&#xD;
There was a gal wonst up in our parts named Sal&#xD;
Splitten. Sal and me was acquainted from the earliest&#xD;
of         intanse, ad when we was little, we used to&#xD;
carry a jug of 'lasses together. You can ax Mister Mul-&#xD;
lin about that, hoo used to keep the west injee store&#xD;
down by the turn in the rode. near Sigh Snuffle's house.&#xD;
So as Sal begun to grow up and her frock got two short&#xD;
for her, she used to squint sat me kinder sly, and she&#xD;
wouldn't put her arms round my neck as she used.&#xD;
As for my part, i went to the cow-yard and i begun to&#xD;
talk of setting' up with the gals. So mother made a soot&#xD;
of pper and salt close, and i felt as grand as nue beans&#xD;
and then left off keepin' low company and always kept&#xD;
company with sich folkes as Jim Jewel the hossler at the&#xD;
taverkand Sam Pease boo hd a nue soot of brown close.&#xD;
Then thegalsbegun to look at me in meeting' time and&#xD;
Wunst i slapt that 'Ting Brown in the face for starring at&#xD;
me for i that drest well and had learning didn't like for&#xD;
to have. ich low peepo stick up to me.&#xD;
As for SalSplitten, ihad a notion arter her, but i kind-&#xD;
r felt two big to go to see her for she wore a sort of&#xD;
of brown frok that nant no grate things. So i kept&#xD;
awayfrom the house a good yile ; but at last she cum to&#xD;
I  eetip'nnwith a pretty French print on, and then 1 watched&#xD;
her till meetin' was out and i run up to her and sez--&#xD;
'The fatigues of the e nin' to yer, Miss Splittent' When&#xD;
Salherd me saythat her eyes snapt for joy and she was&#xD;
dredfl truck with my poughliteness, and she put her&#xD;
aritiermine and we walked alone together.&#xD;
reaeder tocum to see her, tho' i telled her that&#xD;
didn't eggzaklylike to marry inter, her family, wich&#xD;
was rahter a low won;" but as she'd gut a new frock, i'd&#xD;

Then i went a. corting Sal, and i kept it up for six&#xD;
weeks; but then i'd got up two high in the world to think&#xD;
of her any longer. They tawked of puttin me up to go&#xD;
to the legislatur and vote for president and drink a health&#xD;
to the country where i was bred and bornd. So they told&#xD;
me i must maik a speech and it must be a stump speech,&#xD;
i couldn't find any stump to stand on, and so i goes. and&#xD;
gets up on a hoss block, and i sais, sais i-.-.&#xD;

'We've cum together thin day to 'lect me to the legis.&#xD;

are to fite for freedom, as gineral washington did. We&#xD;
are to lick the british with injines of destruction and to&#xD;
obey the ten commandments from our yuth up. I don't&#xD;
want to make my brags about niyself now for nothing;&#xD;
but i say it, that i've got good relations as-well as anoth-&#xD;

prodigious. For skinning a sheep i'll turn my back tono&#xD;
man, and so if you 'lect me to the legislatryucntd&#xD;
a better thing.&#xD;
When i'd sed all this, they clapt their hands and give&#xD;
me 3 chairs.&#xD;
They sed the speech ought to be printed and put in the&#xD;
papers and sent off to the president. So i went to the&#xD;
additur of the GreenJuzzard and axed him to print 'it&#xD;
and he telled me to right it down tho he wAs there ad&#xD;
cheered it himself. i went hum andwi could find no ink-&#xD;

.Music hath boirmis to soothe the savage.&#xD;
To open rocks and split a cabbage.'&#xD;
In de fust beginniii' ob die church w;hab musio in dies&#xD;
house. Tony Jumbo played on de fiddle and better . Wid-&#xD;
geon played on de hano. You raccolleck dat berry well.&#xD;
We use music bekase it sounded pretty and hab eharmto&#xD;
it. You recolleck berry well that Sam Jonsing was head&#xD;
in dem times, and Sam was the great musikiaier for sing-&#xD;
in'. Sometimes he sing so loud dat you tink de ruf ob&#xD;
de house was gwoine to come off. Dat was great, be-&#xD;
kase you sing in church to be heered in hebben and as&#xD;
hebben is great ways off, darfore you muss sing berry&#xD;
loud, or else dey won't heah you dar.&#xD;
One time Sam Jossing sung so loud dat-his voice knock&#xD;
downde 'tove pipe. Dat create great rewival for few mi-&#xD;
nutes, bekase dey thought de debble was coming arter dar&#xD;
sins.&#xD;
Anudder time Sam Jonsing and Love Wheeler was&#xD;
singi' berry loud togedder and dey gotra going and dey&#xD;
couldn't stop. Sam pulled off his coat-and jacket to-it,&#xD;
and Love flung down her bonnet on- de floor. Dat was&#xD;
great time for religion in der days, I 'sure you.&#xD;
De text tell you, in a 'ticlar manner, dat, music hab&#xD;
charm to soothe de savage. Darfote you larn from  die&#xD;
fuss part ob de text, dat music am 'tended 'ticklarly for&#xD;
de savage. When de savage heap music it sooth him&#xD;
berry much. Dat am de reason dat mineral Jackson. when&#xD;
he go wid sogrs to fight de savage berry much, hab mu-&#xD;

of myself to fetch and carry and be a dog tohim, i'd take&#xD;
him by the skerf of the nick and snake -him to the mill-&#xD;
pond, and when i got him- there i'd push him into it. That's&#xD;
my mind, and i'll always stick up-for my own sect, and i&#xD;
wnt that my sect should have no sufferance, and should&#xD;
be treated rite, and now you nose my minded for i'm right&#xD;
- up and down, and i don't kear who hears me, and you noe&#xD;
i mean it all for your good, Aloyrah, and its bekase i.&#xD;
want you should be hapty as you ought to be, and you&#xD;
must let your husband noe that you won't bear no none-&#xD;
sense of him, and when he finds you won't put up with&#xD;
nothin' he'll nock under and will be obedient to you, as&#xD;
my mother's husband always was to her.&#xD;
So i went off and left her all in the suds, and she was&#xD;
unplushed. About a week arter that i went- over to see&#xD;
how Aloyrah cum on, and i found that she had took my&#xD;
advice, and she went and told her husbandhe must.draw&#xD;
her water, and she telled him that he must larn to be ob-&#xD;
edunt. She kept at him and tride to brake him just like&#xD;
you brake a young colt.. Now what do you think that&#xD;
nasty, good-for-nothin'. man done. He refuse4, rite up and&#xD;
down. to peal the vigittable, and hang on the pot for din&#xD;
ner. Then she busted out a cryin' and sed she wood tell&#xD;
me, the first time she saw ine, and she went and put on&#xD;
her hat, and he forbid her to go: then she went up stares&#xD;
and he cookt his own dinner, and she's never got a meel&#xD;
for him sense. But the worst of it is to come. i went to&#xD;
the house and Aloyrah telled me all this : and then her&#xD;
husband cum in and 'quested me to stay athum in future.&#xD;
Then i give it to him, and i telled him that he was a sas-&#xD;

sy blaggudr and i sed everything i could lay my tongue&#xD;
and i teller him i wood hav nothin' to do with him, and i&#xD;
wood cum and see Aloyrah whenever i pleased. The, 1&#xD;
out and slammed the door arter me.&#xD;
Now what do you think ? He has acted so bad that&#xD;
i've advised 'Aloyrah to get a divoce from him, rite off,&#xD;
for- he's forbid my cuming into his house and he fastens&#xD;
the door whenever i go there. And nog arter all my en-&#xD;
divors to make piece in that family and to teach Aloyrah&#xD;
how to cultivate her husband, she shuts me out of the&#xD;
house ; but i'm rite up and down, and i stand up for my&#xD;
own sect. Arter these actions towards me, i've advised&#xD;
Aloyrah to git a divose from him, for there's a plenty of&#xD;
men, and if she wants a new husband, she can get a&#xD;
plenty arter she'sdivosed. As for me, if i had a husband&#xD;
he'd lnam his plaice very-quick or i'd snake him out o' the&#xD;
house. -i belong to the smith family and they are a set&#xD;
of females that always stood up for their own sect. So i&#xD;
hope you'll jist put this into yure paper to teach men how&#xD;
they'd ought not to take advantidge of us poor weak win-&#xD;

Gubbernor Guss, and wid Lizzy Jumbo whowas brot up&#xD;
in de family oh a white gemman; and dat little niggar in&#xD;

to do wid dem niggars down in Ann 'treeet, 'cept Sophy&#xD;

Dis text is divided into sebenteen dewisions. De first&#xD;
diwision is a man, the second diwision isr- his company,&#xD;
and do todder dewision is what he keeps. De odder do-&#xD;
wisions is to tedious to mention, and some ob dem ain't&#xD;
mentioned at all.&#xD;
Now de fst dewision is de ticklar subject in de fust&#xD;
place I'm gwoine to slainn to you how de keepin' oh&#xD;
company wid de lower class am different from keeping'&#xD;
company wid de higher class. De keepin' ob company&#xD;
wie de higher class am de way to get into 'spectable com-&#xD;
pany, and ebery body say 'whew!t dat popylation ob color&#xD;
'long to de higher class oh society." Dis is de tickler&#xD;
difference ob de two classes. A niggar dat aspectt to 'long&#xD;
to de spectable class ob society muss wear long-tail coat,&#xD;
white tockin and boot. Dose is de di1erent d wisions ob&#xD;
de higher and de lower class ob society. Your 'spcted&#xD;
preacher will leaf it to white fokes, and ey wil  ou&#xD;
dat a niggar dat keeps herself respectful aud comb ou&#xD;

pomatum on he head, is more 'spectable dan a niggar dat&#xD;
goes round de docks and leans up agin a lasses hoxit till&#xD;
he get his trowsis full ob lasses.&#xD;
De 'spectable class don't eat de same ting as de lower,&#xD;
class. De lower class when dey go . into de sullar, call&#xD;
fqr lobster claw, but de'spectable class buy whole lobster&#xD;
at once. De'spected class hab cracker in dar clam soop,&#xD;
wid pepperand call for a piece ob jie and spread dar&#xD;
handkercher in dar lap when dey eat dar vittles to keep&#xD;
deg grease from smiling dar trowsis. Dis is de difference-&#xD;
between de lower class and de higher class ob de poppy-&#xD;
lation ob color.&#xD;
De second diwision ob de subjeck is de company.-&#xD;
Company is divided.into two partsde man company and&#xD;
de woman company-de male, and de female-de fair&#xD;
sect and de unfair sect. De fair sect is split into two&#xD;
part agin. De mulatto fair sect and de dark complected&#xD;
fair sect. De mullatto sect think darself more 'spectable&#xD;
den de dark-plected. Dat shows de pride ob dese critter,&#xD;
and pride is agin dar religions. Dey hab no rite to tink&#xD;
darself better dan odder population ob color, bekase it&#xD;
am false. Do -'spectable part is eggzackly de color ob&#xD;
your 'spected preacher. Your 'spected preacher is de&#xD;
color ob dat stove-nydder black nor yaller, but a kind&#xD;
ob brown which is is de color ob de bible. You see dat&#xD;
do kivers ob de bible is brown: well dat is de color ob&#xD;
your 'spected preacher  Darfore -dem iiggars ob dis&#xD;
color am de most 'spectable part of the poppylation ob&#xD;
color. If yo keep company wid dis color, ebery body&#xD;
will-'tink yon a 'spectable class ob niggar.&#xD;
. De fair sect company is sometimes kepp by way ob&#xD;
courti'g; Youmuss be berry 'ticklar to keep 'spectable&#xD;

make him as happy as a fried clam if he will marry&#xD;
her.&#xD;
Your 'spected preacher hab a pare ob white-top boot to&#xD;
sell to anybody dat wants to buy them, and dose. boots&#xD;
am for dem dat wants .to belong to de higher class, price&#xD;
two shilling apiece for de boots. Half a dollar for boff.&#xD;
,Black Pete ob Cat Alley hab jest received a lot ob&#xD;
second-hand tooth-brushes which he will sell cheap to de&#xD;
trade. You must always clean your teef if you want to&#xD;
belong to higher class, and you better buy one ob dese&#xD;
brushes.&#xD;
Now we shall 'prove upon de 'hole. Your 'spected&#xD;

that he couldn't say another word; for ant is grate on an&#xD;
argument. Arter he went away, the dockter cum up him-&#xD;
self, and tauked most butiful to her about it. He telled&#xD;
her about old Missus Ring that had a tooth pulled, and&#xD;
she held up her mouth and let him put in the pinchers&#xD;
without saying a single word till it was cleen out of her&#xD;
head.&#xD;
The dockter coaxed and coaxed, and they tauked over&#xD;
all the news in, the place, bekase the docktor thort he&#xD;
could git her to hav' it pulled if he telled her allthe news,&#xD;
and he gits 25 cents for every tooth that is pulled out:&#xD;
but whenever he showed his thing, with its terrible head&#xD;
to it, she wouldn't let him put it in, but she squeezed her&#xD;
lips together,'and telled him it would be the deth of her.&#xD;
At last he went off without pulling it out: but i can re-&#xD;
member most of the news that he yelled ant, bekase i was&#xD;
in the room all the time.&#xD;
He sed that Jeemes Brown and Seraphina Grissle was&#xD;

about it by Sarah Prestin, the old made. I spouse you've&#xD;
all cheered that.Sarah sed it wooddend nevver be a match,&#xD;
bekase Saraphina couldn't endure inions, and Jeemes was&#xD;
horrid fond of 'em. But the docktor sez they will sartin-&#xD;
lybe marred, bekase he seed Seraphina mending Jeemes's&#xD;
pantalons.&#xD;
,besides that, the dockter telled us about Jim Jewel and&#xD;

Then the doctor opened the dore and went in, for fewer&#xD;

Then he teller us about old Joe Dickson hoo doant ex-&#xD;

The docktor telled us abut Maria Goose, the old made,&#xD;

she telled him she couldn't do much longer without a man,&#xD;

Arter the docktor was gone, i put on my bunnit and&#xD;
went up to see Sally Lewis hoo is acquainted with Dump,&#xD;

Sally stared at me as if i wos a gost or a Swedenborg-&#xD;

no lusion to icester bay; but it 'ply dat it is not only a&#xD;
icester, but more dan one icester., I 'splain him fer you,&#xD;
Spose Peter Widgeon 'tand up in dis pulpit 'long side ob&#xD;
your 'spected preacher, den dar is more dan one man in&#xD;

De second 'diwission ob our text am de word 'oysters'&#xD;

ing, and de second icesters am spiritual. Dar is a differ-&#xD;
ence 'tween de fust kind and de spiritual kind. De spirit.&#xD;
ual icester means de word dat is preached-by your 'spect-&#xD;

and swall 'em down widhout winking. Dat is de way&#xD;
de word should be received. It should be swallowed-&#xD;

i thort i shood hav' busted for sartain.&#xD;
Tother gal that's arter me is named Deliverance Grime.&#xD;
She lives away up by thee Skunk Pond,. and she's rather&#xD;
an old gal. Mother wants me to marry her, bekase she&#xD;
sais that Deliverance will be like a muther to me, and&#xD;
wood mend my close and taik kee~r of me ; but she has a&#xD;
long knows, and thee other day when she undertook to&#xD;
kiss me, she stuck it into my mouth which -maid me so&#xD;
mad i was a good mind to hav' bit it.&#xD;
Her farther and mother was down to our house tother&#xD;
day and they had a long talk with the old fokes jest as&#xD;
if I was engaged to be married-to Deliverance. They'ar&#xD;

maid a fuss, and as sune as she had to cry for sumthing,&#xD;
she left off crying for nothing.&#xD;
So when Deliverance put up her handkercher, i-begun&#xD;
to whistle as loud as i could. Then she stopped crying&#xD;
bekase it was of no use; and-when she pulled away her&#xD;
handkercher, i seed that there want a single teer on her&#xD;
face-it was all purtence, like that. infernul niggar that&#xD;
sold us a pig last winter, 'and cum back and stold it the&#xD;
same nite. i was so mad i was a good mint to hav' cotch&#xD;
her by the throte and choked her out of the room. Then&#xD;
she lookt at me agin, and when she seed i didn't speek, she&#xD;
axed me if i didn't no thatfather and muther wanted ewe&#xD;
should be united in the bondage of weedlocks. i telled&#xD;
her i didn't want nothin' at all to -do with her, and that i&#xD;
wouldent 'marry her for her wate in sollid goold. Then&#xD;
she axed what i noed agin her carakter, that i wooddent&#xD;
hav'her. i telled her crakter was neither hear nor their,&#xD;
that i wooddent hav her if it was nothin' only her long&#xD;
knows. She sed her knows was just 'as God maid it.&#xD;
i tefied her that so was the old sow jest as God maid her;&#xD;
but i cooddent think of having her for awl that. That&#xD;
stumpt her, and she jumpt up ynd went out of the room,&#xD;
and sed she would tell, mother how i had suitedd her, and&#xD;
she would haverevenge for it.&#xD;
Jest as she was going out -of the room, Johanna Blue&#xD;
cum dancing in and met her in the dore. Then you'&#xD;
ought to hav' seen what a time there was. It was like&#xD;
tue mad cats tied up together in a bag. In the fust&#xD;
plaice, they both lookt rite at each other as red as a live&#xD;

and thee fur flew like a snow storm. They called each&#xD;

she told him that she new it was her duty to forward himd&#xD;
and axed him if he wasn't sorry for what he had done and&#xD;
for bein' a gay d-seaver. Then he up'd and telled her he&#xD;

about it that she laid her head - on his boozum and wept&#xD;
aloud. Then i spose that he begun to repent of his bad&#xD;
conduct, for he telled her that he never intended to hurt&#xD;

Then Mebitable telled him she would forgiv' him  be-&#xD;
kase it was her duty to forgiv' them that injures us, and&#xD;
she took hold of his hand and laid it on her boozun and be&#xD;
sez she did it to show him that she had forgiv him in her&#xD;
hart. But he wouldn't confess that he had d-seeved her.&#xD;
So she got up off the stump that she was settin on, and&#xD;
she telled him that he had very handsome eyes and then&#xD;
she put her arms around his neck and kissed him, and sais&#xD;
she--' Now Silass, i hav' fulfilled the scriptur and i hav&#xD;

to sedoose my virgin' hb t!'&#xD;
So she sez that he odded to her, and you no that was&#xD;
as much. as to say yes, and so it was his prom ass of mar-&#xD;
ridge. So she went rite of to the town clerk to get pub-&#xD;
lished, and he went down to Sighlass's fokes to ax 'em&#xD;
about it, and don't you think that this good-for-nothin'&#xD;
Sighlass denied the hull thing and sed he had never prom&#xD;
ised-to hav' her!&#xD;
So then poor Mehitable went into all the nabors and&#xD;
&#xD;
BY DEACON SNOWBALL AND DIEDRICH LAGER-BLATTER. 69&#xD;
told how her virgin hart had been sedoosed. And she&#xD;
went down to the squire and teelled him and wanted him&#xD;
to taik up Sighlass and sew him, for she can prove that&#xD;
he had been veerry attentiv' to her, and old Missus'Minton&#xD;
can taik her oath that she seed him taik the him-book&#xD;
from Mehitable in church, and saw him and Mehitable&#xD;
whisper together : and then old Zechariah White can swear&#xD;
that he seed 'em goin' to the woods together and that she&#xD;
leaned on Sighiass's arm.&#xD;
There never was sich a dredful case of seduction none&#xD;

YANKEE LETTER.&#xD;
Farther and me went down to town about a month ago.&#xD;
We took Temperance with us to see the wonders of the&#xD;
town. We rid down in the waggin with old sorrill. When&#xD;
e got down to Charlestown, we required the best house&#xD;
to ptrup in. So thay telled us the bunker-hill tavern was&#xD;
the mst 'spectable, and we went and put up their. You&#xD;
ought to hav'seed how we lived their. We had the vittles&#xD;
got all reddy for us, and sot on the table before we was&#xD;
called in, and their was noosepaper their in the bar-room&#xD;
for foks to ride. It was all dredful fine. And their was&#xD;
a legslatur mian that put up their, and that was dredful&#xD;
to hink on, for we was awful afeared of him. He use to&#xD;
stand up by the- stove and hold his cote-tales under his&#xD;
arms and then he had spechtecls on, and farther and me&#xD;
didn't dast to speek to him.,&#xD;
Temperance seed him cum into the eating-room and take&#xD;
a cheer and set down to table, and when i tolled her that&#xD;
he was a legislature man, she said he lookt like Sir Will-&#xD;
iam Walliss and Thawdeus of Wassaw. She sed she&#xD;
wondered if he was married, and so father axed the land-&#xD;
lord. and he sed the man had a wife and ten children.&#xD;
Then Temperanee said she would retire into obscurity and&#xD;
bemoan her sad fate like Saffo, and queen Didoes. She&#xD;
sod she wished that Mary Davenport was their to rite a&#xD;
peaee of poetness about his noble deeds.&#xD;

carry hum fora eurosiy, Arter that we went across a&#xD;
great long floor that;was bileoveihe watery and then we&#xD;
got into the master sitty of Bostown. Their was a hull&#xD;
passle of peeople and places wherth they sold jingerbread.&#xD;
Their was hosses and carts, and at last we found a Ock--&#xD;
tion. This was a plaice where they had all kinds of things&#xD;
to sell, you. sing out and tell how much yof will give for&#xD;
'em, and him that sings out the loudest has the trade and&#xD;
can carry it off arter it is paid for. So farther and me&#xD;
went up and lookt at 'em and we seed 'em sell the most&#xD;
butiful things- so cheep that it was a wonder.&#xD;
There was a elegant watch that lo kt as if it was made&#xD;
of goold and it was sold for seven dollars, and thenteir&#xD;
was a brast-pin that was sold for forty centsso farther&#xD;
and i telled the ocktion man that it was a hame to sell&#xD;
things so cheep, it was a 'bominable waist of property I&#xD;
Temperance was with us, and she seed the ocktion man&#xD;
trying to sell a beautiful pare of snuffers that lookt like&#xD;
silver, 'and she tolled farther and me to sing out the bids&#xD;
on it.,So farther sung out 1w'enty-five cents. Then i sing&#xD;
out thirty cents and then the ocktion man hollered---'going'&#xD;
going!' and then farther hollered out fofty cents-then&#xD;
the ocktion man kept saying, 'going, going'-and then&#xD;
Temperance hollered out fifty, cents. So .he sold it to us&#xD;
for fifty cents, and Temperance was so afeared that sum-&#xD;
boddy else would get it away, that she run in amongst&#xD;
the men and grabbled holt on it and paid .the munny out&#xD;
of her own pocket. Then they lifted up a pare of trow-&#xD;
sers to sell and the ooktion man sed they was worth -7&#xD;
dollars every cent of it,. so i hollered out the bid and sez&#xD;
seven dollars as ,loud as i could holler, but the ocktion&#xD;
man kept sayin' 'going I going!' so farther was afeared&#xD;
we shouldn't get the trowsers and he hollered out eight&#xD;

dollar. So artel' a while they wos sold to us for eight&#xD;
dollars, and we bmawt a number more thing bekase they&#xD;
sold 'em so. cheap.&#xD;
We took all our things and carried 'em over to the&#xD;
bunker hill tavern, and farther showed 'em all to the legis-&#xD;
latr dan, and he didn't say nothin' but there was a man&#xD;
in their hoowantedt6purtend that the thigs want worth&#xD;
nothing' So we moed he was tfyi g to git the things sold&#xD;
to him, for father is very sharp and he noes. when fokes&#xD;
is trying to taik him inn. So we went home with our ock-&#xD;
tion things and Temperance went all about the naborbude&#xD;
to shoe 'em her things and she telled 'em how they went-&#xD;
to work to git things at the ocktion. The minister's wife&#xD;
cum down to our house to look at the things that Temper-&#xD;
ance had bawt at the ocktion and their was grate doing&#xD;
in dur house.&#xD;
Jim -later um down to see the things and so he con-&#xD;
cuded to set p with Temperance seeing that she had&#xD;
a nich lot of flue things, but she 'maid him a present of a&#xD;
beatiful bag that she had bawt at ocktion, and so he&#xD;

You hab heered ob some dat 'hab stubble for a founda-&#xD;

subjeck is not about de foundation, but de todder 'eend.&#xD;
Straw is used for de head: Straw bed am used to sleep&#xD;

you can see for yourself as she sets dar under de gallery&#xD;

de human body am diwided into two hands, and dem&#xD;

de two strings, de two beaux, de lining, de thread to sow&#xD;

De second diwision out o de seventeen divisions am&#xD;
de lady herself. I tink she was a lady ob color, and dese&#xD;
am de raisins. In de fast place do smell ob de lady tract&#xD;

You augt to hav heered him sware t a hen the other day.&#xD;
I stood behind the fence and lookt at him till everything&#xD;
turned dark be4 my ize. He was up at razing tother day&#xD;
in Acton. Jop Hoxie was bilding a nue barn; and when&#xD;
he was up their, he torked so that every one had to stand&#xD;

flung it agin a fence and ript and swored and se de had&#xD;
licked more men than anybody else on the ground.  0!&#xD;
you awt to here him tock!&#xD;

bokker goose and, it fell slap on the stove, and it bubbled&#xD;
and sissed, and the shewmakers all jumpt rite' up, for it&#xD;
steered them so that they thort a airthquake was broken&#xD;

Then when they heered his voyce, it steered 'em wuss&#xD;
than ever, andthey all huddled up in one kornor of the&#xD;
shop and lookt at him jest as. cats looks at a dog when&#xD;
they want a chanse to run and git off.'&#xD;
Then he took out a short pipe and sits - down on the&#xD;

sot by the winder so that he cood jump out if this terrible&#xD;

Bounce the youngest s.kewmaker, seed that his cloke was&#xD;

Y   _age that peter cum to our house last fall to help&#xD;
pickp"en on haffs, Well he use to work till very late,&#xD;
as the day was kider short, and it was dark be4 he got&#xD;
hum. When he got hum, we was all dun supper, and so&#xD;
'Peter would go into the kitchen and-ind nobody-their but&#xD;
sister temperance, and she was a cooking of his suRer.&#xD;
Arter she got it on the table, and it was pudding and&#xD;
milk, then she wouldgo into the best room to' the closet&#xD;
andt brig out a bit of presarved quince and put it on a'&#xD;
plate b.hiss bowl, all nice as satything. .,Then he seed&#xD;
that she was tender-hearted like, and.had a feeling for a&#xD;
feller ,a'one wood say. So he wood; look up at her as he&#xD;
was     iat  andwood nod his head, which was as much as&#xD;
toBay thnkee, you noe.&#xD;
Arter a while, Temperance got so that when she pui&#xD;
on4he bit.e"uince on the table,.she would kinder let her&#xD;
frock rub agin his elbow, and it felt so kinder soft and&#xD;
bq ot himthat it took away all his apatight, and&#xD;
mot hriIed h that bekase 'it saved vittles. Then Tem-&#xD;
pepace got to'gtoppin' in the kitchen till he was, dum&#xD;

eatin'. She sot up in the corner- at first and. wood look&#xD;
on, to see if he wanted anything.  He dassat say much&#xD;
to her at fust: but arter a while, he got so that he wood&#xD;
tell her it was a fine day andethat he thort there wood be&#xD;
rain,and then she wood say- "' i hope not, Mr. Peter -;for,&#xD;
if there was to be rain, it wood be;bad for you when you&#xD;
are out of doors a picki g off the apples.'&#xD;
Then he noed ' she had a feelin' for a' feller ; and he&#xD;
seed that she had a mind of her pwn, and she noed how&#xD;
to 'spress it proper, for she had good learning,  ugh I&#xD;
say it myself. Then arter-a while, she got to 'setting up&#xD;
closer to him, so that at, last,,she- would eat her supper&#xD;
when he eat 'his'n.' So .when they sot, down to table to-&#xD;
gether, she wood say--' Mr. Peter, wo ' you have ano-&#xD;
ther slice of bread-Mr. Peter,. won't y  have another&#xD;
slice of, bread-Mr. Peter, i'm afeard that nilk ain{arm&#xD;
enuff for you,' and all that air sort of thing, and then he&#xD;
would lay down his spoon and look as ,if he was balan-&#xD;
cing himself on a rale, and was afeered of tumbling off.&#xD;
When she spoke ,to him, he would look up like a duck&#xD;
when he hears it thunder.&#xD;
So sister Temperance at last put away the -big tabfe&#xD;
and sot out the little table for him' and then when they&#xD;
sot down to supper, they was close together you know,&#xD;
and one night when they sot eating, her knee touched agin&#xD;
his nee, and. he sed such a feelin eone over him that he&#xD;
thought 'he, should have died, and he couldn't eat nothing'&#xD;
at all arter that, So it got so at last that when the ap-&#xD;
ples was all picked, and' eter must home about his&#xD;
.other biziiness; that Temperance sez to him sezseh.-&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Peter, hope you wont forit'oroldfrinds.'&#xD;

when the' minister cum  down to our house, he had five&#xD;
big books-under' his arm, and as soon as he was interdu-&#xD;

Then the pedlar sez he-" Yes, yes you want some&#xD;
hominy for supper. 1 will answer you ;" and then the&#xD;
pedlar spread out his arms: and sez he:&#xD;
"Polly voo frang hee ,?"&#xD;
Then the minister looked in the dictionary a great&#xD;

means bitter ; and Pollmyand Mary is the same thing; so&#xD;
the fust word is bitter, but £Ican't tell the rests"&#xD;
So the pedlar seed that he had stumpt the minister,&#xD;
and he rubbed his hands,'and told wher he was brort up&#xD;

stresss de parpendicklars ob do debble, and de under one&#xD;
'spress do 'ticklars ob fat; darfore de fustpart is deiust&#xD;
diwision, and de second part is de second didission.&#xD;
Darfore your spected preacher will diwide doeword like&#xD;
a apple cut' in two haffs, and throw away de corg which is&#xD;
de third haff and wich is to tedous 'to mention; de fust&#xD;
diwission is de perpendicklars ob de debbil. Hinx fink is&#xD;
de speritual name for your 'spected preacher. - Whenebb&#xD;
ber de debble looks -at your 'spected preacher he winks,&#xD;
for de sight ob him "makes de debbIe's eyes sore.  He&#xD;
knaws dat your 'spected preacher is a sledgehammer t-&#xD;

he is tryin' to bild up among dis 'spectable flock ob color.&#xD;
He darfore hate de sight of your 'spected preacher--dar-&#xD;
fore de fust diwission ob de text presss de fact dat your&#xD;

Now de second diwission is de second part, and stresss&#xD;
de 'portant fack dat de fat begins to fry. Y  under'tan'&#xD;
,do meanin' ob dat. When Cesar Widgeon ies clama-in.&#xD;

in no fat, he no fry de clam; dar am warous kinds of de&#xD;
fat-dar is mutton fat, fat ob mutton, fat of beef, and&#xD;
fat ob lobster, wish is green, But dar is a spiritual fat.&#xD;

you must step over that step, and tht i must be. sum&#xD;

Theh i axed him if he was Cesar'Widgeon; and he sed&#xD;

He was a short thick niggar'and:haff his hare was gray&#xD;
and haff was black and it curled up like wool. He had a&#xD;
kupple of little tables their. and'a long bench; a big su-&#xD;
gar-box put on two logs of wood served as his bar--so i&#xD;
treeted the other niggar to his root beer, and took a big&#xD;
chunk of gingerbred for myself. So when Cesar Widgeon&#xD;
seed that i had money, he was wunderful good.  Then i&#xD;
axed him where deking Snowball lived, and he sed he ex-&#xD;
pected the deking Snowball and sed he was more talked&#xD;
about than any other minister in the hull town.. Pretty&#xD;
soon, i heered a kind of bustle at the- sullar dore, and i&#xD;
seed a little\short niggar cum down, with 3=or 4 wimjmin&#xD;

geon, but he wos about the kuller of a chesnut: He had&#xD;
ruffles in his boozum, and had on small close and nee buc-&#xD;
kles, and a long pointed cote that cum away down to his&#xD;

De language ob de text is berry 'splicit. It tell you&#xD;
dat so    say de debble is dead. Dead is divided into&#xD;
two prts.     f st part is when you are dead for sartin&#xD;
and ed:.todder part is wen you make blieve dat you are&#xD;
dead,    keep one eye open all de time. Your 'spected&#xD;

an d  ake bieve dead when you held a candle to,his nose,&#xD;
fofgfat you kill him true enough. Bed bug will do&#xD;
d same ting . Praps de debble do dis way sometimes as&#xD;
he is de fadder of lies; and praps dat de text,'lude to dat&#xD;
fat,   inform hissef, into a, angel ob light, and make&#xD;
believe dathe was dead. If he portend to be dead in de&#xD;
presee of your'spected preacher he would tread on de&#xD;

Butyour    eeted preacher hab 'ticelar reason to blieve&#xD;
da   debbl is not dead yet. In de fust place, dar is&#xD;

tosicated by de debble.- De same was de case when&#xD;
Rachel Jumbo 'fuse to mend your 'spected preacher's&#xD;

D second part ob de text tell you dat de debble is&#xD;
buried in de harbor. Praps he might hab been shut up&#xD;
dar lass winter till dey cut a'big hole in de ice and den&#xD;
he creep out again.&#xD;
Todder diwision tell you dat he 'hab come to life and&#xD;
turned into a barber. If dat be de case, I 'wise you to&#xD;
be, berry keerful who shave you, bekase he may put&#xD;
brimstone in de lather. If you should happen to get&#xD;
shaved by de debble in de shape ob a barber, you will&#xD;
get someting wuss dan de Jackson scratches. Praps he&#xD;
put lime on your head and make you blieve it is powder,&#xD;
and take off all de wool, as a- gemman of color dat your&#xD;
preacher was acquainted wid once did.. He shave you&#xD;
wid a dull razor and scrape all de brack skin oft youth face&#xD;

Now I'm gwoine to 'prove upon de 'hole. When de&#xD;

Tue or three dais arter Peter was gone, their, was an-&#xD;

she telled him that she noed all tbat be4, and that he nee-&#xD;
dent tell her nothin' about the day.  But he spunked up,&#xD;

Then the fellers all gut kinder steered about Abagal,&#xD;

Fust is bubble., A bubble is made of water and some-&#xD;
times he am made ob sorneting else.' A bubble 'tand on&#xD;
top of de water like a-little house wid a round top. Now&#xD;
dar is two bubbles in de text; de fast bubble is bubble,&#xD;
and de todder is bubble too-and so dat makes two bub-&#xD;
bles.&#xD;
Dese two am toil and trouble, and dat 'lude to making&#xD;
'lasses candy. Rachel Mones is 'ployed in de business,&#xD;
and she find it all toil and trouble. In de fast place, she&#xD;
hab to giv de boys 'stibks to go down to de wharf and get&#xD;
de Masses out ob de hoxit dar. They bring it home, and&#xD;
den she hab to pay dem and bile urn. She put de 'lasses&#xD;
into de dust=pan and set urn on de fire, den she 'bliged to&#xD;
stir hirt till he bile up, ' and deli he bile up agii. She den&#xD;
is 'bliged to keep him from filing over, and dat is bubble&#xD;
'corditi' to de text.&#xD;
In biling dclar soup dar is also bubble, toil and trouble,&#xD;
fust you hav' to put on de water to bile;den you peel de&#xD;
'taters and put him into slice, den you put in de clam an'&#xD;
bile dem all wid red pepper. All dis 'quire toil and trou-&#xD;
ble; and you tink dat Cesar can afford to trust you for all&#xD;
dem ting, and bit ob lobster' into de bargain. It is toil&#xD;
and trouble to make clam soup and he 'spect to get pay&#xD;
for him-dat is de fourf division ob de text.&#xD;
In de next place, your 'spected preacher hab, grate toil&#xD;
and trouble to 'splode de bubbles ob his text and gib you&#xD;
saxifaction in do 'spounding of de word.  He 'specks to&#xD;
be paid for all dis toil and ti-ouble, and dat you put M-&#xD;
ey in de hat.&#xD;
Fiffly is de trouble ob tryii' to wsh a colored geinan&#xD;
white. To 'form dig operation, you' hab to 'use gate deal&#xD;
ob soap and scrubbin'-brush.  You find it i  berry hard&#xD;
work.. Berry few niggars hab ben washed white. Wool&#xD;

Then muther sot down the t-pot, and lookt rite at her,&#xD;
and held up both her hands and sez she-" mercy on me!&#xD;
what has happened now, and what is it that is to pay,&#xD;
sure enuff?"&#xD;
Then we left off etein' to see what was the matter.&#xD;
Then Abagill pulled oph her bunnet and lade on the arm&#xD;
cheer, and she sot up close to mother and sez she--" i&#xD;
thort it was bad enuff when Lucy Brown got into a scrape&#xD;
with that Aldritch feller; but there's sumthing wuss than&#xD;
that now!"&#xD;
" Law suz-a-daisy!' sez mother-'is it possible that this&#xD;
miller book, has cum true, and we're all goin' to be burnt&#xD;
up?'&#xD;
"No, it's sumthin' wuss than that!"said Abagill, "it is&#xD;
a which!"&#xD;
"A what?" sez mother.&#xD;
"A which!" sez she.&#xD;
"Well, now, did you ever?" sez mother, "and a dred-&#xD;
ful thing is this which i'll be bound to say,"-sez mother,&#xD;
"what is a which like?"&#xD;
"Why it's that old Dinah Spooner," sez Abigail, " and&#xD;
a horrid thing it is.' It's a woman that has a sperritt in&#xD;
side of her."&#xD;
"A woman with a sperritt inside of her," sez mother.&#xD;
"0 dredful! and what does this sperritt do there? Is&#xD;
there no weigh to git it out?"&#xD;
"Yes, they say theirs a weigh," sez Abigall-" if you&#xD;
draw out six ounces, of her blood and hay' it all biled&#xD;
away in a skillet, it will kill the evil one and her too."&#xD;
Then Abigall went on to tell about the which, and how .&#xD;
their was noises maid, and how the lites burnt blew, and&#xD;
a gray cat was seen settin' in her winder every day at&#xD;
21 o'clock. Then he telled how Mr. Richardson's chil-&#xD;
dren had been bewitched by her and had red pimples&#xD;
broke out all over there face and hands. The doctor sed&#xD;
&#xD;
BY DEACON SNOWBALL AND DIEDRICH LAGERBLATTER. Igg&#xD;
they was poisoned by goin' into the swamp, but Abagill&#xD;
sez she don't think it is pison at all. She thinks they are&#xD;
bewitched by this old missus Spooner, 'specially when the&#xD;
cat was see, tother day, playin' with won of Mistur Rich-&#xD;
ardson's children.&#xD;
Soon as ever- Abagill telled us this, we wos all of a&#xD;
trimble for fear of bein' bewitched, and sister Dorothy sed&#xD;
she began to feel strange, and so mother and Abagill&#xD;
looked over her face and neck, and true enuff, they found&#xD;
a pimpal jest under her ear. Then Abagill held up both&#xD;
hands and sed that the which aught to be shot rite off,&#xD;
for she didn't bleve-but what the sperrit that wos in her&#xD;
had ben bewitched, and then sister busted rite out a cry-&#xD;
ing, and mother and Abagill axed her what aled her, and&#xD;
she sed that tother day, when she was goin' cross lots,&#xD;
there was a cat that run down into the holler amungst&#xD;
the bushes and she seed her as plane as day.&#xD;
Then we wos all skeered to deth,. for sister had seed a&#xD;
cat and had got a pimpal under her ear, and we noed she,&#xD;
wos bewitched sure enuff. So farther put on his hat and&#xD;
cote and sot out to go rite up to the minister and ax him&#xD;
to cum down to the house. Mother begged him not to&#xD;
venture his life by goin' out of doors when there wosa&#xD;
which in the villidge;.but he sed it was his duty and&#xD;
when anything wos his duty he won't afeered of nor-&#xD;
thing. So he went up and brought down the minister.&#xD;
The minister heered what Abagill and mother sed, and&#xD;
then he lookt at the pimpel under sister's ear and axed&#xD;
her how long it had ben their, and she couldn't tell; but&#xD;
she told about the cat that she seen when she wos cross-&#xD;
ing the lot.&#xD;
The minister lookt very serious, and arter a wile, he&#xD;
sed he dien't bleeve that Missus Spooner wos a which,&#xD;
but he told sister it ought to be a warning to her,and&#xD;
teech her to consider her latter end.&#xD;

Then the minister went hum agin, and Abagill, shQ sed&#xD;
that the doctor' and the minister had laring' and sot up&#xD;
upon it; but she noed that Missus Spooner wos a which,&#xD;
for she had bewitched Mistur Richardson's children.&#xD;
We all concluded to set up that nite and watch, and&#xD;
we called in tue neighbors to set up with us, and won on&#xD;
'om was Mister Pussy, the sope biler, and he sed that&#xD;
their ought to be a town meeting' called to see about it,&#xD;
aid he sed that. he felt a kinder strange himself ever&#xD;
sense he had heered about the which, and he bleeved he&#xD;
seed a cat' a week be4. Then he telled a most beautiful&#xD;
story about a woman away up to the country wher he&#xD;
lived when he was a 'prentiss, and how she wos bewitch-&#xD;
ed and every time she saw a cat, she sed her prayers till&#xD;
it cured her.&#xD;
Nit day, we got a few foes to go over to Missus&#xD;
Spooner's with us, and we peaked'at her while she was&#xD;
washing' oe her apurn, and every one sed she acted pro-&#xD;
per strange,,and she kepp wipin her forrid with a hand-&#xD;
kercher, though there wasn't a drop of aw ett to be seen&#xD;
on it. We dasent speek to her, but we lookt at her as&#xD;
much as hafflan'our, and farther sezthat sumthing aught&#xD;
t be dun about it, and if she has got a sperrit, it ought&#xD;
to be perjured to cum out of her.&#xD;

Arter a wile, this capting asked us what we- wanted&#xD;

they wood pay him any munny to git a chance to ride,&#xD;
He telled us that he was goin' down to Bangyor and wood&#xD;
ax us a dollar a peace to ride there, and another dollar&#xD;
to ride back, and we should be obleeged to stay all night&#xD;
in Bang-yor.&#xD;
Farther telled him that he wood hay' no sectionss to&#xD;
stay all night, if his wife new he was out; but she hadn't&#xD;
sposed he wood stay all nite and she mite be jellus. Then&#xD;
the capting sed we might do what we was a mind for to&#xD;

rite; and uncle Obed sed he sposed that the capting was&#xD;
riting to farthers wife to tell her that he wood be gone all&#xD;

So we stade in the bote, and the fust we noed, we heer-&#xD;
ed something rdre like a pesky grate tickkittle a biting,&#xD;

the nose of a blacksmith's bellusses and the smoke and&#xD;
steem was goin' out on it like all natur, and it went whiz&#xD;
whur-r----.-r-r, and maid all sorts o' noises. Then we&#xD;
see a hull passle of people hurryin' into the steam boat&#xD;
and they cum with ban-boxes and trunks, and- then, in a&#xD;
minnit, the bote begun to ride, and the ropes was ontied&#xD;
from there bigposts, and a little inn, gallus begun to go&#xD;
up and down, and there was a dredful hissing- and smok-&#xD;
ing, and the steemboat rid out into the seize where&#xD;
the water was deep and the waves lookt as white as a&#xD;
guce.&#xD;
There was tue wheels to the bote, and .they kept a&#xD;
turnin' round and maid a heap of dust in the water,- Far-&#xD;
