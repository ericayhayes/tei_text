twenty years of age, tall, well formed&#xD;

nificence and style of her appearance.&#xD;
She was nervous and over anxious, ap-&#xD;
parently reluctant to meet the glances&#xD;

"If the lady desires rest," observed&#xD;
Walter Devins, as he approached the&#xD;

Walter Devins was ever an unwelcome&#xD;

Seth, the publican, cursed him most&#xD;
heartily for hi.i interference whereby&#xD;
the hostelry,patronized by all the presi-&#xD;
dents lost the perspective emolument to&#xD;
be derived from a town lady and her'&#xD;
carriage suite. Lamentation however&#xD;
was futile and anger thoroughly useless,&#xD;

despised threats and absolutely rejoiced&#xD;
in a good old fashioned square fight.&#xD;

"Bomd, both- ways,":quoth :olornon;&#xD;
"I dO'understandyou."&#xD;
"Wiser heads than, yours have been,&#xD;
puzzled to make out my abode," coollyt&#xD;
remarked the -strolling bootmender, as,&#xD;
he deposited his baskets containing' his&#xD;
working implements on the piazza,t"for&#xD;
gentlemen of my peculiar turn of thind&#xD;
wears outalmost as many shoes as they&#xD;
can coaiveniently repair. -A travelling&#xD;
cobbler is a man of a particular breed,&#xD;
and, like yno one else.  ie's. got no&#xD;
country, no house, no home. He break-&#xD;
fasts in a village, that is when he break-&#xD;
fasts; he dines in a town, that 'is when&#xD;
he dines, and ,leeps in a city, that is&#xD;
when he sleeps."&#xD;
"Ho's the , andering lew, is he 7" in-&#xD;
quired the hoyden Mary Jane.&#xD;
"With a basket too much and a dol-&#xD;
lar bill too little," responded the cob-&#xD;
bIer, casting a professional eye upep&#xD;
the lady's boots.,&#xD;
"Poor fellow," said Mary ,iane, "ho&#xD;
can't be l appy without a single dollar."&#xD;
"Yes I canbut not very," replied the&#xD;
peripatetic; philosopher gaily, some-&#xD;
time I have a dollar, and then again I&#xD;
haven't, but betwixt you and I, it al-&#xD;
ways turns out the same thing in the.&#xD;
end."&#xD;
"fio v's that n learned traveller"&#xD;
remarked the' laly.&#xD;
"Whel Ihave 'a dollar, I spend-it in&#xD;
treat ibg 'my industry," rejoined the&#xD;
cobbler,"an'd when I haven't any I work&#xD;
so as to have it -to treat my, , industry&#xD;
with. Some Ipeople say that drink&#xD;
makes a man idle,-but if it wasut for&#xD;
drink Pa sure aI'd never work, that is&#xD;
the short and'long of the matter."&#xD;
"Bravo!"- shouted the crowd, charmed&#xD;
with the argumelht; "pray, my jolly fel-&#xD;
low, what may be your name ?"&#xD;
"Christopher Last," returned the&#xD;
bootmaker good 'humoredly, "the lasts&#xD;
of the lasts, and ever too late in being&#xD;
the last."'&#xD;
"And never last at a drink," suggest,&#xD;
ed Solomon Sickle.&#xD;
&#xD;
"All right, girls, Black 'Dicks' come !&#xD;
Let's have a dance if you say so."&#xD;
In this wise shouted 'Mr. Solomon&#xD;
Si!kle, somewhat elated by the drink&#xD;
he had swallowed, and still more so by&#xD;
the fact that Walter Devins had with-&#xD;
drawn from their society.&#xD;
"No time now, Sol," returned Mr.&#xD;
Turbot, the director of the revels, who&#xD;
assumed management of affairs, "call&#xD;
the girls, while I go and see after the&#xD;
vehicles. Hold on to the dark, Sol, we&#xD;
can't go wit hot music."&#xD;
Mr. Sickle performed his allotted task&#xD;
with comnnendable alacrity, and within&#xD;
afew moments tl)e guests of the Eagle'&#xD;
were assenlbled upon Ihe broad piazza&#xD;
running in front of that public building.&#xD;
"Boots to mend ! Half soles, heel taps,&#xD;
footed, mended and stitched !" '&#xD;
"What's that " " anxiously inquired&#xD;
the entire crowd, as upon their ears&#xD;
broke these words, delivered with a&#xD;
species -f jerking emI)hasis.&#xD;
"It's a travelling cobbler," remarked&#xD;
I Solomon, with a knowing leer; "where&#xD;
in the name did v ou come from my fine&#xD;
fellow ?"&#xD;
'Iome !" curtly responded the peri-&#xD;
patetic mennder of decayed boots.&#xD;
"All right,'' continued  Solomon,&#xD;
"where are you going to, my boy ?"&#xD;

"A Thousand thanks, mf hospitable&#xD;

tip it off with a dance of the same ma-&#xD;

"Try and come this way again,"&#xD;
(ulth the hoyden Mary Jantas leading&#xD;

"I'l try it, my flower of the wilder-&#xD;

hand with an affectation of polite gal-&#xD;

"Goodby old top, see you again!"&#xD;
shouted Solomon Sickle, as he set about&#xD;
arranging the order of the departure,&#xD;
much to the annoyance of the g:oows-&#xD;
man who vainly protested against this&#xD;
usurpation of privilege. "Now, then,"&#xD;
continued the farmer, "music in front,&#xD;
girls in the middle, married men to the&#xD;
rear."&#xD;
Having deposited Black Dick and his&#xD;
superanuated violin, which had fur--&#xD;
nished dancing music tQ the communi-&#xD;
ty of Ileauview during a monopoly of&#xD;
fifty years, .safely upon the box seat,&#xD;
Mr. Sickle assumed the reins with the&#xD;
air of a master whip. With an encoura-&#xD;
ging shout he started the well condition-&#xD;
ed team, and touched the off horse with&#xD;
a gentle flourish of the lash.&#xD;
'Goodby, cobbler!" shouted the ani-&#xD;
mated contents of the .ecluie in exuber-&#xD;
ance of glee, to which unanimous fare-&#xD;
well the strolling mechanic simply re-&#xD;
sponded by uttering his ianuiliar cry of&#xD;
"Boots to wend ! halt soles, heel taps,&#xD;

basket and made prepa atiois to pro-&#xD;
gress upon his ,journey. It must be&#xD;
confessed that the artisan resumed his&#xD;
tramp with more than ordinary reluct-&#xD;
ance, for the beautiful eyes and the fra-&#xD;
ternal words of MaryJane had made an&#xD;
impression on the traveller, which ,at-&#xD;
tached him to the scene of their in-&#xD;
promptu meeting, as an oasis in the&#xD;
desert of his vagrant life.&#xD;
Scarcely ad the wedding train die-&#xD;
appeared from the sight of the cobbler,&#xD;
watching its descent down the dusty&#xD;
hillside, than a strange gentleman,&#xD;
mounted upon a thorough bred steed,&#xD;
dashed to the-entrance door of the Ea-&#xD;
gle, near which the travelling bootma-&#xD;
ker lingered in seeming meditation on&#xD;
the mutability of mundane affairs.&#xD;
"Is this Ieauview ?" inquired the&#xD;
equestrian, the smoking sides of whose&#xD;
steed showed that he had ridden both&#xD;
long and fast.&#xD;
"I think so," responded Christopher&#xD;
Last, with a familiar nod.&#xD;
"Have you seen a lady pass this way ?"&#xD;
continued the horseman.&#xD;
"A lady," replied the cobbler musing-&#xD;
ly, "you had better believe I have.&#xD;
There is two dozen of them just gone&#xD;
up the road."&#xD;
"They're country folks," interposed&#xD;
the traveller rather testily.&#xD;
They're ladies, nevertheless," re-&#xD;
torted Mr. Last gravely.&#xD;
Undoubtedly," resumed the eques-&#xD;
trian, "but the one I speak of is a lady&#xD;
from the city-with an equipage and&#xD;
attendants I"&#xD;
"Then 1 havexft seen her," and the&#xD;
cobbler shook his head moodily; "be-&#xD;
side I don't belong to this part of the&#xD;
country, as I know of."&#xD;
The equestrian glanced around ner-&#xD;

which in his hands should accumulate&#xD;

As the parent, spoke, he placed in the I&#xD;
hands of the widow a packet of impor-&#xD;
tant documents, charging her to take&#xD;
the greatest care of the papers as sub-&#xD;
stantiations of his assertions.&#xD;
"You have no need, Mr. Vane," quoth&#xD;
the widow, as she placed the packet&#xD;
next to her bosom, "to distrust my lack&#xD;

papers will be guarded with a most&#xD;

"Henrietta, weep not," interposed&#xD;
Hubert Vane, as he viewed most sor-&#xD;

"Heaven be my judge that I am worthy&#xD;
of thy love, dearest of women."&#xD;
Mr. Vane would have spoken longer&#xD;
but the abrupt appearance of an aged&#xD;
domestic announced that the hour of&#xD;
the fugitive's departure was at hand.&#xD;
"Already," sobbed the lady, "and on-&#xD;
&#xD;
"Farewell, all that I love," adly&#xD;
murmured Hubert Vane, almost over-&#xD;
come with his emotions, "may prosperi-&#xD;

you have at least one consolation, you&#xD;
will breathe the same air as our blessed&#xD;
babe."&#xD;
"And yet you will be far away from&#xD;

her arms. "Farewell, Hubert, farewell&#xD;

its smiling face ! Why has heaven sent&#xD;
me this little cherub, upon whom a&#xD;
heart-torn mother can alone bestow the&#xD;
caresses of maternal affection in the&#xD;
shades of privacy. Alia! it is a punish-&#xD;

"Henrietta," murmured the father&#xD;
cheeringly, "be resigned to fate. Place&#xD;
confidence in the future, in the da-a&#xD;
of hope."&#xD;
"1 am a poor frail woman," mourn'&#xD;
fully and sorrowfully rejoined the af-&#xD;
flicted lady, "my cup of anguish is al-&#xD;
most filled to the brim. Oh, Mary, take&#xD;
precious care of our sweet one. Speak&#xD;
to her of her father and her mother,&#xD;
and how they parted with her."&#xD;
Mary Vernon simply intimated that&#xD;
the time for Hubert's leaving was fully&#xD;
at hand, and no moments were to be&#xD;
lost for his escape.&#xD;
"True, true," responded the unhappy&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
THE FIFTH AVENUE 'PAVEMENT.&#xD;
"Well, Jimn, what idid Montauk close&#xD;
at? or how goes 'Quaker City I"&#xD;
With these business-like words, an&#xD;
exquisitely dressed young man,:studded&#xD;
with diamonds and jewelry, accosted&#xD;
another, rather more plainly attired, as&#xD;
they encountered during a promenade&#xD;
on the pavement of the Fifth Avenue&#xD;
towards the close of an autumn day.&#xD;
"Why, my dear Van," returned the&#xD;
gentleman ad dressed, in a tone of fami-&#xD;
liarity corresponding to the manner of&#xD;
his approach, "to tell you the truth I've&#xD;
had a streak of luck. I struck oil-every-&#xD;
where. Greasy Bottom, which I bought&#xD;
at five, turned up a two hundred gallon&#xD;
only last Monday and sells to-day at&#xD;
one hundred and ten, while Bubble&#xD;
Hole, purchased on time, showed a&#xD;
five hundred gallon well, and therefore&#xD;
the stock has run almost out of sight."&#xD;
"That is luck !" exclaimed Mr. Cor-&#xD;
nelius Vanderip, one of the fast men&#xD;
about town, as he gazed admiringly up-&#xD;
on the person of the successful specula-&#xD;
tor, who rejoiced in the appellation of&#xD;
James Short, and had previously eked&#xD;
out a precarious existence as a street&#xD;
broker, "that is luck by all that is holy,&#xD;
wonderful luck! by jingo !"&#xD;
"Nothing of the kind," quoth the bro-&#xD;
ker in an off hand manner, "on the con-&#xD;
trary it's, genius, Van, pure genuine fi-&#xD;
nancial talent."&#xD;
"Then you have made a pile, Jim,"&#xD;
inquired Mr. Vanderip, ineffectually &amp;amp;n-&#xD;
eavoriung to ascertaiu %he sum total&#xD;
&#xD;
of profits on Greasy Bottom alon ,&#xD;
employing his digitals as multiplior$,&#xD;
"haven't you?"&#xD;
"I'm frank enough to.say that I am&#xD;
easy in my boots," rejoined the broker,&#xD;
with an air of triumph ashe rounded&#xD;
off his sentence with rhetorical flourish-&#xD;
es, "quite a plum, I tell you, and accep-&#xD;
table at that."&#xD;
"Possibly ten thousandor-so, all in&#xD;
a day or two, myo."&#xD;
"Ten thousand ." rejoined the broker&#xD;
with a smile of contempt at the under&#xD;
estimate of his adventure, "make it a&#xD;
hundred thousand and you mny touch&#xD;
something like the bottom of the "mark,&#xD;
Van."&#xD;
"One hundred thousand inside of two&#xD;
days!" ejaculated' Vanderip, institu-&#xD;
ting a mental comparison between their&#xD;
respective conditions, "that is wonder-&#xD;
ful ! But here comes Marcy, I wonder&#xD;
;how much he struck inihis venture up-&#xD;
on petroleum stocks ?"&#xD;
"You had better * ask him," observed&#xD;
the broker with a curl upon his lip.&#xD;
"D-n petroleum !" exclaimed the&#xD;
new comer with ill disguised vexation,&#xD;
as he wiped the perspiration from his&#xD;
forehead, "I'm broke ,flat all through&#xD;
that infernal scoundrel Stiggins and his&#xD;
bubble."&#xD;
"Broke Marcy," quoth Vanderip with&#xD;
a look of incredulity.&#xD;
"Everything gone," replied Marcy,&#xD;
with a sigh, "the balloon went up. Stig-&#xD;
g ins has sloped, and I'm played out for&#xD;
sure."&#xD;
"Didn't understand the thing," in-&#xD;
terposed the broker, jocosely, "there is&#xD;
never a rose without a thorn. You are&#xD;
like the certain good man who journey-&#xD;
ed, &amp;amp;c., You comprehend, Marcy I"&#xD;
The broker ctgekled amazingly and&#xD;
the enthusiastic Vanderip instantly ap-&#xD;
preciated the difference between an im-&#xD;
promptu millionaire and one who had&#xD;
beggared him in a venture for gain.&#xD;

made aware that I have been turned&#xD;

"Won't old Timpson assist you ? in-&#xD;
quired the broker sarcastically. "By&#xD;

True enough; as the group of [gentle-&#xD;
men were conversing, they were con-&#xD;
fronted by a couple of belles, who pro-&#xD;
menaded the pavement of the avenue,&#xD;

evidently desirous of ridding himself of&#xD;

with the maintenance and education of&#xD;
the female child, who had now attained&#xD;
the mature age of eighteen years.&#xD;
Happily for Christopher's worldly&#xD;
estate, the little plot of land, the legacy&#xD;
of his parent, situated out of town, as&#xD;
he thought, became the centre of a fash-&#xD;

Christopher was too affectionate a son&#xD;

venues, surrounding his humble dwell-&#xD;

they had previously earned their daily&#xD;

hastily departed, casting a final, furtive&#xD;

as he fastened his strap beneath his&#xD;

"Getting supper for Polly the parrot,"&#xD;

from sone oppressive ;care, "tor I wa&#xD;

The artisan then turned; 4 opene&#xD;

exanlined the style And quality of the&#xD;
garment which Christopher had pro.&#xD;
cured for his charge.&#xD;
"He must be ricb," mutteed Bernard&#xD;
to himself, "to be able toafford 9ii&#xD;

"Now, Mr. iernard,, quoth the me-&#xD;
chanic gaily, "jnst one minute to ex-&#xD;

banker, "youncarry envyour trade upon&#xD;

wager tha  they belong to the dainty&#xD;
eirk who, attends upon the millinery&#xD;
store around the corner. The fellow is&#xD;
false hearted, and will rob his mistress&#xD;

The booktmaker looked at the bottom&#xD;
of the boots, and tossedthem aside with&#xD;
a Contemptuous smile,   ii IIis =ap-&#xD;
prentice picked' up another pair and&#xD;
presented then for comment.&#xD;
"Those, Nicholas," resumed Christo-&#xD;
pher, with a laugh, "belongs to a man&#xD;
anxious to raise in the world, a vain&#xD;
egotist. See, he wants double soles and&#xD;
two very high heels. Do yon hear,&#xD;
Nicholas ; the would-be crane wants&#xD;
very high heels."&#xD;
"I'll fix hi  high enough up," re-&#xD;
sp'onded Mr. Strap, with an emphatic&#xD;
gesture ; "and if he does come down it&#xD;
will be with a run."&#xD;
"But here is a shoe for a study," con-&#xD;
tinued Mr. Last with augmented enthu-&#xD;
siasm; "the sole worn squarely, trod&#xD;
upon all over, not a turn to the right or&#xD;
left. That belongs to al straight for-&#xD;
ward man, one who walks upright in the&#xD;
eyes of the world. If I am not mis-&#xD;
taken it belongs to Dr. Stephen Mo-&#xD;
rand."&#xD;
"Yes, ho is an honest mau indeed,"&#xD;
whispered Genevieve, somewhat ex-&#xD;
citedly, as a blush passed over herwhite&#xD;
forehead.&#xD;
"And who is this.Dr. Morand ?" in-&#xD;
quired the banker.&#xD;
"Dr. Stephen Morand," responded&#xD;
Christopher, " is a young physician,&#xD;
with a noble heart, to whom I owe an&#xD;
eternal debt of gratitude ever since he&#xD;
saved the life of this dear angel of our&#xD;

"Love!" said the young beauty, "is&#xD;
a very strong word, father.','&#xD;
. "Yet ought we not.tolve those," re-&#xD;
joined the bootmaker, "who snatched&#xD;
us from thehaws of death ? There ain't&#xD;
so niany worthy of oin affection as to&#xD;
exhaust the stock on iand.&#xD;
 "Assurey not," said  e banker;&#xD;
"bubaykerg-;&#xD;
"but young ladies have peculiar whims&#xD;
as to the true state of nobility and of&#xD;
humanity.&#xD;
Gnevieve sighed, fob the bootmaker&#xD;
touched upon tender ground; and had&#xD;
the girl confeased ,the truth, she would&#xD;
have frankly admitted that she loved&#xD;
the young physician more deeply than&#xD;
her parent, unversed in the ethics of&#xD;
love, would have suspected.&#xD;
"Possibly Genevieve may think the&#xD;
less of him," said the bootmaker, anx-&#xD;
ious to extenuate her presumed omission&#xD;
in courtesy, for it was now three years&#xD;
since he attended upon her, and nearly&#xD;
all that time he had been absent abroad.&#xD;
Nevertheless, as he returned some two&#xD;
months ago, she should have encoun-&#xD;
tered him some time."&#xD;
" Yes, yes," interposed the young&#xD;
lady, apparently anxious to divert the&#xD;
conversation to somre other and more&#xD;
congenial theme, "I have seen him&#xD;
through the blinds when he stops in to&#xD;
pass an hour with you."&#xD;
"The poor fellow is evidently ufi cr -&#xD;
ing," continued Christopher, wholly en-&#xD;
grossed with the physiciaa's good quaii-&#xD;
ties, "he looks sad and melancholy ; I&#xD;
fear his povert' troubles him - I ana&#xD;
sure of it."&#xD;
The cobbler smiled momentarily in&#xD;
internal enjoynient, for he had thought&#xD;
of a plan of relieving the physician's&#xD;
embarrassment, by inventing some ima-&#xD;
ginary patients, whose fees were real;&#xD;
and to that end had dispatched that&#xD;
very day no less than three letters pur-&#xD;

promising liberal gifts.&#xD;
"With his talents, poverty will not&#xD;
continue long," observed Genevieve ;&#xD;
"and when we love, papa, riches do not&#xD;
claim exclusive attention."&#xD;
"Adorable girl," enthusiastically ex-&#xD;
claimed Christopher, '"the beauties of&#xD;
your person are 'only excelled by the&#xD;
nobility of your mind. Hold, Gene-&#xD;
vieve-the honesty of thy speech de-&#xD;
serves a downright kiss."&#xD;
To the astonishment of Nicholas the&#xD;
apprentice, who had witnessed the&#xD;
avoidance of an embrace for the years&#xD;
of his service, he beheld his master pass&#xD;
&#xD;
his sleeve across his mouth and advance&#xD;
towards the willing, maiden, to bestow&#xD;
upon her a salute. But suddenly he&#xD;
checked himself, and turning around to&#xD;
the banker, he said to him-&#xD;
"We have business in private."&#xD;
Nicholas clapped his hands in amaze-&#xD;
ment, while Genevieve, although accus-&#xD;
tomed to her father's humor, retired in&#xD;
comparative disappointment to her&#xD;
chamber, where she seated herself by&#xD;
the window, and cast many furtive&#xD;
glances into the street in the hope, of&#xD;
catching a glance at the young physi-&#xD;

passing along New York's most fashion-&#xD;
able and aristocratic promenade.&#xD;

CHAPTER VII&#xD;
HONESTY THE BEST POLICY.&#xD;
"Now, then, Mr. Bernard, we are&#xD;
alone."&#xD;
In this wise spoke Christopher Last,&#xD;
as he threw aside his strap and apron,&#xD;
after the withdrawal of his apprentice,&#xD;
before whom the bootmaker maintained&#xD;
the endless appearance of work.&#xD;
"Now, Christopher," said the banker,&#xD;
throwinghimself into a phair and cross-&#xD;
ing his legs in a statesmanlike 'manner,&#xD;
"I have come to ask if you will dispose&#xD;
of your property hereabout."&#xD;
"Who ;wants to buy my shop?" in-&#xD;
quired the bootmaker curtly.&#xD;
"Some speculators desire to establish&#xD;
an exchange on these premises," re-&#xD;
marked Bernard; "and upon my re-&#xD;
commendation they will offer yQu a&#xD;
very handsome price, better than you&#xD;
suppose."&#xD;
"Well," quoththe bootmaker, reflec-&#xD;
tively, "and this done, whereabouts am&#xD;
I to look for a workshop, convenient to&#xD;
my customers ?"&#xD;
"You will have np longer cause to&#xD;
work," remarked the' banker, "for you&#xD;
will be sufficiently rich, although not&#xD;
extravagantly so.",&#xD;
"And, Bernard, is it to amuse me with&#xD;
these golden dreamsthat you take the&#xD;
pains of remaining in my humble resi-&#xD;
dence "&#xD;
"Have you no desire to possess&#xD;
money i" inquired the banker.&#xD;
&#xD;
"In the first place,' Bernard," replied&#xD;
the artisan, tranquilly, "I have never&#xD;
had sufficient acquaintance with the&#xD;
article to become deeply enamored of&#xD;
it, at least to the jeopardy of my peace&#xD;
of mind."&#xD;
"But, honest Christopher," retorted&#xD;
the banker energetically, " you shall&#xD;
become acquainted with the glories of&#xD;
gold coin; yog will throw the lapstone&#xD;
and wax end into the street, and flouiish&#xD;
'as one of the leaders of ton. With the&#xD;
proceeds of this sale invested in oil&#xD;
stock, you will become rich, very rich.&#xD;
It will be but the work of a day or two.&#xD;
.I will sell your property and invest it&#xD;
in three or four well regulated compa-&#xD;
nies, and your fortune is'made."&#xD;
"Ti-tol-derol-de-ro!". whistled the&#xD;
honest shoemaker; "you make me laugh&#xD;
with all your'speculations. If you only&#xD;
knew how happy I have been, how&#xD;
hap y I am within these four walls, you&#xD;
won d never attempt tt make me quit&#xD;
this good old shop. All the speculators&#xD;
in the world can never change.-my cha-&#xD;
racter ; and let each follow our own&#xD;
trade--they like money and Ilike work,&#xD;
and with me there is nothing like&#xD;
leather."&#xD;
"But, Christopher, hear me to the&#xD;
end," urged the banker.&#xD;
"There is no use talking, Ber-nard,"&#xD;
responded the artisan; "Words cannot&#xD;
alter my determination. Suppose I&#xD;
should have a fortune, what would I&#xD;
do with it, who don't know the art of&#xD;
squandering money without making an&#xD;
ass of myself. And, Berhard, would&#xD;
you have me make a fool of myself like&#xD;
the hack driver, who, becoming sud-&#xD;
aenlyrich by-a lucky investment in&#xD;
Pit Hole stock, bought him a carriage,&#xD;
and when in the Central Park, instead&#xD;
of getting inside with his wife, mount-&#xD;

vious'habits."&#xD;
"But, Christopher," intei-rupted the&#xD;
banker, forseeing the inutility of his&#xD;

his negotiations, "reflect upon tle pre&#xD;

your final determination. All in goon&#xD;

"Always happy to see you, Bernard,&#xD;

"Will no sacrifice content you ?" in-&#xD;

"Now listen, madam," resumed the&#xD;
bootmaker, with marked suavity, "I&#xD;
have acquaintance in this quarter od tl e&#xD;

night, and Ihave no desire to live at a&#xD;

young -man of fashionable attire and&#xD;
polished manners; "0, not, nOt as bad&#xD;
as that. I may have been thoughtful,&#xD;
for indeed I felt very melancholy." -&#xD;
"Melancholy, and on what account?'&#xD;
returned Christopher, in an eticourag:&#xD;
ing tone of voice ; "are your patients&#xD;
all cured, or is this section of the town-&#xD;
too healthy to' breed epidemics t  In&#xD;
that case set up to regulate the oilfever.&#xD;
and no quack will ever be more riume-&#xD;

the cobbler, "and should be taken care&#xD;

"What, have I not to complain of for-&#xD;

siastically; " I have grown pale over&#xD;

"Have courage, Stephen," replied&#xD;
Christopher, with an air 'of honesty-,&#xD;
"prosecute your works, and you will be&#xD;
a great physician,"&#xD;
"Yes," rejoined the young man, with&#xD;
a dubious shake 'of ,the head, "it may&#xD;
be so; but while awaiting thedawn of&#xD;
reputation and' renown, Iremain plung-&#xD;

Dr. Morand stopped short in his&#xD;
speech, and paced the floor nervously,&#xD;
for the thought of his poverty recalled&#xD;
to his mind the Impossibility of a suc-&#xD;
cessful competition for the affections of&#xD;

The shoemaker noticed his abstrac-&#xD;

The generosity of Christopher had&#xD;
awakened a new sensation with the&#xD;
young doctor, and lie now experienced&#xD;
a biting feeling of anger at his poverty&#xD;
strickent condition, which precluded his&#xD;
aspirations to the favor of the hand-&#xD;
so-ne opera singer, courted as she was&#xD;
by some dozen of the wealthiest and&#xD;
most distinguished beaux of the town.&#xD;

that discerning youth, aware of the af-&#xD;

refrained from a labor which gave his&#xD;

one thing that bothers me. Why dog't&#xD;
you kiss your daughter?"&#xD;
"Who's put that stupidity into your&#xD;
head ?" asked the bootmaker, angrily.&#xD;
"Now, boss," replied Straj, "there&#xD;
are folks who look upon you as a very&#xD;
neglectful father. Notthat you decline&#xD;
providing her every want, but then you&#xD;
never kiss her. For =instance, to-day,&#xD;
when you bought her these pretty fix-&#xD;
ings, and the poor soul was dying for a&#xD;
kiss, and at night when she parts with&#xD;
you in a voice reaching to your heart,&#xD;
you follow her with your eyes, but&#xD;
never a kiss do you give her."&#xD;
"You pester me, booby," said the&#xD;
artisan, with vehemence ; "I'm a father&#xD;
after my own style, and that suits my&#xD;
own humor."&#xD;
"Each man according to his own&#xD;

her birth, conversed for some minutes&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
THE REVELATION OF TiE SECRET.&#xD;
"Twice have I attempted t commu-&#xD;
nicate with Genevieve to roved1every&#xD;
thing to her, but each time' the woirds&#xD;
stuklin my throat. Not only will' tell&#xD;
the secret of her birth, bit thdt e~ei&#xD;
of my own heart. She niay ladgh4at&#xD;
me-mock me-but she must know how&#xD;
deeply, how sincerely I adore htei !&#xD;
In, truth; the worthy bootmaker h .d&#xD;
made two several attempts to unlhosom&#xD;
himself to his fair  charge. 'he first&#xD;
timn lie found himself too coarse and&#xD;
vulgar to aspire to the' hand of the&#xD;
belle ; on the second, he conceived&#xD;
himself too ugly to compete with the&#xD;
gaily attired suitors ever floating;around-&#xD;
the shrine of beauty.&#xD;
Determining upon a final effort, Mr,&#xD;
Christopher Last resolved upon array-.&#xD;
ing himself in his finest habiliments.&#xD;
Accordingly he summoned to him Ni-&#xD;
cholas to officiate as his valet de chan-&#xD;
bre, who appeared in the little parlor&#xD;
of the bootmaker's d welling, cautiously&#xD;
bearing the hest garments of the arti-&#xD;
tan while blubbering piteously.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Here it is, boss,"quotltha  t&#xD;
tice, wiping his eyes with his Engefes&#xD;
"What's the natter ?" inqquired Chri.&#xD;
topher -" what are' you' blubbeting&#xD;
for?"&#xD;
"0, boss," mourned the.weeping Ni-&#xD;
cholas, "she is so very sick.'&#xD;
"Is Geneyieve sick?" demanded the&#xD;
artisan earnestly.&#xD;
"Polly, boss, Polly," responded Mr.&#xD;
Strap, still weeping.&#xD;
"What's that to me" inquired Chris-&#xD;
topher, tartly.&#xD;
"0, boss, the pretty parrot," retorted&#xD;
Nicholas, in a tone of reproach.&#xD;
"Youare right Niclholas,"replied the&#xD;
bootmaker. 'It wasn't that I alluded&#xD;
to. I thought it was-=-never mind-i&#xD;
is nothing.&#xD;
" Nothing !". ejaculated Nicholas,'. in-&#xD;
disdain; "one iblov tof a elawtineach&#xD;
wingsand two in the. ek-'-that's omie-&#xD;
thin I say                    ,&#xD;
"That cursed spaniel again !" mut-&#xD;
';'The ,assassin.!" exelaimed the ,ap-&#xD;
prei ice; "but I have got him thistie&#xD;
downin the cellar, and if anything&#xD;
happens to Polly --"&#xD;
" Do nothing to 'the dog unless poor&#xD;
Polly dies."&#xD;
" That can't be," returned Nicholas,&#xD;
"as I have sent for Di. Moran'd to come&#xD;
directly, without letting 'him know who&#xD;
for."&#xD;
During this conversation Mr. Christo-&#xD;
pher :Last suiceeeded in ar'aying him-&#xD;
self with his finest and costliest gar-&#xD;
ment, yet surveying himself-n the&#xD;
glass, displaying each portion of his&#xD;
'person, andcriticising his' entire ap-&#xD;
pearance, the bootmaker grew discon-&#xD;
teuted, as he lacked that air of graceful&#xD;
elegance which he had noted in the&#xD;
army of beaux who daily passed by his&#xD;
sho&#xD;
'Nicholas,;is this my best coat ?" in-&#xD;

progressing with his haransue, which&#xD;
he had rehearsed for over a half day,&#xD;
he strove to catch the expression of the&#xD;
young girl's countenance ao the index&#xD;
of her inclinations.&#xD;

Tom: BOOT WAKER OF T~JI1,FYIFTU AEUE.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XT.&#xD;
THE;fWfIEL OF FOnTUN_ L&#xD;
"How, 'atupi fool, to think that she&#xD;
could be -n love with such s-you I Yes,&#xD;
poor dupe of vanity, let zn  enyself&#xD;
as others see me, with my coarse fea-&#xD;
tures, squab form and horny hands!"&#xD;
Mr. Christopher Last placed himself&#xD;
before the looking glass, and, after sur-&#xD;
veying himself a dozeif times or more,&#xD;
arrived at the conclusion that he was&#xD;
no beau, but decidedly a boor Then&#xD;
he consoled himself with the reflection&#xD;
that Genevieve would ever regard her-&#xD;
self as his daughter, which would be&#xD;
honor enough.&#xD;
"Poor Genevieve," soliloquised the&#xD;
bootmaker, in a vain endeavor to dis-&#xD;
pel the clouds oppressing his spirit ;&#xD;
"you shall be happy."&#xD;
. "Boss, here's the boot of the judge,&#xD;
next door, it wants half soling," quoth&#xD;
the shoemaker's apprentice, as ho en-&#xD;
tered the shop, when, observing that&#xD;
Christopher had discarded his fine;&#xD;
clothes, he ejaculated -" What's hap-&#xD;
pened, boss, to make such a change in&#xD;
your looks?"&#xD;
Christopher took the boot, threw it&#xD;
listlessly into his work basket, and,&#xD;
^with a few gruff words, walked sharply&#xD;
down the avenue.&#xD;
" That funny, any how," murmured&#xD;
Nicholas; "boss is as put on his fine&#xD;
clothes to stay in 4 doors, and his apron&#xD;
to go out -doors."&#xD;
41&#xD;
&#xD;
And while Mr. Sharp 'was endea or&#xD;
ing .to solve this domestic misery;' he&#xD;
was suddenly aroused from his-medita-&#xD;
tions by the entry of the 'banker Ber-&#xD;
nard, bearing in his hands sumo seiP't&#xD;
of printed paper, which torthe aippven-&#xD;
tice looked;like enlarged bank notes,&#xD;
"Is Christopher in?" said the banker&#xD;
gaily ; "his fortune's made,.my friend;&#xD;
y,'s, -sir. I tell yon. the bulls are always&#xD;
"t don't know much about a butcher's&#xD;

you hear?"&#xD;
"Yes, I do hear," mutter( d Mr. Strap;&#xD;
but what's short, and what's long?'&#xD;
"The fact is, that a regular fever has&#xD;
broke out," said the banker; "oil is the&#xD;
only thing people will touch, and as&#xD;
each well strikes stock runs from zero&#xD;
to the clouds. Yes, Nicholas, it seems&#xD;
to me that all Wall street is floating&#xD;
about in a big balloon."&#xD;
"I'd like to see it," ejaculated the&#xD;
apprentice incredulously.&#xD;
"I Invested Mr. Last's entire funds,"&#xD;
observed Bernard, blandly.&#xD;
"And what's the boss got to show for&#xD;
them ?" inquired Nicholas.&#xD;
" Shares of stock that yesterday cost&#xD;
ten dollars and to-day will sell at one&#xD;
hundred !" replied the banker; "it was&#xD;
a brilliant stroke, Nicholas, and bought&#xD;
on time. I carry them myself."&#xD;
The apprentice stared at the man of&#xD;
finances in stupid amazement, for the&#xD;
language of Wall street was as empha-&#xD;
tically an unknown tongue to hhu as&#xD;
was that front which Joe Smith tran-&#xD;
slated the b;ble.&#xD;

immense amount of shares; "ydtt see&#xD;
that I am no very smallstockholder.v"&#xD;
"Is' this no dream I"f murmured the&#xD;
physician, as.his eyes fairly glistened at&#xD;
the sight of so much wealth--" whence,&#xD;
all this fortune ?"&#xD;
"It has been fairly gained," resumed&#xD;
Christopher blandly  "I have} ben&#xD;

a pause, "who should thank you, tvho&#xD;

"We are quits then," remarked the,&#xD;
shoemaker, and he chuckled to himself&#xD;
at the idea of the still richer treat he&#xD;
hand in store for Stephen.&#xD;
"Here then have I fortune, 1eury-for&#xD;
a day at least," quota Dr. Morand4 en-&#xD;
thusiasticalIy; " I would have g s.&#xD;
my life in exchange for this unexpected&#xD;

proach her upon terms of equality with'&#xD;
the greatest of my compeers."&#xD;
'Her? where is she TI" interrogated&#xD;
Christopher sharply.&#xD;
"Pardon me, my dear friend," said&#xD;
the doctor with animation; "but I have&#xD;
not told you. A woman worthy of ad-&#xD;

he  hom Genevieve loved should bethe&#xD;

"I will narrate the story of our love,"&#xD;
continued the physician, growing nibre&#xD;
and more enraptued;""I will teil yah&#xD;

day I first saw herlabor  has been irk-&#xD;

that is, the sight of this] angel.' And to&#xD;
you I will owe this happiness."&#xD;
"And do you really love her?" asked&#xD;
Christopher, sonMwhat abruptly&#xD;
"Can you ask me such a question,"&#xD;
replied:Stephen emphatically, "whose&#xD;
whole life has but ,one aim, but one&#xD;
thought."&#xD;
"Poor Genevieve'!- murmured the&#xD;
artisan to himself&#xD;
"Yes, my friend," resumed the phy=,&#xD;
sician, "now that I can appear in her&#xD;

Dr. Morandtbok his hat and afose to&#xD;

It was decidedly fortunate for thelife&#xD;
of Carlo that this clemency ruled th&#xD;
council charged with his fate, for but&#xD;
few' p'tes elapsed before the storf&#xD;
j'I r ed.and there entered thesho&#xD;

no less a distinguished visitor than the&#xD;

of the-threatened animal, who, finding&#xD;
the mission of the footman a decided.&#xD;
failure, condescended to personally in-&#xD;
tercede in behalf of the pet spaniel.&#xD;
The judge's lady came into the store&#xD;
with as much haughtiness as on the&#xD;
yesterday, and passed directly to the&#xD;

the apprentice, although ho had been&#xD;
expressly named as the arch-conspira-.&#xD;
tor against Carlo's life and safety.&#xD;
" Does my presence astonish you,&#xD;
neighbor ?" observed the lady, as she&#xD;
remarked the expression of surprise&#xD;
greeting her advent. "The conversa-&#xD;
tion we had yesterday has given me a&#xD;
gp odopinion of you. I have institq -&#xD;
ed inquiries concerning you, and I as-&#xD;
certain that you are a most estimable&#xD;
man, very popular, and liked by your .&#xD;
customers. On this account I have made&#xD;
no scruple in coming to you in pers-&#xD;
You had a pet bird which my dog hi.&#xD;
killed. I have, perchance, unintention-&#xD;
ally, caused you a poignant sorrow. In&#xD;
what way can I modify it?"&#xD;
"You have been very kind to take all&#xD;
this trouble, madame," responded the&#xD;
bootmaker politely ; "but, what have&#xD;
you to offer me ? Not money. I have&#xD;
more than enough of that already."&#xD;
"If money is of so little account,"&#xD;
rejoined Mrs. Littleton, as a smile illu-&#xD;
minated her sadeountenance, "can there&#xD;
I be nothing which you may desire and it&#xD;
be within my power of gift V"&#xD;
"I ask for nothing, madame," said&#xD;
Christopher, sadly; "there is nothing I&#xD;
long for. I am an unhappy man. Well,&#xD;
when one is deserted of everything he&#xD;
loves, he feels miserable."&#xD;
"To use such language," remarked&#xD;
e the lady, by way of conversation, "one&#xD;
e should have a profound sorrow, which&#xD;
a cannot originate in the loss of a bird,&#xD;
e dear as it was to you." ,&#xD;
S   "Yp, e a w',yeied4 th9e 1 .&#xD;
&#xD;
maker, "there is something else which&#xD;
affects me and renders :ne very un-&#xD;
happy."&#xD;
"Un bosomu yourself, my honest friend,"&#xD;
quoth the lady, the memory of her own&#xD;
sorrows rendering her sympathetic.&#xD;
"Yesterday we were enemies, to-dan&#xD;
when you are unhappy, we are friends;&#xD;
at least, permit me to consider you as&#xD;
one,"&#xD;
"I appreciate your goodness," said&#xD;
Christopher, touched at the kindness&#xD;
and coiidescension of his aristocratic&#xD;
neighbor ; but I fear it is not within&#xD;
your pe wer to lessen my misery."&#xD;
"Who knows," rejoined Mrs. Little-&#xD;
ton ; "but I must know the causic."&#xD;
"In a few words, madame, you shall&#xD;
have it," said the bootmaker, cogitat-&#xD;
ing as to the true method of enunciat-&#xD;
ing his sorrows. "In the first place I&#xD;
have adopted a little girl-a love of a&#xD;
child--"&#xD;
"The beautiful creature I have often&#xD;
times seen laughing, dancing and sing-&#xD;
ing around i " inquired the judge's&#xD;
lady.&#xD;
" Yes, madame, the very same. I&#xD;
passed as her father," replied Christo-&#xD;
pher, with a sigh. "I loved her as if it&#xD;
was really so ; but to-day, to my pain&#xD;
and anguish, I am compelled to part&#xD;
with her !"&#xD;
"How comes that?" interrogated Mrs.&#xD;
Littleton, with interest.&#xD;
"Because," returned the bootmaker,&#xD;
unable to repress his emotion, "she has&#xD;
grown up, and gossips have taken hold&#xD;
of her for scandal. You see I have not&#xD;
augmented -in old age as she has done&#xD;
in grace and beauty, and because, you&#xD;
must know, rather than have the tongue&#xD;
of scandal raised against that innocent&#xD;
angel, I think it better that we two&#xD;
should separate."&#xD;
"Noble and disinterested man!" very&#xD;
warmly spoke the judge's lady, " how&#xD;
kind and considerate to guarantee the&#xD;
purity of that young dependent crea-&#xD;
,ture beyond reach of suspicion."&#xD;
&#xD;
"And, moreover," continued Christo-&#xD;
pher, warmed into confidence by the&#xD;
lady's sympathetic condolence, " there&#xD;
is another point vWhich grieves me, but&#xD;
which I am almost ashamed to disclose&#xD;
to you -&#xD;
"What can that be?" inquired the lady&#xD;
encouragingly.&#xD;
"Well, madame," responded the boot-&#xD;
maker, with a blush, " imagine that I&#xD;
had the vanity to believe that when she&#xD;
found out that she was' not my daugh-&#xD;
ter, she might conclude to become nmy&#xD;
wi- , but the idea was silly, very silly,&#xD;
was it not, madam?"&#xD;
The lady smiled, for she detected the&#xD;
fact of the bootmaker's love.&#xD;
"Yes, madam, it was very silly ; but.&#xD;
then people often live on stupidities ;"&#xD;
and Christopher sighed audibly ; " be-&#xD;
side, now that she has learned that I&#xD;
am not her father, some steps must be&#xD;
taken to ensure her security for the fu-&#xD;
ture, not so ?"&#xD;
"I admire your foresight," returned&#xD;
Mrs. Littleton.&#xD;
'But ' hat am I to do with the dear&#xD;
creature ?"&#xD;
"Have you any objection to placing&#xD;
her temporarily in a' convent, where she&#xD;
can be treated as my daughter by one&#xD;
of my relatives ?"&#xD;
"Alh, madame," said the bootmaker,&#xD;
gratefully, "if such a thing be advisable&#xD;
and for the best, it would be a kindness&#xD;
to do it."&#xD;
"It would be for the best assuredly,"&#xD;
responded the judge's lady, "and I will&#xD;
give you a line of introduction for the&#xD;
superior of the convent of the --,&#xD;
Miss Desmond."&#xD;
"Miss Desmond !" ejaculated the ar-&#xD;
tisan, in surprise.&#xD;
"Yes, my aunt," responded the lady,&#xD;
"who, being the superior of $he sisters,&#xD;
is naturally unmarried, and preserves&#xD;
her nmidcen name, Miss Margaret Des-&#xD;
mond, in accordance with the wish of&#xD;

importunity.&#xD;
"Henrietta?" again inquired Chris-&#xD;

" Henrietta Desmond," replied the&#xD;

"Doubtlessly," returned the lady; "but&#xD;
why this expression of astonishment ?"&#xD;
" Pardon me, madam,"    continued&#xD;
Christopher, apologetically, "and I&#xD;
never to dream of such a thing - how&#xD;
stupid I've been !"&#xD;
"What means this singular behavior?"&#xD;
demanded Mrs. Littleton.&#xD;
"Simply," responded the artisan, " I&#xD;
have been hunting after you for fifteen&#xD;
long and anxious years-that's all."&#xD;
x After me ?" and the lady was lost in&#xD;
bewilderment.&#xD;
"Next door neighbors," moralized the&#xD;
bootmaker ; "and neither of us had airy&#xD;
suspicions as to the other. No wonder&#xD;
you interested yourself in the fate of the&#xD;
little one. It was the cry of nature ;&#xD;
and there can't be stifling of the dic-&#xD;

"What mean you ?" exclaimed Mrs.&#xD;
Littleton ; " speak, and explain the&#xD;
mystery of your yQrds-speak plain."&#xD;
"Do you remember the forest near&#xD;
the village of Beauview ?"&#xD;
"Beauview?" reflected the lady, "yes;&#xD;

"In that piece of wood," quoth C'ris-&#xD;

"Yes, a child-my child !" ('jaculatgd&#xD;

"Madam, accident threw me upon the&#xD;

artisan, pointing significantly to Gene-&#xD;

paused abruptly the moment she per-&#xD;

No sooner had Mrs. Littleton cast her&#xD;
eyes upon the blooming girl, than the&#xD;
recognition of her nativity, became an&#xD;
obvious necessity.  °&#xD;

"Thanks, dearest madam, thanks,"&#xD;
ejaculated the maiden ; "for he has been&#xD;

has almost made me forget that I mourn-&#xD;

"Yes, my poor child," remarked Mrs.&#xD;
Littleton, with difficulty restraining her&#xD;
emotion; "you'have grown up deprived&#xD;
of the solicitous care, of the endearing&#xD;
embraces of a mother. ° Perchance,&#xD;
stung by her desertion, you may have&#xD;

"Genevieve," quoth the shoemaker,&#xD;
anxious to divert the conversation into&#xD;
another channel, "we must not detain,&#xD;
Mrs. Littleton any longer. Go, dearest,&#xD;
and seek her little dog-her pet,"&#xD;
- "Yes, father," responded the girl, in-&#xD;

from clasping her to my bosom, of cov-&#xD;

"Well, well," interposed Christopher,&#xD;
reflecting that lie never once indulged&#xD;
in the luxury of a paternal embrace --&#xD;
"you may kiss her; but then don't tell&#xD;
her who you are ; for, see you, it will&#xD;
not do to avow this child at this precise&#xD;

" That is most true, my worthy&#xD;
friend."&#xD;
" Especially," resumed the shoemak-&#xD;
er, "as she has not yet attained her&#xD;
eighteenth year-at her birth you were&#xD;
unmarried ---"&#xD;
"Alas !" interposed the lady, with a&#xD;
heart-drawn sigh, "the father of my&#xD;
child died in a distant land, far away&#xD;
from her, from me, and from the land of&#xD;
his birth - an exile from family and&#xD;

"Mourn not," quoth the artisan con-,&#xD;

fully.&#xD;
"By the blessing of heaven, we will,"&#xD;

warmly by the hand.&#xD;
"Hush !" observed 'Christopher, with&#xD;
a gesture indicative of secrecy, as Ge-&#xD;
nevieve re-entered the apartment, bear-&#xD;
ing the little spaniel in her arms.&#xD;
So sudden was the entry of the girl,&#xD;
and so lost way Mrs. Littleton in cou-&#xD;
templation of the charms of the young&#xD;
girl, that she neglected to withdraw her&#xD;
hand from the grasp of Christopher.&#xD;
-Jow, my honorable lady," said the&#xD;
bootmaker, noticinZ this omission on&#xD;
the part of his visitor, "is it because he&#xD;
returns you a pet dog that you press the&#xD;
hand of a mechanic ?"&#xD;

receive her spaniel; but' as she ap-&#xD;
proached Genevieve, the young girl&#xD;
failed not to remark that her entire&#xD;
frame was convulsed by a trembling&#xD;
motion.&#xD;
" See, Genevieve," dexterously re-&#xD;
marked Christopher, to account for&#xD;
their visitor's palpable excitement -&#xD;
"how affected the lady is' at refinding&#xD;
her pet !" Then, pointing to Genevieve&#xD;
on the sly, he added-" I give you joy,&#xD;

continued the prima donna, lightly&#xD;
shaking her long, glistening curls,bound&#xD;
to her brow by a diadem of diamonds&#xD;
and precious stones; "but what better&#xD;
 want you? I am tired of being adored&#xD;
-I desired to be bored a little, and that&#xD;
is the cause of my ruin. I was discon-&#xD;

Marcy, with a mocking laugh.&#xD;
"It requires neither sense nor wit to&#xD;
do that," answered Flora.&#xD;
"Brt we have inexhaustible stores of&#xD;
both those unsaleable commodities,"&#xD;
remarked Vanderip, with an affected&#xD;
accent.&#xD;
"Possibly so," rejoined the operatic&#xD;
divinity, "and they will ever remain&#xD;
unsaleable in your hand, for you never&#xD;
show their publicity."&#xD;
"The soiress, suppers and sociables&#xD;
Flora has given, must cost her a hand-&#xD;
some sum," observed a charmnwg come-&#xD;
dienne.&#xD;
"Zuline, you arq right," returned the&#xD;
hostess, who had overheard the remarks&#xD;
- " but I have dreamt of love as it&#xD;
should be -not in gilded halls and&#xD;
brown stone mansions, but in a cottage,&#xD;
a lowly cottage by a mountain stream,&#xD;
and to that end I am selling off all my&#xD;
town and other property."&#xD;
"What a prodigal thought," remark-&#xD;
ed Mr. Marcy.&#xD;
"It was my superfluous jewelry," re-&#xD;
sumed Madame Flora, with an air of&#xD;
nonchalance, "that paid for our first&#xD;
week of revelry. Eight evenings ago,&#xD;
we consumed at supper my boudoirand&#xD;
parlor furniture ; and now my horses.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
carriages and plate are dancing merrily&#xD;
around us. In fact, this is a farewell&#xD;
festivity at this mansion, for this very&#xD;
morning I sold it."&#xD;
"Yo 4 are crazy, Flora," exclaimed&#xD;
Marcy-"mad as a hare."'&#xD;
"It is nevertheless true," 'observed&#xD;
Bernard, the banker ; 'and that is the&#xD;
reason why a little while ago I told you&#xD;
you were all mistaken."'&#xD;
"Well," ejaculated Marcy, "it is a&#xD;
brilliant idea, this rural one. I ow gor-&#xD;
geously we will patronize Flora in her&#xD;
cottage home."&#xD;
"It is so lovely,.so divine,.so pictur-&#xD;

marlked a young operatic,syren who al-&#xD;
*Nys sang the shepherdesses.&#xD;
'Especially when it rains," observed&#xD;
"Dogs it ever rain, in the country "&#xD;
inquired the hostess, languidly.&#xD;
"Never, never," observed Mr. Marcy,&#xD;
exultingly; "when the ground is slightly&#xD;
dry it is watered by troops of pretty&#xD;
shepherdesses, in silk petticoats and&#xD;
embroidered jackets, who water the&#xD;
earth with silver plated watering pots&#xD;
adorned with green ribbons."&#xD;
"Bai! " muttered Flora, moodily ;&#xD;
"rain is a nuisance when one has no&#xD;
carriage, whether town or country."&#xD;
'What a falsifier it was who said -&#xD;
'lucky at cards, unlucky with women,"'&#xD;
quoth Dr. Morand, covering a gaming&#xD;
table at the other end of the apartment&#xD;
around which had been congregated the&#xD;
most inveterate of fashionable game-&#xD;

"Perhaps I shall," returned the bank-&#xD;

Befom e the banker could recover from&#xD;
the sudden amazement into which he&#xD;
had been thrown by the enig natical&#xD;
language of the stranger, Dr. Morand&#xD;
tappet him gently on the shoulder.&#xD;
"Come, Bernard," said the physician,&#xD;
"you are low spirited ; he joyous; life&#xD;

"-Who is lie 1" inquired Dr. Morand,&#xD;
somewhat nervously.&#xD;
"A Pennsylvania Dutchman, I be-&#xD;

a quiet leer twinkled in her fall black&#xD;
eyes, "an arch-millionaire, who solicit-&#xD;

For the amusement of her company,&#xD;

Into the parlor of the opera divinity&#xD;
entered no less a personage than Mr.&#xD;
Christopher Last, arrayed in all the&#xD;
brilliancy of a fell blown fop. Loaded&#xD;
down with chains of gold, diamuon.a&#xD;
and precious stones, giving himi he ap.&#xD;
pearance of a peripatetic jewellers' shop.&#xD;
Upon assuming his new dignity,\ the&#xD;
worthy artisan had expended his inge-&#xD;
nuity on an over elaboration of his&#xD;
person. His clothes were embroidered&#xD;
vi h gold and silver, and strewn with&#xD;
pearls, rubies and other valuables. In&#xD;
tact, Mr. Last had purchased the cos-&#xD;
tume of a foreign ambassador, and caus-&#xD;
ed it to be adorned with additional em-&#xD;

The assembled guests g gthered in&#xD;
mute wonderment around this .)trange&#xD;

"That's him !" exclaimed Delamore,&#xD;
with a sarcastic smile.&#xD;
" What a guy !" ejaculated Marcy,&#xD;
joining in the laughing chorus.&#xD;
"It's Christopher Last, the bootmak-&#xD;
or," said Dr. Morand.&#xD;
"Yes, that me," quoth the artisan,&#xD;
with a mock, polite bow; "I own to the&#xD;
corn ; but how the dickens did you know&#xD;
me in this harness?"&#xD;
"A bootmaker !" exclaimed the ladies&#xD;
of the opera, holding up their hands in&#xD;
holy horror at the idea of such contami-&#xD;
nation.&#xD;
nanwihat !" exclaimed Madame Flora,&#xD;
indulging in a hearty peal of laughter ;&#xD;
"is my distinguished friend a boot-&#xD;
maker ?"&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am, at your service," re-&#xD;
sponded Christopher frankiy. "1Never-&#xD;

oil in the deepest well, and have a hen-&#xD;
dred thousand dollars to spend iw' 1 day.&#xD;
I ata what you may call a genteel, if&#xD;
not noble, working man."&#xD;
"By my faith," quoth Marcy, with a&#xD;
shrug of the shoulders, "as times go,&#xD;
one can scarcely know who is ripit and&#xD;
who is poor. Accept my compliments,&#xD;
my most noble mender of boots."&#xD;
"As I don't take anything for noth-&#xD;

your bouts for nothing-I understand&#xD;
your affairs."&#xD;
"But, my worthy friend," interposed&#xD;
Bernard the banker, "you said you had&#xD;
one hundred thousand dollars to expend&#xD;
in one day 1"&#xD;
"Well, I did," replied Christopher;&#xD;
."and Iwill say so again.&#xD;
"But your entire wealth is but on c&#xD;
hundred thousand."&#xD;
"Can't I spend that in one dayI]&#xD;
gained it in that time!"&#xD;
"Thaw's so," ejaculated the banker&#xD;
and ho went off into a profound revery&#xD;
&#xD;
"My dear friend," observed Dr. Mo-&#xD;
rand, "I did not think you so rich."&#xD;
"Possibly," replied the bootinaker ;&#xD;
"but capital accumulates rapit'ly in oil&#xD;
stock ;' and then Christopher added re-&#xD;
proachfully-"We have not seen you,&#xD;
Stephen, for over a fortnight."&#xD;
"But why do you call yourself Van&#xD;
Der Last ?"&#xD;
"To make my entry among the fash-&#xD;
ionables, I found Lust, although good&#xD;
for a bootmaker, entirely too vulgar for&#xD;
a rich millionaire, so I went to a heral-&#xD;
dry man and got made into a noble&#xD;
man with a coat of arms thrown is for&#xD;
a fifty dollar greenback. He traced my&#xD;
pedigree back to the bootmakers of Hol-&#xD;
land, and christened me after the Van&#xD;
Der Lasts, own cousins to the Van Der&#xD;
Pevels who were sheep was:ers."&#xD;
As the worthy parvenue spoke, he&#xD;
moved about uneasily, for his clothes&#xD;
were anything bit a good fit, and the&#xD;
pantaloons somewhat incommoded his&#xD;
pedestrianism as he affected a slight&#xD;
swagger.&#xD;
"You don't seem to be easy in your&#xD;
fine clothes," remarked Marcy.&#xD;
"The fo-x, is, that these clothes was&#xD;
not ma de for me," rejoined the boot-&#xD;
maker, cam it.y--"I bought them because&#xD;
they were covered with finery. A man&#xD;
with greenbacks in his' pocket has a&#xD;
right to have gold on his back, other-&#xD;
wise people vouldn't know it."&#xD;
"Yes, but yoa cut a funny figure,"&#xD;
said a lady with a smile.&#xD;
"Better to laugh than to cry,' re tort-&#xD;
ed the shoemaker, sarcastically. "You&#xD;
t folks earn your living in trying to please&#xD;
pcople,and why can't I spend my money&#xD;
in making others laugh-it's about the&#xD;

"I believe it, ' returned the artisan,&#xD;
vainly endeavoring to finish a low bow;&#xD;
"madam," he added, after -a moment's&#xD;
pause, "excuse my not making a bow;&#xD;

made for me, and they're a little too&#xD;
tight about the -"&#xD;
A scream from the horrified fair sex&#xD;
abruptly terminated the sentence.&#xD;
Christ opher cast his eyesover the ob-&#xD;
ject of Dr, Morand s-adoration, and in-&#xD;
stituted a mental comparison between&#xD;
her and Genevieve, and, as may be ex-&#xD;
pected, the balance was struck in the&#xD;
latter's favor.&#xD;
"You're a splendid woman," observ-&#xD;
ed the artisan; " no wonder you turn&#xD;
the heads of the opera goers; you ought&#xD;
to, ma'am."&#xD;
"You clatter me, Mr. Van Der Last,"&#xD;
said Flora, with a faint smile.&#xD;
Just then the music of a quadrille&#xD;
broke upon the ear from an adjoining&#xD;
apartment.&#xD;
"Gentlemen," said the lady, rising&#xD;
from her seat and extending her arm&#xD;
towards the artisan, "the last sett be-&#xD;

mechanic, anticipating the doctor's ac-&#xD;
ceptance of the lady's implied iavita-&#xD;

conversation with this gentleman."&#xD;
&#xD;
And as the bootipaker spoke, he pass.&#xD;
ed his arm through that of Dr. Morand,&#xD;
who was under too many obligations to&#xD;
the artisan publicly to resent this vex.&#xD;
atious interference with his mistress.&#xD;
"With me," observed Stephen, cast-&#xD;
ing a glance upon his hostess, who could&#xD;
scarce conceal a smile at witnessing her&#xD;
admirer's embarrassment---"O, certain-&#xD;
ly ; that is, if Flora will allow of it."&#xD;
"No, gentlemen, do not allow me to&#xD;
interfere with your arrangements," re-&#xD;
spon(led the opera queen, with a gra-&#xD;
cious wave of the hand, as she passed&#xD;
into the adjoining apartment to direct&#xD;
the revels of her guests and to regulate&#xD;
the order of their dancing.&#xD;
"You are now happy, my friend," said&#xD;
the bootmaker, as he and the physician&#xD;
paced the deserted chamber, "in the&#xD;

other like a pair of turtle doves."&#xD;
"Of all hearts hers is the most sensi-&#xD;

"Of her disinterestedness," resumed&#xD;

"there can be no question. Neverthe-&#xD;

"I, my dear Van Der Last?" exclaim-&#xD;
ed the physician.&#xD;
"Assuredly," resumed the bootmak-&#xD;
er, preserving his accustomed gravity ;&#xD;
"I would have been at a loss as to the&#xD;
manner of approaching the divine Flora&#xD;
upon so tender a matter, but you have&#xD;
broken the ice for me, and avowed my&#xD;
passion in tender words whiicli I never&#xD;
could have invented. The lady now&#xD;
knows the object of my attentions-&#xD;
from this moment I journey alone."&#xD;
"Come, then," said Flora, with a&#xD;
smile, "in the forward march."&#xD;
"Yes, if it suits the gentleman's hu-&#xD;
mor ; "and as he spoke the bootmaker&#xD;
wade a gesture motioning Stephen to&#xD;
the other room.&#xD;
"If I can comprehend a hint," said&#xD;
Dr. Morand, good humoredly, "that is-&#xD;
an intimation that I had better be oil.,&#xD;
"Precisely the object of my demon-&#xD;
stration."&#xD;
"Well, Flora, what advise you ?F"&#xD;
quoth the physician, smiling.&#xD;
"In faith, my dear," replied the fair&#xD;
singer languidly, "I am so bewildered,&#xD;
to see myself captured by Mr. Van Per&#xD;
Last ---".&#xD;
"Very wel1", reqnded Dr. Morand,&#xD;

F /&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
reindulging hi hilarity, "you counte-&#xD;
nanco the conflict. Mr. Van Per Last&#xD;
I leave you in occupation of the field-&#xD;
open your batteries. It" is a very royal&#xD;
joke, and I hope you will enjoy it like&#xD;
fy Flora." . .&#xD;
The happy lover made a low obeig&#xD;
ance to the object of his adoration and&#xD;
quitted the apartment.&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Van Der Last," commenc-&#xD;
ed the hostess, as she assumed a seat&#xD;
upon the tete-a-tete, aced motioned her&#xD;
guest to her side, "the hostilities are&#xD;
declared ; behold me on the defensive ;&#xD;
comnenco firing, or must I surrender&#xD;
at discretion upon summons ?"&#xD;
"I am predisposed, madam," said the&#xD;
bootmaker, maintaining his erect posi-&#xD;
tion, and rubbing his legs with his&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
"Has the gentleman the rheumatism?"&#xD;
inquired the lady.&#xD;
"Not at all," returned Christopher,&#xD;
seating himself after some contortions&#xD;
upon an ottoman at his syren's feet. "If&#xD;
I should venture, Madame Flora, upon&#xD;
love phrases, I feel that I may, through&#xD;
sheer inexperience, make myself ridi-l&#xD;
culous ---"'&#xD;
"Maybe so," returned the singer, with&#xD;
nonchalance.&#xD;
"Then I will speak straight to the&#xD;
point," resumed Christopher, in a na-&#xD;
tural way. "There is one thing in which&#xD;
I am not ridiculous, not even in your&#xD;
eyes-I am very rich --"&#xD;
"My dear fellow," retorted the syren,&#xD;
'I have laughed in the face of people&#xD;
who have been equally rich with you-&#xD;
of men who could not boast one-third&#xD;
the impudence you possess --&#xD;
"That was the reason they did not&#xD;
succeed.-,&#xD;
"You flatter yourself."&#xD;
"Moreover, those people," continued&#xD;
the bootmaker, "had a mind to keep&#xD;
their money--on the other hand, my&#xD;
weaJb is a source of annoyance to me."&#xD;
&#xD;
"A source of annoyance 1" repeated&#xD;
Madame Flora.&#xD;
"Yes, madam," replied Christopher ;&#xD;
"and I entertain the idea of diseneum-&#xD;
berImg myself right away."&#xD;
"Would you negaar ypurself 7" in-&#xD;
quired th iatr songstress.&#xD;
"That is my determination," coolly&#xD;
replied the bootmaker ; and as I desire&#xD;
to retire to my old business, I wish to&#xD;
make myself thoroughly dry before the&#xD;
end of three or four days. You see I've&#xD;
work before me."&#xD;
"A fortune like yours !" said the&#xD;
singer incredulously.&#xD;
'"Do you think that it would be won-&#xD;
derful not to be able to get rid of all&#xD;
that within four or five days "&#xD;
"Let us see," said the syren, with a&#xD;
serious look, "are you really inclined to&#xD;
make way with your wealth as you&#xD;
say ,&#xD;
"I," quoth the mechanic, determi-&#xD;
nately, "I pledge you my word and&#xD;
honor that I shall become in four days&#xD;
as poor as a beggar or-a cobbler ; and&#xD;
the best proof of my sincerity is the&#xD;
fact of my addressing myself to your&#xD;
assistance -"'&#xD;
"Not bad, that idea," said the song-&#xD;
stress; "and I avow to you that under&#xD;
other circumstances and at another pe-&#xD;
riod, all that you have told me might&#xD;
have plunged me into a revery ; but at&#xD;
the present moment it is --"&#xD;
"The present moment?" inquired&#xD;
Christopher, sharply.&#xD;
"At this present moment," quoth the&#xD;
operatic divinity, "I love --"&#xD;
"You love !" retorted the bootmaker;&#xD;
"you are mistaken-that flirtation was&#xD;
a pleasantry which has lasted some fif-&#xD;
teen days, and having run its race, it is&#xD;
full time that it was finished."&#xD;
" And for what reason I" inquired&#xD;
Madame Flora.&#xD;
"Because I have secured," responded&#xD;
Christopher, "the most amusing and&#xD;
malignant means to enrage your little&#xD;

making sport of you."&#xD;
Making sport of me at the opera ?"&#xD;
inquired the % dy, testily.&#xD;
"To be sure," replied the bootmaker,&#xD;
maliciously. "They say that you have&#xD;
sold your horses, because you could not&#xD;
maintain them; that you spoke of going&#xD;
to live in the country because you have&#xD;
no longer the withal to flourish in the&#xD;
city; nd that you have put on the sem-&#xD;
blance of loving simply to avoid impu-&#xD;
tation of being loved by some of your&#xD;
former admirers."&#xD;
"And all these stories are told of me!"&#xD;
murmured the lady, vexedly.&#xD;
"I have heard them myself in the&#xD;
green room," responded the artisan; but&#xD;
this time the honest Christopher indulg-'&#xD;
ed in a pure fabrication, for he had as&#xD;
much knowledge of the moon as of the&#xD;
operatic green room. "In fine, they've&#xD;
promised to crush you out of your lux-&#xD;
uries as you have served them hereto-&#xD;
fore."&#xD;
"Will they? We shall see about that."&#xD;
"We shall see," continued Christo-&#xD;
pher, sarcastically, "you ruin yourself&#xD;
to make a sensation. Is it not better to&#xD;
create a much more profound excite-&#xD;
ment in ruining me ?"&#xD;
"Ruining you ? "said the singer; "are&#xD;
you really worth the trouble?"&#xD;
"You will never find better work,"&#xD;
replied the artisan; "11 am seeking for&#xD;
some person to throw my gold out of the&#xD;
window ; some one who will cause the&#xD;
whole race of extravagant females to&#xD;
die out of pure envy ; some one who&#xD;
will devour ten thousand, fifteen thou-&#xD;
sand, twenty thousand of greenbacks in&#xD;

vious growlers in th3ir mire, and soar&#xD;
above them upon golden wings."&#xD;
" Ah, my good friend, " murmured&#xD;
Flora to herself, "a hundred thousand&#xD;
dollars in a day. What jealousies can&#xD;
be wrought by such a ruin! But tell&#xD;
me frankly why tempt me in this man-&#xD;
ner?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why ?" repeated Christopher, with&#xD;
a smile ; "go down into your stable,&#xD;
and you Will find that tile horses vend-&#xD;
ed by you have been purchased by me.'&#xD;
Ope.) these caskets," here the mechanic&#xD;
drew some jewel cases from his pocket,&#xD;
"and you will find the pearls and dia-&#xD;
monds which you have sold, and pur,.&#xD;
chased by me. In fine, cast your eyes&#xD;
over this document which reconveys to&#xD;
you this mansion, sold by your orders,&#xD;
purchased by mine."&#xD;
"Can this be possible ?" quoth the&#xD;
opera syren, as she took the title deeds&#xD;
into her hands; "he must love me to&#xD;
distraction."&#xD;
"Distraction !" repeated Christopher,&#xD;
gaining courage as he observed how ef-&#xD;
fectually his temptation was ,working&#xD;
"that is nothing near the word. Yes,&#xD;
Flora, for a long time past my hearthas&#xD;

my adoration of you !"&#xD;
'r The bootmaker paused, for he had ex-&#xD;
hausted his set speech, while the pers-&#xD;
piration stood in drops upon lis brow.&#xD;
Suddenly flinging himself at the Yeet of&#xD;
.the syren after the most approved man-&#xD;
ner of the stage lover, Christopher cqn-&#xD;
tinued-"Flora, Iswear, at your feet,&#xD;
at your delicious feet, Flora, dearest&#xD;
angel, light of my soul, at yourfeet.*&#xD;
Christopher suddenly ceased, and gazed&#xD;
in rapture upon theshoes covering the&#xD;
feet he so enthusiastically eulogized.&#xD;
After a pause, he added -" About the&#xD;
neatest pair of rights and lefts I've seen&#xD;
in many a day."&#xD;
"What is that you are saying V"- ex-&#xD;
claimed the astounded Flora.&#xD;
"How elaborately worked," continu-&#xD;
ed Christopher, still lost in admiration&#xD;
of the shoemaker's tact ; "they are not&#xD;
shoes, but jewel cases."&#xD;
"Good heavens!" exclaimed Flora,&#xD;
"the artist reappears-he is adoring my&#xD;
shoes !" and the lady laughed heartily ..&#xD;
"Yes,. pardon me," observed the 'e-&#xD;
chanic, recovering self-possession, "Ali,&#xD;

"Raise, raise} my dear fellow," com-&#xD;
manded the singer; "come from your&#xD;

you are taking my measure."&#xD;
"Not a bit of danger, madam," said&#xD;
Christopher, sadly; "in looking upon&#xD;
your features allhope of work is banish-'&#xD;

"A very pretty compliment, Mr. Van&#xD;
Der Last," quoth the hostess, with a&#xD;
gracious smile ; "but excuse me 'if IY&#xD;
speak frankly to you. - Let me assure&#xD;
you that I love Dr. Moran d even yet,&#xD;
and that I do not detest my good friends&#xD;
of the opera. On these accounts, there-&#xD;
fore, you must pardon me if I do not&#xD;
accept your offer."&#xD;
"Well, well," returned the bootniaker&#xD;
sedately, "confidence begets confidence&#xD;
-let me assure you, madam, that I do&#xD;
not entertain for you the least particle&#xD;
of love; but I love Stephen dearly., He&#xD;
is a noble young man, whom it is the&#xD;
duty of us both to save'--"&#xD;
"To save !" ejaculated the operatic&#xD;
queen, in amazement.&#xD;
"He must be drawn from this life of&#xD;
disorder," remarked Christopher, feel&#xD;
ingly ; "from this course of life-use-&#xD;
less, aimless, profitless and honoriess-&#xD;
through which he forfeits'the esteenI of&#xD;
others and respect for Ihimself. In a&#xD;
word, his salvation must'be' wrought !"&#xD;
"But in what particular have I aided&#xD;
in his perdition ?"-&#xD;
"In what,. my poor friend ?" quoth&#xD;
the bootmaker, with a tone of generous'&#xD;
dignity, "you only see the happiness of'&#xD;
to-day-you, who have only smilingly&#xD;
to extend the hand to see it filled with&#xD;
gold; but we who earn our daily bread&#xD;
by the sweat of our brow, we think of&#xD;
the future. Now then what is the pros-&#xD;
pect before Dr. Morand "&#xD;
The artiste moved nervously on her&#xD;
seat, but interrupted not the thread of&#xD;
the discourse, which Christopher de-&#xD;
livered with effective emphasis.,&#xD;
&#xD;
79&#xD;
&#xD;
"He is gay, brilliant and happy,". re-&#xD;
sumed the artisan, "with fine clothes&#xD;
upon his back and money in his-pocket,&#xD;
all-of which comes neither from hisfa&#xD;
mily nor his labor. Tell me, is this&#xD;
honorableI He is the lover of an ar-&#xD;
tiste, and instead ol his ruining himself&#xD;
to please her, which would be solely .a&#xD;
misfortune, it is she who is ruining her-&#xD;
self to gratify him, which is shame-&#xD;
"Opinions may differ, sir," interpos-&#xD;
ed Flora, evidently touched.&#xD;
"Whenyou have ceasedto love him,"&#xD;
said Christopher prophetically, "and&#xD;
let me tell you, that will -be. before&#xD;
long."&#xD;
"What warrant lve you for saying&#xD;
thus 1" inquired the lady.&#xD;
"It will be before long," repeated the&#xD;
bootmake. "You will;Pot love for any&#xD;
length of time a man degraded in your&#xD;
eyes, and you will shed bitter tears for&#xD;
having, yourself, been th cause of his&#xD;
degradation. Yes, you weep in anguish,&#xD;
for you have a good heart."&#xD;
"I weep-I, a mere actress !' and&#xD;
Flora was unable to master, her agita-&#xD;

You have    good heart, as I well&#xD;
know, for I have worked for poor peo-&#xD;

"Stephen will continue fo love-you, in-&#xD;

"Killed himself!" ejaculated the fair&#xD;
singer, with a movement of terror.&#xD;
"Yes, madam, that will be the inevi-&#xD;
table termination of the affair," quoth&#xD;
the artisan, growing more and more se-&#xD;
rious. "You see I have spoken to you&#xD;
frankly. Now shall it terminate other-&#xD;
wise?"&#xD;
A moment of suspense followed this&#xD;
pointed query.. Flora, intensely agitat-&#xD;
ed,seemingly by contradictory motives,&#xD;
moved nervously in her seat ; while the&#xD;
honest mechanic cast his eyes upon her&#xD;
imploringly, as if exhorting her to a&#xD;
final declaration.&#xD;
"My dear friend," said the singer,&#xD;
after a moment's deliberation, "the af-&#xD;
fair shall terminate otherwise than you&#xD;
anticipate."&#xD;
" And what is your solemn conclu-&#xD;
sion ?" asked Christopher.&#xD;
"From this hour we separate," replied&#xD;
the artiste firmly ; "lead Stephen away&#xD;
from this house-I will never see him&#xD;
again !"1&#xD;
"0, madam, do not deceive me !" ex-&#xD;
claimed the bootmaker, his joy contrast-&#xD;
ing strangely with the lady's grief, "for&#xD;
you know the full extent of the favor&#xD;

gle existence depends upon&#xD;

While the tender hearted actress,&#xD;
overpowered by the violent reaction of&#xD;
her feelings, sunk back for rest against&#xD;
her lounge, the delighted bootmaker,&#xD;
overjoyed at having obviated, as he&#xD;
supposed,.the only obstacle in the way&#xD;
of Genevieve's marriage, threw himself&#xD;
upon his knees before the lady, and,&#xD;
seizing her hand, pressed it to his lips&#xD;
in grateful acknowledgment of her sac-&#xD;
rif ve,&#xD;
"You are a noble woman !" quoth the&#xD;
bootmaker in undisguised enthusiasm ;&#xD;
and he again kissed the hand of the&#xD;
songstre s, whom he regarded as a bene-&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XV[L&#xD;
CUPID'S WINGS CLIPPED.&#xD;
"Bravo ! bravo! the.'fii-st bit of acting&#xD;
ever seen on any stage'!"&#xD;
Dr. Stephen Morand, returning from&#xD;
the ball room, viewed the spectacle be-&#xD;
fore him as a species of ludicrous inter-&#xD;
lude, contrived for his surprise or vex-&#xD;
ation and acted as by preconcerted ar-&#xD;
rangement between the leading parties&#xD;
to the scheme.&#xD;
"Stephen ! " murmured the singer,&#xD;
with palpable emotion, as she ventured&#xD;
to turn an affectionate glance upon her&#xD;
admirer.&#xD;
"Courage !" whispered Christopher,&#xD;
as he arose from his kneeling position;&#xD;
"I have wagered with him that you will&#xD;
give me the ring and bracelet, which he&#xD;
has hitherto presented to you."&#xD;
"It shall be done," rejoined the lady,&#xD;
her heart throbbing violently.&#xD;
"Mr. Van Der Last," said Dr. Mo-&#xD;
rand, who comprehended that the scene&#xD;
before him was. no work of fantasy,&#xD;
"this is downright treason."&#xD;
"Treason !" ejaculated the bootmak-&#xD;
er, with a smile..&#xD;
"Without doubt,'' responded the doc-&#xD;
tor, attempting to shield his resentment&#xD;
behind a parade of hilarity, "youshould&#xD;
have employed for the capture of Flora&#xD;
the arguments of a financier, and I find&#xD;
you puffing at her feet like a comedy&#xD;
lover   "&#xD;
"What right have you to dictate&#xD;
terms ?" retorted Christopher, with as-&#xD;
sumed anger, so as to give the cue to his&#xD;
fellow performer ; " what matters the&#xD;
manner as long as we attain success l"&#xD;
"You need not vindicate your beha-&#xD;
vior, Mr. Van Der Last;" and the heart&#xD;
of Flora smote her as she played a part&#xD;
of duplicity so uncongenial to her na-&#xD;
ture, but consonant with her sense of&#xD;
duty ; "when a person acts with that&#xD;
delicacy and refinement which has cha-&#xD;
racterized your every action,oie can af-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BOOT MAKER OF THE FIFTH -AVENUE.&#xD;
&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
ford to brave the railleries of the en-&#xD;
vious, the puerile, the discarded."&#xD;
" How say you, Flora?" nervously&#xD;
inquired Dr. Morand.     .&#xD;
"I say," replied the singer, tranquilly,&#xD;
"that Mr. Van Der Last is a man of&#xD;
wit, humor and common sense-a most&#xD;
noble heart."&#xD;
"Is that your settled conviction?"'re-&#xD;
torted Stephen, with a sneer.&#xD;
"He has demonstrated to me," con-&#xD;
tinued the actress, noting the effect pro-&#xD;
duced by her words, "that our intimacy&#xD;
is a folly."&#xD;
"That's so!" chimed in the bootmak-&#xD;
er in a low tone of voice.&#xD;
" A folly I'' exclaimed Stephen, in&#xD;
amazement. " Come now, Flora, you&#xD;
are joking-you know how sincerely I&#xD;
love you, and --"&#xD;
"It is on that very account," rejoined&#xD;
the lady, with calmness and dignity,&#xD;
"that I speak to you in soberness of&#xD;
spirit.&#xD;
"Am I dreaming I" murmured the&#xD;
young physician, astounded at the se-&#xD;
rious change which matters were as-&#xD;
suming, "speak, then, fully and freely;&#xD;
"hesitate not, but decree my doom."&#xD;
."He has caused me to comprehend,"&#xD;
resumed the actress, tear drops starting&#xD;
to her eyes, "that this folly may per-&#xD;
chance become a fault,.if not a disaster,&#xD;
and that it is our duty-that of both of&#xD;
us-to put a termination to its longer&#xD;
continuance."'&#xD;
"Yes, yes ; and you," said Stephen,&#xD;
turning to the artisan, "have demon-&#xD;
strated by your fine arguments all this&#xD;
to her comprehensionI"&#xD;
"Yes, she comprehends it thorough-&#xD;
ly," returned Christopher gravely.&#xD;
"I am anxious to learn," quoth the&#xD;
doctor to the lady, ironically, " what&#xD;
pressing reasons, 'what unanswerable&#xD;
arguments Mr. Van Der Last has been&#xD;
able to advance to determine your line&#xD;
of duty."&#xD;
"Frhaps they may not be satifactorr&#xD;
&#xD;
to you," returned Flora, affecting to&#xD;
smile. "But perceive to what lengths&#xD;
went his delicate foresight. I was com-&#xD;
pelled to sacrifice some jewels. See, he,&#xD;
hag brought themfback."&#xD;
Stephen blushed ; for in the jewel&#xD;
case produced by the bootmaker, he re-&#xD;
cognized the brilliants and rubies which&#xD;
but a few days before the singer had&#xD;
disposed of to raise money for t eir mu-&#xD;
tual extravagances. It was a first tingle&#xD;
of a budding shame.&#xD;
"Yes, these are my fao'ner property,"&#xD;
observed the actress calmy. "You per-&#xD;
ceive this ring which I wear upon this&#xD;
finger ; I regret to be compelled to re-&#xD;
move it, but it must be so. To von,&#xD;
Mr. Van Der Last, I make over this ring&#xD;
in exchange foryour disinterested kind-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
As Madame Plora spoke she removed&#xD;
the love token presented to' her by&#xD;
Stephen, and supplied" its place by&#xD;
another given her by the artisan to&#xD;
whom she remitted the first jewel. The&#xD;
young physician gazed in astonishment&#xD;
at this operation, so unexpected and so&#xD;
aggravating, and premonitory of his&#xD;
inevitable destiny. The bootmaker ac-&#xD;
cepted the transfer with silent stolidity,&#xD;
merely venturing to implant a kiss upon&#xD;
the hand of the beautiful donor.&#xD;
"And my bracelet," continued Flora,&#xD;
as she opened a second case presented&#xD;
to her by her new guest, "those beauti-&#xD;
ful emeralds which I mourned over so&#xD;
oftentimes in silent sorrow, and return-&#xD;
ed to me. Hold, my dear Mr. Van Der&#xD;
a Last ! How can I repay you, for I am&#xD;
sure that the pretty trinket I now wear&#xD;
will scarce compensate you for your&#xD;
outlay in regaining my cherished trea-&#xD;
sures."&#xD;
t   "The bracelet I gave her !" muttered&#xD;
Stephen, in agony of spirit, as he ob-&#xD;
i served his former lady love tranquilly&#xD;
3 pass over to the mechanic that souvenir&#xD;
of affection which she had promised&#xD;
y eternally tower fophis sake, and whiel&#xD;

Christopher pocketed with the most im-&#xD;
placable nonchalance.&#xD;
"Enough, enough!" exclaimed Steph-&#xD;
en, with a groan. "Flora, you have be-&#xD;
trayed me !" And then turning his&#xD;
grief into anger, he continued, vehe-&#xD;
mently - "I comprehend everything ;&#xD;
and if there is anything that can con-&#xD;
sole me for this unworthy treason it is&#xD;
the choice of a person you have made&#xD;
to replace me."&#xD;
"Rail against me to your full bent,"&#xD;
returned Christopher, meekly; "it don't&#xD;
make much difference; I am used to it,&#xD;
Stephen."&#xD;
"Somepday or the other, Stephen,"&#xD;
said the lady, with a deep melancholy,&#xD;
palpable upon her beauteous cointe-&#xD;
Dance, her utterance choked by half&#xD;
subdued sobs, "you will comprehend&#xD;
and appreciate the motives for my ac-&#xD;
tion, but now they must remain, at least.&#xD;
for a time, a mystery to you. Stephen,&#xD;
fare thee well !"&#xD;
The lady dropped her eyes, for her&#xD;
heart was overtasked at the sudden gra-&#xD;
vity of the task she had imposed upon&#xD;
herself. Waving her hand as a sign of&#xD;
adieu, she was about to retire from, the&#xD;
chamber, when her feelings overpower-&#xD;
ed her, and her pent up emotions found&#xD;
a vent in the unrestrained flow of tears.&#xD;
"Flora ! Flora !" exclaimed the phy-&#xD;
sician, attempting to detain the de-&#xD;
spairing singer, "you will repent of this&#xD;
cruelty.",&#xD;
"Never!" exclaimed the lady-' ycu&#xD;
will bless me for this wound."&#xD;
'Madame Flora," interrupted the&#xD;
bootmaker, catching the singer by the&#xD;
arm, speaking to her in a semi-audible&#xD;
tone of voice, "you have forgotten the&#xD;
reconveyance, according to contract."&#xD;
"Contract !" ejaculated the lady -&#xD;
"what mean you ?"&#xD;
"I surrender to you your mansion,"&#xD;
responded the bootmaker, handing over&#xD;
to her the title deeds and reconveyance&#xD;
of the property she had on the morning&#xD;
sold =i you-have=earhed it nobly "&#xD;
&#xD;
"You are mistaken, sir," rejoined the&#xD;
actress, with an air of offended dignity,&#xD;
"I have earned nothing-my ways are&#xD;
those of the heart, and my reward will&#xD;
be paid me in the future."&#xD;
With a deliberate and collected ac-&#xD;
tion, the fair hostess tore the reconvey-&#xD;
ance of her forfeited mansion into a&#xD;
dozen fragments, and politely handed&#xD;
the title deeds back to the disconcerted&#xD;
doner; then,-with a graceful wave of the&#xD;
hand, she bade adieu to her guests, en-&#xD;
tertained for the last time.&#xD;
"Cruel, heartless, sordid woman !"&#xD;
muttered the physician, as he Viewed&#xD;
the departing jgure of his late mistress.&#xD;
"Nothing of the kind," said the boot-&#xD;
maker, approaching his friend. " Be-&#xD;
lieve me you are but a mere boy in the&#xD;
ways of the world. Your study has&#xD;
been confined to books.. Suddenly you&#xD;
find yourself thrown into the vortex of&#xD;
fashionable existence ;and you believe&#xD;
that everything glittering around. you&#xD;
is gold. It is'natural; but you Perceive&#xD;
how false the idea. Desert this world&#xD;
of art-return with me. Certainly this&#xD;
woman loves you not-and who-knows&#xD;
but that in a less artificial sphei e you&#xD;
may find some honest and noble girl&#xD;
who may love, if she does not already."&#xD;
"And who would deceive me at trea-&#xD;
oherously as did this last.".&#xD;
"That is not true," said the artisan,&#xD;
emphatically. No, sir; you calumniate&#xD;
my angel of innocence-my Genevieve."&#xD;
"Genevieve 1" inquired Stephen -&#xD;
"what is the meaning of all this ?"&#xD;
"I will tell you frankly," quoth the&#xD;
bootmaker, "that' it was not to please&#xD;
Madame Flora that I came here, but to&#xD;
separate you from  her. Now then,&#xD;
Stephen, turn your back upon vanity&#xD;
and let ua depart."&#xD;
The young physician listened to the&#xD;
advice of his mentor, and was about to&#xD;
retire, although with deep regret, frosts&#xD;
the mansion of his enchantress, when h&#xD;
and the mechanic found theinselve8&#xD;

surrounded by the entire group of dan-&#xD;
cers and card players, male and female,&#xD;
with the exception of the hostess, who,&#xD;
feigning an excuse to her guests, had&#xD;
retired to her boudoir to seek consola-&#xD;
tion from  the pangs of a .wounded&#xD;
vanity.&#xD;
"Mr. Last," said the stranger Dela-&#xD;
more, "I have been searching for you."&#xD;
"You, again," returned the bootmak-&#xD;
er, abruptly ; "what do you want I"&#xD;
Christopher surveyed his interrogator&#xD;
with a look of contempt, intermingled,'&#xD;
however, with some expression of dread,&#xD;
for there was an occult influence exert-&#xD;
ed by the man over tht mind of the me-&#xD;
chanic, which at times disconcerted the&#xD;
most sagacious of his resolutions.&#xD;
"I come on the part of my esteemed&#xD;
friend Mr. 1arcy," said the stranger,&#xD;
while Mr. Marcy bowed at mention of&#xD;
his name, "to lay before you for con-&#xD;
sideration a most important proposi-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"A most important proposition !" re-&#xD;
peated the mechanic.&#xD;
"I am fully aware," resumed Dela-&#xD;
more, "that my friend, unaware of her&#xD;
relations, has been guilty of several&#xD;
wrongs, or errors of judgment with re-&#xD;
gard to Miss Genevieve; but should that&#xD;
gentleman, connected with many of the&#xD;
first families of the State, present him-&#xD;
self to demand her hand in marriage,&#xD;
do you not think that he has extended&#xD;
to her the reparation worthy of a gen-&#xD;
tleman, repentant of his prior indiscre-&#xD;
tions ?"&#xD;
"I refuse the proposition," said Chris-&#xD;
topher decisively-" the hand of Gene-&#xD;
vieve has been already promised to a&#xD;
capable man."&#xD;
"To whom has she been affianced?"&#xD;
demanded Delamore.&#xD;
"To Doctor Stephen Morand," re-&#xD;
sponded the mechanic.&#xD;
"To me ?" said the young physician&#xD;
inquiringly, while the crowd evidenced&#xD;
their astonishment by a series of half-&#xD;
suppressed murmurs.&#xD;

"To Doctor Morand?" ejaculated Do-&#xD;

"No, sir," said Christopher. "Gene-'&#xD;
vieve will be married as I have inform-&#xD;
ed you."&#xD;
"She shall marry," shouted Dela-&#xD;
more furiously, "as I desire-do you&#xD;
unerstand that?"&#xD;
"By what authority," inquired the&#xD;
shoemaker, blandly, "do you base your&#xD;
mandate ?"&#xD;
"I am perfectly acquainted with the&#xD;
sovereignty you exercise over her,"&#xD;
quoth Delamore. "I am aware that you&#xD;
have found the child upon the inanimate&#xD;
body of an unfortunate female ; I am&#xD;
aware that since that day you have de-&#xD;
voted to her every species of paternal&#xD;
care, for which you will be well paid ;&#xD;
nevertheless,1owever devoted you have&#xD;
shown yourself, you are not after all but&#xD;
her guardian-mind my words, guard-&#xD;

The bootmaker looked upon the&#xD;
speaker with a species of astonishment,&#xD;
for he appreciated the truth of all he&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"aMy respected friend," whispered the&#xD;
stranger in a low tone of voice, " I am&#xD;
the father of that interesting child !"&#xD;
"The father of Genevieve," quoth the&#xD;
terrified Christopher; "how say you!&#xD;
Are you the father of my angelic child?"&#xD;
"To-morrow, sir," said Delamore, "I&#xD;
will be at your house with proofs to sub-&#xD;
stantiate my assertion-documents and&#xD;
writings."&#xD;
"Documents and writings !" repeated&#xD;
the artisan, astonished ; "to-morrow,&#xD;
then, I will meet you at my house -&#xD;
hence be sure to bring all your proofs&#xD;
with you."&#xD;
"Yes, to-morrow!" replied Delamore;&#xD;
and the words rang through the arti-&#xD;

when, having gained his own abode and&#xD;
fung himself upon his couch for rest&#xD;
after an unaccustomed night's excite-&#xD;

Before his eyes constantly hovered the&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
IMPOSTURE.&#xD;
"What means this mysterious com-&#xD;
munication, and who can be its author?&#xD;
Stephen the acknowledged lover of an&#xD;
operatic singer. No--no ! it cannot be&#xD;
possible ; for if he could condescend to&#xD;
love a woman of that stamp, I never&#xD;
could love him."&#xD;
The bootmaker's adopted daughter&#xD;
sat in the little parlor over the shop,&#xD;
holding in her hands the mysterious&#xD;
epistle which nad given her so much&#xD;
vexation and annoyance. Vainly she&#xD;
endeavored to identify the handwriting&#xD;
-ineffectually she attempted to eradi-&#xD;
cate the impression the perusal of its&#xD;
contents had created. The heart of the&#xD;
young girl was pained ; and conviction&#xD;
as to her lover's falsity usurped full&#xD;
possession of a mind struggling to ex-&#xD;
tenuate presumptive infidelity.&#xD;
-1f, however, it should not prove&#xD;
true," quoth Genevieve to herself for&#xD;
the sixteenth time,when the door open-&#xD;
ed and her meditations were broken&#xD;
by the entrance of her aristocratic&#xD;
neighbor, the judge's lady.&#xD;
"Mrs. Littleton !" ejaculated Gene-&#xD;
vieve, astonished at so proud a visitor&#xD;
condescending to honor their abode with&#xD;
her presence.&#xD;
"My child !" quoth the lady kindly,&#xD;
&#xD;
although in evident perturbation- of&#xD;
spirit, "where is your father-I must&#xD;
see him immediately, for I wish to-con.&#xD;
verse with him."&#xD;
"My father ?" responded the young&#xD;
girl ; "I will call him for you."&#xD;
Leaving the lady, the young woman&#xD;
courteously summoned her parent, who,&#xD;
apprised of the presence of his neigh-&#xD;
bor, immediately hastened to ascertain&#xD;
the reason of her presence.&#xD;
"Mrs. Littleton !" ejaculated Christo-&#xD;
pher, astonished at her unexpected visit&#xD;
and observing a flush of excitement&#xD;
mantling over a countenance naturally&#xD;
placid and marble-like.&#xD;
"You have sent for me, Mr. Last,"&#xD;
said the judge's lady, as she cast her&#xD;
glances around the little parlor, as well&#xD;
to assure herself of being be, enad the&#xD;
reach of eavesdroppers as of being con-&#xD;
fident of Genevieve's departure; "your&#xD;
message alluded to your'having receiv-&#xD;
ed some intelligence to communicate. I&#xD;
have hastened hither with all -possible&#xD;
speed. Pray what is it?"'&#xD;
The lady paused, breathless with ex-&#xD;
citement.&#xD;
"Madam," responded the bootmaker,&#xD;
with equal precautions against possibi-&#xD;
lity of surprise, "it is a Serious matter,&#xD;
which requires the exercise of courage&#xD;
and energy."&#xD;
"Great heavens!" exclaimed the lady,&#xD;
turning red and pale alternately, as the&#xD;
blood mounted to her cheeks, "has any-&#xD;
thing happened to Genevieve, that you&#xD;
in this wise terrify me ?"&#xD;
"No. Still she is menaced with dan-&#xD;
ger !" replied the artisan, whose rug-&#xD;
ged features appeared equally pallid&#xD;
with the lady's.&#xD;
"Danger !" repeated Mrs. Littleton,&#xD;
hysterically.&#xD;
"In the first place, madam," resumed&#xD;
Christopher, in a tone ofthesitancy, "her&#xD;
father is still living !"&#xD;
"Her father !" retorted the lady, with&#xD;
an air of incredulity.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BOOT MAKER OF THE, FIFTH AVENUE.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Yes, her father - Herbert Vane !" s&#xD;
reasserted the mechanic.&#xD;
"That is impossible !" responded the&#xD;
judge's lady, with an air of decision-&#xD;
"the report of his death has reached&#xD;
evenhHere ; and it was only on confir-&#xD;
mation of that disastrous news that II&#xD;
yielded to the solicitations of my father&#xD;
and became the wife of the Hons. Mr.&#xD;
Littleton. Of this I can safely assure l&#xD;
you."                        f&#xD;
"Your information ias been false 1"&#xD;
rejoined the artisan emphatically, yet&#xD;
respectfully. "Herbert Vane is here in&#xD;
this very city. I have seen him this&#xD;
very day, and exhibited convincing&#xD;
proofs of his identity. I am as sure of&#xD;
his being the father of Genevieve as I&#xD;
am of my own existence. It is beyond&#xD;
doubt, madam."&#xD;
"0, my God, can this be true!" quoth&#xD;
the lady, balancing, between grief and&#xD;
joy, and half distracted by conflicting&#xD;
emotions. "Does he yet live, my Her-&#xD;
bert, joy of my heart, light of my soul?"&#xD;
."And, continued the bootmaker, with-&#xD;
out paying attention to the interrup-&#xD;
tion, "it behooves you to see him, to&#xD;
converse with him, madam; for he is&#xD;
about to bargain away the hand of your&#xD;
daughter to a bankrupt, a roue, a liber-&#xD;
tine, a man named Marcy, notorious for&#xD;
his debaucheries, his debts and his scan-&#xD;
dals; and yet to ihis miserable repro-&#xD;
bate, this social outcast, Herbert Vane&#xD;
has agreed to bestow his daughter in&#xD;
marriage."&#xD;
"It is impossible ! " exclaimed the&#xD;
lady, with evident signs of aversion to&#xD;
the idea-"No, sir ; Herbert Vane was&#xD;
too noble, too chivalrio a man to make&#xD;
such a choice. He is too lofty a soul,&#xD;
too proud a spirit to jeopardise the ft-&#xD;
tare of his child. No, sir. I repeat,&#xD;
Herbert Vane is too honest a man to be&#xD;
guilty of suchconduct, so unnatural, so&#xD;
heartless in the extreme."&#xD;
"He may have been such fifteen years&#xD;
&#xD;
ince," remarked the bootmake feel-&#xD;
ngly ; "hut it may chance that his tra-&#xD;
vois and a vagrant course of life oan&#xD;
have changed his heart."&#xD;
"If he has sanctioned this marriage,"&#xD;
observed the lady, warmly, " H.rbcrt&#xD;
has been the dupe of some designing&#xD;
villain !"&#xD;
"Well, madam," responded Christo-&#xD;
pher, despondently, "it may be as you&#xD;
say. You may have the power to unde-&#xD;
ceive him; but it is beyond my persua-&#xD;
sion, my prayers to alter the determi-&#xD;
nation of that austere and domineering&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"O, heavens, whatcan I do?" mur-&#xD;
mured the lady.&#xD;
"Your tears, your exhortations and&#xD;
entreaties," interposed the mechanic&#xD;
tenderly, "Inay melt thathoart of stone.&#xD;
If he ever loved yqu dearly, as you sup-&#xD;
pose, he cannot view the sad spectacle&#xD;
of your sorrow without relenting from&#xD;
his design."&#xD;
"Yes, yes," enthusiastically exclaim-&#xD;
ed the judge's lady, "I will see him-I&#xD;
will pray to him-I will sue for his par-&#xD;
don. Bitter as must be the pain of our&#xD;
meeting, and degraded as will regard&#xD;
the mother of his child, may God wit-&#xD;
ness, I must see him !"&#xD;
"In that case compose yourself," said&#xD;
the bootmaker, blandly. "I have sent&#xD;
for him, and he will be here in. a brief&#xD;
space of time."&#xD;
"Here 7" inquired the Hon. Mrs. Lit-&#xD;
tleton in great agitation.&#xD;
"Yes, here, in this very chamber,"&#xD;
replied Christopher.&#xD;
"And so promptly," ejaculated the&#xD;
lady nervously.&#xD;
"The hour is at hand,"-urged the ar-&#xD;
tisao, "have courage."&#xD;
"I have faith in God's will," respond-&#xD;
ed the lady, nerving herself to the con-&#xD;
templated task. "To meet after fifteen&#xD;
years of cruel separation, it is a fearful&#xD;
thought. To contemplate a criminal&#xD;

and to realize the anguish of a sacrificed&#xD;
happiness."&#xD;
The lady paced the parlor with hur-&#xD;
ried strides as her speech became more&#xD;
and more incoherent, as the indistinct&#xD;
outlines of a future came before her&#xD;
imagination, threatening annihilation of&#xD;
her hopes. Yet the idea of rescuing&#xD;
Genevieve from a certain ignominy,&#xD;
came to the assistance of maternal af-&#xD;
fection, and the mother gained strength&#xD;
to vindicate her child.&#xD;
"0, God !" exclaimed the judge's:&#xD;
wife, as the tears of bitterness rolled&#xD;
down her cheeks, "give me fortitude to&#xD;
risk this trial. Herbert, I have never&#xD;
wronged or deceived you. But," she&#xD;
added, with a deep drawn sigh, will&#xD;
he belheve my protestations '&#xD;
"Madame, he is here."&#xD;
As the bootmaker spoke, he threw&#xD;
wide the entrance door of his parlor,&#xD;
through which stalked, with well-as-&#xD;
sumed dignity, the athletic form of De-&#xD;
lamore, habited in a rich and over-ela-&#xD;
borated walking costume.&#xD;
As he passed the portal, Mrs. Little-&#xD;
ton rushed ferishly towards the figure&#xD;
of him whom she had in years gone by&#xD;
so enthusiastically and unwisely loved.&#xD;
"Herbert !" exclaimed the lady, fling-&#xD;
ing herself into his arms, but after east-&#xD;
ing a glance upon his countenance, she&#xD;
drew back in ill-disguised dismay -&#xD;
"who is this man I"&#xD;
"Who?" said the bootmaker, in per-&#xD;
plexity, 'is it not ----"&#xD;
"Again I demand !" said the lady,&#xD;
with augmenting energy, as her eyes&#xD;
flashed fire, "who is this minn?"&#xD;
"This man," replied the stranger,with&#xD;
coolness and deliberation, is a gentle-&#xD;
man, who has the honor of being Hu-&#xD;
bert Vane."&#xD;
"You Herbert Vane!" responded the&#xD;
lady, contemptuously.&#xD;
"Doubtlessly, madam," rejoined the&#xD;
stranger, austerely.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You are an imposter, " quoth the&#xD;
judge's wife, decisively.&#xD;
"That is a grave accusation," re-&#xD;
marked Delamore.&#xD;
"And, nevertheless, most true," add-&#xD;
ed Mrs. Littleton.&#xD;
"Who dares make such a charge&#xD;
against me?" inquired Delamore, be-&#xD;
stowing a contemptuous smile on his&#xD;
accuser.&#xD;
"I do," said th judge's lady, defiant-&#xD;
ly, "and I public  declare and will ever&#xD;
maintain that you are neither Hubert'&#xD;
Vane nor the father of the girl known&#xD;
to us as Genevieve." i&#xD;
"Take care, my honorable and re-&#xD;
spected lady,'' retorted the stranger,&#xD;
with malignant emphasis upon his&#xD;
words, "there is but one living being in&#xD;
this wide world who could sustain so&#xD;
sweeping and definite an assertion; and&#xD;
that being is the woman who rejoices as&#xD;
having been the mother of the found-&#xD;
ling."&#xD;
Mrs. Littleton sighed audibly ; for in&#xD;
this semi-enigmatical threat, sufficient&#xD;
was conveyed to show that she was in&#xD;
the power of the stranger were she com-&#xD;
pelled to avow the secret of the girl's&#xD;
nativity, which had been concealed for&#xD;
so many years, and was now in the&#xD;
keeping of a dissolute adventurer.&#xD;
"The Hon. Mrs. Littleton," resumed&#xD;
Delamore, in a careless manner of&#xD;
speech, "was originally, ~if I believe&#xD;
rightly, a Miss Henrietta Desmond."&#xD;
"Lost!" ejaculated the lady, as a cold&#xD;
shudder passed over her entire frame-&#xD;
then reassuming courage, she continued;&#xD;
in her ordinary tone of voice, as the&#xD;
stranger smiled at her agitation.&#xD;
"I am ignorant, sir," she said indig-&#xD;
nantly, "as to what interest you have&#xD;
in the contemplated marriage of Gene-&#xD;
vieve ?"&#xD;
"' A. very great interest, indeed," re-&#xD;
sponded Delamore grimly-"in fact, it&#xD;
can be with difficulty computed in del&#xD;
lars and cents."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Neither, ca I compass the design,"&#xD;
resumedrj4lh14 dy, growing more and&#xD;
more collected as she progressed in her&#xD;
harangue,.'"which you have in exhum-&#xD;

"Never, sir, never !" quoth the lady,&#xD;
in a decided manner.&#xD;
"But how can you prevent it ?" in-&#xD;
qufrd Delamore, with a threatening&#xD;
expression of cou;itenance ; " I have it&#xD;
Within my power to reclaim this child&#xD;
which is aeuied to you. Reflect, I en-&#xD;
treat of you, upon the delicacy of your&#xD;
"But should I refuse to surrender her&#xD;
up '' said Mr. Littleton. ,&#xD;
"Yes, if we should'refuso to :give her&#xD;
up ?" chimed in the bootmaker.&#xD;
"Then, madam," replied the-adven-&#xD;
turerer, boldly and haughtily, "since&#xD;
time has effected such changes in my&#xD;
features as not to be recognizable in&#xD;
your eyMe, it may not have wrought the&#xD;
same -wonder on my parchments and&#xD;
documentary evidences,which this gen-&#xD;
tleman has already viewed. In a word,&#xD;
I shall be compelled to resort to law to&#xD;
enforce my rights."&#xD;
"Your rights ?" inquired Mrs. Little-&#xD;
ton, astounded at the imposter's con-&#xD;
tinued assumption of another's charac-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
"Yes, madam, my rights'!" repeated&#xD;
Delamore, with a vigorous demonstra-&#xD;
tion, of energy. By the -way, before&#xD;
your husband, the judge, must come the&#xD;
investigation of my pretensions-so you&#xD;
see that it will be a purely family-mat-&#xD;

&#xD;
"This is most iniquitous," muttered&#xD;
the lady, sorely vexed at the idea of&#xD;
having her first fault reviewed by a de-&#xD;
ceived husband, from whom knowledge&#xD;
of the past had been cautiously con-&#xD;
cealed.&#xD;
"Yes, madam, to your husband," con-&#xD;
tinued Delamore, in a menacing man-&#xD;
ner, "I will remit proofs of my pater-&#xD;
nity. And will you dare-contest them?&#xD;
Will you have the hardihood of pre-&#xD;
senting yourself before your liege lord&#xD;
and declare to him that I nor any other&#xD;
man is not the father of your child °"&#xD;
"Pity-for heaven's sake, have pity&#xD;
on me !" and the aristocratic lady threw&#xD;
herself upon her knees to implore mercy&#xD;
from the persecutor-"break not the&#xD;
heart cf a fond, a doating, sorrow-&#xD;
stricken mother ! I plead pardon not&#xD;
for my own sake, but that of my child !&#xD;
Listen to me, and have mercy on the&#xD;
weakness of my sex !"&#xD;
"My faith is pledged, madam," quoth&#xD;
Delamore, with vindictive-animosity -&#xD;
"Genevieve must marry Marcy !"&#xD;
"Your heart is then steeled a ainst&#xD;
our prayers," again pleaded the judge's&#xD;
{ lady, "and there is no other means to&#xD;
avert shame and ruin ?"&#xD;
"And do you not tremble, least you&#xD;
may find some honest man," interposed&#xD;
Christopher, advancing to the imposter,&#xD;
"who may crush you out of existence&#xD;
like a venomous beast-like a-"&#xD;
"I fear nothing, my chivalric' boot-&#xD;
maker," returned Delamore, with a look&#xD;
of supreme disdain, "and least of all&#xD;
from you."&#xD;
"We'll see about that," responded the&#xD;
artisan.&#xD;
"The law protects me," resumed the&#xD;
stranger. "Now, madam, in an hour&#xD;
hence I will return for your definite&#xD;
answer."&#xD;
The man of mystery folded his arms,&#xD;
and sting a keen but galling glance,&#xD;
strode rapidly from the apartment,&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
CONFESSIONS OF TILE HEART.&#xD;
"Mother-my mother ! and the privi-&#xD;
lege de::ied me of outspeaking my heart&#xD;
to her who gave ie birth. Why should&#xD;
she blush for me even if I have been&#xD;
the offspring of love. But I will save&#xD;
her from further shame, for she has suf-&#xD;
fered too deeply '"&#xD;
While Mrs. Littleton was pacing the&#xD;
apartment, lost in the contemplation of&#xD;
the distressing events hourly compli-&#xD;
cating around her, the fair and gentle&#xD;
Genevieve noiselessly entered the little&#xD;
parlor of the artisan, and watched her&#xD;
parent's actions in the deepest of solici-&#xD;
tude. Her resolution was instantly&#xD;
taken.&#xD;
"What ails thee, my dear child?"&#xD;
murmured Mrs. Littleton, as she clasp-&#xD;
ed Genevieve to her bosom, noticing&#xD;
that the young girl was pale, trembling&#xD;
and melancholy; "why have you cause&#xD;
for tears'? Come, tell your poor mo-&#xD;
ther, who should weep for two."&#xD;
"1I have at this moment no cause for&#xD;
tears," quoth Genevieve, affectionately&#xD;
casting a loving glance upon her parent&#xD;
-"on the contrary, this appears the&#xD;
brightest moment in my existence."&#xD;
"You have doubtlessly received some&#xD;
tidings of Dr. Morand 7" inquired the&#xD;
lady, endeavoring to compose her agi-&#xD;
tation.&#xD;
"No, no, madam, it is not upon that&#xD;
account," replied the girl.&#xD;
"Nevertheless, you love him," re-&#xD;
marked Mrs. Littleton, feelingly ; "and&#xD;
must be delighted at the near approach&#xD;
of your -marriage."&#xD;
"That marriage willnever take place,"&#xD;
rejoined the maiden, with more than&#xD;
ordinary warmth of speech, as her eyes&#xD;
sparkled in intensity of will, "I have&#xD;
no desire to be the bride of Dr. Mu-&#xD;
rand."&#xD;
And upon what account ?" question-&#xD;
ed the mother, anxiously.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Because he loves another," replied&#xD;
Genevieve, curtly.&#xD;
"But who has told you this?" inter-&#xD;
rogated the judge's lady.&#xD;
"I am aware of it," observed the girl,&#xD;
evidencing that strong will and mature&#xD;
deliberation distinguishing an inde-&#xD;
pendent character  "my resolution is&#xD;
taken, and I will not marry him !"&#xD;
"Have a care, .my child," cautiously.&#xD;
interposed the parent, as she caressed&#xD;
her I eloved; "take not a step for which&#xD;
you will have cause for regret hereaf-&#xD;
ter-act with caution and reflection."&#xD;
"I have done so, mother," quoth the&#xD;
girl, bending her head for consolation&#xD;
on her parent's bosom; "I have thought&#xD;
over the matter more than once-I have&#xD;
weighed my future and yours ; and for&#xD;
very good reasons I am determined to&#xD;
adhere to my choice."&#xD;
"And pray, dear, what are these rea-&#xD;
sons?" inquired the mother, with a smile&#xD;
of precaution, "what have wrought so&#xD;
wondrous a change in the affections of&#xD;
youth ?"&#xD;
"Think not, mother, that I regret the&#xD;
step," responded Genevieve, exhibiting&#xD;
a sagacity and penetration far beyond&#xD;
her years; " on the contrary, I have&#xD;
scarcely known Stephen for the past&#xD;
three years. That I loved him, it is&#xD;
true ; but that for which I loved him,&#xD;
was his honesty,his courage under diffi-&#xD;
culties, his energy during privations,&#xD;
and his unquenchable: thirst for knowl-&#xD;
edge. But the possession of money de-&#xD;
stroyed every one of these virtues. It&#xD;
has breathed into his soul egotism, cor-&#xD;
ruption, selfishness and vanity. Mad-&#xD;
am, I could never love such a man as he&#xD;
has turned to be.'!&#xD;
"And has your father knowledge of&#xD;
this resolution ?"&#xD;
"No, madam."&#xD;
"What wi.l the good man think?" said&#xD;
Mrs. Littleton, "who has battled so en-&#xD;
ergetically against every obstacle, and&#xD;

" Against the impulses of his own&#xD;
heart !" uttered Genevieve, in wonder.&#xD;
"1Yes, Genevieve," responded her&#xD;
mother, gravely, "this honest artisan,&#xD;
who has nurtured and brought you up,&#xD;
viewed your progress toward woman-&#xD;
hood with admiration. He regarded&#xD;
with the affection a parent bestows upon&#xD;
a child ; then little by little the value&#xD;
of that love changed - secretly he&#xD;
adores you as a suitor!"&#xD;
"My poor father!" ejaculated the,&#xD;
young girl, despite herself.&#xD;
"One day," resumed Mrs. Littleton,&#xD;
"he went to you to unburden his heart;&#xD;
then he learned that youloved another.&#xD;
The worthy man stifled the knowledge&#xD;
of his secret within himself, and wiped&#xD;
away his tears with self-sacrificing re-&#xD;
solution; for he said to himself-what&#xD;
matters how much I suffer if Genevieve&#xD;
be happy."&#xD;
"Noble and generous friend !" mur-&#xD;
mured the young girl; "and I to be ig-&#xD;
norant of all this. Alas, how many&#xD;
hours of care and of vexation may I have&#xD;
caused him! But, mother, know that&#xD;
in forgetting Stephen, I have made&#xD;
another choico,which may please him."&#xD;
"Another choice?" inquired Mrs. Lit-&#xD;
tleton, nervously.&#xD;
"I have set my choice upon a man ;"&#xD;
and Genevieve blushed deeply, "who&#xD;
loves me; for he has told me he does-"&#xD;
"And who is that man 1' interrupted&#xD;
her mother.&#xD;
"Mr. Marcy."&#xD;
"Mr. Marcy!" repeated the lady; "the&#xD;
thing is impossible. Genevieve, you&#xD;
are imposed upon."&#xD;
"No, madam, I assure you ---"&#xD;
"You have been imposed upon, Ge-&#xD;
nevieve," repeated the lady energeti-&#xD;
cally ; "I appreciate your conduct, my&#xD;
dearest girl-you, would immolate your-&#xD;
self to save my reputation."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Do not believe it to be so," sobbed&#xD;
the maiden.&#xD;
"Deceive me not,Genevieve," resum-&#xD;
ed Mrs. Littleton, with augmented ve-&#xD;
hemence - "you are about to sacri-&#xD;
fice yourself; for, alas! you have learn-&#xD;
ed the name of your mother !"&#xD;
"My mother !" and Genevieve vainly&#xD;
endeavored to dissemble. "Madam, I&#xD;
do not thoroughly comprehend your&#xD;
meaning."&#xD;
"And yet you tremble, you weep !"&#xD;
retorted the lady, smilingly. "0, Gene-&#xD;
vieve, will you persist in denial, when&#xD;
these arms are open for thy reception?&#xD;
Feel you not the mandates of nature I',&#xD;
"Mother-dearest mother ! You are&#xD;
indeed my mother !" and the young&#xD;
girl, overpowered by emotions, threw&#xD;
herself, half insensible, half frantic, into&#xD;
the open arms of her newiy-found rela-&#xD;
tive.&#xD;
"My daughter, my dearest daughter!"&#xD;
quoth the lady, as she embraced the&#xD;
lovely girl ; "well worthy are you of&#xD;
my love; for the first action, upon dis-&#xD;
covering the secret of your birth, was&#xD;
to devote yourself to her salvation. But&#xD;
I will not sanction so lofty a sacrifice&#xD;

"And, madam, how are you to pre-&#xD;

Mother and daughter started at hear-&#xD;

as the croak of the raven. It was the&#xD;
voice of D-lamore, who had glided si-&#xD;

moment of distraction which followed'&#xD;
the recognition of paternal relations.&#xD;
"Prevent it !" ejaculated the judge's&#xD;
lady, nerved to desperation, "easily.&#xD;
You have threatened to lay your case&#xD;

tropolitan policemen in their uniforms ;&#xD;
while the rear was brought up by Ni-&#xD;
cholas Strap, who apparently enjoyed&#xD;
the scene with the relish of his master.&#xD;

pointing to the culprit, " this man has&#xD;
signed his confession of being an im-&#xD;

for the police to manacle and carry off&#xD;

for the first time in his life !" And the&#xD;
apprentice resumed his dance of joy.&#xD;
"Yes, Nicholas," responded the me-&#xD;
chanic, affectionately, "the mission of&#xD;
my life has been accomplished. May&#xD;
you, Nicholas, now that your appren-&#xD;
ticeship has ceased, meet with equal&#xD;
happiness. Remember, it remains with&#xD;
yourself to make yourself worthy, like&#xD;
me, of having been a BOOTMAKER.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE END.&#xD;
