A VISION.&#xD;
Ninety years ago ! What a short period in the annals of the world, ai yet-&#xD;
how fraught with changes for the fair region now'know  to the geogtapher  s&#xD;
Beavet county. Where'-schools and churches, vihere n is and factories, falms *&#xD;
and'villages now abound, ninety yars ago dptevein thevestige of a buying&#xD;
wasto e sen.The river had not been dnmdo-spanned ; the  eious&#xD;
coal bed had not been tapped,, nor the fertile field:cleared. Indeed, dnrb rand&#xD;
unbroken forest stretched from one end of the county to 'the other, and inste~d&#xD;
of the civilized white man,'the dusky Indian, the greedy wolf, the bloodithirs{y&#xD;
panther, anid the awkward.bear, thinly popdiated its sonibre~hills aid vallyp&#xD;
Yet it- was by no. means void of be uty only that this beauty in many places&#xD;
was of a serious, almost austere character. Through the dense foliagoig i&#xD;
giant trees, and the denser one of its undergrowth , few sun rafs pund their&#xD;
cheering way, leaving fit haunts fon poisonous serpents and beasts of prey un&#xD;
derneath ; but where rivers, creeks and runs intercepted the green canopy, the&#xD;
aspect was cheering enough. True, even here the forest strove for mastery,&#xD;
sending mighty-tree tops obliquely over the vater, or causing dense bushes to&#xD;
hang festoon-like into the -clear flood ; but the sun lit up the foliage to the&#xD;
brightness of burnished gold, and there was always enough of the limpid mir-&#xD;
ror left'to reflect the Azure of the sky, Ves, the Water courses of the country -&#xD;
were t -en lbeautiful, more beautiful'tliah now; 'for no ugly darn had as yet di&#xD;
turbed 1 re ffppling current, or the inipetuous cascades of the rapids. Bridges&#xD;
and mill dams are practical improvement adapted to facilitate the  intercourse&#xD;
and serve the purposes of inan, but hardly calculated to'enhance the beauty of&#xD;
the scene. Methinks I yould gladly give a day of my life for the privilege ot&#xD;
-spending another on the waters and the banks of the Beaver, river- as it appear-,&#xD;
ed ninety years ago. I would, however,, hadly fancy meeting the 'dusky savr  l.&#xD;
age that was then creeping alongdft bushy banks, following the trail of his vi-&#xD;
tim with unerring certainty, and driving the tomahawk into its skull withqt&#xD;
the;wariing of a'mdinent. Tlose were perilous tines for thesolitary pale-faee&#xD;
wanaidrr, and none but men of"nerves; strong sinesx s, acute senses, and great&#xD;
experience in the use of the rifle an4 the ways of the wilderness, could venture&#xD;
in-with'ahy prospectof returning&#xD;
The two men we see wendirngth'eir Way up-ithe left bank of Seaver creek seem&#xD;
to be of that character. They are evidently backwoodsmen, or rangers, wear&#xD;

ing th  parel ot'that, class, which consisted If a hunting frock, Indian leggings'&#xD;
nd  6I*Eoasins. While the frock of the older and smaller of the ,wo is made of&#xD;
plain linsey, that ofhis younger companion consists of tanned deer skin, and&#xD;
makes some pretensions to taste and neatness. His leggins also, are fringed&#xD;
more profusely, and his whole suit looks as though its owner was thinking a&#xD;
_.   little about his appearance, or as if it had but lately left the hands of one skilled&#xD;
in the art of tailoring. Agur cap sat neatly upon a mass of auburn curls, and&#xD;
the upper lip of the handsome, though sunburnt face, sported a short moustache&#xD;
in so saucy a manner that the young hunter would hae done-credit to the parked*&#xD;
of an eatern city. ,On the other hand, however, one need only notice his elas-  I&#xD;
tiq, =doisoess stepias keef, penetrating glance, that seems-to take in and un-&#xD;
d 4stnnd the whole surroundings with the rapidity of lightning, and the ease&#xD;
anc skill with vhich lQ poised the'heady rifle on his left arm, while the right&#xD;
'hard keeps in the neighborhood of the lock ready for emergencies; we need only&#xD;
sedftll this to kno . a  nce thaif the youth would grace the city, he is.at home&#xD;
in the&amp;amp;$rest.&#xD;
Hissenior is a man of smaller, but very compact build;) one of those persons it&#xD;
whole strength we are v ery apt to underrate. *They have little flesh, but con-&#xD;
si4rable muscle and sinew, a bocy which is best qualified by the epithet of&#xD;
wirf; H   bronzed face has an honest expression and regular features, which  i'&#xD;
possgs as much comeliness as constant exposure to the weather, several ugly&#xD;
- scars and the age of fort-five will allow. We guess him to be that old, though&#xD;
such' fac&amp;amp; as his are by no means tell-tale faces, while his companion can, in&#xD;
our estimation, scarcely have passed his twenty-third year. The- smaller man,&#xD;
however, seems not only older in years but also in experience; for he takes the&#xD;
lead, his companion modestly walking in his footsteps and listening attentively1&#xD;
to his words, without neglecting to use his own senses at the Same time.&#xD;
"It is as it is, Bob," the leading man said, in a guarded undertone, "and&#xD;
your disputin' it can't alter it, nohow; them critters are, to say the least, made&#xD;
}of tarnation bad stuff. An inch is an inch, and a Delaware hardly better nor&#xD;
another. { Don't talk to me about your j5oor injured Indian! all they're fit for&#xD;
is to be shot down, and no mistake."&#xD;
"That is the general opinion here, Dave, I am well aware; but I cannot help&#xD;
thinking that the'pase might have been different if the red men had always been&#xD;
treated right. You can't deny now, that he has not always been dealt with, as&#xD;
justicee would dictate, can you?"&#xD;
" Well, I don't khow. I gugss you hint at the land question; but even there 3&#xD;
"  ain'4treparedto knock under. It ain't meet that them red devils should rove&#xD;
over sich wild tracts of land when white men apt w'em for better purposes..We&#xD;
need corn, and wheat anl terbacker, and you never saw the red man thatwould&#xD;
stoop to 'cultivatin' did you?"&#xD;
"No, David; but-it strikes me you don't like it much better. I have often,&#xD;
heard you curse the plough and those that handle it and turn these fine forests'&#xD;
into fields and meadows. How do you explain this?"&#xD;
&#xD;
_ '-&#xD;
&#xD;
Such logic being-irrefutable, the other kept his peace, but could not help smil-&#xD;
ing, a manifestation wholly innocent, as his comrade marched with his back to-&#xD;
wad him. It is imipossible to state what~ turn the conversation would have'&#xD;
taken, for it was interrupted, and that, too, in a manner wh %caused the kwo&#xD;
frontiersmen to seek the cover of a tree and keep their rifled  dy for immediate&#xD;
execution. The cause of this alarm was a noise emanating on their right, and .&#xD;
approaching them with a.recklessness truly'startling four such a precarious time&#xD;
and place. It sounded like some human being or heavy animal breaking thro'&#xD;
bushes or other obstacles in the way, with',a total disregard to secresy or safety&#xD;
and our hunters might have indulged in wondering calculations if the unknown&#xD;
being had not approached'with such.great rapidity. Five seconds had hardly&#xD;
elapsed since the first hearing of the noise, when a fine stag made his appear-&#xD;
ance, and with one tremendous bound, precipitated himself from the steep bank&#xD;
into the clear water below. It just' rtched to his side, and half walking, half&#xD;
swimming, the stag, endeavored to gain the opposite shore.4&#xD;
" What a fine animal," said the young man who had been called Robei# by&#xD;
his companion.. " Might we not as well kill him, and secure the good grace of&#xD;
our Indian friends by a savory morsel of venison?"&#xD;
" No, no, Bob,.don't shoot," the other exhorted. "A fellow never knows, in&#xD;
such ticklish times, what a bullet in the barrel may be good for. Besides we&#xD;
are too near their camp nqw to venture on so noisy a demonstration. I woul&#xD;
rather-but there it goes. It seems we ain't as much to ourselves here as 1&#xD;
would wish."&#xD;
" The buck is down," said Robert, "and there comes the lucky hunter :He,&#xD;
foi- one, don't seem afraid to show himself."&#xD;
On the other side of the stream the bushes parted and a young Indian made&#xD;
his appearance. The bank being low he stepped on the gr velly bar, where&#xD;
the stag was lying, and -in doing so. exposed a figure of much beauty and prom-&#xD;
ise. I say promise, because he did not seem to be much older than fourteen or&#xD;
fifteen years of age. Still his conduct foreshadowed already the coming War-&#xD;
rior; for in walking up to the deer he evinced a grace, dignity and self-pos=; =&#xD;
sion peculiar to the Indian,_especially when he knows himself the object .of bb&#xD;
servation. The young hunter had, of course, noticed the pale-faces on the op-&#xD;
posite bank; but instead of fearing them he seemed to be rather pleased with&#xD;
their sight. Placing his left foot on the dead stag, he, with his right hand,&#xD;
made a saluting gesture xihich could be intended for no one but the rngers4&#xD;
"That boy sees us," whispered Robert.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE W ID ROSE OF THE BEAVER                  5.&#xD;
The other' as slightly embarrassed. His case, however, adst ne,&#xD;
gut is one of the many1 where rights and privileges cannot be proven e +t by&#xD;
the strength of the owner. The forester argued in that strai&#xD;
"Well, I don't undertake to explain it," he said; "but I kdolv well -endgh&#xD;
that white ain't red, and that the white man wants these lands and is goin' to&#xD;
have them."&#xD;

somewhat sarcastically. " Howsumever, we may as well ask him."&#xD;
Upon this he stepped close to the bank and hailed the Indian, who might&#xD;
have been sixty yards off.&#xD;
"Say, youngster," he cried "we want to cross this river, and hate to wet our&#xD;
breeches; can you perchance accommodate us ivth a canoe?"&#xD;
The yquth evidently understood him, but before replying he turned his face&#xD;
towards the bushes behind him, as if expecting guidance from there. If so, his&#xD;
expectations were evidently realized, for nodding to the strangers he pointed to&#xD;
a bush at their feet,- which was hanging into the water. They were me accus-&#xD;
tomed to take hints and read signs. Looking over the 'bank they saw fo tprints&#xD;
evidently made in the effort'of climbing it.&#xD;
"Aha, I understand it now," David said to his companion. " Do you-see the&#xD;
canoe under the bush? One, f their party crossed the river by it'and stirred up&#xD;
the stag. He cannot be far off I'm sure, and though he is only an Injun, com-&#xD;
mon politeness requires us to wait. Hark! there he is now."&#xD;
It was even so. From the copse-wood lining the hill-side a young Indian&#xD;
warrior at this moment stepped to the open river bank, at a distance of'hardly a&#xD;
- dozen paces from-the white men. He was older than the boy on the bar, but&#xD;
hardly as old as the younger ranger. The exercise through which he had gone&#xD;
f seemed to have called into play all the muscles of'his body, and to have stirred"&#xD;
him from that reserve which has become the second nature of the red man.&#xD;
His eye gleamed, a joyous smile lay on his lips, and he seemed to shout to the&#xD;
boy on the other side. . But no sooner had his eye lit on the strangers an a&#xD;
change.came over him, almost magical in its effect. The motions of the body&#xD;
ceased and he became as immovsble as if he had been chiseled out of stone.&#xD;
-The face lost its excitement under a mask of perfect reserve, and only the eye,&#xD;
incapable of belying its habitual fire, shone upon the stranger'with an intense-&#xD;
ness.in which Robert imagined he saw the very essence of hatred. The older&#xD;
hunter Wow accosted the Indian.&#xD;
- Good day to you, sir," he said rather roughly, and with no desire to'conceal&#xD;
the contempt for the red man, which his former remarks have already betrayed&#xD;

to us. "I eckon this is your canoe; we mean to use it for the purpose ofcross-&#xD;
in' over. If you have the same notion you might as well come along."&#xD;
Instead of an answer the Indian dcended think and entering the canoe&#xD;
untied the cord with which it wad fa tened to a (fojectimg root. [folding on to&#xD;
the bush he looked at the strangers with an inviting gfance, but abstained from&#xD;
uttering a word.&#xD;
"LOumb like a fish," David muttered, half to himself, and half-to his compare&#xD;
ion. "I suppose our lamed Captain at the fort Vould call that mute illoquence#Y&#xD;
But we may As we,1l embark , without raiism ' ihe eflfow d ader. This'trip  f&#xD;

The Indiangraised his hand a'nd pointed to the forest ih their rear. When&#xD;
they turned to learn his nieanintleir eyes beheld a sight, equally strange and&#xD;
charming. On the second bank of the river, which rose aboutthree feetovker the&#xD;
I first,in one of the few apertures orihe leafy seam, that hemmed the water&#xD;
course for many a mile, stood the figure of a young Indian woman. Now our&#xD;
rargers'h1dsern nny an Indian wofanold and young, and the sight of such&#xD;
alone would certainly have created' no wonderment'of theirs, but'the young&#xD;
maiden standing there was, evidently no common apparition.&#xD;
As a general thing, beauty, in our sense o(the word, was a rare attribute of&#xD;
the Indian squaw- of North America. True 'she; in youth,, shared with the&#xD;
white wqman that beauty of form and grace of motion, that seems to be the iii-&#xD;
heritance- of the female sex the world over; but her features were generally&#xD;
coarse, the cheek bones projecting in a.striking manner.. Besides, her hair was&#xD;
coarse, and lacked that lustre, which forms such a charn in the Caucasiangi&#xD;
The maiden on the bank, however, formed an exception to the' rule,  ehf&#xD;
tirely free from he elects of her race, and her figure and features- form  an&#xD;
ensemble which would have created a sensation on the thronged buleva s gff&#xD;

8                THE WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVER.&#xD;
Paris. She stood there with the dignity of a queen, this dignity,.however, tern-&#xD;
perpd by the grace of her attitude and the sweet smile of a countenance, whose&#xD;
dark complexion was The only evidence of het origin. She was above medium&#xD;
sige; he face formed a beautiful oval framed by thick masses of waving hair&#xD;
that vied in blackness with the pl  age of the raven. Her skin, though dark,&#xD;
was clear and transparent, showi g the bloom on her cheek and the cherry,&#xD;
color of her lips. Her profile w  purely Grecian, and the most fastidious&#xD;
sculptor could have discovered no defectt in it. Her eyes were large, brilliant,&#xD;
atd yet moist, ofthat dreamy depth which reveals the corresponding nature of&#xD;
the virgin soul. Her graceful figure was ,well set off by the fantastic dress she&#xD;
wore. The frock or tunic in which her upper body was clad; consisted of doe-&#xD;
skin which hed been exquisitely tanned, and then dyed with a brilliant scarlet.&#xD;
It reached to the knees, and was drawn to the waist by an embroidered belt ofI&#xD;
yellow leather. The lower edge was trimmed with white fringe 'of the same&#xD;
material, and so were the leggins which shared the color of the belt. The&#xD;
small feet were encased in a neatly embroidered mode in, in which the scarlet&#xD;
of the frock \vas repeated,. showing that the Indian . auty did not only prize&#xD;
fine material andagraceful cut in ger apparel, but also understood the law of&#xD;
colors. A string of wampum around her neck and wrists, and a bunch of wild&#xD;
roses were the only ornaments she wore; but,-indeed, the eyes of the spectators&#xD;
missed neither gold or diamonds, and so lo vrful was the effect of her unex-&#xD;
pected appearance upon even the older hunter,'that he gazed fully a minute be-&#xD;
fore he collected sufficient composure to address her. As to the younger he&#xD;
gladly yielded to his companion the office of speaker, as this allowed him to&#xD;
continue feasting his enraptured vision upon charms he liked, which he thought&#xD;
.ever to have encountered before, which perhaps struck him with double force&#xD;
on account of the wild surroundings.&#xD;
When the elder scdt walked towards the'maiden and began t9 speak to h%,&#xD;
he showed none of that cntempt which had becomehabitual with him in his&#xD;
tercourse with Inlians. His tone and deportment showed on the contrary, a&#xD;
respect which would perhaps have struck him as ridiculous, if he had been fully&#xD;
conscious of it. He went even as far as to borrow, in a measure, the flowery&#xD;
speech which the Iudias use, but*whieh accorded so little with his general\&#xD;
blunt forwardness.&#xD;
" I see a gay bird in the woods," he addressed the girl," which I never no&#xD;
ticed before; what may be its name !"&#xD;
This was said in the Delaware tongue, but-was it for reasons of politeness&#xD;
or vanity-the maiden replied in tolerably correct English.        ,&#xD;
My pale-face father is very good: he may call his daughter the Wild Rose&#xD;
of the weaver Valley."-&#xD;
" T at is a pretty name; does mydaughter go by it?"&#xD;
'She only claims what, belongs to her; her tongue is not thievish like the&#xD;
magpie's, nor mischievous like the mocking bird's."&#xD;
&#xD;
f  Mir,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVER.,9&#xD;
"I reckon hot, and I shall therefo e ask the Wild Rosea few questions: Does&#xD;
she belong to the tribe of the Beaver that sojourns in this neighborhood?"&#xD;
" The Wild Rose is the old chief's daughter.&#xD;
." Ah! no wonder then you look like the princess of a fairy-tale. But see&#xD;
here, would you trouble yourself to show us the way to your fathers wigwam,&#xD;
and secure us a pleasant welcome?"&#xD;
"The Wild Rose will do as her' father wishes. She willtell the'young nen&#xD;
what to do, and then go with her pale-face friends."&#xD;
With these words she stepped to the young Indians who had remained :near&#xD;
the stag and been silent but attentivegvitnesses of the abote dialogue. Shead-&#xD;
dressed them in an undertone and although the older youth cast sinister glances&#xD;
from under his contracted brows at what he might consider intruders, he sub&#xD;
mitted without contradiction to the directions of the maiden.- Both youths be-&#xD;
gan to puff the venison towards the canoe, but when they calmto lining the&#xD;
dead carcass into the vessel, their united' strength seemed inadequate to the&#xD;
task, and the girl was on the point of aiding in the effort, when the younger&#xD;
scout with commend legeal sprang to their assistance. Bendinghis eye with&#xD;
undisguised admirati  upon the fair creaturer he cried eagerly:&#xD;
" Don't, don't! you'll surely hurt yourself. *This is no'*vork for such tender&#xD;
hands.. Come, lads, one good lift and the work is done. Steady! That's the&#xD;
style."&#xD;
When the stag was in the enoe, the two Indians shoved it into deeper water&#xD;
and began to push it up'stteam by means of pole and paddle. The maiden on&#xD;
the other hand-after casting a look'of grateful ackrdwledgement upon the young&#xD;
scout,' beckoned him and his companion to follow her. Sle 'took a northern&#xD;
direction following, the course of. the creek, but cuttingoff the many curves&#xD;
which it describes and succeeded in reaching the camp of her tribe at least half&#xD;
an hour in advance of the canoe. Little or nothing was spoken on the road&#xD;
her capacity as guide necessitating a position in front of;the hunters.&#xD;
When the party reached the outskirts of the 'vill ge, several sentinels were&#xD;
seen lounging about, and if alone, the white men night have found some diffi-&#xD;
culty in reaching the termination of their journey without molestation or at least&#xD;
delay. As it was however the presence of the maiden sufficed to clear the&#xD;
way. She was not even questioned, eider by thegentinels at the outskirts or&#xD;
by the groups of idling warriors they met and passed further in the centre. At&#xD;
last the girl stopped before a hut and turningto the scouts, said:&#xD;
"You stay here a little 'while, me call father."&#xD;
With these words she disappeared in the lodge and the scouts found time to&#xD;
satisfy a natural curiosity by looking around. This was no common Indian&#xD;
town built on the spur of the moment, nor where the houses recently put up.&#xD;
They were regular blockhouses, erected and afterwards abandoned by the&#xD;
Christian Indians. ' Mostof' them were much decayed, having been deserted&#xD;
for more than eight years, nor did the recent improvements appear to be of a&#xD;
very substantial nature. To cut clown, hew and square trees was too great 0&#xD;

task for Indian patience to be thougltof.; so instead of renewing the waiting!&#xD;
logs or missing shingles, the hoes a I dfrevices of the old buildings had been&#xD;
stopped up, and patched in a hurried and therefore careless penn er, though-&#xD;
may be, well enough to answer the purpose. Even in their decayed condition&#xD;
these'bloekhouses were stuper-ior to the general hapitations of the Indian, and&#xD;
Robert imagined to notice a more than usul dignity in the warriors, as. they&#xD;
walked in and out of their mansions or through the deserted streets, in Which&#xD;
shrubs, trees and grass had until recently struggled for the rrastery. St1,bis&#xD;
chance of observation was very short, for a minute hd hardly elapsedsince theK&#xD;
withdrawal of the maiden, when she -eappeared in company of a r anwhose&#xD;
appearance was as striking in one way, as hers in another. He was  fine spec-&#xD;
imen of the Indian chief, such as sketches and border tales, have brought his&#xD;
picture down to us. Although his hair began to, show streaks ofgray and&#xD;
more than fifty winters must have passed, over.his head, nothing in his appear-&#xD;
ance bett-ayed'signs of decliningcstrength, O the contrary, where the muscles&#xD;
and'sinews of his body were exposed, they told a tale of strength andpower of&#xD;
endurance, which made the thought of a hostile encounter with hin rather un-&#xD;
pleasant. PXit,more thani these signs of undiminished v4or did the noble dig-&#xD;
nified deportment, the pleasiiant smile of his well formed countenance and the&#xD;
great intelligence oflis egle'eyes impress his visitors. He waved his hand to&#xD;
them in token and then extending it to them for a grasp and a pressure, he said&#xD;
in broken English, w hich was hardly as good ashthat of his daughter:&#xD;
"My pale-face friends are welcome at the wigwam of the Beaver. He be far&#xD;
from hisphome, aiid the pag'faces have not left him much; but what he has&#xD;
they are welcome to."&#xD;
Both scouts tookgha proffered hand, and David replied:&#xD;
"We thank yoti,  Beaver, for your welcome, I suppose you kind o' guess&#xD;
that we are sent by the General in tlhe sort, to find out whether you have any&#xD;
7inotions to come to an understandin' or not. So if-you will let us know whether&#xD;
you mean peace or war, we needn't bother you very long, but can return at*&#xD;
once from where we came and deliver your answer."&#xD;
The Beaver smiled.&#xD;
"You in big hurry.; but hurry no good, You rest first,.then eat, then sleep&#xD;
when the great light come again intogeaven, then plenty time to speak. Let&#xD;
my brothers step into the wigwam now."&#xD;
Tha guests were conducted into a room, which, though bare, of civilized fur-&#xD;
. niture, contained bundles of moss or hay which answered the purpose of chairs.&#xD;
When all had sat down, the Beaver filled his pipe, lit it, and after taking a few&#xD;
dr. ughts handed it to his guests, who imitated his example, and thereby secur-&#xD;
l ~his protection. -.After a grave silence of nearly an hour the Wild Rose en-&#xD;
;ered through a back-door, and carried on a stick the savory steaks, which were&#xD;
probably cut from the venison recently procured. Shehad visely changed her&#xD;
toilet; but the young hunter thought her as lovely-in 'ter plain working suit -as&#xD;
in the gaudy dress in which she had first p.-sented herself to his eyes. Indian,&#xD;

the center of the rooni, each one of the party secured a morsel and dispatched&#xD;
it without other irtipltements than hip ngrs,' teeth, and perhaps his hnting-&#xD;
knife.&#xD;
The meal being over, the conipany arose. "My'brothers must be tired" the&#xD;
Beaver suggested. " They may watif to lay down and sleep.&#xD;
"Not just at present, Beaver, thanks you" replie David.  It ,don't agree&#xD;
with me toi lie down i-ight after supper. So with your permission I shall walk&#xD;
about'a little and take a 16ok at your town,"&#xD;
"Goodo" said the Bearer with a -smile and the qmpany stepped again into&#xD;
the street, where the" dusk of dveiiig began to gather,.&#xD;
"Stay with the' chief" Davidwhispered -to his companion in an undertone,&#xD;
whefl he could do so without danger of being overhead  "I'llgo anti-recon-&#xD;
noiter the place. There is no tellin' how soon we may want a little information&#xD;
concarnin' it."&#xD;
Robert nodded, and turning to the chief drew into a conversation, while his&#xD;
comrade slowly and' vithrseeming carelessness loitered through the village.&#xD;
Here and there he passed groups of warriors, who answered his good evening&#xD;
with a grave rod-of the head, but made'no attempt'at f her intercourse. As&#xD;
the scout shad started on his walk for the purpose of se  g and not of talking,&#xD;
their reserve was very acceptable to him, and before the setting in of total dark-&#xD;
ness; he- had well nigh finished a circle around the village and fixed its most&#xD;
prominent features .ihis-memory. He had no special reason for appraliension&#xD;
on the contrary; the Delaware chief had smoked the calm  with them, a pro-&#xD;
ceeding entitling- them to his protection; but still the sc6u ad lived too long&#xD;
in the wilderness not to know the instaility of its affairs, and the wisdom of be-&#xD;
ing prepared for the worst 'while hopin -for the best.&#xD;
While he'slowly wandered through and around the village Robert remained&#xD;
with the chief, -apparently to be entertk'ned-by him, but in reality to engage his&#xD;
attention and withdraw his, eye froi the movethents of David. For'a'little&#xD;
while the two exchanged the unmeaning phrases, which good breeding seems&#xD;
to demand in savageas well' as civilized'society. After'talking forbalf an hour&#xD;
on the weather, or making compliments to one another, the chief informed the&#xD;
scout .of the-necessity of his departure, as he had-to see his'brother chiefs and&#xD;
prepare the tribe for to-morrow's meeting, in which the question of a treaty&#xD;
,With the Americans wouYd be discussed. This information was of course in-&#xD;
tended as an excuse for his departure, and the rough frontier man might indeed&#xD;
have learned many a lessop from his,-savage neighbor, as far as decorum and&#xD;
dignity of:rhanner'isconcerned. Self possession is the foundation of all civility,&#xD;
ad .this art the Indian was taught =frbm'his very infancy. The xthite back-&#xD;
woodsman on the contrary was very impulsive, and given to sudden outbreaks&#xD;
of-his passions, a fault hardly calculated to improve his rude manners.&#xD;
" Me back soon," the chief added; "but Wild Rose be at.home; my young&#xD;
brother talk to-her illonely."&#xD;

12THE WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVER.&#xD;
This hint Robert followed to a letter. The girl came from the house&#xD;
moments after her father hadceparted. She did not bring " her sewing'&#xD;
as a white girl would have done under similar circumstances; ,nor did sh&#xD;
that natural or artificial diffidence, which white girls frequently evinc&#xD;
alone with young men; but for all that nature had taught the young sav&#xD;
duties of her office to perfection. She knew that she was to entertains he&#xD;
to the best of her ability, and of this task she acquitted herself with adi&#xD;
tact. Beckoning him to~a rough bench before the house, and taking&#xD;
there herself, she began talking to the young man with a'elf-possessi&#xD;
intelligence which would have done credit to the levee of a princess.&#xD;
"You know my name; Wild Rose told you; will you not let her know&#xD;
"Certainly.I will, my god girl, and with pleasure, although in learni&#xD;
name you will but get acquainted with a very humble and obscure one.&#xD;
call me Robert Campbell."-&#xD;
" Robert Campbell," she repeated slowly and with emphasis. " Th.&#xD;
good name; me not forget it again."&#xD;
" I hope you will not, Rose; I hope'you vill recollect me as long as&#xD;
you, and I assure that won't be at a very early date."&#xD;
"No, me suppose not," she said with a touch of raillery.  'You r&#xD;
Wild Rose until Vo  eturn to the Fort and see white girl; white girl&#xD;
more beautiful than Indian!"&#xD;
There, behold a coquette of nature'sjpaking! Who will, after this, cc&#xD;
those who speculate with the talent which nature gave them?"&#xD;
" No, no, my good girl, there you'are  mistaken!" he exclaimed, with&#xD;
e-gy which must h1te been gratifying to her, savage that she was: She&#xD;
sweetly, but also archly. "Why you call me good?" she inquired,&#xD;
roguish turn of her head; how you knov'me'be good?"&#xD;
" Oh hhe who cannot see that must be blind indeed. Firstly, the Grea&#xD;
would not have ,suffered the most perfect work that ever left his han&#xD;
sullied by wickedness and depravity."&#xD;
She looked at him as if she only half understood his meaning.&#xD;
" Me fear your tongue be crooked," she said, with a tone intended to&#xD;
a reprimand. " Is that all why me call good?"-&#xD;
" No, Rose, I have another reason. I only need look into your ey&#xD;
then I know for sure, that you are good.'&#xD;
She sat pensively for a few moments; then she nodtled, and replied:-&#xD;
"Yes, me believe that,, for me see same thing in your eyes."-&#xD;
Tha last words were spoken with emphasis and liveliness. They emba&#xD;
th  young man, or rather they caused his finger ends to prickle, and hi&#xD;
to rush wildly to his heart, and then to diffuse over his whole face, with&#xD;
ing blush. Perhaps this was embarrassment for the young man could&#xD;
summon courage to gaze again into her face. Wlyn he finally venture&#xD;
this experiznent, hq found her eye, with a musing expression, fixed u&#xD;
countenance. : There was no coquetry about her now. ,She was eviden&#xD;

when    his. That was strange, but it was nothing stranger than the host of new emo-&#xD;

rpirable i other enabling her to do so with'impunity&#xD;
a seat     e had also seen many palefaces, who assured heri-of tfeir admiration; but in no&#xD;
on and   cas had their protestations impressed her like the simple but fervent statement of&#xD;
the young hunter, who was now a guest in her father's hose. :No-doubt his&#xD;
yours?"  handsome person and noble bearing had something to do with thisimpression;&#xD;
ng my    but his superior address and the plain marksof anedd ation above his compan-&#xD;
They    ions formed the -greatest attractions in her eyes.. Of this she was not clearly&#xD;
conscious, nor would she, on inquiry, have confessed to such a fact;- but-it was&#xD;
at very  nevertheless the case, while in a similar manner the suddenness of her-appear-&#xD;
ance, the fantastic style of her attire, the contrast of her wild surroundings, and&#xD;
I shall  her-romantic position as prinicess of this wandering tribe, deepened the impres-&#xD;
sioan which her beauty would otherwise' have made on him. In the morning&#xD;
collect  yet the victim of the aversion in which everything appertaining to.the Indian&#xD;
s much   was held by his companions, he now hardly asked himself any more, "Is she"&#xD;

This being the condition.of the enactors of the-dialogue, the reader may easily&#xD;
an en-   guess the nature of the remarks exclfanged. He will not miss the mark if he-4&#xD;

is to be  son. This was, according to Robert's statement -to the Wild Rose,.the full&#xD;
name of his companion. David was rather in a good humor. He had eaten&#xD;
well, digested well, reconnoitered to his satisfaction, and this, together with the&#xD;
convey   circumstances thatone-half;of the mission had been successfully executed, and&#xD;
that the other half bid fair to turn out like the first one, was certainly enough to&#xD;
es, and   create the good humor of anybody. When the Beaver returned,-a law minutes&#xD;
later, David- expressed himself as highly pleased with his host and the whole&#xD;
village.igfhsans1-oak&#xD;
" Now, if you can manage to-morrow," he said, rubbing his hands, "to make&#xD;
rrassed   your redskins dance the peacepipe, everythingwill be right. But it is late, chief,&#xD;

THE WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVER.&#xD;

1 17&#xD;
&#xD;
night, he now set aside all ceremonies and stepping into the apartment as hast-&#xD;
ily as the reigning darkness would permit, felt for his daughter's bed and call-&#xD;
ed her name. But both ear and touch failed to discover any signs of her&#xD;
presence and his original conjecture matured into certainty. Still he must ex-&#xD;
tendjiis researches to the .blockhouse containing the visitors, and turning in'&#xD;
that direction he has alreadystraversed onehalf the distance, when he hears a&#xD;
slight noise within the blockhouse and sees three dark figures.glide from it and&#xD;
disappear in the gloom of the night. Now he need doubt no longer. Heaving&#xD;
a sigiot relief, he turns tovards his lodge, glad and willing to take upon him-&#xD;
self the menial officers of a daughter,.who has so cleverly released him of an&#xD;
irksome obligation.&#xD;
Turning a corner of the blockhouse and striving to gain access to a back&#xD;
room, when he knew the remnants of to-night's meal to be stored away, he&#xD;
- suddenly came upon a dark figure, which like himself'started back with a low&#xD;
'exclamation of surprise. This surprise having rapidly abated the chief looked,&#xD;
keenly at the person thus. intruding upon the sanctity of his home and to his&#xD;
greatest consternation discovered his foe and rival-Maghpiway. Of all the&#xD;
persons on earth none could have been less acceptable to him at that moment.&#xD;
At other times and under different circumstances the Beaver would quickly&#xD;
Aave repelled such uncalled for inroads into the privacy of his premises; but as&#xD;
it was he trembled.at the thought of arousing his animosity. Wishing to retain&#xD;
the other sufficiently long to make a pursuit of the fugitives idle, he addressed&#xD;
him with as much urbanity as he could command.&#xD;
" Ahi !this is my brother, the chief !" he exclaimed with an astonishment,&#xD;
which h'2eed not feign. "What takes my brother so late into the night air "&#xD;
That is a question, which I might ask you with equal propriety."&#xD;
,,My answer might be that any movement of mine made on my own prem-&#xD;
ises surely did not concern outsiders. . But I want to oblige my brother and tell&#xD;
him, that I wanted to secure my back door against thedogs, fearing they might&#xD;
steal the meat standing there."&#xD;
"rAnd the runner in his house-is the Beaver stingy enough to deny him the&#xD;
food he badly needs ?"&#xD;
The Beaver started, a motion, which the darkness of night fortunately con-&#xD;
cealed from:his adversary. So Maghpiway was informed of the presence of the&#xD;
runner. Perhaps the latter haddropped a word or two to one of the sentinels,&#xD;
so that the chief might haveeven an idea of the runner's communication. With&#xD;
this supposition secrecy was not only of no use, but might even injure the fugi-&#xD;
tives, who had as yet but a trifling start. By seeming candor he might still&#xD;
put the announcement off till the following morning: so he said;&#xD;
"Ah!, is my brother aware of his-arrival?"r&#xD;
"Yes, why did the Beaver fail to tell me of it?"&#xD;
The English for Maghpiway.&#xD;
&#xD;
.The Beaver did not wish to rob his brother, the Red Feather,* the chance&#xD;
of a peaceful sleep."&#xD;
"So the news are bad?"&#xD;
"They will ptut the tribe in mourning, for several of our braves have departed&#xD;
for the spirit'land."&#xD;
"Ugh! were their scalps taken?"&#xD;
"I did not ascertain, because the rnner was very tired, Let him eat and&#xD;
sleep to-night, and question him to-morrow."&#xD;
"-Red Feather will ask only one more question; who slew our braves?"&#xD;
This question evinced as much sagacity, as cruelty. The chief knew the an-&#xD;
sver before hand, but it delighted him to see his formidable rival at .his mercy.&#xD;
Thee friend of thekhite man was compelled to record the white man's shame.&#xD;
For that satisfaction Maghpiway would have lost the braves a dozen times over.&#xD;
" Vinginians did it; the children of our father Penn woul 0 ave.refrained."&#xD;
" Ha! paleface is paleface and scalp ,is scalp! The blood of our braves cries&#xD;
for vengeance and the Red Feather will not'turn a deaf ear to its comes. lk&#xD;
will kill man for man and take scalp for scalp, until th e spirits of our bravesare&#xD;
,satisfied. To-morrow he will burn two palefaces aqd send their spirits torthe&#xD;
blessed hunting grounds of the Indian, to tel1 our braves of his purpose."&#xD;
The Beaver started again. Pretending not to understand the other, he in-&#xD;
quir'ed:&#xD;
What does the Red Feather mean'? the Beaver did not k low that he had&#xD;
two victims for the stake."                                    4&#xD;
S" The Beaver has, that is the same thing."&#xD;
" The Beaver has not. The two palefaces in his lodge are envoys. They&#xD;
have smokedthe calumet with me and their life is sacred."&#xD;
"And, I say', they must die; the reeking blood of our ves cries for ven-&#xD;
geance and when- the Red Feather tells the Delawares they will think as he&#xD;
does and support him."&#xD;
The Beaver was well aware, that this was  'ery probable, so he made a last&#xD;
eftort'to'gain time at least and said:f&#xD;
"Mnghpiway4fad better consider what he is about. The honor of the Del-&#xD;
awares has been kept bright through centurig-would the Red Feather ,sully&#xD;
it by treachery?"&#xD;
"The palefaces slew our braves in bad faith, they are dogs, they ought to be&#xD;
tramped to death without mercy."&#xD;
" Would the Red Feather be as mean? 'Let him listen to the Beaver; let&#xD;
him retire to his hut and sleep before he acts; the good spirit will send him bet-&#xD;
ter thoughts over night,'*&#xD;
The other mused a moment, tl en collecting himself like a man,, who has&#xD;
ro46med his resolution he said:&#xD;
"Very well, Maghpiway will do as the Beaver says; but before he retires to&#xD;
his couch, he must place guards around the lodge in wl ch the palefaces sleep,&#xD;
,so that they cannot steal away in the gloom of night."&#xD;

THE WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVER.&#xD;
After these words he walked towards the blockhouse where he imagined the&#xD;
Scouts still to he. The Beaver followed with a heavy heart-he saw the crisis&#xD;
fast approaching and that too at a time when the fugitives had hardly cleared&#xD;
the'slirts of the village. His courage sank within hin and delivering himself&#xD;
to silent despair, which paralyzed his energy and prevented all further, at-&#xD;
tempts at warding off the catastrophe, he renained a passive spectator of theI&#xD;
Red Feather's movements.&#xD;
That chief evidently walked towgrds the blockouse without any suspicion of&#xD;
the real condition of affairs, and-in softly opening the door and listening to  the&#xD;
breathing of the-supposed'sleepers, he merely acted on these principles of pre-&#xD;
caution which a long and early -practice had made his secon) natube. *If every-&#xD;
thing had been right, he would probably have proceeded t 'the lodges of some&#xD;
of his braves andisecured the persons of the scouts by placing half a dozen sen-&#xD;
tinels around the blockhouse. But unfortunately everything was not right. A&#xD;
violent start of the rhief proved sufficiently that this discovery came unexpect-&#xD;
edly to him. No breathing of any sleepers struck his ear and yet sleepers gen-&#xD;
eialy breathe rather noisily. Red Fyather began to suspect that he had been&#xD;
outwitted and when he hastily stepped into the apartment and found the couches&#xD;
empty his suspicion hecarne, conviction. For a moment he stood confounded&#xD;
and seemed incapable of forming any resolution. But when his reasoning pow-&#xD;
ers returned and told him that the flight of the scouts must be of a very recent&#xD;
date, he took his measures with a startling rapidity: He would no doubt have'&#xD;
liked to vent his fury by hurling his invectives against the Beaver, but knowing&#xD;
the value of every second, he abstained' from doing, so and rushing past the&#xD;
chief, rent the air with one fearful yell, which drove the slumber from every in-&#xD;
dividual in thkt village and caused the warriors  their weapons and rush&#xD;
to the place previously assigned to them as the re ezvous i'n emergencies.&#xD;
There they found Red Feather, who in spite of their rapid responses to his call,&#xD;
had meanwhile found sufficient faisure to acknowledge the truth of the proverb&#xD;
which says: the greatest haste does not always insure the greatest speed. His&#xD;
whoop had hardly left his lips, when he would gladly hagrecalled it. .if it&#xD;
served to quickly collect his wagiors, it was no- doubt also instrumental in warn-&#xD;
ing the fugitives of the discove v of theirfligh;- and in putting them on their&#xD;
guard against pursuit. k&#xD;
The error once committed, he co Idnow do nothing better than announce to&#xD;
his warriors the loss of their om ades, and the flight of the two scouts. By&#xD;
appealing to the passions of their savagenature, he might stir them up to un-&#xD;
usual efforts and thereby neutralize the injury likely t* accrue fromhis previous&#xD;
hastiness. "- '&#xD;
Nor wvas his calculation wrong. This'address to the tribe did not occupy&#xD;
more than five minutes, but at its conclusion the savages rushed into the woods&#xD;
with the fury of a pick of wolves, and a ealous haste forboding little good to&#xD;
the fugitives. Red Feather, of course, le the chase, while'the Beaver stayed&#xD;
behid; for though his nfluence over th t4ibe was insuieni'c',t to restrain it from&#xD;

&#xD;
the pursuit, he disdained to countenance an action which he considered calcu-&#xD;
lated to injure the reputation of the tribe.&#xD;
Before we nIw proceed to watch the movements of the pursuers, we have to&#xD;
turn back a moment and acquaint ourselves witahose of the fugitives. WVhen&#xD;
the Wild Rose had learned the nature 9f the'runner's message, she knew at&#xD;
once that it was no longer safe for the white visitors to remain iiithe village.&#xD;
ln/slipping secretly front the apartment shehad been actuated by different mo-&#xD;
tives. gn the qne hand her great apprehension for the safet.f her guests had&#xD;
made her unwilling- to wait for the termination of the interview; and on the&#xD;
other, hepsagacity had told her that her father's position would be less embar-&#xD;
rassed if sh could am and hurry off the strangers without his kr wlede. So&#xD;
she - had softly slip ed away, entered the other block house, aid by a slight&#xD;
shake recalled the hunters to consciousness. [he borderm'en of the last cen-&#xD;
tury were easily roused from their slunber. People who slep  with their guns&#xD;
in their arms, and hourly expect the attack of a savage foe, areapt to keep their&#xD;
ears open even in their sleep, and not to pass througlta state of semi-consci us&#xD;
drowsiness to that of complete wakefulness.: The first touch of the girl had&#xD;
caused the scouts-to 'rise to a- Bitting posture, and a " hist" of her lips cautioned&#xD;
them against making a noise.              '&#xD;
"Who are you and what do you want?" Anderson ,ow asked in an undertone.&#xD;
"It is me, the Wild Rose. You are in danger here; and must not stay another&#xD;
minute if you value your'lives."&#xD;
"But how is this? What has occurred?"&#xD;
"A runner came in justnow, announcing the B1eath of eleven braves by the&#xD;
hand of some wicked palefaces." 'yz&#xD;
" Ugh! that is ugly. I reckon, they'll make us foot the bill for that nastv&#xD;
job, if we remain'".-&#xD;
." Yes, even the Beaver could not save you."'&#xD;
" I gue s not.  W e  te  ready  for  a  start'Miss Rosy, 'so  if you'll show  the&#xD;
way we'll follow it+ your tracks."&#xD;
The maiden gYed from the room, and by her perfectknowvledge of the plact&#xD;
was enabled.to lead her proteges unobserved il the woods. Gliding rapidly,&#xD;
and with the noiselessness of a spetre through the wv-ods, shg proved a most&#xD;
efficient guide. Fifteen minutes after theii'departure from the village the trib&#xD;
had distanced it more than a mile, and the girl ,now came to a halt for 1ptlpur-&#xD;
l)ose of parting from her companions.&#xD;
Me must go back," she said, ' elge them suspect us. You know way as&#xD;
well as me, and to-morr  when then find you gone, you far away and .gie."&#xD;
These words were accompanied wish a noiseless laiIh, in which th ether&#xD;
joined. Then the hInters thanked the girl for her generous intercession.. Rel-&#xD;
ert grasped and firmly pressed her hand.&#xD;
"I thank you Wild Rose," he said, "I truly'and hearly thank you for your&#xD;
kindness. I am your debtor and shall not rest until I have'acquitted m self (c&#xD;

20               THE WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVER.&#xD;
did not entertain the hope of seeing you again., Will you keep a little place in&#xD;
your heart and memory for Robert Campbell?"&#xD;
Me shall think of you; indie, the Wild Rose could not forget, if she would."&#xD;
The youth was on the point of replying when a distant yell startled them&#xD;
from their fancied security.&#xD;
"There listen!" "Anderson exclaimed, " they must have discovered our flight."&#xD;
"No doubt o it," Robert responded. " They'll start on our trail lke a set&#xD;
of bloodhounds-&#xD;
The maiden had remained still thus long. She stood as if the yelhad trans-&#xD;
formod her *b a statue; but after a^ few seconds she had regained he command&#xD;
of hef timbs nd tongue and urged her companions to a $edy flight.&#xD;
"Run!" she said in her n tive tongue, which she seemed to prefer in mo-&#xD;
ments of eeite pent, "Run; or they'll overtake you, and I will be.forced to&#xD;
see you perish'-the stake. Listen! the sounds are coming nearer. Oh, Rob-&#xD;
e t; do not tarry!"&#xD;
Thus urged by their'-guide, as well as by that instinct of preservation, which&#xD;
is innate to every human heart, the two hunters hastily withdrew from the spot&#xD;
and hurried through the  oods as rapidly as the reigning darkness and neces-&#xD;
sary precaution -ould permit. They had to avoid every noise, for alter that&#xD;
shout of exultant expectation with which their foes had started on their chase,&#xD;
the deepest silence prevailed over the woods. A careless step, the snapping ofl&#xD;
a twig, or4he rustling f the foliage through which they passed, could bring&#xD;
their pursuers down upon them: and much as tly longed to withdraw from&#xD;
that perilous neighborhood, 4hey were too well schooled in the practice of the&#xD;
forest, to neglect the needful easures of precaution. An inexperienced ob-&#xD;
server of their flight mitt indeed have easily imagined that'they were in no&#xD;
great haste at all. All their steps were calculated, all their movements mea-&#xD;
sured, and every now and thenthey would even coma to a dead sti and listen,&#xD;
with an acuteness which only a life like theirs can giveto the ear. Speak they&#xD;
did but little, for so prfectly didithese men understand  ch other and their&#xD;
craft that these worts wereuperfluous, especially when as in the present in-&#xD;
stance they might prove treacerous. Ngw and then, however, they bent their&#xD;
.heads together, and conversed inthe lowest whisper. _ This was the case, when&#xD;
all -once a small watercourse intercepted their steps.&#xD;
rhati Aowv?" said Anderson turning to his companion. " I am for coming"&#xD;
tota clear understandin' of what we ark about. 'Tis no use to run about like&#xD;
trightened chickens; but we must layour plans andct on then. So let's have&#xD;
yo r opinion, Robert."&#xD;
"'You are the older and more experienced, David, and a.  such ought to peal&#xD;
first."&#xD;
"Nonsense, don let us waste our time by turnin"compliments. You hav,&#xD;
surely served your 'prenticeship, and are entitled to a heatin' So speak-out."&#xD;
" Well, as you -like, David. My opinion is this: The Indians won'ttry s&#xD;
much to catch us right away, whc o.n account of the darknes -and s  e little&#xD;

THE WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVER.                   A&#xD;
manouvering on our part, woulti be a pretty hard thing for them to do; but they&#xD;
are more likely to make all haste to outdistance us and draw a line of pickets&#xD;
between us and the Fort in order to capture ,in -1 gssing it. This they can&#xD;
easily -do, as there is not much need of secreaoid caution on their part."&#xD;
"Aye; aye, there is reason in what yotfsgy. Go on."r&#xD;
"Well, this line of'theirs, it strikes me, will follow the creek the call Conne-&#xD;
quenessing, on the east of Beaver river, and from its mout across the woods&#xD;
to the Little Beaver on the west of it. There is.no other li  here a. fugitive&#xD;
could be so easily intercepted."&#xD;
"Well, grantin' as much; what are you drivin' at?"&#xD;
" I was just going to explain. It will hardly'do for us to strikes  in a raight&#xD;
line for the Fort-"&#xD;
"No, I guess not," David dryly interrupted., " They'd soon collar us, if '&#xD;
were fools enough to try that game.&#xD;
" Well, nothing remains for us then but to turn their flank.',&#xD;
"Exactly."&#xD;
"But there are two flanks to choose from."&#xD;
" True as the Gospel."&#xD;
Robert indulged in a noiseless laugh, for the cooniess of his comrade in their&#xD;
trying plight a used him.&#xD;
"You mear thatistatement-requires but little penetration; still the choice is a&#xD;
little 4iore difcult."&#xD;
" Which side would-yo advise?"&#xD;
" I hardly. now. The country west of theBeaver is les's cut up bypraines&#xD;
and watercou'ses, but as the Indians know this well as w, they - re.:tileC&#xD;
likely to expect us there and consequently teep a keen.lookout. Tl e, astrn&#xD;
ilank offers more natural impediments, but what iniedg us, hinders the enemy&#xD;
and mayn case of emergency be turned into a means of defense. After mature&#xD;
reflection I am.therefore inclined to prefer the left flank."&#xD;
" Reasoned life a larned judge; but .hout jokin' Rdbert, youhave express-k&#xD;
ed my own view of the matter and if you agree we ny as wellbegin to carry&#xD;
out your plan. But wait, stop one more momit. It's verfdoubtful whether&#xD;
we'll have another such chance for'consultation ashe Doctors have it-and we&#xD;
had better come to a full understandin' conc'erniii' our movements betort ve&#xD;
start. Supposin' we step first into the run and follow it to where it stu1es the&#xD;
Beaver?"&#xD;
" That would answer very well, for besides taking us in-the right direction,&#xD;
it woulkbe calculated to confound the savages if they should follow ouktraii.&#xD;
,," Welt, 4then, s6'much, so good. After reaching the i:ivei-, I am for crossin' it&#xD;
at once, ford orno'ford, Our course on the other side will of course depend on&#xD;
the nature of the ground. We shall likely find some run coming' from the east&#xD;
which we may fogow to its ource: When far enough east we can change our&#xD;
course, steeria' south, untilwe strike the Ohio-wasn't that your idea?"&#xD;
' It was,Datvid."&#xD;

" Very well, then we understand each other to perfection. But one thing&#xD;
more, we may get separated in our flight-what then?"&#xD;
You know the big kno ta.&amp;amp;three miles from the Ohio?"&#xD;
"Yes, very well."      y&#xD;
" Wqul hat not be a good point gf rendezvous?"&#xD;
" It wo    In case of separation we strike for it then and wait there for ofne&#xD;
another-how long?"&#xD;
" Until sundo'ri to-morrow."&#xD;
"Hardly that long. The distance is but short, and he that fails to reach it&#xD;
by to-morrow noon, must be either dead pr captured., In such a case wve can-&#xD;
not reach the ort too soon, to fetch a party of relief."&#xD;
" You are. khtilet it be noon then."&#xD;
"Very well, havin' come to a fair understanding' we may proceed. Will you&#xD;
take the lead?"&#xD;
"No David, Id rather trust to your greater skill and experience."&#xD;
"XWell, as you please. The post in the rear is, infact as responsible as that&#xD;
in front; for there is no knowin',which way the Injuns may beset us. Are you&#xD;
ready? Off is the word then."&#xD;
With these words Davfd cautiously descended to the bottom of the run,&#xD;
which, like most watercourses of that country, flowed in the bottom of a steep&#xD;
ravine. Robert followed at his heels and soon they were vigorously making&#xD;
their way t yards s the Beaver, a course w ich did not remove them any farther&#xD;
fron , the Indian village, but formed-as we knoxy a feature in the pln they&#xD;
h~aid-&#xD;
uaeii stopping place nghthave been about five miles from the Delaware&#xD;
town ad three miles from the rier, proving that in their flight they had taken&#xD;
a southwestern directon. ; The bed of the run containing but little water and&#xD;
few impediments, they reached the Beaver river in less than an hour. Here.&#xD;
however, their progress necessarily became somewhat slower. No knowing&#xD;
whether the river was fordable ate t place, they had to construct a light raft&#xD;
of dry wood on which they deposi td their rifles, powder horns and all such&#xD;
other implements, as would dat bear the contact with water. . Keeping this frail&#xD;
craft between them, they entered the channel, which they found less deep than&#xD;
they had anticipated. The water at the deepest place hardly reached their hips;&#xD;
but at they resolved to follow the course of the river, until the mou h of some&#xD;
runycoming from the east, they allowed the raft with their rifles to float on."&#xD;
merely guiding and controlling it by a projecting twig.&#xD;
The eastern bank was steep and high and overhung by dense bushes, whose&#xD;
. shade still increased the darkness of the night and thereby ihprgved the chances&#xD;
of the travelers to reihain unobserved. At times, however, the channel of the&#xD;
river lying on that side and the water in such cases being deep and swift, they&#xD;
had every now and, then to cross and recross, until at length the desired run on&#xD;
the eastern side made its appearance. They had lost so much time in desultory&#xD;
movements, that they could form no estimate of the distance.they had marched&#xD;

THE wILD ROSE      1HE BEAVER.                23&#xD;
in the bd of the river. They judged it, however, to be about two miles and as&#xD;
they had left the village at a late hour, travelled some ten miles and stopped at&#xD;
intervals, they concluded that the time must .  nsiderably past midnight. In&#xD;
such a case there would be but a few more he  Hf etarkness, and as they had&#xD;
still a long walk before them rapidity of motion became as impor  a consid-&#xD;
ation as stealth and secrecy. Accordingly they proceeded up the  at a gait&#xD;
which now and then occasioned 'a slight stumbling, accompanied with more or&#xD;
less noise. At such times they would stop a moment and listen, but everything&#xD;
remaining quiet, start anew and bending all their strength and energy upon the&#xD;
task before them, climb higher and higher in the stony bed of the run, which&#xD;
flowed through aldeep and winding gorge.&#xD;
At length streaks of gray began to shoot across the sky ineating the ap-&#xD;
proach of rday. The travelers had added ten more miles to the distance trav-&#xD;
ersed and began to study the propriety of turning to the right and striking for&#xD;
the 'stream, which even then went under the name of "Slippery rock Creek."&#xD;
If the Indians had really done, gs Robert imagined, and drawn a line of pickets&#xD;
across the country it was hardly probable that this line extended far enough to&#xD;
intercept them here. They considered the  greatest danger past and resolved to&#xD;
rest a few minutes before they.would undertake to climb the height on their&#xD;
right and from there start on' the new course. Selecting a mossy ledge, they&#xD;
sat down and despatched the remnants of their provisions consisting of corn&#xD;
bread and pork. The hospitality of the Wild Rose had enabled them, to save&#xD;
this food and it came now verb handy, as this forced walk had given theme, an&#xD;
appetite and the neighborhood of their foes forbade the use of the rifle~o  5&#xD;
purpose of killing game. Their flasks moreover cntained some of.th  -&#xD;
whiskey, -which the 'western counties of Pennsylvana were famous for pr( ?ic-&#xD;
ing and thus the scouts were enabled o make a meal, calculated to reri v their&#xD;
waning strength. A quarter of an hour however was all the leisure they would&#xD;
permit themselves and at the expiration of that time they roseand began to as-&#xD;
cend the steep hill constituting the sott,  side of the gorge. The darkness&#xD;
had by this time fieldedto a grayish t' get, which much facilitated their as-&#xD;
cent; 'aid increased in strength, as they approached the top. The trees there&#xD;
stood comparatively thin, so that our adventurers obtained a tolerable vie* into&#xD;
distance.. The country was undulating or ro ng-with here and there a&#xD;
higher knob projecting from the wavy surface. But high or low, far or near,&#xD;
there wasn't a foot of- ground to be seen, that was not densely covered'with&#xD;
foliage.&#xD;
As thetwo stood gazing'upon this scenery which at other times might have&#xD;
excited their admiration, the sun sent, the first- enlivening ray upon the lealy&#xD;
ocean. In his light they perceived.a foggy streakat the distance of about four&#xD;
miles, which probably hovered" over some larger streamof water.&#xD;
"That must be the creek we're aimin' at said Anderson." It isn't over .far&#xD;
away either and an hour's tramp can take us there. I feel like a different mat&#xD;
since takin' a bite and if you agree, we may as well start without delay."&#xD;

,Robert consented and once more the companions resumed their march. The&#xD;
ground favored a rapid, and yet noiseless gait and the progress of the two would&#xD;
have been entirely satisfactory, if the total absence of undergrowth had not&#xD;
somewhat alarmed then  -  en bthctrees were so thinly scattered over the&#xD;
ground that they were' able K see a considerable distance. This of course,&#xD;
would  hasuited them well enough; but this open view exposed them in an&#xD;
equal measure to other parties, a circumstance much less acceptable. How-&#xD;
ever they had no choice and so they proceeded in that state of nervousness,&#xD;
which-the fear of danger is more apt to engender, than the presence of it.&#xD;
For half an hour everything went well and they were just beginning to ac-&#xD;
custom themselves to their exposed condition, when all at once an outbreak of&#xD;
fiendish yells 4n their rear startled them and for a moment threatened to paralyze'&#xD;
their nerves. This condition, however lasted but a moment and iyhen theyJ&#xD;
turned to learn the number and position of their pursuers, they did not only'in-&#xD;
tend to make a final effort to escape, but also urited with this intention the firm&#xD;
hope of being able to do it.&#xD;
Still their position was truly desperate. Some twenty Indians came rushing&#xD;
down the slope, which they themselves had just finished descending. At the&#xD;
moment of yelling they might have been 5oo yards from the two scouts; but as&#xD;
they ran at the top of their speed this distance was of course rapidly diminish-&#xD;
ing. The fugitives saw therefore that no time was to be lost. Turning and&#xD;
dropping the hand which held the rifle to their side, they cclergted their motion&#xD;
to a rapid run. A casual spectator of the exciting race which was thus inaug-,&#xD;
uatdl, would have noticed that the Indians continued to gain on the whites;.&#xD;
but hecould also have hardly failed to observe, that the latter were not yet ex-&#xD;
erting themselves to theitutmost ability and that they were moreover laboring&#xD;
under disadvantage arising out of the nature of the ground. While the In-&#xD;
dians were running down hill, they were aspending the upward grade of the&#xD;
next swell, which, though rather gentle, called forth greater efforts and -t the&#xD;
same time allowed less progress. This circumstance however gave our friends&#xD;
no trouble They knew that theundians would have to surmount the same&#xD;
difficulty, while they themselves would soon enjoy the advantage of the coming&#xD;
slope. *chey also understood the folly of wasting one's strength at the begin,&#xD;
ning of the chase, especially if it promised to be a long one. The swiftest run-&#xD;
ner is apt to be beaten, if he does not add-endurance to swiftness. This thing&#xD;
was not new to them; for if they had never before been in the same strait, they&#xD;
surely had labored under similar difficulties. Running formed a prominent&#xD;
-        feature in the education of the backwoodsman. It entered into the pliays of, the&#xD;
boy from infancy and as many a life had been saved by being skilled in it, but&#xD;
few would neglect to possess themselves of so desirable an accomplishment.&#xD;
"While our adventurers were thus running before a deadly foe, they ex-&#xD;
changed only the very fety words absolutely necessary.&#xD;
We must part" said Anderson, "vyotl are quick of foot and can outrun, 'em&#xD;
I for my part shall dodge them.'&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WILD RO3E OF  THE BiEPVER&#xD;
"Why David, I won't think of leavinv u.&#xD;
Moonshine 7I'll take care of mysel,.As soon a you rea  the Fort, take&#xD;
outa party, to-scour the woods. I shah turn' p somewhere or other, depend&#xD;
upon it.&#xD;
"But David."&#xD;
{ Don't waseyour breath. Mine is getting short already. Mind I shall&#xD;
take to cover, the first chance I get; so don't spile  eame by any silly trick&#xD;
of yours."&#xD;
Robert seemed inclined to make another effort at persi.jon, but as his com-&#xD;
- panion turned a deaf ear to him, and nothing is more apt to-exhaust a runner&#xD;
than speaking, the young man kepthis peace and began to arrange his&#xD;
movements in accordance with Anderson's wishes. They hasd by this time not&#xD;
only passed, the summit of the swell, but nearly reached the botto: on the&#xD;
dthpe"side.-The next-grade was somewhat steeper and this steepness'ncreased&#xD;
ap they, approached the-creek. The woods moreover in a certain measure lost&#xD;
their open character, the trees standing fuore closely and undergrowth here and&#xD;
there making its appearance. While this checked both the swiftness of pur-&#xD;
surcrs.and letthe chances of; Rbert and the Indians ufghanged, it greatly fa-&#xD;
vored the design of Anderson, W  ,n they reached the t  of the next eleva-&#xD;
tion, which was so densely woode  s to compel the fugitives to force a pas-&#xD;
sage by pushing aside the bushes; he looked around for a place where he might&#xD;
hide himself, to let the Indians pass. Seeing the gigantic, truik of a tree lying&#xD;
at right angles with their course he called a last adieu to his companionand&#xD;
after-jumping over the log,. hastened to ednceal himself underneath.' Circum-&#xD;
stances evidently favored him beyond expectation,  r the log being hollowed&#xD;
out inthemiddle with the upper and lower ends less impaired, the sedbt found&#xD;
an excellent, hidig place, of which he availed himself without delay. gCreeping&#xD;
towards, the lower end of the log.,-until he reached the part, where only the&#xD;
ieart had decayed .ad fallen out, he awvted the coming of the Indians. On&#xD;
they came, even soqer than he expected thcm, long before the wild beating of&#xD;
his heart had in a kneasure subsided. So loud did it knock against hi ribs,&#xD;
that he for a moment fancied it might betray him to his foes. But on-tierWent,&#xD;
'more than half a dozen simping on and very the very lqg, that hid him, rush-&#xD;
ing wildly intQ the thicket ahead and never stopping to examine the truink.&#xD;
Partly this was owing to the eagerness of the pursuit and the woody character&#xD;
of the place; but partly, mainly it w  clue to the noble conduct of Robert&#xD;
Campbell; When the young man imagined the Indians to be near the neighbor-&#xD;
hood'of his, friend, he with utter disregard for his own safety madh the woods&#xD;
ring with one loud shout of defiance. This of course drew the attention of the&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
reputation of being ste swiftest runner and as the chase flew der thie:hill and&#xD;
valley, the hope of thwarting the expectations of his wild foes, became stronger&#xD;
m d stronger  alas! he was not t    t man whom a cruel fate struckdown&#xD;
at the very moment wheh affairs ap#d to assume a propsitidus shape.&#xD;
The ground over which the ace-w s run, had, as we already know, gradu-&#xD;
ally assumed a more hilly character. Not that the hills had become an'y higher,&#xD;
but they had, as it were, been shoved into a compacter form,;causing apid&#xD;
passage across their brow to be.accompanied with greater exertion arid-con-&#xD;
sequently-greater fatigue. 'Under these circumstances two miles had' been&#xD;
traversed and Robert began to wonder why the creek in front did n-ot' fail to&#xD;
come in view, when'all at once its bed yawned befoi-e liim with suchsdden-&#xD;
ness, that the impetus of his rapid motion would sur eIy have plunged him' into'&#xD;
the flood, if he had not fortunately checked it in the nick of time, by s izing a&#xD;
sapling, grQwing, on the bank. The tree almost bent to the'grounds and would&#xD;
have bke, if it had not been a tough hickory. Thanks to this circunistance&#xD;
Robert was able to raise again and look for a place, where a tnofe slopingbt4 k&#xD;
would permit passage.  For this purpose he cast a rapid glance up and down&#xD;
the creek; but the sight that met his eye, was well calculated to shake even as&#xD;
stout a -heart as his As far as he could see, the creek had contracted its' bed&#xD;
into a deep and narrw gorge,'through which the waters rushed: with a fury&#xD;
threatening instant destruction, to any o  bold enough, to venture a leap into&#xD;
their mad current.&#xD;
To risk a spring across was hardly less perilous, for the chasm at the nar-&#xD;
rowest place measured at least 'twenty feet: Yet the fugitive had only this&#xD;
alternative, for to stay behind and surrender himself into the hands of'his re-&#xD;
lentless foes-was out of the question.  Nor had he much time, to prepare for&#xD;
the fearful leap, for a site minute would bring his pursuers tg his heels. Rob-&#xD;
ert' had therefore hardly taken in the-nature of the ground, when he set upon&#xD;
the execution of this desperate measure. . -Selecting 'a place free-of underbrush&#xD;
andstepping -back sufficiently far, to gain the necessary start, he ran towards&#xD;
the chasm w ith the swiftness of an arrow and with a powerful effort succeeded&#xD;
in sending his body safely ,on the other side.&#xD;
Tlc. momentum of the leap caused -him to drop on hisikhees and hands, but&#xD;
- *     in a mOthent he stood erect again and turned towards the creek, was on the&#xD;
point of sending anther shout of triumphant exultlion into the air, when a&#xD;
hand was laid on his shoulder and a voice whispered into his ear:&#xD;
"Pale-face good jump! much good ump indeed!".&#xD;
A though completely taken9y surprise thescout turned to the person, who&#xD;
had so boldly ventured within reich of his arm, fully determined to made him&#xD;
feel its strength, when-behold! his eyes fell upon fully a dozen of Indian war-&#xD;
riors, who had formed a sehi-circle around hin, cutting off his retreat in every&#xD;
direction, except that ofthe creek, to leap, into which would have been worse&#xD;
than madness.   To spri   back upon the other dank was almost out of the&#xD;
Question; for even if the Indians arotd him would have suffered such a step,&#xD;

CHAPTER =I:&#xD;
LOVEASA DELIVERER&#xD;
saWheft'thc  reached there the sun was near his meridian. In passing the&#xD;
dge' ot the Beaver, Hobirt saw the chief Stan ling in the door, a picture of&#xD;
sullen dejection: In the rear he percived theWWild Rose;, vo looked at him&#xD;
with a lance of deep compassion. These signs were rtper discouraging, for&#xD;
Robert rightly constructed the dejection of the only friendly disposed persons in&#xD;
the camp as indicative of certain a  erhapshorrible destruction. Theistakes&#xD;
and 'iks tortures rose vividly before his "mind and for a moment he regretted,&#xD;
that he had not thrown himself into the waters of the Slippery Rock Creek, thus&#xD;
securingat least a rapid death. ;But youth is like cirkwood in- water-it will&#xD;
not bedepressed any length of tirmeanei only surrenders hope  vith life. If&#xD;
Robert had no great expectatioifof escaping from th hands of his foes, he was&#xD;
at least confident of finding an opportunity, to make te attempt and in tht-&#xD;
tetpt meet with a more speedy and l ss pAinful death thadwaited himn at the&#xD;
stake.! ,-the bordermen of that period v*ere perhaps as fond of life as we are&#xD;
but the-constant-expectation of death inits most horrid aipe constantly nerved&#xD;
them in- eimergencies to an: extent, which seems truly wonderful to us. {Al:=&#xD;
though they did not carry stoicism as far-as' their savage neighbors who would&#xD;
endure the- tortures without uttering a sound of pain, they were aleAt and in&#xD;
many lustances did for hours bear torments, the mere thought ofwhich causes&#xD;
a- shudderto creep'over our body; So, ifthe young hunter did not go to ||t&#xD;
his faie with the boastful challenge of the Indian warrior , he' Was equally far&#xD;
from fear and dejeion. His face wag pale,)ut as he retui-ned the exulting&#xD;
glances of the tribe, that had gathered on the way to the council ground, they&#xD;
became fully convinced'that lie wduld not increase their sport by vain expostu-&#xD;
lations and appeals to their mercy.&#xD;
The place, where the Indians met in council, was in the center of the village.&#xD;
The blockhogse us-ed formerly by the christian Ir' ns for religious meetings&#xD;
was standing on one side of a kind of public squar . It was in as dilapidated a&#xD;
Condition as the dwelling houses, but still would answer well enough for hold -&#xD;
ing council. Into it therefore the prisoner was led and placed in the center,&#xD;

28               THE WILD ROSE OF THE       ER.&#xD;
while the warriors-ehtitled to a vote in-council rapge4 uhe lsjves on  number&#xD;
of logs lining the wi hi en all were there, the Beaver aroe and informed&#xD;
the tribe of 4heirr aI of the ru er and t character of his yvs. He called&#xD;
upon the man to tell his Story ai  inner acquitted himself of his task vith&#xD;
the eloquence peculiar to the i;ed nen.iHe described the crossing of the river,&#xD;
the peaceful nature of their errnl and the cruel and wanton attack madfiupon&#xD;
their party.  This part of the tory was delivered rapidly and irr a loud tone;&#xD;
but when he related the death of his companions and enlarged upon their mer-&#xD;
its and respective virtues, 'his voice be o ne deep, low and mellow. When he&#xD;
stopped and resumed his seat, a dee  si el ce pervaded the assembly; but the&#xD;
furious glances, which the warriors cast  on the prisoner, told hini clearly,&#xD;
that the silence was more ominous, than any exclamations-of wrath, in which&#xD;
they could have indulged.,    .&#xD;
After the runner had retired, Red Feather rose and addressed the as 'embly.&#xD;
After recaptulating tlat part of the previous speech relating to the virtuesof&#xD;
murdered w arriors, ', bent his whole skill and energy upon rousing the&#xD;
sions of his hearers. He told them, that the reeking blood called for vengen&#xD;
that the spirits of the slain wvOhld wander restlessuntil the blood of the white&#xD;
man would fow in, retaliation. . He then referred to the prisoner and told therni,&#xD;
that it was not onlygtheir privilege, but their bounden duty to sacrifice him to.&#xD;
the names of their murdered brethren.;&#xD;
When he retired, a dull murmur ran t tough the assembly, which might have&#xD;
swelled to more glaring mnifestations of exciteme t and fury, if the Beaver had&#xD;
not risen to address them.' -'No sooner became his intention manifest, when&#xD;
every sound abated and the assembly, prepared to listen wit every indication&#xD;
of respect to a rief; who, thought far from. absolute, had ah ays .stood high&#xD;
inh estimation of the te&#xD;
He begar' by lamenting the fate of the murdered party. H  admitted, that&#xD;
the tribe, had just cause for indignation and that this wanton act must be re-&#xD;
venged, but hecouelled the assembly, to temper their wrath with prudence.&#xD;
He warned them not to punish the innocent for the guilty, but rather to delay&#xD;
their vengeance, until they could turn it in the proper direction. He ieminderd&#xD;
then,,that Virginians and not Pennsylvanians were guilty of this bloodshed.&#xD;
He afinded them of the good relation, which had always prevailed between&#xD;
the tribe and the children of the good father Perin antI finally implored them;&#xD;
not to suffer their better judgment to be blinded by wrath and prejudice, nor&#xD;
their honor to be sullied by: rourderirg a man, who hadgnked the calumet}&#xD;
h lodge of their chief.&#xD;
When this impressive harangue was ended, the assembly preserved-the pre-&#xD;
iuus silence. The Beaver had appealed to the better nature, their reaso andC&#xD;
that was ai undertaking by far more diffieult, that that of Red Feather. , or&#xD;
i this so with savages al e-all the world over people are more easily swayed&#xD;
by passion,, than by reason; hence the struggle of the true statesman with the&#xD;
&#xD;
THE' WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVER.                 29&#xD;
demagogue, in whichIhe better but t9o frequently obtains temporary advanta-.&#xD;
1aihp way ie a second time,,    his spec h contained thing new; it was&#xD;
sigly a -repetition of his former i nective  'a nmord strenuous key  Beavar&#xD;
'saw this; he  saw the resolution of the assembly fixed on their faces and un-&#xD;
willir{to waste his words on deaf ears, proceed  to take the vote. In answer&#xD;
to the inquiry; shalt this prisoner die? a majority of the tribe struck the ground&#xD;
with their-tomahawks, answering the question aflirnatively. The Beaver how-&#xD;
ever saw,=that this majority was n  overwhelming; that. consisted of the&#xD;
younger and more passionate ut e influential members of the tribe and on&#xD;
This he based his'hope of finally  iing the prisoner in spite of the resolution.&#xD;
So the Heaver once more addressed.the men, asking them, whether they. had&#xD;
not bet r postpone the execution of the sentence, stil after their return to their&#xD;
more    stern home? To stay here-much longer, ie said was out of the hues-&#xD;
ton, for the companion of the prisoner, who had escaped 'them, would by this&#xD;
be at the Fort, urging the sending of troops agai  he village. He, the&#xD;
ver, had hoped, that the journey of the tribe to this ace would result iri the&#xD;
tablishment of peace with the people of Pennsylvania, but their decision hav-&#xD;
ing fallen the -other way, he was prepared. to respect it.  Only this he would&#xD;
submit to their consideration: would tlr speedy execution of the prisoner not&#xD;
delay their departure and thereby 'endader the safety of the tribe.&#xD;
TIhe chief saw to his secret satisfaction that his words had-inade the desired&#xD;
effect on the older warriors; he might perhaps ha*carried his point without&#xD;
opposition, if -tRed Feather had not sprung up, an  in a furious strain accused&#xD;
him of the design, to depxive the young men of heamusement'in store for them.&#xD;
He demonstrated, that the execution would only delay them a few holrs, and&#xD;
. thai, moreover, in case of an attack, the tribe was strong eough tosrepel any&#xD;
number of pale-faces, that might be sent against it. He was in favonof4  ry-&#xD;
ing out the sentence without delay, and would ask the ted ion of the tribe on&#xD;
the question. Again a majority of hatchets struck the ground, and although&#xD;
the Beaver perceived it to-be lesser than tife one with h'ich the first motion&#xD;
had been carried,/he was deprived of any pretense for further delay. He thei-e-&#xD;
fore ordered the' prisoner to be removed from the building, and to be led to the&#xD;
center of the commons, where a beech tree of about a foot's thickness afforded&#xD;
a good opportunity to carry out the fiendish design of the tribe.  ;&#xD;
Robert Campbell had in the mean time been the prey of varying emotions.&#xD;
His knowledge    e4Delaware language had enabled him to follow the&#xD;
speeches which      een delivered 'in- iis case, and in proportion as they were&#xD;
friendly or hosti hu hope would rise oT sink. Nothing is more calculated, as&#xD;
'we have said before, tounnerve the heart than doubt and expectation? If Rob&#xD;
bert had- at once been led to execution, he would have borne his lot without a&#xD;
inrmur, but this bebate upon his destiny had strangely increased his love of&#xD;
life.and hope of ultimate: escape. When, therefore, after all, his doom was&#xD;
1 sealed and he was taken to the tree, that was to:Ipport his body writhing in&#xD;

just n the point of 'bounding awayhn suddenly a sight met his eye, that&#xD;
made him stop in extreme surprisecausing his body to remain immovable,:as&#xD;
if it had been cut out of stohe. Breaking through the foremost circle of specta-&#xD;
tors, a young maiden started into the open space, which had beeji left fogthe&#xD;
actors, selected to play a role in'the approaching tragedy. Her face, of course&#xD;
was turnd towards the prisoner, and it was the recognition of the lovely fea-&#xD;
y't         tureof he Wild Rose, that exercised so powerful asspell upon the young hu'&#xD;

ter as her husband and asks her father, the chief, to release him from his bon-&#xD;

It would hae been a subject worthy the painter's brus , to depict the effect&#xD;
this speed on the different'parties around hgr. The e  tive at first listened&#xD;
with curiosity; but'as her intention gradually developed itself to his understand-&#xD;
ing, supiise, joy,'gratitude and love for this'lovely and noble creature struggled&#xD;

But while the young hunter was thtis revelligifn the extacies of first love,&#xD;
the chief Maghpiway entertained sensations of a very different nature. Fury,&#xD;
envy, and jealously were some of the ingredi'ants boiling in his bosomy&#xD;
Gladly would he have'foiled the'girl in her attempt, to rescue the prisoner, if&#xD;
he had only seen a way t&amp;amp; do it. : He knew.well, enough, that the..customs of&#xD;

The chief said these last words more to himself, than to his young guest,&#xD;
who observed a respectful silence. .After a'few minutes the Beaver resumed:&#xD;
"The Wild Rose has been the solace of my age. If you take her away, I&#xD;
sliall miss her very much. It is hard to think I shall no longer hear the sweet-&#xD;
ness of her voice, the silvery music of her laughter. StillI suppose it is all for&#xD;
the- best; indeed I see it in the hand of the Great Spirit. The Wild Rose was&#xD;
not made for the wigwam of the red nian; she would wither away like her&#xD;
namesake, if plucked by his rough hand. But will she be better off among the&#xD;
pale-faces? Will the Yankee women not look down on her, the daughter of a&#xD;
chief? Will not my young friend finally tire of the Indian girl and repent of hav-&#xD;
ing taken her-to his bosom? If 'I thought so I would .s  'bury this scalping -&#xD;
knife in her bosom, than let her depart from my lodge-'&#xD;
."Surely, the Beaver does not think so meanly of ime!"t e scout responded.&#xD;
"Has not the Wild Rose saved my life? Has she not bestowed upon me the&#xD;
most precious prize of her affection? No inde d: the sun will sooner siverve&#xD;
from his path, than I from my fidelity to your daughter." =&#xD;
' So may the Great -Spirit bless you as you are faithful to this vow!" thet old&#xD;
chief 'said with -a voice so grave: and solemn, that his young hearers were&#xD;
deeply impressed. "But where do you intend taking the Wild Rose? They,&#xD;
would scorn and scoff her in the Fort."&#xD;

persuade thar comand, and knowing that nothing is m111 i 4 hulat  r  =&#xD;
gender bad thoughts, than idleness; he directed the tribe tor  ith ut delar&#xD;
the necessary preparations for an early departure., To this th  TId notgbject&#xD;
for they knew well enough, that it was impossible, to remain so near the, Fort&#xD;
after this act. of violence committed against one Hof the envoys of the com-&#xD;
mander. So they set to work with a good will and in the general uproar soon&#xD;
seemed to forget the prisoner and his strange deliverance.&#xD;
Robert of course accompanied the-Beaver and his betrothed into their lodge  ..&#xD;
where he received back his rifle and'accoutrements. Then the Beaver assured&#xD;
him of his hearty approbation of his daughters's conduct.&#xD;
"I bear your people no grudge," he said, "although the red men have received&#xD;
many injuries at their hands. Fr that however, I hardly blame 'them; they&#xD;
act the part of the song against the weak, ot the many against the few. ,Ihe&#xD;
Great Spirit has willedit so.  the case were reversed, the red man would do,&#xD;
as, the white man does. 'I foresee the destruction of my race and my'heart is&#xD;
heavy at the thought,; but I am too feeble, to stem the cur-ent and therefore&#xD;
ready to yield to its force. My people blame me for this'; they set themselves&#xD;
against the progress of the white man and in the foolish attempt fritter'away&#xD;
their{strength. They will kill a few, of cour.ge, but what does it all amount to?&#xD;
You cannot dry the ocean with a dipper, nor scrape down the mountain with the&#xD;
hunting knife.  The white people are countless as the sand on the seashore,&#xD;
and the poor Indian must dwindle away before him--a few generations and&#xD;
you will see him no more."&#xD;

Tye  pale- aces are at war with:the Delawares now; but their enmity will not&#xD;
last forever.  Robert hasna wigwam Torra squaw nova; but hen the war.is&#xD;
over, hewill have one. The Beaver entiot spare his daughter now; because&#xD;
he wanders about from' place to place and 'has no one.to prepare his:food and&#xD;
4his couch, if -his..daughter leaves him. Butwhen the var is odei;he'cap&#xD;
i&amp;amp;me backto the banks of'the Beaver, where the'bones of his fathers lay bur-&#xD;
reed.,  He can then spare his daughter= the Wild Ruse because he can live&#xD;
near his'daughter's wigwant and she.can tend to his wants as b-efore' Spek&#xD;
is the'Wild Rose right?"&#xD;
"1ly daughter is, very wvise for one so young;" the chief gravely replied.&#xD;
yhat does my daughterpropose?"P&#xD;
Robert asked:no questions. His heart had already told 'hinthe meaning of&#xD;
her words. He looked at her reproachftilly but the aiden smiled at him her=&#xD;
sweetest smile, as if in that way she meant to ask his forgiveness and then re-&#xD;
sumed:&#xD;
' Why; if her husband cannot take her, and, her -father cannot spare her,&#xD;
what can the Wild Rose do better, than stay at present, here she is? Surel-,&#xD;
thephief .her; father, would 'not close his door against his daughter?'&#xD;
The smile stealing, over and.brightening the face of the Beaver was sufficient&#xD;
answer. Before.he: couldreply in words, Robert exclaimed half sadly half' re&#xD;
proachfully:&#xD;
"Rose, you surely cannot love me, or you would not propose to leave me&#xD;
now! "It is fair to ha'e sh wn me -the garden, of Eden merely to closets gates&#xD;
upon mel"&#xD;
The girl rose -andseizing-h'is hand knelt down before him:&#xD;
"I ot love you?" she said with a deep convincing  stress.' 'ave&#xD;
not given myself to you beforeithe whole trib'? -Hawe I not violated the yi aes of&#xD;
girlish :shyees to save four.life? What= must I' do to convince yoti? Plui"e&#xD;

lay'down myy life :- you.' Scold me, abuse me, but oh! never, never gain'&#xD;
doubt'the fondness of the Wild Rose for her husband."&#xD;
These words were uttered with an emphasis doubly impressive, because it&#xD;
was tempered .with the sweet submissive' resignation peculiar to the Indian fe-&#xD;
male. On' *Robert it had a most powerful effect. He drew the kneeling form&#xD;
into his-arms and pressing it most fervently to his hear, merely murnured:&#xD;
 "Forgiveme,,Rose, forgive me.""&#xD;
The maiden -gently disengaged herself.&#xD;

with the hunter and though there was not mugh danger of the couple&#xD;
being noticed by the Indians, bent upon early starting on their western jour-&#xD;
ney, the maiden chose such by;-ways, as were least calculated tosbing them im&#xD;
contact with the tribe. When they reachedthe forest, they waandered hand in&#xD;
hand, when the nature of the ground would permit it. Their hearts were too&#xD;
full and their thoughts too busy, to spek mth. The novelty -of the situation&#xD;
might also add to their disposition to indulge ina pensive mood and the fear of&#xD;
uttering, the fatal word "farewell" bind their tongues.  Their hands firmly&#xD;
united, with now and.then a loving glance into each others eyes, they Wandered&#xD;
through the forest, until they putthe distance of a mla between- themselves&#xD;
and the village. Further than this Robert-would not Ist his consort go. With&#xD;
a manly effort he suppressed all selfish feelings, and stopping suddeal , he&#xD;

press into the corner of her eye. "My dear good husbandphn! pooh!-dma&#xD;
dead and buried poor soul."&#xD;
He is-is he?"&#xD;
"-Yes, Dave, -and he left a poor helpless widow too. I had just enough to&#xD;
bury him and to travel across the mountains and here I ahm almost worn ut&#xD;

In saying this he had taken a rapid steptoWards the girl; but in consequence&#xD;
of his uic linty stopped both his words and'motions.&#xD;
"Indeed. Dave," trace responded with an eager tone and nod of her head,&#xD;
" she is nobody else, but your own daughter Rose and a good darling girl in&#xD;
the bargain, I assure you.&#xD;
"And that you only tell me now, you silly woman!" the scout exclaimed,&#xD;
folding the hesitating girl into his arms.  "My dear,' my darlin' daughter&#xD;
stands near 'me without my arms openin' for a welcome! Alas, mypoor Rose,&#xD;
many a year haspassed since last my eye dwelled on your countenance. So&#xD;
'tis, no wonder,that you have grown out of my sights You have your mother's&#xD;
features though, Rose, and if I hadn't thought ydu far away, I would have&#xD;
known ypu after all. And so you have c'me, to live with your old fatherin tlye&#xD;

His tend erness ha; in a measure dispelled her shyness. 'Looking with a&#xD;

"If you will let me, yes, dear father.&#xD;
"Let you,of course i shall 'd have called you here before this; oriLy I was&#xD;
afraid, you wouldn't like the wilderness. Say, Rosy, ain't you a little afraid of&#xD;
the red manand his scalping knife?"&#xD;
"fNo 'father, not as long as I am under yiour protection. They tell me the&#xD;
Indians stand in"great awe of your skill' and prowess."  ;&#xD;
'Tut, tut, it does not amount to af much asthat. -Howsomever, I should&#xD;

Ah, their is our fair companion from the bateau; have you reconnoitred&#xD;
your future residence?"7&#xD;
Instead of answering~,ie girl introduced the tvo to one another..&#xD;
"Mr. Campbell--Lieutenant Sanders."&#xD;
"Mr. Campbell," he qaid gaily, "I suppose I have, the advantage over you,&#xD;
for I have'already heard ever so much about you and your doings, while you&#xD;
most'likely have never heard my name .mentioned-simply because I have done&#xD;
nothing yet, to make it. Still,,if you'll have the goodness to initiate Me in the&#xD;
ntysteries of border warfare,PI shall try my best, to do credit to your instruc-&#xD;
tions."&#xD;
Campbell merely bowed assent, not that he lacked words to make a suitabp&#xD;
reply; no, it was rather a vague feelingof, antipathy which filled himp against&#xD;
the attractive stranger, perhaps for no other reason, but simply that he wasat&#xD;
tractive. I do not mean to say that Robert was conscious of any such un-&#xD;
worthy motive, but I am equally sure, that he made no attempt at all to ac-&#xD;
count for his dislike. Human nature is far from being perfect, ,andJIhave np&#xD;
desire whatever to draw the model of a perfect map. Even the best aresub-&#xD;
ject to errors and if the reader in his further intercourse with Robert appbell&#xD;
meets with traits,, which he does not like, I hope he will not forget that Ierdq&#xD;
pict in 'these pages. men as they are, not as they ought to be. The officer di 1&#xD;
not Iseem to be discbu;aged by this lack of cordiality, taking the others silence&#xD;
perhaps for the backw6odman's unintentional diffidence. Rose ApdersonItos- ,&#xD;
ever thought differently. Was it that her woman's perception;hadedisclosejl to&#xD;
her the nature of the scout's feelings or that she herself was, particarIlyinte r;&#xD;
ested in anything concerning the young officer:, she cast at Robert a rapid side&#xD;
'lance at once imploring and inquiri g; Perhaps he. saw it;,before he had&#xD;
time to make a reply either in signs or 'ords, the ieutennt again drev the&#xD;
attention of both upon himself.&#xD;
I have just received orders concerning my men" he said, "and nust ow&#xD;
attend to them. -So you will please excf me. The adage. 'Business beto&#xD;
pleasure' holds good in the Wilderness as. well as in more civilized 9omn- .&#xD;
-ties. My duties will probably fill the re t of the day; but t~o-morrow ~s&#xD;
Rose, you will, I hope, allow'me'to- call at your quarters, and, make '&#xD;
quaintance of Mr. Anderson, who interest me as much on your account;:&#xD;
his own. Util then farewell!"&#xD;
This meeting at once 'changed the nature of the relation between Rose a4&#xD;
Robert. Instead of the gay talkative persons they had left, they returned&#xD;
thoughtful, even pensive, he wondering what this could mean1 she, how much&#xD;
be could possibly have discovered.&#xD;
When they reached the.blockhouse,,the two rooms of whichit consisted, had&#xD;
already assumed a very different aspect. A woman's hand was plainly percep-&#xD;
tjble and to judge from the amountgf work Mrs. Jones-Jones hadbeen hes&#xD;

"It is now nigh on twenty years that this horrible affair occurred. We&#xD;

tined to the cruel fate of losin' my whole family save this one daughter by. the&#xD;
hands of the savage foe, that was then makin' inroads upon the settlements, on,&#xD;
all sides. Unfortunately I was away from home. on business, when the;riews.&#xD;
of their coming' first reached me. Leavin' my business unsettled I hastened home&#xD;
with all speed; but only came in time tg witness the fallin' in ofE- my house,&#xD;
which the savages had set on fire after finishing theirworl of-b"tohevy4"&#xD;
He stopped and his hearers likewise maintained a syrmpatheti silence. =Rose&#xD;
seized the hand of her father, who, touched by4 its token of aftectior, stroked&#xD;
hers in turn. At fast arousing himself from the gloomy mood- into which-thef&#xD;
sad recital had plunged him, he- continued:,&#xD;

"When the fire had died out, we found the charred remains of several grown&#xD;
persons and children showin' that some of the neighbors must have, takeref-&#xD;
uge in my house, only to fall there victims to the fury of the Injus.&#xD;
"And Miss Rosa, how was she saved?" Robert eagerly inquired.&#xD;
"She happened to be out with sister Grace huntin' berries in the woods. To&#xD;
be sure she was -too small to walk herself beind hardly a year old, but Grace&#xD;
would carry her you know. The child was fond of blackberries and in her ins-#.&#xD;

- What a narrow escape!" Robert exclaimed.&#xD;
Y Yes, you may well say so, Mr. Campbell," Grace remarked. "I heard the&#xD;
tumult in the woods, and not knowing what to think of it ran towards:the-house.&#xD;
Reaching the edge of the woods I saw the savages at work and came near&#xD;

"Your gg didnot deceive you, Robert, and here is the piece we fred from.&#xD;
What do y% think of it?"&#xD;

gase -which a lady evines, in playing ' thi her fan, he examinedall its parts&#xD;
with the eye of a judge. . Aftet*listenin  he sharp click of the lock.and rais-_&#xD;
ig the stock repeatedly to his cheek,  1 emphatically:"&#xD;
rPerfect, as far as I can see; this is indeed a splendid gun. Are ,you the&#xD;

"Yes, sir," the Lieutenant replied.  "Mr. Anderson has used it and pr-&#xD;
nounced it good. I should be pleased to have you also try it and o"firm his&#xD;
judgment "&#xD;
"What have you shot at?"-&#xD;
" A crow and a peach," the Ljeutenant replied. Anderson shook hlis head.&#xD;
"sYou oughn't to have toldhim, Lieutenant,",he said laughing. "I kn owhe will&#xD;
laugh at us. He'll consider that childsplay "&#xD;
A barely perceptible smile had indeed played around Robert's lips at the men -&#xD;
tion of the, above words. belt checking himself he said:&#xD;
" I don't know about thatDavid. To hit a crow or,-a peach may be a dif.i-&#xD;
cult' task and again 'a very easy one.  Miss Rose do you see anything that,&#xD;
would justify the wasting of abullet?.'&#xD;
Oh, yes, sir, I do. A good piece beyond the peach tre stands a largetre&#xD;
with little balls on?"                                       getre&#xD;
You mean the sycamore,7-j see it."&#xD;
" Well, on the branch standing but against the river I see a single ball, quite&#xD;
aiwav from all the others.,If yougan hit that, I shall be inclined to credit all&#xD;
the stories the people tell each other about your skill in shooting,"&#xD;
This was said in a tone in, which a trace of defiance was barely perceptible.  rt&#xD;
The young girl was probablysppmewhat nettled at the skill manifested by these&#xD;
foresters, because they showed themselves much superior to one in' whom she.&#xD;
felt a dee   rest.  l eforgtt 'that. the young officer wouldhave come out&#xD;

what the others followed asgaprofession. It annoyed her to see hj?  appear in"&#xD;
an inferisor;character find it , gu's undoubtedly that gavea touch of aninos-&#xD;
ity to her words. Robert se ed to notice it, for he cast at her a wondering&#xD;
glance that made her blush. Then he raised his rifle with the determination&#xD;

gratifiedat    Raising the riflesslowly And carefully he pulled the trigger at&#xD;
themiomen henIthe ball came into the line of vision. A shout of admiration&#xD;
from the bystanders proclaimed his success. Even i Rose it overcame the&#xD;
' previous' feeling of annoyance and the Lieutenant could :noltire of lauding his&#xD;
extraodinary'skill.&#xD;
'  must. confess, this goes beyond' my  rehension," he cried, andiI&#xD;
would- give-a great deal to emulate such skill."&#xD;
"- -    Oh-this is nothing, sir," Anderson exclaimed. "I have seen Robert split a&#xD;
dozen bullets on the'blade of l;is knife, at the distance of a hundred yards."&#xD;
"'I believe it, though I fail to comprehend it."&#xD;
!Itis petty hard to comprehend;.  t difficult as it may appear Lieutenant,&#xD;
the trueagrit of a man is only tested   ie contest' with another man, especiall&#xD;
when that man happe  to have     per-colored skin, and there't is, where&#xD;
the, merits of friend Robert  '  their true light. I tell you- "&#xD;
"I tell you, David, that it' isn't becoming in a white man to brag about him -&#xD;
selt or his friend either." Robert interrupted hins. "So, if you cannot desist&#xD;
I'llago home: and help your sister get the coffee ready-I see her beckonig&#xD;
ver yonder with all her might."&#xD;
Anderson laughed&#xD;
"Well, you shall have your way, Robert," he said, "so don't go away with-&#xD;
out giving us another token of your skill. I wish you could show these people&#xD;
how you pick away a dusky' Indian from behind-a tree, when you see no more&#xD;
of him than what a copper cent would cover; but as that cannot be, shoot at&#xD;
least somethin' that has life. -Bring down one of those gulls that skip albout&#xD;
the river."                                                  z&#xD;
Robert looked at him with a searching glance.&#xD;
"Now David, if I did not know you well, I might harbor the thought that&#xD;
you would catch md in a trap; To hit the'sycamore burr is child's play when&#xD;
compared withthe shooting of a gull; They are nothing but bones and feath&#xD;
ers and I verily believe a bullet might strike through the veyenter of'thei? body-&#xD;
without hitting a vital part:&#xD;
" Why, making' azspeech"a Anderson exclaimed  bile:ismile of satisfaction&#xD;
passed over Rose's face. "- I know well that the=shot'i a ticklish onfe; but I&#xD;
know also- that you have made it a dozen times and rreverfailed. What the:&#xD;
in thein'me of goodness aie you afraid of?"&#xD;
'1am not afraid, David,'andhalbtry'the shot; but antis one whe i hanc&#xD;

giving'you a fair warning.' Give me. a solid mark and I a pretty 1 'e toy ht&#xD;

During these'word Robert had not been idle  He had carefully meagur.&#xD;
the powder constituting the charge of theigun,. and then{ rrnied down 'the,&#xD;

two womeu in their duties, and also disclose to:them the scope of alltherpleas-&#xD;
ures which they could reasonably expect. Grace positivelyrefusedto leavethe&#xD;

*       in the fuliillment of her duties, and the intercourse with those-whom destiny&#xD;
throws in her way.  Rosa fared a little better. Her father, in consequence f ;&#xD;
his frequent scouting expeditions would know tolerably-well when a walk'ixthe&#xD;
woods was fraught with danger, and when not; but even underthe-most-fa  {&#xD;
xorable irumstances she was -strictly forbidden to leave-the Fort; when duty&#xD;
or otht4eircumstances prevented Robert from accompanying -her, 'Lieuteaant&#xD;
Sanders had repeatedly prayed for the removal of this restrictiortbut tQ no pur&#xD;

no doubt sooner or latter make a right good frontiersman.  Attpresenthouw&#xD;

he was sure-the affection for his Indian bride, though deeply burie i his heart&#xD;
had not only not lost its intensity; but even gained in arder. Pe4  the very.&#xD;
nec ssity of this secrecy was instrumental sin keeping the recollection of the&#xD;
lovely'Delaware girl so bright in his bosom..#We have already stated that the&#xD;
trontiersmen held the Indian in supreme contempt and that the mere announce-&#xD;
mRit of a nuptialconnection witl a girl of that race would have exposedob-&#xD;
ert Campbell to such an amount*fraillery, as to make his position entirely un -&#xD;
tenable.  In his first enthusiastic acceptance of the fair girl's proposal, he had&#xD;
not thought of this difficulty; but on reaching his friends and comrades he be-&#xD;
came aware of , and praised the thoughtfulness of the Wild Rose; which had&#xD;
indeed deprived him of the pleasure of her company, but also saved herself&#xD;
from many a painful collision, which even he could not have totally averted.&#xD;
True, white men would in many instances associate with Indian women, with-&#xD;
out the formal ceremony of matrimony"hut Robert on the one hand was too&#xD;
pure for such a practice, which from the ignorance~of the civilized habits on the&#xD;
part of Wild Rose, might have been practicable, and on the other he bore too&#xD;
deep and ardent an affection for that maiden to, insult her memoryEby even the&#xD;
thought of such a step. No, she was too pure and lovely, to be drawn into the.&#xD;
mire of the world and while he rejoice in her good sense, that had given him&#xD;
time to make. the necessary preparations for her reception to his heart and&#xD;
bosom, he was fully resolved to give her in his future home the sacred position,&#xD;
of a christian wife.&#xD;
While these feelings continued in the deeper current of his heart, others of a&#xD;
rather contradictory nature floated on the surface.  They had all sprung from&#xD;
the arrival of Rosa Anderson, the daughter of the man, who up to the moment&#xD;
of his recent love, had held the warmest place in his heart, He and kobert&#xD;
pursue   k same vocation, hunted the same game, scoured the same- woods&#xD;
for theaije dusky foe and in spite of their disparity of years, shared such a&#xD;
resemblance of opinions, hopes and aspirations, that a firm friendship must.&#xD;
needs be the unavoidable result.&#xD;
l.Rosa was the only object they had thus far not owned in common and the&#xD;
desire of Anderson to see his friend and daughter united in wedlock, is suffi-&#xD;
cient evidence that he was willing to share with him the greatest treasure in his-&#xD;
possession.&#xD;
Before Rosa's arrival he had spoken about her only in general terms; but&#xD;
since this event his allusions had become so frequent and his hints so pointed&#xD;
that Robert labored under a constant.embarrassment.  He could not think of&#xD;
revealing to his'friend his relation to the Indian girl, and consequently could&#xD;
not explain to him the impossibility of listening to his proposals. So he simply&#xD;
contented himself with preserving a total silence on the subject, never dream-&#xD;
ing that Anderson would construesthis silence as diffidence and bashfulness,&#xD;
which could and must be overcome by frequent allusions to and conversations,&#xD;
un the subject. In that way.'t situation of the young, hunter became more&#xD;
emburassm; every day, for  t rupture with Anderson, which amutual&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
53&#xD;
&#xD;
e   nation was almost sure to bring a out, there was the dislike of.the daugh-&#xD;
teandthe jealousy-of the Lieutenant* Rosa and her opinion were by no means&#xD;
indifferent to our friend. ° He had fpm the beginning conceived a liking} for.the&#xD;
beautiful and clever girl, which -ght have-changed :intolove; if he had met&#xD;
her before instead of after the ad entire related in:the-first chapter of this story.&#xD;
We ae:creatures rof circumstances and the much :talked of 'decrees of tate&#xD;
mostly}dwindled into the results of circumstances, when we examine them&#xD;
through the microscope QI truth.- Robert imagined he discovered in the daugh-&#xD;
ter of the scout a softer image of the Indian girl; her beauty, intellect and-char-&#xD;
acter tempered as it were by civilization.. Even the name remi ded him of the&#xD;
Wild Rose and he loved to hear and pronounce it:. He looked at the young&#xD;
girl in the Fort, much as We look at a mirror reflecting the traits and features&#xD;
of one we lve.&#xD;
Under these, circumstances we need not wonder, that the young man con-&#xD;
geived a warm.affection for Rose, and was considerably nettled at the indiffer-&#xD;
ence'she manifested towards him.  Man is at best a strange enigma. While&#xD;
our friend feared, and endeavored to.check the disposition ofthe father to be-&#xD;
stow upon him the hand of the daughter, he was at the-same time eager, in a&#xD;
measure; to   the daughter's good wi# although her-coldness'increased just&#xD;
in proporti  o his eagerness., He had a pretty accurate .idea of the relation&#xD;
between. Rosa anil the Lieutenant, and he felt a pang of jealousy without lov-&#xD;
ing-her. Perhaps this was not fair, nor approaching the noble and exalted feel-&#xD;
ing we love to. read about; but I repeat it, that I draw a picture, and that he-&#xD;
who- expects no dross in. the composition of human nature, however noble,&#xD;
shows a sad want of human knowledge, Robert did not love Rose Anderson,&#xD;
but he would not have objected, to have been .a little loved by her. Nor&#xD;
-    could fe get himself to look with favor upon o man who ventured t&amp;amp;-spire to&#xD;
something that ha4 been set aside for him. B ides it was mortifying to think,&#xD;
that- Rose had bestowed her affections on the l ieutenant in preference'to him,&#xD;
forgetting the all important circumstance, that she, like him,/had fixed her&#xD;
choice before he entered into competition. 'Be this as it may, there is no de-&#xD;
nying -the fact, that Robert Campbell, regarded the Lieutenant with rather, an&#xD;
unfavorable eye, and the. only thing we can ,ay in extenuation is, that he was&#xD;
not more than half way by the latter.  Rose saw the growing animosity be-&#xD;
tween the young men,.and in spite of the natural gayety of her 'disposi'on, she&#xD;
could not help viewing the future sometimes with gloomy forebodings. Noe&#xD;
were her father's-continual discourse on the merits -of the hunter calculated ti&#xD;
improve her :humor, and so the six months following her arrival at the Fort&#xD;
were less fraught with comfort and happiness than everybody had anticipated.&#xD;
True the glorious-season of the fall has nany a pleasant walk into the forests.&#xD;
Rose had witnessed= the hunting. of the'turkey and the deer; she had with&#xD;
Robert-alone, or occasionally in company of both- the hunter and Lieutenant&#xD;
paid visits to the old-Indian town, situatedabout half a mile below the Fort,&#xD;
and showing .the ruins of many on-ce substantial houses. At some places the&#xD;

The woods around the Fort abounded with wild fruit of evety description .&#xD;
Besides th'e peaches gross' ing on the seedlings we have mentioned, thereve&#xD;
wild plums and grapes, and 'various sorts. of nuts in the greatest abunddaice.&#xD;
Robert and Anderson had made maple sugar in the spring, and a considerable'&#xD;
store of it being still on hand, Grace and Rose tried their hands at'preserving,:&#xD;
the scarcity ofgears alone limited their industry in this direction. Anddrson&#xD;
much enjoyed the increased comforts of his household.! H  alone seemed to be&#xD;
blind to the clouds gathering on the horizon of his domestic sky. When the&#xD;
tea which his sister had brought with her was exhausted, he expressed such-&#xD;
regret that Grace was "obliged to have recourse to such experience as her for-&#xD;
iner frontier life had given her. , She sent her brother to the woods-Ito gather'a&#xD;
plentiful supply of wild strawberry leaves, telling him that she intended to dry&#xD;
them and during the comingwinter make tea of them, strawberry leaves being&#xD;
an excellent substitute fot thie genuine article. It was amusing, to -see how&#xD;
readily he entered into her plans, and[f the members of the h ,P hold had&#xD;
been versed in ancient lore, the picture ofHercules spinning-at t  t of Om+&#xD;
hale would undoubtedly have risen before their vision. In his leisure hours&#xD;
he helped to lay up great stores of nuts and fruit-,and when Grace complained&#xD;
of the scarcity of vessels-for preserving purposes, he went to the commander of&#xD;
the post and begged him to order, at the scout's expense; such a quantity' of&#xD;
stoneware to be brought down the river in the next 'flatboat ,that the Captain&#xD;
wondered and laughed at his extravagance. This, however, failed to'annoy&#xD;
the-scout, who probably thought that two householdswould require supplying&#xD;
before long.&#xD;
In Anderson's presence tlie whole family-in which Ve have to -include Rob-&#xD;
ert-put on their gayest faces, -Grace, with true womanly instinct, would have'&#xD;
soon divined the condition of her neice's heart and the state of -aftairs arising&#xD;
therefrom; but, Rose from the beginning had made her.a cdnfident;i, Grace had'&#xD;
of course, shared the civilities of' the Lieutenant on the journeyyand' conse-&#xD;
quently conceived a friendship for hini, which induced her to' receive the over- \&#xD;
tures , ler neice with complaisance, and assume:the character of a protectress.&#xD;
ftheiriove. Knowing her brother, and perceiving, with a woman's instinct,&#xD;
thtt an open avowal or direct opposition to his .wishes would not answer, she&#xD;
managed, with considerable skill and seeming undesignedness to advocate the'&#xD;
interests of the Lieutenant.. Nor had she a difficult. task, for: Lieutenant San-&#xD;
ders was in every respect a worthy young man; and as time passed away, the&#xD;
prejudice which the scout entertainedagainst the =order wore-offin favor of the&#xD;
individual. He was glad to receive the Lieutenant in his house, for in:thelong&#xD;

ture just low enough to keep the snow from melting. When they reachedhe&#xD;
ravine, into which the hole opened, thepbsence of all tracks proved to a ce'-&#xD;
tainty that Mr. Bruin was safe at' home. The dogs got the scent and became&#xD;
restless, barking at the hole. Robert told' e. Lieutenant to get his rifle-ready&#xD;
nd then encourage the dogs to enter. The two men took their positions a lit-&#xD;
tle up and down the ravine, the opposite ledge being too steep for even a bear to&#xD;
climb. Meanwhile the dogs had kept upa furious barking,;rushing in and out&#xD;
of the cave in their eager endeavors to arouse and attack their enemy. All at&#xD;
once the bark of one of them changed into a howl and the hunter saw him jump&#xD;
from the hole in as great a haste as an injured leg would allow him.&#xD;
"Now watch, Lieutenant," Robert cried, " the bear has broken Nero's leg.&#xD;
He is surely up and I should not be surprised to see him out."&#xD;
The words had scarcely been spoken when two bears instead of one-trotted&#xD;
from the entrance of the cave and at the sight of the hunters began to growl in&#xD;
an angry manner. They saw that their retreat was cut oft and for a moment&#xD;
seemed to hesitate as to the best course to pursue. When, on a sudden, they&#xD;
wheeled towgrds the left, in the direction of the Lieutenant and tried to make their&#xD;
escape down the run.&#xD;
The ravine was rather narrow and Robert began to fear for the-safety of the&#xD;
Lieutenant. He would gladly have fired and thus dispatched onrsf the bears,&#xD;
but as they turned their rear towards him, he could not reach a vitdl spot with&#xD;
his bullet. At this moment the Lieutenarit fired and thereby for a moment&#xD;
checked the progress of the animals.  One of the bears was evidently badly&#xD;
wounded. for he began to growl in the most savage manner and rising on his&#xD;
hind legs marched towards the young officer with his jaws apart and his fore-&#xD;
feet extended for a friendly hug. The other bear imitated his example, thereby&#xD;
exposing the vital spot, where the neck joins the back. Quickly the scout rais-&#xD;
ed his rifle and fired,-and tie report had hardly died away when the bear fell,&#xD;
expirinalmost at the same moment. Robert, however, took no time to-exam-&#xD;
ine him for the other bear had meanwhile closed with the officer. Fortunately&#xD;
the man made no efforts toward him off, or the wounded animal might have&#xD;
badly torn his shoulders in the attempt to draw him in a deadly embrace. Too&#xD;
brave to run; the Lieutenant had,'on the approach of the bear, drawn his hunt'-&#xD;
ing knife andjtabbed him in the belly. His want of experience, however, had&#xD;
caused him to miss the right spot and.the stab apparently had no other effect&#xD;
bul to increase the fury of the animal. Hugging the Lieutenant, it endeavored&#xD;
j ,tgc strangle ,hirm to death, and,,as the handle of the -knife had broken off in the-.&#xD;
Spressure,leaving the young man defenceless, there is no knowing how success-&#xD;
ful its attempts might have been wi t  the interference f the scout. Run&#xD;
ne                                teing up to fhe strugglinghcouple he drove his knife up to e hilt into the bear,&#xD;
piercing his heart and causing him to relax his grasp almost instantaneously.&#xD;
In so doing he fell, drawing the Lieutenant to the ground. Robert, however,&#xD;
seized him by the arm and helping him to arise inquired in anxious tone ''heth-&#xD;
er he warhurt.&#xD;

THE WILD ROSE ,0F THE WEAVER.               57&#xD;
"#No, I am not," replied the young officer, drawing a deep breath, " but I&#xD;
haye an idea I soon-would have been without your tirmely interference. I am&#xD;
indeed deeply indebted to you and may-congratulate myself for not having un-&#xD;
dertaken this adventure alone."&#xD;
-Welly : dont know. If youhad been alone, the, avenue would not have&#xD;
been barred:and the bears would certainly have endeavored to give you the \&#xD;
slip. The trouble was, that we only looked for one bear and yet found two.&#xD;
That was almost too much of a blessing."&#xD;
"And what arewe going to do with these fellows?"&#xD;
"I think we had better skin and, quarter them and hang the meat into the&#xD;
trees. We can then, at our leisure,-get assistance from the Fort to remove it."&#xD;
"So we can.. The men will be glad ;enough to get a chance at bear meat."&#xD;
.This programme was followed out and from that day a better understanding&#xD;
seemed to prevail between the two young men. There was no verbal expla-&#xD;
nation, nor did the connection ripen into a friendship. They spoke to one an-&#xD;
other occasionally, hunted together and thus passed through the latter part of&#xD;
the winter more-pleasant than the first. The Lieutenant meanwhile perrected&#xD;
himself in the art of hunting and woodcraft generally, and more tan once by&#xD;
his aptness and docility drew ,words of praise (rom the lips of Anderson, yho&#xD;
seemed not only- to have conquei-ed his dislike, but even conceived a fondness&#xD;
for the young man.&#xD;
When. the first signs of mild-weather showed themselves, the family iade the&#xD;
most extensive preparations for the manufacture of maple sugar. In the leis-&#xD;
ure fours of winter Anderson and CampYbell had-cut and hewed troughs, des-&#xD;
tined to receive the sweet liquid and their example had proved contagious to&#xD;
many of the soldiers. So when the sugar time arrived, the whole garrison 'vas&#xD;
thrown into commotion. Hundreds of trees were tapped and every kitchen of&#xD;
the Fort was stripped of ;buckets and kettles to carry and boil'down the pre-&#xD;
cious liquid, nature's spontaneous offering. The rilt wa in proportion to the&#xD;
S fort. Never before had so much sugar been manufactured in the fort. The&#xD;
shelves of: Anderson's kitchen showed large cakes without number, and as the&#xD;
first bateau. coming down the river'after the Opening of navigation brought the&#xD;
ordered jars and jugs, the face of Grace shone with ecstasy of delight, and ,the&#xD;
was incessantly laying her plans for the preserving of immense quantities of&#xD;
/ every description of fruit attainable'in that neighborhood. Wit these prepa-&#xD;
rations and speculations time flew rapidly, and before the family was fully&#xD;
aware of it every vestige of winter had disappeared and a thin veil of pale green&#xD;
begun to adorn the woods. Spring always gladdens the heart of man, :nd so,&#xD;
it could not fail that at its arrival tho Fort assumed a gayer aspect. To increase&#xD;
the gladness of its inhabitants, the above mentioned flatboat also brought the&#xD;
news of the surrender of Cornwallis. It was rather late, the surrender having&#xD;
taken place fully six months before; but that did not prevent the garrison from&#xD;
enjoying. it as much. The six pounder was fired and the forest made to ring&#xD;
with its report and the cheers of the men. 'Everything bore the aspect f u&#xD;

- CHAPTER VIII&#xD;
AN EXCUSABLE MISTiAR ,&#xD;
In tas in the early part of April; when at the break of dawn teutenant San-&#xD;
ders left the Fort, He had the evening before obtained leave for a day's ab-&#xD;
sence, without'stating to any one the nature of his errand, While oituthateday&#xD;
with a party of soldiers 'some three miles up the river, he -had lotid dbte&#xD;
large footprints of an animal on the moist ground near the bank and onn'iir&#xD;
learned froA his men 'that they originated with a panther. A panther  I '&#xD;
had never seen, much less hunted this animal, and the stories which the sol-&#xD;
diers told about its ferocity and strength fiJled him with the burning'desire to&#xD;
meet and conquer it. a So when one of his companions told him that athicket&#xD;
near the river, about two miles further up, was 'the usual abode of-a large pan,&#xD;
other, he at once forhied the resolution to o tit in search of 'it: In the bear&#xD;
hunt Robert Campbell had borne of the palm, while the Lieutenantihad run the&#xD;
greatest risk and in order to-avoid aerepetition of this undesirable division he&#xD;
resolved to keep the risk and the glory both for himself this time. However,&#xD;
he had !n idea, that th- reaping of dlory was by no  s a cCr'in thing.&#xD;

THE WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Brother? As, yes, exactly, I recollect that you are all one great big family&#xD;
out here. Brother let it be then, and if one of your propositions is correct, I&#xD;
suppose the other will not be far wrong either. You look young and innocent&#xD;
for it anyhow."&#xD;
The Indian seemed merely to have. understood a part of the last sentence;&#xD;
at least he replied to it only..-&#xD;
"Me no young."  he said gravely; me young warrior now-great warrior&#xD;
soon!"&#xD;
"Granted, Mr. Indian, as contradiction is a violation of goodbreeding. Yes,&#xD;
sir,.granting all that, I might take the liberty perhaps of asking you the ques-"&#xD;
tion: What are you doing here?"&#xD;
" Me here home; this Indians land," he said with considerable emphasis.&#xD;
"Aye, aye! that assertion can hardly be gainsayed. But then having for-&#xD;
feited your claims by emigration, I must repeat the question: What are you&#xD;
doing here?"&#xD;
The Indian saw from this repetition that his reply was not satisfactory.- So&#xD;
shrugging his shoulders, he said very coolly: " Me take a little walk."&#xD;
little walk?  Why I know no Indian settlements twenty miles around&#xD;
here."&#xD;
Was not, but will be! Indian come make peace."&#xD;
" Ah, is that the way! Still your people would hardly choose so young an&#xD;
envoy, would they?"    .&#xD;
",No! Indian no send me. Old man on way-me come alone."&#xD;
"That's what I expected., But you have not answered my question yet; if&#xD;
you cannot satisfy me as to your intentidns, you must follow me to the Fort."&#xD;
This the youth did not relish. He shook his head, Iaying eagerly: " No&#xD;
Fort! me good Indian, good friend of white man!"-&#xD;
Of course you say so-still I am doubtfulwhether I can believe you."&#xD;
"Yes, believe. Me friend, me run if like."&#xD;
"I guess not, my friend,"\ the Lieutenant replied drily. " My gun would&#xD;
soon put a stop to that."&#xD;
"No, no, leaves thick, water deep. The Red Fox creep and swim. He&#xD;
gone much long, if wanted."&#xD;
" And why didn't you then, my good friend?"&#xD;
"Yes, good friend! much good friend. Me see brother, me like him. So y&#xD;
come out speak, shake hands."&#xD;
With these words and a genuine smile on his regular, well proportioned fea-&#xD;
tures, he stepped nearer to the other and extended his hand with so much good&#xD;
grace and unmistakable uprightness, that the Lieutenant felt ashamed to show&#xD;
any more distrust. He received and shook the young Indian's hand and said:&#xD;
" My young friend is welcome. Hashe any'of his people with him!"&#xD;
"iNo, Red Fox all alone. Him sly and cunning. Him creep through little&#xD;
hole."&#xD;

"No, -e take no gun. Me see big game, me want shoot!"&#xD;
"Ant1 why shouldn't you shoot?"&#xD;
"Too much white man, not all good, some bad. Hear Red Fox shoot--&#xD;
come, take-scalp."&#xD;
"Well, yes, that might be the case. But, tell me Red Fox, have you seen&#xD;
no sign of a panther here?"&#xD;
" Yes, me kill one.",&#xD;
"The deuce, you did! How could you kill a panther without a gun?"&#xD;
" Me knife, -stickshim in belly.now,"&#xD;
With this he pointed to the thicket,&#xD;
"In'there?" the astonished officer inquired. " You are making sport of me.&#xD;
"No sport-all earnest. Come see!"&#xD;
After this laconic invitation he stepped into the bushes and parting them ex-&#xD;
posed'to view the body of a full sized panther, which had evidently come to&#xD;
death by wounds inflicted with a knife still sticking in the body.&#xD;
" And you are not even wounded?"&#xD;
"No wounded-just scratched" he said with a smile, exhibiting a gash on&#xD;
his arm, for which many a dandy of modern times might keep 'his bdfor&#xD;
weeks.&#xD;
"An ugy scratch, indeed, my boy," said the Lieutenant with muchni re&#xD;
sympathy in his voice than before. "Come, let me bind it up a little better."&#xD;
The Indian seeing the kind intent, at once offered his arm, which the Lieu-&#xD;
tenant bandaged as well as he could. This done he said; " You are a fine&#xD;
lad that's sure, and I hardly know whether I am more pleased with your bra-&#xD;
very or vexed at your interference with my calculations. Are there no more&#xD;
panther's about here?"&#xD;
"Not very near; but me give skin to Blue Coat; me only want claws."&#xD;
"Ah, you are smart enough, I see. You can more safely brag with the claws&#xD;
than with the skin. However, I accept your present and'may as well proceed&#xD;
without delay to'secure it."  -&#xD;
- The Indian helped the Lieutenant, and in a few minutes they had severed&#xD;
the skin from the carcass. .It was, bleeding some yet and so the young man&#xD;
hung it on tie low branch of a tree to let the blood drip off. This required&#xD;
some time and the walkhaving sharpened his appetite, he seated himself on ai&#xD;
$   old log lying close by and inviting the Indian to his side, offered him a portion&#xD;
of his breakfast. The Red Fox accepted the bread and steak" with a good&#xD;
enough grace; but the Lieutenant's flask with whisky, brought a perfect radi-&#xD;
ance of happiness on his face. When Sanderssaw it, he at once handed the&#xD;
bottle to his new friend who put it to his.mouth and emptied it of part of its&#xD;
contents with a readiness, showing either considerable skill or great relish.&#xD;
When the Lieutenant noticed it, a thought struck,.him. Receiving the.bottle&#xD;
from the Indian's hand, he merely pretended to take a dram, leaving in 'reality&#xD;
the whole contents to the Indiani who managed to finish it in the very short&#xD;
period o fifteen miitates. It was go'd strong whiskey, and as the fi k &amp;amp;y&#xD;

-      intoxication. For this the Lieutenant had nly waited 1  ra frap bhp any&#xD;

VWhat tribe did you say that you belonged to?" he began to 'ask.&#xD;
dhe Delaware, great nation, grandfather of all--ndjats."&#xD;
"Exactly, but you came here for apurpose, did you pot?"&#xD;
The Indian endeavored to look very cuilning, but only succeeded-,nlooking&#xD;
ery stupid: " Me go see white brother at.fort,"&#xD;
Ah, then yod have acquaintances there! Who is it young krpwthere? '&#xD;
"Me know Big Jump, great warrior."&#xD;

" He have fine squaw, too; take Wild Rose to his wigwam."&#xD;

Wild Rose; you know too."&#xD;
"I know a Rose, to be sure, though as to wildness, I ean't see much of&#xD;
* that."s&#xD;
"Rhse very beautiful."&#xD;
I readily subscribe to that." -&#xD;
':She Big Jump's *quaw soon."&#xD;
Indeed she won't!" the Lieutenant exclaimed energetically. He knew only&#xD;
one Rose; yes, it may be said in truth, for hihn there was only one Rose. in ex-&#xD;
i;tence; so when the Indian spoke of Rose, he naturally thought big-Zo&#xD;
dlude to his Rose. The reader nay therefore imagine his surpriseat:the I-&#xD;

F  he Indian, however, did not suffer his opinion -to h shaken or altered.&#xD;

64 '=lE WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVER.&#xD;
-stare, and-in vain t'  to obtain a connected-recollection of the morning's ad-&#xD;
venture. He knew be had met a white man, he knew that he had k ofeely'&#xD;
of tie dangerous firewater, and he had a vague idea that fheo hallowed his&#xD;
tongue to run at random. He felt heartily ashamed of himself,for the Indian&#xD;
considers the breach of trust one of the meaniest of things, provided the profes-&#xD;
sion was not merely made as a ruse, to draw a foe intoa snare. Comforting&#xD;
himself at least with the idea that he had4'revealednothig of importance, and&#xD;
that the part revealed would remain without serious consequences for himself&#xD;
and his friends, he arose; and after adjusting his simple toilet pursued his&#xD;
course towards the Fort.&#xD;
It was night when he reached the brow of the hill from which. his eye could&#xD;
look on the plain on which the Fort was situated.: Fearing to draw too near&#xD;
in the darkness and knowing, moreover, that he couk not then communicate&#xD;
with Big Jump-for such was his intention-he gathered himself some moss in&#xD;
a cluster of bushes and stretched his limbs on this, rough bed, courted sleep to&#xD;
close his eyelids. But the nap during the day prevented the drowsiness, which&#xD;
usually besets us at break of night and the young Inian for several boyrs&#xD;
rolled restlessly about. It was after midnight when h finally fell asleep and&#xD;
so we need not wonder, that at sun rise he still revelled in the realm of dream*.&#xD;
The lad wondered considerably,-when all at once: he was recalled to conscious-&#xD;
ncss by the rough contact of the stock of a rifle with his body.&#xD;
"Get up, you vagabond," a voice sounded in his ear caused hin tp spring to&#xD;
his. feet with the rapidity of thought. 'A deep mortification filled his breast:&#xD;
twice within the space of a few hours had he suffered himself to be outwitted.&#xD;
If this leaked out to his Indian friends, would they not with contempt look gpon&#xD;
him so weak and unreliable a youth! Would they not hereafter refuse to even .&#xD;
honor him again with any commission of trust andconfidence? In consequence&#xD;
ofthese thoughts he preserved a sullen silence, not even looking at the man&#xD;
who had so roughly interrupted his sleep. ' A second inquiry uttered in a sharper&#xD;
tone, was necessary to make him raise his eyes, No sooner, however, had he&#xD;
beheld the person standing before him when his mien of dejection changed first&#xD;
into one of wonderment, and then of joy.&#xD;
"Ugh!" he exclaimed' in his native tongue, "Big Jump."&#xD;
"The Big Jump! Whotn you mean with such ambiguous appellation?"&#xD;
Yes. my brother is a Big J~ump,"he can leap the'bed of rivers."&#xD;
- "Ah!" the other exclaimed, a smile stealing over his features. "You allude&#xD;
to the ticklish jump I made last summer.. Well, I declare, Inever thoughtthat&#xD;
that leap would help me to .a name and such.a dubious one.  But I haveait,&#xD;
and I suppose it will stick to me likepitch, so there is no use in trying to shake&#xD;
it off. But what are you-doing here my young friend?"d&#xD;
The reader understands already, that the.Big Jump is nobody but friend&#xD;
Robert. Obedient to the orders of the commander, he had as usual begun his&#xD;
morning round and striking the Indian's trail followed it to its teriinus. This&#xD;
ti# th youth showed no hesitation in ans vering the question. Seeing in his&#xD;
&#xD;
The face of the scout became almost radiant with delight on hearing these&#xD;
pleasant news.&#xD;
"Here!" he exclaimed. "The Wild Rose did not say that she would meet&#xD;
me here?"&#xD;
"No, not here; she will be on the summit of the ig knob yonder, when the&#xD;
sun turns its face towards the west."&#xD;
"pu mean at noon?"&#xD;
"My brother has said it."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Big Jump is a gr t warrior. He jumps the beds of rivers;.he follow the&#xD;
trail of the red man l e a hound; he hears the message of the Wild Rose far&#xD;
oft; he has spoken ,,the truth; the Wild Rose sends the Red Fox to' her white&#xD;
friend, the-131g Jump."&#xD;
The boy smiled.&#xD;
The sensitive ear of Robert no longer shrank at that: dubious name; in his&#xD;
estiniation heA had never heard a sweeter voice than that of the messenger&#xD;
while making his statement. He grasped the hand of thelad with a friendly&#xD;
pressure aidf said: "My young friend, the Red Fox, is very welcome. - It is&#xD;
well he has fallen in with his friend, the BigJump, or he might have got into&#xD;
difficulties.  -&#xD;
Now the Indian took great care, not to reveal the disagreeable blu ders of&#xD;
the day before. ' It suited him better to boast before the Big Jump and so he did&#xD;
boast.&#xD;
,The Red Fox is not afraid," he said, drawing himself up .He can creep&#xD;
through the bushes like his namesake and avoid the gaze of the white man.&#xD;
Robert' smiled, for it struck him that a white man had without muchdifficulty&#xD;
tracked the .Red Fox but a minute ago. But paying no attention to'this in-&#xD;
congruity, he asked: - "And what message does the Wild Rose send to me?"&#xD;
She loves Big Jump very much," the youth said with a cun'ning smile, at&#xD;
which the white-man could 'not help blushing.&#xD;
"Did she say so?" heinquired.&#xD;
"No, but the Red Fox has his eyes open; he can see,".        "&#xD;
"But 'that is not the question now.  I do not want to knew what the Red&#xD;
Foi saw but what he heard."&#xD;

wards the Indian lad, he said rapidly and'with emphasis: " The Wild Rose!&#xD;
It is she than:sends you!"&#xD;
&#xD;
Thus corrected, the Indian resumed:' "The Wild Rose will come this way&#xD;

Very well, I    be theie. Tell the.WildeRose I will be there, and it the,&#xD;

"The Red Fox never get, hungry"&#xD;
" But a, good breakfast will, nevertheless be welcome, I reckon," the'scout&#xD;
said, smiling at the extravagance of the boy's expressions. "If theRed Fox&#xD;
will stay here and take good care not to expose himself, I'l go downadfetch '&#xD;
him something. to eat."&#xD;
Without awaitingthe answer, Robert started for the ~rtal d}at the. expirate&#xD;
tion of half an hour returned with a supply of such victuals. as he:had been.&#xD;
able to procure in a hurry. The Indian had fasted since thebreakfast,he had'&#xD;
shared withthe Lieutenant and therefore developed an appetite that didvery&#xD;
will for one that never gets hungry. When he had .dene the scout told him.to,&#xD;
arise  and follow him,leading him by a round about way to the Beaver River&#xD;
in the neighborhood of the falls' ' here all at once a canoe with two Indians&#xD;
attracted his sight, The vessel wa.coming down stream, and the, opepness,&#xD;
with which' the two inruates pursued their course was sufficient evidence that&#xD;
secrecy was not their aim. Still the scout-thought best to conceal his presence&#xD;
from the strangers, until they had approached near enough, to allow a closer&#xD;
examination of their character. Motioning to his companion he entered a&#xD;
cluster of bushes growing on an eminence, from whichvthey had a full view of&#xD;
the approaching craft and the falls or rapids of the river. The canoe was near-&#xD;
ing fast and the two Indians consequently came more plainly to view. All at&#xD;
once the Red Fox touched his companion's arm.&#xD;
"Ugh!" he exclaimed, " I see the-Red Feather and Turtle-Heart."&#xD;
"Upon my word you are right;. one ofthem is the rascal that was so eager&#xD;
for a roast last summer. My fingers itch to send a bullet into his red carcass."&#xD;
"Big Jump must not shoot," the Red Fox earnestly protested. " Maghpi-&#xD;
way goes to Fort to make peace."&#xD;
Robert looked at him indignantly: " What do you mean, sir? Do you think {&#xD;
I shoot unsupecting people from a cover? No, no, my boy, that4is not rpy&#xD;
fashion.  If I say my hand itches, it does not follow that I need yield to the&#xD;
itching. But see, the chief prepares to shoot the falls. That must be an iner-&#xD;
esting sight. 'I have heard that the Indians frequently did it, but I never did it&#xD;
myself hor 'saw it. done. Ah! ,the old fellow manages right handsomely."&#xD;
While he was uttering these words the canoe had indeed entered the rapids:&#xD;
The venture seemed, perhaps more perilous from his elevated standing point,&#xD;
than to the men engaged init. He could see the tossing waters madly rushing&#xD;
over and between the huge rocks and ledges, constituting the bed of the river at&#xD;
that point. He could exactly calculate the course they had to take in order to&#xD;
avoid destruction and involuntarily moved his body in accordance with his cal-&#xD;
culations. - When the canoe had safely passed the. tossing ivhirlpools, he felt&#xD;
greatly relieved and drawing -a deeper breath exclaimed:  "Well done Red&#xD;
Feither! For this handsome piece of seamanship I forgive you your dioody&#xD;
intentions against me. But I must join them, Red Fox; or some one at the&#xD;

"That is a truth, which holds good with the white man as well as the red;&#xD;

possibly saye you some-troubles and risk ih passitig the blockhouse."  .&#xD;
"My brother is welcome. = If him step in canoe, us paddle himi down."&#xD;
In obedience to this invitation the scout stepped into the craft, which shot&#xD;
back into the middle pf=theistrearn and then resumed'its rapid edurse clownrthe&#xD;
creek. On the, present site of New Brighton a. blockhouse-had been. erected,&#xD;
which at that time was garrisoned with a small body of troops: It commanded&#xD;
-  the river and the :two Indians might have found difficulty in passing it, if the&#xD;
.presence of the scout had not protected them. It is more than likely; that the&#xD;
commander of the post had been warned of the probability-of-a similar occur-&#xD;
ence but in those wvild times the life of an Indian was not more highly valued&#xD;
than that ofa dog and the mere instructions of the commianding;officers of the&#xD;
-Fort might in itself have proved a very inefficientsafeguarc. When the canoe&#xD;
passed the building the men showed theirheads at.various openings.&#xD;
You have queer customers there,,Bob,'one of them accosted the scout.&#xD;
Will you give usjleave to pepper away at them?" another added.&#xD;
-If your own skintickles you overpiuch} why not? These Men are under&#xD;
my protection and I suppose you understand what-that means.&#xD;
"Proud like a duke," responded the 'Man laughing.  "But, pass oi, I have&#xD;
no inclination to have my body riddled nor my bones broken."&#xD;
This shows plainly in what estimation the Big'Jump was held by his com1-&#xD;
rades. They knew him to be a steadfast friend, but also a dangerus enemy;&#xD;

the landing of the Fort. - The Vessel was fastened and the party, received by&#xD;
the few idlers, who always more or less lounged about the Fort. - The news of&#xD;
their arrival soon spread amongst the garrison, and when the Indians, in, com-,&#xD;
]any with Campbell, had ascended the covered way, all the' soldiers nat&#xD;
detained by duty, crowded to the gate to see them enter. Tief'bore then&#xD;
selves with a dignified reserve, which never ceased untilthey stood before the&#xD;
commander. Maghpiway, being a chief, thought himself entitled to being re-&#xD;
ceived by his equal, and would have considered a contrary proceeding a slight,&#xD;
or even an insult. When tire Captain, however, bade them welcome, he smiled&#xD;
graciously,and announced himself as an envoy of the Delawares,who-had learned&#xD;
from the Six Nations, that their great fathers in Philadelphia desired to make&#xD;
peace with them. The Delawares were ready to listen to their wishes, he said,&#xD;
and even now are on their way to the Fort to learn the propositions which their&#xD;
white brothers had to make.&#xD;
To this the Captain replied that he was glad to learn the peaceful disposition&#xD;
of the Delawares.  He was also glad to hear that the tribe was coming, and&#xD;
would do everything in his power to make them comfortable. -He wanted the&#xD;
chief to stay and rest from the exertion of his journey, so that after a while he&#xD;
might be able to go back to his tribe, to inform them of the peaceful and&#xD;
friendly disposition of his own and of their great father, the Congress, in Phila:-&#xD;
delphia.&#xD;
After this speech he delivered the guests to Campbell] with the request that&#xD;
they should be made comfortable, and receive every attention which could be&#xD;
shown them under the circumstances.&#xD;
In. obedience to this injunction the scout took them to Anderson's quarters,&#xD;
taking good care to inform the inmates before hand of the -character of the&#xD;
guests. In consequence of this precaution the women were enabled to sup,&#xD;
press all signs of fright, with the exception of a nervous uneasiness, which-&#xD;
worked itself off in an excess of civility and hospitality.  The Indians were&#xD;
made to smoke, te eat, to drink and sleep to their heart's content, and their '&#xD;
countenance's showed plainly how much they appreciated the kindness of their&#xD;
guests. Anderson was in a good humor, and evidently enjoyed the discourse&#xD;
with these savage children of the forest. He recalled numerous reminiscences&#xD;
in which both he and Maghpiway had played role, and laughed just as freely&#xD;
at his o vn discomfitures as those of his guest's; for he had not always been the&#xD;
victorious party in his encounters with the savages.&#xD;
When he alluded to his visit at the Indian village the previous summer,&#xD;
Maghpiway exhibited the slightest possible trace of confusion.&#xD;
My white brother great warrior," he said, perhaps, to coat the ugly re.&#xD;
&#xD;
T#E   1      E OF THE WEAVER.               69&#xD;
.   miniisence over with honey.   ow he escap d1ndians then? Maghpiway&#xD;
never find out."&#xD;
Ah, you would like to know chief, would you?" the scout said, chuckling&#xD;
at the recollection of his fortunate escape, "I supposed you nevet dreamed of&#xD;
the poseib'ility-of a fellow's dodging and giving you the-slip that way?"&#xD;
"'Me-not think it them. Me follow Big Jump. Big Jump-give big cry; make&#xD;
Indians believe he much strong. Then go after Big Jump, catch him-Little&#xD;
Coon run away."&#xD;
Robert broke into a laugh at this :novel appellation of his friend, in which&#xD;
Anderson. himself joined, though he knew henceforth that name would adhere&#xD;
to him as tight as his skin. If he had been a young man and beginner, that&#xD;
name might have injured his reputation'with his red neighbor; as it was they&#xD;
would respect and fear him as much under the sobriquet of Little Coon, sat if they&#xD;
had called him the Big Panther tr drizzly Bear.&#xD;
Whiskey was then an every day beverage, without which no meal was con-&#xD;
sidered complete. We need not wonder then that Andersop freely offered his&#xD;
guests of'the dearly coveted firewater. Nor did they refuse; but in re nember-&#xD;
ance of 'their dignified character as envoys, they for once abstained from de-&#xD;
grading themselves into beastly intoxication. They drank enough to put them-&#xD;
selves into an exceedingly good' humor, a fact, that showed itself by the nu-&#xD;
merous efforts at jokes they made. Red Feather also became aware of the&#xD;
charms of his female hosts, and attempted to sing their praise. Beckoning to&#xD;
Anderson he said:  " My friend has a beautiful daughter; what may be her&#xD;
name?"&#xD;
" We call her Rose, chief."&#xD;
",Rose?" the chief repeated with unusual attention. " That beautiful name'&#xD;
The Rose make fine squaw some day. Big Jump better take her-hitn very&#xD;
fond of roses."&#xD;
The chief looked attentively at the young hunter, who could not help color-&#xD;
ing slightly at this hint, which the others 'of course failed to comprehend. An-&#xD;
derson was well pleased to have a subject. broached. which he had thus tar&#xD;
failed to bring up.           -&#xD;
S      " Well, chief,"lhe cried, "you are not so far wrong there, and your notion&#xD;
proves what I always believed, namely, that you are a clever sort of a fellow.&#xD;
The Big Jump, as you call him, is rather a little shy, but I shouldn't at all&#xD;
wonder if he would sooner or later act on your hint."&#xD;
The rest of the company received thesewrenfrks with a silence, which Would&#xD;
h ve struck both Anderson and the chief as-ominous, if it had come earlier ii&#xD;
t   day. Their frequent potations had indeed failed to upset the balance of&#xD;
their minds, but it had riven them a wonderful capacity for deying everything to&#xD;
assume the color of their wishes. So Anderson received the impression, that&#xD;
the silence of the young people was equal to an assent, and Maghpiway would&#xD;
have sworn that the chance of the Wild Rose for ever becoming the squgw of&#xD;
the -Big Jump was very poor indeed;  Anderson wished a. union betiveeg his&#xD;

cause he was his foe and rival. The discovery of this supposed new attach-&#xD;
:ment of the hunter, not only added to the chief's good humor, but also softened.&#xD;
his animosity against the young man, and caused hint to depart from the Fort&#xD;
the.next day in peace with himself and the whole world. .*&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
-      AN INVOLUNTARY BATH.&#xD;
On the day of Maghpiway's departure from the Fort the deserted Indian vil-&#xD;
lage, in which the reader has first met the Beaver, once more resouhded with&#xD;
the noise of life. Again the chief had led his tribe towards the rising sun; to&#xD;
the hunting grounds of their fathers. The same lodges were occupied by the&#xD;
same families, except .where death with his merciless hand had made such an&#xD;
arrangement impossible. They did not find the dilapidated houses any better-'&#xD;
after their year's absence, and willing or not, the men had to have recourse to&#xD;
the axe and tomahawk, or choose the alternate of seeing the roof tumble in&#xD;
over their heads.&#xD;
The Beaver had done like the-rest. As his house had from the beginning&#xD;
been in a better condition than most of the others, his preparations. were less&#xD;
annoying; but the Wild Rose took good care to save him all trouble, small as it&#xD;
was. The chief had two sons, young men of seventeen and twenty, whose ac-&#xD;
quaintance we made a good while ago, without taking the time to state their&#xD;
relationship to the Beaver 'and the Wild Rose. One of them we have met lately&#xD;
again for the. Red Fox, the messenger of the maiden to the scout, is no lessa&#xD;
person than her brother.and the son of the chief.. The other youth we know as&#xD;
yet but slightly, but may perhaps before long have an opportunity of improving-&#xD;
his acquaintance.  At present, we Are much struck by the mien of deference&#xD;
strangely contrasting with the ready obedience, which--contrary to Indian cus-&#xD;
tom-the two youths observed towards their sister.  She need only say a&#xD;
word to have it carried out ane soy the few repairs .are rapidly effected. The&#xD;
dutiful daughter still further attends to the simple wants. of her father, arrang-&#xD;
ing everything according to his well known tastes and habits; but at last *v-&#xD;
ing done this, she secretly beckons to the Red Fpx and leaves the house.&#xD;
Striking for the woods in the nearest direction, she chose a secluded spot and&#xD;
awaits the arrival of her brother. When she sees him coming she points'to a&#xD;
log ,opposite the one which she sits and begins to inquire about the'result of&#xD;
his excursion. * The, youth had been home for several hours; but so great was&#xD;

yielded to it, whet she foundit toaagriee  ith other and more imperative duties.&#xD;
She is still the brave, noble creature, that with a bleeding heart turned from her,,&#xD;
lover,.to save him=the-pain of a more protracted parting;' as to appearance, sli&amp;amp;&#xD;
is 'eiren rore beautiful than a year-ego. ,Love brings out the charm of the&#xD;
maiden, as the sun does the color of the flower. -The soul having lain as in a&#xD;
trance),awakes, lighting:  the face with the fire of Prometheus, the spark from&#xD;
heaven.&#xD;
Thus the Wild Rose has grown more beautiful; because she has grown more&#xD;
spiritual and'the smile spreading over her countenance, when she first begins&#xD;
to question her brother, is of a truly angelic beauty.        "&#xD;
"M   brother has returned from his errand," she said. - "He has seen him&#xD;
'then?"&#xD;
The .Red Fox has seen and spoken to the Big Jump."&#xD;
"Oh, do not call him so-it is an ugly name."&#xD;
I would gladly exchange mine for his."&#xD;
"fAh, I suppose so;" the girl replied, pleased by this praise of her lover. "To.&#xD;
have his hame the Red Fox would also have to have his qualities."&#xD;
" He -is young'; but some day or other he will have them."&#xD;
" I hope so, I know of no better pattern' for my brother to go by. But what&#xD;
did the Big Jump say?- Did he listen to the message of the Wild Rose?"&#xD;
"Hie listened as the bear to the humming of the bee, the mocking bird to the&#xD;
.    call of its mate.  He said: I love the Wild Rose better than all otter flowers&#xD;
and shall be there to enjoy her sweet perfume."&#xD;
The maiden looked delighted.&#xD;
"And you are sure you gave him the right time and the right place?"&#xD;
"-The Red fox did. Did the Wild Rose ever find him mistake the meaning&#xD;
of her words?"&#xD;
"No, she did not, and I thank him very much, I want him to hold himself&#xD;
in readiness to go with me on the day appointed," '-&#xD;
'The Red Fox will be ready."&#xD;
"Will; he also tell the White Wolf?"&#xD;
-      d"He will, if the Wild Rose is=anxious to take him; but the White Wolf would&#xD;
hate to go; he is-not very fond of the palefaces."&#xD;
"His feelings are-older than his judgment. I want him to go, to rid him-&#xD;
'self of his prejudice."&#xD;
' The Wild Rose has said it; the White Wolf will go."&#xD;
"It is right. I will not forget how good the Red.Fox is to his sister."&#xD;
After these words she rose, blending the dignity of the queen-with' the affection&#xD;
of the sister, in a manner whicliat once explains the great'influence she exer-&#xD;
cised not only over her brother, but many other warriors of the tribe. Even&#xD;
those whose wooing she had rejected, remained her sincere t friends and ad-&#xD;
mirers,'feeling perhaps, that their rough hands were not calculated to handle&#xD;
so delicate a flower, Of these the Red Feather formed the only exception;&#xD;

Although he was the "oldest of her suitors, he had not suffered himself to be&#xD;
discouraged by her original rejection of his proposal. Perhaps he took the re-&#xD;
fusal for mere coyness, which would wear off with a riper age and understand-,&#xD;
ig. It appeared to histconceit as a downright impossibility that a man of&#xD;
such reputation and a chief withal, should be jilted by a girl, who hid hardly&#xD;
passed her teens, and could surely not expect a more honorable connection in&#xD;
the tribe.  The rescue and adoption of Robert Canmpbell on the 'part'of the&#xD;
Wild Rose had first'startled him from his security and opened his eyes to the&#xD;
possibility of'a disappointment of his hopes and expectations. The rage which&#xD;
he felt at this unexpected 'denouncement was, as the reader recollects, only&#xD;
equalled by the hatred-with which from that day he contemplated his enemy,&#xD;
the hunter. True, the Wild Rose travelled in thesame direction;,which neces-&#xD;
sity compelled him to pursue, and, so the chief could afford to defer his ven-,&#xD;
geance to a later day. That day-in his opinion-was drawing near, when'&#xD;
once -more the tribe turned their faces towards the east, choosing him as the&#xD;
messenger of their peaceful disposition. While acting as an envoy, he could&#xD;
not of course strike his foe and therefore made no use of the various&#xD;
chances that offered to injure or destroy him. But he carefully studied the Fort&#xD;
and its surroundings and would no dqubt have matured his plans at an early&#xD;
hour, if the.supposed connection between Campbell and the daughter of David&#xD;
Anderson had not suddenly and unexpectedly turned his thoughts into a new&#xD;
channel and induced him to strive for the consummation of his original designs&#xD;
on the Wild Rose in preference to the satisfaction of his vengeance. The reader&#xD;
recollects thergood humor with which' he departed from the Fort for his native,&#xD;
village, where he arrived during the important conference held in the woods by&#xD;
the Wild Rose and her brother. Having no family to claim his attention at his&#xD;
lodge, Maghpiway at once directed his steps to the hut of the Beaver and-was&#xD;
fortunate enough to find that chief at home. Perhaps his early return was un-&#xD;
expected, for the Beaver started slightly at his sight.&#xD;
"Ugh! the chief has travelled fast; but he is doubly welcome for that reason.&#xD;
Will he sit down and smoke a little before he tells me the result of his errart?"&#xD;
The chief accepted the proffered pipe and after finishing it delivered the mes-&#xD;
sage of the commander at the Fort. The Beaver nodded like a man who sees&#xD;
a thing confirmed, which he expected long ago.  Indeed he was well aware&#xD;
that only the desperate opposition of the.Red Feather had prevented the con-&#xD;
clusion of a treaty a year ago, and his knowledge had indluced him to send&#xD;
.   that chief, thus enlisting the sympathy of the only man that might again prove&#xD;
injurious'to his plans and detrimental to the best interests of the tribe.&#xD;
At this moment 'the Wild Rose entered the room and was ordered by the&#xD;
Beaver to prepare a meal for the hungry envoy. The Red Feather gravely,sa-&#xD;
luted the girl, receiving in turn a more gracious look and pleasant smile than&#xD;
had fallen to his share for a long while. This unexpected reception still&#xD;
strengthened him in his intentions and thus led to the deplorable complication,&#xD;
which well nigh proved fatal to several of our friends, but to hear of which&#xD;

&#xD;
THE WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVER.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVER.                 73&#xD;
may not be unacceptable to-the reader, as they furnish the material for the&#xD;
continuation of our tale.&#xD;
We have often said, that Indians were born statesmen and have now a new&#xD;
-      opportunity to prove this assertion by the skill, with which the Red Feather set&#xD;
to work. "While eating he discoursed upon various topics in the hearing of the&#xD;
Wild Rose, touching here and there upon' Robert Campbell, appearing uninten-&#xD;
tional and indifferent regarding the impression, which his words would make&#xD;
upon his hearers. Yet he knew well.enough, that both' father and daughter were&#xD;
earnest attentive listeners, the former for political, the latter for personal rea-&#xD;
sons. It must be'confessed that the chief told well, like most of his race, who&#xD;
receive from nature, what many a white orator has to acquire by long, patient&#xD;
* years of study.&#xD;
After describing the Fort and the reception by the Commander, he entered&#xD;
upon that portion of his narrative relating to his stay in the family of the scout.&#xD;
This, of course,was more interesting to the Wild Rose than all the rest, as she&#xD;
knew of the intimate relation between Anderson and Campbell;- but she ab-&#xD;
stained from betraying her interests, thus showing the self control not only of&#xD;
the individual, but also of the race.&#xD;
Suddenly, however, her attention was destined to reach a painful intensity.&#xD;
The chief began to speak about a beautiful maiden, the daughter of his host.&#xD;
This maiden he purposly adorned with all the charms'imaginable, and then&#xD;
suddenly'-followed with the announcement of her intended marriage with Rob-&#xD;
ertCampbell.&#xD;
This time the Wild Rose could not suppress a slight start. True, she had&#xD;
often seen Indian marriages between one husband and half a dozen of wives;&#xD;
but she also knew that such was not the practice amongst white men, and even&#xD;
if it had been, her ardent nature would not have contented itself with a share&#xD;
of her husband's affection. No indeed, she, and she alone,.wanted to be the&#xD;
wife of Robert Caipbell, and woe to the maiden that would venture tocross&#xD;
her path! Certain destruction would be her fate!&#xD;
But no! she merely raved and troubled herself for nothing, for only 'a short&#xD;
hour ago had she received her betrothed's message, that he still loved her as&#xD;
fondly as ever, and that he would be sure to meet her at the rendezvous pro-&#xD;
posed. So this communication of the Red Feather must either be 'based upon&#xD;
a wilful falsehood or an innocent mistake. In either case it would be below&#xD;
her dignity to call him'to account cr correct his error. She allowed him to fin-&#xD;
ish his story and to depart without uttering a single word about this or other&#xD;
-          matters. Still she could not prevent a certain dejection from spreading over&#xD;
her countenance.&#xD;
The Beaver saw it. He had from the moment of disclosure sympathized&#xD;
with his favorite child.                          .&#xD;
"My daughter is sad," she said. ,"She :must not take this too much to,&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
The Wild Rose quietly raised'her head,&#xD;

"The Beaver does not believe, the Red Feather, his tongue is crooked and'&#xD;
his words are lies.'"&#xD;
" I have never found the chief given tolies."&#xD;
"Then he is mistaken. Surely Robert Campbell cannot bp false to the Wild&#xD;
Rose."&#xD;
"I hope not my daughter; but these pale-faces are at best a fickle race. If&#xD;
it be true, the Wild Rose must not wither and mourn her -loss."&#xD;
It it is true, the Wild Rose will sting and die; but it cannot be true; the&#xD;
chief cannot prove his words."&#xD;
" Shall the Beave'r go and try him?"&#xD;
"Yes, the Wild Rose will be thankful to her father, She would go herself,&#xD;
but she loathes to meet the Red Feather."&#xD;
- The Beaver rose and without further parley left the house. During his ab-&#xD;
sence the girl neither spoke nor, stirred, and when the chief returned after an&#xD;
hour's absence he found her in the sane place and position. His countenance&#xD;
looked troubled and he seemed to shrink from making his communication.&#xD;
Le my father speak," the maiden said with a steady voice. *' She knows,&#xD;
he has bad news; but she can:hear them."&#xD;
The Beaver proceeded to give her the details of the Red Feather~s-visit at&#xD;
Anderson's house, neither adding nor.omitting a single word' of the account he&#xD;
had received from the'chief. He also told her that the Red Feather had spoken&#xD;
of a trip which the family of the scout had agreed upon in his presence. They&#xD;
were to go to an 'island in the Ohio river, some'miles above the Beaver, to spend&#xD;
a clay there camping out. - Campbell, he said, was to go along.&#xD;
" And when do they propose making this excursion?"&#xD;
" To-morrow.".                                     -&#xD;
" It is wvell," the girl said with a determined voice; "the Wild, Rose will go&#xD;
and see; to-morrow night she will know the truth."&#xD;
The. Beaver remained silent. Perhaps he knew his daughter and'was aware&#xD;
that persuasions would be of no avail; perhaps he thought himself, that cer--&#xD;
tainty was preferable to a state of painful doubt, no matter how galling it might&#xD;
prove. The girl on the other hand went to see her brothers and bid them get&#xD;
ready for an early start the next morning. During the day she was taciturn,&#xD;
the Beaver humoring her like a spoilt child, but feeling the want of her sunny&#xD;
smile more keenly than he would confess to himself. When on the rising of the&#xD;
next sun his three 'children, after a short farewell, left him for their trip to the&#xD;
banks of the.Ohio, he looked after them with an expression more sad than his&#xD;
countenance had worn for many a day.&#xD;
The trio followed the right bank of the Beaver to the mouth of the Con-&#xD;
nequenessing. There they crossed over to the left bank, and pursuing a south-&#xD;
eastern course, after a few hours walking, passed the foot of the big knob, at&#xD;
the sight of which the shade on the face of the Wild Rose deepened. No won-&#xD;
der! how could the poor girl gaze at the place~of the appointed rendezvous with&#xD;
her lover without a keen sensation of pain at the thought of the peril threaten-&#xD;

striking the river at a point opposite the island of which they were in search.&#xD;
The reader knows these islands now as Hog and Crow.Islands, but he is mis-&#xD;
take? it he thinks that in those days they bore an aspect similar to- the present&#xD;
ones. They were larger and densely wooded, and their high banks projected&#xD;
so steeply into the water that their ascent was only practicable in a few places.&#xD;
The girl and her companions had no canoe and were unable to reach the is-&#xD;
lands; nor was this their purpose, but taking their position oh the heights, lin-&#xD;
ing the right bank of the river, so that they could spy any vessel coming u the&#xD;
river, they waited for the development of events with Indian patience.&#xD;
It was about nine o'clock now and a whole hour elapsed before the expected&#xD;
canoe came in sight. At.last, however, they perceived a vessel of that descrip-&#xD;
tion coming up stream with a rapidity speaking well for the skill and strength&#xD;
of the persons handling the paddle. They were still top far away to allow a&#xD;
recognition, but Wild Rose saw enough to know that one of the party belonged&#xD;
to the male and two to the female sex. Themale was of the size-and appear-&#xD;
ance of the young hunter whose image she treasured witl such fidelity in her&#xD;
heart, and she felt a strange thrill go through her body as the canoe came&#xD;
nearer-and nearer and the eye sustained the anticipation of her heart. It was&#xD;
indeed Robert Campbell; but the pleasure which Wild Rose felt at this long-&#xD;
missed sight was embittered by the presence of his companions, in one of whom&#xD;
her keen eye, even at that distance, discovered marks of uncommpn beauty.&#xD;
When the canoe was abreast the first island it- changed its course, heading&#xD;
diagonally for, and finally striking, the lower end of it, where it was fastened&#xD;
and a landing effected. The hunter first helped his companions to ascend the&#xD;
steep bank, and then emptied the canoe of various articles, which he had evi-&#xD;
dently brought along to increase the comforts of the expedition. Wild' Rose&#xD;
recognized several articles of apparel; also an iron kettle, probably intended for&#xD;
boiling tea or coffee. When everything was\an shore the party disappeared in&#xD;
the bushes, thus forcing Wild Rose to draw upon her imagination for any con-&#xD;
jectures of their doings. Alas! if her eyes had before done her bad service, her&#xD;
fancy now served her infinitely worse. She imagined her lover engaged in of-&#xD;
fering to another the homage so eminently due to her. She fancied him smil-&#xD;
.ing upon his lovely, companion, and whispering soft words of love and admira-&#xD;
tion. Ah! the agonizing tortures that filled those morning hours, as they slow-&#xD;
ly passed, away. . Wild Rose never. moved; anal her brothers, guessing the&#xD;
nature of her feelings, preserved a sympathetic silence. At last, when the sun&#xD;
was nearing the meridian, the scene once more assumed a lively aspect. A&#xD;
thin column of smoke slowly stole through the bushes and trees of the island,&#xD;
and figures could be seen gliding here and there in the pursuance of sundry oc-&#xD;
cupations. All at once the younger woman came close to the waters edge,&#xD;

opposite the place from which Wild Rose watched her movements. She seem-&#xD;
ed to be gathering flowers for a bouquet. Wild Rose gazed at her with a pain-&#xD;
ful interest. She noticed the coming of.a danger, of which'the stranger herself&#xD;
was ignorant. The bank of the island was not only steep,'but the swift current&#xD;
had, with a greedy tongue, licked all the soil from underneath, until nothing&#xD;
but a network of roots kept the surface from caving in.. This hollow ground&#xD;
was many feet in width, thus excluding from the mind of the girl on the surface&#xD;
all thoughts of danger, provided she kept reasonably distant from its edge. So&#xD;
she stepped out farther and farther, and, at last, in trying to pluck a cluster of&#xD;
roses blooming near the edge, leaned forward with the whole weight of her&#xD;
body. At this moment the suspense of the Indian girl reached its climax. Two&#xD;
principles, wargPing in her bosom, struggled for the mastery. While the demon&#xD;
of jealousy breathed into her mind the desire to see the bank sink with its pre-&#xD;
cious burden into the treacherous flood, never to return, a better spirit.whisper-&#xD;
ed into he- ears the Oummons to challenge the girl, and warn her of danger.&#xD;
At last the better spirit prevailed. Wild Rose stepped from her cover and lift-&#xD;
ing her hand, uttered a warning cry, but it was too late. Her own voice was&#xD;
drowned by a more piercing shriek from the island, which the girl on the bank&#xD;
uttered on perceiving the bank give way. The poor maiden was the helpless&#xD;
spectator of her coming doom; for the piece detaching itself from the bank was&#xD;
so large that its fall consumed some time, landing her a considerable distance&#xD;
into the flood. Her shriek had caused the scout to start at once for the place&#xD;
from which it emanated,-in order to ascertain its cause. lie was by no means&#xD;
prepared for the full truth, and we can easily imagine his consternation when,&#xD;
on reaching the bank, he saw his companion disappearing in the water. With-&#xD;
out hesitation he took a powerful leap, reaching near the place where the girl&#xD;
had sunk, and as he struggled powerfully to reach the surface, he emerged from&#xD;
the water at the same time with Rosa-Anderson, and so near that she was al-&#xD;
most within reach of his hand.&#xD;
Hold up, Rose, for God's sake! hold up one moment!" he cried to her in&#xD;
an encouraging tone, and striking out vigorously towards her caught her arm&#xD;
as she was sinking the second tire. Drawing her up with all hisstrength he&#xD;
succeeded in raising her head above water, enabling her to breathe and pre-&#xD;
serve a shadow of consciousness. Having so far succeeded in his work of res-&#xD;
cue the hunter looked around for the best method of completing. it. The cur-&#xD;
rent was fast taking them towards the end of the- island, and once past that&#xD;
point the position of. Rosa would again have become very- perilous, as Robert&#xD;
could not have reached the main shore without a powerful struggle and great&#xD;
loss of time. So he commenced to strike out for the island with an exertion&#xD;
proportionate to the interests at stake. For a while it was 'uncertain whether&#xD;
he would succeed, as the burden of the half-conscious girl impeded his progress:&#xD;
lior would he, in spite of his most desperate efforts, have reached the point if&#xD;
Grace Jones hadnot, with great presence of mind, sprung to his assistance.&#xD;
She had witnessed his leap into the water, and divini-ng its purpose, ran to the'&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
A CRISIS.&#xD;
The LIieutenant had led a miserable existence ever since his discovery of the&#xD;
imagined unfaithfulness of Rosa Anderson. He had shunned RobertCampbell&#xD;
as well as his mistress, greatly to the wonderment of the latter person. She had&#xD;
in various ways endeavored to intercept him, being exceedingly anxious for an&#xD;
explanation of his curious conduct; but he had avoided her so doggedly that at&#xD;
last her anxiety gave place to indignation, and induced her to change her tac-&#xD;

-point to, ascertain the result of his efforts., She was filled with consternation,&#xD;
but her frontier experience had too fully developed her mental and physical fac-&#xD;
ulties to paralyze them beyond the power of control. When she saw the hunt-&#xD;
er struggling to reach the point, she prepared to assist him to the best of her&#xD;
ability, Securing a long sapling she held it out to the swimmer, firmly grasp-&#xD;
ing another with her unengaged hand. Robert eagerly benefited by this unex-&#xD;
pected aid. He seized the sapling and suffered himself to swing around until he&#xD;
was out of the strong current and had reached the eddy below the point. Once&#xD;
there he found no difficulty in reaching the shore, for telling Grace to keep a&#xD;
tight hold dn the stick, he gradual  pulled himself nearer the bank, until his&#xD;
feet touched bottom. Then carrying the senseless body of the girl quickly up&#xD;
the bank, gently deposited her on the grass. Then botlh he and Grace began&#xD;
their efforts at resuscitation, which were soon crowned with success, as the girl&#xD;
had not been very long under water. When she opened her eyes Grace broke&#xD;
out into a loud shout of delight. Nor could the hunted abstain from lively ex-&#xD;
pressigns of satisfaction, without having the slightest knowledge of the pain&#xD;
that every movement of his sent to a 16ving heart. Wild Rose had been a si-&#xD;
lent anh1 immovable, but by no means indifferent witness of the exciting drama&#xD;
enacted before')her eyes. She had struggled and conquered with the hunter,&#xD;
exulting in the manly strength of one so dear to her, and only when the faint&#xD;
body-of the rescued girl began to showsigns of returning life, the whole con-&#xD;
sciousness of her own wretched condition returned to her memory. She con-&#xD;
tinued towatch the movements of they party on the island; she saw them em-&#xD;
Vark, and looked after their receding forms until their last vestige had vanished&#xD;
from sight. Then heaving one heavy sigh she turned to her brothers and said:&#xD;
"You have seen that maiden; 'would you recognize her again?"&#xD;
"We would."&#xD;
" Very well! within one week she must be a prisoner in'my hands!"&#xD;

tics. If her studied endeavors to meet him remained fruitlessprhaps the oppo-&#xD;
site extreme would be attended with better results. So assuming. a gay and&#xD;
unconcerned mein, to which her heart decidedly gave the lie; she feigned to&#xD;
find unusual pleasure in the company of Robert Campbell, She talked to him&#xD;
whenever she had a chance, and finally let her policy of defiance culminate in&#xD;
the excursion which we have depicted in the preceding chapter. The exposure&#xD;
to a watery grave was by no means the worst feature of this excursion. It had&#xD;
- kindled sensations so fierce in two different minds,.that the artless girl would&#xD;
have trembled at the knowledge. That Wild Rose had 'in consequence pf it&#xD;
been confirmed in her unfortunate opinion, the reader knows: that the case of&#xD;
the Lieutenant had not been improved thereby he can imagine. Indeed noth,.&#xD;
ing more injurious for the interests of both parties could well be conceived than&#xD;
this'pretended indifference and flirtation on the part of Rosa Anderson. What&#xD;
she designed for a cure merely aggravated the evil--a case not uncommon&#xD;
where the diagnosis is npt well understood. Rosa had not the slightest idea&#xD;
of the gloomy doubts regarding her constancy that fevered the brain of her&#xD;
once light-hearted lover, or she would have been slow to adopt a tethod cal-&#xD;
culated tQ complete his delirium-r delirious he was. Neglecting his associ-&#xD;
ates and, in a measure, his duties; begrudging his associates the few words he&#xD;
was obliged to speak, he wandered about the Fort a mere shadow of the. gay&#xD;
fellow he had been, The Captain noticed the change, but attributing 't to a&#xD;
passing indisposition indulged the supposed patient. Had he known the dark&#xD;
projects of revenge over which the. young man constantly 'brooded he might&#xD;
have acted differently.&#xD;
Yes, revenge! that was the only thought in which he endeavored to drown'&#xD;
disappointed love. Revenge on him and her! He might have immediately&#xD;
by insulting language, provoked a-deadly quarrrel, if the knowledge of the near&#xD;
rendezvous on the big knob had not restrained him. He resolved to wait and&#xD;
like their evil genius step between'them th'ere, to fling his utmost contempt into&#xD;
her face, and then drive a knife into his boson; to fare afterwards, he cared not&#xD;
how. His revenge once satisfied, the rest was totally indifferent to him,&#xD;
V            Time-generally so rapid in theestimation of the many-crept with unbear-&#xD;
able slowness to him. At last, however, the morning of the rendezvous dawn-&#xD;
ed, and after providing for a more than liberal quantity of ardent drink, he early&#xD;
sought the woods, taking the direction of the big knob, and walking all overits&#xD;
summit hours before the appointed time. Every now and then his restlessness&#xD;
would drive him away to wander in the woods, until at length the fatal spot at-&#xD;
traCted him anew, merely to repel a second time.&#xD;
There was a second party to whom the big knob proved equally attractive--&#xD;
Wild Rose. She had completely renounced the sweet expectation which she&#xD;
had at first entertained of the meeting. In coming now she had a very differ,&#xD;
ent object in view-that of humiliatingand punishing her faithless lover. She&#xD;
would frown him down-but no, we would violate the truth by saying what  -&#xD;
,she would do, Her heart was a chaos of conflicting feelings, the only sensa,&#xD;
&#xD;
'1 it;W 1)KSoonr 'n11MLA V Li.        :   79&#xD;
tion of which she was fully conscious was a deep agony, bordering on dispair,&#xD;
Wild Rose ,was surprised at the presence of the Lieutenant; her surprise&#xD;
growing as she noticed his strange conduct, His frantic movement partly neu-&#xD;
tralized her excitement; but as noon approached, she became restless at the&#xD;
perseverance with which he adhered to the spot. What if he should take its in&#xD;
his head to stay! She would not tolerate the presence, of a witness at the com-&#xD;
ing interview, yet she sawno way of removing him. She saw no other way&#xD;
but to resign herself to fate and abide the issue; but the Irritation caused by the&#xD;
prolonged stay of this stubborn individual had the tendency to soften her toi&#xD;
wards her lover, acting, as it were, in the capacity of a conductor,&#xD;
Many impatient glances did the poor girl cast at the heavens, and when the&#xD;
position of the sun indicated the hour of noon a nervousness agitated a body&#xD;
generally so firm. She knew the hunter was coming, for the frontiersmen imi-&#xD;
tated their Indian neighbors, in the punctuality pith which they observed their&#xD;
engagements. Robert would have hastened to the spot much earlier had he&#xD;
not thought his Indian bridg would prize a, manifestation of punctual firmness&#xD;
even more than impatient love. He had purposely restrained his impatience in&#xD;
order to appear at the rendezvous exactly at-the appointed lo6ur,' In this he&#xD;
succeeded, but imagine his surprise at discovering the Lieutenant instead of an&#xD;
other, towards whom he was'drawn with all the ardor of a pent-up passion.&#xD;
The appearance of the officer made him start, Robert had noticed his sullen&#xD;
looks bef re; but the anticipation of the happy in-terview in store for lim had&#xD;
made him more indifferent than usual to this and other things not directly con-&#xD;
nected with his love. Now, however, the singular appearance of the officer&#xD;
struck him with double force and for the moment he forgot his disappointments&#xD;
"Why, Lieutenant," he'exclaimed, walking towards him with a concerned&#xD;
air, " what in the world ails you? You look very ill."&#xD;
"And you, I suppose, would like to play the doctor?" the officer inquired with&#xD;
a sneer. Well I do not object to the drawing of a little bod, I'll pay you on&#xD;
the spot,too; for having so many little bills to settle with you a little more or less&#xD;
does not matter."&#xD;
Bills to settle! Lieutenant, truly you are, delirious and ought to be in bed."&#xD;
"rYes, yes, I'll lay myself doivn to a long deep slumber before long; but first&#xD;
I tmust settle my accounts with you. But say, where is that hussy of yours?&#xD;
{ Is she going to break faith with you as she did with me?"&#xD;
" -Iussy, Lieutenant! what on earth do you mean?"&#xD;
"Howinnocent!" the other sneered.. " One would imagine you had always&#xD;
lived on mother's milk, I want to know where the heartless flirt is that stole&#xD;
my heart and after breaking it, threw it away like a worthless pebble;"&#xD;
The hunter was too much astonished to get angry or even answer. He look-&#xD;
ed 'at the officer in blank surprise.&#xD;
"Of course you will deny," the Lieutenant resumed.. ,"Sneak and liar tis t&#xD;
you are, what could you do with more propriety than continue to do the same?"&#xD;
The hunter started. If the officer had spoken those words in what the oth -c&#xD;

80               THE WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVER.&#xD;
considered a responsible state of mind he would  have resented them in a way&#xD;
that it would have been doubtful if the 'Lieutenant had lived to repeat them.&#xD;
The hunter, however, considered him delirious or mad-an opinion not falling&#xD;
far from truth-and therefore resolved to ignore the taunt.&#xD;
"Lieutenant," he said gently, "allow me to lead you hence to the Fort; for it&#xD;
is evident that you need care and attention in the worst kind of a way. It does&#xD;
not suit me either to leave this place just now, but still-"&#xD;
Ah he does not like to leave this place!" the.other interrupted with a bitter&#xD;
laugh. "No; I suppose you do not, Your paramour would cut a queer figure&#xD;
in coming here, and you away."&#xD;
"Again that word! Lieutenant you show method in your madness.. You must&#xD;
in some way have got a glimpse of the nature of my errand here, else-'&#xD;
There it comes!" the Lieutenant cried. " I knew he could not hide it in&#xD;
his vile carcass!"&#xD;
The brow of the hunter darkened. He made a rapid step towards the other,&#xD;
saying:- "Enough of that now, sir! Mad or no mad, I want no more of your&#xD;
impudence!"&#xD;
"Ah finally!" the Lieutenant exclaimed; "he's warming up. I had almost&#xD;
given up the hope of seeing his sluggish blood boil up."&#xD;
"Yes,.I see now what your intention is," Robert replied coolly, having 'by&#xD;
this time fully recovered his self-possession. " But I am sorry to disappoint&#xD;
you. It shall not be said that I allowed a madman to make me angry."&#xD;
"It shall not-shall it?" the Lieutenant cried, fairly boiling with rage. "Well&#xD;
then, so they shall say at last, that a madman was more than a match for you."&#xD;
Drawing his knife he threw himself with such rapidity upon the hunter that&#xD;
any onesless used to the frontier and its warfare might have been taken una-&#xD;
Swares and fallen a victim tothe sudden onset. Not so the hunter. He had&#xD;
learned tb deal with the.wily savage, and the thrust of the Lieutenant, there-&#xD;
fore, did not take him by surprise. Springing aside and striking the lifted arm&#xD;
of the officer he made him spin around before recovering his equilibrium* This&#xD;
disappointment, however', made the infuriated man only-more eager for another&#xD;
onset, but just at the moment when he meant to make the spring a strange&#xD;
hand was laid upon his arm, causing him to stop, more in consequence of the&#xD;
unexpected interference, than by the force of the movement. Stopping in obe-&#xD;
dience to the check, and turning around his eye caught a sight well calculated&#xD;
to upset the little judgment left him. Before him stood in her majestic beauty&#xD;
the maiden whom the -reader has long ago learned to know as Wild Rose. To&#xD;
the Lieutenant it had almost the force of a heavenly apparition, so suddenly and&#xD;
unexpectedly did it break upon him.&#xD;
Who are you? What do you want of me?" he asked in startled surprise.&#xD;
"It's all the same who me be. Me want to keep you from being kill."&#xD;
Are you so sure of that?" the officer inquired, regaining his spirit of defiance&#xD;
in the same proportion as his bewilderment subsided.      4&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, me is. If your eyes are not blind with fury-you see yourself. You&#xD;
not think you kill bunter?"&#xD;
The last question was asked in a mixture of derision and exultation. Injured&#xD;
as he thought herself, she could not forget the skill and prowess of her lover.&#xD;
" Yes I do think that, and if you stand aside,'I shall prove it. What busi-&#xD;
ness have you at any rate to interfere in this affair?"&#xD;
"More business than you. Why come here, when not called? Me sent for&#xD;
the hunter, not for you."&#xD;
The officer started. " You sent for him? you?"&#xD;
Yes me-why wonder?"&#xD;
"You sent an Indian boy, did you not?"&#xD;
There was so much painful suspense in his tone, that Wild Rose was touched.&#xD;
So humoring him she replied: "Yes me did, ask any more questions now?"&#xD;
But thg Lieutenant was satisfied. . A light began to dawn in his benighted&#xD;
mind and he conimenced to have serious doubts about the justice of his jeal-&#xD;
ous suspicions. So much did the strong emotions of his heart overpower him&#xD;
that he could neither stir or speak, standing for a while the helpless prey of his&#xD;
excitement.&#xD;
This pause was at cnce improved by the hunter. His first joyous start at the&#xD;
sight of his betrothed had yielded to the admiration of her splendid bearing in&#xD;
her encounter with, his foe.  He stepped, as it were, out of himself, loosin-&#xD;
sight of the lover over the enthusiastic spectator; but when the voices of thR&#xD;
speakers died away he returned to reality and himself.  Never before had he&#xD;
been so fully conscious of the deep love, with which this wondef-ful creature had&#xD;
inspired him and extending both his arms towards the maiden, who all the&#xD;
while had kept her back to him, he cried with the thrilling-accents of a power-&#xD;
ful passion: "Wild Rose! my dear, my noble bride!"&#xD;
The body of the girl quivered with excitement, but her face remaizfined averted&#xD;
from the hunter as before. Now for the first time, it struck him, that this per-&#xD;
sistent effort on her part, to ignore his presence was something more than caus-&#xD;
ual. A fear of some.impending evil, the thought of the possibility of losing this&#xD;
lovely.mdiden oppressed his heart with so much force as almost to deprive hin&#xD;
ophis breath. A pain shook his system and finally found vent in an exclama-&#xD;
tion fraught with all the conflicting emotions struggling in his bosom. "Rose!"&#xD;
This time the girl was incapable of resisting the conjuration. She turned he'&#xD;
(head, asif driven by an irresisttable power;,btt the glance she cast at him, was&#xD;
evidently intended as one of crushing severity. Still all powerful love .lurked&#xD;
behind her indignation, as the sun behind the parting clouds of the thunder-&#xD;
storm. It also manifested itself in her voice Jor though her words were word.,&#xD;
of accusation, their acrimony was tempered by softer feelings.&#xD;
," What you call me for? Why you say.with tongue, what heart not know&#xD;
You- call me '4dear'-go to the maiden in the Fort-she dear yhe listen t&#xD;
your words--the ear of Wild Rose is deaf-it cannotlisten; her ;  rt is closed.&#xD;
.Robert's grief was almost aralyzed by his bewilderment. " Rose wvhat doe.&#xD;

THE WIt. ROSE Of 'TtIE  EAVER,&#xD;
this signify?' he cried with looks and accents of injured innocence. " Has the&#xD;
world gone mad and resolved to upset my reason too? Sp~ak, what do your&#xD;
strnge uphraidings mean,?"&#xD;
"You not know? You not know maiden at Fort?" Wild Rose asked eagerly.&#xD;
"If you;mean Rosa Anderson, certainly I do. Is there an harm in knowing&#xD;
the daughter of my oldert and best friend?"&#xD;
" You not only know-you love her!"&#xD;
"Again this strange insinuation. There must be a cotspi'acy to fasten this&#xD;
upon me; else how should you repeat the accusations of this ciazy officer?"&#xD;
" I accuse you no longer Robert, and humbly beg pardon formy foolishness?"&#xD;
The others 'were too much engaged with themselves to heed this exclamation.&#xD;
",If you iot love her why go out in canoe? Rose eagerly asked the hunter,&#xD;
" Rose, how can you speak so?" Robert laid reproachfully. 'Is a ride on&#xD;
the river an evidence of love?"&#xD;
"When not love, why jump in river and risk your life?"&#xD;
"\Well, this is really strange! My Wild Rose is evidently jealous and that&#xD;
passion neutralizes all' her virtues. Rose,.you want to know why I jumped into&#xD;
the river to save one of your sex-a woman?"&#xD;
Wild Rose looked abashed for a, moment, but recovering rapidly under the&#xD;
impulse of a new thought, said almost sternly: " I fear Big Jump has a forked&#xD;
tongue. He talks sweetly to the ear, but his words cannot enter the heart of&#xD;
Vild Rose. Did not the father of the maiden say the hunter would soon lead&#xD;
his daughter into his wigwam?"&#xD;
I will'not deny but that he has often intimated such a wish, though it sur-&#xD;
passes my comprehension how you ever heard of it, Tell me, Rose, what tale&#xD;
bearer has thus prejudiced you against me?"&#xD;
As the girl hesitated the hunter continued in mournful accents: " Rose you&#xD;
have the heart to fling these accusations in my face, and yet refuse to let me&#xD;
know from whence'they spring. Do youcondernwithout a chance of defence?"&#xD;
"What good will it do to know? You canot deny. Red Feather no lie!"&#xD;
"Red Feather!" Robert exclaimed in astonishment., ' Ah!.now I know.&#xD;
While I kindly took that serpent to my bosom he endeavored to inflict a deadly&#xD;
wound. But the day of reckoning will come. I owed him a grudge before but&#xD;
like a good natured fool cancelled the account. This time, however, he 'won't&#xD;
fare so well; for I vow to satisfy this injury with his blood!"&#xD;
This was a savage. threat and would have alarmed a girl of gentler educa&#xD;
tion. With Wild Rose the case was different. The words of the hunter were&#xD;
in accordance with her notions, and her jealous indignation was gradually over&#xD;
- come by the rising waves of love and admiration.~ She looked at the hunter&#xD;
with a look of old; but in his excitement he failed to notice it.&#xD;
" The chief did lie, Rose, but if you really believe his statement in preference&#xD;
to mine I cgyprove my words. This officer is, or lately was, the lover of Rose&#xD;
Anderson 1i44l he began to labor under the delusion that I had meddled with&#xD;
his love. Ile can testify to this, if jealousy has not obscured his mind."&#xD;

The Liedtenant winced -under these cutting remarks, but without anger.&#xD;
I have acted like a madmin,the said, "and therefore 'cannot complain- for&#xD;
being so considered. But I have discovered my mistake  The Indian lalwho&#xD;
betrayed this, rendezvous, in speaking of a Rose teant not "Rose An person."&#xD;
The eyes of Wild Rose flashed fire. She stepped up to the office and said&#xD;
angrily; " Who told? What Indian lad do you mean ?"&#xD;
"I, mean a youth going by the name of Red Fox:"&#xD;
The girl uttered a cry of indignation.&#xD;
"You must not blame him, ' the Lieutenant'replied, "for he never mneant to&#xD;
betray his trust. "It was fire-water'that' drew it frdm him."&#xD;
" And so youi having beenaware of'this-'rendezvous all the time, I''now un-&#xD;
derstand your change of conduct. But w hy did you not seak? Ydu caine very&#xD;
near causing great distfrss by your mad jealousy."&#xD;
" I know I am to blame; but if you knew what I suffered in these days of sus-&#xD;
pense, you would deem 'me amply puiiished-for my want of confidence."&#xD;
"Your face shows it, poor fellow. Well, Rose,'ddy ou want more testimony?&#xD;
Shall'I"lead you to the Fort, that you may learn from the lips of both father&#xD;
and daughter, how much you have wronged me by this cruel suspicion?"&#xD;
Wild Rose was conquered. Stepping n eekly up to the hunter and taking&#xD;
one of his hands in both of hers, she said with her face averted: " Wild Rose&#xD;
has been wrong; she has bitterly wronged her'husband."&#xD;
" So, that will do?' the young man cried with a joyous voice. "No more&#xD;
self-accusations, darling. Come to my heart,,for that is where you belong,"&#xD;
He tried to draw her into his embrace, but; she-resisted, keeping her face&#xD;
averted all the while. " My husband does not know all," she said, gently shak-&#xD;
Ing her head. " When he knows aIl, he'll turn from Wild Rose and leAve her."&#xD;
"Rose, what can you mean? Do not torture you self xxwith idle fears! What&#xD;
could you have done to alienate me from you?"&#xD;
"The heartof Wild Rose was angry; jealousy blinded her. She 'told hier&#xD;
brothers to watch for the girl and snatch her away-they ire now on.her trail."&#xD;
Did you really do that; Roe:'  And' vhat would you do vi'th the prisoner?"&#xD;
"I hardly know. I w nted to strike'the heart ofimy husband. I'wanted to&#xD;
make him feel vhat it is be deprived of o1ieV sunshine, of all the prospects of&#xD;
happiness for a long wre bed life."&#xD;
These words had been uttered"in the Delaware tongue, as most all the words&#xD;
which Wild Rose had spoken in passion of excitement. At such time we use&#xD;
,our mother tongcne, and I have tried to imitate such jgssages by rendering them&#xD;
in their full flow, thus distinguishing'them from thd utterances maide in broken&#xD;
English.     9:&#xD;
When' Robert after this confession gain endeavored to dwaxx Wild Rose to&#xD;
1his heart she nolonger resisted.&#xD;
"''hus," the hunter exclaimed, thegreat happiness ofhis heai refle:ted on his&#xD;
face. "Our peace is made my dear beautiful wife. Henceforth Ishall not al:&#xD;
low you to leave  for I do not want new differercqs to come between us."&#xD;

Wild Rose shook her head and said: " Myhusband must let me go fora few&#xD;
(lays more. Wild Rose must take her brothers from,\the maiden's trail and bid&#xD;
her father farewell. Her husband need not fear; she will not doubt again."&#xD;
" So you want to run off again, you little vagabond? Lieutenant, do-you.&#xD;
think it safe to let her go?"&#xD;
"Indeed it would! She is a wonderful woman, and if I had not my affection&#xD;
already fixed I would feel inclined to turn the tables, and become your rival."&#xD;
Exactly my fix," the hunter said laughing. " If I had not already loved&#xD;
Rose Number One, I should have fallen in love with Number Two. See how&#xD;
our Roses resemble each other, as if grown on the same stalk! Do they not?"&#xD;
"Rather as one grafted on the stalk of the other. They are both beautiful&#xD;
and loveable, and there is no cause for jealousy between us."&#xD;
"Spoken from the bottom of my heart. Here is my hand, Lieutenant, and&#xD;
the offer of a firm friendship. There has been a cloud between us from the&#xD;
start; but now it is removed, and I do not see why we should not be friends,"&#xD;
" Nor I, Campbell. I always acknowledged your great merits, and now I&#xD;
shall love you as sincerely as I admired."&#xD;
"And'so will I. This is truly a gratifying conclusion to a perplexing diffi-&#xD;
culty. Instead of losing my little wife, as I thought I should, I gain a friend.'&#xD;
But Rose is getting restless. What is the matter child?",&#xD;
Wild Rose must go. Her brothers'might harm the maiden."&#xD;
"That sounds plausible. And wh n shall I call the Wild Rose my own?"&#xD;
The maiden mused, and with a slight blush on her cheeks said:&#xD;
"In one week from to-day Wild Rose will follow her husband to his wigwam:"&#xD;
Agreed! "Robert exclaimed. " Let me seal this compromise with a .kiss.&#xD;
And now seeing that my little bird is eager to fly off, let us come to -an under-&#xD;
standing. You, Lieutenant, of course are eager to reach the Fort, to make&#xD;
peace with your pouting mistress. I can assure you she played the flirt all&#xD;
these days with a bad grace, and when I got her out of the water the first word&#xD;
after her return to consciousness was your name. So I suppose she is anxious&#xD;
enough to see you, though her face may possibly belie her feelings."&#xD;
"Oh! thank you for this comforting assurance, Robert. But I suppose I&#xD;
shall have to make my way alone; for you will want to see this friend of yours&#xD;
at least a part of the way home?"&#xD;
You are not mistaken, sir," the hunter said with a smile. " She is a wild i&#xD;
bird you know and if I do not watch her some, her natural instinct may take"&#xD;
her off to regions unknown."&#xD;
After this they parted, the Lieutenant hastening with all speed towards the&#xD;
Fort, but the hunter and his companion wandering-in another direction towards-&#xD;
the place where the Delaware town was situated.&#xD;
They had tottell each other so much and were so completely wraped up in&#xD;
their new b6rna happiness, that for once the watchfulness of their sense left&#xD;
them. The hunter, who generally keeps his keen eye wandering all aronnd&#xD;
reading the signs of the woods as the well trained scholar does his A. B. C., in&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WILD ROSE OF TIE BEAVER,               8S&#xD;
this instance had no thought but her who now walked at his side, and had in-&#xD;
dicated her willingness to soon light up his home with her beauty and loveliness.&#xD;
We need, therefore, not wonder that after their departure the figure of an&#xD;
Indian rose from the dense bushes of the Big Knob, revealing the dark features&#xD;
of no less a person'than Red Feather. The chief had ,stealthily followed the&#xD;
trail of Wild Rose, and thus become the witness of a reconciliation, which to-&#xD;
tally blasted his new born hopes. His countenance therefore bore a sinister ex-&#xD;
pression, and when he prepared to leave the place where he had endured a&#xD;
long mental torture, he'balled his fists and shook it after the departing couple&#xD;
with a mein portending little good. Woe to them if his power of harmirigis&#xD;
equal to his desire of doing so.&#xD;
Instant pursuit, however, did not seem to lie in the plans of the chief. In-&#xD;
stead of following on the track of the couple, he took a more north-eastern di-&#xD;
rection, calculated to bring him to the Connequenessing about ten 'miles above&#xD;
its junction with the Beaver. He did not ain'at speed, and thereforereached&#xD;
the creek about the hour of twilight. He wandered up and down the bank as&#xD;
if he were in search of something, until at last a look of satisfaction seemed to&#xD;
indicate that his intention' had not been in vain. Stepping to the water's edge,&#xD;
he pushed some bushes aside, but starting back he uttered a cry of surprise,&#xD;
which showed that something very unexpected must have met his eye. This&#xD;
something at once-rose from the bush in- the shape of another Indian, who as-&#xD;
cended the bank, until he stood opposite-the chief.&#xD;
"Ugh!" Red Feather exclaimed, " what does a Seneca chief do in Maghpi-&#xD;
way's canoe?&#xD;
"Eaglehead waited for his brother, the chief; he knew Red Feather was&#xD;
coming."&#xD;
".Eaglehead must be very wise then; for he knew something, of which Red&#xD;
Feather himsealf was ignorant dntil this afternoon.' What does Eaglehead&#xD;
wish of his brother?"&#xD;
He would borrow his canoe from him to go up the Neshannock."&#xD;
Is he alone?"&#xD;
" No, there is a party of warriors with him, which will be here presently."&#xD;
"But why do they not walk to the Neshannock! The water course is wind-&#xD;
ing and tedious. Surely Eaglehead and his companions are strong enough to go."&#xD;
"But he wishes to leave no trail behind."&#xD;
"Ugh! Is he not going to be at the conference?"&#xD;
"No! Eaglehead will never make peace with the white man; he'll strike&#xD;
him unto the day of his death!"&#xD;
"Ugh! my brother speaks Maghpiway's heart; but my hands are tied at&#xD;
present. The Beaver is going to make peace, and I must feign submission to&#xD;
his wishes, if I do not want to lose my influence with the tribe."&#xD;
"Why does the chief tell this to his brother?"&#xD;
"To show ,him, that he sympathizes with him. But-listen, your men are&#xD;
coming."&#xD;

THE WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVER.&#xD;
&#xD;
This did not all seem to suit the Seneca 'chief, and he scowled at the Dela-&#xD;
ware in a very ugly manner. For a moment he appeared to entertain intentions&#xD;
of a decided hostile character, for his hand began to play n rvously about the&#xD;
handle-of his scalping knife; but suddenly he seemed to ch nge his notion, for&#xD;
the suspicious movements ceased, and with a bland an  courteous smile he&#xD;
said:  "Maghpiway is right. He'll soon see my youn men coming.  He'll&#xD;
also see a prisoner; butEaglehead would thank him t shut his eyes. It might&#xD;
hurt the chief to look too sharply."&#xD;
Maghpiway nodded. " I understand my brother: he need not be afraid.&#xD;
Maghpiway is accustomed to mind his own business. Is it a pale-face?"&#xD;
Instead of an answer Eaglehead pointed in the direction of the forest, through&#xD;
which several dusky forms were approaching. They were six in all, leading&#xD;
in their midst a white woman, who seemed to be much fatigued and in very&#xD;
low spirits, for two of the men more dragged than led her. When'they were&#xD;
near enough to allow a recognition of her features, Red Feather gage an invol.&#xD;
untary start and he might have indulged in In exclamation, if Eagiehead had&#xD;
not previously warned him. This was Delaware territory, to be sure, but Mag-&#xD;
hipway being alone deemed it better not to put his finger into a piety tat was not&#xD;
of his baking. So he not only remained silent, but also turned his t ce from the&#xD;
prisoner, leaving it uncertain whether he wanted to' avoid seeing or being scen.&#xD;
Looking significantly at Eaglehead, he said in an under tone:&#xD;
"Maghpiway now understands his Brother. He does indeed wel to destroy&#xD;
his trail; for if it is found the pale-faces will never stop until they find its end."&#xD;
"Red Feather will not lend ,them his eyes?"&#xD;
"Of course he will not; for Eaglehead could shut them forever. -Still, he&#xD;
would ask the Seneca chief a favor." " If he will lend him his warriors for a&#xD;
little while he will show-himself very grateful."&#xD;
"Where are the warriors of Red Feather? They are not dead?1'&#xD;
"No, but I cannot use them for the work in store. Maghpiway vants to do&#xD;
like his brother: he wants to take a prisoner. After he has talent him, he&#xD;
wants to send him to his brother, Eaglehead."&#xD;
"Ugh! Eaglehead has enough with one.prisoner-he does not vant to but-&#xD;
den himself with a second one."&#xD;
"My brother shall not keep him long.:- Maghpiway will come soon to re-&#xD;
lieve him. When he comes, it will not be with empty handh"&#xD;
The Seneca left this tempting remark unanswered.&#xD;
Maghpiway has some fine red bla'nkets he'll share .them with Ihis brother,&#xD;
Eaglehead."&#xD;
Eaglehead has many blankets."&#xD;
"Maghpiway will give him a gocd rifle."&#xD;
"Our brethren, the English, give us all the rifles we want."&#xD;
Has my-brother plenty of powder!"&#xD;
His horn is never empty."&#xD;
Well, let me tell him something: Maghpiway knows a lead m'ne."&#xD;

THE WILD P0St~ OF THE BEAVER                 87&#xD;
This conmtuication had conquered the Seneea's stoicism. A whole mine of&#xD;
lead! The thought was too powerful to be borne unmoved. - Maghpiwayre-&#xD;
sumed: "If Eaglehead helps his brother, Maghpiway will tell him the place."&#xD;
Eaglehead mused a moment. "What will Maghpiway do with the prisoner?&#xD;
Will he let him'escape to tell a tale?"&#xD;
An expression of intense hatred passed over the face of the chief.  Bending&#xD;
his head to the other's ear, he said: " He will bprn him at the stake; black&#xD;
bones tell no tale,"&#xD;
"'Then Eaglehead" will do it, When is Red Feather going to show him the&#xD;
lead?"                                           r&#xD;
"When the prisoner sings his death song."&#xD;
"It is well; how many warriors does my brother want?"&#xD;
"Can Eagleijead spate four?"&#xD;
"He can. How soon can they be with him again?"&#xD;
" In a few days at least; where does Eaglehead intend to go?"&#xD;
Does the'chief know the cave on the Neshannock?"&#xD;
"tHe does."&#xD;
"Very well-there Eaglehead will await his coming.'&#xD;
During this interval the warriors had halted with the prisoner at a respectful&#xD;
distance from the chiefs. Eaglehead now stepped up to them and spoke a few&#xD;
words, after which two ot them stepped into the canoe with the girl, the rest&#xD;
joining Red Feather,  When the Seeca chief prepared to follow the smaller&#xD;
party into the vessel, Maghpiway sal ted him, saying; "May my brother lave&#xD;
a safe journey. I shall try to blind t e eyes of the pale-faces."&#xD;
With this the canoe started down  stream, the chief taking gdool care to de-&#xD;
stroy all traces of the embarkation,  was not very likely that he would suc-&#xD;
ceed in misleading 'askillful pursuer y this alone; but in'addition to other&#xD;
fneasures it might, considerably puzzle him. To accomplish this he now set&#xD;
about causing the ;four warriors to star in four differeht directions into the for-&#xD;
'est, and striking 'himself a fifth one, th s managing to-create a profusion of&#xD;
tracks, which must necessarily perplex  e party or parties, who, as he knew,&#xD;
would soon be in pursuit. He instructed he warriors to continue their course&#xD;
to the next run; and to turn off and all con e back on the trail, which they had&#xD;
made on their first passage through the woods. This they did, reaching the&#xD;
place of starting at a moment when the veil of darkness began' to spread more&#xD;
thickly over the region, hiding them as well'asths woods, in which, under the&#xD;
directions of the chief, they lay themselves in ambush. When everything was&#xD;
arranged they observed the deepest ,silence, lstening with a sharp ear' for the&#xD;
approaching footstep of the victim they were ready to ensnare.&#xD;

When Lieutenant Sanders reached the Fort, he saw Grace standing in the            ferent craft, req&#xD;
door of the blockhouse with rather a troubled mien.' He walked up to h r, and      previous knowle&#xD;
no sooner had she seen his countenance, when her face brightened) in a meas-       Fort.&#xD;

one friendly face at last. 'I was near dying with restlessness."                   except fully eqi&#xD;
" But what's the matter, Aunt Grace?" he inquired, slightly startled b_ her      hawk with him&#xD;
excited manners.  .                                                                them.&#xD;
"The matter? Enough's the matter to set a person crazy.  There's  avid  -          Having.starte&#xD;
to commence with. He fell this morning dislocating his ankle in such a way         lower island nee&#xD;

has been missing ever since ten o'clock this morning."                             the bank, he no&#xD;
" Missing?" the Lieutenant inquired, becoming also alarmed. " How can she        was trampled d&#xD;
be missing? has she left the Fort?"  Jof one or severs&#xD;
"Of course she'has, or surely I would be able to find her. She left the F ort    sticking only a:&#xD;
and, I guess, went on the river."                                                  lock of gold, w&#xD;

Robert Campbell;- other persons who had a better right to do.it, being absent     felt convinced.&#xD;
as usual." continued. Th&#xD;

But it isn'tall. It is nigh four o'clock now, and they could have been back     the satisfactioin&#xD;

o cheer poor Grace in this way the Lieutenant hastened down to&#xD;

ral use, he shoved it into the river, and began to pull up stream&#xD;
rokes., In the East he had spent a great portion of his=time&#xD;

comrades in the Fort, he made it a practice, never to leave it,&#xD;
dipped, and he had on this occasion his rifle, knife and toma-&#xD;
, never dreaming though, that he might be called upon to use&#xD;
ed from the Fort about four o'clock, he reached the foot of the&#xD;
early an hour later. He had every moment expected to see the&#xD;
and her companion;, but thus far no.sign of either craft or crew&#xD;
ible, and Sanders began to be a little restless, \Vhenshe reached&#xD;

ticed traces of what appeared to him a struggle. The ground&#xD;

ith which a string of pearls was once held together. Now the&#xD;
en, thus accounting for the manner in-which the necklace had'&#xD;

But to gain further information his examinations had to be&#xD;

had received a truly barbarous treatment at the hands of parties&#xD;

Jump sends me; he wants eaver to send fifty warriors-north-east as fast as he&#xD;
can, to intercept a band of robbers. Red Feather must not be with them, Did&#xD;
the Red Fox understand?"&#xD;
As'the youth nodded he turned to one of the mnen and said: ." Walker will&#xD;
you take take him to Mrs. Jones-and see that he gets a good supper. The most&#xD;
willing mind is worthless without a vigorous body to supportit. Good-bye my&#xD;
boy; .God speed you! And now to my men. .ousee how it is. A handful of&#xD;
impudent Senecas have stolen our comrade's daughter at our very threshhold.&#xD;
If we suffer this they'll repeat the trespass. This must not be; we are therefore&#xD;
going to pursue the thieves! But to pursue is not enough. To catch, so sly a  4&#xD;
fo requires all the ability you can muster. Let each man therefore do his duty.&#xD;
Tou will first take a substantial supper and then start. Sergeant Willoughby.&#xD;
has been placed in command. He knows where I will meet him in the morn-&#xD;
ing, for I mean to start ahead of you and hunt up the lair of the game before&#xD;
you strike the blow. Farewell lads; to-morrow we'll meet again."&#xD;
There is something in a speech sometimes./ That of Robert had the effect of&#xD;
electrifying his men and caused them to enter cheerfully upon this duty. He&#xD;
himself did not wait to vatch the result. After a hasty farewell to Grace and,&#xD;
poor Anderson, who was doubly miserably on account of his disability and his&#xD;
mental ag py, he started on his night march through woods containing neither&#xD;
road nor path. Does the reader realize what it is to travel at night in a dense&#xD;
forest abounding with thorns, bushes; stumps, logs, rocks, ravines and the like.&#xD;

wever, did not go quite alone. He wasaccompanied by a little dog of           five minutes had hardly elapsed before he reached the cover of the'forest and&#xD;
ficant appearance, but of his-own training and which he prized greatly.        was enabled to stand up without exposing his person. Now he doubled his&#xD;

'noiselessly along. The dog'was evidently on a fresh trail, though the wind&#xD;
coming from their gear prevented him from benefiting as much by his keen scent&#xD;
as he would have done under more favorable circumstances.&#xD;
In this 'day they traveled a full hour until a somewhat lighter streak ahead&#xD;
informed the hunter of the neighborhood of the Connequenessing. He allowed&#xD;
,he dog to proceed to the 'water's edge, where, seating himself upon a, log, he&#xD;
reflected on his course, speaking at the same. time to his dog in a guarded way;&#xD;
Well, here we are Spy, and iftseems our game has taken to the water."&#xD;
e At this moment Spy crowded between hisiegs with the hair on his back stand-&#xD;
ing'erect. There was no mistaking these signs. Indians were near; perhaps he&#xD;
was already in an ambush. This was certainly a trying situation. A novice&#xD;
would have become alarmed and sought safety in flight, but the hunter knew&#xD;
the -Indian to be of a cat-like nature, that is fond of playing with its prey before&#xD;
devouring it. . If Indians were around-and of this he had no doubt-they would&#xD;
chuckle at his supposed security and give him all the playthey could in order&#xD;
to strike the final blow, when least suspected:_ Instead, therefore, of betraying&#xD;
his knowledge of their presence, the hunter resumed his-conversation wi  his&#xD;
dog: - We cannot swim like ducks or muskrats, Spy, and I guess we'd better&#xD;
stay here until morning and then go on the trail of these rascally thieves.',&#xD;
With these words the hunter sank behind the log, which'lay wi *its butt&#xD;
towards the cieek., 'Another forest giant lying parallel with it, the hunter was&#xD;
}     in a measure protected on both flanks and benefitted by these he crept with the&#xD;
noiseless and rapid'motions of the serpent into the deeper shade of the forest.&#xD;

They had everything in readiness to bind him; but to their great surprise the&#xD;
place was empty. They searched all around, becoming gradually noisy in&#xD;
their demonstrations, but, their search was unsuccessful. _ The Senecas-had&#xD;
heard'of Big Jump before, and this sudden disappearance on his part had filled&#xD;
them with a superstitious fear calculated to increase the respect they already&#xD;
entertained for the hunter. Red Feather,'on his part,'was'-filled with rage at&#xD;
this'disappointment, and would have vented it in a furious howl, if caution had&#xD;
notadictated the maintainance of silence in so dangerous a neighborhood. Nor&#xD;
would he totally relinquish the hope of yet capturing 'his enemy, and was on&#xD;
the-point' of instructing his men, when an approaching footstep became audible.&#xD;
There was their victim, again! The .eager expectation qf securing the hunter's&#xD;
person made them forget the phenomena of his previous disappearance, and&#xD;
placing themselves once more in ambush they awaited his arrival. He was&#xD;
walking along the bank of the creek and if the Indians had not been infatuated&#xD;
they would have noticed that his mode of proceeding was rather noisy for so&#xD;
celebrated a hunter. On the unsuspecting man came, and when he was oppo-&#xD;
site the ambush of the Indians Red Feather pounced upon him with a force that&#xD;
sent hint the ground. The hands of the chief clutched his throat and pre-&#xD;
vented the utterance of the slightest sound. Nor was he allowed to use his&#xD;
arms, for hey as immediately pinioned at both wrists and ankles. After that&#xD;
gag was a 'lied to his mouth; allowing the chief to withdraw and.leave the&#xD;
prisoner prostrate in the most helpless condition.   .&#xD;
" How feel now?" Maghpiway inquired as soon as his exultation and the re-&#xD;
covery of his breath would allow him to speak.. " You think, marry Wild Rose '&#xD;
now? You think take her to wigwam soon?"&#xD;
The prisoner, of course, gave no answer, the gag preventing him; but the&#xD;
chief expected none. There is a class of questions so significant, that they &#xD;
carry the answer on their face. The chief wanted to glory over a fallen foe and&#xD;
we are sorry to say, that he did not merely confine this practice to his tongue,&#xD;
but also applied his feet vigorously to the body'of his enemy. At last, however,&#xD;
he tired of the game, or may be the insecurity of the place, induced him to de-&#xD;
sist. He certainly quit and turning to the Senecas, gave them instructions for&#xD;
their future movements. He informed them that he had a second canoe con-.&#xD;
cealed a little further up stream, which he would fetch down in order to enable&#xD;
them to reach the mouth of the creek and from there start on their northward&#xD;
trip without delay. Then suiting his actions to. his words, he really went in&#xD;
quest of the canoe and after an absence of half an hour returned with the craft.&#xD;
The body of the prisoner was lifted jr  n  the Senecas having embarked, the&#xD;
canoe was pushed into the stream  owed to follow the current, 4b  ad-&#xD;
.dles-in the vessel being used both to qucken its motion and to keepit in th'e&#xD;
'channel. Maghpiway remained behind, glorying in the consummation of his&#xD;
vengeance. This meeting with Eagleheyl, had, indeed, been extremely'fortu-,&#xD;
nate. His own warriors would hardly hae ventured to assist him just at this&#xD;
time, the whole tribe being really anxious to make itspeace with the Ameri*&#xD;

cans. He stood there on the bank, gazingat the receding boat and anticipat-&#xD;
ing the moment, when the prisoner .would stand at the stake and in the. most&#xD;
excruciating tortures expiate the crime of having thwarted as great a:person as&#xD;
the Delaware chief. So deeply was he engaged in this pleasant pastime, that&#xD;
he failed to notice the movements of a form, stealing up to him with the noise-&#xD;
lessness of a spectre. All at once a shadow passed before his eyes, a thong&#xD;
drew his arms to his body before he had fully recovered from his consternation,&#xD;
he in turn lay prostrate on the ground, his life-ind destiny lying in the hands of&#xD;
he very man, whom he imagined to have just now sent to a northern den for&#xD;
safekeeping. It was indeed the hunter, who had been a witdeqs to the capture&#xD;
and embarkation of an individual unknown to him.  Gladly wduld he have in-&#xD;
terfered, if interests of less magnitude had been at stake. .He felt, that the re-&#xD;
covery of Rose Anderson depended mainly on his ability to lead the pursuit and&#xD;
so in spite of a foreboding, that nobody but Lieutenant Sanders had fallen into&#xD;
Red'Feather's hands, he abstained from making a diversion-in his favor.  He&#xD;
had often battled against greater bdds and might perhaps have remained victo-&#xD;
rious in this instance; but this precarious position of his comrade's  hter&#xD;
induced him to listen to the counsel of prudence in preference to the impulses&#xD;
of bravery. So the prisoner had been carried oft, the chief alone remained on&#xD;
the bank, thus offering our friend an excellent opportunity of secu  his per-&#xD;
Son. Robert had been near enough to hear the questions of the chief to the&#xD;
suppposed scout and he 'could not now resist the-tem'ptation to retaliate.&#xD;
How feel now?" he inquired. "You think marry Wild rose now? you&#xD;
think take her to wigwam soon?"&#xD;
On hearing this voice the chief fairly quaked with consternation.. This surely&#xD;
was the hunter, whom he believed to be now a prisoner and on hisway north.&#xD;
believing himself the prey of some supernatural agency, he remained perfectly&#xD;
silent, awaiting the action of his captor, that would decide his fate.  But the&#xD;
hunter was by no means sure of the best course to pursue. He knew.Maghpi-&#xD;
way to be guilty of conspiring against the whites, at least one of them,'that in-&#xD;
dividual being his own person. He knew that it would be dangerousto let him&#xD;
go again, saying nothing of the imprudence of having still increased his fury,&#xD;
and yet hekould not help wishing to have him off his hands, as with such a foe&#xD;
to guard he could not think of continuing the pursuit of the kidnappers. If&#xD;
the soldiers of the Fort would only come, it was surely time that they phopld&#xD;
be here.&#xD;
'And hark! even as this wish shaped itself into a thought, he heard the tramp&#xD;
of many feet. Most of the soldiers at tly  wore heady shoes, furnished&#xD;
them b   i$_ Government and their steg(osounder1thereforea great distance  ?4&#xD;
through tlie woods. The hunter had often execrated the clumsiness of these&#xD;
fellows; but it this instance his ear welco ed the noise with great satisfaction.&#xD;
He uttered a Veculiar whistle, which had been previously agreed upon as a sig-&#xD;
nal. It was. promptly answered and a fee minutes afterwards the men cro'*ded&#xD;
around the hunter.&#xD;

Whom have we here?" the sergeant inquired, as he came near stumbling .*&#xD;
over the prostrate farm of the chief,&#xD;
v  "Oh, merely a scoundrel chief belonging to the Delaware nation, who de-&#xD;
signed to favor me in a like manner, It is the fellow, who was at the Fort&#xD;
lately."&#xD;
Red Feather?"&#xD;
Exactly. I charge you to take good care of him, in order to prevent his&#xD;
escape."&#xD;
"We could leave a guard to watch him."&#xD;
"That would answer the purpose; in fact the main part of the men might a&#xD;
well remain here at present for all the good their traveling to night would do?'"Y&#xD;
Have you discovered any signs of the stolen girl?"&#xD;
Not yet; but I have witnessed the taking of another prisoner."&#xD;
"Another prisoner? Who in the world could that be?"&#xD;
"I neither saw his face nor heard his voice; but I could almost swear that it&#xD;
was the Lieutenant."&#xD;
"Sanders?"}&#xD;
" Course. He was the first to start on the trail,.without the necessary ex-&#xD;
perience to avoid the snares of the red devils. He might as well waited for all&#xD;
the good.he did; and if he gets away with a whole skin this adventure may do&#xD;
him goo4i:nd take the conceit out of him."&#xD;
"But they may kill him."&#xD;
" Not just now-I overheard the converstion of the rogues on that subject.  r',&#xD;
They are on the creek now, going to its mouth, to start nofth from there."&#xD;
Perhaps they might be overtaken."&#xD;
"It shall be tried at any rate. Pick me half a dozen fellows, who.can pull a&#xD;
trigger and set their feet down without shaking the ground for half a rne&#xD;
around."&#xD;
The Sergeant qpickly set to work and in less than five minutes presented the&#xD;
chosen party'to the hunter. Robert led them at once across the creek and af-&#xD;
terwards in a northern direction through the country between the Connequen -&#xD;
essing and Slippery Rock Creek. -The latter stream was forded by the party&#xD;
near the place where Wortemburg is now situated and then the norgern course&#xD;
changed to one a little more eastward. At last they .stopped.&#xD;
We shall soon know now," the hunter said, " whether the Indians are&#xD;
ahead of us or ndt. They can not be far either way, and half an hour's waiting&#xD;
will decide the matter. If-behind us they must pass here within that time, this&#xD;
being the only feasible course fol them to take.' If ahead of us we must let&#xD;
Spy find the trail and thentru --4sagacity.&#xD;
After these words the hunter an# is men retired to the thicketdn perfect si-&#xD;
lence. The wisdom of this soon beame apparent, as they had' hardly been&#xD;
ten minutes on their posts when foot' eps became audible approaching from a.&#xD;
southern direction.  -&#xD;
Make sure work of it," Robert whispered. " We cannot bother with pris-&#xD;

man and two and two of you the rest a piece.  Don't make a blunder though&#xD;
and shoot the prisoner; nor-waste your bullets on the tvirong carcass, for it is&#xD;
important that none should escape."&#xD;
This was all he said or could, say, for the J[ndians were- drawing near. Rob-&#xD;
ert had chosen his position well, calculating that the Indians would follow the&#xD;
most convenient route. The place formed a natural pass rising steeply on both&#xD;
sides and serving as: a drain to the country, several little runs wandering through&#xD;
5 ite bottom. The first quarter of, the moon just then sent its welcome light&#xD;
ver the tree tops to the bottom, revealing the forms of five men, who were&#xD;
en valking in Indian file, the prisoner marching in the middle, his hands tied&#xD;
and  is mouth still gagged. This' arrangement suited the party in ambush&#xD;
to perfection.. Deliberately they took aim, feeling no more compunction to&#xD;
shoot these Indians, than if they had been so many dogs.  The flash of the&#xD;
leader's rifle was the sign for the men to pull their triggers. And the shots be--&#xD;
ing almost simultaneous, not one of the Indians gained time to secure a cover.&#xD;
When the smoke cleared away the eye saw four bodies on the ground, writh-&#xD;
ing in the agonies of death. -The work was done and'that rapidly, bnt so un-&#xD;
expectedly, that neirher the victims nor the'prisoner had looked for it.  The&#xD;
poor fellow stood like one spell bound and he never moved until the voice of&#xD;
the hunter struck his ear.&#xD;
."Lieutenant Sanders, as sure as I live!"  Robert exclaimed, running up to&#xD;
him and without delay removed the fetters from his nouth'and arms. The of-&#xD;
ficer could not speakjfor some time, for the savages had applied the gag -with&#xD;
very little regard for the tongue or palate. _ -Nor were his wrists in a nuch bet-&#xD;
ter-conditioui, the thongs having completely rubbed the skin off.  R bert ie-&#xD;
solved to stop a while.and givethe -Leutenant time to.recruit his strength and&#xD;
recover, from his juries. His wrists were bathed with .whiskey and the same&#xD;
stuft also used inwardly with the best effect. After fifteen minutes Sanders was&#xD;
able to speak and give an account of -his capture, without dreaming that Rob-&#xD;
ert was pretty well informed concerning it.  The hunter said nothing though,&#xD;
abstaining also from any remarks on The somewhat rash exposure of hi's friend,&#xD;
as he deemed the lesson the officer had received fully sufficient to prevent a&#xD;
repetition of the blunder.                         *&#xD;
Under the salutary influence of his' rescue the spirits of the officer at once re-&#xD;
Aived and renmembering the perilous position of the kidnapped girl, he turned&#xD;
with an anxious mien to Robert for information.  The hunter could give him&#xD;
no other consolation, than that a latge forceofboth soldiers and Indians were&#xD;
in pursuit.  Having told him this, Robert relpsed into a marked silence, evi-&#xD;
dently revolving something ofimportance in-his mind. At last he startled like&#xD;
one that has formed his resolution, and turning to Sander; and his men, he&#xD;
said: "I think I have, it."-                             /&#xD;

chief, when he instructed the warriors, I overheard and understood everything&#xD;
he said. They were to take the Lientenant to some other chief in a cave. Now&#xD;
I know of a cave on the Neshannock and should not be at all surprised if it&#xD;
turned out the same Red Feather spoke about."&#xD;
Then let us ascertain without delay-! am fblly strong enough to stand the&#xD;
march now,"&#xD;
"Softly, friend, softly! The biggest hurry does not always secure the great&#xD;
est speed. Just listen to my plan now. These Indians were to take the pris-&#xD;
oner to the tare. Well, suppose we get up some mock Indians instead, leadin-&#xD;
you as a pretended captive-don't you think that would secure us the entrance &#xD;
of the cave?"&#xD;
" Upon my word, that is a good idea; but it would not work in daylight."-&#xD;
"You are right there, and that is the very reason why we must go-about it&#xD;
with due circumspection. It istoo late to reach the cave before'=morning, say-&#xD;
ing nothing about the uncertainty of its being the right one. We are therefore&#xD;
compelled to delay thething till to-morrow evening, when dusky begins to give&#xD;
our faces the right complexion."&#xD;
But think of what may befal poor Rose in the meantime."&#xD;
" It is true" he said, "by waiting that long we give her jailor a good deal of loiP&#xD;
sure for mischiet. Well, suppose we make a compromise of it and set out'at&#xD;
once: Rose must certainly have got tired in consequence of the long tramp&#xD;
over such rough ground and there is a bare possibility of our reaching the cave&#xD;
before her."&#xD;
"1Then for God's sake, let us try," the Lieutenant cried and his conjuration&#xD;
finding an echo in the hearts of the soldiers, the whole party again started on its&#xD;
fatiguing journey. As they advanced towards t'he north the- ground became&#xD;
more lev l, thus favoring a more rapid progress and diminishing the hardships&#xD;
of the march. At the first dawn of morning they struck Neshannock a creek,&#xD;
op whose banks the cave in question was known to lie,  Here they halted a&#xD;
while, the men taking frpmatheir pouches the scanty breakfast, with which they&#xD;
supplied-themselves at the Fort the evening before.  The Lieutenant being&#xD;
without any food whatever, received a small supply from each, relishing his&#xD;
corn bread and bacon much better than ever before in theFort.&#xD;
Our party rested for nearly an hour and then resuming their march, reached,&#xD;
the vicinity of the present town of Mercer towards noon.&#xD;
"iWe must be near the cave now," Robertlremarked.  " Althoug I openlyV&#xD;
confess my ignorance as to its exact location. From what I heard concerning&#xD;
it, it-opens under a very large rocky ledge. Do you see yon hill?  It lhoks'&#xD;
rocky enough to answer the description."-&#xD;
"Then we had better go near and examine it."  '&#xD;
"Exactly, only we must dbservesprecaution and not expose ourselves to sight.&#xD;
If the robbers are in the cave and catch a single glance of us, our chances 'of&#xD;
surprising them of course are gone. Fortunately the country seems well tim-&#xD;
bered to the very foot of the ledge."-&#xD;

Robert now began to approach the hill in the most cautious manner. Keep-&#xD;
ing his party well concealed in the dense undergrowth with which the woods&#xD;
were mostly lined there, he managed to get sufficiently near the ledge to ex-&#xD;
amine it closely. There was indeed a hole at its base, large enough to admit&#xD;
the figure of a man and evidently reaching some distance into the interior.&#xD;
"It must be the cave," Robert whispered, "but how we will learn whether it&#xD;
is tenanted or not without exposing our bodies to the bullets of its garrison, is&#xD;
more than I can, tell."&#xD;
"aSend Spy out and let him see," one of the men suggested.&#xD;
Robert now drew the attention of. the dog upon himself by calling his name.&#xD;
Then he pointed to the hole in the ledge, and said; "Spy, do you see that hole?&#xD;
Just you go and see whetheryou can discover any red skins there,  Go, Spy,&#xD;
thats a good dog,"    I&#xD;
The dog looked at him and then in the direction of the hole. Rob'ert repeated&#xD;
his order and all at once the cunning little fellow commenced to walk slowly&#xD;
and carefully to the suspicious aperture, He- smelled the ground before and in&#xD;
the entrance, but soon returned to his master without betraying signs of ex-&#xD;
citement. Robert'patted him on the head,&#xD;
"That decides the natterr" he said, "I am as sure now that the cave is&#xD;
empty as if I had been through the whole of it. We may as well go in and&#xD;
take possession."&#xD;
t        eWhy, this seems to be a capital sort of a place," he said, "and we must man-&#xD;
age to procure some pine knots in order to explore it.  I think I noticed some&#xD;
spruce pines without."&#xD;
He stepped out into the open air followed by some of the nen, who by means&#xD;
of their tomahawks soon procured a sufficient quantity of pitchy pine 5wood 'to&#xD;
last them through the proposed investigation of the cave. After striking fire&#xD;
with their steel and flint, they lit one of the knots and without delay proceeded&#xD;
to the perpendicular descent above mentioned. It proved to be only a'few feet&#xD;
deep and having reached its bottom, the explorers entered a large and spacious&#xD;
passage of considerable beauty,  This in turn shrank into such dwarfish di-&#xD;
mensions, that they could hardly effect a passage in single file. At its end the&#xD;
cave once more widened into a laige and vaulted hall, echoing the voices of&#xD;
the visitors in a startling manner.  After this hall there. was another narrow&#xD;
Passagee, then a hall again and thus wide and narrow places followed one&#xD;
another, until all at once day light mixed with their torchlights and the cave ter-&#xD;
minated in a passage on the other side of the hill,&#xD;
'i-This is indeed wore beautiful-ihan I expected," Robert said, " The cave is&#xD;
a citidal; which I would hold against a hundred men; provided I had plenty of&#xD;
food and a trusty companion, ' Without'that this cave tight, turn-out a very&#xD;
ugly trap,a splendid sepulchre withal. So the first thing for us to do will be to&#xD;
provide for sudden emergencies by .killing some game- or other, for Indianti&#xD;
about or no about, we cannot live on air. Over yonder I see a nice' buck; just&#xD;
stay where you are and let me try to get a shot at him,"&#xD;

The hunter crept 'towards an opening in the bottom, where several deer were&#xD;
pasturing. In those days it was comparatively easy to steal up to them, as the&#xD;
few roving Indians were insufficient to disturb their feeling of security. Rob-&#xD;
ert moreover was a skillful hunter and before the expiration of a quarter of an&#xD;
hour his men heard the crack of his rifle: Going up to him they found a fine&#xD;
buck, which his bullet had killed on the spot. With their united strength they&#xD;
succeeded in carrying ijt into the' cave and having thus secured the needful sup-&#xD;
ply forgeveral clays, they began to feel more at their ease. The cave was very&#xD;
cool, especially the interior department and meat .woukl keep here a whole&#xD;
week without spoiling.  As they had a sufficient amount of food in. their'&#xD;
pouches and disliked to kindle a fire, the smoke of which might betray them to&#xD;
distant Indians, they merely dragged the buck into the second vault and then&#xD;
divided their company and placing a party at each entrance, patiently and si-&#xD;
lently looked for the Seneca chief and his captive. Robe rt joined the party&#xD;
guarding the opening through which they had first entered, because he thought&#xD;
it probable that the Indians would appear there first. Nor was he mistaken.'&#xD;
A little before sunset three red men were noticed to approach the cave, .lead-&#xD;
ing a female captive in the highest state of exhaustion. Robert at once recog-&#xD;
nized Rosa Anderson, and a deep compassion filled his heart when he saW her&#xD;
frightful condition. Two Indians had to support her and the hunter might have&#xD;
wondered at this complete exhaustion of so young and vigorous a constitution&#xD;
after a comparatively short period of suffering, if his experience had not taught&#xD;
him that mental agony is as fatiguing as physical exertion.  He was glad that&#xD;
;an4ers was with the party at the other entrance, partly because his absence&#xD;
saved him the painful aspect of his mistress in such a miserable plight, partly&#xD;
because it prevented any sudden, demonstrations into which the Lieutenant&#xD;
might have been driven by his excitement. As it was, Robert could carry out&#xD;
the measures on which he had resolved during the hours of waiting. These&#xD;
measures of course depended on circumstances, and the hunter had instructed&#xD;
his companions with a view to them.' If the Indians advanced in such a nan-&#xD;
ner as to make the use of the rifle practicable, the men were to fire; but under&#xD;
no conditions was the life of Rosa Anderson to be endangered. 1f the rifle&#xD;
could not be used they were to let the Indians pass and throw themselves upon&#xD;
them, to finish the work with the knife pnd tomahawk.&#xD;
Thus instructed the party allowed the Indians to enter the mouth of the cave .&#xD;
The close proximity of two of them to the girl forbade the use of the rifle, and&#xD;
thus the silent steel must do the work. The sun was near the horizon, and&#xD;
was sufficiently shaded by the trees to hide from a superficial observer the slight&#xD;
marks left on the-stony surface. The chief, eager to reach the cave, did not&#xD;
stdp to examine the ground, but came on in advance until he reached the per-&#xD;
pendicular descent. here he allowed his companions to pass him, and prepar-&#xD;
ed to light a torch vhich he had brought along. The others turned to watch&#xD;
the operation and they were facing Robert's party, which the lighting of the&#xD;
torch would have revealed to the Indians.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVER.                lot&#xD;
Now,     ted Robert, and burying' his knife in the chief's bosom. Eagle-&#xD;
head dropped with the blade in his heart, and the torch became extinguished by&#xD;
the fall: The companions of the scout mdved a second too late, thus giving the&#xD;
other Indians a glimpse of their danger.: They at once dropped the girl and&#xD;
commenced a retreat. One succeeded in merely making one bound, when he&#xD;
received a knife in his; breast. His companion, however, merely received a&#xD;
flesh wound and shaking off his assailant :succeeded in reaching the passage&#xD;
which lead to the interior of the-cave. The darkness greatly favored his escape&#xD;
and he fled with all speed. As he advanced without hearing signs of pursuit&#xD;
,.4his hope revived; and'he was on the point of rushing into the last passage when&#xD;
the sight of the guards at the entrance checked him, but only for an.instant.&#xD;
With a rush he felled the guard in his path, leaped his prostrate body and clear-&#xD;
ed the entrance before the rest of the guard recovered from their surprise'. Once&#xD;
in the open air he quickly plunged into the thicket which\ covered the greater&#xD;
part of the bottom. Sanders and his men sprang out for a parting shot but they&#xD;
were too late. After consultation they concluded not to go in pursuit until the&#xD;
arrival of the other party, which could be looked for with certainty.&#xD;
Let us anticipate this arrival and return to watch the movements of Robert&#xD;
and his party after the assault on the Indians. Robert at once lighted the torch&#xD;
dropped by the chief, and stepped to the girl, who half lay, half sat on 'the&#xD;
ground irta state of utter prostration. 'As they gently tried to lift her up, she&#xD;
freed herself from their grasp and sank upon her knees, and raising her hands&#xD;
in supplication said in heart-rending accents&#xD;
Mercy! Oh,"have mercy upon a poor forsaken girl!"&#xD;
Robert remained silent for fear that his well-known voice would create a re-&#xD;
action, equally dangerous. So one of the soldiers said: " Why, my good girl,&#xD;
we are friends, come to rescueyou from the red-skinned devils. ~ Don't you&#xD;
know me?? I'm Sam Sullivan,.and here is Pete Ingolsby. So cheer up, child."&#xD;
At first his words seemed to make no impression; but bynd-by'the sounds&#xD;
of her mother tongue struck a 'kindred chord and she began to look around&#xD;
with growing eagerness. Robert now deemed it time to show himself.&#xD;
Rose," he said with a low voice, "you may believe hiin. We--"&#xD;
"Robert! Good God, is it possible?"&#xD;
This was all she could utter. Her emotions were too powerful'for her weak-&#xD;
ened frame, and with a moan she sank into unconsciousness.&#xD;
She has fainted, poor girl," said Robert. "Sam, bring her here to the wa-&#xD;
ter and let me bathe her temples. ,There, I can manage her now. Light the&#xD;
pine knots we left at the entrance; anm then track the fellow that gave us the&#xD;
slip. It -won't do to let him escape, for he might bring the whole Seneca tribe&#xD;
down upon us before we can move. Take Pete and the others with you."&#xD;
His orders were promptly obeyed and he was left alone with the unconscious&#xD;
girl. - Patiently and gently he bathed her face and temples until finally she open-&#xD;
ed her eyes. After wandering a moment they 'fixed upon the hunter's face and&#xD;
showed both recognition and delight. Robert put his flask to her lips, pouring&#xD;

I t             THE WILD ROSE OF THE BEAVER,&#xD;
a few drops of the liquor down her throat. This acted as a pp  tonic and&#xD;
with the hunter's assistance she raised herself to a sitting postur.&#xD;
" Oh, Robert, how grateful I am to you: for this! You saved me from drown-&#xD;
ing; but in freeing me from the Indians you have done an infinitely greater favor.'&#xD;
"I am glad I could be of service to yot, Rose; but I alone must not receive&#xD;
all the credit for what others did as well, There is one person here vAho would'&#xD;
give his heart's blood to save you a pang.of pain'&#xD;
"This is not the moment to dissemble, Robert," Rose said, coloring, "so I&#xD;
-shall not pretend I do not understand. I am very glad he thought it worth the&#xD;
while to come for me though his conduct of late made me think difterdntly."&#xD;
3R '  Ie vas laboring under a delusion, Rose, which has now left him, But he&#xD;
may tell you that himself; for unless -I am much mistaken I hear him coming."&#xD;
The'glimpse of a light and confused pounds penetrated the cave, and in a few&#xD;
minutes the whole party made its appearance in the passage, Sanders evidently&#xD;
had been warned beforehand,-for he had no sooner seen the girl than he kneeled&#xD;
down at her side and enclosed her in his arms. Neither spoke, and the others.,&#xD;
turned aside, that the meeting between them might be sacred.&#xD;
"Dear Rose," the Lieutenant at last exclaimed, "this is more happiness than&#xD;
deserve; can you pardon my short-sighted folly?"&#xD;
I pardon your coldnees without knowing its cause-does that suffice?"&#xD;
No, Rose, for I owe yon ari explanatiory which I shall give youit a later&#xD;
hour. Now we must not think of anything but your speedy restoration and re.&#xD;
moval from this place." Calling to Robert he said; "I look to you for help;&#xD;
-you have found her, and you will also devise means to take'her to the Fort."&#xD;
I'll try my best, Lieutenant, but I fear the escape of that Indian will brew&#xD;
trouble."&#xD;
You mean the-one that upset me? He came very unexpectedly."&#xD;
"I do not blame you for the escape. I only say it was unfortunate, The&#xD;
country of the Senecas is not far off and their bands often roam beyond their&#xD;
boundaries, If the runaway should fall in with such a one-"&#xD;
welll, what would be the consequence? They would not dare attack us!"&#xD;
"iDid this chief hesitate?  They will dare anything when their passions bid&#xD;
them. If Eaglehead is any person of consequence, we may look for trouble."&#xD;
[  I" Then we had better start for the Fort without delay."&#xD;
"With Rose in this condition? No, that would hardly answer, She'll have&#xD;
to make a good part of the way on foot, and I'd sooner wait here in one spell&#xD;
than a dozen on the road,"&#xD;
"But, Robert, the joy of being rescued has refreshed me wonderfully. I&#xD;
think I could stand the fatigue of the journey even now."&#xD;
"You think you can-I know you cannot. Excuse my bluntness Rose; but&#xD;
my words are dictated by my wishes for your welfare. You must now eat and&#xD;
sleep; to-morrow we'll-see about the rest. Sam and Pete, if you will gather&#xD;
dry leaves for a bed I will attend to cutting up and frying our venison. Two of&#xD;
xis must guard the mouths, Lieutenant you may watch here, and Isaac you&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
tiay com       e to the other opening. It would not do to sufle a surprise."&#xD;
Again th   en set to work to carry out these orders.  A bed of leaves was&#xD;
procured and after Rose had partaken of the savory steak, which Robert' pre&#xD;
-     pared with rare'skill, she stretched her weary limbs upon-the soft bed in a fev&#xD;
minutes'wa's asleep,'thus verifying the hunter's opinionconcerning her ability&#xD;
as toan immediate departure. The others also delivered theiniseves to rest and&#xD;
61eep, ekeepting the guards who relieved each other every few hours. Robet&#xD;
was the only person who refused to shut his eyes:  He had suffered too, niuch&#xD;
from the blunders of others=to allow himself to become the preys under such&#xD;
critical circumstances. 'le wakened'the relief parties and kept everything in&#xD;
order until a faint streak-in the eastern sky indicated the approach of morning. 4-&#xD;
Thenhe woked the sleep   'convoked the guards.&#xD;
Friends," he said,'" we must part at once, for so actionn and prt dencc&#xD;
dictate to us. If we gain nothing b our speed, we certainly cannot lose by it.&#xD;
One of you must go in advance of the main body,:not so much for discover-&#xD;
ing foes, as for finding friends.  There is a large body of 'Delaware ,Indians&#xD;
between the Neshannocl and the Slipery Rock Creek now, and this body must&#xD;
be hurried up as Soon as possible. Sam, you understand their tongue; will you&#xD;
undertake the job for me?"&#xD;
"Of course,'I will, Robert and with all my heart. - Shall I go now?"&#xD;
" Yes; I suppose you'll halie no trouble in findling your-way?"&#xD;
" I hope not Robert. You expect me to lead them the same route we came?&#xD;
"Well, yes, that will do; the creek may possibly be of some service .to us.&#xD;
Yod may lead them that way-' Sam, but be quick. You understand."&#xD;
"Aye, aye, sir. The sooner I'm off the sooner I'll be back."&#xD;
"Now to the rest. Lieutenant take charge of Rose.'Keep close to her and&#xD;
adhere to her through thick and thin. "That case being disposed, there's six&#xD;
left including myself. Of them one may assist the Lieutenant. Isaac you go&#xD;
with him. . The rest may stay with me'to cover the rear, Having no leisure&#xD;
for a breakfast here each man'must take his'share along, and trust to chance.&#xD;
Thus everything is arranged. Lieutenant move forward with your  charge."&#xD;
Five minutes'later the cave was'empty, and away to the south a few miles&#xD;
could be discovered in the gr y dawn a line of silent stealing noiselessly thro'&#xD;
the forest.&#xD;
"I do not know what ails me," Robert said to his'companions. " I am gen-&#xD;
erally above forebodings; but this morning I can hardly,- keep from delivering&#xD;
myself up to gloomy thoughts. Just  ay here a little while, I must retrace our&#xD;
steps and see whether there is any occasion for alarm,&#xD;
Accordingly the men stopped and Robert returned on his own trail, examin.&#xD;
ing everything with the greatest possible care and attention. At last he reached&#xD;
the summit of an, eminence,'which, though not-very high, raised Its top consid-&#xD;
erably above its neighbors, Not satisfied with this chance for a sight,-Robert&#xD;
climbed into the top of a tall tree and thus obtained a veryextensive view to the&#xD;
north ani-northeast. Although he was at-that time fully three miles distance from&#xD;

the cave he could distinctly see the ledge containing its mouth:  ore than&#xD;
that! at a second sharp glance he saw quite a number of human gures run-&#xD;
ning up and down the hill, evidently excited like a swarm of bees into whose&#xD;
hive a foreign element has forced its way. To see it and to know that a body&#xD;
hostile Indians had malje their appearance at the cave, probably led thither by&#xD;
the successful fugitive, was the work of the same moment. Gliding rapidly&#xD;
to the ground, he returned to his comrades as fast as he could and in a few&#xD;
words informed them of his discovery.&#xD;
"We have at best a start of them of two or three miles," he said thoughtfully.&#xD;
"But what is that considering our slow progress?  They can make two miles'&#xD;
to our oite if they choose, and of this you may rest assured. In twos hours at&#xD;
farthest they will be upon our heels and then we shall be in a tight place if our&#xD;
friinds,.fail in bringing timely succor."&#xD;
The others looked at each other with rather serious faces.&#xD;
"Couldn't we out run them, Robert?" Peter inquired.&#xD;
"We might for a short time, but not in the long run. WWe must try to reach&#xD;
a place here we can entrench ourselve until our friends arrive. If we can only&#xD;
hold out until to-night we may safely look for relief."&#xD;
They now resumed their march, hurrying up to the girl and hercompanions.&#xD;
Rose read the state of affairs in the soldiers' faces, and turned to Robert saying:&#xD;
I see your expectation has proved correct; you have seen Indians?"&#xD;
Well, it's no use tb deny a fict that will become evident."&#xD;
It we cannot escape I want you to kill me before I. fall into their hands."&#xD;
"Why, Rose, it is not so bad as that. If we succeed ifn -raching a place&#xD;
where we can hold out against the odds our friends will rescue us in due time."&#xD;
And do you know'of such a place?" the Lieutenant inquired.&#xD;
I know of one; but we'll have to move lively in order to reach it in time.&#xD;
Here, Lieutenant, take Rose's right arm, and, Isaac, take the left one. Now&#xD;
forward, but steady, for we have several miles to go.'&#xD;
The others acted in accordance with his instructions, and for more than two&#xD;
miles the party kept up a rapidgait. The hunter kept watch in the rear, and&#xD;
when-they reached the foot of a long ridge running parallel with the creek, he&#xD;
deemed it prudent to -make another recoinnoisance. Suddenly he started, and&#xD;
well he might, for the Indians whom be imagined at least a'mile behind, ran at&#xD;
that moment across an opening not quite one-fourth of that distance away from&#xD;
them. They were so numerous, and seemed so full of confidence that they dis-&#xD;
dained to conceal their approach for their supposed victims.&#xD;
You seem very sure of catching us," the hunter soliloquized, as he hastened&#xD;
after his companions; "but you may be disappointed."&#xD;
Friends," he cried- "now run for your lives. What we have done is child's,&#xD;
play to what we must do. Follow this ridge until you come to its end; there&#xD;
stop and wait for me. I'll stay behind with Pete and teach these fellows better&#xD;
.manners than following white people."&#xD;
The Lieutenant and Rose with four soldiers quickened their flight while Rob-..&#xD;

ert and Peter dropped somewhat behind. They could hear the forerunners of&#xD;
their foes coming nearer and nearer.&#xD;
" Now Peter, watch what I am going to say," the -hunter said as coolly as if&#xD;
he meant to enlarge on rabbit shooting. " I'll show you what I call a running&#xD;
fight. I picked you in preference, because'you are the steadiest man aid have&#xD;
the best rifle. , -Mind, I say rifle, because I intend to do the shooting part my-&#xD;
self. We cannot afford to waste' a single bullet and though you shoot well&#xD;
Saenough under ordinary circumstances, you wil allow that I do -a little better&#xD;
yet. Well, I shall shoot at the foremot one of these dusky devils and of course&#xD;
bring him dow . That will stop them for a minute' or two, I warrant you.. In&#xD;
the meantime we swap rifles and you load, If the verTnin becomes troublesome&#xD;
again, we give them another dose and so on, until we are in camp. Do you&#xD;
comprehend me, Peter?"&#xD;
" I think I do," Peter said with a chuckle, and greatly increased confidence&#xD;
in the issue of the fight.&#xD;
"Then we may as well begin the dance, Do you see, they begin to pepper&#xD;
away at us, although they only vaste their bullets. Take that,tree Peter."&#xD;
Peter obeyed orders, and Robert took his station near him behind another&#xD;
tree. The Indians meanwhile advanced unconscious of their danger, until all at&#xD;
once the rifle of the scout cracked, and the foremost Indian dropped dead upon&#xD;
the ground.&#xD;
"Do you see how they run, Peter? Just like a flock of sheep. Now give me&#xD;
your gun and load mine; but don't put in too much powder-I hate a kicking&#xD;
gun."&#xD;
During these words they leisurely retreated from tree to tree, now and then&#xD;
sending a deadly shot into the ranks of their enemies .whenever they were bold&#xD;
enough to show themselves. By and by, however; the. bullets of the Indians&#xD;
began to fly in various directions, showing that the savages had begun to&#xD;
spread 'with the intention of cutting them oft.&#xD;
"Now it is time, Peter," the hunter exclaimed, taking to his heels again.&#xD;
They must not circumvent us, and if we stay here much longer such a thing&#xD;
is not impossible. So, here is.our redoubt, and unles they have some six pound.&#xD;
ers wit 'them, we can laugh at their efforts for the next eight hours to come."&#xD;
Thfplace which they now reached was well adapted for the purpose of the&#xD;
hunter, The ridge did not only come thereto a sudden end, terminating ii a&#xD;
steep ledge of at least twenty feet; but it also narrowed on both sides, running.&#xD;
like the, backbone of a huge animal-to a dull point.  The thin soilof the ridge&#xD;
produced nothing but here and there a scanty bush; thus preventing the capture&#xD;
of the place by surprise, while the defense of the point wazgreatly faciliated by&#xD;
large boulders surrounding it in a rather irregular curve, and enclosing a space&#xD;
of some twenty feet in diameter. He the hunter and his companion found&#xD;
the rest of the party, Rose being in, a grekl flutter over the shooting occasioned&#xD;
by what. he called his running #ght.. She therefore welcomed his arrival with&#xD;
a sigh of relief and a deep felt "Thank God!&#xD;

"I hope you will have a'chance to thank God for many future blessings yet,&#xD;
that is if you protect your head a little better than you did just now.  A few&#xD;
lines to the right and your lovely face would now lie low penetrated by an ounce&#xD;
of lead. Lieutenant, you try your luck and see if she will mind you."&#xD;
' Rose smiled, but obedient to his hint assumed a position where she would be&#xD;
safe from the bullets of the Indians.  The others stationed themselves accord&#xD;
ing to the directions of the hunter, and for more than four hours an intessent&#xD;
fire was kept up by both parties. The besieged sustained -no loss whatever, and,&#xD;
as the assailants took good care not to expose themselves, only now and then a'&#xD;
shot from the rifle of the scout took effect.&#xD;
"This is extremely tiresome,' Robert said with a yawn. " If the Indians are&#xD;
as sick of it as I, they will surely stop this useless waste of lead and powder."&#xD;
"But do-you think they will, Robert?" Rose inquired.&#xD;
"That's hard to say. If they stop shooting now, however, you must not take&#xD;
that as an indication that they will stop trying to get us in their clutches. No,&#xD;
indeed, you must give them credit for more perseverance than that, especially&#xD;
at a time when their chances keep on improving."&#xD;
"Improving? how so, Robert?"       .&#xD;
"IWhy don't you see, the afternoon is nearly. spent-and that we can never'&#xD;
hope of holding this place if they are determined to make a night assault? It&#xD;
would cost then some men to be sure, but would undoubtedly put them in&#xD;
possession of the Fort and its garrison."-&#xD;
"then we must try'to escape from them in the dark."&#xD;
"That would be the best; but that is easier said than done. If we only had&#xD;
a canoe, we might possibly escape by water."                  44&#xD;
"A canoe! Let me see. The chief took me in a canoe up stream; but I do&#xD;
not know exactly where he landed. It cannot have been far from here eiTher,&#xD;
as I remembered most, of the country on my return."&#xD;
"Well, we must make the attempt at any rate. To remain here would be&#xD;
madness; for the Indians can attack us on all sides. The slopes are steep, but&#xD;
not enough so to prevent a skilful climber to reach the top. I am afraid they&#xD;
will hardly give us time to perfect our arrangements."&#xD;
-'And you mean to try it on the river side?" Sanders inquired.&#xD;
Yes, there lies our best chance, poor as it is. We may run away from them&#xD;
a little vays, but in the end they are sure to 'capture us, if our friends do not&#xD;
succor us before long6  Indeed I wonder-"&#xD;
His words were cut oft by a loud hurrah and, huzza, evidently emanating&#xD;
from white throats. At the same time Indian war whoops sounded through the&#xD;
woods creating very Iier nt feelings in the hearts of the hearers.&#xD;
"Cheer, Sanders! Rose! cheer boys!", the hunter cried, setting himself up&#xD;
as an example for his summons.&#xD;
d But there are Indians too, Roberte Rose inquired.&#xD;
"iThey are Delawares, child. - I know their war-cry too well to bemistaken,&#xD;
Yes, our men and the warriors of the Beavet-have come together, thus ,ac,&#xD;

" Exactly, Beaver; but you would mumhpbl&#xD;

and help you, fearing for your safety. 'She will be happy to receive yot at her&#xD;
lodge to-morrow."&#xD;
I            " Well, I hall go with you and with your permission take the soldiers also.&#xD;
There will soon be peace now between the White and red men and the more&#xD;
frequently they meet the sooner they will lose the hatred, which as yet animates&#xD;
them to some extent."&#xD;
Thus it was arranged 'and carried put, Venison being plentiful, there was&#xD;
an abundance of food,-the first and indispensible condition for man's good hu-&#xD;
mor. A good bed these hardy .frontiersmen valued much less, and both In=&#xD;
dians and white men passed what they considered a very pleasant night.&#xD;
*  IIn the morning, after a very informal breakfast the two bodies began their&#xD;
-march to the Indian village. The canoe of Red Feather being found, Rose and&#xD;
her friends made the trip by water.  The-weather was beautiful and the com&#xD;
pany as gay as could be expected, a certain gloomy recollection of the past&#xD;
trial still remaining.  Sanders was' also in the canoe but less gay than all the&#xD;
rest. -He kept thinking of the obstacles still in his road to happiness and only&#xD;
the affectionate glances of Rose were able to rouse him from his reverie. All at&#xD;
opee the Lieutenant started. He had felt in his pouch and discovered the neck-&#xD;
lace of-Rose, which he had carried ever since his visit to the island. He showed&#xD;
it to the girl, whose joyful exclamation was the best thanks he could wish to&#xD;
have. Anderson also evinced his satisfaction.&#xD;
"This chain I gave her'when a child and it has always been a source of mourn-&#xD;
ful pleasure. I bought two of them, one for .ose and the other for her sister,&#xD;
and I can never look at this chain without thinking of her dreadful death. ' And&#xD;
now my surviving daughter came near sharing her fate.  I feel, indeed, most&#xD;
grateful to the Almighty who has so visibly protected her."&#xD;
Rose tied the necklace around her neck and the canoe sped on Its way until&#xD;
the Indian village was reached.  The party landed and the hunter led them to&#xD;
the juse of the Beaver. Wild Rose stood in the door, playing the hostess in-&#xD;
stead of per father, who had not yet arrived. Robert ran to meet her and beg&#xD;
fore the whole company drew her to his heart,&#xD;
Welcome'Robert," she said lovingly and with a shy grace, extremely beau-&#xD;
tiful, " Wild Rose'is glad to see her husband safe hpme."&#xD;
Her husband!" Anderson exclaimed, being unable to control the expres-&#xD;
sion of disdainful disappointment, which the sight created in his heart. "I de= 4&#xD;
Clare you are a sly dog, Robert, and henceforth-"&#xD;
."Henceforth you will oblige me by treating this lady with the respect she de-&#xD;
serves. She will be my married wife in a few weeks and as such command&#xD;
universal regard, I hope."&#xD;
It is doubtful how Anderson would have replied if nothing had interrupted&#xD;
the conversation. As it was the arrival of the Beaver drew upon him the at-&#xD;
tention of the party. He shook handh with all, and cordially' invited them&#xD;
l                  to the hospitality of his house. When he came to Rose Anderson, he started&#xD;
and his'eye fixed itself steadily upon the girl.  A close observer, however,&#xD;

*outd have noticed that it was no less than the necklace of the girl, which at.&#xD;
tracted his attention. After a few minutes the-chief recovered from his, emo.&#xD;
tion.  He turned to Anderson and asked; "Is that your daughter?"&#xD;
''Yes, chief, ry only daughter;"&#xD;
"And this hecklace-how did she get it?"&#xD;
" Why, of course, I gave it to her; how do you come to ask such a question?"&#xD;
"You shall hear.  Did you live on the western slope of the Allegheny&#xD;
Mouhtalns twenty years ago?"&#xD;
" Yes, I did," the scout said; becoming more attentive.&#xD;
"Was your house burned by the red.,men?" &#xD;
"It was, and I hever forgave the reimen either; for mywife and child were&#xD;
cruelly butchered on'that occasion."&#xD;
"Did your other daughter wear a like necklace?"&#xD;
"She did, Beave. But why torment one with such useless questions? They&#xD;
only grleve,me, and unless you give me the key to them I shall refuse to answer:"&#xD;
The chief stood the prey-of a powerful emotion. . His body shook under the&#xD;
powerful struggle. At last, however, he conquered. Leaving the astonished&#xD;
company he stepped into the house and shortly returned with a necklace at the&#xD;
sight of which Anderson started.&#xD;
"Is this the necklace of your lost child?" the chief asked in a dejected manner,&#xD;
" It is. ' See her name engraved on the lock, ' Mary Anderson'?"&#xD;
The scout stared at the trinket, but his emotions were not altogether of a joy-&#xD;
ful nature. With a sinister glance at the chief, he finally exclaimed; "Chief, 1&#xD;
ought to thank you for this; but indeed I cannot, Perhaps you know..the mur-&#xD;
derersi -perhaps you-" -&#xD;
" Yes, I knew them, for I was there; but I did not participate in the deed. I&#xD;
pan proudly say that I never steeped my hands in the blood of women and chil-&#xD;
dren," replied the chief with a proud and noble mein,&#xD;
"You say you cannot thank me for the necklace," he resumed. Perhaps you&#xD;
can and will thane me for your daughter-there she is, take her. The Lod e of&#xD;
the Beaver will be lonely not; but he wants to be just before he is happy.&#xD;
During these words -he poi ted to Wild Rose, who stood by an attentive lis-&#xD;
tener. After he had spoken e wrapped himself in his blanket and turned aside&#xD;
presenting a picture of dignified-grief and manly resignation more than which&#xD;
the history of Rome ever furnished. On the company this communication act-&#xD;
edflike an electricshock. Anderson started, and seizing the chief's arm, said&#xD;
imploringly: " Can this be true? ' It is not a cruel mockery merely to deride the&#xD;
feelings of a Lather?"&#xD;
The Great Spirit is my witness that I have spoken true. With my own&#xD;
hands;I carried thechild from the house and never for a moment has she left&#xD;
the lodge of her foster-father. ZNov the Beaver will see her no mdre-she will&#xD;
go to gladden the home of the stranger, that never knew or loved her."&#xD;
Anderson was satisfied. With steps trembling with emotion he turned to&#xD;
Wild Rose and with outstretched arms exclaimed: "Marys my child"&#xD;

I 10k            THE WILDY RO~hS OF  ~T BEVER(.&#xD;
But Wild Rose did not stir. When he nade an effort' to embrace her she&#xD;
simply took his hands, half in a spirit of remonstrance, half in that of a caress,&#xD;
and said with a sweet smile, but in affirm voice:&#xD;
"My father? I am glad to have found one among the pale-faces; butif I&#xD;
thought he would want me to forsake myfrst father I should feel exceedingly&#xD;
sorry. The Beaver has nursed me in the helpless days of infancy, should I now&#xD;
repay good with evil, and forsake him in his age? Wild Rose cannot be so base."&#xD;
Anderson listened-to his daughter with a mixture of surprise and love Wild&#xD;
Rose could not read nor write, nor do all the other things which her sister un-&#xD;
derstood; but in the exercise of high and noble virtues. she was her superior.&#xD;
Not that theggirl at the Fort had not pcsessed these virtues, but they compared&#xD;
with those of Wild Rose as the bud with the full blown flower.&#xD;
Anderson, as we said, admired the magnanimity of his daughter.&#xD;
"How can you hare so poor an opinion of your father? You shall not only&#xD;
continue to love the Beaver-nay your white father will vie with you in your&#xD;
love for the red one. Is my daughter satisfied?"&#xD;
"My father is very good, but Wild Rose has other favors to ask. My father&#xD;
has two daughters-will he allow me to give him also two sons?"&#xD;
Two sons!" Anderson exclaimed. I have an idea where one of them might&#xD;
be found, but the other-"&#xD;
Wild Rosetook Robert by one hand and Sanders by the other.&#xD;
"Does my father now see his sons? could he wish for better ones?"&#xD;
Anderson was taken in. For 'a moment the shadow of a frown passed over&#xD;
his face, but he was unable to preserve a serious countenance. Drawing Wild&#xD;
Rose 'to his heart with an ecstacy of delight such as had not lit up his face for&#xD;
many a day, he exclaimed:&#xD;
"You are a perfectlittle vixen. You are fair to look at; but you are more&#xD;
cunning than fair, and more good than cunning. Here, Rosy, don't .you, want&#xD;
to hug this sister of yours?"&#xD;
"Yes, father, as soon as I get a chance. Thus far you have kept her to yOur-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"Well, go ahead, child, and in the meantime I'll look at this other son of&#xD;
mine. How comes it, Sir Lieutenant, that you never spoke of this wish before?"&#xD;
"I did, sir, begging your pardon."&#xD;
"So? You did? Well, that makes your case only worse, for as far as I can&#xD;
see you applied at the wrong door."&#xD;
"-How could'I come to you knowing your inveterate hatred to all the uni-&#xD;
formed servants of the commonwealth?"&#xD;
" Aye, aye, true enough. But still I preserve my opinion concerning them.&#xD;
If I make an exception in your favor that does not affect the rule. But I see the&#xD;
girls are through with the huggin' process and you will most likely want to&#xD;
come in for your share now. Or have you already tasted of forbidden fruit?"&#xD;
In that way father Anderson endeavored to drown the excitement to which-he&#xD;
had fallen a prey. , By and by he cooled down, however, and so did the whole&#xD;

student to converse and write in this important idiom in a&#xD;
very short time.&#xD;

former including, the latter excluding, Latin. No extra&#xD;
charges for studies outside of the regular course.&#xD;
