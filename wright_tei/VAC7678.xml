This time Hartkins drew from beneath&#xD;
his counter a long, black battle,, which&#xD;
was soon emptied of it~ contents, and&#xD;
pronounced "A No, I" by all, with the~&#xD;
exception of Paddy Q'Murphy, who in&#xD;
all cases preferred the genuine "extract&#xD;

drew their seats around the table, and&#xD;
the captain commenced lAs explanation,&#xD;
which, for the sake of brevity, w~. will&#xD;

It appears that a young man who was&#xD;
engaged as a clerk ix~ one of the fashion-&#xD;
able retail esLahlishments on Fourth&#xD;
street, had, like, many others, been&#xD;
drawn into one of, those "fashionable&#xD;
places of amusement," alias billiard&#xD;
saloons, and had imbibed a taste for&#xD;
gaming, which soon led him into other&#xD;
and more serious places of resort. Now,&#xD;
we do not wish to be understood' as&#xD;
emphatically condemning this kind of&#xD;
amusement, for the game of billiards, in&#xD;
itself is harmless and s~piple enough.'. In&#xD;
fact, it is so simple that we cannot for,&#xD;
the world determine why men of intelU-&#xD;
gence engage in it~, We would considerr&#xD;
it,~for our part, quitq73as creditable to sit&#xD;

speak candidly, why; can't our young&#xD;
men~ and old ones, too, establish some&#xD;
rational and healthy amusement? By&#xD;
using the necessary exertions, associa-&#xD;
tions might easily be for-roed, which&#xD;
would prove a source of great advantage&#xD;
as well as gratification to those who&#xD;
desire to avail themselves of such a&#xD;
privilege. We have, however, been&#xD;
guilty .of a digression, and must retnru.&#xD;
The young man of whom we. L~ve&#xD;
been'speaking, having been robbed (for&#xD;
we~ ~can use no nlilder teI~ni):'6f all he&#xD;
honestly possessed in thei ~~world, 'was&#xD;
tempted by a plan which the fiend of&#xD;
darkness whispered in his ear,' by which&#xD;
he might regain his losses. It was to&#xD;
rob his employers, and win back from&#xD;
his more fortunate~frien4s; that which,&#xD;
by some sudden change of luck, had been&#xD;
taken from him, Desperate as the deed&#xD;
seemed at first to be, he at last deter-&#xD;
mined to do it. At the hour of mid-&#xD;
night, while his confiding employ~~s and&#xD;
fellow clerks were asleep, h~ stole noise-&#xD;
lessly to the safe and extracted a small&#xD;
sum, so that its absence might not be&#xD;
so easily noticed, and oi~ce more returned&#xD;
to the gaming 'table; but, instead of r~-&#xD;
coveringwhat he hadlost, he squandered&#xD;
tl~at, for which he ha4 sacrificed his&#xD;
honor, and damned his soul forever.&#xD;
Tl~en his friends, who wer~ evidently&#xD;
solicitous forhis welfare, informed hi~&#xD;
that he had placed himself completelyy&#xD;

of' th'~ city, It is generally lOoked upon&#xD;
a~ a 'very qidet section, and, in conse-&#xD;

Like most of 'the Streets in the city, it is&#xD;

The queen O~ty, among her disadvan-&#xD;

ing a name indicative of its character,&#xD;
could not be otherwise, without a palpable&#xD;
display of inconsistency. But this, even,&#xD;
loses its distinction in a few squares, and&#xD;
is reduced to an equality with the others.&#xD;

convince~ any reasonable person that&#xD;
narrow streets, shut out from the light&#xD;
by five and six story buildings, are not&#xD;
by any means desirable, or 'conducive to&#xD;
health or comfort. An effort has been&#xD;
made Within the past few years to improve&#xD;
th&amp;amp; streets, by introducing bowiders&#xD;
taken from the bed of the Ohio river, in&#xD;

make a vastly mqre ~Iurable and smoother&#xD;
pavement than the broken stone; and&#xD;
were the streets rCgularl'y'~#e~t, as they&#xD;
are in sonic of the Eastern cities, during&#xD;
the night-a project less expensive than&#xD;
that of watering them-the difficulties&#xD;
would, to a great degreee, be obviated,&#xD;
and a resilience in' the Olty would be niade&#xD;
thereby much more desirable.&#xD;
With these remarks we return 5 our&#xD;
story.. The home of Mr~. Wilson was&#xD;
situated 'upon Kemble street, which we&#xD;
have before spoken of. Mrs. Wilson&#xD;
Was a~ widow who had seen much of&#xD;
sorrow, and who had long been "the&#xD;
victim of that much-dr~a'ded and fatal&#xD;
dishes~, ~nisumptio~, ~hieh'is daily car-&#xD;
rying th6usmids aw'ay in its resisifess&#xD;
course. BesidOs this, ~he had another,&#xD;
not tess to be feared ddversary-whieh&#xD;
seemed to cling to her with equal tenacity&#xD;
&#xD;
~poverty. Mr. Wilson had long strug-&#xD;
gled against the~ ~ll, but her time had&#xD;
Come, and she lay ~r~on hei death-bed.&#xD;
She had two ~hildtefl - a son and&#xD;
daughter. The son, 'who was named&#xD;
Thomas, ormorefamiliarly called" Tom,"&#xD;
Was a youth of nearly twenty yeats'.&#xD;
and beside being of a robust and hearty&#xD;
constitutkn, was possessed of a more than&#xD;
ordinary share of niental power, which&#xD;
only lacked proper cultivation, in order&#xD;
that it might develop itself. But Tom,&#xD;
like many others, had faults, had some&#xD;
of them very grievous ones in the bargain.&#xD;
Naturally of an ardent aud agreeable&#xD;
disposition, his inclinations often led him&#xD;
into habits that were contrary to what his&#xD;
better nature told him was right. In&#xD;
short, 4'om was all that a Cincinnati&#xD;
"fireman" could be-he loved all the&#xD;
pretty girls; he loved "dA~ machine;"&#xD;
and, more than all, he loved the "cray-&#xD;
thur," as an Irishman would say. With&#xD;
this latter single exception, who could&#xD;
blame him!-for if there was such a thing&#xD;
as a true heart, in every sense of the&#xD;
word, to be found in the bosom of man,&#xD;
then we might'truly say that Toni Wilson&#xD;
possessed it. Yet, although we said&#xD;
that Tom lovCd all the pretty ~girls, we&#xD;
did not intend to intimate that each&#xD;
shared equally his thought. Oh, no,&#xD;
'Porn had his "sweetheart," his "lady-&#xD;
lov~," and least the readei~ should get&#xD;
out of patience~ with us for keening him&#xD;
or her so long in suspense, we will just&#xD;
hint or intimate - no we wont! so&#xD;
exercise a little control over your curio-&#xD;
sity, and we promise you shall be in-&#xD;
formed in sufficient time. Adelaide, the&#xD;
daughter, waS at the time we speak of,&#xD;
near the age of fourteen years, and post&#xD;
messed a form as faultless as can be easily&#xD;
~sonceived, and as amiable and sWeet B&#xD;
dispssitien as e'er hecaine a beauty like&#xD;
&#xD;
hers. Adelaide was a good girl in every'&#xD;
sense of the word. Kind and generous~&#xD;
hearted, industrious and Intelligent, she:&#xD;
neVer kneW a friend but that they loved&#xD;
her. By her unceasing toil with the&#xD;
needle, she was enabled, now that ~her&#xD;
poor mother was sick and unable to&#xD;
labor, to procure a bare subsistence.&#xD;
Tom, owing to his dissipated habits, 1jtgs&#xD;
of little service to the others; but, to his&#xD;
credit be it said, if he was of no advan~&#xD;
tage, 'he did not make himself in any~&#xD;
respect a burden or disadvantage. tlis&#xD;
time was generally spent away from&#xD;
home, among his boon comrades. Yet&#xD;
he loved his mother and sister dearly,&#xD;
and often cursed the day that ho first&#xD;
was induced to touch the fatal wino CE~p&#xD;
which had made him so miserable and'&#xD;
worthleSS a person as he well knew he&#xD;
was. Yet the first step had been taken~&#xD;
and the others speedily follow~d. There&#xD;
was one thing that troubled the min4&#xD;
of Tom Wilson more' than' all others~&#xD;
This Was his' loVe affair. Tom, much&#xD;
as he loved his motherand sister, could&#xD;
not help nourishing a passion for one&#xD;
other person, and this had gained such&#xD;
a perfect cOntrol over him, that no place&#xD;
seemed to fill his soul 'with such inex-&#xD;
pressible feelings of happiness, as when&#xD;
in the presence of:his dearly beloved&#xD;
and daily worshiped sweetheart!'&#xD;
Yet Tom knew that he was doing&#xD;
wrong, and lived constantly in the fear&#xD;
that Sally ~- there~ we have said it!&#xD;
but never mind, since we have uninten~&#xD;
ti&amp;amp;nally "let the cat out of the wallet,"&#xD;
we will try no longer to hide her name&#xD;
fro~ our readers: so he' was constantly' is&#xD;

services. In order that our portrait may&#xD;
be more life-like, we will endeavor to&#xD;
give the reader a 4iew of this person as&#xD;
she really appears on the promenade.&#xD;
Let the reader imagine that she has left&#xD;
Broadway, and is walking in a westerly&#xD;
direction. Slowly she approaches the&#xD;
corner of Fourth and Sycamore-.-Post&#xD;
Office corner-wh~re quite a crowd 6f&#xD;
gentlemen are assembled, for it is near&#xD;
the hour of eleven o'clock, A. in., the&#xD;
hour for opening the eastern mail. Look&#xD;
at her now, as she passes the bonnet&#xD;
store, and turns half round, as though&#xD;
she intended to enter, or, perhaps, show&#xD;
herself in a graceful movement. Her&#xD;
little, fashionable bonnet, setting well&#xD;
back, to show as much of her hair and&#xD;
puffa as possible. How ruddy her face&#xD;
looks, and how exquisitely' white' and&#xD;
pearl-like her regular teeth! Her head&#xD;
thrown back, and.her splendid sun-shade&#xD;
unopened in her hand, is in perfect con-&#xD;
cert with her graceful figure.. 'She has&#xD;
no occasion to hurry, and hence she&#xD;
takes her own time-walks slowly. Her&#xD;
beautiful, languid ~ye detects several&#xD;
well-known worthies, said to' be wealthy&#xD;
and in search of lovely women for wives.&#xD;
Slowly, as she approaches the. edge of&#xD;
the curbstone, on Sycamore, where she&#xD;
must eres', her tightly gloved hand&#xD;
descends, falls amid the folds of her&#xD;
dress: she seizes her skirts in front, and&#xD;

The same thing is done at Maui, anA&#xD;
Walnut, and Vine. She turns around&#xD;
and retraces her steps-i--now ho1din~' her&#xD;

It is longer, you see, by three inches,&#xD;
than her mother ever wore a dress; and&#xD;
this ~reat length of the TAIL iS her excuse&#xD;
for lifting it so high. Look! now she&#xD;

us from doing what we consider to be&#xD;

measures have been taken, to bring such&#xD;
an event about. A glance at one morn-&#xD;
ing's report of the proceedings in our&#xD;

who is at all skeptical on the subject of&#xD;
crime in the %~ueen City. New York&#xD;

dreaded resorts of crime by a missionary&#xD;

known that there are some dens of infamy&#xD;
in this city which will challenge any&#xD;
other city in the United States to produce&#xD;
an equal. Let the press speak out freely&#xD;
upon the subject, and we may expect ~&#xD;
favorable response from the people.&#xD;

Suddenly a bright gla~e~ 'preceded by&#xD;
a dense ~ro1ume of heavy, dark smoke6&#xD;
is seen, which is, followed in turn by a&#xD;
sound of cracking flames, and a. noise&#xD;
resembling much the distant sound of&#xD;
thunder. 'Soon shouts and screams are&#xD;
heard, and fro~n a number of low, black,&#xD;
ened habitations, situated on a small and&#xD;
unimportant street in the confines of the&#xD;
Eighth Ward, rush fortri a strange £n~d1ey&#xD;
of half dressed, miserable Io6king'beings,&#xD;
who' hayc suddenly been aroused from&#xD;
their couches by the alarming intelligence&#xD;
that the buildings in which .they live are&#xD;
wrapped in flames.&#xD;
At this moment ~t thundering shout&#xD;
from the assembled crowd ~nnouncos&#xD;
that the' engines are at~ hand. A very&#xD;
brief time is occupied in getting ready to&#xD;
play upon the burning buildings, the fire&#xD;
in which is discovered to have made&#xD;
such headway that it is impossible to&#xD;
save them, and their exertions are con-&#xD;
fined to preserving those immediately&#xD;
surrounding them.&#xD;
Among those who had the honor of&#xD;
manning the "first engine on the ground,"&#xD;
is a young fellow, possessing a flue form&#xD;
an4 regular features, who seems to be&#xD;
one of the most energetic of the company.&#xD;
Hatless and costless he stood up~~.a&#xD;
portion of the fallen building, and directed&#xD;
a pipe which seemed to do good execution,&#xD;
driving back the' angry~ flames that at&#xD;
each mome~nt'burst forth ahew from s&amp;amp;ne&#xD;
p~urt'of the burning tile.&#xD;

prey to a villain's snares. Oh! how he&#xD;

nature was changed ; lie was a difl'enent&#xD;

he swore an oath to he terribly avenged&#xD;

The girl crossed the room, and opened&#xD;

There was b~it little alteration observe~&#xD;

Pembroke, save that his features were&#xD;
somewhat flushed with protracted dissi-&#xD;

niarked with the same plar~sibility as of&#xD;

At the moment of his entrance, a' gen~&#xD;

"Hell and furies 1" shouted Gus,&#xD;

"Exabtly so," answered 'Pembroke;&#xD;
"and, moreover, sh~ is determined to&#xD;

Gus, for a few moments, did not speak,&#xD;
but strode rapidly' to and fro across the&#xD;
apartment, like one laboring under a fit&#xD;
of insanity. His strong fram~swelled&#xD;
~nd trembled with inward emotions,&#xD;
whjle his brow':was o'ercast~. with a frown&#xD;
as dark ds midnight. Gus was a person&#xD;
who exei~cised but little control over his&#xD;
darker passions, having ever allowed&#xD;
them an entire sway' ~ver his actions.&#xD;
At times he was m&amp;amp;ose and gloomy;&#xD;
and in these moods, no one who knew&#xD;
him cared to cross him. In his' calm&#xD;
moments he was extremely gay and&#xD;
jovial, and nowhere could be found a&#xD;
more agreeable companion than he. In&#xD;
shoi't his life~w&amp;amp;s a mystery - and one&#xD;
which his most intimate companions were&#xD;
unacquainted 'with. After pacing the&#xD;
apartment for some time in silence, until&#xD;
he accrued to have somewhat regained&#xD;
his accustomed .composure, he paused&#xD;
before young Pembroke, and said in a&#xD;
'deep tone of voice&#xD;
"Char1ey~ this girl must be silenced 1"&#xD;
"So I have been thinking," replied&#xD;
the other, "but h9w 'is it to be done?&#xD;
She is fully bent upon foiling our efforts,&#xD;
apd . unless active measures are imme-&#xD;
diately taken, she 'will succeed. A word&#xD;

ITS MYSTERIES AND MISERIES.            79&#xD;
&#xD;
"You are right-we must act at once.&#xD;
For know, Charley, that I love the' gentle'&#xD;
Eleanor as never before have I loved a&#xD;
woman, for ~he is everything that is&#xD;
pure and noble. Beside this, she has a&#xD;
princely fortune, which, by my marriage,&#xD;
will fall into my hands. I believe, my&#xD;
boy, that if I should succeed in this in-&#xD;
stance, I would quit my present habits,&#xD;
and endeavor to become a respectable&#xD;
ornament to society. What say you9"&#xD;
"Well, it is all right enough for that&#xD;
matter; as I do not believe that' a little&#xD;
reformation at present could harm either&#xD;
of us a great deal. But of this girl; what&#xD;
do you intend to do ?"&#xD;
"Why, as I said before, she must be&#xD;
silenced. in some way or other, but I&#xD;
cannot immediately determine how. I&#xD;
wish you, after this, to keep a close&#xD;
watch upon her actions, and if you find&#xD;
that she really intends what she has said,&#xD;
you can inform me of it. She shall not&#xD;
stand in my way. If she drives me to&#xD;
desperation, the consequences rest upon&#xD;
her own head! Rather than relinquish&#xD;
my claim, upon the hand and fortune of&#xD;
Eleanor Henley. I would send her on a&#xD;
journey to that bourne from whence there&#xD;
is no return !"&#xD;
"You surely would not murder her 1"&#xD;
asked Pembroke, in a tone of astonish-&#xD;
ment, for he&#xD;
kne7 not thathis companion s&#xD;
character was so 'dark.&#xD;
"I would kill my own father, if he&#xD;
stood in my wa~ !" answered the gambler,&#xD;
in a tone that caused the blood of the&#xD;
young Virginian to curdle in his veins.&#xD;
Theil seeming to recollect the words he&#xD;
had made use ~f, he added, "Excuse&#xD;
my language, Chancy; I am' so much&#xD;
excited that I scarcely know the. words&#xD;
I utter. As I have urgent business&#xD;
out. in the city ~this evez~ing~ I musts&#xD;
leave you. Do n6t forget to act as I&#xD;
&#xD;
have advised,, and your services shall be&#xD;
liberally rewarded."&#xD;
With this; the handsome gambler bade&#xD;
his friend good morning, and, hastily~&#xD;
made' his way to the 'street.&#xD;
Pausing for a mQnlent on the steps of:&#xD;
the:hotel, as if to determine what course&#xD;
to 'pursue, he drew forth axi elegant&#xD;

what from our subject, and must return.&#xD;
The question may be asked, if we&#xD;
would.pretend to declare the American&#xD;
press a free press? To this we answer:&#xD;
no, by no means. In a previous article&#xD;
upon this subject, we have shown, abun-&#xD;
dantly, that it was corrupt enough. But&#xD;
how-~.--in what way? it may be asked.&#xD;
This age may be termed the age of&#xD;
gold, and slavish are the devotees to the&#xD;
glittering metal. Speculation reigns su-&#xD;
preme in America, and hence the activity&#xD;
which is everywhere manifesting itself.&#xD;
The nation is in a ferment of excitement&#xD;
on the subject of gain. The all-absorb-&#xD;
ing object of exertion now, and here, is&#xD;
money. Wealth and respectability are,&#xD;
in the estimation of many, inseparable&#xD;
linked together, and~without the former&#xD;
the latter cannot exist. To secure wealth,&#xD;
every species of traffic is resorted to,&#xD;
until even truth itself is weighed in the&#xD;
balance with gold. No wonder, then,&#xD;
that newspaper editors and companies&#xD;
sell the right of private judgment, and&#xD;
eater to popular sentiment. A, B, or C,&#xD;
though known villains, by a few dollars&#xD;
can command the columns of newspa-&#xD;
pers, and thus force themselves on the&#xD;
community as paragons of virtue and&#xD;
excellence. Selfishness dictates' nore&#xD;
than half the editorials written, and&#xD;
'seven-eighths of every newspaper we&#xD;
chance to get hold of is occupied with&#xD;

advertisements, or puffs of advertisers9&#xD;
For twenty cents a line, groggeries,&#xD;
gambling saloons, oyster cellars, thea.~&#xD;
ters, etc., can be puffed to their heart's&#xD;
content. This is the degradation of the&#xD;
press. Many newspapers have mottoes&#xD;
or declarations setting forth their object&#xD;
to be~ the diffusion of useful and Chris-'&#xD;
tian knowledge, and political informs..&#xD;
tion; but which, in reality, are mere&#xD;
mercantile bulletins, from the columns&#xD;
of which little more is to be learned than&#xD;
reading signs in the streets.&#xD;
No country~ on earth, laboring undei~&#xD;
our disadvantages, has a press as free&#xD;
as our own; but, since it is unwise to&#xD;
tolerate less than the best, where the&#xD;
best may be bad, why can we not have&#xD;
a press conducted by men. capable of~&#xD;
writing' sensible articles for general pe-&#xD;
b&#xD;
rusal, in place of flooding the county&#xD;
with badly printed newspapers, contain-&#xD;
ing worse written articles, or filled up&#xD;
with advertisements? The great object&#xD;
in newspaper publications is the acquisi-&#xD;
tion of money, and if this be accom-&#xD;
plished, all is well. If the three t'iiou~&#xD;
sand papers now published in the United&#xD;
States, would devote, each week, one of&#xD;
their papers to conveying to the peoplethe&#xD;
rudiments of popular education, for one&#xD;
year, a vast amount of good would be&#xD;
done that will never be effected by the&#xD;
course now pursued. Let any compe-&#xD;
tent editor, for one year, devote even&#xD;
one column to the geography of 'the&#xD;
United States, and, in less than half th'e&#xD;
time,' he will find himself surrounded&#xD;
with a far more' enlightened community&#xD;
than is usually found.&#xD;
Would it not be far better if some of&#xD;
our Cincinnati sheets would devote more&#xD;
of their space to the cause of dducatiwt&#xD;
and general intelligence, than to elabo'-&#xD;

A yaw evenings subsequent to the one&#xD;
'upon~ which the interview between Gus&#xD;
and the fortune-teller took place, as inti-&#xD;
wated at' the' close of our sixteenth&#xD;
chapter, the latter named individual paid&#xD;
~ visit to 'the apartments of Agnes Mer-&#xD;

coldly, for 'her presence was fai', from&#xD;

to diseoucert l~tadam ~.' i~ the least,&#xD;
&#xD;
for she was bent upon a mission of her&#xD;
own, and cared but little about the' good&#xD;
opinion and friendship of others, if her&#xD;
own plans were~ forwarded. For Some&#xD;
time her efforts to 'gain the attention of&#xD;
the~ girl were ineffectual; but, at last, by&#xD;
intimating that she was, through the&#xD;
medium of her "art," acquainted with&#xD;
the, circurn stances by 'which the othex'&#xD;
was surrounded, they were crowned with&#xD;
success.&#xD;
Agnes was led 'to believe that if sh~&#xD;
could secure the aid of Madam E., in&#xD;
her' cause, her plans might be more&#xD;
easily consummated. The fortune-teller&#xD;
affected to be much interested in the&#xD;
welfare of the girl, and freely promised&#xD;
all the ~assistance that lay in her power,&#xD;
and revealed to her many traits inth~&#xD;
character of her betrayer with which shc~&#xD;
was previously unacquainted. At thc&#xD;
same time, she disclosed numerous in-&#xD;
cidents of a private' character, which had&#xD;
taken place during the intimacy of Agnes&#xD;
and her pretended lover, that could not&#xD;
have been known to a' third person&#xD;
unless 'with the consent of one 'of the&#xD;
parties.&#xD;
Agnes was astonished and confounded&#xD;
by the words of the other, and easily&#xD;
became convinced that the fortune-teller&#xD;
was endowed with a power~ supernatural.&#xD;
She did not for a moment suspect that&#xD;
the woman might be an accomplice of&#xD;
her betrayer, and by him furnished&#xD;
with the information that enabled her to&#xD;
make the revelations which filled, her&#xD;
with such feelings of wonder and aston-&#xD;
ishment. She thought only of her plans&#xD;
of vengeance-and, being blind to every.&#xD;
thing else, it is not to be surprised at,&#xD;
that she should fall easily into the snare&#xD;
laid by the' other.&#xD;

This appeal was made by a~ f~tlom,&#xD;
ragged creature, who encountered a young&#xD;
man near the crossing of. Fourth and&#xD;
Sycamore, on the evening subsequent to&#xD;
the events we have just'~e1ated.&#xD;
The one addressed paused, and' aftei&#xD;
gazing at the. applicants moment, replied,&#xD;
as h~ ~jected a quantity Qf tobacco juice&#xD;
at the nearest lamp-post~&#xD;
"So yer want more moneyAo get 'tight'&#xD;
on, do yer? I should calculate you had&#xD;
more licker in yer. spirit-room r~ow than&#xD;
you could navigate with comfortably."&#xD;
"No-no - I must have something&#xD;
to steady my nerves, ors I shall perish,"&#xD;
answered the other in a husky, tone of&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"Poor feller 1" said the. young man&#xD;
compassionately, "you do seem to be in&#xD;
a bad fix. But don't you Think;that a&#xD;
cup~of hot'coffee and.a wiWm~ beefsteak&#xD;
wonid do you more good'? I'll treat y~r&#xD;
to that, for I don't like~to~see~e~ poor fel-&#xD;
ler starve,~wheni've got ~a 'ied 'in my&#xD;
pocket." "&#xD;
"Anything: I care net ~what it is, so&#xD;
that it will quench this burning thirst,"&#xD;
and he pressed his hand upon his bosom.&#xD;
"Well, then, come 'long'with me~o~ver&#xD;
to:the 'Boston,' for they do things up in&#xD;
the right kind of style there, I tell you.&#xD;
I always eats at the 'Boston,' 'cause&#xD;
Fales is a gentleman, and no mistake."&#xD;
Nothing further was said 'by either,&#xD;
and they soon entered the testaursnt&#xD;
spoken of, and took a seat at olie of 4he&#xD;
tables. Then for the first time each, had&#xD;
a fair look at the other's features. The&#xD;
next moment the beggar exclaimed with&#xD;
startling emphasis,&#xD;
9 Tom-~-Toxu Wilson-is itsyou ?"&#xD;
The one spoke to started as the. tones&#xD;
of the others' voice fell upon his ear, and&#xD;
bending over the table, he gazed for a few&#xD;
moments in silence into the other's face.&#xD;

Kind reader, a few words more by way of&#xD;
explanation, and our story will cl9se.&#xD;
With the sanction of Mr. ~enley,'the' plot&#xD;
of the~libertine and gambler, Gus Williams, in'&#xD;
respect to the secret marriage referred to in a&#xD;
previous chapter, was consummated. As the&#xD;
bridal party were about t~ issue from, the~&#xD;
church wheie the ceremonyhndbe~n perforr~ccd,&#xD;
they were 'suddenly confronted j~y Tiiuu WW&#xD;
son and a posse of the city.pol~b~e. 'Pembroke,&#xD;
who was one of the former mentioned party,&#xD;
upon recognizing the yopig fireman, turned~&#xD;
and would have fled; but T~m bounded upon&#xD;
him with the fury of a inadmau, au4 hurled,&#xD;
him to the floor. The next 'instant his knees&#xD;
were. on the other's breast, and whi)e iris hand&#xD;
clenched his throat, he whispered~the nan~e of&#xD;
Adelaide between his teeth, and tightpned his&#xD;
giasp. A gasp - a shudder - and Charles,&#xD;
embroke, the gambler, the libertine, wa~ no&#xD;
more -The brother had avenged, his sister s&#xD;
wrong!&#xD;
Gus would have interfered to say~ his friend,&#xD;
but as lie started forward, for that purpose, the&#xD;
heavy hand of one of the officers of justice&#xD;
was placed upon his shouldel-, and, he, was&#xD;
informed ,that he must consider. himself a&#xD;
prisoner..&#xD;
'The astoxiishnxent and chagrin of Mr. Hen.&#xD;
by and his daughter can better be imagined&#xD;
titan described,' when they learned that Sir&#xD;
George Cleveland, Bart., was an imposter.-.---&#xD;
DaJ gold hasthe ability to seal as well as to&#xD;
&#xD;
loosen the tongue; so Mr. Henley experienced&#xD;
but little difficulty in hushing the matter up.&#xD;
At his request, the false baronet was permit-&#xD;
ted to 'go free, as be 'dared not allow a pub-&#xD;
lic examination to take place that would result&#xD;
in~ the disclosure of his shame. This was,&#xD;
however, with the provision that the gambler&#xD;
should immediately quit the City.&#xD;
Agnes Merton, on the night of her brother's&#xD;
death, was taken byTom Wilson to the house&#xD;
of Mr. Dawson, where, she was kindly eared&#xD;
for by the warm-hearted Sarah. But, alas I&#xD;
the destroyer had done his work-sIte was a&#xD;
~aving maniac!'&#xD;
'The infamous Madam B., the cause of this&#xD;
horrid affair, effected her escape 'from the pun-&#xD;
ishment' her crimes so richly merited, and it is&#xD;
paid fled to the Empire City, where a wider&#xD;
field was probably offered for the exercise ef&#xD;
her peculiar talents I&#xD;
Is it necessary for us to tell you how Tom&#xD;
Wilson, the gallant young fireman, wedded the&#xD;
,maiden of his first and only choice-the ami-&#xD;
able and beautiful Sarah Dawson? Scarcely;&#xD;
for if you will take the'pains tovisit a certain&#xD;
little ~ottsge that stands near a certain railroad'&#xD;
some thirty or forty miles from thd city; and&#xD;
look upon a 'fond mother, a happy father, and&#xD;
a prnttIing~ crowing little "cherub," who an-&#xD;
swers to the name of Tom, Jr., you will be&#xD;
convinced sooner than l~y words, 'that, in the&#xD;
classic language of the illustrious Sam Patch,&#xD;
"some things can be done as well as others."&#xD;
Tom, our Tom, has left the city-the scene&#xD;
of his many trials and triumphs, joys and sor-&#xD;
rows-has given up "der machine," and be-&#xD;
come one of." nature'ti noblemeub" Long may&#xD;
he wave I&#xD;
TIre fate of Gus Williams is as yet en--&#xD;
shrouded in mystery ; 'but we may hereafter&#xD;
undertake to trace his singular and eventful&#xD;
i~areer to its finale, if it is the desire of our&#xD;
kind frieRds who have accompanied us thus&#xD;
far for us to do so.&#xD;
Reader; the last "length" of our drama of&#xD;
real life has been spoken-the protupter has&#xD;
left his box-the disposition is completed-the&#xD;
bell rings, and the green curtain descends to&#xD;
slow, music. ,~l~hat health and prosperity may'&#xD;
~ttend you nll during the journey of life, is&#xD;
~ur fervent wish at'parting. Good-by.'&#xD;

UPPER TEN AND LOWER DLILLION.&#xD;
BY GEORGE LIPP~&amp;amp;RD.&#xD;
Author of "Washington and his 0enerai4;" ~" fl10 KaZBThflB " "Paul Ardenheim ;"&#xD;
"Jesus and the ?oor;" "Adonal," etc.&#xD;
Weans shall we find an appropriate symbo!~ of New Y~*,-a symboVtllat compressee N~w York, its&#xD;
terrible contrasts of wealth mid poverty, luxury awl nilsery into a toeus5 and presents In Qfle 4ivid view a&#xD;
condensed picture of the Great City at it Is?&#xD;
(lo up Wall Street on a aues$ilay~y. ArQund you, heave the waves of New Yorklife,.-rascallty, specu-&#xD;
lation, wealth, beggary, misew~', crime~-a'~d at the heed of Wall street, ~,almly contemplating the scene, situ&#xD;
Trinity Church, in het gsrmtnt of drab stone, with her high head-dress' and a golden gross on her head.&#xD;
Trinity Church; nilycoatesaplating Wal1~treet, is the sytebol of dOW ~crlt life. There is the Church&#xD;
and high up In the air shines the cross of the Redeemer,-this certainly looks like religion, even if it is noL&#xD;
religion-hut beneath that cross, serenely shining in upper sir, and glittering always in sunset, sunrise,&#xD;
noonday moonlight, or In the lightning's glare, rolls and heaves the awful current of New York life, sning.&#xD;
ling wealth that cannot be~counted with misery that has n~ lower depth; mingling, In aword, virtue and&#xD;
crime, velvet and rage, ban~ers Mid mechanics, stpck speculators and watch stu~fers, grave iden of business&#xD;
and men who have ntitber business, work, nor bread,-abd this tid&amp;amp;of life is ~xever stilL All day long it&#xD;
whirls and rolls there. All day long, Trinity Church looks quietly on, as if saying, "Go ahead, good people,&#xD;
rich and poor, honest men .an4 gog~cesI There are two religions in this world-the week-day religion and&#xD;
the Sunday religion. "I, brown sandstone, gothio-foliaged old Trinity reprtsez~ the Sunday religion, with its&#xD;
fine carriages and sleek broadcloth, 'while good people of Wall street are doing the week-day religion. Go&#xD;
ahead It Is well that we should thus stand'fitce to face, so that all the world' may know, that however we&#xD;
differ in externals, both Trinity Church and Wall street, whatever we may say or do, believe or disbelieve,&#xD;
have at our hearts, one common, holy belief-in THE POLLAlt."&#xD;
In fact, Trinity Church at the head of Wall street, Is the eloquekit Preacher of New York, beating all the&#xD;
Deechers, Chapins, acid Deweys that the world ever saw.&#xD;
And the contrast presented by Trinity Church gazing on Wall street, does not end with Trinity Church&#xD;
and Wall street.' It is the same all over New York. Here, the splendid marble pli~ 9f Stewart's or the St.&#xD;
Nicholas hotel; there, Plve Points; in the carriage that whirls along Broadway, a rich man's daughter,&#xD;
wrapped in a $1000 shawl, and on the sidewalk, a courtesan of thirteen years, condemned to damn body and&#xD;
soul for bread, before her life has ripened beyond childhoods These are hard .~ontrest~, but these contrasts&#xD;
are New York.&#xD;
The plot of this work hinges upon the division of an estate which, In the course of twenty years, swells&#xD;
from two millions to one hundred millions of dollars, In this work the author has endeavored to picture,&#xD;
faithfully, some few of the Upper Ten Thousand and the Lower Million of the great city of New York.&#xD;
It has been the object of the author to picture New York suit is, by picturing not only its present, but its&#xD;
floating population-grouping together characters froik theilld World, and from all parts of the Union. How&#xD;
well he has succeeded in his work, the public best can.judge.&#xD;

From the Cievelauad Plaiss ,Peaier..-"Ncio Yo~*; Ru t7j~per lbs and Loue~- Aftution.-&#xD;
Messrs. Ii. Mendenball &amp;amp; Co., of Cincinnati, have laid on our table a copy of a new work, by that gifted son&#xD;
of genius, George Lippard. We have read It. It is a novel of most.thrilllng'interest-sueh a olta as, having&#xD;
been commenced, you will sit up all night to finish. 'New York' has less of those features of Style which&#xD;
some have deemed objectionable. Mr. Lippard's style always was, and ever will be, original, and for that&#xD;
reason (if for nothing else) we are always bound to admire it.&#xD;
"Take It all in all, it is a book we would like everybody to read. It Is the work ofgenlus, and the emana-&#xD;
tion of a heart keenly alive to the wrongs and outrages the 'superstitlOki of gold' imposes on nine-tenths of&#xD;
the human race.'~&#xD;
From the Louisville Courier.-'UVlso York; Ru Tipper lbs a~4 LowerMilhion.-George Lip.&#xD;
pard's last and best work. This novel requires only to be read to be correctly appreciated. As an enchant-&#xD;

leave It oil until he bee turned over Its last page."&#xD;

commencilment' to the end. Those *ho hart read Dumas' Count de M6nte Christo, or theWan~lering Jew,&#xD;

From the Times.-"George Lippard's great work-New YOrk; Ru' l7pper lbs tind Lower Million.-...&#xD;
Novel readers will be perfectly delighted with this work. The incidents delineated in this work are of the&#xD;
