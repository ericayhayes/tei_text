THE YOUNG FISHERMAN.&#xD;

channel. From the terrace of the castle one&#xD;
could toss a. penny into the chimney-tops of twor&#xD;
or three of the nearest cottages, though the t&#xD;
dwellings were generally some distance apart,e&#xD;
following the windings of a street around these&#xD;
curving shore of the cove. There was an air ofs&#xD;
neatness and thrift about most of the habita-&#xD;
tions, each having a small garden patch and a&#xD;
yard in front wherein to dry their nets and fish.&#xD;
If there was any superiority in the appearances&#xD;
of either of these cabins over the other, it was toI&#xD;
be claimed by one which stood near the foot of&#xD;
the cliff, and close to the path which wound&#xD;
from the beach to its summit. This superiority&#xD;
consisted in its being whitewashed, and in hav-&#xD;
ing vines growing over the narrow doorway in&#xD;
imitation of an arch, beneath which were two&#xD;
wooden benches, from which, persons seated&#xD;
upon them had a pleasant view of the channel&#xD;
with its moving craft. .That spot, also, wherein&#xD;
the other fishermen dried their nets, was by the&#xD;
proprietor of this abode made a flower-garden,&#xD;
while on the surrounding rocks were spread his&#xD;
nets and sun-dried fish.&#xD;
One evening in'May, in the year 1650, about&#xD;
half'an hour before sunset, a fishing boat came&#xD;
sailing into the cove from the channel, and&#xD;
steered directly for the rude landing in front of&#xD;
the cottage we have described. Its bow was&#xD;
shattered, and it was evidently leaking freely,&#xD;
and kept from sinking only by the extraordinary&#xD;
exertions .of a young fisherman, who was its sole&#xD;
occupant, and who was bailing out water con-&#xD;
stantly as he approached the shore. At length&#xD;
the smack touched the beach, and with an ex-&#xD;
clamation of satisfaction the young man leaped&#xD;
on shore.&#xD;
The danger in which the boat had been was&#xD;
apparent to more than one. in the village, and&#xD;
encouraging shouts had been sent to the young&#xD;
man's ear, to keep up his strength and not lose&#xD;
his- courage. Therefore, on reaching the land in&#xD;
safety, he found him~eItin the midst of some&#xD;
score of a group, composed of the fishers' wives,&#xD;
of maidens, and of such old men as had given&#xD;
over active service. They looked at- the shat-&#xD;
tered bow of the boat with surprise, and while-&#xD;
some congratulated him with having got safely&#xD;
to land, others eagerly inquired how he had got&#xD;
so badly wrecked.                 .&#xD;
"It is of no consequence, friends," answered&#xD;
the young map, as he secured the boat to oso of&#xD;
the posts of the pier, " accidents will happen at&#xD;
sea, you know."&#xD;
"&#xD;
&#xD;
This was said with a pleasant laugh; but his&#xD;
mother, who drew near to welcome -him after&#xD;
the danger she conceived he had been in from&#xD;
drowning-for he had been seen by her a league&#xD;
at sea, struggling to save his boat, which he had&#xD;
so gallantly brought in-knew that the smile&#xD;
was forced and unnatural to his usually frank&#xD;
and open face.&#xD;
"There is something'in this," she said, shak-&#xD;
ing her head and turning to two of her particu-&#xD;
lar gossips, " there is something in this matter&#xD;
more than Guilford sees fit to tell."&#xD;
The young man, having secured the craft high&#xD;
up on the beach and furled the sails, shouldered&#xD;
a pair of oars, and with a flushed brow, and a&#xD;
proud, defiant air, strode up towards the cottage,&#xD;
without regarding his friends, whom he left ex-&#xD;
amining the boat and wondering how it could&#xD;
have been so shattered unless it had been run&#xD;
into.&#xD;
" That is it," asserted an old fisherman, who&#xD;
had carefully examined the broken shearing&#xD;
"she ha' been run into, an' by a heavier craft&#xD;
than hersel'."&#xD;
The young fisherman, having deposited his&#xD;
oars in the becket above one of the cottage win-&#xD;
dows, on the .outside of the house, instead of&#xD;
going in, began to pace up and down in the lit-&#xD;
tle shell-covered walk before it. His eyes were&#xD;
restless and fiery, his attitude erect and warlike,&#xD;
and his heavy step seemed to fall to the sound&#xD;
of a trumpet. Something evidently had occurred&#xD;
to rouse in the bosom of the young fisherman all&#xD;
the pride, independence, and haughty resent-&#xD;
ment of the man;' for beneath the fustian jacket&#xD;
may beat as much pride and sense of honor as&#xD;
beneath the ermine of a born noble.&#xD;
The appearance of the young fisherman was&#xD;
superior to that of young men of his class and&#xD;
occupation. This superiority did not consist in&#xD;
dress, for his clothing was as coarse and rude as&#xD;
that of any of his fellows; nor in the symmetry&#xD;
of his person, for there were in the hamlet as&#xD;
well shaped young men as he ; but it was in the&#xD;
noble expression of his whole form and face.&#xD;
He looked like one born rather to command&#xD;
those with whom he daily associated, than to be&#xD;
merely their equal. This innate power in him&#xD;
they recognized, though it was never demanded&#xD;
by him, for he seemed wholly unconscious of a&#xD;
superiority of which all others in the hamlet&#xD;
were instinctively conscious. His face was&#xD;
handsome, and perhaps'not less so for being&#xD;
browned by the sea winds till it was almost as&#xD;
&#xD;
L&#xD;
&#xD;
S , i'&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE YOUNG FISHERMAN&#xD;
&#xD;
dark as the Arabian. His eyes were black, and&#xD;
filled with intelligence and courage. As a sea-&#xD;
man he had no equal on the Sussex coast, of&#xD;
his age, all men acknowledged. As a fisherman&#xD;
he was skilled in the craft, in all its details, so&#xD;
that no one ever surpassed him in success. If&#xD;
other boats came back empty, Guilford Gra-&#xD;
ham's was sure to contain some fruits of his&#xD;
skill and patience. In trials of strength and&#xD;
agility in those holiday sports which the youths&#xD;
of the hamlet used to indulge in, challenging to&#xD;
competition some inland village, he always&#xD;
came off victor. For filial obedience in support-&#xD;
ing a widowed mother, for manly protection of&#xD;
his beautiful cousin, Anne Graham, for his fast&#xD;
abiding as a friend, and his reverence for holy&#xD;
things, Guilford was an example to all the&#xD;
young men on the coast. His popular manners,&#xD;
his constant cheerfulness and good nature, made&#xD;
him a general favorite; and many a pretty&#xD;
maiden sighed in her heart for the love of the&#xD;
handsome Guilford.&#xD;
"What aileth thee, my son ?" asked his moth-&#xD;
er. " Something hath gone across thy temper,&#xD;
and made thee vexed,--tell me what is'the mat-&#xD;
ter with thee ?"&#xD;
He stopped in his fierce walk, turned, and&#xD;
taking both her hands in his, he pressed them&#xD;
with. affectionate respect, and looking her in the&#xD;
&#xD;
face, would have spoken; but some strong emo&#xD;
tion rising, checked his utterance, and tears&#xD;
filled his eyes and ran down his cheeks. He re-&#xD;
leased her hands, dashed the glittering drops&#xD;
from his face, and would have walked away,&#xD;
when she gently held him.&#xD;
"Nay, Guilford, you must come and sit down&#xD;
in the porch and tell me what has happened.&#xD;
Tears in my brave boy's eyes! Ah, something&#xD;
heavy has pressed upon thy soul this day, to&#xD;
force tears from thee I"&#xD;
" Come and sit down, mother, and I will tell&#xD;
thee," he said, after a moment's internal struggle.&#xD;
" You are wise and discreet, and may be able to&#xD;
advise me, But you will not despise me when&#xD;
you shall know all my rash folly ?"&#xD;
"You must first prove to me that you have&#xD;
been rash or foolish, who were never known to&#xD;
be so," said his mother, who, though humble in&#xD;
station and poorly attired, seemed to be, as he&#xD;
had said, a wise and discreet woman ; being a&#xD;
person of that plain common sense, so much&#xD;
oftener found in low conditions of life, than in&#xD;
the more artificial circles of society; and to her&#xD;
influence was owed, doubtless, his superiority,--&#xD;
for it is the woman that forms the character of&#xD;
the growing man, and her plastic hand leaves&#xD;
its impression on every moral outline.&#xD;

" TIE young nobleman," resumed Guilford,&#xD;
continuing his narrative to his mother, in the&#xD;
green embowered porch of the cottage, "stood&#xD;
for an instant regarding first one and then the&#xD;
other of us without a word. He then strode up&#xD;
and said haughtily:&#xD;
"' What and who are you that are so familiar&#xD;
as to hold converse with this lady, and with thy&#xD;
cap on, fellow?' With these words he struck off&#xD;
my cap to my feet, and one of his dogs taking it&#xD;
up, carried it off, tearing it with his teeth.&#xD;
"' Lord Wilmot, how can you be so rash!' ex-&#xD;
claimed Lady Catharine, with a mingled ex-&#xD;
pression of pain for me and anger against him.&#xD;
* This is the young man, Guilford Graham.'&#xD;
"' And who, pray, is Guilford Graham?' he&#xD;
repeated, sarcastically. ,&#xD;
"' Have you forgotten the name of the brave&#xD;
youth who, at the risk of his own life, saved&#xD;
mine?'&#xD;
"' How should one remember every hind's&#xD;
name ? So, young man, you are the clown that&#xD;
risked your life and broke the jaw of the best&#xD;
horse in my father's stud; for the horse came to&#xD;
the castle with his jaw broken as with a sledge-&#xD;
hammer, and we had to shoot him. You have&#xD;
a hand like Samson. But you did the thing&#xD;
well, though it cost a horse worth a thousand&#xD;
guineas.&#xD;
"'Brother, how can you speak of such a trifle,&#xD;
when my life was at stake?'&#xD;
"'Trne, but a discreet person should save one&#xD;
and not destroy the other. There, fellow, are&#xD;
four guineas! I dare swear thou hast not seen&#xD;
so much gold together before, and that it would&#xD;
&#xD;
take a year's fishing to give thee in hand the&#xD;
same amount.'&#xD;
" As he spoke, he threw the gold at my feet.&#xD;
I did not notice it. I had felt insulted by his&#xD;
manner as well as by his words, and by this act.&#xD;
I did not deign to glance towards him; but I&#xD;
looked in the face of Lady Catharine. Her eyes&#xD;
were alight with just resentment. She felt that&#xD;
I had been insulted, peasant as I was.'&#xD;
"'Wilmot, why do you reward courage in&#xD;
such a strange fashion ? One would fancy you&#xD;
had found in this young'man a foe, rather than&#xD;
one to whom you owe a debt of gratitude.'&#xD;
"' Gratitude to one like him!' answered the&#xD;
young Lord Vane, with a contemptuous glance&#xD;
at the coarse apparel of Guilford. 'I have paid&#xD;
him for his service in gold.. What fault can he&#xD;
find ? By the rood ! it would seem, from the&#xD;
familiar manner in which I found him holding&#xD;
converse with you, Kate, that he presumed more&#xD;
than becometh a hind. Fellow, get into thy&#xD;
boat and begone ; and think not, because chance&#xD;
hath made thee the mean instrument of saving&#xD;
a high bornlady's life, that thou hast gage there-&#xD;
from for speaking to her.'&#xD;
"'He did but offer to collect shells for me,&#xD;
brother,' said the Lady Catharine, reproachfully.&#xD;
'I called to him. He is in no ways to blame.'&#xD;
"' Then it is you who are to blame, to de-&#xD;
scend to speak to a youth like this, who will&#xD;
boast in the ale-houses among his fellows that&#xD;
he hath held tryst with Lady Kate Vane.'&#xD;
At these words, the eyes of the maiden flashed&#xD;
fire, but instantly filling with tears, she said :&#xD;
"'You are ungenerous, Rudolph.'&#xD;
&#xD;
" In the meanwhile," said Guilford, addressing wiser and better than others, it is to her sweet&#xD;

my. Instantly dame Graham, with that in-&#xD;
stinctive sense of propriety and self-possession&#xD;
which never forsook her, though she trembled in&#xD;
her inmost soul at beholding the shadows of&#xD;
these two men crossing her threshold, advanced&#xD;
and said civilly :&#xD;
" Enter, friends, and refresh yourselves. We&#xD;
were just at supper. If you will take seats, you&#xD;
shall cheerfully have whatever our poor larder&#xD;
can furnish."&#xD;
The soldiers sat down without ceremony, as if&#xD;
they felt perfectly at home, and were accustomed&#xD;
to the civility which they met with. One of them&#xD;
was a tall, thin, cadaverous man, with dark, an-&#xD;
gular brows, sallow cheeks, and straight black"&#xD;
hair for a beard, while that upon his head was&#xD;
cropped short like that of a modern convict. He&#xD;
was armed in a formidable manner, and was&#xD;
altogether a formidable looking person-a sort&#xD;
of cross between a puritan saint and a robber of&#xD;
the Rhine. His comrade was shorter by the&#xD;
head, girded full 'twenty inches more by the&#xD;
waist, had a bald bullet head, and no beard. His&#xD;
eyes were small and twinkling, and the corners&#xD;
of his mouth, which naturally were inclined to&#xD;
turn laughingly upwards, were drawn down in a&#xD;
sanctimonious curve, that each moment required&#xD;
his attention to keep so. The names of these&#xD;
two worthies were respectively "Strait-gate "&#xD;
and " Broad-way."   The first five minutes&#xD;
Strait-gate occupied in saying a long grace, to,&#xD;
which Broad-way responded an unctuous amen.&#xD;
They then fell to work upon the fish and ashes&#xD;
cakes before them; and having taken off the&#xD;
edge of their appetite, they began to use their&#xD;
eyes, now in scanning the room, then the face&#xD;
and dress of dame Graham, and lastly, but more&#xD;
lingeringly, the pretty countenance of Anne&#xD;
Grey, who sat aloof in the window, trying to&#xD;
withdraw as much from observation as she could.&#xD;
" So, dame, thou seemest to subsist by the&#xD;
travail of fishing ? Verily it is a gospel trade,&#xD;
and thou shouldst thrive. This comely maiden&#xD;
is thy daughter I do peradventure ?"&#xD;
This was spoken by Strait-gate.&#xD;
" My niece, your worship."&#xD;
" Come hither, maid, and let me see if thou&#xD;
art well favored," said Broad-way. " They do&#xD;
say -that much eating of fish doth improve the&#xD;
Complexion."&#xD;
But Anne, as soon as she saw that she was&#xD;
particularly noticed, tripped out of the cottage.&#xD;
" Verily and yea, the maiden hath fled. She&#xD;
hath no need to fear the soldiers of the Lora and&#xD;
&#xD;
FISHERMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
of Gideon. We war against kings, and not&#xD;
against women."&#xD;
"And how fares my Lord Cromwell, gentle-&#xD;
men ?"&#xD;
" Marry come up ! - How should - he but do&#xD;
well, who is next to king David in power, and&#xD;
Solomon in wisdom. Nevertheless, thou show-&#xD;
est thy reverence for him, good dame, by asking.&#xD;
Where is thy husband ?"&#xD;
"Dead, this seven years, sirs."&#xD;
1" Hast thou no man about ?" asked Broad-&#xD;
way, cocking his half-shut eye at the oars and&#xD;
sails that stood in the corner.&#xD;
"I have a son; a young man of four-and-'&#xD;
twenty."&#xD;
"Where is he, dame ?"&#xD;
" He has gone forth on some affairs of his&#xD;
own."&#xD;
" Very well; when he comes back we shall&#xD;
doubtless see him,-for by your leave, we will&#xD;
quarter with you a few days."&#xD;
" Such poor comforts as my humble roof&#xD;
affords are at your service," answered the dame,&#xD;
thankful that there were but two of them, when&#xD;
there might have been more.,&#xD;
After the men had well eaten, and quaffed&#xD;
strong waters from well filled flasks which they&#xD;
carried at their belts, they walked forth, saying&#xD;
they would ere long be back to stay for the&#xD;
night. They had not been five minutes depart-&#xD;
ed, when a man entered with the familiar air of&#xD;
a village gossip. He was dressed in a patched&#xD;
and, torn doublet,-hose down at the leg, a coarse&#xD;
tunic, and slouched hat. Moreover, his fiery-&#xD;
red nose showed that he was much given to ale-&#xD;
house potations.&#xD;
"Ah, dame, how be it all wi' ye ? How is the&#xD;
pretty lass Anne? Whpte is master Guilford ?&#xD;
Strange news come to, twn. Hope you haven't&#xD;
heard it first. Stirring times these--stirring,&#xD;
piping loot times ! Thank the Lord I was born&#xD;
in these stirring times !'&#xD;
With this the new comer rubbed his palms&#xD;
together, and spoke with great volubility, like a&#xD;
man over-earnest to be the first to turn the fasset&#xD;
of a barrel of news.&#xD;
"Why, what hath happened, Master Digby?"&#xD;
asked the dame.&#xD;

THE good dame then went to work to pre-&#xD;
pare some drink of ale and French brandy, which&#xD;
latter article the fishermen on the south coast,&#xD;
from their nearness to France, had always cheap-&#xD;
ly and in ample quantities in their households.&#xD;
Having made the potation hot, and seasoned it&#xD;
well with spices, she sent Anne with it to give&#xD;
it to their concealed guest, while she herself re-&#xD;
mnained to watch the entrance to the cottage&#xD;
that no one might come in unobserved. Anne,&#xD;
on entering the back apartment of the hut, care-&#xD;
fully closed and bolted the door between, and&#xD;
then drawing a rough table beneath the trap,&#xD;
she got upon it and knocked lightly with the end&#xD;
of a broom upon the ceiling above her head.&#xD;
" Sir cavalier ?" she said, softly.&#xD;
" What, maiden ?" asked the voice of the con-&#xD;
cealed fugitive, speaking through a crevice in&#xD;
the floor.&#xD;
" Open, and take this warm negus which my&#xD;
aunt hath prepared for thee. We know you&#xD;
must suffer from thirst and fatigue, for we have&#xD;
heard of the great y ardships the friends of Prince&#xD;
Charles have gone through to keep frpm being&#xD;
captured."&#xD;
The trap was carefully lifted, and the arm of&#xD;
the wanderer was thrust down for the flagon&#xD;
which the maiden reached up to him. As he&#xD;
took it he tapped her hand with his fingers, in&#xD;
token of his gratitude, and said in a voice ha-&#xD;
bitually subdued to the lowest undertone:&#xD;
" Thanks and blessings upon thee and thy&#xD;

"And who is thy cousin Guilford ?"'&#xD;
" The son of my aunt ; and though but a fish-&#xD;
erman's son, and himself a fisherman, he is a&#xD;
true friend to the prince, and lrays for his safe-&#xD;

" Thanks, thanks, maiden. This beverage&#xD;
will revive me and make me forget my day's&#xD;
fatigues."&#xD;
" Quick, sir cavalier, shut the trap down. I&#xD;
hear voices."&#xD;
The stranger immediately closed the boards&#xD;
and leaping t9 the floor from the table, the&#xD;
maiden removed it against the wall, and unbolt-&#xD;
ing the door returned to the front room. Voices&#xD;
of men in loud talk were still heard outside.&#xD;
" Didst give it to him ?" asked her aunt, in an&#xD;
under tone..&#xD;
" Yes, aunt, and he was so grateful, and so&#xD;
civil spoken; and his hand, as he reached it&#xD;
down, was as fair as a born lady's."&#xD;
" Without doubt; these court cavaliers do&#xD;

&#xD;
" One would not think, so, sir, to see you. I&#xD;
dare say you lost your hand in some battle ?"&#xD;
The brow of the stranger, naturally black, be-&#xD;
came suddenly dark as night. He was silent&#xD;
for ti few moments, and then answered in tones&#xD;
that thrilled the very heart's blood of the young&#xD;
fisherman:&#xD;
"No, sir-on the scaffold !"&#xD;
"On the scaffold !" repeated Guilford, with a&#xD;
start and a look that betrayed his surprise; and&#xD;
in his excitement he ceased rowing and regarded&#xD;
the stranger with a new and strange interest.&#xD;
"Do not cease to row, my young friend. I&#xD;
would gain a good sea-birth. Your eyes are&#xD;
sharp. Look, and tell me what you see in the&#xD;
south. I fancied I caught a flash of fire in that&#xD;
quarter, just west of the moon's path."&#xD;
&#xD;

this."&#xD;
"Nay, sir cavalier," answered Guilford, who&#xD;
each moment felt more drawn out to like the&#xD;
man whose life he had saved, and to confide in&#xD;
him, " it needs but little light for a lover to take&#xD;
his last adieu of his lady love."&#xD;
" What-is it so? It must be, from thy tones&#xD;
-and the tremor of thy lip. What, a quarrel ?"&#xD;
"No, my lord!1 Do not ask me more."&#xD;
"Nay, but thy happiness shall be in my keep-&#xD;
ing. Thou shalt tell me thy tale on board my&#xD;
ship. It may be I can serve thee where thou&#xD;

" Thanks, captain; but no one can aid me. It&#xD;

"I will judge of that when I have made thee&#xD;

ship. The captain had fascinated him,. and he  "I like him not well, my lord."&#xD;
felt that he should be content to unite his for- " Common report hath va tlat he hath a fair&#xD;

had a ship, a wish was born in Guilford's heart  x" She is very fair, my lord captain."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE YOUNG&#xD;
&#xD;
" Thou hast seen her, then ?"&#xD;
"Yes, my lord,'' answered Guilford, blushing,&#xD;
and both pleased and.annoyed at having Lady&#xD;
Catharine the subject of conversation. To him&#xD;
she was something consecrated to his most se-&#xD;
cret thoughts, and the idea of whom he could&#xD;
share with no one.,&#xD;
" She will be one of the proudest peeresses in&#xD;
the realm if the young king comes to the throne.&#xD;
Many a knight and noble, and I wot princes too,&#xD;
will be suing for her hand. But here we are,&#xD;
discovered and hailed."&#xD;
&#xD;
JunorG from the manner of the captain's&#xD;
reception on board of his ship, Guilford enter-&#xD;
tained the highest notions of his authority and&#xD;
popularity. The scene which the long, warlike&#xD;
decks presented to his eyes, lighted up by rows&#xD;
of battle lanterns, was novel and stirring to the&#xD;
blood. Three hundred men were arranged in&#xD;
orderly ranks to welcome their returned chief,&#xD;
and the red glare of the lanterns falling upon&#xD;
their features, lent to their countenances and pic-&#xD;
turesque costumes a romantic character that did&#xD;
not fail to impress the lively imagination of&#xD;
young Guilford. There were at least a dozen&#xD;
officers also assembled on the 'quarter' deck,&#xD;
some of them men with gray beards, others&#xD;
young and ardent. They were each and all&#xD;
handsomely attired in gold laced coats and rich&#xD;
chapeaux with plumes. The whole appearance&#xD;
of the ship, with its tiers of cannon, its crowds of&#xD;
fighting men, armed with long pistolets and cut-&#xD;
lasses, and its chivalrous looking group of off-&#xD;
cers, who all seemed gentlemen born, struck&#xD;
Guilford in the most favorable manner.&#xD;
While he was casting his eyes about him, and&#xD;
filling them with the new scenes thus suddenly&#xD;
opened before him, the captain, who was plainly&#xD;
dressed, and in travel worn costume, placed his&#xD;
hand on his shoulder and said to his offers:&#xD;
&#xD;
FISHERMAN.                            83&#xD;
Guilford's heart was swelling. Hope was&#xD;
dying in him at these last words of the captain.&#xD;
He felt that he was mad longer to think of her.&#xD;
He now saw more vividly than ever his rashness&#xD;
and folly. He, the poor fisher, to cope with&#xD;
knights, nobles and princes!I He felt like drop-&#xD;
ping into the deep, deep sea, and putting an end&#xD;
forever, thought he, to his wild hopes, his am-&#xD;
bitious madness, his despair, and all the future&#xD;
of misery which he now so plainly saw before&#xD;
him on earth.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Messieurs, to this young fisherman I owe my&#xD;
life. I was hotly pursued to the coast by a&#xD;
score of Cromwell's hounds, and this young man&#xD;
shot down the leading trooper and got me safely&#xD;
off in his boat. This is enough for me to say to&#xD;
place him on the proper footing with you all."&#xD;
At this, several of the officers advanced and&#xD;
shook Guilford by the hand, and especially the&#xD;
young men were enthusiastic is their congratula-&#xD;
tions. Guilford's feelings may be guessed at,&#xD;
but hardly described. His heart bounded with&#xD;
joy, for he felt that through this fair reception&#xD;
might be opened a way for his advancement.&#xD;
The captain now descended, or rather walked&#xD;
aft into his state-cabin, which was an elaborately&#xD;
carved house, built over the stern of the after&#xD;
twenty feet of the deck ; for like the ships of that&#xD;
period, the stern rose very loftily, so that a per-&#xD;
son standing upon the top of the poop, had his&#xD;
head very nearly on a level with the mizzen top.&#xD;
At the invitation of the captain, Guilford fol-&#xD;
lowed him into the first apartment-for there&#xD;
was a room within a room. Before the door of:&#xD;
the farthest state-room stood a sentry.&#xD;
"What, how is this ?" he asked of his first&#xD;
lieutenant, seeing the soldier.&#xD;
" My lord, here are the written reports of all&#xD;

and traitorous noble ? Shall I not hang thee ?"&#xD;
"For my sister's sake !" he gasped, as if he&#xD;
had caught a faint ray of hope.&#xD;
" Thy sister ! Ah, yes ; for her sake I would&#xD;
. do much, for I owe to her tears and eloquence&#xD;
with the stern, flinty Cromwell, my head. What&#xD;
of her?"&#xD;
"She is here ! Let her speak for me."&#xD;
"By the rood, she may speak for thy life and&#xD;
gain it ; but thou shalt lose thy right hand this&#xD;
night, as surely as there is justice on earth."&#xD;
"Mercy ! mercy-my lord!"&#xD;

"If thy sister pleads not for thy life, it is not&#xD;
worth a mavaredi to thee ; but thy right hand&#xD;
shall be cut off. I have sworn it."&#xD;
With a shriek, the craven noble fell down in a&#xD;
swoon his full length upon the floor.&#xD;
A voice from the inner cabin was now heard&#xD;
in earnest implorations. Guilford, who had&#xD;
already divined that Lady Catharine was the&#xD;
female who had been captured, with the yacht,&#xD;
now recognized the tones, and he darted impul-&#xD;
sively towards the door; but the sentry present-&#xD;
ed his cutlass, and held him back. He then ad-&#xD;
vanced towards the earl, and said with much ex-&#xD;
citement:&#xD;
"It is the Lady Catharine Vane, my lord-it&#xD;
is his sister."&#xD;
"I will at once speak with her," he answered,&#xD;
and approached the door, which he unlocked.--&#xD;
The maiden stood before it, with- her toilette&#xD;
considerably dishevelled, her rich hair freely&#xD;
floating upon her shoulders, and her beauty in-&#xD;
creased by the excitement of her feelings.&#xD;
" Lady Catharine Vane, I am not your jailer,&#xD;
but your debtor," said the earl, courteously.&#xD;
"Why are we detained prisoners? What is&#xD;
this I have overheard about the execution of my&#xD;
brother ?" she asked, earnestly.&#xD;
"Lord Rudolph is not to be executed if you&#xD;
ask his life ; but he is nevertheless doomed to a&#xD;
punishment that no mediation can save him&#xD;
from. In me, lady, you behold Lord Villiers.&#xD;
This name is enough to show you what Iowe to&#xD;
your generous interposition, and what I owe to&#xD;
your brother. Here let me thank you, both for,&#xD;
my daughter arid for myself, for the life which&#xD;
you were instrumental in saving from the block."&#xD;
"Then spare my brother ! 0, he is already&#xD;
dead !" she exclaimed, on discovering him upon&#xD;

"Nay, it is only a swoon"&#xD;
"0, spare his life, my noble lord I"&#xD;
" I will do so, for your sake. And he shall&#xD;
understand that to you alone he owes it."&#xD;
At this moment, in looking around her, her&#xD;
eyes fell on Guilford, who was standing near, re-&#xD;
served and diffident, listening to what was said.&#xD;
She no sooner beheld him, than she seemed to&#xD;
forget everything else, everybody about her ; for,&#xD;
running towards him, she caught him by both&#xD;
hands, and exclaimed, with the artless delight of&#xD;
a child, which amid strangers suddenly discovers&#xD;
a familiar face:&#xD;
" You here, Guilford!e Heaven be praised ?"&#xD;
The earl, who saw the act, and observed the&#xD;
expression of pure delight and frankness upon&#xD;
her beautiful face, was not a little surprised ;&#xD;
and when he saw this pleasure reflected from the&#xD;
handsome features of the young fisherman, he&#xD;
was not a little perplexed.&#xD;
" Do not fear, Lady Kate, you are safe, and in&#xD;
the hands of a noble gentleman," said Guilford,&#xD;
encouragingly.&#xD;
" I hope you are not here a prisoner t-that&#xD;
youare not in any danger ?"&#xD;
" Be assured, Lady Catharine," said the earl,&#xD;
smiling, that there is not at this moment a more&#xD;
honored person in this ship than this young&#xD;
man, who, I am pleased to see, is also known&#xD;
to you; to him I owe my life. He brought me&#xD;
off to my ship inhis boat, and without his gal-&#xD;
lant aid I should now no longer be alive."&#xD;
" Thanks-thanksl I am so glad you have&#xD;
been able to serve the earl. Ah, Guilford, my&#xD;
brother has done him great wrong. But, my&#xD;
lord, I beseech thee, forgive him."&#xD;
"Plead for me, Catharine h" suddenly called&#xD;
out the young noble, who had been brought to&#xD;
his senses. "Plead for me."&#xD;
" She has done so successfully, my lord," an-&#xD;
swered the-earl, coldly. "She has gained thy&#xD;
life for thee."&#xD;
" But my hand ! You will not cut off my&#xD;
hand?"&#xD;
" Were an angel to descend from the blue&#xD;
skies and ask me to spare thy hand, I would&#xD;
not do it. It is need and ripe justice that thou&#xD;
shouldst not go unpunished."&#xD;
"My lord, mercy for my brother.".&#xD;

maiden by the -hand, and leading her gently&#xD;

When the earl returned from the state-room young nobleman.&#xD;
where he had left the tearful maiden, he found  " Thou mightest as well talk to the axe that&#xD;

to intercede for him.                        The young lord was then led to the deck. He&#xD;

" I have no power, my lord," answered Guil- another a brazen basin; the third and fourth&#xD;
ford, who could not conceal his contempt for lanterns. A little in the advance stood the&#xD;
&#xD;
TIMn Y'OGFISHERMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
thirrgeon of the ship, with his instruments and&#xD;
bandages, added to which was a seething hot&#xD;
iron, for stopping the flow of the blood. The&#xD;
crew stood around, seven and eight deep, their&#xD;
bearded faces lighted up by the lanterns that&#xD;
hung in the rigging. Farther aft were the offi-&#xD;
cers, with their swords in their hands.&#xD;
When Lord Rudolph gazed on this scene, so&#xD;
well calculated to appal his nerves, he gave&#xD;
utterance to an audible groan.&#xD;
"Take him in hand, executioner," said the&#xD;
earl, " and at the stroke of'the ship's bell, do your&#xD;
duty. This man," added the earl, looking about&#xD;
him, "is to undergo a just punishment. By his&#xD;
information I was condemned to the scaffold;&#xD;
but through the intercession of a noble maiden,&#xD;
Cromwell was content with my hand. I have&#xD;
decreed that this young lord shall share the pun-&#xD;
ishment which his master inflicted upon me."&#xD;
At this there was a general murmur of appro-&#xD;
bation, and the interest deepened. Lord Rudolph,&#xD;
being led up to the block, was told to take off&#xD;
his coat. But not obeying, it was removed by&#xD;
another, and his arm was then stretched out and&#xD;
bound firmly, in spite of his struggles and shrieks,&#xD;
to the block. The executioner's axe descended&#xD;
upon the wrist, and while a thrilling shriek rent&#xD;
their ears from the victim, the bleeding hand was&#xD;
caught in the brazen basin. The chirurgeon in-&#xD;
stantly proceeded to perform his duty, and to&#xD;
staunch the blood, while the stern earl, turning&#xD;
away from the spot, re-entered the state-room.&#xD;
"That act of justice done, I am more content&#xD;
to be branded as Red Hand, as men, catching&#xD;
up Cromwell's epithet, have called me, far and&#xD;
wide. But the protector shall feel that if one of&#xD;
my hands is baptized in the blood of the scaffold,&#xD;
the other hath power enough in its strong nerve&#xD;
to shake his usurped throne !"&#xD;
The earl walked up and down his cabin three&#xD;
or four times, under much excitement, which the&#xD;
recent occurrence had naturally awakened in&#xD;
his bosom. He then looked around, as if he&#xD;
were seeking some one.&#xD;
What, ho ! where is young Graham ?" he&#xD;
asked of the sentry, who stood by the half open&#xD;
door which led into the inner apartment.&#xD;
"He -passed in, my lord, urging that he must&#xD;
speak with the lady, and as youhad left the door&#xD;
open, I did not consider that she was to be re-&#xD;
garded as a prisoner."&#xD;
"'Very well; you are released from duty."&#xD;
The man returned, and the earl advanced to&#xD;
to the door, which was ajar, He opened it, and&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
was about to enter, when he arrested himself on&#xD;
the threshold at what he beheld. Kneeling at&#xD;
the feet of the weeping girl, was the young fish-&#xD;
erman, his hand clasping that of the high-born&#xD;
girl, and his face approaching hers, and expres.&#xD;
sive 6f the tenderest and most respectful symy&#xD;
pathy.&#xD;
"It is over now, Lady rate ! Tears are now&#xD;
of no avail! If it would have pleased thee, I&#xD;
would gladly have taken his place, though thou&#xD;
knowest I have little reason to love him. But&#xD;
all who are related to thee are near to me, for&#xD;
thy sake. Let us be content that his life was&#xD;
spared, for it was the captain's certain purpose&#xD;
to have hanged him, but for thee."&#xD;
" I cannot blame-I cannot reproach. Ru'&#xD;
dolph must feel the justice of his fate," she said,&#xD;
with sudden resolution. " But how camest thou&#xD;
on board this terrible vessel ?".&#xD;
" I came to bring off the captain, who, being&#xD;
on shore, was set upon and nearly slain by&#xD;
Cromwell's troopers; and although I was on&#xD;
my way, dearest Lady Kate, to the castle to see&#xD;
thee, I turned aside for his safety, and came&#xD;
hither, little expecting to find thee on board as&#xD;
I have done."&#xD;
" My brother, when he had taken me from&#xD;
your fishing boat, how I chanced to be in which&#xD;
I explained to him, Instead of going to land,&#xD;
hovered in the channel till night, and then be-&#xD;
gan to watch this vessel, which he was expect-&#xD;
ing, for he had been out in his yacht for four&#xD;
nights, waiting to intercept the captain from&#xD;
the land when he should come on board, as I&#xD;
heard him say to the young man with him, who&#xD;
is one of Cromwell's agents. Do you know who&#xD;
the captain is !" she asked pointedly, and in an,&#xD;
under tone.&#xD;
"The Earl Villiers."&#xD;
" Yes, but are you aware that this ship is that&#xD;
of the far-famed Red Hand ?"&#xD;
"Of Red Hand the buccaneer ?" exclaimed.&#xD;
Guilford, starting to his feet with surprise.&#xD;
"Earl Villiers and Red Hand, of whom I&#xD;
have heard you name the bold exploits, are one&#xD;
and the same person."&#xD;
"Can this be possible? Are you in the power&#xD;
of this terrible man ?"&#xD;
"You mistake him. It is the common people,&#xD;
the round-heads, who call him a pirate. He is&#xD;
no buccaneer, Guilford, but an exiled noble, who&#xD;

A&#xD;
&#xD;
THE interview with which the last chapter&#xD;
closed having thus happily terminated, the earl,&#xD;
after complimenting Guilford on his spirit, pro-&#xD;
posed to him, if nothing better offered,, to take&#xD;
service with him in his ship.&#xD;
" We shall not always be wanderers over the&#xD;
sea, my friend," he said ; " the prince will one&#xD;
day gain his throne, and then we shall be at the&#xD;
top. As for Lady Catharine's heart, you may&#xD;
be sure that it is in the right place; and I have&#xD;
a higher regard for you than before, since I find&#xD;
you possess qualities to win the attachment of&#xD;
so lovely a lady, who, in the.brightness of your&#xD;
character, can discover no obscurity of birth.--&#xD;
Now I have one favor to ask of you," added the&#xD;
earl, " and that is, that you will take command of&#xD;
the yacht and convey Lord Rudolph and his&#xD;
fair sister safely back to Castle Vane. He will,&#xD;
of course, be something of an invalid, and must&#xD;
be tenderly cared for. The person who was&#xD;
taken with him in the yacht, is a spy of Crom-&#xD;
well's, and I shall take care of him here. If at&#xD;
any time you wish to join my fortunes, you will&#xD;
hear of me, if you will run over in your boat to&#xD;
the French coast, and land on the island of Al-&#xD;
derney, off Cape de la Hague. At that little&#xD;
port there is an inn, painted red. The landlord&#xD;
always knows my term  of absence when I am&#xD;
away; and any line left there for me will be&#xD;
faithfully given into my possession when I put&#xD;
in there."&#xD;
Guilford thanked the ,earl for his kindness, and&#xD;
answered that he thought he should very soon&#xD;
be compelled to take him at his word and seek&#xD;
service with him.&#xD;
Thou shalt be welcome, and although I can&#xD;
do but little for thee under my present fortunes,&#xD;
some day, when I rise, you will rise with me."&#xD;
But, my noble earl, I fear," said Guilford,&#xD;
&#xD;
sadly, " that I shall hardly ever rise so high as&#xD;
to be able to offer the Lady Catharine a hand&#xD;
that would not be despised br ier proud house."&#xD;
" Courage, my brave youth. In these toppling&#xD;
times, they who are qt the bottom of the ladder&#xD;
to-day, to-morrow may stand on the top round.&#xD;
With a face, figure, health and courage like&#xD;
yours, and above all, with such a prize to win,&#xD;
you have nothing to fear."&#xD;
This conversation took place in the outer cab-&#xD;
in. The officer of the deck now entered and re-&#xD;
ported that the yacht was alongside, and her&#xD;
crew on board, and all was ready for her depar-&#xD;
ture.&#xD;
" That is as it should be. Now, my young&#xD;
friend, you must convey Lord Rudolph and the&#xD;
maiden to Castle Vane. Go on lioard, and&#xD;
Lady Catharine shall be escorted by me into the&#xD;
yacht."&#xD;
Guilford then took a grateful leave of the for-&#xD;
midable Red Hand, in whose dread presence ho&#xD;
could scarcely realize himself to have been, and&#xD;

brightly upon its low deck, on which, stretched&#xD;
upon a cot, he saw the prostrate form of Lord&#xD;
Rudolph, looking ghastly pale in the face. He&#xD;
advanced towards him, and said, kindly:&#xD;
" I hope, my lord, you do not suffer a great&#xD;
deal of pain-!"&#xD;
"Pain ! I endure infernal torments. Who are&#xD;
you ? I see, now. What do you want in my&#xD;

of it, and see you safely to Castle Vane, as he&#xD;

. 41&#xD;
&#xD;
In a frame of mind far from welcome, Lord&#xD;
Rudolph lay upon his couch; for his pride strug-&#xD;
gling with a fierce sentiment of hatred and cra-&#xD;
yen fear, and mingling with some little degree&#xD;
of remorse, kept up a fearful tempest of passion&#xD;
in his inmost soul. Lady Catharine left him&#xD;
on her message to Guilford, a prey to emotions&#xD;
of perfect torture. However, by an effort&#xD;
stronger than was his wont, he checked their&#xD;
away, and awaited, coolly as he might, the an-&#xD;
swer of Guilford.&#xD;
" H: says he has no desire to report it," she&#xD;
answered, after going to the helm where Guil-&#xD;
ford stood, steering the vessel in towards the&#xD;
foot of the cliff.&#xD;
"1I shall take care to keep it myself," he mut-&#xD;
tered, smiling, as if he heard her words with&#xD;
evident satisfaction.&#xD;
The yacht now drew nearer the land, and was&#xD;
soon within the black shadow cast by the tall&#xD;
cliff. A few minutes afterwards she came to&#xD;
the stone pier, where the boats of the castle were&#xD;
usually moored. Here Guilford' brought the&#xD;
yacht skilfully to alongside the landing steps.--&#xD;
The men obeyed his orders in furling the can-&#xD;
vass and making her fast; and then taking the&#xD;
cot up on which the young lord was lying, they&#xD;
proceeded to bear him ashore, and convey him&#xD;
up the steep path to the castle. Guilford gave&#xD;
his whole attention to the comfort of the invalid,&#xD;
taking care that thbe men moved steadily and&#xD;
cautiously, while Lady Kate went on before.-&#xD;
At length they reached the gate of the castle,&#xD;
here, after delivering his charge to the warder,&#xD;
to whom Lord Rudolph said he had been mere-&#xD;
ly wounded in a duello, he left to return to his&#xD;
own home. But he had not advanced ten steps&#xD;
from the portcullis, ere he was detained by the&#xD;
voice of Lady Kate, close at his side.&#xD;
" Why, Guilford, you do not well to take your&#xD;
leave so quickly, or rather no leave at all. You&#xD;
have not given me time to thank you."&#xD;
"I did but fear to irritate your brother more&#xD;
if he Saw,me take leave of thee," he answered,&#xD;
pressing to his lips the hand she placed in his.&#xD;
" You are too guarded, Guilford. You know&#xD;
not how proud I have been of you this day and&#xD;
night past. I cannot return without expressing&#xD;
my sense of your noble delicacy. I appreciate&#xD;
and understand it all. From this time we know&#xD;
each other, and you will not mistrust me ?"&#xD;
"Mistrust thee, Lady Kate ?",&#xD;
"Nay, that is not the word, exactly. But you&#xD;
will not doubt my regard for you ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
40&#xD;
&#xD;
L&#xD;
&#xD;
" I cannot ; you are too kind, when you know,&#xD;
as I now do fully, how far beneath you I am."&#xD;
" Love knows no rank. You are worthy of&#xD;
me, or I should never have loved or cared for&#xD;
you. How like you Red Hand ?"&#xD;
"And that noble gentleman and right hearted&#xD;
patriot was the famous sea king I have heard so&#xD;
much of. How difficult it is for me to realize&#xD;
that in the Earl Villiers I saw none other than&#xD;
that celebrated captain."&#xD;
"Do you not like him?"&#xD;
"It seems to me I could diewfor him."&#xD;
" So do all men who know him, my father&#xD;
says; and he is not the least of his friends. But&#xD;
how shall I forgive him his act of to-night ?"&#xD;
" It was terrible retribution, Lady Kate, but&#xD;
was it not deserved ?"&#xD;
" I cannot deny it. My brother has deeply&#xD;
wronged him; and perhaps it is just he himself&#xD;
should endure something of the suffering he has&#xD;
inflicted upon him. It was a mercy that he&#xD;
spared his life. Now, my noble friend, since we&#xD;
must part, tell me frankly where you are to go-&#xD;
what course you have marked out for yourself,&#xD;
so that one day you may come back and ask my&#xD;
hand of my father; for, as thou bast said thou&#xD;
must achieve somewhat to please him and give&#xD;
thee honor. I will wait thy time, true to thee,&#xD;
even to death, so that thou comest not in life to&#xD;
claim me as thine."&#xD;
This was spoken with all the truthfulness and&#xD;
sweet confidence of a woman who loves with all&#xD;
her heart.&#xD;
"I have hardly formed a plan, dear Lady&#xD;
Kate. I will, by to-morrow,. decide. But my&#xD;
mind is so full of the Earl of the Red Hand, that&#xD;
I shall probably decide by going to offer him my&#xD;
services."&#xD;
" That would please me, Guilford. He thinks&#xD;
much of you. Though he is now but the head&#xD;
of a small company, and commands but a single&#xD;
ship under good King Charles the First, he was&#xD;
lord high admiral, and ruled navies by his nod."&#xD;
"I will follow his fortunes."&#xD;
" Thou wilt not be led astray? The times&#xD;
are ripening, my father says, for the throne to&#xD;
have its own again. The land is weary of the&#xD;
protectorate and its tyranny. Prince Charles&#xD;
has been defeated, it is true, and is now a fugi-&#xD;
tive, either in Scotland or England, at this mo-&#xD;
ment ; but if he escape over sea, he will then be&#xD;
the rallying point for armies of tens of thous-&#xD;
ands."&#xD;
" It was rumored yesterday," said Guilford,&#xD;

the disguise of a pack-man, travelling south. It&#xD;
was also reported that one who had known him&#xD;
perfectly, saw the same pack-man in Berkshire,&#xD;

are true, and the prince is making his way to&#xD;
the south of England, hoping to find a passage&#xD;
across to France."&#xD;
" Heaven grant that he may reach France in&#xD;
safety, and foil all his foes," said Guilford, with&#xD;
warmth. " But Cromwell is so vigilant, his&#xD;
emissaries are so numerous, his spies so vigilant,&#xD;

Here they stopped, and Lady Kate, taking&#xD;
Guilford by the hand, looked him earnestly in&#xD;

" You are going to seek your fortune and win&#xD;
a name. But remember, I do not ask either&#xD;
from you; but they are your own voluntary&#xD;
wish; and never forget that, if after all, you&#xD;
should return unfortunate, and without the suc-&#xD;
cess you hope for, you will be received by me&#xD;
with the same affection with which I now part&#xD;
from you."&#xD;
The lovers now took leave of each other, and&#xD;
Guilford hastened down the precipitous path&#xD;
without trusting his eyes to look back and take&#xD;
another look of theI fair form which he knew was&#xD;
lingering to gaze after him.&#xD;

GUILFORD found the door of the cottage ajar,&#xD;
and pushing it softly, he entered the small,&#xD;
plainly furnished front room. A lamp filled&#xD;
with fish oil burned upon the table, with a huge&#xD;
" thief"upon the wick. By its light he saw the&#xD;
two troopers. Upon a small truckle bed in the&#xD;
corner lay one of them, sleeping off the pota-&#xD;
tions of negus with which he and his comrade&#xD;
had been abundantly plied by the good dame,&#xD;
who desired to get them in a state of quiescence&#xD;
as soon as possible ; a result in which she had&#xD;
admirably succeeded. Sleeping heavily, and&#xD;
with a loud, sonorous breathing, the other&#xD;
trooper sat by the table, his head among the&#xD;
cups, and resting on his thickly gloved hand.-&#xD;
His black beard lay out upon the board like a&#xD;
mop, while the light shone upon his round, close-&#xD;
ly shaven head, giving it the appearance of a&#xD;
porcupine rolled up into a ball. By the side of&#xD;
his head lay his pistolet, the grasp of his hand&#xD;
holding it loosely in his sleep. The two men re-&#xD;
minded Guilford of two wild beasts he had once&#xD;
seen crouched and reposing in a cage.&#xD;
Having surveyed the scene, he stepped across&#xD;
the threshold and passed lightly into the room.&#xD;
He stood for an instant looking at the sallow&#xD;
face of Strait-gate, who lay on the bed, and&#xD;
wondering that so wicked a countenance could&#xD;
&#xD;
army, who, with a few scraps of the Old Testa-&#xD;
ment on their lips, passed for pious covenanters,&#xD;
and under the cloak of religion, did all sorts of&#xD;
enormities.A&#xD;
"Let them sleep ; I have no wish to disturb&#xD;
them," said Guilford, passing on and opening&#xD;
the inner door of his mother's room. "I have&#xD;
already placed one of their number in the sleep&#xD;
that knows no waking." And with this recollec-&#xD;
tion of what lie had done the evening before,&#xD;
came over his mind for the first time the thought&#xD;
that he might possibly be recognized by some&#xD;
of the party who had been nighest when he shot&#xD;
the soldier, though it was moonlight and not&#xD;
broad day, and no one came within twenty&#xD;
yards of him, save the horseman who was&#xD;
drowned in attempting to swim his horse round&#xD;
the promontory.&#xD;
Upon hearing the door open, his mother looked&#xD;
up from her needle, and seeing him, uttered an&#xD;
exclamation of joy, and going towards him to&#xD;
meet him, made at the same time a gesture of&#xD;
silence and warning.'&#xD;
"Iam so glad you have returned, my dear&#xD;
son," she said, as she led him to a seat. " You&#xD;
have been gone full eight hours."&#xD;
"It has been an eventful eighthours to me, my&#xD;

&#xD;
" Yes, mother, and all is as I would desire. I&#xD;
will tell you by-and-by, when we are alone.-&#xD;
Those men in the other room must have annoyed&#xD;
you not a little."&#xD;
" They did at first, but they soon drank them-&#xD;
selves to insensibility. But where is Anne, that&#xD;
she did not come in with you ?"&#xD;
" She is at the gate with Robin."&#xD;
"Yes. He loves her, and I wish she could re-&#xD;
turn his attachment. She had best come in, now&#xD;
you are at home ; but I sent her out, as the soldiers&#xD;
got to be something rude of speech towards her."&#xD;
" They had best keep their tongues under&#xD;
civility," answered Guilford, "or I will show&#xD;
thea that there are men in England besides&#xD;
Cromwell's myrmidons."&#xD;
" Hist, Guilford! They will hear you. As it&#xD;
is,they do not suspect us of being opposed to the'&#xD;
government. But listen to me; I have some-&#xD;
thing of moment to communicate to thee ; and&#xD;
for this I have been so anxious to have thee come&#xD;
back."&#xD;
"But first hear what will please you, my dear&#xD;
mother. My interview with Lady Kate resulted&#xD;
in her refusal to permit me to cease to think of&#xD;
her, and it is decided that I am to seek my for-&#xD;
tune in the world, and some bright day come&#xD;
back to ask her hand."&#xD;
" Ah, my boy, fortune is fickle. But the Lady&#xD;
Catharine shows a truly noble nature."&#xD;
"I have no doubt that I shall be able to win&#xD;
some name that will make me less obscure, and&#xD;
more worthy to ask her hand of her noble father.&#xD;
Would she wed me to-morrow, I am too proud&#xD;
to become her husband as I am-a poor young&#xD;
fisherman. I will win rank and name, and lay&#xD;
them at her feet., Because she loves me in my&#xD;
humble state, shall I willingly consent that she&#xD;
shall wed one so lowly ? Shall I thus reward&#xD;
her generous love ?"&#xD;
" Thou art noble in mind, my boy," said his&#xD;
mother, " and deservest her."&#xD;
"Mother, thou hast heard of Red Hand ?"&#xD;
" Oi Red Hand, the noted sea warrior, whose&#xD;
very name strikes such terror along the coast !&#xD;
What of him, Guilford ?"&#xD;
" Dost thou know his history ?"&#xD;
-        "Nay, I do recollect that it is said he was one&#xD;
of King Charles's nobles, and that, when he was&#xD;
to have been executed, he placed his hand be-&#xD;
neath the axe instead of his head, and with the&#xD;
other wrenched the weapon from the headsman's&#xD;
grasp, and with it cut his way to the water-side&#xD;
ana escaped in a ship."&#xD;

" This is partly true."&#xD;
" I know Cromwell has a reward for his head,&#xD;
and therefore-"&#xD;
" You fancy he must be a pirate."&#xD;
"I know not what he is. Men say he is great-&#xD;
ly to be feared. He has burned full a score of&#xD;
castles and towns on the sea coast."&#xD;
" These were those places in which Crom-&#xD;
well's minions dwelt-places, of which, by false-&#xD;
hood and wrong, they had robbed loyal nobles.&#xD;
I have seen this sea king, and spoken with him,&#xD;
mother."&#xD;
"Spoken with Red Hand?"&#xD;
" Yes ; I have been on board his vessel, which&#xD;
to-night was not two leagues from the land,&#xD;
o p site the village. He is a proper gentleman.&#xD;
He is the Earl of Villiers, a true-hearted noble-&#xD;
man, and friend of both the late king and Prince&#xD;
Charles."&#xD;
" Speak lower, for there are strange ears near&#xD;
us."&#xD;
" The two brutes are asleep, and I pray they&#xD;
may not wake till morning. Yes, mother, Earl&#xD;
Villiers is a true English gentleman. He com-&#xD;
mands a ship because he cannot command a&#xD;
fleet. His wars are made only against the&#xD;
usurper. His ship is the only remnant of the&#xD;
true British navy, and he the only British ad-&#xD;
miral, as Charles, the wanderer prince, is the&#xD;
only British king. But these things will not&#xD;
always be so. In a few days I shall, if nothing&#xD;
more favorable turns up, offer myself to this&#xD;
admiral of the Red Hand, and win fame under&#xD;
his flag."&#xD;
" If this terrible captain be a true earl, who&#xD;
only seeks the rights of his king, I do not say&#xD;
aught against this, Guilford, save that I shall be&#xD;
grieved to have thee leave my roof and my side.&#xD;
But mothers cannot always hope to have their&#xD;
boys with them; and I hope to see you yet dis-&#xD;
tinguish yourself."&#xD;
" You will not be alone, mother. Anne will&#xD;
remain, and if she marries Robin-&#xD;
" Marries Robin? I wish she would, indeed."&#xD;
"There is little doubt of it from what I saw&#xD;
to-night. They are lovers, or lovers never&#xD;
were."&#xD;
" That is good news at last. Iknew she need&#xD;
never look to you."&#xD;

THE YOUNG FISHERMAN&#xD;
&#xD;
"But what, my young friend ?" asked the&#xD;
stranger, who seemed to hang on his words with&#xD;
nervous eagerness.&#xD;
" The difficulty is to get off from the coast&#xD;
unseen. There are not only troops placed in&#xD;
our houses, but they are posted as sentries along&#xD;
the streets, and have the beach in full view for&#xD;
miles. It would be almost impossible to get a.&#xD;
boat off with any chance of success."&#xD;
The stranger clasped his hands together with&#xD;
an expression of anguish.&#xD;
" So near liberty, and yet not to be able to&#xD;
obtain it !"&#xD;
" Does thy life pay the forfeit, sir, of thy cap-&#xD;
ture ?" asked Guilford, whose heart was deeply&#xD;
moved by his acute distress.&#xD;
" Assuredly, my friend."&#xD;
" And thou art a true friend of the prince ?"/&#xD;
"He has none nearer."&#xD;
"Then I will save thee if it be possible, by&#xD;
aiding thee to reach the French shore. But the&#xD;
prince, where is he ? Hast thou any tidings of&#xD;
him since he was seen last in Scotland ?"&#xD;
" He still wanders. Like me he seeks to find&#xD;
shelter in France. Suppose I were the Prince&#xD;
Charles himself, what couldst thou do for me, if&#xD;
I told thee I was really in thy hands ?"&#xD;
"I would save thee or perish !" answered&#xD;
Guilford; "and I will do all I can for one who&#xD;
loves him  and suffers for him. - Here it is not&#xD;
safe for thee-to remain till morning."&#xD;
" Young man," said the stranger, "if thou&#xD;
safest me, the prince will not fail to reward&#xD;
thee."&#xD;
"I ask no reward, sir cavalier, save success.&#xD;
I will ere long return to you. I will go and see&#xD;
how I can best secure your safety."&#xD;
With these words Guilford took leave .of his&#xD;
guest, deeply interested in him, and opening the&#xD;
trap door, dropped lightly to the floor.&#xD;
" Mother, he is a cavalier, and friend of the&#xD;
prince, and his life is forfeit if he be taken. He&#xD;
brings no other news of Prince Charles than&#xD;
that he is a wanderer like himself. Now I must&#xD;
get him out from here, and to the sea-side. I&#xD;
have resolved to try and get him across the&#xD;
channel."&#xD;
" You will risk your own life, my son."&#xD;
"'Do not think of me, mother. I shall do&#xD;
nothing rashly. Give me thy brown long gown&#xD;
and shawl and hood."&#xD;
" Here they are. What wouldst thou with&#xD;
them ?"&#xD;
" To handthem up to our guest to put on."&#xD;
&#xD;
Guilford suited the action to the word, by&#xD;
rolling the articles in a bundle and passing them&#xD;
up to the fugitive.&#xD;
"Put these on, and wait till I knock thrice&#xD;
on the trap, and then come boldly down. Now,&#xD;
mother," he added, as the trap door was once&#xD;
more closed, and the ladder carefully removed,&#xD;
" I want you to put on your other shawl and&#xD;
hood and walk out with me."&#xD;
" Whither ?"&#xD;
"It matters not, dear mother, Do not ask&#xD;
me questions that I perhaps can't answer but&#xD;
if you will kindly do as I say, we may save the&#xD;
young cavalier."&#xD;
" I will be guided by you in everything, my&#xD;
son," said she, putting on her shawl and hood.&#xD;
" That is right, mother. These barbarians of&#xD;
Cromwell's are still snoring. They sleep sound&#xD;
as moles."&#xD;
" I drugged their negus to make them sleep&#xD;
and keep them quiet,' answered his mother.&#xD;
" That accounts for it. It is the more favora-&#xD;
ble to us. Now take my arm and come with&#xD;
me."&#xD;
The good dame placed her arm in his, and&#xD;
crossing noiselessly the room where the troopers&#xD;
were, they went out by the gate of the cottage.&#xD;
Here they met with Robin and Anne, who hard-&#xD;
ly realized how the night they had so lovingly&#xD;
passed was wearing towards morning. They&#xD;
both started consciously as they saw dame Gra-&#xD;
ham and Guilford.&#xD;
" You've come at last, Guilford," said Robin,&#xD;
not knowing anything else to say.&#xD;
"Yes; and I warrant me you were not over&#xD;
weary waiting for me. I want you, Robin."&#xD;
" Anne, you had best go softly in and remain&#xD;
in the back room; if the troopers should wake&#xD;
up, you can bolt the door.",&#xD;
"Let Anne wait here by the gate, mother.-&#xD;
You will not be away five minutes. Robin, go&#xD;
to your boat; place secretly three days' provis-&#xD;
ions in it, and put off as expeditiously as you&#xD;
can, as if on a fishing cruise. Soon as you get&#xD;
out half a mile, lower your sails and row back&#xD;
in the direction of the beach rock; landing be-&#xD;
yond it on the castle side. There you will find&#xD;
me to take me on board. Do not delay, and be&#xD;
discreet and cautious ; for the least imprudence&#xD;
will create suspicion among the coast guard."&#xD;
Robin signified his readiness to do as his&#xD;
friend Guilford had directed, and immediately&#xD;
left the cottage gate and walked towards his&#xD;
own cabin, a quarter of a mile further east,&#xD;

along the shore-curved street of the little port&#xD;
He was stopped by two troopers, who, satisfying&#xD;
themselves that he was a fisherman, and not a&#xD;
prince in disguise, let him pass. At the door of&#xD;
his own hut he found three of the guard seated&#xD;
drinking ale, and eating rolls and dried fish.-&#xD;
He adroitly got them into conversation upon the&#xD;
comparative speed of boats and horses, and&#xD;
drew them down to the cove, fifty paces off,&#xD;
where his own smack lay, and got them to ex-&#xD;
amining it, lie the while descanting upon its&#xD;
speed. He then proposed to show them with&#xD;
what rapidity he could row it, saying: " As it is&#xD;
near day, it is time I should get ready to go out&#xD;
to fish; but first I will show you her mettlT."&#xD;
He then went in for his oars, and at the same&#xD;
time filled a bag with fish and bread, and took&#xD;
a beaker of fresh water with him. These he&#xD;
placed in the boat before their eyes, trusting to&#xD;
their absence of all suspicion that he had any&#xD;
second purpose in view. At length, having got&#xD;
all prepared, he loosed his boat and got to his&#xD;
oars, and was about to row her out, when a&#xD;
fourth, in the uniform of a sergeant, came up&#xD;
and demanded what boat was putting off."&#xD;
"A fisher's lad going off to cruise the day in&#xD;
the channel catching fish," answered a trooper ;&#xD;
"and lie has bet a hundred mackerel that his&#xD;
boat, with two oars, can beat the best hunter in&#xD;
England."&#xD;
"le is a braggart," answered the sergeant.-&#xD;
"But who has been in the boat and seen that&#xD;
there is no Prince Charley hidden in the caddie.&#xD;
By the beard of Cromwell, it would hide two&#xD;
men!"&#xD;
"No one has searched," answered one of the&#xD;
troopers.&#xD;
The boat was detained and the cuddle care-&#xD;
fully examined, when, as nothing was discovered&#xD;
like a refugee, and Robin being clearly the only&#xD;
person on board, he was suffered to put off.-&#xD;
His bungling rowing to and fro, however, as lie&#xD;
knew it would be, was laughed at by the soldiers,&#xD;
and having acknowledged that his craft was not&#xD;
in trim, he hoisted sail, and told them that when&#xD;
he hail caught the hundred mackerel, he would&#xD;
not fail to pay his bet. He was soon rapidly&#xD;
leaving the shore behind, and the 'forms of the&#xD;
soldiers soon blended with the indistinct objects&#xD;
on the land. When he had gained half a mile&#xD;
from the beach, he lowered his two sails, and&#xD;
taking to his oars, pulled towards the point&#xD;
nearly a mile westerly, where Guilford had&#xD;
promised to be found.&#xD;
&#xD;
We now return to the young fisherman who&#xD;
was so generously about to attempt to save his&#xD;
guest from the power of the usurper. When&#xD;
Robin took leave of him to go on the mission&#xD;
we have seen him accomplish so successfully,&#xD;
Guilford, with his mother leaning on his arm,&#xD;
walked along the village street ia the direction&#xD;
which led towards the castle. They soon cane&#xD;
to two troopers, who-were standing in the street&#xD;
acting as guards. The moonlight shone full&#xD;
upon them, and in one of them Guilford recog-&#xD;
nized the soldier who had before challenged&#xD;
him. As the young man and his mother drew&#xD;
near, one of the men stepped across the way&#xD;
and presented his broad-sword.&#xD;
' What, pray, is this, my fine couple ?" he&#xD;
said, with a laugh.&#xD;
"This is my mother ; and as for me, I told&#xD;
you who I was some while ago," answered&#xD;
Guilford, firmly.&#xD;
" Yes, I recollect thee now.; but we must see&#xD;
thy face. We must not let any nose pass us&#xD;
under cover. A woman's hood, before now, has&#xD;

Dame Graham put back her hood and showed&#xD;
him a dignified, but pale, matronly face, that&#xD;
abashed his insolence.&#xD;
"Pardon us, ma'am, but we have to be&#xD;
strict."&#xD;
"Can we pass on ?" asked Guilford.&#xD;
" Whither ?"&#xD;
" To the castle. There is a sick person with-&#xD;
in one of the apartments who suffers, and your&#xD;
orders are not so strict as to prevent passing to&#xD;
and fro on the land ?"&#xD;
"No; it is the sea we are to watch."&#xD;
Guilford then went on a few steps, and when&#xD;
beyond ear-shot, he whispered hurriedly to his&#xD;
mother:&#xD;
"Pretend that thou bast forgotten the lint,&#xD;
and go back as for it; but instead of coming&#xD;
back thyself, send the guest, telling him I wait&#xD;
here, and that he must join me and take my&#xD;
arm without a word. in your place. They will&#xD;
not a second time lift the veil."&#xD;
"I now understand all," said his mother.&#xD;
"Sir soldier, my mother would return a mo-&#xD;
ment to the house for something," he said, re-&#xD;
turning where the two men stood. "Be quick,&#xD;
dear mother, and I will remain talking with&#xD;
these brave soldiers."&#xD;
The good dame hastened towards her house,&#xD;
leaving Guilford with the troopers&#xD;

fully.&#xD;
" I think I recognize the voice," said the&#xD;
stranger. " Hold ! Let me speak."&#xD;

will hail them. Who are you, and where do you&#xD;

other voice.&#xD;
"I know them !" cried the stranger to Guilford,&#xD;
in earnest excitement, laying his hand on his&#xD;
shoulder. "They are two of the prince's friends.&#xD;
Will you take them ?"&#xD;
" Willingly. Think you the prince is one of&#xD;
them ?"&#xD;

Guilford at once ran the smack to the little&#xD;
cove in the land where the two men stood. On&#xD;
coming near he saw from their torn apparel and&#xD;
haggard air that they were fugitives, They were&#xD;
so impatient to quit the land, that the boat had&#xD;

on board.&#xD;
" Take us across to France, and we will repay&#xD;
you well, for we have gold," they said, talking&#xD;
like %nen who had life at stake.&#xD;
The stranger, who still wore the female dress,&#xD;
and who had purposely concealed himself behind&#xD;
the sail, was now seen by them. They stared at&#xD;
him, and then took their seats, as if too weary to&#xD;
stand. They then looked earnestly at Robin&#xD;
and Guilford.&#xD;
" You are fishermen, then ?" said the eldest of&#xD;
the two, inquiringly.&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Will you take us over to Normandy ?"&#xD;
'It is a dangerous trip, sirs, but as Iam going&#xD;
over, you shall have passage."&#xD;
" How fortunate. We will give you gold,"&#xD;
" I am well paid, gentlemen."&#xD;
" but will you take this woman over ?"&#xD;
" Yes," answered Guilford ,and he would have&#xD;
added, "slhe is afugitive disguised also," but fbr&#xD;
a pressure upon the arm by the stranger, as a&#xD;
hint fromhim to keep his secret.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, my lord. Robin is a youth, and sup-, " I pray that thy words may come true. And if&#xD;

hoped that this turn in the tide of his affairs was  "No, it was the Earl Villiers, whom they call&#xD;

When the smack, which Robin had named the  "The Earl Villiers !" exclaimed the strange-,&#xD;
" Pretty Anne," had got out a mile, the day had in a tone that, coming from the woman's hood,&#xD;
begun to brighten up so clearly in the east that made the two cavaliers start with surprise, and&#xD;

surprise, and let him know that he had indeed&#xD;

"Too much joy ! too much joy I That we&#xD;
should find thee in the very boat in which we have&#xD;
taken shelter. This day Cromwell's hatred has&#xD;
foreverlost its victim."&#xD;
Guilford had witnessed this revelation of the&#xD;
prince to his partners in danger and flight with&#xD;
amazement. He stood beholding him without&#xD;
power to utter a word. A half formed idea that&#xD;
all his hopes were now in the budding, and that&#xD;
Lady Kate would yet be his, dancedbewilderingly&#xD;
through his mind. Robin stood with open mouth,&#xD;
in wonder and delight.&#xD;
"Nay, my friends," said Prince Charles, "you&#xD;
must not be shut out from being partakers of all&#xD;
this joy. You have, you find, had your wish&#xD;
gratified, and have' the prince' in your boat."&#xD;
"And I will save thee or die, my prince !" ex-&#xD;
olaimed Guilford, kneeling and kissing his hand.&#xD;
"This is the happiest and proudest moment of my&#xD;
life."&#xD;
Robin also came forward and saluted the ex-&#xD;
cited monarch, and all was joy and intense excite-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
While the little vessel with its precious freight&#xD;
was dancing on its way, Guilford directed Robin&#xD;
to bring up the provisions from the cuddie, and&#xD;
the prince and his two lords made a royal feast of&#xD;
i% with such appetites as long fasting invariably&#xD;
lends to both king and peasant.&#xD;
The sun was an hour high when they had all&#xD;
got through their morning's repast, and then&#xD;
Guilford urged the prince to take some repose in&#xD;
one of the, berths in the small cabin.&#xD;
"This is well proposed, my young friend," he&#xD;
said; " for I have had little sleep for the week&#xD;
Past."&#xD;
Leaving the helm in charge of Robin, Guil-&#xD;
ford went into the cuddie and arranged as well&#xD;
as. he could the cot of dried sea-weed for the&#xD;
prince, and when he would have apologized for&#xD;
its roughness, the latter said, cheerfully:&#xD;
"9Do not say one word, my dear Guilford, for&#xD;
I have learned to sleep as hard as the poorest of&#xD;
my subjects. I am used to rough fare and rough&#xD;
lodgings. But keep good watch, and do not let&#xD;
..ny large vessel come too near us. Call me if&#xD;
say war-Sbip is seen in any quarter."&#xD;
Gui ford having seen Prince Charles lie down&#xD;
&#xD;
to rest, returned to the deck. The faces of the&#xD;
two exiles beanied upon him with grateful&#xD;
smiles as he re-appeared.&#xD;
" You are the happiest and most to be envied&#xD;
Englishman that this day lives, yoang man,"&#xD;
said Lord Algernon, smiling ; "for you have&#xD;
under your charge the prince on whose safety&#xD;
depends the fate of England."&#xD;
" I am happier than I can express," answered&#xD;
Guilford, resuming the helm, while he gave an&#xD;
order to Robin to trim the sheets. " As we are&#xD;
now full a third of the way across the' channel,&#xD;
my lords," he added, " will you say what part&#xD;
of the French coast the prince would like to be&#xD;
landed upon ?"&#xD;
" To the east of Cape de la Hague, and as&#xD;
near the Cherbourg landing as may be," an-&#xD;
swered the Scottish lord. " We have friends&#xD;
there in waiting for many weeks."&#xD;
"The wind is not exactly fair for making&#xD;
Cherbourg," answered Guilford, looking at the&#xD;

running west by north four or five miles, we can&#xD;
then go about'and make it towards night."&#xD;
" Is there no danger that we shall be interfered&#xD;
with by the channel ships of war that are hover-&#xD;
ing on the coast to watch. against the prince's&#xD;
escape ?" asked the gray-bearded earl, with some&#xD;
solicitude, as he cast his eyes about him and&#xD;
saw four or five sail of vessels at various dis-&#xD;
tances, some of them between them and the dis-&#xD;
tant line of the coast of France, and one directly&#xD;
astern, as if in chase.&#xD;
" Are there ships cruising on the watch? my&#xD;
lords ?" asked Guilford, changing color. "I&#xD;
did not imagine danger save from the coast guard&#xD;
on shore."&#xD;
" There is great danger yet," answered both&#xD;
noblemen. "An crder has been sent to all the&#xD;
captains of the vessels of war to be vigilant in&#xD;
bringing to and examining every boat that&#xD;
crosses the channel."&#xD;
" I did not know of this," answered Guilford.&#xD;
He then stood up in the stern of the fishing&#xD;
vessel, which being but five tons burthen, did not&#xD;
elevate him but three or four feet above the level&#xD;
of the sea, and with a keen, nautical eye scanned&#xD;
carefully the, encircling horizon, commencing&#xD;
F north and returning to the same point.&#xD;
" What do you make out these vessels to be ?"&#xD;
asked Lord Algernon Dudley, the old noble,&#xD;
f trusting to the skill of the young saildr in mat-&#xD;
ters of which he himself had little experience.&#xD;
" The vessel astern, my lords, is a ship, that&#xD;

58                THE YOUNG FISHERMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
has just come out of Portsmouth. I saw her an&#xD;
hour ago, between the Isle of Wight and the&#xD;
main, standing down. She is a Norwegian tra-&#xD;
der by the shortness of her yards and square&#xD;
make of her bows."&#xD;
"You observe closely," said the young Scot-&#xD;
tish lord.&#xD;
" Yes ; We fishermen, passing our lives on the&#xD;
channel, and accustomed to the sight of ves-&#xD;
sels of all nations, soon discern the difference&#xD;
between thdse of one country and another, and&#xD;
are able to tell them a long ways off."&#xD;
"Yes, I can understand it,"' said Lord-Cates-&#xD;
by ; "for in the highlands the shepherds on the&#xD;
hills oan often tell men of different clans at a&#xD;
distance long before they can distinguish the&#xD;
plaid of their tartans. What vessel is that to&#xD;
the west ? It looks large, like an armed ship."&#xD;
"It is a ship of war of large size," answered&#xD;
Guilibrd; "but she is standing northward, and&#xD;
is bound into Portsmouth. She will hardly&#xD;
trouble ts."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Then this vessel at the east, which seems to&#xD;
be standing directly down to us ?"&#xD;
" That I am more doubtful about. She is too&#xD;
far off to. be well 'made out, and as her masts&#xD;
range in line, I can't'tell whether she is a ship&#xD;
or brig. But from the squareness of her yards&#xD;
and the way she settles in the water, I am afraid&#xD;
she is an armed cruiser."&#xD;
At these words the two nobles looked'verv&#xD;
naturally anxious, and watched her with close&#xD;
attention. There were two other vessels visible&#xD;
in the far south-western board, but at too remote&#xD;
a distance to be made anything of, save that&#xD;
Guilford was positive +hey were large, three&#xD;
masted vessels.&#xD;
The wind was blowing a five knot breeze,&#xD;
from W. S. W., and the little vessel, kept close-&#xD;
hauled, went steadily on her way, steering as&#xD;
near as possible for the Cape of the Hague, now&#xD;
about forty miles distant, in a south by west di-&#xD;

LEAVING the little fishing smack, Which held&#xD;
the destinies of England, to dance along over&#xD;
the waves of the channel on its way to the coast&#xD;
of Normandy, we will follow the adventures of&#xD;
another one of the characters of our story.&#xD;
When Red Hand the earl had regained his-&#xD;
own ship, and, after the severe execution of the&#xD;
sentence upon Lord Rudolph, had dismissed the&#xD;
yacht, he gave orders to his lieutenant in com-&#xD;
mand to steer westward until sunrise, and then&#xD;
call him.&#xD;
" I have not had one hour's sleep since I left&#xD;
London," he added to the officer, "and I must&#xD;
have a little rest."&#xD;
le then went to his state-room, where he found&#xD;
Edward, the youthful and handsome officer al-&#xD;
ready introduced to the reader, engaged in copy-&#xD;
ing papers. Upon the entrance of the earl, the&#xD;
youth looked up and fixed upon the earl his&#xD;
large dark eye, which had as much light in it as&#xD;
a woman's, and said :&#xD;
" My lord, I know not how to contain my joy&#xD;
at your sai return once more tothe ship, know-,&#xD;
ing, as I alone did, the perilous errand on which&#xD;
yon  went-"&#xD;
"I had a narrow cape of it more than once,&#xD;
EdwM'd," answered the Wr, throwing himself&#xD;
Sed a cushioned ettee.&#xD;
" Autt what sccesa, My lord l" asked the&#xD;
-   jA4 in a tone that slightly hesitated, as if he&#xD;
fNtd h feature too far to make so open an&#xD;
5tkreuil's head i' Still on his shoulder,&#xD;
*dg he is free to ride oa England's fleck till a&#xD;
mote lucky day for us. Would you like to hear&#xD;
the particulars '"&#xD;
&#xD;
" Yes, my lord ; I will first copy these tWo re-&#xD;
mainitig lines of the letter you have written to&#xD;
the Duke of Orleans, to be loft at Cherbourg."&#xD;
The youthful secretary then busied himself a&#xD;
minute till he had completed the task allotted to&#xD;
him, and then placing his pen by his side on the&#xD;
polished Bragiban table, placed himself in an&#xD;
attitude of listening. This young man, whose&#xD;
beauty; as we have said, was almost feminine,&#xD;
was about twenty years of age, slight in figure,&#xD;
but tall, and gracefully made. A brown mous-&#xD;
tache was just beginning to darken his well cut&#xD;
upper lip, and his rich and shining brown locks&#xD;
curled short about his circular and snow-white&#xD;
neck. His brows were also brown or hazel col-&#xD;
ored, like his hair, and exquisitely arched over a&#xD;
pair of large, well expanded eyes of the clearest&#xD;
gray. His nose was Persian, straight, and with&#xD;
thin nostrils-always marks of high birth.-&#xD;
When he spoke, rows of even teeth, as dewy and&#xD;
translucent as pearls, were visible. His hands&#xD;
were, as symmetrical as nature could have&#xD;
moula d them, and his whole air and tone were&#xD;
striking and distinguished. There was an ex-&#xD;
pression of sadness upon his face that seemed to&#xD;
be abiding, and to derive itself from a source&#xD;
deeply hidden in the heart. With all his beauty,&#xD;
there was a total absence of consciousness of it,&#xD;
and with all his womanly elegance there was no&#xD;
tack of the proud and manly bearing of his ex.&#xD;
Between him and the earl there appeared to 'u-&#xD;
l t a friendship equal and confidential, alnd&#xD;
which seemed to take no daunt of the diffetase&#xD;
in their years. The attire of the young secretary&#xD;
was a suit of black vbvet, with here and there&#xD;
plain gold button, and a silver hilted sword.&#xD;

The Earl Villiers then took a pen in his left&#xD;

there to give him my homage, in which case I&#xD;

education is by this time well on to its close ;&#xD;

be the bearer of this, and I would fain commend&#xD;
him (here there lurked a smiling expression in&#xD;
the coiner of the earl's eye) to thy courtesy and&#xD;
attention, for lie bath my confidence and love.&#xD;
Heaven bless thee, fair daughter Jenny, and&#xD;
soon place thee in the arms of thy loving father,&#xD;
AnrTnU, EARL OF VILLIERS."'&#xD;
This letter having been duly penned by the&#xD;
youthful secretary, Red Hand settled himself&#xD;
upon his couch and gave himself up to the pro-&#xD;
posed sleep which he so much needed, while Ed-&#xD;
ward continued at the escritoire writing and&#xD;
sealing pacquets addressed to various exiled&#xD;
noblemen in France.&#xD;
At length the day broke, and the earl, rising,&#xD;
went to the deck. His keen eye surveyed the&#xD;
horizon. Three or four vessels were-in sight,&#xD;
one of which, far to the eastward, was made out&#xD;
to be a brig-of-war, but as she showed no colors,&#xD;
her nature could not be made out; though as she&#xD;
was near the French coast, she was supposed to&#xD;
be a vessel of that nation. Some dozen fishing&#xD;
vessels were also seen running about. Upon all&#xD;
three Red Hand directed the long, heavy tele-&#xD;
scope of that day, and then, having swept the&#xD;
French coast near which he was'sailing, he sud-&#xD;
denly gave orders to put about; for up to that&#xD;
time, since Guilferd had left her in the yacht&#xD;
during the preceding night, she had been steering&#xD;
nearly west. The island of Alderney lay about&#xD;
two leagues distant abeam, when they tacked&#xD;
ship-&#xD;
"Lay her coarse E. N. East," said Red Hand.&#xD;
" We will run up the channel and keep crtising&#xD;
between Normandy.and Sussex, for we may l e&#xD;
so fortunate as to fall in with some of the fte$-&#xD;
tives crossing whp will give us news.of the prtta.&#xD;
Keep a close watch on all the fishing boats, pd&#xD;
run close to each of them, so that if any of&#xD;
prince's party be in them, we may take them p1&#xD;
board."&#xD;
The ship now stretched eastwardcinder all as r&#xD;
canvass, for the breeze was light from the sogtk&#xD;
and south by west, and every sail had to W set&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
AN EXCITING SCENE.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT was about three o'clock in the afternoon,&#xD;
when the ship commanded by Red Hand came&#xD;
nearly opposite Cape La Hague, the land lying&#xD;
about five miles from her to the south, on the&#xD;
starboard beam. The wind had been light and&#xD;
baffling all day, and she had made but little&#xD;
progress since the morning, not having placed&#xD;
more than fifteen miles between her and. the&#xD;
place where, at sunrise, she had put about to&#xD;
steer eastward up the channel.&#xD;
The vessels which had been visible from her&#xD;
deck in the morning had now all disappeared in&#xD;
their several directions, but others were in sight.&#xD;
The brig-of-war, which they had supposed to be&#xD;
a French vessel, had suffered the " Prince&#xD;
Charles " to come near enough for her to make&#xD;
out her character, when, without waiting for a&#xD;
more intimate acquaintance, and trusting to her&#xD;
heels, she hoisted the British flag, and ran for&#xD;
Portsmouth. Several fishing vessels, but chiefly&#xD;
Norman, had been brought to in the course of&#xD;
the fifteen miles run, but there was no one on&#xD;
board save the ordinary crews. Nor from two&#xD;
English fishing smacks which Red Hand brought&#xD;
to, could he learn anything of any fugitives hav-&#xD;
ing been seen on the coast, or having crossed to&#xD;
-France.&#xD;
About half past three in the afternoon, as the&#xD;
earl was about to give orders to alter the course&#xD;
of his ship and run into Cherbourg, the lookout&#xD;
aloft called lustily from his perch:&#xD;
"Sail hol"&#xD;
" here away?" demanded the officer of the&#xD;
deck, making use of the same nautical phrase-&#xD;
ology, which, for more than two hundred years,&#xD;
has bein customary in the English navy&#xD;
&#xD;
" Three points abaft the larboard beam."&#xD;
The earl glanced over the quarter, and saw a&#xD;
vessel, at some distance yet, but the appearance&#xD;
of which caused him to call quickly for his tele-&#xD;
scope. When it was handed to him, he rested it&#xD;
upon a rattling of the mizzen rigging and lev-&#xD;
eied it upon the stranger. There were a dozen&#xD;
other vessels in sight in various directions, but&#xD;
they were all made out to be either traders or&#xD;
coasters and fishermen, save one, which was to&#xD;
the north and east, whioh could not be made out,&#xD;
being too remote, but which seemed to be coming&#xD;
down hand over hand, bringing a fine topsail&#xD;
breeze along with her.&#xD;
" What do you make her out, my lord ?" aske&#xD;
Edward, who stood near the earl, assisting i:&#xD;
one arm in keeping the glass steady.&#xD;
" A confounded large ship, and with iron&#xD;
teeth enough to eat two such mouthfuls as we&#xD;
are."&#xD;
" A ship of the largest class, my lord ?"&#xD;
" Yes, and one of Ci'omwell's bull-dogs. I&#xD;
know her well, by her stump topmasts. It is&#xD;
the Leviathan, and is twice our metal. She has&#xD;
a breeze with her, too, and seems to he st-riag&#xD;
dead for us."&#xD;
" You may be sure, my lord, she knows who&#xD;
we are."&#xD;
" Without doubt. We have boarded craft&#xD;
enough since morning to report us in that&#xD;
quarter."&#xD;
"My lord," said the quartermaster, wl o had&#xD;
been for some minutes inspecting the ship in the&#xD;
northern board."&#xD;

calling out manfully to the prince :&#xD;
" Keep up heart, my royal master! A few&#xD;
seconds more and we will reach you! Down&#xD;
with the boats, but first for me !" he added.&#xD;
The warlike, castellated ship now got within&#xD;
her length of the smaclk, 'when the earl sprang&#xD;
into a boat alongside, and pulled by a dozen&#xD;
strong arms, the next moment had the prince's&#xD;
hand in his, and cew him from the foundering&#xD;
fishing vessel into his own barge. Instantly lie&#xD;
dropped on his knee before him, and with tears&#xD;
in his eyes kissed his hands.&#xD;
" 0, my prince ! my escaped, my beloved and&#xD;
royal Charles !" The air at the same tine was&#xD;
rent with huzzas for Prince Charles, and for a&#xD;
few moments it seemed as if every man in the&#xD;
boats and on the ship were beside themselves.-&#xD;
Some shouted, some wept, some huzzaed, some&#xD;
danced over the decks, others embraced, and all&#xD;
was joy and glad uproar.&#xD;

&#xD;
Escorted by the earl, Prince Charles ascended&#xD;
the side of the ship, and then every officer&#xD;
pressed around him, knelt before him, and em-&#xD;
braced him, weeping like children. Charles&#xD;
himself could scarcely see for the emotions that&#xD;
blinded his own eyes with tears. He recognized&#xD;
this one and that one, and called them by name,&#xD;
and kissed on the check some of those whom he&#xD;
had once known most intimately.&#xD;
" Now, your highness;" said Red Hand, whose&#xD;
war-worn cheeks were wet with tears of delight,&#xD;
"let me lead thee to my cabin."&#xD;
" Nay, not till I have presented to thee and all&#xD;
my friends the brave young man to whom I owe&#xD;
my escape from England. Where is he ?"&#xD;
The prince then looked around for Guilford&#xD;
and also for Robin, but was told they were in&#xD;
the smack, which some of the sailors were aiding&#xD;
them in saving from sinking. He then called to&#xD;
him to leave the boat and come on board.&#xD;

THE YOUNG FI§HERtMAN               U&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
&#xD;
A NEW DANGER--RED HAND's DEVOTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
WiEN Guilford, in obedience to the command&#xD;
of the prince, came over the ship's side, and the&#xD;
eyes of the Earl Red Hand fell upon him, the&#xD;
latter exclaimed with surprise and pleasure:&#xD;
- " What ! dost thou owe thy secure flight from&#xD;
the shores of Britain to this young man, your&#xD;
majesty ?"&#xD;
"Yes; and never will I forget my obligations&#xD;
to him. Advance, master Guilford, and let me&#xD;
present thee as my deliverer to these my noble&#xD;
friends."&#xD;
" By the rood, sir Guilford !" said the earl, as&#xD;
he warmly grasped his hand, " thou art in luck.&#xD;
Thy star is in the ascendant. Thou art the most&#xD;
fortunate man born ! Come, thou shalt tell&#xD;
me how it has been thy fortune to be of such&#xD;
service to England's king."&#xD;
"My lord," said Edward, who had already&#xD;
exchanged a grasp of the hand with Guilford,&#xD;
" the men in the boats wish to know if they shall&#xD;
save the poor devils who are swimming about&#xD;
the ship ?"&#xD;
" What," exclaimed the prince, " the wretches&#xD;
thrown into the water by the explosion of the&#xD;
frigate ?"&#xD;
" Yes, your highness," answered Red Hand.&#xD;
a By all means ! pick them up to a man, and&#xD;
be diligent ! They are all my British subjects.&#xD;
You have room for them, my good Villiers ?"&#xD;
" Yes, your majesty, as prisoners," answered&#xD;
Red Hand, with a slight cloud upon his brow.&#xD;
"But I have little favor towards the villains who&#xD;
have placed my prince's life in jeopardy."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Let that pass ! We must be humane, my&#xD;
dear earl. But what ship have we standing&#xD;
down so bravely this way ?"&#xD;
" That is a parliament war vessel, your majes-&#xD;
ty," answered Red Hand, who had been so much'&#xD;
occupied with the rescue and reception of the&#xD;
prince as to be heedless of the approach of this&#xD;
vessel, until now she was within a league, and&#xD;
booming down upon them under all her enor-&#xD;
mous spread of canvass.&#xD;
Red Hand, having escorted the prince to his&#xD;
cabin, and ordered refreshments at once to be&#xD;
placed before him and the two noblemen, has-&#xD;
tened from his presence, and ascending the&#xD;
highest part of the stern, called Edward to his&#xD;
side.&#xD;
"Place the telescope in rest here, and let me&#xD;
have a sight at this monster, for I begin to fear,&#xD;
that the prince, now that he is on board of us,&#xD;
would be safer any where else."&#xD;
" There is great danger, my lord," answered&#xD;
Edward. "She is certainly coming on us fast&#xD;
since we stopped to take the prince on board."&#xD;
" Yes, that she is, and she is already train-'&#xD;
ing her guns upon us. Make all sail !" he shout-&#xD;
ed, like the tones of a battle trumpet. " Every&#xD;
man to his post ! Boats, aboard ! If there are&#xD;
any more men to be picked up, let the ship&#xD;
astern look after them. Cast overboard a dozen&#xD;
spars for the miserable wretches to float on !&#xD;
Sail all! We must save the prince from cap-&#xD;
ture !"&#xD;
At the sound of his ringing commands all&#xD;
&#xD;
0&#xD;
SLY&#xD;
" Yt&#xD;

Y&#xD;
&#xD;
was activity from stem to stern. The boats&#xD;
were hoisted up, apd Robin had theregret to see&#xD;
his smack, to which no repairs could be made,&#xD;
drop astern, and at length slowly disappear be-&#xD;
neath the tide.&#xD;
But all that the good ship could do, she could&#xD;
not make her way beyond reach of the Levia-&#xD;
than's long guns, one of which was now fired&#xD;
upon her at the farthest range.' The shot fell&#xD;
astern a quarter of a mile; but the second shot,&#xD;
which soon followed, dropped into the ship's&#xD;
wake.&#xD;
" The game is up," said the earl. " It will not&#xD;
do for the prince to stay half an hour longer on&#xD;
board, for that ship will blow me out of the wa-&#xD;
ter, unless I can work to windward, and then it&#xD;
is doubtful if we can get away from her."&#xD;
This was spoken to a group of officers whom&#xD;
he had called around him on the deck, while the&#xD;
prince was regaling himself with the wines and&#xD;
acceptable fare he had placed before him.&#xD;
" We are caught in this bay of Havre de&#xD;
Grace, and must either run ashore or fight."&#xD;
"It would be madness, my lord, to fight such&#xD;
a ship, twice our size," said his officers.&#xD;
"I know it. My mind is made up. We must&#xD;
let the prince go. There is the little village of&#xD;
Feschamps under our lee, not five miles distant.&#xD;
And there flies a French fisherman straight into&#xD;
the port. Fire a gun forward, and bring the&#xD;
boat to."&#xD;
The order was no sooner given than obeyed,&#xD;
and a small fly-sail boat with one mast, which&#xD;
was darting over the water, landward, like a&#xD;
swallow on the wing, suddenly lowering its tri-&#xD;
angular sail, waited- the approach of the ship.--&#xD;
In the meanwhile, the earl entered the cabin&#xD;
where the prince was at his repast with his two&#xD;
friends.&#xD;
'"This is a feast, my dear earl, fit to set be-&#xD;
fore a king," said the prince, laughing. "Ihave&#xD;
not dined so well in many a day. By the rood !&#xD;
if you keep us so well here in your castle of the&#xD;
sea, we shall be induced to be long your guest."&#xD;
"Gladly would I have your majesty my guest&#xD;
as long as it may please you to honor my poor&#xD;
vessel with your royal presence. But I regret&#xD;
to say that I have, come, your majesty, to warn&#xD;
you that you are not safe even here, though you&#xD;
are surrounded with brave hearts and'loyal; but&#xD;
these may bleed for you, but they cannot protect&#xD;
you against the foe that menaces your safety."&#xD;
" What now? Have I to fly again so' soon,&#xD;
my dear earl?' said the prince, with a slight&#xD;
&#xD;
shade of discontent on his brow. "I was in,&#xD;
dulging the hope that for a day or two I should&#xD;
find here repose and quiet."&#xD;
"So I hoped, your highness. Please cast your&#xD;
eyes out of the -stern window, and you will see&#xD;
one of the largest of Cromwell's ships in chase&#xD;
of us. Itwill be impossible for me to cope with&#xD;
so formidable an antagonist ; and I have come&#xD;
to beg your majesty to take refuge on board a&#xD;
French fishing vessel now alongside."&#xD;
"I am in your hands, my dear earl and my&#xD;
lords," answered the prince, rising. "But to&#xD;
whom am I to entrust myself?"&#xD;
" Two Frenchmen,-an old man and a boy,&#xD;
your highness."                      , A&#xD;
"I will take with me my two trusty English&#xD;
friends, Graham and Robin; with themI shall&#xD;
feel secure."&#xD;
Upon reaching the gangway, the prince asked&#xD;
Guilford if he would still accompany him and&#xD;
see him safely on French ground.&#xD;
Our young hero very joyfully complied with&#xD;
the prince's wish, and at the same time with the&#xD;
prince, the two lords who had come with him,&#xD;
got into the fishing boat. Edward also made&#xD;
one of the party, laden with the pacquets with&#xD;
which the earl had entrusted him.&#xD;
"Now farewell, my brave earl, and my lords&#xD;
and gentlemen. I hope, if any of you, come to&#xD;
Paris, you will not fail to call on me; and I&#xD;
trust Heaven will one day send us all better for-&#xD;
tunes."&#xD;
. With this courteous parting speech, the prince&#xD;
raised and waved his chapeau to the officers and&#xD;
also to the men, who crowded the rigging and&#xD;
bulwarks to see him depart. The earl lingered&#xD;
on board the French boat last of all, and having&#xD;
embraced the prince, he extended his hand to&#xD;
Guilford.&#xD;
" I see you need no aid from me, my brave&#xD;
young friend. If the prince comes to his own,&#xD;
you will go up with him,-that I can prophesy&#xD;
without being a prophet."&#xD;
The fishing boat was now cast off from the&#xD;
side of the ship, and Guilford, by the command&#xD;
of Prince Charles, took the helm from the old&#xD;
Norman fisherman, who all the while had re'&#xD;
garded with a sort of bewilderment this sum-&#xD;
mary disposition, of his little vessel.&#xD;
" Where will you land,, my prince " asked&#xD;
Guilford, as he took the helm.&#xD;
" What-village is that in the bottom of the&#xD;
bay south of us1?"&#xD;
-"Feschsamps, your majesty l"&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
TiHE PRINCE'S STAR IN THE ASCENDANT.&#xD;
&#xD;
TuE earl and his officers were hospitably en- ti&#xD;
tertained that night by the citizens of Cherbourg, i&#xD;
vho, when they learned that Prince Charles had tI&#xD;
safely landed in France, illuminated their city n&#xD;
with joy; for the French of all, classes had a t&#xD;
great horror of Cromwell, and although they&#xD;
knew little of Prince Charles, the fact that lie n&#xD;
was the legitimate heir to the British throne, was p&#xD;
enough to bind to him the sympathy of the loyal, b&#xD;
and, in that da , king loving people.s&#xD;
The next day the earl, ivhose renown made U&#xD;
him no inconsiderable mark of curiosity, quittedc&#xD;
Cherbourg for St. Lo, where his daughter, the I&#xD;
-fair Lady Jane, was placed for security and ed- I&#xD;
cation. He was accompanied by several of his&#xD;
officers, who, from thence were to accompany&#xD;
liim to Paris, where they hoped to meet the&#xD;
prince, of whose safe landing at Feschamps thel&#xD;
earl had heard through Edward, who had joined&#xD;
him at Cherbourg.&#xD;
"And what became of my brave friend Guil-&#xD;
ford ?" asked the earl.&#xD;
" He accompanied the prince. by his request, to&#xD;
Paris. I saw them depart, with the youth, and&#xD;
Robin, mounted on horses furnished by the&#xD;
mayor of Feschamps. Lords Algernon and&#xD;
Catesby also accompanied his majesty ; and&#xD;
they hoped to reach Paris in eighteen hours."&#xD;
At St. Lo the earl received his daughter, who&#xD;
joined the cavalcade, and riding more especially&#xD;
under the care of the youthful secretary, she was&#xD;
escorted to the metropolis.&#xD;
The subsequent events connected with the ar-&#xD;
rival of the prince in France, and his retiring&#xD;
and establishing a court inlHolland of the nobles&#xD;
who had followed him, are such common mat-&#xD;
&#xD;
ers of history, that we need not dwell upon them&#xD;
;n our story, but carry our narrative forward to&#xD;
lhe period when the sun of his fortunes onco&#xD;
more rose above the horizon and lighted him to&#xD;
lhe throne of his ancestors.&#xD;
Cromwell, after an unparalleled usurpation of&#xD;
nine years, at length died, contrary to the ex-&#xD;
ectation of his enemies, peacefully upon his&#xD;
bed, and naming his son Richard as his succes-&#xD;
or. But this erson possessed none of the am-&#xD;
bition or statesmanlike talents, or warlike spirit&#xD;
of his father, and after a brief exercise of the&#xD;
power bequeathed to him, resigned it into the&#xD;
hands of a parliament. England was now with-&#xD;
out a head ; and all hearts were turned to the&#xD;
youthful Prince Charles, who still remained in&#xD;
Holland, where he surrounded himself by a bril-&#xD;
liant court. To him a messenger was despatched&#xD;
by the Parliament, offering to reinstate him on&#xD;
the throne of the realm on certain conditions.&#xD;
The prince, when the parliament's courier was&#xD;
announced, was dining at a table, at which were&#xD;
seated a score of his nobles, among whom were&#xD;
lord Algernon, the Scottish lord Catesby, and&#xD;
last, not least, Arthur of the Red Hand, Earl of&#xD;
Villiers.&#xD;
When the prince received the pacquet from&#xD;
the hand of Lord Rudolph, who was the messen-&#xD;
ger, his brow darkened as he perused it, the ex-&#xD;
pression of his face being all the while closely&#xD;
watched by his friends, who forgot the banquet&#xD;
in their anxiety to learn the news from England.&#xD;
But when he came to the close of it, a smile&#xD;
curled his lip.&#xD;
"News from London, my lords! You will&#xD;
excuse me while I withdraw to give a response.&#xD;

He also named four other noblemen, and then&#xD;
rising, he took his leave and departed from the&#xD;
banquet room. Upon reaching his cabinet he&#xD;
closed the door, but first gave orders to have&#xD;
"Lord Rudolph Vane, the courier, hospitably en-&#xD;

"See to it, Guilford !" he paid., turning to our&#xD;
hero, who had left the table with him at his com-&#xD;
mand, and now followed him into the cabinet.&#xD;
" Your majesty could perhaps hardly appoint&#xD;
a less acceptable host to Lord Rudolph," an-&#xD;
swered Guilford, with a slight color of embarrass-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
" True-true! I had forgotten ! My Lord&#xD;
Granville," added the prince, I pray you take&#xD;
care of Lord Vane's comfort. We must not&#xD;

" I obey, your majesty," answered the noble-&#xD;
man, retiring.&#xD;
"Now, my lords," said the king, " hear our&#xD;
words. The brave and loyal General Monk, who&#xD;

bind myself to no conditions to regain that which&#xD;
is lawfully mine. My lords, I will nevertheless&#xD;
advise with you!"&#xD;
" May it please your majesty to read to us&#xD;
such passages of General Monk's letter as may&#xD;
enable us to advise your majesty "&#xD;
"Listen."'--&#xD;
"' Your majesty's restoration is the wish of&#xD;
my breast. That achieved, I am content to lay&#xD;
down all power and retire to private life. I am&#xD;
at the head of an army of ten thousand men. I&#xD;
am encamped near London. I have power to&#xD;
wield the Parliament at my will. As yet they do&#xD;
Clot suspect my intentions, which alone I now&#xD;
reveal to your majesty. If your majesty will&#xD;
consent to the conditions herewith enclosed, I&#xD;
can safely invite your majesty to London, and&#xD;
insure you a public reception that will surpass&#xD;
any public entry of a monarch since the days of&#xD;
the Conqueror. These conditions I know the&#xD;
&#xD;
propose your restoration to this body, I may be&#xD;
able on the spot to shut their months to all oba&#xD;
sections. I despatch my friend Lord Vane as&#xD;
the special bearer of this missive. Do not delay&#xD;
a reply, I entreat your majesty; and I pray do&#xD;
not refuse to comply with conditions, without&#xD;
which I fear the restoration can never be effect-&#xD;
ed. The hearts of the people are with your&#xD;
majesty;&#xD;
"Now, my lords, here are the conditions."&#xD;
The prince then read from a paper enclosed&#xD;
in the letter the conditions which history has&#xD;
made familiar to every reader.&#xD;
" You perceive, my friends," he said, when he&#xD;
had concluded, " what chains they would shackle&#xD;
us with!'&#xD;
" Nay, your majesty," said the earl; " but rath-&#xD;
er with what rivets they would strengthen your&#xD;
throne !"&#xD;
" Ha ! think you that way, my lord I'&#xD;
"I do, your majesty. The people no doubt&#xD;
would receive you without conditions. But the&#xD;
Parliament must be humored."&#xD;
"I will truckle to none of them!"&#xD;
"Nay, your majesty, but something must be&#xD;
yielded on account of the disjointed state of the&#xD;
times, and the imperfections of men's loyalty."&#xD;
" Well, you no doubt counsel wisely. Guil-&#xD;
ford !"&#xD;
" Your majesty," answered the young fisher,&#xD;
man, who stood near an escritoire a little in the&#xD;
rear of the king. He was dressed in a hand',&#xD;
some suit of plum-colored velvet, richly em,&#xD;
broidered, a silken vest and laced doublet, and&#xD;
his hair flowed long and waving upon his shape-&#xD;
ly shoulders. In the interval of two or three&#xD;
years since we last parted with him, a change&#xD;
has been made not only in his appearance but in&#xD;
his position. The prince had become personally&#xD;
attached to him from the day he had assisted in&#xD;
effecting his escape from England, and gave&#xD;
him a position near his own person, as his pri-&#xD;
vate secretary, a situation of responsibility, which&#xD;
Guilford's talents, address, and, thanks to his&#xD;
mother's good education, enabled him to fill&#xD;
with credit and honor. At length he became so&#xD;
useful to the prince, that the latter could hardly&#xD;
bear his absence; and he always consulted him&#xD;
on all matters before bringing them'before his&#xD;
nobles; and after any council, at which Guil-&#xD;
ford was ever present as secretary, he would talk&#xD;
oter with him the debates, and search his opin&#xD;
&#xD;
ions upon what had been discussed. By this inasmuch as our subscription to the terms youlay&#xD;

TEin abrupt departure of the fiery noble&#xD;
caused a momentary excitement. The prince&#xD;
looked displeased. The earl smiled haughtily,&#xD;
and young Edward Percy, recently become Earl&#xD;
of Percy, stole out after the noble.&#xD;
But he had no sooner reached the vestibule,&#xD;
than he saw Lord Rudolph draw his sword, and&#xD;
with the flat of it strike Guilford, who at the&#xD;
moment was walking across the corridor. Our&#xD;
hero had remained a few moments in the cabi-&#xD;
net to seal and address the letter to General&#xD;
Monk, and when he was returning to the hall,&#xD;
he met Lord Rudolph face to face. The latter,&#xD;
the way being narrowed by two columns, on&#xD;
recognizing him, cried:&#xD;
" Stand aside, dog!"&#xD;
Guilford's sword was in his hand, but recollect-&#xD;
ing that he was the brother of Lady Kate, he&#xD;
suppressed his rising resentment, and was pass-&#xD;
ing him, when, as we have said, Lord Rudolph&#xD;
struck him in the face.&#xD;
" Now, by the red rood !" said young Edward&#xD;
Percy, as lie beheld the blow, "if Guilford stand&#xD;
this, he hath caitiff's blood in him indeed!" ,&#xD;
Guilford, however, kept his sword point down,&#xD;
and would have gone by him, when Rudolph&#xD;
spat upon him, accompanying the act with an&#xD;
epithet of derision.&#xD;
The forbearance of our hero was now at an&#xD;
end. He forgot Lady Kate's brother in his own&#xD;
insulter. Throwing himself upon him, he took&#xD;
his sword from him and broke it upon the pave-&#xD;
ment, and then, with the eye of a lion, he glanced&#xD;
upon him with contempt, and was going into&#xD;
the hall, when the prince and several nobles&#xD;
rushed forth, having heard the ecufflea&#xD;
&#xD;
" What means this ? What is this drawing of&#xD;
swords in our very presence ! The person of an&#xD;
ambassador is sacred. Guilford, you are under&#xD;
arrest."&#xD;
" Your majesty," said the young Earl Percy,&#xD;
"Guilford is not to blame. Lord Rudolph in-&#xD;
sulted him, and he bore it ! He then struckhim,&#xD;
and yet lie bore it. He then spat uponb'him, and&#xD;
your secretary took his sword from him and&#xD;
broke it under his feet, as you see there !"&#xD;
"Then it is Lord Rudolph Vane who hath&#xD;
done this discourtesy ?" said the prince, redden-&#xD;
ing with anger. " My lord, I supposed thou&#xD;
hadst come hither to us as a messenger of peace,&#xD;
not a maker of brawls."&#xD;
" I shall not give account of my conduct to&#xD;
one who has neither the right nor the power to&#xD;
exact it," answered Lord Rudolph, haughtily.&#xD;
" This to the prince's face !" exclaimed Earl&#xD;
Percy, with a flashing eye.&#xD;
"Nay, Edward ! We can forgive this rude-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
"I would punish it, your majesty, but that he&#xD;
hath but one hand, and it would not be taking&#xD;
him on fair terms," answered Edward.&#xD;
Lord Rudolph had kept his right arm wrapped&#xD;
in his cloak, a custom  which he had followed&#xD;
ever since his recovery from his wounded wrist.&#xD;
He now thundered back, forgetting that Red&#xD;
Hand was present:&#xD;
"Thou list !"&#xD;
"What ! But we will make thee show thy,&#xD;
self a liar !" retorted Edward, and suddenly&#xD;
tearing from his cloak, he exposed the handless&#xD;
wrist. There was a shout of si-prise from all&#xD;
around ; and Lord Rudolph, with his left hand,&#xD;

THE YOUNG FISHERMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
" And the people at large, do they wish for&#xD;
the prince ?"&#xD;
"Do they ? they would darken the very skies&#xD;
with their caps in the air, if he should come into&#xD;
London to-day. Ah, he is a brave prince, and&#xD;
we all love him. We dare to say so, now Crom-&#xD;
well's day is-gone; but once it was as much as&#xD;
an honest man's head was worth to speak about&#xD;
him.",&#xD;
While Guilford was talking with the commu-&#xD;
nicative and loyal host, there was heard up the&#xD;
street a shouting of men, and then the clangor&#xD;
of a bugle, and a moment afterwards the cry on&#xD;
all sides:&#xD;
" Monk ! Monk ! Here comes the general !"&#xD;
Guilford's blood bounded ! He was more in-&#xD;
terested than all others in his coming, and as he'&#xD;
rode past, accompanied by half a dozen field&#xD;
officers and an orderly or two with a body guard&#xD;
of eighty horse bringing up the rear, he could not&#xD;
but regard with deep interest the man who held&#xD;
the reins of the power of England, not for him-&#xD;
self, but for the prince his master.&#xD;
Without delay lie followed the troop of horse,&#xD;
and at length reached a stately mansion, before&#xD;
which he saw General Monk alight and enter.-&#xD;
He was about to press forward to ascend the&#xD;
steps, when he was put back by a dragoon, who&#xD;
said:&#xD;
" Not so fast, sir cavalier. No one enters&#xD;
here without an order-no they don't."&#xD;
Guilford looked hard in the man's face, for he&#xD;
thought he recognized the voice. But a huge&#xD;
red beard and a fiery moustache defeated at&#xD;
first his scrutiny. But the man himself aided&#xD;
him in the matter, for, after regarding Guilford&#xD;
attentively, he said in a - gratified, chuckling&#xD;
manner:&#xD;
" What ! is not this master Guilford Gra-&#xD;
ham?"&#xD;
" Thou sayest truly," answered Guilford ;&#xD;
" but if thon knowest me, do not speak it out so&#xD;
loudly."   e&#xD;
"And dost thou not know me? I dare say I&#xD;
look too warlike for you to see through me. I&#xD;
am Digby-your old friend Dgby !"&#xD;
"Toby Digby ! Verily, you are nolonger like&#xD;
yourself. Thou a dragoon ?'.&#xD;
" Marry come up ! What would you have a&#xD;
man do! I got my head broke so often by&#xD;
Cromwell's troopers, that I learned the knack o'&#xD;
head breaking myself. So, what with fighting,&#xD;
I got my blood up, and when Monk's sargents&#xD;
came down to our town 'listing, Jwas one o' the&#xD;
&#xD;
first to enlist. It is a brave life, so long as w&#xD;
don't have any fighting. But, bless us ! they&#xD;
say you are with Prince Charles over the sea,&#xD;
and he has made a lord of you !"&#xD;
" The prince can hardly make lords where he&#xD;
is, honest Digby. I am glad to see thee such a&#xD;
changed man, and doing so well."'&#xD;
" What art thou doing in England, master&#xD;
Guilford ?"&#xD;
"I would see General Monk.. Can you let&#xD;
me pass, for old companion's sake ?"&#xD;
" Marry, that will I. Go in ; and when thou,&#xD;
bast done thine errand, wait till I am off guard,&#xD;
and we'll have a rare gossip o' bygones."  -&#xD;
With these words the trooper drew aside, and&#xD;
let Guilford pass. Going by several officers who&#xD;
stood in the hall, he came to an orderly, who&#xD;
stood near an inner door, and said that he de-&#xD;
sired to have a word of importance with the&#xD;
general.&#xD;
" Your name ?"&#xD;
"It is of no consequence. Say I have letters&#xD;
to him from France."&#xD;
Upon hearing this, there was a murmur in the&#xD;
hall, of surprise and expectation from the mili-&#xD;
tary men and others in waiting, and Guilford&#xD;
was scrutinized with curiosity.&#xD;
" A messenger from France ! A courier from&#xD;
the prince !" went buzzing from lip to lip.&#xD;
" His excellency desires to see you," said the&#xD;
orderly, re-appearing after a moment's absence,&#xD;
Guilford, all travel-worn as he was, entered&#xD;
the apartment of the commander-in-chief of the&#xD;
army. The general bent his eyes upon him as&#xD;
he came towards him, and then said courteously,&#xD;
yet with animation :&#xD;
"Did I understand my orderly aright ? Do&#xD;
you bring letters from France ?"&#xD;
" Yes, your excellency, from the prince."&#xD;
"From his majesty ! exclaimed the general,&#xD;
with a look of pleasure. "But how is this?&#xD;
Where is Lord Rudolph Vane ?'&#xD;
" He arrived, and placed your letters in the&#xD;
prince's hands, but when the reply, which I now&#xD;
bear, was ready, he got into some altercation&#xD;
with some of the nobles and others, and gave&#xD;
some offence to the prince, who entrusted the&#xD;
letters to me, who hold the place of his private&#xD;
secretary."&#xD;
" You are then Sir Guilford Graham ?"&#xD;
" At your excellency's service," answered our&#xD;
hero, as he placed the pacque, which he had by'&#xD;
this time unbuckled from his girdle, in the gen-&#xD;

THE YOUNG FISHERMAN,&#xD;
&#xD;
mur of approbation ran through the cathedral.&#xD;
The history of Guilford was well known, and a&#xD;
thousand eyes sought to rest on the face of one&#xD;
who had risen from a humble fisher's boy to be&#xD;
the confidant of his king and the peer of lords&#xD;
of the realm. In height, in comeliness of air, in&#xD;
commanding person, there was no high-born&#xD;
baron of them all who were present who sur-&#xD;
passed him.&#xD;
The king himself gave away the bride, and at&#xD;
the conclusion of the benediction by the venera-&#xD;
ble Archbishop of Canterbury, the sacredness of&#xD;
the place did not wholly suppress very animated&#xD;
applauses and hearty wishes for their happiness.&#xD;
We have now come to the close of our story.&#xD;
For further information of events that followed&#xD;
these times, our renders are referred to the pages&#xD;
of history. As a romancer, we have taken but a&#xD;
page out of its records, in which we have endeav-&#xD;
ored to show that virtue, honor, probity and&#xD;
courage, rightly directed by laudable ambition,&#xD;
will bring a man to the highest pinnacle of his&#xD;
wishes; and that to succeed in life, it is not&#xD;
necessary to mark our path with guilt, or mar it&#xD;
with dishonesty. The right will always come&#xD;
right in the end, and ends sought through wrong&#xD;
doings will prove evil instead of good.&#xD;
If our readers should ever visit the little fish-&#xD;
ing town of Brithelmstone, in Sussex, the ruins&#xD;
of the Castle Vane may recall to their recollec-&#xD;
tions this story. If they inquire for the descend-&#xD;
ants of Lord Vane, they will be pointed to Astley&#xD;
&#xD;
Castle, a mile in the interior, where lives the&#xD;
present Earl of Astley, the lineal descendant of&#xD;
Guilford Graham, the first earl of that name.&#xD;
Over the gateway it will be seen that the arms&#xD;
are a tower with two oars crossed, and the motto&#xD;
"LOYAL EN TOUT."&#xD;
At the foot of the ruins of Castle Vane is an&#xD;
ancient stone cottage, which any one will tell&#xD;
you, if you inquire, is "King Charles's cottage."&#xD;
If you go to the door and ask why itis so called,&#xD;
a stout fisherman in the yard mending his nets&#xD;
will answer, that many a year ago, in "the old&#xD;
Parliament times," the Prince Charles was hid&#xD;
there one night before he got away across the&#xD;
channel. If you ask the man his name, he will&#xD;
tell you that it is Robin Rengivell, and that he is&#xD;
a descendant, in the eighth generation, from&#xD;
Robin and Anne Rengivell, who dwelt there in&#xD;
the Parliament days, and Robin was one who&#xD;
aided the king's escape.&#xD;
If you go into the little graveyard, you will&#xD;
see a sunken grave-stone in one corner, on which,&#xD;
with difficulty, you may decipher as follows:&#xD;
" Here lyeth ye body of Toby Digby, who&#xD;
died fighting valiantly for his king and country&#xD;
Peace to his ashes."&#xD;
The descendants of Earl Red Hand are still&#xD;
among the noblest of England's aristocracy, and&#xD;
it is an inexplicable characteristic of the race&#xD;
that every eldest son of the progressive genera-&#xD;
tions is born with a distinct impress of a min-&#xD;
iature red hand upon the inside of the left palm&#xD;

commission of the crime. I am guilty of only&#xD;
two robberies, which I might never have con-&#xD;
fessed, hadit not been for the sake of this fair&#xD;
girl. I restore your money untouched ; for my&#xD;
whole nature shrank from the thought of appro-&#xD;
priating it to my own or my daughter's use. I&#xD;
shall go to America, and it is probable I shall&#xD;
see you no more. Iva, with ,you I leave the&#xD;
most precious. of all earthly things-my only&#xD;
child."&#xD;
SKarl's voice grew tremulous, and he was&#xD;
obliged to pause.&#xD;
" My only child!1 Iva, you will be kind to her.&#xD;
Conceal from her, as you value your soul's hap.&#xD;
piness, the knowledge of her father's crime."&#xD;
Karl Deman waited for no reply. He turned&#xD;
on his heel and left the house to return no more.&#xD;
As he passed out of the room, Hans saw Iva'!&#xD;
a father put a well-filled purse into his hand, a&#xD;
into his face a moment, and in a broken v6iti4&#xD;
lsay.&#xD;
"Farewell, Karl. God bless you."&#xD;
" What a fortunate thing that my horse stu-&#xD;

Occasionally a faint whisper of this would 11"marry in haste, to repent at his leisure."&#xD;
&#xD;
'Twas true, Mary Maurice was just the un- thi&#xD;
assuming person theyhad styled her; there was M&#xD;
more practice than poetry in her everyday life, he&#xD;
and in- the performance of her Christian duties ga&#xD;
there was no needless or ostentatious show, but&#xD;
her motto seemed to be, " Let not thy right hand G&#xD;
know what thy left hand doeth." "&#xD;
She found but little time to assist in the lead- he&#xD;
ing objects of the day, confined as she was at 'ti&#xD;
home by the care of her invalid mother, but to&#xD;
many .of God's suffering children she had been st&#xD;
as an angel of mercy, and many a widowed ro&#xD;
mother's and orphaned child's heart had been th&#xD;
made to rejoice through her instrumentality, and gi&#xD;
indeed, she was admirably qualified to fill the ai&#xD;
station to which she was looking forward.  h&#xD;
As time sped on, the breach between-the vi&#xD;
young pastor and a part of his flock, instead of&#xD;
closing, seemedto widen, and so artful had been kstatw&#xD;
several of his friends had joined them, and this, t&#xD;
caused him unhappiness.                   d&#xD;
Among the most zealous of his opponents, o&#xD;
was Aunt Hetty, the village gossip, who delight- b&#xD;
ed in slander and news-bearing, and any affairs I.&#xD;
that did not relate to these, were looked upon as b&#xD;
things of minor importance, as was plainly to be s&#xD;
seen by the interior of her dwelling, where hern&#xD;
breakfast table might be often seen standing till-&#xD;
noon, and then, on her " dear Josey's " return&#xD;
from his labor, he was obliged to content himself r&#xD;
with what few cold bits he might chance to find,c&#xD;
while she was going from house to house, vend-s&#xD;
ing her "little talk'" by the wholesale.&#xD;
The sewing circle had met on a Saturday&#xD;
afternoon, as was their practice, and while the 1&#xD;
rest of the company were plying their needles,&#xD;
Mary Maurice was reading aloud to entertain&#xD;
them.&#xD;
" Excuse me for interrupting you, Mary," said&#xD;
Ann Hart, who sat by the open window, "but I&#xD;
see the 'village express '-the name by which&#xD;
Aunt Hletty was familiarly known-coming&#xD;
across the street, and she is looking up as though&#xD;
she were coming here, and she has a world of&#xD;
news to tell, for her mouth is wide open."&#xD;
"The wicked, unprincipled creature !" said&#xD;
Julia Lane, who, by the way, had had many a&#xD;
spicy chat with the gossip, but did not care to-&#xD;
have it known. " I think we had best give her to&#xD;
understand that 'her room is much better than&#xD;
her company,' if she comes in."&#xD;
" Very true," said Mrs. Lane, looking up from&#xD;
her sewing approvingly at her daughter. "I&#xD;
&#xD;
ink that the best thing that can be done, is for&#xD;
iss Maurice to continue her reading without&#xD;
eding her, and we will all be very busily en-&#xD;
ged with our work."&#xD;
"0 , that will be too bad 1" exclaimed Eunice&#xD;
rey, a merry, laughing-eyed girl of sixteen.-&#xD;
I do love to hear the dear old soul talk about&#xD;
r Josey, and what she ' took and told him,'&#xD;
s so funny ; but here she is, at the door."&#xD;
Creak, creak, creak, came Aunt Hetty up the&#xD;
eps, and through the hall, and entering the -&#xD;
om without ceremony, she threw herself upon&#xD;
e first unoccupied chair, and taking off her&#xD;
reen calash, laid it upon the floor by her side,&#xD;
nd with the air of one quite at home, took her&#xD;
andkerchief and commenced fanning  herself&#xD;
violently, saying:&#xD;
"La me, 'tis desperit rarm out if ye did but&#xD;
:nowd it. 0, deary, what a wicked place this&#xD;
orld is, aint it?" she continued, not appearing&#xD;
o notice their evident disregard of her; "'tis&#xD;
readfully so, dreadfully! Trewly the language&#xD;
f the scriptur is verified, 'How has the fine gold&#xD;
ecome dim.' Who would a' thought it, on him?&#xD;
never liked him any tew well, though I wouldn't&#xD;
leeve sich dreadful things on him, if I hadn't a'&#xD;
eed um with my own eyes. Trewly, wicked-&#xD;
ness stalks forth in high places. 0 dear, 0 dear,&#xD;
what are we all coming tew ?"&#xD;
Insensibly the book had fallen from Mary&#xD;
Maurice's hand, and the greater part of the&#xD;
company's eyes were fixed upon Aunt Hetty, as&#xD;
she swayed to and fro on her seat, occasionally&#xD;
groaning audibly.&#xD;
"I don't know but it will be as well for you&#xD;
to ask her, mother, what it is she alludes to, for&#xD;
it is evident it is something more than common&#xD;
from her appearance," said Julia Lane, in a&#xD;
suppressed tone.&#xD;
" Yes. daughter, under existing circumstances,&#xD;
I think it will be," said Mrs. Lane, with an elon-&#xD;
gated countenance. " What is it, Aunt Hetty,&#xD;
that seems to trouble you so much "&#xD;
" 0, the sin," said Aunt Hetty, " the unright-&#xD;
eousness that there is on the airth ; 'tis truly sur-&#xD;
prising; but before I begin my dreadful story,&#xD;
July, take and git me a leetle drop o'-water,&#xD;

an opportunity of tantalizing them for her cool&#xD;
reception.&#xD;
"'Tis most tew dreadful tew tell; but now I've&#xD;

Sick? Well, arter stayin' there quite a while, to weight upon his spirits, and with a heavy heart&#xD;
comfort the poor creatur, I took and started for he entered the desk. His face wore a haggard&#xD;
home; and I hadn't got but a leetle way, afore expression, which did not escape the notice of&#xD;
I seed a body ahead on me that looked jest like his hearers, for many an earnest and inquiring&#xD;
the preacher. Well, I thought he walked mighty glance was cast upon him. His sermon was&#xD;
curis ; fust he staggered one way, and then pronounced by all to be the poorest one he had&#xD;
t'other. So I hurried as fast as ever I could, and ever preached, and of this fact he was well&#xD;
when I got nigh enough, I found 'twas he for aware ; he knew that it was lacking in spirit and&#xD;

THE VILLAGE GOSSIP.                95&#xD;
&#xD;
to speak of an affair of momentous importance pi&#xD;
to all on us. We are brought to a critical pe- of&#xD;
riod, perhaps more critical in many senses of the I&#xD;
word, than any other within our remembrance- ri&#xD;
hem-hem. Without doubt you all know what ti&#xD;
I allewd to, and marters and things in gineral n&#xD;
have transpire to make us conclude that the re- t&#xD;
port about our minister is not totally without l&#xD;
foundation; and now we have met to conclude a&#xD;
what is best to be done in regard to this ex- I&#xD;
ceedingly unfort'nate affair, and we hope that p&#xD;
none will be slow in expressin' their opinion of b&#xD;
this marter; and though there's much on my h&#xD;
mind I'd like to say, I give place to some of my&#xD;
brethren.. Brother . Hinds, what's your mind t&#xD;
'bout this affair? I hope you'll express it freely,&#xD;
and not be afeared of offendin' the people."&#xD;
" Truly we ought not to be men-servers,"c&#xD;
said Brother Hinds, rising with deep solemnity&#xD;
depicted upon his countenance; " truly, we t&#xD;
ought not to be, and as you all well know, Is&#xD;
never did have no great opinion of our preacher.f&#xD;
I never have liked him any too well since that&#xD;
Sabbath he appeared out in that flaunting vestc&#xD;
and a light coat-quite different from our good&#xD;
old parson Moody, who used to wear his snuff-q&#xD;
colored suit and white cravat, aluz tred jest so,&#xD;
from year's end to year's end. But the dear&#xD;
soul has gone to his rest, and we never shall see&#xD;
his like, no, never," he continued, drawing his&#xD;
handkerchief across his eyes. " But I fear I am&#xD;
- occupying too much time, and in closing, I'll&#xD;
speak right out what I think. I reely am&#xD;
obleeged to believe every word of the story, and&#xD;
think the quicker we dismiss him, the sooner."&#xD;
" I agree with you there," said Mr. Silas Gree-&#xD;
ley; "I've no opinion of our preacher, and I&#xD;
think he aint none too good, and I've aluz&#xD;
thought so. I can't think of nothin' but that&#xD;
passage of scripter-Vanity of - vanities, saith&#xD;
the preacher man, all is vanity-when I look at&#xD;
him. I don't think there's much religion in&#xD;
sporting a great bunch of gold watch-seals, now&#xD;
I don't, and I told my Sukey as how I didn't,&#xD;
the very fast time I iver seed him. I aint no&#xD;
opinion of these new-fangled notions no how&#xD;
you can fix it, I aint."&#xD;
" I do not see, brethren," said an elderly, be-&#xD;
nign looking gentleman, rising, "as you have&#xD;
really brought anything of momentous import&#xD;
against our young preacher, except the charge&#xD;
that brought us together; and I, for one, am&#xD;
disposed to regard it with some small degree of&#xD;
leniency; for when have we had a more faithful&#xD;
&#xD;
astor 4 Has he ever overlooked us in the hours&#xD;
if our affliction ? Have his discourses been&#xD;
asking in spirituality or depth? Has he ever&#xD;
refused to assist the poor and needy? I admit&#xD;
hat the fault brought against him is of a dark&#xD;
ature, but then we are all more or less prone&#xD;
o step aside from the path of duty ; therefore,&#xD;
et us be lenient to our young and erring brother,&#xD;
*nd instead of discarding him, assist him to rise.&#xD;
The course we now pursue may be the turning&#xD;
point with him. Say, are there not some of my&#xD;
rethren who will join with me in saying, give&#xD;
him one more trial ?"&#xD;
"Do you think to get my consent to sit under&#xD;
he preachin' of a drunkard ?" said Deacon&#xD;
Goodman, fairly trembling with anger. "I&#xD;
wont listen to his sinful pratin', not even for&#xD;
one Sabbath; that's for sartin' !"&#xD;
I will not stay to repeat more of the conversa-&#xD;
tion, lest I trespass upon the patience of my&#xD;
reader; but suffice it to say, that ere they sep-&#xD;
arated, it was fully decided that the connection&#xD;
between them and Herman Stanwood should be&#xD;
dissolved.&#xD;
Herman wondered why it was that he had re-&#xD;
ceived so few calls during the week from his&#xD;
parishioners, and as he bent his steps to the&#xD;
dwelling of 'Squire Maurice, on Friday, he de-&#xD;
termined in his mind to make some inquiries of&#xD;
Mary, who, he felt sure, would tell him all she&#xD;
knew of the affair. He was met at the door by the&#xD;
'Squire, who coldly informed him that Mary was&#xD;
not to be seen, and his visits henceforth could be&#xD;
dispensed with. He could not have been more&#xD;
surprised had the earth opened at his feet, and&#xD;
with a bewildered and aching heart, he, hastily&#xD;
returned to his apartment; but the longer he&#xD;
mused upon the singularity of the affair, the&#xD;
more dark and mysterious it seemed, and bow-&#xD;
ing before Him who knoweth the secrets of all&#xD;
hearts, he poured forth his full soul, and arose&#xD;
refreshed and strengthened, fully prepared to&#xD;
meet with resignation the worst that might be-&#xD;
fall him.&#xD;
On the ensuing Sabbath, as he entered his&#xD;
desk, and his eye fell upon the deserted seats, he&#xD;
was enabled to say, " Thy will, 0 Father, not&#xD;
mine, be done ; I wait for thy bidding."&#xD;
The story spread rapidly, and though there&#xD;
were some who did not doubt his innocence,&#xD;
there seemed to be no possible method of prov-&#xD;
ing this, and in course of time, his connection&#xD;
with the church was dissolved, and with aheavy&#xD;
heart, he turned from the place that had become&#xD;

&#xD;
endeared to him by many fond associations, to r&#xD;
return to his father's roof, an altered man; for l&#xD;
where now were the buoyant hopes which had f&#xD;
inspired him on his arrival at L--? Allc&#xD;
cruelly crushed by the fell breath of slander!&#xD;
As the lumbering coach passed the dwelling of&#xD;
'Squire Maurice, he cast his eyes towards theta&#xD;
house, hoping to catch one parting glimpse ofV&#xD;
Mary, but in this he was disappointed. If her&#xD;
could have but heard from her lips the assurances&#xD;
of her belief in his innocence, it would have been&#xD;
as a cordial to his aching bosom; but he had&#xD;
not seen her since the day her father requested.&#xD;
him to discontinue his visits, nor had one word&#xD;
from her reached his hearing; for 'Squire Mau-I&#xD;
rice was a stern man, and had forbidden her inI&#xD;
any way communicating, either by word or letter,&#xD;
with the young ' scape-grace," as he termed him,&#xD;
and poor Mary was obliged'to stifle all her sor-&#xD;
rows within her own breast, and each day her&#xD;
check grew paler and paler, and her step&#xD;
heavier.&#xD;
A new minister was called, to supply Her-&#xD;
man's place-a benevolent and warm-hearted&#xD;
man, and a devout Christian. The second year&#xD;
of his labors witnessed a copious outpouring of&#xD;
the spirit, and among the inquirers was Sam&#xD;
Snell, who my reader will doubtless remember.&#xD;
Many wondered what it was that kept him so&#xD;
long out of the kingdom, for he seemed willing&#xD;
to give up all,-but he and his Maker alone&#xD;
viewed the hindering cause. It was not until&#xD;
after many a painful struggle that he conquered&#xD;
his pride sufficiently to request a private inter-&#xD;
view with his pastor, and revealed to him the&#xD;
part he took in the affairs of Herman Stanwood.&#xD;
He freely admitted his innocence, stating that&#xD;
when he came into his shop he was so faint that&#xD;
it was with difficulty that he could support him-&#xD;
self, and as he had nothing in the shop save ar-&#xD;
dent spirits, lie urged it upon him ; that he re-&#xD;
fused, but at length was induced to take it ; and&#xD;
that he and his comrade had for some time owed&#xD;
the young pastor a grudge for reproving them in&#xD;
their evil courses, and they seized upon this&#xD;
means to repay it, and, to his sorrow, it needed&#xD;
not to be told how successful it had been.&#xD;
Several months after the circumstance last&#xD;
&#xD;
'elated, had one looked into Aunt Hetty's dwel-&#xD;
ing, they might have seen her swaying to and&#xD;
ro in her straight, high-backed chair, as was her&#xD;
custom when deeply engaged in thought.&#xD;
" Who'd ever thought it ?" she at length said,&#xD;
'that parson Stanwood would ever a' come back&#xD;
to preach to us agin. I raley think he's the for-&#xD;
givinest man that ever was; and they aint done&#xD;
none too much for him, to fix up the white cot-&#xD;
tage in the lane and furnish it so smart and&#xD;
tidy. It does my old heart good to look at Ma-&#xD;
ry Maurice sense he's got back ; why, she looks&#xD;
like another gal, and I took and told her so&#xD;
t'other day, and how the sweet creetur blushed.&#xD;
I raly think I was tew blame about spreading'&#xD;
that story that made um send away poor Mr.&#xD;
Stanwood ; and if the gal had pined herself to&#xD;
death-an' I thought my soul she would-I&#xD;
should a' felt awfully-awfully indeed ! I'm so&#xD;
sorry 'bout it ; but it can't be helped now; but I&#xD;
-guess the next time Hitty Mason gits caught so&#xD;
aging will be a long spell from now. It's been a&#xD;
good lesson, and truly, I am led to say, ' The&#xD;
Lord's ways are a vast deal higher 'an ourn, an'&#xD;
his thoughts are not as our'n are;' and it is for-&#xD;
tunate 'tis so, for if 'twasn't, I'm sure I don't&#xD;
know what on airth we should all come tew ;"&#xD;
and here the old lady raised her glasses and&#xD;
wiped her eyes. "Bless' me ! how's this ?" she&#xD;
continued, " cryin' on sich a joyful occasion as&#xD;
this ? I'm raley ashamed o' myself ; but while I&#xD;
think, on it I'll run an' get that smart calico puff&#xD;
I'm goin' to gin to Mary, and the nice thread&#xD;

Ave Maria, blest be the hour,--Byron,&#xD;
Ave Maria, blest be the hour,&#xD;
When first I heard that solemn strain&#xD;
Float o'er my soul with holy power,&#xD;
To callthe wanderer back again.&#xD;
For years, amid the torrid seas,&#xD;
I've scattered death with sword and fire&#xD;
Till, one sweet night, upon the breeze&#xD;
I heard thy strains, Ave Maria.&#xD;
Then at my soul, hardened by sin,&#xD;
The iron hand of conscience tore;&#xD;
Unclosed, it ali was crime within,&#xD;
I berft beneath the guilt I bore.&#xD;
I strove, by crime, to drown the tones&#xD;
That called me from my downward course;&#xD;
But still in every breeze it moans,&#xD;
Assisted by the fiend, remorse.&#xD;
Ti vain! I cannot escape the cry,&#xD;
The cry of blood oft shed by me;&#xD;
Sin-burthened soul, where can I fly?&#xD;
The corpse-cleft waters rise-and see-&#xD;
&#xD;
The mountain fastness, earth's deep eaves,&#xD;
The forest dense, wont shield my form;&#xD;
And gibbering spirit from the waves&#xD;
Shout "Murderer! canst thou bear the storm?"&#xD;
Ye murdered ones, I cannot, no!&#xD;
I shrink with fear, nor hope for grace;&#xD;
But where, my crimes, where must we gof&#xD;
Has earth for us no hiding-place?&#xD;
No ! list ! on every passing gale,&#xD;
In thunder tones, the answer given,&#xD;
No hope for thee ! Wail, mortal ! wall!&#xD;
No hope on earth, seek hope in heaven!&#xD;
I will-to yonder shore I'll fly,&#xD;
There, buried in yon cloistered pile,&#xD;
Will raise to heaven an endless cry,&#xD;
That grace on penitence may smile.&#xD;
In sternest penance, earnest prayer,&#xD;
My soul shall toil till death shall come ;&#xD;
Then may I pass on evening air,&#xD;
And Ave Maria waft me home.&#xD;

BLUE-EYED JESSIE.                  99&#xD;
&#xD;
[FROM GLEASON18 PICTORIAL DRAWING ROOM COMPANION.]&#xD;
BLUE-EYED JESSIE.&#xD;
BY MISS SARAN M. HOWE.&#xD;
&#xD;
(NOME, Jessie, my darling," spoke the&#xD;
mild voice of a pale, sad-looking lady,&#xD;
to her sweet little blue-eyed daughter, " I wish&#xD;
you to go to Mrs. Morton's, and see if she has&#xD;
any more work for me, and tell her this is fin-&#xD;
ished, but mother is too ill to carry it home her-&#xD;
self, and therefore sent you."&#xD;
" Yes, mother," replied the little girl, as she&#xD;
carelessly threw a light sun-bonnet over her&#xD;
brown curls, " but I mustn't stay,mother,must I"&#xD;
"No, my daughter, I shall be lonely without&#xD;
you, so be as quick as possible," answered Mrs.&#xD;
Williams, sighing as she thought of her absent&#xD;
husband, who had not entered his home for sev-&#xD;
eral days. In her beautiful, blue-eyed daughter,&#xD;
Jessie, she had endeavored to find consolation,&#xD;
but the tears would come to her eyes whenever&#xD;
she heard Jessie's oft-repeated question, " where&#xD;
has father gone ?" and though she answered,&#xD;
" he will be home presently, my dear," her heart&#xD;
toldher it would be long crc he returned.&#xD;
With a light heart and bounding step, Jessie&#xD;
Williams left her mother's door, and proceeded&#xD;
on her way to Mrs. Morton's stately dwelling.&#xD;
She heeded not the gay trifles so gaudily dis-&#xD;
played at the numerous shop windows, or the&#xD;
gorgeous dress and proud manner of the many&#xD;
people she passed, but kept steadily upon her&#xD;
way, free-hearted and happy, and caring not for&#xD;
&#xD;
the sneer of the crowd, which was often bestowed&#xD;
upon her, notwithstanding they often said, "she&#xD;
is very pretty indeed !"&#xD;
At last her long and circuitous route was trav-&#xD;
ersed, and she stood upon the steps of the&#xD;
splendid mansion of Mrs. Morton. Her heart&#xD;
beat quickly as she rang the bell, and she trem-&#xD;
bled visibly as she awaited the answer of the&#xD;
servant, to her question if Mrs. Morton was at&#xD;
home. The girl remembered that her mistress&#xD;
had said that " she was always at home to blue-&#xD;
eyed Jessie." and she kindly bade her enter the&#xD;
hall, and she would soon see the lady. A sweet&#xD;
smile rested upon the face of Mrs. Morton as&#xD;
the fair Jessie stood before her; for she was not&#xD;
like the majority of the wealthy class, selfish and&#xD;
cold-hearted, for, in earlier days, she had passed&#xD;
through affliction's trying ordeal, and came out&#xD;
bright and pure.&#xD;
" Ah, Jessie," said she, " you have come a long&#xD;
way for a little girl, and I think your mother&#xD;
would not have permitted it had she been well.&#xD;
She is not in her usual health, is she ?"&#xD;
"No, she is quite feeble, and therefore sent mm&#xD;
to return the articles she has lately finished, and&#xD;
get her more work, if possible. If you have any&#xD;
more to do. Mrs. Morton, mother would be&#xD;
pleased to do it."&#xD;
The lady hesitated, but in a moment replied:&#xD;
&#xD;
" No, I have none now; but come again to-&#xD;
morrow morning ; in the meantime, I will use&#xD;
my influence to procure some from Mrs. Lawson,&#xD;
for your mother, and I think I shall be success-&#xD;
ful. Come to-morrow, Jessie."&#xD;
"Yes, I will, and mother will be greatly&#xD;
obliged to you for your kindness," answered the&#xD;
little girl, as she turned to depart.&#xD;
While Jessie Williams had been conversing&#xD;
with Mrs. Morton, more than one person had&#xD;
been looking for her return. When she passed&#xD;
one of the many groups of people, that morning,&#xD;
her beauty and the happy expression of her&#xD;
countenance particularly interested a man com-&#xD;
posing one of the company of idlers,-and turning&#xD;
to a companion, he asked:&#xD;
" Who is that little beauty ?"&#xD;
"I b'lieve it's ';im Williams's daughter," was&#xD;
the reply.&#xD;
"What! is he in the city?"&#xD;
" Yes, when he's anywhere."&#xD;
" Will the girl return this way ?"&#xD;
" When she goes home," answered the fellow,&#xD;
turning away, as if the conversation was not&#xD;
pleasing, at least, to him.&#xD;
" I will speak to her, come what may," mur-&#xD;
mured the first mentioned gentleman, at the&#xD;
same time gazing far down the street, to ascer-&#xD;
tain if Jessie was still in view. Then seating&#xD;
himself where he could easily watch her coming,'&#xD;
his mind soon reverted back to the sad memo-&#xD;
ries of other years. Once a gentle sister stood&#xD;
by his side, and he had loved her with a brother's&#xD;
love-but she had gone, where, he knew not, or&#xD;
that she was living or dead. The father, to&#xD;
whom he had looked for advice and counsel,&#xD;
sank beneath the weight of years and sorrow,'&#xD;
into the grave, and the beloved mother soon fol-&#xD;
lowed to her final rest. Though amply provided&#xD;
with this world's wealth, still there was a long-&#xD;
ing in the bosom of the son for something more-&#xD;
for the companionship of some one whom lie&#xD;
could trust and love, and upon whom he could&#xD;
lavish the warm affections of his soul. Long did&#xD;
he muse upon the events of other days, and dwell&#xD;
upon their -memories, until his heart seemed&#xD;
buried 'neath the sad and gloomy ruins of the&#xD;
past. From these mournful reflections he was&#xD;
roused by the appearance of Jessie, and hastily&#xD;
rising, he made an effort to restore to his coun&#xD;
tenance its wonted cheerful expression, although&#xD;
his heart was far from happy. The next mo&#xD;
meant a hand was laid upon Jessie's shoulder&#xD;
and a kind voice said:&#xD;
&#xD;
" What is your name, my sweet little girl?"&#xD;
The large blue eyes of the child were raised&#xD;
inquiringly to the face of the stranger, and not&#xD;
until the question was repeated did she reply:&#xD;
"Jessie Williams ; but they call me blue-eyed&#xD;
Jessie."&#xD;
" Jessie Williams!" repeated the stranger,&#xD;
abstractedly; and again his mind went back&#xD;
through the dim path of years to that fair-haired&#xD;
sister, the pride of his earlier days.  Again&#xD;
memory began to bind him with her silken&#xD;
chains, but hastily recovering, he said to the&#xD;
wondering girl:&#xD;
"Is your home far from here, Jessie ?"&#xD;
" But a short distance, sir," replied the child;&#xD;
" it is on L- street."&#xD;
" Will you allow me to accompany you there ?"&#xD;
"Certainly, sir," answered Jessie; "folldw&#xD;
me"&#xD;
After following the girl through several streets,&#xD;
the stranger entered a small, half-ruined build-&#xD;
ing, whose only occupant was the pale mother&#xD;
of Jessie, Mrs. Williams. She seemed surprised&#xD;
at the appearance of a stranger, but with a sweet&#xD;
smile she bade him enter, for she hopedhe might&#xD;
bring intelligence of her husband, though she&#xD;
feared it would be far from pleasing. By de-&#xD;
grees he drew her into conversation, by asking&#xD;
questions respecting Jessie, her education and&#xD;
employment, until Mrs. Williams felt that though&#xD;
he was a stranger, he seemed like a sincere&#xD;
friend.&#xD;
" I have a favor to ask of you, Mrs. Williams,"&#xD;
said he, kindly, " and I hope you will not re-&#xD;
fuse."&#xD;
"1I shall not if it is reasonable, sir," answered&#xD;
she, " and if you will name it, I will soon tell&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" I have taken a strange interest in you and&#xD;
your daughter, Mrs. Williams, and I have a&#xD;
great desire to know your former history. If it&#xD;
be one of sorrow and suffering, then can I sym-&#xD;
pathize with you; for grief has often been my&#xD;
lot. Do not refuse my request, I beseech you."&#xD;
l   The lady hesitated for a moment, and then&#xD;
raising her head, she replied :&#xD;
"Yes, I will tell you my early history, but it&#xD;
is indeed a sad one. I should have said my&#xD;
later yeats have been the saddest of my life, for&#xD;
- my childhood was passed in sunshine and flow-&#xD;
ers. I will be brief, for it calls up sad recol-&#xD;
lections. Myself and my only brother were our&#xD;
parents' darlings, and high hopes were enter-&#xD;
tained of our future usefulness and worth, by&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="100" xml:id="VAC7458-00000049"/>&#xD;
100                  BLUE-EYED JESSIE.&#xD;
&#xD;
our fond friends. We grew from childhood to-&#xD;
gether, happy in each other's society, and not&#xD;
dreaming that'sorrow would ever be our por-&#xD;
tion, until the dark cloud settled upon our path,&#xD;
and separated us, I fear, forever. The son of a&#xD;
neighboring gentleman won my affections; but&#xD;
neither my parents nor brother would consent to&#xD;
our union, as they said James Williams was a&#xD;
profligate, reckless young man, and I should&#xD;
never be his bride. For months I Was sullen&#xD;
and unhappy ; but with earnest and oft-repeated&#xD;
entreaties, my lover at last persuaded me to&#xD;
leave the home of my father, and link my des-&#xD;
tiny with his forever.&#xD;
" Two years passed happily away. My hus-&#xD;
band was all'a wife could wish, and a happier&#xD;
home than ours it would be difficult to find.&#xD;
Since I left my father's home, I had heard nought&#xD;
of him, yet I regretted not the step I had taken,&#xD;
for I was happy, and that sufficed. With a view&#xD;
of bettering our worldly prospects, we removed&#xD;
to the city, but alas ! it was the destruction of&#xD;
our happiness. ~ My husband soon fell in com-&#xD;
pany with the vicious and vile cf the city, by&#xD;
whom he was persuaded to take occasionally a&#xD;
glass; but it soon was found to be true that he&#xD;
often drank without persuasion. His down-&#xD;
ward course was then rapid. Many times have&#xD;
I sat and awaited his coming until my head&#xD;
and heart ached with grief and fear, and often&#xD;
did I weep till my brow seemed bursting, but it&#xD;
would not bring back the happy days of our&#xD;
married life. Thus five years passed; my hus-&#xD;
band still becoming worse, until I lost alb hope&#xD;
&#xD;
of his reformation. The companionship of my&#xD;
only child,-Jessie, has been my only solace, and&#xD;
that she may never know my bitter misery, is&#xD;
her sad mother's earnest prayer. My father and&#xD;
mother have been laid to rest in the grave, and&#xD;
my brother is-I know not where. Should it&#xD;
please Heaven to take from me my gentle&#xD;
daughter, life would be a burden not to be borne ;&#xD;
but while she yet lives, I will live for her sake.&#xD;
I have thus given you my history, briefly,,it is&#xD;
true, but truthfully, and may it tell you how&#xD;
much a woman can suffer and yet be strong."&#xD;
For a few moments after she closed, a deep si-&#xD;
lence reigned. Each seemed wrapped in thought,&#xD;
when the stranger quickly rising, threw back the&#xD;
dark locks from his brow, and advancing to Mrs.&#xD;
Williams, said, in an impressive tone :&#xD;
"Elsie, do you recognize me now ?"&#xD;
She raised her head, and the only words&#xD;
spoken, were:&#xD;
"My brother!"&#xD;
" My sister I"&#xD;
Ten years have passed since the eventful day&#xD;
on which the brother and sister were again united,&#xD;
after long years of separation and suffering, and&#xD;
happiness is again their portion. The white&#xD;
cottage on the hill is the residence of James and&#xD;
Elsie Williams, and their beautiful, blue-eyed&#xD;
Jessie, now a blooming maiden of seventeen.&#xD;
The father is a temperate and happy man, but&#xD;
he persists in saying that he should have been&#xD;
in a drunkard's grave, had it not been for the,&#xD;
exertions of Elsie's brother and his own darling&#xD;
" Blue-eyed Jessie "&#xD;
&#xD;
THE END.&#xD;
