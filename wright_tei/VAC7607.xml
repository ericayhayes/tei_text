CHAPTER I.&#xD;
THE SILENT DEATE.&#xD;
The day had been sultry; but as it neared&#xD;
its close, soft and grateful zephyrs breathed&#xD;
balmily through the luxuriant Indian scenery.&#xD;
Earth and air seemed dreaming together.&#xD;
The murmurs of leaves were whispered&#xD;
thoughts, and the ripplings of running waters&#xD;
half revived memories of the past. The nod-&#xD;
ding flowers fainted and languished in their&#xD;
own perfumes ; the long grass drooped&#xD;
dreamily in the voluptuous atmosphere. The&#xD;
birds ceased to , sing, soothed :and content&#xD;
with the mere pleasure of mute existence.&#xD;
Even the deadly serpent lay harmless in its&#xD;
coil, robbed for a time of its malice by the&#xD;
all-conquering sweetness of the most delicious&#xD;
climate in the world.&#xD;
At this pleasing hour, when Nature herself&#xD;
sympathized with her creations, pulsing her&#xD;
own mysterious life into all animate things, a&#xD;
maiden, more beautiful than graceful palm&#xD;
or bending acacia, moved slowly from the&#xD;
trellised veranda of a . bamboo cottage to&#xD;
the sheltering canopy of a patriarchal ban-&#xD;
yan tree, beneath whose spreading arms she&#xD;
seated herself, on the folds of an Indian&#xD;
shawl.&#xD;
She was a young English girl, of eighteen&#xD;
years, with an exquisite form, and a face .to&#xD;
love at first sight. Her skin was whiter than&#xD;
the transparent muslin she wore, or the large&#xD;
pearls that encircled her neck and arms and&#xD;
hung in silvery lobps from her dark hair,&#xD;
after the fashion of the nativess. -Her teeth,&#xD;
seen through her crimson lips, were like&#xD;
drifted snow. Her eyes were large, her face&#xD;
oval and faultless in every feature.&#xD;
Her expression, as she reclined in the&#xD;
shade of the banyan, was serene and thought-&#xD;
ful. She had brought with her al book, but&#xD;
the falling twilight blurred the pages ; and&#xD;
&#xD;
she put it aside, and abandoned herself to&#xD;
the gentle influences of the hour.&#xD;
What the English beauty thought of, who&#xD;
may tell? Who shall guess the fancies that&#xD;
floated through her pretty head? Perhaps&#xD;
her consciousness was of earth ; possibly of a&#xD;
celestial region in the clouds.- Whatever&#xD;
were her reflections, it is certain that she&#xD;
presented a most pleasing picture to the eye,&#xD;
which well might be pardoned for returning&#xD;
again and again to the delightful contempla-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
Sometimes her eyes rested pensively upon&#xD;
the foliage at her feet ; sometimes they wan-&#xD;
dered dreamily upward through the thick&#xD;
branches of the trees-to fleecy little islands&#xD;
in the clouds; and sometimes the long, silk-&#xD;
en lashes closed languidly, shutting out'&#xD;
everything but the flowing shapes and images&#xD;
in her own brain.&#xD;
.On her right was the bamboo cottage, peep-&#xD;
ine from a mass of foliage, scented with the&#xD;
odor' of the Indian rose, and relieved. by the&#xD;
flowing leaves of the scarlet sagittaria; while&#xD;
at her left the tamarind, palm, and the ban&#xD;
yan, growing in serried columns, stretched&#xD;
downto the banks of the Jumna River-form-&#xD;
ing long and shady avenues, not only pictur-&#xD;
esque to the sight, but most grateful in the&#xD;
tropical heats.&#xD;
In one of these natural arcades, a nearly&#xD;
naked figure had been lying for the last hour.&#xD;
This half-nude body pertaied to and com-&#xD;
prised the personality of one of those' no-&#xD;
madic natives of India, whose lives, habits,&#xD;
religion, and manner of qubsistende, are alike&#xD;
a terror and a mystery.&#xD;
While he lay nestled in the long grass, he&#xD;
occasionally lifted himself upon his knees&#xD;
and looked toward -the bamboo cottage with&#xD;
an earnestness that evinced no ordinary pur-&#xD;
pose.&#xD;
- In critically observing his swarthy face,&#xD;

EILD OF THE CORD.                  18&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
HYDnABAD.&#xD;
Neal Kavanagh had no sooner fallen than&#xD;
Barnabas Hutton appeared at the spot, riding&#xD;
his elephant. Je was not a little astonished&#xD;
at seei  so may pale faces, nor was his sur-&#xD;
prise diminished when Methuselah, with an&#xD;
angry whistle, rushed to the scene of the en-&#xD;
counter, and seizing the tiger in his trunk,&#xD;
held him aloft in air.&#xD;
Perceiving soon that the tiger did not&#xD;
struggle, he tossed him into the jungle with&#xD;
an lnnignant cry, and turned his attention to&#xD;
Kavanagh, who was lying quite still.&#xD;
It was then that the noble animal displayed&#xD;
that intelligence which has rendered its spe-&#xD;
cies famous in every country where it is&#xD;
known.&#xD;
He lifted the Lieutenant carefully. The&#xD;
arm of woman couldnot have encircled him&#xD;
more gently. He set him upon his feet, and&#xD;
seeing that he could not immediately main-&#xD;
tain his footing, made a mournful noise.&#xD;
The friendly offices of the elephant were&#xD;
not in vain ; the motion started his blood and&#xD;
restored his consciousness. Grasping the&#xD;
trusty trunk of the animal, he soon managed&#xD;
to support himself; which encouraging&#xD;
symptom appeared to give Methuselah the&#xD;
liveliest pleasure.&#xD;
In the interim, Miss Macgregor had arisen;&#xD;
and now, impelfed by every instinct of her&#xD;
sex, advanced to'the assistance of Neal Kav-&#xD;
anagh. However benevolent her intentions.&#xD;
Methuselah could not so well judge of them&#xD;
as his master, and made a remonstrative&#xD;
movement as the young lady approached.&#xD;
'"None o' that, old boy !" exclaimed Barna-&#xD;
bas, who had thought proper to maintain a&#xD;
strict silence, during the foregoing act and&#xD;
ministrations of Methuselah. "'That isn't&#xD;
the kind of animile as young English officers&#xD;
are afraid of. They'd sooner, a durn sight,&#xD;
run arter 'em than from 'em. Let her come,&#xD;
old chap, and I'll wager your trunk chock&#xD;
full of sweetmeats that she'll bring him&#xD;
round quicker'n you can turn a summerset&#xD;
back'ards."&#xD;
Barnabas slid down from his mountain of&#xD;
flesh; and Methuselah, without further care-&#xD;
mony, set Kavanagh between his great flap-&#xD;
ping ears, and would have soon placed the&#xD;
young lady beside him,, had not his master&#xD;
interposed; his trunk being already around&#xD;
her waist.&#xD;
" That never'll do," said Barnabas. A boy&#xD;
seven years old would know better'n that.&#xD;
How'd you s'pose he's goin' to stick on up&#xD;
there ? Goin' to put the gal up to hold him&#xD;
on, wasn't ye? Meant well 'nough, I essay,&#xD;
but Englishwomen is pertick'lar 'bout being&#xD;
boosted to the backs of elephants."&#xD;

" Their discourse concerned Kavanagh, of&#xD;
whom Bracegirdle was intensely jealous. He&#xD;
bargained with Hydrabad to remove him&#xD;
from his path."&#xD;
"This seems incredible t" exclaimed Meli-&#xD;
cent.&#xD;
" The bargain was easily made. 'For one&#xD;
thousand rupees, he was to drop into the&#xD;
wound a poison so penetrating, that it would,&#xD;
in due time, produce death." -&#xD;
"I see-I partly comprehend, said Miss&#xD;
Rainbold..&#xD;
"I wished to thwart this crafty villain in&#xD;
my own way. Knowing of one very learned&#xD;
in the mystery of drugs and poisons, I lost&#xD;
notime in seeking him; a journey that nev-&#xD;
er could have been accomplished without the&#xD;
aid of Mr. Barnabas and his elephant... By&#xD;
the blessing of God I reached the hut of the&#xD;
solitaire and procured the antidote. The&#xD;
details of. the adventure I will relate to&#xD;
you at some future time ; for the undertak-&#xD;
ing was not unattended with danger.  I&#xD;
had-warned the young Sahib,'before setting&#xD;
out, not to have Hydrabad approach him, or&#xD;
touch his arm; but when Ireturned, the-mis-&#xD;
chief was done. . Hydrabad had stolen in&#xD;
while he slept, and dropped the deadly agent&#xD;
into the wound. His condition, this morning,&#xD;
you can yourse1(recall to mind. I had sup-&#xD;
posed nothing would transpire before morn-&#xD;
ing, and was shocked and alarmed at what&#xD;
I beheld, 'You know what followed. You&#xD;
saw the wily Hydrabad come in. You heard&#xD;
the words of Kavanagh concerning Mr. Bar-&#xD;
nabas, and what he said when he came in, he&#xD;
having been instructed by me. My mistress,&#xD;
behol this vial 1" She held up the serpen-&#xD;
tine vial. "It sparkles in the red rays of the&#xD;
sinking sun like the souls of a hundred dia-&#xD;
monds !"&#xD;
" Truly, girl, it is like concentrated white&#xD;
flame! And so you dropped a drop of this&#xD;
glittering fluid into the wound?".&#xD;
"I dropped it into the wound, my mistress,&#xD;
and the Sahib lives."&#xD;
"It is most wonderful! Why was this&#xD;
kept from me?".&#xD;
" why does anything happen that happens?&#xD;
Why did Hydrabad come? Why did your,&#xD;
lover come? Why are all things as they&#xD;
are? Because it is the will of God1" replied&#xD;
Alethe, with humility.&#xD;
" A strange reason, but perhapsagood one.&#xD;
My impatient and impulsive nature might&#xD;
not have been able to practice the necessary&#xD;
restraint."  Melicent paused, then .laid her&#xD;
right hand on the girl's breast.. " Alethe Y"&#xD;
she said-her accents were melancholy..&#xD;
"My mistress !" responded Alethes&#xD;
"Answer me this question. No you hear&#xD;
me, Alethe ?"&#xD;
" I hear you, mistress.",&#xD;
&#xD;
" Answer this question, and answer it tru-&#xD;
ly : Does Ida Macgregor-does Ida Mac-&#xD;
gregor-"&#xD;
Melicent's voice failed her&#xD;
Alethe kissed herJips, 'and answered:&#xD;
"Yes, sweet mistress, Ida loves himI!"&#xD;
Melicent threw her arms around the girl's&#xD;
neck, and sobbed  lke a child,- Alethe felt&#xD;
the hot tears raining on her,ec . -She drew&#xD;
the exquisite .iead nearer and neger,;kept&#xD;
her soft lips dn the white sorehead, and tp-&#xD;
ped the smooth cheeks ,contig uouslywith&#xD;
her little hand. There' was meffable balm&#xD;
i the silent ministrationis of the girl. ,Never,&#xD;
never had Melicent realized the, inestimable&#xD;
treasure of human sympathy. She clung to&#xD;
lethe as if every hope  everyr, happiness&#xD;
washin her.&#xD;
The girl knew the mockery of words, and&#xD;
did not interrupt this passionate outburst&#xD;
of emotion, She permitted ,her to weep&#xD;
on, unrestrained. The paroxysm gradually&#xD;
passed; the tears. ceased t6 flow, the sobs&#xD;
melted to sighs, and the sighs became leng-&#xD;
thened respirations.&#xD;
She was presently calm again. Embrac-&#xD;
ing Alethe tenderly, she lookedsat the setting&#xD;
sun,  d said, with composure :&#xD;
"Itis time to return. But before we go&#xD;
back, let me see you enter the hollow of this&#xD;
tree. Really, my friend, it seems impossible&#xD;
that this apparently solid trunk can contain&#xD;
a human being."&#xD;
"You shall, see I" cried Alethe, smilingly,&#xD;
and pushing away the grass, disappeared so&#xD;
suddenly that Melicent doubted the{evidence&#xD;
of her eyes.&#xD;
No sooner had the girl entered, than with&#xD;
a,terrified cry she sprang out.&#xD;
"HafIz! poor Hafi 1" she cried, wringing&#xD;
her hands. " This is the reward of his faith-&#xD;
fulness. This is his recompense for his de-&#xD;
votion to me !"&#xD;
"What is the matter ?" asked Melicent.&#xD;
"You are shocked and terrified."&#xD;
" The poor youth,"' cried Alethe, ".Will&#xD;
never watch more. He is dead ; he.lies cold&#xD;
on the ground. He has been discovered and&#xD;
slain. Stumbled over his body ; .I touched&#xD;
his face, it was the fage of'a corpse. Hafiz !&#xD;
poor Hafiz ".-&#xD;
" Grieve not, Alethe. The sin of his death&#xD;
is not your. Fortunately, here comes my&#xD;
father.. His. face glows with kindness I&#xD;

"Waiting for another tiger,. girls," cried&#xD;
the Major,, "or have you set your caps for a&#xD;

"Father, hasten! Some one has killed&#xD;
