CHAPTER I. -&#xD;
T   HE, sun was shedding its burn-&#xD;
ing rays on the beautiful lake,&#xD;
of Lucerne, burnishing the windows&#xD;
of the hotel which overlook it, and&#xD;
gilding the golden hair of a young&#xD;
girl who stood leaning against the&#xD;
casement of a. room on the first floor,&#xD;
just behind one of the transparent&#xD;
curtains that shaded her from the&#xD;
view of those without, but allowed&#xD;
her to see fully all that was passing&#xD;
in the garden beneath.    She was&#xD;
dressed in a soft white muslin, of&#xD;
which she seemed almost a part, so&#xD;
evanescent and fair was she to look&#xD;
at. She was not strictly beautiful,&#xD;
but as she stood' there, almost mo-&#xD;
tionless, her hair coiled around her&#xD;
delicate head in rich braids, which&#xD;
drooped into her white throat behind,&#xD;
her deep blue eyes fixed dreamily on&#xD;
the road that theyseemed to be fol-&#xD;
lowing with sad intensity, her frail&#xD;
figure so full of grace, her lips parted&#xD;
slightly, as if to let a sigh escape,&#xD;
which would no longer be. impris-&#xD;
oned by her heart, she was a picture&#xD;
worthy of Greuze's pencil. There&#xD;
was a lovely look of maidenhood about&#xD;
her, whichhe would gladly, stretch-&#xD;
ing out his hand to stop the swift&#xD;
race of time, have fixed forever on&#xD;
his canvas.&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
Gay laughter floated up to the&#xD;
window; young women, flirting with&#xD;
young men, were papsing on; she saw&#xD;
the little boats gliding to and fro, from&#xD;
the miniature dock at the foot,'of the&#xD;
hotel. Just at this moment a young&#xD;
couple came through the'porch; sev-&#xD;
eral gentlemen touched their hats to&#xD;
them. Ina bent forward, forgetting&#xD;
herself for the first. time, and, leaning&#xD;
slightly out of the window, listened&#xD;
breathlessly to catch their words.&#xD;
The gentleman spoke in German; the&#xD;
young lady answered him in the same&#xD;
language, yet she did not appear to&#xD;
be of that race, although her accent&#xD;
was so pure. She was earnest in her&#xD;
manner, with a smile on her lips, but&#xD;
an expression of melancholy in her&#xD;
eyes. Ina heard her say, "Mamma&#xD;
was married in the year -"; she did&#xD;
not catch the date. "Papa loved her&#xD;
so much." The gentleman yawned,&#xD;
and looked generally bored. " Papa&#xD;
died -"; again she did not hear the&#xD;
date, but she saw the lady look sad-&#xD;
der, and then a sweet little bird flew&#xD;
down at her feet, and stood in front&#xD;
of her, turning its pretty head, and&#xD;
making little skips on the sand, leav-&#xD;
ing a print as* of flowers behind it&#xD;
wherever it rested, seeming to say,&#xD;
as it glanced- up at the lady and co-&#xD;
quetted with the strong earth, "I care&#xD;
not who you are, God made me too,"&#xD;
&#xD;

2-             INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
and then, as if afraidof its own tin&#xD;
insolence, it spread its wings an&#xD;
flew away through the air. Ina say&#xD;
the lady look after it with a yearnin&#xD;
glance, and then she heard her say i&#xD;
perfect English, "0 pretty bird !&#xD;
She turned laughingly to the gentle&#xD;
man at her side, who looked as if th&#xD;
only interest the. little bird coul&#xD;
have for him would be to see i&#xD;
nicely cooked, and said, "Lieber Vo&#xD;
gel, fliege weiter, nimm ein kusz mit&#xD;
und ein -  *  They passed on. In&#xD;
smiled faintly, and added, "Grusz.&#xD;
She watched the lady as her viole&#xD;
muslin disappeared amongst the trees&#xD;
she thought it shed back"a perfum&#xD;
of its own color, and said td herself&#xD;
"I should not like it if he ever looked&#xD;
so indifferently on me "; she shud&#xD;
dered slightly and added, "I should&#xD;
,die!"  Two young ladies had also&#xD;
stopped to watch this couple who&#xD;
had excited such an interest iuIna&#xD;
One of the girls said to the other,&#xD;
"She is dressed like anybody else !&#xD;
" What makes you think it is she ?"&#xD;
said the other. " 0, I know it is,&#xD;
they said so; but when she lifted her&#xD;
gown, I knew she was the English&#xD;
Princess with her German bridegroom&#xD;
because her petticoat was a long train&#xD;
of white silk !"&#xD;
"Die- wahre Primzessin," t thought&#xD;
Ina to herself. "It is Hans Andersen's&#xD;
own story of the green pea under her&#xD;
mattress again !  So that was the&#xD;
Princess. I thought in her young&#xD;
rounded face there was something&#xD;
that was different from all the rest!&#xD;
She too is on her wedding tour. Do&#xD;
* "Dear bird, fly onward ; take a kiss with&#xD;
thee, and a - greeting."&#xD;
t " The true Princess i "&#xD;
&#xD;
INA.                    3&#xD;
&#xD;
.y all men look so after marriage? le&#xD;
.d did not seem glad at all." A slight&#xD;
w shudder passed again over her deli-&#xD;
g cate frame, a cloud rested a nomenlt&#xD;
n on her brow, just as when a bird flies&#xD;
between you and the sun, and she&#xD;
- repeated: "I should die ; life seems&#xD;
e to me now as if I were to hear always&#xD;
d the soft waters of a rivulet running&#xD;
t over my heart as that does over the&#xD;
- snow-white pe bles that lie in it; as&#xD;
b, if I were ever to be flooded by the&#xD;
a warm rays of the sun, with the fra-&#xD;
grance of wild Eastern flowers filling&#xD;
t my senses, and the music of love&#xD;
sounding through everything, his eyes&#xD;
e ever bent on mine, so that I feel they&#xD;
are resting there, but cannot raise&#xD;
I mine to meet them."&#xD;
- , The color faintly rose in her cheeks&#xD;
I as she said these words to herself,&#xD;
and then deepened, until it covered&#xD;
her whole face and brow ; it faded&#xD;
. away as it came, and she leaned for-&#xD;
ward again, impatiently gazing into&#xD;
the long distance of road before her.&#xD;
A loud knock was just.then heard at&#xD;
her door ; she started, hastily crossed&#xD;
the room, sat down in an arm-chair&#xD;
that was near the table, and, taking a&#xD;
book in. her hand, called out as&#xD;
quietly as she could " Entrez !" A.&#xD;
servant put in his head, and said,&#xD;
" C'est l'heure du diner. Est-ce que&#xD;
Madame va descendre ? "&#xD;
"Non,"   she   answered, hesitat-&#xD;
ingly.-'&#xD;
The servant looked at her with a&#xD;
sort of stupid curiosity.  "Est-ce que&#xD;
Mademoiselle vent diner dans sa&#xD;
chambre("&#xD;
"Non ie answered, rather haugh-&#xD;
tily. .The servant shut the door,&#xD;
mumbling something to himself:, and&#xD;
&#xD;
was alone again. She began to t]&#xD;
swalk the room nervously, her cheeks a&#xD;
burned, and her hands were cold as n&#xD;
icred, "What shall I do ?" she said.&#xD;
"I am so alone, I begin to feel fright- h&#xD;
c am d;and she began to cry, but n&#xD;
she wiped away the tears,'and sat t&#xD;
down, and tried to read. It was an a&#xD;
English book, and the first thing her s&#xD;
eyes fell on was this line, " Thus, as h&#xD;
in Burger's poem those words, 'Bei n&#xD;
ni, bei ihin ist Seligkeit, und ohne ii&#xD;
Wilhelm Hllle'-"*she did not read&#xD;
any farther. "Ah, that is true!" she I&#xD;
murmured ; "when will he come ?" h&#xD;
and she resumed her weary walk up r&#xD;
and down the parlor, stopping every&#xD;
time to look longingly out of there&#xD;
window.&#xD;
The garden was quite desolate&#xD;
now, and the sun was beginning to t&#xD;
go down. It had been trying to look&#xD;
into the lake, made dusky by those&#xD;
dark mountains, like a beautiful eye&#xD;
by its long fringe of lashes, and, baf-&#xD;
fled and angry, it was disappearing&#xD;
now, blood-red, as if chafed with dis-&#xD;
appointment, behind those very barri-&#xD;
ers to its happiness. The lake looked&#xD;
dull, as if it too did not like being&#xD;
left by its hot, inpo : unate lover, and&#xD;
Ina saw the Princess coming slowly&#xD;
back from her walk. She too had&#xD;
Saxon hair and blue eyes ; she looked&#xD;
pale. Her liege lord was flushed with&#xD;
his walk. They came nearer. The&#xD;
Prince looked up, and so did the&#xD;
Princess ; she smiled, and he said&#xD;
with a yawn, " Schdnes Mdchen,&#xD;
sie kdnnte deine Sechwester sein." t&#xD;
Ina drew back, blushing, behind&#xD;
* "Near him, near him is blessedness, and&#xD;
t Bautifu 1maiden, she mighitbe thy sister.".&#xD;
&#xD;
he curtain, but she heard the lady&#xD;
nswer, in English, "She looks Ger-&#xD;
nan, and might understand you."&#xD;
"What difference does that make ?"&#xD;
le answered in German. " Every wo-&#xD;
man likes to hear herself called beau-&#xD;
iful"; and so their voices died away,&#xD;
nd Ina was alone again. " Better,"&#xD;
he said, in her fever of anxiety, "-to&#xD;
lave him even cold and indifferent&#xD;
ear her than to be all alone ; she&#xD;
s far happier than I !"&#xD;
The sun sank slowly away, and&#xD;
na, weary of looking out, weary of&#xD;
herself and of life, sit d6wn to see if&#xD;
not watching would not bring him.&#xD;
Twilight stole into the room, the&#xD;
moon rose, and now her feelings grew&#xD;
almost unbearable ; she rang the bell;&#xD;
a'man-servant answered it. "Send&#xD;
th'e maid," she said. The man was&#xD;
gone about five minutes, there was a&#xD;
great ringing of bells, and then the&#xD;
.maid appeared.&#xD;
"DQes Madame wish me?"&#xD;
"Yes; has the last train arrived?"&#xD;
"No, there is one arrives at nine.&#xD;
Madame has been all day without&#xD;
eating. Is Madame expecting a&#xD;
friend?"&#xD;
"Yes ; are you married ?"&#xD;
lhe girl drew herself lap, as if the&#xD;
mere suggestion were deleterious to&#xD;
the purity of her life, and answered-&#xD;
shortly, " Not I, Madame; is Madame&#xD;
or Mademoiselle married ?"&#xD;
"No," answered Ina, in her turn&#xD;
shortly, and coloring in spite of her-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
" Then Mademoiselle is expecting&#xD;
her father ?"&#xD;
" Are you happy here ?" said Ina,&#xD;
vexed that the woman asked her so&#xD;
many questions, yet hoping that she&#xD;

again,   anything was: better than lief. " Ach, er ist's !" Ina draws tim..&#xD;
that.                               idly away from the window, lest he&#xD;
The woman smiled, and said she should hear her noiseless foot-tread;&#xD;
worked hard. Ina remembered how she is pale now as the moon that is&#xD;
much happier she had been when she just overhead, and looks as soft and&#xD;
worked too, aid .said, looking up at misty as it does, sailing in those&#xD;
her, "Yes, that makes happiness."   fleecy clouds above.&#xD;
"Your hands don't look as if you A hasty tread on the stairs, a&#xD;
knew much about it."                knock at the door, and he stands be-&#xD;
Ina looked at her hands, which lay fore her ; the servant shuts the door,&#xD;
whiter on her fresh white dress even she looks at him timidly, and then&#xD;
than that, and smiled. She answered, exclaims with rapture, "Ach Gott!&#xD;
"I never did that kind of work."    you  have come   at last. I waited&#xD;
A bell, and the maid says, " That is alone so long !" This is said in Ital-&#xD;
for me; can I do anything for Madem- ian. He holds her in his arms, her&#xD;
oiselle ?"                          face is averted, and hidden on his&#xD;
Ina longs to say "Come again!" shoulder.&#xD;
but she dares not. She thinks, if he. He strains her to him, as if she&#xD;
should come and find her talking with were a rose, which he is crushing&#xD;
a maid-servant, he would be angry; that its fragrance may all be his.&#xD;
so she lets her go with a hopeless look She lies powerless in his iron embrace;&#xD;
in her blue eyes, and sits quite still her breath comes fast, like a child's,&#xD;
again. At last she hears a rumbling that has been in grief, but is check-&#xD;
of wheels, she jumps up and walks ing its sobs with long sighs of return-&#xD;
listlessly to the window ; how many ing peace. He draws her to the sofa,&#xD;
times to-day her feet have made the nearer, nearer to him, as if he would&#xD;
same journey! Her heart beats so never let her go again.&#xD;
fast that she can hear-it almost is it  "Anima mia,"t he says, as he bends&#xD;
chafes against her bodice. , She leans over her, and presses ifs lips to her&#xD;
quite out of 'the window, and sees the throat, just there under her golden&#xD;
stages come up to the door; suddenly braids, "look at me, look up into&#xD;

&#xD;
ready assembled for an especial ap-&#xD;
pointment we had, that I was -sudden-&#xD;
ly taken ill, and I was off, an hour&#xD;
after, in the train which leaves Turin&#xD;
for Milan."&#xD;
"Will they not be angry ?" she&#xD;
said timidly. "Was it right ? "&#xD;
"As for their anger, they may cool&#xD;
it by the first northern wind that&#xD;
blows,- I wish it would come from&#xD;
America, and dissipate all their mis-&#xD;
erable mists; and as for right, right&#xD;
is wrong, and wrong is right, accord-&#xD;
ingly as you let the light strike on it,&#xD;
-your hair is ahnos't dark now, and&#xD;
a few moments ago it was like the&#xD;
sun's own beams."&#xD;
"Yes; but then its color is not&#xD;
really changed, and so right is always&#xD;
right, and wrong is wrong."&#xD;
"The only rights that I acknowl-&#xD;
edge are those of love," he said, kiss-&#xD;
ing her hair, for her face was still&#xD;
hidden; " the only wrong, to turn&#xD;
your back on a beautiful woman."&#xD;
" Hush !" - putting her little hand&#xD;
over his mouth, and turning her face&#xD;
for the first time up to his,-" I am&#xD;
jealous, jealous as Rosmunda. I too&#xD;
would kill my rival," she said, with a&#xD;
sudden lightning in his blue sky.&#xD;
"If you knew," he said, fixing his&#xD;
dark eyes on her with admiration,&#xD;
"how much I love you when you&#xD;
speak and look thus."&#xD;
"Do you not love me always the&#xD;
same?" she said, with a faltering&#xD;
tone of wonder in her voice.&#xD;
"Always the same," he answered;&#xD;
"but all the more when your Ger-&#xD;
man snow is lit up by our Italian sun ;&#xD;
then it dazzles like the Jungfrau,&#xD;
it is all it needs, a constant sunset."&#xD;
"Do not say so," she said, clinging&#xD;
&#xD;
to him. "You mean that I should al-&#xD;
ways need its parting rays, which are&#xD;
those of sorrow, to make me glow&#xD;
with color enough for your Southern&#xD;
eyes ; that for you I shall give out&#xD;
sweetest music only when you are&#xD;
leaving me, like Egypt's statue. God&#xD;
forbid !"&#xD;
A knock at the door made her&#xD;
bound from the place where she was&#xD;
like a deer that hears the bugle-horn,&#xD;
and she stood near the table,. with&#xD;
her head thrown back, in very much&#xD;
the same attitude as this graceful&#xD;
animal when it is listening with a&#xD;
mixture of pride and defiance to the&#xD;
approaching step of its pursuer.&#xD;
Her lover looked at her, as she&#xD;
stood there, as if he were drinking in&#xD;
her beautiful form with every sense,&#xD;
and then, turning quietly to the door,&#xD;
said in a commanding voice, "Entrez!"&#xD;
A servant opened the door to ask&#xD;
where he should put Monsieur's trunk.&#xD;
"Bring it in here," he answered.&#xD;
She spoke quickly in Italian in a&#xD;
low voice, coloring up to her tem-&#xD;
ples: "No, not here ; these are my&#xD;
rooms."&#xD;
He turned sternly to- the waiter,&#xD;
and saying "Find a room for me&#xD;
where you can" came back to where&#xD;
she stood; he said in quick, almost&#xD;
mocking tones, t "Are you not my   4&#xD;
wife ?"&#xD;
"Not yet," she answered distinctly,&#xD;
very pale now, but throwing back her&#xD;
head, and looking him proudly in'the&#xD;
face. Then coming up to him, and&#xD;
putting her arms around his neck,&#xD;
she said coaxingly, " Are you not&#xD;
tired ? Will you not eat something?"&#xD;
"hnhave you eaten ?" he said,&#xD;
turning quickly to look at her.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Not all day," she answered, laugh&#xD;
ing. " How could I eat when I was ii&#xD;
such a fever of anxiety? it would&#xD;
have choked me."&#xD;
" Foolish child," he said, lookingat&#xD;
her with tender anxiety, "you will&#xD;
eat now." He rang the bell and or-&#xD;
dered supper in their parlor,-cold&#xD;
chicken, anything they had. The&#xD;
table was soon prepared, and Ina&#xD;
took her place at the head, and be-&#xD;
gan helping him to the cold meat.&#xD;
"I have dined," he said.&#xD;
" Yes ; but'you will -not refuse to&#xD;
eat with mhe,jus for company's sake,"&#xD;
she said, holdi g out a wing of the&#xD;
chicken on he , own fork, and look-&#xD;
ing winninglyfp at him. Emanuele&#xD;
.Bertani was a tall man, with dark&#xD;
eyes,- which  1en not interested in&#xD;
what was before him, were indiffer-&#xD;
ent, ordinary black eyes, when roused&#xD;
to life by the subject or object that&#xD;
for the moment absorbed him, were&#xD;
full of flakes of light, -- they glowed,&#xD;
they 'fired like a grand war-horse.&#xD;
His brow was handsome, his features&#xD;
good, his hair fell in large dark waves&#xD;
over his really grand forehead, and it&#xD;
seemed as if the same peculiar light&#xD;
glanced in his teeth,his hair, and his&#xD;
eyes. He was somewhat massive in&#xD;
form, and as he sat there beside that&#xD;
delicate fair woman, he." looked so&#xD;
powerful, she so fragile, that you&#xD;
could not but trust that he would-&#xD;
use the greater strength that nature&#xD;
had given him gently, for her sake.&#xD;
"I feed on your beauty," he said. .&#xD;
"You do not look," she answered&#xD;
archly, " as if that were your only&#xD;
diet. Do you not feel, as Byron did,&#xD;
that a we man loses all her charms if&#xD;
she has an appetite ? If I did not&#xD;
&#xD;
-'think it would be so, I would eat, for&#xD;
n I am very faint for want of food ; but&#xD;
1 you must do something, you must&#xD;
light a cigar."&#xD;
t   "Do you not mind the smoke ?"&#xD;
l "Not if they are not Cavours. I&#xD;
- own that, although half Italian."&#xD;
"You!" he said, with an amused&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"Yes, I, all but the coloring."&#xD;
" Of your nature ?"&#xD;
"No, -you are very impertinent,&#xD;
- of my hair and eyes. You do not&#xD;
let me say half I want to. I suppose&#xD;
you think that a little thing like me&#xD;
must tremble before you as a states-&#xD;
man, but am I not to be at least Bru-&#xD;
tus's wife, if not Cato's daughter ?&#xD;
Then half your mantle will fall over&#xD;
me, and it will be enough to cover&#xD;
me all."&#xD;
The smoke of his cigar is curling&#xD;
up over his head and making a/veil&#xD;
of mist between them, his head is&#xD;
leaning back against the chair, his&#xD;
eyes half closed, and he is looking&#xD;
under them fixedly at her._&#xD;
"When is it to be ? - very early&#xD;
to-morrow morning    hes&#xD;
The blood has rushed to her neck&#xD;
and  brow, even   her hands are&#xD;
blushing ; it seems as if her color&#xD;
tinged with a. roseate hue the smoke&#xD;
that lay between them.&#xD;
"When you will," she answers, her&#xD;
eyelids suddenly drooping heavily&#xD;
over her eyes, as if she could not&#xD;
raise them again.&#xD;
"I will to-morrow morning," he&#xD;
says- with determination, "before the&#xD;
earth has reddened under the sun's&#xD;
glance half as deeply as you did just&#xD;
now."&#xD;
" You are my master," she an-&#xD;
&#xD;
swered; "to hear is to obey ! Is not&#xD;
tlt the tiway in Italy ? "- her eyes&#xD;
.still shaded by her long lashes.&#xD;
"Look up at me ; there is so much&#xD;
trust in your eyes."&#xD;
* " Not now, I cannot."&#xD;
. "Will you to-morrow ?"&#xD;
"Yes," she says, blushing, " if you&#xD;
do not look at me too earnestly. I&#xD;
am half afraid of you, yet I might&#xD;
say with Ii)esdeiona, 'why I should&#xD;
fear I know not --'"  She hesitated.&#xD;
"I must not finish the line."&#xD;
"Why not ?"&#xD;
"I fear I canpt say 'since guilti-&#xD;
ness I know not, for I have deeply&#xD;
deceived the best of friends," she&#xD;
adds, with a deep sigh.           -&#xD;
"To-morrow ; why do you look at&#xD;
your watch ?"&#xD;
"Because," she said, with a fright-&#xD;
ened look, "it is very late, the hotel&#xD;
is all still, you must go."&#xD;
"Not yet!" ie said, with a look of&#xD;
passionate entreaty.&#xD;
"Yes,"she answered; "good night."&#xD;
He has caught her in his arms,&#xD;
and before she has time to loosen his&#xD;
hold, has pressed his lips to her eyes&#xD;
and lips. " Good night, mia bella,&#xD;
anima mia!" *&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
T HE next morning Ina was waked&#xD;
at an early hour by the well-&#xD;
lown rap of her impatient lover;&#xD;
she had just fallen asleep, after a&#xD;
restless few hours of tossing to and&#xD;
fro since Ire left her. She called out&#xD;
laughingly : "I cannot come'yet, you&#xD;
must wait."&#xD;
* My beautiful one, my soul!t&#xD;
&#xD;
"Open the door a little way," he&#xD;
answers in a low voice.&#xD;
She has sprung from    the bed,&#xD;
thrown on her white-flannel dressing-&#xD;
gown, and, hiding herself well behind&#xD;
the door, opens it a tiny crack.&#xD;
"I will go out to arrange matters,&#xD;
and will be back in half an hour."&#xD;
"Stay an hour !"   she answers,&#xD;
blushing bellind the door.&#xD;
"Very well, I give you an hour.&#xD;
Addio."&#xD;
" Addio," and she shuts the door&#xD;
and locks it again. Ina begins with&#xD;
tremulous hand to bi'ush out. her&#xD;
long locks, and coil them around her&#xD;
small head ; then she begins her toi-&#xD;
let, and washes and dresses with a&#xD;
sort of nervous haste, thinking all the&#xD;
time: "I am alone, nobody dreams&#xD;
that I am here ; yet I am happy, 0,&#xD;
so happy r I feel just like a bird, as&#xD;
if I could fill the whole world with&#xD;
my song, as if I had wings and must&#xD;
soar above the earth. It makes me&#xD;
sad to think that everybody is not so&#xD;
happy as I. I wish the Prince had&#xD;
not such vapid eyes, they look as if&#xD;
they could only reflect roast-beef;&#xD;
and the poor Princess - hers seemed&#xD;
just fitted to mirror forth the stars,&#xD;
jasmines, blue violets, and pansies.&#xD;
I wonder why we must die, why we&#xD;
cannot always live with love in our&#xD;
hearts, and this' exquisite atmbs-&#xD;
phere of happiness~breathing around&#xD;
us like Persian roses. Ai.t" she&#xD;
said, with a short sigh of rapture,&#xD;
"perhaps it would be too much !"&#xD;
Sh opened tie window and breathed&#xD;
in tile sweetness of tile morning air ;&#xD;
sihe looked down the road once&#xD;
more, and then at her watchl; the&#xD;
hour was just passed, and she&#xD;
&#xD;
INA.                                    7&#xD;

8                          INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
began to feel a little nervous sen-&#xD;
sation steal over her again, when she&#xD;
looked down, and saw her lover&#xD;
standing just under the window where&#xD;
she was. He was gazing up at her&#xD;
with earnestness, and love in his&#xD;
eyes. . She let drop a flower that she&#xD;
held in her hand; he caught it, and&#xD;
said, "Will you come down? he is&#xD;
waiting for us."&#xD;
"Who?" she said, trembling a lit-&#xD;
tle, and turning pale. "I will come.&#xD;
Wait there for me.",&#xD;
With hurried hands she put on her&#xD;
little round hat, and hastened down&#xD;
stairs.        .&#xD;
" How divinely you look !" he said,&#xD;
as he drew her arm tenderly under&#xD;
his. " Your dress is like one of your&#xD;
own Heine's poems, full of suggestions&#xD;
which are born on the earth and die&#xD;
in the clouds."&#xD;
"Do you like it ? " she said, look-&#xD;
ing up at him. " I never am satisfied&#xD;
with anything I wear until I know&#xD;
that it has pleased you !"&#xD;
Her dress was a transparent white&#xD;
muslin, covered With wreaths of large&#xD;
dark violets, so true to nature that&#xD;
they seemed as if they were pressed&#xD;
upon it; a long white feather in her&#xD;
round hat, fastened with a bunch of&#xD;
the same flowers, completed her&#xD;
toilet.&#xD;
"Women are blamed," he said,&#xD;
"for thinking too much of dress, but&#xD;
men forget that they are but artists,&#xD;
painting pictures continually for us ;&#xD;
it is a living gallery, better than any&#xD;
that the Pitti Palace can furnish for&#xD;
us."&#xD;
*" Ah yes!I" she answered; " but&#xD;
~Sir Joshua Reynolds tells us that&#xD;
if all the time, taste, and thought that&#xD;
&#xD;
we expend on our toilet were devoted&#xD;
to some artistic object, we might be-&#xD;
come remarkable as painters or sculp-&#xD;
tors, - would not that be better ?"&#xD;
"To me," he answered, "the idea&#xD;
is merely insupportable of women's&#xD;
becoming anything save the lovely.&#xD;
idols they are now of men,"&#xD;
" Ah," she said, crimsoning, "do&#xD;
not say so! I think it is terrible&#xD;
for women to be - to be as the Ital-&#xD;
ian women are generally, with no&#xD;
minds save for th6 petty life of every&#xD;
day, with no souls save for the pass-&#xD;
ing pleasures of the moment."&#xD;
"You pass unscathed," he said,&#xD;
"by my resentment for my country-&#xD;
women, as a flower does before the&#xD;
thunder, merely because you look so&#xD;
lovely when you reason."&#xD;
" I would rather it were," she an-&#xD;
swered, laughing, "because my rea-&#xD;
son convinces you."&#xD;
" If there is to' me a thing in life&#xD;
that is detestable, 'it is the new&#xD;
American doctrine, which will solve&#xD;
the great problem of the end of the&#xD;
world sooner than any other theory.&#xD;
Would you like best, my love, to&#xD;
become a preacher from the pulpit,&#xD;
or a surgeon ? " he said, looking&#xD;
down fondly at her little hands.&#xD;
"I should like to become," she&#xD;
said earnestly, "a true, woman, a&#xD;
fit companion for you, so that I&#xD;
should understand all that you did,&#xD;
and could help you, and live thus&#xD;
doubly for and with you !"&#xD;
"Do not forget," he said thought-&#xD;
fully, "that Sappho lost her lover;&#xD;
if woman lost her dolce abatndono,*&#xD;
she would lose all her charms for&#xD;
men."&#xD;
* sweet abandonment. .&#xD;
&#xD;
Ina dared not press the subject&#xD;
any further, for she knew well that&#xD;
she could play like a child with her&#xD;
lover's gentler moods, but that she&#xD;
must not anger him.&#xD;
They had been walking in a shady&#xD;
path, which now   suddenly opened&#xD;
into- the broad road,,and there, right&#xD;
before them, stood the lovely church&#xD;
of Lucerne, where the organ peals&#xD;
out with such power, and then sud-&#xD;
denly, as if a choir of angels were&#xD;
answering it in the distance, you&#xD;
hear the veiled voices of young ne-&#xD;
ophytes, that seem to be following&#xD;
the music and playing with it, and&#xD;
filling it with a flood of harmony&#xD;
now it rumbles along the walls, and&#xD;
presses against them, as if it would&#xD;
burst away from the narrow place&#xD;
where it is imprisoned and flood the&#xD;
whole air and earth with melody ;&#xD;
now it seems as if it were all with-&#xD;
out, coming down from the sky and&#xD;
seeking admittance just there within&#xD;
that hallowed precinct. All was&#xD;
still now. Ina trembled, and drew&#xD;
nearer to her protector. The door&#xD;
stood half open, and a sleepy-looking&#xD;
sexton was on the steps, apparently&#xD;
watching for the approaching couple.I&#xD;
Emnanuele pressed her arm closer'&#xD;
and closer to his heart, as if he&#xD;
would give her fresh courage, and I&#xD;
they passed into the vestibule, up&#xD;
the aisle, towards the altar, where&#xD;
a Protestant clergyman was await-&#xD;
ing themr. Ina dropped down on&#xD;
her knees when she reached the last&#xD;
step, and the service. had already i&#xD;
begun. When the minister came to&#xD;
the place " With this ring I thee&#xD;
wed," he paused a moment, and put I&#xD;
out his hand for the ring. Signor I&#xD;
&#xD;
Bertani looked embarrassed ; he had&#xD;
none with him. Ina quickly slipped&#xD;
off one of her own, and, giving it to&#xD;
the clergyman, it was replaced by&#xD;
her bridegroom on the fourth finger&#xD;
of her left hand ; she could not help&#xD;
smiling through her tears when she&#xD;
saw it there, her own ring. The&#xD;
ceremony was soon over ; there had&#xD;
been no one to give away the bride,&#xD;
there were no friends to turn to, no&#xD;
mother in whose arms to be received&#xD;
The clergyman was a venerable-&#xD;
looking old man. He seemed to feel&#xD;
Ina's loneliness, as she turned away&#xD;
with a choking sound in her throat,&#xD;
and he said solemnly, " God bless&#xD;
you, my daughter."&#xD;
"Thank you," she said, "father,"&#xD;
and stretched out her hand to him.&#xD;
He held it in his a moment, looking&#xD;
into her young fresh face as if he&#xD;
would gladly read her future there ;&#xD;
as well might he look into the, petals&#xD;
of a fair flower to find the reflection&#xD;
of the storm that is to scatter its&#xD;
leaves to the wind.&#xD;
Emanuele Bertani drew her other&#xD;
hand hastily again under his arm,&#xD;
and, handing to the old father a&#xD;
heavy envelope, he hurried down the&#xD;
lonely aisle with his Ina. " You are&#xD;
my wife now," he whispered in low,&#xD;
impassioned accents, "my own, my&#xD;
beautiful Ina. No one can rob me of&#xD;
you now ; your sweets are all mine,&#xD;
not even Marcello can approach you&#xD;
now."&#xD;
Ina blushed and, looked fully up&#xD;
nto his eyes;'yesterday she could&#xD;
not look him so in the face ; it was a&#xD;
wife's trusting gaze, as if she said, " I&#xD;
fear not you, nor the whole world&#xD;
beside, now." The tears were still&#xD;

"You are the butterfly," she said, stirred her inmost soul, "Is not this&#xD;
smiling, "that has stolen my dew." love ? How I should wish to live&#xD;
" And you are the rose, who have forever alone for you !,"&#xD;
brushed off my down, so that I can-   " You must live for your country,"&#xD;
not fly away any more."             she whispered.&#xD;
"Would you if you could?" she       His face darkened, and he spoke&#xD;
said archly.                        quickly: "Live for ingratitude,--for&#xD;

swered, laughing.                   of escape, - for a land that is dead,&#xD;
They reached the hotel by trle when the- only recompense of talent&#xD;
same shady path. They breakfasted is envy and hatred, - for a mistress&#xD;
in their little parlorand then went who is fairer and foiler than a Mes-&#xD;
out to find the cottage that Bertani salina, whose chanf s ,clank even&#xD;
had settled upon when he had been under her soft tread, whose tears of&#xD;
&#xD;
at Lucerne before. It was very small,&#xD;
all, covered with vines, like a little&#xD;
nest in the green trees. In the door&#xD;
stood a cheerful-looking young wo-&#xD;
man with blue eyes and golden hair&#xD;
too. Ina wished, as she looked at&#xD;
her, that her own were dark ; light&#xD;
hair seems so common, she thought,&#xD;
in this country. Bertani had known&#xD;
this woman in Florence, and he had&#xD;
sent her here to make ready all&#xD;
things for them.&#xD;
"You are very.welcome, Madame,"&#xD;
she said to Ina in broken Italian.&#xD;
" Thank you," said Ina. " It is a&#xD;
sweet little home," she said, turning&#xD;
to her husband, "and I like the looks&#xD;
of my little maid."&#xD;
" You will like her, I am sure ; she&#xD;
is one of the most remarkable crea-&#xD;
tures I ever knew. I knew her first&#xD;
husband well."   '&#xD;
"Has she had two husbands' so&#xD;
y.said Ina. "That is one too&#xD;
many."              ...&#xD;
They sat down on the porch to-&#xD;
gether.&#xD;
&#xD;
repentance are false as French dia-&#xD;
monds, whose courage is to hide&#xD;
herself behind the cuirass of her&#xD;
conquerors, whose strength is that of&#xD;
a  Delilah, treachery   to  her own&#xD;
heroes ; she lures them to her beau-&#xD;
tiful arms, and then, when they sleep&#xD;
in security and trust, she cuts away&#xD;
their hopes and their power ; she.&#xD;
holds the glittering knife red with&#xD;
her own blood in her hands, and&#xD;
laughs at its ruby drops ; she goes to&#xD;
the  market-place   of nations, and,&#xD;
stripping herself, shows those scars&#xD;
which she ought to blush to wear !&#xD;
Live for her ! No! save that through&#xD;
her I may live for myself!" As he&#xD;
spoke thus, his breath came quick,&#xD;
his white teeth were clenched, but&#xD;
his eyes had none of the light in them&#xD;
that Ina's so - often shrank before ;&#xD;
they were cold and lustreless. He&#xD;
spoke with warmth, but there was&#xD;
no fire in his face. Ina looked at&#xD;
him with a strand feeling of awe,&#xD;
almost pity.&#xD;
"Then die for it !" she said with&#xD;
&#xD;
10&#xD;
&#xD;
sudden energy, leaving 1his side, and&#xD;
standing with flushing cheeks look-&#xD;
lug at him.&#xD;
"You seem inspired, as if you were&#xD;
a second Joan d'Arc," he said. "I&#xD;
would willingly be the English gen-&#xD;
eral, and leave my country foi your&#xD;
love at any moment."&#xD;
"If you would do that, you would&#xD;
leave me as easily for another love.&#xD;
I would rather be Clorinda, and, dy-&#xD;
iug, be baptized with your faith;&#xD;
that would be sweet :" she said, with&#xD;
a bright smile lighing her whole&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"I 'would rather you were Armida,&#xD;
not coming for the battle-field nor&#xD;
heeding the dust of life, only leading&#xD;
nie on and on, by the light of your&#xD;
beautiful eyes, into the green mead-&#xD;
ows of pleasure, through the spark-&#xD;
ling waves of passionunto the banks&#xD;
of love and -lesire. Come, put off&#xD;
your helmet and your shield, and tell&#xD;
ie all I most want to know, -how&#xD;
you left Turin, what the Benonis&#xD;
thought of your sudden decision. I&#xD;
did not see them after you left. I&#xD;
avoided going there purposely."&#xD;
Ina took a seat a little way from&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"No, not there," he said; -' you look&#xD;
like a soft cloud= that is just sailing&#xD;
away. I must ever touch you to&#xD;
know that you are palpable."&#xD;
"I will come," shaid, laughing,&#xD;
"and settle on Ary mountain's top, and&#xD;
throw it all iii the shadow if I can."&#xD;
She came and stood near him, leaning&#xD;
her arms on his shoulder, and run-&#xD;
ning her fingers through his dark&#xD;
-hair.                          .&#xD;
" How black your hair is.!" she&#xD;
said. "It looks as if time never would&#xD;
&#xD;
steal into it,. and pay its silver price&#xD;
for all these beautiful locks."&#xD;
"It would be more unwarrantable&#xD;
if he robbed you of your gold," he&#xD;
said. " I am glad we did not live when&#xD;
the old masters did, for Raphael&#xD;
might have died of love for you, in-&#xD;
stead of the Fornarina; or Titian per-&#xD;
haps would have stolen you from me,&#xD;
and there would not have been space&#xD;
enough in the world for us both."&#xD;
Ina blushed and said: "I will tell&#xD;
you how it all was. Ah, Emanuele,&#xD;
I cannot bear to. think of it; and if&#xD;
you," she said, looking down at him&#xD;
with love and still caressing his hair,&#xD;
"did not make me forget all things,&#xD;
I should be miserable indeed. We&#xD;
were at the dinner-table,-Monsieur&#xD;
and Madame Benoni and Monsieur&#xD;
Marcello ; my two pupils had gone&#xD;
out --Adelheide and Marie- to pass&#xD;
the day at their aunt's. Madame&#xD;
Benoni looked anxiously at me and&#xD;
said, 'Are you not well, i[ademoiselle&#xD;
Strolling?' 'Yes, I am well,' I said,&#xD;
'but I have not good news from&#xD;
home.'. 'I thought,' said Madame&#xD;
Benoni, 'that you had no home, my&#xD;
dear.' 'I have none,' I said, the tears&#xD;
rising to my eyes, 'but I have a&#xD;
brother, and he is ill, and wishes me&#xD;
to come to him !' Ah, Emanuele!"&#xD;
she said, the blood rushing scarlet all&#xD;
over her face, "hide me from myself.&#xD;
I loved them all, and they were so&#xD;
kind to me, and it is terrible to me to&#xD;
think I have'deceived them so deep-&#xD;
ly. What would they say if they&#xD;
knew that I were with younow? But&#xD;
they will learn all from your lips.&#xD;
They cannot think anything you did&#xD;
was wrong; for," she said, looking up&#xD;
smiling from the arms where he had&#xD;

-how good and noble you were, that&#xD;
you were the strong staff on which&#xD;
Italy would learn to lean, that you&#xD;
were the moral standard of the cam-&#xD;
era.* How often have I seen dear&#xD;
old Monsieur Benoni put on his spec-&#xD;
tacles at the breakfast-table, and say,&#xD;
'I must look to see if our friend Ber-&#xD;
tani addressed the Chamber yester-&#xD;
day,' and. then I would listen with&#xD;
intensity to what he read; for you&#xD;
were Italy to me, and Italy was you,&#xD;

" And now," he said anxiously,&#xD;
"what will you write to      your&#xD;

piteously.&#xD;

escapes in giving it life. I cannot."&#xD;
He took her hand in his, and looked&#xD;
thoughtfully at it. "You know," he&#xD;
said, "that our marriage cannot now&#xD;
be known; that I have told you be-&#xD;
fore. The country is in an upturned&#xD;
state. I have no means, and it vould&#xD;
be a clog on me, and on my rising,&#xD;
which you desire, if it was known&#xD;
tlatf I had fettered myself. A single&#xD;
man is thought to have more time,&#xD;
to be freer to act, is less suspected of&#xD;
building up his own interests. I&#xD;
must be free before the world, and&#xD;
lie at my Aspasia's feet only in secret.&#xD;
I must be the slave of my Psyche&#xD;
only in the dark. Woe unto us, if&#xD;
the light of prying envy falls on me."&#xD;
"Ah," she said,'with a deep sigh,&#xD;
" who knows but that I shall yet be&#xD;
like the Cointhian maid whom Nero&#xD;
wooed, borne away from her home, not&#xD;
knowing her fate, to Rome, amidst&#xD;
the shouts of Cesai and Augustus;&#xD;
she hears in the cry her own doom,&#xD;
- he is lord then of the world, she&#xD;
only his slave."&#xD;
" but he lovedlher to the end,-did&#xD;
he not? If she was half as lovely as&#xD;
you, not all her rivals could take&#xD;
away even his love."&#xD;
"No," she said, sighing again; "only&#xD;
she marked his grave and placed a&#xD;
rose-tree, to bloom away oblivion."&#xD;
"And my oblivion," catching her&#xD;
to him, "shall be in your arms, my&#xD;
rose your lips, my stars your eyes,&#xD;
four love my heaven, and yourself&#xD;
my soul !" he said, pressing his lips&#xD;
to hers.. "IDo you love me," he whis-&#xD;
pered, "half as well as I do you ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Better," she said.  "I am afraid&#xD;
I love you more."&#xD;
Sofi the maid came just then to&#xD;
the porch to tell them that dinner&#xD;
was ready, - a dinner prepared by&#xD;
her own skilful hands.&#xD;
"0, how pretty !" exclaimed Ina, as&#xD;
she looked at the butter, which was&#xD;
in the form of two little doves, with&#xD;
wreaths of miniature forget-me-nots&#xD;
around their necks. There was a dish&#xD;
near her plate of birds around a small&#xD;
mountain of rice, a real Italian risot-&#xD;
to, and on the top of this was another&#xD;
bird with a pansy in his beak.' There&#xD;
were flowers around every plate, and&#xD;
Ia's and .Emanuele's napkins were&#xD;
tied in a ring of roses.&#xD;
Soft's face beamed with pleasure&#xD;
as she saw Ina's eyes brighten.&#xD;
"I hope," she said, "that Mon-&#xD;
sieur Emanuele will strew  all your&#xD;
life's path with flowers.  I should&#xD;
like to be always behind you to&#xD;
gather up the leaves."&#xD;
When Sofi had 'eft the room, Ina&#xD;
looked with some surprise at her&#xD;
husband, as if to say, How  strange&#xD;
that a servant should speak thus&#xD;
Emanuele answered her look by say-&#xD;
ing: "You must ask Sofi some da,&#xD;
Ina, to tell you all her story. You&#xD;
will, I think, make more of a friend&#xD;
of her than a servant; she will be&#xD;
a comfort to you. Poor little Sofi!&#xD;
she has seen much of this world's&#xD;
trouble."&#xD;
The dinner passed with some con-&#xD;
versation with Sofi, who answered&#xD;
all ina's questions with a mixture of&#xD;
respect and freedom. Ina had the&#xD;
delight for the ftrst time of being in&#xD;
-her own house, at the head of her&#xD;
Own table ; she felt proud .to be the&#xD;
&#xD;
mistress of her little cottage, and&#xD;
prouder still, when she glanced shyly&#xD;
across the table, to know that he&#xD;
who sat opposite and looked at her&#xD;
with so much strong love in those&#xD;
fathomless eyes wa's her master.&#xD;
After dinner they wandered around&#xD;
their tiny cage, noting all the handi-&#xD;
work and taste of Sofi; she had&#xD;
already unpacked her lady's trunk,&#xD;
had put everything just in the right&#xD;
place. Then they wandered out ann&#xD;
in arm into the dusky twilight, and&#xD;
thus they began-life together. " The&#xD;
world was all before them where to&#xD;
choose !"&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
A FEW days after Ina had been&#xD;
established in her new home,&#xD;
Emanuele and she sitting ever close&#xD;
together on their secluded porch,&#xD;
which was. one bower of wild ,roses,&#xD;
he asked her if she would not like&#xD;
to go on the lake to pass the day.&#xD;
Ina assented with readiness. She has-&#xD;
tened to her room to get her hat,&#xD;
which she arranged with some care&#xD;
before her glass. Ina was growing&#xD;
vain, for her beloved's sake ; she had&#xD;
never thought much of her looks&#xD;
before, but now she felt as if she&#xD;
would give the world to be beautiful,&#xD;
ever varying in loveliness, - that&#xD;
was wvhat he liked most, - so that she&#xD;
might ever startle and surprise him.&#xD;
She began to have a painful dread,&#xD;
sometimes, that she had not enough&#xD;
in her ever to arrest his attention;&#xD;
not that he was not to her the same&#xD;
devoted lover as at first, but that she&#xD;
understood him better every day, -&#xD;

happy!' Shakespeare alone knew&#xD;
all the chords that vibrate in the&#xD;
human heart ; he alone looked into&#xD;
the chalice of the very soul; he&#xD;
alone in the little quivering dew-drop&#xD;
saw all -the shades, of the rainbow&#xD;
and all the shadows ,of the clouds&#xD;
reflected. Immortal mind, that was&#xD;
a god on earth, if you were by me&#xD;
now, I would look up trembling into&#xD;
your face, and say, Great master, tell&#xD;
me why it is that when our cup is&#xD;
filled even to the brim with the&#xD;
sparkling' draught of pleasure and&#xD;
happiness it yet does not suffice.&#xD;
Why are we ever looking deep into&#xD;
the transparent glass, and magnify-&#xD;
ing the tiny specks, that lie almost&#xD;
invisible there at the bottom, into&#xD;
dark -winged prophecies of future&#xD;
woe? Why can we not lie in the soft&#xD;
down of perfect rest, but ever under&#xD;
the bright feathery plumage we must&#xD;
feel the restless beat of the heart&#xD;
that is panting to be free ? No, not&#xD;
yren the garden of 'Eden sufficed !&#xD;
Parth" she said, looking dreamily out&#xD;
of her window, beyond the sweet-&#xD;
brier that shut it in like a curtain&#xD;
from the curious gaze without, -&#xD;
" earth, I believe, is not enough for&#xD;
us, not space enough to breathe in;&#xD;
it is only, perhaps, the eternal, the&#xD;
ethereal vastness that knows no&#xD;
bounds that is wide enough for our&#xD;
&#xD;
his. passionate love for beauty, hi&#xD;
restless desire for ever newly opening&#xD;
charms. " What should, I do," she&#xD;
said to herself, "if I should grow&#xD;
ugly, if I should be ill, and become&#xD;
thin and pale, or old ? Would he not&#xD;
love me then, as noivW? Ah," she&#xD;
said,' with a great, sigh, 'if it were&#xD;
now to die, 't were now to be most&#xD;
&#xD;
s wings to spread themselves for flight;&#xD;
here all is subject to the iron laws of&#xD;
change and decay. Aih, Emanuele !"&#xD;
she continued, stretching out her arms&#xD;
to the distant mountains' tops, that&#xD;
were visible from where she stood,&#xD;
"would that we were there, wander-&#xD;
ing on the heights, hand in hand,&#xD;
anywhere beyond the present, for&#xD;
eternity ! I have often," she said,&#xD;
speaking her thoughts aloud, "almost&#xD;
envied Francesca di Rimini her eter-&#xD;
nal flitting through the air, with&#xD;
Paolo's arm always around her.&#xD;
What mattered it that -"&#xD;
"That it was hell ?" said a low&#xD;
voice behind her, and Emanuele Ber-&#xD;
tani caught her inhis arms.&#xD;
"I was not going to say that," she&#xD;
said, shuddering; "that it was not&#xD;
heaven I might have said, but not&#xD;
if I had, even dreamed that you had&#xD;
been so near!"&#xD;
" And why not ?" he said, as they&#xD;
went down stairs. "Am I Lance-&#xD;
lotto ?"&#xD;
"0 no," she answered, laughing;&#xD;
" but I always feel as if a wo-&#xD;
man ought never to let a man see&#xD;
the weakness she has for him; and,&#xD;
besides, do you not reirember those&#xD;
terrible words of Silvio Pellico, the&#xD;
last words of Francesca before she&#xD;
dies, 'Eternamente puniti saren' ?"*&#xD;
" But the words on PIaolo's lips, as&#xD;
he expired, were 'Eternamente ti ame-&#xD;
ro,'t and those shall be mine," he said.&#xD;
"Our love, thank God !" she an-&#xD;
swered, "may be eternal without&#xD;
fear ; - but is not that the whistle of&#xD;
the boat ? Come, Emanuele, when I&#xD;
set my heart on a thing I cannot&#xD;
* "Eternally we shall be punished."&#xD;
t '* Eternally I will love thee." .&#xD;
&#xD;
bear to be late." -They hurried on,&#xD;
and reached the boat just before the&#xD;
plank was raised. Ina was all glow-&#xD;
ing with her walk. The boat started&#xD;
and went steaming slowly down the&#xD;
exquisite lake.&#xD;
Ina was leaning on Enanuele's arm;&#xD;
she was so close to him that her head&#xD;
almost rested on his shoulder.- The&#xD;
quick walk had disarranged her hair&#xD;
slightly, and some of its little golden&#xD;
curls had escaped from her ,net, and&#xD;
were blowing across her husband's&#xD;
lips.&#xD;
"It is sweeter than the air," he&#xD;
said, as he looked down at her fond-&#xD;
ly, and then, pointing to the opposite&#xD;
side of the lake, said, " Look there at&#xD;
that mountain clad in snow."  Her&#xD;
eyes followed where his hand point-&#xD;
ed, and at the same moment she&#xD;
heard some one say in a low, sweet&#xD;
voice near her :&#xD;
"They look like the lightning and&#xD;
the thunder-cloud together,-sh so&#xD;
vivid, so bright and graceful; he so&#xD;
dark and dusky."&#xD;
"You always indulge in poetical&#xD;
ideas, my dear; she looks to me like&#xD;
a pretty German girl, and he like a&#xD;
very Italian Italian."&#xD;
Ina turned, and saw a lady dressed&#xD;
in a thick white Marseilles, buttoned&#xD;
to her throat ; a cloak of the same&#xD;
was thrown around her slight figure,&#xD;
and a broad white hat, with a long,&#xD;
sweeping green feather, shaded her&#xD;
face. The pretty colors caught Ina's&#xD;
eye first, and then suddenly she&#xD;
started a little, and blushed deeply,&#xD;
as her eye met that of the Princess,&#xD;
whom she now recognized, and who&#xD;
was looking at her with deep in-&#xD;
terest. The Princess smiled, and mna&#xD;
&#xD;
smiled and blushed again, and then&#xD;
she turned away and began watch-&#xD;
ing with intensity the clouds as they&#xD;
sailed over and settled on the moun-&#xD;
tains that surround the lake.&#xD;
"Look !"' she said. " It reminds&#xD;
me of'the description of the deluge by&#xD;
Alfred de Vigny,-do you remember?&#xD;
- when God promises to save alone&#xD;
one young man, but he sees no harm&#xD;
in bringing his heart's love with him.&#xD;
He feels as if God would be appeased,&#xD;
even when disobeyed, if he sees the&#xD;
lovely maiden by his side, and so he&#xD;
takes her up to the high mountain-&#xD;
top, which is all bathed by the mists&#xD;
that are rising from the surging-&#xD;
waters beneath ; and the waters in-&#xD;
crease. She is ever looking to her&#xD;
lover for help, not to her God, and&#xD;
each hope passes, and leaves them&#xD;
more solitary ; but, suddenly light&#xD;
breaks over her face, a white dove is&#xD;
seen winging its way to where they&#xD;
stand, their feet already wetted by&#xD;
the flood that is fast gaining on&#xD;
them; it flies nearer and nearer as&#xD;
a harbinger of peace, and then it&#xD;
sails past them, on, on, not heeding&#xD;
the lonely two who are watching it&#xD;
with such intensity. The maiden&#xD;
exclaims in her agony, 'Emanuele,&#xD;
vois-tu le colombe qui passe ?'*&#xD;
That to me," she continued ear-&#xD;
nestly, "is worse than all, worse&#xD;
than Dante's doom of remembering&#xD;
happier things ; it is better to have&#xD;
all hope gone, than going ; that 'qui&#xD;
passe' always made my blood run&#xD;
cold. A nd why," she said sudden-&#xD;
ly, "must it be just that one name&#xD;
Emanuel.? I am glad I must al-&#xD;

passes ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
ways call you in Italian, not in&#xD;
French. God with us ! you ought&#xD;
to be very good with such a beautifu]&#xD;
name. Did your mother name you&#xD;
I suppose," she said thoughtfully,&#xD;
bending her eyes on the ground,&#xD;
"that to every mother with the first-&#xD;
born son it is God with us "&#xD;
"I should like," he said, gazing at&#xD;
her with that peculiar dark look of&#xD;
light in his eyes, "to set you for a&#xD;
moment on that rock opposite us,&#xD;
with a golden comb in your hand&#xD;
to comb your golden hair, like your&#xD;
beloved Lorelei; you would lure&#xD;
again to shipwreck my little boat&#xD;
of self-love and interests on your&#xD;
shore. I think sometimes of my&#xD;
career, which sounds to me like the&#xD;
muffled drum in the distance, calling&#xD;
me from the white arims that en-&#xD;
chain me, to action, to the strife, of&#xD;
politics and the dust of work ; and I&#xD;
almost wish, that I could say with&#xD;
your poet Heine: 'Es fallen     auf&#xD;
mein Herz herab, all deine heiszen&#xD;
Liebesblicken, wie   Sonnenstrahlen&#xD;
auf emn Grab.'* Heine was great. I&#xD;
should have liked to be such a man&#xD;
as he. What cared he for the world,&#xD;
for life's shafts, for death's darkness ?&#xD;
He drank the rich draught of love&#xD;
even to the lees, he mocked at mis-&#xD;
fortune, jested with eternity, and left&#xD;
the world full of the fragrance of the&#xD;
flowers he had thrown into it."&#xD;
" How can you speak so lightly,&#xD;
so unlike yourself ? " said Ina, her&#xD;
lips trembling. "You    know   that&#xD;
Heine's life was poisonous, and that&#xD;
he lay seven years on his mattress&#xD;
grave, a victinri to himself, the poor&#xD;
* "All thy warm looks of love fall on my&#xD;
heart like the rays of the sun on a grave."&#xD;
&#xD;
worm   of the mortal body God had&#xD;
t given him."&#xD;
l   "What care I," he said, watching&#xD;
? with pleasure the varied emotions&#xD;
that were passing over her face, "for&#xD;
the end, so long as one can enjoy to&#xD;
the full, intellectually and physical-&#xD;
ly ? , So long as one's work is high&#xD;
and good, what matters it what one&#xD;
is himself?   Heine worked for his&#xD;
country, for freedom of thought and&#xD;
action, and his writings rolled like a&#xD;
fresh stream through Germany, and&#xD;
gave it new strength and life."&#xD;
"I do not believe," said Ina, "that&#xD;
any arrows that are aimed by an&#xD;
arm that is not strong can reach the&#xD;
mark; that waters which are slimy&#xD;
and muddy at the bottom can be so&#xD;
pure to drink. I will not believe that&#xD;
a good life does not strengthen good&#xD;
deeds, and turn, perhaps, aperishable&#xD;
flower into an immortelle on earth."&#xD;
" Do you think," he said, "that, if&#xD;
Victor Emanuel led a better life,&#xD;
Italy would be a higher nation ?"&#xD;
"Yes," she answered, quickly, "you&#xD;
know it would; a high king would&#xD;
make high ministers, high ministers&#xD;
better deputies, and better deputies&#xD;
a better people."&#xD;
"You forget, my love, the order of&#xD;
things," he said, laughing ; " the peo-&#xD;
ple elect the members of the Cham-&#xD;
ber, they in their turn elect the&#xD;
ministers, and the ministers sustain&#xD;
the king."&#xD;
"I do not care," she said, flushing&#xD;
scarlet. "No good influence is lost;&#xD;
the sun sheds down its colors onthe&#xD;
earth, and the earth gives back its&#xD;
dyes to the sky."&#xD;
Ina was so -earnest when she was&#xD;
interested that she forgot all things&#xD;
&#xD;
save the subject which she was dis-&#xD;
cussing ; but just then she raised her&#xD;
eyes, and met those of the Princess&#xD;
fixed on her. The Princess turned&#xD;
away her face quickly, but not before&#xD;
Ina had seen a tear glistening on her&#xD;
cheek. Ina turned away too, and sat&#xD;
silently looking into the white foam&#xD;
that the boat made as she steamed&#xD;
on. She was, wondering why the&#xD;
Princess looked so sadly at her, but&#xD;
her woman's heart answered    her&#xD;
quickly that she was alone. Two of&#xD;
her ladies sat at a respectful distance&#xD;
from her; etiquette did not allow her&#xD;
to talk freely with them, and her&#xD;
bridegroom was standing at the end&#xD;
of the deck looking into nothingness,&#xD;
and knocking the ashes of his cigar&#xD;
into the waters of the lake. " Could&#xD;
she be envying me ?" said Ina to&#xD;
herself. " She might well do so, if a&#xD;
princess's heart can envy, for have I&#xD;
not the perfect love and companion-&#xD;
ship of my husband ? We are, both,&#xD;
she and I, starting for the race of&#xD;
life at about the same age, at the&#xD;
same time, under the same given cir-&#xD;
cumstances; but I fear her path is&#xD;
burnished with gold, mine gilded by&#xD;
the rays of the sun; hers will glitter&#xD;
with precious stones, mine with the&#xD;
raindrops that fall aslant from the&#xD;
rainbow. Poor thing ! how I should&#xD;
like to run to her, and kiss away&#xD;
the tear that stood on her soft cheek&#xD;
- and she would think me mad if&#xD;
I did ! yet are we not the same&#xD;
blood, made by the same hand, both&#xD;
women, both educated ? why should&#xD;
there be such a barrier between us ?"&#xD;
"Emanuele," she said, suddenly,&#xD;
"have you ever spoken with the&#xD;
King ?2"  ,&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
"Many times," he answered,laugh-&#xD;
ing. "What makes you think of the&#xD;
King now?"&#xD;
"Is he affable, kind, cordial, or&#xD;
distant and haughty?"&#xD;
"He is perfectly natural, very kind-&#xD;
hearted, simple in his manners, very&#xD;
intelligent, and -"&#xD;
"And does he talk to you like&#xD;
every one else ? "&#xD;
"Necessarily some forms have to&#xD;
be gone through .on entering his&#xD;
presence, but, these apart, one feels,&#xD;
I think, easier with him than with&#xD;
most men."&#xD;
"What a pity he is so bad !" said&#xD;
Ina, quickly.&#xD;
" He is very brave, very gener-&#xD;
ous   "&#xD;
" With money," said Ina, "that he&#xD;
robs from his poor people."&#xD;
" You are hard on our re galant'&#xD;
uoimo," said Bertani, laughing.&#xD;
Ina did not answer. They were&#xD;
nearing Fluelen, that most lovely&#xD;
vista of mountains, which is at the&#xD;
extreme end of the lake. The boat&#xD;
drew up to the pier, and there was&#xD;
a general rush to cross the plank.&#xD;
Ina stood back and watched the&#xD;
Princess as she took the arm of the&#xD;
Prince and walked away. Just as&#xD;
she had gone, Ina saw 'on the seat&#xD;
she had occupied a little book lying.&#xD;
She knew it belonged to the Princess,&#xD;
for she had seen it in her hand.&#xD;
She slipped her arm hastily out of&#xD;
Emanuele's, ran over to the empty&#xD;
seat of the Princess, and took the&#xD;
volume. It was a small book bound&#xD;
in Russia leather, with gold edges,&#xD;
and a crown in gold and three initials&#xD;
under it on the back ; it looked like&#xD;
a note-book, being much longer than&#xD;
&#xD;
INA.                             17&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8231-00000011"/>&#xD;
1s                                INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
it was wide, and with a golden clasp&#xD;
to' it. Ina looked down on it ten-&#xD;
derly; she felt almost as if she held&#xD;
the Princess's hand in hers. She&#xD;
walked thoughtfully on by Eman-&#xD;
uele's side. They sat down under&#xD;
the trees in a little shady place, and&#xD;
Emanuele covered Ina with rose-&#xD;
leaves, which he pulled from the&#xD;
wild roses that grew over her head ;&#xD;
and then they threw roses at each&#xD;
other, and Ina laughed like a child,&#xD;
and Emanuele told her that he might&#xD;
do her harm in taking her for one&#xD;
of the flowers herself, and she was&#xD;
happy with him, and he was proud&#xD;
of her, and Ina said: "I wonder&#xD;
what the Princess is doing now,&#xD;
if any flowers have fallen into her&#xD;
lap. Ah, Emanuele, how     terrible&#xD;
golden chains are 1 and think of&#xD;
having one's roses of rubies only,&#xD;
and the leaves of enamel, and the,&#xD;
dew-drops only of diamonds. I think&#xD;
I should. wet them  then with my&#xD;
own tears often; one cannot have&#xD;
all things in this life."~&#xD;
He drew her face fondly to him,&#xD;
and said, "Few would hesitate to&#xD;
choose the glitter before the per-&#xD;
fume."&#xD;
" But you," she said, anxiously,"-&#xD;
"which would you prefer ?"&#xD;
"I will wait till I am tempted,"&#xD;
he said, " before I answer that ques-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
Ina was only half satisfied with&#xD;
his answer, but they were hastening&#xD;
to the boat, which was waiting .for&#xD;
their arrival to raise the plank. - Ina&#xD;
looked around to see if the:Princess&#xD;
was there.' Her back was turned to&#xD;
her, and the Prince was by her&#xD;
side; they were talking together.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ina would not for the world have,&#xD;
interrupted them. She waited until&#xD;
the Prince had left her side, then&#xD;
she scarcely dared approach her,&#xD;
for Ina was timid .by nature. In a&#xD;
moment more she saw the Princess&#xD;
start slightly, put her hand hastily&#xD;
in her pocket as if searching for&#xD;
something, and then look anxiously&#xD;
on the ground, Ina slipped from&#xD;
Emanuele's side and approached the&#xD;
Princess.&#xD;
" I trust you will pardon me," said&#xD;
Ina, "but I found this book, for which&#xD;
I fear you have been searching, on&#xD;
the ground just near where you were&#xD;
sitting." Ina spoke in German. The&#xD;
Princess turned at the sound of her&#xD;
voice, her face lighted by a smile so&#xD;
lovely that Ina thought her beauti-&#xD;
ful, - it irradiated all her face, as&#xD;
if a sunbeam had suddenly shone&#xD;
on it.&#xD;
"I thank you so verynmuch."&#xD;
Ina made a movement as if to go.&#xD;
The Irincess made a slight motion&#xD;
with her hand, as if she still had&#xD;
something to say to her. Ina waited.&#xD;
"Ilam glad I lost my little book,"&#xD;
she said, "since it has given me an&#xD;
opportunity of speaking with you;&#xD;
ever since I first saw you at the&#xD;
window I have felt my heart go out&#xD;
to you!"&#xD;
" And mine to you," said Ina with&#xD;
warmth, and blushing.&#xD;
The Princess smiled  again, and&#xD;
said: " How    often have -I chafed&#xD;
against the chains of etiquette which&#xD;
bound me, when I wanted to runm&#xD;
over to you, and speak to you as to&#xD;
a sister. It is strange, the elec-.&#xD;
tric chord that draws us to some&#xD;
persons ! It is so seldom that I feel&#xD;
&#xD;
it, but when I do it is all-power-&#xD;
ful."&#xD;
"I have often wished," said Ina,&#xD;
"that you were not a princess, that&#xD;
I might come and put .my arms&#xD;
about your neck"&#xD;
A shade passed over the young&#xD;
Princess's face, and she said quickly:&#xD;
"We are of the same dust; you&#xD;
too are on your bridal tour ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Ina, coloring this time&#xD;
to her brow.&#xD;
"I feared," said the Princess, "you&#xD;
might think me very rude, I looked&#xD;
at you so much, but there are times&#xD;
7 when we feel an irresistible interest&#xD;
to know from' whence and where&#xD;
bound is the life of another ; it is&#xD;
not curiosity."&#xD;
"Yes," said Ina, thoughtfully ; -"the&#xD;
face does not tell us enough, we long&#xD;
to look into he very heart."&#xD;
"How sad it is," said the Princess,&#xD;
"that our paths on earth deviate so!&#xD;
We catch a glimpse of a.life, and we,&#xD;
must leave it as a picture, enly 6e&#xD;
never think of the, ingnirate one&#xD;
tWith any movie longings, we accept&#xD;
it as 'it stands before our eyes, we&#xD;
neither would take from nor add to&#xD;
i; but it is different with the living&#xD;
painting, it dissolves before our view&#xD;
and leaves us with an indefinite long-&#xD;
ing,-it is like an unfinished poem."&#xD;
"Yes," said Ina, " we long to know&#xD;
if.the person is happy or unhappy."&#xD;
"If she was a beloved wife, and&#xD;
blessed as a mother," said the Prin-&#xD;
cess, with a smile which had some-&#xD;
thing of sadness in it, as she looked&#xD;
at Ina. ,&#xD;
" I shall know of your blessings,"&#xD;
.said Ina, smiling brightly,-"they will&#xD;
go forth through all countries ; and&#xD;
&#xD;
if," she said, hesitatingly,-- "if you&#xD;
are ever perfectly happy folding in&#xD;
your arms all that is best and sweet-&#xD;
est in life, will you let your thoughts&#xD;
wander a moment from the fulness&#xD;
around you to remember one who&#xD;
once met you, felt all her. heart&#xD;
drawn towards you, and who will be&#xD;
reading of and rejoicing with glad&#xD;
tears in her eyes over your happi-,&#xD;
ness ?"&#xD;
The tears rushed to th6 Princess's&#xD;
eyes, she could not speak, but she&#xD;
pressed her hand over Ina's, which&#xD;
lay on the bench at her side; hers&#xD;
was sparkling with jewels, Ina's had&#xD;
one little plain gold ring on the&#xD;
marriage finger. They sat for a mo-&#xD;
merit thus. Ina raised htr eyes,&#xD;
and looked 'across the boat. Eman-&#xD;
uele was standing leaning carelessly&#xD;
against one of the pillars that sup-&#xD;
ported the little deck, his face was&#xD;
averted.-&#xD;
"How   strong he   looks!"  she&#xD;
thought; "how handsome he is'!"&#xD;
He turned, and their eyes met.. Ina&#xD;
lose. " I must go," she said.&#xD;
"Shall we never meet again ?" the&#xD;
Princess said sadly.&#xD;
" J  ust so," said Ia; "but wheth-&#xD;
er eve do or no, I shall never forget&#xD;
you."&#xD;
The Princess looked hastily down ;&#xD;
she unclasped a gold circle that was&#xD;
around her wrist, and said almost&#xD;
timidly to Ina, "Will you wear this&#xD;
in memory of me?"&#xD;
Ina clasped it around her arm, and,&#xD;
saying "Believe me, I will wear it&#xD;
as long as I. live," left the Princess's&#xD;
side, and went back to her husband.&#xD;
" How long you have been !" said&#xD;
Emanuele.; " I missed you; we have&#xD;

marriage ; I felt lost without my&#xD;
little Ina."&#xD;
"And I too am so happy to be&#xD;
with you again," she said, looking up&#xD;
into his' face. " The Princess is love-&#xD;
ly. I understood for the firsttime,&#xD;
when with her, the feeling of loyalty&#xD;
to one's queen; I thought I would&#xD;
have died for her!"&#xD;
"-Then," he said, laughing, "you&#xD;
will pardon henceforth with more&#xD;
ease my devotion to my king."&#xD;
" Ah," she said, pouting prettily,&#xD;
"that is different. Victor Emanuel&#xD;
does not deserve the feeling."&#xD;
" wait," he said, "until I present&#xD;
my little bride to him; royalty is&#xD;
infectious."&#xD;
"I will never," said ,Ina, drawing&#xD;
herself up with a slightly proud look,&#xD;
-" I will never speak to him ; not&#xD;
because there is a difference in our&#xD;
positions, I do not feel that, but he&#xD;
is a man I have no respect for."&#xD;
Emanuele's brow knitted for a&#xD;
moment, and then he turned away,&#xD;
saying,  " You  shall .o - as you&#xD;
please."     -&#xD;
A violent rain came on, and they&#xD;
were obliged to seek what shelter,&#xD;
they could. The boat drew up at&#xD;
last to the wharf. Ina was dripping-&#xD;
ly wet, her hair had fallen around her&#xD;
face, and Emanuele hurried her off&#xD;
the boat. The last she saw of the&#xD;
Princess was just as she was getting&#xD;
into the coach that was awaiting her.&#xD;
Ina was holding up her clothes, and&#xD;
gathering herself as well as she could&#xD;
under-the umbrella that her husband&#xD;
was holding ; she caught the eye of&#xD;
the Princess, and looked back laugh-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE first thing that Ina saw on&#xD;
reaching home was Sofi standing&#xD;
in the door-looking out for them, and&#xD;
holding back a beautiful white dog.&#xD;
"Sardo," called Emanuele.&#xD;
The dog uttered a cry of joy, and .&#xD;
bounded away from Sofi to his mas-&#xD;
ter.. ' Ina looked at. him with delight,&#xD;
He was about half as large as a large'&#xD;
Newfoundland, his legs and his back&#xD;
were closely clipped, and the rest of&#xD;
his hair was long and glistened like&#xD;
snow; a bright blue ribbon tied&#xD;
just over his eyes gave him an air of&#xD;
coquetry which pleased Ina. le&#xD;
sprang all over his master like a mad&#xD;
creature, and then, seemingly recog-&#xD;
nizing Ina as something that belonged&#xD;
to Emanuele, he turned and licked&#xD;
the hand which was caressing him.&#xD;
" 0  you   beauty !"  she  said.&#xD;
"Where : did he come from? Did&#xD;
you send for him, Emanuele? fHow&#xD;
good you are !"&#xD;
"When did the man bring him?".&#xD;
said Emanuele.&#xD;
" Just after you had gone, sir."&#xD;
"I thought," said Emanuele, " that&#xD;
he would be such a pretty picture by&#xD;
your side, You know I am an artist&#xD;
in all but the power of execution,&#xD;
and ever since we came here I have&#xD;
been painting you and Sardo 'in my&#xD;
mind's eye' together. There," lie&#xD;
said, standing away from them a little,&#xD;
" you look like everything that is&#xD;
lovely and mythological. It was not&#xD;
truly a desire to see my dog, but to&#xD;
see you two together."&#xD;
" What an odd idea!" said na,&#xD;
laughing. "0, what has Sardo got in&#xD;
his mouth ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
Ie came straight to Ina  id hand-&#xD;
ed her her haPdkerchief. She took it&#xD;
from him, and saw that he had held&#xD;
it so delicately in his mouth as not&#xD;
to tear the muslin at all.&#xD;
" Come here !"  said  Emanuele;&#xD;
"take my watch, sir, and give it to&#xD;
La Padrona !"I&#xD;
The dog went to him, put his twoi&#xD;
fore paws on his knees, and, taking&#xD;
his watch out of his pocket with his&#xD;
teeth, unfastened the chain from his&#xD;
button-hole, and then handed it care-&#xD;
fully to Ina.&#xD;
"0, how I shall love him !" said&#xD;
Ina, enchanted.&#xD;
"Walk on your hind legs ! " said&#xD;
Emanuele. The dog obeyed. "Go&#xD;
and kiss La Padrona!" The dog looked&#xD;
at his master, as if to say, that is an&#xD;
easy task, and went over to Ina, and&#xD;
gave her a most loving caress. "Give&#xD;
her your paw, sir ! the other ! now the&#xD;
other !" The dog obeyed. " Fall down&#xD;
dead!"  The' dog uttered a whine,&#xD;
and stretched himself at Ina's feet.&#xD;
"Ah," she said, growing pale, "poor&#xD;
thing ! something really is the mat-&#xD;
ter with him !" Emanuele laughed.&#xD;
"Come in to dinner," said Sofi;&#xD;
"you cannot feed on love, and you&#xD;
have had nothing else, I believe, all&#xD;
day."&#xD;
They went in to dine, followed by&#xD;
Sardo, who had sprung to his feet at&#xD;
the sound of Sofi's voice.&#xD;
They had been but a few minutes&#xD;
at the table when Ina heard a strange&#xD;
noise; she looked up and saw Sardo&#xD;
trying to get the keys out of the&#xD;
pantry lock. He soon succeeded, and&#xD;
came all joy, wagging his tail, to&#xD;
bring them to her.&#xD;
" Take this bone," said Erianuele,&#xD;
&#xD;
" but do not eat it on the carpet!"&#xD;
The dog walked immediately to a&#xD;
place near the hearth, where the&#xD;
floor was bare, and began crunching&#xD;
his bone.&#xD;
"0," said Ina, playfully, " I never&#xD;
saw so charming a dog. I shall love&#xD;
him better than you. He has the&#xD;
most beautiful eyes I ever saw."&#xD;
Just then she looked up, and&#xD;
caught her husband's fixed on her, as&#xD;
she was bending over Sardo, wits ad-&#xD;
miration and love.. "Except," she&#xD;
said, blushing, " yours."&#xD;
"I thank you," he said. "I will&#xD;
exchange with Sardo."&#xD;
"I wonder," said Ina, thoughtfully,&#xD;
"if dogs have a heaven of their own&#xD;
to go to; they must have souls,--&#xD;
they are so full of love, they dream,&#xD;
they die for those they love, they&#xD;
are more faithful than men."&#xD;
" I do not believe," said Emanuele,&#xD;
"in the necessity of a heaven ; he has&#xD;
that on' earth at your feet: and as&#xD;
for fidelity, my love, look not for it in&#xD;
this world; be content if you find&#xD;
constancy!"&#xD;
" I do not understand the differ-&#xD;
ence," said Ina. " I will look it out&#xD;
in the dictionary."&#xD;
"Seek for it, my Ira, in the dic-&#xD;
tionary of life; there you will see it&#xD;
admirably defined: fidelity not exist-&#xD;
ing, the word 'is not to be found;&#xD;
constancy, a certain fondness always&#xD;
for one, despite of a great deal of in-&#xD;
fidelity ; infidelity, a constant ten-&#xD;
dency to roam in one's affections, and&#xD;
with no sense of constancy. .Do you&#xD;
understand the difference now ?"&#xD;
"I do not like your definitions at&#xD;
all," said Ina, sadly. "I do not want&#xD;
to hear about it."&#xD;

"That is a pretty conception, and&#xD;
true," he said, " of Aleardo Aleardis,&#xD;
in his- patriotic songs; do you re-&#xD;
member it? The lover loves his&#xD;
mistress and she loves him, and all&#xD;
the hours of their ecstasy are paint-&#xD;
ed so that you feel them; then one&#xD;
night he is dragged in a car past&#xD;
her window, where her lovely head&#xD;
lies unconsciously sleeping amidst&#xD;
the perfumed linen of her bed; he&#xD;
draws on his grating, with Giotto's&#xD;
consoling art, her features, and he&#xD;
is no more alone ; they erects his&#xD;
scaffold in the dull marshes, and a&#xD;
little bird comes and settles on it&#xD;
and sings gayly on the dark beam,&#xD;
and the early anemones had 'scarce&#xD;
budded over the ditch, his friend&#xD;
says, where he saw his body thrown,&#xD;
when thou also, 0 lady, didst sing,&#xD;
rejoicing, alas ! in a new love."&#xD;
"I wish," said Ina, flushing, "that&#xD;
you would not say those things with&#xD;
so much feeling ; we all know that&#xD;
there are bad women, that there are&#xD;
Cressidas and Clytemnestras and&#xD;
Lady Hamlets; but that does not&#xD;
make out the world of women faith-&#xD;
less."&#xD;
"I believe," he'said, "that I am&#xD;
the only man that can cry out Eu-&#xD;
reka."&#xD;
"I will not," said Ina, "accept a&#xD;
compliment sofalse, and at the ex-&#xD;
pense, too, of all my sex. I will not&#xD;
be so disloyal. Take it back, air ;&#xD;
think well of all, or not of me!"&#xD;
" Then I should love all perforce,"&#xD;
"No, no," she answered, "that is&#xD;
not a necessary consequence at 'all.&#xD;
I want you to say when you die, like&#xD;
De Mauprat, ' Je n'ai jamais aim6&#xD;
&#xD;
qu'une tame! et jamais je n'ai&#xD;
enti que l'dtreinte de sa main !'&#xD;
One ,day passed like another with&#xD;
our hero and     heroine. The days&#xD;
melted into each other like)rainbow&#xD;
tints, full of everything and noth-&#xD;
ing. In the evenings they generally&#xD;
strolled out to walk; often Emanuele&#xD;
read to Ina, while she sat embroider.&#xD;
ing under the trees, with Sardo at&#xD;
her (eet, and then he would throw&#xD;
down his book and come and lie&#xD;
down on the grass too with Sardo,&#xD;
and she would play ,with his dark&#xD;
hair, and they would talk of their&#xD;
future, and their love immeasura-&#xD;
ble; and so the days sped on, one&#xD;
losing itself in the other's dye. Ina&#xD;
often looked for the Princess, but she&#xD;
never met her again, and so 'she&#xD;
knew that she had gone away; she&#xD;
felt lonelier, though, when she knew&#xD;
that it was so.&#xD;
One evening as they strayed out&#xD;
on the shore, Ina gathering shells&#xD;
to make a collar for Sardo, who was&#xD;
carrying her book in his mouth, they&#xD;
saw a little row-boat pass empty.&#xD;
Emanuele hailed it, and soon Ina and&#xD;
he sat side by side whilst the oars&#xD;
silvered the water with their stroke,&#xD;
and threw evanescent pearls into Ina's&#xD;
hand, as she was passing it through&#xD;
the soft ripples. All was still; the&#xD;
stars were burning their clear tapers&#xD;
in the sky. Sardo was at Ina's feet.&#xD;
They both sat a long time silent.&#xD;
At last Ina said : "Is not this like&#xD;
eternity, Emanuele ? so still, so peace-&#xD;
ful, with a sense so perfect of repose,&#xD;
and yet with no monotony; all&#xD;
hushed the din and noise of life,&#xD;
and yet love enveloping'one as with&#xD;
a -great mantle, which warms and&#xD;
&#xD;
weighs not upon the heart. The ciark-&#xD;
ness is forgetfulness of past troubles,&#xD;
which it shuts out;, the freshness&#xD;
of the waters is eternal youth. The&#xD;
stars are faith and hope lighted in&#xD;
our horizon. The oarsman, as we&#xD;
see him now transfigured by the dim&#xD;
light, is our guide to knowledhrm  Is&#xD;
it not like eternity, Emanete ?"&#xD;
"I do not believe," he said slowly,&#xD;
"in the immortality of the soul.&#xD;
Therefore I cannot believe in   an&#xD;
eternity, save as an eternal material&#xD;
reproduction of life on earth."&#xD;
"Emanuele," she   said, growing&#xD;
deadly pale, "do not say so, do not&#xD;
speak thus !" and she clung beseech-&#xD;
ingly to his arm, and looked up pit-&#xD;
eously into his face.&#xD;
He passed his arm around her&#xD;
waist, and. drew  her beating heart&#xD;
nearer to h4m.&#xD;
"Yes, 4a, I tell you the truth.&#xD;
I think that one lives here as a God ;&#xD;
one has infinite knowledge, the in-&#xD;
tensity of love, the delight of in-&#xD;
tellectual force, and even the incense&#xD;
of worship always at least from some&#xD;
one soul."&#xD;
"What do you call a soul? " said&#xD;
Ina, impetuously.&#xD;
" The light that is within us."&#xD;
"Whence does it come ?" said Ina,&#xD;
catching her breath.&#xD;
He did not answer.&#xD;
"Where does it go ?" she con-&#xD;
tinued.&#xD;
"It is extinguished like a lamp,&#xD;
and then all goes ouf. Some of the&#xD;
greatest of men have not believed, -&#xD;
men like Voltaire, Hume, Gibbon."&#xD;
"And how have they died ?" she&#xD;
said. " Without hope, with cringing&#xD;
fear, which they dared not reveaL.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ah ! well did Byron say, Give me, if&#xD;
you can, a solace as sweet as the faith&#xD;
you take from me ; if it be false, then&#xD;
at the end I have only your dull&#xD;
tiny,  if it be true, I have its im-&#xD;
mense consolation here, and unor-&#xD;
tality hereafter.' Do not say the&#xD;
greatest men; men like Socrates,&#xD;
Marcus Aurelius -great souls that&#xD;
could not die -even without a light&#xD;
to guide them, knew no darkness.&#xD;
Michael Angelo, William of Orange,&#xD;
Washington, Sir Philip Sidney, - if&#xD;
the greatest means the highest, the&#xD;
noblest and the best, they believed."&#xD;
"The greatest means those that&#xD;
were sufficient unto themselves," he&#xD;
answered,-" men who knew so much&#xD;
that they felt the need of no God,&#xD;
like your own Goethe ; his intellect&#xD;
pierced the great veil of mystery,&#xD;
and shed its own sun around. That&#xD;
is but a figurative expression in the&#xD;
Bible, that God made the light ; each&#xD;
man sheds his own light, - if -it be&#xD;
small, he is a worm; if it be great,&#xD;
he is a God."&#xD;
"Goethe cried out for more light&#xD;
at the end," she'said ; " if it were as&#xD;
you say, then he would not have felt&#xD;
that want. But I do not believe it&#xD;
was as unbelievers think ; I believe&#xD;
only his earthly eyes strained them-&#xD;
selves to see once more the sun, as&#xD;
we gaze at a face more intensely&#xD;
from which we are parting. Goethe&#xD;
believed ; a thousand things make&#xD;
me know it."&#xD;
"Why, Ia, nothing dies in one&#xD;
sense, because it is recreated in some&#xD;
other form; this is the economy of&#xD;
nature, this is its wonderful mystery. /&#xD;
The whole earth throbs with life.&#xD;
Perhaps my intellect will fly to new&#xD;
&#xD;

matter, and be again a man, and&#xD;
think and know ; it may live in a&#xD;
book, and thus give forth light which&#xD;
may ignite- the . spark that would&#xD;
otherwise be dead : and as for my&#xD;
body, that returns to flowers, that&#xD;
blossoms in the trees, in the long&#xD;
waving grass."&#xD;
"Ah !" said Ina, with a great sigh&#xD;
of pain ; " and tell me, what do you&#xD;
think of Christ ? "&#xD;
" That he was a great, good man,&#xD;
whose presence was necessary to&#xD;
purify the world."_&#xD;
O, tell me," she said, " in all the&#xD;
history of this world was there ever&#xD;
another, who in poverty, without&#xD;
power, without arms, without learn-&#xD;
ing, young, alone, in a short time won&#xD;
a kingdom upon earth -that no time&#xD;
can destroy ? Was it not from an&#xD;
inspiration beyond, above ? Mahom-&#xD;
et came, and was great, a leader,&#xD;
with great knowledge, with 'arms,&#xD;
'and' yet he could win for himself&#xD;
followers only through the hopes&#xD;
of conquest and the promises of&#xD;
blood."&#xD;
"I do not know," he said, stroking&#xD;
her flushed cheek, " of a thing on&#xD;
earth that should make me wish more&#xD;
for immortality than to live on,&#xD;
through unknown time and space,&#xD;
with -iy Ina; but this cannot be;&#xD;
therefore let us live to-day, for to-&#xD;
morrow we die."&#xD;
"Ah, Emanuele," she said, with a&#xD;
suppressed sob ; " whydid you never&#xD;
say these things to me before ?&#xD;
My paradise on earth seems gone,&#xD;
and I shall ever wearily stand now&#xD;
without the doors."&#xD;
" Perhaps," he said, "you may&#xD;
gain admittance, like the poor peri;&#xD;
&#xD;
-~IN&#xD;
&#xD;
I you can bring my soul at last, and&#xD;
then the gates will open, and we&#xD;
shall be together yet. Would that&#xD;
.not be a prize worth striving for?"&#xD;
" Ah, say that you have jested&#xD;
with me ! " she said, throwing her head&#xD;
passionately on his shoulder, "say&#xD;
that you believe ; say that, and I&#xD;
shall be happy once more."&#xD;
"Then I. will believe," he said.&#xD;
I will believe blindly. I will ac-&#xD;
cept any doctrine you choose, only&#xD;
do not let us talk again of these&#xD;
things. We are here to love one&#xD;
another, not to discuss and argue the&#xD;
great theories of life ; leave those to&#xD;
men, but let a beautiful woman be&#xD;
our rest, our haven."&#xD;
Ina longed to answer that she saw&#xD;
no matter too deep or too serious for'&#xD;
a man to speak of to a woman who&#xD;
was his companion; but although he&#xD;
was her lover always, yet there were&#xD;
times when she felt it were best not&#xD;
to use her power, and she knew this&#xD;
.now ; so she felt already like the&#xD;
peri, shut out fromim who was her&#xD;
heaven, and she was desolate and&#xD;
alone. But when they came home,&#xD;
and Emanuele drew her to him and&#xD;
kissed her eyes and whispered in her&#xD;
ear words of love, then she forgot all&#xD;
things save that he loved her ; only&#xD;
once vhen they were sitting looking&#xD;
up at the skies, he said, " I used&#xD;
to think, when I was a boy, that we&#xD;
went there when we died !" She&#xD;
shuddered and clung closer to him.&#xD;
And so the days and weeks rolled on&#xD;
into months. Ina used to think some-&#xD;
times that Emanuele needed more va-&#xD;
riety, work, or companionship. Once&#xD;
she said to him: "When shall we go&#xD;
to Turin ? Do you not think it wonNd&#xD;
&#xD;
be well to go soon ? The summer&#xD;
days are almost. past.  0, let me&#xD;
write,' dear Emanuele, and tell our&#xD;
good friends the Benonis where we&#xD;
are, that I am your wife ; at least, if&#xD;
the world may not know it yet, do&#xD;
not let me keep up a deception be-&#xD;
fore them. I have not written once&#xD;
since that first letter ; it is so dread-&#xD;
ful to me to play a part that is&#xD;
false."&#xD;
Emanuele looked at her as she had&#xD;
never, seen him  before ; his eyes&#xD;
darkened, whilst a red, angry color&#xD;
spread itself over his face, but he&#xD;
said quietly': "'Ina, do you not trust&#xD;
me wholly ? Our marriage cannot be&#xD;
known as yet. I have given you&#xD;
once my reasons. I owe it to my&#xD;
country to work for her, and to be&#xD;
free to do so. Come here," he said,&#xD;
"and give me both your hands."&#xD;
She came to him and put her&#xD;
hands in his. "Promise me - your&#xD;
word is enough - that until I say to&#xD;
you that it is well to speak, no ohe&#xD;
shall know of our relations to each&#xD;
other'&#xD;
Ina was silent; she stood lookin&#xD;
steadily at him, very pale, and th n&#xD;
said slowly, " I promise you."&#xD;
" I thank you," he said, drawing&#xD;
her head down to him, and kissing&#xD;
her hair, "for you have shown per-&#xD;
'fect confidence in me."&#xD;
Ina was pensive, and Emanuele&#xD;
said to her: " Tell me, my love,&#xD;
what you are thinking of."&#xD;
"I was thinking," she said, " at&#xD;
that moment, of Alfred de Musset, of&#xD;
his words, ' J'aime et je veux souffrir.'&#xD;
I do not like it, yet perhaps when&#xD;
one loves intensely one always suf-&#xD;
fers; no rose that has not thorns has&#xD;

A.                             25&#xD;
fragrance, and yet it is sad that it&#xD;
must be so."&#xD;
"My motto is," said Emanuele,&#xD;
' J'aime et je veux jouir.'"&#xD;
"That is worse than the other,"&#xD;
said Ina, shaking her head. "Do&#xD;
you know what I should choose foi&#xD;
myself if I were a man ? 'J'aime et&#xD;
je veux lutter'; that is one's only&#xD;
strength - to battle, and then to die !"&#xD;
" According to your ideas, one&#xD;
would have to be like the knight&#xD;
of Delorges, and seek his lady's&#xD;
gauntlet among lions and leopards."&#xD;
"No," said Ina; "I mean only a&#xD;
moral gladiator."&#xD;
" Come here, Sardo, give your mis-+&#xD;
tress a . kiss, and tell her not- to&#xD;
be thinking of these great questions;&#xD;
that they will make heir little head&#xD;
ache."&#xD;
Sardo went up to Ina al he was&#xD;
commanded, and did his best to dis-&#xD;
perse her thoughts.&#xD;
But Ina had grown paler of late,&#xD;
the oung rounded look of'maiden-&#xD;
ho d had somewhat left her face,&#xD;
a d    re was less of laughter in&#xD;
er deep blue eyes. "Come," said&#xD;
anuele, "come out with ie to&#xD;
wal under the trees; the air is fresh,&#xD;
t 1e day is bright, and you look as if&#xD;
you would feel better for, the '-exer-&#xD;
cise.&#xD;
Ina took up her hat languidly, and&#xD;
put her arm in his; they walked&#xD;
on silently until they came to some&#xD;
large forest-trees.  a lookedI tired,&#xD;
and Emanuele drew her down on the&#xD;
seat which was under \them, all in&#xD;
the shade.&#xD;
"Tell me," he said, bending over&#xD;
her, "have you no secret all your&#xD;
own to tell me ?"&#xD;

Ina turned away her face.&#xD;
"Anima mia," he said, " will you&#xD;
not whisper one word in my ear ?"&#xD;
She burst"into tears, and flung hei&#xD;
arms about his neck, hiding her face&#xD;
all flushed, on his shoulder.&#xD;
He stroked back her curls, and&#xD;
she, nestling closer to him, said&#xD;
with stammering voice : " Emanuele,&#xD;
should you be happy if it were so ?&#xD;
would you love me more ?    I am&#xD;
so happy, only I feared to. tell&#xD;
you.       .&#xD;
"I could not love you better," he&#xD;
said, "I could not be even happier&#xD;
than I am, but I am glad of all that&#xD;
you are glad of."&#xD;
"Ah," she said, with a great sigh&#xD;
of rel ef, " I am glad you spoke to&#xD;
me.    never should have had the&#xD;
cour ge to speak to you. I am not&#xD;
afr d of you," she said, laughing,&#xD;
" and yet I am. Do you know,"&#xD;
looking up at him very solemnly,&#xD;
"what I think would be happiest of&#xD;
all? It has been so often in my,&#xD;
heart of late,-to die just at that&#xD;
most blessed moment, you near me:&#xD;
I would place it in your arms, and&#xD;
then it would be soe sweet to close&#xD;
one's eyes and rest. It is cowardly&#xD;
of me, -'is it not ?- to shrink from&#xD;
life ; but I am so afraid to live, and&#xD;
I do not know why."&#xD;
"It is cruel of you," he said, "not&#xD;
to think of me. Do I not make you&#xD;
happy, my belove  that you should&#xD;
have such though ? "&#xD;
" o  yes," she murmured, "stoo&#xD;
happy; it cannot - t, nothing here&#xD;
endures."        /&#xD;
" It .is only because you are not&#xD;
well, Ina, that you *have gloomy&#xD;
fancies," he answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was but a few days after this&#xD;
' that Ina was sitting alone in her&#xD;
little parlor, listening for Emanuele's&#xD;
r footstep ; he had gone out to the&#xD;
post-office. The leaves had fallen&#xD;
away from the vine that clad the&#xD;
cottage, where he had brought her&#xD;
as his bride in the early spring. The&#xD;
air was so fresh now that the win-&#xD;
dows could no longer be left open,&#xD;
but Ina could see far down the path&#xD;
that led to the house, now that the&#xD;
view was no longer obstructed by&#xD;
the summer roses ; the last one had&#xD;
dropped long since away, and it&#xD;
looked less lovely now  than then,&#xD;
Presently Ina saw her husband com-&#xD;
ing slowly up the path ; he had a&#xD;
letter in  his hand which he was&#xD;
reading attentively, and his brow was&#xD;
overcast. She ran to the window, but&#xD;
he did not look up at her ; she opened&#xD;
the door, and went forward to meet&#xD;
him; he seemed troubled.&#xD;
"Emanuele, do tell me if you have&#xD;
any bad news !"&#xD;
"None," he said, quietly. "Ihave&#xD;
a letter here which recalls me to&#xD;
Turin, and immediately."&#xD;
" Then we shall go," she said. "I&#xD;
am glad."&#xD;
" You cannot come, Ina."&#xD;
" And why not ?" she said, looking&#xD;
up with a frightened look into his&#xD;
face, --"why not ? ",&#xD;
" It is impossible; you will stay&#xD;
here until I come back."&#xD;
"I cannot stay here alone," she&#xD;
said, with  almost despair in her&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
."Ina," he said, taking her hand in&#xD;
his, "you will not shrink from your&#xD;
duty; youwill do that which is best for&#xD;
us both. I do not want you to sadden&#xD;
&#xD;
last moments; be yourself.    I&#xD;
1sha1 not be long away.&#xD;
She turned away to hide her tears,&#xD;
but said quietly, " I will do whatever&#xD;
you wish."  The next day Emanuele&#xD;
was to leave at nine o'clock. Ina&#xD;
tried to keep up to the very last. He&#xD;
lookedat his watch as they sat to-&#xD;
gether the last morning ; it was ten&#xD;
minutes of nine,-Ina saw it by the&#xD;
clock. They had spoken but a few&#xD;
words, and those far from the subject&#xD;
that was pressing on their hearts;&#xD;
presently he rose, and said, "I must&#xD;
go, Ina."&#xD;
But she threw her arms around him&#xD;
in an agony of grief ; she clung to&#xD;
him, she spoke in broken sobs. "0,&#xD;
tell me that you love me ! tell me&#xD;
that you will love me always ! that&#xD;
you, will come again ! soon ! soon !&#xD;
Ah, I cannot bear it t Tell me once&#xD;
more that you love me."&#xD;
He was frightened at the terrible&#xD;
state of agitation which she was in.&#xD;
He had never seen Ina before give way&#xD;
so entirely to her feelings; she gasped&#xD;
as though she could not get her breath.&#xD;
He said to   her sternly, "Ina,&#xD;
are you not a woman? are you a&#xD;
child?"&#xD;
In a moment more she drew her-&#xD;
self up and stood facing him perfectly&#xD;
quiet ; she was very pale, but her&#xD;
face was as still as if no emotion had&#xD;
just passed over it.&#xD;
%" Now go," she said ; "but give me&#xD;
one more kiss."&#xD;
He kissed her lips, and hurried&#xD;
away.&#xD;
And Ina and Sofi were alone to-&#xD;
gether with Sardo in the little home,&#xD;
once so dear,'2once so full, now life-&#xD;
less and empty. Ina would' wander&#xD;
&#xD;
around like a shadow  sometimes she&#xD;
would touch the furniture to see if_ it&#xD;
were real, if all had not been a dream;&#xD;
she was so lonely, her heart ached&#xD;
with a dull pain. Sofi tried to cheer&#xD;
her up, and she was always a comfort&#xD;
to Ina.&#xD;
"Now don't fret so," she would say;&#xD;
"you will grow pale and ugly. I must&#xD;
keep you fresh as a flower for Mon-&#xD;
sieur Emanuele. Life is sad enough&#xD;
without borrowing trouble ; you know&#xD;
he loves you better than his life,,and&#xD;
that is enough to keep you cheerful."&#xD;
Ina looked up and smiled.&#xD;
"There 'now, you look like your'&#xD;
self again; why, even the heavens do&#xD;
not look pretty when the stars go out&#xD;
at night, and your face islike a star-.&#xD;
less sky when you do not smile. I&#xD;
would not like to have him see you&#xD;
now!"&#xD;
" 0, I am so alone!" said Ina.&#xD;
"You must think all thptime, not&#xD;
of that, but how soon he will come&#xD;
back to you, and then of the joy you&#xD;
will have together when there are&#xD;
three to sit amongst the roses."&#xD;
"Yes," said Ina, smiling the hap-&#xD;
piest smile that Sofi had seen on her&#xD;
face since he went, "that will be a&#xD;
happy time."&#xD;
Every evening Sofi, Ina, and Sardo&#xD;
went to the post-office ; it was their&#xD;
only walk. Sardo would carry home&#xD;
the paper, and if Ina got a letter there&#xD;
was a quiet light in her eyes ; if not,&#xD;
she would sit sadly, doing nothing,&#xD;
but looking dreamily at the clouds as&#xD;
they sailed by overhead, until the&#xD;
twilight deepened into night ; and&#xD;
then, when the evening came, she&#xD;
would wander after Sofi, and, sitting&#xD;
down by her side, ask her to cheer&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
her. Emanuele wrote.often; his let-&#xD;
ters were full of love, but short,-he&#xD;
never spoke of his return nor of Ina's&#xD;
coming to him. Ina's were pa ion-&#xD;
ate appeals to himrto come, an reca-&#xD;
pitulations of- her wretchedness in&#xD;
being. separated from him. So time&#xD;
dragged wearily on; it no more sped&#xD;
away on the roseate wings of love.&#xD;
The short warm summerhad brought a&#xD;
leafless cold autumn, and all Ina's&#xD;
comfort was Sofi and Sardo. Often she&#xD;
would fling her arms around him and&#xD;
say, "Sardo, you love him too, - do&#xD;
you not?' Yo wish he were here, you&#xD;
are lonely alsowithout him? Ah, Sar-&#xD;
do, I am not now the gay mistress&#xD;
you once ! had ; my heart is heavy as&#xD;
lead,. and I do not feel happy."&#xD;
Th1e dog would look up at her with&#xD;
great sad eyes, and whine as .if he&#xD;
were sorry for her.&#xD;
" Tell ne," said Ina, one day, -&#xD;
"tell me your story, Sofi. Monsieur&#xD;
told me that you would some day,&#xD;
and I am dull."-&#xD;
"I -do not think," said Sofi, "that&#xD;
Monsieur'knew a great deal about it ;&#xD;
for no one "knows all my troubles&#xD;
save myself.".&#xD;
"Did you have troubles too, Sofi ?&#xD;
You look like'a bright yellow butter-&#xD;
fly, untouched by the storm."&#xD;
" Ah, Madan , every heart knoweth.&#xD;
its own bitterness, the Book of Life.&#xD;
says that ;('mine tare terrible to hear.&#xD;
I don't like to thikk, Madam, my soul&#xD;
is not pure like yours; if I thought, I&#xD;
should go mad," she said, with a low&#xD;
wail like a child's in her voice. "I&#xD;
will tell you now what no human&#xD;
soul ever heard pass my lips ; but 'I&#xD;
Jove you, Madam, and I feel as if I&#xD;
were confessing my sins to the Ma-&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
it&#xD;
&#xD;
donna if I tell them to you. I was&#xD;
the daughter of a captain; he was&#xD;
English, and my mother was Irish.&#xD;
have a sister, Madam, who is not&#xD;
like me; she is educated and lectures&#xD;
in public, and writes for the papers,&#xD;
and married an Italian political exile.&#xD;
My father and mother gave me as&#xD;
good an education as they did to her,&#xD;
for my father was proud of me ; but&#xD;
somehow I could not .learn, so they&#xD;
sent me to my aunt in Manchester,&#xD;
and she was to take especial care of&#xD;
.my learning. But, Madam, they&#xD;
could not teach me to read or write!&#xD;
I was so anxious to learn, I used to&#xD;
go and kneel down and pray God to&#xD;
let me learn to read, and it would not&#xD;
come. I learn everything by- my&#xD;
eye. I listened to all the stories my&#xD;
aunt told me from the Bible. I&#xD;
caught an idea quicker than any of&#xD;
my cousins ; but when they brought&#xD;
me my book, I would sit dully gazing&#xD;
at it, and then I would get into a&#xD;
passion of anger, I would bite it, and,&#xD;
getting up, put it under my feet and&#xD;
trample upon, it with fury. This&#xD;
went on every day, - anger, remorse,&#xD;
and shame, and yet I could not study.&#xD;
The master used to say he had never&#xD;
known so bright a. child, and he&#xD;
could not account for it. Well, I&#xD;
was only just thirteen years old when&#xD;
an old m4 came to see my aunt;&#xD;
he noticed me a good deal, and used&#xD;
to draw me on his knees, and play&#xD;
with my golden curls. They said he&#xD;
was a Count, and that he had lost his&#xD;
property in all the troubles of Italy,&#xD;
and now he gave lectures, and taught&#xD;
for his living. I used to hear them&#xD;
talk of him. I did not like him much;&#xD;
he looked. old and ugly enough to&#xD;
&#xD;
me, but they said he was only forty-&#xD;
five. You know, Madam, that to a&#xD;
little girl like me he seemed old&#xD;
enough to be my grandfather. He&#xD;
asked me if I would like to be his&#xD;
wife. I did .not know .what that&#xD;
meant, but I said yes, if he would&#xD;
not make me study. A few days af-&#xD;
ter my aunt told me that Count Mario&#xD;
had asked me to be his wife ; that a&#xD;
baby as I was must be very proud,&#xD;
and that it would make my mamma&#xD;
and papa very happy; that he was&#xD;
going to take me back to them, for&#xD;
they were in America.. I cried a&#xD;
little, but said I should like to go to&#xD;
my mamma; and so he came that&#xD;
night, and he kissed me and put a&#xD;
gold chain around my neck, -it&#xD;
was so heavy it hurt me, - and there&#xD;
was a beautiful little watch, made by&#xD;
Dent of England, hanging to it, and&#xD;
there were my initials and his crest&#xD;
'all in brilliants that sparkled like the&#xD;
water when the sun is upon it ; and&#xD;
then they dressed me in white, and&#xD;
curled my hair around my head, and&#xD;
took me to the church, and I heard&#xD;
the people say 'What a sacrifice !'&#xD;
and one old woman cried when she&#xD;
looked at me. Well, I was married,&#xD;
and the Count carried me back to&#xD;
America. I could not love him, Mad-&#xD;
am, but he was kind enough to me.&#xD;
He did not get on very well in teach-&#xD;
ing, and so he opened a first-class&#xD;
boarding-house, and it was all my&#xD;
own. I used to feel such pride as I&#xD;
looked over the banisters, and saw&#xD;
the shining stair-rods, and I thought,&#xD;
All that I am mistress of ! but my&#xD;
heart sickened when I saw my hus-&#xD;
band. We got .on very well;Nyoung&#xD;
as I was, I seemed to know how to&#xD;
&#xD;
do everything, and I cooked, and I&#xD;
purchased all the meats, and I kept&#xD;
the house, and the people used to say&#xD;
that they had never known anything&#xD;
so remarkable. Then, before I was&#xD;
fourteen I was a mother, but somehow&#xD;
I did not love my child with that new&#xD;
feeling of bliss that people talk of.&#xD;
I played witly it like a doll. It was&#xD;
a sweet little thing ; some day. I will&#xD;
show you its likeness. Well, Madam,&#xD;
I had another little child ; that wts a&#xD;
boy, the dearest little fellow in the&#xD;
world, and the people said that they&#xD;
did not know which of the three was&#xD;
the mother when they looked at us ;&#xD;
and before I was twenty I had had&#xD;
six children, but I lost four, - three&#xD;
at their birth, and one lived a year,&#xD;
and he 's now, with a little lamb at&#xD;
his feet, in Greenwood Cemetery un-&#xD;
der the trees. Then my husband&#xD;
took a fancy to come back to his own&#xD;
country, and we sold everything and&#xD;
crossed the ocean again; we went to&#xD;
Naples -   Ah, Madam," said Sofi,&#xD;
covering her face, "there was where&#xD;
all my troubles began. I met at the&#xD;
hotel there a young officer, he knew&#xD;
the Count slightly ; well, we began&#xD;
to look at each other across the table,&#xD;
and then to speak, and then we&#xD;
walked together, and I had never&#xD;
known what love was. The Count&#xD;
had been good to me in New York, but&#xD;
now he began run after women of&#xD;
all kinds. I would not have minded&#xD;
if I had been old and ugly, but I was&#xD;
a joy for any man then, and I got so&#xD;
disgusted with him that it hurt me&#xD;
to look at him, so I thought always&#xD;
with a beating heart of my young&#xD;
officer. Ah, Madam, if you had seen&#xD;
him, -it was impossible not to love&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
him, and I was almostmad for love&#xD;
of him, and we decided to run away&#xD;
together. I thought it was no wrong,&#xD;
because I' gave up all, my position,&#xD;
my honor, all for love:"&#xD;
"And your children," said Ina,&#xD;
quickly, " what became of them? Ah,&#xD;
Sofi," she said sadly, "I thought you&#xD;
could do no wrong. How all my&#xD;
planks are slipping from me!"'-&#xD;
'"Madam, don't reproach me, or I&#xD;
shall go mad. I loved him, - you&#xD;
know what love is; it 's awful to&#xD;
feel your whole soul- going out of&#xD;
you ! And he loved me ! Ah," she&#xD;
said, standing .still and looking as if&#xD;
dreamily back, " I can say I have&#xD;
been loved once."&#xD;
Ina covered her face with her&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
"Why, Madam, when he went to&#xD;
the field to exercise his troops, he&#xD;
shouted out my name, instead of the&#xD;
orders', he sent his servant of the&#xD;
ordnance twenty times from the field&#xD;
to know if I were well, and what I.&#xD;
was, doing ; he would never eat his&#xD;
dinner unless I was on his knee, and&#xD;
he would not take a mouthful unless&#xD;
I tasted it first ; he would kiss my&#xD;
feet, and lie with them in his breast,&#xD;
and I would rush from   his arms&#xD;
madly crying out, My child, give&#xD;
me my child. Ah, it was terrible,&#xD;
when the first was past, - the first&#xD;
dream of passion ! Then I shrieked&#xD;
aloud for my child, I tore my hair;&#xD;
he fell at my feet, and I said he was&#xD;
a seducer, and I hurled him from me.&#xD;
MlVy husband, carried his complaints&#xD;
to the minister, and my young officer&#xD;
was disgraced. They stripped him&#xD;
of his epaulets, and still he loved&#xD;
me ! I ivent to the king,. and he&#xD;
&#xD;
listened to my story, and gave me a&#xD;
writing to carry to the minister ; the&#xD;
minister said the king had nothing&#xD;
to do with those things, nor had he&#xD;
any power to give back my officer's&#xD;
title ; then I flung myself at the&#xD;
minister's feet - 0 Madam, I lay&#xD;
there on the floor before him, and I&#xD;
told him life was short, that this life&#xD;
was not all, and at the last judgment&#xD;
he must answer for all the misery he&#xD;
gave. '0, give back his honor,' I&#xD;
cried; 'you will not repent of mal-&#xD;
ing two miserable creatures happy!',&#xD;
and he lifted me up and took pity on&#xD;
me, and said he would make him a&#xD;
temporary officer in the Volunteer&#xD;
Corps ; and then he joined the Gari-&#xD;
baldians, and he was shot at the head&#xD;
of his soldiers, and I nursed him day&#xD;
and night. I went into the hospitals,&#xD;
and took care of all those poor, suf-&#xD;
fering creatures,-God have mercy&#xD;
on them !-and I fled from him for&#xD;
my child; they had taken her to&#xD;
Rome, - it was always my little girl'&#xD;
I seemed so wild.for. And I went&#xD;
to the old Pope, and kneeled to him,&#xD;
and told him I was a mother, and he&#xD;
smiled ; and I weqt to Cardinal An-&#xD;
tonelli, and he saw my agony, and&#xD;
they gave me a sight of my darling,&#xD;
and I cried over her, and she said,&#xD;
'You are my mamma, whatever they&#xD;
tell of you;. they say I must not&#xD;
pray for you because you went away&#xD;
and left me.', And then they tore her&#xD;
from my arms, and I went back."&#xD;
" And your - your friend," said&#xD;
Ina, hesitating.&#xD;
" He ! 0 Madam," and Soft's face&#xD;
looked wild for a moment with pas-&#xD;
sion, "he married another, not for&#xD;
love, but for money. I had abanl-&#xD;
&#xD;
doned him, and he had no means ;&#xD;
his career was finished, for the Vol-&#xD;
unteers were sent home, - and I sold&#xD;
my little things that were left me,&#xD;
and I pawned my diamond ear-rings&#xD;
and pin, and my watch and chain,&#xD;
and I followed him to Naples. I got&#xD;
there late at night, and I knew his&#xD;
house: I saw the porter; he said that&#xD;
the gentleman had gone to the opera,&#xD;
that lie would return later.'&#xD;
"I said,,'Tell him that a lady must&#xD;
speak to him immediately, when he&#xD;
comes in, at - Hotel.' . I went to&#xD;
the hotel, and paced the floor, burn-&#xD;
ing with anxiety, till I heard his&#xD;
tread ; then he came in pale as death,&#xD;
and I sprang into his arms. I pushed&#xD;
him from me, and told him of all his&#xD;
false treachery. He said he loved me&#xD;
still, he wept, he implored me on his&#xD;
knees not to leave him again alone..&#xD;
I said no, that I had sins enough&#xD;
already on my soul, and that'I would&#xD;
not commit another crime. We cried&#xD;
together all night, and be prayed and&#xD;
entreated, and I said never, and at&#xD;
five o'clock the next morning I left&#xD;
Naples. alone."'&#xD;
"And this husband ?" said Ina.&#xD;
Ah, Madam, I married him to&#xD;
try to forget ; but somehow it all&#xD;
.comes back and haunts me ever. I&#xD;
used to feel mad with envy when I&#xD;
saw Monsieur Emanuele speaking so&#xD;
lovingly to you."&#xD;
"And your children ?" -said Ina.&#xD;
Sofi began to sob. Ina was sorry&#xD;
she had spoken so thoughtlessly of&#xD;
them.&#xD;
uI don't want to think of them ;&#xD;
they are well taken care of by my&#xD;
husband's rich relations. My little&#xD;
girl is beautiful, - I do not say it&#xD;
&#xD;
because she is my child, but they all&#xD;
say so,- people turn to look at 'her&#xD;
in the street ; in Italy golden hair is&#xD;
so much admired, and hers is in long&#xD;
curls down to her waist,pand they say&#xD;
a young prince has already spoken&#xD;
for her."&#xD;
" And why did you go out to ser-&#xD;
vice, Sof ? "&#xD;
" My husband was a poor man,&#xD;
and I was wihout-a cent; and now,&#xD;
Madam, I have put in your hands all&#xD;
my life."&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
NA   thought long that night over&#xD;
poor Sofi's story ; she felt regret&#xD;
that she knew that Sofi had fallen,&#xD;
and yet she felt a keener interest&#xD;
than ever in her little maid-of-all-&#xD;
work. "Ah, how sad life is ?" said&#xD;
Ina to herself, as she turned her&#xD;
head on the pillow; "and, as Sofi&#xD;
says, how terrible love is ! It seems&#xD;
inexorable as death in its laws. The&#xD;
Greeks had reason to believe in fa-&#xD;
tality ; it seems indeed tp be like an&#xD;
iron chain cutting into one's flesh,&#xD;
and that one cannot shake off. - Ah,&#xD;
poor little Sofi! you too have turned&#xD;
many a night restlessly oil your pil-&#xD;
low. Does the heart-ache, I wonder,&#xD;
ever cease ? Would it be possible to&#xD;
go on for years with this dull pain&#xD;
in one's soul? It is as if suddenly&#xD;
from the earth'had been taken away&#xD;
all its freshness, all its glad flowers,&#xD;
all its little birds, its rippling waters,&#xD;
and that one low wail filed its des-&#xD;
olati darkness. I had faith in Soft,&#xD;
now that is gone, -in the past I&#xD;
mean. I had comfort in feeling that&#xD;

&#xD;
she'was gay and untouched by sor-&#xD;
rows, and now I know her heart has&#xD;
been wrung. It is well perhaps to&#xD;
feel that all those we pass on the&#xD;
high-road of this earth, no matter&#xD;
how bright they look, have been&#xD;
through the deep waters of trouble;&#xD;
that would make the very brushing&#xD;
of their garments against ours sa-&#xD;
cred, and some sympathy would go&#xD;
out from us to them. Ah, Emanuele,&#xD;
if you loyed me as I do you, if you,&#xD;
were half as wretched as I am with-&#xD;
out you,' you could not leave me&#xD;
here alone. I cannot believe in the&#xD;
necessity of any false position. It&#xD;
seems to me /as if all ought to be&#xD;
clear as the daylight; but if I could&#xD;
once say fully, wholly, through what-&#xD;
ever losses, sorrows, or disappoint-&#xD;
ments, so that I 'might learn to&#xD;
come to our Father who is in&#xD;
Heaven, then his will, his will, not&#xD;
,mine, be donee but it is hard to&#xD;
say,. save with the lips ; those move,&#xD;
and the heart remains still. Some-&#xD;
times all things seem a mockery to&#xD;
me. I cannot bear nature to be so&#xD;
bright, whilst I feel so immeasurably&#xD;
sad !"&#xD;
Time went rolling slowly on in&#xD;
the little cottage. Sofi too often felt&#xD;
lonely, for although, as she had said,&#xD;
she had not taken this husband for&#xD;
love, yet she had a, certain sort of&#xD;
fondness for him, and she missed him&#xD;
-too. But Sofi'sfirst feeling was devo-&#xD;
tion to her mistress, and nothing on&#xD;
earth would have tempted her to for-&#xD;
sake her; besides, Sofi began to feel&#xD;
anxious and sorry for Ina herself; she&#xD;
wondered what! this mysterious, re-&#xD;
lation was that existed between Ina&#xD;
and Emanuele. Sofi's morals were not|&#xD;
&#xD;
very sound upon the subject of love&#xD;
-that, she thought, justified all&#xD;
things,-but any other deed that&#xD;
was not highland honorable was to&#xD;
her perfectly abhorrent.&#xD;
"I thought," said Sofi one day,&#xD;
"when I first came-here, that you&#xD;
and Monsieur Emanuele were lov-&#xD;
ers."&#xD;
"And so we were !" said Ina, with&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
"No, I did not mean just that,"&#xD;
said Sofi. "I meant that I thought&#xD;
you were just bound together for the&#xD;
time being, that - But when I cane&#xD;
to know you better, and saW you&#xD;
were just as innocent as, the angels&#xD;
in heaven, then I began to-not&#xD;
quite understand how it all was."&#xD;
"You thought that ! " said Ina,&#xD;
scarlet to her temples, and catching&#xD;
hold of Sofi's wrist; "you thought&#xD;
that of me ! How    could you love&#xD;
me? how could you live with me?"&#xD;
She went on, more excited every mo-&#xD;
ment ; but suddenly she let go Sofi's&#xD;
hand, caught her breath, and, turning&#xD;
deadly pale, said, "Think what you&#xD;
will of me, I care not:"&#xD;
"Why, Madam, if one robbed, or&#xD;
killed, or was cross and selfish, or&#xD;
proud, and unkind to the poor, - if&#xD;
a rich person goes around with un-&#xD;
charitable feelings in the heart, that&#xD;
is all a crime ; but love is a justifier&#xD;
of itself. One cannot do much wrong&#xD;
if one only loves. Does not the Book&#xD;
of Life say that Christ said, 'Because&#xD;
you have loved much, much shall be&#xD;
forgiven to you'? That is a proif-&#xD;
ise in itself."&#xD;
"Ah, Sofi, it does not niean that&#xD;
kind of love, but because the Mag-&#xD;
dalene had a rich nature, and gave&#xD;
&#xD;
from it fully to her God, after she&#xD;
had sinned."&#xD;
"Well, I don't, take it that way,&#xD;
Madam; but they do say in Italy&#xD;
dreadful things, and, they say that&#xD;
Christ loved -"&#xD;
"Hush!" saidIna, putting her hand&#xD;
over Sofi's mouth. " Italy is a place&#xD;
where there is little reverence, much&#xD;
corruption, and scarcely any faith&#xD;
amongst the men. What would you&#xD;
have? They have seen so much that&#xD;
was false, they'have sat behind the&#xD;
scenes and seen the puppet-strings&#xD;
pulled so often, that they laugh at&#xD;
the effects produced afterwards."&#xD;
"Yes; is it not awful, Madam ?&#xD;
and I think that the'men's disbelief,&#xD;
is better than the women's pretended&#xD;
devotion and bigotry. They just&#xD;
kneel there with their prayer-books&#xD;
in their hands, their lips repeating&#xD;
the prayer, and their. eyes wandering&#xD;
all around the church, to see the&#xD;
dresses of their neighbors, or to ex-&#xD;
change a glance with some of those&#xD;
dark-eyed, wicked men!"&#xD;
"That indeed seems true," said&#xD;
Ina, ",but we must not judge from&#xD;
appearances."&#xD;
"0, is n't it terrible, Madam, the&#xD;
way those Italian men have?  They&#xD;
just take you down, like a bird from&#xD;
a tree, without once firing. When I&#xD;
heard my officer under my window,&#xD;
with his divine song, I used to feel&#xD;
as if I must float down to him ; and&#xD;
those letters-ah;,Madam, they would&#xD;
have moved a heart of bronze !-so&#xD;
full of love and death. But I do not&#xD;
think they have much feeling ; it is&#xD;
only with them the ' winning, and&#xD;
then they throw us away like nettles&#xD;
that had stung them. He called me&#xD;
8&#xD;
&#xD;
Stella, that was his star, and anima&#xD;
mia, that was his soul."&#xD;
Ina groaned. That was the name&#xD;
that Emanuele had so often called&#xD;
her by, and that had 'so rung in her&#xD;
ears ; it seemed as if she heard him&#xD;
now; why did she not?'She could&#xD;
not bear it any longer.&#xD;
"Madam," said Sofi, with a bright&#xD;
fire flashing in her eyes, "if I thought&#xD;
any man would be so cruel, so abject,&#xD;
so base and treacherous as to deceive&#xD;
you, I would not live any longer. I&#xD;
am in a humble position,-I know it,&#xD;
-and he is a great gentleman; yet I&#xD;
would not think he was good enough&#xD;
to make a mat for my feet, that I&#xD;
might wipe them   on it. I would&#xD;
trample on his lQve, I would kill&#xD;
him," she said passionately ; and then&#xD;
she continued, "Don't you fret about&#xD;
him, they are not worth crying your&#xD;
pretty eyes about; and besides he&#xD;
loves you, and is good, we both know&#xD;
it ; only I meant, if any one sh-ould&#xD;
ever dare to think even of wronging&#xD;
you, that he would find a man in&#xD;
me; but don't you cry. Monsieur&#xD;
loves . you dearly, all his actions&#xD;
showed, it.; his eyes were so full of&#xD;
love when they looked at you."&#xD;
"I know it," said Ina, wiping her&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"And then he will come, and we&#xD;
will have a splendid boy, with just&#xD;
his eyes, to put in his- arms, and he&#xD;
will be proud, and you will be happy,&#xD;
and poor Sofi, too, not the least."&#xD;
"0 Sofi, you are so good to me,"&#xD;
said Ina, putting her arms around&#xD;
her neck ; " why do you not kiss me,&#xD;
Sofi? Sardo cannot, and -I often&#xD;
wonder you do not."&#xD;
"Because, Madam, I never feel&#xD;
&#xD;
INA..                                             3 3&#xD;

4 INA.                          35&#xD;
&#xD;
as if I were worthy to touch you.&#xD;
I would give my life for you, but I&#xD;
never dare touch you." -&#xD;
"Well, kiss me now, dear Sofi."&#xD;
Another day when they were sit-&#xD;
ting silently together, Sofi suddenly&#xD;
looked up and said3 "Do you know&#xD;
what is the last mode, Madam ?"&#xD;
" No," said Ina.&#xD;
"Death, Madam,-that is the last&#xD;
mode; those fine Italian ladies do&#xD;
not think of that when they play&#xD;
their pranks."&#xD;
Ina sighed heavily.&#xD;
"Do you know who is your best&#xD;
friend, Madam ?"&#xD;
"Emanuele," said Ina.&#xD;
"No; your pocket."&#xD;
" 0 Sofi, that does not sound like&#xD;
you, that rings with a hard, cold,&#xD;
metallic sound. I do not want you&#xD;
to say those things."&#xD;
"Well, Madam, -it is trpe; if you&#xD;
are rich, .it is power, you can com-&#xD;
mand the whole world, everybody is&#xD;
at your feet; but to-morrow if you are&#xD;
poor, and want a favor, there is not&#xD;
one will stir a hand for you; if you&#xD;
were rich, to-morrow you could start&#xD;
for Turin, and be with Monsieur&#xD;
Emanuele, and he would give you a&#xD;
warmer welcome too if you came in&#xD;
your own coach."&#xD;
"0, do not say so, Sofi; it is&#xD;
false."&#xD;
"I did not mean that he would&#xD;
love you any better, but somehow&#xD;
wealth is a great dazzle, and it buys&#xD;
a great deal of respect."'&#xD;
"It does not buy loe," said Ina,&#xD;
"and it does not buy admission to&#xD;
the other world." -    -&#xD;
"No, Madam; the 13ook of Life&#xD;
says that we brought nothing into&#xD;
&#xD;
this world, and{we can take nothing&#xD;
out; that is an awful thought, I&#xD;
often used to say to Victor Emanuel."&#xD;
Ina smiled.&#xD;
"Indeed, Madam, I have talked to&#xD;
him many a time, when we were in&#xD;
the Tyrolian Alps, with our soldiers;&#xD;
he is just as natural and easy as a&#xD;
man can be. Why, I was more afraid&#xD;
of Monsieur Emanuele than I ever&#xD;
was of his Majesty; he spoke to me&#xD;
in English, and I used to say to him,&#xD;
'How can you wear your gold sceptre&#xD;
and chain and crown, and fling away&#xD;
so much money ?' and he would an-&#xD;
swer, just in these words, 'My dear,&#xD;
I cannot put a loaf of bread in every-&#xD;
body's mouth,' and indeed he is gen-&#xD;
erous with his money. I said to him,&#xD;
one day, 'How can you lead such a&#xD;
wicked life ?' and he said it would&#xD;
be wicked to steal or rob, but that&#xD;
love was not wrong, and then he&#xD;
would touch me under the chin, and&#xD;
call me his beautiful blonde; but&#xD;
when I heard that, I said, 'Business&#xD;
first, your Majesty, and then love,'&#xD;
and I ran away to the sick soldiers.&#xD;
If you should ever go to his pal-&#xD;
ace and speak with him, tell him of&#xD;
the English blonde in the Tyrol, and&#xD;
he will tell you that he remembers&#xD;
me, I am sure."&#xD;
Ina had not had a letter for a&#xD;
week ; she had written every day,&#xD;
and was beginning to feel such dull&#xD;
despair as she knew not how to con-&#xD;
quer. Sometimes she would think&#xD;
that she would take the cars and go&#xD;
to him, that was the quickest. way,&#xD;
that was the only hope and help;&#xD;
then she would say to herself, hope-&#xD;
lessly, " But where shall .I go ? I&#xD;
dare not go to the Benonis, and be-&#xD;
&#xD;
sides," she remembered, with the&#xD;
cold drops starting on her brow,&#xD;
"they would turn me from the door&#xD;
if they saw me now ; and he -    0,&#xD;
if I should arrive at his room  and&#xD;
he should look angrily at me I&#xD;
should go mad !"   The days went&#xD;
on slowly, slowly dragged the heavy&#xD;
hours. " If I should not have a let-&#xD;
ter!" ever went whirring round like&#xD;
a wheel in her head, "if I should&#xD;
not hear !"  Thousands of times she&#xD;
had looked at her watch, and now&#xD;
she called Sofi with a voice in which&#xD;
there was no life, and said, " Come,&#xD;
Sofi, come, Sardo, let us go to the&#xD;
mail; it is time now !"&#xD;
"God bless your heart !" said Sofi ;&#xD;
"if I could write it with my blood,&#xD;
and make it come from him, I would&#xD;
do it."  ,&#xD;
They went to the- post-office, and&#xD;
to Sofi's inquiry there came a letter.&#xD;
0, how Ina's eyes were dimmed&#xD;
and her lips parched ! A letter for&#xD;
her! yes, it was there at last. She&#xD;
held it listlessly in her hand, there&#xD;
was no rebound ; she had suffered&#xD;
so for that, letter that her heart&#xD;
could not be'glad.&#xD;
"Are you not going to open it ?"&#xD;
said Sofi.&#xD;
"Yes," said Ina, "by and by."&#xD;
She waited until she arrived again&#xD;
at her little home, and then she went&#xD;
up to her room and shut the door,&#xD;
and opened her letter ; it ran thus:&#xD;
"Carissima Ina, - I have received&#xD;
all your little winged messengers,&#xD;
and have kissed them for your sake.&#xD;
My heart has been often with you&#xD;
in the little home, but you must par-&#xD;
don me, my love, if I did not write;&#xD;
mhy time has been so completely&#xD;
&#xD;
crowded with business that I have&#xD;
not had a moment that I could call&#xD;
my own. I have news to tell you&#xD;
that will flush your cheek with joy&#xD;
and pride, I know, for your friend.&#xD;
Day before yesterday the King gave&#xD;
a great dinner ; and he rose from his&#xD;
seat after dinner, and came to where&#xD;
I sat, and placed the broad green&#xD;
ribbon with the high decoration of&#xD;
officer on ittaround my shoulder. I&#xD;
said, 'I do not desire, your Majesty&#xD;
knows, these badges of your kingly&#xD;
favor.' The King laughed, and said,&#xD;
'I should like to see any man refuse&#xD;
an honor at my hands'; and that&#xD;
evening I was nominated by him&#xD;
prime minister, and yesterday the&#xD;
nomination was confirmed by the&#xD;
Chamber,- so you see, my Ina, that&#xD;
I am not in disgrace. I shall have&#xD;
less time to write you than ever;&#xD;
my star is in the horizon, I do not&#xD;
mean to let it descend, but the&#xD;
statesman forgets not the sweetest&#xD;
part of life, and therefore he bears as&#xD;
a talisman his Ina in his heart.&#xD;
Farewell, my love.          B."&#xD;
Emanuele never signed himself&#xD;
save with his last initial when writ-&#xD;
ing to Ina. She read and reread&#xD;
his letter, then she threw herself&#xD;
sobbing upon her knees ; there Sofi&#xD;
found her.&#xD;
"Why, what is the matter ?" said&#xD;
Sofi, running in fright to her.&#xD;
"0 'Sofi, the King has named&#xD;
him minister, is not that dreadful?"&#xD;
"Why," said Sofi, "is that what&#xD;
my 'heart is crying for ? -That is&#xD;
power, wealth, position,-- do you&#xD;
not see it ? Now all will be smootht&#xD;
waters; he will make you his wife."&#xD;
"What," said Ina, "again those&#xD;
&#xD;
0&#xD;
&#xD;
34    '   '                                     ' ' INA.&#xD;

INA.                          37&#xD;
&#xD;
words ! ",and she -sprang to her feet,&#xD;
her eyes darting quick flames, and&#xD;
then turned away her head and said,&#xD;
"Do not be frightened, little Sofi; I&#xD;
have such a fiery temper, I forgot&#xD;
myself!"&#xD;
" I meant," said Sofi, " then he will&#xD;
send for you, and all will be right,&#xD;
and you will be happy again.",&#xD;
SIna shook her head. " He did not&#xD;
say anything about it in his letter."&#xD;
" He did not have time to crowd&#xD;
in everything, but you will see that&#xD;
it will be so; now cheer up for an-&#xD;
other's sake.. Why, our boy will&#xD;
be a'very sad little. fellow, and we&#xD;
shall never have a good night's rest&#xD;
with him, if you do not take. things&#xD;
more quietly."&#xD;
Ina smiled, and said, "Well, Sofi,&#xD;
I will try to look on the. bright side&#xD;
for his sake, but it is hard some-&#xD;
times ! But if I feel very ill I will&#xD;
send for him; do - you think he.&#xD;
would come?"&#xD;
" Of course he would," said Sofi,&#xD;
not daring to discourage her mistress.&#xD;
The days at last will go by, weary&#xD;
and long as they seem at the begin-&#xD;
ning ; and autumn had set into win-&#xD;
ter, and the Alps looked dull and&#xD;
dreary enough. Ina felt as if they&#xD;
lay all day on.her heart, and that she&#xD;
should never breathe freely until she&#xD;
was on the other side of them, they&#xD;
threw such great shadows on the&#xD;
plains, and seemed, now the sun did&#xD;
not shine, to wrap all the earth in&#xD;
darkness.&#xD;
" I feel very ill," said  a, looking&#xD;
up plaintively into Soft's face ; " do&#xD;
you think I might write and say so?"&#xD;
" Certainly," said Soft, and Ina&#xD;
wrote:-         .-&#xD;
&#xD;
"0 my beloved, what can I say to&#xD;
you that I have not said ? I stretch&#xD;
out my arms to you, and the shadow&#xD;
of your greatness mocks them; my&#xD;
soul is so weary, my heart so dull,&#xD;
myself so changed, that perhaps you&#xD;
would not love me as you used. 0&#xD;
Emanuele, I only long to see you; I&#xD;
am ill, I fear my hour has come, and&#xD;
you are not near me. 0 my husband,"&#xD;
-  that wor   was erased, and care-&#xD;
fully scratel d out, and "lover " sub-&#xD;
stituted, - "0  my lover of former&#xD;
days, come ; ever my soul repeats&#xD;
that dreary lay. Farewell. All yours&#xD;
unto death. Ina."&#xD;
And that night Ina came like a&#xD;
spectre, in her long white dressing.&#xD;
gown, to Sofi's bedside, and called'&#xD;
her to come to h'er. They were all&#xD;
alone, these two women, and yet Sofi&#xD;
never shrank from any act where&#xD;
energy and courage were to be dis-&#xD;
played ; she slipped on her clothes&#xD;
and said to Ina, "You go to bed, I&#xD;
will not be gone a moment."&#xD;
"0, do not leave me alone, Sofi; I&#xD;
shall die."&#xD;
"I must go for the doctor, dearest,&#xD;
and you must be calm."&#xD;
Sofi had a wonderful power over&#xD;
Ina, and she let herself be guided by&#xD;
her in all things ; it was just ten&#xD;
minutes that Sofi was gone, but to&#xD;
Ina it seemed hours,' and she returned&#xD;
with the physician.&#xD;
That night Soft telegraphed to Tu-&#xD;
rin : " All well, -- the'little boy and&#xD;
his mother."&#xD;
She hated Emanuele Bertani now,&#xD;
and only did it for Ina's sake.&#xD;
Ina, lay whiter than the sheets&#xD;
around her, and sleeping by her side&#xD;
was a little boy, with dark eyes, that&#xD;
&#xD;
he had opened long enough for Soft&#xD;
to discover their color. Ina was&#xD;
told she must rest, but she could not.&#xD;
She lay wondering what' she should&#xD;
call the little stranger; deeply as £he&#xD;
loved her husband, she had suffered&#xD;
so much of late that his name seemed&#xD;
to her to have something fatal in it.&#xD;
She wondered if he whom she loved so&#xD;
much, the father of her darling, would&#xD;
love him too, when they should live&#xD;
all together. Somehow her heart felt'&#xD;
less like marble since the little child&#xD;
was actually there, a palpable thing,&#xD;
by her side ; it seemed to her as if it&#xD;
drew her nearer to Emanuele, as if&#xD;
now the secret must cease to be, and&#xD;
he would come and take her to a&#xD;
new home, his wife before all the&#xD;
world; then the clouds would roll&#xD;
back and all her heaven was bright,&#xD;
and her little cherub looking down&#xD;
from it all dimples and smiles.&#xD;
Sofi," she said, " are you there ? "&#xD;
"No," said Sofi; "you must not&#xD;
talk."&#xD;
"But you are there," said Ina,&#xD;
laughing. Ah, how pleasant it sound-&#xD;
ed to Sofi's ear ! it almost frightened&#xD;
her for a moment ; it was so long&#xD;
since she had heard Ina laugh, she&#xD;
thought she was wandering in her&#xD;
mind. She went up ' to the bed,&#xD;
and bent anxiously over her lady, and&#xD;
stroked back her hair, to see if she&#xD;
had any fever. Inalooked up brightly&#xD;
in her face, and said: " Sofi, I feel&#xD;
better than I have in months.&#xD;
think I shall be happy now ; he will&#xD;
come."&#xD;
And she closed her eyes and slept.&#xD;
A telegram" arrived, and it said,&#xD;
"I greet the young mother ; keep me&#xD;
informed of all things. B." -&#xD;
&#xD;
Two days more and a letter came;&#xD;
it said : " My beloved Ina, God bless&#xD;
you! They have sent me word that&#xD;
you are a mother ; the electric chords&#xD;
have played upon my heart, and told&#xD;
me many sweet things. Take care of&#xD;
yourself, there are three now bound&#xD;
in one life ; this is the. only Trinity.&#xD;
When you are well enough you will&#xD;
come to Turin ; I must clasp you to&#xD;
me, I must kiss the hem of the young&#xD;
mother's garments, I must whisper in&#xD;
her ear a thousand things that she&#xD;
has already heard, but she will blush&#xD;
as of old at the low tones of her lover.&#xD;
I cannot come ; would that I could'&#xD;
cast Italy behind me, and free myself&#xD;
from the incubus of work ! but a cap-&#xD;
tain, however unworthy, yet must be&#xD;
where his ship is, guiding and guard-&#xD;
ing her from the shoals of disaster.&#xD;
To-day we have three different sedu-&#xD;
tos, so you must pardon my haste. I&#xD;
must satisfy them all, the - king, the&#xD;
ministry, the chambers, and the peo-&#xD;
ple, -0 herculean labor ! Farewell,&#xD;
sweet Ina."&#xD;
There was no initial, no signature&#xD;
at all; Ina missed it, but she was hap-&#xD;
py again, she should see him soon,&#xD;
for the first time his letter spoke of&#xD;
it since he left; he had told her to&#xD;
come, and in that strengthening hope&#xD;
she should get well; and she pressed&#xD;
her baby's tiny hands to her cheek,&#xD;
and she looked lovingly into its dim-&#xD;
ples, and he seemed the image to her&#xD;
of her husband. The doctor had said&#xD;
that Ina must not nurse her child,&#xD;
and vith great sorrow she was obliged&#xD;
to give up .this cherished desire. Soft&#xD;
said she would not have another wo-&#xD;
man in the house, for she knew that&#xD;
Monsieur Emanuele would not much&#xD;
&#xD;
36                        INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC8231-00000021"/>&#xD;
38                        INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
relish that idea, although she did not&#xD;
tell Ina so; but she determined her-&#xD;
self to bring it up by hand, and she&#xD;
and Ina talked over all things togeth-&#xD;
er, and at last they decided that Sofi&#xD;
should send for her husband, that he&#xD;
should help her to do all the work, -&#xD;
Sofi had often told her how he could&#xD;
'cook, and wash Sardo, and dust, -~and&#xD;
then she would take sole care of her&#xD;
mistress and the baby. She sent for&#xD;
him to come, and they were expect-&#xD;
ing him every day. Ina could not&#xD;
'write now to Emanuele, but his let-&#xD;
ters were more frequent than before,&#xD;
and he always spoke of seeing Ina&#xD;
soon, and this kept up her courage ;&#xD;
and then there was the baby to do&#xD;
for; he required constant attendance,&#xD;
his cries had to be stilled, he was&#xD;
something to love, to caress, to live&#xD;
for, and Ina's life was fuller now.&#xD;
She hung over her baby with such a&#xD;
look in her face often, that Sofi said&#xD;
she looked more like the Madonna&#xD;
than ever before.&#xD;
"0 my baby," she would say, "you&#xD;
have come like a rainbow with colors&#xD;
of hope and promise. I will call him&#xD;
Theodore, Sofi, gift of God; will not&#xD;
that be a pretty name? Once Eman-&#xD;
uele said he should have his name&#xD;
with Victor before it, then it would&#xD;
be for him and for the King ; but my&#xD;
baby shall never be called by the&#xD;
King's name, not even to please my&#xD;
beloved husband ; 'anything else I&#xD;
will do for him"; and then she took&#xD;
him in her arms and covered him&#xD;
with kisses.&#xD;
"0 Sofi, will not his father be&#xD;
proudj of him ? will it not be a blessed&#xD;
mome t when I place him in his&#xD;
arms ?"'&#xD;
&#xD;
One day as she lay on her sofa,&#xD;
which had been wheeled up to the&#xD;
window, Sofi had just brought in the&#xD;
.mail; there was no letter from her&#xD;
husband. Ina turned away with dis-&#xD;
appointment and opened the paper&#xD;
in hopes at least of seeing some men-&#xD;
tion of his name there, when sud-&#xD;
denly Sofi heard her utter a low cry&#xD;
of pleasure.                ,&#xD;
"What is it, Madam? Has Signor&#xD;
Emanuele got some new honors ?".&#xD;
0 no, Sofi, better than that," and&#xD;
the tears rushed into her eyes, and&#xD;
she stooped down and kissed the&#xD;
place on the paper where she was&#xD;
reading; "but my Princess has a&#xD;
little son too. 0, how often have I&#xD;
thought of her since I first pressed&#xD;
my darling to my heart ! how many&#xD;
times have I wondered if she had any&#xD;
such sweet hopes ! It was but yes-&#xD;
terday that the little Prince was born,&#xD;
ushered into the world with bells&#xD;
ringing and cannons sounding, and&#xD;
the people, it says, made an arch of&#xD;
roses under which the little prince&#xD;
was to be carried to the chapel of&#xD;
the Princess for its baptism, and it&#xD;
was written in flowers, 'Welcome our&#xD;
Prince!' 0 yes, he is loved for her&#xD;
sake !. I have ne er taken off my&#xD;
bracelet since s e first gave it me.&#xD;
Sweet Princess, how I wish I could&#xD;
come and give one kiss to you, and&#xD;
one to your little boy ! she would be&#xD;
glad, Sofi, if she knew that I was hap-&#xD;
py too. . How strange it all is; I feel&#xD;
as if I could see her in her room,&#xD;
lying amongst her lace sheets on her&#xD;
grand bed, with a crown carved over&#xD;
it, a gentle smile of peace on her face.&#xD;
-I am afraid they have taken away&#xD;
the child, that the etiquette of the&#xD;
&#xD;
court will not allow it to lie there&#xD;
and comfort her eyes ; but no matter,&#xD;
she is a mother. I wonder if in all&#xD;
the excitement she has ever thought&#xD;
of her little German friend. I did of&#xD;
her; that was strange, but when.you&#xD;
said it was a boy I thought of the&#xD;
Princess. I will send a kiss through&#xD;
the air, and she will feel it, and it&#xD;
will tell her all."&#xD;
The next day Ina had a letter from&#xD;
her husband; it said: "Ina, mia bella,&#xD;
when will you come to me ? are you&#xD;
not strong enough already?  I think&#xD;
it is time to give up the little house&#xD;
in the Alps, you will become a snow-&#xD;
bird else. The baby you will leave&#xD;
with Sofi; she will take admirable-&#xD;
care of him, so that your mother's&#xD;
heart will feel no anxiety ; she will&#xD;
be to him as good as you could be,&#xD;
for she is all fidelity and affection. I&#xD;
have spoken to the B       's, they&#xD;
would be only too glad to have y'ou&#xD;
back again; they have written you&#xD;
twice to know -if you could return,&#xD;
and are surprised that you have igt&#xD;
answered them. I told them that&#xD;
your brother had taken up all your&#xD;
time, but that now he was better.&#xD;
When will you come ? My expenses&#xD;
are very heavy, there are great de-&#xD;
mands upon me in -my present posi-&#xD;
tion, and I think it would be better&#xD;
if therefore you put Sofi to board in&#xD;
some simple house for the present at&#xD;
Lucerne, where we can go to her&#xD;
in the summer months : you must&#xD;
choose a pleasant place with a beau-&#xD;
tiful view. I long to see the boy,&#xD;
but as yet have no breathing time.&#xD;
.Write me that you will come soon. I&#xD;
will meet you at the station at any&#xD;
time you write, but come you must.&#xD;
&#xD;
I cannot do longer without my be-&#xD;
loved. Yours as ever."&#xD;
Ina held the letter convulsively&#xD;
cramped 'in her hand. Had it come to&#xD;
this? was this the end of the bright&#xD;
vista that had opened to her? She&#xD;
could not even weep. What !no home,&#xD;
-nor here, nor there. She could&#xD;
not believe even her eyes, -she re-&#xD;
read his letter, and then she sat down&#xD;
alone in her misery. What did it all&#xD;
mean ? Other ministers had wives ;&#xD;
why did Emanuele ,so shrink from&#xD;
showing hid ? Surely he was not&#xD;
ashamed of her ! and the blood&#xD;
rushed to her face.&#xD;
Did he not love her ? No, that was&#xD;
impossible, and she wiped away the&#xD;
scalding tears that fell. Every word,&#xD;
tone, look, had been that of passion-&#xD;
ate love.  Was he poor? had he&#xD;
fouhd himself embarrassed by debts&#xD;
before his marriage ? Ah, she was&#xD;
willing to work, to toil for him,-&#xD;
glad and proud to do it; but let it be&#xD;
openly done, not as a work of shame.&#xD;
Was there another, not loved now&#xD;
but once long before, to whom he&#xD;
held himself in honor bound? and&#xD;
Ina's heart almost ceased to beat at&#xD;
the mere thought of such misery.&#xD;
What was it that should tempt&#xD;
Emanuele to let her go back under a&#xD;
feigned name, in a false position, to her&#xD;
former life? He had so often said,&#xD;
too, that when she was his wife she&#xD;
should not ever again earn her own&#xD;
bread ; all should be from, 'him to&#xD;
her ! and Ina's mind kept recalling&#xD;
every most trifling 'ford that, had&#xD;
ever passed between them, every&#xD;
mninutest action of his ; still she&#xD;
could find no explanation of his con-&#xD;
duct. "I love him," she said in her&#xD;
&#xD;

is all I have in life to lean upon ;&#xD;
have no mother to tenderly care fTo&#xD;
me, no father to protect me; to ml&#xD;
brother I cannot 'go; my little boy&#xD;
must shield and protect, he canno&#xD;
do yet for me; I must be strong&#xD;
alone, and yet I feel so weak, so in&#xD;
competent to battle with the world&#xD;
If Emanuele were another, I couhl&#xD;
move him by my entreaties    he i&#xD;
tender, loving, true, but there i&#xD;
something terrible about him when&#xD;
he is determined. I dare not their&#xD;
rouse the lion that is in him; it i"&#xD;
not that I am afraid of him, but I&#xD;
fear to lose his love, - and why&#xD;
should I fear to lose any love, save&#xD;
through a fault of my own? 0 God,&#xD;
give me, that strength, that I may&#xD;
seek only to do right myself to others.&#xD;
We must each learn to walk alone;&#xD;
that is what I never have been able&#xD;
to do, and perhaps this ,trial is sent&#xD;
me, just to teach me this lesson of&#xD;
strength. Ah, Emanuele, Emanuele !&#xD;
it is not well to give so much pain.&#xD;
Do you know how your Ina's heart&#xD;
is bleeding?  Yes, I will go to him.&#xD;
I will put it all fearlessly before his&#xD;
eyes, for the sake now of another life&#xD;
that is more than mine, and he will&#xD;
take 'me in his arms, close to him,&#xD;
and all will be forgiven, all forgot-&#xD;
ten."&#xD;
Ina felt a natural pride that not&#xD;
Sofi nor any one on earth should&#xD;
know' she had one doubt of him ;&#xD;
she could accuse him in her inmost&#xD;
soul of thoughtlessness, nothing&#xD;
much worse, but she would not let&#xD;
Sofi know that there was one ripple&#xD;
on her waters. Sofl should not say&#xD;
one harsh word of him, think one&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
TNA     was growing stronger, and&#xD;
islh    knew  the time was near&#xD;
when she must break to Sofi her&#xD;
plans for the future. Go to him she&#xD;
would, at all hazards, and yet there&#xD;
was her baby lying in her arms,&#xD;
unconscious of all the storms in the&#xD;
heart of her who bent over him with&#xD;
so much love; 'her baby, one little&#xD;
pure drop of the tempest that was&#xD;
sweeping over her, how could she&#xD;
leave him.? She was beginning to&#xD;
feel a nightmare uncertainty creep&#xD;
into her life ; it seemed an inextrica-&#xD;
ble labyrinth in which she was going&#xD;
to lose herself ; how should she ever&#xD;
get out of it ?, and she thought of&#xD;
the story, which haunted her as a&#xD;
young girl, of the walls which grad-&#xD;
ually, slowly, but surely, closed in on&#xD;
one until they crushed out 'the life&#xD;
that was beating in the heartL How&#xD;
should she ever get back to her baby&#xD;
if once she left him ? how ever break&#xD;
away from her new place if once&#xD;
she went voluntarily and accepted&#xD;
&#xD;
it? She felt a strange superstition,&#xD;
too, in leaving the little cottage of&#xD;
her newly wedded love empty. If&#xD;
she could have always thought of&#xD;
Soi and her baby there, she should&#xD;
have seen them ever just as she left&#xD;
then,; but in a new place, a house&#xD;
which was not a home, where there&#xD;
were no associations, no memories,&#xD;
it seemed as if she were cutting&#xD;
loose from everything in the world.&#xD;
If she could have fallen on Sofi's&#xD;
neck, and cried out on her faithful&#xD;
breast all her troubles, it would have&#xD;
been a relief ; but she must bear this&#xD;
heavy load all alone. ".Alone," she&#xD;
said, " alone we come into this&#xD;
world, alone we must leave it, and&#xD;
we must suffer alone ; no one can&#xD;
ever bear our burden for us, it is the&#xD;
inevitable lot to walk alone ; even&#xD;
amongst crowds of admiring and lov-&#xD;
ing friends, the heart sits alone, afar&#xD;
from all, counting over its sorrows,&#xD;
as the weary fingers of some desolate&#xD;
monk pass silently over the beads&#xD;
of his rosary."&#xD;
"0   Madam," said Sofi, " is he&#xD;
not lovely ? He begins to smile, and&#xD;
it looks just like the water when&#xD;
you throw a tiny flower into it, and&#xD;
it' makes a thousand little waves, -&#xD;
for he seems to be laughing all over.&#xD;
Alh, it is always the Book of Life that&#xD;
speaks the truth, and te  one every-&#xD;
thing ! it says that a  oman forget-&#xD;
teth her sorrow and rejoices only&#xD;
because unto her a male child is&#xD;
born,   d- so it is.  Come and see&#xD;
him, M  dam, it will do your heart&#xD;
good ; make a picture of yourself in&#xD;
lhis eye, and see how. sweet it looks.&#xD;
I wish Monsieur Emanuele could see&#xD;
hi now"&#xD;
&#xD;
This was a good time, Ina thought,&#xD;
to begin; soshe said: "Sofi, I think&#xD;
it would be best to think now some-&#xD;
what of giving up the little home,&#xD;
now that your husband is here ; he&#xD;
will be a great help to us. I remem-&#xD;
ber Monsieur Emanuele said that he&#xD;
took it by the month, so we shall 'be&#xD;
free at the end of January. Do you&#xD;
not think," she said appealingly, for-&#xD;
getting her projects of independence,&#xD;
and falling back on her natural habit&#xD;
of leaning on Sofi, - do you not&#xD;
think it would be a good plan?"&#xD;
" I think," said Sofi, " it would be&#xD;
the best plan in the world. So,"&#xD;
she said, talking to the baby caress-&#xD;
ingly, and almost smothering it with&#xD;
her face, " we will shut up the&#xD;
little love - cottage, and some day,&#xD;
when you are a man, we will come&#xD;
here, and I shall be leaning on your&#xD;
arm, and you will say, 'Sofi, tell me&#xD;
just where you used to live with my&#xD;
beloved mother and father,'.and I&#xD;
shall say, 'Here, dear, in this nest&#xD;
among the roses, and your mother&#xD;
was the sweetest rose of all.'"&#xD;
Ina looked sadly at her; she had&#xD;
not the courage to speak, she was&#xD;
afraid she should choke, so she sat&#xD;
silent again.&#xD;
" Well, Madam," said Sofi, present-&#xD;
ly, " I think it will be pleasant to,-be&#xD;
again in -the city. I often used to&#xD;
think at night, suppose an ava-&#xD;
lanche were to slide down and cover&#xD;
us up, and that Monsieur Emanuele&#xD;
were to come to find us, and should&#xD;
see the snow in a great mound like&#xD;
a marble vault, and our tomb would&#xD;
be inside ! and it used to make me&#xD;
shiver ; it was lonesome here, al-&#xD;
though I never would say it to you&#xD;

&#xD;
before, but I shall be so glad to loo]&#xD;
out of the windows, and see the street&#xD;
lighted with gas. I was afraid i&#xD;
would make the baby gloomy ti&#xD;
show him always the stars."&#xD;
"But, Sofi, suppose I did not tak&#xD;
you with me."&#xD;
"Ah, I am not afraid that you&#xD;
would abandon me, Maam; you&#xD;
wsnt to try me as God did Abra&#xD;
ham."&#xD;
"No; but, Sofi, if I should leav&#xD;
my little Isaac here," said Ina, try-&#xD;
ing to smile, and feeling a strange&#xD;
choking sensation in her throat. "I&#xD;
almost have thought lately that it&#xD;
would be best for me to go first, to&#xD;
look up here some boarding-place in&#xD;
the mean' time for you and baby,&#xD;
and'- and," she said, hesitating,&#xD;
"perhaps I might go in the mean&#xD;
time to the ,Benonis, and take my&#xD;
former place, and from there see&#xD;
what I could find in the way of an&#xD;
apartment for us all." She had said&#xD;
the worst now, and she felt relieved&#xD;
that it was told ; but she was not pre-&#xD;
pared for Sofi's manner of taking it.&#xD;
Sofi's face was crimson, and her eyes&#xD;
were dancing with the rage that she&#xD;
knew not how to express.&#xD;
"Madam," she' said at last, "take&#xD;
that back!1 it' was not you that&#xD;
spoke, it never came from you! I&#xD;
know well who it was, it was Mon-&#xD;
sieur Emanuele. , He is an Italian,&#xD;
I always knew it, nothing better,&#xD;
with his winning, treacherous ways ;&#xD;
with those large dark eyes, that look&#xD;
all love, and are all deceit; with&#xD;
his low sweet voice that covers his&#xD;
anger just as a flower does- a snake ;&#xD;
with-"&#xD;
"Sofi!" said Ina, looking .at her&#xD;
&#xD;
k in blank astonishment, but Sofi did&#xD;
s not listen now.&#xD;
t   "With his fascinations, and his&#xD;
o eloquence," -she went on, "O, they&#xD;
would rob the soul of any woman!&#xD;
e We women only see the soft, bright&#xD;
feathers of the dart that is aimed at&#xD;
1 our poor hearts ; we only see the&#xD;
I smiling figure of Love ! we do not&#xD;
- stop to look behind, at the yinss&#xD;
that will fly away with it soon!&#xD;
Ah, Madam!" and she clenched her&#xD;
- hands and teeth, "if I could see him&#xD;
now, I would hurl his own baby in&#xD;
C his face !"&#xD;
" Sofi," said Ina, "are you mad?"&#xD;
" No, I am not," said Sofi; " I wish&#xD;
I were, I should like to bite him."&#xD;
" I cannot listen to you, Sofi, if&#xD;
you speak thus; you must leave me&#xD;
until you can calm yourself ; I am not&#xD;
now in a mood tp hear such words."&#xD;
Sofi went up to the bed, and,&#xD;
* placing the child gently amongst&#xD;
the pillows, left the room without&#xD;
speaking again; then Ina covered&#xD;
her face with her hands and wept&#xD;
bitterly.&#xD;
It was the first evening that Ina&#xD;
and Sofi had ever separated without&#xD;
sitting together and saying good&#xD;
night.-  Sofi would willingly have&#xD;
come into the room, but she felt that&#xD;
she had offended Ina too deeply.&#xD;
Ina's heart yearned *for Sofi, and she&#xD;
would have forgiven her even her&#xD;
anger against Emanuele, but she.felt&#xD;
that for his sake she ought to take&#xD;
all this project upon herself, and&#xD;
she wished that Sofi should feel that&#xD;
alL her indignation was due to her-&#xD;
self, and not to. him. So they both&#xD;
went to bed that~ night very misera-&#xD;
ble, and they neither of them slept&#xD;
&#xD;
at all. Early in the morning Ina&#xD;
heard some one crying at her door.&#xD;
" Come in, Sofi," she said gently.&#xD;
And Sofi cane in, and sobbed out :&#xD;
"0 Madam! I have been so miser-&#xD;
able, I have not closed my eyes. I&#xD;
wanted to come to you, and to my&#xD;
own precious little treasure, but' I&#xD;
dared not; I thought you might be&#xD;
asleep. I remembered what the great&#xD;
Book, says, that '"a soft answer turn-&#xD;
eth away wrath,' and I thought if I&#xD;
had spoken gently when I went out&#xD;
of the door, you would not have&#xD;
been angry ; but I could not then. I&#xD;
never saw you angry before," she&#xD;
said,, still crying like a child, "and&#xD;
it hurt me ; but I promise you, Mad-&#xD;
am, never again, so long as I live, to&#xD;
speak against any one you love, and&#xD;
you must promise me in return to&#xD;
forget that I ever did so."&#xD;
"iI will, I do," said Ina, crying too ;&#xD;
"and now, Sofi, let us forget the past,&#xD;
and come and sit down, and listen to&#xD;
my plans, and help me form them.&#xD;
I cannot, as you know, continue to&#xD;
stay here always alone. Monsieur&#xD;
Emanuele is so entirely occupied by&#xD;
his carder that he cannot come ; that&#xD;
is very natural; you know a minis-&#xD;
ter could not stay in Lucerne, it&#xD;
would be foolish even to expect it.&#xD;
He wants me to come to him, and I&#xD;
long with all my soul to see him,&#xD;
-Sofi, and," she said, hesitating and&#xD;
turning away her head so that Sofi&#xD;
should not see the blood that was&#xD;
rushing to her temples, "would it&#xD;
not be best for me to go myself, to&#xD;
take my place, for a short time, at&#xD;
Madam Benoni's, which is always&#xD;
open to me, and then I could be&#xD;
near him, and ready to send you&#xD;
&#xD;
word to come at any moment ; would.&#xD;
it not be best so, Sofi ? " she said in&#xD;
a low;pleading voice. "Do comfort&#xD;
me, Sofi; do encourage me, to take&#xD;
this step alone; you know I so lean&#xD;
on you, dear."&#xD;
Sofi was struggling with the indig-&#xD;
nation in her heart which was fer-&#xD;
menting there, all ready to break&#xD;
forth again ; but she remembered her&#xD;
promise so newly made, and she said:&#xD;
"Well, Madam, you must do what&#xD;
you think right. I would trust you&#xD;
in everything in life, and you know&#xD;
they do say,'nothing venture, nothing&#xD;
have.' Help yourself and God will&#xD;
help you, - that is what I always said&#xD;
to those lazy Italian poor, who used&#xD;
to come whining arom, not willing&#xD;
to do a thing for then elves; they&#xD;
seemed to think that they could just&#xD;
lie down and open their mouths, and&#xD;
something must drop into them."&#xD;
"But, Sofi," said Ina, with a quiv-&#xD;
ering lip, "how can I be separated&#xD;
from baby ? Ah, my heart is torn in&#xD;
two: whichever way I turn, I leave&#xD;
it rent behind me. What shall I&#xD;
do ?" she said helplessly. "I used&#xD;
to think I had some strength to act,&#xD;
but now I do not seem ever to know&#xD;
what to do. Help me, Sofi 1"&#xD;
"Yes," said Sofi, with sudden cour-&#xD;
age, "you shall go, that is best; when&#xD;
he sqes your sweet face, he will do&#xD;
anything you ask. So you go, dear-&#xD;
est, and I will see to baby as if I&#xD;
were his own mother ; and then you&#xD;
will be telegraphing me to come, and&#xD;
it will be better then not to have the&#xD;
house, because so we shall be freer&#xD;
to move, and that will be one chain&#xD;
broken that binds us here. You&#xD;
must look at the bright side of all&#xD;

things, Madam, and above all do not&#xD;
fret, so that he shall not. find you&#xD;
dull and changed ; there is nothing&#xD;
men hate so as to have women low-&#xD;
spirited, and even when you feel&#xD;
your heart is breaking, you must&#xD;
keep up .a smiling face before them,&#xD;
or they will fly off like the butter-&#xD;
flies to sun themselves in another&#xD;
flower : remember this, Madam, when&#xD;
Sofi is not there to tell you anything.",&#xD;
"I will nott forget it, Sofi, I will&#xD;
try to follow all jo  good advice ;&#xD;
but how shall I 4o about news from&#xD;
you? Ah, if you could only write !&#xD;
it seems as if that was too terrible,&#xD;
not to hear your voice at all, not&#xD;
even to hear you speaking to me&#xD;
through the silent paper."&#xD;
"My husband shall write to you&#xD;
every day, Madam, and we will tell&#xD;
you together about the little one, and&#xD;
all will be well; only keep up your&#xD;
spirits."&#xD;
("I will try, Sofi; I will do all I&#xD;
can."&#xD;
Sofi and Ina went out every day&#xD;
to try to find a comfortable situation&#xD;
for herself and the child. One place&#xD;
was too damp, another had no sun-&#xD;
light, anotheirwas too much exposed&#xD;
to the sharp alpine winds ; but at&#xD;
length Ina found a position that she&#xD;
thought would do. She- felt, even&#xD;
though leaving her baby with Sofi,&#xD;
as if she were making a little bark of&#xD;
bulrushes for it, and shoving it out&#xD;
on the stream of life all alone. ' Sofi&#xD;
was the sister that should watch her&#xD;
darling float from the shore. It was&#xD;
decided that in another fortnight&#xD;
they should part; .whenever she&#xD;
thought with a quick joy of the time&#xD;
when he would be near her again,&#xD;
&#xD;
then came a sharp pang of grief at&#xD;
the thought of what she left here,&#xD;
She felt she had a double duty, and&#xD;
she scarcely knew where it lay, her&#xD;
husband, her first love, in whom all&#xD;
her soul was wrapt; and the little new.&#xD;
born love, that lay unconscious of&#xD;
the struggles it had wakened in her&#xD;
heart. - One day as she sat sadly&#xD;
thinking of all these things, over and&#xD;
over revolving them in her mind,--&#xD;
she was looking dreamily into the fire&#xD;
before her, the baby was lying on her&#xD;
knee, one .little shoe lay on the floor,&#xD;
and its tiny rosy foot held in its&#xD;
mother's hand to keep it warm, --as&#xD;
they sat thus, Ina was startled-by a&#xD;
loud knock at the door. Her heart&#xD;
fluttered like a bird with sudden&#xD;
hope; she half rose hastily, and held&#xD;
by the chair to keep herself froh fall-&#xD;
ing ; it was the first time since she&#xD;
first entered the cottage that she&#xD;
had heard that sound, save when&#xD;
they were expecting the doctor, and&#xD;
he had long since ceased his visits,&#xD;
for Sofi and she had lived there in&#xD;
utter seclusion. Ah, if it should be&#xD;
he ! but no, that was too much hap-&#xD;
piness to look for, and the color&#xD;
that had mounted to her cheeks left&#xD;
them pale as the snow on the Alps;&#xD;
she had not the strength to take one&#xD;
step forwards, and she heard Sofi&#xD;
hurrying through the entry.&#xD;
A strong, clear voice, heard through&#xD;
the closed -door of the parlor, said in&#xD;
German, "Does Miss Strohling live&#xD;
here ? "&#xD;
"Who, sir?"&#xD;
"Miss Strdhling" was. the. an-&#xD;
swer, in cold, clear-cut tones. They&#xD;
knocked on Ina's heart like marble&#xD;
balls hurled at it. She did not stir,&#xD;

one hand was still holding for sup-&#xD;
port on to her chair, the other&#xD;
clasped her child half under her&#xD;
clap&#xD;
arm. "I wish to see her," the ,voice&#xD;
said authoritatively- "where is she?"'&#xD;
na heard Sofisay,-she knew the&#xD;
feigned courage in her tones, -" She&#xD;
is not well, sir, and does not see any&#xD;
one."&#xD;
"She will see me," said the hard,&#xD;
stern voice again, and Ina heard a&#xD;
heavy step approaching the door.&#xD;
where should she fly? -She looked&#xD;
wildly around, there was no room for&#xD;
escape ;she held her baby convul-&#xD;
sively close to her, and stood, her&#xD;
eyes flashing, facing steadfastly the&#xD;
door; she saw it open, and there he&#xD;
stood before her,-a strong-looking&#xD;
ma, with broad, square shoulders,&#xD;
with a quiet look of intense firm-&#xD;
ness about his face, light hair, clear,&#xD;
trustful, blue eyes, -he looked the&#xD;
very type of a true German. He&#xD;
came slo ly forward, and then, tak-&#xD;
ing a chair just opposite Ina, sat&#xD;
down, and, shading his eyes with his&#xD;
hand, said in a low voice, "Ina,&#xD;
speak !"  There was perfect silence&#xD;
in the room. Ina looked at the door,&#xD;
which was open still, aid in which&#xD;
Sofi stood with her' arms stretched,&#xD;
out, her eyes wide open, like an&#xD;
eagle ready to pounce ipon her prey.&#xD;
Ina made a slight motion with her&#xD;
hand for her to go,. and shut the&#xD;
door; she gave one more look, as&#xD;
if to say, "Are you perfectly safe&#xD;
alone ?"  Ina did not answer her&#xD;
look, but she made the same move-&#xD;
ment with her hand, this time with&#xD;
a slight gesture of impatience.&#xD;
Sofi disapeared, and closed the&#xD;
door after her ; they were alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ina, speak !" he repeated,' still&#xD;
without looking at her ; "have you&#xD;
nothing to say? why are you here?&#xD;
alone ? why have I not heard from&#xD;
you in so many months?"&#xD;
There was no answer; then in a&#xD;
hoarse voice,-he said, "Whose is that&#xD;
child?"&#xD;
"It is mine," said Ina, in a whis-&#xD;
per that was clearer than her own&#xD;
voice, and seemed to sound distinct-&#xD;
ly through the room, as if she had&#xD;
spoken aloud.&#xD;
" Whose name do you bear?" he&#xD;
said, suddenly uncovering his eyes,&#xD;
and looking at Ina.&#xD;
- "My own," she gid, now in her&#xD;
own voice, and meeting his look full&#xD;
in the eyes.&#xD;
"And mine?" he said, without&#xD;
moving a muscle of his ,face.&#xD;
"They are the same," she said,&#xD;
sadly.&#xD;
His head dropped as if, a flash of&#xD;
lightning had suddenly blasted him.&#xD;
Ina moved hastily towards him; she&#xD;
was frightened.&#xD;
"'My brother," she exclaimed, "for&#xD;
God's sake, look up!"&#xD;
He motioned for her not to ap-&#xD;
proach nearer to-him, but did not&#xD;
otherwise stir.- Ina rushed hastily&#xD;
to the door. "Sofi!" she screamed,&#xD;
and her voice .seemed to shriek, as&#xD;
if she no longer had any control over&#xD;
it. Sofi came running at her call.&#xD;
"Take my child," she said, wringing&#xD;
her hands, and not seeming to know&#xD;
what to do. "Give me some water,&#xD;
and then go, r and leave us alone ."&#xD;
*Sofi ran for the water, handdi&#xD;
to her, took the child, and went up&#xD;
stairs alone. She trusted na so en-&#xD;
tirely that she had no tough in,&#xD;

&#xD;
her own mind as to whether it was&#xD;
right to leave her so alone with a&#xD;
stranger ; she was only filled with&#xD;
a strange wonder and awe.   D&#xD;
Ina went back and stood near him,&#xD;
handing him the water, but not dar-&#xD;
ing to touch him.&#xD;
He spoke slowly, as.if every word&#xD;
he said hurt him, and with his head&#xD;
still down.&#xD;
"'You were an orphan, with their&#xD;
names who are in the grave to up-&#xD;
holdl, to revere, and to keep sacred;&#xD;
how have you held your holy trust?&#xD;
We were alone, and I had but you&#xD;
to love; where is the sweet thing I&#xD;
used to call by the name of sister?&#xD;
You are fallen so low that I dare not&#xD;
look at you ! Here are even the&#xD;
letters of those to whom I intrusted&#xD;
you; they believe that you are with&#xD;
your sick brother,-sick indeed at&#xD;
heart, even unto death, but with no&#xD;
need of one so false- to tend him.&#xD;
They-were not mine, it is true; I&#xD;
did not. open them until there came&#xD;
a despatch from them, and then,&#xD;
through fear of .some great mishap,&#xD;
I unsealed them. I went to Turin,&#xD;
and tracked you here, how, it mat-&#xD;
ters not to tell. I have found you,&#xD;
- would to God that I had lost you&#xD;
forever ! that you were lying in the&#xD;
dull earth, hidden from all the world !&#xD;
Would to God that you had died&#xD;
when they went, and I had been left&#xD;
alone ! I thanked him for you then,,&#xD;
little knowing that I should live to&#xD;
curse you !"  He paused, and then&#xD;
continued, " And' not one word, not&#xD;
one look of sorrow ! only defiance in&#xD;
your face met my eyes on entering&#xD;
the room. By what name shall I&#xD;
call you ? sister is hushed forever&#xD;
&#xD;
INA.                         47&#xD;
&#xD;
between us, Ina you are no longer&#xD;
and their name you cannot bear."&#xD;
"Wilhelm," said Ina, with such a&#xD;
sweet, low  accent that it - seemed&#xD;
as if he could not bear it, for he&#xD;
groaned, -"Wilhelm, brother at least&#xD;
of former days, I did not think to&#xD;
meet you thus; you have thrown&#xD;
scorn upon my head, and shame.&#xD;
You knew your Ina; she grew up&#xD;
with you, under your faithful care;&#xD;
could you think that I had forgotten&#xD;
all? could you throw me from you&#xD;
without one word from    my lips?&#xD;
have you no faith in purity and&#xD;
truth  and  innocence? could you&#xD;
not trust me against all the world?&#xD;
then your love was not a brother's.&#xD;
Wilhelm, I cannot let you.go from&#xD;
me so, it would kill me ! I do not&#xD;
know to whom I do most wrong. I&#xD;
am bound by a sacred promise to&#xD;
hold this secret ; but I think of our&#xD;
dead mother, I see her face between&#xD;
us, and I cannot let you leave me&#xD;
without one word of comfort. I am&#xD;
not the thing you hold me to be,-&#xD;
o God ! how could you wrong me&#xD;
so ? Iam 'a true and honorable wife.&#xD;
More than that you must not ask&#xD;
I can look into my child's eyes,-and&#xD;
pray for him to God, but to no one&#xD;
save you can I reveal at present&#xD;
what I have told you."&#xD;
" And you are willing to live thus,&#xD;
openly thought to be by the world&#xD;
what you are not ? to be held to be&#xD;
such a thing that women will gather&#xD;
in their skirts that they may not&#xD;
brush against you passing. and yo&#xD;
love the man who can subject youit&#xD;
such shame ? you honor him miore&#xD;
than your honor ? What cause ca&#xD;
teebe that he should not proudly&#xD;
&#xD;
claim you as his wife ? you - dare so&#xD;
wrong your parents' memory, your&#xD;
brother's name, your own womanly&#xD;
nature ! Ina," he laid, coming up to&#xD;
her, and looking at her with terrible&#xD;
anger in' his ,clear blue eyes, "tell&#xD;
me his name, that I may not be&#xD;
ashamed of my sister ; you shall bear&#xD;
it openly before the sun, and bright&#xD;
as that, or you will die dishonored."&#xD;
"Never," said Ina, "shall you hear&#xD;
it from my lips until he freely tells&#xD;
me that I may speak. I love him&#xD;
dearer than ife," drawing herself up&#xD;
before her brother, and throwing&#xD;
back her head proudly; "I love him,&#xD;
he is my   usband, and he will not&#xD;
wrong me !"' Then suddenly, as she&#xD;
looked at ira, his whole form so&#xD;
bowed down with trouble, a sense of&#xD;
pity came. over her' ftr him, she for-&#xD;
got his harsh severity towards her,&#xD;
and she said gently, "Wilhelm, doJ&#xD;
not despise me nor him; .it will notI&#xD;
be long, dea brother, before all will&#xD;
be right; trust me."&#xD;
But her  other's face had become&#xD;
deadly pale ; he turned slowly and&#xD;
said betwe n his teeth, "Ina, he I&#xD;
shall either right you or die like a,&#xD;
dog." He turned to go.&#xD;
Wilhelm," she said in an ago- t&#xD;
nized voice, and throwing herself be--&#xD;
fore him, "you know how timid I am, 1&#xD;
you think to terrify me into speak-1&#xD;
ing, you think I am the coward still&#xD;
that I used to be; take back those t&#xD;
words ! You. cannot frighten me,&#xD;
but you shall not go until you unsayc&#xD;
what you have said. 0, remember&#xD;
when Iwas but a child at 'your knee,t&#xD;
and you were sp tender of me ! and i&#xD;
I as left to your charge. Do not t&#xD;
break my heart ! I shall die," she t&#xD;
&#xD;
said in despair, growing hoarse as she&#xD;
spoke, and sinking into her chair&#xD;
wearied out by her passion, which&#xD;
had fallen on him as if he were of&#xD;
marble'; he did not speak one word,&#xD;
but moved-again toward the door.&#xD;
"Speak to me," she said, rising;&#xD;
"speak to me, Wilhelm."&#xD;
"I have spoken," he said, and he&#xD;
left the room. Ina heard the door&#xD;
close after him, then the entry door,&#xD;
and she could not move; she At as&#xD;
if her limbs were made of stone.&#xD;
Sofi hurried down stairs the instant&#xD;
she heard the door shut.&#xD;
"0 Sofi," saidIna, "are you come?"&#xD;
and she threw her arms around her&#xD;
neck and burst into tears; this was a&#xD;
relief to her. "It was my brother,&#xD;
Sofi; and he said, if all was not&#xD;
right, he would kill him."&#xD;
"Don't you mind," said Sofi, sooth-&#xD;
ing her as if she were a child. "0,&#xD;
how  I hate these men! I wish we&#xD;
could .go where we never again should&#xD;
see one of their detested faces. Don't&#xD;
you see he only said it to frighten&#xD;
you ? he does not know Monsieur&#xD;
Emanuele, and besides all will be&#xD;
right; in a few days you will be with&#xD;
him, and he will not refuse you any-&#xD;
thing, -he cannot ! You know one&#xD;
word, when you are there, will be"&#xD;
better than thousands written to&#xD;
him. I dreaded so your goig and&#xD;
now I shall be almost glad when the&#xD;
tume comes ! They see you are alone,&#xD;
and they take advantage, like "brutes,&#xD;
of your weakness ; but you must not&#xD;
give them  the victory by showing&#xD;
hem that you are afraid. Just hold&#xD;
up your head, and look them all in&#xD;

hemselves ; that is the way, not to&#xD;

INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
be cast down by any man; we can&#xD;
live without them all!".&#xD;
"0 Sofh," said Ina, "you always&#xD;
comfort me. What is it that makes&#xD;
mne lean on such a fragile little crea-&#xD;
ture for strength ? I do not know&#xD;
what I should have done without&#xD;
you, I do -not think I could have&#xD;
bore my troubles without you ; you&#xD;
ha e-been everything to me; how&#xD;
can I ever repay you ?"&#xD;
"1ie only thing I desire is to see&#xD;
you with the sweet, smiling face I&#xD;
used to see, to ,see you happy again,&#xD;
and then, I often think when I go to&#xD;
bed, at night, I should not mind&#xD;
dying."&#xD;
Ina was glad now to leave the little&#xD;
house, for she felt as if a shadow lay&#xD;
on it; both she and Sofi would feel&#xD;
{etter now to go away, for there she&#xD;
seemed always to see her brother be-&#xD;
fore her eyes, just as he looked when&#xD;
he said those terrible words ! She&#xD;
breathed freer whenever she was in&#xD;
the open air, anywhere away from&#xD;
the cottage which she, once loved so&#xD;
much. The day at last came when&#xD;
she was to say a final farewell to the&#xD;
early home of her love; she and Sofi,&#xD;
with Sofi's husband and the baby, all&#xD;
went together. After they had left,&#xD;
the house, Ina said, " Wait, Sofi, one&#xD;
moment !" and she ran back, threw&#xD;
open the window in her room, and&#xD;
kissed the vine which once shaded&#xD;
it with roses they were dead now,&#xD;
and the vine\ was'leafless, all but a&#xD;
few little yellow crumpled leaves that&#xD;
the cold winter had4left there as if in&#xD;
inockery of the Qhanges he -could&#xD;
make. Ing gathered 'them hastily,&#xD;
and thrust them into her bosom.&#xD;
" IThey seem to me a picture of my&#xD;
&#xD;
own heart,". she said bitterly, and&#xD;
then hastened back. to join Sofi,&#xD;
They found their new rooms very&#xD;
comfortable; it was a consolation to&#xD;
Ina before leaving Lucerne to know,&#xD;
that her darling was in a good place,&#xD;
and that she could stay with him&#xD;
there a few days, so that, when ab-&#xD;
sent, she could picture Sofi to herself&#xD;
with him,. and all their surroundings,&#xD;
She had written to the Benonis that&#xD;
by "some accident she had not re-&#xD;
ceived their letters until lately, that&#xD;
she accepted with gratitude their&#xD;
offer to let her return to them, and '&#xD;
she had written to her husband to&#xD;
meet her on the following Monday&#xD;
at Turin ; and now the long night-&#xD;
mare was vanishing away, and she&#xD;
felt that the time was near when she&#xD;
should really se'e him again.&#xD;
CHAPTER     VII.&#xD;
SUNDAY was passed by Ina and&#xD;
Sofi in arranging Ina's trunks&#xD;
and settling all things'before her de-&#xD;
parture.&#xD;
" Sofi," said Ina, her voice a little&#xD;
tremulous, ".I do not want you to&#xD;
cry when I go' away, and I do not&#xD;
want anybody to be .with me, only&#xD;
you. Gabriele must stay with the&#xD;
baby until you come back from the&#xD;
station; and, Sofi, you will never leave&#xD;
him alone, nor let him cry, and kiss&#xD;
him  every day for me, and tell him&#xD;
how I love him, - won't you,' Soil?&#xD;
I think he will understand it, just as&#xD;
whi the wind whispers to the&#xD;
flowers, - and, Sofi dear, you will&#xD;
promise that I shall have a letter&#xD;
&#xD;
every day; you will dictate it and&#xD;
Gabriele will. write it, but I want it&#xD;
all in your own words. I know you&#xD;
will love him just as if it were I my-&#xD;
self that wa near him.  Dear Sofi, I&#xD;
love you so truly, I feel so grateful&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
"Please do not talk so, Madam;&#xD;
you take away all my courage."&#xD;
"Well, Sofi, let us try and make&#xD;
each other strong.  I will not say an-&#xD;
other word; you understand every-&#xD;
thing as if it had been said."&#xD;
So they both went silently on with&#xD;
their preparations, not daring either&#xD;
of them to speak the thoughts that&#xD;
were in their hearts. All that night&#xD;
Ina sat by her baby's cradle, looking&#xD;
down into his closely shut eyes,&#xD;
watching the shadows as they passed&#xD;
over his little face, and then stooping&#xD;
gently to kiss him, -so gently, that&#xD;
she might not wake him. The morn-&#xD;
ing came, and found Ina still sitting&#xD;
there, pale and wan. She was obliged&#xD;
to start early, and now Sofi came and&#xD;
called her. Ina did not tell Sofi that&#xD;
she had taken no rest all night, but,&#xD;
when she   heard   her step, began&#xD;
to hurry about, as if dressing in&#xD;
haste ; and the last things were put&#xD;
away, her trunks were carried down&#xD;
stairs, she threw her arms around&#xD;
Sardo, then one long last kiss to her&#xD;
baby, as if she were giving it her&#xD;
soul, and then she turned away, and&#xD;
followed Sofi. They soon reached&#xD;
the station ;.it still wanted ten min-&#xD;
utes to the time of departure.  Soft&#xD;
could not let her lady leave so alone,&#xD;
she thought anything was better than&#xD;
that; she looked hastily around. I&#xD;
was nearly time for the train to start,&#xD;
when she saw a gentleman standing&#xD;
&#xD;
at the door of the saloon; he had&#xD;
white hair, but was still a handsome&#xD;
man, - well preserved, the world said&#xD;
of him, - with a strange mixture of&#xD;
good-nature and selfishness, worldly&#xD;
hardness and easy 'benevolence, in&#xD;
his face. Sofi had no sooner received&#xD;
the quick impression that he was a&#xD;
gentleman, and not very young, than&#xD;
she -ran up to him, leaving Ina in a&#xD;
state of utter surprise. "'Who can&#xD;
this new acquaintance be ? " she said&#xD;
to herself.&#xD;
" Pardon me, sir," said Sofi in Eng-&#xD;
lish, " but are you going to Italy'?"&#xD;
The gentleman looked down at her&#xD;
with an amused sort of smile, and&#xD;
answered with indolent indifference,&#xD;
"I am not going; can I be of any&#xD;
service to you ?"&#xD;
Sofi looked up at him with real&#xD;
distress in her eyes, and said: " 0&#xD;
no, sir, only my mistress was going,&#xD;
and she is all alone, and I felt anx-&#xD;
ious. about her; she is not used to&#xD;
travelling."&#xD;
"W/ich is your mistress?" said&#xD;
the ge tleman. .&#xD;
Sofi\ turned and pointed towards&#xD;
Ina; the gentleman raised his eye-&#xD;
glass a d looked at her for a moment&#xD;
with th scrutinizing glance of a man&#xD;
of the .world. Ina blushed scarlet&#xD;
under his gaze, au' turned away her&#xD;
head.&#xD;
"Is your mistress married ?" said&#xD;
the gentleman.&#xD;
" No," said Sofi, feeling at that mo-&#xD;
ment as- if she would have liked to&#xD;
kill Signor Bertani..&#xD;
" What is hier name ?" he said.&#xD;
"' -Mademoiselle Str5hling."&#xD;
" Ah, a German ; pretty delicate-&#xD;
looking creature ! Wait a moment I&#xD;

&#xD;
INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
have some friends who are leaving, -&#xD;
excellent people, - I will place her&#xD;
under their charge."&#xD;
"0, thank you," said Sofi,1 with&#xD;
fervor.'&#xD;
"Be sure to be near me just as the&#xD;
train is going off, and, I will see to&#xD;
it," he answered kindly.&#xD;
Sofi hastened back to Ina, to tell&#xD;
her what she had been doing. 'Ina&#xD;
felt the awkwardness of her position,&#xD;
yet she was relieved at the thought&#xD;
of not being all alone.&#xD;
"Sofi," she said, , with the tears&#xD;
welling to her eyes, "you are always&#xD;
good. I love you dearly, I would'&#xD;
trust you through -everything; take&#xD;
care of him," she said, choking, and&#xD;
now breaking down entirely in her&#xD;
grief, - "'take care of him; I put&#xD;
my all in your hands."&#xD;
"Don't cry so," said Sofi; "if you&#xD;
do not want to kill me, do not cry&#xD;
so. You will spoil your beauty fret-&#xD;
ting, and then he will not care to&#xD;
look at you."&#xD;
Ina looked at her "with. a plain-&#xD;
tive, quivering lip, like a child that&#xD;
does not know whether to smile or&#xD;
weep.&#xD;
" There  come his friends," said&#xD;
'Sofi; "now  you. stand close by me.&#xD;
Come'! there is the whistle ; do. not&#xD;
10   your  ticket, be brave, and&#xD;
write me the moment you have ar-&#xD;
rived. I shall be awfully anxious&#xD;
about you. Come quick, or I shall&#xD;
lose sight of them."&#xD;
So saying, sustaining and hurry-&#xD;
ing her mistress, Sofi hastened for-&#xD;
ward. "Premieire classe !" shouted&#xD;
the official at thie door of the car.&#xD;
"Seconde A fumer !" screamed anoth-&#xD;
er. .Sofi kept close tp her new ac-&#xD;
&#xD;
quaintance. The lady and gentlenman&#xD;
whom he was with had two little&#xD;
girls; he helped them into the cars,'&#xD;
and then, turning, said suddenly with&#xD;
perfect ease, " Ah, pardon me, I for-&#xD;
got to say that I have a young friend&#xD;
to put. under your care ; she will go&#xD;
as far as Italy, with you. Permit&#xD;
me, Miss Strdhling; Mr. and Mrs'&#xD;
Colman, - especial friends of mine,"&#xD;
There was not a second to be lost,&#xD;
Ina bowed, Sofi looked gratefully at&#xD;
the gentleman. Ina put her arms&#xD;
around   Sofi's  neck, and   sobbed,&#xD;
"Good by, dear ; remember all I told&#xD;
you; good by."&#xD;
"Good by," said Sofi, trying to&#xD;
keep up her courage for Ina's sake'&#xD;
The whistle sounded, the cars started,&#xD;
and poor Sofi stood anxiously strain.&#xD;
ing her eyes after them as they&#xD;
whirled away, whilst Ina sat leaning&#xD;
back in the cars, her face covered&#xD;
with her handkerchief; then she&#xD;
cried" silently to herself, until with&#xD;
the monotonous noise and motion of&#xD;
the train, and with utter weariness,&#xD;
she fell asleep. When she awak-&#xD;
ened she looked around, and began to&#xD;
study unconsciously the faces of her&#xD;
companions. Of course they were&#xD;
husband and wife, travelling with&#xD;
their two children and maid. The&#xD;
lady was deeply pock-marked, with&#xD;
rather a hard face, that said, nothing;&#xD;
two large, rolling eyes, which she&#xD;
evidently thought very effective, but&#xD;
which were fixed 'in their expression'&#xD;
and entirely lifeless ; a small wisp&#xD;
of canary-colored hair on her head,&#xD;
resembling very much the sparse&#xD;
down of those newly fledged birds,&#xD;
- for she had taken off her hat, un-&#xD;
fortunately for her fellow-travellers.&#xD;
&#xD;
She was very thin indeed, and had&#xD;
excessively emaciated hands,. which&#xD;
hung helplessly from her wrists. The&#xD;
gentleman by her side was a large,&#xD;
fine-looking man, with a very benev-&#xD;
olent expression.  The  two   little&#xD;
girls on the opposite side looked like&#xD;
nothing more than two bowls of&#xD;
very thin milk, each with two large&#xD;
lustreless whortleberries floating in&#xD;
them, -" My eyes !' as their moth-&#xD;
er said, fondly gazing at them with&#xD;
her own dark orbs.&#xD;
"Did you sleep, Miss Strdhling ?"&#xD;
said the lady, indolently raising her-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
'Yes," said Ina.&#xD;
"Axe you all alone ?"&#xD;
Ina thought to herself that this&#xD;
was an unnecessary question, but she&#xD;
answered again, "Yes."&#xD;
"You speak English very well,"&#xD;
said the lady feebly, in a patronizing&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
"Thank you," said Ina, trying to&#xD;
be grateful.&#xD;
"Have you ever been in Italy be-&#xD;
fore ?" said the lady.&#xD;
"Yes," said Ina, blushing.&#xD;
"You are a German, I believe,&#xD;
because your hair is light and so&#xD;
thick," said Mrs. Colman, thinking&#xD;
contentedly of her own wig, that lay&#xD;
reposing gently at that moment in&#xD;
her trunk.&#xD;
" My dear," said her husband,&#xD;
and he whispered something in her&#xD;
ear.&#xD;
"Now, darling," said Mrs. Colman,&#xD;
turning gushingly to him, and for&#xD;
the first time throwing off her sweet&#xD;
air of indlence,- "now, my darling,&#xD;
I ought to know best. This is my&#xD;
husband," she said, turning to Ina.&#xD;
&#xD;
"My husband thinks I am impor-&#xD;
tuning you with questions, -don't&#xD;
you, darling ?" looking at him with&#xD;
an attempt at coquetry; "but I say&#xD;
to ry .dear husband, I know best.&#xD;
My husband, will you lift up Sally's&#xD;
head ? do, dear ! Will you, my hus-&#xD;
band, put a pillow under our girl's&#xD;
head ? Those are my girls, Miss&#xD;
Strohling, our own, our only ones!&#xD;
My husband indulges me in every-&#xD;
thing, -- don't you, my husband, my&#xD;
precious one, my love? My hus-&#xD;
band is not demonstrativ , Miss&#xD;
Strdhling," - she always pronounced&#xD;
the " Stro5" with great emphasis; as if&#xD;
the rolling of the letter "r " was a&#xD;
sign of her perfect knowledge of the&#xD;
foreign tongue..&#xD;
Ina looked at her with surprise.&#xD;
She did not understand why she kept&#xD;
claiming Mr. Colman with such&#xD;
" damned  iterance " as hers, as&#xD;
there could be no possible doubt in&#xD;
her own mind as to the legitimacy&#xD;
of her children ; but her conjectures&#xD;
were cut short by Mrs. Colman's&#xD;
suddenly turning to her and saying,&#xD;
in undertones: " Do you not think&#xD;
it beautiful to love one's husband so&#xD;
much? I love my husband passion-&#xD;
ately, but I may say that my love is&#xD;
of the purest kind, exquisitely pure !&#xD;
Do you like art, Miss Strohling ?&#xD;
That is a great purifier to the soul.&#xD;
My husband bought me the rarest of&#xD;
the old masters' works last winter&#xD;
when we were in Italy ; my health&#xD;
is so fragile that I am obliged to&#xD;
breathe in warmer climes than our&#xD;
osvn during the cold season."&#xD;
Fortunately she did not seem to&#xD;
care very much for Miss Str~hling's&#xD;
answers, as she seldom- waiteil for&#xD;

them. "My husband," she said,'turn-&#xD;
jng tto him languidly, would you,&#xD;
my eloved, cover my knees with my&#xD;
cloa ?  My husband has to be very&#xD;
careful of his own wife, Miss Strbh-&#xD;
ling, or I fear he would lose her."&#xD;
Ina looked with increased pity at&#xD;
Mr. 'Colman, who seemed perfectly&#xD;
at his ease, his, placidity not at all&#xD;
disturbed by his wife's unusual deli-&#xD;
cacy'of constitution  Ina wondered&#xD;
how such a really pleasing-looking&#xD;
man could have married such a wo-&#xD;
man ; how he -could be so kind to&#xD;
her. What was it that bound them&#xD;
toget~ier ? Was it wealth ? or had-&#xD;
he faced the sad horrors of his des-&#xD;
tiny,, and determined 'to bear it like&#xD;
a true Christian ? She knew not. His&#xD;
face was beaming with kindness and&#xD;
intelligence.. Ina felt so sorry for&#xD;
him. It was fortunate for her that&#xD;
she had fallen in with Mr. and Mrs..&#xD;
Colman, for it took her thoughts,&#xD;
despite herself, somewhat off her&#xD;
own troubles. " I am very recherchy&#xD;
in my tastes," began Mrs. Colman&#xD;
again, " very reservey, as the French&#xD;
say ; my husband and I do not care&#xD;
to make acquaintances ; indeed, we&#xD;
think it quite vulgar touspeak  ith&#xD;
our countrymen on the Contin nt ;&#xD;
it is generally an ordinary class that&#xD;
travel ! as a gentleman said the&#xD;
other day, it is principally the canal&#xD;
of America that go abroad. We keep&#xD;
ourselves to ourselves ; it was a well-&#xD;
known fact in Paris, where the first&#xD;
salons were open to us, that we would&#xD;
not visit."&#xD;
.Ina wondered if the Emperor had&#xD;
interested himself in this fact.&#xD;
" No, I said, I-travel to enrich my&#xD;
mind; to hang pictures in it for our&#xD;
&#xD;
only ones', our girls', future ; and ie&#xD;
purchase, as we go, all the antics 'We&#xD;
find for sale. Were you ever in&#xD;
Spain, Miss Strohling ? "&#xD;
-" Never," said Ina.&#xD;
" It is very picturesque ; our jour-&#xD;
ney there was one romance. I tell-&#xD;
my husband that our life is a long&#xD;
honeymoon, - don't I, darling ?"&#xD;
But darling was looking out of the&#xD;
window, and did not answer.&#xD;
"There were a great many price-&#xD;
less pictures in Spain by tubens;&#xD;
my husband bought all he found for&#xD;
our home, to refine it. America needs&#xD;
refinement, Miss Str6hling. We have&#xD;
few acquaintances there, because my&#xD;
husband has very particular notions.&#xD;
We keep apart ; our little circle is&#xD;
complete : myself, whom my hus-&#xD;
band educated ; the sisters of my&#xD;
husband, also educated by him; and&#xD;
Nelly Worth, who is all principle&#xD;
from the crown of her head to the&#xD;
sole of her feet, - that is our chosen&#xD;
society."&#xD;
Ina was beginning heartily to wish&#xD;
that Sofi had left her to travel all&#xD;
'alone, but fortunately they had just&#xD;
arrived at the place wherethey were&#xD;
to take the diligence over the Spli.&#xD;
gen. Mr. Colman was very kind in&#xD;
attending to Ina's baggage; and as&#xD;
she thought how hard it would have"'&#xD;
been for her to go 'amongst those&#xD;
rough drivers, she .felt grateful that&#xD;
she had any one to,look after her&#xD;
interests. They travelled the whole&#xD;
night over the mountain,- Mr. and&#xD;
Mrs. Colman in happy tte-..A -tete in&#xD;
a private carriage; -mIa, with the&#xD;
children and the nurse, in the dili-&#xD;
gence that carried the mail just be.&#xD;
fore' them, so that Mrs. Colman's&#xD;
&#xD;
delicate nostrils had to  nt the&#xD;
dust of the Alps all the war. The&#xD;
children had their legs tossing over&#xD;
poor Ina all the night, but she&#xD;
id not mind   hem ; her thoughts&#xD;
were far away, now with the ' be-&#xD;
loved little roseate form that was&#xD;
sleeping with an angel smile of inno-&#xD;
cence on its face, now with him&#xD;
to whom her heart was impetuously&#xD;
hurrying ; those dark eyes were rest-&#xD;
ing on her, not seen for so long a&#xD;
time ; she was leaning on his strong&#xD;
arm, laughingly telling him of all her&#xD;
baby's, grace, happy again with the&#xD;
happiness of olden times ; all the&#xD;
troubles of the past were forgotten,&#xD;
all the tears that had been shed were&#xD;
ried; she should see him, hear his&#xD;
low voice, - was not. that enough ?&#xD;
So the dawn rose and flushed the&#xD;
mountains with loveliness ; the keen&#xD;
air blevN on Ina's cheek, and refreshed&#xD;
her after a long and sleepless night.&#xD;
She let down her long hair for a mo-&#xD;
ment; it caught one of the little girl's&#xD;
great eyes as she lay gazing at Ina,&#xD;
and she put out her hand and said:&#xD;
"How pretty 1 it dazzles just like the&#xD;
sun! how nice! we can pull it, and&#xD;
it does n't cbe off like mamma's."&#xD;
Ina could not help smiling.&#xD;
They stopped at a little village to&#xD;
rest for a few hurs before taking&#xD;
the boat down Lake Como. .Ina&#xD;
threw herself on the bed, and' was&#xD;
soon fast asleep ; she was waked by&#xD;
Mrs. Colman's voice saying at her&#xD;
. door, "Miss Strbhling, I am sorry&#xD;
to disturb you, but I think it is time&#xD;
you should be up."&#xD;
" Thank you," said Ina in her&#xD;
broken English, " you are very&#xD;
kind;" 'and she sprang up and pre-&#xD;
&#xD;
pared herself quickly for her further&#xD;
journey.&#xD;
Mrs. Colman was awaiting her&#xD;
with a smile full of languor. "Did&#xD;
you rest well ?" she said. " I do not&#xD;
think I should live long if I travelled&#xD;
so rapidly for a great way ; we. do&#xD;
not - my husband and myself - ap-&#xD;
prove of the American mode of trav-&#xD;
elling ; this constant motion is quite&#xD;
vulgar, repose is true elegance !"&#xD;
- They went on to the boat together.&#xD;
" Have you observed," said Mrs.&#xD;
Colman, "that my chest is too round'?&#xD;
I am not naturally deformed, I would&#xD;
not have you think so, but," she said,&#xD;
lowering her voice, " I wear a large&#xD;
box on my breast constantly, when&#xD;
travelling ; they are my peerless&#xD;
jewels, pearls from the Orient and&#xD;
diamonds which a Spanish prince&#xD;
collected for his bride, and just as the&#xD;
marriage was about to be consum-&#xD;
mated he died; it was sad for them,&#xD;
but a great bargain for Mr.. Colman."&#xD;
Ina was obliged to take a seat by&#xD;
Mrs. Colman; after her children had&#xD;
been caressed sufficiently, she turned&#xD;
to Ina and said, " 0 my darlings, my&#xD;
cherished ones, how proud I am of&#xD;
them! Had you really, Miss Stroh-&#xD;
ling, observed my chest ?"  Ina did&#xD;
now, and thought with a smile what&#xD;
would her form be when she reNoved&#xD;
the only thing which apparently&#xD;
gave it any consistency of shape at&#xD;
all.&#xD;
"You cannot imagine," continued&#xD;
Mrs. Colman, " how I look when I&#xD;
am dressed ! My husband is very fond&#xD;
of me when I am in full toilet. 'Since&#xD;
our own, the birthi of our first, he&#xD;
has not been willing that I should&#xD;
wear low neck, so I wear Pompy-&#xD;

&#xD;
door; my diamonds lie around my&#xD;
throat, and I wear acoronet in my&#xD;
hair ; it is elegant, with my pearls&#xD;
from  the Orient in myears,-you&#xD;
cannot judge of me as you see me&#xD;
here!"&#xD;
Ina smiled again as she thought&#xD;
o the hair that came off, but Mrs.&#xD;
Colman had a frank, opennature, and&#xD;
she. quickly added: "I brought a&#xD;
French maid with me from Paris to&#xD;
dress my wig last winter.   I am&#xD;
obliged ,to wear one. I shall take&#xD;
her for that express purpose to Amer-&#xD;
ica; she does it exquisitely ! My&#xD;
husband has prepared me a home&#xD;
there Miss Strbhling, and a very&#xD;
lovely one it is, with art in the cham-&#xD;
bers, blood horses in our stable, glass'&#xD;
coaches from  Paris! I am  sure I&#xD;
ought to love hin; he has the purest&#xD;
nature I think I ever knew !"&#xD;
Ina looked up, and said: " Mrs.&#xD;
Colman, I think you ought to be&#xD;
perfectly happy, with a husband so&#xD;
devoted, two near little children, -a&#xD;
beautiful home, horses, diamonds,,&#xD;
everything !"&#xD;
"My dear," said Mrs. Colman,&#xD;
with a pleased smile of self-compla-&#xD;
cence, "I-deserve it all."&#xD;
This cut short all further argu-&#xD;
ment, and now Mr. Colman came up,&#xD;
and pointed out to Ina all the most&#xD;
remarkable places on the lake.&#xD;
Ina saw that Mrs. Colman was&#xD;
looking at her very eagerly, her great&#xD;
empty eagle eyes growing full of an-&#xD;
gry light; she moved away, and sat&#xD;
down. Mr. Colmian followed her,&#xD;
and offered to hold her parasol. -&#xD;
"No, thank you:' said Ina; "I can&#xD;
shade myself."&#xD;
"My dear," said Mrs. Colman,&#xD;
&#xD;
"Miss Strohling is perfectly able to&#xD;
see. for herself, and to take care of&#xD;
herself also, I should think.",&#xD;
Ina was annoyed ; she took up a&#xD;
book, and read until. it was time o&#xD;
take the cars again. Just as she was&#xD;
getting in, Mr. Colman kindly pla.&#xD;
cing her bag inside of the door, Mrs.&#xD;
Colman, suddenly     forgetting  her&#xD;
graceful languor, pulled him away&#xD;
with a' jerk and said, " Come into&#xD;
this car." Ina was only too glad to&#xD;
be left alone, and so on they went,&#xD;
speeding towards- their destiny, on&#xD;
and on. She would have been glad&#xD;
if the cars had never stopped.. Once&#xD;
Mr. Colman came to ask if he could&#xD;
get her anything to eat. Ina had&#xD;
just thought what-a comfort it would&#xD;
be to have something, when she&#xD;
heard Mrs. Colman's shrillvoice from&#xD;
the other car calling out, " My hus-&#xD;
band, you will be late ! my husband,,&#xD;
come!"&#xD;
He stopped and said, "Do let me&#xD;
help you to something."&#xD;
" No, thank you," said Ina, "noth-&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
The cars had forty minutes to&#xD;
wait, so Mr. Colman had time suffi-&#xD;
cient to return to his wife, and Ina&#xD;
jumped out herself and bought some&#xD;
grapes and cakes that were standing&#xD;
on the table of the restaurant. On&#xD;
and on, hour after hour, they travelled,&#xD;
until at last they were approaching,&#xD;
Turin. 0, how her heart beat ! what'&#xD;
were time and distance now ? She-&#xD;
should see him soon, and the cars&#xD;
slackened their pace, and stopped.&#xD;
She seized her bag and cloak, turned&#xD;
to bow to Mr. and Mrs. Colman,&#xD;
strained her eyes through the morn-&#xD;
ing mist to see if the one being on&#xD;
&#xD;
earth for her was there, uttered a&#xD;
low scream of joy, and sprang for-&#xD;
ward into Emanuele Bertani's arms.&#xD;
He held her to him for a momex,&#xD;
glanced hastily around to see if any&#xD;
one were looking at them, and then,&#xD;
withdrawing his arms from her, led&#xD;
her away to the carriage that was&#xD;
awaiting them.&#xD;
"Have you your ticket," he said,&#xD;
"for your trunks ? "&#xD;
"0 yes, but I do not care for&#xD;
them; only come, and let me be once&#xD;
more a moment with you."&#xD;
"In a second, and I am all yours,&#xD;
Ina."&#xD;
He ran to find her trunks,'and re-&#xD;
turned with a man carrying them ;&#xD;
they were thrown up on to the car-&#xD;
riage, the door was closed, and she&#xD;
was once more alone with Emanuele.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
IN an elegantly furnished parlor&#xD;
in Turin, in one of those houses&#xD;
which front on the beautiful piazza&#xD;
where is the . statue- of Emanuele&#xD;
Filiberto, a little group of people&#xD;
were sitting at about twelve o'clock&#xD;
in the morning : one of these was&#xD;
an elderly gentleman with a face&#xD;
from which the rarest benevolence&#xD;
shone; kindness and good-humor&#xD;
sparkled in his eyes, and he had a&#xD;
smile when he spoke, that, as Ina&#xD;
said, almost lit the room. She had&#xD;
never seen any one else smile so&#xD;
entirely until she had seen her wh~n&#xD;
sh~e always called her Princess. On&#xD;
the sofa half reclined, -in an indolent&#xD;
attitude, this gentleman's wife. Just&#xD;
&#xD;
by her side sat in demure propriety&#xD;
two pale young girls ; they looked&#xD;
as if they needed country air,' and&#xD;
something of the freedom of the&#xD;
country too. ' A young gentleman&#xD;
with an easy, elegant air was stand-&#xD;
ing by the mantel watching a very&#xD;
handsome yoig woman who was&#xD;
talking with his mother. The young&#xD;
widow -for such she was -- was.&#xD;
handsomely dressed in a black velvet&#xD;
walking-costume, trimmed with rich&#xD;
sable furs, and a black velvet bonnet;&#xD;
the tiniest little muff was hanging&#xD;
suspended by a rich gold chain to&#xD;
one of the button-holes of her waist;&#xD;
her * hand. was playing with a gold&#xD;
card-case which sparkled with jewels;&#xD;
her glove was lying onher lap, and&#xD;
the hand which was ungloved was&#xD;
dazzlingly white, and all the more&#xD;
so from the contrast it made as it&#xD;
lay on her dark dress.&#xD;
"I do not know," she said, appar-&#xD;
ently in answer to a question. that&#xD;
had been put her by the gentleman&#xD;
who was standing. " I always think&#xD;
of those lines that I as the Countess&#xD;
repeated that evening we gave 'The&#xD;
Follies' of a ibight,' at Madame&#xD;
Arnaud's, -&#xD;
'Pleasure calls, and from her corps&#xD;
absent ont toujours tort,' &#xD;
do you remember it? " she said, look-&#xD;
ing up at him with an arch smile.&#xD;
"I remember that -you were ra-&#xD;
diant then, as ever."&#xD;
"And I remember that you did&#xD;
not once applaud me; that you stood&#xD;
sternly looking in royal displeasure&#xD;
at me, as if I were something that&#xD;
you even honored with your pres-&#xD;
ence;' she said, laughing. " By the&#xD;
way, did-you not tell me that Madem-&#xD;

&#xD;
oiselle Ina was about to return to&#xD;
yot ?" -&#xD;
'We are expecting her to-day,"&#xD;
said Madame Benoni, with an indo-&#xD;
lent manner, as oif it were rather an&#xD;
exertion to her to speak at all; "and&#xD;
I do hope, when she comes, that we&#xD;
shall have some quiet in the house, -&#xD;
not that my children mean to be&#xD;
noisy, Madame de Turenne, not that&#xD;
they would, I suppose, willingly hurt&#xD;
their mother's feelings, but my nerves&#xD;
are in such a delicate state that I&#xD;
can bear less than other people. I&#xD;
do not mean to complain, but I must&#xD;
say," laying great stress on all her&#xD;
verbs, "that I should have thought&#xD;
their father would assist me during&#xD;
the very long and painful absence&#xD;
of Mademoiselle Strohling."&#xD;
"Uarissima mia," said that kind-&#xD;
hearted gentleman, " I thought I&#xD;
had done everything I could to re-.&#xD;
lieve you of your cares. I have not&#xD;
been to my clubonce since she left,&#xD;
that I might stay and read to my&#xD;
girls ; and this,".he said gayly, "is&#xD;
the'reward of all my martyrdom."&#xD;
"Well, my dear, I am sorry you&#xD;
think it martyrdom. I afn very&#xD;
sorry that we have all deprived you&#xD;
of so much pleasure! I reo-ret it&#xD;
always deeply when I am    in any&#xD;
one's way, but I should have thought&#xD;
it would be a consolation to you to&#xD;
teach your own children."&#xD;
"And your own too, my dear, I&#xD;
believe," he said, laughing.&#xD;
"I shouldhave supposed, Signor&#xD;
B3enoni, that this remark might have&#xD;
been spared me ; there is a want of&#xD;
good taste in it, not to say delicacy"&#xD;
. only before our girls I am mortified&#xD;
that you force me to use the word."&#xD;
&#xD;
ier husband laughed again.&#xD;
"My dear, if you would spare me&#xD;
that laugh! it does fall on my nerves!&#xD;
Not tlat I suppose you intentionally&#xD;
would be so thoughtless as to laugh&#xD;
so loud, but I must confess that it'&#xD;
distresses me. I have spoken of it&#xD;
so often, and I should have thought&#xD;
you would have sought, during the&#xD;
many years of our married life, to&#xD;
correct a habit which you knew was&#xD;
personally disagreeable to me; but&#xD;
I see," she said, with a deep sigh,&#xD;
"that it is useless to cherish any&#xD;
hopes."&#xD;
'Is Monsieur Bertani still inti-&#xD;
mate at your house ?" said Madame&#xD;
de Turenne. She knew that he was,&#xD;
and had come there to call that&#xD;
morning with a faint hope of meet.&#xD;
' ing him.&#xD;
" He visits us," said Madame Be-&#xD;
noni, with a self-complacent smile,&#xD;
"more intimately, perhaps, than any&#xD;
other person in Turin."&#xD;
" 0 my dear child," said Monsieur&#xD;
Benoni, "-Bertani is everywhere ; he&#xD;
is the best man I know; he is, in-&#xD;
deed, the only minister we have had&#xD;
for years that has filled his place!&#xD;
He is' not a renegade to his own&#xD;
principles, like Ricasoli, nor a pan-&#xD;
derer  to  the  King, like Ratazzi&#xD;
What he means, he says ; perhaps&#xD;
he is a, little ambitious, but that is a&#xD;
virtue rather than a defect."&#xD;
"Well, my dear, I am very glad&#xD;
you so fully appreciate our friend&#xD;
Bertani,-yes, I may say very glad,&#xD;
- but why you'say he is everywhere&#xD;
Ido not know ; why you are not&#xD;
willing to accept the compliment he&#xD;
pays to this house I must confess I&#xD;
do not quite understand. I say&#xD;
&#xD;
openly that I am proud of Signor&#xD;
Bertani's very marked preference of&#xD;
our house to any other, - yes, I&#xD;
may say to any other."&#xD;
Monsieur Marcello looked at his&#xD;
mother very quietly, and then at&#xD;
Madame de Turenne, to see if she was'&#xD;
laughing at her, -he could not have&#xD;
forgiven that -but she was listen-&#xD;
ing with the greatest apparent defer-&#xD;
ence to all that fell from the lips of&#xD;
Madame Benoni.&#xD;
"Mademoiselle Ina," said Madame&#xD;
de Turenne, "is a lovely creature to&#xD;
look at; I used to' think that Mon-&#xD;
sieur Bertani or Monsieur Marcello&#xD;
would have been lost in her charms,&#xD;
being in such constant intercourse&#xD;
with her !"&#xD;
"Neither Monsieur Bertani nor&#xD;
my son Marcello will, I trust, ever&#xD;
demean themselves by a misalli-&#xD;
ance," said Madame Benoni, forget-&#xD;
ting for a moment her over-suscepti-&#xD;
ble nerves, and rising' partly from&#xD;
her Oriental attitude.&#xD;
"I do not know what you mean by&#xD;
that expression," said her son. "I&#xD;
do not wish to make the conversation'&#xD;
personal, but I utterly detest that&#xD;
word. I see no misalliance at all&#xD;
between a beautiful, highly educated&#xD;
young woman, and a minister who&#xD;
has raised himself to his position&#xD;
merely through his own talents, or,"&#xD;
he said, laughing, " a young man who&#xD;
owes, perhaps, all the position he has&#xD;
in the beau monde to the good fortune&#xD;
of having a rich father. This coun-&#xD;
try ia detestable with its aristocrat-&#xD;
ic prejudices, which permeate all&#xD;
classes." .&#xD;
"Well, iniy dear Marcello, I think&#xD;
it would have been, perhaps, more&#xD;
&#xD;
respectful to have spoken less open-&#xD;
ly of your mother's faults. I had&#xD;
thought that you would have shel-&#xD;
tered her from any attack, that you&#xD;
would have defended her from the&#xD;
shafts of calumny ; but I see that it&#xD;
is not well to expect too much from&#xD;
one's son, or one must be deeply&#xD;
disappointed."&#xD;
Marcello was silent before this re-&#xD;
buke ; it was very seldom that he&#xD;
answered any of his mother's argu-&#xD;
ments ; unless -what she said had&#xD;
particularly nettled him, he chafed&#xD;
in silence at her remarks.&#xD;
"I did not see you last night,&#xD;
Monsieur Marcello, at the opera. I&#xD;
wonder you' did not go. I have&#xD;
scarcely ever known a man so little&#xD;
a, votary of pleasure as you are.&#xD;
I, au 'contraire, like t live pour&#xD;
m'amuser.    All the   world  was&#xD;
there last evening; they gave 'Le&#xD;
Prophate.' It was   really. g  d ;&#xD;
there is a moment when in that&#xD;
royal march the music rises to such&#xD;
intensity that it is almost impossible&#xD;
to sit still, one scarcely breathes&#xD;
with excitement. I do not believe&#xD;
in the world there is a people that&#xD;
feels music as we do; it seems to&#xD;
penetrate every fibre, ito creep into&#xD;
every crevice of the Italian. There&#xD;
is something beautiful in feeling that&#xD;
mere sound can give such an ex-&#xD;
quisite sense of enjoyment. Madame&#xD;
de Stael used to say that Paris is the&#xD;
place where one can best do without&#xD;
happiness; but I think it' is Italy,&#xD;
because we have music in ourselves."&#xD;
"I was there last evening," he&#xD;
said, "and enjoyed the opera, and I&#xD;
also enjoyed turning my lorgnom&#xD;
towards a certain box where beauty&#xD;

&#xD;
and talent were seated, absorbed in&#xD;
one another."&#xD;
"Were they in one person," she&#xD;
said, indifferently, " or in two ?"&#xD;
"The two were in one," he said,&#xD;
bowing to her, "and I sometimes&#xD;
fear the one was in two."&#xD;
"You are very enigmatical, Mon-&#xD;
sieur Marcello, and I confess I am&#xD;
not clever enough to understand you."&#xD;
"It is the first time that you have&#xD;
done me the honor to mistake me&#xD;
for a sphinx."&#xD;
Madame de Turenne took out her&#xD;
watch; opened it indolently ; there&#xD;
was a little crown in emeralds set in&#xD;
white enamel on the back. "I hate&#xD;
these little stones," she said; "they&#xD;
make me think always of green-eyed&#xD;
jealousy."&#xD;
"You were never jealous, I sup-&#xD;
pose ? " said Monsieur Marcello.&#xD;
"I trust not," the said, her eyes&#xD;
slightly flashing, "nor that I ever&#xD;
shall be ; I should be terrible."&#xD;
" Yes," he said,'laughing. " I can&#xD;
imagine you as a magnificent Phedre,&#xD;
or a Medea, or as Norma. Poor&#xD;
Adelgisa ! she would stand very&#xD;
little chance !"&#xD;
" You are impitoyable," she said,&#xD;
"incorrigible ; if i, were not for our&#xD;
old acquaintance, and that you had&#xD;
openly forsworn my colors, I would&#xD;
not forgive you."&#xD;
"'Au contraire," he said, "I en-&#xD;
tered the lists for them, but found&#xD;
them on another's breast, - and hid-&#xD;
den, too, where they never would&#xD;
have been discerned save for a fall&#xD;
and a bad wound."&#xD;
Madame de Turenne bh~ished scar-&#xD;
let "I mux~st gol' she said; "IL see ;&#xD;
you are implacable to-day !" She i&#xD;
&#xD;
rose to leave, the room, when sud-&#xD;
denly the door opened, and an excla.&#xD;
mation of joy from the two girls,&#xD;
who hitherto had sat like carved&#xD;
statues, made Madame de Turenne&#xD;
look up ; there stood Ina before her&#xD;
and, just behind, Signor.Bertani.&#xD;
"0 1xry dear Mademoiselle," said&#xD;
Madame Benoni, " I ani really grate.&#xD;
ful to see you here ;. this will be a&#xD;
comfort to their father and to me.&#xD;
We thought you had entirely forgot.&#xD;
ten us."&#xD;
" Ah,  Mademoiselle    Strohling,"&#xD;
said Monsieur Benoni, " you are&#xD;
very welcome indeed ; home did not&#xD;
half seem home withoutyou !"&#xD;
"I must say," said Madame Be-&#xD;
noni, " that to me that seems a most&#xD;
superfluous remark; however, chacun&#xD;
a son godt, as the French say." The&#xD;
two young girls rose timidly, and a&#xD;
smile lit their sallow faces as they&#xD;
went towards Ina; she stooped and&#xD;
kissed them warmly.&#xD;
"Mademoiselle Strohling, we were&#xD;
just speaking of you," said Madame&#xD;
de Turenne, " and," she said archly,&#xD;
"a gentleman said that you were&#xD;
very lovely, which no lady here&#xD;
present dared to deny."&#xD;
" Mademoiselle Strohling has not&#xD;
noticed one who would be glad to&#xD;
claim her as an old friend," said&#xD;
Monsieur Marcello, for the first time&#xD;
coming forward.&#xD;
"Take off your bonnet, my dear,"&#xD;
said Madame Benoni; " we feel grate-&#xD;
ful to Monsieur Bertani for so kindly&#xD;
offering to go for you; his real friend-&#xD;
ship for the family makes him always&#xD;
thoughtful of . all their interests. I&#xD;
must say that I wish I could say ha&#xD;
much for many others."&#xD;
&#xD;
," Thank you," said Ina; "how  i&#xD;
natural it looks here ! I am glad to t&#xD;
be back in my old place."          t&#xD;
" You look very pale, my dear," t&#xD;
said Madame Benoni; "you are shock- U&#xD;
ingly changed,, my dear Miss Stroh- v&#xD;
nY                              t&#xD;
ling "t&#xD;
How is your brother ? " said I&#xD;
Monsieur Benoni, looking up kindly&#xD;
from his paper, which he was read-r&#xD;
ing in the window.&#xD;
Ina blushed. crimson, and stam-&#xD;
mered out, " He is well, thank you."]&#xD;
" But he was very ill, I fear," said&#xD;
Monsieur Benoni, warmly.&#xD;
"-Yes," said Ina, not raising her#&#xD;
eyes. When she did do so, she met&#xD;
Monsieur Marcello's fixed  on 'her&#xD;
with a scrutinizing gaze ; she colored-&#xD;
again, and her eyes fell.&#xD;
"Has Signor Bertani so much time&#xD;
to spare ?" said Madame de Turenne,&#xD;
by whose side he now stood.&#xD;
"He is always at the command of&#xD;
his friends," he answered.&#xD;
- " And they are very, very few ?"&#xD;
.she asked, looking up with her lan-&#xD;
guid eyes in his face.&#xD;
"Quality makes up for quantity,"&#xD;
he said, laughing.&#xD;
" And who is so happy as to pos-&#xD;
sess that quality ?" she said.&#xD;
"She who is so flattering as to put&#xD;
the question," he answered.&#xD;
"I must go," said Madame de Tu-&#xD;
renne. " Mademoiselle Strdhling, I&#xD;
should be enchantee to see you at&#xD;
my house, when Madame Benoni&#xD;
favors me with a visit."&#xD;
"You are very kind,"  id Ia.&#xD;
"Let me see you to your coach,"1&#xD;
said Bertani, who knew that Madame&#xD;
de~ Tmenne was at Madame Benoni's,&#xD;
as he had seen her carriage standing&#xD;
&#xD;
n the street, and this was the reason&#xD;
hat he had not bade Ina farewell at&#xD;
he door, as he had previously in-&#xD;
ended, so as not to seem too partic-&#xD;
ular in his attentions by coming in&#xD;
with her, as the morning was always&#xD;
he time when he was supposed to&#xD;
be most completely occupied.&#xD;
"No, thankyou," she said; "I will&#xD;
go alone." Bertani did not insist, and.&#xD;
Marcello stood without offering his&#xD;
services, as he had seen those of&#xD;
Bertani rejected; she courtesied low,&#xD;
and left. the room.&#xD;
" She is very handsome," said Ber-&#xD;
tani, " very elegant-looking."&#xD;
"She has been accustomed," said&#xD;
Marcello, "from childhood, to the&#xD;
most aristocratic society, so that 'her&#xD;
manners are certainly elegant, and&#xD;
she is handsome too; but I do not&#xD;
fancy her style. She has been too&#xD;
much used to -conquering ; wherever&#xD;
she moves she has her suite of ad-&#xD;
mirers, and the greater the number&#xD;
of her victims, the better she, esteems&#xD;
it for her credit,; she is clever and&#xD;
cultivated, but rather heartless, I fear,&#xD;
and I own I do not like that kind of&#xD;
woman, even though she were as&#xD;
beautiful as a Venus."&#xD;
"Pique, my dear Marcello, pique&#xD;
breathes in every word you say; the,&#xD;
fair creature has not yet said, 'Nul&#xD;
ne touche a la reine except6 le roi.&#xD;
Levez-vous,   roi   de  Lion,    mon&#xD;
4poux!"&#xD;
"Perhaps it is so," said Marcello,&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;
" But I must be off," said Bertani.&#xD;
." I have to go to the Conuhittee of&#xD;
the Chamber before, it rises to-day. I&#xD;
shall step in this evening to 'dee&#xD;
how you all are, and I hope Mad-&#xD;

INA.                               61&#xD;
&#xD;
emoiselle Strohling will have rested&#xD;
from her long journey."&#xD;
In the mean time Madame' de Tu&#xD;
renne, the object of so much discus&#xD;
sion, had gone unaccompanied t&#xD;
her coach for the simple reason tha&#xD;
she did not want Signor Bertani t(&#xD;
see that she already had a gentleman&#xD;
with her. A handsome young man&#xD;
'sprang from the carriage, and helped&#xD;
her in, and then followed her and&#xD;
took the empty seat by her side.-&#xD;
"You were an age, Camilla,", he&#xD;
said'; "I saw that god- of the day,&#xD;
Bertani, pass in with a charming&#xD;
young creature, and I suppose the&#xD;
interesting Pylades was within."&#xD;
"Yes," said Madame de Turenne,&#xD;
"he was there."&#xD;
"Camilla, how cold your lovely&#xD;
face looks, and you were warm and&#xD;
radiant as the sun just before you&#xD;
left me here ; you have as many&#xD;
moods as the day has hours, but&#xD;
you. are' always beautiful in my&#xD;
eyes." He took her hand.,&#xD;
Camilla drew it impatiently away.&#xD;
"Why' are you so changed of late&#xD;
to me? You used to let your hand&#xD;
lie in mine."&#xD;
"My heart is an instrument dif-&#xD;
ferently' tuned at different times,"&#xD;
she said, with some petulance.&#xD;
Camilla, do not be so unkind, so&#xD;
unlike yourself!"&#xD;
"'If it were unlike myself, then it&#xD;
would not be me, so it should not&#xD;
trouble you at all !"&#xD;
"I adore you," said the young&#xD;
gentleman at her side.&#xD;
"And I am tired of adoration ; I&#xD;
want to be loved, and esteemed, and&#xD;
not; treated like a goddess ; there is&#xD;
nothing makes one feel so like fall-&#xD;
&#xD;
d ing down and crushing the adorer to&#xD;
atoms, as to be placed on a pedestal&#xD;
too high for one's own estimation of&#xD;
- one's self."&#xD;
o    "But T see no faults' in you Ca-&#xD;
t milla; to me you are divine: a Juno,&#xD;
a Pomona, a Cleopatra, a Niobe, a&#xD;
'saint, all in one."&#xD;
"You ought to see my faults, I&#xD;
wish you would ! You know I am&#xD;
haughty, proud, imperious, impa.&#xD;
tient, and a hundred other; detesta-&#xD;
ble things; why do you not hate&#xD;
me for them ? "&#xD;
"You did not once speak to me&#xD;
so; you used to listen to me whilst a&#xD;
sweet smile parted your lips, - those&#xD;
lips; Camilla, so warm to the touch."&#xD;
"If you have ever had a favor&#xD;
from a woman, you should not boast&#xD;
of .it, or she will despise you! I&#xD;
* thought I loved you once. I was&#xD;
not coquetting with you; I felt lone.&#xD;
ly, and you came ! I warned you&#xD;
from loving me. I told you I never&#xD;
knew my own mind, that I was&#xD;
fickle, that if you wantedto bask in&#xD;
the sun whilst it was warm, well,&#xD;
but that it might be withdrawn from&#xD;
you at any time ! I never said&#xD;
I would marry you; I. never told&#xD;
you it was forever, and now it is&#xD;
past. I would have told you before,&#xD;
but I was not sure of it myself;&#xD;
now forewarned is forearmed. I&#xD;
am your friend if you wish it, but.do&#xD;
not talk to me of love."&#xD;
The young man's eyes filled with&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
*"Is it indeed true ?." he said, de-&#xD;
spair in his tones.&#xD;
- "Do not be angry with me, Miro,"&#xD;
she said, putting her beautiful hand4&#xD;
over his. "I never really meant to&#xD;
&#xD;
deceive you; I want to be frank and&#xD;
true. I am in my words, but some-&#xD;
how I cannot be in my actions, and&#xD;
then you suffer for it."  '&#xD;
"You have made me miserable fbr&#xD;
life," he said with anguish. "I wish&#xD;
I could hate you,.but everything you&#xD;
do seems to fascinate me,more and&#xD;
more, and even when you show all&#xD;
your heartlessness most, even then&#xD;
one must forgive you!"&#xD;
"Ah," said Camilla, leaning her&#xD;
head against her hand, and looking&#xD;
at him earnestly, " do not curse me !&#xD;
Suppose I were to find that I had a&#xD;
heart, that all I had made others&#xD;
suffer so cruelly, and never realized&#xD;
at all, noiv should come back to me !&#xD;
that for every pang given I felt one&#xD;
myself; suppose'I too could not rest,&#xD;
and that there should come a time&#xD;
when I could not eat or sleep at all!&#xD;
God forbid !" she said. "II seem to&#xD;
feel it as it all might be ;-would it&#xD;
not be dreadful? I never thought&#xD;
of that; would that not be revenge&#xD;
for all, all that I have caused to&#xD;
suffer? would that not suffice you,&#xD;
Miro ? 0, do not wish such terrible&#xD;
suffering to me, I could not bear it !"&#xD;
"Why then did you make others&#xD;
suffer so much,? why did you never&#xD;
stop to think of all your eyes said,&#xD;
with their deep glances, and of all&#xD;
the, heaven on your lips ?"-&#xD;
"As I told you," she said, almost&#xD;
sullenly, " I nev r thought of it at all.&#xD;
I only wanted to feel less lonely my-&#xD;
-self for the time being; I drank a&#xD;
little of the intoxicating draught of&#xD;
pleasure, because I could not find&#xD;
happiness, -.and now, Miro, I do not&#xD;
want you to torment me any more ;&#xD;
it is torture to me every time you&#xD;
&#xD;
touch me ; all that is past, you must&#xD;
just be my friend or nothing ! will&#xD;
you consent ?"&#xD;
"I will not accept, Madame, so&#xD;
ignominious a position ; you have&#xD;
played with me long enough, you&#xD;
have led me on and onby the load-&#xD;
stone of your eyes until I was blind-&#xD;
ed; you will regret it, perhaps, sooner&#xD;
or later."&#xD;
"Miro," she said,- with a smile all&#xD;
grace and captivation, " will you not.&#xD;
forgive and forget ? will you not love&#xD;
me a little still ?"&#xD;
"0 Camilla, if you speak and look&#xD;
thus, you know I am your slave&#xD;
again at your feet. Do you love me ?"&#xD;
he said passionately.&#xD;
"No," she answered coldly. " I see&#xD;
how it will be; I shall have to an-&#xD;
swer for this too. ,I shall miss you,&#xD;
Miro, but it is better that we should&#xD;
part now."&#xD;
The carriage stopped at a jeweller's&#xD;
shop, where she had ordered the&#xD;
coachman to drive. "Will you come&#xD;
in with me?" she said winningly ;&#xD;
"just a few moments more!"&#xD;
" No," he said, "it is enough." He&#xD;
touched his hat and turned the cor-&#xD;
ner. Camilla's first impulse was to&#xD;
run after him, her second to go in&#xD;
and look at a diamond pin of the new-&#xD;
est mode;. but it did not tempt her&#xD;
now, and the stones fell cold and&#xD;
lifeless on her eyes.&#xD;
CHAPTER X1    .&#xD;
AND Ina, -she had left Madame&#xD;
Benoni's parlor after Emanuele&#xD;
had gone, she hgd been shown into&#xD;

the same room that she had occupied would think. He would find a heavy&#xD;
eleven months ago ; there everything stone . instead of the fresh beating&#xD;
was unchanged ; she remembered heart that once was there. He Was&#xD;
just where she had laid her Schiller not the same, yet he was kind; he&#xD;
just before she had left, and there it drew me close to him, and kissed&#xD;

of paper she.had torn a little piece spoke to me, and looked at me ten-&#xD;
from to write a hurried note to Eman- derly, and yet my own Emanuel e&#xD;
uele, to tell him when she should was not there, and when I longed&#xD;
leave. Madame Benoni's house. She. with -my whole soul to fling my arms&#xD;

with what intense but happy agita- the change lay; perhaps it was, he&#xD;

and her heart-almost ceased to beat chilled him, and he would not speak&#xD;
as she thought of all that had passed for fear of troubling me the first&#xD;
since. Here alb was so quiet, so un- day. If I could but be alone with&#xD;

the same ; there was not oneS trace house, where nothing ever escapes&#xD;
left- of the gay, happy young crea- Madame Benoni's eyes, and where I&#xD;
ture that had once trod that floor; am never alone? Ah, I feel as if an&#xD;
then her footstep was light, frees and iron net were closing around me.&#xD;
careless, now it was heavy as lead. Give me fresh air, let me breathe&#xD;
She looked in the mirror, and it again the     breath  of the   alpine&#xD;
came over her now for the first time mountains, I am  suffocated here!"&#xD;
the great - change that had taken she said, throwing open the window;&#xD;
place in her appearance ; it was as if but opposite, only a monotonous row&#xD;
she had not seen herself reflected in of elegant' houses met her eye. "I&#xD;
a glass for all that long time. Where want to be with Sofi again, and with&#xD;
now was the young girl with glad my boy ; they know no change!"-Ina&#xD;
blue eyes, rounded   form, and the exchanged her travelling-dress for a&#xD;
fresh bloom  of youth about her? dinner suit, and then rang the bell;:&#xD;
There stood. opposite Ina - a pale wo- the servant answered it immediately.&#xD;
man with sorrowful eyes; she started,  "Will you kindly tell the young&#xD;
- could it indeed be she ? She sat ladies that I should be glad !to see&#xD;
clown again, and said musingly to theni ?--.Anything is better," she said&#xD;
herself: "IHe did not tell me that to herself, "than this stifling loneli-&#xD;
he found me frightfully changed ; ness."&#xD;
that was good -of him. I wonder, if In a moment more the young girls&#xD;
he could glance within, what he entered her room. It was sad to&#xD;
&#xD;
INA.                        63.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ina to see so little life in their faces ;&#xD;
they were old before their time ;&#xD;
their mother pruned away and cut&#xD;
down all that was superfluous, as&#xD;
she thought, in their natures. Ina&#xD;
thought, as she  looked  at them,&#xD;
"Poor things ! they have not even&#xD;
had a happy childhood., I had that&#xD;
when my dear another lived.  I wish&#xD;
I could be with some one who&#xD;
looked happy ! The only person who&#xD;
seemed glad of anything was Madame&#xD;
de Turenne-; she has everything, life&#xD;
seems spread out like a rich banquet&#xD;
before her!"&#xD;
"Are you glad to see me back&#xD;
again?" said Ina, feeling as if she&#xD;
must say something.&#xD;
"0, very !" they both answered in'&#xD;
the same breath, and a little color&#xD;
came into their pale cheeks.&#xD;
"What did you study while I was&#xD;
gone, Adelheide ?"-      .&#xD;
"We studied with mamma, but&#xD;
she said we made her nervous.&#xD;
Marcello would ,have taught us, but&#xD;
he is busy in the daytime, and at&#xD;
night papa wanted us all to himself;&#xD;
only mamma said she must be there&#xD;
too, and so we did not learn as&#xD;
much, because, if we ask a question,&#xD;
mamma says it falls on her nerves."&#xD;
"And whom did you see when I&#xD;
was away ? "&#xD;
"0, nobody; if there is any formal&#xD;
company, then we stay up stairs."&#xD;
"But you were there to-day when.&#xD;
Madame de Turenne was there."&#xD;
"0 yes, but then she is so inti-&#xD;
mate at our house, and mamma did&#xD;
not receive any one else- yesterday.&#xD;
Marcello 'stayed at home' from his&#xD;
business for the first time; I do not&#xD;
know why."&#xD;
&#xD;
"And Signor Bertani," said Ina,&#xD;
"'does he not come as often as&#xD;
usual ?"&#xD;
"0 yes, but we are afraid of him."&#xD;
"Afraid of your papa's and your&#xD;
brother's best friend !"&#xD;
"Yes. Marie says he looks like a&#xD;
black cloud, but mamma reproved&#xD;
her, and said she did not wish her&#xD;
children ever to use figurative ex-&#xD;
pressions ; what did that mean, Miss&#xD;
Strdhling ? We did not like to ask&#xD;
mamma, for she says she never feels&#xD;
so well if we put any questions to&#xD;
her."&#xD;
" It means poetical," said Ina.&#xD;
"Does it ?" said Maria. "I should&#xD;
think mamma would be glad to&#xD;
have me say anything that sounds&#xD;
like poetry."&#xD;
Ina smiled.&#xD;
" That is the first time I have seen&#xD;
you smile, Miss Struhling, since you&#xD;
came ; it must have been, as mam-&#xD;
ma feared, that you yourself were&#xD;
very ill."&#xD;
Ina was silent. Dinner was an-&#xD;
nounced. Marcello was not at the&#xD;
table. The dinner passed off in&#xD;
great silence ; Madame Benoni re-&#xD;
quired  the   excitement  of some&#xD;
stranger to make her talk at all,&#xD;
Monsieur Benoni seemed to have&#xD;
something on his mind, and the chil-&#xD;
dren were told never to speak at&#xD;
meals unless spoken to. After din-&#xD;
ner they weht into the parlor to take&#xD;
their coffee. Ina was listening, with&#xD;
that terrible intensity which shuts&#xD;
out all other sounds, to hear if the&#xD;
door-bell would ring. She was wait-&#xD;
ing for Emanuele ; she looked around&#xD;
hopelessly, as she thought, " How&#xD;
shall I speak with him ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC8231-00000034"/>&#xD;
INA.                             65&#xD;
&#xD;
The hall door opened, but it was&#xD;
with a latch-key; Marcello entered.&#xD;
with Bertani. Emanuele gave a&#xD;
quick look at NIna; she felt it, al-&#xD;
though she did/not raise her eyes.&#xD;
Marcello came near the table where&#xD;
she sat, and took a chair by her side.&#xD;
"I regretted," he said, "not being&#xD;
able to get home to dine with you&#xD;
at your first dinner in our house&#xD;
after so long a time."   Monsieur&#xD;
Benoni was talking with Emanuele,&#xD;
and Madame Benoni was as usual re-&#xD;
clining on her sofa, listening to them.&#xD;
"Thank you," said Ina, scarcely&#xD;
heeding what he said. She felt that&#xD;
Emanuele's eyes were on her, al-&#xD;
though he was apparently discussing&#xD;
politics with much interest with&#xD;
Monsieur Benoni.&#xD;
"You look ill," said Marcello ; " I&#xD;
am afraid you have suffered- from&#xD;
nursing your brother."&#xD;
Ina did not answer.&#xD;
"Your brother lives in Zurich,&#xD;
does he- not ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Ina, without looking&#xD;
at him.&#xD;
"Then it was at Zurich that you&#xD;
were with him ?"&#xD;
" Yes," said Ina, coloring painfully.&#xD;
"My dear Miss Strdhling, you are&#xD;
not well," he said, lowering his voice.&#xD;
"I trust you will not begin your&#xD;
lessons immediately with my sis-&#xD;
ters ; do rest. My mother has a&#xD;
kind heart, although sometimes the&#xD;
says things which might lead you to&#xD;
- i   believe otherwise. I entreat you not&#xD;
to sacrifice your health; I wish I&#xD;
knew of anything I .could do for&#xD;
ytou !"&#xD;
mna thought that the only remedy&#xD;
was to be with him who sat opposite&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
them, looking'at her under his hand,&#xD;
with which he had shaded his eyes,&#xD;
and to hear him  say passionately s&#xD;
he once did, " I love you, Ina!" but&#xD;
she said ,only, " Thank you, you are&#xD;
very good."&#xD;
"Good or bad," he said, smiling,&#xD;
"I think any one's heart would be&#xD;
touched by seeing you look so mis.&#xD;
erable."&#xD;
"Miss   Strdhling," said Bertani,&#xD;
"did   you  have a very fatiguing&#xD;
journey ? You really look ill."&#xD;
"That is just what I was saying&#xD;
to her," said Marcello.&#xD;
"You are neither of you very flat-&#xD;
tering," said Ina, faintly smiling; "I&#xD;
know of no harder way to enter a&#xD;
lady's good graces than by disprais-&#xD;
ing her to her face."&#xD;
"It is a proof," said Emanele,&#xD;
"that we think her above flattery!"&#xD;
"She is certainly not like our&#xD;
friend Madame de Turenne," said&#xD;
Marcello.&#xD;
"You are unfair," said Bertani,&#xD;
"towards that fair lady; if you had&#xD;
ever had one glance from those&#xD;
Ethiop eyes, you would not dare to&#xD;
speak thus."&#xD;
" Meaning that others have," said&#xD;
Marcello, laughing, and making a&#xD;
polite inclination towards Monsieur&#xD;
Bertani,           -&#xD;
"You wish to revenge yourself on&#xD;
Rome like Coriolanus, because Rome&#xD;
does not see your virtues," said&#xD;
Bertani.&#xD;
"I am certainly like him in not&#xD;
wishing to show my scars."&#xD;
" The De Turenne scar would be a&#xD;
deep' one," said Bertani. " I should&#xD;
not want to be wounded by those&#xD;
eyes."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes; over her door is written&#xD;
'Lasciate ogni speranza voi che en-&#xD;
trate,"* said Marcello.&#xD;
na rose, and stood by the mantel-&#xD;
piece, as if she had drawn nearer the&#xD;
fire to warm herself. Bertani rose,&#xD;
and said, " With your leave, I will go&#xD;
into the library. I want to look out&#xD;
Lady Hamilton's life; there is some-&#xD;
thing in, the lady we speak of and&#xD;
in Nelson's seductress that seems to&#xD;
me to bear a     resemblance.   She&#xD;
looks like a portrait I once saw of&#xD;
that great enchantress ! "&#xD;
" Do," said Madame Benoni to Ina,&#xD;
"ring the bell for me, my dear, in&#xD;
the next room; this' one is broken.&#xD;
I must confess I know of nothing&#xD;
more trying to the nerves than to&#xD;
pull a bell that does not make any&#xD;
sound; it is really distressing, but I&#xD;
have found that no appeals, either to&#xD;
my son or to his father, have any&#xD;
effect upon them."&#xD;
Ina went into the next room;&#xD;
there stood Bertani, his back turned&#xD;
to the door by which she had en-&#xD;
tered. He was sitting, his cigar in&#xD;
one hand, and turning over the pages&#xD;
of a biographies gintrale.  She went&#xD;
quickly over to him; he started&#xD;
slightly.&#xD;
"Why are you here ?",he said.&#xD;
"For God's sake," she said, in an&#xD;
under voice of suppressed agony, "if&#xD;
you have any mercy in your soul,&#xD;
speak to me, tell me that you love&#xD;
me !"&#xD;
"Will they not notice your ab-&#xD;
sence ?"&#xD;
"No," she said, quickly; ;"Madame&#xD;
Benoni sent me to ring the bell; the&#xD;
door-bell outside rang twice, and&#xD;
* "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."&#xD;
&#xD;
the servant did not attend to it;&#xD;
some. one will be coming in, they&#xD;
will not miss us. Do you not see&#xD;
that you are killing me ? Ah, I shall&#xD;
die if you do not destroy this wall&#xD;
between us)  Tell me you love me."&#xD;
"I love you passionately," he&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"It is false !" said Ina; "it is I&#xD;
who love you so," and her eyes&#xD;
flashed like her brother's. If he had&#xD;
seen her now, he would have thought&#xD;
that she knew how to vindicate her&#xD;
own rights !&#xD;
Emanuele looked at her with ad-&#xD;
miration. She saw the light of old&#xD;
in his eyes, and she took 'new hope&#xD;
from it.&#xD;
"You are fretting for the child,"&#xD;
he said; "your heart is divided&#xD;
now.&#xD;
"It is false," she said again, "and&#xD;
you know it ! I love him, yes, better&#xD;
than life; but I have loved you bet-&#xD;
ter than my own honor, - better,&#xD;
then, than him."&#xD;
Some company had entered the&#xD;
parlor; they heard voices talking,&#xD;
they felt that they were' safe from&#xD;
interruption.&#xD;
He drew her to him, and kissed her&#xD;
passionately; then she lay again, as&#xD;
of old, tightly enclosed in his strong&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
" Listen," she said ; " for God's&#xD;
sake, do not be angry with me, but&#xD;
- I have seen my brother!"&#xD;
"Where ?". he said, loosening his&#xD;
hold on her, his face flushing.&#xD;
"At my cottageI!" she said, "and&#xD;
he thought I was dishonored. Ah,&#xD;
Emanuele, I have let my beloved&#xD;
little Sofi think ill of me, but my&#xD;
brother ! my mother in dying left&#xD;

my promise; I epd not break his&#xD;
heart. If it had been to right my-&#xD;
self, I would not have spoken, but it&#xD;
was too terrible to see him standing&#xD;
there, so bowed with grief !"&#xD;
"And he knows all?" he said,.al-&#xD;
most glaring at poor Ina.&#xD;
"No, no, not your name, - by all&#xD;
that is sacred to' you, Emanuele, do&#xD;
not look at me so ! Ah, he does not&#xD;
dream who you are, I fear not for&#xD;
that; but he said that if the man I&#xD;
loved did not give me his name' be-&#xD;

0, I wish," she said, with infinite&#xD;
dreariness in her voice, "that he&#xD;
would kill me!",&#xD;
Emanuele laughed a hollow laugh,&#xD;
and said: "I fear not for my life, I&#xD;
fear not a ooward who strikes in the&#xD;
dark; but how could 'you, Ina, so&#xD;
break your word ?"&#xD;
"It was better than to keep . it&#xD;
thus," she said, in sullen despair.&#xD;
"And do you mean henceforward&#xD;
to keep ,your word, or do you mean&#xD;
to break it ? for I must know be-&#xD;
forehand."&#xD;
"0," she said, wringing her hands,&#xD;
"you know I mean' to keep my word ;&#xD;
but tell me," she said, growing sud-&#xD;
denly calm, and folding her arms,&#xD;
"do you never mean to give me&#xD;
openly your name?"&#xD;
"I will speak to you of that an-&#xD;
other time," he said; "now you are&#xD;
too much excited, you are not your-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"Bertani,' said Marcello, entering&#xD;
hastily, "have you found Lady&#xD;
Hamilton's likeness ? for here is&#xD;
Gualterio, who, strange to say, finds&#xD;
the same resemblance that you do."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, here. it is ; I will show it&#xD;
him, .it is very like. Mademoiselle&#xD;
Strdhling and I have been looking&#xD;
over these portraits together."' And&#xD;
Bertani left the room.&#xD;
"Will you," said Ina, looking up&#xD;
at Marcello, - "will you. tell your&#xD;
mother that I could not sit up? I&#xD;
will not go back into the parlor; I&#xD;
really have such, a dreadful pain in&#xD;
my head." She moved a step, and&#xD;
staggered.&#xD;
."Lean  on me," he said, gently.&#xD;
"Poor thing !" looking    down' ten.&#xD;
derly at her. "I swear that if I&#xD;
thought my best friend ,had done&#xD;
you an injury, I would kill him in&#xD;
cold blood. Do not shrink from me;&#xD;
I know that you do not love me, --&#xD;
it matters not,-but I have loved&#xD;
you from the first. Ah, Miss Str1hbl-&#xD;
ing, a lover's eyes are more pene-&#xD;
trating than those of the rest of the&#xD;
world.   I, would have spoken long&#xD;
since, but I saw it would come too&#xD;
late;' but believe me, if you need&#xD;
help, a loyal friend, a brother, with&#xD;
more than a brother's care for you,&#xD;
fear not, to come to me ; my life&#xD;
shall be at your disposal. I cannot&#xD;
say more."&#xD;
"No one can help me," said Ia.&#xD;
" You do not know," he said, lead-&#xD;
ing her to the door. "Good night,&#xD;
God bless and protect you."&#xD;
Ina loolped up into his face with&#xD;
gratitude; she could not speak, but&#xD;
she felt less lonely for his kindness.&#xD;
She listened to the voices down&#xD;
stairs until she heard the door open&#xD;
She went to the window. Bertani&#xD;
passed out of the dark porch below;&#xD;
she could have spoken to him with-&#xD;
out danger, but she did not wish to.&#xD;

and disappeared from Ida's straining&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
NA received every day a letter&#xD;
dictated by Sofi and written by&#xD;
Gabriele ; there it was always at her&#xD;
plate when she went down to break-&#xD;
fast. It was her only ray of sun-&#xD;
shine all the day.  Sofi told her that&#xD;
the baby was well, that he had be-&#xD;
gun to look at his hands, that he&#xD;
had fixed his eyes on Ina's photo-&#xD;
graph when Sofi had handed it to&#xD;
him, -she was not sure whether he&#xD;
knew it was his mother or not, -&#xD;
that she longed for her mistress&#xD;
more than for anything in life ; and&#xD;
she asked her when .they should&#xD;
come and be together once more.&#xD;
"Have you friends    in Lucerne,&#xD;
and such warm   ones?" said Mar-&#xD;
'cello one day to her, as she put her&#xD;
letter in her pocket at the breakfast-&#xD;
table. She always liked to read it&#xD;
when alone, all alone in her room.&#xD;
"Yes," said Ina, coloring deeply,&#xD;
then growing  pale, and    coloring&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"I would not - have asked you&#xD;
such a question, had I thought to&#xD;
distress you, believe me. I do not&#xD;
know how it is possible for me to&#xD;
give so much pain, when I may&#xD;
truly say I would rather suffer most&#xD;
acutely niyself than inflict suffering&#xD;
on you."&#xD;
"I do not know," said Ina, thought-&#xD;
fully, "why you would be so gen-&#xD;
erotis to me ; mental pain is so ter-&#xD;
rible to bear !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"From the most selfish of princi-&#xD;
ples," he answered, quietly; "I&#xD;
thought that I had told you the&#xD;
other evening that I love you."&#xD;
" Then it is true?" said Ina, look-&#xD;
ing up in his face deprecatingly, as&#xD;
if she longed to have hm deny it.&#xD;
" It is true, Miss Strohling ; I re-&#xD;
gret myself that it is so."&#xD;
" Then I must go," said Ina, with&#xD;
deep anguish- in her tones ; then&#xD;
with sudden energy, she said, "You&#xD;
must not love me, Monsieur Mar-&#xD;
cello ! you must not think of me at&#xD;
all! It is dreadful," she said, turning&#xD;
very pale, "even to speak of such&#xD;
a thing; you do not know what it&#xD;
would be to love me; you would&#xD;
never be, happy. again in your life&#xD;
if you did !"&#xD;
"I cannot see anything so dreadful&#xD;
in it, Miss Strohing," he said, smil-&#xD;
ing.  "Every  one must take the&#xD;
consequences of his own actions. I&#xD;
accept mine. I have my pride, Miss&#xD;
Str6hling,* like another man. You&#xD;
know I passed most of my youth in&#xD;
England. My mother is half Eng-&#xD;
lish herself, and therefore, when I&#xD;
spoke, I did not mean love in the&#xD;
Italian sense, made ip of declara-&#xD;
tions of death and despair. I did&#xD;
not intend that you should imagine&#xD;
I would kill myself for you; it&#xD;
would be better, I think, to live and&#xD;
watch over your interests. I told&#xD;
you once that. I knew I had come&#xD;
too late, and I abide by that decision&#xD;
which destiny has thought to be for&#xD;
my good; for I believe that nothing&#xD;
is that is not best for us in the end,&#xD;
however unhappy that fate may be.&#xD;
I cannot bear to hear a man speak-&#xD;
ing of his disappointments and sor-&#xD;

rows; he must battle with them&#xD;
not succumb to them. Have pa-&#xD;
tience with me yet for one moment&#xD;
When I said I loved you, I meant&#xD;
merely that which is unalterable in&#xD;
my heart ; it is a feeling without&#xD;
desire, without hope, of entire de-&#xD;
votion to the object loved. I shall&#xD;
never, believe me, offend you again&#xD;
by the use of the word, but allow&#xD;
me to say that I shall feel the same;&#xD;
yes, even though I should know you&#xD;
to be another's man's wife, even&#xD;
though years , should elapse, and&#xD;
though I might never again see you.&#xD;
Call it friendship if you choose, but&#xD;
it is stronger than common friend-&#xD;
ship, and that is scarcely, I think,&#xD;
the name for it."&#xD;
"Would it not be wrong, then, for&#xD;
me to remainhere? " said Ina.  "It&#xD;
would be a consolation to me, to&#xD;
think so ; you speak so differently&#xD;
from any other maifnthat-"&#xD;
" Because,", he said, " most men do&#xD;
not stop to weigh what they say;&#xD;
they~ forget everything in the one&#xD;
desire of possession at the moment ;&#xD;
they must have, at all hazards of life&#xD;
or death, what they wish, and then&#xD;
what is obtained in ,such hot haste&#xD;
is repented of as surely, and almost&#xD;
as quickly."&#xD;
Ina heaved a heavy sigh.&#xD;
"Promise me," he said, "that my&#xD;
presence here shall never influence&#xD;
you, in any way, in a decision to&#xD;
leave this house; it is little for you&#xD;
to grant to me who would have&#xD;
asked so much."&#xD;
" I promise you," said Ina, " and I&#xD;
feel deeply grateful to. you, only I&#xD;
know not how to express it in words."&#xD;
" I do not wish gratitude," he an-&#xD;
&#xD;
, swered, "only that you will have&#xD;
- confidence in me, and remember&#xD;
that my services are ever at your&#xD;
t command."&#xD;
" Miss Str5hling, Miss Strohling,&#xD;
t do call papa ! Mamma says she has&#xD;
such an access."&#xD;
- Ina went quickly, and told Mon-&#xD;
sieur Benoni, who was in the library,&#xD;
that his wife was not well. The&#xD;
good gentleman smiled     under his&#xD;
spectacles, and said: " I will go lpres.&#xD;
ently, Miss Strohling ; I doubt if her&#xD;
disease cannot wait a moment."&#xD;
Monsieur Benoni found his wife&#xD;
in her usual attitude of graceful re-&#xD;
pose, but her face had in it nothing&#xD;
of the rest of her body. He knew&#xD;
that a storm was brewing, and he&#xD;
prepared himself to meet it.&#xD;
" And how is my darling," he said,&#xD;
" this morning ?"&#xD;
" Monsieur Benoni, it is not now&#xD;
the time for soft words. I firmly&#xD;
believe you would all leave me here&#xD;
to die; every one save my family&#xD;
feels for my broken constitution, for&#xD;
my poor frail body ; but from those&#xD;
around me I have ever met .with the&#xD;
most heartless indifference."&#xD;
"Why, my dear treasure, you are&#xD;
not  certainly  well  to-day ; your&#xD;
nerves are really affected, my love."&#xD;
"They are affected, sadly.so," she&#xD;
said, "but at least they leave me&#xD;
with mf sight clear ; yes, thank&#xD;
Heaven, I .am not blindfold in my'&#xD;
own house; I must confesgI can see!"&#xD;
"And few people, my dear, have'&#xD;
such lovely eyes to see with."&#xD;
Madame Beiioni turned away her,&#xD;
face to hide the flush of satisfaction&#xD;
that her husband's remark called&#xD;
up, and then said: "-0 my dear,&#xD;
&#xD;
nobody knows what I suffer ; I own,&#xD;
openly, that my heart is breaking.&#xD;
I had thought that, when I was con-&#xD;
fined to my room,-some one would&#xD;
have the delicacy -yes, I must use&#xD;
that word, although I regret that I am&#xD;
forced to do so - to see that things&#xD;
went on with equal propriety as if&#xD;
I were myself present. Ah, Mon-&#xD;
sieur I3enoni, I never was made for&#xD;
your laisser aller Italian natures.&#xD;
When you are young, it is all inten-&#xD;
sity; when old, all indifference. I&#xD;
am glad, at least, that Marcello has&#xD;
some of my blood in his veins, al-&#xD;
though his conduct of late has little&#xD;
in it on which my eye can rest with&#xD;
pride."&#xD;
"Why, my dear, what has Mar-&#xD;
cello done ? " said her husband, rais-&#xD;
ing his spectacles, and looking rather&#xD;
quizzically under them.  " I hope he&#xD;
has not been making love to the&#xD;
maid!"&#xD;
"There are certain things, Mon-&#xD;
sieur Benoni, so entirely repulsive to&#xD;
one's nature, that any one with even&#xD;
the slightest shadow of susceptibility&#xD;
to those more delicate feelings would&#xD;
he influenced by them, but it is with&#xD;
exquisite pain that I see you so de-&#xD;
void of this sensibility ; however, I&#xD;
will not notice your remark. I will&#xD;
leave it as if unsaid. I will not&#xD;
dwell upon it, as it would be 'too&#xD;
painful to my more refined manner&#xD;
of considering certain subjects. It&#xD;
is true that I was brought up in&#xD;
Italy, and that my father was an&#xD;
Italian; but from my mother, I must&#xD;
confess I am glad to say, I inherited&#xD;
all my happy prejudices in extreme&#xD;
-youth."&#xD;
"Well, my dear, I am glad too,&#xD;
&#xD;
and that that youth has not passed&#xD;
as yet !"&#xD;
"Your flattery falls on me un-&#xD;
heeded, Monsieur Benoni; indeed, I&#xD;
may say it is utterly distasteful to&#xD;
me. All I ask is --and I must&#xD;
confess it does not seem to me that&#xD;
I am requesting too much from. a&#xD;
husband, when I say that I should&#xD;
have wished a slight surveillance in&#xD;
this house;- something for others&#xD;
that you would have wished for your&#xD;
own girls, if it is only putting it on&#xD;
the ground of doing unto others as&#xD;
you would be done unto."&#xD;
"My love, will you favor me with&#xD;
an instantaneous explanation of the&#xD;
terrible vengeance that seems to be&#xD;
hanging over this house like a colos-&#xD;
sal sword of Damocles ?"&#xD;
"Your style is, as usual, exagger-&#xD;
ated, Monsieur Benoni; but is it&#xD;
possible that you have not seen that&#xD;
Miss Strihling is doing her best, I&#xD;
may say her very best, to ensnare&#xD;
our son? that all her faculties are&#xD;
bent, since her return, upon this sole&#xD;
object ? Not that I fear for him, still&#xD;
I do not wish this thing to continue;&#xD;
the bare thought of it has so affected&#xD;
my bead that I feel as if brain fever&#xD;
might set in at any moment."&#xD;
"My dear child, allow me to say&#xD;
that I have noticed nothing of the&#xD;
kind, and, even if I had I should&#xD;
not interfere with the course of&#xD;
events in any way. I think nothing&#xD;
better could happen to Marcello&#xD;
than to find a good wife, and surely&#xD;
he could not easily find one more&#xD;
attractive, better educategwyith more&#xD;
true refinement than Mademoiselle&#xD;
Str~hling. Money he does not need&#xD;
to look for,-he has sufficient; it is&#xD;

at any rate will not be agreeable, but of a woman beneath you in position,&#xD;
I will, if possible, prevent its being -of one of such very low birth, --&#xD;
positively intolerable," and so he this I did not expect ! I hate even&#xD;

that she was the realization of his for I know, of course, that it would&#xD;

in. society was, when speaking of her  " Madam," said Marcello, folding&#xD;

cello to me." It was not long before it falls completely on my nerves."&#xD;
Marcello knocked at his mother's      " But," he said, not apparently no-&#xD;

pother is dead, then you will begin she being the only person, I believe,&#xD;
to regret her.. -You are my only ,who at present holds that position in&#xD;
&#xD;
your house. I had fallen as com-&#xD;
pletely in love with Miss Strohling&#xD;
as it is possible, I suppose, for a man&#xD;
to be with .a woman. Miss Strihl-&#xD;
ing rejected all my advances, merely&#xD;
because she did not love me,.- mark&#xD;
the simple fact,-not in the least&#xD;
because my position was higher than&#xD;
hers. ,I do not intend dying of a&#xD;
broken heart, but I do mean to re-&#xD;
main her faithful friend through&#xD;
everything, and," lie said,- looking&#xD;
his mother. firmly in the face, "if&#xD;
you should in any way make this&#xD;
house disagreeable to Mademoiselle&#xD;
Strolling, so  that she  should  be&#xD;
forced to leave' it, you will lose at&#xD;
the same time, as an inmate of your&#xD;
household, your son. Have you any-&#xD;
thing else, Madame, to say to me? I&#xD;
am at your command."&#xD;
"Nothing," she said, "save that I&#xD;
hope you enjoyed digging my grave&#xD;
with your own filial hands !"&#xD;
Marcello was the only person in&#xD;
the world who knew  how to govern&#xD;
his mother ; she was proud of him&#xD;
because he was fine-looking, clever,&#xD;
and gentlemanly, but she had very&#xD;
little companinship with him, and&#xD;
her nervous 4cesses, as she called&#xD;
them, were ways slighted if he&#xD;
happened to be present.  She was a&#xD;
little afraid of him, -afraid of his&#xD;
ridicule and his keen satire. Mar-&#xD;
cello bowed and left the room with-&#xD;
out answering her.&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
"(NE of these cards is'for you,&#xD;
M Mademoiselle Str~ihling," said&#xD;
lMarcello, who had taken from the&#xD;
&#xD;
silver waiter several notes that the&#xD;
-servant had handed him. "I know&#xD;
the fair hand, I think, that penned&#xD;
it ; and :here is one for me!"&#xD;
Ina opened it. "It is an invita-&#xD;
tion for a dinner next week, on Fri-&#xD;
day, at Madame de Turenne's," she&#xD;
said.&#xD;
" You willgo, I hope ? " said Mon-&#xD;
sieur Bertani, who was looking fix-&#xD;
edly at Ina. "I received my invi-&#xD;
tation yesterday."&#xD;
"Which means that you think&#xD;
ours were sent as a second thought,"&#xD;
said Marcello.&#xD;
"Not at all; it merely means that&#xD;
I hoped you were asked, and feared&#xD;
you were not, because you had not&#xD;
mentioned it, and dared not put the&#xD;
question for fear of giving myself&#xD;
too great a disappointment. Shall&#xD;
you go, Mademoiselle Strohling 2"&#xD;
"Yes," said Ina, returning his gaze.&#xD;
"iDo you not think, Mademoiselle&#xD;
Strhling," said Marcello, " that Ber-&#xD;
tani is rather like the gogl Jupiter,&#xD;
afraid sometimes of showing his fire,&#xD;
lest it should burn up those he most&#xD;
loves in its flames? That is the rea-&#xD;
son, I suppose, that he has given us,&#xD;
his best friends, so little of it of late."&#xD;
"Why, what do you mean, Mar-&#xD;
cello ?"&#xD;
"I mean that you are not your-&#xD;
self, that you have not been yourself&#xD;
for the last month."&#xD;
" And who, pray, is my Semele ?"&#xD;
"Not Madame de Turenne surely;&#xD;
she would stand any amount of heat."&#xD;
"I shall become her champion if&#xD;
you run her down."&#xD;
"She would make a perfect Kuni-&#xD;
gunda, Bertani. Pardon me, I think&#xD;
mny mother called."&#xD;

72                                INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was the first time that Bertani&#xD;
had been left alone with Ina since&#xD;
she came, save that short interview&#xD;
in the library the first evening of&#xD;
her arrival. The young girls had&#xD;
retired for the night, Monsieur Be-&#xD;
noni had gone to his club, and&#xD;
Madame Benoni had sent word that&#xD;
she should not receive that evening.&#xD;
Bertani had been there every day&#xD;
after dinner, since Ina came from&#xD;
Lucerne ; his hour was generally&#xD;
from -eight to nine, but the parlor&#xD;
was always full, and Ina and he&#xD;
rarely spoke together, save for a mo-&#xD;
ment,. when every eye might be-&#xD;
upon them. Ina sat motionless ;&#xD;
she did not spring to Bertani's side&#xD;
as she would have done .a month&#xD;
ago.; she felt as if she were rooted&#xD;
to- the spot, and her eyes fastened&#xD;
down by leaden weights.&#xD;
" Ina,', he said, "you are sadly&#xD;
changed ; you look like the pale&#xD;
shadow of her I once wooed. Do you,&#xD;
think Marcello suspects anything?"&#xD;
" I have never thought about it at&#xD;
all."a&#xD;
"Ina, you do, not .love me any&#xD;
more. It is three weeks since I&#xD;
have watched for one look of love&#xD;
from. your eyes."&#xD;
"Do you think," she said, "that&#xD;
love is always at your command ?,&#xD;
that it is like an Eastern slave, to&#xD;
come at your slightest beck? Do&#xD;
you ask a harp, after you have taken&#xD;
away all its strings, why it does' not&#xD;
give forth the music it uttered be-&#xD;
fore ? Do yot cut away the wings of&#xD;
a bird, and say, Why does it not soar&#xD;
through. the air for my amusement&#xD;
as it once did ? Can you lIeave a&#xD;
flower without the suiilight to warm&#xD;
&#xD;
it, or water to refresh it, and expect&#xD;
to find it vivid in color, and filling&#xD;
the air with its fragrance.? This is&#xD;
what you have done to me ! There is&#xD;
no more music in my heart, no more&#xD;
swift-winged flight through a world&#xD;
of illusions, no more basking in the&#xD;
warm sun."&#xD;
"You are bitter."&#xD;
I am what you have made ine,"&#xD;
Bertani's heart was touched. There&#xD;
was indeed no more life in Ina's face;&#xD;
all those varied emotions that once&#xD;
played over it like light on the prism&#xD;
were gone ; her voice was no longer&#xD;
the gay echo of a glad soul, it was&#xD;
hushed, and seemed to touch only&#xD;
one sad chord.&#xD;
"I am," she said, after a few min-&#xD;
utes' pause, "the Semele who have&#xD;
been scathed and burnt to my soul,&#xD;
not by a great fire that would have&#xD;
flashed light into my eyes,- but&#xD;
parched and shrivelled away by a&#xD;
burning fever. You were the god&#xD;
that humbled yourself to come to&#xD;
one so low ; you descended from your&#xD;
heaven of ambition, and filled me&#xD;
with 'immortal longings,' and then&#xD;
left me to live in the dust as I&#xD;
might."&#xD;
" Ina, have you forgotten that we&#xD;
have a bond to bind us which can-&#xD;
not be snapped ? Is there not a bright.&#xD;
bud on your leafless plant that shall'&#xD;
yet bloom for us both ? "    '&#xD;
" What is our child to us ?" she&#xD;
said.; "far away from us both, as yet&#xD;
he has no mother or father! 0 0Eman-&#xD;
uele," she said, suddenly rising and'&#xD;
standing before him, " give me your&#xD;
name, not for me, not for myself,--&#xD;
I have almost grown not to care for&#xD;
myself, - but for him ; he is so&#xD;
&#xD;
sweet, and if you could see him smil-&#xD;
ing in his innocent sleep -"  She&#xD;
clasped her hands before her, and&#xD;
stood, her eyes filling with tears,&#xD;
looking so lovely in her helplessness&#xD;
that Bertani felt how he had wronged&#xD;
her; a genuine feeling of remorse,&#xD;
love, and pity swept over him, and,&#xD;
he knelt down before her.&#xD;
"Ina," he said, "-all shall be right,&#xD;
all shall be well. I will forget my&#xD;
country, my dreams of ambition, all&#xD;
for you; only say that you forgive&#xD;
and forget the past."&#xD;
There was no answer from Ina,&#xD;
only a low suppressed sob.&#xD;
"Ina, you will break my heart if&#xD;
you do not speak. I never knelt to&#xD;
any woman before, - will you let&#xD;
me rise without one word of love&#xD;
from your lips ?  Speak to me then&#xD;
for our child's sake ! Ina, I. love&#xD;
you! The clouds shall vanish from&#xD;
your young life. I will take you ge-&#xD;
fore all the world as my wife, and if&#xD;
there be any blame attached to what&#xD;
has been, I will accept it as mine."&#xD;
"0 Emanuele, do I hear you truly&#xD;
say those words ? I cannot yet be-&#xD;
lieve my own happiness," she said,&#xD;
as she sank into his arms. " I have&#xD;
suffered so much that I cannot wake&#xD;
from it ; my soul seems almost stub-&#xD;
born. I do not know how it all was,&#xD;
but in those days of silence and .lone-&#xD;
liness, when I thought I never should&#xD;
again see you alone, every evening&#xD;
when you had gone such dull despair&#xD;
crept over me that I could not even&#xD;
weep. I could not believe yon were&#xD;
the same who had sat at my feet,&#xD;
who had covered me with flowers, on&#xD;
whose shoulder my h.ead had so often&#xD;
laigr! Ah, I thought I should go mad!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"And now, dearest, will you smile&#xD;
again ? ". kissing her on her eyes and&#xD;
lips.&#xD;
" Yes," she said, looking up at him&#xD;
with a radiant smile breaking all&#xD;
over her face. "Is it possible that&#xD;
one breath of happiness can so anni-&#xD;
hilate the past ? It is too sudden,&#xD;
too much," she said, covering her face&#xD;
with her hands.&#xD;
Emanuele kissed her- hands; he&#xD;
spolge to her as of old ; he held her to&#xD;
him, looking in her eyes as if he&#xD;
could not weary of their depths.&#xD;
"Do you know," he said, looking&#xD;
at her, "that you make me feel Pyg-&#xD;
malion's rapture; it seems as if you&#xD;
were -just wakening into life. I see&#xD;
the roseate blood stealing over your&#xD;
hands and face, and the new life'&#xD;
stirring in every vein. Ah, Ina, you&#xD;
are beautiful thus ! I have never in&#xD;
my life desired so much to be an&#xD;
artist as when I have watched you&#xD;
in all your grace; and yet," he said,&#xD;
laughing, "I knew you were not&#xD;
beautiful, but there    was always&#xD;
something so nameless about you,&#xD;
that I could study you like a poem.&#xD;
I thought of you alternately as Iphi-&#xD;
genia, Electra, Romilda, Virginia, all&#xD;
that was noble, maidenly, and high;&#xD;
it was through my imagination that&#xD;
you addressed my senses. Ah, Ina,&#xD;
my own German love, more lovely in&#xD;
your mystic ideality than our wo-&#xD;
men in their impassioned reality, tell&#xD;
me that you forgive me, and that you&#xD;
will bloom again into life."&#xD;
Ina was too blessed to speak; he&#xD;
had indeed watered and sunned his&#xD;
flower, which had sprung into fra-&#xD;
grant blushes'agavin for him.&#xD;
" I used to think sometimes," she&#xD;
&#xD;
INA"                          73&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8231-00000039"/>&#xD;
74                              INA.'&#xD;
&#xD;
said, of those English lines I liked&#xD;
so much,--      ,-&#xD;
'Our cedars must fall around us&#xD;
Before we see the light';&#xD;
but I saw only the darkness when&#xD;
I thought mine had fallen around me.&#xD;
o Emanuele, it is so sweet to be&#xD;
happy, so fearful to suffer ! I do not&#xD;
think such pain does one good; mine&#xD;
only made me bitter and hard."&#xD;
"I trust it is past now, Ina, only&#xD;
that it may be my Ina of other days ;&#xD;
you know I cannot bear sorrow, my&#xD;
whole being   shrinks from  it.  I&#xD;
would not say, on bidding farewell to&#xD;
the \world, as Jupiter did, 'Niemand&#xD;
soll glicklich sein.' *  I would have&#xD;
every one glad. And now, my love,&#xD;
good night; rest well let your motto&#xD;
be, 'Courage et espdrance,' or rather&#xD;
take that of Charles the Fifth, 'J'at-&#xD;
tends mon astre'; have patience yet a&#xD;
little,and believe that all will be right."&#xD;
"0, I will," said Ina. " I cannot&#xD;
bear to have you go. Good night."&#xD;
Emanuele Bertani went away with,&#xD;
a freshly awakened love for Ina in&#xD;
his heart. His character was , a&#xD;
strange mixture of unruly elements,&#xD;
-extremely Epicurean, and without&#xD;
faith; with'a nature that was alive&#xD;
to all that was sensuous, enjoying&#xD;
t ie perfume of a flower, the- warm&#xD;
s nlight, or a woman's beauty, with&#xD;
a intensity which is rare; full of&#xD;
intellectual power, with 'a brain. that&#xD;
was capable of severe work seven-&#xD;
teei hours out of the twenty-four ;&#xD;
yet he was' not capable -of feeling&#xD;
any one thing long. Whether he&#xD;
had~a heart or no, it was difficult to&#xD;
tell; trouble, as he said, distressed&#xD;
him, because he believed' that this&#xD;
* "No one shall be happy,"&#xD;
&#xD;
world was meant for enjoyment. ;he&#xD;
felt all things with vivid keenness&#xD;
for the moment, then it was past.&#xD;
When 'he had seen Ina that evening,&#xD;
so lovely in her sorrow, his first im-&#xD;
pulse had been truly, as he said, to&#xD;
repair all the evil done ; but his&#xD;
ambition was his evil genius, and&#xD;
when he was not immediately under&#xD;
the influence of some peculiar charm,&#xD;
his good resolutions vanished as if&#xD;
they had never existed. He occupied&#xD;
a high position and did good to his&#xD;
country, still he did not labor for&#xD;
that, but for himself; and had he&#xD;
thought that his own path to dis.&#xD;
tinction would be just as well secured&#xD;
through unscrupulous actions, had&#xD;
they been more in harmony with&#xD;
his own private desires, he would&#xD;
not have hesitated to employ any&#xD;
means. Quick to feel 'sympathy,&#xD;
that sympathy must not cost him&#xD;
the  slightest  sacrifice.  Ina  had&#xD;
given him fresher, truer, deeper sen-&#xD;
sations than any other woman ever&#xD;
had; he had not grown weary of&#xD;
her, but she had ceased to be a nov-&#xD;
elty, and the interest had palled.&#xD;
When he conversed so interestingly&#xD;
of his country's progress, of the ne-&#xD;
cessity of her waking to a new life,&#xD;
of the demand for men of strength,&#xD;
honor, and action; when he spoke of&#xD;
the corrupting influence of priests,&#xD;
the false glamour of French litera-&#xD;
ture, the need of pure morals and a&#xD;
high standard, --he was earnest, elo-&#xD;
quent, and convincing.    It was not&#xD;
that he was deceiving others, he was&#xD;
only unconsciously deceiving him-&#xD;
self ; he felt what he said intellec-&#xD;
tually, not morally ; his expression&#xD;
was warm and fervid, and he thought&#xD;
&#xD;
at the time that he was the heroic&#xD;
advocate of all that was good and&#xD;
high; he forgot that in his soul, if&#xD;
he had one, he did not care at all&#xD;
about any of the arguments he was,&#xD;
so warmly pleading. He loved art,&#xD;
science, and learning, not for them-&#xD;
selves, but merely because the knowl-&#xD;
edge and appreciation of them gave&#xD;
him a sense of power in himself ;&#xD;
each step gained Was a height above&#xD;
the common herd, from which he&#xD;
could look down upon his fellow-&#xD;
men. He might have been great ;&#xD;
as it was, he was like a broken statue,&#xD;
like a grand-ship without a rudder,&#xD;
at the mercy of the waves of passion&#xD;
and selfish 'ambition.&#xD;
That evening when Ina went to&#xD;
her room, her poor heart was young&#xD;
again, the dead weight 'was gone&#xD;
frbiu it ; she knelt down and thanked&#xD;
God that Emanuele loved her ; she&#xD;
prayed that she might ever peep that&#xD;
love, and she felt strong in the sense&#xD;
of youth and hope. She wrote to&#xD;
Sofi, and poured out to her all her&#xD;
new happiness ; she sent thousands&#xD;
of kisses to her darling, and she&#xD;
knew that she was immeasurably&#xD;
blessed. The week passed quickly;&#xD;
she had not again had a chance to&#xD;
speak with her husband alone, but&#xD;
she had met his eye often, fixed on&#xD;
her, with the look of those first days&#xD;
in them when she first woke tremu-&#xD;
lously to life and'love. Once they had&#xD;
passed him in the street in the coach,&#xD;
and Ina had   seen, him   standing&#xD;
looking back until they were out of&#xD;
sight; once he had handed her a&#xD;
book before -Madanme Benoni, and as&#xD;
he did so, had hastily pressed her&#xD;
hand ; they were little things, but&#xD;
&#xD;
it is the food on which love feeds,&#xD;
and without which it dies, and Ina&#xD;
had carried them all in her heart, as&#xD;
a saint would sacred relics. They&#xD;
were enough for her to live on, aid&#xD;
she was willing to wait now, putting&#xD;
her trust in him, and feeling sure&#xD;
that it would not be long. And&#xD;
then she was to meet him at the&#xD;
dinner, and all her pulses beat to-&#xD;
wards that time ; he would perhaps&#xD;
speak with- her there, they should&#xD;
have some moments apart ; where&#xD;
there were to be so many persons,&#xD;
they would escape observation. Who&#xD;
knows but that, wandering on his&#xD;
arm, he would lead her to some room&#xD;
to see a certain picture, a.nd there,&#xD;
alone, he would speak words of love&#xD;
to her, and tell her when he would&#xD;
reveal their secret to Madame Be-&#xD;
noni, then to the world ; he would&#xD;
speak to her of their child, - and she&#xD;
stretched out her arms to it, as if to&#xD;
callit to come to her. Ina had ordered&#xD;
a plain white corded silk, at the&#xD;
suggestion. of Madame Benoni, whose&#xD;
fear of her son had made her very&#xD;
thoughtful of late in her manners to&#xD;
Ina; then'she was not bad-hearted,&#xD;
only completely' and selfishly ab-&#xD;
sorbed in her own petty complaints,&#xD;
and filled to ovrflowing with a happy&#xD;
vanity and self - complacency; she&#xD;
cared not much what others did, so&#xD;
that she herself was not disturbed,&#xD;
and the idea that Ina had refused&#xD;
her son,, instead of wounding her&#xD;
pride for him, had rather raised Ina&#xD;
in her estimation. She said to her&#xD;
often: " Mademoiselle Strbhling, you&#xD;
are a sensible young woman ; yes, I&#xD;
must confess that I have the highest&#xD;
respect, the truest esteem, for you;&#xD;
&#xD;
INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
7.5&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8231-00000040"/>&#xD;
INA.                          77&#xD;
&#xD;
you are one of thefew young women&#xD;
forwhom Iprofess to feel real respect."&#xD;
Ina did not know why Madame&#xD;
Benoni repeated these-words to her&#xD;
so frequently of late; she contented&#xD;
herself that she pleased her in any&#xD;
way. Ina's dress had come home,&#xD;
and she had tried it on; it was very&#xD;
simple, but elegant ; the neck was&#xD;
cut low, and filled up with tulle&#xD;
puffings. She was glad it was so&#xD;
pretty. Friday came, and with it two&#xD;
exquisite bunches of flowers, - one&#xD;
was from Bertani, she knew it, for it&#xD;
had just in the centre a white im-&#xD;
mortelle, the flower Ina used to wear&#xD;
in her breast in Switzerland, and&#xD;
there was, no name on the card ac-&#xD;
companying it; the other from Mar-&#xD;
cello, -and she was dressed by Ma-&#xD;
dame Benoni's own maid. She did'&#xD;
not wear any ornament save a row of&#xD;
pearls around her throat that Eman-&#xD;
uele had given her the day before&#xD;
she left Turin for her marriage. She&#xD;
had arranged her hair herself; it&#xD;
was simply brushed off her-face in&#xD;
great golden waves, and twisted&#xD;
around  her delicate-shaped  head,&#xD;
drooping a little in her throat. She&#xD;
looked so white, so graceful and&#xD;
evanescent, as she stood there, that&#xD;
she could not help feeling a slight&#xD;
flush of pleasure passing over her&#xD;
face as she looked at herself reflected&#xD;
in the large adrnoire a glace, and-&#xD;
thought that ,he would be, perhaps,&#xD;
proud to know that she was his.&#xD;
When she went into the parlor, she&#xD;
found Madame Benoni there with&#xD;
her son. Monsieur Marcello looked&#xD;
at her, and she ssaw ,the expression&#xD;
of admiration that filled his eyes as&#xD;
they rested on her; it gave her a-&#xD;
&#xD;
moment's pleasure. Madame Benoui,&#xD;
reclining in her black velvet on the&#xD;
sofa, that she might rest her shat.&#xD;
tered nerves even until the moment&#xD;
of departure, said with her more&#xD;
than usually languid tones: "Well,&#xD;
my dear,   must confess that you are&#xD;
looking rmarkably well. I never&#xD;
should dream that you were a gov-&#xD;
erness; should you, Marcello ?"&#xD;
"I think," he said, quietly, "that&#xD;
any sensation with regard to Mad-&#xD;
emoiselle Strihling would be that of&#xD;
a dream, for she seems to me too ,&#xD;
exquisitely shadowy to last."&#xD;
Ina blushed deeply.&#xD;
"My dear Marcello, allow me to&#xD;
say, as she who has given you birth&#xD;
has a right to remark, that your ob.&#xD;
servations are in bad taste. I think&#xD;
they would jar upon nerves much&#xD;
stronger than mine. Prose is the&#xD;
law of life ; it is its strength, and&#xD;
practicality is its staff. Poetry is all&#xD;
very well for Italian  lrovatores, but&#xD;
I must confess that I think it out&#xD;
of taste in a country that has noth-&#xD;
ing to do with the medievo.- Why&#xD;
do you not say simply, .' Mademoi-&#xD;
selle Strihling looks well' ? that&#xD;
would suffice."&#xD;
"Simply because, Madame, it would&#xD;
not in any way convey an idea of&#xD;
my feelings. I cannot say that Mad-&#xD;
emoisell   Strihling  looks  merely&#xD;
well, when I think she looks, as I&#xD;
said before, like a perfect dream of&#xD;
loveliness.".&#xD;
Ina 'looked distressed. Madame&#xD;
Benoni was just winding herself up&#xD;
for a long harangue, when fortunate-&#xD;
ly the carriage was announced.&#xD;
" Permit me," said Marcello, with&#xD;
a malicious smile, "to help you on&#xD;
&#xD;
with your cloak. If I may once&#xD;
touch you I shall feel more comfort-&#xD;
able, more certain that you will&#xD;
not suddenly escape like la belle&#xD;
Helne into air, leaving your gar-&#xD;
ments in the (ms of a despairing&#xD;
Faust behind you!"&#xD;
"This is 'too silly," said Madame&#xD;
Benoni; "this is, I must confess,&#xD;
foolish beyond my comprehension !"&#xD;
and she passed out in dignified dis-&#xD;
pleasure before her son.&#xD;
"I entreat you," said Ina, in a low&#xD;
voice, "if you value my peace of&#xD;
mind, not to irritate Madame Be-&#xD;
noni against me."&#xD;
"There is no danger," said, Mar-&#xD;
cello, laughing, and offering her his&#xD;
arm; but Ina drew back, and pointed&#xD;
hastily for him to go to his mother's&#xD;
side.&#xD;
"Your loving mother, Hamlet !"&#xD;
he said, and sprang, laughing, to his&#xD;
mother's side. Ina could not help&#xD;
smiling too, but she turned away her&#xD;
face to hide it, not, however, before&#xD;
Marcello had caught a glimpse of:&#xD;
the pretty curve around her lips.&#xD;
They soon arrived at Madame de&#xD;
Turenne's, were ushered up stairs to&#xD;
her room. Ina glanced around at it;&#xD;
a feeling of wondering curiosity&#xD;
came into -her mind as to whether&#xD;
Madame de Turenne, with all her&#xD;
brilliancy, her wealth, her adorers,&#xD;
was happy or no.  She thought she&#xD;
should like to look through her eyes,&#xD;
down into her heart.  It was strange,&#xD;
,but Ina felt a curious interest in&#xD;
everything in  this *chamber.  She&#xD;
looked at the bed, curtained with&#xD;
lace and amber satin damask, and&#xD;
thought to herself, " Has she ever&#xD;
Wept on those pillows ?" 'There was&#xD;
&#xD;
a fragrance of perfume in the roon,&#xD;
which was not strong, but just the&#xD;
most delicate souppon. There was a&#xD;
picture of Madame de Turenne over&#xD;
the luxuriously tufted sofa. ' It was&#xD;
taken so that it could expose as&#xD;
much as possible, without positive&#xD;
indecency, her beautiful form;, she&#xD;
was apparently en chemise, but this,&#xD;
her only article of clothing, was of&#xD;
the most transparent batiste. No&#xD;
trousseau from Paris could furnish&#xD;
forth a texture more exquisite in its&#xD;
subtle fineness. Her arms and neck&#xD;
were perfect; her hair was falling in&#xD;
quantities of, dark curls over her&#xD;
white shoulders; her face was hand-&#xD;
some, with dark, passionate eyes.&#xD;
Ina stood for a moment rapt in&#xD;
interest, gazing at this portrait; then&#xD;
she turned away with a sigh.' The&#xD;
room was filled with objets de godt,&#xD;
Cupids holding lights behind alabas-&#xD;
ter lamps. In the middle of the&#xD;
room there was a table with a tiny&#xD;
fountain in it; the water rose quite&#xD;
high, and splashed back, with a&#xD;
pretty rippling sound, over a lovely&#xD;
alabaster Venus, who was raising her&#xD;
hand as if to push away the waters&#xD;
and escape from them. On the&#xD;
toilet-table  there were  ring-cases&#xD;
dazzling with rings, and a diamond&#xD;
necklace thrown carelessly over the&#xD;
pincushion on which was- embroi-&#xD;
dered Madame de Turenne's mono-&#xD;
gram, as if she had meant to return&#xD;
and clasp it on her neck. From one&#xD;
side  of the room     the  windows&#xD;
opened into a conservatory full of the&#xD;
rarest flowers, and birds were flying&#xD;
amongst the plants in happy free-&#xD;
loin. Ina looked through the long&#xD;
glasses, and said to herself, " How&#xD;
&#xD;
76                          INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8231-00000041"/>&#xD;
78                             INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
lovely it looks! This isenchantment&#xD;
just what he would like; this is&#xD;
truly Armida's palace."&#xD;
"Are you ready," said   farcello,&#xD;
looking in at the door, " or are you&#xD;
too fascinated by this magic spell, as&#xD;
most of Madame de Turenne's ad-&#xD;
mirers are?"&#xD;
"Come, my dear,"' said Madame&#xD;
Benoni. "It is time to go into the&#xD;
salon."&#xD;
They passed through room after&#xD;
room; at last they heard the buzz of&#xD;
voices, and the waiter threw open the&#xD;
door, announcing them by name as&#xD;
they passed in. Madame de Turenne&#xD;
advanced graciously to meet them.&#xD;
She was dressed in a green satin&#xD;
trimmed with white'lace ; a diamond&#xD;
necklace with emeralds around her&#xD;
throat, a large bunch of scarlet gera-&#xD;
niums in her bosom, and a wreath&#xD;
of the same in her hair ; she looked&#xD;
magnificent. Ina's eyes were fixed&#xD;
on her. She thought of her picture&#xD;
upstairs, and wondered if Emanuele&#xD;
had ever seen it ; she hoped not.&#xD;
There were about twenty-five people&#xD;
present besides themselves. Bertani&#xD;
was standing near the mantel; he&#xD;
was talking with another gentleman.&#xD;
" Follow me, will you not, Madem-&#xD;
oiselle Strihling ? there is a seat near&#xD;
me ; and follow Mademoiselle Stroh-&#xD;
ling, Monsieur Marcello ! you could&#xD;
not be in the wake of more lovely&#xD;
foam than her white dress makes as&#xD;
she moves." And she took Ina's&#xD;
hand, and led her to the sofa. "Per-&#xD;
mit me, Madame Ia Contessa Gual-&#xD;
terio, Mademoiselle Str~hling. I have&#xD;
spoken to you of her, Nina ; this is&#xD;
my best friend, Mademoiselle ! I hope&#xD;
you will like each. other."&#xD;
&#xD;
The Countess said she was very&#xD;
glad to meet Ina, that she had often&#xD;
heard Madame de Turenne speak of&#xD;
her. "She has taken such a fancy&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
"She is very kind," said Ina.&#xD;
The Countess looked at Ina with&#xD;
interest, and said: "I do not won.&#xD;
der she has told me so much about&#xD;
you ;' you are such a striking contrast&#xD;
to all of us. I can understand why&#xD;
the Italian masters ran away from&#xD;
our dark hair to catch the golden&#xD;
light of those beautiful blondes."&#xD;
Just then, before Ina had time to&#xD;
reply, dinner was announced. Ma.&#xD;
dame de Turenne glided over to&#xD;
where B ertani was standing, and,&#xD;
taking his arm, said laughing, and in&#xD;
a low voice : " This is the advantage&#xD;
of having an entertainment in one's&#xD;
own house, one can choose one's&#xD;
knight; will you lead me in to din-&#xD;
ner ?"&#xD;
"I would follow you anywhere,"&#xD;
he answered; " but you will lead me&#xD;
where you choose." .&#xD;
" Into temptation ?" she said light-&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
"Into. Dante's own Inferno," he&#xD;
said, laughing, "which you would&#xD;
transform into a Paradise."&#xD;
"That would not be easy," she&#xD;
said. "Dante seems to take very&#xD;
little account of us women, and, with&#xD;
the exception of a few, to think it&#xD;
little matter where we are. I sup-&#xD;
pose that is the reason you quote&#xD;
him  so often."S&#xD;
They passed in to the dinner.&#xD;
Each person's name was placed in&#xD;
his plate, Ina sat lower down, be.-&#xD;
tween Marcello and another gentle-&#xD;
man whom she had never met before,.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I did not know," said Madame&#xD;
de Turenne, "whether it was best to&#xD;
let you each choose your seats, to&#xD;
leave it to chance, or to place you&#xD;
myself. I decided upon the last&#xD;
method, and all ladies who are not&#xD;
satisfied are at full liberty to chal-&#xD;
lenge e after dinner. As for the&#xD;
gentlemen, they naturally Will be&#xD;
perfectly happy in being honored by&#xD;
the presence of any of our lovely sex&#xD;
at their sides!"&#xD;
"Our first brindisi," said Bertani,&#xD;
"shall be for our beautiful hostess ;&#xD;
our next shall be to all those who&#xD;
come within her magic circle!"&#xD;
"You are too flattering," she said.&#xD;
"Flattery is merely truth when&#xD;
addressed to you!"&#xD;
"Flattery," she said, "is like the&#xD;
sparkling  bubbles in  champagne ;&#xD;
without it society would be dull and&#xD;
vapid indeed, as that would be with-c&#xD;
out its gas."&#xD;
"And how do you think we live&#xD;
without it," said Bertani, "since it&#xD;
is only a delicate flower that can be&#xD;
offered to women?"&#xD;
"You! Monsieur Bertani, do you1&#xD;
speak of yourself in the plural, as if &#xD;
you were royalty ? You drink it in in&#xD;
great intoxicating draughts every day I&#xD;
of your life ; you have it in theta&#xD;
Chamber,,in the Senate, in the King's&#xD;
palace, and," she said, lowering her&#xD;
eyes, and playing with the flowers inF&#xD;
her breast, "in women's eyes."      t&#xD;
"Would that I did !" said Bertani;s&#xD;
"that would be the sweetest of all." 1&#xD;
Madame de Turenne raised her&#xD;
eyes, and gave him a look, and then I&#xD;
cast them down again. -&#xD;
"oyou not think," she     said,&#xD;
"that Mademoiselle Ina is just like c&#xD;
&#xD;
a picture? I always try to make&#xD;
people happy. I cannot bear not to&#xD;
see people glad.' I am like you, Mon-&#xD;
sieur Bertani, I would like to live&#xD;
with my wings always spread out in&#xD;
the sunlight. I have fixed my heart&#xD;
upon a match between her and lMar-&#xD;
cello; he is such a charming fellowv!&#xD;
It is very generous," she said, with&#xD;
another side glance at Bertani, "for&#xD;
me to say so, for he utterly despises&#xD;
me; but I would be so glad if they&#xD;
could marry each other."&#xD;
"Do .you think he fancies her, - I&#xD;
mean, loves her ?"&#xD;
" 0 Monsieur Bertani," fixing her&#xD;
large eyes in wonder upon him, "can&#xD;
you not see plainer,-you who are&#xD;
always there, as Madame Benoni tells&#xD;
me, always ? She is happier than most&#xD;
women "; this was said with a little&#xD;
sigh.  "Do you not see that Mar-&#xD;
cello has no eyes save fir her? and&#xD;
indeed I do not wonder, for she is one&#xD;
of the sweetest-looking creatures I&#xD;
ever saw. I only wonder that others&#xD;
too are not, like Marcello, lost in her&#xD;
charms. Poor thing, how sad it is to&#xD;
be- a governess ! it is mere slavery.&#xD;
It must be dreadful to live in a house&#xD;
with Madame Benoni, to be under&#xD;
her rgine ! - I should go mad. And&#xD;
then, too, in the position of a depend-&#xD;
ant !"&#xD;
Emanuele winced. "You are gen-&#xD;
erous indeed," he said, "to give her&#xD;
the one man in the world that is'not&#xD;
at your feet ; only you ought first to&#xD;
have conquered him, then slain him&#xD;
with a look, and, when quite dead,&#xD;
have handed his corpse to Madem-.&#xD;
oiselle Strbhling."&#xD;
"You are cruel to me,"-..she said,&#xD;
~oloring deeply.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Are you quarrelling with Bertani ?"&#xD;
said Marcello, who had looked up&#xD;
and seen her angry color. "Beware !&#xD;
He is a dangerous enemy, and, I fear,&#xD;
a dangerous friend."&#xD;
"I was only trying," said Bertani,&#xD;
r'to convince Madame de Turenne&#xD;
that a little mercy was butjustice to&#xD;
her many victims."&#xD;
" Dois-je prendre un baton pour&#xD;
les mettre dehors ?" said Marcello.&#xD;
"Pour vous mettre dehors, oui,"&#xD;
said Madame de Turenne, laughing.&#xD;
"How lovely that little Cupid is !"&#xD;
said La Contessa Gualterio. "What is&#xD;
it doing ? " pointing to a sugar Cupid&#xD;
raised on a pyramid.&#xD;
"Raising his bow to aim full at the&#xD;
impenetrable heart !" said Marcello.&#xD;
"Which one ?" said the Countess,&#xD;
innocently.&#xD;
"You will, know by the first cry&#xD;
of pain you hear."&#xD;
Madame de Turenne was watching&#xD;
Emanuele. He felt her eyes, and&#xD;
turned suddenly ; she lowered hers&#xD;
and colored.&#xD;
She broke out a rose from the&#xD;
bunch of flowers which was in a glass&#xD;
near her, and silently placed it by-&#xD;
his plate ; he took it up, as -if he&#xD;
had not noticed that she had placed&#xD;
it  there, and put it in his pocket,&#xD;
just over his heart.&#xD;
"The King asked me,/the other day&#xD;
why I did not have roses always&#xD;
about my person. I told him in win-&#xD;
ter they would not bloom at my com-&#xD;
mand, because I was not a queen. He&#xD;
said he would furnish me, from his&#xD;
own green-house ; is that an equivo-&#xD;
cal compliment ?" she said, looking&#xD;
up at Bertani...&#xD;
" To such a beautiful woman as&#xD;
&#xD;
INA.                           81&#xD;
&#xD;
you are, I should think it certainly&#xD;
was."&#xD;
"Fi done !" with a quick glance&#xD;
up at him, and then down at her&#xD;
flowers.&#xD;
"Every woman says she despises&#xD;
the King, but in her heart she is&#xD;
proud to receive his attentions," said&#xD;
Bertani; "he is the central point of&#xD;
the nation, he represents the country,&#xD;
he is an idea around which the peo.&#xD;
ple rally, his name is an inspiration,&#xD;
an illusion, if you will, but it ex.&#xD;
ists, and women are not insensible to&#xD;
those influences."&#xD;
"The King must be honored," said&#xD;
the Count Gualterio, who had caught&#xD;
Bertani's last words, "the man dis-&#xD;
appears ; it is with him as it is with&#xD;
the Pope, the office veils the person,&#xD;
it is the divine right; if we do not&#xD;
uphold him, we should be like an&#xD;
ariny without a leader. The people&#xD;
need to be, awestruck; they are too&#xD;
Ignorant to guide themselves, they&#xD;
must be led like children."&#xD;
" Aristocratic ideas, very naturally'&#xD;
entertained by the nobles," said Mar-&#xD;
cello, laughing. " Caste exists in Italy&#xD;
as strongly as in Hindostan. Edu-&#xD;
cate the people, -  that is what our&#xD;
friend Bertani is always advocating,&#xD;
although I do not know how he&#xD;
would like it if he saw his doctrines&#xD;
completely carried into effect, - edu-&#xD;
cate your people, and see if they do&#xD;
not soon feel the king each in him-&#xD;
self.  We are still in the dark ages&#xD;
here ; we are ignorant and blind."&#xD;
" Heresy! heresy!" shouted Gual-&#xD;
terio, " down with' him! Why, he&#xD;
would set the country on fire, and&#xD;
burn up all the nobles if he could.!&#xD;
We used to think Bertani a radical,&#xD;
&#xD;
but he is moderate in comparison&#xD;
with Monsieur Benoni. Bertani our&#xD;
minister forever !" he said, raising&#xD;
his glass. All the company filled&#xD;
theirs and drank to the minister.&#xD;
Camilla touched his glass," I drink&#xD;
to you," she said in a low voice, "not&#xD;
to your title ; if I drank to the King&#xD;
it would not be to his crown."&#xD;
" lie would forget that he wore one&#xD;
whilst watching your lovely lips.".&#xD;
"Bertani," said the Count Gual-&#xD;
terio, "what was that the Cabinet&#xD;
agreed upon the other day in their&#xD;
last sitting ?&#xD;
Bertani turned away to answer;&#xD;
the conversation had become general&#xD;
again.&#xD;
Madame de Turenne rose. "I de-&#xD;
test politics," she said, '-when there&#xD;
are ladies present." Bertani offered&#xD;
his arm to her. They all left the&#xD;
table.&#xD;
"Are you jealous ?" she said.&#xD;
"Of whom ? I must know who my&#xD;
adversary is, before I honor him with&#xD;
such a sentiment."&#xD;
"I mean, should you be? Of the&#xD;
King, for instance?"&#xD;
No,.I am   not, nor could I be,"&#xD;
said Bertani.&#xD;
"You really then despise me, not&#xD;
laughingly qs Marcello does, but se-&#xD;
riously," looking up at him, with two&#xD;
large tears starting in her beautiful&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
" I should despise myself if I did."&#xD;
"0 Monsieur Bertani, you are so&#xD;
strong in yourself, so superior to all&#xD;
the men I ever knew, that I feel;for&#xD;
the first time in my life, a sensation,&#xD;
ofmistrust when with you; it seems&#xD;
to mue as if no arts, nio superficial&#xD;
charms, would have any effect on&#xD;
&#xD;
you, - as if I must be, not seem, to&#xD;
make you my friend, to win your&#xD;
esteem, your friendship."&#xD;
"I should feel myself indeed truly&#xD;
honored if I might claim the title of&#xD;
your friend."&#xD;
"You know," she said, smiling,&#xD;
"that it is yours without asking&#xD;
for it."&#xD;
" I have been called proud, Ma-&#xD;
dame de Turenne, but you give me a&#xD;
right to be so'!"&#xD;
A gentleman came up to the host-&#xD;
ess just at that moment, and Bertani&#xD;
left her side ; he went to Ina, who&#xD;
was standing alone.&#xD;
"You are looking lovely," he said,&#xD;
"as Madame de Turenne has just&#xD;
been saying." Ina smiled. " Who&#xD;
gave you those flowers ?"&#xD;
" The bunch that was anony-&#xD;
mous ?'&#xD;
"No, the one that had a name."&#xD;
"When you tell me," she said&#xD;
archly, "who it was that sent those&#xD;
that. had no clew to betray them&#xD;
save the welcome they found in my&#xD;
heart, I will tell you the name of the&#xD;
person who sent me the others."&#xD;
"Marcello Benoni is paying you&#xD;
his court."&#xD;
"Are you paying yours to Ma-&#xD;
dame de Turenne ? " was the playful-&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
" A man is free," he said, laughing,&#xD;
"to court whom he will, but a wo-&#xD;
man is in a very different position."&#xD;
" And I tell you," she said, " that&#xD;
a woman, as she does not -take the&#xD;
initiative, is never to be blamed;-&#xD;
she passively stands and receives;&#xD;
but he who goes forward, and acts&#xD;
and says and does, is the one to be&#xD;
judged."&#xD;

"I scarcely recognize my Ina,"&#xD;
he said, lowering his voice. "Do you&#xD;
know, when you entered -the room&#xD;
with our hostess, I thought of the&#xD;
Queen of Sheba going to meet Solo-&#xD;
mon in all his glory, and the Virgin&#xD;
Mary being met by the angel of the&#xD;
annunciation ; the lilies seemed ,all&#xD;
around you in your white dress!"&#xD;
" Will you permit me," said Ma-&#xD;
dame de Turenne, " to present to&#xD;
you Le Marquis de Marchini ? Come,&#xD;
Monsieur, Bertani, let me deprive&#xD;
Mademoiselle of the sun which is&#xD;
daily hers for a few moments. " I&#xD;
cannot allow you," she said, as she&#xD;
left Ina, "to be under such tempting&#xD;
influences for a long time.. I am ca-&#xD;
pable of jealousy, although you are&#xD;
not. . A lady told me the other day&#xD;
that in her rage 'she had thrown&#xD;
'vitriol in her rival's face ; do you&#xD;
not think that was an     effective&#xD;
remedy ?  She spoiled the beauty of&#xD;
another woman, and lost the little&#xD;
that remained to her of her lover's&#xD;
heart !  Mademoiselle  Strahling's&#xD;
beauty would not be difficult to&#xD;
destroy because it is so delicate ;&#xD;
she is very much changed since last&#xD;
year, but I think she is more inter-&#xD;
esting, -do not you ? But as you do&#xD;
not speak to me, nor answer one&#xD;
question that I put you, I shall go&#xD;
and entertain my other guests."&#xD;
" No, stay, yet one moment," he&#xD;
said ; " one cannot get accustomed,&#xD;
after so muchlnight, to be left instan-&#xD;
taneously in the dark"&#xD;
" When will you come to see me,&#xD;
Monsieur Bertani ? your time is so&#xD;
precious, one almost feels conscien-&#xD;
tious about robbing you of it."&#xD;
"Would that you would think it&#xD;
&#xD;
worth one effort to steal some of&#xD;
it !"&#xD;
"When will you come then ? Them&#xD;
is nothing I hate so much as waiting."&#xD;
"'Se faire attendre, c'est se faire&#xD;
aimer !'" he said, laughing ; "at least&#xD;
it is a French proverb; but it would&#xD;
be the most difficult to practise upon,&#xD;
since whenever one begins to calcu.&#xD;
late, one finishes by punishing one's-&#xD;
s   Telf."&#xD;
"Then you will not tell me ? I&#xD;
shall wait for you all day !"&#xD;
" Camille,"  said  the  Countess&#xD;
Gualterio, " I want to speak to you,,&#xD;
She drew her aside. "You are mak.&#xD;
ing your lover wretched."&#xD;
," What lover, my dear?" with&#xD;
utter surprise.&#xD;
"Your friend, then, your admirer,&#xD;
young Marchini."&#xD;
" 0," with a shrug of her should.&#xD;
ders, "if I had to look out for all the&#xD;
men who are wretched, I should&#xD;
have little time left for my own&#xD;
pleasure!" .&#xD;
" You. are heartless ; last week&#xD;
you dismissed poor Miro, and this&#xD;
week Marchini is to be the new&#xD;
victim., You will pay for this some&#xD;
day or other; be sure, Camilla, that&#xD;
one 'day or another you will suffer&#xD;
yourself. Bertani is a dangerous&#xD;
man to play with !"&#xD;
"Is he ?" she said, laughing; "we&#xD;
shall see ! In the mean time you&#xD;
have deprived me of a delightful t&amp;amp;1-&#xD;

That evening, when all her com.-&#xD;
pany was gone, Madame de Turene&#xD;
sat long in her room, alone. The&#xD;
splashing of her little Venus fountain&#xD;
made her nervous ; she rang the bel&#xD;
fois her maid to remove it to the&#xD;
&#xD;
conservatory. She was alone again.&#xD;
How distinctly the clock ticked out&#xD;
the fast-flying time! She uttered an&#xD;
exclamation of impatience, and put&#xD;
her hand against the pendulum, td&#xD;
stop its motion. , At last the lights&#xD;
were extinguished, and if Ina could&#xD;
have looked into that chamber, her&#xD;
.question would have been answered,&#xD;
for there on the pillow-case, over the&#xD;
letter "C," which formed part of the&#xD;
embroidered monogram, a tear glit-&#xD;
tered like a large diamond.&#xD;
One of Ina's bouquets was placed in&#xD;
a vase of water ; the other she kissed&#xD;
and held in her hand as she slept.&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE next morning, at&#xD;
hour, Ina received&#xD;
&#xD;
an early&#xD;
a little&#xD;
&#xD;
scented note ; it was sealed with a.&#xD;
coronet, under which letters, "C. M.&#xD;
T.," were intwined in red, green, and&#xD;
gold; it said:-&#xD;
" CARA DAMIGELLA, - Would you&#xD;

" PREGIATA SIGNORA, - I should&#xD;

"INA STROHLING."&#xD;
"I have an invitation for you,"&#xD;
she said to Marcello, " divine who it&#xD;
is from. The fairest of her sex, yet&#xD;
very dark, with eyes that would kill&#xD;
and give life at once, with hands&#xD;
that are warm to the touch but mar-&#xD;
ble to the sight ; with a heart that&#xD;
has not yet found its master, yet is&#xD;
mistress of all,-who is it?"&#xD;
"I read your riddle in four, and&#xD;
guess at once that it is Madame de&#xD;
Turenne." Marcello was glad to see&#xD;
that Ina had become, during the last&#xD;
few days, something of her former&#xD;
self again; he did not know to what&#xD;
to ascribe it, but there was an ani-&#xD;
mation in her face that had nothing&#xD;
in it of her former listless sadness.&#xD;

before ?&#xD;

would have me compare you, I sup=&#xD;
pose, to Leonardo da Vinci at once&#xD;
He alone, I believe, combined perfect&#xD;
genius, beauty, strength, and grace."&#xD;
"Thank you for the suggestion,'&#xD;
said Marcello,- laughing. "Yes,I&#xD;
think we are alike ! it is encouraging&#xD;
at least, to know that we agree upon&#xD;
but one point."&#xD;
"I do not wonder," said Ina,."that&#xD;
Madame de Turenne finds you so&#xD;
provoking. I would not ask you, as&#xD;
she does, to coie with your arms&#xD;
poses, but to bring them all, that&#xD;
I might fight you with each suc-&#xD;
cessively."&#xD;
"And now, pray tell me," said&#xD;
Marcello, folding his arms, "with&#xD;
what noble qualities I am to endow&#xD;
Madame de Turenne. She is self-&#xD;
ish, for she 'only thinks of herself&#xD;
and her own personal vanity, at the&#xD;
expense of all others; she is heart-&#xD;
less, because she would rob every&#xD;
man of his heart,,and give him noth-&#xD;
ing in exchange ; she is cold, because&#xD;
she can play with impunity 'with&#xD;
fire without feeling the flames ; she&#xD;
is a finished coquette, and has every&#xD;
art that a beautiful woman of the&#xD;
world can produce to conquer with."&#xD;
&#xD;
if   " Ah," said Ina, archly. "I shall&#xD;
u begin to think that Monsieur Bertani&#xD;
d, is right, and that disappointment&#xD;
y- and wounded vanity     are rankling&#xD;
t under these scathing blasts ! 'Save&#xD;

t said that ?"&#xD;
y    "I do not know; it is a mis.&#xD;

- Mademoiselle Strihling, because -I&#xD;

t believe you to be worthy, of the&#xD;
noblest devotion, the purest love, the&#xD;
greatest sacrifices."&#xD;
"Pray, do not say these things to&#xD;
, me, Monsieur Marcello. I have told&#xD;
you that ,they pain me," said Ina,,&#xD;
blushing deeply.&#xD;
"I will not willingly offend you,&#xD;
but it is hard for a man always to&#xD;
chisel his words like marble. What&#xD;
is the opera to be to-night ?"&#xD;
" La  Favorita, I   believe.  The.&#xD;
music is exquisite, but Italian," said&#xD;
Ina, smiling.&#xD;
"It is a good choice for Madame&#xD;
de Turenne, but pray tell mie what&#xD;
does that mean ?"&#xD;
"It means that it is passionate,&#xD;
warm,    inteiise,  quickening  one's&#xD;
pulses, and hurrying    the beat of&#xD;
one's heart; that it breaks on your&#xD;
soul just 'as the grand waves do on&#xD;
the shore, and    leaves corals and&#xD;
pearls strewn on it, but that it'&#xD;
leaves you also restless and dissatis&#xD;
fled, and with a weary sense of&#xD;
something that you have had, but&#xD;
not enough. It is an exquisite per-&#xD;
fume that has passed away5'&#xD;
&#xD;
"Like the Italian   nature," said&#xD;
Marcello.&#xD;
"Perhaps so," said Ina, thought-&#xD;
fully and with a deep-drawn sigh.&#xD;
"And now tell me what is Ger-&#xD;
man music?"&#xD;
"It is like the depths of the sea&#xD;
itself. It is still and  strange, it&#xD;
responds to all in one's nature, it&#xD;
excites and satisfies ; one rises to&#xD;
the greatest possible heights, but&#xD;
when there one is not giddy, only&#xD;
wrapped in an ethereal atmosphere&#xD;
soft and bracing.; one floats on' the&#xD;
clouds, catches the tints of the rain-&#xD;
bow, the shadows on the mountains ;&#xD;
but one descends to earth ,refreshed&#xD;
and elevated."&#xD;
"Your definition, I believe, is true,"&#xD;
said Marcello; "at least I have felt&#xD;
thus; but, as Madame de Turenne&#xD;
once said, the' Italians feel music&#xD;
with all the nerves of their nature,&#xD;
more perhaps than any nation."&#xD;
"They feel it," said Ina, "perhaps,&#xD;
as, they feel all things, intensely for&#xD;
the time being. I believe such na-&#xD;
tures suffer more, and enjoy more&#xD;
acutely. But tempests cannot last&#xD;
long, they would sweep over the&#xD;
earth else and destroy it ; and so the&#xD;
chords of human nature would be&#xD;
broken if they were always swept&#xD;
over by a hand that attuned them'&#xD;
ever to great passions."&#xD;
"Yo'n think the Germans' feelings&#xD;
are more lasting, but that their&#xD;
enjoyment and suffering are less ? I&#xD;
would rather be an Italian, for at&#xD;
least then one forgets the pangs that&#xD;
are past."&#xD;
"It seems to me that this may be&#xD;
said of all the more northern na-&#xD;
tions; there is something in that&#xD;
&#xD;
Southern blood that touches upon&#xD;
the Oriental, and that refines every&#xD;
sense. If the Italians were colder,&#xD;
they never would be inspired by&#xD;
such divine dreams of art, but they&#xD;
would also be stronger, I think, asa,&#xD;
people."&#xD;
"Yes," said Marcello, "they look&#xD;
little at the consequences of their&#xD;
actions, they are not reflective, all&#xD;
with them is according to the im-&#xD;
pulse of the moment ; they are&#xD;
downcast by -a defeat, but they do&#xD;
not seem to know how to .rally and&#xD;
turn it into a victory ; they are poet-&#xD;
ically patriotic, but they have not&#xD;
the strength to make themselves&#xD;
really  respected   at  home, and&#xD;
honored abroad. It is strange that&#xD;
they who have lighted the world&#xD;
should stand aside in the dark them-&#xD;
selves to gaze at the illumination;&#xD;
and it is stranger still," he said,&#xD;
smiling, "that I should be discussing&#xD;
the 'Italians, as if I were not one&#xD;
of them. That is my Anglo-Saxon&#xD;
drop of blood that speaks ;- all&#xD;
iny sympathies are with Italy, but&#xD;
my reason is not here. Good morn-&#xD;
ing, Mademoiselle Strdhling ; my&#xD;
mother will be shocked if she comes&#xD;
in to breakfast and finds me still&#xD;
here. You know     she 'believes. in&#xD;
early hours and work. If we all&#xD;
thought that this was ennobling, and&#xD;
the true strength of a.country, as it&#xD;
is, we should be better off, and hap-&#xD;
pier than we are."&#xD;
Marcello went off with a lighter&#xD;
heart than he had had in some time.&#xD;
Ina 'had been so natural, he had&#xD;
talked with, her just as he had done&#xD;
before her long absence in Switzer-&#xD;
land; he had not seen her so natural&#xD;
&#xD;
,!&#xD;
&#xD;
INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8231-00000045"/>&#xD;
INA.                          87&#xD;
&#xD;
since then. What could it be that&#xD;
was weighing and pressing upon her&#xD;
poor heart? Bertani, Bertani! he&#xD;
rose ever like a dark cloud in Ina's&#xD;
horizon when he thought 'of her&#xD;
and why he knew not. He never&#xD;
had seen him seek an opportunity&#xD;
of being alone with Ina, he had&#xD;
scarcely surprised a look between&#xD;
them, and yet there was a mysteri-&#xD;
ous something that he did not fancy.&#xD;
In the evening at eight o'clock&#xD;
Madame de Turenne's coach stopped&#xD;
at Madame Benoni's door. Ina threw&#xD;
her opera-cloak around her shoul-&#xD;
ders, ,and -she and Marcello went&#xD;
down the long flight of steps to the&#xD;
street. Monsieur Bertani had not&#xD;
come, but Ina had handed Madame&#xD;
de -Turenne's note to the servant,&#xD;
saying, "If Monsieur Bertani comes&#xD;
this evening, give him this note."&#xD;
Madame Benoni had called Ina back,&#xD;
and said, " My dear, if you have&#xD;
any communications with Monsieur&#xD;
Bertani, I think it would be just as&#xD;
well to give them to me as to a&#xD;
domestic. Not that I have any curi-&#xD;
osity " (and, to do Madame Benoni&#xD;
justice, this was true) "about your&#xD;
correspondence, but I must say that&#xD;
I think it would be as well not to&#xD;
rouse suspicions in the minds of the&#xD;
vulgar."&#xD;
Ina had blushed painfully, and,&#xD;
.taking the, note from the servant's&#xD;
hand, she said, "I will, upon second&#xD;
thoughts, give it to Madame Benoni."&#xD;
She went and handed it, taking it&#xD;
out of the envelope, and pointing to&#xD;
Madame de Turenne's signature.&#xD;
"I thought so," said Madame Be-&#xD;
noni. "I have had my own private&#xD;
and particular thoughts about this&#xD;
&#xD;
t for some time. Young widows al.&#xD;
r ways have such an influence. I be.&#xD;
lieve our friend Bertani would go&#xD;
unscathed through a whole thicket&#xD;
of darts; but just one feather from&#xD;
her hand, and, sure as fate, he falls."&#xD;
Ina  started; her color left her&#xD;
pale -as a lily again. This terrible&#xD;
thought had never even entered her&#xD;
mind.' Bertani had made her wretch.&#xD;
ed enough, she ahad suffered agonies&#xD;
in her loneliness, she had been&#xD;
through   all  those   heart-rending&#xD;
doubts and fears as to whether or&#xD;
no he loved her as he used ; but her&#xD;
. misery had taken no such definite&#xD;
form as this.  It was ambition, poli-&#xD;
tics, the country, that she held as her&#xD;
ready- rivals, not any one woman.&#xD;
A thousand uncertain shadows had&#xD;
risen in her mind, but that the wo-&#xD;
man who was always- so marked in&#xD;
her attentions to her should be bent&#xD;
on robbing her of her all,-she had&#xD;
not thought of this ! and then; too,&#xD;
just as her heart was beating into&#xD;
life again. He had looked at her&#xD;
with those dark eyes as he used; he&#xD;
had held her again in his arms, had&#xD;
promised her. everything she most&#xD;
wished   on earth, and   yet in the&#xD;
midst of her new-flushed happiness&#xD;
she felt that all was uncertain in her&#xD;
grasp. She felt it, and refused to&#xD;
confess to herselfthat she did so. 0&#xD;
God, was all the old misery coming&#xD;
flooding back, to drown her moment's&#xD;
peace ? was there never an hour's&#xD;
rest on   earth? .All these dreary&#xD;
thoughts rushed across her mind as&#xD;
she followed Marcello to the, coach.&#xD;
He had offered her his arm, but she&#xD;
had not heeded his offer. Madame&#xD;
de Turenne looked out of the car-&#xD;
&#xD;
riage window, and said, hurriedly,&#xD;
"qEt Monsieur Bertani ?"  It struck&#xD;
on Ina's heart like g stiletto, it gave&#xD;
her such sudden pain.&#xD;
"It was so good of you to come,"&#xD;
said Madame de Turenne. " I gen-&#xD;
erally have to ask some dull, elderly&#xD;
person to matronize me. It is de-&#xD;
lightful to play the matron myself.&#xD;
I am so proud too of my own re-&#xD;
sponsibility."&#xD;
"Mademoiselle Strohling is not a&#xD;
foil," said Marcello, laughing ; " she&#xD;
may be the shield that shall turn&#xD;
aside two or three darts that have&#xD;
been aimed at the beautiful Madame&#xD;
de Turenne."&#xD;
"0, I can willingly spare several&#xD;
of my feigned admirers," said Ma-&#xD;
dame de Turenne, laughing also, "if&#xD;
they had not. the good taste them-&#xD;
selves to choose Mademoiselle Stroh-&#xD;
ling."&#xD;
"Beware," said Marcello, -" be-&#xD;
ware of jealousy, the green-eyed&#xD;
monster !"&#xD;
"Indeed, I would give them    all&#xD;
gladly away, with the exception of&#xD;
one."&#xD;
Ina started; who could that one&#xD;
be? She had said it so lightly, but&#xD;
many a true-word is spoken in jest !&#xD;
Ina had herself once told Bertani&#xD;
that she could be as jealous as Ros-&#xD;
munda. She did not dream     then&#xD;
that he would ever-give her cause tot&#xD;
be so. Now she was jealous, terri--&#xD;
bly so; she felt sick with jealousy.I&#xD;
She looked over at Madame de Tu-&#xD;
renne; she had on a white ermine&#xD;
cloak; it -contrasted so wonderfully&#xD;
with her dark hair ! Ina never&#xD;
knew before that she was so beauti-&#xD;
fuL. She wondered that she had not&#xD;
&#xD;
seen it at first; she had always&#xD;
thought her handsome, but she&#xD;
varied very much, and there were&#xD;
times when Ina had not admired her&#xD;
so much; now she looked dazzling in&#xD;
the dim light. As she leaned back in&#xD;
the coach it was with a sense of relief&#xD;
that Bertani was not there to see her&#xD;
as she did. They drove on in silence.&#xD;
" Are you not' well to-night, Mad-&#xD;
emoiselle Strohling ?"&#xD;
" Yes," said Ina, "but I have a&#xD;
bad headache."&#xD;
"I never had that in my life,"&#xD;
said Madame de Turenne.&#xD;
"No, nor the heart-ache either,"&#xD;
said Marcello ; " that is to come !&#xD;
'The greater is behind !' as 'in the&#xD;
witches' prophecy."&#xD;
"I have no doubt," said Madame&#xD;
de Turenne, "that you would gladly&#xD;
see me pierced through and through,&#xD;
but that .never will be. I should&#xD;
have too much pride to choose where&#xD;
I was not chosen, and so there will&#xD;
be no obstacle to my happiness ;&#xD;
you will not be gratified, Marcello !"&#xD;
The carriage drew up to -the bril-&#xD;
liantly lighted opera-house; they en-&#xD;
tered. Several young men with white&#xD;
cravats were lounging around the&#xD;
vestibule ; they bowed to Madame de&#xD;
Turenne as she passed.   "What a&#xD;
contrast !" one of them said to the&#xD;
other. " I wonder who she is ! Ma-&#xD;
dame de Turenne is safe in bringing&#xD;
a blond beauty with her ; at least&#xD;
there cannot be any comparison be-&#xD;
tween them." "No," said the other&#xD;
young gentleman, "chacun a son&#xD;
gonit!" "She must be English; she&#xD;
is really lovely, -so white, with that&#xD;
perfectly-golden hair ! why, her hair&#xD;
is a dream in itself. I must go and&#xD;
&#xD;
86                        INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8231-00000046"/>&#xD;
88                            INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
inquire who she is."   " No, here&#xD;
comes Georgioni; he always knows&#xD;
who everybody is."' " Yes, but he&#xD;
will be sure to say something disa-&#xD;
greeable, and I do not want to have&#xD;
my illusion broken up so soon; so I&#xD;
am going to find out in the best way&#xD;
myself, by paying a visit to Madame&#xD;
de Turenrde's box." Madame de Tu-&#xD;
renne had seated herself with her&#xD;
back to the stage ; she insisted on&#xD;
Ina's taking the seat that fronted on&#xD;
it. They had hung-up their cloaks, the&#xD;
overture had already begun. Madame&#xD;
de Turenne was dressed in black vel-&#xD;
vet, her neck and arms were bare,&#xD;
® and contrasted well with her dress;&#xD;
she had a diamond necklace around&#xD;
her throat. Ina had.on a pearl-col-&#xD;
ored silk, a white illusion cape over&#xD;
her shoulders, and her pearls around&#xD;
her neck. °There could not have been&#xD;
two more, different types than they&#xD;
were ; each seemed to -heighten and&#xD;
enhance the beauty and peculiar&#xD;
charms of the other. They seemed&#xD;
to set each other off, and 'neither&#xD;
knew that each was closely examining&#xD;
the other with a feeling of envy.&#xD;
"How fair you are !" said Madame&#xD;
de, Turenne to Ina; "'you are as&#xD;
white as snow."&#xD;
"Both inside and outside," said&#xD;
Marcello.&#xD;
"Which 'you. cruelly mean cannot&#xD;
be said of the lady opposite her;&#xD;
you cut like a diamond, neatly, but&#xD;
you do, your work well."&#xD;
Ina was looking intently on the&#xD;
stage., Camilla's eyes were wandering&#xD;
through the parquet; she had not&#xD;
seen him enter yet. ,&#xD;
" It is delightful," said Madame de&#xD;
Turenne, "to see anybody so inter-&#xD;
&#xD;
ested in the stage.  We old theatre.&#xD;
goers behave shamefully; we always&#xD;
think it elegant to look ennuyed aud&#xD;
generally bored; we talk all the time,&#xD;
drown the music, and dispirit the&#xD;
singers; it is only when there I&#xD;
some especial star, or some particular&#xD;
air. that pleases us, that we listen&#xD;
with any attention."&#xD;
"Yes, but then we listen so wholly,&#xD;
so intensely, that it makes 'up for all&#xD;
our previous indifference."      '&#xD;
"To those , few   that we flatter&#xD;
thus, but not to the others, I ima.&#xD;
gine. I always feel sorry for the&#xD;
poor things, it is so hard not to be&#xD;
the first."&#xD;
Ina glanced at her, and saw the&#xD;
color mount and mount again into&#xD;
her face. She followed the direction&#xD;
of her eyes, and in the box just oppo.&#xD;
site she saw Monsieur lertani; he&#xD;
held an opera-glass in his hand, and&#xD;
was looking over towards their loge,&#xD;
Camilla smiled and cast down her&#xD;
eyes.  Ina looked quickly away at&#xD;
the stage ; presently she glanced over&#xD;
again, and he had disappeared,'-&#xD;
surely he was coming over to them!&#xD;
The 'door of their box opened, but it&#xD;
was not he. The first entre-acte had&#xD;
begun.   Camilla was full of anima-&#xD;
tion; she presented all the gentlemen,&#xD;
that entered to Ina.  " Now I know,"&#xD;
she said, laughing, "*hat a pleasure&#xD;
it would be to be a mother. I should&#xD;
have acquired a few years, but I&#xD;
should be just introducing my young&#xD;
daughter into the world ; I should&#xD;
have forgotten myself entirely, and&#xD;
be full of projects for her future. I&#xD;
think it would be delightful !"&#xD;
" I am afraid," said a young bean;&#xD;
who congratulated himself on heli&#xD;
&#xD;
a bel esprit, "that you  would  be,&#xD;
courted by the same admirers, like&#xD;
the mother and daughter in the " Pelo&#xD;
d'Oro"; that would be very bad, you&#xD;
know !"&#xD;
."A man would be like Hippolyte&#xD;
torn between Phadre and Aricie,"&#xD;
said another.&#xD;
"'Ce n'est plus cette ardeur dans&#xD;
mes veines cache ! "' said Camilla,&#xD;
laughing. "'C'est Venus toute entire&#xD;
a sa proie attachee' It would not&#xD;
be difficult to feel that, incited and&#xD;
stung to it by jealousy."  Her eye&#xD;
rested accidentally on Ina. Ina start-&#xD;
ed,. as if a snake had stung her.&#xD;
"You would act the part well, Mad-&#xD;
emoiselle Strdhling; that movement&#xD;
was really effective !  I 'begin to&#xD;
think that the Germans have quite&#xD;
as much feeling as we Italians ; do&#xD;
not you ? "&#xD;
"I do not know," said Ina. "I have&#xD;
never been both.    The god    who&#xD;
tried being first a man and then a wo-&#xD;
man could perhaps throw himself also&#xD;
into two different nations, and have&#xD;
two separate natures, I cannot." She&#xD;
spoke hastily, as if she were slightly&#xD;
nettled; it was true every word Ca-&#xD;
milla said seemed to pierce like a&#xD;
thorn into her soft flesh; she was&#xD;
tired of being tortured. The second&#xD;
and third act had finished, the fourth&#xD;
had begun, and still Bertani did not&#xD;
make his appearance. Ina said it&#xD;
Was beautiful, and no sound of the&#xD;
music penetrated her ears ; she saw&#xD;
nothing before her eyes although she&#xD;
was looking on the stage, it seemed a&#xD;
great blur; she listened only with&#xD;
painful intensity to every step that&#xD;
approached and passed the door of&#xD;
their box. Camilla's spirits too were&#xD;
&#xD;
beginning to flag ; she had no more&#xD;
ready badinage with her admirers.&#xD;
There had been a crowd in her box&#xD;
all the evening, but now she looked&#xD;
weary, and she leaned back with a&#xD;
great sigh. Just at this moment a&#xD;
heavy, determined tread,-Ina knew&#xD;
it so well,- the door opened quickly,&#xD;
and Berta  stood before them. Ca-&#xD;
milla's chee  tiat had grown pale,&#xD;
flushed'now, an she regained in that&#xD;
moment all her beauty, which had&#xD;
lost its brilliancy during the last half-&#xD;
hour.&#xD;
" You have left us to ourselves all&#xD;
the evening in the most unchristian&#xD;
manner," said Madame de Turenne,&#xD;
holding out her hand to Monsieur&#xD;
Bertani.&#xD;
"Your box'was filled to overflow-&#xD;
ing with your most ardent admirers,&#xD;
and one lorgnon besides my own has&#xD;
ever been pointed this way ; next to&#xD;
myself, I pitied the owner of it."&#xD;
"Where ? " said Camilla. ".I have&#xD;
seen neither-one nor the other."&#xD;
" Look at No. 12 in the first row,"&#xD;
said Bertani, " and you will see the&#xD;
luckless knight-errant ; he has evi-&#xD;
dently been banished from paradise&#xD;
forever."&#xD;
Madame de Turenne turned her&#xD;
glass that way, searched for a mo-&#xD;
ment in the direction that Bertani&#xD;
had given, and then turned quickly,&#xD;
away and colored deeply ; it was&#xD;
Miro Raimondi's glass that had been&#xD;
elevated all the evening to her box.&#xD;
"He annoys me beyond measure,"&#xD;
she said impatiently; "a man has no&#xD;
right to annoy a woman."&#xD;
"'My dear Madame de Turenne, it&#xD;
surely is enough punishment to be&#xD;
exiled from heaven, but not to be&#xD;
&#xD;
IN.                                89&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8231-00000047"/>&#xD;
INA.                               91&#xD;
&#xD;
allowed to turn one's eyes that way&#xD;
is tyranny indeed."&#xD;
Bertani took a seat near Ina, just&#xD;
opposite Camilla. " You have been&#xD;
creating quite an excitement in the&#xD;
theatre this evening," he said ; "a&#xD;
gentleman asked me if I knew that&#xD;
pearl and that diamond that shed&#xD;
lustre one on the other. I was&#xD;
proud, of course, to claim almost more&#xD;
than an acquaintance with both."&#xD;
Camilla looked at him under ,her&#xD;
eyes, and then dropped the lids; it&#xD;
was a way she had. He took up her&#xD;
fan, and said,, "It reminds me of&#xD;
those linesin Shakespeare,-&#xD;
It glows the delicate cheeks that it does cool,&#xD;
And what it undoes, does.'&#xD;
I could not help thinking of Cleo-&#xD;
patra all this evening as I looked at&#xD;
you; you might have sat for pictures&#xD;
of Cleopatra and Juliet."&#xD;
"Hush!" said Camilla, "this is&#xD;
that lively scene at the foot of the&#xD;
cross." They all turned their eyes&#xD;
to the stage. Emanuele was so near&#xD;
Ina that she could feel his breath&#xD;
on her shoulder ; she trembled. The&#xD;
prima donna had a beautiful* voice&#xD;
and sang with passion, the tenor&#xD;
was one of $he best then, on the&#xD;
stage ; he sang " Eleonora, Eleonora,"&#xD;
and she answered, "Grazie, grazie."&#xD;
Her voice killed the house.&#xD;
"Iddio'ti perdoni."&#xD;
" E tu, Fernando,  e tu?"&#xD;
There was a moment's pause, and&#xD;
then he burst forth in impassioned&#xD;
accents, "Si, io t'amo sempre pin."*&#xD;
It thrilled through the whole theatre.&#xD;
Camilla looked at Bertani under her&#xD;
eyes; it was a look full of warmth, it&#xD;
seemed to say, " Ed io t'amo sempre&#xD;
* "I love thee evermore."&#xD;
&#xD;
pin."  Bertani answered that glance&#xD;
with one that burnt into her he t&#xD;
she colored into her very hair, she&#xD;
t grew pale, and colored again. Ina&#xD;
saw  that' look exchanged between&#xD;
them; her heart stopped      beating,&#xD;
and then she felt faint, but she sat&#xD;
quite still.  Then came the beautiful&#xD;
duet, and then the heroine dies, and&#xD;
all was over.&#xD;
"Permit me," said      Bertani to&#xD;
Madame de Turenne, "to help you&#xD;
on   with   your  cloak."   Marcello&#xD;
helped Ina on with hers, but she did&#xD;
not feel it ; she only saw Bertani;&#xD;
she saw him raise Camilla's long&#xD;
dark curl, that hung over her white&#xD;
shoulders, as he placed the cloak&#xD;
under it. He thought no one was&#xD;
looking at him. Ina's back was&#xD;
turned, that he knew, and Marcello&#xD;
was just behind her, helping her to&#xD;
arrange her cloak, but there was a&#xD;
small mirror opposite where they&#xD;
stood. Ina's quick eye saw all in this;&#xD;
he raised the curl, and pressed it to&#xD;
his lips ; Camilla turned half around,&#xD;
and looked up into his eyes all full&#xD;
of love ; it was enough ! She stag.&#xD;
gered, she grew faint. Marcello had&#xD;
seen all too.&#xD;
" Lean- on me," he said, and he&#xD;
drew her arm   under his.   "You d&#xD;
not look well."&#xD;
"I am not well," said Ina, quietl ;&#xD;
"for some time I have felt poorly,&#xD;
but it is nothing, it will pass." They&#xD;
hurried to the coach. Emanuele and&#xD;
Madame de Turenne lingered behind.&#xD;
Marcello opened the door of the&#xD;
carriage, put Ina in, and then waited&#xD;
at the door ; it was but five minutes,&#xD;
but it seemed to Ina an eternity'.&#xD;
Then Madame de Turenne camne-&#xD;
&#xD;
gayly out, leaning on Emanuele's&#xD;
m."Pardon me," she said, "for&#xD;
keeping you waiting, but we went&#xD;
back to look for my fan. I left it in&#xD;
the box."&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
THE   carriage drove off, and Ma-&#xD;
dame de Turenne naturally&#xD;
ordered it first to Madame Benoni's&#xD;
house; here they left Marcello and&#xD;
Ina.; they bade them good evening,&#xD;
and then Bertani saw Camilla home.&#xD;
That night poor Ina went to her&#xD;
room without knowing what she did.&#xD;
Monsieur Benoni was waiting for&#xD;
them in the parlor ; she answered his&#xD;
questions mechanically ; she told him&#xD;
what opera it. was, that .it had been&#xD;
beautiful, that the theatre was crowd-&#xD;
ed, that the prima donna had been&#xD;
called out before the curtain; she&#xD;
had presence of mind sufficient to&#xD;
light her candle. Marcello opened&#xD;
the door for her; she said good night,&#xD;
and walked slowly to her room; she&#xD;
shut the door, and, was alone with&#xD;
her great misery. " 0 God," she&#xD;
said, "I cannot bear any more ; my&#xD;
very soul is wrung to the core. Be-&#xD;
,fore my face ! Does he not know&#xD;
what sorrow is ? Can he love her ?&#xD;
No, it cannot be; but she is doing&#xD;
all she can to lure him on ; he is&#xD;
a man,,- 0 God ! what shallI do ?&#xD;
I must go to him, I must go to him;&#xD;
I will fliig myself upon my knees&#xD;
before him; I will tell him that I&#xD;
san dying, that he is killing* me ;&#xD;
perhaps some day he will ask for&#xD;
mercy himself ! 0 Emanuele, that&#xD;
look, that terrible look of love in&#xD;
&#xD;
your eyes ! I shall go mad if I can-&#xD;
not forget it ! And she,-I think&#xD;
she would tempt a man to hell, with&#xD;
her passionate glances. I was prais-&#xD;
ing her to-day, I took her part be-&#xD;
fore Marcello ; he was right, .he is&#xD;
always right. 0, if I could but lie&#xD;
down and sleep, and never wake&#xD;
again."&#xD;
Ina passed the night walking up&#xD;
and down her room, like a rest-&#xD;
less spirit ; all night she paced to&#xD;
and fro; sometimes she would fling&#xD;
open the window for air, the. blood&#xD;
beat so hot in her brow and temples ;&#xD;
sometimes she would suddenly go&#xD;
and sit down and begin to write ;&#xD;
sfie would get as far as " 0 Emanu-&#xD;
ele," and then she would start up&#xD;
again, and walk the room, she could&#xD;
not collect her thoughts to write.&#xD;
And so the morning broke, and&#xD;
found poor Ina, like a wan shadow,&#xD;
still walking her room; she was&#xD;
weary and sick, yet she must avoid&#xD;
all remark, must arrange her toilet.&#xD;
She smiled a bitter smile as she&#xD;
caught a glimpse of herself in the&#xD;
long glass in her pearl=colored silk.&#xD;
She took the pearls from her neck,&#xD;
and looked at them. " They are truly&#xD;
a- gift of tears," she said. She undid&#xD;
her dress, and remembered how glad&#xD;
her heart had been when she put it&#xD;
on; and she,-what was she doing&#xD;
now ? Sleeping the quiet sleep of&#xD;
happiness ; with a smile of triumph&#xD;
perhaps on her proud lips, as she&#xD;
added Emanuele Bertani's name to&#xD;
her list of conquests, in her dreams.&#xD;
"0O happy Madame de Turenne ! with&#xD;
all the world at her feet, could eshe&#xD;
not spare me my only love ? 0 God,&#xD;
my heart is breaking, it pains me&#xD;

&#xD;
so!" Ina dressed herself now wit&#xD;
care for. breakfast ; she did not wis&#xD;
Marcello to . see the traces that&#xD;
sleepless night had lert ; she feare&#xD;
that he began to surmise some things&#xD;
She went down to breakfast, bu&#xD;
Marcello was not there, and Madam&#xD;
Benoni, always intent alone on he&#xD;
own troubles, did not take any no&#xD;
tice of poor Ina's. sad eyes.&#xD;
"I wish, Mademoiselle Str5hling,&#xD;
Madame Benoni began, "that yoi&#xD;
would take Adelheide and Maria t&#xD;
the galleries; I think it is time thai&#xD;
a love of art should be cultivated, I&#xD;
may say created, in them. You know&#xD;
my constitution is delicate, I am&#xD;
not fitted to make an exertion, my&#xD;
whole nature shrinks from it,' any-&#xD;
thing of -the kind would fall on my&#xD;
nervous system; it has been shattered&#xD;
by constant anxiety, broken by the&#xD;
repeated trials that an over-sensitive&#xD;
frame has been called upon to bear.&#xD;
Therefore it is, my dear Mademoiselle&#xD;
Strdhling, that I rely so wholly on&#xD;
you; I place in you a confidence&#xD;
that I may say is rare, but my firm&#xD;
belief is that you repay this trust&#xD;
with perfect rectitude."&#xD;
"What galleries shall I take them&#xD;
to, Madame?"- said Ina, absently.&#xD;
"It is rather fatiguing for me,&#xD;
Mademoiselle Strdhling, to select the&#xD;
particular placeto which you are to&#xD;
take my daughters. I had thought&#xD;
that I might leave that to you, but I&#xD;
begin to fear that I must necessarily&#xD;
expect all care to fall back on me.&#xD;
I cannot free myself from it, it will&#xD;
naturally wear me out in time ; but&#xD;
it matters not, so long as one's duty&#xD;
is clone, if one die at the mast ; that&#xD;
I have always said, and I~ believe&#xD;
&#xD;
h there are few who will not give nm&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
h credit for it."-&#xD;
a    Poor Ina, who had not listened to&#xD;
d what Madame Benoni was saying, on&#xD;
s. hearing her allusion to a mast sud.&#xD;
t denly tried to collect her ideas, and&#xD;
e said " What mast?" to herself; for.&#xD;
r tunately she did not give vent to her&#xD;
- thoughts, and only answered, feeling&#xD;
that the time had come for her to&#xD;
say something, "I think I will go&#xD;
u to the King's Palace." So it was&#xD;
o agreed that she should take the child.&#xD;
t dren in the carriage to see the pie-&#xD;
tures. They were so glad, when they&#xD;
heard it, that it touched Ina's heart;&#xD;
she thought even if she was so mis-&#xD;
erable herself, it was pleasant still&#xD;
- to give some pleasure to others. In.&#xD;
stead of taking their lessons that&#xD;
morning they were to go to the&#xD;
King's gallery; and at twelve o'clock&#xD;
they drove off, that the young girls&#xD;
might see those wonders of art for&#xD;
the first time. Adelheide was just&#xD;
fifteen, and her younger sister was&#xD;
fourteen years old; but Madame Be-&#xD;
noni had very strict ideas with re-&#xD;
gard to young girls, and she had&#xD;
never before this thought that the&#xD;
time had arrived when they should in&#xD;
any way be emancipated.' They set&#xD;
off together, after having received a&#xD;
thousand admonitions from their&#xD;
mother as to the propriety of their&#xD;
conduct.I&#xD;
" How lovely it is," said Adelheide,&#xD;
"to  be alone   with  Mademoiselle&#xD;
Strdhling ! You will tell us all about&#xD;
the pictures, and then we shall go to&#xD;
walk in 'the gardens. 0-, it will be&#xD;
delightful !" -    ..&#xD;
"Yes," said Ina. She was think-&#xD;
ing of the time when she too was&#xD;
&#xD;
young, and her heart was filled and sat-&#xD;
isfied by just such simple pleasures ;&#xD;
but that was past now, never to come&#xD;
again. They arrived at the Palace.&#xD;
The girls were all excitement ; they&#xD;
went up the long stairs, each flight&#xD;
to their young fancies enhancing the&#xD;
great mystery and charm; at last&#xD;
they entered the vast rooms, one after&#xD;
the other lined with immortal beauty.&#xD;
laa pointed out to the girls many&#xD;
of the most beautiful pictures ; she,&#xD;
thought it foolish to distract their&#xD;
minds with letting them linger on&#xD;
all. They must seize the more strik-&#xD;
ing to carry home in their mem-&#xD;
ories, and then they should come&#xD;
again and study them; but in every&#xD;
frame, from Judith to the Madonna&#xD;
della Seggiola, she seemed to see&#xD;
something of Madame de Turenne's&#xD;
face, and turned away with pain.&#xD;
She could not divest herself of the&#xD;
idea that she saw 'her eyes looking&#xD;
out through each, now dusky with&#xD;
passion, as in the Judith, now glo-&#xD;
rified and transfigured by her holy&#xD;
mission, as in the Madonna; in Ti-&#xD;
tian's mistress was the same look,-&#xD;
where should she go to escape those&#xD;
eyes? She was wandering wearily&#xD;
on when her eyes' fell on a lovely&#xD;
picture of maidenhood personified,&#xD;
fresh and fair, breathing the inno-&#xD;
cence of a young life, the lips slightly&#xD;
parted, as if to let the soft air play&#xD;
upon them more freely, the eyes full&#xD;
of a shadowy light, the form exqui-&#xD;
.sitely rounded. "How sweet !" said&#xD;
mna, and she turned to the catalogue&#xD;
to see what it was. Her heart jumped&#xD;
into her throat as she saw the artist's&#xD;
laine; it was Greuze ! Had he not&#xD;
often told her, when they were in&#xD;
&#xD;
the little cottage together, that she&#xD;
was like his pictures. " Why, it&#xD;
looks like you when you first came&#xD;
to our house," said Adelheide. Ina&#xD;
had a tear in her eye as she passed&#xD;
on. .A lady stood near one of the&#xD;
pictures of the Virgin; by her side&#xD;
were two little girls and a French&#xD;
bonne. The lady had on a black moire&#xD;
silk with a long trais that reached&#xD;
nearly half across the room; a huge&#xD;
coil of hair was wound around her&#xD;
head; her hands'in yellow kid gloves&#xD;
were hanging helplessly from her&#xD;
wrists; her eyes, glowing with a&#xD;
fixed vacancy, were staring at the&#xD;
pictures.&#xD;
"II should like to know who that&#xD;
lady is with that queer expression,"&#xD;
said Adelheide. "Her eyes stare&#xD;
like a new-born baby's, and do not&#xD;
seem to take anything in; how&#xD;
strange the part in her hair looks!&#xD;
She looks like a person playing queen&#xD;
in a fourth-rate theatre."&#xD;
Ina was 'not listening to the girls,&#xD;
but now she looked up, and'saw this&#xD;
same lady gazing fixedly t her.&#xD;
"Miss Strahling, I thought so;&#xD;
how are you?' I hardly recognized you,&#xD;
you looked so ill, and I-suppose you&#xD;
would scarcely know me again, but I&#xD;
thought I had prepared you for the&#xD;
change. I told you that I was far.&#xD;
from the same person when I was&#xD;
dressed- in my French dresses ; and&#xD;
then I had no hair on my head when&#xD;
you saw me. My husband says I&#xD;
ought. not to be so regardless when&#xD;
travelling, buthe'says too -the dar-&#xD;
ling ! my own dear husband - that.I&#xD;
am one of the few, the very few, who&#xD;
can afford to neglect my appearance ;&#xD;
my husband says that I am the only&#xD;

&#xD;
woman he ever cares to look at at all;&#xD;
my husband thinks there is some-&#xD;
thing Easternin my style, but when&#xD;
I am in Lee, -that is where our&#xD;
lands are, and our very lovely home,&#xD;
our estate,- then when there, I often&#xD;
wrap :around me my lace shawl in the&#xD;
true Spanish style. INlet it fall from&#xD;
my head quite around my face ; then&#xD;
my husband says I look Southern.&#xD;
Everybody in Lee says that Mrs. Col-.&#xD;
man is an exception to the rule, and&#xD;
she can do just as she chooses. I&#xD;
tell my beloved husband that he is&#xD;
blinded by partiality for me, but it is&#xD;
no wonder, Mademoiselle Str5hling.&#xD;
I am not at atll like, the Americans, I&#xD;
am more vivid, more startling ; there&#xD;
is, as my husband says, more of the&#xD;
Orient about me. I was just stand-&#xD;
ing before a picture of Cleopatra, and&#xD;
my bonne says, my Parisian bonne,&#xD;
that it is very like me as 'I was last&#xD;
wdek at the King's ball. I was really&#xD;
elegant, Mademoiselle Strohling; I&#xD;
had on all my peerless jewels, and&#xD;
my coronet on my brow. My hus-&#xD;
band is so fond of me when, he sees&#xD;
me dressed, but my husband does not-&#xD;
wish me to create too much of a sen-&#xD;
dation. I often say to.him, 'Now, my&#xD;
own darling husband, don't you be&#xD;
jealous'; not that I would really&#xD;
give him any cause, but my husband,&#xD;
is so sensitive. I feel that a truly&#xD;
noble-minded woman can have no&#xD;
thought -no, none -save for her&#xD;
husband and her own children; they&#xD;
must necessarily absorb her entirely ;&#xD;
she can have no centre, no circum-&#xD;
ference, save them, -is it not true,&#xD;
Miss Str5hling ?"&#xD;
" I think you are right,"' said&#xD;
Ina, her mind wandering far away&#xD;
&#xD;
from Mrs. Colman to Emanuele Ber.&#xD;
tani.&#xD;
" I come here," said Mrs. Colman,&#xD;
"to live amongst the old masters.&#xD;
My husband- bought me a Murillo&#xD;
when I was in Spain ; he sent it to&#xD;
our beautiful estates. I used to gaze&#xD;
at that picture, and I think I may&#xD;
say that I grew purer and holier~&#xD;
yes, purer and holier - every time I&#xD;
stood before it. I think art so ele.&#xD;
eating to the soul, Miss Strahling; it&#xD;
increases its pristine purity; as the&#xD;
Italians so beautifully express it,&#xD;
' animy candidy.' How chaste their&#xD;
language is !_ and their natures too, so&#xD;
transparent, so limpid, if I may speak&#xD;
it in their own poetical terms ! I have&#xD;
a soul so set to poetry, -and 'sois&#xD;
my husband's, and so are my darlings',&#xD;
my only ones. You have not noticed&#xD;
my treasures, Miss Strohling. I bring&#xD;
them with me, to initiate their minds&#xD;
early in the mystery of true inspira-&#xD;
tion. They are very Greek in their&#xD;
styles, Miss Strohling; they would&#xD;
not have been apt to inherit an&#xD;
American type from me, you know!&#xD;
What a misfortune for a mother to&#xD;
have nothing   Oriental about her!&#xD;
My own, my husband, said that was&#xD;
what first drew him to me, the Cash-&#xD;
merian in me ! Was it not a beautiful&#xD;
idea? so like my husband ! I was&#xD;
passionately in love with him the'&#xD;
moment I set my eyes on him, and&#xD;
so was he with me, - passionately,-&#xD;
but purely ; as I said before, every&#xD;
feeling was such as the angels might&#xD;
have felt. I was looking at my pre-&#xD;
cious ones a moment ago, and think-&#xD;
ing how much I had to be grateful&#xD;
for. I was thinking how like Evan-&#xD;
geline looks to the infant Saviour,&#xD;
&#xD;
and how much Evelina resembles the&#xD;
little John; do they not, Miss Stroh-&#xD;
ling ? Greek types,, you know, both !&#xD;
I think I never have met with more&#xD;
truly refined -natures than theirs, ex-&#xD;
quisitely delicate, so sensitive to the&#xD;
beautiful; they perfectly understand&#xD;
all these, pictures, yet my precious&#xD;
Evangeline is'but four years old, and&#xD;
my treasure Evelina is just three. I&#xD;
think God gave them to me because&#xD;
he was so pleased with me, that is&#xD;
what I always say to my husband."&#xD;
"Yes," said Ina, not knowing well&#xD;
what she was answering to.&#xD;
0," looking at her watch, "I must&#xD;
go! I have already taken in such a&#xD;
draught of genius that I feel it in my&#xD;
very veins. I have lingered beyond&#xD;
'my wonted hour. I very much fear&#xD;
that my own husband will be anxious&#xD;
about me, the darling ! .I cannot&#xD;
wait another moment, I must run&#xD;
home and kiss him; he will be quite&#xD;
out of his mind if I stay another in-&#xD;
stant, it might kill him. I must say&#xD;
good morning, Miss Str5hling, I shall&#xD;
hope to meet you again." So saying,&#xD;
she walked away with the becoming&#xD;
dignity which her train demanded,&#xD;
and behind her at a respectful dis-&#xD;
tance followed her bonne and the&#xD;
two infant Greek types.&#xD;
"Was that English she was talk-&#xD;
ing ?" said Adelheide. "She went on&#xD;
just like a mill, and never waited&#xD;
for you to say a word ; what a queer&#xD;
lady !" They walked on, looking at&#xD;
the pictures,, until Adelheide said,&#xD;
"We are tired, dear Mademoiselle;&#xD;
will you take us into the garden a&#xD;
little while ?"&#xD;
"Yes, certainly." '&#xD;
'The girls went on in front of~ Inal&#xD;
&#xD;
She stopped a moment to look again&#xD;
at the Greuze picture, when a- gen-&#xD;
tleman stoped too, and stepped near&#xD;
her; he spoke in French.&#xD;
"Pardon, j'ai mis mon pied sur&#xD;
votre robe," he said, touching his hat&#xD;
to her, and looking at her intently.&#xD;
She looked up, quite startled, and&#xD;
said, " O, cela ne fait rien, Monsieur."&#xD;
" Mais vous etes charmante, gen-&#xD;
tille, et belle comme votre portrait;&#xD;
etes-vous seule ?"&#xD;
She colored crimson, hastily drew&#xD;
down her veil, and ran after Adel-&#xD;
heide and Marie, who had already&#xD;
gained the other room.&#xD;
" Do not leave me alone," she said,&#xD;
quickly. " I was frightened, some&#xD;
one spoke to me!'"&#xD;
They went down the stairs, and&#xD;
into the gardens. The fountains&#xD;
were playing ; the trees were already&#xD;
in bloom; it was lovely. The girls&#xD;
were enchanted. Suddenly Ina was&#xD;
aware- that some one was following&#xD;
them. She looked around and saw&#xD;
the same gentleman who had ad-&#xD;
dressed her in the gallery. She&#xD;
hastened her steps, and said in an&#xD;
under voice to the girls, "'Do not&#xD;
look around, we are followed ; quick- -&#xD;
ly let us turn into this side path.&#xD;
They hastened - in, and presently&#xD;
came too a statue, and then a little&#xD;
side walk, all rustic. A lady and&#xD;
gentleman were sitting lower down,&#xD;
on one of the stone seats; the gen-&#xD;
tleman held the lady's parasol, and&#xD;
was tracing something on the gravel&#xD;
at her feet ; the lady's head was so&#xD;
near his shoulder that she seemed&#xD;
almost to be leaning on it.&#xD;
" Look there !" said Adeiheide,&#xD;
pointing to them. Ina raised her&#xD;

eyes and recognized Emanuele Ber-&#xD;
tani and Madame de Turenne'! Ca-&#xD;
milla had heard the coming steps,&#xD;
and had raised-her head hastily, and&#xD;
turned to see who it was. She&#xD;
blushed scarlet, and rose to greet&#xD;
Mademoiselle Strbhling. Ina would&#xD;
have given worlds to hide herself&#xD;
anywhere, even under the earth, but&#xD;
it was too late ; she felt that her&#xD;
face had- become rigid; it hurt her&#xD;
to move her lips-; her mouth seemed&#xD;
as if it was locked, and she could&#xD;
not open it.&#xD;
" Good morning," said Madame de&#xD;
Turenne. "We are both early birds.&#xD;
I was wandering about alone and&#xD;
met Monsieur Bertani, and he had&#xD;
pity on my lonely condition and&#xD;
took me this lovely walk. Is it not&#xD;
sweet here ? I am in love with this&#xD;
garden ! I do not know why we&#xD;
Italians do not- come here oftener.&#xD;
We leave all our prettiest spots to&#xD;
foreigners, and  they have quite&#xD;
usurped our places. It is time that&#xD;
we all should join inthe Garibaldian&#xD;
chorus of " Fuori d'Italia, fuori,&#xD;
stranieri !"* And she imitated the&#xD;
little organ-grinders' voices, who are,&#xD;
perpetually singing these words.&#xD;
"You too have the. good taste to'&#xD;
know where to walk; out of the dust&#xD;
of the city and those tiresome porti-&#xD;
cos where every one is stared at by&#xD;
all the idle young officers who have&#xD;
nothing better to do than lounge&#xD;
around the cafes from morning to&#xD;
night. I am so glad we met you!"&#xD;
Now this was not true at all, and&#xD;
Camilla was true, but she felt so&#xD;
much embarrassed before Ina th~at&#xD;
she said the first thing that came&#xD;
* "O t of Italy, away, stranigers." ;&#xD;
&#xD;
into her mind. She was vexed that&#xD;
" Ina had seen her head so n]ear&#xD;
Emanuele; she would not have&#xD;
minded another so much as Ina&#xD;
but Ina always had a peculiar infi.&#xD;
ence' over her. She truly admired&#xD;
her, and she wanted Ina's friendship,&#xD;
and esteem.&#xD;
"I was sent," began Ina. "Ma.&#xD;
dame Benoni wished me to take her&#xD;
daughters out for a little change,&#xD;
Madame Benoni thought it would do&#xD;
good to her daughters to look at the&#xD;
pictures ; good morning." She looked&#xD;
up at Emanuele with an eye so cold,&#xD;
so piercingly chilling, that his fell&#xD;
before it. He bowed, and she left&#xD;
the place.&#xD;
"What is it," said Camilla, "about&#xD;
that young girl that fills me almost&#xD;
with awe ? I have never been afraid&#xD;
of any one, but there is something&#xD;
about Mademoiselle Strohling that&#xD;
makes me feel almost timid at times,&#xD;
I am always wondering whether or&#xD;
no she likes me, and I want her to&#xD;
like, to love me, she is so lovely&#xD;
herself. But was it not very awk-&#xD;
ward, Emanuele?    .Confess, man of&#xD;
the world as you are, that you too&#xD;
felt the embarrassment of our posi.&#xD;
tion. Well, I do not care," be said,&#xD;
looking up at him. "I have had a&#xD;
happy morning, and no one can rob&#xD;
me of that."&#xD;
Hedid not answer.&#xD;
" I believe you are afraid of Mad-&#xD;
emoiselle Strohling, too. One thing&#xD;
I am sure of, that she .will not tell&#xD;
Marcello, or any one else, that she&#xD;
saw us here. Do speak, Emanuele,&#xD;
and tell me something."&#xD;
" I can tell you nothing," he said,&#xD;
"'that you do not know already1--&#xD;
&#xD;
that I love you,"-words that you&#xD;
have heard from hundreds of lips."&#xD;
"Yes," she said, blushing, "but&#xD;
that I have never before listened to&#xD;
with pleasure."&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
u     WE had a delightful time !"&#xD;
said the young girls, as they&#xD;
entered their mother's parlor with&#xD;
Mademoiselle Str5hling. " The pic-&#xD;
tures were so beautiful; and whom&#xD;
do you think we met ?"&#xD;
"I think Madame Benoni is tired,"&#xD;
said Ina, hastily; "perhaps it would&#xD;
be better to go to your rooms now,&#xD;
and take off your bonnets."&#xD;
"No," said 1 dame Benoni, "I&#xD;
am not at, all tired. I may say that&#xD;
this is one of the few days during&#xD;
which I have felt remarkably well,&#xD;
quite like a young girl! It is very&#xD;
seldom that my.daughters' voices do&#xD;
not fall on my nerves. To-day I may&#xD;
say I feel very free from all nervous&#xD;
excitement. Who was it, my dears,&#xD;
that you saw ?"&#xD;
"Why, just as we went to walk out&#xD;
in the gardens, a gentleman followed&#xD;
Mademoiselle Strohling, and we&#xD;
turned into a' side path, and there'sat&#xD;
Monsieur Bertani and. Madame de&#xD;
Turenne close to him! They seemed&#xD;
quite frightened when they saw us !&#xD;
"It is just as'I thought," said Ma-&#xD;
dame Benoni, smiling to herself. "I&#xD;
alwys said it would be so, and when&#xD;
I say a thing will be so, it always is."&#xD;
"Will you permit me," said Ina,&#xD;
"to withdraw to my room?"&#xD;
"Certainly, my dear," and Ina&#xD;
&#xD;
97&#xD;
&#xD;
went to her room. Her mind would&#xD;
form no other thought save that she&#xD;
must go to him, that she must see&#xD;
him  alone. She had been now at&#xD;
Madame Benoni's four months, and&#xD;
she had never seen him alone but&#xD;
twice in all that time; she must&#xD;
speak to him now or 'die. Her heart&#xD;
felt scarce one throb of pain, it seemed&#xD;
so turned to marble; only every time&#xD;
she breathed it went into a gasp.&#xD;
But how could she get an excuse to&#xD;
go out alone ? No young girl in Italy&#xD;
is allowed to walk alone, and although&#xD;
Ina's position as a governess made it&#xD;
very different for her, yet she was so&#xD;
young and so attractive in her ap-&#xD;
pearance that Madame Benoni had&#xD;
made that one of the points of the&#xD;
contract when Ina first came to her.&#xD;
Sometimes she went, though very&#xD;
rarely alone, with the demoiselles&#xD;
Benoni; but what could she do with&#xD;
them whilst she was at Bertani's, -&#xD;
and Adeiheide's unfortunate speech&#xD;
that a young man had followed Ina,&#xD;
she feared, would make the difficulties&#xD;
more insuperable than ever. Dinner-&#xD;
time came, and she was ever saying&#xD;
to herself, "How shall I see him ?&#xD;
how shall I get to him ?" She saw&#xD;
Marcello looking anxiously at her ;&#xD;
she averted her face to avoid his&#xD;
eye. Suddenly she thought, " He&#xD;
could help me," and then she shrank&#xD;
again from the thought of confiding&#xD;
any part of her secret to him; he&#xD;
would imagine something, and that&#xD;
must not be. The evening came and&#xD;
brought not Bertani. Madame Be-&#xD;
noni remarked his absence with a&#xD;
smile. Ina embroidered all the even-&#xD;
ing without once raising her -eyes ;&#xD;
nervously her hands flew over the~&#xD;

canvas; she never once spoke. At&#xD;
last, just as Madame Benoni was go-&#xD;
ing to retire for the night, with burn-&#xD;
ing face and hands as cold as marble&#xD;
she -said, " Madame Benoni, may I,&#xD;
might I, have the' coach- to go and&#xD;
see a friend to-morrow, a German&#xD;
lady, who has just arrived ?" It was&#xD;
true that Ina had a friend in town,'&#xD;
but she was too utterly wretched at&#xD;
heart to think of visiting any one.&#xD;
Two years ago, Ina would have&#xD;
thought it terrible to tell anything&#xD;
that was not strictly true, but now&#xD;
all was changed. "I have gone,"&#xD;
she said to herself, "from one eva-&#xD;
sion to another until there is no&#xD;
more truth in me ! I am fast becom-&#xD;
ing as she is; she said she was glad&#xD;
to see me this morning, when she&#xD;
wished me miles away!"&#xD;
"Certainly, my dear, you can have&#xD;
it at any hour; it would be unjust to&#xD;
refuse it to you, since it is the first&#xD;
time you have ever asked it for your-&#xD;
self since you came to the house !"&#xD;
"I feel grateful to you," said Ina,&#xD;
earnestly.&#xD;
That night she passed much as she&#xD;
had the last ; once or twice, in her.&#xD;
utter exhaustion, she threw herself&#xD;
on the bed and closed her eyes,&#xD;
and suddenly the blood would rush&#xD;
up to her brow, her heart would beat&#xD;
so that she would spring from the,&#xD;
bed and begin again her weary&#xD;
pacing up and down. "I am so&#xD;
tired of suffering," she would say,&#xD;
"and to think that it must ever be&#xD;
thus ! no change, ever this agony of&#xD;
heart ! Ormy God.!" .&#xD;
The dull day broke again on Tna.&#xD;
It was a comfort to see its dawn ; slhe&#xD;
should see rhim; ,not that that was&#xD;
&#xD;
anything of joy to her now, but it&#xD;
would be a comfort for once to un.&#xD;
chain her heart, to tell him all her&#xD;
scorn and bitterness of soul. The car.&#xD;
riage was ordered at twelve, and lha&#xD;
after dressing herself carefully, so as,&#xD;
to avoid all observation from Madame&#xD;
Benoni, left the house ; she drove to&#xD;
a street near his apartment, and then&#xD;
she got out and turned the corner&#xD;
telling John to wait for her until she&#xD;
came. What if, after all, Emanuele&#xD;
should not be in!   She mounted the&#xD;
few  stairs that led to his residence,&#xD;
she saw his name written on the&#xD;
brass plate, she rang the bell; a young&#xD;
man-waiter came to the door. Ina&#xD;
could not speak, she made a sign and&#xD;
passed in; the man opened the door&#xD;
of his master's sitting-room, and then&#xD;
shut the door.    Ma' sat down; she&#xD;
could ' scarcely breathe. She looked&#xD;
unconsciously around ; everything in&#xD;
the room was in perfect taste, there&#xD;
was an air of bachelor luxury about&#xD;
it which must have struck any one&#xD;
Embroidered cushions, embroidered&#xD;
cigar-cases beautifully mounted, em-,&#xD;
broidered letter-receivers and port.&#xD;
folios, showed that fair hands had&#xD;
been busied for him. A portrait of&#xD;
himself -hung above the sofa, the&#xD;
breast covered with decorations; it&#xD;
was a gift of homage from some young&#xD;
artist.  The table was covered with&#xD;
books, cigar-holders, etc., and therein'&#xD;
the' midst of all, was an exquisite&#xD;
miniature standing, - yes, it was Ca.&#xD;
milla's. There stood her rival before&#xD;
her face in glowing colors; her cheek'&#xD;
was not paled by neglect and be.&#xD;
trayal;, she was newly, freshly happy,&#xD;
Ina envied her with a great pang of&#xD;
jealousy that she thought she had&#xD;
&#xD;
crushed quite down; now it rankled&#xD;
there anew. She took the picture in&#xD;
her hand and looked closely at it.&#xD;
As she sat thus; the door opened and&#xD;
Monsieur Bertani came in. He - did&#xD;
not see who it was at once, for her{&#xD;
head was bent and her veil had fallen&#xD;
over her face.  Hearing   the  door&#xD;
close, she looked up.  Bertani started&#xD;
slightly, and became a shade paler&#xD;
than he was.&#xD;
"Ina," he  said, "why    are you&#xD;
here?"&#xD;
She rose and stood proudly before&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"I am here," she said, " because I&#xD;
am your wife, because your home is&#xD;
my home, and my rights, are here.&#xD;
I have come to claim those rights.&#xD;
I have come to claim my title as&#xD;
your lawful wife, and I stir not from&#xD;
here until it is accorded'to me. Give&#xD;
me your name for your boy's sake ;&#xD;
for my own I care not. You must&#xD;
stand now openly before the world,&#xD;
what you are, no more concealments.&#xD;
So long as I thought it for your&#xD;
good and for your country's, in my&#xD;
weakness, for love of you, I was&#xD;
silent; now all is past.  I, have seen'&#xD;
you look at another as no married&#xD;
man has a right to do ; but you are&#xD;
free, free to find what love you may,&#xD;
only it shall be openly as my de-&#xD;
clared husband, not hidden under a&#xD;
false life. Go forth in your colors as&#xD;
you are, but do not hide them like a&#xD;
coward, and win in the open field&#xD;
what victories you can!  I gave you&#xD;
my promise of secrecy once. I take&#xD;
back that promise; it was an unholy&#xD;
one. 'Before all the world I will say&#xD;
you are my husband ! your name is&#xD;
mine, Emanuele Bertani!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"You cannot bear my name, Ina,"&#xD;
he said slowly, and looking her fix-&#xD;
edly in the face.&#xD;
"Because it has fallen so low ?"&#xD;
she said scornfully. " I will yet&#xD;
stoop to pick it up, for my son's&#xD;
sake."&#xD;
No, Ina, because it is not yours&#xD;
to bear, nor yet your son's."&#xD;
"It is a lie," she said, growing&#xD;
scarlet, - " a wicked lie !"&#xD;
He caught her by the arm. "It is&#xD;
no lie," he said calmly; "listen. I&#xD;
went to Switzerland, - Lucerne, -&#xD;
and married you, if you remember&#xD;
rightly, fifteen months ago ; it was in&#xD;
the Protestant church, by a Protes-&#xD;
tant clergyman, that the ceremony&#xD;
was performed. - I am a Catholic by&#xD;
birth and baptism, you are a Protes-&#xD;
tant ; a marriage thus made is null&#xD;
and void, it has no legal right save&#xD;
when confirmed by the Pope, the&#xD;
King, or the Consul. This confirma-&#xD;
tion has never taken place. I am&#xD;
not your husband, you are not my&#xD;
wife,; no court of justice can make&#xD;
you so."&#xD;
"Say that again," said Ina, looking&#xD;
blankly at him, - " say that again."&#xD;
" I have said that you are not my&#xD;
wife, our marriage was illegal; to be&#xD;
man and wife, we should have to&#xD;
be married again, as much 'as-if such&#xD;
a ceremony never had been per-&#xD;
formed before. I swear it you, on&#xD;
my honor, that what I say is true."&#xD;
"You hold yourself then free ?"&#xD;
she said, glaring at him. fiercely.&#xD;
Emanuele quailed before that look;&#xD;
It was no longer Ina's face he saw,&#xD;
before him - that sweet, still face ;&#xD;
now, every passion chasing itself&#xD;
across it, it was wild, and fierce;&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC8231-00000052"/>&#xD;
INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
it was like nature on a summer's&#xD;
day, when gll is calm and silent, and&#xD;
suddenly the tempest sweeps over it&#xD;
rendering all one mad commotion&#xD;
of the elements. Emanuele folded&#xD;
his arms before Ina and stood look-&#xD;
ing at her.&#xD;
"Do you mean that you are free,&#xD;
that you hold me as a cast-off mis-&#xD;
tress, of whose monotonous charms&#xD;
you are weary, and your son as your&#xD;
bastard ? Do you mean that you&#xD;
meant to deceive me even from the&#xD;
fist ? " she said, her voice suddenly&#xD;
changing from its sharp harshness&#xD;
to a low moan. "0 God, I do not&#xD;
see clearly," putting her hands over&#xD;
her eyes; then, rushing up to him,&#xD;
she caught hold of his arm, and said,&#xD;
wildly : " Tell me that you are de-&#xD;
ceiving ine now, and I will forgive&#xD;
all your jest. I will pardon all this&#xD;
agony of pain you have caused me.&#xD;
I will fall on my knees before you,&#xD;
and love .you still, and pray for you,&#xD;
and bless you, and die for you, if you&#xD;
do not love me, and leave yon free !&#xD;
Tell me that, speak, clear yourself !&#xD;
0 God, no word ! , Say, 'Ina, I love&#xD;
another. I loved you once, but that&#xD;
is over now. I cannot enslave my&#xD;
heart. I an your husband, but my&#xD;
heart is free; that was another's be-&#xD;
fore I was myself aware of it.' 0&#xD;
speak!" She almost screamed.&#xD;
Emanuele stood silent before her;&#xD;
what could he say?&#xD;
"Then you never loved me," she&#xD;
said, " no, not even from the first,"-&#xD;
as if speaking to herself, -"all those&#xD;
sweet hours were false ; he waskmock-'&#xD;
ing me; he was taking my heart in&#xD;
his hands, and pulling it to bits, as&#xD;
he would the leaves of a flower, until&#xD;
&#xD;
the chalice was bare ; b t what care&#xD;
I I for the .past ? he mus answer to&#xD;
me now for the future. Ah nono&#xD;
fiend could commit such a deed! I&#xD;
I was so innocent, so young and trust.&#xD;
ing. I loved him   so. I gave him&#xD;
all!"&#xD;
"Ina," he said, "you are not my&#xD;
wife, but yet -"&#xD;
She .drew herself up before him,&#xD;
and said slowly : "I am your wife,&#xD;
Emanuele Bertani! I am your wife,&#xD;
- before God I am, yes, and before&#xD;
man too, when he knows your treach-&#xD;
ery ; nor God nor man will give you&#xD;
your freedom, only my death can&#xD;
make you free; you know it, and&#xD;
beware how you take one step to-&#xD;
wards that freedom. I care not save&#xD;
for my child, our child. Ah, what a&#xD;
curse that sounds to me now! Tell&#xD;
me that you hold yourself bound to&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"I cannot do that, Ina, for, as I&#xD;
told you, I am free."&#xD;
" 0 God !" she said, in utter de-&#xD;
spair ; then she went up to him and,&#xD;
looking him imploringly in the face,&#xD;
said, " Emanuele, I have no promise&#xD;
to you now which- binds me, but&#xD;
promise me that you will hold your-&#xD;
self bound to me, and I promise you&#xD;
that I will never see you'more, that&#xD;
I will still keep your secret, as I&#xD;
have kept it up to this time, - it is&#xD;
the only grace I ask of you;-if not, I&#xD;
will proclaim openly to all the world&#xD;
your shame. This is the last sacrifice&#xD;
I can make for my child !"&#xD;
" You have my word," he said;&#xD;
unow leave me"&#xD;
Ina paused, and gave him one last&#xD;
look ; all the. love of the past and&#xD;
present hatred seemed to struggle in&#xD;
&#xD;
that long, fixed gaze. "I loved you&#xD;
once," she said ; and she turned and&#xD;
glided out of the room.&#xD;
Ina was going to leave Madame&#xD;
Benoni's, but she had not yet spoken&#xD;
to her. She had not yet revealed to&#xD;
Marcello her decision to leave them.&#xD;
She did not any longer know her-&#xD;
self; she seemed to herself turned to&#xD;
stone, she felt no sensation any&#xD;
more, she was stunned and be-&#xD;
numbed. She often used to say to&#xD;
herself, "My blood has ceased to run&#xD;
in my veins. I am    all cold and&#xD;
hard. I feel nothing,.no sense of&#xD;
life,"-and this was the most dread-&#xD;
ful sensation of all. "He called me&#xD;
Pygmalion's statue once, but that was&#xD;
marble turning to flesh. But I am&#xD;
flesh turning back to marble. My&#xD;
limbs are so heavy that it hurts me&#xD;
to lift them, and I -cannot think at&#xD;
all. I believe my memory is going.&#xD;
I cannot"remember when I went to&#xD;
him, yetI did go !"  A week passed&#xD;
thus, and Bertani never visited the&#xD;
Benonis again. Ina lingered, too,&#xD;
around the spot, with a feeling that&#xD;
if she were there she could ward off&#xD;
some strange evil that was to come,&#xD;
--it did not take a definite shape,&#xD;
--but some last terrible blow that&#xD;
was reserved for her by the hand&#xD;
of destiny. Ina had not seen Ma-&#xD;
dame de Turenne since that morn-&#xD;
ing she had met her at the public&#xD;
gardens. Where was she ? What&#xD;
was she doing now ? - There was&#xD;
to be a great bal costume  et 'rnasqu,&#xD;
given by  the   Comtesse   Jdrome.&#xD;
She was a very wealthy and fash-&#xD;
ionable woman who had come to&#xD;
Turin to pass the winter after hav-&#xD;
ing grown weary of the cream of&#xD;
&#xD;
Parisian . life ; she thought it was&#xD;
well to choose a new -field for her&#xD;
charms, and she had decided to daz-&#xD;
zle Turin with her splendor,-Turin,&#xD;
the capital and court of Italy. She&#xD;
and Madame de Turenne had been&#xD;
the reigning and rival belles all&#xD;
winter. The Benonis -had received&#xD;
cards for, the ball* and so had Ina,&#xD;
for Madame Jerome had seen Ina&#xD;
the night that she was at the opera&#xD;
with  Madame    de Turenne, had&#xD;
looked at her for a long .time with&#xD;
her lorgnon, and had declared, in&#xD;
spite of her being in Madame Be-&#xD;
noni's .house in the capacity of a&#xD;
governess, that she.was "bien gentille,&#xD;
vraiment charmante, et qu'elle avait&#xD;
l'air noble !" Madame Benoni, of&#xD;
course, was not going, and naturally&#xD;
Ina had not been consulted as to&#xD;
whether she would go or no. She&#xD;
and, Madame Benoni were sitting in&#xD;
her boudoir when the door was&#xD;
thrown open and Madame de Tu-&#xD;
renne was announced.. There was&#xD;
no escape now for Ina. Ina looked&#xD;
at her ; she was charming. No&#xD;
change had come over her beauty;&#xD;
she looked more brilliant than ever.&#xD;
"0, how glad I am to see you!"&#xD;
said Madame de Turenne. "It is&#xD;
such ages since I have been here,&#xD;
and yet there is not a day that I&#xD;
have not thought of you. Why have&#xD;
you not been to see me, Mademoi-&#xD;
selle Ina ? I heard that you were&#xD;
out in the coach, quite alone, the&#xD;
other day. I was really hurt that it&#xD;
was not to see me."&#xD;
* Ina said, quietly, that she had&#xD;
gone out to see -a friend from her&#xD;
own country.&#xD;
" Indeed," said Madame die Tu-&#xD;
&#xD;

"Are you going to the grand masked mounting for me; the neck will bel&#xD;

of any consequence that is discussed have my hair braided with pearls,&#xD;

are quite secondary to Madame la head !'&#xD;
Comtesse de Jdrome's ball."          "You will look beautiful," said&#xD;
"No," said Madame Benoni, "you Ina.&#xD;
know I never go where there is a     "Thank you for the' compliment,&#xD;
crush ! my nerves will not stand a but, above all, I do not wish Marcello&#xD;

"I wish," :said Madame de Tu- least to be discreet. It is something,&#xD;
renne, "that Mademoiselle Ina would after so many years of close study, -&#xD;
be persuaded .to go with me. You is it not?"&#xD;
have lent her to me once, Madame "It is much," said Ina.&#xD;
Benoni. I was a most trustworthy     " Last year my friend Nina Gual.&#xD;
matron. Would you not like to go, terio had a duel fought about her.&#xD;
Mademoiselle Ina ?"               She had encouraged -one gentleman&#xD;
"No, I thank you," said Ina. "I under her mask, never dreaming that&#xD;
do not care about it at all; indeed; he knew who she was. Then when&#xD;
I would much rather not go ; you he told her he knew her, and called her&#xD;
are very kind."               .   by her name, she grew cold, and, per-&#xD;
" How are you going to be dressed, ceiving that he was too persistent in.&#xD;
my dear?" said Madame Benoni.     his declarations, she took the arm of&#xD;
"It is a great secret, but I will tell another friend who was passing, and&#xD;
you if you will reveal it to no one, went off with him. When her hus-&#xD;

that hour. I am, going as Frangesca them badly wounded; they fought&#xD;
&#xD;
with sabres as usual, and at the first&#xD;
scratch that drew blood they shook&#xD;
hands and retired from, the field.&#xD;
Still, such things are far from agree-&#xD;
able. Nina is very conscientious, and&#xD;
she felt it deeply. I think duelling&#xD;
such a miserable custom in our coun-&#xD;
try, and it springs, I believe, from&#xD;
the root of all evil here, -idleness.&#xD;
Marcello says they are not so terrible&#xD;
as those in America, where they fight&#xD;
with pistols at ten paces. But those&#xD;
are duels to some purpose. Here, if&#xD;
a man treads on. another's foot, or&#xD;
looks at the lady he loves, or brushes&#xD;
the one on his arm accidentally as&#xD;
he passes, there must immediately&#xD;
be satisfaction demanded for his&#xD;
wounded honor."&#xD;
"Where is Marcello ?" said Ma-&#xD;
dame Benoni. " I have not seen him&#xD;
to-day?" .&#xD;
"I do not know," said Ina, looking&#xD;
vacantly at Madame de Turenne,&#xD;
"Why," said Camilla, laughing,&#xD;
"were you afraid -he had gone to&#xD;
fight a duel ? There is no danger of&#xD;
that. Marcello is invincible ; he has a&#xD;
sang-froid that nothing can move,&#xD;
and a temper so good that no one&#xD;
can anger him; is it not so, Madem-&#xD;
oiselle Ina?"&#xD;
"I believe so," said poor Ina. She&#xD;
wished so much that Madame de1&#xD;
Turenne would go, and leave her in&#xD;
peace. There she stood so calm, and&#xD;
she felt every moment as if she must&#xD;
turn and tell her how she hated her !&#xD;
She looked at her lips, and wondered&#xD;
if they had ever felt the pressure of&#xD;
Emanuele's upon them. Ah, why&#xD;
could she not drop dead at her rival's&#xD;
feet, and sleep forever, and forget ?&#xD;
"Good morning," said Madame de t&#xD;
&#xD;
Turenne. "I will come and tell you&#xD;
all about the evening, if you wish it."&#xD;
" Is Monsieur Bertani to be there ?"&#xD;
said Madame Benoni. " He has quite&#xD;
abandoned us ; but that is the way&#xD;
with friends, you know !"&#xD;
Madame de Turenne blushed -&#xD;
how dared she in Ina's presence ?-&#xD;
and said, "Yes, he told me that he&#xD;
-should most certainly go."&#xD;
" You are turning his head, my&#xD;
dear," said Madame Benoni.&#xD;
"A statesman's head is too firmly,&#xD;
put on," she said, laughing. "I think&#xD;
it would be better worth while to&#xD;
turn his heart if one could, but I&#xD;
have begun to doubt whether that is&#xD;
an article in the possession of anyi&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"Well, my dear, I must confess&#xD;
that that is a strange argument for&#xD;
you to make use of."&#xD;
"Indeed," she said, with a slight'&#xD;
petulance in her tone, like a spoiled&#xD;
child that has been thwarted for&#xD;
the first time, "I believe what I&#xD;
say is true ; men say a great many&#xD;
things which create feeling in women,&#xD;
but I doubt if it does not all end in&#xD;
smoke with them, when the fire has&#xD;
already burnt into the victim of their&#xD;
vanity."&#xD;
" You are severe in your judgment&#xD;
this morning."&#xD;
"I am   cross and out of humor.&#xD;
Farewell!" and she left the-room.&#xD;
That night, vhen Ina went to bed, a&#xD;
sudden thought flashed over her, that&#xD;
she too must go to this ball. There,hid-&#xD;
den under her mask, she could stand&#xD;
apart, and watch Madame de Turenne&#xD;
and Emanuele. The more she thought.&#xD;
of it, the more determined she felt&#xD;
,hat she must go, how she knew not;&#xD;
&#xD;
,&#xD;
&#xD;
INA.                        . 103&#xD;

104                         INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
but this idea had taken possession&#xD;
of her"mind, and she lay awake all&#xD;
night, her cheeks burning with the&#xD;
fever that was on her, revolving some&#xD;
possible plan to escape from the&#xD;
house on the evening of the ball.&#xD;
She knew now what Madame de. Tu-&#xD;
renne's dress would be, but that mat-&#xD;
tered not, ,she would have known&#xD;
her, however masked ! She must go,.&#xD;
she would stand near her, she would&#xD;
watch his face when he did not&#xD;
know that her eye was upon him,&#xD;
she would snatch from him the very&#xD;
secret of his soul when he dreamed&#xD;
not that she was near. During the&#xD;
next few days that elapsed she had&#xD;
no rest from this thought ; she would&#xD;
see them once more together when&#xD;
they knew not that her eye rested&#xD;
upon them! then she would go to&#xD;
" her boy, and hide herself with him for-&#xD;
ever in her misery. She would pray&#xD;
God day and night to take them both&#xD;
away from this world Of sorrow. Per-&#xD;
haps he would listen to her prayer,&#xD;
she was so young to have suffered so&#xD;
much, and she had never willingly&#xD;
done any wrong; and then the baby&#xD;
was so innocent, 'how could shame&#xD;
and grief be visited upon him ! That&#xD;
would make God unjust, and he was&#xD;
ever our Heavenly Father ; he would&#xD;
not refuse them that last mercy.&#xD;
Rest, rest," said Ina, leaning her head&#xD;
against her hand, "that is all I ask&#xD;
now ; but could I rest if I could not&#xD;
forget? 0, does God not mean, when&#xD;
we go into another world, to give us&#xD;
oblivion of our past ? and how can we&#xD;
preserve our identity, and yet erase&#xD;
all that has wrung our souls on&#xD;
earth ? No, I must cease to re-&#xD;
memnber who I have been, and yet&#xD;
&#xD;
have my boy in my arms; feeling&#xD;
only his love, and knowing, not&#xD;
whence he came, I may still be my.&#xD;
self; that will not be annihilation. I&#xD;
can be as I was when a young gi,&#xD;
with my mother's spirit, and my fa-&#xD;
ther and Wilhelm, Soil and my&#xD;
boy ; then Sofi and I will call him&#xD;
our child, and he will have two&#xD;
mothers, and we will love him so&#xD;
that he will forget to ask for his&#xD;
father."&#xD;
The day came of the grand soire&#xD;
and Ina passed it in nervous restless-&#xD;
ness. She could not fix her mind far&#xD;
a moment on anything, she started&#xD;
if any one spoke to her, she trembled&#xD;
if she heard a voice. 1Warcello per-&#xD;
ceived it; nothing that concerned&#xD;
Ina ever went unnoticed by him. At&#xD;
eight o'clock -in the evening she'&#xD;
called the servant Katerina, Ma-&#xD;
dame Benoni's especial' maid, to her,&#xD;
and said: "Katerina, do not go to&#xD;
bed to-night at the usual hour ; wait&#xD;
until I come for you, it may be very&#xD;
late; try and get all the servants to.&#xD;
retire at an earlier hour, if possible,&#xD;
than is customary., I am going to&#xD;
ask a great favor of you, but I have&#xD;
known you always so good and true&#xD;
to your mistress, that I am sure you&#xD;
will not fail he ; and remember that&#xD;
you repeat not one word that I have&#xD;
told you."&#xD;
"I have lived here twelve years,&#xD;
Mademoiselle, and you may trust&#xD;
me as you would your mother; call&#xD;
me when you are ready for me."&#xD;
na sat with Madame Benomn un-&#xD;
til ten o'clock. 0, how terribly tong&#xD;
the minutes seemed ! She listened&#xD;
acutely to the ticking of the clock,&#xD;
the time would not pass; then she&#xD;
&#xD;
went to her room, and sat with her&#xD;
watch in her hand until eleven; then&#xD;
she rose hastily and blew out her&#xD;
candles, then went stealthily to the&#xD;
door, and, opening it slightly, lis-&#xD;
tened breathlessly to the sounds in&#xD;
the house. All was silent, save that&#xD;
she could hear a tread, from time to&#xD;
tine, in Marcello's room; a gleam of&#xD;
light shone from under his door. At&#xD;
last he opened it so suddenly that Ina&#xD;
had but just time to draw back be-&#xD;
fore he passed her room; she could&#xD;
see by the light that streamed from&#xD;
his chamber that he was in full dress.&#xD;
He paused a moment when he came&#xD;
to where she was. Ina's heart beat&#xD;
so loud, she was afraid he had heard&#xD;
it; then he passed by, and she heard&#xD;
him open the door and go down&#xD;
stairs. It was eleven o'clock. She&#xD;
stole out of her room, along the&#xD;
entry, past 'Madame Benoni's, to&#xD;
Katerina's room.&#xD;
"Come," she said, in a trembling&#xD;
whisper, "come quickly !" Katerina&#xD;
followed Ina. Ina shut her door noise-&#xD;
lessly, and then, taking hold of Ka-&#xD;
teeina's arm, said: "Katerina, you&#xD;
must trust me. I would not do a&#xD;
wrong thing, but you are the only&#xD;
person in the world who can render&#xD;
me a service. I must go to the ball&#xD;
to-night. I must go unknown to any&#xD;
one. You will have to go out qui-&#xD;
etly and get me a carriage, just on&#xD;
the place; they are always there at all.&#xD;
hours. I will dress in the mean time ;&#xD;
I need no help. Then you must wait&#xD;
up for me until one o'clock ; I may&#xD;
he a little later. You must not go to&#xD;
sleep for one moinent, but stand&#xD;
watching from my window until I I&#xD;
come, and then open the door for me.&#xD;
&#xD;
Here," she said, putting a fifty-franc&#xD;
piece into her hand, "this is not to&#xD;
bribe you, Katerina, but I cannot bear&#xD;
to ask a service that I may not re-&#xD;
pay."&#xD;
"Believe me, Mademoiselle, it is&#xD;
not for your money, but because I&#xD;
love you, that I would be willing to&#xD;
do anything for you!1"&#xD;
"Then go, Katerina, quick, for&#xD;
God's sake !"&#xD;
Katerina went silently out of the&#xD;
room, along the entry, and Ina heard&#xD;
her too shut the door and turn the&#xD;
key ; then she began to dress herself&#xD;
with trembling hands. She put on&#xD;
her white silk that she had worn at&#xD;
Madame de Turenne's. Nobody would&#xD;
know it, for it was plain. She took&#xD;
out a white bournous that her brother&#xD;
had brought her from Constantinople,&#xD;
and which she had never worn, - it&#xD;
was made of white camel's hair, and&#xD;
fell gracefully in ample folds all&#xD;
around her,   and a white satin mask,&#xD;
that she had bought the last winter,&#xD;
but had never worn. She was all&#xD;
rehdy just as she heard Katernia en-&#xD;
ter the door again.&#xD;
" The carriage is there, Mademoi-&#xD;
selle ; you look like a beautiful&#xD;
spirit."                             -&#xD;
Ina drew the hood up over her&#xD;
head, so that it covered all her hair,&#xD;
even low down on the brow, took her&#xD;
white glovs in her hand, and then&#xD;
said hastily, "0, my ticket'! my head&#xD;
turns ; if I had forgotten that !" The&#xD;
large 'card invitation, requesting all&#xD;
those who were invited to present-it&#xD;
at the door, was soon found, and Ina&#xD;
glided out of her room, down stairs,&#xD;
into the carriage which was awaiting&#xD;
hier.&#xD;
&#xD;
INA.                           105&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC8231-00000055"/>&#xD;
106                           INA,&#xD;
&#xD;
"Take me to 47 Rue Ctvour," said&#xD;
Ina, "where the Countess Jdrome&#xD;
gives her great costume ball to-night,'&#xD;
and the coachman drove off. Ina&#xD;
took up the card and unconsciously&#xD;
her eye fell on it; she saw now in&#xD;
large letters, by the light of the&#xD;
coachman's candle, that no lady would&#xD;
be admitted without a cavalier; the&#xD;
blood eddied to her head so that she&#xD;
could not think, but she knew only&#xD;
one thing, that go she -would now at&#xD;
all hazards. The carriage went so&#xD;
fast that she feared to arrive before&#xD;
she could collect her mind. It&#xD;
stopped. Shrieks of " Take care !"&#xD;
"Don't run me down!1" "]Back&#xD;
there !" met her ear. She looked-&#xD;
out; there were crowds of people&#xD;
collected thronging the- street, to see&#xD;
what little they could of the show.&#xD;
Ina was terrified. The coachman&#xD;
opened the door.&#xD;
"Here we are, Madame; it is a&#xD;
pity you 're alone."&#xD;
" Tell me where you will be,'I&#xD;
said Ina, "precisely at a quarter to&#xD;
one. I will give you fifty francs for&#xD;
your fee if you will be there punctu-&#xD;
ally, and not keep me waiting a sec-&#xD;
ond."&#xD;
The man's face was illuminated at&#xD;
the thought of such a night's good&#xD;
fortune ; all made, too, in less than&#xD;
a couple of hours.&#xD;
"Look opposite, just down at that&#xD;
corner, Madame ; there may be- a&#xD;
crush here, so you just cross the street&#xD;
a little lower down, where that apoth-&#xD;
ecary's sign is, and I will be there,&#xD;
with a white piece of paper stuck in&#xD;
my hat, so you will know me the&#xD;
monient you see me !" --&#xD;
" Yes," 'said Ina, " and you look&#xD;
&#xD;
for me too ; remember I am all in&#xD;
white."&#xD;
He touched his hat, and drove off.&#xD;
tIna passed swiftly through the press&#xD;
of people.   " She 's the only one&#xD;
who    is  alon,"  some  one  said.&#xD;
" Why, she can't get in; what is she&#xD;
alone for ?" said another. "Hush,"&#xD;
said another, "perhaps it is a man in&#xD;
disguise, and he may give you a&#xD;
knock for your insolence!"     "Ha,&#xD;
ha, ha!, " laughed two or three, "a&#xD;
man, and walk so graceful as that;&#xD;
ten to one, I'llb et it 's a woman!"&#xD;
"Let's see, let 's see," shouted a third.&#xD;
Ina was so terrified that she&#xD;
thought. she should fall; and, fall&#xD;
amongst that crowd, what would be-&#xD;
come of her ?   But some one said,&#xD;
"Here 's the gendarme, take care&#xD;
what you do !"    And she hurried&#xD;
on ; now she was in the portico, she&#xD;
stopped a second to lean against it;&#xD;
then on she went up the marble&#xD;
stairs, amongst livery servants who&#xD;
stared at her. The stairs were lined&#xD;
on each side with flowers that gave&#xD;
out a delicious fragrance ; the lights&#xD;
were hidden amongst them, so that&#xD;
it seemed as if they themselves&#xD;
sprang from the flowers. On she&#xD;
passed up to the top, where stood a&#xD;
man looking like an official, with a&#xD;
gilt order around his neck. There&#xD;
were several persons standing near&#xD;
him; some had just shown their&#xD;
cards. Ina handed him hers, but he&#xD;
said, "Pardon me, Madame, your'&#xD;
card is good, but no lady can pass&#xD;
in alone."&#xD;
"My husband just ran back," she&#xD;
said, "to get my bracelet, which I&#xD;
dropped in the coach. I feel ill;&#xD;
please let me step in."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Certainly," he said, and bowed to&#xD;
her to enter.&#xD;
She was shown to the dressing-&#xD;
room. When she left it she saw&#xD;
several fashionable young men stand-&#xD;
ing in a group; one of them.she rec-&#xD;
ognized* as having been at Madame&#xD;
de Turenne's the day of the dinner.&#xD;
It was Monsieur lufarchini.   His&#xD;
name was F4ddric, and she had heard&#xD;
Madame de Turenne     say, as she&#xD;
passed him that day, "Fede, don't&#xD;
look so down-hearted. I will flirt&#xD;
with you by and by." He moved&#xD;
aside now, and looked at her. She&#xD;
went up to him, and, slipping her,&#xD;
arm in his, changing her voice to&#xD;
that falsetto key which is used at all&#xD;
mask-balls, she said, " Fede, do you&#xD;
not know me?"&#xD;
"I only know that your figure is&#xD;
the personification of grace ; if your&#xD;
face is half so lovely, I am your&#xD;
sworn knight for life."&#xD;
"Hush," she said, "you forget your&#xD;
Cleopatra. Have you so soon for-&#xD;
sworn yourself ? You have made&#xD;
me mad with jealousy for a year,&#xD;
now it is time that I should revenge&#xD;
myself. Promise me, at least, that&#xD;
to-night you will stay by me for one&#xD;
hour, and then you* will pique her&#xD;
by letting her see you with another&#xD;
woman. And," with a deep-drawn&#xD;
sigh, "you will make me happy for a&#xD;
short time." .&#xD;
He pressed her arm to his breast,&#xD;
and said, " I would make you happy&#xD;
for always if it were in my power.&#xD;
I think I know who you are already ;&#xD;
you cannot deceive me. Are you&#xD;
then," lowering his voice, "so un-&#xD;
happy at home as they say you are ?&#xD;
* gentlemenn in Italy seldom wear masks.&#xD;
&#xD;
Poor lady ! with your beauty, to be&#xD;
so treated by a brute!"&#xD;
"Yes, I am very wretched," said&#xD;
Ina. She knew she must keep up&#xD;
her character, for she could not be&#xD;
left alone ; but her head was whirl-&#xD;
ing around; all the blood seemed to&#xD;
have rushed there, and the voices&#xD;
of the people sounded like a suc-&#xD;
cession of shrieks in her ears.&#xD;
" Come this way," she said; " this is&#xD;
the way !"  She tutoydd him, as is&#xD;
the custom when under a mask. "I&#xD;
want to find my happy rival."&#xD;
"No,leave her to her conquests,&#xD;
and leave me to my new-found&#xD;
appiness."&#xD;
" No, I must see her."&#xD;
"Could you recognize her ?"&#xD;
"Yes, by instinct."&#xD;
The music clashed out, and above&#xD;
it rose the din of high voices. Near&#xD;
Ina stood a lady dressed as Night;&#xD;
her costume was literally sown with&#xD;
diamonds, which glittered under. the&#xD;
black lace like stars. Ina turned&#xD;
sick at the words she heard a hand-&#xD;
some young officer address to her ;&#xD;
she wondered if they stirred' her&#xD;
soul, as once her own was moved by&#xD;
the words of him who had so falsely&#xD;
betrayed her. They stopped a mo-&#xD;
ment to look at the dancing; the&#xD;
whole room seemed a mad whirl of&#xD;
colors; like the bright gleams in the&#xD;
kaleidoscope, they formed and part-&#xD;
ed, met and separated again, ever in&#xD;
new figures.&#xD;
A" I have followed you for two&#xD;
months," he said in low tones, "with&#xD;
the hope of seeing you one instant&#xD;
alone. I know you under your veil,&#xD;
as the bird recognizes its particular&#xD;
branch although hidden under the&#xD;
&#xD;
mA.                          107&#xD;

INA.                          109&#xD;
&#xD;
forest leaves. I dare all for you'&#xD;
sake, and you have not vouchsafed&#xD;
me one look."&#xD;
" I dared not," said the lady, ina&#xD;
tremulous voice. "I am never alone&#xD;
his sister watches me constantly, my&#xD;
husband is terribly jealous."&#xD;
"And I am madly so! I love you&#xD;
and have the first right over- you;&#xD;
do not tremble; tell me if, you will&#xD;
meet m  at -" Ina did not hear&#xD;
where--" to-morrow?"&#xD;
"Yes," said the lady, in a low&#xD;
voice. " I have no longer a will of&#xD;
my own."&#xD;
" I know -you, I know you," shout-&#xD;
ed a gentleman; "even the darkness&#xD;
of night cannot conceal you from&#xD;
me;i thus shrouded, you are as be-&#xD;
witching as everi"&#xD;
" Are you weary ?" said Monsieur&#xD;
Marchini to Ina.,. " Lean upon my&#xD;
arm more heavily. I do not even&#xD;
feel you; it is sweet to have that&#xD;
little hand fluttering so near my&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
" Will you allow me your partner&#xD;
for a turn, Marchini ? "&#xD;
"She does not dance, and, if she&#xD;
did, I would not part with her."&#xD;
" Marchini is always very exclu-&#xD;
sive," said another, laughing; "he&#xD;
chooses well."&#xD;
"Yes, he has good taste. I dare say&#xD;
that 's the ballerina that he has been&#xD;
courting all winter that he has got&#xD;
under his arm ; he said she did not&#xD;
dance to put us off the scent ; he has&#xD;
kept her shut up close for months,&#xD;
so that a fellow could not get a peep&#xD;
.at her when off the stage ; you '1l see&#xD;
that when unmasking time comes&#xD;
she ,will suddenly disappear. I&#xD;
caught a glimpse of her foot ; it is as&#xD;
&#xD;
r small as those flowers they call ladies'.&#xD;
d slippers ; let us keep close to them,&#xD;
and see where they will go."&#xD;
a " No, no, I do not want to get into&#xD;
trouble- with Marchini; he 's a fiery&#xD;
fellow, and there is no telling what&#xD;
he might do. I amn going after that&#xD;
little imp inred."&#xD;
;   Two pilgrims passed, in long white&#xD;
l dresses, with red crosses. on their&#xD;
breasts.&#xD;
" Where are you bound, gentle&#xD;
pilgrims ? to Holy Land ? Do not go&#xD;
-so far; you will find knights enough&#xD;
whose wounds you can heal without&#xD;
wandering   away   from   your own&#xD;
country."&#xD;
"Do not answer him," whispered&#xD;
one to the other; "he will find us&#xD;
out." They put their fingers to their&#xD;
lips, in sign that they could not&#xD;
speak.&#xD;
"Bound by a vow of silence ? My&#xD;
lady must speak to me. Bon voyage,&#xD;
fair pilgrims     -&#xD;
" 0, I shall die ! " whispered one to&#xD;
the other. " Here comes my husband;&#xD;
if he should find me out, he would&#xD;
kill me ; if he speaks to us, do not&#xD;
say one word. 0, why have we not&#xD;
met Henri before this ?" The gentle-&#xD;
man whom the lady so feared came&#xD;
nearer and nearer; she shrank behind&#xD;
her companion, he looked at them&#xD;
a moment, stopped as if he were go-,&#xD;
ing to speak, and then, apparently&#xD;
having changed his mind, passed by.&#xD;
"0, you do not think he did it on&#xD;
purpose ; 'you are sure he suspected&#xD;
nothing !"&#xD;
"What a crowd ! " said M~iarchini,&#xD;
"but it has the advantage of pressing&#xD;
you, nearer to me. I wish it were&#xD;
even greater than it is ; you tremble"'&#xD;
&#xD;
and they passed on. Now and then&#xD;
they had to stop again, because there&#xD;
was such a pressure of people. A&#xD;
lady brushed lightly by on the arm&#xD;
of 4 gentleman;' she was dressed as a&#xD;
snow-storm; her dress was made of&#xD;
folds upon folds of the softest illusion&#xD;
lace, all tufted .with little flakes of&#xD;
wool; a veil of the same fell from her&#xD;
head to her feet; around her dark&#xD;
hair, which fell down on her shoul-&#xD;
ders, was a wreath of crystals made&#xD;
like icicles, and sprays of the same&#xD;
looped her dress..&#xD;
Marchini bowed to his friend, and&#xD;
said, en passant, " You have chosen a&#xD;
cold companion."&#xD;
"Better," said the other, laughing,&#xD;
"to have her melt in my arms, than&#xD;
to own a spirit who will vanish with&#xD;
the morning light."&#xD;
Just behind was a lady in a dress&#xD;
made of many    irts of velvet, one t&#xD;
tunic over another, and  gradually&#xD;
letting their different .tints vanish&#xD;
one into the other ; the bottom skirt&#xD;
was black, that was folded    with.&#xD;
scarlet, and that with amber-colored&#xD;
yellow; a little flame of light jetted&#xD;
out from her forehead, and its con- r&#xD;
tainer was so skilfully covered with&#xD;
her hair that you knew not whence 1&#xD;
it came ;' she had a stuffed swallow  r&#xD;
on her breast, and she was fire. Be- I&#xD;
hind her, on the arm of him she was I&#xD;
luring by her charms to the kingdom s&#xD;
of love and torments and sin, was a s&#xD;
beautifully formed woman ; she wasin&#xD;
dressed in red velvet pointed at the,&#xD;
bottom, with" 'a black velvet over- i&#xD;
dress 'pointed also ; her hair was tied a&#xD;
with a little red bow, and two coral y&#xD;
horps were upon her brow.p&#xD;
Then came Semiramide, magnifi-&#xD;
&#xD;
cently dressed in an Eastern cos-&#xD;
tume; she had on a gorgeous yellow&#xD;
'satin embroidered deep with gold&#xD;
in Egyptian hieroglyphs, a blue vel-&#xD;
vet peplum,- with the same golden&#xD;
figures on it, an Egyptian crown&#xD;
of plain gold, and large African&#xD;
gold hoopsin her ears, with chains&#xD;
of Oriental pearls hanging from her&#xD;
throat.&#xD;
"If we were near Nino's tomb,"&#xD;
said a gentleman who had stepped&#xD;
around on the other side of her, "I&#xD;
could reveal a .secret to your lover&#xD;
that would make him doubt his hap-&#xD;
piness."&#xD;
"Speak it out here !" said the lady,&#xD;
laughing. He whispered in her ear;&#xD;
she uttered a low scream, and put&#xD;
out her hand as if for mercy. The&#xD;
gentleman on whose arm she was&#xD;
said angrily, "You shall answer this&#xD;
to-morrow, Barbino."&#xD;
"To-night, if you will," he an-&#xD;
swered.&#xD;
The gentleman stepped aside a mo-&#xD;
ment, and whispered with the other.&#xD;
'At eight then." They bowed stiffly,&#xD;
and he went back and offered Semi-&#xD;
'amide his arm.&#xD;
"For God's sake," Ina heard the&#xD;
ady say, in low, agitated tones, "for&#xD;
ny sake, if you love me,"-he drew&#xD;
her quickly' away.   Marchini felt&#xD;
his arm suddenly grasped convul-&#xD;
ively; they were passing through a&#xD;
mall room, which was a mere con-&#xD;
iection, as it were, of the others; there&#xD;
were two'largemarble pillars wreathed&#xD;
n flowers which formed a sort of&#xD;
,rch at the top; through these again&#xD;
~ou could see into a long vista of&#xD;
parlors beyond.&#xD;
" Go and get me some cologne,"&#xD;
&#xD;
108                        INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC8231-00000057"/>&#xD;
110                          INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
said Ina, " I feel faint; you will find&#xD;
me leaning against this pillar."&#xD;
She had caught sight of Bertani,&#xD;
and by his . side was Madame de&#xD;
Turenne ; they were just hidden&#xD;
slightly by the other pillar. Marchini&#xD;
left her, after tenderly pressing her&#xD;
hand, and she was alone, so near&#xD;
them; they were utterly unconscious&#xD;
of the presence of any one, so ear-&#xD;
nestly were they talking. Ina would&#xD;
have recognized Madame de Turenne&#xD;
by her form in any place, but she&#xD;
had on the very dress with which&#xD;
she was going to deceive all the&#xD;
world, and which she had described&#xD;
at Madame Benoni's; it was cut to,&#xD;
show her beautiful bust to the best&#xD;
advantage, her arms and neck were&#xD;
very bare, and magnificent jewels&#xD;
sparkled on them.&#xD;
"I think you the most beau-&#xD;
tiful woman I ever saw," he said,&#xD;
glancing at her with those dark&#xD;
eyes whose expression Ina knew so&#xD;
well.&#xD;
"0, do not speak to me so light-&#xD;
ly !" she said, in an entreating tone&#xD;
of voice, and she placed her beautiful&#xD;
hand on his arm; he drew it in his,&#xD;
and, pressed his lips to it. Ina saw&#xD;
the blood mantle in her neck behind&#xD;
up to her throat, from where she&#xD;
stood.&#xD;
" Cupid lies in the dimples of your&#xD;
hand," he said, " as Cardinal Retz&#xD;
used to say he did in the wrinkles&#xD;
of Ninon de l'Enclos's face ; he has&#xD;
transferred his dwelling to enviable&#xD;
places!"  ,&#xD;
" I do not care for such empty&#xD;
words," she said, letting her hand&#xD;
'still lie in his.&#xD;
" I love you," he said passionately,&#xD;
&#xD;
and, stooping, kissed her ivory shoul.&#xD;
der.&#xD;
"You have said that to me many&#xD;
times, before," she  said  earnestly,&#xD;
" but I do not know what it means.&#xD;
I am free ; if you truly loved me, you,&#xD;
would ask me to be your wife. Do&#xD;
you not love me enough for that?"&#xD;
she said,'with her voice all tremulous,&#xD;
"I am tired of the world, tired of&#xD;
empty admiration, tired of the whole&#xD;
of this weary stage of fashion and&#xD;
worldliness, where one must ever act&#xD;
a part one does not feel ! Since I first&#xD;
spoke with you, a new life has opened&#xD;
before me, and I know also, too late,&#xD;
that I never knew    what love was&#xD;
before. Will you not let me be your&#xD;
wife? I would go with you in obscu.&#xD;
rity anywhere,-in poverty, if you&#xD;
wished it ; if not, all my fortune is at&#xD;
your feet. Do not despise me, do not&#xD;
scorn so much love. I have never&#xD;
stooped before to humble myself; let&#xD;
me not fall too low, let me be your&#xD;
wife."&#xD;
"I love you," he repeated tenderly,&#xD;
passionately, "all that a man can&#xD;
love."&#xD;
" And shall I be your wife ?"she&#xD;
said again.-&#xD;
"Yes, my wife, all, all mine, Ca.&#xD;
milla ; you have my faith."&#xD;
They heard a low cry ; they turned&#xD;
quickly, but no one was near.&#xD;
"That was terrible," said Madame&#xD;
de Turenne ; "it really makes me feel&#xD;
nervous, as Madame Benoni would&#xD;
say. Take. me away," she said, look-&#xD;
ing around uneasily.&#xD;
~He drew her arm in his, and they&#xD;
passed into another 'parlor.&#xD;
Ina fled she knew not where, On&#xD;
and on through the different suites of&#xD;
&#xD;
apartments. A gentleman noticed her;&#xD;
he turned, looked, turned again and&#xD;
followed her; she found her way, how&#xD;
&#xD;
she knew not, into the entry. " Masks&#xD;
off!" shouted an official. It was just&#xD;
striking one o'clock ; but Ina flew by&#xD;
him down stairs, through the people&#xD;
that were in the street, -across the&#xD;
street. A coachman made a sign to&#xD;
her; she had just reached the coach,&#xD;
when suddenly she put out her hand,&#xD;
as if feeling for something, and fell&#xD;
down senseless on the pavement. A&#xD;
gentleman was behind her ; he darted&#xD;
forward, and bent over her ; he lifted&#xD;
her tenderly in his arms and into&#xD;
the carriage.  "Quickly," he said,&#xD;
"to Piazza Emanuele Filiberto !"&#xD;
"But the lady promised me fifty&#xD;
francs for this evening."&#xD;
"Quick, and I  ill give you a hun-&#xD;
dred," said Marcello, putting his&#xD;
hand in his pocket, and handing the&#xD;
man a bill. They were soon at his&#xD;
door. He lifted Ina out as if she&#xD;
had been a feather in his- arms.&#xD;
There she lay lifeless. He looked&#xD;
up at the window; there was a light,E&#xD;
and Katerina was looking out; he&#xD;
put his hand to his lips and made a&#xD;
sign to her ; she hurried to the door.&#xD;
He carried Ina up stairs, three long&#xD;
flights, without once stopping for&#xD;
breath, and, entering her room, laid&#xD;
her on her bed. "Open the window;r&#xD;
give me some water, some salts ;r&#xD;
for God's sake, do not make any r&#xD;
sound ! Ina, my beloved Ina, look I&#xD;
.up! 0 God, she does not breathe ! 1&#xD;
Ina, Ina," he said, beating her hands. h&#xD;
She gave a great sigh, and then a t&#xD;
gasp. " Ina, sweet Ina, look up; i&#xD;
open your eyes - once -once, -L&#xD;
speak, dearest !"                   i&#xD;
&#xD;
INA.                        111&#xD;
&#xD;
" Oh!" she said, looking around,&#xD;
"two wives ! Who said that he dould&#xD;
have two wives? I do not think&#xD;
that that can be. And what becomes,&#xD;
then, of the little child ? That must&#xD;
die ; but no one dies, they only live&#xD;
to suffer. How many wives can a&#xD;
man have?" she said, looking up&#xD;
pitifully in Marcello's face.&#xD;
" O Ina," he said, "you are here,&#xD;
at home ; do not talk so. I am al-&#xD;
most wild with grief myself; re-&#xD;
member, dearest, that you are here&#xD;
where everybody loves you."&#xD;
" Love," she said, still looking va-&#xD;
cantly into his face, -" is there such&#xD;
a thing as love ? why do men talk&#xD;
of it ? He said he loved ; does&#xD;
that mean    anything ?  They   say&#xD;
God loves us when he gives us&#xD;
life, but you do not think so, - do&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
" You must not talk, Ina, or I&#xD;
shall have to go and leave you all&#xD;
alone; you are not well, and you-&#xD;
must rest."&#xD;
"No, do not leave me," she said,&#xD;
stretching out her arms to him; "do&#xD;
not go !"&#xD;
" Then you must promise me to&#xD;
shut .your eyes, and be perfectly&#xD;
quiet."&#xD;
" I will," she said.&#xD;
Marcello remained by her side all&#xD;
night. She was very still, only every&#xD;
now and then he would hear her mur-&#xD;
mur, " Two wives." At seven o'clock&#xD;
he spoke to Katerina. "Undress your&#xD;
ady, fold away all her clothes, put&#xD;
ecr in bed, and, when it is breakfast-&#xD;
ime, then go to my mother, and tell&#xD;
ter that Mademoiselle Str~hling is&#xD;
ll, and the doctor must be sent for .&#xD;
immediately."&#xD;

CHAPTER     XV.&#xD;
M      ARCELLO had left the room.&#xD;
He had -changed his ball-&#xD;
room dress for his morning 'costume,&#xD;
and then sat down to listen to the&#xD;
first stirring from his .mother's room.&#xD;
He heard Katerina at last go to&#xD;
his mother's chamber ; he heard an&#xD;
impatient exclamation from her, -&#xD;
she alone had the'monopoly of ill&#xD;
health in that house, -then a loud&#xD;
ringing of the bells, and John was&#xD;
sent for the doctor. He felt relieved&#xD;
when he had heard the order given.&#xD;
He longed to go to Ina's room, and&#xD;
dared not; and he passed the morn-&#xD;
ing pacing to and fro in his. At&#xD;
last the doctor ame; he was a long&#xD;
time in Ina's room, and, when he&#xD;
dame out, Marcello was waiting at&#xD;
the front door for him. He put on&#xD;
his hat and accompanied the doctor&#xD;
down the street.&#xD;
"What do you think of your pa-&#xD;
tienit, Doctor ?"&#xD;
"I, do not quite understand the&#xD;
case," said the Doctor, seriously. "I&#xD;
could account for it if Mademoiselle&#xD;
Str5lyling had been subjected to&#xD;
some sudden news, some great sor-&#xD;
row ; but your mother says that&#xD;
nothing has occurred at all, and that&#xD;
she went to bed as usual perfect-&#xD;
ly quiet last evening.  I find ,con-&#xD;
gestion of the brain, and some dif-&#xD;
ficulty from the blood having rushed&#xD;
too suddenly to the heart. She is&#xD;
an inttere ting-looking creature. I&#xD;
should be grieved if it was a serious&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
"Doctor;' said Marcello, " Mad-&#xD;
emoiselle Str'6hling has been sub-&#xD;
jected to some terrible, as well as&#xD;
&#xD;
1A.&#xD;
&#xD;
sudden grief, and for a long time. -Ij&#xD;
think her peace of mind has been&#xD;
undermined by some great sorrow."&#xD;
"Hum!" paid the Doctor, "do you&#xD;
think there iis any means by which&#xD;
quiet and peace could be restored to&#xD;
her ?"&#xD;
Marcello was silent for a moment,&#xD;
and then said, " I fear not. I do not&#xD;
know at all precisely what her troub.&#xD;
les are, but I am   sure they are of&#xD;
no common kind.      She has great&#xD;
strength of character and remarka..&#xD;
ble courage, and she would not sink&#xD;
under anything that was easy to&#xD;
bear !"&#xD;
" I will consider it well," said the&#xD;
Doctor, "and will call around this&#xD;
evening. Just now      she must be&#xD;
kept very still, she has a great deal&#xD;
of fever."&#xD;
"Good morning," said Marcello;&#xD;
"you will be sure and call again this&#xD;
evening !"&#xD;
Marcello went home to wait and&#xD;
hope and fear. Towards the end of&#xD;
the" day he could stand it no longer;&#xD;
he crept to the door on tiptoe,&#xD;
so that his mother should not hear&#xD;
him, and asked Katerina if he might&#xD;
go in.  She nodded her head, and he&#xD;
walked silently to the bed. There&#xD;
Ina lay, white as the, sheet that&#xD;
covered her. Her eyes were closed,&#xD;
and it seemed almost to him, at first,&#xD;
- that she did not breathe. He bent&#xD;
down his head to her lips, and felt&#xD;
the slightest motion of her heart.&#xD;
He took her hand;. it lay listlessly&#xD;
extended, it was so lifeless, in his;&#xD;
but it was warm! He stood thus,&#xD;
-quietly watching her ; presently she&#xD;
-opened her' eyes. very slowly and&#xD;
looked at him so naturally; then&#xD;

face to the wall, and did not speak her fruits of the rarest kind, and&#xD;
again. For one week this state of the'little girls sat for hours in silence&#xD;

until sometimes she would sink back  "It was, they say, the night of&#xD;

The next day Madame de Turenne&#xD;
was announced.&#xD;
"Will you see her up here, my&#xD;
dear?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Ina.&#xD;
She was shown up stairs. She was&#xD;
radiant, dressed with the most ex-&#xD;
quisite taste, fresh with happiness ;&#xD;
and, softened by the new sentiment&#xD;
of love, she looked a vision of love-&#xD;
liness. She started when she saw&#xD;
Ina.. -&#xD;
"You find me changed," said Ina.&#xD;
"You have indeed been dreadfully&#xD;
il. I almost feel conscience-stricken&#xD;
when I see you; that I have been so&#xD;
happy, whilst you have been so- suf-&#xD;
fering."&#xD;
" The wheel of fortune moves&#xD;
around," said Ina, "now down, now&#xD;
up, but each one is crushed by it in&#xD;
turn."&#xD;
" Yes," said Madame de Turenne,&#xD;
" I too have had my trials."&#xD;
"We have all had them, my dear,"&#xD;
said Madame Benoni; " only there are&#xD;
few, very few, who know how to sup-&#xD;
port them with Christian fortitude, I&#xD;
must confess.- I have always made&#xD;
it a-point not to shrink from the tri-&#xD;
als of life, but to bear my cross with&#xD;
true 'resignation, and with that hu-&#xD;
mility which is due to the command&#xD;
of a higher Providence; and so far I&#xD;
congratulate myself that I have suc-&#xD;
ceeded."                .&#xD;
Madame de Turenne turned away&#xD;
her head to hide her smiles. "1D&#xD;
you think you will go out soon ?'&#xD;
she said. " The fresh air would do you&#xD;
good. Will you not let me come an&#xD;

" Thank you. Madame Benoni ha&#xD;

you when I am able to go out."&#xD;
" Ah," said Madame de Turenne,&#xD;
looking at her watch, " I have an ap-&#xD;
pointment with Eman - with Mon-&#xD;
sieur Bertani," and she blushed scar-&#xD;
let. "I did not know it was so late,&#xD;
but I only ran in as I was passing to&#xD;
see how you were, and I am so very&#xD;
glad to find that you are better ! You&#xD;
will come soon ? You know you&#xD;
promised!"&#xD;
She found Emanuele already await-&#xD;
ing her. He was walking the room&#xD;
impatiently as she entered.&#xD;
"0," she said, "I am  so glad you&#xD;
came first ! It is always I who stand&#xD;
and wait. It is such a happy surprise&#xD;
to find you here. I have just come&#xD;
from Madame Benoni's. I saw Mad-&#xD;
emoiselle Ina. 0 Emanuele, she is&#xD;
so changed ! She is a perfect wreck.&#xD;
She must have been terribly ill, poor&#xD;
thing !  I felt so sorry for her I could&#xD;
have cried. I .felt wickedly happy&#xD;
when I saw her looking so ill."&#xD;
Emanuele turned away his face, to&#xD;
conceal the emotion that passed:over&#xD;
it.&#xD;
"Did she congratulate you on your&#xD;
engagement ? did she seem to know&#xD;
of it ?" said Emanuele, quickly.&#xD;
" I do not know, I do not remem-&#xD;
ber, but I think you are unkind to&#xD;
- Mademoiselle Strohling. Any one&#xD;
would feel pity for her if he saw&#xD;
her, but you always did seem rather&#xD;
to dislike her than otherwise, and&#xD;
how you could I cannot imagine, for&#xD;
 she is so interesting;" even now, faded,&#xD;
d wan, emaciated as' she was, there&#xD;
was something lovely about her still.&#xD;
s I should have fallen in love with her,&#xD;
e had I been a man. Poor MarcellO,1I&#xD;
&#xD;
am afraid he is not happy in his&#xD;
love! .'But let us talk of ourselves,"&#xD;
she said, coming up to him, and lean-&#xD;
ing on him. " Tell me that you love&#xD;
me this morning just as well as you&#xD;
did last evening. Ah, I always feel&#xD;
afraid of losing your love, and I,-.-&#xD;
jdtainne, je t'adore, je suis tort-w-ait&#xD;
anio2tPeUse de toi!" she said passion-&#xD;
ately.&#xD;
"And I," he said, pressing his lips&#xD;
to hers, "return everything a thou-&#xD;
sand-fold!"&#xD;
"I want to tell you something,"&#xD;
she, said, " Emanuele, that has been&#xD;
on my heart, and weighs on it ; every&#xD;
time I see you my' lips refuse to say&#xD;
it. 0 dearest, do not be angry with&#xD;
me, I love you with my whole being,&#xD;
with every pulse, every sense, with&#xD;
my mind and my soul, but before I&#xD;
knew you I was very heartless. I fear,&#xD;
-- and it is not vanity that speaks, -&#xD;
I fear that I have made others suffer&#xD;
very much, and .when I was uncer-&#xD;
tain whether or no you loved me,&#xD;
and lay tossing at night in a fever of&#xD;
suspense, my lips parched, and my&#xD;
eyes wet with tears,- for I did cry for&#xD;
you," she said, looking up archly in&#xD;
his face,-" I used to be frightened,&#xD;
and wonder if it was a judgment&#xD;
upon me, and if as I had done it was&#xD;
requited unto me; but the worst of,&#xD;
all as - it makes me cold at night&#xD;
to think of'it, was -promise me to&#xD;
love me all the same ! Ah, Eman-&#xD;
nele, I was half engaged before I1&#xD;
met you, only half ! and then I broke&#xD;
it off so .coldly, without any mercy;&#xD;
Was it not dreadful ? I did not know&#xD;
what it was to hope, and lose all, and&#xD;
he said to me, 'God bless you, Ca-&#xD;
mnilla, but you will never be happy&#xD;
&#xD;
if you destroy others' peace of mind,"&#xD;
and Nina said the same thing to me&#xD;
a few days afterwards, and it always&#xD;
haunts me."&#xD;
" If that is all your sin, I freely ab-&#xD;
solve you, my enchantress."&#xD;
" Ah, I am so glad you forgive me ;&#xD;
but I cannot forgive myself !"&#xD;
A few days after this Ina was sit-&#xD;
ting alone in the same room with&#xD;
Marcello; they had not spoken for&#xD;
some time, when suddenly Ina looked&#xD;
up and said, " I must go out, and.&#xD;
alone ; how can I do so?"&#xD;
"I will tell my mother that you&#xD;
must take the air, that I will go with&#xD;
you because you are not strong&#xD;
enough to go alone, and that a man's&#xD;
support is better than a woman's;&#xD;
then, when we are out of sight of&#xD;
the house, you can leave me, -and I&#xD;
will wait for you until you return."&#xD;
".You are kind," said Ina; "I think&#xD;
it is the only way. Shall it be to-&#xD;
morrow ?"&#xD;
"It shall be whenever you wish; I&#xD;
am at your service always."&#xD;
" Then to-morrow at twelve o'clock&#xD;
I will go."&#xD;
Ina knew that that was Emanuele's&#xD;
hour for being in his own apartment,&#xD;
for he always returned home to take&#xD;
breakfast at ten o'clock, and then&#xD;
wrote until two; she had 'so often&#xD;
heard him say that his hours were&#xD;
always the same, and then she had&#xD;
found him there before just at that&#xD;
time. What would he say at receiving&#xD;
another visit from her ? She cared not,&#xD;
she must speak to him. What was he&#xD;
now to her ? what was his displeasure,&#xD;
his anger, or his fury to'her ? She&#xD;
cared not ; the tempest of his rage.&#xD;

INA.                          117&#xD;
&#xD;
no more of her now to be hurt, her&#xD;
flesh had turned to stone, her heart&#xD;
was dead. The next day at the ap-&#xD;
pointed hour Marcello was awaiting&#xD;
her in the parlor. They left the&#xD;
house together. When they had come&#xD;
under the porticos, Marcello said:&#xD;
"You can leave me now. ~I will go&#xD;
into some of these shops, and will&#xD;
wait till you come; do not hasten&#xD;
your steps."&#xD;
She looked'at him mournfully, and&#xD;
turned slowly'down aside street. She&#xD;
arrived soon at Emanuele's door; she&#xD;
rang the bell, and, merely saying&#xD;
"Tell Signor Bertani that a lady&#xD;
wishes to see him," passed on into his&#xD;
sitting-room. She opened the door,&#xD;
and there he sat with his back turned&#xD;
to her.   He turned, and started&#xD;
slightly when he saw her. She closed&#xD;
the door, and then stood erect before&#xD;
it, white as a marble statue and as&#xD;
cold.&#xD;
" You are surprised to see me&#xD;
here; it is indeed the last place&#xD;
where I should wish to see you, but&#xD;
I have come, to speak to you for&#xD;
the last time on earth ; there is a&#xD;
gulf between us which never can be&#xD;
passed.  I do not hate you," she&#xD;
said, her face perfectly motionless,&#xD;
save for the sharp lightning in her&#xD;
eye, -li'ghtning not such as lights up&#xD;
the sky in summer evenings, brighten-&#xD;
ing and playing between the clouds&#xD;
with sudden flashes, but with sharp,&#xD;
cutting flames, such as scathe and,&#xD;
blast. "I do not hate you," she said&#xD;
slowly, "for that would speak of a&#xD;
love that had been, and I' cannot&#xD;
remember now that I ever loved you.&#xD;
I despise you utterly. I even scorn&#xD;
myself that I can stand and look at&#xD;
&#xD;
you.- Something you have lost, like a&#xD;
hideous idol that has once been&#xD;
knelt to and worshipped as a god,&#xD;
when the true knowledge has turned&#xD;
its votary with loathing from it!&#xD;
Something has been taken from you,&#xD;
when a heart, fresh as morning and&#xD;
light as air, scathed by    you and&#xD;
heavy as lead, has forever left you&#xD;
alone." She paused for breath, and&#xD;
then continued ; " It is well for you&#xD;
that you do not believe in immortal-&#xD;
ity, or you would writhe at my feet&#xD;
with that agonizing thought of where&#xD;
your soul would go! .It is well for&#xD;
you that you do not believe in a&#xD;
life hereafter, where two women-&#xD;
perhaps there are more wives still!&#xD;
- would ever point at you, weeping&#xD;
their lost honor, and an innocent&#xD;
little child's face would turn away&#xD;
from  you with perpetual horror. It&#xD;
is a mercy too great for you that&#xD;
you believe that you will be blotted&#xD;
out when you die, and be as if yon&#xD;
never had been. I pity myself for&#xD;
having loved'you once, so much that&#xD;
there is no pity left for you. I can-&#xD;
not even pray to our Saviour to in-&#xD;
tercede for you, because you have&#xD;
rejected him. Live in your empty&#xD;
fame, the petty puppet of a corrupt&#xD;
nation, who hang upon . your false&#xD;
words and applaud your -life's lie!&#xD;
Live here happy, if yoig can, for then&#xD;
comes eternal death, not in, annihi-&#xD;
lation, as you believe, but in the&#xD;
'unceasing memory of what you were&#xD;
on earth ! Farewell. I can say these&#xD;
words now~ without one touch- of&#xD;
sorrow. You' are free, but not to dis.-&#xD;
honor your son; that link can never&#xD;
be severed, no, not -in eternity, ap~d it,&#xD;
will hang on you there like an iron&#xD;
&#xD;
manacle that will eat into your flesh. before him, and it was too late ! He&#xD;
Farewell, and weep in wild regret, strode the floor in his agony. With&#xD;
when I am gone, that there is not every card in his hands, had he lost&#xD;
&#xD;
one chord left for you to break !"&#xD;
She turned, and passed out of the&#xD;
room noiselessly as she had entered&#xD;
it.&#xD;
"Ina," he cried, in despair; "Ina,"&#xD;
he called aloud, - but only his own&#xD;
voice echoed through his room.  He&#xD;
sank back groaning, and covered his&#xD;
face with his hands ; every time he&#xD;
looked up he thought he saw her,&#xD;
like a spirit of revenge, standing&#xD;
before him, and her eyes burnt into&#xD;
his brain. He had been lured on by&#xD;
his ambition, his flattered vanity, his&#xD;
love of luxury and wealth, to court&#xD;
Camilla ; but now he was in love&#xD;
with her, she had taken possession of&#xD;
his fancy and his senses, she was&#xD;
beautiful, and he felt her rich&#xD;
Oriental beauty ; it was more to him&#xD;
than Ina's more spiritual charms;&#xD;
besides it was the last, the new love ;&#xD;
and to reach his full rose he had&#xD;
trodden on this blue violet, and had&#xD;
crushed out its life with scarcely&#xD;
one thought, after he had ceased to&#xD;
care for her.  Until Camilla    had&#xD;
wholly taken possession of his im-I&#xD;
agination, he  felt regret, remorse,&#xD;
repentance ; whilst still Ina's love-I&#xD;
lines had some hold on him, he had&#xD;
yearnings to set her right. But Ina c&#xD;
was poor, in an obscure position;&#xD;
Camilla was immensely rich, in the&#xD;
most brilliant one. Ina was surround-&#xD;
ed by, a thousand obstacles, she&#xD;
could not assert herself, she had no&#xD;
place; Camilla was free, and alone,&#xD;
she dazzled him by all she held out&#xD;
to him, and he - fell like 'Lucifer.&#xD;
Now for the first time he saw it all I&#xD;
&#xD;
forever his game ? Was that the&#xD;
woman,- she who stood so terrible&#xD;
there, like the last judgment,-was&#xD;
that the soft, graceful Ina ? He re-&#xD;
gretted her now that he had wholly&#xD;
lost her. She was, like Anthony's&#xD;
wife Fulvia, "good, being gone." The&#xD;
hand that would have shoved her&#xD;
off would gladly have plucked her&#xD;
back again.   He regretted every-&#xD;
thing; his mind was one wild chaos&#xD;
from which he knew no escape.&#xD;
As Ina turned the corner of Ber-&#xD;
tani's street, she was startled by&#xD;
seeing some one looking intently at&#xD;
her ; her veil was thick, and. it was&#xD;
drawn closely over her face ; she&#xD;
looked again, started,-was it her&#xD;
brother ? No, it could not be. She&#xD;
turned, but he who had attracted&#xD;
her attention had already disap-&#xD;
peared around the corner, and she&#xD;
dared not follow; she went back to&#xD;
where Marcello was waiting in anxi-&#xD;
etysfor her. He looked at her anx-&#xD;
iously, and  was shocked   at the&#xD;
change in her face ; the, unnatural&#xD;
lustre in her eyes had not yet gone,&#xD;
and this, with her excessive pallor,&#xD;
made a contrast that was painful,&#xD;
and almost frightened him. Mar-&#xD;
cello knew nothing, but he began to&#xD;
suspect many things.&#xD;

"Ask her if she will do me the&#xD;

feel so indolent to-day," she said to&#xD;
herself. She was reclining on her&#xD;
sofa, her beautiful hair wa's let&#xD;
down around her. shoulders, and&#xD;
she had been trying to fasten her&#xD;
attention on the book in her listless&#xD;

tell me .how !   Ah, Mademoiselle&#xD;
Strdhling, you have no weaknesses !&#xD;
You would never allow yourself to&#xD;
be so mastered by the tender passion.&#xD;
But how ill you look !"&#xD;
"How like you look to your pic-&#xD;
ture !" said Ina, slowly.&#xD;
"Yes, they say so;' do you fancy&#xD;
it ?  I think it is a little too low, -&#xD;
the chemise. I do not want Mon-&#xD;
sieur Bertani to see it. Do you&#xD;
think it looks indelicate, Mad-&#xD;
emoiselle Strhling ?- I was very&#xD;
thoughtless when I sat for that por-&#xD;
trait. Now all is so different. What&#xD;
a strange change love makes in one,&#xD;
--I mean true love ! I do not know&#xD;
why it is ~that I always feel my&#xD;
heart drawn to talk with you of&#xD;
all that I feel. I liked you from&#xD;
the very first; did you like - me ?&#xD;
4o you like me now, .rather ? For&#xD;
- , the past I do not care. I only care&#xD;
Sfor the present  I  m so happy in&#xD;
it!"    ,&#xD;
" Are you so happy ?" said Ina.&#xD;
"0O, exquisitely so ! I never&#xD;
dreamed of thief ; it seems as if life&#xD;
&#xD;
were just opening to me. I feel like&#xD;
spring, full of the rustle of a fresh&#xD;
wakening."&#xD;
"And suppose," said Ina, "that it&#xD;
should all suddenly be taken from&#xD;
you, that you should be told that&#xD;
Monsieur Bertani did not love you,&#xD;
what should you do,?"&#xD;
"I should try," she said, laughing,&#xD;
"to let my pride get the better of&#xD;
my love." And then a more earnest&#xD;
expression- came over her face, and&#xD;
she said, " I think it would kill me!"&#xD;
"But," she said, taking Ina's hand&#xD;
tenderly in hers, "you will not be&#xD;
vexed, nor think I take too great a&#xD;
liberty with you, if I ask you why-&#xD;
you do not smile on poor Marcello;&#xD;
he is so good, so true, so noble-mind-&#xD;
ed, and he loves you with his whole&#xD;
soul. Why, do you      know, Mad-&#xD;
emoiselle Strihling, I am going to&#xD;
make you a confession. I was al-&#xD;
most in love with him myself once,&#xD;
but he never liked me. A slight&#xD;
obstacle blew the flame. But when&#xD;
I saw that he was really invincible,&#xD;
then I got over it. I had had so&#xD;
many men at my feet that it never&#xD;
occurred to me that if I tried to win&#xD;
him he would not be won. Now I&#xD;
tell you all this out of generosity,&#xD;
because it makes a woman love a&#xD;
man better if she thinks others'have&#xD;
loved him also ; is it not so? Now&#xD;
won't you marry Marcello just to&#xD;
make me happy ?"- she said coax-&#xD;
ingly.&#xD;
" I am married already," said Ina,&#xD;
hoarsely. '&#xD;
" Good God, to him ! You do not&#xD;
mean so. 0, how can you, wear such&#xD;
a' mask ? I never would have be.-&#xD;
lieved it. But tell me, but quickly,&#xD;
&#xD;
how it all happened. Was it lately,&#xD;
to-day? 0 speak!" .&#xD;
"No, to Monsieur Bertani," said&#xD;
Ina, looking Camilla fixedly in the&#xD;
eyes. It was a comfort in that mo-&#xD;
ment to her to know that she could&#xD;
inflict some torture equal-to her own.&#xD;
"Is there another Monsieur Ber-&#xD;
tani in the world ? "&#xD;
"None that I know of; my hus-&#xD;
band is Monsieur Emanuele Ber-&#xD;
tani."&#xD;
"You frighten me," said Madame&#xD;
de Turenne, springing up, and mov-&#xD;
ing a little away from Ina. "Are&#xD;
you speaking in earnest," (then she&#xD;
thought, " She is really mad,") "or&#xD;
are you in jest ? "&#xD;
But Ina rose too, and put out her&#xD;
hand, gas if to say "Do not go."&#xD;
Then she said quietly, "Do not be&#xD;
frightened. I am myself as perfect-&#xD;
ly as you are yourself. I am mar-&#xD;
ried before God to Emanuele Ber-&#xD;
tani. It is now one year and three&#xD;
months since our marriage. I loved&#xD;
him more than you love him, be-I&#xD;
cause I was alone in the world,1&#xD;
because I had no one to care for save&#xD;
him. And he was my first and only&#xD;
love. He took me to Switzerfand&#xD;
and married me there, under promise&#xD;
of secrecy. We were married in my'&#xD;
faith. I was innocent of its not ]&#xD;
being a legal marriage in a Catholic&#xD;
country. He did not tell me that 1&#xD;
until after he had met you. I was I&#xD;
at the mask-ball the night you told&#xD;
him of your love. I was behinds&#xD;
you, and heard all."                t&#xD;
"0 God ! 0 God ! " said Camilla, ~&#xD;
Cowering before her. ." 0 save me ! s&#xD;
o save me ! I love him, I love him ! "'&#xD;
o God, help me !" and she tore her i&#xD;
&#xD;
hair in her despair. Then, starting&#xD;
up, she looked wildly around as if&#xD;
she heard something, and uttered&#xD;
these words, which Ina did not un-&#xD;
derstand, -" That low cry !"&#xD;
"I would not have spoken," said&#xD;
Ina. "I have had my heart killed,&#xD;
and I know the agony of pain. I&#xD;
know all life's torture, but I would&#xD;
not have spoken for myself, not to&#xD;
revenge myself.- I would have been si-&#xD;
lent until.death, but another's life was&#xD;
mine. I could not wrong my child."&#xD;
"That too !" said Camilla, shudder-&#xD;
ing; "you have been happier than&#xD;
I."  She looked up at Ina then, and&#xD;
saw such deadly despair pass over&#xD;
her face that she forgot herself. "0&#xD;
Ina," she said, "forgive me ! you&#xD;
have suffered more than I, my&#xD;
poor broken-hearted , sister !"  And&#xD;
she burst into tears, and flung her&#xD;
arms around her neck. Ia uttered&#xD;
a suppressed sob, and laid her head&#xD;
on Camilla's shoulder. " Poor thing !&#xD;
poor thing !" said Camilla, kissing&#xD;
her cheek. "0    my God, help us&#xD;
both ! Ina, can you forgive me all&#xD;
the pain I have unwillingly inflicted?&#xD;
This one pang of mine was vengeance&#xD;
enough !"&#xD;
"I have nothing to forgive," said&#xD;
Ina; "you were innocent of all wrong.&#xD;
Farewell, my sister; our paths are&#xD;
wide apart ; both have to suffer, but&#xD;
both can learn to say, 'Thy will,&#xD;
thy will, not ours be done."&#xD;
Camilla was alone again, and she&#xD;
stood still as if she were rooted to&#xD;
the ground.   Great burning spots&#xD;
were on her cheeks, her eyes were&#xD;
wollen and heavy with weeping.&#xD;
Hs it come to this ?" she said ; "has&#xD;
t indeed come to this ? You arg re~&#xD;

avenged now, Miro. You are all re-&#xD;
venged. Come and drink it in, - the&#xD;
sweet draught of revenge ! He said so.&#xD;
, You cannot be happy if you- make&#xD;
others unhappy!' Did he pray that&#xD;
I might not be ? This is cruel, and&#xD;
yet I deserved it all. 0 God, suppose&#xD;
I cannot cease to love him, what&#xD;
should I do ? Ah, how dreary life&#xD;
looks! What shall I do with myyouth,&#xD;
my love, my beauty, as he calledit?&#xD;
How. shall I pass my time? how will,&#xD;
the days go by, the weeks, the years?&#xD;
Can I die ? I am so strong. 0, let&#xD;
me die !" and she flung herself upon&#xD;
her knees, and prayed God for death.&#xD;
"And Ina has suffered worse pain than&#xD;
this? 0 no, because she has no re-&#xD;
morse; and yet is that not more ter-&#xD;
rible, knowing it is not merited? He&#xD;
loved me. I hate him. I should like&#xD;
to kill him. He feigned love for my&#xD;
wealth. It would be a consolation, in&#xD;
all his baseness, to know he loved me;&#xD;
but how get at the bottom of his&#xD;
soul?" &#xD;
"Monsieur Bertani !" said the man&#xD;
waiter.&#xD;
"Show him in," said Camilla.&#xD;
"In here, Madame ?"&#xD;
Yes, just here ! - Have you not&#xD;
heard my orders ?"&#xD;
Bertani entered, and the door was&#xD;
closed behind him. One look told him&#xD;
that she knew all.&#xD;
" Come- here !" she said, standing&#xD;
erect before him, and pointing impe-&#xD;
riously with her finger to the place&#xD;
where she wished him to come to.&#xD;
"Stand there, and listen to me. Do&#xD;
not approach me, or I shall flay you&#xD;
perhaps with my own hands. 0, you&#xD;
thought my beauty was soft and&#xD;
womanly ! you thought my eyes were&#xD;
&#xD;
made for love ! Look in themnow,&#xD;
and they flashed like fire,-." and read&#xD;
hatredin them. I hate you, yes;withall&#xD;
my body, with all my soul, and with&#xD;
all my heart. Had you betrayed me&#xD;
alone, I would have forgiven you, but&#xD;
Ina, the sweetest, 'loveliest, purest&#xD;
creature on-the earth ! You thought,&#xD;
sir, to play with all'the world, and&#xD;
ere you finish your career the world&#xD;
may play with you ! Like Rousseau,&#xD;
y u write of education and virtue,&#xD;
a 'd work for places for the children&#xD;
of others, when your own are name.&#xD;
less ,and abandoned by you. Like&#xD;
Nero, you would make for yourself&#xD;
music, that the cries of those that&#xD;
are burning in the flames kindled by&#xD;
your own hands might not reach you,&#xD;
I find no name. bad enough; seducer,&#xD;
betrayer, are too fair for you !"&#xD;
" Camilla," he began.&#xD;
"Do not speak my name, do not&#xD;
soil it by breathing on it again, leave&#xD;
what you can of it pure. And even&#xD;
my fortune was to gild your triumphs,&#xD;
not I ! Beauty, truth, gentleness,&#xD;
were not enough, because you found&#xD;
them poor and obsc-urely hidden, but&#xD;
you must have wealth !"&#xD;
"Madame de Turenne, I swear that,&#xD;
I loved you, not your wealth. I was&#xD;
led away,,dazzled."&#xD;
0, take no oaths!" she said; "they&#xD;
are all broken on youi; lips ! You&#xD;
have no honor to swear by. I pity&#xD;
you from   the bottom   of my soul&#xD;
Now go, and take with you the ha.&#xD;
tred of two women!")&#xD;
Bertani groaned; he remembered&#xD;
that lIla had not even accorded himi&#xD;
her hatred or her pity.&#xD;
"Farewell," he said, " Camilla ;may&#xD;
you learn some day to forgive !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Never," she said, and she. pointed&#xD;
to the door._ He went out of it; it shut&#xD;
behind him, and Camilla threw her-&#xD;
self on her sofa in an agony of tears.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
B ERTANI was alone in his room&#xD;
when a knock was heard at it.&#xD;
He went to the door and opened it ;&#xD;
it was Marcello. " Come in," he said&#xD;
hoarsely ; "it is long since I have&#xD;
seen you."&#xD;
"Yes," said Marcello ; "you are&#xD;
much absorbed in your new happi-&#xD;
ness, and none, who knew the cause,&#xD;
could blame you !"&#xD;
"Sit down," said Bertani, handing&#xD;
him a chair, " and 'take a cigar ! "&#xD;
"I will not sit down with you&#xD;
until you have explained to me&#xD;
your conduct ! An ignominious love&#xD;
is a thing to be ashamed of,. but a&#xD;
manly devotion of the heart, although&#xD;
without hope, for a pure woman, is&#xD;
ennobling to the man who feels it. I&#xD;
have no false pride, and I shrink not&#xD;
from saying that a. lady whom you&#xD;
have falsely dealt with I love. That&#xD;
lady has cruelly suffered at your hand;&#xD;
and I conie here to. ask satisfaction&#xD;
for her, or, by Heaven, Bertani, your,&#xD;
blood shall answer it for me ! "&#xD;
"Take care what you say," said&#xD;
Bertani, while the dark blood mantled&#xD;
his brow ; " no one' shall ask an ex-&#xD;
planation of my actions. I have loved&#xD;
you, Marcello, more than a brother,&#xD;
but I will not bear from'you what I&#xD;
would not from a brother. I am free&#xD;
to do as I choose. I recognize no&#xD;
-laws save those that man creates for&#xD;
himself." -&#xD;
&#xD;
" No, you are not free,; the laws of&#xD;
society, of the Bible, of humanity,&#xD;
bind all men. So long as a man lives,&#xD;
he is not free; if he were, there would&#xD;
be nothing but rapine, murder, vio-&#xD;
lence, and seduction. It is just this&#xD;
that civilization and Christianity have&#xD;
taught us, that we are bound to re-&#xD;
spect each other's rights, each other's&#xD;
property. Each human creature has&#xD;
a moral responsibility, and this .he&#xD;
must uphold, orfall himself; it is not&#xD;
with impunity that we can sin."&#xD;
" Perhaps not, where the property&#xD;
of others is concerned, but I deny&#xD;
that I have ever robbed any man of&#xD;
what belonged to him; these things&#xD;
are mutual contracts, my dear Mar-&#xD;
cello, where we give and receive."&#xD;
"It is false," said Marcello ; "a fee-&#xD;
ble, innocent woman is not on an&#xD;
equality with a cold man of the&#xD;
world. What does she know of his&#xD;
arts, of his power? You completely&#xD;
enshare her, and then you make her&#xD;
your victim. And you shall trample&#xD;
no human heart in which I have an&#xD;
interest in the dust, and, by Heaven,&#xD;
Bertani, if you marry Madame de {&#xD;
Turenne, it will have to be after my&#xD;
voice is first hushed forever, and my&#xD;
arm made powerless by death; for,&#xD;
so long as I live, I will protect her&#xD;
whom you have wronged,&#xD;
"And whom,pray, have I wronged?"&#xD;
said Bertani, angrily. "You shall&#xD;
answer with your blood for this."&#xD;
" Be it so. It is Ina Str5hling of&#xD;
whom I speak."   As Marcello spoke,&#xD;
both of them had moved towards the&#xD;
window. Bertani's'apartment was on&#xD;
the -first floor. Emanuele leaned a&#xD;
little out of the window, and, pointing.&#xD;
to some one who was standing be-&#xD;

&#xD;
low, said coldly: "Perhaps it would&#xD;
be as well to lower your voice, and&#xD;
not to give to the whole city the&#xD;
name of her whose cause you are&#xD;
about to vindicate." Just at that&#xD;
moment the loud report of a pistol&#xD;
was heard, and Emanuele Bertani&#xD;
fell headlong on the floor of his&#xD;
room. Marcello stared at him for a&#xD;
moment without being able to take&#xD;
in what had happened ; then he&#xD;
threw himself down by his side and&#xD;
called, "Bertani, Bertani!" but there&#xD;
was no sound, no motion; he rushed&#xD;
to the door. "Help help !" he cried,&#xD;
"for God's sake, help !" A man ran&#xD;
up stairs. "Help !" he repeated,"he is&#xD;
dying - dead ! tell some one to come,!&#xD;
go for the surgeon !" and he went&#xD;
back to Bertani, and knelt down by&#xD;
his side. Some men came in, Marcello&#xD;
did not know who they were; they&#xD;
raised Bertani and put him on the bed.&#xD;
The blood was flowing warm from his&#xD;
chest ; they tried to stanch it with&#xD;
towels bathed in cold water. His eyes&#xD;
were shut, and his face was sharp as&#xD;
if it had been chiselled in marble.&#xD;
"'In the midst .of life we are in&#xD;
death,'" thought - Marcello, as, he&#xD;
looked down at his friend, so lately&#xD;
full of life and power, now stretched&#xD;
helplessly there. He could do no more&#xD;
harm now. Marcello felt that all his&#xD;
resentment was dead; his angry words&#xD;
had been hushed on his lips. -Other&#xD;
hands had wrought revenge, -whose&#xD;
could .they have been? *Was it an&#xD;
accidental shot? or was it from some&#xD;
one deeply injured as he was, -some&#xD;
one who had had the honor, too, of&#xD;
his beloved to redress ? Should he&#xD;
himself be implicated ? How clear&#xD;
himself ? He had come there indeed&#xD;
&#xD;
If&#xD;
&#xD;
gray-headed man, bowed&#xD;
painful work before his&#xD;
&#xD;
down by&#xD;
time; he&#xD;
&#xD;
INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
NA.&#xD;
thirsting for blood but not without&#xD;
a fair trial betwe  them, not to take&#xD;
him by surpris , not to stab him&#xD;
when his eyes were turned away&#xD;
"He was bra e," said Marcello to&#xD;
himself, "he was full of courage,--. not&#xD;
the courage which a Christian life&#xD;
brings, when one fears not because&#xD;
no mortal arm can kill the soul, but&#xD;
with the keen courage of a cold&#xD;
philosophy, which taught him that&#xD;
fate was fate, and it was "useless to&#xD;
struggle against its mandates. He was&#xD;
strong, he was brilliant, and full of&#xD;
intellectual force; but he had no&#xD;
guiding star of faith, no hope in a&#xD;
better world, in a higher life, and so&#xD;
he made his kingdom on this earth,&#xD;
and he was his own god. Poor, power-&#xD;
less thing! see now how a superior&#xD;
power mocks at him ! He cannot raise&#xD;
his hand, even for mercy. That grand&#xD;
brow was made by One greater than&#xD;
he, and its thought, now still, was&#xD;
given by One who will not be frus-&#xD;
trated in his plans. 0, at the last,&#xD;
how all disappears ! how all worldly,&#xD;
grandeur vanishes away like a mist!&#xD;
'We brought nothing into this world,&#xD;
we can take nothing out.' All our&#xD;
work crumbles into dust before our&#xD;
eyes, and the few good acts we have&#xD;
done' bend over us, and hover around&#xD;
us, like bright spirits from  another&#xD;
land ; they are   our prayers then,&#xD;
which ascend to the Almighty, and&#xD;
with outstretched arms intercede for&#xD;
us at his throne of grace."&#xD;
A knock at the door roused Mar-&#xD;
cello from .his reveries, and he went&#xD;
silently to' it, and opened it. It was&#xD;
the surgeon, Dr. B-. H~e was a&#xD;
&#xD;
123&#xD;
&#xD;
was well known in Turin, and has&#xD;
since been made physician of the&#xD;
court; lie had a'kind, gentle face, full&#xD;
of love, and overflowing with human&#xD;
sympathies.&#xD;
lie walked slowly up to the bed,&#xD;
and took the unconscious man's hand&#xD;
in his; he felt his pulse, he opened&#xD;
his vest and shirt, and put his ear to&#xD;
his heart; then he began examining&#xD;
the wound. He asked Marcello for a&#xD;
basin.&#xD;
"Do you want help ?" said Mar-&#xD;
cello.&#xD;
"No, I prefer to be alone with&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Is the wound very dangerous?"&#xD;
said Marcello. " Can he live ?"&#xD;
The surgeon sighed deeply. Mar-&#xD;
cell saw the tears spring to his&#xD;
eyes. " This is sad work," he said, as&#xD;
he examined more closely; "had it&#xD;
been one hair's-breadth more to the&#xD;
right, there had been hope, but, as it&#xD;
is, it is mortal. It seems to me im-&#xD;
possible. Why, I saw him only this&#xD;
morning, and spoke to him as he&#xD;
passed, but I thought he looked&#xD;
as if his sky was clouded. I even&#xD;
turned and glanced after him, and I&#xD;
remember wondering what had gone&#xD;
wrong now   in the Cabinet. IRoor&#xD;
Bertani! he had a grand intelligence,&#xD;
but something was wanting here,"&#xD;
he said, pointing to his heart. "' A&#xD;
man cannot live without a guiding&#xD;
principle, and I felt this want in our&#xD;
friend even from the first. Freedom&#xD;
we are permitted for a long time,&#xD;
and prosperity follows even our bad&#xD;
actions, but it is always within a&#xD;
given compass, and in the end a&#xD;
higher Power asserts itself. It seems&#xD;
as if God were watching sometimes&#xD;
&#xD;
to see how much we could accom-&#xD;
plish by ourselves alone, and how far&#xD;
we could go ! You must keep our&#xD;
friend per ctly quiet, see that he is&#xD;
not agitated; do not talk with him,&#xD;
and do not leave him alone a .mo-&#xD;
ment, lest his bandages should slip.&#xD;
I will call again in a few hours."&#xD;
Marcello was alone with Bertani.&#xD;
0, how many thoughts rushed over&#xD;
him! What now would become of&#xD;
Ina? He felt sure that in some mys-&#xD;
terious way her life was bound up&#xD;
with that of Bertani; how he knew&#xD;
not. Who would break to her this&#xD;
news ? And Madame de Turenne, his&#xD;
affianced bride, - what would now&#xD;
become of all her brilliancy? How&#xD;
changed seemed all their lives ! and&#xD;
he alone knew of the dreadful disas-&#xD;
ter that was hanging over them, he&#xD;
alone sat by and watched the dying&#xD;
man ! There he sat for an hour, always&#xD;
with his eyes fixed on Bertani's pale&#xD;
face, when suddenly he started, his&#xD;
heart beat like a drum, Bertani's&#xD;
large -dark eyes were open, and he&#xD;
was looking at him; he could not&#xD;
turn away from that gaze, and yet it&#xD;
took away his strength.&#xD;
"It is the finger of God," said Ber-&#xD;
tani, slowly ;. "it is the righteous&#xD;
judgment of sin. I know it now too&#xD;
late! and there is no hope. Death !&#xD;
he murmured, - "to go alone through&#xD;
the dark valley I Marcello, speak to&#xD;
me, comfort me, stay by me."&#xD;
The cold perspiration stood on his&#xD;
brow, like great beads.&#xD;
"I will stay by you," said Mar-&#xD;
cello, "but you must be perfectly&#xD;
quiet; these were the orders left by&#xD;
the surgeon."~&#xD;
"Marcello, here no- physician can&#xD;

secured. I did not wish to be dragged&#xD;
down by poverty and family cares.&#xD;
Our marriage vows were never con-&#xD;
firmed; therefore it was illegal; be-&#xD;
fore man, no marriage ! When I saw&#xD;
my honors increasing, I forgot my&#xD;
honor, and thought to take advantage&#xD;
of this letter f the law to 'be free,&#xD;
and so I did. Then I fell in love&#xD;
with another woman,. and asked her&#xD;
to be my wife ; she consented, not&#xD;
knowing anything of my treachery&#xD;
and baseness. Ina has a son; he has&#xD;
no name, no father; I must give him&#xD;
both. It is the only restitution I can&#xD;
make. Yku who love her - yes, I&#xD;
know that=- must go to her, entreat&#xD;
her to come to me, and to accept all&#xD;
that is left for me to give on earth.&#xD;
I thust to you, for you cannot deceive ;&#xD;
and then you cannot hate. me now, for&#xD;
your rival lies crushed and humbled&#xD;
before you, never to rise again ; will&#xD;
you do this ? 0," he said, " if you knew&#xD;
their burning fever that is 'eating up&#xD;
my strength, you would not refuse&#xD;
me anything ! Go, for God's sake, and&#xD;
implore her, not in my name, - that&#xD;
has no claims on her mercy, - but in&#xD;
yours.  Tell her to come for her&#xD;
child's sake. And first go for a priest&#xD;
to unite us. -0, go, go, Marcello!&#xD;
There is no time to lose," and he&#xD;
"daenot leave you. said Mae-&#xD;
&#xD;
cello ; "the doctor said you must not&#xD;
- be alone, you might lose too much&#xD;
blood."&#xD;
"I have lost too much already," he&#xD;
said, turning his ashen face to Mar,&#xD;
cello; it was all sunken away already,&#xD;
and his eyes looked like two great&#xD;
dark stars.&#xD;
Marcello looked at him, and such&#xD;
t pity came into his soul that he said&#xD;
-quickly; "I will go."  He thought to&#xD;
himself, " He cannot live, and it is&#xD;
better to give him   peace of mind&#xD;
than a few hours more of misery."&#xD;
So he hastened a way. His first steps&#xD;
were directed to a priest's house, one&#xD;
whom he knew well.&#xD;
"Father," he said, "this is no time&#xD;
for words. Bertani, our statesman, is&#xD;
dying, shot through   the breast by&#xD;
some deadly enemy. Go to him with&#xD;
the extreme unction, and absolve his&#xD;
soul if you can!"&#xD;
"I will go, my son, immediately,"&#xD;
and Marcello hastened to his own,&#xD;
house. 0, with what heavy steps&#xD;
he ascended the stairs ! He opened&#xD;
the front 'door ; all was unchanged,&#xD;
there was no hurry there, no dull&#xD;
silence like that, he had left ; could&#xD;
things look so, and he have passed&#xD;
through so much? A servant was in&#xD;
the entry ; he heard the canary-bird&#xD;
singing at the top of its voice.&#xD;
"Where was his mother'?" Gone out,&#xD;
for the first time in the open carriage!-&#xD;
' His father ?" Monsieur had not re-&#xD;
turned since he left the house, after&#xD;
breakfast. " The young ladies ?"&#xD;
They had gone with Madame! and&#xD;
last of all he said, "And Mademoi.-&#xD;
selle Striihling ?" "She is in her&#xD;
room, sir !" Ah, she was at home, -&#xD;
she, the, only one whom he would&#xD;
&#xD;
gladly have found not there ! He&#xD;
must see her, he must confront her&#xD;
eyes, with this too  terrible news.&#xD;
How.would she take it?  Would it&#xD;
kill her ? Two dead in one day ! He&#xD;
had not been able to arrange his&#xD;
thoughts before ; now it all hurried&#xD;
like a great chaos before his mind.&#xD;
He went straight to Ina's room. She&#xD;
opened the door suddenly as he ap-&#xD;
proached it, and looked out nervous-&#xD;
ly. "I thought something was the&#xD;
matter," she said, in an apologetic&#xD;
tone of voice ; " you opened the front&#xD;
door so hastily."&#xD;
"May I come in ?" he said.&#xD;
"Yes," she answered. The room was&#xD;
strewn with her clothes, and two&#xD;
trunks stood open, with their trays&#xD;
on the floor.&#xD;
" Are you going away ?" he said&#xD;
absently.&#xD;
She looked at him with a strange&#xD;
perplexed air, and said "Yes !" She&#xD;
looked at him now with her eyes&#xD;
fixed into a terrible stare ; he-shrank&#xD;
before their unnatural gaze.&#xD;
"Th6re is blood on you,". she said&#xD;
slowly ; "whence does it come ? - a&#xD;
spot on your shirt, and look at your&#xD;
hand !"&#xD;
He looked down to the place where&#xD;
her eyes rested ; he had not noticed it&#xD;
himself; he saw it now, and shud-&#xD;
dered.&#xD;
"Ina," he said, "it is the blood, of&#xD;
him you once loved, but not spilt by&#xD;
me; no, I take God to witness that&#xD;
I am innocent of it." She stood ever&#xD;
looking at him   with  that vacant&#xD;
stare. He went up to her and touched&#xD;
her arm; she shrank shivering from&#xD;
him.                      .- ~&#xD;
,"lIna," he said, "the shot came&#xD;
&#xD;
from  outside, not from  my'hands;&#xD;
before God, I swear it to you!"&#xD;
Ina leaned against the door for&#xD;
support, and uttered a low scream of&#xD;
agony ; she put her hands quickly be-&#xD;
fore her eyes, as if to shut out the&#xD;
light. "I know it, I know it, I told&#xD;
him so," she mu   ured. "0 God !"&#xD;
" Ina, he is dyi g, and you must go&#xD;
to him; he implo kes you to come."&#xD;
"I am   ready,' said Ina, and she&#xD;
looked at him abs ntly; "why do you&#xD;
not take me ?"&#xD;
"Ina dearest, you must collect&#xD;
yourself; put on yo r hat, and we&#xD;
will go together ; the carriage is at&#xD;
the door. If he should die, you would&#xD;
never.forgive yourself if you were not&#xD;
there. Ina,"' he continued, "listen.&#xD;
I know all. I was with him when it&#xD;
happened.   He lay unconscious for&#xD;
some time, and then he spoke to me,&#xD;
and told me all, - yes, all. He wants&#xD;
you now that he may give you his.&#xD;
name; the priest will be awaiting you,&#xD;
and dying he willgive you those rights&#xD;
which he denied you living: You&#xD;
will not refuse him this consolation,&#xD;
you will not refuse to him his resti-&#xD;
tution."&#xD;
' She looked up lifelessly in his&#xD;
face ; she came and stood before&#xD;
him so quietly, as she was fastening&#xD;
on her hat, and she said, "I cannot,&#xD;
I cannot, Marcello. I am his wife&#xD;
before God. I care not for man. I&#xD;
cannot put my hand in his- again.&#xD;
I will not bear his name."&#xD;
Marcello led her gently down&#xD;
stairs, into the carriage, and they&#xD;
drove rapidly to the apartment&#xD;
where a few days before Ina had&#xD;
been. The news had already begun&#xD;
to spread. A crowd of people had&#xD;

126  -.INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
gathered around the door. They&#xD;
were kept back from   entering by&#xD;
Bertani's faithful domestic and the&#xD;
gendarmes.  The   excitement was&#xD;
intense as Marcello's carriage drove&#xD;
up to the door, and he helped Ina&#xD;
out of it. They pressed forward to&#xD;
look at her ; but Marcello, sustaining&#xD;
her with one arm, with the other&#xD;
motioned off the men and women&#xD;
that were foremost in their curiosity.&#xD;
Ina shrank away 'from  them with&#xD;
terror, and Marcello drew her up&#xD;
stairs. He. opened the door, and&#xD;
there lay the man whom    she had&#xD;
loved so madly once, white as death,&#xD;
with his .eyes fixed on the -door.&#xD;
Marcello drew Ina's unresisting form&#xD;
towards the bed.&#xD;
"Have you come ?" said Eman-&#xD;
uele. "I knew    you would ; you&#xD;
were ever too good to refuse comfort&#xD;
to a human creature. Stoop down,&#xD;
and let me whisper in your ear."&#xD;
She bent her head as if it were me-&#xD;
chanically, for she did not look as if&#xD;
she understood what he said; and&#xD;
then suddenly she uttered' another&#xD;
scream, just such as Marcello had&#xD;
heard in her room when he had told&#xD;
her that he had not shed Enanuele's&#xD;
blood. And now through the si-&#xD;
lence-. was heard a solemn tinkle,&#xD;
tinkle of a little bell,-a bell that&#xD;
was ringing out a life,-a bell that&#xD;
told of the death agony, of confession,&#xD;
repentance, and absolution, - a bell&#xD;
that makes all busy passers-by stop for&#xD;
a moment their hurried footsteps, and&#xD;
pause before the crowding thoughts&#xD;
I   of life, and feel that this little bell&#xD;
might have been sounding for one&#xD;
they loved, perhaps for themselves;&#xD;
and God himself seems walking&#xD;
&#xD;
amongst the crowd, and awe and&#xD;
reverence and love fill their souls,&#xD;
Nearer and nearer it came, with tle&#xD;
priest in white, and the Host in his:&#xD;
hand, and the baldachin that covers&#xD;
it, and the torches that light him to&#xD;
his work of -faith. The door opened,&#xD;
and he stood on Emanuele's threshold,&#xD;
Bertani heard it, and every pulse&#xD;
started into life; he raised himself&#xD;
on his pillow and glared at the ser-&#xD;
vant of the Lord.  "Away," he cried,&#xD;
"away with your false mummeries&#xD;
I will die, as I have lived, out of the&#xD;
Church. No man can save my soul;&#xD;
He alone whom I have ~denied can&#xD;
do that now. No man with his cor-&#xD;
rupt heart can step between me and&#xD;
the Almighty. I have faced my life,&#xD;
I will face my death ; and not like&#xD;
a coward think to creep into heaven&#xD;
under the bloody frock of your re-&#xD;
ligion. Away!!" he said, with such&#xD;
vehemence that Marcello approached&#xD;
the door of the room, and made a.&#xD;
sign for the priest to move back.&#xD;
The priest looked very angry, but&#xD;
Marcello said to him, "Father, re-&#xD;
member that we are in the presence&#xD;
of the Lord. - Your calling is holy;&#xD;
wait until I come to you with some&#xD;
words of hope; .there is more virtue&#xD;
in religion when there is more to&#xD;
forgive."&#xD;
He returned to Emanuele's room;&#xD;
he had sunk back exhausted on his&#xD;
pillow, but his eyes were open. "I&#xD;
will not confess to man," he said,&#xD;
" save as to my equal. I have told&#xD;
you my faults, I wish to repair them;&#xD;
let that suffice."'&#xD;
"It 'cannot be," said Marcello;&#xD;
" to git.e Ina your name, you must&#xD;
first confess your sins to the priest."'&#xD;
&#xD;
aIs that indeed' so ? I had forgot ;&#xD;
then let him come, I care not."&#xD;
"But I will not bear your name,"&#xD;
said Ina, firmly. "I will not be&#xD;
your wife."&#xD;
A sharp spasm passed over Eman-&#xD;
uele's face, and he said, "Ina, for&#xD;
God's sake, forgive ! I believe that&#xD;
we all have to stand before the judg-&#xD;
ment-seat; let me take your forgive-&#xD;
ness there ! "&#xD;
"I forgive you," said Ina, her face&#xD;
perfectly immovable, her large, blue&#xD;
eyes always averted, "but I cannot&#xD;
be your wife; let me be free !"&#xD;
" Death will set you free," he said,&#xD;
"erelong. Ina, in the name of your&#xD;
past love, for pity's sake, for my soul's&#xD;
sake ! Ina, I believe that I have a&#xD;
soul."&#xD;
She shook her head, and said&#xD;
slowly, " I cannot bear your name."&#xD;
Emanuele's whole face was. con-&#xD;
vulsed; he writhed in bed.    Then&#xD;
there was a silence; then he lifted&#xD;
himself up, and, clasping his hands,&#xD;
said, "Ina, for his sake, for the&#xD;
child's future, for our boy, 0, take&#xD;
my worthless name, and he will set&#xD;
it again, and give it lustre, Ina,&#xD;
that I may not die on, earth ! 0,&#xD;
speak ! give me that mercy that I&#xD;
may redress his wrongs; it/ is all&#xD;
that is left me of my was, d life.&#xD;
Marcello," he said, "plead or me,&#xD;
move her heart. Ah, once it was all&#xD;
love and pity! Ina, not on me then,&#xD;
on our boy, have some mercy! I am&#xD;
dying," he said, gasping for breath,&#xD;
Ina turned and put her cold hand'&#xD;
in his ; his was damp. .&#xD;
"Let it be, then, as you wish; I&#xD;
will take your name, and give it to&#xD;
our boy !" .&#xD;
&#xD;
Ir&#xD;
&#xD;
NA.                             127&#xD;
He looked up at her with a glance&#xD;
of intense and unspeakable gratitude,&#xD;
and closed his eyes; soon he opened&#xD;
them again, and made a sign to&#xD;
Marcello. Marcello bent his ear,&#xD;
and then went to the door; he made&#xD;
a sign to Ina to follow him. And&#xD;
then the priest came in alone ; he&#xD;
was about a quarter of an hour there,&#xD;
when he opened the door again, and&#xD;
let in Ina and Marcello. He opened&#xD;
his book. Ina went and stood by&#xD;
the bedside. The priest took   off&#xD;
her little ring, that had been placed&#xD;
on her finger more than a year ago,&#xD;
when her life was full and fresh&#xD;
and young. He placed her hand in&#xD;
Emanuele's, and then performed over&#xD;
them the ceremony' which should&#xD;
unite them once more until death&#xD;
should separate them so soon ! And&#xD;
when it was finished he laid his&#xD;
hands upon their heads, and left&#xD;
them.&#xD;
There was a great silence in the&#xD;
room, but there was a surging of&#xD;
voices without, and shouts of Ber-&#xD;
tani and vengeance came up through&#xD;
the air and broke the stillness with-&#xD;
in. Strict orders had been given&#xD;
that no one should be admitted to&#xD;
Bertani's room. Ina sat down by&#xD;
Emanuele's bedside. "Do not take&#xD;
away your hand," 'he said; "it does&#xD;
me good." .She left it in his. Thus&#xD;
they sat, silently, for hours. The&#xD;
doctor came and looked at Ina&#xD;
strangely. Was this pale woman,&#xD;
moving and looking like a spirit, the&#xD;
brilliant person to whom he had&#xD;
heard that Bertani was betrothed ?&#xD;
They had painted her as a Cleopa-&#xD;
tra, and Ina looked to him like&#xD;
the broken-hearted Mary ! He felt&#xD;

afraid to sit alone in their rooms, in the same place. I would rather&#xD;

state of excitement subsided, and    "I have a great deal to be grateful'&#xD;

&#xD;
INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Emanuele's pulse. Marcello looked&#xD;
at him; he saw him shake his head.&#xD;
He looked at the wound; it was&#xD;
bleeding afresh. There was no pos-&#xD;
sible hope, that he knew, but he&#xD;
could not bear to give him up. So&#xD;
strong, so stalwart a form, now pros-&#xD;
trate there; was it true that he&#xD;
could ' never  move   again ?  Her&#xD;
seemed to breathe with less difficulty,&#xD;
but he evidently did not know that&#xD;
the doctor was there. The doctor&#xD;
stood some time watching him, and&#xD;
then said, " I must go ; there is noth-&#xD;
ing more to be done !"&#xD;
" Doctor," said Emanuele, opening&#xD;
his eyes very suddenly, " there must&#xD;
be no trouble caused by my death;&#xD;
it was not from my friend's hand ;&#xD;
we were alone, but it came from&#xD;
without. I had a mortal enemy."&#xD;
Ina covered her face with her hands.&#xD;
"Do you understand it all?" he said&#xD;
dreamily, and then he muttered to&#xD;
himself, "-One enemy, one friend, two&#xD;
loves, both lost," a.nd he went on&#xD;
ever repeating these words, until&#xD;
gradually his voice died away ; then&#xD;
the room was perfectly still, and for&#xD;
hours Ina and Marcello sat with no&#xD;
sound between them save the tick-&#xD;
ing of. the clock, which sounded&#xD;
startlingly loud. Marcello went'up&#xD;
and put his hand on the pendulum;&#xD;
it seemed as if it was ticking away&#xD;
the life of him who lay there.&#xD;
Give me your hand, Ina," he&#xD;
said. " We are passing into the church.&#xD;
How lonely it looks.! but I will be&#xD;
your all! I will stand in the place&#xD;
of -your mother and your father and&#xD;
/your brother to you. Sweet, where is&#xD;
your ring ? Ah, who is that false&#xD;
monster who wooes you to be his ? Re,&#xD;
&#xD;
has betrayed his country and his&#xD;
wife and his son; strike. at himg&#xD;
Then he was silent. Later she heard&#xD;
him vhisper,"Camilla, forgive";c"Ina,&#xD;
forgive"; "Two to witness against&#xD;
me ! that is two too many !" ' All day&#xD;
this lasted, and at twilight he was&#xD;
quiet; by the dim light Ina saw a&#xD;
change come over his face ; he gasped,&#xD;
and then all was still. She called&#xD;
Marcello ; all was over. At that no-&#xD;
ment, as they both stood, awe-strick-&#xD;
en, before all that remained of&#xD;
Emanuele    Bertani, they  heard a&#xD;
rustle outside of the door. It opened&#xD;
noiselessly, and a woman glided in;.&#xD;
she went straight to the bed, gave&#xD;
one look at him she loved still, and&#xD;
then threw herself on her knees at&#xD;
his side, and burst into passionate&#xD;
sobs, that seemed as if they would&#xD;
break her heart. Ina, knelt down&#xD;
beside her, and, putting her arm&#xD;
around her neck, hid her face on her&#xD;
shoulder.  There was no rivalship&#xD;
between those two women now, they&#xD;
neither of them claimed the dead!&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
YEAR had passed by since Ber-&#xD;
A tani's death ; for two months&#xD;
nothing else had occupied the public&#xD;
mind. Why the murder had been&#xD;
committed, why Bertani had married&#xD;
Ina at the last, no one knew. No&#xD;
trace of the murderer ever was found.&#xD;
The whole of Turin was turned up-&#xD;
side down for. a time ;. the police&#xD;
were telegraphing all over the coun-&#xD;
try, but no track was found of him&#xD;
who had done the deed ; people were&#xD;
&#xD;
minister occupied his place. Imme-&#xD;
diately after his death Ina had gone&#xD;
back to Switzerland. She could not&#xD;
live there now, it was too full of&#xD;
terrible memories. She could not&#xD;
go where her home once was, for&#xD;
she knew not what had become&#xD;
of her brother and she dared not&#xD;
inquire; he was worse than   dead&#xD;
to her. She could not live in Turin,&#xD;
and she had determined to go to&#xD;
Genoa, to spend the rest of her weary&#xD;
days.&#xD;
She took Sofi and her baby, and&#xD;
found a little apartment there, where&#xD;
she could live modestly with them;&#xD;
for the small property'that Bertani&#xD;
had her son had inherited, and she&#xD;
was his natural guardian.  Ina was&#xD;
sitting by the fire. Sardo was ather&#xD;
feet; lie held the baby's little boot in&#xD;
his mouth. The baby was dark-eyed, a&#xD;
living resemblance of his father ; often&#xD;
when Ina looked at him    her face&#xD;
would become sadder still, and she&#xD;
would turn away, in the midst of her&#xD;
most tender caresses, and his most&#xD;
winning ways, to hide the great sigh&#xD;
that was rising to her heart. Little&#xD;
as lie was, he had expressions of his&#xD;
face that she thought terribly like&#xD;
Emanuele ; it was a new misery&#xD;
to~ her, and, passionately as she&#xD;
loved him, she never saw him with-&#xD;
out pain.&#xD;
"Madame," said Sofi, " will you&#xD;
never go out to take the fresh air?&#xD;
It breaks my heart to see you always&#xD;
&#xD;
two blessings."&#xD;
A knock was heard at the door.&#xD;
Ina started, and a deep color, the&#xD;
first Sofi had seen since her return,&#xD;
spread itself over her face. "For&#xD;
God's sake, go to the door, Sofi! and&#xD;
I will see no one, no one," she said in&#xD;
an agonized voice.&#xD;
"Is Madame Bertani in ?"    Ina&#xD;
started again ; it was the first time&#xD;
she had ever heard that name. How&#xD;
it knocked dully at her heart ! Yet it&#xD;
was not his, the one dreaded voice ;&#xD;
that was a relief. In a moment more&#xD;
Sofi came in smiling, and behind her&#xD;
was Marcello.   Ina's face flushed&#xD;
slightly, and she rose quickly to&#xD;
meet him; his face beamed with&#xD;
pleasure, and with deeper emotions, as&#xD;
he looked at her. " How long it'is,"&#xD;
he said, "since I have seen you ! I&#xD;
could not wait any longer. I wanted&#xD;
to see you in your new home ; to see&#xD;
Sofi and this lovely boy," he said,&#xD;
raising him in his arms, and throwing&#xD;
him up in the air. The child laughed,&#xD;
and said "Papa!" Marcello dropped&#xD;
him  quickly, and Ina turned away&#xD;
her head. " He is beautiful," said&#xD;
Marcello, "grand, magnificent.  He&#xD;
is very like his father, with all that&#xD;
was finest in his face, and a noble ex-&#xD;
pression."  He said this purposely.&#xD;
He thought it best to break the ice&#xD;
at once. Ina felt grateful to him,&#xD;
and she turned and smiled upon him&#xD;
a sad, gentle smile.&#xD;
" How is your mother ? " she said,&#xD;

"Do take her," said Sofi. " Poor&#xD;
thing ! she has never been out of the&#xD;
house since we first came here ; it is&#xD;
more than eleven months. I cannot&#xD;
force her out.'&#xD;
"1Do come, dear Ina, for my sake.&#xD;
It is not right to your boy to ,shut&#xD;
yourself up so; he will expect you&#xD;
to go with him some day, and you&#xD;
should be so proud to take him out!"&#xD;
" Well, I will go with you," said&#xD;
Ina; "if Sofi and baby will come too! '&#xD;
Many were the people that day that&#xD;
turned in the street to see the pale&#xD;
young lady and the beautiful laugh-&#xD;
ing boy.&#xD;
That evening, as they sat together,&#xD;
Marcello said,." I have good news,&#xD;
Ina, for you. 'Madame de Turenne is&#xD;
going to be married.;. she is engaged&#xD;
to her constant lover, Miro Raimondi.&#xD;
She has signed away the principal&#xD;
part of her fortune to an institution&#xD;
for orphans, just out of Turin, 'and&#xD;
she is going to live in the country&#xD;
with her husband; and when I asked&#xD;
her why she had not waited until&#xD;
her death before making such a mu-&#xD;
nificent gift, she said, with something&#xD;
of her old vivacity, ' I am tired of&#xD;
&#xD;
being rich, and now my caprice is to&#xD;
be poor ; if I am not satisfied, if the&#xD;
novelty palls after a time, I think I&#xD;
shall write for them to give it back&#xD;
to me ; do you not think that is a&#xD;
good arrangement?'     I wish you&#xD;
could see her now. I never saw her&#xD;
look half so charming before; and&#xD;
she sent more rove than I knew how&#xD;
to load myself with, and something,&#xD;
besides, that' I may not give," he&#xD;
said, with a pleasant laugh.&#xD;
"It is so delightful," said Ina, "to&#xD;
hear your voice again; it sounds like&#xD;
hope and promise ! You always were&#xD;
cheerful, Marcello, and one feels it&#xD;
in your presence.   I think, cheerful-&#xD;
ness one of the most beautiful gifts&#xD;
one can have. I hope my little Theo-&#xD;
dore will be so."&#xD;
"Ah, Ina, it is a plant that does&#xD;
not spread nor grow without cultiva-&#xD;
tion ; often when I feel most down=&#xD;
hearted, I Zry to shake it off by a&#xD;
manner that belies it. You must try,&#xD;
dear Ina, to create an atmosphere&#xD;
about your darling ; children, all the&#xD;
young, need the sunshine of life&#xD;
around them ; and that shines in the&#xD;
house as brightly as. without, if we&#xD;
choose."&#xD;
" Sofi often tells me so," said Ina,&#xD;
with a deep sigh. "I think I will fill&#xD;
the house with flowers ; that will&#xD;
make it look brighter.  I remember,&#xD;
when I was a little child, I loved&#xD;
roses better than any toys that muy&#xD;
mother bought me."&#xD;
" I- believe it," said Marcello ; "you&#xD;
must have taken them for your sis-&#xD;
ters."&#xD;
" I always used to ask my mamma&#xD;
to give me a little 'sister," said Ina.&#xD;
" I think the life of a child so lonely&#xD;
&#xD;
without other children. I often think&#xD;
that we must look like great giants&#xD;
to them, and frighten them  at first,&#xD;
as we do the birds, that are- not ac-&#xD;
customed to us."&#xD;
"But had you not a brother who&#xD;
was a companion for you ? "&#xD;
Ina's whole face was convulsed with&#xD;
pain; she rose and looked out of the&#xD;
window. Marcello sprang to her side.&#xD;
"Ina, what have I said ? what have'&#xD;
I unwittingly done ?"&#xD;
"Nothing," she said gently, putting&#xD;
her hand on his arm; "you are my&#xD;
only brother."&#xD;
He took her hand in his, and&#xD;
pressed it tp his lips. "Do notsayso,"&#xD;
he said. "I should never be satisfied&#xD;
thus. I must be nearer to, you, Ina,&#xD;
than that. You know that I love you&#xD;
with a 'love deeper, truer, intenser,&#xD;
than a brother gives. Ina, will you&#xD;
not be my wife?" She turned towards&#xD;
him and fixed her large blue eyes&#xD;
upon  him; all the light was gone&#xD;
out of them, just as he had seen them&#xD;
look that first day after the mask-&#xD;
ball; there was a vacant stare in&#xD;
them now as then ; it terrified him.&#xD;
" Ina," he said, " do you not under-&#xD;
stand me ? I love you!"&#xD;
"He said so too !" she said in a&#xD;
loiv, plaintive voice, not turning awayi&#xD;
her eyes, that had always the same&#xD;
expression, --l"he said so too!"&#xD;
"0 dearest, do not look at me so !&#xD;
Put your hand in mine, and say youj&#xD;
will be my beloved wife. Ina, for&#xD;
mercy's sake,. speak ! "&#xD;
"He asked me to be his wife," she&#xD;
said ; -"he said he loved me, and asked -&#xD;
me to be his wife." -&#xD;
Marcello turned away; he could I&#xD;
not stand it, that blank look cut him&#xD;
&#xD;
to the heart. " 0,"    said to him-&#xD;
self, "how much loger must I live&#xD;
alone, how much longer bear my&#xD;
sorrow? Why am I doomed to this&#xD;
lonely love ?" He went out of the&#xD;
room in search of the baby. The little&#xD;
Theodore crowed aloud when he saw&#xD;
him, and stretched out both his arms&#xD;
with a glad cry. "Papa," he said,&#xD;
pointing with his little finger, and&#xD;
looking around up into Sofi's face.&#xD;
" Do not let him say that," he said&#xD;
to Sofi; "it pains me !" and he took&#xD;
the child in his arms, and carried&#xD;
him in to Ina. When she saw her&#xD;
baby, all the natural look came back&#xD;
again into her face, and she looked at&#xD;
Marcello as if nothing especial had&#xD;
passed between them a moment be-&#xD;
fore. "God help her !" he said to him-&#xD;
self as he placed her little one in her&#xD;
arms, "but I will not leave her alone.&#xD;
This solitary life, ever dwelling on&#xD;
her grief, will kill her, or, worse than&#xD;
that, will put out the light of her&#xD;
mind. I promised her once that I&#xD;
would be a friend that asked for no&#xD;
recompense, and that I would serve&#xD;
her with all my soul; so it shall be."&#xD;
Marcello went back to Turin short-&#xD;
ly after this, but it was to make his&#xD;
preparations for transferring' his busi-&#xD;
ness to Genoa; before leaving he told&#xD;
Ina this, and she looked up in his face&#xD;
and smiled. He carried that smile&#xD;
in his heart, and it was the one&#xD;
flower in his lonely path, it was his&#xD;
arc-en-ciel, and he held it as a&#xD;
promise of brighter days. When he&#xD;
came back he brought his sister&#xD;
Adelheide to keep house for him, and&#xD;
often she used to pass the day with&#xD;
Ina, and there was life. in the quiet&#xD;
Little house ; and in a few months&#xD;

more Marcello spoke again to Ina,&#xD;
and again the terrible look came into&#xD;
her eyes, and dropped as a veil be-&#xD;
tween him and them, and she an-&#xD;
swered, "He said so too; he said he&#xD;
loved me, and asked me to be his&#xD;
wife!"   Marcello went back dis-&#xD;
heartened to- his lonely apartment,&#xD;
and that evening, as he sat moodily&#xD;
looking into the fire, his sister Adel-&#xD;
heide rose from her seat, and came&#xD;
around to where he was, and stood&#xD;
behind his chair, and put her arms&#xD;
about his neck, and her head down&#xD;
close to his ear, and whispered gently,&#xD;
"Dear brother, it is yet too soon ; wait,&#xD;
and, all will .be well."  Marcello&#xD;
kissed her hair, and a gleam of hope&#xD;
lighted his-eyes.&#xD;
And gradually Ina's color stole&#xD;
back into her face ; slowly,.slowly at&#xD;
first ; but Marcello and Adelheide&#xD;
saw that she should never be too&#xD;
much alone. They took her to walk,&#xD;
and to drive, and to row on the Medi-&#xD;
terranean Sea. First she let. herself&#xD;
be taken, as if she were a child without&#xD;
a will, and then the listless look left&#xD;
her face ; she would smile sweetly&#xD;
when her boy laughed, no longer&#xD;
that sad, wan smile; her step grew&#xD;
lighter, and her face got back its&#xD;
look- of youth.  Ina was twenty-two&#xD;
years old, and two years had rolled&#xD;
around since Emanuele's death. Ad-&#xD;
ellieide read with her, and whenever&#xD;
she saw the sharp look of pain pass&#xD;
over her face, she suddenly had some-&#xD;
where&amp;amp;to go where Ina must take her,&#xD;
or something important to ask that&#xD;
only ma could answer. Marcello&#xD;
was called away at this time on busi-&#xD;
ness to Turin; he came back sooner&#xD;
than he was expected. Ina was&#xD;

she was reading, and, hearing a step,&#xD;
turned, thinking it was Adelheide;&#xD;
but her whole face flushed crimson&#xD;
when she saw Marcello, and then she&#xD;
put out her hand and blushed again&#xD;
to .her temples as she said, "You&#xD;
took me so by surprise !"&#xD;
" I did not think 'myself," he said,&#xD;
"that I should return    so soon. I&#xD;
hastened back, fearing that Adelheide&#xD;
would not take good care of you in&#xD;
my absence. I have a letter for&#xD;
you; from whom, do you think ?"&#xD;
" Give it me," she said, holding&#xD;
out her hand, "and I shall not have&#xD;
to guess!!"  He handed it her; she&#xD;
broke the seal and read:-&#xD;
"DEAREST INA, - I know you will&#xD;
rejoice in my new happiness. I have&#xD;
a little boy ; he is just as lovely as he&#xD;
can be.   Marcello tells ine yours is&#xD;
prettier, bit he has no taste, and&#xD;
besides mine is a creature yet of&#xD;
promise, yours of fulfilment. Ah, Ina,&#xD;
I never knew before what it was to&#xD;
be happy, but I hold my little dar-&#xD;
ling in my arms, I look into his eyes,&#xD;
and I think that God is good and&#xD;
very merciful. I only pray to be&#xD;
worthy of all my blessings. Do you&#xD;
not think you could ever make up&#xD;
your mind to come and see me; to&#xD;
bring all your little family,-Sofi,&#xD;
Sardo, and, last of all, baby ? We live&#xD;
so quietly, we never see a soul. Miro&#xD;
and I are satisfied thus ; We are in&#xD;
the midst of the trees and flowers,&#xD;
our garden is our theatre, and every&#xD;
evening 'about twilight we go there&#xD;
to see the new little actors and fairy&#xD;
actresses. that have risen on the&#xD;
scene. If you do not come, dear Inia,&#xD;
&#xD;
INA.&#xD;
&#xD;
I shall have to threaten you with&#xD;
Miro, baby, nurse, and myself. Would&#xD;
you have room for us all ? This&#xD;
letter I shall send you by the con-&#xD;
stant, but unrewarded knight, who&#xD;
will hand it you. Do you not think it&#xD;
is just as well to give a little happi-&#xD;
ness in this world if we can ?  Fare-&#xD;
well!&#xD;
" With a kiss from baby, yours,&#xD;
"CAMILLA."&#xD;
.Ina blushed as she folded the let-&#xD;
ter, the, tears sprang to her eyes, but&#xD;
a smile played around her lips.&#xD;
"I am so glad that she is happy.&#xD;
You saw her then ? "&#xD;
"Yes, and I never- dreamed that&#xD;
she could look so beautiful; none of&#xD;
her dazzling jewels ever lent such a&#xD;
&#xD;
133&#xD;
&#xD;
grace to her as that look of mother-&#xD;
hood: does. She goes about, they tell&#xD;
me, doing good to everybody ; she&#xD;
visits the poor, watches with the sick,&#xD;
and is beloved by every one."&#xD;
" She is an angel," said Ina.&#xD;
"She is, and I know but one other&#xD;
who can compare with her; she visits&#xD;
the poor too, and watches with -the&#xD;
weary, but she, whilst she sheds&#xD;
warmth and comfort wherever she&#xD;
goes, will not let one ray brighten her&#xD;
own path ; she is charitable to all&#xD;
but to herself, and she condemns one&#xD;
who loves her better than life to&#xD;
live alone and sad, when she could&#xD;
open a heaven on earth to him."&#xD;
Ina's head sank upon his shoulder,&#xD;
as he drew her to him, and she Ihis-&#xD;
pered, "Marcello, I love you!"&#xD;
